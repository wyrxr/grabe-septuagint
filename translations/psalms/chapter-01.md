ΨΑΛΜ. Α'. 1.
Μακάριος ἀνὴρ ὃς οὐκ ἐπορεύθη ἐν βουλῇ ἀσεβῶν·
καὶ ἐν ὁδῷ ἁμαρτωλῶν οὐκ ἔστη,
καὶ ἐπὶ καθέδρᾳ λοιμῶν οὐκ ἐκάθισεν.
2 Ἀλλ' ἢ ἐν τῷ νόμῳ Κυρίου τὸ θέλημα αὐτοῦ,
καὶ ἐν τῷ νόμῳ αὐτοῦ μελετήσει ἡμέρας καὶ νυκτός.
3 Καὶ ἔσται ὡς τὸ ξύλον τὸ πεφυτευμένον παρὰ τὰς διεξόδους τῶν ὑδάτων,
ὃ τὸν καρπὸν αὐτοῦ δώσει ἐν καιρῷ αὐτοῦ,
καὶ τὸ φύλλον αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἀπορρυήσεται·
καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἂν ποιήσῃ κατευοδωθήσεται.
4 Οὐχ οὕτως οἱ ἀσεβεῖς, οὐχ οὕτως·
ἀλλ' ἢ ὡς ὁ χνοῦς, ὃν ἐκρίπτει ὁ ἄνεμος ἀπὸ προσώπου τῆς γῆς.
5 Διὰ τοῦτο οὐκ ἀναστήσονται ἀσεβεῖς ἐν κρίσει,
οὐδὲ οἱ ἁμαρτωλοὶ ἐν βουλῇ δικαίων.
6 Ὅτι γινώσκει Κύριος ὁδὸν δικαίων,
καὶ ὁδὸς ἀσεβῶν ἀπολεῖται.

PSALM 1

Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly,
Nor standeth in the path of sinners,
Nor sitteth in the seat of the pestilent.
But in the law of the Lord is his will,
And in His law shall he meditate both day and night.

And he shall be as a tree, which is planted by the outgoings of the waters,
That shall give its fruit in its season,
And its leaf shall not fall away;
And all things whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.

Not so are the ungodly, not so:
But as the chaff which the wind casteth from the face of the earth.
Therefore shall not the ungodly rise up in judgment,
Nor sinners in the counsel of the righteous.
For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous,
And the way of the ungodly shall perish.

Psalm 1

Blessed is the man who hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, nor in the way of sinners hath he stood, nor upon the seat of pestilent men hath he sat. But his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in His law doth he meditate day and night.

And he shall be as a tree that is planted by the channels of the waters, which its fruit shall yield in its own season, and its leaf shall not fall away; and whatsoever he might do shall be made to prosper.

Not so are the ungodly, not so; but [they are] as the chaff which the wind doth sweep from off the face of the earth.

For this cause the ungodly shall not rise up in the judgment, nor sinners [stand] in the council of the righteous.

For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous, but the way of the ungodly shall perish.
