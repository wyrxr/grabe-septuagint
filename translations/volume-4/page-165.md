Τὴν δὲ ἔφοδον μεταλαβὼν Ἰούδας, προεξαπέστειλεν ὁ Τιμόθεος τὰς
γυναῖκας καὶ τὰ τέκνα καὶ τὴν ἄλλην ἀποσκευὴν εἰς τὸ λεγό-
μενον Καρνίον· ἦν γὰρ δυσπολιόρκητον καὶ δυσπρόσιτον τὸ χω-
22 ρίον διὰ τὴν πάντων τῶν τόπων στενότητα. Ἐπιφανείσης δὲ τῆς
Ἰούδου σπείρας πρώτης, καὶ γενομένου δέους ἐπὶ τοὺς πολεμίους,
φόβου τε ἐκ τῆς τοῦ τὰ πάντα ἐφορῶντος ἀποφανείας γενομέ-
νου ἐπ᾽ αὐτούς, εἰς φυγὴν ὥρμησαν ἄλλος ἀλλαχῇ φερόμενος,
ὥστε πολλάκις ὑπὸ τῶν ἰδίων βλάπτεσθαι, καὶ ταῖς τῶν ξιφῶν
23 ἀκμαῖς ἀναπείρεσθαι. Ἐποιεῖτο δὲ τὸν διωγμὸν εὐτονώτερον
Ἰούδας, συγκεντῶν τοὺς ἀλιτηρίους, διέφθειρε δὲ εἰς μυριάδας
24 τρεῖς ἀνδρῶν. Αὐτὸς δὲ ὁ Τιμόθεος ἐμπεσὼν τοῖς περὶ τὸν Δωσίθεον
καὶ Σωσίπατρον, ἥξιου μετὰ πολλῆς γοητείας ἐξαῖναι σῶον αὐτόν·
διὰ τὸ πλειόνων μὲν γονεῖς, ὧν δὲ ἀδελφοὺς ἔχειν, καὶ τούτους
ἀλογηθῆναι συμβήσεται, εἰ ἀποθάνοι. 25 Πιστώσαντος δὲ αὐτοῦ διὰ
πλειόνων τὸν ὁρισμὸν ἀποκαταστήσειν τούτους ἀπημάντους, ἀπέλυσαν
αὐτὸν ἕνεκα τῆς τῶν ἀδελφῶν σωτηρίας. 26 Ἐξελθὼν δὲ ἐπὶ τὸ
Καρνίον καὶ τὸ Ἀτεργατεῖον, κατέσφαξε μυριάδας σωμάτων δύο
καὶ πεντακισχιλίους. 27 Καὶ μετὰ τὴν τούτων τροπὴν καὶ ἀπώλειαν
ἐπεστράτευσεν Ἰούδας καὶ ἐπὶ Ἐφρὼν, πόλιν ὀχυρὰν, ἐν ᾗ κατώκει
Λυσίας, καὶ πάμμεγα πλήθη· νεανίαι δὲ πρὸ τῶν τειχῶν καθεστῶτες
ῥωμαλέοι ἀπεμάχοντο εὐρώστως. ἐνθάδε ὀργάνων καὶ βελῶν πολλαὶ
28 παραθέσεις ὑπῆρχον. Ἐπικαλεσάμενοι δὲ τὸν δυνάστην, τὸν μετὰ
κράτους συντρίβοντα τὰς τῶν πολεμίων ἀλκάς, ἔλαβον τὴν πόλιν
ὑποχείριον, καὶ κατέστρωσαν τῶν ἔνδον εἰς μυριάδας δύο καὶ
29 πεντακισχιλίους. Ἀναζεύξαντες δὲ ἐκεῖθεν, ὥρμησαν ἐπὶ Σκυθῶν
30 πόλιν, ἀπέχουσαν ἀπὸ Ἱεροσολύμων σταδίους ἑξακοσίους. Ἀπο-
μαρτυρησάντων δὲ τῶν ἐκεῖ κατοικούντων Ἰουδαίων, ἦν οἱ Σκυ-
θοπολῖται ἔχον πρὸς αὐτοὺς εὔνοιαν, καὶ ἐν τοῖς τῆς ἀτυχίας
31 καιροῖς ἥμερον ἀπάντησιν ἐπεδύτο. Εὐχαριστήσαντες αὐτοῖς,
καὶ προσπαρακαλέσαντες καὶ εἰς τὰ λοιπὰ πρὸς τὸ γένος εὐ-
μενεῖς εἶναι, παρεγένοντο εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα, τῆς τῶν ἑβδομάδων ἑορ-
32 τῆς οὔσης ὑπογίου. Μετὰ δὲ τὴν λεγομένην Πεντηκοστὴν, ὥρ-
33 μησαν ἐπὶ Γοργίαν τὸν τῆς Ἰδουμαίας στρατηγόν. Ἐξῆλθε δὲ
34 μετὰ πεζῶν τρισχιλίων, ἱππέων δὲ τετρακοσίων. Καὶ παρατα-
35 ξαμένων συνέβη πεσεῖν ὀλίγους τῶν Ἰουδαίων. Δωσίθεος δέ τις

**Chapter 12**

**21** Now when Judas had received intelligence of this assault, Timothy sent forth before him the women and the children and all the other baggage unto the place which was called Carnion; for the region was difficult to besiege and hard to approach, by reason of the narrowness of all the pathways.
**22** And when the first company of Judas had appeared, a terror fell upon the adversaries, and a fear, borne of the manifestation of Him Who oversees all things, came upon them; wherefore they rushed into flight, each one turning aside in his own way, so that oftentimes they were wounded by their own [men], and were impaled upon the points of their swords.
**23** And Judas did pursue them more vigorously, gathering together the impious ones, and he slew as many as thirty thousand men.
**24** Now Timothy himself, having fallen among those with Dositheus and Sosipater, earnestly entreated with much [cunning] persuasion that he might be saved alive; for he had many dependents, namely his parents and his brothers, and these would be utterly neglected, should he perish.
**25** And when he had by many [oaths] confirmed his promise that he would restore them unharmed, they released him for the sake of the deliverance of their brethren.
**26** And going forth unto Carnion and the temple of Atargatis, he slew twenty-five thousand persons.
**27** And after the rout and destruction of these, Judas also led his army against Ephron, a strong city, wherein dwelt Lysias, and very great multitudes [of people]; and vigorous young men, standing before the walls, did fight valiantly. And therein were many provisions of engines of war and darts.
**28** But having called upon the Mighty One, who with power shatters the might of his foes, they took the city into their power, and they laid low of those within twenty-five thousand [men].
**29** And departing from thence, they marched against Scythopolis, a city distant from Jerusalem six hundred furlongs.
**30** And when the Jews dwelling there bore witness that the Scythopolitans did bear goodwill toward them, and in times of adversity had shown a gentle welcome.
**31** And giving them thanks, and moreover exhorting them to be favorable unto their nation in the time to come, they came unto Jerusalem, as the Feast of Weeks was drawing nigh.
**32** Now after that which is called Pentecost, they marched against Gorgias, the governor of Idumea.
**33** And he came forth with three thousand footmen, and four hundred horsemen.
**34** And when they had set themselves in battle array, it came to pass that a few of the Jews fell.
**35** But a certain Dositheus...
