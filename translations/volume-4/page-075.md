οὐκ ἐγεύσατο, οὐδὲ ὕδωρ ἔπιε, πενθῶν ἐπὶ τῶν ἀνομιῶν τῶν με-
3 γάλων τοῦ πλήθους. Καὶ ἐγένετο κήρυγμα ἐν ὅλῃ τῇ Ἰουδαίᾳ καὶ
Ἱερουσαλὴμ πᾶσι τοῖς ἐκ τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας, συναχθῆναι εἰς Ἱε-
4 ρουσαλήμ, καὶ ὅσοι ἐὰν μὴ ἀπαντήσωσιν ἐν δυσὶν ἢ τρισὶν ἡμέ-
ραις κατὰ τὸ κρῖμα τῶν προκαθημένων πρεσβυτέρων, ἀνιερῶθή-
σονται τὰ κτήνη αὑτῶν, καὶ αὐτὸς ἀλλοτριωθήσεται ἀπὸ τοῦ
5 πλήθους τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας. Καὶ ἐπισυνήχθησαν πάντες οἱ ἐκ τῆς
φυλῆς Ἰούδα καὶ Βενιαμεῖν ἐν τρισὶν ἡμέραις εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ.
6 οὗτος ὁ μὴν ἔνατος τῇ εἰκάδι τοῦ μηνός. Καὶ συνεκάθισε πᾶν
τὸ πλῆθος ἐν τῷ εὐρυχώρῳ τοῦ ἱεροῦ, τρέμοντες διὰ τὸν ἐνεστῶτα
7 χειμῶνα. Καὶ ἀναστὰς Ἔζρας εἶπεν αὐτοῖς. ὑμεῖς ἠνομήσατε
καὶ συνωκίσατε γυναῖκας ἀλλογενεῖς, τοῦ προσθεῖναι ἁμαρτίας
8 τῷ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ νῦν δότε ὁμολογίαν δόξαν τῷ Κυρίῳ Θεῷ τῶν
9 πατέρων ἡμῶν, καὶ ποιήσατε τὸ θέλημα αὐτοῦ, καὶ χωρίσθητε
ἀπὸ τῶν ἐθνῶν τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν γυναικῶν τῶν ἀλλογενῶν.
10 Καὶ ἐφώνησαν ἅπαν τὸ πλῆθος, καὶ εἶπαν μεγάλῃ τῇ φωνῇ· οὕ-
11 τως ὡς εἴρηκας, ποιήσομεν. Ἀλλὰ τὸ πλῆθος πολύ, καὶ ἡ ὥρα
χειμερινή, καὶ οὐκ ἰσχύομεν στῆναι αἴθριοι. καὶ τὸ ἔργον οὐκ
ἔστιν ἡμῖν ἡμέρας μιᾶς οὐδὲ δύο. ἐπὶ πλεῖον γὰρ ἡμάρτομεν ἐν
12 τούτοις. Στήτωσαν δὲ οἱ προηγούμενοι τοῦ πλήθους, καὶ πάντες
οἱ ἐκ τῶν κατοικιῶν ἡμῶν ὅσοι ἔχουσι γυναῖκας ἀλλογενεῖς, πα-
13 ραγενηθήτωσαν λαβόντες χρόνον, καὶ ἑκάστου δὲ τόπου τοὺς πρε-
σβυτέρους καὶ τοὺς κριτάς, ἕως τοῦ λῦσαι τὴν ὀργὴν τοῦ Κυρίου
14 ἀφ᾽ ἡμῶν τοῦ πράγματος τούτου. Ἰωνάθας Ἀζαήλου, καὶ Ἐζε-
κίας Θωκανοῦ ἐπεδέξαντο κατὰ ταῦτα. καὶ Μοσόλλαμος, καὶ
15 Λευίς, καὶ Σαββαταῖος συνεβράδευσαν αὐτοῖς. Καὶ ἐποίησαν κατὰ
16 πάντα ταῦτα οἱ ἐκ τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας. Καὶ ἐπελέξατο ἑαυτῷ Ἔζ-
ρας ὁ ἱερεὺς ἄνδρας ἡγουμένους τῶν πατριῶν αὑτῶν κατ᾽ ὄνομα
πάντας, καὶ συνεκάθισαν τῇ νουμηνίᾳ τοῦ μηνὸς τοῦ δεκάτου,
17 ἐτάσαι τὸ πρᾶγμα. Καὶ ἤχθη ἐπὶ πέρας τὰ κατὰ τοὺς ἄνδρας
τοὺς ἐπισυνέχοντας γυναῖκας ἀλλογενεῖς, ἕως τῆς νουμηνίας τοῦ
18 πρώτου μηνός. Καὶ εὑρέθησαν τῶν ἱερέων οἱ ἐπισυναχθέντες ἀλ-
19 λογενεῖς γυναῖκας ἔχοντες, ἐκ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰησοῦ τοῦ Ἰωσεδέκ, καὶ
τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτοῦ Μαθήλας, καὶ Ἐλεάζαρος, καὶ Ἰώριβος, καὶ
20 Ἰωαδάνος. Καὶ ἐπέβαλον τὰς χεῖρας ἐκβαλεῖν τὰς γυναῖκας ἑαυ-

**Chapter 9**
...he tasted no bread, neither drank he water, mourning over the great iniquities of the multitude.

**3** And there was a proclamation throughout all Judea and Jerusalem unto all those of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem;
**4** and whosoever would not appear within two or three days, according to the judgment of the presiding elders, his possessions should be forfeited, and he himself should be estranged from the multitude of the captivity.
**5** And all those from the tribe of Judah and Benjamin were gathered together unto Jerusalem within three days.
**6** This was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month. And all the multitude sat together in the spacious place before the temple, trembling because of the present winter.
**7** And Ezra arose and said unto them, "Ye have committed lawless deeds and have married foreign women, to the end that ye might add sins unto Israel.
**8** And now, give ye a confession [and] glory unto the Lord God of our fathers,
**9** and do His will, and separate yourselves from the nations of the land, and from the foreign women."
**10** Then all the multitude cried out and said with a loud voice, "Thus as thou hast spoken, so will we do.
**11** But the multitude is great, and the season is wintry, and we are not able to stand [exposed] to the open air. And this work is not [one] for us of one day, nor of two; for we have sinned exceedingly in these matters.
**12** Let, therefore, the leaders of the multitude stand [forth], and all those from our households who have foreign wives,
**13** let them come at an appointed time, and [with them] the elders and the judges of every place, until the wrath of the Lord concerning this matter be removed from us."
**14** Then Jonathan the son of Asahel, and Hezekiah the son of Thocanus, accepted [this task] according to these things.
**15** And Mosollamus, and Levis, and Sabbataeus assisted them.
**16** And those of the captivity did according to all these things. And Ezra the priest chose unto himself men, [even] the leaders of their fathers' houses, all by name; and they sat together on the new moon of the tenth month,
**17** to settle the matter. And the matters concerning the men who retained foreign wives were brought to a conclusion by the new moon of the first month.
**18** And there were found among the priests, of those who had been gathered, [men] having foreign wives:
**19** from the sons of Jesus the son of Josedek, and of his brethren: Matheles, and Eleazar, and Iorib, and Ioadanos.
**20** And they laid their hands [in pledge] to cast out their wives,
**21** and [they offered] rams for an atonement for their ignorance. And from
