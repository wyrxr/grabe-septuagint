ΚΕΦ. Α´. ῚΗΣΟΥ ΥΙΟΥ ΣΙΡΑΧ 1825
ἐν νεότητι, καὶ μὴ παρίδῃς τὰς ἀγνοίας αὐτοῦ· κάμψον τὸν τρά- 12
χηλον αὐτοῦ ἐν νεότητι, καὶ θλάσον τὰς πλευρὰς αὐτοῦ, ἕως
ἐστὶ νήπιος· μήποτε σκληνυνθεὶς ἀπειθήσῃ σοι, καὶ ἔσται σοι
ὀδύνη ψυχῆς. Παίδευσον τὸν υἱόν σου, καὶ ἔργασαι ἐν αὐτῷ, ἵνα 13
μὴ ἐν τῇ ἀσχημοσύνῃ αὐτοῦ προσκόψῃς.

Περὶ ὑγείας.

Κρεῖσσον πτωχὸς ὑγιὴς καὶ ἰσχύων τῇ ἔξει, ἢ πλούσιος μεμα- 14
στιγωμένος εἰς σῶμα αὐτοῦ· ὑγιεία καὶ εὐεξία βελτίων παντὸς 15
χρυσίου, καὶ σῶμα εὔρωστον ἢ ὄλβος ἀμέτρητος· οὐκ ἔστι πλοῦ- 16
τος βελτίων ὑγιείας σώματος, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν εὐφροσύνη ὑπὲρ χα-
ρὰν καρδίας. Κρεῖσσον θάνατος ὑπὲρ ζωὴν πικρὰν ἢ ἀρρώστημα 17
ἔμμονον. Ἀγαθὰ ἐκκεχυμένα ἐπὶ στόματι κεκλεισμένῳ, θέματα 18
βρωμάτων παρακείμενα ἐπὶ τάφῳ· τί συμφέρει κάρπωσις εἰδώλῳ; 19
οὔτε γὰρ ἔδεται, οὔτε μὴ ὀσφρανθῇ· οὕτως ὁ ἐκδιωκόμενος ὑπὸ 20
Κυρίου, βλέπων ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς καὶ στενάζων, ὥσπερ εὐνοῦχος
περιλαμβάνων παρθένον καὶ στενάζων. Μὴ δῶς εἰς λύπην τὴν 21
ψυχήν σου, καὶ μὴ θλίψῃς σεαυτὸν ἐν βουλῇ σου. Εὐφροσύνη καρ- 22
δίας ζωὴ ἀνθρώπου, καὶ ἀγαλλίαμα ἀνδρὸς μακροημέρευσις.
Ἀγάπα τὴν ψυχήν σου, καὶ παρακάλει τὴν καρδίαν σου, καὶ λύ- 23
πην μακρὰν ἀπόστησον ἀπὸ σοῦ· πολλοὺς γὰρ ἀπώλεσε λύπη, καὶ
οὐκ ἔστιν ὠφέλεια ἐν αὐτῇ. Ζῆλος καὶ θυμὸς ἐλαττοῦσιν ἡμέρας, 24
καὶ πρὸ καιροῦ γῆρας ἄγει μέριμνα.

Κἀγὼ ἔσχατος ἠγρύπνησα· ὡς καλαμώμενος ὀπίσω τρυγητῶν 16
ἐν εὐλογίᾳ Κυρίου ἔφθασα, καὶ ὡς τρυγῶν ἐπλήρωσα ληνόν. Κα- 17
τανοήσατε ὅτι οὐκ ἐμοὶ μόνῳ ἐκοπίασα, ἀλλὰ πᾶσι τοῖς ζητοῦσι παι-
δείαν. Ἀκούσατέ μου μεγιστάνες λαοῦ, καὶ οἱ ἡγούμενοι ἐκκλη- 18
σίας ἐνωτίσασθε. Υἱῷ καὶ γυναικί, ἀδελφῷ καὶ φίλῳ, μὴ δῶς ἐξου- 19
σίαν ἐπὶ σὲ ἐν ζωῇ σου, καὶ μὴ δῶς ἑτέρῳ τὰ χρήματά σου, ἵνα
μὴ μεταμεληθεὶς δέῃ περὶ αὐτῶν· ἕως ἔτι ζῇς καὶ πνοὴ ἐν σοί, μὴ 20
ἀλλάξῃς σεαυτὸν (ἐν) πάσῃ σαρκί· κρεῖσσον γάρ ἐστι τὰ τέκνα 21
δεηθῆναί σου, ἢ σὲ ἐμβλέπειν εἰς χεῖρας υἱῶν σου. Ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς 22
(Τόμ. Δ´.) 19ῒ

**Chapter Thirty**

12 in [his] youth, and overlook not his ignorances;
    bend his neck in [his] youth,
    and crush his ribs, while he is a babe;
    lest he become hardened, and disobey thee,
    and it be to thee a sorrow of soul.
13 Chasten thy son, and labor with him,
    that thou stumble not in his shamelessness.

**Concerning Health**

14 Better is a poor man, healthy and strong in his constitution,
    than a rich man scourged in his own body.
15 Health and soundness of body are better than all gold,
    and a robust body than immeasurable wealth.
16 There is no wealth better than health of body,
    and no joy above the gladness of heart.
17 Better is death than a bitter life,
    or an enduring sickness.
18 Good things poured forth upon a closed mouth
    are as dishes of food placed upon a tomb.
19 What profit hath an idol from enjoying [food]?
    For neither shall it eat, nor shall it smell.
20 Thus is he who is pursued by the Lord,
    seeing with his eyes and groaning,
    as a eunuch embracing a virgin and groaning.
21 Give not thy soul to sorrow,
    and afflict not thyself in thy counsel.
22 Gladness of heart is the life of man,
    and the rejoicing of a man is length of days.
23 Love thy soul, and comfort thy heart,
    and sorrow cast far from thee;
    for sorrow hath destroyed many,
    and there is no profit in it.
24 Envy and wrath shorten days,
    and before its time, anxiety bringeth old age.

16 And I, the last, kept watch;
    as one gleaning after reapers in the blessing of the Lord have I attained,
    and as one gathering grapes have I filled the winepress.
17 Understand ye that not for myself alone have I labored,
    but for all them that seek instruction.
18 Hearken unto me, ye great ones of the people,
    and ye leaders of the assembly, give ear.
19 To son and wife, to brother and friend,
    give not authority over thee in thy life,
    and give not thy possessions to another,
    lest thou repent and beg for them.
20 While thou still livest and breath is in thee,
    change not thyself amongst all flesh.
21 For it is better that thy children should beg of thee,
    than that thou shouldst look to the hands of thy sons.
22 In all thy works...
