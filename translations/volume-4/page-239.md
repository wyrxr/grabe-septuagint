**10** ἐφίσταται ἔρευνα. Πρὸς ὑμᾶς οὖν ὦ τύραννοι οἱ λόγοι μου, ἵνα
**11** μάθητε σοφίαν καὶ μὴ παραπέσητε. Οἱ γὰρ φυλάξαντες ὁσίως
τὰ ὅσια, ὁσιωθήσονται· καὶ εἰ διδαχθέντες αὐτὰ, εὑρήσουσιν ἀπο-
**12** λογίαν. Ἐπιθυμήσατε οὖν τῶν λόγων μου· ποθήσατε καὶ παι-
**13** δευθήσεσθε. Λαμπρὰ καὶ ἀμάραντος ἐστιν ἡ σοφία, καὶ εὐχε-
ρῶς θεωρεῖται ὑπὸ τῶν ἀγαπώντων αὐτήν, καὶ εὑρίσκεται ὑπὸ
**14** τῶν ζητούντων αὐτήν· φθάνει τοὺς ἐπιθυμοῦντας προγνωσθῆναι.
**15** Ὁ ὀρθρίσας πρὸς αὐτὴν οὐ κοπιάσει· πάρεδρον γὰρ εὑρήσει τῶν
**16** πυλῶν αὐτοῦ. Τὸ γὰρ ἐνθυμηθῆναι περὶ αὐτῆς, φρονήσεως τε-
λειότης, καὶ ὁ ἀγρυπνήσας δι᾿ αὐτὴν ταχέως ἀμέριμνος ἔσται·
**17** ὅτι τοὺς ἀξίους αὐτῆς αὕτη περιέρχεται ζητοῦσα, καὶ ἐν ταῖς
τρίβοις φαντάζεται αὐτοῖς εὐμενῶς, καὶ ἐν πάσῃ ἐπινοίᾳ ἀπαντᾷ
**18**. **19** αὐτοῖς. Ἀρχὴ γὰρ αὐτῆς ἡ ἀληθεστάτη παιδείας ἐπιθυμία, φρον-
τὶς δὲ παιδείας ἀγάπη, ἀγάπη δὲ τήρησις νόμων αὐτῆς, προσο-
**20** χὴ δὲ νόμων βεβαίωσις ἀφθαρσίας, ἀφθαρσία δὲ ἐγγύς εἶναι
**21**. **22** ποιεῖ Θεοῦ· ἐπιθυμία ἄρα σοφίας ἀνάγει ἐπὶ βασιλείαν. Εἰ
**23** οὖν ἤδεσθε ἐπὶ θρόνοις καὶ σκήπτροις τύραννοι λαῶν, τιμήσατε
**24** σοφίαν, ἵνα εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα βασιλεύσητε. Τί δέ ἐστι σοφία καὶ
πῶς ἐγένετο, ἀπαγγελῶ, καὶ οὐκ ἀποκρύψω ὑμῖν μυστήρια, ἀλλὰ
ἀπ᾿ ἀρχῆς γενέσεως ἐξιχνιάσω, καὶ θήσω εἰς τὸ ἐμφανὲς τὴν
**25** γνῶσιν αὐτῆς, καὶ οὐ μὴ παροδεύσω τὴν ἀλήθειαν· οὔτε μὴν
**26** φθόνῳ τετηκότι συνοδεύσω, ἔτι οὗτος οὐ κοινωνεῖ σοφίᾳ. Πλῆ-
θος δὲ σοφῶν σωτηρία κόσμου, καὶ βασιλεὺς φρόνιμος εὐστά-
**27** θεια δήμου· ὥστε παιδεύεσθε τοῖς ῥήμασί μου, καὶ ὠφεληθήσεσθε.

**CHAPTER VII.**

**1** Εἰμι μὲν κἀγὼ θνητὸς ἄνθρωπος, ἴσος ἅπασιν, καὶ γηγε-
νοῦς ἀπόγονος πρωτοπλάστου· καὶ ἐν κοιλίᾳ μητρὸς ἐγλύφην
**2** σάρξ, δεκαμηνιαίῳ χρόνῳ παγεὶς ἐν αἵματι, ἐκ σπέρματος ἀν-
**3** δρὸς καὶ ἡδονῆς ὕπνῳ συνελθούσης· καὶ ἐγὼ δὲ γενόμενος ἔσπασα
τὸν κοινὸν ἀέρα, καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν ὁμοιοπαθῆ κατέπεσον γῆν, πρώ-
**4** την φωνὴν τὴν ὁμοίαν πᾶσιν ἦχα κλαίων· ἐν σπαργάνοις ἀνε-
**5** τράφην καὶ φροντίσιν· οὐδεὶς γὰρ βασιλέων ἑτέραν ἔσχε γενέ-

**CHAPTER VI.**

**10** a severe inquiry ariseth. Therefore, unto you, O ye tyrants, are my words, that ye may
**11** learn wisdom and not fall away. For they that have kept holy things holily, shall be made holy; and if, having been taught them, they shall find a defense.
**12** Desire therefore my words; long for them and ye shall be instructed.
**13** Bright and unfading is wisdom, and easily is she beheld by them that love her, and found by
**14** them that seek her. She anticipateth them that desire to be known [by her].
**15** He that riseth early unto her shall not toil; for he shall find her sitting at his gates.
**16** For to meditate upon her is the perfection of understanding, and he that watcheth for her sake shall quickly be free from care;
**17** for she goeth about seeking those who are worthy of her, and in the pathways she graciously appeareth unto them, and in every thought she meeteth them.
**18** For the beginning of her is the truest desire for instruction, and the care for instruction is love,
**19** and love is the keeping of her laws, and the observance
**20** of laws is the assurance of incorruption, and incorruption maketh one to be near
**21** God.
**22** Therefore the desire for wisdom leadeth unto a kingdom.
**23** If then ye delight in thrones and scepters, O ye rulers of peoples, honor wisdom,
**24** that ye may reign forevermore. And what wisdom is, and how she came to be, I will declare, and I will not hide from you mysteries, but from the beginning of creation will I trace her out, and will set forth to the manifest [view] the
**25** knowledge of her, and I will not pass over the truth; nor indeed
**26** will I walk with consuming envy, for this [envy] doth not share in wisdom. But the multitude of the wise is the salvation of the world, and a prudent king is the stability
**27** of the people; wherefore, be ye instructed by my words, and ye shall profit.

**CHAPTER VII.**

**1** I myself am also a mortal man, equal to all, and a descendant of the earth-born first-formed [man]; and in my mother's womb was I molded
**2** flesh, congealed in blood for a ten-month period, from the seed of a man
**3** and of pleasure coming together in sleep. And I, having been born, did draw the common air, and upon the earth, which suffereth the like, I fell, uttering for my first
**4** voice the cry like unto all, weeping. In swaddling clothes was I reared
**5** and in cares. For no king hath had another beginning of his birth,
**6** but one is the entrance of all into life, and the exit also is alike.
**7** For this cause I prayed, and understanding was given unto me; I called upon [God], and
