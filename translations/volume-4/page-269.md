ΙΗΣΟΥ ΥΙΟΥ ΣΙΡΑΧ 1800
ΚΕΦ. Ι΄. Χ.
`24` οὐ καθῆκεν δοξάσαι ἄνδρα ἁμαρτωλόν. Μεγιστὰς
    δυνάστης δοξασθήσεται· καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν αὐτῶν τις μείζων τῶν
`25` φοβουμένων τὸν Κύριον. Οἰκέτῃ σοφῷ ἐλεύθεροι λειτουργήσουσι·
`26` καὶ ἀνὴρ ἐπιστήμων οὐ γογγύσει παιδευόμενος. Μὴ σοφίζου ποιῆσαι
`27` τὸ ἔργον σου, καὶ μὴ δοξάζου ἐν καιρῷ στενοχωρίας σου· χρείσσων
    ἐργαζόμενος καὶ περισσεύων ἐν πᾶσιν, ἢ περιπατῶν δοξαζόμενος
`28` καὶ ὑστερῶν ἄρτων. Τέκνον, ἐν πραΰτητι δόξασον τὴν
`29` ψυχήν σου, καὶ δὸς αὐτῇ τιμὴν κατὰ τὴν ἀξίαν αὐτῆς. Τὸν ἁμαρτάνοντα
    εἰς ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ τίς δικαιώσει; καὶ τίς δοξάσει τὸν
`30` ἀτιμάζοντα τὴν ζωὴν αὐτοῦ; Πτωχὸς δοξάζεται δι᾿ ἐπιστήμην
`31` αὐτοῦ, καὶ πλούσιος δοξάζεται διὰ τὸν πλοῦτον αὐτοῦ. Ὁ δεδοξασμένος
    ἐν πτωχείᾳ, καὶ ἐν πλούτῳ ποσαχῶς; καὶ ὁ ἄδοξος ἐν
    πλούτῳ, καὶ ἐν πτωχείᾳ ποσαχῶς;

ΚΕΦ. ΙΑ΄. ΧΙ.

`1` ΣΟΦΙΑ ταπεινοῦ ἀνυψώσει κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐν μέσῳ μεγιστάνων
`2` καθίσει αὐτόν. Μὴ αἰνέσης ἄνδρα ἐν κάλλει αὐτοῦ, καὶ μὴ
`3` βδελύξῃ ἄνθρωπον ἐν δράσει αὐτοῦ. Μικρὰ ἐν πετεινοῖς μέλισσα,
`4` καὶ ἀρχὴ γλυκασμάτων ὁ καρπὸς αὐτῆς. Ἐν περιβολῇ ἱματίων μὴ
    καυχήσῃ, καὶ ἐν ἡμέρᾳ δόξης μὴ ἐπαίρου· ὅτι θαυμαστὰ τὰ ἔργα
`5` Κυρίου, καὶ κρυπτὰ τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ ἐν ἀνθρώποις. Πολλοὶ τύραννοι
`6` ἐκάθισαν ἐπὶ ἐδάφους, ὁ δὲ ἀνυπονόητος ἐφόρεσε διάδημα· πολλοὶ
    δυνάσται ἠτιμάσθησαν σφόδρα, καὶ ἔνδοξοι παρεδόθησαν εἰς χεῖρας
`7` ἑτέρων. Πρὶν ἢ ἐξετάσῃς μὴ μέμψῃ δι᾿ ἀκοῆς· νόησον πρῶτον, καὶ
`8` τότε ἐπιτίμα. Πρὶν ἀκοῦσαι, μὴ ἀποκρίνου ῥῆμα· καὶ ἐν μέσῳ λόγων
`9` μὴ παρεμβάλλου. Περὶ πράγματος οὗ οὐκ ἔστι σοι χρεία, μὴ
`10` ἔριζε, καὶ ἐν κρίσει ἁμαρτωλῶν μὴ συνέδρευε. Τέκνον, μὴ περὶ πολλὰ
    ἔστωσαν αἱ πράξεις σου· ἐὰν πληθυνθῇς, οὐκ ἀθωωθήσῃ, καὶ ἐὰν
`11` διώκῃς, οὐ μὴ καταλάβῃς, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἐκφύγῃς διαδρὰς. Ἔστι κοπιῶν
`12` καὶ πονῶν καὶ σπεύδων, καὶ τόσῳ μᾶλλον ὑστερεῖται. Ἔστι νωθρὸς
    προσδεόμενος ἀντιλήψεως, ὑστερῶν ἰσχύϊ, καὶ πτωχείᾳ περισσεύει·
    καὶ οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ Κυρίου ἐπέβλεψαν αὐτῷ εἰς ἀγαθά, καὶ ἀνώρθωσεν
`13` αὐτὸν ἐκ ταπεινώσεως αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀνύψωσε κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ
`14` ἀπὸ συντριβῆς, καὶ ἀπεθαύμασαν ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ πολλοί. Ἀγαθὰ
    καὶ κακά, ζωὴ καὶ θάνατος, πτωχεία καὶ πλοῦτος παρὰ Κυρίου

**Chapter Ten**

`24` nor is it fitting to glorify a sinful man. A great potentate shall be glorified; yet none of them is greater than they that fear the Lord.
`25` Unto a wise servant shall freemen minister; `26` and a man of understanding shall not murmur, being instructed. Be not cunning to do thy work, `27` and glorify not thyself in the time of thy distress. Better is one working and abounding in all things, than one walking about glorified `28` and lacking bread. My son, in meekness glorify thy soul, `29` and give unto it honor according to its worth. Who shall justify him that sinneth against his own soul? And who shall glorify him `30` that dishonoreth his own life? A poor man is glorified by his understanding, `31` and a rich man is glorified by his wealth. He that is glorified in poverty, and in riches, how many ways? And he that is without glory in riches, and in poverty, how many ways?

**Chapter Eleven**

`1` The wisdom of the humble shall lift up his head, and in the midst of magnates shall it seat him.
`2` Praise not a man for his beauty, `3` and abhor not a man for his appearance. Among flying creatures, the bee is small, `4` yet the beginning of all sweet things is her fruit. Boast not in the raiment of thy garments, and in the day of glory be not uplifted; for marvelous are the works `5` of the Lord, and hidden are His works among men. Many tyrants `6` have sat upon the ground, yet the unexpected one hath worn a diadem. Many potentates have been greatly dishonored, and the glorious have been delivered into the hands `7` of others. Before thou dost examine, blame not by [mere] hearing; understand first, and `8` then rebuke. Before thou dost hear, answer not a word; and in the midst of words, `9` do not interject. Concerning a matter wherein thou hast no need, `10` contend not; and in the judgment of sinners, do not sit [with them]. My son, let not thy deeds be concerning many things; if thou art multiplied, thou shalt not be acquitted; and if `11` thou dost pursue, thou shalt not overtake, and thou shalt not escape as a fugitive. There is one who toileth `12` and laboureth and hasteneth, and by so much the more doth he come to lack. There is one that is sluggish, needing assistance, lacking in strength, and abounding in poverty; yet the eyes of the Lord have looked upon him for good, and He hath raised `13` him up from his humiliation, and hath lifted up his head `14` from his brokenness, and many have marveled at him. Good things and evil things, life and death, poverty and riches, are from the Lord.
