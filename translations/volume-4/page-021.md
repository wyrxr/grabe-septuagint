1 Ἔτους δωδεκάτου τῆς βασιλείας Ναβουχοδονόσορ, ὃς ἐβασίλευσεν Ἀσσυρίων ἐν Νινευῇ τῇ πόλει τῇ μεγάλῃ, ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις
2 Ἀρφαξὰδ, ὃς ἐβασίλευσε Μήδων ἐν Ἐκβατάνοις, καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν ἐπ᾿ Ἐκβατάνων κύκλῳ τείχη ἐκ λίθων λελαξευμένων, εἰς πλάτος πηχῶν τριῶν, καὶ εἰς μῆκος πηχῶν ἕξ· καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ ὕψος τοῦ τείχους πηχῶν ἑβδομήκοντα, καὶ τὸ πλάτος αὐτοῦ πηχῶν
3 πεντήκοντα. Καὶ τοὺς πύργους αὐτοῦ ἔστησεν ἐπὶ ταῖς πύλαις αὐτῆς πηχῶν ἑκατὸν, καὶ τὸ πλάτος αὐτῆς ἐθεμελίωσεν
4 εἰς πήχεις ἑξήκοντα. Καὶ ἐποίησε τὰς πύλας αὐτῆς πύλας διεγειρομένας εἰς ὕψος πηχῶν ἑβδομήκοντα, καὶ τὸ πλάτος αὐτῶν πήχεις τεσσαράκοντα, εἰς ἐξόδους δυνάμεων δυνατῶν αὐτοῦ, καὶ διατάξεις
5 τῶν πεζῶν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐποίησε πόλεμον ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις ὁ βασιλεὺς Ναβουχοδονόσορ πρὸς βασιλέα Ἀρφαξὰδ ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ τῷ
6 μεγάλῳ, τοῦτ᾿ ἔστιν πεδίον ἐν τοῖς ὁρίοις Ῥαγαῦ. Καὶ συνήντησαν πρὸς αὐτὸν πάντες οἱ κατοικοῦντες τὴν ὀρεινὴν, καὶ πάντες οἱ κατοικοῦντες τὸν Εὐφράτην, καὶ τὸν Τίγριν, καὶ τὸν Ὑδάσπην, καὶ πεδία Ἀριὼχ ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἐλιμαίων. καὶ συνῆλθαν ἔθνη πολλὰ σφόδρα εἰς παράταξιν υἱῶν Χελεούδ.
7 Καὶ ἀπέστειλε Ναβουχοδονόσορ βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων ἐπὶ πάντας τοὺς κατοικοῦντας Περσίδα, καὶ ἐπὶ πάντας τοὺς κατοικοῦντας πρὸς δυσμὰς, τοὺς κατοικοῦντας Κιλικίαν καὶ Δαμασκὸν, καὶ Λίβανον καὶ Ἀντιλίβανον, καὶ πάντας τοὺς κατοικοῦντας κατὰ πρόσωπον τῆς παραλίας,

#### CHAPTER 1

1 In the twelfth year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, who was king over the Assyrians in Nineveh, the great city—
2 In the days of Arphaxad, who was king over the Medes in Ecbatana, and built about Ecbatana walls made of hewn stones, [each block measuring] three cubits in width, and six cubits in length; and he made the height of the wall seventy cubits, and its breadth
3 fifty cubits. And he set its towers upon the gates thereof, [to be] an hundred cubits [high], and the breadth thereof he founded
4 unto sixty cubits. And he made the gates thereof, [even] gates [that might be] lifted up unto the height of seventy cubits, and the breadth of them forty cubits, for the going forth of his mighty armies, and for the marshalling of his footmen.
5 And in those days did King Nebuchadnezzar make war with King Arphaxad in the great plain,
6 even the plain in the borders of Ragau. And there met him all they that dwelt in the mountainous region, and all they that dwelt by the Euphrates, and the Tigris, and the Hydaspes, and the plains of Arioch, the king of the Elymaeans. And many nations, exceeding mighty, assembled for the battle of the sons of Cheleoud.
7 And Nebuchadnezzar, the king of the Assyrians, sent forth [messengers] unto all them that dwelt in Persia, and unto all them that dwelt toward the west, [even] them that inhabited Cilicia and Damascus, and Lebanon and Antilebanon, and all them that dwelt by the seacoast,
