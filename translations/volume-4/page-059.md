32 τὸν, κολακεύει αὐτήν, ὅπως διαλλαγὴ αὐτῷ. Ὦ ἄνδρες, πῶς οὐχὶ
33 ἰσχυραὶ αἱ γυναῖκες, ὅτι οὕτως πράσσουσι; Καὶ τότε ὁ βασιλεὺς
καὶ οἱ μεγιστᾶνες ἐνέβλεπον ἕτερος πρὸς τὸν ἕτερον, καὶ ἤρξαντο
34 λαλεῖν περὶ τῆς ἀληθείας. Ἄνδρες, οὐχ ἰσχυραὶ αἱ γυναῖκες; με-
γάλη ἡ γῆ, καὶ ὑψηλὸς ὁ οὐρανός, καὶ ταχὺς τῷ δρόμῳ ὁ ἥλιος,
ὅτι στρέφεται ἐν τῷ κύκλῳ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ πάλιν ἀποτρέχει εἰς
35 τὸν ἑαυτοῦ τόπον ἐν μιᾷ ἡμέρᾳ. Οὐχὶ μέγας ὃς ταῦτα ποιεῖ; καὶ
36 ἡ ἀλήθεια μεγάλη καὶ ἰσχυροτέρα παρὰ πάντα. Πᾶσα ἡ γῆ τὴν
ἀλήθειαν καλεῖ, καὶ ὁ οὐρανὸς αὐτὴν εὐλογεῖ, καὶ πάντα τὰ ἔργα
37 σείεται καὶ τρέμει, καὶ οὐκ ἔστι μετ᾽ αὐτῆς ἄδικον οὐδέν. Ἄ-
δικος ὁ οἶνος, ἄδικος ὁ βασιλεύς, ἄδικοι αἱ γυναῖκες, ἄδικοι πάν-
τες οἱ υἱοὶ τῶν ἀνθρώπων, καὶ ἄδικα πάντα τὰ ἔργα αὐτῶν πάν-
τα τὰ τοιαῦτα, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν αὐτοῖς ἀλήθεια, καὶ ἐν τῇ ἀδι-
38 κίᾳ ἑαυτῶν ἀπολοῦνται. Ἡ δὲ ἀλήθεια μένει καὶ ἰσχύει εἰς τὸν
39 αἰῶνα, καὶ ζῇ καὶ κρατεῖ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τοῦ αἰῶνος. Καὶ οὐκ ἔστι
παρ᾽ αὐτῇ λαμβάνειν πρόσωπα, οὐδὲ διάφορα, ἀλλὰ τὰ δίκαια
ποιεῖ, ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν ἀδίκων καὶ πονηρῶν ἀπέχεται· καὶ πάν-
40 τες εὐδοκοῦσι τοῖς ἔργοις αὐτῆς. Καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν τῇ κρίσει αὐ-
τῆς οὐδὲν ἄδικον· καὶ αὕτη, ἡ ἰσχύς, καὶ τὸ βασίλειον, καὶ ἡ ἐ-
ξουσία, καὶ ἡ μεγαλειότης τῶν πάντων αἰώνων. εὐλογητὸς ὁ Θε-
41 ὸς τῆς ἀληθείας. Καὶ ἐσιώπησε τοῦ λαλεῖν. καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς τό-
τε ἐφώνησε· καὶ τότε εἶπε· μεγάλη ἡ ἀλήθεια, καὶ ὑπερισχύει.
42 Τότε ὁ βασιλεὺς εἶπεν αὐτῷ· αἴτησαι ὃ θέλεις, πλείω τῶν γεγραμ-
μένων, καὶ δώσομέν σοι, ἀφ᾽ ὧν εὑρέθης σοφώτερος, καὶ ἐχόμενός
μου καθήσῃ, καὶ συγγενής μου κληθήσῃ.
43 Τότε εἶπε τῷ βασιλεῖ· μνήσθητι τὴν εὐχήν, ἣν ηὔξω, οἰκοδομῆσαι τὴν Ἱερουσα-
44 λὴμ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ᾗ τὸ βασίλειόν σου παρέλαβες, καὶ πάντα τὰ
σκεύη τὰ ληφθέντα ἐξ Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐκπέμψαι, ἃ ἐξεχώρησε Κῦ-
ρος, ὅτε ηὔξατο ἐκκόψαι Βαβυλῶνα, καὶ ηὔξατο ἐξαποστεῖλαι ἐ-
44 κεῖ. Καὶ σὺ ηὔξω οἰκοδομῆσαι τὸν ναὸν ὃν ἐνεπύρισαν οἱ Ἰδου-
46 μαῖοι, ὅτε ἠρημώθη ἡ Ἰουδαία ὑπὸ τῶν Χαλδαίων. Καὶ νῦν τοῦ-
τό ἐστιν ὃ σὲ ἀξιῶ, κύριε βασιλεῦ, καὶ ὃ αἰτοῦμαί σε, καὶ αὕ-
τη ἐστι μεγαλωσύνη ἡ παρὰ σοῦ. δέομαι οὖν ἵνα ποιήσῃς τὴν
εὐχήν, ἣν ηὔξω τῷ βασιλεῖ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, ποιῆσαι ἐκ στόματός
47 σου. Τότε ἀναστὰς Δαρεῖος ὁ βασιλεὺς κατεφίλησεν αὐτόν, καὶ
ἔγραψεν αὐτῷ τὰς ἐπιστολὰς πρὸς πάντας τοὺς οἰκονόμους, καὶ

**Chapter IV.** (continued)

**32** him, he doth flatter her, that there might be reconciliation unto him. O men, how are not women mighty, that they perform such deeds?
**33** And then the king and the magnates looked one unto another, and began to speak concerning the truth.
**34** "Men, are not women mighty? Great is the earth, and high is the heaven, and swift in its course is the sun, for it turneth in the circuit of the heaven, and again returneth unto its own place in one day.
**35** Is not he great who doth perform these things? Yea, the truth is great and mightier than all [else].
**36** All the earth doth call upon the truth, and the heaven doth bless it; and all works do quake and tremble, and there is naught unrighteous with it.
**37** Unrighteous is wine, unrighteous is the king, unrighteous are women, unrighteous are all the sons of men; and unrighteous are all their works, yea, all such things; and there is no truth in them, and in their unrighteousness shall they perish.
**38** But the truth abideth and is mighty unto the age, and liveth and doth prevail unto the age of ages.
**39** And with it there is no respect of persons, nor any partiality; but it doth perform that which is righteous, and from all unrighteous and wicked things doth it keep itself; and all are well-pleased with its works.
**40** And in its judgment there is naught unrighteous; and this is the strength, and the kingdom, and the authority, and the majesty of all the ages. Blessed is the God of truth!"
**41** And he ceased from speaking. And all the people then cried out, and then said, "Great is the truth, and it doth prevail!"
**42** Then the king said unto him, "Ask whatsoever thou wilt, yea, more than that which hath been decreed, and we will give it unto thee, since thou art found wiser, and thou shalt sit next unto me, and thou shalt be called my kinsman."
**43** Then he said unto the king, "Remember the vow which thou didst vow, to build Jerusalem on the day wherein thou didst receive thy kingdom, and to send forth all the vessels taken from Jerusalem, which Cyrus did set apart, when he vowed to cut down Babylon, and vowed to send [them] forth thither.
**44** And thou didst vow to build the Temple, which the Idumaeans did burn, when Judea was laid waste by the Chaldeans.
**45** And now this is that which I deem worthy [to ask] of thee, O Lord King, and that which I entreat of thee; and this is the greatness that cometh from thee. I pray thee therefore, that thou perform the vow which thou didst vow unto the King of heaven, to perform [it] from thy mouth."
**46** Then King Darius arose, and kissed him; and he wrote unto him letters unto all the stewards, and
