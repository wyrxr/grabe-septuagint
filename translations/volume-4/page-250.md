**ΚΕΦ. ΙΕ΄. XV.**

**6.** Κακῶν ἐρασταί, καὶ οἱ σεβόμενοι.
**7.** Καὶ γὰρ κεραμεὺς ἀπαλὴν γῆν θλίβων ἐπίμοχθον, πλάσσει πρὸς ὑπηρεσίαν ἡμῶν ἕν ἕκαστον· ἀλλ᾿ ἐκ τοῦ αὐτοῦ πηλοῦ ἀνεπλάσατο τά τε τῶν καθαρῶν ἔργων δοῦλα σκεύη, τά τε ἐναντία πάντα ὁμοίως· τούτων δὲ ἑκατέρου τίς ἑκάστου ἐστὶν ἡ χρῆσις, κριτὴς ὁ πηλουργός·
**8.** καὶ κακόμοχθος θεὸν μάταιον πλάσσει ἐκ τοῦ αὐτοῦ πηλοῦ, ὃς πρὸ μικροῦ ἐκ γῆς γεννηθείς, μετ᾿ ὀλίγον πορεύεται ἐξ ἧς ἐλήφθη, τὸ τῆς ψυχῆς ἀπαιτηθεὶς χρέος.
**9.** Ἀλλ᾿ ἔστιν αὐτῷ φροντὶς οὐχ ὅτι μέλλει κάμνειν, οὐδ᾿ ὅτι βραχυτελῆ βίον ἔχει· ἀλλ᾿ ἀντερίζεται μὲν χρυσοργοῖς· καὶ ἀργυροχρόοις, χαλκοπλάστας τε μιμεῖται, καὶ δόξαν ἡγεῖται ὅτι κίβδηλα πλάσσει.
**10.** Σποδὸς ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ, καὶ γῆς εὐτελεστέρα ἡ ἐλπὶς αὐτοῦ, πηλοῦ τε ἀτιμότερος ὁ βίος αὐτοῦ.
**11.** Ὅτι ἠγνόησε τὸν ποιήσαντα αὐτόν, καὶ τὸν ἐμπνεύσαντα αὐτῷ ψυχὴν ἐνεργοῦσαν, καὶ ἐμφυσήσαντα πνεῦμα ζωτικόν.
**12.** Ἀλλὰ ἐλογίσαντο παίγνιον εἶναι τὴν ζωὴν ἡμῶν, καὶ τὸν βίον πανηγυρισμὸν ἐπικερδῆ· δεῖν γὰρ φάσιν ὅθεν δὴ καὶ ἐκ κακοῦ πορίζειν.
**13.** Οὗτος γὰρ παρὰ πάντας οἶδεν ὅτι ἁμαρτάνει, ἧς γεώδους εὐθραύστα σκεύη καὶ γλυπτὰ δημιουργῶν.
**14.** Πάντων δὲ ἀφρονέστατοι καὶ τάλανες ὑπὲρ ψυχῆς νηπίων, οἱ ἐχθροὶ τοῦ λαοῦ σου καταδυναστεύσαντες αὐτόν·
**15.** ὅτι πάντα τὰ εἴδωλα τῶν ἐθνῶν ἐλογίσαντο θεούς, οἷς οὔτε ὀμμάτων χρῆσις εἰς ὅρασιν, οὔτε ῥῖνες εἰς συνολκὴν ἀέρος, οὔτε ὦτα ἀκούειν, οὔτε δάκτυλοι χειρῶν εἰς ψηλάφησιν, καὶ οἱ πόδες αὐτῶν ἀργοὶ πρὸς ἐπίβασιν.
**16.** Ἄνθρωπος γὰρ ἐποίησεν αὐτούς, καὶ τὸ πνεῦμα δεδανεισμένος ἔπλασεν αὐτούς· οὐδεὶς γὰρ ἀνθρώπων ὅμοιον ἰσχύει πλάσαι θεόν· θνητὸς δὲ ὢν νεκρὸν ἐργάζεται χερσὶν ἀνόμοις·
**17.** κρείσσων γὰρ ἐστιν τῶν σεβασμάτων αὐτοῦ· ὧν οὗτος μὲν ἔζησεν, ἐκεῖνα δὲ οὐδέποτε.
**18.** Καὶ τὰ ζῶα δὲ τὰ ἔχθιστα σέβονται· ἔνια γὰρ συγκρινόμενα τῶν ἄλλων ἐστὶ χείρονα,
**19.** οὐδ᾿ ὅσον ἐπιποθῆσαι ὡς ἐν ζώων ὄψει καλὰ τυγχάνει, ἐκπέφευγε δὲ καὶ τὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ ἔπαινον καὶ τὴν εὐλογίαν αὐτοῦ.

**ΚΕΦ. ΙΣΤ΄. XVI.**

**1.** ΔΙΑ τοῦτο δι᾿ ὁμοίων ἐκολάσθησαν ἀξίως, καὶ διὰ πλήθους κνωδάλων ἐβασανίσθησαν.
**2.** Ἀνθ᾿ ἧς κολάσεως εὐεργέτησας τὸν λαόν σου εἰς ἐπιθυμίαν ὀρέξεως ξένην γεῦσιν, τροφὴν ἠτίμασας ὀρυγομήτραν·
**3.** ἵνα ἐκεῖνοι μὲν ἐπιθυμοῦντες τροφήν, διὰ τὴν εἰδεχθείαν τῶν ἐπαπεσταλμένων καὶ τὴν ἀναγκαίαν ὄρεξιν ἀποστρέφωνται,
**4.** οὗτοι δὲ ἐπ᾿ ὀλίγον ἐνδεεῖς γενόμενοι, καὶ ξένης μετάσχωσι γεύσεως.
**5.** Ἔδει γὰρ ἐκείνοις μὲν ἀπαραίτητον ἔνδειαν ἐπελθεῖν τυραννοῦσι, τούτοις δὲ μόνον δειχθῆναι πῶς οἱ ἐχθροὶ αὐτῶν ἐβασανίζοντο.
**6.** Καὶ γὰρ ὅτε αὐτοῖς δεινὸς ἐπῆλθε θηρίων θυμός, δήγμασί τε σκολιῶν διεφθείροντο ὄφεων, οὐ μέχρι τέλους ἔμεινεν ἡ ὀργή σου· εἰς νουθεσίαν δὲ πρὸς ὀλίγον ἐταράχθησαν, σύμβολον ἔχοντες σωτηρίας, εἰς ἀνάμνησιν ἐντολῆς νόμου σου·
**7.** ὁ γὰρ ἐπιστραφεὶς οὐ διὰ τὸ θεωρούμενον ἐσώζετο,
**8.** ἀλλὰ διὰ σὲ τὸν πάντων σωτῆρα.
**9.** Καὶ ἐν τούτῳ δὲ ἔπεισας τοὺς ἐχθροὺς ἡμῶν, ὅτι σὺ εἶ ὁ ῥυόμενος ἐκ παντὸς κακοῦ· οὓς μὲν γὰρ ἀκρίδων καὶ μυιῶν ἀπέκτεινε δείγματα, καὶ οὐχ εὑρέθη ἴαμα τῇ ψυχῇ αὐτῶν,
**10.** ἔτι ἄξιοι ἦσαν ὑπὸ τοιούτων κολασθῆναι· Τοὺς δὲ υἱούς σου οὐδὲ ἰοβόλων δρακόντων ἐνίκησαν ὀδόντες·
**11.** τὸ ἔλεος γάρ σου ἀντιπαρῆλθε, καὶ ἐξ ἰάσεως διεσώζοντο, ἵνα μὴ εἰς βαθεῖαν ἐμπεσόντες λήθην, ἀπερίσπαστοι γένωνται τῆς σῆς εὐεργεσίας.
**12.** Καὶ γὰρ οὔτε βοτάνη οὔτε μάλαγμα ἐθεράπευσεν αὐτούς,
**13.** ἀλλὰ ὁ σὸς Κύριε λόγος ὁ πάντα ἰώμενος. Σὺ γὰρ ζωῆς καὶ θανάτου ἐξουσίαν ἔχεις, καὶ κατάγεις εἰς πύλας ᾅδου,
**14.** καὶ ἀνάγεις. Ἄνθρωπος δὲ ἀποκτείνει μὲν τῇ κακίᾳ αὐτοῦ· ἐξελθὸν δὲ πνεῦμα οὐκ ἀναστρέφει, οὐδὲ ἀναλύει ψυχὴν παραληφθεῖσαν.
**15.** Τὴν δὲ σὴν χεῖρα φυγεῖν ἀδύνατον ἐστιν· ἀρνούμενοι γάρ σε εἰδέναι ἀσεβεῖς, ἐν ἰσχύϊ βραχίονός σου ἐμαστιγώθησαν,
**16.** ξένοις ὕετοις καὶ χαλάζαις καὶ ὄμβροις διωκόμενοι ἀπαραιτήτοις, καὶ πυρὶ καταναλισκόμενοι.
**17.** Τὸ γὰρ παραδοξότατον, ἐν τῷ πάντα σβεννύντι ὕδατι πλεῖον ἐνήργει τὸ πῦρ· (ὑπέρμαχος γὰρ ὁ κόσμος ἐστιν δικαίων)·
**18.** ποτὲ μὲν γὰρ ἡμεροῦτο φλόξ, ἵνα μὴ καταφλέξῃ τὰ ἐπ᾿ ἀσεβεῖς ἀπεσταλμένα ζῶα, ἀλλὰ αὐτοὶ βλέποντες ἴδωσιν, ὅτι Θεοῦ κρίσει ἐλαύνονται·
**19.** ποτὲ δὲ καὶ μεταξὺ ὕδατος ὑπὲρ τὴν πυρὸς δύναμιν φλέγει, ἵνα ἀδίκου γῆς γεννήματα καταφθείρῃ.
**20.** Ἀνθ᾿ ὧν ἀγγέλων τροφὴν ἔθρεψας τὸν λαόν σου, καὶ ἕτοιμον ἄρτον ἀπ᾿ οὐρανοῦ παρέσχες αὐτοῖς ἀκοπιάστως, πᾶσαν ἡδονὴν ἴσχοντα καὶ πρὸς πᾶσαν ἁρμόνιον γεῦσιν.
**21.** Ἡ μὲν γὰρ ἀπόστασίς σου

**CHAPTER XV.**

**6** ...lovers of evil are they, and those who worship [them].
**7** For even a potter, pressing soft earth with toil, doth fashion each thing for our service; but out of the same clay did he mould both vessels for clean works, which are servants, and all the contrary [vessels] likewise; and of these two, what the use of each is, the potter himself is the judge.
**8** And a worker of evil doth fashion a vain god from the same clay; who, being born of the earth but a little while ago, after a short time goeth forth from whence he was taken, when the debt of his soul is demanded.
**9** But he hath no care that he is about to toil, nor that he possesseth a short-lived life; but he contendeth with goldsmiths, and with those who cast in silver, and doth imitate coppersmiths, and accounteth it glory that he doth fashion counterfeit things.
**10** Ashes is his heart, and cheaper than earth is his hope, and more dishonorable than clay is his life.
**11** For he ignored Him who made him, and Him who breathed into him an active soul, and who breathed in a life-giving spirit.
**12** But they accounted our life to be a mere sport, and our livelihood a gainful festival; for they say that one ought to procure [wealth], whence indeed, even from evil.
**13** For this one, beyond all others, knoweth that he sinneth, fashioning fragile vessels and graven images from that which is earthly.
**14** But most foolish of all, and more wretched than the soul of infants, are the enemies of Thy people who did oppress it.
**15** For they accounted all the idols of the nations as gods, to whom there is neither the use of eyes for seeing, nor nostrils for the drawing in of air, nor ears for hearing, nor fingers of hands for touching, and their feet are idle for stepping forth.
**16** For a man did make them, and having borrowed breath, he did fashion them; for no one among men is able to fashion a god like [himself]; and being mortal, he doth fashion a dead thing with hands unlike [life];
**17** for he is superior to his objects of worship, of which he indeed liveth, but those [idols] never did.
**18** And they worship even the most hateful beasts; for some, when compared, are worse than the others,
**19** nor do they prove to be so beautiful as to be desired in the sight of beasts, but have escaped both the praise of God and His blessing.

**CHAPTER XVI.**

**1** For this cause, by like things were they justly punished, and by a multitude of wild beasts were they tormented.
**2** Instead of which punishment Thou didst bless Thy people, giving unto them for a desire of appetite a strange taste, and didst dishonor the food of the locusts;
**3** that those, desiring food, might turn away from it because of the repulsiveness of the [plague] sent unto them and [even from] their necessary appetite,
**4** but these, having become needy for a little while, might also partake of a strange taste.
**5** For it was meet for those, being tyrants, to be overtaken by unavoidable destitution; but for these, only to be shown how their enemies were tormented.
**6** For when a terrible fury of beasts came upon them, and they were destroyed by the bites of crooked serpents, Thy wrath remained not unto the end; but for a little while were they troubled for admonition, having a symbol of salvation, for a remembrance of the commandment of Thy law.
**7** For he who turned was saved not by that which was seen,
**8** but by Thee, the Savior of all. And by this didst Thou persuade our enemies, that Thou art He who delivereth from every evil.
**9** For those whom the stings of locusts and flies did kill, and no healing was found for their soul,
**10** were yet worthy to be punished by such things. But Thy sons did not the teeth even of venomous dragons overcome;
**11** for Thy mercy passed over [them], and from healing were they preserved, lest, having fallen into deep forgetfulness, they should be drawn away from Thy beneficence.
**12** For neither herb nor poultice did heal them,
**13** but Thy word, O Lord, which healeth all things. For Thou hast power of life and death, and Thou leadest down to the gates of Hades,
**14** and Thou bringest up. But man indeed doth slay by his wickedness; yet a spirit, having departed, doth not return, nor doth it release a soul that hath been taken.
**15** But to flee Thy hand is impossible; for the impious, denying to know Thee, were scourged by the strength of Thine arm,
**16** being pursued by strange rains and hailstones and irresistible storms, and consumed by fire.
**17** For, most paradoxical, in the water which doth extinguish all things, the fire did work more powerfully; (for the world is a champion for the righteous).
**18** For sometimes was the flame made mild, that it might not burn up the living creatures sent against the impious, but that they themselves, beholding, might perceive that by God's judgment they are driven.
**19** But sometimes also, amidst the water, it doth burn with power beyond [that of] fire, that it might destroy the offspring of the unrighteous earth.
**20** Instead of which [punishments], Thou didst nourish Thy people with the food of angels, and didst provide them ready bread from heaven without toil, having every pleasure and suitable for every taste.
**21** For indeed Thy departure [from them...]
