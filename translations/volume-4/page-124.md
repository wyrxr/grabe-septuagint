**ΚΕΦ. ΙΓ΄. ΜΑΚΚΑΒΑΙΩΝ Α΄.**

**14** ἀνέστῃ Σίμων ἀντὶ Ἰωνάθου τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὅτι συνάπτειν
    αὐτῷ μέλλει εἰς πόλεμον, καὶ ἀπέστειλε πρὸς αὐτὸν πρέσβεις,
**15** λέγων. Περὶ ἀργυρίου οὗ ὤφειλεν Ἰωνάθαν ὁ ἀδελφός σου εἰς τὸ
    βασιλικόν, δι᾿ ἃς εἶχε χρείας, συνέχομεν αὐτόν.
**16** Καὶ νῦν ἀπόστειλον ἀργυρίου ἑκατὸν τάλαντα καὶ δύο τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ ὄμηρα,
    ὅπως μὴ ἀφεθεὶς ἀποστατήσῃ ἀφ᾿ ἡμῶν, καὶ ἀφήσομεν αὐτόν.
**17** Καὶ ἔγνω Σίμων ὅτι δόλῳ λαλοῦσι πρὸς αὐτόν, καὶ πέμπει τὸ ἀργύριον καὶ τὰ παιδάρια, καὶ μήποτε ἔχθραν ἄρῃ μεγάλην πρὸς τὸν
**18** λαόν, λέγων· ὅτι οὐκ ἀπέστειλα αὐτῷ τὸ ἀργύριον καὶ τὰ παιδάρια, ἀπώλετο.
**19** Καὶ ἀπέστειλε τὰ παιδάρια καὶ τὰ ἑκατὸν τάλαντα, καὶ διεψεύσατο, καὶ οὐκ ἀφῆκε τὸν Ἰωνάθαν.
**20** Καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα ἦλθε Τρύφων τοῦ ἐμβατεύσαι εἰς τὴν χώραν, καὶ ἐκτρῖψαι αὐτήν, καὶ ἐκύκλωσεν ὁδὸν τὴν εἰς Ἄδωρα· καὶ Σίμων καὶ
    ἡ παρεμβολὴ αὐτοῦ ἀντιπαρήγεν αὐτῷ εἰς πάντα τόπον οὗ ἂν
    ἐπορεύετο.
**21** Οἱ δὲ ἐκ τῆς ἄκρας ἀπέστελλον πρὸς Τρύφωνα πρεσβευτὰς καὶ κατασπεύδοντας αὐτὸν τοῦ ἐλθεῖν πρὸς αὐτοὺς διὰ τῆς ἐρήμου, καὶ ἀποστεῖλαι αὐτοῖς τροφάς.
**22** Καὶ ἡτοίμασε Τρύφων πᾶσαν τὴν ἵππον αὐτοῦ ἐλθεῖν· καὶ ἐν τῇ νυκτὶ ἐκείνῃ ἦν χιὼν πολλὴ σφόδρα, καὶ οὐκ ἦλθε διὰ τὴν χιόνα· καὶ ἀπῆρε καὶ ἦλθεν εἰς τὴν Γαλααδίτιν.
**23** Ὡς δὲ ἤγγισε τῇ Βασκαμᾷ, ἀπέκτεινε τὸν Ἰωνάθαν καὶ ἐτάφη ἐκεῖ.
**24** Καὶ ἐπέστρεψε Τρύφων καὶ ἀπῆλθεν εἰς τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ.
**25** Καὶ ἀπέστειλε Σίμων, καὶ ἔλαβε τὰ ὀστᾶ Ἰωνάθαν τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὰ ἐν Μωδεεὶμ πόλει τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ.
**26** Καὶ ἐκόψαντο αὐτὸν πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ κοπετὸν μέγαν, καὶ ἐπένθησαν αὐτὸν ἡμέρας πολλὰς.
**27** Καὶ ᾠκοδόμησε Σίμων ἐπὶ τὸν τάφον τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὕψωσεν αὐτὸν τῇ ὁράσει λίθῳ ξυστῷ ἐκ τῶν
    ὄπισθεν καὶ ἐκ τῶν ἔμπροσθεν.
**28** Καὶ ἔστησεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὰ ἑπτὰ πυραμίδας, μίαν κατέναντι τῆς μιᾶς τῷ πατρὶ καὶ τῇ μητρὶ καὶ τοῖς τέσσαρσιν ἀδελφοῖς.
**29** Καὶ ταύταις ἐποίησε μηχανήματα περιθεὶς στύλους μεγάλους, καὶ ἐποίησεν ἐπὶ τοῖς στύλοις πανοπλίας εἰς ὄνομα αἰώνιον, καὶ παρὰ ταῖς πανοπλίαις πλοῖα ἐπιγεγλυμμένα εἰς τὸ θεωρεῖσθαι ὑπὸ πάντων τῶν πλεόντων τὴν θάλασσαν.
**30** Οὗτος ὁ τάφος ὃν ἐποίησεν ἐν Μωδεὶμ, ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης.
**31** Ὁ δὲ Τρύφων ἐπορεύετο δόλῳ μετὰ Ἀντιόχου τοῦ βασιλέως τοῦ νεωτέρου,
**32** καὶ ἀπέκτεινεν αὐτὸν, καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ περιέθετο τὸ διάδημα τῆς Ἀσίας, καὶ ἐποίησε πληγὴν μεγάλην ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς.

**13:14** [up against him], Simon was risen in the stead of Jonathan his brother, and that he purposed to join battle with him; and he sent ambassadors unto him, saying:
**13:15** "Concerning the silver which Jonathan thy brother owed unto the royal treasury, for those needs which he had, do we hold him.
**13:16** And now send a hundred talents of silver and two of his sons for hostages, that he, being released, may not revolt from us; and then will we let him go."
**13:17** And Simon knew that they spake unto him with guile; yet sent he the silver and the young lads, lest peradventure he should bring great enmity upon the people, saying [within himself]:
**13:18** "If I send not unto him the silver and the young lads, he shall perish."
**13:19** And so he sent the young lads and the hundred talents; yet Tryphon dealt falsely, and released not Jonathan.
**13:20** And after these things, Tryphon came to invade the country, and to waste it utterly. And he marched by the way that leadeth to Adora; and Simon and his host marched against him in every place whither he went.
**13:21** Now they that were in the citadel sent ambassadors unto Tryphon, and hasted him to come unto them through the desert, and to send them provisions.
**13:22** And Tryphon prepared all his cavalry to come; yet in that night there was a great snow, insomuch that he came not because of the snow. So he departed thence, and came into the land of Galaad.
**13:23** And when he drew nigh to Bascama, he slew Jonathan; and he was buried there.
**13:24** And Tryphon returned, and departed into his own land.
**13:25** Then Simon sent, and took the bones of Jonathan his brother; and they buried them in Modein, the city of his fathers.
**13:26** And all Israel bewailed him with a great lamentation, and mourned for him many days.
**13:27** Moreover, Simon built a monument upon the sepulchre of his father and his brethren, and raised it exceeding high to the sight with dressed stone, both behind and before.
**13:28** And upon them he set seven pyramids, one over against the other: for his father, and for his mother, and for his four brethren.
**13:29** And for these he wrought cunning devices, having placed great pillars round about them; and upon the pillars he made panoplies, for an everlasting memorial, and by the panoplies were ships graven, that they might be seen by all that sail the sea.
**13:30** This is the sepulchre which he made in Modein, [and it standeth] even unto this day.
**13:31** Now Tryphon dealt deceitfully with Antiochus the younger king, and slew him;
**13:32** and he reigned in his stead, and put on the diadem of Asia, and wrought great destruction upon the land.
