μὴ ἐκδίκησιν ἐχθρῶν. Οὐκ ἔστι κεφαλὴ ὑπὲρ κεφαλὴν ὄφεως, καὶ                                15
οὐκ ἔστι θυμὸς ὑπὲρ θυμὸν ἐχθροῦ. Συνοικῆσαι λέοντι καὶ δρά-                                16
κοντι εὐδοκήσῃ, ἢ συνοικήσαι μετὰ γυναικὸς πονηρᾶς. Πονηρία                                17
γυναικὸς ἀλλοιοῖ τὴν ὄρασιν αὐτῆς, καὶ σκοτοῖ τὸ πρόσωπον αὐ-                                18
τῆς ὡς ἄρκος· ἀναμέσον τοῦ πλησίον αὐτοῦ ἀναπεσεῖται ὁ ἀνὴρ                                 18
αὐτῆς, καὶ ἀκούσας ἀνεστέναξε πικρά. Μικρὰ πᾶσα κακία πρὸς                                  19
κακίαν γυναικός· κλῆρος ἁμαρτωλοῦ ἐπιπέσοι αὐτῇ. Ἀνάβασις                                  20
ἀμμώδης ἐν ποσὶ πρεσβυτέρου, οὕτως γυνὴ γλωσσώδης ἀνδρὶ ἡσύ-                                  21

μὴ ἐπιποθήσῃς. Ὀργὴ καὶ ἀναίδεια καὶ αἰσχύνη μεγάλη γυνὴ,                                  22
ἐὰν ἐπιχορηγῇ τῷ ἀνδρὶ αὐτῆς. Καρδία ταπεινὴ καὶ πρόσωπον                                  23
σκυθρωπὸν καὶ πληγὴ καρδίας γυνὴ πονηρά· χεῖρες παρειμέναι                                   23
καὶ γόνατα παραλελυμένα, ἥτις οὐ μακαριεῖ τὸν ἄνδρα αὐτῆς. Ἀπὸ                                24
γυναικὸς ἀρχὴ ἁμαρτίας, καὶ δι᾿ αὐτὴν ἀποθνήσκομεν πάντες.                                  24
Μὴ δῷς ὕδατι διέξοδον, μηδὲ γυναικὶ πονηρᾷ παῤῥησίαν ἐξόδου·                                 25
εἰ μὴ πορεύεται κατὰ χεῖρά σου, ἀπὸ τῶν σαρκῶν σου ἀπότεμε                                 26
αὐτήν· δίδου, καὶ ἀπόλυσον.                                                                  26

ΚΕΦ. ΚϚ΄. XXVI.

ΓΥΝΑΙΚΟΣ ἀγαθῆς μακάριος ὁ ἀνὴρ, καὶ ὁ ἀριθμὸς τῶν 1
ἡμερῶν αὐτοῦ διπλάσιος. Γυνὴ ἀνδρεῖα εὐφραίνει τὸν ἄνδρα αὐ- 2
τῆς, καὶ τὰ ἔτη αὐτοῦ πληρώσει ἐν εἰρήνῃ. Γυνὴ ἀγαθὴ μερὶς 3
ἀγαθὴ ἐν μερίδι φοβουμένων τὸν Κύριον δοθήσεται. Πλουσίου 4
δὲ καὶ πτωχοῦ καρδία ἀγαθὴ πρὸς Κύριον, ἐν παντὶ καιρῷ πρό- 5
σωπον ἱλαρὸν ἔχοντες γαυριάσουσιν. Ἀπὸ τριῶν ηὐλαβήθη καρ- 5
δία μου, καὶ ἐπὶ τῷ τετάρτῳ προσώπῳ ἐδεήθην· διαβολὴν πό- 6
λεως, καὶ ἐκκλησίαν ὄχλου, καὶ καταψευσμόν, ὑπὲρ θάνατον 6
πάντα μοχθηρά· ἄλγος καρδίας καὶ πένθος γυνὴ ἀντίζηλος ἐπὶ 7
γυναικί· καὶ μάστιξ γλώσσης πᾶσιν ἐπικοινωνοῦσα. Βοοζύ- 7
γον σαλευόμενον γυνὴ πονηρά· ὁ κρατῶν αὐτῆς ὡς δρασσόμενος 8
σκορπίου. Ὀργὴ μεγάλη γυνὴ μέθυσος καὶ ῥεμβάς· καὶ ἀσχημο- 8
σύνην αὐτῆς οὐ μὴ συγκαλύψει. Πορνεία γυναικὸς ἐν μετεωρισμῷ 9
ὀφθαλμῶν, καὶ ἐν τοῖς βλεφάροις αὐτῆς γνωσθήσεται. Ἐπὶ θυγα- 10
τρὶ ἀδιατρέπτῳ στερέωσον φυλακὴν, ἵνα μὴ εὑροῦσα ἄνεσιν ἑαυτῇ, 10
χρήσηται· ὀπίσω ἀναιδοῦς ὀφθαλμοῦ φύλαξαι, καὶ μὴ θαυμάσῃς 11

…[and every vengeance, but] not the vengeance of enemies.
15 There is no head above the head of a serpent,
nor is there wrath above the wrath of an enemy.
16 Thou shalt be content to dwell with a lion and a dragon,
rather than to dwell with a wicked woman.
17 The wickedness of a woman doth alter her countenance,
18 and darken her face as [the] bear.
Her husband shall recline amongst his neighbor,
and hearing [of her deeds], he groaned bitterly.
19 All wickedness is small beside the wickedness of a woman;
may the lot of a sinner fall upon her!
20 A sandy ascent beneath the feet of an old man
is such a talkative woman to a quiet man.
21 Be not entangled by the beauty of a woman,
neither desire a woman for her comeliness.
22 Great wrath and shamelessness and scandal is a woman,
if she bestows [these] upon her husband.
23 A humble heart and a gloomy countenance,
and a wound of the heart is a wicked woman;
listless hands and paralyzed knees
[hath she] who shall not call her husband blessed.
24 From a woman began sin,
and through her do we all die.
25 Give not an outlet to water,
neither to a wicked woman give freedom to go out.
26 If she walk not according to thy hand,
cut her off from thy flesh;
divorce [her], and let her go.

**Chapter Twenty-Six**

1 Blessed is the man of a good wife,
and the number of his days shall be doubled.
2 A virtuous woman doth gladden her husband,
and she shall fill his years with peace.
3 A good wife is a good portion;
she shall be given in the portion of them that fear the Lord.
4 The good heart of both rich and poor towards the Lord,
[these] shall rejoice, ever having a cheerful countenance.
5 From three things was my heart wary,
and for the fourth thing did I make supplication:
6 The slander of a city, and the congregation of a multitude,
and calumny; all these are more wicked than death.
7 A grief of heart and mourning is a rival wife unto [another] wife,
and a scourge of the tongue that doth communicate with all.
8 A shaky ox-yoke is a wicked woman;
he that holdeth her is as one grasping a scorpion.
9 Great wrath is a drunken and wayward woman;
and her indecency shall she not cover up.
10 The harlotry of a woman shall be known
by the haughty lifting of her eyes, and in her eyelids.
11 For a chaste daughter, establish a firm guard,
lest she, finding ease for herself, should misuse it.
Guard her from a shameless eye, and marvel not…
