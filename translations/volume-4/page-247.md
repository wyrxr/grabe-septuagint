**1.** ΜΑΤΑΙΟΙ μὲν γὰρ πάντες ἄνθρωποι φύσει, οἷς παρῆν
    Θεοῦ ἀγνωσία, καὶ ἐκ τῶν ὁρωμένων ἀγαθῶν οὐκ ἴσχυσαν εἰδέναι
**2.** τὸν ὄντα, οὔτε τοῖς ἔργοις προσέχοντες ἐπέγνωσαν τὸν τεχνίτην·
    ἀλλ᾿ ἢ πῦρ, ἢ πνεῦμα, ἢ ταχινὸν ἀέρα, ἢ κύκλον ἄστρων,
    ἢ βίαιον ὕδωρ, ἢ φωστῆρας οὐρανοῦ, πρυτάνεις κόσμου θεοὺς ἐνό-
**3.** μισαν· ὧν εἰ μὲν τῇ καλλονῇ τερπόμενοι, ταῦτα θεοὺς ὑπελάμ-
    βανον, γνώτωσαν πόσῳ τούτων ὁ δεσπότης ἐστὶ βελτίων· ὁ γὰρ
    τοῦ κάλλους γενεσιάρχης ἔκτισεν αὐτά.
**4.** Εἰ δὲ δύναμιν καὶ ἐνέργειαν ἐκπλαγέντες, νοησάτωσαν ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν πόσῳ ὁ κατασκευά-

    σμάτων ἀναλόγως ὁ γενεσιουργὸς αὐτῶν θεωρεῖται.
**6.** ᾿Αλλ᾿ ὅμως ἐπὶ τούτοις μέμψις ἐστιν ἐλίγη, καὶ γὰρ αὐτοὶ τάχα πλανῶνται
    Θεὸν ζητοῦντες καὶ θέλοντες εὑρεῖν·
**7.** ἐν γὰρ τοῖς ἔργοις αὐτοῦ ἀναστρεφόμενοι διερευνῶσι, καὶ πείθονται τῇ ὄψει, ὅτι καλὰ τὰ
**8.** βλεπόμενα. (Πάλιν δὲ οὐδὲ αὐτοὶ συγγνωστοί· εἰ γὰρ τοσοῦ-

**10.** τούτων δεσπότην πῶς τάχιον οὐχ εὗρον;) Ταλαίπωροι δὲ καὶ ἐν
    νεκροῖς αἱ ἐλπίδες αὐτῶν, οἵ τινες ἐκάλεσαν θεοὺς ἔργα χειρῶν
    ἀνθρώπων, χρυσῦν καὶ ἄργυρον τέχνης ἐμμελέτημα, καὶ ἀπεικά-
**11.** σματα ζώων, ἢ λίθον ἄχρηστον χειρὸς ἔργον ἀρχαίας.
**12.** Εἰ δὲ καὶ τις ὑλοτόμος τέκτων εὐκίνητον φυτὸν ἐκπρίσας, περιέξυσεν εὐ-
    μαθῶς πάντα τὸν φλοιὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τεχνησάμενος εὐπρεπῶς κα-
    τεσκεύασε χρήσιμον σκεῦος εἰς ὑπηρεσίαν ζωῆς,
**13.** τὰ δὲ ὑπολείμματα τῆς ἐργασίας εἰς ἑτοιμασίαν τροφῆς ἀναλώσας ἐνεπλήσθη·
    τὸ δὲ ἐξ αὐτῶν ἀπόβλημα εἰς οὐδὲν εὔχρηστον, ξύλον σκολιὸν καὶ
    ὄζοις συμπεφυκός, λαβὼν ἐγλυψεν ἐν ἐπιμελείᾳ ἐργασίας αὐτοῦ,
**14.** καὶ ἐμπειρίᾳ συνέσεως ἐτύπωσεν αὐτό, ἀπείκασε τε αὐτὸ εἰκόνι
    ἀνθρώπου,
**15.** ἢ ζώῳ τινὶ εὐτελεῖ ὡμοίωσεν αὐτῷ, καταχρίσας μίλ-

**CHAPTER XIII.**

**1** FOR indeed, vain are all men by nature,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in whom was the ignorance of God,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and from the good things seen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they were not able to know Him Who exists;
**2** nor by giving heed to the works
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;did they recognize the Craftsman;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but either fire, or spirit, or swift air,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or the circle of the stars, or violent water,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or the luminaries of heaven—
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these they deemed to be gods, the rulers of the cosmos.
**3** Of whom, if indeed, delighted by their beauty,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they supposed these to be gods,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let them know how much better than these
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is their Lord;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the Author of beauty created them.
**4** But if, astonished by [their] power and activity,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let them perceive from them how much more powerful
**5** is He Who made them;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for from the greatness and beauty of created things
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their Creator is proportionately seen.
**6** But yet, concerning these, the blame is slight;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for they themselves perhaps wander,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seeking God and desiring to find Him;
**7** for being occupied in His works, they search diligently,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and are persuaded by sight that the things seen are beautiful.
**8** (But again, neither are they themselves to be excused;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for if they were able to know so much,
**9** that they might be able to estimate the world,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how did they not more quickly find the Lord of these things?)
**10** Wretched also are their hopes, even among the dead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who called gods the works of men's hands:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;golden and silver workmanship of art,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and likenesses of beasts,
**11** or a useless stone, the ancient work of a hand.
**12** For if also some wood-cutter craftsman,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;having cut down a pliant tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;did skillfully scrape off all its bark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and having artfully made it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fashioned a useful vessel for the service of life;
**13** then having used the remnants of the work
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the preparation of food, was satisfied;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the refuse from them, useful for nothing—
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a crooked piece of wood and grown together with knots—
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taking it, he carved with diligent work,
**14** and with skillful understanding he shaped it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he made it like an image of a man,
**15** or likened it to some vile animal,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;having coated it with red ochre and with seaweed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dyeing its color red,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and having covered every stain that was in it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and having made for it a dwelling worthy of itself,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he placed it on a wall, having secured it with iron;
**16** therefore, that it might not fall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he provided for it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knowing that it was still unable to help itself;
**17** (for it is but an image and hath need of help)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but concerning his possessions and his marriages and his children,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he is not ashamed to speak unto the lifeless thing;
**18** and concerning health, he calleth upon that which is weak;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and concerning life, he entreateth that which is dead;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and concerning aid, he supplicateth that which is utterly without experience;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and concerning journeying, that which is unable even to use its feet.
