10 καὶ ῥομφαία, ἐπαγωγαὶ, λιμὸς καὶ σύντριμμα καὶ μάστιξ, ἐπὶ τοὺς
11 ἀνόμους ἐκτίσθη πάντα ταῦτα, καὶ δι᾽ αὐτοὺς ἐγένετο ὁ κατακλυ-
12 σμός. Πάντα ὅσα ἀπὸ γῆς, εἰς γῆν ἀναστρέφει, καὶ ἀπὸ ὑδάτων
13 εἰς θάλασσαν ἀνακάμπτει. Πᾶν δῶρον καὶ ἀδικία ἐξαλειφθήσεται·
14 ξηρανθήσεται, καὶ ὡς βροντὴ μεγάλη ἐν ὑετῷ ἐξηχήσει· ἐν τῷ
15 ἀνοῖξαι αὐτὸν χεῖρας εὐφρανθήσεται, οὕτως οἱ παραβαίνοντες εἰς
16 συντέλειαν ἐκλείψουσιν. Ἔκγονα ἀσεβῶν οὐ πληθυνεῖ κλάδους, καὶ
17 ῥίζαι ἀκάθαρτοι ἐπ᾽ ἀκροτόμου πέτρας· ἄχι ἐπὶ παντὸς ὕδατος
18 καὶ χεῖλος ποταμοῦ πρὸ παντὸς χόρτου ἐκτιλήσεται. Χάρις ὡς
19 παράδεισος ἐν εὐλογίαις, καὶ ἐλεημοσύνη εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα διαμένει.
20 Ζωὴ αὐτάρκους καὶ ἐργάτου γλυκανθήσεται, καὶ ὑπὲρ ἀμφότερα
21 ὃ εὑρίσκων θησαυρόν. Τέκνα καὶ οἰκοδομὴ πόλεως στηρίζουσιν
22 ὄνομα, καὶ ὑπὲρ ἀμφότερα γυνὴ ἄμωμος λογίζεται. Οἶνος καὶ
23 μουσικὰ εὐφραίνουσι καρδίαν, καὶ ὑπὲρ ἀμφότερα ἀγάπησις σοφίας·
24 Αὐλὸς καὶ ψαλτήριον ἡδύνουσι μέλη, καὶ ὑπὲρ ἀμφότερα γλῶσσα
25 ἡδεῖα. Χάριν καὶ κάλλος ἐπιθυμήσει ὀφθαλμός, καὶ ὑπὲρ ἀμφότερα
26 χλόην σπόρου. Φίλος καὶ ἑταῖρος εἰς καιρὸν ἀπαντῶντες, καὶ
27 ὑπὲρ ἀμφότερα γυνὴ μετ᾽ ἀνδρός. Ἀδελφοὶ καὶ βοήθεια εἰς καιρὸν
28 θλίψεως, καὶ ὑπὲρ ἀμφότερα ἐλεημοσύνη ῥύσεται. Χρυσίον καὶ
29 ἀργύριον ἐπιστήσουσι πόδα, καὶ ὑπὲρ ἀμφότερα βουλὴ εὐδοκιμεῖ-
30 ται. Χρήματα καὶ ἰσχὺς ἀνυψοῦσι καρδίαν, καὶ ὑπὲρ ἀμφότερα
31 φόβος Κυρίου· οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν φόβῳ Κυρίου ἐλάττωσις, καὶ οὐκ
32 ἔστιν ἐπιζητῆσαι ἐν αὐτῷ βοήθειαν· φόβος Κυρίου ὡς παρά-
33 δεισος εὐλογίας, καὶ ὑπὲρ πᾶσαν δόξαν ἐκάλυψεν αὐτόν. Τέκνον,
34 ζωὴν ἐπαιτήσεως μὴ βιώσῃς· κρεῖσσον ἀποθανεῖν, ἢ ἐπαιτεῖν. Ἀ-
35 νὴρ βλέπων εἰς τράπεζαν ἀλλοτρίαν, οὐκ ἔστιν αὐτοῦ ὁ βίος ἐν
36 λογισμῷ ζωῆς· ἀλισγήσει ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ ἐν ἐδέσμασιν ἀλλοτρίοις,
37 ἀνὴρ δὲ ἐπιστήμων καὶ πεπαιδευμένος φυλάξεται. Ἐν στόματι
38 ἀναιδοῦς γλυκανθήσεται ἐπαίτησις· καὶ ἐν κοιλίᾳ αὐτοῦ πῦρ καή-
39 σεται.

**Chapter Forty**

10 and a sword, visitations, famine and crushing and scourge: all these things were created for the lawless,
11 and for their sakes came to pass the deluge.
12 All things that are from the earth, unto the earth do they return, and all waters
13 unto the sea do they flow back. Every gift and injustice shall be blotted out;
14 it shall dry up, and as a great thunder in the rain shall it resound; when one openeth his hands,
15 he shall rejoice, so shall transgressors fail unto their full end.
16 The offspring of the ungodly shall not multiply branches, and unclean roots
17 [shall be] upon a steep rock; the reed by every water and the bank of a river
18 before every grass shall be plucked up. Grace is as a paradise
19 in blessings, and almsgiving abideth unto eternity.
20 The life of him that is self-sufficient and of a labourer shall be sweetened, and better than both of these
21 is he that findeth treasure. Children and the building of a city establish
22 a name, and better than both of these is a blameless wife esteemed. Wine and
23 music gladden the heart, and better than both of these is the love of wisdom.
24 The flute and the psaltery sweeten the melodies, and better than both of these is a pleasant tongue.
25 Grace and beauty shall the eye desire, and better than both of these
26 is the verdure of the seed. A friend and a companion meeting in due season, and
27 better than both of these is a wife with her husband. Brethren and help in a time of
28 tribulation, and better than both of these shall almsgiving deliver. Gold and
29 silver shall establish a foot, and better than both of these doth counsel prosper.
30 Riches and strength do uplift the heart, and better than both of these
31 is the fear of the Lord; there is no diminution in the fear of the Lord, neither
32 is there need to seek for help in it; the fear of the Lord is as a paradise
33 of blessings, and above all glory hath it covered him. My child,
34 a life of begging do not thou live; better it is to die than to beg. A
35 man that looketh unto a stranger's table, his life is not in
36 the reckoning of life; he shall defile his soul with stranger's food,
37 but a man of understanding and training shall guard himself. In the mouth
38 of an impudent man, begging shall be sweet; and in his belly shall fire be
39 kindled.

**Chapter Forty-One**

1 O Death, how bitter is the remembrance of thee unto a man
