**49** τὴν ἡμέραν ἐκείνην ἡμέραν εὐφροσύνης μεγάλην. Καὶ ἔστησαν τοῦ ἀγαγεῖν κατ᾿ ἐνιαυτὸν τὴν ἡμέραν ταύτην τῇ τρισκαιδεκάτῃ

**ΚΕΦ. Ηʹ. VIII.**

**1** ΚΑΙ ἤκουσαν Ἰούδας τὸ ὄνομα τῶν Ῥωμαίων, ὅτι εἰσὶ δυνατοὶ ἐν ἰσχύϊ, καὶ αὐτοὶ εὐδοκοῦσιν ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς προστεθειμένοις
**2** θῶσιν αὐτοῖς, ἐστῶσιν αὐτοῖς φιλίαν· Καὶ ὅτι εἰσὶ δυνατοὶ ἰσχύϊ· καὶ διηγήσαντο αὐτῷ τοὺς πολέμους αὐτῶν καὶ τὰς ἀνδραγαθίας ἃς ποιοῦσιν ἐν τοῖς Γαλάταις, καὶ ὅτι κατεκράτησαν αὐτῶν, καὶ
**3** ἤγαγον αὐτοὺς ὑπὸ φόρον· Καὶ ὅσα ἐποίησαν ἐν χώρᾳ Ἰσπανίας, τοῦ κατακρατῆσαι τῶν μετάλλων τοῦ ἀργυρίου καὶ τοῦ χρυσίου τοῦ ἐκεῖ. Καὶ κατεκράτησαν τοῦ τόπου παντὸς τῇ βουλῇ
**4** αὐτῶν καὶ τῇ μακροθυμίᾳ, καὶ ὁ τόπος ἦν μακρὰν ἀπέχων ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν σφόδρα· καὶ τῶν βασιλέων τῶν ἐπελθόντων ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς ἀπ᾿ ἄκρου τῆς γῆς, ἕως συνέτριψαν αὐτούς, καὶ ἐπάταξαν ἐν αὐτοῖς πληγὴν μεγάλην, καὶ οἱ ἐπίλοιποι διδόασιν αὐτοῖς φόρον
**5** κατ᾿ ἐνιαυτόν· Καὶ τὸν Φίλιππον καὶ τὸν Περσέα Κιτιέων βασιλέα, καὶ τοὺς ἐπηρμένους ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς συνέτριψαν αὐτοὺς ἐν
**6** πολέμῳ, καὶ κατεκράτησαν αὐτῶν· Καὶ Ἀντίοχον τὸν μέγαν βασιλέα τῆς Ἀσίας τὸν πορευθέντα ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς εἰς πόλεμον ἔχοντα ἑκατὸν εἴκοσι ἐλέφαντας καὶ ἵππον καὶ ἅρματα καὶ δύναμιν
**7** πολλὴν σφόδρα, καὶ συνέτριψαν ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἔλαβον αὐτὸν ζῶντα, καὶ ἔστησαν, αὐτοῖς διδόναι αὐτόν τε καὶ τοὺς βασιλεύοντας μετ᾿ αὐτὸν φόρον μέγαν, καὶ διδόναι ὅμηρα καὶ διαστολήν,

**49** that day as a great day of rejoicing. And they appointed that this day, the thirteenth of Adar, should be kept annually.

**Chapter 8**

**1** Now Judas heard the renown of the Romans, that they were mighty in strength, and that they were well-disposed unto all who should submit themselves unto them,
**2** to establish friendship for them if they would make a covenant with them. And [they heard again] that they were mighty in power. And they recounted unto him their wars and the valiant deeds which they had wrought among the Galatians, and how they had overcome them, and
**3** brought them under tribute. And [they told him] all that they had done in the land of Spain, to take possession of the mines of silver and gold that were there. And they had mastered all that region by their counsel
**4** and their long endurance, though the place was very far distant from them; and concerning the kings who had come against them from the uttermost part of the earth, until they had crushed them, and had smitten them with a great slaughter, and the remnant paid tribute unto them
**5** year by year. And [how] they had crushed Philip and Perseus, the king of the Kittim, and those who had risen up against them, crushing them in
**6** battle, and had overcome them. And [how] Antiochus the Great, the king of Asia, who came against them to war, having a hundred and twenty elephants, and horsemen, and chariots, and a very great army,
**7** they utterly defeated from him. And they took him alive, and stipulated that he himself, and those who should reign after him, should pay a great tribute unto them, and should give hostages and a [strict] regulation,
**8** and the land of India, and Media, and Lydia, and from among their finest lands; and having taken these from him,
**9** they gave them unto King Eumenes. And [how] those of Greece
**10** had taken counsel to come and utterly destroy them. But the matter became known unto them, and they sent one general against them, and warred against them, and many of them fell wounded, and they took their wives and their children captive, and plundered them; and they took possession of their land, and overthrew their strongholds, and plundered them, and
