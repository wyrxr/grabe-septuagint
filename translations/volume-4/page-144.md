λεμαίου τοῦ Φιλομήτορος βασιλέως, μεταλαβὼν Ἀντίοχος ἀλλότριον αὑτὸν τῶν αὑτοῦ γεγονέναι πραγμάτων, τῆς κατ᾽ αὑτὸν ἀσφαλείας ἐφρόντιζεν· ὅθεν εἰς Ἰόππην παραγενόμενος, κατήντησεν εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα. Μεγαλομερῶς δὲ ὑπὸ τοῦ Ἰάσωνος καὶ 22
τῆς πόλεως ἀποδεχθεὶς μετὰ δᾳδουχίας καὶ βοῶν εἰσεδέχθη· εἶθ᾽ οὕτως εἰς τὴν Φοινίκην κατεστρατοπέδευσε. Μετὰ δὲ τριετῆ 23
χρόνον ἀπέστειλεν Ἰάσων Μενέλαον τὸν τοῦ προσημαινομένου Σίμωνος ἀδελφόν, παρακομίζοντα τὰ χρήματα τῷ βασιλεῖ, καὶ περὶ πραγμάτων ἀναγκαίων ὑπομνηματισμοὺς τελέσοντα. Ὁ δὲ 24
συσταθεὶς τῷ βασιλεῖ καὶ δοξάσας αὑτὸν τῷ προσώπῳ τῆς ἐξουσίας, εἰς ἑαυτὸν κατήντησε τὴν ἀρχιερωσύνην, ὑπερβαλλὼν τὸν Ἰάσωνα τάλαντα ἀργυρίου τριακόσια. Λαβὼν δὲ τὰς βασιλικὰς 25
ἐντολὰς παρεγίνετο, τῆς μὲν ἀρχιερωσύνης οὐδὲν ἄξιον ἔχων, θυμοὺς δὲ ὠμοῦ τυράννου καὶ θηρὸς βαρβάρου ἔργα ἔχων. Καὶ 26
ὁ μὲν Ἰάσων ὁ τὸν ἴδιον ἀδελφὸν ὑπονοθεύσας, ὑπονοθευθεὶς ὑφ᾽ ἑτέρου φυγὰς εἰς τὴν Ἀμμανῖτιν χώραν συνήλαστο. Ὁ δὲ 27
Μενέλαος τῆς μὲν ἀρχῆς ἐκράτει, τῶν δὲ ἐπηγγελμένων τῷ βασιλεῖ χρημάτων οὐδὲν εὐτάκτει. Πισιουμένου δὲ τὴν ἀπαίτησιν 28
Σωστράτου τοῦ τῆς ἀκροπόλεως ἐπάρχου πρὸς τοῦτον χάριν ἢ τῶν διαφόρων πράξεις· δι᾽ ἣν αἰτίαν οἱ δύο ὑπὸ τοῦ βασιλέως προσεκλήθησαν· Καὶ ὁ μὲν Μενέλαος ἀπέλειπε τῆς ἀρχιερωσύνης 29
διάδοχον Λυσίμαχον τὸν ἑαυτοῦ ἀδελφόν, Σώστρατος δὲ, Κράτητα τὸν ἐπὶ τῶν Κυπρίων. Τοιούτων δὲ συνεστήκότων, συνέβη 30
Ταρσεῖς καὶ Μαλλῶτας στασιάζειν, διὰ τὸ Ἀντιοχίδι τῇ παλλακῆ τοῦ βασιλέως ἐν δωρεᾷ δεδοθαι. Θᾶττον οὖν ὁ βασιλεὺς 31
ἧκε καταστεῖλαι τὰ πράγματα, καταλείπων τὸν διαδεχόμενον Ἀνδρόνικον τῶν ἐν Ἀξιώματι κειμένων. Νομίσας δὲ ὁ Μενέλαος 32
εἰληφέναι καιρὸν εὐφυῆ, χρυσώματά τινα τῶν τοῦ ἱεροῦ νοσφισάμενος ἐχαρίσατο τῷ Ἀνδρονίκῳ, καὶ ἕτερα ἐτύγχανε πεπρακὼς εἰς τε Τύρον καὶ τὰς κύκλῳ πόλεις. Ἃ καὶ σαφῶς ἐπεγνωκὼς 33
δ᾽ Ὀνίας, παρήγγελλεν ἀποκεχωρηκὼς εἰς ἄσυλον τόπον, ἐπὶ Δάφνης τῆς πρὸς Ἀντιόχειαν κειμένης· Ὅθεν ὁ Μενέλαος λαβὼν 34
ἰδίᾳ Ἀνδρόνικον, παρεκάλει χειρώσασθαι τὸν Ὀνίαν· ὁ δὲ παραγενόμενος ἐπὶ τὸν Ὀνίαν, καὶ πεισθεὶς ἐπὶ δόλῳ, καὶ δεξιὰς θεὶς μεθ᾽ ὅρκων, δοὺς δεξιάν, καὶ περ ἐν ὑποψίᾳ κείμενος, ἔπεισεν ἐκ τοῦ ἀσύλου προελθεῖν, ἔνθα καὶ παραχρῆμα παρεκλεισεν οὐκ αἰδεσθεὶς τὸ δίκαιον.

#### CHAPTER IV.

...King Ptolemy Philometor, Antiochus, perceiving himself alienated from his own affairs, did then give heed unto his personal safety. Wherefore, having come unto Joppa, he journeyed unto Jerusalem.
**22** And being grandly received by Jason and the city, with torch-lightings and with great shouts was he welcomed; then in this wise did he encamp in Phoenicia.
**23** And after a space of three years, Jason sent Menelaus, the brother of the aforementioned Simon, conveying the monies unto the king, and to finalize [the records of] pressing matters.
**24** And he, having been introduced unto the king, and glorifying himself by means of royal authority, did bring the high priesthood upon himself, outbidding Jason by three hundred talents of silver.
**25** And having received the royal commands, he came, having nothing worthy of the high priesthood, but possessed the fierce passions of a cruel tyrant and the deeds of a savage beast.
**26** And Jason, who had supplanted his own brother, being supplanted by another, was driven as a fugitive into the land of Ammonitis.
**27** And Menelaus indeed held the principality, but of the monies promised unto the king, he did not acquit himself of any part.
**28** Now Sostratus, the commander of the citadel, did earnestly press for the demand [of payment], either on his [Menelaus's] behalf or for the transactions of the arrears; for which cause the two were summoned by the king.
**29** And Menelaus left as successor to the high priesthood Lysimachus his own brother; and Sostratus [left] Cratetes, who was over the Cyprians.
**30** And while such matters were being established, it came to pass that the people of Tarsus and Mallus were in revolt, because they had been given as a gift to Antiochis, the king's concubine.
**31** Therefore, the king quickly came to quell these matters, leaving Andronicus, appointed to administer those in high office, in charge.
**32** But Menelaus, thinking he had gotten an opportune season, having purloined certain golden vessels from the Temple, did he bestow them upon Andronicus as a gift; and other [items] he happened to have sold both in Tyre and the cities round about.
**33** And Onias, having clearly perceived these things, did give warning, having withdrawn himself unto a place of asylum, at Daphne, which is near Antioch.
**34** Whereupon Menelaus, taking Andronicus aside privately, did beseech him to lay hands upon Onias; and he, having come unto Onias, and being won over by guile, and having given pledges with oaths, yea, even pledging his right hand, and though [Onias] was yet [warily] suspicious, did persuade him to come forth from the asylum, where immediately he did enclose him, not reverencing justice.
