**ΚΕΦ. ΛΗʹ. ΛΘʹ. ΙΗΣΟΥ ΥΙΟΥ ΣΙΡΑΧ 1833**
ἐμοὶ ἐχθές, καὶ σοὶ σήμερον. Ἐν ἀναπαύσει νεκροῦ κατάπαυσον 23
τὸ μνημόσυνον αὐτοῦ, καὶ παρακληθήτῃ ἐν αὐτῷ ἐν ἐξόδῳ πνεύμα-
τος αὐτοῦ. Σοφία γραμματέως ἐν εὐκαιρίᾳ σχολῆς, καὶ δ᾽ ἐλασσούμενός 24
πράξει αὐτοῦ σοφισθήσεται. Τί σοφισθήσεται ὁ κρατῶν 25
ἀρότρου, καὶ καυχώμενος ἐν δόρατι ; κέντρῳ βόας ἐλαύνων, καὶ
ἀναστρεφόμενος ἐν ἔργοις αὐτῶν, καὶ ἡ διήγησις αὐτοῦ ἐν υἱοῖς
ταύρων· καρδίαν αὐτοῦ δώσει ἐκδοῦναι αὔλακας, καὶ ἡ ἀγρυπνία 26
αὐτοῦ εἰς χορτάσματα δαμάλεων. Οὕτως πᾶς τέκτων καὶ ἀρχι- 27
τέκτων, ὅστις νύκτωρ ὡς ἡμέρας διάγει· οἱ γλύφοντες γλύμματα
σφραγίδων, καὶ ἡ ἐπιμονὴ αὐτοῦ ἀλλοιῶσαι ποικιλίαν· καρδίαν
αὐτοῦ δώσει εἰς ὁμοιῶσαι ζωγραφίαν, καὶ ἡ ἀγρυπνία αὐτοῦ τε- 28
λέσαι ἔργον. Οὕτως χαλκεὺς καθήμενος ἐγγὺς ἄκμονος, καὶ κα-
ταμανθάνων ἔργον σιδήρου· ἀτμὶς πυρὸς τήξει σάρκας αὐτοῦ, καὶ
ἐν θέρμῃ καμίνου διαμαχήσεται· φωνὴ σφύρης καὶ ἄκμονος κναίει
τὸ οὖς αὐτοῦ, καὶ κατέναντι ὁμοιώματος σκεύους οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ
αὐτοῦ· καρδίαν αὐτοῦ δώσει εἰς συντέλειαν ἔργων, καὶ ἡ ἀγρυπνία 29
αὐτοῦ κοσμῆσαι ἐπὶ συντελείας. Οὕτως κεραμεὺς καθήμενος ἐν
ἔργῳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ συστρέφων ἐν ποσὶν αὐτοῦ τροχόν, ὃς ἐν μερί-
μνῃ κεῖται διαπαντὸς ἐπὶ τὸ ἔργον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐναρίθμιος πᾶσα
ἡ ἐργασία αὐτοῦ· ἐν βραχίονι αὐτοῦ τυπώσει πηλόν, καὶ πρὸ πο- 30
δῶν κάμψει ἰσχὺν αὐτοῦ· καρδίαν ἐπιδώσει συντελέσαι τὸ χρίσμα,
καὶ ἡ ἀγρυπνία αὐτοῦ καθαρίσαι κάμινον. Πάντες οὗτοι εἰς χεῖ- 31
ρας ἔχωσιν· ἐνεπίστευσαν, καὶ ἕκαστος ἐν τῷ ἔργῳ αὐτοῦ σοφί-
ζεται. Ἄνευ αὐτῶν οὐκ οἰκήσεται πόλις, καὶ οὐ παροικήσουσιν 32
οὐδὲ περιπατήσουσιν· ἐν βουλῇ λαοῦ οὐ ζητηθήσονται, καὶ ἐν 33
ἐκκλησίᾳ οὐχ ὑπεραλοῦνται· ἐπὶ δίφρον δυνάστου οὐ καθιοῦν-
ται, καὶ διαθήκην κρίματος οὐ διανοηθήσονται, οὐδὲ μὴ ἐκ-
φανῶσι παιδείαν καὶ κρίμα, καὶ ἐν παραβολαῖς οὐχ εὑρεθή-
σονται· ἀλλὰ κτίσμα αἰῶνος στηρίσουσι, καὶ ἡ δέησις αὐτῶν 34
ἐν ἐργασίᾳ τέχνης.

**ΚΕΦ. ΛΘʹ. ΧΧΧΙΧ.**

ΠΛΗΝ τοῦ ἐπιδιδόντος τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ, καὶ διανοουμένου 1
ἐν νόμῳ ὑψίστου, σοφίαν πάντων ἀρχαίων ἐκζητήσει, καὶ ἐν προ-
φητείαις ἀσχοληθήσεται· διήγησιν ἀνδρῶν ὀνομαστῶν συντηρήσει, 2

**Chapter Thirty-Eight**

23 to me it was yesterday, and unto thee it is today.
    In the rest of the dead, let his memorial cease;
    and let him be comforted concerning him at the departure of his spirit.
24 The wisdom of a scribe cometh by the opportunity of leisure,
    and he that is lessened in his work shall be made wise.
25 How shall he become wise that holdeth the plough,
    and boasteth in the goad?
    [Even he that is] driving oxen with a goad,
26 and occupied with their labours;
    and his discourse is among the young bulls.
    He shall give his heart to making furrows,
    and his vigilance
    is for the fodder of heifers.
27 So also every carpenter and master builder,
    who spendeth his nights as days;
28 they that carve engraved seals,
    and whose perseverance is to vary the design;
    he shall give his heart to portraying a likeness,
    and his sleeplessness is to finish his work.
29 So also the smith, sitting by the anvil,
    and observing the work of iron;
    the vapor of fire shall melt his flesh,
    and in the heat of the furnace shall he contend.
    The sound of the hammer and the anvil doth deafen his ear,
    and before the pattern of the vessel are his eyes.
    He shall give his heart to the completion of his works,
    and his sleeplessness
    is to adorn for completion.
30 So also the potter, sitting at his work,
    and turning the wheel with his feet;
    whose concern is ever upon his work,
    and all his labour is precise.
    He shall shape the clay with his arm,
    and before his feet
    shall he bend his strength.
31 He shall apply his heart to completing the glaze,
    and his sleeplessness is to clean the kiln.
    All these [men], let them have [skill] in their hands;
    they have put their trust [therein],
    and each one is made wise in his work.
32 Without these, a city shall not be inhabited,
    and they shall not sojourn [therein],
    nor shall they walk about [with ease].
33 In the counsel of the people shall they not be sought,
    and in the assembly shall they not be advanced.
    Upon the seat of the ruler shall they not sit,
    and the covenant of judgment shall they not understand;
    nor shall they declare instruction and judgment,
    and in parables shall they not be found.
34 But they shall establish the creation of the world,
    and their prayer is in the work of their craft.

**Chapter Thirty-Nine**

1 But him that giveth his soul [unto it],
    and meditateth in the law of the Most High,
    he shall seek out the wisdom of all the ancients,
    and in prophecies shall he be occupied.
2 He shall preserve the narrative of famous men,
