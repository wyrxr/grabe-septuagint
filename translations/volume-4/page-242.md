**ΣΟΦΙΑ ΚΕΦ. Ηʹ.**

**17.** Χειρῶν αὐτῆς πλοῦτος ἀνεκλιπής, καὶ ἐν συγγυμνασίᾳ ὁμιλίας
αὐτῆς φρόνησις, καὶ εὐκλεία ἐν κοινωνίᾳ λόγων αὐτῆς, περιεῖχεν
ζητῶν ὅπως λάβω αὐτὴν εἰς ἐμαυτόν.
**19.** Παῖς δὲ ἤμην εὐφυής,
**20.** ψυχῆς τε ἔλαχον ἀγαθῆς· μᾶλλον δὲ ἀγαθὸς ὤν, ἦλθον εἰς σῶμα
ἀμίαντον.
**21.** Γνοὺς δὲ ὅτι οὐκ ἄλλως ἔσομαι ἐγκρατής, ἐὰν μὴ ὁ
Θεὸς δῷ, (καὶ τοῦτο δ᾽ ἦν φρονήσεως τὸ εἰδέναι τίνος ἡ χάρις,)
ἐνέτυχον τῷ Κυρίῳ, καὶ ἐδεήθην αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπον ἐξ ὅλης τῆς
καρδίας μου.

**ΚΕΦ. Θʹ. ΙΧ.**

**1.** ΘΕΕ πατέρων καὶ Κύριε τοῦ ἐλέους σου, ὁ ποιήσας τὰ πάντα
ἐν λόγῳ σου,
**2.** καὶ τῇ σοφίᾳ σου κατασκευάσας ἄνθρωπον, ἵνα δεσπόζῃ
τῶν ὑπὸ σοῦ γενομένων κτισμάτων,
**3.** καὶ διέπῃ τὸν κόσμον ἐν ὁσιότητι καὶ δικαιοσύνῃ, καὶ ἐν εὐθύτητι ψυχῆς κρίσιν κρίνῃ·
**4.** δὸς μοι τὴν τῶν σῶν θρόνων πάρεδρον σοφίαν, καὶ μὴ με ἀποδοκιμάσῃς ἐκ
παίδων σου·
**5.** ὅτι ἐγὼ δοῦλος σὸς καὶ υἱὸς τῆς παιδίσκης σου, ἄνθρωπος ἀσθενὴς καὶ ὀλιγοχρόνιος, καὶ ἐλάσσων ἐν συνέσει κρίσεως
καὶ νόμων·
**6.** κἂν γάρ τις ἢ τέλειος ἐν υἱοῖς ἀνθρώπων, τῆς ἀπὸ
σοῦ σοφίας ἀπούσης, εἰς οὐδὲν λογισθήσεται.
**7.** Σύ με προείλου βασιλέα λαοῦ σου, καὶ δικαστὴν υἱῶν σου καὶ θυγατέρων σου·
**8.** εἶπας οἰκοδομῆσαι ναὸν ἐν ὄρει ἁγίῳ σου, καὶ ἐν πόλει κατασκηνώσεώς σου θυσιαστήριον, μίμημα σκηνῆς ἁγίας ἣν προητοίμασας ἀπ᾽ ἀρχῆς,
**9.** καὶ μετὰ σοῦ ἡ σοφία ἡ εἰδυῖα τὰ ἔργα σου, καὶ παροῦσα ὅτε ἐποίεις τὸν κόσμον, καὶ ἐπισταμένη τί ἀρεστὸν ἐν
ὀφθαλμοῖς σου, καὶ τί εὐθὲς ἐν ἐντολαῖς σου·
**10.** ἐξαπόστειλον αὐτὴν ἐξ ἁγίων οὐρανῶν, καὶ ἀπὸ θρόνου δόξης σου πέμψον αὐτήν, ἵνα
συμπαροῦσά μοι κοπιάσῃ, καὶ γνῶ τί εὐάρεστόν ἐστι παρὰ σοί.
**11.** Οἶδε γὰρ ἐκείνη πάντα καὶ συνιεῖ, καὶ ὁδηγήσει με ἐν ταῖς πράξεσί μου σωφρόνως, καὶ φυλάξει με ἐν τῇ δόξῃ αὐτῆς·
**12.** καὶ ἐξαι προδεκτὰ τὰ ἔργα μου, καὶ διακρινῶ τὸν λαόν σου δικαίως, καὶ
ἔσομαι ἄξιος θρόνων πατρός μου.
**13.** Τίς γὰρ ἄνθρωπος γνώσεται
βουλὴν Θεοῦ; ἢ τίς ἐνθυμηθήσεται τί θέλει ὁ Κύριος;
**14.** Λογισμοὶ γὰρ θνητῶν δειλοί, καὶ ἐπισφαλεῖς αἱ ἐπίνοιαι ἡμῶν·
**15.** φθαρτὸν γὰρ σῶμα βαρύνει ψυχήν, καὶ βρίθει τὸ γεῶδες σκῆνος νοῦν
πολυφροντίδα.
**16.** Καὶ μόγις εἰκάζομεν τὰ ἐπὶ γῆς, καὶ τὰ ἐν χερσὶν εὑρίσκομεν μετὰ πόνου· τὰ δὲ ἐν οὐρανοῖς τίς ἐξιχνιάσε;

**CHAPTER VIII.**

**17** in labors of her hands [is] wealth inexhaustible; and in the co-exercise of her discourse, prudence; and renown in the fellowship of her words. These [things] did she encompass, as I sought how I might take her unto myself.
**19** Now I was a child of good natural parts,
**20** and a good soul also did I obtain; but rather, being good, I came into a body undefiled.
**21** And knowing that in no other wise should I be master of myself, unless God grant it—(and this too was of prudence, to know whose the grace [is])—I made supplication unto the Lord, and besought Him, and I spake from all my heart:

**CHAPTER IX.**

**1** O God of [our] fathers, and Lord of Thy mercy, Who hast made all things by Thy Word,
**2** and by Thy Wisdom hast fashioned man, that he might have dominion over the creatures made by Thee,
**3** and might order the world in holiness and righteousness, and in uprightness of soul might judge judgment;
**4** Give unto me Wisdom, the assessor of Thy thrones, and do not reject me from [among] Thy children;
**5** for I am Thy servant and the son of Thine handmaid, a man weak and short-lived, and lesser in understanding of judgment and of laws.
**6** For even if one be perfect among the sons of men, if Thy Wisdom be absent from him, he shall be accounted as nothing.
**7** Thou didst choose me to be king of Thy people, and a judge of Thy sons and of Thy daughters;
**8** Thou didst bid me to build a temple upon Thy holy mountain, and in the city of Thy dwelling places an altar, a copy of the holy tabernacle which Thou hadst prepared from the beginning.
**9** And with Thee is Wisdom, Who knoweth Thy works, and was present when Thou didst make the world, and understandeth what is pleasing in Thy sight, and what is right in Thy commandments.
**10** Send her forth from [Thy] holy heavens, and from the throne of Thy glory do Thou send her, that being present with me, she may toil [with me], and I may know what is well-pleasing unto Thee.
**11** For she knoweth all things and understandeth [them], and she shall guide me prudently in my actions, and she shall keep me by her glory.
**12** And my works **shall be** [exceptionally] fore-acceptable, and I shall judge Thy people righteously, and I shall be worthy of the thrones of my father.
**13** For what man shall know the counsel of God? or who shall conceive what the Lord willeth?
**14** For the thoughts of mortals are timid, and our devices are uncertain.
**15** For a corruptible body doth weigh down the soul, and the earthly tabernacle doth press down the mind fraught with many cares.
**16** And with difficulty do we guess at the things upon the earth, and the things in our hands do we find with toil; but the things in the heavens, who shall trace out?
