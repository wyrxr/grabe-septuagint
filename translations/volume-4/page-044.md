ἀλλ᾽ ἔθραυσε τοὺς ἐχθροὺς ἡμῶν, διὰ χειρός μου ἐν τῇ νυκτὶ
ταύτῃ. Καὶ προσελθοῦσα τὴν κεφαλὴν ἐκ τῆς θήρας ἔδειξεν, καὶ 15
Ἀσσούρ, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἡ κεφαλὴ Ὀλοφέρνου ἀρχιστρατήγου δυνάμεως
Ἀσσούρ, καὶ ἰδοὺ τὸ κωνωπεῖον αὐτοῦ ἐν ᾧ κατέκειτο ἐν ταῖς
μέλαις αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτὸν ὁ Κύριος ἐν χειρὶ θηλείας.
Καὶ ζῇ ὁ Κύριος ὃς διεφύλαξέ με ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ μου ᾗ ἐπορεύθην, 16
ὅτι ἡπάτησεν αὐτὸν τὸ πρόσωπόν μου εἰς ἀπώλειαν αὐτοῦ, καὶ
οὐκ ἐποίησεν ἁμάρτημα μετ᾽ ἐμοῦ εἰς μίασμα καὶ αἰσχύνην. Καὶ 17
ἐξέστη πᾶς ὁ λαὸς σφόδρα, καὶ κύψαντες προσεκύνησαν τῷ Θεῷ,
καὶ εἶπαν ὁμοθυμαδὸν· εὐλογητὸς εἶ ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν, ὁ ἐξουδενώ-
σας ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ σήμερον τοὺς ἐχθροὺς τοῦ λαοῦ σου. Καὶ 18
εἶπεν αὐτῇ Ὀζίας· εὐλογημένη εἶ σὺ θυγάτηρ τῷ Θεῷ τῷ ὑψί-
στω παρὰ πάσας τὰς γυναῖκας τὰς ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, καὶ εὐλογημέ-
νος Κύριος ὁ Θεός, ὃς ἔκτισε τοὺς οὐρανοὺς καὶ τὴν γῆν, ὃς
κατεύθυνέ σε εἰς τραῦμα κεφαλῆς ἀρχοντος ἐχθρῶν ἡμῶν, ὅτι οὐκ 19
ἀποστήσεται ἡ ἐλπίς σου ἀπὸ καρδίας ἀνθρώπων μνημονευόντων
ἰσχὺν Θεοῦ ἕως αἰῶνος. Καὶ ποιήσει σοι αὐτὰ ὁ Θεὸς εἰς ὕψος 20
αἰώνιον, τοῦ ἐπισκέψασθαί σε ἐν ἀγαθοῖς ἀφ᾽ ὧν οὐκ ἐφείσω τῆς
ψυχῆς σου διὰ τὴν ταπείνωσιν τοῦ γένους ἡμῶν, ἀλλ᾽ ἐπεξῆλθες
τῷ πτώματι ἡμῶν, ἐπ᾽ εὐθεῖαν πορευθεῖσα ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν.
καὶ εἶπαν πᾶς ὁ λαός· γένοιτο, γένοιτο.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΔʹ. XIV.

ΚΑΙ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτοὺς Ἰουδὶθ· ἀκούσατε δή μου, ἀδελφοί, 1
καὶ λαβόντες τὴν κεφαλὴν ταύτην, κρεμάσατε αὐτὴν ἐπὶ τῆς ἐπάλξεως
τοῦ τείχους ὑμῶν. Καὶ ἔσται ἡνίκα ἐὰν διαφαύσῃ ὁ 2
ὄρθρος, καὶ ἐξέλθῃ ὁ ἥλιος ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, ἀναλήψεσθε ἕκαστος τὰ
σκευήν τὰ πολεμικὰ ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐξελεύσεσθε πᾶς ἀνὴρ ἰσχύων ἔξω
τῆς πόλεως, καὶ δώσετε ἀρχηγὸν εἰς αὐτοῦς, ὡς καταβαίνοντες
ἐπὶ τὸ πεδίον εἰς τὴν προφυλακὴν υἱῶν Ἀσσοῦρ, καὶ οὐ καταβή-
σεσθε. Καὶ ἀναλαβόντες οὗτοι τὰς πανοπλίας αὐτῶν, πορεύσονται 3
εἰς τὰς παρεμβολὰς αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐγεροῦσι τοὺς στρατηγοὺς
τῆς δυνάμεως Ἀσσοῦρ, καὶ συνδραμοῦνται ἐπὶ τὴν σκηνὴν Ὁλοφέρνου,
καὶ οὐχ εὑρήσουσιν αὐτόν, καὶ ἐπιπεσεῖται ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς
φόβος, καὶ φεύξονται ἀπὸ προσώπου ὑμῶν. Καὶ ἐπακολουθήσαν- 4

#### CHAPTER 13

**14** but He hath crushed our enemies by my hand this night.”
**15** And approaching, she showed forth the head from the bag, and [behold] Assyria! And behold, the head of Holofernes, the chief captain of the army of Assyria! And behold, his canopy, wherein he lay in his dark draperies, and the Lord smote him by the hand of a woman.
**16** As the Lord liveth, who hath preserved me in the way which I went, for my face did deceive him unto his destruction, and he committed no sin with me unto defilement and shame.”
**17** And all the people were exceedingly amazed, and bowing themselves down, they worshipped God, and said with one accord, “Blessed art Thou, O our God, who hast brought to nought this day the enemies of Thy people.”
**18** And Uzziah said unto her, “Blessed art thou, O daughter, by God Most High, above all women that are upon the earth; and blessed be the Lord God, who created the heavens and the earth, who hath directed thee to the wounding of the head of the ruler of our enemies.
**19** For thy hope shall not depart from the heart of men remembering the strength of God unto eternity.
**20** And God shall make these things unto thee for an everlasting exaltation, that He may visit thee with good things; for thou sparedst not thy soul on account of the humiliation of our race, but didst go forth against our downfall, walking uprightly before our God.” And all the people said, “So be it, so be it!”

#### CHAPTER 14

**1** And Judith said unto them, “Hearken now unto me, my brethren, and taking this head, hang it upon the battlement of your wall.
**2** And it shall come to pass, when the morning doth dawn, and the sun ariseth upon the earth, each of you shall take up your war equipment, and every strong man shall go forth out of the city, and ye shall appoint a leader for them, as though going down to the plain for the vanguard of the sons of Assyria, but ye shall not go down.
**3** And these, having taken up their full armor, shall go into their camps, and shall rouse the generals of the army of Assyria, and they shall run together to the tent of Holofernes, and they shall not find him; and fear shall fall upon them, and they shall flee from your presence.
