ΚΕΦ. Ιϛ´.
Μανασσῆ· καὶ ἐπένθησαν αὐτὴν οἶκος ᾿Ισραὴλ ἡμέρας ἑπτά. καὶ
διεῖλε τὰ ὑπάρχοντα αὐτῆς πρὸ τοῦ ἀποθανεῖν αὐτὴν πᾶσι τοῖς
ἔγγιστα Μανασσῆ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς αὐτῆς, καὶ τοῖς ἔγγιστα τοῦ γέ-
νους αὐτῆς. Καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἔτι ὁ ἐκφοβῶν τοὺς υἱοὺς ᾿Ισραὴλ ἐν ταῖς
ἡμέραις ᾿Ιουδίθ, καὶ μετὰ τὸ ἀποθανεῖν αὐτήν, ἡμέρας πολλὰς.

Manasseh. And the house of Israel mourned her seven days. And she divided her possessions, before she died, unto all those nearest to Manasseh her husband, and unto those nearest of her own kin. And there was no longer any that did put the sons of Israel in fear, neither in the days of Judith, nor for many days after she died.
