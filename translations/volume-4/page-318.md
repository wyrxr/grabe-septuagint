ἄγγελος αὐτοῦ. Ἐποίησε γὰρ Ἑζεκίας τὸ ἀρεστὸν Κυρίῳ, καὶ ἐνίσχυσεν ἐν ὁδοῖς Δαυὶδ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ, ἃς ἐνετείλατο Ἡσαΐας ὁ προφήτης, ὁ μέγας καὶ πιστὸς ἐν ὁράσει αὐτοῦ.
23 Ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις αὐτοῦ ἀνεπόδισεν ὁ ἥλιος, καὶ προσέθηκε ζωὴν βασιλεῖ.
24 Πνεύματι μεγάλῳ εἶδε τὰ ἔσχατα, καὶ παρεκάλεσε τοὺς πενθοῦντας ἐν Σιών·
25 ἕως τοῦ αἰῶνος ὑπέδειξε τὰ ἐσόμενα, καὶ τὰ ἀπόκρυφα πρὶν παραγενέσθαι αὐτά.

ΚΕΦ. ΜΘ'. XLIX.
1 Μνημόσυνον Ἰωσίου εἰς σύνθεσιν θυμιάματος, ἐσκευασμένον ἔργον μυρεψοῦ· ἐν παντὶ στόματι ὡς μέλι γλυκανθήσεται, καὶ ὡς μουσικὰ ἐν συμποσίῳ οἴνου.
2 Αὐτὸς κατηυθύνθη ἐν ἐπιστροφῇ λαοῦ, καὶ ἐξῆρε βδελύγματα ἀνομίας·
3 Κατεύθυνε πρὸς Κύριον τὴν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ, ἐν ἡμέραις ἀνόμων κατίσχυσε τὴν εὐσέβειαν.
4 Πάρεξ Δαυίδ, καὶ Ἑζεκίου, καὶ Ἰωσίου, πάντες πλημμελείᾳ ἐπλημμέλησαν· κατέλειπον γὰρ τὸν νόμον τοῦ Ὑψίστου, οἱ βασιλεῖς Ἰούδα ἐξέλειπον.
5 Ἔδωκεν γὰρ τὸ κέρας αὐτῶν ἑτέροις, καὶ τὴν δόξαν αὐτῶν ἔθνει ἀλλοτρίῳ·
6 Ἐνεπύρισαν ἐκλεκτὴν πόλιν ἁγιάσματος, καὶ ἠρήμωσαν τὰς ὁδοὺς αὐτῆς ἐν χειρὶ Ἱερεμίου.
7 Ἐκάκοσαν γὰρ αὐτόν, καὶ αὐτὸς ἐν μήτρᾳ ἡγιάσθη προφήτης ἐκριζοῦν καὶ κακοῦν καὶ ἀπολύειν, ὡσαύτως οἰκοδομεῖν καὶ καταφυτεύειν.
8 Ἰεζεκήλος ἴδεν ὅρασιν δόξης, ἣν ὑπέδειξεν αὐτῷ ἐπὶ ἅρματος Χερουβείμ·
9 Καὶ γὰρ ἐμνήσθη τῶν ἐχθρῶν ἐν ὄμβρῳ, καὶ ἀγαθῶσαι τοὺς εὐθύνοντας ὁδοὺς.
10 Καὶ τῶν δώδεκα προφητῶν τὰ ὀστᾶ ἀναθάλλοι ἐκ τοῦ τόπου αὐτῶν· παρεκάλεσαν γὰρ τὸν Ἰακώβ, καὶ ἐλυτρώσαντο αὐτοὺς ἐν πίστει ἐλπίδος.
11 Πῶς μεγαλύνωμεν τὸν Ζοροβάβελ ; καὶ αὐτὸς ὡς σφραγὶς ἐπὶ δεξιᾶς χειρός·
12 Οὕτως Ἰησοῦς υἱὸς Ἰωσεδέκ, οἱ ἐν ἡμέραις αὐτῶν ᾠκοδόμησαν οἶκον, καὶ ἀνύψωσαν ναὸν ἅγιον Κυρίῳ, ἡτοιμασμένον εἰς δόξαν αἰῶνος.
13 Καὶ ἐν ἐκλεκτοῖς ἦν Νεεμίας, οὗ ἐπὶ πολὺ τὸ μνημόσυνον, τοῦ ἐγείραντος ἡμῖν τείχη πεπτωκότα, καὶ στήσαντος πύλας καὶ μοχλούς, καὶ ἀνεγείραντος τὰ οἰκόπεδα ἡμῶν.
14 Οὐδ᾽ εἷς ἐκτίσθη ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς τοιοῦτος οἷος Ἑνώχ· καὶ αὐτὸς ἀνελήφθη ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς.
15 Οὐδὲ ὡς Ἰωσὴφ ἐγενήθη ἀνήρ, ἡγούμενος ἀδελφῶν, στήριγμα λαοῦ, καὶ τὰ ὀστᾶ αὐτοῦ ἐπεσκέπησαν.
16 Σὴμ καὶ Σήθ ἐν ἀνθρώποις ἐδοξάσθησαν, καὶ ὑπὲρ πᾶν ζῶον ἐν τῇ κτίσει Ἀδάμ.

**Chapter Forty-Eight**

...his angel did destroy them.
22 For Hezekiah did that which was pleasing unto the Lord,
and strengthened himself in the ways of David his father,
which Isaiah the prophet, great and faithful in his vision, had commanded.
23 In his days the sun did turn back,
and [the Lord] added life unto the king.
24 With a great spirit did he see the last things,
and comforted those who mourned in Zion;
25 Unto the [end of the] age did he show forth the things that were to come,
and the hidden things ere they came to pass.

**Chapter Forty-Nine**

1 The memorial of Josiah is as a composition of incense,
prepared by the skillful work of a perfumer;
in every mouth shall it be sweetened as honey,
and as music at a banquet of wine.
2 He himself was rightly guided in the turning back of the people,
and removed the abominations of iniquity.
3 He directed his heart toward the Lord,
and in the days of the lawless he did strengthen piety.
4 Save for David, and Hezekiah, and Josiah,
all did commit grievous transgressions;
for they forsook the law of the Most High,
and the kings of Judah did perish.
5 For they gave their horn to others,
and their glory unto a foreign nation;
6 They burned the chosen city of the sanctuary,
and made her ways desolate by the hand of Jeremiah.
7 For they dealt ill with him,
and he himself was sanctified as a prophet in the womb,
to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy,
and likewise to build and to plant.
8 Ezekiel saw a vision of glory,
which He showed unto him upon the chariot of the Cherubim.
9 For he made mention of the enemies in a storm,
and to do good unto them that straighten their ways.
10 And may the bones of the twelve prophets blossom from their place;
for they comforted Jacob,
and delivered them by [the] faith of hope.
11 How shall we magnify Zerubbabel?
And he was as a seal upon the right hand.
12 So also Joshua the son of Josedek,
they in their days built a house,
and raised up a holy temple unto the Lord,
prepared for glory everlasting.
13 And among the chosen was Nehemiah,
whose remembrance is great indeed,
he who raised up for us the fallen walls,
and set up gates and bars,
and rebuilt our dwellings.
14 Neither was one created upon the earth such as Enoch,
and he himself was taken up from the earth.
15 Neither was there born a man like Joseph,
a leader of brethren, a support of the people,
and his bones were covered.
16 Shem and Seth were glorified among men,
and above every living creature in the creation of Adam.
