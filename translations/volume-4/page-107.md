**ΚΕΦ. Θʹ. ΜΑΚΚΑΒΑΙΩΝ Αʹ. 1638**
29 [φί]λοι Ἰούδου, καὶ εἶπον τῷ Ἰωνάθαν· Ἀφ’ οὗ ὁ ἀδελφός σου Ἰούδας τετελεύτηκε, καὶ ἀνὴρ ὅμοιος αὐτῷ οὐκ ἔστιν ἐξελθεῖν πρὸς τοὺς ἐχθροὺς καὶ Βακχίδην, καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἐχθραίνουσι τοῦ ἔθνους
30 ἡμῶν. Νῦν οὖν σε ᾑρετισάμεθα σήμερον, τοῦ εἶναι ἀντ’ αὐτοῦ ἡμῖν εἰς ἄρχοντα καὶ ἡγούμενον, τοῦ πολεμῆσαι τὸν πόλεμον
31 ἡμῶν. Καὶ ἐπεδέξατο Ἰωνάθαν ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ τὴν ἡγησιν,
32 καὶ ἀνέστη ἀντὶ Ἰούδου τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἔγνω Βακχίδης,
33 καὶ ἐζήτει αὐτὸν ἀποκτεῖναι. Καὶ ἔγνω Ἰωνάθαν καὶ Σίμων ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ πάντες οἱ μετ’ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔφυγον εἰς τὴν ἔρημον Θεκωὲ, καὶ παρενέβαλον ἐπὶ τὸ ὕδωρ λάκκου Ἀσφάρ.
34 Καὶ ἔγνω Βακχίδης τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῶν σαββάτων, καὶ ἦλθεν αὐτὸς καὶ πᾶν τὸ στράτευμα αὐτοῦ πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου.
35 Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ἰωνάθαν τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ ἡγούμενον τοῦ ὄχλου· καὶ παρεκάλεσε τοὺς Ναβαταίους φίλους αὐτοῦ παραθέσθαι αὐτοῖς
36 τὴν ἀποσκευὴν αὐτῶν τὴν πολλήν. Καὶ ἐξῆλθον οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰαμβρεὶν ἐκ Μηδαβὰ, καὶ συνέλαβον Ἰωάννην καὶ πάντα ὅσα εἶχε,
37 καὶ ἀπῆλθον ἔχοντες. Μετὰ δὲ τοὺς λόγους τούτους ἀπηγγείλαν τῷ Ἰωνάθαν καὶ Σίμωνι τῷ ἀδελφῷ αὐτοῦ, ὅτι οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰαμβρεὶν ποιοῦσι γάμον μέγαν, καὶ ἄγουσι τὴν νύμφην ἀπὸ Ναδαβὰθ θυγατέρα ἑνὸς τῶν μεγάλων μεγιστάνων Χαναὰν μετὰ παραπομπῆς μεγάλης.
38 Καὶ ἐμνήσθησαν Ἰωάννου τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἀνέβησαν καὶ ἐκρύβησαν ὑπὸ τὴν σκέπην τοῦ ὄρους.
39 Καὶ ἦραν τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτῶν καὶ εἶδαν, καὶ ἰδοὺ θροῦς καὶ ἀποσκευὴ πολλή, καὶ ὁ νυμφίος ἐξῆλθε καὶ οἱ φίλοι αὐτοῦ καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτῶν μετὰ τυμπάνων καὶ μουσικῶν καὶ ὅπλων πολλῶν.
40 Καὶ ἐξανέστησαν ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ τοῦ ἐνέδρου οἱ περὶ τὸν Ἰωνάθαν, καὶ ἀπέκτειναν αὐτοὺς, καὶ ἔπεσαν τραυματίαι πολλοὶ, καὶ οἱ ἐπίλοιποι ἔφυγον εἰς τὸ ὄρος, καὶ ἔλαβον
41 πάντα τὰ σκῦλα αὐτῶν. Καὶ μετεστράφη ὁ γάμος εἰς πένθος,
42 καὶ ἡ φωνὴ μουσικῶν αὐτῶν εἰς θρῆνον. Καὶ ἐξεδίκησαν τὴν ἐκδίκησιν αἵματος ἀδελφοῦ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἀπέστρεψαν εἰς τὸ ἔλος τοῦ
43 Ἰορδάνου. Καὶ ἤκουσε Βακχίδης, καὶ ἦλθε τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῶν σαββάτων ἕως τῶν κρηπίδων τοῦ Ἰορδάνου ἐν δυνάμει πολλῇ.
44 Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰωνάθαν τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς αὐτοῦ· ἀναστῶμεν νῦν καὶ πολεμήσωμεν ὑπὲρ τῶν ψυχῶν ἡμῶν· οὐ γὰρ ἔστι σήμερον ὡς ἐχθὲς
44 καὶ τρίτην ἡμέραν.
45 Ἰδοὺ γὰρ ὁ πόλεμος ἐξεναντίας ἡμῶν καὶ

**9:29** ...of Judas, and they spake unto Jonathan, saying, “Since thy brother Judas is deceased, and there is no man like unto him to go forth against the foes and Bacchides, and against those who are enemies unto our nation.
**30** Therefore, we have chosen thee this day, that thou shouldest be in his stead our ruler and leader, to wage our war.”
**31** And Jonathan accepted the leadership in that season,
**32** and he rose up in the stead of Judas his brother. And Bacchides knew [of it],
**33** and sought to slay him. And Jonathan and Simon his brother, and all those with him, perceived [this], and they fled into the wilderness of Tekoa, and encamped by the water of the pit called Asphar.
**34** And Bacchides knew [their whereabouts] on the day of the sabbath, and he came, himself and all his army, beyond the Jordan.
**35** And Jonathan sent his brother as leader of the multitude; and he called upon the Nabataeans, his friends, that they should keep safe for them their much baggage.
**36** And the sons of Jambri came forth from Medaba, and they seized John and all that he had, and departed, taking [it] with them.
**37** Now after these things, it was reported unto Jonathan and Simon his brother, that the sons of Jambri were making a great marriage-feast, and were bringing the bride from Nadabath, the daughter of one of the great chief men of Canaan, with a great retinue.
**38** And they remembered John their brother, and went up and hid themselves beneath the covert of the mountain.
**39** And they lifted up their eyes and looked, and behold, a tumult and much baggage, and the bridegroom came forth, and his friends and his brethren, to meet them, with timbrels and musical instruments and many weapons.
**40** And those with Jonathan rose up against them from the ambush, and slew them, and many wounded men fell, and the rest fled unto the mountain, and they took all their spoils.
**41** And the marriage-feast was turned into mourning,
**42** and the sound of their music into lamentation. And they avenged the blood of their brother, and returned unto the fen of the Jordan.
**43** And Bacchides heard [thereof], and he came on the day of the sabbath unto the banks of the Jordan with a great force.
**44** And Jonathan said unto his brethren, “Let us now rise up and fight for our lives; for this day is not as yesterday and the third day [past].
**45** For behold, the battle is before us and behind us;
