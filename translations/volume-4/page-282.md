ΚΕΦ. ΚΑ΄. ΚΒ΄. ΙΗΣΟΥ ΥΙΟΥ ΣΙΡΑΧ
φλὸξ πυρός. Ὁδὸς ἁμαρτωλῶν ὡμαλισμένη ἐκ λίθων, καὶ ἐπ᾿ ἐσχάτων αὐτῆς βόθρος ᾅδου. Ὁ φυλάσσων νόμον Κυρίου, κατακρατεῖ τοῦ ἐννοήματος αὐτοῦ· καὶ συντέλεια τοῦ φόβου Κυρίου σοφία. Οὐ παιδευθήσεται ὃς οὐκ ἔστι πανοῦργος· ἔστι δὲ πανουργία πληθύνουσα πικρίαν. Γνῶσις σοφοῦ ὡς κατακλυσμὸς πληθυνθήσεται, καὶ ἡ βουλὴ αὐτοῦ ὡς πηγὴ ἁγνὴ ζωῆς. Ἔγκατα μωροῦ ὡς ἀγγεῖον συντετριμμένον, καὶ πᾶσαν γνῶσιν οὐ κρατήσει ἐν ζωῇ αὐτοῦ. Λόγον σοφὸν ἐὰν ἀκούσῃ ἐπιστήμων, αἰνέσει αὐτόν, καὶ ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν προσθήσει· ἤκουσεν ὁ σπαταλῶν, καὶ ἀπήρεσεν αὐτῷ, καὶ ἀπέστρεψεν αὐτὸν ὀπίσω τοῦ νώτου αὐτοῦ. Ἔξηγησις μωροῦ ὡς ἐν ὁδῷ φορτίον· ἐπὶ δὲ χείλους συνετοῦ εὑρεθήσεται χάρις. Στόμα φρονίμου ζητηθήσεται ἐν ἐκκλησίᾳ, καὶ τοὺς λόγους αὐτοῦ διανοηθήσονται ἐν καρδίᾳ. Ὡς οἶκος ἠφανισμένος οὕτως μωρῷ σοφίᾳ, καὶ γνῶσις ἀσυνέτου ἀδιεξέταστοι λόγοι. Πέδαι ἐν ποσὶν ἀνοήτοις παιδεία, καὶ ὡς χειροπέδαι ἐπὶ χειρὸς δεξιᾶς. Μωρὸς ἐν γέλωτι ἀνυψοῖ τὴν φωνὴν αὐτοῦ· ἀνὴρ δὲ πανοῦργος μόλις ἡσυχῇ μειδιάσει. Ὡς κόσμος χρυσούς φρονίμῳ παιδεία, καὶ ὡς χλιδὼν ἐπὶ βραχίονι δεξιῷ. Ποὺς μωροῦ ταχὺς εἰς οἰκίαν, ἄνθρωπος δὲ πολύπειρος αἰσχυνθήσεται ἀπὸ προσώπου. Ἄφρων ἀπὸ θύρας παρακύπτει εἰς οἰκίαν· ἀνὴρ δὲ πεπαιδευμένος ἔξω στήσεται. Ἀπαιδευσία ἀνθρώπου ἀκροᾶσθαι παρὰ θύραν· ὁ δὲ φρόνιμος βαρυνθήσεται ἀτιμίᾳ. Χείλη πολυλάλων τὰ οὐκ αὐτῶν διηγήσονται· λόγοι δὲ φρονίμων ἐν ζυγῷ σταθήσονται. Ἐν στόματι μωρῶν ἡ καρδία αὐτῶν, ἐν καρδίᾳ δὲ φρονίμων στόμα αὐτῶν. Ἐν τῷ καταράσασθαι ἀσεβῆ τὸν Σατανᾶν, αὐτὸς καταρᾶται τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ. Μολύνει τὴν ἑαυτοῦ ψυχὴν ὁ ψιθυρίζων, καὶ ἐν παροικήσει μισήθήσεται.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΒ΄. ΧΧΙΙ.

Λίθῳ ἡδραλωμένῳ συνελήφθη ὀκνηρός, καὶ πᾶς ἐκσυριεῖ ἐπὶ τῇ ἀτιμίᾳ αὐτοῦ· βολβίτῳ κοπρίῳ συνελήφθη ὀκνηρός, πᾶς ὁ ἀναιρούμενος αὐτὸν ἐκτινάξει χεῖρα. Αἰσχύνη πατρὸς ἐν γεννήσει ἀπαιδεύτου, θυγάτηρ δὲ ἐπ᾿ ἐλαττώσει γίνεται. Θυγάτηρ φρόνιμη κληρονομήσει ἄνδρα αὐτῆς, καὶ ἡ καταισχύνουσα, εἰς λύπην γεννήσαντος· πατέρα καὶ ἄνδρα καταισχύνει ἡ θρασεῖα, καὶ ὑπὸ

**Chapter Twenty-One**

9 Gathered tow is the assembly of the lawless,
and their consummation [is as] a flame of fire.
10 The path of sinners is made smooth with stones,
but at the end thereof is the pit of Hades.
11 He that keeps the Law of the Lord shall master his own understanding;
and the consummation of the fear of the Lord is wisdom.
12 He that is not taught shall not be cunning;
but there is a cunning that multiplies bitterness.
13 The knowledge of the wise shall be multiplied as a flood,
and his counsel as a pure fountain of life.
14 The inwards of a fool are as a broken vessel,
and he shall not retain all knowledge in his life.
15 If a man of understanding hears a wise saying,
he shall praise it and add unto it;
but he that is wasteful, when he has heard it, it displeases him,
and he turns it behind his back.
16 The explanation of a fool is as a burden on the way;
but upon the lips of a man of understanding shall grace be found.
17 The mouth of a prudent man shall be sought in the assembly,
and his words shall be pondered in the heart.
18 As a house laid waste, so is wisdom to a fool;
and the knowledge of the unintelligent are words that cannot be examined.
19 Fetters upon the feet of the unwise is instruction,
and as manacles upon the right hand.
20 A fool in his laughter raises his voice;
but a prudent man shall scarcely smile quietly.
21 As an ornament of gold is instruction to a prudent man,
and as a bracelet upon the right arm.
22 The foot of a fool is swift to a house,
but a man of much experience shall be ashamed before the face [of another].
23 An imbecile peers into a house from the door;
but a man who is well-taught shall stand without.
24 The lack of instruction in a man is to listen by the door;
but the man of prudence shall be burdened with dishonor.
25 The lips of those who speak much shall tell things not their own;
but the words of the prudent shall be weighed in a balance.
26 In the mouth of fools is their heart,
but in the heart of the prudent is their mouth.
27 When an ungodly man curses Satan,
he himself curses his own soul.
28 He that whispers pollutes his own soul,
and in his sojourning shall be hated.

**Chapter Twenty-Two**

1 The sluggard is caught as with a stone that sticks fast,
and every man shall hiss at his dishonor.
2 The sluggard is caught as with dung of an ox,
and every man that removes him shall shake off his hand.
3 The shame of a father is in the birth of an untaught [son],
but a daughter becomes [a cause] of lessening.
4 A prudent daughter shall inherit her husband,
but she that brings shame brings sorrow to her father.
5 A bold daughter shames both father and husband,
and by both shall she be dishonored.
