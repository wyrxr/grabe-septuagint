22 στράτευμα. Τάξας καὶ τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ προηγουμένους ἑκα-
23 τέρας τάξεως Σίμωνα καὶ Ἰώσηπον καὶ Ἰωνάθην, ὑποτάξας ἑ-
24 κάστῳ χιλίους πρὸς τοὺς πεντοκοσίους, ἔτι δὲ καὶ Ἐλεάζαρον,
παραναγνοὺς τὴν ἱερὰν βίβλον, καὶ δοὺς σύνθημα Θεοῦ βοηθείας,
τῆς πρώτης σπείρας αὐτοὺς προηγουμένους συνέβαλε τῷ Νικάνορι.
25 Γενομένου δὲ αὐτοῖς τοῦ παντοκράτορος συμμάχου κατέσφαξαν
τῶν πολεμίων ὑπὲρ τοὺς ἐννακισχιλίους, τραυματίας δὲ καὶ τοῖς
μέλεσιν ἀναπήρους τὸ πλεῖον μέρος τῆς τοῦ Νικάνορος στρατιᾶς
26 ἐποίησαν, πάντας δὲ φεύγειν ἠνάγκασαν. Τὰ δὲ χρήματα τῶν
παραγενομένων ἐπὶ τὸν ἀγορασμὸν αὐτῶν ἔλαβον· συνδιώξαντες
27 δὲ αὐτοὺς ἐπ᾿ ἱκανὸν ἀνέλυσαν ὑπὸ τῆς ὥρας συγκλειόμενοι. Ἦν
γὰρ ἡ πρὸ τοῦ σαββάτου δίκη, δι᾿ ἣν αἰτίαν οὐκ ἐμακροτόνησαν
28 κατατρέχοντες αὐτούς. Ἀπολογησάμενοι δὲ αὐτοὺς καὶ τὰ σκῦ-
λα ἐκδύσαντες τῶν πολεμίων περὶ τὸ σάββατον ἐγίνοντο περισσῶς
εὐλογοῦντες καὶ ἐξομολογούμενοι τῷ Κυρίῳ τῷ διασώσαντι αὐ-
29 τοὺς εἰς τὴν ἡμέραν ταύτην, ἀρχὴν ἐλέους τάξαντος αὐτοῖς. Με-
τὰ δὲ τὸ σάββατον τοῖς ἠκισμένοις καὶ ταῖς χήραις καὶ τοῖς ὀρ-
φανοῖς μερίσαντες ἀπὸ τῶν σκύλων, τὰ λοιπὰ αὐτοὶ καὶ τὰ παι-
30 δία διεμερίσαντο. Ταῦτα δὲ διαπραξάμενοι, καὶ κοινὴν ἱκετείαν
ποιησάμενοι, τὸν ἐλεήμονα Κύριον ἠξίουν εἰς τέλος καταλλαγῆ-
31 ναι τοῖς αὐτοῦ δούλοις. Καὶ τοῖς περὶ Τιμόθεον καὶ Βακχίδην συνε-
ρίσαντες ὑπὲρ τοὺς δισμυρίους αὐτῶν ἀνεῖλον, καὶ ὀχυρωμάτων
ὑψηλῶν εὖ μάλα ἐγκρατεῖς ἐγένοντο, καὶ λάφυρα πλεῖστα ἐμε-
ρίσαντο, ἰσούρους ἑαυτοῖς καὶ τοῖς ἠκισμένοις καὶ ὀρφανοῖς
32 καὶ χήραις ἔτι δὲ καὶ πρεσβυτέροις ποιήσαντες. Ἀπολογησά-
μενοι δὲ αὐτοὺς ἐπιμελῶς πάντα συνέθηκαν εἰς τοὺς ἐπικαίρους τό-
33 πους, τὰ δὲ λοιπὰ τῶν σκύλων ἤνεγκαν εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα. Τῶν δὲ
φύλαρχην τῶν περὶ Τιμόθεον ἀνεῖλον ἀνοσιώτατον ἄνδρα καὶ πολ-
34 λὰ τοὺς Ἰουδαίους ἐπιλελυπηκότα. Ἐπινίκια δὲ ἄγοντες ἐν τῇ
πατρίδι, τοὺς ἐμπρήσαντας τοὺς ἱεροὺς πύλωνας Καλλισθένην καὶ
τινας ἄλλους ὑφῆψαν εἰς ἕν οἰκίδιον πεφυγάτας, οἵ τινες ἄξιον
35 τῆς δυσσεβείας ἐκομίσατο μισθόν. Ὁ δὲ τρισαλιτήριος Νικάνωρ,
ὁ τοὺς χιλίους ἐμπόρους ἐπὶ τὴν πρᾶσιν τῶν Ἰουδαίων ἀγα-
36 γών, ταπεινωθεὶς ὑπὸ τῶν κατ᾿ αὐτὸν νομιζομένων ἐλαχίστων εἶ-
ναι, τῇ τοῦ Κυρίου βοηθείᾳ τὴν δοξικὴν ἀποθέμενος ἐσθῆτα, διὰ
37 τῆς μεσογείου δραπέτου τρόπον ἔρημον ἑαυτὸν ποιήσας, ἧκεν εἰς

**22** He divided the army into four parts. And having appointed his brothers, Simon, and Joseph, and Jonathan, to be the leaders of each division, setting under each one thousand and five hundred [men], and furthermore, Eleazar; **24** and having read aloud the sacred book, and given the watchword, 'God's help,' he joined battle with Nicanor, they leading the first company.

**25** Now when the Almighty became their ally, they slew of their enemies above nine thousand; and the greater part of Nicanor’s army they made wounded and crippled in their limbs, **26** and compelled all to flee. And the money of them that came to purchase them they took. But having pursued them for a sufficient while, they withdrew, being constrained by the hour. **27** For it was the judgment before the Sabbath, for which cause they did not prolong their pursuit of them.

**28** Now when they had accounted for them, and stripped the spoils from their enemies, they were about the Sabbath, exceedingly blessing and giving thanks unto the Lord, Who had preserved them unto this day, **29** having appointed unto them a beginning of mercy. But after the Sabbath, having distributed of the spoils unto them that had been ill-treated, and unto the widows, and unto the orphans, they themselves and their children divided the rest. **30** And having accomplished these things, and made a common supplication, they implored the merciful Lord to be fully reconciled unto His servants.

**31** And having contended with those that were with Timothy and Bacchides, they slew of them above twenty thousand, and became very well masters of high strongholds, and divided a great amount of spoils, **32** making equal shares for themselves and for them that had been ill-treated, and for orphans, and for widows, and furthermore, for the elders. Now having accounted for them, they carefully laid up all things in suitable places, **33** and the rest of the spoils they brought unto Jerusalem.

Moreover, they slew the tribal chief of those that were with Timothy, a most impious man, who had greatly distressed the Jews. **34** And holding celebrations of victory in their homeland, they set on fire Callisthenes and certain others, who had burned the sacred gates and fled into a small house; **35** and these received a reward worthy of their impiety.

Now the thrice-accursed Nicanor, who had brought the thousand merchants for the sale of the Jews, **36** being humbled by those whom he reckoned as the least, by the help of the Lord, cast off his pompous attire, **37** and making himself as a deserted fugitive through the inland regions, he came unto...
