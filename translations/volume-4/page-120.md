ΚΑΙ ἴδεν Ἰωνάθαν ὅτι ὁ καιρὸς αὐτῷ συνεργεῖ, καὶ ἐπέλεξεν 1
ἄνδρας, καὶ ἀπέστειλεν εἰς Ῥώμην στῆσαι καὶ ἀνανεῶσαι
τὴν πρὸς αὐτοὺς φιλίαν. Καὶ πρὸς Σπαρτιάτας, καὶ τόπους ἑτέρους 2
ἀπέστειλεν ἐπιστολὰς κατὰ ταῦτα. Καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν εἰς 3
Ῥώμην, καὶ εἰσῆλθον εἰς τὸ βουλευτήριον, καὶ εἶπαν· Ἰωνάθαν ὁ
ἀρχιερεὺς καὶ τὸ ἔθνος τῶν Ἰουδαίων ἀπέστειλεν ἡμᾶς ἀνανεώσασθαι
τὴν φιλίαν αὐτοῖς καὶ τὴν συμμαχίαν κατὰ τὸ πρότερον.
Καὶ ἔδωκαν ἐπιστολὰς αὐτοῖς πρὸς αὐτοὺς κατὰ τόπον, ὅπως 4
προπέμπωσιν αὐτοὺς εἰς γῆν Ἰούδα μετ᾽ εἰρήνης. Καὶ τοῦτο ἀντίγραφον 5
τῶν ἐπιστολῶν ὧν ἔγραψεν Ἰωνάθαν τοῖς Σπαρτιάταις.
Ἰωνάθαν ἀρχιερεὺς (τοῦ ἔθνους) καὶ ἡ γερουσία τοῦ ἔθνους, καὶ οἱ 6
ἱερεῖς, καὶ ὁ λοιπὸς δῆμος τῶν Ἰουδαίων Σπαρτιάταις τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς
χαίρειν. Ἔτι πρότερον ἐπεστάλησαν ἐπιστολαὶ πρὸς Ὀνίαν 7
τὸν ἀρχιερέα παρὰ Δαρείου τοῦ βασιλέως· ἔντος ἐν ὑμῖν, ἔτι ἐστὲ ἀδελφοὶ
ἡμῶν, ὡς τὸ ἀντίγραφον ὑπόκειται. Καὶ ἐπεδέξατο Ὀνίας 8
τὸν ἄνδρα τὸν ἀπεσταλμένον ἐνδόξως, καὶ ἔλαβε τὰς ἐπιστολάς, ἐν
αἷς διεσάφειτο περὶ συμμαχίας καὶ φιλίας. Καὶ ἡμεῖς οὖν ἀπροσδεεῖς 9
τούτων ὄντες, παράκλησιν ἔχοντες τὰ βιβλία τὰ ἅγια τὰ
ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν ἡμῶν, ἐπειράθημεν ἀποστεῖλαι τὴν πρὸς ἡμᾶς 10
ἀδελφότητα, καὶ φιλίαν ἀνανεώσασθαι πρὸς τὸ μὴ ἐξαλλοτριωθῆναι
ὑμῶν· πολλοὶ γὰρ καιροὶ διῆλθον ἀφ᾽ οὗ ἀπεστείλατε πρὸς
ἡμᾶς. Ἡμεῖς οὖν ἐν παντὶ καιρῷ ἀδιαλείπτως ἐν ταῖς ἑορταῖς 11
καὶ ἐν ταῖς λοιπαῖς καθηκούσαις ἡμέραις μιμνησκόμεθα ὑμῶν, ἐφ᾽
ὧν προσφέρομεν θυσιῶν, καὶ ἐν ταῖς προσευχαῖς, ὡς δέον ἐστὶ
καὶ πρέπον μνημονεύειν ἀδελφῶν. Εὐφραινόμεθα δὲ ἐπὶ τῇ δόξῃ ὑμῶν. 12
Ἡμᾶς δὲ ἐκύκλωσαν πολλαὶ θλίψεις καὶ πόλεμοι πολλοί, 13
καὶ ἐπολέμησαν ἡμᾶς οἱ βασιλεῖς οἱ κύκλῳ ἡμῶν. Οὐκ ἠβουλόμεθα 14
οὖν παρενοχλεῖν ὑμῖν καὶ τοῖς λοιποῖς συμμάχοις καὶ
φίλοις ἡμῶν ἐν τοῖς πολέμοις τούτοις. Ἔχομεν γὰρ τὴν ἐξ οὐρανῶν 15
βοήθειαν βοηθοῦσαν ἡμῖν, καὶ ἐρύσθημεν ἀπὸ τῶν ἐχθρῶν
ἡμῶν, καὶ ἐταπεινώθησαν οἱ ἐχθροὶ ἡμῶν. Ἐπελέξαμεν οὖν 16
Νουμήνιον Ἀντιόχου καὶ Ἀντίπατρον Ἰάσωνος, καὶ ἀπεστάλκαμεν
πρὸς Ῥωμαίους ἀνανεώσασθαι τὴν πρὸς αὐτοὺς φιλίαν καὶ
