34. Καὶ ἔθηκαν ἐκεῖ ἔθνος ἁμαρτωλῶν, ἄνδρας παρανόμους,
35. καὶ ἐνίσχυσαν ἐν αὐτῇ. Καὶ παρέθεντο ὅπλα καὶ τροφήν, καὶ
36. συναγαγόντες τὰ σκῦλα Ἰερουσαλὴμ ἀπέθεντο ἐκεῖ. Καὶ ἐγένετο εἰς μεγάλην παγίδα, καὶ ἐγένετο εἰς ἔνεδρον τῷ ἁγιάσματι,
37. καὶ εἰς διάβολον πονηρὸν τῷ Ἰσραὴλ διαπαντός. Καὶ ἐξέχεαν αἷμα ἀθῴων κύκλῳ τοῦ ἁγιάσματος, καὶ ἐμόλυναν τὸ ἁγίασμα.
38. Καὶ ἔφυγον οἱ κάτοικοι Ἰερουσαλὴμ ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦς, καὶ ἐγένετο κατοικία ἀλλοτρίων· καὶ ἐγένετο ἀλλοτρία τοῖς γεννήμασιν αὐτῆς,
39. καὶ τὰ τέκνα αὐτῆς ἐγκατέλιπον αὐτήν. Τὸ ἁγίασμα αὐτῆς ἠρημώθη ὡς ἔρημος· αἱ ἑορταὶ αὐτῆς ἐστράφησαν εἰς πένθος, τὰ σάββατα
40. αὐτῆς εἰς ὀνειδισμόν, ἡ τιμὴ αὐτῆς εἰς ἐξουδένωσιν, κατὰ τὴν δόξαν αὐτῆς ἐπληθύνθη ἀτιμασμὸς αὐτῆς, καὶ τὸ ὕψος αὐτῆς ἐστράφη εἰς πένθος.
41. Καὶ ἔγραψεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἀντίοχος πάσῃ τῇ βασιλείᾳ αὐτοῦ εἶναι πάντας εἰς λαὸν ἕνα, καὶ ἐγκαταλιπεῖν ἕκαστον
42. τὰ νόμιμα αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐπεδέξαντο πάντα τὰ ἔθνη κατὰ τὸν λόγον τοῦ βασιλέως.
43. Καὶ πολλοὶ ἀπὸ Ἰσραὴλ ηὐδόκησαν τῇ λατρείᾳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔθυσαν τοῖς εἰδώλοις, καὶ ἐβεβήλωσαν τὸ σάββατον.
44. Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ὁ βασιλεὺς βιβλία ἐν χειρὶ ἀγγέλων εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ καὶ τὰς πόλεις Ἰούδα, πορευθῆναι ὀπίσω νομίμων
45. ἀλλοτρίων τῆς γῆς. Καὶ κωλύσαι ὁλοκαυτώματα καὶ θυσίας καὶ σπονδὴν ἐκ τοῦ ἁγιάσματος, καὶ βεβηλῶσαι σάββατα καὶ ἑορτάς,
46. καὶ μιᾶναι ἁγίασμα καὶ ἁγίους, οἰκοδομῆσαι βωμοὺς καὶ τεμένη,
47. καὶ εἰδωλεῖα, καὶ θύειν θείας, καὶ κτήνη κοινά. Καὶ ἀφιέναι τοὺς
48. υἱοὺς αὐτῶν ἀπεριτμήτους, βδελύξαι τὰς ψυχὰς αὐτῶν ἐν παντὶ ἀκαθάρτῳ καὶ βεβηλώσει, ὥστε ἐπιλαθέσθαι τοῦ νόμου, καὶ ἀλλάξαι πάντα τὰ δικαιώματα.
49. Καὶ ὃς ἂν μὴ ποιήσῃ κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦ βασιλέως ἀποθανεῖται.
50. Κατὰ πάντας τοὺς λόγους τούτους ἔγραψε πάσῃ τῇ βασιλείᾳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐποίησεν ἐπισκόπους ἐπὶ
51. πάντα τὸν λαόν· καὶ ἐνετείλατο ταῖς πόλεσιν Ἰούδα θυσιάζειν κατὰ πόλιν καὶ πόλιν.
52. Καὶ συνηθροίσθησαν ἀπὸ τοῦ λαοῦ πρὸς αὐτοὺς πολλοί· πᾶς δ᾽ ἐγκαταλελοιπὼν τὸν νόμον· καὶ ἐποίησαν κακὰ ἐν τῇ γῇ, καὶ ἔθεντο τὸν Ἰσραὴλ ἐν κρυφίοις ἐν παντὶ φυγαδευτηρίῳ αὐτῶν.
53. Καὶ τῇ πεντεκαιδεκάτῃ ἡμέρᾳ Χασελεῦ τῷ πέμπτῳ καὶ τεσσαρακοστῷ καὶ ἑκατοστῷ ἔτει ᾠκοδόμησαν βδέλυγμα ἐρημώσεως ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον·
54. καὶ ἐν πόλεσιν Ἰούδα κύκλῳ ᾠκοδόμησαν βωμούς. Καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν θυρίδων τῶν οἰκιῶν, καὶ
55. ἐν ταῖς πλατείαις ἐθυμίων.

**34** And they set there a people of sinners, men lawless,
**35** and fortified it. And they laid up therein arms and provisions,
**36** and having gathered the spoils of Jerusalem, they laid them up there. And it became a great snare, and a lurking place for the sanctuary,
**37** yea, and an evil adversary unto Israel continually. And they shed the blood of innocents round about the sanctuary, and defiled the holy place.
**38** Then the inhabitants of Jerusalem fled from them; and it became a habitation for strangers; and she became estranged unto her own offspring,
**39** and her children abandoned her. Her sanctuary was laid waste as a wilderness; her feasts were turned into lamentation, her Sabbaths
**40** into a reproach, her honor into contempt. For according to her former glory was her dishonor multiplied, and her high estate was turned into lamentation.

**41** Moreover, King Antiochus wrote unto all his kingdom, that all should be one people,
**42** and that each man should forsake his own laws. And all the nations consented according to the word of the king.
**43** And many also from Israel were well pleased with his worship, and sacrificed unto idols, and profaned the Sabbath.
**44** Then the king sent letters by the hand of messengers unto Jerusalem and unto the cities of Judah, commanding them to walk after the strange laws
**45** of the land. And to forbid burnt offerings and sacrifices and drink offerings in the sanctuary, and to profane the Sabbaths and holy days,
**46** and to defile the sanctuary and holy persons, and to build altars and groves,
**47** and idol temples, and to sacrifice divine [offerings], and unclean beasts. And to leave their
**48** sons uncircumcised, and to defile their souls with all manner of uncleanness and profanation, so that they should forget the Law, and alter all the ordinances [thereof].
**49** And whosoever should not do according to the word of the king, should die.
**50** And according to all these words, he wrote unto all his kingdom, and appointed overseers over
**51** all the people; and he commanded the cities of Judah to sacrifice, city by city.
**52** Then many of the people gathered themselves unto them, even every man that had forsaken the Law. And they wrought great evils in the land, and put Israel to hide themselves in every secret place of theirs.
**53** And on the fifteenth day of the month of Chislev, in the one hundred and forty-fifth year, they built upon the altar an abomination of desolation;
**54** and in the cities of Judah round about, they built altars. And upon the windows of the houses, and
**55** in the streets they burned incense.
