**2 Maccabees Chapter 10**

**8** ἑαυτοῦ τόπον. Ἐδογμάτισαν τε μετὰ κοινοῦ προστάγματος καὶ ψηφίσματος παντὶ τῷ τῶν Ἰουδαίων ἔθνει κατ᾽ ἐνιαυτὸν ἄγειν τάςδε τὰς ἡμέρας.
**9** Καὶ τὰ μὲν τῆς Ἀντιόχου τοῦ προσαγορεθέντος Ἐπιφανοῦς τελευτῆς οὕτως εἶχε. Νυνὶ δὲ τὰ κατὰ τὸν
**10** Εὐπάτορα Ἀντίοχον, υἱὸν δὲ τοῦ ἀσεβοῦς γενόμενον δηλώσομεν,
**11** αὐτὰ συντέμνοντες τὰ συνέχοντα τῶν πολέμων κακά. Οὗτος γὰρ παραλαβὼν τὴν βασιλείαν, ἀνέδειξεν ἐπὶ τῶν προσταγμάτων Λυσίαν τινά, Κοίλης δὲ Συρίας, καὶ Φοινίκης στρατηγὸν πρωτάρχον.
**12** Πτολεμαῖος γὰρ ὁ καλούμενος Μάκρων τὸ δίκαιον συντηρῶν προηγούμενος πρὸς τοὺς Ἰουδαίους διὰ τὴν γεγονυῖαν εἰς αὐτοὺς ἀδικίαν, ἐπειρᾶτο τὰ πρὸς αὐτοὺς εἰρηνικῶς διεξάγειν.
**13** Ὅθεν κατηγορούμενος ὑπὸ τῶν φίλων πρὸς τὸν Εὐπάτορα, καὶ προδότης παρέκαστα ἀκούων, διὰ τὸ τὴν Κύπρον ἐμπιστευθέντα ὑπὸ τοῦ Φιλομήτορος ἐκλιπεῖν, καὶ πρὸς Ἀντίοχον τὸν Ἐπιφανῆ ἀναχωρῆσαι, μήτε εὐγενῆ ἐξουσίαν ἔχων, ὑπ᾽ ἀθυμίας φαρμακεύσας ἑαυτὸν ἐξέλιπε τὸν βίον.
**14** Γοργίας δὲ γενόμενος στρατηγὸς τῶν τόπων, ἐξενοτρόφει, καὶ παρέκαστα πρὸς τοὺς Ἰουδαίους ἐπολεμοτρόφει.
**15** Ὁμοῦ δὲ τούτῳ καὶ οἱ Ἰδουμαῖοι ἐγκρατεῖς ἐπικαίρων ὀχυρωμάτων ὄντες, ἐγύμναζον τοὺς Ἰουδαίους, καὶ τοὺς φυγαδευθέντας ἀπὸ Ἱεροσολύμων προσλαβόμενοι πολεμοτροφεῖν ἐπεχείρουν.
**16** Οἱ δὲ περὶ τὸν Μακκαβαῖον ποιησάμενοι λιτανίαν, καὶ ἀξιώσαντες τὸν Θεὸν σύμμαχον αὐτοῖς γενέσθαι, ἐπὶ
**17** τὰ τῶν Ἰδουμαίων ὀχυρώματα ὥρμησαν· οἷς καὶ προσβαλόντες εὐρώστως, ἐγκρατεῖς ἐγένοντο τῶν τόπων, πάντας τε τοὺς ἐπὶ τῷ τείχει μαχομένους ἠμύναντο· κατέσφαζον τε τοὺς ἐμπίπτοντας,
**18** ἀνεῖλον δὲ οὐχ ἧττον τῶν δισμυρίων. Συμπυγόντων δὲ οὐκ ἔλαττον τῶν ἐννακισχιλίων εἰς δύο πύργους ὀχυροὺς εὖ μάλα, καὶ
**19** πάντα τὰ πρὸς πολιορκίαν ἔχοντας, ὁ Μακκαβαῖος εἰς ἐπείγοντας τόπους ἀπολιπὼν Σίμωνα καὶ Ἰώσηπον, ἔτι δὲ καὶ Ζακχαίαν καὶ τοὺς σὺν αὐτῷ ἱκανοὺς πρὸς τὴν τούτων πολιορκίαν,
**20** αὐτὸς ἐχωρίσθη. Οἱ δὲ περὶ τὸν Σίμωνα φιλαργυρήσαντες ὑπό τινων τῶν ἐν τοῖς πύργοις ἐπείσθησαν ἀργυρίῳ· ἑπτάκις δὲ μυ-
**21** ρίας δραχμὰς λαβόντες, εἴασάν τινας διαφεύγειν. Προσαγγελθέντος δὲ τῷ Μακκαβαίῳ περὶ τοῦ γεγονότος, συναγαγὼν τοὺς ἡγουμένους τοῦ λαοῦ, κατηγόρησεν ὡς ἀργυρίου πεπράκασι τοὺς
**22** ἀδελφούς, τοὺς πολεμίους κατ᾽ αὐτῶν ἀπολύσαντες. Τούτους

**8** His own place. And they decreed, moreover, by a common ordinance and a decree unto all the nation of the Jews, to keep these selfsame days year by year.

**9** Now concerning the death of Antiochus, that was surnamed Epiphanes, thus it was. But now will we declare the things pertaining to
**10** Antiochus Eupator, who was the son of that impious [man],
**11** abridging those evils of wars which did encompass [them]. For he, having received the kingdom, did appoint in his decrees a certain Lysias, [to be] governor and chief prince of Coele-Syria and Phoenicia.

**12** For Ptolemy, who was called Macron, maintaining that which was righteous, showing favor unto the Jews because of the injustice that had been done unto them, sought to deal peaceably with them.
**13** Wherefore, being accused by his friends unto Eupator, and hearing himself called a traitor in every respect, because he had abandoned Cyprus, which was entrusted unto him by Philometor, and had gone over to Antiochus Epiphanes, and having no noble power, through despondency he did poison himself and departed this life.

**14** But Gorgias, being made governor of those places, did nourish foreign soldiers, and in every respect did foment war against the Jews.
**15** And with him also the Idumeans, being masters of opportune strongholds, did harass the Jews, and having taken unto themselves those who were exiled from Jerusalem, they sought to wage war.

**16** But they that were about Maccabeus, having made a supplication and besought God to become their ally, did go forth against
**17** the strongholds of the Idumeans; and assailing them with vigor, they became masters of those places, and repelled all them that fought upon the wall; and they did slaughter those who fell [in battle],
**18** and they slew no less than twenty thousand. And when no fewer than nine thousand had pressed together into two exceeding strong towers, and
**19** had all things for a siege, Maccabeus, departing unto pressing places, did leave Simon and Joseph, yea, and Zacchaeus, and them that were with him, [being] sufficient for the siege of these [towers],
**20** he himself withdrew. But they that were about Simon, being greedy of money, were persuaded by certain of them that were in the towers with silver; and having received seventy thousand drachmas,
**21** they suffered certain [men] to escape. But when the thing that was done was reported unto Maccabeus, he, gathering together the leaders of the people, did accuse them that they had sold their brethren for money,
**22** having set free their enemies against themselves. These, therefore,
