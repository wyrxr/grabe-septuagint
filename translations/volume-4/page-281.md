19 Ἄνθρωπος ἄχαρις, μῦθος ἄκαιρος· ἐν στόματι ἀπαιδεύτων ἐνδελεχισθήσεται.
20 Ἀπὸ στόματος μωροῦ ἀποδοκιμάζεται παραβολή· οὐ γὰρ μὴ εἴπῃ αὐτὴν ἐν καιρῷ αὐτῆς.
21 Ἔστι κωλυόμενος ἁμαρτάνειν ἀπὸ ἐνδείας· καὶ ἐν τῇ ἀναπαύσει αὐτοῦ οὐ κατανυγὴσεται.
22 Ἔστιν ἀπολλύων τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ δι᾽ αἰσχύνην, καὶ ἀπὸ ἄφρονος προσώπου ἀπολεῖ αὐτήν.
23 Ἔστι χάριν αἰσχύνης ἐπαγγελλόμενος φίλῳ, καὶ ἐκτήσατο αὐτὸν ἐχθρὸν δωρεάν.
24 Μῶμος πονηρὸς ἐν ἀνθρώπῳ ψεῦδος· ἐν στόματι ἀπαιδευτῶν ἐνδελεχισθήσεται.
25 Αἱρετὸν κλέπτης ἢ ὁ ἐνδελεχίζων ψεῦδει· ἀμφότεροι δὲ ἀπώλειαν κληρονομήσουσιν.
26 Ἦθος ἀνθρώπου ψευδοῦς ἀτιμία, καὶ ἡ αἰσχύνη αὐτοῦ μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ ἐνδελεχῶς.
27 Λόγοι παραβολῶν. Ὁ σοφὸς ἐν λόγοις προάξει ἑαυτόν, καὶ ἄνθρωπος φρόνιμος ἀρέσει μεγιστᾶσιν.
28 Ὁ ἐργαζόμενος γῆν ἀνυψώσει θημωνίαν αὑτοῦ· καὶ ὁ ἀρέσκων μεγιστᾶσιν ἐξιλάσεται ἀδικίας.
29 Ξένια καὶ δῶρα ἀποτυφλοῖ ὀφθαλμοὺς σοφῶν, καὶ ὡς φῖμος ἐν στόματι ἀποτρέπει ἐλεγμούς.
30 Σοφία κεκρυμμένη καὶ θησαυρὸς ἀφανής, τίς ὠφέλεια ἐν ἀμφοτέροις;
31 Κρείττων ἄνθρωπος ἀποκρύπτων τὴν μωρίαν αὑτοῦ, ἢ ἄνθρωπος ἀποκρύπτων τὴν σοφίαν αὑτοῦ.
32 Κρείσσων ὑπομονὴ ἀπαραίτητος ἐν ζητήσει Κυρίου, ἢ ἀδέσποτος τροχηλάτης τῆς ἰδίας ζωῆς.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΑ΄. ΧΧΙ.
1 ΤΕΚΝΟΝ ἥμαρτες, μὴ προσθῇς μηκέτι, καὶ περὶ τῶν προτέρων σου δέηθητι.
2 Ὡς ἀπὸ προσώπου ὄφεως, φεῦγε ἀπὸ ἁμαρτίας· ἐὰν γὰρ προσέλθῃς, δήξεται σε· ὀδόντες λέοντος οἱ ὀδόντες αὐτῆς, ἀναιροῦντες ψυχὰς ἀνθρώπων.
3 Ὡς ῥομφαία δίστομος πᾶσα ἀνομία, καὶ τῇ πληγῇ αὐτῆς οὐκ ἔστιν ἴασις.
4 Καταπληγμὸς καὶ ὕβρις ἐρημώσουσι πλοῦτον· οὕτως οἶκος ὑπερηφάνων ἐρημωθήσεται.
5 Δέησις πτωχοῦ ἐκ στόματος ἕως ὠτίων αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὸ κρίμα αὐτοῦ κατὰ σπουδὴν ἔρχεται.
6 Μισῶν ἔλεγχον, ἐν ἴχνει ἁμαρτωλοῦ· καὶ ὁ φοβούμενος Κύριον ἐπιστρέφει ἐπὶ καρδίαν αὐτοῦ.
7 Γνωστὸς μακρόθεν ὁ δυνατὸς ἐν γλώσσῃ· ὁ δὲ νοήμων οἶδεν ἐν τῷ ὀλισθαίνειν αὐτόν.
8 Ὁ οἰκοδομῶν τὴν οἰκίαν αὑτοῦ ἐν χρήμασιν ἀλλοτρίοις, ὡς συνάγων τοὺς λίθους αὑτοῦ εἰς χειμῶνα.
9 Στυππεῖον συνηγμένον συναγωγὴ ἀνόμων, καὶ ἡ συντέλεια αὐτῶν

**Chapter Twenty**

An ungracious man [is as] an untimely tale;
it shall be prolonged in the mouth of the unlearned.
From the mouth of a fool is a parable rejected;
for he shall certainly not speak it in its opportune time.
There is one who is hindered from sinning by reason of want;
and in his repose, he shall not be pricked to the heart.
There is one who loses his soul through shame,
and for the sake of a foolish countenance shall he lose it.
There is one who, for the sake of shame, promises to a friend,
and has gained him an enemy for naught.
An evil blemish in a man is falsehood;
in the mouth of the unlearned shall it be prolonged.
A thief is preferable to him that persists in falsehood;
yet both shall inherit destruction.
The character of a lying man is dishonor,
and his shame continues with him perpetually.

**Words of Parables.**

The wise man in his words shall promote himself,
and a prudent man shall please great men.
He that works the land shall raise up his heap [of produce];
and he that pleases great men shall atone for injustices.
Gifts and presents do blind the eyes of the wise,
and as a muzzle in the mouth, they turn away reproofs.
Hidden wisdom and an unseen treasure,
what profit is there in both of them?
Better is a man who hides his folly,
than a man who hides his wisdom.
Better is unceasing endurance in seeking the Lord,
than an uncontrolled charioteer of his own life.

**Chapter Twenty-One**

My son, if you have sinned, add no more thereto,
and pray concerning your former [sins].
As from the face of a serpent, flee from sin;
for if you draw nigh, it shall bite you.
The teeth thereof are as the teeth of a lion,
destroying the souls of men.
All lawlessness is as a two-edged sword,
and there is no healing for the wound thereof.
Dismay and insolence shall lay waste wealth;
thus shall the house of the proud be made desolate.
The prayer of the poor [ascends] from his mouth even unto His ears,
and his judgment comes swiftly.
He that hates reproof is in the footsteps of a sinner;
but he that fears the Lord turns to his own heart.
He that is mighty in tongue is known from afar;
but the man of understanding knows when he falters.
He that builds his house with other men's money
is as one gathering his stones against a winter storm.
Gathered tow is the assembly of the lawless,
and their consummation.
