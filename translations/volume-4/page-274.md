κατὰ χεῖρας αὐτῆς, καὶ καταλύσει ἐν καταλύματι ἀγαθῶν· καὶ 26
στήσει τὰ τέκνα αὐτοῦ ἐν σκέπῃ αὐτῆς, καὶ ὑπὸ τοὺς κλάδους
αὐτῆς αὐλισθήσεται· σκεπασθήσεται ὑπ᾽ αὐτῆς ἀπὸ καύματος, καὶ 27
ἐν τῇ δόξῃ αὐτῆς καταλύσει.

  Ὁ φοβούμενος Κύριον ποιήσει αὐτὸ, καὶ ὁ ἐγκρατὴς τοῦ νό- 1
μου καταλήψεται αὐτήν. Καὶ ὑπαντήσει αὐτῷ ὡς μήτηρ, καὶ ὡς 2
γυνὴ παρθενίας προσδέξεται αὐτόν· ψωμιεῖ αὐτὸν ἄρτον συνέ- 3
σεως, καὶ ὕδωρ σοφίας ποτιεῖ αὐτόν· στηριχθήσεται ἐπ᾽ αὐτὴν 4
καὶ οὐ μὴ κλιθῇ. Καὶ ἐπ᾽ αὐτῇ ἐφέξει καὶ οὐ μὴ καταισχυνθῇ·
καὶ ὑψώσει αὐτὸν παρὰ τοὺς πλησίον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐν μέσω ἐκκλη- 5
σίας ἀνοίξει τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ· εὐφροσύνην καὶ στέφανον ἀγαλλιά- 6
ματος εὑρήσει, καὶ ὄνομα αἰῶνος κατακληρονομήσει. Οὐ μὴ κα- 7
ταλήψονται αὐτὴν ἄνθρωποι ἀσύνετοι, καὶ ἄνθρωποι ἁμαρτωλοὶ
οὐ μὴ ἴδωσιν αὐτήν· μακράν ἐστιν ὑπερηφανίας, καὶ ἄνδρες ψευ- 8
σταὶ οὐ μὴ μνησθήσονται αὐτῆς. Οὐχ ὡραῖος αἶνος ἐν στόματι 9
ἁμαρτωλοῦ, ὅτι οὐ παρὰ Κυρίου ἀπεστάλη· ἐν γὰρ σοφίᾳ ῥηθή- 10
σεται αἶνος, καὶ ὁ Κύριος εὐοδώσει αὐτόν. Μὴ εἴπῃς· ὅτι διὰ Κύ- 11
ριον ἀπέστην· ἃ γὰρ ἐμίσησεν, οὐ ποιήσεις. Μὴ εἴπῃς· ὅτι αὐτὸς 12
με ἐπλάνησεν· οὐ γὰρ χρείαν ἔχει ἀνδρὸς ἁμαρτωλοῦ. Πᾶν βδέ- 13
λυγμα ἐμίσησεν ὁ Κύριος, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἀγαπητὸν τοῖς φοβου-
μένοις αὐτόν. Αὐτὸς ἐξ ἀρχῆς ἐποίησεν ἄνθρωπον, καὶ ἀφῆκεν 14
αὐτὸν ἐν χειρὶ διαβουλίου αὐτοῦ· ἐὰν θέλῃς, συντηρήσεις ἐντολὰς, 15
καὶ πίστιν ποιήσῃς εὐδοκίας. Παρέθηκε σοι πῦρ καὶ ὕδωρ, ὃ ἐὰν 16
θέλῃς ἐκτενεῖς τὴν χεῖρά σου· ἔναντι ἀνθρώπων ἡ ζωὴ καὶ ὁ θά- 17
νατος, καὶ ὃ ἐὰν εὐδοκήσῃ, δοθήσεταί σοι. Ὅτι πολλὴ ἡ σοφία 18
τοῦ Κυρίου· ἰσχυρὸς ἐν δυναστείᾳ, καὶ βλέπων τὰ πάντα· καὶ οἱ 19
ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τοὺς φοβουμένους αὐτὸν, καὶ αὐτὸς ἐπιγνώ-
σεται πᾶν ἔργον ἀνθρώπου. Οὐκ ἐνετείλατο οὐδενὶ ἀσεβεῖν, καὶ
οὐκ ἔδωκε ἄνεσιν οὐδενὶ ἁμαρτάνειν.

**Chapter Fifteen, Thirteen**

... in her hands; and he shall lodge in a dwelling of good things. And 26
He shall establish his children beneath her shelter, and under her branches
shall he take up his abode; he shall be protected by her from the heat, and 27
in her glory shall he lodge.

**Chapter Fifteen, XV.**

The man that feareth the Lord shall perform [it], and he that is steadfast in the Law
shall attain unto her. And she shall meet him as a mother, and as 2
a chaste bride shall she receive him. She shall feed him with the bread of 3
understanding, and with the waters of wisdom shall she give him to drink. He shall be upheld by her 4
and shall not be moved. And unto her shall he cleave, and shall not be put to shame.
And she shall exalt him above his neighbors, and in the midst of the 5
assembly shall he open his mouth. Joy and a crown of rejoicing 6
shall he find, and an everlasting name shall he inherit. Men void of understanding 7
shall not attain unto her, and sinful men
shall not behold her. Far is she from pride, and men of falsehood 8
shall not remember her. Not comely is praise in the mouth of 9
a sinner, for it was not sent from the Lord. For in wisdom shall 10
praise be spoken, and the Lord shall prosper it. Say not, "Because of the 11
Lord did I stray;" for what things He hath abhorred, those shalt thou not do. Say not, "That He 12
hath caused me to err;" for He hath no need of a sinful man. All 13
abomination hath the Lord hated, and it is not beloved by them that fear
Him. He from the beginning did make man, and left 14
him in the hand of his own counsel. If thou wilt, thou shalt keep the commandments, 15
and thou shalt perform faith pleasing unto Him. He hath set before thee fire and water; 16
wheresoever thou wilt, thou shalt stretch forth thy hand. Before men are life and 17
death, and whatsoever he shall choose, it shall be given unto thee. For great is the wisdom 18
of the Lord; mighty in [His] power, and seeing all things. And His 19
eyes are upon them that fear Him, and He Himself shall discern
every work of man. He hath not commanded any to be ungodly, and
He hath not given licence unto any to sin.

**Chapter Fifteen, XVI.**

Desire not a multitude of unprofitable children, neither rejoice over 1
