τῶν ἱερῶν σκευῶν προαγορεύσαντες. Δι᾽ ἣν αἰτίαν καὶ Τύριοι 49
μισοπονηρεύσαντες τὰ πρὸς τὴν χηδείαν αὐτῶν μεγαλομερῶς ἐχρῆγησαν. Ὁ δὲ Μενέλαος διὰ τὰς τῶν κρατούντων πλεονε-

ΠΕΡΙ δὲ τὸν καιρὸν τοῦτον τὴν δευτέραν ἄφοδον ὁ Ἀν- 1
τίοχος εἰς Αἴγυπτον ἔστειλατο. Συνέβη δὲ καθ᾽ ὅλην τὴν πόλιν 2
σχεδὸν ἐφ᾽ ἡμέρας τεσσαράκοντα φαίνεσθαι διὰ τῶν ἀέρων τρέ-
χοντας ἵππεις διαχρύσους στολὰς ἔχοντας, καὶ λόγχας σπειρο-
δὸν ἐξωπλισμένους, (καὶ μαχαιρῶν σπασμοὺς) καὶ εἴλας ἵππων 3
διατεταγμένας, καὶ προσβολὰς γινομένας, καὶ καταδρομὰς ἑκατέ-
ρων, καὶ ἀσπίδων κινήσεις, καὶ καμάκων πλῆθη, καὶ μαχαιρῶν
σπασμοὺς, καὶ βελῶν βολὰς, καὶ χρυσέων κέσμων ἐκλάμψεις,
καὶ παντοίους θωρακισμούς. Διὸ πάντες ἤξουν ἐπ᾽ ἀγαθῷ τὴν 4
ἐπιφάνειαν γεγονῆσθαι. Γενομένης δὲ λαλίας ψευδοῦς, ὡς μετηλ- 5
λαχότος Ἀντιόχου τὸν βίον, παραλαβὼν δ᾽ Ἰάσων οὐκ ἐλάττους
τῶν χιλίων, αἰφνιδίως ἐπὶ τὴν πόλιν συνετελέσατο ἐπίθεσιν·
τῶν δὲ ἐπὶ τῷ τείχει συνελασθέντων, καὶ τέλος ἤδη καταλαμ-
βανομένης τῆς πόλεως, ὁ Μενέλαος εἰς τὴν ἀκρόπολιν ἐφυγάδευ-
σεν. Ὁ δὲ Ἰάσων ἐποιεῖτο σφαγὰς τῶν πολιτῶν τῶν ἰδίων ἀ- 6
φειδῶς, οὐ συννοῶν τὴν εἰς τοὺς συγγενεῖς εὐημερίαν δυσμε-
ρίαν εἶναι τὴν μεγίστην· δοκῶν δὲ πολεμίων καὶ οὐχ ὁμοεθνῶν
τρόπαια καταβάλλεσθαι, τῆς μὲν ἀρχῆς οὐκ ἐκράτησε, τὸ δὲ τέ- 7
λος τῆς ἐπιβουλῆς αἰσχύνην λαβὼν, φυγὰς πάλιν εἰς τὴν Ἀμ-
μανῖτιν παρῆλθεν. Πέρας οὖν κακῆς ἀναστροφῆς ἔτυχεν ἐγκλει- 8
σθεὶς πρὸς Ἀρέταν τὸν τῶν Ἀράβων τύραννον, πόλιν ἐκ πόλεως
φεύγων, διωκόμενος ὑπὸ πάντων, καὶ στυγούμενος ὡς τῶν νό-
μων ἀποστάτης, καὶ βδελυσσόμενος ὡς πατρίδος καὶ πολιτῶν
δήμιος, εἰς Αἴγυπτον ἐξεβράσθη. Καὶ ὁ συχνοὺς τῆς πατρίδος 9
ἀποξενώσας ἐπιξένης ἀπώλετο πρὸς Λακεδαιμονίους ἀναχθείς, ὡς
διὰ τὴν συγγένειαν τευξόμενος σκέπης. Καὶ ὁ πλῆθος ἀτάφων 10
ἐκρίψας ἀπένθητος ἐγενήθη, καὶ κηδείας οὐδ᾽ ἤτινος οὔτε πα-
τρίου τάφου μετέσχε. Προσπεσόντων δὲ τῷ βασιλεῖ περὶ τῶν 11

#### CHAPTER IV.

...the holy vessels.
**49** Wherefore, also the Tyrians, detesting their wickedness, did greatly and generously provide for their burial. But Menelaus, through the avarice of those who held power, did remain in his office, being reproached for his wickedness, and established as a great plotter against the citizens.

#### CHAPTER V.

**1** Now about this time, Antiochus did send forth his second expedition into Egypt.
**2** And it came to pass that throughout the whole city, for almost forty days, there did appear through the air horsemen running, clad in golden apparel, and armed with spears in coiled array, [yea], and the drawing forth of swords;
**3** and squadrons of horsemen arrayed, and assaults made, and charges of both sides, and movements of shields, and a multitude of lances, and the drawing forth of swords, and the casting of darts, and the gleaming forth of golden helmet-crests, and every manner of armor.
**4** Wherefore, all did expect that this manifestation had come to pass for good.
**5** Now when a false rumour had arisen, that Antiochus had departed this life, Jason, taking with him no fewer than a thousand men, did suddenly accomplish an assault upon the city. And as those upon the wall were driven back, and the city was at length being taken, Menelaus did flee into the citadel.
**6** But Jason did make an unsparing slaughter of his own citizens, not perceiving that prosperity [gained] against one's own kinsmen was the greatest of misfortunes. For he, supposing that he was setting up trophies over his enemies and not over his own countrymen, did not however gain the sovereignty.
**7** But having brought shame upon the end of his conspiracy, he did again depart as a fugitive into Ammonitis.
**8** Thus, then, did he meet with the end of his wicked conduct, being shut up with Aretas, the tyrant of the Arabs; fleeing from city to city, pursued by all men, and hated as an apostate from the laws, and abhorred as the executioner of his country and fellow-citizens, he was cast out into Egypt.
**9** And he, who had alienated many from their native land, did himself perish in a strange country, having been brought unto the Lacedaemonians, as one expecting to obtain protection by reason of his kinship [with them].
**10** And he, who had cast forth a multitude of unburied [bodies], was himself unmourned; neither did he partake of any funeral rites, nor of an ancestral tomb.
**11** But when tidings concerning these things had reached the king...
