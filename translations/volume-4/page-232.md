αὐτῶν, ἃ δύνανται ἐκφυγόντα εἰς σκέπην, αὐτὰ ὠφελῆσαι. Κατ᾿ οὐδένα οὖν τρόπον ἐστὶν ἡμῖν φανερόν, ὅτι εἰσὶ θεοί· διὸ μὴ φοβηθῆτε αὐτούς. Ὥσπερ γὰρ ἐν σικυηράτῳ προβεβασκάνιον οὐδὲν φυλάσσον, οὕτως εἰ θεοὶ αὐτῶν εἰσι ξύλινοι καὶ περίχρυσοι καὶ περιάργυροι, τὸν αὐτὸν τρόπον καὶ τῇ ἐν κήπῳ ῥάμνῳ, ἐφ᾿ ἧς πᾶν ὄρνεον ἐπικάθηται, ὡσαύτως καὶ νεκρῷ ἐῤῥιμμένῳ ἐν σκότει ἀφομοιοῦνται εἰ θεοὶ αὐτῶν ξύλινοι, καὶ περίχρυσοι, καὶ περιάργυροι. Ἀπό τε τῆς πορφύρας καὶ τῆς μαρμάρου τῆς ἐπ᾿ αὐτῶν σηπομένης γνώσεσθε, ὅτι οὐκ εἰσὶ θεοί· αὐτά τε ἐξ ὑστέρου βρωθήσονται ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔσται ὄνειδος ἐν χώρᾳ. Κρεῖσσον οὖν ἄνθρωπος δίκαιος οὐκ ἔχων εἴδωλα, ἔσται γὰρ αὐτὸς μακρὰν ἀπὸ ὀνειδισμοῦ.

**CHAPTER I. EPISTLE**

...than them [the idols], for they [the beasts] are able to help themselves, having fled unto a shelter. In no wise, therefore, is it manifest unto us that they are gods; wherefore, fear ye them not.

For just as a scarecrow in a cucumber field protecteth nothing, even so are their gods, if they be made of wood, and plated with gold and with silver.

In the same manner, they are likened to a thornbush in a garden, upon which every bird doth settle; likewise, are they likened unto a dead man cast forth in darkness, if their gods be made of wood, and plated with gold, and plated with silver.

And from the purple and the marble that doth decay upon them shall ye know that they are no gods; for they themselves shall afterward be consumed by [vermin from] them, and it shall be a reproach in the land.

Better, therefore, is a righteous man who hath no idols, for he himself shall be far removed from reproach.
