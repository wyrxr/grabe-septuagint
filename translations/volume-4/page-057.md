τῇ διανοίᾳ· τοῦ τε βασιλέως καὶ τοῦ ὀρφανοῦ ποιεῖ τὴν διά-
νοιαν μίαν, τήν τε τοῦ οἰκέτου καὶ τὴν τοῦ ἐλευθέρου, τήν τε τοῦ
**πένητος** καὶ τὴν τοῦ πλουσίου· καὶ πᾶσαν διάνοιαν μεταστρέφει
εἰς εὐωχίαν καὶ εὐφροσύνην, καὶ οὐ μέμνηται πᾶσαν λύπην καὶ
πᾶν ὀφείλημα· καὶ πάσας τὰς καρδίας ποιεῖ πλουσίας, καὶ οὐ
μέμνηται βασιλέα, οὐδὲ σατράπην. καὶ πάντα διὰ ταλάντων ποι-
εῖ λαλεῖν. Καὶ οὐ μέμνηται ὅταν πίνωσι, φιλιάζειν φίλοις καὶ
ἀδελφοῖς, καὶ μετ᾽ οὐ πολὺ σπῶνται τὰς μαχαίρας. Καὶ ὅταν
ἀπὸ τοῦ οἴνου ἐγερθῶσιν, οὐ μέμνηνται ἃ ἔπραξαν. Ὦ ἄνδρες·
οὐχ ὑπερισχύει ὁ οἶνος, ὅτι οὕτως ἀναγκάζει ποιεῖν; καὶ ἐσίγη-
σεν οὕτως εἰπών.

**ΚΕΦ. Δ΄. IV.**

ΚΑΙ ἤρξατο ὁ δεύτερος λαλεῖν, ὁ εἰπὼν περὶ τῆς ἰσχύος τοῦ
βασιλέως. Ὦ ἄνδρες, οὐχ ὑπερισχύουσιν οἱ ἄνθρωποι τὴν γῆν καὶ
τὴν θάλασσαν κατακρατοῦντες καὶ πάντα τὰ ἐν αὐτοῖς; ὁ δὲ βα-
σιλεὺς ὑπερισχύει καὶ κυριεύει πάντων, καὶ δεσπόζει αὐτῶν, καὶ
πᾶν ὃ ἂν εἴπῃ αὐτοῖς, ποιήσουσιν. Ἐὰν εἴπῃ αὐτοῖς ποιῆσαι πόλε-
μον ἕτερος πρὸς τὸν ἕτερον, ποιοῦσιν· ἐὰν δὲ ἐξαποστείλῃ αὐτοὺς
πρὸς τοὺς πολεμίους, βαδίζουσι· καὶ κατεργάζονται τὰ ὄρη καὶ
τὰ τείχη καὶ τοὺς πύργους, φονεύουσι καὶ φονεύονται, καὶ τὸν λό-
γον τοῦ βασιλέως οὐ παραβαίνουσιν· ἐὰν δὲ νικήσωσι, τῷ βασι-
λεῖ κομίζουσι πάντα, καὶ ὅσα ἐὰν προνομεύσωσι, καὶ τὰ ἄλλα
πάντα. Καὶ ὅσοι οὐ στρατεύονται οὐ δὲ πολεμοῦσιν, ἀλλὰ γεωρ-
γοῦσι τὴν γῆν, πάλιν ὅταν σπείρωσι θερίσαντες ἀναφέρουσι τῷ
βασιλεῖ, καὶ ἕτερος τὸν ἕτερον ἀναγκάζοντες, ἀναφέρουσι τοὺς φό-
ρους τῷ βασιλεῖ. Καὶ αὐτὸς εἷς μόνος ἐστίν· ἐὰν εἴπῃ ἀποκτεῖναι,
ἀποκτείνουσιν· ἐὰν εἴπῃ ἀφιέναι, ἀφιοῦσιν· εἴπ**ῃ** πατάξαι, τύπτου-
σιν· εἴπ**ῃ** ἐρημῶσαι, ἐρημοῦσιν· εἴπ**ῃ** οἰκοδομῆσαι, οἰκοδομοῦσιν·
εἴπ**ῃ** ἐκκόψαι, ἐκκόπτουσιν· εἴπ**ῃ** φυτεῦσαι, φυτεύουσι. Καὶ πᾶς
ὁ λαὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ αἱ δυνάμεις αὐτοῦ ἐνωχοῦσι. πρὸς δὲ τού-
τοις, αὐτὸς ἀνάκειται, ἐσθίει, καὶ πίνει, καὶ καθεύδει· οὗτοι δὲ
τηροῦσι περὶ αὐτὸν κύκλῳ, καὶ οὐ δύναται ἕκαστος ἀπελθεῖν, καὶ
ποιεῖν τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ, οὐδὲ παρακούουσιν αὐτοῦ. Ὦ ἄνδρες, πῶς
οὐχ ὑπερισχύει ὁ βασιλεὺς, ὅτι οὕτως ἐπάκουστός ἐστι; καὶ ἐσίγησεν.

**Chapter III.** (continued)

**18** [It maketh] the mind of the king and of the orphan one,
**19** and that of the servant and that of the free, and that of the poor and that of the rich;
**20** and every mind it doth turn aside unto feasting and unto gladness,
**21** and doth not remember all sorrow and all debt.
**22** And all hearts it maketh rich, and doth not remember king, nor satrap;
**23** and all things through talents it maketh [men] to speak. And it doth not remember, when they drink, to befriend friends and brethren; and not long after they draw forth their swords.
**24** And when from the wine they be aroused, they do not remember what things they did. O men, doth not wine prevail, because it doth thus compel [men] to do?
**25** And he held his peace, having spoken thus.

**Chapter IV.**

**1** And the second began to speak, even he who spake concerning the strength of the king.
**2** O men, do not men prevail over the earth and the sea,
**3** mastering them and all things in them? But the king doth prevail and hath dominion over all, and is lord of them; and whatsoever he shall say unto them, they will do.
**4** If he shall say unto them to make war, one against the other, they do it; but if he shall send them forth against the enemies, they march; and they overthrow the mountains and the walls and the towers,
**5** they slay and are slain, and the word of the king they do not transgress. But if they prevail, they bring all things to the king, and whatsoever they shall plunder, and all other things.
**6** And as many as do not make war nor go to battle, but till the earth, again, when they sow and reap, they bring [tribute] to the king; and compelling one another, they bring the tributes to the king.
**7** And he himself is but one: if he shall say to slay, they slay;
**8** if he shall say to release, they release; if he shall say to smite, they smite; if he shall say to lay waste, they lay waste; if he shall say to build, they build;
**9** if he shall say to cut down, they cut down; if he shall say to plant, they plant.
**10** And all his people and his forces do feast.
**11** Moreover, he himself doth recline, eat, and drink, and sleep; but these do keep watch about him in a circle,
**12** and no one is able to depart and to do his own works, neither do they disobey him. O men, how doth not the king prevail, because he is thus obeyed? And he held his peace.
