**9** ...to whom [the affairs] are committed, lest they be disturbed. **25** Moreover, perceiving the rulers who are near and bordering upon the kingdom, who are watching for the opportune moments and awaiting what shall come to pass, I have declared my son Antiochus to be king; whom oftentimes, when I ascended into the upper satrapies, I commended and entrusted unto most of you. And unto him have I written the things hereunder written. **26** I do therefore exhort you and entreat you, that, remembering the benefits [ye have received] both in common and individually, each of you would maintain your goodwill towards me and my son; **27** for I am persuaded that he, following my purpose with gentleness and humanity, will likewise deal with you.

**28** Thus, therefore, the murderer and blasphemer, having suffered the most grievous things, even as he had afflicted others, did end his life by a most piteous death in a foreign land amongst the mountains. **29** And Philip, his foster-brother, was conveying his body; who, fearing the son of Antiochus, was carried away unto Ptolemy Philometor into Egypt.

**10** **1** But Maccabeus and they that were with him, the Lord going before them, recovered the Temple and the city; **2** and the altars in the marketplace, which had been wrought by the strangers, yea, and their sacred precincts, did they pull down. **3** And having cleansed the Temple, they made another altar, and, having kindled stones, and taken fire from these, they offered sacrifices after the space of two years; and [they offered] incense and lamps, and made the setting forth of the showbread. **4** And having done these things, they besought the Lord, falling prostrate upon their faces, that they should no more fall into such evils; but if ever they should sin, that they might be chastened of Him with clemency, and not be delivered unto blasphemous and barbarous nations. **5** And on the very day that the Temple was defiled by the strangers, on that same day it came to pass that the purification of the sanctuary was made, even on the five and twentieth day of the same month, which is Chislev. **6** And with joy they kept eight days, after the manner of the Feast of Tabernacles, remembering how that not long afore they had been living in the mountains and in caves like wild beasts during the Feast of Tabernacles. **7** Wherefore, having thyrsi and fair branches, yea, and palms, they gave thanks unto Him who had prospered them to cleanse His own place.
