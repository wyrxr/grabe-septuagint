**2 Maccabees Chapter 10**

**22** μὲν οὖν προδότας γενομένους ἀπέκτεινε, καὶ παραχρῆμα τοὺς δύο πύργους κατελάβετο.
**23** Τοῖς δὲ ὅπλοις τὰ πάντα ἐν τοῖς χερσὶν εὐοδοῦμενος, ἀπώλεσεν ἐν τοῖς δυσὶν ὀχυρώμασι πλείους τῶν δισμυρίων.
**24** Τιμόθεος δὲ ὁ πρῶτον ἡττηθεὶς ὑπὸ τῶν Ἰουδαίων, συναγαγὼν ξένας δυνάμεις παμπληθεῖς, καὶ τοὺς τῆς Ἀσίας γενομένους ἵππους συναθροίσας οὐκ ὀλίγους, παρῆν ὡς δοριάλωτον ληψόμενος τὴν Ἰουδαίαν.
**25** Οἱ δὲ περὶ τὸν Μακκαβαῖον, συνεγγίζοντος αὐτοῦ, πρὸς ἱκεσίαν τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐτράπησαν, γῆ τὰς κεφαλὰς καταπάσαντες, καὶ τὰς ὀσφύας σάκκοις ζώσαντες,
**26** ἐπὶ τὴν ἀπέναντι τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου κρηπῖδα προσπεσόντες, ἠξίουν ἵλεων αὐτοῖς γενόμενον ἐχθρεῦσαι τοῖς ἐχθροῖς αὐτῶν, καὶ ἀντικεῖσθαι τοῖς ἀντικειμένοις καθὼς καὶ ὁ νόμος διασαφεῖ.
**27** Γενόμενοι δὲ ἀπὸ τῆς δεήσεως, ἀναλαβόντες τὰ ὅπλα, προῆγον ἀπὸ τῆς πόλεως ἐπὶ πλεῖον· συνεγγίσαντες δὲ τοῖς πολεμίοις, ἐφ’ ἑαυτῶν ἦσαν.
**28** Ἄρτι δὲ τῆς ἀνατολῆς διαχεομένης, προσέβαλλον ἑκάτεροι· οἱ μὲν οὖν ἔγγυον ἔχοντες εὐημερίας καὶ νίκης μετὰ ἀρετῆς τὴν ἐπὶ τὸν Κύριον καταφυγήν, οἱ δὲ καθηγέμονα τῶν ἀγώνων ταττόμενοι τὸν θυμόν.
**29** Γινομένης δὲ καρτερᾶς μάχης, ἐφάνησαν τοῖς ὑπεναντίοις ἐξ οὐρανοῦ ἐφ’ ἵππων χρυσοχαλίνων πέντε ἄνδρες διαπρεπεῖς, καὶ ἀρηγούμενοι τῶν Ἰουδαίων οἱ δύο.
**30** Καὶ τὸν Μακκαβαῖον μέσον λαβόντες, καὶ σκεπάζοντες ταῖς ἑαυτῶν πανοπλίαις, ἄτρωτον διεφύλασσον· εἰς δὲ τοὺς ἐναντίους τοξεύματα καὶ κεραυνοὺς ἐξεῤῥίπτουν· διὸ συγχυθέντες ἀορασίᾳ, διεκόπτοντο ταραγῆς πεπληρωμένοι.
**31** Κατεσφάγησαν δὲ δισμύριοι πρὸς τοῖς πεντακοσίοις, ἵππεῖς δὲ ἑξακόσιοι.
**32** Αὐτὸς δὲ ὁ Τιμόθεος συνέφυγεν εἰς Γάζαρα λεγόμενον ὀχύρωμα, εὖ μάλα φρούριον, στρατηγοῦντος ἐκεῖ Χαιρέου.
**33** Οἱ δὲ περὶ τὸν Μακκαβαῖον ἀσμένως περιεκάθισαν τὸ φρούριον ἡμέρας τέσσαρας.
**34** Οἱ δὲ ἔνδον τῇ ἐρυμνότητι τοῦ τόπου πεποιθότες, ὑπεράγαν ἐβλασφήμουν, καὶ λόγους ἀθεμίτους προίοντο.
**35** Ὑποφανύσης δὲ τῆς πέμπτης ἡμέρας, εἴκοσι νεανίαι τῶν περὶ τὸν Μακκαβαῖον πυρωθέντες τοῖς θυμοῖς διὰ τὰς βλασφημίας, προσβάλλοντες τῷ τείχει, ἀῤῥενωδῶς καὶ θηριώδει θυμῷ τὸν ἐμπίπτοντα ἔκοπτον.
**36** Ἕτεροι δὲ ὁμοίως προσαναβάντες ἐν τῷ περισπασμῷ πρὸς τοὺς ἔνδον, ἐνεπίμπρων τοὺς πύργους, καὶ πυρὰς ἀνάπτοντες, ζῶντας τοὺς βλασφήμους κατέκαιον· οἱ δὲ τὰς πύλας διέκοπτον,
**37** εἰσδεξάμενοι δὲ τὴν λοιπὴν τάξιν προκατελάβοντο τὴν πόλιν, καὶ τὸν Τιμόθεον ἀποκεκρυμμένον ἐν τινι λάκκῳ κατέσφαξαν καὶ τὸν τούτου ἀδελφὸν Χαιρέαν καὶ τὸν Ἀπολλοφάνην.
**38** Ταῦτα δὲ διαπραξάμενοι, μεθ᾽ ὕμνων καὶ ἐξομολογήσεως εὐλόγουν τῷ Κυρίῳ τῷ μεγάλως εὐεργετοῦντι τὸν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ τὸ νῖκος αὐτοῖς διδότι.

**Chapter 11**

**1** ΜΕΤ᾽ ὀλίγον δὲ παντελῶς χρόνον Λυσίας ἐπίτροπος τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ συγγενὴς καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν πραγμάτων, λίαν βαρέως
**2** φέρων ἐπὶ τοῖς γεγονόσι, Συναθροίσας περὶ τὰς ὀκτὼ μυριάδας καὶ τὴν ἵππον ἅπασαν, παρεγένετο ἐπὶ τοὺς Ἰουδαίους, λογιζόμενος
**3** τὴν μὲν πόλιν Ἕλλησιν οἰκητήριον ποιήσειν, τὸ δὲ ἱερὸν ἀργυρολόγητον, καθώς τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν ἐθνῶν τεμένη, πρατήν δὲ
**4** κατὰ ἔτος τὴν ἀρχιερωσύνην ποιήσειν. Οὐδαμῶς ἐπιλογιζόμενος τὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ κράτος, πεφρονεμένος δὲ ταῖς μυρίσι τῶν πεζῶν καὶ ταῖς χιλίσι τῶν ἱππέων καὶ τοῖς ἐλέφασι τοῖς ὀγδοήκοντα.
**5** Εἰσελθὼν δὲ εἰς τὴν Ἰουδαίαν καὶ συνεγγίσας τῷ Βαιθσούρα, ὄντι μὲν ἐρυμνῷ χωρίῳ, Ἱεροσολύμων δὲ ἀπέχοντι ὡσεὶ σχοίνους
**6** πέντε, τοῦτο ἔθλιβεν. Ὡς δὲ μετέλαβον οἱ περὶ τὸν Μακκαβαῖον πολιορκοῦντα αὐτὸν τὰ ὀχυρώματα, μετὰ ὀδυρμῶν καὶ δακρύων ἱκέτευον σὺν τοῖς ὄχλοις τὸν Κύριον ἀγαθὸν ἄγγελον
**7** ἀποστεῖλαι πρὸς σωτηρίαν τῷ Ἰσραήλ. Αὐτὸς δὲ ὁ Μακκαβαῖος πρῶτος ἀναλαβὼν τὰ ὅπλα προετρέψατο τοὺς ἄλλους, ἅμα αὐτῷ διακινδυνεύοντας ἐπιβοηθεῖν τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς αὑτῶν· ὁμοῦ δὲ
**8** καὶ προθύμως ἐξώρμησαν. Αὐτόθι δὲ πρὸς τοῖς Ἱεροσολύμοις ὄντων, ἐφάνη προηγούμενος αὐτῶν ἔφιππος ἐν λευκῇ ἐσθῆτι πανοπλίαν χρυσῆν κραδαίνων.
**9** Ὁμοῦ δὲ πάντες εὐλόγησαν τὸν ἐλεήμονα Θεόν, καὶ ἐπερρώσθησαν ταῖς ψυχαῖς, οὐ μόνον ἀνθρώπους ἀλλὰ καὶ θῆρας (δὲ) τοὺς ἀγριωτάτους καὶ σιδηρᾶ τείχη τιτρώσκειν ὄντες ἕτοιμοι,
**10** προῆγον ἐν διασκευῇ τὸν ἀπ᾽ οὐρανοῦ σύμμαχον ἔχοντες ἐλεήσαντος αὐτοὺς τοῦ Κυρίου.
**11** Λεοντηδὸν δὲ ἐντινάξαντες εἰς τοὺς πολεμίους, κατέστρωσαν αὐτῶν χιλίους πρὸς τοῖς μυρίοις, ἱππεῖς δὲ ἑξακοσίους πρὸς χιλίοις· τοὺς δὲ πάντας
**12** ἠνάγκασαν φεύγειν. Οἱ πλείονες δὲ αὐτῶν τραυματίαι γυμνοὶ διεσώθησαν· καὶ αὐτὸς δὲ ὁ Λυσίας αἰσχρῶς φεύγων διεσώθη.

**Chapter 10**

**22** These, therefore, who had become traitors, did he slay, and straightway he took possession of the two towers.
**23** And he, prospering in all things with his weapons in his hands, destroyed in those two strongholds more than twenty thousand [men].

**24** But Timothy, who was first defeated by the Jews, having gathered very many foreign forces, and having assembled not a few horses that had come from Asia, came forth as one who would take Judea captive by spear.
**25** But they that were about Maccabeus, when he drew near, turned unto supplication of God, casting earth upon their heads, and girding their loins with sackcloth,
**26** falling down upon the base before the altar, they besought that He, becoming merciful unto them, would be an enemy unto their enemies, and would set Himself against their adversaries, even as the Law doth make plain.
**27** And having ceased from their supplication, they took up their weapons, and went forth further from the city; and drawing near unto their enemies, they were [resolved] of themselves.
**28** And as the dawn was now spreading forth, both sides did join battle; the one, therefore, having for a pledge of prosperity and victory with valor their recourse unto the Lord, but the others having set anger as the leader of their contests.
**29** And when a fierce battle was being fought, there appeared unto the adversaries from heaven five men of eminent appearance upon horses with golden bridles, and two of them aiding the Jews.
**30** And taking Maccabeus in their midst, and shielding him with their own full armor, they kept him unhurt; but into the adversaries they did cast arrows and thunderbolts; wherefore, being confounded by blindness, they were cut down, filled with confusion.
**31** And there were slaughtered twenty thousand and five hundred, and six hundred horsemen.
**32** But Timothy himself fled into a stronghold called Gazara, a very strong fortress, where Chaereas was governor.
**33** But they that were about Maccabeus gladly encamped against the fortress for four days.
**34** And they that were within, trusting in the strength of the place, did blaspheme exceedingly, and did utter lawless words.
**35** But when the fifth day began to dawn, twenty young men of those that were about Maccabeus, inflamed in their spirits because of the blasphemies, assailing the wall, did cut down with manly courage and with beastly rage him that encountered [them].
**36** And others likewise, having gone up in a diversion against them that were within, did set fire to the towers, and kindling fires, did burn up alive the blasphemers; and others did break down the gates,
**37** and receiving in the rest of the ranks, they did occupy the city before [them], and they slaughtered Timothy, who was hidden in a certain pit, and his brother Chaereas, and Apollophanes.
**38** And having accomplished these things, with hymns and confession they did bless the Lord, who greatly did benefit Israel, and did give unto them the victory.

**Chapter 11**

**1** Now after a very short time, Lysias, the king's regent and kinsman, and [one] over affairs, taking very grievously
**2** the things that had come to pass, having gathered about eighty thousand [men] and all the cavalry, came against the Jews,
**3** calculating that he would make the city a dwelling for Greeks, and the temple a source of tribute, as [are] the sanctuaries of the other nations, and that he would make
**4** the high priesthood for sale yearly. In no wise reckoning the power of God, but trusting in the ten thousands of infantry and the thousands of horsemen and the eighty elephants.
**5** And having entered into Judea and drawn near unto Beth-zur, which was a strong place, and distant from Jerusalem about five schoeni,
**6** he did distress this [place]. And when they that were about Maccabeus perceived that he was besieging the strongholds, with lamentations and tears they supplicated with the multitudes the Lord to send a good angel
**7** for salvation unto Israel. And Maccabeus himself, first taking up arms, exhorted the others, who were risking their lives with him, to come to the aid of their brethren; and with one accord,
**8** and eagerly they went forth. And while they were there near Jerusalem, there appeared before them a horseman in white apparel, shaking golden armor.
**9** And all together blessed the merciful God, and were strengthened in their souls, being ready to wound not only men, but also [indeed] the fiercest beasts and walls of iron,
**10** they went forth in array, having the ally from heaven, for the Lord had had mercy upon them.
**11** And having charged into the enemies like lions, they laid low of them eleven thousand, and one thousand six hundred horsemen; and they compelled them all
**12** to flee. And most of them, wounded and naked, escaped; and Lysias himself also escaped, fleeing shamefully.
