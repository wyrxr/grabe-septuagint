ἐκδιαιτηθῆναι. τότε δὴ ἀπάρας ἀπὸ τῶν Ἱεροσολύμων ἐστρατο-
6  πέδεσεν ἐπὶ Πέρσας. Ἔλεγεν δὲ ἡ μήτηρ τῶν ἑπτὰ παίδων
7  καὶ ταῦτα τὰ δίκαια τοῖς τέκνοις. ῞Οτι ἐγὼ ἐγενήθην παρθένος

8  ᾠκοδομουμένην πλευράν. Οὐ διέφθειρέν με λυμεὼν τῆς ἐρημίας
φθορεὺς ἐν πεδίῳ. οὐδὲ ἐλυμή-ατό μου τὰ ἁγνὰ τῆς παρθενίας λυ-
9  μεὼν ἀπατηλὸς ὄφις. ἔμεινα δὲ χρόνον ἀκμῆς σὺν ἀνδρί. Τού-
των δὲ ἐνηλίκων γενομένων ἐτελεύτησεν ὁ πατήρ. μακάριος μὲν
ἐκεῖνος. τὸν γὰρ τῆς εὐτεκνίας βίον ἐπιζήσας, τὸν τῆς ἀτεκνίας
10 οὐκ ὠδυνήθη καιρόν. ῞Ος ἐδίδασκεν ὑμᾶς, ἔτι ὢν σὺν ὑμῖν, τὸν
11 νόμον καὶ τοὺς προφήτας. Τὸν ἀναιρεθέντα Ἄβελ ὑπὸ Κάϊν ἀνε-
γνώσκεν δὲ ἡμῖν, καὶ τὸν ὁλοκαρπούμενον Ἰσαάκ, καὶ τὸν ἐν φυ-

13 δὲ ὑμᾶς τοὺς ἐν πυρὶ Ἀνανίαν, καὶ Ἀζαρίαν, καὶ Μισαήλ. Ἐδό-
ξαζεν δὲ καὶ τὸν ἐν λάκκῳ λεόντων Δανιήλ, ὃν καὶ ἐμακάριζεν.
14 Ὑπεμίμνησκεν δὲ ὑμᾶς τὴν Ἠσαΐου γραφὴν τὴν λέγουσαν, Κἂν
15 διὰ πυρὸς διέλθῃ, φλὸξ οὐ κατακαύσει σε. Τὸν ὑμνογράφον ἐμε-
λώδει ὑμῖν Δαυὶδ τὸν λέγοντα, πολλαὶ αἱ θλίψεις τῶν δικαίων,
16 καὶ ἐκ πασῶν αὐτῶν ρύσεται αὐτοὺς ὁ Κύριος. Τὸν Σαλο-
μῶντα ἐπαροιμιάζεν ἡμῖν τὸν λέγοντα, ξύλον ζωῆς ἐστιν πᾶσιν
17 τοῖς ποιοῦσιν αὐτοῦ τὸ θέλημα. Τὸν Ἰεζεκιὴλ ἐπιστοποιεῖτο τὸν λέ-
18 γοντα, εἰ ζήσεται τὰ ὀστᾶ τὰ ξηρὰ ταῦτα; ῏Ωιζην μὲν γὰρ ἦν
ἐδίδαξεν Μωϋσῆς οὐκ ἐπελάθετο τὴν διδάσκουσαν καὶ λέγουσαν,
19 ἐγὼ ἀποκτενῶ, καὶ ζῆν ποιήσω. Αὕτη ἡ ζωὴ ὑμῶν καὶ ἡ μα-
20 κρότης τῶν ἡμερῶν. Ὦ πικρᾶς τῆς τότε ἡμέρας, καὶ οὐ πι-
κρᾶς, ὅτε ὁ πικρὸς Ἑλλήνων τύραννος πῦρ φλέξας λέβησιν ὠμοῖς,
καὶ ζέουσι θυμοῖς ἀγαγὼν ἐπὶ τὸν καταπέλτην καὶ πάσας τὰς
21 βασάνους αὐτοῦ τοὺς ἑπτὰ παῖδας τῆς Ἀβρααμίτιδος. Καὶ τὰς
τῶν ὀμμάτων κόρας ἐπήρωσεν, καὶ γλώσσας ἐξέτεμεν, καὶ βασά-
22 νοις ποικίλαις ἀπέκτεινεν. Ὑπὲρ ὧν ἡ θεία δίκη μετῆλθεν καὶ
23 μετελεύσεται τὸν ἀλάστορα. Οἱ δὲ Ἀβραμιαῖοι παῖδες σὺν τῇ
ἀθλοφόρῳ μητρί, εἰς πατέρων χορὸν συναγελάζονται, ψυχὰς ἁγνὰς
24 καὶ ἀθανάτους ἀπειληγότες παρὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ. Ὡι ἡ δόξα εἰς τοὺς
αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων. Ἀμήν.

**CHAPTER XVIII.**
to be estranged from the ancestral customs.
**6** Then, indeed, having set forth from Jerusalem, he encamped against the Persians.
**7** And the mother of the seven children did also speak these righteous words unto her children, [saying]: "That I was born a pure virgin, and did not transgress the house of my father; but I guarded the side that was built [by God].
**8** No destroyer of the wilderness, [no] corrupter in the plain, did corrupt me; nor did the deceitful serpent, [that] destroyer, bring outrage upon my pure [estate] of virginity;
**9** but I remained for a time of my prime with a husband. And these [children] having become adult, the father did die. Blessed, indeed, was he;
**10** for having lived through the life of [having] good children, he was not pained by the time of childlessness. He who, while he was yet with you, did teach you the Law and the Prophets.
**11** And he did read unto us [concerning] Abel, who was slain by Cain; and Isaac, who was offered as a whole burnt offering; and Joseph in prison.
**12** And he did speak unto us of Phinehas the zealous;
**13** and he did teach you of Ananias, and Azarias, and Misael in the fire.
**14** And he did also glorify Daniel in the den of lions, whom he did also declare blessed. And he did remind you of the Scripture of Isaiah, which saith,
**15** 'Though thou pass through fire, the flame shall not burn thee.'
**16** He did sing unto you of David the Psalmist, who saith, 'Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord shall deliver them out of all of them.'
**17** He did quote unto us Solomon, who saith, 'A tree of life it is unto all who do His will.'
**18** He did confirm [his words] with Ezekiel, who saith, 'Shall these dry bones live?' For of [the very essence of] living, indeed, did Moses teach; he did not forget that which doth teach and say,
**19** 'I shall kill, and I shall make alive.'
**20** This [is] your life and the length of your days." O, bitter was that day then, and yet not bitter, when the bitter tyrant of the Greeks, having kindled fire in cruel cauldrons,
**21** and with boiling rage, did bring unto the rack and unto all his torments the seven children of the Abrahamite woman. And he did blind the pupils of their eyes, and he did cut out their tongues,
**22** and he did kill them with diverse torments. For whom the divine justice did avenge, and shall yet avenge, the wicked one.
**23** But the Abrahamite children, with their prize-bearing mother, are gathered together into the chorus of fathers,
**24** [having received] pure and immortal souls from God. To Whom be the glory unto the ages of ages. Amen.
