**ΚΕΦ. ΛΑ΄. ΛΑ΄.**
23 ἔργοις σου γίνου ὑπεράγων· μὴ δῶς μῶμον ἐν τῇ δόξῃ σου.
24 Ἐν ἡμέρᾳ συντελείας ἡμερῶν ζωῆς σου καὶ ἐν καιρῷ τελευτῆς
25 διάδος κληρονομίαν.

**Περὶ δούλων.**

24 Χόρτασμα καὶ ῥάβδος καὶ φορτία ἔνῳ· ἄρτος καὶ παιδεία καὶ
25 ἔργον οἰκέτῃ. Ἔργασαι ἐν παιδί, καὶ εὑρήσεις ἀνάπαυσιν· ἄνες
26 χεῖρας αὐτῷ, καὶ ζητήσει ἐλευθερίαν. Ζυγὸς καὶ ἱμὰς τράχηλον
27 κάμψουσι, καὶ οἰκέτῃ κακούργῳ στρέβλαι καὶ βάσανοι· ἔμβαλε
28 αὐτὸν εἰς ἐργασίαν ἵνα μὴ ἀργῇ, πολλὴν γὰρ κακίαν ἐδίδαξεν ἡ
29 ἀργία· εἰς ἔργα κατάστησον, καθὼς πρέπει αὐτῷ, κἂν μὴ πει-
30 θαρχῇ, βάρυνου τὰς πέδας αὐτοῦ. Καὶ μὴ περισσεύσῃς ἐπὶ πάσῃ
31 σαρκί, καὶ ἄνευ κρίσεως μὴ ποιήσῃς μηδέν. Εἰ ἔστι σοι οἰκέτης,
ἔστω σοι ὡς ἡ ψυχή σου, ὅτι ἐν αἵματι ἐκτήσω αὐτόν· εἰ ἔστι σοι
οἰκέτης, ἄγε αὐτὸν ὡς ἀδελφόν, ὅτι ὡς τῆς ψυχῆς σου ἐπιδήσεις
αὐτοῦ· ἐὰν κακώσῃς αὐτόν, καὶ ἀπάρας ἀποδρᾷ, ἐν ποίᾳ ὁδῷ ζη-
τήσεις αὐτόν;

**Περὶ ἐνυπνίων.**

1 ΚΕΝΑΙ ἐλπίδες καὶ ψευδεῖς ἀσυνέτῳ ἀνδρί, καὶ ἐνύπνια ἀναπτεροῦσιν
2 ἄφρονας. Ὡς δρασσόμενος σκιᾶς καὶ διώκων ἄνεμον, οὕτως ὁ ἐπέχων
3 ἐνυπνίοις· τοῦτο κατὰ τούτου ὅρασις ἐνυπνίων, κατέναντι προσώπου
4 ὁμοίωμα προσώπου. (Καὶ) ἀπὸ ἀκαθάρτου τί καθαρισθήσεται; καὶ ἀπὸ
5 ψευδοῦς τί ἀληθεύσει; Μαντεῖαι καὶ οἰωνισμοὶ καὶ ἐνύπνια μάταιά
6 ἐστι, καὶ ὡς ὠδινούσης φαντάζεται καρδία· ἐὰν μὴ ἀπὸ ὑψίστου
7 ἀποσταλῇ ἐν ἐπισκοπῇ σου, μὴ δῶς εἰς αὐτὰ τὴν καρδίαν σου· πολλοὺς
8 γὰρ ἐπλάνησε τὰ ἐνύπνια, καὶ ἐξέπεσον ἐλπίζοντες ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῖς.
9 Ἄνευ ψεύδους συντελεσθήσεται νόμος, καὶ σοφία στόματι πιστῷ
10 τελείωσις. Ἀνὴρ πεπλανημένος ἔγνω πολλά, καὶ ὁ πολύπειρος
11 ἐκδιηγήσεται σύνεσιν· ὃς οὐκ ἐπειράθη, ἐλίγα οἶδεν· ὁ δὲ πεπλανημένος
12 πληθύνει πανουργίαν. Πολλὰ ἑώρακα ἐν τῇ ἀποπλανήσει μου, καὶ
13 πλείονα τῶν λόγων μου σύνεσίς μου· πλεονάκις ἕως θανάτου ἐκινδύνευσα,
14 καὶ διεσώθην τούτων χάριν. Πνεῦμα φοβουμένων Κύριον ζήσεται, ἡ γὰρ

23 in all thy works be thou excelling;
    give no blemish to thy glory.
24 In the day of the completion of the days of thy life,
25 and in the time of [thy] death, distribute thine inheritance.

**Concerning Servants**

24 Fodder, and a rod, and burdens are for the Eno;
    but bread, and discipline, and work for a servant.
25 Labor with thy servant, and thou shalt find rest;
    give him free rein, and he will seek liberty.
26 A yoke and a thong shall bend the neck,
27 and for a wicked servant are racks and torments.
    Put him to work, lest he be idle,
28 for much evil hath idleness taught.
29 Set him to such tasks as befit him,
    and if he obey not, make heavy his fetters.
30 And be not overbearing to all flesh,
31 neither without judgment do thou anything.
    If thou hast a servant, let him be unto thee as thine own soul,
    for with thy life's blood didst thou acquire him.
    If thou hast a servant, treat him as a brother,
    for as thine own soul shalt thou bind him.
    If thou shouldst mistreat him, and he depart and flee away,
    by what path shalt thou seek him?

**Chapter Thirty-One**

**Concerning Dreams**

1 Vain are the hopes and false for a man without understanding,
    and dreams do puff up the foolish.
2 As one that grasps at a shadow, and chases the wind,
3 so is he that gives heed to dreams.
    This to that is a vision of dreams,
    as in the face of a man, so is the likeness of a face.
4 And from that which is unclean, what shall be cleansed?
    and from that which is false, what shall become true?
5 Divinations and omens and dreams are vain,
    and as a woman in travail doth the heart imagine.
6 Unless they be sent from the Most High in thy visitation,
    give not thy heart to them;
7 for many have dreams led astray,
    and they have fallen who trusted in them.
8 Without falsehood shall the Law be fulfilled,
    and wisdom is the perfection of a faithful mouth.
9 A man that hath wandered astray hath known many things,
    and he that is much experienced shall recount understanding.
10 He that hath not been tried knoweth little;
    but he that hath wandered multiplies craftiness.
11 Many things have I seen in my wandering,
    and greater than my words is my understanding;
12 oftentimes even unto death have I been in peril,
    and for these things' sake was I preserved.
13 The spirit of them that fear the Lord shall live, for their
