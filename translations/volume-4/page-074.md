λήμ. Καὶ νῦν τί ἐροῦμεν, Κύριε, ἔχοντες ταῦτα; παρεθέμεν γὰρ 79
τὰ προστάγματά σου, ἃ ἔδωκας ἐν χειρὶ τῶν παίδων σου τῶν προ-
φητῶν λέγων, ὅτι ἡ γῆ εἰς ἣν εἰσέρχεσθε κληρονομῆσαι, ἔστι γῆ 80
μεμολυσμένη μολυσμῷ τῶν ἀλλογενῶν τῆς γῆς, καὶ τῆς ἀκαθαρ-
σίας αὐτῶν ἐνέπλησαν αὐτήν. Καὶ νῦν τὰς θυγατέρας αὐτῶν μὴ 81
συνοικήσητε τοῖς τέκνοις ὑμῶν, καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας ὑμῶν μὴ δῶτε
τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτῶν· καὶ οὐ ζητήσετε εἰρηνεύσαι τὰ πρὸς αὐτοὺς 82
τὸν ἅπαντα χρόνον, ἵνα ἰσχύσαντες φάγητε τὰ ἀγαθὰ τῆς γῆς,
καὶ κατακληρονομήσητε τοῖς τέκνοις ὑμῶν ἕως τοῦ αἰῶνος. Καὶ 83
τὰ συμβαίνοντα πάντα ἡμῖν γίγνεται διὰ τὰ ἔργα ἡμῶν τὰ πονη-
ρὰ, καὶ τὰς μεγάλας ἁμαρτίας ἡμῶν. σὺ γὰρ, Κύριε, ἐκούφισας
τὰς ἁμαρτίας ἡμῶν, καὶ ἔδωκας ἡμῖν τοιαύτην ῥίζαν, πάλιν ἀ- 84
νεκάμψαμεν παραβῆναι τὸν νόμον σου εἰς τὸ ἐπιμιγῆναι τῇ ἀκα-
θαρσίᾳ τῶν ἐθνῶν τῆς γῆς. Οὐχὶ ὀργίσθης ἡμῖν ἀπολέσαι ἡμᾶς, 85
ἕως τοῦ μὴ καταλιπεῖν ῥίζαν καὶ σπέρμα καὶ ὄνομα ἡμῶν; Κύ- 86
ριε τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, ἀληθινὸς εἶ· κατελείφθημεν γὰρ ῥίζα ἐν τῇ σή-
μερον. Ἰδοὺ νῦν ἐσμὲν ἐνώπιόν σου ἐν ταῖς ἀνομίαις ἡμῶν. οὐ 87
γὰρ ἔστι στῆναι ἔτι ἔμπροσθέν σου ἐπὶ τούτοις. Καὶ ὅτε προσευ- 88
χόμενος Ἔζρας ἀνθωμολογεῖτο κλαίων χαμαιπετὴς ἔμπροσθεν
τοῦ ἱεροῦ, ἐπισυνήχθησαν πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐξ Ἱερουσαλὴμ ὄχλος πολὺς
σφόδρα, ἄνδρες καὶ γυναῖκες, καὶ νεανίαι, κλαυθμὸς γὰρ ἦν μέγας
ἐν τῷ πλήθει. Καὶ φωνήσας Ἰεχονίας Ἰεήλου ὁ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, 89
εἶπεν· Ἔζρα, ἡμεῖς ἡμάρτομεν εἰς τὸν Κύριον Θεὸν, καὶ συνωκί-
σαμεν γυναῖκας ἀλλογενεῖς ἀπὸ τῶν ἐθνῶν τῆς γῆς. καὶ νῦν ἐστιν
ἐπάνω πᾶς Ἰσραήλ. Ἐν τούτῳ γινέσθω ἡμῖν ὁρκωμοσία πρὸς τὸν 90
Κύριον, ἐκβαλεῖν πάσας τὰς γυναῖκας ἡμῶν τὰς ἐκ τῶν ἀλλογε-
νῶν σὺν τοῖς τέκνοις αὐτῶν, ὡς ἐκρίθη σοι. καὶ ἔσται πειθαρχοῦσι τῷ
νόμῳ Κυρίου. Ἀναστὰς ἐπιτέλει. πρὸς σὲ γὰρ τὸ πρᾶγμα, καὶ 91
ἡμεῖς μετὰ σοῦ ἰσχὺν ποιεῖν. Καὶ ἀναστὰς Ἔζρας ὥρκισε τοὺς 92
φυλάρχους τῶν ἱερέων καὶ Λευιτῶν παντὸς τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, ποιῆσαι
κατὰ ταῦτα. καὶ ὤμοσαν.

**Chapter 8**
**The Priest**
[lem].
**79** And now what shall we say, O Lord, having these things? For we have put aside Thy commandments, which Thou gavest by the hand of Thy servants the prophets, saying,
**80** "The land into which ye enter to inherit it is a land defiled with the pollution of the foreign nations of the land, and with their uncleanness have they filled it.
**81** And now, ye shall not join your children in marriage with their daughters, neither shall ye give your daughters unto their sons;
**82** and ye shall not seek to be at peace with them for all time, that ye may be strong and eat the good things of the land, and inherit it for your children forever."
**83** And all the things that have befallen us come to pass because of our wicked works, and our great sins. For Thou, O Lord, didst lighten our sins,
**84** and gavest us such a root; [yet] again have we turned back to transgress Thy law by mingling with the uncleanness of the nations of the land.
**85** Wilt Thou not be wroth with us to destroy us, until there be left no root nor seed nor name of us?
**86** O Lord of Israel, Thou art true; for we are left [but] a root this day.
**87** Behold, now we are before Thee in our iniquities; for there is no [strength] to stand any longer before Thee concerning these things.
**88** And when Ezra was praying and confessing, weeping and cast down upon the ground before the temple, there were gathered unto him from Jerusalem a very great multitude, both men and women and young men, for there was great lamentation among the multitude.
**89** And Jeconiah, the son of Jehiel, of the sons of Israel, cried out and said, "Ezra, we have sinned against the Lord God, and have married foreign wives from the nations of the land. And now, this [guilt] is upon all Israel.
**90** Let an oath unto the Lord be made unto us concerning this, that we should cast out all our foreign wives with their children, as it hath been judged by thee; and it shall be for those obeying the Law of the Lord.
**91** Arise, and accomplish [this task], for the matter pertaineth unto thee, and we are with thee to do [our] utmost."
**92** And Ezra arose and made the chiefs of the priests and Levites and of all Israel swear to do according to these things; and they swore.

**Chapter 9**
**1** And Ezra arose from the court of the temple, and went into the chamber of Jonan the son of Eliashib; and having lodged there, he tasted no bread, neither drank he water,
**2** mourning over the great iniquities of the multitude.
