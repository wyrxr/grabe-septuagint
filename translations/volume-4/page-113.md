54 ἡμῶν, καὶ ἐκαθίσαμεν ἐπὶ θρόνου βασιλείας αὐτοῦ. Καὶ νῦν σήσωμεν πρὸς ἑαυτοὺς φιλίαν, καὶ νῦν δός μοι τὴν θυγατέρα σου εἰς γυναῖκα, καὶ ἐπιγαμβρεύσω σοι, καὶ δώσω σοι δόματα, καὶ αὐτὴ ἀξία σου.
55 Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Πτολεμαῖος ὁ βασιλεύς, λέγων· ἀγαθὴ ἡμέρα, ἐν ᾗ ἀνέστρεψας εἰς γῆν πατέρων σου, καὶ ἐκάθισας ἐπὶ θρόνου βασιλείας αὐτῶν.
56 Καὶ νῦν ποιήσω σοι, ἃ ἔγραψας, ἀλλὰ ἀπάντησον εἰς Πτολεμαΐδα, ὅπως ἴδωμεν ἀλλήλους,
57 καὶ ἐπιγαμβρεύσω σοι καθὼς εἴρηκας. Καὶ ἐξῆλθε Πτολεμαῖος ἐξ Αἰγύπτου αὐτὸς καὶ Κλεοπάτρα ἡ θυγάτηρ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἦλθεν εἰς Πτολεμαΐδα ἔτους δευτέρου καὶ ἑξηκοστοῦ καὶ ἑκατοστοῦ.
58 Καὶ ἀπήντησεν αὐτῷ Ἀλέξανδρος ὁ βασιλεύς, καὶ ἐξέδοτο αὐτῷ Κλεοπάτραν τὴν θυγατέρα αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐποίησε τὸν γάμον
59 αὐτῆς ἐν Πτολεμαΐδι, καθὼς οἱ βασιλεῖς ἐν δόξῃ μεγάλῃ. Καὶ ἔγραψεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἀλέξανδρος τῷ Ἰωνάθαν ἐλθεῖν εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτῷ.
60 Καὶ ἐπορεύθη μετὰ δόξης εἰς Πτολεμαΐδα, καὶ ἀπήντησε τοῖς δυσὶ βασιλεῦσι· καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς ἀργύριον καὶ χρυσίον καὶ τοῖς φίλοις αὐτῶν καὶ δόματα πολλά, καὶ εὗρε χάριν ἐναντίον αὐτῶν.
61 Καὶ συνήχθησαν ἐπ’ αὐτὸν ἄνδρες λοιμοὶ ἐξ Ἰσραήλ, ἄνδρες παράνομοι ἐντυχεῖν κατ’ αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐ προσέσχεν αὐτοῖς ὁ βασιλεύς.
62 Καὶ προσέταξεν αὐτοῖς ὁ βασιλεύς, καὶ ἐξέδυσαν Ἰωνάθαν τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐνέδυσαν αὐτὸν πορφύραν, καὶ ἐποίησαν οὕτως.
63 Καὶ ἐκάθισεν αὐτὸν ὁ βασιλεὺς μετ’ αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπε τοῖς ἄρχουσιν αὐτοῦ· ἐξέλθατε μετ’ αὐτοῦ εἰς μέσον τῆς πόλεως, καὶ κηρύξατε τοῦ μηδένα ἐντυγχάνειν κατ’ αὐτοῦ περὶ μηδενὸς πράγματος, καὶ μηδεὶς αὐτῷ ἐνοχλείτω περὶ παντὸς λόγου.
64 Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς εἶδον οἱ ἐντυγχάνοντες τὴν δόξαν αὐτοῦ καθὼς ἐκήρυξαν, καὶ περιβεβλημένον αὐτὸν πορφύραν, καὶ ἔφυγον πάντες.
65 Καὶ ἐδόξασεν αὐτὸν ὁ βασιλεύς, καὶ ἔγραψεν αὐτὸν τῶν πρώτων φίλων, καὶ ἔθετο αὐτὸν στρατηγὸν καὶ μεριδάρχην.
66 Καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν Ἰωνάθαν εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ μετ’ εἰρήνης καὶ εὐφροσύνης.
67 Καὶ ἐν ἔτει πέμπτῳ καὶ ἑξηκοστῷ καὶ ἑκατοστῷ ἦλθε Δημήτριος ὁ υἱὸς Δημητρίου ἐκ Κρήτης εἰς τὴν γῆν τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ.
68 Καὶ ἤκουσεν Ἀλέξανδρος ὁ βασιλεύς,
69 καὶ ἐλυπήθη σφόδρα, καὶ ἀπέστρεψεν εἰς Ἀντιόχειαν. Καὶ κατέστησε Δημήτριος Ἀπολλώνιον τὸν ὄντα ἐπὶ Κοίλης Συρίας, καὶ συνήγαγε δύναμιν μεγάλην, καὶ παρενέβαλεν ἐν Ἰαμνείᾳ καὶ

**10:54** of us; and we have sat upon the throne of his kingdom. And now let us save unto ourselves a friendship, and now give me thy daughter to wife, and I shall be thy son-in-law, and I will give thee gifts, and she is worthy of thee.
**10:55** Then answered King Ptolemy, saying: A good day is this, wherein thou art returned unto the land of thy fathers, and sittest upon the throne of their kingdom.
**10:56** And now I will do for thee that which thou hast written; but meet me in Ptolemais, that we may see one another,
**10:57** and I will make affinity with thee, as thou hast spoken. So Ptolemy went forth from Egypt, he himself and Cleopatra his daughter, and came unto Ptolemais in the hundred sixty-second year.
**10:58** And King Alexander met him, and gave him Cleopatra his daughter, and solemnized her marriage
**10:59** in Ptolemais, according to the manner of kings, with great glory. And King Alexander wrote unto Jonathan, that he should come to meet him.
**10:60** And he went with glory unto Ptolemais, and met the two kings; and gave them silver and gold, and also many gifts to their friends, and found favour in their sight.
**10:61** And there gathered against him certain pestilent men out of Israel, men of lawlessness, to make petition against him; but the king hearkened not unto them.
**10:62** And the king commanded [his servants], and they stripped Jonathan of his garments, and clothed him in purple; and so did they.
**10:63** And the king caused him to sit with him, and said unto his princes: Go forth with him into the midst of the city, and make proclamation that none should make petition against him concerning any matter, and that no man trouble him for any cause.
**10:64** And it came to pass, when those who made petition saw his glory, according as they had proclaimed, and that he was arrayed in purple, then fled they all.
**10:65** And the king magnified him, and enrolled him among his chief friends, and made him a general and a governor of a district.
**10:66** So Jonathan returned to Jerusalem with peace and with joy.
**10:67** And in the hundred sixty-fifth year came Demetrius the son of Demetrius out of Crete into the land of his fathers.
**10:68** And when King Alexander heard thereof,
**10:69** he was sorely grieved, and turned back unto Antioch. And Demetrius appointed Apollonius, who was governor over Coele-Syria, and gathered a great host, and encamped in Jamnia, and
