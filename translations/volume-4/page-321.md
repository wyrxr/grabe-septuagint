Προσευχὴ Ἰησοῦ υἱοῦ Σιράχ.

ΕΞΟΜΟΛΟΓΗΣΟΜΑΙ σοι Κύριε βασιλεῦ, καὶ αἰνέσω σε 1
Θεὸν τὸν σωτήρά μου, ἐξομολογοῦμαι τῷ ὀνόματί σου· ὅτι σκε- 2
παστὴς καὶ βοηθὸς ἐγένου μοι, καὶ ἐλυτρώσω τὸ σῶμά μου ἐξ
ἀπωλείας, καὶ ἐκ παγίδος διαβολῆς γλώσσης, ἀπὸ χειλέων ἐρ-
γαζομένων ψεῦδος, καὶ ἔναντι τῶν παρεστηκότων ἐγένου μοι
βοηθός, καὶ ἐλυτρώσω με κατὰ τὸ πλῆθος ἐλέους καὶ ὀνόματός 3
σου, ἐκ βρυγμῶν ἑτοίμων εἰς βρῶμα, ἐκ χειρὸς ζητούντων τὴν
ψυχήν μου, ἐκ πλειόνων θλίψεων ὧν ἔσχον, ἀπὸ πνιγμοῦ πυρᾶς 4
κυκλόθεν, καὶ ἐκ μέσου πυρὸς οὗ οὐκ ἐξέκαυσα, ἐκ βάθους κοι- 5
λίας ἅδου, καὶ ἀπὸ γλώσσης ἀκαθάρτου καὶ λόγου ψευδοῦς. Βα- 6
σιλεῖ διαβολὴ ἐκ γλώσσης ἀδίκου· ἤγγισεν ἕως θανάτου ἡ ψυχή
μου, καὶ ἡ ζωή μου ἦν σύνεγγυς ἅδου κάτω. Περιέσχον με πάν- 7
τοθεν, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ βοηθῶν· ἔβλεπον εἰς ἀντίληψιν ἀνθρώπων,
καὶ οὐκ ἦν. Καὶ ἐμνήσθην τοῦ ἐλέους σου Κύριε, καὶ τῆς ἐργα- 8
σίας σου τῆς ἀπ᾽ αἰῶνος· ὅτι ἐξαιρῇ τοὺς ὑπομένοντάς σε, καὶ
9 σῴζεις αὐτοὺς ἐκ χειρὸς ἐχθρῶν· καὶ ἀνύψωσα ἀπὸ γῆς ἱκετείαν
10 μου, καὶ ὑπὲρ θανάτου ῥήσεως ἐδεήθην· ἐπεκαλεσάμην Κύριον πατέρα κυρίου μου, μὴ με ἐγκαταλιπεῖν ἐν ἡμέραις θλίψεως, ἐν καιρῷ ὑπερηφάνων ἀβοηθησίας·
11 αἰνέσω τὸ ὄνομά σου ἐνδελεχῶς,
12 καὶ ὑμνήσω ἐν ἐξομολογήσει· καὶ εἰσηκούσθη ἡ δέησίς μου. Ἤσωσας γάρ με ἐξ ἀπωλείας, καὶ ἐξείλου με ἐκ χειρὸς πονηροῦ (καὶ ἐξείλου με)· διὰ τοῦτο ἐξομολογήσομαί σοι, καὶ αἰνέσω σοι, καὶ
13 εὐλογήσω τῷ ὀνόματι Κυρίου. Ἔτι ὢν νεώτερος πρὶν πλανηθῆναί με,
14 ἐζήτησα σοφίαν προφανῶς ἐν προσευχῇ μου· ἔναντι ναοῦ
15 ἠξίουν περὶ αὐτῆς, καὶ ἕως ἐσχάτων ἐζήτησα αὐτήν. Ἐξ ἄνθους ὡς περκαζούσης σταφυλῆς, ηὐφράνθη ἡ καρδία μου ἐν αὐτῇ· ἐπέβη δ' ὁ ποῦς μου ἐν εὐθύτητι, ἐκ νεότητός μου ἴχνευσον αὐτήν.
16 Ἔκλινα ὀλίγον τὸ οὖς μου καὶ ἐδεξάμην, καὶ πολλὴν εὗρον ἐμαυτῷ παιδείαν·
17 προκοπὴ ἐγένετό μοι ἐν αὐτῇ· τῷ διδόντι μοι σοφίαν,
18 δώσω δόξαν. Διενοήθην γὰρ τοῦ ποιῆσαί με αὐτήν, καὶ ἐζήλωσα τὸ ἀγαθόν,
19 καὶ οὐ μὴ αἰσχυνθῶ. Διαμεμάχηταί ἡ ψυχή μου ἐν αὐτῇ, καὶ ἐν ποιήσει μου διηκρίβωσάμην· τὰς χεῖράς μου
20 ἐξεπέτασα πρὸς ὕψος, καὶ τὰ ἀγνοήματα αὐτῆς ἐπένθησα. Τὴν ψυχήν μου κατεύθυνα εἰς αὐτήν, καὶ ἐν καθαρισμῷ εὗρον αὐτήν· καρδίαν ἐκτησάμην μετ᾿ αὐτῆς ἀπ᾿ ἀρχῆς· διὰ τοῦτο οὐ μὴ ἐγκα-
21 ταλειφθῶ. Καὶ ἡ κοιλία μου ἐταράχθη τοῦ ἐκζητῆσαι αὐτήν·
22 διὰ τοῦτο ἐκτησάμην ἀγαθὸν κτῆμα. Ἔδωκε Κύριος γλῶσσάν μου
23 μισθόν μου, καὶ ἐν αὐτῇ αἰνέσω αὐτόν. Ἐγγίσατε πρὸς με ἀπαίδευτοι,
24 καὶ αὐλίσθητε ἐν οἴκῳ παιδείας. Τί ὅτι ὑστερεῖτε, λέγετε,
25 ἐν τούτοις, καὶ αἱ ψυχαὶ ὑμῶν διψῶσι σφόδρα; Ἤνοιξα τὸ στόμα μου,
26 καὶ ἐλάλησα· κτήσασθε ἑαυτοῖς ἄνευ ἀργυρίου· τὸν τράχηλόν ὑμῶν ὑπόθετε ὑπὸ ζυγὸν καὶ ἐπιδεξάσθω ἡ ψυχὴ ὑμῶν
27 παιδείαν· ἐγγύς ἐστιν εὑρεῖν αὐτήν. Ἴδετε ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς ὑμῶν ὅτι
28 ὀλίγον ἐκοπίασα, καὶ εὗρον ἐμαυτῷ πολλὴν ἀνάπαυσιν. Μετάσχετε παιδείας ἐν πολλῷ ἀριθμῷ ἀργυρίου· καὶ πολὺν χρυσὸν
29 κτήσασθε ἐν αὐτῇ. Εὐφρανθείη ἡ ψυχὴ ὑμῶν ἐν τῷ ἐλέει αὐτοῦ,
30 καὶ μὴ αἰσχυνθείητε ἐν αἰνέσει αὐτοῦ. Ἐργάζεσθε τὸ ἔργον ὑμῶν
31 πρὸ καιροῦ, καὶ δώσει τὸν μισθὸν ὑμῶν ἐν καιρῷ αὐτοῦ.

ΣΟΦΙΑ ΙΗΣΟΥ ΥΙΟΥ ΣΕΙΡΑΧ.

**Chapter Fifty-One**

The Prayer of Jesus, Son of Sirach.

9 and dost save them from the hand of enemies.
And I lifted up my supplication from the earth,
10 and for a death-pronouncement did I plead.
I called upon the Lord, the Father of my Lord,
that He abandon me not in days of tribulation,
in the time of the proud, when there is no help.
11 I will praise Thy Name continually,
12 and will sing hymns in confession.
And my supplication was heard.
For Thou didst save me from destruction,
and didst rescue me from the hand of the wicked, (and didst rescue me).
Therefore will I confess unto Thee,
and will praise Thee, and
13 will bless the Name of the Lord.
Yet being younger, before I went astray,
14 I sought wisdom manifestly in my prayer.
Before the temple
15 I made petition concerning her,
and unto the last did I seek her.
From the blossom like a ripening grape,
my heart rejoiced in her;
and my foot stepped in uprightness.
From my youth, trace her out!
16 I inclined my ear a little, and received,
and found for myself much instruction.
17 Progression was made for me in her;
to Him that giveth me wisdom,
18 will I give glory.
For I purposed to make her mine,
and I was zealous for the good,
19 and I shall not be ashamed.
My soul hath striven mightily in her,
and in my doing I made careful inquiry.
My hands
20 I stretched forth unto the height,
and I mourned her ignorances.
My soul I directed unto her,
and in purification I found her.
A heart I acquired with her from the beginning;
therefore shall I not be forsaken.
21 And my inner being was troubled to seek her out;
22 therefore I acquired a good possession.
The Lord gave my tongue
23 my reward, and in it will I praise Him.
Draw near unto me, ye uninstructed,
24 and lodge in the house of instruction.
Why is it that ye lack, ye say,
25 in these things, and your souls do thirst exceedingly?
I opened my mouth,
26 and I spoke: Acquire for yourselves without money;
put your neck under the yoke,
and let your soul receive instruction;
27 it is near to find her.
See with your own eyes that
28 I have toiled a little,
and found for myself much rest.
Take part in instruction with much silver;
29 and acquire much gold in her.
30 May your soul rejoice in His mercy,
and be not ashamed in His praise.
31 Work your work before the time,
and He shall give your reward in its time.

THE WISDOM OF JESUS, SON OF SIRACH.
