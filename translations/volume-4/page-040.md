ΚΕΦ. ΙΑ΄.
ἠκούσαμεν τὰ ῥήματα αὐτοῦ, ὅτι πεποιήσαντο αὐτὸν οἱ ἄν-
δρες Βετυλούα, καὶ ἀνήγγειλεν αὐτοῖς πάντα ὅσα ἐξελάλησε παρὰ
σοί. Διό, δέσποτα κύριε, μὴ παρέλθῃς τὸν λόγον αὐτοῦ, ἀλλὰ 10
κατάθου αὐτὸν ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ σου, ὅτι ἔστιν ἀληθής. οὐ γὰρ ἐκδι-
κᾶται τὸ γένος ἡμῶν, οὐ κατισχύει ῥομφαία ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς, ἐὰν μὴ
ἁμάρτωσιν εἰς τὸν Θεὸν αὐτῶν. Καὶ νῦν ἵνα μὴ γένηται ὁ κύ- 11
ριός μου ἔκβολος καὶ ἄπρακτος, καὶ ἐπιπέσεται θάνατος ἐπὶ πρό-
σωπον αὐτῶν, καὶ καταλάβοι αὐτοὺς ἁμάρτημα ἐν ᾧ παροργιοῦ-
σι τὸν Θεὸν αὐτῶν, ὑπηγίκα ἐὰν ποιήσωσιν ἀτοπίαν. Ἐπεὶ γὰρ 12
ἐξέλιπεν αὐτοὺς τὰ βρώματα αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐσπανίσθη πᾶν ὕδωρ,
ἐβουλεύσαντο ἐπιβαλεῖν τοῖς κτήνεσιν αὐτῶν, καὶ πάντα ὅσα διε-
στείλατο αὐτοῖς ὁ Θεὸς ἐν τοῖς νόμοις αὐτοῦ μὴ φαγεῖν, διέ-
γνωσαν δαπανῆσαι. Καὶ τὰς ἀπαρχὰς τοῦ σίτου, καὶ τὰς δεκά- 13
τας τοῦ οἴνου καὶ τοῦ ἐλαίου, ἃ διεφύλαξαν ἁγιάσαντες τοῖς
ἱερεῦσι τοῖς παρεστηκόσιν ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἀπέναντι τοῦ προσώ-
που τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν, κεκρίκασιν ἐξαναλῶσαι, ὧν οὐδὲν ταῖς χερ-
σὶ καθῆκεν ἅψασθαι οὐδένα τῶν ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ. Καὶ ἀπεστάλκασιν 14
εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ, ὅτι καὶ οἱ ἐκεῖ κατοικοῦντες ἐποίησαν ταῦτα,
τοὺς μετοικίσαντας αὐτοῖς τὴν ἄφεσιν παρὰ τῆς γερουσίας. Καὶ 15
ἔσται ὡς ἐὰν ἀναγγείλῃ αὐτοῖς καὶ ποιήσωσι, δοθήσονταί σοι εἰς
ὄλεθρον ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ. Ὅθεν ἐγὼ ἡ δούλη σου ἐπιγνοῦσα 16
ταῦτα πάντα, ἀπέδρων ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτῶν, καὶ ἀπέστειλέ με
ὁ Θεὸς ποιῆσαι μετὰ σοῦ πράγματα, ἐφ᾿ οἷς ἐκστήσεται πᾶσα ἡ
γῆ, ὅσοι ἐὰν ἀκούσωσιν αὐτά. Ὅτι ἡ δούλη σου θεοσεβὴς ἐστι, 17
καὶ θεραπεύουσα νυκτὸς καὶ ἡμέρας τὸν Θεὸν τοῦ οὐρανοῦ· καὶ
νῦν μενῶ παρά σοι, Κύριέ μου, καὶ ἐξελεύσεται ἡ δούλη σου κατὰ
νύκτα εἰς τὴν φάραγγα, καὶ προσεύξομαι πρὸς τὸν Θεόν· καὶ ἀ-
ναγγελεῖ μοι πότε ἐποίησαν τὰ ἁμαρτήματα αὐτῶν· καὶ ἐλθοῦσα 18
προσανοίσω σοι, καὶ ἐξελεύσῃ σὺν πάσῃ τῇ δυνάμει σου, καὶ οὐκ
ἔστιν ὃς ἀντιστήσεταί σοι ἐξ αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἄξω σε διὰ μέσου τῆς 19
Ἰουδαίας, ἕως τοῦ ἐλθεῖν ἀπέναντι Ἱερουσαλήμ· καὶ θήσω τὸν
δίφρον σου ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῆς, καὶ ἄξεις αὐτοὺς ὡς πρόβατα οἷς οὐκ
ἔστι ποιμήν· καὶ οὐ γρύξει κύων τῇ γλώσσῃ αὐτοῦ ἀπέναντί σου,
ὅτι μοι ταῦτα ἐλαλήθη κατὰ πρόγνωσίν μου, καὶ ἀνηγγέλη μοι,
καὶ ἀπεστάλην ἀναγγεῖλαί σοι. Καὶ ἤρεσαν οἱ λόγοι αὐτῆς ἐνάν- 20
τιον Ὁλοφέρνου, καὶ ἐναντίον πάντων τῶν θεραπόντων αὐτοῦ,

#### CHAPTER 11

**9** ...we have heard his words, that the men of Bethulia dealt with him, and he reported unto them all that he spake before thee.

**10** Wherefore, my Lord Commander, let not his word pass by thee, but lay it up within thy heart, for it is true. For our race is not avenged, neither doth the sword prevail against them, unless they sin against their God.

**11** And now, lest my lord become rejected and ineffectual, and death fall upon their face, and [lest] sin overtake them, in that they shall provoke their God to wrath, what time they shall commit folly.

**12** For since their food failed them, and all water was made scarce, they have purposed to fall upon their cattle, and all things which God hath commanded them by His laws not to eat, they have resolved to consume.

**13** Yea, even the firstfruits of the grain, and the tithes of the wine and of the oil, which they had kept sanctified for the priests who stand in Jerusalem before the face of our God, these have they determined to consume; of which none of the people was fitting to touch with [their] hands.

**14** And they have sent unto Jerusalem, [declaring] that even those dwelling there have done these things, [namely, they] who for them had caused the permission to be transferred from the elders.

**15** And it shall come to pass, that if they shall report unto them and they shall do [it], they shall be given unto thee for destruction in that day.

**16** Wherefore, I, thy handmaiden, having come to know all these things, have fled from their presence; and God hath sent me to do with thee such things, at which all the earth shall be astonished, as many as shall hear them.

**17** For thy handmaiden is God-fearing, and worshippeth the God of heaven by night and by day; and now I shall abide with thee, my lord, and thy handmaiden shall go forth by night into the ravine, and I will pray unto God; and He shall declare unto me when they have committed their sins.

**18** And when I am come, I will report unto thee, and thou shalt go forth with all thy might, and there shall be none among them who shall resist thee.

**19** And I shall lead thee through the midst of Judea, until thou come before Jerusalem; and I shall set thy chariot in the midst thereof, and thou shalt lead them as sheep which have no shepherd; and no dog shall growl with his tongue before thee, for these things have been spoken unto me according to my foreknowledge, and they have been declared unto me, and I have been sent to declare them unto thee.

**20** And her words were pleasing before Holofernes, and before all his servants,
