KEΦ. Δ΄.                                  ΜΑΚΚΑΒΑΙΩΝ Α΄.                                 1621
καὶ αἰσχυνθήτωσαν ἐπὶ τῇ δυνάμει καὶ τῇ ἵππῳ αὐτῶν. Δὸς αὐ- 32
τοῖς δειλίαν, καὶ τῆξον θράσος αὐτῶν, καὶ σαλευθήτωσαν
τῇ συντριβῇ αὐτῶν. Κατάβαλε αὐτοὺς ῥομφαίᾳ ἀγαπώντων σε, 33
καὶ αἰνεσάτωσάν σε πάντες οἱ εἰδότες τὸ ὄνομά σου ἐν ὕμνοις.
Καὶ συνέβαλεν ἀλλήλοις, καὶ ἔπεσον ἐκ τῆς παρεμβολῆς Λυσίου 34
εἰς πεντακισχιλίους ἄνδρας, καὶ ἔπεσεν ἐξ ἐναντίας αὐτῶν. Ἰδὼν δὲ 35
Λυσίας τὴν γενομένην τροπὴν τῆς αὐτοῦ συντάξεως, τῆς δὲ Ἰού-
δα τὸ γεγεννημένον θάρσος, καὶ ὡς ἕτοιμοι εἰσιν ἢ ζῆν ἢ τεθνη-
κέναι γενναίως, ἀπῆρεν εἰς Ἀντιόχειαν, καὶ ἐξενολόγει· καὶ πλεο-
νάσας τὸν πάλιν γενηθέντα στρατὸν ἐλογίζετο πάλιν παραγενέ-
σθαι εἰς τὴν Ἰουδαίαν. Εἶπε δὲ Ἰούδας καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ· 36
Ἰδοὺ συνετρίβησαν οἱ ἐχθροὶ ἡμῶν, ἀναβῶμεν καθαρίσαι τὰ ἅγια
καὶ ἐγκαινίσαι. Καὶ συνήχθη ἡ παρεμβολὴ πᾶσα, καὶ ἀνέβησαν 37
εἰς ὄρος Σιὼν. Καὶ ἴδον τὸ ἁγίασμα ἡμῶν ἠρημωμένον, καὶ τὸ 38
θυσιαστήριον βεβηλωμένον, καὶ τὰς πύλας κατακεκαυμένας, καὶ
ἐν ταῖς αὔλαις φυτὰ πεφυκότα, ὡς ἐν δρυμῷ ἢ ὡς ἐν ἑνὶ τῶν
ὀρέων, καὶ τὰ παστοφόρια καθηρημένα. Καὶ διέρρηξαν τὰ ἱμά- 39
τια αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐκόψαντο κοπετὸν μέγαν, καὶ ἐπέθεντο σποδὸν
ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἔπεσον ἐπὶ πρόσωπον ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, 40
καὶ ἐσάλπισαν ταῖς σάλπιξι τῶν σημασιῶν, καὶ ἐβόησαν εἰς οὐ-
ρανόν. Τότε ἐπέταξεν Ἰούδας ἀνδράσι πολεμεῖν τοὺς ἐν τῇ ἀ- 41
κρα, ἕως ἂν καθαρίσῃ τὰ ἅγια. Καὶ ἐπέλεξεν ἱερεῖς ἀμώμους 42
θελητὰς νόμου. Καὶ ἐκαθάρισαν τὰ ἅγια, καὶ ἦραν τοὺς λίθους 43
τοῦ μιασμοῦ εἰς τόπον ἀκάθαρτον. Καὶ ἐβουλεύσαντο περὶ τοῦ 44
θυσιαστηρίου τῆς ὁλοκαυτώσεως τοῦ βεβηλωμένου, τί αὐτῷ ποιή-
σωσι. Καὶ ἔπεσεν αὐτοῖς βουλὴ ἀγαθή, καθελεῖν αὐτό, μή ποτε 45
γένηται αὐτοῖς εἰς ὄνειδος. ἔτι ἐμίαναν τὰ ἔθνη αὐτό, καὶ κα-
θεῖλον τὸ θυσιαστήριον. Καὶ ἀπέθεντο τοὺς λίθους ἐν τῷ ὄρει 46
τοῦ οἴκου ἐν τόπῳ ἐπιτηδείῳ μέχρι τοῦ παραγεννηθῆναι προφή-
την τοῦ ἀποκριθῆναι περὶ αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἔλαβον λίθους ὁλοκλήρους 47
κατὰ τὸν νόμον, καὶ ῳκοδόμησαν τὸ θυσιαστήριον καινὸν κατὰ
τὸ πρότερον. Καὶ ῳκοδόμησαν τὰ ἅγια καὶ τὰ ἐντὸς τοῦ οἴκου, 48
καὶ τὰς αὔλας ἡγίασαν. Καὶ ἐποίησαν τὰ σκεύη τὰ ἅγια καινὰ, 49
καὶ εἰσήνεγκαν τὴν λυχνίαν καὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον τῶν ὁλοκαυτω-
μάτων καὶ θυμιαμάτων καὶ τὴν τράπεζαν εἰς τὸν ναόν. Καὶ 50
ἐθυμίασαν ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον, καὶ ἐξῆψαν τοὺς λύχνους τοὺς

**33** Cast them down by the sword of those who love Thee, and let all those who know Thy Name praise Thee with hymns."
**34** And [Judas] joined battle with them; and there fell of the host of Lysias about five thousand men, and he was defeated before them.
**35** But Lysias, perceiving the rout that had befallen his own array, and the courage which had been engendered in Judas' [men], and how ready they were either to live or to die nobly, departed for Antioch. And he levied foreign troops, and having increased the army which had again come forth, he purposed again to come into Judea.
**36** Then Judas and his brethren said, "Behold, our enemies are crushed; let us go up and purify the holy places, and rededicate them."
**37** And the whole camp was gathered together, and they went up unto Mount Zion.
**38** And they beheld our sanctuary, how it lay desolate, and the Altar defiled, and the gates burned with fire; and in the courts there had grown up plants, as in a thicket or as upon one of the mountains, and the store-chambers were pulled down.
**39** And they rent their garments, and made a great lamentation, and cast ashes upon their heads.
**40** And they fell upon their faces to the ground, and sounded with the trumpets of alarm, and cried aloud unto Heaven.
**41** Then Judas commanded men to fight against those who were in the citadel, until he should purify the holy places.
**42** And he chose blameless priests, who were zealous for the Law.
**43** And they purified the holy places, and carried forth the defiled stones unto an unclean place.
**44** And they took counsel concerning the Altar of Burnt Offerings, which had been defiled, [as to] what they should do with it.
**45** And a good counsel came unto them, to pull it down, lest it should ever become a reproach unto them, because the Gentiles had defiled it; and so they pulled down the Altar.
**46** And they laid up the stones in the mountain of the house, in a convenient place, until a prophet should arise to give them answer concerning them.
**47** And they took whole stones, according to the Law, and built a new altar according to the former [one].
**48** And they built the holy places, and that which was within the house, and sanctified the courts.
**49** And they made new the holy vessels; and they brought the Lampstand, and the Altar of Burnt Offerings and of Incense, and the Table into the Temple.
**50** And they offered incense upon the Altar, and lit the lamps which
