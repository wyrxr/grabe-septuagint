33 ἀμφοτέρων ὁ λογισμὸς ἐπικρατεῖν φαίνεται. ᾿Επεὶ πόθεν κινούμενοι
πρὸς τὰς ἀπειρημένας τροφάς, ἀποτρεπόμεθα τὰς ἐξ ἑαυτῶν ἡδο-
νάς; οὐχ ὅτι δύναται τῶν ὀρέξεων ἐπικρατεῖν ὁ λογισμός; ἐγὼ
34 μὲν οἶμαι. Τοιγαροῦν ἐνύδρων ἐπιθυμοῦντες καὶ ὀρνέων καὶ τε-
τραπόδων, καὶ παντοίων βρωμάτων τῶν ἀπηγορευμένων ἡμῖν κατὰ
35 τὸν νόμον ἀπεχόμεθα διὰ τὴν τοῦ λογισμοῦ ἐπικράτειαν. ᾿Αντέ-
χεται γὰρ τὰ τῶν ὀρέξεων πάθη ὑπὸ τοῦ σώφρονος νοὸς ἀνακαμ-
πτόμενα˙ καὶ φιμοῦται πάντα τὰ τοῦ σώματος κινήματα ὑπὸ τοῦ
λογισμοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. Β´. ΙΙ.

1 ΚΑΙ τί θαυμαστόν; εἰ αἱ τῆς ψυχῆς ἐπιθυμίαι πρὸς τὴν τοῦ
2 κάλλους μετουσίαν ἀκυροῦνται. Ταύτῃ γοῦν ὁ σώφρων ᾿Ιωσὴφ
ἐπαινεῖται, ὅτι τῷ λογισμῷ , καὶ τῇ διανοίᾳ περιεκράτησε τῆς
3 ἡδυπαθείας. Νέος γὰρ ὢν καὶ ἀκμάζων πρὸς συνουσιασμὸν ἠκύ-
4 ρωσε τῷ λογισμῷ τὸν τῶν παθῶν οἶστρον. Οὐ μόνον δὲ τὴν
τῆς ἡδυπαθείας οἰσφηλασίαν ἐπικρατεῖν ὁ λογισμὸς φαίνεται, ἀλ-
5 λὰ καὶ πάσης ἐπιθυμίας. Λέγει γοῦν ὁ νόμος˙ οὐκ ἐπιθυμήσεις
τὴν γυναῖκα τοῦ πλησίον σου, οὐδὲ ὅσα τοῦ πλησίον σου ἐστίν.
6 Καίτοι ὅτε μὴ ἐπιθυμεῖν ἡμᾶς εἴρηκεν ὁ νόμος, πολὺ πλέον πεί-
σαιμ᾽ ἂν ὑμᾶς, ὅτι τῶν ἐπιθυμιῶν κρατεῖν δύναται ὁ λογισμός,
7 ὥσπερ καὶ τῶν κωλυτικῶν τῆς δικαιοσύνης παθῶν. ᾿Επεὶ τίνα
τρόπον μονόφαγος τις ὢν τὸ ἦθος, καὶ γαστρίμαργος, καὶ μέθυ-
σος, μεταπαιδεύεται, εἰ μὴ δῆλον , ὅτι κύριός ἐστι τῶν παθῶν
8 ὁ λογισμός; Αὐτίκα γοῦν τῷ νόμῳ πολιτευόμενος, κἂν φιλάρ-
γυρός τις ᾖ, βιάζεται τὸν ἑαυτοῦ τρόπον, τοῖς δεομένοις δανεί-
ζων χωρίς τόκων, καὶ τὸ δάνειον τῶν ἑβδομάδων ἐνστάσεων χρεο-
9 κοπούμενος. Κἂν φειδωλός τις ᾖ, ὑπὸ τοῦ νόμου κρατεῖται˙ διὰ
τὸν λογισμόν, μήτε ἐπικαρπολογούμενος τοὺς ἀμητοὺς, μήτε ἐ-
πιῤῥωγολογούμενος τοὺς ἀμπελῶνας, καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν ἑτέρων ἐστιν
10 ἐπιγνῶναι τοῦτο, ὅτι τῶν παθῶν ἐστιν ὁ λογισμὸς κρατῶν. ῾Ο
γὰρ νόμος καὶ τῆς πρὸς γονεῖς εὐνοίας κρατεῖ, μὴ καταπροδιδούς
11 τὴν ἀρετὴν δι᾽ αὐτοὺς˙ καὶ τῆς πρὸς γαμετὴν φιλίας ἐπικρατεῖ,
12 διὰ παρανομίαν αὐτὴν ἀπελέγχων. Καὶ τῆς τέκνων φιλίας κυ-
ριεύει, διὰ κακίαν αὐτὰ κολάζων, καὶ τῆς φίλων συνηθείας δεσπό-
13 ζει, διὰ πονηρίαν αὐτοὺς ἐξελέγχων. Καὶ μὴ νομίσητε παρά-

**CHAPTER I.**

**33** over both of these Reason is seen to prevail. For from whence, being moved toward forbidden foods, do we turn away from the pleasures that arise from them? Is it not because Reason is able to prevail over appetites? I, for my part, do think so.
**34** Therefore, though we desire things of the waters, and of the fowls, and of the four-footed beasts, and all manner of meats forbidden unto us according to the Law, yet do we abstain, through the mastery of Reason.
**35** For the passions of the appetites are restrained by the temperate mind, being bent back; and all the movements of the body are muzzled by Reason.

**CHAPTER II.**

**1** And what is marvellous? if the desires of the soul are annulled concerning the partaking of [carnal] beauty.
**2** For this, then, is the temperate Joseph praised, because by Reason, and by understanding, he overcame lust.
**3** For being young and in the prime of life for carnal union, he annulled by Reason the mad impulse of the passions.
**4** And not only is Reason seen to prevail over the mad urge of lust, but also over every desire.
**5** For the Law doth say: "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor whatsoever is thy neighbor's."
**6** Yet, since the Law hath told us not to covet, much more would I persuade you that Reason is able to control desires,
**7** even as it doth also control the passions which hinder righteousness. For in what manner doth one, whose habit it is to eat to excess, and who is gluttonous, and a drunkard, become re-educated, unless it be manifest that Reason is master of the passions?
**8** Immediately then, one who lives according to the Law, even if he be avaricious, doth force his own nature, lending unto those who have need without usury, and cancelling the loan in the cycles of the seventh years.
**9** And if one be stingy, he is constrained by the Law through Reason, neither gathering the gleanings of the harvests, nor gathering the fallen grapes of the vineyards;
**10** and it is possible to perceive this also concerning others, that Reason doth master the passions. For the Law doth also govern the affection towards parents, not utterly betraying
**11** virtue on account of them;
**12** and it doth prevail over the love for a wife, reproving her for lawlessness. And it doth govern the love for children, punishing them for wickedness;
**13** and it doth rule over the companionship of friends, convicting them for malice. And think not that it is contrary to
