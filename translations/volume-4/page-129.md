ἐξ ἧς ἐξεπορεύοντο, καὶ ἐμίσχνον κύκλῳ τῶν ἁγίων, καὶ ἐποίουν
37 ὡς πληγὴν μεγάλην ἐν τῇ ἀγνείᾳ. Καὶ κατῴκισεν ἐν αὐτῇ
ἄνδρας Ἰουδαίους, καὶ ὠχύρωσεν αὐτὴν πρὸς ἀσφάλειαν τῆς χώ-
38 ρας καὶ τῆς πόλεως, καὶ ὕψωσε τὰ τείχη Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ
ὁ βασιλεὺς Δημήτριος ἔστησεν αὐτῷ τὴν ἀρχιερωσύνην κατὰ ταῦ-
39 τα, καὶ ἐποίησεν αὐτὸν τῶν φίλων αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐδόξασεν αὐτὸν
40 δόξῃ μεγάλῃ· ἔχουσι γὰρ ὅτι προσηγόρευονται Ἰουδαῖοι ὑπὸ Ῥω-
μαίων φίλοι καὶ σύμμαχοι καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοί, καὶ ὅτι ἀπήντησαν τοῖς
41 πρεσβευταῖς Σίμωνος ἐνδόξως· Καὶ ἔτι οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς
εὐδόκησαν τοῦ εἶναι αὐτῶν Σίμωνα ἡγούμενον καὶ ἀρχιερέα εἰς
42 τὸν αἰῶνα, ἕως τοῦ ἀναστῆναι προφήτην πιστόν· Καὶ τοῦ εἶναι
ἐπ᾿ αὐτῶν στρατηγόν, καὶ ὅπως μέλοι αὐτῷ περὶ τῶν ἁγίων
καθιστάναι αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ τῶν ἔργων αὐτῶν καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς χώρας
43 καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν ὅπλων καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν ὀχυρωμάτων· Καὶ ὅπως μέλοι
αὐτῷ περὶ τῶν ἁγίων, καὶ ὅπως ἀκούηται ὑπὸ πάντων, καὶ
ὅπως γράφωνται ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι αὐτοῦ πᾶσαι συγγραφαὶ ἐν τῇ
44 χώρᾳ, καὶ ὅπως περιβάλληται πορφύραν καὶ χρυσοφορῇ· Καὶ
οὐκ ἔξεστιν οὐδενὶ τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ τῶν ἱερέων ἀθετῆσαί τι τούτων
καὶ ἀντειπεῖν τοῖς ὑπ᾿ αὐτοῦ ῥηθησομένοις, καὶ ἐπισυστρέψαι συ-
στροφὴν ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ ἄνευ αὐτοῦ, καὶ περιβαλέσθαι πορφύραν καὶ
45 ἐμφορεῖσθαι πόρπην χρυσῆν· Ὃς δ᾿ ἂν παρὰ ταῦτα ποιήσῃ ἢ
46 ἀθετήσῃ τι τούτων, ἔνοχος ἔσται. Καὶ εὐδόκησε πᾶς ὁ λαὸς δέξα-
σθαι Σίμωνι καὶ ποιῆσαι κατὰ τοὺς λόγους τούτους. Καὶ ἐπε-
δέξατο Σίμων καὶ εὐδόκησεν ἀρχιερατεῦσαι καὶ εἶναι στρατηγὸς
καὶ ἐθνάρχης τῶν Ἰουδαίων καὶ ἱερέων καὶ τοῦ προστατῆσαι
48 πάντων. Καὶ τὴν γραφὴν ταύτην εἶπαν θέσθαι ἐν δέλτοις χαλ-
καῖς, καὶ στῆσαι αὐτὰς ἐν περιβόλῳ τῶν ἁγίων ἐν τόπῳ ἐπι-
49 σήμῳ. Τὰ δὲ ἀντίγραφα αὐτῶν θέσθαι ἐν τῷ γαζοφυλακίῳ, ὅπως
ἔχῃ Σίμων καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ.

**Chapter 14**
**37** from which they issued forth, and did mingle round about the holy [places], and did make as a great wound in the purity. And he settled in it Jewish men, and fortified it for the safety of the land and of the city,
**38** and did raise the walls of Jerusalem. And King Demetrius did confirm unto him the High Priesthood according to these things,
**39** and made him one of his friends, and did glorify him with great glory;
**40** for they knew that the Jews are called by the Romans friends and allies and brethren; and that they had met the ambassadors of Simon with honor.
**41** And furthermore, the Jews and the priests were pleased that Simon should be their leader and High Priest forever,
**42** until a faithful prophet should arise. And that he should be general over them, and that he should have care concerning the holy things, [empowered] to appoint them over their works and over the land
**43** and over the weapons and over the fortifications; And that he should have care concerning the holy things, and that he should be obeyed by all, and that all writings in the land should be set down in his name,
**44** and that he should wear purple and bear gold. And it is not lawful for any of the people or of the priests to set aside any of these things,
**45** or to speak against that which shall be spoken by him, or to gather a faction in the land without him, or to wear purple and to bear a golden clasp. Whosoever shall do contrary to these things,
**46** or shall set aside any of them, shall be guilty. And all the people were pleased to assent unto Simon, and to do according to these words.
**47** And Simon did accept and was pleased to be High Priest, and to be general and ethnarch of the Jews and priests, and to be the protector of all.
**48** And they commanded that this writing should be placed upon bronze tablets, and that they should be set up in the enclosure of the holy places in a conspicuous place.
**49** And the copies thereof were to be placed in the treasury, that Simon and his sons might have them.' "

**Chapter 15**
**1** And Antiochus, the son of King Demetrius, sent letters from the islands of the sea unto Simon the priest and ethnarch of the Jews,
