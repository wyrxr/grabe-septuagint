πατέρες ἡμῶν ἀπὸ τοῦ αἰῶνος· μνήσθητι, παιδίον, ὅτι οὗτοι
πάντες ἔλαβον γυναῖκας ἐκ τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ ηὐλογήθησαν
ἐν τοῖς τέκνοις αὐτῶν, καὶ τὸ σπέρμα αὐτῶν κληρονομήσει
13 γῆν. Καὶ νῦν, παιδίον, ἀγάπα τοὺς ἀδελφούς σου, καὶ μὴ ὑ-
περφανεύου τῇ καρδίᾳ σου ἀπὸ τῶν ἀδελφῶν σου, καὶ τῶν υἱῶν
καὶ θυγατέρων τοῦ λαοῦ σου, λαβεῖν σεαυτῷ ἐξ αὐτῶν γυναῖ-
κα· διότι ἐν τῇ ὑπερηφανίᾳ ἀπώλεια καὶ ἀκαταστασία πολλή,
καὶ ἐν τῇ ἀχρειότητι ἐλάττωσις καὶ ἔνδεια μεγάλη· ἡ γὰρ ἀ-
χρειότης μήτηρ ἐστι τοῦ λιμοῦ. Μισθὸς παντὸς ἀνθρώπου ὃς ἐὰν
14 ἐργάζηται, παρὰ σοὶ μὴ αὐλισθήτω, ἀλλὰ ἀπόδος αὐτῷ παραυ-
τίκα. Καὶ ἐὰν δουλεύσῃς τῷ Θεῷ, ἀποδοθήσεταί σοι. πρόσεχε
σεαυτῷ, παιδίον, ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς ἔργοις σου, καὶ ἴσθι πεπαιδευμέ-
15 νος ἐν πάσῃ ἀναστροφῇ σου. Καὶ ὃ μισεῖς, μηδενὶ ποιήσῃς· οἶ-
νον εἰς μέθην μὴ πίνῃς, καὶ μὴ πορευθήτω μετὰ σοῦ μέθη ἐν τῇ
16 ὁδῷ σου. Ἐκ τοῦ ἄρτου σου διαδίδου πεινῶντι, καὶ ἐκ τῶν ἱμα-
τίων σου τοῖς γυμνοῖς· πᾶν ὃ ἐὰν περισσεύῃ σοι, ποίει ἐλεημοσύ-
νην, καὶ μὴ φθονεσάτω σου ὁ ὀφθαλμὸς ἐν τῷ ποιεῖν ἐλεημοσύ-
17 νην. Ἔκχεον τοὺς ἄρτους σου ἐπὶ τὸν τάφον τῶν δικαίων, καὶ
18 μὴ δῷς τοῖς ἁμαρτωλοῖς. Συμβουλίαν παρὰ παντὸς φρονίμου
ζήτησον, καὶ μὴ μεταφρονήσῃς ἐπὶ πάσης συμβουλίας χρησίμης.
19 Καὶ ἐν παντὶ καιρῷ εὐλόγει Κύριον τὸν Θεόν, καὶ παρ᾽ αὐτοῦ
αἴτησον, ὅπως αἱ ὁδοί σου εὐθεῖαι γένωνται, καὶ πᾶσαι αἱ τρίβοι
καὶ αἱ βουλαί σου εὐοδωθῶσι· διότι πᾶν ἔθνος οὐκ ἔχει βουλήν,
ἀλλὰ αὐτὸς ὁ Κύριος δίδωσι πάντα τὰ ἀγαθά, καὶ ὃν ἐὰν θέλῃ,
ταπεινοῖ καθὼς βούλεται. καὶ νῦν, παιδίον, μνημόνευε τῶν ἐν-
20 τολῶν μου, καὶ μὴ ἐξαλειφθήτωσαν ἐκ τῆς καρδίας σου. Καὶ νῦν
ὑποδεικνύω σοι τὰ δέκα τάλαντα τοῦ ἀργυρίου, ἃ παρεθέμην Γα-
21 βαήλῳ τῷ τοῦ Γαβρία ἐν Ῥάγοις τῆς Μηδίας. Καὶ μὴ φοβοῦ,
παιδίον, ὅτι ἐπτωχεύσαμεν· ὑπάρχει σοι πολλά, ἐὰν φοβηθῇς τὸν
Κύριον, καὶ ἀποστῇς ἀπὸ πάσης ἁμαρτίας, καὶ ποιήσῃς τὸ ἀ-
ρεστὸν ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. Ε´. V.

1 ΚΑΙ ἀποκριθεὶς Τωβίας, εἶπεν αὐτῷ· πάτερ, ποιήσω πάντα
2 ὅσα ἐντέταλσαί μοι. Ἀλλὰ πῶς δυνήσομαι λαβεῖν τὸ ἀργύριον,
3 καὶ οὐ γινώσκω αὐτόν ;

[Tobit 4:12 continued]
...our fathers from ages past. Remember, my child, that all these took them wives of their brethren, and they were blessed in their children, and their seed shall inherit the earth.

[Tobit 4:13]
And now, my child, love thy brethren, and be not haughty in thy heart against thy brethren, nor against the sons and daughters of thy people, to take a wife for thyself from among them; for in pride there is destruction and much disorder, and in worthlessness there is diminishment and great want; for worthlessness is the mother of famine.

[Tobit 4:14]
Let not the wages of any man who laboureth tarry with thee, but render it unto him forthwith. And if thou serve God, it shall be rendered unto thee. Take heed to thyself, my child, in all thy works, and be thou instructed in all thy manner of life.

[Tobit 4:15]
And that which thou hatest, do thou to no man; drink not wine unto drunkenness, and let not drunkenness accompany thee on thy way.

[Tobit 4:16]
From thy bread give unto the hungry, and from thy garments unto the naked; whatsoever doth abound unto thee, give alms, and let not thine eye be envious when thou givest alms.

[Tobit 4:17]
Pour forth thy bread upon the grave of the righteous, and give not unto sinners.

[Tobit 4:18]
Seek counsel from every man of understanding, and despise not any profitable counsel.

[Tobit 4:19]
And at all times bless the Lord God, and from Him ask, that thy ways may be made straight, and all thy paths and thy counsels may prosper; for no nation hath counsel [of its own], but the Lord Himself doth give all good things, and whomsoever He willeth, He humbleth as it pleaseth Him. And now, my child, remember my commandments, and let them not be blotted out from thy heart.

[Tobit 4:20]
And now I declare unto thee the ten talents of silver, which I deposited with Gabael, [even] the son of Gabrias, in Rages of Media.

[Tobit 4:21]
And fear not, my child, that we are made poor; much remaineth unto thee, if thou fear the Lord, and depart from all sin, and do that which is pleasing in His sight.

**Chapter 5**

[Tobit 5:1]
And Tobias answered, and said unto him, "Father, I will do all things whatsoever thou hast commanded me.

[Tobit 5:2]
But how shall I be able to receive the silver, for I know him not?"
