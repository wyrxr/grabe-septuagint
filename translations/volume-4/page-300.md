**ΚΕΦ. ΛΕ΄.**

12 δικόν σου, καὶ μὴ ῥαθύμει· ἐκεῖ παῖζε καὶ ποίει τὰ ἐνθυμήματά σου, καὶ μὴ ἐν ἁμαρτίαις καὶ λόγῳ ὑπερηφάνῳ.
13 Καὶ ἐπὶ τούτοις εὐλόγησον τὸν ποιήσαντά σε, καὶ μεθύσκοντά σε ἀπὸ τῶν ἀγαθῶν αὐτοῦ.
14 Ὁ φοβούμενος Κύριον ἐκδέξεται παιδείαν αὐτοῦ, καὶ οἱ ὀρθρίζοντες εὑρήσουσιν εὐδοκίαν·
15 ὁ ζητῶν νόμον ἐμπλησθήσεται αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὁ ὑποκρινόμενος σκανδαλισθήσεται ἐν αὐτῷ·
16 οἱ φοβούμενοι Κύριον εὑρήσουσι κρίμα, καὶ δικαιώματα ὡς φῶς ἐξάψουσιν.
17 Ἄνθρωπος ἁμαρτωλὸς ἐκκλίνει ἐλεγμόν, καὶ κατὰ τὸ θέλημα αὐτοῦ εὑρήσει σύγκριμα.
18 Ἀνὴρ βουλῆς οὐ μὴ παρίδῃ διανόημα· ἀλλότριος καὶ ὑπερήφανος οὐ καταπτήξει φόβον, καὶ μετὰ τὸ ποιῆσαι μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ ἄνευ βουλῆς.
19 Ἄνευ βουλῆς μηδὲν ποιήσῃς, καὶ ἐν τῷ ποιῆσαί σε μὴ μεταμελοῦ.
20 Ἐν ὁδῷ ἀντιπτώματος μὴ πορεύου, καὶ μὴ προσκόψῃς ἐν λιθώδεσιν·
21 καὶ μὴ πιστεύσῃς ἐν ὁδῷ ἀπροσκόπῳ· καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν τέκνων σου φύλαξαι.
22 Ἐν παντὶ ἔργῳ ἀγαθῷ πίστευε τῇ ψυχῇ σου·
23 καὶ γὰρ τοῦτό ἐστι τήρησις ἐντολῆς.
24 Ὁ πιστεύων νόμῳ προσέχει ἐντολαῖς· καὶ ὁ πεποιθὼς Κυρίῳ οὐκ ἐλαττωθήσεται.

**ΚΕΦ. ΛΣΤ΄. XXXVI.**

1 Τῷ φοβουμένῳ Κύριον οὐκ ἀπαντήσει κακόν, ἀλλ᾽ ἐν πειρασμῷ καὶ πάλιν ἐξελεῖται αὐτόν.
2 Ἀνὴρ σοφὸς οὐ μισήσει νόμον· ὁ δὲ ὑποκρινόμενος ἐν αὐτῷ, ὡς ἐν καταιγίδι πλεῖον.
3 Ἄνθρωπος συνετὸς ἐμπιστεύσει νόμῳ, καὶ ὁ νόμος αὐτῷ πιστὸς ὡς ἐρώτημα δῆλον.
4 Ἑτοίμασον λόγον, καὶ οὕτως ἀκουσθήσῃ· σύνδησον παιδείαν καὶ ἀποκρίθητι.
5 Τροχὸς ἁμάξης σπλάγχνα μωροῦ, καὶ ὡς ἄξων στρεφόμενος ὁ διαλογισμὸς αὐτοῦ.
6 Ἵππος εἰς ὑγείαν ὡς φίλος μωκός, ὑποκάτω παντὸς ἐπικαθημένου χρεμετίσει.
7 Διατί ἡμέρα ἡμέρας ὑπερέχει; Καὶ πᾶν φῶς ἡμέρας ἐνιαυτοῦ ἀφ᾽ ἡλίου·
8 ἐν γνώσει Κυρίου διεχωρίσθησαν, καὶ ἠλλοίωσε καιροὺς καὶ ἑορτάς·
9 ἀπ᾽ αὐτῶν ἀνύψωσε καὶ ἡγίασε, καὶ ἐξ αὐτῶν ἔθηκεν εἰς ἀριθμὸν ἡμερῶν.
10 Καὶ ἄνθρωποι πάντες ἀπὸ ἐδάφους, καὶ ἐκ γῆς ἐκτίσθη Ἀδάμ·
11 ἐν πλήθει ἐπιστήμης Κύριος διεχώρισεν αὐτούς,
12 καὶ ἠλλοίωσε τὰς ὁδοὺς αὐτῶν· ἐξ αὐτῶν ηὐλόγησε καὶ ἀνύψωσε,
13 καὶ ἐξ αὐτῶν ἡγίασε, καὶ πρὸς αὐτῶν ἤγγισεν· ἀπ᾽ αὐτῶν κατηράσατο καὶ ἐταπείνωσεν, καὶ ἀνέστρεψεν αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ στάσεως.

**Chapter Thirty-Five (continued)**

12 thine own, and be not slothful:
    there disport thyself and attend to thy reflections,
    yet not in sins nor in proud speech.
13 And in all these things bless Him that made thee,
    and that doth satiate thee with His good things.
14 He that feareth the Lord shall receive His discipline,
    and they that rise early [to seek Him] shall find His good pleasure.
15 He that seeketh the Law shall be filled therewith,
    but he that plays the hypocrite shall be made to stumble therein.
16 They that fear the Lord shall find [right] judgment,
    and His righteous ordinances shall they kindle as light.
17 A sinful man turneth away from reproof,
    and according to his own will shall he find condemnation.
18 A man of counsel shall not disregard a thought;
    but the alien and proud [man] shall not be cowed by fear,
    even after he hath acted by himself without counsel.
19 Without counsel do thou nothing;
    and when thou hast done, regret it not.
20 In a way of stumbling, walk thou not;
    and stumble thou not upon rocky places.
21 And trust thou not in an unobstructed path;
    and from thy children guard thyself.
22 In every good work, commit thou thy soul thereto;
23 for this it is, [even] the keeping of a commandment.
24 He that believeth the Law giveth heed to the commandments;
    and he that trusteth in the Lord shall not suffer loss.

**Chapter Thirty-Six**

1 To him that feareth the Lord shall no evil happen;
    but in temptation, He shall yet again deliver him.
2 A wise man shall not hate the Law;
    but he that playeth the hypocrite therein, [is] yet more [troubled], as in a storm.
3 A man of understanding shall trust in the Law;
    and the Law [shall be] faithful unto him, as a manifest oracle.
4 Prepare thy words, and so shalt thou be heard;
    marshal thy instruction and make answer.
5 The wheel of a wagon are the inner parts of a fool,
    and as a turning axle [is] his reasoning.
6 A horse for health [is] as a mocking friend,
    for it shall neigh beneath every one that sitteth upon it.
7 Wherefore doth one day excel another?
    Yet all the light of a day of the year [cometh] from the sun.
8 By the knowledge of the Lord were they divided,
    and He changed seasons and feasts.
9 From among them He exalted and sanctified [some],
    and from among them He set [them] in the number of days.
10 And all men [are] from the dust,
    and from the earth was Adam created.
11 By the abundance of His knowledge, the Lord divided them,
12 and He altered their ways.
    From among them He blessed and exalted [some],
13 and from among them He sanctified [others],
    and unto some of them He drew near;
    but from among them He cursed and humbled [others],
    and turned them back from their standing.
