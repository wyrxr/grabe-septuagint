ΚΕΦ. Αʹ.
συναποκρυβῶσι μετ᾿ αὐτῶν. Πῶς οὖν οὐκ εἰσὶ θεοί; οἳ οὔτε σώ-
ζουσιν αὐτοὺς ἐκ πολέμων, οὔτε ἐκ κακῶν. Ὑπάρχοντα γὰρ ξύ-
λινα καὶ περίχρυσα καὶ περιαργύρα γνωσθήσεται μετὰ ταῦτα,
ὅτι εἰσὶ ψευδῆ· ταῖς ἔθνεσι πᾶσι, τοῖς τε βασιλεῦσι φανερὸν ἐστὶ,
ὅτι οὐκ εἰσὶ θεοί· ἀλλὰ ἔργα χειρῶν ἀνθρώπων, καὶ οὐδὲν Θεοῦ
ἔργον ἐν αὐτοῖς ἐστὶ. Τίνι οὖν γνωστὸν οὐκ ἔσται, ὅτι οὐκ εἰσὶ
θεοί; Βασιλέα γὰρ χώρας οὐ μὴ ἀναστήσωσιν, οὔτε ὑετὸν ἀν-
θρώποις οὐ μὴ δῶσι, κρίσιν τε οὐ μὴ διακρίνωσιν αὐτῶν, οὐδὲ
μὴ ῥύσωνται ἀδικουμένων, ἀδύνατοι ὄντες, ὥσπερ αἱ κορῶναι αἱ
ἀναμέσον τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ τῆς γῆς· καὶ γὰρ ὅταν ἐμπέσῃ εἰς οἰ-
κίαν θεῶν ξυλίνων ἢ περιχρύσων ἢ περιαργύρων πῦρ, οἱ μὲν ἱε-
ρεῖς αὐτῶν φεύξονται καὶ διασωθήσονται, αὐτοὶ δὲ ὥσπερ δοκοὶ
μέσοι κατακαυθήσονται, βασιλεῖ τε καὶ πολεμίοις οὐ μὴ ἀντίσωσι.
Πῶς οὖν ἢ νομιστέον ἢ δεκτέον, ἔτι εἰσὶ θεοί; οὔτε ἀπὸ κλε-
πτῶν, οὔτε ἀπὸ ληστῶν οὐ μὴ διασωθῶσι, θεοὶ ξύλινοι , καὶ
περιάργυροι, καὶ περίχρυσοι. Ὧν οἱ ἰσχύοντες περιελοῦνται
τὸ χρυσίον καὶ τὸ ἀργύριον καὶ τὸν ἱματισμὸν τὸν περικεί-
μενον αὐτοῖς , καὶ ἀπελεύσονται ἔχοντες , οἱ δὲ ἑαυτοῖς οὐ
μὴ βοηθήσωσιν. Ὥστε κρεῖσσον εἶναι βασιλέα ἐπιδεικνύμενον τὴν
ἑαυτοῦ ἀνδρείαν, ἢ σκεῦος ἐν οἰκίᾳ χρήσιμον, ἐφ᾿ ᾧ χρήσεται ὁ
κτησάμενος , ἢ οἱ ψευδεῖς θεοί· ἢ καὶ θύρα ἐν οἰκίᾳ διασώζουσα
τὰ ἐν αὐτῇ ὄντα, ἢ οἱ ψευδεῖς θεοί· καὶ ξύλινος στῦλος ἐν βα-
σιλείοις, ἢ οἱ ψευδεῖς θεοί. Ἥλιος μὲν γὰρ καὶ σελήνη καὶ
ἄστρα ὄντα λαμπρά, καὶ ἀποστελλόμενα ἐπὶ χρείας, εὐήνικα ἐστὶν.
Ὡσαύτως καὶ ἀστραπὴ ὅταν ἐπιφανῇ, εὔοπτός ἐστὶ· τὸ δ᾿ αὐτὸ
πνεῦμα ἐν πάσῃ χώρᾳ πνεῖ. Καὶ νεφέλαις ὅταν ἐπιταγῇ ὑπὸ τοῦ
Θεοῦ ἐπιπορεύεσθαι ἐφ᾿ ὅλην τὴν οἰκουμένην, συντελοῦσι τὸ ταχ-
θέν. Τό τε πῦρ ἐξαποσταλὲν ἄνωθεν ἐξαναλῶσαι ὄρη καὶ δρυ-
μοὺς, ποιεῖ τὸ συνταχθέν· ταῦτα δὲ οὐδὲ ταῖς εἰδέαις, οὐδὲ ταῖς
δυνάμεσιν ἐνὶ αὐτῶν ἀμοιροῦμένα ἐστὶν. Ὅθεν οὔτε νομιστέον,
οὔτε ἐκδεκτέον, αὐτοὺς ὑπάρχειν θεοὺς, οὐ δυνατῶν ὄντων αὐ-
τῶν, οὔτε κρίσιν κρῖναι, οὔτε εὖ ποιεῖν ἀνθρώποις. Γνόντες οὖν
ὅτι οὐκ εἰσὶ θεοί, μὴ φοβηθῆτε αὐτοὺς, οὔτε γὰρ βασιλεῦσιν οὐ
μὴ ταράσσονται , οὔτε μὴ εὐλογήσουσι. Σημεῖά τε ἐν οὐρανῷ
καὶ ἐν ἔθνεσιν οὐ μὴ δείξωσιν· οὔτε ὡς ὁ ἥλιος οὐ μὴ ἐκλάμ-
ψουσιν , οὔτε μὴ φωτιοῦσιν ὡς ἡ σελήνη. Τὰ θηρία κρείττω ἐστὶν

**CHAPTER I.**

...they might hide themselves with them. How then are they no gods? They who neither save [their worshippers] from wars nor from evils.
For these things, being of wood, and plated with gold and plated with silver, shall be known hereafter, that they are false. Unto all the nations and unto the kings is it manifest that they are no gods, but works of the hands of men, and no work of God is in them. Unto whom then shall it not be known that they are no gods?
For a king of a country shall they in no wise raise up, nor shall they in no wise give rain unto men; neither shall they render judgment for them, nor shall they rescue the wronged, being impotent, even as the ravens which are betwixt heaven and earth.
For even when fire doth fall into a house of gods of wood, or plated with gold, or plated with silver, their priests indeed shall flee and shall be saved, but they themselves, as beams in the midst [of the fire], shall be burned up; and against a king and against enemies shall they in no wise make resistance.
How then ought it to be thought, or to be accepted, that they are yet gods? Neither from thieves nor from robbers shall they be delivered, these gods of wood, and plated with silver, and plated with gold.
From whom the strong ones shall strip away the gold and the silver and the raiment that doth adorn them, and shall depart possessing [them]; but they themselves shall in no wise help themselves.
So that it is better to be a king, displaying his own valor, than these false gods; or a useful vessel in a house, wherein the owner thereof shall make use [of it], than these false gods; or even a door in a house, preserving the things that are within it, than these false gods; and a wooden pillar in royal palaces, than these false gods.
For the sun and the moon and the stars, being bright, and sent forth for [their] appointed tasks, are obedient. Likewise, when the lightning doth appear, it is easily seen; and the same wind bloweth in every land. And when the clouds are commanded by God to journey forth over all the inhabited world, they do accomplish that which is appointed. And fire, sent forth from above to consume mountains and forests, doth that which is commanded. But these [idols] do not even partake of [their] forms, nor of [their] powers, in any one [of them].
Wherefore neither ought it to be thought, nor to be accepted, that they are gods, they being unable either to judge a cause or to do good unto men.
Knowing therefore that they are no gods, fear ye them not; for neither shall they in no wise trouble kings, nor shall they bless. And signs in heaven and among the nations shall they in no wise show; neither shall they shine forth as the sun, nor shall they give light as the moon. The beasts are better than them...
