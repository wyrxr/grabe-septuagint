νόθως, προθυμηθέντων ἡμῶν εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὸν ναὸν αὐτῶν, καὶ
τοῖς ἐκπρεπέσι καὶ καλλίστοις ἀναθήμασι τιμῆσαι, τύφοις φερό-
18 μενοι παλαιοτέροις, εἶρξαν ἡμᾶς τῆς εἰσόδου, ἀπολειπόμενοι τῆς
ἡμετέρας ἀλκῆς, διʼ ἣν ἔχομεν πρὸς ἅπαντας ἀνθρώπους φιλαν-
19 θρωπίαν. Τὴν δὲ αὐτῶν εἰς ἡμᾶς δυσμένειαν ἔκδηλον καθιστάν-

**III Maccabees, Chapter 3**

**17** of the accursed, who do never cease from their folly. But they, by word, did accept our presence, yet by deed did act basely; for when we were fain to enter into their temple, and to honour it with offerings both excellent and fair, they, being borne up by ancient arrogance,
**18** did hinder us from entering, falling short of our might, by which we show forth humanity unto all men.
**19** And making manifest their enmity against us, as they alone among all nations do insult kings and their own benefactors,
**20** they are willing to yield nothing genuine. But we, having endured their folly, and being brought forth with victory, and having dealt humanely with all nations in Egypt, did as was meet.
**21** And in these things, making known unto all their countrymen [our] forgiveness of past wrongs, both for the sake of the alliance and for the many matters entrusted unto them with simplicity, which, being neglected, they dared to alter; we did intend to make them worthy also of the citizenship of Alexandria, and to establish them as participants in the [sacred rites] for ever.
**22** But they, receiving [these offers] to the contrary, and with fervent malice having rejected the good, and ever inclining unto evil,
**23** did not only cast away the citizenship, which was beyond price, but also did abhor, both by word and by silence, the few among them who were genuinely well-disposed toward us; secretly plotting in every wise, through their most ignominious manner of life, to bring down our accomplishments with speed.
**24** Wherefore, being by proofs well convinced that these men are in every wise hostile unto us, and foreseeing lest, should any sudden turmoil hereafter arise, we might have these ungodly ones as traitors at our back, and as barbaric enemies;
**25** we have given command that, forthwith upon the receiving of this letter, ye do on the selfsame day send unto us, with insult and plunder, those that dwell [among you], with their wives and children, bound in chains of iron, on every side completely confined,
**26** unto an irreparable and ignominious slaughter, fitting for enemies. For when these shall have been punished together, it is certain that for all the time remaining our affairs shall be established in stability and in the best of dispositions.
**27** And whosoever shall conceal any of the Jews, from old man unto infant, and even unto those at the breast, shall be beaten to death with the most grievous tortures, with his whole household.
**28** And whosoever is willing to inform, for this cause shall he receive the property of him that falleth under judgement, and two thousand drachmas from the king’s treasury, and shall attain unto his freedom, and shall be crowned.
