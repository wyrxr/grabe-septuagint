ἐπιστήμην αὐτοῦ. Ἐν κρίσει Κυρίου τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ ἀπ᾽ ἀρχῆς, 26
καὶ ἀπὸ ποιήσεως αὐτῶν διέστειλε μερίδας αὐτῶν· ἐκόσμησεν 27
εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰς ἀρχὰς αὐτῶν εἰς γενεὰς αὐ-
τῶν· οὔτε ἐπόνησαν, οὔτε ἐκοπίασαν, καὶ οὐκ ἐξέλιπον ἀπὸ τῶν
ἔργων αὐτῶν· ἕκαστος τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἐξεθλίψεν, καὶ ἕως 28
αἰῶνος οὐκ ἀπειθήσουσι τοῦ ῥήματος αὐτοῦ. Καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα Κύ- 29
ριος ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ἐπέβλεψε, καὶ ἐνέπλησεν αὐτὴν τῶν ἀγαθῶν αὐ-
τοῦ· ψυχὴ παντὸς ζώου ἐκάλυψε τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτῆς, καὶ εἰς αὐ- 30
τὴν ἡ ἀποστροφὴ αὐτῶν.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΖʹ. XVII.

ΚΥΡΙΟΣ ἔκτισεν ἐκ γῆς ἄνθρωπον, καὶ πάλιν ἀπέστρεψεν 1
αὐτὸν εἰς αὐτήν· ἡμέρας ἀριθμοῦ καὶ καιρὸν ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς, καὶ 2
ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς ἐξουσίαν τῶν ἐπ᾽ αὐτῆς. Καθ᾽ ἑαυτὸν ἐνέδυσεν 3
αὐτοὺς ἰσχύν, καὶ κατ᾽ εἰκόνα ἑαυτοῦ ἐποίησεν αὐτούς· ἔθηκε τὸν 4
φόβον αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ πάσης σαρκός, καὶ κατακυριεύειν θηρίων καὶ
πετεινῶν ἐν ὁμοιώματι. Ἔλαβον χρῆσιν τῶν πέντε τοῦ Κυρίου 5
ἐνεργημάτων· ἕκτον δὲ νοῦν αὐτοῖς ἐδωρήσατο μερίζων, καὶ τὸν
ἕβδομον λόγον ἑρμηνέα τῶν ἐνεργημάτων αὐτοῦ· διαβούλιον καὶ 6
γλῶσσαν καὶ ὀφθαλμούς, ὦτα καὶ καρδίαν ἔδωκε διανοεῖσθαι
αὐτοῖς· ἐπιστήμην συνέσεως ἐνέπλησεν αὐτούς, καὶ ἀγαθὰ καὶ κακὰ 7
ὑπέδειξεν αὐτοῖς. Καὶ ἔθηκε τὸν ὀφθαλμὸν αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὰς καρ- 8
δίας αὐτῶν, δεῖξαι αὐτοῖς τὸ μεγαλεῖον τῶν ἔργων αὐτοῦ· ἔχω- 9
μεν δι᾽ αἰῶνος καυχᾶσθαι ἐπὶ τοῖς θαυμασίοις αὐτοῦ, ἵνα διη-
γῶνται τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ συνετοί. Καὶ ὄνομα ἁγιασμοῦ αἰνέσουσιν 10
ἐκλεκτοί, ἵνα διηγῶνται τὰ μεγαλεῖα τῶν ἔργων αὐτοῦ. Προσέ- 11
θηκεν αὐτοῖς ἐπιστήμην, καὶ νόμον ζωῆς ἐκληροδότησεν αὐτοῖς·
διαθήκην αἰώνιον ἔστησε μετ᾽ αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰ κρίματα αὐτοῦ ὑπέ- 12
δειξεν αὐτοῖς· μεγαλεῖον δόξης ἴδοντο οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτῶν, καὶ δόξαν 13
φωνῆς αὐτῶν ἤκουσε τὸ οὖς αὐτῶν· καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· προσέχετε 14
ἀπὸ παντὸς ἀδίκου, καὶ ἐνετείλατο αὐτοῖς ἑκάστῳ περὶ τοῦ πλη-
σίον. Αἱ ὁδοὶ αὐτῶν ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ διαπαντός, οὐ κρυβήσονται 15
ἀπὸ τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν αὐτοῦ. Πᾶς δὲ ἄνθρωπος ἐκ νεότητος ἐπὶ τὰ 16
πονηρά, καὶ οὐκ ἴσχυσαν τὰς καρδίας αὐτῶν ἀντὶ λιθίνων ποιῆσαι
σαρκίνας. Ἐν γὰρ μερισμῷ τῶν ἐθνῶν τῆς γῆς πάσης, ἑκάστῳ 17

**Chapter Sixteen**

...[His] knowledge. In the judgment of the Lord are His works from the beginning,
and from their creation did He distinguish their portions. He adorned
His works unto the age, and their beginnings unto their generations;
neither did they toil, nor did they labor, and they ceased not from their
works. Each man did not oppress his neighbor; and until
the age shall they not be disobedient to His word. And after these things, the Lord
looked upon the earth, and filled it with His good things.
The soul of every living thing covered its face, and unto
it is their turning back.

**Chapter Seventeen**

THE LORD created man out of earth, and again did He turn
him unto it. Days of number and a time did He give unto them, and
He gave them authority over the things upon it. He clothed them with strength
of His own, and according to His own image did He make them. He put His
fear upon all flesh, and [gave them power] to have dominion over beasts and
fowls in like manner. They received the use of the five works of the Lord;
and the sixth, mind, He bestowed upon them, distributing [it]; and the
seventh, speech, the interpreter of His works. Counsel and
tongue and eyes, ears and heart did He give them, to understand;
He filled them with the knowledge of understanding, and good and evil
did He show unto them. And He set His eye upon their hearts,
to show them the greatness of His works. Let us
boast for all time in His marvels, that the wise may declare
His works. And the elect shall praise the name of holiness,
that they may declare the great things of His works. He further gave
them knowledge, and the law of life did He bequeath unto them.
An everlasting covenant did He establish with them, and His judgments did He
show unto them. The greatness of glory did their eyes behold, and the glory
of their voice did their ear hear. And He said unto them: “Beware
of every unrighteous thing,” and He commanded each of them concerning his neighbor.
Their ways are before Him at all times; they shall not be hidden
from His eyes. But every man from his youth [is inclined] unto evil things, and
they could not make their hearts of flesh instead of stone.
For in the division of all the nations of the earth, He set over each
