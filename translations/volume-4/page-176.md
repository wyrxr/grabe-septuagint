τοῖς συμβεβηκόσι χαρησομένους, συνέβη μᾶλλον αὐτὸν προθυμη-
θῆναι, ὡς τάχιστα πρὸς αὐτοὺς παραγενέσθαι. Διακομισθεὶς δὲ 9
εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα, καὶ θύσας τῷ μεγίστῳ Θεῷ, καὶ χάριτας ἀπο-
διδούς, καὶ τῶν ἑξῆς τι τῷ τόπῳ ποιήσας, καὶ δὴ παραγενό-
μενος εἰς τὸν τόπον, καὶ τῇ σπουδαιότητι καὶ εὐπρεπείᾳ κατα-
πλαγείς, θαυμάσας δὲ καὶ τὴν τοῦ ἱεροῦ εὐταξίαν, ἐνεθυμήθη 10
βουλεύσασθαι εἰς τὸν ναὸν εἰσελθεῖν. Τῶν δὲ εἰπόντων μὴ κα- 11
θήκειν γίνεσθαι τοῦτο, διὰ τὸ μηδὲ τοῖς ἐκ τοῦ ἔθνους ἐξεῖναι
εἰσιέναι, μηδὲ πᾶσι τοῖς ἱερεῦσιν, ἀλλ᾽ εἰ μόνῳ τῷ προηγουμένῳ
πάντων ἀρχιερεῖ, καὶ τούτῳ κατ᾽ ἐνιαυτὸν ἅπαξ, ὁ δὲ οὐδαμῶς
ἐπείθετο. Τοῦ τε νόμου παραγνωσθέντος, οὐδαμῶς ἀπέλιπε 12
προφερόμενος ἑαυτὸν δεῖν εἰσελθεῖν, λέγων, καὶ εἰ ἐκεῖνοι ἐστέ-
ρηνται ταύτης τῆς τιμῆς, ἐμὲ δὲ οὐ δεῖ. Καὶ ἐπυνθάνετο, διὰ 13
τίνα αἰτίαν αὐτὸν εἰσερχόμενον εἰς πᾶν τε τέμενος οὐδεὶς ἐκώ-
λυσε τῶν παρόντων ; Καί τις ἀπρονοήτως ἔφη κακῶς αὐτὸ 14
τοῦτο τερατεύεσθαι ; Γενομένου δὲ, φησί, τούτου διά τινα αἰ- 15
τίαν, οὐχὶ πάντες εἰσελεύσεσθαι, καὶ θελόντων αὐτῶν, καὶ μή;
Τῶν δὲ ἱερέων ἐν πάσαις ταῖς ἁγίαις ἐσθήσεσι προσπεσόντων, 16
καὶ δεομένων τοῦ μεγίστου Θεοῦ βοηθεῖν τῇ ἐνεστώσῃ ἀνάγκῃ,
καὶ τὴν ὁρμὴν τοῦ κακῶς ἐπιβαλλομένου μεταθεῖναι, κραυγῆς τε
μετὰ δακρύων τὸ ἱερὸν ἐμπλησάντων, οἱ κατὰ τὴν πόλιν ἀπο- 17
λειπόμενοι, ταραχθέντες ἐξεπήδησαν, ἄδηλον τιθέμενοι τὸ γενό-
μενον. Αἵ τε κατάκλειστοι παρθένοι ἐν θαλάμοις σὺν ταῖς τε- 18
κούσαις ἐξώρμησαν· καὶ σποδῷ καὶ κόνει τὰς κόμας πασάμεναι,
γόων τε καὶ στεναγμῶν ἐνεμπίπλων τὰς πλατείας. Αἱ δὲ καὶ 19
προσαρτίως ἐσταλμέναι, τοὺς πρὸς ἀπάντησιν διατεταγμένους πα-
στοὺς, καὶ τὴν ἁρμόζουσαν αἰδῶ παραλείπουσαι, δρόμον ἄτακτον
ἐν τῇ πόλει συνίσταντο. Τὰ δὲ νεογνὰ τῶν τέκνων, αἵ τε πρὸς 20
τούτοις μητέρες, καὶ τιθηνοὶ παραλείπουσαι ἄλλως καὶ ἄλλως,
αἱ μὲν κατ᾽ οἴκους, αἱ δὲ κατὰ τὰς ἁγίας ἀνεπιστρέπτως εἰς
τὸ πανυπέρτατον ἱερὸν ἠθροίζοντο. Ποικίλη δὲ ἦν τῶν εἰς τοῦτο 21
συλλεγέντων δέησις ἐπὶ τοῖς ἀνοσίως ὑπ᾽ ἐκείνου κατεγχειρουμέ-
νοις. Σύν τε τούτοις οἱ (περὶ) τῶν πολιτῶν θρασυνθέντες οὐκ ἠνεί- 22
χοντο τέλεον αὐτοῦ ἐπικειμένου, καὶ τὸ τῆς προθέσεως αὐτοῦ
ἐκπληροῦν διανοουμένου. Φωνήσαντες δὲ τὴν ὁρμὴν ἐπὶ τὰ ὅπλα 23
ποιήσασθαι, καὶ θαρραλέως ὑπὲρ τοῦ πατρῴου νόμου τελευτᾶν,

**Chapter 1**

**8** and to rejoice at these happenings, it came to pass that he was the more eager to come unto them with utmost speed.

**9** And having been conveyed unto Jerusalem, and having sacrificed unto the greatest God, and rendered thanks, and having done somewhat else for the place, and having indeed come unto the place, and being astounded by its zeal and comeliness,

**10** and having marvelled also at the good order of the temple, he purposed in his mind to enter into the sanctuary.

**11** But when they said that it was not fitting for this to be done, because it was not lawful even for those of the nation to enter, nor for all the priests, but only for the High Priest, who stood foremost of all, and to him but once in the year, he would in no wise be persuaded.

**12** And though the Law was made known unto him, he did in no wise cease, asserting that he ought to enter, saying, "And if they be deprived of this honour, yet ought not I [be deprived]."

**13** And he inquired, "For what reason, when I entered every temple, did none of those present hinder me?"

**14** And one imprudently said, "Is this very thing to be accounted an ill-omened wonder?"

**15** "For if this indeed cometh to pass," said he, "for some reason, shall not all then enter, whether they will or no?"

**16** But when the priests, clothed in all their holy vestments, had fallen prostrate and besought the greatest God to help them in the present distress, and to turn aside the furious onset of him who wickedly pressed on, and had filled the temple with cries and with tears,

**17** those remaining within the city, being troubled, rushed forth, perceiving not what had transpired.

**18** And the virgins shut up in their chambers, together with their mothers, did rush forth; and having sprinkled their hair with ashes and with dust, they filled the streets with wailing and with lamentations.

**19** And those also who had but recently been prepared [for marriage], leaving aside the bridal chambers that were arranged for their encounter, and forsaking their fitting modesty, did engage in a disorderly rush throughout the city.

**20** And the newborn children, and moreover their mothers and nurses, leaving [their places] in diverse ways, some from their homes and some from the sacred places, did gather without turning back unto the most High Sanctuary.

**21** And varied was the supplication of those gathered for this purpose, regarding the impious deeds undertaken by him.

**22** And with these, those among the citizens, emboldened, endured not that he should press on to the very end, and that he should purpose to fulfill his intent.

**23** And having cried out to make their rush unto arms, and to die courageously for the ancestral law, they caused a great tumult in that place; yet were they hardly turned back by the elders and the old men, and they settled into the same posture of supplication.

**24** And the multitude, as before, did busy themselves in these things, making supplication.

**25** But the elders about the king did in many ways endeavour to divert his arrogant mind from his conceived purpose.

**26** But he, becoming yet more emboldened, and having dismissed all [of them], did now make his approach, thinking to put an end to that which was before determined.

**27** Therefore, even those who were with him, seeing these things, turned to call upon Him who hath all might, together with our people, to aid those present, not overlooking the lawless and arrogant deed.

**28** And from the very dense and piercing cry that was gathered from the throngs, there was an inexpressible roar.

**29** For it seemed that not only the men, but also the walls and all the ground did resound, as indeed all were at that time preferring death before the defilement of the place.
