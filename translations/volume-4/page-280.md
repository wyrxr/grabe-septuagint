κρῖμα· καὶ ἔστι δικαιῶν κρίσει σοφός. Ἔστι πονηρευόμενος συγκεκο- 26
φὼς μελανίᾳ, καὶ τὰ ἐντὸς αὐτοῦ πλήρης δόλου· συγχύρων πρόσωπον 27
καὶ ἐθελοκωφῶν, ὅπου οὐκ ἐπεγνώσθη, προβιάσει σε· καὶ 28
ἐὰν ὑπὸ ἐλαττώματος ἰσχύος κωλυθῇ ἁμαρτεῖν, ἐὰν εὕρῃ καιρόν,
κακοποιήσει σε. Ἀπὸ δράσεως ἐπιγνωσθήσεται ἀνήρ, καὶ ἀπὸ ἀπαντήσεως 29
προσώπου ἐπιγνωσθήσεται νοήμων, στολισμὸς ἀνδρὸς 30
καὶ γέλως ὀδόντων καὶ βήματα ἀνθρώπου ἀναγγέλλει τὰ περὶ
αὐτοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. Κʹ. ΧΧ.

ἜΣΤΙΝ ἔλεγχος ὃς οὐκ ἔστιν ὡραῖος· καὶ ἔστι σιωπῶν, καὶ 1
αὐτὸς φρόνιμος. Ὡς καλὸν ἐλέγξαι ἢ θυμοῦσθαι κρυπτῶς· καὶ ὁ 2
ἀνθομολογούμενος ἀπὸ ἐλαττώσεως κωλυθήσεται. Ὡς καλὸν ἐλεγχθέντα 3
φανερῶσαι μετάνοιαν· οὕτως γὰρ φεύξει ἑκούσιον ἁμάρτημα.
Ἐπιθυμία εὐνούχου ἀποπαρθενῶσαι νεάνιδα· οὕτως ὁ ποιῶν 4
ἐν βίᾳ χρήματα. Ἔστι σιωπῶν εὑρισκόμενος σοφός, καὶ ἔστι μιση- 5
τὸς ἀπὸ πολλῆς λαλιᾶς. Ἔστι σιωπῶν, οὐ γὰρ ἔχει ἀπόκρισιν· 6
καὶ ἔστι σιωπῶν, εἰδὼς καιρόν. Ἄνθρωπος σοφὸς σιγήσει ἕως καιροῦ· 7
ὁ δὲ λαπιστὴς καὶ ἄφρων ὑπερβήσεται καιρόν. Ὁ πλεονάζων 8
λόγῳ βδελυχθήσεται, καὶ ὁ ἐξουσιαζόμενος μισηθήσεται. Ἔστιν εὐοδία 9
ἐν κακοῖς ἀνδρί, καὶ ἔστιν εὕρεμα εἰς ἐλάττωσιν. Ἔστι δόσις ἡ οὐ λυ- 10
σιτελήσει σοι, καὶ ἔστι δόσις ἧς τὸ ἀνταπόδομα διπλοῦν. Ἔστιν ἐλάττων 11
ἕνεκεν δόξης, καὶ ἔστιν ὃς ἀπὸ ταπεινώσεως ἦρε κεφαλήν. Ἔστιν 12
ὁ ἀγοράζων πολλὰ ὀλίγου, καὶ ἀποτίννων αὐτὰ ἑπταπλάσιον. Ὁ 13
σοφὸς ἐν λόγοις ἑαυτὸν προσφιλῆ ποιήσει· χάριτες δὲ μωρῶν ἐκχυθήσονται.
Δόσις ἄφρονος οὐ λυσιτελήσει σοι λαβόντι, ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ βασκάνου 14
δι’ ἀνάγκην αὐτοῦ· οἱ γὰρ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτοῦ ἀνθ’ ἑνὸς εἰς τὸ
λαβεῖν πολλοί· ὀλίγα δώσει καὶ πολλὰ ὀνειδίσει, καὶ ἀνοίξει τὸ 15
στόμα αὐτοῦ ὡς κῆρυξ· σήμερον δανείσει, καὶ αὔριον ἀπαιτήσει·
μισητὸς ἄνθρωπος ὁ τοιοῦτος Κυρίῳ καὶ ἀνθρώποις. Μωρὸς ἐρεῖ· 16
οὐχ ὑπάρχει μοι φίλος, καὶ οὐκ ἔστι χάρις τοῖς ἀγαθοῖς μου· οἱ
ἔσθοντες τὸν ἄρτον μου, φαῦλοι γλώσσῃ. Ποσάκις καὶ ὅσοι καταγελάσονται 17
αὐτοῦ; οὔτε γὰρ τὸ ἔχειν ἐν ὀρθῇ αἰσθήσει εἴληφε,
καὶ τὸ μὴ ἔχειν ὁμοίως ἀδιάφορον αὐτῷ. Ὀλίσθημα ἀπὸ ἐδάφους 18
μᾶλλον ἢ ἀπὸ γλώσσης· οὕτως πτῶσις κακῶν κατὰ σπουδὴν ἥξει.

**Chapter Nineteen**

<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">judgement;</span> and there is one who by judgement is wise.
There is one who doth act wickedly, though beaten with blackness,
and his inward parts are full of deceit;
disguising his face and feigning deafness,
where he is not recognized, he shall do violence unto thee.
And if by reason of a diminution of strength
he be hindered from sinning,
if he find an opportune time, he shall do evil unto thee.
From his appearance shall a man be known,
and from the encounter with his countenance shall a man of understanding be recognized.
The attire of a man, and the laughter of teeth,
and the steps of a man, do declare the things concerning him.

**Chapter Twenty**

There is a reproof which is not timely;
and there is one who is silent, and he himself is prudent.
How good it is to reprove than to be angry secretly;
and he that confesseth shall be hindered from [further] failing.
How good it is, when one is reproved, to show forth repentance;
for thus shall he flee from voluntary sin.
The desire of a eunuch is to deflower a virgin;
so also is he that maketh money by violence.
There is one who, by being silent, is found wise;
and there is one who is hated for much speaking.
There is one who is silent, for he hath no answer;
and there is one who is silent, knowing the opportune time.
A wise man will keep silence until the opportune time;
but the chatterer and the fool shall pass over the opportune time.
He that aboundeth in words shall be abhorred,
and he that usurpeth authority shall be hated.
There is prosperity for a man in evils,
and there is a finding that leadeth to loss.
There is a gift which shall not profit thee,
and there is a gift of which the recompense is double.
There is one who is lessened for the sake of glory,
and there is one who, from humility, hath lifted up his head.
There is one who buyeth many things for a small price,
and repayeth them sevenfold.
The wise man in words shall make himself beloved;
but the graces of fools shall be poured out [in vain].
The gift of a fool shall not profit thee who receivest it,
and likewise also that of an envious man, through his own necessity;
for his eyes, instead of one, are many for receiving.
Few things shall he give, and many things shall he reproach;
and he shall open his mouth as a herald.
Today shall he lend, and tomorrow shall he demand repayment.
Such a man is hateful to the Lord and to men.
A fool shall say, "There is no friend for me,
and there is no favor for my good deeds;
they that eat my bread are wicked in tongue."
How oft and by how many shall he be derided?
For neither hath he received the having of possessions with right judgment,
and the not having them is likewise indifferent to him.
A fall from the ground is better than a slip from the tongue;
thus shall the downfall of the wicked come swiftly.
