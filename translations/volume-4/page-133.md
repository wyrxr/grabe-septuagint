**ΚΕΦ. ΙΣ΄.**

**7** αὐτῶν αὐτὸς καὶ ὁ λαὸς αὐτοῦ· καὶ εἶδε τὸν λαὸν δειλούμενον διαπεράσαι τὸν χειμάῤῥουν, καὶ διεπέρασε πρῶτος, καὶ εἶδον αὐτόν οἱ ἄνδρες, καὶ διεπέρασαν κατόπισθεν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ διέπελε τὸν λαὸν καὶ τοὺς ἱππεῖς ἐν μέσῳ τῶν πεζῶν· ἡ δὲ ἵππος τῶν ὑπεναντίων πολλὴ σφόδρα.
**8** Καὶ ἐσάλπισαν ταῖς ἱεραῖς σάλπιξι, καὶ ἐτροπώθη Κενδεβαῖος καὶ ἡ παρεμβολὴ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔπεσον ἐξ αὐτῶν τραυματίαι πολλοί· οἱ δὲ καταλειφθέντες ἔφυγον εἰς τὸ ὀχύρωμα.
**9** Τότε ἐτραυματίσθη Ἰούδας ὁ ἀδελφὸς Ἰωάννου· Ἰωάννης δὲ κατεδίωξεν αὐτοὺς ἕως ἐλθεῖν εἰς Κεδρών, ἣν ᾠκοδόμησε.
**10** Καὶ ἔφυγον ἕως εἰς τοὺς πύργους τοὺς ἐν τῷ ἀγρῷ Ἀζώτου, καὶ ἐνεπύρισεν αὐτὴν ἐν πυρί, καὶ ἔπεσαν ἐξ αὐτῶν εἰς ἄνδρας δισχιλίους, καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν εἰς τὴν Ἰουδαίαν μετ᾽ εἰρήνης.
**11** Καὶ Πτολεμαῖος ὁ τοῦ Ἀβούβου ἦν καθεσταμένος στρατηγὸς εἰς τὸ πεδίον Ἰεριχώ, καὶ ἔσχεν ἀργύριον καὶ χρυσίον πολύ.
**12** Ἦν γὰρ γαμβρὸς τοῦ ἀρχιερέως.
**13** Καὶ ὑψώθη ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἠβουλήθη κατακρατῆσαι τῆς χώρας, καὶ ἐβουλεύετο δόλῳ κατὰ Σίμωνος καὶ κατὰ τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ ἅμα αὐτούς.
**14** Σίμων δὲ ἦν ἐροδεύων τὰς πόλεις τὰς ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ καὶ φροντίζων τῆς ἐπιμελείας αὐτῶν, καὶ κατέβη εἰς Ἰεριχώ αὐτὸς καὶ Ματταθίας καὶ Ἰούδας καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ ἔτους ἑβδόμου καὶ ἑβδομηκοστοῦ καὶ ἑκατοστοῦ ἐν μηνὶ ἑνδεκάτῳ, οὗτος ὁ μὴν Σαβάτ.
**15** Καὶ ὑπεδέξατο αὐτοὺς ὁ τοῦ Ἀβούβου εἰς τὸ ὀχυρωμάτιον τὸ καλούμενον Δὼκ κατὰ δόλου ὃ ᾠκοδόμησε, καὶ ἐποίησεν αὐτοῖς πότον μέγαν, καὶ ἐνέκρυψεν ἐκεῖ ἄνδρας.
**16** Καὶ ὅτι ἐμεθύσθη Σίμων καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ, ἐξανέστη Πτολεμαῖος καὶ οἱ μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐλάβοσαν τὰ ὅπλα αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπεισήλθοσαν τῷ Σίμωνι εἰς τὸ συμπόσιον, καὶ ἀπέκτειναν αὐτὸν καὶ τοὺς δύο υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ, καὶ τινας τῶν παιδαρίων αὐτοῦ.
**17** Καὶ ἐποίησεν ἀθεσίαν μεγάλην, καὶ ἀνταπέδωκε κακὰ ἀντὶ ἀγαθῶν.
**18** Καὶ ἔγραψε ταῦτα Πτολεμαῖος, καὶ ἀπέστειλε τῷ βασιλεῖ, ὅπως ἀποστείλῃ αὐτῷ δυνάμεις εἰς βοήθειαν, καὶ παραδῷ αὐτῷ τὴν χώραν αὐτῶν καὶ τὰς πόλεις.
**19** Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ἑτέρους εἰς Γάζαρα ἆραι τὸν Ἰωάννην, καὶ τοῖς χιλιάρχοις ἀπέστειλεν ἐπιστολὰς παραγενέσθαι πρὸς αὐτόν, ὅπως δῷ αὐτοῖς ἀργύριον καὶ χρυσίον καὶ δόματα.
**20** Καὶ ἑτέρους ἀπέστειλε καταλαβέσθαι τὴν Ἱερουσαλήμ καὶ τὸ ὄρος τοῦ ἱεροῦ.
**21** Καὶ προδραμών τις ἀπήγγειλεν Ἰωάννῃ

**Chapter 16**

**7** ...[And he encamped against] them, even he and his people. And when he beheld the people fearful to pass over the torrent, he himself passed over first; and when the men saw him, they passed over after him. And he put to flight the people and the horsemen in the midst of the footmen; but the cavalry of the adversaries was exceeding mighty.

**8** And they blew with the sacred trumpets, and Cendebaeus and his camp were routed; and many wounded fell from among them. And they that were left fled unto the stronghold.

**9** Then was Judas, the brother of John, wounded; but John pursued them until they came unto Cedron, which [Cendebaeus] had built.

**10** And they fled even unto the towers in the plain of Azotus, and [John] set it on fire with fire; and there fell from among them about two thousand men, and he returned unto Judea with peace.

**11** Now Ptolemy, the son of Abub, was appointed captain over the plain of Jericho, and he had much silver and gold.

**12** For he was the son-in-law of the high priest.

**13** And his heart was lifted up, and he sought to seize the land; and he devised a plot by guile against Simon and against his sons, to destroy them together.

**14** And Simon was journeying through the cities which were in the land, and overseeing their care; and he went down unto Jericho, he and Mattathias and Judas, his sons, in the hundred seventy-seventh year, in the eleventh month, which month is Shebat.

**15** And the son of Abub received them into the small fortress which is called Dok, by deceit, [the very place] which he himself had built; and he made for them a great feast, and hid men therein.

**16** And when Simon and his sons were drunken, Ptolemy and those with him rose up, and took their weapons; and they came in upon Simon at the banquet, and slew him and his two sons, and certain of his servants.

**17** And he committed a great transgression, and rendered evil in return for good.

**18** And Ptolemy wrote these things, and sent [them] unto the king, that he might send him forces for help, and deliver unto him their land and their cities.

**19** And he sent others unto Gazara to seize John; and unto the captains of thousands he sent letters, bidding them come unto him, that he might give them silver and gold and gifts.

**20** And he sent others to take possession of Jerusalem and the mount of the Temple.

**21** And one, having run ahead, reported unto John
