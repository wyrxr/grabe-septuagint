ΚΕΦ. Ι. ΜΑΚΚΑΒΑΙΩΝ Αʹ. 1643
τῆς χώρας Σαμαρείας προστεθεῖσα τῇ Ἰουδαίᾳ πρὸς τὸ λογισθῆναι τοῦ γενέσθαι ὑφ’ ἕνα, τοῦ μὴ ὑπακοῦσαι ἄλλης ἐξουσίας ἀλλ’ ἢ τοῦ ἀρχιερέως. Πτολεμαΐδα καὶ τὴν προσκυροῦσαν αὐτῇ 39
δίδωκα δῶμα τοῖς ἁγίοις τοῖς ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ εἰς τὴν προκαθήκουσαν δαπάνην τοῖς ἁγίοις. Κἀγὼ δίδωμι κατ’ ἐνιαυτὸν δεκαπέντε 40
χιλιάδας σίκλων ἀργυρίου ἀπὸ τῶν λόγων τοῦ βασιλέως ἀπὸ τῶν τόπων τῶν ἀνηκόντων. Καὶ πᾶν τὸ πλεονάζον, 41
ὃ οὐκ ἀπεδίδωσαν οἱ ἀπὸ τῶν χρεῖῶν, ὡς ἐν τοῖς πρώτοις ἔτεσιν, ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν δώσουσιν εἰς τὰ ἔργα τοῦ οἴκου. Καὶ ἐπὶ τούτοις 42
πεντακισχιλίους σίκλους ἀργυρίου, οὓς ἐλάμβανον ἀπὸ τῶν χρεῖῶν, ὡς ἐν τοῖς πρώτοις ἔτεσι τοῦ ἁγίου ἀπὸ τοῦ λόγου κατ’ ἐνιαυτόν, καὶ ταῦτα ἀφίεται, διὰ τὸ ἀνήκειν αὐτὰ τοῖς ἱερεῦσι τοῖς λειτουργοῦσι. Καὶ ὅσοι ἐὰν φύγωσιν εἰς τὸ ἱερὸν τὸ ἐν Ἱεροσολύμοις 43
καὶ ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς ὁρίοις αὐτοῦ, ὀφείλοντες βασιλικὰ καὶ πᾶν πρᾶγμα, ἀπολελύσθωσαν, καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐστὶν αὐτοῖς ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ μου. Καὶ τοῦ οἰκοδομηθῆναι καὶ τοῦ ἐπικαινισθῆναι τὰ 44
ἔργα τῶν ἁγίων, καὶ ἡ δαπάνη δοθήσεται ἐκ τοῦ λόγου τοῦ βασιλέως. Καὶ τοῦ οἰκοδομῆσαι τὰ τείχη Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ὀχυρῶσαι 45
κυκλόθεν, καὶ ἡ δαπάνη δοθήσεται ἐκ τοῦ λόγου τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ τοῦ οἰκοδομῆσαι τὰ τείχη τὰ ἐν τῇ Ἰουδαίᾳ. Ὡς δὲ ἤκουσεν 46
Ἰωνάθαν καὶ ὁ λαὸς τοὺς λόγους τούτους, οὐκ ἐπίστευσαν αὐτοῖς, οὐδὲ ἐπεδέξαντο, ὅτι ἐμεμνήσθησαν τῆς κακίας τῆς μεγάλης, ἧς ἐποίησεν ἐν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἔθλιψεν αὐτοὺς σφόδρα. Καὶ 47
εὐδόκησαν ἐν Ἀλεξάνδρῳ, ὅτι αὐτὸς ἐγένετο αὐτοῖς ἀρχηγὸς λόγων εἰρηνικῶν, καὶ συνεμάχουν αὐτῷ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας. Καὶ 48
συνήγαγεν Ἀλέξανδρος ὁ βασιλεὺς δυνάμεις μεγάλας, καὶ παρενέβαλεν ἐξεναντίας Δημητρίου. Καὶ συνῆψαν πόλεμον οἱ δύο βα- 49
σιλεῖς, καὶ ἔφυγεν ἡ παρεμβολὴ Δημητρίου, καὶ ἐδίωξεν αὐτὸν ὁ Ἀλέξανδρος, καὶ ἴσχυσεν ἐπ’ αὐτοῖς. Καὶ ἐπερέωσε πόλεμον 50
σφόδρα ἕως ἕω ὁ ἥλιος, καὶ ἔπεσεν ὁ Δημήτριος ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ. Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ἀλέξανδρος πρὸς Πτολεμαῖον βασιλέα 51
Αἰγύπτου πρέσβεις κατὰ τοὺς λόγους τούτους, λέγων· Ἐπεὶ ἀνέστρεψα εἰς γῆν βασιλείας μου, καὶ ἐκάθισα ἐπὶ θρόνου 52
πατέρων μου, καὶ ἐκράτησα τῆς ἀρχῆς, καὶ συνέτριψα τὸν Δημήτριον· καὶ ἐπεκράτησα τῆς χώρας ἡμῶν. Καὶ συνῆψα πρὸς 53
αὐτὸν μάχην, καὶ συνετρίβη αὐτός, καὶ ἡ παρεμβολὴ αὐτοῦ ὑφ’
