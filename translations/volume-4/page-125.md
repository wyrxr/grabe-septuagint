**ΚΕΦ. ΙΓʹ.**

...ἐποίησε πληγὴν μεγάλην ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς.
**33** Καὶ ᾠκοδόμησε Σίμων τὰ ὀχυρώματα τῆς Ἰουδαίας, καὶ περιετείχισε πύργοις ὑψηλοῖς καὶ τείχεσι μεγάλοις (καὶ πύργοις) καὶ πύλαις καὶ μοχλοῖς, καὶ ἔθετο βρώματα τοῖς ὀχυρώμασι.
**34** Καὶ ἐπελέξατο Σίμων ἄνδρας, καὶ ἀπέστειλε πρὸς Δημήτριον τὸν βασιλέα τοῦ ποιῆσαι ἄφεσιν τῇ χώρᾳ, ὅτι πᾶσαι αἱ πράξεις Τρύφωνος ἦσαν ἀρπαγαί.
**35** Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν αὐτῷ Δημήτριος ὁ βασιλεὺς κατὰ τοὺς λόγους τούτους· καὶ ἀπεκρίθη αὐτῷ, καὶ ἔγραψεν αὐτῷ ἐπιστολὴν τοιαύτην.
**36** Βασιλεὺς Δημήτριος Σίμωνι ἀρχιερεῖ καὶ φίλῳ βασιλέων
**37** καὶ πρεσβυτέροις καὶ ἔθνει Ἰουδαίων χαίρειν. Τὸν στέφανον τὸν χρυσοῦν, καὶ τὴν βαΐνην, ἣν ἀπεστείλατε, κεκομίσμεθα, καὶ ἕτοιμοί ἐσμεν τοῦ ποιεῖν ὑμῖν εἰρήνην μεγάλην, καὶ γράφειν τοῖς
**38** ἐπὶ τῶν χρειῶν τοῦ ἀφεῖναι ὑμῖν ἀφέματα. Καὶ ὅσα ἐστήσαμεν πρὸς ὑμᾶς ἔστηκε, καὶ τὰ ὀχυρώματα, ἃ ᾠκοδομήσατε, ὑπαρχέτω ὑμῖν.
**39** Ἀφίεμεν δὲ ὑμῖν ἀγνόηματα καὶ τὰ ἁμαρτήματα, ἕως τῆς σήμερον ἡμέρας, καὶ τὸν στέφανον, ὃν ὠφείλετε, καὶ
**40** εἴ τι ἄλλο ἐτελωνεῖτο ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, μηκέτι τελωνείσθω. Καὶ εἴ τινες ἐπιτήδειοι ἡμῶν γραφῆναι εἰς τοὺς περὶ ἡμᾶς, ἐγγραφέσθωσαν,
**41** καὶ γινέσθω ἀναμέσον ἡμῶν εἰρήνη. Ἔτους ἑκατοστοῦ
**42** ἑβδομηκοστοῦ ἤρθη ὁ ζυγὸς τῶν ἐθνῶν ἀπὸ τοῦ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἤρξατο ὁ λαὸς Ἰσραὴλ γράφειν ἐν ταῖς συγγραφαῖς καὶ συναλλάγμασιν, Ἔτους πρώτου ἐπὶ Σίμωνος ἀρχιερέως μεγάλου καὶ
**43** στρατηγοῦ καὶ ἡγουμένου Ἰουδαίων. Ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις παρενέβαλε Σίμων ἐπὶ Γάζαν, καὶ ἐκύκλωσεν αὐτὴν παρεμβολαῖς, καὶ ἐποίησεν ἐλεπόλεις, καὶ προσήγαγε τῇ πόλει, καὶ ἐπάταξε
**44** πύργον ἕνα, καὶ κατελάβετο. Καὶ ἐξήλλοντο οἱ ἐν τῇ ἐλεπόλει
**45** εἰς τὴν πόλιν, καὶ ἐγένετο κίνημα μέγα ἐν τῇ πόλει. Καὶ ἀνέβησαν οἱ ἐν τῇ πόλει σὺν ταῖς γυναιξὶ καὶ τοῖς τέκνοις ἐπὶ τὸ τεῖχος διεῤῥηχότες τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐβόησαν φωνῇ μεγάλῃ
**46** ἀξιοῦντες Σίμωνα δεξιὰς αὐτοῖς δοῦναι. Καὶ εἶπαν· μὴ ἡμῖν
**47** χρήσῃ κατὰ τὰς πονηρίας ἡμῶν, ἀλλὰ κατὰ τὸ ἔλεός σου. Καὶ συνελύθη αὐτοῖς Σίμων, καὶ οὐκ ἐπολέμησεν αὐτοὺς· καὶ ἐξέβαλεν αὐτοὺς ἐκ τῆς πόλεως, καὶ ἐκαθάρισε τὰς οἰκίας, ἐν αἷς ἦν τὰ εἴδωλα, καὶ οὕτως εἰσῆλθεν εἰς αὐτὴν ὑμνῶν καὶ εὐλογῶν.
**48** Καὶ ἐξέβαλεν ἐξ αὐτῆς πᾶσαν ἀκαθαρσίαν, καὶ κατώκισεν ἐν αὐτῇ

**13:32** ...and wrought great destruction upon the land.
**13:33** And Simon built the fortresses of Judea, and walled them round about with high towers and great walls, (yea, with towers,) and with gates and bars; and he stored up provisions in the fortresses.
**13:34** Then Simon chose men, and sent them unto Demetrius the king, to treat of a release for the land; for all the deeds of Tryphon were acts of plunder.
**13:35** And King Demetrius sent unto him according to these words; and he answered him, and wrote unto him a letter after this manner:
**13:36** "King Demetrius unto Simon, the High Priest and friend of kings,
**13:37** and unto the elders, and the nation of the Jews, sendeth greeting. The golden crown, and the palm branch, which ye sent, we have received; and we are ready to make a great peace with you, and to write unto those
**13:38** who are over the affairs, to grant unto you remissions. And whatsoever things we have established with you shall stand; and the fortresses which ye have built shall be yours.
**13:39** Moreover, we remit unto you the errors and the sins, [even] until this present day, and the crown which ye owed, and
**13:40** if any other tribute was levied in Jerusalem, let it no longer be levied. And if there be any among you who are fit to be enrolled in our company, let them be enrolled,
**13:41** and let there be peace betwixt us." In the one hundred and seventieth year
**13:42** was the yoke of the Gentiles lifted from Israel. And the people of Israel began to write in their documents and contracts, "[In the] first year of Simon the great High Priest and
**13:43** commander and leader of the Jews." In those days, Simon encamped against Gaza, and encompassed it with his forces; and he made siege engines, and brought them nigh unto the city, and smote
**13:44** one tower, and took it. And they that were in the siege engine sprang forth
**13:45** into the city, and a great commotion arose within the city. Then they that were in the city, with their wives and children, went up upon the wall, having rent their garments, and cried with a loud voice,
**13:46** praying Simon to grant them peace. And they said, "Deal not with us
**13:47** according to our wickedness, but according to thy mercy." And Simon was reconciled with them, and did not make war against them; but he cast them out of the city, and cleansed the houses wherein were the idols. And so he entered into it with hymns and with blessings.
**13:48** And he cast out thence all uncleanness, and placed therein
