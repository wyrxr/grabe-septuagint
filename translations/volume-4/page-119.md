**ΜΑΚΚΑΒΑΙΩΝ Αʹ. ΚΕΦ. ΙΑʹ.**
τῷ ἐξουσίαν πίνειν ἐν χρυσώμασι, καὶ εἶναι ἐν πορφύρᾳ, καὶ
59 ἔχειν πόρπην χρυσῆν. Καὶ Σίμωνα τὸν ἀδελφὸ αὑτοῦ κατέστησε στρατηγὸν ἀπὸ τῆς κλίμακος Τύρου ἕως τῶν ὁρίων Αἰγύπτου.
60 Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Ἰωναθαν, καὶ διεπωρεύετο πέραν τοῦ ποταμοῦ καὶ ἐν ταῖς πόλεσι, καὶ ἠθροίσθησαν πρὸς αὐτὸν πᾶσαι αἱ δυνάμεις Συρίας εἰς συμμαχίαν, καὶ ἦλθεν εἰς Ἀσκάλωνα, καὶ
61 ἀπήντησαν αὐτῷ οἱ ἐκ τῆς πόλεως ἐνδόξως. Καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ἐκεῖθεν εἰς Γάζαν καὶ ἀπέκλεισαν οἱ ἀπὸ Γάζης, καὶ περιεκάθισε περὶ αὐτήν, καὶ ἐνεπύρισε τὰ περιπόλια αὐτῆς ἐν πυρί, καὶ ἐσκάλευεν αὐτά.
62 Καὶ ἠξίωσαν οἱ ἀπὸ Γάζης τὸν Ἰωναθαν, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς δεξιάς, καὶ ἔλαβε τοὺς υἱοὺς τῶν ἀρχόντων αὐτῶν εἰς ὅμηρα, καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν αὐτοὺς εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ διῆλθε τὴν χώραν ἕως Δαμασκοῦ.
63 Καὶ ἤκουσεν Ἰωναθαν ὅτι παρῆσαν οἱ ἄρχοντες Δημητρίου εἰς Κάδης τὴν ἐν τῇ Γαλιλαίᾳ μετὰ δυνάμεως πολλῆς, βουλόμενοι μεταστῆσαι αὐτὸν τῆς χρείας.
64 Καὶ συνήντησεν αὐτοῖς, τὸν δὲ ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ Σίμωνα κατέλιπεν ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ.
65 Καὶ παρενέβαλε Σίμων ἐπὶ Βαιθσούρα, καὶ ἐπολέμει αὐτὴν ἡμέρας πολλάς, καὶ συνέκλεισεν αὐτήν.
66 Καὶ ἠξίωσαν αὐτὸν τοῦ δεξιᾶς λαβεῖν, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἐξέβαλεν αὐτοὺς ἐκεῖθεν, καὶ κατελάβετο τὴν πόλιν, καὶ ἔθετο ἐπ᾿ αὐτὴν φρουράν.
67 Καὶ Ἰωναθαν καὶ ἡ παρεμβολὴ αὐτοῦ παρενέβαλον ἐπὶ τὸ ὕδωρ τοῦ Γεννησὰρ, καὶ ὠρθρισαν τὸ πρωΐ εἰς τὸ πεδίον Νασώρ.
68 Καὶ ἰδοὺ παρεμβολὴ ἀλλοφύλων ἀπήντα αὐτῷ ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ, καὶ ἐξέβαλεν ἔνεδρον ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν ἐν τοῖς ὄρεσιν, αὐτοὶ δὲ ἀπήντησαν ἐξεναντίας.
69 Τὰ δὲ ἔνεδρα ἐξανέστησαν ἐκ τῶν τόπων ἑαυτῶν, καὶ συνῆψαν πόλεμον καὶ ἔφυγον οἱ παρὰ Ἰωναθα πάντες.
70 Οὐδὲ εἷς κατελείφθη ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν, πλὴν Ματταθίας ὁ τοῦ Ἀβεσσαλώμου καὶ Ἰούδας ὁ τοῦ Χαλφεῖ ἄρχοντες τῆς στρατιᾶς τῶν δυνάμεων.
71 Καὶ διέρρηξεν Ἰωναθαν τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ, καὶ
72 ἐπέθετο γῆν ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ, καὶ προσηύξατο. Καὶ ἐπέστρεψε πρὸς αὐτοὺς πολέμῳ, καὶ ἐτροπώσατο αὐτούς, καὶ ἔφυγον.
73 Καὶ ἰδον οἱ φυγόντες οἱ παρ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν πρὸς αὐτὸν, καὶ ἐδίωκον μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἕως Κάδης ἕως τῆς παρεμβολῆς αὐτῶν, καὶ παρενέβαλον ἐκεῖ.
74 Καὶ ἔπεσιν ἐκ τῶν ἀλλοφύλων ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ εἰς ἄνδρας τρισχιλίους· καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν Ἰωναθαν εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ.

**11:61** those of the city came forth to meet him gloriously. And from thence he departed unto Gaza, but those of Gaza did shut their gates against him. And he did encamp round about it, and set the outskirts thereof on fire, and did utterly destroy them.
**11:62** And those of Gaza did entreat Jonathan, and he gave them pledges of peace. And he took the sons of their rulers for hostages, and sent them forth unto Jerusalem; and he passed through the country, even unto Damascus.
**11:63** And Jonathan heard that the commanders of Demetrius were come unto Kedesh, which is in Galilee, with a great host, purposing to remove him from his office.
**11:64** And he went forth to meet them; but Simon his brother he left in the land.
**11:65** And Simon encamped against Beth-zur, and did make war against it for many days, and did shut it up.

**11:71** And Jonathan tore his garments, and
**11:72** put earth upon his head, and made prayer. And he turned back unto them in battle, and put them to flight, and they did flee.
**11:73** And when they who had fled from him did see this, they returned unto him, and pursued with him as far as Kedesh, even unto their camp, and there they encamped.
**11:74** And there fell of the foreigners on that day about three thousand men. And Jonathan returned unto Jerusalem.
