Ἀβραὰμ καὶ Ἰσαὰκ καὶ Ἰακὼβ ὑποδέξονται εἰς τοὺς κόλπους αὐ-

ἀδελφούς. Οὐκ ἀγνοεῖτε δὲ τὰ τῆς ἀδελφότητος φίλτρα, ἅπερ ἡ 19

**CHAPTER XIII.**

Let us therefore arm ourselves with the mastery of divine reason over the passions.
**17** For in this wise, Abraham and Isaac and Jacob shall receive us, having suffered thus, into their bosoms; and all the fathers shall commend [us].
**18** And unto each one of his brethren who had died before him, the remaining ones did say, "Shame us not, O brother, nor belie our brethren who died before us."
**19** And ye are not ignorant of the bonds of brotherhood, which divine and all-wise Providence did distribute unto them that are born through the fathers, and did implant by the maternal womb;
**20** wherein brethren, having sojourned for the same season, and formed in the selfsame time, and nurtured of the same blood, and brought to full term by the same soul, and delivered after equal periods of time;
**21** and drinking milk from the selfsame fountains, whence souls devoted to brethren are nourished in the embraces of the breasts;
**22** and waxing stronger through their common nurture, and their daily converse, and their other instruction, and our own exercise in the Law of God.
**23** Thus then, their sympathetic brotherly love being established, the seven brethren did hold a more tender concord one with another.
**24** For having been trained by the selfsame Law, and having exercised the same virtues, and having been brought up in a righteous life, they did love one another the more.
**25** For the emulation of goodness and nobility did intensify their concord one with another.
**26** For with their piety, they did render their brotherly love yet more desirable unto themselves.
**27** But notwithstanding, though the bonds of brotherhood — [manifest] both in nature and in custom, and in the ways of virtue — did greatly increase among them, yet did they endure, for piety's sake, [the sight of] their brethren, though they were left behind among those being tormented, seeing them tortured even unto death.

**CHAPTER XIV.**

**1** Moreover, they did also exhort [one another] unto the torment, so as not only to scorn the pains, but also to prevail over the affections of their brethren's brotherly love.
**2** O reasonings more regal than a king, and more free than freemen!
**3** O sacred and harmonious concord concerning the piety of the seven brethren!
**4** None among the seven youths did quail, nor did he shrink from death.
**5** But all, as if running upon the path to immortality, did hasten unto death through the torments.
**6** Just as
