**18** εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ βασιλέως Ναβουχοδονόσορ, ὅτι ἰδοὺ Ὁλοφέρνης
χάμαι, καὶ ἡ κεφαλὴ οὐκ ἔστιν ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ. **19** Ὡς δὲ ἤκουσαν ταῦτα
τὰ ῥήματα οἱ ἄρχοντες τῆς δυνάμεως Ἀσσούρ, διέρρηξαν τοὺς
χιτῶνας αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐταράχθη ἡ ψυχὴ αὐτῶν σφόδρα, καὶ ἐγέ-
νετο αὐτῶν κραυγὴ καὶ βοὴ μεγάλη σφόδρα ἐν μέσῳ τῆς πα-
ρεμβολῆς.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΕ´. XV.

**1** ΚΑΙ ὡς ἤκουσαν οἱ ἐν τοῖς σκηνώμασιν ὄντες, ἐξέστησαν
ἐπὶ τὸ γεγονός· **2** καὶ ἔπεσεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς φόβος καὶ τρόμος, καὶ
οὐκ ἦν ἄνθρωπος μένων κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ πλησίον ἔτι, ἀλλ᾿ ἐκ-
χυθέντες ὁμοθυμαδὸν ἔφευγον ἐπὶ πᾶσαν ὁδὸν τοῦ πεδίου καὶ τῆς
ὀρεινῆς. **3** Καὶ οἱ παρεμβεβληκότες ἐν τῇ ὀρεινῇ κύκλῳ Βετυλούα
ἐτράπησαν εἰς φυγὴν. καὶ τότε οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ πᾶς ἀνὴρ πολε-
μιστὴς ἐξ αὐτῶν ἐξεχύθησαν ἐπ᾿ αὐτούς. **4** Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ὀζίας
εἰς Βαιτομασθαίμ, καὶ Βηβαί, καὶ Χωβαί, καὶ Χωλά, καὶ
εἰς πᾶν ὅριον Ἰσραὴλ, τοὺς ἀπαγγέλλοντας ὑπὲρ τῶν συντετελε-
σμένων, καὶ ἵνα πάντες ἐπεκχυθῶσι τοῖς πολεμίοις εἰς τὴν ἀ-
ναίρεσιν αὐτῶν. **5** Ὡς δὴ ἤκουσαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ, πάντες ὁμοθυ-
μαδὸν ἐπέπεσον ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς, καὶ ἔκοπτον αὐτοὺς ἕως Χωβά. οὕ-
τως δὲ καὶ οἱ ἐξ Ἱερουσαλὴμ παρεγενήθησαν, καὶ ἐκ πάσης
τῆς ὀρεινῆς· ἀνήγγειλαν γὰρ αὐτοῖς τὰ γεγονότα τῇ παρεμβολῇ
τῶν ἐχθρῶν αὐτῶν. καὶ οἱ ἐν τῇ Γαλιλαίᾳ καὶ οἱ ἐν τῇ Γαλιλαίᾳ
ὑπερεκέρασαν αὐτοὺς πληγῇ μεγάλῃ, ἕως οὗ παρῆλθον Δαμασκὸν,
καὶ τὰ ὅρια αὐτῆς. **6** Οἱ δὲ λοιποὶ οἱ κατοικοῦντες Βετυλούα, ἐπέ-
πεσον τῇ παρεμβολῇ Ἀσσούρ, καὶ ἐπρονόμευσαν αὐτοὺς, καὶ ἐ-
πλούτησαν σφόδρα. **7** Οἱ δὲ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἀναστρέψαντες ἀπὸ τῆς
κοπῆς, ἐκυρίευσαν τῶν λοιπῶν, καὶ αἱ κῶμαι καὶ ἐπαύλεις ἐν
τῇ ὀρεινῇ καὶ πεδινῇ ἐκράτησαν πολλῶν λαφύρων· ἦν γὰρ πλῆθος
πολὺ σφόδρα. **8** Καὶ Ἰωακεὶμ ὁ ἱερεὺς ὁ μέγας καὶ ἡ γερουσία τῶν
υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ οἱ κατοικοῦντες ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἦλθον τοῦ θεάσα-
σθαι τὰ ἀγαθὰ ἃ ἐποίησε Κύριος τῷ Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ τοῦ ἰδεῖν τὴν
Ἰουδίθ, καὶ λαλῆσαι μετ᾿ αὐτῆς εἰρήνην. **9** Ὡς δὲ εἰσῆλθον πρὸς
αὐτὴν, εὐλόγησαν αὐτὴν πάντες ὁμοθυμαδὸν, καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς αὐ-
τὴν· σὺ ὕψωμα Ἰσραὴλ, σὺ γαυρίαμα μέγα τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ, σὺ
καύχημα μέγα τοῦ γένους ἡμῶν. **10** Ἐποίησας ταῦτα πάντα ἐν χειρί
σου, εὐποιήσας τὰ ἀγαθὰ μετὰ ᾿Ισραήλ· καὶ εὐδοκήσαι ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῖς
ὁ Θεός.

#### CHAPTER 14

**18** upon the house of King Nebuchadnezzar, for behold, Holofernes lieth upon the ground, and his head is not upon him.”
**19** And when the commanders of the Assyrian army heard these words, they rent their tunics, and their souls were exceedingly troubled, and there arose a very great cry and a shout from them in the midst of the camp.

#### CHAPTER 15

**1** And when they that were in the tents heard, they were astonished at that which was come to pass;
**2** and fear and trembling fell upon them, and there was no man remaining before his neighbor any longer, but they, having poured forth with one accord, fled upon every road of the plain and of the hill country.
**3** And they that had encamped in the hill country round about Bethulia turned to flight. And then the sons of Israel, every warrior among them, poured forth upon them.
**4** And Uzziah sent to Beth-Masthaim, and Beth-Bai, and Chobai, and Chola, and to every border of Israel, those who should declare concerning the things which had been accomplished, and that all should pour forth upon the enemies for their destruction.
**5** And when the sons of Israel heard, all of them with one accord fell upon them, and they cut them down even unto Choba. And thus also they from Jerusalem came, and from all the hill country; for they had reported unto them the things which had happened in the camp of their enemies. And they that were in Galilee and they that were in Galilee did utterly rout them with a great slaughter, until they passed Damascus and its borders.
**6** And the rest, those that inhabited Bethulia, fell upon the camp of Assyria, and they plundered them, and grew exceedingly rich.
**7** And the sons of Israel, having returned from the slaughter, took possession of the remaining spoils, and the villages and homesteads in the hill country and the plain held many spoils; for the multitude was exceeding great.
**8** And Joakim the high priest and the elders of the sons of Israel who dwelt in Jerusalem came to behold the good things which the Lord had done for Israel, and to see Judith, and to speak peace with her.
**9** And when they had entered in unto her, they blessed her, all of them with one accord, and said unto her, “Thou art the exaltation of Israel, thou art the great pride of Israel, thou art the great boast of our nation.
**10** All these things hast thou done by thy hand, doing good for Israel; and may God approve them.”
