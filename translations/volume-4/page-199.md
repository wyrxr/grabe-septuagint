ἐξεδιώκησεν τῶν Ἰουδαίων τὸ ἔθνος, καὶ ἐξεπολίτευσεν ἐπὶ πᾶσαν παρονομίαν. Ὥστε μὴ μόνον ἐπ᾿ αὐτῇ τῇ ἄκρα τῆς πατρίδος ἡμῶν γυμνάσιον κατασκευάσαι, ἀλλὰ καὶ καταλῦσαι τὴν τοῦ ἱεροῦ κηδεμονίαν. Ἐφ᾿ οἷς ἀγανακτήσασα ἡ θεία δίκη αὐτὸν τὸν Ἀντίοχον ἐπολέμησεν. Ἐπειδὴ γὰρ πολεμῶν ἦν κατ᾿ Αἴγυπτον Πτολεμαίῳ, ἤκουσέ τε, ὅτι φήμης διαδοθείσης περὶ τοῦ τεθνάναι αὐτὸν, ὡς ἔνι μάλιστα χαίροιεν εἰς Ἱεροσολυμῖται, ταχέως ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς ἀνέζευξεν. Καὶ ὡς ἐπόρθησεν αὐτοὺς, δόγμα ἔθετο, ὅπως εἴ τινες αὐτῶν φάνοιεν τῷ πατρίῳ πολιτευόμενοι νόμῳ, θάνοιεν. Καὶ ἐπεὶ κατὰ μηδένα τρόπον ἴσχυε καταλῦσαι διὰ τῶν δογμάτων τὴν τοῦ ἔθνους εὔνοιαν, ἀλλὰ πάσας τὰς ἑαυτοῦ ἀπειλὰς καὶ τιμωρίας ἑώρα καταλυομένας, ὥστε καὶ γυναῖκας, ὅτι περιέτεμον τὰ παιδία, μετὰ τῶν βρεφῶν κατακρημνισθῆναι, προειδυίας ὅτι τοῦτο πείσονται· ἐπεὶ οὖν τὰ δόγματα αὐτοῦ κατερρονεῖτο ὑπὸ τοῦ λαοῦ, αὐτὸς διὰ βασάνων ἕκαστον τοῦ ἔθνους ἠνάγκαζε μικρὸν ἀπογευομένους τροφῶν ἐξόμνυσθαι τὸν Ἰουδαϊσμόν.

ΚΕΦ. Ε.
ΠΡΟΚΛΙΝΑΣ γέ τοι μετὰ τῶν συνέδρων ὁ τύραννος Ἀντίοχος ἐπί τινος ὑψηλοῦ τόπου, καὶ τῶν στρατευμάτων αὐτῷ ἐνόπλων κυκλόθεν παρεστηκότων παρεκέλευε τοῖς δορυφόροις ἕνα ἕκαστον τῶν Ἑβραίων ἐπισπάσθαι, καὶ κρεῶν ὑείων καὶ εἰδωλοθύτων ἀναγκάζειν ἀπογεύεσθαι. Εἰ δέ τινες μὴ θελήσειαν μιαροφαγῆσαι, τούτους τροχισθέντας ἀναιρεθῆναι. Πολλῶν δὲ συναρπασθέντων εἷς πρῶτος ἐκ τῆς ἀγέλης Ἑβραῖος ὀνόματι Ἐλεάζαρος, τὸ γένος ἱερεὺς, τὴν ἐπιστήμην νομικὸς, καὶ τὴν ἡλικίαν προήκων, καὶ πολλοῖς τῶν περὶ τὸν τύραννον διὰ τὴν ἡλικίαν γνώριμος, παρήχθη πλησίον αὐτοῦ. Καὶ αὐτὸν ἰδὼν ὁ Ἀντίοχος, ἔφη· ἐγώ πρὶν ἄρξασθαι τῶν κατὰ σοῦ βασάνων, ὦ πρεσβῦτα, συμβουλεύσαιμ᾿ ἄν σοι ταῦτα ὅπως ἀπογευσάμενος τῶν ὑείων σώζοις· αἰδοῦμαι γάρ σου τὴν ἡλικίαν καὶ τὴν πολιὰν, ἣν μετὰ τοσοῦτον ἔχων χρόνον, οὐ μοι δοκεῖς φιλοσοφεῖν, τῇ Ἰουδαίων χρώμενος θρησκεία. Διατί γὰρ τῆς φύσεως κεχαρισμένης καλλίστην τὴν τοῦδε τοῦ ζώου σαρκοφαγίαν βδελύττῃ; Καὶ γὰρ

**CHAPTER IV.**

**19** ...did drive forth the nation of the Jews, and did compel them to live [according to] all lawlessness. So that he not only did build a gymnasium upon the very acropolis of our homeland, but also did abolish the guardianship of the Temple. Wherefore, divine justice, being moved to indignation, did make war against this same Antiochus. For when he was warring against Ptolemy in Egypt, he heard that, a rumour having been spread concerning his death, the inhabitants of Jerusalem did rejoice with exceeding great joy, whereupon he swiftly did march against them. And when he had sacked them, he did establish a decree, that if any among them should be found living according to the ancestral law, they should die. And inasmuch as he could in no wise destroy the goodwill of the nation by his decrees, but saw all his threats and punishments brought to naught, insomuch that even women, because they had circumcised their children, were cast headlong down with their infants, though they had foreknown that they would suffer this; when therefore his decrees were despised by the people, he himself, through tortures, did compel every one of the nation, by tasting a little of the [forbidden] meats, to foreswear Judaism.

**CHAPTER V.**

Now, Antiochus the tyrant, having indeed taken his seat with his counselors upon a certain high place, and his armed forces standing round about him, did command his spearmen to bring forth each one of the Hebrews, and to compel them to taste of swine's flesh and of meats offered unto idols. But if any would not willingly partake of defiling foods, that these should be put to death by the wheel. Now when many had been seized, one Hebrew, the first from out of the company, Eleazar by name, a priest by lineage, learned in the Law, and advanced in years, and known unto many of them that were about the tyrant by reason of his age, was brought forth nigh unto him. And Antiochus, beholding him, said: "Before I begin the tortures against thee, O ancient man, I would counsel thee thus, that by tasting of the swine's flesh thou mightest save thyself. For I reverence thy age and thy hoary hairs, which thou, having [borne] for so long a time, dost not, to my mind, demonstrate wisdom by adhering to the religion of the Jews. For why dost thou abhor the flesh-eating of this creature, which nature hath graciously made most excellent?"
