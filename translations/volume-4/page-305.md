ΠΛΗΝ τοῦ ἐπιδιδόντος τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ, καὶ διανοουμένου 1
ἐν νόμῳ ὑψίστου, σοφίαν πάντων ἀρχαίων ἐκζητήσει, καὶ ἐν προ-
φητείαις ἀσχοληθήσεται· διήγησιν ἀνδρῶν ὀνομαστῶν συντηρήσει, 2
καὶ ἐν στροφαῖς παραβολῶν συνεισελεύσεται· ἀπόκρυφα παροιμιῶν 3
ἐκζητήσει, καὶ ἐν αἰνίγματι παραβολῶν ἀναστραφήσεται. ᾿Αναμέσον 4
μεγιστάνων ὑπηρετήσει, καὶ ἔναντι ἡγουμένου ὀφθήσεται·
ἐν γῇ ἀλλοτρίων ἐθνῶν διελεύσεται, ἀγαθὰ γὰρ καὶ κακὰ ἐν ἀνθρώποις
ἐπείρασε. Τὴν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ ἐπιδώσει ὀρθρίσαι πρὸς Κύριον 5
τὸν ποιήσαντα αὐτόν, καὶ ἔναντι ὑψίστου δεηθήσεται, καὶ
ἀνοίξει στόμα αὐτοῦ ἐν προσευχῇ, καὶ περὶ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν αὐτοῦ
δεηθήσεται. ᾿Εὰν ὁ Κύριος ὁ μέγας θελήσῃ, πνεύματι συνέσεως 6
ἐμπλήσει αὐτόν· αὐτὸς ἀναβυθήσει ῥήματα σοφίας αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐν
προσευχῇ ἐξομολογήσεται Κυρίῳ· αὐτὸς κατευθυνεῖ βουλὴν αὐτοῦ 7
καὶ ἐπιστήμην, καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἀποκρύφις αὐτοῦ διανοηθήσεται·
αὐτὸς ἐκφανεῖ παιδείαν διδασκαλίας αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐν νόμῳ διαθήκης 8
Κυρίου καυχήσεται. Αἰνέσουσι τὴν σύνεσιν αὐτοῦ πολλοί, 9
καὶ ἕως τοῦ αἰῶνος οὐκ ἐξαλειφθήσεται· οὐκ ἀποστήσεται τὸ μνημόσυνον
αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ ζητήσεται εἰς γενεὰς γενεῶν·
τὴν σοφίαν αὐτοῦ διηγήσεται ἔθνη, καὶ τὸν ἔπαινον αὐτοῦ ἐξαγγελεῖ 10
ἐκκλησία. ᾿Εὰν ἀναπαύσηται, ὄνομα καταλείψει ἢ χίλιοι, καὶ 11
ἐὰν ἐμμείνῃ, ἐμποιεῖ αὐτῷ. ῎Ετι διανοηθεὶς ἐκδιηγήσομαι, καὶ 12
ὡς διχομηνία ἐπληρώθην. Εἰσακούσατέ μου υἱοὶ ὅσιοι, καὶ βλαστήσατε 13
ὡς ῥόδον φυόμενον ἐπὶ ῥεύματος ὑγροῦ, καὶ ὡς Λίβανος
εὐωδιάσατε ὀσμήν, καὶ ἀνθήσατε ἄνθος ὡς κρίνον· διάδοτε ὀσμὴν 14
καὶ αἰνέσατε ᾄσμα, εὐλογήσατε Κύριον ἐπὶ πᾶσι τοῖς ἔργοις αὐτοῦ.
Δότε τῷ ὀνόματι αὐτοῦ μεγαλοσύνην, καὶ ἐξομολογήσασθε 15
ἐν αἰνέσει αὐτοῦ ἐν ᾠδαῖς χειλέων καὶ ἐν κινύραις, καὶ οὕτως ἐρεῖτε 16
ἐν ἐξομολογήσει· τὰ ἔργα Κυρίου πάντα ὅτι καλὰ σφόδρα, καὶ πᾶν
πρόσταγμα ἐν καιρῷ αὐτοῦ ἔσται. Οὐκ ἔστιν εἰπεῖν· τί τοῦτο; εἰς τί 17
τοῦτο; πάντα γὰρ ἐν καιρῷ αὐτῶν ζητηθήσεται. ᾿Εν λόγῳ αὐτοῦ
ἔστη ὡς θημωνία ὕδωρ, καὶ ἐν ῥήματι στόματος αὐτοῦ ἀποδοχεῖα 18
ὑδάτων. ᾿Εν προστάγματι αὐτοῦ πᾶσα ἡ εὐδοκία, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν 19
ὃς ἐλαττώσει τὸ σωτήριον αὐτοῦ. ῎Εργα πάσης σαρκὸς ἐνώπιον 20
αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἔστι κρυβῆναι ἀπὸ τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν αὐτοῦ· ἀπὸ
τοῦ αἰῶνος εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα ἐπέβλεψε, καὶ οὐδέν ἐστι θαυμαστὸν 21
ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ. Οὐκ ἔστιν εἰπεῖν· τί τοῦτο, εἰς τί τοῦτο; πάντα 22
γὰρ εἰς χρείαν αὐτῶν ἔκτισται. Ἡ εὐλογία αὐτοῦ ὡς ποταμὸς 23
ἐπεκάλυψε, καὶ ὡς κατακλυσμὸς ξηρὰν ἐμέθυσεν· οὕτως ὀργὴν 24
αὐτοῦ ἔθνη κληρονομήσει, ὡς μετέστρεψεν ὕδατα εἰς ἅλμην.

**Chapter Thirty-Nine**

3 and into the depths of parables shall he enter;
    the hidden things of proverbs shall he seek out,
    and in the riddle of parables shall he be conversant.
4 Among great men shall he minister,
    and before a ruler shall he appear.
    Through the land of foreign nations shall he pass,
    for both good and evil among men hath he experienced.
5 He shall give his heart to rise early unto the Lord that made him,
    and before the Most High shall he make supplication.
    And he shall open his mouth in prayer,
    and for his own sins shall he make supplication.
6 If the Lord, the Great One, shall will [it],
    with a spirit of understanding shall He fill him.
    He shall pour forth words of His wisdom,
7 and in prayer shall he confess unto the Lord.
    He shall direct his counsel and his knowledge,
    and in His hidden things shall he meditate.
8 He shall make manifest the instruction of his teaching,
    and in the Law of the Covenant of the Lord shall he glory.
9 Many shall praise his understanding,
    and unto the age shall it not be blotted out.
    His memorial shall not depart,
    and his name shall be sought unto generations of generations.
10 His wisdom shall the nations narrate,
    and his praise shall the assembly declare.
11 If he shall rest, a name shall he leave behind,
    [more glorious] than a thousand [others];
12 and if he shall abide, it doth bring forth [fruit] for him.
    Yet, having meditated, will I recount,
    and as the half-moon was I filled.
13 Hearken unto me, ye holy sons,
    and blossom forth as a rose growing upon a moist stream.
14 And as Lebanon, make fragrant a sweet savour,
    and bloom a flower as the lily.
    Spread abroad a sweet savour, and praise a song;
    bless ye the Lord concerning all His works.
15 Give unto His Name greatness,
    and confess [unto Him] in His praise,
16 in songs of lips and upon citharas.
    And thus shall ye say in confession:
    “All the works of the Lord are exceeding good,
    and every commandment shall be [fulfilled] in its due time.”
17 It is not for one to say: “What is this? For what is this?”
    For all things in their due time shall be made plain.
18 By His Word did water stand as a heap;
    and by the utterance of His mouth, [there were] receptacles of waters.
19 In His commandment is all His good pleasure,
    and there is none that shall diminish His salvation.
20 The works of all flesh are before His face,
    and it is not possible to be hidden from His eyes.
21 From everlasting to everlasting hath He looked,
    and nothing is wonderful before Him.
22 It is not for one to say: “What is this? For what is this?”
    For all things for their need were created.
23 His blessing, as a river, did cover,
    and as a flood a dry land did it make drunk.
24 Even so His wrath shall nations inherit,
    as He turned waters into brine.
