ρίσθησαν Σίμωνι ἄνδρες τρισχίλιοι τοῦ πορευθῆναι εἰς τὴν Γαλι-
21 λαίαν, Ἰούδα δὲ ἄνδρες ὀκτακισχίλιοι εἰς τὴν Γαλααδίτιν. Καὶ
   ἐπορεύθη Σίμων εἰς τὴν Γαλιλαίαν, καὶ συνῆψε πολέμους πολλοὺς
22 πρὸς τὰ ἔθνη, καὶ συνετρίβη τὰ ἔθνη ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ· καὶ
   ἐδίωξεν αὐτοὺς ἕως τῆς Πύλης Πτολεμαΐδος· καὶ ἔπεσον ἐκ τῶν
23 ἐθνῶν εἰς τρισχιλίους ἄνδρας, καὶ ἔλαβε τὰ σκῦλα αὐτῶν. Καὶ
   παρέλαβον τοὺς ἐν τῇ Γαλιλαίᾳ καὶ ἐν Ἀρβάττοις σὺν ταῖς γυναιξὶ
   καὶ τοῖς τέκνοις, καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἦν αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἤγαγον εἰς τὴν
24 Ἰουδαίαν μετ᾽ εὐφροσύνης μεγάλης. Καὶ Ἰούδας ὁ Μακκαβαῖος
   καὶ Ἰωνάθαν ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ διέβησαν τὸν Ἰορδάνην, καὶ ἐπο-
25 ρεύθησαν ὁδὸν τριῶν ἡμερῶν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ. Καὶ συνήντησαν τοῖς
   Ναβαταίοις, καὶ ἀπήντησαν αὐτοῖς εἰρηνικῶς, καὶ διηγήσαντο αὐ-
   τοῖς ἅπαντα τὰ συμβεβηκότα τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς αὐτῶν ἐν τῇ Γαλαα-
26 δίτιδι. Καὶ ὅτι πολλοὶ ἐξ αὐτῶν συνειλημμένοι εἰσὶν εἰς Βόσ-
   σορα, καὶ Βοσσὸρ, ἐν Ἀλάμοις, Χασφὼρ, Μακὲδ, καὶ Καρναΐν.
27 πᾶσαι αἱ πόλεις αὗται ὀχυραὶ καὶ μεγάλαι. Καὶ ἐν ταῖς λοιπαῖς
   πόλεσι τῆς Γαλααδίτιδος εἰσὶ συνειλημμένοι, καὶ εἰς αὔριον τάσ-
   σονται παρεμβαλεῖν ἐπὶ τὰ ὀχυρώματα, καὶ καταλαβέσθαι καὶ ἐξᾶ-
   ραι πάντας αὐτοὺς ἐν ἡμέρᾳ μιᾷ.
28 Καὶ ἀπέστρεψεν Ἰούδας καὶ ἡ παρεμβολὴ αὐτοῦ ὁδὸν εἰς τὴν ἔρημον εἰς Βοσὸρ ἄφνω· καὶ κατε-
   λάβετο τὴν πόλιν, καὶ ἀπέκτεινε πᾶν ἀρσενικὸν ἐν στόματι ῥομ-
   φαίας, καὶ ἔλαβε πάντα τὰ σκῦλα αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐνέπρησεν αὐτὴν
   πυρί.
29 Καὶ ἀπῆρεν ἐκεῖθεν νυκτὸς , καὶ ἐπορεύετο ἕως ἐπὶ τὸ
   ὀχύρωμα.
30 Καὶ ἐγένετο ἑωθινή, καὶ ἦραν τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτῶν,
   καὶ ἰδοὺ λαὸς πολὺς οὗ οὐκ ἦν ἀριθμὸς, αἴροντες κλίμακας καὶ
   μηχανὰς καταλαβέσθαι τὸ ὀχύρωμα, καὶ ἐπολέμουν αὐτοὺς.
31 Καὶ ἴδεν Ἰούδας ὅτι ἤρκται ὁ πόλεμος, καὶ ἡ κραυγὴ τῆς πόλεως ἀ-
   νέβη ἕως τοῦ οὐρανοῦ σάλπιγξι καὶ κραυγῇ μεγάλῃ·
32 Καὶ εἶπε τοῖς ἀνδράσι τῆς δυνάμεως· πολεμήσατε σήμερον ὑπὲρ τῶν ἀδελ-
   φῶν ὑμῶν.
33 Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ἐν τρισὶν ἀρχαῖς ἐξόπισθεν αὐτῶν· καὶ
34 ἐσάλπισαν ταῖς σάλπιγξι, καὶ ἐβόησαν ἐν προσευχῇ. Καὶ ἐπέγνω
   ἡ παρεμβολὴ Τιμοθέου, ὅτι ὁ Μακκαβαῖος ἐστι, καὶ ἔφυγον ἀπὸ
   προσώπου αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτοὺς πληγῇ μεγάλῃ, καὶ ἔπε-
   σον ἐξ αὐτῶν ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ εἰς ὀκτακισχιλίους ἄνδρας.
35 Καὶ ἀπέκλινεν εἰς Μασφᾶ, καὶ ἐπολέμησεν αὐτὴν, καὶ κατελάβετο αὐ-
   τὴν, καὶ ἀπέκτεινε πᾶν ἀρσενικὸν αὐτῆς, καὶ ἔλαβε τὰ σκῦλα αὐ-

**20** ...And there were allotted unto Simon three thousand men, to go into Galilee; and unto Judas, eight thousand men, into Gilead.
**21** And Simon went into Galilee, and joined many battles against the nations; and the nations were shattered before his face,
**22** and he pursued them even unto the Gate of Ptolemais. And there fell of the nations about three thousand men, and he took their spoils.
**23** And they took them that were in Galilee and in Arbatta, with their wives and with their children, and all that they had, and brought them into Judea with great rejoicing.
**24** And Judas Maccabaeus and Jonathan his brother crossed over the Jordan, and journeyed for three days in the wilderness.
**25** And they met with the Nabataeans, who greeted them peacefully; and they recounted unto them all the things that had befallen their brethren in Gilead:
**26** that many of them had been gathered into Bosora, and Bosor, and into Alama, Chasphor, Maced, and Carnaim.
**27** All these cities are strongholds and great. And in the other cities of Gilead are [our people] gathered; and for the morrow, they are purposed to encamp against the strongholds, and to capture and to utterly destroy all of them in one day.
**28** And Judas and his army turned back by a way through the wilderness unto Bosor suddenly; and he captured the city, and slew every male by the edge of the sword, and took all their spoils, and burned it with fire.
**29** And he departed thence by night, and journeyed even unto the stronghold.
**30** And it came to pass that in the morning, they lifted up their eyes, and behold, a great people, of whom there was no number, bearing ladders and engines to capture the stronghold; and they warred against them.
**31** And Judas saw that the battle had begun, and the cry of the city ascended even unto heaven with trumpets and a great shout.
**32** And he said unto the men of [his] army, "Fight ye this day for your brethren!"
**33** And he went forth in three companies from behind them;
**34** and they blew the trumpets, and cried out in prayer. And the army of Timotheus knew that it was Maccabaeus, and they fled from his presence; and he smote them with a great slaughter, and there fell of them on that day about eight thousand men.
**35** And he turned aside unto Maspha, and fought against it, and captured it, and slew every male thereof, and took its spoils.
