ΚΕΦ. Β΄. ΜΑΚΚΑΒΑΙΩΝ Α΄. 1613
15. λέως εἶ καταναγκάζοντες τὴν ἀποστασίαν εἰς Μωδεεὶν τὴν πόλιν, ἵνα θυσιάσωσι.
16. Καὶ πολλοὶ ἀπὸ Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς αὐτοὺς προσῆλθαν· καὶ Ματταθίας καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ συνήχθησαν.
17. Καὶ ἀπεκρίθησαν οἱ παρὰ τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ εἶπαν τῷ Ματταθίᾳ, λέγοντες· ἄρχων καὶ ἔνδοξος καὶ μέγας εἶ ἐν τῇ πόλει ταύτῃ, καὶ ἐστηριγμένος ἐν υἱοῖς καὶ ἀδελφοῖς.
18. Νῦν οὖν πρόσελθε πρῶτος, καὶ ποίησον τὸ πρόσταγμα τοῦ βασιλέως, ὡς ἐποίησαν πάντα τὰ ἔθνη, καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες Ἰούδα, καὶ οἱ καταλειφθέντες ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ· καὶ ἔσῃ σὺ καὶ ὁ οἶκός σου τῶν φίλων τοῦ βασιλέως· καὶ σὺ καὶ οἱ υἱοί σου δοξασθήσεσθε ἀργυρίῳ καὶ χρυσίῳ, καὶ ἀποστολαῖς πολλαῖς.
19. Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Ματταθίας, καὶ εἶπε φωνῇ μεγάλῃ· εἰ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη τὰ ἐν οἴκῳ τῆς βασιλείας τοῦ βασιλέως ἀκούουσιν αὐτοῦ, ἀποστῆναι ἕκαστος ἀπὸ λατρείας πατέρων αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἡρετίσαντο ἐν ταῖς ἐντολαῖς αὐτοῦ,
20. ἀλλ᾽ ἐγὼ καὶ οἱ υἱοί μου καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοί μου πορευσόμεθα ἐν διαθήκῃ πατέρων ἡμῶν.
21. Ἵλεως ἡμῖν καταλιπεῖν νόμον καὶ δικαιώματα.
22. Τῶν λόγων τοῦ βασιλέως οὐκ ἀκουσόμεθα, τοῦ παρελθεῖν τὴν λατρείαν ἡμῶν δεξιὰν ἢ ἀριστεράν.
23. Καὶ ὡς ἐπαύσατο λαλῶν τοὺς λόγους τούτους, προσῆλθεν ἀνὴρ Ἰουδαῖος ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς πάντων, θυμιάσαι ἐπὶ τοῦ βωμοῦ τοῦ ἐν Μωδεεὶν κατὰ τὸ πρόσταγμα τοῦ βασιλέως.
24. Καὶ ἴδε Ματταθίας καὶ ἐζήλωσε, καὶ ἐτρόμησαν οἱ νεφροὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀνήνεγκε θυμὸν κατὰ τὸ κρῖμα, καὶ δραμὼν ἔσφαξεν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὸν βωμόν.
25. Καὶ τὸν ἄνδρα τοῦ βασιλέως τὸν ἀναγκάζοντα θύειν ἀπέκτεινεν ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ, καὶ τὸν βωμὸν καθεῖλε,
26. καὶ ἐζήλωσε τῷ νόμῳ καθὼς ἐποίησε Φινεὲς τῷ Ζαμβρὶ υἱῷ Σαλώμ.
27. Καὶ ἀνέκραξε Ματταθίας ἐν τῇ πόλει φωνῇ μεγάλῃ, λέγων· πᾶς ὁ ζηλῶν τῷ νόμῳ καὶ ἱστῶν διαθήκην, ἐξελθέτω ὀπίσω μου.
28. Καὶ ἔφυγον αὐτὸς καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ εἰς τὰ ὄρη, καὶ ἐγκατέλιπον ὅσα εἶχον ἐν τῇ πόλει.
29. Τότε κατέβησαν πολλοὶ ζητοῦντες δικαιοσύνην καὶ κρῖμα εἰς τὴν ἔρημον καθίσαι ἐκεῖ,
30. αὐτοὶ καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτῶν καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ κτήνη αὐτῶν, ὅτι ἐσκληρύνθη ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς τὰ κακά.
31. Καὶ ἀνηγγέλη τοῖς ἀνδράσι τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ ταῖς δυνάμεσιν, αἳ ἦσαν ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ πόλει Δαυΐδ, ὅτι κατέβησαν ἄνδρες, οἵτινες διεσκέδασαν τὴν ἐντολὴν τοῦ βασιλέως, εἰς τοὺς κρύφους ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ.
32. Καὶ ἔδραμον ὀπίσω αὐτῶν πολλοί, καὶ καταλαβόντες αὐτοὺς παρενέβαλον ἐπ᾽ αὐτούς, καὶ συνεστήσαντο πρὸς αὐτοὺς πόλεμον ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῶν σαββάτων,
33. καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς αὐτούς· ἕως τοῦ νῦν ἱκανόν· ἐξελθόντες ποιήσατε κατὰ τὸν λόγον τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ ζήσεσθε,
34. καὶ εἶπαν· οὐκ ἐξελευσόμεθα, οὐδὲ ποιήσομεν τὸν λόγον τοῦ βασιλέως τοῦ βεβηλῶσαι τὴν ἡμέραν τῶν σαββάτων.
35. Καὶ ἐτάχυναν ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς πόλεμον.
36. Καὶ οὐκ ἀπεκρίθησαν αὐτοῖς, οὐδὲ λίθεν ἐνετίναξαν αὐτοῖς, οὐδὲ ἐνέφραξαν τοὺς κρύφους, λέγοντες·
37. ἀποθάνωμεν οἱ πάντες ἐν τῇ ἁπλότητι ἡμῶν· μαρτυρεῖ ἐφ᾽ ἡμᾶς ὁ οὐρανὸς καὶ ἡ γῆ, ὅτι ἀκρίτως ἀπόλλυτε ἡμᾶς.
38. Καὶ ἀνέστησαν ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ τοῖς σάββασι, καὶ ἀπέθανον αὐτοὶ καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰ τέκνα αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰ κτήνη αὐτῶν ἕως χιλίων ψυχῶν ἀνθρώπων.
39. Καὶ ἔγνω Ματταθίας, καὶ οἱ φίλοι αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπένθησαν ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς ἕως σφόδρα.
40. Καὶ εἶπεν ἀνὴρ πρὸς τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ· ἐὰν πάντες ποιήσωμεν ὡς οἱ ἀδελφοὶ ἡμῶν ἐποίησαν,
41. καὶ μὴ πολεμήσωμεν εἰς τὰ ἔθνη ὑπὲρ τῆς ψυχῆς ἡμῶν καὶ τῶν δικαιωμάτων ἡμῶν, νῦν τάχιστ᾽ ἡμᾶς ὀλεθρεύσουσιν ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς,
42. καὶ ἐβουλεύσαντο τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, λέγοντες· πᾶς ἄνθρωπος ὅς ἐὰν ἔλθῃ πρὸς ἡμᾶς εἰς πόλεμον τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῶν σαββάτων, πολεμήσωμεν κατέναντι αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἀποθάνωμεν πάντες καθὼς ἀπέθανον οἱ ἀδελφοὶ ἡμῶν ἐν τοῖς κρύφοις.
43. Τότε συνήχθησαν πρὸς αὐτοὺς συναγωγὴ ᾿Ασιδαίων, ἰσχυροὶ δυνάμει ἀπὸ Ἰσραήλ, πᾶς ὁ ἐκουσιάζόμενος τῷ νόμῳ.
44. Καὶ πάντες οἱ φυγαδεύοντες ἀπὸ τῶν κακῶν προσετέθησαν αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἐγένοντο αὐτοῖς εἰς στήριγμα.
45. Καὶ συνεστήσαντο δύναμιν, καὶ ἐπάταξαν ἁμαρτωλοὺς ἐν ὀργῇ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἄνδρας ἀνόμους ἐν θυμῷ αὐτῶν·
46. καὶ οἱ λοιποὶ ἔφυγον εἰς τὰ ἔθνη σωθῆναι. Καὶ ἐκύκλωσε Ματταθίας καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ καθεῖλον τοὺς βωμοὺς αὐτῶν, καὶ
47. περιέτεμον τὰ παιδάρια τὰ ἀπερίτμητα ὅσα εὗρον ἐν ὁρίοις Ἰσραὴλ ἐν ἰσχύϊ. Καὶ ἐδίωξαν τοὺς υἱοὺς τῆς ὑπερηφανίας, καὶ
48. κατευοδώθη τὸ ἔργον ἐν χειρὶ αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἀντελάβοντο τοῦ νόμου ἐκ χειρὸς τῶν ἐθνῶν καὶ ἐκ χειρὸς τῶν βασιλέων, καὶ οὐκ ἔδωκαν κέρας τῷ ἁμαρτωλῷ.

**Chapter 2**

**15** [men] from the king [did come, even] they that did compel apostasy in the city of Modein, that men should sacrifice.
**16** And many from Israel drew nigh unto them; but Mattathias and his sons gathered themselves together.
**17** Then the [men] from the king answered, and said unto Mattathias, saying, "Thou art a ruler, and glorious, and great in this city, and strengthened in sons and brethren.
**18** Now therefore, come thou first, and perform the king's commandment, as all the nations have done, and the men of Judah, and they that remain in Jerusalem. And thou and thy house shall be among the friends of the king; and thou and thy sons shall be glorified with silver and with gold, and with many rewards."
**19** And Mattathias answered, and said with a loud voice, "Though all the nations that are in the house of the king's dominion hear him, and each one depart from the worship of his fathers, and they have chosen in his commandments,
**20** yet I and my sons and my brethren will walk in the covenant of our fathers.
**21** Far be it from us to forsake the Law and its ordinances.
**22** We will not hearken to the words of the king, to turn aside from our worship, to the right hand or to the left."
**23** And as he had ceased speaking these words, there came a certain Jew in the sight of all, to offer incense upon the altar that was in Modein, according to the king's commandment.
**24** And when Mattathias saw [it], he was inflamed with zeal, and his innermost parts trembled, and he brought forth wrath according to [God's] judgment, and ran and slew him upon the altar.
**25** He slew also the king's man, who was compelling [them] to sacrifice, at that very time, and pulled down the altar.
**26** And he was zealous for the Law, even as Phinehas did to Zimri, the son of Salu.
**27** And Mattathias cried aloud in the city with a great voice, saying, "Whosoever is zealous for the Law, and maintaineth the covenant, let him follow me!"
**28** And he and his sons fled into the mountains, and left all that they had in the city.
**29** Then many that sought righteousness and judgment went down into the wilderness to dwell there,
**30** they, and their sons, and their wives, and their cattle, because the evils had grown sore upon them.
**31** And it was reported unto the king's men, and unto the forces that were in Jerusalem, the city of David, that men, who had broken the king's commandment, had gone down into the hidden places in the wilderness.
**32** And many ran after them, and having overtaken them, encamped against them, and set the battle in array against them on the Sabbath day.
**33** And they said unto them, "Hitherto hath it been enough; come ye forth and do according to the word of the king, and ye shall live."
**34** But they said, "We will not come forth, neither will we do the word of the king, to profane the Sabbath day."
**35** And [the king's men] hastened to make war upon them.
**36** And they answered them not, neither did they cast a stone at them, neither did they block up their secret places, saying,
**37** "Let us all die in our integrity; Heaven and earth bear witness for us that ye destroy us unjustly."
**38** So they rose up against them in battle on the Sabbath, and they died, both they and their wives, and their children, and their cattle, even a thousand souls of men.
**39** And Mattathias and his friends knew [it], and they mourned for them exceedingly.
**40** And one man said unto his neighbour, "If we all do as our brethren have done,
**41** and fight not against the Gentiles for our lives and our ordinances, then will they now quickly destroy us from the earth."
**42** So they counselled on that day, saying, "Whosoever shall come against us to battle on the Sabbath day, let us fight against him, and we shall not all die as our brethren died in the secret places."
**43** Then there gathered unto them a congregation of Hasideans, mighty men of strength from Israel, every one who was willingly devoted unto the Law.
**44** And all they that fled from the evils were added unto them, and they became a support unto them.
**45** And they arrayed a force, and smote the sinners in their wrath, and the lawless men in their fury;
**46** and the rest fled unto the Gentiles to save themselves. And Mattathias and his sons went about, and pulled down their altars, and
**47** circumcised all the uncircumcised children whom they found within the borders of Israel, with [great] might. And they pursued the sons of pride, and
**48** the work prospered in their hand. And they recovered the Law out of the hand of the Gentiles and out of the hand of kings, and they gave no strength to the sinner.
