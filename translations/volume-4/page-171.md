ΜΑΚΚΑΒΑΙΩΝ Β΄. ΚΕΦ. ΙΔ΄.
32 διδόναι τὸν ἄνδρα. Τῶν δὲ μεθ᾽ ὅρκων φασκόντων μὴ γινώσκειν
33 ποῦ ποτ᾽ ἐστὶν ὁ ζητούμενος, προτείνας τὴν δεξιὰν εἰς τὸν νεών, ὤμοσε ταῦτα· ἐὰν μὴ δέσμιόν μοι τὸν Ἰούδαν παραδῶτε, τόνδε
34 τὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ σηκὸν εἰς πεδίον ποιήσω, καὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον κατασκάψω, καὶ ἱερὸν ἐνταῦθα τῷ Διονύσῳ ἐπιφανὲς ἀναστήσω. Τοσαῦτα δὲ εἰπὼν ἀπῆλθεν·
35 οἱ δὲ ἱερεῖς προτείναντες τὰς χεῖρας εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν ἐπεκαλοῦντο τὸν διαπαντὸς ὑπέρμαχον τοῦ ἔθνους
36 ἡμῶν, ταῦτα λέγοντες. Σὺ Κύριε, τῶν ὅλων ἀπροσδεὴς ὑπάρχων, ηὐδόκησας ναὸν τῆς σῆς σκηνώσεως ἐν ἡμῖν γενέσθαι. Καὶ
37 νῦν, ἁγιε παντὸς ἁγιασμοῦ Κύριε, διατήρησον εἰς αἰῶνα ἀμίαντον τόνδε τὸν προσφάτως κεκαθαρισμένον οἶκον. Ῥαζῆς δέ τις
38 τῶν ἀπὸ Ἱεροσολύμων πρεσβυτέρων, ἐμνύθη τῷ Νικάνορι, ἀνὴρ φιλοπολίτης καὶ σφόδρα καλῶς ἀκούων, καὶ κατὰ τὴν εὔνοιαν
39 πατὴρ τῶν Ἰουδαίων προσαγορευόμενος. Ἦν γὰρ ἐν τοῖς ἔμπροσθεν χρόνοις τῆς ἀμιξίας κρίσιν εἰσενηνεγμένος Ἰουδαϊσμοῦ, καὶ σῶμα καὶ ψυχὴν ὑπὲρ τοῦ Ἰουδαϊσμοῦ παραβεβλημένος κατὰ
40 πάσης ἐκτενείας. Βουλόμενος δὲ Νικάνωρ πρόδηλον ποιῆσαι, ἣν εἶχε πρὸς τοὺς Ἰουδαίους, δυσμένειαν, ἀπέστειλε στρατιώτας ὑπὲρ τοὺς πεντακοσίους συλλαβεῖν αὐτόν. Ἔδοξε γὰρ ἐκεῖνον συλλαβών,
41 τούτοις ἐνεργάσασθαι συμφοράν. Τῶν δὲ πληθῶν μελλόντων τὸν πύργον καταλαβέσθαι, καὶ τὴν αὐλαίαν θύραν βιαζομένων,
42 καὶ κελευόντων πῦρ προσάγειν, καὶ τὰς θύρας δράττειν, περικατάληπτος γενόμενος ὑπέθηκεν ἑαυτῷ τὸ ξίφος· εὐγενῶς
43 θέλων ἀποθανεῖν, ἤπερ τοῖς ἀλιτηρίοις ὑποχείριος γενέσθαι, καὶ τῆς ἰδίας εὐγενείας ἀναξίως ὑβρισθῆναι. Τῇ δὲ πληγῇ μὴ κατευθικτήσας
44 διὰ τὴν τοῦ ἀγῶνος σπουδὴν, καὶ τῶν ὄχλων ἔσω τῶν θυρωμάτων εἰσβαλλόντων, ἀναδραμὼν γενναίως ἐπὶ τὸ τεῖχος, κατεκρήμνισεν ἑαυτὸν ἀνδρωδῶς εἰς τοὺς ὄχλους. Τῶν δὲ
45 ταχέως ἀποδεισάντων, γενομένου διαστήματος, ἦλθε κατὰ μέσον τὸν κενεῶνα. Ἔτι δὲ ἔμπνους ὑπάρχων καὶ πεπυρωμένος
46 ταῖς θυμοῖς, ἐξαναζὰς φερομένων κρουνηδὸν τῶν αἱμάτων, καὶ δυσχερῶν τῶν τραυμάτων ὄντων, δρόμῳ τοὺς ὄχλους διελθὼν, καὶ στὰς
47 ἐπὶ τινος πέτρας ἀποξουγωτὸς, παντελῶς ἐξαιμος ἤδη γενόμενος, προβαλὼν τὰ ἔντερα καὶ λαβὼν ἑκατέραις ταῖς χερσίν, ἐνέσεισε τοῖς ὄχλοις· καὶ ἐπικαλεσάμενος τὸν δεσπόζοντα τῆς ζωῆς καὶ τοῦ πνεύματος ταῦτα αὐτῷ πάλιν ἀποδοῦναι, τόνδε τὸν τρόπον μετήλλαξεν.

**Chapter 14**

**32** to deliver up the man. But they, having sworn by oaths, did affirm that they knew not
**33** where the man sought for might be. Then [Nicanor], stretching forth his right hand into the temple, did swear these words: “If ye deliver not Judas, the captive, unto me, this
**34** sanctuary of God shall I lay waste as a plain, and the altar will I utterly destroy, and here shall I raise up a glorious temple unto Dionysus.” And having spoken these things, he departed.
**35** But the priests, stretching forth their hands unto heaven, did call upon the Everlasting Defender of our nation,
**36** saying these things: “Thou, O Lord, Who art in need of nothing, yet wast pleased that a temple for Thy habitation should be made amongst us.
**37** And now, O Holy Lord of all holiness, do Thou preserve this house, which hath been but lately cleansed, unpolluted for evermore.” Now Razis, one of the
**38** elders of Jerusalem, was denounced unto Nicanor; a man who loved his country, and was held in great esteem, and by reason of his benevolence,
**39** was called the father of the Jews. For in times past, in the season of separation, he had brought forth a judgment concerning Judaism, and had offered both body and soul on behalf of Judaism with all
**40** fervent zeal. But Nicanor, desiring to make manifest the malice which he bore against the Jews, did send forth soldiers, above five hundred in number, to apprehend him. For he thought that by apprehending him,
**41** he should inflict great calamity upon them. And when the multitudes were about to seize the tower, and were forcing the courtyard gate,
**42** and commanding to bring fire and to lay hold upon the doors, Razis, having been surrounded, put the sword unto himself; nobly
**43** desiring to die, rather than to fall into the hands of the impious, and to be dishonored in a manner unworthy of his noble birth. But not having struck the blow directly [unto death]
**44** by reason of the haste of the struggle, and the crowds pressing in within the gates, he nobly ran up to the wall, and manfully hurled himself down into the midst of the throngs. And when they had
**45** quickly drawn back, a space being made, he fell into the midst of the void. And being yet alive and inflamed
**46** with rage, having risen up, though his blood streamed forth like torrents, and his wounds were grievous, he ran through the throngs, and standing
**47** upon a certain rock, utterly stripped [of his flesh] and now wholly bloodless, he drew forth his intestines, and taking them with both his hands, he did cast them at the throngs; and calling upon Him Who is Lord of life and of the spirit, that He might restore these unto him again, in this wise did he depart [from life].
