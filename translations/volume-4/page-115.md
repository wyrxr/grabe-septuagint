παρενέβαλεν ἐπὶ ᾿Ασκάλωνα, καὶ ἐξῆλθον οἱ ἐκ τῆς πόλεως εἰς
87 συνάντησιν αὐτῷ ἐν δόξῃ μεγάλῃ. Καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν ᾿Ιωνάθαν εἰς
88 ῾Ιερουσαλὴμ σὺν τοῖς παρ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἔχοντες σκῦλα πολλά. Καὶ
    ἐγένετο ὡς ἤκουσεν ᾿Αλέξανδρος ὁ βασιλεὺς τοὺς λόγους τούτους,
89 καὶ προσέθετο δοξάσαι τὸν ᾿Ιωνάθαν. Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν αὐτῷ πόρ-
    πην χρυσῆν, ὡς ἔθος ἐστὶ δίδοσθαι τοῖς συγγενέσι τῶν βασι-
    λέων· καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ τὴν ᾿Ακκαρὼν καὶ πάντα τὰ ὅρια αὐ-
    τῆς εἰς κληροδοσίαν.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΑ΄.

1   ΚΑΙ ὁ βασιλεὺς Αἰγύπτου ἤθροισε δυνάμεις πολλὰς ὡς ἡ ἄμ-
    μος ἡ παρὰ τὸ χεῖλος τῆς θαλάσσης, καὶ πλοῖα πολλά· καὶ ἐζή-
    τησε κατακρατῆσαι τῆς βασιλείας ᾿Αλεξάνδρου δόλῳ, καὶ προσ-
2   θεῖναι αὐτὴν τῇ βασιλείᾳ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν εἰς Συρίαν λό-
    γοις εἰρηνικοῖς, καὶ ἤνοιγον αὐτῷ οἱ ἀπὸ τῶν πόλεων, καὶ συνήν-
    των αὐτῷ, ὅτι ἐντολὴ ἦν ᾿Αλεξάνδρου τοῦ βασιλέως συναντᾶν
3   αὐτῷ διὰ τὸ πενθερὸν αὐτοῦ εἶναι. Ὡς δὲ εἰσεπορεύετο εἰς τὰς
    πόλεις ὁ Πτολεμαῖος, ἀπέτασσε τὰς δυνάμεις φρουρὰν ἐν ἑκά-
4   στῃ πόλει. Ὡς δὲ ἤγγισεν ᾿Αζώτου, ἔδειξαν αὐτῷ τὸ ἱερὸν Δα-
    γὼν ἐμπεπυρισμένον, καὶ ᾿Αζωτον καὶ τὰ περιπόλια αὐτῆς κα-
    θῃρημένα, καὶ τὰ σώματα ἐῤῥιμμένα, καὶ τοὺς ἐμπεπυρισμένους,
    οὓς ἐνεπύρισεν ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ, ἐποίησαν γὰρ θημωνίας αὐτῶν ἐν
5   τῇ ὁδῷ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ διηγήσαντο τῷ βασιλεῖ ἃ ἐποίησεν ᾿Ιωνάθαν
6   εἰς τὸ ψογῆσαι αὐτόν· καὶ ἐσίγησεν ὁ βασιλεύς. Καὶ συνήντη-
    σεν ᾿Ιωνάθαν τῷ βασιλεῖ εἰς ᾿Ιόππην μετὰ δόξης, καὶ ἠσπάσαντο
7   ἀλλήλους, καὶ ἐκοιμήθησαν ἐκεῖ. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη ᾿Ιωνάθαν μετὰ
    τοῦ βασιλέως ἕως τοῦ ποταμοῦ τοῦ καλουμένου ᾿Ελευθέρου, καὶ
8   ἐπέστρεψεν εἰς ῾Ιερουσαλήμ. Ὁ δὲ βασιλεὺς Πτολεμαῖος ἐκυ-
    ρίευσε τῶν πόλεων τῆς παραλίας ἕως Σελευκείας τῆς παραθα-
    λασσίας, καὶ διελογίζετο περὶ ᾿Αλεξάνδρου λογισμοὺς πονηρούς.
9   Καὶ ἀπέστειλε πρέσβεις πρὸς Δημήτριον βασιλέα, λέγων· Δεῦ-
    ρο συνθώμεθα πρὸς ἑαυτοὺς διαθήκην, καὶ δώσω σοι τὴν θυγα-
    τέρα μου ἣν ἔχει ᾿Αλέξανδρος, καὶ βασιλεύσεις τῆς βασιλείας τοῦ
10  πατρός σου. Μεταμεμέλημαι γὰρ δοὺς αὐτῷ τὴν θυγατέρα μου,
11  ἐζήτησε γὰρ ἀποκτεῖναί με. Καὶ ἐψόγισεν αὐτὸν χάριν τοῦ ἐπι-

**10:86** encamped against Ascalon; and those of the city went forth to meet him with great glory.
**10:87** And Jonathan returned unto Jerusalem,
**10:88** with those that were with him, having much spoil. And it came to pass, when Alexander the king heard these words,
**10:89** he resolved to glorify Jonathan further. And he sent unto him a golden buckle, as it is the custom to give unto the kinsfolk of kings; and he gave him Accaron with all its borders for an inheritance.

**Chapter 11**

**11:1** And the king of Egypt gathered together many forces, even as the sand which is by the seashore, and many ships; and he sought to take the kingdom of Alexander by deceit, and to add it unto his own kingdom.
**11:2** And he went forth into Syria with peaceful words; and those of the cities opened [their gates] unto him, and met him; for it was the commandment of Alexander the king that they should meet him, because he was his father-in-law.
**11:3** And as Ptolemy entered into the cities, he detached forces as a garrison in every city.
**11:4** Now when he drew nigh unto Azotus, they showed him the temple of Dagon that was burned with fire, and Azotus and its surrounding territories, that were razed; and the bodies [of the slain] were strewn [about], even those that had been burned, whom Jonathan had consumed by fire in the war, for they had made heaps of them upon his way.
**11:5** And they recounted unto the king what things Jonathan had done,
**11:6** with intent to accuse him; but the king held his peace. And Jonathan met the king in Joppa with great glory, and they saluted one another, and lodged there.
**11:7** And Jonathan went with the king even unto the river called Eleutherus, and returned unto Jerusalem.
**11:8** But Ptolemy the king took possession of the cities of the coastland, even unto Seleucia by the sea; and he harbored evil designs against Alexander.
**11:9** And he sent envoys unto Demetrius the king, saying: Come thou, let us make a covenant between ourselves, and I will give thee my daughter, whom Alexander hath, and thou shalt reign over the kingdom of thy
**11:10** father. For I repent that I gave him my daughter,
**11:11** for he sought to slay me. And he reproached him because he desired [to possess]
