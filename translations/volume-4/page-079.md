ζεύχθησαν τοῖς ἔθνεσι, καὶ ἐπράθησαν τοῦ ποιῆσαι τὸ πονηρόν.
16 Καὶ ἡτοιμάσθη ἡ βασιλεία ἐνώπιον Ἀντιόχου· καὶ ὑπέλαβε βα-
σιλεύσαι γῆς Αἰγύπτου, ὅπως βασιλεύσῃ ἐπὶ τὰς δύο βασιλείας.
17 Καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς Αἴγυπτον ἐν ὄχλῳ βαρεί, ἐν ἅρμασι, καὶ ἐν
18 ἐλέφασι, καὶ ἐν ἱππεῦσι, καὶ ἐν στόλῳ μεγάλῳ. Καὶ συνεστήσατο
πόλεμον πρὸς Πτολεμαῖον τὸν βασιλέα Αἰγύπτου· καὶ ἐνετράπη
Πτολεμαῖος ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔφυγε· καὶ ἔπεσαν τραυ-
19 ματίαι πολλοί. Καὶ κατελάβοντο τὰς πόλεις τὰς ὀχυρὰς ἐν γῇ
20 Αἰγύπτω· καὶ ἔλαβε τὰ σκῦλα γῆς Αἰγύπτου. Καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν
Ἀντίοχος μετὰ τὸ πατάξαι Αἴγυπτον ἐν τῷ ἑκατοστῷ καὶ τεσ-
σαρακοστῷ καὶ τρίτῳ ἔτει· καὶ ἀνέβη ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ εἰς Ἱερο-
21 σόλυμα ἐν ὄχλῳ βαρεί. Καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸ ἁγίασμα ἐν ὑπερη-
φανείᾳ, καὶ ἔλαβε τὸ θυσιαστήριον τὸ χρυσοῦν, καὶ τὴν λυχνίαν
22 τοῦ φωτός, καὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη αὐτῆς, καὶ τὴν τράπεζαν τῆς
προθέσεως, καὶ τὰ σπονδεῖα, καὶ τὰς φιάλλας, καὶ τὰς θυΐσκας
τὰς χρυσᾶς, καὶ τὸ καταπέτασμα, καὶ τοὺς στεφάνους, καὶ τὸν
23 κόσμον τὸν χρυσοῦν τὸν κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ ναοῦ, καὶ ἐλέπισε
πάντα, καὶ ἔλαβε τὸ ἀργύριον, καὶ τὸ χρυσίον, καὶ τὰ σκεύη τὰ
ἐπιθυμητά· καὶ ἔλαβε τοὺς θησαυροὺς τοὺς ἀποκρύφους οὓς εὗρε,
24 καὶ λαβὼν πάντα ἀπῆλθεν εἰς τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐποίησε φο-
25 νοκτονίαν, καὶ ἐλάλησεν ὑπερηφανείαν μεγάλην. Καὶ ἐγένετο πέν-
θος μέγα ἐπὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐν παντὶ τόπῳ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐστέναζαν ἄρ-
26 χοντες καὶ πρεσβύτεροι, παρθένοι καὶ νεανίσκοι ἠσθένησαν, καὶ
27 τὸ κάλλος τῶν γυναικῶν ἠλλοιώθη. Πᾶς νυμφίος ἀνέλαβε θρῆνον,
28 καὶ καθημένη ἐν παστῷ ἐγένετο ἐν πένθει. Καὶ ἐσείσθη ἡ γῆ ἐπὶ
τοὺς κατοικοῦντας αὐτήν· καὶ πᾶς ὁ οἶκος Ἰακὼβ ἐνεδύσατο αἰ-
29 σχύνην. Καὶ μετὰ δύο ἔτη ἡμερῶν ἀπέστειλεν ὁ βασιλεὺς ἄρ-
χοντα φορολογίας εἰς τὰς πόλεις Ἰούδα· καὶ ἦλθεν εἰς Ἱερουσα-
30 λὴμ ἐν ὄχλῳ βαρεί. Καὶ ἐλάλησεν αὐτοῖς λόγους εἰρηνικοὺς ἐν δό-
λῳ, καὶ ἐπίστευσαν αὐτῷ, καὶ ἐπέπεσεν ἐπὶ τὴν πόλιν ἐξάπινα,
καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτὴν πληγὴν μεγάλην, καὶ ἀπώλεσε λαὸν πολὺν
31 ἐξ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἔλαβε τὰ σκῦλα τῆς πόλεως, καὶ ἐνεπύρισεν
αὐτὴν πυρί, καὶ καθεῖλε τοὺς οἴκους αὐτῆς καὶ τὰ τείχη αὐτῆς
32 κύκλῳ· Καὶ ᾐχμαλώτευσαν τὰς γυναῖκας καὶ τὰ τέκνα, καὶ τὰ
33 κτήνη ἐκληρονόμησαν. Καὶ ᾠκοδόμησαν τὴν πόλιν Δαυΐδ τείχει
μεγάλῳ καὶ ὀχυρῷ, πύργοις ὀχυροῖς, καὶ ἐγένετο αὐτοῖς εἰς ἀκράν.

**Note on OCR Correction for verse 33:** The OCR rendered the word `ἀκράν` (akran, meaning citadel or stronghold) as `αχραν`. As `αχραν` is not a recognized Greek word and renders the sentence ungrammatical and textually improbable in context, this has been corrected to `ἀκράν` in the original text, as it represents the most minimal correction of a letter to produce a grammatically and textually appropriate word. This change is made despite the instruction not to alter spelling, based on the overriding directive to correct "clearly typos: Undocumented variants that create an ungrammatical or textually improbable translation" and to faithfully render the text.

**16** And they were joined unto the nations, and were sold to do evil.

**16** Now the kingdom was established before Antiochus; and he purposed in his heart to reign over the land of Egypt, that he might reign over the two kingdoms.
**17** And he entered into Egypt with a mighty host, with chariots, and with
**18** elephants, and with horsemen, and with a great fleet. And he waged war against Ptolemy, the king of Egypt; and Ptolemy was turned back from before his face, and fled; and many wounded men fell.
**19** And they took possession of the fortified cities in the land of Egypt;
**20** and he took the spoils of the land of Egypt. And Antiochus returned after he had smitten Egypt, in the one hundred and forty-third year; and he went up against Israel, and against Jerusalem with a mighty host.
**21** And he entered into the sanctuary with great pride, and took the golden altar,
**22** and the lampstand of light, and all its vessels, and the table of the shewbread, and the libation bowls, and the phials, and the golden censers, and the veil, and the crowns,
**23** and the golden ornament that was before the temple; and he stripped everything. And he took the silver, and the gold, and the desirable vessels; and he took the hidden treasures which he found.
**24** And having taken all, he departed into his own land. And he made great slaughter, and spoke with great pride.
**25** And there was great mourning over Israel in every place of theirs; and
**26** rulers and elders groaned; virgins and young men languished; and the beauty of the women was altered.
**27** Every bridegroom took up lamentation,
**28** and she that sat in the bridal chamber was in mourning. And the earth was shaken for those who dwelt therein; and all the house of Jacob was clothed with shame.
**29** And after two years, the king sent an officer of taxation into the cities of Judah;
**30** and he came to Jerusalem with a mighty host. And he spoke to them words of peace deceitfully, and they believed him; and he fell upon the city suddenly, and smote it with a great blow, and destroyed many people from Israel.
**31** And he took the spoils of the city, and burned it with fire, and pulled down its houses and its walls roundabout.
**32** And they took captive the women and the children, and they inherited the livestock.
**33** And they built the city of David with a great and strong wall, with strong towers; and it became to them a stronghold.
