ΜΑΚΚΑΒΑΙΩΝ Α.
ΚΕΦΑΛΑΙΟΝ. Α'. Ι.
ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο μετὰ τὸ πατάξαι Ἀλέξανδρον τὸν Φιλίππου τὸν 1
Μακεδόνα, ὃς ἐξῆλθεν ἐκ τῆς γῆς Χεττιείμ, καὶ ἐπάταξε τὸν Δα-
ρεῖον βασιλέα Περσῶν καὶ Μήδων, καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν ἀντ’ αὐτοῦ
πρότερον ἐπὶ τὴν Ἑλλάδα. Καὶ συνεστήσατο πολέμους πολλοὺς, 2
καὶ ἐκράτησεν ὀχυρωμάτων πολλῶν, καὶ ἔσφαξε βασιλεῖς τῆς γῆς.
Καὶ διῆλθεν ἕως ἄκρων τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἔλαβε σκῦλα πλήθους ἐθνῶν· 3
καὶ ἡσύχασεν ἡ γῆ ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὑψώθη, καὶ ἐπήρθη ἡ καρ-
δία αὐτοῦ. Καὶ συνῆξε δύναμιν ἰσχυρὰν σφόδρα, καὶ ἦρξε χωρῶν, 4
καὶ ἐθνῶν, καὶ τυραννιῶν, καὶ ἐγένοντο αὐτῷ εἰς φόρον. Καὶ μετὰ 5
ταῦτα ἔπεσεν ἐπὶ τὴν κοίτην, καὶ ἔγνω ὅτι ἀποθνήσκει. Καὶ ἐκά- 6
λεσε τοὺς παῖδας αὐτοῦ τοὺς ἐνδόξους τοὺς συνεκτρόφους αὐτοῦ
ἀπὸ νεότητος, καὶ διεῖλεν αὐτοῖς τὴν βασιλείαν αὐτοῦ ἔτι ζῶντος
αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Ἀλέξανδρος ἔτη δώδεκα, καὶ ἀπέθανε. 7
Καὶ ἐπεκράτησαν οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ ἕκαστος ἐν τῷ τόπῳ αὐτοῦ. 8
Καὶ ἐπέθεντο πάντες διαδήματα μετὰ τὸ ἀποθανεῖν αὐτὸν, καὶ οἱ 9
υἱοὶ αὐτῶν ὀπίσω αὐτῶν ἔτη πολλὰ, καὶ ἐπλήθυναν καλὰ ἐν τῇ
γῇ. Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ἐξ αὐτῶν ῥίζα ἁμαρτωλὸς Ἀντίοχος Ἐπιφανὴς, 10
υἱὸς Ἀντιόχου τοῦ βασιλέως, ὃς ἦν ὅμηρα ἐν τῇ Ῥώμῃ· καὶ ἐβα-
σίλευσεν ἐν ἔτει ἑκατοστῷ καὶ ἑβδόμῳ καὶ τριακοστῷ βασιλείας
Ἑλλήνων. Ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις ἐξῆλθον ἐξ Ἰσραὴλ υἱοὶ πα- 11
ράνομοι, καὶ ἀνέπεισαν πολλοὺς, λέγοντες· πορευθῶμεν, καὶ δια-
θώμεθα διαθήκην μετὰ τῶν ἐθνῶν τῶν κύκλῳ ἡμῶν, ὅτι ἀφ᾽ ἧς ἐ-
χωρίσθημεν ἀπ᾽ αὐτῶν, εὗρεν ἡμᾶς κακὰ πολλὰ. Καὶ ἠγαθύνθη 12
ὁ λόγος ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτῶν. Καὶ προεθυμήθησαν τινες ἀπὸ τοῦ 13
λαοῦ, καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα· καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς ἐξου-
σίαν ποιῆσαι τὰ δικαιώματα τῶν ἐθνῶν. Καὶ ᾠκοδόμησαν γυμνά- 14
σιον ἐν Ἱεροσολύμοις κατὰ τὰ νόμιμα τῶν ἐθνῶν. Καὶ ἐποίησαν 15

**THE FIRST BOOK OF THE MACCABEES**
**CHAPTER ONE**

**1** And it came to pass, after that Alexander, the son of Philip, the Macedonian, who went forth from the land of Kittim, had smitten Darius, King of Persia and Media, that he reigned in his stead, first over Greece.
**2** And he waged many wars, and conquered many strongholds, and slew the kings of the earth.
**3** And he passed through even unto the ends of the earth, and took spoil from a multitude of nations; and the earth was at peace before him. And he was exalted, and his heart was lifted up.
**4** And he gathered a very mighty army, and ruled over lands, and nations, and dominions; and they became unto him as tribute.
**5** And after these things, he fell upon his bed, and perceived that he should die.
**6** And he called his renowned officers, his companions who were brought up with him from his youth, and divided his kingdom among them whilst he was yet alive.
**7** And Alexander reigned twelve years, and died.
**8** And his successors prevailed, each in his own place.
**9** And all of them put on diadems after he had died, and their sons after them for many years; and they multiplied evils in the earth.
**10** And there came forth from them a sinful root, Antiochus Epiphanes, son of Antiochus the king, who had been a hostage in Rome; and he reigned in the one hundred and thirty-seventh year of the kingdom of the Greeks.
**11** In those days there came forth from Israel lawless sons, who persuaded many, saying, "Let us go and make a covenant with the nations round about us; for since we were separated from them, many evils have found us."
**12** And the word was good in their eyes.
**13** And some of the people were eager, and went unto the king; and he gave them authority to perform the customs of the nations.
**14** And they built a gymnasium in Jerusalem according to the customs of the nations.
**15** And they made themselves uncircumcised, and departed from the holy covenant; and they were joined unto the nations, and were sold to do evil.
