πρινὴ θεῖναι αὐτὸν μετὰ Ἀλεξάνδρου καθ᾿ ἡμῶν. Μνησθήσεται
γὰρ πάντων τῶν κακῶν, ὧν συνετελέσαμεν πρὸς αὐτόν, καὶ εἰς
τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἰς τὸ ἔθνος αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ
ἐξουσίαν συναγαγεῖν δυνάμεις, καὶ κατασκευάζειν ὅπλα, καὶ εἶναι
αὐτὸν σύμμαχον αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰ ὅμηρα τὰ ἐν τῇ ἄκρα εἶπε παραδοῦναι
αὐτῷ. Καὶ ἦλθεν Ἰωνάθαν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἀνέγνω τὰς ἐπιστολὰς
εἰς τὰ ὦτα παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ τῶν ἐκ τῆς ἄκρας. Καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν
φόβον μέγαν ὅτε ἤκουσαν, ὅτι ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐξουσίαν
συναγαγεῖν δυνάμεις. Καὶ παρέδωκαν οἱ ἐκ τῆς ἄκρας Ἰωνάθαν
τὰ ὅμηρα, καὶ ἀπέδωκεν αὐτοὺς τοῖς γονεῦσιν αὐτῶν. Καὶ ᾤκησεν
Ἰωνάθαν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἤρξατο οἰκοδομεῖν καὶ καινίζειν τὴν πόλιν.
Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς τοὺς ποιοῦντας τὰ ἔργα οἰκοδομεῖν τὰ τείχη καὶ τὸ
ὄρος Σιὼν κυκλόθεν ἐκ λίθων τετραγώνων εἰς ὀχύρωσιν, καὶ ἐποίησαν
οὕτως. Καὶ ἔφυγον οἱ ἀλλογενεῖς οἱ ὄντες ἐν τοῖς ὀχυρώμασιν, οἷς
ᾠκοδόμησεν ὁ Βακχίδης. Καὶ κατέλιπεν ἕκαστος τὸν τόπον αὐτοῦ,
καὶ ἀπῆλθεν εἰς τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ. Πλὴν ἐν Βαιθσούρα ὑπελείφθησάν
τινες τῶν καταλιπόντων τὸν νόμον καὶ τὰ προστάγματα· ἦν γὰρ αὐτοῖς
φυγαδευτήριον. Καὶ ἤκουσεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἀλέξανδρος τὰς ἐπαγγελίας,
ὅσας ἀπέστειλε Δημήτριος τῷ Ἰωνάθαν, καὶ διηγήσαντο αὐτῷ τοὺς
πολέμους καὶ τὰς ἀνδραγαθίας , ἃς ἐποίησεν αὐτὸς καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ
αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοὺς κόπους οὓς ἔσχοσαν. Καὶ εἶπε· μὴ εὑρήσομεν ἄνδρα
τοιοῦτον ἕνα; καὶ νῦν ποιήσωμεν αὐτὸν φίλον καὶ σύμμαχον ἡμῶν.
Καὶ ἔγραψεν ἐπιστολάς, καὶ ἀπέστειλεν αὐτῷ κατὰ τοὺς λόγους
τούτους, λέγων· Βασιλεὺς Ἀλέξανδρος τῷ ἀδελφῷ Ἰωνάθαν χαίρειν.
Ἀκηκόαμεν περὶ σοῦ, ὅτι ἀνὴρ δυνατὸς ἰσχύϊ καὶ ἐπιτήδειος εἶ τοῦ
εἶναι ἡμῶν φίλος. Καὶ νῦν καθεστάκαμέν σε σήμερον ἀρχιερέα τοῦ
ἔθνους σου, καὶ φίλον βασιλέως καλεῖσθαι, (καὶ ἀπέστειλεν αὐτῷ
πορφύραν καὶ στέφανον χρυσοῦν,) καὶ φρονεῖν τὰ ἡμῶν καὶ συντηρεῖν
φιλίαν πρὸς ἡμᾶς. Καὶ ἐνεδύσατο Ἰωνάθαν τὴν ἁγίαν στολὴν τῷ
ἑβδόμῳ μηνὶ ἔτους ἑξηκοστοῦ καὶ ἑκατοστοῦ ἐν ἑορτῇ σκηνοπηγίας,
καὶ συνήγαγε δυνάμεις, καὶ κατεσκεύασεν ὅπλα πολλά. Καὶ ἤκουσε
Δημήτριος τοὺς λόγους τούτους, καὶ ἐλυπήθη. καὶ εἶπε· Τί τοῦτο
ἐποιήσαμεν, ὅτι προέφθακεν ἡμᾶς ὁ Ἀλέξανδρος τοῦ φιλίαν καταθέσθαι
τοῖς Ἰουδαίοις εἰς στήριγμα; Γράφω κἀγὼ αὐτοῖς λόγους
παρακλήσεως καὶ ὕψους καὶ δομάτων, ὅπως ὦσι σὺν ἐμοὶ εἰς βοήθειαν.
