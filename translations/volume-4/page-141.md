**19** ...ἀγεληδὸν ἐξεπήδων ἐπὶ πάνδημον ἱκετείαν, διὰ τὸ μὴ μέλλειν εἰς καταφρόνησιν ἔρχεσθαι τὸν τόπον.
**20** Ἔγκλειστοι τῶν παρθένων, αἱ μὲν συνέτρεχον ἐπὶ τοὺς πυλῶνας, αἱ δὲ ἐπὶ τὰ τείχη, τινὲς δὲ διὰ τῶν θυρίδων διεξέκυπτον. Πᾶσαι δὲ προτείνουσαι τὰς χεῖρας εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν ἐποιοῦντο τὴν λιτανείαν.
**21** Ἐλεεῖν δὲ ἦν τὴν τοῦ πλήθους παμμιγῆ πρόπτωσιν,
**22** τήν τε τοῦ μεγάλως ἀγωνιῶντος ἀρχιερέως προσδοκίαν. Οἱ μὲν οὖν ἐπεκαλοῦντο τὸν παγκρατῆ Κύριον τὰ πεπιστευμένα τοῖς
**23** πεπιστευκόσι σῶα διαφυλάσσειν μετὰ πάσης ἀσφαλείας.
**24** Ὁ δὲ Ἡλιόδωρος τὸ διεγνωσμένον ἐπετέλει. Αὐτόθι δὲ αὐτοῦ σὺν τοῖς δορυφόροις κατὰ τὸ γαζοφυλάκιον ἤδη παρόντος, ὁ τῶν πατέρων καὶ πάσης ἐξουσίας δυνάστης ἐπιφάνειαν μεγάλην ἐποίησεν, ὥστε πάντας τοὺς κατατολμήσαντας συνελθεῖν, καταπλαγέντας τὴν τοῦ Θεοῦ δύναμιν, εἰς ἔκλυσιν καὶ δειλίαν τραπῆναι.
**25** Ὄφθη γάρ τις ἵππος αὐτοῖς φοβερὸν ἔχων τὸν ἐπιβάτην, καὶ καλλίστη σαγῇ διακεκοσμημένος, φερόμενος δὲ ῥύμην ἔσεισε τῷ Ἡλιοδώρῳ τὰς ἐμπροσθίους ὁπλάς· ὁ δὲ ἐπικαθήμενος ἐφαίνετο χρυσῆν πανοπλίαν ἔχων.
**26** Ἕτεροι δὲ δύο ἐφάνησαν αὐτῷ νεανίαι τῇ ῥώμῃ μὲν ἐκπρεπεῖς, κάλλιστοι δὲ τῇ δόξῃ, διαπρεπεῖς δὲ τῇ περιβολῇ· οἳ καὶ παριστάντες ἐξ ἑκατέρου μέρους, ἔμαστίγουν αὐτὸν ἀδιαλείπτως, πολλὰς ἐπιρίπτοντες αὐτῷ πληγάς. Ἄφνω δὲ πεσόντα πρὸς τὴν γῆν καὶ πολλῷ σκότει περιχυθέντα συναρπάσαντες καὶ εἰς φορεῖον ἐνθέντες, τὸν ἄρτι μετὰ πολλῆς παραδρομῆς καὶ πάσης δορυφορίας εἰς τὸ προειρημένον
**27** γαζοφυλάκιον, ἔφερον ἀβοήθητον ἑαυτῷ τοῖς ὅπλοις αὐτὸν καθεστῶτα, φανερῶς τὴν τοῦ Θεοῦ δυναστείαν ἐπεγνωκότα.
**28** Καὶ ὁ μὲν διὰ τὴν θείαν ἐνέργειαν ἄφωνος καὶ πάσης
**29** ἐστερημένος ἐλπίδος καὶ σωτηρίας ἔριπτο.
**30** Οἱ δὲ τὸν Κύριον εὐλόγουν τὸν παραδοξάζοντα τὸν ἑαυτοῦ τόπον· καὶ τὸ μικρῷ πρότερον δέους καὶ ταραχῆς γέμον ἱερόν, τοῦ παντοκράτορος ἐπιφανέντος Κυρίου, χαρᾶς καὶ εὐφροσύνης ἐπληρώτο.
**31** Ταχὺ δέ τινες τῶν τοῦ Ἡλιοδώρου συνήθων ἤξιουν τὸν Ὀνίαν ἐπικαλέσασθαι τὸν ὕψιστον, καὶ τὸ ζῆν χαρίσασθαι τῷ παντελῶς ἐν ἐσχάτῃ πνοῇ κειμένῳ.
**32** Ὕποπτος δὲ γενόμενος ὁ ἀρχιερεύς, μή ποτε διάληψιν ὁ βασιλεύς σχῇ κακουργίαν τινὰ περὶ τὸν Ἡλιόδωρον ὑπὸ τῶν Ἰουδαίων συντετελέσθαι, προσήγαγε θυσίαν ὑπὲρ τῆς τοῦ ἀν-
**33** δρὸς σωτηρίας. Ποιουμένου δὲ τοῦ ἀρχιερέως τὸν ἱλασμόν, οἱ αὐτοὶ νεανίαι πάλιν ἐφάνησαν τῷ Ἡλιοδώρῳ ἐν ταῖς αὐταῖς ἐ-

#### CHAPTER III.

**20** Even the virgins that were kept close, some did run unto the gates, and others unto the walls, and some did look forth through the windows. And all of them, stretching forth their hands toward heaven, did make their supplication.
**21** And it was pitiable to behold the mingled prostration of the multitude,
**22** and the great apprehension of the high priest, who was in sore agony. Therefore did some call upon the Almighty Lord, that He would preserve in safety the things entrusted unto them that had committed them [to His keeping],
**23** with all security.
**24** But Heliodorus did execute that which had been determined. And when he, with his guard, was already present at the very treasury, the Sovereign Lord of fathers and of all authority did make a great manifestation, so that all those who had dared to come together, being utterly dismayed by the power of God, were turned unto faintness and dread.
**25** For there appeared unto them a horse, having a rider of fearful aspect, and adorned with a most glorious caparison; and bearing down with impetuous charge, it did smite Heliodorus with its forehooves; and he that sat upon it appeared to be clad in full golden armour.
**26** And two other young men appeared unto him, conspicuous in might, and exceedingly fair in glory, and distinguished by their raiment; who also, standing on either side, did scourge him without ceasing, casting many stripes upon him. And suddenly, when he had fallen to the ground and was encompassed by a deep darkness, they took him up and laid him upon a litter, even him who but a little before, with great array and with all his guard, had entered the afore-mentioned
**27** treasury, they carried him forth, helpless in himself, though [yet] in his armour, for he had manifestly acknowledged the mighty power of God.
**28** And he, through the divine operation, lay speechless and deprived of all
**29** hope and salvation.
**30** But they did bless the Lord, who had glorified His own holy place; and the Temple, which but a little before was full of dread and confusion, was now filled with joy and gladness, when the Almighty Lord had manifested Himself.
**31** And straightway did certain of Heliodorus's companions entreat Onias that he would call upon the Most High, and that He would grant life unto him who lay utterly at his last gasp.
**32** But the high priest, becoming apprehensive lest the king should conceive that some mischief had been contrived concerning Heliodorus by the Jews, did offer a sacrifice for the man's
**33** salvation. And when the high priest was making the propitiation, the same young men appeared again to Heliodorus in the same
