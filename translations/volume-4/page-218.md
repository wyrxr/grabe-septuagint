**12** νος. Ἡθλοθέτει γὰρ τότε ἀρετὴ
**13** νῖκος ἐν ἀφθαρσίᾳ ἐν ζωῇ πολυγονίῳ. Ἐλεάζαρ δὲ προηγωνίζετο·
**14** ἡ δὲ μήτηρ τῶν ἑπτὰ παίδων ἐνήθλει· οἱ δὲ ἀδελφοὶ ἠγωνίζοντο· ὁ τύραννος ἀνταγωνίζετο· ὁ δὲ κόσμος καὶ ὁ τῶν ἀν-
**15** θρώπων βίος ἐθεώρει. Θεοσέβεια δὲ ἐνίκα, τοὺς ἐχυτῆς ἀθλητὰς
**16** στεφανοῦσα. Τίνες οὐκ ἐθαύμασαν τοὺς τῆς θείας νομοθεσίας
**17** ἀθλητάς; τίνες οὐκ ἐξεπλάγησαν; Αὐτὸς γέτοι ὁ τύραννος καὶ ἔλῶν τὸ συνέδριον αὑτῶν ἐξεθαύμασαν αὐτῶν τὴν ὑπομονήν.
**18** Δι᾿ ἣν καὶ τῷ θείῳ νῦν παρεστήκασιν θρόνῳ, καὶ τὸν μακάριον βιάσιὸν αἰῶνα.
**19** Καὶ γὰρ φησιν ὁ Μωϋσῆς, καὶ πάντες οἱ ἡγιασμένοι ὑπὸ τὰς χεῖράς σου.
**20** Καὶ οὗτοι σὺν οἱ ἀγαθωθέντες διὰ Θεὸν τετίμηνται οὐ μόνον σὺν ταύτῃ τῇ τιμῇ, ἀλλὰ καὶ τῷ δι᾿ αὑτοὺς
**21** τοῦ ἔθνους ἡμῶν τοὺς πολεμίους μὴ ἐπικρατῆσαι, Καὶ τὸν τύραννον τιμωρηθῆναι, καὶ τὴν πατρίδα καθαρισθῆναι,
**22** Ὥσπερ ἀντὶψυχον γεγονότες τῆς τοῦ ἔθνους ἁμαρτίας, καὶ διὰ τοῦ αἵματος τῶν εὐσεβῶν ἐκείνων, καὶ τοῦ ἱλαστηρίου θανάτου αὑτῶν,
**23** ἡ θεία πρόνοια τὸν Ἰσραὴλ προκακωθέντα διέσωσεν. Πρὸς γὰρ τὴν ἀνδρείαν αὑτῶν τῆς ἀρετῆς,
**24** καὶ τὴν ἐπὶ ταῖς βασάνοις αὑτῶν ὑπομονὴν ὁ τύραννος ἀπιδὼν Ἀντίοχος ἀνεκήρυξεν τοῖς στρατιώταις αὑτοῦ εἰς ὑπόδειγμα τὴν ἐκείνων ὑπομονήν.
**25** Ἔσχεν τε αὑτοὺς γενναίους καὶ ἀνδρείους εἰς πεζομαχίαν καὶ πολιορκίαν
**26** καὶ ἐκπορθήσας ἐνίκησεν πάντας τοὺς πολεμίους.

**1** Ὦ τῶν Ἀβραμιαίων σπερμάτων ἀπόγονοι παῖδες Ἰσραηλῖται,
**2** πείθεσθε τῷ νόμῳ τούτῳ, καὶ πάντα τρόπον εὐσεβεῖτε· γινώσκοντες, ὅτι τῶν παθῶν δεσπότης ἐστὶν ὁ εὐσεβὴς λογισμός·
**3** καὶ οὐ μόνον τῶν ἔνδοθεν, ἀλλὰ καὶ τῶν ἔξωθεν πόνων· ἀνθ᾿ ὧν διὰ τὴν εὐσέβειαν προείμενοι τὰ σώματα τοῖς πόνοις ἐκεῖνοι,
**4** οὐ μόνον ὑπὸ τῶν ἀνθρώπων ἐθαυμάσθησαν, ἀλλὰ καὶ θείας μερίδος κατηξιώθησαν.
**5** Καὶ δι᾿ αὑτοὺς εἰρήνευσεν τὸ ἔθνος, καὶ τὴν εὐνομίαν τὴν ἐπὶ τῆς πατρίδος ἀνανεωσάμενον, ἐκπεπολιόρκηκε τοὺς
**6** πολεμίους. Καὶ ὁ τύραννος Ἀντίοχος καὶ ἐπὶ γῆς τετιμώρηται, καὶ ἀποθανὼν κολάζεται·
**7** ὡς γὰρ οὐδὲν οὐδαμῶς ἴσχυσεν ἀναγκάσαι τοὺς Ἱεροσολυμίτας ἀλλοφυλῆσαι, καὶ τῶν πατρίων ἐθνῶν

**2. A free and highly literary translation:**

**CHAPTER XVII.**
**12** For then did Virtue preside [over the contest], [offering] victory in incorruption, in a life of plenteous progeny.
**13** And Eleazar did contend first;
**14** and the mother of the seven children did strive; and the brethren did contend; the tyrant did contend against them; and the world, and the life of men, did behold.
**15** But Piety did prevail, crowning her own athletes.
**16** Who did not marvel at the athletes of the divine Law? Who were not astounded?
**17** Yea, the tyrant himself, and having his council [with him], they did marvel at their endurance.
**18** For which cause also, they now stand before the divine throne, and [they have attained] the blessed, forcible eternity.
**19** For also, Moses saith, "And all those sanctified are under Thy hands."
**20** And these, with those who have become good through God, have been honored, not only with this honor, but also in that through them
**21** the enemies of our nation did not prevail, and the tyrant was punished, and the homeland purified,
**22** as if they had become a ransom for the sin of the nation; and through the blood of those pious ones, and their propitiatory death,
**23** the divine Providence did save Israel, who had been previously afflicted. For toward their valor of virtue,
**24** and their endurance in the torments, the tyrant Antiochus, looking [upon it], did proclaim to his soldiers their endurance as an example.
**25** And he did make them brave and courageous for infantry battle and siege,
**26** and having utterly destroyed [his foes], he did conquer all his enemies.

**CHAPTER XVIII.**
**1** O ye descendants of the Abrahamic seed, children of Israel,
**2** obey ye this Law, and in every way be pious; knowing that pious reason is master of the passions;
**3** and not only of the internal [passions], but also of the external pains; for which things, because of piety, those [who] gave up their bodies to the pains,
**4** not only were admired by men, but also were deemed worthy of a divine portion.
**5** And because of them, the nation was at peace, and having renewed the good governance in the homeland, it did vanquish its
**6** enemies. And the tyrant Antiochus was punished both on earth, and having died, is [still] punished;
**7** for in no wise was he able to compel the Jerusalemites to become foreign, and to be estranged from the ancestral customs.
