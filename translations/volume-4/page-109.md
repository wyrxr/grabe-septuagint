**ΚΕΦ. Θ΄.**
62 Ἐξεχώρησεν ᾿Ιωνάθαν καὶ Σίμων καὶ οἱ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ εἰς Βαιθβασὶ τὴν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, καὶ ᾠκοδόμησε τὰ καθηρημένα αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐτερέωσεν αὐτήν.
63 Καὶ ἔγνω Βακχίδης καὶ συνήγαγε πᾶν τὸ πλῆθος αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοῖς ἐκ τῆς ᾿Ιουδαίας παρήγγειλε.
64 Καὶ ἐλθὼν παρενέβαλεν ἐπὶ Βαιθβασί, καὶ ἐπολέμησεν αὐτὴν ἡμέρας πολλάς,
65 καὶ ἐποίησε μηχανάς.
66 Καὶ ἀπέλιπεν ᾿Ιωνάθαν Σίμωνα τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ πόλει, καὶ ἐξῆλθεν εἰς τὴν χώραν, καὶ ἦλθεν ἐν ἀριθμῷ.
67 Καὶ ἐπάταξεν ᾿Οδοαρρῆν καὶ τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς Φασιρὼν ἐν τῷ σκηνώματι αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐξῆρξατο τύπτειν καὶ ἀναβαίνειν ἐν ταῖς δυνάμεσι.
68 Καὶ Σίμων καὶ οἱ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἐξῆλθον ἐκ τῆς πόλεως, καὶ ἐνεπύρισαν τὰς μηχανάς.
69 Καὶ ἐπολέμησαν πρὸς τὸν Βακχίδην, καὶ συνετρίβη ὑπ᾿ αὐτῶν,
70 καὶ ἔθλιβον αὐτὸν σφόδρα, ὅτι ἦν ἡ βουλὴ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἡ ἔφοδος αὐτοῦ κενή.
71 Καὶ ὠργίσθησαν θυμῷ τοῖς ἀνδράσι τοῖς ἀνόμοις τοῖς συμβουλεύσασιν αὐτῷ ἐλθεῖν εἰς τὴν χώραν, καὶ ἀπέκτειναν ἐξ αὐτῶν πολλοὺς,
72 καὶ ἐβουλεύσατο τοῦ ἀπελθεῖν εἰς τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ.
73 Καὶ ἐπέγνω ᾿Ιωνάθαν, καὶ ἀπέστειλε πρὸς αὐτὸν πρέσβεις, τοῦ συνθέσθαι πρὸς αὐτὸν εἰρήνην, καὶ ἀποδοῦναι αὐτοῖς τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν.
74 Καὶ ἀπεδέξατο, καὶ ἐποίησε κατὰ τοὺς λόγους αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὤμοσεν αὐτῷ μὴ ἐκζητῆσαι αὐτῷ κακὸν πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς ζωῆς αὐτοῦ.
75 Καὶ ἀπέδωκεν αὐτῷ τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν ἣν ᾐχμαλώτευσε τοπρότερον ἐκ γῆς ᾿Ιούδα·
76 καὶ ἀποστρέψας ἀπῆλθεν εἰς τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐ προσέθετο ἔτι ἐλθεῖν εἰς τὰ ὅρια αὐτῶν.
77 Καὶ κατέπαυσε ῥομφαία ἐξ ᾿Ισραήλ, καὶ ᾤκησεν ᾿Ιωνάθαν ἐν Μαχμάς·
78 καὶ ἤρξατο ᾿Ιωνάθαν κρίνειν τὸν λαὸν, καὶ ἠφάνισε τοὺς ἀσεβεῖς ἐξ ᾿Ισραήλ.

**ΚΕΦ. Ι΄.**
1 ΚΑΙ ἐν ἔτει ἑξηκοστῷ καὶ ἑκατοστῷ ἀνέβη ᾿Αλέξανδρος ὁ τοῦ ᾿Αντιόχου ὁ ᾿Επιφανὴς, καὶ κατελάβετο Πτολεμαΐδα, καὶ ἐπεδέξατο αὐτὸν, καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν ἐκεῖ.
2 Καὶ ἤκουσε Δημήτριος ὁ βασιλεύς, καὶ συνήγαγε δυνάμεις πολλὰς σφόδρα, καὶ ἐξῆλθεν εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτῷ εἰς πόλεμον.
3 Καὶ ἀπέστειλε πρὸς ᾿Ιωνάθαν ἐπιστολὰς Δημήτριος λόγοις εἰρηνικοῖς, ὥστε μεγαλῦναι αὐτόν.
4 Εἶπε γάρ· προφθάσσωμεν τοῦ εἰρήνην θεῖναι μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ,
