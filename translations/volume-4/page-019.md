καὶ ποιήσατε δικαιοσύνην ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ. τίς γιγνώσκει εἰ θε-
7 λήσει ὑμᾶς, καὶ ποιήσει ἐλεημοσύνην εἰς ὑμᾶς; Τὸν Θεόν μου
ὑψῶ, καὶ ἡ ψυχή μου τὸν βασιλέα τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ ἀγαλλιάσεται
8 τὴν μεγαλωσύνην αὐτοῦ. Λεγέτωσαν πάντες, καὶ ἐξομολογείσθω-
9 σαν αὐτῷ ἐν Ἱεροσολύμοις. Ἱεροσόλυμα πόλις ἁγία, μαστιγώσει
ἐπὶ τὰ ἔργα τῶν υἱῶν σου, καὶ πάλιν ἐλεήσει τοὺς υἱοὺς τῶν
10 δικαίων. Ἐξομολογοῦ τῷ Κυρίῳ ἀγαθῶς, καὶ εὐλόγει τὸν βασι-
λέα τῶν αἰώνων, ἵνα πάλιν ἡ σκηνὴ αὐτοῦ οἰκοδομηθῇ ἐν σοὶ
μετὰ χαρᾶς, καὶ εὐφρανθῇ ἐν σοὶ τοὺς ἐκεῖ αἰχμαλώτους, καὶ ἀ-
γαπήσαι ἐν σοὶ τοὺς ταλαιπώρους εἰς πάσας τὰς γενεὰς τοῦ αἰῶ-
11 νος. Ἔθνη πολλὰ μακρόθεν ἥξει πρὸς τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ,
δῶρα ἐν χερσὶν ἔχοντες, δῶρα τῷ βασιλεῖ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, γενεαὶ
12 γενεῶν αἰνέσουσί σοι, καὶ δώσουσιν ἀγαλλίασιν. Ἐπικατάρατοι
πάντες οἱ μισοῦντές σε, εὐλογημένοι ἔσονται πάντες οἱ ἀγαπῶν-
13 τές σε εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα. Χάρηθι καὶ ἀγαλλίασαι ἐπὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς τῶν
δικαίων, ὅτι συναχθήσονται καὶ εὐλογήσουσι τὸν Κύριον τῶν
14 δικαίων. Ὦ μακάριοι οἱ ἀγαπῶντές σε, χαρήσονται ἐπὶ τῇ εἰ-
ρήνῃ σου· μακάριοι ἐσοί ἐλυπήθησαν ἐπὶ πάσαις ταῖς μάστιξί σου,
ὅτι ἐπὶ σοὶ χαρήσονται θεασάμενοι πᾶσαν τὴν δόξαν σου, καὶ
15 εὐφρανθήσονται εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα. Ἡ ψυχή μου εὐλογείτω τὸν Θεὸν
16 τὸν βασιλέα τὸν μέγαν· ὅτι οἰκοδομηθήσεται Ἱερουσαλὴμ σαπ-
φείρῳ καὶ σμαράγδῳ, καὶ λίθῳ ἐπιτίμῳ, τὰ τείχη σου, καὶ οἱ
17 πύργοι, καὶ οἱ προμαχῶνες ἐν χρυσίῳ καθαρῷ, καὶ αἱ πλατεῖαι
Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐν βηρύλλῳ καὶ ἄνθρακι καὶ λίθῳ ἐκ Σουφεὶρ ψη-
18 φολογηθήσονται. Καὶ ἐροῦσι πᾶσαι αἱ ῥύμαι αὐτῆς, Ἀλληλούϊα·
καὶ αἰνέσουσι, λέγοντες· εὐλογητὸς ὁ Θεός, ὃς ὕψωσεν εἰς πάν-
τας τοὺς αἰῶνας.

1.2 ΚΑΙ ἐπαύσατο ἐξομολογούμενος Τωβίτ. Καὶ ἦν ἐτῶν ὀγ-
δονταοκτώ, ὅτε ἀπώλεσε τὰς ὄψεις, καὶ μετὰ ἔτη ὀκτὼ ἀ-
νέβλεψε, καὶ ἐποίει ἐλεημοσύνας, καὶ προσέθετο φοβεῖσθαι Κύ-
3 ριον τὸν Θεόν, καὶ ἐξομολογεῖσθαι αὐτῷ. Μεγάλως δὲ ἐγήρασε,
καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοὺς ἐξ υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπεν
αὐτῷ· τέκνον, λαβὲ τοὺς υἱούς σου, ἰδοὺ γεγήρακα, καὶ πρὸς τὸ

[Tobit 13:16]
for Jerusalem shall be built with sapphire and emerald, and with precious stone; thy walls, and the towers, and the bulwarks [shall be built] with pure gold,

[Tobit 13:17]
and the streets of Jerusalem shall be paved with beryl and carbuncle, and with stones of Ophir.
