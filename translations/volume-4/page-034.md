ΚΕΦ. Ηʹ. ΙΟΥΔΙΘ 1565
κεν αὐτῇ ρῆμα πονηρόν, ὅτι ἐφοβεῖτο τὸν Θεὸν σφόδρα. Καὶ ἤκουσε 9
τὰ ῥήματα τοῦ λαοῦ τὰ πονηρὰ ἐπὶ τὸν ἄρχοντα, ὅτι ὠλιγοψύχησαν ἐπὶ τῇ σπάνει τῶν ὑδάτων. καὶ ἤκουσε πάντας τοὺς
λόγους ᾿Ιουδὶθ οὓς ἐλάλησε πρὸς αὐτοὺς ᾿Οζίας, ὡς ὤμοσεν αὐτοῖς παραδώσειν τὴν πόλιν μετὰ ἡμέρας πέντε τοῖς ᾿Ασσυρίοις.
Καὶ ἀποστείλασα τὴν ἄβραν αὐτῆς τὴν ἐφεστῶσαν πᾶσι τοῖς 10
ὑπάρχουσιν αὐτῆς, ἐκάλεσεν ᾿Οζίαν καὶ Χαβρεὶμ καὶ Χαρμὶν τοὺς
πρεσβυτέρους τῆς πόλεως αὐτῆς· καὶ ἦλθον πρὸς αὐτήν, καὶ εἶπε 11
πρὸς αὐτούς· ἀκούσατε δὴ μου ἄρχοντες τῶν κατοικούντων ἐν
Βαιτυλούᾳ· ὅτι οὐκ εὐθὺς ὁ λόγος ὑμῶν ὃν ἐλαλήσατε ἐναντίον
τοῦ λαοῦ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ταύτῃ, καὶ ἐστήσατε τὸν ὅρκον τοῦτον
ὃν ἐλαλήσατε ἀναμέσον τοῦ Θεοῦ καὶ ὑμῶν, καὶ εἴπατε ἐκδώσειν
τὴν πόλιν τοῖς ἐχθροῖς ἡμῶν, ἐὰν μὴ ἐν αὐταῖς ἐπιστρέψῃ Κύριος βοηθῆσαι ἡμῖν. Καὶ νῦν τίνες ἐστὲ ὑμεῖς οἳ ἐπειράσατε τὸν 12
Θεὸν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ σήμερον, καὶ ἔστασθε ὑπὲρ τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐν μέσῳ υἱῶν ἀνθρώπων; Καὶ νῦν Κύριον παντοκράτορα ἐξετάζετε, 13
καὶ οὐδὲν ἐπιγνώσεσθε ἕως τοῦ αἰῶνος· ὅτι βάθος καρδίας ἀν14
θρώπου οὐχ εὑρήσετε, καὶ λόγους τῆς διανοίας αὐτοῦ οὐ διαλήψεσθε· καὶ πῶς τὸν Θεὸν ὃς ἐποίησε πάντα ταῦτα ἐρευνήσετε,
καὶ τὸν νοῦν αὐτοῦ ἐπιγνώσεσθε, καὶ τὸν λογισμὸν αὐτοῦ κατανοήσετε; μηδαμῶς, ἀδελφοί, μὴ παροργίζετε Κύριον τὸν Θεὸν
ἡμῶν, ὅτι ἐὰν μὴ βούληται ἐν ταῖς πέντε ἡμέραις βοηθῆσαι ἡ15
μῖν, αὐτὸς ἔχει τὴν ἐξουσίαν ἐν αἷς θέλει σκεπάσαι ἡμέραις, ἢ καὶ
ὀλεθρεῦσαι ἡμᾶς πρὸ προσώπου τῶν ἐχθρῶν ἡμῶν. Ὑμεῖς δὲ μὴ 16
ἐνεχυράζετε τὰς βουλὰς Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν, ὅτι οὐχ ὡς
ἄνθρωπος ὁ Θεὸς ἀπειληθῆναι, οὐδὲ ὡς υἱὸς ἀνθρώπου διαιτηθῆναι. Διόπερ ἀναμένοντες τὴν παρ᾿ αὐτοῦ σωτηρίαν, ἐπικαλεσώμε17
θα αὐτὸν εἰς βοήθειαν ἡμῶν, καὶ εἰσακούσεται τῆς φωνῆς ἡμῶν,
ἐὰν ᾖ αὐτῷ ἀρεστόν. Ὅτι οὐκ ἀνέστη ἐν ταῖς γενεαῖς ἡμῶν, οὐδὲ 18
ἐστιν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ σήμερον οὔτε φυλή, οὔτε πατριά, οὔτε δῆμος, οὔτε πόλις ἐξ ἡμῶν, οἳ προσκυνοῦσι θεοῖς χειροποίητοις, καθάπερ ἐγένετο ἐν ταῖς πρότερον ἡμέραις, ὧν χάριν ἐδόθησαν εἰς 19
ῥομφαίαν καὶ εἰς διαρπαγὴν οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν, καὶ ἔπεσον πτῶμα
μέγα ἐνώπιον τῶν ἐχθρῶν ἡμῶν. Ἡμεῖς δὲ ἕτερον Θεὸν οὐκ ἔ20
γνωμεν πλὴν αὐτοῦ· ὅθεν ἐλπίζομεν ὅτι οὐχ ὑπερέψεται ἡμᾶς,
οὐδ᾿ ἀπὸ τοῦ γένους ἡμῶν. Ὅτι ἐν τῷ ληφθῆναι ἡμᾶς, οὕτως

#### CHAPTER 8

9 unto her a wicked word was made void, for she feared God greatly. And she heard the wicked words of the people against the ruler, because they were faint-hearted by reason of the scarcity of waters. And she heard all the words of Judith which Uzziah spoke unto them, how he had sworn unto them that he would deliver the city after five days to the Assyrians.
10 And she sent forth her maidservant, who was set over all her possessions, and called Uzziah, and Chabris, and Charmis, the elders of her city.
11 And they came unto her, and she said unto them: "Hearken unto me now, ye rulers of them that dwell in Bethulia: for not just is your word which ye have spoken before the people this day, and ye have established this oath which ye have sworn between God and yourselves, and have said that ye will deliver the city unto our enemies, unless the Lord turn in these [five] days to help us.
12 And now, who are ye that have tempted God this day, and have taken your stand for God among the sons of men?
13 And now ye scrutinize the Lord Almighty, and ye shall know nothing unto the age;
14 for the depth of the heart of man shall ye not find, and the words of his understanding shall ye not grasp. And how shall ye search out God, who made all these things, and know His mind, and comprehend His reasoning? By no means, brethren, provoke not the Lord our God to wrath,
15 for if He will not to help us in these five days, He Himself hath the power in whatsoever days He willeth to protect [us], or even to destroy us before the face of our enemies.
16 But as for you, hold not in pledge the counsels of the Lord our God, for God is not as man, that He should be threatened, nor as a son of man, that He should be put to arbitration.
17 Wherefore, awaiting the salvation from Him, let us call upon Him for our help, and He will hearken unto our voice, if it be pleasing unto Him.
18 For there hath not arisen in our generations, nor is there this day, neither tribe, nor clan, nor people, nor city from among us, who worship handmade gods, as it was in the former days,
19 on account of which our fathers were given over to the sword and to plunder, and fell a great slaughter before the face of our enemies.
20 But as for us, we have known no other God save Him; wherefore we hope that He will not overlook us, nor [will He overlook us] from our lineage.
21 For when we are taken captive, thus...
