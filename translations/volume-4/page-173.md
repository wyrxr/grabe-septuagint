Θαυμαστὴν δὲ τινὰ καὶ μεγαλοπρεπεστάτην εἶναι τὴν περὶ αὐτὸν
14 ὑπεροχήν. Ἀποκριθέντα δὲ τὸν Ὀνίαν εἰπεῖν· ὁ φιλάδελφος εὔ-
15 τος ἐστὶν ὁ πολλὰ προσευχόμενος περὶ τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ τῆς ἁγίας
πόλεως Ἱερεμίας ὁ τοῦ Θεοῦ προφήτης. Προτείναντα δὲ Ἱερε-
16 μίαν τὴν δεξιὰν παραδοῦναι τῷ Ἰούδα ῥομφαίαν χρυσῆν, διδόντα
δὲ προσφωνῆσαι τάδε. Λάβε τὴν ἁγίαν ῥομφαίαν δῶρον παρὰ
17 τοῦ Θεοῦ, δι᾽ ἧς θραύσεις τοὺς ὑπεναντίους. Παρακληθέντες δὲ
τοῖς Ἰούδου λόγοις πάνυ καλοῖς καὶ δυναμένοις ἐπ᾽ ἀρετὴν πα-
ρορμῆσαι, καὶ ψυχὰς νέων ἐπανορθῶσαι, διέγνωσαν μὴ στρατεύε-
σθαι, γενναίως δὲ ἐμφέρεσθαι, καὶ μετὰ πάσης εὐανδρίας ἐμ-
πλακέντες κρῖναι τὰ πράγματα, διὰ τὸ καὶ τὴν πόλιν καὶ τὰ ἀ-
18 για καὶ τὸ ἱερὸν κινδυνεύειν. Ἦν γὰρ ὁ περὶ γυναικῶν καὶ
τέκνων ἔτι δὲ ἀδελφῶν καὶ συγγενῶν ἐν ἥττονι μέρει κείμενος
αὐτοῖς ἀγών, μέγιστος δὲ καὶ πρῶτος ὁ περὶ τοῦ καθηγιασμέ-
19 νου ναοῦ φόβος. Ἦν δὲ καὶ τοῖς ἐν τῇ πόλει κατειλημμένοις
οὐ πάρεργος ἀγωνία ταρασσομένοις τῆς ἐν ὑπαίθρῳ προσβολῆς.
20 Καὶ πάντων ἤδη προσδοκώντων τὴν ἐσομένην κρίσιν, καὶ ἤδη
προσμιξάντων τῶν πολεμίων, καὶ τῆς στρατιᾶς ἐκταγείσης, καὶ
τῶν θηρίων ἐπὶ μέρος εὔκαιρον ἀποκατασταθέντων, τῆς τε Ἰπ-
21 που κατὰ κέρας τεταγμένης· Συνιδὼν ὁ Μακκαβαῖος τὴν τῶν
πληθῶν παρουσίαν καὶ τῶν ὅπλων τὴν ποικίλην παρασκευήν, τήν
τε τῶν θηρίων (ἐπὶ μέρος εὔκαιρον) ἀγριότητα, ἀνατείνας τὰς χεῖ-
ρας εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν, ἐπεκαλέσατο τὸν τερατοποιὸν Κύριον τὸν κα-
22 τόπτην, γινώσκων ὅτι οὐκ ἔστι δι᾽ ὅπλων ἡ νίκη, καθὼς δὲ ἐὰν
αὐτῷ κριθείη, τοῖς ἀξίοις περιποιεῖται τὴν νίκην. Ἔλεγε δὲ ἐπι-
καλούμενος τόνδε τὸν τρόπον· Σὺ δέσποτα, ἀπέστειλας τὸν ἀγ-
23 γελόν σου ἐπὶ Ἑζεκίου τοῦ βασιλέως τῆς Ἰουδαίας, καὶ ἀνεῖλεν
ἐκ τῆς παρεμβολῆς Σενναχηρείμ εἰς ἑκατὸν ὀγδοηκονταπέντε χι-
24 λιάδας. Καὶ νῦν, δυνάστα τῶν οὐρανῶν, ἀπόστειλον ἄγγελον ἀ-
γαθὸν ἔμπροσθεν ἡμῶν εἰς δέος καὶ τρόμον. Μεγέθει βραχίο-
νός σου καταπλαγείσαν οἱ μετὰ βλασφημίας παραγενόμενοι ἐπὶ
25 τὸν ἅγιόν σου λαόν· καὶ οὗτος μὲν ἐν τούτοις ἔληξεν. Οἱ δὲ
26 περὶ τὸν Νικάνορα μετὰ σαλπίγγων καὶ παιάνων προσῆγον. Οἱ
δὲ περὶ τὸν Ἰούδαν μετὰ ἐπικλήσεως καὶ εὐχῶν συνέμιξαν τοῖς
27 πολεμίοις. Καὶ ταῖς μὲν χερσὶν ἀγωνιζόμενοι, ταῖς δὲ καρδίαις
πρὸς τὸν Θεὸν εὐχόμενοι , κατέστρωσαν οὐδὲν ἧττον μυριάδων

**Chapter 15**

...wondrous and most magnificent preeminence about him.
**14** And Onias, having answered, did say, "This, O Judah, is the lover of his brethren,
**15** who prayeth much for the people and for the holy city, Jeremiah, the prophet of God." And Jeremiah, having stretched forth
**16** his right hand, did deliver unto Judas a golden sword, and as he gave it, he did thus speak unto him, "Take thou this holy sword, a gift from
**17** God, by which thou shalt break in pieces thine adversaries." And they, having been exhorted by the words of Judas, which were exceeding good and powerful to incite to valor, and to rectify the souls of young men, did determine not to remain idle, but to engage gallantly, and with all manfulness to join battle and decide the matter, because both the city and the holy things and the temple were in danger.
**18** For the struggle concerning wives and children, and moreover, brethren and kinsmen, was to them a matter of lesser import; but the greatest and first [fear] was the fear for
**19** the consecrated temple. And to those who were shut up in the city, there was no small agony as they were distressed by the assault in the open country.
**20** And as all were now awaiting the impending judgment, and the enemies were already joining battle, and the army was drawn up, and the beasts placed in a suitable position,
**21** and the cavalry arrayed on the flank: Maccabeus, having perceived the presence of the multitudes and the diverse preparation of their arms, and the ferocity of the beasts (in a suitable position), did stretch forth his hands unto heaven and call upon the Lord, the Worker of wonders,
**22** the Observer [of all], knowing that victory cometh not by arms, but as it may be judged by Him, so doth He bestow victory upon those who are worthy. And he spake, calling upon [God] in this wise: "O Sovereign Lord, Thou didst send Thy
**23** angel in the time of Hezekiah the king of Judea, and he did destroy from the camp of Sennacherib one hundred fourscore and five thousand.
**24** And now, O Sovereign of the heavens, send forth a good angel before us for dread and terror. By the greatness of Thy arm, let those be smitten down, who are come with blasphemy against
**25** Thy holy people." And he indeed ceased with these words. But those who were with
**26** Nicanor did advance with trumpets and paeans. But those who were with Judas, with invocation and prayers, did join battle with the enemies.
**27** And fighting with their hands, and praying unto God with their hearts, they overthrew no fewer than thirty-five thousand men,
