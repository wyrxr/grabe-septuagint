λογισμῷ αὐτοκράτωρ ἐστιν τῶν παθῶν ὁ εὐσεβὴς λογισμός.
Ἀπέδειξα οὖν ὅτι οὐ μόνον τῶν παθῶν ἄνδρες ἐπεκράτησαν,
ἀλλὰ καὶ γυνὴ τῶν μεγίστων βασάνων ὑπεφρόνησεν. Καὶ οὐχ
οὕτως οἱ περὶ τὸν Δανιὴλ λέοντες ἦσαν ἄγριοι, οὐδὲ ἡ κατὰ
τὸν Μισαὴλ ἐκχυομένη κάμινος λαβροτάτῳ πυρί, ὡς ἡ τῆς φι-
λοτεκνίας περιέκαιεν ἐκείνη φύσις, ἐρῶσαν αὐτῆς τοὺς ἑπτὰ
υἱοὺς βασανιζομένους. Ἀλλὰ τῷ λογισμῷ τῆς εὐσεβείας κατέ-
σχε τοσαῦτα καὶ τηλικαῦτα πάθη ἡ μήτης. Καὶ γὰρ τοῦτό ἐστιν
ἐπιλογίσασθαι, ὅτι εἰ δειλέψυχος ἦν ἡ γυνή, καίπερ μήτηρ οὖσα,
ὠλοφύρετο ἂν ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς· καὶ ἴσως ἂν ταῦτα οὕτως εἶπεν· Ὦ
μελέα ἔγωγε, καὶ πολλάκις τρισάλια, ἥτις ἑπτὰ παῖδας τεκοῦσα,
οὐδενὸς μήτηρ γεγένημαι. Ὦ μάταιε ἑπτὰ κυοφορίαι, καὶ ἀνόη-
τοι ἑπτὰ διακύησι, καὶ ἄπρακτοι τιθηνίαι, καὶ ταλαίπωροι γαλα-
κτοτροφίαι. Μάτην ἐφ᾿ ὑμῖν, ὦ παῖδες, πολλὰς ὑπέμεινα ὠδῖνας
καὶ χαλεπωτέρας φροντίδας ἀνατροφῆς. Ὦ τῶν ἐμῶν παίδων,
οἱ μὲν ἄγαμοι, οἱ δὲ γαμήσαντες ἀνέντοοι, οὐκ ἔχομαι ὑμῶν τέ-
κνα, οὐδὲ μάμμη κληθεῖσα μακαριζόμαι. Ὦ ἡ πολύπαις καὶ
καλλίπαις ἐγὼ γυνὴ χήρα καὶ μὴ πολύτεκνος. Οὐδ᾿ ἂν ἀπο-
θάνοι, θάψοντα τὸν υἱὸν ἔξω τινὰ ἀλλὰ τούτῳ τῷ θρήνῳ εὐ-
θένα ὠλοφύρετο ἡ ἱερὰ καὶ θεοσεβὴς μήτηρ· οὐδ᾿ ἵνα μὴ ἀποθά-
νωσιν ἀπέτρεπεν αὐτῶν τινα, οὐδ᾿ ὡς ἀποθνησκόντων ἐλυπήθη.
Ἀλλ᾿ ὥσπερ ἀδαμάντινον ἔχουσα τὸν νοῦν, καὶ εἰς ἀθανασίαν ἀνα-
τίκτουσα τὸν τῶν υἱῶν ἀριθμόν, μᾶλλον ὑπὲρ τῆς εὐσεβείας ἐπὶ
τὸν θάνατον αὐτοὺς προτρέπετο ἱκετεύουσα. Ὦ μήτηρ δι᾿ εὐ-
σεβεῖαν Θεοῦ στρατιῶτι, πρεσβῦτι καὶ γυνὴ διὰ καρτερίαν καὶ
τύραννον ἐνίκησας, καὶ ἔργοις δυνατωτέρα καὶ λόγοις εὑρέθης ἀν-
δρός. Καὶ γὰρ ὅτε συνελήφθης μετὰ τῶν παίδων, εἰστήκεις τὸν
Ἐλεάζαρον ἐξῶστα βασανιζόμενον, καὶ ἔλεγες τοῖς παισὶν ἐν τῇ
Ἑβραΐδι φωνῇ. Ὦ παῖδες, γενναῖος ὁ ἀγὼν ἐφ᾿ ὃν κληθέντες ὑπὲρ
τῆς διαμαρτυρίας τοῦ ἔθνους, ἐνικήσατε προθύμως ὑπὲρ τοῦ
πατρίου νόμου. Καὶ γὰρ αἰσχρὸν τὸν μὲν γέροντα τοῦτον ὑπο-
μείνειν τὰς διὰ τὴν εὐσέβειαν ἀλγηδόνας, ὑμᾶς δὲ τοὺς νεωτέ-
ρους καταπλαγῆναι τὰς βασάνους. Ἀναμνήσθητε, ὅτι διὰ τὸν
Θεὸν τοῦ κόσμου μετελάβετε, καὶ τοῦ βίου ἀπελαύσατε· καὶ διὰ
τοῦτο ὀφείλετε πάντα πόνον ὑπομένειν διὰ τὸν Θεόν. Δι᾿ ὃν
καὶ ὁ πατὴρ ἡμῶν Ἀβραὰμ ἔσπευδεν τὸν ἐλποπάτορα υἱὸν σφα-

### 2. A Free and Highly Literary Translation:

**CHAPTER XVI.**
**2** The pious Reason is therefore sovereign over the passions.
**3** I have shown then that not only have men prevailed over the passions, but also a woman did scorn the greatest torments.
**4** For not so savage were the lions about Daniel, nor did the furnace, spewing forth against Mishael with a most raging fire, burn so fiercely,
**5** as did that nature of maternal love burn round about her, loving her seven tormented sons.
**6** Yet did the mother, by the Reason of piety, hold in check such and so great passions.
**7** For this also is to be considered, that if the woman had been fainthearted, albeit a mother, she would have lamented for herself; and perhaps she would have spoken thus:
**8** “O wretched I, yea, many times thrice-wretched, who, having borne seven children, have become the mother of none!
**9** O vain seven pregnancies, and foolish seven childbirths, and useless nursings, and sorrowful milk-feedings!
**10** In vain, for your sakes, O my children, have I endured many pangs and more grievous cares of rearing!
**11** O my children, some unmarried, and others, having married, [are now] childless; I possess no children from you, nor am I blessed, being called grandmother.
**12** O I, a woman of many and fair children, [am now] a widow and not a mother of many children.
**13** Nor, if I were to die, would anyone outside bury [my] son!”
**14** But not with this lament did the holy and God-fearing mother wail directly;
**15** neither did she turn aside any of them lest they should die, nor was she grieved as [for those] dying.
**16** But as one having a mind of adamant, and giving birth again to the number of her sons unto immortality, she rather urged them toward death for the sake of piety, imploring them, saying:
**17** “O mother, for piety’s sake, a soldier of God, thou aged woman, through endurance hast thou vanquished even the tyrant; and in deeds and in words wert thou found mightier than a man.
**18** For when thou wast arrested with thy children, thou didst stand by Eleazar, the outcast, [as he was] being tormented, and thou didst say to thy children in the Hebrew tongue:
**19** ‘O children, noble is the contest whereunto ye have been called for the testimony of the nation, and ye have willingly conquered for the ancestral Law.
**20** For it is shameful for this old man indeed to endure the pains for piety’s sake, but for you who are younger to be struck down by the torments.
**21** Remember, that for God ye partook of the world, and enjoyed life; and for this reason ye ought to endure every pain for God’s sake.
**22** For whose sake also our father Abraham was eager to slay his hope-fathered son, Isaac;
