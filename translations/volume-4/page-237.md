**ΚΕΦ. Δ´. IV.**
**16** αὐτοῦ κατακρινεῖ δὲ δίκαιος καμὼν τοὺς ζῶντας ἀσεβεῖς,
**17** καὶ νεότης τελεσθεῖσα ταχέως πολυετὲς γῆρας ἀδίκου. Ὄψονται γὰρ τελευτὴν σοφοῦ, καὶ οὐ νοήσουσι τί ἐβουλεύσατο περὶ
**18** αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἰς τί ἠσφαλίσατο αὐτὸν ὁ Κύριος· ὄψονται καὶ ἐξουθενήσουσιν αὐτόν, αὐτοὺς δὲ ὁ Κύριος ἐκγελάσεται.
**19** Καὶ ἔσονται μετὰ τοῦτο εἰς πτῶμα ἄτιμον, καὶ εἰς ὕβριν ἐν νεκροῖς αἰῶνος· ὅτι ῥήξει αὐτοὺς ἀφώνους πρηνεῖς, καὶ σαλεύσει αὐτοὺς ἐκ θεμελίων, καὶ ἕως ἐσχάτων χερσωθήσονται· καὶ ἔσονται ἐν ὀδύνῃ,
**20** καὶ ἡ μνήμη αὐτῶν ἀπολεῖται· ἐλεύσονται ἐν συλλογισμῷ ἁμαρτημάτων αὐτῶν δειλοί, καὶ ἐλέγξει αὐτοὺς ἐξ ἐναντίας τὰ ἀνομήματα αὐτῶν.

**ΚΕΦ. Ε´. V.**

**1** Τότε στήσεται ἐν παῤῥησίᾳ πολλῇ ὁ δίκαιος κατὰ πρόσωπον τῶν θλιψάντων αὐτόν, καὶ τῶν ἀθετούντων τοὺς πόνους αὐτοῦ.
**2** Ἰδόντες δὲ ταραχθήσονται φόβῳ δεινῷ, καὶ
**3** ἐκστήσονται ἐπὶ τῷ παραδόξῳ τῆς σωτηρίας αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐροῦσιν ἐν ἑαυτοῖς μετανοοῦντες, καὶ διὰ στενοχωρίαν πνεύματος στενάζοντες (καὶ ἐροῦσιν)· οὗτος ἦν ἐν ἐσχομένῳ ποτε εἰς
**4** γέλωτα καὶ εἰς παραβολὴν ὀνειδισμοῦ· οἳ ἄφρονες τὸν βίον αὐτοῦ ἐλογισάμεθα μανίαν, καὶ τὴν τελευτὴν αὐτοῦ ἄτιμον·
**5** πῶς κατελογίσθη ἐν υἱοῖς Θεοῦ, καὶ ἐν ἁγίοις ὁ κλῆρος αὐτοῦ ἐστιν;
**6** Ἆρα ἐπλανήθημεν ἀπὸ ὁδοῦ ἀληθείας, καὶ τὸ τῆς δικαιοσύνης φῶς οὐκ ἔλαμψεν (ἐν) ἡμῖν, καὶ ὁ ἥλιος οὐκ ἀνέτειλεν
**7** ἡμῖν. Ἀνομίας ἐνεπλήσθημεν τρίβοις καὶ ἀπωλείας, καὶ ὡδεύσαμεν ἐρήμους ἀβάτους, τὴν δὲ ὁδὸν Κυρίου οὐκ ἔγνωμεν.
**8** Τί ὠφέλησεν ἡμᾶς ἡ ὑπερηφανία; ἢ τί πλοῦτος μετὰ ἀλαζονείας συμβέβληται ἡμῖν;
**9** Παρήλθεν ἐκεῖνα πάντα ὡς σκιά, καὶ ὡς ἀγγελία παρατρέχουσα·
**10** καὶ ὡς ναῦς διερχομένη κυμαινομένον ὕδωρ, ἧς διαβάσης οὐκ ἔστιν ἴχνος εὑρεῖν, οὐδὲ ἀτραπὸν τρόπεως αὐτῆς ἐν κύμασιν,
**11** ἢ ὡς ὀρνέου διαπτάντος ἀέρα οὗ οὐδὲν εὑρίσκεται τεκμήριον πορείας, πληγὴ δὲ παρσῶν μαστιζομένου πνεῦμα κοῦφον καὶ σχιζομένου βίᾳ ῥοίζου, κινουμένων πτερύγων διωδευθῆ,
**12** καὶ μετὰ τοῦτο οὐχ εὑρέθη σημεῖον ἐπιβάσεως ἐν αὐτῷ· ἢ ὡς βέλους βληθέντος ἐπὶ σκοπόν, τμηθεὶς ὁ ἀὴρ εὐθέως εἰς ἑαυτὸν

**CHAPTER IV.**

**16** him. Moreover, the righteous man, though he hath suffered, shall condemn them that are ungodly and yet live,
**17** and youth perfected swiftly, the many-yeared old age of the unrighteous. For they shall behold the end of the wise man, and shall not understand what the Lord hath counselled concerning
**18** him, and unto what end the Lord hath secured him. They shall behold [him] and shall despise him, but the Lord shall utterly mock them.
**19** And after this shall they become a dishonored fall, and a reproach among the dead of eternity; for He shall shatter them, speechless and prostrate, and shall shake them from their very foundations, and unto the uttermost shall they be laid waste; and they shall be in anguish,
**20** and their memory shall perish. They shall come, fearful, in the reckoning of their sins, and their iniquities shall convict them face to face.

**CHAPTER V.**

**1** Then shall the righteous man stand in great boldness before the face of them that afflicted him, and of them that held his labors in contempt.
**2** And they, seeing [him], shall be troubled with dreadful fear, and
**3** shall be utterly astonished at the wondrousness of his salvation. And they shall say within themselves, repenting and groaning through anguish of spirit (yea, they shall say): "This was he whom we once held in derision and for a byword of reproach.
**4** We fools reckoned his life as madness, and his end as dishonorable.
**5** How is it that he is now numbered among the children of God, and among the holy ones is his inheritance?
**6** Verily, we have strayed from the way of truth, and the light of righteousness hath not shone [upon] us, neither hath the sun risen
**7** for us. We were filled with the paths of iniquity and destruction, and we journeyed through untrodden deserts, but the way of the Lord we knew not.
**8** What profit hath our pride availed us? Or what hath the boastfulness of riches brought us?
**9** All those things have passed away as a fleeting shadow, and as a message that runneth swiftly by;
**10** and as a ship that passeth through the surging water, of which, when it hath traversed, no trace can be found, nor a path of its keel in the waves;
**11** or as a bird that hath flown through the air, of which no evidence of its passage is found; but a stroke of [its] pale [members], as it scourged the light air and rent it by the force of a rushing sound, [and thus] the moving wings traversed [it];
**12** and after this no sign of its course was found therein; or as an arrow shot at a target, the air, being cut, straightway returneth unto itself."
