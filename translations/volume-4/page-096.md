**5:67** βουλευτῶς. Καὶ ἐξέκλινεν Ἰούδας εἰς Ἄζωτον γῆν ἀλλοφύλων, καὶ καθεῖλε τοὺς βωμοὺς αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰ γλυπτὰ τῶν θεῶν αὐτῶν κατέκαυσε πυρὶ, καὶ ἐσκύλευσε σκῦλα τῶν πόλεων, καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν εἰς τὴν Ἰουδαίαν.

**ΚΕΦ. Ϛ΄. VI.**

**6:1** ΚΑὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἀντίοχος διεπορεύετο τὰς ἐπάνω χώρας, καὶ ἤκουσεν, ὅτι ἐστὶν Ἐλυμαῖς ἐν τῇ Περσίδι πόλις ἔνδοξος πλούτῳ ἀργυρίῳ καὶ χρυσίῳ.
**6:2** Καὶ τὸ ἐν αὐτῇ πλούσιον σφόδρας, καὶ ἐκεῖ καλύμματα χρυσᾶ, καὶ θώρακες καὶ ὅπλα, ἃ κατέλιπεν ἐκεῖ Ἀλέξανδρος ὁ τοῦ Φιλίππου ὁ βασιλεὺς ὁ Μακεδών, ὃς ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν τοῖς Ἕλλησι πρῶτος.
**6:3** Καὶ ἦλθε καὶ ἐζήτει καταλαβεῖν τὴν πόλιν καὶ προνομεῦσαι αὐτὴν, καὶ οὐκ ἠδυνάσθη, ὅτι ἐγνώσθη ὁ λόγος τοῖς ἐκ τῆς πόλεως.
**6:4** Καὶ ἀνέστησαν αὐτῷ εἰς πόλεμον, καὶ ἔφυγε, καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ἐκεῖθεν μετὰ λύπης μεγάλης ἀποστρέψαι εἰς Βαβυλῶνα.
**6:5** Καὶ ἦλθεν ἀπαγγέλλων τις αὐτῷ εἰς τὴν Περσίδα, ὅτι τετρόπωνται αἱ παρεμβολαὶ αἱ πορευθεῖσαι εἰς γῆν Ἰούδα.
**6:6** Καὶ ἐπορεύθη Λυσίας δυνάμει ἰσχυρᾷ ἐν πρώτοις, καὶ ἀνετράπη ἐπὶ προσώπου αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπίσχυσαν ὅπλοις καὶ δυνάμει καὶ σκύλοις πολλοῖς, οἷς ἔλαβεν ἀπὸ τῶν παρεμβολῶν ὧν ἐξέκοψαν.
**6:7** Καὶ καθεῖλαν τὸ βδέλυγμα, ὃ ᾠκοδόμησεν ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον τὸ ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ, καὶ τὸ ἁγίασμα καθὼς τὸ πρότερον ἐκύκλωσαν τείχεσιν ὑψηλοῖς, καὶ τὴν Βαιθσούρα πόλιν αὐτοῦ.
**6:8** Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἤκουσεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τοὺς λόγους τούτους, ἐθαμβήθη καὶ ἐσαλεύθη σφόδρα· καὶ ἔπεσεν ἐπὶ τὴν κοίτην, καὶ ἐνέπεσεν εἰς ἀρρώστιαν ἀπὸ τῆς λύπης, ὅτι οὐκ ἐγένετο αὐτῷ καθὼς ἐνεθυμεῖτο.
**6:9** Καὶ ἦν ἐκεῖ ἡμέρας πλείους ὅτι ἀνεκαίνισθη ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν λύπη μεγάλη, καὶ ἐλογίσατο ὅτι ἀποθνήσκει.
**6:10** Καὶ ἐκάλεσε πάντας τοὺς φίλους αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτούς· ἀφίσταται ἀπὸ τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν μου ὁ ὕπνος, καὶ συμπέπτωκα τῇ καρδίᾳ ἀπὸ τῆς μερίμνης.
**6:11** Καὶ εἶπα τῇ καρδίᾳ μου· ἕως τίνος θλίψεως ἦλθον καὶ κλύδωνος μεγάλου, ἐν ᾧ νῦν εἰμι ; ὅτι χρηστὸς καὶ ἀγαπώμενος ἤμην ἐν τῇ ἐξουσίᾳ μου.
**6:12** Νῦν δὲ μιμνήσκομαι τῶν κακῶν ὧν ἐποίησα ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἔλαβον πάντα τὰ σκεύη τὰ ἀργυρᾶ καὶ τὰ χρυσᾶ τὰ ἐν αὐτῇ, καὶ ἐξαπέστειλα τοῦ ἐξᾶραι τοὺς κατοικοῦντας Ἰούδα διακενῆς.
**6:13** Ἔγνων οὖν ὅτι χάριν τούτων εὗρόν με τὰ κακὰ

### Chapter 5

**67** ...unadvisedly. And Judas turned aside unto Azotus, the land of the Philistines, and he cast down their altars, and the graven images of their gods did he burn with fire; and he took spoils from the cities, and returned unto the land of Judah.

### Chapter 6

**1** Now King Antiochus journeyed through the upper countries, and he heard that there was in Persia a city named Elymais, glorious in wealth, in silver and in gold.
**2** And that which was therein was exceeding rich; for there were there golden coverings, and breastplates and weapons, which Alexander the son of Philip, the King of Macedon, who reigned first among the Greeks, had left there.
**3** And he came and sought to take the city and to plunder it, but he could not, for the matter became known to those of the city.
**4** And they rose up against him for battle, and he fled, and departed thence with great grief, to return to Babylon.
**5** And there came one bringing tidings unto him in Persia, that the camps which had gone forth into the land of Judah had been put to rout.
**6** And Lysias had gone forth first with a strong force, and had been overthrown before them, and they [the Jews] were strengthened with weapons and with power and with much spoil, which they had taken from the camps which they had cut off.
**7** And they had cast down the abomination which he had built upon the altar in Jerusalem; and the sanctuary they had encircled with high walls, even as it was aforetime; and Beth-zur, his city.
**8** And it came to pass, when the king heard these tidings, he was astonished and greatly shaken; and he fell upon his bed, and became sick from sorrow, because it had not come to pass unto him as he had intended.
**9** And he remained there many days, because great sorrow was renewed upon him, and he reckoned that he was dying.
**10** And he called all his friends, and said unto them, "Sleep departeth from mine eyes, and my heart is collapsed from anxiety.
**11** And I said unto my heart, 'Unto what great tribulation and tempestuous wave have I come, wherein I now am? For I was gracious and beloved in my dominion.
**12** But now I remember the evils which I wrought in Jerusalem, and that I took all the silver and the golden vessels that were therein, and sent forth to destroy those who dwelt in Judah without cause.'
**13** Therefore I know that for these things these evils have found me,"
