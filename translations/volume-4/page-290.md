ΙΗΣΟΥ ΥΙΟΥ ΣΙΡΑΧ
1821
πάσαλος· καὶ ἀναμέσον πράσεως καὶ ἀγορασμοῦ συντριβήσεται ἁμαρτία.
Ἐὰν μὴ ἐν φόβῳ Κυρίου κρατήσῃ κατὰ σπουδήν, ἐν τάχει 3
καταστραφήσεται αὐτοῦ ὁ οἶκος. Ἐν σείσματι κοσκίνου διαμένει 4
κοπρία· οὕτως σκύβαλα ἀνθρώπου ἐν λογισμῷ αὐτοῦ. Σκεύη κερα- 5
μέως δοκιμάσει κάμινος· καὶ πειρασμὸς ἀνθρώπου ἐν λογισμῷ 6
αὐτοῦ. Γεώργιον ξύλου ἐκφαίνει ὁ καρπὸς αὐτοῦ· οὕτως λόγος ἐν- 7
θυμήματος καρδίαν ἀνθρώπου. Πρὸ λογισμοῦ μὴ ἐπαίνει ἄνδρα· 8
οὗτος γὰρ πειρασμὸς ἀνθρώπων. Ἐὰν διώκῃς τὸ δίκαιον, κατα- 9
λήψῃ, καὶ ἐνδύσῃ αὐτὸ ὡς ποδήρη δόξῃ. Πετεινὰ πρὸς τὰ ὅμοια 10
αὐτῶν καταλύσει· καὶ ἀλήθεια πρὸς τοὺς ἐργαζομένους αὐτὴν 11
ἐπανήξει. Λέων θήραν ἐνεδρεύει· οὕτως ἁμαρτία ἐργαζομένους ἀ- 12
δικα. Διήγησις σοφοῦ διαπαντὸς σοφία· ὁ δὲ ἄφρων ὡς σελήνη ἀλ- 13
λοιούται. Εἰς μέσον ἀσυνέτων συντόμησον καιρόν· εἰς μέσον δὲ 14
διανοουμένων ἐνδελέχιζε. Διήγησις μωρῶν (καὶ) προσόχθισμα, καὶ 15
ὁ γέλως αὐτῶν ἐν σπατάλῃ ἁμαρτίας. Λαλιὰ πολυόρκου ἀνορθώ- 16
σει τρίχας, καὶ ἡ μάχη αὐτῶν ἐμφραγμὸς ὠτίων. Ἔκχυσις αἵ- 17
ματος μάχη ὑπερηφάνων, καὶ ἡ διαλοιδορησις αὐτῶν ἀκοὴ μο- 18
χθηρά. Ὁ ἀποκαλύπτων μυστήρια ἀπώλεσε πίστιν, καὶ οὐ μὴ 19
εὕρῃ φίλον πρὸς τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ. Στέρξον φίλον, καὶ πιστώθητι 20
μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ· ἐὰν δὲ ἀποκαλύψῃς τὰ μυστήρια αὐτοῦ, μὴ κατα- 21
διώξῃς ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ. Καθὼς γὰρ ἀπώλεσεν ἄνθρωπος τὸν ἐχθρὸν 22
αὐτοῦ, οὕτως ἀπώλεσας τὴν φιλίαν τοῦ πλησίον. Καὶ ὡς πετεινὸν 23
ἐκ χειρός σου ἀπέλυσας, οὕτως ἀφῆκας τὸν πλησίον, καὶ οὐ θη- 24
ρεύσεις αὐτόν. Μὴ αὐτὸν διώξῃς, ὅτι μακρὰν ἀπέστη, καὶ ἐξέφυγεν 25
ὡς δορκὰς ἐκ παγῖδος. Ὅτι τραῦμά ἐστι καταδῆσαι, καὶ λοιδο- 26
ρίας ἐστὶ διαλλαγή· ὁ δὲ ἀποκαλύψας μυστήρια ἀπήλπισε. Δια- 27
νεύων ὀφθαλμῷ τεκταίνει κακά, καὶ οὐδεὶς αὐτὰ ἀποστήσει ἀπ᾿ 28
αὐτοῦ. Ἀπέναντι τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν σου γλυκανεῖ τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ, 29
καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν λόγων σου ἐκθαυμάσει· Ὕστερον δὲ διαστρέψει τὸ 30
στόμα αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐν τοῖς λόγοις σου δώσει σκάνδαλον· Πολλὰ 31
ἐμίσησα καὶ οὐχ ὡμοίωσα αὐτῷ, καὶ ὁ Κύριος ἐμίσει αὐτόν. Βάλ- 32
λων λίθον εἰς ὕψος, ἐπὶ κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ βάλλει· καὶ πληγὴ δολία 33
διελεῖ τραύματα. Ὁ ὀρύσσων βόθρον εἰς αὐτὸν ἐμπεσεῖται, καὶ 34
ὁ ἱστῶν παγίδα ἐν αὐτῇ ἁλώσεται· ὁ ποιῶν πονηρά, εἰς αὐτὸν κυ- 35
λισθήσεται, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἐπιγνῷ πόθεν ἥκει αὐτῷ. Ἐμπαιγμὸς καὶ 36
ὀνειδισμὸς ὑπερηφάνων. Καὶ ἡ ἐκδίκησις ὡς λέων ἐνεδρεύσει αὐτόν. 29
Παγίδι ἁλώσονται οἱ εὐφραινόμενοι πτώσει εὐσεβῶν, καὶ ὀδύνη 30
καταναλώσει αὐτοὺς πρὸ τοῦ θανάτου αὐτῶν. Μῆνις καὶ ὀργὴ
καὶ ταῦτα ἐστὶ βδελύγματα· καὶ ἀνὴρ ἁμαρτωλὸς ἐγκρατὴς ἔσται
αὐτῶν.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΗ΄. XXVIII.

1 Ὁ ἐκδικῶν παρὰ Κυρίου εὑρήσει ἐκδίκησιν, καὶ τὰς ἁμαρτίας
2 αὐτοῦ διατηρῶν διατηρήσει. Ἄφες ἀδίκημα τῷ πλησίον σου, καὶ
3 τότε δεηθέντος σου αἱ ἁμαρτίαι σου λυθήσονται. Ἄνθρωπος ἀν-
4 θρώπῳ συντηρεῖ ὀργήν, καὶ παρὰ Κυρίου ζητεῖ ἴασιν; Ἐπ᾽ ἀνθρώ-
5 που ὅμοιον αὐτῷ οὐκ ἔχει ἔλεος, καὶ περὶ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν αὐτοῦ
6 δεῖται; Αὐτὸς σὰρξ ὢν διατηρεῖ μῆνιν, τίς ἐξιλάσεται τὰς ἁμαρ-
7 τίας αὐτοῦ; Μνήσθητι τὰ ἔσχατα, καὶ παῦσαι ἐχθραίνων, κατα-
8 φθορὰν καὶ θάνατον, καὶ ἔμεινε ἐντολαῖς. Μνήσθητι ἐντολῶν,
9 καὶ μὴ μηνίσῃς τῷ πλησίον, καὶ διαθήκης ὑψίστου, καὶ πάριδε
10 ἄγνοιαν. Ἀπόσχου ἀπὸ μάχης, καὶ ἐλαττώσεις ἁμαρτίας· ἄνθρω-
11 πος γὰρ θυμώδης ἐκκαύσει μάχην, καὶ ἀνὴρ ἁμαρτωλὸς ταράξει
12 φίλους, καὶ ἀναμέσον εἰρηνευόντων ἐμβαλεῖ διχοβολήν. Κατὰ τὴν
13 ὕλην πυρὸς οὕτως ἐκκαυθήσεται, καὶ κατὰ τὴν στερέωσιν τῆς μά-
14 χης ἐκκαυθήσεται· κατὰ τὴν ἰσχὺν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ὁ θυμὸς αὐτοῦ
15 ἔσται, καὶ κατὰ τὸν πλοῦτον ἀνυψώσει ὀργὴν αὐτοῦ. Ἔρις κατα-
16 σπευδομένη ἐκκαίει πῦρ, καὶ μάχη κατασπεύδουσα ἐκχέει αἷμα.
17 Ἐὰν φυσήσῃς εἰς σπινθῆρα, ἐκκαήσεται, καὶ ἐὰν πτύσῃς εἰς αὐ-
18 τόν, σβεσθήσεται· καὶ ἀμφότερα ἐκ τοῦ στόματός σου ἐκπορεύε-
19 ται. Ψίθυρον καὶ δίγλωσσον καταράσασθε· πολλοὺς γὰρ εἰρηνευόν-
20 τας ἀπώλεσεν. Γλῶσσα τρίτη πολλοὺς ἐσάλευσε, καὶ διέστησεν
21 αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ ἔθνους εἰς ἔθνος, καὶ πόλεις ὀχυρὰς καθεῖλε, καὶ
22 οἰκίας μεγιστάνων κατέστρεψε· γλῶσσα τρίτη γυναῖκας ἀνδρείας
23 ἐξέβαλε, καὶ ἐστέρησεν αὐτὰς τῶν πόνων αὐτῶν· ὁ προσέχων αὐ-
24 τῇ οὐ μὴ εὕρῃ ἀνάπαυσιν, οὐδὲ κατασκηνώσει μεθ᾽ ἡσυχίας. Πλη-
25 γὴ μάστιγος ποιεῖ μώλωπα· πληγὴ δὲ γλώσσης συγκλάσει ὀστᾶ.
26 Πολλοὶ ἔπεσαν ἐν στόματι μαχαίρας, καὶ οὐχ ὡς οἱ πεπτωκότες
27 διὰ γλῶσσαν. Μακάριος ὁ σκεπασθεὶς ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτῆς, ὃς οὐ
28 διῆλθεν ἐν τῷ θυμῷ αὐτῆς, ὃς οὐκ εἵλκυσε τὸν ζυγὸν αὐτῆς, καὶ
29 τοῖς δεσμοῖς αὐτῆς οὐκ ἐδέθη· ὁ γὰρ ζυγὸς αὐτῆς ζυγὸς σιδηροῦς,

**Chapter Twenty-Seven**

2 ...[so] a peg [is fixed]; and amidst selling and buying, sin shall be shattered.
3 If a man doth not hold fast [to his ways] in the fear of the Lord with diligence,
    then swiftly shall his house be destroyed.
4 In the shaking of a sieve, the refuse doth remain;
    so too [are] the dross of a man in his reasoning.
5 The furnace doth prove the potter's vessels;
6 and the trial of a man [is] in his deliberation.
7 The fruit thereof doth reveal the cultivation of a tree;
    so doth the word of a thought [reveal] the heart of a man.
8 Before his reasoning, praise thou not a man;
    for this is the trial of men.
9 If thou pursuest righteousness, thou shalt attain it,
    and shalt array thyself in it as in a glorious priestly garment.
10 Birds shall settle with their own kind;
11 and truth shall return to them that work it.
12 A lion doth lie in wait for prey;
    so doth sin for them that work unrighteousness.
13 The discourse of a wise man is wisdom at all times;
    but the foolish man doth change as the moon.
14 Amongst the senseless, shorten thy time;
    but amongst those who deliberate, tarry long.
15 The discourse of fools (and) an abomination,
    and their laughter [is found] in the riotousness of sin.
16 The speech of him that sweareth much shall make the hair to stand on end,
    and their strife [is] a stopping of the ears.
17 The shedding of blood [is] the battle of the proud,
18 and their reviling [is] a grievous sound.
19 He that revealeth secrets hath lost trust,
    and shall not find a friend for his soul.
20 Love thy friend, and be faithful with him;
21 but if thou revealest his secrets, pursue not after him.
22 For as a man hath lost his enemy,
    so hast thou lost the friendship of thy neighbor;
23 and as a bird released from thy hand,
24 so hast thou let go thy neighbor, and thou shalt not hunt him down.
25 Pursue him not, for he hath gone far away,
    and hath escaped as a gazelle from a snare.
26 For a wound may be bound up, and after reviling there may be reconciliation;
27 but he that hath revealed secrets hath lost all hope [of friendship].
28 He that winketh with his eye doth contrive evil things,
    and no man shall avert them from him;
29 before thine eyes he shall sweeten his mouth,
30 and at thy words he shall marvel;
    but afterward he shall pervert his mouth,
    and in thy words shall he place a stumbling block.
31 Many [vices] have I abhorred, yet I have not become like unto him,
    and the Lord doth hate him.
32 He that casteth a stone upward, upon his own head doth he cast it;
33 and a deceitful blow shall cleave open wounds.
34 He that diggeth a pit shall fall therein,
35 and he that setteth a snare shall be taken therein;
    he that worketh evil shall have it roll back upon him,
    and he shall not know whence it cometh to him.
36 Mockery and reproach [await] the proud;
37 and vengeance, as a lion, shall lie in wait for him.
29 By a snare shall they be caught, who rejoice in the fall of the righteous,
    and anguish shall consume them before their death.
30 Wrath and anger—yea, these are abominations;
    and a sinful man shall be held captive by them.

**Chapter Twenty-Eight**

1 He that seeketh vengeance from the Lord shall find vengeance,
    and [by so doing] his own sins he shall preserve [against himself].
2 Forgive thy neighbor his trespass,
3 and then, when thou makest supplication, thy sins shall be remitted unto thee.
4 Shall a man harbor wrath against another man,
    and yet seek healing from the Lord?
5 Upon a man who is like unto himself he hath no mercy,
    and yet for his own sins doth he make petition?
6 He himself, being but flesh, doth harbor wrath;
    who then shall make expiation for his sins?
7 Remember the last things, and cease to be hostile,
    [considering] corruption and death, and abide by the commandments.
8 Remember the commandments,
9 and be not wroth with thy neighbor;
    and [remember] the covenant of the Most High,
    and overlook [his] ignorance.
10 Abstain from contention, and thou shalt diminish sins;
11 for a man full of wrath shall kindle strife,
    and a sinful man shall trouble his friends,
12 and amongst them that are at peace shall he cast dissension.
13 According to the fuel of fire, so shall it be kindled,
    and according to the strengthening of the strife, so shall it burn forth.
14 According to the strength of a man shall his wrath be,
    and according to his wealth shall he elevate his anger.
15 Contention swiftly kindled doth ignite a fire,
    and battle swiftly hastened doth shed blood.
16 If thou dost blow upon a spark, it shall be kindled,
17 and if thou dost spit upon it, it shall be quenched;
18 and both [these things] do proceed from thy mouth.
19 Curse ye the whisperer and the double-tongued;
20 for many who were at peace hath it destroyed.
    The third tongue hath shaken many, and hath set them apart
21 from nation unto nation, and fortified cities hath it overthrown,
22 and the houses of great men hath it destroyed;
    the third tongue hath cast out courageous women,
23 and hath deprived them of their labors;
    he that giveth heed unto it
24 shall not find rest, neither shall he sojourn with quietness.
25 The stroke of a whip maketh a bruise;
    but the stroke of a tongue shall break bones.
26 Many have fallen by the mouth of the sword,
    yet not as those who have fallen
27 by the tongue.
    Blessed is he that is sheltered from its face, who hath not
28 passed through its wrath, who hath not drawn its yoke,
29 and to its bonds hath not been bound;
    for its yoke is a yoke of iron,
