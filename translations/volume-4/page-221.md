ΒΑΡΟΥΧ.
ΚΕΦ. Α΄. Ι.

12 οὐρανοῦ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς. Καὶ δώσει Κύριος ἰσχὺν ἡμῖν, καὶ φωτίσει
  τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς ἡμῶν, καὶ ζητούμεθα ὑπὸ τὴν σκιὰν Ναβουχοδονόσορ
  βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος, καὶ ὑπὸ τὴν σκιὰν Βαλτάσαρ
  υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ δουλεύσομεν αὐτοῖς ἡμέρας πολλὰς καὶ εὑ-
13 ρήσομεν χάριν ἐναντίον αὐτῶν. Καὶ προσεύξασθε περὶ ἡμῶν πρὸς
  Κύριον Θεὸν ἡμῶν, ὅτι ἡμάρτομεν τῷ Κυρίῳ Θεῷ ἡμῶν, καὶ
  οὐκ ἀπέστρεψεν ὁ θυμὸς Κυρίου καὶ ἡ ὀργὴ αὐτοῦ ἀφ᾿ ἡμῶν, ἕως
14 τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης. Καὶ ἀναγνώσεσθε τὸ βιβλίον τοῦτο, ὃ ἀπεστείλαμεν
  πρὸς ὑμᾶς, ἐξαγορεῦσαι ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου, ἐν ἡμέραις ἑορτῆς,
15 καὶ ἐν ἡμέραις καιροῦ, καὶ ἐρεῖτε· τῷ Κυρίῳ Θεῷ ἡμῶν ἡ
  δικαιοσύνη, ἡμῖν δὲ ἡ αἰσχύνη τῶν προσώπων ὡς ἡ ἡμέρα αὕτη,
16 ἀνθρώπῳ Ἰούδα, καὶ τοῖς κατοικοῦσιν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν
  ἡμῶν, καὶ τοῖς ἄρχουσιν ἡμῶν, καὶ τοῖς ἱερεῦσιν ἡμῶν,
17 καὶ τοῖς προφήταις ἡμῶν, καὶ τοῖς πατράσιν ἡμῶν, ὧν ἡμάρτομεν
  ἐναντίον Κυρίου, καὶ ἠπειθήσαμεν αὐτῷ, καὶ οὐκ ἠκούσαμεν
18 τῆς φωνῆς Κυρίου Θεοῦ ἡμῶν, πορεύεσθαι ἐν τοῖς προστάγμασι
  Κυρίου, οἷς ἔδωκε κατὰ πρόσωπον ἡμῶν, ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέρας
19 ἧς ἐξήγαγε Κύριος τοὺς πατέρας ἡμῶν ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, καὶ
  ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης ἤμεθα ἀπειθοῦντες πρὸς Κύριον Θεὸν
  ἡμῶν, καὶ ἐσχεδιάσαμεν πρὸς τὸ μὴ ἀκούειν τῆς φωνῆς αὐτοῦ.
20 Καὶ ἐκολλήθη εἰς ἡμᾶς τὰ κακά, καὶ ἡ ἀρὰ ἣν συνέταξε Κύριος
  τῷ Μωϋσῇ παιδὶ αὐτοῦ, ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ᾗ ἐξήγαγε τοὺς πατέρας ἡμῶν
  ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, δοῦναι ἡμῖν γῆν ῥέουσαν γάλα καὶ μέλι, ὡς
21 ἡ ἡμέρα αὕτη. Καὶ οὐκ ἠκούσαμεν τῆς φωνῆς Κυρίου Θεοῦ ἡμῶν,
  κατὰ πάντας τοὺς λόγους τῶν προφητῶν, οὓς ἀπέστειλε πρὸς
22 ἡμᾶς. Καὶ ᾠχόμεθα ἕκαστος ἐν διανοίᾳ καρδίας ἡμῶν τῆς πονηρᾶς
  ἐργάζεσθαι θεοῖς ἑτέροις, ποιῆσαι τὰ κακὰ κατ᾿ ὀφθαλμοὺς
  Κυρίου Θεοῦ ἡμῶν.
ΚΕΦ. Β΄. ΙΙ.
1 ΚΑΙ ἔστησεν Κύριος τὸν λόγον αὐτοῦ, ὃν ἐλάλησεν ἐφ᾿ ἡμᾶς,
  καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς δικαστὰς ἡμῶν, τοὺς δικάσαντας τὸν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ
  ἐπὶ τοὺς βασιλεῖς ἡμῶν, καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς ἄρχοντας ἡμῶν, καὶ ἐπὶ ἀνθρώπους
2 Ἰσραὴλ καὶ Ἰούδα, τοῦ ἀγαγεῖν ἐφ᾿ ἡμᾶς κακὰ μεγάλα, ἃ
  οὐκ ἐποιήθη ὑποκάτω παντὸς τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καθὰ ἐποιήθη ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ,
3 κατὰ τὰ γεγραμμένα ἐν τῷ νόμῳ Μωϋσῇ, τοῦ φαγεῖν

**CHAPTER I.**

**12** ...heaven upon the earth. And the Lord shall give us strength, and shall enlighten our eyes, and we shall be kept under the shadow of Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, and under the shadow of Belshazzar his son, and we shall serve them many days, and shall find
**13** favour in their sight. And pray ye for us unto the Lord our God; for we have sinned against the Lord our God, and the wrath of the Lord and His fierce anger is not turned away from us, even unto this day.
**14** And ye shall read this book, which we have sent unto you, to make confession in the house of the Lord, in the days of the feast,
**15** and in the days of [an] appointed time; and ye shall say: To the Lord our God belongeth righteousness, but unto us the shame of faces, as at this day,
**16** [unto] the men of Judah, and [unto] the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and [unto] our kings, and [unto] our princes, and [unto] our priests,
**17** and [unto] our prophets, and [unto] our fathers, for we have sinned before the Lord; and we have been disobedient unto Him, and have not hearkened
**18** unto the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in the commandments of the Lord, which He gave us before our face, from the day
**19** that the Lord brought our fathers out of the land of Egypt, even unto this day have we been disobedient unto the Lord our God, and have purposed not to hearken unto His voice.
**20** And the evils clave unto us, and the curse which the Lord appointed unto Moses His servant, in the day when He brought our fathers out of the land of Egypt, to give us a land flowing with milk and honey, even as
**21** this day. And we have not hearkened unto the voice of the Lord our God, according to all the words of the prophets whom He sent unto
**22** us. And each one of us walked in the evil imagination of our heart, to serve other gods, and to do wickedness in the sight of the Lord our God.

**CHAPTER II.**

**1** And the Lord hath performed His word, which He spake concerning us, and concerning our judges that judged Israel, and concerning our kings, and concerning our princes, and concerning the men of
**2** Israel and Judah, to bring upon us great evils, such as have not been wrought under the whole heaven, even as it was done in Jerusalem,
**3** according to that which is written in the law of Moses, that [a man should] eat...
