γόντες, τὸν ἅγιον ὕμνουν Θεὸν αὐτῶν· καὶ πάλιν ἠξίουν τὸν εὐ-
κατάλλακτον, δεῖξαι μεγαλοσθενῶς ἑαυτοῦ χειρὸς κράτος ἔθνεσιν
14 ὑπερηφανίαν. Μεσοῦσης δὲ ἤδη δεκάτης ὥρας σχεδόν, ὁ
πρὸς ταῖς κλήσεσι τεταγμένος, ἀθρόους τοὺς κλητοὺς ἰδὼν, ἔνυξε
15 προσελθὼν τὸν βασιλέα. Καὶ μόλις διεγείρας, ὑπέδειξε τὸν
τῆς συμποσίας καιρὸν ἤδη παρατρέχοντα, τὸν περὶ τούτων λόγον
16 ποιούμενος. Ὁν δ᾽ ὁ βασιλεὺς λογισάμενος, καὶ τραπεὶς εἰς
τὸν πότον, ἐκέλευσε τοὺς παραγεγονότας εἰς τὴν συμποσίαν ἀν-
17 τικρυς ἀνακλιθῆναι αὐτοῦ. Οὗ καὶ γενομένου, παρήνει εἰς εὐω-
χίαν δόντας ἑαυτοὺς, τὸ παρὸν τῆς συμποσίας ἐπιπολὺ γεραί-
18 ρομένους εἰς εὐφροσύνην καταθέσθαι μέρος. Ἐπιπλέον δὲ προ-
κοπτούσης τῆς ὁμιλίας, τὸν Ἕρμωνα μεταπεμψάμενος ὁ βασιλεὺς,
μετὰ πικρᾶς ἀπειλῆς ἐπυνθάνετο, τίνος ἕνεκεν αἰτίας εἰάθησαν
19 οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι τὴν παροῦσαν ἡμέραν περιβεβιωκότες; Τοῦ δὲ ὑπο-
δείξαντος (ἔτι) νυκτὸς τὸ προσταγὲν ἐπὶ τέλος ἠγκοχηκέναι, καὶ
20 τῶν φίλων αὐτῷ προσαρτυρησάντων· τὴν ὠμότητα χείρονα
Φαλάριδος ἐσχηκὼς ἔφη, τῷ τῆς σήμερον ὕπνῳ χάριν ἔχειν αὐ-
21 τούς· ἀνυπερθέτως δὲ εἰς τὴν ἐπιτελλοῦσαν ἡμέραν κατὰ τὸ ὅμοιον
ἑτοιμασάτω τοὺς ἐλέφαντας ἐπὶ τὸν τῶν ἀθεμίτων Ἰουδαίων ἀφανι-
22 σμόν. Εἰπόντος δὲ τοῦ βασιλέως, ἀσμένως πάντες μετὰ χαρᾶς
οἱ παρόντες ὁμοῦ συναινέσαντες, εἰς τὸν ἴδιον οἶκον ἕκαστος ἀνέ-
23 λυσιν. Καὶ οὐχ οὕτως εἰς ὕπνον κατεχρήσαντο τὸν χρόνον τῆς
νυκτὸς, ὡς εἰς τὸ παντοίους μηχανᾶσθαι τοῖς ταλαιπώροις δο-
24 κοῦσιν ἐμπαιγμούς. Ἄρτι δὲ ἀλεκτρυὼν ἐκέκραγεν ὄρθριος, καὶ
τὰ θηρία καθωπλικὼς ὁ Ἕρμων ἐν τῷ μεγάλῳ περιστύλῳ διε-
25 κίνει. Τὰ δὲ κατὰ τὴν πόλιν πλήθη συνήθροιστο πρὸς τὴν οἰκτρο-
τάτην θεωρίαν, προσδοκῶντα τὴν πρωίαν μετὰ σπουδῆς. Οἱ δὲ
Ἰουδαῖοι κατὰ τὸν ἀμερῆ ψυχουλκούμενοι χρόνον, πολυδάκρυν
ἱκετείαν ἐν μέλεσι γοεροῖς τείνοντες τὰς χεῖρας εἰς τὸν οὐρα-
νὸν ἐδέοντο τοῦ μεγίστου Θεοῦ, πάλιν αὐτοῖς βοηθῆσαι συντόμως.
26 Οὔπω δὲ ἡλίου βολαι κατεσπείροντο, καὶ τοῦ βασιλέως τοὺς φί-
λους ἐκδεχομένου, ὁ Ἕρμων παραστὰς, ἐκάλει πρὸς τὴν
27 ἔξοδον, ὑποδεικνὺς τὸ πρόθυμον τοῦ βασιλέως ἐν ἑτοίμῳ κεῖσθαι.
Τοῦ δὲ ἀποδεξαμένου καὶ καταπλαγέντος ἐπὶ τῇ ἀνόμῳ ἐξόδῳ,
κατὰ πάντα ἀγνωσία κεκρατημένος ἐπυνθάνετο, τί τὸ πρᾶγμα
28 ἐφ᾿ οὗ τοῦτο αὐτῷ κατὰ σπουδῆς τετέλεσται. Τοῦτο δὲ ἦν ἐνέργεια

**III Maccabees, Chapter 5**

**13** and again they implored the [Easily] Appeased One, to show mightily the power of His hand to the insolent nations.
**14** Now when it was almost the tenth hour, he that was appointed for the summonses, having seen the summoned ones gathered together,
**15** drew near and roused the king. And having with difficulty awakened him, he showed that the time for the banquet was already passing, making mention of these matters.
**16** And the king, having considered this, and having turned to the drinking, commanded those who had come to the banquet
**17** opposite him to recline. And when this was done, he exhorted them, giving themselves over to feasting, and greatly honoring the present banquet, to set aside a portion thereof for merriment.
**18** Moreover, as the conversation progressed, the king, having sent for Hermon, inquired with bitter threats, for what reason were the Jews permitted
**19** to have lived through this present day? And when he [Hermon] showed that [he] had brought the command to its completion during the night, and
**20** when his friends also bore witness to him, he [the king] said, having displayed a cruelty worse than that of Phalaris, that they [the Jews] owed gratitude to this day's sleep,
**21** but without delay, on the morrow, let him in like manner prepare the elephants for the destruction of the lawless Jews.
**22** And when the king had spoken, all those present, gladly and with joy, having assented together, each one departed to his own house.
**23** And they did not so much make use of the time of the night for sleep, as for devising all manner of mockings for those wretched ones, as they supposed.
**24** But as the cock had just crowed at dawn, Hermon, having armed the beasts, was moving them in the great colonnade.
**25** And the multitudes throughout the city had gathered for the most piteous spectacle, awaiting the morning with eagerness. But the Jews, being drawn out in spirit through the undivided time, with a tearful supplication, stretching forth their hands to heaven in mournful songs, implored the Most Great God, that He would again quickly help them.
**26** And before the rays of the sun were yet scattered abroad, and as the king was awaiting his friends, Hermon, having stood by, called [him] forth to the exit, indicating that the king's eagerness was ready.
**27** And he [the king], having accepted [this] and being astonished at the unlawful departure, being held by utter ignorance in all things, inquired, saying, "What is this matter
**28** for which this has been carried out for him with such haste?" Now this was the operation
