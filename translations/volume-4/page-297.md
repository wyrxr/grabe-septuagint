12 σοί. Μὴ δωροκόπει, οὐ γὰρ προσδέξεται, καὶ μὴ ἔπεχε θυσία
13 ἀδίκῳ· ὅτι Κύριος κριτής ἐστι, καὶ οὐκ ἔστι παρ᾿ αὐτῷ δόξα προ-
14 σώπου. Οὐ λήψεται πρόσωπον ἐπὶ πτωχοῦ, καὶ δέησιν ἠδικημέ-
15 νου εἰσακούσεται· οὐ μὴ παρίδῃ ἱκετείαν ὀρφανοῦ, καὶ χήραν ἐὰν
16 ἐκχέῃ λαλιάν. Οὐχὶ δάκρυα χήρας ἐπὶ σιαγόνι καταβαίνει, καὶ
17 ἡ καταβόησις ἐπὶ τῷ καταγαγόντι αὐτά; Θεραπεύων ἐν εὐδοκία
18 δεχθήσεται, καὶ ἡ δέησις αὐτοῦ ἕως νεφελῶν συνάψει· προσευχὴ
19 ταπεινοῦ νεφέλας διῆλθε, καὶ ἕως συνεγγίσῃ, οὐ μὴ παρακληθῇ,
20 καὶ οὐ μὴ ἀποστῇ ἕως ἐπισκέψηται Κύριος, καὶ κρινεῖ δικαίοις,
21 καὶ ποιήσει κρίσιν. Καὶ ὁ Κύριος οὐ μὴ βραδύνῃ, οὐδὲ μὴ μακρο-
22 θυμήσῃ ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῖς κραταιός· ἕως ἂν συντρίψῃ ὀσφῦν ἀνελεημόνων,
23 καὶ τοῖς ἔθνεσιν ἀνταποδώσει ἐκδίκησιν· ἕως ἐξάρῃ πλῆθος ὑβρι-
24 στῶν, καὶ σκῆπτρα ἀδίκων συντρίψῃ· ἕως ἀνταποδῷ ἀνθρώπῳ
25 κατὰ τὰς πράξεις αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰ ἔργα τῶν ἀνθρώπων καὶ τὰ ἐνθυ-
26 μήματα αὐτῶν· ἕως κρινῇ τὴν κρίσιν τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ εὐφρα-
27 νεῖ αὐτοὺς ἐν τῷ ἐλέει αὐτοῦ. Ὡραῖον ἔλεος ἐν καιρῷ θλίψεως
28 (αὐτοῦ), ὡς νεφέλαι ὑετοῦ ἐν καιρῷ ἀβροχίας.

**ΚΕΦ. ΛΓʹ. XXXIII.**

 1 ἙΛΕΗΣΟΝ ἡμᾶς δέσποτα ὁ Θεὸς πάντων, καὶ ἐπίβλεψον,
 2 καὶ ἐπίβαλε τὸν φόβον σου ἐπὶ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη τὰ μὴ ἐκζητοῦν-
 3 τά σε· ἔπαρον τὴν χεῖρά σου ἐπὶ ἔθνη ἀλλότρια, καὶ ἰδέτωσαν τὴν
 4 δυναστείαν σου. Ὥσπερ ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν ἡγιάσθης ἐν ἡμῖν, οὕτως ἐνώ-
 5 πιον ἡμῶν μεγαλυνθείης ἐν αὐτοῖς· καὶ ἐπιγνώτωσάν σε, καθάπερ
 6 καὶ ἡμεῖς ἐπέγνωμέν σε, ὅτι οὐκ ἔστι Θεὸς πλὴν σου Κύριε. Ἐγκαί-
 7 νισον σημεῖα, καὶ ἀλλοίωσον θαυμάσια· δόξασον χεῖρα καὶ βρα-
 8 χίονα δεξιόν, ὅπως διηγῶνται τὰ θαυμάσιά σου. Ἔγειρον θυμόν,
 9 καὶ ἔκχεον ὀργήν· ἔξαρον ἀντίδικον, καὶ ἔκτριψον ἐχθρόν. Σπεῦ-
10 σον καιρόν, καὶ μνήσθητι ἐρκισμοῦ, καὶ ἐκδιγησάσθωσαν τὰ με-
11 γαλεῖά σου. Ἐν ὀργῇ πυρὸς καταβρωθήτω ὁ σωζόμενος, καὶ οἱ
12 κακοῦντες τὸν λαόν σου εὕροισαν ἀπώλειαν. Σύντριψον κεφαλὰς ἀρ-
13 χόντων ἐθνῶν, λεγόντων· οὐκ ἔστι πλὴν ἡμῶν. Συνάγαγε πάσας
14 φυλὰς Ἰακώβ.

**Chapter Thirty-Two**

12 to thee. Bribe not, for He shall not accept;
    neither put thy trust in a sacrifice of injustice.
13 For the Lord is a Judge,
    and there is with Him no respect of persons.
14 He shall not show partiality unto the poor,
    and the supplication of him that hath been wronged shall He hear.
15 He shall not overlook the plea of the orphan,
    nor a widow if she pour forth her complaint.
16 Do not the tears of a widow fall upon her cheek?
    and her lamentation ascend against him who caused them to fall?
17 He that worshippeth with good pleasure shall be accepted,
    and his petition shall reach unto the clouds.
18 The prayer of the humble hath passed through the clouds,
    and until it draw nigh, it shall not be turned back,
19 neither shall it depart until the Lord visit [it],
    and judge for the righteous, and execute judgment.
20 And the Lord shall not tarry,
    neither shall He be long-suffering with them, being mighty,
21 until He crush the loins of the merciless,
    and repay vengeance to the nations;
22 until He take away the multitude of the insolent,
    and break the scepters of the unrighteous;
23 until He repay to man according to his deeds,
    and the works of men and their thoughts;
24 until He judge the judgment of His people,
    and make them joyful in His mercy.
25 Beautiful is mercy in the time of tribulation (thereof),
    as clouds of rain in the time of drought.

**Chapter Thirty-Three**

1 HAVE mercy upon us, O Master, the God of all, and look upon [us],
2 and cast Thy fear upon all the nations that seek Thee not.
3 Lift up Thy hand upon foreign nations,
    and let them see Thy power.
4 As Thou wast sanctified in us before them,
    so before us mayest Thou be magnified among them;
5 and let them know Thee, even as we also have known Thee,
    that there is no God save Thee, O Lord.
6 Renew signs, and transform wonders;
    glorify the hand and the right arm,
7 that they may recount Thy marvelous deeds.
8 Arouse wrath, and pour out indignation;
    remove the adversary, and destroy the enemy.
9 Hasten the time, and remember [Thy] oath,
    and let them recount Thy great deeds.
10 In the wrath of fire let him that is being kept be consumed,
    and let those that trouble Thy people find perdition.
11 Crush the heads of the rulers of the nations,
    who say, "There is none save us."
12 Gather together all the tribes of Jacob.
