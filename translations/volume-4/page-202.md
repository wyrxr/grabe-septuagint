ΚΕΦ. Δʹ. ΜΑΚΚΑΒΑΙΩΝ Δʹ. 1733
τες, τὰ δὲ ἐν θαυμασμῷ τῆς καρτερίας προσιόντες αὐτῷ τινὲς 14
τῶν τοῦ βασιλέως ἔλεγον. Τί τοῖς κακοῖς τούτοις σεαυτὸν ἀλο-
γίστως παραβάλλεις, Ἐλεάζαρε; Ἡμεῖς μέντοι τῶν ἡγημένων 15
σοι βρωμάτων παραθήσομεν· σὺ δ᾽ ἐπικρινόμενος τῶν θείων ἀ-
πογεύσασθαι, σώθητι. Καὶ ὁ Ἐλεάζαρος, ὥσπερ πικρότερον διὰ 16
τῆς συμβουλίας αἰκισθείς, ἀνεβόησε. Μὴ οὕτως κακῶς φρονή- 17
σκαιμεν οἱ Ἀβραὰμ παῖδες, ὥστε μαλακοψυχήσαντας ἀπρεπὲς
ἡμῖν δράμα ὑποκρίνασθαι. Καὶ γὰρ ἀλόγιστον, εἰ πρὸς ἀλήθειαν 18
ζήσαντες τὸν μέχρι γήρως βίον, καὶ τὴν ἐπ᾽ αὐτῷ δόξαν νομί-
μως φυλάξαντες, νῦν μεταβαλίμεθα, καὶ αὐτοὶ μὲν ἡμεῖς γε- 19
νοίμεθα τοῖς νέοις ἀσεβείας τύπος. ἵνα παράδειγμα γενώμεθα
τῆς μιαροφαγίας. Αἰσχρὸν γὰρ εἰ ἐπιβιώσωμεν ὀλίγον χρόνον, 20
καὶ τοῦτον καταγελώμενοι πρὸς ἀπάντων ἐπὶ δειλίᾳ· καὶ ὑπὸ 21
μὲν τοῦ τυράννου καταφρονηθῶμεν ὡς ἀνανδροι, τὸν δὲ θεῖον
ἡμῶν νόμον μέχρι θανάτου μὴ προσαπώμεθα. Πρὸς ταῦτα 22
ὑμεῖς μὲν ὦ Ἀβραὰμ παῖδες, εὐγενῶς ὑπὲρ τῆς εὐσεβείας τελευ-
τᾶτε. Οἱ δὲ τοῦ τυράννου δορυφόροι, τί μέλλετε; Πρὸς τὰς 23. 24
ἀνάγκας οὕτως μεγαλοφρονοῦντα αὐτὸν ἰδόντες, καὶ μηδὲ πρὸς
τὸν οἰκτιρμὸν αὐτῶν μεταβαλλόμενον, ἐπὶ τὸ πῦρ αὐτὸν ἤγα-
γον. Ἔνθα διὰ κακοτέχνων ὀργάνων καταψήγοντες αὐτὸν ὑπεξίπτον, 25
καὶ δυσώδεις χυλοὺς εἰς τοὺς μυκτῆρας αὐτοῦ κατέ-
χεον. Ὁ δὲ μέχρι τῶν ὀστέων ἤδη κατακεκαυμένος καὶ μέλ- 26
λων λιποθυμεῖν, ἀνέτεινε τὰ ἔμματα πρὸς τὸν Θεόν, καὶ εἶπεν·
Σὺ οἶδας, Θεέ, παρόν μοι σώζεσθαι, βασάνοις καυστικαῖς ἀποθνή- 27
σκω διὰ τὸν νόμον. Ἵλεως γενοῦ τῷ ἔθει σου, ἀρ- 28
κεσθεὶς τῇ ἡμετέρᾳ ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν δίκῃ. Καθάρισον αὐτῶν, ποίη- 29
σον τὸ ἐμὸν αἷμα, καὶ ἀντίψυχον αὐτῶν λαβὲ τὴν ἐμὴν ψυχήν.
Καὶ ταῦτα εἰπὼν ὁ ἱερὸς ἀνὴρ εὐγενῶς ταῖς βασάνοις ἐναπέθα- 30
νε, καὶ μέχρι τῶν τοῦ θανάτου βασάνων ἀντέστη τῷ λογισμῷ 31
διὰ τὸν νόμον. Ὁμολογουμένως οὖν δεσπότης ἐστὶ τῶν παθῶν
ὁ εὐσεβὴς λογισμός. Εἰ γὰρ τὰ πάθη τοῦ λογισμοῦ ἐκεκρατήκει, 32
τούτοις ἂν ἀπεδόμην τὴν τῆς ἐπικρατείας μαρτυρίαν. Νυνὶ 33
δὲ τοῦ λογισμοῦ τὰ πάθη νικήσαντος, αὐτῷ προσηκόντως τὴν
τῆς ἡγεμονίας προσνέμομεν ἐξουσίαν. Καὶ δίκαιον ἐστιν ὁμολο- 34
γεῖν ἡμᾶς τὸ κράτος εἶναι τοῦ λογισμοῦ, ὅπου γε καὶ τῶν ἔξω-
θεν ἀλγηδόνων ἐπικρατεῖ. Ἐπεὶ καὶ γελοῖον· καὶ οὐ μόνον τῶν 35

**CHAPTER VII.**

1 ὭΣΠΕΡ καὶ ἄριστος κυβερνήτης ὁ τοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν Ἐλεά-
ζαρου λογισμός, πηδαλιουχῶν τὴν τῆς εὐσεβείας ναῦν ἐν τῷ τῶν
2 παθῶν πελάγει, καὶ καταικιζόμενος ταῖς τοῦ τυράννου ἀπειλαῖς
3 καὶ καταντλούμενος ταῖς τῶν βασάνων τρικυμίαις, κατ᾽ οὐδένα
τρόπον μετέτρεφε τοὺς τῆς εὐσεβείας οἴακας, ἕως οὗ ἔπλευσεν
4 ἐπὶ τὸν τῆς ἀθανάτου νίκης λιμένα. Οὐχ οὕτως πόλις πολλοῖς
καὶ ποικίλοις μηχανήμασιν ἀντέσχεν ποτὲ πολιορκουμένη, ὡς ὁ
πανάγιος Ἐλεάζαρος τὴν ἱερὰν ψυχὴν αἰκισμοῖς τε καὶ στρέβλαις
πυρπολούμενος, ἐκίνησε τοὺς πολιορκοῦντας, διὰ τὸν ὑπερασπί-
5 ζοντα τῆς εὐσεβείας λογισμόν. Ὥσπερ γὰρ πρόκρημνον ἄκραν,
τὴν ἑαυτοῦ διάνοιαν ὁ πατὴρ Ἐλεάζαρος ἐκτείνας, περιέκλασεν
6 τοὺς μαινομένους τῶν παθῶν κλύδωνας. Ὦ ἄξιε τῆς ἱερωσύνης ἱερεῦ, οὐκ ἐμίγας τοὺς ἱεροὺς ὀδόντας, οὐδὲ τὴν θεοσέβειαν
καὶ καθαρισμὸν νόμιμον χωρήσασαν γαστέρα ἐκοινώνησας μιαρο-
7. 8 φαγίᾳ. Ὦ σύμφωνε νόμου, καὶ φιλόσοφε θείου βίου. Τοιού-
τους δὴ δεῖ εἶναι τοὺς ἱερουργοῦντας τὸν νόμον ἰδίῳ αἵματι, καὶ
9 γενναίῳ ἱδρῶτι τοῖς μέχρι θανάτου πάθεσιν ὑπερασπίζοντας. Σὺ
πάτερ, τὴν εὐνομίαν ἡμῶν διὰ τῶν ὑπομονῶν εἰς δόξαν ἐκύρωσας,
καὶ τὴν ἁγίαν σεμνολογήσας οὐ κατέλυσας, καὶ διὰ τῶν ἔρ-
10 γων ἐπισημοποίησας τοὺς τῆς θείας φιλοσοφίας λόγους. Ὦ βασά-
νων βιαιότερε γέρων, καὶ πυρὸς εὐτονώτερε πρεσβῦτα, καὶ πα-
11 θῶν μέγιστε βασιλεῦ Ἐλεάζαρε. Ὥσπερ γὰρ ὁ πατὴρ Ἀαρὼν
τῷ θυμιατηρίῳ καθωπλισμένος, διὰ τοῦ ἐθνοπλήκτου πυρὸς ἐπι-
12 τρέχων τὸν ἐμπυρισμὸν ἐνίκησεν ἄγγελον. Οὕτως δ᾽ Ἀαρωνίδης
Ἐλεάζαρος διὰ τοῦ πυρὸς ὑπερτηκόμενος οὐ μετετράπη τὸν λο-
13 γισμόν. Καίτοι τὸ θαυμασιώτατον, γέρων ὤν, λελυμένων μὲν ἤδη
τῶν τοῦ σώματος τόνων, καὶ περικεχαλασμένων δὲ τῶν σαρ-
14 κῶν, κεχηκότων δὲ καὶ τῶν νεύρων, ἀνενέγκων. Τῷ πνεύματι
τοῦ λογισμοῦ, καὶ τῷ Ἰσραείῳ λογισμῷ τὴν πολυκέφαλον στρέ-

**CHAPTER VI.**

**14** But others, approaching him in admiration of his endurance, even some of the king's men, did say unto him: "Why, O Eleazar, dost thou thus recklessly expose thyself unto these evils?
**15** We, forsooth, shall set before thee of the meats appointed for thee;
**16** but do thou, being [thus] judged to taste of these sacred [meats], be saved." And Eleazar, as if tormented more bitterly by their counsel, cried out:
**17** "Let not we, the children of Abraham, think so ill, that having become fainthearted, we should play a drama unseemly for us.
**18** For it is indeed irrational, if we, having lived a life of truth until old age, and having lawfully guarded the glory upon it, should now change,
**19** and we ourselves should become a pattern of impiety unto the young, that we might become an example of defilement by eating.
**20** For it were shameful if we should live on for a short time, and this time be derided by all for our cowardice;
**21** and by the tyrant indeed be despised as unmanly, and should not cleave to our divine Law even unto death.
**22** Unto these things, then, O children of Abraham, do ye die nobly for the sake of godliness. But ye, O spearmen of the tyrant, what do ye tarry?"
**23** Seeing him so high-minded against the compulsions, and that he was not turned even by their pity,
**24** they led him to the fire. There, with instruments of cruel craft,
**25** they did scrape him, causing his flesh to slip away, and poured foul-smelling liquids into his nostrils.
**26** But he, already burnt down to the bones and about to faint, lifted his eyes towards God, and said:
**27** "Thou knowest, O God, that though it be possible for me to be saved, yet by burning torments do I die for the sake of the Law.
**28** Be gracious unto thy custom, being satisfied with our punishment on their behalf.
**29** Make my blood a purification for them, and take my soul as a ransom for them."
**30** And having said these things, the holy man nobly died amidst the tortures,
**31** and by his reason, he resisted even the tortures of death for the sake of the Law. Acknowledgedly, therefore, is pious reason the master of the passions.
**32** For if the passions had prevailed over reason, unto them would I have given the testimony of mastery.
**33** But now that reason hath vanquished the passions, unto it fittingly do we ascribe the authority of leadership.
**34** And it is just that we confess the power to be of reason, especially since it prevails even over external pains. Since also it is laughable; and not only over the [pains].

**CHAPTER VII.**

**1** As indeed an excellent pilot was the reason of our father Eleazar, steering the ship of godliness in the sea of passions,
**2** and being tormented by the tyrant's threats and overwhelmed by the surging waves of tortures,
**3** in no wise did he turn the rudders of godliness, until he sailed into the harbor of immortal victory.
**4** Not thus did a city besieged with many and diverse engines of war ever resist, as the most holy Eleazar, his sacred soul being set on fire by tortures and racks,
**5** did move those who besieged him, by reason of the reason that defended godliness. For as a precipitous cliff, so did our father Eleazar stretch forth his mind, and break the raging waves of the passions.
**6** O worthy priest of the priesthood, thou didst not defile thy sacred teeth, nor didst thou commune thy belly, which held godliness and lawful purification, with defilement by eating.
**7** O harmonizer with the Law, and philosopher of the divine life!
**8** Such indeed must be they who minister the Law with their own blood,
**9** and with noble sweat defend it against sufferings even unto death. Thou, O father, didst establish our good order [of life] through thy endurance unto glory, and having glorified the holy [Law], thou didst not abolish [it],
**10** and through thy deeds didst authenticate the words of divine philosophy. O old man, more violent than tortures,
**11** and elder, more resilient than fire, and Eleazar, greatest king over passions!
**12** For just as our father Aaron, armed with the censer, by running through the nation-striking fire and the burning, did conquer an angel,
**13** so also Eleazar, son of Aaron, though melted by the fire, did not turn his reason. And yet, most wondrously, being an old man, with the sinews of his body already loosened,
**14** and his flesh grown slack, and his nerves gaping, he endured. By the spirit of his reason, and by Israelite reason, he annulled the many-headed rack.
**15** O blessed old age, and venerable hoary head, and lawful life,
**16** which a faithful seal of death brought to perfection! If then therefore, [he...]
