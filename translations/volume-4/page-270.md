ΚΕΦ. ΙΑ´. ΙΒ´. ΙΗΣΟΥ ΥΙΟΥ ΣΙΡΑΧ 1801
`14` ἐστί. Σοφία καὶ ἐπιστήμη καὶ γνῶσις νόμου παρὰ Κυρίου·
`15` ἀγάπησις καὶ ὁδοὶ καλῶν ἔργων παρ᾽ αὐτοῦ εἰσιν. Πλάνη καὶ
`16` σκότος ἁμαρτωλοῖς συνέκτισται· τοῖς δὲ γαυριῶσιν ἐπὶ κακίᾳ
    συγγενᾷ κακά. Δόσις Κυρίου παραμένει εὐσεβεῖ, καὶ ἡ εὐδο-
`17` κία αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα εὐοδωθήσεται. Ἔστι πλουτῶν ἀπὸ προ-
`18` σοχῆς καὶ σφιγγίας αὐτοῦ, καὶ αὕτη ἡ μερὶς τοῦ μισθοῦ αὐτοῦ· ἐν
`19` τῷ εἰπεῖν αὐτόν· εὗρον ἀνάπαυσιν, καὶ νῦν φάγωμαι ἐκ τῶν ἀγα-
    θῶν μου ἀδιαλείπτως, καὶ οὐκ οἶδε τίς καιρὸς παραλεύσεται, καὶ
    καταλείψει αὐτὰ ἑτέροις, καὶ ἀποθανεῖται. Στῆθι ἐν διαθήκῃ σου
`20` καὶ ὁμίλει ἐν αὐτῇ, καὶ ἐν τῷ ἔργῳ σου παλαιώθητι. Μὴ θαύμαζε
`21` ἐν ἔργοις ἁμαρτωλοῦ, πίστευε δὲ Κυρίῳ, καὶ ἔμμεινε τῷ πόνῳ σου·
    ὅτι κοῦφον ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς Κυρίου, διὰ τάχους ἐξάπινα πλουτίσαι
    πένητα. Εὐλογία Κυρίου ἐν μισθῷ εὐσεβοῦς, καὶ ἐν ὥρᾳ ταχινῇ
`22` ἀναβάλλει εὐλογίαν αὐτοῦ. Μὴ εἴπῃς· τίς ἐστι μοι χρεία, καὶ τίνα
`23` ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν ἔσται μου τὰ ἀγαθά ; μὴ εἴπῃς· αὐτάρκη μοι ἐστι,
`24` καὶ τί ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν κακωθήσομαι ; Ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ἀγαθῶν ἀμνησία κα-
`25` κῶν, καὶ ἐν ἡμέρᾳ κακῶν οὐ μνησθήσεται ἀγαθῶν· ὅτι κοῦφον ἐν
`26` ὀφθαλμοῖς Κυρίου, ἐν ἡμέρᾳ τελευτῆς ἀποδοῦναι ἀνθρώπῳ κατὰ
    τὰς ὁδοὺς αὐτοῦ· κάκωσις ὥρας ἐπιλησμονὴν ποιεῖ τρυφῆς, καὶ ἐν
`27` συντελείᾳ ἀνθρώπου ἀποκάλυψις ἔργων αὐτοῦ. Πρὸ τελευτῆς μὴ
`28` μακάριζε μηδένα, καὶ ἐν τέκνοις αὐτοῦ γνωσθήσεται ἀνήρ. Μὴ
`29` πάντα ἄνθρωπον εἴσαγε εἰς τὸν οἶκόν σου· πολλὰ γὰρ τὰ ἔνεδρα
`30` τοῦ δολίου. Πέρδιξ θηρευτὴς ἐν καρτάλλῳ, οὕτως καρδία ὑπερη-
    φάνου, καὶ ὡς ὁ κατάσκοπος ἐπιβλέψει πτῶσιν· τὰ γὰρ ἀγαθὰ εἰς
`31` κακὰ μεταστρέφων ἐνεδρεύει, καὶ ἐν τοῖς αἱρετοῖς ἐπιθήσει μῶμον.
`32` Ἀπὸ σπινθῆρος πυρὸς πληθύνεται ἀνθρακία· καὶ ἄνθρωπος ἁμαρ-
    τωλὸς εἰς αἷμα ἐνεδρεύει. Πρόσεχε ἀπὸ κακούργου, πονηρὰ γὰρ
`33` τεκταίνει, μήποτε μῶμον εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα δῷ σοι. Ἐνοίκησον ἀλ-
`34` λότριον, καὶ διαστρέψει σε ἐν ταραχαῖς, καὶ ἀπαλλοτριώσει σε τῶν
    ἰδίων σου.

`1` ΕΑΝ εὐποιήσῃς, γνῶθι τίνι ποιεῖς, καὶ ἔσται χάρις τῆς ἀγα-
`2` θότητός σου· εὐποίησον εὐσεβεῖ, καὶ εὑρήσεις ἀνταπόδομα, καὶ εἰ μὴ
    παρ᾽ αὐτοῦ, ἀλλὰ παρὰ τοῦ ὑψίστου. Οὐκ ἔσται ἀγαθὰ τῷ ἐνδε-

**Chapter Eleven**

`14` [are] from the Lord.
`15` Wisdom, and knowledge, and the understanding of the Law are from the Lord; love also and the paths of good works are from Him.
`16` Error and darkness were created with sinners; and evils are born with them that boast in wickedness. The gift of the Lord abideth with the godly, `17` and His good pleasure shall be prospered unto the age [everlasting].
`18` There is one that waxeth rich by his watchfulness and his parsimony, and this is the portion of his recompense; `19` when he saith, 'I have found rest, and now will I eat of my good things without ceasing,' and knoweth not what time shall pass away, and he shall leave them to others, and shall die.
`20` Abide thou in thy covenant, and diligently converse therein; and in thy work grow thou old.
`21` Marvel not at the works of a sinner, but believe thou in the Lord, and abide in thy labor; for it is a light thing in the sight of the Lord, suddenly and swiftly to enrich a poor man.
`22` The blessing of the Lord is in the recompense of the godly, and in a swift hour doth He cause His blessing to spring forth.
`23` Say not, 'What need have I, and what shall my good things be from henceforth?' `24` Say not, 'They are sufficient for me; and what evil shall befall me from henceforth?'
`25` In the day of good fortune, there is forgetfulness of evils; and in the day of evils, good things shall not be remembered.
`26` For it is a light thing in the sight of the Lord, in the day of death, to render unto a man according to his ways. The affliction of an hour maketh men to forget their delights; and in the conclusion of a man's life, `27` there is the revelation of his works.
`28` Before his end, count no man blessed; and in his children shall a man be known.
`29` Bring not every man into thy house; for many are the ambushes of the deceitful.
`30` As a partridge that is hunted in a snare, so is the heart of the proud; and as a spy doth he watch for a fall.
`31` For turning good things into evil, he doth lay an ambush; and upon the elect will he cast reproach.
`32` From a spark of fire, a heap of coals doth multiply; and a sinful man doth lay wait for blood.
`33` Beware of an evil-doer, for he contriveth wicked things, lest he cast upon thee reproach forever.
`34` Take a stranger into thy house, and he shall pervert thee with contentions, and shall alienate thee from thine own.

**Chapter Twelve**

`1` When thou doest good, know unto whom thou doest it; and thy goodness shall be recompensed with favour.
`2` Do good unto the godly, and thou shalt find a recompense; and if not from him, yet surely from the Most High.
`3` There shall no good thing come unto him that continueth in wickedness,
