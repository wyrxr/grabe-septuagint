1 ΣΙΜΩΝ Ὀνίου υἱὸς ὁ ἱερεὺς ὁ μέγας, ὃς ἐν ζωῇ αὐτοῦ ὑπερ-
2 ράψεν οἶκον, καὶ ἐν ἡμέραις αὐτοῦ ἐστερέωσε ναόν, καὶ ὑπ᾽ αὐ-
3 τοῦ ἐθεμελιώθη ὕψος διπλῆς, ἀνάλημμα ὑψηλὸν περιβόλου ἱεροῦ·
4 ἐν ἡμέραις αὐτοῦ ἠλαττώθη ἀποδοχεῖα ὑδάτων, λάκκος ὡσεὶ θα-
5 λάσσης τὸ περίμετρον· ὁ φροντίζων τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ πτώ-
6 σεως, καὶ ἐνισχύσας πόλιν ἐν πολιορκήσει. Ὃς ἐδοξάσθη ἐν πε-
7 ριστροφῇ λαοῦ, ἐν ἐξόδῳ οἴκου καταπετάσματος· ὡς ἀστὴρ ἑω-
8 θινὸς ἐν μέσῳ νεφέλης, ὡς σελήνη πλήρης ἐν ἡμέραις, ὡς ἥλιος
9 ἐκλάμπων ἐπὶ ναὸν ὑψίστου, ὡς τόξον φωτίζον ἐν νεφέλαις δό-
10 ξης· ὡς ἄνθος ῥόδων ἐν ἡμέραις νέων, ὡσεὶ κρίνα ἐπ᾽ ἐξόδῳ ὕδα-
11 τος, ὡς βλαστὸς Λιβάνου ἐν ἡμέραις θέρους· ὡς πῦρ καὶ λίβανος
12 ἐπὶ πυρείου, ὡς σκεῦος χρυσίου ὁλοσφύρητον, κεκοσμημένον παντὶ
13 λίθῳ πολυτελεῖ· ὡς ἐλαία εὐπρεπὴς ἀναβάλ-
14 λουσα καρπούς, καὶ ὡς κυπάρισσος ὑψουμένη ἐν νεφέλαις. Ἐν τῷ ἀναλαμβάνειν αὐ-
15 τὸν στολὴν δόξης, καὶ ἐνδιδύσκεσθαι αὐτὸν συντέλειαν καυχή-
16 ματος, ἐν ἀναβάσει θυσιαστηρίου ἁγίου ἐδόξασε περιβολὴν ἁγιά-
17 σματος· ἐν δὲ τῷ δέχεσθαι μέλη ἐκ χειρῶν ἱερέων, καὶ αὐτὸς
18 ἑστηκὼς παρ᾽ ἐσχάρα βωμοῦ, κυκλόθεν αὐτοῦ στέφανος ἀδελφῶν,
19 ὡς βλάστημα κέδρων ἐν τῷ Λιβάνῳ, καὶ ἐκύκλωσαν αὐτὸν ὡς
20 στελέχη φοινίκων· καὶ πάντες οἱ υἱοὶ Ἀαρὼν ἐν δόξῃ αὐτῶν, καὶ
21 προσφορὰ Κυρίου ἐν χερσὶν αὐτῶν ἔναντι πάσης ἐκκλησίας Ἰσ-
22 ραὴλ· καὶ συντέλειαν λειτουργῶν ἐπὶ βωμῷ, κοσμῆσαι προσφο-
23 ρὰν ὑψίστου παντοκράτορος, ἐξέτεινεν ἐπὶ σπονδείου χεῖρα αὐτοῦ,
24 καὶ ἔσπεισεν ἐξ αἵματος σταφυλῆς· ἐξέχεεν εἰς θεμέλια θυσια-
25 στηρίου ὀσμὴν εὐωδίας ὑψίστῳ παμβασιλεῖ. Τότε ἀνέκραγον οἱ
26 υἱοὶ Ἀαρών, ἐν σάλπιγξιν ἐλαταῖς ἤχησαν, ἀκουστὴν ἐποίησαν
27 φωνὴν μεγάλην εἰς μνημόσυνον ἔναντι ὑψίστου· τότε πᾶς ὁ λαὸς
28 κοινῇ κατέσπευσαν, καὶ ἔπεσαν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, προσ-
29 κυνῆσαι Κυρίῳ παντοκράτορι, Θεῷ ὑψίστῳ· καὶ ἤνεσαν οἱ ψαλ-
30 τῳδοὶ ἐν φωναῖς αὐτῶν, ἐν πλείστῳ ἤχῳ ἐγλυκάνθη μέλος· καὶ
31 ἐδεήθη ὁ λαὸς Κυρίου ὑψίστου ἐν προσευχῇ κατέναντι ἐλεήμο-
32 νος, ἕως συντελεσθῇ κόσμος Κυρίου, καὶ τὴν λειτουργίαν αὐ-
33 τοῦ ἐτελείωσαν. Τότε καταβὰς ἐπῆρε χεῖρας αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ πᾶσαν
34 ἐκκλησίαν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, δοῦναι εὐλογίαν Κυρίου ἐκ χειλέων αὐ-

**Chapter Fifty**

1 Simon the son of Onias, the great priest;
he in his life did repair the house,
2 and in his days did strengthen the temple;
and by him was founded a double height,
a high retaining wall of the sacred precinct.
4 In his days were the water-reservoirs made deep,
a pit whose compass was as the sea;
he who watched over his people from their ruin,
6 and strengthened the city in time of siege.
He was glorified in the procession of the people,
at his coming forth from the house of the veil.
7 As a morning star in the midst of a cloud,
as a full moon in her days,
as the sun that shineth forth upon the temple of the Most High,
9 as a rainbow gleaming in clouds of glory;
as a flower of roses in the days of spring,
10 as lilies by the streams of water,
as a shoot of Lebanon in the days of summer;
11 as fire and frankincense upon the censer,
as a vessel of solid hammered gold,
adorned with every precious stone;
13 as a fair olive tree putting forth its fruits,
and as a cypress tree towering high among the clouds.
14 When he took up the robe of glory,
and did array himself with the perfection of his glory,
16 when he ascended the holy altar,
he did glorify the vestment of holiness;
and when he received the portions from the hands of the priests,
17 and he himself stood by the hearth of the altar,
a crown of brethren was round about him,
19 as a growth of cedars in Lebanon,
and they encircled him as palm stems;
20 and all the sons of Aaron in their glory,
and the offering of the Lord was in their hands
before all the congregation of Israel;
22 and the perfection of the ministers' service upon the altar,
to adorn the offering of the Most High Almighty,
he stretched forth his hand upon the libation bowl,
24 and poured out from the blood of the grape;
he poured it out upon the foundations of the altar,
a sweet fragrance to the Most High, the All-King.
25 Then did the sons of Aaron cry out,
in trumpets of fir-wood they sounded,
26 they made a great voice heard for a remembrance before the Most High;
then all the people together hastened,
and fell upon their faces upon the earth,
29 to worship the Lord Almighty, God Most High;
and the psalm-singers praised with their voices,
in the greatest sound was the melody sweetened;
30 and the people entreated the Lord Most High in prayer
before the Merciful One,
32 until the order of the Lord's [worship] was completed,
and they finished His ministry.
Then, having descended, he lifted his hands
33 over all the assembly of the sons of Israel,
to give the blessing of the Lord from his lips,
