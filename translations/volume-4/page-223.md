ΚΕΦ. Β΄. ΒΑΡΟΥΧ
20 ἐφ᾽ ἡμᾶς, καθάπερ ἐλάλησας ἐν χειρὶ τῶν παίδων σου τῶν προφητῶν,
21 λέγων· οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος· κλίνατε τὸν ὦμον ὑμῶν καὶ ἐργάσασθε
τῷ βασιλεῖ Βαβυλῶνος, καὶ καθίσατε ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, ἧς ἔδωκα τοῖς
22 πατράσιν ὑμῶν. Καὶ ἐὰν μὴ ἀκούσητε τῆς φωνῆς Κυρίου, ἐργά-
ζεσθαι τῷ βασιλεῖ Βαβυλῶνος, ἐκλείψειν ποιήσω ἐκ πόλεων Ἰούδα
23 καὶ ἔξωθεν Ἱερουσαλὴμ φωνὴν εὐφροσύνης, καὶ φωνὴν χαρμοσύ-
νης, φωνὴν νυμφίου, καὶ φωνὴν νύμφης, καὶ ἔσται πᾶσα ἡ γῆ εἰς
24 ἄβατον ἀπὸ ἐνοικούντων. Καὶ οὐκ ἠκούσαμεν τῆς φωνῆς σου, ἐρ-
γάζεσθαι τῷ βασιλεῖ Βαβυλῶνος· καὶ ἔστησας τοὺς λόγους σου,
οὓς ἐλάλησας ἐν χερσὶ τῶν παίδων σου τῶν προφητῶν, τοῦ ἐξε-
νεχθῆναι τὰ ὀστᾶ τῶν βασιλέων ἡμῶν, καὶ τὰ ὀστᾶ τῶν ἀρχόν-
των ἡμῶν, καὶ τὰ ὀστᾶ τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν ἐκ τοῦ τόπου αὐτῶν,
25 καὶ ἰδοὺ εἰσιν ἐξεῤῥιμμένα τῷ καύματι τῆς ἡμέρας, καὶ τῷ παγετῷ
τῆς νυκτός· καὶ ἀπεθάνοσαν ἐν πόνοις πονηροῖς, ἐν λιμῷ, καὶ ἐν
26 ῥομφαίᾳ, καὶ ἐν ἀποστολῇ. Καὶ ἔθηκας τὸν οἶκόν σου, οὗ ἐπε-
κλήθη τὸ ὄνομά σου ἐπ᾽ αὐτῷ, ὡς ἡ ἡμέρα αὕτη, διὰ πονηρίαν
οἴκου Ἰσραὴλ καὶ οἴκου Ἰούδα.
27 Καὶ ἐποίησας εἰς ἡμᾶς, Κύριε ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν, κατὰ πᾶσαν ἐπιείκειάν
σου, καὶ κατὰ πάντα οἰκτιρμόν σου τὸν μέγαν, καθὰ ἐλάλησας
ἐν χειρὶ παιδός σου Μωσῆ, ἐν
28 ἡμέρᾳ ἐντειλαμένου σου αὐτῷ γράψαι τὸν νόμον σου ἐνώπιον υἱῶν
29 Ἰσραήλ, λέγων· ἐὰν μὴ ἀκούσητε τῆς φωνῆς μου, εἰ μὴ ἡ βρόμ-
βησις ἡ μεγάλη, καὶ ἡ πολλὴ αὕτη ἀποστρέψει εἰς μικρὰν ἐν τοῖς
30 ἔθνεσιν, οὗ διασπερῶ αὐτοὺς ἐκεῖ. Ὅτι ἔγνων, ὅτι οὐ μὴ εἰσακούσωσι
μοι, ὅτι λαὸς σκληροτράχηλός ἐστι· καὶ ἐπιστρέψουσιν ἐπὶ καρδίαν
31 αὐτῶν ἐν γῇ ἀποικισμοῦ αὐτῶν, καὶ γνώσονται, ὅτι ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ
32 Θεὸς αὐτῶν· καὶ δώσω αὐτοῖς καρδίαν καὶ ὦτα ἀκούοντα, καὶ αἰνέ-
σουσί με ἐν γῇ ἀποικισμοῦ αὐτῶν, καὶ μνησθήσονται τοῦ ὀνόματός
33 μου, καὶ ἀποστρέψουσιν ἀπὸ νώτου αὐτῶν τοῦ σκληροῦ, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν
πονηρῶν πραγμάτων αὐτῶν, ἔτι μνησθήσονται τῆς ὁδοῦ πατέρων αὐ-
τῶν τῶν ἁμαρτόντων ἔναντι Κυρίου.
34 Καὶ ἀποστρέψω αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν γῆν, ἣν ὤμοσα τοῖς πατράσιν αὐτῶν,
τῷ Ἀβραάμ, καὶ τῷ Ἰσαὰκ καὶ τῷ Ἰακώβ. καὶ κυριεύσουσιν αὐτῆς·
καὶ πληθυνῶ αὐτοὺς, καὶ
35 οὐ μὴ σμικρυνθῶσιν. Καὶ στήσω αὐτοῖς διαθήκην αἰώνιον, τοῦ εἶ-
ναί με αὐτοῖς εἰς Θεόν, καὶ αὐτοὶ ἔσονται μοι εἰς λαόν· καὶ οὐ
κινήσω ἔτι τὸν λαόν μου Ἰσραὴλ ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς, ἧς ἔδωκα αὐτοῖς.

**CHAPTER II.**

**20** ...upon us, even as Thou spakest by the hand of Thy servants the prophets,
**21** saying, "Thus saith the Lord: Incline your shoulder, and serve the king of Babylon, and dwell in the land which I gave unto your fathers.
**22** And if ye hearken not unto the voice of the Lord, to serve the king of Babylon, I will cause to cease from the cities of Judah,
**23** and from without Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride; and all the land shall become a
**24** desolation, without inhabitant." And we hearkened not unto thy voice, to serve the king of Babylon; and Thou didst establish thy words, which Thou spakest by the hands of thy servants the prophets, to bring forth the bones of our kings, and the bones of our princes, and the bones of our fathers out of their place;
**25** and lo, they are cast forth to the heat of the day, and to the frost of the night; and they died in grievous pains, in famine, and by the
**26** sword, and by pestilence. And Thou hast made Thy house, whereon Thy Name was called, as it is this day, because of the wickedness of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah.
**27** And Thou hast dealt with us, O Lord our God, according to all Thy forbearance, and according to all Thy great compassion, even as Thou spakest
**28** by the hand of Thy servant Moses, in the day when Thou didst command him to write Thy law before the sons of
**29** Israel, saying, "If ye hearken not unto My voice, except that this great and mighty tumult shall turn into a small [one] among the
**30** nations, where I shall scatter them. For I knew that they would not hearken unto Me, for they are a stiff-necked people; yet they shall turn unto their heart
**31** in the land of their captivity, and shall know that I am the Lord their God; and I will give them a heart and ears to hear, and they shall
**32** praise Me in the land of their captivity, and shall remember My Name, and shall turn away from the hardness of their back, and from their
**33** evil deeds; yea, they shall remember the way of their fathers, who sinned before the Lord.
**34** And I will bring them again into the land, which I sware unto their fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and they shall possess it; and I will multiply them, and
**35** they shall not be diminished. And I will establish with them an everlasting covenant, that I may be unto them a God, and they shall be unto Me a people; and I will no more remove My people Israel from the land which I gave unto them."
