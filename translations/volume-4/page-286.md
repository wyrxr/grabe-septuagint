δυνάμεως αὐτοῦ κουχήσεται· ἐγὼ ἀπὸ στόματος ὑψίστου ἐξῆλθον, 3
καὶ ὡς ὁμίχλη κατεκάλυψα γῆν. Ἐγὼ ἐν ὑψηλοῖς κατεσκήνωσα, 4
καὶ ὁ θρόνος μου ἐν στύλῳ νεφέλης· γῦρον οὐρανοῦ ἐκύκλωσα 5
μόνη, καὶ ἐν βάθει ἀβύσσων περιπάτησα· ἐν κύματι θαλάσσης, 6
καὶ ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ, καὶ ἐν παντὶ λαῷ καὶ ἔθνει ἐκτησάμην· μετὰ 7
τούτων πάντων ἐζήτησα ἀνάπαυσιν, καὶ ἐν κληρονομίᾳ τίνος αὐλι-
σθήσομαι; Τότε ἐνετείλατό μοι ὁ κτίστης ἁπάντων, καὶ ὁ κτί- 8
σας με κατέπαυσε τὴν σκηνήν μου, καὶ εἶπεν· ἐν Ἰακὼβ κατασκή-
νωσον, καὶ ἐν Ἰσραὴλ κληρονομήθητι. Πρὸ τοῦ αἰῶνος ἀπαρχὴν 9
ἔκτισέ με, καὶ ἕως αἰώνων οὐ μὴ ἐκλίπω. Ἐν σκηνῇ ἁγίᾳ ἐνώ- 10
πιον αὐτοῦ ἐλειτούργουν, καὶ οὕτως ἐν Σιὼν ἐστηρίχθην· ἐν πό- 11
λει ἠγαπημένῃ ὁμοίως με κατέπαυσε, καὶ ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐξου-
σίαν μου· καὶ ἐῤῥίζωσα ἐν λαῷ δεδοξασμένῳ, ἐν μερίδι Κυρίου 12
κληρονομίας αὐτοῦ. Ὡς κέδρος ἀνυψώθην ἐν τῷ Λιβάνῳ, καὶ 13
ὡς κυπάρισσος ἐν ὄρει Ἀερμών· ὡς φοῖνιξ ἀνυψώθην ἐν Ἐνγαδδί, 14
καὶ ὡς φυτὰ ῥόδου ἐν Ἰεριχῶ, καὶ ὡς ἐλαία εὐπρεπὴς ἐν πεδίῳ,
καὶ ἀνυψώθην ὡς πλάτανος ἐφ᾽ ὕδατος· ὡς κιννάμωμον καὶ ἀσπά- 15
λαθος ἀρωμάτων δέδωκα ὀσμήν, καὶ ὡς σμύρνα ἐκλεκτὴ διέδωκα
εὐωδίαν, καὶ ὡς χαλβάνη καὶ ὄνυξ καὶ στακτή, καὶ ὡς λιβάνου
ἀτμὶς ἐν σκηνῇ· ἐγὼ δὲ ὡς τερέβινθος ἐξέτεινα κλάδους μου, καὶ 16
οἱ κλάδοι μου κλάδοι δόξης καὶ χάριτος· ἐγὼ ὡς ἄμπελος ἐβλά- 17
στησα χάριν, καὶ τὰ ἄνθη μου καρπὶς δόξης καὶ πλούτου. Ἐγὼ 18
μήτηρ τῆς ἀγαπήσεως τῆς καλῆς, καὶ φόβου καὶ γνώσεως καὶ
τῆς ὁσίας ἐλπίδος· δίδομαι δὲ σύμπασι τοῖς τέκνοις μου ἀειγενὲς,
τοῖς λεγομένοις ὑπ᾽ αὐτοῦ. Προσέλατε πρός με οἱ ἐπιθυμοῦντές 19
μου, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν γεννημάτων μου ἐμπλήσθητε· τὸ γὰρ μνημό- 20
συνόν μου ὑπὲρ τὸ μέλι (τὸ) γλυκύ, καὶ ἡ κληρονομία μου ὑπὲρ
μέλιτος καὶ κηρίου. Οἱ ἐσθίοντές με ἔτι πεινάσουσι, καὶ οἱ πί- 21
νοντές με ἔτι διψήσουσι· ὁ ὑπακούων μου οὐκ αἰσχυνθήσεται· καὶ 22
οἱ ἐργαζόμενοι ἐν ἐμοὶ οὐχ ἁμαρτήσουσι. Ταῦτα πάντα βίβλος 23
διαθήκης Θεοῦ ὑψίστου, νόμος ὃν ἐνετείλατο ἡμῖν Μωσῆς, κλη-
ρονομίαν συναγωγαῖς Ἰακώβ. Μὴ ἐκλέσθε ἰσχὺν ἐν Κυρίῳ, κολ- 24
λᾶσθε δὲ πρὸς αὐτὸν ἵνα κραταιώσῃ ὑμᾶς αὐτός. Κύριος παντο-
κράτωρ ὁ Θεὸς μόνος ἐστι, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἔτι πλὴν αὐτοῦ σω- 25
τήρ· ὁ πιπλῶν ὡς Φεισὼν σοφίαν, καὶ ὡς Τίγρις ἐν ἡμέραις νέων 26
ὁ ἀναπληρῶν ὡς Εὐφράτης σύνεσιν, καὶ ὡς Ἰορδάνης ἐν ἡμέραις

**Chapter Twenty-Four**
**The Praise of Wisdom**

3 [His] power, she shall be made light.
I from the mouth of the Most High came forth, and as a mist did I cover the earth.
4 I in high places have made my dwelling, and my throne is in a pillar of cloud.
5 The circuit of heaven did I alone encompass, and in the depth of the abysses have I walked.
6 In the wave of the sea, and in all the earth, and in every people and nation have I gained possession.
7 Among all these did I seek for rest, and in whose inheritance shall I take up my dwelling?
8 Then did the Creator of all things command me, and He that created me settled my tabernacle, and He said:
"In Jacob do thou make thy dwelling, and in Israel be thou inherited."
9 Before the age, as a first-beginning did He create me, and unto the ages shall I not fail.
10 In the holy tabernacle before Him did I minister, and thus in Zion was I established.
11 In a city beloved did He likewise settle me, and in Jerusalem [He placed] my authority.
12 And I took root in a people glorified, in the portion of the Lord, of His inheritance.
13 As a cedar was I exalted in Lebanon, and as a cypress in Mount Hermon.
14 As a palm tree was I exalted in Engedi, and as plants of roses in Jericho,
and as a comely olive tree in the plain, and I was exalted as a plane tree beside water.
15 As cinnamon and aromatic spikenard did I yield a fragrance,
and as choice myrrh did I diffuse a sweet savor,
and as galbanum and onycha and stacte, and as the vapor of frankincense in the tabernacle.
16 But I, as a terebinth tree, did stretch forth my branches,
and my branches are branches of glory and of grace.
17 I as a vine brought forth grace, and my blossoms [are] fruit of glory and of wealth.
18 I am the mother of good love, and of fear, and of knowledge, and of holy hope.
And I am given, an everlasting [boon], to all my children, to those who are called by Him.
19 Draw near unto me, ye that desire me, and from my products be ye filled.
20 For my memorial is beyond the sweet honey, and my inheritance is beyond honey and the honeycomb.
21 They that eat me shall yet hunger, and they that drink me shall yet thirst.
22 He that obeyeth me shall not be ashamed, and they that work in me shall not sin.
23 All these things are the book of the covenant of God Most High,
the Law which Moses commanded us, an inheritance to the congregations of Jacob.
24 Be ye not weary in the Lord, but cleave ye unto Him, that He Himself may strengthen you.
25 The Lord Almighty, God, alone He is; and there is no other Savior beside Him.
26 He that filleth with wisdom as Pishon, and as Tigris in days of fresh yields;
He that filleth up with understanding as Euphrates, and as Jordan in days [of harvest].
