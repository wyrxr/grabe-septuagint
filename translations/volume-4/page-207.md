**16** σπίζοντα. Καὶ τῶν δορυφόρων λεγόντων, ὁμολόγησον φαγεῖν,
**17** ὅπως ἀπαλλαγῆς τῶν βασάνων. Αὐτὸς εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· οὐχ οὕτως
ἰσχυρὰ ὑμῶν ἐστιν ὁ τροχὸς, ὦ μιαροὶ διάκονοι, ὥστε μου
τὸν λογισμὸν ἀεὶ τέμνετέ μου μέλη, καὶ πυροῦτε τὰς σάρ-
**18** κας, καὶ στρεβλοῦτε τὰ ἄρθρα. Διὰ πασῶν γὰρ ὑμᾶς πείσω
τῶν βασάνων· ἔτι μόνοι παῖδες Ἑβραίων ὑπὲρ ἀρετῆς εἰσιν ἀνί-
**19** κητοι. Ταῦτα λέγοντι πῦρ ὑπέστρωσαν, καὶ διηρέθισαν, τὸν τρο-
**20** χὸν προσεπικατατείνοντες. Ἐμολύνετο δὲ πάντοθεν αἵματι ὁ τρο-
χὸς, καὶ ὁ σωρὶς τῆς ἀνθρακιᾶς τῆς τῶν ἰχώρων ἐσβέννυτο σκα-
λαγμοῖς, καὶ περὶ τοὺς ἄξονας τοῦ ὀργάνου περιέρρεον αἱ σάρ-
**21** κες. Καὶ περιτετμημένον ἤδη ἔχων τὸ τῶν ὀστέων πῆγμα ὁ
**22** μεγαλόρρων καὶ Ἀβραμιαῖος νεανίας οὐκ ἐστέναξεν. Ἀλλ᾽ ὥσ-
περ ἐν πυρὶ μετασχηματιζόμενος εἰς ἀφθαρσίαν, ὑπέμεινεν εὐγε-
**23** νῶς τὰς στρέβλας. Μιμήσασθέ με, ἀδελφοὶ, λέγων· μὴ μου
τὸν αἰῶνα λιποτακτήσητε, μηδ᾽ ἐξομόσησθέ μου τὴν τῆς εὐψυ-
χίας ἀδελφότητα· ἱερὰν καὶ εὐγενῆ στρατείαν στρατεύσασθε ὑπὲρ
**24** τῆς εὐσεβείας. Δι᾽ ἧς ἵλεως ἡ δικαία καὶ πάτριος ἡμῶν πρό-
**25** νοια τῷ ἔθνει γενηθεῖσα τιμωρήσῃ τὸν ἀλάστορα τύραννον. Καὶ
**26** ταῦτα εἰπὼν ὁ ἱεροπρεπὴς νεανίας, ἀπέῤῥηξεν τὴν ψυχήν. Θαυ-
μασάντων δὲ πάντων τὴν καρτεροψυχίαν αὐτοῦ, ἤγον οἱ δορυφόροι
**27** τὸν καθ᾽ ἡλικίαν τοῦ προτέρου δεύτερον, καὶ σιδηρᾶς ἐναρμό-
σάμενοι χεῖρας ἐξέζεσιν τοῖς ὄνυξιν, τοῖς ὀργάνοις καταπέλτῃ προσ-
**28** έδησαν αὐτόν. Ὡς δὲ, εἰ φαγεῖν βούλοιτο πρὶν βασανίζεσθαι συν-
θανόμενοι, τὴν εὐγενῆ γνώμην ἤκουσαν· ἀπὸ τῶν τενόντων ταῖς
**29** σιδηραῖς χερσὶν ἐπισπασάμενοι, μέχρι γε τῶν γενείων τὴν σάρ-
κα πᾶσαν καὶ τὴν τῆς κεφαλῆς δορὰν οἱ παρδάλειοι θῆρες ἀπέ-
**29** συραν· ὁ δὲ ταύτην βαρέως τὴν ἀλγηδόνα καρτερῶν, ἔλεγεν· Ὡς
**30** ἡδὺς πᾶς τρόπος θανάτου, διὰ τὴν πάτριον ἡμῶν εὐσέβειαν· ἔφη
τε πρὸς τὸν τύραννον. Οὐ δοκεῖ σοι, πάντων ὠμότατε τύραννε,
πλεῖον ἐμοῦ σε νῦν βασανίζεσθαι, ὁρῶντά σου νικώμενον τὸν τῆς
τυραννίδος ὑπερήφανον λογισμὸν ὑπὸ τῆς διὰ τὴν εὐσέβειαν ἡμῶν
**31** ὑπομονῆς. Ἐγὼ μὲν γὰρ ταῖς διὰ τὴν ἀρετὴν ἡδοναῖς τὸν πό-
**32** νον ἐπικουφίζομαι. Σὺ δὲ ἐν ταῖς τῆς ἀσεβείας ἀπειλαῖς βασα-
νίζῃ· οὐκ ἐκφεύξῃ δὲ, μιαρώτατε τύραννε, τὰς τῆς θείας ὀρ-
γῆς δίκας.

**CHAPTER IX.**

**16** [but as one] defending divine law." And when the guards did say, "Confess now, and eat,
**17** that thou mayest be delivered from these torments." But he said unto them, "Not so
strong is your wheel, O defiled ministers, as to overcome my reason,
[though] ye continually cut my limbs, and scorch my flesh,
**18** and twist my joints. For through all your tortures shall I convince you:
the children of Hebrews alone remain unconquered for virtue's sake."
**19** As he spake these words, they laid fire beneath him, and further provoked [his pain],
**20** stretching him ever tighter upon the wheel. And the wheel was defiled
with blood from every side, and the heap of coals was quenched by the
drippings of his humors, and around the axles of the instrument flowed
**21** his flesh. And though his bony framework was already torn all about, the
**22** magnanimous and Abrahamic young man did not groan. But rather,
as one being transformed by fire unto incorruption, he nobly endured
**23** the twistings. "Imitate me, brethren," said he, "desert not my [pattern of] life
for all time, neither abjure my brotherhood of courage; but wage a sacred
and noble warfare for
**24** piety. Through which, may our just and ancestral Providence, having become propitious
**25** unto our nation, punish the accursed tyrant." And
**26** having spoken these things, the priest-like young man yielded up his soul.
And when all had marveled at his steadfast courage, the guards led forth
**27** the second in age after the former, and having fitted iron claws [unto him],
they boiled out with their nails, and with the instruments by means of a catapult,
**28** they bound him. When they heard his noble resolve—[namely], if he would be willing to eat before
being tortured—[even as they themselves were] dying with [the effort to break him],
**29** then from the tendons with the iron claws, they, these leopard-like beasts,
having pulled off all the flesh unto his very chin, and the skin of his head, did tear away.
**29** But he, patiently enduring this grievous pain, did say: "How
**30** sweet is every manner of death for our ancestral piety!" And
he spake unto the tyrant: "Doth it not seem unto thee, O most cruel tyrant
of all, that thou art now tortured more than I, as thou dost see thy proud
reason of tyranny being overcome by our endurance for piety's sake?
**31** For I, through the pleasures of virtue, do find relief from my pain.
**32** But thou art tormented by the threats of impiety; yet shalt thou not escape,
O most defiled tyrant, the judgments of divine wrath."
