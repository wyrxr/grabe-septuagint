ΚΕΦ. ΜΗ΄. XLVIII.

1 ΚΑΙ ἀνέστη Ἠλίας προφήτης ὡς πῦρ, καὶ ὁ λόγος αὐτοῦ
2 ὡς λαμπὰς ἐκαίετο· ὃς ἐπήγαγεν ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς λιμὸν ἰσχυρόν, καὶ
3 τῷ ζήλῳ αὐτοῦ ὠλιγοποίησεν αὐτούς· ἐν λόγῳ Κυρίου ἀνέσχεν
4 οὐρανόν, κατήγαγεν οὕτως τρὶς πῦρ. Ὡς ἐδοξάσθης Ἠλία ἐν
5 θαυμασίοις σου; καὶ τίς ὅμοιός σοι καυχήσεται; Ὁ ἐγείρας
6 νεκρὸν ἐκ θανάτου, καὶ ἐξ ᾅδου ψυχὴν ἐν λόγῳ ὑψίστου· ὁ κατα-
7 γαγὼν βασιλεῖς εἰς ἀπώλειαν, καὶ δεδοξασμένους ἀπὸ κλίνης αὐ-
8 τῶν. Ἀκούων ἐν Σινᾶ ἐλεγμὸν Κυρίου, καὶ ἐν Χωρὴβ κρίματα
9 ἐκδικήσεως. Ὁ χρίων βασιλεῖς εἰς ἀνταπόδομα, καὶ προφήτας
10 διαδόχους μετ’ αὐτόν. Ὁ ἀναληφθεὶς ἐν λαίλαπι πυρὸς ἐν ἅρμα-
11 τι ἵππων πυρίνων· ὁ καταγραφεὶς ἐν ἐλεγμοῖς εἰς καιρούς, κοπά-
    σαι ὀργὴν κρίσεως Κυρίου πρὸ θυμοῦ, καὶ ἐπιστρέψαι καρδίαν
12 πατρὸς πρὸς υἱόν, καὶ καταστῆσαι φυλὰς Ἰακώβ. Μακάριοι οἱ
    ἰδόντες σε καὶ οἱ ἐν ἀγαπήσει κεκοιμημένοι· καὶ γὰρ ἡμεῖς ζωῇ
13 ζησόμεθα. Ἠλίας, ὡς ἐν λαίλαπι ἐσκεπάσθη, καὶ Ἐλισιὲ ἐπλή-
    σθη πνεύματος αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐν ἡμέραις αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἐσαλεύθη
    ὑπὸ ἄρχοντος, καὶ οὐ κατεδυνάστευσεν αὐτὸν οὐδείς· πᾶς λό-
14 γος οὐχ ὑπερῆρεν αὐτόν, καὶ ἐν κοιμήσει ἐπροφήτευσε τὸ σῶ-
15 μα αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐν ζωῇ αὐτοῦ ἐποίησε τέρατα, καὶ ἐν τελευτῇ
16 θαυμάσια τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ. Ἐν πᾶσι τούτοις οὐ μετενόησεν ὁ
    λαός, καὶ οὐκ ἀπέστησαν ἀπὸ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν αὐτῶν, ἕως ἐπρονο-
    μεύθησαν ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς αὐτῶν, καὶ διεσκορπίσθησαν ἐν πάσῃ τῇ
17 γῇ. Καὶ κατελείφθη ὁ λαὸς ὀλιγοστός, καὶ ἄρχων ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ
    Δαυίδ· τινὲς μὲν αὐτῶν ἐποίησαν τὸ ἀρεστόν, τινὲς δὲ ἐπλήθυναν
18 ἁμαρτίας. Ἑζεκίας ὠχύρωσε τὴν πόλιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἰσήγαγεν
    εἰς μέσον αὐτῆς ὕδωρ· ὤρυξεν ἐν σιδήρῳ ἀκρότομον, καὶ ᾠκοδό-
19 μησε κρήνας εἰς ὕδατα. Ἐν ἡμέραις αὐτοῦ ἀνέβη Σενναχηρείμ,
    καὶ ἀπέστειλε Ῥαψάκην, καὶ ἀπῆρεν ἐκ Λαχείρ· καὶ ἐπῆρε χεῖρα
20 αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ Σιών, καὶ ἐμεγαλάυχμησεν ὑπερηφανία αὐτοῦ. Τότε
    ἐσαλεύθησαν καρδίαι καὶ αἱ χεῖρες αὐτῶν, καὶ ὠδίνησαν ὡς αἱ τί-
21 κτουσαι· καὶ ἐπεκαλέσαντο τὸν Κύριον τὸν ἐλεήμονα, ἐκπετάσαν-
    τες τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν πρὸς αὐτόν· καὶ ὁ ἅγιος ἐξ οὐρανοῦ ταχὺ
    ἐπήκουσεν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐλυτρώσατο αὐτοὺς ἐν χειρὶ Ἡσαΐου· ἐπά-
    ταξε τὴν παρεμβολὴν τῶν Ἀσσυρίων, καὶ ἐξέτριψεν αὐτοὺς ὁ ἄγ-

**Chapter Forty-Eight**

1 And there arose Elijah the prophet as fire,
and his word burned as a torch.
2 He brought upon them a mighty famine,
and by his zeal he made them few.
3 By the word of the Lord he held back the heaven,
and thus brought down fire thrice.
4 How wast thou glorified, Elijah, in thy wondrous works?
And who shall boast like unto thee?
5 He who raised a dead man from death,
and a soul from Hades by the word of the Most High;
6 He who brought down kings to perdition,
and those who had been glorified from their couches.
7 He who heard on Sinai the Lord’s rebuke,
and on Horeb judgments of vengeance.
8 He who anointed kings for recompense,
and prophets as successors after him;
9 He who was taken up in a whirlwind of fire,
in a chariot of fiery horses;
10 He who was inscribed in reproofs for [future] times,
to turn away the wrath of the Lord’s judgment ere [it cometh with] fury,
and to turn the heart of the father unto the son,
and to restore the tribes of Jacob.
11 Blessed are they who have seen thee,
and they who have fallen asleep in love;
for we also shall live [unto life everlasting].
12 Elijah, as it were in a whirlwind, was covered;
and Elisha was filled with his spirit.
13 And in his days he was not moved by any ruler,
nor did any man oppress him;
no word did overcome him,
14 and in his death his body prophesied.
15 And in his life he wrought wonders,
and in his death marvelous were his works.
16 In all these things the people did not repent,
neither did they turn away from their sins,
until they were plundered from their land,
and were scattered throughout all the earth.
17 And a small remnant of the people was left,
and a ruler in the house of David;
some of them did that which was pleasing,
but others multiplied sins.
18 Hezekiah fortified his city,
and brought water into the midst thereof;
he dug with iron through a precipitous rock,
and built fountains for water.
19 In his days Sennacherib went up,
and sent Rabshakeh, and he departed from Lachish;
and he lifted up his hand against Zion,
and vaunted in his pride.
20 Then were their hearts and their hands shaken,
and they travailed as women in childbed;
21 and they called upon the Lord, the Merciful One,
stretching forth their hands unto Him;
and the Holy One from heaven quickly heard them,
and delivered them by the hand of Isaiah.
He struck the camp of the Assyrians,
and His angel utterly destroyed them.
