**28** οὔτε πτωχῷ οὔτε ἀδυνάτῳ μεταδιδάσκει τῶν θυσιῶν αὐτῶν ἀποκαθιμένη, καὶ λεχὼ ἅπτονται·
**29** γνόντες οὖν ἀπὸ τούτων ὅτι οὐκ εἰσὶ θεοί, μὴ φοβηθῆτε αὐτούς.
**30** Πόθεν γὰρ κληθεῖσαν θεοί; ὅτι γυναῖκες παρατιθέασι θεοῖς ἀργυροῖς καὶ ξυλίνοις· καὶ ἐν τοῖς οἴκοις αὐτῶν οἱ ἱερεῖς διφρεύουσιν,
**31** ἔχοντες τοὺς χιτῶνας διερρωγότας, καὶ τὰς κεφαλὰς καὶ τοὺς πώγωνας ἐξυρημένοι, ὧν αἱ κεφαλαὶ ἀκάλυπτοι εἰσιν, ὠρύονται
**32** δὲ βοῶντες ἐναντίον τῶν θεῶν αὐτῶν, ὥσπερ τινὲς ἐν περιδείπνῳ νεκροῦ, ἀπὸ τοῦ ἱματισμοῦ αὐτῶν ἀφελόμενοι οἱ ἱερεῖς
**33** ἐνδύουσι τὰς γυναῖκας αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ παιδία, οὔτε ἐὰν κακὸν πάθωσιν ὑπό τινος, οὔτε ἐὰν ἀγαθόν, δυνήσονται ἀνταποδοῦναι· οὔτε
**34** καταστῆσαι βασιλέα δύνανται, οὔτε ἀφελέσθαι, ὡσαύτως οὔτε πλοῦτον, οὔτε χαλκόν, οὐ μὴ δύνωνται διδόναι· ἐάν τις αὐτοῖς
**35** εὐχὴν εὐξάμενος μὴ ἀποδῷ, οὐ μὴ ἐπιζητήσωσιν· ἐκ θανάτου ἄνθρωπον
**36** οὐ μὴ ῥύσωνται, οὔτε ἤττονα ἀπὸ ἰσχυροῦ οὐ μὴ ἐξέλωνται, ἄνθρωπον τυφλὸν εἰς ὅρασιν οὐ μὴ παραστήσωσιν, ἐν ἀνάγκῃ
**37** ἄνθρωπον ὄντα οὐ μὴ ἐξελῶνται, χήραν οὐ μὴ ἐλεήσωσιν, οὔτε ὀρφανὸν εὖ ποιήσωσι.
**38** Τοῖς ἀπὸ τοῦ ὄρους λίθοις ὡμοιώμενοι εἰσὶ τὰ ξύλινα, καὶ τὰ περίχρυσα, καὶ τὰ περιάργυρα, οἱ δὲ θεραπεύοντες αὐτὰ καταισχυνθήσονται.
**39** Πῶς οὖν νομιστέον, ἢ κλητέον αὐτοὺς ὑπάρχειν Θεούς;
**40** Ἔτι δὲ καὶ αὐτῶν τῶν Χαλδαίων ἀτιμαζόντων αὐτά, οἳ ὅταν ἴδωσιν ἐνεὸν οὐ δυνάμενον λαλῆσαι, προσενεγκάμενοι τὸν Βὴλ ἀξιοῦσι τότε λαλῆσαι, ὡς δυνατοῦ
**41** ὄντος αὐτοῦ αἰσθέσθαι, καὶ οὐ δύνανται αὐτοὶ τοῦτο νοήσαντες καταλιπεῖν αὐτά, αἴσθησιν γὰρ οὐκ ἔχουσιν.
**42** Αἱ δὲ γυναῖκες περιτιθέμεναι σχοινία ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς ἐγκάθηνται, θυμιῶσαι
**43** τὰ πίτυρα. Ὅταν δέ τις αὐτῶν ἐφελκυσθεῖσα ὑπό τινος τῶν παραπορευομένων κοιμηθῇ μετ᾽ αὐτῆς, τὴν πλησίον αὐτῆς ἐνειδίζει, ὅτι οὐκ ἠξίωται ὥσπερ καὶ αὐτή, οὐδὲ τὸ σχοινίον αὐτῆς διεφθάγη.
**44** Πάντα τὰ γινόμενα παρ᾽ αὐτοῖς ἐστι ψευδῆ· πῶς οὖν νομιστέον ἢ κλητέον ὡς θεοὺς αὐτοὺς ὑπάρχειν;
**45** Ὑπὸ τεκτόνων καὶ χρυσοχόων κατεσκευασμένα ἐστίν· οὐδὲν γὰρ ἄλλο οὐ μὴ γένωνται, ἢ ἃ βούλονται οἱ τεχνῖται αὐτὰ γενέσθαι.
**46** Αὐτοί τε οἱ κατασκευάζοντες αὐτὰ οὐ μὴ γένωνται πολυχρόνιοι.
**47** Πῶς οὖν μέλλει τὰ ὑπ᾽ αὐτῶν κατασκευασθέντα εἶναι θεοί; κατέλιπον γὰρ ψεῦδη καὶ ὄνειδος τοῖς ἐπιγινομένοις.
**48** Ὅταν γὰρ ἐπέλθῃ ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς πόλεμος καὶ κακά, βουλεύονται πρὸς ἑαυτοὺς οἱ ἱερεῖς, ποῦ

**CHAPTER I.**

**28** ...yet neither to the poor nor to the helpless doth [a wife] impart of their sacrifices, **she** being set apart; and [the wives] do touch women in childbirth.
**29** Knowing therefore from these things that they are no gods, fear ye them not.
**30** For from whence are they called gods? For women do set [food] before gods of silver and of wood; and in their houses the priests do revel,
**31** having their tunics rent, and their heads and their beards shaven, whose heads are uncovered, they do cry aloud
**32** and do cry out before their gods, as some [do] at a funeral feast for a dead man; and the priests, having taken from their own raiment,
**33** do clothe their wives and their children. Neither if they suffer evil from any man, nor if [any] good, shall they be able to recompense; neither
**34** can they set up a king, nor take [one] away; likewise neither wealth nor bronze shall they be able to give. If any man unto them
**35** a vow having vowed, should not repay, they shall in no wise demand [it]. From death a man
**36** shall they in no wise rescue, nor a weaker [man] from a stronger shall they in no wise deliver. A blind man unto sight shall they in no wise bring, nor a man being in distress
**37** shall they in no wise deliver; a widow shall they in no wise pity, nor an orphan do good unto.
**38** To the stones from the mountain are likened the wooden [idols], and the gilded, and the silver-plated; and those who serve them shall be ashamed.
**39** How then ought it to be thought, or to be called, that they are Gods?
**40** Moreover, even the Chaldeans themselves, [while] dishonoring them, who, when they behold a mute man unable to speak, bringing [him] unto Bel, they do then demand that he speak, as [if he were]
**41** able to perceive. And they themselves, having perceived this, cannot abandon them, for they have no understanding.
**42** But the women, having put on cords, do sit down in the streets, perfuming
**43** the bran. And when one of them, being drawn away by one of those who pass by, lieth with her, she doth reproach her neighbor, because she was not deemed worthy as she herself [was], nor was her cord broken.
**44** All the things that are done among them are false; how then ought it to be thought or to be called that they are gods?
**45** For by carpenters and goldsmiths are they made; for nothing else shall they in no wise be, save what the artisans desire them to become.
**46** And they themselves who make them shall in no wise be long-lived.
**47** How then shall the things made by them be gods? For they have left falsehoods and a reproach unto those who come after them.
**48** For when war and evils come upon them, the priests do consult among themselves, [as to] where
