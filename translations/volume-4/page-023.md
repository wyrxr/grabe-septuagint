### THE BOOK OF JUDITH

#### CHAPTER 2

3 And he called together all his servants, and all his great men, and laid before them the secret of his counsel; and he brought to completion all the evil [he decreed] for the land, from his very mouth. And they judged to destroy all flesh which had not hearkened unto the word of his mouth.
4 And it came to pass, when he had finished his counsel, that Nebuchadnezzar, king of the Assyrians, called Holofernes, the chief commander of his army, who was second after him, and said unto him:
5 "Thus saith the great king, the lord of all the earth: Behold, thou shalt go forth from my presence, and shalt take with thee men that trust in their strength, a hundred and twenty thousand footmen, and a multitude of horsemen with their riders, twelve thousand.
6 And thou shalt go forth against all the land toward the west, for they have disobeyed the word of my mouth.
7 And thou shalt declare unto them that they prepare earth and water; for I will go forth in my wrath against them, and will cover all the face of the earth with the feet of my army, and will give them for a spoil unto [my men].
8 And their wounded shall fill their valleys and their torrents; and rivers, overflowing with their dead, shall be filled.
9 And I shall lead their captivity unto the uttermost parts of all the earth.
10 But thou, going forth, shalt seize for me every border of theirs, and they shall surrender themselves unto thee,
11 and thou shalt keep them for me against the day of their reckoning. But upon those that disobey, thine eye shall not spare, so as to give them
12 unto slaughter and to plunder in all thy land. For as I live, and by the might of my kingdom, I have spoken, and I shall do these things with mine own hand.
13 And thou shalt not transgress one of the words of thy lord, but thou shalt diligently perform, just as I have commanded thee,
14 and thou shalt not delay to do them." And Holofernes went forth from the presence of his lord, and called all the potentates,
15 and the generals and commanders of the army of Asshur, and he numbered choice men for battle array, even as his lord had commanded him, to a hundred and twenty thousand, and twelve thousand cavalry archers.
16 And he arrayed them in such a manner as a multitude for war is drawn up.
17 And he took camels, and asses, and mules for their transport, a very great multitude, and sheep and oxen and goats for their provisions, of which there was no number.
