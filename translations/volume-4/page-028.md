Αἰγύπτιοι ἀπὸ προσώπου αὑτῶν. Καὶ κατεξήρανεν ὁ Θεὸς τὴν 13
ἐρυθρὰν θάλασσαν ἔμπροσθεν αὑτῶν, καὶ ἤγαγεν αὑτοὺς εἰς ὁδὸν 14
τοῦ Σινᾶ, καὶ Κάδης Βαρνὴ, καὶ ἐξέβαλον πάντας τοὺς κατοῖ-
κοῦντας ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, καὶ ᾤκησαν ἐν τῇ Ἀμοῤῥαίων, καὶ πάν- 15
τας τοὺς Ἐσεβὼν ἐξωλόθρευσαν ἐν τῇ ἰσχύϊ αὑτῶν· καὶ διαβάντες
τὸν Ἰορδάνην ἐκληρονόμησαν πᾶσαν τὴν ὀρεινὴν καὶ ἐξέβαλον 16
ἐκ προσώπου αὑτῶν τὸν Χαναναῖον, καὶ τὸν Φερεζαῖον, καὶ τὸν
Ἰεβουσαῖον, καὶ τὸν Συχὲμ, καὶ πάντας τοὺς Γεργεσαίους, καὶ
κατώκησαν ἐν αὑτῇ ἡμέρας πολλάς. Καὶ ἕως οὐχ ἥμαρτον ἐνώ- 17
πιον τοῦ Θεοῦ αὑτῶν, ἦν μετ᾽ αὑτῶν τὰ ἀγαθὰ, ὅτι Θεὸς μισῶν
ἀδικίαν μετ᾽ αὑτῶν ἐστίν. Ὅτε δὲ ἀπέστησαν ἀπὸ τῆς ὁδοῦ ἧς 18
διέθετο αὑτοῖς, ἐξωλοθρεύθησαν ἐν πολλοῖς πολέμοις ἐπὶ πολὺ
σφόδρα, καὶ ἠχμαλωτεύθησαν εἰς γῆν οὐκ ἰδίαν, καὶ ὁ ναὸς τοῦ
Θεοῦ αὑτῶν ἐγενήθη εἰς ἔδαφος, καὶ αἱ πόλεις αὑτῶν ἐκρατήθη-
σαν ὑπὸ τῶν ὑπεναντίων. Καὶ νῦν ἐπιστρέψαντες ἐπὶ τὸν Θεὸν 19
αὑτῶν, ἀνέβησαν ἐκ τῆς διασπορᾶς οὗ διεσπάρησαν ἐκεῖ, καὶ κα-
τέσχον τὴν Ἱερουσαλὴμ, οὗ τὸ ἁγίασμα αὑτῶν, καὶ κατώκι-
σθησαν ἐν τῇ ὀρεινῇ, ὅτι ἦν ἔρημος. Καὶ νῦν, δέσποτα κύριε, εἰ 20
μὲν ἐστὶν ἀγνόημα ἐν τῷ λαῷ τούτῳ, καὶ ἁμαρτάνουσιν εἰς τὸν
Θεὸν αὑτῶν, καὶ ἐπισκεψώμεθα ὅ,τι ἐστὶν ἐν αὑτοῖς σκάνδαλον
τοῦτο, καὶ ἀναβησόμεθα, καὶ ἐκπολεμήσομεν αὑτούς. Εἰ δὲ οὐκ 21
ἔστιν ἀνομία ἐν τῷ ἔθνει αὑτῶν, παρελθάτω δὴ ὁ κύριός μου, μὴ
ποτε ὑπερασπίσῃ ὁ Κύριος αὑτῶν καὶ ὁ Θεὸς αὑτῶν ὑπὲρ αὑ-
τῶν, καὶ ἐσόμεθα εἰς ὄνειδος ἐναντίον πάσης τῆς γῆς. Καὶ ἐγέ- 22
νετο ὡς ἐπαύσατο λαλῶν Ἀχιὼρ τοὺς λόγους τούτους, καὶ ἐγόγγυσε
πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ὁ κύκλῳ τῆς σκηνῆς περισσεῶς. καὶ εἶπαν οἱ
μεγιστᾶνες Ὁλοφέρνου, καὶ πάντες οἱ κατοικοῦντες τὴν παρα-
λίαν καὶ τὴν Μωὰβ, συγκόψαι αὑτὸν, οὗ γὰρ φοβηθησόμεθα ἀπὸ 23
υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ· ἰδοὺ γὰρ λαὸς ἐν ᾧ οὐκ ἔστι δύναμις, οὐδὲ κρά-
τος εἰς παράταξιν ἰσχυράν. Διὸ δὴ ἀναβησόμεθα, καὶ ἔσονται εἰς 24
κατάβρωσιν πάσης τῆς στρατιᾶς σου, δέσποτα Ὁλοφέρνη.

                               ΚΕΦ. ς΄. VI.

ΚΑΙ ὡς κατέπαυσεν ὁ θόρυβος τῶν ἀνδρῶν τῶν κύκλῳ τῆς 1
συνεδρίας, καὶ εἶπεν Ὁλοφέρνης ὁ ἀρχιστράτηγος τῆς δυνάμεως

#### CHAPTER 5

12 [And the Egyptians] cast them out from their presence.
13 And God dried up the Red Sea before them, and led them into the way of Sinai, and Kadesh Barnea;
14 and they cast out all them that dwelt in the wilderness, and they dwelt in the land of the Amorites, and utterly destroyed all them of Heshbon by their strength.
15 And having crossed over Jordan, they inherited all the hill country; and they cast out from before their face the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite, and the Shechemite, and all the Girgashites, and they dwelt therein for many days.
16 And so long as they sinned not before their God, good things were with them; for God, Who hateth injustice, is with them.
17 But when they departed from the way which He had appointed for them, they were utterly destroyed in many and exceeding great wars, and were led captive into a land not their own; and the temple of their God was razed to the ground, and their cities were held captive by their adversaries.
18 And now, having returned unto their God, they are come up from the dispersion, whither they were scattered, and have taken possession of Jerusalem, where their sanctuary is;
19 and they have settled in the hill country, for it was a wilderness.
20 And now, O master and lord, if there be indeed an offence in this people, and they sin against their God, and we shall inquire what this stumbling block is in them, then let us go up and make war against them.
21 But if there be no iniquity in their nation, then let my lord, I pray thee, pass by; lest peradventure their Lord and their God defend them, and we become a reproach before all the earth.
22 And it came to pass, when Achior had ceased to speak these words, that all the people round about the tent murmured exceedingly. And the chief men of Holofernes, and all them that dwelt on the seacoast and in Moab, said that he should be cut to pieces,
23 saying, "For wherefore should we fear the children of Israel? For behold, it is a people in whom there is no strength, nor power for a mighty battle array.
24 Therefore shall we indeed go up, and they shall be for a prey unto all thine army, O master Holofernes."

#### CHAPTER 6

1 AND when the clamour of the men round about the council had ceased, Holofernes, the chief captain of the army,
