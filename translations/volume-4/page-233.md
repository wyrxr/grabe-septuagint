**The Wisdom of Solomon.**

**CHAPTER I.**

**1** Love ye righteousness, O ye that judge the earth.
**2** Think ye of the Lord with goodness, and in simplicity of heart seek ye Him. For He is found of them that tempt Him not; and He is made manifest unto them that disbelieve Him not.
**3** For perverse thoughts separate from God; and [His] power, when it is proved, convinceth the unwise.
**4** For into a malicious soul wisdom shall not enter,
**5** Nor shall it dwell in a body enslaved by sin. For the Holy Spirit of discipline will flee deceit, and will depart from thoughts that are without understanding,
**6** And shall be put to the rebuke when unrighteousness cometh in. For the Spirit of Wisdom is loving toward mankind, and will not acquit a blasphemer of his words;
**7** For God is a witness of his reins, and a true overseer of his heart, and a hearer of his tongue. For the Spirit of the Lord hath filled the whole world, and that which holdeth all things together
**8** Hath knowledge of [every] voice. Therefore, he that speaketh unrighteous things shall no wise be hidden,
**9** Nor shall justice pass him by, convicting him. For in the counsels of the ungodly there shall be an inquiry; and the report of his words shall come unto the Lord
**10** For the conviction of his iniquities. For not out of jealousy doth He hear all things,
**11** And the clamour of murmurings is not hidden. Guard yourselves therefore from unprofitable murmuring, and from backbiting restrain your tongue. For a secret, empty utterance shall not pass for naught,
**12** But a false report destroyeth the soul. Desire not death in the error of your life, neither draw ye upon yourselves destruction by the works of your hands.
**13** For God made not death, neither delighteth He in the destruction of the living.
**14** For He created all things that they might be, and the generations of the world are healthful, and there is in them no poison of destruction.
