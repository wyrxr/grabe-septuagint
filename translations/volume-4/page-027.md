1 ΚΑΙ ἀνηγγέλη Ὀλοφέρνῃ ἀρχιστρατήγῳ δυνάμεως Ἀσσοὺρ,
   διότι υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ παρεσκευάσαντο εἰς πόλεμον, καὶ τὰς διόδους
   τῆς ὀρεινῆς συνέκλεισαν, καὶ ἐτείχισαν πᾶσαν κορυφὴν ὄρους
2 ὑψηλοῦ, καὶ ἔθηκαν ἐν τοῖς πεδίοις σκάνδαλα. Καὶ ὠργίσθη θυμῷ
   σφόδρα, καὶ ἐκάλεσε πάντας τοὺς ἄρχοντας Μωάβ, καὶ τοὺς
   στρατηγοὺς υἱοὺς Ἀμμὼν, καὶ πάντας σατράπας τῆς παραλίας,
3 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· ἀναγγείλατε δὴ μοι, υἱοὶ Χαναὰν, τίς ὁ λαὸς
   οὗτος ὁ καθήμενος ἐν τῇ ὀρεινῇ, καὶ τίνες ἃς κατοικοῦσι πόλεις,
   καὶ τὸ πλῆθος τῆς δυνάμεως αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐν τίνι τὸ κράτος αὐτῶν,
   καὶ ἡ ἰσχὺς αὐτῶν, καὶ τίς ἀνέστηκεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτῶν ὁ βασιλεὺς
4 ἡγούμενος στρατείας αὐτῶν; Καὶ διὰ τί κατενωτίσαντο τοῦ μὴ
   ἐλθεῖν εἰς ἀπάντησίν μοι παρὰ πάντας τοὺς κατοικοῦντας ἐν
5 δυσμαῖς; Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτὸν Ἀχιὼρ ὁ ἡγούμενος πάντων υἱῶν
   Ἀμμὼν· ἀκουσάτω δὴ λόγον ὁ κύριός μου ἐκ στόματος τοῦ δού-
   λου σου, καὶ ἀναγγελῶ σοι τὴν ἀλήθειαν περὶ τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου,
   ὅς κατοικεῖ τὴν ὀρεινὴν ταύτην, πλησίον σου οἰκοῦντος, καὶ οὐκ
6 ἐξελεύσεται ψεῦδος ἐκ τοῦ στόματος τοῦ δούλου σου. Ὁ λαὸς
7 οὗτος εἰσὶν ἀπόγονοι Χαλδαίων, καὶ παρῴκησαν τὸ πρότερον ἐν
   τῇ Μεσοποταμίᾳ, ὅτι οὐκ ἐβουλήθησαν ἀκολουθῆσαι τοῖς θεοῖς
8 τῶν πατέρων αὐτῶν, οἱ ἐγένοντο ἐν γῇ Χαλδαίων· καὶ ἐξέβησαν ἐξ
   ὁδοῦ τῶν γονέων αὐτῶν, καὶ προσεκύνησαν τῷ Θεῷ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ,
   Θεῷ ᾧ ἐπέγνωσαν· καὶ ἐξέβαλον αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ προσώπου τῶν θεῶν
   αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔφυγον εἰς Μεσοποταμίαν, καὶ παρῴκησαν ἐκεῖ ἡμέρας
   πολλὰς.
9 Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ Θεὸς αὐτῶν ἐξελθεῖν ἐκ τῆς παροικίας αὐτῶν,
   καὶ πορευθῆναι εἰς γῆν Χαναὰν· καὶ κατῴκησαν ἐκεῖ, καὶ
   ἐπληθύνθησαν χρυσίῳ καὶ ἀργυρίῳ καὶ ἐν κτήνεσι πολλοῖς σφόδρα·
10 καὶ κατέβησαν εἰς Αἴγυπτον, ἐκάλυψε γὰρ τὸ πρόσωπον τῆς γῆς
   Χαναὰν λιμὸς, καὶ παρῴκησαν ἐκεῖ μέχρις οὗ διετράφησαν· καὶ
   ἐγένοντο ἐκεῖ εἰς πλῆθος πολὺ, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἀριθμὸς τοῦ γένους
   αὐτῶν.
11 Καὶ ἐπανέστη αὐτοῖς ὁ βασιλεὺς Αἰγύπτου, καὶ κατεσοφίσατο
   αὐτοὺς, καὶ ἐν πόνῳ καὶ πλίνθῳ ταπείνωσεν αὐτοὺς, καὶ ἔθετο
   αὐτοὺς εἰς δούλους.
12 Καὶ ἀνεβόησαν πρὸς τὸν Θεὸν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπάταξε πᾶσαν τὴν
   γῆν Αἰγύπτου πληγαῖς, ἐν αἷς οὐκ ἦν ἴασις· καὶ ἐξέβαλον αὐτοὺς οἱ

#### CHAPTER 5

1 And it was reported unto Holofernes, the chief captain of the army of Asshur, that the children of Israel had prepared themselves for war, and had shut up the passes of the hill country, and had fortified every high mountain peak,
2 and had laid stumbling blocks in the plains. And he was wroth with exceeding fury, and he called all the rulers of Moab, and the generals of the children of Ammon, and all the satraps of the seacoast,
3 and said unto them, "Declare ye now unto me, O ye children of Canaan, what people is this that dwelleth in the hill country, and what cities they inhabit, and the multitude of their host, and wherein lieth their power, and their strength, and who is the king that hath risen over them, leading their campaign?
4 And wherefore have they turned their backs, refusing to come forth to meet me, contrary to all them that dwell in the west?"
5 And Achior, the leader of all the children of Ammon, said unto him, "Let my lord, I pray thee, hear a word from the mouth of thy servant, and I will declare unto thee the truth concerning this people, which inhabiteth this hill country, dwelling nigh unto thee; and there shall no falsehood proceed from the mouth of thy servant.
6 This people
7 are the descendants of the Chaldeans, and they sojourned aforetime in Mesopotamia, for they would not follow the gods
8 of their fathers, who were in the land of the Chaldeans; and they departed from the way of their parents, and worshipped the God of heaven, the God Whom they had come to know; and [the Chaldeans] cast them out from before their gods, and they fled into Mesopotamia, and sojourned there for many days.
9 And their God commanded them to depart from their sojourning, and to go into the land of Canaan; and they dwelt therein, and were multiplied with gold and with silver, and with very much cattle;
10 and they went down into Egypt, for a famine had covered the face of the land of Canaan, and they sojourned there until they were nourished; and they became there a great multitude, insomuch that the number of their race could not be told.
11 And the king of Egypt rose up against them, and dealt subtly with them, and humbled them with travail and with brickmaking, and made them bond-slaves.
12 And they cried out unto their God, and He smote all the land of Egypt with plagues, wherein there was no healing; and [the Egyptians] cast them out."
