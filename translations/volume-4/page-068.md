ΚΕΦ. Ζ'. VII.
Τότε Σισίννης ὁ ἔπαρχος Κοίλης Συρίας καὶ Φοινίκης, καὶ 1
Σαβραβουζάνης, καὶ οἱ συνεταῖροι κατακολουθήσαντες τοῖς ὑπὸ τοῦ
βασιλέως Δαρείου προσταγεῖσιν, ἐπεστάτουν τῶν ἱερῶν ἔργων, 2
ἐπιμελέστερον συνεργοῦντες τοῖς πρεσβυτέροις τῶν Ἰουδαίων καὶ
ἱεροστάταις. Καὶ εὐόδα ἐγίνετο τὰ ἱερὰ ἔργα, προφητευόντων Ἀγ- 3
γαίου καὶ Ζαχαρίου τῶν προφητῶν. Καὶ συνετέλεσαν ταῦτα διὰ
προστάγματος τοῦ Κυρίου Θεοῦ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ μετὰ τῆς γνώμης 4
Κύρου καὶ Δαρείου καὶ Ἀρταξέρξου βασιλέων Περσῶν, ἕως τοῦ
ἕκτου ἔτους Δαρείου βασιλέως Περσῶν. Συνετελέσθη δ᾽ οἶκος ὁ ἅ- 5
γιος ἕως τρίτης καὶ εἰκάδος μηνός Ἄδαρ τοῦ ἕκτου ἔτους βασιλέως
Δαρείου. Καὶ ἐποίησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς, καὶ οἱ Λευῖ- 6
ται, καὶ οἱ λοιποὶ οἱ ἐκ τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας, οἱ προστεθέντες, ἀκο-
λούθως τοῖς ἐν τῇ Μωσέως βίβλῳ. Καὶ προσήνεγκαν εἰς τὸν ἐγ- 7
καινισμὸν τοῦ ἱεροῦ τοῦ Κυρίου ταύρους ἑκατόν, κριοὺς διακο-
σίους, ἄρνας τετρακοσίους, χιμάρους ὑπὲρ ἁμαρτίας παντὸς τοῦ 8
Ἰσραήλ δώδεκα πρὸς ἀριθμόν, ἐκ τῶν φυλάρχων τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ δώ-
δεκα. Καὶ ἔστησαν οἱ ἱερεῖς καὶ οἱ Λευῖται κατὰ φυλὰς ἐστολι- 9
σμένοι ἐπὶ τῶν ἔργων Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ Ἰσραήλ ἀκολούθως τῇ
Μωσέως βίβλῳ, καὶ οἱ θυρωροὶ ἐφ᾿ ἑκάστου πυλῶνος. Καὶ ἠγάγο- 10
σαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ τῶν ἐκ τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας τὸ πάσχα ἐν τῇ τεσ-
σαρεσκαιδεκάτῃ τοῦ πρώτου μηνός, ὅτε ἡγνίσθησαν οἱ ἱερεῖς καὶ
οἱ Λευῖται ἅμα, καὶ πάντες οἱ υἱοὶ τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας, ἔτι ἡγνί- 11
σθησαν· ὅτι οἱ Λευῖται ἅμα πάντες ἡγνίσθησαν. Καὶ ἔθυσαν τὸ
πάσχα πᾶσι τοῖς υἱοῖς τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας, καὶ τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς αὐ- 12
τῶν τοῖς ἱερεῦσι, καὶ ἑαυτοῖς. Καὶ ἔφαγοσαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ οἱ 13
ἐκ τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας, πάντες οἱ χωρισθέντες ἀπὸ τῶν βδελυγμά-
των τῶν ἐθνῶν τῆς γῆς, ζητοῦντες τὸν Κύριον. Καὶ ἠγάγοσαν 14
τὴν ἑορτὴν τῶν ἀζύμων ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας εὐφραινόμενοι ἔναντι τοῦ
Κυρίου· ὅτι μετέστρεφε τὴν βουλὴν τοῦ βασιλέως Ἀσσυρίων ἐπ᾿ 15
αὐτούς, κατισχύσαι τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τὰ ἔργα Κυρίου Θεοῦ
Ἰσραήλ.

**Chapter 7**

**1** THEN Sisines, the satrap of Coele-Syria and Phoenicia, and Sabrabuzanes, and their companions, having followed the commands that were enjoined by King Darius,
**2** did superintend the holy works, more diligently cooperating with the elders of the Jews and the supervisors of the temple.
**3** And the holy works came to be prosperous, whilst Haggai and Zechariah the prophets did prophesy.
**4** And they finished these things by the commandment of the Lord God of Israel, and with the counsel of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes, kings of Persia,
**5** unto the sixth year of Darius, King of Persia. And the holy house was finished even unto the twenty-third day of the month Adar, in the sixth year of King Darius.
**6** And the children of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, and the rest who [returned] from the captivity, even those who were added [unto them], did [these things] according to the book of Moses.
**7** And they offered for the dedication of the house of the Lord an hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs,
**8** and twelve he-goats for a sin-offering for all Israel, twelve by number, [even] twelve of the phylarchs of Israel.
**9** And the priests and the Levites stood according to their tribes, arrayed for the works of the Lord God of Israel according to the book of Moses; and the doorkeepers were at every gate.
**10** And the children of Israel, they that were of the captivity, kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month, when the priests and the Levites were sanctified together,
**11** and all the children of the captivity; moreover, they were sanctified; for the Levites were all together sanctified.
**12** And they sacrificed the Passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves.
**13** And the children of Israel, they that were of the captivity, did eat, even all them that had separated themselves from the abominations of the nations of the land, seeking the Lord.
**14** And they kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days, rejoicing before the Lord;
**15** for He had turned the counsel of the king of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands for the works of the Lord God of Israel.
