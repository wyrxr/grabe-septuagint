ΣΟΦΙΑ ΙΗΣΟΥ ΣΙΡΑΧ
ΚΕΦ. Αʹ. Βʹ.

23 κρύψει τοὺς λόγους αὐτοῦ, καὶ χείλη πολλῶν ἐκδιηγήσεται σύνεσιν αὐτοῦ.
24 Ἐν θησαυροῖς σοφίας παραβολαὶ ἐπιστήμης· βδέλυγμα δὲ ἁμαρτωλῷ θεοσέβεια.
25 Ἐπιθυμήσας σοφίαν, διατήρησον ἐντολάς, καὶ Κύριος χορηγήσει σοι αὐτήν.
26 Σοφία γὰρ καὶ παιδεία φόβος Κυρίου, καὶ ἡ εὐδοκία αὐτοῦ πίστις καὶ πραΰτης.
27 Μὴ ἀπειθήσῃς φόβῳ Κυρίου ἐνδεὴς ὤν· καὶ μὴ προσέλθῃς αὐτῷ ἐν καρδίᾳ δισσῇ.
28 Μὴ ὑποκριθῇς ἐν στόμασιν ἀνθρώπων, καὶ ἐν τοῖς χείλεσί σου πρόσεχε.
29 Μὴ ἐξυψοῦ σεαυτόν, ἵνα μὴ πέσῃς, καὶ ἐπαγάγῃς τῇ ψυχῇ σου ἀτιμίαν, καὶ ἀποκαλύψει Κύριος τὰ κρυπτά σου, καὶ ἐν μέσῳ συναγωγῆς καταβαλεῖ σε· ὅτι οὐ προσῆλθες ἐν ἀληθείᾳ φόβῳ Κυρίου, καὶ ἡ καρδία σου πλήρης δόλου.

ΚΕΦ. Βʹ. ΙΙ.

1 ΤΕΚΝΟΝ, εἰ προσέρχῃ δουλεύειν Κυρίῳ, ἑτοίμασον τὴν ψυχήν σου εἰς πειρασμόν·
2 εὔθυνον τὴν καρδίαν σου καὶ καρτέρησον, καὶ μὴ σπεύσῃς ἐν καιρῷ ἐπαγωγῆς·
3 κολλήθητι αὐτῷ καὶ μὴ ἀποστῇς, ἵνα αὐξηθῇς ἐπ’ ἐσχάτων σου.
4 Πᾶν δ’ ἐὰν ἐπαχθῇ σοι, δέξαι ἀσμένως, καὶ ἐν ἀλλάγμασι ταπεινώσεώς σου μακροθύμησον·
5 ὅτι ἐν πυρὶ δοκιμάζεται χρυσός, καὶ ἄνθρωποι δεκτοὶ ἐν καμίνῳ ταπεινώσεως.
6 Πίστευσον αὐτῷ καὶ ἀντιλήψεται σου, καὶ εὔθυνον τὰς ὁδούς σου, καὶ ἔλπισον ἐπ’ αὐτόν.
7 Οἱ φοβούμενοι τὸν Κύριον, ἀναμείνατε τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ, καὶ μὴ ἐκκλίνητε ἵνα μὴ πέσητε·
8 οἱ φοβούμενοι Κύριον πιστεύσατε αὐτῷ, καὶ οὐ μὴ πταίσῃ ὁ μισθός ὑμῶν·
9 οἱ φοβούμενοι Κύριον ἐλπίσατε εἰς ἀγαθά, καὶ εἰς εὐφροσύνην αἰῶνος καὶ ἐλέους.
10 Ἐμβλέψατε εἰς ἀρχαίας γενεάς, καὶ ἴδετε· τίς ἐνεπίστευσε Κυρίῳ, καὶ κατησχύνθη;
11 ἢ τίς ἐνέμεινε τῷ φόβῳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐγκατελείφθη; ἢ τίς ἐπεκαλέσατο αὐτόν, καὶ ὑπερεῖδεν αὐτόν;
12 Διότι οἰκτίρμων καὶ ἐλεήμων ὁ Κύριος, μακρόθυμος καὶ πολυέλεος, καὶ ἀφίησιν ἁμαρτίας, καὶ σώζει ἐν καιρῷ θλίψεως.
13 Οὐαὶ καρδίαις δειλαῖς καὶ χερσὶ παρειμέναις, καὶ ἁμαρτωλῷ ἐπιβαίνοντι ἐπὶ δύο τρίβους·
14 οὐαὶ καρδίᾳ παρειμένῃ, ὅτι οὐ πιστεύει· διὰ τοῦτο οὐ σκεπασθήσεται. Οὐαὶ ὑμῖν τοῖς ἀπολωλεκόσι τὴν ὑπομονήν· καὶ τί ποιήσετε ὅταν ἐπισκέπτηται ὁ Κύριος;
15 Οἱ φοβούμενοι Κύριον οὐκ ἀπειθήσουσι ῥημάτων αὐτοῦ, καὶ οἱ ἀγαπῶντες αὐτὸν συντηρήσουσι τὰς ὁδοὺς αὐτοῦ·
16 Οἱ φοβούμενοι Κύριον...

**The Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach**

**Chapter One**

23 For a season shall the long-suffering man endure, and afterward shall He give him gladness; for a season shall he hide his words, and the lips of many shall declare his understanding.
24 In the treasures of wisdom are the parables of knowledge; but godliness is an abomination to a sinner.
25 If thou desirest wisdom, keep the commandments, and the Lord shall bestow her upon thee.
26 For wisdom and instruction is the fear of the Lord; and His good pleasure is faith and meekness.
27 Be not disobedient unto the fear of the Lord when thou art in want; and come not unto Him with a double heart.
28 Feign not in the mouths of men, and be watchful with thy lips.
29 Exalt not thyself, lest thou fall, and bring dishonour upon thy soul; and the Lord shall reveal thy secrets, and in the midst of the congregation shall He cast thee down; because thou camest not unto the fear of the Lord in truth, and thy heart was full of guile.

**Chapter Two**

1 My son, if thou draw nigh to serve the Lord, prepare thy soul for trial;
2 Make thy heart straight and be steadfast, and hasten not in the time of tribulation;
3 Cleave unto Him, and depart not, that thou mayest be increased in thy latter end.
4 And whatsoever shall be brought upon thee, receive gladly, and be long-suffering in the changes of thy humiliation.
5 For gold is tried in the fire, and acceptable men in the furnace of humiliation.
6 Believe in Him, and He shall help thee; and make thy ways straight, and hope in Him.
7 Ye that fear the Lord, await His mercy, and turn not aside, lest ye fall.
8 Ye that fear the Lord, believe Him, and your reward shall not fail.
9 Ye that fear the Lord, hope for good things, and for everlasting gladness and mercy.
10 Look upon the ancient generations, and see: who hath trusted in the Lord, and been put to shame?
11 Or who hath remained steadfast in His fear, and been forsaken? Or who hath called upon Him, and He hath overlooked him?
12 For the Lord is compassionate and merciful, long-suffering and full of mercy, and forgiveth sins, and saveth in the time of tribulation.
13 Woe unto faint-hearted men and unto feeble hands, and unto the sinner that walketh upon two paths!
14 Woe unto the faint heart, for it believeth not; therefore shall it not be covered [or, protected]. Woe unto you that have lost patience! And what shall ye do when the Lord shall visit [you]?
15 They that fear the Lord shall not be disobedient unto His words, and they that love Him shall keep His ways.
16 They that fear the Lord...
