ΚΕΦ. Α΄. Ι.

ΚΑΙ οὗτοι οἱ λόγοι τοῦ βιβλίου, υἱοῦ Μαχχαίου, υἱοῦ Σεδεκίου, υἱοῦ Σαδαίου, υἱοῦ Χελκίου,
ἐν Βαβυλῶνι, ἐν τῷ ἔτει τῷ πέμπτῳ, ἐν ἑβδόμῳ τοῦ μηνός, ἐν
τῷ καιρῷ, ᾧ ἔλαβον οἱ Χαλδαῖοι τὴν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἐνέπρησαν αὐτὴν ἐν πυρί. Καὶ ἀνέγνω Βαροὺχ τοὺς λόγους τοῦ βιβλίου τούτου ἐν ὠσὶν Ἰεχονίου, υἱοῦ Ἰωακεὶμ βασιλέως Ἰούδα,
καὶ ἐν ὠσὶ παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ τῶν ἐρχομένων πρὸς τὴν βίβλον,
καὶ ἐν ὠσὶ τῶν δυνατῶν, καὶ υἱῶν τῶν βασιλέων, καὶ ἐν ὠσὶ
τῶν πρεσβυτέρων, καὶ ἐν ὠσὶ παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ, ἀπὸ μικροῦ ἕως
μεγάλου αὐτῶν πάντων τῶν κατοικούντων ἐν Βαβυλῶνι ἐπὶ τοῦ
ποταμοῦ Σούδ. Καὶ ἔκλαον, καὶ ἐνήστευον, καὶ ηὔχοντο εὐχὰς
ἐναντίον Κυρίου, καὶ συνήγαγον ἀργύριον, καθὰ ἑκάστου ηὐδύνατο ἡ χείρ. Καὶ ἀπέστειλαν εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ πρὸς Ἰωακεὶμ
υἱὸν Χελκίου, υἱοῦ Σαλώμ, τὸν ἱερέα, καὶ πρὸς τοὺς ἱερεῖς, καὶ
πρὸς πάντα τὸν λαόν, τοὺς εὑρεθέντας μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ, ἐν τῷ λαβεῖν αὐτὸν τὰ σκεύη οἴκου Κυρίου, τὰ ἐξενεχθέντα
ἐκ τοῦ ναοῦ, ἀποστρέψαι εἰς γῆν Ἰούδα, τῇ δεκάτῃ τοῦ Σιουάν,
σκευη ἀργυρᾶ, ἃ ἐποίησε Σεδεκίας υἱὸς Ἰωσία βασιλεὺς Ἰούδα,
μετὰ τὸ ἀποικίσαι Ναβουχοδονόσορ βασιλέα Βαβυλῶνος τὸν Ἰεχονίαν, καὶ τοὺς ἄρχοντας, καὶ τοὺς δεσμώτας, καὶ τοὺς δυνατοὺς, καὶ τὸν λαὸν τῆς γῆς ἀπὸ Ἱερουσαλὴμ, καὶ ἤγαγεν αὐτοὺς
εἰς Βαβυλῶνα· καὶ εἶπαν, ἰδοὺ ἀπεστείλαμεν πρὸς ὑμᾶς ἀργύριον, καὶ ἀγοράσατε τοῦ ἀργυρίου ὁλοκαυτώματα καὶ περὶ ἁμαρτίας, καὶ λίβανον, καὶ ποιήσατε μάννα, καὶ ἀνοίσατε ἐπὶ τὸ
θυσιαστήριον Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ὑμῶν, καὶ προσεύξασθε περὶ τῆς
ζωῆς Ναβουχοδονόσορ βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος, καὶ εἰς ζωὴν Βαλτάσαρ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ, ἵνα ὦσιν αἱ ἡμέραι αὐτῶν, ὡς αἱ ἡμέραι τοῦ

**BARUCH**

**CHAPTER I.**

**1** And these are the words of the book, [even of] Baruch, son of Machaios, son of Sedekia, son of Sadaia, son of Chelkia;
**2** [written] in Babylon, in the fifth year, on the seventh day of the month, at such a time as the Chaldeans took Jerusalem, and burned her with fire.
**3** And Baruch did read the words of this book in the ears of Jechonias, the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah,
**4** and in the ears of all the people who came unto the book, and in the ears of the mighty men, and of the sons of the kings, and in the ears of
**5** the elders, and in the ears of all the people, from the least unto the greatest of them all, even all those who dwelt in Babylon by the river Sud.
**6** And they wept, and fasted, and prayed prayers before the Lord; and they gathered silver, according to what each man's hand was able to give.

**10** And they said, "Behold, we have sent unto you silver, and with the silver purchase ye burnt offerings and [offerings] for sin, and frankincense, and prepare a meal-offering, and offer [them] up upon the altar of the Lord your God,
