**22** αὐτῆς, οὐδὲ ἀντελάβοντο αὐτῆς οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτῶν, ἀπὸ τῆς ὁδοῦ αὐ-
**23** τῶν πέῤῥω ἐγενήθησαν, οὐδὲ ἠκούσθη ἐν Χαναάν, οὐδὲ ὤφθη
**24** ἐν Θαιμάν· οὔτε υἱοὶ Ἄγαρ οἱ ἐκζητοῦντες τὴν σύνεσιν οἱ ἐπὶ
**25** τῆς γῆς, οἱ ἔμποροι τῆς Μεῤῥάν, καὶ Θαιμάν, καὶ οἱ μυθολόγοι,
**26** καὶ οἱ ἐκζητηταὶ τῆς συνέσεως ὁδὸν τῆς σοφίας οὐκ ἔγνωσαν,
**27** οὐδὲ ἐμνήσθησαν τὰς τρίβους αὐτῆς. Ὦ Ἰσραήλ, ὡς μέγας ὁ οἶ-
**28** κος τοῦ Θεοῦ; καὶ ἐπιμήκης ὁ τόπος τῆς κτήσεως αὐτοῦ; Μέ-
**29** γας, καὶ οὐχ ἔχει τελευτήν, ὑψηλὸς καὶ ἀμέτρητος. Ἐκεῖ ἐγε-
**30** νήθησαν οἱ γίγαντες οἱ ὀνομαστοὶ οἱ ἀπ᾿ ἀρχῆς γενόμενοι εὐμε-
**31** γέθεις, ἐπιστάμενοι πόλεμον. Οὐ τούτους ἐξελέξατο ὁ Θεός, οὐ-
**32** δὲ ὁδὸν ἐπιστήμης ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἀπώλοντο παρὰ τὸ μὴ
ἔχειν φρόνησιν, ἀπώλοντο διὰ τὴν ἀβουλίαν αὐτῶν. Τίς διέβη
εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν, καὶ ἔλαβεν αὐτήν, καὶ κατεβίβασεν αὐτὴν ἐκ τῶν
νεφελῶν; Τίς διέβη πέραν τῆς θαλάσσης, καὶ εὗρεν αὐτήν, καὶ
οἴσει αὐτὴν χρυσίου ἐκλεκτοῦ; Οὐκ ἔστιν ὁ γινώσκων τὴν ὁδὸν
αὐτῆς, οὐδὲ ὁ ἐνθυμούμενος τὴν τρίβον αὐτῆς. Ἀλλ᾽ ὁ εἰδὼς τὰ
πάντα γινώσκει αὐτήν, ἐξεῦρεν αὐτὴν τῇ συνέσει αὐτοῦ· ὁ κατα-
σκευάσας τὴν γῆν εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα χρόνον, καὶ ἐνέπλησεν αὐτὴν
**33** κτηνῶν τετραπόδων. Ὁ ἀποστέλλων τὸ φῶς· καὶ πορεύεται, ἐκά-
**34** λεσεν αὐτό, καὶ ὑπήκουσεν αὐτῷ τρόμῳ. Οἱ δὲ ἀστέρες ἔλαμψαν
**35** ἐν ταῖς φυλακαῖς αὐτῶν, καὶ εὐφράνθησαν. Ἐκάλεσεν αὐτούς, καὶ
**36** εἶπον· πάρεσμεν, καὶ ἔλαμψαν μετ᾿ εὐφροσύνης τῷ ποιήσαντι αὐ-
**37** τούς. Οὗτος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν, οὐ λογισθήσεται ἕτερος πρὸς αὐτόν.
**38** Ἐξεῦρε πᾶσαν ὁδὸν ἐπιστήμης, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὴν Ἰακὼβ τῷ παιδὶ
**39** αὐτοῦ, καὶ Ἰσραὴλ τῷ ἠγαπημένῳ αὐτοῦ, μετὰ τοῦτο ἐπὶ γῆς
**40** ὤφθη, καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἀνθρώποις συναναστράφη.

**ΚΕΦ. Δ΄.**
**1** ΑΥΤΗ ἡ βίβλος τῶν προσταγμάτων τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ ὁ νόμος
**2** ὁ ὑπάρχων εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα· πάντες οἱ κρατοῦντες αὐτῆς, εἰς ζωὴν
**3** οἱ δὲ καταλείποντες αὐτὴν ἀποθανοῦνται. Ἐπιστρέφου Ἰακώβ,
**4** καὶ ἐπιλαβοῦ αὐτῆς, διόδευσον πρὸς τὴν λάμψιν κατέναντι τοῦ
**5** φωτὸς αὐτῆς. Μὴ δῷς ἑτέρῳ τὴν δόξαν σου, καὶ τὰ συμφέρον-
**6** τά σοι ἔθνει ἀλλοτρίῳ. Μακάριοι ἐσμὲν Ἰσραήλ, ὅτι τὰ ἀρεστὰ
**7** τῷ Θεῷ ἡμῖν γνωστὰ ἐστιν. Θαρσεῖτε, λαός μου, μνημόνευσον

**CHAPTER III.**

**22** her children likewise apprehended her not; they strayed far from her path, neither was she heard of in Canaan, nor seen in Teman.
**24** Neither did the sons of Hagar, who seek understanding upon the earth, the merchants of Merran and of Teman, and the fabulists, and the seekers of understanding, know the way of wisdom, nor remember her paths.
**27** O Israel, how great is the house of God! and how vast is the place of His dominion!
**29** Great it is, and hath no end; high, and immeasurable.
**29** Therein were born the giants, those of renown, who from the beginning were of great stature, skillful in war.
**31** These did God not choose, neither did He give them the way of knowledge; and they perished for lack of understanding, they perished through their own folly.
**32** Who hath scaled the heavens, and taken her, and brought her down from the clouds?
**33** Who hath crossed beyond the sea, and found her, and will bring her for choicest gold?
**33** There is none who knoweth her way, nor any who pondereth her path.
**37** But He that knoweth all things, He knoweth her; He found her by His own understanding; He that fashioned the earth for everlasting time, and filled it with beasts of four feet;
**38** He that sendeth forth the light, and it goeth forth; He called it, and it obeyed Him with trembling.
**39** The stars also shone in their watches, and rejoiced. He called them, and they said, "Here we are!" and they shone with joy for Him that made them.
**40** This is our God, and none other shall be accounted His equal.
**41** He found every way of knowledge, and gave it unto Jacob His servant, and to Israel His beloved.
**42** After this He appeared upon earth, and conversed among men.

**CHAPTER IV.**

**1** This is the book of the commandments of God, even the law that endureth for ever.
**2** All they that cling to her shall have life, but they that forsake her shall die.
**3** Turn you, O Jacob, and take fast hold of her; walk you toward the brightness before her light.
**5** Give not your glory to another, nor your advantages to a strange nation.
**6** Blessed are we, O Israel; for the things that are well-pleasing unto God are made known unto us.
**7** Be of good cheer, my people, remember
