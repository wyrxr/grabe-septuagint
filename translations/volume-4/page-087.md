38 καὶ ἑκατοστοῦ· καὶ διεπέρασε τὸν Εὐφράτην ποταμόν, καὶ διεπορεύετο τὰς ἐπάνω χώρας. Καὶ ἐπέλεξε Λυσίας Πτολεμαῖον τὸν Δορυμένους καὶ Νικάνορα καὶ Γοργίαν ἄνδρας δυνατοὺς τῶν φίλων τοῦ βασιλέως.
39 Καὶ ἀπέστειλε μετ᾽ αὐτῶν τεσσαράκοντα χιλιάδας ἀνδρῶν καὶ ἑπτακισχίλιον ἵππον, τοῦ ἐλθεῖν εἰς γῆν ᾿Ιούδα καὶ καταφθεῖραι αὐτὴν κατὰ τὸν λόγον τοῦ βασιλέως.
40 Καὶ ἀπῆραν σὺν πάσῃ τῇ δυνάμει αὐτῶν καὶ ἦλθον· καὶ παρενέβαλον πλησίον ᾿Αμμαοῦμ ἐν τῇ γῇ τῇ πεδινῇ.
41 Καὶ ἤκουσαν οἱ ἔμποροι τῆς χώρας τὸ ὄνομα αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔλαβον ἀργύριον καὶ χρυσίον πολὺν σφόδρα καὶ πέδας· καὶ ἦλθον εἰς τὴν παρεμβολὴν τοῦ λαβεῖν τοὺς υἱοὺς ᾿Ισραὴλ εἰς παῖδας· καὶ προσεγενήθησαν πρὸς αὐτοὺς δυνάμεις Συρίας καὶ γῆς ἀλλοφύλων.
42 Καὶ ἴδεν ᾿Ιούδας καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ, ὅτι ἐπληθύνθη τὰ κακά, καὶ αἱ δυνάμεις παρεμβάλλουσιν ἐν τοῖς ὁρίοις αὐτῶν· καὶ ἐπέγνωσαν τοὺς λόγους τοῦ βασιλέως οὓς ἐνετείλατο ποιῆσαι τῷ λαῷ εἰς ἀπώλειαν καὶ συντέλειαν.
43 Καὶ εἶπαν ἕκαστος πρὸς τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ· ἀναστήσωμεν τὴν καθαίρεσιν τοῦ λαοῦ ἡμῶν, καὶ πολεμήσωμεν περὶ τοῦ λαοῦ ἡμῶν καὶ τῶν ἁγίων.
44 Καὶ ἠθροίσθησαν ἡ συναγωγὴ τοῦ εἶναι ἑτοίμους εἰς πόλεμον, καὶ τοῦ προσεύξασθαι καὶ αἰτῆσαι ἔλεον καὶ οἰκτιρμούς.
45 Καὶ ᾿Ιερουσαλὴμ ἦν ἀοίκητος ὡς ἔρημος· οὐκ ἦν ὁ εἰσπορευόμενος καὶ ἐκπορευόμενος ἐκ τῶν γεννημάτων αὐτῆς· καὶ τὸ ἁγίασμα καταπατούμενον, καὶ υἱοὶ ἀλλογενῶν ἐν τῇ ἄκρα κατάλυμα ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι· καὶ ἐξήρθη τέρψις ἐξ ᾿Ιακώβ, καὶ ἐξέλιπεν αὐλὸς καὶ κινύρα.
46 Καὶ συνήχθησαν καὶ ἦλθον εἰς Μασσηφὰ κατέναντι ᾿Ιερουσαλήμ, ὅτι τόπος προσευχῆς εἰς Μασσηφὰ τὸ πρότερον τῷ ᾿Ισραήλ.
47 Καὶ ἐνήστευσαν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, καὶ περιεβάλοντο σάκκους καὶ σποδὸν ἐπὶ τὰς κεφαλὰς αὐτῶν, καὶ διέρρηξαν τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτῶν.
48 Καὶ ἐξεπέτασαν τὸ βιβλίον τοῦ νόμου περὶ ὧν ἐξηρεύνων τὰ ἔθνη τὰ ὁμοιώματα τῶν εἰδώλων αὐτῶν.
49 Καὶ ἤνεγκαν τὰ ἱμάτια τῆς ἱερωσύνης, καὶ τὰ πρωτογεννήματα καὶ τὰς δεκάτας· καὶ ἤγειραν τοὺς Ναζιραίους, οἳ ἐπλήρωσαν τὰς ἡμέρας,
50 καὶ ἐβόησαν φωνῇ εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν, λέγοντες· τί ποιήσωμεν τούτοις, καὶ ποῦ αὐτοὺς ἀπαγάγωμεν ;
51 Καὶ τὰ ἅγιά σου καταπεπάτηται, καὶ βεβήλωται· καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς σου ἐν πένθει καὶ ταπεινώσει.
52 Καὶ ἰδοὺ τὰ ἔθνη συνήχται ἐφ᾽ ἡμᾶς τοῦ ἐξᾶραι ἡμᾶς· σὺ οἶδας ἃ λογίζονται ἐφ᾽ ἡμᾶς.

**Chapter 3**

**38** And [it was in the] one hundredth [year]; and he crossed the river Euphrates, and passed through the upper countries. And Lysias chose Ptolemy the son of Dorymenes, and Nicanor, and Gorgias, men mighty amongst the friends of the king.
**39** And he sent with them forty thousand men, and seven thousand horsemen, to come into the land of Judah and destroy it, according to the word of the king.
**40** And they departed with all their host, and came; and encamped nigh unto Emmaus in the plain country.
**41** And the merchants of the country heard their name, and took very much silver and gold, and fetters; and came unto the camp to take the children of Israel for slaves; and there joined unto them forces from Syria and from the land of the foreigners.
**42** And Judas and his brethren saw that the evils were multiplied, and that the hosts did encamp within their borders; and they recognized the words of the king, which he had commanded to do unto the people for destruction and utter ruin.
**43** And each said unto his neighbor, "Let us lift up our people from their desolation, and let us fight for our people and for our holy [places]."
**44** And the congregation gathered themselves together, that they might be ready for war, and that they might pray and ask for mercy and compassions.
**45** And Jerusalem was uninhabited, as a wilderness; neither was there any that went in or went out [from her midst]; and the sanctuary was trampled underfoot, and the sons of strangers [had] in the citadel a dwelling place among the nations; and joy was taken away from Jacob, and the flute and the lyre ceased.
**46** And they gathered together and came unto Mizpah, over against Jerusalem; for in Mizpah was a place of prayer aforetime for Israel.
**47** And they fasted on that day, and clothed themselves with sackcloth and ashes upon their heads, and rent their garments.
**48** And they spread out the Book of the Law, concerning which the Gentiles did search out the likenesses of their idols.
**49** And they brought the garments of the priesthood, and the firstfruits and the tithes; and they raised up the Nazirites, who had fulfilled their days,
**50** and they cried with a voice unto heaven, saying, "What shall we do unto these [things], and whither shall we lead them away?"
**51** "And Thy holy [places] are trampled underfoot, and profaned; and Thy priests [are] in mourning and humiliation."
**52** "And behold, the nations are gathered together against us, to destroy us; Thou knowest what they do plot against us."
