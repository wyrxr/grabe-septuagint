**1.** Τοῖς δὲ ὁσίοις σου μέγιστον ἦν φῶς· ὧν φωνὴν μὲν ἀκούοντες, μορφὴν δὲ οὐχ ὁρῶντες, ὅτι μὲν οὐ κἀκεῖνοι ἐπεπόνθεισαν,

**4.** Ἄξιοι μὲν γὰρ ἐκεῖνοι στερηθῆναι φωτὸς, οἱ φυλακισθῆναι ἐν σκότει, οἱ κατακλείστους φυλάξαντες τοὺς υἱούς σου, δι’ ὧν ἤμελλε τὸ ἄφθαρτον νόμου φῶς τῷ αἰῶνι δίδοσθαι·

**CHAPTER XVII.**

**8** to drive away from a soul that was sick. These did suffer a ridiculous piety.
**9** For even if no delusions did affright them,
**10** yet by the appearances of wild beasts and by the hissing of serpents, being utterly dismayed, they perished in terror, and refusing to look upon the air that could in no wise be fled from. For cowardice,
**11** being condemned by its own wickedness as a witness, and having ever anticipated grievous [things],
**12** being held fast by its conscience. For fear is nothing, save a betrayal of the succours which proceed from reason;
**13** for within, the expectation, being weaker, doth reckon more by shrewdness than the cause which doth afford the torment.
**14** But they who, experiencing the night which was truly impossible, and which had come forth from the innermost recess of Hades, sleeping the selfsame sleep,
**15** were on the one hand driven by monstrous phantoms, and on the other were paralyzed by the betrayal of their soul; for a sudden and unlooked-for fear did come upon them.
**16** And thus, whosoever did fall there, he was held captive, being shut in an ironless prison; for whether he were a husbandman
**17** or a shepherd, or one who laboured in the wilderness with toils, being seized, he did await the necessity that could not be escaped; for by one chain of darkness were they all bound. Whether it were a whistling wind, or a melodious sound of birds among wide-spreading branches, or the rush of water passing by with force,
**18** or the harsh sound of stones falling, or the unlooked-for running of leaping beasts, or the voice of exceedingly fierce beasts roaring, or an echo resounding from the hollows of mountains – these did paralyze them, filling them with terror.
**19** For the whole world was brightly illumined with light,
**20** and was engaged in its works unhindered; but upon them alone was stretched out a heavy night, an image of the darkness which was to receive them; but to themselves they were heavier than darkness.

**CHAPTER XVIII.**

**1** But unto Thy holy ones there was a very great light; whose voice indeed they [the Egyptians] did hear, but whose form they did not behold, [and the holy ones] did deem themselves blessed, that they themselves had not suffered [these things],
**2** and because, being forewarned, they [the Egyptians] did not harm [them], they did give thanks, and
**3** did entreat for grace to pass through. In exchange for which, Thou didst provide a wood aflame with fire, a guide for their unknown journey, and a harmless sun for their noble sojourning.
**4** For those [Egyptians] were indeed worthy to be deprived of light, [and] to be imprisoned in darkness, they who had kept Thy sons confined, through whom the incorruptible light of the Law was to be given unto the world.
