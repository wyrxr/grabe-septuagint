ΠΡΟΛΟΓΟΣ

ΠΟΛΛΩΝ καὶ μεγάλων ἡμῖν διὰ τοῦ νόμου καὶ τῶν προφητῶν καὶ τῶν ἄλλων τῶν κατ᾽ αὐτοὺς ἠκολουθηκότων δεδομένων, ὑπὲρ ὧν δέον ἐστὶν ἐπαινεῖν τὸν Ἰσραὴλ παιδείας καὶ σοφίας, καὶ ὡς οὐ μόνον αὐτοὺς τοὺς ἀναγινώσκοντας δέον ἐστὶν ἐπισήμους γίνεσθαι, ἀλλὰ καὶ τοῖς ἐκτὸς δύνασθαι τοὺς φιλομαθοῦντας χρησίμους εἶναι καὶ λέγοντας καὶ γράφοντας· ὁ πάππος μου Ἰησοῦς ἐπὶ πλεῖον ἑαυτὸν δοὺς εἴς τε τὴν νόμου καὶ τῶν προφητῶν καὶ τῶν ἄλλων πατρίων βιβλίων ἀνάγνωσιν, καὶ ἐν τούτοις ἱκανὴν ἕξιν περιποιησάμενος, προήχθη καὶ αὐτὸς συγγράψαι τι τῶν εἰς παιδείαν καὶ σοφίαν ἀνηκόντων, ὅπως οἱ φιλομαθεῖς καὶ τούτων ἔνηχοι γενόμενοι, πολλῷ μᾶλλον ἐπιπροσθῶσι διὰ τῆς ἐννόμου βιώσεως. Παρεκέκλησθε οὖν μετ᾽ εὐνοίας καὶ προσοχῆς τὴν ἀνάγνωσιν ποιεῖσθαι, καὶ συγγνώμην ἔχειν ἐφ᾽ οἷς ἂν δοκῶμεν τῶν κατὰ τὴν ἑρμηνείαν περιπονημένων τισὶ τῶν λέξεων ἀδυναμεῖν· οὐ γὰρ ἰσοδυναμεῖ αὐτὰ ἐν ἑαυτοῖς Ἑβραϊστὶ λεγόμενα, καὶ ὅταν μεταχθῇ εἰς ἑτέραν γλῶσσαν· οὐ μόνον δὲ ταῦτα, ἀλλὰ καὶ αὐτὸς ὁ νόμος, καὶ αἱ προφητεῖαι, καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν βιβλίων οὐ μικρὰν ἔχει τὴν διαφορὰν ἐν ἑαυτοῖς λεγόμενα. Ἐν γὰρ τῷ ὀγδόῳ καὶ τριακοστῷ ἔτει ἐπὶ τοῦ Εὐεργέτου βασιλέως παραγενηθεὶς εἰς Αἴγυπτον, καὶ συγχρονίσας, εὑρὼν οὐ μικρᾶς παιδείας ἐφόδιον, ἀναγκαιότατον ἐθέμην καὶ αὐτὸς τινα προσενέγκασθαι σπουδὴν καὶ φιλοπονίαν τοῦ μεθερμηνεῦσαι τὴν δὲ τὴν βίβλον, πολλὴν ἀγρυπνίαν καὶ ἐπιστήμην προσενεγκάμενος ἐν τῷ διασήματι τοῦ χρόνου, πρὸς τὸ ἐπὶ πέρας ἀγαγόντα τὸ βιβλίον ἐκδόσθαι καὶ τοῖς ἐν τῇ παροικίᾳ βουλομένοις φιλομαθεῖν, προκατασκευαζομένους τὰ ἤδη ἐννόμως βιοτεύειν.

**The Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach**

**The Prologue**

Forasmuch as many and great things have been delivered unto us by the Law, and the Prophets, and by others that have followed their steps, for the which it is meet to praise Israel for their doctrine and their wisdom; and as it is necessary not only for those who read them themselves to become notable, but also for those outside [our people], who are lovers of learning, to be able to be useful, both in speaking and in writing:

My grandfather, Jesus, having given himself much to the reading of the Law, and the Prophets, and the other ancestral books, and having gained sufficient skill therein, was moved also himself to write somewhat pertaining to doctrine and wisdom; that they which are desirous to learn, and are well-versed in these things, might profit much more through a life of lawfulness.

Ye are therefore exhorted to make the reading with favour and attention, and to grant pardon for such things wherein we may seem to be deficient concerning some of the words which have been diligently wrought in the interpretation; for the very words spoken in Hebrew bear not the same power within themselves, even as when they are translated into another tongue. Moreover, not only these things, but also the Law itself, and the Prophets, and the other books, have no small difference when they are read in their own [tongues].

For in the thirty-eighth year of the reign of Euergetes the King, after I had come into Egypt, and had tarried there a long time, I found no small store of instruction. I thought it therefore most necessary also myself to bestow some diligence and labour to translate this selfsame book, having applied much sleeplessness and knowledge during the course of that time, to the end that the book, having been brought to a conclusion, might be published even for them that dwell in the dispersion and are desirous to learn, who are thereby preparing themselves for [that which is] already lawful living.
