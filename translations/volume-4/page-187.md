44 νων καταστήσειν. Τότε περιχαρείς ἀναλύσαντες οἱ φίλοι καὶ συγ-
γενεῖς μετὰ πίστεως, διέτασσον τὰς δυνάμεις ἐπὶ τοὺς εὐκαιρο-
45 τάτους τόπους τῆς πόλεως πρὸς τὴν τήρησιν. Ὁ δὲ ἐλεφαν-
τάρχης τὰ θηρία σχεδὸν, ὡς εἰπεῖν, εἰς κατάστημα μανιῶδες
ἀγχώσας, εὐωδεστάτοις πόμασιν οἴνου λελιβανωμένου φοβερῶς
46 κεκοσμημένα κατασκευαῖς, περὶ τὴν ἕω, τῆς πόλεως ἤδη πλήθε-
σιν ἀναριθμήτοις κατὰ τοῦ ἱπποδρόμου καταμεμεστωμένης, εἰσελ-
47 θὼν εἰς τὴν αὐλὴν ἐπὶ τὸ προκείμενον ὤτρυνε τὸν βασιλέα. Ὁ
δὲ ὀργῇ βαρέᾳ γεμίσας δυσσεβῆ φρένα, παντὶ τῷ βάρει σὺν τοῖς
θηρίοις ἐξώρμησε, βουλόμενος ἀτρέπτῳ καρδίᾳ καὶ κόραις ὀφθαλ-
μῶν θεάσασθαι τὴν ἐπίπονον καὶ ταλαίπωρον τῶν προσεσημαμ-
48 μένων καταστροφήν. Ὡς δὲ τῶν ἐλεφάντων ἐξιόντων περὶ πύλην,
καὶ τῆς ἑπομένης ἐνόπλου δυνάμεως, τῆς τε τοῦ πλήθους πορείας
κονιστὸν ἰδόντες, καὶ βαρυηχῆ θόρυβον ἀκούσαντες οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι,
49 ὑστάτην βίου ῥοπὴν αὐτοῖς ἐκείνην δόξαντες εἶναι τὸ τέλος τῆς
ἀθλιωτάτης προσδοκίας, εἰς οἶκτον καὶ γόους τραπέντες, κα-
τεφίλουν ἀλλήλους, περιπλεκόμενοι τοῖς συγγενέσιν, ἐπὶ τοὺς τρα-
χήλους ἐπιπίπτοντες, γονεῖς παισὶ καὶ μητέρες νεάνισιν· ἕτεραι
δὲ νεογνὰ πρὸς μαστοὺς ἔχουσαι βρέφη τελευταῖον ἕλκοντα γάλα.
50 Οὐ μὴν δὲ ἀλλὰ καὶ τὰς ἔμπροσθεν αὐτῶν γεγενημένας ἀντιλή-
ψεις ἐξ οὐρανοῦ συνιδόντες, πρηνεῖς ὁμοθυμαδὸν ῥίψαντες ἑαυτούς,
51 καὶ τὰ νήπια χωρίσαντες τῶν μαστῶν, ἀνεβόησαν φωνῇ μεγάλῃ
σφόδρα, τὸν τῆς ἁπάσης δυνάστην ἱκετεύοντες, οἰκτεῖραι μετὰ
ἐπιφανείας αὐτοὺς ἤδη πρὸς πύλαις ᾅδου καθεστῶτας.

1 ἙΛΕΑΖΑΡΟΣ δέ τις ἀνὴρ ἐπίσημος τῶν ἀπὸ τῆς χώρας
ἱερέων ἐν πρεσβείῳ τὴν ἡλικίαν ἤδη λελογχώς, καὶ πάσῃ τῇ κα-
τὰ τὸν βίον ἀρετῇ κεκοσμημένος, τοὺς περὶ αὐτὸν καταστείλας
πρεσβυτέρους ἐπικαλεῖσθαι τὸν ἅγιον Θεόν, καὶ προσηύξατο τάδε·
2 Βασιλεῦ μεγαλοκράτωρ, ὕψιστε, παντοκράτωρ Θεὲ, τὴν πᾶσαν
3 διακυβερνῶν ἐν οἰκτιρμοῖς κτίσιν, ἔπιδε ἐπὶ Ἀβραὰμ σπέρμα,
ἐπ’ ἡγιασμένου τέκνα Ἰακὼβ, μερίδος ἡγιασμένης σου λαὸν ἐν
4 ξένῃ γῇ ξένον ἀδίκως ἀπολλύμενον, πάτερ. Σὺ Φαραὼ πληθύ-
νοντα ἅρμασι τὸν πρὶν Αἰγύπτου ταύτης δυνάστην ἐπαρθέντα

**III Maccabees, Chapter 5**

**44** Then the friends and kinsmen, departing full of exceeding joy and with faith, did array the forces in the most opportune places of the city for the [purpose of] guarding.
**45** And the elephant-master, having well-nigh, as it were, urged the beasts into a state of madness, they being terribly arrayed with devices and with most fragrant drinks of frankincensed wine,
**46** then, about the dawn, the city being already filled with innumerable throngs at the hippodrome, he entered into the courtyard and did urge the king concerning the matter set before them.
**47** But he, having filled his impious mind with grievous wrath, did rush forth with all his might, together with the beasts, desiring with an unwavering heart and with the pupils of his eyes to behold the grievous and wretched destruction of those who had been marked for doom.
**48** And as the elephants went forth near the gate, and as the armed force did follow, and when the Jews beheld the dusty march of the multitude, and heard the heavy-sounding tumult,
**49** supposing that this was for them the last turn of life, and the end of their most wretched expectation, they turned themselves unto lamentation and weeping; they kissed one another, embracing their kinsmen, falling upon their necks, even parents upon their children and mothers upon young maidens;
**50** whilst others, having newborn infants at their breasts, did suffer them to draw milk for the last time. Yet not only so, but also having perceived the former assistances from heaven that had been wrought for them, they cast themselves down prostrate with one accord,
**51** and having parted the infants from their breasts, they cried out with a very great voice, imploring the Ruler of all things, that He would, with a manifestation [of His power], take pity upon them, who were already standing at the gates of Hades.

**Chapter 6**

**1** Now a certain Eleazar, a distinguished man among the priests from the country, having already attained an advanced age, and adorned with every virtue in his life, having exhorted the elders around him to call upon the holy God, did then pray thus:
**2** "O King, Most Mighty, O Most High, O Almighty God,
**3** Who governest all creation with mercies, look down upon the seed of Abraham, upon the children of Jacob, Thy sanctified [one], upon a people of Thy hallowed portion,
**4** [a people] perishing unjustly as strangers in a foreign land, O Father. Thou [didst bring low] Pharaoh, the former ruler of this Egypt, who was lifted up and abounded in chariots,"
