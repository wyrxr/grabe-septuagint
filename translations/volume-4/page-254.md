ΚΕΦ. ΙΗʹ.
βουλευσαμένους δ᾽ αὐτοὺς τὰ τῶν **ὁσίων** ἀποκτεῖναι νήπια, καὶ 5
ἑνὸς ἐκτεθέντος τέκνου καὶ σωθέντος, εἰς ἔλεγχον τὸ αὐτῶν ἀφεί-
λου πλῆθος τέκνων, καὶ ὁμοθυμαδὸν ἀπώλεσας ἐν ὕδατι σφοδρῷ.
Ἐκείνη ἡ νὺξ προεγνώσθη πατράσιν ἡμῶν, ἵνα ἀσφαλῶς εἰδότες 6
οἷς ἐπίστευσαν ὅρκοις, ἐπευθυμήσωσι, προσδεχθῇ δὲ ὑπὸ λαοῦ σου 7
σωτηρία μὲν δικαίων, ἐχθρῶν δὲ ἀπώλεια· **ᾧ** γὰρ ἐτιμωρήσω τοὺς 8
ὑπεναντίους, **τούτῳ** ἡμᾶς παρακαλεσάμενος ἐδόξασας. Κρυφῇ γὰρ 9
ἐθυσίαζον ὅσιοι παῖδες ἀγαθῶν, καὶ τὸν τῆς θειότητος νόμον ἐν
ὁμονοίᾳ διέθεντο, τῶν αὐτῶν ὁμοίως καὶ ἀγαθῶν καὶ κινδύνων
μεταλήψεσθαι τοὺς ἁγίους, πατέρων ἤδη προαναμέλποντες αἴνους.
Ἀντήχει δὲ ἀσύμφωνος ἐχθρῶν βοή, καὶ οἰκτρὰ διεφέρετο φωνὴ 10
θρηνουμένων παίδων. Ὁμοίᾳ δὲ δίκη δοῦλος ἅμα δεσπότῃ κο- 11
λασθείς, καὶ δημότης βασιλεῖ τὰ αὐτὰ πάσχων· ὁμοθυμαδὸν δὲ 12
πάντες ἐν ἑνὶ ὀνόματι θανάτου νεκροὺς εἶχον ἀναριθμήτους· οὐ-
δὲ γὰρ πρὸς τὸ θάψαι οἱ ζῶντες ἦσαν ἱκανοί, ἐπεὶ πρὸς μίαν ῥο-
πὴν ἡ ἐντιμοτέρα γένεσις αὐτῶν διεφθάρτο. Πάντα γὰρ ἀπι- 13
στόντες διὰ τὰς φαρμακίας, ἐπὶ τῷ τῶν πρωτοτόκων ὀλέθρῳ
ὡμολόγησαν Θεοῦ υἱὸν λαὸν εἶναι. Ἡσύχου γὰρ σιγῆς περιε- 14
χούσης τὰ πάντα, καὶ νυκτὸς ἐν ἰδίῳ τάχει μεσαζούσης, ὁ παν- 15
τοδύναμός σου λόγος ἀπ᾽ οὐρανῶν ἐκ θρόνων βασιλείων ἀπότο-

**CHAPTER XVIII.**

**5** but when they had purposed to slay the infants of Thy holy ones, and when one child had been cast forth and saved, Thou didst take away the multitude of their own children as a rebuke, and with one accord didst destroy them in violent water.
**6** That night was made known beforehand unto our fathers, that, knowing securely in what oaths they had trusted, they might be of good cheer,
**7** and that salvation for the righteous, but destruction for the enemies, might be welcomed by Thy people;
**8** for by that by which Thou didst punish the adversaries, by that didst Thou glorify us, having comforted us.
**9** For in secret did the holy children offer sacrifice of good things, and in concord did they establish the law of the divine nature, that the saints should in like manner partake of the same good things and dangers, already chanting the praises of the fathers.
**10** But there did echo back the discordant cry of enemies, and piteous did resound the voice of children lamenting.
**11** And by a like judgment were servant and master punished together, and commoner with king did suffer the same things;
**12** and with one accord did all possess innumerable dead by one name of death; for neither were the living sufficient to bury [them], since in one moment their more honoured offspring was utterly destroyed.
**13** For having disbelieved all things because of their enchantments, upon the destruction of the firstborn they did confess that the people was the Son of God.

**16** and bearing Thy unfeigned command as a sword, and having filled all things with death; and while it did touch the heaven, it did walk upon the earth.
**17** Then straightway phantoms of dreadful dreams did trouble them, and unlooked-for fears did come upon them;
**18** and one, being cast down here and there half-dead, did manifest the cause for which he was dying.
**19** For the dreams, having troubled them, did signify this beforehand, lest, being ignorant for what cause they suffered ill, they should perish.
**20** But a trial of death did touch even the righteous, and a breaking forth of the multitude did come to pass in the wilderness; yet did not the wrath abide for long.
**21** For a blameless man, having hastened, did fight on their behalf, bringing the weapon of his own ministry, [even] prayer and the propitiation of incense; he stood against the wrath, and did set an end to the calamity, showing that he is Thy servant.
**22** And he overcame the multitude not by strength of body, nor by the efficacy of weapons, but by a word did he subdue the one who punished, bringing to remembrance the oaths of the fathers and the covenants.
**23** For while the dead were already fallen in heaps, one upon another, having stood in the midst, he did cut off the wrath,
