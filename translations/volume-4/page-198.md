νους ὢν τοῖς τοῦ βασιλέως πράγμασιν ἥκω, μηνύσων πολλὰς ἰδιω- 3
τικῶν χρημάτων μυριάδας ἐν τοῖς Ἱεροσολύμων γαζοφυλακίοις
τεθησαυρίσθαι, τῷ ἱερῷ μὴ ἐπικονοῦντας, καὶ προσήκειν ταῦτα
Σελεύκῳ τῷ βασιλεῖ. Τούτων δὲ ἕκαστα γνοὺς ὁ Ἀπολλώνιος, 4
τὸν μὲν Σίμωνα τῆς εἰς τὸν βασιλέα κηδεμονίας ἐπήνει, πρὸς δὲ
τὸν Σέλευκον ἀναβὰς κατεμήνυε τὸν τῶν χρημάτων θησαυρόν·
καὶ λαβὼν τὴν περὶ αὐτῶν ἐξουσίαν, ταχὺ εἰς τὴν πατρίδα ἡμῶν 5
μετὰ τοῦ καταράτου Σίμωνος καὶ βαρυτάτου στρατοῦ ἀνέβη. Καὶ 6
προσελθών, ἔλεγεν ἔπως τὰ ἰδιωτικὰ τοῦ γαζοφυλακίου λάβοι χρήματα. Καὶ τοῦ ἔθνους πρὸς 7
τὸν λόγον σχετλιάζοντος, ἀντιλέγοντός τε, πάνδεινον εἶναι νομί-
σαντες, εἰ οἱ τὰς παρακαταθήκας πιστεύσαντες τῷ ἱερῷ θησαυρῷ
στερηθήσονται, ὡς οἷόν τε ἦν, ἐκώλυσν. Μετὰ ἀπειλῆς δὲ ὁ 8
Ἀπολλώνιος ἀπῄει εἰς τὸ ἱερόν. Τῶν δὲ ἱερέων μετὰ γυναικῶν 9
καὶ παιδίων ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ ἱκετευσάντων τῷ Θεῷ ὑπερασπίσαι τοῦ
ἱεροῦ καταφρονουμένου τοῦ τόπου. Ἀνιόντος τε μετὰ καθωπλι- 10
σμένης τῆς στρατιᾶς τοῦ Ἀπολλωνίου πρὸς τὴν τῶν χρημάτων
ἁρπαγήν, οὐρανόθεν ἔφιπποι προσφάνησαν ἄγγελοι περιαστρά-
πτοντες τοῖς ὅπλοις, καὶ πολὺν αὐτοῖς φόβον τε καὶ τρόμον ἐνιόν-
τες. Καταπεσὼν δὲ ἡμιθανὴς ὁ Ἀπολλώνιος ἐπὶ τὸν πάμφυ- 11
λον τοῦ ἱεροῦ περίβολον, τὰς χεῖρας ἐξέτεινεν εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν,
καὶ μετὰ δακρύων τοὺς Ἑβραίους παρεκάλει, ὅπως περὶ αὑτοῦ
εὐξόμενοι, τὸν ἐπουράνιον ἐξευμενίσωνται στρατόν. Ἔλεγεν γὰρ 12
ἡμαρτηκώς, ὥστε καὶ ἀποθανεῖν ἄξιος ὑπάρχειν, πάσιν τε ἀνθρώ-
ποις ὑμνήσειν σωθεὶς τὴν τοῦ ἱεροῦ τόπου μακαριότητα. Τού- 13
τοις ἐπαχθεὶς τοῖς λόγοις Ὀνίας ὁ ἀρχιερεύς, καίπερ ἄλλως εὐ-
λαβηθείς, μή ποτε νομίσειεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Σέλευκος ἐξ ἀνθρωπίνης
ἐπιβουλῆς καὶ μὴ Θείας δίκης ἀνηρῆσθαι τὸν Ἀπολλώνιον, ηὔ-
ξατο περὶ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ὁ μὲν παραδόξως διασωθεὶς ὤιχετο, δη- 14
λώσων τῷ βασιλεῖ τὰ συμβάντα αὑτῷ. Τελευτήσαντος δὲ Σελεύκου 15
τοῦ βασιλέως, διαδέχεται τὴν ἀρχὴν ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ Ἀντίοχος Ἐπι-
φανής, ἀνὴρ ὑπερήφανος καὶ δεινός. Ὅς καταλύσας τὸν Ὀνίαν 16
τῆς ἀρχιερωσύνης, Ἰάσονα τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὑτοῦ κατέστησεν ἀρχιε-
ρέα, συνθέμενον δώσειν, εἰ ἐπιτρέψειεν αὑτῷ τὴν ἀρχήν, κατ᾿ 17
ἐνιαυτὸν τρισχίλια ἑξακόσια ἑξήκοντα τάλαντα. Ὁ δὲ ἐπέτρε- 18

**CHAPTER IV.**

**3** [Being] well-disposed unto the affairs of the king, I am come to disclose that many tens of thousands of private moneys are laid up in the treasuries of Jerusalem, which do not pertain unto the Temple, and that these do rightly belong unto Seleucus the king.”
**4** Now Apollonius, having come to know each of these matters, did praise Simon for his care towards the king; and going up unto Seleucus, he did disclose the treasure of the moneys.
**5** And having received authority concerning these matters, he swiftly came unto our native land
**6** with that accursed Simon and a very heavy army. And drawing nigh, he declared that he was come so that he might take the private moneys of the treasury.
**7** And the nation, grievously lamenting and speaking against his word, did reckon it a most dire thing, should they be deprived, who had entrusted their deposits unto the sacred treasury; and as much as was possible, they did hinder him.
**8** But Apollonius, with threats, did depart unto the Temple.
**9** And the priests, with their wives and children, within the Temple, did supplicate God to be a shield unto the Temple, seeing the place was despised.
**10** And as Apollonius ascended with his army fully armed, to seize the moneys,
**11** from heaven did there appear angels on horseback, flashing with their weapons, and casting much fear and trembling upon them. And Apollonius, falling down half-dead upon the spacious court of the Temple, did stretch forth his hands unto heaven,
**12** and with tears did he beseech the Hebrews, that praying for him, they might propitiate the heavenly host. For he did declare that he had sinned, so that he was worthy even to die, and that, if saved, he would hymn unto all men the blessedness of the holy place.
**13** And Onias the high priest, being moved by these words, albeit he was otherwise circumspect, lest king Seleucus should ever suppose that Apollonius had been slain by human stratagem and not by divine justice, yet did he pray for him.
**14** And he, having been wondrously saved, departed, to declare unto the king the things which had befallen him.
**15** Now when Seleucus the king had departed this life, his son Antiochus Epiphanes did succeed to the dominion, a man exceeding proud and terrible.
**16** Who, having removed Onias from the high priesthood, did appoint Jason, his own brother, as high priest,
**17** upon his agreeing to give, if he would permit him the rule, three thousand six hundred and sixty talents each year.
**18** And he did permit him both to act as high priest and to lead the nation.
**19** Who also...
