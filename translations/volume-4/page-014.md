ἵνα ἐλεήσῃ ὁ Κύριος ἡμᾶς. Καὶ ἤρξατο Τωβίας λέγειν· εὐλογητὸς 8:5
εἰ ὁ Θεὸς τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν, καὶ εὐλογητὸν τὸ ὄνομά σου τὸ
ἅγιον καὶ ἔνδοξον εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας· εὐλογησάτωσάν σε οἱ οὐρανοί,
καὶ πᾶσαι αἱ κτίσεις σου. Σὺ ἐποίησας Ἀδάμ, καὶ ἔδωκας αὐτῷ 8:6
βοηθὸν Εὔαν στήριγμα τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ. ἐκ τούτων ἐγενήθη τὸ
ἀνθρώπων σπέρμα. σὺ εἶπας, οὐ καλὸν εἶναι τὸν ἄνθρωπον μόνον,
ποιήσωμεν βοηθὸν ὅμοιον αὐτῷ. Καὶ νῦν, Κύριε, οὐ διὰ πορνείαν 8:7
ἐγὼ λαμβάνω τὴν ἀδελφήν μου ταύτην, ἀλλὰ ἐπ᾽ ἀληθείας·
ἐπίταξον ἐλεῆσαί με, καὶ ταύτῃ συγκαταγηρᾶσαι! Καὶ εἶπε μετ᾿ 8:8
αὐτοῦ, ἀμήν. Καὶ ἐκοιμήθησαν ἀμφότεροι τὴν νύκτα· καὶ ἀνα- 8:9
στὰς Ῥαγουὴλ ἐπορεύθη, καὶ ὤρυξε τάφον, λέγων· μὴ καὶ αὐ- 8:10
τὸς ἀποθάνῃ; Καὶ ἦλθε Ῥαγουὴλ εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν ἑαυτοῦ, καὶ εἶ- 8:11
πεν Ἔδια τῇ γυναικὶ αὐτοῦ· ἀπόστειλον μίαν τῶν παιδισκῶν, 8:12
καὶ ἰδέτωσαν εἰ ζῇ· εἰ δὲ μή, ἵνα θάψωμεν αὐτόν, καὶ μηδεὶς
γνώτῳ. Καὶ εἰσῆλθεν ἡ παιδίσκη ἀνοίξασα τὴν θύραν, καὶ εὗρε 8:13
τοὺς δύο καθεύδοντας. Καὶ ἐξελθοῦσα ἀπήγγειλεν αὐτοῖς, ὅτι 8:14
ζῇ. Καὶ ηὐλόγησε Ῥαγουὴλ τὸν Θεόν, λέγων· εὐλογητὸς εἶ σὺ 8:15
ὁ Θεὸς ἐν πάσῃ εὐλογίᾳ καθαρᾷ καὶ ἁγίᾳ καὶ εὐλογείτωσάν σε
οἱ ἅγιοί σου, καὶ πᾶσαι αἱ κτίσεις σου, καὶ πάντες οἱ ἄγγελοί
σου, καὶ οἱ ἐκλεκτοί σου· εὐλογείτωσάν σε εἰς πάντας τοὺς αἰῶνας.
Εὐλογητὸς εἶ, ὅτι ηὔφρανάς με, καὶ οὐκ ἐγένετό μοι καθώς 8:16
ὑπενόουν, ἀλλὰ κατὰ τὸ πολὺ ἔλεός σου ἐποίησας μεθ᾽ ἡμῶν.
Εὐλογητὸς εἶ, ὅτι ἠλέησας δύο μονογενεῖς· ποίησον αὐτοῖς, δέ- 8:17
σποτα, ἔλεος, συντέλεσον τὴν ζωὴν αὐτῶν ἐν ὑγείᾳ μετ᾿ εὐφρο-
σύνης καὶ ἐλέους. Ἐκέλευσε δὲ τοῖς οἰκέταις χῶσαι τὸν τάφον· 8:18
καὶ ἐποίησεν αὐτοῖς γάμον ἡμερῶν δεκατεσσάρων. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐ- 8:19
τῷ Ῥαγουὴλ, πρὶν συντελεσθῆναι τὰς ἡμέρας τοῦ γάμου, ἐνόρ- 8:20
κως, μὴ ἐξελθεῖν αὐτὸν ἐὰν μὴ πληρωθῶσιν αἱ δεκατέσσαρες ἡ-
μέραι τοῦ γάμου. Καὶ τότε λαβόντα τὸ ἥμισυ τῶν ὑπαρχόντων 8:21
αὐτοῦ πορεύεσθαι μετὰ ὑγείας πρὸς τὸν πατέρα, καὶ τὰ λοιπά,
ὅταν ἀποθάνω, καὶ ἡ γυνή μου.

### CHAPTER 8

[Tobit 8:5]
...that the Lord may have mercy upon us. And Tobias began to say:
"Blessed art Thou, O God of our fathers, and blessed is Thy holy and glorious Name unto the ages; let the heavens bless Thee, and all Thy creatures.

[Tobit 8:6]
Thou didst create Adam, and gavest unto him Eve as a helper, his wife as a support; from these came forth the seed of mankind. Thou didst say, 'It is not good for man to be alone; let Us make him a helper like unto himself.'

[Tobit 8:7]
And now, O Lord, I take not this my sister for the sake of fornication, but in truth [and sincerity]; grant that Thou have mercy upon me, and that I may grow old with her."

[Tobit 8:8]
And she said with him, "Amen."

[Tobit 8:9]
And they both lay down to sleep that night. And Raguel arose and went, and he dug a grave, saying,

[Tobit 8:10]
"Lest he also perish?"

[Tobit 8:11]
And Raguel came into his house, and said unto Edia his wife,

[Tobit 8:12]
"Send forth one of the maidservants, and let them see if he liveth; but if not, that we may bury him, and let no man know [it]."

[Tobit 8:13]
And the maidservant went in, and opened the door, and found them both sleeping.

[Tobit 8:14]
And going forth, she reported unto them that he lived.

[Tobit 8:15]
And Raguel blessed God, saying, "Blessed art Thou, O God, with all pure and holy blessing; and let Thy saints bless Thee, and all Thy creatures, and all Thine angels, and Thine elect ones; let them bless Thee unto all the ages.

[Tobit 8:16]
Blessed art Thou, for Thou hast made me glad, and it hath not befallen me as I had surmised, but according to Thy great mercy hast Thou dealt with us.

[Tobit 8:17]
Blessed art Thou, for Thou hast had mercy on two only-begotten [children]; O Lord, show mercy unto them, complete their life in health, with gladness and with mercy."

[Tobit 8:18]
And he commanded his servants to fill up the grave. And he made for them a wedding feast of fourteen days.

[Tobit 8:19]
And Raguel said unto him, before the days of the wedding were completed,

[Tobit 8:20]
under oath, that he should not depart unless the fourteen days of the nuptial feast were fulfilled.

[Tobit 8:21]
And then, taking half of his [Raguel's] possessions, that he should go in good health unto his father; and the remainder thereof [shall be theirs] when I and my wife shall die.

### CHAPTER 9

[Tobit 9:1]
AND Tobias called Raphael, and said unto him,

[Tobit 9:2]
"Azariah, my brother, take a servant with thee and two camels, and go forth"
