ΚΕΦ. ΚΖ΄. ΚΗ΄.
29 Παγίδι ἁλώσονται οἱ εὐφραινόμενοι πτώσει εὐσεβῶν, καὶ ὀδύνη
30 καταναλώσει αὐτοὺς πρὸ τοῦ θανάτου αὐτῶν. Μῆνις καὶ ὀργὴ
καὶ ταῦτα ἐστὶ βδελύγματα· καὶ ἀνὴρ ἁμαρτωλὸς ἐγκρατὴς ἔσται
αὐτῶν.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΗ΄. XXVIII.

1 Ὁ ἐκδικῶν παρὰ Κυρίου εὑρήσει ἐκδίκησιν, καὶ τὰς ἁμαρτίας
2 αὐτοῦ διατηρῶν διατηρήσει. Ἄφες ἀδίκημα τῷ πλησίον σου, καὶ
3 τότε δεηθέντος σου αἱ ἁμαρτίαι σου λυθήσονται. Ἄνθρωπος ἀν-
4 θρώπῳ συντηρεῖ ὀργήν, καὶ παρὰ Κυρίου ζητεῖ ἴασιν; Ἐπ᾽ ἀνθρώ-
5 που ὅμοιον αὐτῷ οὐκ ἔχει ἔλεος, καὶ περὶ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν αὐτοῦ
6 δεῖται; Αὐτὸς σὰρξ ὢν διατηρεῖ μῆνιν, τίς ἐξιλάσεται τὰς ἁμαρ-
7 τίας αὐτοῦ; Μνήσθητι τὰ ἔσχατα, καὶ παῦσαι ἐχθραίνων, κατα-
8 φθορὰν καὶ θάνατον, καὶ ἔμεινε ἐντολαῖς. Μνήσθητι ἐντολῶν,
9 καὶ μὴ μηνίσῃς τῷ πλησίον, καὶ διαθήκης ὑψίστου, καὶ πάριδε
10 ἄγνοιαν. Ἀπόσχου ἀπὸ μάχης, καὶ ἐλαττώσεις ἁμαρτίας· ἄνθρω-
11 πος γὰρ θυμώδης ἐκκαύσει μάχην, καὶ ἀνὴρ ἁμαρτωλὸς ταράξει
12 φίλους, καὶ ἀναμέσον εἰρηνευόντων ἐμβαλεῖ διχοβολήν. Κατὰ τὴν
13 ὕλην πυρὸς οὕτως ἐκκαυθήσεται, καὶ κατὰ τὴν στερέωσιν τῆς μά-
14 χης ἐκκαυθήσεται· κατὰ τὴν ἰσχὺν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ὁ θυμὸς αὐτοῦ
15 ἔσται, καὶ κατὰ τὸν πλοῦτον ἀνυψώσει ὀργὴν αὐτοῦ. Ἔρις κατα-
16 σπευδομένη ἐκκαίει πῦρ, καὶ μάχη κατασπεύδουσα ἐκχέει αἷμα.
17 Ἐὰν φυσήσῃς εἰς σπινθῆρα, ἐκκαήσεται, καὶ ἐὰν πτύσῃς εἰς αὐ-
18 τόν, σβεσθήσεται· καὶ ἀμφότερα ἐκ τοῦ στόματός σου ἐκπορεύε-
19 ται. Ψίθυρον καὶ δίγλωσσον καταράσασθε· πολλοὺς γὰρ εἰρηνευόν-
20 τας ἀπώλεσεν. Γλῶσσα τρίτη πολλοὺς ἐσάλευσε, καὶ διέστησεν
21 αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ ἔθνους εἰς ἔθνος, καὶ πόλεις ὀχυρὰς καθεῖλε, καὶ
22 οἰκίας μεγιστάνων κατέστρεψε· γλῶσσα τρίτη γυναῖκας ἀνδρείας
23 ἐξέβαλε, καὶ ἐστέρησεν αὐτὰς τῶν πόνων αὐτῶν· ὁ προσέχων αὐ-
24 τῇ οὐ μὴ εὕρῃ ἀνάπαυσιν, οὐδὲ κατασκηνώσει μεθ᾽ ἡσυχίας. Πλη-
25 γὴ μάστιγος ποιεῖ μώλωπα· πληγὴ δὲ γλώσσης συγκλάσει ὀστᾶ.
26 Πολλοὶ ἔπεσαν ἐν στόματι μαχαίρας, καὶ οὐχ ὡς οἱ πεπτωκότες
27 διὰ γλῶσσαν. Μακάριος ὁ σκεπασθεὶς ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτῆς, ὃς οὐ
28 διῆλθεν ἐν τῷ θυμῷ αὐτῆς, ὃς οὐκ εἵλκυσε τὸν ζυγὸν αὐτῆς, καὶ
29 τοῖς δεσμοῖς αὐτῆς οὐκ ἐδέθη· ὁ γὰρ ζυγὸς αὐτῆς ζυγὸς σιδηροῦς,

**Chapter Twenty-Seven**

29 By a snare shall they be caught, who rejoice in the fall of the righteous,
    and anguish shall consume them before their death.
30 Wrath and anger—yea, these are abominations;
    and a sinful man shall be held captive by them.

**Chapter Twenty-Eight**

1 He that seeketh vengeance from the Lord shall find vengeance,
    and [by so doing] his own sins he shall preserve [against himself].
2 Forgive thy neighbor his trespass,
3 and then, when thou makest supplication, thy sins shall be remitted unto thee.
4 Shall a man harbor wrath against another man,
    and yet seek healing from the Lord?
5 Upon a man who is like unto himself he hath no mercy,
    and yet for his own sins doth he make petition?
6 He himself, being but flesh, doth harbor wrath;
    who then shall make expiation for his sins?
7 Remember the last things, and cease to be hostile,
    [considering] corruption and death, and abide by the commandments.
8 Remember the commandments,
9 and be not wroth with thy neighbor;
    and [remember] the covenant of the Most High,
    and overlook [his] ignorance.
10 Abstain from contention, and thou shalt diminish sins;
11 for a man full of wrath shall kindle strife,
    and a sinful man shall trouble his friends,
12 and amongst them that are at peace shall he cast dissension.
13 According to the fuel of fire, so shall it be kindled,
    and according to the strengthening of the strife, so shall it burn forth.
14 According to the strength of a man shall his wrath be,
    and according to his wealth shall he elevate his anger.
15 Contention swiftly kindled doth ignite a fire,
    and battle swiftly hastened doth shed blood.
16 If thou dost blow upon a spark, it shall be kindled,
17 and if thou dost spit upon it, it shall be quenched;
18 and both [these things] do proceed from thy mouth.
19 Curse ye the whisperer and the double-tongued;
20 for many who were at peace hath it destroyed.
    The third tongue hath shaken many, and hath set them apart
21 from nation unto nation, and fortified cities hath it overthrown,
22 and the houses of great men hath it destroyed;
    the third tongue hath cast out courageous women,
23 and hath deprived them of their labors;
    he that giveth heed unto it
24 shall not find rest, neither shall he sojourn with quietness.
25 The stroke of a whip maketh a bruise;
    but the stroke of a tongue shall break bones.
26 Many have fallen by the mouth of the sword,
    yet not as those who have fallen
27 by the tongue.
    Blessed is he that is sheltered from its face, who hath not
28 passed through its wrath, who hath not drawn its yoke,
29 and to its bonds hath not been bound;
    for its yoke is a yoke of iron,
