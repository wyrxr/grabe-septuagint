1 Τῷ δὲ ἐνάτῳ καὶ τεσσαρακοστῷ καὶ ἑκατοστῷ ἔτει προσέ-
2 πεσε τοῖς περὶ τὸν Ἰούδαν, Ἀντίοχον τὸν Εὐπάτορα παραγενέ-
  σθαι σὺν πλήθεσιν ἐπὶ τὴν Ἰουδαίαν, καὶ σὺν αὐτῷ Λυσίαν τὸν
  ἐπίτροπον καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν πραγμάτων, ἕκαστον ἔχοντα δύναμιν Ἑλ-
  ληνικὴν πεζῶν μυριάδας ἕνδεκα, καὶ ἱππεῖς πεντακισχιλίους τρια-
  κοσίους, καὶ ἐλέφαντας εἰκοσίδυο, ἅρματα δὲ δρεπανηφόρα τρια-
3 κόσια. Συνέμιξε δὲ αὐτοῖς καὶ Μενέλαος, καὶ παρεκάλει μετὰ
  πολλῆς εἰρωνείας τὸν Ἀντίοχον, οὐκ ἐπὶ σωτηρίᾳ τῆς πατρίδος,
4 οἰόμενος δὲ ἐπὶ τῆς ἀρχῆς κατασταθήσεσθαι. Ὁ δὲ βασιλεὺς
  τῶν βασιλέων ἐξήγειρε τὸν θυμὸν τοῦ Ἀντιόχου ἐπὶ τὸν ἀλι-
  τήριον, καὶ Λυσίου ὑποδείξαντος τοῦτον αἴτιον εἶναι πάντων τῶν
  κακῶν προσέταξεν, ὡς ἔθος ἐστὶν ἐν τῷ τόπῳ, προσαπολέσαι,
5 ἀγαγόντας αὐτὸν εἰς Βέροιαν. Ἔστι δὲ ἐν τῷ τόπῳ πύργος
  πεντήκοντα πηχέων πλήρης σποδοῦ, ὄργανον δὲ εἶχε περιφερὲς
6 πάντοθεν ἀπόκρημνον εἰς τὴν σποδόν. Ἐνταῦθα τὸν ἱεροσυλίας
  ἔνοχον ὄντα, ἢ καὶ τινων ἄλλων κακῶν ὑπεροχὴν πεποιημένον,
7 ἅπαντες προσωθοῦσιν εἰς ὄλεθρον. Τοιούτῳ μόρῳ τὸν παρά-
8 νομον συνέβη θανεῖν, μηδὲ τῆς γῆς τυχόντα Μενέλαον. Πάνυ
  δικαίως· ἐπεὶ γὰρ συνετελέσατο πολλὰ περὶ τὸν βωμὸν ἁμαρ-
9 τήματα, οὗ τὸ πῦρ ἁγνὸν ἦν καὶ ἡ σποδός, ἐν σποδῷ τὸν θά-
  νατον ἐκομίσατο. Τοῖς δὲ φρονήμασιν ὁ βασιλεὺς βεβαρβαρω-
10 μένος ἤρχετο, τὰ χείριστα τῶν ἐπὶ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ γεγονό-
  των ἐνδεξόμενος τοῖς Ἰουδαίοις. Μεταλαβὼν δὲ Ἰούδας ταῦ-
11 τα, παρήγγειλε τῷ πλήθει δι᾿ ἡμέρας καὶ νυκτὸς ἐπικαλεῖσθαι
  τὸν Κύριον, εἴποτε ἄλλοτε, καὶ νῦν ἐπιβοηθεῖν τοῖς τοῦ νόμου
  καὶ πατρίδος καὶ ἱεροῦ ἁγίου στερεῖσθαι μέλλουσι, καὶ τὸν ἄρτι
  βραχέως ἀνεψύχοντα λαὸν μὴ ἐᾶσαι τοῖς δυσφήμοις ἔθνεσιν ὑπο-
12 χειρίους γενέσθαι. Πάντων δὲ τὸ αὐτὸ ποιησάντων ὁμοῦ καὶ
  καταξιωσάντων τὸν ἐλεήμονα Κύριον μετὰ κλαυθμοῦ καὶ νη-
  στειῶν καὶ προπτώσεως ἐφ᾽ ἡμέρας τρεῖς ἀδιαλείπτως, παρακα-
13 λέσας αὐτοὺς ὁ Ἰούδας ἐκέλευσε παραγίνεσθαι. Καθ᾽ ἑαυτὸν δὲ
  σὺν τοῖς πρεσβυτέροις γενόμενος, ἐβουλεύσατο πρὶν εἰσβαλεῖν τοῦ
  βασιλέως τὸ στράτευμα εἰς Ἰουδαίαν, καὶ γενέσθαι τῆς πόλεως

**Chapter 13**

**1** Now in the one hundred and forty-ninth year,
**2** it came to the knowledge of those about Judas that Antiochus Eupator was come with great multitudes against Judea; and with him Lysias, his guardian and chief minister of affairs, each having a Grecian force of one hundred and ten thousand footmen, and five thousand and three hundred horsemen, and two and twenty elephants, and three hundred scythed chariots.
**3** And Menelaus also joined himself unto them, and with much deceit did he entreat Antiochus, not for the salvation of his country,
**4** but supposing indeed that he should be established in authority. But the King of kings stirred up the wrath of Antiochus against that wicked man; and Lysias having shown that he was the cause of all these evils, the king commanded that he should be put to death, according to the custom of that place,
**5** when they had brought him unto Beroea. Now there was in that place a tower of fifty cubits, full of ashes, and it had a circular engine,
**6** precipitous on every side, leading down into the ashes. Therein, him that was found guilty of sacrilege, or had committed any other heinous wickedness,
**7** all did thrust down unto destruction.
**8** By such a fate did the lawless Menelaus perish, and not even obtaining burial in the earth. Most justly so; for as he had committed many sins against the altar,
**9** whose fire was pure and whose ashes were holy, even in ashes did he receive his death. But the king, being made barbarous in his mind,
**10** came forth, intending to inflict upon the Jews the worst of those things which had befallen them in his father’s time. And Judas, having learned these tidings,
**11** charged the multitude to call upon the Lord day and night, if ever at any other time, then now especially, that He would aid those who were about to be deprived of the Law, and of their country, and of the holy Temple; and not to suffer the people, who had but a little while found respite, to fall into the hands of the blasphemous nations.
**12** And when all had done the same, and had earnestly implored the merciful Lord with weeping, and with fastings, and with prostration, without ceasing for three days, Judas exhorted them,
**13** and commanded them to be ready. And being alone with the elders, he took counsel, before the king’s army should invade Judea and gain possession of the city,
