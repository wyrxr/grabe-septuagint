πᾶν διανόημα, οὐκ ἐκρύβη ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ εἰς λόγος. Τὰ μεγαλεῖα  21
τῆς σοφίας αὐτοῦ ἐκόσμησεν· ὃς ἐστὶ πρὸ τοῦ αἰῶνος καὶ εἰς τὸν
αἰῶνα, οὔτε προσετέθη οὔτε ἠλαττώθη, καὶ οὐ προσεδεήθη οὐδενὸς
συμβούλου. Ὡς πάντα τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ ἐπιθυμητά, καὶ ὡς σπινθῆρός  22
ἐστι θεωρῆσαι. Πάντα ταῦτα ζῇ καὶ μένει εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα 23
ἐν πάσαις χρείαις, καὶ πάντα ὑπακούει. Πάντα δισσά, ἓν κατέναντι  24
τοῦ ἑνός· καὶ οὐκ ἐποίησεν οὐδὲν ἐλλεῖπον. Ἐν τοῦ ἑνὸς 25
ἐστερέωσε τὰ ἀγαθά· καὶ τίς πλησθήσεται ὁρῶν δόξαν αὐτοῦ;

ΚΕΦ. ΜΓ΄. XLIII.

Γαύριαμα ὕψους στερέωμα καθαριότητος, εἶδος οὐρανοῦ 1
ἐν ὁράματι δόξης. Ἥλιος ἐν ὀπτασίᾳ διαγγέλλων ἐν ἐξόδῳ, σκεῦος 2
θαυμαστόν, ἔργον ὑψίστου· ἐν μεσημβρίᾳ αὐτοῦ ἀναξηραίνει χώραν, 3
καὶ ἐναντίον καύματος αὐτοῦ τίς ὑποστήσεται; Κάμινον φυσῶν 4
ἐν ἔργοις καύματος, τριπλάσιον ἥλιος ἐκκαίων ὄρη· ἀτμίδας
πυρώδεις ἐκρυσῶν, καὶ ἐκλάμπων ἀκτῖνας ἀμαυροῖ ὀφθαλμούς.
Μέγας ὁ Κύριος ὁ ποιήσας αὐτόν, καὶ ἐν λόγοις αὐτοῦ κατέσπευσε  5
πορείαν. Καὶ ἡ σελήνη ἐν στάσει εἰς καιρὸν αὐτῆς, ἀνάδειξις 6
χρόνων καὶ σημεῖον αἰῶνος· ἀπὸ σελήνης σημεῖον ἑορτῆς· 7
φωστήρ μειούμενος ἐπὶ συντελείᾳ. Μὴν κατὰ τὸ ὄνομα αὐτῆς 8
ἐστιν, αὐξανομένη θαυμαστῶς ἐν ἀλλοιώσει. Σκεῦος παρεμβολῶν 9
ἐν ὕψει, ἐν στερεώματι οὐρανοῦ ἐκλάμπων, κάλλος οὐρανοῦ, δόξα
ἄστρων, κόσμος φωτίζων ἐν ὑψίστοις Κυρίου· ἐν λόγοις Ἁγίου 10
στήσονται κατὰ κρίμα, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἐκλυθῶσιν ἐν φυλακαῖς αὐτῶν.
Ἴδε τόξον, καὶ εὐλόγησον τὸν ποιήσαντα αὐτό, σφόδρα ὡραῖον ἐν 11
τῷ αὐγάσματι αὐτοῦ· ἐγύρωσεν οὐρανὸν ἐν κυκλώσει δόξης, χεῖρες  12
ὑψίστου ἐτάνυσαν αὐτό. Προστάγματι αὐτοῦ κατέσπευσε χιόνα,  13
καὶ ταχύνει ἀστραπὰς κρίματος αὐτοῦ. Διὰ τοῦτο ἠνεώχθησαν  14
θησαυροί, καὶ ἐξέπτησαν νεφέλαι ὡς πετεινά· ἐν μεγαλείῳ 15
αὐτοῦ ἴσχυσε νεφέλας, καὶ διεθρύβησαν λίθοι χαλάζης. Καὶ ἐν 16
ὀπτασίᾳ αὐτοῦ σαλευθήσονται ὄρη· καὶ ἐν θελήματι αὐτοῦ πνεύσεται
νότος. Φωνὴ βροντῆς αὐτοῦ ὠδίνησε γῆν, καὶ καταιγὶς 17
βορέου καὶ συστροφὴ πνεύματος. Ὡς πετεινὰ καθιπτάμενα πάσσει
χιόνα, καὶ ὡς ἀκρὶς καταλύουσα ἡ κατάβασις αὐτῆς· κάλλος 18
λευκότητος αὐτῆς ἐκθαυμάσει, ὀφθαλμὸς καὶ ἐπὶ τοῦ ὑετοῦ αὐ-

**Chapter Forty-Two**

21 No thought passed Him by, neither was hidden from Him,
[even to the measure of] a word.
The great works of His wisdom He hath adorned;
For He is before the age and unto the age,
Neither hath aught been added nor diminished,
And He hath no need of any counselor.

22 How desirable are all His works;
And as a spark it is to behold [them].
23 All these things do live and abide for evermore in all their uses;
And all things obey [Him].
24 All things are twofold, one [set] over against the other;
And He hath made nothing to be wanting.
25 In the One He hath established the good things;
And who shall be satisfied, beholding His glory?

**Chapter Forty-Three**

1 The Exultation of the Height, the firmament of purity;
The very form of heaven in a vision of glory.
2 The Sun, in his appearing, doth proclaim [Him] in his going forth;
A wondrous vessel, the work of the Most High.
3 In his noonday, he parcheth the land;
And against his scorching heat, who shall stand?
4 [He is like] a furnace breathing forth in works of heat;
The sun, thrice [hotter], doth burn up mountains.
Fiery mists it doth pour forth,
And by shining forth its rays, it doth dim the eyes.
5 Great is the Lord that made him;
And by His word He hath hastened his course.
6 And the Moon, in her fixed place, [serveth] for her [appointed] season;
A showing forth of times and a sign of eternity.
7 From the moon cometh the sign of the feast;
A luminary waning unto [its] completion.
8 The month is according to her name,
Wondrously increasing in her alteration.
9 A vessel of encampments on high,
Shining forth in the firmament of heaven;
The beauty of heaven, the glory of the stars,
An illuminating ornament in the high [places] of the Lord.
10 By the words of the Holy One, they shall stand according to [His] decree;
And they shall not be loosed from their watches.
11 Behold the rainbow, and bless Him that made it;
Exceeding fair in its effulgence.
12 It hath encompassed the heaven in a circle of glory;
The hands of the Most High have stretched it forth.
13 By His command He maketh haste the snow;
And He doth speed the lightnings of His judgment.
14 For this cause have the treasures been opened;
And the clouds have flown forth as birds.
15 In His majesty, He hath strengthened the clouds;
And the stones of hail were crushed.
16 And at His appearing, the mountains shall be made to tremble;
And by His will, the south wind shall blow forth.
17 The voice of His thunder hath made the earth to travail;
And a tempest of the north wind, and a gathering of wind.
18 As birds flying low, it scattereth the snow;
And as devouring locusts is its descent.
The beauty of its whiteness shall astonish the eye,
And even at its rain...
