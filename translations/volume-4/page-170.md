17 αὐτοῖς ἐπὶ κώμην Δεσσαοῦ. Σίμων δὲ ἀδελφὸς Ἰούδα συμβεβληκὼς
τῷ Νικάνορι, βραχέως δὲ διὰ τὴν αἰφνίδιον τῶν ἀντιπάλων
ἀφασίαν ἐπταικώς.
18 Ὁμῶς δὲ ἀκούσας ὁ Νικάνωρ ἣν εἶχον οἱ περὶ τὸν Ἰούδαν ἀνδραγαθίαν,
καὶ ἐν τοῖς ὑπὲρ τῆς πατρίδος ἀγῶσιν εὐψυχίαν, ἐπευλαβεῖτο τὴν
κρίσιν δι᾽ αἱμάτων ποιήσασθαι.
19 Διόπερ ἔπεμψε Ποσειδώνιον καὶ Θεόδοτον καὶ Ματταθίαν, δοῦναι
καὶ λαβεῖν δεξιάς.
20 Πλείονος δὲ γενομένης περὶ τούτων ἐπισκέψεως, καὶ τοῦ ἡγεμόνος
τοῖς πλήθεσιν ἀνακοινωσαμένου, καὶ φανείσης ὁμοψύχου γνώμης,
ἐπένευσαν ταῖς συνθήκαις.
21 Ἐτάξαντο δὲ ἡμέραν ἐν ᾗ κατ᾽ ἰδίαν ἥξουσιν εἰς τὸ αὐτό· καὶ προῆλθε,
καὶ παρ᾽ ἑκάστου διαφόρους ἔθεσαν εἴσφορας.
22 Διέταξεν Ἰούδας ἐνόπλους ἑτοίμους ἐν τοῖς ἐπικαίροις τόποις, μὴ
ποτε ἐκ τῶν πολεμίων αἰφνιδίως κακουργία γένηται, τὴν ἁρμόζουσαν
ἐποιήσαντο κοινολογίαν.
23 Διέτριβε δὲ ὁ Νικάνωρ ἐν Ἱεροσολύμοις, καὶ ἔπραττεν οὐδὲν ἄτοπον·
τοὺς δὲ συναχθέντας ἀγελαίους ὄχλους ἀπέλυσε.
24 Καὶ εἶχε τὸν Ἰούδαν διαπαντὸς ἐν προσώπῳ, ψυχικῶς τῷ ἀνδρὶ
προσεκέκλητο.
25 Παρεκάλεσεν αὐτὸν γῆμαι καὶ παιδοποιῆσασθαι· ἐγάμησεν, εὐστάθησεν,
ἐκοινώνησε βίου.
26 Ὁ δὲ Ἄλκιμος συνιδὼν τὴν πρὸς ἀλλήλους εὔνοιαν καὶ τὰς γενομένας
συνθήκας, ἀναλαβὼν ἦκε πρὸς τὸν Δημήτριον, καὶ ἔλεγε τὸν Νικάνορα
ἀλλότρια φρονεῖν τῶν πραγμάτων· τὸν γὰρ ἐπίβουλον τῆς βασιλείας
αὐτοῦ Ἰούδαν διάζοχον ἀναδεδειχέναι.
27 Ὁ δὲ βασιλεὺς ἔκθυμος γενόμενος, καὶ ταῖς τοῦ παμπονήρου διαβολαῖς
ἐρεθισθείς, ἔγραψε Νικάνορι, ὑπὲρ μὲν τῶν συνθηκῶν, φάσκων
βαρέως φέρειν, κελεύων δὲ τὸν Μακκαβαῖον δέσμιον ἐξαποστέλλειν
εἰς Ἀντιόχειαν ταχέως.
28 Προπεπόντων δὲ τούτων τῷ Νικάνόρι, συνεκύπτετο, καὶ δυσφόρως
ἔφερεν, εἰ τὰ διεσταλμένα ἀθετήσει μηδὲν τ᾽ ἀνδρὸς ἀδικηκότος.
29 Ἐπεὶ δὲ τῷ βασιλεῖ ἀντιπράττειν οὐκ ἦν, εὔκαιρον ἐτήρει
στρατηγήματι τοῦτ᾽ ἐπιτελέσαι.
30 Ὁ δὲ Μακκαβαῖος αὐστηρότερον διεξαγάγοντα συνιδὼν τὸν Νικάνορα
τὰ πρὸς αὐτόν, καὶ τὴν ἡδισμένην ἀπάντησιν ἀγροικότερον ἐσχηκότα,
νοήσας οὐκ ἀπὸ τοῦ βελτίστου τὴν αὐστηρίαν εἶναι, συστρέψας οὐκ
ὀλίγους τῶν περὶ αὐτόν, συνεκρύπτετο τὸν Νικάνορα.
31 Συγγνοὺς δὲ ὁ ἕτερος, ἔτι γενναίως ὑπὸ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς ἐστρατήγηται,
παραγενόμενος ἐπὶ τὸ μέγιστον καὶ ἅγιον ἱερόν, τῶν ἱερέων τὰς
καθηκούσας θυσίας προσαγόντων, ἐκέλευσε παρα-

**Chapter 14**

**17** unto them at the village of Dessau. And Simon, the brother of Judas, having joined battle with Nicanor, yet did he briefly stumble by reason of the sudden inactivity of his adversaries.
**18** Nevertheless, when Nicanor heard of the valiant deeds which they about Judas possessed, and their stoutness of heart in the battles for their fatherland, he did grow exceedingly cautious to settle the contention by the shedding of blood.
**19** Therefore did he send Poseidonius, and Theodotus, and Mattathias, to make and receive terms of peace.
**20** And when much conference had passed concerning these things, and the captain had made it known unto the multitude, and a unanimous purpose had been brought forth, they yielded unto the covenants.
**21** And they set a day wherein they should come together privately; and [Nicanor] came forth, and diverse offerings did they set down, each from his own [party].
**22** Howbeit, Judas did array armed men in readiness at the opportune places, lest at any time a sudden villainy should come forth from the enemies; and they held meet communication.
**23** And Nicanor abode in Jerusalem, and committed nothing amiss; but the multitudinous throngs that had gathered, he did dismiss.
**24** And he had Judas ever in his sight, for he was bound in soul unto the man.
**25** He exhorted him to take a wife and to beget children: so he took a wife, and did settle, and was made partner of [Nicanor's] life.
**26** But Alcimus, when he saw the amity between them, and the covenants that had been established, did take himself and came unto Demetrius, and declared that Nicanor was of an alien mind concerning the affairs [of the realm]; for he had appointed Judas, the plotter against his kingdom, as a *diazoch*.
**27** Then the king, having become exceedingly wroth, and being inflamed by the slanders of that most wicked [Alcimus], did write unto Nicanor; stating, concerning the covenants, that he took them heavily, and commanding that Maccabaeus be quickly sent forth as a captive unto Antioch.
**28** But when these matters had been fore-impressed upon Nicanor, he was bowed low, and did bear it grievously, if he should violate the things enjoined, and the man having committed no offense.
**29** But since it was not for him to gainsay the king, he did await an opportune moment to perform this by a stratagem.
**30** Now Maccabaeus, when he perceived Nicanor to deal more harshly with him, and that his most pleasant greeting was now met with greater rudeness, understanding that this sternness was not from good intent, did gather no small number of those about him, and did hide Nicanor.
**31** But the other, when he perceived that he was yet valiantly outwitted by the man, came unto the great and holy Temple; and whilst the priests were offering the accustomed sacrifices, he commanded to deliver—
