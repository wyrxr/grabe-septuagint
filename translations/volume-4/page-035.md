ΚΕΦ. Ηʹ. ΙΟΥΔΙΘ
21 καθήσεται πᾶσα ἡ Ἰουδαία, καὶ προνομευθήσεται τὰ ἅγια ἡμῶν,
22 καὶ ἐζητήσει τὴν βεβήλωσιν αὐτῶν ἐκ τοῦ στόματος ἡμῶν, καὶ
τὸν φόνον τῶν ἀδελφῶν ἡμῶν, καὶ τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν τῆς γῆς, καὶ
τὴν ἐρήμωσιν τῆς κληρονομίας ἡμῶν ἐπιστρέψει εἰς κεφαλὴν ἡμῶν
ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν, οὗ ἐὰν δουλεύσωμεν ἐκεῖ, καὶ ἐσόμεθα εἰς πρό-
σκομμα καὶ εἰς ὄνειδος ἐναντίον τῶν κτωμένων ἡμᾶς.
23 Ὅτι οὐ κατευθυνθήσεται ἡ δουλεία ἡμῶν εἰς χάριν, ἀλλ᾽ εἰς ἀτιμίαν θήσει
24 αὐτὴν Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν. Καὶ νῦν, ἀδελφοί, ἐπιδειξώμεθα τοῖς
ἀδελφοῖς ἡμῶν, ὅτι ἐξ ἡμῶν κρέμαται ἡ ψυχὴ αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰ ἅγια
25 καὶ ὁ οἶκος καὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον ἐπεστήρικται ἐφ᾽ ἡμῖν. Παρὰ ταῦτα
πάντα εὐχαριστήσωμεν Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ ἡμῶν, ὃς πειράζει ἡμᾶς
26 καθὰ καὶ τοὺς πατέρας ἡμῶν. Μνήσθητε ὅσα ἐποίησε μετὰ Ἀβραὰμ,
καὶ ὅσα ἐπείρασε τὸν Ἰσαὰκ, καὶ ὅσα ἐγένετο τῷ Ἰακὼβ
ἐν Μεσοποταμίᾳ τῆς Συρίας, ποιμαίνοντος αὐτοῦ τὰ πρόβατα
27 Λάβαν τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ τῆς μητρὸς αὐτοῦ· ὅτι εὐ καθὼς ἐκείνους
ἐπύρωσεν εἰς ἐτασμὸν τῆς καρδίας αὐτῶν, καὶ ἡμᾶς οὐκ ἐξεδίκησεν,
ἀλλ᾽ εἰς νουθέτησιν μαστιγεῖ Κύριος τοὺς ἐγγίζοντας αὐτῷ.
28 Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτὴν Ὀζίας· πάντα ὅσα εἶπας, ἐν ἀγαθῇ καρδίᾳ
29 ἐλάλησας, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ὃς ἀντιστήσεται τοῖς λόγοις σου. Ὅτι
οὐκ ἐν τῇ σήμερον ἡ σοφία σου πρόδηλός ἐστιν, ἀλλὰ ἀπ᾽ ἀρχῆς
ἡμερῶν σου ἔγνω πᾶς ὁ λαὸς τὴν σύνεσίν σου, καθότι ἀγαθόν ἐστι
30 τὸ πλάσμα τῆς καρδίας σου. Ἀλλὰ ὁ λαὸς δεδίκηκε σφόδρα, καὶ
ἠνάγκασεν ἡμᾶς ποιῆσαι καθὰ ἐλαλήσαμεν αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἐπήγαγεν
31 ἐφ᾽ ἡμᾶς ὅρκον, ὃν οὐ παραβησόμεθα. Καὶ νῦν δεήθητι περὶ ἡμῶν,
ἔτι γυνὴ εὐσεβὴς εἶ, καὶ ἀποστελεῖ Κύριος τὸν ὑετὸν εἰς
32 πλήρωσιν τῶν λάκκων ἡμῶν, καὶ οὐκ ἐκλείψομεν ἔτι. Καὶ εἶπε
πρὸς αὐτοὺς Ἰουδίθ· ἀκούσατέ μου, καὶ ποιήσω πρᾶγμα ὃ ἀφίξεται
εἰς γενεὰς γενεῶν υἱοῖς τοῦ γένους ἡμῶν.
33 Ὑμεῖς στήσεσθε ἐπὶ τῆς πύλης τὴν νύκτα ταύτην, καὶ ἐξελεύσομαι
ἐγὼ μετὰ τῆς ἄβρας μου, καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις μεθ᾽ ἃς εἴπατε
παραδώσειν τὴν πόλιν τοῖς ἐχθροῖς ἡμῶν, ἐπισκέψεται Κύριος τὸν
Ἰσραὴλ ἐν
34 χειρί μου. Ὑμεῖς δὲ οὐκ ἐξερευνήσετε τὴν πρᾶξιν μου. οὐ γὰρ
35 ἀναγγελῶ ὑμῖν, ἕως τοῦ τελεσθῆναι ἃ ἐγὼ ποιῶ. Καὶ εἶπεν Ὀζίας
καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες πρὸς αὐτήν· πορεύου εἰς εἰρήνην, καὶ Κύριος ὁ
36 Θεὸς ἔμπροσθέν σου εἰς ἐκδίκησιν τῶν ἐχθρῶν ἡμῶν. Καὶ ἀποστρέψαντες
ἐκ τῆς σκηνῆς, ἐπορεύθησαν ἐπὶ τὰς διατάξεις αὐτῶν.

#### CHAPTER 8

21 All Judea shall be laid low, and our holy things shall be plundered;
22 and He shall require the defilement thereof from our mouth, and the slaughter of our brethren, and the captivity of the land, and the desolation of our inheritance shall He turn upon our head among the nations, where we shall serve; and we shall be made a stumbling-block and a reproach before them that possess us.
23 For our servitude shall not prosper unto grace, but the Lord our God shall set it unto dishonor.
24 And now, brethren, let us make manifest unto our brethren that their very lives hang upon us, and that the holy things, and the House, and the Altar are sustained by us.
25 Notwithstanding all these things, let us give thanks unto the Lord our God, who trieth us even as He tried our fathers.
26 Remember whatsoever He did with Abraham, and whatsoever He tried Isaac with, and whatsoever befell Jacob in Mesopotamia of Syria, whilst he pastured the sheep of Laban, his mother's brother;
27 for indeed, just as He refined them for the examination of their heart, so hath He not taken vengeance upon us, but for admonition the Lord scourgeth them that draw near unto Him.
28 Then said Uzziah unto her, "All whatsoever thou hast spoken, thou hast spoken from a good heart, and there is none who shall gainsay thy words.
29 For not in this day alone is thy wisdom made manifest, but from the beginning of thy days hath all the people known thy understanding, inasmuch as the formation of thy heart is good.
30 But the people have been sorely tried, and have compelled us to do as we spoke unto them, and have brought upon us an oath, which we shall not transgress.
31 And now, pray concerning us, for thou art yet a pious woman, and the Lord shall send the rain for the filling of our cisterns, and we shall not fail any longer."
32 Then said Judith unto them, "Hearken unto me, and I will perform a deed which shall be recounted unto generations of generations for the sons of our lineage.
33 Ye shall stand at the gate this night, and I shall go forth with my maidservant; and in the days after which ye have said ye would deliver the city unto our enemies, the Lord shall visit Israel by my hand.
34 But ye shall not inquire into my deed; for I will not declare it unto you, until that which I do shall be accomplished."
35 And Uzziah and the rulers said unto her, "Go forth in peace, and may the Lord God be before thee for the avenging of our enemies."
36 And they turned away from the tent, and went forth unto their appointed stations.
