**16** φίλοις ὑμῶν. Καὶ ἐνεπίστευσαν αὐτῷ, καὶ συνέλαβεν ἐξ αὐτῶν ἑξήκοντα ἄνδρας, καὶ ἀπέκτεινεν αὐτοὺς ἐν ἡμέρᾳ μιᾷ κατὰ
**17** τοὺς λόγους οὓς ἔγραφε. Σάρκας ὁσίων σου καὶ αἵματα αὐτῶν
**18** ἐξέχεεν κύκλῳ Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ οὐκ ἦν αὐτοῖς ὁ θάπτων. Καὶ ἐπέπεσεν αὐτῶν ὁ φόβος καὶ ὁ τρόμος ἐπὶ πάντα τὸν λαόν, ὅτι εἶπαν· οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν αὐτοῖς ἀλήθεια καὶ κρίσις· παρέβησαν γὰρ
**19** τὴν στάσιν καὶ τὸν ὅρκον, ὃν ὤμοσαν. Καὶ ἀπῆρε Βαχχίδης ἀπὸ Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ παρενέβαλεν ἐν Βηζέθ, καὶ ἀπέστειλε καὶ συνέλαβε πολλοὺς ἀπὸ τῶν ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ αὐτομολησάντων ἀνδρῶν, καί τινας τοῦ λαοῦ, καὶ ἔθυσεν αὐτοὺς εἰς τὸ φρέαρ τὸ μέγα.
**20** Καὶ κατέστησε τὴν χώραν τῷ Ἀλκίμῳ, καὶ ἀφῆκε μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ δύναμιν τοῦ βοηθεῖν αὐτῷ· καὶ ἀπῆλθε Βαχχίδης πρὸς τὸν
**21** βασιλέα. Καὶ ἠγωνίσατο Ἄλκιμος περὶ τῆς ἀρχιερωσύνης.
**22** Καὶ συνήχθησαν πρὸς αὐτὸν πάντες οἱ ταράσσοντες τὸν λαὸν αὐτῶν, καὶ κατεκράτησαν γῆν Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐποίησαν πληγὴν μεγάλην ἐν Ἰσραήλ.
**23** Καὶ εἶδεν Ἰούδας πᾶσαν τὴν κακίαν, ἣν ἐποίησεν
**24** Ἄλκιμος καὶ οἱ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἐν υἱοῖς Ἰσραὴλ ὑπὲρ τὰ ἔθνη. Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν εἰς πάντα τὰ ὅρια τῆς Ἰουδαίας καὶ κυκλόθεν, καὶ ἐποίησεν ἐκδίκησιν ἐν τοῖς ἀνδράσι (καὶ) τοῖς αὐτομολήσασι, καὶ
**25** ἀνεστάλησαν τοῦ πορευθῆναι εἰς χώραν. Ὡς δὲ εἶδεν Ἄλκιμος, ὅτι ἐνίσχυεν Ἰούδας καὶ οἱ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔγνω ὅτι οὐ δύναται ὑποστῆναι αὐτούς, καὶ ἐπέστρεψε πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα καὶ κατηγόρησεν αὐτῶν πονηρά.
**26** Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Νικάνωρα ἕνα τῶν ἀρχόντων αὐτοῦ τῶν ἐνδόξων, καὶ μισοῦντα καὶ ἐχθραίνοντα τῷ Ἰσραήλ,
**27** καὶ ἐνετείλατο αὐτῷ ἐξᾶραι τὸν λαόν. Καὶ ἦλθε Νικάνωρ εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ δυνάμει πολλῇ, καὶ ἀπέστελε πρὸς Ἰούδαν καὶ τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ μετὰ δόλου λόγοις εἰρηνικοῖς,
**28** λέγων. Μὴ ἔστω μάχη ἀναμέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ ὑμῶν· ἥξω ἐν ἀνδράσιν ὀλίγοις,
**29** ἵνα ἴδω ὑμῶν τὰ πρόσωπα μετ᾿ εἰρήνης. Καὶ ἦλθε πρὸς Ἰούδαν, καὶ ἠσπάσαντο ἀλλήλους εἰρηνικῶς· καὶ οἱ
**30** πολέμιοι ἦσαν ἔτοιμοι ἐξαρπάσαι τὸν Ἰούδαν. Καὶ ἐγνώσθη ὁ λόγος τῷ Ἰούδᾳ, ὅτι μετὰ δόλου ἦλθεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτόν· καὶ ἐποτόθη
**31** ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἐβουλήθη ἔτι ἰδεῖν τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἔγνω Νικάνωρ, ὅτι ἀπεκαλύφθη ἡ βουλὴ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐξῆλθεν εἰς
**32** συνάντησιν τῷ Ἰούδᾳ ἐν πολέμῳ κατὰ Χαρφαρσαραμά. Καὶ ἔπεσαν τῶν παρὰ Νικάνορος ὡς πεντακισχίλιοι ἄνδρες, καὶ ἔφυγον

**16** nor unto your friends." And they trusted him; yet he seized from among them threescore men, and slew them in a single day, according to
**17** the words which he had written: "The flesh of Thy holy ones and their blood
**18** He poured out round about Jerusalem, and none there was to bury them." And fear and trembling fell upon all the people, for they said, "There is no truth nor justice in them; for they have transgressed
**19** the covenant and the oath which they had sworn." And Bacchides departed from Jerusalem and encamped in Beth-zaith; and he sent forth and seized many of the men who had deserted from his ranks, and certain of the people, and he slew them, casting them into the great pit.
**20** And he set Alcimus over the land, and left with him a force to aid him; then Bacchides departed unto the king.
**21** And Alcimus strove for the high priesthood.
**22** And all those who troubled their own people gathered themselves unto him; and they seized the land of Judah, and wrought a great plague in Israel.
**23** And Judas beheld all the wickedness which Alcimus and those with him had wrought among the sons of Israel, even more grievously than the nations.
**24** And he went forth into all the borders of Judea, and round about; and he executed vengeance upon the men, [even] upon those who had deserted; and
**25** they were restrained from going forth into the country. But when Alcimus perceived that Judas and his company grew strong, and knew that he could not withstand them, he returned unto the king and brought grievous accusations against them.
**26** And the king sent forth Nicanor, one of his glorious princes, who hated and bore enmity toward Israel;
**27** and he commanded him to destroy the people. And Nicanor came unto Jerusalem with a mighty force, and sent unto Judas and his brethren with guile, speaking words of peace, saying,
**28** "Let there be no battle between me and you; for I shall come with a few men,
**29** that I may see your faces in peace." So he came unto Judas, and they greeted one another peaceably; yet the enemies were ready
**30** to seize Judas. And the matter was made known unto Judas, that he was come against him with guile; and he was sickened thereby,
**31** and he would no longer see his face. Then Nicanor knew that his counsel was revealed, and he went forth to
**32** meet Judas in battle near Capharsalama. And there fell from Nicanor's company about five thousand men, and they fled.
