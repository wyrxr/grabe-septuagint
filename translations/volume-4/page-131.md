**20** μῖν δέξασθαι τὴν ἀσπίδα παρ᾿ αὐτῶν. Εἴ τινες οὖν λοιμοὶ διαπεφεύγασιν ἐκ τῆς χώρας αὐτῶν πρὸς ὑμᾶς, παραδοτε αὐτοὺς τῷ Σίμωνι τῷ ἀρχιερεῖ, ὅπως ἐκδικήσῃ αὐτοὺς κατὰ τὸν νόμον αὐτῶν.
**21** Καὶ τὰ αὐτὰ ἔγραφε Δημητρίῳ τῷ βασιλεῖ, καὶ ᾿Αττά-
**22** λῳ, καὶ ᾿Αριαράθῃ, καὶ ᾿Αρσάκῃ, καὶ εἰς πάσας τὰς χώρας, καὶ Σαμφάκῃ, καὶ Σπαρτιάταις, καὶ εἰς Δῆλον, καὶ εἰς Μῦνδον, καὶ εἰς Συκιῶνα, καὶ εἰς τὴν Καρίαν, καὶ εἰς Σάμον, καὶ εἰς τὴν Παμφυλίαν, καὶ εἰς τὴν Λυκίαν, καὶ εἰς ᾿Αλικαρνασσόν, καὶ εἰς Κῶ, καὶ εἰς Σίδην, καὶ εἰς ῎Αραδον, καὶ εἰς Ῥόδον, καὶ εἰς τὴν Φασηλίδα, καὶ εἰς Γόρτυναν, καὶ Κνίδον, καὶ Κύπρον, καὶ Κυρήνην.
**23** Τὸ δὲ ἀντίγραφον αὐτῶν ἔγραφε Σίμωνι τῷ ἀρχιερεῖ.
**24** ᾿Αντίοχος δὲ ὁ βασιλεὺς παρενέβαλεν ἐπὶ Δωρᾶ ἐν τῇ δευτέρᾳ, προσάγων διαπαντὸς αὐτῇ τὰς χεῖρας καὶ μηχανὰς ποιούμενος, καὶ συνέκλεισε τὸν Τρύφωνα τοῦ μὴ εἰσπορεύεσθαι καὶ ἐκπορεύεσθαι.
**25** Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν αὐτῷ Σίμων δισχιλίους ἄνδρας ἐκλεκτοὺς συμμαχῆσαι αὐτῷ καὶ ἀργύριον καὶ χρυσίον καὶ σκεύη ἱκανά.
**26** Καὶ οὐκ ἐβούλετο αὐτὰ δέξασθαι, ἀλλὰ ἠθέτησε πάντα ὅσα συνέθετο αὐτῷ τὸ πρότερον, καὶ ἠλλοτριοῦτο αὐτῷ.
**27** Καὶ ἀπέστειλε πρὸς αὐτὸν ᾿Αθηνόβιον ἕνα τῶν φίλων αὐτοῦ κοινολογησόμενον αὐτῷ, λέγων· ὑμεῖς κατακρατεῖτε τῆς ᾿Ιόππης καὶ Γαζάρων καὶ τῆς ἄκρας τῆς ἐν ῾Ιερουσαλὴμ πόλεις τῆς βασιλείας μου.
**28** Τὰ ὅρια αὐτῶν ἠρημώσατε, καὶ ἐποιήσατε πληγὴν μεγάλην ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἐκυριεύσατε τόπων πολλῶν ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ μου.
**29** Νῦν οὖν παράδοτε τὰς πόλεις, ἃς κατελάβεσθε, καὶ τοὺς φόρους τῶν τόπων, ὧν κατεκυριεύσατε, ἐκτὸς τῶν ὁρίων τῶν ἐκ τῆς ᾿Ιουδαίας.
**30** Εἰ δὲ μή, δότε ἀντ᾿ αὐτῶν πεντακόσια τάλαντα ἀργυρίου καὶ τῆς καταφθορᾶς, ἧς κατεφθάρκατε, καὶ τῶν φόρων τῶν πόλεων ἄλλα τάλαντα πεντακόσια· εἰ δὲ μή, παραγενόμενοι ἐκπολεμήσομεν ὑμᾶς.
**31** Καὶ ἦλθεν ᾿Αθηνόβιος φίλος τοῦ βασιλέως εἰς ῾Ιερουσαλήμ, καὶ εἶδε τὴν δόξαν Σίμωνος, καὶ κυλικεῖον μετὰ χρυσωμάτων καὶ ἀργυρωμάτων, καὶ παράστασιν ἱκανήν, καὶ ἐξίστατο, καὶ ἀπήγγειλεν αὐτῷ τοὺς λόγους τοῦ βασιλέως.
**32** Καὶ ἀποκριθεὶς Σίμων εἶπεν αὐτῷ· Οὔτε γῆν ἀλλοτρίαν εἰλήφαμεν, οὔτε ἀλλοτρίων κεκρατήκαμεν, ἀλλὰ τῆς κληρονομίας τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν, ὑπὸ δὲ ἐχθρῶν ἡμῶν ἀκρίτως ἐν τινι καιρῷ κατεκρατήθη.
**33** Ἡμεῖς δὲ καιρὸν ἔχοντες ἀντεχόμεθα

**Chapter 15**

**20** [It hath seemed good] unto us to receive the shield from them. If therefore any pestilent men have escaped from their country unto you, deliver them unto Simon the high priest, that he may take vengeance upon them according to their own law.

**21** And the same things did he write unto King Demetrius, and unto Attalus,

**22** and Ariarathes, and Arsaces, and unto all the lands, and unto Samphaces, and unto the Spartans, and unto Delos, and unto Myndus, and unto Sicyon, and unto Caria, and unto Samos, and unto Pamphylia, and unto Lycia, and unto Halicarnassus, and unto Cos, and unto Side, and unto Aradus, and unto Rhodes, and unto Phaselis, and unto Gortyna, and Cnidus, and Cyprus, and Cyrene.

**23** And the copy of these things did he write unto Simon the high priest.

**24** Now King Antiochus did encamp against Dora for the second time, continually bringing forth his assaults and making engines of war against it; and he did shut up Tryphon, that he might not enter in nor come forth.

**26** But he would not receive them, nay, he did set at nought all that he had agreed with him aforetime, and he became estranged from him.

**27** And he sent unto him Athenobius, one of his friends, to confer with him, saying, "Ye do hold by force Joppa and Gazara, and the citadel that is in Jerusalem, even cities of my kingdom.

**30** But if ye will not, then give for them five hundred talents of silver; and for the havoc which ye have wrought, and for the tributes of the cities, another five hundred talents. Else, if ye will not, we will come and wage war against you."

**31** And Athenobius, the king's friend, came unto Jerusalem, and he beheld the glory of Simon, and a service of plate adorned with golden and silver work, and a goodly retinue; and he was astonished, and did report unto him the words of the king.

**32** And Simon answered him and said, "Neither have we taken a foreign land, nor have we taken possession of that which belongeth unto others, but [it is] the inheritance of our fathers, which was unjustly seized by our enemies at a certain season.

**33** But we, having opportunity, do hold fast to..."
