βασιλεῖ, ὅτι παραγενόμενοι εἰς τὴν χώραν τῆς Ἰουδαίας, καὶ ἐλθόντες
εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ τὴν πόλιν, κατελάβομεν τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας τοὺς
πρεσβυτέρους τῶν Ἰουδαίων ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ τῇ πόλει οἰκοδομοῦν-
τας οἶκον τῷ Κυρίῳ μέγαν, καινὸν διὰ λίθων ξυστῶν καὶ πολυ-
τελῶν, ξύλων τιθεμένων ἐν τοῖς τοίχοις, καὶ τὰ ἔργα ἐκεῖνα ἐπὶ 9
σπουδῆς γινόμενα, καὶ εὐοδούμενον τὸ ἔργον ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν αὐ-
τῶν, καὶ ἐν πάσῃ δόξῃ καὶ ἐπιμελείᾳ συντελούμενον. Τότε ἐπυν-
θανόμεθα τῶν πρεσβυτέρων τούτων, λέγοντες· τίνος ὑμῖν προστά- 10
ξαντος, οἰκοδομεῖτε τὸν οἶκον τοῦτον, καὶ τὰ ἔργα ταῦτα θεμελιοῦ-
τε; Ἐπερωτήσαμεν οὖν αὐτούς, ἕνεκεν τοῦ γνωρίσαι σοι, καὶ γρά- 11
ψαι σοι τοὺς ἀνθρώπους τοὺς ἀφηγουμένους, καὶ τὴν ὀνοματογρα-
φίαν ἠτοῦμεν αὐτοὺς τῶν προκαθηγουμένων. Οἱ δὲ ἀπεκρίθησαν 12
ἡμῖν, λέγοντες· Ἡμεῖς ἐσμεν παῖδες τοῦ Κυρίου τοῦ κτίσαντος τὸν οὐ-
ρανὸν καὶ τὴν γῆν. Καὶ ᾠκοδόμητο οἶκος ἔμπροσθεν ἐτῶν πλειόνων 13
διὰ βασιλέως μεγάλου καὶ ἰσχυροῦ, καὶ ἐπετελέσθη. Καὶ ἐπεὶ οἱ πα- 14
τέρες ἡμῶν παραπικράναντες ἥμαρτον εἰς τὸν Κύριον τοῦ Ἰσρα-
ὴλ τὸν οὐράνιον, παρέδωκεν αὐτοὺς εἰς χεῖρας Ναβουχοδονόσορ
βασιλέως τῆς Βαβυλωνίας, βασιλέως τῶν Χαλδαίων. Τόν τε οἶ- 15
κον καθελόντες ἐνεπύρισαν, καὶ τὸν λαὸν ᾐχμαλώτευσαν εἰς Βα-
βυλῶνα. Ἐν δὲ τῷ πρώτῳ ἔτει βασιλεύοντος Κύρου χώρας Βαβυ- 16
λωνίας, ἔγραψεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Κῦρος τὸν οἶκον τοῦτον οἰκοδομηθῆναι,
καὶ τὰ ἱερὰ σκεύη τὰ χρυσᾶ καὶ τὰ ἀργυρᾶ, ἃ ἐξήνεγκε Ναβου- 17
χοδονόσορ ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ, καὶ ἀπερείσατο αὐτὰ ἐν
τῷ ἑαυτοῦ ναῷ, πάλιν ἐξήνεγκεν αὐτὰ Κῦρος ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐκ τοῦ
ναοῦ τοῦ ἐν Βαβυλῶνι καὶ παρεδόθη Ζοροβάβελ καὶ Σαναβασσά- 18
ρῳ τῷ ἐπάρχῳ· καὶ ἐπετάγη αὐτῷ ἀπενέγκαντι πάντα ταῦτα τὰ
σκεύη ἀποθεῖναι ἐν τῷ ναῷ τῷ ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ, καὶ τὸν ναὸν τοῦ
Κυρίου τοῦτον οἰκοδομηθῆναι ἐπὶ τοῦ τόπου. Τότε ὁ Σαναβάσ- 19
σαρος ἐκεῖνος παραγενόμενος ἐνεβάλετο τοὺς θεμελίους τοῦ οἴκου
τοῦ Κυρίου τοῦ ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ, καὶ ἀπ᾽ ἐκείνου μέχρι τοῦ νῦν
οἰκοδομούμενος οὐκ ἔλαβε συντέλειαν. Νῦν οὖν εἰ κρίνεται, βασι- 20
λεύ, ἐπισκεπτέσθω ἐν τοῖς βασιλικοῖς βιβλιοφυλακίοις τοῦ Κύρου·
καὶ ἐὰν εὑρίσκητε μετὰ τῆς γνώμης Κύρου τοῦ βασιλέως γενομέ- 21
νην τὴν οἰκοδομὴν τοῦ οἴκου Κυρίου τοῦ ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ, καὶ κρί-
νηται τῷ κυρίῳ βασιλεῖ ἡμῶν, προσημανάτω ἡμῖν περὶ τούτων.
Τότε ὁ βασιλεὺς Δαρεῖος προσέταξεν ἐπισκέψασθαι ἐν τοῖς βα- 22

**Chapter VI.**

**8** ...unto the king, that when we came into the land of Judea, and entered the city of Jerusalem, we found the elders of the Jews, [who had returned] from the captivity, building in the city of Jerusalem a great house unto the Lord, a new one, made with hewn and costly stones, and with timbers laid in the walls thereof.
**9** And those works were being done with great diligence, and the labor prospered in their hands, and was being completed with all glory and carefulness.
**10** Then enquired we of these elders, saying, "By whose command do you build this house, and lay the foundations of these works?"
**11** Therefore we asked them, so that we might make known unto you, and write unto you the names of the men who lead, and we requested of them the register of the names of those who were in charge.
**12** And they answered us, saying, "We are the servants of the Lord, who created the heaven and the earth.
**13** And a house had been built many years ago by a great and mighty king, and it was completed.
**14** And inasmuch as our fathers had bitterly provoked and sinned against the Lord of Israel, the Heavenly One, He delivered them into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylonia, the king of the Chaldeans.
**15** And they cast down the house and set it ablaze, and the people they carried captive unto Babylon.
**16** Now in the first year that Cyrus reigned over the land of Babylonia, King Cyrus wrote that this house should be built,
**17** and the sacred vessels, both of gold and of silver, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth from the house that was in Jerusalem, and had stored them in his own temple, King Cyrus again brought them forth from the temple that was in Babylon, and they were delivered unto Zerubbabel and unto Sanabassarus the satrap.
**18** And it was commanded him, that having carried all these vessels, he should lay them up in the temple which is in Jerusalem; and that this temple of the Lord should be built upon that place.
**19** Then that Sanabassarus, having come, laid the foundations of the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem, and from that time until now, though it be continually building, it hath not yet received its completion.
**20** Now therefore, O King, if it be deemed right, let search be made in the royal archives of Cyrus;
**21** and if you find that the building of the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem was done according to the decree of King Cyrus, and if it be judged right by our lord the king, let him send us word concerning these matters."
**22** Then King Darius commanded that search be made in the royal archives which were kept in Babylon,
