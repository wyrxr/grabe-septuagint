2 πλεύσαντα μετὰ πλήθους ἰσχυροῦ καὶ στόλου, κεκρατηκέναι τῆς
    χώρας, ἐπανελόμενον Ἀντίοχον καὶ τὸν τούτου ἐπίτροπον Λυ-
3 σίαν. Ἄλκιμος δέ τις προγενόμενος ἀρχιερεύς, ἑκουσίως δὲ με-
    μολυμμένος ἐν τοῖς τῆς ἐπιμιξίας χρόνοις, συννοήσας, ὅτι καθ’
    ὁντιναοῦν τρόπον οὐκ ἔστιν αὐτῷ σωτηρία, οὐδὲ πρὸς τὸ ἅγιον
4 θυσιαστήριον ἔτι πρόσοδοι, ἧκε πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Δημήτριον ὡς
    πρώτῳ καὶ ἑκατοστῷ καὶ πεντηκοστῷ ἔτει, προσάγων αὐτῷ στέ-
5 φανον χρυσοῦν καὶ φοίνικα, πρὸς δὲ τούτοις τῶν νομιζομένων
    θαλλῶν τοῦ ἱεροῦ· καὶ τὴν ἡμέραν ἐκείνην ἡσυχίαν ἔσχε. Και-
    ρὸν δὲ λαβὼν τῆς ἰδίας ἀνοίας συνεργὸν, προσκληθεὶς εἰς συνέ-
    δριον ὑπὸ τοῦ Δημητρίου, καὶ ἐπερωτηθεὶς, ἐν τίνι διαθέσει καὶ
6 βουλὴ καθεστήκασιν οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι, πρὸς ταῦτα ἔφη, Οἱ λεγόμενοι
    τῶν Ἰουδαίων Ἀσσαῖοι, ὧν ἀφηγεῖται Ἰούδας ὁ Μακκαβαῖος,
    πολεμοτροφοῦσι καὶ στασιάζουσιν, οὐκ ἔδοντες τὴν βασιλείαν εὐ-
7 σταθείας τυχεῖν. Ὅθεν ἀφελόμενος τὴν προγονικὴν δόξαν, λέ-
8 γω δὴ τὴν ἀρχιερωσύνην, δεῦρο νῦν ἐλήλυθα, πρῶτον μὲν ὑπὲρ
    τῶν ἀνηκόντων τῷ βασιλεῖ γνησίως φρονῶν, δεύτερον δὲ καὶ τῶν
    ἰδίων πολιτῶν στοχαζόμενος· τῇ μὲν γὰρ τῶν προειρημένων ἀ-
9 λογιστίᾳ τὸ σύμπαν ἡμῶν γένος οὐ μικρῶς ἀκληρεῖ. Ἕκαστα
    δὲ τούτων ἐπεγνωκὼς, σὺ βασιλεῦ, καὶ τῆς χώρας καὶ τοῦ πε-
    ριισταμένου γένους ἡμῶν προνοήθητι, καθ’ ἣν ἔχεις πρὸς ἅπαντας
10 εὐαπάντητον φιλανθρωπίαν. Ἄχρι γὰρ Ἰούδας περίεστιν, ἀδύνα-
11 τον εἰρήνης τυχεῖν τὰ πράγματα. Τοιούτων δὲ ῥηθέντων ὑπὸ
    τούτου, θᾶττον οἱ λοιποὶ φίλοι δυσμενῶς ἔχοντες τὰ πρὸς τὸν
12 Ἰούδαν προσεπύρωσαν τὸν Δημήτριον. Προσκαλεσάμενος δὲ εὐ-
    θέως τὸν Νικάνορα τὸν γενόμενον ἐλεφαντάρχην, καὶ στρατηγὸν
13 ἀναδείξας τῆς Ἰουδαίας, ἐξαπέστειλε· δοὺς ἐντολὰς, αὐτὸν μὲν
    τὸν Ἰούδαν ἐπανελέσθαι, τοὺς δὲ σὺν αὐτῷ σκορπίσαι, καταστῆ-
14 σαι δὲ Ἄλκιμον ἀρχιερέα τοῦ μεγίστου ἱεροῦ. Τὰ δὲ ἐκ τῆς
    Ἰουδαίας περιγαδευκότα τὸν Ἰούδαν ἔθνη συνέμισγον ἀγεληδὸν
    τῷ Νικάνορι, τὰς τῶν Ἰουδαίων ἀτυχίας καὶ συμφορὰς, ἰδίας εὐη-

**Chapter 14**

**2** having entered through the port of Tripoli with a mighty multitude and a fleet, had taken possession of the country, and had removed Antiochus and Lysias, his guardian.

**3** But a certain Alcimus, who had been high priest before, but had willingly defiled himself in the times of [Gentile] mingling, perceiving that in no wise was there salvation for him, nor yet any more access to the holy altar,

**4** came unto King Demetrius in the one hundred and fifty-first year, bringing him a golden crown and a palm branch,

**5** and besides these, some of the customary boughs of the Temple. And that day he kept silence. But having received an opportune moment as a helper for his own folly, being summoned to a council by Demetrius and being asked in what state and

**6** counsel the Jews stood, to these things he said: "Those of the Jews who are called Hasideans, whom Judas Maccabaeus leads, stir up war and faction, giving not that the kingdom should obtain stability.

**7** Wherefore, having taken away the ancestral glory –

**8** I mean the high priesthood – I am now come hither, first indeed, genuinely mindful of the king's concerns; and secondly, considering also my own citizens. For by the unreasonableness of the aforementioned [men],

**9** our whole race suffers no small misfortune. And knowing each of these things, O King, do thou provide for both the country and our encompassed race, according to the ready-to-meet benevolence which thou hast toward all.

**10** For as long as Judas remains, it is impossible

**11** for affairs to obtain peace." And when such things were spoken by him, the rest of the king's friends, being hostile towards Judas, did the more inflame Demetrius.

**12** But straightway, having called Nicanor, who had been chief of the elephants, and having appointed him general of Judea,

**13** he sent him forth; giving commands that he should indeed destroy Judas himself, and scatter those who were with him, and establish

**14** Alcimus as high priest of the most great Temple. But the nations that had encompassed Judas from Judea joined themselves in droves to Nicanor, supposing the misfortunes and calamities of the Jews would be their own prosperity.

**15** And when they heard of the coming of Nicanor and the attack of the nations, they prostrated themselves to the earth and implored

**16** Him who had established His people forever, and who ever with manifestation takes hold of His own portion. And when the leader commanded, straightway from thence, [them] to depart, and they join battle.
