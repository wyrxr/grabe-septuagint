19 ...ἐγκαταλείψει αὐτόν.
20 Χάριτας ἐγγύου μὴ ἐπιλάθῃ· ἔδωκε γὰρ τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ ὑπὲρ σοῦ.
21 Ἀγαθὰ ἐγγύου ἀνατρέψει ἁμαρτωλούς, καὶ ἀχάριστος ἐν διανοίᾳ ἐγκαταλείψει ῥυσάμενον·
22 ἐγγύη πολλοὺς ἀπώλεσε κατευθύνοντας, καὶ ἐπάλευσεν αὐτοὺς ὡς κῦμα θαλάσσης· ἄνδρας
23 δυνατοὺς ἀπώκισε, καὶ ἐπλανήθησαν ἐν ἔθνεσιν ἀλλοτρίαις. Ἀμαρτωλὸς
24 παραβαίνων ἐντολὰς Κυρίου ἐμπεσεῖται εἰς ἐγγύην, καὶ διώκων ἐργολαβείας ἐμπεσεῖται εἰς κρίσεις.
25 Ἀντιλαβοῦ τοῦ πλησίον κατὰ δύναμίν σου, καὶ πρόσεχε σεαυτῷ μὴ ἐμπέσῃς.
26 Ἀρχὴ ζωῆς ἀνθρώπου ἄρτος καὶ ὕδωρ καὶ ἱμάτιον, καὶ οἶκος καλύπτων ἀσχημοσύνην.
27 Κρείσσων βίος πτωχοῦ ὑπὸ σκέπην δοκῶν, ἢ ἔδεσμα τὰ λαμπρὰ ἐν ἀλλοτρίᾳ.
28 Ἐπὶ μικρῷ καὶ μεγάλῳ εὐδοκίαν ἔχε, καὶ ὀνειδισμὸν οἰκίας σου μὴ ἀκούσῃς.
29 Ζωὴ πονηρὰ ἐξ οἰκίας εἰς οἰκίαν, καὶ οὐ παροικήσεις, οὐκ ἀνοίξεις στόμα· ξενιεῖς καὶ ποτιεῖς ἀχάριστα, καὶ πρὸς ἐπὶ τούτοις πικρὰ ἀκούσῃ·
30 πάρελθε πάροικε, κόσμησον τράπεζαν, καὶ εἴτι ἐν τῇ χειρί σου, ψωμισόν με·
31 ἔξελθε πάροικε ἀπὸ προσώπου δόξης· ἐπεξένωταί μοι ὁ ἀδελφός, χρεία τῆς οἰκίας.
32 Βαρέα ταῦτα ἀνθρώπῳ ἔχοντι φρόνησιν, ἐπιτίμησις οἰκίας καὶ ὀνειδισμὸς δανειστοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. Λʹ. XXX.

Περὶ τέκνων.

1 Ὁ ἀγαπῶν τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ, ἐνδελεχήσει μάστιγας αὐτῷ, ἵνα
2 εὐφρανθῇ ἐπ᾿ ἐσχάτῳ αὐτοῦ. Ὁ παιδεύων τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ ἐνήσεται ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ, καὶ ἀναμέσον γνωρίμων ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ καυχήσεται·
3 ὁ διδάσκων τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ παραζηλώσει τὸν ἐχθρόν, καὶ ἔναντι φίλων
4 ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ ἀγαλλιάσεται. Ἐτελεύτησεν αὐτοῦ ὁ πατήρ, καὶ ὡς οὐκ
5 ἀπέθανεν· ὅμοιον γὰρ αὐτῷ κατέλειπε μεθ᾿ αὐτόν. Ἐν τῇ ζωῇ
6 αὐτοῦ ἴδε καὶ ηὐφράνθη, καὶ ἐν τῇ τελευτῇ αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἐλυπήθη·
7 ἐναντίον ἐχθρῶν κατέλειπεν ἔκδικον, καὶ τοῖς φίλοις ἀνταποδιδόντα χάριν.
8 Περιψύχων υἱὸν καταδεσμεύσει τραύματα αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπὶ πάσῃ βοῇ ταραχθήσεται σπλάγχνα αὐτοῦ.
9 Ἵππος ἀδάμαστος ἐκβαίνει σκληρός· καὶ υἱὸς ἀνειμένος ἐκβαίνει προαλής.
10 Τίθησον τέκνον, καὶ ἐκθαμβήσει σε· σύμπαιζον αὐτῷ καὶ λυπήσει σε.
11 Μὴ συγγελάσῃς αὐτῷ ἵνα μὴ συνοδυνηθῇς, καὶ ἐπ᾿ ἐσχάτων γομφιάσεις τοὺς ὀδόντας σου.
12 Μὴ δῷς αὐτῷ ἐξουσίαν

**Chapter Twenty-Nine**

19 ...shall abandon him.
20 Forget not the favors of a surety,
    for he hath given his life for thee.
21 The good deeds of a surety shall undo the sinful,
    and the ungrateful in [his] mind shall abandon him that rescued him.
22 Suretyship hath destroyed many who walked uprightly,
    and hath tossed them about as a wave of the sea;
23 mighty men hath it banished,
    and they have wandered in foreign nations.
24 A sinner who transgresseth the commandments of the Lord
    shall fall into suretyship,
    and he that pursueth [great] undertakings shall fall into judgments.
25 Help thy neighbor according to thy power,
    and take heed to thyself lest thou fall.
26 The beginning of man's life is bread and water and raiment,
    and a house covering [his] nakedness.
27 Better is the life of a poor man beneath a covering of beams,
    than sumptuous fare in a strange land.
28 Be content with little and much,
    and hear not the reproach [against] thy house.
29 A wicked life it is to wander from house to house;
    and thou shalt not sojourn, neither shalt thou open thy mouth;
    thou shalt be entertained and drink ungraciously,
    and in addition to these things shalt thou hear bitter words.
30 [One will say:] "Come hither, sojourner, set the table,
    and if there be aught in thy hand, feed me!"
31 [Another will say:] "Depart, sojourner, from the presence of [my] glory;
    for my brother is come to sojourn with me, and I have need of the house."
32 These things are grievous to a man of understanding:
    the rebuke of a householder and the reproach of a lender.

**Chapter Thirty**

**Concerning Children**

1 He that loveth his son shall apply scourges unto him continually,
    that he may rejoice in him in his latter end.
2 He that chasteneth his son shall have joy in him,
    and among his acquaintances shall he boast of him.
3 He that teacheth his son shall make his enemy envious,
    and before his friends
4 shall he rejoice in him.
    His father died, and it is as though he died not;
5 for he hath left a like one with him.
    In his life he saw him and was glad,
6 and in his death he was not grieved;
7 against his enemies he hath left an avenger,
    and to his friends one who returneth favor.
8 He that pampereth his son shall bind up his wounds,
    and at every cry shall his heart be troubled.
9 An untamed horse turneth out headstrong;
    and a son left unrestrained turneth out insolent.
10 Set thy child free, and he shall confound thee;
    play with him, and he shall grieve thee.
11 Laugh not with him, lest thou grieve with him,
    and at the last shalt thou gnash thy teeth.
12 Give him not authority
