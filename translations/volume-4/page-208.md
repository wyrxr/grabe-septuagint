**ΜΑΚΚΑΒΑΙΩΝ Δ´. ΚΕΦ. Ι´.**

**1** ΚΑΙ τούτου τὸν ἀοίδιμον θάνατον καρτερήσαντος, ὁ τρίτος
ᾕγετο, παρακαλούμενος πολλὰ ὑπὸ πολλῶν, ὅπως ἀπογευσάμενος
**2** σώζοιτο. Ὁ δὲ ἀναβοήσας, ἔφη· ἦ ἀγνοεῖτε, ὅτι ὁ αὐτός με
**3** τοῖς ἀποθανοῦσιν ἔσπειρεν πατήρ, καὶ ἡ αὐτὴ μήτηρ ἐγέννησεν,
εὐγενῆ τῆς ἀδελφότητός μου συγγένειαν. Πρὸς ταῦτα εἴ τι ἔχετε
**4** κολαστήριον προσαγάγετε τῷ σώματί μου· τῆς γὰρ ψυχῆς μου,
**5** οὐδ᾽ ἂν θέλητε, ἅψασθαι (δύνασθε). Οἱ δὲ πικρῶς ἐνέγκαντες τὴν
**6** παρρησίαν τοῦ ἀνδρός, ἀρθρεμβόλοις ὀργάνοις τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ
καὶ τοὺς πόδας ἐξήρθρουν, καὶ ἐξ ὀστέων ἀναμοχλεύοντες ἐξεμέ-
λιζον, καὶ τοὺς δακτύλους, καὶ τοὺς βραχίνας, καὶ τὰ σκέλη,
**7** καὶ τοὺς ἀγκῶνας περιέκλων. Καὶ κατὰ μηδένα τρόπον ἰσχύοντες
αὐτὸν ἄγξαι, περισύραντες τὸ δέρμα σὺν ἄκραις ταῖς τῶν
δακτύλων κορυφαῖς ἀπεσκύθιζον, καὶ εὐθέως ἦγον ἐπὶ τὸν τροχόν.
**8** Περὶ ὃν ἐκ σφονδύλων ἐκμελιζόμενος ἑώρα τὰς ἑαυτοῦ σάρκας
περιπλακιζομένας καὶ κατὰ σπλάγχων σταγόνας αἵματος ἀποῤῥεού-
**9** σας. Μέλλων δὲ ἀποθνήσκειν, ἔφη· Ἡμεῖς μὲν ὦ μιαρώτατε,
**10** τύραννε, διὰ παιδείαν καὶ ἀρετὴν Θεοῦ ταῦτα πάσχομεν. Σὺ
**11** δὲ διὰ τὴν ἀσέβειαν καὶ μισοφωνίαν, ἀκαταλύτους καρτερήσεις
**12** βασάνους. Καὶ τούτου θανόντος ἀδελφοπρεπῶς, τὸν τέταρτον
**13** ἐπεσπῶντο, λέγοντες· Μὴ συμμαχῆς καὶ σὺ τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς σου
**14** τὴν αὐτὴν μανίαν· ἀλλὰ πεισθεὶς τῷ βασιλεῖ, σῶζε σεαυτόν. Ὁ δὲ
**15** αὐτοῖς ἔφη· οὐχ οὕτως καυστικώτερον ἔχετε κατ᾽ ἐμοῦ τὸ πῦρ,
**16** ὥστε με δειλανδρῆσαι. Μὴ τὸν μακάριον τῶν ἀδελφῶν μου θά-
**17** νατον, καὶ τὸν αἰώνιον τοῦ τυράννου ὄλεθρον, καὶ τὸν ἀοίδιμον
τῶν εὐσεβῶν βίον, οὐκ ἀρνήσομαι τὴν εὐγενῆ ἀδελφότητα. Ἐπινόει,
**18** τύραννε, βασάνους· ἵνα καὶ διὰ τούτων μάθῃς, ὅτι ἀδελφός εἰμι τῶν
προβασανισθέντων. Ταῦτα ἀκούσας ὁ αἱμοβόρος καὶ φωνώδης καὶ
**19** παμιαρώτατος Ἀντίοχος, ἐκέλευσεν τὴν γλῶτταν αὐτοῦ ἐκτεμεῖν.
**20** Ὁ δὲ ἔφη· κἄν ἀφέλῃς τὸ τῆς φωνῆς ἔργανον, καὶ σιωπώντων
ἀκούει ὁ Θεός. Ἰδοὺ προκεχάλασται ἡ γλῶσσα· τέμνε. οὐ
γὰρ παρὰ τοῦτο τὸν λογισμὸν ἡμῶν γλωσσοτομήσεις. Ἡδέως
**21** ὑπὲρ τοῦ νόμου τοῦ Θεοῦ τὰ τοῦ σώματος μέλη ἀκρωτηριαζόμεθα.

**CHAPTER X.**

**1** And when this one had endured his glorious death, the third
was led forth, being entreated much by many, that he might taste [of the forbidden food]
**2** and be saved. But he, having cried out, did say: "Do ye not know
**3** that the same Father did sow me who have died, and the same Mother gave me birth,
[unto] a noble kinship of my brotherhood? Unto these things, if ye have any
**4** instrument of torment, bring it forth unto my body; for of my soul,
**5** not even if ye wish, are ye able to touch [it]." But they, having bitterly resented
**6** the boldness of the man, with joint-dislocating instruments did dislocate his hands
and his feet; and prying [them] up from the bones, they did dismember [him],
both his fingers, and his arms, and his legs,
**7** and did twist his elbows. And being unable in any wise to overpower him,
they flayed off his skin with the very tips of his fingers,
and straightway they led him unto the wheel.
**8** About which, being dismembered from his vertebrae, he did behold his own flesh
being wrapped around, and drops of blood flowing down upon his entrails.
**9** And being about to die, he did say: "We, O most utterly defiled
**10** tyrant, do suffer these things for the sake of the discipline and virtue of God. But thou,
**11** for thy impiety and hatred of the Divine Word, shalt endure unceasing
**12** torments." And when this one also had died in a manner worthy of his brethren, the fourth
**13** they did drag forth, saying: "Do not thou also ally thyself with thy brethren
**14** in the same madness; but rather, having obeyed the king, save thyself." But he
**15** did say unto them: "Not so much more fiercely burning have ye the fire against me
**16** as to make me play the coward. Shall I deny the blessed death of my brethren,
**17** and the eternal destruction of the tyrant, and the glorious life of the pious?
Nay, I will not deny this noble brotherhood. Devise thou,
**18** O tyrant, [more] torments; that even through these thou mayest learn,
that I am brother unto those who were tortured aforetime."
Having heard these things, the bloodthirsty and loud-voiced and
**19** most utterly defiled Antiochus, did command that his tongue be cut out.
**20** But he did say: "Even if thou take away the instrument of [my] voice,
yet God heareth even those who are silent. Behold,
my tongue is stretched forth; cut it. For thou shalt not,
because of this, silence our reason. Gladly
**21** for the law of God are we dismembered in the members of our body."
