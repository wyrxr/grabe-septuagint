σου παιδία ἐκ Σάρρας τῆς θυγατρός μου, ἵνα εὐφρανθῶ ἐνώπιον
τοῦ Κυρίου. καὶ ἰδοὺ παρατίθεμαί σοι τὴν θυγατέρα μου ἐν πα-
ρακαταθήκῃ, μὴ λυπήσῃς αὐτήν. Μετὰ ταῦτα ἐπορεύετο, καὶ 13
Τωβίας εὐλογῶν τὸν Θεόν, ὅτι εὐώδωσε τὴν ὁδὸν αὐτοῦ· καὶ
κατευλογεῖ Ῥαγουὴλ καὶ ῎Εδναν τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ. καὶ ἐπο-
ρεύετο μέχρις οὗ ἐγγίσαι αὐτοὺς εἰς Νινευή.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΑ΄. ΧΙ.

ΚΑΙ εἶπε Ῥαφαὴλ πρὸς Τωβίαν· οὐ γινώσκεις, ἀδελφέ, πῶς 1
ἀφῆκας τὸν πατέρα σου; Προδράμωμεν ἔμπροσθεν τῆς γυναικὸς 2
σου, καὶ ἑτοιμάσωμεν τὴν οἰκίαν· λαβὲ δὲ παρὰ χεῖρα τὴν χολὴν 3
τοῦ ἰχθύος. καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν, καὶ συνῆλθεν ὁ κύων ὄπισθεν αὐτῶν.
Καὶ ῎Αννα ἐκάθητο περιβλεπομένη εἰς τὴν ὁδὸν τὸν παῖδα αὐ- 4
τῆς, καὶ προσενόησεν αὐτὸν ἐρχόμενον, καὶ εἶπε τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ· 5
ἰδοὺ ὁ υἱός σου ἔρχεται, καὶ ὁ ἄνθρωπος ὁ πορευθεὶς μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ.
Καὶ Ῥαφαὴλ εἶπεν· ἐπίσταμαι ἐγώ, Τωβία, ὅτι ἀνοίξει τοὺς ὀ- 6
φθαλμοὺς ὁ πατήρ σου. Σὺ οὖν ἔγχρισον τὴν χολὴν εἰς τοὺς ὀ- 7
φθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ, καὶ δηχθεὶς διατρίψει, καὶ ἀποβαλεῖ τὰ λευκώ-
ματα, καὶ ὄψεται σε. Καὶ προσδραμοῦσα ῎Αννα ἔπεσεν ἐπὶ τὸν 8
τράχηλον τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτῆς, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· ἴδον σε, παιδίον, ἀπὸ
τοῦ νῦν ἀποθανοῦμαι· καὶ ἐκλαῦσαν ἀμφότεροι. Καὶ Τωβίτ ἐξήρ- 9
χετο πρὸς τὴν θύραν, καὶ προσέκοπτεν· ὁ δὲ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ προσέ-
δραμεν αὐτῷ, καὶ ἐπελάβετο τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ προσέπα- 10
σε τὴν χολὴν ἐπὶ τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ, λέγων·
θάρσει, πάτερ. Ὡς δὲ συνεδήχθησαν, διέτριψε τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐ- 11
τοῦ, καὶ ἐλεπίσθη ἀπὸ τῶν κάνθων τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν αὐτοῦ τὰ λευ- 12
κώματα· καὶ ἰδὼν τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ ἔπεσεν ἐπὶ τὸν τράχηλον αὐτοῦ,
καὶ ἔκλαυσε, καὶ εἶπεν· εὐλογητὸς εἶ ὁ Θεός, καὶ εὐλογητὸν τὸ 13
ὄνομά σου εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας, καὶ εὐλογημένοι πάντες οἱ ἅγιοί σου
ἄγγελοι, ὅτι ἐμαστίγωσας καὶ ἠλέησας με. ἰδοὺ βλέπω Τωβίαν 14
τὸν υἱόν μου· καὶ εἰσῆλθεν ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ χαίρων, καὶ ἀπήγγειλε
τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ τὰ μεγαλεῖα τὰ γενόμενα αὐτῷ ἐν τῇ Μηδίᾳ.
Καὶ ἐξῆλθε Τωβὶτ εἰς συνάντησιν τῇ νύμφῃ αὐτοῦ χαίρων καὶ 15
εὐλογῶν τὸν Θεὸν πρὸς τῇ πύλῃ Νινευή· καὶ ἐθαύμαζον οἱ θεω-
ροῦντες αὐτὸν πορευόμενον, ὅτι ἔβλεψε. Καὶ Τωβὶτ ἐξωμολογεῖ- 16

[Tobit 11:1]
THEN said Raphael unto Tobias, "Knowest thou not, brother, how thou didst leave thy father?"

[Tobit 11:2]
"Let us run forward before thy wife, and let us prepare the house."

[Tobit 11:3]
"But take thou into thy hand the gall of the fish." And they departed, and the dog followed them.

[Tobit 11:4]
And Anna sat, looking forth upon the way for her son,

[Tobit 11:5]
and she perceived him coming, and said unto his father, "Behold, thy son cometh, and the man who went with him!"

[Tobit 11:6]
And Raphael said, "I know, O Tobias, that thy father shall open his eyes.

[Tobit 11:7]
Thou, therefore, anoint the gall upon his eyes; and when he is stung [thereby], he shall rub [them], and the films shall fall away, and he shall see thee."

[Tobit 11:8]

[Tobit 11:11]
And when his eyes were stung thereby, he rubbed them,

[Tobit 11:12]
and the films fell away from the corners of his eyes; and seeing his son, he fell upon his neck,

[Tobit 11:13]
and wept, and said, "Blessed art Thou, O God, and blessed be Thy Name for ever and ever, and blessed be all Thy holy angels, for Thou hast chastened and hadst mercy upon me.
