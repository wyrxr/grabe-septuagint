**ΚΕΦ. ΙΑʹ.** ΜΑΚΚΑΒΑΙΩΝ Αʹ. 1647
θυμῆσαι αὐτὸν τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἀφελόμενος αὐτοῦ 12
τὴν θυγατέρα, ἔδωκεν αὐτὴν τῷ Δημητρίῳ, καὶ ἠλλοιώθη
τὸ πρόσωπον Ἀλεξάνδρου, καὶ ἐφάνη ἔχθρα αὐτῶν. Καὶ 13
εἰσῆλθε Πτολεμαῖος εἰς Ἀντιόχειαν, καὶ περιέθετο τὸ διά-
δημα τῆς Ἀσίας, καὶ περιέθετο δύο διαδήματα περὶ τὴν κε-
φαλὴν αὐτοῦ, τὸ τῆς Ἀσίας καὶ Αἰγύπτου. Ἀλέξανδρος δὲ 14
ὁ βασιλεὺς ἦν εἰς Κιλικίαν κατὰ τοὺς καιροὺς ἐκείνους, ὅτι
ἀπεστάτουν οἱ ἀπὸ τῶν τόπων ἐκείνων. Καὶ ἤκουσεν Ἀλέξαν- 15
δρος, καὶ ἦλθεν ἐπ’ αὐτὸν ἐν πολέμῳ. Καὶ ἐξήγαγε Πτολεμαῖος
τὴν δύναμιν, καὶ ἀπήντησεν αὐτῷ ἐν χειρὶ ἰσχυρᾷ, καὶ ἐτροπώ-
σατο αὐτόν. Καὶ ἔφυγεν Ἀλέξανδρος εἰς τὴν Ἀραβίαν, τοῦ 16
σκεπασθῆναι αὐτὸν ἐκεῖ· ὁ δὲ βασιλεὺς Πτολεμαῖος ὑψώθη. Καὶ 17
ἀφεῖλε Ζαβδεὴλ ὁ Ἄραψ τὴν κεφαλὴν Ἀλεξάνδρου, καὶ ἀπέστειλε
τῷ Πτολεμαίῳ. Καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς Πτολεμαῖος ἀπέθανεν ἐν τῇ 18
ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τρίτῃ, καὶ οἱ ὄντες ἐν τοῖς ὀχυρώμασιν αὐτοῦ ἀπώ-
λοντο ὑπὸ τῶν ἐν τοῖς ὀχυρώμασι. Καὶ ἐβασίλευσε Δημήτριος 19
ἔτους ἑβδόμου καὶ ἑξηκοστοῦ καὶ ἑκατοστοῦ. Ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις 20
ἐκείναις συνήγαγεν Ἰωνάθαν τοὺς ἐκ τῆς Ἰουδαίας, τοῦ ἐκπολε-
μῆσαι τὴν ἄκραν τὴν ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ, καὶ ἐποίησεν ἐπ’ αὐτὴν
μηχανὰς πολλὰς. Καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν τινες μισοῦντες τὸ ἔθνος αὐ- 21
τῶν ἄνδρες παράνομοι πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα, καὶ ἀπήγγειλαν αὐτῷ,
ὅτι Ἰωνάθαν περικάθηται τὴν ἄκραν. Καὶ ἀκούσας ὠργίσθη, ὡς 22
δὲ ἤκουσιν, εὐθέως ἀναζεύξας ἦλθεν εἰς Πτολεμαΐδα, καὶ ἔγρα-
ψεν Ἰωνάθαν, τοῦ μὴ περικαθῆσθαι τῇ ἄκρᾳ, καὶ τοῦ ἀπαντῆ-
σαι αὐτὸν αὐτῷ συμμίγειν εἰς Πτολεμαΐδα τὴν ταχίστην. Ὡς 23
δὲ ἤκουσεν Ἰωνάθαν, ἐκέλευσε περικαθῆσθαι, καὶ ἐπέλεξε τῶν
πρεσβυτέρων Ἰσραὴλ καὶ τῶν ἱερέων, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὸν τῷ κιν-
δύνῳ. Καὶ λαβὼν ἀργύριον καὶ χρυσίον καὶ ἱματισμὸν καὶ ἕτερα 24
ξένια πλείονα, καὶ ἐπορεύθη πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα εἰς Πτολεμαΐδα.
Τινὲς ἄνομοι τῶν ἐκ τοῦ ἔθνους, καὶ ἐνετύγχανον κατ’ αὐτοῦ. 25
Καὶ ἐποίησεν αὐτῷ ὁ βασιλεύς. 26
Καλῶς ἐποίησαν αὐτῷ οἱ πρὸ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὕψωσεν αὐτὸν ἐναντίον
πάντων τῶν φίλων αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἔστησεν αὐτῷ τὴν ἀρχιερωσύ- 27
νην, καὶ ὅσα ἄλλα εἶχε τίμια πρότερον, καὶ ἐποίησεν αὐτὸν
τῶν πρώτων φίλων ἡγεῖσθαι. Καὶ ἠξίωσεν Ἰωνάθαν τὸν βασιλέα 28
