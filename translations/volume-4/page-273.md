ΜΑΚΑΡΙΟΣ ἀνὴρ ὃς οὐκ ὠλίσθησεν ἐν τῷ στόματι αὑτοῦ, καὶ οὐ κατεπόθη ἐν λύπῃ ἁμαρτιῶν· μακάριος ἀνὴρ οὗ οὐ κατέγνω ἡ ψυχὴ αὑτοῦ, καὶ ὃς οὐκ ἔπεσεν ἀπὸ τῆς ἐλπίδος αὑτοῦ. Ἀνδρὶ μικρολόγῳ οὐ καλὸς ὁ πλοῦτος, καὶ ἀνθρώπῳ βασκάνῳ ἵνα τί χρήματα; Ὁ συνάγων ἀπὸ τῆς ψυχῆς αὑτοῦ, συνάγει ἄλλοις, καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἀγαθοῖς αὑτοῦ τρυφήσουσιν ἕτεροι. Ὁ πονηρὸς ἑαυτῷ, τίνι ἀγαθὸς ἔσται; καὶ οὐ μὴ εὐφρανθήσεται ἐν τοῖς χρήμασιν αὑτοῦ τοῦ βυσκαίνοντος ἑαυτὸν οὐκ ἔστι πονηρότερος· καὶ τοῦτο ἀνταπόδομα τῆς κακίας αὑτοῦ· κἂν εὐποιῇ, ἐν λήθῃ ποιεῖ, καὶ ἐπ᾽ ἐσχάτων ἐκφαίνει τὴν κακίαν αὑτοῦ· πονηρὸς δ᾽ βυσκαίνων ὀφθαλμῷ ἑαυτοῦ, ἀποστρέφων πρόσωπον καὶ ὑπερορῶν ψυχάς. Πλεονέκτου δὲ ὀφθαλμὸς οὐκ ἐμπίπλαται μερίδος, καὶ ἀδικία πονηρὰ ἀναξηραίνει ψυχήν. Ὀφθαλμὸς πονηρὸς φθονερὸς ἐπ᾽ ἄρτῳ, καὶ ἐλλιπὴς ἐπὶ τῆς τραπέζης αὑτοῦ. Τέκνον, καθὼς ἐὰν ἔχῃς εὐποΐει σαυτόν, καὶ προσφορὰς Κυρίῳ ἀξίως πρόσαγε· μνήσθητι ὅτι θάνατος οὐ χρονιεῖ, καὶ διαθήκη ᾅδου οὐχ ὑπεδείχθη σοι· πρίν σε τελευτῆσαι εὐποΐει φίλῳ, καὶ κατὰ τὴν ἰσχύν σου ἔκτεινον καὶ δὸς αὑτῷ. Μὴ ἀφυστέρησης ἀπὸ ἀγαθῆς ἡμέρας, καὶ μερὶς ἐπιθυμίας ἀγαθῆς μή σε παρελθέτω. Οὐχὶ ἑταίροις καταλείψεις τοὺς πόνους σου, καὶ τοὺς κόπους σου εἰς διαιρέσεις κλήρων; Δὸς καὶ λάβε, καὶ ἁγίασον τὴν ψυχήν σου, ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν ᾅδῃ ζητῆσαι τρυφήν, πᾶσα σὰρξ ὡς ἱμάτιον παλαιοῦται· ἡ γὰρ διαθήκη ἀπ᾽ αἰῶνος· θανάτῳ ἀποθανῇ. Ὡς φύλλον θάλλον ἐπὶ δένδρου δασέος, τὰ μὲν καταβάλλει, ἀλλὰ δὲ φύει· οὕτως καὶ γενεὰ σαρκὸς καὶ αἵματος, ἡ μὲν τελευτᾷ, ἑτέρα δὲ γεννᾶται. Πᾶν ἔργον σηπόμενον ἐκλείπει, καὶ ὁ ἐργαζόμενος αὐτὸ μετ᾽ αὑτοῦ ἀπελεύσεται. Μακάριος ἀνὴρ ὃς ἐν σοφίᾳ μελετήσει, καὶ ὃς ἐν συνέσει αὑτοῦ διαλεχθήσεται· διανοούμενος τὰς ὁδοὺς αὑτῆς ἐν καρδίᾳ αὑτοῦ, καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἀποκρύφοις αὑτῆς ἐννοηθήσεται. Ἐξελθε ὀπίσω αὐτῆς ὡς ἰχνευτής, καὶ ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὑτῆς ἐνέδρευε. Ὁ παρακύπτων διὰ τῶν θυρίδων αὑτῆς, καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν θυρωμάτων αὑτῆς ἀκροάσεται· ὁ καταλύων σύνεγγυς τοῦ οἴκου αὑτῆς, καὶ πήξει πάσσαλον ἐν τοῖς τοίχοις αὑτῆς· στήσει τὴν σκηνὴν αὑτοῦ

Blessed is the man who hath not stumbled by his mouth, and hath not been swallowed up in the sorrow of sins; blessed is the man whose soul hath not condemned him, and who hath not fallen from his hope.

For a man of a stingy spirit, wealth is not good; and for an envious man, to what end are riches? He that gathereth from his own soul, gathereth for others; and in his good things shall others take delight. He that is wicked unto himself, unto whom shall he be good? Neither shall he rejoice in his riches. There is none more wicked than he that begrudgeth himself; and this is the recompense of his wickedness. And though he do good, he doeth it in forgetfulness, and at the last he revealeth his wickedness. But a wicked man, grudging with his own eye, turneth away his face and despiseth souls.

But the eye of a covetous man is not filled with [any] portion; and wicked injustice doth wither the soul. An evil eye is envious over bread, and wanteth at his own table.

My son, according as thou hast, deal bountifully with thyself, and bring offerings unto the Lord worthily. Remember that death shall not tarry, and the decree of Hades was not revealed unto thee. Before thou diest, deal bountifully with a friend, and according to thy strength, stretch forth [thy hand] and give unto him. Fail not of a good day, and let not the portion of a good desire pass thee by. Shalt thou not leave thy labours and thy toils unto companions, for the dividing of inheritances? Give and receive, and sanctify thy soul; for it is not in Hades to seek delight. All flesh doth wax old like a garment; for the decree [hath stood] from everlasting: "By death shalt thou die." As a flourishing leaf upon a thick tree, some it casteth down, yet others it bringeth forth; so also a generation of flesh and blood, some die, but another is born. Every decaying work doth perish, and he that doeth it shall depart with it.

Blessed is the man who shall meditate in wisdom, and who shall commune in his understanding; pondering her ways within his heart, and in her hidden things shall he be mindful. Go forth after her as a tracker, and in her ways lie thou in wait. He that peereth through her windows, and at her door-posts shall he hearken. He that lodgeth nigh unto her house, and he shall pitch a peg within her walls; he shall pitch his tent
