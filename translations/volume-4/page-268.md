ΙΗΣΟΥ ΥΙΟΥ ΣΙΡΑΧ 1799
ΚΕΦ. Ι΄. Χ.
`1.` ΚΡΙΤΗΣ σοφὸς παιδεύσει τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἡγεμονία συνετοῦ τεταγμένη ἔσται.
`2.` Κατὰ τὸν κριτὴν τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ, οὕτως οἱ λειτουργοὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ κατὰ τὸν ἡγούμενον τῆς πόλεως πάντες οἱ κατοικοῦντες αὐτήν.
`3.` Βασιλεὺς ἀπαίδευτος ἀπολεῖ τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ· καὶ πόλις οἰκισθήσεται ἐν συνέσει δυναστῶν.
`4.` Ἐν χειρὶ Κυρίου ἡ ἐξουσία τῆς γῆς, καὶ τὸν χρήσιμον ἐγερεί εἰς καιρὸν ἐπ᾽ αὐτῆς.
`5.` Ἐν χειρὶ Κυρίου εὐοδία ἀνδρός, καὶ προσώπῳ γραμματέως ἐπιθήσει δόξαν αὐτοῦ.
`6.` Ἐπὶ παντὶ ἀδικήματι μὴ μηνίσης τῷ πλησίον, καὶ μὴ πράσσε μηδὲν ἐν ἔργοις ὕβρεως.
`7.` Μισητὴ ἔναντι Κυρίου καὶ ἀνθρώπων ὑπερηφανία, καὶ ἐξ ἀμφοτέρων πλημμελήσει ἄδικα.
`8.` Βασιλεία ἀπὸ ἔθνους εἰς ἔθνος μετάγεται, διὰ ἀδικίας καὶ ὕβρεις καὶ χρήματα δόλια.
`9.` Φιλαργύρου μὲν γὰρ οὐδὲν ἀνομώτερον· οὗτος γὰρ καὶ τὴν ἑαυτοῦ ψυχὴν ἔκπρακτον ποιεῖ.
`10.` Τί ὑπερηφανεύεται γῆ καὶ σποδός ; ὅτι ἐν ζωῇ ἐρρίφθαι τὰ ἐνδόσθια αὐτοῦ, μακρὸν ἀρρώστημα σκώπτει ἰατρός· καὶ βασιλεὺς σήμερον καὶ αὔριον τελευτήσει·
`11.` ἐν γὰρ τῷ ἀποθανεῖν ἄνθρωπον, κληρονομήσει ἑρπετὰ καὶ θηρία καὶ σκώληκας.
`12.` Ἀρχὴ ὑπερηφανίας ἀνθρώπου ἀφισταμένου ἀπὸ Κυρίου, καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ ποιήσαντος αὐτὸν ἀπέστη ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ·
`13.` ὅτι ἀρχὴ ὑπερηφανίας ἁμαρτία, καὶ ὁ κρατῶν αὐτῆς ἐξομβρήσει βδέλυγμα.
`14.` Διὰ τοῦτο παρεδόξασε Κύριος τὰς ἐπαγωγάς, καὶ κατέστρεψεν εἰς τέλος αὐτούς· θρόνους ἀρχόντων καθεῖλεν ὁ Κύριος, καὶ ἐκάθισε πραεῖς ἀντ᾽ αὐτῶν·
`15.` ἐφύτευσεν ἔθνη ὑπερηφάνων ἐξέτιλεν ὁ Κύριος, καὶ ἐφύτευσε ταπεινοὺς ἀντ᾽ αὐτῶν·
`16.` χώρας ἐθνῶν κατέστρεψεν ὁ Κύριος, καὶ ἀπώλεσεν αὐτὰς ἕως θεμελίων γῆς·
`17.` ἔξηρεν αὐτοὺς καὶ ἀπώλεσεν αὐτούς, καὶ κατέπαυσεν ἀπὸ γῆς τὸ μνημόσυνον αὐτῶν.
`18.` Οὐκ ἔκτισται ἀνθρώποις ὑπερηφανία, οὐδὲ ὀργὴ θυμοῦ γεννήμασι γυναικῶν.
`19.` Σπέρμα ἔντιμον ποῖον ; σπέρμα ἀνθρώπου σπέρμα ἔντιμον ποῖον ; οἱ φοβούμενοι τὸν Κύριον· σπέρμα ἄτιμον ποῖον ; σπέρμα ἀνθρώπου σπέρμα ἄτιμον ποῖον ; οἱ παραβαίνοντες ἐντολάς.
`20.` Ἐν μέσῳ ἀδελφῶν ὁ ἡγούμενος αὐτῶν ἔντιμος, καὶ οἱ φοβούμενοι Κύριον ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτοῦ.
`21.` Πρὸ λήξεως ἀρχῆς φόβος Κυρίου· ἐκβολὴ δὲ ἀρχῆς σκληρισμὸς καὶ ὑπερηφανία.
`22.` Πλούσιος καὶ ἔνδοξος καὶ πτωχός, τὸ καύχημα αὐτῶν φόβος Κυρίου.
`23.` Οὐ δίκαιον ἀτιμάσαι πτωχὸν συνετὸν, καὶ

**Chapter Ten**

`1` A judge that is wise shall instruct his people, and the dominion of an understanding man shall be well-ordered.
`2` According to the judge of his people, so also are his ministers; and according to the ruler of a city, so are all they that dwell therein.
`3` An uninstructed king shall destroy his people; and a city shall be built up through the understanding of potentates.
`4` In the hand of the Lord is the authority of the earth; and a profitable man shall He raise up in due season upon it.
`5` In the hand of the Lord is the prosperity of a man, and upon the face of a scribe shall He lay His glory.

`6` For every wrongdoing, be not thou wroth with thy neighbor, and do thou naught in works of insolence.
`7` Hateful before the Lord and men is arrogance, and against both shall a man commit unjust deeds.
`8` A kingdom is transferred from one nation unto another, because of injustices and insolence and deceitful riches.
`9` For naught is more lawless than a lover of money; for this man doth even render his own soul an object of extortion.

`10` Why doth earth and ashes boast? [Is it] that in life his entrails have been cast out? A long sickness doth mock the physician; and a king today and tomorrow shall die.
`11` For when a man dieth, he shall inherit reptiles and beasts and worms.
`12` The beginning of a man's arrogance is his departing from the Lord, and from Him that made him his heart hath turned away.
`13` For the beginning of arrogance is sin, and he that holdeth fast to it shall pour forth abomination.
`14` Because of this, the Lord hath magnified His visitations, and hath overthrown them utterly. The Lord hath pulled down the thrones of rulers, and hath seated the meek in their stead.
`15` The Lord planted nations; [yet] nations of the proud hath the Lord plucked up, and He hath planted the humble in their stead.
`16` The Lord hath overthrown the lands of nations, and hath destroyed them unto the foundations of the earth.
`17` He dried them up and destroyed them, and made their memorial cease from the earth.
`18` Arrogance hath not been created for men, neither wrath of fury for the offspring of women.

`19` What [then is] a worthy seed? What [then is] the worthy seed of man? They that fear the Lord. What [then is] an unworthy seed? What [then is] the unworthy seed of man? They that transgress the commandments.
`20` Among brethren, he that is their leader is honorable, and they that fear the Lord are honorable in his eyes.
`21` Before the termination of authority is the fear of the Lord; but the casting out of authority is stubbornness and arrogance.
`22` Rich and glorious and poor, their boasting is the fear of the Lord.
`23` It is not just to dishonor a poor man that is understanding, and
