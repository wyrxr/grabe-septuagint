**ΚΕΦ. Ζ'. ΜΑΚΚΑΒΑΙΩΝ Β'.**
**37** πατρίων νόμων, ἐπικαλούμενος τὸν Θεὸν ἵλεων ταχὺ τῷ ἔθνει γενέσθαι, καὶ σὲ μετὰ ἐτασμῶν καὶ μαστίγων ἐξομολογήσασθαι,
**38** διότι μόνος αὐτῆς Θεὸς ἐστίν. Ἐν ἐμοὶ δὲ καὶ τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς μου στῆναι τὴν τοῦ παντοκράτορος ὀργὴν τὴν ἐπὶ τὸ σύμπαν
**39** ἡμῶν γένος δικαίως ἐπηγμένην. Ἔκθυμος δὲ γενόμενος ὁ βασιλεὺς τούτῳ παρὰ τοὺς ἄλλους χειρίστως ἀπήντησε πικρῶς φέρων
**40** ἐπὶ τῷ μυκτηρισμῷ. Καὶ οὗτος οὖν καθαρῶς τὸν βίον μετήλλαξε,
**41** παντελῶς ἐπὶ τῷ Κυρίῳ πεποιθώς. Ἐσχάτη δὲ τῶν
**42** υἱῶν ἡ μήτηρ ἐτελεύτησε. Τὰ μὲν οὖν περὶ τῶν σπλαγχνισμῶν καὶ τὰς ὑπερβαλλούσας αἰκίας ἐπὶ τοσοῦτον δεδηλώσθω.

**ΚΕΦ. Η'. VIII.**

**1** ΙΟΥΔΑΣ δὲ ὁ καὶ Μακκαβαῖος καὶ οἱ σὺν αὐτῷ παρεισπορευόμενοι λεληθότως εἰς τὰς κώμας προσεκαλοῦτο συγγενεῖς, καὶ τοὺς μεμενηκότας ἐν τῷ Ἰουδαϊσμῷ προσλαμβανόμενοι συνήγαγον
**2** εἰς ἑξακισχιλίους. Καὶ ἐπεκαλοῦντο τὸν Κύριον ἐπιδεῖν τὸν ὑπὸ πάντων καταπατούμενον λαὸν, οἰκτεῖραι δὲ καὶ τὸν ναὸν
**3** τὸν ὑπὸ τῶν ἀσεβῶν ἀνθρώπων βεβηλωθέντα. Ἐλεῆσαι δὲ καὶ τὴν καταφθειρομένην πόλιν καὶ μέλλουσαν ἰσόπεδον γίνεσθαι, καὶ
**4** τῶν καταβοώντων πρὸς αὐτὸν αἱμάτων εἰσακοῦσαι· καὶ μνησθῆναι δὲ καὶ τῆς τῶν ἀναμαρτήτων νηπίων παρανόμου ἀπωλείας· καὶ περὶ τῶν γενομένων εἰς τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ βλασφημιῶν,
**5** καὶ μισοπονηρῆσαι. Γενόμενος δὲ ὁ Μακκαβαῖος ἐν συστήματι ἀνυπόστατος ἤδη τοῖς ἔθνεσιν ἐγίνετο, τῆς ὀργῆς τοῦ Κυρίου
**6** εἰς ἔλεον τραπεὶσης. Πόλεις δὲ καὶ κώμας ἀπροσδοκήτως ἐρχόμενος ἐνεπίμπρα, καὶ τοὺς ἐπικαίρους τόπους ἀπολαμβάνων
**7** οὐκ ὀλίγους τῶν πολεμίων ἐνίκα τροπούμενος. Μάλιστα τὰς νύκτας πρὸς τὰς τοιαύτας ἐπιβολὰς συνεργοὺς ἐλάμβανε· καὶ λαλιά τις τῆς εὐανδρίας αὐτοῦ διεχεῖτο πανταχῆ.
**8** Συνορῶν δὲ ὁ Φίλιππος κατὰ μικρὸν εἰς προκοπὴν ἐρχόμενον τὸν ἄνδρα, πυκνότερον δὲ ἐν ταῖς εὐημερίαις προβαίνοντα, πρὸς Πτολεμαῖον τὸν Κοίλης Συρίας καὶ Φοινίκης στρατηγὸν ἔγραψεν ἐπιβοηθεῖν
**9** τοῖς τοῦ βασιλέως πράγμασιν. Ὁ δὲ ταχέως προχειρισάμενος Νικάνορα, τὸν τοῦ Πατρόκλου τῶν πρώτων φίλων ἀπέστειλεν, ὑποτάξας παμφύλων ἔθνη οὐκ ἐλάττους τῶν δισμυρίων, τὸ πᾶν

#### CHAPTER VII.

**37** fathers' laws, calling upon God that He would quickly become merciful unto the nation, and that He would make thee to confess with sore chastisements and scourges,
**38** for He alone is her God. And that in me and in my brethren, the wrath of the Almighty, which hath been justly brought upon all our generation, might be stayed."

**39** Then the king, becoming exceedingly wroth, handled him worse than all the others, bearing grievously his mocking. **40** And this one also, therefore, departed his life undefiled, having put his whole trust in the Lord. **41** And last of all the sons, the mother deceased. **42** Now therefore, concerning the profound sufferings and the exceeding tortures, let this much be declared.

#### CHAPTER VIII.

**1** But Judas, who also was called Maccabaeus, and they that were with him, went forth privily into the villages; and gathering together their kinsmen, and those who had remained steadfast in Judaism, they assembled unto six thousand men. **2** And they called upon the Lord, that He would look upon His people, which was trodden down of all, and that He would pity the Temple, **3** which had been defiled by ungodly men; and that He would have mercy upon the perishing city, which was about to be razed even with the ground; **4** and that He would hear the bloods crying unto Him; and that He would also remember the unlawful slaughter of innocent infants; and the blasphemies which were uttered against His Name, and that He would visit all wickedness with His hatred.

**5** Now Maccabaeus, having formed his company, was already become irresistible unto the nations, the wrath of the Lord having been turned into mercy. **6** And coming unexpectedly upon cities and villages, he set them afire, and seizing upon strategic places, **7** he put not a few of the enemies to flight, conquering them. For such assaults he chiefly took the nights as his helpers; and a certain report of his valor was spread abroad everywhere.

**8** But Philip, perceiving the man to be advancing little by little unto prosperity, and to progress more frequently in his successes, wrote unto Ptolemy, the general of Coele-Syria and Phoenicia, that he should come to the aid of the king's affairs. **9** And he, having quickly appointed Nicanor, sent him, even the son of Patroclus, one of the chief friends [of the king], having put under his command nations of sundry sorts, no less than twenty thousand [men], the whole [of the force].
