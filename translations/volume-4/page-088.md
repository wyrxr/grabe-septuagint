μᾶς. Πῶς δυνησόμεθα ὑποστῆναι κατὰ πρόσωπον αὐτῶν, ἐὰν μὴ 53
σὺ βοηθήσῃς ἡμῖν; Καὶ ἐσάλπισαν ταῖς σάλπιγξι, καὶ ἐβόησαν 54
φωνῇ μεγάλῃ. Καὶ μετὰ τοῦτο κατέστησεν Ἰούδας ἡγουμένους 55
τοῦ λαοῦ χιλιάρχους καὶ ἑκατοντάρχους καὶ πεντηκοντάρχους καὶ
δεκαδάρχους. Καὶ εἶπε τοῖς οἰκοδομοῦσιν οἰκίας, καὶ μνηστευομέ- 56
νοις γυναῖκας, καὶ φυτεύουσιν ἀμπελῶνας, καὶ δειλοῖς, ἀποστρέ-
φειν ἕκαστον εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὑτοῦ κατὰ τὸν νόμον. Καὶ ἀπῆρεν 57
ἡ παρεμβολή, καὶ παρενέβαλλοσαν κατὰ νότου Ἀμμαούμ. Καὶ 58
εἶπεν Ἰούδας· περιζώσασθε, καὶ γίνεσθε εἰς υἱοὺς δυνατούς, καὶ
γίνεσθε ἕτοιμοι εἰς τὸ πρωῒ τοῦ πολεμῆσαι ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι τούτοις
τοῖς ἐπισυνηγμένοις ἐφ᾿ ἡμᾶς, ἐξᾶραι ἡμᾶς καὶ τὰ ἅγια ἡμῶν.
Ὅτι κρεῖσσον ἡμᾶς ἀποθανεῖν ἐν πολέμῳ, ἢ ἐπιδεῖν ἐπὶ τὰ κακὰ 59
τοῦ ἔθνους ἡμῶν καὶ τῶν ἁγίων. Ὡς δ᾿ ἂν ᾖ θέλημα ἐν οὐρανῷ, 60
οὕτως ποιήσει.

ΚΕΦ. Δ΄. IV.
ΚΑΙ παρέλαβε Γοργίας πεντακισχιλίους ἄνδρας καὶ χιλίαν 1
ἵππον ἐκλεκτήν, καὶ ἀπῆρεν ἡ παρεμβολὴ νυκτός, ὥστε ἐπιβαλεῖν 2
ἐπὶ τὴν παρεμβολὴν τῶν Ἰουδαίων, καὶ πατάξαι αὐτοὺς ἄφνω,
καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ τῆς ἄκρας ἦσαν αὐτῷ ὁδηγοί. Καὶ ἤκουσεν Ἰούδας, 3
καὶ ἀπῆρεν αὐτὸς καὶ οἱ δυνατοὶ πατάξαι τὴν δύναμιν τοῦ βασι-
λέως τὴν ἐν Ἐμμαούμ, ἕως ἔτι αἱ δυνάμεις ἐσκορπισμέναι ἦσαν 4
ἀπὸ τῆς παρεμβολῆς. Καὶ ἦλθε Γοργίας εἰς τὴν παρεμβολὴν 5
Ἰούδα νυκτός, καὶ οὐδένα εὗρε· καὶ ἐζήτει αὐτοὺς ἐν τοῖς ὄρεσιν,
ὅτι εἶπε, φεύγουσιν οὗτοι ἀφ᾿ ἡμῶν. Καὶ ἅμα ἡμέρᾳ, ὤφθη Ἰού- 6
δας ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ ἐν τρισχιλίοις ἀνδράσι· πλὴν καλύμματα καὶ
μαχαίρας οὐκ εἶχον καθὼς ἠβούλοντο. Καὶ ἰδὼν παρεμβολὴν ἐθνῶν 7
ἰσχυρὰν τεθωρακισμένην, καὶ ἵππον ἐκυκλοῦσαν αὐτήν, καὶ οὗτοι
διδακτοὶ πολέμου. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰούδας τοῖς ἀνδράσι τοῖς μετ᾿ αὑτοῦ· 8
μὴ φοβεῖσθε τὸ πλῆθος αὐτῶν, καὶ τὸ ὄχλημα αὐτῶν μὴ δειλιώθητε.
Μνήσθητε ὡς ἐσώθησαν οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν ἐν θαλάσσῃ ἐρυθρᾷ, ὅτε 9
ἐδίωξεν αὐτοὺς Φαραὼ ἐν δυνάμει. Καὶ νῦν βοήσωμεν εἰς οὐρανόν, 10
εἰ θελήσει ἡμᾶς, καὶ μνησθήσεται διαθήκης πατέρων ἡμῶν, καὶ
συντρίψει τὴν παρεμβολὴν ταύτην κατὰ πρόσωπον ἡμῶν σήμερον.
Καὶ γνώσονται πάντα τὰ ἔθνη, ὅτι ἐστὶν ὁ λυτρούμενος καὶ σῴζων 11
τὸν Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ 12

**58** And Judas said, "Gird yourselves, and be ye valiant men, and be ye ready in the morning to fight against these nations that are gathered against us, to destroy us and our holy places.

**Chapter 4**

**1** And Gorgias took five thousand men, and a thousand chosen horsemen;
**2** and the camp departed by night, that they might fall upon the camp of the Jews, and smite them suddenly; and the sons of the citadel were unto him guides.
**3** And Judas heard [thereof], and he and the valiant men departed to smite the king's host that was in Emmaus,
**4** while yet the forces were dispersed from the camp.
**5** And Gorgias came into the camp of Judas by night, and found no man; and he sought them in the mountains, for he said, "These [men] do flee from us."
**6** And at break of day, Judas was seen in the plain with three thousand men; save that they had not shields and swords according as they would have desired.
**7** And seeing the camp of the nations, strong and mailed [in armor], and cavalry encompassing it, and these [were] men trained for war,
**8** Judas said unto the men that were with him, "Fear ye not their multitude, and be not dismayed by their throng.
**9** Remember how our fathers were saved in the Red Sea, when Pharaoh pursued them with a mighty host.
**10** And now let us cry unto heaven, if He will have us, and will remember the covenant of our fathers, and will dash in pieces this camp before our face this day.
**11** And all the nations shall know that there is One who doth redeem and save Israel."
