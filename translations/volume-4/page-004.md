ΤΩΒΙΤ.

ΚΕΦΑΛΑΙΟΝ Α΄.

ΒΙΒΛΟΣ λόγων Τωβὶτ, τοῦ Τωβιὴλ, τοῦ Ἀνανιὴλ, τοῦ Ἀ- 1
δουλὴ, τοῦ Γαβαὴλ, ἐκ τοῦ σπέρματος Ἀσιὴλ, ἐκ τῆς φυλῆς
Νεφθαλείμ, ὃς ἠχμαλωτεύθη ἐν ἡμέραις Ἐνεμεσσάρου τοῦ βασι- 2
λέως Ἀσσυρίων ἐκ Θίσβης, ἥ ἐστιν ἐκ δεξιῶν κυρίως τῆς Νε-
φθαλείμ ἐν τῇ Γαλιλαίᾳ ὑπεράνω Ἄσηρ. Ἐγὼ Τωβὶτ ὁδοῖς ἀλη-
θείας ἐπορευόμην καὶ δικαιοσύνης πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς ζωῆς
μου. Καὶ ἐλεημοσύνας πολλὰς ἐποίησα τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς μου, καὶ τῷ 3
ἔθνει μου, τοῖς συμπορευομένοις μετ᾽ ἐμοῦ εἰς χώραν Ἀσσυρίων
εἰς Νινευῆ. Καὶ ὅτε ἤμην ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ μου ἐν τῇ γῇ Ἰσραὴλ, 4
νεωτέρου μου ὄντος, πᾶσα φυλὴ τοῦ Νεφθαλείμ τοῦ πατρός μου
ἀπέστη ἀπὸ τοῦ οἴκου Ἱεροσολύμων, τῆς ἐκλεγείσης ἀπὸ πασῶν
τῶν φυλῶν Ἰσραὴλ, εἰς τὸ θυσιάζειν πάσας τὰς φυλὰς· καὶ ἡ-
γιάσθη ὁ ναὸς τῆς κατασκηνώσεως τοῦ ὑψίστου, καὶ ᾠκοδομήθη
εἰς πάσας τὰς γενεὰς τοῦ αἰῶνος. Καὶ πᾶσαι αἱ φυλαὶ αἱ συνα- 5
ποστᾶσαι ἔθυσαν τῷ Βάαλ τῇ δαμάλει, καὶ ὁ οἶκος τοῦ Νεφθα-
λείμ τοῦ πατρός μου. Καὶ ἐγὼ μόνος ἐπορευόμην πλεονάκις εἰς 6
Ἱεροσόλυμα ἐν ταῖς ἑορταῖς, καθώς γέγραπται παντὶ τῷ Ἰσραὴλ
ἐν προστάγματι αἰωνίῳ, τὰς ἀπαρχὰς καὶ τὰς δεκάτας τῶν γε-
νημάτων, καὶ τὰς πρωτοκουρίας ἔχων, καὶ ἐδίδουν αὐτὰ τοῖς 7
ἱερεῦσι τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἀαρὼν πρὸς τὸ θυσιαστήριον· πάντων τῶν
γεννημάτων τὴν δεκάτην ἐδίδουν τοῖς υἱοῖς Λευὶ τοῖς θεραπεύουσιν
εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ, καὶ τὴν δευτέραν δεκάτην ἀπεπρατιζόμην, καὶ
ἐπορευόμην καὶ ἐδαπάνων αὐτὰ ἐν Ἱεροσολύμοις καθ᾽ ἕκαστον
ἐνιαυτὸν, καὶ τὴν τρίτην ἐδίδουν οἷς καθήκει, καθώς ἐνετείλατο 8
Δεββωρὰ ἡ μήτηρ τοῦ πατρός μου, διότι ὀρφανὸς κατελείφθην
ὑπὸ τοῦ πατρός μου. Καὶ ὅτε ἐγενόμην ἀνὴρ, ἔλαβον Ἄνναν 9
γυναῖκα ἐκ τοῦ σπέρματος τῆς πατριᾶς ἡμῶν· καὶ ἐγέννησα ἐξ
αὐτῆς Τωβίαν. Καὶ ὅτε ἠχμαλωτίσθην εἰς Νινευῆ, πάντες οἱ 10
ἀδελφοί μου καὶ οἱ ἐκ τοῦ γένους μου ἤσθιον ἐκ τῶν ἄρτων τῶν

**TOBIT.**

**CHAPTER I.**

1 The Book of the words of Tobit, the son of Tobiel, the son of Ananiel, the son of Aduel, the son of Gabael, of the seed of Asiel, of the tribe of Naphtali;
2 Who was led captive in the days of Enemessar, the king of the Assyrians, from Thisbe, which is situated on the right hand, even truly, of Naphtali in Galilee, above Asher.
3 I, Tobit, did walk in the paths of truth and righteousness all the days of my life. And many alms did I perform for my brethren, and for my nation, even for them that journeyed with me into the land of the Assyrians, unto Nineveh.
4 And when I was in mine own land, even in the land of Israel, and was yet but young, all the tribe of Naphtali, my father's [tribe], did apostatize from the house of Jerusalem, which had been chosen from among all the tribes of Israel, that all the tribes should sacrifice there; and the temple of the tabernacle of the Most High was sanctified, and was built for all generations of the age.
5 And all the tribes that had apostatized together did sacrifice unto Baal, unto the heifer, even the house of Naphtali, my father's [house].
6 And I alone did go up often unto Jerusalem at the feasts, even as it is written for all Israel in an everlasting ordinance, bearing the firstfruits and the tithes of the produce, and the first shearings [of the flock],
7 And I gave them unto the priests, the sons of Aaron, at the altar; of all the produce, the tithe I gave unto the sons of Levi who minister in Jerusalem, and the second tithe I would sell, and I would journey and spend the same in Jerusalem each year, and the third [tithe] I gave unto those to whom it was meet,
8 Even as Deborah, the mother of my father, had commanded [me]; for I was left an orphan by my father.
9 And when I was become a man, I took Anna for my wife from the seed of our kindred; and I begat of her Tobiah.
10 And when I was led captive unto Nineveh, all my brethren and they of my kindred did eat of the bread of the nations,
