**8** ἡ γῆ ἐδίδου τὰ γεννήματα αὐτῆς, καὶ τὰ ξύλα τῶν πεδίων τὸν
**9** καρπὸν αὐτῶν. Πρεσβύτεροι ἐν ταῖς πλατείαις ἐκάθηντο,
    πάντες περὶ ἀγαθῶν ἐκοινολόγουν, καὶ οἱ νεανίσκοι ἐνεδύσαντο
**10** δόξας καὶ στολὰς πολέμου. Ταῖς πόλεσιν ἐχορήγησε βρώματα,
    καὶ ἔταξεν αὐτὰς ἐν σκεύεσιν ὀχυρώσεως, ἕως ὅτου ὠνομάσθη
**11** τὸ ὄνομα τῆς δόξης αὐτοῦ ἕως ἄκρου τῆς γῆς. Ἐποίησε τὴν
    εἰρήνην ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, καὶ ηὐφράνθη Ἰσραὴλ εὐφροσύνην μεγάλην.
**12** Καὶ ἐκάθισεν ἕκαστος ὑπὸ τὴν ἄμπελον αὐτοῦ καὶ τὴν συκῆν αὑτοῦ,
**13** καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ ἐκφοβῶν αὐτούς. Καὶ ἐξέλειπε πολεμῶν αὑτοὺς
    ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, καὶ οἱ βασιλεῖς αὐτῶν συνετρίβησαν ἐν ταῖς
**14** ἡμέραις ἐκείναις. Καὶ ἐστήρισε πάντας τοὺς ταπεινοὺς τοῦ λαοῦ
    αὑτοῦ· τὸν νόμον ἐξεζήτησε, καὶ ἐξῆρε πάντα ἄνομον καὶ πονηρόν.
**15** Τὰ ἅγια ἐδόξασε, καὶ ἐπλήθυνε τὰ σκεύη τῶν ἁγίων.
**16** Καὶ ἠκούσθη ἐν Ῥώμῃ, ὅτι ἀπέθανεν Ἰωναθαν, καὶ ἕως Σπάρτης,
**17** καὶ ἐλυπήθησαν σφόδρα. Ὡς δὲ ἤκουσαν, ὅτι Σίμων ὁ ἀδελφὸς
    αὑτοῦ γέγονεν ἀντ᾿ αὑτοῦ ἀρχιερεύς, καὶ ἐπικρατεῖ τῆς χώρας
**18** καὶ τῶν πόλεων τῶν ἐν αὐτῇ. Καὶ ἔγραψαν πρὸς αὐτὸν
    δέλτοις χαλκαῖς τοῦ ἀνανεώσασθαι πρὸς αὐτὸν φιλίαν καὶ τὴν
    συμμαχίαν, ἣν ἔστησαν πρὸς Ἰούδαν καὶ Ἰωναθαν τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς
**19** αὑτοῦ. Καὶ ἀνεγνώσθησαν ἐνώπιον ἐκκλησίας ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ.
**20** Καὶ τοῦτο τὸ ἀντίγραφον τῶν ἐπιστολῶν ὧν ἀπέστειλαν
    οἱ Σπαρτιᾶται· Σπαρτιατῶν ἄρχοντες καὶ ἡ πόλις Σίμωνι ἱερεῖ
    μεγάλῳ καὶ τοῖς πρεσβυτέροις καὶ τοῖς ἱερεῦσι καὶ τῷ λοιπῷ
**21** δήμῳ τῶν Ἰουδαίων ἀδελφοῖς χαίρειν. Οἱ πρεσβευταὶ οἱ ἀποσταλέντες
    πρὸς τὸν δῆμον ἡμῶν ἀπήγγειλαν ἡμῖν περὶ τῆς δόξης
**22** ὑμῶν καὶ τιμῆς, καὶ ηὐφράνθημεν ἐπὶ τῇ ἐφόδῳ αὐτῶν. Καὶ
    ἀνεγράψαμεν τὰ ὑπ᾿ αὐτῶν εἰρημένα ἐν ταῖς βουλαῖς τοῦ δήμου
    οὕτως· Νουμήνιος Ἀντιόχου καὶ Ἀντίπατρος Ἰάσωνος πρεσβευταὶ
    Ἰουδαίων ἦλθοσαν πρὸς ἡμᾶς ἀνανεούμενοι τὴν πρὸς ἡμᾶς
**23** φιλίαν. Καὶ ἤρεσε τῷ δήμῳ ἐπιδέξασθαι τοὺς ἄνδρας ἐνδόξως,
    καὶ τοῦ θέσθαι τὸ ἀντίγραφον τῶν λόγων αὐτῶν ἐν τοῖς ἀποδεδειγμένοις
    τοῦ δήμου βιβλίοις τοῦ μνημόσυνον ἔχειν τὸν δῆμον
    τῶν Σπαρτιατῶν· τὸ δὲ ἀντίγραφον τούτων ἔγραψαν Σίμωνι τῷ
**24** ἀρχιερεῖ. Μετὰ ταῦτα ἀπέστειλε Σίμων τὸν Νουμήνιον εἰς Ῥώμην
    ἔχοντα ἀσπίδα χρυσῆν μεγάλην ἔλκον χιλίας μνᾶς εἰς τὸ
**25** στῆσαι πρὸς αὐτοὺς τὴν συμμαχίαν. Ὡς δὲ ἤκουσεν ὁ δῆμος

**22** And we have recorded that which was spoken by them in the public records of the people, as follows: Numenius son of Antiochus and Antipater son of Jason, ambassadors of the Jews, came unto us, renewing the friendship with us.
**23** And it pleased the people to receive the men honorably, and to place the copy of their words in the public books of the people, that the people of the Spartans might have a memorial. And a copy of these things they wrote to Simon the High Priest."
