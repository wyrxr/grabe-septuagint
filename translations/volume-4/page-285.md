συνεθίσῃς τὸ στόμα σου· ἔστι γάρ ἐν αὐτῇ λόγος ἁμαρτίας.
Μνήσθητι πατρός σου καί μητρός σου, ἀναμέσον γάρ μεγιστάνων 14
συνεδρεύεις· μήποτε ἐπιλάθῃς ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν, καὶ τῷ ἐθισμῷ σου
μωρανθῇς, καὶ θελήσεις εἰ μή ἐγεννήθης, καὶ τὴν ἡμέραν τοῦ τοκετοῦ 15
σου καταράσῃς. ῎Ανθρωπος συνεθιζόμενος λόγοις ὀνειδισμοῦ, 16
ἐν πάσαις ταῖς ἡμέραις αὐτοῦ οὐ μὴ παιδευθῇ. Δύο εἴδη πληθύνουσιν
ἁμαρτίας. Καὶ τὸ τρίτον ἐπάξει ὀργήν· Ψυχὴ θερμή ὡς
πῦρ καιόμενον, οὐ μὴ σβεσθῇ, ἕως ἂν καταποθῇ· ἄνθρωπος πόρνος
ἐν σώματι σαρκὸς αὐτοῦ, οὐ μὴ παύσηται ἕως ἂν ἐκκαύσῃ
πῦρ· (ἀνθρώπῳ πόρνῳ πᾶς ἄρτος ἡδύς, οὐ μὴ κοπάσῃ ἕως ἂν 17
τελευτήσῃ.) ἄνθρωπος (πόρνος) παραβαίνων ἀπὸ τῆς κοίτης αὐτοῦ, 18
λέγων ἐν τῇ ψυχῇ αὐτοῦ· τίς με ὁρᾷ; σκότος κύκλῳ μου,
καὶ οἱ τοῖχοί με καλύπτουσι, καὶ οὐθεὶς με ὁρᾷ, τίνα εὐλαβοῦμαι;
τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν μου οὐ μὴ μνησθήσεται ὁ Ὕψιστος· καὶ ὀφθαλ- 19
μοὶ ἀνθρώπων ὁ φόβος αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἔγνω ὅτι ὀφθαλμοὶ
Κυρίου μυριπλασίως ἡλίου φωτεινότεροί εἰσιν, ἐπιβλέποντες
πάσας ὁδοὺς ἀνθρώπων, καὶ κατανοοῦντες ἀπόκρυφα μέρη·
(πρίν κτισθῆναι, τὰ πάντα ἔγνωσται αὐτῷ, οὕτως καὶ μετὰ τὸ 20
τελεσθῆναι καθορᾷ τὰ πάντα·) οὗτος ἐν πλατείαις πόλεως ἐκδικη- 21
θήσεται, καὶ οὐ οὐχ ὑπενέγκῃ ἐντραπήσεται. Οὕτως καὶ γυνὴ κα- 22
ταλιποῦσα τὸν ἄνδρα, καὶ παριστῶσα κληρονόμον ἐξ ἀλλοτρίου·
πρῶτον μὲν γάρ ἐν νόμῳ ὑψίστου ἠπείθησε, καὶ δεύτερον εἰς ἄνδρα 23
αὐτῆς ἐπλημμέλησε, καὶ τὸ τρίτον ἐν πορνείᾳ ἐμοιχεύθη, καὶ
ἐξ ἀλλοτρίου ἀνδρὸς τέκνα παρέστησεν αὐτῇ εἰς ἐκκλησίαν ἐξαχθή- 24
σεται, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ τέκνα αὐτῆς ἐπισκοπὴ ἔσται· οὐ διαδώσουσιν 25
τὰ τέκνα αὐτῆς εἰς ῥίζαν, καὶ οἱ κλάδοι αὐτῆς οὐκ οἴσουσι
καρπόν· καταλείψει εἰς κατάραν τὸ μνημόσυνον αὐτῆς, καὶ τὸ 26
ὄνειδος αὐτῆς οὐκ ἐξαλειφθήσεται· καὶ ἐπιγνώσονται οἱ καταληφθέντες 27
ὅτι οὐθὲν κρεῖττον φόβου Κυρίου, καὶ οὐθὲν γλυκύτερον
τοῦ προσέχειν ἐντολαῖς Κυρίου. Δόξα μεγάλη ἀκολουθεῖν 28
Θεῷ, μακρότης δὲ ἡμερῶν τὸ προσληφθῆναί σε ὑπ᾿ αὐτοῦ.

**Chapter Twenty-Three**

13 A shameful lack of instruction, accustom not thy mouth [thereto];
for in it is a word of sin.
14 Remember thy father and thy mother, for among princes dost thou sit in council.
Lest perchance thou forget [thyself] before them, and by thy custom be made foolish;
15 and then shalt thou wish thou hadst not been born, and curse the day of thy nativity.
16 A man accustomed to words of reproach, in all his days shall not be schooled.
Two kinds there are that multiply sins, and the third shall bring forth wrath.
A soul fervent as fire that doth burn, shall not be quenched until it be consumed.
A man that is a fornicator in the body of his flesh, shall not cease until he kindle a fire;
17 (To a man that is a fornicator, every bread is sweet; he shall not cease until he die.)
18 A man (a fornicator) that transgresseth from his bed, saying within his soul,
"Who doth see me? Darkness is round about me, and the walls do cover me,
and no man doth see me. Whom shall I fear?
19 The Most High shall not remember my sins."
And the eyes of men are his fear; and he knew not that the eyes of the Lord
are ten thousand times brighter than the sun, observing all the ways of men,
and discerning [their] secret places.
20 (Before they were created, all things were known unto Him;
so also after they are completed, doth He perceive all things.)
21 This one shall be punished in the broad places of the city,
and he shall not, not endure to be put to shame.
22 Even so a woman, having forsaken her husband, and presenting an heir from a stranger.
23 For first, she hath disobeyed the law of the Most High;
and secondly, against her own husband hath she sinned;
and thirdly, in fornication hath she committed adultery;
and from a strange man hath she presented children.
24 She herself shall be brought forth unto the assembly,
and upon her children there shall be an visitation.
25 Her children shall not spread forth unto the root, and her branches shall not bear fruit.
26 She shall leave her memorial unto a curse, and her reproach shall not be blotted out.
27 And they that are left shall know that nothing is better than the fear of the Lord,
and nothing sweeter than to attend unto the commandments of the Lord.
28 Great glory it is to follow God, and length of days [is] to be received by Him.

**Chapter Twenty-Four**
**The Praise of Wisdom**

1 Wisdom shall praise her own soul, and in the midst of her people shall she boast.
2 In the assembly of the Most High shall she open her mouth, and before
