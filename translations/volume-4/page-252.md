**21.** τὴν σὴν πρὸς τέκνα ἐνεφάνιζε γλυκύτητα· τῇ δὲ τοῦ προσφερομένου ἐπιθυμία ὑπηρετῶν, πρὸς ὅ τι ἐβούλετο μετεκινᾶτο.
**22.** Χιὼν δὲ καὶ χρύσταλλος ὑπέμενε πῦρ καὶ οὐκ ἐτήκετο· ἵνα γνῶσιν, ὅτι τοὺς τῶν ἐχθρῶν καρποὺς κατέφθειρε πῦρ φλεγόμενον ἐν τῇ χαλάζῃ, καὶ ἐν τοῖς δεινοῖς διαστράπτον·
**23.** τοῦτο δὲ πάλιν, ἵνα τραφῶσι δίκαιοι, καὶ τῆς ἰδίας ἐπιλέλησται δυνάμεως.
**24.** Ἡ γὰρ κτίσις σοι τῷ ποιήσαντι ὑπηρετοῦσα, ἐπιτείνεται εἰς κόλασιν κατὰ τῶν ἀδίκων, καὶ ἀνίεται εἰς εὐεργεσίαν ὑπὲρ τῶν ἐπί σοι πεποιθότων.
**25.** Διὰ τοῦτο καὶ τότε εἰς πάντα μεταλλευομένη τῇ παντοτρόφῳ σου δωρεᾷ ὑπηρετεῖ, πρὸς τὴν τῶν δεομένων θέλησιν·
**26.** ἵνα μάθωσιν οἱ υἱοί σου, οὓς ἠγάπησας Κύριε, ὅτι οὐχ αἱ γενέσεις τῶν καρπῶν τρέφουσιν ἄνθρωπον, ἀλλὰ τὸ ῥῆμά σου τοὺς σοι πιστεύοντας διατηρεῖ.
**27.** Τὸ γὰρ ὑπὸ πυρὸς μὴ φθειρόμενον ἁπλῶς ὑπὸ βραχείας ἀκτῖνος ἡλίου θερμαινόμενον ἐτήκετο·
**28.** ὅπως γνωστόν ᾖ, ὅτι δεῖ φθάνειν τὸν ἥλιον ἐπ᾽ εὐχαριστίαν σου, καὶ πρὸς ἀνατολὴν φωτὸς ἐντυγχάνειν σοι.
**29.** Ἀχαρίστου γὰρ ἐλπὶς ὡς χειμερινὴ πάχνη τακήσεται, καὶ ξυήσεται ὡς ὕδωρ ἄχρηστον.

**ΚΕΦ. ΙΖ΄. XVII.**

**1.** ΜΕΓΑΛΑΙ γάρ σου αἱ κρίσεις καὶ δυσδιήγητοι˙ διὰ τοῦτο ἀπαίδευτοι ψυχαὶ ἐπλανήθησαν.
**2.** Ὑπειληρότες γὰρ καταδυναστεύειν ἔθνος ἅγιον ἄνομοι, δέσμιοι σκότους καὶ μακρᾶς πεδῆται νυκτός, κατακλεισθέντες ζόφοις, φυγάδες τῆς αἰωνίου προνοίας ἐκείνετο.
**3.** Λανθάνειν γὰρ νομίζοντες ἐπὶ κρυφαίοις ἁμαρτήμασιν ἀφεγγεῖ λήθης παρακαλύμματι, ἐσκοτίσθησαν θαμβούμενοι δεινῶς, καὶ ἰνδάλμασιν ἐκταρασσόμενοι˙
**4.** οὐδὲ γὰρ ὁ κατέχων αὐτοὺς μυχὸς ἀφόβους διεφύλαττεν, ἤχοι δὲ καταράσσοντες αὐτοὺς, περιεκόμπουν , καὶ φάσματα ἀμειδήτοις κατηφῇ προσώποις ἐνεφανίζετο.
**5.** Καὶ πυρὸς μὲν οὐδεμία βία κατίσχυε φωτίζειν, οὔτε ἄστρων ἔκλαμπροι φλόγες καταυγάζειν ὑπέμενον τὴν στυγνήν ἐκείνην νύκτα˙
**6.** Διεφαίνετο δ᾽ αὐτοῖς μόνον αὐτομάτη πυρὰ φόβου πλήρης· ἐκδειματούμενοί τε τῆς μὴ θεωρουμένης ἐκείνης ὄψεως, ἡγοῦντο χείρω τὰ βλεπόμενα.
**7.** Μαγικῆς δὲ ἐμπαίγματα κατεκείντο τέχνης, καὶ τῆς ἐπὶ φρονήσει ἀλαζονείας ἔλεγχος ἐρόβριστος˙ οἱ γὰρ ὑπισχνούμενοι δείματα καὶ ταραχὰς ἀπε-

**CHAPTER XVI.**

**21** Yet Thy [manna] did manifest Thy sweetness unto Thy children; and serving the desire of him who partook thereof, it was changed according to whatsoever he did desire.
**22** For snow and crystal did endure the fire, and were not melted; that they might know, that the fire burning in the hail, and flashing forth amid the terrors, did destroy the fruits of their enemies;
**23** and that again, that the righteous might be nourished, and [the fire] had forgotten its own power.
**24** For the creation, serving Thee its Maker, doth wax fierce against the unrighteous for punishment, and is relaxed for beneficence on behalf of them who put their trust in Thee.
**25** Wherefore also then, being transformed into all things, it did serve Thy all-nourishing gift, according to the desire of them that had need thereof;
**26** that Thy sons, O Lord, whom Thou didst love, might learn that it is not the generation of fruits which doth nourish man, but Thy word which doth preserve them that believe in Thee.
**27** For that which was not destroyed by fire was simply melted by a brief ray of the sun, when it was heated;
**28** that it might be known that it is needful to anticipate the sun with thanksgiving unto Thee, and to supplicate Thee at the dawning of the light.
**29** For the hope of the ungrateful shall melt away like the hoarfrost of winter, and shall be wiped away like useless water.

**CHAPTER XVII.**

**1** For great are Thy judgments, O Lord, and hard to be uttered; therefore uninstructed souls have gone astray.
**2** For when the lawless did suppose to oppress a holy nation, they, being prisoners of darkness and fettered ones of a long night, were confined in gloomy depths, and as fugitives from eternal providence, were rendered vain.
**3** For supposing to hide their secret sins beneath a lightless veil of forgetfulness, they were darkened, being terribly dismayed, and disquieted by phantoms;
**4** for neither did the inner recess which did hold them keep them fearless; but crashing sounds did resound around them, and phantoms with unsmiling, downcast faces did appear unto them.
**5** And no force of fire could give light, neither did the brilliant flames of the stars endure to illumine that dreadful night;
**6** but there appeared unto them only a fire self-kindled, full of dread; and being terrified by that unseen sight, they did account the things which were seen to be yet worse.
**7** And there did lie the delusions of magical art, and a resounding conviction of the arrogance built upon [their own] wisdom; for those who did promise to drive away terrors and disturbances...
