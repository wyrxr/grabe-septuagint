ΚΕΦ. Δ΄. Ε΄. ΙΗΣΟΥ ΥΙΟΥ ΣΙΡΑΧ 1793
νομήσει αὐτήν, καὶ ἐν κατασχέσει ἔσονται αἱ γενεαὶ αὐτοῦ. Ὅτι 17
διεστραμμένως πορεύσεται μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ ἐν πρώτοις, φόβον καὶ δει-
λίαν ἐπάξει ἐπ᾽ αὐτόν, καὶ βασανίσει αὐτὸν ἐν παιδείᾳ αὐτῆς·
ἕως οὗ ἐμπιστεύσῃ τῇ ψυχῇ αὐτοῦ, καὶ πειράσῃ αὐτὸν ἐν τοῖς
δικαιώμασιν αὐτῆς· καὶ πάλιν ἐπανάξει κατ᾽ εὐθεῖαν πρὸς αὐ- 18
τόν, καὶ εὐφρανεῖ αὐτόν, καὶ ἀποκαλύψει αὐτῷ τὰ κρυπτὰ αὐ-
τῆς. Ἐὰν ἀποπλανηθῇ, ἐγκαταλείψει αὐτόν, καὶ παραδώσει αὐ- 19
τὸν εἰς χεῖρας πτώσεως αὐτοῦ. Συντήρησον καιρὸν καὶ φύλαξαι 20
ἀπὸ πονηροῦ, καὶ περὶ τῆς ψυχῆς σου μὴ αἰσχυνθῇς· ἔστι γὰρ 21
αἰσχύνη ἐπάγουσα ἁμαρτίαν, καὶ ἔστιν αἰσχύνη δόξα καὶ χάρις.
Μὴ λάβῃς πρόσωπον κατὰ τῆς ψυχῆς σου, καὶ μὴ ἐντραπῇς εἰς 22
πτῶσίν σου. Μὴ κωλύσῃς λόγον ἐν καιρῷ σωτηρίας, καὶ μὴ 23
κρύψῃς τὴν σοφίαν σου εἰς καλλονήν. Ἐν γὰρ λόγῳ γνωσθήσε- 24
ται σοφία, καὶ παιδεία ἐν ῥήματι γλώσσης. Μὴ ἀντίλεγε τῇ 25
ἀληθείᾳ κατὰ μηδὲ ἕν, καὶ περὶ ψεύσματος τῆς ἀπαιδευσίας σου
ἐντράπηθι· μὴ αἰσχυνθῇς ὁμολογῆσαι ἐφ᾽ ἁμαρτίαις σου, καὶ μὴ 26
βιάζου ῥοῦν ποταμοῦ. Καὶ μὴ ὑποστρώσῃς ἀνθρώπῳ μωρῷ σε- 27
αυτόν, καὶ μὴ λάβῃς πρόσωπον δυνάστου. Ἕως θανάτου ἀγώνισαι 28
περὶ τῆς ἀληθείας, καὶ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς πολεμήσει ὑπὲρ σοῦ. Μὴ 29
γίνου ταχὺς ἐν γλώσσῃ σου, καὶ νωθρὸς καὶ παρειμένος ἐν τοῖς
ἔργοις σου. Μὴ ἴσθι ὡς λέων ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ σου, καὶ φαντασιοκο- 30
πῶν ἐν τοῖς ἱκέταις σου. Μὴ ἔστω ἡ χείρ σου ἐκτεταμένη εἰς 31
τὸ λαβεῖν καὶ ἐν τῷ ἀποδιδόναι συνεσταλμένη.

ΚΕΦ. Ε΄. V.

Μὴ ἔπεχε ἐπὶ τοῖς χρήμασί σου, καὶ μὴ εἴπῃς· αὐτάρκη 1
μοι ἐστὶν εἰς ζωήν. Μὴ ἐξακολούθει τῇ ψυχῇ σου καὶ τῇ ἰσχύϊ 2
σου, τοῦ πορεύεσθαι ἐν ἐδοῖς καρδίας σου. Καὶ μὴ εἴπῃς· τίς με 3
δυναστεύσει διὰ τὰ ἔργα μου; ὁ γὰρ Κύριος ἐκδικῶν ἐκδικήσει
σου τὴν ὕβριν. Μὴ εἴπῃς· ἥμαρτον, καὶ τί μοι ἐγένετο λυπηρόν; 4
ὁ γὰρ Κύριός ἐστι μακρόθυμος, οὐ μή σε ἀνῇ. Περὶ ἐξιλασμοῦ μὴ 5
ἄφοβος γίνου, προσθεῖναι ἁμαρτίαν ἐφ᾽ ἁμαρτίαις· καὶ μὴ εἴπῃς· 6
ὁ οἰκτιρμὸς αὐτοῦ πολύς, τὸ πλῆθος τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν μου ἐξιλάσε-
ται· ἔλεος γὰρ καὶ ὀργὴ παρ᾽ αὐτῷ, καὶ ἐπὶ ἁμαρτωλοὺς κατα-
παύσει ὁ θυμὸς αὐτοῦ. Μὴ ἀνάμενε ἐπιστρέψαι πρὸς Κύριον, καὶ 7

**Chapter Four**

17 [If thou trust in her], thou shalt inherit her, and his generations shall be in her possession. For at first she will walk with him in crooked paths, and fear and dread will she bring upon him, and she will torment him by her discipline, until he trust with his soul, and she test him by her ordinances.
18 And again will she lead him forth by a straight path unto him, and she will gladden him, and will reveal unto him her hidden things.
19 But if he go astray, she will forsake him, and will deliver him into the hands of his ruin.
20 Observe the opportune moment and guard thyself from the wicked, and concerning thy soul be not ashamed.
21 For there is a shame that bringeth sin, and there is a shame that is glory and grace.
22 Show no partiality against thine own soul, and be not abashed unto thy downfall.
23 Hinder not a word in the time of deliverance, and hide not thy wisdom as an adornment.
24 For by speech shall wisdom be known, and instruction by the utterance of the tongue.
25 Contradict not the truth in any wise, and be ashamed of the falsehood of thine ignorance.
26 Be not ashamed to confess thy sins, and strive not against the current of a river.
27 And yield not thyself unto a foolish man, neither show partiality to a powerful one.
28 Strive for the truth even unto death, and the Lord God shall fight for thee.
29 Be not swift in thy tongue, and sluggish and negligent in thy works.
30 Be not as a lion in thy house, and playing the tyrant among thy suppliants.
31 Let not thy hand be stretched out to receive, and contracted when it is time to give.

**Chapter Five**

1 Set not thy heart upon thy riches, and say not, "They are sufficient for me for life."
2 Follow not after thine own soul and thy strength, to walk in the desires of thy heart.
3 And say not, "Who shall have power over me because of my works?" For the Lord, avenging, shall surely avenge thine insolence.
4 Say not, "I have sinned, and what harm hath befallen me?" For the Lord is long-suffering; He will by no means let thee go unpunished.
5 Be not without fear concerning propitiation, [lest thou] add sin upon sins.
6 And say not, "His compassions are many; the multitude of my sins shall be atoned for." For mercy and wrath are with Him, and upon sinners shall His indignation descend.
7 Wait not to turn back unto the Lord, and...
