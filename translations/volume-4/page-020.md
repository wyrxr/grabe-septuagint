ὅτι πέπεισμαι ὅσα ἐλάλησεν Ἰωνᾶς ὁ προφήτης περὶ Νινευῆ,
ὅτι κατασκαφήσεται· ἐν δὲ τῇ Μηδίᾳ ἔσται εἰρήνη μᾶλλον ἕως
καιροῦ· καὶ ὅτι οἱ ἀδελφοὶ ἡμῶν ἐν τῇ γῇ σκορπισθήσονται ἀπὸ
τῆς ἀγαθῆς γῆς· καὶ Ἱεροσόλυμα ἔσται ἔρημος, καὶ ὁ οἶκος τοῦ
Θεοῦ ἐν αὐτῇ κατακαήσεται, καὶ ἔρημος ἔσται μέχρι χρόνου. Καὶ 5
πάλιν ἐλεήσει αὐτοὺς ὁ Θεός, καὶ ἐπιστρέψει αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν γῆν,
καὶ οἰκοδομήσουσι τὸν οἶκον, οὐχ οἷος ὁ πρότερος, ἕως πληρω-
θῶσι καιροὶ τοῦ αἰῶνος. καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα ἐπιστρέψουσιν ἐκ τῶν
αἰχμαλωσιῶν, καὶ οἰκοδομήσουσιν Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐντίμως· καὶ ὁ οἶ-
κος τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐν αὐτῇ οἰκοδομηθήσεται εἰς πάσας τὰς γενεὰς τοῦ
αἰῶνος οἰκοδομὴ ἐνδόξῳ, καθὼς ἐλάλησαν περὶ αὐτῆς οἱ προφῆ-
ται. Καὶ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη ἐπιστρέψουσιν ἀληθινῶς φοβεῖσθαι Κύ- 6
ριον τὸν Θεόν, καὶ κατεροῦσι τὰ εἴδωλα αὐτῶν, καὶ εὐλογήσου- 7
σι πάντα τὰ ἔθνη τὸν Κύριον· καὶ ὁ λαὸς αὐτοῦ ἐξομολογήσεται
τῷ Θεῷ· καὶ ὑψώσει Κύριος τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ χαρήσονται
πάντες οἱ ἀγαπῶντες Κύριον τὸν Θεὸν ἐν ἀληθείᾳ καὶ δικαιοσύ-
νῃ, ποιοῦντες ἔλεος τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς ἡμῶν. Καὶ νῦν, τέκνον, ἄπελθε 8
ἀπὸ Νινευῆ, ὅτι πάντως ἔσται ἃ ἐλάλησεν ὁ προφήτης Ἰωνᾶς.
Σὺ δὲ τήρησον τὸν νόμον καὶ τὰ προστάγματα, καὶ γίνου φιλε- 9
λήμων καὶ δίκαιος, ἵνα σοι καλῶς ᾖ. Καὶ θάψον με καλῶς, καὶ 10
τὴν μητέρα σου μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ, καὶ μηκέτι αὐλισθῆτε ἐν Νινευῇ, τέ-
κνον, ἴδε τί ἐποίησεν Ἀμὰν Ἀχιαχάρῳ τῷ θρέψαντι αὐτόν, ὡς
ἐκ τοῦ φωτὸς ἤγαγεν αὐτὸν εἰς σκότος, καὶ ὅσα ἀνταπέδωκεν
αὐτῷ. καὶ Ἀχιάχαρος μὲν ἐσώθη, ἐκεῖνος δὲ τὸ ἀνταπόδομα ἀπέδωκεν, καὶ αὐτὸς κατέβη εἰς τὸ σκότος. Μανασσῆς ἐποίησεν ἐλεη-
μοσύνην, καὶ ἐσώθη ἐκ παγίδος θανάτου ἧς ἔπηξεν αὐτῷ. Ἀμὰν
δὲ ἐνέπεσεν εἰς τὴν παγίδα, καὶ ἀπώλετο. Καὶ νῦν, παιδία, ἴδετε 11
τί ἐλεημοσύνη ποιεῖ, καὶ τί δικαιοσύνη ῥύεται· καὶ ταῦτα αὐτοῦ
λέγοντος, ἐξέλειπεν αὐτοῦ ἡ ψυχὴ ἐπὶ τῆς κλίνης· ἦν δὲ ἐτῶν ἑ-
κατὸν πεντηκονταοκτώ· καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν ἐνδόξως. Καὶ ὅτε ἀπέ- 12
θανεν Ἄννα, ἔθαψεν αὐτὴν μετὰ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ· ἀπῆλθε δὲ
Τωβίας μετὰ τῆς γυναικὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ εἰς Ἑκ-
βάτανα πρὸς Ῥαγουήλ τὸν πενθερὸν αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐγήρασεν ἐντί- 13
μως, καὶ ἔθαψε τοὺς πενθεροὺς αὐτοῦ ἐνδόξως, καὶ ἐκληρονόμησε
τὴν οὐσίαν αὐτῶν, καὶ Τωβὶτ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἀπέθανεν ἐ- 14
τῶν ἑκατὸν εικοσιεπτὰ ἐν Ἐκβατάνοις τῆς Μηδίας. Καὶ ἤκουσε 15
πρινὴ ἀποθανεῖν αὐτὸν, τὴν ἀπώλειαν Νινευὴ, ἣν ἠχμαλώτευσε
Ναβουχοδονόσορ, καὶ Ἀσσύρης· καὶ ἐχάρη πρὸ τοῦ ἀποθανεῖν ἐπὶ
Νινευή.

### CHAPTER 14

[Tobit 14:4 cont.]
for I am persuaded concerning all things which Jonah the prophet spake of Nineveh, that it shall be utterly overthrown; but in Media there shall be peace rather for a season. And know thou that our brethren shall be scattered from the good land; and Jerusalem shall be desolate, and the house of God in her shall be burned, and it shall be desolate for a season.

[Tobit 14:5]
And again God shall have mercy upon them, and shall bring them back unto the land; and they shall build the house, not such as the former, until the times of the age be fulfilled. And after these things they shall return from their captivities, and shall build Jerusalem honorably; and the house of God in her shall be built for all generations of the age, a building glorious, even as the prophets spake concerning her.

[Tobit 14:6]
And all the nations shall truly turn to fear the Lord God,

[Tobit 14:7]
and they shall cast down their idols, and all the nations shall bless the Lord. And His people shall give thanks unto God; and the Lord shall exalt His people, and all they that love the Lord God in truth and righteousness, doing mercy unto our brethren, shall rejoice.

[Tobit 14:8]
And now, my child, depart from Nineveh, for assuredly shall that which Jonah the prophet spake come to pass.

[Tobit 14:9]
But thou, keep the Law and the commandments, and be merciful and righteous, that it may be well with thee.

[Tobit 14:10]
And bury me well, and thy mother with me; and abide no longer in Nineveh, my child. Behold, what Aman did unto Achiacharus, him that nourished him, how he brought him out of light into darkness, and how much he repaid him. And Achiacharus indeed was saved, but he [Aman] rendered the requital, and himself went down into darkness. Manasseh did alms, and was saved from the snare of death which he [Aman] had laid for him; but Aman fell into the snare, and perished.

[Tobit 14:11]
And now, my children, see ye what alms doth, and what righteousness delivereth. And as he spake these things, his soul departed from him upon the bed; and he was an hundred fifty and eight years old; and they buried him gloriously.

[Tobit 14:12]
And when Anna died, he buried her with his father. And Tobias went forth with his wife and his sons into Ecbatana unto Raguel his father-in-law.

[Tobit 14:13]
And he waxed old honorably, and buried his parents-in-law gloriously, and inherited their substance, and that of Tobit his father.

[Tobit 14:14]
And he died, being an hundred twenty and seven years old, in Ecbatana of Media.

[Tobit 14:15]
And he heard, before he died, of the destruction of Nineveh, which Nebuchadnezzar, and [the king] of Assyria, took captive; and he rejoiced before he died over Nineveh.
