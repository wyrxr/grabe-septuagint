    αἰσχυντηρὸς ἀληθινῶς, καὶ εὑρίσκων χάριν ἔναντι παντὸς ἀνθρώπου.

**ΚΕΦ. ΜΒ΄. XLII.**

1 Μὴ περὶ τούτων αἰσχυνθῇς, καὶ μὴ λάβῃς πρόσωπον τοῦ
2 ἁμαρτάνειν· περὶ νόμου ὑψίστου καὶ διαθήκης, καὶ περὶ κρίματος
3 δικαιῶσαι τὸν ἀσεβῆ, περὶ λόγου κοινοῦ καὶ ὁδοιπόρων, περὶ δό-
4 σεως κληρονομίας ἑταίρων, περὶ ἀκριβείας ζυγοῦ καὶ σταθμῶν, καὶ
5 περὶ κτήσεως πολλῶν καὶ ὀλίγων, περὶ ἀδιαφόρου πράσεως ἐμ-
   πόρων, καὶ περὶ παιδείας τέκνων πολλῆς, καὶ οἰκέτῃ πονηρῷ
6 πλευρὰν αἱμάξαι· ἐπὶ γυναικὶ πονηρᾷ καλὸν σφραγίς, καὶ ὅπου
7 χεῖρες πολλαί, κλεῖσον· ὃ ἐὰν παραδίδως, ἐν ἀριθμῷ καὶ σταθμῷ,
8 καὶ δόσις καὶ λῆψις πάντα ἐν γραφῇ· περὶ παιδείας ἀνοήτου καὶ
9 μωροῦ καὶ ἐσχατογήρου κρινομένου πρὸς νέους, καὶ ἔσῃ πεπαιδευ-
   μένος ἀληθινῶς, καὶ δεδοκιμασμένος ἔναντι παντὸς ζῶντος. Θυ-
   γάτηρ πατρὶ ἀπόκρυφος ἀγρυπνία, καὶ ἡ μέριμνα αὐτῆς ἀφιστᾷ
   ὕπνον· ἐν νεότητι αὐτῆς μήποτε παρακμάσῃ, καὶ συνῳκηκυῖα μή-
10 ποτε μισηθῇ· ἐν παρθενίᾳ μήποτε βεβηλωθῇ, καὶ ἐν τοῖς πα-
   τρικοῖς αὐτῆς ἔγκυος γένηται· μετὰ ἀνδρὸς οὖσα μήποτε παρα-
11 βῇ, καὶ συνῳκηκυῖα μήποτε στειρωθῇ. Ἐπὶ θυγατρὶ ἀδιατρέπτῳ
   στερέωσον φυλακήν, μήποτε ποιήσῃ σε ἐπίχαρμα ἐχθροῖς, λα-
   λιὰν ἐν πόλει, καὶ ἔγκλητον λαοῦ, καὶ καταισχύνη σε ἐν πλήθει
12 πολλῶν. Παντὶ ἀνθρώπῳ μὴ ἔμβλεπε ἐν κάλλει, καὶ ἐν μέσῳ γυ-
13 ναικῶν μὴ συνέδρευε· ἀπὸ γὰρ ἱματίων ἐκπορεύεται σής, καὶ ἀπὸ
14 γυναικὸς πονηρία (γυναικός). Κρείσσων πονηρία ἀνδρὸς ἢ ἀγαθο-
15 ποιὸς γυνή, καὶ γυνὴ καταισχύνουσα εἰς ὀνειδισμόν. Μνησθήσομαι
   δὴ τὰ ἔργα Κυρίου, καὶ ἃ ἑώρακα ἐκδιηγήσομαι· ἐν λόγοις Κυρίου
16 τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ. Ἥλιος φωτίζων κατὰ πᾶν ἐπέβλεψε, καὶ τῆς
17 δόξης Κυρίου πλήρες τὸ ἔργον αὐτοῦ. Οὐκ ἐνεποίησε τοῖς ἁ-
   γίοις Κύριος ἐκδιηγήσασθαι πάντα τὰ θαυμάσια αὐτοῦ, ἃ ἐστε-
   ρέωσε Κύριος ὁ παντοκράτωρ, στηριχθῆναι ἐν δόξῃ αὐτοῦ τὸ
18 πᾶν. Ἄβυσσον καὶ καρδίαν ἐξίχνευσε, καὶ ἐν πανουργήμασιν αὐ-
   τῶν διενοήθη· ἔγνω γὰρ ὁ ὕψιστος πᾶσαν εἴδησιν, καὶ ἐνέβλεψεν
19 εἰς σημεῖον αἰῶνος. Ἀπαγγέλλων τὰ παρεληλυθότα καὶ τὰ ἐ-
20 σόμενα, καὶ ἀποκαλύπτων ἴχνη ἀποκρύφων· οὐ παρῆλθεν αὐτὸν

**Chapter Forty-Two**

24 (And) of a word heard, and from the revealing of secret words;
So shalt thou be truly modest, and find favor before every man.

1 Be not thou ashamed concerning these things,
nor accept any person so as to sin [thereby]:
2 Concerning the law of the Most High and the covenant;
And concerning a judgment to justify the ungodly;
3 Concerning a common matter and of sojourners;
Concerning the giving of an inheritance to companions;
4 Concerning the accuracy of the balance and of weights;
And concerning the acquisition of much and of little;
5 Concerning the impartial selling of merchants;
And concerning much discipline for children;
And to make a wicked servant's side to bleed;
6 Upon a wicked woman, a good seal [is needed];
And where [there be] many hands, close [it] up.
7 Whatever thou dost hand over, let it be in number and in weight;
8 And let all giving and receiving be in writing.
Be not ashamed concerning the instruction of the foolish and the stupid,
9 And of the utterly aged man being judged against young men.
And so shalt thou be truly instructed, and approved before every living person.

(A daughter is to a father a hidden sleeplessness,
And her care keepeth away sleep:
In her youth, lest she should fade;
And having been married, lest she should be hated;
10 In her virginity, lest she should be defiled;
And in her father's house, lest she should become pregnant;
Being with a husband, lest she should transgress;
11 And having been married, lest she should become barren.)

Over a daughter [who is as yet] incorruptible, establish a guard;
Lest she make thee a cause for rejoicing unto enemies,
A gossip in the city, and a reproach of the people,
And disgrace thee in the multitude of many.
12 Look not intently upon every person for [their] beauty,
And sit not in the midst of women.
13 For from garments cometh forth a moth,
And from a woman, wickedness (of a woman).
14 Better is the wickedness of a man than a well-doing woman,
15 And a woman that bringeth shame unto reproach.

Indeed, I will remember the works of the Lord,
And what I have seen, I will recount;
By the words of the Lord are His works.
16 The sun, shining, hath looked upon all things,
17 And full of the glory of the Lord is His work.
The Lord hath not enabled His saints to recount all His wondrous works,
Which the Lord Almighty hath established,
That the whole [universe] might be established in His glory.
18 The abyss and the heart hath He traced out;
And in their crafty devices, He hath considered.
For the Most High knew all knowledge,
And He looked into the sign of eternity.
19 Declaring the things that have passed and the things that are to come,
20 And revealing the traces of hidden things;
Nothing hath passed Him by,
