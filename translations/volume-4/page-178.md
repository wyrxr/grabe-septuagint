καὶ συνιδόντες ἔργα σῆς χειρός, ἤνεσάν σε τὸν παντοκράτορα.
9 Σὺ βασιλεῦ, κτίσας τὴν ἀπέρατον καὶ ἀμέτρητον γῆν, ἐξελέξω τὴν πόλιν ταύτην, καὶ ἡγίασας τὸν τόπον τοῦτον εἰς (σὸν) ὄνομά σοι τῶι τῶν ἁπάντων ἀπροσδεεῖ, καὶ παρεδόξασας ἐν ἐπιφανείᾳ μεγαλοπρεπεῖ, σύστασιν ποιησάμενος αὐτοῦ πρὸς δόξαν τοῦ μεγάλου καὶ ἐντίμου ὀνόματός σου.
10 Καὶ ἀγαπῶν τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, ἐπηγγείλω δὴ, ὅτι ἐὰν γένηται ἡμῖν ἀποστροφή, καὶ καταλάβῃ ἡμᾶς στενοχωρία, καὶ ἐλθόντες εἰς τὸν τόπον τοῦτον δεηθῶμεν, εἰσακούσῃ τῆς δεήσεως ἡμῶν.
11 Καὶ δὴ πιστὸς εἶ καὶ ἀληθινός.
12 Ἐπεὶ δὲ πλεονάκις (καὶ) θλιβέντων τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν, ἐβοήθησας αὐτοῖς ἐν τῇ ταπεινώσει, καὶ ἐξήρωςας αὐτοὺς ἐκ μεγάλων κινδύνων.
13 Ἰδοὺ δὴ νῦν, ἅγιε βασιλεῦ, διὰ τὰς πολλὰς καὶ μεγάλας ἡμῶν ἁμαρτίας καταπονοῦμεθα, καὶ ὑπετάγημεν ἐχθροῖς ἡμῶν, καὶ παρείμεθα ἐν ἀδυναμίᾳ.
14 Ἐν δὲ τῇ ἡμετέρᾳ καταπτώσει ὁ βραχὺς καὶ βέβηλος οὗτος ἐπιτηδεύει καθυβρίσαι τὸν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς ἀναδειγμένον τῷ ὀνόματι τῆς δόξης σου ἅγιον τόπον.
15 Τὸ μὲν γὰρ κατοικητήριον τοῦ οὐρανοῦ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ἀνέφικτος ἀνθρώποις ἐστίν.
16 Ἀλλὰ ἐπεὶ εὐδόκησας τὴν δόξαν σου ἐν τῷ λαῷ σου Ἰσραήλ, ἡγίασας τὸν τόπον τοῦτον.
17 Μὴ ἐκδικήσῃς ἡμᾶς ἐν τῇ τούτων ἀκαθαρσίᾳ, μηδὲ εὐθύνῃς ἡμᾶς ἐν βεβηλώσει, ἵνα μὴ καυχήσωνται οἱ παράνομοι ἐν θυμῷ αὐτῶν, μηδὲ ἀγαλλιάσωνται ἐν ὑπερηφανίᾳ γλώσσης αὐτῶν, λέγοντες· ἡμεῖς κατεπατήσαμεν τὸν οἶκον τοῦ ἁγιασμοῦ, ὡς καταπατοῦνται οἱ 18 οἶκοι τῶν προσχθισμάτων.
19 Ἀπάλειψον τὰς ἁμαρτίας ἡμῶν, καὶ διασκέδασον τὰς ἀμπλακίας ἡμῶν, καὶ ἐπίφανον τὸ ἔλεός σου κατὰ τὴν ὥραν ταύτην.
20 Ταχὺ προκαταλαβέτωσαν ἡμᾶς οἱ οἰκτιρμοί σου καὶ δὸς ἀνέσεις ἐν τῷ στόματι τῶν καταπεπτωκότων καὶ συντετριμμένων τὰς ψυχάς, ποιήσας ἡμῖν εἰρήνην.
21 Ἐνταῦθα ὁ πάντων ἐπόπτης Θεὸς καὶ πρὸ πάντων ἅγιος ἐν ἁγίοις εἰσακούσας τῆς ἐνθέσμου λιτανείας, τὸν ὕβρει καὶ θράσει μεγάλως ἐπηρμένον ἐμάστιξεν αὐτὸν, ἔνθεν καὶ ἔνθεν κραδάνας αὐτὸν 22 ὡς κάλαμον ὑπὸ ἀνέμου, ὥστε κατ᾽ ἐδάφους ἄπρακτον ἔτι, καὶ τοῖς μέλεσι παραλελυμένον, μηδὲ φωνῆσαι δύνασθαι δικαίᾳ περιπεπληγμένον κρίσει.
23 Ὅθεν οἵ τε φίλοι καὶ σωματοφύλακες αὐτοῦ ταχεῖαν καὶ ὀξεῖαν ἰδόντες τὴν καταλαβουσαν αὐτὸν εὐθύναν, φοβούμενοι μὴ καὶ τὸ ζῇν ἐκλείπῃ, ταχέως αὐτὸν ἐξείλκυ-

**Chapter 2**

**8** who also, having seen the works of Thy hand, did praise Thee, the Almighty.

**9** Thou, O King, having created the boundless and immeasurable earth, didst choose this city and didst sanctify this place unto Thine [own] Name, even unto Thee, who art in need of nothing of all things; and Thou didst glorify it in a magnificent manifestation, having made its establishment for the glory of Thy great and honorable Name.

**10** And loving the house of Israel, Thou didst indeed promise that if a turning back should come to pass for us, and distress should overtake us, and having come into this place, we should make supplication, Thou wouldst hear our supplication.

**11** And verily, Thou art faithful and true.

**12** But since oftentimes, [even] when our fathers were afflicted, Thou didst help them in their lowliness and didst deliver them from great dangers;

**13** behold now, O Holy King, because of our many and great sins, we are sore distressed and have been subjected to our enemies, and we are weakened in infirmity.

**14** And in our downfall, this short-sighted and profane [man] doth intend to outrage the holy place set apart on earth for the Name of Thy glory.

**15** For indeed, the dwelling-place of the Heaven of Heavens is unattainable by men.

**16** But since Thou wast pleased to set Thy glory among Thy people Israel, Thou didst sanctify this place.

**17** Punish us not with their uncleanness, neither chasten us with their profanation, lest the lawless ones boast in their wrath, nor rejoice in the arrogance of their tongue, saying, "We have trodden down the house of sanctification, as the houses of abominations are trodden down."

**19** Blot out our sins, and scatter our transgressions, and manifest Thy mercy at this hour.

**20** Let Thy compassions quickly overtake us, and give relief unto the mouth of those who are fallen and whose souls are crushed, making peace for us.

**21** Hereupon, God, the Overseer of all, and before all things, Holy of Holies, having heard the righteous supplication, did scourge him who was greatly puffed up with insolence and audacity, shaking him to and fro, **22** as a reed in the wind; so that he lay upon the ground, still helpless, and paralyzed in his limbs, not even able to speak, being smitten by a righteous judgment.

**23** Wherefore both his friends and his bodyguards, having seen the swift and sharp chastisement that had overtaken him, and fearing lest even his life should fail, quickly dragged him out—
