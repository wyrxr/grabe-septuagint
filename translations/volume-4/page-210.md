Καλοκαγαθία καθωπλισμένος τεθνήξομαι μὲν κἀγὼ μετὰ τῶν 22
ἀδελφῶν μου. Σὺ δὲ, ὦ τύραννε, μέγαν σοι προσλαβεῖν καὶ αὐ- 23
τὸς τιμωρὸν, καινουργὲ τῶν βασάνων, καὶ πολέμιε τῶν ἀληθῶς
εὐσεβούντων. Ὡς μειράκιον κατελύσαμεν σου τὴν τυραννίδα. 24
Τὸ γὰρ μὴ δυνηθῆναί σε μεταπεῖσαι τὸν λογισμὸν ἡμῶν, μήτε 25
βιάσασθαι πρὸς τὴν μιαροφαγίαν, οὐ κατάλυσίς ἐστιν σοῦ; Τὸ 26
πῦρ σου ψυχρὸν ἡμῖν, καὶ ἄπονοι οἱ καταπέλται, καὶ ἀδύνατος
ἡ βία σου. Οὐ γὰρ τυράννου, ἀλλὰ θείου νόμου προεστήκασιν 27
ἡμῶν οἱ δορυφόροι· διὰ τοῦτο ἀνίκητον ἔχομεν τὸν λογισμόν.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΒ΄. ΧΙΙ.
Ὡς δὲ καὶ οὗτος μακαρίως ἐναπέθανεν καταβληθεὶς εἰς λέ- 1
βητα, ὁ ἕβδομος παρεγίνετο, πάντων νεώτερος. Ὅν κατοικτειρή- 2
σας ὁ τύραννος, καίπερ δεινῶς ὑπὸ τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτοῦ καταικισθεὶς,
ὁρῶν ἤδη τὰ δεσμὰ περικείμενον, πλησιέστερον αὐτὸν μετεπέμψατο, 3
καὶ παρηγορεῖν ἐπειρᾶτο, λέγων· Τῆς μὲν τῶν ἀδελφῶν σου ἀπο- 4
νοίας τὸ τέλος ὁρᾷς· διὰ γὰρ ἀπείθειαν στρεβλωθέντες τεθνήκασιν,
σὺ δὲ, εἰ μὲν μὴ πεισθείης, τάλας βασανισθεὶς καὶ αὐτὸς τεθνήξῃ
πρὸ ὥρας. Πεισθεὶς δὲ φίλος ἔσῃ, καὶ τῶν ἐπὶ τῆς βασιλείας ἀρ- 5
γήσῃ πραγμάτων. Καὶ ταῦτα παρακαλῶν, τὴν μητέρα τοῦ παιδὸς 6
μετεπέμψατο, ὅπως αὐτὴν ἐλεήσας τοσούτων υἱῶν στερηθεῖσαν πα-
ρορμήσειεν ἐπὶ τὴν σωτηρίαν, εὐπειθῆ ποιῆσαι τὸν περιλειπόμενον.
Ὁ δὲ τῆς μητρὸς τῇ Ἑβραίδι φωνῇ προτρεψαμένης αὐτὸν (ὡς ἐροῦ- 7
μεν μετὰ μικρὸν ὕστερον,) ἀπολύσατέ με, φησίν· εἴπω τι τῷ βα- 8
σιλεῖ καὶ τοῖς σὺν αὐτῷ φίλοις πάντη. Καὶ ἐπιχαρέντες ὅ τε βα- 9
σιλεὺς καὶ οἱ σὺν αὐτῷ μάλιστα ἐπὶ τῇ ἐπαγγελίᾳ τοῦ παιδὸς,
ταχέως ἔλυσαν αὐτόν. Καὶ δραμὼν ἐπὶ πλησίον τῶν τηγάνων, ἔφη· 10
Ἀνόσιε, φησὶν, καὶ πάντων τῶν πονηρῶν ἀσεβέστατε τύραννε, οὐκ 11
ἠδέθης παρὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ λαβὼν τὰ ἀγαθὰ καὶ τὴν βασιλείαν, καὶ τοὺς
θεράποντας αὐτοῦ κατακτεῖναι, καὶ τοὺς τῆς εὐσεβείας ἀσκητὰς
στρεβλῶσαι; Ἀνθ’ ὧν ταμιεύεται σε ἡ θεία δίκη πυκνοτέρῳ καὶ αἰω- 12
νίῳ πυρὶ καὶ βασάνοις, αἷς εἰς ὅλον τὸν αἰῶνα οὐκ ἀνήσουσιν σε. Οὐκ 13
ἠδέθης ἄνθρωπος ὢν, θηριωδέστατε, τοὺς ὁμοιοπαθεῖς καὶ ἐκ
τῶν αὐτῶν γεγονότας στοιχείων γλωττοτομῆσαι, καὶ τοῦτον κα-
ταικίσας τὸν τρόπον βασανίσαι; Ἀλλ’ οἱ μὲν εὐγενῶς ἀποθανόντες 14

**CHAPTER XI.**

**22** Armed with goodness and nobility, I also shall die with my brethren.
**23** But thou, O tyrant, shalt bring upon thyself a great avenger, yea, thou thyself,
thou new inventor of tortures, and enemy of them that are truly pious.
**24** As a youth, we have overthrown thy tyranny.
**25** For that thou wast not able to persuade our reason,
**26** neither to compel us unto the eating of abominable things,
is not this thy overthrow? Thy fire is cold unto us,
and the racks are without pain, and thy violence is powerless.
**27** For our champions stand not for a tyrant, but for divine law;
wherefore we have unconquerable reason.

**CHAPTER XII.**

**1** And when this one also had died blessedly, being cast into a cauldron,
**2** the seventh came forth, younger than all [the others].
Whom the tyrant, having pitied—though he had been grievously vexed
by his brethren's defiance—
**3** seeing him now encompassed with chains, sent for him nearer,
and tried to comfort him, saying:
**4** "The end of thy brethren's folly, indeed, thou dost see;
for through disobedience, being racked, they have died.
But thou, if thou wilt not be persuaded, shalt also, O wretched one,
die before thy time, being tortured.
**5** But if thou be persuaded, thou shalt be my friend,
and shalt hold office among the affairs of the kingdom."
**6** And as he exhorted him with these words,
he sent for the mother of the child,
that, having pitied her who was bereft of so many sons,
he might urge her unto [his] salvation,
to make the one who remained obedient.
**7** But when his mother, having exhorted him in the Hebrew tongue
(as we shall say a little later),
**8** said: "Release me, I pray you; that I may say somewhat
to the king and to all his friends that are with him."
**9** And the king and they that were with him,
rejoicing especially at the promise of the child,
**10** quickly released him. And running near unto the frying-pans, he said:
**11** "O impious one," he said, "and thou most godless tyrant of all wicked men,
didst thou not blush, having received good things and the kingdom from God,
and [yet] to slaughter His servants, and to rack the practitioners of piety?
**12** For these things doth divine justice reserve for thee
a denser and eternal fire and torments,
**13** by which throughout all eternity they shall not cease [to afflict] thee.
Didst thou not blush, being a man, O most brutish one,
to cut out the tongues of those who suffer as thou dost
and who are made of the same elements,
and having grievously tormented them in this wise?
**14** But they, indeed, having died nobly,
