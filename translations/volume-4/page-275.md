ΚΕΦ. ΙΕ΄. XVI.
2 υἱοῖς ἀσεβέσιν· ἐὰν πληθύνωσι, μὴ εὐφραίνου ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῖς, εἰ μὴ
3 ἐστι φόβος Κυρίου μετ᾿ αὐτῶν. Μὴ ἐμπιστεύσῃς τῇ ζωῇ αὐτῶν,
4 γίλιος, καὶ ἀποθανεῖν ἄτεκνον ἢ ἔχειν τέκνα ἀσεβῆ· ἀπὸ γὰρ
5 ἑνὸς συνετοῦ συνοικισθήσεται πόλις, φυλὴ δὲ ἀνόμων ἐρημωθήσε-
6 ται ἐν τάχει. Πολλὰ τοιαῦτα ἑώρακα ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς μου, καὶ
7 λῶν ἐκκαυθήσεται πῦρ, καὶ ἐν ἔθνει ἀπειθεῖ ἐξεκαύθη ὀργή. Οὐκ
   ἐξιλάσατο περὶ τῶν ἀρχαίων γιγάντων, οἳ ἀπέστησαν ἐν τῇ ἰ-
8 σχύϊ τῆς ἀφροσύνης αὐτῶν· οὐκ ἐφείσατο περὶ τῆς παροικίας
9 Λὼτ, οὓς ἐξεδέλεατο διὰ τὴν ὑπερηφανίαν αὐτῶν· οὐκ ἠλέησεν
10 ἔθνος ἀπωλείας, τοὺς ἐξηρμένους ἐν ἁμαρτίαις αὐτῶν· καὶ οὕτως
    ἑξακοσίας χιλιάδας πεζῶν τοὺς ἐπισυναχθέντας ἐν σκληροκαρ-
11 δίᾳ αὐτῶν. Κἂν ᾖ εἷς σκληροτράχηλος ἐν λαῷ, θαυμαστὸν τοῦτο
    εἰ ἀθωθήσεται· ἔλεος γὰρ καὶ ὀργὴ παρ᾿ αὐτῷ, δυνάστης ἐξιλα-
12 σμῶν καὶ ἐκχέων ὀργήν· κατὰ τὸ πολὺ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ, οὕτω καὶ
    πολὺς ὁ ἔλεγχος αὐτοῦ· ἄνδρα κατὰ τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ κρίνει. Οὐκ
13 ἐκφεύξεται ἐν ἁρπάγματι ἁμαρτωλός· καὶ οὐ μὴ καθυστερήσει ὑ-
14 πομονὴ εὐσεβοῦς. Πάσῃ ἐλεημοσύνῃ ποιήσει τόπον· ἕκαστος κατὰ
15 τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ εὑρήσει. Κύριος ἐσκλήρυνε Φαραὼ μὴ εἰδέναι αὐ-
16 τόν, ὅπως ἂν γνωσθῇ ἐνεργήματα αὐτοῦ τῇ ὑπ᾿ οὐρανόν. Πάσῃ
    τῇ κτίσει τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ φανερόν, καὶ τὸ φῶς αὐτοῦ καὶ τὸ σκό-
17 τος ἐμέρισε τῷ ἀδάμαντι μὴ εἴπῃς· ἔτι παρὰ Κυρίου κρυβήσο-
    μαι, καὶ ἐξ ὕψους τίς μου μνησθήσεται; ἐν λαῷ πλείονι οὐ μὴ
18 γνωσθῶ, τίς γὰρ ἡ ψυχή μου ἐν ἀμετρήτῳ κτίσει; Ἰδοὺ ὁ οὐρανὸς
    καὶ ὁ οὐρανὸς τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, ἄβυσσος καὶ γῆ καὶ τὰ ἐν αὐτῇ ἐν τῇ
19 ἐπισκοπῇ αὐτοῦ σαλευθήσονται· ἅμα τὰ ὄρη καὶ τὰ θεμέλια τῆς
    γῆς, ἐν τῷ ἐπιβλέψαι εἰς αὐτά, τρόμῳ συσσείονται. Καὶ ἐπ᾿ αὐ-
20 τοῖς οὐ διανοηθήσεται καρδία, καὶ τὰς ἐδοὺς αὐτοῦ τίς ἐνθυμη-
21 θήσεται; Καὶ καταιγὶς, ἣν οὐκ ὄψεται ἄνθρωπος, τὰ δὲ πλείονα
22 τῶν ἔργων αὐτοῦ ἐν ἀποκρύφοις. Ἔργα δικαιοσύνης τίς ἀναγγε-
    λεῖ ἤ τίς ὑπομενεῖ; μακρὰν γὰρ ἡ διαθήκη, καὶ ἐξέτασις ἁπάντων
23 ἐν τελευτῇ ἐλαττονούμενος καρδία διανοεῖται μάταια, καὶ ἀνὴρ
24 ἄφρων καὶ πλανώμενος διανοεῖται μωρά. Ἀκουσόν μου τέκνον,
    καὶ μάθε ἐπιστήμην, καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν λόγων μου πρόσεχε τῇ καρδίᾳ
25 σου· ἐκφανῶ ἐν σταθμῷ παιδείαν, καὶ ἐν ἀκριβείᾳ ἀπαγγελῶ

**Chapter Sixteen**

... ungodly children; if they abound, rejoice not over them, unless 2
the fear of the Lord be with them. Trust thou not in their life, 3
a gilios, and to die childless than to have ungodly children. For from 4
one man of understanding shall a city be settled; but a tribe of lawless men shall be made desolate 5
swiftly. Many such things have I seen with mine own eyes, and 6
[of] sinners, fire shall be kindled, and in a disobedient nation wrath was set ablaze. He did not 7
make propitiation concerning the ancient giants, who did revolt in the might 8
of their folly. He spared not concerning the habitation of 9
Lot, whom He enticed by reason of their pride. He pitied not 10
a nation of perdition, even them that were consumed in their sins; and likewise
six hundred thousand footmen who were gathered together in the hardness 11
of their heart. Even if there be one stiff-necked man among the people, it is a marvel
if he shall be acquitted. For mercy and wrath are with Him; [He is] mighty in for- 12
giveness and pouring forth wrath. According to His great mercy, so also is
His great reproof; He judgeth a man according to his works. A sinner shall not 13
escape through plunder; and the patience of the godly shall not tarry. 14
He shall make room for every [act of] mercy; each man shall find according 15
to his works. The Lord hardened Pharaoh that he should not know Him, 16
that His works might be known unto all that is under heaven. To all 
creation is His mercy manifest, and His light and the darkness He apportioned unto the adamant. 17
Say thou not, "Shall I yet be hidden from the Lord?
And from on high, who shall remember me? Among a great people shall I not 18
be known? For what is my soul amid an immeasurable creation?" Behold, the heaven, 19
and the heaven of heavens, the abyss and the earth and all things therein,
shall be shaken at His visitation. Together the mountains and the foundations of the 20
earth, when He looketh upon them, they are shaken with trembling. And over these things shall
no heart conceive, and His edous, who shall ponder? 21
And a tempest, which no man shall behold; but the greater part 22
of His works are in hidden places. The works of righteousness, who shall declare
or who shall endure? For far is the covenant, and the examination of all things 23
at the end. A heart that is diminished conceiveth vain things, and a foolish man 24
and one that wandereth conceiveth foolish things. Hearken unto me, my son,
and learn understanding; and to my words apply thou thy heart. 25
I will set forth instruction with exactness, and with precision will I declare
