πορεύθητι ἐν Ῥάγοις τῆς Μηδίας παρὰ Γαβαήλ, καὶ κόμισαί μοι τὸ
3 ἀργύριον, καὶ αὐτὸν ἄγε μοι εἰς τὸν γάμον, διότι ἐμώμοχε Ῥα-
4 γουήλ, μὴ ἐξελθεῖν με. Καὶ ὁ πατήρ μου ἀριθμεῖ τὰς ἡμέρας, καὶ
5 ἐὰν χρονίσω μέγα, ὀδυνηθήσεται λίαν. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη Ῥαφαήλ,
καὶ ἠδουλίσατο παρὰ Γαβαήλῳ, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ τὸ χειρόγραφον·
ὃς δὲ προήνεγκε τὰ θυλάκια ἐν ταῖς σφραγῖσιν, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ.
6 Καὶ ὡρθρίσαν κοινῶς, καὶ ἦλθον εἰς τὸν γάμον· καὶ ηὐλόγησε
Τωβίας τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. Ιʹ. Χ.

1 ΚΑΙ Τωβὶτ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ ἐλογίζετο ἑκάστης ἡμέρας· καὶ
2 ὡς ἐπληρώθησαν αἱ ἡμέραι τῆς πορείας, καὶ οὐκ ἤρχοντο, εἶπε
Τωβίτ· μήποτε κατήσχυνται; ἢ μήποτε ἀπέθανε Γαβαήλ, καὶ
3.4 οὐδεὶς δίδωσιν αὐτῷ τὸ ἀργύριον; καὶ ἐλυπεῖτο λίαν. Εἶπε δὲ αὐ-
τῷ ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ· ἀπώλετο τὸ παιδίον, διότι κεχρόνικε· καὶ ἤρ-
5 ξατο θρηνεῖν αὐτὸν, καὶ εἶπεν· οὐ μέλει μοι, τέκνον, ὅτι ἀφῆκά
6 σε τὸ φῶς τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν μου. Καὶ Τωβὶτ λέγει αὐτῇ· σίγα,
7 μὴ λόγον ἔχε, ὑγιαίνει. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· σίγα, μὴ πλάνα με,
ἀπώλετο τὸ παιδίον μου. καὶ ἐπορεύετο καθ᾽ ἡμέραν εἰς τὴν ὁδὸν
ἔξω, οἵας ἀπῆλθαν· ἡμέρας τε ἄρτον οὐκ ἤσθιε, τὰς δὲ νύκτας
ὅλας οὐ διελίμπανε θρηνοῦσα Τωβίαν τὸν υἱὸν αὐτῆς, ἕως οὗ συ-
νετελέσθησαν αἱ δεκατέσσαρες ἡμέραι τοῦ γάμου, ἃς ὤμοσε
Ῥαγουήλ ποιῆσαι αὐτὸν ἐκεῖ· εἶπε δὲ Τωβίας τῷ Ῥαγουήλ· ἐ-
ξαπόστειλόν με, ὅτι ὁ πατήρ μου καὶ ἡ μήτηρ μου οὐκέτι ἐλπί-
8 ζουσιν ὄψεσθαί με. Εἶπε δὲ αὐτῷ ὁ πενθερὸς αὐτοῦ· μεῖνον παρ᾿
ἐμοὶ, κἀγὼ ἐξαποστελῶ πρὸς τὸν πατέρα σου, καὶ δηλώσουσιν
9 αὐτῷ τὰ κατά σε. Καὶ Τωβίας λέγει· οὐχὶ, ἀλλὰ ἐξαπόστει-
10 λόν με πρὸς τὸν πατέρα μου. Ἀναστὰς δὲ Ῥαγουήλ, ἔδωκεν
αὐτῷ Σάρραν τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὸ ἥμισυ τῶν ὑπαρχόντων,
11 σώματα καὶ κτήνη καὶ ἀργύριον· καὶ εὐλογήσας αὐτοὺς ἐξα-
πέστειλε, λέγων· εὐοδώσει ὑμᾶς ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, τέκνα, πρὸ
12 τοῦ με ἀποθανεῖν. Καὶ εἶπε τῇ θυγατρὶ αὐτοῦ· τίμα τοὺς πενθε-
ρούς σου, αὐτοὶ νῦν γονεῖς σου εἰσὶν, ἀκούσαιμί σου ἀκοὴν καλήν·
καὶ ἐφίλησεν αὐτήν. καὶ Ἔδνα εἶπε πρὸς Τωβίαν· ἀδελφὲ ἀγαπη-
τὲ, ἀποκαταστήσαι σε ὁ Κύριος τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ δῴη μοι ἰδεῖν

### CHAPTER 9

[Tobit 9:3]
...go forth into Rages of Media unto Gabael, and fetch for me the money, and bring him to me for the wedding; for Raguel hath sworn that I should not depart.

[Tobit 9:4]
And my father counteth the days, and if I tarry long, he shall be greatly grieved.

[Tobit 9:5]
And Raphael went, and settled [the business] with Gabael, and gave unto him the bond; and he brought forth the pouches with the seals, and gave them unto him.

[Tobit 9:6]

### CHAPTER 10

[Tobit 10:1]
AND Tobit his father reckoned every day;

[Tobit 10:2]
and when the days of the journey were fulfilled, and they came not, Tobit said, "Perchance are they disgraced? Or perchance hath Gabael died, and

[Tobit 10:3]
no man giveth him the money?" And he was exceedingly grieved.

[Tobit 10:4]
But his wife said unto him, "The child hath perished, because he hath tarried long." And she began to lament for him, and said,

[Tobit 10:5]
"It mattereth not to me, O child, that I have let thee go, thou light of mine eyes!"

[Tobit 10:6]
And Tobit saith unto her, "Be silent, speak no [such] word; he is well."

[Tobit 10:7]
And she said unto him, "Be silent, deceive me not; my child hath perished." And she went forth daily into the way whence they had departed; and by day she ate no bread, and all the nights she ceased not to lament Tobiah her son, until the fourteen days of the wedding feast were completed, which Raguel had sworn for him to keep there. And Tobias said unto Raguel, "Send me forth, for my father and my mother no longer hope to see me."

[Tobit 10:8]
But his father-in-law said unto him, "Abide with me, and I will send forth [messengers] unto thy father, and they shall declare unto him the things concerning thee."

[Tobit 10:9]
And Tobias saith, "Nay, but send me forth unto my father."

[Tobit 10:10]
Then Raguel arose, and gave unto him Sarah his wife, and half of his possessions,

[Tobit 10:11]
both bondservants and cattle and money; and having blessed them, he sent them forth, saying, "The God of heaven shall prosper you, children, before I die."

[Tobit 10:12]
And he said unto his daughter, "Honour thy father-in-law and thy mother-in-law, for they are now thy parents; may I hear a good report of thee." And he kissed her. And Edna said unto Tobias, "Beloved brother, may the Lord of heaven restore thee, and grant me to see"
