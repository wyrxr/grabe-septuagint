**33** εἰς τὴν πόλιν Δαυΐδ. Καὶ μετὰ τοὺς λόγους τούτους ἀνέβη
**34** Νικάνωρ εἰς τὸ ὄρος Σιὼν· καὶ ἐξῆλθαν ἀπὸ τῶν ἱερέων ἐκ τῶν ἁγίων καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν πρεσβυτέρων τοῦ λαοῦ ἀσπάσασθαι αὐτὸν εἰρηνικῶς, καὶ δεῖξαι αὐτῷ τὴν ὁλοκαύτωσιν τὴν προσφερομένην ὑπὲρ τοῦ βασιλέως. Καὶ ἐμυκτηρίσεν αὐτούς, καὶ κατεγέλασεν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐμίανεν αὐτούς, καὶ ἐλάλησεν ὑπερηφάνως.
**35** Καὶ ὤμοσε μετὰ θυμοῦ, λέγων· ἐὰν μὴ παραδοθῇ Ἰούδας καὶ ἡ παρεμβολὴ αὐτοῦ τὸ νῦν εἰς χεῖράς μου, καὶ ἔσται ἐὰν ἐπιστρέψω ἐν εἰρήνῃ, ἐμπυριῶ τὸν οἶκον τοῦτον· καὶ ἐξῆλθε μετὰ θυμοῦ μεγάλου.
**36** Καὶ εἰσῆλθον οἱ ἱερεῖς, καὶ ἔστησαν κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου καὶ τοῦ ναοῦ, καὶ ἔκλαυσαν καὶ εἶπαν·
**37** Σύ, Κύριε, ἐξελέξω τὸν οἶκον τοῦτον ἐπικληθῆναι τὸ ὄνομά σου ἐπ᾿ αὐτόν, εἶναι οἶκον προσευχῆς καὶ δεήσεως τῷ λαῷ σου.
**38** Ποίησον ἐκδίκησιν ἐν τῇ ἀνδρώπῳ τούτῳ καὶ ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ αὐτοῦ, καὶ πετάτωσαν ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ· μνήσθητι τῶν δυσφημιῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ μὴ δῶς αὐτοῖς μονήν.
**39** Καὶ ἐξῆλθε Νικάνωρ ἐξ Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ παρενέβαλεν ἐν Βαιθωρὼν, καὶ συνήντησεν αὐτῷ δύναμις Συρίας.
**40** Καὶ Ἰούδας παρενέβαλεν ἐν Ἀδασὰ, ἐν τρισχιλίοις ἀνδράσι· καὶ
**41** προσηύξατο Ἰούδας καὶ εἶπεν· Οἱ παρὰ τοῦ βασιλέως Ἀσσυρίων ὅτε ἐδυσφήμησαν, ἐξῆλθεν ἄγγελός σου, Κύριε, καὶ ἐπάταξεν ἐν αὐτοῖς ἑκατὸν ὀγδοηκονταπέντε χιλιάδας.
**42** Οὕτως σύντριψον τὴν παρεμβολὴν ταύτην ἐνώπιον ἡμῶν σήμερον, καὶ γνωσθήτωσαν οἱ ἐπίλοιποι, ὅτι κακῶς ἐλάλησεν ἐπὶ τὰ ἅγιά σου, καὶ κρῖνον αὐτὸν κατὰ τὴν κακίαν αὐτοῦ.
**43** Καὶ συνῆψαν αἱ παρεμβολαὶ εἰς πόλεμον τῇ τρισκαιδεκάτῃ τοῦ μηνὸς Ἄδαρ, καὶ συνετρίβη ἡ παρεμβολὴ Νικάνορος, καὶ ἔπεσεν αὐτὸς πρῶτος ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ.
**44** Ὡς δὲ εἶδεν ἡ παρεμβολὴ αὐτοῦ, ὅτι ἔπεσε Νικάνωρ, ῥίψαντες τὰ ὅπλα αὐτῶν ἔφυγον.
**45** Καὶ κατεδίωκον αὐτοὺς ὁδὸν ἡμέρας μιᾶς ἀπὸ Ἀδασὰ ἕως τοῦ ἐλθεῖν εἰς Γάζηρα, καὶ ἐσάλπισαν ὀπίσω αὐτῶν ταῖς σάλπιγξι τῶν σημασιῶν.
**46** Καὶ ἐξῆλθον ἐκ πασῶν τῶν κωμῶν τῆς Ἰουδαίας κυκλόθεν, καὶ ὑπερεκόψαν αὐτοὺς, καὶ ἀνέστρεφον οὗτοι πρὸς τούτοις, καὶ ἔπεσαν πάντες ῥομφαίᾳ, καὶ οὐ κατελείφθη ἐξ αὐτῶν οὐδὲ εἷς.
**47** Καὶ ἔλαβον τὰ σκῦλα καὶ τὴν προνομήν, καὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν Νικάνορος ἀφεῖλαν, καὶ τὴν δεξιὰν αὐτοῦ, ἣν ἐξέτεινεν ὑπερηφάνως, καὶ ἤνεγκαν, καὶ ἐξέτειναν παρὰ τὴν Ἱερουσαλήμ.
**48** Καὶ ηὐφράνθη ὁ λαὸς σφόδρα, καὶ ἤγαγον

**Chapter 7**

**33** unto the city of David. And after these words, Nicanor ascended unto Mount Zion; and there came forth from the priests, from the holy places, and from the elders of the people, to greet him peaceably, and to show him the burnt offering which was made for the king.
**34** But he scoffed at them, and derided them, and defiled them, and spake with great arrogance.
**35** And he swore with fury, saying, "Unless Judas and his host be delivered now into mine hands, then it shall be, if I return in peace, that I will burn this house with fire." And he departed with great wrath.
**36** Then the priests entered, and stood before the altar and the Temple, and they wept and said,
**37** "Thou, O Lord, hast chosen this House, that Thy Name should be called upon it, to be a house of prayer and supplication for Thy people.
**38** Execute vengeance upon this man and upon his host; and let them be scattered by the sword. Remember their blasphemies, and grant them no abiding place."
**39** And Nicanor departed from Jerusalem, and encamped in Beth-horon; and a force from Syria met him there.
**40** And Judas encamped in Adasa, with three thousand men. And
**41** Judas prayed and said, "When those of the king of the Assyrians did speak blasphemy, there went forth Thine angel, O Lord, and smote among them a hundred fourscore and five thousand.
**42** Even so crush Thou this host before us this day, and let the remnant know that he hath spoken evil against Thy holy places; and judge Thou him according to his wickedness."
**43** So the armies joined in battle on the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and Nicanor's host was crushed, and he himself fell first in the battle.
**44** And when his host saw that Nicanor was fallen, they cast down their weapons and fled.
**45** And Judas' men pursued them for the space of one day's journey, from Adasa even until they came unto Gazara; and they sounded the trumpets of signals after them.
**46** And there came forth from all the villages of Judea round about, and cut them off exceedingly; and these turned back upon those, and all of them fell by the sword, and not even one of them was left.
**47** And they took the spoils and the plunder; and they cut off the head of Nicanor, and his right hand, which he had stretched forth with arrogance; and they brought them and displayed them before Jerusalem.
**48** And the people rejoiced exceedingly, and they kept
