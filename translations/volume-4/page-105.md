**ΜΑΚΚΑΒΑΙΩΝ Α´. ΚΕΦ. Η´. Θ´.**
συμβῇ προτέροις πόλεμος, συμμαχήσουσιν οἱ ῾Ρωμαῖοι ἐκ ψυχῆς,
ὡς ἂν αὐτοῖς ὁ καιρὸς ὑπογραφῇ. Καὶ τοῖς συμμαχοῦσιν οὐ
δοθήσεται σῖτος, ὅπλα, ἀργύριον, πλοῖα, ὡς ἔδοξε ῾Ρώμῃ· καὶ φυ-
λάξονται τὰ φυλάγματα αὐτῶν, καὶ οὐ μετὰ δόλου. Κατὰ τοὺς
λόγους τούτους οὕτως ἔστησαν ῾Ρωμαῖοι τῷ δήμῳ τῶν ᾿Ιου-
δαίων. ᾿Εὰν δὲ μετὰ τοὺς λόγους τούτους βουλεύσωνται οὗτοι
καὶ οὗτοι προσθεῖναι ἢ ἀφελεῖν, ποιήσονται ἐξ αἱρέσεως αὑτῶν,
καὶ ὃ ἐὰν προσθῶσιν ἢ ἀφέλωσιν ἔσται κύρια. Καὶ περὶ τῶν κα-
κῶν, ὧν ὁ βασιλεὺς Δημήτριος συντελεῖται εἰς αὐτοὺς, ἐγράψα-
μεν αὐτῷ λέγοντες· διατί ἐβάρυνας τὸν ζυγόν σου ἐπὶ τοὺς φί-
λους ἡμῶν τοὺς συμμάχους ᾿Ιουδαίους; ᾿Εὰν οὖν ἔτι ἐντύχωσι
κατὰ σοῦ, ποιήσομεν αὐτοῖς τὴν κρίσιν, καὶ πολεμήσομέν σε διὰ
τῆς θαλάσσης καὶ διὰ τῆς ξηρᾶς.

**ΚΕΦ. Θ´. ΙΧ.**

ΚΑΙ ἤκουσε Δημήτριος, ὅτι ἔπεσε Νικάνωρ καὶ αἱ δυνάμεις
αὐτοῦ ἐν πολέμῳ, καὶ προσέθετο τὸν Βακχίδην καὶ τὸν ῎Αλκι-
μον ἐκ δευτέρου ἀποστεῖλαι εἰς γῆν ᾿Ιούδα, καὶ τὸ δεξιὸν κέρας
μετ᾿ αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν ὁδὸν τὴν εἰς Γάλγαλα, καὶ πα-
ρενέβαλον ἐπὶ Μεσσαλὼθ τὴν ἐν ᾿Αρβήλοις, καὶ προκατελά-
βοντο αὐτήν, καὶ ἀπώλεσαν ψυχὰς ἀνθρώπων πολλάς. Καὶ τοῦ
μηνὸς τοῦ πρώτου ἔτους δευτέρου καὶ πεντηκοστοῦ καὶ ἑκατοστοῦ
παρενέβαλον ἐπὶ ῾Ιερουσαλήμ. Καὶ ἀπῆραν καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν εἰς Βε-
ρέαν ἐν εἴκοσι χιλιάσιν ἀνδρῶν καὶ δισχιλιάσιν ἵππων. Καὶ ᾿Ιούδας
ἦν παρεμβεβληκὼς ἐν ᾿Ελεασᾶ, καὶ τρισχίλιοι ἄνδρες ἐκλεκτοὶ μετ᾿
αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἴδον τὸ πλῆθος τῶν δυνάμεων, ὅτι πολλοί εἰσι, καὶ
ἐφοβήθησαν σφόδρα· καὶ ἐξερρύησαν πολλοὶ ἀπὸ τῆς παρεμβολῆς,
οὐ κατελείφθησαν ἐξ αὐτῶν ἀλλ᾿ ἢ ὀκτακόσιοι ἄνδρες. Καὶ ἴδεν
᾿Ιούδας, ὅτι ἀπεῤῥύη ἡ παρεμβολὴ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὁ πόλεμος ἐθλί-
βεν αὐτόν· καὶ συνετρίβη τῇ καρδίᾳ, ὅτι οὐκ εἶχε καιρὸν συγχαι-
ρεῖν αὐτούς. Καὶ ἐξελύθη, καὶ εἶπε τοῖς καταλειφθεῖσιν· ἀναστῶμεν
καὶ ἀναβῶμεν ἐπὶ τοὺς ὑπεναντίους ἡμῶν, ἐὰν ἄρα δυνώμεθα
πολεμῆσαι αὐτούς. Καὶ ἀπέστρεψαν αὐτόν, λέγοντες· οὐ μὴ
δυνήσόμεθα, ἀλλ᾿ ἢ σώσωμεν τὰς ἑαυτῶν ψυχὰς τὸ νῦν, καὶ
ἐπιστρέψωμεν μετὰ τῶν ἀδελφῶν ἡμῶν, καὶ πολεμήσωμεν πρὸς

**27** should war befall the nation of the Jews first, then shall the Romans fight alongside [them] with a full heart, as the occasion shall be prescribed unto them. And unto those who fight alongside [them] shall neither grain, nor weapons, nor silver, nor ships be given, as it seemed good unto Rome. And they shall guard their own garrisons, and that without guile.
**28** According to these words, thus did the Romans ratify [this covenant] with the people of the Jews.
**29** But if, after these words, both these [parties] and those [parties] should purpose to add thereto or to diminish therefrom, they shall do so by their own choice; and whatsoever they shall add or remove shall be binding.
**30** And concerning the evils which King Demetrius doth inflict upon them, we have written unto him, saying: “Wherefore hast thou made thy yoke heavy upon our friends, the allied Jews?”
**31** “If, therefore, they should yet appeal unto us concerning thee, we shall do them justice, and we shall make war against thee by sea and by land.”

**Chapter 9**

**1** Now when Demetrius heard that Nicanor and his forces were fallen in battle, he resolved, moreover, to send Bacchides and Alcimus a second time into the land of Judah, and the right wing [of his host] with them.
**2** And they journeyed by the way unto Galgala; and they pitched their camp upon Messaloth, which is in Arbela; and they seized it beforehand, and they destroyed many souls of men.
**3** And in the first month of the one hundred and fifty-second year, they encamped against Jerusalem.
**4** And they departed and went unto Berea with twenty thousand men and two thousand horses.
**5** And Judas was encamped in Eleasa, and three thousand men, chosen [for valor], were with him.
**6** And they saw the multitude of the forces, that they were many; and they feared greatly. And many slipped away from the camp, and there were none left of them, save only eight hundred men.
**7** And Judas saw that his camp had slipped away, and the war sorely pressed him; and he was broken in heart, because he had not time to rally them.
**8** And he was utterly disheartened, and he said unto those who were left: “Let us arise and go up against our adversaries, if by any means we may be able to fight them.”
**9** And they turned him back, saying: “We shall surely not be able [to do this]; but rather let us now save our own lives, and let us return with our brethren, and fight against…”
