τῶν τοῦ Βακχήνορος, ἔφιππος ἀνὴρ καὶ καρτερός, εἴχετο τοῦ Γορ-
γίου, καὶ λαβόμενος τῆς χλαμύδος, ἦγεν αὐτὸν εὐρώστως, καὶ
βουλόμενος τὸν κατάρακτον λαβεῖν ζωγρεῖν, τῶν ἱππέων Θρα-
κῶν τινος ἐπενεχθέντος αὐτῷ, καὶ τὸν ὦμον καθελόντος, διέ-
φυγεν ὁ Γοργίας εἰς Μαρισά. Τῶν δὲ περὶ τὸν Ἔσδριν ἐπι- 36
πλέον μαχομένων, καὶ κατακόπων ὄντων, ἐπικαλεσάμενος ὁ Ἰού-
δας τὸν Κύριον σύμμαχον φανῆναι καὶ πρεσδιηγὸν τοῦ πολέμου,
καταρξάμενος τῇ πατρίῳ φωνῇ τὴν μεθ’ ὕμνων κραυγήν, ἀναβόη- 37
σας, καὶ ἐνέσεισε αἰσίας ἀπροσδοκήτους τοῖς περὶ τὸν Γοργίαν, τροπὴν
αὐτῶν ἐποιήσατο. Ἰούδας δὲ ἀναλαβὼν τὸ στράτευμα, ἦγεν εἰς 38
Ὠδολλάμ πόλιν τῆς δὲ ἑβδομάδος ἐπιβαλλούσης, κατὰ τὸν ἐθι-
σμὸν ἀγνισθέντες αὐτόθι τὸ σάββατον διήγαγον. Τῇ δὲ ἐχομένῃ 39
ἦλθον οἱ περὶ τὸν Ἰούδαν, καθ’ ὃν τρόπον τὸ τῆς χρείας ἐγεγό-
νει, τὰ σώματα τῶν προπεπτωκότων ἀνακομίσασθαι, καὶ μετὰ
τῶν συγγενῶν ἀποκαταστῆσαι εἰς τοὺς πατρῴους τάφους. Εὗ- 40
ρον δὲ ἑκάστου τῶν τεθνηκότων ὑπὸ τοὺς χιτῶνας ἱερώματα
τῶν ἀπὸ Ἰαμνείας εἰδώλων, ἀφ’ ὧν ὁ νόμος ἀπείργει τοὺς Ἰου-
δαίους· τοῖς δὲ πᾶσι σαφὲς ἐγένετο διὰ τήνδε τὴν αἰτίαν τοὺς
δὲ πεπτωκέναι. Πάντες οὖν εὐλογήσαντες τὰ τοῦ δικαιοκρίτου 41
Κυρίου τοῦ τὰ κεικρυμμένα φανερὰ ποιοῦντος, εἰς ἱκετείαν ἐτρά- 42
πησαν, ἀξιώσαντες τὸ γεγονὸς ἁμάρτημα τελείως ἐξαλειφθῆναι·
ὁ δὲ γενναῖος Ἰούδας παρεκάλεσε τὸ πλῆθος συντηρεῖν ἑαυτοὺς
ἀναμαρτήτους εἶναι, ὑπ’ ὄψιν ἔωρακὼς τὰ γεγονότα, διὰ τὴν
τῶν πεπτωκότων ἁμαρτίαν. Ποιησάμενος τε κατ’ ἀνδρολογίαν 43
κατασκευάσματα εἰς ἀργυρίου δραχμὰς δισχιλίας, ἀπέστειλεν εἰς
Ἱεροσόλυμα προσαγαγεῖν περὶ ἁμαρτίας θυσίαν, πάνυ καλῶς καὶ
ἀστείως πράττων, ὑπὲρ ἀναστάσεως διαλογιζόμενος. (Εἰ γὰρ μὴ 44
τοὺς προπεπτωκότας ἀναστῆναι προσεδόκα, περισσὸν ἂν ἦν, καὶ
ληρῶδες ὑπὲρ νεκρῶν προσεύχεσθαι). Ἐπεβλέπων τοῖς μετ’ 45
εὐσεβείας κοιμωμένοις κάλλιστον ἀποκείμενον χαριστήριον. Ὁ- 46
σία καὶ εὐσεβὴς ἡ ἐπίνοια· ὅθεν περὶ τῶν τεθνηκότων τὸν ἐξι-
λασμὸν ἐποιήσατο τῆς ἁμαρτίας ἀπολυθῆναι.

**Chapter 12**

**35** ...[But] a certain Dositheus, one of the company of Bachenor, a horseman valiant and strong, laid hold upon Gorgias; and seizing him by his cloak, he drew him forth with might, intending to take the accursed one alive captive. But as one of the Thracian horsemen fell upon him and smote him upon the shoulder, Gorgias escaped unto Marisa.
**36** But whilst those who were with Esdris did fight more fiercely, and were wearied, Judas invoked the Lord, that He would appear as an ally and director of the war,
**37** And beginning the shout of battle in his native tongue with hymns, when he had cried aloud and had caused unexpected portents unto those who were with Gorgias, he brought about their utter rout.
**38** Then Judas, having gathered his army, led them unto the city of Adullam. And as the week was drawing nigh, they purified themselves there according to the custom, and kept the Sabbath.
**39** And on the morrow, they that were with Judas came, as it was needful for them, to take up the bodies of those that had fallen, and with their kinsfolk to lay them in the sepulchers of their fathers.
**40** But under the garments of each one of the dead, they found sacred tokens of the idols of Jamnia, from which the Law doth forbid the Jews; and it was made plain unto all, that for this cause had they fallen.
**41** Therefore all blessed the Lord, the righteous Judge, Who doth reveal the hidden things; and they turned to supplication,
**42** Beseeching that the sin which had been committed might be utterly blotted out. Then the noble Judas exhorted the multitude to keep themselves without sin, having seen before their eyes that which had come to pass, by reason of the sin of those that had fallen.
**43** And having made a collection, man by man, of two thousand drachmas of silver, he sent it unto Jerusalem to offer a sacrifice for sin; acting herein very well and honorably, considering the resurrection [of the dead].
**44** (For if he had not expected that those who had fallen would rise again, it would have been superfluous and vain to pray for the dead.)
**45** And he looked unto those who with godliness had fallen asleep, believing that a most excellent recompense was reserved [for them].
**46** A holy and pious thought it was; wherefore he made a propitiation for the dead, that they might be absolved from their sin.
