ΚΑΙ βασιλεὺς Δαρεῖος ἐποίησε δοχὴν μεγάλην πᾶσι τοῖς ὑπ᾿ 1
αὑτόν, καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς οἰκογενέσιν αὑτοῦ, καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς μεγιστᾶ-
σι τῆς Μηδίας καὶ τῆς Περσίδος, καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς σατράπαις καὶ 2
στρατηγοῖς καὶ τοπάρχαις τοῖς ὑπ᾿ αὑτόν, ἀπὸ τῆς Ἰνδικῆς μέ-
χρι τῆς Αἰθιοπίας ἐν ταῖς ἑκατὸν εἴκοσιεπτὰ σατραπείαις. Καὶ ὅτε 3
ἔρχον καὶ ἔπιον, καὶ ἐμπλησθέντες ἀνέλυσαν, τότε Δαρεῖος ὁ βα-
σιλεὺς ἀνέλυσεν εἰς τὸν κοιτῶνα ἑαυτοῦ, καὶ ἐκοιμήθη, καὶ ἔξυ-
πνος ἐγένετο. Τότε οἱ τρεῖς νεανίσκοι οἱ σωματοφύλακες οἱ φυ- 4
λάττοντες τὸ σῶμα τοῦ βασιλέως, εἶπαν ἕτερος τῷ ἑτέρῳ· εἴπωμεν 5
ἕκαστος ἡμῶν ἕνα λόγον, ὃς ὑπερισχύσει, καὶ οὗ ἐὰν φανῇ τὸ ῥῆ-
μα αὑτοῦ σοφώτερον τοῦ ἑτέρου, δώσει αὑτῷ Δαρεῖος ὁ βασιλεὺς
δωρεὰς μεγάλας, καὶ ἐπινίκια μεγάλα, καὶ πορφύραν περιβαλέσθαι, 6
καὶ ἐν χρυσώματι πίνειν, καὶ ἐπὶ χρυσῇ καθεύδειν, καὶ ἅρμα χρυσο-
χάλινον, καὶ κίθαριν βυσσίνην, καὶ μανιάκην περὶ τὸν τράχηλον
αὑτοῦ, καὶ δεύτερος καθίσεται Δαρείου διὰ τὴν σοφίαν ἑαυτοῦ, 7
καὶ συγγενὴς Δαρείου κληθήσεται. Καὶ τότε γράψαντες ἕκαστος 8
τὸν ἑαυτοῦ λόγον, ἐσφραγίσαντο καὶ ἔθηκαν ὑπὸ τὸ προσκεφάλαιον
Δαρείου τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ εἶπαν· ὅταν ἐγερθῇ ὁ βασιλεύς, 9
δώσουσιν αὑτῷ τὸ γράμμα. καὶ ὃν κρίνῃ ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ οἱ τρεῖς
μεγιστᾶνες τῆς Περσίδος, ὅτι ὁ λόγος αὑτοῦ σοφώτερος, αὑτῷ
δοθήσεται τὸ νίκημα καθὼς γέγραπται. Ὁ εἷς ἔγραφεν, ὑπερι- 10
σχύει ὁ οἶνος. Ὁ ἕτερος ἔγραφεν, ὑπερισχύει ὁ βασιλεύς. Ὁ τρίτος
ἔγραφεν, ὑπερισχύουσιν αἱ γυναῖκες, ὑπὲρ δὲ πάντα νικᾷ ἡ 11.12
ἀλήθεια. Καὶ ὅτε ἐξηγέρθη ὁ βασιλεύς, λαβόντες τὸ γράμμα ἐπέ- 13
δωκαν αὑτῷ, καὶ ἀνέγνω. Καὶ ἐξαποστείλας ἐκάλεσε πάντας τοὺς 14
μεγιστάνας τῆς Περσίδος καὶ τῆς Μηδίας, καὶ σατράπας καὶ στρα-
τηγούς, καὶ τοπάρχας καὶ ὑπάτους, καὶ ἐκάθισεν ἐν τῷ χρημα-
τιστηρίῳ, καὶ ἀνεγνώσθη τὸ γράμμα ἐνώπιον αὑτῶν. Καὶ εἶπε· 15
καλέσατε τοὺς νεανίσκους, καὶ αὑτοὶ δηλώσουσι τοὺς λόγους ἑαυ-
τῶν. καὶ ἐκλήθησαν, καὶ εἰσῆλθον. Καὶ εἶπαν αὑτοῖς· ἀπαγγείλατε 16
ἡμῖν περὶ τῶν γεγραμμένων· καὶ ἤρξατο ὁ πρῶτος ὁ εἴ-
πας περὶ τῆς ἰσχύος τοῦ οἴνου, καὶ ἔφη οὕτως. Ἄνδρες, πῶς ὑπε- 17
ρισχύει ὁ οἶνος ; πάντας τοὺς ἀνθρώπους τοὺς πίνοντας αὑτὸν πλανᾷ

**Chapter III.**

**1** And King Darius made a great feast unto all them that were under him, and unto all his household, and unto all the nobles of Media and Persia;
**2** and unto all the satraps and captains and governors that were under him, from India even unto Ethiopia, in the one hundred and twenty-seven satrapies.
**3** And when they came and drank, and were filled, they then departed. Then Darius the king departed into his own bedchamber, and slept, and awoke.
**4** Then the three young men, the bodyguards who kept the king's person,
**5** spake one unto another, saying, "Let each of us speak one word which shall prevail; and of whomsoever his word shall appear wiser than that of the other, to him shall Darius the king give great gifts and great rewards of victory,
**6** and [grant him] to be clothed in purple, and to drink from golden vessels, and to sleep upon a bed of gold, and a chariot with golden bridles, and a harp of fine linen, and a necklace about his neck,
**7** and he shall sit second unto Darius by reason of his wisdom, and shall be called the kinsman of Darius."
**8** And then, having written each one his own word, they sealed it and laid it under the pillow of Darius the king, and said,
**9** "When the king shall rise, they shall give unto him the writing; and whom the king and the three nobles of Persia shall judge, that his word is wiser, to him shall be given the prize of victory, as it is written."
**10** The one wrote, "Wine is strongest."
**11** The other wrote, "The king is strongest."
**12** The third wrote, "Women are strongest, but above all things doth Truth conquer."
**13** And when the king was awakened, they took the writing and delivered it unto him, and he read it.
**14** And having sent forth, he called all the nobles of Persia and Media, and satraps and captains, and governors and chief officers, and he sat down in the council-chamber, and the writing was read before them.
**15** And he said, "Call the young men, and they themselves shall declare their words." And they were called, and they came in.
**16** And he said unto them, "Declare unto us concerning the things that are written." And the first, who spake concerning the strength of wine, began and spake thus:
**17** "O men, how doth wine prevail? It doth lead astray in mind all men that drink it;
