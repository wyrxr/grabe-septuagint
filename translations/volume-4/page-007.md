ΚΕΦ. Γ΄.
ἐντολῶν σου, καὶ ἔδωκας ἡμᾶς εἰς ἁρπαγὴν καὶ αἰχμαλωσίαν
καὶ θάνατον καὶ παραβολὴν ὀνειδισμοῦ πᾶσι τοῖς ἔθνεσιν ἐν οἷς
8 ἐσκορπίσμεθα. Καὶ νῦν πολλαὶ αἱ κρίσεις σου εἰσὶ καὶ ἀληθιναί·
ἐξ ἐμοῦ ποιῆσαι περὶ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν μου καὶ τῶν πατέρων μου,
ὅτι οὐκ ἐποιήσαμεν τὰς ἐντολάς σου, οὐ γὰρ ἐπορεύθημεν ἐν ἀληθείᾳ
ἐνώπιόν σου. 6 Καὶ νῦν κατὰ τὸ ἀρεστὸν ἐνώπιόν σου
ποίησον μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ· ἐπίταξον ἀναλαβεῖν τὸ πνεῦμά μου, ὅπως
ἀπολυθῶ, καὶ γένωμαι γῆ, διότι λυσιτελεῖ μοι μᾶλλον ἀποθανεῖν,
ἢ ζῆν· ὅτι ὀνειδισμοὺς ψευδεῖς ἤκουσα, καὶ λύπη ἐστὶ πολ-
λὴ ἐν ἐμοί. ἐπίταξον ἀπολυθῆναί με τῆς ἀνάγκης ἤδη εἰς τὸν
7 αἰώνιον τόπον, μὴ ἀποστρέψῃς τὸ πρόσωπόν σου ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ. Ἐν
τῇ αὐτῇ ἡμέρᾳ συνέβη τῇ θυγατρὶ ῾Ραγουήλ Σάρρᾳ ἐν Ἐκβα-
τάνοις τῆς Μηδίας, καὶ ταύτην ὀνειδισθῆναι ἀπὸ παιδισκῶν τοῦ
8 πατρὸς αὐτῆς, ὅτι ἦν δεδομένη ἀνδράσιν ἑπτά, καὶ ᾿Ασμοδαῖος
τὸ πονηρὸν δαιμόνιον ἀπέκτεινεν αὐτούς, πρὶν γενέσθαι αὐτοὺς
μετ᾿ αὐτῆς ὡς ἐν γυναιξί. 9 Καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῇ· οὐ συνιεῖς ἀποπνίγουσα
σου τοὺς ἄνδρας; ἤδη ἑπτὰ ἔσχες, καὶ ἑνὸς αὐτῶν οὐκ
10 ὠνομάσθης. Τί ἡμᾶς μαστιγοῖς; εἰ ἀπέθαναν, βάδιζε μετ᾿ αὐ-
11 τῶν, μὴ ἴδοιμέν σου υἱὸν ἢ θυγατέρα εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα. Ταῦτα ἀ-
κούσασα ἐλυπήθη σφόδρα, ὥστε ἀπάγξασθαι· καὶ εἶπε· μία μὲν
εἰμι τῷ πατρί μου, ἐὰν ποιήσω τοῦτο, ὄνειδος αὐτῷ ἔσται, καὶ
12 τὸ γῆρας αὐτοῦ κατάξω μετ᾿ ὀδύνης εἰς ᾅδου· καὶ ἐδεήθη πρὸς
τῇ θυρίδι, καὶ εἶπεν· εὐλογητὸς εἶ Κύριε ὁ Θεός μου, καὶ εὐλογητὸν
τὸ ὄνομά σου τὸ ἅγιον καὶ ἔντιμον εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας·
13 εὐλογήσαισάν σε πάντα τὰ ἔργα σου εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα. Καὶ νῦν,
Κύριε, τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς μου καὶ τὸ πρόσωπόν μου εἰς σὲ δέδωκα.
14 Εἶπον, ἀπολῦσαί με ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς, καὶ μὴ ἀκοῦσαί με μηκέτι ὀνειδισμόν.
15 Σὺ γινώσκεις, Κύριε, ὅτι καθαρά εἰμι ἀπὸ πάσης ἀ-
μαρτίας ἀνδρός, καὶ οὐκ ἐμόλυνα τὸ ὄνομά μου οὐδὲ τὸ ὄνομα
τοῦ πατρός μου ἐν τῇ γῇ αἰχμαλωσίας μου· μονογενὴς εἰμι τῷ
πατρί μου, καὶ οὐχ ὑπάρχει αὐτῷ παιδίον ὃ κληρονομήσει αὐτόν,
οὐδὲ ἀδελφὸς ἐγγύς, οὐδὲ ὑπάρχων αὐτῷ υἱός, ἵνα συντηρήσω
ἐμαυτὴν αὐτῷ γυναῖκα, ἤδη ἀπώλοντό μοι ἑπτά· ἵνα τί μοι ζῆν;
καὶ εἰ μὴ δοκεῖ σοι ἀποκτεῖναί με, ἐπίταξον ἐπιβλέψαι ἐπ᾿ ἐμέ,
16 καὶ ἐλεῆσαί με, καὶ μηκέτι ἀκοῦσαί με ὀνειδισμόν. Καὶ εἰσήκουσε
Κύριος τῆς προσευχῆς ἀμφοτέρων ἐνώπιον τῆς δόξης τοῦ μεγα-

[Tobit 3:4]
Thy commandments, and Thou didst deliver us into pillage and captivity,
and unto death, and [didst make us] a proverb of reproach unto all the nations
among whom we are scattered.

[Tobit 3:5]
And now, many are Thy judgments and true are they,
that Thou shouldst deal with me concerning my sins and the sins of my fathers;
for we have not kept Thy commandments,
neither have we walked in truth before Thee.

[Tobit 3:6]
And now, deal with me according to that which is pleasing in Thy sight;
command Thou [my spirit] to be taken up,
that I may be loosed and return to the earth.
For it is more profitable for me to die than to live,
seeing I have heard false reproaches, and great sorrow is within me.
Command [me] to be delivered from this distress even now,
unto the eternal place; turn not Thy countenance from me.

[Tobit 3:7]
On that same day, it befell Sarah, the daughter of Raguel, in Ecbatana of Media,
that she likewise was reproached by her father's handmaidens;
for she had been given unto seven men, and Asmodeus, the evil demon, slew them,
ere they had lain with her after the manner of women.

[Tobit 3:8]
And they said unto her, "Dost thou not perceive that thou art stifling thy husbands?
Seven indeed hast thou already had, and of not one of them hast thy name been called."

[Tobit 3:9]
"Wherefore dost thou scourge us? If they be dead, go thou with them,
that we may behold neither thy son nor thy daughter forevermore!"

[Tobit 3:10]
Now when she had heard these words, she was exceeding grieved,
insomuch that she purposed to hang herself;
but she said, "I am indeed the only daughter to my father;
if I do this, it shall be a reproach unto him,
and I shall bring his old age down with sorrow into Hades."

[Tobit 3:11]
And she made supplication by the window, saying,
"Blessed art Thou, O Lord my God, and blessed be Thy holy and venerable Name unto the ages."

[Tobit 3:12]
"May all Thy works bless Thee unto the age.
And now, O Lord, mine eyes and my countenance have I uplifted unto Thee."

[Tobit 3:13]
"I have spoken, [praying Thee] to release me from the earth,
and that I may hear reproach no more."

[Tobit 3:14]
"Thou knowest, O Lord, that I am clean from every sin of man,"

[Tobit 3:15]
"Neither have I defiled my name, nor the name of my father, in the land of my captivity.
I am an only child to my father, and there is no child for him to inherit him,
nor any near kinsman, nor any son existing for him,
that I might maintain myself [as] a wife for him [to preserve his lineage].
Seven indeed have already perished unto me. Wherefore should I live?
And if it pleaseth Thee not to slay me, command to look upon me,
and to show mercy unto me, and that I hear reproach no more."

[Tobit 3:16]
And the Lord did hear the prayer of them both before the glory of the Great...
