    νειαν, μέχρι ἂν συντελεσθῇ τοῦτο. Οἱ καὶ δεσμίους καταγαγόν- 5
    τες αὐτοὺς μετὰ σκυλμῶν ὡς ἀνδράποδα, μᾶλλον δὲ ὡς ἐπιβού-
    λους, ἄνευ πάσης ἀνακρίσεως καὶ ἐξετάσεως ἐπεχείρησαν ἀνελεῖν,
    νόμου Σκυθῶν ἀγριοτέραν ἐμπεπορνημένοι ὠμότητα. Ἡμεῖς δὲ ἐπὶ 6
    τούτοις σκληρότερον διαπειλησάμενοι, καθ’ ἣν ἔχομεν πρὸς ἅπαντας
    ἀνθρώπους ἐπιείκειαν, μόγις τὸ ζῆν αὐτοῖς χαριζόμενοι, καὶ τὸν ἐ-
    πουράνιον Θεὸν ἐγνωκότες ἀσφαλῶς ὑπερασπικότα τῶν Ἰουδαίων, ὡς
    πατέρα ὑπὲρ υἱῶν διαπαντὸς ὑπερμαχοῦντα, τήν τε τοῦ φίλου δι’ 7
    ἦν ἔχουσι βεβαίαν πρὸς ἡμᾶς καὶ τοὺς προγόνους ἡμῶν εὔνοιαν ἀνα-
    λογισάμενοι, δικαίως ἀπολελύκαμεν, πάσης καθ’ οὑντινοῦν αἰτίας
    τρόπον. Καὶ προσετετάχαμεν ἑκάστῳ πάντας εἰς τὰ ἴδια ἐπι- 8
    στρέφειν, ἐν παντὶ τόπῳ μηδενὸς αὐτοὺς τὸ σύνολον καταβλά-
    πτοντος, μήτε ὀνειδίζοντος περὶ τῶν γεγενημένων παρὰ λόγον.
    Γινώσκετε γὰρ, ὅτι κατὰ τούτων ἐάν τι κακοτεχνήσωμεν πον- 9
    ηρὸν, ἢ ἐπιλυπήσωμεν αὐτοὺς τὸ σύνολον, οὐκ ἄνθρωπον, ἀλλὰ
    τὸν πάσης δεσπόζοντα δυνάμεως Θεὸν ὕψιστον ἀντικείμενον ἡμῖν
    ἐπ’ ἐκδικήσει τῶν πραγμάτων κατὰ πᾶν ἀφεύκτως διαπαντὸς ἔξο-
    μεν· ἔρρωσθε. Λαβόντες δὲ τὴν ἐπιστολὴν ταύτην, οὐκ ἐσπού- 10
    δασαν εὐθέως περὶ τὴν ἄφοδον, ἀλλὰ τὸν βασιλέα προσηξίωσαν
    τοὺς ἐκ τοῦ γένους τῶν Ἰουδαίων τὸν ἅγιον Θεὸν αὐθαιρέτως
    παραβεβηκότας καὶ τοῦ Θεοῦ τὸν νόμον, τυχεῖν δι’ αὑτῶν τῆς
    ὀφειλομένης κολάσεως, προσφερόμενοι τοὺς γαστρὸς ἕνεκεν τὰ θεῖα 11
    παραβεβηκότας προστάγματα, μηδέποτε εὐνοήσειν μηδὲ τοῖς τοῦ
    βασιλέως πράγμασιν. Ὁ δὲ τ’ ἀληθὲς αὐτοὺς λέγειν παραδε- 12
    ξάμενος καὶ συναινέσας, ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς ἄδειαν πάντων, ὅπως
    τοὺς παραβεβηκότας τοῦ Θεοῦ τὸν νόμον ἐξολεθρεύσωσι κατὰ
    πάντα τὸν ὑπὸ τὴν βασιλείαν αὑτοῦ τόπον μετὰ παῤῥησίας, ἄνευ
    πάσης βασιλικῆς ἐξουσίας καὶ ἐπισκέψεως. Τότε κατευφημήσαν- 13
    τες αὐτὸν, ὡς πρέπον ἦν, οἱ τούτων ἱερεῖς καὶ πᾶν τὸ πλῆθος
    ἐπιφωνήσαντες τὸ ἀλληλούϊα, μετὰ χαρᾶς ἀνέλυσαν. Τότε τὸν 14
    ἐμπεσόντα τῶν μεμιγμένων ὁμοεθνῆ κατὰ τὴν ὁδὸν ἐκολάζοντο,
    καὶ μετὰ παραδειγματισμῶν ἀνήρουν. Ἐκείνη δὲ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἀνεῖ- 15
    λον ὑπὲρ τοὺς τριακοσίους ἄνδρας, καὶ ἤγαγον εὐφροσύνην
    μετὰ χαρᾶς τοὺς βεβήλους χειρωσάμενοι. Αὐτοὶ δὲ οἱ μέχρι 16
    θανάτου τὸν Θεὸν ἐσχηκότες, παντελῆ σωτηρίας ἀπόλαυσιν εἶ-
    ληφότες, ἀνέζευξαν ἐκ τῆς πόλεως παντοίοις εὐωδεστάτοις ἀνθέσι

    **III Maccabees, Chapter 7**

    **5** ...ill-will, until this be accomplished. And they, having brought them down in bonds with much spoil, as bondmen, yea, rather as traitors, essayed to slay them without any inquiry or examination,
    **6** having embraced a cruelty more savage than the law of the Scythians. But we, having issued sterner threats concerning these matters, according to the clemency which we bear toward all men, barely granting them their lives, and having surely known the heavenly God to have shielded the Jews, as
    **7** a Father ever warring for His sons; and having considered the steadfast goodwill which they bear toward us and our forefathers, we have justly released them, from whatsoever cause or accusation.
    **8** And we have further commanded each one that all return to their own [dwellings], in every place, no man in any wise harming them, nor reproaching them concerning those things which have unreasonably come to pass.
    **9** For know ye, that if against these we plot any evil thing, or grievously afflict them in any wise, not a man, but the Most High God, who is Lord of all power, we shall inevitably and continually have set against us for the avenging of these matters in every respect.
    **10** Fare ye well. But when they had received this epistle, they did not immediately make haste to depart, but rather entreated the king that those of the Jewish lineage who had wilfully transgressed against the holy God and the Law of God, might receive through them the
    **11** punishment which was due, alleging that such as for their own belly's sake had transgressed the divine commandments, would never be well-disposed even to the king's affairs.
    **12** But he, having assented and accepted that they spake the truth, gave them full liberty in all things, that they might utterly destroy those who had transgressed the Law of God throughout every place under his kingdom with boldness, without
    **13** any royal authority or oversight. Then, having blessed him with praises, as was fitting, the priests of these [Jews] and all the multitude,
    **14** having cried out 'Hallelujah,' departed with joy. Then, such as had fallen among the mixed [multitude of] their own countrymen, they did punish upon the road,
    **15** and with public examples of punishment did put them to death. And on that day they slew above three hundred men, and thereby kept a [day of] joy,
    **16** having vanquished the profane. But they themselves, who even unto death had held fast to God, having received a full enjoyment of salvation, departed from the city, adorned with all manner of most fragrant flowers,
