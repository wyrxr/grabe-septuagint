42 τες τὸν Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἀπέστειλε Δημήτριος πρὸς Ἰωνάθαν, λέγων· οὐ μόνον ταῦτα ποιήσω σοι καὶ τῷ ἔθνει σου, ἀλλὰ δόξῃ δοξάσω σε καὶ τὸ ἔθνος σου, ἐὰν εὐκαιρίας τύχω.
43 Νῦν οὖν ἄνδρας ποιήσεις ἀποστεῖλαί μοι ἄνδρας οἱ συμμαχήσουσι μοι, ὅτι ἀπέστησαν πᾶσαι αἱ δυνάμεις μου.
44 Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ἰωνάθαν ἄνδρας τρισχιλίους δυνατοὺς ἰσχύϊ αὐτῷ εἰς Ἀντιόχειαν, καὶ ἦλθοσαν πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα, καὶ ηὐφράνθη ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐπὶ τῇ ἐφόδῳ αὐτῶν.
45 Καὶ ἐπισυνήχθησαν οἱ ἐκ τῆς πόλεως εἰς μέσον τῆς πόλεως εἰς ἀνδρῶν δώδεκα μυριάδας, καὶ ἠβούλοντο ἀνελεῖν τὸν βασιλέα.
46 Καὶ ἔφυγεν ὁ βασιλεὺς εἰς τὴν αὐλὴν, καὶ κατελάβοντο οἱ ἐκ τῆς πόλεως τὰς ἐξόδους τῆς πόλεως, καὶ ἤρξαντο ἐκπολεμεῖν.
47 Καὶ ἐκάλεσεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τοὺς Ἰουδαίους ἐπὶ βοήθειαν, καὶ ἐπισυνήχθησαν πρὸς αὐτὸν πάντες ἅμα· καὶ διεσπάρησαν ἐν τῇ πόλει πάντες ἅμα· καὶ ἀπέκτειναν ἐν τῇ πόλει ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ εἰς μυριάδας δέκα.
48 Καὶ ἐνεπύρισαν τὴν πόλιν, καὶ ἐλάβοσαν σκῦλα πολλὰ ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ, καὶ ἔσωσαν τὸν βασιλέα.
49 Καὶ ἰδὸν οἱ ἀπὸ τῆς πόλεως ὅτι κατεκράτησαν οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι τῆς πόλεως ὡς ἠβούλοντο, καὶ ἠσθένουν ταῖς διανοίαις αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐκέκραξαν πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα μετὰ δεήσεως, λέγοντες.
50 Δὸς ἡμῖν δεξιᾶς, καὶ παυσάσθωσαν οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι πολεμοῦντες ἡμᾶς καὶ τὴν πόλιν.
51 Καὶ ἔριψαν τὰ ὅπλα, καὶ ἐποίησαν εἰρήνην, καὶ ἐδοξάσθησαν οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι ἐναντίον τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ ἐνώπιον πάντων τῶν ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἔχοντες σκῦλα πολλά.
52 Καὶ ἐκάθισεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Δημήτριος ἐπὶ θρόνου τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἡσύχασεν ἡ γῆ ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ.
53 Καὶ ἐψεύσατο πάντα ὅσα εἶπε, καὶ ἠλλοτριώθη τῷ Ἰωνάθαν, καὶ οὐκ ἀνταπέδωκε τὰς εὐνοίας ἃς ἀνταπέδωκεν αὐτῷ, καὶ ἔθλιψεν αὐτὸν σφόδρα.
54 Μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα ἀπέστρεψε Τρύφων καὶ Ἀντίοχος μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ παιδάριον νεώτερον· καὶ ἐβασίλευσε, καὶ ἐπέθετο διάδημα.
55 Καὶ ἐπισυνήχθησαν πρὸς αὐτὸν πᾶσαι αἱ δυνάμεις ἃς ἀπεσκοράκισε Δημήτριος, καὶ ἐπολέμησαν πρὸς αὐτὸν, καὶ ἔφυγε καὶ ἐτροπώθη.
56 Καὶ ἔλαβε Τρύφων τὰ θηρία, καὶ κατεκράτησεν Ἀντιοχείας.
57 Καὶ ἔγραφεν Ἀντίοχος ὁ νεώτερος Ἰωνάθᾳ, λέγων· ἵστημί σοι τὴν ἀρχιερωσύνην, καὶ καθίστημί σε ἐπὶ τῶν τεσσάρων νομῶν, καὶ εἶναί σε τῶν φίλων τοῦ βασιλέως.
58 Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν αὐτῷ χρυσώματα καὶ διακόσμησιν, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ.
