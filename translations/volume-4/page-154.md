τῶν Ἰουδαίων ἐξῆραι γένος· συνέστησε δὲ αὐτῷ καὶ Γοργίαν ἄν-
δρα στρατηγὸν καὶ ἐν πολεμικαῖς χρείαις ἔχοντα πεῖραν. Διεσή-
σατο δὲ ὁ Νικάνωρ τὸν φόρον τῷ βασιλεῖ τοῖς Ῥωμαίοις ἐντα-
ταλάντων δισχιλίων ἐκ τῆς τῶν Ἰουδαίων αἰχμαλωσίας ἐκπλη-
ρώσειν. Εὐθέως δὲ εἰς τὰς παραθαλασσίους πόλεις ἀπέστειλε
προσκαλούμενος ἐπ᾽ ἀγορασμὸν Ἰουδαϊκῶν σωμάτων, ὑπισχνού-
μενον ἐνενήκοντα σώματα ταλάντου παραχωρήσειν· οὐ προσδε-
χόμενος τὴν παρὰ τοῦ παντοκράτορος μέλλουσαν παρακολου-
θήσειν αὐτῷ δίκην. Τῷ δὲ Ἰούδᾳ προσέπεσε περὶ τῆς τοῦ
Νικάνωρος ἐφόδου˙ καὶ μεταδόντος αὐτοῦ τῆς σὺν αὐτῷ τὴν
παρουσίαν τοῦ στρατοπέδου, οἱ δειλανδροῦντες καὶ ἀπιστοῦντες
τὴν τοῦ Θεοῦ δίκην διεδίδρασκον (ἑαυτοὺς) καὶ ἐξετόπιζον ἑαυτούς.
Οἱ δὲ τὰ περιλελειμμένα πάντα ἐπώλουν, ἐμοῦ δὲ τὸν Κύριον
ᾔξιουν ξύσασθαι τοὺς ὑπὸ τοῦ δυσσεβοῦς Νικάνωρος πρὶν συντυ-
χεῖν πεπραμένους. Καὶ εἰ μὴ δί᾽ αὐτοὺς, ἀλλὰ διὰ τὰς πρὸς
τοὺς πατέρας αὐτῶν διαθήκας, καὶ ἕνεκα τῆς ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς ἐπικλή-
σεως τοῦ σεμνοῦ καὶ μεγαλοπρεποῦς ὀνόματος αὐτοῦ. Συναγα-
γὼν δὲ ὁ Μακκαβαῖος τοὺς περὶ αὐτὸν ὄντας τὸν ἀριθμὸν ἑξα-
κισχιλίους παρεκάλει μὴ καταπλαγῆναι τοὺς πολεμίους , μηδὲ
εὐλαβεῖσθαι τὴν τῶν ἀδίκως παραγινομένων ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς ἐθνῶν πο-
λυμηθίαν , ἀγωνίσασθαι δὲ γενναίως, πρὸ ὀφθαλμῶν λαβόντας
τὴν ἀνόμως εἰς τὸν ἅγιον τόπον συντετελεσμένην ὑπ᾽ αὐτῶν ὕ-
βριν, καὶ τὸν τῆς ἐμπεπαιγμένης πόλεως αἰκισμόν, ἔτι δὲ τὴν
τῆς προγονικῆς πολιτείας κατάλυσιν. Οἱ μὲν γὰρ ὅπλοις πεποί-
θασιν ἅμα καὶ τόλμαις, ἔφησεν, ἡμεῖς δὲ ἐπὶ τῷ παντοκράτορι
Θεῷ, δυναμένῳ καὶ τοὺς ἐρχομένους ἐφ᾽ ἡμᾶς, καὶ τὸν ὅλον κό-
σμον ἐν ἑνὶ νεύματι καταβαλεῖν πεποίθαμεν. Προσαναλεξάμε-

#### CHAPTER VIII.

**9** to utterly blot out the nation of the Jews. And he appointed also Gorgias with him, a captain, and one that had experience in matters of war. **10** Now Nicanor purposed to pay unto the king the tribute of two thousand talents due to the Romans, [to be raised] from the captivity of the Jews. **11** And straightway he sent unto the cities upon the sea-coast, inviting [men] to purchase Jewish bodies, promising to grant ninety bodies for a talent; **12** not considering the judgment from the Almighty which was soon to follow him.

**13** But tidings came unto Judas concerning Nicanor's approach; and when he had imparted unto them that were with him the presence of the army, those that were faint-hearted and disbelieving the judgment of God fled [themselves] and exiled themselves. **14** And the rest sold all that they had left. But I prayed the Lord to wipe out those who had been sold by the impious Nicanor ere they could encounter [him]; **15** and if not for their sakes, yet for the sake of the covenants [made] with their fathers, and for the sake of the invocation of His venerable and magnificent Name upon them.

**16** Then Maccabaeus gathered together those that were with him, in number six thousand, and exhorted them not to be dismayed by the enemies, nor to fear the great cunning of the nations that were coming unjustly against them, **17** but to fight bravely, having before their eyes the lawless outrage perpetrated by them against the holy place, and the torment of the city that had been scorned, and furthermore, the dissolution of their ancestral constitution. **18** "For they indeed trust in arms and in boldness," he said, "but we trust in the Almighty God, Who is able to cast down both those who come against us and the whole world with a single nod."

**19** And recounting unto them the assistances that had come to their forefathers, and how, in the time of Sennacherib, one hundred eighty-five thousand were destroyed, **20** and the battle that took place in Babylonia against the Galatians, how that all who came unto the service were eight thousand, with four thousand Macedonians, and when the Macedonians were at a loss, the six thousand destroyed twelve myriads through the help that came to them from heaven, and they received much profit. **21** By these things, having made them courageous and ready to die for the laws and for their homeland, he divided the army into four parts.
