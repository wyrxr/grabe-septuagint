μυρίων πρὸς τοῖς δισχιλίοις, προστάξας τοὺς ἐν ἡλικίᾳ πάντας
κατασφάξαι, τὰς δὲ γυναῖκας καὶ τοὺς νεωτέρους πωλεῖν. **25** Οὗ-
τος δὲ παραγενόμενος εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα, καὶ τὸν εἰρηνικὸν ὑποκρι-
θείς, ἐπέσχεν ἕως τῆς ἁγίας ἡμέρας τοῦ σαββάτου· καὶ λαβὼν
ἀργοῦντας τοὺς Ἰουδαίους τοῖς ὑφ᾽ ἑαυτὸν ἐξοπλισίαν παρήγ-
γειλε. **26** Καὶ τοὺς ἐλθόντας πάντας ἐπὶ τὴν θεωρίαν συνεχέντησε,
καὶ εἰς τὴν πόλιν σὺν τοῖς ὁπλίταις εἰσδραμὼν ἱκανά κατέ-
στρωσε πλήθη. **27** Ἰούδας δὲ ὁ καὶ Μακκαβαῖος δέκατος που γε-

τούμενοι διετέλουν, πρὸς τὸ μὴ μετασχεῖν τοῦ μολυσμοῦ.

ΜΕΤ᾽ οὐ πολὺν δὲ χρόνον ἐξαπέστειλεν ὁ βασιλεὺς γέροντα **1**
Ἀθηναῖον, ἀναγκάζειν τοὺς Ἰουδαίους μεταβαίνειν ἀπὸ τῶν πα-
τρίων νόμων, καὶ τοῖς τοῦ Θεοῦ νόμοις μὴ πολιτεύεσθαι. **2** Μο-
λῦναι δὲ καὶ τὸν ἐν Ἱεροσολύμοις νεών, καὶ προσονομάσαι Διὸς
Ὀλυμπίου, καὶ τὸν ἐν Γαριζείν, καθώς ἐτύγχανον οἱ τὸν τόπον
οἰκοῦντες, Διὸς ξενίου. **3** Χαλεπὴ δὲ καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις ἦν δυσχε-
ρὴς ἡ ἐπίστασις τῆς κακίας. **4** Τὸ μὲν γὰρ ἱερὸν ἀσωτίας καὶ κώ-
μων ὑπὸ τῶν ἐθνῶν ἐπεπληροῦτο ῥαθυμούντων μεθ᾽ ἑταιρῶν, καὶ
ἐν τοῖς ἱεροῖς περιβόλοις γυναιξὶ πλασιαζόντων, ἔτι δὲ τὰ μὴ
καθήκοντα ἔνδον εἰσφερόντων. **5** Τὸ δὲ θυσιαστήριον τοῖς ἀποδιε-
σταλμένοις ἀπὸ τῶν νόμων ἀθεμίτοις ἐπεπληροῦτο. **6** Ἦν δ᾽ οὔτε
σαββατίζειν, οὔτε πατρῴους ἑορτὰς διαφυλάττειν, οὔτε ἁπλῶς
Ἰουδαῖον ὁμολογεῖν εἶναι. **7** Ἤγοντο δὲ μετὰ πικρᾶς ἀνάγκης
εἰς τὴν κατὰ μῆνα τοῦ βασιλέως γενέθλιον ἡμέραν ἐπὶ σπλαγ-
χνισμὸν· γενομένης δὲ Διονυσίων ἑορτῆς ἠναγκάζοντο κισσοὺς ἔ-
χοντες πομπεύειν τῷ Διονύσῳ. **8** Ψήφισμα δὲ ἐξέπεσεν εἰς τὰς
ἀστυγείτονας Ἑλληνίδας πόλεις, Πτολεμαίου ὑποθεμένου τὴν αὐ-

#### CHAPTER V.

...[of] twenty-two thousand [men], commanding that all those of full age should be slaughtered, and the women and the younger folk sold [into bondage].
**25** Now when this man came unto Jerusalem, and feigning [a disposition of] peace, he did abide until the holy Sabbath day; and finding the Jews at rest, he commanded his men that were under him to arm themselves [for battle].
**26** And all those that had come forth to behold [the spectacle] did he stab with a continuous thrust; and rushing into the city with his armed men, he laid low many multitudes.
**27** But Judas, who was also called Maccabaeus, being, as it were, one of ten [men], withdrew into the wilderness among the mountains; and there, like unto wild beasts, did he live with those that were with him. And they continued to sustain themselves with herbs and grassy food, that they might not partake of the defilement [of the Gentile ways].

#### CHAPTER VI.

And not long after this, the king sent forth an Athenian elder, to compel the Jews to abandon the laws of their fathers, and no longer to live according to the laws of God.
**2** And furthermore, to defile the Temple in Jerusalem, and to name it after Olympian Zeus; and that upon Mount Gerizim, even as was customary for those dwelling in that place, after Zeus Xenios.
**3** Now grievous and difficult for all others was this incursion of wickedness [from the king].
**4** For the Temple was filled by the Gentiles with wantonness and with revelings, who lived dissolutely with harlots, and consorted with women within the sacred precincts; and, moreover, they brought in within [its holy walls] such things as were not lawful.
**5** And the altar was filled with unlawful things, [even] abominations, which were forbidden by the Law.
**6** And it was no longer lawful to keep the Sabbath, nor to observe the feasts of their fathers, nor, in brief, to confess oneself to be a Jew.
**7** And they were led forth with bitter compulsion unto the king's monthly birthday feast, to partake of sacrificial meats; and when the feast of Dionysus came, they were constrained to walk in procession, bearing ivy [wreaths], unto Dionysus.
**8** Moreover, a decree went forth unto the neighboring Greek cities, Ptolemy having proposed that they should enforce the same policy against the Jews: [namely,] to offer sacrifice;
**9** And that whosoever would not choose to adopt the Hellenic customs should be put to the sword.
**10** Thus, it was manifest to behold the present affliction. For two women were brought forth who had circumcised their children; and hanging their infants from their breasts, they led them publicly about the city, and then cast them down from the top of the wall.
