**48** τῇ ἄνδρας οἵ τινες τὸν νόμον ποιοῦσι, καὶ προσωχύρωσεν αὐτὴν, καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν ἑαυτῷ ἐν αὐτῇ εἴρκην.
**49** Οἱ δὲ ἐκ τῆς ἄκρας ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐκωλύοντο ἐκπορεύεσθαι καὶ εἰσπορεύεσθαι εἰς τὴν χώραν, καὶ ἀγοράζειν καὶ πωλεῖν, καὶ ἐπείνασαν σφόδρα, καὶ ἀπώλοντο ἐξ αὐτῶν ἱκανοὶ τῷ λιμῷ.
**50** Καὶ ἐβόησαν πρὸς Σίμωνα δεξιᾶς λαβεῖν, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἐξέβαλεν αὐτοὺς ἐκεῖθεν, καὶ ἐκαθάρισε τὴν ἄκραν ἀπὸ τῶν μιασμάτων.
**51** Καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς αὐτὴν τῇ τρίτῃ καὶ εἰκάδι τοῦ δευτέρου μηνὸς ἔτους ἑνὸς καὶ ἑβδομηκοστοῦ καὶ ἑκατοστοῦ μετὰ αἰνέσεως καὶ βαΐων καὶ ἐν κινύραις καὶ ἐν κυμβάλοις καὶ ἐν νάβλαις καὶ ἐν ὕμνοις καὶ ἐν ᾠδαῖς, ὅτι συνετρίβη ἐχθρὸς μέγας ἐξ Ἰσραήλ.

**1** Καὶ ἐν ἔτει δευτέρῳ, καὶ ἑβδομηκοστῷ, καὶ ἑκατοστῷ συνήγαγε Δημήτριος ὁ βασιλεὺς τὰς δυνάμεις αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπορεύθη εἰς Μηδίαν, τοῦ ἐπισπάσθαι βοήθειαν ἑαυτῷ, ὅπως πολεμήσῃ τὸν Τρύφωνα.
**2** Καὶ ἤκουσεν Ἀρσάκης ὁ βασιλεὺς τῆς Περσίδος καὶ Μηδίας, ὅτι ἦλθε Δημήτριος εἰς τὰ ὅρια αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ἕνα τῶν ἀρχόντων αὐτοῦ συλλαβεῖν αὐτὸν ζῶντα.
**3** Καὶ ἐπορεύθη, καὶ ἐπάταξε τὴν παρεμβολὴν Δημητρίου, καὶ συνέλαβεν αὐτὸν, καὶ ἤγαγεν αὐτὸν πρὸς Ἀρσάκην, καὶ ἔθετο αὐτὸν ἐν φυλακῇ.

**6** Καὶ ἐπλάτυνε τὰ ὅρια τῷ ἔθνει αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐκράτησε τῆς χώρας.
**7** Καὶ συνήγαγεν αἰχμαλωσίαν πολλὴν, καὶ ἐκυρίευσε Γαζάρων καὶ Βεθσούρων καὶ τῆς ἄκρας· καὶ ἐξῆρε τὰς ἀκαθαρσίας ἐξ αὐτῆς, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ ἀντικείμενος αὐτῷ.
**8** Καὶ ἦσαν γεωργοῦντες τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν μετ᾿ εἰρήνης, καὶ
**9** ἡ γῆ ἐδίδου τὰ γεννήματα αὐτῆς, καὶ τὰ ξύλα τῶν πεδίων τὸν καρπὸν αὐτῶν. Πρεσβύτεροι ἐν ταῖς πλατείαις ἐκάθηντο, πάντες περὶ ἀγαθῶν ἐκοινολόγουν, καὶ οἱ νεανίσκοι ἐνεδύσαντο δόξας καὶ στολὰς πολέμου.
**10** Ταῖς πόλεσιν ἐχορήγησε βρώματα, καὶ ἔταξεν αὐτὰς ἐν σκεύεσιν ὀχυρώσεως, ἕως ὅτου ὠνομάσθη τὸ ὄνομα τῆς δόξης αὐτοῦ ἕως ἄκρου τῆς γῆς.
**11** Ἐποίησε τὴν εἰρήνην ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, καὶ ηὐφράνθη Ἰσραὴλ εὐφροσύνην μεγάλην.
**12** Καὶ ἐκάθισεν ἕκαστος ὑπὸ τὴν ἄμπελον αὐτοῦ καὶ τὴν συκῆν αὑτοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ ἐκφοβῶν αὐτούς.
**13** Καὶ ἐξέλειπε πολεμῶν αὑτοὺς ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, καὶ οἱ βασιλεῖς αὐτῶν συνετρίβησαν ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις.
**14** Καὶ ἐστήρισε πάντας τοὺς ταπεινοὺς τοῦ λαοῦ αὑτοῦ· τὸν νόμον ἐξεζήτησε, καὶ ἐξῆρε πάντα ἄνομον καὶ πονηρόν.
**15** Τὰ ἅγια ἐδόξασε, καὶ ἐπλήθυνε τὰ σκεύη τῶν ἁγίων.
**16** Καὶ ἠκούσθη ἐν Ῥώμῃ, ὅτι ἀπέθανεν Ἰωναθαν, καὶ ἕως Σπάρτης, καὶ ἐλυπήθησαν σφόδρα.
**17** Ὡς δὲ ἤκουσαν, ὅτι Σίμων ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὑτοῦ γέγονεν ἀντ᾿ αὑτοῦ ἀρχιερεύς, καὶ ἐπικρατεῖ τῆς χώρας καὶ τῶν πόλεων τῶν ἐν αὐτῇ.
**18** Καὶ ἔγραψαν πρὸς αὐτὸν δέλτοις χαλκαῖς τοῦ ἀνανεώσασθαι πρὸς αὐτὸν φιλίαν καὶ τὴν συμμαχίαν, ἣν ἔστησαν πρὸς Ἰούδαν καὶ Ἰωναθαν τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὑτοῦ.
**19** Καὶ ἀνεγνώσθησαν ἐνώπιον ἐκκλησίας ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ.
**20** Καὶ τοῦτο τὸ ἀντίγραφον τῶν ἐπιστολῶν ὧν ἀπέστειλαν οἱ Σπαρτιᾶται· Σπαρτιατῶν ἄρχοντες καὶ ἡ πόλις Σίμωνι ἱερεῖ μεγάλῳ καὶ τοῖς πρεσβυτέροις καὶ τοῖς ἱερεῦσι καὶ τῷ λοιπῷ δήμῳ τῶν Ἰουδαίων ἀδελφοῖς χαίρειν.
**21** Οἱ πρεσβευταὶ οἱ ἀποσταλέντες πρὸς τὸν δῆμον ἡμῶν ἀπήγγειλαν ἡμῖν περὶ τῆς δόξης ὑμῶν καὶ τιμῆς, καὶ ηὐφράνθημεν ἐπὶ τῇ ἐφόδῳ αὐτῶν.
**22** Καὶ ἀνεγράψαμεν τὰ ὑπ᾿ αὐτῶν εἰρημένα ἐν ταῖς βουλαῖς τοῦ δήμου οὕτως· Νουμήνιος Ἀντιόχου καὶ Ἀντίπατρος Ἰάσωνος πρεσβευταὶ Ἰουδαίων ἦλθοσαν πρὸς ἡμᾶς ἀνανεούμενοι τὴν πρὸς ἡμᾶς φιλίαν.
**23** Καὶ ἤρεσε τῷ δήμῳ ἐπιδέξασθαι τοὺς ἄνδρας ἐνδόξως, καὶ τοῦ θέσθαι τὸ ἀντίγραφον τῶν λόγων αὐτῶν ἐν τοῖς ἀποδεδειγμένοις τοῦ δήμου βιβλίοις τοῦ μνημόσυνον ἔχειν τὸν δῆμον τῶν Σπαρτιατῶν· τὸ δὲ ἀντίγραφον τούτων ἔγραψαν Σίμωνι τῷ ἀρχιερεῖ.
**24** Μετὰ ταῦτα ἀπέστειλε Σίμων τὸν Νουμήνιον εἰς Ῥώμην ἔχοντα ἀσπίδα χρυσῆν μεγάλην ἔλκον χιλίας μνᾶς εἰς τὸ στῆσαι πρὸς αὐτοὺς τὴν συμμαχίαν.
**25** Ὡς δὲ ἤκουσεν ὁ δῆμος
