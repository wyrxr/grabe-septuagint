**26** Ἀλλὰ τούτων οὐδὲν εἶπον οἱ νεανίαι βασανίζεσθαι μέλλοντες, οὐδὲ ἐνεθυμήθησαν.
**27** Ἦσαν γὰρ περίφρονες τῶν παθῶν, καὶ αὐτοκράτορες τῶν ἀλγηδόνων.
**28** Ὥστε ἅμα τῷ παύσασθαι τὸν τύραννον συμβουλεύοντα αὐτοῖς τοῦ μαλακισθῆναι,
**29** πάντες διὰ μιᾶς φωνῆς ὁμοῦ, ὥσπερ ἀπὸ τῆς αὐτῆς ψυχῆς εἶπον πρὸς αὐτόν.

**ΚΕΦ. Θ´. ΙΧ.**

**1** Τί μέλλεις, ὦ τύραννε; ἕτοιμοι γὰρ ἐσμεν ἀποθνήσκειν ἢ παραβαίνειν τὰς πατρίους ἡμῶν ἐντολάς.
**2** Καὶ αἰσχυνόμεθα γὰρ τοὺς προγόνους εἰκότως, εἰ μὴ τῇ τοῦ νόμου εὐπειθείᾳ καὶ συμβούλῳ Μωσῆ χρησαίμεθα·
**3** μὴ σύμβουλε τύραννε παρανομίας, μὴ ἡμᾶς μισῶν ὑπὲρ αὐτοὺς ἡμᾶς ἐλέα.
**4** Χαλεπώτερον γὰρ αὐτοῦ τοῦ θανάτου νομίζομεν εἶναί σου τὸν ἐπὶ τῇ παρανόμῳ σωτηρίᾳ ἡμῶν ἔλεον.
**5** Ἠκρόασω δὲ ἡμᾶς, τὸν διὰ τῶν βασάνων ἡμῖν θάνατον ἀπειλῶν, ὥσπερ οὐχὶ πρὸ βραχέος παρὰ Ἐλεαζάρου μαθών.
**6** Εἰ δ’ οἱ γέροντες τῶν Ἑβραίων διὰ τὴν εὐσέβειαν καὶ βασανισμοὺς ὑπομείναντες εὐσέβησαν, ἀποθάνοιμεν
**7** ἂν δικαιότερον ἡμεῖς οἱ νέοι, τὰς βασάνους τῶν σῶν ἀναγκῶν ὑπερδόντες, ἃς καὶ ὁ παιδευτὴς ἡμῶν γέρων ἐνίκησεν.
**8** Πείραζε γαροῦν τύραννε· καὶ τὰς ἡμῶν ψυχὰς εἰ θανατώσεις διὰ τὴν εὐσέβειαν, μὴ νομίσῃς ἡμᾶς βλαπτεῖν βασανίζων.
**9** Ἡμεῖς μὲν γὰρ διὰ τῆσδε τῆς κακοπαθείας καὶ ὑπομονῆς, τὰ τῆς ἀρετῆς ἆθλα οἴσομεν, καὶ ἐσόμεθα παρὰ Θεῷ, δι᾽ ὃν καὶ πάσχομεν·
**10** σὺ δὲ διὰ τὴν ἡμῶν μισοφονίαν αὐτάρκη καρτερήσεις περὶ τῆς θείας δίκης αἰώνιον βάσανον διὰ πυρός.
**11** Ταῦτα αὐτῶν εἰπόντων, οὐ μόνον ὡς κατὰ ἀπειθούντων ἐχαλέππαινεν ὁ τύραννος, ἀλλ᾽ ὡς καὶ κατὰ ἀχρίστων ὠργίσθη.
**12** Ὅθεν κελευσθέντες παρήγαγον οἱ ὑπασπισταὶ τὸν πρεσβύτατον αὐτῶν, καὶ διαρρήξαντες τὸν χιτῶνα διέδησαν τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ καὶ τοὺς βραχίονας ἱμᾶσιν ἑκατέρωθεν.
**13** Εἷς δὲ τύπτοντες ταῖς μάστιξιν ἐκοπίασαν, μηδὲν ἀνύοντες, ἀνέβαλον αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὸν τροχόν.
**14** Περὶ ὃν κατατεινόμενος ὁ εὐγενὴς νεανίας, ἔξαρθρος ἐγένετο.
**15** Καὶ κατὰ πᾶν μέλος κλώμενος ἐκατηγόρει, λέγων· Τύραννε μιαρώτατε, καὶ τῆς οὐρανίου δίκης ἐχθρέ, καὶ ὠμόφρον,
**16** οὐκ ἀνδροφονήσαντά με τοῦτον καταικίζεις τὸν τρόπον, οὐδὲ ἀσεβήσαντα, ἀλλὰ θείου νόμου προασπίζοντα.

**CHAPTER VIII.**

**26** But of these things spake the young men, who were about to be tortured, nought; neither did they ponder them in their hearts.
**27** For they were contemptuous of passions, and held sovereign sway over pains.
**28** So, when the tyrant had ceased counselling them that they should become soft,
**29** all of them together, with one voice, as if from one and the same soul, did speak unto him:

**CHAPTER IX.**

**1** "Why dost thou delay, O tyrant? For we are ready to die, rather than to transgress the ancestral commandments that are ours.
**2** And we are rightly ashamed of our forefathers, if we should not make use of the obedience to the Law and of Moses as our counselor.
**3** Counsel us not, O tyrant, unto lawlessness; neither, hating us, do thou pity us beyond ourselves.
**4** For we do hold thy pity for our unlawful salvation to be more grievous than death itself.
**5** Thou dost threaten us with death through tortures, as if thou hadst not learned [aught] from Eleazar but a short while ago.
**6** But if the elders of the Hebrews, having endured tortures for piety, did yet show piety,
**7** then we, the younger, should more justly die, overcoming the tortures of thy compulsions, which even our aged teacher did conquer.
**8** Therefore, test us, O tyrant; and if thou shalt put our souls to death for piety, do not suppose that thou dost harm us by torturing.
**9** For we, through this suffering and endurance, shall bear the prizes of virtue, and we shall be with God, for Whom also we suffer;
**10** but thou, because of our hatred of murder [of the soul], shalt by thyself endure, concerning divine justice, an eternal torment by fire."

**11** When they had spoken these things, the tyrant raged not only as against disobedient ones, but also as against unhallowed ones.
**12** Wherefore, having been commanded, the guards led forth the eldest of them, and rending his tunic, they bound his hands and his arms on both sides with thongs.
**13** And when one [of them] had wearied himself by beating with whips, accomplishing nought, they threw him upon the wheel.
**14** And the noble young man, stretched upon it, became dislocated in his joints.
**15** And being broken in every limb, he did accuse [the tyrant], saying: "O most defiled tyrant, and enemy of heavenly justice, and cruel-minded one,
**16** thou dost torture me in this manner not as one who hath committed murder, nor as one who hath been impious, but as one defending divine law."
