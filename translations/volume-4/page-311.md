19 τῆς ἐκστήσεται καρδία. Καὶ πάχνην ὡς ἅλα ἐπὶ γῆς χέει, καὶ
20 παγεῖσα γίνεται ὡς σκολόπων ἄκρα. Ψυχρὸς ἄνεμος βορέας
    πνεύσει, καὶ παγήσεται κρύσταλλος ἐφ᾽ ὕδατος· ἐπὶ πᾶσαν συνα-
    γωγὴν ὕδατος καταλύσει, καὶ ὡς θώρακα ἐνδύσεται τὸ ὕδωρ.
21 Καταράγεται ὄρη, καὶ ἔρημον ἐκκαύσει, καὶ ἀποσβέσει χλόην
22 ὡς πῦρ. Ἴασις πάντων κατὰ σπουδὴν, ὁμίχλη· δρόσος ἀπαντῶσα
23 ἀπὸ καύσωνος ἱλαρώσει. Λογισμῷ αὐτοῦ ἐκόπασεν ἄβυσσον, καὶ
24 ἐφύτευσεν ἐν αὐτῇ νήσους. Οἱ πλέοντες τὴν θάλασσαν διηγοῦνται
25 κίνδυνον αὐτῆς, καὶ ἀκοαῖς ὠτίων ἡμῶν θαυμάζομεν. Καὶ ἐκεῖ
    τὰ θαυμάσια καὶ παράδοξα ἔργα, ποικιλία παντὸς ζώου, κτίσις
26 κητῶν· δι᾽ αὐτὸν εὐοδεῖ ἄγγελος αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐν λόγῳ αὐτοῦ σύγ-
27 κειται τὰ πάντα. Πολλὰ ἐροῦμεν, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἀφικώμεθα, καὶ
28 συντέλεια λόγων τὸ πᾶν ἐστιν αὐτός. Δοξάζοντες ποῦ ἰσχύσο-
29 μεν; αὐτὸς γὰρ ὁ μέγας παρὰ πάντα τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ· φοβερὸς
30 Κύριος καὶ σφόδρα μέγας, καὶ θαυμαστὴ ἡ δυναστεία αὐτοῦ. Δο-
    ξάζοντες Κύριον ὑψώσατε, καθόσον ἂν δύνησθε, (ὑπερέξει γὰρ
    καὶ ἔτι) καὶ ὑψοῦντες αὐτὸν πληθύνατε ἐν ἰσχύι· μὴ κοπιάτε, οὐ
31 γὰρ μὴ ἀφίκησθε. Τίς ἑώρακεν αὐτὸν καὶ ἐκδιηγήσεται ; καὶ τίς
32 μεγαλυνεῖ αὐτὸν καθὼς ἐστὶ ; Πολλὰ ἀπόκρυφα ἐστὶ μείζονα
33 τούτων· ὀλίγα γὰρ ἑωράκαμεν τῶν ἔργων αὐτοῦ. Πάντα γὰρ
    ἐποίησεν ὁ Κύριος, καὶ τοῖς εὐσεβέσι δέδωκε σοφίαν.

19 ...[the beauty of its whiteness shall astonish the eye,]
And even at its rain, the heart shall be amazed.
20 And hoarfrost as salt upon the earth it poureth;
And being frozen, it becometh as the points of thorns.
A cold wind, Boreas, shall blow forth,
And crystal shall be frozen upon the water;
Upon every gathering of water it shall settle,
And as a breastplate shall the water clothe itself.
21 Mountains shall be shattered,
And the wilderness shall it burn up,
And it shall consume the grass as fire.
22 A swift healing for all things is the mist;
And the dew, coming after the heat, shall bring forth gladness.
23 By His thought He hath calmed the abyss,
And in it hath He planted islands.
24 They that sail the sea do tell of its danger,
And by the hearing of our ears are we amazed.
25 And there are His wondrous and paradoxical works,
The variety of every living creature,
The creation of the great sea-monsters;
26 For His sake doth His messenger prosper,
And by His word are all things held together.
27 Much shall we say, yet shall we not reach [unto Him];
And the sum of all words, the whole, is He Himself.
28 Glorifying Him, wherewith shall we be strong [enough]?
29 For He Himself is great beyond all His works.
Fearsome is the Lord and exceeding great,
And wondrous is His dominion.
30 Glorifying the Lord, exalt ye Him,
As much as ye are able; (for He shall yet exceed [it])
And exalting Him, multiply [your praises] with might.
Faint not, for ye shall surely not reach [unto Him].
31 Who hath seen Him and shall declare [it]?
And who shall magnify Him as He is?
32 Many hidden things there be, greater than these;
33 For but few of His works have we seen.
For the Lord hath made all things,
And to the pious hath He given wisdom.

**Chapter Forty-Four**

**A Hymn of the Fathers.**

1 Let us now praise famous men,
And our fathers in their generations.
2 The Lord hath created great glory in them
3 By His greatness from the age of ages.
They were rulers in their kingdoms,
And men renowned in power,
Counsellors in their understanding,
Having proclaimed [the truth] in prophecies.
4 Leaders of the people in deliberations,
And in the understanding of the writings of the people,
Wise in words by their instruction.
5 They sought out musical melodies,
And recounted epics in writing.
6 Rich men, furnished with strength,
Dwelling peacefully in their habitations.
7 All these were glorified in their generations,
And in their days were a boast.
8 There be of them, who left a name...
