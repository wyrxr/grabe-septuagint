σμὸν εἰς παρασκευὴν πολέμου, ὅτι προσφάτως ἦν τὰ πεδία αὐ-
τῶν τεθερισμένα. Καὶ ἔγραφεν Ἰωακεὶμ ὁ ἱερεὺς ὁ μέγας, ὃς ἦν 6
ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ, τοῖς κατοικοῦσι Βετυ-
λούᾳ, καὶ Βετομεσθαὶμ, ἣ ἐστιν ἀπέναντι Ἐσδρηλὼν, κατὰ πρό-
σωπον τοῦ πεδίου τοῦ πλησίον Δωθαΐμ, λέγων· διακατασχεῖν 7
τὰς ἀναβάσεις τῆς ὀρεινῆς, ὅτι δι᾽ αὐτῶν ἦν ἡ εἴσοδος εἰς τὴν
Ἰουδαίαν. Καὶ ἦν εὐχερῶς διακωλῦσαι αὐτοὺς προσβαίνοντας, στε-
νῆς τῆς διαβάσεως οὔσης, ἐπ᾽ ἄνδρας τοὺς πάντας δύο. Καὶ ἐ- 8
ποίησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ καθὰ συνέταξεν αὐτοῖς Ἰωακεὶμ ὁ ἱε-
ρεὺς ὁ μέγας, καὶ ἡ γερουσία παντὸς λαοῦ Ἰσραὴλ, οἳ ἐκάθηντο
ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ ἀνεβόησαν πᾶς ἀνὴρ Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς τὸν Θεὸν 9
ἐν ἐκτενίᾳ μεγάλῃ, καὶ ἐταπείνωσαν τὰς ψυχὰς αὑτῶν ἐν ἐκτενίᾳ
μεγάλῃ, αὐτοὶ, καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰ νήπια αὐτῶν, 10
καὶ τὰ κτήνη αὐτῶν, καὶ πᾶς πάροικος, καὶ μισθωτὸς, καὶ ἀρ-
γυρώνητος αὐτῶν, ἐπέθεντο σάκκους ἐπὶ τὰς ὀσφύας αὑτῶν.
Καὶ πᾶς ἀνὴρ Ἰσραὴλ καὶ γυνὴ, καὶ τὰ παιδία, καὶ οἱ κατοι- 11
κοῦντες ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ ἔπεσον κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ ναοῦ, καὶ
ἐσποδωσάντο τὰς κεφαλὰς αὑτῶν, καὶ ἐξέτειναν τοὺς σάκκους
αὑτῶν κατὰ πρόσωπον Κυρίου. Καὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον σάκκῳ πε- 12
ριέβαλον, καὶ ἐβόησαν πρὸς τὸν Θεὸν Ἰσραὴλ ὁμοθυμαδὸν ἐκτε-
νῶς, τοῦ μὴ δοῦναι εἰς διαρπαγὴν τὰ νήπια αὑτῶν, καὶ τὰς
γυναῖκας εἰς προνομὴν, καὶ τὰς πόλεις τῆς κληρονομίας αὑτῶν
εἰς ἀφανισμὸν, καὶ τὰ ἅγια εἰς βεβήλωσιν καὶ ὀνειδισμὸν, ἐπί-
χαρμα τοῖς ἔθνεσι. Καὶ εἰσήκουσε Κύριος τῆς φωνῆς αὑτῶν, 13
καὶ εἶσεῖδε τὴν θλίψιν αὑτῶν· καὶ ἦν ὁ λαὸς νηστεύων ἡμέρας
πλείους ἐν πάσῃ τῇ Ἰουδαίᾳ καὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ, κατὰ πρόσωπον
τῶν ἁγίων Κυρίου τοῦ παντοκράτορος. Καὶ Ἰωακεὶμ ὁ ἱερεὺς 14
ὁ μέγας, καὶ πάντες οἱ παρεστηκότες ἐνώπιον Κυρίου, ἱερεῖς οἱ
λειτουργοῦντες Κυρίῳ, σάκκους περιεζωσμένοι τὰς ὀσφύας αὑτῶν,
προσέφερον τὴν ὁλοκαύτωσιν τοῦ ἐνδελεχισμοῦ, καὶ τὰς εὐχὰς,
καὶ τὰ ἑκούσια δόματα τοῦ λαοῦ. Καὶ ἦν σποδὸς ἐπὶ τὰς κιδά- 15
ρεις αὑτῶν· καὶ ἐδέων πρὸς Κύριον ἐκ πάσης δυνάμεως εἰς ἀ-
γαθὸν, ἐπισκέψασθαι πάντα οἶκον Ἰσραὴλ.

1 ΚΑΙ ἀνηγγέλη Ὀλοφέρνῃ ἀρχιστρατήγῳ δυνάμεως Ἀσσοὺρ,
   διότι υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ παρεσκευάσαντο εἰς πόλεμον, καὶ τὰς διόδους
   τῆς ὀρεινῆς συνέκλεισαν, καὶ ἐτείχισαν πᾶσαν κορυφὴν ὄρους
2 ὑψηλοῦ, καὶ ἔθηκαν ἐν τοῖς πεδίοις σκάνδαλα. Καὶ ὠργίσθη θυμῷ
   σφόδρα, καὶ ἐκάλεσε πάντας τοὺς ἄρχοντας Μωάβ, καὶ τοὺς
   στρατηγοὺς υἱοὺς Ἀμμὼν, καὶ πάντας σατράπας τῆς παραλίας,
3 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· ἀναγγείλατε δὴ μοι, υἱοὶ Χαναὰν, τίς ὁ λαὸς
   οὗτος ὁ καθήμενος ἐν τῇ ὀρεινῇ, καὶ τίνες ἃς κατοικοῦσι πόλεις,
   καὶ τὸ πλῆθος τῆς δυνάμεως αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐν τίνι τὸ κράτος αὐτῶν,
   καὶ ἡ ἰσχὺς αὐτῶν, καὶ τίς ἀνέστηκεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτῶν ὁ βασιλεὺς
4 ἡγούμενος στρατείας αὐτῶν; Καὶ διὰ τί κατενωτίσαντο τοῦ μὴ
   ἐλθεῖν εἰς ἀπάντησίν μοι παρὰ πάντας τοὺς κατοικοῦντας ἐν
5 δυσμαῖς; Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτὸν Ἀχιὼρ ὁ ἡγούμενος πάντων υἱῶν
   Ἀμμὼν· ἀκουσάτω δὴ λόγον ὁ κύριός μου ἐκ στόματος τοῦ δού-
   λου σου, καὶ ἀναγγελῶ σοι τὴν ἀλήθειαν περὶ τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου,
   ὅς κατοικεῖ τὴν ὀρεινὴν ταύτην, πλησίον σου οἰκοῦντος, καὶ οὐκ
6 ἐξελεύσεται ψεῦδος ἐκ τοῦ στόματος τοῦ δούλου σου. Ὁ λαὸς
7 οὗτος εἰσὶν ἀπόγονοι Χαλδαίων, καὶ παρῴκησαν τὸ πρότερον ἐν
   τῇ Μεσοποταμίᾳ, ὅτι οὐκ ἐβουλήθησαν ἀκολουθῆσαι τοῖς θεοῖς
8 τῶν πατέρων αὐτῶν, οἱ ἐγένοντο ἐν γῇ Χαλδαίων· καὶ ἐξέβησαν ἐξ
   ὁδοῦ τῶν γονέων αὐτῶν, καὶ προσεκύνησαν τῷ Θεῷ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ,
   Θεῷ ᾧ ἐπέγνωσαν· καὶ ἐξέβαλον αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ προσώπου τῶν θεῶν
   αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔφυγον εἰς Μεσοποταμίαν, καὶ παρῴκησαν ἐκεῖ ἡ-
9 μέρας πολλὰς. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ Θεὸς αὐτῶν ἐξελθεῖν ἐκ τῆς παροι-
   κίας αὐτῶν, καὶ πορευθῆναι εἰς γῆν Χαναὰν· καὶ κατῴκησαν
   ἐκεῖ, καὶ ἐπληθύνθησαν χρυσίῳ καὶ ἀργυρίῳ καὶ ἐν κτήνεσι πολ-
10 λοῖς σφόδρα· καὶ κατέβησαν εἰς Αἴγυπτον, ἐκάλυψε γὰρ τὸ πρό-
   σωπον τῆς γῆς Χαναὰν λιμὸς, καὶ παρῴκησαν ἐκεῖ μέχρις οὗ
   διετράφησαν· καὶ ἐγένοντο ἐκεῖ εἰς πλῆθος πολὺ, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἀ-
11 ριθμὸς τοῦ γένους αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐπανέστη αὐτοῖς ὁ βασιλεὺς
   Αἰγύπτου, καὶ κατεσοφίσατο αὐτοὺς, καὶ ἐν πόνῳ καὶ πλίνθῳ
12 ταπείνωσεν αὐτοὺς, καὶ ἔθετο αὐτοὺς εἰς δούλους. Καὶ ἀνεβόη-
   σαν πρὸς τὸν Θεὸν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπάταξε πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν Αἰγύ-
   πτου πληγαῖς, ἐν αἷς οὐκ ἦν ἴασις· καὶ ἐξέβαλον αὐτοὺς οἱ

#### CHAPTER 4

5 provisions for the preparing of war, for their fields had but lately been harvested.
6 And Joakim the High Priest, who in those days was in Jerusalem, wrote unto them that dwelt in Bethulia and Betomesthaim, which lieth over against Esdraelon, hard by the plain of Dotaim, saying:
7 "That they should hold fast the ascents of the hill country, for by them was the entrance into Judea. And it was easy to hinder them as they approached, for the pass was so narrow, that [only] two men might pass at a time."
8 And the children of Israel did according as Joakim the High Priest, and the elders of all the people of Israel who sat in Jerusalem, had commanded them.
9 And every man of Israel cried out unto God with great fervour, and they humbled their souls with exceeding fervour,
10 they themselves, and their wives, and their little ones, and their cattle, and every sojourner, and hired servant, and purchased slave among them, put sackcloth upon their loins.
11 And every man of Israel, and woman, and the children, and all they that dwelt in Jerusalem, fell down before the Temple, and strewed ashes upon their heads, and spread forth their sackcloths before the face of the Lord.
12 And they encompassed the altar with sackcloth, and cried out unto the God of Israel with one accord, earnestly, that He might not give their little ones unto plunder, nor their wives unto spoil, nor the cities of their inheritance unto utter destruction, nor the holy things unto defilement and reproach, to be a rejoicing unto the nations.
13 And the Lord heard their voice, and beheld their affliction; and the people fasted many days throughout all Judea and Jerusalem, before the holy places of the Lord Almighty.
14 And Joakim the High Priest, and all they that stood before the Lord, even the priests who ministered unto the Lord, having their loins girded with sackcloth, offered the burnt offering of the daily sacrifice, and the vows, and the freewill offerings of the people.
15 And there was ashes upon their mitres; and they made supplication unto the Lord with all their might, for the good visitation of all the house of Israel.

#### CHAPTER 5

1 And it was reported unto Holofernes, the chief captain of the army of Asshur, that the children of Israel had prepared themselves for war, and had shut up the passes of the hill country, and had fortified every high mountain peak,
2 and had laid stumbling blocks in the plains. And he was wroth with exceeding fury, and he called all the rulers of Moab, and the generals of the children of Ammon, and all the satraps of the seacoast,
3 and said unto them, "Declare ye now unto me, O ye children of Canaan, what people is this that dwelleth in the hill country, and what cities they inhabit, and the multitude of their host, and wherein lieth their power, and their strength, and who is the king that hath risen over them, leading their campaign?"
4 "And wherefore have they turned their backs, refusing to come forth to meet me, contrary to all them that dwell in the west?"
5 And Achior, the leader of all the children of Ammon, said unto him, "Let my lord, I pray thee, hear a word from the mouth of thy servant, and I will declare unto thee the truth concerning this people, which inhabiteth this hill country, dwelling nigh unto thee; and there shall no falsehood proceed from the mouth of thy servant.
6 This people are the descendants of the Chaldeans,
7 and they sojourned aforetime in Mesopotamia, for they would not follow the gods of their fathers,
8 who were in the land of the Chaldeans; and they departed from the way of their parents, and worshipped the God of heaven, the God Whom they had come to know; and [the Chaldeans] cast them out from before their gods, and they fled into Mesopotamia, and sojourned there for many days.
9 And their God commanded them to depart from their sojourning, and to go into the land of Canaan; and they dwelt therein, and were multiplied with gold and with silver, and with very much cattle;
10 and they went down into Egypt, for a famine had covered the face of the land of Canaan, and they sojourned there until they were nourished; and they became there a great multitude, insomuch that the number of their race could not be told.
11 And the king of Egypt rose up against them, and dealt subtly with them, and humbled them with travail and with brickmaking, and made them bond-slaves.
12 And they cried out unto their God, and He smote all the land of Egypt with plagues, wherein there was no healing; and [the Egyptians] cast them out."
