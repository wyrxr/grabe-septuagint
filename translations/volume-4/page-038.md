ΚΕΦ. Ι´.
Θεὸς τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν δῴη σοι εἰς χάριν, καὶ τελειῶσαι τὰ
ἐπιτηδεύματά σου εἰς γαυρίαμα υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ὕψωμα Ἱερου-
σαλήμ. Καὶ προσεκύνησε τῷ Θεῷ, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτούς· ἐπιτά- 9
ξατε ἀνοῖξαί μοι τὴν πύλην τῆς πόλεως, καὶ ἐξελεύσομαι εἰς τε-
λείωσιν τῶν λόγων, ὧν ἐλαλήσατε μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ. Καὶ συνέταξαν τοῖς
νεανίσκοις ἀνοῖξαι αὐτῇ καθότι ἐλάλησε. Καὶ ἐποίησαν οὕτως. 10
Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Ἰουδίθ, αὐτὴ καὶ ἡ παιδίσκη αὐτῆς μετ᾿ αὐτῆς. Ἀ-
πεσκόπευον δὲ αὐτὴν οἱ ἄνδρες τῆς πόλεως ἕως οὗ κατέβη τὸ
ὄρος, ἕως οὗ διῆλθε τὸν αὐλῶνα, καὶ οὐκ ἔτι ἐθεωροῦσαν αὐ-
τήν. Καὶ ἐπορεύοντο ἐν τῷ αὐλῶνι εἰς εὐθεῖαν, καὶ συνήντησεν 11
αὐτῇ προφυλακὴ τῶν Ἀσσυρίων. Καὶ συνέλαβον αὐτήν, καὶ ἐπη- 12
ρώτησαν, τίνων εἶ; καὶ πόθεν ἔρχῃ; καὶ ποῦ πορεύῃ; Καὶ εἶπε·
Θύγατηρ εἰμὶ τῶν Ἑβραίων, καὶ ἀποδιδράσκω ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐ-
τῶν, ὅτι μέλλουσι δίδοσθαι ὑμῖν εἰς κατάβρωμα. Κἀγὼ ἔρχομαι 13
εἰς τὸ πρόσωπον Ὁλοφέρνου ἀρχιστρατήγου δυνάμεως ὑμῶν, τοῦ
ἀπαγγεῖλαι ῥήματα ἀληθείας· καὶ δείξω πρὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ
ὁδὸν, καθ᾿ ἣν πορεύσεται, καὶ κυριεύσει πάσης τῆς ὀρεινῆς, καὶ
οὐ διαφωνήσει τῶν ἀνδρῶν αὐτοῦ σάρξ μία, οὐδὲ πνεῦμα ζωῆς.
Ὡς δὲ ἤκουσαν οἱ ἄνδρες τὰ ῥήματα αὐτῆς, καὶ κατενόησαν τὸ 14
πρόσωπον αὐτῆς, καὶ ἦν ἐναντίον αὐτῶν θαυμασία τῷ κάλλει σφό-
δρα, καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς αὐτήν. Σέσωκας τὴν ψυχήν σου, σπεύσασα 15
καταβῆναι εἰς πρόσωπον τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν· καὶ νῦν πρόσέλθε ἐπὶ
τὴν σκηνὴν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀφ᾿ ἡμῶν προπέμψουσί σε ἕως παραδώσουσι
σε εἰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ. Ἐὰν δὲ στῇς ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ, μὴ φοβηθῇς 16
τῇ καρδίᾳ σου, ἀλλὰ ἀνάγγειλον κατὰ τὰ ῥήματά σου, καὶ εὖ σε
ποιήσει. Καὶ ἐπέλεξαν ἐξ αὐτῶν ἄνδρας ἑκατόν, καὶ παρέζευξαν 17
αὐτῇ καὶ τῇ ἄβρᾳ αὐτῆς, καὶ ἤγαγον αὐτὰς ἐπὶ τὴν σκηνὴν Ὁ-
λοφέρνου. Καὶ ἐγένετο συνδρομὴ ἐν πάσῃ τῇ παρεμβολῇ· διεβοήθη 18
γὰρ εἰς τὰ σκηνώματα ἡ παρουσία αὐτῆς. Καὶ ἐλθόντες ἐκύκλουν
αὐτὴν ὡς εἰστήκει ἔξω τῆς σκηνῆς Ὁλοφέρνου, ἕως προσήγγειλαν
αὐτῷ περὶ αὐτῆς. Καὶ ἐθαύμαζον ἐπὶ τῷ κάλλει αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐ- 19
θαύμαζον τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ ἀπὸ αὐτῆς· καὶ εἶπαν ἕκαστος πρὸς
τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ· τίς καταφρονήσει τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου, ὃς ἔχει
ἐν ἑαυτῷ γυναῖκας τοιαύτας; ὅτι οὐ καλὸν ἐστιν ἐξ αὐτῶν ὑπο-
λεῖφθαι ἄνδρα ἕνα, εἰ ἀφεθέντες δυνήσονται κατασοφίσασθαι πᾶ-
σαν τὴν γῆν. Καὶ ἐξῆλθον οἱ παρακαθεύδοντες Ὁλοφέρνῃ καὶ 20

#### CHAPTER 10

**8** God of our fathers grant unto thee grace, and perfect thy undertakings unto the glory of the children of Israel, and the exaltation of Jerusalem.

**9** And she bowed herself down unto God, and said unto them: "Command ye that the gate of the city be opened for me, and I shall go forth unto the fulfilment of the words which ye have spoken with me."

**10** And they gave command unto the young men to open [the gate] for her, even as she had spoken. And they did so. And Judith went forth, she and her handmaid with her. But the men of the city watched her until she went down the mountain, and until she had passed through the valley; and they saw her no more.

**11** And they went directly in the valley, and an outpost of the Assyrians met her.

**12** And they seized her, and asked [of her]: "Whose art thou? and whence comest thou? and whither goest thou?" And she said: "I am a daughter of the Hebrews, and I flee from before them, for they are about to be given unto you for a prey."

**13** "And I come before Holofernes, the chief captain of your host, to declare unto him words of verity; and I shall show before his face a path by which he shall go, and he shall conquer all the hill country, and not one of his men shall be lost, nor a breath of life [be extinguished]."

**14** But when the men heard her words, and beheld her countenance, and she was before them exceedingly wondrous in beauty, they said unto her:

**15** "Thou hast saved thy soul by hastening to come down before the face of our lord; and now draw near unto his tent, and from our company shall they send thee forth, until they shall deliver thee into his hands."

**16** "But if thou stand before him, fear not in thy heart, but declare [unto him] according to thy words, and he shall deal well with thee."

**17** And they chose out from among themselves a hundred men, and appointed them to attend her and her handmaid, and they led them unto the tent of Holofernes.

**18** And there was a great concourse in all the camp, for her presence was noised abroad throughout the tents. And they came and encircled her as she stood outside the tent of Holofernes, until they made report concerning her unto him.

**19** And they marvelled at her beauty, and marvelled at the sons of Israel because of her. And each one said unto his neighbour: "Who shall despise this people, that hath within itself such women as these? For it is not well that a single man of them should be left alive, if, being let go, they shall be able to outwit all the earth."

**20** And there came forth they that attended Holofernes, and
