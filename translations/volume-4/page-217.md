ΚΕΦ. ΙϚʹ.ΙΖʹ.
**21** σφαγιάσαι Ἰσαάκ, καὶ τὴν πατρῴαν χεῖρα ξιφηφόρον καταφερομένων ἐπ’ αὐτὸν ὁρῶν ὁ Ἰσαὰκ οὐκ ἔπτηξεν. Καὶ Δανιὴλ ὁ δίκαιος εἰς λέοντας ἐβλήθη· καὶ Ἀνανίας, καὶ Ἀζαρίας, καὶ Μισαὴλ εἰς κάμινον πυρὸς ἀπεσφενδονήθησαν, καὶ ὑπέμειναν, διὰ
**22** τὸν Θεόν. Καὶ ἡμεῖς οὖν τὴν αὐτὴν πίστιν πρὸς τὸν Θεὸν ἔχοντες, μὴ χαλεπαίνητε.
**23** Ἀλόγιστον γὰρ εἰδότας εὐσέβειαν μὴ ἀντιστῆναι τοῖς πόνοις.
**24** Διὰ τούτων τῶν λόγων ἡ ἑπταμήτωρ ἕνα ἕκαστον τῶν υἱῶν παρακαλοῦσα, ἀποθανεῖν ἔπεισε μᾶλλον, ἢ
**25** παραβῆναι τὴν ἐντολὴν τοῦ Θεοῦ. Ἔτι δὲ καὶ ταῦτα εἰδότες, ὅτι οἱ διὰ τὸν Θεὸν ἀποθανόντες ζῶσιν τῷ Θεῷ, ὥσπερ Ἀβραὰμ καὶ Ἰσαὰκ καὶ Ἰακώβ, καὶ πάντες οἱ πατριάρχαι.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΖʹ. XVII.

**1** Ἔλεγον δὲ καὶ τῶν δορυφόρων τινές, ὡς ὅτε ἔμελλεν καὶ αὐτὴ συλλαμβάνεσθαι πρὸς θάνατον, ἵνα μὴ ψυχύσῃ τις τοῦ σώματος ἔχουσα ἑαυτὴν ἐῤῥίψεν κατὰ τῆς πυρᾶς.
**2** Ὦ μῆτρο συνεπτά παισὶν καταλύσασα τὴν τοῦ τυράννου βίαν, καὶ ἀκυρώσασα τὰς κακὰς ἐπινοίας αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπιδείξασα τὴν τῆς πίστεως γενναιότητα.
**3** Καθάπερ γὰρ σὺ στέγη ἐπὶ τοῦ στύλου τῶν παίδων γενναίως ἑδρυμένη, ἀκλινῶς ὑπήνεγκας τὸν διὰ τῶν βασάνων σεισμόν.
**4** Θάῤῥει τοιγαροῦν, ὦ μῆτερ ἱερόψυχε. τὴν ἐλπίδα τῆς
**5** ὑπομονῆς γενναίως ἔχουσα πρὸς Θεόν. Οὐχ οὕτω σελήνη κατ’ οὐρανὸν σὺν ἄστροις σεμνὴ καθέστηκεν, ὡς σὺ τοὺς ἰσαστέρους
**6** ἑπτὰ παῖδας φωταγωγήσασα πρὸς τὴν εὐσέβειαν καθέστηκας Θεῷ, καὶ ἐστήρισαι ἐν οὐρανῷ σὺν αὐτοῖς.
**7** Ἦν γὰρ ἡ παιδοποιία σου ἀπὸ Ἀβραὰμ τοῦ πατρός. Εἰ δὲ ἐξὸν ἡμῖν ἦν, ὥσπερ ἐπί τινος πίνακος, ζωγραφῆσαι τὴν τῆς εὐσεβείας ἱστορίαν,
**8** οὐκ ἂν ἔρριπτον οἱ θεωροῦντες μητέρα ἑπτὰ τέκνων δι’ εὐσέβειαν ποικίλας βασάνους μέχρι θανάτου ὑπομείνασαν. Καὶ γὰρ ἄξιον
**9** ἦν καὶ ἐπὶ αὐτοῦ τοῦ ἐπιταφίου ἀναγράψαι καὶ ταῦτα τοῖς ἀπὸ τοῦ ἔθνους εἰς μνείαν λεγόμενα. Ἐνταῦθα γέρων ἱερεύς, καὶ
**10** γυνὴ γραιά, καὶ ἑπτὰ παῖδες ἐγκεκήδευνται διὰ τυράννου βίαν, τὴν Ἑβραίων πολιτείαν καταλῦσαι θέλοντος. Οἳ καὶ ἐξεδίκτησαν
**11** τὸ ἔθνος εἰς Θεὸν ἀφορῶντες, καὶ μέχρι θανάτου τὰς βασάνους ὑπομείναντες. Ἀληθῶς γὰρ ἦν ἀγὼν θεῖος ὁ δι’ αὐτῶν γεγενημένος.

A free and highly literary translation:

**CHAPTER XVI.**
**21** to slay Isaac; and when Isaac beheld his father's hand, bearing the sword, descending upon him, he did not shrink back in fear. And Daniel the righteous was cast into [the den of] lions; and Ananias, and Azarias, and Mishael were hurled into a furnace of fire, and they did endure, for the sake of
**22** God. And we, therefore, having the selfsame faith toward God, do not ye grow faint of heart.
**23** For it is an unreasonable thing, if, knowing piety, ye should not withstand the pains.
**24** By these words did the mother of seven, exhorting each one of her sons, persuade them rather to die than to
**25** transgress the commandment of God. Moreover, know ye these things also: that they who have died for the sake of God live unto God, even as Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, and all the patriarchs.

**CHAPTER XVII.**
**1** And some of the spearmen did also report, that when she herself was about to be apprehended unto death, lest any [person] of the body should falter, she, having herself [in readiness], cast herself upon the pyre.
**2** O mother, who with seven children didst bring to naught the tyrant's violence, and didst annul his wicked devices, and didst make manifest the nobility of the Faith!
**3** For as thou, a roof nobly established upon the pillar of thy children, didst unswervingly bear the earthquake [that came] through the torments.
**4** Be of good cheer, therefore, O mother of holy soul, having the hope of
**5** endurance nobly unto God. Not so doth the moon in heaven stand forth in majesty with stars, as thou the seven sons, like unto stars,
**6** having enlightened them unto piety, art thou established before God, and art made firm in heaven with them.
**7** For thy child-bearing was of Abraham, our father. And if it were permitted unto us, as upon some tablet, to depict the history of Piety,
**8** they who beheld would not have disdained a mother of seven children who, for piety's sake, did endure diverse torments even unto death. For indeed it was fitting
**9** also to inscribe upon the very epitaph these words, which are spoken for a remembrance to those of the nation: "Herein a venerable priest, and
**10** an aged woman, and seven children have been interred, because of the violence of a tyrant who sought to overthrow the commonwealth of the Hebrews. Who also did avenge
**11** the nation, looking unto God, and enduring the torments even unto death. For truly a divine contest was that which, through them, hath come to pass."
