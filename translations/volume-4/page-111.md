παρακλήσεως καὶ ὕψους καὶ δομάτων, ὅπως ὦσι σὺν ἐμοὶ εἰς βο-
25 ήθειαν. Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν αὐτοῖς κατὰ τοὺς λόγους τούτους· Βα-
26 σιλεὺς Δημήτριος τῷ ἔθνει τῶν Ἰουδαίων χαίρειν. Ἐπεὶ συνε-
    τηρήσατε τὰς πρὸς ἡμᾶς συνθήκας, καὶ ἐνεμείνατε τῇ φιλίᾳ ἡ-
    μῶν, καὶ οὐ προσεχωρήσατε τοῖς ἐχθροῖς ἡμῶν, ἠκούσαμεν καὶ
27 ἐχάρημεν. Καὶ νῦν ἐμείνατε ἔτι τοῦ συντηρῆσαι πρὸς ἡμᾶς πί-
    στιν, καὶ ἀνταποδώσομεν ὑμῖν ἀγαθά, ἀνθ’ ὧν ποιεῖτε μεθ’ ἡμῶν.
28 Καὶ ἀφήσομεν ὑμῖν ἀφέματα πολλὰ, καὶ δώσομεν ὑμῖν δόματα.
29 Καὶ νῦν ἀπολύω ὑμᾶς, καὶ ἀφίημι πάντας τοὺς Ἰουδαίους ἀπὸ
30 τῶν φόρων καὶ τῆς τιμῆς τοῦ ἁλὸς, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν στεφάνων. Καὶ
    ἀντὶ τοῦ τρίτου τῆς σπορᾶς, καὶ ἀντὶ τοῦ ἡμίσους τοῦ καρποῦ
    τοῦ ξυλίνου τοῦ ἐπιβάλλοντός μοι λαβεῖν, ἀφίημι ἀπὸ τῆς σή-
    μερον καὶ ἐπέκεινα τοῦ λαβεῖν ἀπὸ τῆς Ἰούδα, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν
    τριῶν νομῶν τῶν προστιθεμένων αὐτῇ ἀπὸ τῆς Σαμαρείτιδος
    καὶ Γαλιλαίας, ἀπὸ τῆς σήμερον ἡμέρας καὶ εἰς τὸν ἅπαντα
31 χρόνον. Καὶ Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἤτω ἁγία καὶ ἀφειμένη καὶ τὰ ὅρια αὐ-
32 τῆς, αἱ δεκάται καὶ τὰ τέλη. Ἀφίημι καὶ τὴν ἐξουσίαν τῆς
    ἄκρας τῆς ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ, καὶ δίδωμι τῷ ἀρχιερεῖ, ὅπως ἂν
    καταστῇ ἐν αὐτῇ ἄνδρας, οὓς ἂν ἐκλέξηται αὐτὸς τοῦ φυλάσ-
33 σειν αὐτήν. Καὶ πᾶσαν ψυχὴν Ἰουδαίων τὴν αἰχμαλωτισθεῖ-
    σαν ἀπὸ γῆς Ἰούδα εἰς πᾶσαν βασιλείαν μου ἀφίημι ἐλευθέραν δω-
34 ρεάν· καὶ πάντες ἀφιέτωσαν τοὺς φόρους καὶ κτηνῶν αὐτῶν. Καὶ
    πᾶσαι αἱ ἑορταὶ καὶ τὰ σάββατα καὶ νουμηνίαι, καὶ ἡμέραι ἀπο-
    δεδειγμέναι, καὶ τρεῖς ἡμέραι πρὸ ἑορτῆς καὶ τρεῖς ἡμέραι
    μετὰ ἑορτὴν ἔστωσαν πᾶσαι αἱ ἡμέραι ἀτελείας καὶ ἀφέσεως
35 πᾶσι τοῖς Ἰουδαίοις τοῖς οὖσιν ἐν πάσῃ τῇ βασιλείᾳ μου. Καὶ
    οὐχ ἕξει ἐξουσίαν οὐδεὶς πράσσειν καὶ παρενοχλεῖν τινα αὐτῶν
36 περὶ παντὸς πράγματος. Καὶ προγραφτήτωσαν τῶν Ἰουδαίων εἰς
    τὰς δυνάμεις τοῦ βασιλέως εἰς τριάκοντα χιλιάδας ἀνδρῶν καὶ
    δοθήσεται αὐτοῖς ξένια, ὡς καθήκει πάσαις ταῖς δυνάμεσι τοῦ
37 βασιλέως. Καὶ κατασαβθήσεται ἐξ αὐτῶν ἐν τοῖς ὀχυρώμασι τοῦ
    βασιλέως τοῖς μεγάλοις, καὶ ἐκ τούτων κατασταθήσεται ἐπὶ
    χρειῶν τῆς βασιλείας τῶν οὐσῶν εἰς πίστιν· καὶ οἱ ἐπ’ αὐτῶν
    καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες ἐξ αὐτῶν ἔστωσαν, καὶ πορευέσθωσαν τοῖς νό-
    μοις αὐτῶν, καθὰ καὶ προσέταξεν ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐν γῇ Ἰού-
38 δα. Καὶ τοὺς τρεῖς νομοὺς τοὺς προστεθέντας τῇ Ἰουδαίᾳ ἀπὸ

**10:25** And he sent unto them according to these words:
**10:26** King Demetrius to the nation of the Jews, [sends] greetings. Forasmuch as ye have kept the covenants with us, and have abided in our friendship, and have not gone over unto our enemies, we have heard [of this] and rejoiced.
**10:27** And now have ye yet continued to maintain faith toward us, and we will recompense you with good things, for those things which ye do with us.
**10:28** And we will grant you many remissions, and will bestow upon you gifts.
**10:29** And now do I release you, and I do set free all the Jews from the tributes and from the salt-tax, and from the crown-payments.
**10:30** And instead of the third part of the sowing, and instead of the half of the fruit of the trees, which it is due unto me to receive, I forgo from this day forth and henceforth the receiving [of it] from Judah, and from the three districts added unto her from Samaria and Galilee, from this day forth and for all time.
**10:31** And let Jerusalem be holy and exempt, and her borders, and her tithes and her taxes.
**10:32** I also release the authority over the citadel in Jerusalem, and I bestow it upon the high priest, that he may appoint men therein, whomsoever he himself shall choose, to keep guard over it.
**10:33** And every soul of the Jews who hath been taken captive from the land of Judah into any of my kingdom, I release freely; and let all [be released from] their tributes and [from the dues upon] their cattle.
**10:34** And all the feasts and the Sabbaths and new moons, and designated days, and three days before a feast and three days after a feast, let all these days be days of exemption from taxation and of full release for all the Jews who are in all my kingdom.
**10:35** And none shall have authority to exact [payment] or to trouble any of them concerning any matter.
**10:36** And let thirty thousand men of the Jews be enrolled into the king's forces, and provisions shall be given them, as is fitting for all the king's forces.
**10:37** And from among them shall be given rest in the great strongholds of the king, and from these shall be appointed over the needs of the kingdom which require faithfulness; and those who are over them and their rulers shall be from among them, and they shall walk according to their own laws, as the king hath also commanded in the land of Judah.
**10:38** And the three districts which have been added to Judea from
