ΚΕΦ. ΙΖʹ. XVII.
18 ἔθνει κατέστησεν ἡγούμενον, καὶ μερὶς Κυρίου Ἰσραὴλ ἔστιν· ὃν
19 πρωτόγονον ὄντα τιθηνεῖ παιδείᾳ, καὶ μερίζων φῶς ἀγαπήσεως·
20 οὐκ ἀνήσιν αὐτόν. Πάντα τὰ ἔργα αὐτῶν ὡς ὁ ἥλιος ἐναντίον
21 αὐτοῦ, καὶ οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτοῦ ἐνδελεχες ἐπὶ τὰς ὁδοὺς αὐτῶν·
22 οὐκ ἐκρύβησαν αἱ ἀδικίαι αὐτῶν ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ, καὶ πᾶσαι αἱ ἁμαρτίαι
23 αὐτῶν ἔναντι Κυρίου. Κύριος δὲ χρηστὸς ὤν, καὶ εἰδὼς τὸ πλά-
24 σμα αὐτοῦ, οὔτε ἀνῆκεν, οὔτε κατέλιπε, φειδόμενος αὐτῶν. Ἐ-
25 λεημοσύνη γὰρ ἀνδρὸς ὡς σφραγὶς μετ’ αὐτοῦ, καὶ χάριν ἀνθρώ-
26 που ὡς κόρην συντηρήσει, μερίζων υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ καὶ θυγατράσι
27 μετάνοιαν. Μετὰ ταῦτα ἐξαναστήσεται· καὶ ἀνταποδώσει αὐτοῖς,
28 καὶ τὸ ἀνταπόδομα αὐτῶν εἰς κεφαλὴν αὐτῶν ἀποδώσει· πλὴν
29 μετανοοῦσιν ἔδωκεν ἐπάνοδον, καὶ παρεκάλεσεν ἐκλείποντας ὑπο-
30 μονήν. Ἐπίστρεφε ἐπὶ Κύριον, καὶ ἀπόλειπε ἁμαρτίας· δέηθητι
31 κατὰ πρόσωπον, καὶ σμίκρυνον πρόςκομμα· ἐπάναγε ἐπὶ Ὕψιστον,
32 καὶ ἀπόστρεφε ἀπὸ ἀδικίας, (αὐτὸς γὰρ ἐδηγήσει ἐκ σκότους εἰς
33 φῶς ὑγιείας·) καὶ σφόδρα μίσησον βδέλυγμα. Ὕψιστῳ τίς αἰνέ-
34 σει ἐν ᾅδου ἀντὶ ζώντων καὶ διδόντων ἀνθομολόγησιν; Ἀπὸ νε-
35 κροῦ ὡς μηδὲ ὄντος ἀπόλλυται ἐξομολόγησις· ζῶν καὶ ὑγιὴς τῇ
36 καρδίᾳ αἰνέσει τὸν Κύριον. Ὡς μεγάλη ἡ ἐλεημοσύνη τοῦ Κυρίου
37 τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν, καὶ ἐξιλασμὸς τοῖς ἐπιστρέφουσιν ἐπ’ αὐτὸν ὁσίως.
38 Οὐ γὰρ δύναται πάντα εἶναι ἐν ἀνθρώποις· ὅτι οὐκ ἀθά-
39 νατος ὁ υἱὸς ἀνθρώπου. Τί φωτεινότερον ἡλίου; καὶ τοῦτο ἐκλεί-
40 πει· καὶ πονηρὸν ἐνθυμηθήσεται σὰρξ καὶ αἷμα. Δύναμιν ὕψους
41 οὐρανοῦ αὐτὸς ἐπισκέπτεται, καὶ ἄνθρωποι πάντες γῆ καὶ σποδός.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΗʹ. XVIII.
1 Ὁ ζῶν εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα ἔκτισε τὰ πάντα κοινῇ.
2 Κύριος μόνος
3 δικαιωθήσεται, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἄλλος πλὴν αὐτοῦ· ὁ διατάσσων τὸν
4 κόσμον ἐν σπιθαμῇ χειρὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντα ὑπακούει τῷ θελή-
5 ματι αὐτοῦ· αὐτὸς γὰρ βασιλεὺς πάντων ἐν κράτει αὐτοῦ, δια-
6 στέλλων ἐν αὐτοῖς ἅγια ἀπὸ βεβήλων. Οὐδενὶ ἐξεποίησεν ἐξαγ-
7 γεῖλαι τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ, καὶ τίς ἐξιχνεύσει τὰ μεγαλεῖα αὐτοῦ;
8 Κράτος μεγαλωσύνης αὐτοῦ τίς ἐξαριθμήσεται; καὶ τίς προσθή-
9 σει ἐκδιηγήσασθαι τὰ ἐλέη αὐτοῦ; Οὐκ ἔστιν ἐλαττῶσαι οὐδὲ
10 προσθεῖναι, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἐξιχνιάσαι τὰ θαυμάσια τοῦ Κυρίου·

**Chapter Seventeen**

...over each nation did He set a ruler,
yet the portion of the Lord is Israel, whom,
being His firstborn, He doth nurse with discipline,
and imparting the light of love, He shall not forsake him.
All their works are as the sun before Him,
and His eyes are ever-present upon their ways;
their unrighteous deeds are not hidden from Him,
and all their sins are before the Lord.
But the Lord, being gracious, and knowing His own creation,
neither hath He forsaken them, nor abandoned them,
for He doth spare them.
For the mercy of a man is as a seal with him,
and the grace of a man as the pupil of the eye shall He preserve,
distributing repentance unto his sons and daughters.
After these things shall He arise; and He shall recompense them,
and their recompense shall He render upon their own head;
but unto those who repent did He grant return,
and He did exhort those who were failing in steadfastness.
Return now unto the Lord, and forsake thy sins;
make supplication before His face,
and diminish thy stumbling-block;
lead back unto the Most High,
and turn away from unrighteousness,
(for He shall lead thee out of darkness into the light of wholeness;)
and utterly hate abomination.
Who shall praise the Most High in Hades,
instead of the living and those who offer thanksgiving?
From the dead, as from one who is not, is praise destroyed;
but the living and he that is sound in heart shall praise the Lord.
How great is the mercy of the Lord our God,
and how holy is His propitiation for those who turn back unto Him!
For not all things can be in men;
because the son of man is not immortal.
What is brighter than the sun? Yet this doth fail;
and flesh and blood shall imagine evil.
The power of the height of heaven doth He visit,
and all men are but earth and dust.

**Chapter Eighteen**

He that liveth for ever created all things together.
The Lord alone shall be justified,
and there is none other beside Him;
He that setteth in order the world in the span of His hand,
and all things obey His will;
for He Himself is King of all in His might,
distinguishing among them holy things from profane.
To no one hath He made it possible to declare His works,
and who shall trace out His great deeds?
The might of His majesty, who shall count it?
And who shall add to declare His mercies?
It is not possible to diminish, nor to add,
and it is not possible to trace out the marvels of the Lord;
