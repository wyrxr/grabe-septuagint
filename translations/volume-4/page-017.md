1 ΚΑΙ ἐκάλεσε Τωβὶτ Τωβίαν τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ·
    ὄρα, τέκνον, μισθὸν τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ τῷ συνελθόντι σοι· καὶ προ-
2 σθῆναι αὐτῷ δεῖ. ΚΑΙ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· πάτερ, οὐ βλάπτομαι δοὺς
3 αὐτῷ τὸ ἥμισυ ὧν ἐνήνοχα, ὅτι με ἀπήγαγέ σοι ὑγιῆ, καὶ τὴν γυ-
    ναῖκά μου ἐθεράπευσε, καὶ τὸ ἀργύριόν μου ἤνεγκε, καὶ σὲ ὁμοίως
4.5 ἐθεράπευσε. ΚΑΙ εἶπεν ὁ πρεσβύτης· δικαιοῦται αὐτῷ. ΚΑΙ ἐκά-
    λεσε τὸν ἄγγελον, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· λαβὲ τὸ ἥμισυ πάντων ὧν
6 ἐνηνόχατε, καὶ ὕπαγε ὑγιαίνων. Τότε καλέσας τοὺς δύο κρυπτῶς,
    εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· εὐλογεῖτε τὸν Θεόν, καὶ αὐτῷ ἐξομολογεῖσθε, καὶ
    μεγαλωσύνην δίδοτε αὐτῷ, καὶ ἐξομολογεῖσθε ἐνώπιον πάντων τῶν
    ζώντων περὶ ὧν ἐποίησε μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν. ἀγαθὸν τὸ εὐλογεῖν τὸν Θεόν,
    καὶ ὑψοῦν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ, τοὺς λόγους τῶν ἔργων τοῦ Θεοῦ
    ἐντίμως ὑποδεικνύοντες· καὶ μὴ ὀκνεῖτε ἐξομολογεῖσθαι αὐτῷ.
7 Μυστήριον βασιλέως καλὸν κρύπτειν, τὰ δὲ ἔργα τοῦ Θεοῦ ἀνα-
    καλύπτειν ἐνδόξως· ἀγαθὸν ποιήσατε, καὶ κακὸν οὐχ εὑρήσει ὑμᾶς.
8 Ἀγαθὸν προσευχὴ μετὰ νηστείας καὶ ἐλεημοσύνης καὶ δικαιοσύ-
    νης. ἀγαθὸν τὸ ὀλίγον μετὰ δικαιοσύνης, ἢ πολὺ μετὰ ἀδικίας.
9 καλὸν τὸ ποιῆσαι ἐλεημοσύνην, ἢ θησαυρίσαι χρυσίον. Ἐλεημο-
    σύνη γὰρ ἐκ θανάτου ῥύεται, καὶ αὕτη ἀποκαθαριεῖ πᾶσαν ἀ-
    μαρτίαν. οἱ ποιοῦντες ἐλεημοσύνας καὶ δικαιοσύνας, πλησθήσον-
10 ται ζωῆς. Οἱ δὲ ἁμαρτάνοντες, πολέμιοι εἰσὶ τῆς ἑαυτῶν ζωῆς.
11 Οὐ μὴ κρύψω ἀφ᾿ ὑμῶν πᾶν ῥῆμα· εἴρηκα δή· μυστήριον βασι-
    λέως κρύψαι καλόν, τὰ δὲ ἔργα τοῦ Θεοῦ ἀνακαλύπτειν ἐνδόξως.
12 ΚΑΙ νῦν ὅτε προσηύξω σὺ καὶ ἡ νύμφη σου Σάρρᾳ, ἐγὼ προσή-
    γαγον τὸ μνημόσυνον τῆς προσευχῆς ὑμῶν ἐνώπιον τοῦ ἁγίου·
13 καὶ ὅτε ἔθαπτε τοὺς νεκρούς, ὡσαύτως συμπαρήγμην σοι. ΚΑΙ
    ὅτε οὐκ ὤκνησας ἀναστῆναι καὶ καταλιπεῖν τὸ ἄριστόν σου, ὅ-

### CHAPTER 11

[Tobit 11:16]
...to Him before them, that God had shown mercy upon him. And when Tobit drew nigh unto Sarah his daughter-in-law, he blessed her, saying, "Be thou well and sound, O daughter! Blessed be God, who hath brought thee unto us, and [blessed be] thy father and thy mother."

[Tobit 11:17]
And there was joy unto all his brethren in Nineveh.

[Tobit 11:18]
And Achiacharus came, and Nasbas his cousin; and the marriage of Tobias was solemnized with gladness for seven days.

### CHAPTER 12

[Tobit 12:1]
AND Tobit called Tobias his son, and said unto him, "See now, my son, [what] reward [we shall give] unto the man who accompanied thee;

[Tobit 12:2]
yea, and it is meet that we add thereto."

[Tobit 12:3]
And he answered him, "Father, I am not harmed [should I be] giving him the half of all that I have brought; for he led me back unto thee sound [and safe], and he healed my wife, and he brought my money, and he likewise healed thee."

[Tobit 12:4-5]
And the old man said, "He is worthy thereof." And he called the angel, and said unto him, "Take thou the half of all that ye have brought, and depart in health."

[Tobit 12:6]
Then, having called the two apart, he said unto them, "Bless ye God, and give Him thanks, and render unto Him greatness, and give ye thanks before all living [men] concerning all that He hath wrought with you. Good it is to bless God, and to exalt His Name, honourably declaring the words of the works of God; and hesitate ye not to give Him thanks."

[Tobit 12:7]
"A king's secret it is good to conceal; but the works of God to reveal gloriously. Do good, and evil shall not find you."

[Tobit 12:8]
"Good is prayer with fasting and almsgiving and righteousness. Better is a little with righteousness, than much with unrighteousness."

[Tobit 12:9]
"Better it is to do almsgiving than to lay up gold. For almsgiving delivereth from death, and the same shall purge away all sin. They who practise almsgiving and righteousness shall be filled with life;

[Tobit 12:10]
but they who sin are enemies of their own lives."

[Tobit 12:11]
"I will not hide from you any word. Indeed I have declared: 'A king's secret it is good to conceal, but the works of God to reveal gloriously.'"

[Tobit 12:12]
"And now, when thou didst pray, and thy daughter-in-law Sarah, I brought the memorial of your prayer before the Holy One;

[Tobit 12:13]
and when he buried the dead, likewise was I with thee. And when thou didst not hesitate to rise up and forsake thy meal, that thou mightest go and shroud the dead, thou didst not take me [for a] benefactor; but with thee I was."
