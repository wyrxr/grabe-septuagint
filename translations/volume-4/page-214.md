Ὦ Λογισμὲ τέκνων, παθῶν τυράννε, καὶ εὐσέβεια μητρὶ τέ- 1
κνων ποθεινοτέρα. Μήτηρ δυσὶν προκειμένων εὐσεβείας, καὶ τῆς 2
τῶν ἑπτὰ υἱῶν σωτηρίας προσκαίρου κατὰ τὴν τοῦ τυράννου ὑπό-
σχεσιν· τὴν εὐσέβειαν μᾶλλον ἠγάπησεν τὴν σώζουσαν εἰς αἰώ- 3
νιον ζωὴν κατὰ Θεόν. Ὧ τίνα τρόπον ἠθολογήσαιμι φιλότεκνα 4
γενέων πάθη, ψυχῆς τε καὶ μορφῆς ὁμοιότητα εἰς μικρὸν παι-
δὸς χαρακτῆρα θαυμάσιον ἐναποσφραγίζοντα, μάλιστα διὰ τὸ πά-
θος τοῖς γεννηθεῖσιν τὰς μητέρας τῶν πατέρων καθεστάναι συμ-
παθεστέρας. Ὅσῳ γὰρ καὶ ἀσθενέψυχοι καὶ πολυγονώτεραι ὑπάρ- 5
χουσιν αἱ μητέρες, τοσοῦτον μᾶλλον εἰσιν φιλοτεκνοτέρχι. Πα- 6
σῶν δὲ τῶν μητέρων ἐγένετο ἡ τῶν ἑπτὰ παίδων μήτηρ φιλο-
τεκνοτέρα, ἥ τις ἑπτὰ κυοφορίαις τὴν πρὸς αὑτοὺς ἐπιρευτευο-
μένην φιλοστοργίαν, καὶ διὰ πολλὰς τὰς καθ’ ἕκαστον αὑτῶν 7
ὠδῖνας ἠναγκασμένη τὴν εἰς αὑτοὺς ἔχειν συμπάθειαν, διὰ τὸν 8
πρὸς τὸν Θεὸν φόβον ὑπερεῖδεν τὴν τῶν τέκνων πρόσκαιρον σω-
τηρίαν. Οὐ μὴν δὲ, ἀλλὰ καὶ διὰ τὴν καλοκἀγαθίαν τῶν υἱῶν, 9
καὶ τὴν πρὸς τὸν νόμον αὑτῶν εὐσέβειαν, μείζω τὴν ἐν αὑτοῖς
ἔσχεν φιλοστοργίαν. Δίκαιοί τε γὰρ ἦσαν, καὶ σώφρονες, καὶ ἀν- 10
δρεῖοι, καὶ μεγαλόψυχοι, καὶ φιλάδελφοι, καὶ φιλομήτορες οὕτως,
ὥστε καὶ μέχρι θανάτου τὰ νόμιμα φυλάσσοντες πείθεσθαι αὑ-
τῇ. Ἀλλ’ ὅμως καίπερ τοσοῦτον ὄντων τῶν περὶ φιλοτεκνίαν 11
εἰς συμπάθειαι ἑλκόντων τὴν μητέρα, ἐπ’ οὐδενὸς αὑτῶν τὸν λο-
γισμὸν αὑτῆς αἱ παμποίκιλοι βάσανοι ἴσχυσαν μεταστρέψαι. Ἀλ- 12
λὰ καὶ καθ’ ἕνα παῖδα καὶ ὁμοῦ πάντας ἡ μήτηρ ἐπὶ τὸν ὑπὲρ
τῆς εὐσεβείας προετρέπετο θάνατον. Ὦ φύσις ἱερά, καὶ φίλτρα 13
γονέων καὶ σύνεσις φιλόστοργε, καὶ τροφεῖα, καὶ μητέρων ἀδά-
μαστα πάθη. Καθ’ ἕνα στρεβλούμενον καὶ φλεγόμενον ἐῶσα 14
μήτηρ, οὐ μετεβάλετο διὰ τὴν εὐσέβειαν. Τὰς σάρκας τῶν τέ- 15
κνων ἑώρα περὶ τὸ πῦρ τηκομένας, καὶ τοὺς τῶν ποδῶν καὶ
χειρῶν δακτύλους ἐπὶ γῆς σπαίροντας, καὶ τὰς τῶν κεφαλῶν μέ-
χρι τῶν περὶ τὰ γένεια σάρκας, ὥσπερ προσωπία προκειμέ-
νας. Ὦ πικροτέρων μὲν νῦν μήτηρ πόνων πειρασθεῖσα, ἥπερ 16
τῶν ἐπ’ αὑτοῖς ὠδίνων. Ὦ μόνη γυνὴ τὴν εὐσέβειαν ἐλάληρον 17

**CHAPTER XV.**

**1** O Reason, [thou] guide of children, [and thou] tyrant of passions; and [O] Piety, more desired by a mother than [her] children!
**2** A mother, when two [things] were set before [her]: [namely,] piety, and the temporary salvation of her seven sons, according to the tyrant’s promise;
**3** did choose piety the more, which saveth unto life eternal, according to God’s [will].
**4** O, in what wise shall I portray the parental passions of motherly love, [which do] imprint the likeness of both soul and form upon the wondrous character of a small child? especially, because of the very travail [of childbearing] for those who have been born, are mothers rendered more compassionate than fathers.
**5** For as much as mothers are both faint-hearted and more prolific, so much the more are they loving of children.
**6** But of all mothers, the mother of the seven children did become more loving of children; she, who by seven pregnancies, did hold a love bestowed upon them;
**7** and by the many birth-pangs for each one of them, was constrained to have compassion for them;
**8** yet by reason of the fear of God, did she disregard the temporary salvation of her children.
**9** Moreover, not only so, but also by reason of the noble goodness of her sons, and their piety towards the Law, did she hold within them a greater familial love.
**10** For they were both righteous, and temperate, and brave, and magnanimous, and loving of their brethren, and so loving of their mother,
**11** that even unto death, keeping the laws, they did obey her. But nevertheless, though so many [were the things] concerning [her] love for children, [drawing] the mother into compassion, yet on none of them did the manifold torments prevail to turn aside her reason.
**12** But even each child singly, and all together, did the mother urge on unto death for piety’s sake.
**13** O sacred Nature, and [O] affections of parents, and [O] loving understanding, and [O] nurturing care, and [O] indomitable passions of mothers!
**14** A mother, leaving each one [of them] to be tortured and burned, was not turned aside by reason of piety.
**15** She beheld the flesh of her children melting by the fire, and the fingers of their feet and hands twitching upon the ground; yea, and the flesh of their heads, down unto their chins, lying like as masks.
**16** O mother, who didst now suffer pains more bitter than the travail for them!
**17** O sole woman, who didst give utterance to piety,
