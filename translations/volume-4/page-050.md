Ο ΙΕΡΕΥΣ

ΚΕΦΑΛΑΙΟΝ Α΄. Ι.

1. ΚΑΙ ἤγαγεν Ἰωσίας τὸ Πάσχα ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ τῷ Κυρίῳ ἑαυτοῦ, καὶ ἔθυσαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ τὸ Πάσχα τῇ τεσσαρεσκαιδεκάτῃ ἡμέρᾳ τοῦ μηνὸς τοῦ πρώτου.
2. στήσας τοὺς ἱερεῖς κατ’ ἐφημερίας ἐστολισμένους ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ τοῦ Κυρίου.
3. Καὶ εἶπε τοῖς Λευΐταις ἱεροδούλοις τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ, ἁγιάσαι ἑαυτοὺς τῷ Κυρίῳ ἐν τῇ θέσει τῆς ἁγίας κιβωτοῦ τοῦ Κυρίου ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ, ᾧ ᾠκοδόμησε Σαλωμὼν ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ Δαυΐδ ὁ βασιλεύς.
4. Οὐκ ἔσται ὑμῖν ἄραι ἐπ’ ὤμων αὐτὴν, καὶ νῦν λατρεύετε τῷ Κυρίῳ Θεῷ ὑμῶν, καὶ θεραπεύετε τὸ ἔθνος αὐτοῦ Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ ἑτοιμάσατε κατὰ τὰς πατριάς καὶ τὰς φυλὰς ὑμῶν, κατὰ τὴν γραφὴν Δαυΐδ βασιλέως Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ κατὰ τὴν μεγαλειότητα Σαλωμὼν τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ.
5. Καὶ στάντες ἐν τῷ ἁγίῳ κατὰ τὴν μεριδαρχίαν τὴν πατρικὴν ὑμῶν τῶν Λευιτῶν, τῶν ἔμπροσθεν τῶν ἀδελφῶν ὑμῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ, ἐν τάξει θύσατε τὸ Πάσχα,
6. καὶ τὰς θυσίας ἑτοιμάσατε τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς ὑμῶν, καὶ ποιήσατε τὸ Πάσχα κατὰ τὸ πρόσταγμα Κυρίου τὸ δοθὲν τῷ Μωϋσῇ.
7. Καὶ ἐδωρήσατο Ἰωσίας τῷ λαῷ τῷ εὑρεθέντι ἀρνῶν καὶ ἐρίφων τριάκοντα χιλιάδας, μόσχους τρισχιλίους. ταῦτα ἐκ τῶν βασιλικῶν ἐδόθη κατ’ ἐπαγγελίαν τῷ λαῷ, καὶ τοῖς ἱερεῦσι, καὶ Λευίταις.
8. Καὶ ἔδωκε Χελκίας, καὶ Ζαχαρίας, καὶ Ἡσυῆλος, οἱ ἐπιστάται τοῦ ἱεροῦ, τοῖς ἱερεῦσιν εἰς Πάσχα πρόβατα δισχίλια ἑξάκοσια, μόσχους τριακοσίους.
9. Καὶ Ἰεχονίας, καὶ Σαμαίας, καὶ Ναθαναὴλ ὁ ἀδελφὸς, καὶ Ἀσαβίας, καὶ Ὀχιλῆλος, καὶ Ἰωρὰμ χιλίαρχοι ἔδωκαν τοῖς Λευίταις εἰς Πάσχα πρόβατα πεντακισχίλια, μόσχους ἑπτακοσίους.
10. καὶ τούτων γενομένων, εὐπρεπῶς ἔστησαν οἱ ἱερεῖς καὶ οἱ Λευῖται, ἔχοντες τὰ ἄζυμα κατὰ τὰς φυλὰς καὶ κατὰ τὰς μεριδαρχίας τῶν πατέρων ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ λαοῦ, προσενεγκεῖν τῷ Κυρίῳ κατὰ τὸ γεγραμμένα.

### THE PRIEST. CHAPTER ONE. I.

**1** And Josiah kept the Passover in Jerusalem unto his own Lord; and the children of Israel sacrificed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.
**2** And he set the priests in their courses, arrayed in their vestments within the temple of the Lord.
**3** And he spake unto the Levites, the sacred ministers of Israel, to sanctify themselves unto the Lord in the place of the holy ark of the Lord, in the house which Solomon, the son of David the king, had built.
**4** Ye shall no longer bear it upon your shoulders; but now serve the Lord your God, and minister unto His nation Israel. And prepare yourselves according to your ancestral houses and your tribes, according to the ordinance of David, king of Israel, and according to the magnificence of Solomon his son.
**5** And stand ye in the sanctuary according to your ancestral divisions as Levites, before your brethren, the sons of Israel; and in order, sacrifice ye the Passover,
**6** and prepare the sacrifices for your brethren, and perform the Passover according to the commandment of the Lord, which was given unto Moses.
**7** And Josiah gave as a gift unto the people who were present, thirty thousand lambs and kids, and three thousand calves. These were given from the royal treasury by promise unto the people, and unto the priests, and [unto the] Levites.
**8** And Hilkiah, and Zechariah, and Hesuel, the overseers of the temple, gave unto the priests for the Passover two thousand and six hundred sheep, and three hundred calves.
**9** And Jechonias, and Samaias, and Nathanael the brother, and Asabias, and Ochilelos, and Ioram, the commanders of a thousand, gave unto the Levites for the Passover five thousand sheep, and seven hundred calves.
**10** And these things being done, the priests and the Levites stood in comely order, having the unleavened [offerings] according to the tribes and according to the ancestral divisions, before the people, to offer unto the Lord according to that which was written.
