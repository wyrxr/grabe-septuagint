19 ἡμῶν; Ἀργύριον τῷ ἀργυρίῳ μὴ φθάσαι, ἀλλὰ περίψημα τοῦ
20 παιδίου ἡμῶν γένοιτο. Ὡς γὰρ δέδοται ἡμῖν ζῆν παρὰ τοῦ Κυ-
21 ρίου, τοῦτο ἱκανὸν ἡμῖν ὑπάρχει. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ Τωβίτ· μὴ λό-
    γον ἔχε, ἀδελφή, ὑγιαίνων ἐλεύσεται, καὶ οἱ ὀφθαλμοί σου ὄ-
22 ψονται αὐτόν. Ἄγγελος γὰρ ἀγαθὸς συμπορεύσεται αὐτῷ, καὶ
    εὐοδωθήσεται ἡ ὁδὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὑποστρέψει ὑγιαίνων.

1.2 ΚΑΙ ἐπαύσατο κλαίουσα. Οἱ δὲ πορευόμενοι τὴν ὁδόν, ἦλθον
3 ἐσπέρας ἐπὶ τὸν Τίγριν ποταμόν, καὶ ηὐλίζοντο ἐκεῖ. Τὸ δὲ παι-
  δάριον κατέβη περικλύσασθαι, καὶ ἀνεπήδησεν ἰχθῦς ἀπὸ τοῦ πο-
  ταμοῦ, καὶ ἐβουλήθη καταπιεῖν τὸ παιδάριον. Ὁ δὲ ἄγγελος εἶ-
4 πεν αὐτῷ· ἐπιλαβοῦ τοῦ ἰχθῦος· καὶ ἐκράτησε τὸν ἰχθῦν τὸ παι-
5 δάριον, καὶ ἀνέβαλεν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ
  ἄγγελος· ἀνάτεμε τὸν ἰχθῦν, καὶ λαβὼν τὴν καρδίαν καὶ τὸ ἧπαρ
6 καὶ τὴν χολήν, θὲς ἀσφαλῶς. Καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ παιδάριον ὡς εἶ-
  πεν αὐτῷ ὁ ἄγγελος· τὸν δὲ ἰχθῦν ὀπτήσαντες, ἔφαγον· καὶ ὤ-
7 δευον ἀμφότεροι, ἕως οὗ ἤγγισαν ἐν Ἐκβατάνοις. Καὶ εἶπε τὸ
  παιδάριον τῷ ἀγγέλῳ· Ἀζαρία ἀδελφέ, τί ἐστι τὸ ἧπαρ καὶ ἡ
8 καρδία καὶ ἡ χολὴ τοῦ ἰχθῦος; Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· ἡ καρδία καὶ
  τὸ ἧπαρ, ἐάν τινα ὀχλῇ δαιμόνιον ἢ πνεῦμα πονηρόν, ταῦτα δεῖ
  καπνίσαι ἐνώπιον ἀνθρώπου, ἢ γυναικός, καὶ οὐκέτι οὐ μὴ ὀ-
9 χληθῇ. Ἡ δὲ χολὴ ἐγχρῖσαι ἄνθρωπον, ὃς ἔχει λεύκωμα ἐν
10 τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς, καὶ ἰαθήσεται. Ὡς δὲ προσήγγισαν τῇ Ῥάγῃ,
11 εἶπεν ὁ ἄγγελος τῷ παιδαρίῳ· ἀδελφέ, σήμερον αὐλισθησόμεθα
   παρὰ Ῥαγουήλ, καὶ αὐτὸς συγγενής σου ἐστίν, καὶ ἔστιν αὐτῷ θυ-
12 γάτηρ μονογενὴς ὀνόματι Σάρῥα. Λαλήσω περὶ αὐτῆς, τοῦ δο-
   θῆναί σοι αὐτὴν εἰς γυναῖκα, ὅτι σοι ἐπιβάλλει ἡ κληρονομία αὐτῆς,
   καὶ σὺ μόνος εἶ ἐκ τοῦ γένους αὐτῆς· καὶ τὸ κοράσιον καλὸν
13 καὶ φρόνιμόν ἐστι. Καὶ νῦν ἄκουσόν μου, καὶ λαλήσω τῷ πατρὶ
   αὐτῆς, καὶ ὅταν ὑποστρέψωμεν ἐκ Ῥαγῶν, ποιήσομεν τὸν γάμον·
   διότι ἐπίσταμαι Ῥαγουὴλ ὅτι οὐ μὴ δῷ αὐτὴν ἀνδρὶ ἑτέρῳ κατὰ
   τὸν νόμον Μωϋσῆ, ἢ ὀφειλήσει θάνατον, ὅτι τὴν κληρονομίαν σοι
14  καθήκει λαβεῖν, ἢ πάντα ἄνθρωπον. Τότε εἶπε τὸ παιδάριον τῷ

[Tobit 5:19]
"May silver not vie with silver; but let our child be [unto us] a precious offering.

[Tobit 5:20]
For as life hath been given us by the Lord, this is sufficient unto us."

[Tobit 5:21]
Then Tobit said unto her, "Have no [such] thought, sister; he shall come in good health, and thine eyes shall behold him.

[Tobit 5:22]
For a good angel shall journey with him, and his way shall be prospered, and he shall return in good health."

### CHAPTER 6

[Tobit 6:1]
And she ceased weeping.

[Tobit 6:2]
As for them, journeying on their way, they came at evening to the river Tigris, and there they lodged.

[Tobit 6:3]
And the boy went down to wash himself, when a fish leaped out of the river and sought to devour the boy. Then the angel said unto him,

[Tobit 6:4]
"Lay hold upon the fish!" And the boy seized the fish and cast it up upon the land.

[Tobit 6:5]
And the angel said unto him, "Cut open the fish, and take the heart, and the liver, and the gall, and place them safely [aside]."

[Tobit 6:6]
And the boy did as the angel commanded him. Then they roasted the fish and ate it. And they journeyed on, both of them, until they drew nigh unto Ecbatana.

[Tobit 6:7]
And the boy said unto the angel, "Azariah, brother, what is the purpose of the liver, and the heart, and the gall of the fish?"

[Tobit 6:8]
And he answered him, "The heart and the liver, if any demon or evil spirit troubleth one, these must be burned as incense before a man or a woman, and he shall by no means be troubled evermore.

[Tobit 6:9]
But the gall is to anoint a man who hath a white film upon his eyes,

[Tobit 6:10]
and he shall be healed." As they drew nigh unto Rages,

[Tobit 6:11]
the angel said unto the boy, "Brother, this day we shall lodge with Raguel, for he is thy kinsman, and he hath a daughter, an only child, named Sarah.

[Tobit 6:12]
I will speak concerning her, that she may be given unto thee to wife; for her inheritance doth fall to thee, and thou alone art of her kin. And the maiden is fair and prudent.

[Tobit 6:13]
Now, therefore, hearken unto me, and I will speak unto her father, and when we shall return from Rages, we will solemnize the marriage. For I know that Raguel will by no means give her to another man according to the Law of Moses, or he shall incur the penalty of death; because the inheritance doth appertain unto thee to take, or else unto any [other] man [of her kin]."

[Tobit 6:14]
Then the boy said unto the angel,
