**2 Maccabees Chapter 10**

**37** εἰσδεξάμενοι δὲ τὴν λοιπὴν τάξιν προκατελάβοντο τὴν πόλιν, καὶ τὸν Τιμόθεον ἀποκεκρυμμένον ἐν τινι λάκκῳ κατέσφαξαν καὶ τὸν τούτου ἀδελφὸν Χαιρέαν καὶ τὸν Ἀπολλοφάνην.
**38** Ταῦτα δὲ διαπραξάμενοι, μεθ᾽ ὕμνων καὶ ἐξομολογήσεως εὐλόγουν τῷ Κυρίῳ τῷ μεγάλως εὐεργετοῦντι τὸν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ τὸ νῖκος αὐτοῖς διδότι.

**Chapter 11**

**1** ΜΕΤ᾽ ὀλίγον δὲ παντελῶς χρόνον Λυσίας ἐπίτροπος τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ συγγενὴς καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν πραγμάτων, λίαν βαρέως
**2** φέρων ἐπὶ τοῖς γεγονόσι, Συναθροίσας περὶ τὰς ὀκτὼ μυριάδας καὶ τὴν ἵππον ἅπασαν, παρεγένετο ἐπὶ τοὺς Ἰουδαίους, λογιζόμενος
**3** τὴν μὲν πόλιν Ἕλλησιν οἰκητήριον ποιήσειν, τὸ δὲ ἱερὸν ἀργυρολόγητον, καθώς τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν ἐθνῶν τεμένη, πρατήν δὲ
**4** κατὰ ἔτος τὴν ἀρχιερωσύνην ποιήσειν. Οὐδαμῶς ἐπιλογιζόμενος τὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ κράτος, πεφρονεμένος δὲ ταῖς μυρίαισι τῶν πεζῶν καὶ ταῖς χιλίσι τῶν ἱππέων καὶ τοῖς ἐλέφασι τοῖς ὀγδοήκοντα.
**5** Εἰσελθὼν δὲ εἰς τὴν Ἰουδαίαν καὶ συνεγγίσας τῷ Βαιθσούρα, ὄντι μὲν ἐρυμνῷ χωρίῳ, Ἱεροσολύμων δὲ ἀπέχοντι ὡσεὶ σχοίνους
**6** πέντε, τοῦτο ἔθλιβεν. Ὡς δὲ μετέλαβον οἱ περὶ τὸν Μακκαβαῖον πολιορκοῦντα αὐτὸν τὰ ὀχυρώματα, μετὰ ὀδυρμῶν καὶ δακρύων ἱκέτευον σὺν τοῖς ὄχλοις τὸν Κύριον ἀγαθὸν ἄγγελον
**7** ἀποστεῖλαι πρὸς σωτηρίαν τῷ Ἰσραήλ. Αὐτὸς δὲ ὁ Μακκαβαῖος πρῶτος ἀναλαβὼν τὰ ὅπλα προετρέψατο τοὺς ἄλλους, ἅμα αὐτῷ διακινδυνεύοντας ἐπιβοηθεῖν τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς αὑτῶν· ὁμοῦ δὲ
**8** καὶ προθύμως ἐξώρμησαν. Αὐτόθι δὲ πρὸς τοῖς Ἱεροσολύμοις ὄντων, ἐφάνη προηγούμενος αὐτῶν ἔφιππος ἐν λευκῇ ἐσθῆτι πανοπλίαν χρυσῆν κραδαίνων.
**9** Ὁμοῦ δὲ πάντες εὐλόγησαν τὸν ἐλεήμονα Θεόν, καὶ ἐπερρώσθησαν ταῖς ψυχαῖς, οὐ μόνον ἀνθρώπους ἀλλὰ καὶ θῆρας (δὲ) τοὺς ἀγριωτάτους καὶ σιδηρᾶ τείχη τιτρώσκειν ὄντες ἕτοιμοι,
**10** προῆγον ἐν διασκευῇ τὸν ἀπ᾽ οὐρανοῦ σύμμαχον ἔχοντες ἐλεήσαντος αὐτοὺς τοῦ Κυρίου.
**11** Λεοντηδὸν δὲ ἐντινάξαντες εἰς τοὺς πολεμίους, κατέστρωσαν αὐτῶν χιλίους πρὸς τοῖς μυρίοις, ἱππεῖς δὲ ἑξακοσίους πρὸς χιλίοις· τοὺς δὲ πάντας
**12** ἠνάγκασαν φεύγειν. Οἱ πλείονες δὲ αὐτῶν τραυματίαι γυμνοὶ διεσώθησαν· καὶ αὐτὸς δὲ ὁ Λυσίας αἰσχρῶς φεύγων διεσώθη.

**2 Maccabees Chapter 10**

**37** And having received the rest of the ranks, they did occupy the city before [them], and they slaughtered Timothy, who was hidden in a certain pit, and his brother Chaereas, and Apollophanes.
**38** And having accomplished these things, with hymns and confession they did bless the Lord, who greatly did benefit Israel, and did give unto them the victory.

**Chapter 11**

**1** Now after a very short time, Lysias, the king's regent and kinsman, and [one] over affairs, bearing very grievously
**2** the things that had come to pass, having gathered about eighty thousand [men] and all the cavalry, came against the Jews,
**3** calculating that he would make the city a dwelling for Greeks, and the temple a source of tribute, as [are] the sanctuaries of the other nations, and that he would make
**4** the high priesthood for sale yearly. In no wise reckoning the power of God, but trusting in the ten thousands of infantry and the thousands of horsemen and the eighty elephants.
**5** And having entered into Judea and drawn near unto Beth-zur, which was a strong place, and distant from Jerusalem about five schoeni,
**6** he did distress this [place]. And when they that were about Maccabeus perceived that he was besieging the strongholds, with lamentations and tears they supplicated with the multitudes the Lord to send a good angel
**7** for salvation unto Israel. And Maccabeus himself, first taking up arms, exhorted the others, who were risking their lives with him, to come to the aid of their brethren; and with one accord,
**8** and eagerly they went forth. And while they were there near Jerusalem, there appeared before them a horseman in white apparel, shaking golden armor.
**9** And all together blessed the merciful God, and were strengthened in their souls, being ready to wound not only men, but also [indeed] the fiercest beasts and walls of iron,
**10** they went forth in array, having the ally from heaven, for the Lord had had mercy upon them.
**11** And having charged into the enemies like lions, they laid low of them eleven thousand, and one thousand six hundred horsemen; and they compelled them all
**12** to flee. And most of them, wounded and naked, escaped; and Lysias himself also escaped, fleeing shamefully.
