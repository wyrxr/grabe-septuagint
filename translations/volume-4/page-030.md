τοῦ ὄρους, καὶ ἀπώχοντο πρὸς τὸν κύριον αὐτῶν. Καταβάντες         14
δὲ οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐκ τῆς πόλεως αὐτῶν ἐπέστησαν ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸν,
καὶ λύσαντες αὐτὸν ἐπήγαγον εἰς τὴν Βετυλούα, καὶ κατέστησαν
αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τοὺς ἄρχοντας τῆς πόλεως αὐτῶν, οἳ ἦσαν ἐν ταῖς ἡ-         15
μέραις ἐκείναις, Ὀζίας ὁ τοῦ Μιχὰ ἐκ τῆς φυλῆς Συμεὼν, καὶ
Χαβρεὶς ὁ τοῦ Γοθονιὴλ, καὶ Χαρμεὶς υἱὸς Μελιχιήλ. Καὶ συνε-         16

πᾶς νεανίσκος αὐτῶν καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες εἰς τὴν ἐκκλησίαν, καὶ ἔστη-
σαν τὸν Ἀχιὼρ ἐν μέσῳ παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπηρώτησεν
αὐτὸν Ὀζίας τὸ συμβεβηκός. Καὶ ἀποκριθεὶς ἀπήγγειλεν αὐτοῖς         17
τὰ ῥήματα τῆς συνεδρίας Ὁλοφέρνου, καὶ πάντα τὰ ῥήματα ὅσα
ἐλάλησεν ἐν μέσῳ τῶν ἀρχόντων υἱῶν Ἀσσούρ, καὶ ὅσα ἐμεγαλο-
ρημόνησεν Ὁλοφέρνης εἰς τὸν οἶκον Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ πεσόντες ὁ         18
λαὸς προσεκύνησαν τῷ Θεῷ, καὶ ἐβόησαν, λέγοντες· Κύριε ὁ         19
Θεὸς τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, κάτειδε ἐπὶ τὰς ὑπερηφανείας αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐ-
λέησον τὴν ταπείνωσιν τοῦ γένους ἡμῶν, καὶ ἐπίβλεψον ἐπὶ τὸ
πρόσωπον τῶν ἡγιασμένων σοι ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ταύτῃ. Καὶ παρεκά-         20
λεσαν τὸν Ἀχιώρ, καὶ ἐπήνεσαν αὐτὸν σφόδρα. Καὶ παρέλαβεν         21
αὐτὸν Ὀζίας ἐκ τῆς ἐκκλησίας εἰς οἶκον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐποίησε πότον τοῖς πρεσβυτέροις· καὶ ἐπεκαλέσαντο τὸν Θεὸν Ἰσραὴλ εἰς
βοήθειαν, ὅλην τὴν νύκτα ἐκείνην.

ἀποσκευῆς, καὶ τῶν ἀνδρῶν, οἳ ἦσαν πεζοὶ ἐν αὐτοῖς, πλῆθος πο-

#### CHAPTER 6

12 cast stones upon them. And withdrawing, they bound Achior and left him cast down at the foot of the mountain; and they went away unto their lord.

17 And they comforted Achior and praised him exceedingly. And Uzziah received him from the assembly into his house and made a feast for the elders; and they called upon the God of Israel for help all that night.
