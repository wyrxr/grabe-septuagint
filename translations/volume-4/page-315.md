                 ἕκαστος τῷ αὐτοῦ ὀνόματι, ὅσων οὐκ ἐξεπόρνευσεν ἡ καρδία, καὶ
                 ὅσοι οὐκ ἀπεστράφησαν ἀπὸ Κυρίου, εἴη τὸ μνημόσυνον αὐτῶν
12             ἐν εὐλογίαις· τὰ ὀστᾶ αὐτῶν ἀναβάλοι ἐκ τοῦ τόπου αὐτῶν, καὶ
                 τὸ ὄνομα αὐτῶν ἀντικαταλλασσόμενον, ἐφ᾽ υἱοῖς δεδοξασμένων
13             αὐτῶν. Ἠγαπημένος ὑπὸ κυρίου αὐτοῦ Σαμουὴλ προφήτης Κυ-
                 ρίου κατέστησε βασιλείαν, καὶ ἔχρισεν ἄρχοντας ἐπὶ τὸν λαὸν
14             αὐτοῦ· ἐν νόμῳ Κυρίου ἔκρινε συναγωγήν, καὶ ἐπεσκέψατο Κύ-
15             ριος τὸν Ἰακώβ. Ἐν πίστει αὐτοῦ ἠκριβάσθη προφήτης, καὶ ἐγνώ-
16             σθη ἐν ῥήμασιν αὐτοῦ πιστὸς ὁράσεως. Καὶ ἐπεκαλέσατο τὸν Κύ-
                 ριον δυνάστην, ἐν τῷ θλίψαι ἐχθροὺς αὐτοῦ κυκλόθεν, ἐν προσφορᾷ
17             ἀρνὸς γαλαθηνοῦ· καὶ ἐβρόντησεν ἀπ᾽ οὐρανοῦ Κύριος, καὶ ἐν ἤχῳ
18             μεγάλῳ ἀκουστὴν ἐποίησε τὴν φωνὴν αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐξέτριψεν ἡγου-
19             μένους Τυρίων, καὶ πάντας ἄρχοντας Φυλιστιείμ. Καὶ πρὸ και-
                 ροῦ κοιμήσεως αἰῶνος ἐπεμαρτύρατο ἔναντι Κυρίου καὶ χριστοῦ·
                 χρήματα καὶ ἕως ὑποδημάτων ἀπὸ πάσης σαρκὸς οὐκ εἴληφα· καὶ
20             οὐκ ἐνεκάλεσεν αὐτῷ ἄνθρωπος. Καὶ μετὰ τὸ ὑπνῶσαι αὐτὸν ἐ-
                 προφήτευσε, καὶ ὑπέδειξε βασιλεῖ τὴν τελευτὴν αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἀνύ-
                 ψωσεν ἐκ γῆς φωνὴν αὐτοῦ, ἐν προφητείᾳ ἐξαλεῖψαι ἀνομίαν λαοῦ.

                 γίγαντα, καὶ ἐξῆρεν ὀνειδισμὸν ἐκ λαοῦ, ἐν τῷ ἐπάραι χεῖρα ἐν
5              λίθῳ σφενδόνης, καὶ καταβαλεῖν γαυρίαμα τοῦ Γολιάθ; Ἐπε-

**Chapter Forty-Six**

11 Each one by his own name,
Whose heart did not stray,
And who turned not away from the Lord:
May their memorial be in blessings.
12 May their bones spring forth from their resting place,
And their name be recompensed by their glorified sons.
13 Beloved of his Lord was Samuel, a prophet of the Lord,
Who established a kingdom and anointed rulers over His people.
14 By the law of the Lord did he judge the assembly,
And the Lord visited Jacob.
15 In his faithfulness was he made an accurate prophet,
And was known in his words [as] a faithful seer of visions.
16 And he called upon the Lord, the Mighty One,
When his enemies oppressed him round about,
With the offering of a suckling lamb.
17 And the Lord thundered from heaven,
And with a great sound made His voice to be heard.
18 And He utterly crushed the rulers of Tyre,
And all the princes of the Philistines.
19 And before the time of his eternal rest,
He testified before the Lord and His Anointed One, [saying]:
"Neither silver nor even shoes have I taken from any person."
And no man made accusation against him.
20 And after he fell asleep, he prophesied,
And showed the king his end;
And he raised his voice from the earth,
In prophecy, to blot out the iniquity of the people.

**Chapter Forty-Seven**

1 And after him arose Nathan,
Prophesying in the days of David.
2 As fat set apart from a peace offering,
So was David among the sons of Israel.
3 Among lions he played as among kids,
And among bears as among lambs of the flock.
4 In his youth, did he not slay a giant,
And remove reproach from the people,
By lifting his hand with a sling stone,
5 And casting down the pride of Goliath?
For he called upon the Lord Most High,
And He gave strength into his right hand,
To bring down a man mighty in war,
To exalt the horn of His people.
6 Thus in ten thousands did He glorify him,
And led him in the blessings of the Lord,
When a diadem of glory was borne upon him.
7 For he utterly crushed his enemies round about,
And brought to naught the Philistines, his adversaries;
8 Even unto this day did he crush their horn.
In every work of his, he gave praise to the Holy Most High,
With a word of glory;
9 With all his heart he hymned,
And loved Him who made him.
And he set up psalm-singers before the altar,
And from the sound of their [voices]...
