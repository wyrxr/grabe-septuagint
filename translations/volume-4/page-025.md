3 προσώπῳ σου. Ἰδοὺ αἱ ἐπαύλεις ἡμῶν, καὶ πᾶς τόπος ἡμῶν, καὶ
πᾶν πεδίον πυρῶν, καὶ τὰ ποίμνια καὶ τὰ βουκόλια, καὶ πᾶσαι
αἱ μάνδραι τῶν σκηνῶν ἡμῶν παράκεινται πρὸ προσώπου σου,
4 χρῆσαι καθ’ ὃ ἂν ἀρέσκῃ σοι. Ἰδοὺ καὶ αἱ πόλεις ἡμῶν, καὶ οἱ
κατοικοῦντες ἐν αὐταῖς δοῦλοί σου εἰσίν· ἐλθὼν ἀπάντησον αὐταῖς
5 ὡς ἔστιν ἀγαθὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς σου. Καὶ παρεγένοντο οἱ ἄνδρες
πρὸς Ὁλοφέρνην, καὶ ἀπήγγειλαν αὐτῷ κατὰ τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα.
6 Καὶ κατέβη ἐπὶ τὴν παραλίαν αὐτὸς καὶ ἡ δύναμις αὐτοῦ, καὶ
ἐφρούρησε τὰς πόλεις τὰς ὑψηλάς, καὶ ἔλαβεν ἐξ αὐτῶν εἰς συμ-
7 μαχίαν ἄνδρας ἐπιλέκτους. Καὶ ἐδέξαντο αὐτὸν αὐτοί, καὶ πᾶσα
ἡ περίχωρος αὐτῶν, μετὰ στεφάνων καὶ χορῶν καὶ τυμπάνων.
8 Καὶ κατέσκαψε πάντα τὰ ὅρια αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰ ἄλση αὐτῶν ἐξέκοψε.
καὶ ἦν δεδογμένον αὐτῷ ἐξολοθρεῦσαι πάντας τοὺς θεοὺς
τῆς γῆς, ὅπως αὐτῷ μόνῳ τῷ Ναβουχοδονόσορ λατρεύσῃ πάντα
τὰ ἔθνη, καὶ πᾶσαι αἱ γλῶσσαι καὶ πᾶσαι αἱ φυλαὶ αὐτῶν ἐ-
9 πικαλέσωνται αὐτὸν εἰς Θεόν. Καὶ ἦλθε κατὰ πρόσωπον Ἐσδρη-
λὼν πλησίον τῆς Δωταίας, ᾗ ἐστιν ἀπέναντι τοῦ πρίονος τοῦ
10 μεγάλου τῆς Ἰουδαίας· καὶ κατεστρατοπέδευσεν ἀναμέσον Γαβαὶ
καὶ Σκυθῶν πόλεως, καὶ ἦν ἐκεῖ μῆνα ἡμερῶν εἰς τὸ συλλέξαι
πᾶσαν τὴν ἀπαρτίαν τῆς δυνάμεως αὐτοῦ.

1 ΚΑΙ ἤκουσαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ οἱ κατοικοῦντες ἐν τῇ Ἰουδαίᾳ
πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν Ὁλοφέρνης τοῖς ἔθνεσιν, ὁ ἀρχιστράτηγος Να-
βουχοδονόσορ βασιλέως Ἀσσυρίων, καὶ ὃν τρόπον ἐσκύλευσε πάν-
2 τα τὰ ἱερὰ αὐτῶν, καί ἔδωκεν αὐτὰ εἰς ἀφανισμόν· καὶ ἐφοβήθη-
σαν σφόδρα σφόδρα ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ, καὶ περὶ Ἱερουσαλὴμ
3 καὶ τοῦ ναοῦ Κυρίου Θεοῦ αὐτῶν ἐταράχθησαν. Ὅτι προσφάτως
ἦσαν ἀναβεβηκότες ἐκ τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας, καὶ νεωστὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς
συνελέλεκτο τῆς Ἰουδαίας, καὶ τὰ σκεύη, καὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον,
4 καὶ ὁ οἶκος, ἐκ τῆς βεβηλώσεως ἡγιασμένα ἦν. Καὶ ἀπέστειλαν εἰς
πᾶν ὅριον Σαμαρείας, καὶ Κωνὰς, καὶ Βαιθωρῶν, καὶ Βελμαΐν,
καὶ Ἰεριχώ, καὶ εἰς Χωβά, καὶ Αἰσωρὰ, καὶ τὸν αὐλῶνα Σαλὴμ,
5 καὶ προκατελάβοντο πάσας τὰς κορυφὰς τῶν ὀρέων τῶν ὑψηλῶν,
καὶ ἐτείχισαν τὰς ἐν αὐτοῖς κώμας, καὶ παρεθέντο εἰς ἐπισιτι-

#### CHAPTER 3

3 in thy sight. Behold, our homesteads, and all our lands, and every field of wheat, and the flocks and the herds, and all the folds of our tents lie before thy face;
4 use [them] as it shall please thee. Behold, even our cities, and they that dwell therein, are thy servants; come thou and meet them
5 as it is good in thine eyes." And the men came unto Holofernes, and declared unto him according to these words.
6 And he himself, and his host, went down unto the seacoast, and garrisoned the high cities, and took from them chosen men for an alliance.
7 And they themselves, and all their country round about, received him with crowns, and with dances, and with timbrels.
8 And he tore down all their borders, and cut down their groves. And it was purposed in his heart utterly to destroy all the gods of the earth, that all the nations should serve Nebuchadnezzar, him only, and that all their tongues and all their tribes should call upon him as God.
9 And he came over against Esdraelon, nigh unto Dotaias, which is over against the great saw of Judea;
10 and he encamped between Gabai and the city of Scythians; and he was there a month of days, to gather together all the full number of his host.

#### CHAPTER 4

1 Now when the children of Israel, who dwelt in Judea, heard all that Holofernes had done unto the nations, he being the chief captain of Nebuchadnezzar, king of the Assyrians, and in what wise he had spoiled all their holy places,
2 and had given them over unto utter destruction; and they were sore afraid, yea, exceeding sore afraid, by reason of him; and concerning Jerusalem and the Temple of the Lord their God, they were greatly troubled.
3 For but lately had they come up from the captivity, and newly had all the people of Judea been gathered together; and the vessels, and the altar, and the house, had been sanctified from their defilement.
4 And they sent forth unto every border of Samaria, and unto Konas, and Bethoron, and Belmain, and Jericho, and unto Choba, and Aisor, and the valley of Salem,
5 and they seized beforehand all the tops of the high mountains, and fortified the villages that were therein, and laid up provisions.
