ΚΕΦ. Ζ΄.

ΣΥΝΕΒΗ δὲ καὶ ἑπτὰ ἀδελφοὺς μετὰ τῆς μητρὸς συλληφθέν- 1
τας ἀναγκάζεσθαι ὑπὸ τοῦ βασιλέως ἀπὸ τῶν ἀθεμίτων ὑείων κρεῶν
ἐφάπτεσθαι μάστιξι καὶ νευραῖς αἰκιζομένους. Εἷς δὲ αὐτῶν γε- 2
νόμενος πρόγορος εἶπε· τί μέλλεις ἐρωτᾶν καὶ μανθάνειν παρ᾿ ἡ-
μῶν; ἕτοιμοι γὰρ ἀποθνήσκειν ἐσμὲν ἢ πατρῴους νόμους παραβαί-
νειν. Ἔκθυμος δὲ γενόμενος ὁ βασιλεὺς προσέταξε τήγανα καὶ 3
λέβητας ἐκπυροῦν. Τῶν δὲ παραχρῆμα ἐκπυρωθέντων, τὸν γε- 4
νόμενον αὐτῶν πρόγορον προσέταξε γλωσσοτομεῖν, καὶ περισκυ-
θίσαντας ἀκρωτηριάζειν, τῶν λοιπῶν ἀδελφῶν καὶ τῆς μητρὸς συ-
νορώντων. Ἄχρηστον δὲ αὐτὸν τοῖς ὅλως γενόμενον ἐκέλευσε τῇ 5
πυρᾷ προσάγειν ἔμπνουν καὶ τηγανίζειν· τῆς δὲ ἀτμίδος ἐφ᾿ ἵκα-
νὸν διαδιδούσης τοῦ τηγάνου ἀλλήλους παρεκάλουν σὺν τῇ μητρὶ
γενναίως τελευτᾶν, λέγοντες οὕτως. Ὁ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἐφορᾷ, καὶ 6
ταῖς ἀληθείαις ἐφ᾿ ἡμῖν παρακαλεῖται, καθάπερ διὰ τῆς κατὰ πρό-
σωπον ἀντιμαρτυρούσης ᾠδῆς διεσάφησε Μωσῆς, λέγων· καὶ ἐπὶ
7 τοῖς δούλοις αὐτοῦ παρακληθήσεται. Μεταλλάξαντος δὲ τοῦ πρώτου
τὸν τρόπον τοῦτον, τὸν δεύτερον ἦγον ἐπὶ τὸν ἐμπαιγμὸν καὶ
τὸ τῆς κεφαλῆς δέρμα σὺν ταῖς θριξὶ περισύροντες ἐπηρώτων, εἰ
8 φάγεσαι πρὸ τοῦ τιμωρηθῆναι κατὰ μέλος τὸ σῶμα; Ὁ δὲ ἀποκριθεὶς
τῇ πατρίῳ φωνῇ προσείπεν· οὐχί. διόπερ καὶ οὗτος τὴν
9 ἑξῆς ἔλαβε βάσανον, ὡς ὁ πρῶτος. Ἐν ἐσχάτῃ δὲ πνοῇ γενόμενος
εἶπε· σὺ μὲν ἀλάστωρ ἐκ τοῦ παρόντος ἡμᾶς ζῆν ἀπολύεις,
ὁ δὲ τοῦ κόσμου βασιλεὺς ἀποθανόντας ἡμᾶς ὑπὲρ τῶν αὐτοῦ νόμων
εἰς αἰώνιον ἀναβίωσιν ζωῆς ἡμᾶς ἀναστήσει. 10 Μετὰ δὲ τοῦτον
ὁ τρίτος ἐνεπαίζετο, καὶ τὴν γλῶσσαν αἰτηθεὶς ταχέως προσέβαλλε,
11 καὶ τὰς χεῖρας εὐθαρσῶς προέτεινε, καὶ γενναίως εἶπεν·
ἐξ οὐρανοῦ ταῦτα κέκτημαι, καὶ διὰ τοὺς αὐτοῦ νόμους ὑπερορῶ
12 ταῦτα, καὶ παρ᾿ αὐτοῦ ταῦτα πάλιν ἐλπίζω κομίζεσθαι. Ὥστε
αὐτὸν τὸν βασιλέα καὶ τοὺς σὺν αὐτῷ ἐκπλήσσεσθαι τὴν τοῦ νεανίσκου
13 ψυχὴν, ὡς ἐν οὐδενὶ τὰς ἀλγηδόνας ἐτίθετο. Καὶ τούτου
δὲ μεταλλάξαντος τὸν τέταρτον ὡσαύτως ἐβασάνιζον αἰκιζόμενοι.
14 Καὶ γενόμενος πρὸς τῷ τελευταῖν οὕτως ἔφη· αἱρετὸν μεταλλάσσοντας
ἀπὸ ἀνθρώπων τὰς ὑπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ προσδοκᾶν ἐλπίδας πάλιν
ἀναστήσεσθαι ὑπ᾿ αὐτοῦ· σοὶ μὲν γὰρ ἀνάστασις εἰς ζωὴν οὐκ ἔσται.
15 Ἐχομένως δὲ τὸν πέμπτον προσάγοντες ᾐκίζοντο. 16 Ὁ δὲ πρὸς
αὐτὸν εἰδὼν, εἶπεν· ἐξουσίαν ἐν ἀνθρώποις ἔχων, ὃ θέλεις, ποιεῖς,
φθαρτὸς ὢν· μὴ δόκει δὲ τὸ γένος ἡμῶν ὑπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ καταλελείφθαι.
17 Σὺ δὲ καρτέρει, καὶ θεώρει τὸ μεγαλεῖον αὐτοῦ κράτος,
18 ὡς σὲ καὶ τὸ σπέρμα σου βασανιεῖ. Μετὰ δὲ τοῦτον ἦγον
τὸν ἕκτον, καὶ μέλλων ἀποθνήσκειν ἔφη· μὴ πλανῶ μάτην, ἡμεῖς
γὰρ δι᾿ ἑαυτοὺς ταῦτα πάσχομεν ἁμαρτόντες εἰς ἑαυτὸν
19 Θεὸν, διὸ ἄξια θαυμασμοῦ γέγονε. Σὺ δὲ μὴ νομίσης ἀθῷος
20 ἔσεσθαι θεομαχεῖν ἐπιχειρήσας. Ὑπεραγόντως δὲ ἡ μήτηρ θαυμαστὴ
καὶ μνήμης ἀγαθῆς ἀξία, ἥτις ἀπολλυμένους υἱοὺς ἑπτὰ
συνορῶσα μιᾶς ὑπὸ καιρὸν ἡμέρας εὐψύχως ἔφερε διὰ τὰς ἐπὶ
21 Κύριον ἐλπίδας. Ἕκαστον δὲ αὐτῶν παρεκάλει τῇ πατρίῳ φωνῇ,
γενναίῳ πεπληρωμένη φρονήματι, καὶ τὸν θῆλυν λογισμὸν ἄρσενι
22 θυμῷ διεγείρασα, λέγουσα πρὸς αὐτούς. Οὐκ οἶδ᾿ ὅπως εἰς τὴν
ἐμὴν ἐφάνητε κοιλίαν, οὐδὲ ἐγὼ τὸ πνεῦμα καὶ τὴν ζωὴν ὑμῖν
ἐχαρισάμην, καὶ τὴν ἑκάστου στοιχείωσιν οὐκ ἐγὼ διερόμισα.

#### CHAPTER VII.

**6** ...face-to-face did Moses make clear through the song that bore witness, saying, "And He shall be appeased concerning His servants."

**7** And when the first had departed in this wise, they led the second unto the mockery. And having stripped off the skin of his head with the hairs, they asked, saying, "Wilt thou eat, ere thy body be punished limb by limb?" **8** But he answered in the tongue of his fathers, saying, "Nay." Wherefore, this man also received the next torment, even as the first. **9** And being in his last breath, he said, "Thou, indeed, accursed one, dost release us from this present life; but the King of the world, for the sake of His laws, shall raise us up, who have died, unto an everlasting renewal of life."

**10** And after him, the third was mocked; and when his tongue was demanded, he quickly put it forth, and bravely stretched out his hands, and nobly said, **11** "From Heaven have I received these [limbs], and for the sake of His laws do I despise them, and from Him again do I hope to receive them." **12** So that the king himself, and they that were with him, were astonished at the young man's spirit, how he reckoned the pains as naught.

**13** And when this man also had departed, they tortured the fourth in like manner, tormenting him. **14** And being about to die, he thus spake: "It is better, that we, departing from among men, should expect the hopes of God, that we shall again be raised up by Him; for unto thee there shall be no resurrection to life."

**15** And next, bringing forth the fifth, they tormented him. **16** And he, looking upon him, said, "Having power among men, thou doest what thou wilt, for thou art corruptible; but think not that our race hath been forsaken by God. **17** But do thou endure, and behold His great might, how He shall torment thee and thy seed."

**18** And after him, they brought the sixth; and being about to die, he said, "Be not deceived in vain; for we suffer these things for our own sakes, having sinned against God Himself; wherefore, these things are come to pass, worthy of wonder. **19** But think not that thou shalt be innocent, having attempted to fight against God."

**20** But the mother was exceedingly wonderful and worthy of good memory, who, beholding her seven sons perishing in the compass of one day, did bravely endure by reason of her hopes in the Lord. **21** And she exhorted each one of them in the tongue of their fathers, being filled with a noble spirit, and having stirred up her feminine reasoning with masculine courage, saying unto them, **22** "I know not how ye came into my womb, neither did I grant unto you spirit and life, nor did I combine the elements of each one of you."
