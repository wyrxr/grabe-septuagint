ΚΕΦ. Θʹ. Ιʹ.
νῦν εἶ Θεὸς, ἐλαττόνων εἶ βοηθὸς, ἀντιλήπτωρ ἀσθενούντων, ἀπεγνωσμένων
12 σκεπαστὴς, ἀπηλπισμένων σωτήρ. Ναὶ ναὶ ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ πατρός μου, καὶ Θεὸς
κληρονομίας Ἰσραὴλ, δέσποτα τῶν οὐρανῶν καὶ τῆς γῆς, κτίστα τῶν ὑδάτων,
βασιλεῦ πάσης κτίσεώς
13 σου, σὺ εἰσάκουσον τῆς δεήσεώς μου, καὶ δὸς λόγον μου καὶ ἀπάτην εἰς τραῦμα
καὶ μώλωπα αὐτῶν, οἳ κατὰ τῆς διαθήκης σου, καὶ οἴκου ἡγιασμένου σου, καὶ
κορυφῆς Σιὼν, καὶ οἴκου
14 κατασχέσεως υἱῶν σου ἐβουλεύσαντο σκληρά. Καὶ ποίησον ἐπὶ παντὸς ἔθνους
σου καὶ πάσης φυλῆς ἐπίγνωσιν, τοῦ εἰδῆσαι ὅτι σὺ εἶ ὁ Θεὸς Θεὸς πάσης
δυνάμεως καὶ κράτους, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἄλλος ὑπερασπίζων τοῦ γένους Ἰσραὴλ, εἰ
μὴ σύ.

ΚΕΦ. Ιʹ.
1 ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο ὡς ἐπαύσατο βοῶσα πρὸς τὸν Θεὸν Ἰσραὴλ,
2 καὶ συνετέλεσε πάντα τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα, καὶ ἀνέστη ἀπὸ τῆς πτώσεως, καὶ
ἐκάλεσε τὴν ἄβραν αὐτῆς, καὶ κατέβη εἰς τὸν οἶκον ἐν ᾧ διέτριβεν ἐν αὐτῷ ἐν
ταῖς ἡμέραις τῶν σαββάτων, καὶ ἐν
3 ταῖς ἑορταῖς αὐτῆς, καὶ περιείλατο τὸν σάκκον ὃν ἐνεδιδύσκετο, καὶ ἐξεδύσατο
τὰ ἱμάτια τῆς χηρεύσεως αὐτῆς, καὶ περιεκλύσατο τὸ σῶμα ὕδατι, καὶ ἐχρίσατο
μύρῳ παχεῖ, καὶ διέταξε τὰς τρίχας τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐπέθετο μίτραν ἐπ᾿
αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐνεδύσατο τὰ ἱμάτια τῆς εὐφροσύνης αὐτῆς, ἐν οἷς ἐστολίζετο ἐν ταῖς
ἡμέραις τῆς ζωῆς τοῦ ἀνδρὸς αὐτῆς Μανασσῆ.
4 Καὶ ἔλαβε σανδάλια εἰς τοὺς πόδας αὐτῆς, καὶ περιέθετο τοὺς χλιδῶνας καὶ τὰ
ψέλλια, καὶ τοὺς δακτυλίους, καὶ τὰ ἐνώτια, καὶ πάντα τὸν κόσμον αὐτῆς, καὶ
ἐκαλλωπίσατο σφόδρα εἰς ἀπάτησιν
5 ὀφθαλμῶν ἀνδρῶν, ὅσοι ἂν ἴδωσιν αὐτήν. Καὶ ἔδωκε τῇ ἄβρα αὐτῆς
ἀσκοπυτίνην οἴνου, καὶ καζάκην ἐλαίου, καὶ πῆραν ἐπλήρωσεν ἀλφίτων καὶ
παλάθης καὶ ἄρτων καθαρῶν, καὶ περιεδίπλωσε πάντα τὰ ἀγγεῖα αὐτῆς, καὶ
ἐπέθηκεν αὐτῇ.
6 Καὶ ἐξῆλθοσαν ἐπὶ τὴν πύλην τῆς πόλεως Βετυλούα, καὶ εὕροσαν ἐφεστῶτα
αὐτῇ Ὀζίαν, καὶ τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους τῆς πόλεως, Χαβρεὶν καὶ
7 Χαρμείν. Ὡς δὲ εἶδον αὐτὴν, καὶ ἦν ἠλλοιωμένον τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτῆς, καὶ τὴν
στολὴν μεταβεβληκυῖαν αὐτῆς, ἐθαύμασαν ἐπὶ
8 τῷ κάλλει αὐτῆς ἐπὶ πολὺ σφόδρα, καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῇ· Ὁ Θεὸς ὁ

#### CHAPTER 9 (continuation)

**11** Now art Thou God, a helper of the lowly, a defender of the weak, a protector of them that despair, and a saviour of the hopeless.
**12** Verily, verily, O God of my father, and God of the inheritance of Israel, O Master of the heavens and of the earth, O Creator of the waters, O King of all Thy creation!
**13** Do Thou hearken unto my supplication, and grant my word and my deceit unto the wounding and the bruising of them, even of those who against Thy covenant, and against Thy hallowed house, and against the summit of Zion, and against the house of possession of Thy sons, have devised harsh things.
**14** And cause Thou upon all Thy nation and every tribe a knowing, that they may know that Thou art God, yea God, of all power and might, and there is none other that shieldeth the race of Israel, save Thee alone.

#### CHAPTER 10

**1** And it came to pass, when she ceased crying out unto the God of Israel,
**2** and had completed all these words, that she arose from her prostration, and called her handmaid, and went down into the house wherein she abode in the days of the sabbaths, and in
**3** her feast days. And she removed the sackcloth which she had worn, and she put off the garments of her widowhood, and washed her body with water, and anointed herself with rich perfume, and arranged the hair of her head, and placed a turban upon it, and put on the garments of her gladness, wherein she used to array herself in the days of the life of her husband Manasseh.
**4** And she took sandals for her feet, and put on her anklets and her bracelets, and her rings, and her earrings, and all her adornments; and she beautified herself exceedingly for the deceiving
**5** of the eyes of men, even as many as should see her. And she gave to her handmaid a skin-bottle of wine, and a flask of oil; and she filled a wallet with parched corn, and date-cakes, and pure loaves; and she wrapped up all her vessels, and laid them upon her.
**6** And they went forth unto the gate of the city of Bethulia, and found Ozias, and the elders of the city, Chabris and
**7** Charmis, standing by it. And when they saw her, and her countenance was altered, and her raiment changed, they marvelled at her beauty exceedingly greatly,
**8** and said unto her: "The God, the [God of our fathers, grant unto thee grace]..."
