τριῶν καὶ πεντακισχιλίων τῇ τοῦ Θεοῦ μεγάλως εὐφρανθέντες
ἐπιφανείᾳ. Γενόμενοι δὲ ἀπὸ τῆς χρείας, καὶ μετὰ χαρᾶς ἀνα- 28
λύοντες, ἐπέγνωσαν προπεπτωκότα Νικάνορα σὺν τῇ πανοπλίᾳ.
Γενομένης δὲ κραυγῆς καὶ ταραχῆς, εὐλόγουν τὸν δυνάστην τῇ 29
πατρίῳ φωνῇ. Καὶ προσέταξεν ὁ καθ' ἅπαν σώματι καὶ ψυχῇ 30
πρωταγωνιστὴς ὑπὲρ τῶν πολιτῶν, ὁ τὴν τῆς ἡλικίας εὔνοιαν
εἰς ὁμοεθνεῖς διαφυλάξας, τὴν τοῦ Νικάνορος κεφαλὴν ἀπο-
τεμόντας, καὶ τὴν χεῖρα σὺν τῷ ὤμῳ, περιφέρειν εἰς Ἱερο-
σόλυμα. Παραγενόμενος δὲ ἐκεῖ, καὶ συγκαλεσάμενος τοὺς ὁμοε- 31
θνεῖς, καὶ τοὺς ἱερεῖς πρὸ τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου στήσας, μετεπέμ-
ψατο τοὺς ἐκ τῆς ἄκρας. Καὶ ἐπιδειξάμενος τὴν τοῦ μιαροῦ 32
Νικάνορος κεφαλὴν καὶ τὴν χεῖρα τοῦ δυσφήμου, ἣν ἐκτείνας ἐπὶ
τὸν ἅγιον τοῦ παντοκράτορος οἶκον ἐμεγαλαύχησε, καὶ τὴν γλῶσ- 33
σαν τοῦ δυσσεβοῦς Νικάνορος ἐκτεμών, ἔφη μετὰ μέρος δώσειν
τοῖς ὀρνέοις, τὰ δ᾿ ἐπίχειρα τῆς ἀνοίας κατέναντι τοῦ ναοῦ κρε-
μάσαι. Οἱ δὲ πάντες εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν εὐλόγησαν τὸν ἐπιφανῆ 34
Κύριον, λέγοντες· εὐλογητὸς ὁ διατηρήσας τὸν ἑαυτοῦ τόπον
ἀμίαντον. Ἐξέδησε δὲ τὴν τοῦ Νικάνορος κεφαλὴν ἐκ τῆς ἄκρας 35
ἔπιδηλον πᾶσι, καὶ φανερὸν τῆς τοῦ Κυρίου βοηθείας σημεῖον.
Ἐδογμάτισαν δὲ πάντες μετὰ κοινοῦ ψηφίσματος μηδαμῶς ἐᾶ- 36
σαι ἀπαράσημαντον τήνδε τὴν ἡμέραν· ἔχειν δὲ ἐπίσημον τὴν
τρισκαιδεκάτην τοῦ δωδεκάτου μηνός, Ἄδαρ λέγεται τῇ Συρι-
κῇ φωνῇ, πρὸ μιᾶς ἡμέρας τῆς Μαρδοχαϊκῆς ἡμέρας. Τῶν οὖν 37
κατὰ Νικάνορα χωρησάντων οὕτως, καὶ ἀπ᾿ ἐκείνων τῶν καιρῶν
κρατηθείσης τῆς πόλεως ὑπὸ τῶν Ἑβραίων, καὶ αὐτὸς αὐτόθι
τὸν λόγον καταπαύσω. Καὶ εἰ μὲν καλῶς καὶ εὐθίκτως τῇ συν- 38
τάξει, τοῦτο καὶ αὐτὸς ἤθελον· εἰ δὲ εὐτελῶς καὶ μετρίως, τοῦτο
ἐφικτὸν ἦν μοι. Καθάπερ γὰρ οἶνον καταμόνας πίνειν, ὡσαύτως 39
δὲ καὶ ὕδωρ πάλιν πολέμιον· ὃν δὲ τρόπον οἶνος ὕδατι συγκερα-
σθεὶς ἡδύς, καὶ ἐπιτερπῆ τὴν χάριν ἀποτελεῖ, οὕτως καὶ τὸ τῆς
κατασκευῆς τοῦ λόγου τέρπει τὰς ἀκοὰς τῶν ἐντυγχανόντων τῇ
συντάξει· ἐνταῦθα δὲ ἔσται ἡ τελευτή.

**Chapter 15**

...thirty and five thousand, being greatly gladdened by the glorious manifestation of God.

**28** And when they had come from the [toil of the] battle, and were returning with joy, they did discover Nicanor fallen forward with all his armor. **29** And when a cry and a tumult had arisen, they blessed the Sovereign Lord in their ancestral tongue.

**30** And the chief champion for his countrymen, who in body and soul had stood forth wholly for his fellow citizens, and had preserved the kindness of his youth toward his kinsmen, did command that they should cut off the head of Nicanor, and his hand with his shoulder, and carry them about unto Jerusalem. **31** And when he had come thither, and had called together his countrymen, and had set the priests before the altar, he did send for them that were in the citadel.

**32** And having shown forth the head of the vile Nicanor, and the hand of the blasphemer (which he, having stretched forth, had boasted against the holy house of the Almighty), **33** and having cut out the tongue of the impious Nicanor, he said that he would give [the body] in portions to the birds, and would hang the recompense of his folly over against the temple.

**34** And all of them blessed the manifest Lord, [looking] unto heaven, saying, "Blessed be He who hath preserved His own place undefiled." **35** And he did fasten Nicanor's head from the citadel, manifest to all, and a clear sign of the Lord's help.

**36** And all did decree with a common resolution, by no means to suffer this day to pass unremarked; but to hold as notable the thirteenth day of the twelfth month (which is called Adar in the Syrian tongue), one day before the day of Mordecai.

**37** Therefore, since the matters concerning Nicanor did transpire in such wise, and from those times the city hath been held by the Hebrews, I myself shall here bring the discourse to an end. **38** And if I have composed it well and fittingly, this also I myself did desire; but if poorly and but moderately, this was all that was within my reach. **39** For as it is harmful to drink wine alone, and likewise water alone is harmful; but as wine mingled with water is sweet, and produceth a pleasing savor, so also the composition of the discourse doth delight the ears of them that encounter this narrative; and here shall be the end.
