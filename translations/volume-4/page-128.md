τῶν λόγων τούτων, εἶπαν· Τίνα χάριν ἀπεδώσαμεν Σίμωνι καὶ
τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ; Ἐστήρισε γὰρ αὐτὸς καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ 26
καὶ ὁ οἶκος τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπολέμησαν τοὺς ἐχθροὺς Ἰσραὴλ
ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔστησαν αὐτῷ ἐλευθερίαν, καὶ κατέγραψαν
ἐν δέλτοις χαλκαῖς, καὶ ἔθεντο ἐν στήλῃ ἐν ὄρει Σιών. Καὶ τοῦτο 27
τὸ ἀντίγραφον τῆς γραφῆς· Ὀκτωκαιδεκάτη Ἐλούλ, ἔτους δευ-
τέρου καὶ ἑβδομηκοστοῦ καὶ ἑκατοστοῦ, καὶ τοῦτο τρίτον ἔτος
ἐπὶ Σίμωνος τοῦ ἀρχιερέως, ἐν Σαραμελ, ἐπὶ συναγωγῆς μεγάλης 28
τῶν ἱερέων καὶ λαοῦ καὶ ἀρχόντων ἔθνους καὶ τῶν πρεσβυτέρων
τῆς χώρας ἐγνώρισεν ἡμῖν. Ἐπεὶ πολλάκις ἐγενήθησαν πόλεμοι 29
ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ, Σίμων δὲ ὁ υἱὸς Ματταθίου ὁ υἱὸς τῶν υἱῶν
Ἰαρίβ δύο, καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ ἔδωκαν ἑαυτοῖς τῷ κινδύνῳ,
καὶ ἀντέστησαν τοῖς ὑπεναντίοις τοῦ ἔθνους αὐτῶν, ὅπως σωθῇ
τὰ ἅγια αὐτῶν καὶ ὁ νόμος, καὶ δόξῃ μεγάλῃ ἐδόξασαν τὸ ἔθνος
αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἤθροισεν Ἰωναθαν τὸ ἔθνος αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐγενήθη 30
αὐτοῖς ἀρχιερεύς, καὶ προσετέθη πρὸς τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐβου- 31
λήθησαν οἱ ἐχθροὶ αὐτῶν ἐμβατεῦσαι εἰς τὴν χώραν αὐτοῦ τοῦ
ἐκτρίψαι (εἰς) τὴν χώραν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐκτεῖναι τὰς χεῖρας ἐπὶ
τὰ ἅγια αὐτῶν. Τότε ἀνέστη Σίμων, καὶ ἐπολέμησε περὶ τοῦ 32
ἔθνους αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐδαπάνησε χρήματα πολλὰ τῶν ἑαυτοῦ, καὶ
ὡπλοδότησε τοὺς ἄνδρας τῆς δυνάμεως τοῦ ἔθνους αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔ-
δωκεν αὐτοῖς ὀψώνια· Καὶ ὠχύρωσε τὰς πόλεις τῆς Ἰουδαίας 33
καὶ τὴν Βεθσοῦραν τὴν ἐπὶ τῶν ὁρίων τῆς Ἰουδαίας, οὗ ἦν τὰ
ὅπλα τῶν πολεμίων τοπρότερον, καὶ ἔθετο ἐκεῖ φρουρὰν ἄνδρας
Ἰουδαίους· Καὶ Ἰόππην ὠχύρωσε τὴν ἐπὶ τῆς θαλάσσης, καὶ 34
τὴν Γαζάραν τὴν ἐπὶ τῶν ὁρίων Ἀζώτου, ἐν ᾗ ᾤκουν οἱ πολέμιοι
τοπρότερον ἐκεῖ, καὶ κατώκισεν ἐκεῖ Ἰουδαίους, καὶ ὅσα
ἐπιτήδεια ἦν πρὸς τὴν τούτων ἐπανόρθωσιν ἔθετο ἐν αὐτοῖς. Καὶ 35
εἶδεν ὁ λαὸς τὴν πρᾶξιν τοῦ Σίμωνος, καὶ τὴν δόξαν ἣν ἐβου-
λεύσατο ποιῆσαι τῷ ἔθνει αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔθεντο αὐτὸν ἡγούμενον
αὐτῶν καὶ ἀρχιερέα, διὰ τὸ πεποιηκέναι αὐτὸν ταῦτα πάντα,
καὶ τὴν δικαιοσύνην, καὶ τὴν πίστιν ἣν συνετήρησε τῷ ἔθνει αὐ-
τοῦ, καὶ ἐξεζήτησε παντὶ τρόπῳ ὑψῶσαι τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ.
Καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις αὐτοῦ εὐωδώθη ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτοῦ, 36
τοῦ ἐξαρθῆναι τὰ ἔθνη ἐκ τῆς χώρας αὐτῶν, καὶ τοὺς ἐν τῇ
πόλει Δαυὶδ τοὺς ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, οἱ ἐποίησαν ἑαυτοῖς ἄκραν,
ἐξ ἧς ἐξεπορεύοντο, καὶ ἐμίσχνον κύκλῳ τῶν ἁγίων, καὶ ἐποίουν 37
σαν πληγὴν μεγάλην ἐν τῇ ἀγνείᾳ. Καὶ κατῴκισεν ἐν αὐτῇ
ἄνδρας Ἰουδαίους, καὶ ὠχύρωσεν αὐτὴν πρὸς ἀσφάλειαν τῆς χώ-
ρας καὶ τῆς πόλεως, καὶ ὕψωσε τὰ τείχη Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ 38
ὁ βασιλεὺς Δημήτριος ἔστησεν αὐτῷ τὴν ἀρχιερωσύνην κατὰ ταῦ-
τα, καὶ ἐποίησεν αὐτὸν τῶν φίλων αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐδόξασεν αὐτὸν 39
δόξῃ μεγάλῃ· ἔχουσε γὰρ ὅτι προσηγόρευονται Ἰουδαῖοι ὑπὸ Ῥω-
μαίων φίλοι καὶ σύμμαχοι καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοί, καὶ ὅτι ἀπήντησαν τοῖς 40
πρεσβευταῖς Σίμωνος ἐνδόξως· Καὶ ἔτι οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς 41
εὐδόκησαν τοῦ εἶναι αὐτῶν Σίμωνα ἡγούμενον καὶ ἀρχιερέα εἰς
τὸν αἰῶνα, ἕως τοῦ ἀναστῆναι προφήτην πιστόν· Καὶ τοῦ εἶναι 42
ἐπ᾿ αὐτῶν στρατηγόν, καὶ ὅπως μέλοι αὐτῷ περὶ τῶν ἁγίων
καθιστάναι αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ τῶν ἔργων αὐτῶν καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς χώρας
καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν ὅπλων καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν ὀχυρωμάτων· Καὶ ὅπως μέλοι 43
αὐτῷ περὶ τῶν ἁγίων, καὶ ὅπως ἀκούηται ὑπὸ πάντων, καὶ
ὅπως γράφωνται ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι αὐτοῦ πᾶσαι συγγραφαὶ ἐν τῇ
χώρᾳ, καὶ ὅπως περιβάλληται πορφύραν καὶ χρυσοφορῇ· Καὶ 44
οὐκ ἔξεστιν οὐδενὶ τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ τῶν ἱερέων ἀθετῆσαί τι τούτων
καὶ ἀντειπεῖν τοῖς ὑπ᾿ αὐτοῦ ῥηθησομένοις, καὶ ἐπισυστρέψαι συ-
στροφὴν ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ ἄνευ αὐτοῦ, καὶ περιβαλέσθαι πορφύραν καὶ 45
ἐμποροῦσθαι πόρπην χρυσῆν· Ὃς δ᾿ ἂν παρὰ ταῦτα ποιήσῃ ἢ
ἀθετήσῃ τι τούτων, ἔνοχος ἔσται. Καὶ εὐδόκησε πᾶς ὁ λαὸς δέ- 46
ξασθαι Σίμωνι καὶ ποιῆσαι κατὰ τοὺς λόγους τούτους. Καὶ ἐπε- 47
δέξατο Σίμων καὶ εὐδόκησεν ἀρχιερατεῦσαι καὶ εἶναι στρατηγὸς
καὶ ἐθνάρχης τῶν Ἰουδαίων καὶ ἱερέων καὶ τοῦ προστατῆσαι 48
πάντων. Καὶ τὴν γραφὴν ταύτην εἶπαν θέσθαι ἐν δέλτοις χαλ-
καῖς, καὶ στῆσαι αὐτὰς ἐν περιβόλῳ τῶν ἁγίων ἐν τόπῳ ἐπι-
σήμῳ. Τὰ δὲ ἀντίγραφα αὐτῶν θέσθαι ἐν τῷ γαζοφυλακίῳ, ὅπως 49
ἔχῃ Σίμων καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ.

**Chapter 14**
**25** of these words, they said, "What thanks have we rendered unto Simon and unto his sons?
**26** For he himself, and his brethren, and the house of his father, did uphold [us]; and they did make war against the enemies of Israel, removing them from among them; and they established for him freedom, and they did inscribe [these things]
**27** upon bronze tablets, and did set [them] in a pillar on Mount Zion. And this is the copy of the writing: 'On the eighteenth day of Elul, in the one hundred seventy-second year—and this being the third year
**28** under Simon the High Priest—in Saramel, at a great assembly of the priests, and of the people, and of the rulers of the nation, and of the elders of the land, it was made known unto us:
**29** "Forasmuch as oftentimes there have been wars in the land, but Simon, the son of Mattathias, the son of the sons of Jarib, two, and his brethren, did yield themselves unto danger,
**30** and did stand against the adversaries of their nation, that their holy places and the Law might be saved; and with great glory did they glorify their nation. And Jonathan gathered their nation, and he was made High Priest unto them, and was gathered unto his people.
**31** And their enemies did purpose to invade his land, to utterly destroy [even into] their land, and to stretch forth their hands upon their holy places.
**32** Then Simon did rise up, and fought for his nation, and did spend much money of his own, and did arm the men of the strength of his nation, and gave unto them wages.
**33** And he fortified the cities of Judea, and Bethzur, which is upon the borders of Judea, where the weapons of the adversaries formerly had been, and he placed there a garrison of Jewish men.
**34** And Joppa, which is by the sea, did he fortify, and Gazara, which is upon the borders of Azotus, where the adversaries formerly did dwell, and there he settled Jews; and whatsoever things were needful for their restoration, he did place within them.
**35** And the people saw the works of Simon, and the glory which he purposed to do for his nation, and they appointed him their leader and High Priest, because he had wrought all these things, and [because of] the righteousness and the faithfulness which he had maintained for his nation, and did seek by every means to exalt his people.
**36** And in his days did [his work] prosper in his hands, that the nations were removed from their land, and those in the city of David—even those in Jerusalem—who had made for themselves a citadel,
**37** from which they issued forth, and did mingle round about the holy places, and did work as a great wound in the purity. And he settled in it Jewish men, and fortified it for the safety of the land and of the city,
**38** and did raise the walls of Jerusalem. And King Demetrius did confirm unto him the High Priesthood according to these things,
**39** and made him one of his friends, and did glorify him with great glory; for they knew that the Jews are called by the Romans friends and allies and brethren;
**40** and that they had met the ambassadors of Simon with honor.
**41** And furthermore, the Jews and the priests were pleased that Simon should be their leader and High Priest forever, until a faithful prophet should arise.
**42** And that he should be general over them, and that he should have care concerning the holy things, [empowered] to appoint them over their works and over the land and over the weapons and over the fortifications;
**43** And that he should have care concerning the holy things, and that he should be obeyed by all, and that all writings in the land should be set down in his name, and that he should wear purple and bear gold.
**44** And it is not lawful for any of the people or of the priests to set aside any of these things,
**45** or to speak against that which shall be spoken by him, or to gather a faction in the land without him, or to wear purple and to adorn himself with a golden clasp. Whosoever shall do contrary to these things,
**46** or shall set aside any of them, shall be guilty. And all the people were pleased to assent unto Simon, and to do according to these words.
**47** And Simon did accept and was pleased to be High Priest, and to be general and ethnarch of the Jews and priests, and to be the protector of all.
**48** And they commanded that this writing should be placed upon bronze tablets, and that they should be set up in the enclosure of the holy places in a conspicuous place.
**49** And the copies thereof were to be placed in the treasury, that Simon and his sons might have them.' "

**Chapter 15**
**1** And Antiochus, the son of King Demetrius, sent letters from the islands of the sea unto Simon the priest and ethnarch of the Jews, and unto all the nation.
**2** And they were of this tenor: "King Antiochus unto Simon the High Priest and Ethnarch, and..."
