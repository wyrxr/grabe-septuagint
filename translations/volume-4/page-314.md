τῷ σπέρματι αὐτοῦ. Πλὴν ἐν γῇ λαοῦ οὐ κληρονομήσει, καὶ 22
μερὶς οὐκ ἔστιν αὐτῷ ἐν λαῷ· αὐτὸς γὰρ μερὶς αὐτοῦ καὶ κληρονομία.
Καὶ Φινεὲς υἱὸς Ἐλεάζαρ τρίτος εἰς δόξαν, ἐν τῷ ζηλῶσαι 23
αὐτὸν ἐν φόβῳ Κυρίου, καὶ στῆναι αὐτὸν ἐν τροπῇ λαοῦ ἐν
ἀγαθότητι προθυμίας ψυχῆς αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐξιλάσατο περὶ τοῦ Ἰσραήλ.
Διὰ τοῦτο ἐστάθη αὐτῷ διαθήκη εἰρήνης, προστατεῖν ἁγίων 24
καὶ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ, ἵνα αὐτῷ ᾖ καὶ τῷ σπέρματι αὐτοῦ ἱερωσύνην
μεγαλεῖον εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας· κατὰ διαθήκην τῷ Δαυΐδ, υἱῷ Ἰεσσαὶ ἐκ 25
φυλῆς Ἰούδα, κληρονομίας βασιλέως υἱοῦ ἐξ υἱοῦ μόνου, κληρονομία
Ἀαρὼν καὶ τῷ σπέρματι αὐτοῦ. Δῴη ὑμῖν σοφίαν ἐν καρδίᾳ ὑμῶν, 26
κρίνειν τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ ἐν δικαιοσύνῃ, ἵνα μὴ ἀφανισθῇ τὰ ἀγαθὰ
αὐτῶν, καὶ τὴν δόξαν αὐτῶν εἰς γενεὰν αὐτῶν.

ΚΕΦ. ΜϚ΄. XLVI.

ΚΡΑΤΑΙΟΣ ἐν πολέμῳ Ἰησοῦς υἱὸς Ναυῆ, καὶ διάδοχος 1
Μωσῆ ἐν προφητείαις· ὃς ἐγένετο κατὰ τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ μέγας ἐπὶ
σωτηρίᾳ ἐκλεκτῶν αὐτοῦ, ἐκδικῆσαι ἐπεγειρομένους ἐχθρούς, ὅπως
κατακληρονομήσῃ τὸν Ἰσραήλ. Ὡς ἐδοξάσθη ἐν τῷ ἐπᾶραι χεῖρας 2
αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐν τῷ ἐκτεῖναι ῥομφαίαν ἐπὶ πόλεις. Τίς πρότερος 3
αὐτοῦ οὕτως ἔστη; τοῦ; γὰρ πολέμους Κυρίου αὐτὸς ἀπήγαγεν.
Οὐχὶ ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ ἐνεποδίσθη ὁ ἥλιος, καὶ μία ἡμέρα ἐγενήθη 4
πρὸς δύο; Ἐπεκαλέσατο τὸν Ὕψιστον δυνάστην, ἐν τῷ θλίψαι 5
αὐτὸν ἐχθροὺς κυκλόθεν· καὶ ἐπήκουσεν αὐτοῦ μέγας Κύριος ἐν
λίθοις χαλάζης δυνάμεως κραταιᾶς· κατέρρεξεν ἐπ’ ἔθνος πολέμων, 6
καὶ ἐν καταβάσει ἀπώλεσεν ἀνθεστηκότας, ἵνα γνωσθῶσιν ἔθνη
πανοπλίαν αὐτοῦ, ὅτι ἐναντίον Κυρίου ὁ πόλεμος αὐτοῦ· καὶ γὰρ
ἐπηκολούθησεν ὀπίσω δυνάστου. Καὶ ἐν ἡμέραις Μωσέως ἐποίησεν 7
ἔλεος αὐτὸς καὶ Χαλὲβ υἱὸς Ἰεφονῆ, ἀντιστῆναι ἔναντι ἐκκλησίας,
κωλῦσαι λαὸν ἀπὸ ἁμαρτίας, καὶ κοπάσαι γογγυσμὸν πονηρίας·
καὶ αὐτοὶ δύο ὄντες διεσώθησαν ἀπὸ ἑξακοσίων χιλιάδων 8
πεζῶν, εἰσάγειν αὐτοὺς εἰς κληρονομίαν, εἰς γῆν ῥέουσαν γάλα
καὶ μέλι. Καὶ ἔδωκεν ὁ Κύριος τῷ Χαλὲβ ἰσχύν, καὶ ἕως γήρους 9
διέμεινεν αὐτῷ, ἐπιβῆναι αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὸ ὕψος τῆς γῆς, καὶ τὸ σπέρμα
αὐτοῦ κατέσχε τὴν κληρονομίαν· ὅπως ἴδωσι πάντες οἱ υἱοὶ 10
Ἰσραήλ, ὅτι καλὸν τὸ πορεύεσθαι ὀπίσω Κυρίου.

**The Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach**

**Chapter Forty-Five**

21 ...unto his seed.
But in the land of the people shall he not inherit,
Neither is there any portion for him among the people;
For He Himself is his portion and his inheritance.
23 And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the third [in succession], rose unto glory,
In that he was zealous with the fear of the Lord,
And stood he up in the turning away of the people,
In the goodness and fervent zeal of his soul;
And he made propitiation for Israel.
24 Therefore was a covenant of peace established unto him,
To preside over the holy things and over his people,
That unto him and to his seed there might be a priesthood of great majesty,
Enduring unto the ages;
25 According to the covenant made with David, the son of Jesse,
From the tribe of Judah, concerning the inheritance of a king, a son from a son alone,
So also is the inheritance of Aaron and of his seed.
26 May He grant unto you wisdom in your heart,
To judge His people in righteousness,
Lest their good things be blotted out,
And their glory unto their generation.

**Chapter Forty-Six**

1 Mighty in war was Jesus [Joshua], the son of Nave [Nun],
And successor of Moses in prophecies;
Who, according to his name, became great
For the salvation of His chosen ones,
To take vengeance upon [their] rising enemies,
That he might grant Israel their inheritance.
2 How was he glorified in the lifting up of his hands,
And in the stretching forth of his sword against cities!
3 Who before him ever stood thus?
Of whom [do you speak]? For he himself led the wars of the Lord.
4 Was not the sun hindered by his hand?
And one day became as two?
5 He called upon the Most High Sovereign,
When his enemies oppressed him round about;
And the great Lord heard him with stones of hail,
Of mighty power;
6 He poured down upon a nation of wars,
And in his descent, He destroyed those who resisted;
That the nations might know His full might,
That his war was [waged] before the Lord;
For indeed, he followed after the Mighty One.
7 And in the days of Moses, he and Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, did a deed of mercy,
To stand against the assembly,
To restrain the people from sin,
And to make the murmur of wickedness to cease.
8 And they, being but two, were saved from six hundred thousand footmen,
To bring [the people] into the inheritance,
Into a land flowing with milk and honey.
9 And the Lord gave strength unto Caleb,
And it remained with him even unto old age,
That he might ascend upon the high place of the land;
And his seed possessed the inheritance.
10 That all the sons of Israel might behold
That it is good to walk after the Lord.
