**ΚΕΦ. Θʹ. ΜΑΚΚΑΒΑΙΩΝ Αʹ. 1639**
45 ἐξόπισθεν ἡμῶν· τὸ δὲ ὕδωρ τοῦ Ἰορδάνου ἔνθεν καὶ ἔνθεν καὶ
46 ἕλος καὶ δρυμός, καὶ οὐκ ἔστι τόπος τοῦ ἐκκλῖναι. Νῦν οὖν, κεκρατήσατε εἰς αὔξησιν, ὅπως διατρώγητε ἐκ χειρὸς ἐχθρῶν ὑμῶν.
47 Καὶ συνῆψεν ὁ πόλεμος· καὶ ἐξέτεινεν Ἰωνάθαν τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ πατάξαι τὸν Βακχίδην, καὶ ἐξέκλινεν ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω.
48 Καὶ ἐνεπήδησεν Ἰωνάθαν καὶ οἱ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸν Ἰορδάνην, καὶ διεκολύμβησαν εἰς τὸ πέραν, καὶ οὐ διέβησαν ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς τὸν Ἰορδάνην.
49 Καὶ διέπεσον παρὰ Βακχίδου τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ εἰς χιλίους ἄνδρας.
50 Καὶ ἀπέστρεψεν εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ, καὶ ᾠκοδόμησαν πόλεις ὀχυρὰς ἐν τῇ Ἰουδαίᾳ, τὸ ὀχύρωμα τὸ ἐν Ἱεριχὼ, καὶ τὴν Ἐμμαοὺμ, καὶ τὴν Βαιθωρὼν, καὶ τὴν Βαιθὴλ, καὶ τὴν Θαμναθὰ Φαραθωνὶ, καὶ τὴν Τερὼν ἐν τείχεσιν ὑψηλοῖς καὶ πύλαις καὶ μοχλοῖς.
51 Καὶ ἔθεντο φρουρὰν ἐν αὐτοῖς τοῦ ἐχθραίνειν τῷ Ἰσραήλ.
52 Καὶ ὠχύρωσαν τὴν πόλιν τὴν ἐν Βαιθσούρα, καὶ Γαζάραν, καὶ τὴν ἄκραν, καὶ ἔθεντο ἐν αὐταῖς δυνάμεις καὶ παραθέσεις βρωμάτων.
53 Καὶ ἔλαβον τοὺς υἱοὺς τῶν ἡγουμένων τῆς χώρας ὅμηρα, καὶ ἔθεντο αὐτοὺς ἐν τῇ ἄκρα ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐν φυλακῇ.
54 Καὶ ἐν ἔτει τριτῷ καὶ πεντηκοστῷ καὶ ἑκατοστῷ τῷ μηνὶ τῷ δευτέρῳ ἐπέταξεν Ἄλκιμος καθαιρεῖν τὸ τεῖχος τῆς αὐλῆς τῶν ἁγίων τῆς ἐσωτέρας, καὶ καθεῖλε τὰ ἔργα τῶν προφητῶν, καὶ ἐνήρξατο τοῦ καθαιρεῖν.
55 Ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ ἐπλήγη Ἄλκιμος, καὶ ἐνεποδίσθη τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀπεφράγη τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ, καὶ παρελύθη, καὶ οὐκ ἐδύνατο ἔτι λαλῆσαι λόγον καὶ ἐντείλασθαι περὶ τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ.
56 Καὶ ἀπέθανεν Ἄλκιμος ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ μετὰ βασάνου μεγάλης.
57 Καὶ ἴδε Βακχίδης ὅτι ἀπέθανεν Ἄλκιμος, καὶ ἀπέστρεψε πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα, καὶ ἡσύχασεν ἡ γῆ Ἰούδα ἔτη δύο.
58 Καὶ ἐβουλεύσαντο οἱ ἄνομοι πάντες, λέγοντες· ἰδοὺ Ἰωνάθαν καὶ οἱ παρ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἐν ἡσυχίᾳ κατοικοῦσι πεποιθότες, νῦν οὖν ἀζόμεν τὸν Βακχίδην, καὶ συλλάβεται αὐτοὺς πάντας ἐν νυκτὶ μιᾷ.
59 Καὶ πορευθέντες συνεβουλεύσαντο αὐτῷ.
60 Καὶ ἀπῆρε τοῦ ἐλθεῖν μετὰ δυνάμεως πολλῆς, καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ἐπιστολὰς λάθρᾳ πᾶσι τοῖς συμμάχοις αὑτοῦ τοῖς ἐν τῇ Ἰουδαίᾳ, ὅπως συλλάβωσι τὸν Ἰωνάθαν καὶ τοὺς σὺν αὐτῷ, καὶ οὐκ ἠδύναντο, ὅτι ἐγνώσθη αὐτοῖς ἡ βουλὴ αὑτῶν.
61 Καὶ συνέλαβον ἀπὸ τῶν ἀνδρῶν τῆς χώρας τῶν ἀρχηγῶν τῆς κακίας εἰς πεντήκοντα ἄνδρας, καὶ ἀπέκτεινεν αὐτούς.
62 Καὶ ἐξεχώρησεν Ἰωνάθαν καὶ Σίμων καὶ οἱ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ εἰς Βαιθβασὶ τὴν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, καὶ ᾠκοδόμησε τὰ καθηρημένα αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐτερέωσεν αὐτήν.
63 Καὶ ἔγνω Βακχίδης καὶ συνήγαγε πᾶν τὸ πλῆθος αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοῖς ἐκ τῆς Ἰουδαίας παρήγγειλε.
64 Καὶ ἐλθὼν παρενέβαλεν ἐπὶ Βαιθβασί, καὶ ἐπολέμησεν αὐτὴν ἡμέρας πολλάς,
65 καὶ ἐποίησε μηχανάς.
66 Καὶ ἀπέλιπεν Ἰωνάθαν Σίμωνα τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ πόλει, καὶ ἐξῆλθεν εἰς τὴν χώραν, καὶ ἦλθεν ἐν ἀριθμῷ.
67 Καὶ ἐπάταξεν Ὀδοαρρῆν καὶ τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς Φασιρὼν ἐν τῷ σκηνώματι αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐξῆρξατο τύπτειν καὶ ἀναβαίνειν ἐν ταῖς δυνάμεσι.
68 Καὶ Σίμων καὶ οἱ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἐξῆλθον ἐκ τῆς πόλεως, καὶ ἐνεπύρισαν τὰς μηχανάς.
69 Καὶ ἐπολέμησαν πρὸς τὸν Βακχίδην, καὶ συνετρίβη ὑπ᾿ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔθλιβον αὐτὸν σφόδρα,
70 ὅτι ἦν ἡ βουλὴ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἡ ἔφοδος αὐτοῦ κενή.
71 Καὶ ὠργίσθησαν θυμῷ τοῖς ἀνδράσι τοῖς ἀνόμοις τοῖς συμβουλεύσασιν αὐτῷ ἐλθεῖν εἰς τὴν χώραν, καὶ ἀπέκτειναν ἐξ αὐτῶν πολλοὺς,
72 καὶ ἐβουλεύσατο τοῦ ἀπελθεῖν εἰς τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ.
73 Καὶ ἐπέγνω Ἰωνάθαν, καὶ ἀπέστειλε πρὸς αὐτὸν πρέσβεις, τοῦ συνθέσθαι πρὸς αὐτὸν εἰρήνην, καὶ ἀποδοῦναι αὐτοῖς τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν.
74 Καὶ ἀπεδέξατο, καὶ ἐποίησε κατὰ τοὺς λόγους αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὤμοσεν αὐτῷ μὴ ἐκζητῆσαι αὐτῷ κακὸν πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς ζωῆς αὐτοῦ.
75 Καὶ ἀπέδωκεν αὐτῷ τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν ἣν ᾐχμαλώτευσε τοπρότερον ἐκ γῆς Ἰούδα·
76 καὶ ἀποσρέψας ἀπῆλθεν εἰς τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐ προσέθετο ἔτι ἐλθεῖν εἰς τὰ ὅρια αὐτῶν.
77 Καὶ κατέπαυσε ῥομφαία ἐξ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ᾤκησεν Ἰωνάθαν ἐν Μαχμάς·
78 καὶ ἤρξατο Ἰωνάθαν κρίνειν τὸν λαὸν, καὶ ἠφάνισε τοὺς ἀσεβεῖς ἐξ Ἰσραήλ.

**9:45** ...behind us; and the water of the Jordan is on this side and on that, and [there is] a fen and a thicket, and there is no place to turn aside.
**46** Now therefore, be ye strong unto increase, that ye may escape from the hand of your enemies.”
**47** And the battle joined; and Jonathan stretched forth his hand to smite Bacchides, but he turned back from him.
**48** And Jonathan and those with him leaped into the Jordan, and swam across to the farther side, and [Bacchides’ men] crossed not the Jordan after them.
**49** And there fell of Bacchides’ men on that day about a thousand.
**50** And [Bacchides] returned unto Jerusalem, and they built strong cities in Judea: the fortress that is in Jericho, and Emmaus, and Beth-horon, and Bethel, and Thamnata Pharathoni, and Teron, with high walls and gates and bars.
**51** And they placed a garrison in them to be enemies unto Israel.
**52** And they fortified the city of Beth-zur, and Gazara, and the Citadel, and they put forces therein, and provisions of food.
**53** And they took the sons of the leaders of the country as hostages, and placed them in the Citadel in Jerusalem in custody.
**54** And in the one hundred and fifty-third year, in the second month, Alcimus commanded to pull down the wall of the inner court of the Holy [Place], and he pulled down the works of the prophets, and began to pull down.
**55** In that season Alcimus was smitten, and his works were hindered; and his mouth was stopped, and he was paralyzed, and could no longer speak a word, nor give orders concerning his house.
**56** And Alcimus died in that season, after great torment.
**57** And Bacchides perceived that Alcimus was dead, and he returned unto the king, and the land of Judah had rest for two years.
**58** And all the lawless ones took counsel together, saying, “Behold, Jonathan and those with him dwell in quietness, trusting [securely]. Now therefore, let us reverence Bacchides, and he will seize them all in one night.”
**59** And they went and conferred with him.
**60** And he set forth to come with a great force, and sent secret letters to all his allies in Judea, that they should seize Jonathan and those with him. But they could not, for their counsel was made known to [Jonathan and his men].
**61** And [Jonathan’s men] seized from among the men of the land, the leaders of wickedness, about fifty men, and [Jonathan] slew them.
**62** And Jonathan and Simon and those with him withdrew unto Bethbasi, which is in the wilderness, and he rebuilt its ruined parts, and he kept it [secure].
**63** And Bacchides knew [of it], and gathered all his multitude, and gave orders to those of Judea.
**64** And he came and encamped against Bethbasi, and he warred against it for many days,
**65** and he made engines [of war].
**66** And Jonathan left Simon his brother in the city, and he went forth into the country, and came with a company [of men].
**67** And he smote Odoarres and his brethren and the sons of Phasiron in their encampment, and he began to smite and to advance with his forces.
**68** And Simon and those with him came forth from the city, and burned the engines.
**69** And they fought against Bacchides, and he was broken by them, and they pressed him hard,
**70** for his counsel and his assault were in vain.
**71** And [Bacchides and his men] were greatly enraged against the lawless men who had advised him to come into the country, and they slew many of them,
**72** and [Bacchides] resolved to depart to his own land.
**73** And Jonathan perceived [this], and sent ambassadors unto him, to make peace with him, and to restore unto them the captives.
**74** And [Bacchides] assented, and made according to his words, and swore unto him that he would not seek any harm against him all the days of his life.
**75** And he restored unto him the captives which he had taken aforetime from the land of Judah;
**76** and having turned back, he departed to his own land, and he added not again to come into their borders.
**77** And the sword ceased from Israel, and Jonathan dwelt in Michmash;
**78** and Jonathan began to judge the people, and rooted out the ungodly from Israel.
