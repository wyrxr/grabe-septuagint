**KΕΦ. ΛΔʹ. XXXIV.**

1 Ἀγρυπνία πλούτου ἐκτήκει σάρκας, καὶ ἡ μέριμνα αὐτοῦ ἀφιστᾷ ὕπνον·
2 μέριμνα ἀγρυπνίας ἀπωθήσει νυσταγμὸν, καὶ ἀφρρώστημα βαρὺ ἐκνήψει ὕπνον.
3 Ἐκοπίασε πλούσιος ἐν συναγωγῇ χρημάτων, καὶ ἐν τῇ ἀναπαύσει ἐμπίπλαται τῶν τρυφημάτων αὐτοῦ·
4 ἐκοπίασε πτωχὸς ἐν ἐλαττώσει βίου, καὶ ἐν τῇ ἀναπαύσει ἐπιδεὴς γίνεται.
5 Ὁ ἀγαπῶν χρυσίον οὐ δικαιωθήσεται, καὶ ὁ διώκων διαφθοράν, αὐτῆς πλησθήσεται·
6 πολλοὶ ἐδόθησαν εἰς πτῶμα χάριν χρυσίου, καὶ ἐγενήθη ἀπώλεια αὐτῶν κατὰ πρόσωπον αὐτῶν.
7 Ξύλον προσκόμματος ἔστι τοῖς ἐνθουσιάζουσιν αὐτῷ, καὶ πᾶς ἄφρων ἁλώσεται ἐν αὐτῷ.
8 Μακάριος πλούσιος ὃς εὑρέθη ἄμωμος, καὶ ὃς ὀπίσω χρυσίου οὐκ ἐπορεύθη·
9 τίς ἐστι καὶ μακαριοῦμεν αὐτόν; ἐποίησε γὰρ θαυμάσια ἐν λαῷ αὐτοῦ· τίς ἐδοκιμάσθη
10 ἐν αὐτῷ, καὶ ἐτελειώθη; καὶ ἔστω εἰς καύχησιν· τίς ἐδύνατο παραβῆναι, καὶ οὐ παρέβη, καὶ ποιῆσαι κακὰ, καὶ οὐκ ἐποίησε;
11 Στερεωθήσεται τὰ ἀγαθὰ αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰς ἐλεημοσύνας αὐτοῦ ἐκδιηγήσεται ἐκκλησία.
12 Ἐπὶ τραπέζης μεγάλης ἐκάθισας, μὴ ἀνοίξῃς ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς φάρυγγά σου, καὶ μὴ εἴπῃς· πολλὰ γε τὰ ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς.
13 Μνήσθητι ὅτι κακὸν ὀφθαλμὸς πονηρός· πονηρότερον ὀφθαλμοῦ τί ἔκτισται; διὰ τοῦτο ἀπὸ παντὸς προσώπου δακρύει.
14 Οὓ ἐὰν ἐπιβλέψῃ, μὴ ἐκτείνῃς χεῖρά σου, καὶ μὴ συνθλίβου αὐτῷ ἐν τρυβλίῳ.
15 Νόει τὰ τοῦ πλησίον ἐκ σεαυτοῦ, καὶ ἐπὶ παντὶ πράγματι διανοοῦ.
16 Φάγε ὡς ἄνθρωπος τὰ παρακείμενά σοι, καὶ μὴ διαμασῶ, μὴ μισθῇς·
17 παῦσαι πρῶτος χάριν παιδείας, καὶ μὴ ἀπληστεύου μήποτε προσκόψῃς·
18 καὶ εἰ ἀνάμεσον πλειόνων ἐκάθισας, πρότερος αὐτῶν μὴ ἐκτείνῃς τὴν χεῖρά σου.
19 Ὡς ἱκανὸν ἀνθρώπῳ πεπαιδευμένῳ τὸ ὀλίγον, καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς κοίτης αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἀσθμαίνει.
20 Ὕπνος ὑγιείας ἐπὶ ἐντέρῳ μετρίῳ· ἀνέστη πρωΐ, καὶ ἡ ψυχὴ αὐτοῦ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ· πόνος ἀγρυπνίας καὶ χολέρα καὶ στρό-

**Chapter Thirty-Three**

25 A heart that is bright and good,
    concerning the feast of its meats, shall be diligent.

**Chapter Thirty-Four**

1 The sleeplessness of wealth consumeth the flesh,
    and the care thereof banisheth sleep.
2 The anxiety of wakefulness shall repel slumber,
    and a grievous infirmity shall dispel sleep.
3 The rich man hath toiled in the gathering of money,
    and in his rest he is filled with his delicacies;
4 The poor man hath toiled in the scarcity of life,
    and in his rest he becometh needy.
5 He that loveth gold shall not be justified,
    and he that pursueth corruption, with it shall he be filled.
6 Many have been delivered unto ruin for the sake of gold,
    and their destruction came to pass before their very face.
7 A stumbling block it is unto them that are zealous for it,
    and every fool shall be ensnared thereby.
8 Blessed is the rich man who hath been found blameless,
    and who went not after gold.
9 Who is he, that we may call him blessed?
    For he hath done marvelous deeds among his people.
10 Who hath been tried by it, and found perfect?
    And let him be for a boast!
    Who was able to transgress, and did not transgress;
    and to do evils, and did them not?
11 His good deeds shall be established,
    and his alms shall the congregation recount.
12 If thou hast sat at a great table,
    open not thy throat upon it,
    and say not, "Verily, many are the things upon it."
13 Remember that an evil eye is a wicked thing;
    and what is created more wicked than an eye?
    Therefore doth it weep from every countenance.
14 Whomever thou observest, stretch not forth thy hand,
    and crowd him not in the dish.
15 Understand the things of thy neighbor as from thyself,
    and in every matter be thoughtful.
16 Eat as a man the things set before thee,
    and chew not loudly, neither be odious.
17 Cease first for the sake of discipline,
    and be not insatiable, lest thou stumble.
18 And if thou hast sat among many,
    before them stretch not forth thy hand.
19 As little is sufficient for a man well-disciplined,
    and upon his bed he breatheth not heavily.
20 The sleep of health cometh upon a moderate stomach;
    he riseth early, and his soul is with him.
    The pain of sleeplessness, and choler, and griping...
