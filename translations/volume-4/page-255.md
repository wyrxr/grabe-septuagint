ΚΕΦ. ΙΗʹ.
24 ὀργὴν, καὶ διέσχισε τὴν πρὸς τοὺς ζῶντας ὁδόν. Ἐπὶ γὰρ ποδήρους ἐνδύματος ἦν ἔλος ὁ κόσμος, καὶ πατέρων δέξαι ἐπὶ πεπραστίχου λίθου γλυφῆς, καὶ μεγαλωσύνη σου ἐπὶ διαδήματος 25 κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ· τούτοις εἶξεν ὁ ὀλεθρεύων, ταῦτα δὲ ἐφοβήθη· ἦν γὰρ μόνη ἡ πεῖρα τῆς ὀργῆς ἱκανή.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΘ΄. ΧΙΧ.

1 Τοῖς δὲ ἀσεβέσι μέχρι τέλους ἀνελεήμων θυμὸς ἐπέστη· προή2 δει γὰρ αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ μέλλοντα. Ὅτι αὐτοὶ ἐπιτρέψαντες τοῦ ἀπεῖναι, καὶ μετὰ σπουδῆς προπέμψαντες αὐτοὺς, διώξουσι μετα3 μεληθέντες· ἔτι γὰρ ἐν χερσὶν ἔχοντες τὰ πένθη, καὶ προσοδυρόμενοι τάφοις νεκρῶν, ἕτερον ἐπεσπάσαντο λογισμὸν ἀνοίας, καὶ 4 οὓς ἱκετεύοντες ἐξέβαλον, τούτους ὡς φυγάδας ἐδίωκον. Εἵλκε γὰρ αὐτοὺς ἡ ἀξία ἐπὶ τοῦτο τὸ πέρας ἀνάγκη, καὶ τῶν συμβε5 βηκότων ἀμνησίαν ἐνέβαλεν, ἵνα τὴν λείπουσαν ταῖς βασάνοις προσαναπληρώσωσι κόλασιν· καὶ ὁ μὲν λαός σου παράδοξον ὁδοιπο6 ρίαν περάσῃ, ἐκεῖνοι δὲ ξένον εὕρωσι θάνατον. Ὅλη γὰρ ἡ κτίσις ἐν ἰδίῳ γένει πάλιν ἄνωθεν διετυποῦτο, ὑπηρετοῦσα ταῖς σαῖς ἐπι7 ταγαῖς, ἵνα οἱ σοὶ παῖδες φυλαχθῶσιν ἀβλαβεῖς τῇ τὴν παρεμβολὴν σκιαζούσῃ νεφέλῃ· ἐκ δὲ προύφρεστος ὕδατος ξηρᾶς ἀνάδυσις γῆς ἐθεωρεῖτο, ἐξ ἐρυθρᾶς θαλάσσης ἐδὸς ἀνεμπόδιστος, καὶ 8 χλοηφόρον πεδίον ἐκ κλύδωνος βιαίου· δι᾽ οὗ πᾶν ἔθνος διῆλθον οἱ 9 τῇ σῇ σκεπαζόμενοι χειρὶ, θεωρήσαντες θαυμαστὰ τέρατα. Ὡς γὰρ ἵπποι ἐνεμήθησαν, καὶ ὡς ἀμνοὶ διεσκίρτησαν, αἰνοῦντές σε 10 Κύριε τὸν εὐσάμενον αὐτούς· ἐμέμνηντο γὰρ ἔτι τῶν ἐν τῇ παροικίᾳ αὐτῶν, πῶς ἀντὶ μὲν γενέσεως ζώων ἐξήγαγεν ἡ γῆ σκνῖφας ἀντὶ δὲ ἐνύδρων ἐξηρεύξατο ὁ ποταμὸς πλῆθος βατράχων. 11 ἐφ᾽ ὑστέρῳ δὲ ἴδον καὶ γένεσιν νέαν ὀρνέων, ὅτε ἐπιθυμίᾳ προχχθέντες ἠτήσαντο ἐδέσματα τρυφῆς, εἰς γὰρ παραμυθίαν ἀνέβη 12 αὐτοῖς ἀπὸ θαλάσσης ὀρτυγομήτρα. Καὶ αἱ τιμωρίαι τοῖς ἁμαρτωλοῖς ἐπῆλθον, οὐκ ἄνευ τῶν προγεγονότων τεκμηρίων τῇ βίᾳ τῶν κερκυνῶν· δικαίως γὰρ ἔπασχον ταῖς ἰδίαις αὐτῶν πονη13 ρίαις. Καὶ γὰρ χαλεπωτέραν μισοξενίαν ἐπετήδευσαν· οἱ μὲν τοὺς ἀγνῶτας οὐκ ἐδέχοντο παρόντας, οὗτοι δὲ εὐεργέτας ἐξένους ἐδουλοῦντο. 14 Καὶ οὐ μόνον, ἀλλ᾽ ἄλλη τις ἐπισκοπὴ ἔσται

**CHAPTER XVIII.**

**24** wrath, and did cut off the way unto the living. For upon the robe reaching unto the feet, was the world [as] a marsh; and the fathers' acceptance [was] upon a sold-rowed stone engraving, and Thy majesty upon the diadem of his head.
**25** To these did the Destroyer yield, and these did he fear; for the trial of the wrath alone was sufficient.

**CHAPTER XIX.**

**1** But unto the ungodly did relentless wrath come upon [them] even unto the end;
**2** for He did know beforehand also their future things. For they themselves, having permitted [Thy people] to depart, and with diligence having sent them forth, would pursue [them], having repented;
**3** for still having the mournings in their hands, and lamenting over the tombs of the dead, they drew upon themselves another thought of folly,
**4** and those whom they had cast out by supplication, these did they pursue as fugitives. For the just necessity did draw them unto this end, and it did cast upon [them] a forgetfulness of the things that had come to pass,
**5** that they might fill up the remaining punishment unto the torments; and on the one hand, Thy people should accomplish a wondrous journey,
**6** while on the other hand, those [Egyptians] should find a strange death. For the whole creation in its proper kind was again formed anew from above, ministering to Thy commands,
**7** that Thy children might be kept unharmed by the cloud overshadowing the camp; and out of fresh water did a rising of dry land appear, from the Red Sea an unhindered path, and
**8** a grassy plain out of a violent surge; through which all the nation did pass, they that were sheltered by Thy hand, having seen wondrous signs.
**9** For as horses did they graze, and as lambs did they leap about, praising Thee, O Lord, who didst bring them safely forth;
**10** for they did still remember the things in their sojourning, how, instead of the generation of animals, the earth brought forth gnats, and instead of water-creatures, the river did belch forth a multitude of frogs.
**11** But afterward they also saw a new generation of birds, when, being impelled by desire, they asked for luxurious foods;
**12** for as a comfort there came up unto them from the sea a mother of quails. And the punishments came upon the sinners, not without the signs that had gone before, by the violence of the locusts; for justly did they suffer by their own wickednesses.
**13** For they practised a more grievous hatred of strangers; for some did not receive strangers present, but these did enslave as aliens those who were their benefactors.
**14** And not only so, but another visitation shall be
