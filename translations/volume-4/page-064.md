ΚΕΦ. Ε΄. Ο ΙΕΡΕΥΣ
προσῆκον ἦν. Καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα προσφορὰς ἐνδελεχισμοῦ, καὶ θυσίας 51
σαββάτων καὶ νουμηνιῶν καὶ ἑορτῶν πασῶν ἡγιασμένων. Καὶ 52
ἔτι ηὔξαντο εὐχὴν τῷ Θεῷ, ἀπὸ τῆς νουμηνίας τοῦ ἑβδόμου μηνὸς
ἤρξαντο προσφέρειν θυσίας τῷ Θεῷ, καὶ ὁ ναὸς τοῦ Θεοῦ οὔπω
ᾠκοδόμητο. Καὶ ἔδωκαν ἀργύριον τοῖς λατόμοις καὶ τέκτοσι, καὶ 53
βρωτά, καὶ ποτά, καὶ κέδρα τοῖς Σιδωνίοις καὶ Τυρίοις εἰς τὸ
παράγειν αὐτοὺς ἐκ τοῦ Λιβάνου ξύλα κέδρινα, διαφέρειν σχεδίας
εἰς τὸν Ἰόππης λιμένα, κατὰ τὸ πρόσταγμα τὸ γραφὲν αὐτοῖς
παρὰ Κύρου τοῦ Περσῶν βασιλέως. Καὶ τῷ δευτέρῳ ἔτει παρα- 54
γενόμενος εἰς τὸ ἱερὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ μηνὸς δευτέρου,
ἤρξατο Ζοροβάβελ ὁ τοῦ Σαλαθιὴλ, καὶ Ἰησοῦς ὁ τοῦ Ἰωσεδὲκ,
καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτῶν, καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς, οἱ Λευῖται, καὶ πάντες οἱ πα-
ραγενόμενοι ἐκ τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ, καὶ ἐθεμελίω- 55
σαν τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Θεοῦ τῇ νουμηνίᾳ τοῦ δευτέρου μηνὸς, τοῦ δευ-
τέρου ἔτους, ἐν τῷ ἐλθεῖν εἰς τὴν Ἰουδαίαν καὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ 56
ἔστησαν τοὺς Λευίτας ἀπὸ εἰκοσαετοῦς ἐπὶ τῶν ἔργων τοῦ Κυ-
ρίου. καὶ ἔστη Ἰησοῦς, καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ, καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοί, καὶ Καδ-
μιὴλ ὁ ἀδελφὸς, καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰησοῦ Ἡμαδαβοῦν, καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰωδὰ
τοῦ Ἡλιαδοὺδ σὺν τοῖς υἱοῖς καὶ ἀδελφοῖς, πάντες οἱ Λευῖται ὁ-
μοίμαδον ἐργοδιῶκται, ποιοῦντες εἰς τὰ ἔργα ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ
Θεοῦ. Καὶ ᾠκοδόμησαν οἱ οἰκοδόμοι τὸν ναὸν τοῦ Κυρίου. Καὶ 57
ἔστησαν οἱ ἱερεῖς ἐστολισμένοι μετὰ μουσικῶν καὶ σαλπίγγων, καὶ
οἱ Λευῖται οἱ υἱοὶ Ἀσὰφ ἔχοντες τὰ κύμβαλα, ὑμνοῦντες τῷ Κυ-
ρίῳ, καὶ εὐλογοῦντες κατὰ Δαυὶδ βασιλέα τοῦ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἐφώ- 58
νησαν δι᾽ ὕμνων ὁμολογοῦντες τῷ Κυρίῳ, ὅτι ἡ χρηστότης αὐ-
τοῦ καὶ ἡ δόξα εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας ἐν παντὶ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς 59
ἐσάλπισαν καὶ ἐβόησαν φωνῇ μεγάλῃ, ὑμνοῦντες τῷ Κυρίῳ
ἐπὶ τῇ ἐγέρσει τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ Κυρίου. Καὶ ἦλθοσαν ἐκ τῶν ἱερέων 60
τῶν Λευιτῶν καὶ τῶν προκαθημένων κατὰ τὰς πατριὰς αὐ-
τῶν, οἱ πρεσβύτεροι οἱ προεωρακότες τὸν πρὸ τούτου οἶκον πρὸς
τὴν τούτου οἰκοδομὴν μετὰ κραυγῆς καὶ κλαυθμοῦ μεγάλου. Καὶ 61
πολλοὶ διὰ σαλπίγγων καὶ χαρᾶς μεγάλῃ φωνῇ· ὥστε τὸν λαὸν μὴ 62
ἀκούειν τῶν σαλπίγγων διὰ τὸν κλαυθμὸν τοῦ λαοῦ. Ὁ γὰρ ὄχλος
ἦν ὁ σαλπίζων μεγάλως, ὥστε μακρόθεν ἀκούεσθαι. Καὶ ἀκού- 63
σαντες οἱ ἐχθροὶ τῆς φυλῆς Ἰούδα καὶ Βενιαμὶν, ἦλθοσαν ἐπιγνῶναι
τίς ἡ φωνὴ τῶν σαλπίγγων. Καὶ ἐπέγνωσαν ὅτι οἱ ἐκ τῆς 64

**Chapter V. The Priest.**

**50** ...as was fitting. And after these things, [they offered] the continual offerings, and the sacrifices
**51** of the Sabbaths, and of the New Moons, and of all the hallowed feasts.
**52** Yet had they made a solemn vow unto God, and from the new moon of the seventh month they began to offer sacrifices unto God, though the temple of God was not yet built.
**53** And they gave money unto the masons and the carpenters, and food, and drink, and cedar [wood] unto the Sidonians and Tyrians, that they might bring forth cedar timbers from Lebanon, to transport them by raft unto the harbor of Joppa, according to the commandment that was written unto them from Cyrus, the king of the Persians.
**54** And in the second year, when they were come unto the temple of God in Jerusalem, in the second month, Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jesus the son of Josedek, and their brethren, and the priests, the Levites, and all them that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem, began [the work].
**55** And they laid the foundation of the house of God on the new moon of the second month, of the second year, when they were come unto Judea and Jerusalem.
**56** And they set the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, over the work of the Lord. And Jeshua stood forth, and his sons, and his brethren, and Kadmiel his brother, and the sons of Jeshua Himadaboun, and the sons of Joda the Heliadoud, with their sons and brethren; all the Levites, with one accord, [serving as] overseers, performing the work in the house of God.
**57** And the builders built the temple of the Lord. And the priests stood forth, arrayed with musical instruments and with trumpets, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, holding their cymbals, singing praises unto the Lord, and blessing Him after the manner of David, the king of Israel.
**58** And they cried out with hymns, giving thanks unto the Lord, saying that His mercy and His glory endureth unto the ages throughout all Israel.
**59** And all the people blew with trumpets and cried out with a great voice, singing praises unto the Lord upon the raising of the house of the Lord.
**60** And there came forth from among the priests, the Levites, and those who presided over their families, the elders who had seen the former house, [and they wept] at the building of this [new] house, with a great shout and much wailing.
**61** Yet many [shouted] through trumpets and with a loud voice of great joy;
**62** insomuch that the people could not hear the sound of the trumpets because of the weeping of the people. For the multitude was sounding the trumpets with great might, so that it was heard from afar.
**63** And when the enemies of the tribe of Judah and Benjamin heard [it], they came to discern what was the sound of the trumpets.
**64** And they knew that those from the captivity...
