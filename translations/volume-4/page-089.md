1620 ΜΑΚΚΑΒΑΙΩΝ Αʹ. ΚΕΦ. Δʹ.
13 Ἤραν οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτῶν, καὶ ἴδαν αὐτοὺς ἐρχομένους ἐξεναντίας.
14 Καὶ ἐξῆλθαν ἐκ τῆς παρεμβολῆς εἰς πόλεμον, καὶ ἐσάλπισαν οἱ παρὰ Ἰούδα.
15 Καὶ συνῆψαν, καὶ συνετρίβησαν τὰ ἔθνη, καὶ ἔφυγον εἰς τὸ πεδίον. Οἱ δὲ ἔσχατοι πάντες ἔπεσαν ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ, καὶ ἐδίωξαν αὐτοὺς ἕως Γασρὼν καὶ ἕως τῶν πεδίων τῆς Ἰδουμαίας καὶ Ἀζώτου καὶ Ἰαννείας, καὶ ἔπεσαν
16 ἐξ αὐτῶν εἰς ἄνδρας τρισχιλίους.
17 Καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν Ἰούδας καὶ ἡ δύναμις ἀπὸ τοῦ διώκειν ὄπισθεν αὐτῶν, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς τὸν
18 λαόν· μὴ ἐπιθυμήσητε τῶν σκύλων, ὅτι πόλεμος ἐξεναντίας ἡμῶν· καὶ Γοργίας καὶ ἡ δύναμις ἐν τῷ ὄρει ἐγγὺς ἡμῶν· ἀλλὰ
19 στῆτε νῦν ἐναντίον τῶν ἐχθρῶν ἡμῶν, καὶ πολεμήσατε αὐτούς, καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα λάβετε σκῦλα καὶ μετὰ παῤῥησίας.
20 Ἔτι πληροῦντος Ἰούδα ταῦτα, ὤφθη μέρος τι ἐκκύπτον ἐκ τοῦ ὄρους.
21 Καὶ ἴδεν ὅτι τετρόπωται, καὶ ἐμπυρίζουσι τὴν παρεμβολήν, ὃ γὰρ καπνὸς ὁ θεωρούμενος ἐνεφάνιζε τὸ γεγονός.
22 Οἱ δὲ ταῦτα συνιδόντες ἐδειλιώθησαν σφόδρα· συνιδόντες δὲ καὶ Ἰούδα παρεμβολὴν ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ ἑτοίμην εἰς παράταξιν, ἔφυγον πάντες εἰς
23 γῆν ἀλλοφύλων.
24 Καὶ Ἰούδας ἀνέστρεψεν ἐπὶ τὴν σκυλείαν τῆς παρεμβολῆς· καὶ ἔλαβε χρυσίον καὶ ἀργύριον πολὺ καὶ ὑάκινθον καὶ πορφύραν καὶ θαλασσίαν καὶ πλοῦτον μέγαν. Καὶ ἐπιστρέψαντες ὕμνουν καὶ ηὐλόγουν εἰς οὐρανὸν τὸν Κύριον, ὅτι καλὸν
25 εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ.
26 Καὶ ἐγενήθη σωτηρία μεγάλη τῷ Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ. Ὅσοι δὲ τῶν ἀλλοφύλων διεσώθησαν, παραγεννηθέντες ἀπήγγειλαν τῷ Λυσίᾳ πάντα τὰ συμβεβηκότα.
27 Ὁ δὲ ἀκούσας πάντα συνεχύθη καὶ ἠθύμει, ὅτι οὐχ οἷα ἤθελε, τοιαῦτα γέγονε τῷ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ οὐχ οἷα ἐνετείλατο
28 αὐτῷ ὁ βασιλεύς, τοιαῦτα ἐξέβη. Καὶ ἐν τῷ ἐχομένῳ ἐνιαυτῷ συνελόχησεν ὁ Λυσίας ἀνδρῶν ἐπιλέκτων ἑξήκοντα χιλιάδας καὶ
29 πεντακισχιλίαν ἵππον, ὥστε ἐκπολεμῆσαι αὐτούς.
30 Καὶ ἦλθον εἰς τὴν Ἰδουμαίαν, καὶ παρενέβαλον ἐν Βαιθσούροις, καὶ συνήντησεν αὐτοῖς Ἰούδας ἐν δέκα χιλιάσιν ἀνδρῶν. Καὶ ἴδε τὴν παρεμβολὴν
31 ἰσχυράν, καὶ προσηύξατο, καὶ εἶπεν· εὐλογητὸς εἶ ὁ σωτὴρ τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ ὁ συντρίψας τὸ ὅρμημα τοῦ δυνατοῦ ἐν χειρὶ τοῦ δούλου σου Δαυίδ, καὶ παρέδωκας τὴν παρεμβολὴν τῶν ἀλλοφύλων εἰς χεῖρας Ἰωνάθου υἱοῦ Σαοὺλ καὶ τοῦ αἴροντος τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ.
32 Σύγκλεισον τὴν παρεμβολὴν ταύτην εἰς χεῖρας λαοῦ σου Ἰσραήλ,

**Chapter 4**

**13** Then the aliens lifted up their eyes, and beheld them coming against them.
**14** And they came forth out of the camp to battle; and those with Judas sounded the trumpets.
**15** And they joined battle, and the nations were shattered, and fled into the plain. All the rest of them fell by the sword; and [the Jews] pursued them even unto Gazara, and unto the plains of Idumaea, and unto Azotus, and unto Jamnia.
**16** And there fell of them about three thousand men.
**17** And Judas and his host returned from pursuing after them, and he said unto the people,
**18** "Covet ye not the spoils, for a war [yet remaineth] against us; for Gorgias and his host are in the mountain near unto us.
**19** But stand ye now against our enemies, and fight against them; and after these things, take ye the spoils with boldness."
**20** While Judas was yet speaking these words, there was seen a part [of them] looking forth from the mountain.
**21** And [he] saw that [the enemy] was put to rout, and that they did set fire to the camp; for the smoke that was seen did manifest the thing that had come to pass.
**22** But they, perceiving these things, were exceedingly afraid; and perceiving also the camp of Judas to be ready for battle array in the plain, they all fled into
**23** the land of the foreigners.
**24** And Judas returned unto the spoiling of the camp; and he took much gold and silver, and hyacinth, and purple, and sea-purple, and great riches. And having returned, they hymned and blessed the Lord in heaven, for His mercy endureth forever.
**25** And there was great salvation wrought for Israel on that day.
**26** And as many of the foreigners as were saved, came and reported unto Lysias all the things that had come to pass.
**27** But when he heard all, he was confounded and dismayed, for things had not fallen out for Israel according as he desired, and not such things as the king had
**28** commanded him, so had they turned out. And in the following year, Lysias assembled sixty thousand chosen men and
**29** five thousand horsemen, that he might make war against them.
**30** And they came into Idumaea, and encamped in Bethsura; and Judas met them with ten thousand men. And he beheld the camp
**31** to be strong; and he prayed, and said, "Blessed art Thou, O Savior of Israel, who didst crush the assault of the mighty man by the hand of Thy servant David, and didst deliver the host of the foreigners into the hands of Jonathan, the son of Saul, and of him that carried his armor.
**32** Shut up this host into the hands of Thy people Israel,
