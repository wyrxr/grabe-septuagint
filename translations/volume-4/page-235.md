**17** χαρίζει ἔσχατα δικαίων, καὶ ἀλαζονεύεται πατέρα Θεόν. Ἴδωμεν εἰ οἱ λόγοι αὐτοῦ ἀληθεῖς, καὶ πειράσωμεν τὰ ἐν ἐκβάσει αὐτοῦ.
**18** Εἰ γάρ ἐστιν ὁ δίκαιος υἱὸς Θεοῦ, ἀντιλήψεται αὐτοῦ,
**19** καὶ ῥύσεται αὐτὸν ἐκ χειρὸς ἀνθεστηκότων· ὕβρει καὶ βασάνῳ ἐτάσωμεν αὐτόν, ἵνα γνῶμεν τὴν ἐπιείκειαν αὐτοῦ, καὶ δοκιμάσωμεν τὴν ἀνεξικακίαν αὐτοῦ.
**20** Θανάτῳ ἀσχήμονι καταδικάσωμεν αὐτόν, ἔσται γὰρ αὐτοῦ ἐπισκοπὴ ἐκ λόγων αὐτοῦ.
**21** Ταῦτα ἐλογίσαντο, καὶ ἐπλανήθησαν· ἀπετύφλωσε γὰρ αὐτοὺς ἡ κακία αὐτῶν,
**22** καὶ οὐκ ἔγνωσαν μυστήρια Θεοῦ, οὐδὲ μισθὸν ἤλπισαν ὁσιότητος,
**23** οὐδὲ ἔκριναν γέρας ψυχῶν ἀμώμων. Ὅτι ὁ Θεὸς ἔκτισε τὸν ἄνθρωπον ἐπ’ ἀφθαρσίᾳ, καὶ εἰκόνα τῆς ἰδίας ἀϊδιότητος ἐποίησεν αὐτόν·
**24** φθόνῳ δὲ διαβόλου θάνατος εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸν κόσμον·
**25** πειράζουσι δὲ αὐτὸν οἱ τῆς ἐκείνου μερίδος ὄντες.

**1** ΔΙΚΑΙΩΝ δὲ ψυχαὶ ἐν χειρὶ Θεοῦ, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἅψηται αὐτῶν βάσανος.
**2** Ἔδοξαν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς ἀφρόνων τεθνάναι, καὶ ἐλογίσθη
**3** κάκωσις ἡ ἔξοδος αὐτῶν, καὶ ἡ ἀφ’ ἡμῶν πορεία σύντριμμα· οἱ δέ εἰσιν ἐν εἰρήνῃ.
**4** Καὶ γὰρ ἐν ὄψει ἀνθρώπων ἐὰν κολασθῶσιν, ἡ
**5** ἐλπὶς αὐτῶν ἀθανασίας πλήρης· καὶ ὀλίγα παιδευθέντες, μεγάλα εὐεργετηθήσονται. Ὅτι ὁ Θεὸς ἐπείρασεν αὐτοὺς καὶ εὗρεν αὐτοὺς
**6** ἀξίους ἑαυτοῦ· ὡς χρυσὸν ἐν χωνευτηρίῳ ἐδοκίμασεν αὐτοὺς, καὶ
**7** ὡς ὁλοκάρπωμα θυσίας προσεδέξατο αὐτούς. Καὶ ἐν καιρῷ ἐπισκοπῆς αὐτῶν ἀναλάμψουσι, καὶ ὡς σπινθῆρες ἐν καλάμῃ διαδραμοῦνται·
**8** κρινοῦσιν ἔθνη καὶ κρατήσουσι λαῶν, καὶ βασιλεύσει αὐτῶν Κύριος εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας.
**9** Οἱ πεποιθότες ἐπ’ αὐτῷ συνήσουσιν ἀλήθειαν, καὶ οἱ πιστοὶ ἐν ἀγάπῃ προσμενοῦσιν αὐτῷ· ὅτι χάρις καὶ ἔλεος ἐν τοῖς ἐκλεκτοῖς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπισκοπὴ ἐν τοῖς
**10** ὁσίοις αὐτοῦ. Οἱ δὲ ἀσεβεῖς καθὰ ἐλογίσαντο, ἕξουσιν ἐπιτιμίαν, οἱ ἀμελήσαντες τοῦ δικαίου, καὶ τοῦ Κυρίου ἀποστάντες·
**11** Σοφίαν γὰρ καὶ παιδείαν ὁ ἐξουθενῶν ταλαίπωρος, καὶ κενὴ ἡ ἐλπὶς αὐτῶν, καὶ οἱ κόποι ἀνόνητοι, καὶ ἄχρηστα τὰ ἔργα αὐτῶν·

**CHAPTER II.**

**17** He doth boast of the latter end of the righteous, and doth vaunt of God as his Father. Let us see if his words be true, and let us prove what shall be in his end.
**18** For if the righteous man be the Son of God, He will uphold him,
**19** and shall deliver him from the hand of those that resist him. With insult and with torment let us test him, that we may know his gentleness, and may prove his patience in suffering evil.
**20** Let us condemn him to a shameful death; for his visitation shall be by his own words.
**21** These things did they imagine, and they were led astray; for their own wickedness did blind them,
**22** and they knew not the mysteries of God, neither did they hope for the recompense of holiness,
**23** nor did they discern the reward of blameless souls. For God created man for incorruption, and made him in the image of His own eternity.
**24** But by the envy of the devil did death enter into the world;
**25** and they that are of his portion do tempt [man].

**CHAPTER III.**

**1** But the souls of the righteous are in the hand of God, and no torment shall ever touch them.
**2** In the eyes of the foolish, they seemed to have died, and their departure was accounted as
**3** affliction their exodus, and their going forth from us as utter destruction. But they are in peace.
**4** For even if in the sight of men they be chastened, their
**5** hope is full of immortality. And having been disciplined a little, they shall be greatly blessed. For God did test them, and found them
**6** worthy of Himself. As gold in the furnace did He prove them, and
**7** as a whole burnt offering of sacrifice did He accept them. And in the time of their visitation, they shall shine forth, and as sparks among reeds shall they
**8** run to and fro. They shall judge nations and shall have dominion over peoples, and the Lord shall reign
**9** over them for ever. They who trust in Him shall understand truth, and they who are faithful in love shall abide with Him. For grace and mercy are with His elect, and a visitation among His
**10** holy ones. But the ungodly shall have punishment, according as they have reckoned; even they who neglected the righteous, and apostatized from the Lord.
**11** For he who despiseth wisdom and discipline is wretched; and their hope is vain, and their labors unprofitable, and their works are worthless.
**12** Their wives are foolish, and their children are wicked,
**13** and accursed is their progeny. For blessed is the undefiled barren woman, who knew not a bed in transgression; she shall have fruit in the visitation of
