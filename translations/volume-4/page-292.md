καὶ οἱ δεσμοὶ αὐτῆς δεσμοὶ χάλκεοι· θάνατος πονηρὸς ὁ θάνατος 21
αὐτῆς, καὶ λυσιτελὴς μᾶλλον ὁ ᾅδης αὐτῆς. Οὐ μὴ κρατήσῃ εὐ- 22
σεβῶν, καὶ ἐν τῇ φλογὶ αὐτῆς οὐ μὴ κρατήσονται· οἱ καταλείποντες 23
Κύριον ἐμπεσοῦνται εἰς αὐτήν, καὶ ἐν αὐτῇ ἐκκαήσεται, καὶ οὐ 24
σβεσθῇ· ἐπαποσταλήσεται αὐτοῖς ὡς λέων, καὶ ὡς πάρδαλις λυ- 25
μαίνεται αὐτούς. Ἴδε, περίφραξον τὸ κτῆμά σου ἀκάνθαις, τὸ
ἀργύριόν σου καὶ τὸ χρυσίον κατάδησον· καὶ τοῖς λόγοις σου ποίη-
σον ζυγὸν καὶ σταθμόν, καὶ τῷ στόματί σου ποίησον θύραν καὶ
μοχλόν· πρόσεχε μήπως ὀλισθῇς ἐν αὐτῇ, μὴ πέσῃς κατέναντι 26
ἐνεδρεύοντος.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΘʹ. ΧΧΙΧ.

Ὁ ποιῶν ἔλεος δανιεῖ τῷ πλησίον· καὶ ὁ ἐπισχύων τῇ χειρὶ 1
αὐτοῦ ποιεῖ ἐντολάς. Δάνισον τῷ πλησίον ἐν καιρῷ χρείας αὐτοῦ, 2
καὶ πάλιν ἀπόδος τῷ πλησίον εἰς καιρόν· στερέωσον λόγον σου, 3
καὶ πιστώθητι μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐν παντὶ καιρῷ εὑρήσεις τὴν 4
χρείαν σου. Πολλοὶ ὡς εὕρεμα ἐνόμιζον δάνος, καὶ παρέσχον κό- 5
πον τοῖς βοηθήσασιν αὐτοῖς· ἕως οὗ λάβῃ, καταφιλήσει χεῖρας
αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν χρημάτων τοῦ πλησίον ταπεινώσει φωνὴν καὶ
ἐν καιρῷ ἀποδόσεως παρελκύσει χρόνον, καὶ ἀποδώσει λόγους 6
ἀκηδίας, καὶ τὸν καιρὸν αἰτιάσεται. Ἐὰν ἰσχύσῃ ὁ δοὺς, μόλις
κομιεῖται τὸ ἥμισυ, καὶ λογιεῖται αὐτὸ ὡς εὕρεμα· εἰ δὲ μὴ, ἀπε-
στέρησεν αὐτὸν τῶν χρημάτων αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐκτήσατο αὐτὸν ἐχθρὸν
δωρεάν· κατάρχει καὶ λοιδορίας ἀποδώσει αὐτῷ, καὶ ἀντὶ δόξης 7
ἀποδώσει αὐτῷ ἀτιμίαν. Πολλοὶ οὖν χάριν πονηρίας ἀπέστρεψαν
ἄνθρωπον· ἀποστερηθῆναι δὲ δωρεὰν εὐλόγησαν. Πλὴν ἐπὶ τα- 8
πεινῷ μακροθύμησον, καὶ ἐπὶ ἐλεημοσύνῃ μὴ παρελκύσῃς αὐτόν· 9
χάριν ἐντολῆς ἀντιλαβοῦ πένητος, καὶ κατὰ τὴν ἔνδειαν αὐτοῦ μὴ
ἀποστρέψῃς αὐτὸν κενόν. Ἀπόλεσον ἀργύριον διὰ ἀδελφὸν καὶ φί- 10
λον, καὶ μὴ ἰωθήτω ὑπὸ τὸν λίθον εἰς ἀπώλειαν. Θὲς τὸν θησαυρόν 11
σου κατ᾽ ἐντολὰς ὑψίστου, καὶ λυσιτελήσει σοι μᾶλλον ἢ τὸ χρυ- 12
σίου. Σύγκλεισον ἐλεημοσύνην ἐν τοῖς ταμείοις σου, καὶ αὕτη ἐξε- 13
λεῖταί σε ἐκ πάσης κακώσεως· ὑπὲρ ἀσπίδα κράτους, καὶ ὑπὲρ δό- 14
ρυ ἀλκῆς κατέναντι ἐχθροῦ πολεμήσει ὑπὲρ σοῦ. Ἀνὴρ ἀγαθὸς
ἐγγυήσεται τὸν πλησίον, καὶ ὁ ἀπολωλεκὼς αἰσχύνην ἐγκαταλείψει 19
(Τόμ. Δʹ.)

**Chapter Twenty-Eight**

21 And its bonds are bonds of bronze;
    a wicked death is its death,
    and more profitable is its Hades.
22 It shall not prevail against the righteous,
    and in its flame shall they not be held;
23 but they that forsake the Lord shall fall into it,
    and in it shall they be kindled, and shall not be quenched.
24 It shall be sent upon them as a lion,
    and as a leopard shall it ravage them.
25 Behold, enclose thy possession with thorns;
    bind up thy silver and thy gold;
    and for thy words make a yoke and a balance,
    and for thy mouth make a door and a bolt.
26 Take heed lest thou slip therein,
    lest thou fall before one that lieth in wait.

**Chapter Twenty-Nine**

1 He that showeth mercy shall lend unto his neighbor;
    and he that strengtheneth his hand doth perform the commandments.
2 Lend unto thy neighbor in the time of his need,
    and again repay unto thy neighbor in due season.
3 Confirm thy word, and be faithful with him;
    and in every time shalt thou find thine own need.
4 Many have deemed a loan as a treasure found,
    and have caused trouble unto them that helped them.
5 Until he receive it, he will kiss the hands of his benefactor,
    and for the money of his neighbor will he humble his voice;
6 and in the time of repayment will he prolong the season,
    and will speak words of heedlessness, and blame the opportune time.
7 If the lender be mighty, scarce shall he recover the half,
    and shall count it as a thing found;
    but if not, he hath been deprived of his money,
    and hath gotten himself an enemy for naught.
    He beginneth also to utter reproaches against him,
    and instead of glory shall he render unto him dishonor.
8 Many therefore, by reason of [their] wickedness, have turned away a man;
    and have blessed [themselves to be] deprived [of their money] for naught.
9 Nevertheless, be long-suffering unto the lowly,
    and for charity's sake do not delay him.
10 For the commandment's sake, take hold of the poor,
    and according to his want turn him not away empty.
11 Lose thy silver for thy brother and thy friend,
    and let it not be corrupted beneath the stone unto destruction.
12 Lay up thy treasure according to the commandments of the Most High,
    and it shall profit thee more than gold.
13 Shut up alms in thy storehouses,
    and the same shall deliver thee from all adversity;
14 it shall fight for thee against thine enemy,
    more than a shield of strength and more than a spear of might.
19 A good man will be surety for his neighbor;
    and he that hath lost shame shall abandon him.
