19 Ἐξαίφνης δύο φοβεροειδεῖς ἄγγελοι κατέβησαν φανεροὶ πᾶσι πλὴν τοῖς Ἰουδαίοις, καὶ ἀντέστησαν, καὶ τὴν δύναμιν τῶν ὑπεναντίων ἐπλήρωσαν ταραχῆς καὶ δειλίας, καὶ ἀκινήτοις ἔδησαν πέδαις.
20 Καὶ ὑπόφρικος καὶ τὸ τοῦ βασιλέως σῶμα ἐγενήθη· καὶ λήθη
21 τὸ θράσος αὐτοῦ τὸ βαρύθυμον ἔλαβε. Καὶ ἀπέστρεψαν τὰ θηρία ἐπὶ τὰς συνεπομένας ἐνόπλους δυνάμεις, καὶ κατεπάτουν αὐτὰς, καὶ ὠλέθρευον.
22 Καὶ μετεστράφη τοῦ βασιλέως ἡ ὀργὴ εἰς οἶκτον καὶ δάκρυα ὑπὲρ τῶν ἔμπροσθεν αὐτῷ μεμηχανευμένων.
23 Ἀκούσας γὰρ τῆς κραυγῆς, καὶ συνιδὼν πρηνεῖς ἅπαντας εἰς τὴν ἀπώλειαν, δακρύσας μετ᾿ ὀργῆς τοῖς φίλοις διηπείλειτο, λέγων:
24 Παραβασιλεύετε, καὶ τυράννους ὑπερβεβήκατε ὠμότητι· καὶ ἐμὲ αὐτὸν τὸν ὑμῶν εὐεργέτην ἐπιχειρεῖτε τῆς ἀρχῆς ἤδη καὶ τοῦ πνεύματος μεθιστᾶν, λάθρα μηχανώμενοι τὰ μὴ συμφέροντα τῇ
25 βασιλεία. Τίς τοὺς κρατήσαντας ἡμῶν ἐν πίστει τὰ τῆς χώρας ὀχυρώματα τῆς οἰκίας ἀποστήσας, ἕκαστον ἀλόγως ἤθροισεν ἐνθάδε;
26 Τίς τοὺς ἐξαρχῆς εὐνοίᾳ πρὸς ἡμᾶς κατὰ πάντα διαφέροντας πάντων ἐθνῶν, καὶ τοὺς χειρίστους πλεονάκις ἀνθρώπων ἐπιδεδεγμένους κινδύνους, οὕτως ἀθέσμοις περιέβαλεν αἰκίαις;
27 Λύσατε, ἐκλύσατε ἄδικα δεσμά· εἰς τὰ ἴδια μετ᾿ εἰρήνης ἐξαποστείλατε, τὰ προπεπραγμένα παραιτησάμενοι.
28 Ἀπολύσατε τοὺς υἱοὺς τοῦ παντοκράτορος ἐπουρανίου Θεοῦ ζῶντος, ὃς ἀφ᾿ ἡμετέρων μέχρι τοῦ νῦν προγόνων ἀπαρράκτιστον εὐστάθειαν μετὰ δόξης παρέχει τοῖς ἡμετέροις πράγμασιν.
29 Ὁ μὲν οὖν ταῦτα ἐξέλεξεν· οἱ δὲ ἐν ἀμερεῖ χρόνῳ λυθέντες, τὸν ἅγιον σωτῆρα Θεὸν αὐτὸν ηὐλόγουν, ἄρτι τὸν θάνατον ἐκπεφυγότες.
30 Εἶτα ὁ βασιλεὺς εἰς τὴν πόλιν ἀπαλλαγεὶς, τὸν ἐπὶ τῶν προσόδων προσκαλεσάμενος, ἐκέλευσεν οἴνους τε καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ πρὸς εὐωχίαν ἐπιτήδεια τοῖς Ἰουδαίοις χορηγεῖν ἐπὶ ἡμέρας ἑπτὰ, κρίνας αὐτοὺς, ἐν ᾧ τόπῳ ἔδοξαν τὸν ὄλεθρον ἀναλαμβάνειν, ἐν τούτῳ ἐν εὐφροσύνῃ πάσῃ σωτηρία ἀγαγεῖν.
31 Τότε οἱ τὸ πρὶν ἐπονείδισοι καὶ πλησίον τοῦ ἅδου, μᾶλλον δὲ ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ βεβηκότες, ἀντὶ πικροῦ καὶ δυστιάκτου μόρου, κώθωνα σωτήριον συστησάμενοι, τὸν εἰς πτῶσιν αὐτοῖς καὶ τάφον ἡτοιμασμένον τόπον κλισίαις κατεμερίσαντο πλήρεις χαρμονῆς.
32 Καταλήξαντες δὲ θρήνων πανόδυρτον μέλος, ἀνέλαβον ᾠδὴν πάτριον, τὸν Ἰσραὴλ σωτῆρα καὶ τερατοποιὸν αἰνοῦντες Θεόν· οἰμωγὴν δὲ πᾶσαν καὶ κωκυτὸν

**III Maccabees, Chapter 7**

**19** Suddenly two fearful-looking angels descended, manifest to all, save only to the Jews; and they stood against [them], and filled the might of the adversaries with confusion and terror, and bound them with immovable fetters.
**20** And the king himself was terrified, yea, even his body was made to tremble;
**21** and forgetfulness took hold of his ill-tempered insolence. And the beasts turned upon the armed forces that accompanied them, and trampled them, and utterly destroyed them.
**22** And the king's wrath was turned into pity and tears for the things previously contrived by him.
**23** For when he heard the cry, and perceived all to be prostrate unto destruction, weeping with wrath, he threatened his friends, saying:
**24** "Ye play the tyrant, and have surpassed tyrants in cruelty; and ye attempt to remove me, your very benefactor, from my rule and even from life, secretly plotting things not expedient for the kingdom.
**25** Who, having removed those who faithfully held the strongholds of our land from their own homes, hath unreasonably gathered each one here?
**26** Who hath thus encompassed with lawless torments those who from the beginning have surpassed all nations in their goodwill toward us, and have oft endured the direst of dangers for mankind?"
**27** "Loose ye, and set free these unjust bonds; send them away unto their own homes with peace, having remitted the things heretofore committed.
**28** Release the sons of the Almighty living Heavenly God, Who from our forefathers even until now hath granted an unshaken stability with glory unto our affairs."
**29** Thus he declared these things; and they, being loosed in an instant, blessed God Himself, their holy Savior, having just then escaped death.
**30** Then the king, having departed to the city, and having called unto him him that was over the revenues, commanded that wines and other things suitable for feasting should be provided for the Jews for seven days, judging that in the very place where they had expected to receive destruction, there they should celebrate their salvation with all gladness.
**31** Then they, who before had been reviled, and were nigh unto Hades, nay, rather, standing upon it, instead of a bitter and unendurable death, having established a saving banquet, divided the place prepared for their downfall and grave into feasting-groups, full of joy.
**32** And having ceased their all-lamenting song of wailing, they took up an ancestral hymn, praising God, the Savior and Wonder-Worker of Israel; and having cast aside all lamentation and wailing,
