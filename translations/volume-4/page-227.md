ΒΑΡΟΥΧ ΚΕΦ. Δ΄. Ε΄.
26 τραχήλους αὐτῶν ἐπιβήσῃ. Οἱ τρυφεροί μου ἐπορεύθησαν ὁδοὺς
27 τραχείας, ἤρθησαν ὡς ποίμνιον ἡρπασμένον ὑπὸ ἐχθρῶν. Θαρ-
   σήσατε, τέκνα, καὶ βοήσατε πρὸς τὸν Θεόν, ἔσται γὰρ ὑμῶν ὑπὸ
28 τοῦ ἐπάγοντος μνεία. Ὥσπερ γὰρ ἐγένετο ἡ διάνοια ὑμῶν εἰς τὸ
   πλανηθῆναι ὑμᾶς ἀπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ, οὕτω νῦν δεκαπλασιάσατε ἐπι-
29 στραφέντες ζητῆσαι αὐτόν. Ὁ γὰρ ἐπαγαγὼν ὑμῖν τὰ κακά,
   ἐπάξει ὑμῖν τὴν αἰώνιον εὐφροσύνην μετὰ τῆς σωτηρίας ὑμῶν.
30. 31 Θάρσει Ἱερουσαλήμ, παρακαλεῖ σε ὁ ὀνομάσας σε. Δείλαιοι οἱ
32 σὲ κακώσαντες, καὶ ἐπιχαρέντες τῇ σῇ πτώσει, δείλαιαι αἱ πόλεις,
   αἷς ἐδούλευσαν τὰ τέκνα σου, δειλαία ἡ δεξαμένη τοὺς υἱούς σου.
33 Ὥσπερ γὰρ ἐχάρη ἐπὶ τῇ σῇ πτώσει, καὶ ηὐφράνθη ἐπὶ πτώματί
34 σου, οὕτως λυπηθήσεται ἐπὶ τῇ ἑαυτῆς ἐρημίᾳ. Καὶ περιελῶ αὐ-
   τῆς τὰ ἀγαλλίαμα τῆς πολυγονίας, καὶ τὸ ἀγαλλίαμα αὐτῆς ἔσται
35 εἰς πένθος. Πῦρ γὰρ ἐπελεύσεται αὐτῇ παρὰ τοῦ αἰωνίου εἰς ἡμέ-
   ρας μακράς, καὶ κατοικηθήσεται ὑπὸ δαιμονίων τὸν πλείονα χρό-
36 νον. Περίβλεψαι πρὸς ἀνατολάς, Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἴδε τὴν εὐφρο-
37 σύνην τὴν παρὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ σοι ἐπερχομένην. Ἰδοὺ ἔρχονται οἱ
   υἱοί σου, οὓς ἐξαπέστειλας, συνηγμένοι ἔρχονται ἀπὸ ἀνατολῆς
   ἕως δυσμῶν τῷ ῥήματι τοῦ ἁγίου, χαίροντες τῇ τοῦ Θεοῦ δόξῃ.

ΚΕΦ. Ε΄. V.

1 ΕΚΔΥΣΑΙ, Ἱερουσαλήμ, τὴν στολὴν τοῦ πένθους καὶ τῆς
   κακώσεώς σου, καὶ ἔνδυσαι τὴν εὐπρέπειαν τῆς παρὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ
2 σοι δόξης εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα. Περιβαλοῦ τὴν διπλοΐδα τῆς παρὰ τοῦ
   Θεοῦ δικαιοσύνης, ἐπίθου τὴν μίτραν ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλήν σου τῆς
3 δόξης τοῦ αἰωνίου. Ὁ γὰρ Θεὸς δείξει τῇ ὑπ᾿ οὐρανὸν πάσῃ τὴν
4 σὴν λαμπρότητα. Κληθήσεται γάρ σου τὸ ὄνομα παρὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ εἰς
5 τὸν αἰῶνα, εἰρήνη δικαιοσύνης, καὶ δόξα θεοσεβείας. Ἀνάστηθι,
   Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ στῆθι ἐπὶ τοῦ ὑψηλοῦ, καὶ περίβλεψαι πρὸς ἀνα-
   τολάς, καὶ ἴδε σου συνηγμένα τὰ τέκνα ἀπὸ ἡλίου δυσμῶν καὶ ἕως
   ἀνατολῶν τῷ ῥήματι τοῦ ἁγίου, χαίροντας τῇ τοῦ Θεοῦ μνείᾳ.
6 Ἐξῆλθον γὰρ παρὰ σοῦ πεζοὶ ἀγόμενοι ὑπὸ ἐχθρῶν, εἰσάγει δὲ
   αὐτοὺς ὁ Θεὸς πρὸς σὲ αἰρουμένους μετὰ δόξης ὡς θρόνον βασι-
7 λείας. Συνέταξε γὰρ ὁ Θεὸς ταπεινοῦσθαι πᾶν ὄρος ὑψηλόν, καὶ
   βουνοὺς ἀεννάους, καὶ φάραγγας πληροῦσθαι εἰς ὁμαλισμὸν τῆς γῆς.

**CHAPTER IV.**

**26** necks shall you set your foot. My pampered ones have journeyed on rugged
**27** paths, and were led away as a flock plundered by their foes. Be of good
    courage, O my children, and cry out unto God, for there shall be a remembrance of you by Him
**28** who brought [these things upon you]. For as your intent was to stray
    from God, so now, when you have turned, increase tenfold your seeking of
**29** Him. For He that brought these evils upon you shall
    bring unto you eternal joy together with your salvation.
**30. 31** Take courage, O Jerusalem, He that called you by name comforts you. Wretched are they
**32** that wrought evil against you, and took pleasure in your downfall; wretched are the cities,
    wherein your children were held in bondage; wretched is she who received your sons.
**33** For as she rejoiced at your fall, and was made glad at your overthrow,
**34** so shall she be grieved at her own desolation. And I shall take from her the
    joy of her [many] offspring, and her exultation shall be turned
**35** into mourning. For fire shall come upon her from the Everlasting for many
    days, and she shall be inhabited by demons for a very long
**36** season. Gaze toward the East, O Jerusalem, and see the joy
**37** that comes upon you from God. Behold, your sons come, whom you sent forth;
    they come gathered from East to West by the word of the Holy One,
    rejoicing in the glory of God.

**CHAPTER V.**

**1** PUT OFF, O Jerusalem, the garment of mourning and of your affliction,
    and put on the comeliness of the glory from God
**2** for you forevermore. Clothe yourself with the mantle of the
    righteousness [that comes] from God; set the diadem upon your head of the
**3** glory of the Everlasting. For God shall display to all under heaven
**4** your radiance. For your name shall be called by God forever,
    "Peace of Righteousness," and "Glory of Godliness."
**5** Arise, O Jerusalem, and stand upon the height, and look about you toward
    the East, and see your children gathered from the setting of the sun and even unto
    the rising thereof by the word of the Holy One, rejoicing in the remembrance of God.
**6** For they went forth from you on foot, led captive by enemies, but
    God brings them in unto you, borne aloft with glory as upon a royal
**7** throne. For God hath commanded every high mountain to be made low, and
    perennial hills, and valleys to be filled up for the leveling of the earth,
