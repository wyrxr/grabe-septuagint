**III Maccabees, Chapter 3**

**28** [one] shall receive the property of him that falleth under judgement, and from the king’s treasury two thousand drachmas of silver, and shall attain unto his freedom, and shall be crowned.
**29** And every place, where a Jew shall be found to be sheltered, let it become impassable and burnt to ashes; and unto every mortal creature shall it appear altogether useless for all time.
**30** And the tenor of the epistle was thus written.

**III Maccabees, Chapter 4**

**1** But wheresoever this decree did reach, there did public celebration arise among the Gentiles, with feasting, with shouts of joy and gladness; as if the hatred, which had long before been rooted in their minds, was now revealed with boldness.
**2** But unto the Jews, there was unceasing mourning and a cry of all-lamentation, accompanied by tears, their hearts being inflamed on every side with groans; as they did bewail the unexpected freedom suddenly adjudged upon them.
**3** What province, or city, or what habitable place altogether, or what streets were not filled with lamentation and wailing over them?
**4** For they were thus sent forth by the generals of the cities with bitter and pitiless soul, with one accord; so that even some of their enemies, having before their eyes the common mercy [due to man], and considering the uncertain overthrow of life, did weep at their most miserable expulsion.
**5** For there was led away a multitude of old men, covered with hoary hair, bowed down by the slowness of their feet owing to age, [and] by the violent impetus of their overthrow; and without all reverence, were they cast forth into a swift journey.
**6** And young maidens, who had but lately entered the nuptial chamber for the communion of life, did receive lamentations instead of joys; and their hair, anointed with perfume, being defiled with dust, and they themselves being led unveiled, did with one accord pour forth a lament instead of wedding songs, as if they were torn asunder by the plunderings of foreign nations.
**7** And publicly bound, these women were dragged by force even unto their embarkation into the ship.
**8** And those joined to them [in wedlock], having their necks entwined with nooses instead of crowns, though in the prime and vigour of youth, did spend the remaining days of their marriage in lamentations instead of feasting and youthful cheer, seeing Hades already laid at their feet.
**9** And they were led down like wild beasts, compelled by iron bonds;
