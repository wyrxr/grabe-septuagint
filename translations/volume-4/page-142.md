**ΚΕΦ. Γ΄.**
**33** ἐσθήσεσιν ἐστολισμένοι, καὶ [προσφωνήσαντες] πάντες
λέγουσιν· Τῷ ἀρχιερεῖ χάριτας ἔχε, διὰ γὰρ αὐτὸν σοὶ κεχάρισται τὸ ζῆν ὁ Κύ-
**34** ριος. Σὺ δὲ ἐξ οὐρανοῦ μεμαστιγωμένος διάγγελλε πᾶσι τὸ μεγαλεῖον τοῦ Θεοῦ κράτος· ταῦτα δὲ εἰπόντες ἀφανεῖς ἐγένοντο.
**35** Ὁ δὲ Ἡλιόδωρος θυσίαν ἀνενεγκὼν τῷ Θεῷ, καὶ εὐχὰς μεγίστας εὐξάμενος τῷ τὸ ζῆν περιποιήσαντι, καὶ τὸν Ὀνίαν ἀποδε-
ξάμενος, ἀνεστρατοπέδευσε πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα.
**36** Ἐξεμαρτύρει δὲ πᾶσιν ἅπερ ἦν ὑπ᾽ ὄψιν τεθεαμένος ἔργα τοῦ μεγίστου Θεοῦ.
**37** Τοῦ δὲ βασιλέως ἐπερωτήσαντος τὸν Ἡλιόδωρον, ποῖός τις εἴη ἐπιτήδειος ἔτι ἅπαξ διαπεμφθῆναι εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα, ἔφησεν·
**38** Εἴ τινα ἔχεις πολέμιον ἢ πραγμάτων ἐπίβουλον, πέμψον αὐτὸν ἐκεῖ καὶ μεμαστιγωμένον αὐτὸν προσδέξῃ, ἐάν περ καὶ διασωθῇ, διὰ τὸ περὶ τὸν τόπον ἀληθῶς εἶναι τινα Θεοῦ δύναμιν.
**39** Αὐτὸς γὰρ ὁ τὴν κατοικίαν ἐπουράνιον ἔχων, ἐπόπτης ἐστὶ καὶ βοηθὸς ἐκείνου τοῦ τόπου, καὶ τοὺς παραγινομένους ἐπὶ κακώσει τύπτων ἀπολλύει.
**40** Καὶ τὰ μὲν κατ᾽ Ἡλιόδωρον καὶ τὴν τοῦ γαζοφυλακίου τήρησιν οὕτως ἐχώρησεν.

**ΚΕΦ. Δ΄.**
**1** Ὁ δὲ προειρημένος Σίμων, ὁ τῶν χρημάτων καὶ τῆς πατρίδος ἐνδείκτης γεγονώς, ἐκακολόγει τὸν Ὀνίαν, ὡς οὗτός τε εἴη τὸν Ἡλιόδωρον ἐπισεσεικὼς, καὶ τῶν κακῶν δημιουργὸς καθεστηκώς.
**2** Καὶ τὸν εὐεργέτην τῆς πόλεως καὶ τὸν κηδεμόνα τῶν ὁμοεθνῶν καὶ ζηλωτὴν τῶν νόμων, ἐπίβουλον τῶν πραγμάτων ἐτόλμα λέγειν.
**3** Τῆς δὲ ἔχθρας ἐπὶ τοσοῦτον προβαινούσης, ὥστε καὶ διά τινος τῶν ὑπὸ τοῦ Σίμωνος δεδοκιμασμένων φόνους συντελεῖσθαι,
**4** συνορῶν Ὀνίας τὸ χαλεπὸν τῆς φιλονεικίας καὶ Ἀπολλώνιον μαίνεσθαι, ὡς τὸν Κοίλης Συρίας καὶ Φοινίκης στρατηγὸν, συναύξοντα τὴν κακίαν τοῦ Σίμωνος, πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα διεκωμίσθη·
**5** οὐ γινόμενος τῶν πολιτῶν κατήγορος, τὸ δὲ σύμφορον κοινῇ καὶ κατ᾽ ἰδίαν παντὶ τῷ πλήθει σκοπῶν.
**6** Ἑώρα γὰρ ἄνευ βασιλικῆς προνοίας ἀδύνατον εἶναι τυχεῖν εἰρήνης ἔτι τὰ πράγματα, καὶ τὸν Σίμωνα παῦλαν οὐ λήψομενον τῆς ἀνοίας.
**7** Μεταλλάξαντος δὲ τὸν βίον Σελεύκου, καὶ παραλαβόντος τὴν βασιλείαν Ἀντιόχου τοῦ προσγορευθέντος Ἐπιφανοῦς,

#### CHAPTER III.

**33** ...raiment, and all of them did say, calling out [unto him]: Render thanks unto the high priest, for through him hath the Lord granted thee thy life.
**34** But thou, having been scourged from heaven, declare unto all the magnificent might of God. And when they had spoken these words, they vanished from sight.
**35** So Heliodorus, having offered a sacrifice unto God, and having made exceeding great vows unto Him who had preserved his life, and having taken leave of Onias, did return unto the king.
**36** And he did bear witness unto all men of those things which he had beheld with his own eyes, even the works of the Most Great God.
**37** And when the king had enquired of Heliodorus, who might be a fit man to be sent yet once again unto Jerusalem, he made answer and said:
**38** If thou hast any foe or any plotter against the commonwealth, send him thither, and thou shalt receive him scourged, if indeed he should even escape with his life, because there is verily a divine power concerning that place.
**39** For He Himself, who hath His dwelling in heaven, is the Overseer and Helper of that place, and smiteth and destroyeth them that come thither for to do mischief.
**40** And thus did the matters concerning Heliodorus and the guarding of the treasury proceed.

#### CHAPTER IV.

**1** Now the afore-mentioned Simon, who had become an informer against the treasures and his native land, did speak ill of Onias, alleging that he it was who had stirred up Heliodorus, and who was made the author of these evils.
**2** And him who was a benefactor of the city, and a guardian of his own nation, and zealous for the laws, he dared to call a plotter against the state.
**3** And the enmity did advance to such a degree, that even through some of those who were approved of by Simon, murders were committed.
**4** Then Onias, perceiving the grievousness of the contention, and that Apollonius, as the general of Coele-Syria and Phoenicia, was raging with fury and increasing the wickedness of Simon, conveyed himself unto the king;
**5** not becoming an accuser of the citizens, but considering what was profitable generally and individually for all the multitude.
**6** For he saw that without royal foresight it was impossible for affairs to obtain peace any longer, and that Simon would not cease from his folly.
**7** And when Seleucus had departed this life, and Antiochus, who was surnamed Epiphanes, had taken over the kingdom,
