τοῦ, καὶ ἐν ὀνόματι αὐτοῦ καυχήσασθαι· καὶ ἐδευτέρωσαν ἐν προς- 21
κυνήσει, ἐπιδεῖξαι τὴν εὐλογίαν παρὰ ὑψίστου· καὶ νῦν
εὐλογήσατε τῷ Θεῷ πάντων τῷ μεγάλῳ ποιοῦντι πάντα, τὸν
ὀξύντοντα ἡμέρας ἡμῶν ἐκ μητρός, καὶ ποιοῦντα μεθ᾿ ἡμῶν
κατὰ τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ· Δῴη ἡμῖν εὐφροσύνην καρδίας, καὶ γε- 22
νέσθαι εἰρήνην ἐν ἡμέραις ἡμῶν ἐν Ἰσραὴλ κατὰ τὰς ἡμέ-
ρας τοῦ αἰῶνος · ἐμπιστεῦσαι μεθ᾿ ἡμῶν τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ, 23
καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἡμῶν λυτρωσάσθω ἡμᾶς. Ἐν δυσὶν ἔθνεσι 24
προσώχθισεν ἡ ψυχή μου, καὶ τὸ τρίτον οὐκ ἔστιν ἔθνος·
οἱ καθήμενοι ἐν ὄρει Σαμαρείας, καὶ Φυλιστιείμ, καὶ ὁ λαὸς ὁ μω- 25

ἐχάραξεν ἐν τῷ βιβλίῳ τούτῳ Ἰησοῦς υἱὸς Σειρὰχ Ἐλεάζαρ ὁ
Ἱεροσολυμίτης, ὃς ἀνώρθωσε σοφίαν ἀπὸ καρδίας αὐτοῦ. Μα- 27
κάριος ὃς ἐν τούτοις ἀναστραφήσεται, καὶ θεὶς αὐτὰ ἐπὶ καρδίαν
αὐτοῦ σοφισθήσεται· ἐὰν γὰρ ταῦτα ποιήσῃ, πρὸς πάντα ἰσχύσει, 28
ὅτι φῶς Κυρίου τὸ ἴχνος αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοῖς εὐσεβέσιν ἔδωκε σο-
φίαν. Εὐλογητὸς Κύριος εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα· γένοιτο, γένοιτο. 29

20 of Him, and to glory in His Name.
Then did they bow down a second time in worship,
21 to show forth the blessing from the Most High.
And now, bless ye the God of all, the Great One who maketh all things,
who doth ordain our days from the womb,
and who dealeth with us according to His mercy.
22 May He grant unto us gladness of heart,
and that peace may be in our days in Israel throughout all ages;
23 and may His mercy abide with us,
and in our days may He redeem us.
24 In two nations did my soul take offense,
and the third is no nation:
25 those who dwell in the mountain of Samaria, and the Philistines,
and the foolish people that dwelleth in Shechem.
26 Instruction of understanding and of knowledge
did Jesus, son of Sirach Eleazar, the Jerusalemite, engrave in this book,
who brought forth wisdom from his heart.
27 Blessed is he who shall be conversant in these things;
and he who layeth them upon his heart shall be made wise.
28 For if he do these things, he shall prevail in all,
because the light of the Lord is his path,
and unto the pious hath He given wisdom.
29 Blessed be the Lord forevermore. So be it, so be it.

**Chapter Fifty-One**

The Prayer of Jesus, Son of Sirach.

1 I will confess unto Thee, O Lord, O King,
and I will praise Thee, O God, my Savior;
I confess unto Thy Name.
2 For Thou hast been a protector and a helper unto me,
and hast delivered my body from destruction,
and from the snare of a slanderous tongue,
from the lips that work falsehood;
and before those who stood by, Thou wast my helper.
3 And Thou hast delivered me according to the multitude
of Thy mercy and Thy Name,
from the gnashing of teeth of those ready for their prey,
from the hand of those seeking my soul,
from the many tribulations which I had,
4 from the choking flame of the pyre all around,
and from the midst of a fire which I did not kindle,
5 from the depths of the belly of Hades,
and from an impure tongue and a false word.
6 Slander unto a king proceedeth from an unjust tongue.
My soul drew near unto death,
and my life was nigh unto Hades beneath.
7 They encompassed me on every side,
and there was none to help;
I looked for the succor of men, and there was none.
8 And I remembered Thy mercy, O Lord,
and Thy works which are from everlasting;
for Thou dost deliver those who patiently await Thee, and
