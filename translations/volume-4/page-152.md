Τοιγαροῦν ὁ τοῦ κόσμου κτίστης, ὁ πλάσας ἀνθρώπου γένεσιν 23
καὶ πάντων ἐξευρὼν γένεσιν, καὶ τὸ πνεῦμα καὶ τὴν ζωὴν ὑμῖν
πάλιν ἀποδώσει μετ᾿ ἐλέους, ὡς νῦν ὑπερορᾶτε ἑαυτοὺς διὰ τοὺς
αὐτοῦ νόμους. Ὁ δὲ Ἀντίοχος οἰόμενος καταφρονεῖσθαι καὶ τὴν 24
ἐνειδίζουσαν ὑφορώμενος φωνήν, ἔτι τοῦ νεωτέρου περιόντος, οὐ
μόνον διὰ λόγων ἔπεισετο τὴν παράκλησιν, ἀλλὰ καὶ δι᾿ ὅρκων
ἐπίστου, ἅμα πλουτίειν καὶ μακαριστὸν ποιήσειν (καὶ) μεταθέ-
μενον ἀπὸ τῶν πατρίων νόμων, καὶ φίλον ἕξειν, καὶ χρείας ἐμ-
πιστεύσειν. Τοῦ δὲ νεανίου μηδαμῶς προσέχοντος, προσκαλε- 25
σάμενος ὁ βασιλεὺς τὴν μητέρα παρήνει γενέσθαι τοῦ μειρα-
κίου σύμβουλον ἐπὶ σωτηρίᾳ. Ἀλλὰ δὲ αὐτοῦ παραινήσαντος, 26
ἐπεδέξατο πείσειν τὸν υἱόν. Προσκύψασα δὲ αὐτῷ, γλευσάσασα 27
τῷ ὠμῷ τύραννῳ, οὕτως ἔφησε τῇ πατρίῳ φωνῇ· υἱέ, ἐλέησόν
με τὴν ἐν γαστρὶ περιενέγκασάν σε μῆνας ἐννέα, καὶ θηλάσασάν
σε ἔτη τρία, καὶ ἐκθρέψασάν σε, καὶ ἀγαγοῦσαν εἰς τὴν ἡλικίαν
ταύτην, καὶ τροφοφορήσασαν. Ἀξιῶσε, τέκνον, ἀναβλέψαντα εἰς 28
τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ τὴν γῆν, καὶ τὰ ἐν αὐτοῖς πάντα ἰδόντα γνῶναι,
ὅτι ἐξ οὐκ ὄντων ἐποίησεν αὐτὰ ὁ Θεός, καὶ τὸ τῶν ἀνθρώπων
γένος οὕτω γεγένηται. Μὴ φοβηθῇς τὸν δήμιον τοῦτον, ἀλλὰ 29
τῶν ἀδελφῶν σου ἄξιος γενόμενος ἐπίδεξαι τὸν θάνατον, ἵνα ἐν
τῷ ἐλέει σὺν τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς σου κομίσωμαί σε. Ἔτι δὲ ταύτης 30
καταλεγούσης ὁ νεανίας εἶπε· τίνα μένεις; οὐχ ὑπακούω τοῦ
προστάγματος τοῦ βασιλέως· τοῦ δὲ προστάγματος ἀκούω τοῦ
νόμου τοῦ δοθέντος τοῖς πατράσιν ἡμῶν διὰ Μωυσέως. Σὺ δὲ 31
πάσης κακίας εὑρετὴς γενόμενος εἰς τοὺς Ἑβραίους οὐ μὴ διαφύ-
γῃς τὰς χεῖρας τοῦ Θεοῦ. Ἡμεῖς γὰρ διὰ τὰς ἑαυτῶν ἁμαρ- 32
τίας πάσχομεν. Εἰ δὲ χάριν ἐπιπλήξεως καὶ παιδείας ὁ ζῶν 33
Κύριος ἡμῶν βραχέως ἐπώργισται, καὶ πάλιν καταλλαγήσεται
τοῖς ἑαυτοῦ δούλοις. Σὺ δέ, ὦ ἀνόσιε καὶ πάντων ἀνθρώπων 34
μιαρώτατε, μὴ μάτην μετεωρίζου φρυαττόμενος ἀθλίοις ἐλπίσιν
ἐπὶ τοὺς οὐρανίους παῖδας ἐπαράμενος χεῖρα. Οὔπω γὰρ τὴν 35
τοῦ παντοκράτορος ἐπόπτου Θεοῦ κρίσιν ἐκπέφευγας. Οἱ μὲν 36
γὰρ νῦν ἡμέτεροι ἀδελφοὶ βραχὺν ὑπενέγκαντες πόνον ἀενάου ζωῆς
ὑπὸ διαθήκην Θεοῦ πεπτώκασι· σὺ δὲ τῇ τοῦ Θεοῦ κρίσει δι-

#### CHAPTER VII.

**23** Therefore, the Creator of the world, who fashioned man's generation and brought forth the origin of all things, shall also restore unto you again both spirit and life with mercy, inasmuch as ye now account your lives as naught for the sake of His laws.

**24** But Antiochus, deeming himself scorned, and suspecting the reproachful voice, while the youngest yet lived, sought to persuade him not only by words of entreaty, but also by oaths did he assure him, that he would both enrich him and make him blessed, should he turn from the laws of his fathers; yea, he would have him as a friend and entrust him with weighty matters.

**25** But the young man giving no heed whatsoever, the king called the mother unto him and exhorted her to become a counselor to the youth for his preservation. **26** But when he had thus exhorted her, she undertook to persuade her son.

**27** And having bowed herself unto him, mocking the cruel tyrant, thus spake she in the tongue of her fathers: "My son, pity me, who did bear thee in my womb for nine months, and didst nurse thee for three years, and did rear thee, and did bring thee unto this age, and didst nourish thee. **28** I beseech thee, my child, look thou up unto the heaven and the earth, and beholding all things that are therein, know thou that God made them of things that were not, and that the race of men came into being in this wise. **29** Fear not this executioner, but becoming worthy of thy brethren, accept thou death, that in [God's] mercy I may receive thee again with thy brethren."

**30** While she yet spake these things, the young man said, "What dost thou await? I obey not the commandment of the king; but I obey the commandment of the Law, which was given unto our fathers by Moses. **31** But thou, who hast become the inventor of all evil against the Hebrews, shalt in no wise escape the hands of God. **32** For we suffer these things for our own sins. **33** For if, for the sake of rebuke and chastisement, our living Lord hath been wroth for a little while, yet again shall He be reconciled unto His own servants. **34** But thou, O unholy one, and thou most defiled of all men, be not lifted up in vain, raging with wretched hopes, having lifted up thy hand against the children of Heaven. **35** For thou hast not yet escaped the judgment of the all-ruling God, who seeth all things. **36** For our brethren, having now endured a brief pain, have entered into the covenant of eternal life from God; but thou, by the judgment of God, shalt bear the righteous recompenses of thy pride.

**37** But I, even as my brethren, do yield up both my body and my soul for the sake of the laws of my fathers,
