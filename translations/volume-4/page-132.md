**ΚΕΦ. ΙΕ΄.**
**33** τῆς κληρονομίας ἡμῶν καὶ τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν.
**34** [Περὶ δὲ Ἰό]ππης καὶ Γαζάρων, ὧν αἰτεῖς, αὗται ἐποίουν ἐν τῷ λαῷ πληγὴν μεγάλην κατὰ τὴν χώραν ἡμῶν, τούτων δώσομεν τάλαντα ἑκατόν·
**35** καὶ οὐκ ἀπεκρίθη αὐτῷ Ἀθηνόβιος λόγον. Ἀπέστρεψε δὲ μετὰ θυμοῦ πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα, καὶ ἀπήγγειλεν αὐτῷ τοὺς λόγους τούτους καὶ τὴν δόξαν Σίμωνος καὶ πάντα ὅσα εἶδε, καὶ ὡργίσθη ὁ βασιλεὺς ὀργὴν μεγάλην.
**36** Τρύφων δὲ ἐμβὰς εἰς πλοῖον ἔφυγεν εἰς Ὀρθωσίαν.
**37** Καὶ κατέστησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τὸν Κενδεβαῖον ὑποστράτηγον τῆς παραλίας, καὶ δυνάμεις πεζικὰς καὶ ἱππικὰς ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ.
**38** Καὶ ἐνετείλατο αὐτῷ παρεμβάλλειν κατὰ πρόσωπον τῆς Ἰουδαίας· καὶ ἐνετείλατο αὐτῷ οἰκοδομῆσαι τὴν Κεδρὼν καὶ ὀχυρῶσαι τὰς πόλεις, καὶ ὅπως πολεμῇ τὸν λαόν· ὁ δὲ βασιλεὺς ἐδίωκε τὸν Τρύφωνα.
**39** Καὶ παρεγενήθη Κενδεβαῖος εἰς Ἰάμνειαν, καὶ ἤρξατο τοῦ ἐρεθίζειν τὸν λαὸν καὶ ἐμβατεύειν εἰς τὴν Ἰουδαίαν καὶ αἰχμαλωτίζειν τὸν λαὸν καὶ φονεύειν.
**40** Καὶ ᾠκοδόμησε τὴν Κεδρὼν καὶ ἔταξεν ἐκεῖ ἱππεῖς καὶ δυνάμεις ὅπως ἐκπορευόμενοι ἐξοδεύωσι τὰς ὁδοὺς τῆς Ἰουδαίας, καθὰ συνέταξεν αὐτῷ ὁ βασιλεύς.

**ΚΕΦ. ΙΕ΄. XVI.**

**1** ΚΑΙ ἀνέβη Ἰωάννης ἐκ Γαζάρων, καὶ ἀπήγγειλε Σίμωνι τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ ἃ συνετέλει Κενδεβαῖος.
**2** Καὶ ἐκάλεσε Σίμων τοὺς δύο υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους Ἰούδαν καὶ Ἰωάννην, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς·
**3** ἐγὼ καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοί μου καὶ ὁ οἶκος τοῦ πατρός μου ἐπολεμήσαμεν τοὺς πολέμους Ἰσραὴλ ἀπὸ νεότητος ἕως τῆς σήμερον ἡμέρας, καὶ εὐοδώθη ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν ἡμῶν ῥύσασθαι τὸν Ἰσραὴλ πλεονάκις.
**4** Νῦν δὲ γεγήρακα, καὶ ὑμεῖς δὲ ἐν τῷ ἐλέει ἱκανοί ἐστε ἐν τοῖς ἔτεσι· γίνεσθε ἀντ᾿ ἐμοῦ καὶ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ μου, καὶ ἐξελθόντες ὑπερμαχεῖτε ὑπὲρ τοῦ ἔθνους ἡμῶν, ἡ δὲ ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ βοήθεια ἤτω μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν.
**5** Καὶ ἐπέλεξεν ἐκ τῆς χώρας εἴκοσι χιλιάδας ἀνδρῶν πολεμιστῶν καὶ ἱππεῖς, καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν ἐπὶ τὸν Κενδεβαῖον, καὶ ἐκοιμήθησαν ἐν Μωδαείμ.
**6** Καὶ ἀναστάντες τοπρωῒ ἐπορεύοντο εἰς τὸ πεδίον, καὶ ἰδοὺ δύναμις πολλὴ εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτοῖς, πεζικοὶ καὶ ἱππεῖς, καὶ χειμάῤῥους ἦν ἀναμέσον αὐτῶν.
**7** Καὶ παρενέβαλε κατὰ πρόσωπον

**Chapter 15**

**33** ...the inheritance which is ours, and that of our fathers.

**34** But as for Joppa and Gazara, which thou demandest, these did work a great wound upon the people throughout our land; for these shall we give an hundred talents.

**35** And Athenobius answered him not a word. But he returned with indignation unto the king, and reported unto him these words and the glory of Simon, and all things whatsoever he had seen; and the king was wroth with a great wrath.

**37** And the king appointed Cendebaeus to be captain over the seacoast, and he gave unto him bands of footmen and of horsemen.

**38** And he commanded him to encamp against Judea; and he commanded him to build up Cedron and to fortify the cities, and that he should make war upon the people; for the king himself pursued Tryphon.

**39** And Cendebaeus came unto Jamnia, and he began to provoke the people and to make incursions into Judea, and to take the people captive, and to slay them.

**40** And he built up Cedron, and set there horsemen and forces, that going forth they might sally out upon the ways of Judea, as the king had commanded him.

**Chapter 16**

**1** Now John went up from Gazara, and reported unto Simon his father the things which Cendebaeus was doing.

**2** And Simon called his two elder sons, Judas and John, and said unto them:

**3** "I, and my brethren, and the house of my father, have fought the wars of Israel from our youth even unto this present day; and it hath prospered in our hands to deliver Israel oftentimes.

**4** Now therefore am I grown old, but ye also are of sufficient age by God's mercy. Be ye instead of me and my brother, and go forth and fight for our nation; and let the help that is from Heaven be with you."

**5** And he chose out of the country twenty thousand men of war with horsemen, and they went forth against Cendebaeus, and they rested in Modin.

**6** And rising up early in the morning, they went forth into the plain, and behold, a great army came to meet them, both footmen and horsemen; and there was a brook betwixt them.
