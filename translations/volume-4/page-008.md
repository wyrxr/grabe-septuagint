ΚΕΦ. Δ΄. IV.

Ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἐμνήσθη Τωβὶτ περὶ τοῦ ἀργυρίου, οὗ 1 παρέθετο Γαβαὴλ ἐν Ῥάγοις τῆς Μηδίας. Καὶ εἶπεν ἐν αὐτῷ· 2 ἐγὼ ᾐτησάμην θάνατον, τί οὐ καλῶ Τωβίαν τὸν υἱόν μου, ἵνα αὐτῷ ὑποδείξω πρὶν ἀποθανεῖν με; Καὶ καλέσας αὐτόν, εἶπε· 3 παιδίον, ἐὰν ἀποθάνω, θάψον με, καὶ μὴ ὑπερίδῃς τὴν μητέρα σου· τίμα αὐτὴν πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς ζωῆς σου, καὶ ποίει τὸ ἀρεστὸν αὐτῇ, καὶ μὴ λυπήσῃς αὐτήν. Μνησθήτι, παιδίον, ὅτι 4 πολλοὺς κινδύνους ἑώρακεν ἐπὶ σοὶ ἐν τῇ κοιλίᾳ. ὅταν ἀποθάνῃ, θάψον αὐτὴν παρ᾿ ἐμοὶ ἐν ἑνὶ τάφῳ. Πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας, παιδίον, 5 Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν μνημόνευε, καὶ μὴ θελήσῃς ἁμαρτάνειν καὶ παραβῆναι τὰς ἐντολὰς αὐτοῦ· καὶ δικαιοσύνην ποίει πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς ζωῆς σου, καὶ μὴ πορευθῇς ταῖς ὁδοῖς τῆς ἀδικίας. Διότι ποιοῦντός σου τὴν ἀλήθειαν, εὐοδίαι ἔσονται ἐν 6 τοῖς ἔργοις σου καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς ποιοῦσι τὴν δικαιοσύνην. Ἐκ τῶν 7 ὑπαρχόντων σου ποίει ἐλεημοσύνην, καὶ μὴ φθονεσάτω σου ὁ ὀφθαλμὸς ἐν τῷ ποιεῖν ἐλεημοσύνην· μὴ ἀποστρέψῃς τὸ πρόσωπόν σου ἀπὸ παντὸς πτωχοῦ, καὶ ἀπὸ σοῦ οὐ μὴ ἀποστραφῇ τὸ πρόσωπον τοῦ Θεοῦ. Ὡς σοι ὑπάρχει κατὰ τὸ πλῆθος, ποίησον 8 ἐξ αὐτῶν ἐλεημοσύνην. ἐὰν ὀλίγον σοι ὑπάρχῃ, κατὰ τὸ ὀλίγον μὴ φοβοῦ ποιεῖν ἐλεημοσύνην. Θέμα γὰρ ἀγαθὸν θησαυρίζεις σεαυτῷ 9 εἰς ἡμέραν ἀνάγκης. Διότι ἐλεημοσύνη ἐκ θανάτου ρύεται, 10 καὶ οὐκ ἐᾷ εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὸ σκότος. Δῶρον ἀγαθὸν ἔστιν ἐλεημοσύνη 11 πᾶσι τοῖς ποιοῦσιν αὐτὴν ἐνώπιον τοῦ ὑψίστου. Πρόσεχε 12 σεαυτῷ, παιδίον, ἀπὸ πάσης πορνείας, καὶ γυναῖκα πρῶτον λαβὲ ἀπὸ τοῦ σπέρματος τῶν πατέρων σου· καὶ μὴ λάβῃς γυναῖκα ἀλλοτρίαν, ἣ οὐκ ἔστιν ἐκ τῆς φυλῆς τοῦ πατέρος σου, διότι υἱοὶ προφητῶν ἐσμέν. Νῶε, Ἀβραάμ, καὶ Ἰσαάκ, καὶ Ἰακώβ, οἱ

[Tobit 3:16 continued]
...of the great Raphael. And he was sent to heal them both: to remove the white films from Tobit’s eyes, and to give Sarah, the daughter of Raguel, unto Tobias, the son of Tobit, to be his wife; and to bind Asmodeus, the evil demon, for unto Tobias it falleth to inherit her. In that same season, didst thou return, O Tobit, and enteredst into thine own house; and Sarah, the daughter of Raguel, came down from her upper chamber.

**Chapter 4**

[Tobit 4:1]
On that same day, Tobit did call to remembrance the silver which Gabael had deposited in Rages of Media.

[Tobit 4:2]
And he said within himself, "I have indeed sought death. Wherefore then do I not call Tobias my son, that I may instruct him ere I die?"

[Tobit 4:3]
And when he had called him, he said, "My child, if I die, then bury me, and neglect not thy mother; honor her all the days of thy life, and do that which is pleasing unto her, and grieve her not."

[Tobit 4:4]
"Remember, my child, that she hath seen many perils on thy behalf in the womb. When she dieth, bury her beside me in one grave."

[Tobit 4:5]
"All thy days, my child, be mindful of the Lord our God, and desire not to sin nor to transgress His commandments; but do righteousness all the days of thy life, and walk not in the ways of unrighteousness."

[Tobit 4:6]
"For if thou doest truth, prosperities shall be in thy works and in [the works of] all them that do righteousness."

[Tobit 4:7]
"From thy possessions, give alms, and let not thine eye be envious when thou doest alms; turn not thy countenance from any poor man, and the countenance of God shall not be turned from thee."

[Tobit 4:8]
"As thou hast according to thy abundance, make alms therefrom. If thou hast but little, fear not to give alms according to that little."

[Tobit 4:9]
"For thou layest up a good store for thyself against the day of need."

[Tobit 4:10]
"For almsgiving doth deliver from death, and suffereth not [one] to enter into darkness."

[Tobit 4:11]
"Almsgiving is a goodly gift unto all them that do it before the Most High."

[Tobit 4:12]
"Take heed to thyself, my child, from all fornication; and first take a wife from the seed of thy fathers. And take not a strange woman, who is not of the tribe of thy father, for we are sons of prophets: Noah, Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, our fathers from ages past..."
