ΚΕΦ. Β΄. ΟΙΕΡΕΥΣ 1585
Κύρου βασιλέως Περσῶν, καὶ ἐκήρυξεν ἐν ὅλῃ τῇ βασιλείᾳ ἑαυ-
τοῦ, καὶ ἅμα δὲ γραπτῶν, λέγων· τάδε λέγει ὁ βασιλεὺς Περ- 3
σῶν Κῦρος· ἐμὲ ἀνέδειξε βασιλέα τῆς οἰκουμένης ὁ Κύριος τοῦ
Ἰσραήλ, Κύριος ὁ ὕψιστος. Καὶ ἐσήμηνέ μοι οἰκοδομῆσαι ἑαυ- 4
τῷ οἶκον ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, τῇ ἐν τῇ Ἰουδαίᾳ. Εἴτις ἐστὶν οὖν ὑ- 5
μῶν ἐκ τοῦ ἔθνους αὐτοῦ, ἔστω ὁ Κύριος Κύριος αὐτοῦ μετ’
αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀναβὰς εἰς τὴν Ἱερουσαλήμ τὴν ἐν τῇ Ἰουδαίᾳ, οἰ-
κοδομείτω τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου τοῦ Ἰσραήλ· οὗτος ὁ Κύριος, ὁ κα-
τασκηνώσας ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ. Ὅσοι οὖν κατὰ τόπους οἰκοῦσι, βο- 6
ηθείτωσαν αὐτῷ οἱ ἐν τῷ τόπῳ αὐτοῦ, ἐν χρυσίῳ καὶ ἐν ἀργυρίῳ,
ἐν δόσεσι μεθ᾽ ἵππων καὶ κτηνῶν σὺν τοῖς ἄλλοις τοῖς κατ᾽ εὐχὰς
προστεθειμένοις εἰς τὸ ἱερὸν τοῦ Κυρίου τὸ ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ 7
καταστάντες οἱ ἀρχίφυλοι τῶν πατριῶν τῆς Ἰούδα καὶ Βενιαμὶν
φυλῆς, καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς καὶ οἱ Λευῖται, καὶ πάντων ὧν ἤγειρε Κύ-
ριος τὸ πνεῦμα, ἀναβῆναι οἰκοδομῆσαι οἶκον τῷ Κυρίῳ τὸν ἐν
Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ οἱ περὶ κύκλῳ αὐτῶν ἐβοήθησαν ἐν πᾶ- 8
σιν, ἐν ἀργυρίῳ καὶ χρυσίῳ, ἵπποις καὶ κτήνεσι, καὶ εὐχαῖς ὦ-
στε πλείσταις πολλῶν, ὧν ὁ νοῦς ἠγέρθη. Καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς Κῦρος 9
ἐξήνεγκε τὰ ἱερὰ σκεύη τοῦ Κυρίου, ἃ μετήνεγκε Ναβουχοδονό-
σορ ἐξ Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἀπηρείσατο αὐτὰ ἐν τῷ ἑαυτοῦ εἰδω-
λείῳ. Ἐξήνεγκεν δὲ αὐτὰ Κῦρος ὁ βασιλεὺς Περσῶν παρέδω- 10
κεν αὐτὰ Μιθριδάτῃ τῷ ἑαυτοῦ γαζοφύλακι· διὰ δὲ τούτου πα- 11
ρεδόθησαν Σασαβασσάρῳ τῷ προστάτῃ τῆς Ἰουδαίας. Ὁ δὲ τού- 12
των ἀριθμὸς ἦν, σπονδεῖα χρυσᾶ χίλια, καὶ σπονδεῖα ἀργυρᾶ
χίλια, θυΐσκαι ἀργυραῖ εἰκοσιεννέα, φιάλαι χρύσεαι τριάκοντα,
ἀργυραῖ δισχίλιαι τετρακόσιαι δέκα, καὶ ἄλλα σκεύη χίλια. Τὰ 13
δὲ πάντα σκεύη διεκομίσθη χρυσᾶ καὶ ἀργυρᾶ πεντακισχίλια τε-
τρακόσια ἑξηκονταεννέα· ἀνηνέχθη δὲ ὑπὸ Σασαβασσάρου ἅμα τοῖς 14
ἐκ τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας ἐκ Βαβυλῶνος εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα. Ἐν δὲ τοῖς ἐπὶ 15
Ἀρταξέρξου τοῦ Περσῶν βασιλέως χρόνοις κατέγραψεν αὐτῷ κατὰ
τῶν κατοικούντων ἐν τῇ Ἰουδαίᾳ καὶ Ἱερουσαλὴμ Βήλεμος, καὶ
Μιθριδάτης, καὶ Ταβέλλιος, καὶ Ῥάθύμος, καὶ Βεέλτεθμος, καὶ
Σεμέλλιος ὁ γραμματεὺς, καὶ οἱ λοιποὶ οἱ τούτοις συντασσόμε-
νοι, οἱ οἰκοῦντες δὲ ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις τόποις, τὴν ὑ-
πογεγραμμένην ἐπιστολήν. Βασιλεῖ Ἀρταξέρξῃ κυρίῳ οἱ παῖδες 16
σου, Ῥάθύμος ὁ τὰ προσπίπτοντα, καὶ Σεμέλλιος ὁ γραμματεύς,

**Chapter II.**

**2** of Cyrus, king of Persia; and he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and also by means of writings, saying:
**3** "Thus saith Cyrus, the king of Persia: The Lord of Israel, even the Lord Most High, hath appointed me king over all the inhabited earth.
**4** And He hath signified unto me that I should build Him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judea.
**5** Whosoever therefore among you is of His nation, let the Lord, his Lord, be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judea, and build the house of the Lord of Israel; for this is the Lord, Who hath dwelt in Jerusalem.
**6** Therefore, as many as dwell in [their respective] places, let those that are in his place assist him with gold and with silver, with gifts, and with horses and with cattle, together with the other things dedicated according to vows unto the temple of the Lord which is in Jerusalem."
**7** Then rose up the chief of the fathers of the tribe of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests and the Levites, with all those whose spirit the Lord had stirred up, to go up and to build a house for the Lord in Jerusalem.
**8** And those round about them did help them in all things, with silver and with gold, with horses and with cattle, and with vows, even with very many of many, whose minds were stirred up.
**9** And King Cyrus brought forth the holy vessels of the Lord, which Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from Jerusalem, and had laid them up in his own idol-temple.
**10** And when Cyrus, the king of Persia, had brought them forth, he delivered them unto Mithridates, his treasurer.
**11** And by his hand were they delivered unto Sasabassarus, the governor of Judea.
**12** Now the number of these was: one thousand golden libation bowls, and one thousand silver libation bowls, twenty and nine silver thuribles, thirty golden bowls, two thousand four hundred and ten silver bowls, and one thousand other vessels.
**13** And all the vessels, both of gold and of silver, that were brought over, were five thousand four hundred sixty and nine.
**14** And they were brought up by Sasabassarus, together with those who came up out of the captivity from Babylon to Jerusalem.
**15** Now in the times of Artaxerxes, the king of the Persians, Belemus, and Mithridates, and Tabellius, and Rathymus, and Beeltethmus, and Semellius the scribe, and the rest who were associated with them, and who dwelt in Samaria and in the other places, did write unto him the letter here below written, against those who dwelt in Judea and in Jerusalem.
