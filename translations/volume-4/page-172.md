  Ὁ δὲ Νικάνωρ μεταλαβὼν τοὺς περὶ τὸν Ἰούδαν ὄντας ἐν 1
τοῖς κατὰ Σαμαρείαν τόποις, ἐβουλεύσατο τῇ τῆς καταπαύσεως
ἡμέρᾳ μετὰ πάσης ἀσφαλείας αὐτοῖς ἐπιβαλεῖν. Τῶν δὲ κατὰ 2
ἀνάγκην συνεπομένων αὐτῷ Ἰουδαίων λεγόντων, μηδαμῶς οὕτως
ἀγρίως καὶ βαρβάρως ἀπολέσῃς, δόξαν δὲ ἀπομερίσῃ τῇ προτε-
τιμημένῃ ὑπὸ τοῦ πάντα ἐφορῶντος μεθ᾽ ἁγιότητος ἡμέρᾳ. Ὁ 3
δὲ τρισαλιτήριος ἐπρωτήσεν, εἰ ἔστιν ἐν οὐρανῷ ὁ δυνάστης ὁ
προστεταχὼς ἄγειν τὴν τῶν σαββάτων ἡμέραν. Τῶν δ᾽ ἀποφη- 4
ναμένων, ἔστιν ὁ Κύριος ζῶν αὐτὸς ἐν οὐρανῷ δυνάστης ὁ κε-
λεύσας ἀσκεῖν τὴν ἑβδομάδα. Ὁ δ᾽ ἕτερος, κἀγὼ φησί, δυνάστης 5
ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, ὁ προστάσσων αἴρειν τὰ ὅπλα καὶ τὰς βασιλικὰς
χρείας ἐπιτελεῖν, ὅμως οὐ κατέσχεν ἐπιτελέσαι τὸ σχέτλιον αὐ-
τοῦ βούλημα. Καὶ ὁ μὲν Νικάνωρ μετὰ πάσης ἀλαζονείας ὑψαυ- 6
χενῶν, διεγνώκει κοινὸν τῶν περὶ τὸν Ἰούδαν συστήσασθαι τρό-
παιον. Ὁ δὲ Μακκαβαῖος ἦν ἀδιαλείπτως πεποιθὼς μετὰ πάσης 7
ἐλπίδος ἀντιλήψεως τεύξασθαι παρὰ τοῦ Κυρίου. Καὶ παρεκά- 8
λει τοὺς σὺν αὐτῷ μὴ δειλιᾶν τὴν τῶν ἐθνῶν ἔφοδον, ἔχοντας
δὲ κατὰ νοῦν τὰ προγεγονότα αὐτοῖς ἀπ᾽ οὐρανοῦ βοηθήματα,
καὶ τανῦν προσδοκᾶν τὴν παρὰ τοῦ παντοκράτορος ἐσομένην αὐ-
τοῖς νίκην καὶ βοήθειαν. Καὶ παραμυθούμενος αὐτοὺς ἐκ τοῦ 9
νόμου καὶ τῶν προφητῶν, προσομνησάμενος δὲ αὐτοὺς καὶ τοὺς
ἀγῶνας, οὓς ἦσαν ἐκτετελεκότες, προθυμοτέρους αὐτοὺς κατέ-
στησε. Καὶ τοῖς θυμοῖς διεγείρας αὐτοὺς, παρήγγειλεν ἅμα 10
παρεπιδεικνὺς τὴν τῶν ἐθνῶν ἀθεσίαν καὶ τὴν τῶν ὅρκων παρά-
βασιν. Ἕκαστον δὲ αὐτῶν καθοπλίσας οὐ τὴν ἀσπίδων καὶ λογ- 11
χῶν ἀσφάλειαν, ὡς τὴν ἐν τοῖς ἀγαθοῖς λόγοις παράκλησιν, καὶ
προσεξηγάμενος ὄνειρον ἀξιόπιστον ὕπαρ τι πάντας ηὔφρανεν.
Ἦν δὲ ἡ τούτου θεωρία τοιάδε: Ὀνίαν τὸν γενόμενον ἀρχιερέα 12
ἄνδρα καλὸν καὶ ἀγαθόν, αἰδήμονα μὲν τὴν ἀπάντησιν, πρᾶον δὲ
τὸν τρόπον, καὶ λαλιὰν προέμενον πρεπόντως, καὶ ἐκ παι-
δὸς ἐκμεμελετηκότα πάντα τὰ τῆς ἀρετῆς ἴδια, τοῦτον τὰς χεῖ-
ρας προτείναντα κατεύχεσθαι τῷ παντὶ τῶν Ἰουδαίων συστήματι.
Εἶθ᾽ οὕτως ἐπιφανεῖν ἄνδρα πολιᾷ καὶ δόξῃ διαφέροντα, 13
Θαυμαστὴν δὲ τινὰ καὶ μεγαλοπρεπεστάτην εἶναι τὴν περὶ αὐτὸν ὑπεροχήν.

**Chapter 15**

**1** Now Nicanor, having learned that those who were with Judas were in the regions of Samaria, did counsel to fall upon them on the day of rest with all safety.
**2** But the Jews, who by necessity followed him, did say, “By no means do thou so savagely and barbarously destroy [them], but rather apportion glory unto the day honored by Him Who beholdeth all things with holiness.”
**3** But the thrice-wicked man did ask, “Is there in heaven a Mighty One Who hath commanded to keep the Sabbath day?”
**4** And when they had declared, “There is a living Lord Himself, a Mighty One in heaven, Who hath commanded to observe the seventh day,”
**5** then the other did say, “And I also am a mighty one upon the earth, who command to take up arms and to perform the king’s errands.” Yet he did not restrain himself from fulfilling his abominable intent.
**6** And Nicanor, with all arrogance, lifting up his neck, had purposed to set up a common trophy for those about Judas.
**7** But Maccabeus was ceaselessly confident, with all hope, that he should receive help from the Lord.
**8** And he exhorted those who were with him not to fear the assault of the Gentiles, but rather to bear in mind the succours that had aforetime come unto them from heaven, and even now to expect the victory and help which should come unto them from the Almighty.
**9** And comforting them from the Law and the Prophets, and moreover calling to their remembrance the battles which they had fought, he made them more zealous.
**10** And having stirred them up with courage, he commanded [them], at the same time displaying the godlessness of the Gentiles and their transgression of oaths.
**11** And having armed each one of them, not with the safety of shields and spears, but with the exhortation found in good words, and having recounted a trustworthy dream, [which was] a [veritable] reality, he gladdened all.
**12** Now the vision thereof was such: Onias, who had been high priest, a man good and noble, modest in his address, and gentle in his manner, and one who spoke becomingly, and from childhood had diligently practiced all the peculiar excellences of virtue, him did he see stretching forth his hands and praying for the whole assembly of the Jews.
**13** Then in like manner did appear a man excelling in hoariness and glory, and with wondrous and exceedingly magnificent preeminence about him.
