**ΜΑΚΚΑΒΑΙΩΝ Α΄. ΚΕΦ. ΙΑ΄.**
29 τὴν Σαμαρεῖτιν, καὶ ἐπηγγείλατο αὐτῷ τάλαντα τριακόσια. Καὶ
30 εὐδόκησεν ὁ βασιλεύς, καὶ ἔγραψε τῷ Ἰωνάθαν ἐπιστολὰς περὶ
31 πάντων τούτων ἐχούσας τὸν τρόπον τοῦτον. Βασιλεὺς Δημήτριος
32 Ἰωνάθαν τῷ ἀδελφῷ χαίρειν, καὶ ἔθνει Ἰουδαίων. Τὸ ἀντίγραφον
τῆς ἐπιστολῆς, ἧς ἐγράψαμεν Δασθένει τῷ συγγενεῖ ἡμῶν περὶ ὑμῶν,
33 γεγράφαμεν καὶ πρὸς ὑμᾶς, ὅπως εἰδῆτε. Βασιλεὺς Δημήτριος
34 Δασθένει τῷ πατρὶ χαίρειν. Τῷ ἔθνει τῶν Ἰουδαίων φίλοις ἡμῶν
καὶ συντηροῦσι τὰ πρὸς ἡμᾶς δίκαια ἐκρίναμεν ἀγαθοποιῆσαι, χάριν
τῆς ἐξ αὐτῶν εὐνοίας πρὸς ἡμᾶς.
35 Ἐστάκαμεν οὖν αὐτοῖς τὰ ὅρια τῆς Ἰουδαίας καὶ τοὺς τρεῖς νομοὺς
Ἀφαίρεμα, καὶ Λύδδα, καὶ Ῥαδαμεΐν, αἵτινες προσετέθησαν τῇ
Ἰουδαίᾳ ἀπὸ τῆς Σαμαρείτιδος, καὶ πάντα τὰ συγκυροῦντα αὐτοῖς
πᾶσι τοῖς θυσιάζουσιν εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα, ἀντὶ τῶν βασιλικῶν, ὧν
ἐλάμβανεν ὁ βασιλεὺς παρ᾿ αὐτῶν τὸ πρότερον κατ᾿ ἐνιαυτὸν ἀπὸ
τῶν γεννημάτων τῆς γῆς καὶ τῶν ἀκροδρύων.
36 Καὶ τὰ ἄλλα τὰ ἀνήκοντα ἡμῖν ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν τῶν δεκατῶν καὶ τῶν
τελῶν τῶν ἀνηκόντων ἡμῖν, καὶ τὰς τοῦ ἁλὸς λίμνας, καὶ τοὺς
ἀνήκοντας ἡμῖν στεφάνους, πάντα ἐπαρκῶς παρίεμεν αὐτοῖς.
37 Καὶ οὐκ ἀθετηθήσεται οὐδὲν τούτων ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν
ἅπαντα χρόνον.
38 Νῦν οὖν ἐπιμελεῖσθε τοῦ ποιῆσαι τούτων ἀντίγραφον, καὶ δοθήτω
Ἰωνάθαν, καὶ τεθήτω ἐν ὄρει τῷ ἁγίῳ ἐν τόπῳ ἐπιτηδείῳ ἐπισήμῳ.
39 Καὶ ἴδε Δημήτριος ὁ βασιλεύς, ὅτι ἡσύχασεν ἡ γῆ ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ,
καὶ οὐδὲν αὐτῷ ἀνθειστήκει, καὶ ἀπέλυσε πάσας τὰς δυνάμεις αὐτοῦ

**11:29** and the Samaria region. And he vowed unto him three hundred talents.
**11:30** And it pleased the king, and he did write unto Jonathan epistles concerning
**11:31** all these matters, having this tenor: King Demetrius
**11:32** unto Jonathan his brother, and unto the nation of the Jews, sendeth greeting. The transcript
of the epistle, which we did write unto Dasthenes our kinsman concerning you,
**11:33** we have likewise written unto you, that ye may know [it]. King Demetrius
**11:34** unto Dasthenes our father, sendeth greeting. Unto the nation of the Jews, our friends, who do uphold our just [rights],
we have determined to do them good, for the sake of their goodwill toward us.
**11:35** We have therefore established unto them the borders of Judea, and the three districts,
even Aphairema, and Lydda, and Radamein, which were added unto
Judea from the region of Samaria, and all things concurrent therewith, [granted] unto
all those who do sacrifice in Jerusalem, in lieu of the royal [revenues], which
the king did receive of them aforetime, year by year, from
the produce of the land and of the tree-fruits.
**11:36** And the other things belonging unto us from henceforth, of the tithes and of the
tolls belonging unto us, and the salt-lakes, and the
[royal] crowns belonging unto us—all these we sufficiently concede unto them.
**11:37** And nothing of these things shall be abrogated from henceforth and for
all time to come.
**11:38** Now therefore, take ye care to make a transcript of these [decrees], and let it be given
unto Jonathan, and let it be set upon the holy mountain in a suitable and conspicuous place.
**11:39** Now when King Demetrius did perceive that the land was at rest before him,
and that naught did withstand him, then he did dismiss all his forces.
