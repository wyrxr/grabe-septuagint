ΚΕΦ. Β΄. Γ΄. ΙΗΣΟΥ ΥΙΟΥ ΣΙΡΑΧ 1791
Κύριον ζητήσουσιν εὐδοκίαν αὐτοῦ, καὶ οἱ ἀγαπῶντες αὐτὸν ἐμπλη-
σθήσονται τοῦ νόμου. Οἱ φοβούμενοι Κύριον ἑτοιμάσουσι καρδίας 17
αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ ταπεινώσουσι τὰς ψυχὰς αὐτῶν, λέ- 18
γοντες· ἐμπεσούμεθα εἰς χεῖρας Κυρίου, καὶ οὐκ εἰς χεῖρας ἀν-
θρώπων· ὡς γὰρ ἡ μεγαλωσύνη αὐτοῦ, οὕτως καὶ τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. Γ΄. III.

ΕΜΟΥ τοῦ πατρὸς ἀκούσατε τέκνα, καὶ οὕτως ποιήσατε, ἵνα 1
σωθῆτε· ὁ γὰρ Κύριος ἐδόξασε πατέρα ἐπὶ τέκνοις, καὶ κρίσιν 2
μητρὸς ἐστερέωσεν ἐφ᾽ υἱοῖς. Ὁ τιμῶν πατέρα, ἐξιλάσκεται ἁμαρ- 3
τίας· καὶ ὡς ἀποθησαυρίζων, ὁ δοξάζων μητέρα αὐτοῦ. Ὁ τι- 4. 5
μῶν πατέρα εὐφρανθήσεται ὑπὸ τέκνων, καὶ ἐν ἡμέρᾳ προσευχῆς
αὐτοῦ εἰσακουσθήσεται. Ὁ δοξάζων πατέρα μακροημερεύσει, καὶ 6
ὁ εἰσακούων Κυρίου ἀναπαύσει μητέρα αὐτοῦ. Ὁ φοβούμενος τὸν 7
Κύριον τιμήσει πατέρα, καὶ ὡς δεσπόταις δουλεύσει (ἐν) τοῖς γεννή-
σασιν αὐτόν. Ἐν ἔργῳ καὶ λόγῳ τίμα τὸν πατέρα σου καὶ τὴν 8
μητέρα, ἵνα ἐπέλθῃ σοι εὐλογία παρ᾽ αὐτῶν. Εὐλογία γὰρ πατρὸς 9
στηρίζει οἴκους τέκνων, κατάρα δὲ μητρὸς ἐκριζοῖ θεμέλια. Μὴ 10
δοξάζου ἐν ἀτιμίᾳ πατρός σου, οὐ γάρ ἐστι σοι δόξα πατρὸς ἀτι-
μία· ἡ γὰρ δόξα ἀνθρώπου ἐκ τιμῆς πατρὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὄνειδος 11
τέκνοις μήτηρ ἐν ἀδοξίᾳ. Τέκνον, ἀντιλαβοῦ ἐν γήρᾳ πατρός σου, 12
καὶ μὴ λυπήσῃς αὐτὸν ἐν τῇ ζωῇ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐὰν ἀπολείπῃ σύνεσιν, 13
συγγνώμην ἔχε, καὶ μὴ ἀτιμάσῃς αὐτὸν ἐν πάσῃ ἰσχύϊ σου. Ἐλεη- 14
μοσύνη γὰρ πατρὸς οὐκ ἐπιλησθήσεται, καὶ ἀντὶ ἁμαρτιῶν προσ-
ανοικοδομηθήσεταί σοι· ἐν ἡμέρᾳ θλίψεώς σου ἀναμνησθήσεταί 15
σου ὡς εὐδία ἐπὶ παγετῷ, οὕτως ἀναλυθήσονταί σου αἱ ἁμαρτίαι.
Ὡς βλάσφημος ὁ ἐγκαταλιπὼν πατέρα, καὶ κεκατηραμένος παρὰ 16
Κυρίου ὁ παροργίζων μητέρα αὐτοῦ. Τέκνον, τὰ ἔργα σου ἐν 17
πραΰτητι διέξαγε, καὶ ὑπὸ ἀνθρώπου δεκτοῦ ἀγαπηθήσῃ. Ὅσῳ 18
μέγας εἶ, τοσούτῳ ταπεινοῦ σεαυτόν, καὶ ἔναντι Κυρίου εὑρήσεις
χάριν. Πολλοί εἰσιν ὑψηλοὶ καὶ ἐπίδοξοι· ἀλλὰ πραέσιν ἀποκα- 19
λύπτεται μυστήρια. Ὅτι μεγάλη ἡ δυναστεία Κυρίου, καὶ ὑπὸ 20
τῶν ταπεινῶν δοξάζεται. Χαλεπωτέρα σου μὴ ζήτει, καὶ ἰσχυ- 21
ρότερα σου μὴ ἐξέταζε· ἃ προσετάγη σοι, ταῦτα διανοοῦ ὁσίως· 22
οὐ γάρ ἐστι σοι χρεία τῶν κρυπτῶν βλέπειν ὀφθαλμοῖς. Ἐν τοῖς 23

**The Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach**

**Chapter Two**

16 [They that fear] the Lord shall seek His good pleasure, and they that love Him shall be filled with the Law.
17 They that fear the Lord shall prepare their hearts, and before Him shall humble their souls,
18 Saying: We will fall into the hands of the Lord, and not into the hands of men; for as is His majesty, so also is His mercy.

**Chapter Three**

1 Hearken unto me, your father, O my children, and do thus, that ye may be saved;
2 For the Lord hath glorified the father upon the children, and hath established the authority of the mother upon the sons.
3 He that honoureth his father, maketh atonement for sins;
4 And as one that layeth up treasure, so is he that glorifieth his mother.
5 He that honoureth his father shall have joy of his children, and in the day of his prayer shall be heard.
6 He that glorifieth his father shall have length of days, and he that hearkeneth unto the Lord shall bring rest to his mother.
7 He that feareth the Lord shall honour his father, and as [unto] masters shall he serve [even in] those that begat him.
8 In deed and in word honour thy father and thy mother, that a blessing may come unto thee from them.
9 For the blessing of a father establisheth the houses of his children, but the curse of a mother plucketh up foundations.
10 Boast not in the dishonour of thy father, for it is no glory unto thee when thy father is dishonoured;
11 For the glory of a man is from the honour of his father, and a reproach unto children is a mother in dishonour.
12 My son, help thy father in his old age, and grieve him not in his lifetime.
13 And though his understanding fail, have compassion, and dishonour him not in all thy strength.
14 For the compassion shown to a father shall not be forgotten, and for [the remission of] sins shall it be built up for thee;
15 In the day of thy tribulation, it shall be remembered for thee as clear weather upon a frost; so shall thy sins melt away.
16 As a blasphemer is he that forsaketh his father, and cursed of the Lord is he that provoketh his mother to wrath.
17 My son, conduct thy works with meekness, and thou shalt be beloved of an acceptable man.
18 The greater thou art, the more humble thyself, and before the Lord shalt thou find grace.
19 Many are high and renowned; but unto the meek are mysteries revealed.
20 For great is the power of the Lord, and by the humble is He glorified.
21 Seek not things too difficult for thee, nor search out things too mighty for thee;
22 Whatsoever hath been commanded thee, think upon these things reverently;
23 For thou hast no need to see with thine eyes the things that are hidden.
