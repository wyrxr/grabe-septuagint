27 θερισμοῦ· ὁ ἐκφαίνων ὡς φῶς παιδείαν γνώσεως, καὶ ὡς Γῆν ἐν
28 ἡμέραις τρυγητοῦ. Οὐ συνετέλεσεν ὁ πρῶτος γνῶναι αὐτήν, καὶ
29 οὕτως ὁ ἔσχατος οὐκ ἐξιχνίασεν αὐτήν· ἀπὸ γὰρ θαλάσσης ἐπλη-
30 θύνθη διανοήματα αὐτῆς, καὶ ἡ βουλὴ αὐτῆς ἀπὸ ἀβύσσου μεγά-
31 λης. Κἀγὼ ὡς διῶρυξ ἀπὸ ποταμοῦ, καὶ ὡς ὑδραγωγὸς ἐξῆλθον
32 εἰς παράδεισον. Εἶπα· ποτίσω μου τὸν κῆπον τὸν ἄριστον, καὶ
33 μεθύσω μου τὴν πρασιάν· καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐγένετό μου ἡ διῶρυξ εἰς πο-
34 ταμόν, καὶ ὁ ποταμός μου ἐγένετο εἰς θάλασσαν. Ἔτι παιδείαν ὡς
35 ὄρθρον φωτιῶ, καὶ ἐκφανῶ αὐτὴν ἕως εἰς μακράν· ἔτι διδασκα-
36 λίαν ὡς προφητείαν ἐκχεῶ, καὶ καταλείψω αὐτὴν εἰς γενεὰς αἰώ-
37 νων. Ἴδετε ὅτι οὐκ ἐμοὶ μόνῳ ἐκοπίασα, ἀλλὰ πᾶσι τοῖς ἐκζη-
38 τοῦσιν αὐτήν.

1 **ἘΝ** τρισὶν ὡραΐσθην καὶ ἀνέστην ὡραία ἔναντι Κυρίου καὶ
2 ἀνθρώπων· ὁμόνοια ἀδελφῶν, καὶ φιλία τῶν πλησίον, καὶ γυνὴ καὶ
3 ἀνὴρ ἑαυτοῖς συμπεριφερόμενοι. Τρία δὲ εἴδη ἐμίσησεν ἡ ψυχή
4 μου, καὶ προσώχθισα σφόδρα τῇ ζωῇ αὐτῶν· πτωχὸν ὑπερήφα-
5 νον, καὶ πλούσιον ψεύστην, καὶ γέροντα μοιχὸν ἐλαττούμενον συνέσει.
6 Ἂ ἐν νεότητί σου οὐ συναγήγρχας, καὶ πῶς ἂν εὕροις ἐν τῷ
7 γήρᾳ σου; Ὡς ὡραῖον πολιὰς κρίσις, καὶ πρεσβυτέροις ἐπιγνῶ-
8 ναι βουλήν· Ὡς ὡραία γερόντων σοφία, καὶ δεδοξασμένοις διανόη-
9 μα καὶ βουλή· στέφανος γερόντων πολυπειρία, καὶ τὸ καύχημα
10 αὐτῶν φόβος Κυρίου. Ἐννέα ὑπονοήματα ἐμακάρισα ἐν τῇ καρ-
11 δίᾳ μου, καὶ τὸ δέκατον ἐρῶ ἐπὶ γλώσσῃς μου· ἄνθρωπος εὐφραι-
12 νόμενος ἐπὶ τέκνοις, ζῶν καὶ βλέπων ἐπὶ πτώσει ἐχθρῶν· μακά-
13 ριος ὁ συνοικῶν γυναικὶ συνετῇ, καὶ ὃς ἐν γλώσσῃ οὐκ ὠλίσθησε, καὶ
14 ὃς οὐκ ἐδούλευσεν ἀναξίῳ ἑαυτοῦ· μακάριος ὃς εὗρε φρόνησιν,
15 καὶ ὁ διηγούμενος εἰς ὦτα ἀκουόντων· ὡς μέγας ὁ εὑρὼν σοφίαν,
16 ἀλλ᾿ οὐκ ἔστιν ὑπὲρ τὸν φοβούμενον τὸν **Κύριον**· ἀγάπησις Κυ-
17 ρίου ὑπὲρ πᾶν ὑπερέβαλεν εἰς φωτισμόν, ὁ κρατῶν αὐτῆς τίνι ὁ-
18 μοιωθήσεται; Φόβος Κυρίου ἀρχὴ ἀγαπήσεως αὐτοῦ· πίστις δὲ
19 ἀρχὴ κολλήσεως αὐτοῦ. Πᾶσαν πληγήν, καὶ μὴ πληγὴν καρ-
20 δίας· καὶ πᾶσαν πονηρίαν, καὶ μὴ πονηρίαν γυναικός· καὶ πᾶσαν
21 ἐπαγωγήν, καὶ μὴ ἐπαγωγήν μισούντων· καὶ πᾶσαν ἐκδίκησιν, καὶ

**Chapter Twenty-Four**
27 of harvest. He that manifesteth, as light, the discipline of knowledge,
and as the Earth in the days of vintage.
28 The first man could not fully know her,
29 neither shall the last trace her out. For her thoughts were multiplied from the sea,
30 and her counsel from a great abyss.
31 And I, as a canal from a river, and as an aqueduct, came forth into [the] Paradise.
32 I said, "I shall water my most excellent garden,
33 and make drunken my flowerbed." And behold, my canal became a river,
34 and my river became a sea.
Yet further, instruction as the dawn shall I enlighten, and reveal her even unto afar;
35 yet further, instruction as prophecy shall I pour forth,
36 and I shall leave her to generations of ages.
37 Behold, for not for myself alone have I labored,
but for all them that seek her out.

**Chapter Twenty-Five**
1 **In** three things was I made beautiful, and I stood up beautiful before the Lord and men:
2 The harmony of brethren, and the friendship of neighbors,
and a wife and a husband conducting themselves well with one another.
3 But three kinds of things did my soul hate,
4 and I was exceedingly disgusted with their life:
A proud poor man, and a rich liar,
5 and an old man, an adulterer, diminished in understanding.
6 If in thy youth thou hast not gathered, then how shalt thou find [it] in thine old age?
7 How beautiful is gray-haired judgment, and for elders to know counsel!
8 How beautiful is the wisdom of old men, and for them that are glorified, their thought and counsel!
9 The crown of old men is manifold experience, and their glorying is the fear of the Lord.
10 Nine reflections did I deem blessed in my heart,
11 and the tenth shall I speak upon my tongue:
A man rejoicing in his children,
12 living and looking upon the downfall of [his] enemies.
13 Blessed is he that dwelleth with a sensible wife,
and he that in his tongue hath not slipped,
14 and he that hath not served one unworthy of himself.
Blessed is he that hath found prudence,
15 and he that relateth [it] into the ears of them that hear.
How great is he that hath found wisdom!
16 But there is none above him that feareth the Lord.
The love of the Lord hath surpassed all things unto enlightenment;
17 he that holdeth her, unto whom shall he be likened?
18 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of love for Him;
and faith is the beginning of cleaving unto Him.
19 Let there be every wound, but let there not be a wound of the heart.
20 And every wickedness, but not the wickedness of a woman.
And every affliction, but not the affliction of haters.
21 And every vengeance, but...
