**11** τὰς τὴν πόλιν κατὰ τοῦ τείχους ἐκρήμνισαν. Ἕτεροι δὲ πλήσιον συνδραμόντες εἰς τὰ σπήλαια, λεληθότως ἄγειν τὴν ἑβδομάδα, μηνυθέντες τῷ Φιλίππῳ συνεφλογίσθησαν, διὰ τὸ εὐλαβῶς ἔχειν βοηθῆσαι αὐτοῖς κατὰ δόξαν τῆς σεμνοτάτης ἡμέρας. **12** Παρακαλῶ οὖν τοὺς ἐντυγχάνοντας τῇδε τῇ βίβλῳ μὴ συσέλλεσθαι διὰ τὰς συμφοράς, λογίζεσθαι δὲ τὰς τιμωρίας μὴ πρὸς ὄλεθρον, ἀλλὰ πρὸς παιδείαν τοῦ γένους ἡμῶν εἶναι. **13** Καὶ γὰρ τὸ μὴ πολὺν χρόνον ἐᾶσθαι τοὺς δυσσεβοῦντας, ἀλλ᾽ εὐθέως περιπίπτειν τοῖς ἐπιτιμίοις, μεγάλης εὐεργεσίας σημεῖόν ἐστιν. **14** Οὐ γὰρ καθάπερ καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν ἄλλων ἐθνῶν ἀναμένει μακροθυμῶν ὁ δεσπότης μέχρι τοῦ καταντήσαντας αὐτοὺς πρὸς ἐκπλήρωσιν ἁμαρτιῶν κόλασιν, οὕτως καὶ ἐφ᾽ ἡμῶν ἔκρινεν εἶναι **15** ἵνα μὴ πρὸς τέλος ἀφικωμένων ἡμῶν τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν ὕστερον ἡμᾶς ἐκδικᾷ. **16** Διόπερ οὐδέ ποτε μὲν τὸν ἔλεον αὐτοῦ ἀφ᾽ ἡμῶν ἀφίστησι· παιδεύων δὲ μετὰ συμφορᾶς, οὐκ ἐγκαταλείπει τὸν ἑαυτοῦ λαόν. **17** Πλὴν ἕως ὑπομνήσεως ταῦθ᾽ ἡμῖν εἰρήσθω· δι᾽ ὀλίγων δὲ ἐλευστέον ἐπὶ τὴν διήγησιν. **18** Ἐλεάζαρός τις τῶν πρωτευόντων γραμματέων ἀνὴρ ἤδη προβεβηκὼς τὴν ἡλικίαν καὶ τὴν πρόσοψιν τοῦ προσώπου κάλλιστος ἀναγαίνων ἠναγκάζετο φαγεῖν ὕειον κρέας. **19** Ὁ δὲ τὸν μετ᾽ εὐκλείας θάνατον μᾶλλον ἢ τὸν μετὰ μύσους βίον ἀναδιεξάμενος αὐθαιρέτως ἐπὶ τὸ τύμπανον προσῆγε. **20** Προπτύσας δὲ, καθ᾽ ὃν ἔδει τρόπον προσέρχεσθαι τοὺς ὑπομένοντας ἀμύνεσθαι, ὧν οὐ θέμις γεύσασθαι διὰ τὴν πρὸς τὸ ζῆν φιλοστοργίαν. **21** Οἱ δὲ πρὸς τῷ παρανόμῳ σπλαγχνισμῷ τεταγμένοι διὰ τὴν ἐκ τῶν παλαιῶν χρόνων πρὸς τὸν ἄνδρα γνῶσιν ἀπολαμβάνοντες αὐτὸν κατ᾽ ἰδίαν παρεκάλουν, ἐνεγκόντα κρέα, οἷς καθῆκον αὐτῷ χρῆσθαι, δι᾽ αὐτοῦ παρασκευασθέντα, ὑποκριθῆναι δὲ ὡς ἐσθίοντα τὰ ὑπὸ τοῦ βασιλέως τεταγμένα τῶν ἀπὸ τῆς θυσίας κρεῶν **22** ἵνα τοῦτο πράξας ἀπολυθῇ τοῦ θανάτου, καὶ διὰ τὴν ἀρχαίαν πρὸς αὐτοὺς φιλίαν τύχῃ φιλανθρωπίας. **23** Ὁ δὲ λογισμὸν ἀστεῖον ἀναλαβὼν καὶ ἄξιον τῆς ἡλικίας καὶ τῆς τοῦ γήρους ὑπεροχῆς καὶ τῆς ἐπικτήτου καὶ ἐπιφανοῦς πολιᾶς καὶ τῆς ἐκ παιδὸς καλλίστης ἀνατροφῆς, μᾶλλον δὲ τῆς ἁγίας καὶ θεοκτίστου νομοθεσίας ἀκολούθως ἀπεφήνατο, ταχέως λέγων **24** προπέμπειν εἰς τὸν ᾅδην.

#### CHAPTER VI.

**11** them did they cast down from the wall of the city. Others, gathered nigh, fled into the caves to keep the Sabbath secretly; and being discovered unto Philip, they were burnt together [with fire], for that they held it in reverence to succor themselves, for the honor of that most sacred day.

**12** Now therefore, I beseech all those who shall encounter this book, that ye be not disheartened by these calamities, but that ye account these chastisements not as unto utter destruction, but rather for the discipline and instruction of our nation. **13** For indeed, that the ungodly are not permitted [to continue] for a long season, but straightway do fall into [their appointed] penalties, is a token of great beneficence. **14** For not as with other nations doth the Lord tarry in His long-suffering until they should attain to the fullness of [their] sins [and so receive] punishment; **15** even so did He judge it to be concerning us, lest, our sins having come to their full measure, should He afterwards avenge Himself upon us. **16** Wherefore, He never ceaseth to extend His mercy from us; but disciplining [us] with calamity, He doth not forsake His own people. **17** Nevertheless, let these things be spoken unto us by way of reminder; but in few words must we now proceed to the narrative.
