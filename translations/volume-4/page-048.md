ΚΕΦ. Ιϛ΄.
τὴν λινῆν εἰς ἀπάτην αὐτοῦ. Τὸ σκάνδαλον αὐτῆς ἥρπασεν ὀφθαλ- **9**
μὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὸ κάλλος αὐτῆς ἠχμαλώτισε ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ, διῆλ-
θεν ἀκινάκης τὸν τράχηλον αὐτοῦ. Ἔφριξαν Πέρσαι τὴν τόλ- **10**
μην αὐτῆς, καὶ Μῆδοι τὸ θράσος αὐτῆς ἐξέφραξαν. Τότε ἠλά- **11**
λαζαν οἱ ταπεινοί μου, καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν οἱ ἀσθενοῦντές μου, καὶ
ἐπτόηθησαν· ὕψωσαν τὴν φωνὴν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἀνετράπησαν. Υἱοὶ **12**
κορασίων κατεκέντησαν αὐτούς, καὶ ὡς παῖδας αὐτομολοῦντων
ἐπίτρωσκον αὐτούς. ἀπώλοντο ἐκ παρατάξεως Κυρίου μου. Ὑμνή- **13**
σω τῷ Κυρίῳ ὕμνον καινόν. Κύριε, μέγας εἶ, καὶ ἔνδοξος, θαυμα-
στὸς ἐν ἰσχύϊ, ἀνυπέρβλητος. Σοὶ δουλευέτω πᾶσα ἡ κτίσις σου· **14**
ἔτι εἶπας, καὶ ἐγενήθησαν· ἀπέστειλας τὸ πνεῦμά σου, καὶ ᾠκο-
δόμησε· καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ὡς ἀντιστήσεται τῇ φωνῇ σου. Ὄρη γὰρ **15**
ἐκ θεμελίων σὺν ὕδατι σαλευθήσεται, πέτραι δὲ ἀπὸ προσώπου
σου ὡς κηρὸς τακήσεται· ἐπὶ δὲ τοῖς φοβουμένοις σε σὺ εὐϊλατεύ-
εις αὐτοῖς. Ὅτι μικρὸν πᾶσα θυσία εἰς ὀσμὴν εὐωδίας, καὶ ἐλά- **16**
χιστον πᾶν στέαρ εἰς ὁλοκαύτωμά σοι. Ὁ δὲ φοβούμενος τὸν Κύ-
ριον, μέγας διαπαντός. Οὐαὶ ἔθνεσιν ἐπανισταμένοις τῷ γένει **17**
μου, Κύριος παντοκράτωρ ἐκδικήσει αὐτοὺς ἐν ἡμέρᾳ κρίσεως,
δοῦναι πῦρ καὶ σκώληκας εἰς σάρκας αὐτῶν, καὶ κλαύσονται ἐν αἰ-
σθήσει ἕως αἰῶνος. Ὡς δὲ ἦλθοσαν εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ, προσεκύνησαν **18**
τῷ Θεῷ. καὶ ἡνίκα ἐκαθαρίσθη ὁ λαός, ἀνήνεγκαν τὰ ὁλοκαυ-
τώματα αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰ ἑκούσια αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰ δόματα αὐτῶν.
Καὶ ἀνέθηκεν Ἰουδὶθ πάντα τὰ σκεύη Ὀλοφέρνου, ὅσα ἔδωκεν ὁ **19**
λαὸς αὐτῇ, καὶ τὸ κωνωπεῖον ὃ ἔλαβεν αὐτῇ ἐκ τοῦ κοιτῶνος αὐ-
τοῦ, εἰς ἀνάθημα τῷ Κυρίῳ ἔδωκε. Καὶ ἦν ὁ λαὸς εὐφραινόμενος **20**
εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ κατὰ πρόσωπον τῶν ἁγίων ἐπὶ μῆνας τρεῖς, καὶ
Ἰουδὶθ μετ᾿ αὐτῶν κατέμενε. Μετὰ δὲ ταύτας τὰς ἡμέρας ἀνέ- **21**
ζευξεν ἕκαστος εἰς τὴν κληρονομίαν ἑαυτοῦ. καὶ Ἰουδὶθ ἀπῆλθεν
εἰς Βετυλούα, καὶ κατέμεινεν ἐπὶ τῆς ὑπάρξεως αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐγένε-
το κατὰ τὸν καιρὸν αὐτῆς ἔνδοξος ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ. Καὶ πολλοὶ **22**
ἐπεθύμησαν αὐτήν, καὶ οὐκ ἔγνω ἀνὴρ αὐτὴν πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας
τῆς ζωῆς αὐτῆς, ἀφ᾿ ἧς ἡμέρας ἀπέθανε Μανασσῆς ὁ ἀνὴρ αὐτῆς,
καὶ προσετέθη πρὸς τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ προβαίνουσα ἦν μεγά- **23**
λη σφόδρα, καὶ ἐγήρασεν ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς αὐτῆς ἑκατὸν
πέντε ἔτη, καὶ ἀφῆκε τὴν ἄβραν αὐτῆς ἐλευθέραν, καὶ ἀπέθανεν
εἰς Βετυλούα, καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὴν ἐν τῷ σπηλαίῳ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς αὐτῆς

#### CHAPTER 16 (continued)

**8** ...[garment,] the linen one, to beguile him.

**9** Her enticement ensnared his eye, and her beauty captivated his soul; a scimitar passed through his neck.

**10** The Persians shuddered at her daring, and the Medes declared her boldness.

**11** Then my lowly ones cried aloud, and [the foe] were afraid, yea, they were affrighted; they lifted up their voice, and were overthrown.

**12** Sons of young women pierced them through, and like children of deserters did they wound them; they perished from the battle array of my Lord.

**13** I will sing unto the Lord a new hymn. O Lord, great art Thou, and glorious, wondrous in might, unconquerable.

**14** Let all Thy creation serve Thee; Thou didst but speak, and they were made; Thou didst send forth Thy Spirit, and it built [all things]; and there is none that shall resist Thy voice.

**15** For mountains from their foundations shall be shaken with water, and rocks before Thy face shall melt as wax; but to them that fear Thee, Thou art ever propitious.

**16** For every sacrifice is too small for a sweet-smelling savor, and all fat is too little for a burnt offering unto Thee. But he that feareth the Lord, is great for evermore.

**17** Woe unto the nations that rise up against my people! The Lord Almighty shall take vengeance upon them in the Day of Judgment, to give fire and worms unto their flesh; and they shall weep in torment unto the ages.

**18** And when they were come to Jerusalem, they worshipped God; and when the people had purified themselves, they offered up their burnt offerings, and their freewill offerings, and their gifts.

**19** And Judith dedicated all the belongings of Holofernes, even all that the people had given her; and the canopy which she had taken for herself from his bedchamber, did she give as a votive offering unto the Lord.

**20** And the people rejoiced in Jerusalem before the holy place for three months; and Judith abode with them.

**21** And after these days, each man departed unto his own inheritance; and Judith went away to Bethulia, and abode upon her own estate, and she became in her time glorious throughout all the land.

**22** And many desired her, but no man knew her all the days of her life, from the day that Manasseh her husband died, and was gathered unto his people.

**23** And she continued to be very great, and she grew old in the house of her husband, having lived one hundred and five years; and she set her maidservant free, and died in Bethulia; and they buried her in the cave of her husband.
