17 συμμαχίαν τὴν προτέραν. Ἐνετειλάμεθα οὖν αὐτοῖς καὶ πρὸς
ὑμᾶς πορευθῆναι, καὶ ἀσπάσασθαι ὑμᾶς, καὶ ἀποδοῦναι ὑμῖν τὰς
παρ᾿ ἡμῶν ἐπιστολὰς περὶ τῆς ἀνανεώσεως καὶ τῆς ἀδελφότητος
18 ἡμῶν. Καὶ νῦν καλῶς ποιήσετε ἀντιφωνήσαντες ἡμῖν πρὸς ταῦτα.
19 Καὶ τοῦτο τὸ ἀντίγραφον τῶν ἐπιστολῶν ὧν ἀπέστειλεν. Ὀνία.
20 Ἄρειος βασιλεὺς Σπαρτιατῶν, Ὀνίᾳ ἱερεῖ μεγάλῳ χαίρειν. Εὑ-
21 ρέθη ἐν γραφῇ περί τε τῶν Σπαρτιατῶν καὶ Ἰουδαίων, ὅτι ἀ-
δελφοί εἰσιν, καὶ ὅτι εἰσὶν ἐκ γένους Ἀβραάμ.
22 Καὶ νῦν ἀφ᾿ οὗ ἔγνωμεν ταῦτα, καλῶς ποιήσετε γράφοντες ἡμῖν περὶ τῆς εἰρή-
νης ὑμῶν.
23 Καὶ ἡμεῖς δὲ ἀντιγράφομεν ὑμῖν, τὰ κτήνη ὑμῶν καὶ καὶ ἡ ὕπαρξις ὑμῶν ἡμῖν ἐστι, καὶ τὰ ἡμῶν ὑμῖν ἐστιν· ἐντελ-
λόμεθα οὖν ὅπως ἀπαγγείλωσιν ὑμῖν κατὰ ταῦτα.
24 Καὶ ἠκούσεν Ἰωνάθαν ὅτι ἐπέστρεψαν οἱ ἄρχοντες Δημητρίου μετὰ δυνά-
μεως πολλῆς ὑπὲρ τοῦ πρότερον τοῦ πολεμῆσαι πρὸς αὐτόν.
25 Καὶ ἀπῆρεν ἐξ Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἀπήντησεν αὐτοῖς εἰς τὴν Ἀμαθῖ-
τιν χώραν· οὐ γὰρ ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς ἀνοχὴν τοῦ ἐμβατεῦσαι εἰς
τὴν χώραν αὐτοῦ.
26 Καὶ ἀπέστειλε κατασκόπους εἰς τὴν παρεμ-
βολὴν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν καὶ ἀπήγγειλαν αὐτῷ, ὅτι οὕτως
τάσσονται ἐπιπεσεῖν ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς τὴν νύκτα.
27 Ὡς δὲ ἔδυ ὁ ἥλιος, ἐπέταξεν Ἰωνάθαν τοῖς παρ᾿ αὐτοῦ γρηγορεῖν καὶ εἶναι ἐπὶ τοῖς
ὅπλοις, καὶ ἑτοιμάζεσθαι εἰς πόλεμον δι᾿ ὅλης τῆς νυκτός, καὶ
28 ἐξέβαλε προφύλακας κύκλῳ τῆς παρεμβολῆς. Καὶ ἤκουσαν οἱ
ὑπεναντίοι, ὅτι ἡτοίμασται Ἰωνάθαν καὶ οἱ παρ᾿ αὐτοῦ εἰς πό-
λεμον, καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν καὶ ἔπτηξαν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἀνέ-
καυσαν πυρὰς ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ αὐτῶν.
29 Καὶ ἀνεχώρησαν Ἰω-
νάθαν δὲ καὶ οἱ παρ᾿ αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἔγνωσαν ἕως πρωΐ· ἔβλεπον γὰρ
τὰ φῶτα καιόμενα.
30 Καὶ κατεδίωξεν Ἰωνάθαν ὀπίσω αὐτῶν, καὶ
31 οὐ κατέλαβεν αὐτούς, διέβησαν γὰρ τὸν Ἐλεύθερον ποταμόν. Καὶ
ἐξέκλινεν Ἰωνάθαν ἐπὶ τοὺς Ἄραβας τοὺς καλουμένους Ζαβα-
δαίους, καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτούς, καὶ ἔλαβε τὰ σκῦλα αὐτῶν.
32 Καὶ ἀναζεύξας ἦλθεν εἰς Δαμασκόν, καὶ διώδευσεν ἐν πάσῃ τῇ χώρᾳ.
33 Καὶ Σίμων ἐξῆλθε, καὶ διώδευσεν ἕως Ἀσκάλωνος, καὶ τῶν
πλησίον ὀχυρωμάτων, καὶ ἐξέκλινεν εἰς Ἰόππην, καὶ προκατε-
λάβετο αὐτήν.
34 Ἤκουσε γὰρ ὅτι βούλονται τὸ ὀχύρωμα παρα-
δοῦναι τοῖς παρὰ Δημητρίου, καὶ ἔθετο ἐκεῖ φρουράν, ὅπως φυ-
λάσσωσιν αὐτήν.
35 Καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν Ἰωνάθαν, καὶ ἐξεκκλησίασε τοὺς
