μῶν καὶ ἡ περὶ αὐτὸν ἀνυπόστατος δοκοῦσα εἶναι δύναμις, κα-
τεκόπησαν ἐν τῷ τῆς Ναναίας ἱερῷ, παραλογισμῷ χρησαμένων τῶν
περὶ τὴν Ναναίαν ἱερέων. Ὡς γὰρ συνοικίσην αὐτῇ παρεγένετο 14
εἰς τὸν τόπον ὅ τε ᾿Αντίοχος καὶ οἱ σὺν αὐτῷ φίλοι, χάριν τοῦ
λαβεῖν τὰ χρήματα πλείονα εἰς φερνῆς λόγον· Καὶ προθέντων 15
αὐτὰ τῶν ἱερέων τῆς Ναναίας, κἀκείνου προσελθόντος μετ’ ὀλίγων
εἰς τὸν περίβολον τοῦ τεμένους, συγκλείσαντες τὸ ἱερόν, ὡς εἰ-
σῆλθεν ᾿Αντίοχος, ἀνοίξαντες τὴν τοῦ φατνώματος κρυπτήν θύ- 16
ραν, βάλλοντες πέτρους συνεκεραύνωσαν τὸν ἡγεμόνα, καὶ μέλη
ποιήσαντες καὶ τὰς κεφαλὰς ἀφελόντες τοῖς ἔξω παρέδιδαν. Κα- 17
τὰ πάντα εὐλογητὸς ἡμῶν ὁ Θεός, ὃς παρέδωκε τοὺς ἀσεβήσαν-
τας. Μέλλοντες οὖν ἄγειν ἐν τῷ Χασελεὺ πέμπτῃ καὶ εἰκάδι τὸν 18
καθαρισμὸν τοῦ ἱεροῦ, δέον ἡγησάμεθα διασαφῆσαι ὑμῖν, ἵνα καὶ
αὐτοὶ ἄγητε τῆς σκηνοπηγίας καὶ τοῦ πυρός, ὅτε Νεεμίας ὁ οἰ-
κοδομήσας τό τε τὸ ἱερὸν καὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον, ἀνήνεγκε θυσίας.
Καὶ γὰρ ὅτε εἰς τὴν Περσικὴν ἤγοντο ἡμῶν οἱ πατέρες, οἱ τότε 19
εὐσεβεῖς ἱερεῖς λαβόντες ἀπὸ τοῦ πυρὸς τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου λαθραίως,
κατέκρυψαν ἐν κοιλώματι φρέατος τάξιν ἔχοντες ἄνυδρον, ἐν ᾧ
κατησφαλίσαντο, ὥστε πᾶσιν ἄγνωστον εἶναι τὸν τόπον. Διελ- 20
θόντων δὲ ἐτῶν ἱκανῶν, ὅτε ἔδοξε τῷ Θεῷ, ἀποσταλεὶς Νεεμίας
ὑπὸ τοῦ βασιλέως τῆς Περσίδος τοὺς ἐκγόνους τῶν ἱερέων τῶν
ἀποκρυψάντων ἔπεμψεν ἐπὶ τὸ πῦρ. Ὡς δὲ διεσάφησαν ἡμῖν μὴ 21
εὑρηκέναι πῦρ ἀλλὰ ὕδωρ παχύ, ἐκέλευσεν αὐτοὺς ἀποβάζαντας
φέρειν· ὡς δὲ ἀνηνέχθη τὰ τῶν θυσιῶν, ἐκέλευσε τοὺς ἱερεῖς Νεε-
μίας ἐπιρρᾶναι τῷ ὕδατι τά τε ξύλα καὶ τὰ ἐπικείμενα. Ὡς δὲ 22
ἐγένετο τοῦτο, καὶ χρόνος διῆλθεν ὅ τε ἥλιος ἀνέλαμψε πρότε-
ρον ἐπινεφὴς ὤν, ἀνήφθη πυρὰ μεγάλη, ὥστε θαυμάσαι πάντας.
Προσευχὴν δὲ ἐποιήσαντο οἱ ἱερεῖς δαπανωμένης τῆς θυσίας, οἵ τε 23
ἱερεῖς καὶ πάντες καταρχομένου ᾿Ιωνάθου, τῶν τε λοιπῶν ἐπι-
φωνούντων, ὡς Νεεμίου. Ἦν δὲ ἡ προσευχὴ τὸν τρόπον ἔχουσα 24
τοῦτον· Κύριε ὁ Θεὸς ὁ πάντων κτίστης, ὁ φοβερός, καὶ ὁ ἰσχυ-
ρός, καὶ δίκαιος, καὶ ἐλεήμων, ὁ μόνος βασιλεὺς καὶ χρηστός,
ὁ μόνος χορηγός, ὁ μόνος δίκαιος καὶ παντοκράτωρ καὶ αἰώνιος, 25
ὁ διασώζων τὸν ᾿Ισραὴλ ἐκ παντὸς κακοῦ, ὁ ποιήσας τοὺς πα-
τέρας ἐκλεκτούς, καὶ ἁγιάσας αὐτούς. Πρόσδεξαι τὴν θυσίαν ὑπὲρ 26
παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ σου ᾿Ισραήλ, καὶ διαφύλαξον τὴν μερίδα σου καὶ

...our leader and the power about him, which was thought to be irresistible, were cut
down in the temple of Nanæa, by the guile of the priests of Nanæa.
**14** For when Antiochus and his friends came unto the place, for her cohabitation, to receive the greater moneys as a dowry;
**15** And when the priests of Nanæa had set them forth, and he had drawn nigh with a few unto the enclosure of the sanctuary, they shut up the temple;
**16** and when Antiochus had entered, they opened the secret door of the panelled ceiling, and casting stones, they struck down the leader with a mighty blow, and having made them into pieces, and having cut off their heads, they delivered them to them that were without.
**17** Blessed in all things be our God, who hath delivered up them that dealt impiously.
**18** Therefore, as we are about to keep the purification of the temple on the twenty-fifth of Chislev, we have deemed it necessary to signify it unto you, that ye also may keep the Feast of Tabernacles and [the feast] of the fire, when Nehemiah, who built both the temple and the altar, offered sacrifices.
**19** For when our fathers were led away into Persia, the devout priests of that time secretly took fire from the altar, and hid it in the hollow of a well that had no water, and they made it safe there, so that the place was unknown to all.

**22** And when this was done, and a time had passed, when the sun shone forth, which before had been clouded, a great fire was kindled, so that all marvelled.
**23** And the priests made a prayer while the sacrifice was being consumed, both the priests and all [the people], with Jonathan leading them, and the rest responding, as Nehemiah [did].
**24** Now the prayer was after this manner: O Lord, God, Creator of all things, [Thou who art] terrible and mighty, and righteous, and merciful, the only King and good,
**25** the only Provider, the only Righteous One and Almighty and Eternal,
**26** who savest Israel from every evil, who hast made the fathers chosen, and hast sanctified them; accept this sacrifice for all Thy people Israel, and preserve Thine inheritance and
