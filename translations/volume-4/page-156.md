Ἀντιόχειαν ὑπεράγαν δυσημερήσας ἐπὶ τῇ τοῦ στρατοῦ διαφθορᾷ.
Καὶ ὁ τοῖς Ῥωμαίοις ἀναδεξάμενος φόρον ἀπὸ τῆς τῶν ἐν Ἱε- 36
ροσολύμοις αἰχμαλωσίας κατορθῶσαι, κατήγγελλεν ὑπέρμα-
χον ἔχειν τὸν Θεὸν τοὺς Ἰουδαίους, καὶ διὰ τὸν τρόπον τοῦτον
ἀτρώτους εἶναι τοὺς Ἰουδαίους διὰ τὸ ἀκολουθεῖν τοῖς ἑαυτοῦ
προτεταγμένοις νόμοις.

**ΚΕΦ. Θ΄. ΙΧ.**

ΠΕΡΙ δὲ τὸν καιρὸν ἐκεῖνον ἐτύγχανεν Ἀντίοχος ἀναλε- 1
λυκὼς ἀκόσμως ἐκ τῶν περὶ τὴν Περσίδα τόπων. Εἰσεληλύθει 2
γὰρ εἰς τὴν λεγομένην Περσέπολιν, καὶ ἐπεχείρησεν ἱεροσυλεῖν,
καὶ τὴν πόλιν συνέχγειν· διὰ δὴ τῶν πληθῶν ὁρμησάντων, ἐπὶ τὴν
τῶν ὅπλων βοήθειαν ἐτράπησαν· καὶ συνέβη τροπωθέντα τὸν Ἀν-
τίοχον ὑπὸ τῶν ἐγχωρίων ἀσχήμονα τὴν ἀναγωγὴν ποιήσασθαι.
Ὄντι δὲ αὐτῷ κατ᾽ Ἐκβάτανα προσέπεσε τὰ κατὰ Νικάνορα καὶ 3
τοὺς περὶ Τιμόθεον γεγονότα. Ἐπαρθεὶς δὲ τῷ θυμῷ ὤετο καὶ 4
τὴν τῶν πεφυγαδευκότων αὐτὸν κακίαν εἰς τοὺς Ἰουδαίους ἐνα-
περίσασθαι· διὸ συνέταξε τὸν ἁρματηλάτην ἀδιαλείπτως ἐλαύ-
νοντα κατατείνειν τὴν πορείαν, τῆς ἐξ οὐρανοῦ δὲ κρίσεως συνοῦ-
σης αὐτῷ· οὕτως γὰρ ὑπερηφάνως εἶπε· πολυάνδριον Ἰουδαίων
Ἱεροσόλυμα ποιήσω παραγενόμενος ἐκεῖ. Ὁ δὲ παντεπόπτης Κύ- 5
ριος ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ ἐπάταξεν αὐτὸν ἀνιάτῳ καὶ ἀοράτῳ
πληγῇ· ἄρτι δὲ αὐτοῦ καταλήξαντος τὸν λόγον, ἔλαβεν αὐτὸν
ἀνήκεστος τῶν σπλάγχνων ἀλγηδὼν, καὶ πικραὶ τῶν ἔνδον βά-
σανοι, πάνυ δικαίως τὸν πολλαῖς καὶ ξενιζούσαις συμφοραῖς ἐτέ- 6
ρων σπλάγχνα βασανίσαντα. Ὁ δ᾽ οὐδαμῶς τῆς ἀγερωχίας ἔληγε· 7
ἔτι δὲ καὶ τῆς ὑπερηφανίας ἐπεπλήρωτο, πῦρ πνέων τοῖς
θυμοῖς ἐπὶ τοὺς Ἰουδαίους, καὶ κελεύων ἐποξύνειν τὴν πορείαν·
συνέβη δὲ καὶ πεσεῖν αὐτὸν ἀπὸ τοῦ ἅρματος φερομένου ῥοίζῳ,
καὶ δυσχερεῖ πτώματι περιπεσόντα πάντα τὰ μέλη τοῦ σώματος
ἀποστρεβλοῦσθαι. Ὁ δ᾽ ἄρτι δοκῶν τοῖς τῆς θαλάσσης κύμασιν 8
ἐπιτάσσειν, διὰ τὴν ὑπὲρ ἀνθρώπων ὑπερηφανίαν, καὶ πλάστιγγι
τὰ τῶν ὀρέων οἰόμενος ὕψη στήσειν, κατὰ γῆν γενόμενος ἐν φο-
ρείῳ παρεκομίζετο, φανερὰν τοῦ Θεοῦ πᾶσι τὴν δύναμιν ἐνδει-
κνύμενος· Ὥστε καὶ ἐκ τοῦ σώματος τοῦ δυσσεβοῦς σκώληκας ἀ- 9

**36** ...he came unto Antioch, being exceedingly distressed over the destruction of the army. And he who had undertaken to levy a tribute for the Romans from the captivity of those in Jerusalem, to accomplish [his purpose], now proclaimed that the Jews had God as their supreme Defender, and that for this reason the Jews were invulnerable, because they followed their own appointed laws.

**Chapter 9**

**1** Now about that same time, Antiochus was retreating in disorder from the regions of Persia. **2** For he had entered into the city that is called Persepolis, and he attempted to profane the sanctuary, and to seize the city. But when the multitudes rushed forth, they turned to the help of weapons; and it came to pass that Antiochus, being routed by the inhabitants, made an ignominious retreat.

**3** Now whilst he was at Ecbatana, it befell him to hear of the things that had come to pass concerning Nicanor and those who were with Timothy. **4** But being lifted up with rage, he thought to pour out upon the Jews the wickedness of them who had put him to flight. Wherefore he commanded his charioteer to drive without ceasing and to hasten the journey, whilst the judgment from heaven did attend him. For thus he spake in his pride: "I will make Jerusalem a burying place of Jews when I come thither!"

**5** But the all-seeing Lord, the God of Israel, smote him with an incurable and an unseen plague. And no sooner had he ceased speaking, than an incurable pain of the bowels took hold of him, and bitter torments within him, **6** most justly [afflicting] him who had afflicted the bowels of others with many and strange misfortunes. **7** Yet did he by no means cease from his arrogance; yea, and he was yet filled with pride, breathing fire in his rage against the Jews, and commanding to quicken the journey. But it came to pass that he fell also from his chariot, which was borne along with a rushing sound, and having suffered a grievous fall, all the members of his body were dislocated.

**8** Now he who but just now thought to command the waves of the sea, because of his pride that exceeded [that of] men, and deemed that he could weigh the heights of the mountains with a scale, being brought low to the ground, was carried in a litter, thereby manifesting plainly unto all the power of God. **9** Insomuch that even from the body of that wicked man, worms did boil forth,
