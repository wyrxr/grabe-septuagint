ΚΕΦ. ΙΘʹ. ΧΙΧ.
1 ΕΡΓΑΤΗΣ μέθυσος οὐ πλουτισθήσεται· καὶ ὁ ἐξουθενῶν τὰ
2 ὀλίγα κατὰ μικρὸν πεσεῖται. Οἶνος καὶ γυναῖκες ἀποσώσουσι συνετοὺς, καὶ ὁ κολλώμενος πόρναις τολμηρότερος ἔσται·
3 σῆψις καὶ σκώληκες κληρονομήσουσιν αὐτὸν, καὶ ψυχὴ τολμηρὰ ἐξαρθήσεται ἐν παραδειγματισμῷ μείζονι.
4 Ὁ ταχὺ ἐμπιστεύων κοῦφος καρδίᾳ· καὶ ὁ ἁμαρτάνων εἰς ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ, πλημμελήσει.
5 Ὁ εὐφραινόμενος καρδίᾳ, ἐπὶ κακοεξίᾳ καταγνωσθήσεται· ὁ δὲ ἀντοφθαλμῶν ἡδονῇ, στεφανοῖ τὴν ζωὴν αὐτοῦ.
6 Ὁ ἐγκρατευόμενος γλώσσῃ, ἀμάχως συμβιώσεται· καὶ ὁ μισῶν λαλιὰν ἐλαττονοῦται κακία.
7 Μηδέποτε δευτερώσῃς λόγον, καὶ οὐθέν σοι οὐ μὴ ἐλαττονωθῇ.
8 Ἐν φίλῳ καὶ ἐν ἐχθρῷ μὴ διηγοῦ βίους ἀλλοτρίους, καὶ
9 εἰ μὴ ἔστί σοι ἁμαρτία, μὴ ἀποκάλυπτε· ἀκήκοε γάρ σου καὶ
10 ἐφυλάξατό σε, καὶ ἐν καιρῷ μισήσει σε.
11 Ἀκήκοας λόγον, συναποθανέτω σοι· θάρσει, οὐ μή σε ῥήξει.
12 Ἀπὸ προσώπου λόγου ὠδινήσει μωρὸς, ὡς ἀπὸ προσώπου βρέφους ἡ τίκτουσα·
13 βέλος πεπηγὸς ἐν μηρῷ σαρκὸς, οὕτως λόγος ἐν κοιλίᾳ μωροῦ. Ἔλεγξον φίλον μήποτε οὐκ ἐποίησε, καὶ εἴ τι ἐποίησε, μήποτε προσθῇ·
14 ἔλεγξον τὸν φίλον, μήποτε οὐκ εἶπε, καὶ εἰ εἴρηκεν, ἵνα μὴ δευτερώσῃ·
15 ἔλεγξον φίλον, πολλάκις γὰρ γίνεται διαβολὴ, καὶ μὴ
16 παντὶ λόγῳ πίστευε. Ἔστιν ὀλισθαίνων λόγῳ, καὶ οὐκ ἀπὸ ψυχῆς·
17 καὶ τίς οὐχ ἥμαρτεν ἐν τῇ γλώσσῃ αὐτοῦ; Ἔλεγξον τὸν πλησίον σου πρὶν ἀπειλῆσαι, καὶ δὸς τόπον νόμῳ ὑψίστου γινόμενος ἀμηνής.
18 Φόβος Κυρίου ἀρχὴ προσλήψεως· σφόδρα δὲ παρ’ αὐτοῦ ἀγάπησιν περιποιεῖ.
19 Γνῶσις ἐντολῶν Κυρίου παιδεία ζωῆς· οἱ δὲ ποιοῦντες τὰ ἀρεστὰ αὐτῷ, ἀθανασίας δένδρον καρποῦνται.
20 Πᾶσα σοφία φόβος Κυρίου, καὶ ἐν πάσῃ σοφίᾳ ποίησις νόμου καὶ γνῶσις τῆς παντοκρατορίας αὐτοῦ.
21 Οἰκέτης λέγων τῷ δεσπότῃ· ὡς ἀρέσκει οὐ ποιήσω, ἐὰν μετὰ ταῦτα ποιήσῃ, παροργίζει τὸν τρέφοντα αὐτόν.
22 (Καὶ) οὐκ ἔστι σοφία πονηρίας ἐπ' ἰσήμη, καὶ οὐκ ἔστι βουλὴ ἁμαρτωλῶν φρόνησις·
23 ἔστι πανουργία, καὶ αὕτη βδέλυγμα, καὶ ἔστιν ἄφρων ἐλαττούμενος σοφίᾳ.
24 Κρείττων ἡττώμενος ἐν συνέσει ἔμφοβος, ἢ περισσεύων ἐν συνέσει καὶ παραβαίνων νόμον ὑψίστου.
25 Ἔστι πανουργία ἀκριβὴς, καὶ αὕτη ἄδικος, καὶ ἔστι διαστρέφων χάριν τοῦ ἐκφᾶναι κρῖμα·

ΚΕΦ. Κʹ. ΧΧ.

1 ἜΣΤΙΝ ἔλεγχος ὃς οὐκ ἔστιν ὡραῖος· καὶ ἔστι σιωπῶν, καὶ αὐτὸς φρόνιμος.
2 Ὡς καλὸν ἐλέγξαι ἢ θυμοῦσθαι κρυπτῶς· καὶ ὁ ἀνθομολογούμενος ἀπὸ ἐλαττώσεως κωλυθήσεται.
3 Ὡς καλὸν ἐλεγχθέντα φανερῶσαι μετάνοιαν· οὕτως γὰρ φεύξει ἑκούσιον ἁμάρτημα.
4 Ἐπιθυμία εὐνούχου ἀποπαρθενῶσαι νεάνιδα· οὕτως ὁ ποιῶν ἐν βίᾳ χρήματα.
5 Ἔστι σιωπῶν εὑρισκόμενος σοφός, καὶ ἔστι μισητός ἀπὸ πολλῆς λαλιᾶς.
6 Ἔστι σιωπῶν, οὐ γὰρ ἔχει ἀπόκρισιν· καὶ ἔστι σιωπῶν, εἰδὼς καιρόν.
7 Ἄνθρωπος σοφὸς σιγήσει ἕως καιροῦ· ὁ δὲ λαπιστὴς καὶ ἄφρων ὑπερβήσεται καιρόν.
8 Ὁ πλεονάζων λόγῳ βδελυχθήσεται, καὶ ὁ ἐξουσιαζόμενος μισηθήσεται.
9 Ἔστιν εὐοδία ἐν κακοῖς ἀνδρί, καὶ ἔστιν εὕρεμα εἰς ἐλάττωσιν.
10 Ἔστι δόσις ἡ οὐ λυσιτελήσει σοι, καὶ ἔστι δόσις ἧς τὸ ἀνταπόδομα διπλοῦν.
11 Ἔστιν ἐλάττων ἕνεκεν δόξης, καὶ ἔστιν ὃς ἀπὸ ταπεινώσεως ἦρε κεφαλήν.
12 Ἔστιν ὁ ἀγοράζων πολλὰ ὀλίγου, καὶ ἀποτίννων αὐτὰ ἑπταπλάσιον.
13 Ὁ σοφὸς ἐν λόγοις ἑαυτὸν προσφιλῆ ποιήσει· χάριτες δὲ μωρῶν ἐκχυθήσονται.
14 Δόσις ἄφρονος οὐ λυσιτελήσει σοι λαβόντι, ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ βασκάνου δι’ ἀνάγκην αὐτοῦ· οἱ γὰρ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτοῦ ἀνθ’ ἑνὸς εἰς τὸ λαβεῖν πολλοί·
15 ὀλίγα δώσει καὶ πολλὰ ὀνειδίσει, καὶ ἀνοίξει τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ ὡς κῆρυξ· σήμερον δανείσει, καὶ αὔριον ἀπαιτήσει· μισητὸς ἄνθρωπος ὁ τοιοῦτος Κυρίῳ καὶ ἀνθρώποις.
16 Μωρὸς ἐρεῖ· οὐχ ὑπάρχει μοι φίλος, καὶ οὐκ ἔστι χάρις τοῖς ἀγαθοῖς μου· οἱ ἔσθοντες τὸν ἄρτον μου, φαῦλοι γλώσσῃ.
17 Ποσάκις καὶ ὅσοι καταγελάσονται αὐτοῦ; οὔτε γὰρ τὸ ἔχειν ἐν ὀρθῇ αἰσθήσει εἴληφε, καὶ τὸ μὴ ἔχειν ὁμοίως ἀδιάφορον αὐτῷ.
18 Ὀλίσθημα ἀπὸ ἐδάφους μᾶλλον ἢ ἀπὸ γλώσσης· οὕτως πτῶσις κακῶν κατὰ σπουδὴν ἥξει.

**Chapter Nineteen**

A drunken laborer shall not be made rich;
and he that despiseth small things shall fall little by little.
Wine and women shall destroy the understanding;
and he that cleaveth unto harlots shall be more audacious.
Decay and worms shall inherit him,
and a bold soul shall be taken away unto a greater [public] punishment.
He that is swift to trust is light of heart;
and he that sinneth against his own soul shall commit transgression.
He that rejoiceth in heart shall be condemned for his evil habits;
but he that resisteth pleasure doth crown his own life.
He that exerciseth self-control over his tongue shall live in peace;
and he that hateth much babbling, his wickedness is diminished.
Never repeat a word,
and nothing [of thy reputation] shall be diminished unto thee.
Neither with a friend nor with an enemy recount thou the lives of others;
and if thou hast no sin [of thine own to confess], do not reveal [others' secrets];
for he hath heard [from] thee and hath kept watch over thee,
and in [due] time shall he hate thee.
Hast thou heard a word? Let it die with thee.
Be of good courage, it shall not burst thee.
At the sight of a word shall a fool travail,
even as she that giveth birth at the sight of her babe.
As an arrow stuck fast in the thigh of the flesh,
so is a word in the belly of a fool.
Reprove thy friend, lest perchance he did it not;
and if he hath done anything, lest he add [to his misdeed].
Reprove thy friend, lest perchance he spake it not;
and if he hath spoken it, that he may not repeat [it].
Reprove thy friend, for oft-times doth slander arise;
and to every word give credence.
There is one who doth slip in speech, and not from his soul [doth he speak];
and who hath not sinned with his tongue?
Reprove thy neighbor before thou threatenest,
and give place to the Law of the Most High, becoming without resentment.
The fear of the Lord is the beginning of [the] reception [of wisdom];
and greatly doth it procure love from Him.
The knowledge of the commandments of the Lord is the discipline of life;
and they that do the things pleasing unto Him
shall bear fruit as the tree of immortality.
All wisdom is the fear of the Lord;
and in all wisdom is the doing of the Law
and the knowledge of His Omnipotence.
A servant who saith unto his master, "I will not do that which pleaseth thee,"
if he do it thereafter, doth still provoke him that feedeth him.
And there is no wisdom of wickedness for a sign [of virtue],
neither is the counsel of sinners prudence.
There is cunning, and this same is an abomination;
and there is a fool who is lacking in wisdom.
Better is he that is humble in understanding, [and] fearful [of God],
than he that aboundeth in understanding and doth transgress the Law of the Most High.
There is a cunning that is exact, and this same is unjust;
and there is one who doth distort grace for the purpose of bringing forth judgment.

**Chapter Twenty**

There is a reproof which is not timely;
and there is one who is silent, and he himself is prudent.
How good it is to reprove than to be angry secretly;
and he that confesseth shall be hindered from further failing.
How good it is, when one is reproved, to show forth repentance;
for thus shall he flee from voluntary sin.
The desire of a eunuch is to deflower a virgin;
so also is he that maketh money by violence.
There is one who, by being silent, is found wise;
and there is one who is hated for much speaking.
There is one who is silent, for he hath no answer;
and there is one who is silent, knowing the opportune time.
A wise man will keep silence until the opportune time;
but the chatterer and the fool shall pass over the opportune time.
He that aboundeth in words shall be abhorred,
and he that usurpeth authority shall be hated.
There is prosperity for a man in evils,
and there is a finding that leadeth to loss.
There is a gift which shall not profit thee,
and there is a gift of which the recompense is double.
There is one who is lessened for the sake of glory,
and there is one who, from humility, hath lifted up his head.
There is one who buyeth many things for a small price,
and repayeth them sevenfold.
The wise man in words shall make himself beloved;
but the graces of fools shall be poured out [in vain].
The gift of a fool shall not profit thee who receivest it,
and likewise also that of an envious man, through his own necessity;
for his eyes, instead of one, are many for receiving.
Few things shall he give, and many things shall he reproach;
and he shall open his mouth as a herald.
Today shall he lend, and tomorrow shall he demand repayment.
Such a man is hateful to the Lord and to men.
A fool shall say, "There is no friend for me,
and there is no favor for my good deeds;
they that eat my bread are wicked in tongue."
How oft and by how many shall he be derided?
For neither hath he received the having of possessions with right judgment,
and the not having them is likewise indifferent to him.
A fall from the ground is better than a slip from the tongue;
thus shall the downfall of the wicked come swiftly.
