ΚΕΦ. Ζʹ.
καθὰ ἐλάλησαν. Καὶ ἀπῆραν παρεμβολὴν
αὐτῶν χιλιάδες πέντε υἱῶν Ἀσσούρ· καὶ παρενέβαλον ἐν τῷ αὐλῶν, καὶ προκατελάβοντο τὰ ὕδατα, καὶ τὰς πηγὰς τῶν ὑδάτων
τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἀνέβησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἡσαῦ, καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Ἀμμών, καὶ παρενέβαλον ἐν τῇ ὀρεινῇ ἀπέναντι Δωθαείμ, καὶ ἀπέστειλαν ἐξ αὐτῶν πρὸς νότον καὶ ἀπηλιώτην ἀπέναντι Ἐφραἐφὰ ἡ ἐστι πλησίον Χουσεὶ, ἢ ἐστιν ἐπὶ τοῦ χειμάρρου Μοχμούρ,
καὶ ἡ λοιπὴ στρατιὰ τῶν Ἀσσυρίων παρενέβαλον ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ,
καὶ ἐκάλυψαν πᾶν τὸ πρόσωπον τῆς γῆς· καὶ αἱ σκηναὶ καὶ αἱ
ἀπαρτίαι αὐτῶν κατεστρατοπέδευσαν ἐν ὄχλῳ πολλῷ, καὶ ἦσαν
εἰς πλῆθος πολὺ σφόδρα. Καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἀνεβόησαν πρὸς
Κύριον Θεὸν αὐτῶν, ὅτι ὠλιγοψύγησε τὸ πνεῦμα αὐτῶν, ὅτι ἐκύκλωσαν αὐτοὺς πάντες οἱ ἐχθροὶ αὐτῶν, καὶ οὐκ ἦν διαφυγεῖν
ἐκ μέσου αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἔμενον κύκλῳ αὐτῶν πᾶσα παρεμβολὴ Ἀσσούρ, οἱ πεζοὶ καὶ τὰ ἅρματα καὶ οἱ ἱππεῖς αὐτῶν, ἡμέρας τριακοντατέσσαρας. καὶ ἐξέλειπαν πάντας τοὺς κατοικοῦντας Βαιτυλούα πάντα τὰ ἀγγεῖα αὐτῶν τῶν ὑδάτων. Καὶ οἱ λάκκοι
ἐξεκενοῦντο, καὶ οὐκ εἶχον πιεῖν εἰς πλησμονὴν ὕδωρ ἡμέραν
μίαν, ὅτι ἐν μέτρῳ ἐδίδοσαν αὐτοῖς πιεῖν. Καὶ ἠθύμησαν τὰ
νήπια αὐτῶν, καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες αὐτῶν καὶ οἱ νεανίσκοι ἐξέλειπον
ἀπὸ τῆς δίψης, καὶ ἔπιπτον ἐν ταῖς πλατείαις τῆς πόλεως, καὶ
ἐν ταῖς διόδοις τῶν πυλῶν, καὶ οὐκ ἦν κραταίωσις ἔτι ἐν αὐτοῖς.
Καὶ ἐπισυνήχθησαν πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ἐπὶ Ὀζίαν καὶ τοὺς ἄρχοντας
τῆς πόλεως, οἱ νεανίσκοι καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες καὶ τὰ παιδία, καὶ ἐβόησαν φωνῇ μεγάλῃ, καὶ εἶπαν ἐναντίον πάντων τῶν πρεσβυτέρων· Κρῖναι ὁ Θεὸς ἀναμέσον ἡμῶν καὶ ὑμῶν, ὅτι ἐποιήσατε
ἐν ἡμῖν ἀδικίαν μεγάλην, οὐ λαλήσαντες εἰρηνικὰ μετὰ υἱῶν Ἀσσούρ. Καὶ νῦν οὐκ ἔστι βοηθὸς ἡμῶν, ἀλλὰ πέπρακεν ἡμᾶς ὁ
Θεὸς εἰς τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν, τοῦ καταστρωθῆναι ἐναντίον αὐτῶν
ἐν δίψῃ καὶ ἀπωλείᾳ μεγάλῃ. Καὶ νῦν ἐπικαλέσασθε αὐτοὺς, καὶ
ἔκδοσθε τὴν πόλιν πᾶσαν εἰς προνομὴν τῷ λαῷ Ὁλοφέρνου, καὶ
πάσῃ τῇ δυνάμει αὐτοῦ. Κρεῖσσον γὰρ ἡμᾶς γενηθῆναι αὐτοῖς εἰς
διαρπαγήν. ἐσόμεθα γὰρ εἰς δούλους, καὶ ζήσεται ἡ ψυχὴ ἡμῶν,
καὶ οὐκ ὀψόμεθα τὸν θάνατον τῶν νηπίων ἡμῶν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς ἡμῶν, καὶ τὰς γυναῖκας καὶ τὰ τέκνα ἡμῶν ἐκλείπουσας τὰς
ψυχὰς αὐτῶν. Μαρτυρόμεθα ὑμῖν τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ τὴν γῆν καὶ

#### CHAPTER 7

17 as they had spoken. And five thousand of the sons of Asshur departed with their encampment; and they encamped in the valley, and beforehand seized the waters, and the springs of water of the children of Israel.
18 And the sons of Esau and the sons of Ammon ascended, and they encamped in the hill country opposite Dothaim; and they sent [men] from among them southward and eastward, opposite Ephraem, which lieth near Khousei, and which is upon the torrent of Mokhmour. And the rest of the army of the Assyrians encamped in the plain, and they covered all the face of the earth; and their tents and their provisions were pitched with a great multitude, and their number was exceeding great.
19 And the children of Israel cried out unto the Lord their God, for their spirit had grown faint, because all their enemies had surrounded them, and there was no means to escape from their midst.
20 And all the encampment of Asshur remained round about them—their footmen, and their chariots, and their horsemen—for thirty-four days. And all the vessels of water of them that dwelt in Bethulia did fail them.
21 And the cisterns were being emptied, and they had not water to drink unto their fill for one day, for by measure did they give them to drink.
22 And their little ones were sore disheartened, and their wives and young men did fail for thirst, and they fell in the broad ways of the city, and in the thoroughfares of the gates; and there was no strength left them.
23 And all the people were gathered together unto Uzziah and the rulers of the city—the young men, and the women, and the children—and they cried out with a loud voice, and they said before all the elders:
24 "Let God be judge betwixt us and you, for ye have wrought a great injustice against us, in that ye spake no words of peace with the sons of Asshur.
25 And now there is no helper for us, but God hath sold us into their hand, to be laid low before them by great thirst and destruction.
26 And now, summon them, and deliver up all the city for a spoil unto Holofernes' people, and unto all his host.
27 For it is better for us to become a prey unto them. For we shall be as bondservants, and our souls shall live; and we shall not see the death of our infants with our own eyes, nor our wives and children yielding up their souls.
28 We call to witness against you the heaven and the earth and..."
