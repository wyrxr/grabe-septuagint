κατὰ τοῦ ἔθνους τυραννίδος, νικήσαντες τὸν τύραννον τῇ ὑπομονῇ,
ὥστε δι᾿ αὐτῶν καταλῦσαι καὶ καθαρισθῆναι τὴν πατρίδα. Ἀλλὰ  12
καὶ περὶ τοῦ ζητουμένου αὐτίκα δὴ λέγειν ἐξέσται, ἀρξαμένῳ
τῆς ὑποθέσεως, ὥσπερ εἰώθα ποιεῖν, καὶ οὕτως εἰς τὸν περὶ αὐ-
τῶν τρέφομαι λόγον, δόξαν διδούς τῷ πανσόφῳ Θεῷ. Ζητοῦμεν  13
δὴ τοίνυν, εἰ αὐτοκράτωρ ἐστι παθῶν ὁ λογισμός. Διακρίνωμεν  14
δὲ, τί ποτέ ἐστι λογισμός; καὶ τί πάθος; καὶ πόσαι παθῶν ἰδέαι;
καὶ εἰ πάντων ἐπικρατεῖ τούτων ὁ λογισμός; Λογισμὸς μὲν δὴ  15
τοίνυν ἐστι νοῦς μετὰ ὀρθοῦ λόγου προτιμῶν τὸν σοφίας βίον.
Σοφία δὴ τοίνυν ἐστὶ γνῶσις θείων καὶ ἀνθρωπίνων πραγμάτων,  16
καὶ τῶν τούτων αἰτίων. Αὕτη δὴ τοίνυν ἐστὶν ἡ τοῦ νόμου  17
παιδεία˙ δι᾿ ἧς τὰ θεῖα σεμνῶς, καὶ τὰ ἀνθρώπινα συμφερόντως
μανθάνομεν. Τῆς δὲ σοφίας ἰδέαι καθεστᾶσι τέσσαρες, φρόνησις  18
καὶ δικαιοσύνη καὶ ἀνδρεία καὶ σωφροσύνη. Κυριωτάτη παθῶν  19
ἡ φρόνησις˙ ἐξ ἧς δὴ τῶν παθῶν ὁ λογισμὸς ἐπικρατεῖ. Παθῶν  20
δὲ φύσεις εἰσὶν αἱ περιεκτικώταται δύο, ἡδονή τε καὶ πόνος˙
τούτων δὲ ἑκάτερον καὶ περὶ τὸ σῶμα καὶ περὶ τὴν ψυχὴν πέφυκε.
Πολλαὶ δὲ καὶ περὶ τὴν ἡδονὴν καὶ τὸν πόνον παθῶν εἰσὶν  21
ἀκολουθίαι. Πρὸ μὲν οὖν τῆς ἡδονῆς ἐστιν ἐπιθυμία˙ μετὰ δὲ  22
τὴν ἡδονὴν, χαρά. Πρὸ δὲ τοῦ πόνου ἐστὶν φόβος˙ μετὰ δὲ  23
τὸν πόνον, λύπη. Θυμὸς δὲ κοινὸν πάθος ἐστὶν ἡδονῆς καὶ  24
πόνου, ἐὰν ἐννοηθῇ τις ὅτε αὐτῷ περιέπεσεν. Ἐν δὲ τῇ ἡδονῇ  25
ἐστι καὶ ἡ κακοήθης διάθεσις, πολυτροπωτάτη πάντων τῶν παθῶν
οὖσα. Κατὰ μὲν τὴν ψυχὴν ἀλαζονεία, καὶ φιλαργυρία, καὶ φιλοδοξία,  26
καὶ φιλονεικία, ἀπιστία καὶ βασκανία˙ κατὰ δὲ τὸ σῶμα,  27
παντοφαγία, καὶ λαιμαργία, καὶ μονοφαγία. Καθάπερ οὖν δυοῖν  28
τοῦ σώματος καὶ τῆς ψυχῆς φυτῶν ὄντων ἡδονῆς τε καὶ πόνου,
πολλαὶ τούτων τῶν φυτῶν εἰσι παραφυάδες. Ὧν ἑκάστην ὁ  29
πανγέωργος λογισμὸς περικαθαίρων τε καὶ ἀποκνίζων, καὶ περιπλέκων,
καὶ ἐπάρδων, καὶ πάντα τρόπον μετοχετεύων, ἐξημεροῖ τὰς τῶν
ἠθῶν καὶ παθῶν ὕλας. Ὁ γὰρ λογισμὸς τῶν μὲν ἀρετῶν ἐστιν  30
ἡγεμὼν, τῶν δὲ παθῶν αὐτοκράτωρ. Ἐπιθεώρει γε τοίνυν πρῶτον
δι᾿ αὐτῶν καλλονικῶν τῆς σωφροσύνης ἔργων, ὅτι αὐτοδέσποτός
ἐστι τῶν παθῶν ὁ λογισμός. Σωφροσύνη δὴ τοίνυν ἐστὶν  31
ἐπικράτεια τῶν ἐπιθυμιῶν. Τῶν δὲ ἐπιθυμιῶν αἱ μὲν εἰσι  32
ψυχικαί, αἱ δὲ σωματικαί˙ καὶ τούτων ἀμφοτέρων ὁ λογισμὸς  33
ἐπικρατεῖν φαίνεται. ᾿Επεὶ πόθεν κινούμενοι πρὸς τὰς ἀπειρημένας
τροφάς, ἀποτρεπόμεθα τὰς ἐξ ἑαυτῶν ἡδονάς; οὐχ ὅτι δύναται
τῶν ὀρέξεων ἐπικρατεῖν ὁ λογισμός; ἐγὼ μὲν οἶμαι. Τοιγαροῦν  34
ἐνύδρων ἐπιθυμοῦντες καὶ ὀρνέων καὶ τετραπόδων, καὶ παντοίων
βρωμάτων τῶν ἀπηγορευμένων ἡμῖν κατὰ τὸν νόμον ἀπεχόμεθα
διὰ τὴν τοῦ λογισμοῦ ἐπικράτειαν. ᾿Αντέχεται γὰρ τὰ τῶν  35
ὀρέξεων πάθη ὑπὸ τοῦ σώφρονος νοὸς ἀνακαμπτόμενα˙ καὶ φιμοῦται
πάντα τὰ τοῦ σώματος κινήματα ὑπὸ τοῦ λογισμοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. Β´. ΙΙ.

ΚΑΙ τί θαυμαστόν; εἰ αἱ τῆς ψυχῆς ἐπιθυμίαι πρὸς τὴν τοῦ  1
κάλλους μετουσίαν ἀκυροῦνται. Ταύτῃ γοῦν ὁ σώφρων ᾿Ιωσὴφ  2
ἐπαινεῖται, ὅτι τῷ λογισμῷ , καὶ τῇ διανοίᾳ περιεκράτησε τῆς
ἡδυπαθείας. Νέος γὰρ ὢν καὶ ἀκμάζων πρὸς συνουσιασμὸν ἠκύ-  3
ρωσε τῷ λογισμῷ τὸν τῶν παθῶν οἶστρον. Οὐ μόνον δὲ τὴν  4
τῆς ἡδυπαθείας οἰσφηλασίαν ἐπικρατεῖν ὁ λογισμὸς φαίνεται,
ἀλλὰ καὶ πάσης ἐπιθυμίας. Λέγει γοῦν ὁ νόμος˙ οὐκ ἐπιθυμήσεις  5
τὴν γυναῖκα τοῦ πλησίον σου, οὐδὲ ὅσα τοῦ πλησίον σου ἐστίν.
Καίτοι ὅτε μὴ ἐπιθυμεῖν ἡμᾶς εἴρηκεν ὁ νόμος, πολὺ πλέον πεί-  6
σαιμ᾽ ἂν ὑμᾶς, ὅτι τῶν ἐπιθυμιῶν κρατεῖν δύναται ὁ λογισμός,
ὥσπερ καὶ τῶν κωλυτικῶν τῆς δικαιοσύνης παθῶν. ᾿Επεὶ τίνα  7
τρόπον μονόφαγος τις ὢν τὸ ἦθος, καὶ γαστρίμαργος, καὶ μέθυσος,
μεταπαιδεύεται, εἰ μὴ δῆλον , ὅτι κύριός ἐστι τῶν παθῶν ὁ λογισμός;
Αὐτίκα γοῦν τῷ νόμῳ πολιτευόμενος, κἂν φιλάργυρός τις ᾖ,  8
βιάζεται τὸν ἑαυτοῦ τρόπον, τοῖς δεομένοις δανείζων χωρίς τόκων,
καὶ τὸ δάνειον τῶν ἑβδομάδων ἐνστάσεων χρεοκοπούμενος. Κἂν  9
φειδωλός τις ᾖ, ὑπὸ τοῦ νόμου κρατεῖται διὰ τὸν λογισμόν,
μήτε ἐπικαρπολογούμενος τοὺς ἀμητοὺς, μήτε ἐπιῤῥωγολογούμενος
τοὺς ἀμπελῶνας, καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν ἑτέρων ἐστιν ἐπιγνῶναι τοῦτο,  10
ὅτι τῶν παθῶν ἐστιν ὁ λογισμὸς κρατῶν. ῾Ο γὰρ νόμος καὶ
τῆς πρὸς γονεῖς εὐνοίας κρατεῖ, μὴ καταπροδιδούς  11
τὴν ἀρετὴν δι᾽ αὐτοὺς˙ καὶ τῆς πρὸς γαμετὴν φιλίας ἐπικρατεῖ,  12
διὰ παρανομίαν αὐτὴν ἀπελέγχων. Καὶ τῆς τέκνων φιλίας
κυριεύει, διὰ κακίαν αὐτὰ κολάζων, καὶ τῆς φίλων συνηθείας  13
δεσπόζει, διὰ πονηρίαν αὐτοὺς ἐξελέγχων. Καὶ μὴ νομίσητε παρά-

**CHAPTER I.**

**11** tyranny over the nation, having conquered the tyrant by their endurance, so that through them the homeland might be abolished and cleansed.
**12** But also concerning that which is sought, it shall be permitted straightway to speak, when I have begun the premise, as I am accustomed to do; and thus I do foster this discourse concerning them, giving glory to the All-wise God.
**13** Therefore then, we seek whether Reason be absolute master of the passions.
**14** Let us distinguish, then, what Reason truly is; and what passion is; and how many are the forms of passions; and whether Reason doth prevail over all these.
**15** Reason then, indeed, is the mind, which, with right principle, doth prefer the life of wisdom.
**16** Wisdom then, indeed, is the knowledge of things divine and human, and of the causes of these.
**17** This then, indeed, is the instruction of the Law; through which we learn divine things reverently, and human things expediently.
**18** And there are four forms of wisdom established: prudence, and righteousness, and fortitude, and temperance.
**19** Of the passions, prudence is the most sovereign virtue; for from it doth Reason prevail over the passions.
**20** Now the most comprehensive natures of the passions are two, namely, pleasure and pain; and each of these doth naturally exist both in the body and in the soul.
**21** And many are the attendant manifestations of passions both concerning pleasure and pain.
**22** Before pleasure, then, is desire; but after pleasure, joy.
**23** And before pain, is fear; but after pain, grief.
**24** Now wrath is a common passion of both pleasure and pain, if one doth consider when he fell into it.
**25** And in pleasure is also the malicious disposition, being the most manifold of all the passions.
**26** Now according to the soul, [there is] vainglory, and avarice, and love of glory, and contention, faithlessness and envy;
**27** but according to the body, gluttony for all things, and voracity, and solitary eating.
**28** As therefore there are two plants of the body and of the soul, [even] pleasure and pain, many are the offshoots of these plants.
**29** Each one of these, Reason, the universal husbandman, doth thoroughly cleanse and prune, and train, and water, and by every means doth divert, thereby taming the matter of habits and passions.
**30** For Reason is the leader of the virtues, and the absolute master of the passions.
**31** Consider then, first, through the gloriously victorious works of temperance, that Reason is absolute master over the passions. Temperance then, indeed, is the mastery of desires.
**32** Now of desires, some are of the soul, and others are of the body;
**33** and over both of these, Reason is seen to prevail. For from whence, being moved toward forbidden foods, do we turn away from the pleasures that arise from them? Is it not because Reason is able to prevail over appetites? I, for my part, do think so.
**34** Therefore, though we desire things of the waters, and of the fowls, and of the four-footed beasts, and all manner of meats forbidden unto us according to the Law, yet do we abstain, through the mastery of Reason.
**35** For the passions of the appetites are restrained by the temperate mind, being bent back; and all the movements of the body are muzzled by Reason.

**CHAPTER II.**

**1** And what is marvellous? if the desires of the soul are annulled concerning the partaking of [carnal] beauty.
**2** For this, then, is the temperate Joseph praised, because by reason, and by understanding, he overcame lust.
**3** For being young and in the prime of life for carnal union, he annulled by Reason the mad impulse of the passions.
**4** And not only is Reason seen to prevail over the mad urge of lust, but also over every desire.
**5** For the Law doth say: "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor whatsoever is thy neighbor's."
**6** Yet, since the Law hath told us not to covet, much more would I persuade you that Reason is able to control desires,
**7** even as it doth also control the passions which hinder righteousness. For in what manner doth one, whose habit it is to eat to excess, and who is gluttonous, and a drunkard, become re-educated, unless it be manifest that Reason is master of the passions?
**8** Immediately then, one who lives according to the Law, even if he be avaricious, doth force his own nature, lending unto those who have need without usury, and cancelling the loan in the cycles of the seventh years.
**9** And if one be stingy, he is constrained by the Law through Reason, neither gathering the gleanings of the harvests, nor gathering the fallen grapes of the vineyards;
**10** and it is possible to perceive this also concerning others, that Reason doth master the passions. For the Law doth also govern the affection towards parents, not utterly betraying
**11** virtue on account of them;
**12** and it doth prevail over the love for a wife, reproving her for lawlessness. And it doth govern the love for children, punishing them for wickedness;
**13** and it doth rule over the companionship of friends, convicting them for malice. And think not that it is contrary to
