**ΜΑΚΚΑΒΑΙΩΝ Αʹ. ΚΕΦ. ΙΒʹ.**

35 πρεσβυτέρους τοῦ λαοῦ, καὶ ἐβουλεύσατο μετ᾽ αὐτῶν τοῦ οἰκο-
36 δομῆσαι ὀχυρώματα ἐν τῇ Ἰουδαίᾳ, καὶ προσυψῶσαι τὰ τείχη Ἱερουσαλὴμ, καὶ ὑψῶσαι ὕψος μέγα ἀναμέσον τῆς ἄκρας καὶ τῆς πόλεως εἰς τὸ διαχωρίσαι αὐτὴν τῆς πόλεως, ἵνα ᾖ αὕτη κατὰ μόνας, ὅπως μήτε ἀγοράζωσι μήτε πωλῶσι.
37 Καὶ συνήχθησαν τοῦ οἰκοδομεῖν τὴν πόλιν, καὶ ἤγγισε τοῦ τείχους τοῦ χειμέρρου τοῦ ἐξ ἀπηλιώτου, καὶ ἐπεσκεύασαν τὸ καλούμενον Καφεναθά.
38 Καὶ Σίμων ᾠκοδόμησε τὴν Ἀδιδὰ ἐν τῇ Σεφήλᾳ, καὶ ὠχύρωσε θύρας καὶ μοχλούς.
39 Καὶ ἐζήτησε Τρύφων βασιλεῦσαι τῆς Ἀσίας, καὶ περιθέσθαι τὸ διάδημα καὶ ἐκτεῖναι χεῖρας ἐπὶ Ἀντίοχον τὸν βασιλέα.
40 Καὶ ηὐλαβήθη μή ποτε οὐκ ἐάσῃ αὐτὸν Ἰωναθαν, καὶ μή ποτε πολεμήσῃ πρὸς αὐτὸν, καὶ ἐζήτει πόρον τοῦ συλλαβεῖν αὐτὸν τοῦ ἀποκτεῖναι˙ καὶ ἀπάρας ἦλθεν εἰς Βεθσάν.
41 Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Ἰωναθαν εἰς ἀπάντησιν αὐτῷ ἐν τεσσαράκοντα χιλιάσιν ἀνδρῶν ἐπιλελεγμέναις εἰς παράταξιν, καὶ ἦλθεν εἰς Βεθσάν.
42 Καὶ εἶδε Τρύφων ἔτι πάρεστιν Ἰωναθαν μετὰ δυνάμεως πολλῆς, καὶ ἐκτεῖναι χεῖρας ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸν ηὐλαβήθη.
43 Καὶ ἐπεδέξατο αὐτὸν ἐνδόξως, καὶ συνέστησεν αὐτὸν πᾶσι τοῖς φίλοις αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ δόματα, καὶ ἐπέταξε τοῖς φίλοις αὐτοῦ καὶ ταῖς δυνάμεσιν αὐτοῦ ὑπακούειν αὐτῷ ὡς ἑαυτῷ.
44 Καὶ εἶπε τῷ Ἰωναθαν˙ ἱνατὶ ἔκοψας πάντα τὸν λαὸν τοῦτον πολέμου μὴ ἐνεστηκότος ἡμῖν;
45 Καὶ νῦν ἀπόστειλον αὐτοὺς εἰς τοὺς οἴκους αὐτῶν, ἐπίλεξον δὲ σεαυτῷ ἄνδρας ὀλίγους, οἵτινες ἔσονται μετὰ σοῦ, καὶ δεῦρο μετ᾽ ἐμοῦ εἰς Πτολεμαΐδα, καὶ παραδώσω σοι αὐτὴν καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ ὀχυρώματα καὶ τὰς δυνάμεις τὰς λοιπὰς καὶ πάντας τοὺς ἐπὶ τῶν χρειῶν, καὶ ἐπιστρέψας ἀπελεύσομαι˙ τούτου γὰρ χάριν πάρειμι.
46 Καὶ ἐμπιστεύσας αὐτῷ ἐποίησε καθὼς εἶπε, καὶ ἐξαπέστειλε τὰς δυνάμεις, καὶ ἀπῆλθεν εἰς γῆν Ἰούδα.
47 Κατέλιπε δὲ μεθ᾽ ἑαυτοῦ ἄνδρας τρισχιλίους, ὧν δισχιλίους ἀφῆκεν ἐν τῇ Γαλιλαίᾳ, χίλιοι δὲ συνῆλθον αὐτῷ.
48 Ὡς δὲ εἰσῆλθεν Ἰωναθαν εἰς Πτολεμαΐδα, ἀπέκλεισαν οἱ Πτολεμαῖται τὰς πύλας, καὶ συνέλαβον αὐτὸν, καὶ πάντας τοὺς συνελθόντας μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ ἀπέκτειναν ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ.
49 Καὶ ἀπέστειλε Τρύφων δυνάμεις καὶ ἵππον εἰς τὴν Γαλιλαίαν εἰς τὸ πεδίον τὸ μέγα, τοῦ ἀπολέσαι πάντας τοὺς παρὰ Ἰωναθου.
50 Καὶ ἐπέγνωσαν, ὅτι συνελήφθη Ἰωναθαν, καὶ ἀπόλωλε, καὶ οἱ μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ, καὶ παρεκάλεσαν ἑαυτούς, καὶ ἐπορεύοντο συνεστραμμένοι ἕτοιμοι εἰς πόλεμον.

**12:36** and to raise higher the walls of Jerusalem; and to erect a great height betwixt the citadel and the city, to the end that he might separate it from the city, that it might stand by itself, so that they might neither buy nor sell.
**12:37** And they were gathered together to build the city, and they drew nigh unto the wall of the winter torrent which is from the east; and they repaired that which is called Caphenatha.
