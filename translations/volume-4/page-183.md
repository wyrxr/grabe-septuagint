ΜΑΚΚΑΒΑΙΩΝ Γ. ΚΕΦ. Δ´.

μὲν τοῖς ζυγοῖς τῶν πλοίων προσηλωμένοι τοὺς τραχήλους, οἱ δὲ
10 τοὺς πόδας ἀῤῥήκτοις κατησφαλισμένοι πέδαις, ἔτι καὶ τῷ καθύπερθε πυκνῷ σανιδώματι διακειμένῳ τὸ φέγγος ἀποκλειόμενοι,
ὅπως πάντοθεν ἐσκοτισμένοι τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς, ἀγωγὴν ἐπιβούλῳ ἐν παντὶ τῷ κατάπλῳ λαμβάνωσιν. Τούτων δὲ ἐπὶ τὴν
11 λεγομένην σχεδίαν ἀχθέντων, καὶ τοῦ παράπλου περανθέντος, καθὼς ἦν δεδογματισμένον τῷ βασιλεῖ, προσέταξεν αὐτοὺς ἐν τῷ
πρὸ τῆς πόλεως ἱπποδρόμῳ παρεμβαλεῖν ἀπλάτῳ καθεστῶτι περιμέτρῳ, καὶ πρὸς παραδειγματισμὸν ἄγαν εὐκαιροτάτῳ καθεστῶτι πᾶσι τοῖς καταπορευομένοις ε᾽ς τὴν πόλην, καὶ τοῖς ἐκ
τούτων ε᾽ις τὴν χώραν στελλομένοις πρὸς ἐκδημίαν· πρὸς τὸ μηδὲ
ταῖς δυνάμεσιν αὐτοῦ κοινωνεῖν, μηδὲ τὸ σύνολον καταξιῶσαι περιβόλων.
12 Ὡς δὲ τοῦτο ἐγενήθη, ἀκούσας τοὺς ἐκ τῆς πόλεως
ὁμοεθνεῖς κρυβῇ ἐκπορευομένους πυκνότερον ἀποδύρεσθαι τὴν ἀκλεῆ τῶν ἀδελφῶν ταλαιπωρίαν,
13 διοργισθεὶς προσέταξε καὶ τούτοις ὁμοῦ τὸν αὐτὸν τρόπον ἐπιμελῶς ὡς ἐκείνοις ποιῆσαι, μὴ
14 λειπομένοις κατὰ μηδένα τρόπον τῆς ἐκείνων τιμωρίας· ἀπογραφῆναι δὲ πᾶν τὸ φῦλον ἐξ ὀνόματος· οὐκ ε᾽ις τὴν ἔμπροσθεν βραχεῖ προδεδηλωμένην τῶν ἔργων κατάπονον λατρείαν, στρεβλωθέντας δὲ παρηγγελμέναις αἰκίαις τὸ τέλος ἀφανίσαι μιᾶς ὑπὸ
15 καιρὸν ἡμέρας. Ἐγένετο μὲν οὖν ἡ τούτων ἀπογραφὴ μετὰ πικρᾶς σπουδῆς καὶ φιλοτίμου προστεδρίας ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν ἡλίου μέχρι δυσμῶν, ἀνήνυτον λαμβάνουσα τὸ τέλος ἐπὶ ἡμέρας τεσσαράκοντα.
16 Μεγάλως δὲ καὶ διηνεκῶς ὁ βασιλεὺς χαρᾷ πεπληρωμένος, συμπόσια ἐπὶ πάντων τῶν εἰδώλων συνιστάμενος, πεπλανημένῃ πέρῥω τῆς ἀληθείας φρενὶ καὶ βεβήλῳ στόματι, κωφὰ καὶ
μὴ δυνάμενα αὐτοῖς λαλεῖν ἢ ἀργήγειν, ἐπαινῶν, εἷς δὲ τὸν μέγιστον Θεὸν τὰ μὴ καθήκοντα λαλῶν.
17 Μετὰ δὲ τὸ προειρημένον τοῦ χρόνου διάστημα προσήνεγκαντο οἱ γραμματεῖς τῷ βασιλεῖ, μηκέτι ἰσχύειν τὴν τῶν Ἰουδαίων ἀπογραφὴν ποιεῖσθαι
18 διὰ τὴν ἀμέτρητον αὐτῶν πληθύν· καί περ ὄντων ἔτι κατὰ τὴν χώραν πλειόνων, τῶν μὲν κατὰ τὰς οἰκίας ἔτι συννεστηκότων, τῶν
δὲ καὶ κατὰ τὸν τόπον, ὡς ἀδυνάτου καθεστῶτος πᾶσι τοῖς ἐπ᾽
19 Αἴγυπτον στρατηγοῖς. Ἀπειλήσαντος δὲ αὐτοῖς σκληρότερον, ὡς
δεδωροκοπημένοις εἷς μηχανὴν τῆς ἐκφυγῆς, συνέβη σαφῶς αὐ-
20 τὸν περὶ τούτου πιστωθῆναι, λεγόντων μετὰ ἀποδείξεως, καὶ τὴν

**III Maccabees, Chapter 4**

**9** some indeed having their necks nailed to the yokes of the ships;
**10** whilst others, their feet secured with unbreakable fetters; and moreover, the light was shut off by reason of the thick planking laid overhead, so that, darkened in their eyes on every side, they might endure a treacherous passage throughout all their voyage.
**11** And when these were brought unto the so-called raft, and their coastal voyage was completed, as it had been decreed by the king, he commanded them to encamp in the hippodrome before the city, which was of boundless circuit and most opportune for a spectacle unto all those who came down into the city, and unto those who, from thence, departed into the country for sojourning; that they should neither share communion with his own forces, nor indeed be judged worthy of any enclosures.
**12** And when this came to pass, the king, hearing that their countrymen from the city were going forth secretly and more frequently to lament the inglorious tribulation of their brethren,
**13** being greatly angered, commanded that they should diligently do unto these also, in like manner, as unto the former,
**14** failing in no wise to inflict upon them the same punishment. And [he commanded] that the whole kindred should be registered by name, not for the grievous servitude of tasks heretofore briefly declared, but rather, that having been tortured by appointed afflictions, they should utterly be destroyed in the space of a single day.
**15** Therefore the registration of these was made with bitter earnestness and zealous diligence, from the rising of the sun until its setting, [yet] it continued for forty days without ceasing.
**16** But the king, greatly and continually filled with joy, setting up banquets before all the idols, with a mind strayed far from the truth and with a profane mouth, praising those [idols] which are mute and not able to speak unto them, nor to avail [aught], whilst he himself did speak unseemly things against the Greatest God.
**17** But after the aforementioned interval of time, the scribes reported unto the king, that they were no longer able to make the registration of the Jews,
**18** by reason of their immeasurable multitude; for though there were yet more in the country, some remaining gathered in their houses, and others also in the [appointed] place, [yet the task] was made impossible for all the generals throughout Egypt.
**19** But when he had threatened them more harshly, as though they had been bribed for a single device of escape, it came to pass that he was clearly convinced thereof,
**20** they saying with proof that both the...
