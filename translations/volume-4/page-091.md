51 ἐπὶ τῆς λυχνίας, καὶ ἐφαίνοσαν ἐν τῷ ναῷ. Καὶ ἐπέθηκαν ἐπὶ
τὴν τράπεζαν ἄρτους, καὶ ἐξεπέτασαν τὰ καταπετάσματα· καὶ
52 ἐτέλεσαν πάντα τὰ ἔργα ἃ ἐποίησαν. Καὶ ὤρθρισαν τὸ πρωΐ τῇ
πέμπτῃ καὶ εἰκάδι τοῦ μηνὸς τοῦ ἐνάτου· οὗτος ὁ μὴν Χασελεῦ
53 τοῦ ὀγδόου καὶ τεσσαρακοστοῦ καὶ ἑκατοστοῦ ἔτους. Καὶ ἀνή-
νεγκαν θυσίαν κατὰ τὸν νόμον ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον τῶν ὁλοκαυ-
54 τωμάτων τὸ καινὸν ὃ ἐποίησαν. Κατὰ τὸν καιρὸν καὶ κατὰ τὴν
ἡμέραν ἐν ᾗ ἐβεβήλωσαν αὐτὸ τὰ ἔθνη, ἐν ἐκείνῃ ἐνεκαινίσθη ἐν
55 ᾠδαῖς καὶ κιθάραις καὶ κινύραις καὶ ἐν κυμβάλοις. Καὶ ἔπεσον
πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ἐπὶ πρόσωπον, καὶ προσεκύνησαν καὶ ηὐλόγησαν εἰς
56 οὐρανὸν τὸν εὐοδώσαντα αὐτοῖς. Καὶ ἐποίησαν τὸν ἐγκαινισμὸν
τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου ἡμέρας ὀκτώ, καὶ προσήνεγκαν ὁλοκαυτώματα
57 μετ᾽ εὐφροσύνης, καὶ ἔθυσαν θυσίαν σωτηρίου καὶ αἰνέσεως. Καὶ
κατεκόσμησαν τὸ κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ λαοῦ στεφάνοις χρυσοῖς
καὶ ἀσπιδίσκαις, καὶ ἐνεκαινίσαν τὰς πύλας καὶ τὰ παστοφόρια,
58 καὶ ἐθύρωσαν αὐτά. Καὶ ἐγενήθη εὐφροσύνη μεγάλη ἐν τῷ λαῷ
59 σφόδρα, καὶ ἀπεστράφη ὄνειδος ἐθνῶν. Καὶ ἔστησεν Ἰούδας καὶ
οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ πᾶσα ἐκκλησία Ἰσραήλ, ἵνα ἄγωνται αἱ
ἡμέραι ἐγκαινισμοῦ τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου ἐν τοῖς καιροῖς αὐτῶν ἐ-
νιαυτὸν κατ᾽ ἐνιαυτόν ἡμέρας ὀκτώ, ἀπὸ τῆς πέμπτης καὶ εἰκά-
60 δος τοῦ μηνὸς Χασελεῦ μετ᾽ εὐφροσύνης καὶ χαρᾶς. Καὶ ᾠκο-
δόμησαν ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ τὸ ὄρος Σιών, κυκλόθεν τείχη ὑψηλὰ
καὶ πύργους ὀχυρούς, μὴ ποτε παραγενηθέντα τὰ ἔθνη κατα-
61 πατήσωσιν αὐτά, ὡς ἐποίησαν τὸ πρότερον. Καὶ ἀπέταξαν ἐκεῖ
δύναμιν τηρεῖν αὐτό, καὶ ὠχύρωσαν αὐτὸ τηρεῖν τὴν Βαιθσούρα,
τοῦ ἔχειν τὸν λαὸν ὀχύρωμα κατὰ πρόσωπον τῆς Ἰδουμαίας.

ΚΕΦ. Ε΄.

1 ΚΑὶ ἐγένετο, ὅτε ἤκουσαν τὰ ἔθνη κυκλόθεν, ὅτι ᾠκοδομήθη
τὸ θυσιαστήριον, καὶ ἐνεκαινίσθη τὸ ἁγίασμα ὡς τὸ πρότερον, καὶ
2 ὠργίσθησαν σφόδρα. Καὶ ἐβουλεύσαντο τοῦ ἆραι τὸ γένος Ἰακὼβ
τοὺς ὄντας ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἤρξαντο τοῦ θανατοῦν ἐν τῷ λαῷ
3 καὶ ἐξαίρειν. Καὶ ἐπολέμει Ἰούδας πρὸς τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἠσαῦ ἐν
τῇ Ἰδουμαίᾳ τὴν Ἀκραβαττίνην, ὅτι περικάθηντο τὸν Ἰσραήλ,
καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτοὺς πληγὴν μεγάλην, καὶ συνέστειλεν αὐτούς,

**51** [were] upon the lampstand; and they gave light in the Temple. And they placed loaves upon the table, and they spread forth the veils; and
**52** they completed all the works which they had wrought. And they rose up early in the morning on the five and twentieth day of the ninth month (which month is Chislev), in the one hundred and forty-eighth year.
**53** And they offered a sacrifice according to the Law upon the new Altar of burnt offerings, which they had made.
**54** At the selfsame time and on the selfsame day wherein the Gentiles had defiled it, even in that [day] was it rededicated with songs, and with lyres, and with harps, and with cymbals.
**55** And all the people fell upon their faces, and worshipped, and blessed Heaven, even Him who had made them to prosper.
**56** And they kept the dedication of the Altar for eight days, and offered burnt offerings with gladness, and sacrificed a sacrifice of well-being and of praise.
**57** And they embellished that which was before the face of the people with golden crowns and with decorative shields; and they rededicated the gates and the store-chambers, and put doors upon them.
**58** And there was exceeding great gladness among the people, and the reproach of the Gentiles was turned away.
**59** And Judas and his brethren, and all the congregation of Israel, ordained that the days of the dedication of the Altar should be kept in their season, from year to year, for eight days, from the five and twentieth day of the month Chislev, with gladness and with joy.
**60** And at that time they built up Mount Zion, with high walls round about, and strong towers, lest peradventure the Gentiles should come again and tread them down, as they had done aforetime.
**61** And they stationed there a garrison to keep it; and they fortified it [for the] keeping of Beth-zur, that the people might have a stronghold against Idumea.

### CHAPTER V

**1** Now it came to pass, when the nations round about heard that the altar was built, and the sanctuary rededicated as in former times, they were exceeding wroth.
**2** And they took counsel to destroy the race of Jacob that was among them, and began to slay among the people and to carry them away.
**3** Then Judas fought against the sons of Esau in Idumea, even in Akrabattene, because they besieged Israel; and he smote them with a great slaughter, and brought them low.
