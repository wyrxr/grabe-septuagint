καὶ ἔλαβε τὰ σκῦλα αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐμνήσθη τῆς κακίας υἱῶν Βαιάν, 4
οἳ ἦσαν τῷ λαῷ εἰς παγῖδα καὶ εἰς σκάνδαλον ἐν τῷ ἐνεδρεύειν
αὐτοὺς ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς. Καὶ συνεκλείσθησαν ὑπ᾿ αὐτοῦ εἰς τοὺς 5
πύργους, καὶ παρενέβαλεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς, καὶ ἀνεθεμάτισεν αὐτοὺς,
καὶ ἐνεπύρισε τοὺς πύργους αὐτῆς ἐν πυρὶ σὺν πᾶσι τοῖς ἐνοῦ- 6
σι. Καὶ διεπέρασεν ἐπὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἄμμων, καὶ εὗρε χεῖρα κρα-
ταιὰν καὶ λαὸν πολὺν, καὶ Τιμόθεον ἡγούμενον αὐτῶν. Καὶ συ- 7
νῆψε πρὸς αὐτοὺς πολέμους πολλοὺς, καὶ συνετερίβησαν πρὸ προ-
σώπου αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτοὺς. Καὶ προκατέλαβε τὴν Ἰαζὴρ, 8
καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας αὐτῆς, καὶ ἀνέστρεψεν εἰς τὴν Ἰουδαίαν. Καὶ 9
ἐπισυνήχθησαν τὰ ἔθνη τὰ ἐν τῇ Γαλααδίτι ἐπὶ τὸν Ἰσραὴλ
τοὺς ὄντας ἐπὶ τοῖς ὁρίοις αὐτῶν τοῦ ἐξᾶραι αὐτοὺς˙ καὶ ἔφυ-
γον εἰς Δάθεμα τὸ ὀχύρωμα. Καὶ ἀπέστειλαν γράμματα πρὸς 10
Ἰούδαν καὶ τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ, λέγοντες˙ ἐπισυνηγμένα ἐστιν
ἐφ᾿ ἡμᾶς τὰ ἔθνη τὰ κύκλῳ ἡμῶν τοῦ ἐξᾶραι ἡμᾶς, καὶ ἑτοιμά-
ζονται ἐλθεῖν καὶ προκαταλαβέσθαι τὸ ὀχύρωμα, εἰς ὃ κατεφύ- 11
γομεν, καὶ Τιμόθεος ἡγεῖται τῆς παρεμβολῆς αὐτῶν. Νῦν οὖν 12
ἐλθὼν ἐξελοῦ ἡμᾶς ἐκ χειρὸς αὐτῶν, ὅτι πέπτωκεν ἐξ ἡμῶν πλῆ-
θος. Καὶ πάντες οἱ ἀδελφοὶ ἡμῶν οἱ ὄντες ἐν τοῖς Τουβίου τεθα- 13
νάτωνται, καὶ ᾐχμαλώτικασι τὰς γυναῖκας αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ τέκνα
αὐτῶν καὶ τὴν ἀποσκευὴν, καὶ ἀπώλεσαν ἐκεῖ ὡς μίαν χιλιαρ- 14
χίαν ἀνδρῶν. Ἔτι αἱ ἐπιστολαὶ ἀνεγινώσκοντο, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἄγγελοι
ἕτεροι παρεγένοντο ἐκ τῆς Γαλιλαίας διεῤῥηχότες τὰ ἱμάτια, ἀ- 15
παγγέλλοντες κατὰ τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα, λέγοντες˙ ἐπισυνῆχθαι ἐπ᾿
αὐτοὺς ἐκ Πτολεμαΐδος καὶ Τύρου καὶ Σιδῶνος καὶ πάσης Γα-
λιλαίας ἀλλοφύλων, τοῦ ἐξαναλῶσαι ἡμᾶς. Ὡς δὲ ἤκουσεν Ἰού- 16
δας καὶ ὁ λαὸς τοὺς λόγους τούτους, ἐπισυνήχθη ἐκκλησία με-
γάλη βουλεύεσθαι τί ποιήσωσι τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς αὐτῶν τοῖς οὖσιν ἐν
θλίψει καὶ πολεμουμένοις ὑπ᾿ αὐτῶν. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰούδας Σίμωνι 17
τῷ ἀδελφῷ αὐτοῦ˙ ἐπίλεξον σεαυτῷ ἄνδρας, καὶ πορεύου, καὶ ῥῦσαι
τοὺς ἀδελφούς σου τοὺς ἐν τῇ Γαλιλαίᾳ˙ ἐγὼ δὲ καὶ Ἰωνάθαν ὁ
ἀδελφός μου πορευσόμεθα εἰς τὴν Γαλααδῖτιν. Καὶ κατέλιπεν 18
Ἰώσηφον τὸν τοῦ Ζαχαρίου καὶ Ἀζαρίαν ἡγουμένους τοῦ λαοῦ με-
τὰ τῶν ἐπιλοίπων τῆς δυνάμεως ἐν τῇ Ἰουδαίᾳ εἰς τήρησιν. Καὶ 19
ἐνετείλατο αὐτοῖς, λέγων˙ πρόσητε τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου, καὶ μὴ συνάψητε πόλεμον πρὸς τὰ ἔθνη ἕως τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι ἡμᾶς. Καὶ ἐμε- 20
