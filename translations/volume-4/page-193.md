    **1** ΦΙΛΟΣΟΦΩΤΑΤΟΝ λόγον ἐπιδείκνυσθαι μέλλων, εἰ αὐτοδέσποτός ἐστι τῶν παθῶν ὁ εὐσεβὴς λογισμὸς˙ συμβουλεύσαιμ’ ἂν ὑμῖν
    **2** ὀρθῶς, ὅπως προθύμως προσέχητε τῇ φιλοσοφίᾳ. Καὶ γὰρ ἀναγκαῖος εἰς ἐπιστήμην παντὶ ὁ λόγος , καὶ ἄλλως τῆς μεγίστης ἀρετῆς.
    **3** λέγω δὴ φρονήσεως, περιέχει ἔπαινον˙ εἰ ἄρα τῶν σωφροσύνης κωλυτικῶν παθῶν ὁ λογισμὸς φαίνεται ἐπικρατεῖν, γαστριμαργίας τε καὶ ἐπιθυμίας˙
    **4** ἀλλὰ καὶ τῶν τῆς δικαιοσύνης ἐμποδιστικῶν παθῶν κυριεύειν ἀναφαίνεται, οἷον κακοηθείας˙ καὶ τῶν τῆς ἀνδρείας ἐμποδιστικῶν παθῶν, θυμοῦ τε, καὶ πόνου καὶ φόβου.
    **5** Πῶς οὖν, ἴσως εἴποιεν ἄν τινες, εἰ τῶν παθῶν ὁ λογισμὸς κρατεῖ, λήθης καὶ ἀγνοίας οὐ δεσπόζει ; γελοῖον ἐπιχειροῦντες λέγειν˙
    **6** Οὐ γὰρ τῶν ἑαυτοῦ παθῶν ὁ λογισμὸς κρατεῖ, ἀλλὰ τῶν τῆς δικαιοσύνης καὶ ἀνδρείας καὶ σωφροσύνης, καὶ φρονήσεως ἐναντίων˙ καὶ τούτων, οὐχ ὥστε αὐτὰ καταλῦσαι, ἀλλ’
    **7** ὥστε αὐτοῖς μὴ εἶξαι. Πολλαχόθεν μὲν οὖν καὶ ἀλλαχόθεν ἔχοιμ’ ἂν ὑμῖν ἐπιδεῖξαι, ὅτι αὐτοκράτωρ ἐστὶ τῶν παθῶν ὁ εὐσεβὴς
    **8** λογισμός. Πολὺ δὲ πλέον τοῦτο ἀποδείξαιμι ἀπὸ τῆς ἀνδραγαθίας τῶν ὑπὲρ ἀρετῆς ἀποθανόντων, Ἐλεαζάρου τε καὶ ἑπτὰ
    **9** ἀδελφῶν καὶ τῆς τούτων μητρός. Ἄπαντες γὰρ οὗτοι τῶν ὑπὲρ τῶν Θεοῦ νόμων ἕως θανάτου πόνων ὑπεριδόντες , καὶ ὑπὲρ θεοσεβείας τὸ ζῆν αὑτῶν ὑπεριδόντες, ἐπεδείξαντο ὅτι πε-

    **THE FOURTH BOOK OF MACCABEES.**
    **CHAPTER I.**

    **1** Being about to set forth a most philosophical discourse, even whether pious reason be absolute master over the passions, I would counsel you
    **2** aright, that ye may diligently attend unto philosophy. For this discourse is needful unto all men for [the attainment of] knowledge, and besides this, for the greatest virtue;
    **3** I speak indeed of prudence, [and] it doth comprehend praise. If, therefore, reason be seen to overcome the passions which hinder temperance, [even] gluttony
    **4** and desire, but also is it seen to master the passions which impede righteousness, such as malice; and the passions which impede fortitude, even wrath, and pain, and fear.
    **5** How then, perhaps some might say, if reason doth govern the passions, doth it not also rule over forgetfulness and ignorance? [Thus] attempting to speak a ridiculous thing.
    **6** For reason doth not govern its own passions, but those that are contrary to righteousness, and fortitude, and temperance, and prudence; and these it doth not destroy,
    **7** but that it may not yield unto them. From many and diverse places, indeed, could I show unto you that pious reason is absolute master over the passions.
    **8** But far more would I demonstrate this from the valiant deeds of them that died for virtue's sake, even Eleazar and the seven
    **9** brethren and their mother. For all these, having disdained the torments endured even unto death for the laws of God, and having scorned their very lives for godliness' sake, did demonstrate that reason doth
    **10** overcome the passions. Now for their virtues' sake, it is for me to praise these men who died with their mother in this season for goodness and nobility; and for their honours
    **11** I would pronounce them blessed. For those men, having been admired not only by all men for their fortitude and endurance, but also by those who tortured them, did become the cause of the overthrow of the
