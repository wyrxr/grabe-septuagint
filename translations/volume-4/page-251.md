**2.** λαόν σου (οἷς) εἰς ἐπιθυμίαν ὀρέξεως ξένην γεῦσιν, τροφὴν ἠτίμασας ὀρυγομήτραν·
**3.** ἵνα ἐκεῖνοι μὲν ἐπιθυμοῦντες τροφήν, διὰ τὴν εἰδέχεῖαν τῶν ἐπαπεσταλμένων καὶ τὴν ἀναγκαίαν ὄρεξιν ἀποστρέφωνται,
**4.** οὗτοι δὲ ἐπ᾿ ὀλίγον ἐνδεεῖς γενόμενοι, καὶ ξένης μετάσχωσι γεύσεως. Ἔδει γὰρ ἐκείνοις μὲν ἀπαραίτητον ἔνδειαν ἐπελθεῖν τυραννοῦσι, τούτοις δὲ μόνον δειχθῆναι πῶς οἱ ἐχθροὶ αὐτῶν ἐβασανίζοντο.
**5.** Καὶ γὰρ ὅτε αὐτοῖς δεινὸς ἐπῆλθε θηρίων θυμός, δήγμασί τε σκολιῶν διεφθείροντο ὄφεων, οὐ μέχρι τέλους ἔμεινεν ἡ ὀργή σου·
**6.** εἰς νουθεσίαν δὲ πρὸς ὀλίγον ἐταράχθησαν, σύμβολον ἔχοντες σωτηρίας, εἰς ἀνάμνησιν ἐντολῆς νόμου σου·
**7.** ὁ γὰρ ἐπιστραφεὶς οὐ διὰ τὸ θεωρούμενον ἐσώζετο,
**8.** ἀλλὰ διὰ σὲ τὸν πάντων σωτῆρα.
**9.** Καὶ ἐν τούτῳ δὲ ἔπεισας τοὺς ἐχθροὺς ἡμῶν, ὅτι σὺ εἶ ὁ ῥυόμενος ἐκ παντὸς κακοῦ· οὓς μὲν γὰρ ἀκρίδων καὶ μυιῶν ἀπέκτεινε δείγματα, καὶ οὐχ εὑρέθη ἴαμα τῇ ψυχῇ αὐτῶν,
**10.** ἔτι ἄξιοι ἦσαν ὑπὸ τοιούτων κολασθῆναι· Τοὺς δὲ υἱούς σου οὐδὲ ἰοβόλων δρακόντων ἐνίκησαν ὀδόντες·
**11.** τὸ ἔλεος γάρ σου ἀντιπαρῆλθε, καὶ ἰάσατο αὐτούς. Εἰς γὰρ ὑπόμνησιν τῶν λογίων σου ἐνεκεντρίζοντο, καὶ ἐξέως διεσώζοντο, ἵνα μὴ εἰς βαθεῖαν ἐμπεσόντες λήθην, ἀπερίσπαστοι γένωνται τῆς σῆς
**12.** εὐεργεσίας. Καὶ γὰρ οὔτε βοτάνη οὔτε μάλαγμα ἐθεράπευσεν αὐτούς,
**13.** ἀλλὰ ὁ σὸς Κύριε λόγος ὁ πάντα ἰώμενος. Σὺ γὰρ ζωῆς καὶ θανάτου ἐξουσίαν ἔχεις, καὶ κατάγεις εἰς πύλας ᾅδου,
**14.** καὶ ἀνάγεις. Ἄνθρωπος δὲ ἀποκτείνει μὲν τῇ κακίᾳ αὐτοῦ· ἐξελθὸν δὲ πνεῦμα οὐκ ἀναστρέφει, οὐδὲ ἀναλύει ψυχὴν παραληφθεῖσαν.
**15.16** Τὴν δὲ σὴν χεῖρα φυγῖν ἀδύνατόν ἐστιν· ἀρνούμενοι γάρ σε εἰδέναι ἀσεβεῖς, ἐν ἰσχύϊ βραχίονός σου ἐμαστιγώθησαν, ξένοις ὕετοις καὶ χαλάζαις καὶ ὄμβροις διωκόμενοι ἀπαραιτήτοις, καὶ πυρὶ
**17.** καταναλισκόμενοι. Τὸ γὰρ παραδοξότατον, ἐν τῷ πάντα σβεννύντι ὕδατι πλεῖον ἐνήργει τὸ πῦρ· (ὑπέρμαχος γὰρ ὁ κόσμος ἐστι δικαίων)·
**18.** ποτὲ μὲν γὰρ ἡμεροῦτο φλόξ, ἵνα μὴ καταφλέξῃ τὰ ἐπ᾿ ἀσεβεῖς ἀπεσταλμένα ζῶα, ἀλλὰ αὐτοὶ βλέποντες ἴδωσιν, ὅτι Θεοῦ κρίσει
**19.** ἐλαύνονται· ποτὲ δὲ καὶ μεταξὺ ὕδατος ὑπὲρ τὴν πυρὸς δύναμιν φλέγει, ἵνα ἀδίκου γῆς γεννήματα καταφθείρῃ.
**20.** Ἀνθ᾿ ὧν ἀγγέλων τροφὴν ἐξώμισας τὸν λαόν σου, καὶ ἕτοιμον ἄρτον ἀπ᾿ οὐρανοῦ παρέσχες αὐτοῖς ἀκοπιάστως, πᾶσαν ἡδονὴν ἴσχοντα καὶ πρὸς πᾶσαν ἁρμόνιον γεῦσιν.
**21.** Ἡ μὲν γὰρ ἀπόστασίς σου

**CHAPTER XVI.**

**2** ...[Thou didst bless Thy] people, (to whom) for a desire of appetite a strange taste, and didst dishonor the food of the locusts;
**3** that those, desiring food, might turn away because of the repulsiveness of the [plague] sent unto them and [even from] their necessary appetite,
**4** but these, having become needy for a little while, might also partake of a strange taste. For it was meet for those, being tyrants, to be overtaken by unavoidable destitution; but for these, only to be shown how their enemies were tormented.
**5** For when a terrible fury of beasts came upon them, and they were destroyed by the bites of crooked serpents, Thy wrath remained not unto the end;
**6** but for a little while were they troubled for admonition, having a symbol of salvation, for a remembrance of the commandment of Thy law.
**7** For he who turned was saved not by that which was seen,
**8** but by Thee, the Savior of all.
**9** And by this didst Thou persuade our enemies, that Thou art He who delivereth from every evil. For those whom the stings of locusts and flies did kill, and no healing was found for their soul,
**10** were yet worthy to be punished by such things. But Thy sons did not the teeth even of venomous dragons overcome;
**11** for Thy mercy passed over [them], and healed them. For unto a remembrance of Thy words were they stung, and quickly were they preserved, lest, having fallen into deep forgetfulness, they should be drawn away from Thy beneficence.
**12** For neither herb nor poultice did heal them,
**13** but Thy word, O Lord, which healeth all things. For Thou hast power of life and death, and Thou leadest down to the gates of Hades,
**14** and Thou bringest up. But man indeed doth slay by his wickedness; yet a spirit, having departed, doth not return, nor doth it release a soul that hath been taken.
**15** But to flee Thy hand is impossible;
**16** for the impious, denying to know Thee, were scourged by the strength of Thine arm, being pursued by strange rains and hailstones and irresistible storms, and consumed by fire.
**17** For, most paradoxical, in the water which doth extinguish all things, the fire did work more powerfully; (for the world is a champion for the righteous).
**18** For sometimes was the flame made mild, that it might not burn up the living creatures sent against the impious, but that they themselves, beholding, might perceive that by God's judgment they are driven.
**19** But sometimes also, amidst the water, it doth burn with power beyond [that of] fire, that it might destroy the offspring of the unrighteous earth.
**20** Instead of which [punishments], Thou didst lay bare the shoulders of Thy people [with] the food of angels, and didst provide them ready bread from heaven without toil, having every pleasure and suitable for every taste.
**21** For indeed Thy departure [from them...]
