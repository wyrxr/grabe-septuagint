ΣΟΦΙΑ ΙΗΣΟΥ ΣΙΡΑΧ 1789

ΚΕΦΑΛΑΙΟΝ Α΄.
1 ΠΑΣΑ σοφία παρὰ Κυρίου, καὶ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἐστιν εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα.
2 Ἄμμον θαλασσῶν καὶ σταγόνας ὑετοῦ καὶ ἡμέρας αἰῶνος τίς ἐξαριθμήσει;
3 Ὕψος οὐρανοῦ καὶ πλάτος γῆς καὶ ἀβύσσου καὶ σοφίαν τίς ἐξιχνιάσει;
4 Προτέρα πάντων ἔκτισται σοφία, καὶ σύνεσις φρονήσεως ἐξ αἰῶνος.
5 Πηγὴ σοφίας λόγος Θεοῦ ἐν ὑψίστοις, καὶ αἱ πορεῖαι αὐτῆς ἐντολαὶ αἰώνιοι.
6 Ῥίζα σοφίας τίνι ἀπεκαλύφθη; καὶ τὰ πανουργήματα αὐτῆς τίς ἔγνω;
7 Ἐπιστήμη σοφίας τίνι ἐφανερώθη; καὶ τὴν πολυπειρίαν αὐτῆς τίς συνῆκε;
8 Εἷς ἔστι σοφὸς φοβερὸς σφόδρα, καθήμενος ἐπὶ τοῦ θρόνου αὐτοῦ, Κύριος.
9 Αὐτὸς ἔκτισεν αὐτήν, καὶ ἰδε καὶ ἐξηρίθμησεν αὐτήν, καὶ
10 ἐξέχεεν αὐτὴν ἐπὶ πάντα τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ· μετὰ πάσης σαρκὸς κατὰ τὴν δόσιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐχορήγησεν αὐτὴν τοῖς ἀγαπῶσιν αὐτόν.
11 Φόβος Κυρίου δόξα καὶ καύχημα, καὶ εὐφροσύνη καὶ στέφανος ἀγαλλιάματος·
12 φόβος Κυρίου τέρψει καρδίαν, καὶ δώσει εὐφροσύνην καὶ χαρὰν καὶ μακροημέρευσιν.
13 Τῷ φοβουμένῳ τὸν Κύριον εὖ ἔσται ἐπ᾿ ἐσχάτων, καὶ ἐν ἡμέρᾳ τελευτῆς αὐτοῦ εὐλογηθήσεται.
14 Φόβος Κυρίου δόσις παρὰ Κυρίου, καὶ ἐπ᾿ ἀγαπήσεως τρίβους καθίστησι.
15 Ἀγάπησις Κυρίου ἔνδοξος σοφία· οἷς δ᾿ ὀπτάνηται μερίζει αὐτὴν εἰς ὅρασιν αὐτοῦ. Ἀρχὴ σοφίας φοβεῖσθαι τὸν Κύριον,
16 καὶ μετὰ πιστῶν ἐν μήτρᾳ συνεκτίσθη αὐτοῖς· μετὰ ἀνθρώπων θεμέλιον αἰῶνος ἐνόσσευσε, καὶ μετὰ τοῦ σπέρματος αὐτῶν ἐμπιστευθήσεται.
16 Πλησμονὴ σοφίας φοβεῖσθαι τὸν Κύριον, καὶ μεθύσκει αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ τῶν καρπῶν αὐτῆς· πάντα τὸν οἶκον αὐτῶν ἐμπλήσει ἐπιθυμημάτων, καὶ τὰ ἀποδοχεῖα αὐτῶν γεννημάτων αὐτῆς.
17 Στέφανος σοφίας φόβος Κυρίου, ἀναβάλλων εἰρήνην καὶ ὑγίειαν ἰάσεως· ἀμφότερα δέ ἐστι δῶρα Θεοῦ, πλατύνει δὲ καύχησιν τοῖς ἀγαπῶσιν αὐτόν. Καὶ ἰδε καὶ ἐξηρίθμησεν αὐτήν, ἐπιστήμην καὶ γνῶσιν συνέσεως ἐξώμβρησε, καὶ δόξαν κρατούντων αὐτῆς ἀνύψωσε.
18 Ῥίζα σοφίας φοβεῖσθαι τὸν Κύριον, καὶ οἱ κλάδοι αὐτῆς μακροημέρευσις.
20 Φόβος Κυρίου ἀπωλεῖται ἁμαρτήματα· ἄφοβος δὲ οὐ δυνήσεται δικαιωθῆναι.
21 Οὐ δυνήσεται θυμὸς ἄδικος δικαιωθῆναι· ἦ γὰρ ῥοπὴ τοῦ θυμοῦ αὐτοῦ πτῶσις αὐτῷ.
22 Ἕως καιροῦ ἀνθέξεται μακρόθυμος, καὶ ὕστερον αὐτῷ ἀναδώσει εὐφροσύνην·
23 ἕως καιροῦ

**The Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach**

**Chapter One**

1 All wisdom cometh from the Lord, and with Him it abideth for ever.
2 Who can number the sand of the sea, and the drops of rain, and the days of eternity?
3 The height of heaven, and the breadth of the earth, and the depth of the abyss, and wisdom, who can search them out?
4 Wisdom hath been created before all things, and the understanding of prudence from everlasting.
5 The fountain of wisdom is the Word of God in the highest, and her paths are the eternal commandments.
6 To whom hath the root of wisdom been revealed? And who hath known her subtle workings?
7 To whom hath the knowledge of wisdom been made manifest? And who hath understood her manifold experience?

8 One there is that is wise, and greatly to be feared, who sitteth upon His throne: the Lord.
9 He Himself created her, and behold, and numbered her,
10 and poured her out upon all His works; with all flesh, according to His own gift, and He bestowed her upon them that love Him.

11 The fear of the Lord is glory and a boast, and gladness and a crown of exultation.
12 The fear of the Lord delighteth the heart, and shall give gladness, and joy, and length of days.
13 To him that feareth the Lord, it shall be well in the last days, and in the day of his death shall he be blessed.
14 The fear of the Lord is a gift from the Lord, and it setteth paths of love.
15 The love of the Lord is glorious wisdom; and to whomsoever she appeareth, she imparteth herself into his vision. The beginning of wisdom is to fear the Lord,
16 and with the faithful, in the womb, was she co-created for them; with men she hath nested an eternal foundation, and with their seed shall she be entrusted.
17 The fullness of wisdom is to fear the Lord, and she maketh them drunken with her fruits; she shall fill all their house with delights, and their storehouses with her increase.
18 The crown of wisdom is the fear of the Lord, which bringeth forth peace and soundness of healing;
19 and both these are gifts of God; and He extendeth glory unto them that love Him. And behold, He numbered her; He hath poured forth knowledge and the understanding of prudence, and He hath exalted the glory of them that lay hold upon her.
20 The root of wisdom is to fear the Lord, and her branches are length of days.
21 The fear of the Lord taketh away sins; but he that is without fear shall not be able to be justified.
22 Unjust wrath shall not be able to be justified; for the inclination of his wrath is his downfall.
23 For a season shall the long-suffering man endure, and afterward shall He give him gladness;
24 For a season
