5 σαρκός. Ἤκουτισεν αὐτὸν τῆς φωνῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἰσήγαγεν αὐτὸν εἰς τὸν γνόφον, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ κατὰ πρόσωπον ἐντολὰς, νόμον ζωῆς καὶ ἐπιστήμης, διδάξαι τὸν Ἰακὼβ διαθήκην, καὶ κρίματα αὐτοῦ τὸν Ἰσραήλ.
6 Ἀαρὼν ὕψωσεν ἅγιον ὅμοιον αὐτῷ,
7 ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ ἐκ φυλῆς Λευί· ἔστησεν αὐτῷ διαθήκην αἰῶνος, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ ἱερατείαν λαοῦ· ἐμακάρισεν αὐτὸν ἐν εὐκοσμίᾳ,
8 καὶ περιέζωσεν αὐτὸν περιστολὴν δόξης· ἐνέδυσεν αὐτὸν συντέλειαν καυχήματος, καὶ ἐστερέωσεν αὐτὸν σκεύεσιν ἰσχύος, περισκελῆ καὶ ποδήρη καὶ ἐπωμίδα·
9 καὶ ἐκύκλωσεν αὐτὸν ῥοΐσκοις χρυσοῖς, κώδωσι πλείστοις κυκλόθεν, ἠχῆσαι φωνὴν ἐν βήμασιν αὐτοῦ, ἀκουστὸν ποιῆσαι ἦχον ἐν ναῷ εἰς μνημόσυνον υἱοῖς λαοῦ
10 αὐτοῦ· στολὴ ἁγία, χρυσῷ καὶ ὑακίνθῳ καὶ πορφύρᾳ, ἔργῳ ποικιλτοῦ,
11 λογείῳ κρίσεως δήλοις ἀληθείας, κεκλωσμένη κόκκῳ, ἔργῳ τεχνίτου, λίθοις πολυτελέσι γλύμματος σφραγῖδος, ἐν δέσει χρυσίου, φυλῶν Ἰσραήλ·
12 στέφανον χρυσοῦν ἐπάνω κιδάρεως, ἐκτύπωμα σφραγῖδος ἁγιάσματος, καύχημα τιμῆς, ἔργον ἰσχύος, ἐπιθυμήματα ὀφθαλμῶν κοσμούμενα ὡραῖα·
13 πρὸ αὐτοῦ οὐ γέγονε τοιαῦτα, ἕως αἰῶνος οὐκ ἐνεδύσατο ἀλλογενὴς πλὴν τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ μόνον, καὶ τὰ ἔκγονα αὐτοῦ διαπαντός!
14 Θυσίαι αὐτοῦ ὁλοκαρπωθήσονται καθημέραν ἐνδελεχῶς εἰς.
15 Ἐπλήρωσε Μωσῆς τὰς χεῖρας, καὶ ἔχρισεν αὐτὸν ἐν ἐλαίῳ ἁγίῳ· ἐγενήθη αὐτῷ εἰς διαθήκην αἰώνιον, καὶ τῷ σπέρματι αὐτοῦ ἐν ἡμέραις οὐρανοῦ, λειτουργεῖν αὐτῷ ἅμα καὶ ἱερατεύειν, καὶ εὐλογεῖν τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι αὐτοῦ.
16 Ἐξελέξατο αὐτὸν ἀπὸ παντὸς ζῶντος, προσαγαγεῖν κάρπωσιν Κυρίῳ, θυμίαμα καὶ εὐωδίαν εἰς μνημόσυνον, ἐξιλάσκεσθαι περὶ τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ.
17 Ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ ἐν ταῖς ἐντολαῖς αὐτοῦ, ἐξουσίαν ἐν διαθήκαις κριμάτων, διδάξαι τὸν Ἰακὼβ τὰ μαρτύρια, καὶ ἐν νόμῳ αὐτοῦ φωτίσαι τὸν Ἰσραήλ.
18 Ἐπισυνέστησαν αὐτῷ ἀλλότριοι, καὶ ἐζήλωσαν αὐτὸν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ ἄνδρες οἱ περὶ Δαθὰν καὶ Ἀβειρών, καὶ ἡ συναγωγὴ Κορὲ ἐν θυμῷ καὶ ὀργῇ.
19 Ἴδε Κύριος καὶ οὐκ ηὐδόκησε, καὶ συνετελέσθησαν ἐν θυμῷ ὀργῆς· ἐποίησεν αὐτοῖς τέρατα, καταναλῶσαι ἐν πυρὶ φλογὸς αὐτούς.
20 Καὶ προσέθηκεν Ἀαρὼν δόξαν, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ κληρονομίαν· ἀπαρχὰς πρωτογενημάτων ἐμέρισεν αὐτῷ, ἄρτον ἐν πρώτοις ἡτοίμασεν ἐν πλησμονῇ·
21 καὶ γὰρ θυσίας Κυρίου φάγονται, ἃς ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ τε καὶ

**The Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach**

**Chapter Forty-Five**

5 ...[and chose him] out of all flesh. He made him to hear His voice,
And brought him into the thick darkness;
And gave unto him, face to face, commandments,
A law of life and of knowledge,
To teach Jacob the covenant,
And His judgments to Israel.
6 He exalted Aaron, a holy one like unto him,
7 His brother from the tribe of Levi.
He established for him an everlasting covenant,
And gave unto him the priesthood of the people.
He blessed him in comeliness,
8 And girded him with a robe of glory.
He clothed him with the consummation of [his] adornment,
And strengthened him with instruments of power:
The breeches, and the long robe, and the ephod.
9 And He encompassed him with golden pomegranates,
With many bells round about,
That a sound might resound in his steps,
To make his sound audible in the Sanctuary,
For a memorial to the sons of his people.
10 [His was] a holy vestment, with gold and hyacinth-blue and purple,
The work of an embroiderer;
11 The breastplate of judgment, by manifest truths,
Woven with scarlet, the work of a craftsman,
With precious stones, the engraving of a seal,
Set in gold, for the tribes of Israel.
12 A golden crown upon the mitre,
The engraving of a seal of holiness,
An adornment of honour, a work of power,
Desirable things for the eyes, beautifully adorned.
13 Before him there were no such things;
Unto the age no stranger put them on,
Save only his sons, and his offspring continually!
14 His sacrifices shall be wholly offered daily, continually, unto.
15 Moses filled his hands, and anointed him with holy oil.
It became for him an everlasting covenant,
And for his seed, in the days of heaven,
To minister to Him, both to act as priest,
And to bless His people in His Name.
16 He chose him from every living being,
To bring an offering unto the Lord,
Incense and a sweet savour for a memorial,
To make propitiation for his people.
17 He gave unto him, in His commandments,
Authority in the covenants of judgments,
To teach Jacob the testimonies,
And by His law to enlighten Israel.
18 Strangers gathered themselves against him,
And envied him in the wilderness,
[Even] the men about Dathan and Abiram,
And the congregation of Korah, in wrath and anger.
19 The Lord saw, and was not pleased;
And they were consumed in the wrath of His anger.
He wrought wonders against them,
To consume them with a flaming fire.
20 And He added glory to Aaron,
And gave unto him an inheritance.
He apportioned unto him the first-fruits of the first-born;
He prepared bread in abundance as [chief of the] first-fruits;
21 For indeed, the sacrifices of the Lord shall they eat,
Which He gave unto him and [to his seed].
