**6** Ἰσραήλ. Ἐπράθητε τοῖς ἔθνεσιν οὐκ εἰς ἀπώλειαν, διὰ δὲ τὸ παροργίσαι
**7** ὑμᾶς τὸν Θεόν· παρεδόθητε τοῖς ὑπεναντίοις, παρωξύνατε γὰρ τὸν ποιήσαντα ὑμᾶς, θύσαντες δαιμονίοις, καὶ οὐ Θεῷ.
**8** Ἐπελάθεσθε δὲ τὸν τρέφοντα ὑμᾶς Θεὸν αἰώνιον, ἐλυπήσατε
**9** δὲ καὶ τὴν ἐκθρέψασαν ὑμᾶς Ἱερουσαλήμ. Ἴδε γὰρ τὴν ἐπελθοῦσαν ὑμῖν ὀργὴν παρὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ εἶπεν· ἀκούσατε αἱ πάροικοι Σιών, ἐπήγαγε γάρ μοι ὁ Θεὸς πένθος μέγα·
**10** ἴδον γὰρ τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν τοῦ λαοῦ τῶν υἱῶν μου καὶ τῶν θυγατέρων, ἣν
**11** ἐπήγαγεν αὐτοῖς ὁ αἰώνιος, ἔθρεψα γὰρ αὐτοὺς μετ᾽ εὐφροσύνης,
**12** ἐξαπέστειλα δὲ μετὰ κλαυθμοῦ καὶ πένθους. Μηδεὶς ἐπιχαιρέτω
**13** μοι τῇ χήρᾳ, καὶ καταλειφθείσῃ ὑπὸ πολλῶν, ἠρημώθην διὰ τὰς ἁμαρτίας τῶν τέκνων μου, διότι ἐξέκλιναν ἐκ νόμου Θεοῦ, δικαιώματα δὲ αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἔγνωσαν,
**14** οὐδὲ ἐπορεύθησαν ἐντολῶν Θεοῦ, οὐδὲ τρίβους παιδείας ἐν δικαιοσύνῃ αὐτοῦ ἐπέβησαν. Ἐλθάτωσαν αἱ πάροικοι Σιών, καὶ μνήσθητε τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν τῶν
**15** υἱῶν μου καὶ τῶν θυγατέρων, ἣν ἐπήγαγεν αὐτοῖς ὁ αἰώνιος· ἐπήγαγε γὰρ ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς ὁ Θεὸς ἔθνος μακρόθεν, ἔθνος ἀναιδὲς καὶ
**16** ἀλλόγλωσσον· οἳ οὐκ ἠσχύνθησαν πρεσβύτην οὐδὲ παιδίον ἠλέησαν, καὶ ἀπήγαγον τοὺς ἀγαπητοὺς τῆς χήρας, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν θυγατέρων τὴν μονογενῆ ἠρήμωσαν.
**17** Ἐγὼ δὲ τί δύναμαι βοηθῆσαι ὑμῖν ;
**18** Ὁ γὰρ ἐπαγαγὼν τὰ κακὰ ὑμῖν ἐξελεῖται ὑμᾶς ἐκ χειρὸς ἐχθρῶν ὑμῶν.
**19** Βαδίζετε, τέκνα, βαδίζετε, ἐγὼ γὰρ κατελείφθην ἔρημος,
**20** ἐξεδυσάμην τὴν στολὴν τῆς εἰρήνης, καὶ ἐνεδυσάμην σάκκον τῆς δεήσεώς μου· κεκράξομαι πρὸς τὸν αἰώνιον ὕψιστον ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις μου.
**21** Θαρσεῖτε, τέκνα, καὶ βοησάτε πρὸς τὸν Θεόν, καὶ
**22** ἐξελεῖται ὑμᾶς ἐκ δυναστείας, ἐκ χειρὸς ἐχθρῶν ὑμῶν. Ἐγὼ γὰρ ἐπὶ τῷ αἰωνίῳ ἤλπισα τὴν σωτηρίαν ὑμῶν· καὶ ἦλθέ μοι χαρὰ παρὰ τοῦ ἁγίου ἐπὶ τῇ ἐλεημοσύνῃ, ἣ ἥξει ὑμῖν ἐν τάχει παρὰ τοῦ αἰωνίου σωτῆρος ὑμῶν.
**23** Ἐξέπεμψα γὰρ ὑμᾶς μετὰ πένθους καὶ κλαυθμοῦ· ἀποδώσει δέ μοι ὁ Θεὸς ὑμᾶς μετὰ χαρμοσύνης καὶ εὐφροσύνης εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα.
**24** Ὥσπερ γὰρ νῦν ἑωράκασιν αἱ πάροικοι Σιὼν τὴν ἡμετέραν αἰχμαλωσίαν, οὕτως ὄψονται ἐν τάχει τὴν
**25** παρὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ ὑμῶν σωτηρίαν, ἣ ἐπελεύσεται ὑμῖν μετὰ δόξης μεγάλης καὶ λαμπρότητος τοῦ αἰωνίου. Τέκνα, μακροθυμήσατε τὴν παρὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐπελθοῦσαν ὑμῖν ὀργήν. Κατεδίωξε γάρ σε ὁ ἐχθρός σου, καὶ ἔβη αὐτοῦ τὴν ἀπώλειαν ἐν τάχει, καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς

**CHAPTER IV.**

**6** O Israel, ye were sold unto the nations, not for [your] utter destruction, but because ye provoked God to wrath;
**7** Ye were delivered unto your adversaries, for ye provoked Him that made you, sacrificing unto demons, and not unto God.
**8** For ye forgot the Everlasting God that nourished you; ye grieved also
**9** Jerusalem that nurtured you. For behold, the wrath of God that hath come upon you, and she said: "Hearken, O ye sojourners of Zion, for God hath brought upon me great mourning;
**10** For I have seen the captivity of my people, [even] of my sons and of my daughters, which
**11** the Everlasting hath brought upon them. For I nourished them with joy,
**12** but sent them forth with weeping and with mourning. Let no man rejoice over
**13** me, the widow, and [her that is] forsaken by many; I am made desolate because of the sins of my children, for they turned aside from the law of God, neither knew they His ordinances,
**14** Neither walked they in the commandments of God, nor trod they the paths of discipline in His righteousness. Let the sojourners of Zion come, and remember the captivity of
**15** my sons and of my daughters, which the Everlasting hath brought upon them; for God hath brought upon them a nation from afar, a nation shameless and
**16** of a strange tongue; who neither reverenced the elder nor pitied the child, and led away the beloved [ones] of the widow, and from among her daughters made desolate her only daughter.
**17** But what can I avail to help you?
**18** For He that brought these evils upon you shall deliver you from the hand of your enemies.
**19** Go your way, O my children, go your way, for I was left desolate,
**20** I have put off the garment of peace, and put on the sackcloth of my supplication; I will cry unto the Everlasting Most High in my days.
**21** Be of good courage, O my children, and cry out unto God, and
**22** He shall deliver you from [their] power, [even] from the hand of your enemies. For I have hoped in the Everlasting for your salvation; and joy is come unto me from the Holy One upon the mercy, which shall come unto you quickly from the Everlasting your Savior.
**23** For I sent you forth with mourning and with weeping, but God shall restore you unto me with gladness and with joy forevermore.
**24** For as now the sojourners of Zion have seen our captivity, so shall they quickly see the
**25** salvation from your God, which shall come upon you with great glory and with the brightness of the Everlasting. O my children, be patient [under] the wrath that hath come upon you from God. For your enemy hath pursued you, and he hath come upon his own destruction quickly, and upon the
