**ΣΟΦΙΑ ΚΕΦ. ΛΗʹ.**
30 πάσῃ τρυφῇ, καὶ μὴ ἐκχυθῇς ἐπὶ ἐδεσμάτων· ἐν πολλοῖς γὰρ
βρώμασιν ἔσται νόσος, καὶ ἡ ἀπληστία ἐγγιεῖ ἕως χολέρας·
31 διὰ ἀπληστίαν πολλοὶ ἐτελεύτησαν, ὁ δὲ προσέχων προσθήσει ζωήν.

**ΚΕΦ. ΛΗʹ.**

1 ΤΙΜΑ ἰατρὸν πρὸς τὰς χρείας αὐτοῦ τιμαῖς αὐτοῦ· καὶ
2 γὰρ αὐτὸν ἔκτισε Κύριος, (παρὰ γὰρ ὑψίστου ἐστὶν κτίσις) καὶ
3 παρὰ βασιλέως λήψεται δόμα· ἐπιστήμη ἰατροῦ ἀνυψώσει κεφαλὴν
4 αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔναντι μεγιστάνων θαυμασθήσεται. Κύριος
ἔκτισεν ἐκ γῆς φάρμακα, καὶ ἀνὴρ φρόνιμος οὐ προσοχθιεῖ αὐτοῖς.
5 Οὐκ ἀπὸ ξύλου ἐγλυκάνθη ὕδωρ, εἰς τὸ γνωσθῆναι τὴν
6 ἰσχὺν αὐτοῦ ὑπὸ ἀνθρώπου; Καὶ αὐτὸς ἔδωκεν ἀνθρώπῳ ἐπιστήμην,
7 ἐνδοξάζεσθαι ἐν τοῖς θαυμασίοις αὐτοῦ· ἐν αὐτοῖς ἐθεράπευσε
8 καὶ ἦρε πάντα πόνον αὐτοῦ, μυρεψὸς ἐν τούτοις ποιήσει
μίγμα· καὶ οὐ μὴ συντελεσθῇ ἔργα αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἰρήνη παρ᾿ αὐτοῦ
9 ἐστιν ἐπὶ προσώπου τῆς γῆς. Τέκνον ἐν ἀρρωστήμασί σου μὴ παράβλεπε,
10 ἀλλ᾿ εὔξαι Κυρίῳ, καὶ αὐτὸς ἰάσεταί σε· ἀπόστησον
πλημμέλειαν καὶ εὔθυνον χεῖρας, καὶ ἀπὸ πάσης ἁμαρτίας καθάρισον
11 καρδίαν· δὸς εὐωδίαν καὶ μνημόσυνον σεμιδάλεως, καὶ λίπανον
12 προσφορὰν, ὡς μὴ ὑπάρχων. Καὶ ἰατρῷ δὸς τόπον, καὶ
γὰρ αὐτὸν ἔκτισε Κύριος· καὶ μὴ ἀποστήτω σου, καὶ γὰρ αὐτὸ χρεία.
13. 14 Ἔστι καιρὸς ὅτε καὶ ἐν χερσὶν αὐτῶν εὐοδία· καὶ γὰρ
αὐτοὶ Κυρίου δεηθήσονται, ἵνα εὐοδώσῃ αὐτοῖς ἀνάπαυσιν καὶ ἴασιν
χάριν ἐμβιώσεως.
15 Ὁ ἁμαρτάνων ἔναντι τοῦ ποιήσαντος αὐτὸν,
16 ἐμπέσοι εἰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ. Τέκνον ἐπὶ νεκρῷ κατάγαγε δάκρυα,
καὶ ὡς δεινὰ πάσχων ἔναρξαι θρήνου· κατὰ δὲ τὴν κρίσιν
17 αὐτοῦ περίστειλον τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ, καὶ μὴ ὑπερίδῃς τὴν ταφὴν αὐτοῦ.
18 Πίκρανον κλαυθμὸν, καὶ θέρμανον κοπετὸν, καὶ ποίησον
τὸ πένθος κατὰ τὴν ἀξίαν αὐτοῦ ἡμέραν μίαν καὶ δύο χάριν διαβολῆς,
19 καὶ παρακλήθητι λύπης ἕνεκα· ἀπὸ λύπης γὰρ ἐκβαίνει θάνατος,
20 καὶ λύπη καρδίας κάμπει ἰσχύν. Ἐν ἐπαγωγῇ παραμένει
21 καὶ λύπη, καὶ βίος πτωχοῦ κατάρα καρδίας. Μὴ δῶς εἰς λύπην
τὴν καρδίαν σου, ἀπόστησον αὐτὴν μνησθεὶς τὰ ἔσχατα· μὴ ἐπιλάθῃ,
22 οὐ γὰρ ἐστιν ἐπάνοδος· καὶ τοῦτον οὐκ ὠφελήσεις, καὶ σεαυτὸν
23 κακώσεις. Μνήσθητι τὸ κρίμα μου, ὅτι οὕτως καὶ τὸ σόν·
ἐμοὶ ἐχθές, καὶ σοὶ σήμερον. Ἐν ἀναπαύσει νεκροῦ κατάπαυσον
24 τὸ μνημόσυνον αὐτοῦ, καὶ παρακληθήτῃ ἐν αὐτῷ ἐν ἐξόδῳ πνεύματος αὐτοῦ.
Σοφία γραμματέως ἐν εὐκαιρίᾳ σχολῆς, καὶ ὁ ἐλαττούμενος πράξει αὐτοῦ σοφισθήσεται.
25 Τί σοφισθήσεται ὁ κρατῶν
ἀρότρου, καὶ καυχώμενος ἐν δόρατι ; κέντρῳ βόας ἐλαύνων, καὶ
26 ἀναστρεφόμενος ἐν ἔργοις αὐτῶν, καὶ ἡ διήγησις αὐτοῦ ἐν υἱοῖς
ταύρων· καρδίαν αὐτοῦ δώσει ἐκδοῦναι αὔλακας, καὶ ἡ ἀγρυπνία
27 αὐτοῦ εἰς χορτάσματα δαμάλεων. Οὕτως πᾶς τέκτων καὶ ἀρχιτέκτων,
28 ὅστις νύκτωρ ὡς ἡμέρας διάγει· οἱ γλύφοντες γλύμματα
σφραγίδων, καὶ ἡ ἐπιμονὴ αὐτοῦ ἀλλοιῶσαι ποικιλίαν· καρδίαν
αὐτοῦ δώσει εἰς ὁμοιῶσαι ζωγραφίαν, καὶ ἡ ἀγρυπνία αὐτοῦ τελέσαι ἔργον.
29 Οὕτως χαλκεὺς καθήμενος ἐγγὺς ἄκμονος, καὶ κα-
ταμανθάνων ἔργον σιδήρου· ἀτμὶς πυρὸς τήξει σάρκας αὐτοῦ, καὶ
ἐν θέρμῃ καμίνου διαμάχησεται· φωνὴ σφύρης καὶ ἄκμονος κναίει
τὸ οὖς αὐτοῦ, καὶ κατέναντι ὁμοιώματος σκεύους οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ
αὐτοῦ· καρδίαν αὐτοῦ δώσει εἰς συντέλειαν ἔργων, καὶ ἡ ἀγρυπνία
30 αὐτοῦ κοσμῆσαι ἐπὶ συντελείας. Οὕτως κεραμεὺς καθήμενος ἐν
ἔργῳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ συστρέφων ἐν ποσὶν αὐτοῦ τροχόν, ὃς ἐν μερί-
μνῃ κεῖται διαπαντὸς ἐπὶ τὸ ἔργον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐναρίθμιος πᾶσα
ἡ ἐργασία αὐτοῦ· ἐν βραχίονι αὐτοῦ τυπώσει πηλόν, καὶ πρὸ ποδῶν
31 κάμψει ἰσχὺν αὐτοῦ· καρδίαν ἐπιδώσει συντελέσαι τὸ χρίσμα,
καὶ ἡ ἀγρυπνία αὐτοῦ καθαρίσαι κάμινον. Πάντες οὗτοι εἰς χεῖρας
32 ἔχωσιν· ἐνεπίστευσαν, καὶ ἕκαστος ἐν τῷ ἔργῳ αὐτοῦ σοφίζεται.
Ἄνευ αὐτῶν οὐκ οἰκήσεται πόλις, καὶ οὐ παροικήσουσιν
33 οὐδὲ περιπατήσουσιν· ἐν βουλῇ λαοῦ οὐ ζητηθήσονται, καὶ ἐν
ἐκκλησίᾳ οὐχ ὑπεραλοῦνται· ἐπὶ δίφρον δυνάστου οὐ καθιοῦνται,
καὶ διαθήκην κρίματος οὐ διανοηθήσονται, οὐδὲ μὴ ἐκφανῶσι παιδείαν καὶ κρίμα, καὶ ἐν παραβολαῖς οὐχ εὑρεθήσονται·
34 ἀλλὰ κτίσμα αἰῶνος στηρίσουσι, καὶ ἡ δέησις αὐτῶν
ἐν ἐργασίᾳ τέχνης.

**Chapter Thirty-Seven**

30 in every luxury, and pour not thyself out upon dainties;
    for in many foods there shall be sickness,
    and gluttony shall draw near even unto cholera.
31 Through gluttony have many perished;
    but he that giveth heed shall add [unto his] life.

**Chapter Thirty-Eight**

1 Honor a physician in proportion to his services,
    with the honors due unto him;
2 for the Lord created him;
    (for from the Most High is [his] very creation,)
    and from a king shall he receive a gift.
3 The skill of a physician shall lift up his head,
4 and before great men shall he be admired.
    The Lord hath created medicines out of the earth,
    and a prudent man shall not be offended by them.
5 Was not water made sweet by a tree,
6 that its [healing] power might be known by man?
    And He Himself gave knowledge unto man,
7 that He might be glorified in His wondrous works.
    By them did he heal and took away all his pain;
8 a perfumer shall make a mixture with these;
    and his works shall not be brought to an end;
    for peace is from Him upon the face of the earth.
9 My son, in thy sicknesses, neglect not [the Lord];
10 but pray unto the Lord, and He Himself shall heal thee.
    Turn away [thy] wrongdoing, and make thy hands straight,
    and cleanse [thy] heart from all sin.
11 Give a sweet savor and a memorial offering of fine flour,
    and a fat offering, as if not existing.
12 And give place unto the physician, for the Lord created him;
    and let him not depart from thee, for he is a necessity.
13.14 There is a time when even in their hands there is good success;
    for they themselves shall pray unto the Lord,
    that He may prosper them with rest and healing for the sake of [continued] life.
15 He that sinneth before Him that made him,
16 may he fall into His hands.
    My son, shed tears over the dead,
    and as one suffering sorely, begin thy lamentation.
17 And according to his [due] rite, shroud his body,
    and neglect not his burial.
18 Intensify thy weeping, and make thy lamentation fervent;
    and make thy mourning according to his worth,
    for one day or two, for the sake of [avoiding] calumny;
19 and be comforted for the sake of [moderating] sorrow;
    for from sorrow cometh forth death,
20 and grief of heart doth bend [one's] strength.
    In affliction doth sorrow remain,
21 and the life of a poor man is a curse of heart.
    Give not thy heart unto sorrow;
    remove it, remembering the last things.
22 Forget [these things] not, for there is no returning;
    and thou shalt not profit this one [that is gone],
    and thou shalt harm thine own self.
23 Remember my lot, for thus also is thine:
    to me it was yesterday, and unto thee it is today.
    In the rest of the dead, let his memorial cease;
24 and let him be comforted concerning him at the departure of his spirit.
    The wisdom of a scribe cometh by the opportunity of leisure,
    and he that is made less [burdened] by his work shall be made wise.
25 How shall he become wise that holdeth the plough,
    and boasteth in the goad?
    [Even he that is] driving oxen with a goad,
26 and occupied with their labours;
    and his discourse is among the young bulls.
    He shall give his heart to making furrows,
    and his vigilance
27 is for the fodder of heifers.
    So also every carpenter and master builder,
28 who spendeth his nights as days;
    they that carve engraved seals,
    and whose perseverance is to vary the design;
    he shall give his heart to portraying a likeness,
    and his sleeplessness is to finish his work.
29 So also the smith, sitting by the anvil,
    and observing the work of iron;
    the vapor of fire shall melt his flesh,
    and in the heat of the furnace shall he contend.
    The sound of the hammer and the anvil doth deafen his ear,
    and before the pattern of the vessel are his eyes.
    He shall give his heart to the completion of his works,
    and his sleeplessness
30 is to adorn for completion.
    So also the potter, sitting at his work,
    and turning the wheel with his feet;
    whose concern is ever upon his work,
    and all his labour is precise.
    He shall shape the clay with his arm,
    and before his feet
31 shall he bend his strength.
    He shall apply his heart to completing the glaze,
    and his sleeplessness is to clean the kiln.
    All these [men], let them have [skill] in their hands;
32 they have put their trust [therein],
    and each one is made wise in his work.
    Without these, a city shall not be inhabited,
    and they shall not sojourn [therein];
33 nor shall they walk about [with ease].
    In the counsel of the people shall they not be sought,
    and in the assembly shall they not be advanced.
    Upon the seat of the ruler shall they not sit,
    and the covenant of judgment shall they not understand;
    nor shall they declare instruction and judgment,
    and in parables shall they not be found.
34 But they shall establish the creation of the world,
    and their prayer is in the work of their craft.
