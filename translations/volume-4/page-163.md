31 δεξιά μετὰ τῆς ἀδείας. Χρῆσθαι τοὺς Ἰουδαίους τοῖς ἑαυτῶν
32 δαπανήμασι καὶ νόμοις καθὰ καὶ τὸ πρότερον, καὶ οὐδεὶς αὐτῶν
33 κατ’ οὐδένα τρόπον παρενοχληθήσεται περὶ τῶν ἠγνημένων. Πέ-
34 πομφα δὲ καὶ τὸν Μενέλαον παρακαλέσοντα ὑμᾶς. Ἔρρωσθε.
    ἔτους ἑκατοστοῦ τεσσαρακοστοῦ ὀγδόου, Ξανθικοῦ πεντεκαιδεκάτῃ.
35 Ἐπεμψαν δὲ καὶ οἱ Ῥωμαῖοι πρὸς αὐτοὺς ἐπιστολὴν ἔχουσαν οὕ-
    τως· Κοίντος Μέμμιος, Τίτος Μάνλιος πρεσβύται Ῥωμαίων,
36 τῷ δήμῳ τῶν Ἰουδαίων χαίρειν. Ὑπὲρ ὧν Λυσίας ὁ συγ-
    γενὴς τοῦ βασιλέως συνεχώρησεν ὑμῖν, καὶ ἡμεῖς συνευδοκοῦμεν.
37 ἃ δὲ ἔκρινε προσανανενηχθαι τῷ βασιλεῖ, πέμψατέ τινα παρα-
    χρῆμα ἐπισκεψάμενοι περὶ τούτων, ἵνα ἐκθῶμεν, ὡς καθήκει ἡμῖν,
38 ἡμεῖς γὰρ προσάγομεν πρὸς Ἀντιόχειαν. Διὸ σπεύσατε, καὶ
    πέμψατέ τινας, ὅπως καὶ ἡμεῖς ἐπιγνῶμεν ὁποίας ἐστὲ γνώμης.
39 Ὑγιαίνετε· ἔτους ἑκατοστοῦ τεσσαρακοστοῦ ὀγδόου, Ξανθικοῦ
    πεντεκαιδεκάτῃ.

1 ΓΕΝΟΜΕΝΩΝ δὲ τῶν συνθηκῶν τούτων, ὁ μὲν Λυσίας ἀπῄει
    πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα, οἱ δὲ Ἰουδαῖοι περὶ τὴν γεωργίαν ἐγίνοντο.

    Γενναίου, ἔτι δὲ Ἱερώνυμος καὶ Δημοφῶν, πρὸς δὲ τούτοις Νι-

**Chapter 11**

**31** There shall be a pledge [given], together with full immunity. And that the Jews shall use their own expenditures and their laws, even as in times past;
**32** and no man among them shall be molested in any wise concerning those things which they have unwittingly done.
**34** Moreover, I have sent Menelaus also to exhort you. Fare ye well. In the one hundred forty-eighth year, on the fifteenth day of Xanthicus.
**35** Moreover, the Romans also sent a letter unto them, whose tenor was this: Quintus Memmius, and Titus Manlius, the ambassadors of the Romans, to the people of the Jews, sendeth greeting.
**36** As touching those things which Lysias, the king's kinsman, hath granted unto you, we also are well pleased therewith.
**37** But concerning such things as he thought needful to be referred unto the king, send ye some forth with, having taken counsel concerning these matters, that we may set them forth, as it becometh us;
**38** for we are journeying toward Antioch. Wherefore make haste, and send ye certain [men], that we also may know of what mind ye be.
**39** Fare ye well. In the one hundred forty-eighth year, on the fifteenth day of Xanthicus.

**Chapter 12**

**1** Now when these covenants were made, Lysias indeed departed unto the king, but the Jews betook themselves to agriculture.
**2** But Timothy, and Apollonius the son of Gennæus, among the commanders in those regions, and moreover, Hieronymus and Demophon, and beyond these, Nicanor the Cypriarch, suffered them not to remain in quietness and to lead a tranquil life.
**3** The people of Joppa, moreover, wrought so great a wickedness, for they did invite the Jews that dwelt among them to embark upon the boats which they themselves had provided, with wives and
**4** children, as if no enmity were against them; but according to a common decree of the city, and when these had accepted [the invitation],
**5** as though they desired to live in peace and harboured no suspicion, they were put to sea and drowned, being no fewer than two hundred souls. Now when
**6** Judas had learned of the cruelty which had been wrought against his countrymen, he gave charge unto the men that were with him, and having called upon God, the righteous Judge, he came against those that hated his brethren, and burned the harbour by night, and the
**7** ships he consumed with fire, and those that had fled thither he put to the sword. And when the place was shut up, he withdrew, as purposing to return again,
**8** and to root out the whole community of the Joppites. And having learned also
