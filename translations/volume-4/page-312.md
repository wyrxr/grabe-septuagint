ὄνομα, τοῦ ἐκδιηγήσασθαι ἐπαίνους· καὶ εἰσὶν ὧν οὐκ ἔστι μνημό- 9
συνον, καὶ ἀπώλοντο ὡς οὐχ ὑπάρξαντες, καὶ ἐγένοντο ὡς οὐ
γεγονότες, καὶ τὰ τέκνα αὐτῶν μετ᾽ αὐτούς. Ἀλλ᾽ οὗτοι ἄνδρες 10
ἐλέους, ὧν αἱ δικαιοσύναι οὐκ ἐπελήσθησαν· μετὰ τοῦ σπέρματος 11
αὐτῶν διαμενεῖ ἀγαθὴ κληρονομία, ἔκγονα αὐτῶν ἐν ταῖς δια-
θήκαις· ἔστη τὸ σπέρμα αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ τέκνα αὐτῶν δι᾽ αὐτοὺς 12
ἕως αἰῶνος μενεῖ σπέρμα αὐτῶν, καὶ ἡ δόξα αὐτῶν οὐκ ἐξαλει- 13
φθήσεται· τὰ σώματα αὐτῶν ἐν εἰρήνῃ ἐτάφη, καὶ τὸ ὄνομα αὐ- 14
τῶν ζῇ εἰς γενεάς· σοφίαν αὐτῶν διηγήσονται λαοί, καὶ τὸν 15
ἔπαινον αὐτῶν ἐξαγγελεῖ ἐκκλησία. Ἐνὼχ εὐηρέστησε Κυρίῳ, 16
καὶ μετετέθη, ὑπόδειγμα μετανοίας ταῖς γενεαῖς. Νῶε εὑρέθη 17
τέλειος δίκαιος, ἐν καιρῷ ὀργῆς ἐγένετο ἀντάλλαγμα· διὰ τοῦ-
το ἐγενήθη κατάλειμμα τῇ γῇ, ὅτε ἐγένετο ὁ κατακλυσμός·
διαθῆκαι αἰῶνος ἐτέθησαν πρὸς αὐτόν, ἵνα μὴ ἐξαλειφθῇ πᾶσα 18
σάρξ. Ἀβραὰμ μέγας πατὴρ πλήθους ἐθνῶν, καὶ οὐχ εὑρέθη 19
ὅμοιος αὐτῷ ἐν τῇ δόξῃ· ὃς συντήρησε νόμον ὑψίστου, καὶ ἐγέ- 20
νετο ἐν διαθήκῃ μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ· ἐν σαρκὶ αὐτοῦ ἔστησε διαθήκην, καὶ
ἐν πειρασμῷ εὑρέθη πιστός· διὰ τοῦτο ἐν ὅρκῳ ἔστησεν αὐτῷ 21
εὐλογηθῆναι ἔθνη ἐν σπέρματι αὐτοῦ, πληθύναι αὐτὸν ὡς χοῦν
τῆς γῆς, καὶ ὡς ἄστρα ἀνυψῶσαι τὸ σπέρμα αὐτοῦ, καὶ κατακλη-
ρονομῆσαι αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ θαλάσσης ἕως θαλάσσης, καὶ ἀπὸ ποταμοῦ
ἕως ἄκρου τῆς γῆς. Καὶ ἐν τῷ Ἰσαὰκ ἔστησεν οὕτως διὰ Ἀ- 22
βραὰμ τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ εὐλογίαν πάντων ἀνθρώπων καὶ διαθή-
κην. Καὶ κατέπαυσεν ἐπὶ κεφαλὴν Ἰακώβ· ἐπίγνω αὐτὸν ἐν εὐ- 23
λογίαις αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ ἐν κληρονομίᾳ· καὶ διέστειλε
μερίδας αὐτοῦ, ἐν φυλαῖς ἐμέρισε δεκαδύο· καὶ ἐξήγαγεν ἐξ αὐτοῦ
ἄνδρα ἐλέους, εὑρίσκοντα χάριν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς πάσης σαρκός.

Ἤγαπημένος ὑπὸ Θεοῦ καὶ ἀνθρώπων Μωσῆς, εὖ τὸ 1
μνημόσυνον ἐν εὐλογίαις· ὡμοίωσεν αὐτὸν ἐν δόξῃ ἁγίων, καὶ 2
ἐμεγάλυνεν αὐτὸν ἐν φόβοις ἐχθρῶν· ἐν λόγοις αὐτοῦ σημεῖα κα- 3
τέπαυσεν, ἐδόξασεν αὐτὸν κατὰ πρόσωπον βασιλέων· ἐνετείλατο
αὐτῷ πρὸς λαὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔδειξεν αὐτῷ τῆς δόξης αὐτοῦ· ἐν 4
πίστει καὶ πραότητι αὐτὸν ἡγίασεν, ἐξελέξατο αὐτὸν ἐκ πάσης σαρκός.

**The Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach**

**Chapter Forty-Four**

8 ...[who left] a name, that their praises might be recounted.
9 And there are some, of whom there is no memorial,
Who perished as though they had never been,
And came to be as though they had not been born;
And their children after them.
10 But these were men of mercy,
Whose righteous deeds were not forgotten.
11 With their seed shall a good inheritance abide;
Their offspring [are comprehended] within the covenants.
12 Their seed and their children stood fast by reason of them;
Unto the age shall their seed remain,
And their glory shall not be blotted out.
13 Their bodies were laid to rest in peace,
And their name
14 Shall live through generations.
Their wisdom shall the peoples recount,
15 And their praise shall the congregation declare.
16 Enoch pleased the Lord, and was translated;
[He was] a pattern of repentance unto the generations.
17 Noah was found perfect and righteous;
In the time of wrath he became a propitiation.
Therefore, was he made a remnant unto the earth,
When the flood came to pass;
18 Covenants everlasting were established with him,
That all flesh should not be blotted out.
19 Abraham, a great father of a multitude of nations,
And none was found like him in glory;
20 Who kept the law of the Most High,
And entered into covenant with Him.
In his flesh he established a covenant,
And in trial was he found faithful.
21 Therefore, did He establish for him by an oath
That the nations should be blessed in his seed;
To multiply him as the dust of the earth,
And to exalt his seed as the stars;
And to cause them to inherit from sea unto sea,
And from the River unto the uttermost part of the earth.
22 And in Isaac did He establish likewise,
For Abraham his father's sake,
A blessing unto all men and a covenant.
23 And He rested upon the head of Jacob;
He acknowledged him by His blessings,
And gave him an inheritance.
And He apportioned his portions,
He divided them into twelve tribes;
And He brought forth from him a man of mercy,
Who found favor in the eyes of all flesh.

**Chapter Forty-Five**

1 Moses, beloved of God and of men,
Blessed is his memorial in [all] blessings.
2 He made him like unto the glory of the saints,
And magnified him amid the dread of his foes.
3 By his words did He cause signs to be established;
He glorified him before the presence of kings.
4 He gave him commandments for His people,
And showed him of His glory;
In faith and meekness did He sanctify him,
And chose him out of all flesh.
