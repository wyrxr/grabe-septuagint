27 καθαγίασον. Ἐπισυνάγαγε τὴν διασπορὰν ἡμῶν, ἐλευθέρωσον τοὺς
      δουλεύοντας ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι, τοὺς ἐξουθενημένους καὶ βδελυκτοὺς
28 ἔπιδε, καὶ γνώτωσαν τὰ ἔθνη, ὅτι σὺ εἶ ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν. Βασάνισον
29 τοὺς καταδυναστεύοντας καὶ ἐξυβρίζοντας ἐν ὑπερηφανίᾳ. Καταφύτευσον τὸν λαόν σου εἰς τὸν τόπον τὸν ἅγιόν σου, καθὼς εἶπε
30. 31 Μωσῆς. Οἱ δὲ ἱερεῖς ἐπέβαλλον τοὺς ὕμνους. Καθὼς δὲ ἀνηλώθη τὰ τῆς θυσίας, καὶ τὸ περιλειπόμενον ὕδωρ, ὁ Νεεμίας
32 ἐκέλευσε λίθους μείζονας καταχεῖν. Ὡς δὲ τοῦτο ἐγενήθη, φλὸξ ἀνήφθη· τοῦ δὲ ἀπὸ τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου ἀντιλάμψαντος φωτὸς ἐδαπανήθη. Ὡς δὲ φανερὸν ἐγενήθη τὸ πρᾶγμα, καὶ διηγγέλη τῷ
      βασιλεῖ τῶν Περσῶν, ὅτι εἰς τὸν τόπον, οὗ τὸ πῦρ ἔκρυψαν οἱ
      μεταχθέντες ἱερεῖς, τὸ ὕδωρ ἐφάνη, ἀφ᾿ οὗ καὶ οἱ περὶ τὸν Νεε-
34 μίαν ἤγνισαν τὰ τῆς θυσίας, περιφράξας δὲ ὁ βασιλεὺς ἱερὸν ἐ-
35 ποίησε, δοκιμάσας τὸ πρᾶγμα. Καὶ οἷς ἐχαρίζετο ὁ βασιλεὺς
36 πολλὰ διάφορα ἐλάμβανε καὶ μετεδίδου. Προσηγόρευσαν δὲ οἱ περὶ τὸν Νεεμίαν τοῦτο Νέφθαρ, ὃ διερμηνεύεται καθαρισμός· καλεῖται δὲ παρὰ τοῖς πολλοῖς Νεφθαεί.

ΚΕΦ. Β΄. ΙΙ.

1  ΕΥΡΙΣΚΕΤΑΙ δὲ ἐν ταῖς ἀπογραφαῖς Ἱερεμίας ὁ προφήτης,
   ὅτι ἐκέλευσε τοῦ πυρὸς λαβεῖν τοὺς μεταγενομένους, ὡς σεσή-
2  μανται. Καὶ ὡς ἐνετείλατο τοῖς μεταγενομένοις ὁ προφήτης,
   δοὺς αὐτοῖς τὸν νόμον, ἵνα μὴ ἐπιλάθωνται τῶν προσταγμάτων
   τοῦ Κυρίου, καὶ ἵνα μὴ ἀποπλανηθῶσι ταῖς διανοίαις, βλέποντες
3  ἀγάλματα χρυσᾶ καὶ ἀργυρᾶ καὶ τὸν περὶ αὐτὰ κόσμον. Καὶ
   ἕτερα τοιαῦτα λέγων, παρεκάλει μὴ ἀποστῆναι τὸν νόμον ἀπὸ
4  τῆς καρδίας αὐτῶν. Ἦν δὲ ἐν τῇ γραφῇ, ὡς τὴν σκηνὴν καὶ
   τὴν κιβωτὸν ἐκέλευσεν ὁ προφήτης χρηματισμοῦ γενηθέντος αὐτῷ
   συνακολουθεῖν, ὡς δὲ ἐξῆλθεν εἰς τὸ ὄρος οὗ ὁ Μωσῆς ἀναβὰς
5  ἐθεάσατο τὴν τοῦ Θεοῦ κληρονομίαν, καὶ ἐλθὼν ὁ Ἱερεμίας εὗ-
   ρεν οἶκον ἀντρώδη, καὶ τὴν σκηνὴν καὶ τὴν κιβωτὸν καὶ τὸ θυ-
   σιαστήριον τοῦ θυμιάματος εἰσήνεγκεν ἐκεῖ, καὶ τὴν θύραν ἐνέφραξε, καὶ προσελθόντες τινὲς τῶν συνακολουθούντων ὥστε ἐπισημήνασθαι τὴν ὁδόν, καὶ οὐκ ἐδυνήθησαν εὑρεῖν. Ὡς δὲ ὁ Ἱερε-
7  μίας ἔγνω, μεμφόμενος αὐτοῖς εἶπεν· ὅτι καὶ ἄγνωστος ὁ τόπος

**27** [even as Thou hast made them Thine own,] do Thou sanctify [it]. Gather together our scattered ones, set free them that are in bondage among the nations, look upon the despised and the detestable;
**28** and let the nations know that Thou art our God. Torment them that oppress and do insult in their pride.
**29** Plant Thy people in Thy holy place, as Moses said.
**30** Then the priests raised up the hymns.
**31** And when the things of the sacrifice, and the remaining water, were consumed, Nehemiah commanded [men] to cast down larger stones [upon them].
**32** And when this was done, a flame was kindled; and the light that shone forth from the altar did consume it.
**33** And when the matter was made manifest, and it was reported to the king of the Persians, that in the place where the priests who were carried away had hidden the fire, water had appeared, from which also those about Nehemiah had consecrated the things of the sacrifice;
**34** then the king, having enclosed the place, made it a sanctuary, after he had examined the matter.
**35** And unto those whom the king favoured, he did give many diverse [gifts], receiving [much revenue from the sanctuary] and distributing [it].
**36** Now those about Nehemiah named this thing Nephthar, which is interpreted Purification; but by many it is called Nephthaei.

#### CHAPTER II.

**1** Moreover, it is found in the records that Jeremiah the prophet commanded those who were to be carried away to take of the fire, as it hath been noted.
**2** And as the prophet charged them that were to be carried away, giving them the law, that they should not forget the commandments of the Lord, and that their minds should not be led astray, seeing
**3** images of gold and silver, and the adorning that was about them. And speaking other such things, he besought them that the law might not depart from their hearts.
**4** Now it was in the writing, how that the prophet commanded the tabernacle and the ark to follow [him], a divine oracle having been given to him; and when he went forth to the mountain, whither Moses went up,
**5** and beheld the inheritance of God, Jeremiah came and found a cavernous dwelling, and he brought in thither the tabernacle and the ark and the altar of incense; and he sealed up the door.
**6** And when some of them that followed with him drew near, so as to mark the way,
**7** they were not able to find it. And when Jeremiah knew [of it], reproving them he said, "The place shall also be unknown,"
