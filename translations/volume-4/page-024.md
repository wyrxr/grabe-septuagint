18 καὶ ἐπισιτισμὸν παντὶ ἀνδρὶ εἰς πλῆθος, καὶ χρυσίον καὶ ἀργύριον
19 ἐξ οἴκου βασιλέως πολὺ σφόδρα. Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν αὐτὸς καὶ πᾶσα ἡ
δύναμις αὐτοῦ εἰς πορείαν τοῦ προελθεῖν βασιλέως Ναβουχοδο-
νόσορ, καὶ καλύψαι πᾶν τὸ πρόσωπον τῆς γῆς πρὸς δυσμαῖς ἐν
ἅρμασι καὶ ἱππεῦσι, καὶ πεζοῖς ἐπιλέκτοις αὐτῶν. 20 Καὶ πολὺς
ὁ ἐπίμικτος ὡς ἄκρις συνεξῆλθον αὐτοῖς, καὶ ὡς ἡ ἄμμος τῆς γῆς·
οὐ γὰρ ἦν ἀριθμὸς ἀπὸ πλήθους αὐτῶν. 21 Καὶ ἐξῆλθον ἐκ Νινευὴ
ὁδὸν τριῶν ἡμερῶν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον τοῦ πεδίου Βεκτελέθ, καὶ ἐστρα-
τοπέδευσαν ἀπὸ Βεκτελέθ, πλησίον τοῦ ὄρους τοῦ ἐπ᾿ ἀριστε-
ρᾷ τῆς ἄνω Κιλικίας. 22 Καὶ ἔλαβε πᾶσαν τὴν δύναμιν αὐτοῦ,
τοὺς πεζούς, καὶ τοὺς ἱππεῖς, καὶ τὰ ἅρματα αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀπῆλθεν
ἐκεῖθεν εἰς τὴν ὀρεινήν. 23 Καὶ διέκοψε τοὺς Φοὺδ καὶ Λοὺδ, καὶ
ἐπρονόμευσε πάντας υἱοὺς Ῥασσεὶς καὶ υἱοὺς Ἰσμαὴλ τοὺς κατὰ
πρόσωπον τῆς ἐρήμου πρὸς νότον τῆς Χελεῶν. 24 Καὶ παρῆλθε τὸν
Εὐφράτην, καὶ διῆλθε τὴν Μεσοποταμίαν, καὶ κατέσκαψε πάσας
τὰς πόλεις τὰς ὑψηλὰς τὰς ἐπὶ τοῦ χειμάρρου Ἀβρωνᾷ ἕως τοῦ
ἐλθεῖν ἐπὶ θάλασσαν. 25 Καὶ κατελάβετο τὰ ὅρια τῆς Κιλικίας, καὶ
κατέκοψε πάντας τοὺς ἀντιστᾶντας αὐτῷ· καὶ ἦλθεν ἕως ὁρίων
Ἰάφεθ, τὰ πρὸς νότον κατὰ πρόσωπον τῆς Ἀραβίας. 26 Καὶ ἐκύ-
κλωσε πάντας τοὺς υἱοὺς Μαδιάμ, καὶ ἐνέπρησε τὰ σκηνώματα
αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπρονόμευσε τὰς μάνδρας αὐτῶν. 27 Καὶ κατέβη εἰς
πεδίον Δαμασκοῦ ἐν ἡμέραις θερισμοῦ πυρῶν, καὶ ἐνέπρησε πάν-
τας τοὺς ἀγροὺς αὐτῶν· καὶ τὰ ποίμνια καὶ τὰ βουκόλια ἔδω-
κεν εἰς ἀφανισμόν, καὶ τὰς πόλεις αὐτῶν ἐσκύλευσε, καὶ τὰ πε-
δία αὐτῶν ἐξελίκμησε, καὶ ἐπάταξε πάντας τοὺς νεανίσκους αὐ-
τῶν ἐν στόματι ῥομφαίας. 28 Καὶ ἔπεσεν ὁ φόβος καὶ ὁ τρόμος αὐ-
τοῦ ἐπὶ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας τὴν παραλίαν, τοὺς ὄντας ἐν Σιδῶνι
καὶ ἐν Τύρῳ, καὶ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας Σοὺρ, καὶ Ὀκεινά, καὶ πάν-
τας τοὺς κατοικοῦντας Ἰεμνάαν. καὶ οἱ κατοικοῦντες ἐν Ἀζώτῳ
καὶ Ἀσκαλῶνι ἐφοβήθησαν αὐτὸν σφόδρα.

1 ΚΑΙ ἀπέστειλαν πρὸς αὐτὸν ἀγγέλους λόγοις εἰρηνικοῖς, λέ-
γοντες· 2 Ἰδοὺ ἡμεῖς οἱ παῖδες Ναβουχοδονόσορ βασιλέως μεγάλου
παρακείμεθα ἐνώπιόν σου, χρῆσαι ἡμῖν καθὼς ἀρεστόν ἐστι τῷ

#### CHAPTER 2

18 and provisions for every man in abundance, and gold and silver
19 from the king's house, exceeding much. And he himself went forth, and all his host, upon the journey to go forth for King Nebuchadnezzar, and to cover all the face of the earth toward the west with chariots and horsemen, and with their chosen footmen.
20 And a great mixed multitude went forth with them, like unto locusts, and as the sand of the earth; for there was no number by reason of their multitude.
21 And they departed from Nineveh, a journey of three days, toward the plain of Bectileth; and they encamped from Bectileth, nigh unto the mountain that is on the left hand of Upper Cilicia.
22 And he took all his host, the footmen, and the horsemen, and his chariots, and departed thence into the hill country.
23 And he smote Phud and Lud, and plundered all the sons of Rasseis and the sons of Ishmael, which were before the desert toward the south of Cheleon.
24 And he passed over the Euphrates, and went through Mesopotamia, and tore down all the high cities that were upon the torrent of Abron, until he came to the sea.
25 And he seized the borders of Cilicia, and cut down all them that resisted him; and he came even unto the borders of Japheth, [even] those toward the south before Arabia.
26 And he encompassed all the sons of Midian, and burned their encampments, and plundered their folds.
27 And he went down to the plain of Damascus in the days of the wheat harvest, and burned all their fields; and the flocks and the herds he gave over unto utter destruction; and their cities he plundered, and their plains he laid waste, and he smote all their young men with the edge of the sword.
28 And the fear and the dread of him fell upon them that dwelt on the seacoast, those that were in Sidon and in Tyre, and them that dwelt in Sur, and Okeina, and all them that dwelt in Jamnia. And those that dwelt in Azotus and Ashkelon feared him exceedingly.

#### CHAPTER 3

1 And they sent messengers unto him with words of peace, saying:
2 "Behold, we are the servants of Nebuchadnezzar, the great king, and we lie before thee; use us as it is pleasing in thy sight."
