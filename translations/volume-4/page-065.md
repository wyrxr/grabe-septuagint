65 αἰχμαλωσίας οἰκοδομοῦσι τὸν ναὸν τῷ Κυρίῳ Θεῷ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ
    προσέλθοντες τῷ Ζοροβάβελ, καὶ Ἰησοῦ, καὶ τοῖς ἡγουμένοις τῶν
66 πατριῶν, λέγουσιν αὐτοῖς· συνοικοδομήσομεν ὑμῖν. Ὁμοίως γὰρ ὑ-
    μῖν ἀκούομεν τοῦ Κυρίου ὑμῶν, καὶ αὐτῷ ἐπιθύομεν ἀπὸ ἡμερῶν
    Ἀσαρχαρεὰ βασιλέως Ἀσσυρίων, ὃς μετήγαγεν ἡμᾶς ἐνταῦθα.
67 Καὶ εἶπαν αὐτοῖς Ζοροβάβελ καὶ Ἰησοῦς, καὶ οἱ ἡγούμενοι τῶν
    πατριῶν τοῦ Ἰσραήλ. οὐχ ἡμῖν καὶ ὑμῖν τοῦ οἰκοδομῆσαι τὸν οἶ-
68 κον Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ ἡμῶν. Ἡμεῖς γὰρ μόνοι οἰκοδομήσομεν τῷ
    Κυρίῳ τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ ἀκολούθως οἷς προσέταξεν ἡμῖν Κῦρος ὁ βα-
69 σιλεὺς Περσῶν. Τὰ δὲ ἔθνη τῆς γῆς ἐπικοιμώμενα τοῖς ἐν τῇ Ἰου-
70 δαίᾳ, καὶ πολιορκοῦντες, εἶργον τοῦ οἰκοδομεῖν. Καὶ ἐπιβουλὰς
    καὶ δημαγωγίας καὶ ἐπισυστάσεις ποιούμενοι, ἀπεκώλυσαν τοῦ
    ἐπιτελεσθῆναι τὴν οἰκοδομὴν πάντα τὸν χρόνον τῆς ζωῆς τοῦ βα-
    σιλέως Κύρου. καὶ εἴρχθησαν τῆς οἰκοδομῆς ἔτη δύο, ἕως τῆς
    Δαρείου βασιλείας.

1   ἘΝ δὲ τῷ δευτέρῳ ἔτει τῆς τοῦ Δαρείου βασιλείας, ἐπροφή-
    τευσεν Ἀγγαῖος, καὶ Ζαχαρίας ὁ τοῦ Ἀδδώ, οἱ προφῆται, ἐπὶ
    τοὺς Ἰουδαίους τοὺς ἐν τῇ Ἰουδαίᾳ καὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ, ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνό-
2   ματι Κυρίου Θεοῦ Ἰσραὴλ ἐπ᾽ αὐτοῦς. Τότε στὰς Ζοροβάβελ ὁ
    τοῦ Σαλαθιήλ, καὶ Ἰησοῦς ὁ τοῦ Ἰωσεδέκ, ἤρξαντο οἰκοδομεῖν τὸν
    οἶκον τοῦ Κυρίου τὸν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, συνόντων τῶν προφητῶν
3   τοῦ Κυρίου, βοηθούντων αὐτοῖς. Ἐν αὐτῷ τῷ χρόνῳ παρῆν πρὸς
    αὐτοὺς Σισίννης ὁ ἔπαρχος Συρίας καὶ Φοινίκης, καὶ Σαθραβου-
4   ζάνης, καὶ οἱ συνεταῖροι αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπαν αὐτοῖς. Τίνος ὑμῖν συν-
    τάξαντος, τὸν οἶκον τοῦτον οἰκοδομεῖτε, καὶ τὴν στέγην ταύτην
    καὶ τ᾽ ἄλλα πάντα ἐπιτελεῖτε ; καὶ τίνες εἰσὶν οἱ οἰκοδόμοι οἵ
5   ταῦτα ἐπιτελοῦντες ; Καὶ ἔσχοσαν χάριν, ἐπισκοπῆς γενομένης
    ἐπὶ τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν, παρὰ τοῦ Κυρίου οἱ πρεσβύτεροι τῶν Ἰου-
6   δαίων· καὶ οὐκ ἐκωλύθησαν τῆς οἰκοδομῆς, μέχρι τοῦ ὑποση-
7   μανθῆναι Δαρείῳ περὶ αὐτῶν, καὶ προσφωνηθῆναι. ΑΝΤΙΓΡΑ-

**Chapter V.**

**65** ...[them] from the captivity building the Temple unto the Lord God of Israel. And they drew near unto Zerubbabel, and unto Jeshua, and unto the leaders of the fathers' houses, saying unto them:
**66** "We will build with you. For we also hear your Lord, and we sacrifice unto Him from the days of Esarhaddon, king of the Assyrians, who brought us up hither."
**67** Then answered Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the leaders of the fathers' houses of Israel, and said unto them: "It is not for us and for you to build an house unto the Lord our God.
**68** For we alone will build unto the Lord of Israel, according to that which Cyrus, the king of Persia, hath commanded us."
**69** But the nations of the land, lying in wait against them that were in Judea, and besieging [them], did hinder them from building.
**70** And making conspiracies, and seditious acts, and hostile gatherings, they prevented the building from being completed all the time of the life of King Cyrus. And they were held back from the building for two years, until the reign of Darius.

**Chapter VI.**

**1** Now in the second year of the reign of Darius, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, the prophets, prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judea and Jerusalem,
**2** in the Name of the Lord God of Israel, [prophesying] unto them. Then stood up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Josedek, and began to build the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem,
**3** the prophets of the Lord being with them, and helping them. In that same time, Sisinnes the satrap of Syria and Phoenicia, and Sathrabouzanes, and their companions, came unto them and said:
**4** "By whose command do you build this house, and finish this roof and all other things? And who are the builders that perform these things?"
**5** And the elders of the Jews obtained favor, for an oversight was made upon the captivity by the Lord;
**6** and they were not hindered from the building, until the matter was reported unto Darius concerning them, and a decree was proclaimed.
**7** This is the Copy of the Letter which Sisinnes the satrap of Syria and Phoenicia, and Sathrabouzanes, and their companions, the governors in Syria and Phoenicia, wrote and sent unto King Darius, [saying]: "Greeting unto King Darius.
**8** Let all things be known unto our lord the king, that...
