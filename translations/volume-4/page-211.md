15 ἐπλήρωσαν τὴν εἰς τὸν Θεὸν εὐσέβειαν. Σὺ δὲ κακὸς κακῶς ὀμώ-
16 ξεις, τοὺς τῆς ἀρετῆς ἀγωνιστὰς ἀναιτίως ἀποκτείνας. Ὅθεν καὶ
17 αὐτὸς ἀποθνήσκειν μέλλων, ἔφη· Οὐκ ἀπαυτομολῶ τῆς τῶν ἀδελ-
18 φῶν μου ἀριστείας. Ἐπικαλοῦμαι δὲ τὸν πατρῶον Θεὸν, ὅπως
19 ἵλεως γένηται τῷ γένει μου. Σὲ δὲ καὶ ἐν τῷ νῦν βίῳ καὶ θανόντα
20 τιμωρήσεται. Καὶ ταῦτα κατευξάμενος, ἑαυτὸν ἐξέῤῥιψεν κατὰ τῶν
21 τηγάνων· καὶ οὕτως ἀπέδωκεν τὴν ψυχήν.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΓ´. ΧΙΙΙ.

1 Εἰ δὲ τοίνυν τῶν μέχρι θανάτου πόνων ὑπερφρόνησαν οἱ
2 ἑπτὰ ἀδελφοὶ, συνομολογεῖται πανταχόθεν, ὅτι αὐτοδέσποτός ἐστιν
3 τῶν παθῶν ὁ εὐσεβὴς λογισμός. Ὥσπερ γὰρ εἰ τοῖς πάθεσιν δου-
4 λωθέντες ἐμιαροφάγησαν, ἐλέγομεν γὰρ αὐτοὺς τούτους νενικῆσθαι.
5 Νυνὶ δὲ οὐχ οὕτως· ἀλλὰ τῷ ἐπαινουμένῳ λογισμῷ παρὰ Θεῷ
6 περιεγένετο τῶν παθῶν. Καὶ οὐκ ἐστὶν παριδεῖν τὴν ἡγεμονίαν τῆς
7 διανοίας· ἐπεκράτησεν γὰρ καὶ πάθους καὶ πόνων. Πῶς οὖν οὐκ ἐστὶν
8 τούτοις τὴν τῆς εὐλογιστίας παθοκρατορίαν ὁμολογεῖν, οἱ τῶν μὲν
9 διὰ πυρὸς ἀλγηδόνων οὐκ ἐπεστράφησαν; Καθάπερ γὰρ προβλῆ-
10 τες λιμένων πύργοι τὰς τῶν κυμάτων ἀπειλὰς ἀνακόπτοντες, γα-
11 ληνὴν παρέχουσιν τοῖς ἐμπλέουσιν τὸν ὅρμον. Οὕτως ἡ ἑπτάπυργος
12 τῶν νεανίσκων εὐλογιστία τὸν τῆς εὐσεβείας ὀχυρώσασα λιμένα τὴν
13 τῶν παθῶν ἐνίκησεν ἀκολασίαν. Ἱερὸν γὰρ εὐσεβείας στήσαντες
14 χορὸν παρεθάρσυνον ἀλλήλους, λέγοντες· Ἀδελφικῶς ἀποθάνοιμεν
15 ἀδελφοὶ περὶ τοῦ νόμου· μιμησώμεθα τοὺς τρεῖς τοὺς ἐπὶ τῆς Ἀσ-
16 συρίας νεανίσκους, οἳ τῆς ἰσοπάλιδος καμίνου κατεφρόνησαν. Μὴ
17 δειλανδρήσωμεν πρὸς τὴν τῆς εὐσεβείας ἀπόδειξιν. Καὶ ὁ μὲν, θάῤ-
18 ῥει ἀδελφὲ, ἔλεγεν, ὁ δὲ, εὐγενῶς καρτέρησον. Ὁ δὲ, καταμνη-
19 σθεὶς ἔλεγεν· μνήσθητε πόθεν ἐστὲ, ἢ τίνος πατρὸς χειρὶ σφα-
20 γιασθῆναι διὰ τὴν εὐσέβειαν ὑπέμεινεν ὁ Ἰσαάκ. Εἷς δὲ ἕκαστος
21 καὶ ἀλλήλους ὁμοῦ πάντες ἐφορῶντες φαιδροὶ καὶ μάλα θαῤῥαλέοι,
22 ἑαυτοὺς, ἔλεγον, τῷ Θεῷ ἀφιερώσωμεν ἐξ ὅλης τῆς καρδίας τῷ
23 δόντι τὰς ψυχὰς, καὶ χρήσωμεν τῇ περὶ τὸν νόμον φυλακῇ τὰ σώ-
24 ματα. Μὴ φοβηθῶμεν τὸν δοκοῦντα ἀποκτείνειν τὸ σῶμα.
25 Μέγας γὰρ ψυχῆς ἀγὼν καὶ κίνδυνος ἐν αἰωνίῳ βασάνῳ κείμενος
26 τοῖς παραβᾶσιν τὴν ἐντολὴν τοῦ Θεοῦ. Καθοπλισώμεθα τοιγαροῦν

**CHAPTER XII.**

**15** did fulfill their piety toward God. But thou, a wicked man, shalt miserably perish,
**16** having slain without cause the champions of virtue.
**17** Wherefore, he also, being about to die, said: "I will not betray the valor of my brethren.
**18** But I call upon the God of my fathers, that He may be merciful unto my race.
**19** And as for thee, He shall punish thee both in this present life and after thou art dead."
**20** And having prayed thus, he cast himself down upon the frying-pans;
**21** and so he yielded up his soul.

**CHAPTER XIII.**

**1** If then the seven brethren scorned the torments [even] unto death,
**2** it is confessed on all sides, that pious reason is master of the passions.
**3** For if, having been enslaved by the passions, they had eaten abominable things,
**4** then we would have said that these themselves had been vanquished.
**5** But now, it is not so; nay, by [their] reason, which is praised by God,
**6** it prevailed over the passions. And it is not possible to overlook the sovereignty of the
**7** intellect; for it conquered both suffering and pains.
**8** How then is it not fitting to acknowledge for these the mastery of excellent reason over the passions,
seeing that they were not turned aside from the pains through fire?
**9** For as towers [that serve as] breakwaters for harbors,
**10** cutting off the threats of the waves, do provide tranquility
**11** for those sailing into the haven; so the seven-towered excellent reason
**12** of the youths, having fortified the harbor of piety,
**13** did conquer the intemperance of the passions. For having formed a sacred chorus of piety,
**14** they exhorted one another, saying: "Let us die as brethren, O brethren, for the Law;
**15** let us imitate the three youths in Assyria,
**16** who scorned the equally mighty furnace. Let us not show cowardice
**17** in the demonstration of piety." And one, indeed, said, "Be of good courage, brother;"
**18** and another, "Endure nobly." And another, having called [it] to mind, said:
**19** "Remember whence ye are, or by whose father's hand Isaac endured to be sacrificed
**20** for the sake of piety." And each one individually, and all together looking upon one another,
**21** cheerful and exceedingly bold, said: "Let us consecrate ourselves to God
**22** with all our heart, unto Him that gave our souls,
**23** and let us offer our bodies for the keeping of the Law.
**24** Let us not fear him who seems to kill the body.
**25** For great is the struggle of the soul and the danger, lying in eternal torment
**26** for those who transgress the commandment of God. Let us therefore arm ourselves
