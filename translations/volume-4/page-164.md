τοὺς ἐν Ἰαμνείᾳ τὸν αὐτὸν ἐπιτελεῖν βουλομένους τρόπον τοῖς
κατοικοῦσιν Ἰουδαίοις, καὶ τοῖς Ἰαμνίταις νυκτὸς ἐπιβαλών, ὑφ' 9
ᾧ τὸν λιμένα σὺν τῷ στόλῳ, ὥστε ἐπιφαίνεσθαι τὰς αὐγὰς τοῦ
φέγγους εἰς τὰ Ἱεροσόλυμα, σταδίων ὄντων διακοσίων τεσσαράκοντα.
Ἐκεῖθεν δὲ ἀποσπασθέντων σταδίους ἐννέα, ποιουμένων 10
τὴν πορείαν ἐπὶ τὸν Τιμόθεον, ἐπέβαλλον Ἄραβες αὐτῷ οὐκ
ἐλάττους τῶν πεντακισχιλίων, ἱππεῖς δὲ πεντακόσιοι. Γενο- 11

τοῦ Θεοῦ βοήθειαν εὐημερησάντων, ἐλαττωθέντες οἱ Νομάδες
Ἄραβες ἠξίουν δοῦναι τὸν Ἰούδαν δέξιάν αὐτοῖς, ὑπισχνούμενοι
καὶ βοσκήματα δώσειν καὶ ἐν τοῖς λοιποῖς ὠφελήσειν αὐτούς. Ἰού- 12
δας δὲ ὑπολαβὼν ὡς ἀληθῶς ἐν πολλοῖς αὐτοὺς χρησίμους, ἐπε-

σκηνὰς αὐτῶν ἐχωρίσθησαν. Ἐπέβαλε δὲ καὶ ἐπί τινα πόλιν γε- 13

γωγότερον ἐχρῶντο, τοῖς περὶ τὸν Ἰούδαν λοιδοροῦντες καὶ προσέτι
βλασφημοῦντες καὶ λαλεῦντες, ἃ μὴ θέμις. Οἱ δὲ περὶ τὸν Ἰού- 15

**Chapter 12**

**8** ...those that were in Jamnia, purposing to deal in like manner with the Jews that dwelt among them, he fell also upon the Jamnites by night,
**9** and set fire to the harbour with the fleet, so that the beams of the light appeared even unto Jerusalem, it being two hundred and forty furlongs distant.
**10** And departing thence, when they had gone nine furlongs, as they were making their journey against Timothy, there fell upon him Arabs, no fewer than five thousand, and five hundred horsemen.
**11** And when there was a fierce battle, and those that were with Judas had prospered through the help of God, the Nomad Arabs, being vanquished, besought Judas to give them his right hand [of peace], promising that they would give him cattle, and assist him in all other things.
**12** But Judas, perceiving that they might indeed be profitable unto him in many things, granted to make peace with them; and when they had received pledges, they departed to their tents.
**13** Moreover, he fell upon a certain city of bridges, [which was] strong and encompassed with walls, and inhabited by sundry nations; its name was Caspin.
**14** But they that were within, trusting in the strength of their walls, and in the abundance of their provisions, behaved themselves more insolently, reviling those that were with Judas, and moreover blaspheming and speaking things which were not lawful.
**15** But those that were with Judas, having called upon the great Ruler of the world, who without battering rams and engines of war did cast down Jericho in the days of Joshua, did vigorously assault the wall.
**16** And having taken the city by the will of God, they made countless slaughter, insomuch that the adjacent lake, which was two furlongs broad, appeared to be filled with the blood that ran into it.
**17** And departing thence, they journeyed seven hundred and fifty furlongs, and came unto Charax, and unto the Jews called Tobiads.
**18** And Timothy indeed they found not in that place, for he had then withdrawn from those regions, having achieved nothing, but had left a garrison in a certain place which was very strong.
**19** But Dositheus and Sosipater, who were among the captains that were with Maccabeus, having made a sally, destroyed more than ten thousand men whom Timothy had left in the fortress.
**20** And Maccabeus, having ordered the army that was with him by companies, did set them over the companies, and marched against Timothy, who had about him an hundred and twenty thousand footmen, and three thousand (and) five hundred horsemen.
