2 δουμένῳ ἐν πᾶσι, καὶ ἔτι ἰσχύοντι ἐπιδέξασθαι τροφήν. Ὦ θάνα-
   τε καλόν σου τὸ κρῖμα ἐστὶν ἀνθρώπῳ ἐπιδεομένῳ καὶ ἐλασσου-
   μένῳ ἐν ἰσχύϊ, ἐσχατογήρῳ καὶ περισπωμένῳ περὶ πάντων, καὶ
   ἀπειθοῦντι καὶ ἀπωλωλεκότι ὑπομονήν.
3 Μὴ εὐλαβοῦ κρῖμα θανάτου μνήσθητι προτέρων σου καὶ ἐσχάτων.
4 Τοῦτο κρῖμα παρὰ Κυρίου πάσῃ σαρκί· καὶ τί ἀπαναίνῃ ἐν εὐδοκίᾳ
   ὑψίστου; εἴτε δέκα, εἴτε ἑκατόν, εἴτε χίλια ἔτη, οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν ᾅδου
   ἔλεγχος ζωῆς.
5 Τέκνα βδελυρὰ γίνεται τέκνα ἁμαρτωλῶν, καὶ συναναστρεφόμενα
   παροικίαις ἀσεβῶν·
6 τέκνων ἁμαρτωλῶν ἀπολεῖται κληρονομία, καὶ μετὰ τοῦ σπέρματος
   αὐτῶν ἐνδελεχίει ὄνειδος.
7 Πατρὶ ἀσεβεῖ μέμφεται τέκνα, ὅτι δι᾽ αὐτὸν ὀνειδισθήσονται.
8 Οὐχὶ ὑμῖν ἄνδρες ἀσεβεῖς, οἵτινες ἐγκατελείπετε νόμον Θεοῦ
   ὑψίστου· ἐὰν γὰρ πληθυνθῆτε, εἰς ἀπώλειαν,
9 (καὶ ἐὰν γεννηθῆτε, εἰς κατάραν γεννηθήσεσθε) καὶ ἐὰν ἀποθάνητε,
   εἰς κατάραν μερισθήσεσθε.
10 Πάντα ὅσα ἐκ γῆς, εἰς γῆν ἀπελεύσεται· οὕτως ἀσεβεῖς ἀπὸ
    κατάρα-εις ἀπώλειαν.
11 Πένθος ἀνθρώπων ἐν σώματι αὐτῶν ὄνομα δὲ (ἁμαρτωλῶν) οὐκ
    ἀγαθὸν ἐξαλειφθήσεται.
12 Φρόντισον περὶ ὀνόματος, αὐτὸ γάρ σοι διαμένει ἢ χίλιοι μεγάλοι
    θησαυροὶ χρυσίου·
13 ἀγαθῆς ζωῆς ἀριθμὸς ἡμερῶν, καὶ ἀγαθὸν ὄνομα εἰς αἰῶνα
    διαμένει.
14 Παιδείαν ἐν εἰρήνῃ συντηρήσατε τέκνα· σοφία δὲ κεκρυμμένη καὶ
    θησαυρὸς ἀφανής, τίς ὠφέλεια ἐν ἀμφοτέροις;
15 Κρείσσων ἄνθρωπος ἀποκρύπτων τὴν μωρίαν αὐτοῦ, ἢ ἄνθρωπος
    ἀποκρύπτων τὴν σοφίαν αὐτοῦ.
16 Τοιγαροῦν ἐντράπητε ἐπὶ τῷ ῥήματι μου· οὐ γὰρ ἔστι πᾶσαν
    αἰσχύνην διαφυλάξαι καλόν, καὶ οὐ πάντα πᾶσιν ἐν πίστει
    εὐδοκιμεῖται.
17 Αἰσχύνεσθε ἀπὸ πατρὸς καὶ μητρὸς περὶ πορνείας, καὶ ἀπὸ
    ἡγουμένου καὶ δυνάστου περὶ ψεύδους,
18 ἀπὸ κριτοῦ καὶ ἄρχοντος περὶ πλημμελείας, ἀπὸ συναγωγῆς καὶ
    λαοῦ περὶ ἀνομίας, ἀπὸ κοινωνοῦ καὶ φίλου περὶ ἀδικίας, καὶ ἀπὸ
    τόπου οὗ παροικεῖς περὶ κλοπῆς,
19 καὶ ἀπὸ λήθης Θεοῦ καὶ διαθήκης, ἀπὸ πήξεως ἀγκῶνος ἐπ᾽ ἄρτοις,
    καὶ ἀπὸ σκορακισμοῦ λήψεως καὶ δόσεως,
20 καὶ ἀπὸ ἀσπαζομένων περὶ σιωπῆς, καὶ ἀπὸ δράσεως γυναικὸς
    ἑταίρας,
21 καὶ ἀπὸ ἀποστροφῆς προσώπου συγγενοῦς, ἀπὸ ἀφαιρέσεως
    μερίδος καὶ δόσεως,
22 ἀπὸ κατανοήσεως γυναικὸς ὑπάρχου, ἀπὸ περιεργείας παιδίσκης
    αὐτοῦ, καὶ μὴ ἐπισπῆς ἐπὶ τὴν κοίτην αὐτῆς· ἀπὸ φίλων περὶ
    λόγου ὀνειδισμοῦ, καὶ μετὰ τὸ δοῦναι μὴ ὀνείδιζε·
23 ἀπὸ δευτερώσεως (καὶ) λόγου ἀκοῆς, καὶ ἀπὸ ἀποκαλύψεως λόγων
    κρυφίων· καὶ ἔσῃ αἰσχυντηρὸς ἀληθινῶς, καὶ εὑρίσκων χάριν
    ἔναντι παντὸς ἀνθρώπου.

**Chapter Forty-One**

prospering in all things, and yet strong to receive nourishment.
O Death, good is thy judgment unto a man that is in want,
and diminished in strength, utterly aged and distracted concerning all things,
and disobedient, and having lost patience.
3 Fear thou not the judgment of death; remember thy forerunners and thy successors.
4 This is the judgment from the Lord upon all flesh; and why dost thou shrink from the good pleasure of the Most High?
Whether ten, or a hundred, or a thousand years, there is no reproof of life in Hades.
5 Abominable children become the children of sinners, and they consort with the dwellings of the ungodly.
6 The inheritance of the children of sinners shall perish, and with their seed, reproach shall cling unceasingly.
7 The children shall blame an ungodly father, because for his sake shall they be reproached.
8 Is it not to you, O ungodly men, who have forsaken the law of God Most High?
For if ye be multiplied, it shall be unto perdition;
9 and if ye be born, unto a curse shall ye be born; and if ye die, unto a curse shall ye be apportioned.
10 All things that are from the earth shall go to the earth; so the ungodly [shall pass] from curse-unto perdition.
11 The mourning of men is in their bodies; but the name (of sinners), [being] not good, shall be blotted out.
12 Be mindful of thy name, for it abideth with thee more than a thousand great treasures of gold.
13 The number of days of a good life [is fleeting], yet a good name abideth unto eternity.
14 Preserve instruction in peace, O children; but hidden wisdom and an unseen treasure, what profit is there in both?
15 Better is a man that hideth his folly, than a man that hideth his wisdom.
16 Therefore be heedful of my word; for it is not good to avoid all shame, and not all things are approved by all men in faithfulness.
17 Be ye ashamed before father and mother concerning fornication; and before a leader and a ruler concerning falsehood;
18 before a judge and a magistrate concerning a transgression; before a congregation and a people concerning lawlessness;
before a partner and a friend concerning injustice; and before the place where thou sojournest concerning theft;
19 and concerning the forgetfulness of God and of the covenant; concerning the resting of [thy] elbow upon loaves [of bread];
and concerning the rejection of receiving and of giving;
20 and before those who greet [thee] concerning [thy] silence; and concerning the beholding of a harlot woman;
21 and concerning the turning away of the face of a kinsman; concerning the taking away of a portion and of giving;
22 from observing the wife of a neighbor; from prying into his maidservant, and stretch not thyself out upon her bed;
from friends concerning a word of reproach; and after having given, do not reproach;
23 from the repetition (and) of a word heard; and from the revealing of secret words; and thou shalt be truly modest, and find favor before every man.
