    τοῦ· καὶ ἐνεδύσατο θώρακα ὡς γίγας, καὶ συνεζώσατο τὰ σκεύη
    τὰ πολεμικὰ αὐτοῦ, καὶ πολέμους συνεστήσατο σκεπάζων παρεμβολὴν ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ.
    4 Καὶ ὡμοιώθη λέοντι ἐν τοῖς ἔργοις αὐτοῦ,
    5 καὶ ὡς σκύμνος ἐρευγόμενος εἰς θήραν. Καὶ ἐδίωξεν ἀνόμους
    ἐξερευνῶν, καὶ τοὺς ταράσσοντας τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ ἐφλόγισε,
    6 καὶ συνεστάλησαν οἱ ἄνομοι ἀπὸ τοῦ φόβου αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντες οἱ
    ἐργάται τῆς ἀνομίας συνεταράχθησαν, καὶ εὐωδώθη σωτηρία ἐν
    7 χειρὶ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐπίκρανε βασιλεῖς πολλοὺς, καὶ ηὔφρανε τὸν
    Ἰακὼβ ἐν τοῖς ἔργοις αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἕως τοῦ αἰῶνος τὸ μνημόσυνον
    8 αὐτοῦ εἰς εὐλογίαν. Καὶ διῆλθεν ἐν πόλεσιν Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐξωλέθρευσεν ἀσεβεῖς ἐξ αὐτῆς, καὶ ἀπέστρεψεν ὀργὴν ἀπὸ Ἰσραήλ.
    9 Καὶ ὠνομάσθη ἕως ἐσχάτου τῆς γῆς, καὶ συνήγαγεν ἀπολλυμένους.
    10 Καὶ συνήγαγεν Ἀπολλώνιος ἔθνη, καὶ ἀπὸ Σαμαρείας δύναμιν
    11 μεγάλην τοῦ πολεμῆσαι πρὸς Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἔγνω Ἰούδας, καὶ ἐξῆλθεν εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτῷ, καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτὸν, καὶ ἀπέκτεινεν·
    12 καὶ ἔπεσον τραυματίαι πολλοὶ, καὶ οἱ ἐπίλοιποι ἔφυγον. Καὶ ἔλαβεν τὰ σκεύη αὐτῶν, καὶ τὴν μάχαιραν Ἀπολλωνίου ἔλαβεν Ἰούδας,
    13 καὶ ἦν πολεμῶν ἐν αὐτῇ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας. Καὶ ἤκουσε Σήρων ὁ ἄρχων τῆς δυνάμεως Συρίας, ὅτι ἠθροισεν Ἰούδας ἄθροισμα,
    14 καὶ ἐκκλησίαν πιστῶν μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐκπορευομένων εἰς πόλεμον.
    Καὶ εἶπε· ποιήσω ἐμαυτῷ ὄνομα, καὶ δοξασθήσομαι ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ,
    15 καὶ πολεμήσω τὸν Ἰούδαν καὶ τοὺς σὺν αὐτῷ, καὶ τοὺς ἐξουδενοῦντας τὸν λόγον τοῦ βασιλέως. Καὶ προσέθετο τοῦ ἀναβῆναι·
    16 καὶ ἀνέβη μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ παρεμβολὴ ἀσεβῶν ἰσχυρὰ βοηθῆσαι αὐτῷ,
    καὶ ποιῆσαι τὴν ἐκδίκησιν ἐν υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἤγγισεν ἕως ἀναβάσεως Βαιθορὼν·
    17 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Ἰούδας εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτῷ ὀλιγοστός. Ὡς δὲ ἴδον τὴν παρεμβολὴν ἐρχομένην εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτοῖς, εἶπαν τῷ Ἰούδᾳ·
    τί δυνησόμεθα ὀλιγοστοὶ ὄντες πολεμῆσαι πρὸς πλῆθος τοσοῦτο ἰσχυρόν;
    18 καὶ ἡμεῖς ἐκλελύμεθα ἀσιτοῦντες σήμερον. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰούδας· εὔκοπόν ἐστι συγκλεισθῆναι πολλοὺς ἐν χερσὶν ὀλίγων·
    19 καὶ οὐκ ἔστι διαφορὰ ἐναντίον τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ σώζειν ἐν πολλοῖς ἢ ἐν ὀλίγοις. Ὅτι οὐκ ἐν πλήθει δυνάμεως νίκη πολέμου ἐστίν, ἀλλ᾿ ἡ ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ
    20 ἰσχύς. Αὐτὶ ἔρχονται πρὸς ἡμᾶς ἐν πλήθει ὕβρεως καὶ ἀνομίας,
    τοῦ ἐξᾶραι ἡμᾶς καὶ τὰς γυναῖκας ἡμῶν καὶ τὰ τέκνα ἡμῶν, τοῦ
    21 σκυλεῦσαι ἡμᾶς. Ἡμεῖς δὲ πολεμοῦμεν περὶ τῶν ψυχῶν ἡμῶν

    **Chapter 3**

    **3** his. And he put on a breastplate as a giant, and girded himself with his implements of war, and waged wars, shielding the encampment with his sword.
    **4** And he was likened unto a lion in his deeds,
    **5** and as a lion's whelp roaring for prey. And he pursued the lawless, searching them out, and those who troubled his people he consumed with fire,
    **6** and the lawless were dismayed by his fear, and all the workers of lawlessness were confounded, and salvation prospered in
    **7** his hand. And he embittered many kings, and gladdened Jacob by his deeds, and unto the age of ages his memorial shall be for a blessing.
    **8** And he passed through the cities of Judah, and utterly destroyed the impious ones from them, and turned away wrath from Israel.
    **9** And his name was renowned unto the uttermost part of the earth, and he gathered together those who were perishing.
    **10** And Apollonius gathered nations, and from Samaria a great force
    **11** to make war against Israel. And Judas knew [of it], and he went forth to meet him, and he smote him, and slew him;
    **12** and many wounded men fell, and the remnant fled. And he took their armor, and the sword of Apollonius, Judas took,
    **13** and he fought with it all his days. And Seron, the commander of the force of Syria, heard that Judas had gathered a host,
    **14** and an assembly of faithful men with him, and those going forth to war. And he said, "I shall make a name for myself, and I shall be glorified in the kingdom,
    **15** and I shall fight against Judas and those who are with him, and those who despise the word of the king." And he prepared to go up;
    **16** and there went up with him a mighty encampment of impious men to help him, and to execute vengeance on the sons of Israel. And he drew near unto the ascent of Beth-horon;
    **17** and Judas went forth to meet him, a small number. But when they saw the encampment coming to meet them, they said unto Judas, "How shall we, being so few, be able to fight against such a great and mighty multitude?
    **18** And we are faint, having eaten nothing today." And Judas said, "It is easy for many to be shut up in the hands of few;
    **19** and there is no difference before the God of heaven to save by many or by few. For the victory of war is not in the multitude of the army, but the strength is from heaven.
    **20** Behold, they come against us in a multitude of insolence and lawlessness, to root out us and our wives and our children, to
    **21** plunder us. But we fight for our lives
