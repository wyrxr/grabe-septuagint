**ΚΕΦ. Ε´. V.**
**12** ἀνελύθη, ὡς ἀγνοῆται τὴν δίοδον αὑτοῦ· οὕτως καὶ ἡμεῖς γεννηθέντες
**13** ἐξελείπομεν, καὶ ἀρετῆς μὲν σημεῖον οὐδὲν ἔσχομεν δεῖξαι, ἐν δὲ τῇ
κακίᾳ ἡμῶν κατεδαπανήθημεν.
**14** Ὅτι ἐλπὶς ἀσεβοῦς ὡς φερόμενος χνοῦς ὑπὸ ἀνέμου, καὶ ὡς πάχνη
**15** ὑπὸ λαίλαπος διωχθεῖσα λεπτή, καὶ ὡς καπνὸς ὑπὸ ἀνέμου διεχύθη, καὶ
ὡς μνεία καταλύτου μονοημέρου παρώδευσε.
**16** Δίκαιοι δὲ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα ζῶσι, καὶ ἐν Κυρίῳ ὁ μισθὸς αὐτῶν, καὶ
ἡ φροντὶς αὐτῶν παρὰ Ὑψίστῳ·
**17** διὰ τοῦτο λήψονται τὸ βασίλειον τῆς εὐπρεπείας, καὶ τὸ διάδημα
τοῦ κάλλους ἐκ χειρὸς Κυρίου· ὅτι τῇ δεξιᾷ σκεπάσει αὐτούς, καὶ τῷ
βραχίονι ὑπερασπιεῖ αὐτῶν.
**18** Λήψεται πανοπλίαν τὸν ζῆλον αὑτοῦ, καὶ ὁπλοποιήσει τὴν κτίσιν εἰς
ἄμυναν ἐχθρῶν·
**19** ἐνδύσεται θώρακα δικαιοσύνην, καὶ περιθήσεται κόρυθα κρίσιν
ἀνυπόκριτον·
**20** λήψεται ἀσπίδα ἀκαταμάχητον ὁσιότητα, ὀξυνεῖ δὲ ἀπότομον ὀργὴν
εἰς ῥομφαίαν.
**21** Συνεκπολεμήσει δὲ αὑτῷ ὁ κόσμος ἐπὶ τοὺς παράφρονας· πορεύσονται
**22** εὔστοχοι βολίδες ἀστραπῶν, καὶ ὡς ἀπὸ εὐκύκλου τόξου τῶν νεφῶν
ἐπὶ σκοπὸν ἁλοῦνται·
**23** καὶ ἐκ πετροβόλου θυμοῦ πλήρεις ῥιφήσονται χάλαζαι· ἀγανακτήσει
κατ᾿ αὐτῶν ὕδωρ θαλάσσης, ποταμοὶ δὲ συγκλύσουσιν ἀποτόμως·
**24** ἀντιστήσεται αὐτοῖς πνεῦμα δυνάμεως, καὶ ὡς λαῖλαψ ἐκλικμήσει αὐτούς·
καὶ ἐρημώσει πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν ἀνομία, καὶ ἡ κακοπραγία περιτρέψει
θρόνους δυναστῶν.

**ΚΕΦ. Ϛ´. VI.**

**1** ΑΚΟΥΣΑΤΕ οὖν βασιλεῖς καὶ σύνετε, μάθετε δικασαὶ περάτων γῆς·
**2** ἐνωτίσασθε οἱ κρατοῦντες πλήθους καὶ γεγαυρωμένοι ἐπὶ ὄχλοις ἐθνῶν.
**3** Ὅτι ἐδόθη παρὰ Κυρίου ἡ κράτησις ὑμῖν, καὶ ἡ δυναστεία παρὰ
ὑψίστου,
**4** ὃς ἐξετάσει ὑμῶν τὰ ἔργα, καὶ τὰς βουλὰς διερευνήσει·
**5** ὅτι ὑπηρέται ὄντες τῆς αὑτοῦ βασιλείας, οὐκ ἐκρίνατε ὀρθῶς, οὐδὲ
ἐφυλάξατε νόμον, οὐδὲ κατὰ τὴν βουλὴν τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐπορεύθητε.
**6** Φρικτῶς καὶ ταχέως ἐπιστήσεται ὑμῖν· ὅτι κρίσις ἀπότομος ἐν τοῖς
ὑπερέχουσι γίνεται.
**7** Ὁ γὰρ ἐλάχιστος συγγνωστὸς ἔστιν ἐλέου· δυνατοὶ δὲ δυνατῶς
ἐτασθήσονται.
**8** Οὐ γὰρ ὑποστελεῖται πρόσωπον ὁ πάντων δεσπότης, οὐδὲ ἐντραπήσεται
μέγεθος· ὅτι μικρὸν καὶ μέγαν αὐτὸς ἐποίησεν, ὁμοίως τε προνοεῖ περὶ
πάντων·
**9** τοῖς δὲ κραταιοῖς ἰσχυρὰ

**CHAPTER V.**

**12** returneth into itself, so that its passage is not known.
**13** Thus also we, having been born, have faded away, and no sign of virtue had we to show forth, but in our wickedness were we utterly consumed.
**14** For the hope of the ungodly is as down that is driven by the wind,
**15** and as a thin hoarfrost chased by a tempest, and as smoke scattered by the wind, and as the remembrance of a sojourner for but a day that hath passed by.
**16** But the righteous live forevermore, and in the Lord is their reward, and their solicitude is with the Most High.
**17** Therefore shall they receive the kingdom of splendor, and the diadem of beauty from the hand of the Lord; for with His right hand shall He shelter them, and with His arm shall He shield them.
**18** He shall take for His complete armor His zeal, and shall make creation His weapon for the defense of His foes.
**19** He shall put on righteousness as a breastplate, and shall wear unfeigned judgment as a helmet.
**20** He shall take unconquerable holiness as a shield, and shall sharpen His swift wrath as a sword.
**21** And the world itself shall war with Him against the senseless.
**22** Then shall the well-aimed bolts of lightning issue forth, and as from a well-drawn bow of the clouds shall they fly straight to the mark;
**23** and full hailstones, from the catapult of [His] wrath, shall be hurled down. The waters of the sea shall surge against them in fury, and the rivers shall overwhelm them with sudden force.
**24** The Spirit of Power shall rise up against them, and as a tempest shall It winnow them; and lawlessness shall lay waste the whole earth, and wickedness shall cast down the thrones of potentates.

**CHAPTER VI.**

**1** Hearken therefore, O ye kings, and understand; learn, O ye judges of the earth's farthest bounds;
**2** Give ear, ye that rule over multitudes, and boast yourselves in the throngs of nations.
**3** For from the Lord was your dominion given unto you, and your sovereignty from the Most High,
**4** Who shall examine your works, and diligently search out your counsels.
**5** Because, being servants of His kingdom, ye judged not aright, neither observed ye the Law, nor walked according to the counsel of God.
**6** With dread and swiftness shall He come upon you; for a sharp judgment is reserved for them that are in high places.
**7** For the lowliest [among men] shall be excused by mercy; but the mighty shall be mightily scrutinised.
**8** For the Lord over all shall not regard any man's person, nor shall He be abashed by any greatness; for He Himself hath made both the small and the great, and alike doth He care for all;
**9** but a grievous trial awaiteth the powerful.
