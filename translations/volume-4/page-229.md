9 ἱερεῖς ἀπὸ τῶν Θεῶν αὐτῶν χρυσίον καὶ ἀργύριον εἰς ἑαυτοὺς καταναλώσουσι,
10 δώσουσι δὲ ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν καὶ ταῖς ἐπὶ τοῦ τέγους πόρναις· κοσμοῦσι δὲ αὐτούς, ὡς ἀνθρώπους, τοῖς ἐνδύμασι, Θεοὺς
11 χρυσοῦς καὶ ἀργυροῦς, καὶ ξυλίνους. Οὗτοι δὲ οὐ διασώζονται ἀπὸ ἰοῦ καὶ βρωμάτων, περιβεβλημένων αὐτῶν ἱματισμὸν πορφυροῦν.
12 Ἐκμάσσονται τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτῶν διὰ τὸν ἐκ τῆς οἰκίας
13 κονιορτόν, ὃς ἐστὶ πλείων ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῖς. Καὶ σκῆπτρον ἔχει ὡς ἄνθρωπος κριτὴς χώρας, ὃς τὸν εἰς αὐτὸν ἁμαρτάνοντα οὐκ ἀνελεῖ.
14 Ἔχει δὲ ἐγχειρίδιον ἐν τῇ δεξιᾷ, καὶ πέλεκυν· ἑαυτὸν δὲ ἐκ πολέμων καὶ λῃστῶν οὐκ ἐξελεῖται· ὅθεν γνώριμοί εἰσιν οὐκ
15 ὄντες Θεοί· μὴ οὖν φοβηθῆτε αὐτούς. Ὥσπερ γὰρ σκεῦος ἀνθρώπου συντριβὲν ἄχρηστον γίνεται, τοιοῦτοι ὑπάρχουσιν οἱ Θεοὶ αὐ-
16 τῶν, καθηιδρυμένων αὐτῶν ἐν τοῖς οἴκοις· οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτῶν πλήρεις εἰσὶ κονιορτοῦ ἀπὸ τῶν ποδῶν τῶν εἰσπορευομένων.
17 Καὶ ὥσπερ τινὶ ἠδικηκότι βασιλέα περιπεφραγμέναι εἰσὶν αἱ αὐλαί, ἢ ὡς ἐπὶ θανάτῳ ἀπηγμένῳ, τοὺς οἴκους αὐτῶν ὀχυροῦσιν οἱ ἱερεῖς αὐτῶν θυρώμασί τε καὶ κλείθροις καὶ μεγάλοις, ἔπως μὴ ὑπὸ τῶν
18 λῃστῶν συληθῶσι. Λύχνους καίουσι, καὶ πλείονας αὐτοῖς, ὧν
19 οὐδένα δύνανται ἰδεῖν. Ἔστι δὲ ὥσπερ δοκὸς τῶν ἐκ τῆς οἰκίας, τὰς δὲ καρδίας αὐτῶν φασιν ἐκλείχεσθαι τῶν ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς ἑρπετῶν, κατεσθόντων αὐτούς τε καὶ τὸν ἱματισμὸν αὐτῶν οὐκ αἰσθάνονται.
20 Μεμελανωμένοι τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτῶν, ἀπὸ τοῦ καπνοῦ τοῦ
21 ἐκ τῆς οἰκίας καιομένου· ἐπὶ τὸ σῶμα αὐτῶν καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτῶν ἐφίπτανται χελιδόνες καὶ νυκτερίδες, καὶ τὰ ὄρνεα,
22 ὡσαύτως δὲ καὶ οἱ αἴλουροι, ὅθεν γνώσεσθε, ὅτι οὐκ εἰσὶ Θεοί· μὴ οὖν φοβηθῆτε αὐτά.
23 Τὸ γὰρ χρυσίον ὃ περικεῖνται εἰς κάλλος, ἐὰν μή τις ἐκμάξῃ τὸν ἰόν, οὐ μὴ στίλψωσιν, οὐδὲ γὰρ ἔτι
24 ἐχωνεύοντο· ἠσθάνοντο; Ἐκ πάσης τιμῆς ἠγορασμένα ἐστὶν,
25 ἐν οἷς οὐκ ἐστὶ πνεῦμα. Ἄνευ ποδῶν ἐπ᾿ ὤμοις αἴρονται ἐνδεικνύμενοι τὴν ἑαυτῶν ἀτιμίαν τοῖς ἀνθρώποις,
26 αἰσχύνονται δὲ καὶ οἱ θεραπεύοντες αὐτά, διὰ τὸ, εἴποτε ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν πέσῃ, μὴ δι᾿ ἑαυτῶν ἀνίστασθαι· μήτε ἐάν τις αὐτὸ ὀρθὸν στήσῃ, δι᾿ ἑαυτοῦ κινηθήσεται, μήτε ἐὰν κλιθῇ, οὐ μὴ ὀρθωθῇ,
27 ἀλλὰ ὥσπερ νεκροῖς τὰ δῶρα αὐτοῖς παρατίθεται, τὰς δὲ θυσίας αὐτῶν ἀποδόμενοι οἱ ἱερεῖς αὐτῶν καταχρῶνται· ὡσαύτως δὲ καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες αὐτῶν ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν ταριχεύουσι οὔτε πτωχῷ οὔτε ἀδυνάτῳ μετα-

**CHAPTER I.**

**9** the priests from their gods the gold and the silver do consume for themselves;
**10** and of these things they shall give also unto the harlots upon the roofs. And they adorn these [idols], as [one would] men, with garments, even gods
**11** of gold and of silver, and of wood. But these are not preserved from rust and decay, though they be clad in raiment of purple.
**12** Their faces are wiped clean from the dust of the house,
**13** which is abundant upon them. And each holdeth a scepter, as a man [who is] a judge of the land, yet cannot slay him that trespasseth against him.
**14** Yea, he hath a dagger in his right hand, and an axe; but himself he cannot deliver from wars and robbers.
**15** Whereby it is known that they are no gods; fear them not, therefore. For as a vessel of a man, when it is broken, becometh useless,
**16** such likewise are their gods, though they be established in their houses. Their eyes are full of dust from the feet of those that enter in.
**17** And like as a man that hath offended a king hath his courts hedged about, or as one led forth to suffer death, so do their priests fortify their houses with doors and with bolts and with great bars,
**18** lest they be plundered by robbers. They burn lamps, and many for them,
**19** of which they are not able to see one. And they are like unto a beam from out of the house, and of their hearts, it is said that they are licked away by the creeping things of the earth, which consume both them and their garments, yet they perceive it not.
**20** Their faces are blackened from the smoke of the fire burned in the house;
**21** upon their bodies and upon their heads do swallows and bats and birds light,
**22** and likewise also the cats. Whereby ye shall know that they are no gods; fear them not, therefore.
**23** For the gold which they wear for adornment, if a man wipe not away the rust, they will not shine,
**24** for they were not yet melted down; Did they perceive? [These things] are bought at every price,
**25** in whom there is no breath. Without feet, they are borne upon shoulders, showing forth their own dishonor unto men;
**26** and they that serve them are ashamed, because if ever one falleth to the ground, it cannot rise up of itself; nor if one set it upright, will it move of itself; nor if it be tilted, will it set itself upright;
**27** but as unto the dead are gifts laid before them. And their priests, having sold their sacrifices, do consume [the proceeds]; and likewise also their wives do cure [food] from them, yet neither to the poor nor to the helpless do they impart
