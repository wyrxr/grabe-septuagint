χει κατὰ τοῦ γένους ἀνθρώποις συμφρονοῦσιν εἰς κακοποίησιν,
ἀφορμῆς δεδιδομένης εἰς διάθεσιν, ὡς ἂν ἀπὸ τῶν νομίμων αὑτοὺς
κωλυόντων. Οἱ δὲ Ἰουδαῖοι τὴν μὲν πρὸς τοὺς βασιλεῖς εὔνοιαν 3
καὶ πίστιν ἀδιάστροφον ἦσαν διαφυλάσσοντες. Σεβόμενοι δὲ τὸν 4
Θεόν, καὶ τῷ τούτου νόμῳ πολιτευόμενοι, χωρισμὸν ἐποίουν
ἐπί τινων καὶ καταστροφάς· δι᾽ ἣν αἰτίαν ἐνίοις ἀπεχθεῖς ἐφαί-

φήν, ἅπασιν ἀνθρώποις εὐδόκιμοι καθειστήκεισαν. Τὴν μὲν οὖν 6

ροῦντες, καὶ συνδρομὰς ἀπροσκόπους γινομένας, βοηθεῖν μὲν οὐκ
ἔσθανον τυραννικὴ γὰρ ἦν ἡ διάθεσις· παρεκάλουν δὲ καὶ δυσ-
φόρως εἶχον, καὶ μεταπεσεῖσθαι ταῦτα ὑπελάμβανον. Μὴ γὰρ 9

**III Maccabees, Chapter 3**

**2** And as these matters were being arranged, a malicious rumour went forth against the nation, [spread] by men who were of one mind for wickedness, occasion being given for [their evil] disposition, as though they did hinder themselves from the [king's] laws.
**3** Now the Jews, for their part, had preserved an unswerving goodwill and loyalty toward the kings.
**4** But reverencing God, and living by His law, they did make a separation concerning certain matters and [did cause] the overthrow [of some customs]; for which cause they appeared hateful unto some.
**5** And adorning their common life with righteous deeds, they had become well-esteemed by all men.
**6** Now the good conduct of the nation, which was famed among all men,
**7** the foreigners did in no wise regard; but they did spread abroad rumours concerning the divergence in [matters of] worship and of food, saying that these men had become neither allies to the king nor to the [governing] powers, but were hostile and did greatly oppose the state; and they were led about by no common fear.
**8** But the Greeks in the city, having suffered no wrong, seeing an unexpected commotion against these men, and unhindered assaults being made [upon them], did not deem it meet to help, for the disposition [of the king] was tyrannical; but they did exhort [themselves to patience] and were in distress, and did suppose that these things would change.
**9** For it was not [fitting], they thought, that so great a body [of people] should be thus violently coerced, having committed no offense.
**10** And already some neighbours and friends, and those who shared in their commerce, secretly winning over others, did give assurances to stand together, and to stir up every earnest effort for their succour.
**11** Now he, being puffed up by his present prosperity, and not perceiving the might of the Most Great God, but supposing that he should perpetually remain in the same [prosperous] state, did write this letter against them:
**12** "King Ptolemy Philopator, to the generals and soldiers throughout Egypt, and in every place, greeting and [wishing you] health.
**13** And I myself and our affairs are in good health.
**14** Concerning the expedition which we made into Asia, whereof ye yourselves are aware, as it was brought to an excellent end by the unwavering alliance of the gods with us, and by our own strength, as was fitting,
**15** we judged it right not by the violence of the spear, but by clemency and great humanity, to cherish the nations dwelling in Coele-Syria and Phoenicia, and to do them good gladly.
**16** And having assigned many revenues to the temples throughout the cities, we were led also to ascend unto Jerusalem, to honour the temple."
