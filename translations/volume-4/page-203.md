ἀλγηδόνων ἐπιδείκνυμι κεκρατηκέναι τὸν λογισμόν, ἀλλὰ καὶ τῶν
ἡδονῶν κρατεῖν, μηδὲ αὐταῖς ὑπείκειν.

ΚΕΦ. Ζ´. VII.

1 ὭΣΠΕΡ καὶ ἄριστος κυβερνήτης ὁ τοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν Ἐλεαζάρου λογισμός, πηδαλιουχῶν τὴν τῆς εὐσεβείας ναῦν ἐν τῷ τῶν
2 παθῶν πελάγει, καὶ καταικιζόμενος ταῖς τοῦ τυράννου ἀπειλαῖς
3 καὶ καταντλούμενος ταῖς τῶν βασάνων τρικυμίαις, κατ᾽ οὐδένα
τρόπον μετέτρεφε τοὺς τῆς εὐσεβείας οἴακας, ἕως οὗ ἔπλευσεν
4 ἐπὶ τὸν τῆς ἀθανάτου νίκης λιμένα. Οὔχ οὕτως πόλις πολλοῖς
καὶ ποικίλοις μηχανήμασιν ἀντέσχεν ποτὲ πολιορκουμένη, ὡς ὁ
πανάγιος Ἐλεάζαρος τὴν ἱερὰν ψυχὴν αἰκισμοῖς τε καὶ στρέβλαις
πυρπολούμενος, ἐκίνησε τοὺς πολιορκοῦντας, διὰ τὸν ὑπερασπί-
5 ζοντα τῆς εὐσεβείας λογισμόν. Ὥσπερ γὰρ πρόκρημνον ἄκραν,
τὴν ἑαυτοῦ διάνοιαν ὁ πατὴρ Ἐλεάζαρος ἐκτείνας, περιέκλασεν
6 τοὺς μαινομένους τῶν παθῶν κλύδωνας. Ὦ ἄξιε τῆς ἱερωσύνης ἱερεῦ, οὐκ ἐμίγας τοὺς ἱεροὺς ὀδόντας, οὐδὲ τὴν θεοσέβειαν
καὶ καθαρισμὸν νόμιμον χωρήσασαν γαστέρα ἐκοινώνησας μιαρο-
7. 8 φαγίᾳ. Ὦ σύμφωνε νόμου, καὶ φιλόσοφε θείου βίου. Τοιούτους δὴ δεῖ εἶναι τοὺς ἱερουργοῦντας τὸν νόμον ἰδίῳ αἵματι, καὶ
9 γενναίῳ ἱδρῶτι τοῖς μέχρι θανάτου πάθεσιν ὑπερασπίζοντας. Σὺ
πάτερ, τὴν εὐνομίαν ἡμῶν διὰ τῶν ὑπομονῶν εἰς δόξαν ἐκύρωσας,
καὶ τὴν ἁγίαν σεμνολογήσας οὐ κατέλυσας, καὶ διὰ τῶν ἔργων ἐπισημοποίησας τοὺς τῆς θείας φιλοσοφίας λόγους. Ὦ βασάνων βιαιότερε γέρων, καὶ πυρὸς εὐτονώτερε πρεσβῦτα, καὶ παθῶν μέγιστε βασιλεῦ Ἐλεάζαρε. Ὥσπερ γὰρ ὁ πατὴρ Ἀαρὼν
τῷ θυμιατηρίῳ καθωπλισμένος, διὰ τοῦ ἐθνοπλήκτου πυρὸς ἐπι-
12 τρέχων τὸν ἐμπυρισμὸν ἐνίκησεν ἄγγελον. Οὕτως δ᾽ Ἀαρωνίδης
Ἐλεάζαρος διὰ τοῦ πυρὸς ὑπερτηκόμενος οὐ μετετράπη τὸν λο-
13 γισμόν. Καίτοι τὸ θαυμασιώτατον, γέρων ὤν, λελυμένων μὲν ἤδη τῶν τοῦ σώματος τόνων, καὶ περικεχαλασμένων δὲ τῶν σαρκῶν, κεχηκότων δὲ καὶ τῶν νεύρων, ἀνενέγκων. Τῷ πνεύματι
τοῦ λογισμοῦ, καὶ τῷ Ἰσραείῳ λογισμῷ τὴν πολυκέφαλον στρέβλαν ἠκύρωσεν. Ὦ μακαρίου γήρως, καὶ σεμνῆς πολιᾶς, καὶ βίου
16 νομίμου, ὃν πιστὴ θανάτου σφραγὶς ἐτελείωσεν. Εἰ δὲ τοίνυν γέρων

**CHAPTER VI.**

**35** ...it is laughable; and not only over external pains, [but] I demonstrate that reason hath prevailed; it doth also rule over pleasures, neither yielding unto them.

**CHAPTER VII.**

**1** As indeed an excellent pilot was the reason of our father Eleazar, steering the ship of godliness in the sea of passions,
**2** and being tormented by the tyrant's threats and overwhelmed by the surging waves of tortures,
**3** in no wise did he turn the rudders of godliness, until he sailed into the harbor of immortal victory.
**4** Not thus did a city besieged with many and diverse engines of war ever resist, as the most holy Eleazar, his sacred soul being set on fire by tortures and racks,
**5** did move those who laid siege against him, by reason of the reason that defended godliness. For as a precipitous cliff, so did our father Eleazar stretch forth his mind, and break the raging waves of the passions.
**6** O worthy priest of the priesthood, thou didst not defile thy sacred teeth, nor didst thou bring thy belly, which held godliness and lawful purification, into communion with defilement by eating.
**7** O harmonizer with the Law, and philosopher of the divine life!
**8** Such indeed must be they who minister the Law with their own blood,
**9** and with noble sweat defend it against sufferings even unto death. Thou, O father, didst establish our good order [of life] through thy endurance unto glory, and having glorified the holy [Law], thou didst not abolish [it],
**10** and through thy deeds didst authenticate the words of divine philosophy. O old man, more vehement than tortures, and elder, more resilient than fire,
**11** and Eleazar, greatest king over passions!
**12** For just as our father Aaron, armed with the censer, by running through the nation-striking fire and the burning, did conquer an angel, so also Eleazar, son of Aaron, though melted by the fire, did not turn his reason.
**13** And yet, most wondrously, being an old man, with the sinews of his body already loosened,
**14** and his flesh grown slack, and his nerves gaping, he endured. By the spirit of his reason, and by Israelite reason, he annulled the many-headed rack.
**15** O blessed old age, and venerable hoary head, and lawful life,
**16** which a faithful seal of death brought to perfection! If then therefore an old man...
