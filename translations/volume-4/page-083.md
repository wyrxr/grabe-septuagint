    ΚΕΦ. Β΄. ΜΑΚΚΑΒΑΙΩΝ Α΄.
    33 στήσαντο πρὸς αὐτοὺς πόλεμον ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῶν σαββάτων, καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς αὐτούς· ἕως τοῦ νῦν ἱκανόν· ἐξελθόντες ποιήσατε κατὰ
    34 τὸν λόγον τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ ζήσεσθε, καὶ εἶπαν· οὐκ ἐξελευσόμεθα, οὐδὲ ποιήσομεν τὸν λόγον τοῦ βασιλέως τοῦ βεβηλῶσαι
    35 τὴν ἡμέραν τῶν σαββάτων. Καὶ ἐτάχυναν ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς πόλεμον.
    36 Καὶ οὐκ ἀπεκρίθησαν αὐτοῖς, οὐδὲ λίθεν ἐνετίναξαν αὐτοῖς, οὐδὲ
    37 ἐνέφραξαν τοὺς κρύφους, λέγοντες· ἀποθάνωμεν οἱ πάντες ἐν τῇ ἁπλότητι ἡμῶν· μαρτυρεῖ ἐφ᾽ ἡμᾶς ὁ οὐρανὸς καὶ ἡ γῆ, ὅτι ἀκρίτως ἀπόλλυτε ἡμᾶς.
    38 Καὶ ἀνέστησαν ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ τοῖς σάββασι, καὶ ἀπέθανον αὐτοὶ καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες αὐτῶν,
    39 καὶ τὰ τέκνα αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰ κτήνη αὐτῶν ἕως χιλίων ψυχῶν ἀνθρώπων. Καὶ ἔγνω Ματταθίας, καὶ οἱ φίλοι αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπένθησαν ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς ἕως σφόδρα.
    40 Καὶ εἶπεν ἀνὴρ πρὸς τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ· ἐὰν πάντες ποιήσωμεν ὡς οἱ ἀδελφοὶ ἡμῶν ἐποίησαν,
    41 καὶ μὴ πολεμήσωμεν εἰς τὰ ἔθνη ὑπὲρ τῆς ψυχῆς ἡμῶν καὶ τῶν δικαιωμάτων ἡμῶν, νῦν τάχιστ᾽ ἡμᾶς ὀλεθρεύσουσιν ἀπὸ τῆς
    42 γῆς, καὶ ἐβουλεύσαντο τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, λέγοντες· πᾶς ἄνθρωπος ὅς ἐὰν ἔλθῃ πρὸς ἡμᾶς εἰς πόλεμον τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῶν σαββάτων, πολεμήσωμεν κατέναντι αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἀποθάνωμεν πάντες
    43 καθὼς ἀπέθανον οἱ ἀδελφοὶ ἡμῶν ἐν τοῖς κρύφοις. Τότε συνήχθησαν πρὸς αὐτοὺς συναγωγὴ ᾿Ασιδαίων, ἰσχυροὶ δυνάμει ἀπὸ
    44 Ἰσραήλ, πᾶς ὁ ἐκουσιάζόμενος τῷ νόμῳ. Καὶ πάντες οἱ φυγαδεύοντες ἀπὸ τῶν κακῶν προσετέθησαν αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἐγένοντο αὐτοῖς εἰς στήριγμα.
    45 Καὶ συνεστησάντο δύναμιν, καὶ ἐπάταξαν ἁμαρτωλοὺς ἐν ὀργῇ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἄνδρας ἀνόμους ἐν θυμῷ αὐτῶν·
    46 καὶ οἱ λοιποὶ ἔφυγον εἰς τὰ ἔθνη σωθῆναι. Καὶ ἐκύκλωσε Ματταθίας καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ καθεῖλον τοὺς βωμοὺς αὐτῶν, καὶ περιέτεμον τὰ παιδάρια τὰ ἀπερίτμητα ὅσα εὗρον ἐν ὁρίοις Ἰσραὴλ ἐν ἰσχύϊ.
    47 Καὶ ἐδίωξαν τοὺς υἱοὺς τῆς ὑπερηφανίας, καὶ
    48 κατευοδώθη τὸ ἔργον ἐν χειρὶ αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἀντελάβοντο τοῦ νόμου ἐκ χειρὸς τῶν ἐθνῶν καὶ ἐκ χειρὸς τῶν βασιλέων, καὶ οὐκ ἔδωκαν κέρας τῷ ἁμαρτωλῷ.
    49 Καὶ ἤγγισαν αἱ ἡμέραι τοῦ Ματταθίου ἀποθανεῖν, καὶ εἶπεν τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ· νῦν ἐστηρίχθη ὑπερηφανία καὶ ἐλεγμὸς καὶ καιρὸς καταστροφῆς καὶ ὀργὴ θυμοῦ.
    50 Καὶ νῦν τέκνα ζηλώσατε τῷ νόμῳ, καὶ δότε τὰς ψυχὰς ὑμῶν ὑπὲρ
    51 διαθήκης πατέρων ἡμῶν. Μνήσθητε τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν τὰ ἔργα ἃ

**Chapter 2**

**33** They did set the battle in array against them on the Sabbath day, and they said unto them, "Hitherto hath it been enough; come ye forth and do according to the word of the king, and ye shall live."
**34** But they said, "We will not come forth, neither will we do the word of the king, to profane the Sabbath day."
**35** And [the king's men] hastened to make war upon them.
**36** And they answered them not, neither did they cast a stone at them, neither did they block up their secret places, saying,
**37** "Let us all die in our integrity; Heaven and earth bear witness for us, that ye destroy us unjustly."
**38** So they rose up against them in battle on the Sabbath, and they died, both they and their wives, and their children, and their cattle, even a thousand souls of men.
**39** And Mattathias and his friends knew [it], and they mourned for them exceedingly.
**40** And one man said unto his neighbour, "If we all do as our brethren have done,
**41** and fight not against the Gentiles for our lives and our ordinances, then will they now quickly destroy us from the earth."
**42** So they counselled on that day, saying, "Whosoever shall come against us to battle on the Sabbath day, let us fight against him, and we shall not all die as our brethren died in the secret places."
**43** Then there gathered unto them a congregation of Hasideans, mighty men of strength from Israel, every one who was willingly devoted unto the Law.
**44** And all they that fled from the evils were added unto them, and they became a support unto them.
**45** And they arrayed a force, and smote the sinners in their wrath, and the lawless men in their fury;
**46** and the rest fled unto the Gentiles to save themselves. And Mattathias and his sons went about, and pulled down their altars, and circumcised all the uncircumcised children whom they found within the borders of Israel, with [great] might.
**47** And they pursued the sons of pride, and
**48** the work prospered in their hand. And they recovered the Law out of the hand of the Gentiles and out of the hand of kings, and they gave no strength to the sinner.
**49** And the days of Mattathias drew nigh for him to die, and he said unto his sons, "Now hath pride been strengthened, and reproof, and a time of destruction, and the wrath of fury.
**50** And now, children, be zealous for the Law, and give your lives for the covenant of our fathers.
**51** Remember the deeds of our fathers which
