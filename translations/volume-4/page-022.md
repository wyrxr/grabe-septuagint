καὶ τοὺς ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι τοῦ Καρμήλου, καὶ Γαλαάδ, καὶ τὴν ἄνω 8
Γαλιλαίαν, καὶ τὸ μέγα πεδίον Ἐσδρηλώμ, καὶ πάντας τοὺς ἐν 9
Σαμαρείᾳ καὶ ταῖς πόλεσιν αὐτῆς, καὶ πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου ἕως
Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ Βετάνη, καὶ Χελούς, καὶ Κάδης, καὶ τοῦ πο-
ταμοῦ Αἰγύπτου, καὶ Ταφνάς, καὶ Ῥαμεσσῆ, καὶ πᾶσαν γῆν
Γεσέμ, ἕως τοῦ ἐλθεῖν ἐπάνω Τάνεως καὶ Μέμφεως, καὶ πάντας 10
τοὺς κατοικοῦντας τὴν Αἴγυπτον ἕως τοῦ ἐλθεῖν ἐπὶ τὰ ὅρια τῆς
Αἰθιοπίας. Καὶ ἐφαύλισαν πάντες οἱ κατοικοῦντες πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν 11
τὸ ῥῆμα Ναβουχοδονόσορ βασιλέως Ἀσσυρίων, καὶ οὐ συνῆλθον
αὐτῷ εἰς τὸν πόλεμον, ὅτι οὐκ ἐφοβήθησαν αὐτόν, ἀλλ᾿ ἦν ἐναν-
τίον αὐτῶν ὡς ἀνὴρ εἷς· καὶ ἀπέστρεψαν τοὺς ἀγγέλους αὐτοῦ
κενοὺς ἐν ἀτιμίᾳ ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐθυμώθη Ναβου- 12
χοδονόσορ ἐπὶ πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν ταύτην σφόδρα, καὶ ὤμοσε κατὰ
τοῦ θρόνου καὶ τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ, εἰ μὴν ἐκδικήσειν πάντα τὰ
ὅρια τῆς Κιλικίας, καὶ Δαμασκηνῆς καὶ Συρίας, ἀνελεῖν τῇ ῥομ-
φαίᾳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντας τοὺς κατοικοῦντας ἐν γῇ Μωάβ, καὶ τοὺς
υἱοὺς Ἀμμών, καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν Ἰουδαίαν, καὶ πάντας τοὺς ἐν Αἰ-
γύπτῳ ἕως τοῦ ἐλθεῖν ἐπὶ τὰ ὅρια τῶν δύο θαλασσῶν. Καὶ πα- 13
ρετάξατο ἐν τῇ δυνάμει αὐτοῦ πρὸς Ἀρφαξὰδ βασιλέα ἐν τῷ ἔτει
τῷ ἑπτακαιδεκάτῳ, καὶ ἐκραταιώθη ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ
ἀνέστρεψε πᾶσαν τὴν δύναμιν Ἀρφαξὰδ, καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν ἵππον
αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντα τὰ ἅρματα αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐκυρίευσε τῶν πόλεων 14
αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀφίκετο ἕως Ἐκβατάνων, καὶ ἐκράτησε τῶν πύργων,
καὶ ἐπρονόμευσε τὰς πλατείας αὐτῆς, καὶ τὸν κόσμον αὐτῆς ἔθη-
κεν εἰς ὄνειδος αὐτῆς. Καὶ ἔλαβε τὸν Ἀρφαξὰδ ἐν τοῖς ὄρεσι 15
Ῥαγαῦ, καὶ κατηκόντισεν αὐτὸν ἐν ταῖς ζιβύναις αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐ-
ξωλέθρευσεν αὐτὸν ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ἐκείνης. Καὶ ἀνέστρεφε μετ᾿ 16
αὐτῶν εἰς Νινευὴ αὐτός, καὶ πᾶς ὁ σύμμικτος αὐτοῦ, πλῆθος ἀν-
δρῶν πολεμιστῶν πολὺ σφόδρα· καὶ ἦν ἐκεῖ ῥᾳθυμῶν καὶ εὐω-
χούμενος, αὐτός, καὶ ἡ δύναμις αὐτοῦ ἐφ᾿ ἡμέρας ἑκατὸν εἴκοσι.

### THE BOOK OF JUDITH

#### CHAPTER 1

8 ...and them that dwell among the nations of Carmel, and Gilead, and the Upper Galilee, and the great plain of Esdraelon;
9 and all them that dwell in Samaria and its cities, and beyond the Jordan even unto Jerusalem, and Betane, and Chelous, and Kades, and unto the river of Egypt, and Taphnas, and Ramesse, and all the land of Gesem,
10 until one comes above Tanis and Memphis, and all them that dwell in Egypt until one comes unto the borders of Ethiopia.
11 Yet all they that dwelt in all the land did set at naught the word of Nebuchadnezzar, king of the Assyrians, and came not together with him unto the war; for they feared him not, but regarded him as but one man. And they sent back his messengers empty and with dishonor from their presence.
12 And Nebuchadnezzar was greatly wroth against all this land, and swore by his throne and by his kingdom, that surely he would avenge himself upon all the borders of Cilicia, and of Damascus, and of Syria, to slay them with his sword; and all them that dwelt in the land of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and all Judea, and all them that were in Egypt, until one should come unto the borders of the two seas.
13 And he arrayed his forces against King Arphaxad in the seventeenth year, and he prevailed in his war, and routed all the army of Arphaxad, and all his horsemen, and all his chariots;
14 and he took possession of his cities, and came even unto Ecbatana, and seized the towers thereof, and plundered her broad places, and made her adornment a [thing of] reproach unto her.
15 And he captured Arphaxad in the mountains of Ragau, and pierced him with his javelins, and utterly destroyed him, [even] unto that day.
16 And he returned with them unto Nineveh, he himself and all his mixed multitude, a very great host of warrior-men; and there did he rest at ease and feast, he and his army, for an hundred and twenty days.

#### CHAPTER 2

1 And in the eighteenth year, on the twenty-second [day] of the first month, a word came to pass in the house of Nebuchadnezzar, king of the Assyrians, [that he should] take vengeance on all the earth, even as he had spoken.
2 And he called together all his servants, and all his great men, and laid before them the secret of his counsel; and he brought to completion all the evil [he purposed] for the land, by the word of his mouth.
