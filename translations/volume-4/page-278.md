ΚΕΦ. ΙΗʹ. ΙΗΣΟΥ ΥΙΟΥ ΣΙΡΑΧ
ὅταν συντελέσει ἄνθρωπος, τότε ἄρχεται, καὶ ὅταν παύσηται,
τότε ἀπορριφθήσεται. Τί ἄνθρωπος καὶ τί ἡ χρῆσις αὐτοῦ; τί
ἀγαθὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τί τὸ κακὸν αὐτοῦ; Ἀριθμὸς ἡμερῶν ἀνθρώπου
πολλὰ ἔτη ἑκατόν· ὡς σαγὼν ὕδατος ἀπὸ θαλάσσης καὶ ψῆρος ἄμμου,
οὕτως χίλια ἔτη ἐν ἡμέρᾳ αἰῶνος. Διὰ τοῦτο ἐμακροθύμησε
Κύριος ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἐξέχεεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ· ἴδε καὶ
ἐπέγνω τὴν καταστροφὴν αὐτῶν ὅτι πονηρά, διὰ τοῦτο ἐπλήθυνε τὸν
ἐξιλασμὸν αὐτοῦ. Ἔλεος ἀνθρώπου ἐπὶ τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ, ἔλεος δὲ
Κυρίου ἐπὶ πᾶσαν σάρκα. Ἐλέγχων καὶ παιδεύων καὶ διδάσκων, καὶ
ἐπιστρέφων ὡς ποιμὴν τὸ ποίμνιον αὐτοῦ· τοὺς ἐκδεχομένους παιδείαν
ἐλεεῖ, καὶ τοὺς κατασπεύδοντας ἐπὶ τὰ κρίματα αὐτοῦ. Τέκνων
ἐν ἀγαθοῖς μὴ δῷς μῶμον, καὶ ἐν πάσῃ δόσει λύπην λόγων.
Οὐχὶ καύσωνα ἀναπαύσει δρόσος; οὕτως χρείσσων λόγος ἢ ἡ δόσις·
οὐκ ἰδοὺ λόγος ὑπὲρ δόμα ἀγαθόν; καὶ ἀμφότερα παρὰ ἀνδρὶ κεχαριτωμένῳ.
Μωρὸς ἀχαρίστως ὀνειδιεῖ, καὶ δόσις βασκάνου ἐκθήκει ὀφθαλμούς.
Πρὶν ἢ λαλήσαι μάνθανε, καὶ πρὸ ἀρρωστίας θεραπεύσου·
πρὸ κρίσεως ἐξέταζε σεαυτόν, καὶ ἐν ὥρᾳ ἐπισκοπῆς
εὑρήσεις ἱλασμόν· πρὶν ἀρρωστῆσαι σὲ ταπεινώθητι, καὶ ἐν καιρῷ
ἁμαρτημάτων δεῖξον ἐπιστροφήν. Μὴ ἐμποδισθῇς τοῦ ἀποδοῦναι
εὐχὴν εὐκαίρως, καὶ μὴ μείνῃς ἕως θανάτου δικαιωθῆναι· πρὶν
ἐξέρχεσθαι ἑτοίμασον σεαυτόν, καὶ μὴ γίνου ὡς ἄνθρωπος πειράζων
τὸν Κύριον. Μνήσθητι θυμοῦ ἐν ἡμέραις τελευτῆς, καὶ καιρὸν
ἐκδικήσεως ἐν ἀποστροφῇ προσώπου· μνήσθητι (κατὰ) καιρὸν
λιμοῦ ἐν ἡμέραις πλησμονῆς, πτωχείαν καὶ ἔνδειαν ἐν ἡμέραις
πλούτου. Ἀπὸ πρωΐθεν ἕως ἑσπέρας μεταβάλλει καιρός, καὶ πάντα
ἐστὶ ταχινὰ ἔναντι Κυρίου. Ἄνθρωπος σοφὸς ἐν παντὶ εὐλαβηθήσεται,
καὶ ἐν ἡμέραις ἁμαρτιῶν προσέξει ἀπὸ πλημμελείας·
καὶ ἄφρων οὐ συντηρήσει καιρόν. Πᾶς συνετὸς ἔγνω σοφίαν, καὶ
τῷ εὑρόντι αὐτὴν δώσει ἐξομολόγησιν. Συνετοὶ ἐν λόγοις καὶ αὐτοὶ
ἐσοφίσαντο, καὶ ἀνώμβρησαν παροιμίας ἀκριβεῖς. Ἐγκράτεια
ψυχῆς. Ὀπίσω τῶν ἐπιθυμιῶν σου μὴ πορεύου, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ὀρέξεών
σου (μὴ) κωλύου· ἐὰν χορηγήσῃ τῇ ψυχῇ σου εὐδοκίαν ἐπιθυμίας,
ποιήσει σε ἐπίχαρμα τῶν ἐχθρῶν σου. Μὴ εὐφραίνου ἐπὶ
πολλῇ τρυφῇ, μηδὲ προσδεηθῇς συμβολῆς αὐτῆς· μὴ γίνου πτωχὸς
συμβολοκοπῶν ἐκ δανεισμοῦ, καὶ οὐδέν σοι ἔστιν ἐν μαρσίππῳ·
ἔσῃ γὰρ ἐπίβουλος τῆς ἰδίας ζωῆς λαλητός.

**Chapter Eighteen**

When a man shall complete [his task], then doth he begin;
and when he ceaseth, then shall he be cast away.
What is man, and what is his purpose?
What is his good, and what his evil?
The count of a man's days [is] many years, a hundred;
even as a drop of water from the sea, and a grain of sand,
so are a thousand years in a day of the [eternal] age.
Therefore hath the Lord been long-suffering towards them,
and hath poured out upon them His mercy;
for He beheld and knew their destruction, that it was evil;
therefore did He multiply His propitiation.
The mercy of man is shown towards his neighbor,
but the mercy of the Lord is upon all flesh.
[He is] rebuking and disciplining and teaching,
and turning back as a shepherd his flock;
those who await discipline doth He pity,
and those who hasten unto His judgments.
Unto children, in [matters of] goodness, give thou no blemish;
and in every gift, [let there be] no sorrow of words.
Shall not the dew relieve the searing heat?
So is a [gracious] word better than a [mere] gift;
behold, is not a [gracious] word better than a good gift?
Yea, and both are found with a man of [divine] favor.
A fool shall ungratefully heap reproach,
and the gift of an envious man doth blind the eyes.
Before thou dost speak, learn;
and before illness doth befall thee, heal thyself;
before judgment, examine thou thyself;
and in the hour of [God's] visitation, shalt thou find propitiation.
Before thou fallest sick, humble thyself;
and in the time of [thy] sins, show forth repentance.
Be not hindered from paying a vow in due season,
and tarry not until death that thou mightest be justified.
Before thou art called forth, prepare thyself;
and be not as a man who doth tempt the Lord.
Remember [God's] wrath in the days of [thy] end,
and the time of [His] vengeance when He doth turn away His face.
Remember [the] time of famine in the days of plenty;
[remember] poverty and want in the days of wealth.
From morning until evening, doth the season change;
and all things are swift before the Lord.
A wise man shall be circumspect in all things,
and in the days of sins shall take heed against transgression;
but a fool shall not heed the [proper] season.
Every man of understanding hath known wisdom,
and unto him that findeth it shall give [forth] praise.
Men of understanding in words have themselves become wise,
and have poured forth precise proverbs.

**The Self-Control of the Soul**

Follow not after thy desires,
and from thy cravings, do not restrain thyself;
if [thy soul] grant unto thee the good pleasure of [thy] desires,
it shall make thee a [source of] joy to thy enemies.
Rejoice not in much luxury,
neither be thou dependent upon its provisions;
become not a pauper who maketh contributions by borrowing,
and [who then] hath nothing in his purse;
for thou shalt be a known plotter against thine own life.
