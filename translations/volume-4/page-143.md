**8** ὑπενόθευσεν Ἰάσων ὁ ἀδελφὸς Ὀνίου τὴν ἀρχιερωσύνην· Ἐπαγγειλάμενος τῷ βασιλεῖ δι᾽ ἐντεύξεως ἀργυρίου τάλαντα ἑξήκοντα πρὸς τοῖς τριακοσίοις, καὶ προσόδου τινὸς ἄλλης τάλαντα ὀγδοήκοντα.
**9** Πρὸς δὲ τούτοις ὑπισχνεῖτο καὶ ἕτερα διαγράψειν πεντήκοντα πρὸς τοῖς ἑκατόν, ἐὰν συγχωρηθῇ διὰ τῆς ἐξουσίας αὐτοῦ, γυμνάσιον καὶ ἐφηβίαν αὐτῷ συστήσασθαι, καὶ τοὺς ἐν Ἱεροσολύμοις Ἀντιοχεῖς ἀναγράψαι.
**10** Ἐπινεύσαντος δὲ τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ τῆς ἀρχῆς κρατήσας, εὐθέως πρὸς τὸν Ἑλληνικὸν χαρακτῆρα τοὺς ὁμοφύλους μετέστησε.
**11** Καὶ τὰ κείμενα τοῖς Ἰουδαίοις φιλάνθρωπα βασιλικὰ διὰ Ἰωάννου τοῦ πατρὸς Εὐπολέμου, τοῦ ποιησαμένου τὴν πρεσβείαν ὑπὲρ φιλίας καὶ συμμαχίας πρὸς τοὺς Ῥωμαίους, παρώσατο καὶ τὰς μὲν νομίμους.
**12** καταλῦων πολιτείας, παρανόμους ἐθισμοὺς ἐκαίνιζεν. Ἀσμένως γὰρ ὑπ᾽ αὐτὴν τὴν ἀκρόπολιν γυμνάσιον καθίδρυσε, καὶ τοὺς κρατίστους τῶν ἐφήβων ὑποτάσσων ὑπὸ πέτασον ἤγαγεν.
**13** Ἦν δ᾽ οὕτως ἀκμή τις τοῦ Ἑλληνισμοῦ, καὶ πρόσβασις ἀλλοφυλισμοῦ διὰ τὴν τοῦ ἀσεβοῦς καὶ οὐκ ἀρχιερέως Ἰάσωνος ὑπερβάλλουσαν ἀναγείαν,
**14** ὥστε μηκέτι περὶ τὰς τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου λειτουργίας προθύμους εἶναι τοὺς ἱερεῖς, ἀλλὰ τοῦ μὲν ναοῦ καταφρονοῦντες καὶ τῶν θυσιῶν ἀμελοῦντες, ἔσπευδον μετέχειν τῆς ἐν παλαίστρῃ παρανόμου χορηγίας, μετὰ τὴν τοῦ δίσκου πρόκλησιν.
**15** Καὶ τὰς μὲν πατρῴας τιμὰς ἐν οὐδενὶ τιθέμενοι, τὰς δὲ Ἑλληνικὰς δόξας καλλίστας ἡγούμενοι.
**16** Ὧν καὶ χάριν περιέσχεν αὐτούς, χαλεπὴ περίστασις, καὶ ὧν ἐζήλουν τὰς ἀγωγὰς καὶ καθάπαν ἤθελον ἐξομοιοῦσθαι, τούτους πολεμίους καὶ τιμωρητὰς ἔσχον.
**17** Ἀσεβεῖν γὰρ εἰς τοὺς θείους νόμους οὐ ῥᾴδιον·
**18** ἀλλὰ ταῦτα ὁ ἀκόλουθος καιρὸς δηλώσει. Ἀγομένου δὲ πενταετηρικοῦ ἀγῶνος ἐν Τύρῳ, καὶ τοῦ βασιλέως παρόντος, ἀπέστειλεν.
**19** Ἰάσων ὁ μιαρὸς θεωροὺς ὡς ἀπὸ Ἱεροσολύμων Ἀντιοχεῖς ὄντας, παρακομίζοντας ἀργυρίου δραχμὰς τριακοσίας εἰς τὴν τοῦ Ἡρακλέους θυσίαν, ἃς καὶ ἠξίωσαν οἱ παρακομίζοντες μὴ χρῆσθαι εἰς θυσίαν, διὰ τὸ μὴ καθήκειν, εἰς ἑτέραν δὲ.
**20** καταθέσθαι δαπάνην. Ἔπεμψεν οὖν ταῦτα διὰ μὲν τῶν ἀποστειλάντα εἰς τὴν τοῦ Ἡρακλέους θυσίαν, ἕνεκα δὲ τῶν παρακομιζόντων εἰς τὰς τῶν τριήρων κατασκευάς.
**21** Ἀποσταλέντος δὲ εἰς Αἴγυπτον Ἀπολλωνίου τοῦ Μενεσθέως διὰ τὰ πρωτοκλίσια Πτολεμαίου τοῦ Φιλομήτορος βασιλέως,

#### CHAPTER IV.

**8** Jason, the brother of Onias, did usurp the high priesthood; having promised unto the king through petition three hundred and sixty talents of silver, and eighty talents of another revenue.
**9** Moreover, to these things he promised to add a hundred and fifty talents more, if it were granted unto him through the king’s authority to establish for himself a gymnasium and an ephebeion, and to enroll the Antiochenes in Jerusalem.
**10** And when the king had assented, and he had laid hold of the principality, immediately did he transpose his countrymen unto the Greek character.
**11** And the royal privileges granted unto the Jews, which were [established] through John, the father of Eupolemus, who had made the embassy for friendship and alliance with the Romans, he did cast aside, and the lawful
**12** polities dissolving, did innovate unlawful customs. For gladly did he establish a gymnasium directly beneath the citadel, and leading the noblest of the youths, did bring them under the hat [of shame].
**13** And there was thus a height of Hellenization, and an increase of foreign customs, through the exceeding manifestation of impious Jason's godlessness, who was no high priest;
**14** insomuch that the priests were no longer zealous concerning the services of the altar, but disdaining the Temple and neglecting the sacrifices, they hastened to participate in the unlawful distributions in the wrestling school, after the challenging of the discus.
**15** And holding the ancestral honors in no regard, but deeming the Greek glories to be most excellent.
**16** For the sake of these things, a grievous plight did encompass them, and those whose customs they eagerly emulated and wholly desired to be like, these did they find to be their enemies and avengers.
**17** For it is not easy to act impiously against the divine laws;
**18** but these things shall the succeeding time declare. Now when a quinquennial contest was being held in Tyre, and the king was present,
**19** Jason, the defiled one, did send observers, as if they were Antiochenes from Jerusalem, conveying three hundred drachmas of silver for the sacrifice to Heracles, which those who conveyed them did themselves deem should not be used for sacrifice, because it was not fitting, but should be laid out for another
**20** expense. Jason, therefore, sent these [funds], which, though by the senders they were [intended] for the sacrifice of Heracles, yet by reason of the carriers, were set apart for the construction of triremes.
**21** Now when Apollonius, the son of Menestheus, was sent unto Egypt because of the first sittings [at table] of King Ptolemy Philometor,
