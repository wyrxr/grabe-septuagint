KEΦ. ΙΓ´. ΜΑΚΚΑΒΑΙΩΝ Β´. 1699

ἐγκρατεῖς, ἐξελθόντας κρῖναι τὰ πράγματα τῷ τοῦ Κυρίου βοη-
θείᾳ. Δεὺς δὲ τὴν ἐπιτροπὴν τῷ κτίστῃ τοῦ κόσμου, παρα- 14
καλέσας τοὺς σὺν αὐτῷ γενναίους ἀγωνίσασθαι μέχρι θανάτου
περὶ νόμων, περὶ ἱεροῦ, πόλεως, πατρίδος, πολιτείας, περὶ δὲ
Μωδεὶν ἐποιήσατο τὴν στρατοπεδείαν. Δοὺς δὲ τοῖς περὶ αὐτὸν 15
σύνθημα Θεοῦ νίκης, μετὰ νενικηκὼν ἀρίστων κεκριμένων ἐπι-
βαλὼν νύκτωρ ἐπὶ τὴν βασιλικὴν αὐλήν, ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ ἀ-
νεῖλεν εἰς ἄνδρας τετρακισχιλίους, καὶ τὸν πρωτεύοντα τῶν ἐ-
λεφάντων σὺν τῷ κατ' οἰκίαν ἄλλῳ συνέθηκε· καὶ τὸ τέλος τὴν 16
παρεμβολὴν δέους καὶ ταραχῆς ἐπλήρωσαν, καὶ ἐξέλυσαν εὐμε-
ροῦντες. Ὑποφαινούσης δὲ ἤδη τῆς ἡμέρας τοῦτ' ἐγένετο. διὰ τὴν 17
ἐπαρχήουσαν αὐτῷ τοῦ Κυρίου σκέπην. Ὁ δὲ βασιλεὺς εἰληφὼς 18
γεῦσιν τῆς τῶν Ἰουδαίων εὐτολμίας, κατεπείρασε διὰ μελλόνων
τοὺς τόπους. Καὶ ἐπὶ Βαιθσούρα φρούριον ὀχυρὸν τῶν Ἰου- 19
δαίων προσῆγε· καὶ ἐτροποῦτο, προσενέκρουσεν, ἠλαττονοῦ-
το. Τοῖς δὲ ἔνδον Ἰούδας τὰ δέοντα εἰσήνεγκε. 20. 21
γειλε δὲ τὰ μυστήρια τοῖς πολεμίοις Ῥόδοκος ἐκ τῆς Ἰου-
δαϊκῆς τάξεως. Ἀνεζητήθη δὲ, καὶ κατελήφθη, καὶ κατεκλείσθη.
Ἐδευτερολογήθη δ βασιλεὺς τοῖς ἐν Βαιθσούρα, δεξιὰν 22
ἔδωκεν, ἔλαβεν, ἀπῆει, προσέβαλε τοῖς περὶ τὸν Ἰούδαν, ἧττον 23
ἐγένετο, μετέλαβεν ἀπονοηθῆναι τὸν Φίλιππον ἐν Ἀντιοχείᾳ τὸν
ἀπολελειμμένον ἐπὶ τῶν πραγμάτων, συνεχύθη, τοὺς Ἰουδαίους
παρεκάλεσεν, ὑπετάγη, καὶ ὤμοσεν ἐπὶ πᾶσι τοῖς δικαίοις, συ-
νελύθη, καὶ θυσίαν προσήγαγεν, ἐτίμησε τὸν νεώ, καὶ τὸν τόπον
ἐφιλανθρώπησε, καὶ τὸν Μακκαβαῖον ἀπεδέξατο, κατέλιπε στρα- 24
τηγὸν ἀπὸ Πτολεμαΐδος ἕως τῶν Γερρηνῶν ἡγεμονίαν, ἦλθεν εἰς 25
Πτολεμαΐδα· ἐδυσφόρουν περὶ τῶν συνθηκῶν οἱ Πτολεμαεῖς, ἐ-
δειλίαζε γὰρ ὑπὲρ ὧν ἠθέλησαν ἀθετεῖν τὰς διασταλσίς. Προ- 26
σῆλθεν ἐπὶ τὸ βῆμα Λυσίας, ἀπελογήσατο ἐνδεχομένως, συνέ-
πεισε, κατεπράϋνεν, εὐμενεῖς ἐποίησεν, ἀνεζεύξεν εἰς Ἀντιόχειαν·
οὕτω τὰ τῆς ἐφόδου τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ τῆς ἀναζυγῆς ἐχώρησε.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΔ´. XIV.

ΜΕΤΑ δὲ τριετῆ χρόνον προσέπεσε τοῖς περὶ τὸν Ἰούδαν, 1
Δημήτριον τὸν τοῦ Σελεύκου διὰ τοῦ κατὰ Τρίπολιν λιμένος εἰσ-
πλεύσαντα μετὰ πλήθους ἰσχυροῦ καὶ στόλου, κεκρατηκέναι τῆς
χώρας, ἐπανελόμενον Ἀντίοχον καὶ τὸν τούτου ἐπίτροπον Λυ-
σίαν. Ἄλκιμος δέ τις προγενόμενος ἀρχιερεύς, ἑκουσίως δὲ με-
μολυμμένος ἐν τοῖς τῆς ἐπιμιξίας χρόνοις, συννοήσας, ὅτι καθ’
ὁντιναοῦν τρόπον οὐκ ἔστιν αὐτῷ σωτηρία, οὐδὲ πρὸς τὸ ἅγιον
θυσιαστήριον ἔτι πρόσοδοι, ἧκε πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Δημήτριον ὡς
πρώτῳ καὶ ἑκατοστῷ καὶ πεντηκοστῷ ἔτει, προσάγων αὐτῷ στέ-
φανον χρυσοῦν καὶ φοίνικα, πρὸς δὲ τούτοις τῶν νομιζομένων
θαλλῶν τοῦ ἱεροῦ· καὶ τὴν ἡμέραν ἐκείνην ἡσυχίαν ἔσχε. Και-
ρὸν δὲ λαβὼν τῆς ἰδίας ἀνοίας συνεργὸν, προσκληθεὶς εἰς συνέ-
δριον ὑπὸ τοῦ Δημητρίου, καὶ ἐπερωτηθεὶς ἐν τίνι διαθέσει καὶ
βουλὴ καθεστήκασιν οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι, πρὸς ταῦτα ἔφη· Οἱ λεγόμενοι
τῶν Ἰουδαίων Ἀσσαῖοι, ὧν ἀφηγεῖται Ἰούδας ὁ Μακκαβαῖος,
πολεμοτροφοῦσι καὶ στασιάζουσιν, οὐκ ἔδοντες τὴν βασιλείαν εὐ-
σταθείας τυχεῖν. Ὅθεν ἀφελόμενος τὴν προγονικὴν δόξαν, λέ-
γω δὴ τὴν ἀρχιερωσύνην, δεῦρο νῦν ἐλήλυθα, πρῶτον μὲν ὑπὲρ
τῶν ἀνηκόντων τῷ βασιλεῖ γνησίως φρονῶν, δεύτερον δὲ καὶ τῶν
ἰδίων πολιτῶν στοχαζόμενος· τῇ μὲν γὰρ τῶν προειρημένων ἀ-
λογιστίᾳ τὸ σύμπαν ἡμῶν γένος οὐ μικρῶς ἀκληρεῖ. Ἕκαστα
δὲ τούτων ἐπεγνωκὼς σὺ βασιλεῦ, καὶ τῆς χώρας καὶ τοῦ πε-
ριισταμένου γένους ἡμῶν προνοήθητι, καθ’ ἣν ἔχεις πρὸς ἅπαντας
εὐαπάντητον φιλανθρωπίαν. Ἄχρι γὰρ Ἰούδας περίεστιν, ἀδύνα-
τον εἰρήνης τυχεῖν τὰ πράγματα. Τοιούτων δὲ ῥηθέντων ὑπὸ
τούτου, θᾶττον οἱ λοιποὶ φίλοι δυσμενῶς ἔχοντες τὰ πρὸς τὸν
Ἰούδαν προσεπύρωσαν τὸν Δημήτριον. Προσκαλεσάμενος δὲ εὐ-
θέως τὸν Νικάνορα τὸν γενόμενον ἐλεφαντάρχην, καὶ στρατηγὸν
ἀναδείξας τῆς Ἰουδαίας, ἐξαπέστειλε· δοὺς ἐντολὰς αὐτὸν μὲν
τὸν Ἰούδαν ἐπανελέσθαι, τοὺς δὲ σὺν αὐτῷ σκορπίσαι, καταστῆ-
σαι δὲ Ἄλκιμον ἀρχιερέα τοῦ μεγίστου ἱεροῦ. Τὰ δὲ ἐκ τῆς
Ἰουδαίας περιγαδευκότα τὸν Ἰούδαν ἔθνη συνέμισγον ἀγεληδὸν
τῷ Νικάνορι, τὰς τῶν Ἰουδαίων ἀτυχίας καὶ συμφορὰς ἰδίας εὐη-
μερίας δοκοῦντες ἔσεσθαι. Ἀκούσαντες δὲ τὴν τοῦ Νικάνορος
ἔφοδον καὶ τὴν ἐπίθεσιν τῶν ἐθνῶν, κατασπασάμενοι γῆν ἐλιτά-
νευον τὸν ἄχρι αἰῶνος συστήσαντα τὸν ἑαυτοῦ λαὸν, ἀεὶ δὲ μετ’
ἐπιφανείας ἀντιλαμβανόμενον τῆς ἑαυτοῦ μερίδος. Προστάξαν-

**Chapter 13**

**13** [that] they might be masters, that having gone forth, they might judge the matters by the aid of the Lord.

**14** And [having given] the charge unto the Creator of the world, he exhorted those valiant men who were with him to contend even unto death for the laws, for the Temple, for the city, for their homeland, and for the commonwealth; and he pitched his camp at Modin.

**15** And having given to those about him the watchword, 'Victory of God,' Judas, [he himself] having conquered, with chosen valiant men, falling upon the royal court by night, slew in the camp four thousand men, and the chief of the elephants, with another [from the] household, he *put together*.

**16** And finally, they filled the camp with dread and confusion, and they released [themselves from the camp], prospering.

**17** And this came to pass as day was already dawning, by reason of the Lord's protection *presiding over* him.

**18** But the king, having tasted of the boldness of the Jews, assayed the places by means of those *who were to come*.

**19** And he advanced upon Beth-zur, a strong fortress of the Jews; and he was repulsed, he met with resistance, he was diminished.

**20** And to those within, Judas conveyed the necessary [provisions].

**21** And Rhodocus, from the Jewish ranks, reported the mysteries to the enemies. But he was sought out, and apprehended, and imprisoned.

**22** Again, the king spoke to those in Beth-zur; he gave his right hand, and received [theirs], and departed. He assaulted those about Judas, but was defeated.

**23** He received tidings that Philip, who had been left in charge of affairs in Antioch, had despaired, and he was troubled. He entreated the Jews, submitted, and swore upon all just [terms]. He made peace, and offered sacrifice; he honored the sanctuary, and showed benevolence to the place.

**24** And he accepted Maccabaeus, and left a general to rule from Ptolemais as far as the Gerrenians.

**25** He came to Ptolemais. But the Ptolemaians were indignant concerning the agreements; for he feared for those things which they desired to annul, [namely,] the stipulations.

**26** Lysias came forward to the tribunal, and suitably defended [his actions]; he persuaded, he calmed, he made them well-disposed, and he departed to Antioch. Thus did the matters of the king's invasion and withdrawal proceed.

**Chapter 14**

**1** Now after a space of three years, it came to the knowledge of those about Judas that Demetrius, the son of Seleucus, having entered through the port of Tripoli with a mighty multitude and a fleet, had taken possession of the country, and had removed Antiochus and Lysias, his guardian.

**3** But a certain Alcimus, who had been high priest before, but had willingly defiled himself in the times of [Gentile] mingling, perceiving that in no wise was there salvation for him, nor yet any more access to the holy altar,

**4** came unto King Demetrius in the one hundred and fifty-first year, bringing him a golden crown and a palm branch, and besides these, some of the customary boughs of the Temple.

**5** And that day he kept silence. But having received an opportune moment as a helper for his own folly, being summoned to a council by Demetrius and asked in what state and *counsel* the Jews stood,

**6** he answered thus: "Those of the Jews who are called Hasideans, whom Judas Maccabaeus leads, stir up war and faction, *giving* not that the kingdom should obtain stability.

**7** Wherefore, having taken away the ancestral glory – I mean the high priesthood – I am now come hither,

**8** first indeed, genuinely mindful of the king's concerns; and secondly, considering also my own citizens.

**9** For by the unreasonableness of the aforementioned [men], our whole race suffers no small misfortune. And knowing each of these things, O King, do thou provide for both the country and our encompassed race, according to the ready-to-meet benevolence which thou hast toward all.

**10** For as long as Judas remains, it is impossible for affairs to obtain peace."

**11** And when such things were spoken by him, the rest of the king's friends, being hostile towards Judas, did the more inflame Demetrius.

**12** But straightway, having called Nicanor, who had been chief of the elephants, and having appointed him general of Judea, he sent him forth;

**13** giving commands that he should indeed destroy Judas himself, and scatter those who were with him, and establish Alcimus as high priest of the most great Temple.

**14** But the nations that had encompassed Judas from Judea joined themselves in droves to Nicanor, supposing the misfortunes and calamities of the Jews would be their own prosperity.

**15** And when they heard of the coming of Nicanor and the attack of the nations, they prostrated themselves to the earth and implored Him who had established His people forever, and who ever with manifestation takes hold of His own portion.

**16** And when the leader commanded, straightway from thence, [them] *to depart*, and they join battle.
