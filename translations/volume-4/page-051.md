11. μένα ἐν βιβλίῳ Μωϋσῆ, καὶ οὕτως τὸ πρωϊνόν. Καὶ ὤπτησαν τὸ Πάσχα πυρὶ ὡς καθήκει, καὶ τὰς θυσίας ἤψησαν ἐν τοῖς χαλκείοις καὶ λέβησι μετ’ εὐωδίας, καὶ ἀπήνεγκαν πᾶσι τοῖς ἐκ τοῦ
12. λαοῦ. Μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα ἡτοίμασαν ἑαυτοῖς τε καὶ τοῖς ἱερεῦσιν ἀδελφοῖς
13. ἑαυτῶν, υἱοῖς Ἀαρών. Οἱ γὰρ ἱερεῖς ἀνέφερον τὰ στέατα ἕως ἀωρίας· καὶ οἱ Λευῖται ἡτοίμασαν ἑαυτοῖς καὶ τοῖς ἱερεῦσιν
14. ἀδελφοῖς αὑτῶν, υἱοῖς Ἀαρών· καὶ οἱ ἱεροψάλται υἱοὶ Ἀσὰφ ἦσαν ἐπὶ τῆς τάξεως ἑαυτῶν, κατὰ τὰ ὑπὸ Δαυὶδ τεταγμένα, καὶ Ἀσάφ,
15. καὶ Ζαχαρίας, καὶ Ἐδδινοὺς ὁ παρὰ τοῦ βασιλέως· καὶ οἱ θυρωροὶ ἐφ’ ἑκάστου πυλῶνος· οὐκ ἔστι παραβῆναι ἕκαστον τὴν ἑαυτοῦ ἐφημερίαν. οἱ γὰρ ἀδελφοὶ αὑτῶν οἱ Λευῖται ἡτοίμασαν αὐτοῖς·
16. καὶ συνετελέσθη τὰ τῆς θυσίας τοῦ Κυρίου ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἀχθῆναι τὸ Πάσχα, καὶ προσεγενεχθῆναι πᾶς θυσίας ἐπὶ τὸ τοῦ Κυρίου θυσιαστήριον, κατὰ τὴν ἐπιταγὴν τοῦ βασιλέως Ἰωσίου.
17. Καὶ ἤγαγον οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ οἱ εὑρεθέντες ἐν τῷ καιρῷ τούτῳ τὸ Πάσχα καὶ τὴν ἑορτὴν τῶν ἀζύμων ἡμέρας ἑπτά.
18. Καὶ οὐκ ἤχθη τὸ Πάσχα τοιοῦτο ἐν τῷ Ἰσραὴλ ἀπὸ τῶν χρόνων Σαμουὴλ
19. τοῦ προφήτου. Καὶ πάντες οἱ βασιλεῖς τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ οὐκ ἠγάγοσαν Πάσχα τοιοῦτο, οἷον ἤγαγεν Ἰωσίας, καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς, καὶ οἱ Λευῖται, καὶ οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι, καὶ πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ οἱ εὑρεθέντες ἐν τῇ
20. κατοικήσει αὑτῶν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ. Ὀκτωκαιδεκάτῳ ἔτει βασιλεύοντος
21. Ἰωσίου ἤχθη τὸ Πάσχα τοῦτο. Καὶ ὠρθώθη τὰ ἔργα Ἰωσίου

**11** written in the book of Moses. And thus, in the morning, did they roast the Passover with fire, as it was fitting; and the sacrifices did they boil in brazen vessels and cauldrons with a sweet savor, and they bore [them] forth unto all of the people.
**12** After these things, they prepared for themselves and for their brethren, the priests, the sons of Aaron.
**13** For the priests offered up the fat portions until the late hour; and the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests,
**14** their brethren, the sons of Aaron. And the sacred singers, the sons of Asaph, were in their appointed order, according to the things ordained by David, and Asaph,
**15** and Zechariah, and Eddinous, who was from the king; and the doorkeepers were at every gate; nor was it possible for any man to transgress his own course. For their brethren, the Levites, prepared for them;
**16** And so were the matters of the Lord's sacrifice brought to completion on that day, for to bring the Passover, and for all sacrifices to be offered upon the altar of the Lord, according to the commandment of Josiah the king.
**17** And the children of Israel, who were found at that time, kept the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days.

**23** And after all this deed of Josiah, it came to pass that Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, came forth to levy war in Carchemish upon the Euphrates; and Josiah went forth to meet him.
**24** And the king of Egypt sent messengers unto him, saying:
**25** "What have I to do with thee, O king of Judea? Am I not sent forth against thee by the Lord God? For my war is upon the Euphrates; and now the Lord is with me, and the Lord doth hasten [me] with Him. Depart therefore and resist not the Lord."
