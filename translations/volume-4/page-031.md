ΚΕΦ. Ζʹ. VII.

καὶ εἰς μῆκος ἀπὸ Βετυλούα ἕως Κυαμῶνος, ᾗ ἐστιν ἀπέναντι
4 Ἐσδρηλώμ. Οἱ δὲ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ, ὡς εἶδον αὐτὸν τὸ πλῆθος, ἐτα-
ράχθησαν σφόδρα· καὶ εἶπεν ἕκαστος πρὸς τὸν πλησίον αὑτοῦ· νῦν
ἐκλείζουσιν οὗτοι τὸ πρόσωπον πάσης τῆς γῆς, καὶ οὔτε τὰ ὄρη τὰ
ὑψηλά, οὔτε αἱ φάρυγγες, οὔτε οἱ βουνοὶ ὑποστήσονται τὸ βάρος
5 αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἀναλαβόντες ἕκαστος τὰ σκεύη τὰ πολεμικὰ αὑτῶν,
καὶ ἀνακάψαντες πυρὰς ἐπὶ τοὺς πύργους αὑτῶν, ἔμενον φυ-
6 λάσσοντες ὅλην τὴν νύκτα ἐκείνην. Τῇ δὲ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ δευτέρᾳ ἐ-
ξήγαγεν Ὁλοφέρνης πᾶσαν τὴν ἵππον αὑτοῦ κατὰ πρόσωπον τῶν
7 υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, οἳ ἦσαν ἐν Βαιτυλούᾳ, καὶ ἐπεσκέψατο τὰς ἀνα-
βάσεις τῆς πόλεως αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰς πηγὰς τῶν ὑδάτων αὐτῶν
ἐφώδευσεν, καὶ προκατελάβετο αὐτάς, καὶ ἐπέστησεν αὐταῖς πα-
ρεμβολὰς ἀνδρῶν πολεμιστῶν, καὶ αὐτὸς ἀνέζευξεν εἰς τὸν λαὸν
8 αὑτοῦ. Καὶ προσελθόντες αὐτῷ πάντες ἄρχοντες υἱῶν Ἠσαῦ,
καὶ πάντες οἱ ἡγούμενοι τοῦ λαοῦ Μωάβ, καὶ οἱ στρατηγοὶ τῆς
9 παραλίας, εἶπαν· Ἀκουσάτω δὴ λόγον ὁ δεσπότης ἡμῶν, ἵνα μὴ
10 γένηται θράυσμα ἐν τῇ δυνάμει σου. Ὁ γὰρ λαὸς οὗτος τῶν
υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ οὐ πέποιθαν ἐπὶ τοῖς δόρασιν αὑτῶν, ἀλλ᾿ ἐπὶ τοῖς
ὕφεσι τῶν ὀρέων αὑτῶν, ἐν οἷς αὐτοὶ κατοικοῦσιν ἐν αὐτοῖς· οὐ
γάρ ἐστιν εὐχερὲς προσβῆναι ταῖς κορυφαῖς τῶν ὀρέων αὑτῶν.
11 Καὶ νῦν, δέσποτα, μὴ πολέμει πρὸς αὐτούς, καθὼς γίνεται πό-
λεμος παρατάξεως, καὶ οὐ πεσεῖται ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ σου ἀνὴρ εἷς.
12 Ἀνάμεινον ἐπὶ τῆς παρεμβολῆς σου, διαφυλάσσων πάντα ἄνδρα
ἐκ τῆς δυνάμεώς σου, καὶ ἐπικρατησάτωσαν οἱ παῖδές σου τῆς
13 πηγῆς τοῦ ὕδατος, ἣ ἐκπορεύεται ἐκ τῆς ῥίζης τοῦ ὄρους· διότι
ἐκεῖθεν ὑδρεύονται πάντες οἱ κατοικοῦντες Βετυλούα, καὶ ἀνε-
λεῖ αὐτοὺς ἡ δίψα, καὶ ἐκδώσουσι πόλιν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἡμεῖς καὶ
ὁ λαὸς ἡμῶν ἀναβησόμεθα ἐπὶ τὰς πλησίον κορυφὰς τῶν ὀρέων,
καὶ παρεμβαλοῦμεν ἐπ᾿ αὐταῖς εἰς προφυλακήν, τοῦ μὴ ἐξελθεῖν
14 ἐκ τῆς πόλεως ἄνδρα ἕνα. Καὶ τακήσονται ἐν τῷ λιμῷ αὐτοὶ
καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰ τέκνα αὐτῶν· καὶ πρὶν ἐλθεῖν
τὴν ῥομφαίαν ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς, καταστρωθήσονται ἐν ταῖς πλατείαις
15 τῆς οἰκήσεως αὐτῶν· καὶ ἀνταποδώσεις αὐτοῖς ἀνταπόδομα πο-
νηρόν, ἀνθ᾿ ὧν ἐστασίασαν, καὶ οὐχ ὑπήντησαν τῷ προσώπῳ σου
16 ἐν εἰρήνῃ. Καὶ ἤρεσαν οἱ λόγοι αὐτῶν ἐνώπιον Ὁλοφέρνου, καὶ
ἐνώπιον πάντων τῶν θεραπόντων αὐτοῦ, καὶ συνέταξε ποιεῖν

#### CHAPTER 7

3 and in length from Bethulia unto Kyamon, which is opposite Esdrelom.
4 Now when the children of Israel saw him, [even] that great multitude, they were exceeding troubled; and each one said unto his neighbour, "Surely these shall now cover the face of all the earth; and neither the high mountains, nor the ravines, nor the hills shall endure the burden of them."
5 And each man took up his weapons of war, and having bent back fires upon their towers, they abode guarding all that night.
6 But on the second day, Holofernes brought forth all his cavalry before the children of Israel, who were in Bethulia; and he surveyed the ascents of their city, and reconnoitered their springs of water; and he seized them beforehand, and set encampments of men of war over them. And he himself returned unto his people.
8 Then all the rulers of the sons of Esau, and all the leaders of the people of Moab, and the generals of the coastland came unto him and said:
9 "Let our lord now hear a word, lest there be any breaking in thy power.
10 For this people of the children of Israel trust not in their spears, but in the recesses of their mountains, in which they themselves dwell therein; for it is not easy to ascend the tops of their mountains.
11 And now, O lord, wage not war against them, as a pitched battle is wont to be, and not a single man shall fall from thy people.
12 Abide within thine encampment, guarding every man from thy force; and let thy servants seize the spring of water, which issueth from the foot of the mountain;
13 for from thence do all who dwell in Bethulia draw water. And thirst shall destroy them, and they shall deliver up their city. And we and our people shall ascend upon the nearby tops of the mountains, and we shall encamp upon them for a watch, that no single man may go forth from the city.
14 And they, and their wives, and their children shall waste away in famine; and before the sword come upon them, they shall be laid low in the broad ways of their dwelling.
15 And thou shalt recompense unto them an evil recompense, for that they rebelled and met not thy face in peace."
16 And their words pleased Holofernes and all his servants; and he commanded to do as they had spoken.
