13 αὐτῶν. Ὡς πηλὸς κεραμέως ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ, πᾶσαι αἱ ὁδοὶ αὐτοῦ
14 κατὰ τὴν εὐδοκίαν αὐτοῦ· οὕτως ἄνθρωποι ἐν χειρὶ τοῦ ποιήσαν-
15 τος αὐτούς, ἀποδοῦναι αὐτοῖς κατὰ τὴν κρίσιν αὐτοῦ. Ἀπέναντι
    τοῦ κακοῦ τὸ ἀγαθόν, καὶ ἀπέναντι τοῦ θανάτου ἡ ζωή· οὕτως
16 ἀπέναντι εὐσεβοῦς ἁμαρτωλός. Καὶ οὕτως μελέτησον εἰς πάντα τὰ
    ἔργα τοῦ ὑψίσσου· δύο δύο, ἐν κατέναντι τοῦ ἑνός. (Κἀγὼ ἔσχατος
17 ἠγρύπνησα,) καὶ κατακληρονομήσον αὐτοὺς καθὼς ἀπ᾿ ἀρχῆς. Ἐλέη-
    σον λαὸν Κύριε κεκλημένον ἐπ᾿ ὀνόματί σου, καὶ Ἰσραὴλ ὃν πρωτογό-
18 νῳ ὡμοίωσας. Οἰκτείρησον πόλιν ἁγιάσματός σου, Ἱερουσαλὴμ τόπον
19 καταπαύματός σου· πλῆσον Σιὼν ἆραι τὰ λόγιά σου, καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς δό-
20 ξης σου τὸν λαόν σου. Δὸς μαρτύριον τοῖς ἐν ἀρχῇ κτίσμασί σου, καὶ
21 ἔγειρον προφητείας τὰς ἐπ᾿ ὀνόματί σου· δὸς μισθὸν τοῖς ὑπομένουσι
22 σε, καὶ οἱ προφῆταί σου ἐμπιστευθήσονται. Εἰσάκουσον Κύριε δεήσεως
23 τῶν ἱκετῶν σου, κατὰ τὴν εὐλογίαν Ἀαρὼν περὶ τοῦ λαοῦ σου· καὶ
24 γνώσονται πάντες οἱ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, ὅτι σὺ Κύριος εἶ ὁ Θεὸς τῶν
25 αἰώνων. Πᾶν βρῶμα φάγεται κοιλία· ἔστι δὲ βρῶμα βρώματος
26 κάλλιον. Φάρυγξ γεύεται βρώματα θήρας· οὕτως καρδία συνετὴ
27 λόγους ψευδεῖς. Καρδία στρεβλὴ δώσει λύπην· καὶ ἄνθρωπος πο-
28 λύπειρος ἀνταποδώσει αὐτῷ. Πάντα ἄῤῥενα ἐπιδέξεται γυνή· ἔστι
29 δὲ θυγάτηρ θυγατρὸς κρεῖσσον. Κάλλος γυναικὸς ἱλαρύνει πρό-
30 σωπον, καὶ ὑπὲρ πᾶσαν ἐπιθυμίαν ἀνθρώπου ὑπεράγει· εἰ ἔστιν ἐπὶ
31 γλώσσης αὐτῆς ἔλεος καὶ πραΰτης καὶ ἴασις, οὐκ ἔστιν ἀνὴρ αὐτῆς
32 καθ᾿ υἱοὺς ἀνθρώπων. Ὁ κτώμενος γυναῖκα ἐνάρχεται κτήσεως,
33 βοηθὸν κατ᾿ αὐτὸν καὶ στύλον ἀναπαύσεως· οὐ οὐκ ἔστι φραγμός,
33 διαπαργήσεται κτῆμα, καὶ οὗ οὐκ ἔστι γυνή, στενάζει πλανώμε-
35 νος. Τίς γὰρ πιστεύσει εὐζώνῳ λῃστῇ ἀφαλλομένῳ ἐκ πόλεως.
36 εἰς πόλιν; οὕτως ἀνθρώπῳ μὴ ἔχοντι νοσσίαν, καὶ καταλύοντι
37 οὗ ἐὰν ὑφήσῃ.

**Chapter Thirty-Six (continued)**

13 of them. As the clay is in the hand of the potter,
    so all His ways are according to His good pleasure.
14 Thus are men in the hand of Him that made them,
15 to render unto them according to His judgment.
    Over against the evil is the good,
    and over against death is life;
16 so also over against the righteous is the sinner.
    And thus do thou meditate upon all the works of the Most High:
    two by two, over against the one.
    (For I, the last, have been vigilant,)
17 and do thou inherit them as from the beginning.
    Have mercy upon Thy people, O Lord,
    who are called by Thy Name;
    and upon Israel, whom Thou didst liken unto Thy firstborn.
18 Pity the city of Thy sanctuary,
    Jerusalem, the place of Thy rest.
19 Fill Zion [that she may] take up Thy oracles,
    and with Thy glory Thy people.
20 Give testimony unto Thy creatures from the beginning,
21 and raise up the prophecies that were spoken in Thy Name.
    Give reward unto them that await Thee,
22 and Thy prophets shall be believed.
    Hearken, O Lord, unto the supplication of Thy suppliants,
23 according to the blessing of Aaron concerning Thy people;
24 and let all upon the earth know
    that Thou, O Lord, art the God of the ages.
25 Every food shall a belly eat;
    yet is there a food better than [another] food.
26 The gullet doth taste the meats of the hunt;
    so a discerning heart [doth taste] false words.
27 A crooked heart shall bring forth sorrow;
    and a man of great experience shall repay it.
28 Every male shall a woman receive;
    yet is there a daughter better than [another] daughter.
29 The beauty of a woman doth gladden the countenance,
30 and it doth surpass every desire of man.
    If there be upon her tongue mercy, and meekness, and healing,
31 then is there no husband of hers among the sons of men.
32 He that acquireth a woman beginneth a possession,
33 a helper according to his nature, and a pillar of rest.
    Where there is no, no hedge, a possession shall be plundered;
    and where there is no woman, he that wandereth doth groan.
35 For who shall trust a girded robber, leaping from city
36 unto city? So also unto a man that hath no nest,
    and doth lodge wheresoever he may pitch [his tent].

**Chapter Thirty-Seven**

1 Every friend shall say, "I also have been a friend";
    yet there is a friend only in name.
2 Is there not sorrow even unto death,
    when a companion and a friend turneth into enmity?
3 O wicked thought, whence didst thou roll in
4 to cover the dry [earth] with deceit?
    A companion to a friend in joy doth delight,
5 and in a time of tribulation he shall stand against [him];
    a companion doth strive with a friend
