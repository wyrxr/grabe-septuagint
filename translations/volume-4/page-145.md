35 παρεκλεισεν οὐκ αἰδεσθεὶς τὸ δίκαιον. Δι’ ἣν αἰτίαν οὐ μόνον
    Ἰουδαῖοι, πολλοὶ δὲ καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ἐθνῶν ἐδείναζον καὶ ἐδυσφό-
    ρουν ἐπὶ τῷ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς ἀδίκῳ φόνῳ. Τοῦ δὲ βασιλέως ἐπανελ-
36 θόντος ἀπὸ τῶν κατὰ Κιλικίαν τόπων, ἐνετύγχανον οἱ κατὰ πό-
    λιν Ἰουδαῖοι, συμμισοπονηροῦντων καὶ τῶν Ἑλλήνων, ὑπὲρ τοῦ
37 παρὰ λόγον τὸν Ὀνίαν ἀπεκτονεῖσθαι. Ψυχικῶς οὖν ὁ Ἀν-
    τίοχος ἐπιλυπηθεὶς καὶ τραπεὶς ἐπὶ ἔλεος, καὶ δακρύσας διὰ τὴν
38 τοῦ μετηλλαχότος σωφροσύνην καὶ πολλὴν εὐταξίαν, καὶ πυρω-
    θεὶς τοῖς θυμοῖς, παραχρῆμα τὴν τοῦ Ἀνδρονίκου πορφύραν πε-
    ριελόμενος, καὶ τοὺς χιτῶνας περιρήξας, περιαγαγὼν καθ’ ὅλην
    τὴν πόλιν ἐπ’ αὐτὸν τὸν τόπον εὗπερ εἰς τὸν Ὀνίαν ἠσέβησεν,
    ἐκεῖ τὸν μιαίφονον ἀπεκόσμησε, τοῦ Κυρίου τὴν ἀξίαν αὐτῷ κό-
39 λασιν ἀποδόντος. Γενομένων δὲ πολλῶν ἱεροσυλημάτων κατὰ
    τὴν πόλιν ὑπὸ τοῦ Λυσιμάχου μετὰ τῆς τοῦ Μενελάου γνώμης,
    καὶ διαδοθείσης ἔξω τῆς φήμης, ἐπισυνήχθη τὸ πλῆθος ἐπὶ τὸν
40 Λυσίμαχον, χρυσωμάτων ἤδη πολλῶν διενηνεγμένων. Ἐπεγει-
    ρομένων δὲ τῶν ὄχλων καὶ ταῖς ἐργάταις διεμπιπλαμένων, καθε-
    πλίσατο ὁ Λυσίμαχος πρὸς τρισχιλίους, κατήρξατο χειρῶν ἀδί-
41 κων, προηγῃσαμένου τινὸς Αὐράνου προβεβηκότος τὴν ἡλικίαν,
    οὐδὲν δὲ ἧττον καὶ τὴν ἄνοιαν. Συνειδότες δὲ καὶ τὴν ἐπίθεσιν
    τοῦ Λυσιμάχου, συναρπάσαντες οἱ μὲν πέτρους, οἱ δὲ ξύλων πά-
42 ντως, τινὲς δὲ ἐκ τῆς παρακειμένης σποδοῦ δραττόμενοι, φόρδην
    ἐνέπετασσον εἰς τοὺς περὶ τὸν Λυσίμαχον. Δι’ ἣν αἰτίαν πολ-
    λοὺς μὲν αὐτῶν τραυματίας ἐποίησαν, τινὰς δὲ κατέβαλον, πάν-
43 τας δὲ εἰς φυγὴν συνέλασαν, αὐτὸν δὲ τὸν ἱερόσυλον παρὰ τὸ
    γαζοφυλάκιον ἐχειρώσαντο. Περὶ δὲ τούτων ἐνέστη κρίσις ἐπὶ
44 τὸν Μενέλαον. Καταντήσαντος δὲ τοῦ βασιλέως εἰς Τύρον, ἐπ’
    αὐτοῦ τὴν δικαιολογίαν ἐποιήσαντο οἱ πεμφθέντες τρεῖς ἄνδρες
45 ὑπὸ τῆς γερουσίας. Ἤδη δὲ λελειμμένος ὁ Μενέλαος ἐπηγγεί-
    λατο χρήματα ἱκανὰ τῷ Πτολεμαίῳ τῷ Δορυμένους πρὸς τὸ
46 πεῖσαι τὸν βασιλέα. Ὅθεν ἀπολαβὼν ὁ Πτολεμαῖος εἴς τι πε-
47 ρίστυλον ὡς ἀναζύγοντα τὸν βασιλέα μετέθηκε. Καὶ τὸν μὲν
    τῆς ὅλης κακίας αἴτιον Μενέλαον ἀπέλυσε τῶν κατηγορημένων,
    τοῖς δὲ ταλαιπώροις, οἵ τινες εἰ καὶ ἐπὶ Σκυθῶν ἔλεγον ἀπε-
48 λύθησαν ἂν ἀκατάγνωστοι, τούτοις θάνατον ἐπέκρινε. Ταχέως

#### CHAPTER IV.

...not reverencing justice, [whereupon]
**35** for which cause not only the Jews, but many also of other nations, did grieve and were sore displeased at the unrighteous murder of the man.
**36** Now when the king had returned from the regions of Cilicia, the Jews throughout the city did petition him, the Greeks also joining with them in their detestation of the wickedness,
**37** concerning Onias, that he had been slain without cause. Therefore, Antiochus, being deeply grieved in his soul and moved to pity,
**38** and having wept for the soberness and great uprightness of him that was departed, and being inflamed with wrath, did straightway strip Andronicus of his purple robe, and tear his garments; and leading him throughout the whole city, unto that very place where he had committed his impiety against Onias, there did he put to death the blood-guilty man, the Lord rendering unto him his just recompense.
**39** Now when many acts of sacrilege had been committed in the city by Lysimachus with the consent of Menelaus, and the report thereof had spread abroad, the multitude gathered themselves together against Lysimachus, for much of the golden vessels had already been carried away [from the Temple].
**40** And as the crowds were roused and the common folk were mingled [among them], Lysimachus did arm himself with about three thousand [men], and did begin to lay violent hands [upon the people],
**41** being led by a certain Auranus, who was advanced in years, yet no less advanced in folly. But they, perceiving also the assault of Lysimachus, did snatch up some stones, and some, in any wise, timbers,
**42** and others, seizing of the ashes that lay nearby, did cast them pell-mell upon those who were about Lysimachus. For which cause, many of them did they wound, and some they struck down,
**43** and all they drove to flight; but the sacrilegious man himself did they lay hands on beside the treasury. And concerning these matters a judgment was brought
**44** against Menelaus. Now when the king had arrived at Tyre, the three men sent by the council of elders did make their defense
**45** before him. Now Menelaus, being already overcome [in argument], did promise a sufficient sum of money unto Ptolemy, the son of Dorymenes,
**46** that he might persuade the king. Whereupon Ptolemy, having received [the money], did remove the king unto a certain peristyle,
**47** as one about to make ready for his journey. And Menelaus, who was the author of all this mischief, did he absolve from the accusations; but unto those wretched men,
**48** who, even if they had spoken before Scythians, would have been acquitted as innocent, unto these did he adjudge death. Therefore, did they quickly suffer the unjust penalty, even they who had spoken on behalf of the city and of the people and of...
