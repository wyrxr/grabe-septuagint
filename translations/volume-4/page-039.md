πάντες οἱ θεράποντες αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἰσήγαγον αὐτὴν εἰς τὴν σκη-
21 νήν. Καὶ ἦν Ὁλοφέρνης ἀναπαυόμενος ἐπὶ τῆς κλίνης αὐτοῦ ἐν
τῷ κωνωπείῳ, ὃ ἦν ἐκ πορφύρας καὶ χρυσίου καὶ σμαράγδου καὶ
22 λίθων πολυτελῶν καθυφασμένων. Καὶ ἀνήγγειλαν αὐτῷ περὶ αὐ-
τῆς, καὶ ἐξῆλθεν εἰς τὸ προσκήνιον, καὶ λαμπάδες ἀργυραῖ προά-
23 γουσαι αὐτοῦ. Ὡς δὲ ἦλθε κατὰ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ Ἰουδὶθ καὶ τῶν
θεραπόντων αὐτοῦ, ἐθαύμασαν πάντες ἐπὶ τῷ κάλλει τοῦ προσώ-
που αὐτῆς. καὶ πεσοῦσα ἐπὶ πρόσωπον προσεκύνησεν αὐτῷ· καὶ
ἤγειραν αὐτὴν οἱ δοῦλοι αὐτοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΑ΄. ΧΙ.

1 ΚΑΙ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτὴν Ὁλοφέρνης· θάρσησον, γύναι, μὴ φοβηθῇς
τῇ καρδίᾳ σου, ὅτι ἐγὼ οὐκ ἐκάκωσα ἄνθρωπον ὅστις ἠρέτικε
2 δουλεύειν βασιλεῖ Ναβουχοδονόσορ πάσης τῆς γῆς. Καὶ νῦν
ὁ λαός σου ὁ κατοικῶν τὴν ὀρεινήν, εἰ μὴ ἐφαύλισέ με, οὐκ ἂν
ἦρα τὸ δόρυ μου ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς, ἀλλὰ αὐτοὶ ἑαυτοῖς ἐποίησαν ταῦτα.
3 Καὶ νῦν λέγε μοι τίνος ἕνεκα ἀπέδρας ἀπ᾽ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἦλθες πρὸς
ἡμᾶς· ἥκεις γὰρ εἰς σωτηρίαν. Θάρσει, ἐν τῇ νυκτὶ ταύτῃ ζήσῃ,
4 καὶ εἰς τὸ λοιπόν. Οὐ γὰρ ἔστιν ὃς ἀδικήσει σε, ἀλλ᾽ εὖ σε ποιήσει
καθὰ γίνεται τοῖς δούλοις τοῦ κυρίου μου βασιλέως Ναβου-
5 χοδονόσορ. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτὸν Ἰουδὶθ· δέξαι τὰ ῥήματα τῆς
δούλης σου, καὶ λαλησάτω ἡ παιδίσκη σου κατὰ πρόσωπόν σου,
6 καὶ οὐκ ἀναγγελῶ ψεῦδος τῷ κυρίῳ μου ἐν τῇ νυκτὶ ταύτῃ. Καὶ
ἐὰν κατακολουθήσῃς τοῖς λόγοις τῆς παιδίσκης σου, τελείως
πρᾶγμα ποιήσει μετά σου ὁ Θεός, καὶ οὐκ ἀποπεσεῖται ὁ κύριός
7 μου τῶν ἐπιτηδευμάτων αὐτοῦ. Ζῇ γὰρ ὁ βασιλεὺς πάσης τῆς
γῆς Ναβουχοδονόσορ, καὶ ζῇ τὸ κράτος αὐτοῦ, ὃς ἀπέστειλέ σε
εἰς κατόρθωσιν πάσης ψυχῆς, ὅτι οὐ μόνον ἄνθρωποι διὰ σὲ δου-
λεύουσιν αὐτῷ, ἀλλὰ καὶ τὰ θηρία τοῦ ἀγροῦ, καὶ τὰ κτήνη,
καὶ τὰ πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ διὰ τῆς ἰσχύος σου ζήσονται ἐπὶ Να-
8 βουχοδονόσορ, καὶ πάντα τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ. Ἠκούσαμεν γὰρ τὴν
σοφίαν σου, καὶ τὰ πανουργεύματα τῆς ψυχῆς σου, ἃ καὶ ἀνηγγέλθη
πάσῃ τῇ γῇ, ὅτι σὺ μόνος ἀγαθὸς ἐν πάσῃ τῇ βασιλείᾳ,
καὶ δυνατὸς ἐν ἐπιστήμῃ, καὶ θαυμαστὸς ἐν στρατεύμασι πολέ-
9 μου. Καὶ νῦν ὁ λόγος ὃν ἐλάλησεν Ἀχιὼρ ἐν τῇ συνεδρείᾳ σου,

#### CHAPTER 10

**20** [And there came forth they that attended Holofernes,] and all his servants, and they led her into the tent.

**21** And Holofernes lay at rest upon his bed within his pavilion, which was woven of purple, and gold, and emerald, and

**22** costly stones. And they reported unto him concerning her, and he came forth into the fore-tent, with silver lamps borne before him.

**23** Now when Judith came before his face, and the faces of his servants, they all marvelled at the beauty of her countenance. And she fell upon her face and did obeisance unto him; and his servants raised her up.

#### CHAPTER 11

**1** Then Holofernes said unto her: "Be of good courage, O woman; let not thy heart be afraid, for I have dealt no harm unto any man who hath chosen to serve King Nebuchadnezzar, the lord of all the earth.

**2** And now, thy people that inhabit the hill country, had they not despised me, I should not have lifted my spear against them; but they themselves have brought these things upon themselves.

**3** And now tell me, for what cause didst thou flee from them, and hast come unto us? For thou art come unto salvation. Be of good courage, for in this very night shalt thou live,

**4** and for the time to come. For there is none who shall do thee wrong, but he shall deal well with thee, even as it is done unto the servants of my lord, King Nebuchadnezzar."

**5** Then Judith said unto him: "Receive, I pray thee, the words of thy handmaiden, and let thy servant speak before thy face,

**6** and I shall not declare a lie unto my lord in this night. And if thou wilt follow the words of thy handmaiden, God shall bring [to] a perfect pass the matter with thee; and my lord shall not fail of his undertakings.

**7** For as King Nebuchadnezzar, the lord of all the earth, liveth, and as his power liveth—he that hath sent thee for the setting aright of every soul—so it is that not only men through thee do serve him, but also the beasts of the field, and the cattle, and the fowls of the heaven, through thy might shall live under [the dominion of] Nebuchadnezzar, and all his house.

**8** For we have heard of thy wisdom, and the shrewdness of thy soul, which hath been reported throughout all the earth; for thou alone art good within all the kingdom, and mighty in knowledge, and wondrous in the armies of war.

**9** And now, the word which Achior spake in thy council,
