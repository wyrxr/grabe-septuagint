**11** πάντων τῶν αὐτοῦ. πεῖσον δὴ πορευθῆναι τὴν ἐρημίαν ᾗ ἐστι παρὰ σοί, τοῦ ἐλθεῖν πρὸς ἡμᾶς, καὶ φαγεῖν καὶ πιεῖν μεθ᾿ ἡμῶν. **12** Ἰδοὺ γὰρ αἰσχρὸν τὸ πρόσωπον ἡμῶν, εἰ γυναῖκα τοιαύτην παρήσομεν οὐχ ὁμιλήσαντες αὐτῇ, ὅτι ἐὰν ταύτην μὴ ἐπισπασώμεθα, καταγελάσεται ἡμῶν. **13** Καὶ ἐξῆλθε Βαγώας ἀπὸ προσώπου Ὁλοφέρνου, καὶ εἰσῆλθε πρὸς αὐτήν, καὶ εἶπε· μὴ ἐκνησάτω δὴ ἡ παιδίσκη ἡ καλὴ αὕτη ἐλθοῦσα πρὸς τὸν κύριόν μου, δοξασθῆναι κατὰ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ, καὶ πιεῖν μεθ᾿ ἡμῶν εἰς εὐφροσύνην οἶνον, καὶ γενηθῆναι ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ταύτῃ, ὡς θυγάτηρ μία τῶν υἱῶν Ἀσσούρ, αἳ παρεστήκασιν ἐν οἴκῳ Ναβουχοδονόσορ. **14** Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτὸν Ἰουδίθ· καὶ τίς εἰμι ἐγὼ ἀντεροῦσα τῷ κυρίῳ μου; ὅτι πᾶν ὃ ἔσται ἐν τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτοῦ ἀρεστόν, σπεύσασα ποιήσω, καὶ ἔσται μοι τοῦτο ἀγαλίαμα ἕως ἡμέρας θανάτου μου. **15** Καὶ ἀναστᾶσα ἐκοσμήθη τῷ ἱματισμῷ καὶ παντὶ τῷ κόσμῳ τῷ γυναικείῳ, καὶ προσῆλθεν ἡ δούλη αὐτῆς, καὶ ἔστρωσεν αὐτῇ ἐναντίον Ὁλοφέρνου χαμαὶ τὰ κώδια, ἃ ἔλαβε παρὰ Βαγώου εἰς τὴν καθημερινὴν δίαιταν αὐτῆς, εἰς τὸ ἐσθίειν κατακλινομένη ἐπ᾿ αὐτῶν. **16** Καὶ εἰσελθούσα ἀνέπεσεν Ἰουδίθ, καὶ ἐξέστη ἡ καρδία Ὁλοφέρνου ἐπ᾿ αὐτήν, καὶ ἐσαλεύθη ἡ ψυχὴ αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἦν κατεπιθύμος σφόδρα τοῦ συγγενέσθαι μετ᾿ αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐτήρει καιρὸν τοῦ ἀπατῆσαι αὐτήν, ἀφ᾿ ἧς ἡμέρας εἶδεν αὐτήν. **17** Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτὴν Ὁλοφέρνης· πίε δή, καὶ γενήθητι μεθ᾿ ἡμῶν εἰς εὐφροσύνην. **18** Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰουδίθ· πίομαι δή, κύριε, ὅτι ἐμεγαλύνθη τὸ ζῆν μου ἐν ἐμοὶ σήμερον παρὰ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς γενέσεώς μου. **19** Καὶ λαβοῦσα ἔπιε καὶ ἔφαγε κατέναντι αὐτοῦ ἃ ἡτοίμασεν ἡ δούλη αὐτῆς. **20** Καὶ ηὐφράνθη Ὁλοφέρνης ἀπ᾿ αὐτῆς, καὶ ἔπιεν οἶνον πολὺν σφόδρα, ὃσον οὐκ ἔπιε πώποτε ἐν ἡμέρᾳ μιᾷ ἀφ᾿ οὗ ἐγεννήθη.

**1** Ὡς δὲ ὀψία ἐγένετο, ἐσπούδασαν οἱ δοῦλοι αὐτοῦ ἀναλύειν, καὶ Βαγώας συνέκλεισε τὴν σκηνὴν ἔξωθεν, καὶ ἀπέκλεισε τοὺς παρεστῶτας ἐκ προσώπου τοῦ κυρίου αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀπώχοντο εἰς τὰς κοίτας αὐτῶν· ἦσαν γὰρ πάντες κεκοπωμένοι, διὰ τὸ ἐπὶ πλεῖον γεγονέναι τὸν πότον. **2** Ὑπελείφθη δὲ Ἰουδίθ μόνη ἐν τῇ

#### CHAPTER 12

**11** all his [possessions]. Persuade now her, who is in privacy with thee, to come unto us, and to eat and drink with us. **12** For lo, it is a shame unto our countenance, if we should suffer such a woman to pass by, not having conversed with her; for if we do not draw her [unto us], she will surely laugh us to scorn."

**13** And Bagoas went forth from the presence of Holofernes, and entered in unto her, and said, "Let not this fair handmaiden now delay, but come unto my lord, that she may be glorified in his presence, and drink wine with us unto gladness, and be made this day as one daughter of the sons of Asshur, who stand in the house of King Nebuchadnezzar."

**14** And Judith said unto him, "And who am I, that I should gainsay my lord? For whatsoever shall be pleasing in his eyes, I will make haste to do [it], and this shall be to me a joy until the day of my death."

**18** And Judith said, "I will indeed drink, my lord; for my life hath been magnified within me this day, beyond all the days of my birth."

**19** And having taken [it], she drank and ate before him that which her handmaiden had prepared.

**20** And Holofernes rejoiced because of her, and drank very much wine, as much as he had never drunk in one day since the day he was born.

#### CHAPTER 13

**1** And when it was evening, his servants made haste to depart, and Bagoas shut the tent from without, and locked out those who stood in the presence of his lord, and they went away to their beds; for they were all wearied, because the drinking had been prolonged beyond measure. **2** But Judith was left alone in the tent,
