56. ἐν ταῖς πλατείαις ἐθυμίων. Καὶ τὰ βιβλία τοῦ νόμου, ἃ εὗρον,
57. ἐνεπύρισαν πυρὶ κατασχίσαντες. Καὶ ὅπου εὑρίσκετο παρά τινι
58. βιβλίον διαθήκης, καὶ εἴ τις συνευδόκει τῷ νόμῳ, τὸ σύγκριμα τοῦ
59. βασιλέως ἐθανάτου αὐτόν. Ἐν ἰσχύϊ αὐτῶν ἐποίουν οὕτω τῷ Ἰσραήλ,
60. τοῖς εὑρισκομένοις ἐν παντὶ μηνὶ καὶ μηνὶ ἐν ταῖς πόλεσι.
61. Καὶ τῇ πέμπτῃ καὶ εἰκάδι τοῦ μηνὸς θυσιάζοντες ἐπὶ τὸν
62. βωμόν, ὃς ἦν ἐπὶ τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου. Καὶ τὰς γυναῖκας τὰς περιτετμηκυίας
63. τὰ τέκνα αὐτῶν ἐθανάτωσαν κατὰ τὸ πρόσταγμα. Καὶ
64. ἐκρέμασαν τὰ βρέφη ἐκ τῶν τραχήλων αὐτῶν, καὶ τοὺς οἰκείους
65. αὐτῶν προενόμευσαν, καὶ τοὺς περιτετμηκότας αὐτοὺς ἐθανάτωσαν.
66. Καὶ πολλοὶ ἐν Ἰσραὴλ ἐκραταιώθησαν, καὶ ὠχυρώθησαν ἐν
67. αὐτοῖς τοῦ μὴ φαγεῖν κοινά. Καὶ ἐπελέξαντο ἀποθανεῖν, ἵνα μὴ
68. μιανθῶσι τοῖς βρώμασι, καὶ μὴ βεβηλώσωσι διαθήκην ἁγίαν, καὶ
69. ἀπέθανον. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὀργὴ μεγάλη ἐπὶ Ἰσραὴλ σφόδρα.

**ΚΕΦ. Βʹ. ΙΙ.**

1. ΕΝ ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις, ἀνέστη Ματταθίας Ἰωάννου τοῦ
2. Συμεὼν ἱερεὺς τῶν υἱῶν Ἰωαρείμ ἀπὸ Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἐκάθισεν
3. ἐν Μωδεεΐν. Καὶ αὐτῷ υἱοὶ πέντε Ἰωάννης ὁ ἐπικαλούμενος Γαδδίς,
4. Σίμων ὁ καλούμενος Θασσίς, Ἰούδας ὁ καλούμενος Μακκαβαῖος,
5. Ἐλεάζαρ ὁ καλούμενος Αὐαράν, Ἰωναθᾶς ὁ καλούμενος
6. Σαφφοῦς. Καὶ ἴδε τὰς βλασφημίας τὰς γινομένας ἐν Ἰούδα καὶ
7. ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ· καὶ εἶπεν οἴμοι, ἵνατί τοῦτο ἐγενήθην ἰδεῖν τὰ
8. συντρίμματα τοῦ λαοῦ μου, καὶ τὸ σύντριμμα τῆς πόλεως τῆς ἁγίας,
9. καὶ καθίσαι ἐκεῖ ἐν τῷ δοθῆναι αὐτὴν ἐν χειρὶ ἐχθρῶν, καὶ
10. τὸ ἁγίασμα ἐν χειρὶ ἀλλοτρίων ; Ἐγένετο ὁ ναὸς αὐτῆς ὡς ἀνὴρ
11. ἄδοξος, τὰ σκεύη τῆς δόξης αὐτῆς αἰχμάλωτα ἀπήχθη· ἀπεκτάνθη
12. τὰ νήπια αὐτῆς ἐν ταῖς πλατείαις αὐτῆς, οἱ νεανίσκοι αὐτῆς ἐν
13. ῥομφαίᾳ ἐχθροῦ. Ποῖον ἔθνος οὐκ ἐκληρονόμησε βασιλείαν αὐτῆς,
14. καὶ οὐκ ἐκράτησε τῶν σκύλων αὐτῆς ; Πᾶς ὁ κόσμος αὐτῆς ἀφηρέθη,
15. ἀντὶ ἐλευθέρας ἐγενήθη εἰς δούλην. Καὶ ἰδοὺ τὰ ἅγια
16. ἡμῶν καὶ ἡ καλλονὴ ἡμῶν καὶ ἡ δόξα ἡμῶν ἠρημώθη, καὶ ἐβεβήλωσαν
17. αὐτὰ τὰ ἔθνη. Ἵνατί ἡμῖν ἔτι ζῆν ; Καὶ διέρρηξε Ματταθίας
18. καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτῶν, καὶ περιεβάλοντο
19. σάκκους, καὶ ἐπένθησαν σφόδρα. Καὶ ἦλθον οἱ παρὰ τοῦ βασιλέως

**Chapter 1**
**56** in the streets did they burn incense. And the books of the Law, which they found,
**57** these did they tear asunder and consume with fire. And wheresoever was found with any man
**58** a book of the covenant, or if any man did consent unto the Law, the decree of the
**59** king did put him to death. In their might did they thus unto Israel,
**60** unto those found in every month and month in the cities.
**61** And on the five and twentieth day of the month did they sacrifice upon the
**62** [heathen] altar, which stood upon the [Lord's] altar. And the women who had circumcised
**63** their children, them did they put to death according to the king's decree. And
**64** they hanged the infants from their necks, and their households did they ravage,
**65** and those who had circumcised them did they put to death.
**66** And many in Israel were strengthened, and waxed strong within
**67** themselves, that they might not eat that which was unclean. And they chose rather to die, that they might not
**68** be defiled with meats, nor yet profane the holy covenant, and
**69** so they died. And there was great wrath upon Israel, exceedingly.

**Chapter 2**

**1** IN those days there arose Mattathias, the son of John, the son of Simeon,
**2** a priest of the sons of Joarib, from Jerusalem, and he dwelt
**3** in Modein. And he had five sons: John, whose surname was Gaddis;
**4** Simon, who was called Thassi; Judas, who was called Maccabaeus;
**5** Eleazar, whose surname was Avaran; Jonathan, whose surname was
**6** Sapphous. And he beheld the blasphemies that were wrought in Judah and
**7** in Jerusalem. And he said, "Woe is me! Wherefore was I born to see the
**8** crushing of my people, and the utter ruin of the holy city,
**9** and to abide therein when she was delivered into the hand of her enemies, and
**10** the sanctuary into the hand of strangers? Her temple is become as a man
**11** without renown, the vessels of her glory are carried away captive. Her infants were slain
**12** in her streets, and her young men by the sword of the enemy.
**13** What nation hath not inherited her kingdom,
**14** and hath not laid hold of her spoils? All her beauty and comeliness is taken away;
**15** and instead of a free woman, she is made a bondwoman. And lo, our holy [places],
**16** and our beauty, and our glory are laid waste, and the Gentiles have defiled them.
**17** Wherefore should we live yet longer?" Then Mattathias
**18** and his sons tore their garments, and put on
**19** sackcloth, and mourned exceeding greatly. And there came from the king [men]
