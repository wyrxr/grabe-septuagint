**ΚΕΦ. ΛΖ´ ΙΗΣΟΥ ΥΙΟΥ ΣΙΡΑΧ 1833**
6 πονεῖ χάριν γαστρός, ἀπέναντι πολεμίου λήψεται ἀσπίδα. Μὴ ἐπι-
λάθου φίλου ἐν τῇ ψυχῇ σου, καὶ μὴ ἀμνημονήσῃς αὐτοῦ ἐν χρη-
μασί σου. Πᾶς σύμβουλος ἐξαίρει βουλήν· ἀλλ᾽ ἐστι συμβουλεύων 7
εἰς ἑαυτόν. Ἀπὸ συμβούλου φύλαξον τὴν ψυχήν σου, καὶ γνῶθι 8
πρότερον τίς αὐτοῦ χρεία (καὶ γὰρ αὐτὸς ἑαυτῷ βουλεύσεται,)
μήποτε βάλῃ ἐπὶ σοὶ σκληρὰν, καὶ εἴπῃ σοι· καλή ἡ ὁδός σου· 9
καὶ στήσεται ἐξ ἐναντίας ἰδεῖν τὸ συμβησόμενόν σοι. Μὴ βουλεύου 10
μετὰ τοῦ ὑποβλεπομένου σε, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ζηλούντων σε κρύψον
βουλήν· μετὰ γυναικὸς περὶ τῆς ἀντιζήλου αὐτῆς, καὶ μετὰ δειλοῦ 11
περὶ πολέμου, μετὰ ἐμπόρου περὶ μεταβολίας, καὶ μετὰ ἀγο-
ράζοντος περὶ πράσεως, μετὰ βαρεκάκου περὶ εὐχαριστίας, καὶ
μετὰ ἀνελέημονος περὶ χρηστοηθείας, μετὰ ὀχνηροῦ περὶ παν-
τὸς ἔργου, καὶ μετὰ μισθίου ἐπετείου περὶ συντελείας, οἰκέτῃ
ἀργῷ περὶ πολλῆς ἐργασίας· μὴ ἔπεχε ἐπὶ τούτοις περὶ πάσης
συμβουλίας. Ἀλλ᾽ ἢ μετὰ ἀνδρὸς εὐσεβοῦς ἐνδελεχίζε, ὃν ἂν ἐπι- 12
γνῶς συντηροῦντα ἐντολὰς Κυρίου, ὃς ἐν τῇ ψυχῇ αὐτοῦ κατὰ
τὴν ψυχήν σου, καὶ ἐὰν πταίσῃς, συναλγήσει σοι. Καὶ βουλὴν καρ- 13
δίας στῆσον, οὐ γὰρ ἐστί σοι πιστότερος αὐτῆς· ψυχὴ γὰρ ἀνδρὸς 14
ἀπαγγέλλειν ἐνίοτε εἴωθεν, ἡ ἑπτὰ σκοποὶ ἐπὶ μετεώρου καθήμε-
νοι ἐπὶ σκοπῆς. Καὶ ἐπὶ πᾶσι τούτοις δεηθιτι ὑψίστου, ἵνα εὐ- 15
θύνῃ ἐν ἀληθείᾳ τὴν ἔδόν σου. Ἀρχὴ παντὸς ἔργου λόγος, καὶ 16
πρὸ πάσης πράξεως βουλή. Ἴχνος ἀλλοιώσεως καρδίας τέσσαρα 17.18
μέρη ἀνατέλλει, ἀγαθὸν καὶ κακὸν, ζωὴ καὶ θάνατος· καὶ ἡ κυ-
ριεύουσα ἐνδελεχῶς αὐτῶν γλῶσσα ἐστίν. Ἔστιν ἀνὴρ πανουρ- 19
γος πολλῶν παιδευτής, καὶ τῇ ἰδίᾳ ψυχῇ ἐστιν ἄχρηστος. Ἔστι 20
σοφιζόμενος ἐν λόγοις μισητός· οὗτος πάσης τροφῆς καθυστε-
ρήσει· οὐ γὰρ ἐδόθη αὐτῷ παρὰ Κυρίου χάρις, ὅτι πάσης σοφίας 21
ἐστερήθη. Ἔστι σοφὸς τῇ ἰδίᾳ ψυχῇ, καὶ οἱ καρποὶ τῆς συνέσεως 22
αὐτοῦ ἐπαινετοί. Ἀνὴρ σοφὸς τὸν ἑαυτοῦ λαὸν παιδεύσει, καὶ οἱ 23
καρποὶ τῆς συνέσεως αὐτοῦ πιστοί. Ἀνὴρ σοφὸς ἐμπλησθήσεται 24
εὐλογίας, καὶ μακαριοῦσιν αὐτὸν πάντες οἱ ὁρῶντες. Ζωὴ ἀνδρὸς 25
ἐν ἀριθμῷ ἡμερῶν· καὶ αἱ ἡμέραι τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ ἀναρίθμητοι. Ὁ 26
σοφὸς ἐν τῷ λαῷ αὐτοῦ κληρονομήσει πίστιν, καὶ τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ
ζήσει εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα. Τέκνον ἐν ζωῇ σου πείρασον τὴν ψυχήν σου, 27
καὶ ἴδε τί πονηρὸν αὐτῇ, καὶ μὴ δῶς αὐτῇ· οὐ γὰρ πάντα πᾶσι 28
συμφέρει, καὶ οὐ πᾶσα ψυχὴ ἐν παντὶ εὐδοκεῖ. Μὴ ἁπληστεύου ἐν 29

**Chapter Thirty-Seven**

6 doth toil for the belly's sake;
    but against an enemy shall he take up a shield.
    Forget not a friend in thy soul,
    and be not unmindful of him in thy substance.
7 Every counselor doth extol [his own] counsel;
    but there is one that counselleth for himself.
8 From a counselor guard thy soul,
    and know beforehand what is his need;
    (for he himself will also counsel for himself,)
9 lest he cast upon thee a harsh [burden],
    and say unto thee, "Thy way is good";
    and he shall stand afar off to see what shall befall thee.
10 Counsel not with him that looketh askance at thee;
    and from those that envy thee, hide thy counsel:
11 with a woman concerning her rival,
    and with a coward concerning war,
    with a merchant concerning [his] exchange,
    and with a buyer concerning a sale,
    with an envious man concerning gratitude,
    and with a merciless man concerning kindness,
    with a hesitant man concerning any work,
    and with an annual hireling concerning [his] completion,
    with an idle servant concerning much labor;
    upon none of these do thou rely for any counsel.
12 But rather with a pious man do thou constantly associate,
    whomsoever thou knowest to observe the commandments of the Lord,
    whose soul is as thine own soul,
    and if thou stumble, he will grieve with thee.
13 And establish the counsel of thine own heart;
    for there is nothing more faithful unto thee than it.
14 For the soul of a man is sometimes wont to report,
    the seven scouts seated on high upon the watchtower.
15 And for all these things, pray thou unto the Most High,
    that He may straighten in truth thy way.
16 The beginning of every work is a word,
    and before every action, counsel.
17.18 A trace of the heart's alteration bringeth forth four parts:
    good and evil, life and death;
    and that which continually ruleth over them is the tongue.
19 There is a cunning man, a discipler of many;
    yet to his own soul is he unprofitable.
20 There is one that feigneth wisdom in words, and is hateful;
    he shall be deprived of every food.
    For grace was not given him from the Lord,
    because he was bereft of all wisdom.
22 There is one wise for his own soul,
    and the fruits of his understanding are praiseworthy.
23 A wise man shall instruct his own people,
    and the fruits of his understanding are faithful.
24 A wise man shall be filled with blessing,
    and all that behold him shall bless him.
25 The life of a man is [reckoned] in the number of days;
    but the days of Israel are without number.
26 The wise man among his people shall inherit faith,
    and his name shall live for evermore.
27 My son, in thy lifetime, test thy soul,
    and see what is evil for it, and yield it not unto it.
28 For not all things are expedient for all men,
    and not every soul is pleased with every [thing].
29 Be not gluttonous in every luxury,
    and pour not thyself out upon dainties.
