    καὶ τῶν νομίμων ἡμῶν. Καὶ αὐτὸς συντρίψει αὐτοὺς πρὸ προσώπου 22
    ἡμῶν· ὑμεῖς δὲ μὴ φοβηθῆτε ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν. Ὡς δὲ ἐπαύσατο 23
    λαλῶν, ἐνήλατο ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς ἄφνω, καὶ συνετρίβη Σήρων καὶ ἡ
    παρεμβολὴ αὐτοῦ ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐδίωκον αὐτοὺς ἐν τῇ κα- 24
    ταβάσει Βαιθωρὼν ἕως τοῦ πεδίου· καὶ ἔπεσον ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν εἰς ἄν-
    δρας ὀκτακοσίους· οἱ δὲ λοιποὶ ἔφυγον εἰς γῆν Φυλιστιείμ. Καὶ 25
    ἤρξατο ὁ φόβος Ἰούδα καὶ τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἡ πτόη ἐπιπίπτειν
    ἐπὶ τὰ ἔθνη τὰ κύκλῳ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἤγγισεν ἕως τοῦ βα- 26
    σιλέως τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὑπὲρ τῶν παρατάξεων Ἰούδα ἐξηγεῖτο
    πᾶν ἔθνος. Ὡς δὲ ἤκουσεν Ἀντίοχος ὁ βασιλεὺς τοὺς λόγους 27
    τούτους, ὠργίσθη θυμῷ· καὶ ἀπέστειλε καὶ συνήγαγε τὰς δυνάμεις
    πάσας τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ, παρεμβολὴν ἰσχυρὰν σφόδρα,
    καὶ ἤνοιξε τὸ γαζοφυλάκιον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔδωκεν ὀψώνια ταῖς δυ- 28
    νάμεσιν αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸν ἐνιαυτόν· καὶ ἐνετείλατο αὐτοῖς εἰς ἑνιαυτόν
    εἶναι ἑτοίμους εἰς πᾶσαν χρείαν. Καὶ ἴδεν ὅτι ἐξέλειπε 29
    τὸ ἀργύριον ἀπὸ τῶν θησαυρῶν· καὶ οἱ φόροι τῆς χώρας ὀλίγοι,
    χάριν τῆς διχοστασίας καὶ πληγῆς ἧς κατεσκεύασεν ἐν τῇ γῇ, τοῦ
    ἆραι τὰ νόμιμα ἃ ἦσαν ἀφ᾽ ἡμερῶν τῶν πρώτων. Καὶ εὐλαβήθη 30
    μὴ οὐκ ἔχῃ ὡς ἅπαξ καὶ δίς· εἰς τὰς δαπάνας καὶ τὰ δόματα
    ἃ ἐδίδου ἔμπροσθεν δαψιλεῖ χειρί, καὶ ἐπερίσσευσεν ὑπὲρ τοὺς
    βασιλεῖς τοὺς ἔμπροσθεν. Καὶ ἠπορεῖτο τῇ ψυχῇ αὐτοῦ σφόδρα, 31
    καὶ ἐβουλεύσατο τοῦ πορευθῆναι εἰς τὴν Περσίδα, καὶ λαβεῖν τοὺς
    φόρους τῶν χωρῶν, καὶ συναγαγεῖν ἀργύριον πολύ. Καὶ κατέλειπε 32
    Λυσίαν ἄνθρωπον ἔνδοξον καὶ ἀπὸ γένους τῆς βασιλείας
    ἐπὶ τῶν πραγμάτων τοῦ βασιλέως ἀπὸ τοῦ ποταμοῦ Εὐφράτου,
    ἕως τῶν ὁρίων Αἰγύπτου. Καὶ τρέφειν Ἀντίοχον τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ 33
    ἕως τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι αὐτόν. Καὶ παρέδωκεν αὐτῷ τὰς ἡμίσεις 34
    τῶν δυνάμεων καὶ τοὺς ἐλέφαντας, καὶ ἐνετείλατο αὐτῷ περὶ πάντων
    τῶν ἐβούλετο, καὶ περὶ πάντων τῶν κατοικούντων τὴν Ἰου-
    δαίαν καὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ, ἀποστεῖλαι ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς δύναμιν, τοῦ ἐκτρίψαι 35
    καὶ ἐξᾶραι τὴν ἰσχὺν Ἰσραὴλ καὶ τὸ κατάλειμμα Ἱερουσα-
    λήμ, καὶ ἆραι τὸ μνημόσυνον αὐτῶν ἀπὸ τοῦ τόπου, καὶ κατοι- 36
    κίσαι υἱοὺς ἀλλοτρίους ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς ὁρίοις αὐτῶν, καὶ κατακληρονομῆσαι
    τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν. Καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς παρέλαβε τὰς ἡμίσεις 37
    τῶν δυνάμεων τὰς καταλειφθείσας· καὶ ἀπῆρεν ἀπὸ Ἀντιοχείας
    ἀπὸ πόλεως βασιλείας αὐτοῦ, ἔτους ἑβδόμου καὶ τεσσαρακοστοῦ

    **Chapter 3**

    **22** and for our laws. And He Himself shall crush them before our face; but ye, be not afraid of them."
    **23** Now when he had ceased to speak, he leaped upon them suddenly; and Seron was broken, and his host before his face.
    **24** And they pursued them down the descent of Beth-horon, even unto the plain; and there fell of them about eight hundred men; but the remnant fled into the land of Philistim.
    **25** And the fear of Judas and of his brethren began, and a dread fell upon the nations round about him.
    **26** And his name drew nigh even unto the king, and every nation declared concerning the battles of Judas.
    **27** Now when Antiochus the king heard these words, he was filled with a great wrath; and he sent forth and gathered all the forces of his kingdom, a very mighty host,
    **28** and he opened his treasury, and gave wages unto his forces for a year; and he commanded them for a year to be ready for every need.
    **29** And he saw that the silver was spent from the treasuries; and the tributes of the land were few, by reason of the dissension and the plague which he had brought upon the land, to abolish the laws which were from the former days.
    **30** And he became anxious lest he should not have [the means] as he had once and twice [provided]; for the expenses and the gifts which he had bestowed aforetime with a bounteous hand, and had surpassed the kings that were before him.
    **31** And he was greatly perplexed in his soul, and determined to journey into Persia, and to receive the tributes of the countries, and to gather much silver.
    **32** And he left Lysias, an illustrious man and of the royal lineage, in charge of the king's affairs, from the river Euphrates, even unto the borders of Egypt.
    **33** And [he commanded him] to nourish Antiochus his son until he should return.
    **34** And he delivered unto him half of the forces and the elephants, and gave him charge concerning all things that he willed, and concerning all them that dwelt in Judea and Jerusalem,
    **35** [namely], to send forth a force against them, to utterly destroy and to root out the strength of Israel and the remnant of Jerusalem, and to take away their memorial from the place,
    **36** and to settle strangers in all their borders, and to cause their land to be inherited [by them].
    **37** And the king took the half of the forces that were left; and he departed from Antioch, from the city of his kingdom, in the forty-seventh year.
