ἀπικυήσασα. Οὐ μετέτρεψέν σε πρωτότοκος ἀποπνέων οὐδὲ δεύ-
τερος εἰς σὲ οἴκτρων βλέπων ἐν βασάνοις· οὐδὲ τρίτος ἀποψύ-
χων. Οὐδὲ τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς ἑνὸς ἑκάστου θεωροῦσα ταυρηδὸν ἐπὶ
τῶν βασάνων δρῶντας τὸν ἑαυτῶν αἰκισμόν, καὶ τοὺς μυκτή-
ρας προσσημειουμένους αὐτῶν τὸν θάνατον, οὐκ ἔκλαυσας. Ἐπὶ
σαρξὶν τέκνων δρῶσα σάρκας τέκνων ἀποκαισμένας, καὶ ἐπὶ γερ-
σὶν χεῖρας ἀποτεμνομένας, καὶ ἐπὶ κεφαλῆς κεφαλὰς ἀποδειρο-
τομουμένας, καὶ ἐπὶ νεκροῖς νεκροὺς πίπτοντας, καὶ πολυάνδριον
ὁρῶσα τῶν τέκνων τὸ χορεῖον διὰ τῶν βασάνων, οὐκ ἐδάκρυσας.
Οὐχ οὕτως σειρήνειοι μελῳδίαι, οὐδὲ κύκνειοι πρὸς φιληκοΐαν φω-
ναὶ τοὺς ἀκούοντας ἐρέλκονται, ὡς τέκνων φωναὶ μετὰ βασά-
νων μητέρα φωνούντων. Πηλίκαις καὶ πόσαις τότε ἡ μήτηρ,
τῶν υἱῶν βασανιζομένων τροχοῖς τε καὶ κευτρίοις ἐβασανίζετο
βασάνοις; Ἀλλὰ τὰ σπλάγχνα αὐτῆς ὁ εὐσεβὴς λογισμὸς ἐν
αὐτοῖς τοῖς πάθεσιν ἀνδρείως ἐπέτεινεν τὴν πρόσκαιρον φι-
λοτεκνίαν παριδεῖν. Καίπερ ἑπτὰ τέκνων ὁρῶσα ἀπώλειαν πᾶσαν,
πάσας ἡ γενναία μήτηρ ἐξεδυσεν διὰ τὴν πρὸς Θεὸν πίστιν. Κα-
θάπερ γὰρ ἐν βουλευτηρίῳ τῇ ἑαυτῆς ψυχῇ δεινοὺς ὁρῶσα συμ-
βούλους, φύσιν καὶ γένεσιν καὶ φιλοτεκνίαν καὶ τέκνων στρέβλας
δυσώπους μήτης, θανατηφόρον τε καὶ σωτήριον ὑπὲρ
τέκνων οὐκ ἐπέγνω τὴν σώζουσαν ἑπτὰ υἱοὺς πρὸς ὀλίγον χρό-
νου σωτηρίαν· ἀλλὰ τῆς θεοσεβοῦς Ἀβραὰμ καρτερίας ἡ θυγά-
τηρ ἐμνήσθη. Ὦ μήτηρ ἔθνους, ἔκδικε τοῦ νόμου, καὶ ὑπερα-
σπίστρια τῆς εὐσεβείας, καὶ τοῦ διὰ σπλάγχνων ἀγῶνος ἀθλο-
φόρε. Ὦ ἀρρένων πρὸς καρτερίαν γενναιοτέρα, καὶ ἀνδρῶν πρὸς
ὑπομονὴν ἀνδρειοτέρα. Καθάπερ γὰρ ἡ Νῶε κιβωτὸς ἐν τῷ κο-
σμοπληθεῖ κατακλυσμῷ κοσμοφοροῦσα καρτερῶς ὑπήνεγκεν τοὺς
κλύδωνας. Οὕτως σύ , ἡ νομοφύλαξ, πανταχόθεν ἐν τῷ τῶν
παθῶν περιαντλουμένη κατακλυσμῷ, καὶ καρτεροῖς ἀνέμοις ταῖς
τῶν υἱῶν βασάνοις συνεχομένη , γενναίως ὑπέμεινας τοὺς ὑπὲρ
τῆς εὐσεβείας χειμῶνας.

**CHAPTER XVI.**

Εἰ δὲ τοίνυν καὶ γυνή, καὶ γηραιά, καὶ ἑπτὰ παίδων μήτηρ
ὑπέμεινε τὰς μέχρι θανάτου βασάνους ὁρῶσα τῶν τέκνων· ὁμο-

who didst bring [them] forth to term.
**18** The firstborn, yielding up his spirit, did not turn thee; nor the second, looking upon thee with pity amidst his torments;
**19** nor yet the third, giving up the ghost. Neither didst thou, beholding the eyes of each one raging like a bull amidst the tortures, working their own torment,
**20** and their nostrils portending their death, didst thou not weep. Beholding, upon the flesh of thy children, their flesh consumed by fire, and from their hands, their hands being severed, and from their heads, their heads being hewn off, and the dead falling upon the dead; yea, seeing the sepulcher of thy children's dance amidst the torments, thou didst not shed a tear.
**21** Not in like wise do the Siren's melodies, nor the swan's songs unto [those with] a love of hearing, draw near their listeners, as do the voices of children crying out to their mother amidst their torments.
**22** With how great and how many torments then was the mother tormented, whilst her sons were tortured by wheels and by goads?
**23** But her pious Reason did courageously strengthen her inward parts amidst those very sufferings, that she might disregard the temporary love of [her] children.
**24** And although beholding the utter destruction of seven children, yet the noble mother did strip off all [her natural affections] through her faith toward God.
**25** For as a mother, beholding within her own soul, as in a council chamber, terrible counsellors—even Nature, and Birth, and the love of children, and the painful torments of her children—[all these did she deem] importunate;
**26** nor did she discern as saving for her children the temporary salvation which would preserve seven sons for a brief space of time;
**28** but the daughter of the God-fearing Abraham did remember his endurance.
**29** O mother of a nation, thou avenger of the Law, and defender of piety, and champion of the struggle waged within the inward parts!
**30** O thou more noble than males in enduring, and more valiant than men in steadfastness!
**31** For even as the Ark of Noah, bearing the world's fullness amidst the world-engulfing deluge, did bravely endure the raging billows;
**32** so also didst thou, O guardian of the Law, being deluged on every side by the flood of passions, and hemmed in by the strong winds of thy sons' torments, bravely endure the storms [sent] for piety's sake.

**CHAPTER XVI.**

**1** If therefore even a woman, and [she] an old one, and a mother of seven children, did endure the torments even unto death, beholding her children;
