**ΣΟΦΙΑ ΚΕΦ. Θʹ. Ιʹ.**

**17.** Βουλὴν δέ σου τίς ἔγνω, εἰ μὴ σὺ ἔδωκας σοφίαν, καὶ ἔπεμψας
**18.** τὸ ἅγιόν σου πνεῦμα ἀπὸ ὑψίστων; Καὶ οὕτως διωρθώθησαν αἱ
**19.** τρίβοι τῶν ἐπὶ γῆς, καὶ τὰ ἀρεστά σου ἐδιδάχθησαν ἄνθρωποι,
καὶ τῇ σοφίᾳ ἐσώθησαν.

**ΚΕΦ. Ιʹ. Χ.**

**1.** Αὕτη πρωτόπλαστον πατέρα κόσμου μόνον κτισθέντα διε-
**2.** φύλαξε, καὶ ἐξείλατο αὐτὸν ἐκ παραπτώματος ἰδίου· ἔδωκέ τε
**3.** αὐτῷ ἰσχὺν κρατῆσαι πάντων. Ἀποστὰς δὲ ἀπ᾽ αὐτῆς ἄδικος
**4.** ἐν ὀργῇ αὐτοῦ, ἀδελφοκτόνοις συναπώλετο θυμοῖς· δι᾽ ὃν κατα-
κλυζομένην γῆν πάλιν ἔσωσε σοφία. δι᾽ εὐτελοῦς ξύλου τὸν δί-
**5.** καιον κυβερνήσασα. Αὕτη καὶ ἐν ὁμονοίᾳ πονηρίας ἐθνῶν συγ-
χυθέντων, ἔγνω τὸν δίκαιον, καὶ ἐτήρησεν αὐτὸν ἄμεμπτον Θεῷ,
**6.** καὶ ἐπὶ τέκνου σπλάγχνοις ἰσχυρὸν ἐφύλαξεν. Αὕτη δίκαιον, ἐ-
ξαπολλυμένων ἀσεβῶν, ἐῤῥύσατο φυγόντα καταβάσιον πῦρ Πεν-
**7.** ταπόλεως· ἧς ἔτι μαρτύριον τῆς πονηρίας καπνιζομένη καθέση-
κε χέρσες, καὶ ἀτελέσιν ὥραις καρπεσφοροῦντα φυτά, καὶ ἀπιστού-
**8.** σης ψυχῆς μνημεῖον ἐσκυῖα στήλη ἁλός. Σοφίαν γὰρ παροδεύσαν-
τες οὐ μόνον ἐβλάβησαν τοῦ μὴ γνῶναι τὰ καλά, ἀλλὰ καὶ τῆς
**9.** ἑαυτῶν ἀφροσύνης ἀπέλιπον τῷ βίῳ μνημόσυνον, ἵνα ἐν οἷς ἐ-
σφάλησαν, μηδὲ λαθεῖν δυνηθῶσι. Σοφία δὲ τοὺς θεραπεύοντας
**10.** αὐτὴν ἐκ πόνων ἐῤῥύσατο. Αὕτη φυγάδα ὀργῆς ἀδελφοῦ δίκαιον
ὡδήγησεν ἐν τρίβοις εὐθείαις, ἔδειξεν αὐτῷ βασιλείαν Θεοῦ, καὶ
ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ γνῶσιν ἁγίων· ηὐπόρησεν αὐτὸν ἐν μόχθοις, καὶ ἐπλή-
**11.** θυνε τοὺς πόνους αὐτοῦ· ἐν πλεονεξίᾳ κατισχυόντων αὐτὸν πα-
**12.** ρέστη καὶ ἐπλούτισεν αὐτόν· δι εφύλαξεν αὐτὸν ἀπὸ ἐχθρῶν, καὶ
ἀπὸ ἐνεδρευόντων ἠσφαλίσατο, καὶ ἀγῶνα ἰσχυρὸν ἐβράβευσεν αὐ-
**13.** τῷ, ἵνα γνῷ, ὅτι παντὸς δυνατωτέρα ἐστὶν ἡ εὐσέβεια. Αὕτη
πραθέντα δίκαιον οὐκ ἐγκατέλειπεν, ἀλλὰ ἐξ ἁμαρτίας ἐῤῥύσατο
**14.** αὐτόν· συγκατέβη αὐτῷ εἰς λάκκον, καὶ ἐν δεσμοῖς οὐκ ἀφῆκεν
αὐτόν, ἕως ἤνεγκεν αὐτῷ σκῆπτρα βασιλείας καὶ ἐξουσίαν τυ-
**15.** ραννούντων αὐτοῦ· ψευδεῖς τε ἔδειξεν τοὺς μωμησαμένους αὐ-
τὸν, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ δόξαν αἰώνιον. Αὕτη λαὸν ὅσιον καὶ σπέρ-
**16.** μα ἄμεμπτον ἐῤῥύσατο ἐξ ἔθνους θλιβόντων· εἰσῆλθεν εἰς ψυχὴν
Θεράποντος Κυρίου, καὶ ἀντέστη βασιλεῦσι φοβεροῖς ἐν τέρασι.

**CHAPTER IX.** (continued)

**17** But who shall know Thy counsel,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;save Thou gavest wisdom,
**18** And didst send Thy Holy Spirit from on high?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus were made straight the paths upon the earth,
**19** And men were taught the things well-pleasing unto Thee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and through Wisdom were they saved.

**CHAPTER X.**

**1** SHE did guard the first-formed father of the world,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;being created alone,
**2** And did deliver him from his own transgression;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and gave unto him strength to hold dominion over all [things].
**3** But the unrighteous man, having departed from her,
**4** In his wrath, perished together with fratricidal angers;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for whose sake, when the earth was being deluged,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wisdom again saved [it],
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;having guided the righteous man by means of a humble wood.
**5** She also, when nations were confounded in their agreement of wickedness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;did know the righteous man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and did keep him blameless before God,
**6** And kept him strong regarding [his] love for his child.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She rescued the righteous man,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when the ungodly were perishing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who fled the descending fire of the Pentapolis;
**7** Of which [land], even now, a smoking desolation doth stand as a witness to [their] wickedness,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and plants bearing fruit in untimely seasons,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a fashioned pillar of salt, [a] monument of an unbelieving soul.
**8** For those who disregarded Wisdom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not only were harmed in that they knew not the good things,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but also left behind a memorial of their own foolishness unto [all] life,
**9** So that in that wherein they stumbled,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they might not even be able to be hidden.
**10** But Wisdom delivered them that served her from their labors.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She guided the righteous man, a fugitive from his brother’s wrath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in straight paths,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;showed him the Kingdom of God,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and gave him knowledge of holy things;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she prospered him in his toils,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and made abundant his labors;
**11** When covetous ones prevailed against him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she stood by [him] and enriched him;
**12** She preserved him from his enemies,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and secured him from those who lay in wait,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and granted unto him a mighty contest,
**13** That he might know that godliness is more powerful than all [things].
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not forsake the righteous man when he was sold,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but rescued him from sin;
**14** She went down with him into the pit,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and in bonds she did not abandon him,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until she brought him scepters of kingship
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and power over those who tyrannized him;
**15** And showed those who slandered him to be false,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and gave unto him everlasting glory.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She rescued a holy people and a blameless seed
**16** From a nation that oppressed them;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she entered into the soul of a Servant of the Lord,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and withstood fearful kings with wonders.
