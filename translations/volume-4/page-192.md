    κατεσεμμένοι μετ᾽ εὐφροσύνης καὶ βοῆς, ἐν αἴνοις καὶ παμμελέσιν ὕμνοις εὐχαριστοῦντες τῷ Θεῷ τῶν πατέρων αὑτῶν αἰωνίῳ σωτῆρι τοῦ Ἰσραήλ.
    **17** Παραγενηθέντες δὲ εἰς Πτολεμαΐδα τὴν ὀνομαζομένην διὰ τὴν τοῦ τόπου ἰδιότητα βδρόφρον, ἐν ᾗ προσέμεινεν αὐτοὺς ὁ στόλος κατὰ κοινὴν αὐτῶν βουλὴν ἡμέρας ἑπτά,
    **18** ἐκεῖ ἐποίησαν πότον σωτηρίου, τοῦ βασιλέως χορηγήσαντος αὑτοῖς εὐψύχως τὰ πρὸς τὴν ἄφιξιν πάντα ἑκάστῳ ἕως εἰς τὴν ἰδίαν οἰκίαν.
    **19** Καταχθέντες δὲ μετ᾽ εἰρήνης ἐν ταῖς πρεπούσαις ἐξομολογήσεσιν, ὡσαύτως κἀκεῖ ἔστησαν καὶ ταύτας ἄγειν τὰς ἡμέρας ἐπὶ τὸν τῆς παροικίας αὑτῶν χρόνον εὐφροσύνους.
    **20** Ἃς καὶ ἀνιερώσαντες ἐν στήλῃ κατὰ τὸν τῆς συμποσίας τόπον προσευχῆς καθιδρύσαντες, ἀνέλυσαν ἀσινῶς, ἐλεύθεροι, ὑπερχαρεῖς, διά τε γῆς καὶ θαλάσσης καὶ ποταμοῦ ἀνασωζόμενοι τῇ τοῦ βασιλέως ἐπιταγῇ, ἕκαστος εἰς τὴν ἰδίαν,
    **21** καὶ πλείστην ἢ ἔμπροσθεν ἐν τοῖς ἐχθροῖς ἐξουσίαν ἐσχηκότες μετὰ δόξης καὶ φόβου, τὸ σύνολον ὑπὸ μηδενὸς διασεισθέντες τῶν ὑπαρχόντων.
    **22** Καὶ πάντα τὰ ἐχόντων πάντες ἐκομίσαντο ἐξ ἀπογραφῆς, ὥστε τοὺς ἔχοντάς τι, μετὰ φόβου μεγίστου ἀποδοῦναι αὑτοῖς, τὰ μεγαλεῖα τοῦ μεγάλου Θεοῦ ποιήσαντος τελείως ἐπὶ σωτηρίᾳ αὑτῶν.
    **23** Εὐλογητὸς ὁ ῥύστης Ἰσραὴλ εἰς τοὺς ἀεὶ χρόνους. Ἀμήν.

    adorned with joy and with shouting, in praises and all-harmonious hymns giving thanks to the God of their fathers, the eternal Savior of Israel.

    **17** And when they had arrived at Ptolemais, which by reason of the peculiarity of the place was called Bdrophron, where the fleet awaited them for seven days according to their common counsel,
    **18** there they held a feast of salvation, the king having cheerfully supplied unto each of them all things for their journey, even unto his own house.
    **19** And having been brought down in peace with fitting thanksgivings, likewise did they there establish that these days should be kept joyfully for the time of their sojourning.
    **20** And these days, having consecrated them upon a pillar in the place of their feasting, and having established a [place of] prayer, they departed safely, free, and exceedingly joyful, being preserved through both land and sea and river by the king's command, each unto his own [home];
    **21** and having obtained more authority than before among their enemies, with glory and with [inspiring] fear, nor were any of their possessions at all disturbed by any man.
    **22** And all things which they possessed did all receive back by inventory, so that those who had anything [of theirs] did, with exceeding great fear, restore it unto them, the great God having perfectly performed great deeds for their salvation.
    **23** Blessed be the Deliverer of Israel for evermore. Amen.
