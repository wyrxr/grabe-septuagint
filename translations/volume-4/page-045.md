**4** τες ὑμεῖς, καὶ πάντες οἱ κατοικοῦντες πᾶν ὅριον Ἰσραήλ, κατα-
**5** στρώσετε αὐτοὺς ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὐτῶν. Πρὸ δὲ τοῦ ποιῆσαι ταῦ-
τα, καλέσατέ μοι Ἀχιὼρ τὸν Ἀμμανίτην, ἵνα ἰδὼν ἐπιγνῷ τὸν
ἐκφαυλίσαντα τὸν οἶκον Ἰσραήλ, καὶ αὐτὸν ὡς εἰς θάνατον ἀ-
**6** ποστείλαντα εἰς ἡμᾶς. Καὶ ἐκάλεσαν τὸν Ἀχιὼρ ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου
Ὀζία. ὡς δὲ ἦλθε, καὶ εἶδε τὴν κεφαλὴν Ὁλοφέρνου ἐν χειρὶ
ἀνδρὸς ἑνὸς ἐν τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ τοῦ λαοῦ, ἔπεσεν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον, καὶ
**7** ἐξελύθη τὸ πνεῦμα αὐτοῦ. Ὡς δὲ ἀνέλαβον αὐτόν, προσέπεσε
τοῖς ποσὶν Ἰουδίθ, καὶ προσεκύνησε τῷ προσώπῳ αὐτῆς, καὶ εἶ-
πεν· εὐλογημένη σὺ ἐν παντὶ σκηνώματι Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐν παντὶ
**8** ἔθνει, οἵτινες ἀκούσαντες τὸ ὄνομά σου ταραχθήσονται. Καὶ νῦν
ἀνάγγειλόν μοι ὅσα ἐποίησας ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ταύταις. καὶ ἀπήγ-
γειλεν αὐτῷ Ἰουδὶθ ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ λαοῦ πάντα ὅσα ἦν πεποιη-
**9** κυῖα, ἀφ᾽ ἧς ἡμέρας ἐξῆλθεν ἕως οὗ ἐλάλει αὐτοῖς. Ὡς δὲ ἐπαύ-
σατο λαλοῦσα, ἠλάλαξεν ὁ λαὸς φωνῇ μεγάλη, καὶ ἔδωκε φω-
**10** νὴν εὐφροσύνης ἐν τῇ πόλει αὐτῶν. Ἰδὼν δὲ Ἀχιὼρ πάντα ὅσα
ἐποίησεν ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, ἐπίστευσε τῷ Θεῷ σφόδρα, καὶ
περιετέμετο τὴν σάρκα τῆς ἀκροβυστίας αὐτοῦ, καὶ προσετέθη
**11** πρὸς τὸν οἶκον Ἰσραὴλ ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης. Ἡνίκα δὲ ὁ ὄρ-
θρος ἀνέβη, ἐκρέμασαν τὴν κεφαλὴν Ὁλοφέρνου ἐκ τοῦ τείχους·
καὶ ἀνέλαβε πᾶς ἀνὴρ τὰ ὅπλα αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐξῆλθοσαν κατὰ στεί-
**12** ρην ἐπὶ τὰς ἀναβάσεις τοῦ ὄρους. Οἱ δὲ υἱοὶ Ἀσσούρ, ὡς εἶδον
αὐτούς, διέπεμψαν ἐπὶ τοὺς ἡγουμένους αὐτῶν· οἱ δὲ ἦλθον ἐπὶ
τοὺς στρατηγοὺς καὶ χιλιάρχους καὶ ἐπὶ πάντα ἄρχοντα αὐτῶν,
**13** καὶ παρεγένοντο ἐπὶ τὴν σκηνὴν Ὁλοφέρνου, καὶ εἶπαν τῷ ὄντι
ἐπὶ πάντων τῶν αὐτοῦ· ἔγειρον δὴ τὸν κύριον ἡμῶν, ὅτι ἐτόλ-
μησαν οἱ δοῦλοι καταβαίνειν ἐφ᾽ ἡμᾶς εἰς πόλεμον, ἵνα ἐξολε-
**14** θρευθῶσιν εἰς τέλος. Καὶ εἰσῆλθε Βαγώας, καὶ ἔκρουσε τὴν αὖ-
**15** λὴν τῆς σκηνῆς, ὑπενόει γὰρ καθεύδειν αὐτὸν μετὰ Ἰουδίθ. Ὡς
δὲ οὐδεὶς ὑπήκουσε, διαστείλας εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸν κοιτῶνα, καὶ
εὗρεν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τῆς χελωνίδος ἐῤῥιμμένον νεκρόν, καὶ ἡ κεφαλὴ
**16** αὐτοῦ ἀφήρητο ἀπ᾽ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐβόησε φωνῇ μεγάλῃ μετὰ κλαυθ-
μοῦ καὶ στεναγμοῦ καὶ βοῆς ἰσχυρᾶς, καὶ διέῤῥηξε τὰ ἱμάτια
**17** αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὴν σκηνὴν οὗ ἦν Ἰουδὶθ καταλύουσα,
καὶ οὐχ εὗρεν αὐτήν, καὶ ἐξεπήδησεν εἰς τὸν λαόν, καὶ ἐβόησεν·
**18** ἠθέτησαν οἱ δοῦλοι, ἐποίησαν αἰσχύνην μία γυνὴ τῶν Ἑβραίων

#### CHAPTER 14

**4** And ye, following after, and all they that inhabit every border of Israel, shall utterly overthrow them in their ways.
**5** But ere ye do these things, call ye for me Achior the Ammonite, that he, when he seeth, may know him who brought contempt upon the house of Israel, and him who sent him unto us as unto death.”
**6** And they called Achior from the house of Uzziah. And when he came, and beheld the head of Holofernes in the hand of a man in the assembly of the people, he fell upon his face, and his spirit failed him.
**7** And when they had raised him up, he fell at the feet of Judith, and did obeisance unto her, and said, “Blessed art thou in every tabernacle of Judah, and in every nation; for all they who hear thy name shall be greatly troubled.”
**8** “And now declare unto me all that thou hast done in these days.” And Judith declared unto him in the midst of the people all that she had wrought, from the day she went forth until that time she spake unto them.
**9** And when she had ceased to speak, the people gave a great shout, and raised a cry of gladness within their city.
**10** And when Achior had seen all that the God of Israel had done, he believed in God with exceeding great faith, and circumcised the flesh of his foreskin, and was joined unto the house of Israel unto this day.
**11** And when the morning rose, they hanged the head of Holofernes from the wall; and every man took up his weapons, and they went forth in their array upon the ascents of the mountain.
**12** And when the sons of Assyria beheld them, they sent word unto their leaders; and these came unto the generals and the captains over thousands and unto every one of their rulers,
**13** and they drew near unto the tent of Holofernes, and said unto him who was in charge of all his [possessions]: “Awake now our lord; for the servants have dared to come down against us to war, that they may be utterly destroyed unto the end.”
**14** And Bagoas entered in, and knocked at the entrance of the tent,
**15** for he supposed that he slept with Judith. But when no man answered, he, having drawn aside [the curtain], entered into the bedchamber, and found him cast forth dead upon the couch, and his head had been taken from him.
**16** And he cried out with a great voice, with weeping and with groaning and with a mighty cry, and rent his garments.
**17** And he entered into the tent where Judith had been lodging, and found her not; and he sprang forth unto the people, and cried out, saying:
**18** “The servants have dealt treacherously! A single woman of the Hebrews hath brought great shame upon the house of King Nebuchadnezzar, for behold, Holofernes lieth upon the ground, and his head is not upon him.”
