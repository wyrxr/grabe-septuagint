κατεδουλώσαντο αὐτοὺς ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης. Καὶ τὰς ἐπιλοίπους βασιλείας καὶ τὰς νήσους, ὅσοι ποτὲ ἀντέστησαν αὐτοῖς, κατέφθειραν καὶ ἐδούλωσαν αὐτούς. Μετὰ δὲ τῶν φίλων αὐτῶν 12
καὶ τῶν ἐπανακαμψουμένων αὐτοῖς συνεπήγησαν αὐτοῖς φιλίαν, καὶ κατεκράτησαν τῶν βασιλειῶν τῶν ἐγγὺς καὶ τῶν μακράν, καὶ ὅσοι ἤκουσαν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτῶν ἐφοβοῦντο ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν. Οἷς δ᾿ ἂν 13
βούλωνται βοηθεῖν καὶ βασιλεύειν, βασιλεύουσιν· οὓς δ᾿ ἂν βούλωνται, μεθιστῶσι· καὶ ὑψώθησαν σφόδρα. Καὶ ἐν ἅπασι τούτοις οὐκ ἐπέθεντο οὐδεὶς αὐτῶν διάδημα, καὶ οὐ περιεβάλοντο 14
πορφύραν, ὥστε ἀδρυνθῆναι ἐν αὐτῇ. Καὶ βουλευτήριον ἐποίησαν 15
ἑαυτοῖς, καὶ καθ᾿ ἡμέραν ἐβουλεύοντο τριακόσιοι καὶ εἴκοσι βουλευόμενοι διαπαντὸς περὶ τοῦ πλήθους, τοῦ εὐκοσμεῖν ἑαυτοὺς.
Καὶ πιστεύουσιν ἑνὶ ἀνθρώπῳ ἄρχειν αὐτῶν κατ᾿ ἐνιαυτόν, καὶ 16
κυριεύειν πάσης τῆς γῆς αὐτῶν, καὶ πάντες ἀκούουσι τοῦ ἑνός, καὶ οὐκ ἔστι φθόνος οὔτε ζῆλος ἐν αὐτοῖς. Καὶ ἐπέλεξεν Ἰούδας 17
τὸν Εὐπόλεμον υἱὸν Ἰωάννου τοῦ Ἀκκὼς καὶ Ἰάσονα υἱὸν Ἐλεαζάρου, καὶ ἀπέστειλεν αὐτοὺς εἰς Ῥώμην, στῆσαι αὐτοῖς
φιλίαν καὶ συμμαχίαν, καὶ τοῦ ἆραι τὸν ζυγὸν ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν, ἔτι 18
ἰδὼν τὴν βασιλείαν τῶν Ἑλλήνων καταδουλουμένους τὸν Ἰσραὴλ δουλείαν. Καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν εἰς Ῥώμην, καὶ ἡ ὁδὸς πολλὴ σφόδρα, 19
καὶ εἰσῆλθον εἰς τὸ βουλευτήριον, καὶ ἀπεκρίθησαν καὶ εἶπον·
Ἰούδας ὁ καὶ Μακκαβαῖος καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ τὸ πλῆθος 20
τῶν Ἰουδαίων ἀπέστειλαν ἡμᾶς πρὸς ὑμᾶς, στῆσαι μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν συμμαχίαν καὶ εἰρήνην, καὶ γραφῆναι ἡμᾶς συμμάχους καὶ φίλους ὑμῶν. Καὶ ἤρεσεν ὁ λόγος ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν. Καὶ τοῦτο 21. 22
τὸ ἀντίγραφον τῆς ἐπιστολῆς, ἧς ἀντέγραψαν ἐπὶ δέλτοις χαλκαῖς· καὶ ἀπέστειλαν εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ εἶναι παρ᾿ αὐτοῖς ἐκεῖ μνημόσυνον εἰρήνης καὶ συμμαχίας. Καλῶς γένοιτο Ῥωμαίοις καὶ 23
τῷ ἔθνει τῶν Ἰουδαίων ἐν τῇ θαλάσσῃ καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς ξηρᾶς εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, καὶ ῥομφαία καὶ ἐχθρὸς μακρυνθείη ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν.
Ἐὰν δὲ ἐνστῇ πόλεμος ἐν Ῥώμῃ προτέρα ἢ πᾶσι τοῖς συμμάχοις 24
αὐτῶν ἐν πάσῃ κυρίᾳ αὐτῶν· Συμμαχήσει τὸ ἔθνος τῶν Ἰουδαίων, 25
ὡς ἂν ὁ καιρὸς ὑπογραφῇ αὐτοῖς καρδίᾳ πλήρει. Καὶ τοῖς 26
πολεμοῦσιν οὐ δώσουσιν οὐδὲ ἐπαρκέσουσι σῖτον, ὅπλα, ἀργύριον, πλοῖα, ὡς ἔδοξε Ῥώμῃ· καὶ φυλάξονται τὰ φυλάγματα αὐτῶν οὐθὲν λαβόντες. Κατὰ τὰ αὐτὰ δὲ, ἐὰν ἔθνει Ἰουδαίων 27

**Chapter 8**

**11** and had enslaved them even unto this day. And the remaining kingdoms and the islands, as many as ever resisted them, they utterly destroyed and enslaved.
**12** But with their friends, and with those who would come over unto them, they established friendship; and they subdued the kingdoms both near and far, and as many as heard their name feared them.
**13** Unto whomsoever they would grant aid, and whomsoever they would allow to reign, those [men] did reign; and whomsoever they would, they deposed; and thus were they greatly exalted.
**14** And in all these things, none among them did put on a diadem, neither did they array themselves in purple, that they might be glorified thereby.
**15** And they established a senate for themselves, and daily three hundred and twenty senators did deliberate continually concerning the multitude, [that they might] order themselves aright.
**16** And they entrust one man to rule over them for a year, and to hold dominion over all their land; and all men hearken unto that one, and there is neither envy nor rivalry among them.
**17** And Judas chose Eupolemus, the son of John of Accos, and Jason, the son of Eleazar, and sent them unto Rome, to establish for them
**18** friendship and an alliance, and to remove the yoke from them; for he had yet beheld the kingdom of the Greeks bringing Israel into bondage and servitude.
**19** And they journeyed unto Rome, and the way was exceeding long; and they entered into the senate, and they answered and said:
**20** “Judas, who is also Maccabeus, and his brethren, and the multitude of the Jews, have sent us unto you, to establish with you an alliance and peace, and that we might be inscribed as your allies and friends.”
**21** And the word was pleasing in their sight.
**22** And this is the copy of the letter which they inscribed upon tablets of bronze, and sent unto Jerusalem, that it might be there among them as a memorial of peace and alliance.
**23** “May it be well for the Romans and for the nation of the Jews, both on the sea and on the land, forevermore; and may the sword and the enemy be far removed from them.
**24** Now if war should arise against Rome first, or against any of their allies in all their dominion:
**25** then shall the nation of the Jews fight alongside them, as the occasion shall be prescribed unto them, with a full heart.
**26** And unto their enemies shall they neither give nor supply grain, weapons, silver, nor ships, as it has seemed good unto Rome. And they shall guard their own garrisons, receiving naught [from the Romans for their upkeep or for their military service].
**27** And in like manner, if war should befall the nation of the Jews first,”
