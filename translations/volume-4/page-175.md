1   Ὁ δὲ Φιλοπάτωρ παρὰ τῶν ἀνακομισθέντων μαθὼν τὴν
    γεινομένην τῶν ὑπ᾿ αὐτοῦ κρατουμένων τόπων ἀφαίρεσιν ὑπὸ Ἀν-
    τιόχου, παραγγείλας ταῖς πάσαις δυνάμεσι πεζικαῖς καὶ ἱππικαῖς
    αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὴν ἀδελφὴν Ἀρσινόην συμπαραλαβών, ἐξώρμησε μέ-
    χρι τῶν κατὰ Ῥαφίαν τόπων, ὅπου παρεμβεβλήκεισαν οἱ περὶ
2   Ἀντίοχον. Θεόδοτος δέ τις ἐκπληρῶσαι τὴν ἐπιβουλὴν διανοη-
    θείς, παραλαβὼν τῶν προϋποπεταγμένων αὐτῷ ὅπλων Πτολεμαι-
    κῶν τὰ κράτιστα, διεκκομίσθη νύκτωρ ἐπὶ τὴν τοῦ Πτολεμαίου
    σκηνήν, ὡς μόνος κτείναι αὐτόν, καὶ ἐν τούτῳ διαλῦσαι τὸν πό-
3   λεμον. Τοῦτον δὲ διάγων Δωσίθεος ὁ Δριμύλου λεγόμενος, τὸ
    γένος Ἰουδαῖος, ὕστερον δὲ μεταβαλὼν τὰ νόμιμα, καὶ τῶν πα-
    τρίων δογμάτων ἀπηλλοτριωμένος, ἀσημόν τινα κατέκλινεν ἐν τῇ
4   σκηνῇ, ὃν συνέβη κομίσασθαι τὴν ἐκείνου κόλασιν. Γενομένης δὲ
    καρτερᾶς μάχης, καὶ τῶν πραγμάτων μᾶλλον ἐξωρουμένων τῷ Ἀν-
    τιόχῳ, ἱκανῶς ἡ Ἀρσινόη ἐπιπορευσαμένη τὰς δυνάμεις παρε-
    κάλει , μετὰ οἴκτου καὶ δακρύων τοὺς πλοκάμους λελυμένη, βοη-
    θεῖν ἑαυτοῖς τε καὶ τοῖς τέκνοις καὶ ταῖς γυναιξὶ θαῤῥαλέως,
5   ἐπαγγελλομένη δώσειν νικήσασιν ἑκάστῳ δύο μνᾶς χρυσίου. Καὶ
    τ᾽ οὕτως συνέβη τοὺς ἀντιπάλους ἐν χειρονομίαις διαφθαρῆναι,
6   πολλοὺς δὲ καὶ δοραιαλώτους συλληφθῆναι. Κατακρατήσας δὲ
    τῆς ἐπιβουλῆς ἔκρινε τὰς πλησίον πόλεις ἐπελθὼν παρακαλέσαι.
7   Ποιήσας δὲ τοῦτο, καὶ τοῖς τεμένεσι δωρεὰς ἀπονείμας, εὐθαρ-
8   σεῖς τοὺς ὑποτεταγμένους κατέστησε. Τῶν δὲ Ἰουδαίων δια-
    πεμψαμένων πρὸς αὐτὸν ἀπὸ τῆς γερουσίας, καὶ τῶν πρεσβυτέ-
    ρων τοὺς ἀσπαζομένους αὐτόν, καὶ ξένια κομίζοντας , καὶ ἐπὶ

**The Third Book of Maccabees**

**Chapter 1**

**1** Now Philopator, having learned from those brought unto him of the seizure by Antiochus of the territories which he himself did hold, commanded all his forces, both infantry and cavalry; and taking along his sister Arsinoe, he marched forth as far as the region of Raphia, where Antiochus and his host had encamped.

**2** But a certain Theodotus, having purposed to carry out his treacherous plot, did take the best of the Ptolemaic weapons formerly entrusted unto him, and went stealthily by night unto the tent of Ptolemy, that he might slay him alone, and thereby bring an end to the war.

**3** Now Dositheus, who was called [the son] of Drimylus, a Jew by birth (yet afterward did he change his customs and become estranged from the ancestral doctrines), had laid a man of no renown in the tent; whom it did befall to receive the punishment intended for him.

**4** Now when a fierce battle had begun, and matters did turn more to Antiochus' advantage, Arsinoe, having moved amongst the ranks, did earnestly exhort the forces, with piteous lamentation and with tears, her locks unloosed, that they should courageously help both themselves, their children, and their wives,

**5** promising to give unto each of them that conquered two minae of gold. And thus it came to pass that the adversaries did perish in hand-to-hand conflict,

**6** and many also were taken captive by the spear. But Ptolemy, having overcome the conspiracy [against his life], did deem it right to visit the nearby cities and exhort them.

**7** And having done this, and having bestowed gifts upon the temples, he did establish his subjects in good courage.

**8** Now when the Jews, from the Gerousia and the elders, had sent unto him messengers to salute him and bearing gifts, and upon
