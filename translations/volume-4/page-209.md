**ΜΑΚΚΑΒΑΙΩΝ Δ´. ΚΕΦ. Ι´.**

**21** Σὲ δὲ ταχέως μετελεύσεται ὁ Θεός· τὴν γὰρ τῶν θείων ὕμνων
μελῳδῶν γλῶτταν ἐκτέμνεις.

**ΚΕΦ. ΙΑ´. ΧΙ.**

**1** Ὡς δὲ καὶ οὗτος ταῖς βασάνοις κατακισθεὶς ἐναπέθανεν, ὁ
**2** πέμπτος παρεπήδησε, λέγων· Οὐ μέλλω, τύραννε, πρὸς τὸν ὑπὲρ
**3** τῆς ἀρετῆς βασανισμὸν παραιτεῖσθαι. Αὐτὸς δ᾽ ἀπ᾽ ἐμαυτοῦ πα-
**4** ρῆλθον, ὅπως κἀμὲ κατακτείνας, περὶ πλειόνων ἀδικημάτων ὀφεί-
**5** λῃς τῇ οὐρανίῳ δίκῃ τιμωρίαν. Ὦ μισάρετε καὶ μισάνθρωπε,
**6** τί δράσαντας ἡμᾶς τοῦτον πορθεῖς τὸν τρόπον; Ἢ κακόν σοι δο-
**7** κεῖ, ὅτι τὸν πάντων κτιστὴν εὐσεβοῦμεν καὶ κατὰ τὸν ἐνάρετον
**8** αὐτοῦ ζῶμεν νόμον; Ἀλλὰ ταῦτα τιμῶν, οὐ βασάνων ἐστὶν
**9** ἄξια. Εἶπερ ἠσθάνου ἀνθρώπου πόθων, καὶ ἐλπίδα εἶχες παρὰ
**10** Θεῷ σωτηρίου· νῦν ἰδὲ ἀλλότριος ὢν Θεοῦ, πολεμεῖς τοὺς εὐ-
**11** σεβοῦντας εἰς τὸν Θεόν. Τοιαῦτα λέγοντα οἱ δορυφόροι δήσαντες
**12** αὐτὸν εἵλκον ἐπὶ τὸν καταπέλτην· ἐφ᾽ ᾧ δήσαντες αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὰ
**13** γόνατα, καὶ ταῦτα ποδάγραις σιδηραῖς ἐφαρμόσαντες τὴν ὀσφῦν
**14** αὐτοῦ περὶ τροχαῖον σφῆνα κατέκαμψαν· περὶ ὃν ἔλος περὶ τὸν
**15** τροχὸν σκορπίου τρόπον ἀνακλώμενος ἐξεμελίζετο. Κατὰ τοῦτον
**16** τὸν τρόπον καὶ τὸ πνεῦμα στενοχωρούμενος, καὶ τὸ σῶμα ἀγχό-
**17** μενος. Καλῶς, ἔλεγεν, ἄκων, ὦ τύραννε, χάριτας ἡμῖν χαρίζῃ
**18** διὰ γενναιοτέρων πόνων ἐπιδείξασθαι παρέχων τὴν εἰς τὸν νόμον
**19** ἡμῶν καρτερίαν. Τελευτήσαντος δὲ καὶ τούτου, ὁ ἕκτος ἤγετο
**20** μειρακίσκος· οὗ πυθανισμένου τοῦ τυράννου εἰ βούλοιτο φαγὼν
**21** ἀπολύεσθαι, ὁ δὲ ἔφη· Ἐγὼ τῇ μὲν ἡλικίᾳ τῶν ἀδελφῶν μου
**22** εἰμὶ νεώτερος, τῇ δὲ διανοίᾳ ἡλικιώτης. Εἰς τὰ αὐτὰ γὰρ καὶ
**23** γεννηθέντες καὶ τραφέντες, ὑπὲρ τῶν αὐτῶν καὶ ἀποθνήσκειν ὀφεί-
**24** λομεν ὁμοίως. Ὥστε εἰ σοὶ δοκεῖ βασανίζειν, μὴ μικροφαγοῦντα
**25** βασάνιζε. Ταῦτα αὐτὸν εἰπόντα παρῆγον ἐπὶ τὸν τροχόν. Ἐφ᾽
**26** οὗ κατατεινόμενος ἐκμελῶς καὶ ἐσφονδυλιζόμενος ὑπεκαίετο. Καὶ
**27** ὀβελίσκους δὲ ὀξεῖς πυρώσαντες, τοῖς νώτοις προσέφερον· καὶ τὰ
**28** πλευρὰ διαπείραντες, ἀπ᾽ αὐτοῦ τὰ σπλάγχνα διέκαιον. Ὁ δὲ
**29** βασανιζόμενος, ὦ ἱεροπρεποῦς ἀγῶνος, ἔλεγεν, ἐφ᾽ ὃν διὰ τὴν
**30** εὐσέβειαν εἰς γυμνασίαν πόνων ἀδελφοὶ τοσοῦτοι κληθέντες οὐκ
**31** ἐνικήθημεν. Ἀνίκητος γάρ ἐστιν, ὦ τύραννε, ἡ εὐσεβὴς ἐπιστήμη.

**CHAPTER X.**

**21** But thee shall God swiftly pursue; for thou dost cut out the tongue
of them that sing divine hymns.

**CHAPTER XI.**

**1** And when this one also, consumed by tortures, had perished therein,
**2** the fifth did step forth, saying: "I am not minded, O tyrant,
**3** to decline the torment for the sake of virtue. Yea, I myself
**4** have come forth, that having slain me also, thou mayest owe
**5** unto heavenly justice a greater penalty for more transgressions.
O thou who hatest virtue and hatest mankind,
**6** for what deeds of ours dost thou destroy us in this wise?
**7** Is it accounted evil unto thee, that we worship the Creator of all things with piety,
**8** and live according to His virtuous law? But these things, being worthy of honor,
**9** are not worthy of torments. If thou hadst indeed felt the longings of a man,
**10** and hadst hope of salvation with God; now behold, being estranged from God,
thou makest war against them who serve God with piety."
**11** As he spake such words, the guards, having bound him,
**12** did drag him unto the rack; upon which having bound him unto
**13** his knees, and having fitted iron fetters upon them, they did bend down
**14** his loins about a wheel-like wedge; around which, as a mire about the wheel,
**15** he, being bent back and twisted like a scorpion, was dismembered.
**16** In this wise, being straitened in spirit, and choked in body,
**17** he did say: "Well, O tyrant, dost thou, though unwillingly, grant unto us favors
**18** by affording us occasion to show forth our endurance for our law
**19** through more noble agonies." And when this one also had died, the sixth was led forth,
**20** a young lad; whom when the tyrant did question if he would eat
**21** and so be released, he did say: "In age am I younger than my brethren,
**22** but in understanding I am their peer. For having been born
**23** and nourished in the same things, we ought likewise to die
**24** for the same things. Wherefore, if it pleaseth thee to torture,
**25** then torment me not as one who doth eat but sparingly."
Having said these things, they led him unto the wheel.
**26** Upon which, being stretched beyond measure and dislocated from his vertebrae, he was burnt from beneath.
**27** And having heated sharp spits, they did apply them unto his back;
**28** and having pierced through his sides, they did burn his entrails from within.
**29** But he, being tormented, did say: "O sacred contest!
**30** Unto which, by reason of piety, so many brethren were called
unto a schooling of pains, yet were we not vanquished.
**31** For unconquerable, O tyrant, is the pious understanding."
