ΚΕΦ. Ζʹ. Ηʹ.                  ΙΗΣΟΥ ΥΙΟΥ ΣΙΡΑΧ             1797
χιόνων, καὶ θυσίαν ἁγιασμοῦ καὶ ἀπαρχὴν ἁγίων. Καὶ πτωχῷ 32
ἔκτεινον τὴν χεῖρά σου, ἵνα τελειωθῇ. Χάρις δό- 33
ματος ἔναντι παντὸς ζῶντος, καὶ ἐπὶ νεκρῷ μὴ ἀποκωλύσῃς χά-
ριν. Μὴ ὑστερέῃ ἀπὸ κλαιόντων, καὶ μετὰ πενθούντων πένθησον. 34
Μὴ ὄκνει ἐπισκέπτεσθαι ἀῤῥωστον˙ ἐκ γὰρ τῶν τοιούτων ἀγαπη- 35
θήσῃ. Ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς λόγοις σου μιμνήσκου τὰ ἔσχατά σου, καὶ 36
εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα οὐχ ἁμαρτήσεις.

                            ΚΕΦ. Ηʹ. VIII.

Μὴ διαμάχου μετὰ ἀνθρώπου δυνάστου, μήποτε ἐμπέσῃς εἰς 1
τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ. Μὴ ἔριζε μετὰ ἀνθρώπου πλουσίου, μήποτε ἀν- 2
τιστῇ σου τὴν ἕλκην˙ πολλοὺς γὰρ ἀπώλεσε τὸ χρυσίον καὶ καρδίας
βασιλέων ἐξέκλινεν. Μὴ διαμάχου μετὰ ἀνθρώπου γλωσσώδους, 3
καὶ μὴ ἐπιστιβάσῃς ἐπὶ τὸ πῦρ αὐτοῦ ξύλα. Μὴ πρόσπαιζε ἀπαι- 4
δεύτῳ, ἵνα μὴ ἀτιμάζωνται οἱ πρόγονοί σου. Μὴ ὀνείδιζε ἀν- 5
θρωπον ἀποστρέφοντα ἀπὸ ἁμαρτίας˙ μνήσθητι ὅτι πάντες ἐσμὲν
ἐν ἐπιτιμίοις. Μὴ ἀτιμάσῃς ἄνδρα ἐν γήρᾳ αὐτοῦ˙ καὶ γὰρ ἐξ 6
ἡμῶν γηράσκουσι. Μὴ ἐπίχαιρε ἐπὶ νεκρῷ τῷ ἐχθροτάτῳ σου˙ 7
μνήσθητι ὅτι πάντες τελευτῶμεν. Μὴ παρίδῃς διήγημα σοφῶν, 8
καὶ ἐν ταῖς παροιμίαις αὐτῶν ἀναστρέφου˙ ὅτι παρ᾿ αὐτῶν μαθήσῃ
παιδείαν, καὶ λειτουργῆσαι μεγιστὰς ἐν εὐμαρῶς. Μὴ ἀστόχει διη- 9
γήματος γερόντων˙ καὶ γὰρ αὐτοὶ ἔμαθον παρὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐ-
τῶν˙ ὅτι παρ᾿ αὐτῶν μαθήσῃ σύνεσιν, καὶ ἐν καιρῷ χρείας δοῦναι 10
ἀπόκρισιν. Μὴ ἔκκαε ἄνθρακας ἁμαρ-
τωλῷ, μὴ ἐμπυρισθῇς ἐν
πυρὶ φλογὸς αὐτοῦ. Μὴ ἐξαναστῇς ἀπὸ προσώπου ὑβριστοῦ, ἵνα 11
μὴ ἐγκαθίσῃ ὡς ἔνεδρον τῷ στόματι σου. Μὴ δανείσῃς ἀνθρώπῳ 12
ἰσχυροτέρῳ σου, καὶ ἐὰν δανείσῃς ὡς ἀπολωλεκὼς γίνου. Μὴ ἐγ- 13
γύηση ὑπὲρ δύναμίν σου˙ καὶ ἐὰν ἐγγύηση ὡς ἀποτίσων φρόντιζε.
Μὴ δικάζου μετὰ κριτοῦ˙ κατὰ γὰρ τὴν δόξαν αὐτοῦ κρινοῦσιν 14
αὐτῷ. Μετὰ τολμηροῦ μὴ πορεύου ἐν ὁδῷ, ἵνα μὴ βαρύνωνται 15
κατὰ σοῦ˙ αὐτὸς γὰρ κατὰ τὸ θέλημα αὐτοῦ ποιήσει, καὶ τῇ ἀφρο-
σύνη αὐτοῦ συναπολῇ. Μετὰ θυμώδους μὴ ποιήσῃς μάχην, καὶ 16
μὴ διαπορεύου μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ τὴν ἔρημον˙ ὅτι ὡς οὐδὲν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς 17
αὐτοῦ αἷμα, καὶ ὅπου οὐκ ἔστι βοήθεια καταβαλεῖ σε. Μετὰ 18
μωροῦ μὴ συμβουλεύου˙ οὐ γὰρ δυνήσεται λόγον στέξαι. Ἐνώ-

**Chapter Seven**
...and the bestowal of shoulder-offerings, and a sacrifice of sanctification, and the first-fruits of holy things.
32 And unto the poor stretch forth thy hand, that it may be perfected.
33 Let the grace of thy gift be before every living man, and from the dead withhold not thy kindness.
34 Be thou not wanting unto those that weep, and with them that mourn, do thou mourn.
35 Hesitate not to visit the sick; for from such deeds shalt thou be beloved.
36 In all thy words, remember thy last things, and thou shalt not sin eternally.

**Chapter Eight**

1 Contend not with a powerful man, lest thou fall into his hands.
2 Strive not with a rich man, lest he inflict a wound upon thee; for gold hath destroyed many, and hath swayed the hearts of kings.
3 Contend not with a talkative man, and heap not wood upon his fire.
4 Jest not with an unlearned man, lest thine ancestors be dishonored.
5 Reproach not a man who turneth away from sin; remember that we all are under reproof.
6 Dishonor not a man in his old age; for even from among us do men grow old.
7 Rejoice not over thy bitterest enemy when he is dead; remember that we all must die.
8 Overlook not the discourse of the wise, and among their proverbs do thou occupy thyself; for from them shalt thou learn instruction, and to serve great men with ease.
9 Fail not to heed the discourse of elders; for they themselves also learned from their fathers.
10 For from them shalt thou learn understanding, and in time of need to give an answer. Kindle not coals for a sinner, lest thou be consumed in the fire of his flame.
11 Rise not up against the face of an insolent man, lest he lie in wait as an ambush for thy mouth.
12 Lend not unto a man stronger than thyself, and if thou lendest, be as one who hath lost [it].
13 Be not surety beyond thy power; and if thou art surety, consider it as one who must pay.
14 Contend not with a judge; for according to his glory will they give judgment for him.
15 Journey not with a reckless man, lest thou be burdened on his account; for he will act according to his own will, and by his folly shalt thou perish with him.
16 Make no quarrel with an angry man, and go not with him through the wilderness.
17 For blood is as nothing in his eyes, and where no help is, he will cast thee down.
18 Take no counsel with a fool; for he will not be able to keep a word.
