**ΚΕΦ. Θʹ. ΜΑΚΚΑΒΑΙΩΝ Αʹ. 1637**
αὐτοὺς ἡμεῖς δὲ ὀλίγοι. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰούδας· μὴ μοι γένοιτο 10
ποιῆσαι τὸ πρᾶγμα τοῦτο, φυγεῖν ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν· καὶ εἰ ἤγγικεν ὁ
καιρὸς ἡμῶν, καὶ ἀποθάνωμεν ἐν ἀνδρείᾳ χάριν τῶν ἀδελφῶν ἡ-
μῶν, καὶ μὴ καταλίπωμεν αἰτίαν τῇ δόξῃ ἡμῶν. Καὶ ἀπῆρεν ἡ 11
δύναμις ἀπὸ τῆς παρεμβολῆς, καὶ ἔστησαν εἰς συνάντησιν αὐ-
τοῖς, καὶ ἐμερίσθη ἡ ἵππος εἰς δύο μέρη, καὶ οἱ σφενδονῆται
καὶ οἱ τοξόται προεπορεύοντο τῆς δυνάμεως, καὶ οἱ πρωταγωνι-
σταὶ πάντες οἱ δυνατοί. Βακχίδης δὲ ἦν ἐν τῷ δεξιῷ κέρατι, καὶ 12
ἤγγισεν ἡ φάλαγξ ἐκ τῶν δύο μερῶν, καὶ ἐφώνουν ταῖς σάλπιγξι·
καὶ ἐσάλπισαν καὶ οἱ παρὰ Ἰούδα καὶ αὐτοὶ ταῖς σάλπιγξι· καὶ 13
ἐσείσθη ἡ γῆ ἀπὸ τῆς φωνῆς τῶν παρεμβολῶν αὐτῶν· καὶ ἐγέ-
νετο ὁ πόλεμος συνημμένος ἀπὸ πρωΐθεν ἕως ἑσπέρας. Καὶ ἴδεν 14
Ἰούδας, ὅτι Βακχίδης καὶ τὸ στερέωμα τῆς παρεμβολῆς ἐν τοῖς
δεξιοῖς, καὶ συνῆλθον αὐτῷ πάντες οἱ εὔψυχοι τῇ καρδίᾳ. Καὶ 15
συνέτριψαν τὸ δεξιὸν κέρας ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐδίωκον ὀπίσω αὐτῶν
ἕως Ἀζώτου ὄρους. Καὶ οἱ εἰς τὸ ἀριστερὸν κέρας ἴδον ὅτι συνε- 16
τρίβη τὸ δεξιὸν κέρας, καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν κατὰ πόδας Ἰούδα καὶ
τῶν μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἐκ τῶν ὄπισθεν. Καὶ ἐβαρύνθη ὁ πόλεμος, καὶ 17
ἔπεσαν τραυματίαι πολλοὶ ἐκ τούτων καὶ ἐκ τούτων. Καὶ Ἰού- 18
δας ἔπεσε· καὶ οἱ λοιποὶ ἔφυγον. Καὶ ἦραν Ἰωνάθαν καὶ Σίμων 19
Ἰούδαν τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτῶν καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν ἐν τῷ τάφῳ τῶν
πατέρων αὐτοῦ ἐν Μωδεεΐμ. Καὶ ἔκλαυσαν αὐτὸν ἐκεῖ, καὶ ἐκό- 20
ψαντο αὐτὸν πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ κοπετὸν μέγαν, καὶ ἐπένθουν ἡμέρας
πολλὰς, καὶ εἶπαν· Πῶς ἔπεσε δυνατὸς σώζων τὸν Ἰσραήλ; 21
Καὶ τὰ περισσὰ τῶν λόγων Ἰούδου καὶ τῶν πολέμων καὶ τῶν 22
ἀνδραγαθιῶν ὧν ἐποίησε, καὶ τῆς μεγαλωσύνης αὐτοῦ οὐ κατε-
γράφη· πολλὰ γὰρ ἦν σφόδρα. Καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ τὴν τελευ- 23
τὴν Ἰούδου, ἐξύκυψαν οἱ ἄνομοι ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς ὁρίοις Ἰσραήλ,
καὶ ἀνέτειλαν πάντες οἱ ἐργαζόμενοι τὴν ἀδικίαν. Ἐν ταῖς ἡμέ- 24
ραις ἐκείναις ἐγενήθη λιμὸς μεγάλη σφόδρα, καὶ ηὐτομόλησεν
ἡ χώρα μετ᾿ αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐξέλεξε Βακχίδης τοὺς ἀσεβεῖς ἄνδρας, 25
καὶ κατέστησεν αὐτοὺς κυρίους τῆς χώρας. Καὶ ἐξεζήτουν καὶ 26
ἐξηρεύνον τοὺς φίλους Ἰούδου, καὶ ἦγον αὐτοὺς πρὸς Βακχί-
δην καὶ ἐξεδίκει αὐτοὺς, καὶ ἐνέπαιζεν αὐτοῖς. Καὶ ἐγένετο 27
θλῖψις μεγάλη ἐν τῷ Ἰσραὴλ, ἥτις οὐκ ἐγένετο ἀφ᾿ ἧς ἡμέρας
οὐκ ὤφθη προφήτης ἐν αὐτοῖς. Καὶ ἠθροίσθησαν πάντες οἱ φί- 28

**9** ...them; for we are but few.”
**10** And Judas said, “God forbid that I should do this thing, to flee from them! Nay, if our time is drawn nigh, then let us die with manful courage for the sake of our brethren, and let us not leave any cause for reproach unto our glory.”
**11** And the host moved out from the camp, and they arrayed themselves to meet them. And the cavalry was divided into two parts, and the slingers and the archers went forth before the host, and all the chief warriors, even all the mighty men.
**12** Now Bacchides was in the right wing; and the phalanx drew nigh from the two parts, and they sounded forth with trumpets.
**13** And those with Judas also blew with the trumpets; and the earth was shaken by the voice of their hosts. And the battle was joined in full intensity from morning until evening.
**14** And Judas saw that Bacchides and the main strength of the host were in the right wing; and unto him assembled all those who were valiant in heart.
**15** And they shattered their right wing, and they pursued them unto the Mount of Azotus.
**16** And those in the left wing saw that the right wing was shattered, and they turned and pressed upon Judas and those with him from the rear.
**17** And the battle grew fierce, and many wounded fell from both sides.
**18** And Judas fell; and the rest took flight.
**19** And Jonathan and Simon bore away Judas their brother, and they buried him in the sepulchre of his fathers in Modein.
**20** And they wept for him there, and all Israel made great lamentation for him, and they mourned many days, and said,
**21** “How is the mighty fallen, the one who saved Israel!”
**22** Now the rest of the acts of Judas, and of his wars, and of the valiant deeds which he wrought, and of his great renown, were not written; for they were exceeding many.
**23** And it came to pass after the death of Judas, that the lawless ones emerged in all the borders of Israel, and all those who wrought unrighteousness rose up.
**24** In those days there came to pass a famine very great, and the land defected with them.
**25** And Bacchides chose out the ungodly men, and made them lords over the country.
**26** And they sought out and searched diligently for the friends of Judas, and they brought them unto Bacchides; and he took vengeance upon them, and dealt despitefully with them.
**27** And there was great tribulation in Israel, such as had not come to pass from the day that no prophet had been seen among them.
**28** And all the friends of Judas gathered themselves [together]…
