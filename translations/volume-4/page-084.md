51 ἐποίησαν ἐν ταῖς γενεαῖς αὐτῶν, καὶ δέξασθε δόξαν μεγάλην καὶ ὄνομα αἰώνιον.
52 Ἀβραὰμ οὐχὶ ἐν πειρασμῷ εὑρέθη πιστός, καὶ ἐλογίσθη αὐτῷ εἰς δικαιοσύνην;
53 Ἰωσὴφ ἐν καιρῷ στενοχωρίας αὐτοῦ ἐφύλαξεν ἐντολήν, καὶ ἐγένετο κύριος Αἰγύπτου.
54 Φινεὲς ὁ πατὴρ ἡμῶν ἐν τῷ ζηλῶσαι ζῆλον, ἔλαβε διαθήκην ἱερωσύνης αἰωνίας.
55 Ἰησοῦς ἐν τῷ πληρῶσαι λόγον, ἐγένετο κριτὴς ἐν Ἰσραήλ.
56 Χάλεβ ἐν τῷ ἐπιμαρτυρῆσαι τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ, ἔλαβε γῆς κληρονομίαν.
57 Δαυὶδ ἐν τῷ ἐλέει αὐτοῦ ἐκληρονόμησε θρόνον βασιλείας εἰς αἰῶνα αἰῶνος.
58 Ἡλίας ἐν τῷ ζηλῶσαι ζῆλον νόμου ἀνελήφθη ἕως εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν.
59 Ἀνανίας, Ἀζαρίας, Μισαήλ, πιστεύσαντες ἐσώθησαν ἐκ φλογός.
60 Δανιὴλ ἐν τῇ ἁπλότητι αὐτοῦ ἐρύσθη ἐκ στόματος λεόντων.
61 Καὶ οὕτως ἐννοήθητε κατὰ γενεὰν καὶ γενεάν, ὅτι πάντες οἱ ἐλπίζοντες ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν οὐκ ἀσθενήσουσι.
62 Καὶ ἀπὸ λόγων ἀνδρὸς ἁμαρτωλοῦ μὴ φοβηθῆτε, ὅτι ἡ δόξα αὐτοῦ εἰς κόπρια καὶ εἰς σκώληκας.
63 Σήμερον ἐπαρθήσεται, καὶ αὔριον οὐ μὴ εὑρεθῇ, ὅτι ἐπέστρεφεν εἰς τὸν χοῦν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὁ διαλογισμὸς αὐτοῦ ἀπώλετο.
64 Καὶ ὑμεῖς τέκνα ἰσχύετε καὶ ἀνδρίζεσθε ἐν τῷ νόμῳ ὑμῶν, ἔτι ἐν αὐτῷ δοξασθήσεσθε.
65 Καὶ ἰδοὺ Συμεὼν ὁ ἀδελφὸς ὑμῶν, οἶδα ὅτι ἀνὴρ βουλῆς ἐστιν, αὐτοῦ ἀκούετε πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας, αὐτὸς ὑμῖν ἔσται εἰς πατέρα.
66 Καὶ Ἰούδας ὁ Μακκαβαῖος αὐτὸς ἰσχυρὸς ἐν δυνάμει ἐκ νεότητος αὐτοῦ, οὗτος ὑμῖν ἔσται εἰς ἄρχοντα στρατιᾶς, καὶ πολεμήσετε πόλεμον λαῶν.
67 Καὶ ὑμεῖς προσάξατε πρὸς ὑμᾶς πάντας τοὺς ποιητὰς τοῦ νόμου, καὶ ἐκδικήσατε ἐκδίκησιν τοῦ λαοῦ ὑμῶν.
68 Ἀνταποδίδοτε ἀνταπόδομα τοῖς ἔθνεσι, καὶ προσέχετε εἰς προστάγματα τοῦ νόμου.
69 Καὶ ηὐλόγησεν αὐτούς· καὶ προσετέθη πρὸς τοὺς πατέρας αὐτοῦ.
70 Καὶ ἀπέθανεν ἐν τῷ ἑκατῷ καὶ τεσσαρακοστῷ καὶ ἑκατοστῷ ἔτει· καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ ἐν τάφοις πατέρων αὐτοῦ ἐν Μωδεεὶν, καὶ ἐκόψαντο αὐτὸν πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ κοπετὸν μέγαν.

ΚΕΦ. Γ΄.
1 ΚΑΙ ἀνέστη Ἰούδας ὁ καλούμενος Μακκαβαῖος υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ.
2 Καὶ ἐβοήθουν αὐτῷ πάντες οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντες ὅσοι ἐκολλήθησαν τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπολέμουν τὸν πόλεμον Ἰσραὴλ μετ᾿ εὐφροσύνης.
3 Καὶ ἐπλάτυνε δόξαν τῷ λαῷ αὐτοῦ·
