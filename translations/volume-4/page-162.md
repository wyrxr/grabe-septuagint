**13** Οὐκ ἄνευ δὲ ὑπάρχων, πρὸς ἑαυτὸν ἀντιβάλλων τὸ γεγονὸς περὶ αὐτὸν ἐλάττωμα, καὶ συνοήσας ἀνικήτους εἶναι τοὺς Ἑβραίους, τοῦ πάντα δυναμένου Θεοῦ συμμαχοῦντος αὐτοῖς προσαποστείλας, ἔπεισε συλλύσεσθαι ἐπὶ πᾶσι τοῖς δικαίοις, καὶ διότι
**14** καὶ τὸν βασιλέα πείσειν φίλον αὐτοῖς ἀναγκάζειν γενέσθαι.
**15** Ἐπένευσε δὲ ὁ Μακκαβαῖος ἐπὶ πᾶσιν οἷς ὁ Λυσίας παρεκάλει τοῦ συμφέροντος φροντίζων· ὅσα γὰρ ὁ Μακκαβαῖος ἐπέδωκε τῷ Λυσίᾳ διὰ γραπτῶν περὶ τῶν Ἰουδαίων, συνεχώρησεν ὁ βασιλεύς.
**16** Ἦσαν γὰρ γεγραμμέναι τοῖς Ἰουδαίοις ἐπιστολαὶ παρὰ μὲν Λυσίου, περιέχουσαι τὸν τρόπον τοῦτον· Λυσίας τῷ πλήθει τῶν Ἰουδαίων χαίρειν.
**17** Ἰωάννης καὶ Ἀβεσσαλὼμ οἱ πεμφθέντες παρ’ ὑμῶν, ἐπιδόντες τὸν ὑπογεγραμμένον χρηματισμόν, ἠξίουν περὶ τῶν δι’ αὐτοῦ σημαινομένων.
**18** Ὅσα μὲν οὖν ἔδει καὶ τῷ βασιλεῖ προσενεχθῆναι διεσάφησα, ἃ δὲ ἦν ἐνδεχόμενα συνεχώρησεν.
**19** Ἐὰν μὲν οὖν συντηρήσητε τὴν εἰς τὰ πράγματα εὔνοιαν, καὶ εἰς τὸ λοιπὸν πειράσομαι παράιτιος ὑμῖν ἀγαθῶν γενέσθαι.
**20** Ὑπὲρ δὲ τούτων κατὰ μέρος ἐντέταλμαι τούτοις τε καὶ τοῖς παρ’ ἐμοῦ διαλεχθῆναι ὑμῖν.
**21** Ἐρρώσθε. ἔτους ἑκατοστοῦ τεσσαρακοστοῦ ὀγδόου, Διοσκορινθίου τετράδι καὶ εἰκάδι.
**22** Ἡ δὲ τοῦ βασιλέως ἐπιστολὴ περιεῖχεν οὕτως· Βασιλεὺς Ἀντίοχος τῷ ἀδελφῷ Λυσίᾳ χαίρειν.
**23** Τοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν εἰς θεοὺς μεταστάντος, βουλόμενοι τοὺς ἐκ τῆς βασιλείας ἀτράχους ὄντας γενέσθαι πρὸς τὴν τῶν ἰδίων ἐπιμέλειαν, ἀκηκοότες τοὺς Ἰουδαίους μὴ συνεδοκούντας
**24** τῇ τοῦ πατρὸς εἰς τὰ Ἑλληνικὰ μεταθέσει, ἀλλὰ τὴν ἑαυτῶν ἀγωγὴν αἱρετίζοντας, ἀξίων συγχωρηθῆναι αὐτοῖς τὰ νόμιμα αὐτῶν.
**25** Αἱρούμενοι οὖν καὶ τοῦτο τὸ ἔθνος ἐκτὸς παραχῆς εἶναι, κρίνομεν τό τε ἱερὸν ἀποκατασταθῆναι αὐτοῖς, καὶ πολιτεύεσθαι κατὰ τὰ ἐπὶ τῶν προγόνων αὐτῶν ἔθη.
**26** Εὖ οὖν ποιήσεις διαπεμψάμενος πρὸς αὐτοὺς καὶ δοὺς δεξιάς, ὅπως εἰδότες τὴν ἡμετέραν προαίρεσιν, εὔθυμοι τε ὦσι, καὶ ἡδέως διαγίνωνται πρὸς τῇ τῶν ἰδίων ἀντιλήψει.
**27** Πρὸς δὲ τὸ ἔθνος ἡ τοῦ βασιλέως ἐπιστολὴ τοιάδε ἦν· Βασιλεὺς Ἀντίοχος τῇ γερουσίᾳ τῶν Ἰουδαίων καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις Ἰουδαίοις χαίρειν.
**28** Εἰ ἐρρῶσθε, εἴη ἂν ὡς βουλόμεθα· καὶ αὐτοὶ δὲ ὑγιαίνομεν.
**29** Ἐνεφάνισεν ἡμῖν Μενέλαος βούλεσθαι κατελθόντας ὑμᾶς γίνεσθαι πρὸς τοῖς ἰδίοις.
**30** Τοῖς οὖν καταπορευομένοις μέχρι τριακάδος Ξανθικοῦ ὑπάρξει

**Chapter 11**

**13** Now Lysias, being not without [counsel], but weighing within himself the defeat which had come upon him, and understanding that the Hebrews were invincible, for the Almighty God was aiding them, having sent [messengers] furthermore, he persuaded [them] to make peace upon all just terms, and [promised] that
**14** he would compel the king to become their friend.
**15** And Maccabeus consented to all the things which Lysias did request, for he considered what was advantageous; for whatsoever things Maccabeus delivered unto Lysias in writing concerning the Jews, the king did grant them.
**16** For there were letters written unto the Jews from Lysias, containing this tenor: Lysias to the multitude of the Jews, greeting.
**17** John and Absalom, who were sent from you, having presented the undersigned official communication, did request concerning the things signified thereby.
**18** Therefore, whatsoever things it was necessary to bring before the king, I made clear, and those things which were possible, he did grant.
**19** If therefore ye maintain good will toward the [royal] affairs, then for the future I shall also endeavor to be a cause of good things unto you.
**20** And concerning these things in particular, I have instructed these [men] and those from me to confer with you.
**21** Fare ye well. In the one hundred forty-eighth year, on the twenty-fourth day of Dioscorinthius.
**22** Now the king's letter contained thus: King Antiochus to [his] brother Lysias, greeting.
**23** Our father having departed to the gods, and we desiring those from the kingdom to be without trouble, that they might attend to their own affairs, having heard that the Jews did not consent
**24** to our father's change unto Greek customs, but did choose their own way of life, and [that they were] requesting that their laws be granted unto them,
**25** Therefore choosing this nation also to be without disturbance, we judge both that the temple should be restored unto them, and that they should govern themselves according to the customs of their ancestors.
**26** Thou shalt therefore do well, having sent word to them and having given pledges, so that, knowing our intention, they may be both cheerful, and may live pleasantly in the care of their own [affairs].
**27** And to the nation, the king's letter was as follows: King Antiochus to the council of the Jews and to the other Jews, greeting.
**28** If ye be well, it would be as we wish; and we ourselves also are in health.
**29** Menelaus hath shown unto us that ye desire to return and to be at your own [places].
**30** Therefore, to those who are returning until the thirtieth day of Xanthicus, there shall be
