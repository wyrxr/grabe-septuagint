ΙΟΥΔΙΘ ΚΕΦ. ςʹ.
Ἀσσοὺρ πρὸς Ἀχιὼρ ἐναντίον παντὸς τοῦ δήμου τῶν ἀλλοφύ-
λων, καὶ πρὸς πάντας τοὺς υἱοὺς Μωάβ. Καὶ τίς εἶ σύ, Ἀχιώρ,
καὶ οἱ μισθωτοὶ τοῦ Ἐφραίμ, ὅτι ἐπροφήτευσας ἐν ἡμῖν καθώς
σήμερον, καὶ εἶπας τὸ γένος Ἰσραὴλ μὴ πολεμῆσαι, ὅτι ὁ Θεὸς
αὐτῶν ὑπερασπιεῖ αὐτῶν; καὶ τίς ὁ Θεὸς εἰ μὴ Ναβουχοδονόσορ;
οὗτος ἀποστελεῖ τὸ κράτος αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐξολεθρεύσει αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ
προσώπου τῆς γῆς, καὶ οὐ ρύσεται αὐτοὺς ὁ Θεὸς αὐτῶν. Ἀλλ’
ἡμεῖς οἱ δοῦλοι αὐτοῦ πατάξομεν αὐτοὺς ὡς ἄνθρωπον ἕνα, καὶ
οὐχ ὑποστήσονται τὸ κράτος τῶν ἵππων ἡμῶν. Κατακαύσομεν
γὰρ αὐτοὺς ἐν αὐτοῖς, καὶ τὰ ὄρη αὐτῶν μεθυσθήσονται ἐν τῷ
αἵματι αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰ πεδία αὐτῶν πληρωθήσεται τῶν νεκρῶν
αὐτῶν· καὶ οὐκ ἀντιστήσεται τὸ ἴχνος τῶν ποδῶν αὐτῶν κατὰ
πρόσωπον (τῶν ποδῶν) ἡμῶν, ἀλλὰ ἀπωλείᾳ ἀπολοῦνται, λέγει
ὁ βασιλεὺς Ναβουχοδονόσορ ὁ κύριος πάσης τῆς γῆς. εἶπε γάρ,
οὐ ματαιωθήσεται τὰ ῥήματα τῶν λόγων αὐτοῦ. Σὺ δὲ Ἀχιὼρ
μισθωτὲ τοῦ Ἀμμών, ὃς ἐλάλησας τοὺς λόγους τούτους ἐν ἡμέ-
ρᾳ ἀδικίας σου, οὐκ ὄψει ἔτι τὸ πρόσωπόν μου ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέρας
ταύτης, ἕως οὗ ἐκδικήσω τὸ γένος τῶν ἐξ Αἰγύπτου. Καὶ τότε
διελεύσεται ὁ σίδηρος τῆς στρατιᾶς μου, καὶ ὁ λαὸς τῶν θερα-
πόντων μου, τὰς πλευράς σου, καὶ πεσῇ ἐν τοῖς τραυματίαις
αὐτῶν, ὅταν ἐπιστρέψω. Καὶ ἀποκαταστήσουσι σε οἱ δοῦλοί μου
εἰς τὴν ὀρεινήν, καὶ θήσουσι σε ἐν μιᾷ τῶν πόλεων τῶν ἀνα-
βάσεων, καὶ οὐκ ἀπολῇ ἕως οὗ ἐξολεθρευθῇς μετ’ αὐτῶν. Καὶ
εἴπερ ἐλπίζεις τῇ καρδίᾳ σου ὅτι οὐ συλληφθήσονται, μὴ συμ-
πεσάτω σου τὸ πρόσωπον· ἐλάλησα, καὶ οὐδὲν διαπεσεῖται τῶν
ῥημάτων μου. Καὶ προσέταξεν Ὁλοφέρνης τοῖς δούλοις αὐτοῦ,
οἳ ἦσαν παρεστηκότες ἐν τῇ σκηνῇ αὐτοῦ, συλλαβεῖν τὸν Ἀχιώρ,
καὶ ἀποκαταστῆσαι αὐτὸν εἰς Βετυλούα, καὶ παραδοῦναι εἰς χεῖ-
ρας υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ συνέλαβον αὐτὸν οἱ δοῦλοι αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἤ-
γαγον αὐτὸν ἔξω τῆς παρεμβολῆς εἰς τὸ πεδίον, καὶ ἀπῆραν ἐκ
μέσου τῆς πεδινῆς εἰς τὴν ὀρεινήν, καὶ παρεγένοντο ἐπὶ τὰς πη-
γὰς αἳ ἦσαν ὑποκάτω Βετυλούα. Καὶ ὡς εἶδαν αὐτοὺς οἱ ἄνδρες
τῆς πόλεως ἐπὶ τὴν κορυφὴν τοῦ ὄρους, ἀνέλαβον τὰ ὅπλα αὐ-
τῶν, καὶ ἀπῆλθον ἔξω τῆς πόλεως ἐπὶ τὴν κορυφὴν τοῦ ὄρους·
καὶ πᾶς ἀνὴρ σφενδονητὴς διεκράτησαν τὴν ἀνάβασιν αὐτῶν, καὶ

#### CHAPTER 6

2 [Holofernes spoke] of Assyria unto Achior, before all the multitude of the foreigners, and unto all the children of Moab, saying: "And who art thou, Achior, and the hired ones of Ephraim, that thou hast prophesied amongst us as on this day, and said that the race of Israel should not be warred against, for their God shall defend them? And who is God save Nebuchadnezzar?
3 He shall send forth his might, and shall utterly destroy them from the face of the earth; and their God shall not deliver them. But we, his servants, shall smite them as one man, and they shall not withstand the might of our horses.
4 For we shall burn them up within their [own cities], and their mountains shall be drunken with their blood, and their plains shall be filled with their dead. And the print of their feet shall not stand against the presence of our feet; but by utter destruction shall they perish, saith the King Nebuchadnezzar, the lord of all the earth. For he hath spoken, and the words of his mouth shall not be made void.
5 But thou, Achior, hired man of Ammon, who hast spoken these words on the day of thine iniquity, thou shalt no more see my face from this day forth, until I shall avenge [myself upon] the race of those who came out of Egypt.
6 And then shall the sword of my army, and the people of my servants, pass through thy sides; and thou shalt fall among their wounded, when I return.
7 And my servants shall restore thee unto the hill country, and shall place thee in one of the cities of the ascents;
8 and thou shalt not perish until thou be utterly destroyed with them. And if indeed thou hopest in thy heart that they shall not be taken, let not thy countenance fall;
9 for I have spoken, and nothing of my words shall fail."
10 And Holofernes commanded his servants, who stood by in his tent, to seize Achior, and to restore him unto Bethulia, and to deliver him into the hands of the children of Israel.
11 And his servants seized him, and led him forth out of the camp into the plain; and they departed from the midst of the plain into the hill country, and came unto the springs which were beneath Bethulia.
12 And when the men of the city saw them upon the top of the mountain, they took up their weapons, and went forth out of the city unto the top of the mountain; and every sling-man held back their ascent, and
