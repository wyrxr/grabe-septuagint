64 πέδωκαν τὰ προστάγματα τοῦ βασιλέως τοῖς βασιλικοῖς οἰκονόμοις, καὶ τοῖς ἐπάρχοις κοίλης Συρίας καὶ Φοινίκης, καὶ ἐδόξασαν τὸ ἔθνος καὶ τὸ ἱερὸν τοῦ Κυρίου.
65 Καὶ τούτων τελεσθέντων,
66 προσῆλθόν μοι οἱ ἡγούμενοι, λέγοντες· οὐκ ἐχώρισαν τὸ ἔθνος τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς καὶ οἱ Λευῖται τὰ ἀλλογενῆ ἔθνη τῆς γῆς καὶ τὰς ἀκαθαρσίας αὐτῶν ἀπὸ τῶν ἐθνῶν τῶν Χαναναίων, καὶ Χετταίων, καὶ Φερεζαίων, καὶ Ἰεβουσαίων, καὶ
67 Μωαβιτῶν, καὶ Αἰγυπτίων, καὶ Ἰδουμαίων. Συνώκησαν γὰρ μετὰ τῶν θυγατέρων αὐτῶν αὐτοὶ καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπείγῃ τὸ σπέρμα τὸ ἅγιον εἰς τὰ ἀλλογενῆ ἔθνη τῆς γῆς, καὶ μετεῖχον οἱ προηγούμενοι καὶ οἱ μεγιστᾶνες τῆς ἀνομίας ταύτης ἀπὸ τῆς ἀρχῆς τοῦ πράγματος.
68 Καὶ ἐγένετο ἅμα τῷ ἀκοῦσαί με ταῦτα, διέρῥηξα τὰ ἱμάτια καὶ τὴν ἱερὰν ἐσθῆτα, καὶ κατέτιλα τοῦ τριχώματος τῆς κεφαλῆς καὶ τοῦ πώγωνος, καὶ ἐκάθισα σύννους καὶ
69 περίλυπος. Καὶ ἐπισυνήχθησαν πρός με ὅσοι ἦσαν ζηλωταί, καὶ ὅσοι ποτε ἐπεκινοῦντο ἐπὶ τῷ ῥήματι Κυρίου Θεοῦ Ἰσραήλ, ἐμοῦ πενθοῦντος ἐπὶ τῇ ἀνομίᾳ· καὶ ἐκαθήμην περίλυπος ἕως τῆς δειλινῆς θυσίας.
70 Καὶ ἐξεγερθεὶς ἐκ τῆς νηστείας, διεῤῥηγμένα ἔχων τὰ ἱμάτια καὶ τὴν ἱερὰν ἐσθῆτα, κάμψας τὰ γόνατα, καὶ ἐκτείνας
71 τὰς χεῖρας πρὸς τὸν Κύριον, ἔλεγον· Κύριε, ᾐσχύμμαι καὶ ἐντέτραμμαι κατὰ πρόσωπόν σου.
72 Αἱ γὰρ ἁμαρτίαι ἡμῶν ἐπλεόνασαν ὑπὲρ τὰς κεφαλὰς ἡμῶν, καὶ αἱ ἄγνοιαι ἡμῶν ὑπερήνεγκαν ἕως
73 τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, ἔτι ἀπὸ τῶν χρόνων τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν, καὶ ἐσμὲν
74 ἐν μεγάλῃ ἁμαρτίᾳ ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης. Καὶ διὰ τὰς ἁμαρτίας ἡμῶν καὶ τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν παρεδόθημεν σὺν τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς ἡμῶν καὶ σὺν τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν ἡμῶν, καὶ σὺν τοῖς ἱερεῦσιν ἡμῶν, (καὶ) τοῖς βασιλεῦσι τῆς γῆς, εἰς ῥομφαίαν καὶ αἰχμαλωσίαν καὶ
75 προνομὴν μετὰ αἰσχύνης μέχρι τῆς σήμερον ἡμέρας. Καὶ νῦν κατὰ πόσον τι ἐγενήθη ἡμῖν ἔλεος παρὰ σοῦ, Κύριε, καταλειφθῆναι
76 ἡμῖν ῥίζαν καὶ ὄνομα ἐν τῷ τόπῳ τοῦ ἁγιάσματός σου; Καὶ τοῦ ἀναῖψαι φωστῆρα ἡμῶν ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν, δοῦναι
77 ἡμῖν τροφὴν ἐν τῷ καιρῷ τῆς δουλείας ἡμῶν, καὶ ἐν τῷ δουλεύειν ἡμᾶς οὐκ ἐγκατελείφθημεν ἀπὸ τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν· ἀλλ᾽ ἐποίησεν
78 ἡμᾶς ἐν χάριτι ἐνώπιον τῶν βασιλέων Περσῶν, δοῦναι ἡμῖν τροφὴν, καὶ δοξάσαι τὸ ἱερὸν τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν, καὶ ἐγεῖραι τὴν ἔρημον Σιών, δοῦναι ἡμῖν στερέωμα ἐν τῇ Ἰουδαίᾳ καὶ Ἱερουσα-

**Chapter 8**
**64** And they delivered the king's decrees unto the royal stewards, and unto the governors of Coele-Syria and Phoenicia; and they brought honor unto the nation and unto the temple of the Lord.
**65** And when these things were accomplished,
**66** Then came unto me the chief men, saying, "The nation of Israel, and the rulers, and the priests, and the Levites have not separated themselves from the foreign nations of the land, nor from their uncleanness, [even] from the nations of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and
**67** the Moabites, and the Egyptians, and the Idumeans. For they have joined themselves in marriage with their daughters, both they themselves and their sons; and the holy seed hath mingled itself among the foreign nations of the land. Yea, the chief men and the nobles have been partakers in this iniquity from the very beginning of the matter."
**68** And it came to pass, when I heard these things, that I tore my garments and my holy vestment, and I plucked out the hair of my head and of my beard, and I sat down dismayed and sore distressed.
**69** And there were gathered unto me all those who were zealous, and all who were moved by the word of the Lord God of Israel, while I mourned for this iniquity; and I sat distressed until the evening sacrifice.
**70** And having risen up from my fasting, having my garments and my holy vestment torn, I bowed my knees, and stretched forth my hands unto the Lord, [and] I said:
**71** "O Lord, I am ashamed and confounded before Thy face.
**72** For our sins are multiplied above our heads, and our transgressions have reached up unto the heavens,
**73** even from the days of our fathers; and we are
**74** in great sin until this day. And for our sins and the sins of our fathers, we have been delivered, both we and our brethren, and our kings, and our priests, [yea, even] unto the kings of the lands, unto the sword, and unto captivity, and unto
**75** plundering, with shame, even unto this present day. And now, for how little a while hath there been mercy shown unto us from Thee, O Lord, that there might be left unto us
**76** a root and a name in the place of Thy sanctuary? And to light our lamp in the House of the Lord our God; to give
**77** us sustenance in the time of our bondage? And in our servitude, we were not forsaken of our Lord; but He hath caused
**78** us to find favor before the kings of Persia, to give us sustenance, and to make glorious the temple of our Lord, and to raise up the desolate Zion, and to give us a secure dwelling in Judea and Jerusa[lem]."
