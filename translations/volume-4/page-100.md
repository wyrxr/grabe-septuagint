**ΚΕΦ. Ϛʹ. Ζʹ. ΜΑΚΚΑΒΑΙΩΝ Αʹ. 1631**
ἀπῆρε κατὰ σπουδὴν, καὶ ἀπέστρεψεν εἰς Ἀντιόχειαν, καὶ εὗρε
Φίλιππον κυριεύοντα τῆς πόλεως, καὶ ἐπολέμησε πρὸς αὐτὸν,
καὶ κατελάβετο τὴν πόλιν βίᾳ.

**ΚΕΦ. Ζʹ. VII.**

**1** ΕΤΟΥΣ ἑνὸς καὶ πεντηκοστοῦ καὶ ἑκατοστοῦ ἐξῆλθε Δημήτριος ὁ τοῦ Σελεύκου ἐκ Ῥώμης, καὶ ἀνέβη σὺν ἀνδράσιν ὀλίγοις
εἰς πόλιν παραθαλασσίαν, καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν ἐκεῖ. **2** Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς εἰσεπορεύετο εἰς οἶκον βασιλείας πατέρων αὐτοῦ, συνέλαβον αἱ δυνάμεις τὸν Ἀντίοχον καὶ τὸν Λυσίαν ἀγαγεῖν αὐτοὺς αὐτῷ. **3** Καὶ ἐγνώσθη αὐτῷ τὸ πρᾶγμα καὶ εἶπε· μή μοι δείξητε τὰ πρόσωπα
αὐτῶν. **4** Καὶ ἀπέκτειναν αὐτοὺς αἱ δυνάμεις, καὶ ἐκάθισε Δημήτριος ἐπὶ θρόνου βασιλείας αὐτοῦ. **5** Καὶ ἦλθον πρὸς αὐτὸν πάντες ἄνδρες ἄνομοι καὶ ἀσεβεῖς ἐξ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ Ἄλκιμος ἡγεῖτο
αὐτῶν βουλόμενος ἱερατεύειν. **6** Καὶ κατηγόρησαν τοῦ λαοῦ πρὸς
τὸν βασιλέα, λέγοντες· ἀπώλεσεν Ἰούδας καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ
πάντας τοὺς φίλους σου, καὶ ἡμᾶς ἐσκόρπισεν ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς ἡμῶν.
**7** Νῦν οὖν ἀπόστειλον ἄνδρα ᾧ πιστεύεις, καὶ πορευθεὶς ἰδέτω τὴν
ἐξολέθρευσιν ἅπασαν, ἣν ἐποίησεν ἡμῖν καὶ τῇ χώρᾳ τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ κολασάτω αὐτοὺς καὶ πάντας τοὺς ἐπιβοηθοῦντας αὐτοῖς. **8** Καὶ ἐπέλεξεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τὸν Βακχίδην τὸν φίλον τοῦ
βασιλέως κυριεύοντα ἐν τῷ πέραν τοῦ ποταμοῦ καὶ μέγαν ἐν τῇ
βασιλεία καὶ πιστὸν τῷ βασιλεῖ. **9** Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν αὐτὸν καὶ
Ἄλκιμον τὸν ἀσεβῆ, καὶ ἔστησεν αὐτῷ τὴν ἱερωσύνην, καὶ ἐνετείλατο αὐτῷ ποιῆσαι τὴν ἐκδίκησιν ἐν τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ. **10** Καὶ
ἀπῆραν, καὶ ἦλθον μετὰ δυνάμεως πολλῆς εἰς γῆν Ἰούδα· καὶ
ἀπέστειλεν ἀγγέλους πρὸς Ἰούδαν καὶ τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ λόγοις εἰρηνικοῖς μετὰ δόλου. **11** Καὶ οὐ προσείχον τοῖς λόγοις αὐτῶν· ἴδον γὰρ, ὅτι ἦλθεν μετὰ δυνάμεως πολλῆς. **12** Καὶ ἔπισυνήχθησαν πρὸς Ἄλκιμον καὶ Βακχίδην συναγωγὴ γραμματέων ἐκζητῆσαι δίκαια. **13** Καὶ πρῶτοι οἱ Ἀσιδαῖοι ἦσαν ἐν υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ,
καὶ ἐπεζήτουν παρ' αὐτῶν εἰρήνην. **14** Εἶπαν γὰρ· ἄνθρωπος ἱερεὺς ἐκ τοῦ σπέρματος Ἀαρὼν ἦλθεν ἐν ταῖς δυνάμεσι, καὶ οὐκ
ἀδικήσει ἡμᾶς. **15** Καὶ ἐλάλησε μετ' αὐτῶν εἰρηνικοὺς λόγους, καὶ
ὤμοσεν αὐτοῖς, λέγων· οὐκ ἐκζητήσομεν ὑμῖν κακόν, καὶ τοῖς

### Chapter 6

So he departed with haste, and returned unto Antioch; and he found Philip holding sway over the city; and he made war against him, and took the city by force.

### Chapter 7

**1** In the one hundred and fifty-first year, Demetrius, the son of Seleucus, went forth from Rome, and came up with a few men unto a city by the sea, and there he reigned.
**2** And it came to pass, as he did enter into the house of the kingdom of his fathers, the host laid hold upon Antiochus and upon Lysias, to bring them unto him.
**3** And the matter was made known unto him, and he spake, saying, "Show not their faces unto me!"
**4** And the host slew them; and Demetrius sat upon the throne of his kingdom.
**5** And there came unto him all the lawless men and the ungodly from Israel, and Alcimus was their leader, desiring to be high priest.
**6** And they brought accusations against the people before the king, saying, "Judas and his brethren have destroyed all thy friends, and have scattered us from our own land.
**7** Now therefore, send forth a man in whom thou dost trust, and let him go and behold all the destruction which he hath wrought against us and against the land of the king; and let him punish them and all those who give succor unto them."
**8** Then the king chose Bacchides, who was a friend of the king, and governor in the land beyond the [Euphrates] River, a man great in the kingdom and faithful unto the king.
**9** And he sent him forth with Alcimus the ungodly, and established for him the priesthood; and he commanded him to execute vengeance upon the sons of Israel.
**10** And they departed, and came with a mighty force into the land of Judah; and he sent messengers unto Judas and his brethren, speaking words of peace, yet with guile.
**11** But they heeded not their words, for they saw that he was come with a mighty force.
**12** And there gathered themselves together unto Alcimus and Bacchides a company of scribes, to seek what was just.
**13** And first among the sons of Israel were the Hasideans, and they sought peace from them.
**14** For they spake, saying, "A priest, a man of the seed of Aaron, is come with the forces, and he shall do us no wrong."
**15** And he spake unto them words of peace, and sware unto them, saying, "We shall seek no harm for you, nor for your friends."
