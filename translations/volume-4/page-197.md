8 στρατιωτῶν· τότε δὲ γενομένης ἑσπέρας, ὑδρῶν καὶ σφόδρα κεκαμηκώς, ἐπὶ τὴν βασίλειον σκηνὴν ἦλθε, περὶ ἣν ὁ πᾶς τῶν προ-
9 γόνων στρατὸς ἐστρατοπέδευκεν. Οἱ μὲν οὖν ἄλλοι πάντες ἐπὶ
10 τὸ δεῖπνον ἦσαν. Ὁ δὲ βασιλεὺς ὡς μάλιστα διψῶν, καίπερ ἀ-
11 φθόνους ἔχων πηγάς, οὐκ ἠδύνατο δι᾽ αὐτῶν ἰάσασθαι τὴν δίψαν·
12 ἀλλά τις αὐτῶν ἀλόγιστος ἐπιθυμία τοῦ παρὰ τοῖς πολεμίοις
13 ὕδατος ἐπιτείνουσα συνέρρυγεν, καὶ λύουσα κατέφλεγεν. Ὅθεν
14 τῶν ὑπερασπιστῶν ἐπὶ τῇ τοῦ βασιλέως ἐπιθυμίᾳ σχετλιαζόν-
15 των, δύο νεανίσκοι στρατιῶται καρτεροὶ καταϊδεσθέντες τὴν τοῦ
16 βασιλέως ἐπιθυμίαν, τὰς πανοπλίας καθωπλίσαντο, καὶ κάλπην
17 λαβόντες ὑπερέβησαν τοὺς τῶν πολεμίων χάρακας· καὶ λαβόν-
18 τες τοὺς τῶν πυλῶν ἀκροφύλακας, διεξῆσαν ἀνευρυνόμενοι κατὰ
19 πᾶν τὸ τῶν πολεμίων στρατόπεδον. Καὶ ἀνευράμενοι θαῤῥα-
20 λέως τὴν πηγὴν, ἐξ αὐτῆς ἐγέμισαν τῷ βασιλεῖ τὸ ποτόν. Ὁ
21 δὲ καίπερ τῇ δίψῃ διαπυρούμενος, ἐλογίσατο πάνδεινον εἶναι κίν-
22 δυνον τῇ ψυχῇ λογισθὲν ἰσοδύναμον τὸ ποτὸν αἵματι. Ὅθεν ἀν-
23 τιθεὶς τῇ ἐπιθυμίᾳ τὸν λογισμὸν, ἔσπεισε τὸ πόμα τῷ Θεῷ.
24 Δυνατὸς γὰρ ὁ σώφρων, ὡς ἔφη, νοῦς νικῆσαι τὰς τῶν παθῶν
25 ἀνάγκας, καὶ σβέσαι τὰς τῶν οἴστρων φλεγμονὰς, καὶ τὰς τῶν σω-
26 μάτων ἀλγηδόνας καθ᾽ ὑπερβολὴν οὔσας καταπαλαῖσαι, καὶ τῇ
27 καλοκαγαθίᾳ τοῦ λογισμοῦ ἀποπτύσαι πάσας τὰς τῶν παθῶν ἐπι-
28 κρατείας. Ἤδη δὲ καὶ ὁ καιρὸς ἡμᾶς καλεῖ ἐπὶ τὴν ἀπόδειξιν
29 τῆς θεωρίας τοῦ σώφρονος λογισμοῦ. Ἐπειδὴ γὰρ βαθεῖαν εἰρή-
30 νην διὰ τὴν εὐνομίαν οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν εἶχον, καὶ ἔπραττον κα-
31 λῶς, ὥστε καὶ τὸν τῆς Ἀσίας βασιλέα Σέλευκον καὶ τὸν Νικάνορα
32 καὶ χρήματα εἰς τὴν ἱερουργίαν αὐτοῖς ἀποφορῖσαι, καὶ τὴν πολι-
33 τείαν αὐτῶν ἀποδέχεσθαι· τότε δή τινες πρὸς τὴν κοινὴν νεωτε-
34 ρίσαντες ἐμμονίαν, πολυτρόποις ἐχρήσαντο συμφοραῖς.

**CHAPTER III.**

**8** soldiers. Then, when the evening was come, being parched with thirst and exceedingly weary, he came unto the royal tent, about which the whole army of his forefathers was encamped.
**9** Now all the others were gone to supper;
**10** but the king, being most thirsty, albeit he had fountains in abundance,
**11** yet could he not assuage his thirst by means of them;
**12** but a certain irrational desire for the water from amongst the enemy did intensify within him and burst forth,
**13** and, dissolving [his strength], it did consume him.
**14** Wherefore, as his bodyguards grieved over the king's desire, two valiant young soldiers, perceiving the king's desire,
**15** did arm themselves with their full panoply, and taking a water jar, they crossed over the palisades of the enemy;
**16** and having overcome the warders of the gates, they passed through, spreading themselves throughout all the camp of their foes.
**17** And having fearlessly discovered the spring, they did fill from it the drink for the king.
**18** But he, though being consumed by the very flames of thirst, did reckon it a dire peril unto his soul, should that drink be esteemed as equivalent unto blood. Wherefore, setting Reason against his desire, he poured out the draught as a libation unto God.
**19** For mighty is the temperate mind, as I did declare, to overcome the exigencies of the passions, and to quench the burning inflammations of sharp desires,
**20** and to wrestle down the pains of the body, howbeit they be excessive, and by the moral excellence of Reason to cast out all the dominion of the passions.
**21** Now doth the time also call us unto the demonstration of the theory of temperate Reason. For inasmuch as our fathers did enjoy a profound peace by reason of their good governance,
**22** and did fare well, insomuch that even Seleucus, the king of Asia, and Nicanor, did send money unto them for their sacred service,
**23** and did approve of their commonwealth; then truly did certain men, having made innovations against the common steadfastness,
**24** bring forth manifold calamities.

**CHAPTER IV.**

**1** For a certain Simon, being a political adversary unto Onias, who once did hold the high priesthood for life, a man both noble and good,
**2** since he could not in any wise harm him by slandering him concerning the nation, did go into exile, betraying his native land.
**3** Whereupon, coming unto Apollonius, the general of Syria, and of Phoenicia, and of Cilicia, he spake, saying: "Being well-disposed unto the affairs of the king, I am come to disclose that many tens of thousands of private moneys are laid up in the treasuries of Jerusalem, which do not pertain unto the Temple, and that these do rightly belong unto Seleucus the king."
