ΚΕΦ. Γ΄. III

ΚΥΡΙΕ παντοκράτωρ ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ, ψυχὴ ἐν στενοῖς, καὶ 1
πνεῦμα ἀκηδιῶν ἐκέκραξε πρὸς σέ, ἄκουσον, Κύριε, καὶ ἐλέησον, 2
ὅτι Θεὸς ἐλεήμων εἶ· καὶ ἐλέησον, ὅτι ἡμάρτομεν ἐναντίον σου, 3
ὅτι σὺ καθήμενος τὸν αἰῶνα, καὶ ἡμεῖς ἀπολύμενοι τὸν αἰῶνα. 4
Κύριε, παντοκράτωρ ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ, ἄκουσον δὴ τῆς προσευχῆς 5
τῶν τεθνηκότων Ἰσραήλ, καὶ υἱῶν τῶν ἁμαρτανόντων ἐναντίον 6
σου, οἳ οὐκ ἤκουσαν τῆς φωνῆς σου τοῦ Θεοῦ αὐτῶν, καὶ προσεκολλήθη 7
ἡμῖν τὰ κακά. Μὴ μνησθῇς ἀδικιῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν, ἀλλὰ μνήσθητι 8
χειρός σου καὶ ὀνόματός σου ἐν τῷ καιρῷ τούτῳ, ὅτι σὺ Κύριος 9
ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν, καὶ αἰνέσομέν σε, Κύριε, ὅτι διὰ τοῦτο ἔδωκας τὸν 10
φόβον σου ἐπὶ καρδίαν ἡμῶν τοῦ ἐπικαλεῖσθαι τὸ ὄνομά σου· 11
καὶ αἰνέσομέν σε ἐν τῇ ἀποικίᾳ ἡμῶν, ὅτι ἀπεστρέψαμεν ἀπὸ 12
καρδίας ἡμῶν πᾶσαν ἀδικίαν πατέρων ἡμῶν, τῶν ἡμαρτηκό- 13
των ἐναντίον σου. Ἰδοὺ ἡμεῖς σήμερον ἐν τῇ ἀποικίᾳ ἡμῶν, 14
οὗ διέσπειρας ἡμᾶς ἐκεῖ εἰς ὀνειδισμόν, καὶ εἰς ἀράν, καὶ εἰς 15
ἔφλησιν κατὰ πάσας τὰς ἀδικίας πατέρων ἡμῶν, οἳ ἀπέστησαν 16
ἀπὸ Κυρίου Θεοῦ ἡμῶν. ῎Ακουε, Ἰσραήλ, ἐντολὰς ζωῆς, ἐνω- 17
τίσασθε γνῶναι φρόνησιν. Τί ἐστιν Ἰσραήλ; τί ὅτι ἐν τῇ γῇ 18
τῶν ἐχθρῶν εἶ; ἐπαλαιώθης ἐν γῇ ἀλλοτρίᾳ, συμιάνθης τοῖς 19
νεκροῖς, προσελογίσθης μετὰ τῶν εἰς ᾅδου, ἐγκατέλιπες τὴν 20
πηγὴν τῆς σοφίας, τῇ ὁδῷ τοῦ Θεοῦ εἰ ἐπορεύθης, κατώκεις 21
ἣν ἐν εἰρήνῃ τὸν αἰῶνα χρόνον. Μάθε ποῦ ἐστι φρόνησις, ποῦ ἐστιν 22
ἰσχύς, ποῦ ἐστι σύνεσις, τοῦ γνῶναι ἅμα ποῦ ἐστι μακροβίωσις 23
καὶ ζωή, ποῦ ἐστι φῶς ὀφθαλμῶν καὶ εἰρήνη. Τίς εὗρε τὸν τόπον 24
αὐτῆς, καὶ τίς εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τοὺς θησαυροὺς αὐτῆς; Ποῦ εἰσιν οἱ 25
ἄρχοντες τῶν ἐθνῶν, καὶ οἱ κυριεύοντες τῶν θηρίων τῶν ἐπὶ τῆς 26
γῆς, οἳ ἐν τοῖς ὀρνέοις τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ἐμπαίζοντες, καὶ τὸ ἀργύριον 27
θησαυρίζοντες, καὶ τὸ χρυσίον ᾧ ἐπεποίθεισαν ἄνθρωποι, καὶ 28
οὐκ ἔστι τέλος τῆς κτήσεως αὐτῶν; Ὅτι οἱ τὸ ἀργύριον τεκ- 29
ταίνοντες καὶ μεριμνῶντες, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἐξεύρεσις τῶν ἔργων 30
αὐτῶν. Ἠφανίσθησαν, καὶ εἰς ᾅδου κατέβησαν, καὶ ἄλλοι ἀντα- 31
νέστησαν ἀντ᾿ αὐτῶν. Νεώτεροι ἰδόντες φῶς, καὶ κατώκησαν ἐπὶ 32
τῆς γῆς, ὁδὸν δὲ ἐπιστήμης οὐκ ἔγνωσαν, οὐδὲ συνῆκαν τρίβους 33

**CHAPTER III.**

**1** O Lord Almighty, God of Israel, a soul in anguish and a spirit desponding hath cried unto Thee;
**2** Hear, O Lord, and have mercy,
**3** for Thou art a God of mercy; and have mercy, for we have sinned before Thee.
**4** For Thou abidest for ever, and we are but mortals, ever passing away.
**5** O Lord Almighty, God of Israel, hearken now unto the prayer
**6** of the dead of Israel, and of the sons of them that have sinned before
**7** Thee, who hearkened not unto the voice of Thee, their God; and the evils have cleaved
**8** unto us. Remember not the iniquities of our fathers, but remember
**9** Thy hand and Thy Name in this season, for Thou art the Lord
**10** our God; and we will praise Thee, O Lord, for unto this end Thou hast put
**11** Thy fear upon our hearts, that we might call upon Thy Name;
**12** and we will praise Thee in the land of our captivity, because we have turned away from
**13** our hearts all the iniquity of our fathers, who sinned
**14** before Thee. Behold, we are this day in the land of our captivity,
**15** where Thou hast scattered us, there to be a reproach, and a curse, and a
**16** devastation, according to all the iniquities of our fathers, who turned away
**17** from the Lord our God. Hear, O Israel, the commandments of life; incline your
**18** ears to know understanding. What is it, O Israel? What is it, that thou art in the land
**19** of thine enemies? Thou art grown old in a strange land, thou art defiled with the
**20** dead, thou art accounted with those that go down to Hades, thou hast forsaken the
**21** fountain of wisdom. If thou hadst walked in the way of God, thou shouldst have dwelt
**22** [therein] in peace for ever. Learn where wisdom is, where strength is, where understanding is, to know
**23** also where is length of days and life, where is the light of the eyes and peace.
**24** Who hath found her place, and who hath entered into her treasuries?
**25** Where are the princes of the nations, and they that lord it over the beasts that are upon the
**26** earth, who make sport among the fowls of the air, and hoard up silver,
**27** and gold, wherein men trusted, and there is no end of their getting?
**28** For they that fashioned the silver, and were anxious,
**29** and there is no discovery of their works. They vanished, and went down to Hades,
**30** and others rose up in their stead. The younger [ones] saw light, and dwelt upon
**31** the earth; yet the way of knowledge they knew not, nor understood the paths
**32** thereof.
