γενομένων διελάθεν ἀποστατεῖν τὴν Ἰουδαίαν· ὅθεν ἀναζεύξας
ἐξ Αἰγύπτου τεθηριωμένος τῇ ψυχῇ, ἔλαβε τὴν μὲν πόλιν δορυά-
**12** λωτον. Καὶ ἐκέλευσε τοῖς στρατιώταις κόπτειν ἀφειδῶς τοὺς
ἐμπίπτοντας, καὶ τοὺς εἰς τὰς οἰκίας ἀναβαίνοντας κατασφάζειν.
**13** Ἐγίνετο δὲ νέων καὶ πρεσβυτέρων ἀναίρεσις, ἀνδρῶν τε καὶ γυ-
ναικῶν καὶ τέκνων ἀφανισμός, παρθένων τε καὶ νηπίων σφαγαί.
**14** Ὀκτὼ δὲ μυριάδες ἐν ταῖς πάσαις ἡμέραις τρισὶ κατεφθάρησαν·
τέσσαρες μὲν ἐν χειρῶν νομαῖς, οὐχ ἧττον δὲ τῶν ἐσφαγμένων
**15** ἐπράθησαν. Οὐκ ἀρκεσθεὶς δὲ τούτοις, κατετόλμησεν εἰς τὸ πά-
σης τῆς γῆς ἁγιώτατον ἱερὸν εἰσελθεῖν, ὁδηγὸν ἔχων τὸν Με-
νέλαον, τὸν καὶ τῶν νόμων καὶ τῆς πατρίδος προδότην γεγο-
**16** νότα. Καὶ ταῖς μιαραῖς χερσὶ τὰ ἱερὰ σκεύη λαμβάνων, καὶ
τὰ ὑπ᾿ ἄλλων βασιλέων ἀνατεθέντα πρὸς αὔξησιν καὶ δόξαν τοῦ
**17** τόπου καὶ τιμὴν, ταῖς βεβήλοις χερσὶ συσύρρων ἐπεδίδου. Καὶ
ἐμετεωρίζετο τὴν διάνοιαν ὁ Ἀντίοχος, οὐ συνορῶν ὅτι διὰ τὰς
ἁμαρτίας τῶν τὴν πόλιν οἰκούντων ἀπώργισται βραχέως ὁ δε-
**18** σπότης, διὸ γέγονε περὶ τὸν τόπον παρόρασις. Εἰ δὲ μὴ συνέβη
προτενέχθαι πολλοῖς ἁμαρτήμασι, καθάπερ ἦν ὁ Ἡλιόδωρος ὁ
πεμφθεὶς ὑπὸ Σελεύκου τοῦ βασιλέως ἐπὶ τὴν ἐπίσκεψιν τοῦ γα-
ζοφυλακίου, οὕτως πραχθεὶς παραχρῆμα μαστιγωθεὶς ἀνετράπη
**19** τοῦ θράσους. Ἀλλ᾿ οὐ διὰ τὸν τόπον τὸ ἔθνος, διὰ τὸ ἔθνος
**20** τὸν τόπον ὁ Κύριος ἐξελέξατο. Διόπερ καὶ αὐτὸς ὁ τόπος συμ-
μετασχὼν τῶν τοῦ ἔθνους δυσπετημάτων γενομένων, ὕστερον
εὐεργετημάτων ὑπὸ τοῦ Κυρίου ἐκοινώνησε, καὶ ὁ καταληφθεὶς
ἐν τῇ τοῦ παντοκράτορος ὀργῇ, πάλιν ἐν τῇ τοῦ μεγάλου δεσπό-
**21** του καταλλαγῇ μετὰ πάσης δόξης ἐπανωρθώθη. Ὁ οὖν Ἀν-
τίοχος ὀκτακόσια πρὸς τοῖς χιλίοις ἀπενεγκάμενος ἐκ τοῦ ἱεροῦ
τάλαντα θᾶττον εἰς τὴν Ἀντιόχειαν ἐχωρίσθη, οἰόμενος ἀπὸ
τῆς ὑπερηφανίας τὴν μὲν γῆν πλωτὴν καὶ τὸ πέλαγος πορευ-

#### CHAPTER V.

...[these things] having occurred, it escaped him not that Judea had revolted. Wherefore, departing from Egypt, with a spirit greatly incensed, he took the city by force of arms.
**12** And he commanded his soldiers to smite unsparingly all whom they met, and to slay those who entered into the houses.
**13** And there was a slaying of young and old, a destruction of men and women and children, and a slaughter of virgins and infants.
**14** And in three whole days did eighty thousand perish; forty thousand in the clash of hands, and no fewer than those who were slain were sold into captivity.
**15** But not content with these atrocities, he dared to enter the most holy temple in all the earth, having Menelaus as his guide, who had become a betrayer both of the laws and of his own country.
**16** And with his polluted hands did he take the holy vessels, and those things which other kings had dedicated for the increase, and glory, and honour of the place, did he, with his profane hands, drag forth and distribute.
**17** And Antiochus was lifted up in his heart, not perceiving that for the sins of them that dwelt in the city, the Lord had been wroth for a little while, and for this cause had there been an oversight concerning the place.
**18** For had it not been that they were burdened with many transgressions, as was Heliodorus, who was sent by King Seleucus to examine the treasury, so too would Antiochus have been scourged immediately and turned back from his audaciousness.
**19** But the Lord chose not the nation for the place's sake, but the place for the nation's sake.
**20** Wherefore, the place itself, having partaken of the calamities that befell the nation, did afterwards partake also of the benefactions from the Lord. And that which was forsaken in the wrath of the Almighty, was again, in the reconciliation of the great Lord, restored with all glory.
**21** Therefore Antiochus, having carried away from the temple one thousand and eight hundred talents, did quickly depart unto Antioch, supposing in his arrogance that he could make the land navigable and the sea passable, by reason of the lifting up of his heart.
**22** And he left behind him also governors to afflict the nation: in Jerusalem, Philip, who was by birth a Phrygian, and in manners more barbarous than he that appointed him.
**23** And in Gerizim, Andronicus. And in addition to these, Menelaus, who above all others did deal most wickedly with the citizens, having indeed a hostile disposition towards the Jewish citizens.
**24** Moreover, he sent Apollonius, the chief of abominations, with an army [of two and twenty thousand men]...
