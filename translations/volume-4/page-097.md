**6:14** ταῦτα· καὶ ἰδοὺ ἀπόλλυμαι λύπῃ μεγάλῃ ἐν γῇ ἀλλοτρίᾳ. Καὶ ἐκάλεσε Φίλιππον ἕνα τῶν φίλων αὐτοῦ, καὶ κατέστησεν αὐτὸν
**6:15** ἐπὶ πάσης τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ τὸ διάδημα καὶ τὴν στολὴν αὐτοῦ καὶ τὸν δακτύλιον, τοῦ ἀγαγεῖν Ἀντίοχον τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐκθρέψαι αὐτὸν τοῦ βασιλεύειν.
**6:16** Καὶ ἀπέθανεν ἐκεῖ Ἀντίοχος ὁ βασιλεὺς ἔτους ἐνάτου καὶ τεσσαρακοστοῦ καὶ ἑκατοστοῦ.
**6:17** Καὶ ἐπέγνω Λυσίας ὅτι τέθνηκεν ὁ βασιλεύς, καὶ κατέστησε βασιλεύειν Ἀντίοχον τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ, ὃν ἐξέθρεψε νεώτερον, καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Εὐπάτωρ.
**6:18** Καὶ οἱ ἐκ τῆς ἄκρας ἦσαν συγκλείοντες τὸν Ἰσραὴλ κύκλῳ τῶν ἁγίων, καὶ ζητοῦντες κακὰ δι᾿ ὅλου καὶ στήριγμα τοῖς ἔθνεσι.
**6:19** Καὶ ἐλογίσατο Ἰούδας ἐξᾶραι αὐτούς· καὶ ἐξεκκλησίασε
**6:20** πάντα τὸν λαὸν τοῦ περικαθίσαι ἐπ᾿ αὐτούς. Καὶ συνήχθησαν ἅμα, καὶ περιεκάθισαν ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς ἔτους πεντηκοστοῦ καὶ ἑκατοστοῦ,
**6:21** καὶ ἐποίησεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς βελοστασίας καὶ μηχανάς. Καὶ ἐξῆλθον ἐξ αὐτῶν ἐκ τοῦ συγκλεισμοῦ, καὶ ἐκολλήθησαν αὐτοῖς
**6:22** τινὲς τῶν ἀσεβῶν ἐξ Ἰσραὴλ· καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα καὶ εἶπαν· ἕως πότε οὐ ποιήσεις κρίσιν, καὶ ἐκδικήσεις τοὺς
**6:23** ἀδελφοὺς ἡμῶν; Ἡμεῖς εὐδοκοῦμεν δουλεύειν τῷ πατρί σου, καὶ πορεύεσθαι τοῖς ὑπ᾿ αὐτοῦ λεγομένοις, καὶ κατακολουθεῖν τοῖς
**6:24** προστάγμασιν αὐτοῦ· καὶ περικάθηνται εἰς τὴν ἄκραν, ὅτι οὐ τοῦ λαοῦ ἡμῶν χάριν τούτου ἠλλοτριοῦντο ἀφ᾿ ἡμῶν πλὴν ὅσοι εὑ-
**6:25** ρίσκοντο ἀφ᾿ ἡμῶν ἐθανατοῦντο καὶ αἱ κληρονομίαι ἡμῶν διηρπάζοντο. Καὶ οὐκ ἐφ᾿ ἡμᾶς μόνον ἐξέτειναν χεῖρα, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐπὶ
**6:26** πάντα τὰ ὅρια αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἰδοὺ παρεμβεβλήκασι σήμερον ἐπὶ τὴν ἄκραν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, τοῦ καταλαβέσθαι αὐτὴν καὶ τὸ ἁγίασμα,
**6:27** καὶ τὴν Βαιθσούραν ὠχύρωσαν. Καὶ ἐὰν μὴ προκαταλάβῃ αὐτοὺς διατάχους, μείζονα τούτων ποιήσουσι, καὶ οὐ δυνή-
**6:28** σῃ τοῦ κατασχεῖν αὐτῶν. Καὶ ὠργίσθη ὁ βασιλεύς, ὅτε ἤκουσε, καὶ συνήγαγε πάντας τοὺς φίλους αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοὺς ἄρχοντας δυνάμεως
**6:29** αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοὺς ἐπὶ τῶν ἡνιῶν. Καὶ ἀπὸ βασιλειῶν ἑτέρων καὶ ἀπὸ νήσων θαλασσῶν ἦλθον πρὸς αὐτὸν δυνάμεις μισθωταί.
**6:30** Καὶ ἦν ὁ ἀριθμὸς τῶν δυνάμεων αὐτοῦ ἑκατὸν χιλιάδες πεζῶν, καὶ εἴκοσι χιλιάδες τῶν ἵππων, καὶ ἐλέφαντες δύο
**6:31** καὶ τριάκοντα εἰδότες πόλεμον. Καὶ ἦλθον διὰ τῆς Ἰδουμαίας, καὶ παρενέβαλον ἐπὶ Βαιθσούρᾳ, καὶ ἐπολέμησαν ἐπὶ ἡμέρας

### Chapter 6

**14** these things; and lo, I perish by reason of great sorrow in a strange land. And he called Philip, one of his friends, and appointed him
**15** over all his kingdom. And he gave unto him the diadem, and his robe, and his ring, to the end that he should bring up Antiochus his son, and nourish him up to reign.
**16** And there died King Antiochus in the one hundred and forty-ninth year.
**17** And Lysias knew that the king was dead, and he set up Antiochus his son to reign in his stead, whom he had nurtured while yet young, and he called his name Eupator.
**18** Now they that were in the citadel held Israel in a strait about the sanctuary, and sought mischief at every turn, and were a stay unto the Gentiles.
**19** And Judas determined to destroy them; and he gathered
**20** all the people to lay siege unto them. And they assembled together, and besieged them in the one hundred and fiftieth year.
**21** And he made against them engines of war and machines. And there went forth from among them [who were in the citadel] out of the siege, and certain of the ungodly from Israel joined themselves unto them,
**22** and went unto the king, and said, "How long wilt thou not execute judgment, nor avenge our
**23** brethren? We were well content to serve thy father, and to walk according to the things spoken by him, and to cleave unto his
**24** commandments. And they now besiege the citadel, [and they falsely allege] that not for the sake of this our people were [we] estranged from them;
**25** but rather, as many of us as were found among us were put to death, and our inheritances were plundered. Neither did they stretch forth their hand upon us only, but also upon
**26** all their borders. And lo, they have encamped this day against the citadel in Jerusalem, for to take it and the sanctuary,
**27** and Beth-zur have they fortified. And if thou prevent them not with speed, they shall do greater things than these, and thou shalt not be able
**28** to restrain them." And the king waxed wroth when he heard, and he gathered all his friends, and the captains of his
**29** power, and them that were over the chariots. And from other kingdoms, and from the islands of the sea, came hired forces unto him.
**30** And the number of his forces was an hundred thousand footmen, and twenty thousand horsemen, and two
**31** and thirty elephants, trained for war. And they came through Idumaea, and pitched camp against Beth-zur, and warred against it for many days.
