#### CHAPTER II.

**7** it shall be until God gathers together the ingathering of the people, and becomes merciful.
**8** And then the Lord shall reveal these things, and the glory of the Lord and the cloud shall appear, as it was manifested in the days of Moses, and as Solomon also desired, that the place might be greatly sanctified.
**9** And it was also made clear how that, having wisdom, he offered a sacrifice of the dedication and of the completion of the sanctuary.
**10** As also Moses prayed unto the Lord, and fire came down from heaven and consumed the things of the sacrifice; so also Solomon prayed unto the Lord, and the fire, having come down, consumed the burnt offerings.
**11** And Moses said, that because the [offering] concerning sin was not eaten, it was consumed.
**12** Likewise also Solomon kept the eight days.
**13** And the same things were explained both in the records and in the commentaries concerning Nehemiah, and how that, having established a library, he gathered together the books concerning the kings and the prophets, and those of David, and the letters of kings concerning dedicated gifts.
**14** Likewise also Judas gathered together all the things that had been scattered because of the war that had come upon us; and they are with us.
**15** Wherefore, if you have need of any of these things, send those who shall bring them unto you.
**16** Therefore, as we are about to keep the purification, we have written unto you; wherefore, you shall do well to keep the days [of the feast].
**17** And the God who saved all His people, and restored unto all His inheritance, and the kingdom, and the priesthood, and the sanctification, as He promised through the Law;
**18** for we hope in God that He will quickly have mercy upon us, and will gather us from all that is under heaven into the holy place; for He hath delivered us from great evils, and hath sanctified the place.
**19** Now concerning Judas Maccabeus and his brethren, and the purification of the most great sanctuary, and the dedication of the altar;
**20** and moreover the wars against Antiochus Epiphanes and his son Eupator;
**21** and the heavenly manifestations that were given unto them that did nobly contend for Judaism, so that, being few in number, they did despoil the whole country, and did pursue the barbarian multitudes;
**22** and to recover the temple, which was renowned throughout the whole world, and to liberate the city, and to rectify the laws that were about to be abolished, the Lord having become merciful unto them with all clemency.
**23** The things which were narrated by Jason of Cyrene in five books, we shall attempt
