13 ἐλπὶς αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τὸν σώζοντα αὐτοὺς·
14 ὁ φοβούμενος Κύριον οὐ μὴ πολλὰ εὐλαβήσεται, καὶ οὐ μὴ δειλιάσῃ, ὅτι αὐτὸς ἐλπὶς αὐτοῦ·
15 φοβουμένου τὸν Κύριον μακαρία ἡ ψυχή· τίνι ἐπέχει; καὶ τίς αὐτοῦ στήριγμα;
16 Οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ Κυρίου ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀγαπῶντας αὐτόν· ὑπερασπισμὸς δυναστείας καὶ στήριγμα ἰσχύος, σκέπη ἀπὸ καύσωνος καὶ σκέπη ἀπὸ μεσημβρίας, φυλακὴ ἀπὸ προσκόμματος καὶ βοήθεια ἀπὸ πτώσεως·
17 ἀνυψῶν ψυχὴν καὶ φωτίζων ὀφθαλμούς, ἴασιν διδούς, ζωὴν καὶ εὐλογίαν.
18 Θυσιάζων ἐξ ἀδίκου, προσφορὰ μεμωμημένη, καὶ οὐκ εἰς εὐδοκίαν μωμήματα ἀνόμων·
19 οὐκ εὐδοκεῖ ὁ ὕψιστος ἐν προσφοραῖς ἀσεβῶν, οὐδὲ ἐν πλήθει θυσιῶν ἐξιλάσκεται ἁμαρτίας.
20 Θύων υἱὸν ἔναντι τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ, ὁ προσάγων θυσίαν ἐκ χρημάτων πενήτων.
21 Ἄρτος ἐπιδεομένων ζωὴ πτωχῶν, ὁ ἀποστερῶν αὐτὴν ἄνθρωπος αἱμάτων·
22 φονεύων τὸν πλησίον ὁ ἀφαιρούμενος ἐμβίωσιν, καὶ ἐκχέων αἷμα ὁ ἀποστερῶν μισθὸν μισθίου.
23 Εἷς οἰκοδομῶν, καὶ εἷς καθαιρῶν, τί ὠφέλησαν πλεῖον ἢ κόπους;
24 Εἷς εὐχόμενος, καὶ εἷς καταρώμενος, τίνος φωνῆς εἰσακούσεται ὁ δεσπότης;
25 Βαπτιζόμενος ἀπὸ νεκροῦ καὶ πάλιν ἁπτόμενος αὐτοῦ, τί ὠφέλησεν ἐν τῷ λουτρῷ αὐτοῦ;
26 Οὕτως ἄνθρωπος νηστεύων ἐπὶ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάλιν πορευόμενος καὶ τὰ αὐτὰ ποιῶν, τῆς προσευχῆς αὐτοῦ τίς εἰσακούσεται; καὶ τί ὠφέλησεν ἐν τῷ ταπεινωθῆναι αὐτόν;

**KEΦ. ΛΒʹ. XXXII.**
1 Ὁ συντηρῶν νόμον πλεονάζει προσφοράς, θυσιάζων σωτηρίου ὁ προσέχων ἐντολαῖς·
2 ἀνταποδιδους χάριν προσφέρων σεμίδαλιν, καὶ ὁ ποιῶν ἐλεημοσύνην θυσιάζων αἰνέσεως.
3 Εὐδοκία κυρίου ἀποστῆναι ἀπὸ πονηρίας, καὶ ἐξιλασμὸς ἀποστῆναι ἀπὸ ἀδικίας.
4 Μὴ ὀφθῇς ἐν προσώπῳ Κυρίου κενός· πάντα γὰρ ταῦτα χάριν ἐντολῆς.
5 Προσφορὰ δικαίου λιπαίνει θυσιαστήριον, καὶ ἡ εὐωδία αὐτῆς ἔναντι ὑψίστου·
6 θυσία ἀνδρὸς δικαίου δεκτή, καὶ τὸ μνημόσυνον αὐτῆς οὐκ ἐπιλησθήσεται.
7 Ἐν ἀγαθῷ ὀφθαλμῷ δέξασον τὸν Κύριον, καὶ μὴ μακρύνῃς ἀπαρχὴν χειρῶν σου·
8 ἐν πάσῃ δόσει ἱλάρωσον τὸ πρόσωπόν σου, καὶ ἐν εὐφροσύνῃ ἀγίασον δεκάτην.
9 Δὸς ὑψίστῳ κατὰ τὴν δόσιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐν ἀγαθῷ ὀφθαλμῷ καθ᾿ εὕρεμα χειρός·
10 ὅτι Κύριος ἀνταποδιδοὺς ἐστι, καὶ ἑπταπλάσια ἀποδώσει σοί.

**Chapter Thirty-One**

13 their hope is upon Him that saveth them.
14 He that feareth the Lord shall not have many fears,
    neither shall he be timid, for He Himself is his hope.
15 Blessed is the soul of him that feareth the Lord;
    to whom doth he look? And who is his support?
16 The eyes of the Lord are upon them that love Him:
    a shield of might and a support of strength,
    a shelter from the burning heat and a shelter from the noontide,
    a safeguard from stumbling and help from falling.
17 He lifteth up the soul and enlighteneth the eyes,
    giving healing, life, and blessing.
18 He that sacrificeth from unjust gain, his offering is defiled;
    and the blemishes of the lawless are not for [God's] good pleasure.
19 The Most High taketh no pleasure in the offerings of the ungodly,
    neither is He propitiated for sins by the multitude of sacrifices.
20 He that slayeth a son before his father is he that bringeth an offering from the money of the poor.
21 The bread of them that are in need is the life of the poor;
    he that depriveth them of it is a man of blood.
22 He that taketh away a livelihood is a murderer of his neighbor;
    and he that depriveth a hireling of his wages is one that poureth out blood.
23 One building, and one tearing down,
    what have they gained save only toil?
24 One praying, and one cursing,
    whose voice shall the Master hear?
25 He that hath been cleansed from a dead body, and again toucheth it,
    what hath he gained by his washing?
26 Even so a man fasting for his sins,
    and again going forth and doing the same things,
    who shall hear his prayer?
    And what hath he gained by humbling himself?

**Chapter Thirty-Two**

1 He that keepeth the Law multiplieth offerings;
    he that giveth heed to the commandments sacrificeth a peace offering.
2 He that rendereth thanks offereth fine flour;
    and he that doeth alms sacrificeth a sacrifice of praise.
3 The good pleasure of the Lord is to depart from wickedness,
    and an atonement is to depart from unrighteousness.
4 Appear not empty-handed before the Lord;
    for all these things are by reason of the commandment.
5 The offering of the righteous maketh fat the altar,
    and the sweet savor thereof is before the Most High.
6 The sacrifice of a righteous man is acceptable,
    and the memorial thereof shall not be forgotten.
7 Receive the Lord with a generous eye,
    and delay not the firstfruits of thy hands.
8 In every gift make cheerful thy countenance,
    and with gladness sanctify thy tithe.
9 Give to the Most High according to His gift [to thee],
    and with a generous eye, according to what thy hand hath found;
10 for the Lord is a Requiter, and He shall repay thee sevenfold.
