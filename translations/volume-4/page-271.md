`4` λεχίζοντι εἰς κακά, καὶ τῷ ἐλεημοσύνην μὴ χαριζομένῳ. Δὸς τῷ
`5` εὐσεβεῖ, καὶ μὴ ἀντιλαμβάνου τοῦ ἁμαρτωλοῦ· εὐποίησον ταπεινῷ,
    καὶ μὴ δῶς ἀσεβεῖ· ἐμπόδισον τοὺς ἄρτους αὐτοῦ καὶ μὴ δῶς
    αὐτῷ, ἵνα μὴ ἐν αὐτοῖς σε δυναστεύσῃ· διπλάσια γὰρ κακὰ εὑρή-
`6` σει σε ἐν πᾶσιν ἀγαθοῖς οἷς ἐὰν ποιήσῃς αὐτῷ. Ὅτι καὶ ὁ ὕψιστος
    ἐμίσησεν ἁμαρτωλούς, καὶ τοῖς ἀσεβέσιν ἀποδώσει ἐκδίκησιν, φυ-
`7` λάξει δὲ αὐτοὺς εἰς ἡμέραν ἐκδικήσεως αὐτῶν κραταιάν. Δὸς τῷ
`8` ἀγαθῷ, καὶ μὴ ἀντιλάβου ἁμαρτωλοῦ. Οὐκ ἐμβληθήσεται ἐν ἀγαθοῖς
`9` ὁ φίλος, καὶ οὐ κρυβήσεται ἐν κακοῖς ὁ ἐχθρός. Ἐν ἀγαθοῖς ἀνδρὸς
    οἱ ἐχθροὶ αὐτοῦ ἐν λύπῃ, καὶ ἐν τοῖς κακοῖς αὐτοῦ καὶ ὁ φίλος δια-
`10` χωρισθήσεται. Μὴ πιστεύσῃς τῷ ἐχθρῷ σου εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα· ὡς γὰρ
`11` ὁ χαλκὸς ἰοῦται, οὕτως ἡ πονηρία αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐὰν ταπεινωθῇ καὶ
    πορεύηται συγκεκυφώς, ἐπίστησον τῇ ψυχῇ σου καὶ φύλαξαι ἀπ᾽
    αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔσῃ αὐτῷ ὡς ἐκμεμαχὼς ἔσοπτρον, καὶ γνώσῃ ὅτι οὐκ
`12` εἰς τέλος κατίωται. Μὴ στήσῃς αὐτὸν παρὰ σεαυτῷ, μὴ ἀνατρέψας
    σε στῇ ἐπὶ τὸν τόπον σου· μὴ καθίσῃς αὐτὸν ἐκ δεξιῶν σου,
    μήποτε ζητήσῃ τὴν καθέδραν σου, καὶ ἐπ᾽ ἐσχάτων ἐπιγνώσῃ τοὺς
`13` λόγους μου, καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν ῥημάτων μου κατανυγήσῃ. Τίς ἐλεήσει
`14` ἐπαοιδὸν ὀφίδηκτον, καὶ πάντας τοὺς προσάγοντας θηρίοις; Οὕ-
    τως τὸν προσπορευόμενον ἀνδρὶ ἁμαρτωλῷ, καὶ συμφυρόμενον ἐν
`15` ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις αὐτοῦ· ὥραν μετὰ σοῦ διαμενεῖ, καὶ ἐὰν ἐκκλίνῃς, οὐ
`16` μὴ καρτερήσῃ. Καὶ ἐν τοῖς χείλεσιν αὐτοῦ γλυκανεῖ ὁ ἐχθρός, καὶ ἐν
    τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ βουλεύσεται ἀνατρέψαι σε εἰς βόθρον· ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς
    αὐτοῦ δακρύσει ὁ ἐχθρός, καὶ ἐὰν εὕρῃ καιρὸν οὐκ ἐμπλησθήσεται
`17` ἀφ᾽ αἵματος· κακὰ ἐὰν ὑπαντήσῃ σοι, εὑρήσεις αὐτὸν ἐκεῖ πρότερόν
`18` σου, καὶ ὡς βοηθὸν ὑποσχέται πτέρναν σου· τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ
    κινήσει, καὶ ἐπικροτήσει ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτοῦ, καὶ πολλὰ διαφιθυρί-
    σει, καὶ ἀλλοιώσει τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ.

`1` Ὁ ἁπτόμενος πίσσης μολυνθήσεται, καὶ ὁ κοινωνῶν ὑπερη-

`4` that continueth in wickedness, and to him that granteth not mercy.
`5` Give unto the godly, and do thou not succor the sinner; do good unto the humble, and give not unto the ungodly. Hinder his bread, and give it not unto him, lest he oppress thee by means of them; for double evils shall he find for thee in all good things which thou shalt do unto him.
`6` For the Most High also hath hated sinners, and unto the ungodly will He render vengeance; but He shall keep them unto a day of their mighty vengeance.
`7` Give unto the good man, and succor thou not a sinner.
`8` The friend shall not be cast away in [his] good [fortune], and the enemy shall not be hidden in [thy] evils.
`9` In the good fortune of a man, his enemies are in sorrow; and in his evils, even the friend shall be separated.
`10` Believe not thy enemy forever; for as copper doth rust, so is his wickedness.
`11` And if he be humbled and walk bowing low, attend thou to thy soul and guard thyself from him; and thou shalt be unto him as one that hath wiped a mirror clean, and thou shalt know that he is not wholly cleansed.
`12` Place him not beside thyself, lest, having overthrown thee, he stand in thy place. Seat him not at thy right hand, lest he seek thy seat; and in the end thou shalt know my words, and by my sayings thou shalt be pricked in [thy] heart.
`13` Who shall pity a charmer bitten by a serpent, and all those who draw near to wild beasts?
`14` So is he that goeth near a sinful man, and mingleth himself in his sins.
`15` He shall abide with thee for an hour, and if thou shouldst stray, he shall not endure.
`16` And with his lips shall the enemy sweeten [his speech], but in his heart he shall counsel to overthrow thee into a pit. With his eyes shall the enemy weep, and if he find opportunity, he shall not be satisfied with blood.
`17` If evils should meet thee, thou shalt find him there before thee,
`18` and as a helper, he shall promise to trip up thy heel. He shall shake his head, and clap with his hands, and whisper many things, and alter his face.

**Chapter Thirteen**

`1` He that toucheth pitch shall be defiled, and he that hath fellowship with a proud man shall be made like unto him.
`2` Take not up a burden beyond thee, and with one stronger than thee and richer than thee, have no fellowship. What fellowship hath a pot with a kettle? The one shall strike against [the other], and the one shall be broken.
`3` A rich man hath done wrong, and he himself hath also been enraged; [but] a poor man hath been wronged, and
