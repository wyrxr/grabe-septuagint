**6** στρατηγόν. Καὶ προσήγγειλε περὶ τοῦ χρημάτων ἀμυθήτων γέ-
    μειν τὸ ἐν Ἱεροσολύμοις γαζοφυλάκιον, ὥστε τὸ πλῆθος τῶν
    διαφόρων ἀναρίθμητον εἶναι, καὶ μὴ προσήκειν αὐτὰ πρὸς τὸν
    τῶν θυσιῶν λόγον, εἶναι δὲ δυνατὸν ὑπὸ τοῦ βασιλέως ἐξουσίαν
    πεσεῖν ἅπαντα ταῦτα.
**7** Συμμίξας δὲ Ἀπολλώνιος τῷ βασιλεῖ,
    περὶ τῶν μηνυθέντων αὐτῷ χρημάτων ἐνεφάνισεν· ὁ δὲ προχειρι-
    σάμενος Ἡλιόδωρον τὸν ἐπὶ τῶν πραγμάτων, ἀπέστειλε δοὺς ἐν-
    τολάς, τὴν τῶν προειρημένων χρημάτων ἐκκομιδὴν ποιήσασθαι.
**8** Εὐθέως δὲ ὁ Ἡλιόδωρος ἐποιεῖτο τὴν πορείαν, τῇ μὲν ἐμφάσει
    ὡς τὰς κατὰ Κοίλην Συρίαν καὶ Φοινίκην πόλεις ἐφοδεῦσαι, τῷ
    πράγματι δὲ τὴν τοῦ βασιλέως πρόθεσιν ἐπιτελεῖν.
**9** Παραγενη-
    θεὶς δὲ εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα, καὶ φιλοφρόνως ὑπὸ τοῦ ἀρχιερέως τῆς πό-
    λεως ἀποδεχθείς, ἀνέθετο περὶ τοῦ γεγονότος ἐμφανισμοῦ, καί
    τίνος ἕνεκεν πάρεστι, διεσαφήνισεν· ἐπυνθάνετο δὲ εἰ ταῖς ἀλη-
    θείαις ταῦτα οὕτως ἔχοντα τυγχάνει.
**10** Τοῦ δὲ ἀρχιερέως ὑπο-
    δείξαντος παρακαταθήκας εἶναι χρημάτων τε καὶ ὀρφανῶν·
**11** Τινὰ δὲ
    καὶ Ὑρκανοῦ τοῦ Τωβίου σφόδρα ἀνδρὸς ἐν ὑπεροχῇ κειμένου
    οὐχ ὥσπερ διαβάλλων ὁ δυσσεβὴς Σίμων, τὰ δὲ πάντα ἀργυρίου
    τετρακόσια τάλαντα, χρυσίου δὲ διακόσια·
**12** Ἀδικηθῆναι τε τοὺς
    πεπιστευκότας τῇ τοῦ τόπου ἁγιωσύνῃ καὶ τῇ τοῦ τετιμημένου
    κατὰ τὸν σύμπαντα κόσμον ἱεροῦ σεμνότητι καὶ ἀσυλίᾳ, παν-
    τελῶς ἀμήχανον εἶναι.
**13** Ὁ δὲ Ἡλιόδωρος, δι’ ἃς εἶχε βασιλικὰς
    ἐντολάς, πάντως ἔλεγεν εἰς τὸ βασιλικὸν ἀναληπτέα ταῦτα εἶ-
    ναι.
**14** Ταξάμενος δὲ ἡμέραν εἰσῄει περὶ τούτων ἐπίσκεψιν οἰ-
    κονομήσων· ἦν δὲ οὐ μικρὰ καθ’ ὅλην τὴν πόλιν ἀγωνία.
**15** Οἱ δὲ
    ἱερεῖς πρὸ τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου ἐν ταῖς ἱερατικαῖς στολαῖς ῥίψαν-
    τες ἑαυτοὺς ἐπεκαλοῦντο εἰς οὐρανὸν τὸν περὶ παραθήκης νομο-
    θετήσαντα τοῖς παρακαταθεμένοις ταῦτα σῶα διαφυλάξαι.
**16** Ἦν
    δὲ ὁρῶντα τὴν τοῦ ἀρχιερέως ἰδέαν τιτρώσκεσθαι τὴν διάνοιαν·
**17** ἡ γὰρ ὄψις καὶ τὸ τῆς χρόας παρηλλαγμένον ἐνέφαινε τὴν κα-
    τὰ ψυχὴν ἀγωνίαν.
**18** Περιεκέχυτο γὰρ ἐπὶ τὸν ἄνδρα δέος τι
    καὶ φρικασμὸς σώματος, δι’ ὧν πρόδηλον ἐγίνετο τοῖς θεωροῦσι
    τὸ κατὰ καρδίαν ἐνεστὸς ἄλγος.
**19** Οἱ δὲ ἐκ τῶν οἰκιῶν ἀγεληδὸν
    ἐξεπήδων ἐπὶ πάνδημον ἱκετείαν, διὰ τὸ μὴ μέλλειν εἰς κατα-
    φρόνησιν ἔρχεσθαι τὸν τόπον.

#### CHAPTER III.

**6** unto the governor. And he did inform [him] that the treasury in Jerusalem was full of monies innumerable, so that the multitude of the various [deposits] was beyond reckoning; and that these did not pertain unto the account of the sacrifices, but that it was possible for all these things to fall under the king's authority.
**7** And Apollonius, having conferred with the king, made report concerning the monies which had been revealed unto him. And the king, having chosen Heliodorus, who was over the king's affairs, did send [him], giving commands to carry out the removal of the afore-mentioned monies.
**8** And straightway Heliodorus set forth upon his journey, under the pretext that he would visit the cities throughout Coele-Syria and Phoenicia, but in very deed, to execute the purpose of the king.
**9** Now when he was come unto Jerusalem, and had been kindly received by the high priest of the city, he did declare concerning the information which had been given, and did make plain for what cause he was present; and he inquired whether these things were in truth so.
**10** But when the high priest had made plain that these were deposits of monies, and [deposits pertaining unto] orphans,
**11** and moreover, some [funds] of Hyrcanus, the son of Tobias, a man of exceeding high standing – not as the impious Simon did slanderously report – and that the whole sum was four hundred talents of silver, and two hundred talents of gold.
**12** And that it was altogether impossible for those who had put their trust in the holiness of that place, and in the sanctity and inviolability of the Temple, which was honored throughout the whole world, to be wronged.
**13** But Heliodorus, by reason of the royal commands which he held, did declare that these things must needs be taken into the royal treasury.
**14** And having appointed a day, he made entrance to arrange an inquiry concerning these matters; and there was no small agony throughout the whole city.
**15** And the priests, arrayed in their sacerdotal vestments, cast themselves down before the altar, and did call upon Him in heaven, who had given the law concerning deposits, that He would preserve these [monies] safe for those who had entrusted them [to His keeping].
**16** And it was a sight to wound the mind, to behold the countenance of the high priest;
**17** for his mien and the altered hue of his complexion did betray the anguish of his soul.
**18** For a certain dread and trembling of body did encompass the man, whereby the anguish residing in his heart was made manifest to them that did behold [him].
**19** And the people, rushing forth from their houses in throngs, did hasten to a public supplication, lest the holy place should be brought into contempt.
