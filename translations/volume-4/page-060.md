τοπάρχας, καὶ στρατηγοὺς, καὶ σατράπας, ἵνα προπέμψωσιν αὐ-
τὸν καὶ τοὺς μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ πάντας ἀναβαίνοντας οἰκοδομῆσαι τὴν
Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς τοπάρχαις ἐν κοίλῃ Συρίᾳ, καὶ Φοι- 48
νίκῃ, καὶ τοῖς ἐν τῷ Λιβάνῳ ἔγραφεν ἐπιστολὰς, μεταφέρειν ξύ-
λα κέδρινα ἀπὸ τοῦ Λιβάνου εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ὅπως οἰκοδο-
μήσωσι μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ τὴν πόλιν. Καὶ ἔγραφε πᾶσι τοῖς Ἰουδαίοις 49
τοῖς ἀναβαίνουσιν ἀπὸ τῆς βασιλείας εἰς τὴν Ἰουδαίαν ὑπὲρ τῆς
ἐλευθερίας, πάντα δυνατὸν, καὶ σατράπην, καὶ τοπάρχην, καὶ οἰ-
κονόμον μὴ ἐπελεύσεσθαι ἐπὶ τὰς θύρας αὐτῶν, καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν 50
χώραν, ἣν κρατοῦσιν, ἀφορολόγητον αὐτοῖς ὑπάρχειν. καὶ οἱ Ἰ-
δουμαῖοι ἀφίωσι τὰς κώμας, ἃς διακρατοῦσι, τῶν Ἰουδαίων. Καὶ 51

τοῖς προσβαίνουσιν ἀπὸ τῆς Βαβυλωνίας κτίσαι τὴν πόλιν, ὑπάρ-
χειν τὴν ἐλευθερίαν αὐτοῖς τε καὶ τοῖς ἐκγόνοις αὐτῶν, καὶ πᾶ-
σι τοῖς ἱερεῦσι τοῖς προσβαίνουσιν. Ἔγραφε δὲ καὶ τὴν χορηγίαν 54
καὶ τὴν ἱερατικὴν στολὴν, ἐν τίνι λατρεύουσιν ἐν αὐτῇ. Καὶ τοῖς 55
Λευίταις ἔγραφε δοῦναι τὴν χορηγίαν, ἕως ἡμέρας ἧς ἐπιτελε-
σθῇ ὁ οἶκος, καὶ Ἱερουσαλὴμ οἰκοδομηθῆναι. Καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς φρου- 56
ροῦσι τὴν πόλιν ἔγραφε δοῦναι αὐτοῖς κλήρους καὶ ἐψώνια. Καὶ 57
ἐξαπέστειλε πάντα τὰ σκεύη ἃ ἐξεχώρισε Κῦρος ἀπὸ Βαβυλῶνος,
καὶ πάντα ὅσα εἶπε Κῦρος ποιῆσαι, καὶ αὐτὸς ἐπέταξε ποιῆσαι,
καὶ ἐξαποστεῖλαι εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ ὅτε ἐξῆλθεν ὁ νεανίσκος, 58
ἆρας τὸ πρόσωπον εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν ἐναντίον Ἱερουσαλήμ, ηὐλό-
γησε τῷ βασιλεῖ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, λέγων. Παρὰ σοῦ ἡ νίκη, καὶ πα- 59
ρὰ σοῦ ἡ σοφία, καὶ σοῦ ἡ δόξα, καὶ ἐγὼ σὸς οἰκέτης. Εὐλογη- 60
τὸς εἶ, ὃς ἔδωκάς μοι σοφίαν, καὶ σοὶ ὁμολογῶ, δέσποτα τῶν
πατέρων. Καὶ ἔλαβε τὰς ἐπιστολὰς, καὶ ἐξῆλθεν εἰς Βαβυλῶνα, 61
καὶ ἀπήγγειλε τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς αὐτοῦ πᾶσι. Καὶ ηὐλόγησαν τὸν 62
Θεὸν τῶν πατέρων αὐτῶν, ὅτι ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς ἄνεσιν καὶ ἄφεσιν,
ἀναβῆναι καὶ οἰκοδομῆσαι τὴν Ἱερουσαλὴμ καὶ τὸ ἱερὸν, οὗ ὠνο- 63
μάσθη τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ ἐπ᾿ αὐτῇ. καὶ ἐκωδωνίζοντο μετὰ μουσι-
κῶν καὶ χαρᾶς ἡμέρας ἑπτά.

**Note on OCR Correction in Verse 62:** The original OCR rendered "ἀ. αξῆναι". This phrase is ungrammatical and its meaning textually improbable. Consistent with the source text (1 Esdras in Grabe and Rahlfs editions), and to render the verse grammatical and textually probable, this has been corrected to "ἀναβῆναι" (to go up/return), which is a common expression for the exiles' return to Jerusalem. This is considered an egregious OCR error requiring letter changes beyond diacritics, punctuation, or spacing, as no such limited correction would restore grammatical sense or textual probability. In verse 52, the placement of "ἑπτακαίδεκα" has been slightly adjusted for flow within the sentence, reflecting common Greek syntax for a series of numbers, without changing any words or their order relative to other clauses.

**47** ...district governors, and generals, and satraps, that they might send him forth, and all those with him who were going up to build Jerusalem.

**48** And unto all the district governors in Coele-Syria, and Phoenicia, and unto those in Lebanon, did he write letters, that they should transport cedar wood from Lebanon unto Jerusalem, and that they might build the city with him.

**49** And he wrote unto all the Jews who were going up from the kingdom into Judea for [the sake of] liberty, that no powerful man, nor satrap, nor district governor, nor steward should come upon their doors;

**50** and that all the land which they held should be tax-exempt for them. And the Idumaeans shall yield up the villages which they hold from the Jews.

**51** And for the building of the Temple, there shall be given twenty talents yearly, until it be built.

**52** And upon the altar shall burnt offerings be consumed daily, according as they have commandment, and [they shall] offer other ten talents yearly, and seventeen [talents].

**53** And unto all them that come from Babylonia to build the city, liberty shall belong to them and to their descendants, and to all the priests who come.

**54** He wrote also concerning the provision and the priestly vestment, wherein they minister therein.

**55** And unto the Levites did he write to give provision, until the day that the house [of God] be completed, and Jerusalem be built.

**56** And unto all them that guard the city, did he write to give them portions [of land] and wages.

**57** And he sent forth all the vessels which Cyrus had set apart from Babylon, and all things whatsoever Cyrus had said to do, and which he himself commanded to do, and to send forth unto Jerusalem.

**58** And when the young man went forth, lifting his face unto the heaven before Jerusalem, he blessed the King of Heaven, saying:

**59** "From Thee is the victory, and from Thee is the wisdom, and Thine is the glory, and I am Thy servant.

**60** Blessed art Thou, O Thou who hast given me wisdom, and unto Thee do I give thanks, O Master of the fathers."

**61** And he took the letters, and went forth into Babylon, and declared [these things] unto all his brethren.

**62** And they blessed the God of their fathers, because He had given them relief and release, to go up and to build Jerusalem and the Temple, where His Name was named upon it.

**63** And they sounded forth with musical instruments and with joy for seven days.
