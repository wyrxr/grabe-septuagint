ΚΕΦ. Ε΄. V.

ΤΟΤΕ προσκαλεσάμενος Ἔρμωνα τὸν πρὸς τῇ τῶν ἐλεφάν- 1
των ἐπιμελείᾳ, βαρείᾳ μεμεστωμένος ὀργῇ καὶ χόλῳ κατὰ πᾶν
ἀμετάθετος, ἐκέλευσεν ὑπὸ τὴν ἐρχομένην ἡμέραν δαψιλέσι δρά- 2
κεσι λιβανωτοῦ καὶ οἴνῳ πλείονι ἀκράτῳ ἅπαντας τοὺς ἐλέφαν-
τας ποτίσαι, ὄντας τὸν ἀριθμὸν πεντακοσίους· καὶ ἀγριωθέντας
τῇ τοῦ πόματος ἀφθόνῳ χορηγίᾳ εἰσαγαγεῖν πρὸς συνάντησιν
τοῦ μόρου τῶν Ἰουδαίων. Ὁ μὲν τάδε προστάσσων ἐτρέπετο 3
πρὸς τὴν εὐωχίαν, συναγαγὼν τοὺς μάλιστα τῶν φίλων καὶ τῆς
στρατίας ἀπεχθῶς ἔχοντας πρὸς τοὺς Ἰουδαίους. Ὁ δὲ ἐλεφαν- 4
τάρχης τὸ προσαγὲν ἀραρότως Ἕρμων συνετελει. Οἵτε πρὸς τούτοις 5
λειτουργοὶ κατὰ τὴν ἑσπέραν ἐξιόντες τὰς τῶν ταλαιπωρούντων
ἐδέσμευον χεῖρας, τήν τε λοιπὴν ἐμηχανῶντο περὶ αὐτοὺς ἀσφά-
λειαν, ἔννυχον δέξαντες ὁμοῦ λήγεσθαι τὸ φῦλον πέρας τῆς ὀλε-
θρίας. Οἱ δὲ πάσης σκέπης ἔρημοι δοκοῦντες εἶναι τοῖς ἔθνε- 6
σιν Ἰουδαῖοι, διὰ τὴν πάντοθεν περιέχουσαν αὐτοὺς μετὰ δεσμῶν
ἀνάγκην, τὸν παντοκράτορα Κύριον καὶ πάσης δυνάμεως δυνα- 7
στεύοντα, ἐλεήμονα Θεὸν αὑτῶν καὶ πατέρα, δυσκαταπαύστῳ βοῇ
πάντες μετὰ δακρύων ἐπεκαλέσαντο δεόμενοι, τὴν κατ᾿ αὐτῶν 8
μεταστρέψαι βουλὴν ἀνοσίαν, καὶ ρύσασθαι αὐτοὺς μετὰ μεγα-
λομεροῦς ἐπιφανείας ἐκ τοῦ παρὰ πόδας ἐν ἑτοίμῳ μόρου. Τοῦ- 9
τον μὲν οὖν ἡ λιτανεία ἐκτενῶς ἀνέβαινεν εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν. Ὁ 10
δὲ Ἕρμων τοὺς ἀνηλεεῖς ἐλέφαντας ποτίσας πεπληρωμένους τῆς
τοῦ οἴνου πολλῆς χορηγίας καὶ τοῦ λιβάνου μεμεστωμένους, ἔρ-
θριος ἐπὶ τὴν αὔλην παρῆν περὶ τούτων προσαγγείλαι τῷ βα-
σιλεῖ. Τὸ δὲ ἀπ᾿ αἰῶνος κτίσμα χρόνου καλὸν ἐν νυκτὶ καὶ ἡμέ- 11
ρα ἐπιβαλλόμενον ὑπὸ τοῦ χαριζομένου πᾶσιν, οἷς ἂν αὐτὸς θελήσῃ,
ὕπνου μέρος ἀπέστειλε πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα. Καὶ ἡδίστῳ καὶ βαθεῖ 12
κατηχεῖσθη τῇ ἐνεργείᾳ τοῦ δεσπότου, τῆς ἀθέσμου μὲν προθέ-
σεως πολὺ διεσφαλμένος, τοῦ δὲ ἀμεταθέτου λογισμοῦ μεγάλως
διεψευσμένος. Οἱ δὲ Ἰουδαῖοι τὴν προσημανθεῖσαν ὥραν διαφυ- 13

**III Maccabees, Chapter 4**

**20** that the [supply of] papyrus and the writing reeds, wherewith they did write, had already failed.
**21** Now this was the operation of the invincible providence of Him that giveth succour to the Jews from heaven.

**III Maccabees, Chapter 5**

**1** Then, having called unto him Hermon, the overseer of the elephants, being filled with grievous wrath and altogether unyielding [in his purpose],
**2** he commanded that, on the morrow, all the elephants, being five hundred in number, should be given to drink of abundant portions of frankincense and of much undiluted wine; and that, being made savage by the plentiful ministration of the drink, they should be led forth to meet the ruin of the Jews.
**3** Now he that gave these commands did betake himself to a banquet, having gathered those among his friends and his army who bore the most enmity against the Jews.
**4** And Hermon, the master of the elephants, did precisely accomplish that which was enjoined upon him.
**5** And the officers appointed for these things, going forth at evening, did bind the hands of them that suffered; and they contrived the remaining security concerning them, deeming that in the night season the nation would altogether come to the uttermost end of perdition.
**6** But the Jews, who to the Gentiles seemed to be devoid of all protection, by reason of the necessity that encompassed them on every side with bonds,
**7** the Almighty Lord, and Ruler of all power, their merciful God and Father, did all with unceasing cry and with tears call upon, imploring,
**8** that He would turn away the unholy counsel against them, and deliver them with a magnificent epiphany from the destruction that was nigh at hand and ready to befall them.
**9** Therefore, this supplication did fervently ascend unto heaven.
**10** Now Hermon, having given drink unto the merciless elephants, which were filled with the plentiful provision of wine and heavy with frankincense, was present at the court early in the morning to make report of these matters unto the king.
**11** But that good creation of time from eternity, which is allotted both by night and by day by Him that graciously bestoweth upon all whomsoever He will, [even] a portion of sleep, did He send unto the king.
**12** And by the operation of the Lord, he was lulled into a sleep most sweet and deep, being greatly disappointed concerning his unlawful purpose, and marvellously deceived concerning his unalterable resolve.
**13** But the Jews, having escaped the hour that was fore-appointed, did hymn their holy God;
