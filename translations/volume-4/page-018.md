πως ἀπελθὼν περιστείλῃς τὸν νεκρόν, οὐκ ἔλαβές με ἀγαθοποιῶν,
ἀλλὰ σὺν σοὶ ἤμην. Καὶ νῦν ἀπέστειλέ με ὁ Θεὸς ἰάσασθαί σε 14
καὶ τὴν νύμφην σου Σάρραν. Ἐγὼ εἰμι ῾Ραφαὴλ, εἷς ἐκ τῶν ἑπτὰ 15
ἁγίων ἀγγέλων οἱ προσαναφέρουσι τὰς προσευχὰς τῶν ἁγίων,
καὶ εἰσπορεύονται ἐνώπιον τῆς δόξης τοῦ ἁγίου. Καὶ ἐταράχθη- 16
σαν οἱ δύο, καὶ ἔπεσαν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον, ὅτι ἐφοβήθησαν. Καὶ εἶπεν 17
αὐτοῖς· μὴ φοβεῖσθε, ὅτι εἰρήνη ἐσται ὑμῖν· τὸν δὲ Θεὸν εὐλο-
γεῖτε εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα· ὅτι οὐ τῇ ἐμαυτοῦ χάριτι, ἀλλὰ τῇ θελήσει 18
τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν ἦλθον· ὅθεν εὐλογεῖτε αὐτὸν εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα. Πά- 19
σας τὰς ἡμέρας ὡπτανόμην ὑμῖν, καὶ οὐκ ἔφαγον οὐδὲ ἔπιον, ἀλ-
λὰ ὅρασιν ὑμεῖς ἐθεωρεῖτε· καὶ νῦν ἐξομολογεῖσθε τῷ Θεῷ, διότι 20
ἀναβαίνω πρὸς τὸν ἀποστείλαντά με, καὶ γράψατε πάντα τὰ
συντελεσθέντα εἰς βιβλίον. Καὶ ἀνέστησαν, καὶ οὐκ ἔτι εἶδον αὐ- 21
τόν. Καὶ ἐξωμολογοῦντο τὰ ἔργα τὰ μεγάλα καὶ θαυμαστὰ τοῦ 23
Θεοῦ, καὶ ὡς ὤφθη αὐτοῖς ὁ ἄγγελος Κυρίου.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΓ΄. ΧΙΙΙ.

Καὶ Τωβὶτ ἔγραψε προσευχὴν εἰς ἀγαλλίασιν, καὶ εἶπεν· 1
εὐλογητὸς ὁ Θεὸς ὁ ζῶν εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας, καὶ ἡ βασιλεία αὐτοῦ·
ὅτι αὐτὸς μαστιγοῖ καὶ ἐλεεῖ, κατάγει εἰς ᾅδην καὶ ἀνάγει, καὶ 2
οὐκ ἔστιν ὃς ἐκφεύξεται τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ. Ἐξομολογεῖσθε αὐτῷ 3
οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐνώπιον τῶν ἐθνῶν, ὅτι αὐτὸς διέσπειρεν ἡμᾶς ἐν
αὐτοῖς. Ἐκεῖ ὑποδείξατε τὴν μεγαλωσύνην αὐτοῦ, ὑψοῦτε αὐτὸν 4
ἐνώπιον παντὸς ζῶντος, καθότι αὐτὸς Κύριος ἡμῶν, καὶ ὁ Θεὸς
ὁ πατὴρ ἡμῶν εἰς πάντας τοὺς αἰῶνας. Καὶ μαστιγώσει ἡμᾶς 5
ἐν ταῖς ἀδικίαις ἡμῶν, καὶ πάλιν ἐλεήσει καὶ συνάξει ἡμᾶς ἐκ
πάντων τῶν ἐθνῶν, οὗ ἐὰν ἐσκορπισθῆτε ἐν αὐτοῖς. Ἐὰν ἐπιστρέ- 6
ψητε πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐν ὅλῃ τῇ καρδίᾳ ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐν ὅλῃ τῇ ψυχῇ
ὑμῶν, ποιῆσαι ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ ἀλήθειαν, τότε ἐπιστρέψει πρὸς ὑ-
μᾶς, καὶ οὐ μὴ κρύψει τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἀφ᾿ ὑμῶν. καὶ θεά-
σασθε ἃ ποιήσει μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐξομολογήσασθε αὐτῷ ἐν ὅλῳ
τῷ στόματι ὑμῶν, καὶ εὐλογεῖτε τὸν Κύριον τῆς δικαιοσύνης,
καὶ ὑψώσατε τὸν βασιλέα τῶν αἰώνων. ἐγὼ ἐν τῇ γῇ τῆς αἰχμα-
λωσίας μου ἐξομολογοῦμαι αὐτῷ, καὶ δεικνύω τὴν ἰσχὺν καὶ τὴν
μεγαλωσύνην αὐτοῦ ἔθνει ἁμαρτωλῷ. ἐπιστρέψατε, ἁμαρτωλοὶ,

I, in the land of my captivity, give thanks unto Him, and show His might and His greatness to a sinful nation. Turn ye, O ye sinners,"
