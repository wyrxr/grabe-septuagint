καὶ οἱ ἐπίλοιποι τῆς βουλῆς αὐτῶν, καὶ κριταὶ οἱ ἐν κοίλῃ Συ-
17 ρίᾳ καὶ Φοινίκῃ· καὶ νῦν γνωστὸν ἔστω τῷ κυρίῳ μου βασιλεῖ,
διότι οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι ἀναβάντες παρ᾿ ὑμῶν πρὸς ἡμᾶς ἐλθόντες
εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ τὴν πόλιν τὴν ἀποστάτιν καὶ τὴν πονηράν, οἰ-
18 κοδομοῦσι τάς τε ἀγορὰς αὐτῆς, καὶ τὰ τείχη θεραπεύουσι, καὶ
ναὸν ὑποβάλλονται. Ἐὰν οὖν ἡ πόλις αὕτη οἰκοδομηθῇ, καὶ τὰ
τείχη συντελεσθῇ, φορολογίαν οὐ μὴ ὑπομείνωσι δοῦναι, ἀλλὰ
καὶ βασιλεῦσιν ἀντιστήσονται· καὶ ἐπεὶ ἐνεργεῖται τὰ κατὰ τὸν
ναόν, καλῶς ἔχειν ὑπολαμβάνομεν μὴ ὑπεριδεῖν τὸ τοιοῦτο, ἀλ-
19 λὰ προσφωνῆσαι τῷ κυρίῳ βασιλεῖ, ὅπως ἐὰν φάνηταί σοι, ἐπι-
σκεφθῇ ἐν τοῖς ἀπὸ τῶν πατέρων σου βιβλίοις. Καὶ εὑρήσεις ἐν τοῖς
ὑπομνήμασι τὰ γεγραμμένα περὶ τούτων, καὶ γνώσῃ ἔτι ἡ πό-
λις ἐκείνη ἦν ἀποστάτις, καὶ βασιλεῖς καὶ πόλεις ἐνοχλοῦσα,
καὶ οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι ἀποστάται καὶ πολιορκίας συνιστάμενοι ἐν αὐ-
20 τῇ ἔτι ἐξ αἰῶνος, δι᾿ ἣν αἰτίαν καὶ ἡ πόλις αὕτη ἠρημώθη. Νῦν
οὖν ὑποδείκνυμέν σοι, κύριε βασιλεῦ, διότι ἐὰν ἡ πόλις αὕτη οἰ-
κοδομηθῇ, καὶ τὰ ταύτης τείχη ἀνασταθῇ, κάθοδος οὐκ ἔτι
21 σοι ἔσται εἰς κοίλην Συρίαν καὶ Φοινίκην. Τότε ἀντέγραψεν
ὁ βασιλεὺς Ῥάθυμῳ τῷ γράφοντι τὰ προσπίπτοντα, καὶ Βεελ-
τέθμῳ, καὶ Σαμελλίῳ γραμματεῖ, καὶ τοῖς λοιποῖς τοῖς συντασ-
σομένοις καὶ οἰκοῦσιν ἐν τῇ Σαμαρείᾳ, καὶ Συρίᾳ, καὶ Φοινίκῃ,
22 τὰ ὑπογεγραμμένα. Ἀνέγνων τὴν ἐπιστολὴν ἣν πεπόμφατε πρός
μέ· ἐπέταξα οὖν ἐπισκέψασθαι· καὶ ηὑρέθη ὅτι ἐστὶν ἡ πόλις ἐκείνη
23 ἐξ αἰῶνος βασιλεῦσιν ἀντιπαρατάσσουσα. Καὶ οἱ ἄνθρωποι ἀποστά-
σεις καὶ πολέμους ἐν αὐτῇ συντελοῦντες, καὶ βασιλεῖς ἰσχυροὶ καὶ
σκληροὶ ἦσαν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ κυριεύοντες καὶ φορολογοῦντες κοίλην
24 Συρίαν καὶ Φοινίκην. Νῦν οὖν ἐπέταξα ἀποκωλῦσαι τοὺς ἀνθρώπους
ἐκείνους τοῦ οἰκοδομῆσαι τὴν πόλιν, καὶ προνοηθῆναι ὅπως μηδὲν
παρὰ ταῦτα γένηται, καὶ μὴ προβῇ ἐπὶ πλεῖον τὰ τῆς κακίας ἐπὶ
25 τῷ βασιλεῖς ἐνοχλεῖσθαι. Τότε ἀναγνωσθέντων τῷ παρὰ τοῦ
βασιλέως Ἀρταξέρξου γραφέντων, ὁ Ῥάθυμος, καὶ Σαμέλλιος
ὁ γραμματεύς, καὶ οἱ τούτοις συντασσόμενοι, ἀναζεύξαντες εἰς
Ἱερουσαλὴμ κατὰ σπουδὴν μεθ᾿ ἵππου καὶ ὄχλου παρατάξεως, ἤρ-
ξαντο κωλύειν τοὺς οἰκοδομοῦντας, καὶ ἤργει ἡ οἰκοδομὴ τοῦ ἱε-
ροῦ τοῦ ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ μέχρι τοῦ δευτέρου ἔτους τῆς βασιλείας
Δαρείου τοῦ Περσῶν βασιλέως.

**Chapter II.**

**16** and the rest of their council, and the judges who are in Coele Syria and Phoenicia:
**17** "Now therefore, let it be known unto my lord the king, that the Jews, who came up from among you, having come unto us into Jerusalem, that rebellious and wicked city,
**18** do build her markets and repair her walls, and lay the foundation for a temple. If therefore this city be built, and the walls thereof finished, they will by no means endure to pay tribute, but will also resist kings. And seeing that the matters concerning the temple are being carried out, we deem it good not to overlook such a thing,
**19** but to address our lord the king, that if it seem good unto thee, it may be searched in the books of thy fathers. And thou shalt find in the records the things written concerning these, and thou shalt know that that city was ever rebellious, and troublesome unto kings and cities; and the Jews were rebels and did continually stir up sieges therein from of old,
**20** for which cause also this city was laid waste. Now therefore we show unto thee, O lord the king, that if this city be built, and the walls thereof be raised, there shall no more be access for thee into Coele Syria and Phoenicia."
**21** Then the king wrote back unto Rathymus the Chancellor, and to Beeltethmus, and to Samellius the scribe, and to the rest who were associated with them and dwelt in Samaria, and Syria, and Phoenicia, the things written below:
**22** "I have read the letter which ye have sent unto me. Therefore I commanded to make search, and it was found that that city hath been rebellious against kings from of old.
**23** And the men did bring about rebellions and wars therein; and mighty and severe kings were in Jerusalem, ruling over and levying tribute from Coele Syria and Phoenicia.
**24** Now therefore I have commanded to hinder those men from building the city, and to provide that nothing further may be done contrary to these things, and that the matters of wickedness may not proceed further, to the troubling of kings."
**25** Then, when the things written by King Artaxerxes were read, Rathymus, and Samellius the scribe, and those associated with them, departed with haste unto Jerusalem, with horses and an arrayed multitude, and began to hinder them that built. And the building of the temple in Jerusalem ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius, the king of the Persians.
