**1** ΤΟΙΣ ἀδελφοῖς τοῖς κατ᾽ Αἴγυπτον Ἰουδαίοις χαίρειν· οἱ ἀδελφοὶ οἱ ἐν Ἱεροσολύμοις Ἰουδαῖοι καὶ οἱ ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ τῆς Ἰουδαίας εἰρήνην ἀγαθήν. Καὶ ἀγαθοποιήσαι ὑμῖν ὁ Θεός, καὶ μνησθείη τῆς διαθήκης αὐτοῦ τῆς πρὸς Ἀβραὰμ καὶ Ἰσαὰκ καὶ Ἰακὼβ τῶν δούλων αὐτοῦ τῶν πιστῶν. Καὶ δώῃ ὑμῖν καρδίαν πᾶσιν εἰς τὸ σέβεσθαι αὐτὸν καὶ ποιεῖν αὐτοῦ τὰ θελήματα καρδίᾳ μεγάλῃ καὶ ψυχῇ βουλομένῃ. Καὶ διανοίξαι τὴν καρδίαν ὑμῶν ἐν τῷ νόμῳ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐν τοῖς προστάγμασι, καὶ εἰρήνην ποιῆσαι.
**5** Καὶ ὑπακούσαι ὑμῶν τῶν δεήσεων, καὶ καταλλαγείη ὑμῖν, καὶ
**6** μὴ ὑμᾶς ἐγκαταλίποι ἐν καιρῷ πονηρῷ. Καὶ νῦν ὧδε ἔσμεν προσευχόμενοι περὶ ὑμῶν.
**7** Βασιλεύοντος Δημητρίου ἔτους ἑκατοστοῦ ἑξηκοστοῦ ἐνάτου, ἡμεῖς οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι γεγράφαμεν ὑμῖν ἐν τῇ θλίψει καὶ ἐν τῇ ἀκμῇ τῇ ἐπελθούσῃ ἡμῖν ἐν τοῖς ἔτεσι τούτοις, ἀφ᾽ οὗ ἀπέστη Ἰάσων καὶ οἱ μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τῆς ἁγίας γῆς καὶ τῆς βασιλείας.
**8** Καὶ ἐνεπύρισαν τὸν πυλῶνα, καὶ ἐξέχεαν αἷμα ἀθῶον· καὶ ἐδεήθημεν τοῦ Κυρίου καὶ εἰσηκούσθημεν, προσηνέγκαμεν θυσίαν καὶ σεμίδαλιν, καὶ ἐξήψαμεν τοὺς λύχνους, καὶ προεθήκαμεν τοὺς ἄρτους.
**9** Καὶ νῦν ἵνα ἄγητε τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς σκηνοπηγίας τοῦ Χασελεῦ μηνός.
**10** Ἔτους ἑκατοστοῦ ὀγδοηκοστοῦ καὶ ὀγδόου οἱ ἐν Ἱεροσολύμοις καὶ οἱ ἐν τῇ Ἰουδαίᾳ, καὶ ἡ γερουσία καὶ Ἰούδας Ἀριστοβούλῳ διδασκάλῳ Πτολεμαίου τοῦ βασιλέως, ὄντι δὲ ἀπὸ τοῦ τῶν χριστῶν ἱερέων γένους καὶ τοῖς ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ Ἰουδαίοις, χαίρειν καὶ ὑγιαίνειν.
**11** Ἐκ μεγάλων κινδύνων ὑπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ σεσωσμένοι, μεγάλως εὐχαριστοῦμεν αὐτῷ, ὡς ἂν πρὸς βασιλέα παρατασσόμενοι.
**12** Αὐτὸς γὰρ ἐξέβρασε τοὺς παρατασσομένους ἐν τῇ ἁγίᾳ πόλει.

**9** And now, [we exhort you] that ye keep the days of the Feast of Tabernacles of the month Chislev.
