τῆς, καὶ ἐνέπρησεν αὐτὴν ἐν πυρί. Ἐκεῖθεν ἀπῆρε, καὶ προκα- 36
τελάβετο τὴν Χασφὼθ, Μακὲδ, Βοσὸρ, καὶ τὰς λοιπὰς πόλεις
τῆς Γαλαδίτιδος. Μετὰ δὲ τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα συνήγαγε Τιμό- 37
θεος παρεμβολὴν ἄλλην, καὶ παρενέβαλε κατὰ πρόσωπον Ῥαφὼν
ἐκ πέραν τοῦ χειμάῤῥου. Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ἰούδας κατασκοπῆσαι 38
τὴν παρεμβολὴν καὶ ἀπήγγειλαν αὐτῷ, λέγοντες· ἐπισυνηγμένοι
εἰσὶ πρὸς αὐτοὺς πάντα τὰ ἔθνη τὰ κύκλῳ ὑμῶν, δύναμις πολλὴ
σφόδρα. Καὶ Ἄραβες μεμίσθωται εἰς βοήθειαν αὐτοῖς, καὶ πα- 39
ρενέβαλον πέραν τοῦ χειμάῤῥου ἕτοιμοι τοῦ ἐλθεῖν ἐπὶ σὲ εἰς πό-
λεμον· καὶ ἐπορεύθη Ἰούδας εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτῶν. Καὶ εἶπε 40
Τιμόθεος τοῖς ἄρχουσι τῆς δυνάμεως αὐτοῦ, ἐν τῷ ἐγγίζειν Ἰού-
δαν καὶ τὴν παρεμβολὴν αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὸν χειμάῤῥουν τοῦ ὕδατος·
Ἐὰν διαβῇ πρὸς ἡμᾶς πρότερος, οὐ δυνησόμεθα ὑποστῆναι αὐτὸν,
ἔτι δυνάμενος δυνήσεται πρὸς ἡμᾶς. Ἐὰν δὲ δειλωθῇ καὶ παρεμβάλῃ 41
πέραν τοῦ ποταμοῦ, διαπεράσομεν πρὸς αὐτὸν, καὶ δυνησόμεθα
πρὸς αὐτόν. Ὡς δὲ ἤγγισεν Ἰούδας ἐπὶ τὸν χειμάῤῥουν τοῦ ὕ- 42
δατος, ἔστησε τοὺς γραμματεῖς τοῦ λαοῦ ἐπὶ τοῦ χειμάῤῥου, καὶ
ἐνετείλατο αὐτοῖς, λέγων· μὴ ἀφῆτε πάντα ἄνθρωπον παρεμβα-
λεῖν, ἀλλὰ ἐρχέσθωσαν πάντες εἰς τὸν πόλεμον. Καὶ διεπέρασε 43
πρὸς αὐτοὺς πρότερον, καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς αὐτοῦ ὄπισθεν αὐτοῦ· καὶ
συνετρίβησαν πρὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη καὶ ἐῤῥίψαν
πάντα τὰ ὅπλα αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔφυγον εἰς τὸ τέμενος ἐν Καρναΐν.
Καὶ προκατελάβοντο τὴν πόλιν, καὶ τὸ τέμενος ἐνεπύρισαν ἐν 44
πυρὶ σὺν πᾶσι τοῖς οὖσιν ἐν αὐτῷ· καὶ ἐτροπώθη ἡ Καρναΐν, καὶ
οὐκ ἐδύνατο ἔτι ὑποστῆναι κατὰ πρόσωπον Ἰούδα. Καὶ συνήγα- 45
γεν Ἰούδας πάντα Ἰσραὴλ τοὺς ἐν τῇ Γαλαδίτιδι ἀπὸ μικροῦ
ἕως μεγάλου καὶ τὰς γυναῖκας αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰ τέκνα αὐτῶν καὶ
τὴν ἀποσκευὴν, παρεμβολὴν μεγάλην σφόδρα, ἐλθεῖν εἰς γῆν Ἰού-
δα. Καὶ ἦλθον ἕως Ἐφρὼν, καὶ αὕτη ἡ πόλις μεγάλη ἐπὶ τῆς 46
εἰσόδου ἰσχυρὰ σφόδρα· οὐκ ἦν ἐκκλῖναι ἀπ᾽ αὐτῆς δεξιὰν ἢ ἀρι-
στεράν, ἀλλ᾽ ἢ διὰ μέσου αὐτῆς πορεύεσθαι. Καὶ ἀπέκλεισαν αὐ- 47
τοὺς οἱ ἐκ τῆς πόλεως, καὶ ἐνέφραξαν τὰς πύλας λίθοις. Καὶ ἀ- 48
πέστειλε πρὸς αὐτοὺς Ἰούδας λόγοις εἰρηνικοῖς, λέγων· διελεύ-
σομαι εἰς τὴν γῆν σου, τοῦ ἀπελθεῖν εἰς τὴν γῆν ἡμῶν, καὶ οὐ-
δεὶς κακοποιήσει ὑμᾶς, πλὴν τοῖς ποσὶ παρελευσόμεθα· καὶ οὐκ
ἠβούλοντο ἀνοῖξαι αὐτῷ. Καὶ ἐπέταξεν Ἰούδας κηρῦξαι ἐν τῇ 49

**39** And Arabs have been hired for their aid, and they have encamped beyond the brook, ready to come against thee to battle." And Judas went forth to meet them.
**40** And Timotheus said unto the captains of his host, when Judas and his army drew near unto the brook of water, "If he shall cross over unto us first, we shall not be able to withstand him; for he, being yet mighty, shall prevail against us.
**41** But if he shall turn faint of heart, and encamp beyond the river, we will cross over unto him, and we shall prevail against him."
**42** Now when Judas drew near unto the brook of water, he stationed the scribes of the people beside the brook, and commanded them, saying, "Suffer ye no man to make encampment, but let all come forth to the battle."
**43** And he crossed over unto them first, and all his people after him; and all the nations were shattered before his face, and they cast away all their weapons, and fled into the sanctuary in Carnaim.

**47** And those of the city shut them out, and blocked up the gates with stones.
**48** And Judas sent unto them with words of peace, saying, "We will pass through your land, to go into our own land, and no man shall do you harm, save that we shall pass by on foot." But they would not open [the gates] unto him.
