**ΚΕΦ. Α΄. Β΄. ΣΟΦΙΑ ΣΟΛΟΜΩΝΤΟΣ.**
οὐδὲ ᾄδου βασίλειον ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς. Δικαιοσύνη γὰρ ἀθάνατός ἐστιν· 15
ἀσεβεῖς δὲ ταῖς χερσὶ καὶ τοῖς λόγοις προσεκαλέσαντο αὐτόν· 16
φίλον ἡγησάμενοι αὐτὸν ἐτάκησαν, καὶ συνθήκην ἔθεντο πρὸς αὐτόν,
ὅτι ἄξιοί εἰσι τῆς ἐκείνου μερίδος εἶναι.

**ΚΕΦ. Β΄. ΙΙ.**

ΕΙΠΟΝ γὰρ ἐν ἑαυτοῖς λογισάμενοι οὐκ ὀρθῶς· ὀλίγος ἐστὶ 1
καὶ λυπηρὸς ὁ βίος ἡμῶν, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἴασις ἐν τελευτῇ ἀνθρώπου,
καὶ οὐκ ἐγνώσθη δ᾽ ἀναλύσας ἐξ ᾄδου. Ὅτι αὐτοσχεδίως 2
ἐγεννήθημεν, καὶ μετὰ τοῦτο ἐσόμεθα ὡς οὐχ ὑπάρξαντες· ὅτι
καπνὸς ἡ πνοὴ ἐν ῥισὶν ἡμῶν, καὶ ὁ λόγος σπινθὴρ ἐν κινήσει
καρδίας ἡμῶν· οὗ σβεσθέντος, τέφρα ἀποβήσεται τὸ σῶμα, καὶ 3
τὸ πνεῦμα διαχυθήσεται ὡς χαῦνος ἀὴρ· καὶ τὸ ὄνομα ἡμῶν 4
ἐπιλησθήσεται ἐν χρόνῳ, καὶ οὐδεὶς μνημονεύσει τῶν ἔργων ἡμῶν·
καὶ παρελεύσεται ὁ βίος ἡμῶν ὡς ἴχνη νεφέλης, καὶ ὡς ὁμίχλη
διασκεδασθήσεται διωχθεῖσα ὑπὸ ἀκτίνων ἡλίου, καὶ ὑπὸ θερμότητος
αὐτοῦ βαρυνθεῖσα. Σκιὰς γὰρ πάροδος ὁ βίος ἡμῶν, 5
καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἀναποδισμὸς τῆς τελευτῆς ἡμῶν· ὅτι κατεσφραγίσθη,
καὶ οὐδεὶς ἀναστρέφει. Δεῦτε οὖν, ἀπολαύσωμεν τῶν 6
ὄντων ἀγαθῶν, καὶ χρησώμεθα τῇ κτίσει ὡς νεότητος σπουδαίως·
οἴνου πολυτελοῦς καὶ μύρων πλησθῶμεν, καὶ μὴ παροδευσάτω 7
ἡμᾶς ἄνθος ἔαρος· στεψώμεθα ῥόδων κώλυξι πρὶν μαρανθῆναι· 8
μηδεὶς ἡμῶν ἄμοιρος ἔστω τῆς ἡμετέρας ἀγερωχίας, πανταχῇ 9
καταλίπωμεν σύμβολα τῆς εὐφροσύνης, ὅτι αὕτη ἡ μερὶς ἡμῶν
καὶ ὁ κλῆρος ἡμῶν. Καταδυναστεύσωμεν πένητα δίκαιον, μὴ 10
φεισώμεθα χήρας, μηδὲ πρεσβυτέρου ἐντραπῶμεν πολιὰς πολυχρονίους·
ἔστω δὲ ἡμῶν ἡ ἰσχὺς νόμος τῆς δικαιοσύνης (τὸ γὰρ ἀσθενὲς 11
ἄχρηστον ἐλέγχεται·) ἐνεδρεύσωμεν τὸν δίκαιον, ἔτι δύσχρηστος 12
ἡμῖν ἐστι, καὶ ἐναντιοῦται τοῖς ἔργοις ἡμῶν, καὶ ὀνειδίζει
ἡμῖν ἁμαρτήματα νόμου, καὶ ἐπιφημίζει ἡμῖν ἁμαρτήματα παιδείας
ἡμῶν· ἐπαγγέλλεται γνῶσιν ἔχειν Θεοῦ, καὶ παῖδα Κυρίου 13
ἑαυτὸν ὀνομάζει· ἐγένετο ἡμῖν εἰς ἔλεγχον ἐννοιῶν ἡμῶν· βαρὺς 14
ἐστιν ἡμῖν καὶ βλεπόμενος, ὅτι ἀνόμοιος τοῖς ἄλλοις ὁ βίος αὐτοῦ, 15
καὶ ἐξηλλαγμέναι αἱ τρίβοι αὐτοῦ· εἰς κίβδηλον ἐλογίσθημεν 16
αὐτῷ, καὶ ἀπέχεται τῶν ὁδῶν ἡμῶν ὡς ἀπὸ ἀκαθαρσιῶν· μα-

**The Wisdom of Solomon.**

**CHAPTER I.**

**14** ...nor is Hades’ kingdom upon the earth.
**15** For righteousness is immortal.
**16** But the ungodly did call him unto themselves by their hands and by their words; having reckoned him as a friend, they wasted away, and made a covenant with him, that they are worthy to be of his portion.

**CHAPTER II.**

**1** For they said within themselves, reasoning not aright: “Short and sorrowful is our life, and there is no healing in the end of man, nor was there ever known any that hath returned from Hades.
**2** For we were born by chance, and after this shall we be as though we had not been; for the breath in our nostrils is but smoke, and reason is a spark kindled by the beating of our heart.
**3** Which when it is extinguished, the body shall turn to ashes, and the spirit shall be dispersed as thin air.
**4** And our name shall be forgotten in time, and no man shall remember our works; and our life shall pass away as the traces of a cloud, and shall be scattered as a mist which is driven away by the rays of the sun, and by the heat thereof made heavy.
**5** For our life is but the passing of a shadow, and there is no turning back of our end; for it hath been sealed, and no man returneth.
**6** Come then, let us enjoy the good things that are present, and let us use the creation with eagerness, as in the time of youth;
**7** Let us be filled with costly wine and ointments, and let no flower of the spring pass us by;
**8** Let us crown ourselves with rosebuds before they be withered;
**9** Let none among us be without his share of our arrogant revelry; let us leave everywhere tokens of our mirth, for this is our portion, and this our lot.
**10** Let us oppress the righteous poor; let us not spare the widow, nor be ashamed of the many years of the elder’s grey hairs;
**11** But let our strength be the law of righteousness (for that which is weak is found to be unprofitable;).
**12** Let us lay wait for the righteous; for he is yet troublesome unto us, and is contrary to our works, and upbraideth us with sins against the Law, and doth charge us with sins against our own upbringing.
**13** He professeth to have the knowledge of God, and calleth himself the servant of the Lord.
**14** He is made a reproof unto us of our very thoughts; he is grievous unto us even to behold,
**15** Because his life is unlike that of other men, and his ways are estranged.
**16** We are accounted by him as counterfeit; and he abstaineth from our ways as from impurities; moreover,
