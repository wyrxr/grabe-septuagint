14 αὐτῶν· ἐπεὶ ἀπεχθῶς προσεδέχοντο, τοὺς ἀλλοτρίους, οἳ δὲ μετὰ
15 ἑορτασμάτων εἰσδεξάμενοι, τοὺς ἤδη τῶν αὐτῶν μετεσχηκότας
δικαίων δεινοῖς ἐκάκωσαν πόνοις.
16 Ἐπλήγησαν δὲ καὶ ἀορασίᾳ, ὥσπερ ἐκεῖνοι ἐπὶ ταῖς τοῦ δικαίου θύραις, ὅτε ἀχανεῖ περιβληθέντες σκότει, ἕκαστος τῶν ἑαυτοῦ θυρῶν τὴν δίοδον ἐζήτει.
17 Δι᾽ ἑαυτῶν γὰρ τὰ στοιχεῖα μεθαρμοζόμενα, ὥσπερ ἐν ψαλτηρίῳ φθόγγοι τοῦ ῥυθμοῦ τὸ ὄνομα διαλλάσσουσι, πάντοτε μένοντα ἐν ἠχω· ὅπερ ἐστὶν εἰκάσαι ἐκ τῆς τῶν γεγονότων ἕξεως ἀκριβῶς.
18 Χερσαῖα γὰρ εἰς ἔνυδρα μετεβάλλετο, καὶ νηκτὰ μετέθαινεν ἐπὶ γῆς·
19 πῦρ ἴσχυεν ἐν ὕδατι τῆς ἰδίας δυνάμεως ἐπιλελησμένον, καὶ ὕδωρ τῆς σβεστικῆς φύσεως ἐπελανθάνετο·
20 φλόγες ἀνάπαλιν εὐφθάρτων ζώων οὐκ ἐμάραναν σάρκας ἐμπεριπατούντων, οὐδ᾽ ἔτηκον κρυσταλλοειδὲς εὔπηκτον γένος ἀμβροσίας τροφῆς.
21 Κατὰ πάντα γὰρ Κύριε ἐμεγάλυνας τὸν λαόν σου καὶ ἐδόξασας, καὶ οὐχ ὑπερεῖδες, ἐν παντὶ καιρῷ καὶ τόπῳ παριστάμενος.

**CHAPTER XIX.**

**14** unto them; for whereas some did receive strangers with hatred,
**15** yet these [Egyptians], after having received with feasts those who had already partaken of their own rights, did afflict [them] with grievous labours.
**16** And they were smitten also with blindness, even as those [Sodomites] at the doors of the righteous man, when, being encompassed with vast darkness, each one did seek the passage of his own doors.
**17** For by themselves the elements, being [re]tuned, even as the notes in a psaltery do change the name of the rhythm, yet ever abide in harmony; which thing it is possible to discern precisely from the nature of the things that have come to pass.
**18** For dry [land] was changed into watery [forms], and swimming [creatures] did traverse upon the earth;
**19** fire did prevail in water, having forgotten its own power, and water did forget its nature of quenching;
**20** conversely, flames did not wither the flesh of frail living things that did move among them, nor did they melt the crystalline, easily-congealed kind of ambrosial food.
**21** For in all things, O Lord, didst Thou magnify Thy people and didst glorify [them], and didst not overlook [them], being present in every time and place.
