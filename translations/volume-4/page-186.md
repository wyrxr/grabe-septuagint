ἐνέργεια τοῦ πάντα δεσποτεύοντος Θεοῦ, τῶν πρὶν αὐτῷ μεμηχα-
νημένων λῆθην κατὰ διάνοιαν ἐντεθεικότος. Ὁ δὲ Ἕρμων ὑπε-
δείκνυε· καὶ πάντες οἱ φίλοι, τὰ θηρία καὶ τὰς δυνάμεις ἑτοίμα-
σται, βασιλεύ, κατὰ τὴν σὴν ἐκτενῆ πρόθεσιν. Ὁ δὲ ἐπὶ τοῖς
θηρίοις πληρωθεὶς βραχεῖ χόλῳ, διὰ τὸ περὶ τούτων προνοίᾳ Θεοῦ
διεσκεδάσθαι πᾶν αὐτοῦ νόημα, ἐνατενίσας μετὰ ἀπειλῆς εἶπεν.
Εἰ σοὶ γονεῖς παρῆσαν ἢ παίδων γόνοι, τήνδε θηρσὶν ἀγρίαις
ἐσκεύασαν ἂν δαψιλῆ θοίναν ἀντὶ τῶν ἀνεγκλήτων ἐμοὶ καὶ προ-
γόνοις ἐμοῖς ἀποδεδειγμένων ὁλοσχερῆ βεβαίαν πίστιν ἐξό-
χως Ἰουδαίων. Καὶ περ εἰ μὴ διὰ τὴν τῆς συντροφίας στορ-
γὴν καὶ τῆς χρείας, τὸ ζῆν ἀντὶ τούτων ἐστερήθης. Οὕ-
τως ὁ Ἕρμων, ἀπροσδόκητον καὶ ἐπικίνδυνον ὑπήνεγκεν ἀπει-
λὴν καὶ τῇ δράσει καὶ τῷ προσώπῳ συνεστάλη. Ὁ καθεὶς δὲ
τῶν φίλων σκυθρωπῶς ὑπεκρέων, τοὺς συνηθροισμένους ἀπέλυσαν
ἕκαστον ἐπὶ τὴν ἰδίαν ἀσχολίαν. Οἵ τε Ἰουδαῖοι τὰ παρὰ τοῦ
βασιλέως ἀκούσαντες, τὸν ἐπιφανῆ Θεὸν καὶ βασιλέα τῶν βα-
σιλευόντων ἤνουν, καὶ τῆσδε τῆς βοηθείας αὐτοῦ πετευχύτες.
Κατὰ δὲ τοὺς αὐτοὺς νόμους ὁ βασιλεὺς συστησάμενος πάλιν
τὸ συμπόσιον, εἰς εὐφροσύνην τραπῆναι παρεκάλει. Τὸν δὲ Ἕρ-
μωνα προσκαλεσάμενος μετὰ ἀπειλῆς εἶπε· ποσάκις δὲ δεῖ σοι
περὶ τούτων αὐτῶν προστάττειν, ἀθλιώτατε ; Τοὺς ἐλέφαντας
ἔτι καὶ νῦν καθόπλισον εἰς τὴν αὔριον ἐπὶ τὸν τῶν Ἰουδαίων
ἀφανισμόν. Οἱ δὲ συνανακείμενοι συγγενεῖς τὴν ἀσταθῆ διάνοιαν
αὐτοῦ θαυμάζοντες, προσεφέροντο τάδε. Βασιλεύ, μέχρι τίνος
ὡς ἀλόγους ἡμᾶς διαπειράζεις, προστάσσων ἤδη τρίτον αὐτοὺς ἀ-
φανίσαι, καὶ πάλιν ἐπὶ τῶν πραγμάτων ἐκ μεταβολῆς ἀναλύων
τὰ σοὶ δεδογμένα; Ὧν χάριν ἡ πόλις διὰ τὴν προσδοκίαν ὀχλεῖ-
ται καὶ πληθύουσα συστροφαῖς ἤδη κινδυνεύει πολλάκις διαρπα-
σθῆναι. Ὅθεν ὁ κατὰ πάντα Φάλαρις βασιλεὺς ἐμπλησθεὶς
ἀλογιστίας, καὶ τὰς γινομένας πρὸς ἐπισκοπὴν τῶν Ἰουδαίων ἐν
αὐτῷ μεταβολὰς τῆς ψυχῆς παρ’ οὐδὲν ἡγούμενος, ἀτελέστατον
ἐθεώρησεν ἔργον, ὁρισάμενος τούτους μὲν ἀνυπερθέτως πέμψειν
εἰς ᾅδην ἐν γόνασι καὶ ποσὶ θηρίων ἡκισμένους, ἐπιστρατεῦσαι
δὲ ἐπὶ τὴν Ἰουδαίαν, ἰσόπεδον πυρὶ καὶ δόρατι θήσεσθαι διατά-
χους, καὶ τὸν ἄβατον ἡμῖν αὐτῶν ναὸν πυρὶ πρηνέα ἐν τάχει,
καὶ τῶν συντελούντων ἐκεῖ θυσίαν ἔρημον εἰς τὸν ἅπαντα χρό-
νων καταστήσειν. Τότε περιχαρείς ἀναλύσαντες οἱ φίλοι καὶ συγ-
γενεῖς μετὰ πίστεως, διέτασσον τὰς δυνάμεις ἐπὶ τοὺς εὐκαιρο-
τάτους τόπους τῆς πόλεως πρὸς τὴν τήρησιν. Ὁ δὲ ἐλεφαν-
τάρχης τὰ θηρία σχεδὸν, ὡς εἰπεῖν, εἰς κατάστημα μανιῶδες
ἀγχώσας, εὐωδεστάτοις πόμασιν οἴνου λελιβανωμένου φοβερῶς
κεκοσμημένα κατασκευαῖς, περὶ τὴν ἕω, τῆς πόλεως ἤδη πλήθε-
σιν ἀναριθμήτοις κατὰ τοῦ ἱπποδρόμου καταμεμεστωμένης, εἰσελ-
θὼν εἰς τὴν αὐλὴν ἐπὶ τὸ προκείμενον ὤτρυνε τὸν βασιλέα. Ὁ
δὲ ὀργῇ βαρεῖᾳ γεμίσας δυσσεβῆ φρένα, παντὶ τῷ βάρει σὺν τοῖς
θηρίοις ἐξώρμησε, βουλόμενος ἀτρέπτῳ καρδίᾳ καὶ κόραις ὀφθαλ-
μῶν θεάσασθαι τὴν ἐπίπονον καὶ ταλαίπωρον τῶν προσεσημαμ-
μένων καταστροφήν. Ὡς δὲ τῶν ἐλεφάντων ἐξιόντων περὶ πύλην,
καὶ τῆς ἑπομένης ἐνόπλου δυνάμεως, τῆς τε τοῦ πλήθους πορείας
κονιστὸν ἰδόντες, καὶ βαρυηχῆ θόρυβον ἀκούσαντες οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι,
ὑστάτην βίου ῥοπὴν αὐτοῖς ἐκείνην δόξαντες εἶναι τὸ τέλος τῆς
ἀθλιωτάτης προσδοκίας, εἰς οἶκτον καὶ γόους τραπέντες, κα-
τεφίλουν ἀλλήλους, περιπλεκόμενοι τοῖς συγγενέσιν, ἐπὶ τοὺς τρα-
χήλους ἐπιπίπτοντες, γονεῖς παισὶ καὶ μητέρες νεάνισιν· ἕτεραι
δὲ νεογνὰ πρὸς μαστοὺς ἔχουσαι βρέφη τελευταῖον ἕλκοντα γάλα.
Οὐ μὴν δὲ ἀλλὰ καὶ τὰς ἔμπροσθεν αὐτῶν γεγενημένας ἀντιλή-
ψεις ἐξ οὐρανοῦ συνιδόντες, πρηνεῖς ὁμοθυμαδὸν ῥίψαντες ἑαυτούς,
καὶ τὰ νήπια χωρίσαντες τῶν μαστῶν, ἀνεβόησαν φωνῇ μεγάλῃ
σφόδρα, τὸν τῆς ἁπάσης δυνάστην ἱκετεύοντες, οἰκτεῖραι μετὰ
ἐπιφανείας αὐτοὺς ἤδη πρὸς πύλαις ᾅδου καθεστῶτας.

**III Maccabees, Chapter 5**

**28** Now this was the operation of God, Who ruleth over all things, having placed forgetfulness in his mind concerning those things which had been plotted by him before.
**29** And Hermon did then make manifest [the matter]; and all the friends [did say], "O King, the beasts and the forces are made ready according to thy fervent purpose."
**30** But he, being filled with a brief wrath concerning the beasts – for that by the providence of God every thought of his concerning these matters had been scattered – looking intently with a threat, did say:
**31** "Hadst thou parents present or the fruit of thy loins, these would they have made a plenteous feast for wild beasts, in place of the Jews, who have shown a steadfast and blameless loyalty, full and complete, unto me and unto my forefathers.
**32** And wert thou not, by reason of the affection of our comradeship and the bond of need, thou shouldest have been deprived of thy life in their stead."
**33** Thus did Hermon endure a threat both unexpected and perilous, and was straitened both in his bearing and in his countenance.
**34** And each one of the friends, having cast down his gaze gloomily, did depart, and they dismissed all those who had been gathered, each man to his own occupation.
**35** And the Jews, having heard that which came forth from the king, did praise the manifest God, even the King of kings, for they had obtained this aid from Him.
**36** But the king, according to the same customs, having again assembled the banquet, did exhort them to turn unto merriment.
**37** Then, having summoned Hermon with a threat, he said: "How many times, O most wretched man, must I give thee command concerning these very matters?
**38** Arm thou yet again, even now, the elephants for the morrow, for the destruction of the Jews."
**39** And his kinsmen who reclined with him, marvelling at his unstable mind, did then put forth these words:
**40** "O King, how long wilt thou thus test us as if we were without reason, by commanding now for the third time to destroy them,
**41** and again, upon the very matter, by a change of heart, undoing that which hath been decreed by thee? For which cause the city is disquieted by the expectation,
**42** and being swollen with throngs, doth already oft risk to be plundered." Wherefore the king, a veritable Phalaris in all his ways, being filled with unreason, and esteeming as naught the changes of soul that befell him concerning the [purposed] visitation upon the Jews, did deem the work most incomplete,
**43** having determined that these [Jews] he would, without delay, send unto Hades, mangled by the knees and feet of beasts; and that he would campaign against Judea, and make it level with fire and spear with haste; and their temple, which is inaccessible unto us, he would quickly lay prostrate with fire, and would render desolate the sacrifice offered therein for all time.
**44** Then the friends and kinsmen, departing full of exceeding joy and with faith, did array the forces in the most opportune places of the city for the [purpose of] guarding.
**45** And the elephant-master, having well-nigh, as it were, urged the beasts into a state of madness, they being terribly arrayed with devices and with most fragrant drinks of frankincensed wine,
**46** then, about the dawn, the city being already filled with innumerable throngs at the hippodrome, he entered into the courtyard and did urge the king concerning the matter set before them.
**47** But he, having filled his impious mind with grievous wrath, did rush forth with all his might, together with the beasts, desiring with an unwavering heart and with the pupils of his eyes to behold the grievous and wretched destruction of those who had been marked for doom.
**48** And as the elephants went forth near the gate, and as the armed force did follow, and when the Jews beheld the dusty march of the multitude, and heard the heavy-sounding tumult,
**49** supposing that this was for them the last turn of life, and the end of their most wretched expectation, they turned themselves unto lamentation and weeping; they kissed one another, embracing their kinsmen, falling upon their necks, even parents upon their children and mothers upon young maidens;
**50** whilst others, having newborn infants at their breasts, did suffer them to draw milk for the last time. Yet not only so, but also having perceived the former assistances from heaven that had been wrought for them, they cast themselves down prostrate with one accord,
**51** and having parted the infants from their breasts, they cried out with a very great voice, imploring the Ruler of all things, that He would, with a manifestation [of His power], take pity upon them, who were already standing at the gates of Hades.
