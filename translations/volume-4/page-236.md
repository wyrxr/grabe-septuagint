**13** σκοπὴ ψυχῶν ἁγίων· καὶ εὐνοῦχος ὁ μὴ ἐργασάμενος ἐν χειρὶ **14** ἀνόμημα, μηδὲ ἐνθυμηθεὶς κατὰ τοῦ Κυρίου πονηρά, δοθήσεται γὰρ αὐτῷ τῆς πίστεως χάρις ἐκλεκτὴ, καὶ κλῆρος ἐν ναῷ Κυρίου θυμηδέστερος. **15** Ἀγαθῶν γὰρ πόνων καρπὸς εὐκλεὴς, καὶ ἀδιάπτωτος ἡ ῥίζα τῆς φρονήσεως. **16** Τέκνα δὲ μοιχῶν ἀτέλεσα ἔσται, καὶ ἐκ παρανόμου κοίτης σπέρμα ἀφανισθήσεται. **17** Ἐάν τε γὰρ μακρόβιοι γένωνται, εἰς οὐδὲν λογισθήσονται, καὶ ἄτιμον ἐπ’ ἐσχάτων τὸ γῆρας αὐτῶν· **18** ἐάν τε γὰρ ὀξέως τελευτήσωσιν, οὐχ ἕξουσιν ἐλπίδα, οὐδὲ ἐν ἡμέρᾳ διαγνώσεως παραμύθιον· **19** γενεὰς γὰρ ἀδίκου χαλεπὰ τὰ τέλη.

**ΚΕΦ. Δ´. IV.**

**1** ΚΡΕΙΣΣΩΝ ἀτεκνία μετὰ ἀρετῆς· ἀθανασία γάρ ἐστιν ἐν μνήμῃ αὐτῆς, ὅτι καὶ παρὰ Θεῷ γινώσκεται καὶ παρὰ ἀνθρώποις· **2** παροῦσάν τε τιμοῦσιν αὐτὴν, καὶ ποθοῦσιν ἀπελθοῦσαν· καὶ ἐν τῷ αἰῶνι στεφανηφοροῦσα πομπεύει, τὸν τῶν ἀμιάντων ἄθλων ἀγῶνα νικήσασα. **3** Πολύγονον δὲ ἀσεβῶν πλῆθος οὐ χρησιμεύσει, καὶ ἐκ νόθων μοσχευμάτων οὐ δώσει ῥίζαν εἰς βάθος, οὐδὲ ἀσφαλῆ βάσιν ἑδράσει· **4** κἂν γὰρ ἐν κλάδοις πρὸς καιρὸν ἀναθάλῃ, ἐπισφαλῶς βεβηκότα ὑπὸ ἀνέμου σαλευθήσεται, καὶ ὑπὸ βίας ἀνέμων ἐκριζωθήσεται· **5** περικλασθήσονται κλῶνες ἀτελέστατοι, καὶ ὁ καρπὸς αὐτῶν ἄχρηστος, ἄωρος εἰς βρῶσιν καὶ εἰς οὐδὲν ἐπιτήδειος. **6** Ἐκ γὰρ ἀνόμων ὕπνων τέκνα γεννώμενα μάρτυρές εἰσιν πονηρίας κατὰ γονέων ἐν ἐξετασμῷ αὐτῶν· **7** Δίκαιος δὲ ἐὰν φθάσῃ τελευτῆσαι, ἐν ἀναπαύσει ἔσται. **8** Γῆρας γὰρ τίμιον οὐ τὸ πολυχρόνιον, οὐδὲ ἀριθμῷ ἐτῶν μεμέτρηται· **9** πολιὰ δὲ ἐστι φρόνησις ἀνθρώποις, καὶ ἡλικία γήρως βίος ἀκηλίδωτος. **10** Εὐάρεστος Θεῷ γενόμενος ἠγαπήθη, καὶ ζῶν μεταξὺ ἁμαρτωλῶν μετετέθη· **11** ἡρπάγη μὴ κακία ἀλλάξῃ σύνεσιν αὐτοῦ, ἢ δόλος ἀπατήσῃ ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ. **12** Βασκανία γὰρ φαυλότητος ἀμαυροῖ τὰ καλά, καὶ ῥεμβασμὸς ἐπιθυμίας μεταλλεύει νοῦν ἄκακον. **13** Τελειωθεὶς ἐν ὀλίγῳ ἐπλήρωσε χρόνους μακρούς· **14** ἀρεστὴ γὰρ ἦν Κυρίῳ ἡ ψυχὴ αὐτοῦ, διὰ τοῦτο ἔσπευσεν ἐκ μέσου πονηρίας. **15** Οἱ δὲ λαοὶ ἰδόντες, καὶ μὴ νοήσαντες, μηδὲ θέντες ἐπὶ διανοίᾳ τὸ τοιοῦτο· ὅτι χάρις καὶ ἔλεος ἐν τοῖς ἐκλεκτοῖς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπισκοπὴ ἐν τοῖς ὁσίοις

**CHAPTER III.**

**13** visitation of holy souls.
**14** And blessed is the eunuch who hath wrought with his hand no wickedness, nor thought evil things against the Lord; for unto him shall be given a chosen grace of faith, and a more delightful inheritance in the temple of the Lord.
**15** For the fruit of good labors is glorious, and the root of prudence is unfailing.
**16** But the children of adulterers shall be unblessed, and the offspring of an unlawful bed shall utterly vanish.
**17** For even if they live long, they shall be accounted as nothing, and their old age shall be without honor in the end.
**18** And if they die swiftly, they shall have no hope, nor any comfort in the day of judgment.
**19** For grievous are the ends of an unrighteous generation.

**CHAPTER IV.**

**1** Better is childlessness, if it be with virtue; for in its memory is immortality, because it is known both unto God and unto men.
**2** Both while it is present, do they honor it, and when it is departed, do they long for it; and in the age [to come], crowned, it doth triumph, having vanquished in the contest of undefiled labors.
**3** But the numerous multitude of the ungodly shall be of no profit, and from illegitimate graftings, it shall not strike a deep root, nor establish a firm foundation.
**4** For though for a time it put forth branches, yet, standing insecurely, it shall be shaken by the wind, and by the violence of winds it shall be uprooted.
**5** Its unripe branches shall be broken off, and their fruit is worthless, unripe for eating, and fit for naught.
**6** For children born of unlawful unions are witnesses of the wickedness against their parents in the day of their reckoning.
**7** But if the righteous man be cut off early by death, he shall be at rest.
**8** For honorable old age is not that which is of long duration, nor is it measured by the number of years.
**9** But gray hairs are wisdom unto men, and an unblemished life is ripe old age.
**10** Being pleasing unto God, he was beloved, and while living among sinners, he was translated [to another place].
**11** He was snatched away, lest malice corrupt his understanding, or deceit beguile his soul.
**12** For the envy of depravity doth obscure that which is good, and the wandering of desire doth pervert an innocent mind.
**13** Being made perfect in a short space of time, he fulfilled long years.
**14** For pleasing unto the Lord was his soul, and therefore did He hasten him out of the midst of wickedness.
**15** But the peoples, seeing [this], and not understanding, neither laying it to heart: that grace and mercy are in His elect, and a visitation among His holy ones,
