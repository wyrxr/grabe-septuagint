**ΚΕΦ. Ϛʹ. Ζʹ. ΙΗΣΟΥ ΥΙΟΥ ΣΙΡΑΧ 1795**
Κύριον εὑρήσουσιν αὐτόν. Ὁ φοβούμενος Κύριον εὐθύνει φιλίαν 17
αὐτοῦ, ὅτι κατ᾿ αὐτὸν οὕτως καὶ ὁ πλησίον αὐτοῦ. Τέκνον ἐκ 18
νεότητός σου ἐπίλεξαι παιδείαν, καὶ ἕως πολιῶν εὑρήσεις σοφίαν. 19
Ὡς ὁ ἀροτριῶν καὶ ὡς ὁ σπείρων πρόσελθε αὐτῇ, καὶ ἀνάμενε 19
τοὺς ἀγαθοὺς καρποὺς αὐτῆς· ἐν γὰρ τῇ ἐργασίᾳ αὐτῆς ὀλίγον 20
κοπιάσεις, καὶ ταχὺ φάγεσαι τῶν γεννημάτων αὐτῆς. Ὡς τρα- 20
χεῖά ἐστι σφόδρα τοῖς ἀπαιδεύτοις, καὶ οὐκ ἐμμενεῖ ἐν αὐτῇ ἀκάρ- 21
διος· ὡς λίθος δοκιμασίας ἰσχυρὸς ἐστι ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ, καὶ οὐ χρονιεῖ 21
ἀπορρῖψαι αὐτήν. Σοφία γὰρ κατὰ τὸ ὄνομα αὐτῆς ἐστι, καὶ οὐ 22
πολλοῖς ἐστι φανερά. Ἄκουσον τέκνον καὶ ἔκδεξαι τὴν γνώμην 23
μου, καὶ μὴ ἀπαινῇς τὴν συμβουλίαν μου· καὶ εἰσένεγκαι τοὺς 24
πόδας σου εἰς τὰς πέδας αὐτῆς, καὶ εἰς τὸν κλοιὸν αὐτῆς τὸν 24
τράχηλόν σου· ὑπόθες τὸν ὦμόν σου, καὶ βάσταζον αὐτήν, καὶ 25
μὴ προσόχθισῃς τοῖς δεσμοῖς αὐτῆς· ἐν πάσῃ ψυχῇ σου πρόσελθε 26
αὐτῇ, καὶ ἐν ὅλῃ δυνάμει σου τήρησον τὰς ὁδοὺς αὐτῆς. Ἐξίχνευ- 27
σον καὶ ζήτησον, καὶ γνωσθήσεταί σοι, καὶ ἐγκρατὴς γενόμενος 28
μὴ ἀφῇς αὐτήν· ἐπ᾿ ἐσχάτων γὰρ εὑρήσεις τὴν ἀνάπαυσιν αὐτῆς, 28
καὶ στραφήσεταί σοι εἰς εὐφροσύνην· καὶ ἔσονται σοι αἱ πέδαι εἰς 29
σκέπην ἰσχύος, καὶ οἱ κλοιοὶ αὐτῆς εἰς στολὴν δόξης. Κόσμος γὰρ 30
χρύσεός ἐστιν ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς, καὶ οἱ δεσμοὶ αὐτῆς κλῶσμα ὑακίνθινον· 30
στολὴν δόξης ἔνδυσαι αὐτήν, καὶ στέφανον ἀγαλλιάματος περιθήσεις 31
σεαυτῷ. Ἐὰν θέλῃς τέκνον, παιδευθήσῃ, καὶ ἐὰν ἐπιδῷς τὴν ψυ- 32
χήν σου, πανοῦργος ἔσῃ· καὶ ἐὰν ἀγαπήσῃς ἀκούειν, ἐκλέξῃ σύνε- 33
σιν, καὶ ἐὰν κλίνῃς τὸ οὖς σου, σοφὸς ἔσῃ. Ἐν πλήθει πρεσβυ- 34
τέρων στῆθι, καὶ τίς σοφός, αὐτῷ προσκολλήθητι· πᾶσαν διήγησιν 35
θείαν θέλε ἀκροᾶσθαι, καὶ παροιμίαι συνέσεως μὴ ἐκφυγέτωσάν 36
σε· ἐὰν ἴδῃς συνετόν, ὄρθριζε πρὸς αὐτόν, καὶ βημαδοὺς θυρῶν 37
αὐτοῦ ἐκτριβέτω ὁ πούς σου. Διανοοῦ ἐν τοῖς προστάγμασι Κυ-
ρίου, καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἐντολαῖς αὐτοῦ μελέτα διαπαντός· αὐτὸς στη-
ριεῖ τὴν καρδίαν σου, καὶ ἡ ἐπιθυμία τῆς σοφίας δοθήσεταί σοι.

**ΚΕΦ. Ζʹ. VII.**

Μὴ ποίει κακά, καὶ οὐ μὴ σε καταλάβῃ κακὸν ἀπόστηθι ἀπὸ 1. 2
ἀδίκου, καὶ ἐκκλίνει ἀπὸ σοῦ ἀδικία· υἱὲ μὴ σπεῖρε ἐπ᾿ αὔλακας 3
ἀδικίας, καὶ οὐ μὴ θερίσῃς αὐτὰ ἑπταπλάσια. Μὴ ζήτει παρὰ 4
Κυρίου ἡγεμονίαν, μηδὲ παρὰ βασιλέως καθέδραν δόξης. Μὴ δι- 5
καιοῦ ἔναντι Κυρίου, καὶ παρὰ βασιλεῖ μὴ σοφίζου. Μὴ ζήτει 6
γενέσθαι κριτής, μὴ οὐκ ἰσχύσῃς ἐξᾶραι ἀδικίας· μήποτε εὐλαβη-
θῇς ἀπὸ προσώπου δυνάστου, καὶ θήσεις σκάνδαλον ἐν εὐθύτητί
σου. Μὴ ἁμάρτανε εἰς πλῆθος πόλεως, καὶ μὴ καταβάλῃς σεαυ- 7
τὸν ἐν ὄχλῳ. Μὴ καταδεσμεύσῃς δὶς ἁμαρτίαν· ἐν γὰρ μιᾷ οὐκ 8
ἀθῷος ἔσῃ. Μὴ εἴπῃς· τῷ πλήθει τῶν δώρων μου ἑπόψεται, καὶ 9
ἐν τῷ προσενέγκαι με Θεῷ ὑψίστῳ, προσδέξεται. Μὴ ὀλιγοψυχή- 10
σῃς ἐν τῇ προσευχῇ σου, καὶ ἐλεημοσύνην ποιῆσαι μὴ παρίδῃς. 11
Μὴ καταγέλα ἄνθρωπον ὄντα ἐν πικρίᾳ ψυχῆς αὐτοῦ· ἔστι γὰρ ὁ 12
ταπεινῶν καὶ ἀνυψῶν. Μὴ ἀρότριε ψεῦδος ἐπ᾽ ἀδελφῷ σου, μηδὲ 13
φίλῳ τὸ ὅμοιον ποίει. Μὴ θέλε ψεύδεσθαι πᾶν ψεῦδος· ὁ γὰρ 14
ἐνδελεχισμὸς αὐτοῦ οὐκ εἰς ἀγαθόν. Μὴ ἀδολέσχει ἐν πλήθει πρε- 15
σβυτέρων, καὶ μὴ δευτερώσῃς λόγον ἐν προσευχῇ σου. Μὴ μισή-
σῃς ἐπίπονον ἐργασίαν καὶ γεωργίαν ὑπὸ ὑψίστου ἐκτισμένην. 16
Μὴ προσλογίζου σεαυτὸν ἐν πλήθει ἁμαρτωλῶν· μνήσθητι ὅτι ὀρ- 17
γὴ οὐ χρονιεῖ. Ταπείνωσον σφόδρα τὴν ψυχήν σου, ὅτι ἐκδίκησις 18
ἀσεβοῦς πῦρ καὶ σκώληξ. Μὴ ἀλλάξῃς φίλον διάφορον κατὰ μηδὲ 19
ἕν, μηδὲ ἀδελφὸν γνήσιον ἐν χρυσίῳ Ὄφειρ. Μὴ ἀστόχει γυναι- 20
κὸς σοφῆς καὶ ἀγαθῆς· ἡ γὰρ χάρις αὐτῆς ὑπὲρ τὸ χρυσίον. Μὴ
κακώσῃς οἰκέτην ἐργαζόμενον ἐν ἀληθείᾳ, μηδὲ μίσθιον διδόντα τὴν 21
ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ· οἰκέτην συνετὸν ἀγαπάτω σου ἡ ψυχή· μὴ στέρη- 22
σῃς αὐτὸν ἐλευθερίας. Κτήνη σοι ἐστιν, ἐπισκέπτου αὐτά, καὶ εἰ 23
ἔστι σοι χρήσιμα, ἐμμενέτω σοι. Τέκνα σοι ἐστιν, παίδευσον 24
αὐτά, καὶ κάμψον ἐκ νεότητος τὸν τράχηλον αὐτῶν· θυγατέρες
σοί εἰσι, πρόσεχε τῷ σώματι αὐτῶν, καὶ μὴ ἱλαρώσῃς πρὸς αὐτὰς 25
τὸ πρόσωπόν σου. Ἔκδου θυγατέρα, καὶ ἔσῃ τετελεκὼς ἔργον 26
μέγα· καὶ ἀνδρὶ συνετῷ δώρησαι αὐτήν. Γυνὴ σοι ἔστι κατὰ ψυ- 27
χήν, μὴ ἐκβάλῃς αὐτήν· μισουμένη δὲ μὴ ἐκδῶς σεαυτόν. Ἐν
ὅλῃ καρδίᾳ σου δόξασον τὸν πατέρα σου, καὶ μητρὸς ὠδῖνας μὴ
ἐπιλάβῃ· μνήσθητι ὅτι δι᾽ αὐτῶν ἐγεννήθης, καὶ τί ἀνταποδώσεις 28
αὐτοῖς καθὼς αὐτοὶ σοί; Ἐν ὅλῃ ψυχῇ σου εὐλαβοῦ τὸν Κύριον, 29
καὶ τοὺς ἱερεῖς αὐτοῦ θαύμαζε· ἐν ὅλῃ δυνάμει ἀγάπησον τὸν ποιή- 30
σαντά σε, καὶ τοὺς λειτουργοὺς αὐτοῦ μὴ ἐγκαταλίπῃς. Φοβοῦ 31
τὸν Κύριον, καὶ δόξασον ἱερέα, καὶ δὸς τὴν μερίδα αὐτῷ, καθὼς
ἐντέταλταί σοι, ἀπαρχὴν καὶ περὶ πλημμελείας, καὶ δόσιν βρα-

**Chapter Six**

16 ...the Lord shall find him.
17 He that feareth the Lord shall direct his friendship, for as he himself is, so also is his neighbor.
18 My son, from thy youth choose instruction, and even until thine old age thou shalt find wisdom.
19 As he that plougheth and as he that soweth, draw nigh unto her, and await her good fruits;
20 For in her labor shalt thou toil but little, and quickly shalt thou eat of her produce. She is exceeding rough unto the uninstructed, and the faint-hearted shall not abide in her;
21 As a strong testing stone she is unto him, and he shall not tarry to cast her away.
22 For Wisdom is according to her name, and she is not revealed unto many.
23 Hearken, O son, and receive my judgment, and reject not my counsel;
24 And bring thy feet into her fetters, and thy neck into her collar;
25 Put thy shoulder beneath her, and bear her, and be not offended by her bonds;
26 With all thy soul draw nigh unto her, and with all thy might keep her ways.
27 Search out and seek, and she shall be made known unto thee,
28 And having become master of her, forsake her not; for in the end shalt thou find her rest, and she shall be turned unto thee for joy;
29 And her fetters shall be unto thee a strong covering, and her collars for a robe of glory.
30 For upon her is an ornament of gold, and her bonds are a twisted cord of hyacinthine purple;
31 Clothe thyself with her as a robe of glory, and a crown of rejoicing shalt thou place upon thyself.
32 If thou desirest it, O son, thou shalt be instructed, and if thou givest over thy soul, thou shalt be cunning.
33 And if thou lovest to hearken, thou shalt choose understanding, and if thou inclinest thine ear, thou shalt be wise.
34 Stand thou in the multitude of elders, and whosoever is wise, cleave thou unto him;
35 Desire thou to hearken to every divine narrative, and let not the proverbs of understanding escape thee;
36 If thou seest a man of understanding, rise early to him, and let thy foot wear smooth the steps of his doors.
37 Meditate thou upon the ordinances of the Lord, and in His commandments ponder continually; He himself shall strengthen thy heart, and the desire of wisdom shall be given unto thee.

**Chapter Seven**

1 Do not thou evil, and evil shall not overtake thee.
2 Depart from the unrighteous, and injustice turneth away from thee;
3 My son, sow not upon the furrows of iniquity, and thou shalt not reap them sevenfold.
4 Seek not from the Lord a place of rule, nor from a king a seat of glory.
5 Justify not thyself before the Lord, and before a king be not wise in thine own estimation.
6 Seek not to become a judge, lest thou be not able to remove injustices; lest perchance thou shalt fear the face of a potentate, and shalt place a stumbling-block in thy righteousness.
7 Sin not against the multitude of a city, and cast not thyself down amidst the crowd.
8 Bind not sin twice; for in one [sin] shalt thou not be guiltless.
9 Say not: "By the multitude of my gifts shall He regard [me] favorably," and "When I offer unto God most high, He will accept [it]."
10 Be not faint-hearted in thy prayer, and to perform almsgiving, do not overlook.
11 Mock not a man that is in bitterness of his soul; for there is He that humbleth and exalteth.
12 Plough not falsehood upon thy brother, neither do the like unto a friend.
13 Desire not to lie every lie; for the persistence thereof is not for good.
14 Be not loquacious in the multitude of elders, and repeat not a word in thy prayer.
15 Hate not laborious toil and husbandry, which is ordained by the Most High.
16 Reckon not thyself among the multitude of sinners; remember that wrath will not tarry.
17 Humble thy soul greatly, for the vengeance of the ungodly is fire and worm.
18 Exchange not a friend in any wise different, nor a genuine brother for the gold of Ophir.
19 Miss not a wise and good woman; for her grace is above gold.
20 Mistreat not a servant who worketh in truth, neither a hired hand who giveth his soul [to his work];
21 Let thy soul love a discerning servant; deprive him not of freedom.
22 If thou hast cattle, oversee them, and if they be profitable for thee, let them remain with thee.
23 If thou hast children, instruct them, and bend their neck from their youth.
24 If thou hast daughters, attend to their bodies, and make not thy face cheerful unto them.
25 Give thy daughter in marriage, and thou shalt have completed a great work; and bestow her upon a discerning man.
26 If thou hast a wife after thy soul, cast her not out; but if she be hated, yield not thyself [to abandon her].
27 With all thy heart glorify thy father, and the pangs of thy mother forget not;
28 Remember that through them wast thou born, and what shalt thou render unto them, even as they [rendered] unto thee?
29 With all thy soul revere the Lord, and His priests do thou hold in honor;
30 With all thy might love Him that made thee, and His ministers forsake not.
31 Fear the Lord, and glorify the priest, and give him his portion, as it hath been commanded thee, the firstfruits and for trespasses, and the gift of bri-
