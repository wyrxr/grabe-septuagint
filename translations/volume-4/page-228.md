ΚΕΦ. Ε΄. V.
8 ἵνα βαδίσῃ Ἰσραὴλ ἀσφαλῶς τῇ τοῦ Θεοῦ δόξῃ. Ἐσκίασαν δὲ καὶ
   οἱ δρυμοὶ καὶ πᾶν ξύλον εὐωδίας τῷ Ἰσραὴλ προστάγματι τοῦ Θεοῦ.
9 Ἠγήσεται γὰρ ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραὴλ μετ᾿ εὐφροσύνης τῷ φωτὶ τῆς δόξης
   αὐτοῦ σὺν ἐλεημοσύνῃ καὶ τῇ παρὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ δικαιοσύνῃ.

1 ΑΝΤΙΓΡΑΦΟΝ ἐπιστολῆς, ἧς ἀπέστειλεν Ἱερεμίας πρὸς
   τοὺς ἀχθησομένους αἰχμαλώτους εἰς Βαβυλῶνα ὑπὸ τοῦ βα-
   σιλέως τῶν Βαβυλωνίων, ἀναγγεῖλαι αὐτοῖς καθότι ἐπετάγη
   αὐτῷ ὑπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ· διὰ τὰς ἁμαρτίας, ἃς ἡμαρτήκατε ἔναντι
   τοῦ Θεοῦ, ἀχθήσεσθε εἰς Βαβυλῶνα αἰχμάλωτοι ὑπὸ Ναβουχο-
   δονόσορ τοῦ βασιλέως τῶν Βαβυλωνίων.
2 Εἰσελθόντες οὖν εἰς Βαβυλῶνα, ἔσεσθε ἐκεῖ ἔτη πλείονα καὶ χρόνον
   μακρόν, ἕως γενεῶν ἑπτά· μετὰ τοῦτο δὲ ἐξάξω ὑμᾶς ἐκεῖθεν μετ᾿
   εἰρήνης.
3 Νυνὶ δὲ ὄψεσθε ἐν Βαβυλῶνι Θεοὺς ἀργυροῦς καὶ χρυσοῦς καὶ
   ξυλίνους ἐπ᾿ ὤμοις αἰρομένους, δεικνύντας φόβον τοῖς ἔθνεσιν.
4 Εὐλαβήθητε οὖν μὴ καὶ ὑμεῖς ἀφομοιωθέντες τοῖς ἀλλοφύλοις
   ἀφομοιωθῆτε, καὶ φόβος ὑμᾶς λάβῃ ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῖς, ἴδοντες ὄχλον
5  ἔμπροσθεν καὶ ὄπισθεν αὐτῶν προσκυνοῦντας οὗτα· εἴπατε δὲ τῇ
   διανοίᾳ· σοὶ δεῖ προσκυνεῖν, δέσποτα.
6 Ὁ γὰρ ἄγγελός μου μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν ἐστι, αὐτὸς τε ἐκζητῶν τὰς ψυχὰς
   ὑμῶν.
7 Γλῶσσα γὰρ αὐτῶν ἐστὶ κατεξυσμένη ὑπὸ τέκτονος, αὐτὰ τε
   περίχρυσα καὶ περίάργυρα, ψευδῆ δὲ ἐστι καὶ οὐ δύνανται λαλεῖν,
8  καὶ ὥσπερ παρθένῳ φιλοκόσμῳ λαμβάνοντες χρυσίον, κατασκευάζουσι
9  στεφάνους ἐπὶ τὰς κεφαλὰς τῶν θεῶν αὐτῶν· ἔστι δὲ καὶ ὅτι
   ὑφαιρούμενοι οἱ ἱερεῖς
                  (Τόμ. Δ΄.)                       15

**CHAPTER V.**

**8** that Israel might walk safely in the glory of God. Moreover, the groves also cast their shade, and every fragrant tree, for Israel by the commandment of God.
**9** For God shall lead Israel with joy, in the light of His glory, with mercy and with the righteousness that comes from God.

**THE EPISTLE OF JEREMIAH.**

**CHAPTER I.**

**1** A copy of the letter, which Jeremiah sent unto them that were to be led captive into Babylon by the king of the Babylonians, to declare unto them as it was commanded him by God: For the sins which ye have committed before God, ye shall be led away captive into Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar, the king of the Babylonians.
**2** Therefore, when ye have come into Babylon, ye shall be there for many years and for a long season, even unto seven generations; but after this, I shall bring you forth from thence with peace.
**3** But now, ye shall see in Babylon gods of silver and of gold and of wood, borne upon shoulders, exhibiting [that which inspires] reverence among the nations.
**4** Be ye therefore wary, lest ye also be assimilated and made like unto the heathen, and fear take hold upon you concerning them, when ye behold the multitude
**5** before and behind them, worshipping these things. But say ye in your heart: "Thee alone ought we to worship, O Master."
**6** For My Angel is with you, and He Himself shall seek out your souls.
**7** For their tongue is carved by a craftsman, and they are overlaid with gold and silver, but they are false and cannot speak.
**8** And as for a maiden who loves adornment, they take gold and fashion
**9** crowns upon the heads of their gods. And it also happens that the priests steal from their gods,
