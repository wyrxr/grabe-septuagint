τῷ υἱῷ μου· βάδισον, καὶ ἄγαγε ὂν ἐὰν εὕρῃς τῶν ἀδελφῶν ἡ-
μῶν ἐνδεῆ, ὃς μέμνηται τοῦ Κυρίου, καὶ ἰδοὺ μένω σε. Καὶ ἐλ- 3
θών, εἶπε· πάτερ, εἷς ἐκ τοῦ γένους ἡμῶν ἐστραγγαλμένος ἔρ-
ῥηπται ἐν τῇ ἀγορᾷ. Κἀγὼ πρὶν γεύσασθαί με, ἀναπηδήσας 4
ἀνειλόμην αὐτὸν εἰς τι οἴκημα ἕως οὗ ἔδυ ὁ ἥλιος. Καὶ ἐπιστρέ- 5
ψας ἐλουσάμην, καὶ ἤσθιον τὸν ἄρτον μου ἐν λύπῃ. Καὶ ἐμνή- 6
σθην τῆς προφητείας Ἀμώς, καθώς εἶπε· στραφήσονται αἱ ἑορταὶ
ὑμῶν εἰς πένθος, καὶ πᾶσαι αἱ εὐφροσύναι ὑμῶν εἰς θρῆνον. Καὶ 7
ἔκλαυσα, καὶ ὅτε ἔδυ ὁ ἥλιος, ὠχόμην, καὶ ὀρύξας ἔθαψα αὐτόν.
Καὶ οἱ πλησίον ἐπεγέλων, λέγοντες· οὐκ ἔτι φοβεῖται οὗτος φο- 8
νευθῆναι περὶ τοῦ πράγματος τούτου, καὶ ἀποδρᾷ, καὶ ἰδοὺ πάλιν
θάπτει τοὺς νεκρούς. Καὶ ἐν αὐτῇ τῇ νυκτὶ ἀνελῦσα θάψας, καὶ 9
ἐκοιμήθην μεμιαμμένος παρὰ τὸν τοῖχον τῆς αὐλῆς· καὶ τὸ πρό-
σωπόν μου ἀκάλυπτον ἦν· καὶ οὐκ ᾔδειν ὅτι στρουθία ἐν τῷ τοί- 10
χῳ ἐστί· καὶ τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν μου ἀνεῳγότων, ἀφώδευσαν τὰ
στρουθία θερμὸν εἰς τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς μου, καὶ ἐγενήθη λευκώματα
ἐν τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς μου, καὶ ἐπορεύθην πρὸς ἰατρούς, καὶ οὐκ ὠ-
φέλησάν με. Ἀχιάχαρος δὲ ἔτρεφέ με ἕως οὗ ἐπορεύθην εἰς τὴν
Ἑλυμαΐδα. Καὶ ἡ γυνή μου Ἄννα ἠρίθευετο ἐν τοῖς γυναικείοις, 11
καὶ ἀπέστελλε τοῖς κυρίοις. καὶ ἀπέδωκαν αὐτῇ καὶ αὐτοὶ τὸν 12
μισθόν, προσδόντες καὶ ἔριφον. Ὅτε δὲ ἦλθε πρὸς μὲ, ἤρξατο 13
κράζειν· καὶ εἶπον αὐτῇ· πόθεν τὸ ἔριφον ; μὴ κλεψίμαιον ἐστίν ;
ἀπόδος αὐτὸ τοῖς κυρίοις· οὐ γὰρ θεμιτόν ἐστι φαγεῖν κλεψίμαιον.
Ἡ δὲ εἶπε· δῶρον δέδοταί μοι ἐπὶ τῷ μισθῷ· καὶ οὐκ ἐπίστευον 14
αὐτῇ· καὶ ἔλεγον ἀποδιδόναι αὐτὸ τοῖς κυρίοις, καὶ ἠρυθρίων
πρὸς αὐτήν· ἡ δὲ ἀποκριθεῖσα εἶπέ μοι· ποῦ εἰσιν αἱ ἐλεημοσύναι
σου, καὶ αἱ δικαιοσύναι σου ; ἰδοὺ γνωστὰ πάντα μετά σου.

ΚΕΦ. Γ΄. ΙΙΙ.

ΚΑΙ λυπηθεὶς ἔκλαυσα, καὶ προσηυξάμην μετ᾿ ὀδύνης, λέ- 1
γων· δίκαιος εἶ, Κύριε, καὶ πάντα τὰ ἔργα σου καὶ πᾶσαι αἱ ὁδοί 2
σου ἐλεημοσύναι καὶ ἀλήθεια, καὶ κρίσιν ἀληθινὴν καὶ δικαίαν σὺ
κρίνεις εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα. Μνήσθητί μου, καὶ ἐπίβλεψον ἐπ᾿ ἐμέ· μὴ 3
με ἐκδικήσῃς ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις μου καὶ τοῖς ἀγνοήμασί μου καὶ τῶν
πατέρων μου, οἳ ἥμαρτον ἐνώπιόν σου. Παρήκουσαν γὰρ τῶν 4
ἐντολῶν σου, καὶ ἔδωκας ἡμᾶς εἰς ἁρπαγὴν καὶ αἰχμαλωσίαν
καὶ θάνατον καὶ παραβολὴν ὀνειδισμοῦ πᾶσι τοῖς ἔθνεσιν ἐν οἷς
ἐσκορπίσμεθα.

**CHAPTER II.**

Then said I unto my son, "Go forth, and bring whomever thou shalt find
among our brethren that is in need, who remembers the Lord;
and lo, I await thee."
3 And he came, and said, "Father, one of our kindred, having been strangled,
is cast forth in the marketplace."
4 And I, before I tasted [of my meal], leaping up, took him into a certain dwelling
until the sun set.
5 And returning, I washed myself, and did eat my bread with sorrow.
6 And I remembered the prophecy of Amos, as he said:
"Your feasts shall be turned into mourning, and all your joys into lamentation."
7 And I wept; and when the sun set, I went forth, and having dug, I buried him.
8 And those nearby laughed at me, saying, "Doth not this man fear any longer
to be put to death for this matter, [who] also fled away?
And behold, again he buries the dead!"
9 And in that same night, having withdrawn after burying [him],
I slept, being defiled, by the wall of the courtyard; and my face was uncovered.
10 And I knew not that sparrows were on the wall; and my eyes being open,
the sparrows did void warm [droppings] into my eyes,
and white films were formed in my eyes.
And I went unto physicians, but they profited me nothing.
Now Achiachar did nourish me until I went into Elymais.
11 And Anna, my wife, did labor among the women, and sent [the works] unto the masters.
12 And they, for their part, paid her the wage, having also given her a kid in addition.
13 Now when it came unto me, it began to bleat;
and I said unto her, "Whence is this kid? Is it not stolen?
Return it unto the masters, for it is not lawful to eat that which is stolen."
14 But she said, "It was given unto me as a gift, over and above the wage."
And I believed her not; and I urged [her] to return it unto the masters, and I upbraided her.
Then she answered and said unto me, "Where are thine alms, and thy righteous deeds?
Lo, all things are known concerning thee!"

**CHAPTER III.**

1 And being grieved, I wept, and prayed with anguish, saying:
2 "Righteous art Thou, O Lord, and all Thy works and all Thy ways are mercy and truth;
and a true and righteous judgment dost Thou judge unto the ages.
3 Remember me, and look upon me;
do not Thou take vengeance upon me for my sins and for my ignorances,
and for those of my fathers, who have sinned before Thee.
4 For they did disobey Thy commandments,
and Thou didst deliver us into pillage and captivity, and unto death,
and [didst make us] a proverb of reproach unto all the nations among whom we are scattered."
