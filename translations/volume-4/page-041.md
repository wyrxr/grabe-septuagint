#### ΚΕΦ. ΙΑ΄.

21 καὶ ἐθαύμασαν ἐπὶ τῇ σοφίᾳ αὐτῆς, καὶ εἶπαν. Οὐκ ἔστι τοιαύτη
γυνὴ ἀπ’ ἄκρου ἕως ἄκρου τῆς γῆς ἐν καλῷ προσώπῳ καὶ συνέσει
λόγων. 22 Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτὴν Ὁλοφέρνης· εὖ ἐποίησεν ὁ Θεὸς
ἀποστείλας σε ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ λαοῦ, τοῦ γενηθῆναι ἐν χερσὶν ἡμῶν
κράτος, ἐν δὲ τοῖς φαυλίσασι τὸν κύριόν μου, ἀπώλειαν. 23 Καὶ νῦν
ἀστεῖα εἶ σὺ ἐν τῷ εἴδει σου, καὶ ἀγαθὴ ἐν τοῖς λόγοις σου. ὅτι
ἐὰν ποιήσῃς καθὰ ἐλάλησας, ὁ Θεός σου ἔσται μου Θεός, καὶ σὺ
ἐν οἴκῳ βασιλέως Ναβουχοδονόσορ καθήσῃ, καὶ ἔσῃ ὀνομαστὴ
παρὰ πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν.

#### ΚΕΦ. ΙΒ΄. ΧΙΙ.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐκέλευσεν εἰσαγαγεῖν αὐτὴν οὗ ἐτίθετο τὰ ἀργυρώματα
αὐτοῦ, καὶ συνέταξε καταστρῶσαι αὐτῇ ἀπὸ τῶν ὀψοποιημάτων
αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοῦ οἴνου αὐτοῦ πιεῖν. 2 Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰουδίθ· οὐ φάγομαι
ἐξ αὐτῶν, ἵνα μὴ γένηται σκάνδαλον, ἀλλὰ ἐκ τῶν ἠκολουθηκό-
των μοι χορηγηθήσεται. 3 Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτὴν Ὁλοφέρνης· ἐὰν
δὲ ἐκλίπῃ τὰ ὄντα μετὰ σοῦ, πόθεν ἕξομέν σοι δοῦναι τὰ ὅμοια
αὐτοῖς; οὐ γάρ ἐστι μεθ’ ἡμῶν ἐκ τοῦ γένους σου. 4 Καὶ εἶπεν
Ἰουδὶθ πρὸς αὐτόν· Ζῇ ἡ ψυχή σου, κύριέ μου, ὅτι οὐ δαπανήσει
ἡ δούλη σου τὰ ὄντα μετ’ ἐμοῦ, ἕως ἂν ποιήσῃ Κύριος ἐν χειρί
μου ἃ ἐβουλεύσατο. 5 Καὶ ἠγάγατον αὐτὴν οἱ θεράποντες Ὀλο-
φέρνου εἰς τὴν σκηνήν, καὶ ὕπνωσε μέχρι μεσούσης νυκτός· 6 καὶ
ἀνέστη πρὸς τὴν ἑωθινὴν φυλακήν, καὶ ἀπέστειλε πρὸς Ὁλοφέρ-
νην, λέγουσα· ἐπιταξάτω δὴ ὁ κύριός μου, ἐᾶσαι τὴν δούλην σου
ἐξελθεῖν ἐπὶ προσευχήν. 7 Καὶ προσέταξεν Ὁλοφέρνης τοῖς σωμα-
τοφύλαξι μὴ διακωλύειν αὐτήν. καὶ παρέμεινεν ἐν τῇ παρεμβο-
λῇ ἡμέρας τρεῖς, καὶ ἐξεπορεύετο κατὰ νύκτα εἰς τὴν φάραγγα
Βετυλούα, καὶ ἐβαπτίζετο ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ ἐπὶ τῆς πηγῆς τοῦ
ὕδατος. 8 Καὶ ὡς ἀνέβη, ἐδέετο Κυρίου Θεοῦ Ἰσραὴλ κατευθῦναι
τὴν ὁδὸν αὐτῆς εἰς ἀνάστημα τῶν υἱῶν τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ. 9 Καὶ εἰσ-
πορευομένη καθαρὰ παρέμενεν ἐν τῇ σκηνῇ, μέχρι οὗ προσή-
νέγκατο τὴν τροφὴν αὐτῆς πρὸς ἑσπέραν. 10 Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῇ ἡ-
μέρᾳ τῇ τετάρτῃ, ἐποίησεν Ὁλοφέρνης πότον τοῖς δούλοις αὐτοῦ
μόνοις, καὶ οὐκ ἐκάλεσεν εἰς τὴν χρῆσιν οὐδένα τῶν πρὸς ταῖς
χρείαις. 11 Καὶ εἶπε Βαγώᾳ τῷ εὐνούχῳ, ὃς ἦν ἐφεστηκὼς ἐπὶ

#### CHAPTER 11

**21** And they marveled at her wisdom, and said, "There is not such a woman from one end of the earth unto the other, [endowed] with such beauty of countenance and understanding of words."

**22** And Holofernes said unto her, "God hath done well in sending thee before the people, that there might be strength in our hands, and destruction unto them that have brought contempt upon my lord."

**23** "And now thou art graceful in thy countenance, and good in thy words. For if thou shalt do as thou hast spoken, thy God shall be my God, and thou shalt sit in the house of King Nebuchadnezzar, and shalt be renowned throughout all the earth."

#### CHAPTER 12

**1** And he commanded to bring her in where his silver was kept, and he gave order to set before her of his own prepared meats, and of his own wine to drink.

**2** And Judith said, "I will not eat of them, lest it become a stumbling block, but [food] shall be provided for me from that which hath come with me."

**3** And Holofernes said unto her, "But if the provisions that are with thee shall fail, whence shall we have to give unto thee such like as them? For there is none of thy race with us."

**4** And Judith said unto him, "As thy soul liveth, my lord, thy handmaiden shall not consume that which is with me, until the Lord shall have wrought by my hand that which He hath purposed."

**5** And the servants of Holofernes led her into the tent, and she slept until midnight.

**6** And she rose up toward the morning watch, and sent to Holofernes, saying, "Let my lord now command that thy handmaiden be permitted to go forth for prayer."

**7** And Holofernes commanded his bodyguards not to hinder her. And she abode in the camp three days, and went forth by night into the ravine of Bethulia, and did purify herself within the camp at the spring of water.

**8** And as she ascended, she prayed unto the Lord God of Israel to direct her path for the uplifting of the sons of His people.

**9** And having entered, [being] pure, she abode in the tent, until she partook of her food toward evening.

**10** And it came to pass on the fourth day, that Holofernes made a banquet for his own servants only, and called none of those who were engaged in public affairs to partake [thereof].

**11** And he said unto Bagoas the eunuch, who was set over
