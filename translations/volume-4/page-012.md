ἀγγέλῳ· Ἀζαρία ἀδελφέ, ἀκήκοα ἐγὼ τὸ κοράσιον δεδόσθαι ἑπτὰ
ἀνδράσι, καὶ πάντας ἐν τῷ νυμφῶνι ἀπολωλότας. Καὶ νῦν μό- 15
νος ἐγώ εἰμι τῷ πατρί, καὶ φοβοῦμαι μὴ εἰσελθὼν ἀποθάνω κα-
θὼς καὶ οἱ πρότεροι, διότι δαιμόνιον φιλεῖ αὐτήν, ὃ οὐκ ἀδικεῖ
οὐδένα πλὴν τῶν προσαγόντων αὐτῇ. καὶ νῦν ἐγὼ φοβοῦμαι μὴ
ἀποθάνω, καὶ καταξέω τὴν ζωὴν τοῦ πατρός μου καὶ τῆς μητρός
μου μετ᾿ ὀδύνης ἐπ᾿ ἐμοὶ εἰς τὸν τάφον αὐτῶν, καὶ υἱὸς ἕτερος
οὐχ ὑπάρχει αὐτοῖς ὅς θάψει αὐτούς. Εἶπε δὲ αὐτῷ ὁ ἄγγελος· 16
οὐ μέμνησαι τῶν λόγων, ὧν ἐνετείλατό σοι ὁ πατήρ σου ὑπὲρ τοῦ
λόγου τούτου, τοῦ λαβεῖν σε γυναῖκα ἐκ τοῦ γένους σου; καὶ νῦν
ἄκουσόν μου, ἀδελφέ, διότι σοὶ ἔσται εἰς γυναῖκα, καὶ τοῦ δαιμο-
νίου μηδένα λόγον ἔχε, ὅτι τὴν νύκτα ταύτην δοθήσεταί σοι αὕτη
εἰς γυναῖκα. Καὶ ἐὰν εἰσέλθῃς εἰς τὸν νυμφῶνα, λήψῃ τέφραν θυ- 17
μιαμάτων, καὶ ἐπιθήσεις ἀπὸ τῆς καρδίας καὶ τοῦ ἥπατος τοῦ ἰχθύ-
ος, καὶ καπνίσεις· καὶ ὀσφρανθήσεται τὸ δαιμόνιον, καὶ φεύξεται, 18
καὶ οὐκ ἐπανελεύσεται εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τοῦ αἰῶνος. ὅταν δὲ προσπο-
ρεύσῃ αὐτῇ, ἐγέρθητε ἀμφότεροι, καὶ βοήσατε πρὸς τὸν ἐλεήμονα
Θεόν, καὶ σώσει ὑμᾶς, καὶ ἐλεήσει. μὴ φοβοῦ ὅτι σοὶ αὕτη ἡτοι-
μασμένη ἦν ἀπὸ τοῦ αἰῶνος, καὶ σὺ αὐτὴν σώσεις, καὶ πορεύσεται
μετὰ σοῦ, καὶ ὑπολαμβάνω ὅτι σοὶ ἔσται ἐξ αὐτῆς παιδία. καὶ
ὡς ἤκουσε Τωβίας ταῦτα, ἐφίλησεν αὐτήν, καὶ ἡ ψυχὴ αὐτοῦ
κεκόλλητο σφόδρα αὐτῇ. Καὶ ἦλθον εἰς ᾿Εκβάτανα.

ΚΕΦ. Ζʹ. VII.

ΚΑΙ παρεγένοντο εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν ῾Ραγουήλ· Σάρῥα δὲ ὑπήντησεν 1
αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἐχαιρέτισεν αὐτούς, καὶ αὐτοὶ αὐτήν· καὶ εἰ-
σήγαγεν αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν. Καὶ εἶπε ῾Ραγουὴλ ῎Εδνα τῇ γυ- 2
ναικὶ αὐτοῦ· ὡς ὅμοιος ὁ νεανίσκος τῷ Τωβὶτ τῷ ἀνεψιῷ μου;
Καὶ ἠρώτησεν αὐτοὺς ῾Ραγουήλ· πόθεν ἐστέ, ἀδελφοί; καὶ εἶ- 3
πον αὐτῷ· ἐκ τῶν υἱῶν Νεφθαλὶμ τῶν αἰχμαλώτων τῶν ἐν
Νινευή. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· γινώσκετε Τωβὶτ τὸν ἀδελφὸν ἡμῶν; 4
οἱ δὲ εἶπαν· γινώσκομεν. καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· ὑγιαίνει; Οἱ δὲ εἶ- 5
παν· καὶ ζῇ, καὶ ὑγιαίνει. καὶ εἶπε Τωβίας· πατήρ μου ἐστί. Καὶ 6
ἀνεπήδησε ῾Ραγουήλ, καὶ κατεφίλησεν αὐτόν, καὶ ἔκλαυσε, καὶ 7
ηὐλόγησεν αὐτόν, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· ὁ τοῦ καλοῦ καὶ ἀγαθοῦ ἀν-

[Tobit 6:14]
the angel, "Azariah, my brother, I have heard that the maiden was given unto seven men, and all of them perished in the bridal chamber.

[Tobit 6:15]
And now I am the only [son] unto my father, and I fear lest I go in and die, even as the former [husbands] did; for a demon doth love her, which wrongeth none save those who draw nigh unto her. And now I fear lest I die, and bring down the lives of my father and my mother with anguish on my account, unto their grave, for there is no other son to them who shall bury them."

[Tobit 6:16]
Then said the angel unto him, "Dost thou not remember the words which thy father charged thee concerning this very matter, that thou shouldst take a wife from thine own kindred? And now hearken unto me, my brother, for she shall be given unto thee to be thy wife, and of the demon take thou no thought, for this very night shall she be given unto thee to be thy wife.

[Tobit 6:17]
And when thou shalt enter into the bridal chamber, thou shalt take of the ashes of incense, and shalt lay upon them [some] of the heart and of the liver of the fish, and shalt make a smoke thereof;

[Tobit 6:18]
and the demon shall smell [the savor], and shall flee, and shall not return for ever and evermore. And when thou shalt draw nigh unto her, rise ye up both, and cry out unto the merciful God, and He shall save you, and shall have mercy. Fear not, for this one was prepared for thee from everlasting, and thou shalt save her, and she shall journey with thee, and I deem that children shall be given unto thee of her." And when Tobias heard these things, he grew fond of her, and his soul was exceedingly knit unto her. And they came unto Ecbatana.

### CHAPTER 7

[Tobit 7:1]
And they came unto the house of Raguel. And Sarah met them, and she greeted them, and they [likewise] greeted her; and she led them into the house.

[Tobit 7:2]
Then said Raguel unto Edna his wife, "How like is this young man unto Tobit, my kinsman!"

[Tobit 7:3]
And Raguel asked them, saying, "Whence are ye, brethren?" And they answered him, "We are of the sons of Naphtali, of the captives who dwell in Nineveh."

[Tobit 7:4]
And he said unto them, "Know ye Tobit, our brother?"

[Tobit 7:5]
And they said, "We know him." And he asked them, "Is he in good health?" And they answered, "He doth both live, and is in good health."

[Tobit 7:6]
Then said Tobias, "He is my father."

[Tobit 7:7]
And Raguel leaped up, and kissed him fervently, and wept, and blessed him, and said unto him, "Thou art the son of a good and virtuous man—"
