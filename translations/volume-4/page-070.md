τοῦ Κυρίου Θεοῦ αὐτῶν τὸ ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ, συναχθῆναι τὸ χρυσίον 14
καὶ τὸ ἀργύριον εἰς ταύρους καὶ κριοὺς καὶ ἄρνας, καὶ τὰ
τούτοις ἀκόλουθα· ὥστε προσενεγκεῖν θυσίας τῷ Κυρίῳ ἐπὶ τὸ 15
θυσιαστήριον τοῦ Θεοῦ αὐτῶν τὸ ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ πάντα ὅσα 16
ἐὰν βούλῃ μετὰ τῶν ἀδελφῶν σου ποιῆσαι χρυσίῳ καὶ ἀργυρίῳ,
ἐπιτέλει κατὰ τὸ θέλημα τοῦ Θεοῦ σου. Καὶ τὰ ἱερὰ σκεύη τοῦ 17
Κυρίου τὰ διδόμενά σοι εἰς τὴν χρείαν τοῦ ἱεροῦ τοῦ Θεοῦ σου τοῦ
ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ· καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ ὅσα ἐὰν ὑποπίπτῃ σοι εἰς τὴν 18
χρείαν τοῦ ἱεροῦ τοῦ Θεοῦ σου, δώσεις ἐκ τοῦ βασιλικοῦ γαζο-
φυλακίου. Κἀγὼ δὲ ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἀρταξέρξης προσέταξα τοῖς γα- 19
ζοφύλαξι Συρίας καὶ Φοινίκης, ἵνα ὅσα ἐὰν ἀποστείλῃ Ἔζρας ὁ
ἱερεὺς καὶ ἀναγνώστης τοῦ νόμου τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ ὑψίστου, ἐπιμε-
λῶς διδῶσιν αὐτῷ ἕως ἀργυρίου ταλάντων ἑκατὸν, ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ 20
ἕως πυροῦ κόρων ἑκατὸν, καὶ οἴνου μετρητῶν ἑκατὸν· καὶ ἄλλα 21
ἐκ πλήθους πάντα κατὰ τὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ νόμον ἐπιτελεσθήτω ἐπι-
μελῶς τῷ Θεῷ τῷ ὑψίστῳ, ἕνεκεν τοῦ μὴ γενέσθαι ὀργὴν ἐπὶ
τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ὑμῖν δὲ 22
λέγεται, ὅπως πᾶσι τοῖς ἱερεῦσι, καὶ τοῖς Λευΐταις, καὶ τοῖς ἱε-
ροψάλταις, καὶ θυρωροῖς, καὶ ἱεροδούλοις, καὶ πραγματικοῖς τοῦ
ἱεροῦ τούτου μηδεμία φορολογία, μηδὲ ἄλλη ἐπιβολὴ γίγνηται,
καὶ ἐξουσίαν μηδένα ἔχειν ἐπιβάλλειν τι τούτοις. Καὶ σὺ, Ἔζρα, 23
κατὰ τὴν σοφίαν τοῦ Θεοῦ, ἀνάδειξον κριτὰς καὶ δικαστὰς, ὅπως
δικάζωσιν ἐν ὅλῃ Συρίᾳ καὶ Φοινίκῃ, πάντας τοὺς ἐπισταμένους
τὸν νόμον τοῦ Θεοῦ σου, καὶ τοὺς μὴ ἐπισταμένους δὲ διδάξεις.
Καὶ πάντες ὅσοι ἐὰν παραβαίνωσι τὸν νόμον τοῦ Θεοῦ σου καὶ 24
τὸν βασιλικὸν, ἐπιμελῶς κολασθήσονται, ἐάν τε καὶ θανάτῳ, ἐάν
τε καὶ τιμωρίᾳ, ἢ ἀργυρικῇ ζημίᾳ, ἢ ἀπαγωγῇ. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἔζρας 25
ὁ γραμματεὺς εὐλογητὸς μόνος ὁ Κύριος τῶν πατέρων μου, ὁ
δοὺς ταῦτα εἰς τὴν καρδίαν τοῦ βασιλέως, δοξάσαι τὸν οἶκον αὐ-
τοῦ τὸν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ ἐμὲ ἐτίμησεν ἐναντίον τοῦ βασιλέως, 26
καὶ τῶν συμβουλευόντων, καὶ πάντων τῶν φίλων, καὶ μεγιστά-
νων αὐτοῦ. Κἀγὼ εὐθαρσὴς ἐγενόμην κατὰ τὴν ἀντίληψιν Κυρίου 27
τοῦ Θεοῦ μου, καὶ συνήγαγον ἐκ τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ ἄνδρας, ὥστε συ-
ναναβῆναί μοι. Καὶ οὗτοι οἱ προηγούμενοι κατὰ τὰς πατριὰς αὐ- 28
τῶν καὶ τὰς μεριδαρχίας, οἱ ἀναβάντες μετ᾽ ἐμοῦ ἐκ Βαβυλῶ-
νος ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ Ἀρταξέρξου τοῦ βασιλέως. Ἐκ τῶν υἱῶν

**15** so that ye may offer sacrifices unto the Lord upon the altar of their God which is in Jerusalem.
**16** And whatsoever thou shalt choose to do with the gold and with the silver, with thy brethren, that do thou accomplish according to the will of thy God.
**17** And the holy vessels of the Lord, which are given unto thee for the service of the Temple of thy God which is in Jerusalem;

**19** And I, Artaxerxes the king, have commanded the treasurers of Syria and Phoenicia, that whatsoever Ezra, the priest and reader of the Law of the Most High God, shall send unto them, they should diligently give unto him,
**20** even unto one hundred talents of silver, and likewise even unto one hundred cors of wheat, and one hundred baths of wine;
**21** and all other things, according to the Law of God, in full measure, let them be diligently accomplished for the Most High God, lest there be wrath upon the kingdom of the king and of his sons.

**23** And thou, Ezra, according to the wisdom of God, appoint thou judges and magistrates, that they may judge in all Syria and Phoenicia, even all those who know the Law of thy God; and those who know it not, shalt thou teach.
**24** And all whosoever shall transgress the Law of thy God and the king's law, they shall be diligently punished, whether it be by death, or by scourging, or by monetary penalty, or by banishment.
**25** And Ezra the scribe said, Blessed alone be the Lord of my fathers, Who hath put such a thing into the heart of the king, to glorify His house which is in Jerusalem.
**26** And hath honored me before the king, and his counselors, and all his friends, and his chief men.
**27** And I was emboldened according to the help of the Lord my God, and I gathered men from Israel, to go up with me.
