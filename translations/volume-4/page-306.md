**ΚΕΦ. ΛΘʹ. Μʹ.**

ὁδοὶ αὐτοῦ τοῖς ὁσίοις εὐθεῖαι, οὕτως τοῖς ἀνόμοις προσκόμματα.
Ἀγαθὰ τοῖς ἀγαθοῖς ἔκτισται ἀπ᾿ ἀρχῆς, οὕτως τοῖς ἁμαρτωλοῖς 25
κακά. Ἀρχὴ πάσης χρείας εἰς ζωὴν ἀνθρώπου, ὕδωρ, καὶ πῦρ, 26
καὶ σίδηρος, καὶ ἅλας, καὶ σεμίδαλις πυροῦ, καὶ μέλι, καὶ γάλα,
αἷμα σταφυλῆς, καὶ ἔλαιον, καὶ ἱμάτιον· ταῦτα πάντα τοῖς εὐ- 27
σεβέσιν εἰς ἀγαθά, οὕτως τοῖς ἁμαρτωλοῖς τραπήσεται εἰς κακά.
Ἔστι πνεύματα ἃ εἰς ἐκδίκησιν ἔκτισται, καὶ ἐν θυμῷ αὐτῶν 28
ἐστερέωσαν μάστιγας αὑτῶν· ἐν καιρῷ συντελείας ἰσχὺν ἐκχέουσι,
καὶ τὸν θυμὸν τοῦ ποιήσαντος αὐτοὺς κοπάσουσιν. Πῦρ καὶ χά- 29
λαζα καὶ λιμὸς καὶ θάνατος, πάντα ταῦτα εἰς ἐκδίκησιν ἔκτι-
σται· θηρίων ὀδόντες καὶ σκορπίοι καὶ ὄφεις, καὶ ῥομφαία ἐκδικοῦσα 30
εἰς ὄλεθρον ἀσεβεῖς, ἐν τῇ ἐντολῇ αὐτοῦ εὐφρανθήσονται, καὶ ἐπὶ 31
τῆς γῆς εἰς χρείας ἑτοιμασθήσονται, καὶ ἐν καιροῖς αὐτῶν οὐ πα-
ραβήσονται λόγον. Διὰ τοῦτο ἐξ ἀρχῆς ἐστήριχθην, καὶ διενοή- 32
θην, καὶ ἐν γραφῇ ἀφῆκα. Τὰ ἔργα Κυρίου πάντα ἀγαθά, καὶ 33
πᾶσαν χρείαν ἐν ὥρᾳ αὐτῆς χορηγήσει· καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν εἰπεῖν· τοῦτο 34
τούτου πονηρότερον· πάντα γὰρ ἐν καιρῷ εὐδοκιμήσεται. Καὶ νῦν 35
ἐν πάσῃ καρδίᾳ καὶ στόματι ὑμνήσατε, καὶ εὐλογήσατε τὸ ὄνομα
Κυρίου.

**ΚΕΦ. Μʹ. XL.**

ἈΣΧΟΛΙΑ μεγάλη ἔκτισται παντὶ ἀνθρώπῳ, καὶ ζυγὸς βαρὺς 1
ἐπὶ υἱοὺς Ἀδάμ, ἀφ᾿ ἡμέρας ἐξόδου ἐκ γαστρὸς μητρὸς αὐτῶν
ἕως ἡμέρας ἐπιστροφῆς εἰς μητέρα πάντων· διὰ λογισμοὺς αὐτῶν 2
καὶ φόβον καρδίας ἐπίνοια προσδοκίας ἡμέρας τελευτῆς, ἀπὸ κα- 3
θημένου ἐπὶ θρόνου ἐν δόξῃ καὶ ἕως τεταπεινωμένου ἐν γῇ καὶ σπο-
δοῦ, ἀπὸ φοροῦντος ὑάκινθον καὶ στέφανον καὶ ἕως περιβαλλομένου 4
ὡμόλινον· θυμὸς καὶ ζῆλος καὶ ταραχὴ καὶ σάλος, καὶ φόβος 5
θανάτου καὶ μνήμη καὶ ἔρις· καὶ ἐν καιρῷ ἀναπαύσεως ἐπὶ κοίτης
ὕπνος νυκτὸς ἀλλοιοῖ γνῶσιν αὐτοῦ· ὀλίγον ὡς οὐδὲν ἐν ἀναπαύσει, 6
καὶ ἀπ᾿ ἐκείνου ἐν ὕπνοις ὡς ἐν ἡμέρᾳ σκοπιᾶς, τεθορυβημένος ἐν
δράσει καρδίας αὐτοῦ, ὡς ἐκπεφυγὼς ἀπὸ προσώπου πολέμου· ἐν 7
καιρῷ σωτηρίας αὐτοῦ ἐξηγέρθη, καὶ ἀποθαυμάζων εἰς οὐδένα
φόβον. Μετὰ πάσης σαρκὸς ἀπὸ ἀνθρώπου ἕως κτήνους, καὶ ἐπὶ 8
ἁμαρτωλῶν ἑπταπλάσια πρὸς ταῦτα· θάνατος καὶ αἷμα καὶ ἔρις 9

**Chapter Thirty-Nine**

His ways are straight unto the holy, so unto the lawless are they stumbling blocks.
25 Good things were created from the beginning for the good, so for sinners were evil things [created].
26 The beginning of every need for the life of man is water, and fire, and iron, and salt, and fine flour of wheat, and honey, and milk,
27 the blood of the grape, and oil, and clothing; all these things are for good unto the pious, so shall they turn unto evil for sinners.
28 There are spirits that were created for vengeance, and in their wrath have they made firm their scourges; in the time of the end shall they pour forth [their] strength, and shall appease the wrath of Him that made them.
29 Fire and hail and famine and death, all these things were created for vengeance;
30 the teeth of wild beasts, and scorpions, and serpents, and the avenging sword for the destruction of the ungodly,
31 in His commandment shall they rejoice, and upon the earth for [their appointed] needs shall they be prepared, and in their due seasons shall they not transgress a word.
32 For this cause was I established from the beginning, and I meditated, and in writing have I left [it].
33 All the works of the Lord are good, and every need in its [proper] season shall He provide.
34 And it is not for one to say: "This is worse than that," for all things in their due season shall be found good.
35 And now, with every heart and mouth, sing ye praise, and bless the Name of the Lord.

**Chapter Forty**

1 Great toil hath been created for every man, and a heavy yoke upon the sons of Adam, from the day of their coming forth from their mother's womb until the day of their return unto the mother of all.
2 For through their thoughts and the fear of their heart cometh the expectation of the day of death;
3 from him that sitteth upon a throne in glory, even unto him that is brought low in the earth and in ashes;
4 from him that weareth hyacinth and a crown, even unto him that is clad in coarse linen.
5 Wrath and jealousy, and trouble and disquietude, and the fear of death, and memory, and strife;
6 and in the time of rest upon his couch, the sleep of night doth alter his understanding. Little it is, as naught in his repose,
7 and from that [time], in his dreams, as in a day of watch, troubled in the vision of his heart, as one that hath escaped from the face of war. In the time of his deliverance was he awakened, and marvelling [that there was now] no fear.
8 [These things are] with all flesh, from man even unto beast, and upon sinners are they sevenfold more than these:
9 death, and bloodshed, and strife,
