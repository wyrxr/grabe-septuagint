ΚΕΦ. Ηʹ. VIII.

1 ΚΑΙ μεταγενέστερος τούτων ἐστὶ, βασιλεύοντος Ἀρταξέρξου
τοῦ Περσῶν βασιλέως, προσέβη Ἔζρας Σαρχίου τοῦ Ἐξερίου,
2 τοῦ Χελκίου, τοῦ Σαλήμου, τοῦ Σαδδούκου, τοῦ Ἀχιτὼβ, τοῦ
Ἀμαρίου, τοῦ Ἑζίου, τοῦ Μαρερὼθ, τοῦ Ζαρχίου, τοῦ Σαουία,
3 τοῦ Βοκκὰ, τοῦ Ἀβίσουαΐ, τοῦ Φινεὲς, τοῦ Ἐλεάζαρ, τοῦ Ἀα-
ρὼν τοῦ ἱερέως τοῦ πρώτου. Οὗτος Ἔζρας ἀνέβη ἐκ Βαβυλῶ-
4 νος ὡς γραμματεὺς εὐφυὴς ὢν ἐν τῷ νόμῳ Μωϋσέως τῷ ἐκδε-
δομένῳ ὑπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ ὁ βασιλεὺς
δόξαν, εὑρόντος χάριν ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ πάντα τὰ ἀξιώματα
5 αὐτοῦ. Καὶ συναπεβέησαν ἐκ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ τῶν ἱερέων,
καὶ Λευϊτῶν, καὶ ἱεροψαλτῶν, καὶ θυρωρῶν, καὶ ἱεροδούλων εἰς
6 Ἱεροσόλυμα, ἔτους ἑβδόμου βασιλεύοντος Ἀρταξέρξου ἐν τῷ πέμ-
πτῳ μηνί· οὗτος ὁ ἐνιαυτὸς ἕβδομος τῷ βασιλεῖ. ἐξελθόντες γὰρ
ἐκ Βαβυλῶνος τῇ νουμηνίᾳ τοῦ πρώτου μηνὸς, ἐν τῇ νουμηνίᾳ
τοῦ πέμπτου μηνὸς παρεγένοντο εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα κατὰ τὴν δο-
7 θεῖσαν αὐτοῖς εὐοδίαν παρὰ τοῦ Κυρίου ἐπ᾽ αὐτῷ. Ὁ γὰρ Ἔζρας
πολλὴν ἐπιστήμην περιεῖχεν εἰς τὸ μηδὲν παραλιπεῖν τῶν ἐκ τοῦ
νόμου Κυρίου καὶ τῶν ἐντολῶν, διδάξαι τὸν πάντα Ἰσραὴλ πάν-
8 τα τὰ δικαιώματα καὶ τὰ κρίματα. Προσπεσόντος δὲ τοῦ γρα-
φέντος προστάγματος παρὰ Ἀρταξέρξου τοῦ βασιλέως πρὸς Ἔζ-
ραν τὸν ἱερέα καὶ ἀναγνώστην τοῦ νόμου Κυρίου, οὗ ἐστιν ἀντί-
9 γραφον τὸ ὑποκείμενον. Βασιλεὺς Ἀρταξέρξης Ἔζρα τῷ ἱερεῖ
καὶ ἀναγνώστῃ τοῦ νόμου Κυρίου χαίρειν. Καὶ τὰ φιλάνθρωπα
10 ἐγὼ κρίνας, προσέταξα τοὺς βουλομένους ἐκ τοῦ ἔθνους τῶν Ἰου-
δαίων αἱρετίζοντας, καὶ τῶν ἱερέων, καὶ τῶν Λευϊτῶν, τῶνδε ἐν
11 τῇ ἡμετέρᾳ βασιλείᾳ συμπορεύεσθαί σοι εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ. Ὅσοι
οὖν ἐνθυμοῦνται, συνεξορμάσθωσαν, καθάπερ δίδονται ἐμοί τε καὶ
12 τοῖς ἑπτὰ φίλοις συμβουλευταῖς· ὅπως ἐπισκέψωνται τὰ κατὰ τὴν
Ἰουδαίαν καὶ Ἱερουσαλὴμ, ἀκολούθως ὡς ἔχει ἐν τῷ νόμῳ τοῦ
13 Κυρίου· καὶ ἀπενεγκεῖν δῶρα τῷ Κυρίῳ τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ, ἃ ηὐξά-
μην ἐγώ τε καὶ οἱ φίλοι εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ· καὶ πᾶν χρυσίον καὶ
ἀργύριον ὃ ἐὰν εὑρεθῇ ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ τῆς Βαβυλωνίας τῷ Κυρίῳ
εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ, σὺν τῷ δεδωρημένῳ ὑπὸ τοῦ ἔθνους εἰς τὸ ἱερὸν

**Chapter 8**

**1** AND it came to pass, after these things, when Artaxerxes, the king of the Persians, did reign, that Ezra, the son of Sarchius, the son of Ezri,
**2** the son of Helchiah, the son of Salemus, the son of Sadduc, the son of Ahitob, the son of Amariah, the son of Hezias, the son of Mareroth, the son of Zarchias, the son of Sauia,
**3** the son of Boccas, the son of Abisue, the son of Phinees, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the priest, the first, did come up.
**4** This Ezra came up from Babylon, being a skillful scribe in the Law of Moses which was given forth by the God of Israel. And the king did grant him glory, he having found favour before him in all his requests.
**5** And there went up with him from among the children of Israel, and of the priests, and Levites, and temple-singers, and doorkeepers, and temple-servants, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of the reign of Artaxerxes, in the fifth month;
**6** this same year was the seventh unto the king. For they, having departed from Babylon on the new moon of the first month, did arrive at Jerusalem on the new moon of the fifth month, according to the good journey which was given unto them by the Lord upon him.
**7** For Ezra had great knowledge, so that he might omit nothing of [that which is] from the Law of the Lord and of the commandments, [but might] teach all Israel all the statutes and the judgments.
**8** Now when the written decree from Artaxerxes the king had been delivered unto Ezra the priest and reader of the Law of the Lord, whereof the copy is here subjoined:
**9** "King Artaxerxes unto Ezra, the priest and reader of the Law of the Lord, sendeth greetings.
**10** And I, having judged [it meet to perform] benevolent deeds, have commanded that those from the nation of the Jews who are willing and do choose, both of the priests and of the Levites, even these who are in our kingdom, should go up with thee unto Jerusalem.
**11** Therefore, as many as do purpose [in their heart], let them set forth together, according as [offerings] are presented by me and by my seven friends, the counselors;
**12** so that they may inquire into the matters concerning Judea and Jerusalem, according as it is written in the Law of the Lord;
**13** and to bring gifts unto the Lord of Israel, which I and my friends have vowed unto Jerusalem; and all gold and silver which may be found in the land of Babylonia for the Lord unto Jerusalem, together with that which hath been freely offered by the nation for the Temple"
