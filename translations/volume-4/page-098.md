πολλὰς, καὶ ἐποίησαν μηχανὰς, καὶ ἐξῆλθον, καὶ ἐνεπύρισαν αὐ-
τὰς ἐν πυρὶ, καὶ ἐπολέμησαν ἀνδρωδῶς. Καὶ ἀπῆρεν Ἰούδας ἀπὸ 32
τῆς ἄκρας, καὶ παρενέβαλεν εἰς Βαιθζαχαρία ἀπέναντι τῆς παρ-
εμβολῆς τοῦ βασιλέως. Καὶ ὤρθρισεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τὸ πρωΐ, καὶ ἀ- 33
πῆρε τὴν παρεμβολὴν ἐν ὁρμήματι αὐτῆς κατὰ τὴν ὁδὸν Βαιθζα-
χαρία, καὶ διεσκεδάσθησαν αἱ δυνάμεις εἰς τὸν πόλεμον, καὶ ἐσάλ-
πισαν ταῖς σάλπιγξι. Καὶ τοῖς ἐλέφασιν ἔδειξαν αἷμα σταφυλῆς 34
καὶ μόρων, τοῦ παραστῆσαι αὐτοὺς εἰς τὸν πόλεμον. Καὶ διῆλθον 35
τὰ θηρία εἰς τὰς φάλαγγας, καὶ παρέστησαν ἐφ’ ἑκάστῳ ἐλέφαντι
χιλίους ἄνδρας τεθωρακισμένους ἐν ἁλυσιδωτοῖς, καὶ περικεφα-
λαῖαι χαλκαῖ ἐπὶ τῶν κεφαλῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ πεντακοσία ἵππος δια-
τεταγμένη ἑκάστῳ θηρίῳ ἐκλελεγμένη. Οὗτοι πρὸ καιροῦ, εὖ ἂν ᾖ τὸ 36
θηρίον, ἦσαν, καὶ οὐκ ἐπορεύετο, ἐπορεύοντο ἅμα, οὐκ ἀφίσταντο
ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ πύργοι ξύλινοι ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς ὀχυροὶ σκεπαζόμενοι 37
ἐφ’ ἑκάστου θηρίου ἐζωσμένοι ἐπ’ αὐτοῦ μηχαναῖς, καὶ ἐφ’ ἑκάστου
ἄνδρες δυνάμεως δύο καὶ τριάκοντα οἱ πολεμοῦντες ἐπ’ αὐτοῖς,
καὶ ὁ Ἰνδὸς αὐτοῦ. Καὶ τὴν ἐπίλοιπον ἵππον ἔνθεν καὶ ἔνθεν 38
ἔστησαν ἐπὶ τὰ δύο μέρη τῆς παρεμβολῆς κατασείοντες καὶ κα-
ταφρασσόμενοι ἐν ταῖς φάλαγξιν. Ὡς δὲ ἔστιλβεν ὁ ἥλιος ἐπὶ 39
τὰς χρυσᾶς καὶ χαλκᾶς ἀσπίδας, ἔστιλβεν ἐπ’ αὐτῶν, καὶ κα-
τηύγαζεν, ὡς λαμπάδες πυρός. Καὶ ἐξετάθη μέρος τι τῆς πα- 40
ρεμβολῆς τοῦ βασιλέως ἐπὶ τὰ ὑψηλὰ ὄρη, καὶ τινες ἐπὶ τὰ τα-
πεινὰ, καὶ ἤρχοντο ἀσφαλῶς καὶ τεταγμένως. Καὶ ἐσαλεύοντο 41
πάντες οἱ ἀκούοντες φωνῆς πλήθους αὐτῶν καὶ ὁδοιπορίας τοῦ
πλήθους καὶ συγκρουσμοῦ τῶν ὅπλων· ἦν γὰρ ἡ παρεμβολὴ με-
γάλη σφόδρα καὶ ἰσχυρά. Καὶ ἤγγισεν Ἰούδας καὶ ἡ παρεμβο- 42
λὴ αὐτοῦ εἰς παράταξιν, καὶ ἔπεσαν ἀπὸ τῆς παρεμβολῆς τοῦ
βασιλέως ἑξακόσιοι ἄνδρες. Καὶ εἶδεν Ἐλεάζαρ ὁ Σαυαρὰν ἕνα 43
τῶν θηρίων τεθωρακισμένον θώραξι βασιλικοῖς, καὶ ἦν ὑπεράγον
πάντα τὰ θηρία, καὶ ὤφθη ὅτι ἐν αὐτῷ ἐστιν ὁ βασιλεύς. Καὶ 44
ἔδωκεν ἑαυτὸν τοῦ σῶσαι τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ περιποιήσαι αὐ-
τῷ ὄνομα αἰώνιον. Καὶ ἐπέδραμεν αὐτῷ θράσει εἰς μέσον τῆς 45
φάλαγγος, καὶ ἐθανάτου δεξιὰ καὶ εὐώνυμα, καὶ ἐσχίζοντο ἀπ’
αὐτοῦ ἔνθα καὶ ἔνθα. Καὶ εἰσέδυ ὑπὸ τὸν ἐλέφαντα, καὶ ἀπέ- 46
σφαξεν αὐτόν, καὶ ἀνεῖλεν αὐτὸν, καὶ ἔπεσεν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ἐπάνω
αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀπέθανεν ἐκεῖ. Καὶ εἶδον τὴν ἰσχὺν τῆς βασιλείας 47

**31** ...many [days]; and they made engines of war, and they sallied forth, and burned them with fire, and fought courageously.
**32** And Judas departed from the citadel, and pitched his camp in Beth-zachariah, over against the king's camp.
**33** And the king rose up early in the morning, and moved his camp with great haste along the way to Beth-zachariah, and the forces were arrayed for battle, and they blew with the trumpets.
**34** And unto the elephants they showed the blood of grapes and of mulberries, to incite them unto battle.
**35** And the beasts passed into the ranks, and there were set upon each elephant a thousand men clad in mail, and brazen helmets upon their heads, and five hundred chosen cavalry arrayed for each beast.
**36** These men were ever in readiness, and if the beast were sound, it moved not save they moved with it, nor did they depart from it.
**37** And strong wooden towers, covered, were upon them, girded upon each beast with engines, and upon each [tower were] two and thirty mighty men who fought upon them, and the Indian thereof.
**38** And the rest of the cavalry they placed on either side, at the two parts of the camp, brandishing [their weapons] and guarding [themselves] within the ranks.
**39** And as the sun shone upon the shields of gold and brass, it shone upon them, and gleamed brightly, as lamps of fire.
**40** And a part of the king's camp was extended upon the high mountains, and some upon the low places, and they came on securely and in good order.
**41** And all they that heard the sound of their multitude were shaken, and the tramp of the multitude, and the clash of arms; for the camp was exceeding great and mighty.
**42** And Judas and his camp drew nigh to array for battle, and there fell from the king's camp six hundred men.
**43** And Eleazar, surnamed Savaran, saw one of the beasts armoured with royal breastplates, and it did excel all the beasts, and it appeared that the king was in it.
**44** And he gave himself to save his people, and to gain for himself an everlasting name.
**45** And he ran at it boldly into the midst of the phalanx, and he slew [men] right and left, and they were parted from him hither and thither.
**46** And he crept under the elephant, and he slew it, and he brought it low, and it fell to the earth upon him, and he died there.
**47** And they beheld the might of the kingdom,
