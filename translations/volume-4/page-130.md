**ΚΕΦ. ΙΕ΄. ΜΑΚΚΑΒΑΙΩΝ Α΄. 166**
ἔθνει Ἰουδαίων χαίρειν. Ἐπειδὴ τινες λοιμοὶ κατεκράτησαν τῆς
3 βασιλείας, τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν, βουλεύομαι δὲ ἀντιποιήσασθαι τῆς
βασιλείας, ὅπως ἀποκαταστήσω αὐτὴν ὡς ἦν τὸ πρότερον· ἐξενολό-
4 γησα δὲ πλῆθος δυνάμεων καὶ κατεσκεύασα πλοῖα πολεμικά. Βού-
λομαι δ᾽ ἐκβῆναι κατὰ τὴν χώραν, ὅπως μετέλθω τοὺς κατεφθαρ-
κότας τὴν χώραν ἡμῶν καὶ τοὺς ἠρημωκότας πόλεις πολλά, ἐν τῇ
βασιλείᾳ. Νῦν οὖν ἵστημί σοι πάντα τὰ ἀφαιρέματα, ἃ ἀφῆκαν
5 σοι οἱ πρὸ ἐμοῦ βασιλεῖς, καὶ ὅσα ἄλλα δόματα ἀφῆκαν σοι. Καὶ
6 ἐπέτρεψά σοι ποιῆσαι κόμμα ἴδιον νόμισμα τῆς χώρας σου. Ἱε-
7 ρουσαλὴμ δὲ καὶ τὰ ἅγια εἶναι ἐλεύθερα· καὶ πάντα τὰ ὅπλα, ὅσα
κατεσκεύασας, καὶ τὰ ὀχυρώματα, ἃ ᾠκοδόμησας, ὧν κρατεῖς με-
νέτω σοι. Καὶ πᾶν ὀφείλημα βασιλικὸν καὶ τὰ ἐσόμένα βασιλικά,
8 ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν καὶ εἰς τὸν ἅπαντα χρόνον ἀφιέσθω σοι. Ὡς δ᾽ ἂν
9 καταστήσωμεν τὴν βασιλείαν ἡμῶν, δοξάσωμέν σε καὶ τὸ ἔθνος
σου καὶ τὸ ἱερὸν δόξῃ μεγάλῃ, ὥστε φανερὰν γενέσθαι τὴν δόξαν
ὑμῶν ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ. Ἔτους τετάρτου καὶ ἑβδομηκοστοῦ καὶ ἑκα-
10 τοστοῦ ἐξῆλθεν Ἀντίοχος εἰς τὴν γῆν τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ, καὶ συ-
νῆλθον πρὸς αὐτὸν πᾶσαι αἱ δυνάμεῖς, ὥστε ὀλίγους εἶναι τοὺς
καταλειφθέντας σὺν Τρύφωνι. Καὶ ἐδίωξεν αὐτὸν Ἀντίοχος ὁ βα-
11 σιλεύς, καὶ ἦλθε φεύγων εἰς Δωρᾶ τὴν ἐπὶ τὴν θάλασσαν. Ἤδει
12 γὰρ ὅτι ἐπισυνῆκται ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸν κακά, καὶ ἀφῆκαν αὐτὸν αἱ δυνά-
μεις. Καὶ παρενέβαλεν Ἀντίοχος ἐπὶ Δωρᾶ, καὶ σὺν αὐτῷ δώδε-
13 κα μυριάδες ἀνδρῶν πολεμιστῶν καὶ ὀκτακισχίλια ἵππος. Καὶ ἐ-
14 κύκλωσε τὴν πόλιν, καὶ τὰ πλοῖα ἀπὸ θαλάσσης συνῆψαν, καὶ συ-
νέθλιβε τὴν πόλιν ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς θαλάσσης, καὶ οὐκ εἴ-
ασεν οὐδένα ἐκπορεύεσθαι καὶ εἰσπορεύεσθαι. Καὶ ἦλθε Νουμήνιος
15 καὶ οἱ παρ᾽ αὐτοῦ ἐκ Ῥώμης ἔχοντες ἐπιστολὰς τοῖς βασιλεῦσι
καὶ ταῖς χώραις, ἐν αἷς ἐγέγραπτο τάδε· Λεύκιος ὕπατος Ῥωμαίων
Πτολεμαίῳ βασιλεῖ χαίρειν. Οἱ πρεσβευταὶ τῶν Ἰουδαίων ἦλ-
16 θον πρὸς ἡμᾶς φίλοι ἡμῶν καὶ σύμμαχοι, ἀνανεούμενοι τὴν ἐξ ἀρ-
χῆς φιλίαν καὶ συμμαχίαν, ἀπεσταλμένοι ἀπὸ Σίμωνος τοῦ ἀρχι-
ερέως καὶ τοῦ δήμου τῶν Ἰουδαίων. Ἤνεγκαν δὲ ἀσπίδα χρυσῆν
17 ἀπὸ μνῶν πεντακισχιλίων. Ἤρεσεν οὖν ἡμῖν γράψαι τοῖς βασιλεῦ-
18 σι καὶ ταῖς χώραις, ὅπως μὴ ἐζητήσωσιν αὐτοῖς κακά, καὶ μὴ
πολεμήσωσιν αὐτοὺς καὶ τὰς πόλεις αὐτῶν καὶ τὴν χώραν αὐτῶν,
καὶ ἵνα μὴ συμμαχήσωσι τοῖς πολεμοῦσιν αὐτούς. Ἔδοξε δὲ ἡ-
19 μῖν δέξασθαι τὴν ἀσπίδα παρ᾿ αὐτῶν.

**Chapter 15**

**2** ...unto the nation of the Jews, greeting.
**3** Forasmuch as certain pestilent men have laid hold upon the kingdom of our fathers, I purpose therefore to recover the kingdom, that I may restore it as it was before.
**4** And I have gathered a multitude of forces and prepared warships. Now it is my will to go forth into the country, that I may take vengeance on them that have corrupted our land, and them that have laid waste many cities in the kingdom.
**5** Now therefore, I confirm unto thee all the remissions which the kings before me did grant unto thee, and whatsoever other gifts they did grant unto thee.
**6** And I have given thee leave to strike thine own coin for thy country.
**7** And Jerusalem and the holy [places] shall be free; and all the weapons which thou hast prepared, and the strongholds which thou hast built, whereof thou art possessed, let them remain unto thee.
**8** And every royal debt, and all that which shall accrue unto the king hereafter, from this time forth and forevermore, shall be remitted unto thee.
**9** And when we shall have established our kingdom, we will glorify thee, and thy nation, and the Temple with great glory, so that your glory shall be manifest in all the earth.

**10** In the hundred seventy and fourth year, did Antiochus come forth into the land of his fathers, and all the forces did gather unto him, insomuch that there were but few left with Tryphon.
**11** And Antiochus the king did pursue him, and he fled and came unto Dora, which is by the sea.
**12** For he knew that evils had gathered upon him, and that the forces had forsaken him.
**13** And Antiochus did encamp against Dora, and with him were an hundred and twenty thousand men of war and eight thousand horse.
**14** And he did compass about the city, and the ships from the sea did join [the siege], and he did oppress the city from the land and from the sea, and suffered no man to go forth or to enter in.

**15** And Numenius came, and they that were with him from Rome, having letters unto the kings and countries, wherein were written these things: "Lucius, the consul of the Romans, unto King Ptolemy, greeting."
**16** The ambassadors of the Jews came unto us, our friends and confederates, renewing the friendship and league that was from the beginning, being sent from Simon the high priest and the people of the Jews.
**17** And they brought a golden shield of five thousand minas.
**18** It hath seemed good unto us therefore to write unto the kings and countries, that they should not seek hurt against them, nor make war upon them, nor their cities, nor their country, and that they should not be confederates with them that make war against them.
**19** Moreover, it hath seemed good unto us to receive the shield from them.
