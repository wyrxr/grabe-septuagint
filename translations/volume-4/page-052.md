προσέχων ῥήμασιν Ἱερεμίου προφήτου ἀλλά 27
συνεστήσατο πρὸς αὐτὸν πόλεμον ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ Μαγεδδὼ.
Καὶ κατέθησαν οἱ ἄρχοντες πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Ἰωσίαν. Καὶ εἶ- 28
πεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τοῖς παισὶν ἑαυτοῦ· ἀποστήσατέ με ἀπὸ τῆς μά-
χης, ἀσθένεια γὰρ λίαν. καὶ εὐθέως ἀπέστησαν αὐτὸν οἱ παῖδες
αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τῆς παρατάξεως. Καὶ ἀνέβη ἐπὶ τὸ ἅρμα τὸ δεύτερον 29
ἑαυτοῦ, καὶ ἀποκατασταθεὶς εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ, μετήλλαξε τὸν βίον
ἑαυτοῦ, καὶ ἐτάφη ἐν τῷ πατρικῷ τάφῳ. Καὶ ἐν ὅλῃ τῇ Ἰουδαίᾳ 30
(καὶ) ἐπένθησαν τὸν Ἰωσίαν, καὶ ἐθρήνησεν Ἱερεμίας ὁ προφήτης
ὑπὲρ Ἰωσίου, καὶ οἱ προκαθήμενοι σὺν γυναιξὶν ἐθρήνουν αὐτὸν ἕ-
ως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης. Καὶ ἐξεδόθη τοῦτο γίνεσθαι ἀεὶ εἰς ἅπαν
τὸ γένος Ἰσραήλ. Ταῦτα δὲ ἀναγέγραπται ἐν τῇ βίβλῳ τῶν ἱστο- 31
ρουμένων περὶ τῶν βασιλέων τῆς Ἰουδαίας, καὶ τὸ καθ’ ἓν πρα-
χθὲν τῆς πράξεως Ἰωσίου, καὶ τῆς δόξης αὐτοῦ, καὶ τῆς συνέσε-
ως αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ νόμῳ τοῦ Κυρίου. τὰ τε προπραχθέντα ὑπ’ αὐ-
τοῦ καὶ τὰ νῦν, ἱστόρηται ἐν τῇ βίβλῳ τῶν βασιλέων Ἰσραὴλ καὶ
Ἰούδα. Καὶ ἀναλαβόντες οἱ ἐκ τοῦ ἔθνους τὸν Ἰωάγαζ υἱὸν Ἰω- 32
σίου, ἀνέδειξαν βασιλέα ἀντὶ Ἰωσίου τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ, ὄντα ἐ-
τῶν εἴκοσι τριῶν. Καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ἰούδα καὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ μῆ- 33
νας τρεῖς· καὶ ἀπέστησεν αὐτὸν βασιλεὺς Αἰγύπτου τοῦ μὴ βα-
σιλεύειν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ ἐζημίωσε τὸ ἔθνος ἀργυρίου ταλάν- 34
τοις ἑκατόν, καὶ χρυσίου ταλάντῳ ἑνί. Καὶ ἀνέδειξε βασιλεὺς 35
Αἰγύπτου βασιλέα Ἰωακεὶμ τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ βασιλέα τῆς Ἰου-
δαίας καὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ ἔδησεν Ἰωακεὶμ καὶ τοὺς μεγιστᾶ- 36
νας, Ζαχάραν δὲ τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ συλλαβὼν ἀνήγαγεν ἐξ Αἰγύ-
πτου. Ἐτῶν δὲ ἦν εἰκοσιπέντε Ἰωακεὶμ, ὅτε ἐβασίλευσε τῆς Ἰου- 37
δαίας καὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ· καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ πονηρὸν ἔναντι Κυρίου. Ἐπ’ 38
αὐτὸν δὲ ἀνέβη Ναβουχοδονόσορ βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος, καὶ δήσας
αὐτὸν ἐν χαλκείῳ δεσμῷ, ἀπήγαγεν εἰς Βαβυλῶνα. καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν 39
ἱερῶν σκευῶν τοῦ Κυρίου λαβὼν Ναβουχοδονόσορ καὶ ἀπενέγκας,
ἀπηρείσατο ἐν τῷ ναῷ ἑαυτοῦ ἐν Βαβυλῶνι. Τὰ δὲ ἱστορηθέντα 40
περὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ τῆς ἀκαθαρσίας αὐτοῦ καὶ δυσσεβείας, ἀναγέγρα-
πται ἐν τῇ βίβλῳ τῶν χρόνων τῶν βασιλέων. Καὶ ἐβασίλευεν 41
ἀντ’ αὐτοῦ Ἰωακεὶμ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ, ὅτε γὰρ ἀνεδείχθη, ἦν ἐτῶν (δέ-
κα) ὀκτώ. Βασιλεύει δὲ μῆνας τρεῖς καὶ ἡμέρας δέκα ἐν Ἱερου- 42
σαλήμ, καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ πονηρὸν ἔναντι Κυρίου. Καὶ μετ’ ἐνιαυτὸν 43
