ἀπωσάμενοι, χοροὺς συνίσταντο εὐφροσύνης εἰρηνικῆς σημείων.
Ὡσαύτως δὲ καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς περὶ τούτων συμπόσιον βαρὺ συνά- 33
γων, ἀδιαλείπτως εἰς οὐρανὸν ἀνθωμολογεῖτο μεγαλομερῶς ἐπὶ
τῇ παραδόξῳ γενηθείσῃ αὐτῶν σωτηρίᾳ. Οἵ τε πρὶν εἰς ὄλε- 34
θρον καὶ οἰωνοφθόρους αὐτοὺς ἔσεσθαι τιθέμενοι, καὶ μετὰ χα-
ρᾶς ἀπογραψάμενοι, κατεστέναζαν αἰσχύνην ἐφ᾽ ἑαυτοῖς περιβα-
λόμενοι, καὶ πυρόπνοον τόλμαν ἀκλεῶς ἐσβεσμένοι. Οἵ τε Ἰου- 35
δαῖοι, καθὼς προειρήκαμεν, συστησάμενοι τὸν προειρημένον χο-
ρόν, μετ᾽ εὐωχίας ἐν ἐξομολογήσεσιν ἱλαραῖς καὶ ψαλμοῖς· διή-
γον. Καὶ κοινὸν ὁρισάμενοι περὶ τούτων θεσμόν, ἐπὶ πᾶσαν 36
τὴν παροικίαν αὐτῶν εἰς γενεάς, τὰς προειρημένας ἡμέρας ἄγειν
ἔστησαν εὐφροσύνους, οὐ πότου χάριν καὶ λιχνείας, σωτηρίας δὲ
τῆς διὰ Θεὸν γενομένης αὐτοῖς. Ἐνέτυχον δὲ τῷ βασιλεῖ, τὴν 37
ἀπόλυσιν αὐτῶν εἰς τὰ ἴδια αἰτούμενοι. Ἀπογράφονται δὲ αὐ- 38
τοὺς ἀπὸ πέμπτης καὶ εἰκάδος τοῦ Παχὼν ἕως τῆς τετάρτης τοῦ
Ἐπιφί, ἐπὶ ἡμέρας τεσσαράκοντα· συνίστανται δὲ αὐτῶν τὴν ἀ-
πώλειαν ἀπὸ πέμπτης τοῦ Ἐπιφὶ ἕως ἑβδόμης, ἡμέραις τρισίν.
Ἐν αἷς καὶ μεγαλοδόξως ἐπιφανὴς τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ ὁ τῶν πάν- 39
των δυνάστης, ἀπταίστους αὐτοὺς ἐῤῥύσατο ὁμοθυμαδόν. Εὐω- 40
χοῦντο δὲ πάνθ᾽ ὑπὸ τοῦ βασιλέως χορηγούμενοι μέχρι τῆς τεσ-
σαρεσκαιδεκάτης, ἐν ᾗ καὶ τὴν ἐντυχίαν ἐποιήσαντο περὶ τῆς ἀπο-
λύσεως αὐτῶν. Συναινέσας δὲ αὐτοῖς ὁ βασιλεύς, ἔγραψεν αὐ- 41
τοῖς τὴν ὑπογεγραμμένην ἐπιστολὴν πρὸς τοὺς κατὰ πόλιν στρα-
τηγοὺς μεγαλοψύχως τὴν ἐκτενίαν ἔχουσαν.

**III Maccabees, Chapter 7**

**32** ...having cast aside, they set up choruses as tokens of peaceful joy.
**33** Likewise also the king, having gathered a grand banquet concerning these matters, unceasingly gave thanks unto Heaven profusely for the wondrous salvation which had come to them.
**34** And they who before had intended them to be for destruction and for the birds of prey, and had registered them with joy, now groaned, having encompassed themselves with shame; and their fiery boldness was ingloriously quenched.
**35** And the Jews, as we have said before, having set up the aforementioned chorus, continued their feast with cheerful thanksgivings and psalms.
**36** And having ordained a common decree concerning these things for all their dwelling-places, for generations, they appointed to keep the aforementioned days joyfully, not for the sake of drink and gluttony, but of the salvation which had come to them through God.
**37** But they appealed to the king, asking for their release unto their own homes.
**38** And they had been registered from the twenty-fifth of Pachon until the fourth of Epiphi, for forty days; and their destruction was appointed from the fifth of Epiphi until the seventh, for three days.
**39** In which days, and magnificently having manifested His mercy, the Ruler of all, rescued them unharmed, with one accord.
**40** And they were feasting, all things being supplied by the king until the fourteenth [day of Epiphi], on which day also they made their appeal concerning their release.
**41** And the king, having assented unto them, wrote unto them the epistle written below, unto the generals in each city, which bore a magnanimous earnestness.

**Chapter VII**

**1** King Ptolemy Philopator unto the generals throughout Egypt, and unto all those appointed over affairs: Greeting and farewell.
**2** And we ourselves and our children are well, the great God directing our affairs for us, even as we desire.
**3** Certain of our friends, through malice, pressing upon us more frequently, persuaded us to punish the Jews under our kingdom, having gathered their communities, with strange punishments, as [for] apostates;
**4** alleging that our affairs would never be stable, because of the ill-will which these [Jews] bear toward all nations, until this [punishment] be accomplished.
