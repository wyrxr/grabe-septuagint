σιλικοῖς βιβλιοφυλακίοις τοῖς κειμένοις ἐν Βαβυλῶνι, καὶ εὑρέθη
ἐν Ἑκβατάνοις, τῇ βάτει τῇ ἐν Μηδείᾳ χώρᾳ, τόμος εἷς, ἐν ᾧ
23 ὑπεμνημάτιστο τάδε. Ἔτους πρώτου βασιλεύοντος Κύρου, βασι-
λεὺς Κῦρος προσέταξε τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Κυρίου τὸν ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ
24 οἰκοδομῆσαι, ὅπου ἐπιθύουσι διὰ πυρὸς ἐνδελεχοῦς· οὗ τὸ ὕψος
πηχῶν ἑξήκοντα, πλάτος πηχῶν ἑξήκοντα, διὰ δόμων λιθίνων ξυ-
στῶν τριῶν, καὶ δόμου ξυλίνου ἐγχωρίου καινοῦ ἑνός, καὶ τὸ
25 δαπάνημα δοθῆναι ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου Κύρου τοῦ βασιλέως. Καὶ τὰ
ἱερὰ σκεύη τοῦ οἴκου Κυρίου, τὰ χρύσεα καὶ τὰ ἀργύρεα, ἃ ἐξήνεγκε Ναβουχοδονόσορ ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ καὶ ἀπήνεγκεν εἰς Βαβυλῶνα, ἀποκατασταθῆναι εἰς τὸν οἶκον τὸν ἐν
26 Ἱερουσαλήμ, οὗ ἦν κείμενα, ὅπως τεθῇ ἐκεῖ. Προσέταξε δὲ ἐπιμεληθῆναι Σισίννῃ ἐπάρχῳ Συρίας καὶ Φοινίκης, καὶ Σαβραβουζάνῃ, καὶ τοῖς συνεταίροις, καὶ τοῖς ἀποτεταγμένοις ἐν Συρίᾳ καὶ Φοινίκῃ ἡγεμόσιν ἀπέχεσθαι τοῦ τόπου, ἔξεται δὲ τὸν παῖδα τοῦ Κυρίου Ζοροβάβελ, ἔπαρχον δὲ τῆς Ἰουδαίας, καὶ τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους τῶν Ἰουδαίων, τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου ἐκεῖνον οἰκοδομεῖν ἐπὶ
27 τοῦ τόπου. Καὶ ἐγὼ ἐπέταξα ὁλογχερῶς οἰκοδομῆσαι καὶ ἀτενίσαι, ἵνα συμποιῶσι τοῖς ἐκ τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας τῶν Ἰουδαίων, μέχρις τοῦ
28 ἐπιτελεσθῆναι τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Κυρίου. Καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς φορολογίας κοίλης Συρίας καὶ Φοινίκης ἐπιμελῶς σύνταξιν δίδοσθαι τούτοις τοῖς ἀνθρώποις εἰς θυσίας τῷ Κυρίῳ, Ζοροβάβελ ἐπάρχῳ εἰς ταύ-
29 ρους, καὶ κριούς, καὶ ἄρνας, ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ πυρόν, καὶ ἅλα, καὶ οἶνον, καὶ ἔλαιον ἐνδελεχῶς κατ᾽ ἐνιαυτόν, καθὼς ἂν οἱ ἱερεῖς οἱ
30 ἀναμφισθητήτως· ὅπως προσφέρωσι σπονδαὶ τῷ Θεῷ τῷ ὑψίστῳ ὑπὲρ τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ τῶν παίδων, καὶ προσεύχωνται περὶ τῆς
31 αὐτῶν ζωῆς. Καὶ προσέταξεν ἵνα ὅσοι ἂν παραβῶσι τὶ τῶν προειρημένων καὶ τῶν προσγεγραμμένων, ἢ καὶ ἀκυρώσωσι, ληφθῆναι ξῦλον ἐκ τῶν ἰδίων αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπὶ τούτῳ κρεμασθῆναι, καὶ τὰ
32 ὑπάρχοντα αὐτοῦ εἶναι βασιλικά. Διὰ ταῦτα καὶ ὁ Κύριος, οὗ τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ ἐπικέκληται ἐκεῖ, ἀφανίσαι πάντα βασιλέα καὶ ἔθνος, ὃς ἐκτενεῖ τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ κωλῦσαι ἢ κακοποιῆσαι τὸν οἶκον τοῦ
33 Κυρίου ἐκεῖνον τὸν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ. Ἐγὼ βασιλεὺς Δαρεῖος δεδογματίκα ἐπιμελῶς κατὰ ταῦτα γίνεσθαι.

**22** ...royal archives which were kept in Babylon; and there was found in Ecbatana, [which is] in the bramble of the land of Media, one scroll, wherein
**23** these things were recorded: "In the first year of the reign of Cyrus, King Cyrus commanded that the house of the Lord, which is in Jerusalem,
**24** should be built, where they offer sacrifices by continual fire. Whose height shall be sixty cubits, and its breadth sixty cubits; with three courses of hewn stones, and one course of new domestic timber; and the
**25** expense thereof be given from the house of King Cyrus. And the sacred vessels of the house of the Lord, the golden and the silver, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth from the house that was in Jerusalem and carried away unto Babylon, shall be restored unto the house that is in
**26** Jerusalem, where they were kept, that they may be placed there. Moreover, he commanded Sisines the satrap of Syria and Phoenicia, and Sabrabuzanes, and their companions, and the appointed governors in Syria and Phoenicia, to keep away from the place; but the servant of the Lord Zerubbabel, who is the satrap of Judea, and the elders of the Jews, shall go forth to build that house of the Lord upon
**27** that place. And I commanded that they should build with full hand and give heed intently, that they may cooperate with those of the Jews who [returned] from the captivity, until
**28** the house of the Lord be finished. And from the taxation of Coele-Syria and Phoenicia, a contribution shall be diligently given unto these men for sacrifices unto the Lord, [even] unto Zerubbabel the satrap, for bulls,
**29** and rams, and lambs; likewise also wheat, and salt, and wine, and oil continually throughout the year, as the priests [shall determine], unquestionably;
**30** that libations may be offered unto God Most High for the king and for his children, and that they may pray for their
**31** lives. And he commanded that whosoever shall transgress any of the aforementioned things and of those written, or shall annul them, a beam shall be taken from his own [house], and thereon shall he be hanged, and his
**32** possessions shall be [made] royal property. Therefore, also may the Lord, whose Name is invoked there, utterly destroy every king and nation that shall put forth his hand to hinder or to harm that house of the
**33** Lord which is in Jerusalem. I, King Darius, have decreed that these things shall be done diligently according to this."
