**2** σκηνῇ, καὶ Ὁλοφέρνης προπεπτωκὼς ἐπὶ τὴν κλίνην ἑαυτοῦ· ἦν
**3** γὰρ περικεχυμένος αὐτῷ ὁ οἶνος. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰουδὶθ τῇ δούλῃ
    αὐτῆς στῆναι ἔξω τοῦ κοιτῶνος αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐπιτηρεῖν τὴν ἔξοδον
    αὐτῆς καθάπερ καθ’ ἡμέραν· ἐξελεύσεσθαι γὰρ ἔφη ἐπὶ τὴν προ-
    σευχὴν αὐτῆς· καὶ τῷ Βαγώᾳ ἐλάλησε κατὰ τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα.
**4** Καὶ ἀπήλθοσαν πάντες ἐκ προσώπου αὐτῆς, καὶ οὐδεὶς κατελεί-
    φθη ἐν τῷ κοιτῶνι ἀπὸ μικροῦ ἕως μεγάλου. καὶ στᾶσα Ἰουδὶθ
    παρὰ τὴν κλίνην αὐτοῦ, εἶπεν ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτῆς· Κύριε, ὁ Θεὸς
    πάσης δυνάμεως, ἐπίβλεψον ἐν τῇ ὥρᾳ ταύτῃ ἐπὶ τὰ ἔργα τῶν
**5** χειρῶν μου, εἰς ὕψωμα Ἱερουσαλήμ· ὅτι νῦν καιρὸς ἀντιλαβέσθαι
    τῆς κληρονομίας σου, καὶ ποιῆσαι τὸ ἐπιτήδευμά μου, εἰς θραῦ-
**6** σμα ἐχθρῶν οἳ ἐπανάστησαν ἡμῖν. Καὶ προσελθοῦσα τῷ κανόνι
    τῆς κλίνης δὲ ἦν πρὸς κεφαλῆς Ὁλοφέρνου, καθεῖλε τὸν ἀχινά-
**7** κην αὐτοῦ ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐγγίσασα τῆς κλίνης, ἐδράξατο τῆς κό-
    μης τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπε· κραταίωσόν με, Κύριε ὁ Θεὸς
**8** Ἰσραήλ, ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ταύτῃ. Καὶ ἐπάταξεν εἰς τὸν τράχηλον
    αὐτοῦ δὶς ἐν τῇ ἰσχύϊ αὐτῆς, καὶ ἀφεῖλε τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ ἀπ’
**9** αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀπεκύλισε τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τῆς στρωμνῆς, καὶ
    ἀφεῖλε τὸ κωνωπεῖον ἀπὸ τῶν στύλων· καὶ μετ’ ὀλίγον ἐξῆλθε,
**10** καὶ παρέδωκε τῇ ἄβρᾳ αὐτῆς τὴν κεφαλὴν Ὁλοφέρνου. Καὶ ἐ-
    νέβαλεν αὐτὴν εἰς τὴν πήραν τῶν βρωμάτων αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐξῆλ-
    θον αἱ δύο ἅμα κατὰ τὸν ἐθισμὸν αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τὴν προσευχὴν· καὶ
    διελθοῦσαι τὴν παρεμβολήν, ἐκύκλωσαν τὴν φάραγγα ἐκείνην,
    καὶ προσανέβησαν τὸ ὄρος Βετυλούα, καὶ ἦλθοσαν πρὸς τὰς πύ-
**11** λας αὐτῆς. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰουδὶθ μακρόθεν τοῖς φυλάσσουσιν ἐπὶ
    τῶν πυλῶν· ἀνοίξατε δὴ, ἀνοίξατε τὴν πύλην, μεθ’ ἡμῶν ὁ
    Θεὸς ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν, ποιῆσαι ἔτι ἰσχὺν ἐν Ἰσραὴλ καὶ κράτος
**12** κατὰ τῶν ἐχθρῶν, καθὰ καὶ σήμερον ἐποίησε. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς
    ἤκουσαν οἱ ἄνδρες τῆς πόλεως αὐτῆς τὴν φωνὴν αὐτῆς, ἐσπού-
    δασαν τοῦ καταβῆναι ἐπὶ τὴν πύλην τῆς πόλεως αὐτῶν, καὶ συ-
**13** νεκάλεσαν τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους τῆς πόλεως. Καὶ συνέδραμον πάν-
    τες ἀπὸ μικροῦ ἕως μεγάλου, ὅτι παράδοξον ἦν αὐτοῖς τὸ ἐλ-
    θεῖν αὐτὴν, καὶ ἤνοιξαν τὴν πύλην, καὶ ὑπεδέξαντο αὐτὰς· καὶ
**14** ἅψαντες πῦρ εἰς φαῦσιν, περιεκύκλωσαν αὐτάς. Ἡ δὲ εἶπε πρὸς
    αὐτοὺς φωνῇ μεγάλῃ· αἰνεῖτε τὸν Κύριον, αἰνεῖτε, αἰνεῖτε τὸν
    Κύριον, ὅτι οὐκ ἀπέστηκε τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τοῦ οἴκου Ἰσραήλ,

#### CHAPTER 13

**2** tent, and Holofernes was fallen upon his bed;
**3** for the wine had overwhelmed him. And Judith said unto her handmaiden to stand outside her chamber, and to watch for her going forth, as [she did] day by day; for she said she would go forth to her prayer; and she spoke unto Bagoas according to these words.
**4** And all departed from her presence, and no man was left in the chamber, from the least unto the greatest. And Judith, standing beside his bed, said in her heart: "O Lord, the God of all power, look down in this hour upon the works of my
**5** hands, for the exalting of Jerusalem; for now is the time to lay hold of Thine inheritance, and to perform my purpose, for the breaking of the enemies who have risen up against us."
**6** And drawing near to the bedpost, which was at Holofernes' head, she took down his scimitar from him.
**7** And drawing near to the bed, she grasped the hair of his head, and said, "Strengthen me, O Lord God of Israel, in this day."
**8** And she struck his neck twice with all her might, and took his head from him.
**9** And she rolled his body from the bed, and took down the canopy from the pillars; and a little while after, she went forth,
**10** and delivered the head of Holofernes to her maidservant. And she put it into her food-bag, and the two went forth together according to their custom to [attend to] prayer; and having passed through the camp, they circled that ravine, and ascended Mount Betyloua, and came unto its gates.
**11** And Judith said from afar to those guarding at the gates, "Open now, open the gate! For with us is God, even our God, to work yet strength in Israel and power against the enemies, as He hath done also this day."
**12** And it came to pass, when the men of her city heard her voice, they hastened to go down to the gate of their city, and called together the elders of the city.
**13** And all ran together, from the least unto the greatest, for it was a marvel unto them that she had come; and they opened the gate, and received them; and
**14** having kindled a fire for light, they surrounded them. And she said unto them with a loud voice, "Praise the Lord! Praise [Him], praise the Lord! For His mercy hath not departed from the house of Israel,
