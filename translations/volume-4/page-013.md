θρώπου υἱός· καὶ ἀκούσας ἔτι Τωβὶτ ἀπώλεσε τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς
8 ἑαυτοῦ, ἐλυπήθη καὶ ἔκλαυσε. Καὶ Ἔδνα ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ καὶ Σά-
ρα ἡ θυγάτηρ αὐτοῦ ἔκλαυσαν, καὶ ὑπεδέξαντο αὐτοὺς προθύ-
9 μως. Καὶ ἔθυσαν κριὸν προβάτων, καὶ παρέθηκαν ἔφα πλείονα·
εἶπε δὲ Τωβίας τῷ Ῥαφαήλ· Ἀζαρία ἀδελφέ, λάλησον ὑπὲρ ὧν
10 ἔλεγες ἐν τῇ πορείᾳ. καὶ τελεσθήτω τὸ πρᾶγμα. Καὶ μετέδω-
κε τὸν λόγον τῷ Ῥαγουήλ. καὶ εἶπε Ῥαγουὴλ πρὸς Τωβίαν·
φάγε καὶ πίε, καὶ ἡδέως γίνου, σοὶ γὰρ καθήκει τὸ παιδίον μου
11 λαβεῖν, πλὴν ὑποδείξω σοι τὴν ἀλήθειαν. Ἔδωκα τὸ παιδίον μου
ἑπτὰ ἀνδράσι, καὶ ὁπότε ἂν εἰσεπορεύοντο πρὸς αὐτήν, ἀπεθνή-
σκον ὑπὸ τὴν νύκτα· ἀλλὰ τὸ νῦν ἔχον, ἡδέως γίνου. καὶ εἶ-
πε Τωβίας· οὐ γεύσομαι οὐδὲν ὧδε, ἕως ἂν στήσητε καὶ στα-
θῆτε πρός με. καὶ εἶπε Ῥαγουήλ· κομίζου αὐτὴν ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν
κατὰ τὴν κρίσιν. σὺ ἀδελφὸς εἶ αὐτῆς, καὶ αὕτη σου ἐστίν. ὁ
12 δὲ ἐλεήμων Θεὸς εὐοδώσει ὑμῖν τὰ κάλλιστα. Καὶ ἐκάλεσε Σά-
ρὰν τὴν θυγατέρα αὐτοῦ, καὶ λαβὼν τῆς χειρὸς αὐτῆς, παρέ-
δωκεν αὐτὴν τῷ Τωβίᾳ γυναῖκα, καὶ εἶπεν· ἰδοὺ κατὰ τὸν νόμον
Μωϋσέως κομίζου αὐτήν, καὶ ἄπαγε πρὸς τὸν πατέρα σου. καὶ
13 ηὐλόγησεν αὐτούς. Καὶ ἐκάλεσεν Ἔδναν τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ, καὶ
14 λαβὼν βιβλίον, ἔγραψε συγγραφήν, καὶ ἐσφραγίσατο. Καὶ ἤρ-
15 ξαντο ἐσθίειν. Καὶ ἐκάλεσε Ῥαγουὴλ Ἔδναν τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ,
καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ· ἀδελφή, ἑτοίμασον τὸ ἕτερον ταμεῖον, καὶ εἰ-
16 σάγαγε αὐτήν. Καὶ ἐποίησεν ὡς εἶπε· καὶ εἰσήγαγεν αὐτὴν ἐκεῖ,
καὶ ἔκλαυσεν. καὶ ἀπεδέξατο τὰ δάκρυα τῆς θυγατρὸς αὐτῆς,
17 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ· Θάρσει τέκνον, ὁ Κύριος τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ τῆς
γῆς δώῃ σοι χάριν ἀντὶ τῆς λύπης σου ταύτης· θάρσει, θύγατερ.

### CHAPTER 8

1 ὌΤΕ δὲ συνετελέσαν δειπνοῦντες, εἰσήγαγον Τωβίαν πρὸς αὐ-
2 τήν. Ὁ δὲ πορευόμενος ἐμνήσθη τῶν λόγων Ῥαφαήλ, καὶ ἔλαβε
3 τὴν τέφραν τῶν θυμιαμάτων, καὶ ἐπέθηκε τὴν καρδίαν τοῦ ἰχθύος
καὶ τὸ ἧπαρ, καὶ ἐκάπνισεν. Ὅτε δὲ ὠσφράνθη τὸ δαιμόνιον τῆς
ὀσμῆς, ἔφυγεν ἕως εἰς τὰ ἀνώτατα Αἰγύπτου, καὶ ἔδησεν αὐτὸ
4 ὁ ἄγγελος. Ὡς δὲ συνεκλείσθησαν ἀμφότεροι, ἀνέστη Τωβίας
ἀπὸ τῆς κλίνης, καὶ εἶπεν· ἀνάστηθι, ἀδελφή, καὶ προσευξώμεθα.

[Tobit 7:7 (continued)]
...son of a good and virtuous man. And when he heard yet more that Tobit had lost his eyes, he was grieved and wept.

[Tobit 7:8]
And Edna his wife and Sarah his daughter likewise wept, and they received them with willingness [and hospitality].

[Tobit 7:9]
And they slew a ram from the flock, and set much food before them. Then spake Tobias unto Raphael, saying, "Azariah, my brother, speak of those things which thou didst tell me on the journey. And let the matter be accomplished."

[Tobit 7:10]
Then [Raphael] conveyed the message unto Raguel. And Raguel said unto Tobias, "Eat and drink, and be merry; for it is meet that thou shouldst take my daughter.

[Tobit 7:11]
Nevertheless, I will show thee the truth: I have given my daughter unto seven men, and whensoever they did go in unto her, they died during the night. But for the present, be merry." And Tobias said, "I will taste of nothing here until ye make firm and stand by your word unto me." And Raguel said, "Take her from this time forth according to the ordinance [of the Law]. Thou art her brother, and she is thine.

[Tobit 7:12]
And may the merciful God prosper you in the best of ways." Then he called Sarah his daughter, and taking her by the hand, he gave her unto Tobias to be his wife, and said, "Behold, according to the Law of Moses, take her; and go forth unto thy father." And he blessed them.

[Tobit 7:13]
Then he called Edna his wife,

[Tobit 7:14]
and taking a scroll, he wrote a marriage contract, and sealed it.

[Tobit 7:15]
And they began to eat. Then Raguel called Edna his wife, and said unto her, "Sister, prepare the other chamber, and lead her in thither."

[Tobit 7:16]
And she did as he commanded; and she brought her in thither, and she wept. And she received the tears of her daughter,

[Tobit 7:17]
and said unto her, "Be of good cheer, my child! May the Lord of heaven and earth grant thee grace instead of this thy sorrow. Be of good cheer, my daughter."

### CHAPTER 8

[Tobit 8:1]
Now when they had finished dining, they brought Tobias in unto her.

[Tobit 8:2]
And as he went, he remembered the words of Raphael, and he took

[Tobit 8:3]
the ashes of incense, and laid upon them the heart of the fish and the liver, and made a smoke thereof. And when the demon smelled the savor, it fled unto the uppermost parts of Egypt, and the angel bound it.

[Tobit 8:4]
And when they were both shut in, Tobias rose from the bed, and said, "Rise up, my sister, and let us pray."
