**50** παρεμβολὴ τοῦ παρεμβαλεῖν ἕκαστον ἐν ᾧ ἐστι τόπῳ. Καὶ παρενέβαλον οἱ ἄνδρες τῆς δυνάμεως, καὶ ἐπολέμησαν τὴν πόλιν ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν ἐκείνην καὶ ὅλην τὴν νύκτα, καὶ παρεδόθη ἡ πόλις ἐν χερσὶν αὐτοῦ.
**51** Καὶ ἀπώλεσε πᾶν ἀρσενικὸν ἐν στόματι ῥομφαίας, καὶ ἐξερίζωσεν αὐτὴν, καὶ ἔλαβε τὰ σκῦλα τῆς πόλεως, καὶ δίῆλθε διὰ τῆς πόλεως ἐπάνω τῶν ἀπεκταμμένων.
**52** Καὶ διέβησαν τὸν Ἰορδάνην εἰς τὸ πεδίον τὸ μέγα κατὰ πρόσωπον Βαιθσάν.
**53** Καὶ ἦν Ἰούδας ἐπισυνάγων τοὺς ἐσχατίζοντας, καὶ παρακαλῶν τὸν λαὸν κατὰ πᾶσαν τὴν ὁδὸν, ἕως οὗ ἦλθεν εἰς γῆν Ἰούδα.
**54** Καὶ ἀνέβησαν εἰς τὸ ὄρος Σιὼν ἐν εὐφροσύνῃ καὶ χαρᾷ· καὶ προσήγαγον ὁλοκαυτώματα, ὅτι οὐκ ἔπεσεν ἐξ αὐτῶν οὐδεὶς ἕως τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι ἐν εἰρήνῃ.
**55** Καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις αἷς ἦν Ἰούδας καὶ Ἰωνάθαν ἐν τῇ Γαλαάδ, καὶ Σίμων ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ Γαλιλαίᾳ κατὰ πρόσωπον Πτολεμαῖδος,
**56** ἤκουσεν Ἰώσηφ ὁ τοῦ Ζαχαρίου καὶ Ἀζαρίας ἄρχοντες τῶν δυνάμεων τῶν ἀνδραγαθιῶν καὶ τοῦ πολέμου οἷα ἐποίησαν,
**57** καὶ εἶπαν· ποιήσωμεν καὶ αὐτοὶ ἑαυτοῖς ὄνομα, καὶ πορευθῶμεν πολεμῆσαι πρὸς τὰ ἔθνη τὰ κύκλῳ ἡμῶν.
**58** Καὶ παρήγγειλαν τοῖς ἀπὸ τῆς δυνάμεως τῆς μετ᾽ αὐτῶν,
**59** καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν ἐπὶ Ἰάμναν. Καὶ ἐξῆλθε Γοργίας ἐκ τῆς πόλεως, καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες αὐτοῦ εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτοῖς εἰς πόλεμον.
**60** Καὶ ἐτροπώθη Ἰώσηφος καὶ Ἀζαρίας, καὶ ἐδιώχθησαν ἕως τῶν ὁρίων τῆς Ἰουδαίας·
**61** καὶ ἔπεσον ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ εἰς δισχιλίους ἄνδρας, καὶ ἐγενήθη τροπὴ μεγάλη ἐν τῷ λαῷ Ἰσραὴλ, ὅτι οὐκ ἤκουσαν Ἰούδου καὶ τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτοῦ, οἰόμενοι ἀνδραγαθῆσαι.
**62** Αὐτοὶ δὲ οὐκ ἦσαν ἐκ τοῦ σπέρματος τῶν ἀνδρῶν ἐκείνων, οἷς ἐδόθη σωτηρία Ἰσραὴλ διὰ χειρὸς αὐτῶν.
**63** Καὶ ὁ ἀνὴρ Ἰούδας καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ ἐδοξάσθησαν σφόδρα ἐναντίον παντὸς Ἰσραὴλ καὶ τῶν ἐθνῶν πάντων, οὗ ἠκούετο τὸ ὄνομα αὐτῶν.
**64** Καὶ ἐπισυνήγοντο πρὸς αὐτοὺς εὐφημοῦντες.
**65** Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Ἰούδας καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπολέμουν τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἠσαῦ ἐν τῇ γῇ τῇ πρὸς νότον, καὶ ἐπάταξε τὴν Χεβρὼν καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας αὐτῆς·
**66** καὶ καθεῖλε τὸ ὀχύρωμα αὐτῆς, καὶ τοὺς πύργους αὐτῆς ἐνεπύρισε κυκλόθεν. Καὶ ἀπῆρε τοῦ πορευθῆναι εἰς γῆν ἀλλοφύλων, καὶ διεπορεύετο τὴν Σαμαρείαν.
**67** Ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἔπεσαν ἱερεῖς ἐν πολέμῳ βουλόμενοι ἀνδραγαθῆσαι, ἐν τῷ αὐτοὺς ἐξελθεῖν εἰς τὸν πόλεμον ἀβουλευτῶς.
