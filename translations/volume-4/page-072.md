50 δίαν ἡμῖν τε καὶ τοῖς συνοῦσιν ἡμῖν, τέκνοις ἡμῶν, καὶ κτήνεσιν.
51 Ἐνετράπην γὰρ αἰτῆσαι τὸν βασιλέα πεζοὺς τε καὶ ἱππεῖς καὶ προπομπὴν ἕνεκεν ἀσφαλείας τῆς πρὸς τοὺς ἐναντιουμένους ἡμῖν.
52 Εἴπαμεν γὰρ τῷ βασιλεῖ, ὅτι ἰσχὺς τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν ἔσται μετὰ τῶν ἐπιζητούντων αὐτὸν εἰς πᾶσαν ἐπανόρθωσιν.
53 Καὶ πάλιν ἐδεήθημεν τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν κατὰ ταῦτα, καὶ εὐιλάτου ἐτύχομεν.
54 Καὶ ἐχώρισα τῶν φυλάρχων τῶν ἱερέων ἄνδρας δώδεκα, καὶ Ἐσερεδίαν καὶ Ἀσαμίαν, καὶ μετ᾿ αὐτῶν ἐκ τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτῶν ἄνδρας δέκα.
55 Καὶ ἔστησα αὐτοῖς τὸ ἀργύριον, καὶ τὸ χρυσίον, καὶ τὰ ἱερὰ σκεύη τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν, ἃ ἐδωρήσατο ὁ βασιλεύς, καὶ οἱ σύμβουλοι αὐτοῦ, καὶ οἱ μεγιστάνες, καὶ πᾶς Ἰσραήλ.
56 Καὶ στήσας παρέδωκα αὐτοῖς ἀργυρίου τάλαντα ἑξακόσια καὶ πεντήκοντα, καὶ σκεύη ἀργύρα ταλάντων ἑκατόν, καὶ χρυσίου τάλαντα ἑκατόν, καὶ χρυσώματα εἴκοσι, καὶ σκεύη χάλκεα ἀπὸ χρηστοῦ χαλκοῦ στίλβοντα, χρυσοειδῆ σκεύη δώδεκα.
57 Καὶ εἶπα αὐτοῖς· καὶ ὑμεῖς ἅγιοι ἔστὲ τῷ Κυρίῳ (Κύριος) καὶ τὰ σκεύη ἅγια, καὶ τὸ χρυσίον καὶ τὸ ἀργύριον εὐχὴ τῷ Κυρίῳ, Κυρίῳ τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν.
58 Ἀγρυπνεῖτε, καὶ φυλάσσετε ἕως τοῦ παραδοῦναι αὐτὰ ὑμᾶς τοῖς φυλάρχοις τῶν ἱερέων καὶ τῶν Λευιτῶν, καὶ τοῖς ἡγουμένοις τῶν πατριῶν τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, ἐν τοῖς παστοφορίοις τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν.
59 Καὶ οἱ παραλαβόντες οἱ ἱερεῖς καὶ οἱ Λευῖται τὸ ἀργύριον, καὶ τὸ χρυσίον, καὶ τὰ σκεύη τὰ ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, εἰσήνεγκαν εἰς τὸ ἱερὸν τοῦ Κυρίου.
60 Καὶ ἀναζεύξαντες ἀπὸ τοῦ ποταμοῦ Θερὰ τῇ δωδεκάτῃ τοῦ πρώτου μηνὸς ἕως εἰσήλθομεν εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ κατὰ τὴν κραταιὰν χεῖρα τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν τὴν ἐφ᾿ ἡμῖν. καὶ ἐῤῥύσατο ἡμᾶς ἀπὸ τῆς εἰσόδου Κύριος ἀπὸ παντὸς ἐχθροῦ, καὶ ἤλθομεν εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ.
61 Καὶ γενομένης αὐτόθι ἡμέρας τρίτης, τῇ (δὲ) ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τετάρτῃ σταθὲν τὸ ἀργύριον καὶ τὸ χρυσίον παρεδόθη ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν Μαρμαθὶ Οὐρὶ ἱερεῖ·
62 καὶ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ Ἐλεάζαρ δ τοῦ Φινεές, καὶ ἦσαν μετ᾿ αὐτῶν Ἰωσαβδὸς Ἰησοῦ, καὶ Μωὲδ Σαβάννου, οἱ Λευῖται· πρὸς ἀριθμὸν καὶ ἑλκὴν ἅπαντα. Καὶ ἐγράφη πᾶσα ἡ ἑλκὴ αὐτῶν αὐτῇ τῇ ὥρᾳ.
63 Οἱ δὲ παραγενόμενοι ἐκ τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας προσήνεγκαν θυσίας τῷ Θεῷ τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ Κυρίῳ, ταύρους δώδεκα ὑπὲρ παντὸς Ἰσραήλ, χριοὺς ἐνενηκονταέξ, ἄρνας ἑβδομηκονταδύο, τράγους ὑπὲρ σωτηρίου δώδεκα, ἅπαντα θυσίαν τῷ Κυρίῳ.
64 Καὶ ἀπέδωκαν τὰ προστάγματα τοῦ βασιλέως τοῖς βασιλικοῖς οἰκονόμοις, καὶ τοῖς ἐπάρχοις κοίλης Συρίας καὶ Φοινίκης, καὶ ἐδόξασαν τὸ ἔθνος καὶ τὸ ἱερὸν τοῦ Κυρίου.

**Chapter 8**
**50** ...perity for us, and for those who were with us, [even] our children, and our livestock.
**51** For I was ashamed to ask of the king an escort of footmen and of horsemen, for the sake of safety against our adversaries.
**52** For we had spoken unto the king, saying, that the strength of our Lord shall be with all them that seek Him for all [manner of] good.
**53** And again we besought our Lord concerning these things, and we obtained His gracious favor.
**54** And I separated twelve men of the chief priests, even Eserebias and Asamias; and with them, of their brethren, ten men.
**55** And I weighed out unto them the silver, and the gold, and the sacred vessels for the House of our Lord, which the king had given, and his counselors, and his nobles, and all Israel.
**56** And having weighed them, I delivered unto them six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels [weighing] an hundred talents, and an hundred talents of gold, and twenty golden bowls, and twelve vessels of shining, fine bronze, [which were] like unto gold.
**57** And I said unto them, Ye also are holy unto the Lord, [ye are] holy [unto the Lord], and the vessels are holy, and the gold and the silver are a vow unto the Lord, the Lord of our fathers.
**58** Watch ye, and keep them, until ye deliver them unto the chief men of the priests and of the Levites, and unto the heads of the families of Israel in Jerusalem, in the chambers of the House of our Lord.
**59** And the priests and the Levites, who had received the silver, and the gold, and the vessels [once they were come] into Jerusalem, brought them into the temple of the Lord.
**60** And we departed from the river Thera on the twelfth day of the first month, until we entered into Jerusalem, according to the mighty hand of our Lord which was upon us. And the Lord delivered us from the assault of every enemy, and we came unto Jerusalem.
**61** And when three days were passed there, on the fourth day the silver and the gold, being weighed, were delivered in the House of our Lord unto Marmathi Uri the priest;
**62** and with him Eleazar D. of Phinehas; and there were with them Josabdos [son] of Jesus, and Moed [son] of Sabannou, the Levites; all [was delivered] by number and by weight. And all their weight was recorded in that very hour.
**63** And they who were come out of the captivity offered sacrifices unto the Lord, the God of Israel: twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and two lambs, and twelve he-goats for a sacrifice of well-being; all these were a sacrifice unto the Lord.
**64** And they delivered the king's decrees unto the king's stewards, and unto the governors of Coele-Syria and Phoenicia; and they brought honor unto the nation and unto the temple of the Lord.
