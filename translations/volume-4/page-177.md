ἰκανὴν ἐποίησαν ἐν τῷ τόπῳ τραχύτητα, μόλις δὲ ὑπό τε τῶν
γεραιῶν καὶ τῶν πρεσβυτέρων ἀποτραπέντες, ἐπὶ τὴν αὐτὴν τῆς
24 δεήσεως ἔστησαν στάσιν. Καὶ τὸ μὲν πλῆθος ὡς ἔμπροσθεν ἐν
25 τούτοις ἀνεστρέφετο δεόμενον. Οἱ δὲ περὶ τὸν βασιλέα πρεσβύ-
    τεροι, πολλαχῶς ἐπειρῶντο τὸν ἀγέρωχον αὐτοῦ νοῦν ἐξιστᾶ-
26 νειν τῆς ἐντεθυμημένης βουλῆς. Θρασυνθεὶς δὲ καὶ πάντας πα-
    ραπέμψας, ἤδη καὶ πρόσβασιν ἐποιεῖτο, τέλος ἐπιθήσειν δοκῶν
27 τῷ προειρημένῳ. Ταῦτ᾽ οὖν καὶ οἱ περὶ αὐτὸν ὄντες θεωροῦν-
    τες ἐτράπησαν εἰς τὸ σὺν τοῖς ἡμετέροις ἐπικαλεῖσθαι τὸν πᾶν
    κράτος ἔχοντα, τοῖς παροῦσιν ἐπαμῦναι, μὴ παριδόντα τὴν ἄνο-
28 μον καὶ ὑπερήφανον πρᾶξιν. Ἐκ δὲ τῆς πυκνοτάτης τε καὶ ἐμ-
    πίνου τῶν ὄχλων συναγομένης κραυγῆς, ἀνείκαστός τις ἦν βοή.
29 Δοκεῖν γὰρ ἦν μὴ μόνον τοὺς ἀνθρώπους, ἀλλὰ καὶ τὰ τείχη
    καὶ τὸ πᾶν ἔδαφος ἠχεῖν, ἅτε δὴ τῶν πάντων τότε θάνατον
    ἀλλαστομένων ἀντὶ τῆς τοῦ τόπου βεβηλώσεως.

1 Ὁ μὲν οὖν ἀρχιερεὺς Σίμων ἐξεναντίας τοῦ ναοῦ κάμψας τὰ
    γόνατα, καὶ τὰς χεῖρας προτείνας εὐτάκτως, ἐποιήσατο τὴν δέη-
2 σιν τοιαύτην. Κύριε, Κύριε, βασιλεῦ τῶν οὐρανῶν, καὶ δέσπο-
    τα πάσης τῆς κτίσεως, ἅγιε ἐν ἁγίοις, μόναρχε, παντοκράτωρ,
    πρόσχες ἡμῖν καταπονουμένοις ὑπὸ ἀνοσίου καὶ βεβήλου, θράσει
3 καὶ σθένει πεφρυγμένου. Σὺ γὰρ εἶ ὁ κτίσας τὰ πάντα, καὶ
    τῶν ὅλων ἐπικρατῶν δυνάστης δίκαιος εἶ, καὶ τοὺς ὕβρει καὶ ἀ-
4 γερωχία τι πράσσοντος κρίνεις. Σὺ τοὺς ἔμπροσθεν ἀδικίαν ποιή-
    σαντας, ἐν οἷς καὶ γίγαντες ἦσαν ξώμῃ καὶ θράσει πεποιθότες,
5 διέφθειρας, ἐπαγαγὼν αὐτοῖς ἀμέτρητον ὕδωρ. Σὺ τοὺς ὑπερη-
    φανίαν ἐργαζομένους Σοδομίτας διαδήλους ταῖς κακίαις γενομέ-
    νους, πυρὶ καὶ θείῳ κατέφλεξας, παράδειγμα τοῖς ἐπιγινομένοις
6 καταστήσας. Σὺ τὸν θρασὺν Φαραὼ καταδουλωσάμενον τὸ λαόν
    σου τὸν ἅγιον Ἰσραήλ, ποικίλαις καὶ πολλαῖς δοκιμάσας τιμω-
    ρίαις, ἐγνώρισας τὴν σὴν δυναστείαν· ἐφ᾽ αἷς ἐγνώρισας τὸ μέ-
7 γα σου κράτος. Καὶ ἐπιδιώξαντα αὐτὸν σὺν ἅρμασι καὶ ὄχλων
    πλήθει, ἐπέκλεισας βάθει θαλάσσης, τοὺς δὲ ἐμπιστεύσαντας ἐπὶ
8 σοὶ τῷ τῆς ἁπάσης κτίσεως δυναστεύοντι, σώους διεκώμισας. Οἱ

**Chapter 1**

**24** And the multitude, as before, did busy themselves in these things, making supplication.

**25** But the elders about the king did in many ways endeavour to divert his arrogant mind from his conceived purpose.

**26** But he, becoming yet more emboldened, and having dismissed all [of them], did now make his approach, thinking to put an end to that which was before determined.

**27** Therefore, even those who were with him, seeing these things, turned to call upon Him who hath all might, together with our people, to aid those present, not overlooking the lawless and arrogant deed.

**28** And from the very dense and piercing cry that was gathered from the throngs, there was an inexpressible roar.

**29** For it seemed that not only the men, but also the walls and all the ground did resound, as indeed all were at that time preferring death before the defilement of the place.

**Chapter 2**

**1** The High Priest Simon, therefore, bending his knees opposite the Temple, and stretching forth his hands in seemly wise, did make his supplication after this manner:

**2** "O Lord, O Lord, Thou King of the heavens, and Master of all creation, Holy of Holies, Sole Ruler, Almighty God, give ear unto us who are sore distressed by one unholy and profane, who is puffed up with audacity and with might.

**3** For Thou art He that created all things, and Thou art a righteous Sovereign, who dost hold sway over all, and Thou judgest them that act with insolence and with arrogance.

**4** Thou didst destroy them that aforetime wrought unrighteousness, among whom were also giants, trusting in their [physical] strength and their audacity, bringing upon them an immeasurable flood [of water].

**5** Thou didst consume with fire and brimstone the Sodomites, who wrought arrogance and were made manifest in their wickedness, setting them as an ensample to them that should come after.

**6** Thou, having enslaved Thy holy people Israel, didst test the audacious Pharaoh with diverse and with many punishments, making known Thy sovereignty; by which [deeds] Thou didst make known Thy great might.

**7** And when he pursued them with chariots and with a multitude of throngs, Thou didst shut him up in the depths of the sea; but them that trusted in Thee, who rulest over all creation, Thou didst bring through safely.

**8** Who also, having seen the works of Thy hand, did praise Thee, the Almighty.
