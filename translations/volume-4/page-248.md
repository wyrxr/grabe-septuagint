**ΚΕΦ. ΙΔʹ. XIV.**

**18.** νάμενον, περὶ δὲ πορισμοῦ καὶ ἐργασίας καὶ χειρῶν ἐπιτυχίας
**19.** τὸ ἀδρανέστατον ταῖς χερσὶν εὐδράνειαν αἰτεῖται.

**ΚΕΦ. ΙΔʹ. XIV.**

**1.** Πλοῦν τις πάλιν ἐσσελόμενος, καὶ ἄγρια μέλλων διοδεύειν
    κύματα, τοῦ φέροντος αὐτὸν ξύλου σαθρότερον ξύλον ἐπιβᾶται.
**2.** Ἐκεῖνο μὲρ γὰρ ὄρεξις πορισμῶν ἐπενόησε, τεχνίτις δὲ σοφία κα-

**3.** ἡ δὲ σὴ πάτερ διακυβερνᾶ πρόνοια· ὅτι ἔδωκας καὶ ἐν
    θαλάσσῃ ὁδόν, καὶ ἐν κύμασι τριβὸν ἀσφαλῆ·
**4.** δεικνὺς ὅτι δύνασαι
    ἐκ πάντων σώζειν, ἵνα καὶ ἄνευ τέχνης τις ἐπιβῇ.
**5.** Θέλεῖς δὲ
    μὴ ἀργὰ εἶναι τὰ τῆς σοφίας σου ἔργα· διὰ τοῦτο καὶ ἐλαχίστῳ
    ξύλῳ πιστεύουσιν ἄνθρωποι ψυχάς, καὶ διελθόντες κλύδωνα σχε-
    δίᾳ διεσώθησαν.
**6.** Καὶ ἀρχῆς γὰρ ἀπολλυμένων ὑπερηφάνων γι-
    γάντων ἡ ἐλπὶς τοῦ κόσμου ἐπὶ σχεδίας καταφυγοῦσα, ἀπέλιπεν
    αἰῶνι σπέρμα γενέσεως, τῇ σῇ κυβερνηθεῖσα χειρί.
**7.** Εὐλόγηται
    γὰρ ξύλον δι᾿ οὗ γίνεται δικαιοσύνη·
**8.** τὸ χειροποίητον δὲ ἐπικα-
    τάρατον αὐτό, καὶ ὁ ποιήσας αὐτό· ὅτι ὁ μὲν εἰργάζετο, τὸ δὲ
    φθαρτὸν ὂν θεὸς ὠνομάσθη.
**9.** Ἐν ἴσῳ γὰρ μισητὰ Θεῷ καὶ ὁ ἀ-
    σεβῶν καὶ ἡ ἀσέβεια αὐτοῦ·

**11.** Διὰ τοῦτο καὶ ἐν εἰδώλοις ἐθνῶν ἐπισκοπὴ
    ἔσται, ὅτι ἐν κτίσματι Θεοῦ εἰς βδέλυγμα ἐγενήθησαν, καὶ εἰς σκάν-
    δαλα ψυχαῖς ἀνθρώπων, καὶ εἰς παγίδα ποσὶν ἀφρόνων.
**12.** Ἀρχὴ
    γὰρ πορνείας ἐπίνοια εἰδώλων· εὕρεσις δὲ αὐτῶν φθορὰ ζωῆς.

**CHAPTER XIII.**

**18** ...that which is unable even to use its feet;
**19** and concerning provision, and concerning work,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the success of [his] hands,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he entreateth that which is most impotent of hands for dexterity.

**CHAPTER XIV.**

**1** Again, one sailing [upon the waters],
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and being about to journey through wild waves,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doth trust a piece of wood more frail
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than the very wood which beareth him.
**2** For that [vessel] was devised by the yearning for gain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and fashioned by the wisdom of the craftsman;
**3** but thy providence, O Father, doth steer [it];
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for Thou hast made a path in the sea,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and in the waves a sure way;
**4** showing that Thou art able to save from all things,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that even if one embark without skill.
**5** Yet Thou desirest that the works of Thy wisdom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should not be made idle;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for this cause do men entrust their very lives
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto a most meager piece of wood,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and having passed through the surge by raft, were they delivered.
**6** For even from the beginning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when the proud giants perished,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the hope of the world, having taken refuge upon a raft,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;did leave unto the age a seed of generation,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;being guided by Thy hand.
**7** For blessed is the wood, by the which righteousness is wrought;
**8** but the work of men's hands is accursed,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;both it and he who made it;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the one did labor, and the other,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;being corruptible, was called god.
**9** For equally hateful unto God are both the ungodly one
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his ungodliness;
**10** and indeed, that which was wrought
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be punished together with him that wrought it.
**11** Therefore, even among the idols of the nations shall there be a visitation,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because in the creation of God they were made an abomination,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and [became] stumblingblocks unto the souls of men,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a snare unto the feet of the foolish.
**12** For the devising of idols is the beginning of spiritual unchastity,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the finding of them the corruption of life.
**13** For neither was it from the beginning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor shall it be unto the age;
**14** for the vainglory of men (death) entered into the world,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and for this cause was their end devised to be swift.
**15** For a father, consumed by untimely grief,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;having made an image of his child swiftly taken away,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;did now honor as God him who was then but a dead man;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and delivered unto those under his hand [to observe] mysteries and rites.
**16** Then in time, this ungodly custom, having become established,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was kept as law;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and by the commands of tyrants
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were the graven images worshipped.
**17** Whom men were unable to honor in [their] presence,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by reason of their dwelling far off,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they, having reproduced his distant form,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;did make a manifest image of the honored king;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that they might flatter the absent one as though he were present,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through their zeal.
**18** Moreover, for the furtherance of worship,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ambition of the craftsman did urge forward even those who were ignorant,
