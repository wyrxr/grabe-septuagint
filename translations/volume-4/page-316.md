ΚΕΦ. ΜΖ΄. ΙΗΣΟΥ ΥΙΟΥ ΣΙΡΑΧ
1847
τῶν γλυκαίνειν μέλη, καὶ καθ᾽ ἡμέραν αἰνέσουσιν ἐν ταῖς ᾠδαῖς
αὐτῶν· ἔδωκεν ἐν ἑορταῖς εὐπρέπειαν, καὶ ἐκόσμησε καιροὺς μέ- 10
χρι συντελείας, ἐν τῷ αἰνεῖν αὐτοῦ τὸ ἅγιον ὄνομα αὐτοῦ, καὶ
ἀπὸ πρωΐας ἠχεῖν τὸ ἁγίασμα. Κύριος ἀφεῖλε τὰς ἁμαρτίας 11
αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀνύψωσεν εἰς αἰῶνα τὸ κέρας αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐ-
τῷ διαθήκην βασιλέων καὶ θρόνον δόξης ἐν τῷ Ἰσραήλ. Μετὰ 12
τοῦτον ἀνέστη υἱὸς ἐπιστήμων, καὶ δι᾽ αὐτὸν κατέλυσεν ἐν πλα-
τυσμῷ· Σολομὼν ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν ἡμέραις εἰρήνης, ᾧ ὁ Θεὸς κα- 13
τέπαυσε κυκλόθεν, ἵνα στήσῃ οἶκον ἐπ᾽ ὀνόματι αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἑτοι-
μάσῃ ἁγίασμα εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα. Ὦ ἐσοφίσθης ἐν νεότητί σου, καὶ 14
ἐνεπλήσθης ὡς ποταμὸς συνέσεως· Γῆν ἐπεκάλυψεν ἡ ψυχή σου, 15
καὶ ἐνέπλησας ἐν παραβολαῖς αἰνιγμάτων· εἰς νήσους πόῤῥω ἀφί- 16
κετο τὸ ὄνομά σου, καὶ ἠγαπήθης ἐν τῇ εἰρήνῃ σου. Καὶ ἐν ᾠδαῖς 17
καὶ παροιμίαις καὶ παραβολαῖς, καὶ ἐν ἑρμηνείαις ἀπεθαυμάσθησε χῶραι.
Ἐν ὀνόματι Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ ἐπικεκλημένου Θεοῦ 18
Ἰσραήλ, συνήγαγες ὡς κασσίτερον τὸ χρυσίον, καὶ ὡς μόλυβδον
ἐπλήθυνας ἀργύριον. Παρανέκλινας τὰς λαγόνας σου γυναιξί, καὶ 19
ἐνεζουσιάσθης ἐν τῷ σώματί σου· ἔδωκας μῶμον ἐν τῇ δόξῃ σου· 20
καὶ ἐβεβήλωσας τὸ σπέρμα σου, ἐπαγαγεῖν ὀργὴν ἐπὶ τὰ
τέκνα σου, καὶ κατανογῆναι ἐπὶ τῇ ἀφροσύνῃ σου· γενέσθαι 21
δίχα τυραννίδα, καὶ ἐξ Ἐφραὶμ ἄρξαι βασιλείαν ἀπειθῆ. Ὁ 22
δὲ Κύριος οὐ μὴ ἐγκαταλείπῃ τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐ μὴ
διαφθείρῃ ἀπὸ τῶν ἔργων αὐτοῦ, οὐδὲ μὴ ἐξαλείψῃ ἐκλεκτοῦ
αὐτοῦ ἔκγονα, καὶ τὸ σπέρμα τοῦ ἀγαπήσαντος αὐτὸν οὐ μὴ
ἐξάρῃ· καὶ τῷ Ἰακὼβ ἔδωκε κατάλειμμα, καὶ τῷ Δαυὶδ ἐξ αὐ-
τοῦ ῥίζαν. Καὶ ἀνεπαύσατο Σαλωμὼν μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ, 23
καὶ κατέλιπε μεθ᾽ αὑτὸν ἐκ τοῦ σπέματος αὐτοῦ λαοῦ ἀφροσύνην
καὶ ἐλασσούμενον συνέσει Ῥοβοάμ, ὃς ἀπέστησε τὸν λαὸν ἐκ βου-
λῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ Ἱεροβοάμ υἱὸν Ναβάτ, ὃς ἐξήμαρτε τὸν Ἰσ-
ραήλ, καὶ ἔδωκε τῷ Ἐφραὶμ ὁδὸν ἁμαρτίας· καὶ ἐπληθύνθησαν 24
αἱ ἁμαρτίαι αὐτῶν σφόδρα, ἀποστῆσαι αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς αὐ-
τῶν καὶ πᾶσαν πονηρίαν ἐξεζήτησαν, ἕως ἐκδίκησις ἔλθῃ ἐπ᾽ αὐτοῦς. 25

**Chapter Forty-Seven**

9 ...to sweeten their melodies,
And daily they shall praise in their songs.
He gave to the feasts comeliness,
And adorned the seasons until the consummation,
10 In praising His holy Name,
And from the morning to make the sanctuary resound.
11 The Lord took away his sins,
And exalted his horn forever,
And gave unto him a covenant of kings,
And a throne of glory in Israel.
12 After him arose a son of understanding,
And through him [God] caused [him] to dwell in spaciousness:
Solomon reigned in days of peace,
13 Whom God caused to rest from all round about,
That he might set up a house in His Name,
And prepare a sanctuary for the ages.
14 O, how wise wast thou in thy youth,
And wast filled as a river with understanding!
15 Thy soul covered the earth,
And thou didst fill [it] with parables of riddles.
16 Unto islands far distant did thy name arrive,
And thou wast beloved in thy peace.
17 And in songs, and proverbs, and parables,
And in interpretations, were the lands wondered at.
18 In the Name of the Lord God,
The invoked God of Israel,
Thou didst gather gold as tin,
And as lead didst thou multiply silver.
19 Thou didst incline thy loins unto women,
And wast made licentious in thy body.
Thou didst give a blemish unto thy glory,
20 And didst defile thy seed,
To bring wrath upon thy children,
And to be cut off because of thy foolishness:
21 To become a divided tyranny,
And from Ephraim to rule a disobedient kingdom.
22 But the Lord shall never forsake His mercy,
And shall never destroy [aught] of His works.
Nor shall He ever blot out the offspring of His chosen one,
And the seed of him who loved Him shall He never remove;
And unto Jacob He gave a remnant,
And to David, from Him, a root.
23 And Solomon rested with his fathers,
And left behind him, from his seed,
The foolishness of a people,
Even Rehoboam, lacking in understanding,
Who turned away the people from his counsel.
And Jeroboam, the son of Nebat,
24 Who caused Israel to sin,
And gave unto Ephraim a way of transgression.
And their sins were multiplied exceedingly,
25 To remove them from their land;
And they sought after all wickedness,
Until vengeance came upon them.
