γὰρ χεῖρες καὶ πόδες συμφώνως τοῖς τῆς ψυχῆς ἀρχηγήμασι κι-
νοῦνται· οὕτως οἱ ἱεροὶ μείρακες ἐκεῖνοι ὡς ὑπὸ ψυχῆς μιᾶς τῆς
ἀθανάτου τῆς εὐσεβείας κινούμενοι, πρὸς τὸν ὑπὲρ αὐτῆς συνε-
φώνησαν θάνατον. Ὢ παναγίας συμφώνων ἀδελφῶν ἑβδομάδος,
καθάπερ γὰρ ἑπτὰ τῆς κοσμοποιΐας ἡμέραι περὶ τὴν εὐσέβειαν·
οὕτως περὶ τὴν ἑβδομάδα χορεύοντες οἱ μείρακες ἐκύκλουν τὸν
9 τὸν βύσανον φόβον καταλύοντες. Νῦν ἡμεῖς ἀκούοντες τὴν θλί-
ψιν τῶν νεανίων ἐκείνων, φρίττομεν· οἱ δὲ οὐ μόνον δρῶντες,
ἀλλ᾿ οὐδὲ μόνον ἀκούοντες τὸν παραχρῆμα ἀπειλῆς λόγον, ἀλλὰ
καὶ πάσχοντες, ἐκαρτέρουν καὶ τοῦτο ταῖς διὰ πυρὸς ὀδύναις.
10 Ὥν τί ἂν γένοιτο ἐπαλγέστερον; ὀξεῖα γὰρ καὶ σύντομος ἡ τοῦ
11 πυρὸς οὖσα δύναμις, ταχέως διέλυσε τὰ σώματα. Καὶ μὴ θαυ-
μαστὸν ἡγεῖσθε, εἰ ὁ λογισμὸς περικράτησεν τῶν ἀνδρῶν ἐκεί-
νων ἐν ταῖς βασάνοις, ὅπου γε καὶ γυναικὸς νοῦς πολυτροπωτέρων
12 ὑπερεφρόνησεν ἀλγηδόνων. Ἡ μήτηρ γὰρ τῶν ἑπτὰ νεανίσκων
ἐκείνων ὑπήνεγκεν τὰς ἐφ᾿ ἑνὶ ἑκάστῳ τῶν τέκνων στρέβλας.
13 Θεωρεῖτε δὲ πῶς πολυτέκνως ἐστιν ἡ τῆς φιλοτεκνίας στοργή, ἕλ-
14 κουσα πάντα πρὸς τὴν τῶν σπλάγχνων συμπάθειαν. Ὅπου γε
καὶ τὰ ἄλογα ζῶα ὁμοίαν τὴν πρὸς τὰ ἐξ αὑτῶν γεννώμενα συμ-
15 πάθειαν καὶ στοργὴν ἔχει τοῖς ἀνθρώποις. Καὶ γὰρ τῶν πετεινῶν,
τὰ μὲν ἡμερα κατὰ τὰς οἰκίας ὀροφοιτοῦντα προασπίζει τῶν
16 νεοττῶν. Τὰ δὲ κατὰ τὰς κορυφὰς ὀρέων καὶ φαράγγων ἀποῤῥά-
γας καὶ δένδρων ὁπὰς καὶ τὰς τούτων ἄκρας νοσσοποινησάμενα
17 ἀποτίκτει, καὶ τὸν προσιόντα κωλύει. Εἰ δὲ καὶ μὴ δύναιντο κω-
λύειν, περιπτάμενα κυκλόθεν αὑτῶν ἀλγοῦντα τῇ στοργῇ, ἀνα-
καλούμενα τῇ ἰδίᾳ φωνῇ, καθ᾿ ὃν δύναται τρόπον βοηθεῖ τοῖς τέ-
18 κνοις. Καὶ τί δεῖ τὴν διὰ τῶν ἀλόγων ζώων ἐπιδεικνύναι τὴν πρὸς
19 τὰ τέκνα συμπάθειαν. Ὅπου γε καὶ μέλισσαι περὶ τὸν τῆς κη-
ρογονίας καιρὸν ἐπικυνοῦνται τοὺς προσιόντας, καὶ καθάπερ σι-
δήρῳ τῷ κέντρῳ πλήσσουσι τοὺς προσιόντας τῇ νοσσιᾷ αὑτῶν,
20 καὶ ἐπαμύνονται ἕως θανάτου. Ἀλλ᾿ οὐχὶ τὴν τοῦ Ἀβραὰμ ἐμό-
ψυχον τῶν νεανίων μητέρα μετεκίνησεν συμπάθεια τῶν τέκνων.

**CHAPTER XIV.**

For even as hands and feet are moved in unison by the soul’s prime impulses,
**7** even so those sacred youths, being moved as by one immortal soul, [that is,] of piety, did consent unto death for her sake.
**8** O most holy septet of harmonious brethren! For even as the seven days of the world’s creation [were ordered] concerning piety;
**9** so the youths, as if dancing about the septet, did encompass the, yea, the linen fear, destroying [it]. Now we, hearing the tribulation of those youths, do tremble; but they, not only witnessing, nor only hearing the instant word of threat, but also suffering, did endure, yea, even this in the pains of fire.
**10** For what could be more grievous than these things? For sharp and swift is the power of fire,
**11** which quickly did dissolve the bodies. And deem it not a marvel, if reason did prevail over those men amidst their torments, seeing that even a woman’s mind did disdain [yet] more manifold pains.
**12** For the mother of those seven youths endured the tortures [inflicted] upon each one of her children.
**13** But behold how abundant is the affection of motherly love, drawing all things unto the compassion of the heart.
**14** Seeing that even the irrational beasts do bear a like compassion and affection toward their own offspring as do men.
**15** For even of the winged creatures, some, the tame, that dwell upon the rooftops about the houses, do protect their young.
**16** But others, having built their nests upon the peaks of mountains, and in the clefts of ravines, and in the hollows of trees, and upon the highest branches thereof,
**17** do bring forth [their young], and do hinder him that draws nigh. But if they be unable to hinder, flying round about them, grieving in their love, calling out with their own voice, in whatsoever wise they are able, they do succor their young.
**18** And what need is there to demonstrate, through the irrational beasts, the compassion toward their children?
**19** Seeing that even bees, at the season of making honeycomb, do grow fierce towards those who draw nigh, and as with iron do strike with their sting those who approach their nest,
**20** and do defend themselves even unto death. But not even the compassion for her children did move the Abraham-souled mother of the youths.
