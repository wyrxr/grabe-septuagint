**ΣΟΦΙΑ ΚΕΦ. Ζ'. Η'.**

**28.** ζεῖ οὐδένα γὰρ ὁ Θεὸς ἀγαπᾷ, εἰ μὴ τὸν σοφίᾳ συνοικοῦντα.
**29.** Ἔστι γὰρ αὕτη εὐπρεπεστέρα ἡλίου, καὶ ὑπὲρ πᾶσαν ἀστέρων θέσιν
**30.** φωτὶ συγκρινομένη εὑρίσκεται προτέρα· τοῦτο μὲν γὰρ διαδέχεται νύξ, σοφίαν δὲ οὐ κατισχύει κακία.

**ΚΕΦ. Η'. VIII.**

**1.** ΔΙΑΤΗΙΝΕΙ δὲ ἀπὸ πέρατος ἐπὶ πέρας εὐρώστως, καὶ διοικεῖται τὰ πάντα χρηστῶς.
**2.** Ταύτην ἐφίλησα καὶ ἐξεζήτησα ἐκ νεότητός μου, καὶ ἐζήτησα νύμφην ἀγαγέσθαι ἐμαυτῷ, καὶ ἐραστὴς ἐγενόμην τοῦ κάλλους αὐτῆς.
**3.** Εὐγένειαν δοξάζει συμβίωσιν Θεοῦ ἔχουσα, καὶ ὁ πάντων δεσπότης ἠγάπησεν αὐτήν·
**4.** μύστις γάρ ἐστι τῆς τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐπιστήμης, καὶ εὑρέτις τῶν ἔργων αὐτοῦ.
**5.** Εἰ δὲ πλοῦτός ἐστιν ἐπιθυμητὸν κτῆμα ἐν βίῳ, τί σοφίας πλουσιώτερον τῆς τὰ πάντα ἐργαζομένης;
**6.** Εἰ δὲ φρόνησις ἐράζεται, τίς αὐτῆς τῶν ὄντων μᾶλλόν ἐστι τεχνίτης;
**7.** Καὶ εἰ δικαιοσύνην ἀγαπᾷ τις, οἱ πόνοι ταύτης εἰσὶν ἀρεταί· σωφροσύνην γὰρ καὶ φρόνησιν ἐκδιδάσκει, δικαιοσύνην καὶ ἀνδρίαν, ὧν χρησιμώτερον οὐδέν ἐστιν ἐν βίῳ ἀνθρώποις.
**8.** Εἰ δὲ καὶ πολυπειρίαν ποθεῖ τις, οἶδε τὰ ἀρχαῖα, καὶ τὰ μέλλοντα εἰκάζει· ἐπίσταται στροφὰς λόγων καὶ λύσεις αἰνιγμάτων, σημεῖα καὶ τέρατα προγινώσκει καὶ ἐκβάσεις καιρῶν καὶ χρόνων.
**9.** Ἔκρινα τοίνυν ἀγαγέσθαι ταύτην ἐμαυτῷ πρὸς συμβίωσιν, εἰδὼς ὅτι ἔσαι μοι σύμβουλος ἀγαθῶν, καὶ παραίνεσις φροντίδων καὶ λύπης.
**10.** Ἕξω δ᾽ αὐτὴν δόξαν ἐν ὄχλοις, καὶ τιμὴν παρὰ πρεσβυτέροις·
**11.** ὁ νέος ὀξὺς εὑρεθήσομαι ἐν κρίσει, καὶ ἐν ὄψει δυναστῶν θαυμασθήσομαι·
**12.** σιγῶντά με περιμενοῦσι, καὶ φθεγγομένου προσέξουσι, καὶ λαλοῦντος ἐπιπλέον, χεῖρα ἐπιθήσουσιν ἐπὶ στόμα αὐτῶν.
**13.** Ἕξω δ᾽ αὐτὴν ἀθανασίαν, καὶ μνήμην αἰώνιον τοῖς μετ᾽ ἐμὲ ἀπολείψω.
**14.** Διοικήσω λαούς, καὶ ἔθνη ὑποταγήσεταί μοι·
**15.** φοβηθήσονται με ἀκούσαντες τύραννοι φρικτοί· ἐν πλήθει φανοῦμαι ἀγαθός, καὶ ἐν πολέμῳ ἀνδρεῖος·
**16.** εἰσελθὼν εἰς τὸν οἶκόν μου προσαναπαύσομαι αὐτῇ· οὐ γὰρ ἔχει πικρίαν ἡ συναναστροφὴ αὐτῆς, οὐδὲ ὀδύνην ἡ συμβίωσις αὐτῆς, ἀλλὰ εὐφροσύνην καὶ χαράν.
**17.** Ταῦτα λογισάμενος ἐν ἐμαυτῷ, καὶ φροντίσας ἐν καρδίᾳ μου, ὅτι ἀθανασία ἐστὶν ἐν συγγενείᾳ σοφίας, καὶ ἐν φιλίᾳ αὐτῆς τέρψις ἀγαθή, καὶ ἐν πόνοις

**CHAPTER VII.**

**28** [She] liveth: for God loveth no man, but him that dwelleth with Wisdom.
**29** For she is more beautiful than the sun, and above all the array of the stars;
**30** when compared with light, she is found to be superior; for night succeedeth this [light], but wickedness doth not prevail against Wisdom.

**CHAPTER VIII.**

**1** Now she **stretchèth forth** from one end to another mightily, and doth administer all things graciously.
**2** Her have I loved and sought out from my youth, and I desired to take her as a bride for myself, and I became a lover of her beauty.
**3** Her nobility doth she glorify, having communion with God; and the Lord of all things hath loved her.
**4** For she is initiated into the knowledge of God, and is a discoverer of His works.
**5** If then wealth be a possession to be desired in life, what is richer than Wisdom, which worketh all things?
**6** And if understanding **be desired**, who is a greater artificer of existing things than she?
**7** And if any man love righteousness, her labors are virtues; for she teacheth temperance and prudence, righteousness and fortitude, than which nothing is more profitable for men in life.
**8** And if any man long for much experience, she knoweth the things of old, and surmiseth the things to come; she understandeth the turns of discourse and the solutions of riddles, she foreknoweth signs and wonders and the issues of seasons and of times.
**9** Therefore did I determine to take her unto myself for companionship, knowing that she **shall be** for me a good counselor, and a solace for cares and sorrow.
**10** And I shall have glory through her among the multitudes, and honor among the elders.
**11** Being young, I shall be found keen in judgment, and in the sight of potentates shall I be admired.
**12** When I am silent, they shall wait for me; and when I speak, they shall hearken unto me; and when I speak yet more, they shall lay their hand upon their mouth.
**13** And I shall have through her immortality, and I shall leave an eternal memory to those after me.
**14** I shall govern peoples, and nations shall be subject unto me.
**15** Fearful tyrants shall fear me when they hear [of me]; among the multitude shall I appear good, and in war, valiant.
**16** When I enter into my house, I shall rest myself with her; for her company hath no bitterness, neither her dwelling together [with me] any pain, but rather joy and gladness.
**17** These things having I considered within myself, and having pondered in my heart, that there is immortality in kinship with Wisdom, and in her friendship a good delight, and in labors—
