μὴ νομίσητε παράδοξον εἶναι, ἐπεὶ καὶ ἔχθρας ὁ λογισμὸς ἐπικρατεῖν δύναται 13
διὰ τὸν νόμον, μηδὲ δενδροτομῶν τὰ ἥμερα τῶν πολεμίων φυτά, 14
τὰ δὲ τῶν ἐχθρῶν τοῖς ἀπολέσασιν διασώζων, καὶ τὰ πεπτωκώ-
τα συνεγείρων. Καὶ τῶν βιαιοτέρων δὲ παθῶν ἐπικρατεῖν ὁ λογισμὸς 15
φαίνεται, φιλαρχίας, καὶ κενοδοξίας, καὶ ἀλαζονείας, καὶ μεγαλαυχίας, καὶ
βλακανίας. Πάντα γὰρ ταῦτα τὰ κακοήθη 16
πάθη ὁ σώφρων νοῦς εἰς ἀγαθὸν προτρέπων ἀπωθεῖται καὶ βιά-
ζεται, ὥσπερ καὶ τὸν θυμὸν καὶ γὰρ τοῦτο δεσπόζει. Θυμού- 17
μενος γέ τοι Μωυσῆς κατὰ Δαβὰν καὶ Ἀβειρὼν, οὐ θυμῷ τι κατ’
αὐτῶν ἐποίησεν, ἀλλὰ λογισμῷ τὸν θυμὸν διήτησεν. Δυνατὸς γὰρ 18
ὁ σώφρων νοῦς, ὡς ἔφην, κατὰ τῶν παθῶν ἀριστεῦσαι, καὶ τὰ
μὲν αὐτῶν μεταθεῖναι, τὰ δὲ καὶ ἀκυρῶσαι. Ἐπεὶ διατὶ ὁ πάν- 19
σοφος ἡμῶν πατὴρ Ἰακὼβ τοὺς περὶ Συμεὼν καὶ Λευῒν αἰτιᾶ-
ται, μὴ λογισμῷ τοὺς Σικιμίτας ἐθνηδὸν ἀποσφάξαντας, λέγων,
ἐπικατάρατος ὁ θυμὸς αὐτῶν; Εἰ μὴ γὰρ ἐδύνατο τοῦ θυμοῦ ὁ 20
λογισμὸς κρατεῖν, οὐκ ἂν εἶπεν οὕτως. Ὁπηνίκα γὰρ ὁ Θεὸς τὸν 21
ἄνθρωπον κατεσκεύαζε λόγῳ, τὰ πάθη αὐτῷ καὶ τὰ ἤθη περιε-
φύτευεν. Καὶ τηνικαῦτα δὲ περὶ πάντων τὸν ἱερὸν ἡγεμόνα νοῦν 22
διὰ τῶν ἔνδον αἰσθητηρίων ἐνεθρόνισε· καὶ τούτῳ νόμον ἔδωκε, 23
καθ’ ὃν πολιτευόμενος βασιλεύσει βασιλείαν σώφρονά τε, καὶ δι-
καίαν, καὶ ἀγαθὴν, καὶ ἀνδρείαν. Πῶς οὖν, εἴποι τις ἂν, εἰ τῶν 24
παθῶν ὁ λογισμὸς κρατεῖ, λήθης καὶ ἀγνοίας οὐ κρατεῖ;

ΚΕΦ. Γ'. III.

ΕΣΤΙ δὲ κομιδῇ γελοῖος ὁ λόγος. οὐ γὰρ τῶν ἑαυτοῦ πα- 1
θῶν ὁ λογισμὸς ἐπικρατεῖν φαίνεται, ἀλλὰ τῶν σωματικῶν. Οἷον 2
ἐπιθυμίαν τις ὑμῶν οὐ δύναται ἐκκόψαι, ἀλλὰ μὴ δουλωθῆναι τῇ
ἐπιθυμίᾳ δύναται ὁ λογισμὸς παραχέσθαι. Θυμόν τις οὐ δύνα- 3
ται ἐκκόψαι ἡμῶν τῆς ψυχῆς, ἀλλὰ τῷ θυμῷ δυνατὸν βοηθῆσαι.
Κακοήθειάν τις ἡμῶν οὐ δύναται ἐκκόψαι, ἀλλὰ τὸ μὴ καμφθῆ- 4
ναι τῇ κακοηθείᾳ δύναται ὁ λογισμὸς συμμαχῆσαι. Οὐ γὰρ ἐκ- 5
ριζωτὴς τῶν παθῶν ὁ λογισμὸς ἐστιν, ἀλλ’ ἀνταγωνιστής. Ἔστιν 6
γοῦν τοῦτο διὰ τῆς Δαυεὶδ τοῦ βασιλέως δίψης σαφέστερον ἐπι-
λογίσασθαι. Ἐπεὶ γὰρ δι’ ὅλης ἡμέρας προσβαλὼν τοῖς ἀλλοφύ- 7
λοις ὁ Δαυίδ , πολλοὺς αὐτῶν ἀπέκτεινεν μετὰ τῶν τοῦ ἔθνους

**CHAPTER II.**

**13** And think not that it is a paradox, for Reason is able to prevail over enmities
through the Law, nor cutting down the tame plants of [our] enemies;
**14** but preserving the goods of our foes for them that have lost, and raising up the fallen.
**15** And Reason is seen to prevail over the more violent passions: [even] ambition, and vainglory, and boastfulness, and
**16** arrogance, and foolishness. For all these malevolent passions doth the temperate mind thrust away and compel unto good,
**17** even as it doth also master wrath. For though Moses was wroth against Dathan and Abiram, yet did he not do anything against them out of wrath,
but by Reason did he govern his wrath.
**18** For mighty is the temperate mind, as I said, to contend valiantly against the passions, and some of them to transform, and others to annul.
**19** For wherefore doth our all-wise father Jacob blame those concerning Simeon and Levi, who slew the Shechemites as a nation, not by Reason, saying,
**20** "Accursed be their wrath"? For if Reason were not able to prevail over wrath, he would not have spoken thus.
**21** For when God did fashion Man by the Word, He did plant within him passions and dispositions.
**22** And at that time, over all things, He enthroned the sacred leader, Mind,
**23** through the inner senses; and unto this [Mind] He gave Law, according to which, living, it shall reign with a kingdom both temperate, and just, and good, and courageous.
**24** How then, might one say, if Reason doth prevail over passions, doth it not prevail over forgetfulness and ignorance?

**CHAPTER III.**

**1** But this argument is entirely ridiculous. For Reason doth not seem to prevail over its own passions, but over those of the body.
**2** For example, none of you can cut out desire, but Reason is able to furnish [the strength] not to be enslaved by desire.
**3** None of us can cut out wrath from our soul, but it is possible to aid against wrath.
**4** None of us can cut out malice, but Reason is able to contend [for us] that we be not bent by malice.
**5** For Reason is not a root-extractor of the passions, but a contender against them.
**6** It is possible, then, to perceive this more clearly through the thirst of David the king.
**7** For when David, having fought for the whole day against the Philistines, did slay many of them with those of the nation [soldiers],
