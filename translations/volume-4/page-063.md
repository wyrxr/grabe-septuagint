38 υἱοὶ Δακλὰν τοῦ υἱοῦ τοῦ Βαενὰν, υἱοὶ Νεκωδὰν ἑξακόσιοι πεντηκονταδύο. Καὶ ἐκ τῶν ἱερέων οἱ ἐμποιούμενοι ἱερωσύνης, καὶ οὐχ εὑρέθησαν. υἱοὶ Ὀβδία, υἱοὶ Ἀκκὼς, υἱοὶ Ἰοδδοῦς τοῦ λαβόντος Αὐγίαν γυναῖκα τῶν θυγατέρων Ζορζελλαίου, καὶ ἐκλήθη ἐπὶ τῷ
39 ὀνόματι αὐτοῦ. Καὶ τούτων ζητηθείσης τῆς γενικῆς γραφῆς ἐν τῷ καταλογισμῷ, καὶ μὴ εὑρεθείσης, ἐχωρίσθησαν τοῦ ἱερατεύειν.
40 Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς Νεεμίας καὶ Ἀθαρίας, μὴ μετέχειν τῶν ἁγίων αὐτοῦς, ἕως οὗ ἀναστῇ ἀρχιερεὺς ἐνδεδυμένος τὴν δήλωσιν καὶ τὴν ἀλήθειαν.
41 Οἱ δὲ πάντες ἦσαν Ἰσραὴλ ἀπὸ δωδεκαετοῦς καὶ ἐπάνω χωρὶς παίδων καὶ παιδισκῶν, μυριάδες τέσσαρες δισχίλιοι τριακόσιοι ἑξήγοντα. παῖδες τούτων καὶ παιδίσκαι ἑπτακισχίλιοι τριακόσιοι τριακονταεπτά. ψάλται καὶ ψαλτωδοὶ, διακόσιοι τεσσαρακονταπέντε.
42 Καὶ κάμηλοι τετρακόσιοι τριακονταπέντε, καὶ ἵπποι ἑπτακισχίλιοι τριακονταέξ, ἡμίοι· διακόσιοι τεσσαρακονταπέντε, ὑποζύγια πεντακισχίλια πεντακόσια εἰκοσιπέντε.
43 Καὶ ἐκ τῶν ἡγουμένων κατὰ τὰς πατριὰς, ἐν τῷ παραγένεσθαι αὐτοὺς εἰς τὸ ἱερὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ, τὸ ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, ηὔξαντο ἐγεῖραι τὸν οἶκον ἐπὶ τοῦ τόπου αὐτοῦ κατὰ τὴν αὑτῶν δύναμιν,
44 καὶ δοῦναι εἰς τὸ ἱερὸν γαζοφυλάκιον τῶν ἔργων, χρυσίου μνᾶς χιλίας, καὶ ἀργυρίου μνᾶς πεντακισχιλίας, καὶ στολὰς ἱερατικὰς ἑκατόν.
45 Καὶ κατωκίσθησαν οἱ ἱερεῖς, καὶ οἱ Λευῖται, καὶ οἱ ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ καὶ τῇ χώρᾳ, οἵ τε ἱεροψάλται, καὶ οἱ θυρωροὶ, καὶ πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ ἐν ταῖς κώμαις αὑτῶν.
46 Ἐνστάντος δὲ τοῦ ἑβδόμου μηνὸς, καὶ ὄντων τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ ἑκάστου ἐν τοῖς ἰδίοις, συνήχθησαν ὁμοθυμαδὸν εἰς τὸ εὐρύχωρον τοῦ πρώτου πυλῶνος τοῦ πρὸς τὴν ἀνατολήν.
47 Καὶ καταστὰς Ἰησοῦς ὁ τοῦ Ἰωσεδὲκ καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὑτοῦ οἱ ἱερεῖς, καὶ Ζοροβάβελ ὁ τοῦ Σαλαθιὴλ καὶ οἱ τούτου ἀδελφοὶ, ἡτοίμασαν τὸ θυσιαστήριον τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ Ἰσραήλ,
48 προσενέγκαι ἐπ’ αὐτὸ ὁλοκαυτώσεις ἀκολούθως τοῖς ἐν τῇ Μωϋσέως βίβλῳ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τοῦ Θεοῦ διηγορευμένοις.
49 Καὶ ἐπισυνήχθησαν αὐτοῖς ἐκ τῶν ἄλλων ἐθνῶν τῆς γῆς, καὶ κατώρθωσαν τὸ θυσιαστήριον ἐπὶ τοῦ τόπου αὐτοῦ, ὅτι ἐν ἔχθρᾳ ἦσαν αὐτοῖς, καὶ κατίσχυσαν αὐτοῦς πάντα τὰ ἔθνη τὰ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς· καὶ ἀνέφερον θυσίας κατὰ τὸν καιρὸν, καὶ ὁλοκαυτώματα τῷ Κυρίῳ, τὸ πρωϊνὸν καὶ τὸ δειλινόν.
50 Καὶ ἠγάγασαν τὴν τῆς σκηνοπηγίας ἑορτὴν, ὡς ἐπιτέτακται ἐν τῷ νόμῳ, καὶ θυσίας καθ’ ἡμέραν, ὡς προσῆκον ἦν.

**Chapter V.**
**The Priest.**

**38** The sons of Daklan, of the son of Baenan; the sons of Nekodan, six hundred and fifty-two. And from among the priests, those who asserted their right to the priesthood, yet were not found [in the register]: the sons of Obdia, the sons of Akkos, the sons of Ioddoos, who took Augia as wife from among the daughters of Zorzellaios, and was called by his name.

**39** And when their general registry was sought in the register, and it was not found, they were removed from [performing] priestly service.

**40** And Nehemiah and Atharias said unto them, that they should not partake of the holy things, until there should arise a high priest clothed with the manifestation and the truth.

**41** Now all of Israel, from twelve years old and above, besides the children and maidservants, were forty-two thousand three hundred and sixty. Their children and maidservants were seven thousand three hundred and thirty-seven. The singers and songstresses were four hundred and forty-five.

**42** And camels, four hundred and thirty-five; and horses, seven thousand and thirty-six; mules, two hundred and forty-five; [and other] beasts of burden, five thousand five hundred and twenty-five.

**43** And some of the heads of the fathers' houses, when they came unto the temple of God, which is in Jerusalem, vowed to raise up the house upon its place, according to their own strength,

**44** and to give unto the sacred treasury of the works, one thousand minas of gold, and five thousand minas of silver, and one hundred priestly garments.

**45** And the priests, and the Levites, and those of the people, were settled in Jerusalem and in the country, both the temple singers, and the gatekeepers, and all Israel in their villages.

**46** Now when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were each in their own dwellings, they gathered together with one accord into the wide space of the first gate, which is toward the east.

**47** And Jesus the son of Josedek stood forth, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and his brethren, and they prepared the altar of the God of Israel,

**48** to offer burnt offerings upon it, according to that which is recounted in the book of Moses, the man of God.

**49** And they were gathered unto them, [even those returning] from among the other nations of the earth, and they established the altar upon its place, for they were in enmity with them, and all the nations that were upon the earth had prevailed against them; and they offered sacrifices according to the appointed time, and burnt offerings unto the Lord, both the morning and the evening [sacrifice].

**50** And they kept the Feast of Tabernacles, as it is commanded in the Law, and daily sacrifices, as was fitting.
