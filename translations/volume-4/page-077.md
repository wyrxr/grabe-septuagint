πυλῶνος εὐρυχώρου, ἐξ ὄρθρου ἕως μέσου ἡμέρας, ἐνώπιον ἀνδρῶν
τε καὶ γυναικῶν, καὶ ἐπέδωκαν πᾶν τὸ πλῆθος τὸν νοῦν εἰς τὸν
**42** νόμον. Καὶ ἔστη Ἔζρας ὁ ἱερεὺς καὶ ἀναγνώστης τοῦ νόμου ἐπὶ
**43** τοῦ ξυλίνου βήματος τοῦ κατασκευασθέντος. Καὶ ἔστησαν παρ᾽
αὐτῷ Ματταθίας, Σαμμοῦς, καὶ Ἀνανίας, Ἀζαρίας, Οὐρίας, Ἑζεκίας, Βαάλσαμος ἐκ δεξιῶν.
**44** Καὶ ἐξ εὐωνύμων Φαλδαῖος, Μισαήλ, Μελχίας, Λωθάσουβος, Ναβαρίας, Ζαχαρίας.
**45** Καὶ ἀναλαβὼν Ἔζρας τὸ βιβλίον τοῦ νόμου ἐνώπιον τοῦ πλήθους, προεκάθητο γὰρ ἐπιδόξως ἐνώπιον πάντων, καὶ ἐν τῷ λῦσαι τὸν
**46** νόμον, πάντες ὀρθοὶ ἔστησαν. Καὶ ηὐλόγησεν Ἔζρας τῷ Κυρίῳ Θεῷ τῷ ὑψίστῳ, Θεῷ Σαβαὼθ παντοκράτορι, καὶ ἐπεφώνησε πᾶν τὸ πλῆθος, ἀμήν.
**47** Καὶ ἄραντες ἄνω τὰς χεῖρας, προσπεσόντες ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, προσεκύνησαν τῷ Κυρίῳ.
**48** Ἰησοῦς, καὶ Ἀννοῦς, καὶ Σαραβίας, Ἰαδινός, Ἰάκουβος, Σαββαταίας, Αὐταίας, Μαιάννας, καὶ Καλείτας, Ἀζαρίας, καὶ Ἰωζάβδος, καὶ Ἀνανίας, Φιαθάς, οἱ Λευῖται, ἐδίδασκον τὸν νόμον Κυρίου, καὶ πρὸς τὸ πλῆθος ἀνεγίνωσκον τὸν νόμον τοῦ Κυρίου, ἐμφυσιοῦντες ἅμα τὴν
**49** ἀνάγνωσιν. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἀθαράτης Ἔζρα τῷ ἀρχιερεῖ καὶ ἀναγνώστῃ καὶ τοῖς Λευίταις τοῖς διδάσκουσι τὸ πλῆθος ἐπὶ πάντας.
**50** Ἡ ἡμέρα αὕτη ἐστὶν ἁγία τῷ Κυρίῳ, καὶ πάντες ἔκλαιον ἐν τῷ
**51** ἀκοῦσαι τοῦ νόμου. Βαδίσαντες οὖν φάγετε λιπάσματα, καὶ πίετε γλυκάσματα, καὶ ἀποστείλατε ἀποστολὰς τοῖς μὴ ἔχουσιν.
**52** Ἁγία γὰρ ἡ ἡμέρα τῷ Κυρίῳ, μὴ λυπεῖσθε. ὁ γὰρ Θεὸς Κύριος
**53** δοξάσει ὑμᾶς. Καὶ οἱ Λευῖται ἐκέλευον παντὶ τῷ δήμῳ, λέγοντες.
**54** Ἡ ἡμέρα αὕτη ἁγία, μὴ λυπεῖσθε. Καὶ ὤχοντο πάντες φαγεῖν καὶ
πιεῖν καὶ εὐφραίνεσθαι, καὶ δοῦναι ἀποστολὰς τοῖς μὴ ἔχουσι,
**55** καὶ εὐφρανθῆναι μεγάλως, ὅτι ἐνεφυσιώθησαν ἐν τοῖς ῥήμασιν οἷς
ἐδιδάχθησαν, καὶ ἐπισυνήχθησαν.

of the broad place of the gate, from the break of day even unto the midday, before both men and women; and all the multitude gave their minds unto the Law.

**42** And Ezra the priest and reader of the Law stood upon the wooden pulpit which was made.

**43** And there stood by him, at his right hand, Mattathias, Sammous, and Ananias, Azarias, Ourias, Hezekias, Baal-samos.

**44** And at his left hand, Phaldaios, Misal, Melchias, Lothasoubos, Nabarias, Zacharias.

**45** And when Ezra took up the book of the Law before the multitude— for he did sit gloriously before all — and at the opening of the Law, all stood upright.

**46** And Ezra blessed the Lord, the most High God, the God of Sabaoth, the Almighty; and all the multitude answered, "Amen."

**47** And lifting up their hands, they fell down upon the earth and worshipped the Lord.

**48** Jesus, and Annous, and Sarabias, Iadinos, Iacobos, Sabbataias, Autaias, Maiannas, and Kaleitas, Azarias, and Iozabdos, and Ananias, Phiathas, the Levites, taught the Law of the Lord; and unto the multitude they read the Law of the Lord, breathing [spiritual] life into the reading thereof.

**49** And Atharates said unto Ezra the high priest and reader, and unto the Levites who taught the multitude, even unto all [the people]:

**50** "This day is holy unto the Lord." For all the people wept when they heard the Law.

**51** "Go ye then, and eat of the fat, and drink of the sweet, and send portions unto them who have nought."

**52** "For the day is holy unto the Lord; grieve ye not. For the Lord God shall glorify you."

**53** And the Levites charged all the people, saying:

**54** "This day is holy; grieve ye not." And all went their way to eat, and to drink, and to make merry; and to send portions unto them who had nought;

**55** and to rejoice greatly, because they were inspired by the words which they had been taught, and were assembled.
