ΚΕΦ. Θʹ. ΙΧ.
1 ΙΟΥΔΙΘ δὲ ἔπεσεν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον, καὶ ἐπέθετο σποδὸν ἐπὶ τὴν
κεφαλὴν αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐγύμνωσεν ὃν ἐνεδιδύσκετο σάκκον. καὶ ἦν
ἄρτι προσφερόμενον ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Κυρίου τὸ
θυμίαμα τῆς ἑσπέρας ἐκείνης· καὶ ἐβόησε φωνῇ μεγάλῃ Ἰουδὶθ πρὸς
Κύριον, καὶ εἶπε·
2 Κύριε ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ πατρός μου Συμεών, ᾧ ἔδωκας ἐν χειρὶ ῥομφαίαν
εἰς ἐκδίκησιν ἀλλογενῶν, οἳ ἔλυσαν μήτραν παρθένου εἰς μίασμα,
καὶ ἐγύμνωσαν μηρὸν εἰς αἰσχύνην, καὶ ἐβεβήλωσαν μήτραν εἰς ὄνειδος·
εἶπας γάρ, οὐχ οὕτως ἔσται, καὶ ἐποίησαν·
3 ἀνθ᾿ ὧν ἔδωκας ἄρχοντας αὐτῶν εἰς φόνον, καὶ τὴν στρωμνὴν
αὐτῶν, ἣ ἠδέσθη τὴν ἀπατηθεῖσαν, εἰς αἷμα· καὶ ἐπάταξας δούλους
ἐπὶ δυνάσταις, καὶ δυνάστας ἐπὶ θρόνους αὐτῶν.
4 Καὶ ἔδωκας γυναῖκας αὐτῶν εἰς προνομήν, καὶ θυγατέρας αὐτῶν
εἰς αἰχμαλωσίαν, καὶ πάντα τὰ σκῦλα αὐτῶν εἰς διαίρεσιν υἱῶν
ἠγαπημένων ὑπὸ σοῦ, οἳ καὶ ἐζήλωσαν τὸν ζῆλόν σου, καὶ ἐδελύζαντο
μίασμα αἵματος αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπεκαλέσαντό σε εἰς βοήθον.
Ὁ Θεὸς Θεὸς ἐμός, εἰσάκουσόν μου τῆς χήρας.
5 Σὺ γὰρ ἐποίησας τὰ πρότερα ἐκείνων, καὶ ἐκεῖνα, καὶ τὰ μετέπειτα,
καὶ τὰ νῦν, καὶ τὰ ἐπερχόμενα διενοήθης, καὶ ἐγενήθησαν ἃ ἐνενοήθης,
καὶ παρέστησαν ἃ ἐβουλεύσω, καὶ εἶπαν· ἰδοὺ πάρεσμεν.
6 πᾶσαι γὰρ αἱ ὁδοί σου ἕτοιμοι, καὶ ἡ κρίσις σου ἐν προγνώσει.
7 Ἰδοὺ γὰρ Ἀσσύριοι ἐπληθύνθησαν ἐν δυνάμει αὐτῶν, ὑψώθησαν
ἐφ᾿ ἵππῳ καὶ ἀναβάτῃ, ἐγαυρίασαν ἐν βραχίονι πεζῶν, ἤλπισαν
ἐν ἀσπίδι καὶ ἐν γαισῷ καὶ τόξῳ καὶ σφενδόνῃ, καὶ οὐκ ἔγνωσαν
ὅτι σὺ εἶ Κύριος συντρίβων πολέμους.
8 Κύριος ὄνομά σοι, σὺ ῥῆξον αὐτῶν τὴν ἰσχὺν ἐν δυνάμει σου,
καὶ κατάκοψον τὸ κράτος αὐτῶν ἐν τῷ θυμῷ σου. ἐβουλεύσαντο
γὰρ βεβηλῶσαι τὰ ἅγιά σου, μιᾶναι τὸ σκήνωμα τῆς καταπαύσεως
τοῦ ὀνόματος τῆς δόξης σου, καὶ καταβαλεῖν σιδήρῳ κέρας
θυσιαστηρίου σου.
9 Βλέψον εἰς ὑπερφανίαν αὐτῶν, ἀπόστειλον τὴν ὀργήν σου εἰς
κεφαλὰς αὐτῶν, δὸς ἐν χειρί μου τῆς χήρας ὃ διενοήθην κράτος,
10 πάταξον δοῦλον ἐκ χειλέων ἀπάτης μου ἐπ᾿ ἄρχοντι, καὶ ἄρχοντα
ἐπὶ θεράποντι αὐτοῦ, θραῦσον αὐτῶν τὸ ἀνάστημα ἐν χειρὶ θηλείας.
11 Οὐ γὰρ ἐν πλήθει τὸ κράτος σου, οὐδὲ ἡ δυναστεία σου ἐν ἰσχύουσιν, ἀλλὰ ταπει-

#### CHAPTER 9

1 Then Judith fell upon her face, and placed ashes upon her head, and stripped off the sackcloth which she had worn. And it was at that very hour that the evening incense was being offered in Jerusalem in the House of the Lord. And Judith cried out with a loud voice unto the Lord, and said:

2 "O Lord, God of my father Simeon, into whose hand Thou gavest the sword for the avenging of strangers, who loosened the womb of a virgin unto defilement, and uncovered the thigh unto shame, and defiled the womb unto reproach; for Thou didst say, 'It shall not be so,' yet they did it.

3 Therefore didst Thou give their rulers unto slaughter, and their very bed, which was shamed by the deceived one, unto blood; and Thou didst strike down servants upon princes, and princes upon their own thrones.

4 And Thou didst give their wives unto plunder, and their daughters unto captivity, and all their spoils unto division for the sons beloved by Thee, who also burned with Thy jealousy, and abhorred the defilement of their blood, and called upon Thee for a Helper. O God, my God, hearken unto me, a widow.

5 For Thou hast wrought the former things concerning them, and those things, and the things that came after, and the things that are now, and the things that are yet to come, Thou didst devise in Thy mind; and they came to pass as Thou didst conceive, and those things which Thou didst counsel stood forth, and they said, 'Behold, we are present!'

6 For all Thy ways are made ready, and Thy judgment is in foreknowledge.

7 For behold, the Assyrians are multiplied in their power, they are exalted upon horse and rider, they have boasted in the arm of their footmen, they have put their trust in shield and javelin and bow and sling, and they knew not that Thou art the Lord who shattereth wars.

8 Lord is Thy Name; do Thou break their strength in Thy might, and cut down their power in Thy wrath. For they have purposed to defile Thy holy things, to profane the tabernacle of the resting-place of the name of Thy glory, and to cast down with iron the horn of Thy altar.

9 Look upon their arrogance, send forth Thy wrath upon their heads; give into the hand of me, a widow, the power which I have purposed.

10 Strike down, by the lips of my deceit, a servant upon a ruler, and a ruler upon his own attendant; break their stature by the hand of a woman.

11 For not in multitude is Thy power, nor Thy might in them that are strong, but [Thou showest mercy unto] the lowly."
