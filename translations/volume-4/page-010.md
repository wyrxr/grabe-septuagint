ΚΕΦ. Ε.                ΤΩΒΙΤ                       1541
εἶπεν αὐτῷ· Ζήτησον σεαυτῷ ἄνθρωπον ὃς συμπορεύσεταί σοι, καὶ
δώσω αὐτῷ μισθὸν ἕως ζῶ, καὶ λάβῃ πορευθεὶς τὸ ἀργύριον.
Καὶ ἐπορεύθη ζητῆσαι ἄνθρωπον, καὶ εὗρε τὸν Ῥαφαὴλ ὃς ἦν 4
ἄγγελος, καὶ οὐκ ᾔδει. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· εἰ δύναμαι πορευθῆναι 5
μετὰ σοῦ ἐν Ῥάγοις τῆς Μηδίας, καὶ εἰ ἔμπειρος εἶ τῶν τόπων;
Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ ἄγγελος· πορεύσομαι μετὰ σοῦ, καὶ τῆς ὁδοῦ 6
ἔμπειρός, καὶ παρὰ Γαβαὴλ τὸν ἀδελφὸν ἡμῶν ἠυλίσθην. Καὶ 7
εἶπεν αὐτῷ Τωβίας· ὑπόμεινόν με, καὶ ἐρῶ τῷ πατρί μου. Καὶ 8
εἶπεν αὐτῷ· πορεύου, καὶ μὴ χρονίσῃς. Καὶ εἰσελθών, εἶπε τῷ 9
πατρί· ἰδοὺ εὕρηκα ὃς συμπορεύσεταί μοι. ὃ δὲ εἶπε· φώνησον αὐ-
τὸν πρός με, ἵνα ἐπιγνῶ ποίας φυλῆς ἐστι, καὶ εἰ πιστός ἐστι
τοῦ πορευθῆναι μετὰ σοῦ. Καὶ ἐκάλεσεν αὐτόν, καὶ εἰσῆλθε, καὶ 10
ἠσπάσαντο ἀλλήλους. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Τωβίτ· ἀδελφέ, ἐκ ποίας 11
φυλῆς καὶ ἐκ ποίας πατριᾶς σὺ εἶ; ὑπόδειξόν μοι. Καὶ εἶπεν 12
αὐτῷ· φυλὴν καὶ πατριὰν σὺ ζητεῖς; ἢ μίσθιον ὃς συμπορεύσε-
ταί μετὰ τοῦ υἱοῦ σου; Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Τωβίτ· βούλομαι, ἀ-
δελφέ, ἐπιγνῶναι τὸ γένος σου, καὶ τὸ ὄνομα. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἀ- 13
ζαρίας· Ἀνανίου τοῦ μεγάλου, τῶν ἀδελφῶν σου. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· 14
ὑγιαίνων ἔλθοις, ἀδελφέ, καὶ μή μοι ὀργισθῇς, ὅτι ἐζήτησα τὴν
φυλήν σου, καὶ τὴν πατριάν σου ἐπιγνῶναι, καὶ σὺ τυγχάνεις ἀ-
δελφός μου ἐκ τῆς καλῆς καὶ ἀγαθῆς γενεᾶς. ἐγίνωσκον γὰρ
ἐγὼ Ἀνανίαν καὶ Ἰωνάθαν τοὺς υἱοὺς Σεμείου τοῦ μεγάλου, ὡς
ἐπορευόμεθα κοινῶς εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα προσκυνεῖν, ἀναφέροντες τὰ
πρωτότοκα, καὶ τὰς δεκάτας τῶν γεννημάτων, καὶ οὐκ ἐπλανή-
θησαν τὴν πλάνην τῶν ἀδελφῶν ἡμῶν· ἐκ ῥίζης μεγάλης εἶ, ἀδελ-
φέ· ἀλλὰ εἰπόν μοι τίνα σοι ἔσομαι μισθὸν δίδοναι; δραχμὴν τῆς 15
ἡμέρας, καὶ τὰ δέοντά σοι ὡς καὶ τῷ υἱῷ μου, καὶ ἔτι προσθή- 16
σω σοι ἐπὶ τὸν μισθόν, ἐὰν ὑγιαίνοντες ἐπιστρέψητε. Καὶ εὐδό- 17
κησαν οὕτως. καὶ εἶπε πρὸς Τωβίαν· ἕτοιμος γίνου πρὸς τὴν ἔ-
ξοδον, καὶ εὐοδωθείητε. καὶ ἡτοίμασεν ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ τὰ πρὸς τὴν
ἔξοδον· καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ, πορεύου μετὰ τοῦ ἀνθρώ-
που τούτου· ὁ δὲ ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ κατοικῶν Θεὸς εὐοδώσει τὴν
ἔξοδόν ὑμῶν, καὶ ὁ ἄγγελος αὐτοῦ συμπορευθήτω ὑμῖν. καὶ ἐξῆλ-
θον ἀμφότεροι ἀπελθεῖν, καὶ ὁ κύων τοῦ παιδαρίου μετ᾿ αὐτῶν.
Ἐκλαυσε δὲ Ἄννα ἡ μήτηρ αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς Τωβίτ· τί 18
ἐξαπέστειλας τὸ παιδίον ἡμῶν; ἢ οὐχὶ ἡ ἔκδοσις τῆς χειρός ἡμῶν ἔστιν ἐν τῷ εἰσπορεύεσθαι αὐτὸν καὶ ἐκπορεύεσθαι ἐνώπιον ἡμῶν;

[Tobit 5:3]
And [Tobit] said unto him, "Seek for thyself a man who shall journey with thee, and I will give him wages whilst I live, and until thou shalt receive the silver, having gone [thither]."

[Tobit 5:4]
So he departed to seek a man, and he found Raphael, who was an angel, yet he knew it not.

[Tobit 5:5]
And [Tobias] said unto him, "Can I go with thee unto Rages of Media, and art thou skilled in these places?"

[Tobit 5:6]
And the angel said unto him, "I will go with thee, and I am acquainted with the way; for I have lodged with Gabael, our brother."

[Tobit 5:7]
Then Tobias said unto him, "Tarry for me, and I will speak unto my father."

[Tobit 5:8]
And he said unto him, "Go, and make no delay."

[Tobit 5:9]
So he went in, and said unto his father, "Behold, I have found one who will journey with me." And he [Tobit] said, "Call him unto me, that I may know of what tribe he is, and if he be faithful to go with thee."

[Tobit 5:10]
And [Tobias] called him, and he came in; and they saluted one another.

[Tobit 5:11]
And Tobit said unto him, "Brother, of what tribe and of what family art thou? Show me, I pray thee."

[Tobit 5:12]
And he answered him, "Seekest thou a tribe and a family? Or a hireling who shall go with thy son?"

[Tobit 5:13]
Then Tobit said unto him, "I desire, brother, to know thy lineage and thy name." And [the angel] said, "I am Azariah, of Ananias the great, from among thy brethren."

[Tobit 5:14]
And Tobit said unto him, "Mayest thou come in good health, brother; and be not wroth with me, because I sought to know thy tribe and thy family; for thou art indeed my brother of a good and noble generation. For I knew Ananias and Jonathan, the sons of Semeius the great, when we went together unto Jerusalem to worship, bringing our firstfruits and the tenths of our produce; and they erred not with the error of our brethren. Of a great root art thou, brother. But tell me, what wages shall I give unto thee?"

[Tobit 5:15]
"A drachma a day, and thy necessities even as for my son; and I shall yet add unto thy wages, if ye return in good health."

[Tobit 5:16]
And they agreed thus. And [Tobit] said unto Tobias, "Be ready for the journey, and may ye prosper." And his son made ready for the journey; and his father said unto him, "Go with this man; and the God who dwelleth in heaven shall prosper your journey, and His angel shall accompany you." And they both went forth to depart, and the boy's dog was with them.

[Tobit 5:17]
But Anna his mother wept, and said unto Tobit, "Why hast thou sent forth our child? Is he not the very solace of our hand, [being ever present] in his going in and going out before us?"
