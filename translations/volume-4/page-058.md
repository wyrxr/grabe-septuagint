ἐσίγησεν. Ὁ δὲ τρίτος ὁ εἰπὼν περὶ τῶν γυναικῶν καὶ τῆς ἀληθείας, 13
οὗτος ἐστὶ Ζοροβάβελ, ἤρξατο λαλεῖν. Ὦ ἄνδρες, οὐ μέγας ὁ 14
βασιλεύς, καὶ πολλοὶ οἱ ἄνθρωποι, καὶ ὁ οἶνος ἰσχύει; τίς οὖν ὁ
δεσπόζων αὐτῶν, ἢ τίς ὁ κυριεύων αὐτῶν; οὐχὶ αἱ γυναῖκες; Αἱ 15
γυναῖκες ἐγέννησαν τὸν βασιλέα καὶ πάντα τὸν λαὸν δὲ κυριεύει
τῆς θαλάσσης καὶ τῆς γῆς. καὶ ἐξ αὐτῶν ἐγένοντο, καὶ αὐταί ἐ- 16
ξέθρεψαν αὐτοὺς τοὺς φυτεύσαντας τοὺς ἀμπελῶνας ἐξ ὧν ὁ οἶνος
γίνεται· καὶ αὗται ποιοῦσι τὰς στολὰς τῶν ἀνθρώπων, καὶ αὗται 17
ποιοῦσι δόξαν τοῖς ἀνθρώποις, καὶ οὐ δύνανται οἱ ἄνθρωποι χωρὶς
τῶν γυναικῶν εἶναι. Ἐὰν δὲ συναγάγωσι χρυσίον καὶ ἀργύριον 18
καὶ πᾶν πρᾶγμα ὡραῖον, καὶ ἴδωσι γυναῖκα μίαν καλὴν τῷ εἴδει
καὶ τῷ κάλλει, καὶ ταῦτα πάντα ἀφέντες, εἰς αὐτὴν ἐγκέχηναν, 19
καὶ χάσκοντες τὸ στόμα θεωροῦσιν αὐτήν, καὶ πάντες αὐτὴν αἱ-
ρετίζουσι μᾶλλον ἢ τὸ χρυσίον καὶ τὸ ἀργύριον, καὶ πᾶν πρᾶγμα
ὡραῖον. Ἄνθρωπος τὸν ἑαυτοῦ πατέρα ἐγκαταλείπει ὃς ἐξέθρεψεν 20
αὐτόν, καὶ τὴν ἰδίαν χώραν, καὶ πρὸς τὴν ἰδίαν γυναῖκα κολλᾶ-
ται, καὶ μετὰ τῆς γυναικὸς ἀφήσει τὴν ψυχήν, καὶ οὔτε τὸν πα- 21
τέρα μέμνηται, οὔτε τὴν μητέρα, οὔτε τὴν χώραν. Καὶ ἐντεῦ- 22
θεν δεῖ ὑμᾶς γνῶναι, ὅτι αἱ γυναῖκες κυριεύουσιν ὑμῶν. οὐχὶ πο-
νεῖτε, καὶ μοχθεῖτε, καὶ πάντα ταῖς γυναιξὶ δίδοτε καὶ φέρετε;
Καὶ λαμβάνει ἄνθρωπος τὴν ζημίαν ἑαυτοῦ, καὶ ἐκπορεύεται 23
εἰς ἐξοδίαν ληστεύειν καὶ κλέπτειν, καὶ εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν πλεῖ
καὶ ποταμούς, καὶ τὸν λέοντα θεωρεῖ, καὶ ἐν σκότει βαδίζει. καὶ 24
ὅταν κλέψῃ καὶ ἁρπάσῃ καὶ λωποδυτήσῃ, τῇ ἐρωμένῃ ἀποφέρει.
Καὶ πλεῖον ἀγαπᾷ ἄνθρωπος τὴν ἰδίαν γυναῖκα μᾶλλον ἢ τὸν πα- 25
τέρα καὶ τὴν μητέρα. Καὶ πολλοὶ ἀπενοήθησαν ταῖς ἰδίαις δια- 26
νοίαις διὰ τὰς γυναῖκας, καὶ δοῦλοι ἐγένοντο δι᾽ αὐτάς. Καὶ πολ- 27
λοὶ ἀπώλοντο, καὶ ἐσφάλησαν, καὶ ἡμάρτοσκον διὰ τὰς γυναῖκας.
Καὶ νῦν οὐ πιστεύετέ μοι; οὐχὶ μέγας ὁ βασιλεὺς τῇ ἐξουσίᾳ 28
αὐτοῦ; οὐχὶ πᾶσαι αἱ χῶραι εὐλαβοῦνται αὐτὸν ἅψασθαι αὐτοῦ;
Ἐθεώρουν αὐτὸν καὶ Ἀπάμην τὴν θυγατέρα Βαρτάκου τοῦ θαυ- 29
μαστοῦ, τὴν παλλακὴν τοῦ βασιλέως, καθημένην ἐν δεξιᾷ τοῦ βα-
σιλέως, καὶ ἀφαιροῦσαν τὸ διάδημα ἀπὸ τῆς κεφαλῆς τοῦ βα- 30
σιλέως, καὶ ἐπιτιθοῦσαν ἑαυτῇ. καὶ ἐρράπιζε τὸν βασιλέα τῇ ἀ-
ριστερᾷ. Καὶ πρὸς τούτοις ὁ βασιλεὺς χάσκων τὸ στόμα ἐθεώρει 31
αὐτήν· καὶ ἂν προσεγελάσῃ αὐτῷ, γελᾷ. Ἐὰν δὲ πικρανθῇ ἐπ᾿ αὐ-

**Chapter IV.** (continued)

**13** And he held his peace. Then the third, he who had spoken concerning women and concerning truth, even Zorobabel, began to speak.
**14** "O men, is not the king mighty, and are not the people numerous, and doth not wine prevail? Who then is he that is master of them, or who is he that hath dominion over them? Is it not women?
**15** Women did bear the king, and all the people; and [the king] doth hold dominion over the sea and over the land.
**16** And from them were they born; and these very women did nourish them who planted the vineyards, whence the wine cometh.
**17** And these do make the raiment of men; and these do bring glory unto men. And men cannot be without women.
**18** But if they shall gather gold and silver, and every comely thing, and shall behold one woman fair in form and in beauty,
**19** then, having left all these things, they do gaze upon her, and with open mouth they behold her, and all do prefer her more than gold and silver, and every comely thing.
**20** A man doth forsake his own father, who nourished him, and his own country, and doth cleave unto his own wife;
**21** and with his wife he shall yield up his soul; and he doth remember neither father, nor mother, nor country.
**22** And from this ye ought to know that women have dominion over you. Do ye not toil, and do ye not labor, and do ye not give and bring all things unto women?
**23** And a man doth take upon himself his own loss, and goeth forth on an enterprise to rob and to steal; and he doth sail upon the sea and upon rivers,
**24** and he doth behold the lion, and doth walk in darkness. And when he hath stolen and hath plundered and hath stripped [another], he doth bring [it] unto his beloved.
**25** And a man doth love his own wife more than [his] father and [his] mother.
**26** And many have been driven to despair in their own minds because of women, and have become slaves by reason of them.
**27** And many have perished, and have been ruined, and did continually sin because of women.
**28** And now, do ye not believe me? Is not the king great in his authority? Do not all the lands fear to touch him?
**29** I did behold him and Apame, the daughter of Bartacus the marvellous, the concubine of the king, sitting on the right hand of the king,
**30** and taking the diadem from the king's head, and placing it upon herself. And she did slap the king with her left hand.
**31** And moreover, the king, with open mouth, did behold her; and if she did smile upon him, he would laugh. But if she were wroth with him,
