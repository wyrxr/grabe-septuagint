ΚΕΦ. Ι΄.
ἀπέστειλε πρὸς Ἰωνάθαν τὸν ἀρχιερέα, λέγων. Σὺ μονώτατος 70
ἐπαίρῃ ἐφ᾿ ἡμᾶς, ἐγὼ δὲ ἐγείρην εἰς καταγέλωτα καὶ ὀνειδι-
σμὸν διὰ σέ· καὶ διατί σὺ ἐξουσιάζῃ ἐφ᾿ ἡμᾶς ἐν τοῖς ὄρεσι;
Νῦν οὖν εἰ πέποιθας ἐπὶ ταῖς δυνάμεσί σου, κατάβηθι πρὸς ἡμᾶς 71
εἰς τὸ πεδίον, καὶ συγκριθῶμεν ἑαυτοῖς ἐκεῖ, ἔτι μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ ἐστι
δύναμις τῶν πόλεων. Ἐρώτησον καὶ μάθε τίς εἰμι καὶ οἱ λοι- 72
ποὶ οἱ βοηθοῦντες ἡμῖν· καὶ λέγουσιν, οὐκ ἔστιν ὑμῖν στάσις
ποδὸς κατὰ πρόσωπον ἡμῶν, ἔτι δὶς ἐτροπώθησαν οἱ πατέρες
σου ἐν τῇ γῇ αὐτῶν. Καὶ νῦν σὺ ἔνιψον ὑποστῆναι τὴν ἵππον καὶ 73
δύναμιν τοιαύτην ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ, ὅπου οὐκ ἔστι λίθος οὐδὲ κόχλαξ οὐ-
δὲ τόπος τοῦ φυγείν. Ὡς δὲ ἤκουσεν Ἰωνάθαν τῶν λόγων Ἀπολ- 74
λωνίου, ἐκινήθη τῇ διανοίᾳ, καὶ ἐπέλεξε δέκα χιλιάδας ἀνδρῶν,
καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ἐξ Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ συνήντησεν αὐτῷ Σίμων ὁ
ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ βοήθειαν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ παρενέβαλεν ἐπὶ Ἰόππην, 75
καὶ ἀπέκλεισαν αὐτὸν οἱ ἐκ τῆς πόλεως, ὅτι φρουρὰ Ἀπολλωνίου
ἐν Ἰόππῃ, καὶ ἐπολέμησαν αὐτήν. Καὶ φοβηθέντες ἤνοιξαν οἱ 76
ἐκ τῆς πόλεως, καὶ ἐκυρίευσεν Ἰωνάθαν Ἰόππης. Καὶ ἤκουσεν 77
Ἀπολλώνιος, καὶ παρενέβαλε τρισχιλίαν ἵππον καὶ δύναμιν πολ-
λήν, καὶ ἐπορεύθη εἰς Ἄζωτον ὡς διοδεύων, καὶ ἅμα προῆγεν
εἰς τὸ πεδίον, καὶ διὰ τὸ ἔχειν αὐτὸν πλῆθος ἵππου καὶ πεποι-
θέναι ἐπ᾿ αὐτῇ. Καὶ κατεδίωξεν Ἰωνάθαν ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ εἰς Ἄζω- 78
τον, καὶ συνῆψαν αἱ παρεμβολαὶ ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ εἰς πόλεμον. Καὶ 79
ἀπέλιπεν Ἀπολλώνιος χιλίαν ἵππον ἐν κρυπτῷ κατόπισθεν αὐ-
τοῦ. Καὶ ἔγνω Ἰωνάθαν ὅτι ἔστιν ἐνέδρον κατόπισθεν αὐτοῦ, 80
καὶ ἐκύκλωσαν αὐτοῦ τὴν παρεμβολήν, καὶ ἐξετίναξαν τὰς σχί-
ζας εἰς τὸν λαὸν ἐκ πρωΐθεν ἕως δείλης. Ὁ δὲ λαὸς εἰστήκει 81
καθὼς ἐπέταξεν Ἰωνάθαν, καὶ ἐποῖσαν οἱ ἵπποι αὐτῶν. Καὶ 82
εἵλκυσε Σίμων τὴν δύναμιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ συνῆψε πρὸς τὴν φάραγγα·
ἡ γὰρ ἵππος ἐξελύθη καὶ συνετρίφησαν ὑπ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔφυγαν.
Καὶ ἡ ἵππος ἐσκορπίσθη ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ, καὶ ἔφυγον εἰς Ἄζωτον, 83
καὶ εἰσῆλθον εἰς Βηθδαγὼν τὸ εἰδωλεῖον αὐτοῦ σωθῆναι. Καὶ 84
ἐνεπύρισεν Ἰωνάθαν τὴν Ἄζωτον καὶ τὰς πόλεις τὰς κύκλῳ
αὐτῆς, καὶ ἔλαβε τὰ σκῦλα αὐτῶν, καὶ τὸ ἱερὸν Δαγὼν καὶ τὸ
ἱερὸν αὐτῆς καὶ τοὺς συμφυγόντας εἰς αὐτὸ ἐνεπύρισεν ἐν πυρί.
Καὶ ἐγένοντο οἱ πεπτωκότες μαχαίρᾳ σὺν τοῖς ἐμπυρισθεῖσιν 85
εἰς ἄνδρας ὀκτακισχιλίους. Καὶ ἀπῆρεν ἐκεῖθεν Ἰωνάθαν, καὶ 86

**10:70** He sent unto Jonathan the high priest, saying: Thou alone liftest thyself up against us, but I have been raised unto derision and reproach because of thee. And wherefore dost thou bear rule over us in the mountains?
**10:71** Now therefore, if thou puttest thy trust in thy forces, come down unto us into the plain, and let us be tried one against another there, for the strength of the cities is yet with me.
**10:72** Inquire and learn what I am, and who are the rest that aid us; and [they will tell thee], ye have no foothold before our face. Yet twice were thy fathers put to flight in their own land.
**10:73** And now, do thou wash [thyself] to withstand such horsemen and a host in the plain, where there is no stone, nor pebble, nor place for flight.
**10:74** Now when Jonathan heard the words of Apollonius, he was stirred in his mind, and he chose ten thousand men, and went forth out of Jerusalem. And Simon his brother met him to aid him.
**10:75** Then he encamped against Joppa; and those of the city shut him out, for a garrison of Apollonius was in Joppa; and he made war against it.
**10:76** And they that were of the city, being afraid, opened [their gates]; and Jonathan took Joppa.
**10:77** And Apollonius heard thereof, and encamped with three thousand horse and a great host, and went unto Azotus as one that would pass through, and at the same time he advanced into the plain, because he had a multitude of horsemen and put his trust in them.
**10:78** And Jonathan pursued after him unto Azotus, and the forces joined battle behind him.
**10:79** And Apollonius left a thousand horse in secret behind him.
**10:80** And Jonathan knew that there was an ambush behind him; and they encompassed his camp, and cast their darts among the people from morning even until evening.
**10:81** But the people stood fast, as Jonathan had commanded, and their horsemen did [their part].
**10:82** Then Simon drew forth his forces, and joined battle at the ravine; for the cavalry was broken and crushed by him, and they fled.
**10:83** And the cavalry was scattered in the plain, and they fled unto Azotus, and entered into Beth-dagon, their idol-temple, to save themselves.
**10:84** And Jonathan set fire to Azotus and the cities round about it, and took their spoils; and the temple of Dagon, and its temple, and those who fled together into it, he burned with fire.
**10:85** And those who had fallen by the sword, with them that were burned with fire, were eight thousand men.
**10:86** And Jonathan departed thence, and encamped against Ashkelon; and those of the city came forth to meet him with great glory.
