11.12 ἐθνῶν, ἐγὼ δὲ συνετήρησα τὴν ψυχήν μου μὴ φαγεῖν, καθότι
13 ἐμεμνήμην τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐν ὅλῃ τῇ ψυχῇ μου. Καὶ ἔδωκεν ὁ ὕψι-
    στος χάριν καὶ μορφὴν ἐνώπιον Ἐνεμεσσάρου, καὶ ἤμην αὐτοῦ
14 ἀγοραστής, καὶ ἐπορευόμην εἰς τὴν Μηδίαν, καὶ παρεθέμην Γα-
    βήλῳ τῷ ἀδελφῷ Γαβρία ἐν Ῥάγοις τῆς Μηδίας ἀργυρίου τά-
15 λαντα δέκα. Καὶ ὅτε ἀπέθανεν Ἐνεμέσσαρος, ἐβασίλευσε Σεν-
    ναχηρεὶμ ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ αἱ ὁδοὶ αὐτοῦ ἠκαταστά-
16 θησαν, καὶ οὐκ ἔτι ἠδυνάσθην πορευθῆναι εἰς τὴν Μηδίαν. Καὶ
    ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις Ἐνεμεσσάρου ἐλεημοσύνας πολλὰς ἐποίουν τοῖς
17 ἀδελφοῖς μου. Τοὺς ἄρτους μου ἐδίδουν τοῖς πεινῶσι, καὶ τὰ
    ἱμάτιά μου τοῖς γυμνοῖς· καὶ εἴ τινα ἐκ τοῦ γένους μου ἐθεώ-
    ρουν τεθνηκότα καὶ ἐῤῥιμμένον ἐπὶ τοῦ τείχους εἰς Νινευῆ, ἔθα-
18 πτον αὐτόν. Καὶ εἴ τινα ἀπέκτεινε Σενναχηρεὶμ ὁ βασιλεύς, ὅτε
    ἦλθε φεύγων ἐκ τῆς Ἰουδαίας, ἔθαψα αὐτοὺς κλέπτων. πολλοὺς
    γὰρ ἀπέκτεινεν ἐν τῷ θυμῷ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐζητήθη ὑπὸ τοῦ βασι-
19 λέως τὰ σώματα, καὶ οὐχ εὑρέθη. Πορευθεὶς δὲ εἷς τῶν Νι-
    νευϊτῶν ὑπέδειξε τῷ βασιλεῖ περὶ ἐμοῦ ὅτι ἔθαπτον αὐτούς, καὶ
    ἐκρύβην. ἐπιγνοὺς δὲ ὅτι ζητοῦμαι ἀποθανεῖν, φοβηθεὶς ἀνεχώ-
20 ρησα. Καὶ διηρπάγη πάντα τὰ ὑπάρχοντά μου, καὶ οὐ κατε-
    λείφθη μοι οὐδέν, πλὴν Ἄννας τῆς γυναικός μου, καὶ Τωβίου
21 τοῦ υἱοῦ μου. Καὶ οὐ διῆλθον ἡμέραι πεντήκοντα, ἕως οὗ ἀπέ-
    κτειναν αὐτὸν οἱ δύο υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἔφυγον εἰς τὰ ὄρη Ἀραράτ,
    καὶ ἐβασίλευσε Σαχερδὰν ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔταξεν
    Ἀχιάχαρον τὸν Ἀναὴλ τὸν υἱὸν τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ μου ἐπὶ πᾶσαν τὴν
    ἐκλογιστίαν τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπὶ πᾶσαν τὴν διοίκησιν.
22 Καὶ ἠξίωσεν Ἀχιάχαρος περὶ ἐμοῦ, καὶ ἦλθεν εἰς Νινευῆ. Ἀ-
    χιάχαρος δὲ ἦν ὁ οἰνοχόος, καὶ ἐπὶ τοῦ δακτυλίου, καὶ διοικη-
    τής, καὶ ἐκλογιστής, καὶ κατέστησεν αὐτὸν ὁ Σαχερδονόσος ἐκ
    δευτέρας· ἦν δὲ ἐξάδελφός μου.

ΚΕΦ. Βʹ. ΙΙ.

1 ΟΤΕ δὲ κατῆλθον εἰς τὸν οἶκόν μου, καὶ ἀπεδόθη μοι Ἄννα
    ἡ γυνή μου, καὶ Τωβίας ὁ υἱός μου, ἐν τῇ πεντηκοστῇ τῇ ἑορ-
    τῇ, ἣ ἐστιν ἁγία ἑπτὰ ἑβδομάδων, ἐγενήθη ἄριστον καλόν μοι,
2 καὶ ἀνέπεσα τοῦ φαγεῖν. Καὶ ἐθεασάμην ζῷα πολλὰ, καὶ εἶπα

**CHAPTER I.**

11 of the nations, but I preserved my soul, that I might not eat [thereof];
12 because I remembered God with all my soul.
13 And the Most High bestowed grace and favor before Enemessar, and I was his purveyor,
14 and I journeyed into Media, and entrusted unto Gabael, the brother of Gabrias, in Rages of Media, ten talents of silver.
15 And when Enemessar died, Sennacherib his son reigned in his stead; and his ways became unstable,
16 and no longer was I able to journey into Media. Yet in the days of Enemessar, I did many alms unto
17 my brethren. My bread I gave unto the hungry, and my garments unto the naked; and if any of my kindred I beheld dead and cast upon the wall in Nineveh, him did I bury.
18 And if any Sennacherib the king slew, when he came fleeing from Judea, I buried them by stealth; for many did he slay in his wrath, and the bodies were sought by the king,
19 but were not found. Then one of the Ninevites went forth and showed the king concerning me, that I did bury them; and I was hid. And knowing that I was sought unto death, I fled, being afraid.
20 And all my possessions were plundered, and there was nothing left unto me, save Anna my wife and Tobiah
21 my son. And not fifty days passed, until his two sons slew him; and they fled into the mountains of Ararat, and Sarchedon, his son, reigned in his stead. And he appointed Achiachar, the son of Anael, my brother's son, over all the accounting of his kingdom, and over all the administration.
22 And Achiachar pleaded for me, and I came into Nineveh. Now Achiachar was the cupbearer, and in charge of the signet ring, and an administrator, and an accountant; and Sarchedonosus appointed him a second time: for he was my cousin.

**CHAPTER II.**

1 Now when I returned unto my house, and Anna my wife and Tobiah my son were restored unto me, it came to pass that on the feast of Pentecost, which is the holy [feast] of seven weeks, a good dinner was prepared for me,
2 and I sat down to eat. And I beheld many living creatures, and I said
