**1688 ΜΑΚΚΑΒΑΙΩΝ Β΄. ΚΕΦ. Θ΄.**
ναζεῖν, καὶ ζῶντος ἐν ὀδύναις καὶ ἀλγηδόσι τὰς σάρκας αὐτοῦ
διαπίπτειν, ὑπὸ δὲ τῆς ὀσμῆς αὐτοῦ πᾶν τὸ στρατόπεδον βαρύνε-
**10** σθαι τῇ σαπρίᾳ. Καὶ τὸν μικρῷ πρότερον τῶν οὐρανίων ἄστρων
ἀπτεσθαι δοκοῦντα, παρακομίζειν οὐδεὶς ἐδύνατο, διὰ τὸ τῆς ὀσμῆς
**11** ἀφόρητον βάρος. Ἐνταῦθα οὖν ἤρξατο τὸ πολὺ τῆς ὑπερηφανίας
λήγειν τεθραυσμένος, καὶ εἰς ἐπίγνωσιν ἔρχεσθαι θείᾳ μάστιγι
**12** κατὰ στιγμὴν ἐπιτεινόμενος ταῖς ἀλγηδόσι. Καὶ μηδὲ τῆς ὀσμῆς
αὐτοῦ ἀνέχεσθαι δυνάμενος, ταῦτ᾽ ἔφη· δίκαιον ὑποτάσσεσθαι τῷ
Θεῷ, καὶ μὴ θνητὸν ὄντα ἰσόθεα φρονεῖν ὑπερηφάνως.
**13** Ηὔχετο δὲ ὁ μικρὸς πρὸς τὸν οὐκέτι αὐτὸν ἐλεήσοντα δεσπότην,
**14** οὕτως λέγων· Τὴν μὲν ἁγίαν πόλιν, ἣν σπεύδων παρεγένετο ἰσό-
πεδον ποιῆσαι καὶ πολυάνδριον οἰκοδομῆσαι, ἐλευθέραν ἀναδεῖξαι·
**15** Τοὺς δὲ Ἰουδαίους, οὓς διεγνώκει μηδὲ ταφῆς ἀξιῶσαι, οἰωνο-
βρώτους δὲ σὺν τοῖς νηπίοις ἐκρίψειν θηρίοις, πάντας αὐτοὺς
**16** ἴσους Ἀθηναίοις ποιήσειν. Ὃν δὲ πρότερον ἐσκύλευσεν ἅγιον νεὼν
καλλίστοις ἀναθήμασι κοσμήσειν, καὶ τὰ ἱερὰ σκεύη πολυπλάσια
**17** πάντα ἀποδώσειν, τὰς δὲ ἐπιβαλλούσας πρὸς τὰς θυσίας συντελέσειν,
καὶ Ἰουδαῖον ἔσεσθαι, καὶ πάντα τόπον οἰκητὸν ἐπελεύσεσθαι
**18** καταγγέλλοντα τὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ κράτος. Οὐδαμῶς δὲ ληγόντων τῶν
πόνων, ἐπελήλυθει γὰρ ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν δικαία ἡ τοῦ Θεοῦ κρίσις, τὰ
**19** κατ᾿ αὐτὸν ἀπελπίσας, ἔγραφε πρὸς τοὺς Ἰουδαίους τὴν ὑπογε-
γραμμένην ἐπιστολήν, ἔχουσαν ἱκετηρίας τάξιν, περιέχουσαν δὲ
**20** οὕτως. Τοῖς χρηστοῖς Ἰουδαίοις τοῖς πολίταις πολλὰ χαίρειν
καὶ ὑγιαίνειν καὶ εὖ πράττειν βασιλεὺς Ἀντίοχος καὶ στρατηγός.
**21** Εἰ ἐῤῥῶσθε, καὶ τὰ τέκνα καὶ τὰ ἴδια κατὰ γνώμην ἐστὶν ὑμῖν,
εὔχομαι μὲν τῷ Θεῷ τὴν μεγίστην χάριν, εἰς οὐρανὸν τὴν ἐλπί-
δα ἔχων. Κἀγὼ δὲ ἀσθενῶς διεκείμην, ὑμῶν τὴν τιμὴν καὶ τὴν
**22** εὔνοιαν ἂν ἐμνημόνευον φιλοστόργως· ἐπαναγαγὼν ἐκ τῶν περὶ
τὴν Περσίδα τόπων, καὶ περιπεσὼν ἀσθενείᾳ δυσχέρειαν ἐχούσῃ,
**23** ἀναγκαῖον ἡγησάμην φροντίσαι τῆς κοινῆς πάντων ὑμῶν ἀσφα-
λείας· Οὐκ ἀπογινώσκων τὰ κατ᾿ ἐμαυτόν, ἀλλὰ ἔχων πολλὴν
**24** ἐλπίδα ἐκφεύξεσθαι τὴν ἀσθένειαν. Θεωρῶν δὲ ὅτι καὶ ὁ πατὴρ,
καθ᾿ οὓς καιροὺς εἰς τοὺς ἄνω τόπους ἐστρατοπέδευσεν, ἀνέδειξε
τὸν διαδεξόμενον. Ὅπως ἐάν τι παράδοξον ἀποβαίνῃ, καὶ προσ-
αγγελθῇ τι δυσχερές, εἰδότες οἱ κατὰ τὴν χώραν, ᾧ καταλελειπται

**9** ...did boil forth, and whilst he yet lived, his very flesh did fall away amid pains and agonies, and by the stench thereof was all the camp oppressed by reason of the putrefaction. **10** And him who, a little while afore, deemed he could touch the stars of heaven, none was able to transport, because of the insufferable weight of the stench.

**11** At this point, therefore, did the greater part of his haughtiness begin to cease, being broken, and he came to [a] recognition by the divine scourge, **12** as with every moment the pains intensified. And not being able even to endure his own stench, he spake these words: "It is righteous to be subject unto God, and for a mortal man not to deem [himself] equal to God, nor to be proudly minded."

**13** And the wretch prayed unto the Master, who would no longer have mercy upon him, **14** saying thus: "The holy city, which I hastened to make level with the ground and to build into a burying-place, will I now proclaim free; **15** and the Jews, whom I had resolved not to deem worthy even of burial, but to cast out for wild beasts to devour, together with their infants, all these will I make **16** equal unto the Athenians. And the holy temple, which aforetime I plundered, will I adorn with most beautiful offerings, and all the sacred vessels I will restore manifold; **17** and the customary contributions for the sacrifices will I furnish, and I myself will become a Jew, and will visit every inhabited place **18** proclaiming the power of God."

Yet did his pains by no means cease; for the righteous judgment of God had come upon him, and despairing of his own state, **19** he wrote unto the Jews the letter here subjoined, having the form of a supplication, and containing these words:

**20** "King Antiochus and [his] General, unto the good citizen Jews, [send] much greeting and health and welfare. **21** If ye be in good health, and your children and your private affairs be according to your mind, I indeed pray to God for the greatest grace, having my hope in heaven. But as for me, I was weakly disposed, and I would affectionately remember your honor and your **22** goodwill. Having returned from the regions of Persia, and having fallen into a troublesome sickness, **23** I deemed it necessary to care for the common safety of all of you. Not despairing of mine own [condition], but having much **24** hope to escape the sickness. And observing that my father also, in the times when he encamped in the upper regions, appointed his successor, so that if anything unexpected should come to pass, and any troublesome thing should be reported, those in the country, knowing to whom [the affairs] are committed,
