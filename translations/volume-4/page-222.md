ΚΕΦ. Β΄. ΒΑΡΟΥΧ 1753
ἡμᾶς, ἄνθρωπον σάρκας υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἄνθρωπον σάρκας θυγα- 3
τρὸς αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτοὺς ὑποχειρίους πάσαις ταῖς βασι- 4
λείαις ταῖς κύκλῳ ἡμῶν, εἰς ὀνειδισμὸν, καὶ εἰς ἄβατον ἐν πά-
σι τοῖς λαοῖς τοῖς κύκλῳ ἡμῶν, οὗ διέσπειρεν αὐτοὺς Κύριος ἐκεῖ.
Καὶ ἐγεννήθησαν ὑποκάτω καὶ οὐκ ἐπάνω, ὅτι ἡμάρτομεν τῷ Κυ- 5
ρίῳ Θεῷ ἡμῶν, πρὸς τὸ μὴ ἀκούειν τῆς φωνῆς αὐτοῦ. Τῷ Κυρίῳ 6
Θεῷ ἡμῶν ἡ δικαιοσύνη, ἡμῖν δὲ καὶ τοῖς πατρράσιν ἡμῶν ἡ αἰσχύνη
τῶν προσώπων, ὡς ἡ ἡμέρα αὕτη. Ἄ ἐλάλησε Κύριος ἐφ᾽ ἡμᾶς, 7
πάντα τὰ κακὰ ταῦτα (ἃ) ἦλθεν ἐφ᾽ ἡμᾶς, καὶ οὐκ ἐδεήθημεν τοῦ 8
προσώπου Κυρίου, τοῦ ἀποστρέψαι ἕκαστον ἀπὸ τῶν νεμημάτων
τῆς καρδίας αὐτοῦ τῆς πονηρᾶς. Καὶ ἐγρηγόρησε Κύριος ἐπὶ τοῖς 9
κακοῖς, καὶ ἐπήγαγε Κύριος, ἐφ᾽ ἡμᾶς, ὅτι δίκαιος Κύριος ἐπὶ
πάντα τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ, ἃ ἐνετείλατο ἡμῖν. Καὶ οὐκ ἠκούσα- 10
μεν τῆς φωνῆς αὐτοῦ, πορεύεσθαι τοῖς προστάγμασι Κυρίου,
οἷς ἔδωκε κατὰ πρόσωπον ἡμῶν. Καὶ νῦν, Κύριε ὁ Θεὸς 11
Ἰσραήλ, ὁ ἐξαγαγὼν τὸν λαόν σου ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, ἐν χειρὶ
κραταιᾷ, καὶ ἐν σημείοις, καὶ ἐν τέρασι, καὶ ἐν δυνάμει μεγάλῃ,
καὶ ἐν βραχίονι ὑψηλῷ, καὶ ἐποίησας σεαυτῷ ὄνομα, ὡς ἡ ἡμέρα
αὕτη, ἡμάρτομεν, ἠσεβήσαμεν, ἠδικήσαμεν, Κύριε ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν 12
ἐπὶ πᾶσι τοῖς δικαιώμασί σου. Ἀποστραφήτω δὲ ὁ θυμός σου ἀφ᾽ 13
ἡμῶν, ὅτι κατελείφθημεν ὀλίγοι ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν, οὗ διέσπειρας
ἡμᾶς ἐκεῖ. Εἰσάκουσον, Κύριε, τῆς προσευχῆς ἡμῶν, καὶ τῆς δεή- 14
σεως ἡμῶν, καὶ ἔξελοῦ ἡμᾶς ἕνεκεν τοῦ ὀνόματός σου, καὶ δὸς
ἡμῖν χάριν κατὰ πρόσωπον τῶν ἀποικισάντων ἡμᾶς, ἵνα γνω- 15
πάσῃ ἡ γῆ, ὅτι σὺ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν, ἔτι τὸ ὄνομά σου ἐπικέ-
κληται ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸ γένος αὐτοῦ. Κύριε, κάτιδε ἐκ τοῦ 16
οἴκου τοῦ ἁγίου σου, καὶ ἐννόησον εἰς ἡμᾶς, κλῖνον, Κύριε, τὸ οὖς
σου, καὶ εἰσάκουσον. Καὶ ἄνοιξον, Κύριε, τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς σου, 17
καὶ ἴδε ὅτι οὐχ οἱ τεθνεῶτες ἐν τῷ ᾅδῃ, ὧν ἐλήφθη τὸ πνεῦμα αὐ-
τῶν ἀπὸ τῶν σπλάγχνων αὐτῶν, δώσουσι δόξαν καὶ δικαίωμα τῷ
Κυρίῳ, ἀλλ᾽ ἡ ψυχὴ ἡ λυπουμένη ἔτι τὸ μέγεθος, ὃ βαδίζει κό- 18
πτον καὶ ἀσθενοῦν, καὶ οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ οἱ ἐκλείποντες, καὶ ἡ ψυχὴ
ἡ πεινῶσα δώσουσι δόξαν σοι, καὶ δικαιοσύνην Κύριε. Ὅτι οὐκ 19
ἐπὶ τὰ δικαιώματα τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν, καὶ τῶν βασιλέων ἡμῶν
ἡμεῖς καταβάλλομεν τὸν ἔλεον ἡμῶν κατὰ πρόσωπόν σου, Κύριε,
ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν, ὅτι ἐνήκας τὸν θυμόν σου καὶ τὴν ὀργήν σου ἐφ᾽ ἡ- 20

**CHAPTER II.**

**3** ...us, a man the flesh of his son, and a man the flesh of his daughter.
**4** And He gave them into subjection unto all the kingdoms that were round about us, for a reproach, and for a desolation amongst all the peoples that were round about us, where the Lord had scattered them there.
**5** And they were made beneath, and not above, because we have sinned against the Lord our God, in not hearkening unto His voice.
**6** To the Lord our God belongeth righteousness, but unto us and unto our fathers the shame of faces, as at this day.
**7** Lo, the Lord spake concerning us, all these evils [which] came upon us,
**8** and we entreated not the face of the Lord, that each one should turn away from the devices of his evil heart.
**9** And the Lord watched over the evils, and the Lord brought [them] upon us; for the Lord is righteous in all His works, which He commanded us.
**10** And we hearkened not unto His voice, to walk in the commandments of the Lord, which He gave us before our face.
**11** And now, O Lord, the God of Israel, who didst bring forth Thy people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with signs, and with wonders, and with great power, and with a high arm, and didst make Thyself a name, as at this day,
**12** we have sinned, we have done wickedly, we have dealt unjustly, O Lord our God, in all Thy righteous ordinances.
**13** But let Thy wrath be turned away from us, for we are left but a few among the nations, where Thou hast scattered us there.
**14** Hearken, O Lord, unto our prayer, and unto our supplication, and deliver us for Thy Name's sake, and give
**15** us favour in the sight of them that have carried us away captive, that the earth may know that Thou art the Lord our God, and that Thy Name is still called upon Israel, and upon his race.
**16** O Lord, look down from Thy holy house, and consider us; incline, O Lord, Thine ear, and hearken.
**17** And open, O Lord, Thine eyes, and see; for not the dead in Hades, from whom their spirit hath been taken from their inward parts, shall give glory and righteousness unto the Lord,
**18** but the soul that grieveth, which still grieveth greatly, which walketh in weariness and weakness, and the eyes that fail, and the soul
**19** that hungereth shall give glory unto Thee, and righteousness, O Lord. For not upon the righteousness of our fathers and of our kings do we cast our plea for mercy before Thy face, O Lord our God,
**20** for Thou hast brought Thy wrath and Thine anger upon us, as Thou spakest by the hand of Thy servants the prophets,
