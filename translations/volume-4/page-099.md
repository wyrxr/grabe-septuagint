**48** καὶ τὰ ὁρμήματα τῶν δυνάμεων, καὶ ἐξέκλιναν ἀπ᾽ αὐτῶν. Καὶ
ἐκ τῆς παρεμβολῆς τοῦ βασιλέως ἀνέβαινον εἰς συνάντησιν αὐ-
τὸν εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ· καὶ παρενέβαλεν ὁ βασιλεὺς εἰς τὴν Ἰου-
**49** δαίαν καὶ εἰς τὸ ὄρος Σιών. Καὶ ἐποίησεν εἰρήνην μετὰ τῶν ἐκ
Βαιθσούρων· καὶ ἐξῆλθον ἐκ τῆς πόλεως, ὅτι οὐκ ἦν αὐτοῖς ἐκεῖ
διατροφὴ τοῦ συγκεκλεῖσθαι ἐν αὐτῇ, ὅτι σάββατον ἦν τῇ γῇ.
**50** Καὶ κατελάβετο ὁ βασιλεὺς τὴν Βαιθσούραν, καὶ ἀπέταξεν ἐκεῖ
φρουρὰν τηρεῖν αὐτήν.
**51** Καὶ παρενέβαλεν ἐπὶ τὸ ἁγίασμα ἡμέρας πολλάς, καὶ ἔστησεν
ἐκεῖ βελοστάσεις καὶ μηχανὰς καὶ πυρόβολα καὶ λιθόβολα καὶ
σκορπίδια εἰς τὸ βάλλεσθαι βέλη καὶ σφενδόνας.
**52** Καὶ ἐποίησαν καὶ αὐτοὶ μηχανὰς πρὸς τὰς μηχανὰς αὐτῶν, καὶ
ἐπολέμησαν ἡμέρας πολλάς.
**53** Βρώματα δὲ οὐκ ἦν ἐν τοῖς ἀγγείοις, διὰ τὸ ἕβδομον ἔτος εἶναι,
καὶ οἱ ἀνασωζόμενοι εἰς τὴν Ἰουδαίαν ἀπὸ τῶν ἐθνῶν κατέφαγον
τὸ ὑπόλειμμα τῆς παραθέσεως.
**54** Καὶ ὑπελείφθησαν ἐν τοῖς ἁγίοις ἄνδρες ὀλίγοι, ὅτι κατεκράτησεν
αὐτῶν ὁ λιμός· καὶ ἐσκορπίσθησαν ἕκαστος εἰς τὸν τόπον αὐτοῦ.
**55** Καὶ ἤκουσε Λυσίας, ὅτι Φίλιππος ὃν κατέστησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἀντίοχος
ἔτι ζῶντος αὐτοῦ ἐθρέψαι Ἀντίοχον τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸ βασιλεῦσαι
αὐτόν,
**56** ἀπέτρεψεν ἀπὸ τῆς Περσίδος καὶ Μηδείας, καὶ αἱ δυνάμεις αἱ
πορευθεῖσαι τοῦ βασιλέως μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὅτι ζητεῖ παραλαβεῖν
τὰ πράγματα.
**57** Καὶ κατέσπευδον καὶ ἐνεπύσσοντο τοῦ ἀπελθεῖν, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς
τὸν βασιλέα καὶ τοὺς ἡγεμόνας τῆς δυνάμεως καὶ τοὺς ἄνδρας·
ἐκλείπομεν καθ᾽ ἡμέραν, καὶ ἡ τροφὴ ἡμῖν ὀλίγη, καὶ ὁ τόπος,
οὗ παρεμβάλλομεν, ἐστὶν ὀχυρός, καὶ ἐπίκειται ἡμῖν τὰ τῆς βασιλείας.
**58** Νῦν οὖν δῶμεν δεξιὰν τοῖς ἀνθρώποις τούτοις, καὶ ποιήσωμεν
μετ᾽ αὐτῶν εἰρήνην, καὶ μετὰ παντὸς ἔθνους αὐτῶν·
**59** καὶ στήσωμεν αὐτοῖς τοῦ πορεύεσθαι τοῖς νομίμοις αὐτῶν, ὡς
τοπρότερον· χάριν γὰρ τῶν νομίμων αὐτῶν, ὧν διεσκεδάσαμεν,
ὠργίσθησαν καὶ ἐποίησαν ταῦτα πάντα.
**60** Καὶ ἤρεσεν ὁ λόγος ἐναντίον τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ τῶν ἀρχόντων,
καὶ ἀπέστειλε πρὸς αὐτοὺς εἰρηνεῦσαι, καὶ ἀπεδέξαντο.
**61** Καὶ ὤμοσεν αὐτοῖς ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες· ἐπὶ τούτοις
ἐξῆλθον ἐκ τοῦ ὀχυρώματος.
**62** Καὶ εἰσῆλθεν ὁ βασιλεὺς εἰς τὸ ὄρος Σιών, καὶ ἴδε τὸ ὀχύρωμα
τοῦ τόπου· καὶ ἠθέτησε τὸν ὁρκισμὸν ὃν ὤμοσε,
**63** καὶ ἐνετείλατο καὶ καθεῖλε τὸ τεῖχος κυκλόθεν.

### Chapter 6

**48** and the impetuous charges of the forces, and they turned away from them. And from the king's camp they ascended to meet him in Jerusalem; and the king encamped in Judea and upon Mount Zion.
**49** And he made peace with those of Beth-zur; and they came forth from the city, because there was no sustenance there for them to be shut up therein, for it was the sabbath of the land.
**50** And the king took possession of Beth-zur, and set there a garrison to keep it.
**51** And he encamped against the sanctuary many days, and there he set up ballistas and engines [of war], and fire-catapults and stone-throwers, and scorpions, for the casting forth of arrows and sling-stones.
**52** And they also made engines [of war] against their engines, and fought many days.
**53** But there was no food in their store-chambers, because it was the seventh year, and those who had been preserved and returned to Judea from the Gentiles had consumed the remnant of the provisions.
**54** And there remained in the holy places but a few men, for the famine had prevailed against them; and they were scattered, each man to his own place.
**55** And Lysias heard that Philip, whom King Antiochus, while yet he lived, had appointed to bring up Antiochus his son, that he might reign,
**56** had returned from Persia and Media, with the forces of the king that had gone forth with him, and that he sought to take the reins of government.
**57** And they made haste and were greatly urgent to depart, and he spake unto the king and unto the captains of the host and unto the men: 'We are diminished daily, and our food is little, and the place where we do encamp is strong, and the affairs of the kingdom press hard upon us.
**58** Now therefore let us give the right hand of fellowship to these men, and let us make peace with them, and with all their nation;
**59** and let us establish for them that they may walk in their own laws, as in times past; for because of their laws, which we have scattered [abroad], they have been wroth and have done all these things.'
**60** And the saying pleased the king and the princes, and he sent unto them to make peace, and they accepted it.
**61** And the king and the princes sware unto them; whereupon they came forth out of the stronghold.
**62** And the king entered into Mount Zion, and saw the strength of the place; and he broke the oath which he had sworn,
**63** and commanded and pulled down the wall round about.
