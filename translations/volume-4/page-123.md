αὐτοῦ, καὶ παρεκάλεσαν ἑαυτούς, καὶ ἐπορεύοντο συνεστραμμένοι
**51** ἕτοιμοι εἰς πόλεμον. Καὶ ἴδον οἱ διώκοντες ὅτι περὶ ψυχῆς
**52** αὐτοῖς ἐστί· καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν. Καὶ ἦλθον πάντες μετ᾿ εἰρήνης εἰς
    γῆν Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐπένθησαν τὸν Ἰωνάθαν καὶ τοὺς μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ
**53** ἐφοβήθησαν σφόδρα, καὶ ἐπένθησαν πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ πένθος μέγα. Καὶ
    ἐζήτησαν πάντα τὰ ἔθνη τὰ κύκλῳ αὐτῶν ἐκτρῖψαι αὐτούς· εἶπαν
    γάρ· οὐκ ἔχουσιν ἄνδρα ἄρχοντα καὶ βοηθοῦντα· νῦν οὖν πολε-
    μήσωμεν αὐτούς, καὶ ἐξάρωμεν ἐξ ἀνθρώπων τὸ μνημόσυνον
    αὐτῶν.

**ΚΕΦ. ΙΓ΄. ΧΙΙΙ.**

**1** Καὶ ἤκουσε Σίμων, ὅτι συνήγαγε Τρύφων δύναμιν πολλὴν τοῦ
**2** ἐλθεῖν εἰς γῆν Ἰούδα τοῦ ἐκτρῖψαι αὐτήν. Καὶ εἶδε τὸν λαὸν
    ὅτι ἐστὶν ἔντρομος καὶ ἔκφοβος, καὶ ἀνέβη εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ
**3** ἤθροισε τὸν λαόν, καὶ παρεκάλεσεν αὐτούς, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς·
    αὐτοὶ οἴδατε ὅσα ἐγὼ καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοί μου καὶ ὁ οἶκος τοῦ πα-
    τρός μου ἐποιήσαμεν περὶ τῶν νόμων καὶ τῶν ἁγίων, καὶ τοὺς
**4** πολέμους καὶ τὰς στενοχωρίας ἃς εἴδομεν. Τούτου χάριν ἀπώ-
    λοντο οἱ ἀδελφοί μου πάντες χάριν τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ κατελείφθην
**5** ἐγὼ μόνος. Καὶ νῦν· μή μοι γένοιτο φείσασθαί μου τῆς ψυ-
    χῆς ἐν παντὶ καιρῷ θλίψεως· οὐ γὰρ εἰμι κρείσσων τῶν ἀδελ-
**6** φῶν μου. Πλὴν ἐκδικήσω περὶ τοῦ ἔθνους μου καὶ περὶ τῶν
    ἁγίων καὶ περὶ τῶν γυναικῶν καὶ τῶν τέκνων ἡμῶν, ὅτι συνήχ-
**7** θησαν πάντα τὰ ἔθνη ἐκτρῖψαι ἡμᾶς ἔχθρας χάριν. Καὶ ἀνε-
    ζωπύρησε τὸ πνεῦμα τοῦ λαοῦ ἅμα τῷ ἀκοῦσαι τῶν λόγων τού-
**8** των· καὶ ἀπεκρίθησαν φωνῇ μεγάλῃ, λέγοντες· σὺ εἶ ἡμῶν
**9** ἡγούμενος ἀντὶ Ἰούδου καὶ Ἰωνάθου τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου. Πολέ-
    μησον τὸν πόλεμον ἡμῶν, καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐὰν εἴπῃς ἡμῖν ποιήσο-
**10** μεν. Καὶ συνήγαγε πάντας τοὺς ἄνδρας τοὺς πολεμιστάς, καὶ
    ἐτάχυνε τοῦ τελέσαι τὰ τείχη Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ὠχύρωσεν αὐ-
**11** τὴν κυκλόθεν. Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ἰωνάθαν τὸν τοῦ Ἀβεσσαλώμου
    καὶ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ δύναμιν ἱκανὴν εἰς Ἰόππην, καὶ ἐξέβαλε τοὺς ἐν
**12** αὐτῇ ὄντας, καὶ ἔμεινεν ἐκεῖ ἐν αὐτῇ. Καὶ ἀπῆρε Τρύφων ἀπὸ
    Πτολεμαΐδος μετὰ δυνάμεως πολλῆς εἰσελθεῖν εἰς γῆν Ἰούδα, καὶ
**13** Ἰωνάθαν μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἐν φυλακῇ. Σίμων δὲ παρενέβαλεν ἐν Ἀδί-
**14** δοις κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ πεδίου. Καὶ ἐπέγνω Τρύφων ὅτι ἀνέστῃ

**13:4** For this cause my brethren all perished for Israel's sake; and I alone was left.
**13:5** And now, far be it from me that I should spare my life in any time of affliction; for I am no better than my brethren.
