24 ἐξείλκυσαν ὑπερβάλλοντι καταπεπληγμένοι φόβῳ. Ἐν χρόνῳ δὲ ὕστερον
25 ἀναλεξάμενος αὐτόν, οὐδαμῶς εἰς μετάμελον ἦλθεν ἐπιτιμηθείς, μετὰ ἀπειλῆς δὲ πικρᾶς θέμενος ἀνέλυσεν. Διακομισθεὶς
δὲ εἰς τὴν Αἴγυπτον, καὶ τὰ τῆς κακίας ἐπαύξων, διά τε τῶν
προαποδεδειγμένων συμποτῶν καὶ ἑταίρων τοῦ παντὸς δικαίου
26 κεχωρισμένων, οὐ μόνον ταῖς ἀναριθμήτοις ἀσελγείαις διηρκέσθη,
ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐπὶ τοσοῦτον θράσους προσῆλθεν, ὥστε δυσφημίας ἐν
τοῖς τόποις συνίστασθαι, καὶ πολλοὺς τῶν φίλων ἀτενίζοντας
εἰς τὴν τοῦ βασιλέως πρόθεσιν καὶ αὐτοὺς ἔπεσθαι τῇ ἐκείνου
27 θελήσει. Προέθετο δὲ δημοσίᾳ κατὰ τοῦ ἔθνους διαδοῦναι ψόγον·
καὶ ἐπὶ τοῦ κατὰ τὴν αὐλὴν πύργου στήλην ἀναστήσας,
28 ἐκόλαψε γραφήν· μηδένα τῶν μὴ θυόντων εἰς τὰ ἱερὰ αὐτῶν
εἰσιέναι, πάντας δὲ τοὺς Ἰουδαίους εἰς λαογραφίαν καὶ οἰκετικὴν
διάθεσιν ἀχθῆναι, τοὺς δὲ ἀντιλέγοντας βίᾳ φερομένους τοῦ ζῆν
29 μεταστῆσαι. Τούτους τε ἀπογραφομένους χαράσσεσθαι, καὶ διὰ
πυρὸς εἰς τὸ σῶμα πρατήρῳ Διονύσῳ Κισσοφύλλῳ, οὓς καὶ
30 προκαταχωρίσαι εἰς τὴν προσυνεσταλμένην αὐθεντίαν. Ἵνα δὲ
μὴ τοῖς πᾶσιν ἀπεχθόμενος φαίνηται, ὑπέγραψεν· ἐὰν δέ τινες
ἐξ αὐτῶν προαιρῶνται ἐν τοῖς κατὰ τελετὰς μεμυημένοις ἀνα-
31 στρέφεσθαι, τούτους ἰσοπολίτας Ἀλεξανδρεῦσιν εἶναι. Ἔνιοι μὲν
οὖν ἐπὶ πόλεως τὰς τῆς πόλεως εὐσεβείας ἐπιβάθρας στυγοῦντες,
εὐχερῶς ἑαυτοὺς ἐδίδοσαν, ὡς μεγάλης τινὸς κοινωνήσοντες
32 εὐκλείας ἀπὸ τῆς ἐσομένης τῷ βασιλεῖ συναναστροφῆς. Οἱ δὲ
πλεῖστοι γενναίᾳ ψυχῇ ἐνίσχυσαν, καὶ οὐ διέστησαν τῆς εὐσεβείας·
τά τε χρήματα περὶ τοῦ ζῆν ἀντικαταλλασσόμενοι ἀδεῶς
33 ἐπειρῶντο ἑαυτοὺς ἐξάσθαι ἐκ τῶν ἀπογραφῶν. Εὐέλπιδες δὲ
καθεστήκεισαν ἀντιλήψεως τεύξεσθαι, καὶ τοὺς ἀποχωροῦντας
ἐξ αὐτῶν ἐβδελύσσοντο, καὶ ὡς πολεμίους τοῦ ἔθνους ἔκρινον, καὶ
τῆς κοινῆς συναναστροφῆς καὶ εὐχρηστίας ἐστέρουν.

**Chapter 3**

1 ΚΑΙ μεταλαμβάνων ὁ δυσσεβής, ἐπὶ τοσοῦτον ἐξεχόλησεν,
ὥστε οὐ μόνον τοῖς κατὰ Ἀλεξάνδρειαν διοργίζεσθαι, ἀλλὰ καὶ
τοῖς ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ βαρυτέρως ἐναντιοῦσθαι, καὶ προστάξαι σπεύδοντας
συναγαγεῖν πάντας ἐπιτοκουθὶ, καὶ χειρίστῳ μέρει τοῦ

**III Maccabees, Chapter 2**

**24** did drag him out, overcome by an exceeding dread. And in time afterward,
**25** when he had recovered, he came not at all unto repentance, though he had been chastised, but having uttered a bitter threat, he departed. And being transported
unto Egypt, and magnifying the works of his malice, both by means of the boon companions and partners previously pointed out,
**26** who were separated from all righteousness, not only was he content with unnumbered wantonnesses, but also did he advance unto such a measure of audacity, that slanders were continually raised in all places [against them], and many of his friends, looking intently upon the king's purpose,
**27** did themselves follow his will. And he purposed publicly to spread calumny against the nation; and having set up a pillar upon the tower that was by the court,
**28** he did engrave a writing [thereupon]: "That no man of those who did not sacrifice unto their gods should enter their temples; and that all the Jews should be brought into a public registration and a condition of servitude; and that those who gainsaid [this decree], being forcibly led away, should be removed from life."
**29** And these, being registered, were to be branded by fire upon the body for Dionysius Kissophyllus, the vendor [of slaves]; whom he had also
**30** previously assigned unto the authority already established. But lest he should seem to be hated of all men, he did subscribe: "If any of them choose to associate among them that are initiated in the rites,
**31** these are to be fellow-citizens with the Alexandrians." Some, therefore, in the city, abhorring the foundations of their ancestral piety, did readily give themselves up, as though they should partake of some great
**32** glory by means of the association that was to be with the king. But the most part strengthened themselves with a noble soul, and did not depart from piety; and fearlessly exchanging their money for their lives,
**33** they attempted to remove themselves from the registrations. And they stood in good hope that they should obtain succor; and they abhorred those who withdrew from them, and judged them as enemies of the nation, and deprived them of common fellowship and good repute.

**Chapter 3**

**1** And the impious one, taking these [things] to heart, was so greatly inflamed with wrath, that he was not only wroth with those in Alexandria, but also did he more grievously oppose those in the country, and did command [his men] speedily to gather all, summarily, and to remove them from life by the most wretched means.
