ρον τὸν ἐνενηκονταετῆ μεταβῆναι εἰς ἀλλοφυλισμὸν, καὶ αὐτοὶ 25
διὰ τὴν ἐμὴν ὑπόκρισιν καὶ διὰ τὸ μικρὸν καὶ ἀκρίαιτον ζῆν πλα-
νηθῶσι δι᾿ ἐμὲ, καὶ μῦσος καὶ κηλῖδα τοῦ γήρους κατακτήσωμαι.
Εἰ γὰρ καὶ ἐπὶ τοῦ παρόντος ἐξελοῦμαι τὴν ἐξ ἀνθρώπων τιμω- 26
ρίαν, ἀλλὰ τὰς τοῦ παντοκράτορος χεῖρας οὔτε ζῶν οὔτε ἀποθα-
νὼν ἐκφεύξομαι. Διόπερ ἀνδρείως μὲν νῦν διαλλάξας τὸν βίον τοῦ 27
μὲν γήρως ἄξιος φανήσομαι, τοῖς δὲ νέοις ὑπόδειγμα γενναῖον κα- 28
ταλελοιπὼς εἰς τὸ προθύμως καὶ γενναίως ὑπὲρ τῶν σεμνῶν καὶ
ἁγίων νόμων ἀπευθανατίζειν· τοσαῦτα δὲ εἰπὼν ἐπὶ τὸ τύμπανον
εὐθέως ἦλθε· τῶν δὲ ἀνόντων τὴν μικρῷ πρότερον εὐμένειαν πρὸς 29
αὐτὸν εἰς δυσμένειαν μεταβαλόντων διὰ τῶν προειρημένων λό-
γων, οὓς αὐτοὶ ὑπελάμβανον ἀπόνοιαν εἶναι. Μέλλων δὲ ταῖς 30
πληγαῖς τελευτᾶν, ἀναστενάξας εἶπε· Τῷ κυρίῳ τῷ τὴν ἀγίαν
γνῶσιν ἔχοντι φανερόν ἐστιν, ὅτι δυνάμενος ἀπολυθῆναι τοῦ θα-
νάτου σκληρὰς ὑποφέρω κατὰ τὸ σῶμα ἀλγηδόνας μαστιγούμενος,
κατὰ ψυχὴν δὲ ἡδέως διὰ τὸν αὐτοῦ φόβον ταῦτα πάσχω. Καὶ 31
οὗτος οὖν τοῦτον τὸν τρόπον μετηλλάξεν, οὐ μόνον τοῖς νέοις,
ἀλλὰ καὶ τοῖς πλείστοις τοῦ ἔθνους τὸν ἑαυτοῦ θάνατον ὑπό-
δειγμα γενναιότητος καὶ μνημόσυνον ἀρετῆς καταλιπών.

ΣΥΝΕΒΗ δὲ καὶ ἑπτὰ ἀδελφοὺς μετὰ τῆς μητρὸς συλληφθέν- 1
τας ἀναγκάζεσθαι ὑπὸ τοῦ βασιλέως ἀπὸ τῶν ἀθεμίτων ὑείων κρεῶν
ἐφάπτεσθαι μάστιξι καὶ νευραῖς αἰκιζομένους. Εἷς δὲ αὐτῶν γε- 2
νόμενος πρόγορος εἶπε· τί μέλλεις ἐρω-τᾶν καὶ μανθάνειν παρ᾿ ἡ-
μῶν; ἕτοιμοι γὰρ ἀποθνήσκειν ἐσμὲν ἢ πατρῴους νόμους παραβαί-
νειν. Ἔκθυμος δὲ γενόμενος ὁ βασιλεὺς προσέταξε τήγανα καὶ 3
λέβητας ἐκπυροῦν. Τῶν δὲ παραχρῆμα ἐκπυρωθέντων, τὸν γε- 4
νόμενον αὐτῶν πρόγορον προσέταξε γλωσσοτομεῖν, καὶ περισκυ-
θίσαντας ἀκρωτηριάζειν, τῶν λοιπῶν ἀδελφῶν καὶ τῆς μητρὸς συ-
νορώντων. Ἄχρηστον δὲ αὐτὸν τοῖς ὅλως γενόμενον ἐκέλευσε τῇ 5
πυρᾷ προσάγειν ἔμπνουν καὶ τηγανίζειν· τῆς δὲ ἀτμίδος ἐφ᾿ ἵκα-

γενναίως τελευτᾶν, λέγοντες οὕτως. Ὁ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἐφορᾷ, καὶ 6
ταῖς ἀληθείαις ἐφ᾿ ἡμῖν παρακαλεῖται, καθάπερ διὰ τῆς κατὰ πρό-

#### CHAPTER VI.

**24** ...that Eleazar, who is ninety years of age, hath gone over unto foreign ways; **25** and that they themselves should be led astray by reason of my dissimulation, and for the sake of a short and worthless life, because of me, and thereby should I bring upon mine old age defilement and a blemish. **26** For though I should now escape the punishment of men, yet the hands of the Almighty shall I not escape, neither living nor dead. **27** Wherefore, having bravely changed my life now, I shall show myself worthy of mine old age, **28** and having left a noble example unto the young, to the end that they should willingly and courageously choose death for the sake of the venerable and holy laws."

And having spoken these words, he came straightway unto the instrument of torment. **29** But those who were senseless did change their goodwill, which they bore him but a little while before, into enmity, because of the words afore-spoken, which they themselves esteemed to be madness. **30** And being about to die by the stripes, he groaned and said, "It is manifest unto the Lord, who possesseth holy knowledge, that, being able to be delivered from death, I endure grievous pangs in my body, being scourged, yet in my soul do I willingly suffer these things for His fear." **31** And thus did this man depart [this life], leaving not only unto the young, but also unto the greater part of the nation, his own death as an example of noble courage, and a memorial of virtue.

#### CHAPTER VII.

**1** And it came to pass that seven brothers, with their mother, were seized, and were compelled by the king to partake of unlawful swine's flesh, being tormented with scourges and with thongs. **2** And one of them, who was their spokesman, said, "What dost thou intend to ask and to learn from us? For we are ready to die rather than to transgress the laws of our fathers."

**3** And the king, being exceedingly wroth, commanded that skillets and cauldrons should be heated. **4** And when these were straightway made hot, he commanded that the spokesman among them should have his tongue cut out, and that they should scalp him and mutilate his limbs, while the rest of the brethren and the mother looked on. **5** And when he was become altogether useless, he commanded that he should be brought to the fire while yet alive, and be fried; and while the vapor from the skillet was spread abroad for a considerable time, they exhorted one another, with their mother, to die nobly, saying thus: **6** "The Lord God doth behold, and in truth is He appeased concerning us, even as Moses declared through the song that bore witness against them face-to-
