ΚΕΦ. ΙΕ΄. ΙϚ΄.
σου, εὐποιήσας τὰ ἀγαθὰ μετὰ Ἰσραήλ· καὶ εὐδοκήσαι ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῖς
ὁ Θεός. Εὐλογημένη γίνου παρὰ τῷ παντοκράτορι Κυρίῳ εἰς τὸν
**11** αἰῶνα χρόνον. Καὶ εἶπε πᾶς ὁ λαός, Γένοιτο. Καὶ ἐλαφύρευσεν
ὁ λαὸς τὴν παρεμβολὴν ἐφ᾿ ἡμέρας τριάκοντα, καὶ ἔδωκαν τῇ Ἰουδίθ
τὴν σκηνὴν Ὁλοφέρνου, καὶ πάντα τὰ ἀργυρώματα, καὶ τὰς
κλίνας, καὶ τὰ ἕλκεια, καὶ πάντα τὰ κατασκευάσματα αὐτοῦ.
καὶ λαβοῦσα αὕτη ἐπέθηκεν ἐπὶ τὴν ἡμίονον αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐζεῦξε
**12** τὰς ἁμάξας αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐσώρευσεν αὐτὰ ἐπ᾿ αὐτῶν. Καὶ συνέδραμε
πᾶσα γυνὴ Ἰσραὴλ τοῦ ἰδεῖν αὐτήν, καὶ εὐλόγησαν αὐτήν,
καὶ ἐποίησαν αὐτῇ χορὸν ἐξ αὐτῶν· καὶ ἔλαβε θύρσους ἐν ταῖς
**13** χερσὶν αὐτῆς, καὶ ἔδωκε ταῖς γυναιξὶ ταῖς μετ᾿ αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐ-
στεφανώσατο τὴν ἐλαίαν αὐτὴ καὶ αἱ μετ᾿ αὐτῆς. καὶ προῆλθε
παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ ἐν χορείᾳ ἡγουμένη πασῶν τῶν γυναικῶν, καὶ
ἠκολούθει πᾶς ἀνὴρ Ἰσραήλ, ἐνωπλισμένοι μετὰ στεφάνων καὶ
**14** ὕμνων ἐν τῷ στόματι αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐξῆρχεν Ἰουδὶθ τὴν ἐξομολόγησιν
ταύτην ἐν παντὶ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ὑπεφώνει πᾶς ὁ λαὸς τὴν
αἴνεσιν ταύτην.

ΚΕΦ. ΙϚ΄. XVI.

**1** ΚΑΙ εἶπεν Ἰουδίθ, Ἐξάρχετε τῷ Θεῷ μου ἐν τυμπάνοις, ἄσατε
τῷ Κυρίῳ μου ἐν κυμβάλοις, ἐναρμόσασθε αὐτῷ ψαλμὸν καὶ
**2** ὕμνον, ὑψοῦτε καὶ ἐπικαλεῖσθε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ· ὅτι ὁ Θεὸς συν-
τρίβων πολέμους Κύριος, ὅτι εἰς παρεμβολὰς αὐτοῦ ἐν μέσῳ λαοῦ
**3** ἐξείλατό με ἐκ χειρὸς καταδιωκόντων με. Ἦλθεν Ἀσσούρ ἐξ
ὀρέων ἀπὸ βορρᾶ, ἦλθεν ἐν μυριάσι δυνάμεως αὐτοῦ, ὧν τὸ πλῆθος
αὐτῶν ἐνέφραζε χειμάῤῥους, καὶ ἡ ἵππος αὐτῶν ἐκάλυψε
**4** βουνούς. Εἶπεν ἐμπρήσειν τὰ ὅριά μου, καὶ τοὺς νεανίσκους μου
ἀνελεῖν ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ, καὶ τὰ θηλάζοντά μου θήσειν εἰς ἔδαφος, καὶ
τὰ νήπιά μου δώσειν εἰς προνομὴν, καὶ τὰς παρθένους μου σκυ-
λεῦσαι.
**5** Κύριος παντοκράτωρ ἠθέτησεν αὐτοὺς ἐν χειρὶ θηλείας.
**6** Οὐ γὰρ ὑπέπεσεν ὁ δυνατὸς αὐτῶν ὑπὸ νεανίσκων, οὐδὲ υἱοὶ Τιτάνων
ἐπάταξαν αὐτὸν, οὐδὲ ὑψηλοὶ γίγαντες ἐπέθεντο αὐτῷ,
ἀλλὰ Ἰουδίθ θυγάτηρ Μεραρὶ ἐν κάλλει προσώπου αὐτῆς πα-
ρέλυσεν αὐτόν.
**7** Ἐξεδύσατο γὰρ στολὴν χηρεύσεως αὐτῆς εἰς ὕψος
τῶν πονούντων ἐν Ἰσραήλ, ἠλείψατο τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτῆς ἐν μυ-
ρισμῷ,
**8** καὶ ἐδήσατο τὰς τρίχας αὐτῆς ἐν μίτρᾳ, καὶ ἔλαβε στο-

#### CHAPTER 15 (continued)

**10** ...[and may God approve them]. Blessed be thou of the Almighty Lord for evermore.”

**11** And all the people said, “Amen.” And the people plundered the camp for thirty days, and they gave unto Judith the tent of Holofernes, and all the silver[ware], and the couches, and the trappings, and all his furnishings. And she, having received these, laid them upon her mule, and yoked her wagons, and piled them upon them.

**12** And every woman of Israel ran together to see her, and they blessed her; and they made for her a dance from among themselves; and she took thyrsi in her hands,

**13** and gave [them] to the women that were with her, and she herself and those with her crowned themselves with olive [branches]. And she went forth before all the people in a dance, leading all the women, and every man of Israel followed, arrayed with crowns and

**14** hymns in their mouth. And Judith led this song of thanksgiving throughout all Israel, and all the people took up this praise.

#### CHAPTER 16

**1** And Judith said, “Begin unto my God with tambourines, sing unto my Lord with cymbals, render unto Him a psalm and

**2** a hymn; exalt ye and call upon His Name. For God, the Lord, is one who shatters wars, for in their encampments among the people hath He delivered me out of the hand of those who pursued me.

**3** Assyria came forth from the mountains from the north, it came with myriads of its power, whose multitude of them blocked up the torrents, and their horsemen covered the hills.

**4** He said that he would burn my borders, and slay my young men with the sword, and cast my sucklings to the ground, and give my infants for spoil, and plunder my virgins.

**5** The Lord Almighty hath thwarted them by the hand of a female.

**6** For their mighty one fell not by young men, neither did sons of Titans strike him, nor did tall giants set upon him, but Judith, the daughter of Merari, with the beauty of her countenance, did weaken him.

**7** For she put off the garment of her widowhood for the exaltation of those who suffer in Israel; she anointed her face with perfume,

**8** and bound her hair with a mitre, and took a gar-[ment of...]”
