¹² λειτουργεῖν αὐτοῖς, ἀνθ᾿ ὧν ἐλειτούργουν αὐτοῖς πρὸ προσώπου τῶν
  εἰδώλων αὐτῶν· καὶ ἐγένετο τῷ οἴκῳ Ἰσραὴλ εἰς κόλασιν ἀδι-
  κίας· ἕνεκεν τούτου ἦρα τὴν χεῖρά μου ἐπ᾿ αὐτούς, λέγει Κύριος
¹³ ὁ Θεός, καὶ λήψονται τὴν ἀνομίαν αὐτῶν· καὶ οὐκ ἐγγιοῦσι πρός
  με τοῦ ἱερατεύειν μοι, οὐδὲ τοῦ προσαγαγεῖν πρὸς τὰ ἅγια υἱῶν
  Ἰσραήλ, οὐδὲ πρὸς τὰ ἅγια τῶν ἁγίων μου· καὶ λήψονται τὴν ἀ-
¹⁴ τιμίαν αὐτῶν ἐν τῇ πλανήσει ᾗ ἐπλανήθησαν. Καὶ τάξουσιν αὐ-
  τοὺς φυλάσσειν φυλακὰς τοῦ οἴκου εἰς πάντα τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ,
¹⁵ καὶ εἰς πάντα ὅσα ἂν ποιήσωσιν οἱ ἱερεῖς οἱ Λευῖται, οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ
  Σαδδούκ, οἵτινες ἐφυλάξαντο τὰς φυλακὰς τῶν ἁγίων μου, ἐν τῷ
  πλανᾶσθαι τὸν οἶκον Ἰσραὴλ ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ· οὗτοι προσάξουσι πρός
  με τοῦ λειτουργεῖν μοι, καὶ στήσονται πρὸ προσώπου μου, τοῦ προ-
¹⁶ σφέρειν μοι θυσίαν, στέαρ καὶ αἷμα, λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεός. Οὗτοι
  εἰσελεύσονται εἰς τὰ ἅγιά μου, καὶ οὗτοι προσελεύσονται πρὸς τὴν
  τράπεζάν μου, τοῦ λειτουργεῖν μοι, καὶ φυλάξουσι τὰς φυλακὰς
¹⁷ μου. Καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῷ εἰσπορεύεσθαι αὐτοὺς τὰς πύλας τῆς αὔ-
  λῆς ἐσωτέρας, στολὰς λινοῦς ἐνδύσονται, καὶ οὐκ ἐνδύσονται ἔρια
  ἐν τῷ λειτουργεῖν αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ τῆς πύλης τῆς ἐσωτέρας αὐλῆς
¹⁸ καὶ ἔσω· καὶ κιδάρεις λινοῦς ἕξουσιν ἐπὶ ταῖς κεφαλαῖς αὐτῶν,
  καὶ περισκελὴ λινοῦ ἕξουσιν ἐπὶ ταῖς ὀσφύσιν αὐτῶν, καὶ οὐ περι-
¹⁹ ζώσονται βίᾳ. Καὶ ἐν τῷ ἐκπορεύεσθαι αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν αὐλὴν τὴν
  ἐξωτέραν πρὸς τὸν λαόν, ἐκδύσονται τὰς στολὰς αὐτῶν, ἐν αἷς
  αὐτοὶ λειτουργοῦσιν ἐν αὐταῖς· καὶ θήσουσιν αὐτὰς ἐν ταῖς ἐξέ-
  δραις τῶν ἁγίων, καὶ ἐνδύσονται στολὰς ἑτέρας, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἁγιά-
²⁰ σωσι τὸν λαὸν ἐν ταῖς στολαῖς αὐτῶν. Καὶ τὰς κεφαλὰς αὐτῶν
  οὐ μὴ ξυρήσονται, καὶ τὰς κόμας αὐτῶν οὐ μὴ ψιλώσουσι, καλύ-
²¹ πτοντες καλύψουσι τὰς κεφαλὰς αὐτῶν. Καὶ οἶνον οὐ μὴ πίωσιν πᾶς
  ἱερεύς, ἐν τῷ εἰσπορεύεσθαι αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν αὐλὴν τὴν ἐσωτέραν.
²² Καὶ χήραν καὶ ἐκβεβλημένην οὐ μὴ λήψονται ἑαυτοῖς εἰς γυναῖκα,
  ἀλλ᾿ ἢ παρθένον ἐκ τοῦ σπέρματος οἴκου Ἰσραήλ· καὶ χήρα ἐὰν
²³ γένηται ἐξ ἱερέως, λήψονται. Καὶ τὸν λαόν μου διδάξουσιν ἀναμέ-
  σον ἁγίου καὶ βεβήλου, καὶ ἀναμέσον καθαροῦ καὶ ἀναμέσον ἀ-
²⁴ καθάρτου γνωριοῦσιν αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἐπὶ κρίσιν αἵματος οὗτοι ἐπι-
  στήσονται τοῦ διακρίνειν· τὰ δικαιώματά μου δικαιώσουσι, καὶ
  τὰ κρίματά μου κρινοῦσι, καὶ τὰ νόμιμά μου καὶ τὰ προστάγματά
  μου ἐν πάσαις ταῖς ἑορταῖς μου φυλάξονται, καὶ τὰ σάββατά μου

**Chapter 44**

¹² to minister unto them, forasmuch as they ministered unto them before the face of their idols. And it became unto the house of Israel for a recompense of iniquity; wherefore I lifted up My hand against them, saith the Lord God.
¹³ And they shall bear their iniquity; and they shall not come near unto Me, to minister as priests unto Me, nor to come nigh unto the holy [things] of the sons of Israel, nor unto My holy of holies. But they shall bear their dishonor in the straying wherein they went astray.
¹⁴ And they shall appoint them to keep the charges of the House concerning all its service,
¹⁵ and concerning all that whatsoever the priests shall do. But the Levite priests, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of My holy things when the house of Israel went astray from Me, they shall come near to Me to minister unto Me, and they shall stand before My face,
¹⁶ to offer unto Me the sacrifice, the fat and the blood, saith the Lord God. These shall enter into My holy [place], and these shall draw near unto My table, to minister unto Me, and they shall keep My charges.
¹⁷ And it shall come to pass, when they enter in by the gates of the inner court, that they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool shall they wear, when they minister from the gate of the inner court,
¹⁸ and within. And linen turbans shall they have upon their heads, and linen breeches upon their loins; and they shall not gird themselves with force.
¹⁹ And when they go forth into the outer court, even unto the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they minister [in them]; and they shall lay them in the holy chambers, and shall put on other garments; and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments.
²⁰ And their heads shall they not shave, nor make bare their locks; but with covering shall they cover their heads.
²¹ And no priest shall drink wine, when they enter into the inner court.
²² And they shall not take for themselves a widow, nor her that is cast out, to be a wife; but they shall take virgins of the seed of the house of Israel; and a widow, if she be from a priest, they may take [her].
²³ And they shall teach My people [the difference] between the holy and the profane, and they shall make them know [the difference] between the clean and the unclean.
²⁴ And in a judgment of blood, these shall stand to judge. My righteous ordinances shall they execute, and My judgments shall they judge; and My statutes and My ordinances in all My feasts shall they keep, and My Sabbaths...
