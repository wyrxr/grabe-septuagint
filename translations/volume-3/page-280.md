16 δίαν μου, καὶ ποιμανοῦσιν ὑμᾶς ποιμένες μετ᾽ ἐπιστήμης. Καὶ
   ἔσται ἐὰν πληθυνθῆτε, καὶ αὐξηθῆτε ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς ἐν ταῖς ἡμέ-
   ραις ἐκείναις, λέγει Κύριος, οὐκ ἐροῦσιν ἔτι, κιβωτὸς διαθήκης
   ἁγίου Ἰσραήλ, οὐκ ἀναβήσεται ἐπὶ καρδίαν, καὶ οὐκ ὀνομασθή-
17 σεται ἐν αὐτῇ, οὐδὲ ἐπισκεφθήσεται, καὶ οὐ ποιηθήσεται ἔτι. Ἐν
   ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις, καὶ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ καλέσουσι τὴν Ἱε-
   ρουσαλήμ, θρόνον Κυρίου, καὶ συναχθήσονται εἰς αὐτὴν πάντα
   τὰ ἔθνη τῷ ὀνόματι Κυρίου εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ οὐ πορεύσονται
   ἔτι ὀπίσω τῶν ἐνθυμημάτων τῆς καρδίας αὐτῶν τῆς πονηρᾶς.
18 Καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις συνελεύσεται οἶκος Ἰούδα ἐπὶ τὸν
   οἶκον Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἥξουσιν ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ ἀπὸ γῆς βορρᾶ καὶ ἀπὸ
   πασῶν τῶν χωρῶν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, ἣν κατεκληρονόμησα τοὺς πα-
19 τέρας αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐγὼ εἶπα, γένοιτο Κύριε, ὅτι τάξω σε εἰς τέ-
   κνα, καὶ δώσω σοι γῆν ἐκλεκτὴν, κληρονομίαν Θεοῦ παντοκρά-
   τορος ἐθνῶν· καὶ εἶπα· πατέρα καλέσετέ με, καὶ ἀπ᾽ ἐμοῦ οὐκ
20 ἀποστραφήσεσθε. Πλὴν ὡς ἀθετεῖ γυνὴ εἰς τὸν συνόντα αὐτῇ,
21 οὕτως ἠθέτησεν εἰς ἐμὲ ὁ οἶκος Ἰσραήλ, λέγει Κύριος. Φωνὴ ἐκ
   χειλέων ἠκούσθη κλαυθμοῦ καὶ δεήσεως υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, ὅτι ἠδί-
   κησαν ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὐτῶν, ἐπελάθοντο Θεοῦ ἁγίου αὐτῶν, ἐπι-
22 στράφητε υἱοὶ ἐπιστρέφοντες, καὶ ἰάσομαι τὰ συντρίμματα ὑμῶν·
   ἰδοὺ δοῦλοι ἡμεῖς ἐσόμεθά σοι, ὅτι σὺ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν εἶ.
23 Ὄντως εἰς ψεῦδος ἦσαν οἱ βουνοὶ, καὶ ἡ δύναμις τῶν ὀρέων,
24 πλὴν διὰ Κυρίου Θεοῦ ἡμῶν ἡ σωτηρία τοῦ Ἰσραήλ. Ἡ δὲ αἰ-
   σχύνη κατηνάλωσε τοὺς μόχθους τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν, ἀπὸ νεό-
   τητος ἡμῶν, τὰ πρόβατα αὐτῶν, καὶ τοὺς μόσχους αὐτῶν, καὶ
25 τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας αὐτῶν. Ἐκοιμήθημεν ἐν
   τῇ αἰσχύνῃ ἡμῶν, καὶ ἐπεκάλυψεν ἡμᾶς ἡ ἀτιμία ἡμῶν, διότι
   ἔναντι τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν ἡμάρταμεν ἡμεῖς, καὶ οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν,
   ἀπὸ νεότητος ἡμῶν ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης, καὶ οὐκ ἠκούσαμεν
   τῆς φωνῆς Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν.

                                  ΚΕΦ. Δ΄. IV.

1 ΕΑΝ ἐπιστραφῇ Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς μὲ, λέγει Κύριος, ἐπιστρα-

### Chapter 3

**15** ...My heart; and they shall shepherd you with understanding.
**16** And it shall come to pass, when ye are multiplied and increased in the land in those days, saith the Lord, they shall say no more, 'The Ark of the Covenant of Holy Israel'; it shall not come to mind, neither shall it be named therein, nor shall it be visited, nor shall it be made anymore.
**17** In those days, and at that time, shall they call Jerusalem the Throne of the Lord; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, unto the Name of the Lord in Jerusalem; and they shall no more walk after the evil imaginations of their heart.
**18** And in those days shall the house of Judah be gathered unto the house of Israel, and they shall come together from the land of the north and from all the lands unto the land which I bequeathed to their fathers.
**19** And I said, "O Lord, may it be that I shall set thee among [My] children, and give thee a choice land, a heritage of God Almighty, Lord of nations." And I said, "Ye shall call Me Father, and ye shall not turn away from Me."
**20** Nevertheless, as a woman dealeth treacherously with him that is joined unto her, so hath the house of Israel dealt treacherously with Me," saith the Lord.
**21** A voice was heard from the lips of weeping and supplication of the children of Israel, because they have wrought wickedness in their ways; they have forgotten their Holy God. "Return, O ye children that turn, and I will heal your brokenness!"
**22** "Behold, we shall be Thy servants, for Thou art the Lord our God."
**23** Verily, the hills were but vanity, and the strength of the mountains [a deception];
**24** Yet through the Lord our God is the salvation of Israel. For the shame hath consumed the labours of our fathers from our youth, even their sheep, and their calves, and
**25** their sons, and their daughters. We have lain down in our shame, and our dishonour hath covered us; because before our God have we sinned, both we and our fathers, from our youth even unto this day, and we have not hearkened unto the voice of the Lord our God.

**1** "If Israel will return unto Me," saith the Lord, "then shall he truly return; and if he shall put away his abominations, and shall reverence My presence,
