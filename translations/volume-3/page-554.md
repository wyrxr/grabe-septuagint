ΚΕΦΑΛΑΙΟΝ Α´.
1 Ὅρασις Ἀβδιού. Τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τῇ Ἰδουμαίᾳ· ἀκοὴν ἤκουσα παρὰ Κυρίου, καὶ περιοχὴν εἰς τὰ ἔθνη ἐξαπέστειλεν·
2 ἀνάστητε, καὶ ἐξαναστῶμεν ἐπ᾽ αὐτὴν εἰς πόλεμον. Ἰδοὺ ὀλιγοστὸν δέδωκά σε ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν, ἠτιμωμένος σὺ εἶ σφόδρα·
3 ὑπερηφανία τῆς καρδίας σου ἐπῆρέ σε κατασκηνοῦντα ἐν ταῖς ὀπαῖς τῶν πετρῶν, ὑψῶν κατοικίαν αὐτοῦ, λέγων ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ· τίς με κατάξει ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν;
4 Ἐὰν μετεωρισθῇς ὡς ἀετός, καὶ ἐὰν ἀναμέσον τῶν ἄστρων θῇς νοσσιάν σου, ἐκεῖθεν κατάξω σε, λέγει Κύριος.
5 Εἰ κλέπται εἰσῆλθον πρὸς σέ, εἰ λῃσταὶ νυκτός, (ποῦ ἂν ἀπεῤῥίφης;) οὐκ ἂν ἔκλεψαν τὰ ἱκανὰ ἑαυτοῖς; καὶ εἰ τρυγηταὶ εἰσῆλθον πρὸς σέ, οὐκ ἂν ὑπελείποντο ἐπιφυλλίδα;
6 Πῶς ἐξηρευνήθη Ἠσαῦ, καὶ κατελήφθη αὐτοῦ τὰ κεκρυμμένα;
7 Ἕως τῶν ὁρίων σου ἐξαπέστειλάν σε· πάντες οἱ ἄνδρες τῆς διαθήκης σου ἀντέστησάν σοι, ἠδυνάσθησαν πρὸς σὲ ἄνδρες εἰρηνικοί σου· ἔθηκαν ἔνεδρα ὑποκάτω σου, οὐκ ἔστι σοι σύνεσις ἐν αὐτοῖς.
8 Ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ, λέγει Κύριος, ἀπολῶ σοφοὺς ἐκ τῆς Ἰδουμαίας, καὶ σύνεσιν ἐξ ὄρους Ἠσαῦ·
9 καὶ πτοηθήσονται οἱ μαχηταί σου οἱ ἐκ Θαιμάν, ὅπως ἐξαρθῇ ἄνθρωπος ἐξ ὄρους Ἠσαῦ.
10 διὰ τὴν σφαγήν, καὶ τὴν ἀσέβειαν ἀδελφοῦ σου Ἰακώβ· καὶ καλύψει σε αἰσχύνη, καὶ ἐξαρθήσῃ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα.
11 Ἀφ᾽ ἧς ἡμέρας ἀντέστης ἐξέναντίας ἐν ἡμέρᾳ, αἰχμαλωτευόντων ἀλλογενῶν δύναμιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀλλότριοι εἰσῆλθον εἰς τὰς πύλας αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπὶ Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἔβαλον κλήρους, καὶ σὺ ἦς ὡς εἷς ἐξ αὐτῶν.
12 Καὶ μὴ ἐπίδῃς ἡμέραν ἀδελφοῦ σου ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ἀλλοτρίων, καὶ μὴ ἐπιχαρῇς ἐπὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰούδα ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ἀπωλείας αὐτῶν, καὶ μὴ μεγαλορρημονήσῃς ἐν ἡμέρᾳ θλίψεως·
13 μηδὲ εἰσέλθῃς εἰς πύλας λαῶν ἐν ἡμέρᾳ πόνου αὐτῶν, μηδὲ ἐπίδῃς καὶ σὺ τὴν συναγωγὴν αὐτῶν ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ὀλέθρου αὐτῶν, μηδὲ συνεπιθῇ ἐπὶ τὴν δύναμιν αὐτῶν ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ἀπωλείας αὐτῶν·
14 μηδὲ στῇς ἐπὶ τὰς διεκβολὰς αὐτῶν,

#### The Prophecy of Obadiah

**Chapter 1**

**1** The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord God unto Idumaea: A report have I heard from the Lord, and a proclamation hath He sent forth among the nations:
**2** "Arise ye, and let us rise up against her for battle!" Behold, I have made thee small among the nations; thou art greatly despised.
**3** The pride of thine heart hath lifted thee up, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high, who saith in his heart, "Who shall bring me down to the ground?"
**4** Though thou mount up as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the Lord.
**5** If thieves had come unto thee, if robbers by night, (how utterly wouldst thou be cast down!) would they not have stolen [only] enough for themselves? And if grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave some gleanings?
**6** How is Esau searched out, and how are his hidden treasures found out?
**7** Unto thy borders have they sent thee away; all the men of thy covenant have risen against thee, thy men of peace have prevailed against thee; they have laid a snare beneath thee, nor was there understanding for thee concerning them.
**8** In that day, saith the Lord, will I not destroy the wise men out of Idumaea, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?
**9** And thy mighty men from Teman shall be dismayed, to the end that every man may be utterly cut off from the mount of Esau.
**10** For the slaughter, and for the impiety against thy brother Jacob, shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off forever.
**11** From the day that thou stoodest in opposition in the day when strangers carried away his host captive, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them.
**12** Neither shouldest thou have looked upon the day of thy brother in the day of strangers, neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction, neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of [their] distress.
**13** Neither shouldest thou have entered into the gates of My people in the day of their affliction, neither shouldest thou, even thou, have looked upon their gathered wealth in the day of their ruin, neither shouldest thou have laid hands upon their substance in the day of their destruction;
**14** neither shouldest thou have stood in their crossroads,
