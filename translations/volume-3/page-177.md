1 ΑΠΟΣΤΕΙΛΟΝ τὸν ἄρτον σου ἐπὶ πρόσωπον τοῦ ὕδατος·
ὅτι ἐν πλήθει τῶν ἡμερῶν εὑρήσεις αὐτόν.
2 Δὸς μερίδα τοῖς ἑπτά, καί γε τοῖς ὀκτώ· ὅτι οὐ γινώσκεις τί ἔσται πονηρὸν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν.
3 Ἐὰν πληρωθῶσιν τὰ νέφη ὑετοῦ, ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ἐκχεοῦσιν· καὶ ἐὰν πέσῃ ξύλον ἐν τῷ νότῳ, καὶ ἐὰν ἐν τῷ βορρᾷ, τόπῳ οὗ πεσεῖται τὸ ξύλον, ἐκεῖ ἔσται.
4 Τηρῶν ἄνεμον, οὐ σπερεῖ· καὶ βλέπων ἐν ταῖς νεφέλαις, οὐ θερίσει.
5 Ἐν οἷς οὐκ ἔστι γινώσκων τίς ἡ ὁδὸς τοῦ πνεύματος, ὡς ὀστᾶ ἐν γαστρὶ τῆς κυοφορούσης· οὕτως οὐ γνώσῃ τὰ ποιήματα τοῦ Θεοῦ, ὅσα ποιήσει τὰ σύμπαντα.
6 Ἐν πρωΐᾳ σπεῖρον τὸ σπέρμα σου, καὶ εἰς ἑσπέραν μὴ ἀφέτω ἡ χείρ σου· ὅτι οὐ γινώσκεις ποῖον στοιχήσει, ἢ τοῦτο ἢ τοῦτο, καὶ ἐὰν τὰ δύο ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ ἀγαθά.
7 Καὶ γλυκὺ τὸ φῶς, καὶ ἀγαθὸν τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς τοῦ βλέπειν σὺν τὸν ἥλιον·
8 ὅτι καὶ ἐὰν ἔτη πολλὰ ζήσεται ὁ ἄνθρωπος, ἐν πᾶσιν αὐτοῖς εὐφρανθήσεται, καὶ μνησθήσεται τὰς ἡμέρας τοῦ σκότους, ὅτι πολλαὶ ἔσονται· πᾶν τὸ ἐρχόμενον ματαιότης.
9 Εὐφραίνου νεανίσκε ἐν νεότητί σου, καὶ ἀγαθυνάτω σε ἡ καρδία σου ἐν ἡμέραις νεότητός σου, καὶ περιπάτει ἐν ὁδοῖς καρδίας σου ἀμώμως, καὶ ἐν ὁράσει ὀφθαλμῶν σου· καὶ γνῶθι ὅτι ἐπὶ πᾶσι τούτοις ἄξει σε ὁ Θεὸς ἐν κρίσει.
10 Καὶ ἀπόστησον θυμὸν ἀπὸ καρδίας σου, καὶ παράγαγε πονηρίαν ἀπὸ σαρκός σου· ὅτι ἡ νεότης καὶ ἡ ἄνοια ματαιότης.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΒ΄. ΧΙΙ.
1 ΚΑΙ μνήσθητι τοῦ κτίσαντός σε ἐν ἡμέραις νεότητός σου,
2 ἕως οὗ μὴ ἔλθωσιν ἡμέραι τῆς κακίας (σου), καὶ φθάσωσιν ἔτη ἐν οἷς ἐρεῖς· οὐκ ἔστι μοι ἐν αὐτοῖς θέλημα·
3 ἕως οὗ μὴ σκοτισθῇ ὁ ἥλιος καὶ τὸ φῶς, καὶ ἡ σελήνη καὶ οἱ ἀστέρες, καὶ ἐπιστρέψωσιν τὰ νέφη ὀπίσω τοῦ ὑετοῦ·
4 ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ᾗ ἂν σαλευθῶσι φύλακες τῆς οἰκίας, καὶ διαστραφῶσιν ἄνδρες τῆς δυνάμεως, καὶ ἔρρησαν αἱ ἀλήθουσαι, ὅτι ὀλιγώθησαν, καὶ σκοτάσουσιν αἱ βλέπουσαι ἐν ταῖς ὀπαῖς·
5 καὶ κλείσουσιν θύρας ἐν ἀγορᾷ ἐν ἀσθενείᾳ φωνῆς τῆς ἀληθούσης, καὶ ἀναστήσεται εἰς φωνὴν τοῦ στρουθίου, καὶ ταπεινω-

**CHAPTER 11**

**1** Cast thy bread upon the face of the waters;
    for thou shalt find it after many days.
**2** Give a portion to seven, and also to eight;
    for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.
**3** If the clouds be full of rain, they do empty themselves upon the earth;
    and if a tree fall toward the south, or toward the north,
    in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be.
**4** He that observeth the wind shall not sow;
    and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap.
**5** As one knoweth not what is the way of the spirit,
    nor how the bones [do grow] in the womb of her that is with child;
    even so thou shalt not know the works of God, Who maketh all things.
**6** In the morning sow thy seed,
    and in the evening let not thine hand cease;
    for thou knowest not which shall prosper,
    whether this or that, or whether both alike shall be good.
**7** Truly the light is sweet,
    and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun;
**8** For if a man live many years,
    and rejoice in them all;
    yet let him remember the days of darkness, for they shall be many;
    all that cometh is vanity.
**9** Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth,
    and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth;
    and walk in the ways of thy heart without blemish,
    and in the sight of thine eyes;
    but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment.
**10** Therefore remove vexation from thy heart,
    and put away evil from thy flesh;
    for youth and folly are vanity.

**CHAPTER 12**

**1** Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth,
**2** While the evil days [of thee] come not,
    nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say,
    I have no pleasure in them;
**3** Before the sun, and the light, and the moon, and the stars be darkened,
    and the clouds return after the rain;
**4** In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble,
    and the strong men shall bow themselves,
    and the grinders shall break, because they are few,
    and those that look out of the windows shall be darkened;
**5** And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low,
    and he shall rise up at the voice of a bird,
    and all the daughters of song shall be brought low;
