1236 ΙΕΡΕΜΙΑΣ ΚΕΦ. ΙΓʹ. ΙΔʹ.
    πιῶ αὐτοὺς ἄνδρα καὶ τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοὺς πατέ-
    ρας αὐτῶν, καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτῶν ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ· οὐκ ἐπιποθήσω, λέ-
    γει Κύριος, καὶ οὐ φείσομαι, καὶ οὐκ οἰκτειρήσω ἀπὸ διαφθορᾶς
15 ἀυτῶν. Ἀκούσατε, καὶ ἐνωτίσασθε, καὶ μὴ ἐπαίρεσθε, ὅτι Κύ-
16 ριος ἐλάλησε. Δότε τῷ Κυρίῳ Θεῷ ὑμῶν δόξαν πρὸ τοῦ συ-
    σκοτάσαι, καὶ πρὸ τοῦ προσκόψαι πόδας ὑμῶν ἐπ᾿ ὄρη σκο-
    τεινά· καὶ ἀναμενεῖτε εἰς φῶς, καὶ ἐκεῖ σκιὰ θανάτου, καὶ
17 τεθήσονται εἰς σκότος. Ἐὰν δὲ μὴ ἀκούσητε, κεκρυμμένως κλαύ-
    σεται ἡ ψυχὴ ὑμῶν ἀπὸ προσώπου ὕβρεως, καὶ δακρύουσα δα-
    κρύσει, καὶ κατατάξουσιν οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ ὑμῶν δάκρυα, ὅτι συνε-
18 τρίβη τὸ ποίμνιον Κυρίου. Εἴπατε τῷ βασιλεῖ καὶ τοῖς δυνα-
    στεύουσι, ταπεινώθητε, καθίσατε, ὅτι καθῃρέθη ἀπὸ τῆς κεφαλῆς
19 ὑμῶν στέφανος δόξης ὑμῶν. Πόλεις αἱ πρὸς νότον, συνε-
    κλείσθησαν, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ ἀνοίγων· ἀπωκίσθη Ἰούδας, συνετέ-
20 λεσεν ἀποικίαν τελείαν. Ἀνάλαβε τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς σου Ἰσραήλ,
    καὶ ἴδε τοὺς ἐρχομένους ἀπὸ βορρᾶ· ποῦ ἐστιν τὸ ποίμνιον ὃ ἐ-
    δόθη σοι, πρόβατα δόξης σου;
21 Τί ἐρεῖς ὅταν ἐπισκέπτωνταί σε; καὶ σὺ ἐδίδαξας αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ
    σὲ μαθητὰς εἰς ἀρχήν· οὐκ ὤδινες καθεζουσί σε, καθὼς γυναῖκα
    τίκτουσαν;
22 Καὶ ἐὰν εἴπῃς ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ σου, διατί ἀπήντησέ μοι ταῦτα;
    διὰ τὸ πλῆθος τῆς ἀδικίας σου ἀνεκαλύφθη τὰ ὀπίσθιά σου,
    παραδειγματισθῆναι τὰς πτέρνας σου.
23 Εἰ ἀλλάξεται Αἰθίψ τὸ δέρμα αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάρδαλις τὰ ποικίλ-
    ματα αὐτῆς, καὶ ὑμεῖς δυνήσεσθε εὐποιῆσαι μεμαθηκότες τὰ κακά.
24 Καὶ διέσπειρα αὐτοὺς, ὡς φρύγανα φερόμενα ὑπὸ ἀνέμου εἰς
    ἔρημον τόπον.
25 Οὕτως ὁ κλῆρός σου, καὶ μερίς τοῦ ἀπειθεῖν ὑμᾶς ἐμοί, λέγει
    Κύριος· ὡς ἐπελάθου νόμου μου, καὶ ἤλπισας ἐπὶ ψεύδεσι,
26 κἀγὼ ἀποκαλύψω τὰ ὀπίσθιά σου κατὰ πρόσωπόν σου, καὶ
    ὀφθήσεται ἡ ἀτιμία σου,
27 καὶ αἱ μοιχεῖαί σου, καὶ ὁ χρεμετισμός σου, καὶ ἡ ἀπαλλοτρίω-
    σις τῆς πορνείας σου· ἐπὶ τῶν βουνῶν, καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἀγροῖς ἑώ-
    ρακα τὰ βδελύγματά σου· οὐαί σοι Ἱερουσαλήμ, ὅτι οὐκ ἐκα-
    θαρίσθης ὀπίσω μου ἕως τίνος ἔτι.

### JEREMIAH 13

**14** I will drink them, even man and his brother, and their fathers and their sons, all together. I will not long [for them], saith the Lord, neither will I spare, nor will I have mercy [to deliver them] from their utter ruin.
**15** Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud, for the Lord hath spoken.
**16** Give glory to the Lord your God, before He cause darkness, and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains. And while ye wait for light, behold, there shall be the shadow of death, and they shall be set in thick darkness.
**17** But if ye will not hearken, your soul shall weep in secret because of [their] insolence; and weeping, it shall surely weep, and your eyes shall shed many tears, because the flock of the Lord is broken.
**18** Say unto the king and to them that hold power, "Humble yourselves, sit down; for the crown of your glory is cast down from your head."
**19** The cities of the south are shut up, and there was none to open them; Judah is carried away captive, having fully accomplished a complete captivity.
**20** Lift up thine eyes, O Israel, and behold them that come from the north. Where is the flock that was given thee, thy glorious sheep?
**21** What wilt thou say when they shall visit thee? For thou hast taught them [to be] thy masters, [even] from the first. Shall not pangs take hold of thee, as upon a woman in travail?
**22** And if thou shalt say in thine heart, "Wherefore have these things befallen me?" Because of the greatness of thine iniquity were thy hinder parts uncovered, to make a public example of thy heels.
**23** Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? Then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.
**24** Therefore will I scatter them as stubble driven by the wind into the wilderness.
**25** This is thy lot, and the portion for thy disobedience unto Me, saith the Lord; because thou hast forgotten My law, and trusted in lies.
**26** Therefore will I uncover thy hinder parts before thy face, and thy shame shall be manifest,
**27** even thy adulteries, and thy neighings, and the estrangement wrought by thy harlotry. Upon the hills and in the fields have I seen thine abominations. Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem! wilt thou not be made clean? [How long] yet shall it be?

**1** THE WORD OF THE LORD THAT CAME TO JEREMIAH CONCERNING THE DROUGHT.
**2** Judah mourneth,
