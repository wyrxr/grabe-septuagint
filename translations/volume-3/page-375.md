ἕως οὗ ἀπέρριψεν αὐτὸν ἐκ προσώπου αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἀπέστη Σεδεκίας τοῦ βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος.
4 Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἔτει τῷ ἐνάτῳ τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ, ἐν τῷ μηνὶ τῷ δεκάτῳ, δεκάτῃ τοῦ μηνός, ἦλθε Ναβουχοδονόσορ βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος, καὶ πᾶσα ἡ δύναμις αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ περιεχαράκωσαν αὐτήν, καὶ περιῳκοδόμησαν αὐτὴν τετραπέδοις λίθοις κύκλῳ.
5 Καὶ ἦλθεν ἡ πόλις εἰς συνοχήν, ἕως ἑνδεκάτου ἔτους τῷ βασιλεῖ Σεδεκίᾳ.
6 Ἐν μηνὶ τῷ τετάρτῳ ἐν ἐνάτῃ τοῦ μηνός, καὶ ἐστερεώθη ὁ λιμὸς ἐν τῇ πόλει, καὶ οὐκ ἦσαν ἄρτοι τῷ λαῷ τῆς γῆς.
7 Καὶ διεκόπη ἡ πόλις, καὶ πάντες οἱ ἄνδρες οἱ πολεμισταὶ ἔφυγον καὶ ἐξῆλθον ἐκ τῆς πόλεως νυκτὸς κατὰ τὴν ὁδὸν τῆς πύλης, ἀναμέσον τῆς πύλης, καὶ τοῦ προτειχίσματος, ὃ ἦν κατὰ τὸν κῆπον τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ οἱ Χαλδαῖοι ἐπὶ τῆς πόλεως κύκλῳ, καὶ ᾤχοντο ὁδὸν τὴν εἰς ἀραβά.
8 Καὶ κατεδίωξεν ἡ δύναμις τῶν Χαλδαίων ὀπίσω τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ κατέλαβον αὐτὸν ἐν τῷ πέραν Ἱεριχὼ, καὶ πάντες οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ διεσπάρησαν ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ.
9 Καὶ συνέλαβον τὸν βασιλέα, καὶ ἤγαγον αὐτὸν πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Βαβυλῶνος, εἰς Δεβλαθὰ εἰς γῆν Αἰμαθ· καὶ ἐλάλησεν αὐτῷ μετὰ κρίσεως.
10 Καὶ ἔσφαξε βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος τοὺς υἱοὺς Σεδεχίου κατ᾿ ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντας τοὺς ἄρχοντας Ἰούδα ἔσφαξεν εἰς Δεβλαθά.
11 Καὶ τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς Σεδεκίου ἐξετύφλωσε, καὶ ἔδησεν αὐτὸν ἐν πέδαις· καὶ ἤγαγεν αὐτὸν βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος εἰς Βαβυλῶνα, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὸν εἰς οἰκίαν μύλωνος, ἕως ἡμέρας τοῦ ἀποθανεῖν.
12 Καὶ ἐν μηνὶ τῷ πέμπτῳ, δεκάτῃ τοῦ μηνὸς (οὗτος ὁ ἐνιαυτὸς ἐννεακαιδέκατος τοῦ Ναβουχοδονόσορ βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος) ἦλθε Ναβουζαρδὰν ὁ ἀρχιμάγειρος ὁ ἑστηκὼς κατὰ πρόσωπον βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ,
13 καὶ ἐνέπρησε τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου, καὶ τὸν οἶκον τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ πάσας τὰς οἰκίας τῆς πόλεως, καὶ πᾶσαν οἰκίαν μεγάλην ἐνέπρησεν ἐν πυρί,
14 καὶ πᾶν τεῖχος (ἐν) Ἱερουσαλὴμ κύκλῳ καθεῖλεν ἡ δύναμις τῶν Χαλδαίων, ἡ μετὰ τοῦ ἀρχιμαγείρου.
15 Ἀπὸ δὲ τῶν πεφήντων τοῦ λαοῦ, καὶ τὸ λείμμα τοῦ λαοῦ, καὶ τοὺς καταλειφθέντας ἐν τῇ πόλει, καὶ τοὺς ἐμπίπτοντας, καὶ τοὺς ἐμπεπτωκότας πρὸς βασιλέα Βαβυλῶνος, καὶ τὸ λείμμα τοῦ πλήθους ἀπώκισε Ναβουζαρδὰν ὁ ἀρχιμάγειρος·
16 καὶ τοὺς καταλοίπους τοῦ λαοῦ κατέλιπεν ὁ ἀρχιμάγειρος εἰς ἀμπελουργοὺς καὶ εἰς γεωργούς.
17 Καὶ τοὺς στύλους τοὺς χαλκοῦς τοὺς ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου, καὶ τὰς βάσεις καὶ

**3** until He had cast him forth from His presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
**4** And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, and all his army, against Jerusalem; and they encamped round about it, and did build up against it [a siege-wall of] four-sided stones in a circle.
**5** And the city came into sore distress, even until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
**6** In the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, the famine was strengthened in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.
**7** And the city was broken through, and all the men of war fled and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the gate, between the gates and the outer wall, which was by the king's garden; and the Chaldeans being round about the city, they went their way unto the Arabah.
**8** And the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and they overtook him in the plains of Jericho; and all his attendants were scattered from him.
**9** And they seized the king, and brought him unto the king of Babylon, to Deblatha in the land of Hamath; and he pronounced judgment upon him.
**10** And the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and all the princes of Judah he slaughtered in Deblatha.
**11** And he did put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him in fetters; and the king of Babylon brought him to Babylon, and put him in a house of the mill, until the day of his death.
**12** And in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month (this was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon), Nebuzaradan the chief cook, who stood before the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem,
**13** and he burned the house of the Lord, and the king's house, and all the houses of the city; yea, every great house he burned with fire.
**14** And all the wall [of] Jerusalem round about, the army of the Chaldeans that was with the chief cook did tear down.
**15** And from those who had made themselves manifest of the people, and the remnant of the people, and those who were left in the city, and those who were defecting, and those who had already fallen away unto the king of Babylon, even the remainder of the multitude, Nebuzaradan the chief cook carried away captive;
**16** but the chief cook left of the remaining people [some] as vine-dressers and as farmers.
**17** And the pillars of bronze that were in the house of the Lord, and the bases, and
