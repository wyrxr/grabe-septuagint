σαι, συναγωγὴ μεγάλη, καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς οἱ καθήμενοι ἐν γῇ
Αἰγύπτῳ, ἐν Παθούρῃ, λέγοντες· ὁ λόγος ὃν ἐλάλησας πρὸς 16
ἡμᾶς τῷ ὀνόματι Κυρίου, οὐκ ἀκουσόμεθά σου. 17 ὅτι ποιοῦντες
ποιήσομεν πάντα τὸν λόγον, ὃς ἐξελεύσεται ἐκ τοῦ στόματος
ἡμῶν· θυμιᾶν τῇ βασιλίσσῃ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ σπένδειν αὐτῇ
σπονδάς, καθὰ ἐποιήσαμεν ἡμεῖς καὶ οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν, καὶ
οἱ βασιλεῖς ἡμῶν, καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες ἡμῶν, ἐν πόλεσιν Ἰούδα
καὶ ἔξωθεν Ἱερουσαλήμ· καὶ ἐπλήσθημεν ἄρτων, καὶ ἐγενόμεθα
χρηστοί, καὶ κακὰ οὐκ εἴδομεν. 18 Καὶ ὡς διελίπομεν θυμιῶντες
τῇ βασιλίσσῃ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ σπένδοντες αὐτῇ σπονδάς, ἠλαττονώθημεν πάντες, καὶ ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ καὶ ἐν λιμῷ ἐξελίπομεν.
19 Καὶ ὅτι θυμιῶμεν ἡμεῖς τῇ βασιλίσσῃ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ εἰ ἐσπείσαμεν αὐτῇ σπονδάς, μὴ ἄνευ τῶν ἀνδρῶν ἡμῶν ἐποιήσαμεν αὐτῇ
Καυδῶνας, καὶ ἐσπείσαμεν αὐτῇ σπονδάς; 20 Καὶ εἶπεν Ἱερεμίας
παντὶ τῷ λαῷ, τοῖς δυνατοῖς καὶ ταῖς γυναιξί, καὶ παντὶ τῷ
λαῷ τοῖς ἀποκριθεῖσιν αὐτῷ λόγους, λέγων· 21 οὐχὶ τοῦ θυμιάματος, οὗ ἐθυμιάσατε ἐν ταῖς πόλεσιν Ἰούδα, καὶ ἔξωθεν Ἱερουσαλήμ, ὑμεῖς καὶ οἱ πατέρες ὑμῶν, καὶ οἱ βασιλεῖς ὑμῶν, καὶ
οἱ ἄρχοντες ὑμῶν, καὶ ὁ λαὸς γῆς, ἐμνήσθη Κύριος ; καὶ ἀνέβη
ἐπὶ τὴν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ; 22 Καὶ οὐκ ἠδύνατο Κύριος ἔτι φέρειν ἀπὸ
προσώπου πονηρίας πραγμάτων ὑμῶν, ἀπὸ τῶν βδελυγμάτων ὧν
ἐποιήσατε· καὶ ἐγένετο ἡ γῆ ὑμῶν εἰς ἐρήμωσιν, καὶ εἰς ἄβατον,
καὶ εἰς ἀρὰν, παρὰ τὸ μὴ ὑπάρχειν ἐνοικοῦντα, ὡς ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ
ταύτῃ, 23 ἀπὸ προσώπου ὧν ἐθυμιάτε, καὶ ὧν ἡμάρτετε τῷ Κυρίῳ·
Καὶ οὐκ ἠκούσατε τῆς φωνῆς Κυρίου, καὶ ἐν τοῖς προστάγμασιν
αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐν τῷ νόμῳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐν τοῖς μαρτυρίοις αὐτοῦ οὐκ
ἐπορεύθητε, καὶ ἐπελάβετο ὑμῶν τὰ κακὰ ταῦτα, καθὼς ἡ ἡμέρα αὕτη. 24 Καὶ εἶπεν Ἱερεμίας παντὶ τῷ λαῷ, καὶ ταῖς γυναιξίν·
ἀκούσατε λόγον Κυρίου πᾶς Ἰούδα οἱ ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτου· 25 οὕτως
εἶπε Κύριος τῶν δυνάμεων ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ, λέγων· ὑμεῖς καὶ γυναῖκες ὑμῶν ἐν τῷ στόματι ὑμῶν ἐλαλήσατε, καὶ ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν
ὑμῶν ἐπληρώσατε, λέγουσαι, ποιοῦσαι ποιήσομεν τὰς ὁμολογίας
ἡμῶν ἃς ὡμολογήσαμεν, θυμιᾶν τῇ βασιλίσσῃ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ
σπένδειν αὐτῇ σπονδάς· ἐμμείνατε ἐμενείνατε ταῖς ὁμολογίαις
ὑμῶν, καὶ ποιοῦσαι ἐποιήσατε τὰς εὐχὰς ὑμῶν. 26 Διὰ τοῦτο ἀκούσατε λόγον Κυρίου, πᾶς Ἰούδα οἱ καθήμενοι ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ·

**JEREMIAH 44**

**15** ...a great multitude, and all the people who dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathures, saying:
**16** "The word which thou hast spoken unto us in the Name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee.
**17** For we will surely perform every word that proceedeth forth from our mouth; [namely,] to burn incense unto the Queen of Heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, just as we have done, both we and our fathers, and our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then were we filled with bread, and became prosperous, and saw no evil.
**18** But since we ceased burning incense unto the Queen of Heaven, and pouring out drink offerings unto her, we have all been diminished, and by the sword and by famine have we been consumed."
**19** (And the women answered, saying:) "And when we burned incense unto the Queen of Heaven, and poured out drink offerings unto her, did we make for her [sacred] cakes and pour out drink offerings unto her without our husbands?"
**20** Then Jeremiah spake unto all the people, unto the mighty men and unto the women, and unto all the people who had answered him with words, saying:
**21** "Is it not of the incense that ye have burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem—ye, and your fathers, and your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land—that the Lord hath remembered, and it hath come up upon His heart?
**22** And the Lord could no longer bear [it] from the face of the wickedness of your deeds, from the face of the abominations which ye have committed; therefore is your land become a desolation, and an impassable waste, and a curse, for there is none to dwell therein, even as it is this day,
**23** from the face of those [idols] to which ye offered incense, and wherein ye sinned against the Lord. And ye hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord, neither walked ye in His commandments, nor in His law, nor in His testimonies; and these evils have overtaken you, even as this day."
**24** And Jeremiah spake unto all the people, and unto the women: "Hear ye the word of the Lord, all Judah who are in the land of Egypt.
**25** Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, saying: Ye and your wives have spoken with your mouth, and with your hands have ye fulfilled, saying: 'We will surely perform our vows which we have vowed, to burn incense unto the Queen of Heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her.' Ye have persisted, ye have persisted in your vows, and ye have surely performed your oaths!
**26** Therefore hear ye the word of the Lord, all Judah who dwell in the land of Egypt:"
