**ΨΑΛΜ. ΝΑʹ. LI.**
10 καὶ ἐνεδυναμώθη ἐπὶ τῇ ματαιότητι αὐτοῦ. Ἐγὼ δὲ ὡσεὶ ἐλαία
    κατάκαρπος ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ Θεοῦ· ἤλπισα ἐπὶ τὸ ἔλεος τοῦ Θεοῦ
11 εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, καὶ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τοῦ αἰῶνος. Ἐξομολογήσομαί
    σοι εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, ὅτι ἐποίησας· καὶ ὑπομενῶ τὸ ὄνομά σου, ὅτι
    χρηστὸν ἐναντίον τῶν ὁσίων σου.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ΝΒʹ. LII.**

1.2 ΕΙΣ τὸ τέλος, ὑπὲρ Μαελὲθ, συνέσεως τῷ Δαυίδ. Εἶπεν ἄφρων
    ἐν καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ, οὐκ ἔστι Θεός· διέφθειραν καὶ ἐβδελύχθησαν ἐν
3 ἀνομίαις, οὐκ ἔστι ποιῶν ἀγαθόν· ὁ Θεὸς ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ διέκυ-
    ψεν ἐπὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς τῶν ἀνθρώπων, τοῦ ἰδεῖν, εἰ ἔστι συνιῶν, ἢ
4 ἐκζητῶν τὸν Θεόν. Πάντες ἐξέκλιναν, ἅμα ἠχρειώθησαν· οὐκ ἔστι
5 ποιῶν ἀγαθὸν, οὐκ ἔστιν ἕως ἑνός. Οὐχὶ γνώσονται πάντες οἱ ἐρ-
    γαζόμενοι τὴν ἀνομίαν, οἱ κατεσθίοντες τὸν λαόν μου βρώσει ἄρ-
6 του; τὸν Θεὸν οὐκ ἐπεκαλέσαντο. Ἐκεῖ ἐφοβήθησαν φόβον, οὗ οὐκ
    ἦν φόβος· ὅτι ὁ Θεὸς διεσκόρπισεν ὀστᾶ ἀνθρωπαρέσκων· κατη-
    σχύνθησαν, ὅτι ὁ Θεὸς ἐξουδένωσεν αὐτούς.
7 Τίς δώσει ἐκ Σιὼν τὸ σωτήριον τοῦ Ἰσραήλ; ἐν τῷ ἀποστρέψαι
    τὴν Θεὸν τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ, ἀγαλλιάσεται Ἰακώβ,
    καὶ εὐφρανθήσεται Ἰσραήλ.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ΝΓʹ. LIII.**

1.2 ΕΙΣ τὸ τέλος, ἐν ὕμνοις συνέσεως τῷ Δαυίδ, ἐν τῷ ἐλθεῖν
    τοὺς Ζειφαίους, καὶ εἰπεῖν τῷ Σαούλ· οὐκ ἰδοὺ Δαυὶδ κέκρυπται
3 παρ᾿ ἡμῖν; Ὁ Θεὸς ἐν τῷ ὀνόματί σου σῶσόν με, καὶ ἐν τῇ δυ-
4 νάμει σου κρινόν με. Ὁ Θεὸς εἰσάκουσον τῆς προσευχῆς μου, ἐνώ-
5 τισαι τὰ ῥήματα τοῦ στόματός μου· ὅτι ἀλλότριοι ἐπανέστησαν
    ἐπ᾿ ἐμὲ, καὶ κραταιοὶ ἐζήτησαν τὴν ψυχήν μου· οὐ προέθεντο τὸν
6 Θεὸν ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν. Διάψαλμα. Ἰδοὺ γὰρ ὁ Θεὸς βοηθεῖ μοι,
7 καὶ ὁ Κύριος ἀντιλήπτωρ τῆς ψυχῆς μου· ἀποστρέψει τὰ κακὰ
8 τοῖς ἐχθροῖς μου· ἐν τῇ ἀληθείᾳ σου ἐξολόθρευςον αὐτούς. Ἑκου-
    σίως θύσω σοι, ἐξομολογήσομαι τῷ ὀνόματί σου Κύριε, ὅτι ἀγα-
9 θόν· ὅτι ἐκ πάσης θλίψεώς ἐῤῥύσω με, καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἐχθροῖς μου
    ἐπεῖδεν ὁ ὀφθαλμός μου.

**PSALM LI. (KJV Ps 52)**

10 And he was strengthened in his vanity.
But I am as a fruitful olive tree in the house of God;
I have hoped in the mercy of God
11 unto the age, and unto the age of the age.
I will confess unto Thee forever, because Thou hast done [it];
and I will wait upon Thy Name, for it is good
before Thy saints.

**PSALM LII. (KJV Ps 53)**

Unto the End, concerning Maeleth, A Psalm of understanding for David.

1 The fool hath said in his heart: "There is no God."
2 They have corrupted and become abominable in iniquities;
there is none that doeth good.
3 God looked down from heaven upon the sons of men,
to see if there be any that understandeth or seeketh God.
4 All have turned aside, together they have become unprofitable;
there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
5 Shall not all those who work iniquity know,
who devour My people as the eating of bread?
They have not called upon God.
6 There were they seized with fear, where there was no fear;
for God hath scattered the bones of men-pleasers;
they were put to shame, for God hath scorned them.
7 Who shall give out of Zion the salvation of Israel?
When God turneth back the captivity of His people,
Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

**PSALM LIII. (KJV Ps 54)**

Unto the End, in hymns, A Psalm of understanding for David,
when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, "Behold, is not David hidden with us?"

3 O God, in Thy Name save me,
and in Thy might judge me.
4 O God, hear my prayer;
give ear unto the words of my mouth.
5 For strangers have risen up against me,
and mighty men have sought my soul;
they have not set God before them. Selah.
6 For behold, God helpeth me,
7 and the Lord is the helper of my soul;
He shall turn back the evils upon mine enemies;
8 in Thy truth destroy them.
Willingly will I sacrifice unto Thee;
I will confess to Thy Name, O Lord, for it is good;
9 for out of all trouble hast Thou rescued me,
and upon mine enemies hath mine eye looked down.
