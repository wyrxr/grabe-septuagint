**ΨΑΛΜ. ΡΗ΄. CVIII.**
18 μακρυνθήσεται ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐνεδύσατο κατάραν ὡς ἱμάτιον,
19 καὶ εἰσῆλθεν ὡσεὶ ὕδωρ εἰς τὰ ἔγκατα αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὡσεὶ ἔλαιον ἐν
20 τοῖς ὀστέοις αὐτοῦ· γενηθήτω αὐτῷ ὡς ἱμάτιον ὃ περιβάλλεται,
21 καὶ ὡσεὶ ζώνη ἣν διαπαντὸς περιζώννυται. Τοῦτο τὸ ἔργον τῶν
22 ἐνδιαβαλλόντων με παρὰ Κυρίου, καὶ τῶν λαλούντων πονηρὰ κατὰ
23 τῆς ψυχῆς μου. Καὶ σὺ Κύριε Κύριε ποίησον μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ (ἔλεος)
24 ἕνεκεν τοῦ ὀνόματός σου, ὅτι χρηστὸν τὸ ἔλεός σου· ῥῦσαί με, ὅτι
25 πτωχὸς καὶ πένης εἰμὶ ἐγώ, καὶ ἡ καρδία μου τετάρακται ἐντός
26 μου. Ὡσεὶ σκιὰ ἐν τῷ ἐκκλίναι αὐτήν, ἀντανῃρέθην· ἐξετινάχθην
27 ὡσεὶ ἀκρίδες. Τὰ γόνατά μου ἠσθένησαν ἀπὸ νηστείας, καὶ ἡ σάρξ
28 μου ἠλλοιώθη δι᾿ ἔλεον. Καὶ ἐγὼ ἐγενήθην ὄνειδος αὐτοῖς· ἴδοσάν
29 με, ἐσάλευσαν κεφαλὰς αὐτῶν. Βοήθησόν μοι· Κύριε ὁ Θεός μου,
30 (καὶ) σῶσόν με κατὰ τὸ ἔλεός σου· καὶ γνώτωσαν ὅτι ἡ χείρ σου
31 αὕτη, καὶ σὺ Κύριε ἐποίησας αὐτήν. Καταράσονται αὐτοί, καὶ σὺ
32 εὐλογήσεις· οἱ ἐπανιστάμενοί μοι αἰσχυνθήτωσαν, ὁ δὲ δοῦλός
33 σου εὐφρανθήσεται. Ἐνδυσάσθωσαν οἱ ἐνδιαβάλλοντές με ἐντρο-
34 πὴν, καὶ περιβαλέσθωσαν ὡς διπλοΐδα αἰσχύνην αὐτῶν. Ἐξομο-
35 λογήσομαι τῷ Κυρίῳ σφόδρα ἐν τῷ στόματί μου, καὶ ἐν μέσῳ
36 πολλῶν αἰνέσω αὐτόν· ὅτι παρέστη ἐκ δεξιῶν πένητος, τοῦ σῶσαι
37 ἐκ τῶν καταδιωκόντων τὴν ψυχήν μου.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ΡΘ΄. CIX.**

1 Τῷ Δαυΐδ ψαλμός. Εἶπεν ὁ Κύριος τῷ κυρίῳ μου· κάθου ἐκ
2 δεξιῶν μου, ἕως ἂν θῶ τοὺς ἐχθρούς σου ὑποπόδιον τῶν ποδῶν
3 σου. Ῥάβδον δυνάμεώς σου ἐξαποστελεῖ Κύριος ἐκ Σιῶν· (καὶ)
4 κατακυρίευε ἐν μέσῳ τῶν ἐχθρῶν σου. Μετὰ σοῦ ἡ ἀρχὴ ἐν ἡμέ-
5 ρᾳ τῆς δυνάμεώς σου, ἐν ταῖς λαμπρότησι τῶν ἁγίων (σου)· ἐκ
6 γαστρὸς πρὸ ἑωσφόρου ἐγέννησά σε. Ὤμοσε Κύριος, καὶ οὐ μετα-
7 μεληθήσεται· Σὺ ἱερεὺς εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, κατὰ τὴν τάξιν Μελχισε-
8 δέκ. Κύριος ἐκ δεξιῶν σου συνέθλασεν ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ὀργῆς αὐτοῦ βα-
9 σιλεῖς· κρινεῖ ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι, πληρώσει πτώματα, συνθλάσει κε-
10 φαλὰς ἐπὶ γῆς πολλῶν. Ἐκ χειμάρρου ἐν ὁδῷ πίεται (ὕδωρ)· διὰ
11 τοῦτο ὑψώσει κεφαλήν.

**PSALM CVIII.**

18 [but] far from him. And he clothed himself with cursing as with a garment,
19 and it entered as water into his inward parts,
    and as oil into his bones.
20 Let it be unto him as a garment wherewith he is clothed,
21 and as a girdle wherewith he is continually girt.
    This is the work of them that slander me from the Lord,
22 and of them that speak evil against my soul.
23 And Thou, O Lord, O Lord, deal with me, [showing] mercy,
24 for Thy Name’s sake, for gracious is Thy mercy; deliver me,
25 for I am poor and needy, and my heart is troubled within me.
26 Like a shadow when it declines, I am taken away;
    I am shaken off as the locusts.
27 My knees are grown weak from fasting,
    and my flesh is altered, [a cause] for pity.
28 And I am become a reproach unto them; when they saw me,
29 they shook their heads. Help me, O Lord my God,
30 [and] save me according to Thy mercy; and let them know
    that this is Thy hand, and that Thou, O Lord, hast made it.
31 Let them curse, but Thou shalt bless;
    let them that rise up against me be put to shame,
    but Thy servant shall rejoice.
32 Let them that slander me be clothed with dishonour,
33 and let them be covered with their shame as with a double cloak.
34 I will confess to the Lord exceedingly with my mouth,
35 and in the midst of many will I praise Him;
36 for He hath stood at the right hand of the poor,
    to save him from them that persecute his soul.

**PSALM CIX.**

**A Psalm of David.**
1 The Lord said unto my Lord: "Sit Thou at My right hand,
2 until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool."
3 The Rod of Thy strength shall the Lord send forth from Zion;
    [and] rule Thou in the midst of Thine enemies.
4 With Thee is the dominion in the day of Thy power,
    in the splendours of the saints;
5 from the womb, before the morning star, have I begotten Thee.
6 The Lord hath sworn, and He will not repent:
    "Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchizedek."
7 The Lord at Thy right hand hath crushed in the day of His wrath, kings;
8 He shall judge among the nations, He shall fill [the land with] corpses,
9 He shall shatter heads over many lands.
10 From the torrent by the way He shall drink [water];
11 therefore shall He lift up His head.
