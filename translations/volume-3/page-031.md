**ΨΑΛΤΗΡΙΟΝ.**
**ΨΑΛΜ. ΜΓ΄. XLIII.**

Εἰς τὸ τέλος τοῖς υἱοῖς Κορέ εἰς σύνεσιν (Ψαλμός).
1,2 Ὁ Θεὸς ἐν τοῖς ὠσὶν ἡμῶν ἠκούσαμεν, οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν ἀνήγγειλαν
    ἡμῖν ἔργον ὃ εἰργάσω ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις αὐτῶν, ἐν ἡμέραις ἀρχαίαις.
3 Ἡ χείρ σου ἔθνη ἐξωλέθρευσε, καὶ κατεφύτευσας αὐτούς· ἐκάκωσας
    λαούς, καὶ ἐξέβαλες αὐτούς.
4 Οὐ γὰρ ἐν τῇ ῥομφαίᾳ αὐτῶν ἐκληρονόμησαν γῆν, καὶ ὁ βραχίων αὐτῶν οὐκ ἔσωσεν αὐτούς·
    ἀλλ᾽ ἡ δεξιά σου, καὶ ὁ βραχίων σου, καὶ ὁ φωτισμὸς τοῦ προσώπου
    σου, ὅτι εὐδόκησας ἐν αὐτοῖς.
5 Σὺ εἶ αὐτὸς ὁ βασιλεύς μου καὶ ὁ Θεός μου, ὁ ἐντελλόμενος τὰς σωτηρίας Ἰακώβ. Ἐν σοὶ
    τοὺς ἐχθροὺς ἡμῶν κερατιοῦμεν, καὶ ἐν τῷ ὀνόματί σου ἐξουδενώσομεν
    τοὺς ἐπανιστανομένους ἡμῖν.
6 Οὐ γὰρ ἐπὶ τῷ τόξῳ μου ἐλπιῶ, καὶ ἡ ῥομφαία μου οὐ σώσει με˙
7 ἔσωσας γὰρ ἡμᾶς ἐκ τῶν θλιβόντων ἡμᾶς, καὶ τοὺς μισοῦντας ἡμᾶς κατήσχυνας.
8 Ἐν τῷ Θεῷ ἐπαινεθησόμεθα ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν, καὶ ἐν τῷ ὀνόματί σου
    ἐξομολογησόμεθα εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα. Διάψαλμα.
9 Νυνὶ δὲ ἀπώσω καὶ κατήσχυνας ἡμᾶς, καὶ οὐκ ἐξελεύσῃ ὁ Θεὸς ἐν ταῖς δυνάμεσιν
    ἡμῶν.
10 Ἀπέστρεψας ἡμᾶς εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω παρὰ τοὺς ἐχθροὺς ἡμῶν,
    καὶ οἱ μισοῦντες ἡμᾶς διήρπαζον ἑαυτοῖς.
11 Ἔδωκας ἡμᾶς ὡς πρόβατα βρώσεως, καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι διέσπειρας ἡμᾶς.

**PSALM XLIII.**

Unto the End, for the sons of Korah, a Psalm of Understanding.
1 O God, we have heard with our ears,
Our fathers have declared unto us,
The work which Thou didst perform in their days, in the days of old.
2 Thy hand did cast out the nations, and didst plant them;
Thou didst afflict the peoples, and didst cast them out.
3 For not by their sword did they inherit the land,
Neither did their own arm save them;
But by Thy right hand, and by Thine arm,
And by the light of Thy countenance,
Because Thou didst delight in them.
4 Thou art He Himself, my King and my God,
Who commandest the deliverances of Jacob.
5 Through Thee will we thrust down our enemies with the horn,
And in Thy Name will we bring to naught
Those that rise up against us.
6 For I will not hope in my bow,
Neither shall my sword save me;
7 For Thou hast saved us from them that afflict us,
And hast put to shame those that hate us.
8 In God shall we make our boast all the day long,
And in Thy Name will we give praise forever. Selah.
9 But now Thou hast cast off and put us to shame,
And Thou, O God, goest not forth with our armies.
10 Thou hast turned us back from the face of our enemies,
And they which hate us did plunder for themselves.
11 Thou hast given us as sheep appointed for meat,
And among the nations hast Thou scattered us.
