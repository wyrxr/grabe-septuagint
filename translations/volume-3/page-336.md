36 ἀπὸ τῶν κριῶν τῶν προβάτων. Φωνὴ κραυγῆς τῶν ποιμένων,
καὶ ἀλαλαγμὸς τῶν προβάτων καὶ τῶν κριῶν, ὅτι ὠλέθρευσε Κύ-
37 ριος τὰ βοσκήματα αὐτῶν, καὶ παύσεται τὰ κατάλοιπα τῆς εἰ-
38 ρήνης ἀπὸ προσώπου ὀργῆς θυμοῦ μου. Κατέλιπέ με ὥσπερ λέων
κατάλυμα αὐτοῦ, ὅτι ἐγενήθη ἡ γῆ αὐτῶν εἰς ἄβατον ἀπὸ προ-
σώπου μαχαίρας τῆς μεγάλης, καὶ ἀπὸ προσώπου ὀργῆς τοῦ
θυμοῦ αὐτοῦ.

1 ΕΝ ΑΡΧΗ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ ΙΩΑΚΕΙΜ ΥΙΟΥ ΙΩΣΙΑ βασιλέως
Ἰούδα ΕΓΕΝΗΘΗ Ο ΛΟΓΟΣ ΟΥΤΟΣ ΠΑΡΑ ΚΥΡΙΟΥ,
2 λέγων· οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος· στῆθι ἐν αὐλῇ οἴκου Κυρίου, καὶ
χρηματιεῖς πᾶσι τοῖς Ἰουδαίοις, καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς ἐρχομένοις προσ-
κυνεῖν ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου, ἅπαντας τοὺς λόγους, οὓς συνέταξά σοι
3 αὐτοῖς χρηματίσαι, μὴ ἀφέλῃς ῥῆμα. Ἴσως ἀκούσονται, καὶ ἀπο-
στραφήσονται ἕκαστος ἀπὸ ὁδοῦ αὐτοῦ τῆς πονηρᾶς, καὶ παύσο-
μαι ἀπὸ τῶν κακῶν, ὧν ἐγὼ λογίζομαι τοῦ ποιῆσαι αὐτοῖς ἔνε-
4 κεν τῶν πονηρῶν ἐπιτηδευμάτων αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτούς·
οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος· ἐὰν μὴ ἀκούσητέ μου, τοῦ πορεύεσθαι ἐν τοῖς
5 νόμοις μου οἷς ἔδωκα κατὰ πρόσωπον ὑμῶν, εἰσακούειν τῶν λό-
γων μου καὶ τῶν παίδων μου τῶν προφητῶν, οὓς ἐγὼ ἀποστέλ-
λω πρὸς ὑμᾶς ὄρθρου, καὶ ἀπέστειλα, καὶ οὐκ εἰσηκούσατέ μου,
6 καὶ δώσω τὸν οἶκον τοῦτον ὥσπερ Σηλὼ, καὶ τὴν πόλιν ταύτην
7 δώσω εἰς κατάραν πᾶσι τοῖς ἔθνεσι πάσης τῆς γῆς. Καὶ ἤκου-
σαν οἱ ἱερεῖς καὶ οἱ ψευδοπροφῆται, καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς τοῦ Ἱερεμίου
8 λαλοῦντος τοὺς λόγους τούτους ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου. Καὶ ἐγένετο Ἱε-
ρεμίου παυσαμένου λαλοῦντος πάντα ὅσα συνέταξεν αὐτῷ Κύ-
ριος λαλῆσαι παντὶ τῷ λαῷ, καὶ συνελάβοσαν αὐτὸν οἱ ἱερεῖς,
καὶ οἱ ψευδοπροφῆται, καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς λέγων, θανάτῳ ἀποθανή-
9 ὅτι ἐπροφήτευσας τῷ ὀνόματι Κυρίου λέγων, ὥσπερ Σηλὼ ἔσται
ὁ οἶκος οὗτος, καὶ ἡ πόλις αὕτη ἐρημωθήσεται ἀπὸ ἐνοικούντων.
10 Καὶ ἐξεκλησιάσθη πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ἐπὶ Ἱερεμίαν ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου. Καὶ
ἤκουσαν οἱ ἄρχοντες Ἰούδα τῶν λόγων τούτων, καὶ ἀνέβησαν
ἐξ οἴκου τοῦ βασιλέως εἰς οἶκον Κυρίου, καὶ ἐκάθισαν ἐν προ-
11 θύροις πύλης Κυρίου τῆς καινῆς. Καὶ εἶπαν οἱ ἱερεῖς, καὶ οἱ

**Jeremiah, Chapter 32**

**36** from the rams of the flock. The voice of the crying of the shepherds, and the wailing of the sheep and of the rams, for the Lord hath destroyed their flocks,
**37** and the remnant of peace shall cease from the face of the wrath of My fury.
**38** He hath forsaken Me as a lion [doth] his lair; for their land is become a desolation from before the face of the great sword, and from before the face of the wrath of His fury.

**Jeremiah, Chapter 33**

**1** In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came from the Lord,
**2** saying, "Thus saith the Lord: Stand thou in the court of the house of the Lord, and speak unto all the Jews, and unto all them that come to worship in the house of the Lord, all the words which I have commanded thee to speak unto them; diminish not a word.
**3** Peradventure they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way, and I will cease from the evils which I purpose to do unto them because of the wickedness of their doings.
**4** And thou shalt say unto them, 'Thus saith the Lord: If ye will not hearken unto Me, to walk in My laws, which I have set before your face,
**5** and to hearken unto the words of My servants the prophets, whom I send unto you early [in the morning], and whom I have sent, but ye have not hearkened unto Me;
**6** then will I make this house like Shiloh, and this city will I make a curse unto all the nations of all the earth.'"
**7** And the priests and the false prophets, and all the people, heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the Lord.
**8** And it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the Lord had commanded him to speak unto all the people, that the priests, and the false prophets, and all the people laid hold on him, saying, "Thou shalt surely die!
**9** Because thou hast prophesied in the name of the Lord, saying, 'This house shall be as Shiloh, and this city shall be made desolate, without inhabitants.'"
**10** And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the Lord. And when the princes of Judah heard these words, then they came up from the king's house unto the house of the Lord, and sat down in the entrance of the new gate of the Lord's house.
**11** Then spake the priests and the
