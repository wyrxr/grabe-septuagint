J244 ΙΕΡΕΜΙΑΣ ΚΕΦ. ΙΗ´.
γεῖον, ὃ αὐτὸς ἐποίει ἐκ τοῦ πηλοῦ ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτοῦ· καὶ
πάλιν αὐτὸ ἐποίησεν ἀγγεῖον ἕτερον, καθὼς ἤρεσεν ἐνώπιον αὐ-
τοῦ τοῦ ποιῆσαι. Καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς μέ, λέγων·
6 Εἰ καθὼς ὁ κεραμεὺς οὗτος οὐ δυνήσομαι τοῦ ποιῆσαι ὑμᾶς οἶ-
κος Ἰσραήλ; φησὶ Κύριος· ἰδοὺ ὡς ὁ πηλὸς ἐν χειρὶ τοῦ κε-
ραμέως, οὕτως ὑμεῖς ἐστε ἐν ταῖς χερσί μου. Πέρας λαλήσω
ἐπὶ ἔθνος ἢ ἐπὶ βασιλείαν, τοῦ ἐξᾶραι αὐτούς, καὶ καθελεῖν
8 καὶ τοῦ ἀπολύειν, καὶ ἐπιστρέψῃ τὸ ἔθνος ἐκεῖνο ἀπὸ πάντων
τῶν κακῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ μετανοήσω περὶ πάντων τῶν κακῶν, ὧν
9 ἐλογισάμην, τοῦ ποιῆσαι αὐτοῖς. Καὶ πέρας λαλήσω ἐπὶ ἔθνος
καὶ ἐπὶ βασιλείαν, τοῦ ἀνοικοδομεῖσθαι καὶ τοῦ καταφυτεύεσθαι,
10 καὶ ποιήσουσι τὰ πονηρὰ ἐναντίον μου, τοῦ μὴ ἀκούειν τὴν φω-
νήν μου· καὶ μετανοήσω περὶ τῶν ἀγαθῶν ὧν ἐλάλησα, τοῦ ποιῆ-
11 σαι αὐτοῖς. Καὶ νῦν εἰπὸν πρὸς ἄνδρας Ἰούδα, καὶ πρὸς τοὺς
κατοικοῦντας Ἱερουσαλήμ, λέγων· οὕτως λέγει Κύριος· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ
πλάσσω ἐφ᾽ ὑμᾶς κακά, καὶ λογίζομαι ἐφ᾽ ὑμᾶς λογισμὸν· ἀ-
ποστραφήτω δὴ ἕκαστος ἀπὸ τῆς ὁδοῦ αὐτοῦ τῆς πονηρᾶς, καὶ
καλλίονα ποιήσατε τὰ ἐπιτηδεύματα ὑμῶν, καὶ τὰς ὁδοὺς ὑμῶν.
12 Καὶ εἶπαν· ἀνδριούμεθα, ὅτι ὀπίσω τῶν ἀποστροφῶν ἡμῶν πο-
ρευόμεθα, καὶ ἕκαστος τὰ ἀρεστὰ τῆς καρδίας αὐτοῦ τῆς πο-
13 νηρᾶς ποιήσομεν. Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Κύριος· ἐρωτήσατε δὴ
ἐν ἔθνεσι, τίς ἤκουσε τοιαῦτα φρικτά, ἃ ἐποίησέ μοι σφόδρα παρ-
14 θένος Ἰσραήλ; Μὴ ἐκλείψουσιν ἀπὸ πέτρας μαστοί, ἢ χιὼν ἀπὸ
15 τοῦ Λιβάνου; μὴ ἐκκλίνῃ ὕδωρ βιαίως ἀνέμῳ φερόμενον; Ὅτι
ἐπελάθοντό μου ὁ λαός μου, εἰς κενὸν ἐθυμίασαν, καὶ ἀσθενή-
σουσιν ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὐτῶν σχοίνους αἰωνίους, τοῦ ἐπιβῆναι τρί-
16 βους οὐκ ἔχοντας ὁδὸν πορείας, τοῦ τάξαι τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν εἰς
ἀφανισμόν, καὶ εἰς σύριγμα αἰώνιον· πάντες οἱ παραπορευόμενοι
17 δι᾽ αὐτῆς ἐκστήσονται, καὶ κινήσουσι τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτῶν. Ὡς
ἄνεμον καύσωνα διασπερῶ αὐτοὺς κατὰ πρόσωπον τῶν ἐχθρῶν
18 αὐτῶν, δείξω αὐτοῖς ἡμέραν ἀπωλείας αὐτῶν. Καὶ εἶπαν· δεῦτε
καὶ λογισώμεθα ἐπὶ Ἱερεμίαν λογισμόν, ὅτι οὐκ ἀπολεῖται νόμος
ἀπὸ ἱερέως, καὶ βουλὴ ἀπὸ συνετοῦ, καὶ λόγος ἀπὸ προφήτου·
δεῦτε, καὶ πατάξωμεν αὐτὸν ἐν γλώσσῃ, καὶ οὐκ ἀκουσόμεθα πάν-
19 τας τοὺς λόγους αὐτοῦ. Εἰσάκουσόν μου, Κύριε, καὶ ἐπάκουσον
20 τῆς φωνῆς τοῦ δικαιώματός μου. Εἰ ἀνταποδίδονται ἀντὶ ἀγαθῶν

### JEREMIAH 18

**4** and again he made it another vessel, as seemed good in his sight to make.
**5** And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying:
**6** Shall I not be able to fashion you, O house of Israel, as this potter [doth]? saith the Lord. Behold, as the clay in the potter's hand, so are ye in My hand.
**7** At one moment I may speak concerning a nation or concerning a kingdom, to pluck them up, and to pull them down, and to abolish [them];
**8** and if that nation, concerning whom I have spoken, turn from all their evils, then will I repent concerning all the evils which I purposed to do unto them.
**9** And at another moment I may speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom, to build [them] up and to plant [them];
**10** and if they do evil before Me, so as not to hearken unto My voice, then will I repent concerning the good wherewith I spoke to do unto them.
**11** And now, speak unto the men of Judah, and unto those that dwell in Jerusalem, saying: Thus saith the Lord: Behold, I fashion evils upon you, and I devise a device against you. Turn ye now, each one, from his evil way, and amend ye your doings and your ways.
**12** But they said, 'We shall strengthen ourselves; for after our backslidings do we walk, and each one shall do that which is pleasing to his evil heart.'
**13** Therefore thus saith the Lord: Ask ye now among the nations, who hath heard such dreadful things as the Virgin of Israel hath wrought against Me, [even] most grievously?
**14** Shall the perennial springs from the rock cease? Or the snow from Lebanon? Shall water violently borne by the wind not turn aside?
**15** For My people have forgotten Me, they have burned incense unto vanity; and they shall be weakened in their ways, [even in] their ancient courses, so as to tread paths which have no way of passage;
**16** to set their land for desolation, and for an eternal hissing; all they that pass by it shall be utterly astonished, and shall shake their heads.
**17** As a scorching wind will I scatter them before the face of their enemies; I will show them the day of their destruction.
**18** Then said they, 'Come, and let us devise a plot against Jeremiah; for the Law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the prudent, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and we will not hearken unto all his words.'
**19** Hearken unto me, O Lord, and give ear unto the voice of my plea for justice.
**20** Shall evil be recompensed for good?
