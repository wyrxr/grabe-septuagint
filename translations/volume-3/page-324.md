40 εἰς γενεὰν καὶ γενεάν. Καθὼς κατέστρεφεν ὁ Θεὸς Σόδομα καὶ
   Γόμορρα, καὶ τὰς ὁμορούσας αὐταῖς, εἶπε Κύριος, οὐ μὴ κα-
   τοικήσει ἐκεῖ ἄνθρωπος, καὶ οὐ μὴ παροικήσει ἐκεῖ υἱὸς ἀνθρώ-
41 που. Ἰδοὺ λαὸς ἔρχεται ἀπὸ γῆς Βορρᾶ, καὶ ἔθνος μέγα, καὶ
42 βασιλεῖς πολλοὶ ἐξεγερθήσονται ἀπ᾽ ἐσχάτου τῆς γῆς, τόξον καὶ
   ἐγχειρίδιον ἔχοντες, ἰταμός ἐστι, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἐλέηση· φωνὴ αὐ-
   τῶν ὡς θάλασσα ἠχήσει, ἐφ᾽ ἵπποις ἱππάσσονται παρεσκευα-
   σμένοι, ὥσπερ πῦρ, εἰς πόλεμον· πρὸς σέ, θύγατερ Βαβυλῶνος.
43 Ἤκουσε βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος τὴν ἀκοὴν αὐτῶν, καὶ παρελύθη-
   σαν αἱ χεῖρες αὐτοῦ· θλῖψις κατεκράτησεν αὐτοῦ, ὠδῖνες ὡς τι-
44 κτούσης. Ἰδοὺ ὥσπερ λέων ἀναβήσεται ἀπὸ φρυάγματος τοῦ Ἰορ-
   δάνου εἰς τόπον Αἰθάν, ὅτι ταχέως ἐκδιώξω αὐτοὺς ἀπ᾽ αὐτῆς,
   καὶ πάντα νεανίσκον ἐπ᾽ αὐτὴν ἐπιστήσω· ὅτι τίς ὥσπερ ἐγώ;
   καὶ τίς ἀντιστήσεταί μοι; καὶ τίς οὗτος ποιμήν, ὃς στήσεται
45 κατὰ πρόσωπόν μου; Διὰ τοῦτο ἀκούσατε τὴν βουλὴν Κυρίου,
   ἣν βεβούλευται ἐπὶ Βαβυλῶνα, καὶ διαλογισμοὺς αὐτοῦ, οὓς
   διελογίσατο ἐπὶ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας Χαλδαίους· ἐὰν μὴ διαφθαρῇ
   τὰ ἀρνία τῶν προβάτων αὐτῶν, ἐὰν μὴ ἀφανισθῇ νομή ἀπ᾽ αὐ-
46 τῶν. Ὅτι ἀπὸ φωνῆς ἁλώσεως Βαβυλῶνος σεισθήσεται ἡ γῆ,
   καὶ κραυγὴ ἐν ἔθνεσιν ἀκουσθήσεται.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΗ΄. XXVIII.
(Hebr. LI.)

1 ΤΑΔΕ λέγει Κύριος· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐξεγείρω ἐπὶ Βαβυλῶνα καὶ
   ἐπὶ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας Χαλδαίους ἄνεμον καύσωνα διαφθείροντα·
2 Καὶ ἐξαποστελῶ εἰς Βαβυλῶνα ὑβριστάς, καὶ καθυβρίσουσιν αὐ-
   τήν, καὶ λυμανοῦνται τὴν γῆν αὐτῆς· ὅτι οὐαὶ ἐπὶ Βαβυλῶνα
3 κυκλόθεν ἐν ἡμέρᾳ κακώσεως αὐτῆς. Ἐπ᾽ αὐτῇ τεινέτω ὁ τείνων
   τὸ τόξον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπ᾽ αὐτῇ περιθέσθω, ᾧ ἐστιν ὅπλα αὐτοῦ,
   καὶ μὴ φείσησθε ἐπὶ νεανίσκους αὐτῆς, καὶ ἀφανίσατε πᾶσαν τὴν
4 δύναμιν αὐτῆς. Καὶ πεσοῦνται τραυματίαι ἐν γῇ Χαλδαίων, καὶ
5 κατακεκεντημένοι ἔξωθεν αὐτῆς. Διότι οὐκ ἐχρήσευεν Ἰσραὴλ καὶ
   Ἰούδας ἀπὸ Κυρίου Θεοῦ αὐτῶν, ἀπὸ Κυρίου παντοκράτορος·
   ἔτι ἡ γῆ αὐτῶν ἐπλήσθη ἀδικίας ἀπὸ τῶν ἁγίων Ἰσραήλ.
6 Φεύγετε ἐκ μέσου Βαβυλῶνος, καὶ ἀνασώζετε ἕκαστος τὴν ψυ-

**Jeremiah 27**
(Hebrew Chapter 50)

**40** from generation to generation. As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and those neighboring them, saith the Lord, no man shall dwell there, neither shall any son of man sojourn therein.
**41** Behold, a people cometh from the land of the North, and a great nation, and
**42** many kings shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth. [They shall have] bow and dagger; it is fierce, and it shall not pity. Their voice shall roar like the sea; they ride upon horses, prepared as fire for battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon.
**43** The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands were paralyzed. Anguish hath taken hold of him, [and] pains as of a woman in travail.
**44** Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan unto a strong habitation: for I will swiftly drive them out from it, and I will appoint every young man over her. For who is like Me? And who shall stand against Me? And who is this shepherd that shall stand before My face?
**45** Therefore hear ye the counsel of the Lord, which He hath purposed against Babylon; and His thoughts, which He hath thought against the inhabitants of Chaldea: surely the lambs of their flock shall be destroyed; surely their pasture shall be made desolate from them.
**46** For at the sound of the taking of Babylon the earth shall tremble, and a cry shall be heard among the nations.

**Chapter 28**
(Hebrew Chapter 51)

**1** Thus saith the Lord: Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and against those that dwell in Chaldea, a destroying scorching wind.
**2** And I will send forth unto Babylon despoilers, and they shall utterly despoil her, and they shall waste her land. For woe [is] upon Babylon
**3** round about, in the day of her affliction. Let him that bendeth the bow bend [it] against her; and let him that hath his weapons put them on against her. And spare ye not her young men; and utterly destroy all her host.
**4** And the wounded shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and those pierced through without her.
**5** Because Israel and Judah were not widowed from the Lord their God, from the Lord Almighty; though their land was filled with iniquity from the Holy One of Israel.
**6** Flee ye from the midst of Babylon, and let every man save his own soul; and be ye not cast off in her iniquity:
