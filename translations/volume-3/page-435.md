ΚΕΦ. ΚϚ΄. ΙΕΖΕΚΙΗΛ 1373
καταλύσουσι τὰ τείχη Σὼρ, καὶ καταβαλοῦσι τοὺς πύργους σου, καὶ
λικμήσω τὸν χοῦν αὐτῆς ἀπ᾿ αὐτῆς, καὶ δώσω αὐτὴν εἰς λεωπετρίαν. Ψυγμὸς σαγηνῶν ἔσται ἐν μέσῳ τῆς θαλάσσης, ὅτι ἐγὼ 5
ἐλάλησα, λέγει Κύριος Κύριος· καὶ ἔσται εἰς προνομὴν τοῖς ἔθνεσι,
καὶ αἱ θυγατέρες αὐτῆς αἱ ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ μαχαίρᾳ ἀναιρεθήσονται, 6
καὶ γνώσονται ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι Κύριος. ῞Οτι τάδε λέγει ᾿Αδωναῖ Κύριος· 7
Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐπάγω ἐπὶ σὲ Σὼρ τὸν Ναβουχοδονόσορ (βασιλέα) βασιλέα
Βαβυλῶνος ἀπὸ τοῦ βορρᾶ, βασιλεὺς βασιλέων ἐστὶ, μεθ᾿ ἵππων καὶ
ἁρμάτων καὶ ἱππέων καὶ συναγωγῆς πολλῶν ἐθνῶν σφόδρα. Οὗτος 8
τὰς θυγατέρας σου τὰς ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ μαχαίρᾳ ἀνελεῖ, καὶ δώσει ἐπὶ
σὲ προφυλακὴν, καὶ περιοικοδομήσει, καὶ περιποιήσει ἐπὶ σὲ κύκλῳ
σου χάρακα καὶ περίστασιν ὅπλων, καὶ τὰς λόγχας αὐτοῦ ἀπέναντι
σου δώσει. Τὰ τείχη σου, καὶ τοὺς πύργους σου καταβαλεῖ ἐν ταῖς 9
μαχαίραις αὐτοῦ. ᾿Απὸ τοῦ πλήθους τῶν ἵππων αὐτοῦ καλύψει σε ὁ 10
κονιορτὸς αὐτῶν· ἀπὸ φωνῆς τῶν ἵππων αὐτοῦ καὶ τῶν τροχῶν τῶν
ἁρμάτων αὐτοῦ σεισθήσεται τὰ τείχη σου· εἰσπορευομένου αὐτοῦ τὰς
πύλας σου, ὡς δ᾿ εἰσπορευόμενος εἰς πόλιν ἐκ πεδίου. Ἐν ταῖς ὁπλαῖς 11
τῶν ἵππων αὐτοῦ καταπατήσουσι πάσας τὰς πλατείας σου· τὸν
λαόν σου μαχαίρᾳ ἀνελεῖ· καὶ τὴν ὑπόστασιν τῆς ἰσχύος σου ἐπὶ
τὴν γῆν καταάξει. Καὶ προνομεύσει τὴν δύναμίν σου, καὶ σκυλεύ- 12
σει τὰ ὑπάρχοντά σου, καὶ καταβαλεῖ τὰ τείχη σου, καὶ καθελεῖ
τοὺς οἴκους σου τοὺς ἐπιθυμητοὺς, καὶ τοὺς λίθους σου, καὶ τὰ
ξύλα σου, καὶ τὸν χοῦν σου εἰς μέσον τῆς θαλάσσης ἐμβαλεῖ. Καὶ 13
καταλύσει τὸ πλῆθος τῶν μουσικῶν σου, καὶ ἡ φωνὴ τῶν ψαλτηρίων σου οὐ μὴ ἀκουσθῇ ἐν σοὶ οὐκέτι. Καὶ δώσω σε εἰς λεωπετρίαν, καὶ ψυγμὸς σαγηνῶν ἔσῃ, οὐ μὴ οἰκοδομηθῇς ἔτι, ὅτι ἐγὼ 14
Κύριος ἐλάλησα, λέγει ᾿Αδωναῖ Κύριος. Διότι τάδε λέγει ᾿Αδωναῖ Κύριος Κύριος τῇ Σόρ· οὐχὶ ἀπὸ φωνῆς τῆς πτώσεώς σου ἐν 15
τῷ στενάζαι τραυματίας σου· ἐν τῷ σπάσαι μάχαιραν ἐν μέσῳ
σου, σεισθήσονται αἱ νῆσοι; Καὶ καταβήσονται ἀπὸ τῶν θρόνων 16
αὐτῶν πάντες οἱ ἄρχοντες ἐκ τῶν ἐθνῶν τῆς θαλάσσης, καὶ ἀφελοῦνται τὰς μίτρας ἀπὸ τῶν κεφαλῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ τὸν ἱματισμὸν
τὸν ποικίλον αὐτῶν ἐκδύσονται· καὶ ἐκστάσει ἐκστήσονται, ἐπὶ
τὴν γῆν καθεδοῦνται, καὶ φοβηθήσονται τὴν ἀπώλειαν αὐτῶν, καὶ
στενάζουσιν ἐπὶ σὲ, καὶ λήψονται ἐπὶ σὲ θρῆνον, καὶ ἐροῦσί σοι· 17
πῶς ἀπώλου, καὶ κατελύθης ἐκ θαλάσσης, ἡ πόλις ἡ ἐπαινετή,

**Chapter 26**

**4** And they shall break down thy walls, and cast down thy towers; and I shall winnow her dust from her, and shall make her a bare rock.
**5** A drying-place for nets shall she be in the midst of the sea, for I have spoken it, saith the Lord, the Lord; and she shall become a spoil to the nations.
**6** And her daughters that are in the plain shall be slain by the sword; and they shall know that I am the Lord.
**7** For thus saith Adonai the Lord: "Behold, I bring upon thee, O Tyre, Nebuchadnezzar (the king), the king of Babylon, from the north, a king of kings is he, with horses and chariots and horsemen, and a great multitude of many nations.
**8** He shall slay thy daughters in the plain with the sword, and he shall set a siege-work against thee, and shall build a circumvallation, and make around thee a rampart and a station for weapons; and his spears shall he set against thee.
**9** And he shall cast down thy walls and thy towers with his swords.
**10** From the multitude of his horses shall their dust cover thee; from the sound of his horses and the wheels of his chariots shall thy walls be shaken, when he entereth thy gates, as one entering into a city from the plain.
**11** With the hooves of his horses shall they trample all thy broad ways; he shall slay thy people with the sword, and thy firm foundation of strength shall he bring down to the ground.
**12** And he shall spoil thy wealth, and plunder thy possessions; and he shall cast down thy walls, and pull down thy desirable houses, and thy stones, and thy timbers, and thy dust shall he cast into the midst of the sea.
**13** And he shall cease the multitude of thy music, and the voice of thy psalteries shall no more be heard in thee.
**14** And I shall make thee a bare rock, and thou shalt be a drying-place for nets; thou shalt not be built again, for I the Lord have spoken it," saith Adonai the Lord.
**15** For thus saith Adonai the Lord, the Lord, unto Tyre: "Shall not the islands be shaken at the sound of thy fall, when thy wounded groan in the midst of thee, when the sword is drawn in thy midst?
**16** And all the princes of the nations of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and they shall lay aside their mitres from their heads, and they shall put off their embroidered garments; and they shall be clothed with terror, they shall sit upon the ground, and they shall be terrified by their destruction, and they shall groan over thee, and they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and say unto thee:
**17** 'How art thou destroyed, and brought to ruin from the sea, O laudable city,'
