12 τὰ θυρώματα αὐτῶν, τῶν ἐξεδρῶν τῶν πρὸς νότον· καὶ κατὰ
   τὰ θυρώματα ἀπ᾽ ἀρχῆς τοῦ περιπάτου, ὡς ἐπὶ φῶς διαστή-
   ματος καλάμου, καὶ κατ᾽ ἀνατολάς, τοῦ εἰσπορεύεσθαι δι᾽ αὐτῶν.
13 Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς μέ· αἱ ἐξέδραι αἱ πρὸς βορρᾶν, καὶ αἱ ἐξέδραι αἱ
   πρὸς νότον, αἱ οὖσαι κατὰ πρόσωπον τῶν διαστημάτων, αὗται
   εἰσιν αἱ ἐξέδραι τοῦ ἁγίου, ἐν αἷς φάγονται ἐκεῖ οἱ ἱερεῖς οἱ υἱοὶ
   Σαδδούκ, οἱ ἐγγίζοντες πρὸς Κύριον, τὰ ἅγια τῶν ἁγίων, καὶ
   ἐκεῖ θήσουσι τὰ ἅγια τῶν ἁγίων, καὶ τὴν θυσίαν καὶ τὰ περὶ
14 ἁμαρτίας, καὶ τὰ περὶ ἀγνοίας, διότι ὁ τόπος ἅγιός ἐστιν. Οὐκ
   εἰσελεύσονται ἐκεῖ πάρεξ τῶν ἱερέων, καὶ οὐκ ἐξελεύσονται ἐκ
   τοῦ ἁγίου εἰς τὴν αὐλὴν τὴν ἐξωτέραν, ὅπως διαπαντὸς ἅγιοι
   ὦσιν οἱ προσάγοντες, καὶ μὴ ἅπτωνται τοῦ στολισμοῦ αὐτῶν
   ἐν οἷς λειτουργοῦσιν ἐν αὐτοῖς, διότι ἁγιά ἐστι, καὶ ἐνδύσονται
15 ἱμάτια ἕτερα, ὅταν ἅπτωνται τοῦ λαοῦ. Καὶ συνετελέσθη ἡ
   διαμέτρησις τοῦ οἴκου ἔσωθεν· καὶ ἐξήγαγέ με καθ᾽ ὁδὸν τῆς
   πύλης τῆς βλεπούσης κατ᾽ ἀνατολάς, καὶ διεμέτρησε τὸ ὑπό-
16 δειγμα τοῦ οἴκου κυκλόθεν ἐν διατάξει. Καὶ ἔστη κατὰ νό-
   του τῆς πύλης τῆς βλεπούσης κατ᾽ἀνατολάς, καὶ διεμέτρησε πεν-
17 τακοσίους ἐν τῷ καλάμῳ τοῦ μέτρου. Καὶ ἐπέστρεψε πρὸς βορ-
   ρᾶν, καὶ διεμέτρησε τὸ κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ βορρᾶ πήχεις πεν-
19 τακοσίους ἐν τῷ καλάμῳ τοῦ μέτρου. Καὶ ἐπέστρεψε πρὸς θά-
   λασσαν, καὶ διεμέτρησε τὸ κατὰ πρόσωπον τῆς θαλάσσης, πεν-
18 τακοσίους ἐν τῷ καλάμῳ τοῦ μέτρου. Καὶ ἐπέστρεψε πρὸς νότον,
   καὶ διεμέτρητε κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ νότου, πεντακοσίους ἐν τῷ
20 καλάμῳ τοῦ μέτρου, εἰς τὰ τέσσαρα μέρη τοῦ αὐτοῦ μέτρου· καὶ
   διέταξεν αὐτόν, καὶ περίβολον αὐτῷ κύκλῳ, πεντακοσίων πρὸς
   ἀνατολάς, καὶ πεντακοσίων πήχεων εὖρος, τοῦ διαστέλλειν ἀνα-
   μέσον τῶν ἁγίων, καὶ ἀναμέσον τοῦ προτειχίσματος, τοῦ ἐν
   διατάξει τοῦ οἴκου.

1 ΚΑΙ ἤγαγέ με ἐπὶ τὴν πύλην τὴν βλέπουσαν κατ᾽ ἀνατολάς,

   ὁδὸν τῆς πύλης τῆς βλεπούσης πρὸς ἀνατολάς, καὶ φωνὴ τῆς
   παρεμβολῆς, ὡς φωνὴ διπλασιαζόντων πολλῶν· καὶ ἡ γῆ ἔξ-

**Ezekiel 42**
12 And their doorways, even of the chambers toward the south; and according to the doorways from the beginning of the walk, as unto an opening for light, [even] the space of a reed; and toward the east, for to enter by them.
13 And he spake unto me: The chambers which are toward the north, and the chambers which are toward the south, those which stand over against the dividing spaces, these are the chambers of the Holy [Place], wherein the priests, the sons of Zadok, who draw near unto the Lord, shall there eat the Most Holy Things. And there shall they lay the Most Holy Things, and the sacrifice, and the [offering] for sin, and the [offering] for ignorance; for the place is holy.
14 None shall enter there save the priests; neither shall they go forth from the holy [place] into the outer court, so that those who offer [sacrifices] may ever be holy. And they shall not touch their vestments, in which they minister, for they are holy; but they shall put on other garments, when they approach the people.
15 And the measuring of the house within was completed; and he brought me forth by the way of the gate that looked toward the east, and he measured the perimeter of the house round about in [its due] order.
16 And he stood toward the south of the gate which looked toward the east, and he measured five hundred [cubits] with the measuring reed.
17 And he turned toward the north, and he measured the side toward the north, five hundred cubits with the measuring reed.
18 And he turned toward the sea, and he measured the side toward the sea, five hundred [cubits] with the measuring reed.
19 And he turned toward the south, and he measured the side toward the south, five hundred [cubits] with the measuring reed,
20 unto the four sides of the same measure. And he established it, and an enclosure for it round about, five hundred [cubits] toward the east, and five hundred cubits in breadth, for to separate betwixt the holy [places] and betwixt the outer wall, [which was] in the order of the house.

**Ezekiel 43**
1 Moreover, he brought me unto the gate that looked toward the east,
2 And he led me forth; and lo, the glory of the God of Israel came by the way of the gate that looked toward the east. And [there was] a voice of the multitude, as the voice of many whose voices did reverberate; and the earth did shine forth as a radiant light from the glory of the Lord round about; and the vision
