**ΚΕΦ. ΙΘ΄. XIX.**
**7** βουλὴν Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐν τῷ τόπῳ τούτῳ, καὶ καταβαλῶ αὐτοὺς
ἐν μαχαίρᾳ ἐναντίον τῶν ἐχθρῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐν χερσὶ τῶν ζη-
τούντων τὰς ψυχὰς αὐτῶν· καὶ δώσω τοὺς νεκροὺς αὐτῶν εἰς
βρῶσιν τοῖς πετεινοῖς τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ τοῖς θηρίοις τῆς γῆς,
**8** καὶ τάξω τὴν πόλιν ταύτην εἰς ἀφανισμόν, καὶ εἰς συριγμόν·
πᾶς ὁ παραπορευόμενος ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς σκυθρωπάσει, καὶ συριεῖ ὑπὲρ
**9** πάσης τῆς πληγῆς αὐτῆς. Καὶ ἔδονται τὰς σάρκας τῶν υἱῶν
αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰς σάρκας τῶν θυγατέρων αὐτῶν· καὶ ἕκαστος τὰς
σάρκας τοῦ πλησίον αὐτοῦ ἔδονται ἐν τῇ περιοχῇ, καὶ ἐν πολιορ-
κίᾳ, ᾗ πολιορκήσουσιν αὐτοὺς οἱ ἐχθροὶ αὐτῶν, καὶ οἱ ζητοῦντες
**10** τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτῶν, καὶ συντρίψεις τὸν βικὸν τοῦτον κατ᾿ ὀφθαλ-
**11** μοὺς τῶν ἀνδρῶν τῶν ἐκπορευομένων μετὰ σοῦ, καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς
αὐτούς· τάδε λέγει Κύριος, οὕτως συντρίψω τὸν λαὸν τοῦ-
τον, καὶ τὴν πόλιν ταύτην, καθὼς συντρίβεται ἄγγος ὀστράκι-
**12** νον, ὃ οὐ δυνήσεται ἰαθῆναι ἔτι. Οὕτως ποιήσω τῷ τόπῳ τού-
τῳ, λέγει Κύριος, καὶ τοῖς κατοικοῦσιν ἐν αὐτῷ, τοῦ δοθῆναι
**13** τὴν πόλιν ταύτην, ὡς τὴν διαπίπτουσαν. Καὶ οἶκοι Ἱερουσαλήμ,
καὶ οἶκοι βασιλέων Ἰούδα ἔσονται, καθὼς ὁ τόπος ὁ διαπίπτων
ἀπὸ τῶν ἀκαθαρσιῶν ἐν πάσαις ταῖς οἰκίαις, ἐν αἷς ἐθυμίασαν
ἐπὶ τῶν δωμάτων αὐτῶν πάσῃ τῇ στρατιᾷ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ ἔ-
**14** σπεισαν σπονδὰς θεοῖς ἀλλοτρίοις. Καὶ ἦλθεν Ἱερεμίας ἀπὸ τῆς
διαπτώσεως τοῦ τόπου Τοφεθ, οὗ ἀπέστειλεν αὐτὸν Κύριος ἐκεῖ,
τοῦ προφητεῦσαι· καὶ ἔστη ἐν αὐλῇ οἴκου Κυρίου, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς
**15** πάντα τὸν λαόν. Τάδε λέγει Κύριος τῶν δυνάμεων ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσ-
ραήλ· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐπάγω ἐπὶ τὴν πόλιν ταύτην κακά, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς
πόλεις αὐτῆς πάσας, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς κώμας αὐτῆς, ἅπαντα τὰ κα-
κά, ἃ ἐλάλησα ἐπ᾿ αὐτὴν καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς πόλεις αὐτῆς, ὅτι ἐσκλή-
ρυναν τὸν τράχηλον αὐτῶν, τοῦ μὴ εἰσακούειν τῶν λόγων μου.

**ΚΕΦ. Κ΄. ΧΧ.**

**1** ΚΑΙ ἤκουσε Πασχὼρ υἱὸς Ἐμμὴρ ὁ ἱερεύς, καὶ οὗτος ἦν
καθεσταμένος ἡγούμενος οἴκου Κυρίου τοῦ Ἱερεμίου προφητεύ-
**2** οντος τοὺς λόγους τούτους. Καὶ ἐπάταξε Πασχὼρ τὸν Ἱερε-
μίαν τὸν προφήτην, καὶ ἐνέβαλεν αὐτὸν εἰς τὸν καταράκτην, ὃς
ἦν ἐν πύλῃ οἴκου ἀποτεταγμένου τοῦ ὑπερώου, ὃς ἦν ἐν οἴκῳ

### JEREMIAH 19

**7** ...the counsel of Jerusalem in this place; and I will cast them down by the sword before their enemies, and by the hands of them that seek their lives. And I will give their dead bodies [as] food for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.
**8** And I will make this city desolate, and a hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished, and shall hiss over all her plague.
**9** And they shall eat the flesh of their sons, and the flesh of their daughters; and every one shall eat the flesh of his neighbour in the strait, and in the siege, wherewith their enemies and they that seek their lives shall besiege them.
**10** And thou shalt break this flask before the eyes of the men that go forth with thee,
**11** and thou shalt say unto them, 'Thus saith the Lord: Even so will I break this people and this city, as a potter's vessel is broken,
**12** which cannot be made whole again.' Thus will I do unto this place, saith the Lord, and to them that dwell therein, to the end that this city be given
**13** as one that falleth away. And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, shall be as the place that falleth away from their uncleannesses in all the houses, upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven, and have poured out drink offerings unto alien gods.
**14** Then came Jeremiah from the devastation of the place Topheth, whither the Lord had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of the Lord's house, and said unto all the people:
**15** 'Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring upon this city all the evils, and upon all her cities, and upon her villages, all the evils which I have spoken against her and against her cities, because they have hardened their neck, that they might not hear My words.'

### JEREMIAH 20

**1** NOW Pashhur the son of Immer, the priest, heard [this]; and he was appointed chief governor of the house of the Lord, as Jeremiah prophesied these words.
**2** Then Pashhur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks, which were in the gate of the upper house that was set apart, which was in the house of the Lord.
