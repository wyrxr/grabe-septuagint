19 σομαι ἐπὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ εὐφρανθήσομαι ἐπὶ τῷ λαῷ μου. καὶ
οὐκέτι μὴ ἀκουσθῇ ἐν αὐτῇ φωνὴ κλαυθμοῦ, καὶ φωνὴ κραυγῆς,
20 καὶ οὐ μὴ γένηται ἔτι ἐκεῖ ἄωρος ἡμερῶν καὶ πρεσβύτης, ὃς οὐκ
ἐμπλήσει τὸν χρόνον αὐτοῦ· ἔσται γὰρ ὁ νέος υἱὸς ἑκατὸν ἐτῶν,
ὁ δὲ ἀποθνήσκων ἁμαρτωλὸς υἱὸς ἑκατὸν ἐτῶν, καὶ ἐπικατάρατος
ἔσται.
21 Καὶ οἰκοδομήσουσιν οἰκίας, καὶ αὐτοὶ ἐνοικήσουσι·
καὶ καταφυτεύσουσιν ἀμπελῶνας, καὶ αὐτοὶ φάγονται τὰ γεννή-
22 ματα αὐτῶν· καὶ οὐ μὴ οἰκοδομήσουσι, καὶ ἄλλοι ἐνοικήσουσι,
καὶ οὐ μὴ φυτεύσουσι, καὶ ἄλλοι φάγονται· κατὰ γὰρ τὰς ἡμέ-
ρας τοῦ ξύλου τῆς ζωῆς ἔσονται αἱ ἡμέραι τοῦ λαοῦ μου· τὰ γὰρ
23 ἔργα τῶν πόνων αὐτῶν παλαιώσουσιν, οἱ δὲ ἐκλεκτοί μου οὐ κο-
πιάσουσιν εἰς κενόν, οὐδὲ τεχνοποιήσουσιν εἰς κατάραν, ὅτι σπέρ-
μα εὐλογημένον ὑπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐστι, καὶ τὰ ἔκγονα αὐτῶν μετ᾿
24 αὐτῶν ἔσονται. Καὶ ἔσται πρὶν ἢ κεκράξαι αὐτοὺς, ἐγὼ ἐπακού-
σομαι αὐτῶν, ἔτι λαλούντων αὐτῶν ἐρῶ, τί ἐστι;
25 Τότε λύκοι
καὶ ἄρνες βοσκηθήσονται ἅμα, καὶ λέων ὡς βοῦς φάγεται ἄχυρα,
ὄφις δὲ γῆν ὡς ἄρτον, οὐκ ἀδικήσουσιν, οὐδὲ μὴ λυμανοῦνται
ἐπὶ τῷ ὄρει τῷ ἁγίῳ μου, λέγει Κύριος.

ΚΕΦ. Ξς΄. LXVI.

1 ΟΥΤΩΣ λέγει Κύριος· ὁ οὐρανός μου θρόνος, ἡ δὲ γῆ ὑποπό-
διον τῶν ποδῶν μου· ποῖον οἶκον οἰκοδομήσετέ μοι; καὶ ποῖος
2 τόπος τῆς καταπαύσεώς μου; Πάντα γὰρ ταῦτα ἐποίησεν ἡ χείρ
μου, καὶ ἔστιν ἐμὰ πάντα ταῦτα, λέγει Κύριος· καὶ ἐπὶ τίνα
ἐπιβλέψω, ἀλλ᾿ ἢ ἐπὶ τὸν ταπεινὸν καὶ ἡσύχιον, καὶ τρέμοντα
3 τοὺς λόγους μου; Ὁ δὲ ἄνομος ὁ θύων μοι μόσχον, ὡς ὁ τύπτων
ἄνδρα· καὶ ὁ θυσιάζων ἐκ ποιμνίου, ὡς ὁ ἀποκτενῶν κύνα· ὁ δὲ
ἀναφέρων σεμίδαλιν, ὡς αἷμα ὕειον, ὁ διδοὺς λίβανον εἰς μνη-
μόσυνον, ὡς βλάσφημος· καὶ οὗτοι ἐξελέξαντο τὰς ὁδοὺς αὐτῶν
4 καὶ τὰ βδελύγματα αὐτῶν, ἃ ἡ ψυχὴ αὐτῶν ἠθέλησε. Κἀγὼ
ἐκλέξομαι τὰ ἐμπαίγματα αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰς ἁμαρτίας αὐτῶν ἀν-
ταποδώσω αὐτοῖς· ὅτι ἐκάλεσα αὐτοὺς, καὶ οὐχ ὑπήκουσαν μου.
ἐλάλησα, καὶ οὐκ ἤκουσαν, καὶ ἐποίησαν τὸ πονηρὸν ἐναντίον μου,
5 καὶ ἃ οὐκ ἐβουλόμην ἐξελέξαντο. ᾿Ακούσατε τὸ ῥῆμα Κυρίου οἱ
τρέμοντες τὸν λόγον αὐτοῦ, εἴπατε, ἀδελφοί ὑμῶν, τοῖς μισοῦσιν

#### Chapter 65

**19** ...rejoice over Jerusalem, and I will be glad in My people;
    and no more shall be heard in her the voice of weeping,
    nor the voice of crying.
**20** And there shall no more be there an untimely [one] of days,
    nor an old man that shall not fulfill his time;
    for the youth shall be an hundred years old,
    and he that dieth a sinner,
    though a son of an hundred years, shall be accursed.
**21** And they shall build houses, and they themselves shall dwell therein;
    and they shall plant vineyards, and they themselves shall eat their produce.
**22** They shall not build, and another inhabit;
    they shall not plant, and another eat.
    For according to the days of the tree of life
    shall be the days of My people;
    and the works of their labors shall they wear out.
**23** My chosen shall not toil in vain,
    nor bring forth children for a curse;
    for they are a seed blessed by God,
    and their offspring shall be with them.
**24** And it shall come to pass,
    that before they call, I will answer them;
    and while they are yet speaking, I will say, 'What is it?'
**25** Then the wolf and the lamb shall feed together,
    and the lion shall eat straw like the ox;
    and the serpent, earth as bread.
    They shall not hurt, nor shall they destroy,
    in My holy mountain, saith the Lord.

#### Chapter 66

**1** Thus saith the Lord:
    The heaven is My throne,
    and the earth My footstool.
    What house will ye build for Me?
    And what place for My rest?
**2** For all these things hath My hand made,
    and all these things are Mine, saith the Lord.
    But to whom will I look, save to him
    that is humble and of a quiet spirit,
    and trembleth at My words?
**3** But he that is lawless and sacrificeth a calf unto Me,
    is as he that slayeth a man;
    and he that sacrificeth of the flock,
    as he that killeth a dog;
    he that offereth fine flour, as swine's blood;
    he that giveth frankincense for a memorial,
    as a blasphemer.
    Yea, these have chosen their own ways,
    and their abominations which their soul hath delighted in.
**4** I also will choose their delusions,
    and recompense their sins upon them;
    because I called them, and they hearkened not;
    I spoke, and they heard not;
    but they wrought evil before Me,
    and chose that which I desired not.
**5** Hearken unto the word of the Lord,
    ye that tremble at His word.
    Say ye unto your brethren,
    to those that hate you and abhor you:
    'Let this [matter] be manifest in their joy,
    and they shall be put to shame.'
