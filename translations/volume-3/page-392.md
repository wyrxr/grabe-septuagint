ΚΕΦ. Β΄.
1 ΚΑΙ εἶπε πρὸς μέ· υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, στῆθι ἐπὶ τοὺς πόδας σου,
2 καὶ λαλήσω πρὸς σέ. Καὶ ἦλθεν ἐπ᾿ ἐμὲ πνεῦμα, καὶ ἀνέλαβέ
    με, καὶ ἐξήγειρέ με, καὶ ἔστησέ με ἐπὶ τοὺς πόδας μου, καὶ
3 ἤκουον αὐτοῦ λαλοῦντος πρὸς μέ, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς μέ· υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου,
    ἐξαποστελῶ ἐγώ σε πρὸς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ ᾿Ισραήλ, τοὺς παραπικραίνοντάς
    με, οἵ τινες παρεπίκραναν με, αὐτοὶ καὶ οἱ πατέρες
4 αὐτῶν ἠθέτησαν ἐν ἐμοί, ἕως τῆς σήμερον ἡμέρας. Καὶ υἱοὶ σκληροπρόσωποι
    καὶ στερεοκάρδιοι· ἐγὼ ἀποστέλλω σε πρὸς αὐτούς.
5 Καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτούς· τάδε λέγει Κύριος Κύριος. ᾿Εὰν ἄρα ἀκούσωσιν
    ἢ πτοηθῶσι, διότι οἶκος παραπικραίνων ἐστί, καὶ γνώσονται
    ὅτι προφήτης εἶ σὺ ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῶν.
6 Καὶ σὺ υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, μὴ φοβηθῇς αὐτούς, μηδὲ ἐκστῇς ἀπὸ
    προσώπου αὐτῶν· διότι παριστρήσουσι, καὶ ἐπισυστήσονται ἐπὶ
    σὲ κύκλῳ, καὶ ἐν μέσῳ σκορπίων σὺ κατοικεῖς· τοὺς λόγους
    αὐτῶν μὴ φοβηθῇς, καὶ ἀπὸ
7 προσώπου αὐτῶν μὴ ἐκστῇς, διότι οἶκος παραπικραίνων ἐστί. Καὶ
    λαλήσεις τοὺς λόγους μου πρὸς αὐτούς, ἐὰν ἄρα ἀκούσωσιν ἢ
    πτοηθῶσι, διότι οἶκος παραπικραίνων ἐστί.
8 Καὶ σὺ υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, ἄκουε τοῦ λαλοῦντος πρὸς σέ, μὴ γίνου
    παραπικραίνων καὶ σύ, καθὼς ὁ οἶκος ὁ παραπικραίνων· χάνε
    τὸ στόμα σου, καὶ φάγε
9 ἃ ἐγὼ δίδωμί σοι. Καὶ ἴδον, καὶ ἰδοὺ χεὶρ ἐκτεταμένη πρὸς μέ,
10 καὶ ἐν αὐτῇ κεφαλὶς βιβλίου. Καὶ ἀνείλησεν αὐτὴν ἐνώπιον ἐμοῦ,
    καὶ ἐν αὐτῇ γεγραμμένα ἦν τὰ ὄπισθεν καὶ τὰ ἔμπροσθεν· καὶ
    ἐγέγραπτο εἰς αὐτὴν θρῆνος καὶ μέλος καὶ οὐαί.

ΚΕΦ. Γ΄.
1 ΚΑΙ εἶπε πρὸς μέ· υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, κατάφαγε τὴν κεφαλῖδα
    ταύτην,
2 καὶ πορεύθητι καὶ λάλησον τοῖς υἱοῖς ᾿Ισραήλ. Καὶ διήνοιξε
    τὸ στόμα μου, καὶ ἐψώμισέ με τὴν κεφαλῖδα ταύτην.
3 Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς μέ· υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, τὸ στόμα σου φάγεται, καὶ ἡ κοιλία
    σου πλησθήσεται τῆς κεφαλίδος ταύτης τῆς δεδομένης εἰς σέ·
    καὶ ἔφαγον αὐτήν, καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ στόματί μου, ὡς μέλι γλυκάζον.
4 Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς μέ· υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, βάδιζε, εἴσελθε πρὸς

### Chapter 2

**1** And He said unto me, “Son of man, stand upon thy feet,
**2** and I shall speak unto thee.” And the Spirit came upon me, and took me up, and raised me, and set me upon my feet; and
**3** I heard Him speaking unto me. And He said unto me, “Son of man, I shall send thee unto the house of Israel, unto those who embitter Me, for they have embittered Me, both they and their fathers
**4** have rebelled against Me, even unto this very day. And [they are] children of a hard countenance and stiff-hearted: I send thee unto them.
**5** And thou shalt say unto them, ‘Thus saith the Lord God.’ If then they hear, or if they be affrighted, because it is a house that embittereth [Me], yet shall they know that thou art a prophet in their midst.
**6** And thou, Son of man, fear them not, neither be dismayed by their countenances; for they shall be perverse, and shall gather against thee in a circle, and in the midst of scorpions shalt thou dwell. Fear not their words, nor
**7** be dismayed by their countenances, because it is a house that embittereth [Me]. And thou shalt speak My words unto them, if then they hear or if they be affrighted, because it is a house that embittereth [Me].
**8** And thou, Son of man, hearken unto Him that speaketh unto thee: be not thou also an embitterer, like unto the house that embittereth [Me]; open wide thy mouth, and eat
**9** that which I give unto thee.” And I beheld, and lo, a hand was stretched forth unto me,
**10** and in it was a scroll of a book. And He unrolled it before me; and written therein were the back and the front; and there was written therein lamentation, and mourning, and woe.

### Chapter 3

**1** And He said unto me, “Son of man, devour this scroll,
**2** and go, and speak unto the sons of Israel.” And He opened my mouth, and He fed me this scroll.
**3** And He said unto me, “Son of man, thy mouth shall eat, and thy belly shall be filled with this scroll that is given unto thee.” And I ate it, and it was in my mouth as honey, sweet [to the taste].
**4** And He said unto me, “Son of man, go thy way, enter unto
