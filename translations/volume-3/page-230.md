ὀνοκένταυροι οἰκήσουσιν ἐν αὐτῇ. Οἱ ἄρχοντες αὐτῆς οὐκ ἔσονται. οἱ γὰρ βασιλεῖς αὐτῆς, καὶ πάντες οἱ ἄρχοντες αὐτῆς,
καὶ οἱ μεγιστάνες αὐτῆς ἔσονται εἰς ἀπώλειαν. Καὶ ἀναφύσει
εἰς τὰς πόλεις αὐτῶν ἄκανθα, καὶ μνῖδες καὶ ἄκανοι εἰς τὰ
ὀχυρώματα αὐτῆς∙ καὶ ἔσται ἐπαύλεις σειρήνων, καὶ αὐλὴ σρουθῶν. Καὶ συναντήσουσι δαιμόνια ὀνοκενταύροις, καὶ βοήσονται
ἕτερος πρὸς τὸν ἕτερον, ἐκεῖ ἀναπαύσονται ὀνοκένταυροι, εὗρον
γὰρ αὐτοῖς ἀνάπαυσιν. Ἐκεῖ ἐνόσσευσεν ἐχῖνος, καὶ ἔσωσεν ἡ
γῆ τὰ παιδία αὐτῆς μετὰ ἀσφαλείας∙ ἐκεῖ ἔλαφοι συνήντησαν,
καὶ ἴδον τὰ πρόσωπα ἀλλήλων. Ἀριθμῷ παρῆλθον, καὶ μία
αὐτῶν οὐκ ἀπώλετο, ἑτέρα τὴν ἑτέραν οὐκ ἐξεζήτησαν, ὅτι
Κύριος ἐνετείλατο αὐτοῖς, καὶ τὸ πνεῦμα αὐτοῦ συνήγαγεν αὐτά.
Καὶ αὐτὸς ἐπιβαλεῖ αὐτοῖς κλήρους, καὶ ἡ χεὶρ αὐτοῦ διεμέρισε
βόσκεσθαι∙ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα κληρονομήσετε, εἰς γενεὰς γενεῶν ἀναπαύσονται ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς.

KΕΦ. ΛΕ΄.XXXV.

ΕΥΦΡΑΝΘΗΤΙ ἔρημος ἡ διψῶσα, ἀγαλλιάσθω ἔρημος, καὶ
ἀνθείτω ὡς κρίνον, καὶ ἐξανθήσει καὶ ὑλογαρήσει καὶ ἀγαλλιάσεται τὰ ἔρημα τοῦ Ἰορδάνου∙ καὶ ἡ δόξα τοῦ Λιβάνου ἐδόθη
αὐτῇ, καὶ ἡ τιμὴ τοῦ Καρμήλου, καὶ ὁ λαός μου ὄψεται τὴν
δόξαν Κυρίου, καὶ τὸ ὕψος τοῦ Θεοῦ. Ἰσχύσατε χεῖρες ἀνειμέναι,
καὶ γόνατα παραλελυμένα, περικαλέσατε, εἴπατε τοῖς ὀλιγοψύχοις τῇ διανοίᾳ∙ ἰσχύσατε, μὴ φοβῆσθε∙ ἰδοὺ ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν
κρίσιν ἀνταποδίδωσι, καὶ ἀνταποδώσει, αὐτὸς ἥξει, καὶ σώσει ἡμᾶς. Τότε ἀνοιγήσονται ὀφθαλμοὶ τυφλῶν, καὶ ὦτα
κωφῶν ἀκούσονται. Τότε ἁλεῖται ὡς ἔλαφος ὁ χωλός,
καὶ τρανὴ ἔσται γλῶσσα μογιλάλων, ὅτι ἐῤῥάγη ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ ὕδωρ, καὶ φάραγξ ἐν γῇ διψώσῃ, καὶ ἡ ἄνυδρος ἔσται
εἰς ἔλη, καὶ εἰς τὴν διψῶσαν γῆν πηγὴ ὕδατος∙ ἐκεῖ εὐφροσύνη ὀρνέων, ἐπαύλεις καλάμου καὶ ἕλη. Ἐκεῖ ἔσται ὁδὸς
καθαρά, καὶ ὁδὸς ἁγία κληθήσεται, καὶ οὐ μὴ παρέλθῃ ἐκεῖ
ἀκάθαρτος, οὐδὲ ἐκεῖ ἔσται ὁδὸς ἀκάθαρτος∙ οἱ δὲ διεσπαρμένοι πορεύσονται ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς, καὶ οὐ μὴ πλανηθῶσι. Καὶ
οὐκ ἔσται ἐκεῖ λέων, οὐδὲ τῶν θηρίων τῶν πονηρῶν οὐ μὴ

**Chapter 34**
**11** Onocentaurs shall dwell therein. Her rulers shall be no more; for her kings, and all her rulers, and her magnates shall be given unto perdition. And thorns shall spring up in her cities, and gnats and thistles in her strongholds; and it shall be habitations of sirens, and a court of ostriches.
**12** And demons shall meet with onocentaurs, and they shall cry out one to another. There shall onocentaurs find rest, for they have found for themselves a resting place.
**13** There the hedgehog hath nested, and the earth hath preserved her children in safety.
**14** There the deer did meet, and beheld one another's faces. In number did they pass through, and not one of them perished, neither did one seek another; for the Lord hath commanded them, and His Spirit hath gathered them.
**15** And He Himself shall cast lots for them, and His hand hath divided [it] for pasture. For ever shall ye inherit, unto generations of generations shall they rest upon it.

**Chapter 35**
**1** Let the thirsty wilderness be glad; let the desert rejoice and blossom as a lily. Yea, it shall blossom forth and bring forth verdure, and the deserts of Jordan shall exult.
**2** And the glory of Lebanon hath been given unto it, and the honour of Carmel. And My people shall behold the glory of the Lord, and the majesty of God.
**3** Strengthen ye, O ye hands that are loosened, and ye knees that are palsied! Take courage, say unto the faint-hearted in spirit: 'Be strong, fear ye not! Behold, our God doth render judgment, and He shall render recompense; He Himself shall come, and shall save us.'
**4** Then shall the eyes of the blind be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall hear.
**5** Then shall the lame man leap as a deer, and clear shall be the tongue of them that stammer. For water hath burst forth in the wilderness, and a ravine in the thirsty land; and the parched land shall become pools, and in the thirsty ground a spring of water.
**6** There shall be the rejoicing of birds, [even] habitations of reeds and pools. There shall be a clean way, and it shall be called a holy way.
**7** And no unclean [person] shall pass thereby, nor shall there be an unclean way there. But the scattered ones shall walk upon it, and they shall not go astray.
**8** And no lion shall be there, nor of the evil beasts shall any not...
