**Ω Σ Η Ε**
**ΚΕΦ. Β΄.**

**1** Εἴπατε τῷ ἀδελφῷ ὑμῶν, λαός μου, καὶ τῇ ἀδελφῇ ὑμῶν,
**2** ἠλεημένη· κρίθητε πρὸς τὴν μητέρα ὑμῶν, κρίθητε, ὅτι αὕτη οὐ
γυνή μου, καὶ ἐγὼ οὐκ ἀνὴρ αὐτῆς. Καὶ ἐξαρῶ τὴν πορνείαν αὐ-
τῆς ἐκ προσώπου μου, καὶ τὴν μοιχείαν αὐτῆς ἐκ μέσου μαστῶν
**3** αὐτῆς, ὅπως ἂν ἐκδύσω αὐτὴν γυμνήν, καὶ ἀποκαταστήσω αὐτήν,
καθὼς ἡμέρᾳ γενέσεως αὐτῆς· καὶ θήσω αὐτὴν ὡς ἔρημον, καὶ
**4** τάξω αὐτὴν ὡς γῆν ἄνυδρον, καὶ ἀποκτενῶ αὐτὴν ἐν δίψει. Καὶ
**5** τὰ τέκνα αὐτῆς οὐ μὴ ἐλεήσω, ὅτι τέκνα πορνείας ἐστίν. Ὅτι
ἐξεπόρνευσεν ἡ μήτηρ αὐτῶν, κατήσχυνεν ἡ τεκοῦσα αὐτά· εἶπε
γάρ, πορεύσομαι ὀπίσω τῶν ἐραστῶν μου, τῶν διδόντων μοι
τοὺς ἄρτους μου, καὶ τὸ ὕδωρ μου, καὶ τὰ ἱμάτιά μου, καὶ
τὰ ἐθόνιά μου, καὶ τὸ ἔλαιόν μου, καὶ πάντα ὅσα μοι κα-
**6** θήκει. Διὰ τοῦτο ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ φράσσω τὴν ὁδὸν αὐτῆς ἐν σκό-
λοπι, καὶ ἀνοικοδομήσω τὰς ὁδοὺς αὐτῆς, καὶ τὴν τρίβον αὐτῆς
**7** οὐ μὴ εὕρῃ· καὶ καταδιώξεται τοὺς ἐραστὰς αὐτῆς, καὶ οὐ μὴ κα-
ταλάβῃ αὐτούς, καὶ ζητήσει αὐτούς, καὶ οὐ μὴ εὕρῃ αὐτούς. Καὶ
ἐρεῖ· πορεύσομαι, καὶ ἐπιστρέψω πρὸς τὸν ἄνδρα μου τὸν πρότερον,
**8** ὅτι καλῶς μοι ἦν τότε, ἢ νῦν· καὶ αὕτη οὐκ ἔγνω, ὅτι ἐγὼ δέ-
δωκα αὐτῇ τὸν σῖτον καὶ τὸν οἶνον καὶ τὸ ἔλαιον, καὶ ἀργύριον
**9** ἐπλήθυνα αὐτῇ· αὕτη δὲ ἀργυρᾶ καὶ χρυσᾶ ἐποίησε τῇ Βάαλ. Διὰ
τοῦτο ἐπιστρέψω, καὶ κομιοῦμαι τὸν σῖτόν μου καθ᾿ ὥραν αὐτοῦ,
καὶ τὸν οἶνόν μου ἐν καιρῷ αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἀφελοῦμαι τὰ ἱμάτιά μου
**10** καὶ τὰ ἐθόνιά μου, τοῦ μὴ καλύπτειν τὴν ἀσχημοσύνην αὐτῆς· καὶ
νῦν ἀποκαλύψω τὴν ἀκαθαρσίαν αὐτῆς ἐναντίον τῶν ἐραστῶν αὐ-
**11** τῆς, καὶ οὐδεὶς οὐ μὴ ἐξέλῃται αὐτὴν ἐκ χειρός μου. Καὶ ἀπο-
στρέψω πάσας τὰς εὐφροσύνας αὐτῆς, τὰς ἑορτὰς αὐτῆς, καὶ τὰς
νουμεηνίας αὐτῆς, καὶ τὰ σάββατα αὐτῆς, καὶ πάσας τὰς πανη-
**12** γύρεις αὐτῆς. Καὶ ἀφανιῶ ἄμπελον αὐτῆς, καὶ τὰς συκᾶς αὐτῆς,
ὅσα εἶπε· μισθώματά μου ταῦτά ἐστιν, ἃ ἔδωκάν μοι οἱ ἐρασταί
μου· καὶ θήσομαι αὐτὰ εἰς μαρτύριον, καὶ καταφάγεται αὐτὰ τὰ
θηρία τοῦ ἀγροῦ, καὶ τὰ πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ τὰ ἑρπετὰ
**13** τῆς γῆς. Καὶ ἐκδικήσω ἐπ᾿ αὐτὴν τὰς ἡμέρας τῶν Βααλείμ, ἐν
αἷς ἐπέθυεν αὐτοῖς, καὶ περιετίθετο τὰ ἐνώτια αὐτῆς καὶ τὰ κα-
θόρμια αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐπορεύετο ὀπίσω τῶν ἐραστῶν αὐτῆς, ἐμοῦ δὲ

**HOSEA**
**CHAPTER 2**

**1** Say ye unto your brother, My People, and to your sister, Pitied;
**2** Plead ye with your mother, plead ye; for she is not My wife, neither am I her husband. And I will take away her harlotry from before My face, and her adultery from between her breasts,
**3** Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day of her birth; and I will make her as a wilderness, and set her as a land without water, and slay her with thirst.
**4** And her children I will not pity, for they are children of harlotries.
**5** For their mother hath played the harlot; she that bare them hath brought shame. For she said, "I will go after my lovers, who give me my bread, and my water, and my garments, and my flaxen raiment, and my oil, and all that is needful for me."
**6** Therefore, behold, I will hedge up her way with thorns, and I will build up her paths, so that she shall not find her track.
**7** And she shall pursue her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but she shall not find them. Then shall she say, "I will go and return to my former husband; for it was better with me then than now."
**8** For she knew not that I had given her the corn, and the wine, and the oil, and had multiplied silver unto her; yet she fashioned [idols] of silver and gold for Baal.
**9** Therefore will I return, and take away My corn in its season, and My wine in its time; and I will take away My garments and My flaxen raiment, that they should not cover her shame.
**10** And now will I uncover her uncleanness before the eyes of her lovers, and no man shall deliver her out of My hand.
**11** And I will turn away all her joy, her feasts, and her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn assemblies.
**12** And I will lay waste her vine, and her fig trees, of which she said, "These are my hire, which my lovers have given me." And I will make them for a testimony [of desolation], and the beasts of the field shall devour them, and the birds of the air, and the creeping things of the earth.
**13** And I will avenge upon her the days of the Baalim, wherein she burned incense unto them, and decked herself with her earrings and her ornaments, and went after her lovers, but forgat Me, saith the LORD.
