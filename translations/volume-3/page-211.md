ΤΟΥ ἔτους οὗ εἰσῆλθε Ταρθὰν εἰς Ἄζωτον, ἡνίκα ἀπεστάλη 1
ὑπὸ Ἀρνὰ βασιλέως Ἀσσυρίων, καὶ ἐπολέμησε τὴν Ἄζωτον, καὶ
κατελάβετο αὐτήν, τότε ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Ἠσαΐαν υἱὸν Ἀμώς, 2
λέγων· πορεύου, καὶ ἄφελε τὸν σάκκον ἀπὸ τῆς ὀσφύος σου, καὶ
τὰ σανδάλιά σου ὑπόλυσαι ἀπὸ τῶν ποδῶν σου, καὶ ποίησον οὕτως,
πορευόμενος γυμνὸς καὶ ἀνυπόδητος. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος· ὃν τρόπον 3
πεπόρευται Ἠσαΐας ὁ παῖς μου γυμνὸς καὶ ἀνυπόδητος· τρία ἔτη
ἔσται σημεῖα καὶ τέρατα τοῖς Αἰγυπτίοις καὶ Αἰθίοψιν, ὅτι οὕτως 4
ἄξει βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν Αἰγύπτου καὶ Αἰθιόπων,
νεανίσκους καὶ πρεσβύτας, γυμνοὺς καὶ ἀνυποδέτους, ἀνακεκαλυμμένους τὴν αἰσχύνην Αἰγύπτου. Καὶ αἰσχυνθήσονται ἡττηθέντες 5
οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι ἐπὶ τοῖς Αἰθίοψιν, ἐφ᾿ οἷς ἦσαν πεποιθότες οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι, ἦσαν γὰρ αὐτοῖς δόξα. Καὶ ἐροῦσιν οἱ κατοικοῦντες ἐν τῇ 6
νήσῳ ταύτῃ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ· ἰδοὺ ἡμεῖς ἦμεν πεποιθότες τοῦ
φυγεῖν εἰς αὐτοὺς εἰς βοήθειαν, οἳ οὐκ ἠδύναντο σωθῆναι ἀπὸ βα-
σιλέως Ἀσσυρίων, καὶ πῶς ἡμεῖς σωθησόμεθα;

ΤΟ ΟΡΑΜΑ ΤΗΣ ΕΡΗΜΟΥ. Ὡς καταιγὶς δι᾿ ἐρήμου 1
διέλθοι, ἐξ ἐρήμου ἐρχομένη ἐκ γῆς, φοβερὸν τὸ ὅραμα, καὶ σκληρὸν 2
ἀγγέλη μοι· ὃ ἀθετῶν ἀθετεῖ, ὁ ἀνομῶν ἀνομεῖ· ἐπ᾿ ἐμοὶ οἱ Ἐλαμῖται, καὶ οἱ πρέσβεις τῶν Περσῶν ἐπ᾿ ἐμὲ ἔρχονται· νῦν στενάζω καὶ παρακαλέσω ἐμαυτόν. Διὰ τοῦτο ἐνεπλήσθη ἡ ὀσφύς μου 3
ἐκλύσεως, καὶ ὠδῖνες ἔλαβόν με ὡς τὴν τίκτουσαν· ἠδίκησα τοῦ
μὴ ἀκοῦσαι, ἐσπούδασα τοῦ μὴ βλέπειν. Ἡ καρδία μου πλανᾶται, 4
καὶ ἡ ἀνομία με βαπτίζει, ἡ ψυχή μου ἐφέστηκεν εἰς φόβον. Ἕ- 5
τοίμασον τὴν τράπεζαν, σκόπευσον τὴν σκοπιάν· φάγετε, πίετε·
ἀναστάντες οἱ ἄρχοντες, ἑτοιμάσατε θυρεούς, ὅτι οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος 6
πρός με· βάδισας σεαυτῷ στῆσον σκοπόν, καὶ ὃ ἐὰν ἴδῃς, ἀνάγγειλον. Καὶ ἰδὼν ἀναβάτας ἱππεῖς δύο, ἀναβάτην ὄνου, καὶ ἀναβάτην 7

**Chapter 19** (conclusion)
**25** ...blessed *be* My people, which *is* in Egypt, and the work of My hands among the Assyrians, and My inheritance, Israel.

**Chapter 20**
**1** In the year when Tartan came unto Ashdod, at the time when he was sent by Arna, king of Assyria, and he waged war against Ashdod, and took it:
**2** Then spake the Lord unto Isaiah, the son of Amoz, saying, "Go, and take off the sackcloth from thy loins, and loose thy sandals from off thy feet; and do so, walking naked and unshod."
**3** And the Lord said, "Even as My servant Isaiah hath walked naked and unshod, *so* for three years shall it be for a sign and a wonder unto the Egyptians and unto the Ethiopians;
**4** for in this manner shall the king of Assyria lead away the captives of Egypt and of Ethiopia, both young men and old, naked and unshod, with the shame of Egypt uncovered."
**5** And the Egyptians shall be ashamed, being defeated, because of the Ethiopians, in whom the Egyptians had trusted; for they were their glory.
**6** And they that dwell in this isle shall say in that day, "Behold, we had trusted to flee unto them for succour, *even* they who could not save themselves from the king of Assyria; and how then shall we be saved?"

**Chapter 21**
**1** THE VISION OF THE DESERT.
As a whirlwind that passeth through the desert, coming forth from the desert, from the land,
**2** fearsome is the vision, and harsh *is that* which is announced unto me: "He that dealeth treacherously doth deal treacherously, and he that doeth lawlessly doth act lawlessly. Against me *come* the Elamites, and the ambassadors of the Persians come against me." Now I groan and shall comfort myself.
**3** Therefore is my loins filled with weakness, and pangs have seized me as a woman in travail. I was too weak to hear, and I hastened not to see.
**4** My heart doth stray, and lawlessness doth overwhelm me; my soul hath been set in fear.
**5** "Prepare ye the table, set the watch; eat ye, drink ye. Arise, ye princes, prepare the shields,"
**6** for thus hath the Lord said unto me: "Go, set for thyself a watchman; and whatsoever thou shalt see, declare it."
**7** And he saw riders, two horsemen, a rider on an ass, and a rider on a camel.
