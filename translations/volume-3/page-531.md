καὶ τὸ ἔρημα αὐτοῦ ἐφύλαξεν εἰς νῖκος· καὶ ἐξαποστελῶ πῦρ 12
εἰς Θαιμάν, καὶ καταφάγεται θεμέλια τειχέων αὐτῆς. Τάδε λέ- 13
γει Κύριος· ἐπὶ ταῖς τρισὶν ἀσεβείαις υἱῶν Ἀμμὼν καὶ ἐπὶ ταῖς
τέσσαρσιν οὐκ ἀποστραφήσομαι αὐτούς, ἀνθ᾽ ὧν ἀνέσχιζον τὰς
ἐν γαστρὶ ἐχούσας τῶν Γαλααδιτῶν, ὅπως ἐμπλατύνωσι τὰ

ΚΕΦ. Β΄. ΙΙ.

Τάδε λέγει Κύριος· ἐπὶ ταῖς τρισὶν ἀσεβείαις Μωὰβ καὶ 1
ἐπὶ ταῖς τέσσαρσιν οὐκ ἀποστραφήσομαι αὐτόν, ἀνθ᾽ ὧν κατέκαυ-
σαν τὰ ὀστᾶ βασιλέως τῆς Ἰδουμαίας εἰς κονίαν· καὶ ἐξαποστε- 2
λῶ πῦρ εἰς Μωάβ, καὶ καταφάγεται θεμέλια τῶν πόλεων αὐτῆς,
καὶ ἀποθανεῖται ἐν ἀδυναμίᾳ Μωὰβ μετὰ κραυγῆς καὶ μετὰ φω-
νῆς σάλπιγγος· καὶ ἐξολεθρεύσω κριτὴν ἐξ αὐτῆς, καὶ πάντας τοὺς 3
ἄρχοντας αὐτῆς ἀποκτενῶ μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ, λέγει Κύριος. Τάδε λέγει 4
Κύριος· ἐπὶ ταῖς τρισὶν ἀσεβείαις υἱῶν Ἰούδα καὶ ἐπὶ ταῖς τέσσαρ-
σιν οὐκ ἀποστραφήσομαι αὐτόν, ἕνεκεν τοῦ ἀπώσασθαι αὐτοὺς
τὸν νόμον Κυρίου, καὶ τὰ προστάγματα αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἐφυλάξαντο, καὶ
ἐπλάνησεν αὐτοὺς τὰ μάταια αὐτῶν ἃ ἐποίησαν, οἷς ἐξηκολούθη-
σαν οἱ πατέρες αὐτῶν ὀπίσω αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐξαποστελῶ πῦρ ἐπὶ 5
Ἰούδαν, καὶ καταφάγεται θεμέλια Ἱερουσαλήμ. Τάδε λέγει Κύ- 6
ριος· ἐπὶ ταῖς τρισὶν ἀσεβείαις Ἰσραὴλ καὶ ἐπὶ ταῖς τέσσαρσιν
οὐκ ἀποστραφήσομαι αὐτόν, ἀνθ᾽ ὧν ἀπέδοντο ἀργυρίου δίκαιον,
καὶ πένητα ἕνεκεν ὑποδημάτων, τῶν πατούντων ἐπὶ τὸν χοῦν 7
τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἐκονδύλιζον εἰς κεφαλὰς πτωχῶν, καὶ ὁδὸν ταπει-

αὐτὴν παιδίσκην, ὅπως βεβηλωθῶσι τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ Θεοῦ αὐτῶν·
καὶ τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτῶν δεσμεύοντες σχοινίοις, παραπετάσματα ἐποί- 8

**CHAPTER 1**

**11** ...and he preserved his wilderness for a triumph.
**12** And I will send a fire into Teman, and it shall devour the foundations of her walls.
**13** Thus saith the Lord: "For three transgressions of the sons of Ammon, and for four, I will not turn away from them; because they did rip open the pregnant women of the Gileadites, that they might enlarge their borders.
**14** And I will kindle a fire upon the walls of Rabbah, and it shall devour her foundations with a cry in the day of battle; and she shall be shaken in the day of her consummation.
**15** And her kings shall go into captivity, their priests and their princes together," saith the Lord.

**CHAPTER 2**

**1** Thus saith the Lord: "For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not turn away from him; because they did burn the bones of the king of Idumaea into ashes.
**2** And I will send a fire into Moab, and it shall devour the foundations of her cities; and Moab shall die in weakness with a cry and with the sound of a trumpet.
**3** And I will utterly destroy the judge from her, and all her princes will I slay with him," saith the Lord.
**4** Thus saith the Lord: "For three transgressions of the sons of Judah, and for four, I will not turn away from him; because they rejected the law of the Lord, and kept not His ordinances; and their vanities, which they made, did lead them astray, after which their fathers followed.
**5** And I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the foundations of Jerusalem."
**6** Thus saith the Lord: "For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away from him; because they sold for silver the righteous, and the poor for a pair of shoes;
**7** Who trampled upon the dust of the earth, and did smite the heads of the poor, and turned aside the way of the humble. And a son and his father went in unto the same maid, that they might profane the name of their God.
**8** And their garments, binding them with ropes, they made into hangings, held next to the altar; and wine from slanders they drank in the house of their God."
**9** "But I did destroy the Amorite from before them, whose height was as the height of the cedar, and he was strong as an oak; and I dried up his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.
