σου τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ ὄψονται, καὶ στόμα αὐτοῦ μετὰ τοῦ
4 στόματός σου λαλήσει, καὶ εἰς Βαβυλῶνα εἰσελεύσῃ. Ἀλλὰ ἄκουε
πρὸς τοῦτον τὸν λόγον Κυρίου, Σεδεκία βασιλεῦ Ἰούδα· οὕτως λέγει
5 Κύριος περὶ σοῦ· οὐκ ἀποθανῇ ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ, ἐν εἰρήνῃ ἀποθανῇ·
καὶ ὡς καύσουσί καὶ σέ, ὦ Κύριε, καὶ ὦ Ἄδων, κλαύσονται σε,
6 ὅτι λόγον ἐγὼ ἐλάλησα εἶπε Κύριος. Καὶ ἐλάλησεν Ἱερεμίας ὁ
προφήτης πρὸς βασιλέα Ἰούδα Σεδεκίαν πάντας τοὺς λόγους τού-
7 τους ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ ἡ δύναμις βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος ἐπο-
λέμει ἐπὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς πόλεις Ἰούδα τὰς κατα-
λελειμμένας, ἐπὶ Λαχείς, καὶ ἐπὶ Ἄζηκα, ὅτι αὗται κατελεί-
8 φθησαν ἐν πόλεσιν Ἰούδα πόλεις ὀχυραί. Ὁ λόγος ὁ γενόμενος
πρὸς Ἱερεμίαν παρὰ Κυρίου, μετὰ τὸ συντελέσαι τὸν βασιλέα
Σεδεκίαν διαθήκην πρὸς πάντα τὸν λαὸν τὸν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ,
9 τοῦ καλέσαι αὐτοῖς ἄφεσιν, τοῦ ἐξαποστεῖλαι ἕκαστον τὸν παῖδα
αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἕκαστον τὴν παιδίσκην αὐτοῦ, τὸν Ἑβραῖον καὶ
τὴν Ἑβραίαν ἐλευθέρους, πρὸς τὸ μὴ δουλεύειν ἄνδρα ἐκ Ἰουδαίων.
10 Καὶ ἐπεστράφησαν πάντες οἱ μεγιστᾶνες, καὶ πᾶς ὁ
λαὸς, οἱ ἐλθόντες εἰς τὴν διαθήκην, τοῦ ἀποστεῖλαι ἕκαστον
τὸν παῖδα αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἕκαστον τὴν παιδίσκην αὐτοῦ, ἐλευθέ-
ρους, πρὸς τὸ μὴ καταδουλοῦσθαι αὐτοὺς ἔτι· καὶ ἐπήκουσαν,
11 καὶ ἔδωσαν. Καὶ ἐπεστράφησαν μετὰ ταῦτα, καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν
τοὺς παῖδας καὶ τὰς παιδίσκας, οὓς ἐξαπέστειλαν ἐλευθέρους,
12 καὶ ἔσχον αὐτοὺς εἰς παῖδας καὶ παιδίσκας. Καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος
13 Κυρίου πρὸς Ἱερεμίαν, λέγων· οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσ-
ραήλ· ἐγὼ διεθέμην διαθήκην πρὸς τοὺς πατέρας ὑμῶν ἐν τῇ
ἡμέρᾳ, ᾗ ἐξειλάμην αὐτοὺς ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, ἐξ οἴκου δουλείας,
14 λέγων· ὅταν πληρωθῇ ἓξ ἔτη, ἀποστελεῖς τὸν ἀδελφόν σου τὸν
Ἑβραῖον, ὃς πραθήσεταί σοι, καὶ ἐργᾶται σοι ἓξ ἔτη, καὶ ἀπο-
στελεῖς αὐτὸν ἐλεύθερον ἀπὸ σοῦ· καὶ οὐκ ἤκουσαν μου οἱ πατέ-
15 ρές ὑμῶν, καὶ οὐκ ἔκλιναν τὸ οὖς αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐπεστρέψατε
σήμερον ποιῆσαι τὸ εὐθὲς ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς μου, τοῦ καλέσαι ἄφε-
σιν ἕκαστος τῷ πλησίον αὐτοῦ· καὶ συνετελέσατε διαθήκην κατὰ
πρόσωπόν μου ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ, οὗ ἐπεκλήθη τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ.
16 Καὶ ἐπεστρέψατε, καὶ ἐβεβηλώσατε τὴν διαθήκην μου, τοῦ ἐ-
πιστρέψαι ἕκαστον τὸν παῖδα αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἕκαστον τὴν παιδίσκην

**JEREMIAH 34**

**3** ...thine eyes shall see his eyes, and his mouth with thy mouth shall speak, and into Babylon thou shalt go.
**4** But hear thou the word of the Lord concerning thee, O Zedekiah, King of Judah: Thus saith the Lord,
**5** "Thou shalt not die by the sword; in peace shalt thou die. And as they burned [incense for] thy fathers, the kings who reigned before thee, so shall they burn for thee, O Lord, and O Adon; they shall weep for thee, for I have spoken the word, saith the Lord."
**6** And Jeremiah the prophet spoke unto Zedekiah, the King of Judah, all these words in Jerusalem.
**7** And the army of the King of Babylon warred against Jerusalem, and against the cities of Judah which were left, even against Lachish and against Azekah; for these remained among the cities of Judah [as] fortified cities.
**8** The word that came unto Jeremiah from the Lord, after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people who were in Jerusalem,
**9** to proclaim liberty unto them, to send forth every man his manservant and every man his maidservant, the Hebrew man and the Hebrew woman, free, so that no man of the Judeans should serve.
**10** And all the princes, and all the people, who had entered into the covenant, returned, to send away every man his manservant and every man his maidservant, free, so that they should no longer be enslaved; and they hearkened and gave [them liberty].
**11** But afterward they turned [again], and brought back the manservants and the maidservants, whom they had sent forth free, and held them for manservants and maidservants.
**12** Then the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah, saying:
**13** Thus saith the Lord God of Israel: I made a covenant with your fathers in the day when I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage,
**14** saying, "When six years shall be fulfilled, thou shalt send away thy Hebrew brother, who shall be sold unto thee; and he shall serve thee six years, and thou shalt send him away free from thee." But your fathers hearkened not unto Me, neither did they incline their ear.
**15** And ye turned today to do that which was right in My sight, to proclaim liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye made a covenant before Me in the house upon which My Name was called.
**16** But ye turned [again], and defiled My covenant, by bringing back every man his manservant and every man his maidservant,
