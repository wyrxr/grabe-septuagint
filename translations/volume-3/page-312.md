**6** κατὰ τοῦ οἴκου βασιλέως Ἰούδα· Γαλαὰδ σὺ μοι ἀρχὴ τοῦ Λιβάνου, ἐὰν μὴ θῶ σε εἰς ἔρημον, πόλεις μὴ κατοικηθησομένας,
**7** καὶ εἰσάξω ἐπὶ σὲ ἄνδρα ὀλεθρεύοντα, καὶ τὸν πέλεκυν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐκκόψουσι τὰς ἐκλεκτὰς κέδρους σου, καὶ ἐμβαλοῦσιν εἰς τὸ
**8** πῦρ. Καὶ διελεύσονται ἔθνη πολλὰ διὰ τῆς πόλεως ταύτης, καὶ ἐροῦσιν ἕκαστος πρὸς τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ· διατί ἐποίησε Κύριος
**9** οὕτως τῇ πόλει τῇ μεγάλῃ ταύτῃ; Καὶ ἐροῦσιν, ἀνθ᾿ ὧν ἐγκατέλιπον τὴν διαθήκην Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ αὐτῶν, καὶ προσεκύνησαν θεοῖς ἀλλοτρίοις, καὶ ἐδούλευσαν αὐτοῖς.
**10** Μὴ κλαίετε τὸν τεθνηκότα, μηδὲ θρηνεῖτε αὐτόν· κλαύσατε κλαυθμῷ τὸν ἐκπορευόμενον, ὅτι οὐκ ἀναστρέψει ἔτι, οὐδὲ ὄψεται τὴν γῆν πατρίδος αὐτοῦ.
**11** Διότι τάδε λέγει Κύριος ἐπὶ Σελλὴμ υἱὸν Ἰωσίου τοῦ βασιλέως Ἰούδα τὸν βασιλεύοντα ἀντὶ Ἰωσία τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ, ὃς ἐξῆλθεν ἐκ τοῦ τόπου τούτου· οὐκ ἀναστρέψει ἐκεῖ
**12** οὐκέτι, ἀλλ᾿ ἢ ἐν τῷ τόπῳ, οὗ μετώκισα αὐτόν, ἐκεῖ ἀποθανεῖται, καὶ τὴν γῆν ταύτην οὐκ ὄψεται ἔτι.
**13** Οὐαὶ ὁ οἰκοδομῶν τὴν οἰκίαν αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἐν δικαιοσύνῃ, καὶ τὰ ὑπερῷα αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἐν κρίματι, παρὰ τῷ πλησίον αὐτοῦ ἐργᾶται δωρεάν, καὶ τὸν μισθὸν αὐτοῦ οὐ μὴ ἀποδώσει αὐτῷ.
**14** Ὠκοδόμησας σεαυτῷ οἶκον σύμμετρον, ὑπερῷα ῥιπιστὰ διεσταλμένα θυρίσι, καὶ ἐξυλωμένα ἐν κέδρῳ καὶ κεχρισμένα ἐν μίλτῳ.
**15** Μὴ βασιλεύσεις, ὅτι σὺ παροξυνῇ ἐν Ἄχαζ τῷ πατρί σου· οὐ φάγονται, καὶ οὐ πίονται· βέλτιον ἦν σε ποιεῖν κρῖμα καὶ δικαιοσύνην καλήν.
**16** Οὐκ ἔγνωσαν, οὐκ ἔκριναν κρίσιν ταπεινῶν, οὐδὲ κρίσιν πένητος· οὐ τοῦτό σοι ἐστι τὸ μὴ γνῶναι σε ἐμέ, λέγει Κύριος ;
**17** Ἰδοὺ οὐκ εἰσιν οἱ ὀφθαλμοί σου, οὐδὲ ἡ καρδία σου καλή, ἀλλὰ εἰς τὴν πλεονεξίαν σου, καὶ εἰς τὸ αἷμα τὸ ἀθῷον τοῦ ἐκχέειν αὐτό, καὶ εἰς ἀδικήματα καὶ εἰς φόνον, τοῦ ποιεῖν ταῦτα.
**18** Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Κύριος ἐπὶ Ἰωακεὶμ υἱὸν Ἰωσία βασιλέα Ἰούδα· οὐαὶ ἐπὶ τὸν ἄνδρα τοῦτον, οὐ μὴ κόψονται αὐτόν, οὐαὶ ἀδελφέ, οὐδὲ μὴ κλαύσονται αὐτόν, οἴμοι Κύριε.
**19** Ταφὴν ὄνου ταφήσεται, συρθεὶς ῥιφήσεται ἐπέκεινα τῆς πύλης Ἱερουσαλήμ.
**20** Ἀνάβηθι εἰς τὸν Λίβανον, καὶ κέκραξον, καὶ εἰς τὴν Βασὰν δὸς τὴν φωνήν σου, καὶ βόησον εἰς τὸ πέραν τῆς θαλάσσης, ὅτι συνετερίβησαν πάντες οἱ ἐρασταί σου.
**21** Ἐλάλησα πρὸς σὲ ἐν τῇ παραπτώσει σου, καὶ εἶπας, οὐκ ἀκούσομαι· αὕτη ἡ ὁδός σου ἐκ νεότητός σου, ὅτι οὐκ

### JEREMIAH 22

**6** against the house of the king of Judah: 'Thou art to Me Gilead, the beginning of Lebanon; yet surely I will make thee a wilderness, cities that shall not be inhabited;
**7** and I will bring upon thee a man who destroyeth, and his axe; and they shall cut down thy choicest cedars, and cast them into the fire.
**8** And many nations shall pass through this city, and each one shall say to his neighbour, "Wherefore hath the Lord done thus unto this great city?"
**9** And they shall answer, "Because they forsook the covenant of the Lord their God, and worshipped strange gods, and served them."
**10** Weep not for the dead, neither lament him; weep ye bitterly for him that goeth forth, for he shall return no more, neither shall he see the land of his nativity.
**11** For thus saith the Lord concerning Shallum the son of Josiah, king of Judah, who reigneth instead of Josiah his father, who went forth from this place: 'He shall not return thither any more,
**12** but in the place whither I have carried him away, there shall he die, and this land shall he see no more.'
**13** Woe unto him that buildeth his house not in righteousness, and his upper chambers not in judgment; who useth his neighbour's labour without wages, and his hire will he not give him.
**14** Thou hast built for thyself a house well-proportioned, upper chambers airy, extended with windows, and paneled with cedar, and painted with vermilion.
**15** Shalt thou reign? for thou art zealous in [the ways of] Ahaz thy father. They shall not eat, neither shall they drink. It were better for thee to execute good judgment and righteousness.
**16** They knew not, they judged not the cause of the humble, nor the cause of the poor. Is this not that thou knowest Me not, saith the Lord?
**17** Behold, thine eyes are not [fixed upon righteousness], neither is thy heart good, but [given over] to thy covetousness, and to the innocent blood, to shed it, and to injustices and to murder, to do these things.
**18** Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah: 'Woe upon this man! They shall not mourn for him, [saying] "Woe, brother!" neither shall they lament him, [saying] "Alas, O Lord!"
**19** With the burial of an ass shall he be buried, dragged forth shall he be cast beyond the gates of Jerusalem.
**20** Go up to Lebanon, and cry, and in Bashan lift up thy voice, and cry aloud to the other side of the sea; for all thy lovers are crushed.
**21** I spake unto thee in thy transgression, and thou saidst, 'I will not hear.' This hath been thy way from thy youth, for thou hast not
