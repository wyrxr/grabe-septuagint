**10** σαλήμ, καὶ καιροὺς τρεῖς τῆς ἡμέρας ἦν κάμπτων ἐπὶ τὰ γόνατα αὐτοῦ, καὶ προσευχόμενος καὶ ἐξομολογούμενος ἐναντίον τοῦ Θεοῦ αὐτοῦ, καθὼς ἦν ποιῶν ἔμπροσθεν.
**11** Τότε οἱ ἄνδρες ἐκεῖνοι παρετήρησαν, καὶ εὗρον τὸν Δανιὴλ ἀξιοῦντα καὶ δεόμενον τοῦ Θεοῦ αὐτοῦ.
**12** Καὶ προσελθόντες λέγουσι τῷ βασιλεῖ· βασιλεῦ, οὐχὶ ὁρισμὸν ἔταξας, ὅπως πᾶς ἄνθρωπος ὃς ἂν αἰτήσηται παρὰ παντὸς Θεοῦ καὶ ἀνθρώπου αἴτημα, ἕως ἡμερῶν τριάκοντα, ἀλλ’ ἢ παρὰ σοῦ, βασιλεῦ, ἐμβληθήσεται εἰς τὸν λάκκον τῶν λεόντων; καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεύς· ἀληθινὸς ὁ λόγος, καὶ τὸ δόγμα Μήδων καὶ Περσῶν οὐ παρελεύσεται.
**13** Τότε ἀπεκρίθησαν, καὶ λέγουσιν ἐνώπιον τοῦ βασιλέως· Δανιήλ, ὁ ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας τῆς Ἰουδαίας, οὐχ ὑπετάγη τῷ δόγματί σου περὶ τοῦ ὁρισμοῦ οὗ ἔταξας, καὶ καιροὺς τρεῖς τῆς ἡμέρας αἰτεῖται παρὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ αὐτοῦ τὰ αἰτήματα αὐτοῦ.
**14** Τότε ὁ βασιλεύς, ὡς τὸ ρῆμα ἤκουσε, πολὺ ἐλυπήθη ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ, καὶ περὶ τοῦ Δανιὴλ ἠγωνίσατο τοῦ ἐξελέσθαι αὐτὸν, καὶ ἕως ἑσπέρας ἦν ἀγωνιζόμενος τοῦ ἐξελέσθαι αὐτόν.
**15** Τότε οἱ ἄνδρες ἐκεῖνοι λέγουσι τῷ βασιλεῖ· γνῶθι βασιλεῦ, ὅτι τὸ δόγμα Μήδοις καὶ Πέρσαις, τοῦ πᾶν ὁρισμὸν καὶ στάσιν ἣν ἂν ὁ βασιλεὺς στήσῃ, οὐ δεῖ παραλλάξαι.
**16** Τότε ὁ βασιλεὺς εἶπε, καὶ ἤγαγον τὸν Δανιὴλ, καὶ ἐνέβαλον αὐτὸν εἰς τὸν λάκκον τῶν λεόντων, καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τῷ Δανιήλ· ὁ Θεός σου ᾧ σὺ λατρεύεις ἐνδελεχῶς, αὐτὸς ἐξελεῖταί σε.
**17** Καὶ ἤνεγκε λίθον, καὶ ἐπέθηκεν ἐπὶ τὸ στόμα τοῦ λάκκου, καὶ ἐσφραγίσατο ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐν τῷ δακτυλίῳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐν τῷ δακτυλίῳ τῶν μεγιστάνων αὐτοῦ, ὅπως μὴ ἀλλοιωθῇ πρᾶγμα ἐν τῷ Δανιήλ.
**18** Καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ὁ βασιλεὺς εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐκοιμήθη ἄδειπνος, καὶ ἐδέσματα οὐκ εἰσηνέχθη αὐτῷ· καὶ ὁ ὕπνος αὐτοῦ ἀπέστη ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἔκλεισεν ὁ Θεὸς τὰ στόματα τῶν λεόντων, καὶ οὐ παρηνώχλησαν τῷ Δανιήλ.
**19** Τότε ὁ βασιλεὺς ἀνέστη τὸ πρωΐ ἐν τῷ φωτὶ, καὶ ἐν σπουδῇ ἦλθεν ἐπὶ τὸν λάκκον τῶν λεόντων.
**20** Καὶ ἐν τῷ ἐγγίζειν αὐτὸν τῷ λάκκῳ, τῷ Δανιὴλ ἐβόησε φωνῇ ἰσχυρᾷ· Δανιὴλ ὁ δοῦλος τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ ζῶντος, ὁ Θεός σου ᾧ σὺ λατρεύεις ἐνδελεχῶς, εἰ ἠδυνάσθη ἐξελέσθαι σε ἐκ στόματος τῶν λεόντων;
**21** Καὶ εἶπε Δανιὴλ τῷ βασιλεῖ· βασιλεῦ, εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας ζῆθι·
**22** Ὁ Θεός μου ἀπέστειλε τὸν ἄγγελον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐνέφραξε τὰ στόματα τῶν λεόντων, καὶ οὐκ ἐλυμήναντό με, ὅτι κατεναντίον αὐτοῦ εὐθύτης εὑρέθη ἐν ἐμοί, καὶ ἐνώπιον δέ σου, βασιλεῦ, παράπτωμα οὐκ ἐποίησα.

**10** ...toward Jerusalem; and three times a day he kneeled upon his knees, and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as he was wont to do aforetime.
**11** Then those men watched and found Daniel asking and making supplication before his God.
**12** And they came near and spake before the king, saying, "O King, didst thou not sign a decree, that every man who should ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, save of thee, O King, should be cast into the den of lions?" And the king answered and said, "The word is true, and the decree of the Medes and Persians shall not pass away."
**13** Then they answered and said before the king, "Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Judah, hath not submitted himself unto thy decree concerning the ordinance which thou hast set, and three times a day doth he ask his petitions from his God."
**14** Then the king, when he heard this word, was exceedingly grieved for him, and was greatly troubled concerning Daniel to deliver him; and until the evening he strove to deliver him.
**15** Then these men spake unto the king, saying, "Know, O King, that it is a law unto the Medes and Persians that no decree or statute which the king establisheth may be altered."
**16** Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. And the king spake unto Daniel, saying, "Thy God Whom thou dost serve continually, He Himself shall deliver thee."
**17** And a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own ring, and with the ring of his great nobles, that no purpose might be changed concerning Daniel.
**18** Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting; neither were dainties brought before him: and his sleep departed from him. And God shut the mouths of the lions, and they harmed not Daniel.
**19** Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions.
**20** And when he drew near unto the den, he cried with a mighty voice unto Daniel, saying, "O Daniel, thou servant of the living God, hath thy God Whom thou dost serve continually, been able to deliver thee from the mouths of the lions?"
**21** Then Daniel spake unto the king, "O King, live forever!
**22** My God hath sent His Angel, and hath shut the mouths of the lions, and they have not hurt me, because before Him innocency was found in me; and before thee, O King, no fault have I committed."
