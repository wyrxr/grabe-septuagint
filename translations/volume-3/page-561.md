1 Ἰδοὺ ἐπὶ τὰ ὄρη οἱ πόδες εὐαγγελιζομένου, καὶ ἀπαγγέλλοντος εἰρήνην· ἑόρταζε Ἰούδα τὰς ἑορτάς σου, ἀπόδος τὰς εὐχάς σου, διότι οὐ μὴ προσθῶσιν ἔτι τοῦ διελθεῖν διά σου εἰς παλαίωσιν· συντετέλεσται, ἐξῆρται·
2 ἀνέβη ἐμφυσῶν εἰς πρόσωπόν σου, ἐξαιρούμενός σε ἐκ θλίψεως. σκόπευσον ὁδὸν, κράτησον ὀσφύος, ἄνδρισε τῇ ἰσχύϊ σφόδρα·
3 διότι ἀπέστρεψε Κύριος τὴν ὕβριν Ἰακώβ, καθὼς ὕβριν τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, διότι ἐκτινάξοντες ἐξετίναξαν αὐτοὺς, καὶ τὰ κλήματα αὐτῶν διέφθειραν.
4 Ὅπλα δυναστείας αὐτῶν ἐξ ἀνθρώπων, ἄνδρας δυνατοὺς ἐμπαίζοντας ἐν πυρί· αἱ ἡνίαι τῶν ἁρμάτων αὐτῶν ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ἑτοιμασίας αὐτοῦ, καὶ οἱ ἱππεῖς θορυβηθήσονται ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς, καὶ συγχυθήσονται τὰ ἅρματα,
5 καὶ συμπλακήσονται ἐν ταῖς πλατείαις· ἡ ὅρασις αὐτῶν ὡς λαμπάδες πυρὸς, καὶ ὡς ἀστραπαὶ διατρέχουσαι.
6 Καὶ μνησθήσονται οἱ μεγιστᾶνες αὐτῶν, καὶ φεύξονται ἡμέρας, καὶ ἀσθενήσουσιν ἐν ταῖς πορείαις αὐτῶν, καὶ σπεύσουσιν ἐπὶ τὰ τείχη αὐτῆς, καὶ ἑτοιμάσουσι τὰς προφυλακὰς αὐτῶν.
7 πύλαι τῶν πόλεων διηνοίχθησαν, καὶ τὰ βασίλεια διέπεσαν, καὶ ἡ ὑπόστασις ἀπεκαλύφθη· καὶ αὕτη ἀνέβαινε, καὶ αἱ δοῦλαι αὐτῆς ἤγοντο, καθὼς περιστεραὶ φθεγγόμεναι ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις αὐτῶν.
8 Καὶ Νινεϋ ἦν ὡς κολυμβήθρα ὕδατος τείχη ὕδατα αὐτῆς, καὶ αὐτοὶ φεύγοντες οὐκ ἔστησαν, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ ἐπιβλέπων.
9 Διήρπαζον τὸ ἀργύριον, διήρπαζον τὸ χρυσίον, καὶ οὐκ ἦν πέρας τοῦ κόσμου αὐτῆς· βεβάρυνται ὑπὲρ πάντα τὰ σκεύη τὰ ἐπιθυμητὰ αὐτῆς.
10 Ἐκτιναγμὸς καὶ ἀνατιναγμὸς, καὶ ἐκθρασμὸς, καὶ καρδίας θραυσμὸς, καὶ ὑπόλυσις γονάτων, καὶ ὠδῖνες ἐπὶ πᾶσαν ὀσφῦν, καὶ τὸ πρόσωπον πάντων ὡς πρόσκαυμα χύτρας.
11 ποῦ ἐστι τὸ κατοικητήριον τῶν λεόντων, καὶ ἡ νομὴ ἡ οὖσα τοῖς σκύμνοις; οὗ ἐπορεύθη λέων τοῦ εἰσελθεῖν, ἐκεῖ σκύμνος λέοντος, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ ἔκφοβων.
12 Λέων ἥρπασε τὰ ἱκανὰ τοῖς σκύμνοις αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀπένιξε τοῖς λέουσιν αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἔπλησε θήρας νοσσιὰν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὸ κατοικητήριον αὐτοῦ ἁρπαγῆς.
13 Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐπὶ σὲ, λέγει Κύριος ὁ παντοκράτωρ, καὶ ἐκκαύσω ἐν καπνῷ πλῆθός σου, καὶ τοὺς λέοντάς σου καταφάγεται ῥομφαία· καὶ ἐξολεθρεύσω ἐκ τῆς γῆς τὴν θήραν σου, καὶ οὐκέτι οὐ μὴ ἀκουσθῇ τὰ ἔργα σου.

NAHUM
CHAPTER II

**1** Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, and proclaimeth peace. Keep thy feasts, O Judah, render thy vows, for they shall no more continue to pass through thee for desolation; it is accomplished, it is lifted up.
**2** He that delivereth thee from tribulation is ascended, breathing [His Spirit] into thy face. Watch the way, gird thy loins, strengthen thyself mightily with all thy power.
**3** For the Lord hath turned back the outrage against Jacob, even as the outrage against Israel, because they [the adversaries] had utterly shaken them out, and destroyed their branches.
**4** The weapons of their dominion are from among men; mighty men are they, mocking in the fire. The reins of their chariots shall be [made ready] on the day of His preparation, and the horsemen shall be troubled in the ways, and the chariots shall be confounded.
**5** And they shall clash together in the broadways; their appearance [shall be] like torches of fire, and like flashes of lightning, running to and fro.
**6** And their magnates shall be called to remembrance, and they shall flee by day, and shall faint in their marches; and they shall hasten to her walls, and shall prepare their defenses.
**7** The gates of the cities were opened, and the palaces fell down, and her foundation was uncovered. And she went up, and her handmaidens were led forth, cooing in their hearts as doves.
**8** And Nineveh was as a pool of water; her walls [were] waters, yet they fleeing stood not still, and there was none to look back [upon them].
**9** They plundered the silver, they plundered the gold, and there was no end to her adornment; she is laden with all her desirable vessels.
**10** There shall be a shaking out and an upheaval, and a shattering, and a crushing of hearts, and a loosening of knees, and pangs upon every loin, and the face of all [shall be] as the scorching of a pot.
**11** Where is the dwelling place of the lions, and the feeding ground that was for the lion cubs? Where the lion went forth to enter, there [went forth] the lion's cub, and there was none to terrify [them].
**12** The lion seized enough for his cubs, and strangled [prey] for his lions; and he filled his den with prey, and his dwelling place with plunder.
**13** Behold, I am against thee, saith the Lord Almighty, and I will burn up thy multitude in smoke, and the sword shall devour thy lions; and I will utterly destroy thy prey from the earth, and thy deeds shall be heard no more.
