ΚΕΦ. Ε΄.
**3** [οὐχ ὑπάρ]χει πατὴρ, μητέρες ἡμῶν ὡς χῆραι. Ὕδωρ ἡμῶν ἐν ἀργυρίῳ ἐπίνομεν,
**4** Ξύλα ἡμῶν ἐν ἀλλάγματι ἦλθον ἐπὶ τὸν τράχηλον ἡμῶν.
**5** Ἐδιώχθημεν, ἐκοπιάσαμεν, οὐκ ἀνεπαύθημεν.
**6** Αἴγυπτος ἔδωκε χεῖρα, Ἀσσοὺρ εἰς πλησμονὴν αὑτῶν.
**7** Οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν ἥμαρτον, οὐχ ὑπάρχουσιν, ἡμεῖς τὰ ἀνομήματα αὑτῶν ὑπέσχομεν.
**8** Δοῦλοι ἐκυρίευσαν ἡμῶν, λυτρούμενος οὐκ ἔστιν ἐκ τῆς χειρὸς αὑτῶν.
**9** Ἐν ταῖς ψυχαῖς ἡμῶν εἰσοίσομεν ἄρτον ἡμῶν, ἀπὸ προσώπου ῥομφαίας τῆς ἐρήμου.
**10** Τὸ δέρμα ἡμῶν ὡς κλίβανος ἐπελιώθη, συνεσπάσθησαν ἀπὸ προσώπου καταιγίδων λιμοῦ.
**11** Γυναῖκας ἐν Σιὼν ἐταπείνωσαν, παρθένους ἐν πόλεσιν Ἰούδα.
**12** Ἄρχοντες ἐν χερσὶν αὑτῶν ἐκρεμάσθησαν, πρεσβύτεροι οὐκ ἐδοξάσθησαν.
**13** Ἐκλεκτοὶ κλαυθμὸν ἀνέλαβον, καὶ νεανίσκοι ἐν ξύλῳ ἠσθένησαν.
**14** Καὶ πρεσβύται ἀπὸ πύλης κατέπαυσαν, ἐκλεκτοὶ ἐκ ψαλμῶν αὑτῶν κατέπαυσαν.
**15** Κατέλυσε χαρὰ καρδίας ἡμῶν, ἐστράφη εἰς πένθος ὁ χορὸς ἡμῶν, ἔπεσεν ὁ στέφανος τῆς κεφαλῆς ἡμῶν.
**16** Οὐαὶ δὲ ἡμῖν ὅτι ἡμάρτομεν.
**17** Περὶ τούτου ἐγενήθη ὀδυνηρὰ ἡ καρδία ἡμῶν, περὶ τούτου ἐσκότασαν οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ ἡμῶν.
**18** Ἐπ᾽ ὄρος Σιὼν, ὅτι ἠφανίσθη, ἀλώπεκες διῆλθον ἐν αὐτῇ.
**19** Σὺ δὲ, Κύριε, εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα κατοικήσεις, ὁ θρόνος σου εἰς γενεὰν καὶ γενεάν.
**20** Ἵνατί εἰς νῖκος ἐπιλήσῃ ἡμῶν, καταλείψεις ἡμᾶς εἰς μακρότητα ἡμερῶν;
**21** Ἐπίστρεφον ἡμᾶς, Κύριε, πρὸς σὲ, καὶ ἐπιστραφησόμεθα· καὶ ἀνακαίνισον ἡμέρας ἡμῶν καθὼς ἔμπροσθεν.
**22** Ὅτι ἀπωθούμενος ἀπώσω ἡμᾶς, ὠργίσθης ἐφ᾿ ἡμᾶς ἕως σφόδρα.

**Chapter V.**

**3** No father hath remained unto us; our mothers are become as widows.
**4** Our water we did drink for silver; and for a price our wood came upon our neck.
**5** We have been pursued, we have toiled grievously, and found no rest.
**6** Egypt did proffer her hand, [yet] Assyria [took us] for their own satiety.
**7** Our fathers have sinned, and they are no more; yet we have borne their iniquities.
**8** Slaves have gained mastery over us; there is none to deliver [us] from their hand.
**9** With peril of our lives we fetch our bread, from the face of the sword of the wilderness.
**10** Our skin, parched as a furnace, was shriveled from the fierce onset of famine.
**11** They did humble the women in Zion, yea, the virgins in the cities of Judah.
**12** Princes were hanged at their very hands; the elders were not held in honor.
**13** The choice men took up lamentation, and young men were made faint by the wood.
**14** And the elders ceased from the gate; the choice men ceased from their psalms.
**15** The joy of our hearts hath ceased; our dance is turned into mourning; the crown of our head is fallen.
**16** Woe unto us, for we have sinned!
**17** For this [cause] our heart is grown sorrowful; for this [cause] our eyes are darkened.
**18** Upon Mount Zion, for it is made desolate, foxes walk therein.
**19** But Thou, O Lord, shalt dwell forever; Thy throne [endureth] from generation unto generation.
**20** Why dost Thou utterly forget us, and forsake us for the length of many days?
**21** Turn Thou us, O Lord, unto Thyself, and we shall be turned; and renew our days as in times past.
**22** For Thou hast utterly cast us away, [yea,] Thou hast been exceedingly wroth against us.
