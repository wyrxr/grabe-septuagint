37 θύρας τοῦ παραδείσου, καὶ ἦλθε πρὸς αὐτὴν νεανίσκος, ὃς ἦν κε-
38 κρυμμένος, καὶ ἀνέπεσε μετ᾽ αὐτῆς. Ἡμεῖς δὲ ὄντες ἐν τῇ γωνίᾳ
τοῦ παραδείσου, ἰδόντες τὴν ἀνομίαν, ἐδράμομεν ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς· καὶ
39 ἰδόντες συγγινομένους αὐτοὺς, ἐκείνου μὲν οὐχ ἠδυνήθημεν περι-
40 κρατεῖς γενέσθαι, διὰ τὸ ἰσχύειν αὐτὸν ὑπὲρ ἡμᾶς, καὶ ἀνοίξαντα
41 τὰς θύρας ἐκπεπηδηκέναι. Ταύτης δὲ ἐπιλαβόμενοι, ἐπηρωτῶμεν,
42 τίς ἦν ὁ νεανίσκος; Καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησεν ἀπαγγεῖλαι ἡμῖν· ταῦτα
μαρτυροῦμεν· καὶ ἐπίστευσεν αὐτοῖς ἡ συναγωγὴ ὡς πρεσβυτέ-
ροις τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ κριταῖς, καὶ κατέκριναν αὐτὴν ἀποθανεῖν.
43 Καὶ ἀνεβόησε φωνῇ μεγάλῃ Σουσάννα, καὶ εἶπεν· ὁ Θεὸς ὁ αἰώνιος,
44 ὁ τῶν κρυπτῶν γνώστης, ὁ εἰδὼς τὰ πάντα πρὶν γενέσεως αὐ-
τῶν, σὺ ἐπίστασαι, ὅτι ψευδῆ μου κατεμαρτύρησαν· καὶ ἰδοὺ ἀπο-
θνήσκω, μὴ ποιήσασα μηδέν, ὧν οὗτοι ἐπονηρεύσαντο κατ᾽ ἐμοῦ.
45 Καὶ ἐπήκουσεν ὁ Θεὸς τῆς φωνῆς αὐτῆς. Καὶ ἀπαγομένης αὐτῆς
ἀπολέσθαι, ἐξήγειρεν ὁ Θεὸς τὸ πνεῦμα τὸ ἅγιον παιδαρίου νεω-
46 τέρου, ᾧ ὄνομα Δανιήλ. Καὶ ἐβόησε φωνῇ μεγάλῃ· καθαρὸς
47 ἐγὼ ἀπὸ τοῦ αἵματος ταύτης. Ἐπέστρεψε δὲ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς πρὸς
48 αὐτὸν, καὶ εἶπαν· τίς ὁ λόγος οὗτος, ὃν σὺ λελάληκας; Ὁ δὲ στὰς
ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῶν εἶπεν, οὕτως μωροὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ· οὐκ ἀνακρί-
49 ναντες, οὐδὲ τὸ σαφὲς ἐπιγνόντες, κατεκρίνατε θυγατέρα Ἰσρα-
50 ήλ; Ἀναστρέψατε εἰς τὸ κριτήριον· ψευδῆ γὰρ οὗτοι κατεμαρ-
τύρησαν αὐτῆς. Καὶ ἀνέστρεψε πᾶς ὁ λαὸς μετὰ σπουδῆς·
51 καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῷ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι· δεῦρο, κάθισον ἐν μέσῳ ἡμῶν, καὶ
52 ἀπάγγειλον ἡμῖν, ὅτι σοι ἔδωκεν ὁ Θεὸς τὸ πρεσβεῖον. Καὶ εἶπε
πρὸς αὐτοὺς Δανιήλ· διαχωρίσατε αὐτοὺς ἀπ᾽ ἀλλήλων μακρὰν,
καὶ ἀνακρινῶ αὐτούς. Ὡς δὲ διεχωρίσθησαν εἷς ἀπὸ τοῦ ἑνὸς,
53 ἐκάλεσε τὸν ἕνα αὐτῶν, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτόν· πεπαλαιωμένε ἡμε-
ρῶν κακῶν, νῦν ἥκασιν αἱ ἁμαρτίαι σου, ἃς ἐποίεις τοπρότερον
54 κρίνων κρίσεις ἀδίκους· καὶ τοὺς μὲν ἀθώους κατακρίνων, ἀπο-
λύων δὲ τοὺς αἰτίους, λέγοντος τοῦ Κυρίου· ἀθῶον καὶ δίκαιον
οὐκ ἀποκτενεῖς. Νῦν οὖν ταύτην εἴπερ εἶδες, εἰπὸν, ὑπὸ τί δέν-
55 δρον εἶδες αὐτοὺς ὁμιλοῦντας ἀλλήλοις; Ὁ δὲ εἶπεν, ὑπὸ σχῖνον.
56 Εἶπε δὲ Δανιήλ· ὀρθῶς ἔψευσαι εἰς τὴν σεαυτοῦ κεφαλήν· ἤδη
γὰρ ἄγγελος τοῦ Θεοῦ λαβὼν φάσιν παρὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ, σχίσει σε μέσον.

³⁷...the gates of the garden, and there came unto her a young man who was hidden,
³⁸ and he lay with her. And we, being in a corner of the garden, when we beheld the iniquity, ran upon them;
³⁹ and seeing them in coition, we could not lay hold of the man,
⁴⁰ for he was stronger than we, and having opened the gates, he leapt forth.
⁴¹ But having laid hold of this woman, we asked,
⁴² "Who was the young man?" And she would not tell us. "These things we bear witness [unto]." And the assembly believed them, as they were elders of the people and judges, and they condemned her to death.

⁴³ Then Susanna cried with a loud voice, and said, "O Eternal God,
⁴⁴ Thou knower of hidden things, Who knowest all things ere they come to be, Thou knowest that they have borne false witness against me; and behold, I die, having done nothing of those evil things which these have devised against me."
⁴⁵ And God heard her voice. And as she was led away to be put to death, God raised up the Holy Spirit of a young child, whose name was Daniel.
⁴⁶ And he cried with a loud voice, "I am innocent of the blood of this woman!"
⁴⁷ Then all the people turned back unto him,
⁴⁸ and they said, "What meaneth this word that thou hast spoken?" And he, standing in the midst of them, said, "Are ye so foolish, O sons of Israel?
⁴⁹ Without examination, and without knowing the clear truth, have ye condemned a daughter of Israel?
⁵⁰ Turn ye back to the judgment seat, for these have borne false witness against her." And all the people turned back with haste.
⁵¹ And the elders said unto him, "Come, sit thou in the midst of us,
⁵2 and declare unto us, for God hath given unto thee the seniority." And Daniel said unto them, "Separate them far one from another, and I will examine them." When therefore they were separated one from another,
⁵³ he called one of them, and said unto him, "O thou that art grown old in wickedness, now are thy sins come forth, which thou didst commit aforetime,
⁵⁴ judging unrighteous judgments; condemning the innocent and letting the guilty go free, even as the Lord hath said, 'Thou shalt not slay the innocent and the righteous.' Now therefore, if indeed thou sawest her, tell me, under what tree didst thou see them conversing with one another?"
⁵⁵ And he said, "Under a mastic tree."
⁵⁶ Then Daniel said, "Rightly hast thou lied against thine own head; for behold, an angel of God hath already received a divine sentence from God to cleave thee in two."
