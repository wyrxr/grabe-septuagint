ΚΕΦ. ΚϚ΄. ΙΕΖΕIΗΛ 1374
            ἥτις ἐγενήθη ἰσχυρὰ ἐν θαλάσσῃ, αὕτη καὶ οἱ κατοικοῦντες αὐτὴν·
18 ἡ δοῦσα τὸν φόβον αὐτῆς πᾶσι τοῖς κατοικοῦσιν αὐτὴν. Καὶ νῦν φοβηθήσονται αἱ νῆσοι ἀπὸ ἡμέρας πτώσεώς σου, καὶ ταραχθήσονται αἱ νῆσοι ἐν τῇ θαλάσσῃ ἀπὸ τῆς ἐξοδίας σου.
19 Ὅτι τάδε λέγει Κύριος Κύριος· ὅταν δῶ σε πόλιν ἠρημωμένην ὡς τὰς πόλεις τὰς μὴ κατοικισθησομένας, ἐν τῷ ἀναγαγεῖν με ἐπὶ σὲ τὴν
20 ἄβυσσον, καὶ κατακαλύψει σε ὕδωρ πολύ. Καὶ καταβιβῶ σε πρὸς τοὺς καταβαίνοντας εἰς βόθρον πρὸς λαὸν αἰῶνος, καὶ κατοικιῶ σε εἰς τὰ βάθη τῆς γῆς ὡς ἔρημον αἰώνιον μετὰ καταβαινόντων
21 εἰς βόθρον, ὅπως μὴ κατοικηθῇς, μηδὲ ἀνασταθῇς ἐπὶ γῆς ζωῆς. Ἀπώλειάν σε δώσω, καὶ οὐχ ὑπάρξεις ἔτι· καὶ ζητηθήσῃ καὶ οὐχ εὑρεθήσῃ ἔτι εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, λέγει Κύριος Κύριος ὁ Θεός.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΖ΄. XXVII.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς με, λέγων·
2 καὶ σὺ υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, λάβε θρῆνον ἐπὶ Σὸρ,
3 καὶ ἐρεῖς τῇ Σὸρ τῇ κατοικούσῃ ἐπὶ τῆς εἰσόδου τῆς θαλάσσης, τῷ ἐμπορίῳ τῶν λαῶν, ἀπὸ νήσων πολλῶν· τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναὶ Κύριος Κύριος τῇ Σόρ· σὺ εἶπας·
4 ἐγὼ περιέθηκα ἐμαυτῇ κάλλος μου, ἐν καρδίᾳ θαλάσσης τῷ Βελεὶμ, καὶ υἱοί σου περιέθηκαν σοι κάλλος. Κέδρος ἐκ Σανεὶρ ᾠκοδομήθη σοι,
5 ταινίαι σανίδων κυπαρίσσου ἐκ τοῦ Λιβάνου ἐλήφθησαν, τοῦ ποιῆσαί σοι ἱστοὺς ἐλατίνους,
6 ἐκ τῆς Βασανίτιδος ἐποίησαν τὰς κώπας σου, τὰ ἱερά σου ἐποίησαν ἐξ ἐλέφαντος, οἴκους ἀλσώδεις ἀπὸ νήσων τῶν Χεττιείμ.
7 Βύσσος μετὰ ποικιλίας ἐξ Αἰγύπτου ἐγένετό σοι στρώμνη, τοῦ περιδεῖναί σοι δόξαν, καὶ περιβαλεῖν σε ὑάκινθον καὶ πορφύραν ἐκ τῶν νήσων Ἐλισαί, καὶ περιβόλαια ἐγένετό σοι.
8 Καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντές σου οἱ κατοικοῦντες Σιδῶνα καὶ Ἀράδιοι ἐγένοντο κωπηλάται σου· οἱ σοφοί σου Σὸρ οἱ ἦσαν ἐν σοὶ, οὗτοι κυβερνῆταί σου.
9 Οἱ πρεσβύτεροι βιβλίων, καὶ οἱ σοφοὶ αὐτῶν ἦσαν ἐν σοὶ, οὗτοι ἐνίσχυον τὴν βουλὴν σου· καὶ πάντα τὰ πλοῖα τῆς θαλάσσης καὶ οἱ κωπηλάται αὐτῶν ἐγένοντό σοι ἐπὶ δυσμὰς δυσμῶν.
10 Πέρσαι, καὶ Λυδοὶ, καὶ Λίβυες ἦσαν ἐν τῇ δυνάμει σου, ἄνδρες πολεμισταί σου πέλτας καὶ περικεφαλαίας ἐκρέμασαν ἐν σοὶ, οὗτοι ἔδωκαν τὴν δόξαν σου.
11 Υἱοὶ Ἀραδίων καὶ ἡ δύναμίς σου ἐπὶ τῶν τειχέων σου κύκλῳ· φύλακες

**Chapter 26**

**17** which wast made strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants, which didst cast her terror upon all them that dwell in her.
**18** Now therefore shall the islands fear from the day of thy fall, and the isles in the sea shall be troubled at thy departure.
**19** For thus saith the Lord, the Lord: "When I shall make thee a desolate city, like unto the cities that shall not be inhabited, when I shall bring up upon thee the deep, and many waters shall cover thee.
**20** And I will bring thee down with them that descend into the Pit, unto a people of old time; and I will cause thee to dwell in the depths of the earth, as an eternal wilderness, with them that go down into the Pit, that thou be not inhabited, nor stand again upon the land of the living.
**21** I will give thee as a terror, and thou shalt be no more; and though thou shalt be sought, yet shalt thou not be found again for evermore," saith the Lord, the Lord God.

**Chapter 27**

**1** Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
**2** "And thou, son of man, take up a lamentation over Tyre;
**3** and thou shalt say unto Tyre, which dwelleth at the entrance of the sea, the mart of the peoples, from many islands: 'Thus saith Adonai the Lord, the Lord unto Tyre: Thou hast said,
**4** "I have perfected my beauty upon myself, in the heart of the sea unto Beleim," and thy sons have compassed thee with beauty. Cedar from Sanir was builded for thee;
**5** planks of cypress from Lebanon were taken, to make for thee masts of fir.
**6** From Bashan they made thine oars; thy sacred furnishings they fashioned of ivory, [even] timbered cabins from the islands of the Kittim.
**7** Fine linen with rich embroidery from Egypt became thy deck-covering, that it might encircle thee with glory; and they arrayed thee with hyacinth and purple from the islands of Elishah, and [these] coverings were made for thee.
**8** And thy princes that dwell in Sidon and the Arvadites became thy rowers; thy wise men, O Tyre, who were in thee, these were thy shipmasters.
**9** The elders of books, and their wise men that were in thee, these strengthened thy counsel; and all the ships of the sea, with their mariners, were for thee unto the utmost West.
**10** Persians, and Lydians, and Libyans were in thy host; thy men of war did hang shields and helmets in thee, these rendered thy glory.
**11** The sons of Arvad, and thy forces, were upon thy walls round about; [and] watchmen"
