βλέπουσαν κατ᾽ ἀνατολάς, καὶ διεμέτρησεν αὐτὴν κατὰ τὰ μέτρα ταῦτα,
33 καὶ τὰ Θεί, καὶ τὰ Αἰλεῦ, καὶ τὰ Αἰλαμμὼθ κατὰ τὰ μέτρα ταῦτα, καὶ αἱ θυρίδες αὐτῇ, καὶ τὰ Αἰλαμμὼθ κύκλῳ πήχεις πεντήκοντα μῆκος αὐτῆς, καὶ τὸ εὖρος αὐτῆς πήχεις εἰκοσιπέντε.
34 Καὶ Αἰλαμμὼθ εἰς τὴν αὐλὴν τὴν ἐσωτέραν, καὶ φοίνικες ἐπὶ τοῦ
35 Αἰλεῦ ἔνθεν καὶ ἔνθεν, καὶ ὀκτὼ κλιμακτῆρες αὐτῇ. Καὶ εἰσήγαγέ με εἰς τὴν πύλην τὴν πρὸς βορρᾶν, καὶ διεμέτρησε κατὰ
36 τὰ μέτρα ταῦτα, καὶ τὰ Θεί, καὶ τὰ Αἰλεῦ, καὶ τὰ Αἰλαμμὼθ, καὶ αἱ θυρίδες αὐτῇ κύκλῳ· καὶ τὰ Αἰλαμμὼθ αὐτῆς κύκλῳ πήχεις πεντήκοντα τὸ μῆκος αὐτῆς, καὶ εὖρος αὐτῆς πήχεις εἰκοσιπέντε,
37 καὶ Αἰλαμμὼθ εἰς τὴν αὐλὴν τὴν ἐξωτέραν, καὶ φοίνικες τῷ Αἰλεῦ ἔνθεν καὶ ἔνθεν, καὶ ὀκτὼ κλιμακτῆρες αὐτῇ.
38 Τὰ παστοφόρια αὐτῆς, καὶ τὰ θυρώματα αὐτῆς, καὶ τὰ Αἰλαμμὼθ αὐτῆς ἐπὶ τῆς πύλης τῆς δευτέρας ἔκρυσις, ἐκεῖ πλύνουσι τὴν ὁλοκαύτωσιν.
39 Ἐν δὲ τῷ Αἰλὰμ τῆς πύλης δύο τράπεζαι ἔνθεν, καὶ δύο τράπεζαι ἔνθεν, (ἐκ χρυσίου) ὅπως σφάζωσιν ἐν αὐταῖς τὴν ὁλοκαύτωσιν καὶ τὰ ὑπὲρ ἁμαρτίας, καὶ τὰ
40 ὑπὲρ ἀγνοίας. Καὶ κατὰ νώτου τοῦ ρύακος τῶν ὁλοκαυτωμάτων τῆς θύρας βλεπούσης πρὸς βορρᾶν, δύο τράπεζαι πρὸς ἀνατολὰς κατὰ νώτου τῆς δευτέρας, καὶ τοῦ Αἰλὰμ τῆς πύλης δύο τράπεζαι,
41 καὶ ὀκτὼ τράπεζαι κατ᾿ ἀνατολάς. Τέσσαρες ἔνθεν, καὶ τέσσαρες ἔνθεν κατὰ νώτου τῆς πύλης, ἐπ᾿ αὐτὰς σφάζουσι τὰ θύματα·
42 κατέναντι τῶν ὀκτὼ τραπεζῶν τῶν θυμάτων, καὶ τέσσαρες τράπεζαι τῶν ὁλοκαυτωμάτων λίθιναι λελαξευμέναι, πήχεως καὶ ἡμίσους τὸ πλάτος, καὶ πήχεων δύο καὶ ἡμίσους τὸ
43 μῆκος, καὶ ἐπὶ πῆχυν τὸ ὕψος· ἐπ᾿ αὐτὰς ἐπιθήσουσὶ τὰ σκεύη, ἐν οἷς σφάζουσιν ἐκεῖ τὰ ὁλοκαυτώματα, καὶ τὰ θύματα. Καὶ παλαιστὴν ἔξουσι γεῖσος λελαξευμένον ἔσωθεν κύκλῳ, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς τραπέζας ἐπάνωθεν στέγας, τοῦ καλύπτεσθαι ἀπὸ τοῦ ὑετοῦ,
44 καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς ξηρασίας. Καὶ εἰσήγαγέ με εἰς τὴν αὐλὴν τὴν ἐσωτέραν, καὶ ἰδοὺ δύο ἐξέδραι ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ τῇ ἐσωτέρᾳ, μία κατὰ νώτου τῆς πύλης τῆς βλεπούσης πρὸς βορρᾶν, φέρουσα πρὸς νότον, καὶ μία κατὰ νώτου τῆς πύλης τῆς πρὸς νότον, βλεπούσης
45 δὲ πρὸς βορρᾶν, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς μέ· ἡ ἐξέδρα αὕτη ἡ βλέπουσα πρὸς νότον, τοῖς ἱερεῦσι τοῖς φυλάσσουσι τὴν φυλακὴν
46 τοῦ οἴκου, καὶ ἡ ἐξέδρα ἡ βλέπουσα πρὸς βορρᾶν, τοῖς ἱερεῦσι

33 And its The', and its Aileu, and its Ailammoth were according to these measures; and its windows, and its Ailammoth round about, the length thereof fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty and five cubits.
34 And Ailammoth [extended] into the inner court; and palm [tree designs were] upon the Aileu,
35 both on this side and on that side; and eight steps were thereunto. And he brought me into the gate that was toward the north; and he measured [it] according to
36 these selfsame measures; and its The', and its Aileu, and its Ailammoth, and its windows round about. And its Ailammoth round about, the length thereof fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty and five cubits;
37 and Ailammoth [extended] into the outer court; and palm [tree designs were] for the Aileu, both on this side and on that side; and eight steps were thereunto.
38 Its pastophoria, and its gatehouses, and its Ailammoth at the second gate [was] a hidden place; there do they wash the burnt offering.

41 and eight tables were toward the east: four on this side, and four on that side, behind the gate; upon these do they slay the offerings.
42 Opposite the eight tables for the offerings, [there were] also four tables for the burnt offerings, [being] of stone, hewn; a cubit and a half was the breadth thereof, and two cubits and a half was the
43 length thereof, and its height one cubit. Upon these shall they lay the instruments, wherein they slay there the burnt offerings, and the [other] sacrifices. And they shall have a palæstra, [even] a coping hewn within round about; and upon the tables above, roofs, that they might be sheltered from the rain
44 and from the drought. And he brought me into the inner court; and behold, two chambers were in the inner court: one behind the gate that looketh toward the north, turning toward the south; and one behind the gate that was toward the south, looking
45 but toward the north. And he said unto me, "This chamber, which looketh toward the south, [is] for the priests who keep the charge
46 of the house; and the chamber that looketh toward the north, [is] for the priests
