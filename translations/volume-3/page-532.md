ἰσχυρὸς ἦν ὡς δρῦς, καὶ ἐξήρανα τὸν καρπὸν αὐτοῦ ἀπάνωθεν, καὶ
10 τὰς ῥίζας αὐτοῦ ὑποκάτωθεν· καὶ ἐγὼ ἀνήγαγον ὑμᾶς ἐκ γῆς Αἰ-
    γύπτου, καὶ περιήγαγον ὑμᾶς ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ τεσσαράκοντα ἔτη, τοῦ
11 κατακληρονομῆσαι τὴν γῆν τῶν Ἀμοῤῥαίων. Καὶ ἔλαβον ἐκ τῶν
    υἱῶν ὑμῶν εἰς προφήτας, καὶ ἐκ τῶν νεανίσκων ὑμῶν εἰς ἁγια-
12 σμόν· μὴ οὐκ ἔστι ταῦτα υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ; λέγει Κύριος. Καὶ ἐπο-
    τίζετε τοὺς ἡγιασμένους οἶνον, καὶ τοῖς προφήταις ἐνετέλλεσθε
13 λέγοντες· οὐ μὴ προφητεύσητε. Διὰ τοῦτο ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ κυλίω ὑπο-
    κάτω ὑμῶν, ὃν τρόπον κυλίεται ἡ ἅμαξα ἡ γέμουσα καλάμης·
14 καὶ ἀπολεῖται φυγὴ ἐκ δρομέως, καὶ ὁ κραταιὸς οὐ μὴ κρατήσῃ
    τῆς ἰσχύος αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὁ μαχητὴς οὐ μὴ σώσῃ τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ,
15 καὶ ὁ τοξότης οὐ μὴ ὑποστῇ, καὶ ὁ ὀξὺς τοῖς ποσὶν αὐτοῦ οὐ μὴ
16 διασωθῇ, οὐδὲ ὁ ἱππεὺς οὐ μὴ σώσῃ τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὁ κρα-
    ταιὸς οὐ μὴ εὑρήσει τὴν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ ἐν δυναστείαις, ὁ γυμνὸς
    διώξεται ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ, λέγει Κύριος.

ΚΕΦ. Γ΄. III.

1 ἌΚΟΥΣΑΤΕ τὸν λόγον τοῦτον, ὃν ἐλάλησε Κύριος ἐφ’ ἡμᾶς οἶ-
    κος Ἰσραήλ, καὶ κατὰ πάσης φυλῆς, ἧς ἀνήγαγον ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύ-
2 πτου, λέγων· πλὴν ὑμᾶς ἔγνων ἐκ πασῶν τῶν φυλῶν τῆς γῆς, διὰ
3 τοῦτο ἐκδικήσω ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς πάσας τὰς ἁμαρτίας ὑμῶν. Εἰ πορεύ-
4 σονται δύο ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ καθόλου, ἐὰν μὴ γνωρίσωσιν ἑαυτούς; εἰ
    ἐρεύξεται λέων ἐκ τοῦ δρυμοῦ αὐτοῦ, θήραν οὐκ ἔχων; εἰ δώσει
    σκύμνος φωνὴν αὐτοῦ ἐκ τῆς μάνδρας αὐτοῦ καθόλου, ἐὰν μὴ
5 ἁρπάσῃ τί; εἰ πεσεῖται ὄρνεον ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς ἄνευ ἰξευτοῦ; εἰ
6 σχασθήσεται παγὶς ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς ἄνευ τοῦ συλλαβεῖν τι; εἰ
    φωνήσει σάλπιγξ ἐν πόλει, καὶ λαὸς οὐ πτοηθήσεται; εἰ ἔσται
7 κακία ἐν πόλει, ἣν Κύριος οὐκ ἐποίησε; Διότι οὐ μὴ ποιή-
    σῃ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς πρᾶγμα, ἐὰν μὴ ἀποκαλύψῃ παιδείαν αὐτοῦ
8 πρὸς τοὺς δούλους αὐτοῦ τοὺς προφήτας. Λέων ἐρεύξεται, καὶ
    τίς οὐ φοβηθήσεται; Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἐλάλησε, καὶ τίς οὐ προφη-
9 τεύσει; Ἀπαγγείλατε χώραις ἐν Ἀσσυρίοις καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς χώρας
    Αἰγύπτου, καὶ εἴπατε· συνάχθητε ἐπὶ τὸ ὄρος Σαμαρείας, καὶ
    ἴδετε θαυμαστὰ πολλὰ ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῆς, καὶ τὴν καταδυναστείαν
10 τὴν ἐν αὐτῇ· καὶ οὐκ ἔγνω ἃ ἔσται ἐναντίον αὐτῆς, λέγει Κύ-
    ριος, οἱ θησαυρίζοντες ἀδικίαν καὶ ταλαιπωρίαν ἐν ταῖς χώραις

**CHAPTER 2**

**9** ...he was strong as an oak; and I dried up his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.
**10** And I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and led you through the wilderness forty years, that ye might inherit the land of the Amorites.
**11** And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites.
**12** Is it not thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the Lord. But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink, and commanded the prophets, saying, "Prophesy ye not!"
**13** Behold, therefore, I shall press down upon you, by rolling as a wagon doth roll, being laden with chaff.
**14** And flight shall perish from the swift runner, and the mighty man shall not prevail by his strength, and the warrior shall not save his life.
**15** Neither shall the archer stand; and he that is swift of foot shall not be delivered, nor shall the horseman save his life.
**16** And the mighty one shall not find courage in his power; the naked shall flee away in that day, saith the Lord.

**CHAPTER 3**

**1** Hear ye this word that the Lord hath spoken against us, O house of Israel, and against every tribe which I brought up out of the land of Egypt, saying:
**2** "You only have I known of all the tribes of the earth: therefore I will avenge upon you all your sins."
**3** Shall two walk together upon the earth, at all, unless they have known each other?
**4** Shall a lion roar from his thicket, having no prey? Shall a young lion give forth his voice from his lair at all, unless he hath seized something?
**5** Shall a bird fall upon the earth without a fowler? Shall
**6** a snare be set upon the earth without catching anything? Shall a trumpet sound in a city, and the people not be terrified? Shall there be
**7** calamity in a city, which the Lord hath not wrought? For the Lord God shall not do a thing, unless He reveal His counsel
**8** unto His servants the prophets. A lion hath roared, and who shall not fear? The Lord God hath spoken, and who shall not prophesy?
**9** Declare ye in the lands among the Assyrians, and in the lands of Egypt, and say: "Assemble yourselves upon the mountain of Samaria, and behold many wondrous things in the midst thereof, and the oppression
**10** that is within her. And she knew not what should be against her," saith the Lord, "even they that store up injustice and distress in their lands."
