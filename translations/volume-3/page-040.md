ΨΑΛΤΗΡΙΟΝ. ΨΑΛΜ. ΝΔ´. ΝΕ´. ΝϚ´.
δολιότητος οὐ μὴ ἡμισεῦσωσι τὰς ἡμέρας αὐτῶν· ἐγὼ δὲ ἐλπιῶ ἐπὶ δὲ Κύριε.

ΨΑΛΜ. ΝΕ´. LV.

1   Εἰς τὸ τέλος ὑπὲρ τοῦ λαοῦ τοῦ ἀπὸ τῶν ἁγίων μεμακρυσ-
    μένου, τῷ Δαυΐδ εἰς σηλογραφίαν, ὁπότε ἐκράτησαν αὐτὸν οἱ ἀλ-
2   λόφυλοι ἐν Γέθ. ᾿Ελέησόν με ὁ Θεός, ὅτι κατεπάτησέ με ἄνθρω-
3   πος· ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν πολεμῶν ἔθλιψέ με. Κατεπάτησάν με οἱ
    ἐχθροί μου ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν· ὅτι πολλοὶ οἱ πολεμοῦντές με ἀπὸ
4.5 ὕψους. ῾Ημέρας φοβηθήσομαι, ἐγὼ δὲ ἐλπιῶ ἐπὶ σέ. ᾿Εν τῷ Θεῷ
    ἐπαινέσω τοὺς λόγους μου· ἐπὶ τῷ Θεῷ ἤλπισα, οὐ φοβηθήσομαι
6   τί ποιήσει μοι σάρξ. ῞Ολην τὴν ἡμέραν τοὺς λόγους μου ἐβδελύσ-
7   σοντο· κατ᾿ ἐμοῦ πάντες οἱ διαλογισμοὶ αὐτῶν εἰς κακόν. Παρο-
    ικῆσουσι καὶ κατακρύψουσιν· αὐτοὶ τὴν πτέρναν μου φυλάξουσι,
8   καθάπερ ὑπέμειναν τὴν ψυχήν μου. ῾Υπὲρ τοῦ μηδενὸς σώσεις αὐ-
9   τοὺς· ἐν ὀργῇ λαοὺς κατάξεις, ὁ Θεός. Τὴν ζωὴν μου ἐξήγγει-
    λα· σὺ ἔθου τὰ δάκρυά μου ἐνώπιόν σου, ὡς καὶ ἐν τῇ ἐπαγγελίᾳ
10  σου. Τότε ἐπιστρέψουσιν οἱ ἐχθροί μου εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω, ἐν ᾗ ἂν
11  ἡμέρᾳ ἐπικαλέσωμαί σε· ἰδοὺ ἔγνων ὅτι Θεός μου εἶ σύ. ᾿Επὶ τῷ
12  Θεῷ αἰνέσω ῥῆμα· ἐπὶ τῷ Κυρίῳ αἰνέσω λόγον. ᾿Επὶ τῷ Θεῷ
13  ἤλπισα, οὐ φοβηθήσομαι τί ποιήσει μοι ἄνθρωπος. ᾿Εν ἐμοὶ ὁ Θεὸς
14  αἱ εὐχαί σου, ἃς ἀποδώσω αἰνέσεις σοι· ὅτι ἐῤῥύσω τὴν ψυχήν
    μου ἐκ θανάτου, καὶ τοὺς πόδας μου ἐξ ὀλισθήματος, τοῦ εὐαρε-
    στῆσαι ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐν φωτὶ ζώντων.

ΨΑΛΜ. ΝϚ´. LVI.

1   Εἰς τὸ τέλος, μὴ διαφθείρῃς, τῷ Δαυΐδ εἰς σηλογραφίαν, ἐν
    τῷ αὐτὸν ἀποδιδράσκειν ἀπὸ προσώπου Σαοὺλ εἰς τὸ σπήλαιον.
2   ᾿Ελέησόν με ὁ Θεός, ἐλέησόν με· ὅτι ἐπὶ σοὶ πέποιθεν ἡ ψυχή μου,
    καὶ ἐν τῇ σκιᾷ τῶν πτερύγων σου ἐλπιῶ, ἕως οὗ παρέλθῃ ἡ ἀνο-
3   μία. Κεκράξομαι πρὸς τὸν Θεὸν τὸν ὕψιστον, τὸν Θεὸν τὸν εὐερ-
4   γετήσαντά με. Διάψαλμα. ᾿Εξαπέστειλεν ἐξ οὐρανοῦ καὶ ἔσωσέ με,
    ἔδωκεν εἰς ὀνειδος τοὺς καταπατοῦντάς με· ἐξαπέστειλεν ὁ Θεὸς
8   τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ καὶ τὴν ἀλήθειαν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐῤῥύσατο τὴν ψυχήν

### 2. A free and highly literary translation

of deceitfulness shall not live out half their days; but I, for my part, will hope upon [Thee], even O Lord.

**PSALM LV.**

Unto the End, for the people who are far removed from the holy ones; A Michtam of David, when the foreigners laid hold of him in Gath.

2 Have mercy upon me, O God,
for man hath trodden me down;
all the day long he hath oppressed me, waging war.
3 My enemies have trodden me down all the day long;
for many are they that make war against me from on high.
4 In the day when I shall be afraid,
but I, for my part, will hope in Thee.
5 In God will I praise His words;
in God have I hoped;
I will not fear what flesh shall do unto me.
6 All the day long did they abhor my words;
against me all their thoughts are for evil.
7 They shall sojourn and lie in wait;
they themselves shall watch my heel,
even as they laid wait for my soul.
8 Thou shalt bring them to naught;
in wrath shalt Thou cast down the peoples, O God.
9 I have declared my life's [plight];
Thou hast put my tears before Thee,
even as in Thy promise.
10 Then shall my enemies turn back backward,
in whatsoever day I shall call upon Thee;
behold, I have known that Thou art my God.
11 In God will I praise His word;
in the Lord will I praise His saying.
12 In God have I hoped;
I will not fear what man shall do unto me.
13 O God, Thy vows are upon me,
14 which I shall render as praises unto Thee;
for Thou hast delivered my soul from death,
and my feet from stumbling,
that I may be well-pleasing before God
in the light of the living.

**PSALM LVI.**

Unto the End, Destroy Not; A Michtam of David, when he fled from the face of Saul into the cave.

2 Have mercy upon me, O God, have mercy upon me;
for in Thee hath my soul trusted;
and in the shadow of Thy wings will I hope,
until iniquity pass by.
3 I will cry unto God the Most High,
unto God who hath dealt bountifully with me. Selah.
4 He hath sent from heaven, and saved me;
He hath delivered to reproach them that trampled upon me.
God hath sent forth His mercy and His truth,
8 and delivered my soul.
