1 Οὕτως ἔδειξέ μοι Κύριος ὁ Θεός, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐπιγονὴ ἀκρίδων ἐρχομένη ἑωθινή, καὶ ἰδοὺ βροῦχος εἷς, Γὼγ ὁ βασιλεύς.
2 Καὶ ἔσται, ἐὰν συντελέσῃ τοῦ καταφαγεῖν τὸν χόρτον τῆς γῆς, καὶ εἶπα· Κύριε Κύριε, ἵλεως γενοῦ· τίς ἀναστήσει τὸν Ἰακώβ; ὅτι ὀλιγοστός ἐστι· μετανόησον Κύριε ἐπὶ τούτῳ.
3 Καὶ τοῦτο οὐκ ἔσται, λέγει Κύριος.
4 Οὕτως ἔδειξέ μοι Κύριος ὁ Θεός, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐκάλεσε τὴν δίκην ἐν πυρὶ Κύριος, καὶ κατέφαγε τὴν ἄβυσσον τὴν πολλήν, καὶ κατέφαγε τὴν μερίδα.
5 Καὶ εἶπα· Κύριε Κύριε, κόπασον δή· τίς ἀναστήσει τὸν Ἰακώβ; ὅτι ὀλιγοστός ἐστι, μετανόησον Κύριε ἐπὶ τούτῳ.
6 Καὶ τοῦτο οὐ μὴ γένηται, λέγει Κύριος.
7 Οὕτως ἔδειξέ μοι Κύριος, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἀνὴρ ἑστηκὼς ἐπὶ τείχους ἀδαμαντίνου, καὶ ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ ἀδάμας.
8 Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς μέ· τί σὺ ὁρᾷς Ἄμώς; Καὶ εἶπα· ἀδάμαντα. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς μέ· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐντάσσω ἀδάμαντα εἰς μέσον λαοῦ μου Ἰσραήλ, οὐκ ἔτι μὴ προσθήσω τοῦ παρελθεῖν αὐτόν·
9 καὶ ἀφανισθήσονται βωμοὶ τοῦ γέλωτος, καὶ αἱ τελεταὶ τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ ἐξερημωθήσονται, καὶ ἀναστήσομαι ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον Ἰεροβοάμ ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ.
10 Καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν Ἀμασίας ὁ ἱερεὺς Βαιθήλ πρὸς Ἰεροβοὰμ βασιλέα Ἰσραήλ, λέγων· συστροφὰς ποιεῖται κατὰ σοῦ Ἄμὼς ἐν μέσῳ οἴκου Ἰσραήλ, οὐ μὴ δύνηται ἡ γῆ ὑπενεγκεῖν ἅπαντας τοὺς λόγους αὐτοῦ·
11 διότι τάδε λέγει Ἄμὼς· ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ τελευτήσει Ἰεροβοάμ, ὁ δὲ Ἰσραὴλ αἰχμάλωτος ἀχθήσεται ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς αὐτοῦ.
12 Καὶ εἶπεν Ἀμασίας πρὸς Ἄμὼς· ὁ δρῶν, βάδιζε, ἐκχώρησον σοι εἰς γῆν Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐκεῖ καταβίου, καὶ ἐκεῖ προφητεύσεις·
13 εἰς δὲ Βαιθήλ οὐκέτι μὴ προσθῇς τοῦ προφητεῦσαι, ὅτι ἁγίασμα βασιλέως ἐστί, καὶ οἶκος βασιλείας ἐστι.
14 Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Ἄμώς, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς Ἀμασίαν· οὐκ ἤμην προφήτης ἐγώ, οὐδὲ υἱὸς προφήτου, ἀλλ᾽ ἢ αἰπόλος ἤμην καὶ κνίζων συκάμινα·
15 καὶ ἀνέλαβέ με Κύριος ἐκ τῶν προβάτων, καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς μέ· βάδιζε, προφήτευσον ἐπὶ τὸν λαόν μου τὸν Ἰσραήλ.
16 Καὶ νῦν ἄκουε λόγον Κυρίου· σὺ λέγεις· μὴ προφήτευε ἐπὶ τὸν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ οὐ μὴ ὀχλαγωγήσῃς ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον Ἰακώβ·
17 διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Κύριος· ἡ γυνή σου ἐν τῇ πόλει πορνεύσει, καὶ οἱ υἱοί σου καὶ αἱ

**CHAPTER 7**

**1** Thus the Lord God showed unto me; and behold, a swarm of locusts coming in the morning; and behold, there was one destroyer [locust], Gog the king.
**2** And it came to pass, when it had made an end to devour the herbage of the land, then I said, "O Lord, Lord, be merciful! Who shall raise up Jacob? For he is small [in number]. Repent, O Lord, concerning this."
**3** And this shall not be, saith the Lord.
**4** Thus the Lord God showed unto me; and behold, the Lord called for judgment by fire; and it devoured the great deep, and it devoured the portion.
**5** Then I said, "O Lord, Lord, cease now! Who shall raise up Jacob? For he is small [in number]. Repent, O Lord, concerning this."
**6** And this shall by no means come to pass, saith the Lord.
**7** Thus the Lord showed unto me; and behold, a man standing upon a wall of adamant, and in his hand was an adamant plumb-line.
**8** And the Lord said unto me, "What seest thou, Amos?" And I said, "An adamant [plumb-line]." And the Lord said unto me, "Behold, I will set an adamant plumb-line in the midst of My people Israel; I will no longer pass him by."
**9** And the altars of laughter shall be utterly destroyed, and the solemnities of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.
**10** Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent unto Jeroboam the king of Israel, saying, "Amos hath made a conspiracy against thee in the midst of the house of Israel; the land is not able to bear all his words.
**11** For thus Amos saith, 'Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive from his own land.'"
**12** And Amaziah said unto Amos, "O thou seer, get thee gone, and flee unto the land of Judah, and there abide, and there prophesy;
**13** but prophesy no more at Bethel, for it is the king's sanctuary, and it is a house of the kingdom."
**14** Then Amos answered and said unto Amaziah, "I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son; but I was a goatherd, and one who pricked sycamore figs.
**15** And the Lord took me from following the flocks, and the Lord said unto me, 'Go, prophesy unto My people Israel.'
**16** Now therefore hear thou the word of the Lord: Thou sayest, 'Prophesy not against Israel, and make no commotion against the house of Jacob.'
**17** Therefore thus saith the Lord: Thy wife shall be a harlot in the city."
