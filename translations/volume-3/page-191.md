ΚΕΦ. Δ´. IV.

ΚΑΙ ἐπιλήψονται ἑπτὰ γυναῖκες ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἀνθρώπου 1
ἑνός, λέγουσαι· τὸν ἄρτον ἡμῶν φαγόμεθα, καὶ τὰ ἱμάτια ἡμῶν
περιβαλούμεθα· πλὴν τὸ ὄνομα τὸ σὸν κεκλήσθω ἐφ᾽ ἡμᾶς, ἄφελε
τὸν ὀνειδισμὸν ἡμῶν. Τῇ δὲ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἐπιλάμψει ὁ Θεὸς ἐν 2
βουλῇ μετὰ δόξης ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, τοῦ ὑψῶσαι καὶ δοξάσαι τὸ κα-
ταλειφθὲν τοῦ Ἰσραήλ· καὶ ἔσαι τὸ ὑπολειφθὲν ἐν Σιὼν, καὶ 3
τὸ καταλειφθὲν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ· ἅγιοι κληθήσονται πάντες οἱ γρα-
φέντες εἰς ζωὴν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ. Ὅτι ἐκπλυνεῖ Κύριος τὸν ρύπον 4
τῶν υἱῶν καὶ τῶν θυγατέρων Σιὼν, καὶ τὸ αἷμα Ἱερουσαλὴμ, ἐκκα-
θαριεῖ ἐκ μέσου αὐτῶν, ἐν πνεύματι κρίσεως καὶ πνεύματι καύ-
σεως. Καὶ ἥξει, καὶ ἔσαι πᾶς τόπος τοῦ ὄρους Σιὼν, καὶ πάντα 5
τὰ περικύκλῳ αὐτῆς σκιάσει νεφέλη ἡμέρας, καὶ ὡς καπνοῦ καὶ ὡς
φωτὸς πυρὸς καιομένου νυκτὸς, καὶ πάσῃ τῇ δόξῃ Κυρίου σκεπα-
σθήσεται· καὶ ἔσαι εἰς σκιὰν ἡμέρας ἀπὸ καύματος, καὶ ἐν σκέπῃ 6
καὶ ἐν ἀποκρύφῳ ἀπὸ σκληρότητος καὶ ὑετοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. Ε´. V.

῎ΑΣΩ δὴ τῷ ἠγαπημένῳ ἆσμα τοῦ ἀγαπητοῦ μου τῷ ἀμ- 1
πελῶνί μου. Ἀμπελὼν ἐγενήθη τῷ ἠγαπημένῳ ἐν κέρατι, ἐν τόπῳ
πῖον· καὶ φραγμὸν περιέθηκα καὶ ἐχαράκωσα, καὶ ἐφύτευσα ἄμ- 2
πελον Σωρὴκ, καὶ ᾠκοδόμησα πύργον ἐν μέσῳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ προλή-
νιον ὤρυξα ἐν αὐτῷ, καὶ ἔμεινα τοῦ ποιῆσαι σταφυλὴν, ἐποίησε
δὲ ἀκάνθας. Καὶ νῦν, ἄνθρωπος τοῦ Ἰούδα, καὶ οἱ ἐνοικοῦντες 3
ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ, κρίνατε δὴ ἐν ἐμοὶ καὶ ἀναμέσον τοῦ ἀμπελῶ-
νός μου. Τί ποιήσω ἔτι τῷ ἀμπελῶνί μου, καὶ οὐκ ἐποίησα αὐτῷ; 4
διότι ἔμεινα τοῦ ποιῆσαι σταφυλὴν, ἐποίησε δὲ ἀκάνθας. Νῦν 5
δὲ ἀναγγελῶ δὴ ὑμῖν, τί ἐγὼ ποιήσω τῷ ἀμπελῶνί μου· ἀφελῶ
τὸν φραγμὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔσαι εἰς διαρπαγὴν· καὶ καθελῶ τὸν
τοῖχον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔσαι εἰς καταπάτημα· καὶ ἀνήσω τὸν ἀμπε- 6
λῶνά μου, καὶ οὐ μὴ τμηθῇ, οὐδὲ μὴ σκαφῇ, καὶ ἀναβήσεται εἰς
αὐτὸν, ὡς εἰς χέρσον ἄκανθα· καὶ ταῖς νεφέλαις ἐντελοῦμαι, τοῦ
μὴ βρέξαι εἰς αὐτὸν ὑετόν. Ὁ γὰρ ἀμπελὼν Κυρίου Σαβαὼθ 7

## Chapter 4

**1** And in that day shall seven women lay hold of one man, saying:
"We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel;
Only let thy name be called upon us, to take away our reproach."

**2** But in that day shall God shine forth in counsel, with glory upon the earth,
To exalt and to glorify that which is left of Israel;
**3** And it shall be that the remnant in Zion, and the residue in Jerusalem,
All they that are written for life in Jerusalem, shall be called holy.

**4** For the Lord shall wash away the filth of the sons and of the daughters of Zion,
And shall cleanse the blood of Jerusalem from the midst of them,
By the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of burning.
**5** And it shall come to pass, that upon every dwelling place of Mount Zion,
And upon all her surrounding places, a cloud shall cast its shade by day;
And [there shall be] a smoke and the light of a burning fire by night.
And with all the glory of the Lord shall it be covered.
**6** And it shall be for a shade by day from the heat,
And for a shelter and for a hiding place from the storm and from the rain.

## Chapter 5

**1** Let me sing now to my beloved a song of my beloved concerning his vineyard.
A vineyard had my beloved, on a horn, in a most fertile place.
**2** And I hedged it round about, and trenched [it];
And I planted in it a Sorek vine;
And I built a tower in the midst thereof, and also dug a winepress therein.
And I waited for it to bring forth grapes, but it brought forth thorns.
**3** And now, O man of Judah, and ye that dwell in Jerusalem,
Judge now, I pray you, between Me and My vineyard.
**4** What more could I have done to My vineyard, that I have not done to it?
Why, when I waited for it to bring forth grapes, did it bring forth thorns?
**5** Now therefore, I will declare unto you what I will do to My vineyard:
I will take away its hedge, and it shall be utterly wasted;
And I will pull down its wall, and it shall be trodden down.
**6** And I will abandon My vineyard; and it shall not be pruned, neither shall it be dug;
But thorns shall grow up therein, as in a desolate land.
And I will command the clouds, that they rain no rain upon it.
**7** For the vineyard of the Lord of Sabaoth is
