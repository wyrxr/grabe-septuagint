ΝΑΟΥΜ Α΄:

ΚΕΦΑΛΑΙΟΝ. Α΄. Ι.

1 ἈΗΜΜΑ Νινευή· βίβλίον δράσεως Ναοὺμ τοῦ Ἐλκεσαίου.
2 Θεὸς ζηλωτής, καὶ ἐκδικῶν Κύριος, ἐκδικῶν Κύριος, μετὰ θυμοῦ
3 ἐκδικῶν Κύριος τοὺς ὑπεναντίους αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐξαίρων αὐτὸς τοὺς
   ἐχθροὺς αὐτοῦ. Κύριος μακρόθυμος, καὶ μεγάλη ἡ ἰσχὺς αὐτοῦ,
4 καὶ ἀθωῶν οὐκ ἀθωώσει Κύριος· ἐν συντελείᾳ καὶ ἐν συσσεισμῷ
   ἡ ὁδὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ νεφέλαι κονιορτὸς ποδῶν αὐτοῦ· ἀπειλῶν θα-
5 λάσσῃ, καὶ ξηραίνων αὐτήν, καὶ πάντας τοὺς ποταμοὺς ἐξερη-
   μῶν. Ὠλιγώθη ἡ Βασανῖτις, καὶ ὁ Κάρμηλος, καὶ τὰ ἐξανθοῦντα
   τοῦ Λιβάνου ἐξέλιπε. Τὰ ὄρη ἐσείσθησαν ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ οἱ βουνοὶ
6 ἐσαλεύθησαν· καὶ ἀνεστάλη ἡ γῆ ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ, ἢ σύμ-
   πασα καὶ πάντες οἱ κατοικοῦντες ἐν αὐτῇ. Ἀπὸ προσώπου ὀργῆς
   αὐτοῦ τίς ὑποστήσεται; καὶ τίς ἀντιστήσεται ἐν ὀργῇ θυμοῦ
7 αὐτοῦ; ὁ θυμὸς αὐτοῦ τήκει ἀρχάς, καὶ αἱ πέτραι διερρύησαν
   ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ. Χρηστὸς Κύριος τοῖς ὑπομένουσιν αὐτὸν ἐν ἡμέρᾳ θλί-
8 ψεως, καὶ γινώσκων τοὺς εὐλαβουμένους αὐτόν. Καὶ ἐν κατα-
   κλυσμῷ πορείας συντέλειαν ποιήσεται· τοὺς ἐπεγειρομένους καὶ
9 τοὺς ἐχθροὺς αὐτοῦ διώξεται σκότος. Τί λογίζεσθε ἐπὶ τὸν Κύ-
   ριον; συντέλειαν αὐτὸς ποιήσεται, οὐκ ἐκδικήσει δὶς ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ
10 ἐν θλίψει· ὅτι ἕως θεμελίου αὐτῶν χερσωθήσονται, ὡς σμίλαξ
11 περιπλεκομένη βρωθήσεται, καὶ ὡς καλάμη ξηρασίας μεστή. Ἐκ
   σοῦ ἐξελεύσεται λογισμὸς κατὰ τοῦ Κυρίου, πονηρά, βουλευό-
12 μενος ποιήσει ἐναντία. Τάδε λέγει Κύριος· κατάρχων ὑδάτων
   πολλῶν, καὶ οὕτως διασταλήσονται, καὶ ἡ ἀκοή σου οὐκ ἐνακου-
13 σθήσεται ἔτι. Καὶ νῦν συντρίψω τὴν ῥάβδον αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ σοῦ, καὶ
14 τοὺς δεσμούς σου διαρρήξω· καὶ ἐντελεῖται ὑπὲρ σοῦ Κύριος, οὐ
   σπαρήσεται ἐκ τοῦ ὀνόματός σου ἔτι· καὶ ἐξ οἴκου Θεοῦ σου ἐξ-
   ολεθρεύσω τὰ γλυπτά σου καὶ χωνευτὰ θήσομαι ταφήν σου, ὅτι
   ταχεῖς.

NAHUM
CHAPTER I

**1** The oracle of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.

**2** The Lord is a jealous God, and an avenging Lord, an avenging Lord, with wrath.
**3** The Lord avengeth His adversaries, and He visiteth punishment upon His enemies. The Lord is longsuffering, and great is His might;
**4** and the Lord will by no means acquit [the guilty]. His way is in the consummation and in the earthquake, and the clouds are the dust of His feet. He threateneth the sea,
**5** and drieth it up, and maketh desolate all the rivers. Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, and the blossoming [glory] of Lebanon hath failed. The mountains shook before Him, and the hills were made to tremble;
**6** and the earth was restrained from His presence, even all [the earth], and all that dwell therein. Before the face of His wrath, who shall stand? And who shall resist in the fierceness of His anger?
**7** His wrath melteth princes, and the rocks are melted away from Him. The Lord is good to them that wait upon Him in the day of trouble,
**8** and He knoweth them that revere Him. And with an overwhelming flood shall He make a full end [of His enemies]; those that rise up against Him,
**9** and His enemies, shall darkness pursue. What do ye devise against the Lord? He Himself shall make a full end; He shall not take vengeance twice upon the same thing in affliction.
**10** For even to their foundation shall they be laid waste; as an intertwining bramble shall they be consumed, and as stubble full of dryness.
**11** From thee shall go forth an evil counsel against the Lord, devising to do contrary things.
**12** Thus saith the Lord: [Though they be] rulers over many waters, yet so shall they be dispersed; and thy report shall be heard no more.
**13** And now will I break his rod from thee, and I will burst asunder thy bonds.
**14** And the Lord shall appoint concerning thee, [that] no seed of thy name shall be sown any more; and from the house of thy God will I utterly destroy thy carved images and thy molten images; I will make thy grave, for thou art swift.
