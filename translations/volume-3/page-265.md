ἀνατολῶν ἡλίου τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ τὸ ἔνδοξον· ἥξει γὰρ ὡς ποταμὸς βίαιος ἡ ὀργὴ παρὰ Κυρίου, ἥξει μετὰ θυμοῦ. Καὶ ἥξει 20
ἕνεκεν Σιὼν ὁ ῥυόμενος, καὶ ἀποστρέψει ἀσεβείας ἀπὸ Ἰακώβ,
εἶπε Κύριος. Καὶ αὕτη αὐτοῖς ἡ παρ’ ἐμοῦ διαθήκη, εἶπε Κύ- 21
ριος· τὸ πνεῦμα τὸ ἐμόν, ὃ ἔστιν ἐπὶ σοί, καὶ τὰ ῥήματά μου,
ἃ ἔδωκα εἰς τὸ στόμα σου, οὐ μὴ ἐκλίπῃ ἐκ τοῦ στόματός σου,
καὶ ἐκ τοῦ στόματος τοῦ σπέρματός σου, καὶ ἐκ τοῦ στόματος τοῦ σπέρματος τοῦ σπέρματός σου, εἶπε Κύριος ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν
καὶ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα.

**ΚΕΦ. Ξ´. LX.**

ΦΩΤΙΖΟΥ, φωτίζου Ἱερουσαλήμ, ἥκει γάρ σου τὸ φῶς, καὶ 1
ἡ δόξα Κυρίου ἐπὶ σὲ ἀνατέταλκεν. Ὅτι ἰδοὺ σκότος καλύψει 2
γῆν, καὶ γνόφος ἐπ’ ἔθνη, ἐπὶ δὲ σὲ φανήσεται Κύριος, καὶ ἡ
δόξα αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ σὲ ὀφθήσεται. Καὶ πορεύσονται βασιλεῖς τῷ φω- 3
τί σου, καὶ ἔθνη τῇ λαμπρότητι τῆς ἀνατολῆς σου. Ἄρον κύ- 4
κλῳ τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς σου, καὶ ἴδε πάντα συνηγμένα τὰ τέκνα
σου· ἰδοὺ ἥκασι πάντες οἱ υἱοί σου μακρόθεν, καὶ αἱ θυγατέ-
ρές σου ἐπ’ ὤμων ἀρθήσονται. Τότε ὄψῃ, καὶ χαρήσῃ, καὶ φο- 5
βηθήσῃ, καὶ ἐκστήσῃ τῇ καρδίᾳ, ὅτι μεταβαλεῖ εἰς σὲ πλοῦ-
τος θαλάσσης, καὶ ἐθνῶν καὶ λαῶν, καὶ ἥξουσι σοὶ ἀγέλαι κα- 6
μήλων, καὶ καλύψουσί σε κάμηλοι Μαδιὰμ καὶ Γαιρά· πάντες
ἐκ Σαβὰ ἥξουσι φέροντες χρυσίον, καὶ λίβανον οἴσουσι, καὶ λί-
θον τίμιον, καὶ τὸ σωτήριον Κυρίου εὐαγγελιοῦνται. Καὶ πάντα 7
τὰ πρόβατα Κηδὰρ συναχθήσονται, καὶ οἱ κριοὶ Ναβαιὼθ ἥξουσι
σοι, καὶ ἀνενεχθήσεται δεκτὰ ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριόν μου, καὶ ὁ
οἶκος τῆς προσευχῆς μου δοξασθήσεται. Τίνες οἵδε ὡς νεφέλαι 8
πέτανται, καὶ ὡς περιστεραὶ σὺν νεοσσοῖς; Ἐμὲ νῆσοι ὑπέμει- 9
ναν, καὶ πλοῖα Θαρσεῖς ἐν πρώτοις, ἀγαγεῖν τὰ τέκνα σου μα-
κρόθεν, καὶ τὸν ἄργυρον καὶ τὸν χρυσὸν αὐτῶν μετ’ αὐτῶν,
διὰ τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου τὸ ἅγιον, καὶ διὰ τὸ τὸν ἅγιον τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ
ἔνδοξον εἶναι. Καὶ οἰκοδομήσουσιν υἱοὶ ἀλλογενεῖς τὰ τείχη σου, 10
καὶ οἱ βασιλεῖς αὐτῶν παραστήσονται σοι· διὰ γὰρ ὀργήν μου
ἐπάταξά σε, καὶ διὰ ἐλεός μου ἠγάπησά σε. Καὶ ἀνοιχθήσον- 11
ται αἱ πύλαι σου διαπαντός, ἡμέρας καὶ νυκτὸς οὐ κλεισθήσον-
ται, εἰσαγαγεῖν πρὸς σὲ δύναμιν ἐθνῶν, καὶ βασιλεῖς αὐτῶν ἀγαμένους.

#### Chapter 59

**19** ...from the rising of the sun His glorious name;
    For His wrath shall come as a violent river from the Lord;
    it shall come with fury.
**20** And the Redeemer shall come for Zion's sake,
    and He shall turn away impieties from Jacob,
    saith the Lord.
**21** And this shall be My covenant with them, saith the Lord:
    My Spirit that is upon thee,
    and My words which I have put into thy mouth,
    shall not depart out of thy mouth,
    nor out of the mouth of thy seed,
    nor out of the mouth of the seed of thy seed,
    saith the Lord, from henceforth and forever.

#### Chapter 60

**1** Be enlightened, be enlightened, O Jerusalem,
    for thy light is come,
    and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.
**2** For behold, darkness shall cover the earth,
    and gloom upon the nations;
    but upon thee shall the Lord appear,
    and His glory shall be seen upon thee.
**3** And kings shall walk by thy light,
    and nations by the brightness of thy dawning.
**4** Lift up thine eyes round about,
    and behold all thy children gathered together:
    behold, all thy sons come from afar,
    and thy daughters shall be carried upon shoulders.
**5** Then shalt thou see, and shalt rejoice,
    and shalt be afraid, and thy heart shall be enlarged,
    for the wealth of the sea,
    and of nations, and of peoples shall turn to thee;
**6** and droves of camels shall come unto thee,
    and the camels of Midian and Gaira shall cover thee;
    all from Sheba shall come, bearing gold,
    and they shall bring frankincense, and precious stone,
    and they shall proclaim the salvation of the Lord.
**7** And all the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together,
    and the rams of Nebaioth shall come unto thee;
    and acceptable [offerings] shall be brought up upon My altar,
    and the house of My prayer shall be glorified.
**8** Who are these that fly as clouds,
    and as doves with their young?
**9** For Me have the islands waited,
    and ships of Tarshish among the first,
    to bring thy children from afar,
    with their silver and their gold with them,
    for the sake of the holy name of the Lord,
    and for the Holy One of Israel to be glorious.
**10** And the sons of foreigners shall build thy walls,
    and their kings shall attend upon thee;
    for in My wrath I smote thee,
    but in My mercy I loved thee.
**11** And thy gates shall be open continually;
    by day and by night shall they not be shut,
    to bring unto thee the power of the nations,
    and their kings led [in procession].
