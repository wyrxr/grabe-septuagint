σεται τὰ ὀστᾶ ταῦτα; καὶ εἶπα, Κύριε Κύριε, σὺ ἐπίστῃ ταῦτα.
4 Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς με· προφήτευσον ἐπὶ τὰ ὀστᾶ ταῦτα, καὶ ἐρεῖς αὐ-
τοῖς· τὰ ὀστᾶ τὰ ξηρά, ἀκούσατε λόγον Κυρίου. Τάδε λέγει Κύ-
5 ριος Κύριος τοῖς ὀστέοις τούτοις· Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ φέρω εἰς ὑμᾶς πνεῦμα
6 ζωῆς, καὶ δώσω ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς νεῦρα, καὶ ἀνάξω ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς σάρκα, καὶ
ἐκτενῶ ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς δέρμα, καὶ δώσω πνεῦμά μου εἰς ὑμᾶς, καὶ ζή-
7 σεσθε, καὶ γνώσεσθε διότι ἐγώ εἰμι Κύριος. Καὶ ἐπροφήτευσα,
καθὼς ἐνετείλατό μοι Κύριος, καὶ ἐγένετο φωνὴ ἐν τῷ ἐμὲ προ-
φητεύειν, καὶ ἰδοὺ σεισμός, καὶ προσήγαγε τὰ ὀστᾶ ἑκάτερον πρὸς
8 τὴν ἁρμονίαν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἴδον· καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐπ’ αὐτὰ νεῦρα καὶ σάρ-
κες ἀνεφύοντο, καὶ ἀνέβαινεν ἐπ’ αὐτὰ δέρμα ἐπάνω, καὶ πνεῦμα
9 οὐκ ἦν ἐν αὐτοῖς. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς με· προφήτευσον υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου,
προφήτευσον ἐπὶ τὸ πνεῦμα, καὶ εἰπὸν τῷ πνεύματι· τάδε λέγει
Κύριος Κύριος· ἐλθὲ ἐκ τῶν τεσσάρων πνευμάτων (τοῦ οὐρανοῦ)
ἐλθὲ τὸ πνεῦμα, καὶ ἐμφύσησον εἰς τοὺς νεκροὺς τούτους, καὶ
10 ζησάτωσαν. Καὶ ἐπροφήτευσα, καθὼς ἐνετείλατό μοι, καὶ εἰσῆλ-
θεν εἰς αὐτοὺς τὸ πνεῦμα ζωῆς, καὶ ἔζησαν, καὶ ἔστησαν ἐπὶ τῶν
ποδῶν αὐτῶν, συναγωγὴ μεγάλη σφόδρα σφόδρα. Καὶ ἐλάλησε
11 Κύριος πρὸς με, λέγων· υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, τὰ ὀστᾶ ταῦτα πᾶς οἶκος
Ἰσραήλ ἐστιν, καὶ αὐτοὶ λέγουσι, ξηρὰ γέγονε τὰ ὀστᾶ ἡμῶν,
ἀπόλωλεν ἡ ἐλπὶς ἡμῶν, διαπεφωνήκαμεν ἑαυτοῖς. Διὰ τοῦτο
12 προφήτευσον, καὶ εἰπὸν πρὸς αὐτούς· τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναὶ Κύριος·
ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἀνοίγω ὑμῶν τὰ μνήματα, καὶ ἀνάξω ὑμᾶς ἐκ τῶν μνη-
μάτων ὑμῶν λαός μου, καὶ εἰσάξω ὑμᾶς εἰς τὴν γῆν τοῦ Ἰσραήλ·
13 καὶ γνώσεσθε ὅτι ἐγὼ εἰμι Κύριος, ἐν τῷ ἀνοῖξαί με τοὺς τάφους
ὑμῶν, τοῦ ἀναγαγεῖν με ὑμᾶς ἐκ τῶν ταφῶν ὑμῶν, τὸν λαόν μου.
14 Καὶ δώσω πνεῦμά μου εἰς ὑμᾶς, καὶ ζήσεσθε, καὶ θήσομαι ὑμᾶς ἐπὶ
τὴν γῆν ὑμῶν, καὶ γνώσεσθε ὅτι ἐγὼ Κύριος· λελάληκα καὶ ποιήσω,
15 λέγει Κύριος Κύριος. Καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς με, λέγων·
16 υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, λάβε σεαυτῷ ῥάβδον, καὶ γράψον ἐπ’ αὐτὴν τὸν
Ἰούδαν, καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ τοὺς προσκειμένους πρὸς αὐτόν·
καὶ ῥάβδον δευτέραν λήψῃ σεαυτῷ, καὶ γράψεις αὐτὴν τῷ Ἰωσήφ,
ῥάβδον Ἐφραίμ, καὶ πάντας τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ τοὺς προσκειμένους
17 πρὸς αὐτόν, καὶ συνάψεις αὐτὰς προσκολλήλας σεαυτῷ, εἰς ῥάβδον
μίαν τοῦ δῆσαι αὐτάς, καὶ ἔσονται εἰς ἑνικὰ ἐν τῇ χειρί σου. Καὶ
18 ἔσται, ὅταν λέγωσι πρὸς σὲ οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ λαοῦ σου, λέγοντες· οὐκ

4 "Shall these bones live?" And I said, "O Lord God, Thou knowest these things."
Then He said unto me: "Prophesy upon these bones, and thou shalt say unto them:
'O ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord!'"
5 Thus saith the Lord God unto these bones:
"Behold, I bring forth into you the Spirit of life;
6 and I will lay sinews upon you, and I will bring up flesh upon you,
and I will spread skin over you; and I will put My Spirit into you,
and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am the Lord."
7 And I prophesied as the Lord commanded me;
and there was a voice as I prophesied, and behold, a quaking;
and the bones drew near, each to its proper joint.
8 And I looked, and behold, upon them the sinews and the flesh grew,
and the skin came up over them; but there was no spirit within them.
9 And He said unto me: "Prophesy, son of man, prophesy unto the Spirit,
and say unto the Spirit: 'Thus saith the Lord God:
Come from the four spirits [of the heaven], O Spirit;
come, and breathe upon these dead, that they may live!'"
10 And I prophesied as He commanded me;
and the Spirit of life entered into them, and they lived,
and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding, exceeding great assembly.
11 And the Lord spake unto me, saying:
"Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel;
and they themselves say, 'Our bones are dried up, and our hope is perished;
we are utterly cut off from ourselves.'
12 Therefore prophesy, and say unto them: 'Thus saith Adonai the Lord:
Behold, I open your graves, and I will bring you up out of your graves,
O My people, and I will bring you into the land of Israel;
13 and ye shall know that I am the Lord,
when I open your graves, [and] when I bring you up out of your graves,
O My people.
14 And I will put My Spirit into you, and ye shall live,
and I will set you upon your own land;
and ye shall know that I the Lord have spoken it, and will perform it,'
saith the Lord God."
15 And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying:
16 "Son of man, take unto thyself a stick,
and write upon it: 'For Judah, and for the children of Israel
that cleave unto him';
and take unto thyself another stick,
and write upon it: 'For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim,
and for all the house of Israel that cleave unto him.'
17 And join them one to another, making them stick fast unto thyself,
into one stick to bind them; and they shall be as singular things in thy hand.
18 And it shall come to pass, when the children of thy people speak unto thee,
saying: 'Not...'"
