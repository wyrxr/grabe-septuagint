ΚΕΦ. ΛΔ΄.
οὐκέτι ἔσονται ἐν προνομῇ τοῖς ἔθνεσι, καὶ τὰ θηρία τῆς γῆς οὐκέτι μὴ φάγωσιν αὐτούς· καὶ κατοικήσουσιν ἐν ἐλπίδι, καὶ οὐκ
29 ἔσται ὁ ἐκφοβῶν αὐτούς. Καὶ ἀναστήσω αὐτοῖς φυτὸν εἰρήνης, καὶ οὐκέτι ἔσονται ἀπολλύμενοι λιμῷ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, καὶ ὀνειδισμὸν ἐθνῶν οὐ μὴ ἐνέγκωσιν ἔτι,
30 καὶ γνώσονται ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς αὐτῶν, καὶ αὐτοὶ λαός μου· οἶκος τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, λέγει Κύριος Κύριος.
31 Καὶ ὑμεῖς πρόβατά μου, καὶ πρόβατα τοῦ ποιμνίου μου ἐστέ, καὶ ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν, λέγει Κύριος Κύριος.

ΚΕΦ. ΛΕ΄. XXXV.

1.2 ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς με, λέγων· υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, ἐπίστρεψον τὸ πρόσωπόν σου ἐπὶ τὸ ὄρος Σηείρ, καὶ προφήτευσον ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸ,
3 καὶ εἰπὸν αὐτῷ· τάδε λέγει Κύριος Κύριος· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐπὶ σὲ, ὄρος Σηείρ, καὶ ἐκτενῶ τὴν χεῖρά μου ἐπὶ
4 σὲ, καὶ δώσω σε ἔρημον, καὶ ἐρημωθήσῃ, καὶ ἐν ταῖς πόλεσί σου ἐρημίαν ποιήσω, καὶ σὺ ἔρημος ἔσῃ, καὶ γνώσῃ, ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι
5 Κύριος. Ἀντὶ τοῦ γενέσθαι σε ἐχθρὰν αἰώνιον, καὶ ἐνεκάθισας τῷ οἴκῳ Ἰσραὴλ δόλῳ, ἐν καιρῷ ἐχθρῶν ἐν χειρὶ μαχαίρας
6 ἐν καιρῷ θλίψεως αὐτῶν, ἐν καιρῷ ἀδικίας, ἐπ᾽ ἐσχάτων. Διὰ τοῦτο ζῶ ἐγὼ, λέγει Κύριος Κύριος, εἰ μὴν εἰς αἷμα ἥμαρτες,
7 καὶ αἷμά σε διώξεται. Καὶ δώσω τὸ ὄρος Σηεὶρ εἰς ἔρημον, καὶ
8 ἠρημωμένον, καὶ ἀπολῶ ἀπ᾽ αὐτοῦ ἀνθρώπους καὶ κτήνη, καὶ ἐμπλήσω τῶν τραυματιῶν σου τοὺς βουνούς σου καὶ πάσας τὰς φάραγγάς σου, καὶ ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς πεδίοις σου τετραυματισμένοι
9 μαχαίρᾳ πεσοῦνται ἐν σοί. Καὶ ἐρημίαν αἰώνιον θήσομαί σε, καὶ αἱ πόλεις σου οὐ μὴ κατοικηθῶσιν ἔτι, καὶ γνώσῃ ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι
10 Κύριος. Διότι εἶπας· τὰ δύο ἔθνη, καὶ αἱ δύο χῶραι ἐμαὶ ἔσονται, καὶ κληρονομήσω αὐτάς, καὶ ὁ Κύριος ἐκεῖ ἐστι.
11 Διὰ τοῦτο ζῶ ἐγὼ, λέγει Κύριος Κύριος, καὶ ποιήσω ἐν σοὶ κατὰ τὴν ἔχθραν σου, καὶ κατὰ τὸν ζῆλόν σου, ὃν ἐποίησας ἐκ τοῦ μεμισήκεναι σε ἐν αὐτοῖς, καὶ γνωσθήσομαί σοι, ἡνίκα ἐὰν κρινῶ σε,
12 καὶ γνώσῃ ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι Κύριος· ἤκουσα τῆς φωνῆς τῶν βλαφημιῶν σου, ὅτι εἶπας, τὰ ὄρη Ἰσραὴλ ἔρημα ἡμῖν δέδοται εἰς κατάβρωμα,
13 καὶ ἐμεγαλορημόνησας ἐπ᾽ ἐμὲ τῷ στόματί σου, καὶ ἐπλήθυνας ἐπ᾽ ἐμὲ λόγους σου, (καὶ) ἐγὼ ἤκουσα,

**Chapter 34**

...and they shall no more be a prey to the nations;
neither shall the beasts of the earth devour them any more.
And they shall dwell in hope,
29 and none shall make them afraid. And I will raise up for them a plant of peace;
and they shall no more be consumed by famine in the land,
neither shall they bear the reproach of the nations any more.
30 And they shall know that I am the Lord their God,
and that they are My people, the house of Israel,
saith the Lord, the Lord.
31 And ye are My sheep, and the sheep of My flock;
and I am the Lord your God,
saith the Lord, the Lord.

**Chapter 35**

1 And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
2 "Son of man, set thy face against Mount Seir,
and prophesy against it,
3 and say unto it: Thus saith the Lord, the Lord:
Behold, I am against thee, O Mount Seir,
and I will stretch forth My hand upon
4 thee, and I will make thee desolate,
and thou shalt be laid waste;
and in thy cities will I cause desolation,
and thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord.
5 Forasmuch as thou hast been an eternal enemy,
and hast plotted against the house of Israel with deceit,
in the time of [their] enemies, by the hand of the sword,
6 in the time of their tribulation, in the time of [their] iniquity,
even to the uttermost. Therefore, as I live,
saith the Lord, the Lord, surely, since thou hast sinned unto bloodshed,
7 even blood shall pursue thee.
And I will make Mount Seir a desolation, and
8 laid waste; and I will destroy from it man and beast.
And I will fill thy mountains with thy wounded,
and all thy valleys, and in all thy plains, the wounded
9 shall fall by the sword within thee.
And I will make thee an eternal desolation,
and thy cities shall no more be inhabited;
and thou shalt know that I am the Lord.
10 Because thou hast said: 'The two nations and the two lands shall be Mine,
and I will inherit them,' and, 'The Lord is there.'
11 Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord, the Lord,
I will act in thee according to thy hatred,
and according to thy jealousy, which thou hast wrought
because thou didst hate them;
and I shall make Myself known to thee, when I shall judge thee.
12 And thou shalt know that I am the Lord;
for I have heard the voice of thy blasphemies,
in that thou hast said, 'The mountains of Israel are given unto us for a devouring,'
13 and thou hast spoken boastfully against Me with thy mouth,
and thou hast multiplied thy words against Me, [yea,] I have heard."
