ξης αὐτοῦ ἐπ᾿ ἄκρου τοῦ ὄρους τοῦ ὑψηλοῦ· ὡς πρόδρομος σύχου, ὁ ἰδὼν αὐτό, πρὶν ἢ εἰς τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ λαβεῖν, θελήσει
5 αὐτὸ καταπιεῖν. Τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἔσται Κύριος Σαβαὼθ ὁ στέφανος τῆς ἐλπίδος, ὁ πλακεὶς τῆς δόξης, τῷ καταληφθέντι
6 τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ καταληφθήσονται ἐπὶ πνεύματι κρίσεως τῷ καθημένῳ ἐπὶ κρίσιν, καὶ ἰσχὺν κωλυόντων ἀνελεῖν.
7 Οὗτοι γὰρ οἴνῳ πεπλανημένοι εἰσίν· ἐπλανήθησαν διὰ τὸ σίκερα, ἱερεὺς καὶ προφήτης ἐξέστησαν διὰ τὸ σίκερα, κατεπόθησαν διὰ τὸν οἶνον, ἐσείσθησαν ἀπὸ τῆς μέθης τοῦ σίκερα, ἐπλανήθησαν τοῦτό ἐστι φάντασμα.
8 ᾿Αρὰ ἔδεται τρίτην τὴν βουλήν, αὕτη γὰρ ἡ βουλὴ ἕνεκεν πλεονεξίας.
9 Τίνι ἀνηγγείλαμεν κακά, καὶ τίνι ἀνηγγείλαμεν ἀγγελίαν; οἱ ἀπογεγαλακτισμένοι ἀπὸ γάλακτος, οἱ ἀπεσπασμένοι ἀπὸ μαστοῦ,
10 θλίψιν ἐπὶ θλίψιν προσδέχου, ἐλπῖδα ἐπ᾿ ἐλπίδι, ἔτι μικρόν, ἔτι μικρόν, διὰ φαυλισμῶν χειλέων,
11 διὰ γλώσσης ἑτέρας, ὅτι λαλήσουσι τῷ λαῷ τούτῳ, λέγοντες αὐτοῖς,
12 τοῦτο τὸ ἀνάπαυμα τῷ πεινῶντι, καὶ τοῦτο τὸ σύντριμμα, καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησαν ἀκούειν.
13 Καὶ ἔσται αὐτοῖς τὸ λόγιον Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ, θλίψις ἐπὶ θλίψιν, ἐλπὶς ἐπ᾿ ἐλπίδι, ἔτι μικρόν, ἔτι μικρόν, ἵνα πορευθῶσι καὶ πέσωσιν εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω, καὶ κινδυνεύσουσι, καὶ συντριβήσονται, καὶ ἁλώσονται.
14 Διὰ τοῦτο ἀκούσατε λόγον Κυρίου ἄνδρες τεθλιμμένοι, καὶ ἄρχοντες τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου τοῦ ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ,
15 ὅτι εἴπατε, ἐποιήσαμεν διαθήκην μετὰ τοῦ ᾅδου, καὶ μετὰ τοῦ θανάτου συνθήκας· καταίγις φερομένη ἐὰν παρέλθῃ, οὐ μὴ ἔλθῃ ἡμῖν· ἐθήκαμεν ψεῦδος τὴν ἐλπίδα ἡμῶν, καὶ τῷ ψεύδει σκεπασθησόμεθα.
16 Διὰ τοῦτο οὕτως λέγει Κύριος Κύριος· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐμβάλλω εἰς τὰ θεμέλια Σιὼν λίθον πολυτελῆ, ἐκλεκτόν, ἀκρογωνιαῖον, ἔντιμον εἰς τὰ θεμέλια αὐτῆς, καὶ ὁ πιστεύων ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ οὐ μὴ καταισχυνθῇ.
17 Καὶ θήσω κρίσιν εἰς ἐλπίδα, ἡ δὲ ἐλεημοσύνη μου εἰς σταθμούς, καὶ οἱ πεποιθότες μάτην ψεύδει.
18 ὅτι οὐ μὴ παρέλθῃ ὑμᾶς καταιγίς, μὴ καὶ ἀφέλῃ ὑμῶν τὴν διαθήκην τοῦ θανάτου, καὶ ἡ ἐλπὶς ὑμῶν ἡ πρὸς τὸν ᾅδην οὐ μὴ ἐμμείνῃ· καταιγὶς φερομένη ἐὰν ἐπέλθῃ, ἔσεσθε αὐτῇ εἰς καταπάτημα.
19 Ὅταν παρέλθῃ, λήψεται ὑμᾶς· ὅτι κατὰ πρωὶ πρωὶ παρελεύσεται ἡμέρας, καὶ ἐν νυκτὶ ἔσται ἐλπὶς πονηρά·
20 μάθετε ἀκούειν στενοχωρούμενοι· οὐ δυνάμεθα μάχεσθαι, αὐτοὶ δὲ ἀσθενοῦμεν τοῦ ἡμᾶς συναχθῆναι.
21 Ὥσπερ ὄρος.

**Chapter 28**

**4** ...of his glory, on the top of the high mountain; as an early fig, which he that seeth it, ere he take it into his hand, shall desire to swallow it.

**5** In that day shall the Lord Sabaoth be the crown of hope, and the intertwined [wreath] of glory, unto the remnant of His people.

**6** And they shall be seized by a spirit of judgment for him that sitteth in judgment, and by strength restraining those who would slay.

**7** For these are erred by wine; they have been led astray through strong drink. Priest and prophet have stumbled through strong drink; they have been swallowed up by wine; they have reeled from the intoxication of strong drink; they have been led astray; this is a phantom.

**8** Arah shall consume the third counsel, for this counsel is by reason of covetousness.

**9** To whom have we declared evils? And to whom have we declared a message? To those weaned from milk, to those drawn from the breast.

**10** Receive thou affliction upon affliction, hope upon hope, yet a little, yet a little, through the babblings of lips,

**11** through another tongue; for they shall speak unto this people, saying unto them,

**12** "This is the rest for him that hungers, and this is the crushing." Yet would they not hear.

**13** And the word of the Lord God shall be unto them: affliction upon affliction, hope upon hope, yet a little, yet a little; that they may go forth and fall backward, and be in peril, and be broken, and be captured.

**14** Therefore hear ye the word of the Lord, ye men of affliction, and ye rulers of this people who are in Jerusalem;

**15** Because ye have said, "We have made a covenant with Hades, and with Death a pact; if a sweeping torrent pass by, it shall not come upon us." We have made our hope a lie, and by falsehood shall we be covered.

**16** Therefore thus saith the Lord, the Lord: "Behold, I lay in the foundations of Zion a stone most precious, a chosen [stone], a cornerstone, honorable in its foundations; and he that believeth on it shall not be put to shame."

**17** And I will set judgment for hope, and My mercy for scales; and those who trusted in vain [by] falsehood.

**18** For the sweeping torrent shall not pass you by, lest it also take away from you the covenant of death, and your hope toward Hades shall not remain. When the sweeping torrent comes, ye shall be a trampling unto it.

**19** When it passes by, it shall take you. For morning by morning shall it pass by [through the] days, and in the night there shall be evil hope.

**20** Learn ye to hear, [ye who are] distressed, saying: "We cannot fight, but we ourselves are weak to be gathered."

**21** As a mountain...
