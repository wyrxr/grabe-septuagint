ΚΕΦ. ΛΓʹ. ΙΕΖΕΚΙΗΛ 1387
ἀπὸ τῆς ἀνομίας αὐτοῦ, καὶ ποιήσῃ κρῖμα καὶ δικαιοσύνην, ἐν
αὐτοῖς αὐτὸς ζήσεται. Καὶ τοῦτό ἐστιν ὃ εἴπατε, οὐκ εὐθεῖα ἡ 20
ὁδὸς Κυρίου· ἕκαστον κατὰ τὰς ὁδοὺς αὐτοῦ κρινῶ ὑμᾶς, οἶκος
Ἰσραήλ, λέγει Κύριος. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ δωδεκάτῳ ἔτει, ἐν τῷ 21
δωδεκάτῳ μηνί, πέμπτῃ τοῦ μηνὸς τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας ἡμῶν, ἦλθεν
ὁ ἀνασωθεὶς πρὸς μὲ ἀπὸ Ἱερουσαλήμ, λέγων· ἑάλω ἡ πόλις.
Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐπ’ ἐμὲ χεὶρ Κυρίου ἑσπέρας πρὶν ἐλθεῖν αὐτὸν πρὸς 22
μὲ, καὶ ἤνοιξε τὸ στόμα μου, ἕως ἦλθε πρὸς μὲ τὸ πρωΐ· καὶ ἀνοιχθέν
μου τὸ στόμα οὐ συνεσχέθη ἔτι. Καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυ- 23
ρίου πρὸς μὲ, λέγων· υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, οἱ κατοικοῦντες τὰς ἐρημω- 24
μένας ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, λέγουσιν· εἷς ἦν Ἀβραὰμ, καὶ
κατέσχε τὴν γῆν, καὶ ἡμεῖς πλείους ἐσμὲν, ἡμῖν δέδοται ἡ γῆ
εἰς κατάσχεσιν. Διὰ τοῦτο εἰπὲ πρὸς αὐτούς· οὕτως εἶπεν Ἀδω- 25
ναὶ Κύριος· ἐπὶ τῷ αἵματι φάγεσθε, καὶ ὀφθαλμοὺς ὑμῶν λή-
ψεσθε πρὸς εἴδωλα ὑμῶν, καὶ αἷμα ἐκχεῖτε· καὶ τὴν γῆν κληρο-
νομήσετε; Ἔστητε ἐπὶ τῇ ῥομφαίᾳ ὑμῶν, ἐποιήσατε βδέλυγμα, 26
καὶ ἀνὴρ τὴν γυναῖκα τοῦ πλησίον αὐτοῦ ἐμιάνατε, καὶ τὴν γῆν
κληρονομήσετε; Οὕτως διὰ τοῦτο εἰπὸν αὐτοῖς· τάδε λέγει Κύ- 27
ριος Κύριος· Ζῶ ἐγώ, εἰ μὴν οἱ ἐν ταῖς ἡρημωμέναις μαχαίραις
πεσοῦνται, καὶ οἱ ἐπὶ προσώπου τοῦ πεδίου τοῖς θηρίοις τοῦ ἀ-
γροῦ δοθήσονται εἰς κατάβρωμα, καὶ τοὺς ἐν ταῖς τετειχισμέναις,
καὶ τοὺς ἐν τοῖς σπηλαίοις θανάτῳ ἀποκτενῶ. Καὶ δώσω τὴν γῆν 28
ἔρημον, καὶ ἀπολεῖται ἡ ὕβρις τῆς ἰσχύος αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐρημωθήσον-
ται τὰ ὄρη Ἰσραὴλ διὰ τὸ μὴ εἶναι διαπορευόμενον. Καὶ γνώσονται, 29
ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι Κύριος· καὶ ποιήσω τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν ἔρημον, καὶ ἐρη-
μωθήσεται διὰ πάντα τὰ βδελύγματα αὐτῶν ἃ ἐποίησαν. Καὶ σὺ 30
υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ λαοῦ σου οἱ λαλοῦντες περὶ σοῦ παρὰ τὰ
τείχη καὶ ἐν τοῖς πυλῶσι τῶν οἰκιῶν, καὶ λαλοῦσιν ἄνθρωπος τῷ
ἀδελφῷ αὐτοῦ, λέγοντες· συνέλθωμεν, καὶ ἀκούσομεν τὰ ἐκπορευό-
μενα παρὰ Κυρίου. Καὶ ἔρχονται πρὸς σὲ, ὡς συμπορεύεται λαὸς, 31
καὶ κάθηνται ἐναντίον σου ὁ λαός μου, καὶ ἀκούουσι τὰ ῥήματά σου,
καὶ αὐτὰ οὐ μὴ ποιήσωσιν, ὅτι ψεῦδος ἐν τῷ στόματι αὐτῶν, καὶ
ὀπίσω τῶν μιασμάτων αὐτῶν ἡ καρδία αὐτῶν ἐστί. Καὶ γίνῃ αὐ- 32
τοῖς ὡς φωνὴ ψαλτηρίου ἡδυφώνου, εὐαρμόστου, καὶ ἀκούσονται τὰ
ῥήματά σου, οὐ μὴ ποιήσουσιν αὐτά. Καὶ ἔσται ἡνίκα ἐὰν ἔλθῃ, ἐροῦ- 33
σιν, ἰδοὺ ἥκει, καὶ γνώσονται, ὅτι προφήτης ἦν ἐν μέσω αὐτῶν.

**Chapter 33**

**19** ...from his iniquity, and do that which is lawful and right, in these he himself shall live.
**20** And this is that which ye have said, "The way of the Lord is not equal." I shall judge each of you according to his ways, O house of Israel, saith the Lord.
**21** And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the fifth day of the month of our captivity, that one who had escaped came unto me from Jerusalem, saying, "The city is taken!"
**22** And the hand of the Lord was upon me in the evening, before he that had escaped came unto me; and He opened my mouth, until he came unto me in the morning; and when my mouth was opened, it was no longer closed.
**23** And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
**24** "Son of man, they that dwell in the waste places upon the land of Israel speak, saying, 'Abraham was but one, and he possessed the land; but we are many, and the land is given unto us for a possession.'"
**25** Therefore say unto them, "Thus saith Adonai the Lord: Ye eat upon the blood, and ye lift up your eyes unto your idols, and ye shed blood; and shall ye possess the land?
**26** Ye stand upon your sword, ye have committed abomination, and every man hath defiled his neighbor's wife; and shall ye possess the land?"
**27** Therefore thus say unto them: "Thus saith the Lord, the Lord: As I live, surely they that are in the waste places shall fall by the sword; and they that are upon the face of the field shall be given unto the beasts of the field to be devoured; and them that are in the walled [cities], and them that are in the caves, will I slay with death.
**28** And I will make the land desolate, and the pride of her strength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, because there shall be none passing through.
**29** And they shall know that I am the Lord; and I will make their land desolate, and it shall be made waste, because of all their abominations which they have committed.
**30** And thou, son of man, the children of thy people who speak concerning thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and a man speaketh to his brother, saying, 'Come ye, and let us hear the words that come forth from the Lord.'
**31** And they come unto thee, as a people cometh together, and My people sit before thee, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them; for falsehood is in their mouth, and their heart goeth after their defilements.
**32** And thou art unto them as the voice of a sweet-sounding, well-tuned psaltery; and they hear thy words, but they will not do them.
**33** And when it shall come to pass, (for behold, it cometh,) then shall they say, 'Lo, it is come!' and they shall know that a prophet hath been among them."
