ΚΕΦ. ΚΕ΄.
7 ὑμᾶς· καὶ οὐκ εἰσηκούσατέ μου, φησὶ Κύριος, ὅπως παροργίσητέ μου ἐν τοῖς ἔργοις τῶν χειρῶν ὑμῶν εἰς κακὸν ὑμῖν.
8 Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Κύριος· ἐπειδὴ οὐκ ἐπιστεύσατε τοῖς λόγοις μου,
9 Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἀποστέλλω, καὶ λήψομαι πάσας τὰς πατριάς (ἀπὸ) βορρᾶ, καὶ πρὸς Ναβουχοδονόσορ βασιλέα Βαβυλῶνος τὸν δοῦλόν μου, καὶ ἀξῶ αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ταύτην, καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας αὐτήν, καὶ ἐπὶ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη τὰ κύκλῳ αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐξερημώσω αὐτούς, καὶ δώσω αὐτοὺς εἰς ἀφανισμόν, καὶ εἰς συριγμόν, καὶ εἰς ὀνειδισμὸν αἰώνιον.
10 Καὶ ἀπολῶ ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν φωνὴν χαρᾶς, καὶ φωνὴν εὐφροσύνης. φωνὴν νυμφίου, καὶ φωνὴν νύμφης, ὀσμὴν μύρου, καὶ φῶς λύχνου.
11 Καὶ ἔσται πᾶσα ἡ γῆ εἰς ἀφανισμόν, καὶ εἰς ἐρήμωσιν, καὶ δουλεύσουσιν ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι τούτοις τῷ βασιλεῖ Βαβυλῶνος, ἑβδομήκοντα ἔτη, καὶ ἐν τῷ
12 συμπληρωθῆναι τὰ ἑβδομήκοντα ἔτη, ἐκδικήσω ἐπὶ τὸν βασιλέα Βαβυλῶνος καὶ ἐπὶ τὸ ἔθνος ἐκεῖνο, φησὶ Κύριος, τὰς ἀνομίας αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν Χαλδαίων, καὶ θήσομαι αὐτοὺς εἰς ἀφανισμὸν αἰώνιον.
13 καὶ ἐπάξω ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ἐκείνην ἅπαντας τοὺς λόγους μου, οὓς ἐλάλησα κατ᾿ αὐτῆς, πάντα τὰ γεγραμμένα ἐν τῷ βιβλίῳ τούτῳ, ἃ ἐπροφήτευσεν Ἱερεμίας προφήτης
14 κατὰ πάντων τῶν ἐθνῶν· ὅτι ἐδούλευσαν ἐν αὐτοῖς, καίγε δουλώσονται γὰρ καὶ αὐτοὺς ἔθνη πολλὰ καὶ βασιλεῖς μεγάλοι, καὶ ἀνταποδώσω αὐτοῖς κατὰ τὰ ἔργα αὐτῶν, καὶ κατὰ τὴν πονηρίαν τῶν ἐπιτηδευμάτων ὑμῶν.
34 Ὡς ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς Ἱερεμίαν τὸν προφήτην περὶ τῆς Αἰλὰμ ἐν ἀρχῇ βασιλείας Σεδεκίου βασιλέως Ἰούδα, λέγων·
35 Τάδε λέγει Κύριος τῶν δυνάμεων· ἰδοὺ συνετρίβη τὸ τόξον Αἰλάμ, ἀρχὴ δυναστείας αὐτῶν.
36 Καὶ ἐπάξω ἐπὶ Αἰλὰμ τέσσαρας ἀνέμους ἐκ τῶν τεσσάρων ἄκρων τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ διασπερῶ αὐτοὺς ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς ἀνέμοις τούτοις, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ἔθνος ὃ οὐχ ἥξει ἐκεῖ· οἱ ἐξωσμένοι Αἰλάμ.
37 Καὶ ποιήσω αὐτοὺς ἐναντίον τῶν ἐχθρῶν αὐτῶν, τῶν ζητούντων τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπάξω ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς κατὰ τὴν ὀργὴν τοῦ θυμοῦ μου, φησὶ Κύριος· καὶ ἐξαποστελῶ ὀπίσω αὐτῶν τὴν μάχαιράν μου, ἕως τοῦ ἐξαναλῶσαι αὐτούς.
38 Καὶ θήσω τὸν θρόνον μου ἐν Αἰλάμ, καὶ ἐξαποστελῶ ἐκεῖθεν βασιλέα καὶ μεγιστάνας, καὶ ἔσται ἐπ᾿ ἐσχάτου τῶν ἡμερῶν, ἀποστρέψω τὴν
39 αἰχμαλωσίαν Αἰλάμ, λέγει Κύριος.

**Jeremiah 25**
**7** your own hurt; yet ye have not hearkened unto Me, saith the Lord, that ye might provoke Me to anger with the works of your hands, to your own hurt.
**8** Therefore thus saith the Lord: Because ye have not believed My words,
**9** behold, I will send and take all the families [from the] north, and [I will send them] to Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, My servant, and I will bring them against this land, and against those who dwell therein, and against all the nations that are round about it; and I will utterly destroy them, and I will give them over to desolation, and to a hiss, and to an everlasting reproach.
**10** And I will destroy from them the voice of joy, and the voice of gladness; the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride; the scent of myrrh, and the light of the lamp.
**11** And all the land shall be given over to desolation, and to a wasteland; and they shall serve among these nations the king of Babylon for seventy years. And at the
**12** completion of the seventy years, I will take vengeance upon the king of Babylon, and upon that nation, saith the Lord, for their iniquities, and upon the land of the Chaldeans; and I will make them an everlasting desolation.
**13** And I will bring upon that land all My words, which I have spoken against it, even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah the prophet hath prophesied
**14** against all the nations. For they have served among them, and indeed, many nations and great kings shall enslave them; and I will recompense them according to their works, and according to the wickedness of your doings.
**34** The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah, the king of Judah, saying:
**35** Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Behold, the bow of Elam is broken, the beginning of their might.
**36** And I will bring upon Elam four winds from the four ends of heaven, and I will scatter them among all these winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcast of Elam shall not come.
**37** And I will make them to be broken before their enemies, and before those that seek their life; and I will bring upon them the fierceness of My wrath, saith the Lord; and I will send after them My sword, until I have consumed them.
**38** And I will set My throne in Elam, and from thence I will send forth a king and magnates; and it shall be in the latter days, I will turn back the
**39** captivity of Elam, saith the Lord.
