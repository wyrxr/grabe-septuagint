ΚΕΦ. Ζ΄. VII.
1 Τί περισσὸν τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ; ὅτι τίς οἶδε τί ἀγαθὸν τῷ ἀνθρώ-
πῳ ἐν τῇ ζωῇ (αὐτοῦ) ἀριθμὸν ἡμερῶν ζωῆς ματαιότητος αὐτοῦ;
καὶ ἐποίησεν αὐτὰς ἐν σκιᾷ· ὅτι τίς ἀπαγγελεῖ τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ, τί
ἔσται ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ ὑπὸ τὸν ἥλιον; (καὶ καθὼς ἔσται, τίς ἀπαγγελεῖ
2 αὐτῷ;) Ἀγαθὸν ὄνομα ὑπὲρ ἔλαιον ἀγαθόν, καὶ ἡμέρα τοῦ
3 θανάτου ὑπὲρ ἡμέραν γενέσεως αὐτοῦ. Ἀγαθὸν τὸ πορευθῆναι εἰς
οἶκον πένθους ἢ τὸ πορευθῆναι εἰς οἶκον πότου· καθότι τοῦτο τὸ
τέλος παντὸς ἀνθρώπου, καὶ ὁ ζῶν δώσει (ἀγαθὸν) εἰς καρδίαν
4 αὐτοῦ. Ἀγαθὸν θυμὸς ὑπὲρ γέλωτα· ὅτι ἐν κακίᾳ προσώπου ἀγα-
5 θυνθήσεται καρδία. Καρδία σοφῶν ἐν οἴκῳ πένθους, καὶ καρδία
6 ἀφρόνων ἐν οἴκῳ εὐφροσύνης. Ἀγαθὸν τὸ ἀκοῦσαι ἐπιτίμησιν σο-
7 φοῦ ὑπὲρ ἄνδρα ἀκούοντα ἆσμα ἀφρόνων. Ὅτι ὡς φωνὴ τῶν ἀκαν-
θῶν ὑπὸ τὸν λέβητα, οὕτως ὁ γέλως τῶν ἀφρόνων· καί γε τοῦ-
8 το ματαιότης. Ὅτι ἡ συκοφαντία περιφέρει σοφόν, καὶ ἀπολλύει
9 τὴν καρδίαν εὐτονίας αὐτοῦ. Ἀγαθὴ ἐσχάτη λόγου ὑπὲρ ἀρχὴν
10 αὐτοῦ· ἀγαθὸν μακρόθυμος ὑπὲρ ὑψηλὸν πνεύματι. Μὴ σπεύσης
ἐν πνεύματί σου τοῦ θυμοῦσθαι· ὅτι θυμὸς ἐν κόλπῳ ἀφρόνων ἀνα-
11 παύσεται. Μὴ εἴπῃς· τί ἐγένετο ὅτι αἱ ἡμέραι αἱ πρότερον ἦσαν
ἀγαθαὶ ὑπὲρ ταύτας; ὅτι οὐκ ἐν σοφίᾳ ἐπηρώτησας περὶ τούτου.
12 Ἀγαθὴ σοφία μετὰ κληροδοσίας, καὶ περίσσεια τοῖς θεωροῦσι τὸν
13 ἥλιον. Ὅτι ἐν σκιᾷ αὐτῆς ἡ σοφία ὡς σκιὰ τοῦ ἀργυρίου, καὶ
14 περίσσεια γνώσεως τῆς σοφίας ζωοποιήσει τὸν παρ᾿ αὐτῆς. Ἴδε
τὰ ποιήματα τοῦ Θεοῦ· ὅτι τίς δυνήσεται τοῦ κοσμῆσαι ὃν ἂν ὁ
15 Θεὸς διαστρέψῃ αὐτόν; Ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ἀγαθωσύνης ζῆθι ἐν ἀγαθῷ,
καὶ ἰδε ἐν ἡμέρᾳ κακίας· ἴδε καί γε τοῦτο σύμφωνον τούτῳ ἐποίη-
σεν ὁ Θεός, περὶ λαλιᾶς ἵνα μὴ εὕρῃ ἄνθρωπος ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ μη-
16 δέν. Σὺν πάντα ἴδον ἐν ἡμέραις ματαιότητός μου· ἔστι δίκαιος
ἀπολλύμενος ἐν δικαίῳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔστιν ἀσεβὴς μένων ἐν κακίᾳ
17 αὐτοῦ. Μὴ γίνου δίκαιος πολύ, καὶ μὴ σοφίζου περισσά, μήποτε
18 ἐκπλαγῇς· μὴ ἀσεβήσῃς πολύ, καὶ μὴ γίνου σκληρός, ἵνα μὴ ἀπο-
19 θάνῃς ἐν οὐ καιρῷ σου. Ἀγαθὸν τὸ ἀντέχεσθαί σε ἐν τούτῳ, καί
γε ἀπὸ τούτου μὴ ἀνῆς τὴν χεῖρά σου· ὅτι ὁ φοβούμενος τὸν Θεὸν
20 ἐξελεύσεται τὰ πάντα. Ἡ σοφία βοηθήσει τῷ σοφῷ ὑπὲρ δέκα ἐξου-

**CHAPTER 7**

**1** What advantage hath man? For who knoweth what is good for man in his life,
    [even for] the number of the days of his vain life? For He hath made them in a shadow.
    For who shall declare unto man what shall be after him under the sun?
    (And as it shall be, who shall declare it unto him?)
**2** A good name is better than a fragrant ointment;
    and the day of death is better than the day of one’s birth.
**3** It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting;
    for this is the end of all men, and the living shall give [good counsel] unto his heart.
**4** Sorrow is better than laughter;
    for by the sadness of the countenance the heart shall be made better.
**5** The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning;
    but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.
**6** It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise,
    than for a man to hear the song of fools.
**7** For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of fools;
    and verily, this also is vanity.
**8** For oppression corrupteth the wise,
    and destroyeth the heart of his resolve.
**9** Better is the end of a matter than the beginning thereof;
    and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.
**10** Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry;
    for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.
**11** Say not, "What hath come to pass, that the former days were better than these?"
    For thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this.
**12** Wisdom is good with an inheritance,
    and there is advantage to them that behold the sun.
**13** For in her shadow, wisdom is as the shadow of silver;
    yet the abundance of the knowledge of wisdom shall quicken him that possesseth it.
**14** Behold the works of God!
    For who can make straight that which God hath made crooked?
**15** In the day of good, live in good; and consider in the day of evil:
    behold, even this hath God made to accord with that, concerning discourse,
    so that man may find nothing after him.
**16** All things have I seen in the days of my vanity:
    there is a righteous man that perisheth in his righteousness,
    and there is a wicked man that remaineth in his wickedness.
**17** Be not righteous overmuch, neither make thyself over wise; lest thou be overwhelmed.
    Be not wicked overmuch, neither be thou harsh; lest thou die before thy time.
**18** It is good that thou shouldest lay hold of this,
    and from that also withhold not thy hand;
    for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all.
**19** Wisdom shall help the wise more than ten [men of] authority—
