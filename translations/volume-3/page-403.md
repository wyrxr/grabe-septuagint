αὔλῆς τῆς ἐξωτέρας, ὡς φωνὴ Θεοῦ Σαδδαὶ λαλοῦντος. Καὶ ἐγένετο 6
ἐν τῷ ἐντέλλεσθαι αὐτὸν τῷ ἀνδρὶ τῷ ἐνδεδυκότι τὴν στολὴν τὴν ἁγίαν, λέγων, Λάβε πῦρ ἐκ μέσου τῶν τροχῶν ἐκ μέσου τῶν Χερουβείμ, καὶ εἰσῆλθε, καὶ ἔστη ἐχόμενος τῶν τροχῶν. Καὶ ἐξέτεινεν ὁ 7
Χεροὺβ τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ εἰς μέσον τοῦ πυρὸς τοῦ ὄντος ἐν μέσῳ τῶν Χερουβείμ, καὶ ἔλαβε, καὶ ἔδωκεν εἰς τὰς χεῖρας τοῦ ἐνδεδυκότος τὴν στολὴν τὴν ἁγίαν, καὶ ἔλαβε, καὶ ἐξῆλθε. Καὶ ἴδον τὰ Χερουβεὶμ 8
ὁμοίωμα χειρῶν ἀνθρώπων ὑποκάτωθεν τῶν πτερύγων αὐτῶν. Καὶ 9
ἴδον, καὶ ἰδοὺ τροχοὶ τέσσαρες εἰστήκεισαν ἐχόμενοι τῶν Χερουβείμ· τροχὸς εἷς ἐχόμενος τοῦ Χερουβ τοῦ ἑνός· καὶ τροχὸς εἷς ἐχόμενος τοῦ Χερουβ τοῦ ἑνός· καὶ ἡ ὄψις τῶν τροχῶν, ὡς ὄψις λίθου ἄνθρακος. Καὶ ἡ ὄψις αὐτῶν ὁμοίωμα ἐν τοῖς τέσσαρσιν, ὃν τρόπον 10
ὅταν ἡ τροχὸς ἐν μέσῳ τροχοῦ. Ἐν τῷ πορεύεσθαι αὐτά, εἰς τὰ τέσσαρα 11
μέρη αὐτῶν ἐπορεύοντο, οὐκ ἐπέστρεφον ἐν τῷ πορεύεσθαι αὐτά· ὅτι εἰς ἓν ἂν τόπον ἐπέβλεψεν ἡ ἀρχὴ ἡ μία, ἐπορεύοντο, καὶ οὐκ ἐπέστρεφον ἐν τῷ πορεύεσθαι αὐτά. Καὶ πᾶσαι αἱ σάρκες αὐτῶν, καὶ οἱ 12
νῶτοι αὐτῶν, καὶ αἱ χεῖρες αὐτῶν, καὶ αἱ πτέρυγες αὐτῶν, καὶ οἱ τροχοὶ πλήρεις ὀφθαλμῶν κυκλόθεν τοῖς τέσσαρσι τροχοῖς αὐτῶν. Τοῖς δὲ τροχοῖς τούτοις ἐπεκλήθη Γελγέλ· Καὶ τέσσαρα πρόσωπα 13.14
τῷ ἑνί· τὸ πρόσωπον τοῦ ἑνὸς πρόσωπον Χερουβ, καὶ τὸ πρόσωπον τοῦ δευτέρου πρόσωπον ἀνθρώπου, καὶ τὸ πρόσωπον τοῦ τρίτου πρόσωπον λέοντος, καὶ τὸ τέταρτον πρόσωπον ἀετοῦ. Καὶ ἐπῆραν τὰ 15
Χερουβίμ· τοῦτο τὸ ζῶον ὃ εἶδον ἐπὶ τοῦ ποταμοῦ τοῦ Χοβάρ. Καὶ 16
ἐν τῷ πορεύεσθαι τὰ Χερουβίμ, ἐπορεύοντο καὶ οἱ τροχοί, καὶ οὗτοι ἐχόμενοι αὐτῶν· καὶ ἐν τῷ ἐξαίρειν τὰ Χερουβίμ τὰς πτέρυγας αὐτῶν τοῦ μετεωρίζεσθαι ἀπὸ τῆς Γῆς, οὐκ ἐπέστρεφον οἱ τροχοὶ αὐτῶν, καίγε αὐτοὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ἐχόμενα αὐτῶν. Ἐν τῷ ἐστᾶναι αὐτά, εἰστήκεισαν· 17
καὶ ἐν τῷ μετεωρίζεσθαι αὐτά, ἐμετεωρίζοντο μετ᾽ αὐτῶν· διότι πνεῦμα ζωῆς ἐν αὐτοῖς ἦν. Καὶ ἐξῆλθε δόξα Κυρίου ἀπὸ τοῦ αἰθρίου 18
τοῦ οἴκου, καὶ ἐπέβη ἐπὶ τὰ Χερουβίμ, καὶ ἀνέλαβον τὰ Χερουβίμ 19
τὰς πτέρυγας αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐμετεωρίσθησαν ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς ἐνώπιον ἐμοῦ, ἐν τῷ ἐξελθεῖν αὐτά, καὶ οἱ τροχοὶ ἐχόμενοι αὐτῶν· καὶ ἔστησαν ἐπὶ τὰ πρόθυρα τῆς πύλης οἴκου Κυρίου τῆς ἀπέναντι, καὶ δόξα (Κυρίου) Θεοῦ Ἰσραὴλ ἦν ἐπ᾽ αὐτῶν ὑπεράνω.

### Chapter 10

**6** outer court, as the voice of God Almighty speaking. And it came to pass, when He commanded the man clothed in the holy garment, saying, "Take fire from between the wheels, from between the Cherubim," that he went in and stood beside the wheels.
**7** And the Cherub stretched forth his hand into the midst of the fire that was in the midst of the Cherubim, and took [it], and gave [it] into the hands of him that was clothed in the holy garment; and he took [it], and went out.
**8** And I saw in the Cherubim the likeness of the hands of men under their wings.
**9** And I looked, and behold, four wheels stood by the Cherubim; one wheel by one Cherub, and one wheel by the other Cherub. And the appearance of the wheels was as the appearance of a carbuncle stone.
**10** And their appearance was a likeness in the four, in such manner as when a wheel is within a wheel.
**11** When they went, they went toward their four quarters; they turned not as they went. For to whatsoever place the one head looked, they followed, and turned not as they went.
**12** And all their flesh, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels were full of eyes round about them, even their four wheels.
**13** And these wheels were called Galgal.
**14** And four faces had the one [creature]: the face of the one was the face of a Cherub, and the face of the second was the face of a man, and the face of the third was the face of a lion, and the fourth face was the face of an eagle.
**15** And the Cherubim lifted themselves up. This is the living creature which I saw by the river Chebar.
**16** And when the Cherubim went, the wheels went also, [being] by them; and when the Cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, their wheels turned not from beside them, nor did the Cherubim themselves turn aside from those [wheels] that were beside them.
**17** When they stood, they stood; and when they lifted themselves up, they lifted themselves up with them; for the spirit of life was in them.
**18** And the glory of the Lord went forth from the threshold of the House, and stood upon the Cherubim.
**19** And the Cherubim lifted up their wings, and were lifted up from the earth before mine eyes, when they went forth, and the wheels [were] by them; and they stood at the threshold of the gate of the Lord’s House, which looketh eastward; and the glory of [the] Lord God of Israel was over them above.
