### Micah
#### Chapter 3

**11** saying, Is not the Lord in our midst? No evil shall come upon us.
**12** Therefore, because of you, Zion shall be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall be as a watchman's hut for fruit, and the mountain of the House as a dense thicket.

#### Chapter 4

**1** And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord shall be made manifest, ready upon the tops of the mountains; and it shall be lifted up
**2** above the hills. And peoples shall hasten unto it, and many nations shall go unto it, and shall say, Come, let us ascend unto the mountain of the Lord, and into the house of the God of Jacob. And they shall show us His way, and we shall walk in His paths; for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
**3** And He shall judge among many peoples, and shall rebuke strong nations even unto a far-off land. And they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning hooks. And no longer shall nation lift up
**4** sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. But each man shall rest beneath his own vine, and each man beneath his own fig tree; and none shall make them afraid, for the mouth of the Lord Almighty hath spoken these things.
**5** For all the peoples shall walk, each man in his own way; but we shall walk in the Name of the Lord our God forever, and beyond.
**6** In that day, saith the Lord, I will gather her that is crushed, and her that is cast out will I receive, and them whom I have cast away.
**7** And I will make her that is crushed a remnant, and her that is cast out a strong nation. And the Lord shall reign over them in Mount Zion from now and unto eternity.
**8** And thou, O tower of the flock, O drought-stricken daughter Zion, unto thee shall it come, yea, the first dominion shall enter, even a kingdom from Babylon for the daughter of Jerusalem.
**9** And now, why didst thou know evils? Was there no king for thee? Or hath thy counsel perished, that pangs have seized
**10** thee as of one giving birth? Labour and be strong, O daughter of Zion, as one giving birth; for now shalt thou go forth from the city, and thou shalt dwell in the plain, and thou shalt come even unto Babylon. Thence shall He deliver thee, and thence
**11** shall the Lord thy God redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies. And now have many nations been gathered against thee, saying, We shall rejoice,
**12** and our eyes shall gaze upon Zion. But they knew not

ΚΕΦ. Γ΄.
11 λέγοντες· οὐχὶ Κύριος ἐν ἡμῖν ἐστιν ; οὐ μὴ ἐπέλθῃ ἐφ’ ἡμᾶς τὰ
12 κακά. Διὰ τοῦτο δί᾽ ὑμᾶς Σιὼν ὡς ἀγρὸς ἀροτριαθήσεται, καὶ
Ἱερουσαλὴμ εἰς ὀπωροφυλάκιον ἔσται, καὶ τὸ ὄρος τοῦ οἴκου εἰς
ἄλσος δρυμοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. Δ΄. IV.

1 ΚΑΙ ἔσται ἐπ᾽ ἐσχάτων τῶν ἡμερῶν ἐμφανὲς τὸ ὄρος τοῦ Κυ-
ρίου, ἕτοιμον ἐπὶ τὰς κορυφὰς τῶν ὀρέων, καὶ μετεωρισθήσεται
2 ὑπεράνω τῶν βουνῶν. καὶ σπεύσουσιν πρὸς αὐτὸ λαοί, καὶ πορεύ-
σονται πρὸς αὐτὸ ἔθνη πολλὰ καὶ ἐροῦσι, δεῦτε ἀναβῶμεν εἰς τὸ
ὄρος τοῦ Κυρίου, καὶ εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Θεοῦ Ἰακώβ. καὶ δείξου-
σιν ἡμῖν τὴν ὁδὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ πορευσόμεθα ἐν ταῖς τρίβοις αὐτοῦ·
ὅτι ἐκ Σιὼν ἐξελεύσεται νόμος, καὶ λόγος Κυρίου ἐξ Ἱερουσαλήμ.
3 καὶ κρινεῖ ἀναμέσον λαῶν πολλῶν, καὶ ἐλέγξει ἔθνη ἰσχυρὰ ἕως
εἰς γῆν μακράν. Καὶ κατακόψουσι τὰς ῥομφαίας αὐτῶν εἰς ἄρο-
τρα, καὶ τὰς ζιβύνας αὐτῶν εἰς δρέπανα, καὶ οὐκέτι οὐ μὴ ἄρῃ
4 ἔθνος ἐπ᾽ ἔθνος ῥομφαίαν, καὶ οὐ μὴ μάθωσιν ἔτι πολεμεῖν. Καὶ
ἀναπαύσεται ἕκαστος ὑποκάτω ἀμπέλου αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἕκαστος ὑπο-
κάτω συκῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ὁ ἐκφοβῶν, διότι τὸ στόμα Κυ-
5 ρίου παντοκράτορος ἐλάλησε ταῦτα. Ὅτι πάντες οἱ λαοὶ πορεύ-
σονται ἕκαστος τὴν ὁδὸν αὐτοῦ, ἡμεῖς δὲ πορευσόμεθα ἐν ὀνόματι
6 Κυρίου Θεοῦ ἡμῶν εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, καὶ ἐπέκεινα. Ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ
ἐκείνῃ, συνάξω τὴν συντετριμμένην, λέγει Κύριος, καὶ τὴν ἀπω-
7 σμένην εἰσδέξομαι, καὶ οὓς ἀπωσάμην. Καὶ θήσομαι τὴν συντε-
τριμμένην εἰς ὑπόλειμμα, καὶ τὴν ἀπωσμένην εἰς ἔθνος ἰσχυρόν,
καὶ βασιλεύσει Κύριος ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς ἐν ὄρει Σιὼν ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν καὶ
8 ἕως εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα· καὶ σὺ πύργος ποιμνίου αὐχμώδης, θυγάτηρ
Σιών, ἐπὶ σὲ ἥξει, καὶ εἰσελεύσεται ἡ ἀρχὴ ἡ πρώτη βασιλεία ἐκ
9 Βαβυλῶνος τῇ θυγατρί Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ νῦν ἵνατί ἔγνως κακά;
μὴ βασιλεὺς οὐκ ἦν σοι; ἢ ἡ βουλὴ σου ἀπώλετο, ὅτι κατεκρά-
10 τησαν σε ὠδῖνες ὡς τικτούσης; ὠδινε καὶ ἀνδρίζου θύγατερ Σιὼν
ὡς τίκτουσα· διότι νῦν ἐξελεύσῃ ἐκ πόλεως, καὶ κατασκηνώσεις
ἐν πεδίῳ, καὶ ἥξεις ἕως Βαβυλῶνος· ἐκεῖθεν ῥύσεταί σε, καὶ ἐκεῖ-
11 θεν λυτρώσεταί σε Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου ἐκ χειρὸς ἐχθρῶν σου. Καὶ
νῦν ἐπισυνήχθη ἐπὶ σὲ ἔθνη πολλά, οἱ λέγοντες, ἐπιχαρούμεθα,
12 καὶ ἐπόψονται ἐπὶ Σιὼν οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ ἡμῶν. Καὶ αὐτοὶ οὐκ ἔγνω-
