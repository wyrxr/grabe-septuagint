ριος ὁ Θεὸς αὐτῶν πρὸς αὐτούς, καὶ ἐφοβήθη ὁ λαὸς ἀπὸ προ-
σώπου Κυρίου. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἄγγαιος ἄγγελος Κυρίου ἐν ἀγγέλοις 13
Κυρίου τῷ λαῷ· ἐγώ εἰμι μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν, λέγει Κύριος. Καὶ ἐξήγειρε 14
Κύριος τὸ πνεῦμα Ζοροβάβελ τοῦ Σαλαθιὴλ ἐκ φυλῆς Ἰούδα, καὶ
τὸ πνεῦμα Ἰησοῦ τοῦ Ἰωσεδὲκ τοῦ ἱερέως τοῦ μεγάλου, καὶ
τὸ πνεῦμα τῶν καταλοίπων παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ· καὶ εἰσῆλθον, καὶ
ἐποίουν τὰ ἔργα ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ Κυρίου παντοκράτορος Θεοῦ αὐτῶν.

ΚΕΦ. Βʹ. ΙΙ.

Τῇ τετράδι καὶ εἰκάδι τοῦ μηνὸς τοῦ ἔκτου, τῷ δευτέρῳ ἔτει, 1
ἐπὶ Δαρείου τοῦ βασιλέως, τῷ ἑβδόμῳ μηνί, μιᾷ καὶ εἰκάδι τοῦ
μηνός, ἐλάλησε Κύριος ἐν χειρὶ Ἀγγαίου τοῦ προφήτου, λέγων·
εἰπὸν δὴ πρὸς Ζοροβάβελ τὸν τοῦ Σαλαθιὴλ ἐκ φυλῆς Ἰούδα, καὶ 2
πρὸς Ἰησοῦν τὸν τοῦ Ἰωσεδὲκ τὸν ἱερέα τὸν μέγαν, καὶ πρὸς
πάντας τοὺς καταλοίπους τοῦ λαοῦ, λέγων· τίς ἐξ ὑμῶν, ὃς εἶδε 3
τὸν οἶκον τοῦτον ἐν τῇ δόξῃ αὐτοῦ τῇ ἔμπροσθεν; καὶ πῶς ὑμεῖς
βλέπετε αὐτὸν νῦν καθὼς οὐχ ὑπάρχοντα ἐνώπιον ὑμῶν; Καὶ νῦν 4
κατίσχυε Ζοροβάβελ, λέγει Κύριος, καὶ κατίσχυε Ἰησοῦ ὁ τοῦ Ἰω-
σεδὲκ ὁ ἱερεὺς ὁ μέγας, καὶ κατισχυέτω πᾶς ὁ λαὸς τῆς γῆς,
λέγει Κύριος, καὶ ποιεῖτε· διότι ἐγώ εἰμι μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν εἰμι, λέγει Κύριος
παντοκράτωρ· καὶ ὁ λόγος μου ὃν διεθέμην ὑμῖν ἐξελθόντων ὑμῶν
ἐκ τῆς Αἰγύπτου, καὶ τὸ πνεῦμά μου ἐφέστηκεν ἐν μέσῳ ὑμῶν· 5
θαρσεῖτε. Διότι τάδε λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ· ἔτι ἅπαξ ἐγὼ 6
σείσω τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ τὴν γῆν, καὶ τὴν ξηράν, καὶ συσείσω 7
πάντα τὰ ἔθνη, καὶ ἥξει τὰ ἐκλεκτὰ πάντων τῶν ἐθνῶν· καὶ πλη-
ρώσω τὸν οἶκον τοῦτον δόξης, λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ. Ἐμὸν 8
τὸ ἀργύριον, καὶ ἐμὸν τὸ χρυσίον, λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ· διότι 9
μεγάλη ἔσται ἡ δόξα τοῦ οἴκου τούτου ἡ ἐσχάτη ὑπὲρ τὴν πρώ-
την, λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ, καὶ εἰρήνην ψυχῆς εἰς περι-
᾿ποίησιν παντὶ τῷ κτίζοντι, τοῦ ἀναστῆσαι τὸν ναὸν τοῦτον. Τε- 10
τράδι καὶ εἰκάδι, μηνὶ τῷ ἐνάτῳ ἔτους δευτέρου ἐπὶ Δαρείου, ἐγέ-
νετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς Ἀγγαῖον τὸν προφήτην, λέγων· τάδε 11
λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ, ἐπερώτησον δὴ τοὺς ἱερεῖς νόμον, 12
λέγων· ἐὰν λάβῃ ἄνθρωπος κρέας ἅγιον ἐν τῷ ἄκρῳ τοῦ ἱματίου
αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἅψηται τὸ ἄκρον τοῦ ἱματίου αὐτοῦ ἄρτου, ἢ ἐψήμα-
τος, ἢ οἴνου, ἢ ἐλαίου, ἢ παντὸς βρώματος, εἰ ἁγιασθήσεται;

**14** And the Lord stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, of the tribe of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and wrought the work in the house of the Lord Almighty, their God.

CHAPTER II.

**1** On the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month, in the second year, in the reign of Darius the king, in the seventh month, on the twenty-first day of the month, the word of the Lord came by the hand of Haggai the prophet, saying:
**2** "Speak now unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, of the tribe of Judah, and unto Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and unto all the remnant of the people, saying:
**3** 'Who among you is he that saw this house in its former glory? And how do ye now behold it as though it were naught before your eyes?'"
**4** "And now, be strong, O Zerubbabel," saith the Lord; "and be strong, O Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest; and let all the people of the land be strong," saith the Lord, "and do [the work]; for I am with you, I am [with you]," saith the Lord Almighty: "and My word which I covenanted with you when ye came forth out of Egypt, and My Spirit, standeth in your midst.
**5** Be of good courage!"
**6** For thus saith the Lord Almighty: "Yet once more, I will shake the heaven and the earth, and the dry land,
**7** and I will shake all the nations; and the choicest [things] of all the nations shall come; and I will fill this house with glory," saith the Lord Almighty.
**8** "Mine is the silver, and Mine is the gold," saith the Lord Almighty.

**10** On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came unto Haggai the prophet, saying:
**11** "Thus saith the Lord Almighty, 'Enquire now of the priests concerning the law, saying:
**12** If a man bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with the skirt of his garment do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any manner of food, shall it be made holy?'"
