ΠΑΡΟΙΜΙΑΙ.
ΚΕΦΑΛΑΙΟΝ. Α΄. Ι.
ΠΑΡΟΙΜΙΑΙ Σαλωμῶντος υἱοῦ Δαυΐδ, ὃς ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ἰσ- 1
ραήλ, γνῶναι σοφίαν καὶ παιδείαν, νοῆσαί τε λόγους φρονήσεως, 2
δέξασθαί τε στροφὰς λόγων, νοῆσαι τὸ δικαιοσύνην ἀληθῆ, καὶ κρί- 3
μα κατευθύνειν· ἵνα δῷ ἀκάκοις πανουργίαν, παιδὶ δὲ νέῳ αἴσθη- 4
σιν τε καὶ ἔννοιαν. Τῶν τε γὰρ ἀκούσας σοφὸς σοφώτερος ἔσται, 5
ὁ δὲ νοήμων κυβέρνησιν κτήσεται· νοήσει τε παραβολὴν καὶ σκοτει- 6
νὸν λόγον, ῥήσεις τε σοφῶν καὶ αἰνίγματα. Ἀρχὴ σοφίας φόβος 7
Κυρίου, (σύνεσις δὲ ἀγαθὴ πᾶσι τοῖς ποιοῦσιν αὐτήν· εὐσέβεια δὲ
εἰς Θεὸν ἀρχὴ αἰσθήσεως)· σοφίαν δὲ καὶ παιδείαν ἀσεβεῖς ἐξουθε-
νήσουσιν. Ἄκουε υἱὲ παιδείαν πατρός σου, καὶ μὴ ἀπώσῃ θεσμοὺς 8
μητρός σου· στέφανον γὰρ χαρίτων ἔξῃ σῇ κορυφῇ, καὶ κλοιὸν χρύ- 9
σεον περὶ σῷ τραχήλῳ. Υἱὲ μὴ σε πλανήσωσιν ἄνδρες ἀσεβεῖς, 10
μηδὲ βουληθῇς, ἐὰν παρακαλέσωσί σε, λέγοντες· ἐλθὲ μεθ᾿ ἡμῶν, 11
κοινωνήσωμεν αἵματος· κρύψωμεν δὲ εἰς γῆν ἄνδρα δίκαιον ἀδίκως,
καταπίωμεν δὲ αὐτὸν ὥσπερ ᾅδης ζῶντα, καὶ ἄρωμεν αὐτοῦ τὴν 12
μνήμην ἐκ γῆς, τὴν κτῆσιν αὐτοῦ τὴν πολυτελῆ καταλαβώμεθα, 13
πλήσωμεν δὲ οἴκους ἡμετέρους σκύλων. Τὸν δὲ σὸν κλῆρον βάλε 14
ἐν ἡμῖν· κοινὸν δὲ βαλλάντιον κτησώμεθα πάντες, καὶ μαρσίππιον
ἓν γενηθήτω ἡμῖν. Μὴ πορευθῇς ἐν ὁδῷ μετ᾿ αὐτῶν· ἐκκλινον δὲ 15
τὸν σὸν πόδα ἐκ τῶν τρίβων αὐτῶν. Οἱ γὰρ πόδες αὐτῶν εἰς κα- 16
κίαν τρέχουσι, καὶ ταχινοί εἰσι τοῦ ἐκχέαι αἷμα· οὐ γὰρ ἀδίκως 17
ἐκτείνεται δίκτυα πτερωτοῖς. Αὐτοὶ γὰρ οἱ φόνου μετέχοντες, θη- 18
σαυρίζουσιν ἑαυτοῖς κακά· (ἡ δὲ καταστροφὴ ἀνδρῶν παρανόμων
κακή). Αὗται αἱ ὁδοί εἰσι πάντων τῶν συντελούντων τὰ ἄνομα· 19
τῇ γὰρ ἀσεβείᾳ τὴν ἑαυτῶν ψυχὴν ἀφαιροῦνται. Σοφία ἐν ἐξόδοις 20
ὑμνεῖται, ἐν δὲ πλατείαις παρρησίαν ἄγει· ἐπ᾿ ἄκρων (δὲ) τει- 21
χέων κηρύσσεται, (ἐπὶ δὲ πύλαις δυναστῶν παρεδρεύει,) ἐπὶ δὲ πύ-
λαις πόλεως θαρροῦσα λέγει· ὅσον ἂν χρόνον ἄκακοι ἔχωνται τῆς 22
δικαιοσύνης, οὐκ αἰσχυνθήσονται· οἱ δὲ ἄφρονες τῆς ὕβρεως ὄντες

**PROVERBS.**
**CHAPTER I.**

1 The Proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, who reigned in Israel:
2 To know wisdom and instruction, and to perceive the words of understanding;
3 To receive the turns of words, to understand the true righteousness, and to direct judgment;
4 That it may give shrewdness to the simple, and to the young man knowledge and understanding.
5 For a wise man, having heard, shall be wiser; and he that understandeth shall obtain guidance.
6 He shall also understand a parable and a dark saying, the words of the wise and their riddles.
7 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; (and good understanding is to all them that practice it; but piety towards God is the beginning of perception); but the ungodly shall despise wisdom and instruction.
8 Hear, my son, the instruction of thy father, and cast not away the ordinances of thy mother;
9 For thou shalt have a crown of graces upon thy head, and a golden chain about thy neck.
10 My son, let not ungodly men lead thee astray, and consent thou not,
11 If they call upon thee, saying, “Come with us, let us partake in blood; let us hide a righteous man unjustly in the earth;
12 Let us swallow him up alive as Hades, and let us remove his memory from the earth.
13 Let us seize his precious possession; let us fill our houses with spoils.
14 Cast thou thy lot among us; and let us all obtain a common purse, and let there be one pouch for us.”
15 Walk thou not in the way with them; but turn thy foot from their paths.
16 For their feet run to evil, and they are swift to shed blood;
17 For not unjustly are nets spread for winged creatures.
18 For they that partake in murder, they themselves lay up evils for themselves; (and the destruction of lawless men is evil).
19 These are the ways of all them that accomplish lawless deeds; for by their ungodliness they deprive themselves of their own soul.
20 Wisdom is praised in the exits, and in the broad ways she utters boldness;
21 Upon the tops of the walls is she proclaimed, (and by the gates of rulers she attends,) and at the gates of the city, she boldly says:
22 “As long as the guileless cling to righteousness, they shall not be ashamed; but the senseless, being insolent…”
