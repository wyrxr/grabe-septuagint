φωνῆς σου, καὶ ἐν τοῖς προστάγμασί σου οὐκ ἐπορεύθησαν·
ἅπαντα ἃ ἐνετείλω αὐτοῖς οὐκ ἐποίησαν, καὶ ἐποίησαν συμβῆναι
24 αὐτοῖς ἅπαντα τὰ κακὰ ταῦτα. Καὶ ἰδοὺ ὄχλος ἥκει εἰς τὴν
πόλιν ταύτην συλλαβεῖν αὐτήν, καὶ ἡ πόλις ἐδόθη εἰς χεῖ-
ρας Χαλδαίων τῶν πολεμούντων αὐτὴν ἀπὸ προσώπου
μαχαίρας, καὶ τοῦ λιμοῦ, καὶ τοῦ θανάτου, καὶ ὡς ἐλά-
25 λησας, οὕτως ἐγένετο· καὶ σὺ ὁρᾷς. Καὶ σὺ λέγεις πρός με,
δέσποτα Κύριε, κτῆσαι σεαυτῷ τὸν ἀγρὸν ἀργυρίου· καὶ ἔγραψα
εἰς βιβλίον, καὶ ἐσφραγισάμην, καὶ ἐπεμαρτυράμην μάρτυρας,
καὶ ἡ πόλις ἐδόθη εἰς χεῖρας Χαλδαίων. Καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος
27 Κυρίου πρός με, λέγων. Ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς πάσης σαρκός,
28 μὴ ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ κρυβήσεται πᾶς ὁ λόγος ; Διὰ τοῦτο οὕτως εἶπε
Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ· δοθεῖσα παραδοθήσεται ἡ πόλις αὕτη εἰς
χεῖρας Χαλδαίων, καὶ εἰς χεῖρας Ναβουχοδονόσορ βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος,
29 καὶ λήψεται αὐτήν, καὶ ἥξουσιν οἱ Χαλδαῖοι πολεμοῦντες ἐπὶ τὴν πόλιν ταύτην, καὶ καύσουσι τὴν πόλιν ταύτην ἐν
πυρί, καὶ καύσουσι τὰς οἰκίας, ἐν αἷς ἐθυμίασαν ἐν αὐταῖς ἐπὶ
τῶν δωμάτων αὐτῶν τῇ Βάαλ, καὶ ἔσπεδον σπονδὰς θεοῖς
30 ἑτέροις, πρὸς τὸ παραπικράναι με. Ὅτι ἦσαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ
καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰούδα μόνοι ποιοῦντες τὸ πονηρὸν ἐκ νεότητος αὐτῶν
κατ᾿ ὀφθαλμούς μου· πλὴν ὅτι οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ παρώργισάν
31 με ἐν τοῖς ἔργοις τῶν χειρῶν αὐτῶν, φησὶ Κύριος. Ὅτι ἐπὶ
τὴν ὀργήν μου, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν θυμόν μου ἦν ἡ πόλις αὕτη, ἀφ᾿ ἧς
ἡμέρας ᾠκοδόμησαν αὐτήν, καὶ ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης, ἀπαλλάξαι
32 αὐτὴν ἀπὸ προσώπου μου, διὰ πάσας τὰς πονηρίας υἱῶν
Ἰσραὴλ καὶ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰούδα, ὧν ἐποίησαν παραπικράναι με,
αὐτοὶ καὶ οἱ πατέρες αὐτῶν, καὶ οἱ βασιλεῖς αὐτῶν, καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες
αὐτῶν, καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς αὐτῶν, καὶ οἱ προφῆται αὐτῶν, ἄνδρες
33 Ἰούδα, καὶ οἱ κατοικοῦντες ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἀπέστρεψαν
πρός με νῶτον, καὶ οὐ πρόσωπον· καὶ ἐδίδαξα αὐτοὺς
ὀρθρίζων καὶ διδάσκων, καὶ οὐκ ἤκουσαν ἔτι λαβεῖν
34 παιδείαν. Καὶ ἔθηκαν τὰ μιάσματα αὐτῶν ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ, ᾧ ἐπεκλήθη
τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ, ἐν ἀκαθαρσίαις αὐτῶν. Καὶ
35 ᾠκοδόμησαν τοὺς βωμοὺς αὐτῶν τῇ Βάαλ τοὺς ἐν φάραγγι
υἱοῦ Ἐννόμ, τοῦ ἀναφέρειν τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτῶν καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας
αὐτῶν τῷ Μολόχ βασιλεῖ, ἃ οὐ συνέταξα αὐτοῖς, καὶ οὐκ ἀνέβη

**JEREMIAH 32**

**23** ...thy voice, nor walked they in Thy commandments; all that which I commanded them they did not, but rather brought all these evils to pass upon themselves.
**24** And behold, an host draweth nigh against this city to take it; and the city hath been delivered into the hands of the Chaldeans, who wage war against it, by the sword, and by famine, and by pestilence;
**25** and as Thou didst speak, so it hath come to pass, and Thou Thyself dost behold it. And Thou sayest unto me, O Master, Lord, "Purchase for thyself the field with silver!" yet I have written [it] in a scroll, and sealed [it], and called forth witnesses, even whilst the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans.

**27** Then came the word of the Lord unto me, saying,
**28** "I am the Lord, the God of all flesh; shall any word be hidden from Me? Therefore thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel: This city, having been [already] given, shall surely be delivered into the hands of the Chaldeans, and into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon;
**29** and he shall take it. And the Chaldeans, who fight against this city, shall come and burn this city with fire; and they shall burn the houses in which they offered incense upon their rooftops unto Baal, and poured out libations unto other gods, to provoke Me to [My] great wrath.
**30** For the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah did naught but evil in My sight from their youth; for the sons of Israel provoked Me to grievous wrath by the works of their own hands, saith the Lord.
**31** For this city hath been [as] a cause for My wrath and for My fierce indignation, from the day that they built it even until this day, [so that I might] cast it forth from My presence;
**32** because of all the wickedness of the sons of Israel and of the sons of Judah, which they wrought to provoke Me to anger; they themselves, and their fathers, and their kings, and their princes, and their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
**33** And they turned unto Me their back, and not their face; and though I taught them, rising up early and teaching [them diligently], yet they hearkened not to receive instruction.
**34** And they set their abominations in the House whereupon My Name was called, [and filled it] with their uncleannesses.
**35** And they built their altars unto Baal, [even those] in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to offer up their sons and their daughters unto Moloch the king; which I commanded them not, neither did it ever come into My heart,
