10 δικαιοσύνην μάθετε, ὅτε οἱ ἐνοικοῦντες ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς. Πέπαυται γὰρ ὁ ἀσεβής· οὐκ μὴ
μάθῃ δικαιοσύνην ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς· ἀλήθειαν οὐ μὴ ποιήσῃ· ἀρθήτω
11 ὁ ἀσεβής, ἵνα μὴ ἴδῃ τὴν δόξαν Κυρίου. Κύριε, ὑψηλός σου ὁ βρα-
χίων, καὶ οὐκ ᾔδεισαν. γνόντες δὲ αἰσχυνθήσονται· ζῆλος λή-
ψεται λαὸν ἀπαίδευτον, καὶ νῦν πῦρ τοὺς ὑπεναντίους ἔδεται.
12 Κύριε ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν, εἰρήνην δὸς ἡμῖν, πάντα γὰρ τὰ ἔργα ἡμῶν
13 ἀπέδωκας ἡμῖν. Κύριε ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν, κτῆσαι ἡμᾶς· Κύριε ἐκτὸς σοῦ
14 ἄλλον οὐκ οἴδαμεν· τὸ ὄνομά σου ὀνομάζομεν. οἱ δὲ νεκροὶ ζωὴν οὐ μὴ
ἴδωσιν, οὐδὲ ἰατροὶ οὐ μὴ ἀναστήσουσιν· διὰ τοῦτο ἐπήγαγες, καὶ ἀπώ-
15 λεσας, καὶ ἦρας πᾶν ἄρσεν αὐτῶν. Πρόσθες αὐτοῖς κακά, Κύ-
ριε, πρόσθες κακὰ πᾶσι τοῖς ἐνδόξοις· ἐμάκρυνας πάντα τὰ πέρατα
16 τῆς γῆς. Κύριε, ἐν θλίψει ἐμνήσθην σου, ἐν θλίψει μικρᾷ ἡ παι-
17 δεία σου ἡμῖν. Καὶ ὡς ἡ ὠδίνουσα ἐγγίζει τοῦ τεκεῖν, καὶ
ἐπὶ τῇ ὠδῖνι αὐτῆς ἐκέκραγεν, οὕτως ἐγενήθημεν τῷ ἀγαπητῷ σου.
18 Διὰ τὸν φόβον σου, Κύριε, ἐν γαστρὶ ἐλάβομεν, καὶ ὠδινήσαμεν,
καὶ ἐτέκομεν· πνεῦμα σωτηρίας σου οὐκ ἐποιήσαμεν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς·
19 ἀλλὰ πεσοῦνται οἱ ἐνοικοῦντες ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς. Ἀναστήσονται γὰρ
οἱ νεκροί σου, καὶ ἐγερθήσονται· οἱ ἐν τοῖς μνημείοις, καὶ εὐφραν-
θήσονται οἱ ἐν τῇ γῇ· ἡ γὰρ δρόσος ἡ παρὰ σοῦ ἴαμα αὐτοῖς
20 ἐστιν, ἡ δὲ γῆ τῶν ἀσεβῶν πεσεῖται. Βάδιζε ὁ λαός μου, εἴ-
σελθε εἰς τὰ ταμιεῖά σου, ἀπόκλεισον τὴν θύραν σου, ἀποκρύβηθι
21 μικρὸν ὅσον ὅσον, ἕως ἂν παρέλθῃ ἡ ὀργὴ Κυρίου. Ἰδοὺ
γὰρ Κύριος ἀπὸ τοῦ ἁγίου ἐπάγει τὴν ὀργὴν ἐπὶ τοὺς ἐνοικοῦντας
ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς κατ᾿ αὐτῶν· καὶ ἀνακαλύψει ἡ γῆ τὸ αἷμα αὐτῆς,
καὶ οὐ κατακαλύψει ἔτι τοὺς ἀνηρημένους ἔτι.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΖ΄. XXVII.

1 ἘΝ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἐπάξει ὁ Θεὸς τὴν μάχαιραν αὐτοῦ
τὴν ἁγίαν, καὶ τὴν μεγάλην, καὶ τὴν ἰσχυρὰν ἐπὶ τὸν δράκοντα ὄφιν
φεύγοντα, ἐπὶ τὸν δράκοντα ὄφιν σκολιόν· καὶ ἀνελεῖ τὸν δράκοντα
2 τὸν ἐν τῇ θαλάσσῃ. Τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, ἀμπελὼν καλὸς ἐπιθύμημα
3 ἐξάρχειν κατ᾿ αὐτῆς. Ἐγὼ πόλις ὀχυρά, πόλις πολιορκουμένη·
μάτην ποτιῶ αὐτήν· ἀλώσεται γὰρ νυκτός, ἡμέρας δὲ πεσεῖται
4 τὸ τεῖχος. Καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν, ὃς οὐκ ἐπελάθετο αὐτῆς· τίς με θήσει
φυλάσσειν καλάμην ἐν ἀγρῷ; διὰ τὴν πολεμίαν ταύτην

**Chapter 26**

**10** Learn righteousness, [O ye] when the inhabitants upon the earth [are taught]. For the wicked man hath ceased; he shall not learn righteousness upon the earth, neither shall he do truth.
**11** Let the wicked man be taken away, that he may not behold the glory of the Lord. O Lord, high is Thine arm, and they knew it not. But when they know, they shall be ashamed; zeal shall seize an untaught people, and now fire shall devour Thine adversaries.
**12** O Lord our God, give us peace, for all our works hast Thou wrought for us.
**13** O Lord our God, do Thou possess us; O Lord, besides Thee we know no other; we call upon Thy Name.
**14** But the dead shall not see life, neither shall physicians raise them up. Therefore hast Thou brought [destruction upon them], and destroyed [them], and taken away every male of them.
**15** Add evils unto them, O Lord, add evils unto all the glorious ones; Thou hast extended [Thy judgment unto] all the ends of the earth.
**16** O Lord, in tribulation I remembered Thee; in slight tribulation was Thy chastisement upon us.
**17** And as a woman in travail draweth near to give birth, and crieth out in her pangs, so became we unto Thy beloved [one].
**18** Because of Thy fear, O Lord, we have conceived in the womb, and we have been in travail, and we have given birth; [but] we brought forth no spirit of Thy salvation upon the earth.
**19** But those who dwell upon the earth shall fall. For Thy dead shall rise, and they shall be raised up; they that are in the graves, and they that are in the earth shall rejoice. For the dew that is from Thee is healing unto them, but the land of the wicked shall fall.
**20** Go, My people, enter into thy chambers, close thy door, hide thyself for a very little while, until the indignation of the Lord shall be overpast.
**21** For behold, the Lord bringeth forth wrath from His holy place upon those who dwell upon the earth against them; and the earth shall uncover her blood, and shall no longer cover her slain [ones] *at all*.

**Chapter 27**

**1** In that day shall God bring His holy, and great, and mighty sword upon the dragon, the fleeing serpent; upon the dragon, the crooked serpent; and He shall slay the dragon that is in the sea.
**2** In that day, a beautiful vineyard [shall be] a desirable thing to sing concerning it.
**3** "I am a strong city, a city besieged; in vain shall I water it; for by night it shall be taken, and by day the wall thereof shall fall.
**4** And there is none who hath not forgotten her; who shall set me to keep stubble in the field? because of this enmity."
