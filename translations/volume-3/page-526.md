**ΩΣΗΕ ΚΕΦ. Ι. ΙΑ΄.**
**6** τοῦ, ὅτι μετῳκίσθη ἐπ᾽ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ αὐτὸν εἰς ᾿Ασσυρίους δῆ-
σαντες, ἀπήνεγκαν ξένια τῷ βασιλεῖ ᾿Ιαρείμ· ἐν δόματι ᾿Εφραὶμ
**7** δέξεται, καὶ αἰσχυνθήσεται ᾿Ισραὴλ ἐν τῇ βουλῇ αὐτοῦ. ᾿Απέ-
ῤῥιψε Σαμάρεια τὸν βασιλέα αὐτῆς ὡς φρύγανον ἐπὶ πρόσωπον
**8** ὕδατος· καὶ ἐξαρθήσονται βωμοὶ ὦν ἁμαρτήματα τοῦ ᾿Ισραήλ,
ἄκανθαι καὶ τρίβολοι ἀναβήσονται ἐπὶ τὰ θυσιαστήρια αὐτῶν.
Καὶ ἐροῦσι τοῖς ὄρεσι, καλύψατε ἡμᾶς, καὶ τοῖς βουνοῖς, πέσατε
**9** ἐφ᾽ ἡμᾶς. ᾿Αφ᾽ οὗ οἱ βουνοὶ, ἥμαρτεν ᾿Ισραήλ· ἐκεῖ ἔστησαν, οὐ μὴ
**10** καταλάβῃ αὐτοὺς ἐν τῷ βουνῷ πόλεμος. ᾿Επὶ τέκνα ἀδικίας. ῏Ηλθε
παιδεῦσαι αὐτούς· καὶ συναχθήσονται ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς λαοὶ, ἐν τῷ παι-
**11** δεῦσθαι αὐτοὺς ἐν ταῖς δυσὶν ἀδικίαις αὐτῶν. ᾿Εφραὶμ δάμαλις
δεδιδαγμένη ἀγαπᾶν νεῖκος· ἐγὼ δὲ ἐπελεύσομαι ἐπὶ τὸ κάλλι-
στον τοῦ τραχήλου αὐτῆς, ἐπιβιβῶ ᾿Εφραὶμ, καὶ παρασιωπήσομαι
**12** ᾿Ιούδαν, ἐνισχύσει αὐτῷ ᾿Ιακώβ. Σπείρατε ἑαυτοῖς εἰς δικαιοσύ-
νην, τρυγήσατε ἑαυτοῖς εἰς καρπὸν ζωῆς· φωτίσατε ἑαυτοῖς φῶς
γνώσεως, ἐκζητήσατε τὸν Κύριον, ἕως τοῦ ἐλθεῖν γεννήματα δι-
**13** καιοσύνης ὑμῖν. ῞Ινατί παρεσιωπήσατε ἀσέβειαν, καὶ τὰς ἀδικίας
αὐτῆς ἐτρυγήσατε, ἐφάγετε καρπὸν ψευδῆ; ῞Οτι ἤλπισας ἐν ἅρ-
**14** μασί σου, ἐν πλήθει δυνάμεώς σου, καὶ ἐξαναστήσεται ἀπώλεια
ἐν τῷ λαῷ σου, καὶ πάντα τὰ περιτετειχισμένα σου οἰχήσεται.
Ὡς ἄρχων Σαλαμὰν ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου ᾿Ιεροβαὰλ ἐν ἡμέραις πολέμου
**15** μητέρα ἐπὶ τέκνοις ἠδάφισαν, οὕτως ποιήσω ὑμῖν, οἶκος τοῦ ᾿Ισ-
ραὴλ, ἀπὸ προσώπου ἀδικίας κακῶν ὑμῶν.

**1** ΟΡΘΡΟΥ ἀπερρίφησαν. ἀπερρίφη βασιλεὺς τοῦ ᾿Ισραὴλ, διότι
νήπιος ᾿Ισραὴλ, καὶ ἐγὼ ἠγάπηκα αὐτὸν, καὶ ἐξ Αἰγύπτου μετε-

ἀπώχοντο ἐκ προσώπου μου· αὐτοὶ τοῖς Βααλεὶμ ἔθυον, καὶ τοῖς

αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὸν βραχίονά μου, καὶ οὐκ ἔγνωσαν, ὅτι ἴαμαι αὐτούς.
**4** ᾿Εν διαφθορᾷ ἀνθρώπων ἐξέτεινα αὐτοὺς ἐν δεσμοῖς ἀγαπήσεώς
μου, καὶ ἐγὼ ἔσομαι αὐτοῖς ὡς ῥαπίζων ἄνθρωπος ἐπὶ τὰς σια-

**CHAPTER 10**

**6** of it, for it was carried away upon it. And even it, having bound [it], they carried away as a gift unto the Assyrians, [even] unto King Jareb. Ephraim shall receive [it] as a gift, and Israel shall be put to shame in his own counsel.
**7** Samaria hath cast off her king as a splinter upon the face of the water.
**8** And the altars of On, [which are] the sins of Israel, shall be taken away; thorns and thistles shall come up upon their altars. And they shall say to the mountains, 'Cover us,' and to the hills, 'Fall upon us.'
**9** Since the [days of] Gibeah hath Israel sinned; there they stood. War shall not overtake them in Gibeah.
**10** Upon the children of iniquity. He hath come to chasten them; and peoples shall be gathered against them, when they are chastened for their two iniquities.
**11** Ephraim is a trained heifer that loveth to contend; but I will come upon the fairest [part] of her neck. I will cause Ephraim to be yoked, and I will let Judah pass by in silence; Jacob shall strengthen him.
**12** Sow for yourselves unto righteousness, reap for yourselves unto the fruit of life; enlighten for yourselves the light of knowledge. Seek ye the Lord, until the offspring of righteousness doth come unto you.
**13** Why have ye tolerated ungodliness, and reaped its iniquities, and eaten the fruit of deceit? For thou hast hoped in thy chariots, in the multitude of thy might,
**14** and destruction shall rise up among thy people, and all thy fortified places shall be overthrown. As prince Salmana from the house of Jerubbaal did in the days of war, when they dashed a mother upon her children,
**15** so will I do unto you, O house of Israel, because of the iniquity of your evils.

**CHAPTER 11**

**1** At early morn they were cast off. The king of Israel was cast off, because Israel was a child, and I loved him, and from Egypt I called his children.
**2** As I called them, so they turned away from My presence. They themselves sacrificed unto the Baalim, and burned incense unto graven images.
**3** And I taught Ephraim to walk, I took him up upon Mine arm, yet they knew not that I healed them.
**4** In the corruption of men I did draw them forth with the bonds of My love, and I shall be unto them as a man that smiteth upon his cheeks; and I shall look upon him, and shall prevail over him.
**5** Ephraim shall dwell in Egypt, and Asshur himself shall be his king;
