ΚΕΦ. Γ´. ΙΙΙ.

**3** χήρυξον ἐν αὐτῇ κατὰ τὸ κήρυγμα τὸ ἔμπροσθεν, ὃ ἐγὼ ἐλάλησα πρὸς σέ. Καὶ ἀνέστη Ἰωνᾶς, καὶ ἐπορεύθη εἰς Νινευὴ, καθὼς ἐλάλησε Κύριος· ἡ δὲ Νινευὴ ἦν πόλις μεγάλη τῷ Θεῷ, ὡσεὶ
**4** πορείας ὁδοῦ ἡμερῶν τριῶν. Καὶ ἤρξατο Ἰωνᾶς τοῦ εἰσπορεύεσθαι εἰς τὴν πόλιν, ὡσεὶ πορείαν ὁδοῦ ἡμέρας μιᾶς, καὶ ἐκήρυξεν, καὶ εἶπεν· ἔτι τρεῖς ἡμέραι, καὶ Νινευὴ καταστραφήσεται. Καὶ
**5** ἐπίστευσαν οἱ ἄνδρες Νινευὴ τῷ Θεῷ, καὶ ἐκήρυξαν νηστείαν, καὶ ἐνεδύσαντο σάκκους ἀπὸ μεγάλου αὐτῶν ἕως μικροῦ αὐτῶν.
**6** Καὶ ἤγγισεν ὁ λόγος πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα τῆς Νινευὴ· καὶ ἐξανέστη ἀπὸ τοῦ θρόνου αὐτοῦ, καὶ περιείλατο τὴν στολὴν αὐτοῦ ἀφ᾿ ἑαυτοῦ, καὶ περιεβάλετο σάκκον, καὶ ἐκάθισεν ἐπὶ σποδοῦ. Καὶ ἐ-
**7** κηρύχθη, καὶ ἐξέδθη ἐν τῇ Νινευὴ παρὰ τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ παρὰ τῶν μεγιστάνων αὐτοῦ, λέγων· οἱ ἄνθρωποι καὶ τὰ κτήνη, καὶ οἱ βόες, καὶ τὰ πρόβατα μὴ γευέσθωσαν μηδὲν, μηδὲ νεμέσθωσαν, μηδὲ ὕδωρ πιέτωσαν.
**8** Καὶ περιεβάλοντο σάκκους οἱ ἄνθρωποι καὶ τὰ κτήνη, καὶ ἀνεβόησαν πρὸς τὸν Θεὸν ἐκτενῶς. Καὶ ἀπέστρεψαν ἕκαστος ἀπὸ τῆς ὁδοῦ αὐτοῦ τῆς πονηρᾶς, καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς
**9** ἀδικίας τῆς ἐν χερσὶν αὐτῶν, λέγοντες· τίς οἶδεν εἰ μετανοήσει ὁ Θεὸς, καὶ ἀποστρέψει ἐξ ὀργῆς θυμοῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἀπολώμεθα;
**10** Καὶ εἶδεν ὁ Θεὸς τὰ ἔργα αὐτῶν, ὅτι ἀπέστρεψαν ἀπὸ τῶν ὁδῶν αὐτῶν τῶν πονηρῶν· καὶ μετενόησεν ὁ Θεὸς ἐπὶ τῇ κακίᾳ, ᾗ ἐλάλησε τοῦ ποιῆσαι αὐτοῖς, καὶ οὐκ ἐποίησε.

ΚΕΦ. Δ´. IV.

**1.2** ΚΑΙ ἐλυπήθη Ἰωνᾶς λύπην μεγάλην, καὶ συνεχύθη· καὶ προσηύξατο πρὸς Κύριον, καὶ εἶπεν· ὦ δὴ· Κύριε, οὐχ οὗτοι οἱ λόγοι μου, οὓς ἐλάλησα ἔτι ὄντος μου ἐν τῇ γῇ μου; διὰ τοῦτο προέφθασα τοῦ φυγεῖν εἰς Θαρσεῖς, διότι ἔγνων, ὅτι σὺ ἐλεήμων καὶ οἰκτίρμων, μακρόθυμος καὶ πολυέλεος, καὶ μετανοῶν ἐπὶ ταῖς
**3** κακίαις. Καὶ νῦν, δέσποτα Κύριε, λάβε τὴν ψυχήν μου ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ,
**4** ὅτι καλὸν τὸ ἀποθανεῖν με ἢ ζῆν με. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Ἰωνᾶν· εἰ σφόδρα λελύπησαι σύ;
**5** Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Ἰωνᾶς ἐκ τῆς πόλεως, καὶ ἐκάθισεν ἀπέναντι τῆς πόλεως· καὶ ἐποίησεν ἐκεῖ σκηνὴν ἑαυτῷ, καὶ ἐκάθητο ὑποκάτω αὐτῆς ἐν σκιᾷ, ἕως οὗ ἀφίδῃ

JONAH
CHAPTER III

**3** proclaim therein according to the former proclamation which I spake unto thee." And Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, as the LORD had spoken. Now Nineveh was a city great unto God, as a journey of three days.
**4** And Jonah began to enter into the city, as a journey of one day, and he proclaimed, and said, "Yet three days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown."
**5** And the men of Nineveh believed God, and they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.
**6** And the word came nigh unto the king of Nineveh; and he arose from his throne, and took off his royal robe from himself, and put on sackcloth, and sat upon ashes.
**7** And it was proclaimed, and it was decreed in Nineveh by the king and by his great ones, saying, "Let neither man nor beast, neither oxen nor sheep, taste anything, nor let them feed, nor drink water.
**8** But let men and beasts be clothed with sackcloth, and let them cry earnestly unto God; and let each turn from his evil way, and from the iniquity that is in their hands,
**9** saying, 'Who knoweth if God will relent and turn from His fierce anger, and we perish not?'"
**10** And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil ways; and God relented concerning the evil, which He had spoken to do unto them; and He did it not.

CHAPTER IV

**1.2** But Jonah was grieved with a great grief, and was vexed. And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, "Ah, LORD, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I made haste to flee unto Tarshish, for I knew that Thou art a merciful God, and compassionate, long-suffering, and plenteous in mercy, and Who relents concerning evils.
**3** And now, O Sovereign LORD, take, I pray Thee, my life from me,
**4** for it is better for me to die than to live." And the LORD said unto Jonah, "Is it well that thou art so greatly grieved?"
**5** And Jonah went out of the city, and sat over against the city; and he made there a booth for himself, and sat under it in the shade, until he might see what would become of the city.
**6** And the LORD God commanded a gourd, and it grew...
