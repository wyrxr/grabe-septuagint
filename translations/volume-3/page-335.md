τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἀμμὼν, καὶ πάντας βασιλεῖς Τύρου, καὶ πάντας βασι- 22
λεῖς Σιδῶνος, καὶ βασιλεῖς τῆς νήσου τῆς ἐν τῷ πέραν τῆς θαλάσ-
σης, καὶ τὴν Δαιδὰν, καὶ τὴν Θαιμὰν, καὶ τὴν Ῥὼς, καὶ πᾶν 23
περικεκαρμένον κατὰ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντας τοὺς βασι- 24
λεῖς τῆς Ἀραβίας, καὶ πάντας τοὺς βασιλεῖς τοὺς συμμί-
κτους (αὐτοῦ) τοὺς καταλύοντας ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, καὶ πάντας τοὺς 25
βασιλεῖς Ζαμβρί, καὶ πάντας βασιλεῖς Αἰλὰμ, καὶ πάντας βα-
σιλεῖς Περσῶν, καὶ πάντας βασιλεῖς τοῦ ἀπηλιώτου τοὺς πόρ- 26
ῥω καὶ τοὺς ἐγγὺς, ἕκαστον πρὸς τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάσας
τὰς βασιλείας τὰς ἐπὶ προσώπου τῆς γῆς, καὶ βασιλεὺς Σησὰχ
πίεται ἔσχατος αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐρεῖς αὐτοῖς, οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος 27
παντοκράτωρ ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ Ἰσραήλ· πίετε καὶ μεθύσθητε, καὶ ἐ-
ξεμέσατε, καὶ πεσεῖσθε, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἀναστῆτε ἀπὸ προσώπου τῆς
μαχαίρας, ἧς ἐγὼ ἀποστέλλω ἀνάμεσον ὑμῶν. Καὶ ἔσται ὅταν 28
μὴ βούλωνται δέξασθαι τὸ ποτήριον ἐκ τῆς χειρός σου, ὥστε
πιεῖν, καὶ ἐρεῖς αὐτοῖς· οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος τῶν δυνάμεων· πί-
οντες πίεσθε, ὅτι ἐν πόλει ἐφ᾿ ἣν ὠνομάσθη τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐπ᾿ 29
αὐτὴν, ἐγὼ ἄρχομαι κακῶσαι, καὶ ὑμεῖς καθάρσει καθαρισθή-
σεσθε; οὐ μὴ καθαρισθῆτε, ὅτι μάχαιραν ἐγὼ καλῶ ἐπὶ πάν-
τας τοὺς καθημένους ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, φησὶ Κύριος τῶν δυνάμεων.
Καὶ σὺ προφητεύσεις πάντας τοὺς λόγους τούτους ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς, 30
καὶ ἐρεῖς αὐτοῖς· Κύριος ἀφ᾿ ὑψηλοῦ χρηματιεῖ, ἀπὸ τοῦ ἁγίου
αὐτοῦ δώσει φωνὴν αὐτοῦ, λόγον χρηματιεῖ ἐπὶ τοῦ τόπου αὐτοῦ,
καὶ οἶδε ὥσπερ τρυγῶντες ἀποκριθήσονται· καὶ ἐπὶ πάντας τοὺς
καθημένους ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ἥκει ὄλεθρος, ἐπὶ μέρος τῆς γῆς, ὅτι κρί- 31
σις τῷ Κυρίῳ ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι· κρίνεται αὐτὸς πρὸς πᾶσαν σάρκα,
οἱ δὲ ἀσεβεῖς ἐδόθησαν εἰς μάχαιραν, λέγει Κύριος. Οὕτως εἶπε 32
Κύριος τῶν δυνάμεων· ἰδοὺ κακὰ ἔρχεται ἀπὸ ἔθνους εἰς ἔθνος·
καὶ λαῖλαψ μεγάλη ἐκπορεύεται ἀπ᾿ ἐσχάτου τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἔσον- 33
ται τραυματίαι ὑπὸ Κυρίου ἐν ἡμέρᾳ Κυρίου, ἐκ μέρους τῆς γῆς,
καὶ ἕως εἰς μέρος τῆς γῆς· οὐ μὴ κοπῶσιν, οὐδὲ μὴ συναχθῶ-
σι, καὶ οὐ μὴ κατορυγῶσιν εἰς κόπρια, ἐπὶ προσώπου τῆς γῆς
ἔσονται. Ἀλαλάξατε ποιμένες, καὶ κεκεράξατε, καὶ κόπτεσθε οἱ 34
χριοὶ τῶν προβάτων, ὅτι ἐπληρώθησαν αἱ ἡμέραι ὑμῶν εἰς σφα-
γὴν, καὶ οἱ σκορπισμοὶ ὑμῶν, καὶ πεσεῖσθε ὥσπερ οἱ χριοὶ οἱ
ἐκλεκτοὶ, καὶ ἀπολεῖται φυγὴ ἀπὸ τῶν ποιμένων, καὶ σωτηρία 35

**Jeremiah, Chapter 32**

**22** the sons of Ammon; and all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Sidon; and the kings of the isle that is beyond the sea;
**23** and Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all those whose hair is shorn round about [their temples];
**24** and all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mixed multitude (of them) that dwell in the wilderness;
**25** and all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Persians;
**26** and all the kings of the east, both those that are far and those that are near, each to his brother; and all the kingdoms that are upon the face of the earth: and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.
**27** Then shalt thou say unto them, "Thus saith the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel: Drink ye, and be drunken, and vomit, and fall down, and ye shall not rise from before the face of the sword, which I send among you."
**28** And it shall come to pass, when they refuse to take the cup from thine hand to drink, then shalt thou say unto them, "Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Ye shall surely drink.
**29** For behold, in the city upon which My name is called, I begin to bring forth evil, and shall ye be made clean by cleansing? Ye shall not be made clean, for I call for a sword upon all them that dwell upon the earth," saith the Lord of hosts.
**30** Thou shalt prophesy against them all these words, and say unto them: "The Lord shall utter an oracle from on high, and from His holy habitation shall He give forth His voice; He shall utter a word from His place; and these, even as vintagers, shall answer [with a shout]. And destruction cometh upon all them that dwell upon the earth, upon a part of the earth.
**31** For the Lord hath a controversy with the nations; He judgeth all flesh; as for the ungodly, they are delivered to the sword," saith the Lord.
**32** Thus saith the Lord of hosts: "Behold, evil goeth forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind issueth from the uttermost parts of the earth.
**33** And the slain of the Lord shall be in that day, from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth; they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be as dung upon the face of the earth.
**34** Howl, ye shepherds, and cry aloud; and wail, ye rams of the flock; for your days are fulfilled for slaughter, and your scatterings; and ye shall fall like the choice rams,
**35** and flight shall perish from the shepherds, and deliverance [from the rams of the flock]."
