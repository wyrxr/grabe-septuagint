ΚΕΦ. Κʹ. ΙΕΖΕΚΙΗΛ. 1361
θεοῖς αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔταξαν ἐκεῖ θυμὸν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔθεντο
ὀσμὴν εὐωδίας αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔσπεισαν ἐκεῖ τὰς σπονδὰς αὐτῶν, καὶ 29
εἶπα πρὸς αὐτούς· τί ἐστιν Ἀββαμὰ ὅτι ὑμεῖς εἰσπορεύεσθε ἐκεῖ,
καὶ ἐπεκάλεσαν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ἀββαμὰ ἕως τῆς σήμερον ἡμέρας.
Διὰ τοῦτο εἰπὸν πρὸς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Ἰσραήλ· τάδε λέγει Κύριος 30
Κύριος ὁ Θεός· εἰ ἐν ταῖς ἀνομίαις τῶν πατέρων ὑμῶν ὑμεῖς μιαίνε-
σθε, καὶ ὀπίσω τῶν βδελυγμάτων αὐτῶν ὑμεῖς ἐκπορνεύετε· καὶ ἐν 31
ταῖς ἀπαρχαῖς τῶν δομάτων ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἀφορισμοῖς υἱῶν
ὑμῶν ἐν πυρὶ ὑμεῖς μιαίνεσθε ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς ἐνθυμήμασιν ὑμῶν ἕως
τῆς σήμερον ἡμέρας· καὶ ἐγὼ ἀποκριθῶ ὑμῖν οἶκος τοῦ Ἰσραήλ;
ζῶ ἐγώ, λέγει Ἄδωναι Κύριος, εἰ ἀποκριθήσομαι ὑμῖν, καὶ εἰ
ἀναβήσεται ἐπὶ τὸ πνεῦμα ὑμῶν τοῦτο, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ὃν τρόπον 32
ὑμεῖς λέγετε· ἐσόμεθα ὡς τὰ ἔθνη, καὶ ὡς αἱ φυλαὶ τῆς γῆς,
τοῦ λατρεύειν ξύλοις καὶ λίθοις. Διὰ τοῦτο ζῶ ἐγώ, λέγει Ἄδω- 33
ναι Κύριος· ἐὰν μὴ ἐν χειρὶ κραταιᾷ, καὶ ἐν βραχίονι ὑψηλῷ,
καὶ ἐν θυμῷ κεχυμένῳ βασιλεύσω ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς, καὶ ἐξάξω ὑμᾶς ἐκ 34
τῶν λαῶν, καὶ εἰσδέξομαι ὑμᾶς ἐκ τῶν χωρῶν, οὗ διεσκορπίσθη-
τε ἐν αὐταῖς ἐν χειρὶ κραταιᾷ καὶ ἐν βραχίονι ὑψηλῷ, καὶ ἐν
θυμῷ κεχυμένῳ. Καὶ ἄξω ὑμᾶς εἰς τὴν ἔρημον τῶν λαῶν, καὶ 35
διακριθήσομαι πρὸς ὑμᾶς ἐκεῖ πρόσωπον κατὰ πρόσωπον. Ὃν 36
τρόπον διεκρίθην πρὸς τοὺς πατέρας ὑμῶν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, ὅτε ἐξή-
γαγον αὐτοὺς ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, οὕτως κἀγὼ κρινῶ ὑμᾶς, λέγει
Κύριος ὁ Θεός· καὶ διάξω ὑμᾶς ὑπὸ τὴν ῥάβδον μου, καὶ εἰσάξω 37
ὑμᾶς ἐν ἀριθμῷ, καὶ ἐκλέξω ἐξ ὑμῶν τοὺς ἀσεβεῖς καὶ τοὺς ἀ- 38
φεστηκότας, διότι ἐκ τῆς παροικεσίας αὐτῶν ἐξάξω αὐτούς, καὶ
εἰς τὴν γῆν τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ οὐκ εἰσελεύσονται, καὶ ἐπιγνώσεσθε, διότι
ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ Θεός. Καὶ ὑμεῖς οἶκος Ἰσραήλ· Τάδε λέγει Κύ- 39
ριος Κύριος· ἕκαστος τὰ ἐπιτηδεύματα αὐτοῦ ἐξάρατε, καὶ μετὰ
ταῦτα εἰ μὴ ὑμεῖς εἰσακούσετέ μου, καὶ τὸ ὄνομά μου τὸ ἅγιον οὐ
βεβηλώσετε οὐκέτι ἐν τοῖς δώροις ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἐπιτηδεύμα-
σιν ὑμῶν, διότι ἐπὶ τοῦ ὄρους τοῦ ἁγίου μου, ἐπ’ ὄρους ὑψηλοῦ, ἐ- 40
κεῖ δουλεύσουσί μοι πᾶς οἶκος Ἰσραήλ, λέγει Κύριος Κύριος, εἰς τέ-
λος· καὶ ἐκεῖ προσδέξομαι, καὶ ἐκεῖ ἐπισκέψομαι τὰς ἀπαρχὰς ὑμῶν,
καὶ τὰς ἀπαρχὰς τῶν ἀφορισμῶν ὑμῶν, ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς ἁγιάσμασιν
ὑμῶν. Ἐν ὀσμῇ εὐωδίας προσδέξομαι ὑμᾶς, ἐν τῷ ἐξάγειν με ὑμᾶς ἐκ 41
τῶν λαῶν, καὶ εἰσδέξομαι ὑμᾶς ἐκ τῶν χωρῶν, οὗ διεσκορπίσθητε ἐν

**40** For upon My holy mountain, upon a high mountain, there shall all the house of Israel serve Me, saith the Lord, the Lord, unto the end. And there will I accept [you], and there will I look favorably upon your firstfruits, and the firstfruits of your consecrations, with all your holy things.
