5 ναι. Ἐπὶ προσώπου τοῦ πεδίου πεσῇ, ὅτι ἐγὼ ἐλάλησα, λέγει
6 Κύριος Κύριος. Καὶ ἀποστελῶ πῦρ ἐπὶ (σὲ) Μαγώγ, καὶ κατοι-
        κισθήσονται αἱ νῆσοι ἐπ᾿ εἰρήνης, καὶ γνώσονται ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι
7 Κύριος. Καὶ τὸ ὄνομά μου τὸ ἅγιον γνωσθήσεται ἐν μέσω λαοῦ
        μου Ἰσραήλ, καὶ οὐ βεβηλωθήσεται τὸ ὄνομά μου τὸ ἅγιον οὐ-
        κέτι, καὶ γνώσονται πάντα τὰ ἔθνη, ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι Κύριος (Κύριος)
        ὁ ἅγιος ἐν Ἰσραήλ. Ἰδοὺ ἥκει, καὶ γνώσῃ ὅτι ἔσται, λέγει Κύριος
8 Κύριος ὁ Θεός· αὕτη ἐστιν ἡ ἡμέρα ἐν ᾗ ἐλάλησα, καὶ ἐξελεύσονται
9 οἱ κατοικοῦντες τὰς πόλεις Ἰσραήλ, καὶ καύσουσιν ἐν τοῖς ὅ-
        πλοις, πέλταις καὶ κοντοῖς, καὶ τόξοις καὶ τοξεύμασι, καὶ ῥά-
        βδοις χειρῶν, καὶ λόγχαις, καὶ καύσουσιν ἐν αὐτοῖς πῦρ ἑπτὰ
10 ἔτη, καὶ οὐ μὴ λάβωσι ξύλα ἐκ τοῦ πεδίου, οὐδὲ μὴ κόψωσιν
        ἐκ τῶν δρυμῶν, ἀλλ᾿ ἢ τὰ ὅπλα κατακαύσουσι πυρί· καὶ προνο-
        μεύσουσι τοὺς προνομεύσαντας αὐτοὺς, καὶ σκυλεύσουσι τοὺς σκυ-
11 λεύσαντας αὐτοὺς, λέγει Κύριος Κύριος. Καὶ ἔσται, ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ
        ἐκείνῃ δώσω τῷ Γὼγ τόπον ὀνομαστόν, μνημεῖον ἐν Ἰσραήλ,
        τὸ πολυάνδριον τῶν ἐπελθόντων πρὸς τὴν θάλασσαν, καὶ περι-
12 οἰκοδομήσουσι τὸ περιστόμιον τῆς φάραγγος, καὶ κατορύξουσιν
        ἐκεῖ τὸν Γὼγ καὶ πᾶν τὸ πλῆθος αὐτοῦ, καὶ κληθήσεται τὸ Γαὶ
        τὸ πολυάνδριον τοῦ Γώγ. Καὶ κατορύξουσιν αὐτοὺς οἶκος τοῦ
13 Ἰσραήλ, ἵνα καθαρισθῇ ἡ γῆ ἐν ἑπταμήνῳ, καὶ κατορύξουσιν αὐ-
        τοὺς πᾶς ὁ λαὸς τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἔσται αὐτοῖς εἰς ὀνομαστόν, ᾗ
14 ἡμέρᾳ (ᾗ) ἐδοξάσθην, λέγει Κύριος. Καὶ ἄνδρας διὰ παντὸς δια-
        στελοῦσιν ἐπιπορευομένους πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν, θάψαι τοὺς καταλε-
        λειμμένους ἐπὶ προσώπου τῆς γῆς, καθαρίσαι αὐτὴν μετὰ τὴν
15 ἑπτάμηνον, καὶ ἐκζητήσουσιν ἀκριβῶς. Καὶ ἔσται πᾶς ὁ διαπο-
        ρευόμενος πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν, καὶ ἰδὼν ὀστοῦν ἀνθρώπου οἰκοδομή-
        σει παρ᾿ αὐτῷ σημεῖον, ἕως ὅτου θάψωσιν αὐτὸ οἱ θάπτοντες εἰς
16 τὸ Γαὶ τὸ πολυάνδριον τοῦ Γώγ. Καὶ γὰρ τὸ ὄνομα τῆς πόλεως,
        πολυάνδριον· καὶ καθαρισθήσεται ἡ γῆ.
17 Καὶ σὺ υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου εἰπόν· τάδε λέγει Κύριος Κύριος· εἰπὸν παντὶ ὀρνέῳ πετεινῷ, καὶ πρὸς πάντα τὰ θηρία τοῦ ἀγροῦ, συνάχθητε καὶ ἔρχεσθε, συνά-
        χθητε ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν περικύκλῳ ἐπὶ τὴν θυσίαν μου, ἣν τέ-
        θυκα ὑμῖν θυσίαν μεγάλην ἐπὶ τὰ ὄρη Ἰσραήλ, καὶ φάγεσθε κρέα,
18 καὶ πίεσθε αἷμα. Κρέα γιγάντων φάγεσθε, καὶ αἷμα ἀρχόντων
        τῆς γῆς πίεσθε· κριοὺς καὶ μόσχους καὶ τράγους, καὶ οἱ μόσχοι

5 ...thou shalt fall upon the face of the field; for I have spoken, saith the Lord God.
6 And I will send fire upon [thee], O Magog, and upon them that dwell in peace in the isles; and they shall know that I am the Lord.
7 And My holy name shall be known in the midst of My people Israel; and My holy name shall be no more profaned. And all the nations shall know that I am the Lord, [yea, the] Lord, the Holy One in Israel. Behold, it cometh, and thou shalt know that it shall be, saith the Lord God.
8 This is the day whereof I have spoken.
9 And the inhabitants of the cities of Israel shall go forth, and they shall burn with the weapons, with shields and javelins, and with bows and arrows, and with hand-staves, and with spears; and they shall burn with them fire for seven years:
10 So that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither shall they cut down any out of the forests, but they shall burn the weapons with fire. And they shall spoil those that spoiled them, and plunder those that plundered them, saith the Lord God.
11 And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give unto Gog a notable place, a monument in Israel, even the Multitude of Graves of those who came toward the sea. And they shall build around the mouth of the valley, and they shall bury
12 there Gog and all his multitude. And it shall be called the Valley of the Multitude-Grave of Gog. And the house of Israel shall bury them,
13 that the land may be cleansed within seven months. And all the people of the land shall bury them, and it shall be unto them a renown, in the day wherein I was glorified, saith the Lord.
14 And they shall continually set apart men traversing all the land, to bury those left upon the face of the earth, to cleanse it after the
15 seven months; and they shall seek [them] out accurately. And it shall be that every one passing through all the land, and seeing a bone of a man, shall set a sign beside it, until those who bury shall bury it into
16 the Valley of the Multitude-Grave of Gog. For indeed the name of the city [shall be] Multitude of Graves; and the land shall be cleansed.
17 And thou, son of man, say: "Thus saith the Lord God: Speak unto every winged fowl, and unto all the beasts of the field, Assemble yourselves and come! Gather yourselves from all around unto My sacrifice, which I have prepared for you, a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh,
18 and drink blood. Ye shall eat the flesh of giants, and ye shall drink the blood of the princes of the earth; of rams and calves and goats; yea, and the calves
