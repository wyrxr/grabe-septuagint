42 Ἐπορεύθησαν ἐν ἀνύδροις ποταμοί. Ὅτι ἐμνήσθη τοῦ λόγου τοῦ
43 ἁγίου αὐτοῦ, τοῦ πρὸς Ἀβραὰμ τὸν δοῦλον αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐξήγαγε
44 τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ ἐν ἀγαλλιάσει, καὶ τοὺς ἐκλεκτοὺς αὐτοῦ ἐν εὐφροσύνῃ.
45 Καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς χώρας ἐθνῶν, καὶ πόνους λαῶν κατεκληρονόμησαν·
    ὅπως ἂν φυλάξωσι τὰ δικαιώματα αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὸν νόμον
    αὐτοῦ ἐκζητήσωσιν. Ἀλληλούϊα.

ΑΛΛΗΛΟΥΪΑ.
1 Ἐξομολογεῖσθε τῷ Κυρίῳ, ὅτι χρηστός, ὅτι εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τὸ
    ἔλεος αὐτοῦ.
2 Τίς λαλήσει τὰς δυναστείας τοῦ Κυρίου; ἀκουστὰς ποιήσει πάσας
    τὰς αἰνέσεις αὐτοῦ;
3 Μακάριοι οἱ φυλάσσοντες κρίσιν, καὶ ποιοῦντες δικαιοσύνην ἐν
    παντὶ καιρῷ.
4 Μνήσθητι ἡμῶν Κύριε ἐν τῇ εὐδοκίᾳ τοῦ λαοῦ σου, ἐπίσκεψαι
    ἡμᾶς ἐν τῷ σωτηρίῳ σου·
5 τοῦ ἰδεῖν ἐν τῇ χρηστότητι τῶν ἐκλεκτῶν σου, τοῦ εὐφρανθῆναι
    ἐν τῇ εὐφροσύνῃ τοῦ ἔθνους σου, τοῦ ἐπαινεῖσθαι μετὰ τῆς
    κληρονομίας σου.
6 Ἡμάρτομεν μετὰ τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν. ἠνομήσαμεν, ἠδικήσαμεν·
7 οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ οὐ συνῆκαν τὰ θαυμάσιά σου, οὐκ
    ἐμνήσθησαν τοῦ πλήθους τοῦ ἐλέους σου· καὶ παρεπίκραναν
    ἀναβαίνοντες ἐν θαλάσσῃ, ἐν τῇ ἐρυθρᾷ θαλάσσῃ.
8 Καὶ ἔσωσεν αὐτοὺς ἕνεκεν τοῦ ὀνόματος αὐτοῦ, τοῦ γνωρίσαι τὴν
    δυναστείαν αὐτοῦ·
9 καὶ ἐπετίμησε τῇ ἐρυθρᾷ θαλάσσῃ, καὶ ἐξηράνθη, καὶ ὡδήγησεν
    αὐτοὺς ἐν ἀβύσσοις ὡς ἐν ἐρήμῳ.
10 Καὶ ἔσωσεν αὐτοὺς ἐκ χειρὸς μισοῦντος, καὶ ἐλυτρώσατο αὐτοὺς
    ἐκ χειρὸς ἐχθροῦ.
11 Ἐκάλυψεν ὕδωρ τοὺς θλίβοντας αὐτούς· εἷς ἐξ αὐτῶν οὐχ
    ὑπελείφθη.
12 Καὶ ἐπίστευσαν ἐν τοῖς λόγοις αὐτοῦ, καὶ ᾖσαν τὴν αἴνεσιν
    αὐτοῦ.
13 Ἐτάχυναν, ἐπελάθοντο τῶν ἔργων αὐτοῦ· οὐχ ὑπέμειναν τὴν
    βουλὴν αὐτοῦ.
14 Καὶ ἐπεθύμησαν ἐπιθυμίαν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, καὶ ἐπείρασαν τὸν
    Θεὸν ἐν ἀνύδρῳ.
15 Καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς τὸ αἴτημα αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐξαπέστειλε πλησμονὴν
    εἰς τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτῶν.
16 Καὶ παρώργισαν τὸν Μωσῆν ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ, τὸν Ἀαρὼν τὸν
    ἅγιον Κυρίου·
17 ἠνοίχθη ἡ γῆ καὶ κατέπιε Δαθάν, καὶ ἐκάλυψεν ἐπὶ τὴν
    συναγωγὴν Ἀβειρών·
18 καὶ ἐξεκαύθη πῦρ ἐν τῇ συναγωγῇ αὐτῶν, φλὸξ κατέφλεξεν
    ἁμαρτωλούς.
19 Καὶ ἐποίησαν μόσχον ἐν Χωρήβ, καὶ προσεκύνησαν τῷ γλυπτῷ·
20 καὶ ἠλλάξαντο τὴν δόξαν αὐτῶν ἐν ὁμοιώματι μόσχου ἐσθίοντος
    χόρτον.

**PSALM CIV.** (conclusion)

42 Rivers flowed in the waterless places.
    For He remembered His holy word,
    [Which He spake] unto Abraham His servant.
43 And He brought forth His people with exultation,
    And His elect with gladness.
44 And He gave them the lands of the nations,
    And they inherited the labour of the peoples;
45 That they might keep His statutes,
    And seek after His law.
Hallelujah.

**PSALM CV.**

Hallelujah.
1 O give thanks unto the Lord; for He is good:
    For His mercy endureth for ever.
2 Who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord?
    Who can make all His praises to be heard?
3 Blessed are they that keep judgment,
    And do righteousness at all times.
4 Remember us, O Lord, in the favour [that Thou bearest unto] Thy people;
    O visit us with Thy salvation,
5 That we may see the prosperity of Thy chosen,
    That we may rejoice in the gladness of Thy nation,
    [And] that we may be glorified with Thine inheritance.
6 We have sinned with our fathers,
    We have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.
7 Our fathers in Egypt understood not Thy wondrous works;
    They remembered not the multitude of Thy mercies;
    But provoked [Thee] as they went up by the sea,
    Even by the Red Sea.
8 Nevertheless He saved them for His Name's sake,
    That He might make His mighty power to be known.
9 He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up:
    So He led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.
10 And He saved them from the hand of him that hated them,
    And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
11 The waters overwhelmed their oppressors:
    There was not one of them left.
12 Then believed they His words;
    They sang His praise.
13 They made haste, [and] forgot His works;
    They waited not for His counsel.
14 But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness,
    And tempted God in the dry land.
15 And He gave them their request,
    And sent abundance into their soul.
16 And they provoked Moses in the camp,
    [And] Aaron, the holy one of the Lord.
17 The earth opened and swallowed Dathan,
    And covered the company of Abiram.
18 And a fire was kindled in their company;
    The flame burned up the sinners.
19 They made a calf in Horeb,
    And worshipped the graven image.
20 Thus they changed their glory
    Into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.
