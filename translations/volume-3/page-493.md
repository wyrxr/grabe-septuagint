ἔξω· καὶ ἐξῆλθον Σεδράχ, Μισάχ, Ἀβδεναγώ, ἐκ μέσου τοῦ πυρός.
**27** Καὶ συνάγονται οἱ σατράπαι, καὶ οἱ στρατηγοί, καὶ οἱ τοπάρχαι, καὶ οἱ δυνάσται τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ ἐθεώρουν τοὺς ἄνδρας, ὅτι οὐκ ἐκυρίευσε τὸ πῦρ τοῦ σώματος αὐτῶν, καὶ ἡ θρὶξ τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτῶν οὐκ ἐφλογίσθη, καὶ τὰ σαράβαρα αὐτῶν οὐκ ἠλλοιώθη, καὶ ὀσμὴ πυρὸς οὐκ ἦν ἐν αὐτοῖς· καὶ προσεκύνησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν τῷ Κυρίῳ.
**28** Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Ναβουχοδονόσορ ὁ βασιλεύς, καὶ εἶπεν, εὐλογητὸς ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ Σεδράχ, Μισάχ, Ἀβδεναγώ, ὃς ἀπέστειλε τὸν ἄγγελον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐξείλατο τοὺς παῖδας αὐτοῦ, ὅτι ἐπεποίθεισαν ἐπ’ αὐτῷ· καὶ τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦ βασιλέως ἠλλοίωσαν, καὶ παρέδωκαν τὰ σώματα αὐτῶν εἰς πῦρ, ὅπως μὴ λατρεύσωσι μηδὲ προσκυνήσωσι παντὶ Θεῷ, ἀλλ’ ἢ τῷ Θεῷ αὐτῶν.
**29** Καὶ ἐγὼ ἐκτίθεμαι τὸ δόγμα· πᾶς λαὸς, φυλὴ, γλῶσσα, ἣ ἂν εἴπῃ βλασφημίαν κατὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ Σεδράχ, Μισάχ, Ἀβδεναγώ, εἰς ἀπώλειαν ἔσονται, καὶ οἱ οἶκοι αὐτῶν εἰς διαρπαγήν, καθότι οὐκ ἔστι Θεὸς ἕτερος, ὅστις δυνήσεται ῥύσασθαι οὕτως.
**30** Τότε κατεύθυνεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τὸν Σεδράχ, Μισάχ, Ἀβδεναγώ, ἐπὶ τὰ ἔργα ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ Βαβυλῶνος, καὶ ηὔξησεν αὐτούς· καὶ ἠξίωσεν αὐτοὺς ἡγεῖσθαι πάντων τῶν Ἰουδαίων, τῶν ὄντων ἐν τῇ βασιλεία αὐτοῦ.
**31** Ναβουχοδονόσορ ὁ βασιλεὺς πᾶσι τοῖς λαοῖς, φυλαῖς, καὶ γλώσσαις, τοῖς οἰκοῦσιν ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ, εἰρήνη ὑμῖν πληθυνθείη.
**32** Τὰ σημεῖα καὶ τὰ τέρατα ἃ ἐποίησε μετ’ ἐμοῦ ὁ Θεὸς ὁ ὕψιστος, ἤρεσεν ἐναντίον ἐμοῦ ἀναγγεῖλαι ὑμῖν, ὡς μεγάλα καὶ ἰσχυρά·
**33** ἡ βασιλεία αὐτοῦ, βασιλεία αἰώνιος, καὶ ἡ ἐξουσία αὐτοῦ εἰς γενεὰν καὶ γενεάν.

ΚΕΦ. Δ'. IV.
**1** Ἐγὼ Ναβουχοδονόσορ εὐθηνῶν ἤμην ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ μου, καὶ εὐθαλῶν ἐπὶ τοῦ θρόνου μου.
**2** Ἐνύπνιον εἶδον, καὶ ἐφοβέρισέ με, καὶ ἐταράχθην ἐπὶ τῆς κοίτης μου, καὶ αἱ ὁράσεις τῆς κεφαλῆς μου ἐτάραξάν με.
**3** Καὶ δι’ ἐμοῦ ἐτέθη δόγμα, τοῦ εἰσαγαγεῖν ἐνώπιόν μου πάντας τοὺς σοφοὺς Βαβυλῶνος, ὅπως τὴν σύγκρισιν τοῦ ἐνυπνίου γνωρίσωσί μοι.
**4** Καὶ εἰσεπορεύοντο οἱ ἐπαοιδοί, μάγοι, γαζαρηνοὶ, καὶ οἱ Χαλδαῖοι· καὶ τὸ ἐνύπνιον εἶπα ἐγὼ ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν·
**5** καὶ τὴν σύγκρισιν αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἐγνώρισάν μοι, ἕως οὗ ἦλθε

### Chapter 3

**26** ...forth; And Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came forth from the midst of the fire.
**27** And there were gathered together the satraps, and the commanders, and the district rulers, and the potentates of the king, and they beheld the men, that the fire had not had power over their bodies, neither was the hair of their head singed, nor were their tunics altered, nor was there any smell of fire upon them. And the king worshipped before them to the Lord.
**28** And Nebuchadnezzar the king answered and said, "Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent His angel, and delivered His servants, because they trusted in Him; and they changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies to the fire, that they might not serve nor worship any god, but their own God."
**29** "And I make a decree: that every people, nation, and tongue, which shall speak blasphemy against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be destroyed, and their houses shall be made a spoil; because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort."
**30** Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to positions in the province of Babylon, and advanced them; and he deemed them worthy to lead all the Jews that were in his kingdom.
**31** King Nebuchadnezzar unto all peoples, nations, and tongues, that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied unto you.
**32** The signs and wonders that the Most High God hath wrought with me, it hath seemed good unto me to declare unto you, how great and mighty they are;
**33** His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and His dominion endureth from generation to generation.

### Chapter 4

**1** I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at ease in my house, and flourishing upon my throne.
**2** I saw a dream, and it made me afraid; and I was troubled upon my bed, and the visions of my head disquieted me.
**3** And a decree was made by me, to bring in before me all the wise men of Babylon, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream.
**4** Then came in the enchanters, the magicians, the Gazarenes, and the Chaldeans; and I told the dream before them;
**5** but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof, until [Daniel] came...
