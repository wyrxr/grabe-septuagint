ΚΕΦ. ΚΔʹ. ΚΕʹ. ΙΕΖΕΚΙΗΛ 1371
ἐγὼ βεβηλῶ τὰ ἅγιά μου, φρύαγμα
ὀφθαλμῶν ὑμῶν, καὶ ὑπὲρ ὧν φείδονται
υἱοὶ ὑμῶν καὶ αἱ θυγατέρες ὑμῶν οὓς πεσοῦνται,
καὶ ποιήσετε ὃν τρόπον οὐ μὴ παρακληθήσεσθε, καὶ ἄρτον, αἱ κόμαι ὑμῶν ἐπὶ τῆς κεφαλῆς ὑμῶν, καὶ τὰ ὑποδήματα ὑμῶν
ἐν τοῖς ποσὶν ὑμῶν· οὐ μὴ κόψησθε, οὔτε μὴ κλαύσητε, καὶ ἐντακήσεσθε ἐν ταῖς ἀδικίαις ὑμῶν, καὶ παρακαλέσετε ἕκαστος τὸν
ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἔσται Ἰεζεκιὴλ ὑμῖν εἰς τέρας, κατὰ πάντα
ὅσα ἐποίησα, ποιήσετε, ὅταν ἔλθῃ ταῦτα, καὶ ἐπιγνώσεσθε διότι
ἐγὼ Ἀδωναὶ Κύριος. Καὶ σύ, υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, οὐχὶ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ
ὅταν λαμβάνω τὴν ἰσχὺν αὐτῶν παρ᾿ αὐτῶν, τὴν ἔπαρσιν τῆς
καυχήσεως αὐτῶν, τὰ ἐπιθυμήματα ὀφθαλμῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ τὴν
ἔπαρσιν τῆς ψυχῆς αὐτῶν, υἱοὺς αὐτῶν καὶ θυγατέρας αὐτῶν, ἐν
ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἥξει ὁ ἀνασωζόμενος πρός σε, τοῦ ἀναγγεῖλαί σοι
εἰς τὰ ὦτά σου. Ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ διανοιχθήσεται τὸ στόμα
σου πρός τὸν ἀνασωζόμενον, καὶ λαλήσεις, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἀποκωφωθῆς οὐκέτι, καὶ ἔσῃ αὐτοῖς εἰς τέρας, καὶ ἐπιγνώσονται διότι
ἐγὼ Κύριος.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΕʹ. XXV.

ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρός με, λέγων· υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου,
στήρισον τὸ πρόσωπόν σου ἐπὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἀμμὼν, καὶ προφήτευσον ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς, καὶ ἐρεῖς τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἀμμὼν· ἀκούσατε λόγον
Ἀδωναὶ Κυρίου· τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναὶ Κύριος· ἀνθ᾿ ὧν ἐπεχάρητε
ἐπὶ τὰ ἅγιά μου, ὅτι ἐβεβηλώθησαν, καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν τοῦ Ἰσραήλ,
ὅτι ἠφανίσθη, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον Ἰούδα, ὅτι ἐπορεύθησαν ἐν αἰχμαλωσίᾳ, διὰ τοῦτο ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ παραδίδωμι ὑμᾶς τοῖς υἱοῖς Κεδέμ
εἰς κληρονομίαν, καὶ κατασκηνώσουσι σὺν τῇ ἀπάρτιᾳ αὐτῶν ἐν
σοί, καὶ δώσουσιν ἐν σοὶ τὰ σκηνώματα αὐτῶν· αὐτοὶ φάγονται
τοὺς καρπούς σου, καὶ αὐτοὶ πίονται τὴν πιότητά σου. Καὶ δώσω
τὴν πόλιν τοῦ Ἀμμὼν εἰς νομὰς καμήλων, καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἀμμὼν εἰς νομὴν προβάτων, καὶ ἐπιγνώσεσθε διότι ἐγὼ Κύριος.
Διότι τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεός· ἀνθ' ὧν ἐκρότησας τὴν χεῖρά
σου, καὶ ἐπεφόρρησας τῷ ποδί σου, καὶ ἐπέχαρας ἐκ ψυχῆς σου
ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, διὰ τοῦτο ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐκτενῶ τὴν χεῖρά

**Chapter 24**

**21** I shall profane My sanctuary, the pride of your eyes, and that for which your sons and your daughters are solicitous, even they who shall fall.
**22** And ye shall do in such wise as ye shall not be comforted; and bread; your hair shall be upon your head, and your shoes upon your feet; ye shall not cut yourselves, neither shall ye weep; but ye shall pine away in your iniquities, and ye shall comfort each his brother.
**24** And Ezekiel shall be unto you a sign; according to all things which I have done, so shall ye do, when these things shall come to pass; and ye shall know that I am Adonai the Lord.
**25** And thou, son of man, shall it not be in that day when I take from them their strength, the lifting up of their boast, the desire of their eyes, and the pride of their soul, their sons and their daughters?
**26** In that day he that is saved shall come unto thee, to declare [it] in thine ears.
**27** In that day thy mouth shall be opened toward him that is saved, and thou shalt speak, and thou shalt be no longer dumb; and thou shalt be unto them a sign, and they shall know that I am the Lord.

**Chapter 25**

**1** AND the word of the Lord came unto me, saying:
**2** "Son of man, set thy face against the sons of Ammon, and prophesy against them,
**3** and say unto the sons of Ammon: 'Hear ye the word of Adonai the Lord! Thus saith Adonai the Lord: "Because ye rejoiced over My holy things, for they were profaned, and over the land of Israel, for it was laid waste, and over the house of Judah, for they went into captivity;
**4** therefore, behold, I deliver you unto the sons of Kedem for an inheritance; and they shall encamp with their full company within thee, and they shall set their dwellings within thee; they shall eat thy fruits, and they shall drink thy fatness.
**5** And I shall give the city of Ammon for a pasture of camels, and the sons of Ammon for a pasture of sheep; and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
**6** Because thus saith the Lord God: 'Forasmuch as thou hast clapped thine hand, and hast stamped with thy foot, and hast rejoiced with thy soul over the land of Israel,
**7** therefore, behold, I shall stretch forth the hand"
