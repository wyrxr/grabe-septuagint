14 λατε ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ, καὶ ἀκουστὸν ποιήσατε εἰς Μαγδωλόν, καὶ παραγγείλατε εἰς Μέμφιν, καὶ ἐν Τάφνας· εἴπατε, ἐπίστηθι, καὶ ἑτοίμασον σεαυτήν, ὅτι κατέφαγε μάχαιρα τὴν σμίλακά σου.
15 Διατί ἔφυγεν ὁ Ἄπις; ὁ μόσχος ὁ ἐκλεκτός σου οὐκ ἔμεινεν·
16 ὅτι ὁ Κύριος παρέλυσεν αὐτόν. Καὶ τὸ πλῆθός σου ἠσθένησε, καὶ ἔπεσε καὶ ἕκαστος πρὸς τὸν πλησίον αὑτοῦ ἐλάλουν· ἀναστῶμεν, καὶ ἀποστρέψωμεν πρὸς τὸν λαὸν ἡμῶν εἰς τὴν πατρίδα ἡμῶν,
17 ἀπὸ προσώπου μαχαίρας Ἑλληνικῆς. Καλέσατε τὸ ὄνομα Φαραὼ Νεχαὼ βασιλέως Αἰγύπτου,
18 Σαὼν Ἑσβεὶ Ἑμώδ. Ζῶ ἐγώ, λέγει βασιλεὺς Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τῶν δυνάμεων ὄνομα αὑτῷ· ὅτι ὡς τὸ Ἰταβύριον ἐν τοῖς ὄρεσι, καὶ ὡς ὁ Κάρμηλος ἐν τῇ θαλάσσῃ ἥξει.
19 Σκεύη ἀποικισμοῦ ποίησον σεαυτῇ, κατοικοῦσα θυγάτερ Αἰγύπτου, ὅτι Μέμφις εἰς ἀφανισμὸν ἔσται, καὶ κληθήσεται οὐαί,
20 διὰ τὸ μὴ ὑπάρχειν κατοικοῦντας ἐν αὐτῇ. Δάμαλις κεκαλλωπισμένη Αἴγυπτος, ἀπόσπασμα ἀπὸ βορρᾶ ἦλθεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτήν,
21 καὶ οἱ μισθωτοὶ αὐτῆς ἐν αὐτῇ, ὥσπερ μόσχοι σιτετοὶ τρεφόμενοι ἐν αὐτῇ· διότι καὶ οὗτοι ἀπεστράφησαν, καὶ ἔφυγον ὁμοθυμαδόν· οὐκ ἔστησαν, ὅτι ἡμέρα ἀπωλείας ἦλθεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτούς,
22 καὶ καιρὸς ἐκδικήσεως αὐτῶν. Φωνὴ αὐτῶν ὡς ὄφεως συρίζοντος, ὅτι ἐν ἄμμῳ πορεύσονται, ἐν ἀξίναις ἥξουσιν ἐπ᾿ αὐτήν.
23 Ὡς κόπτοντες ξύλα, ἐκκόψουσι τὸν δρυμὸν αὐτῆς, λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεός, ὅτι οὐ μὴ εἰκασθῇ, ὅτι ἐπλήθυνεν ὑπὲρ ἀκρίδα,
24 καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν αὐτοῖς ἀριθμός. Κατησχύνθη ἡ θυγάτηρ Αἰγύπτου,
25 παρεδόθη εἰς χεῖρας λαοῦ ἀπὸ βορρᾶ. Εἶπε Κύριος τῶν δυνάμεων ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐκδικῶ τὸν Ἄμμων τὸν υἱὸν αὐτῆς ἐπὶ Φαραὼ καὶ ἐπ᾿ Αἴγυπτον, καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς θεοὺς αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς βασιλεῖς αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐπὶ Φαραὼ καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς
26 πεποιθότας ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ. Καὶ παραδώσω αὐτοὺς εἰς χεῖρας ζητούντων τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐν χειρὶ Ναβουχοδονόσορ βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος, καὶ ἐν χειρὶ τῶν δούλων αὐτοῦ, καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα
27 ἠρεμήσει κατὰ τὰς ἡμέρας τὰς ἔμπροσθεν, φησὶ Κύριος. Σὺ δὲ μὴ φοβηθῇς, δοῦλός μου Ἰακώβ, μηδὲ πτοηθῇς, Ἰσραήλ· διότι ἐγὼ ἰδοὺ σώζων σε μακρόθεν, καὶ τὸ σπέρμα σου ἐκ τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας αὐτῶν· καὶ ἀναστρέψει Ἰακώβ, καὶ ἡσυχάσει καὶ ὑπνώσει,
28 καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ὁ παρενοχλῶν αὐτόν. Καὶ σὺ μὴ φοβοῦ παῖς μου Ἰακώβ, λέγει Κύριος, ὅτι μετὰ σοῦ ἐγώ εἰμι· ἡ ἀπόπτωσις

**Jeremiah 26**
(Hebrew Chapter 46)

**14** ...in Egypt, and make [it] heard in Migdol; and proclaim [it] in Memphis, and in Tahpanhes. Say ye, “Stand forth, and prepare thyself, for the sword hath devoured thy root.”
**15** Wherefore hath Apis fled? Thy chosen calf hath not remained;
**16** for the Lord hath paralyzed him. And thy multitude hath been made weak, and hath fallen, and each one spake unto his neighbor: “Let us arise, and let us return unto our people, unto our native land,
**17** from the face of the Grecian sword.” Call ye the name of Pharaoh Necho, the king of Egypt,
**18** “Saon Hesbei Hemod.” As I live, saith the King, the Lord God of hosts (whose name is His own): “For as Tabor among the mountains, and as Carmel by the sea, so shall he come.”
**19** Make for thyself vessels for exile, O inhabitant daughter of Egypt, for Memphis shall be brought to naught, and shall be called, “Woe!”
**20** Because there shall be none dwelling therein. Egypt is a fair heifer; a rending from the north hath come upon her,
**21** and her hired men within her are like stall-fed calves nurtured therein. For even these have turned back, and have fled with one accord; they stood not, for the day of their destruction hath come upon them,
**22** and the time of their vengeance. Their voice is like that of a serpent hissing; for they shall march in the sand, and with axes shall they come upon her.
**23** As those who cut wood, so shall they cut down her forest, saith the Lord God. For it shall not be likened, for it hath multiplied beyond the locusts,
**24** and there is no number unto them. The daughter of Egypt hath been put to shame,
**25** she hath been delivered into the hands of a people from the north. The Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, hath said: “Behold, I will execute judgment upon Amun, her son, against Pharaoh and against Egypt, and against her gods, and against her kings, and against Pharaoh and against them that trust in him.”
**26** And I will deliver them into the hands of them that seek their life, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants. And afterward,
**27** it shall rest as in the days of old, saith the Lord. But fear thou not, O Jacob My servant, neither be thou dismayed, O Israel; for, behold, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from their captivity. And Jacob shall return, and shall be at rest and at ease,
**28** and none shall make him afraid. And fear thou not, O Jacob My servant, saith the Lord, for I am with thee. For the downfall...
