### Chapter 4

**2** ...with judgment and with righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves in Him, and in Him shall they praise God in Jerusalem.
**3** For thus saith the Lord to the men of Judah, and to those that dwell in Jerusalem: Break up for yourselves fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.
**4** Circumcise yourselves unto your God, and take away the hardness of your heart, ye men of Judah, and ye that dwell in Jerusalem; lest My wrath go forth as fire, and burn, and there be none to quench it, because of the wickedness of your doings.
**5** Declare ye in Judah, and let it be heard in Jerusalem; say ye, "Signal with the trumpet upon the earth, cry out aloud, and say: Assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the fortified cities!"
**6** Gather up [your belongings], flee unto Zion; make haste, stand not still: for I bring forth evil from the north, even a great destruction.
**7** A lion is gone up from his thicket, a destroyer of nations hath lifted himself up, and is gone forth from his place, to make the land desolate; and cities shall be laid waste, so that none shall inhabit them.
**8** For these things, gird yourselves with sackcloth, and lament, and wail aloud; for the fierce wrath of the Lord is not turned back from you.
**9** And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, that the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall be amazed.
**10** Then said I, "Ah, Lord God! Surely Thou hast utterly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, 'Peace shall be unto you'; whereas the sword hath reached even unto their soul."
**11** At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem: "A wind of delusion [is] in the wilderness, the way of the daughter of My people, not for cleansing, nor for holiness."
**12** "A wind of fullness, from these [places] shall it come to Me; now also shall I speak judgments against them."
**13** Behold, as a cloud shall he ascend, and as a whirlwind his chariots; swifter than eagles are his horses: Woe unto us! for we are made miserable.
**14** Wash thy heart from wickedness, O Jerusalem, that thou mayest be saved; how long shall the thoughts of thy sorrows abide within thee?
**15** For a voice announcing from Dan shall come, and distress shall be heard from Mount Ephraim.
**16** Announce to the nations, behold, they come! Declare ye in Jerusalem: "Attackers come from a far land, and they have raised their voice against the cities of Judah."
**17** As keepers of a field, they are come against her all around; because thou hast neglected Me, saith the Lord.
**18** Thy ways and thy doings have brought these things upon thee; this is thy wickedness, because it is bitter, because it hath reached even unto thy heart.
