ματί μου ἐπ᾽ ἀδίκῳ· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ δίδωμι αὐτοὺς εἰς χεῖρας βασιλέως
Βαβυλῶνος, καὶ πατάξει αὐτοὺς κατ᾽ ὀφθαλμοὺς ὑμῶν.
22 Καὶ λήψονται ἀπ᾽ αὐτῶν κατάραν ἐν πάσι τῇ ἀποικίᾳ Ἰούδα ἐν
Βαβυλῶνι λέγοντες, ποιήσαι σε Κύριος, ὡς Σεδεκίαν ἐποίησε, καὶ
23 ὡς Ἀχιὰβ, οὓς ἀπεπηνγάνισε βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος ἐν πυρί, δι᾽ ἣν
ἐποίησαν ἀνομίαν ἐν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐμοιχεύοντο τὰς γυναῖκας τῶν
πολιτῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ λόγον ἐχρημάτισαν ἐν τῷ ὀνόματί μου ἀδί-
κων, ὃν οὐ συνέταξα αὐτοῖς, κἀγὼ εἰμι ὁ γνώστης καὶ μάρτυς,
φησὶ Κύριος.
24 Καὶ πρὸς Σαμαίαν τὸν Αἰλαμίτην ἐρεῖς, λέγων·
25 Τάδε λέγει Κύριος τῶν δυνάμεων ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ, λέγων· ἀνθ᾽ ὧν
οὐ ἀπέστειλας ἐν τῷ ὀνόματί μου τὰ βιβλία πρὸς πάντα τὸν λαὸν
ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ πρὸς Σοφονίαν υἱὸν Μασσαίου τὸν ἱερέα, καὶ
26 πρὸς πάντας τοὺς ἱερεῖς εἰπεῖν· Κύριος ἔδωκέ σε ἱερέα ἀντὶ Ἰω-
δαὲ τοῦ ἱερέως, γενέσθαι ἐπιστάτην ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ Κυρίου παντὶ
ἀνθρώπῳ προφητεύοντι, καὶ παντὶ ἀνθρώπῳ μαινομένῳ, καὶ δώ-
σεις αὐτὸν εἰς τὸ ἀπόκλεισμα, καὶ εἰς τὸν καταράκτην.
27 Καὶ νῦν διατί συνειλοιδωρήσατε Ἱερεμίαν τὸν ἐξ Ἀναθὼθ, τὸν προφη-
τεύσαντα ὑμῖν;
28 ῞Οτι διὰ τοῦτο ἀπέστειλε πρὸς ὑμᾶς εἰς Βαβυλῶνα, λέγων· μακράν
ἐστιν, οἰκοδομήσατε οἰκίας, καὶ κατοικήσατε, καὶ φυτεύσατε κήπους,
καὶ φάγεσθε τὸν καρπὸν αὐτῶν.
29 Καὶ ἀνέγνω Σοφονίας ὁ ἱερεὺς τὸ βιβλίον τοῦτο εἰς τὰ ὦτα Ἱερεμίου
τοῦ προφήτου.
30 Καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς Ἱερεμίαν, λέγων.
31 Ἀπόστειλον πρὸς πᾶσαν τὴν ἀποικίαν, λέγων· οὕτως εἶπε Κύ-
ριος ἐπὶ Σαμαίαν τὸν Αἰλαμίτην· ἐπειδὴ ἐπροφήτευσεν ὑμῖν
Σαμαίας, κἀγὼ οὐκ ἀπέστειλα αὐτὸν, καὶ πεποιθέναι ἐποίη-
32 σεν ὑμᾶς ἐπ᾽ ἀδίκῳ, διὰ τοῦτο οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος · ἰδοὺ
ἐγὼ ἐπισκέψομαι ἐπὶ Σαμαίαν τὸν Αἰλαμίτην, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸ γένος
αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται αὐτῶν ἄνθρωπος καθήμενος ἐν μέσω ὑμῶν,
τοῦ ἰδεῖν τὰ ἀγαθὰ, ἃ ἐγὼ ποιήσω ὑμῖν, οὐκ ἔξονται, λέγει Κύ-
ριος, ὅτι ἔκκλισιν ἐλάλησε κατὰ τοῦ Κυρίου.

**JEREMIAH CHAPTER 36**

**21** ...falsely in My Name: behold, I will give them into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he shall strike them down before your very eyes.
**22** And from them shall a curse be taken up among all the captivity of Judah in Babylon, saying: "The Lord make thee as He made Zedekiah, and
**23** as Ahab, whom the king of Babylon put to a fiery death; for the iniquity which they wrought in Israel, and because they committed adultery with the wives of their fellow citizens, and spoke a word of injustice in My Name, which I commanded them not. And I am the Knower and the Witness," saith the Lord.
**24** And unto Shemaiah the Elamite shalt thou speak, saying:
**25** "Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, saying: 'Because thou hast not sent, in My Name, the letters unto all the people who are in Jerusalem, and unto Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and
**26** unto all the priests, to say: "The Lord hath given thee [to be] a priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, to be a governor in the House of the Lord over every man who prophesieth, and over every man who feigneth madness; and thou shalt put him into the stocks, and into the dungeon."
**27** And now, why have ye reviled Jeremiah of Anathoth, who hath prophesied unto you?
**28** Because for this cause he hath sent unto you to Babylon, saying: "It is far [off]; build ye houses, and dwell therein, and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them."'"
**29** And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet.
**30** Then the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah, saying:
**31** "Send unto all the captivity, saying: 'Thus saith the Lord concerning Shemaiah the Elamite: Because Shemaiah hath prophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and hath caused you to trust in injustice;
**32** therefore thus saith the Lord: "Behold, I will visit upon Shemaiah the Elamite, and upon his seed; and there shall not be a man of them sitting among you, to see the good things which I shall do unto you; they shall not come forth," saith the Lord, "because he hath spoken a turning away against the Lord."'"

(Hebrew Chapter 30)
