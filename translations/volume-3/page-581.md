ΖΑΧΑΡΙΑΣ.
ΚΕΦ. Ζ΄. VII.

ΚΑὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ τετάρτῳ ἔτει, ἐπὶ Δαρείου τοῦ βασιλέως, 1
ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς Ζαχαρίαν τῇ τετράδι καὶ εἰκάδι τοῦ
μηνὸς τοῦ ἐνάτου, ὅς ἐστι Χασελεύ. Καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν εἰς Βαιθήλ, 2
Σαρασὰρ καὶ Ἀρβεσέερ ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες αὐτοῦ, τοῦ
ἐξιλάσασθαι τὸν Κύριον, λέγων πρὸς τοὺς ἱερεῖς τοὺς ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ 3
Κυρίου παντοκράτορος, καὶ πρὸς τοὺς προφήτας λέγων· εἰ
εἰσελήλυθεν ὧδε τὸ ἁγίασμα ἐν τῷ μηνὶ τῷ πέμπτῳ, καθότι
ἐποίησα ἤδη ἱκανὰ ἔτη. Καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου τῶν δυνάμεων 4
πρὸς μέ, λέγων· εἰπὲ πρὸς πάντα τὸν λαὸν τῆς γῆς, καὶ πρὸς 5
τοὺς ἱερεῖς, λέγων· ἐὰν νηστεύσητε ἢ κόψησθε ἐν ταῖς πέμπταις
ἢ ἐν ταῖς ἑβδόμαις, (καὶ ἰδοὺ ἑβδομήκοντα ἔτη) μὴ νηστείαν
νενηστεύκατέ μοι; καὶ ἐὰν φάγητε καὶ πίητε, οὐχ ὑμεῖς ἐσθίετε 6
καὶ ὑμεῖς πίνετε; Οὐχ οὗτοι οἱ λόγοι εἰσίν, οὓς ἐλάλησε Κύριος 7
ἐν χερσὶ τῶν προφητῶν τῶν ἔμπροσθεν, ὅτε ἦν Ἱερουσαλὴμ
κατοικουμένη, καὶ εὐθηνοῦσα, καὶ αἱ πόλεις αὐτῆς κυκλόθεν αὐτῆς,
καὶ ἡ ὀρεινὴ καὶ ἡ πεδινὴ κατῳκεῖτο; Καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου 8
πρὸς Ζαχαρίαν, λέγων· τάδε λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ· κρίμα 9
δίκαιον κρίνατε, καὶ ἔλεος καὶ οἰκτιρμὸν ποιεῖτε ἕκαστος πρὸς
τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ χήραν καὶ ὀρφανὸν καὶ προσήλυτον 10
καὶ πένητα μὴ καταδυναστεύετε, καὶ κακίαν ἕκαστος τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ
αὐτοῦ μὴ μνησικακείτω ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ὑμῶν. Καὶ ἠπείθησαν 11
τοῦ προσέχειν, καὶ ἔδωκαν νῶτον παραφρονοῦντα, καὶ τὰ ὦτα
αὐτῶν ἐβάρυναν τοῦ μὴ εἰσακούειν, καὶ τὴν καρδίαν αὐτῶν ἔταξαν 12
ἀπειθῆ τοῦ μὴ εἰσακοῦσαι τοῦ νόμου μου καὶ τοὺς λόγους, οὓς
ἐξαπέστειλε Κύριος παντοκράτωρ ἐν πνεύματι αὐτοῦ ἐν χερσὶ τῶν
προφητῶν τῶν ἔμπροσθεν· καὶ ἐγένετο ὀργὴ μεγάλη παρὰ Κυρίου
παντοκράτορος. Καὶ ἔσται ὃν τρόπον εἶπε, καὶ οὐκ εἰσήκουσαν 13
αὐτοῦ, οὕτως κεκράξονται, καὶ οὐ μὴ εἰσακούσω αὐτῶν, λέγει Κύριος
παντοκράτωρ. Καὶ ἐκβαλῶ αὐτοὺς εἰς πάντα τὰ ἔθνη, ἃ οὐκ 14
ἔγνωσαν, καὶ ἡ γῆ ἀφανισθήσεται κατόπισθεν αὐτῶν ἐκ διοδεύοντος
καὶ ἐξ ἀναστρέφοντος· καὶ ἔταξαν γῆν ἐκλεκτὴν εἰς ἀφανισμόν.

**Zechariah [Chapter] 7.**

**1** And it came to pass in the fourth year of Darius the king, that the word of the Lord came unto Zechariah on the four and twentieth [day] of the ninth month, which is Chislev.
**2** And Sharezer and Arbeseer the king and his men sent unto Bethel to entreat the Lord,
**3** saying unto the priests who were in the house of the Lord Almighty, and unto the prophets, saying, "If this sacred observance hath come hither in the fifth month, as I have done already [these] sufficient years."
**4** Then the word of the Lord of Hosts came unto me, saying,
**5** "Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, 'When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth [month] and in the seventh [month] (and behold, these seventy years), did ye by any means fast unto Me?
**6** And when ye eat and when ye drink, do ye not yourselves eat and yourselves drink?
**7** Are not these the words which the Lord spake by the hand of the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous, and her cities round about her, and the hill country and the plain were inhabited?'"
**8** And the word of the Lord came unto Zechariah, saying,
**9** "Thus saith the Lord Almighty: Execute true judgment, and show mercy and compassion every man to his brother;
**10** and oppress not the widow, nor the orphan, nor the sojourner, nor the poor; and let none of you bear malice against his brother in your hearts.
**11** But they refused to hearken, and gave a stubborn shoulder, and made their ears dull, that they might not hear;
**12** and they made their hearts rebellious, that they should not hear My law and the words which the Lord Almighty had sent by His Spirit, by the hand of the former prophets; and there was great wrath from the Lord Almighty.
**13** And it shall be, that as He spake, and they would not hear Him, so shall they cry, and I will by no means hear them, saith the Lord Almighty.
**14** And I will scatter them among all the nations whom they knew not, and the land shall be desolated behind them, [so that no one passeth] from him that passeth through and from him that returneth; and they appointed the chosen land for desolation."
