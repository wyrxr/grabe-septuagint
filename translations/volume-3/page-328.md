1266                                 ΙΕΡΕΜΙΑΣ ΚΕΦ. ΚΗ΄. ΚΘ΄.
      Ὅτι ἐὰν ὀχυρώσῃ ὕψος ἰσχύος αὐτῆς, παρ’ ἐμοῦ ἥξουσιν ἐξολεθρεύ-
54 οντες αὐτήν, λέγει Κύριος. Φωνὴ κραυγῆς ἐν Βαβυλῶνι, καὶ συν-
55 τριβὴ μεγάλη ἐκ γῆς Χαλδαίων, ὅτι ἐξωλόθρευσε Κύριος τὴν Βα-
56 βυλῶνα, καὶ ἀπώλεσεν ἀπ’ αὐτῆς φωνὴν μεγάλην ἠχοῦσαν ὡς ὕδα-
      τα πολλά· ἔδωκεν εἰς ὄλεθρον φωνὴν αὐτῆς. Ὅτι ἦλθεν ἐπὶ Βαβυ-
57 λῶνα ταλαιπωρία, ἐάλωσαν οἱ μαχηταὶ αὐτῆς, ἐπτόηται τὸ τόξον
      αὐτῶν, ὅτι ὁ Θεὸς ἀνταποδίδωσιν αὐτοῖς. Κύριος ἀνταποδίδωσιν
      αὐτῇ τὴν ἀνταπόδοσιν· καὶ μεθύσει μέθῃ τοὺς ἡγεμόνας αὐτῆς,
      καὶ τοὺς σοφοὺς αὐτῆς, καὶ τοὺς ἄρχοντας αὐτῆς, καὶ τοὺς στρα-
      τηγοὺς αὐτῆς, καὶ τοὺς δυνατοὺς αὐτῆς, καὶ ὑπνώσουσιν ὕπνον
58 αἰώνιον, καὶ μὴ ἐξεγερθῶσι, λέγει ὁ βασιλεύς, Κύριος παντο-
      κράτωρ ὄνομα αὐτῷ. Τάδε λέγει Κύριος· τεῖχος Βαβυλῶνος
      ἐπλατύνθη, κατασκαπτόμενον κατασκαφήσεται, καὶ αἱ πύλαι αὐ-
      τῆς αἱ ὑψηλαὶ ἐμπυρισθήσονται, καὶ οὐ κοπιάσουσι λαοὶ εἰς κε-
59 νόν, καὶ ἔθνη ἐν ἀρχῇ ἐκλείψουσιν. Ο ΛΟΓΟΣ ΟΝ ΕΝΕΤΕΙ-
      ΛΑΤΟ ΚΥΡΙΟΣ ΙΕΡΕΜΙΑ ΤΩ ΠΡΟΦΗΤΗ, εἰπεῖν τῷ Σαραίᾳ
      υἱῷ Νηρείου, υἱοῦ Μασσαίου, ὅτε ἐπορεύετο παρὰ Σεδε-
      χίου βασιλέως Ἰούδα εἰς Βαβυλῶνα, ἐν τῷ τετάρτῳ ἔτει τῆς
60 βασιλείας αὐτοῦ, καὶ Σαραίας ἄρχων δώρων. Καὶ ἔγραφεν Ἱε-
      ρεμίας πάντα τὰ κακά, ἃ ἥξει ἐπὶ Βαβυλῶνα, ἐν βιβλίῳ ἑνί,
      πάντας τοὺς λόγους τούτους τοὺς ἐγγεγραμμένους ἐπὶ Βαβυλῶνα.
61 Καὶ εἶπεν Ἱερεμίας πρὸς Σαραίαν· ὅταν ἔλθῃς εἰς Βαβυλῶνα,
62 καὶ ἔσῃ καὶ ἀναγνώσῃ πάντας τοὺς λόγους τούτους, καὶ ἐρεῖς,
      Κύριε, Κύριε, σὺ ἐλάλησας ἐπὶ τὸν τόπον τοῦτον, τοῦ ἐξολε-
      θρεῦσαι αὐτὸν, καὶ τοῦ μὴ εἶναι ἐν αὐτῷ κατοικοῦντας ἀπὸ ἀν-
63 θρώπου ἕως κτήνους, ὅτι ἀφανισμὸς εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα ἔσται. Καὶ
      ἔσται ὅταν παύσῃ τοῦ ἀναγινώσκειν τὸ βιβλίον τοῦτο, καὶ ἐπι-
      θήσεις ἐπ’ αὐτὸ λίθον, καὶ ῥίψεις αὐτὸ εἰς μέσον τοῦ Εὐφρά-
64 του, καὶ ἐρεῖς, οὕτως καταδύσεται Βαβυλὼν, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἀναστῇ
      ἀπὸ προσώπου τῶν κακῶν. ὧν ἐγὼ ἐπάγω ἐπ’ αὐτήν. Καὶ ἔστησαν
      ἐνταῦθα οἱ λόγοι Ἱερεμίου.

                                    ΚΕΦ. ΚΘ΄. ΧΧΙΧ.
                      (Hebr. Caput XLVII. et pars Capitis XLIX.)
1 ἘΠΙ ΤΟΥΣ ΑΛΛΟΦΥΛΟΥΣ ὡς ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς
      Ἱερεμίαν τὸν προφήτην, πρὸ τοῦ πατάξαι Φαραὼ τὴν Γάζαν.

**Jeremiah, Chapter 28**
(Hebrew Chapter 51)

**53** For though she fortify the height of her strength, from Me shall come forth those who shall destroy her, saith the Lord.
**54** A voice of a cry [is heard] in Babylon, and a great shattering from the land of the Chaldeans,
**55** For the Lord hath utterly destroyed Babylon, and hath caused a great voice to cease from her, a voice resounding as many waters; He hath delivered her voice unto destruction.
**56** For distress hath come upon Babylon; her warriors are captured, their bow is dismayed;
**57** For God repayeth them. The Lord repayeth her her recompense, and He shall make drunk with drunkenness her rulers, and her wise men, and her governors, and her captains, and her mighty men; and they shall sleep an eternal sleep, and shall not awake,
**58** Saith the King, whose name is the Lord Almighty. Thus saith the Lord: The wall of Babylon, though made broad, being dug down, shall be utterly dug down; and her high gates shall be set on fire, and peoples shall not labour in vain,
**59** And nations shall fail in [their] beginning. THE WORD WHICH THE LORD COMMANDED JEREMIAH THE PROPHET, to speak unto Seraiah, the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he journeyed with Zedekiah, king of Judah, to Babylon, in the fourth year of his reign; and Seraiah was chief of gifts.
**60** And Jeremiah wrote all the evils which should come upon Babylon in one book, even all these words which were written concerning Babylon.
**61** And Jeremiah said unto Seraiah, When thou shalt come into Babylon,
**62** And thou shalt be [there], and shalt read all these words, then shalt thou say, O Lord, O Lord, Thou hast spoken concerning this place, to utterly destroy it, and that there should be no inhabitants therein, from man unto beast;
**63** For it shall be a desolation for ever. And it shall be, when thou hast ceased to read this book, that thou shalt place a stone upon it, and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates,
**64** And shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall by no means rise from the face of the evils which I bring upon her. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.

**Jeremiah, Chapter 29**
(Hebrew Chapter 47 and part of Chapter 49)

**1** CONCERNING THE PHILISTINES. The word of the Lord which came unto Jeremiah the prophet, before Pharaoh smote Gaza.
