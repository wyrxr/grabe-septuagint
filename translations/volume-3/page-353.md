ΚΕΦ. Μ'. ΜΑ΄.                                         ΙΕΡΕΜΙΑΣ 1291
σεται, Κύριος δικαιοσύνη ἡμῶν. Ὅτι τάδε λέγει Κύριος· οὐκ 17
ἐξολοθρευθήσεται τῷ Δαβὶδ ἀνὴρ καθήμενος ἐπὶ θρόνου οἴκου
Ἰσραήλ· καὶ τοῖς ἱερεῦσι τοῖς Λευίταις οὐκ ἐξολοθρευθήσεται ἀνὴρ 18
ἐκ προσώπου μου, ἀναφέρων ὁλοκαύτωμα, καὶ θυμιῶν θυσίαν,
καὶ ποιῶν θῦμα πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας. Καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου 19
πρὸς Ἱερεμίαν, λέγων· Τάδε λέγει Κύριος· εἰ διασκεδασθήσεται 20
ἡ διαθήκη μου τῆς ἡμέρας, καὶ ἡ διαθήκη μου τῆς νυκτός, τοῦ μὴ
εἶναι ἡμέραν καὶ νύκτα ἐν τῷ καιρῷ αὐτῶν, καί γε ἡ διαθήκη μου 21.
διασκεδασθήσεται ἡ μετὰ Δαβὶδ τοῦ δούλου μου, τοῦ μὴ εἶναι αὐ-
τῷ υἱὸν βασιλεύοντα ἐπὶ τοῦ θρόνου αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἡ πρὸς τοὺς ἱε-
ρεῖς καὶ τοὺς Λευίτας τοὺς λειτουργοῦντάς μοι. Ὡς οὐκ ἐξαριθ- 22
μηθήσεται ἡ δύναμις τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, οὐδὲ ἐκμετρηθήσεται ἡ ἄμμος
τῆς θαλάσσης· οὕτω πληθυνῶ τὸ σπέρμα Δαβὶδ τοῦ δούλου μου,
καὶ τοὺς Λευίτας τοὺς λειτουργοῦντάς μοι. Καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος 23
Κυρίου πρὸς Ἱερεμίαν, λέγων· ἆρά γε οὐκ εἶδες τί ὁ λαὸς οὗτος 24
ἐλάλησε, λέγων· αἱ δύο πατριαί, ἃς ἐξελέξατο Κύριος ἐν αὐ-
ταῖς, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἀπώσατο αὐτάς· καὶ παρώξυναν τὸν λαόν μου,
τοῦ μὴ εἶναι ἔθνος ἔτι ἐνώπιον μου. Τάδε λέγει Κύριος· εἰ μὴ 25
διαθήκην μου ἡμέρας καὶ νυκτός, ἀκριβάσματα οὐρανοῦ καὶ γῆς
οὐκ ἔταξα, καί γε τὸ σπέρμα Ἰακὼβ καὶ Δαβὶδ τοῦ δούλου 26
μου ἀποδοκιμῶ, τοῦ μὴ λαβεῖν ἄρχοντας ἐκ τοῦ σπέρματος αὐτοῦ
πρὸς τὸ σπέρμα Ἀβραάμ, καὶ Ἰσαάκ, καὶ Ἰακώβ· ἔτι ἐπιστρέ-
ψω τὴν ἀποστροφὴν αὐτῶν, καὶ οἰκτειρῶ αὐτούς.

Ὁ Λόγος ὁ γενόμενος πρὸς Ἱερεμίαν παρὰ Κυρίου, (καὶ Να- 1
βουχοδονόσορ βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος, καὶ πᾶν τὸ στρατόπεδον αὐ-
τοῦ, καὶ πᾶσαι αἱ βασιλεῖαι τῆς γῆς τῆς ἀρχῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντες
οἱ λαοὶ ἐπολέμουν ἐπὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἐπὶ πάσας τὰς πόλεις Ἰού-
δα) λέγων· οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ· βάδισον, εἰπὲ 2
πρὸς Σεδεκίαν βασιλέα Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐρεῖς αὐτῷ· οὕτως εἶπε Κύ-
ριος· παραδόσει παραδοθήσεται ἡ πόλις αὕτη εἰς χεῖρας βασιλέως
Βαβυλῶνος, καὶ συλλήψεται αὐτήν, καὶ καύσει αὐτὴν ἐν
πυρί. Καὶ σὺ οὐ μὴ σωθῇς ἐκ χειρὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ συλληφθῇ 3
συλληφθήσῃ, καὶ εἰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ δοθήσῃ· καὶ οἱ ὀφθαλμοί

**JEREMIAH 33**

**16** ...be called, The Lord our Righteousness.
**17** For thus saith the Lord: There shall not be cut off from David a man sitting upon the throne of the house of Israel;
**18** nor unto the priests [and] the Levites shall there be cut off from My presence a man offering up burnt offering, and burning incense [as] a sacrifice, and making oblation all the days.
**19** Moreover the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah, saying:
**20** Thus saith the Lord: If My covenant of the day, and My covenant of the night, shall be dissolved, [so that] there shall not be day and night in their season,
**21** then shall My covenant also be dissolved, [even that] with David My servant, [so that] he shall not have a son reigning upon his throne, and that with the priests and the Levites who minister unto Me.
**22** As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither can the sand of the sea be measured; so will I multiply the seed of David My servant, and the Levites who minister unto Me.
**23** Moreover the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah, saying:
**24** Hast thou not seen what this people hath spoken, saying, "The two families which the Lord chose among them, behold, He hath cast them away"? And they have provoked My people, [so that it should] no more be a nation before Me.
**25** Thus saith the Lord: If [there be not] My covenant of day and night, and if I have not ordained the ordinances of heaven and earth,
**26** then shall I also reject the seed of Jacob and David My servant, that I should not take rulers from his seed for the seed of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob; but yet will I restore their captivity, and have mercy upon them.

**JEREMIAH 34**

**1** The word which came unto Jeremiah from the Lord, (when Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion, and all the peoples, fought against Jerusalem and against all the cities of Judah,) saying:
**2** Thus saith the Lord God of Israel: Go, speak unto Zedekiah, king of Judah, and thou shalt say unto him, "Thus saith the Lord: This city shall assuredly be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it, and burn it with fire.
**3** And thou shalt by no means escape from his hand, but thou shalt be captured and taken captive, and thou shalt be given into his hands; and thine eyes..."
