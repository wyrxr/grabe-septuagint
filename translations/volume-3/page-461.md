ἐστεατωμένοι πάντες, καὶ φάγεσθε στέαρ εἰς πλησμονήν, καὶ πίε- 19
σθε αἷμα εἰς μέθην ἀπὸ τῆς θυσίας μου, ἧς ἔθυσα ὑμῖν, Καὶ ἐμ- 20
πλησθήσεσθε ἐπὶ τῆς τραπέζης μου, ἵππον καὶ ἀναβάτην, γίγαντα
καὶ πάντα ἄνδρα πολεμιστήν, λέγει Κύριος Κύριος. Καὶ δώσω 21
τὴν δόξαν μου ἐν ὑμῖν, καὶ ὄψονται πάντα τὰ ἔθνη τὴν κρίσιν
μου ἣν ἐποίησα, καὶ τὴν χεῖρά μου ἣν ἐπήγαγον ἐπ’ αὐτούς, καὶ 22
γνώσονται οἶκος Ἰσραήλ, ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς αὐτῶν,
ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης καὶ ἐπέκεινα. Καὶ γνώσονται πάντα τὰ 23
ἔθνη, ὅτι διὰ τὰς ἁμαρτίας αὐτῶν ἠχμαλωτεύθησαν οἶκος Ἰσραήλ,
ἀνθ’ ὧν ἠθέτησαν εἰς ἐμέ, καὶ ἀπέστρεψα τὸ πρόσωπόν μου ἀπ’
αὐτῶν, καὶ παρέδωκα αὐτοὺς εἰς χεῖρας τῶν ἐχθρῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ
ἔπεσον πάντες μαχαίρᾳ, κατὰ τὰς ἀκαθαρσίας αὐτῶν, καὶ κατὰ 24
τὰ ἀνομήματα αὐτῶν ἐποίησα αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἀπέστρεψα τὸ πρόσωπόν
μου ἀπ’ αὐτῶν. Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Κύριος Κύριος ὁ Θεός· νῦν 25
ἀναστρέψω τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν Ἰακώβ, καὶ ἐλεήσω τὸν οἶκον Ἰσ-
ραήλ, καὶ ζηλώσω διὰ τὸ ὄνομα τὸ ἅγιόν μου. Καὶ λήψονται τὴν 26
ἀτιμίαν αὐτῶν, καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν ἀδικίαν αὐτῶν, ἣν ἠδίκησαν ἐν τῷ
κατοικισθῆναι αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν ἐπ’ εἰρήνης· καὶ οὐκ ἔ-
σται ὁ ἐκφοβῶν ἐν τῷ ἀποστρέψαι με αὐτοὺς ἐκ τῶν ἐθνῶν, καὶ συ- 27
ναγαγεῖν με αὐτοὺς ἐκ τῶν χωρῶν τῶν ἐθνῶν· καὶ ἁγιασθήσομαι ἐν
αὐτοῖς ἐνώπιον ἐθνῶν πολλῶν· καὶ γνώσονται ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι Κύριος ὁ 28
Θεὸς αὐτῶν, ἐν τῷ ἐπιφανῆναί με αὐτοῖς ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι· καὶ συνάξω
αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν, καὶ οὐ καταλείψω ἀπ’ αὐτῶν οὐκέτι
ἐκεῖ· καὶ οὐκ ἀποστρέψω οὐκέτι τὸ πρόσωπόν μου ἀπ’ αὐτῶν, ἀνθ’ ὧν 29
ἐξέχεα τὸν θυμόν μου ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον Ἰσραήλ, λέγει Κύριος Κύριος.

ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ πέμπτῳ καὶ εἰκοστῷ ἔτει τῆς αἰχμα- 1
λωσίας ἡμῶν, ἐν τῷ πρώτῳ μηνί, δεκάτῳ τοῦ μηνός, ἐν τῷ τεσ-
σαρεσκαιδεκάτῳ ἔτει, μετὰ τὸ ἀλωθῆναι τὴν πόλιν, ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ
ἐκείνῃ ἐγένετο χεὶρ Κυρίου ἐπ’ ἐμέ, καὶ ἤγαγέ με ἐκεῖ, ἐν ὁρά- 2
σει Θεοῦ εἰς τὴν γῆν τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἔθηκε με ἐπ’ ὄρους ὑψη-
λοῦ σφόδρα, καὶ ἐπ’ αὐτοῦ ὡσεὶ οἰκοδομὴ πόλεως ἀπέναντι, καὶ 3
εἰσήγαγέ με ἐκεῖ· καὶ ἰδοὺ ἀνήρ, καὶ ἡ ὅρασις αὐτοῦ ἦν ὡσεὶ
ὅρασις χαλκοῦ στίλβοντος, καὶ ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ ἦν σπαρτίον

19 ...all of them fattened; and ye shall eat fat unto satiety, and ye shall drink blood unto drunkenness from My sacrifice, which I have prepared for you.
20 And ye shall be filled at My table with [the flesh of] horse and rider, [of] giant and every man of war, saith the Lord God.
21 And I will set My glory among you; and all the nations shall behold My judgment which I have executed, and My hand which I have laid upon them.
22 And the house of Israel shall know that I am the Lord their God, from that day forth and evermore.
23 And all the nations shall know that the house of Israel was led captive for their iniquities, because they transgressed against Me. And I turned My face from them, and delivered them into the hands of their enemies; and they all fell by the sword.
24 According to their uncleannesses and according to their lawless deeds I dealt with them, and turned My face from them.
25 Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Now will I reverse the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the house of Israel, and will be jealous for My holy Name.
26 And they shall bear their shame, and all their injustice wherein they dealt unjustly, when they dwelt in their land in peace; and none shall make them afraid when I shall bring them back from the nations,
27 and gather them from the lands of the nations; and I shall be sanctified in them in the sight of many nations.
28 And they shall know that I am the Lord their God, in that I manifested Myself unto them among the nations. And I will gather them to their own land, and will leave none of them there anymore.
29 And I will no longer turn My face from them, because I have poured out My wrath upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord God.

**Chapter 40**

1 And it came to pass in the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the first month, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was taken, in that selfsame day the hand of the Lord was upon me, and brought me thither.
2 In the visions of God, unto the land of Israel, and set me upon a mountain exceedingly high; and upon it was as the structure of a city over against [me].
3 And He brought me thither, and behold, a Man, whose appearance was as the appearance of shining bronze; and in His hand was a measuring line of flax.
