ΖΑΧΑΡΙΑΣ.
ΚΕΦ. Ηʹ. VIII.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου παντοκράτορος, λέγων· τάδε λέ-
2 γει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ· ἐζήλωσα τὴν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ τὴν
3 Σιὼν ζῆλον μέγαν, καὶ θυμῷ μεγάλῳ ἐζήλωσα αὐτήν. Τάδε
λέγει Κύριος· καὶ ἐπιστρέψω ἐπὶ Σιών, καὶ κατασκηνώσω ἐν
μέσῳ Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ κληθήσεται Ἱερουσαλήμ πόλις ἀληθινή,
4 καὶ τὸ ὄρος Κυρίου παντοκράτορος ὄρος ἅγιον. Τάδε λέγει Κύ-
ριος παντοκράτωρ· ἔτι καθήσονται πρεσβύτεροι καὶ πρεσβύτεραι
ἐν ταῖς πλατείαις Ἱερουσαλήμ, ἕκαστος τὴν ῥάβδον αὐτοῦ ἔχων
5 ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ πλήθους ἡμερῶν· καὶ αἱ πλατεῖαι τῆς πό-
λεως πλησθήσονται παιδαρίων καὶ κορασίων παιζόντων ἐν ταῖς
6 πλατείαις αὐτῆς. Τάδε λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ· διότι εἰ
ἀδυνατήσει ἐνώπιον τῶν καταλοίπων τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου ἐν ταῖς
ἡμέραις ἐκείναις, μὴ καὶ ἐνώπιον ἐμοῦ ἀδυνατήσει; λέγει Κύριος
παντοκράτωρ. Τάδε λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἀνα-
σώζω τὸν λαόν μου ἀπὸ γῆς ἀνατολῶν καὶ ἀπὸ γῆς δυσμῶν,
8 καὶ εἰσάξω αὐτούς, καὶ κατασκηνώσω ἐν μέσῳ Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ
ἔσονταί μοι εἰς λαόν, καὶ ἐγὼ ἔσομαι αὐτοῖς εἰς Θεὸν ἐν ἀλη-
9 θείᾳ καὶ δικαιοσύνῃ. Τάδε λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ· κατι-
σχυέτωσαν αἱ χεῖρες ὑμῶν τῶν ἀκουόντων ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ταύ-
ταις τοὺς λόγους τούτους ἐκ στόματος τῶν προφητῶν, ἀφ᾽ ἧς
ἡμέρας τεθεμελίωται ὁ οἶκος Κυρίου παντοκράτορος, καὶ ὁ ναὸς
10 ἀφ᾽ οὗ ᾠκοδόμηται. Διότι πρὸ τῶν ἡμερῶν ἐκείνων ὁ μισθὸς τῶν
ἀνθρώπων οὐκ ἔσται εἰς ὄνησιν, καὶ ὁ μισθὸς τῶν κτηνῶν οὐχ
ὑπάρχει, καὶ τῷ ἐκπορευομένῳ καὶ τῷ εἰσπορευομένῳ οὐκ ἔσται
εἰρήνη ἀπὸ τῆς θλίψεως, καὶ ἐξαποστελῶ πάντας τοὺς ἀνθρώπους,
11 ἕκαστον ἐπὶ τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ. Καὶ νῦν οὐ κατὰ τὰς ἡμέρας
12 τὰς ἔμπροσθεν ἐγὼ ποιῶ τοῖς καταλοίποις τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου, λέ-
γει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ, ἀλλ᾽ ἢ δείξω εἰρήνην· ἡ ἄμπελος δώ-
σει τὸν καρπὸν αὐτῆς, καὶ ἡ γῆ δώσει τὰ γεννήματα αὐτῆς, καὶ
ὁ οὐρανὸς δώσει τὴν δρόσον αὐτοῦ, καὶ κατακληρονομήσω τοῖς
13 καταλοίποις, τοῦ λαοῦ μου τούτου πάντα ταῦτα. Καὶ ἔσται, ὃν
τρόπον ἦτε ἐν κατάρᾳ ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν οἶκος Ἰούδα καὶ ὁ οἶκος
Ἰσραήλ, οὕτως διασώσω ὑμᾶς, καὶ ἔσεσθε ἐν εὐλογίᾳ· θαρσεῖτε

**Zechariah [Chapter] 8.**

**1** And the word of the Lord Almighty came, saying,
**2** "Thus saith the Lord Almighty: I have been jealous for Jerusalem with a great jealousy, and with great fury have I been jealous for her.
**3** Thus saith the Lord: I will return unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and Jerusalem shall be called The City of Truth, and the mountain of the Lord Almighty, The Holy Mountain.
**4** Thus saith the Lord Almighty: There shall yet sit old men and old women in the broad places of Jerusalem, every man with his staff in his hand by reason of great age;
**5** and the broad places of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the broad places thereof.
**6** Thus saith the Lord Almighty: If it be marvelous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days, should it also be marvelous in My eyes? saith the Lord Almighty.
**7** Thus saith the Lord Almighty: Behold, I will save My people from the land of the east, and from the land of the west;
**8** and I will bring them, and I will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be My people, and I will be their God in truth and in righteousness.
**9** Thus saith the Lord Almighty: Let your hands be strengthened, ye that hear in these days these words from the mouth of the prophets, from the day that the house of the Lord Almighty was founded, and the temple since it was built.
**10** For before those days there shall be no profit from the hire of men, nor shall there be any hire for beasts; and to him that goeth out and to him that cometh in there shall be no peace because of the affliction; and I will send forth all men, every man against his neighbour.
**11** But now I do not deal with the remnant of this people according to the former days, saith the Lord Almighty,
**12** but rather I will show forth peace; the vine shall give her fruit, and the ground shall give her increase, and the heaven shall give its dew; and I will cause the remnant of My people to inherit all these things.
**13** And it shall be, that as ye were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I save you, and ye shall be a blessing. Fear ye not,
