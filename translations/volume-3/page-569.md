ΚΕΦ. Α΄. Β΄. ΣΟΦΟΝΙΑΣ. 1507
σουσιν οἰκίας, καὶ οὐ μὴ κατοικήσουσιν ἐν αὐταῖς, καὶ καταφυ-
τεύσουσιν ἀμπελῶνας, καὶ οὐ μὴ πίωσιν τὸν οἶνον αὐτῶν. Ὅτι 14
ἐγγὺς ἡ ἡμέρα Κυρίου ἡ μεγάλη, ἐγγὺς καὶ ταχεῖα σφόδρα·
φωνὴ ἡμέρας Κυρίου πικρὰ καὶ σκληρὰ τέτακται· δυνατὴ ἡμέ- 15
ρα ὀργῆς, ἡ ἡμέρα ἐκείνη, ἡμέρα θλίψεως καὶ ἀνάγκης, ἡμέρα
ἀωρίας καὶ ἀφανισμοῦ, ἡμέρα σκότους καὶ γνόφου, ἡμέρα νε-
φέλης καὶ ὁμίχλης, ἡμέρα σάλπιγγος καὶ κραυγῆς ἐπὶ τὰς πό- 16
λεις τὰς ὀχυράς, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς γωνίας τὰς ὑψηλάς. Καὶ ἐκθλί- 17
ψω τοὺς ἀνθρώπους, καὶ πορεύσονται ὡς τυφλοί, ὅτι τῷ Κυ-
ρίῳ ἐξήμαρτον· καὶ ἐκχεεῖ τὸ αἷμα αὐτῶν ὡς χοῦν, καὶ τὰς
σάρκας αὐτῶν ὡς βόλβιτα· καὶ τὸ ἀργύριον αὐτῶν καὶ τὸ χρυ- 18
σίον αὐτῶν οὐ μὴ δύνηται ἐξελέσθαι αὐτοὺς ἐν ἡμέρα ὀργῆς Κυ-
ρίου. Καὶ ἐν πυρὶ ζήλου αὐτοῦ καταναλωθήσεται πᾶσα ἡ γῆ·
διότι συντέλειαν καὶ σπουδὴν ποιήσει ἐπὶ πάντας τοὺς κατοικοῦν-
τας τὴν γῆν.

ΚΕΦ. Β΄. ΙΙ.

ΣΥΝΑΧΘΗΤΕ, καὶ συνδέθητε τὸ ἔθνος τὸ ἀπαίδευτον, πρὸ 1. 2
τοῦ γενέσθαι ὑμᾶς ὡς ἄνθος παραπορευόμενον, πρὸ τοῦ ἐπελ-
θεῖν ἐφ᾽ ὑμᾶς ὀργὴν Κυρίου, πρὸ τοῦ ἐπελθεῖν ἐφ᾽ ὑμᾶς ἡμέραν
θυμοῦ Κυρίου. Ζητήσατε τὸν Κύριον πάντες ταπεινοὶ γῆς· κρί- 3
μα ἐργάζεσθε, καὶ δικαιοσύνην ζητήσατε, καὶ ἀποκρίνεσθε αὐτά,
ὅπως σκεπασθῆτε ἐν ἡμέρα ὀργῆς Κυρίου. Διότι Γάζα διηρπα- 4
σμένη ἔσται, καὶ Ἀσκαλὼν ἔσται εἰς ἀφανισμόν, καὶ Ἄζωτος
μεσημβρίας ἐκριζωθήσεται, καὶ Ἀκκαρὼν ἐκριζωθήσεται. Οὐαὶ οἱ 5
κατοικοῦντες τὸ σχοίνισμα τῆς θαλάσσης, πάροικοι Κρητῶν· λό-
γος Κυρίου πρὸς ὑμᾶς Χαναάν, γῆ ἀλλοφύλων, καὶ ἀπολῶ ὑμᾶς
ἐκ κατοικίας. καὶ ἔσται Κρήτη νομὴ ποιμνίων, καὶ μάνδρα προ- 6
βάτων, καὶ ἔσται, τὸ σχοίνισμα τῆς θαλάσσης τοῖς καταλοίποις 7
οἴκου Ἰούδα· ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς νεμήσονται ἐν τοῖς οἴκοις Ἀσκαλῶνος,
δείλης καταλύσουσιν ἀπὸ προσώπου υἱῶν Ἰούδα· ὅτι ἐπέσκεπται
αὐτοὺς Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς αὐτῶν, καὶ ἀπέστρεψε τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν
αὐτῶν. Ἤκουσα ὀνειδισμοὺς Μωάβ, καὶ κονδυλισμοὺς υἱῶν Ἀμ- 8
μῶν, ἐν οἷς ὠνείδιζον τὸν λαόν μου, καὶ ἐμεγαλύνοντο ἐπὶ τὰ
ὅριά μου. Διὰ τοῦτο ζῶ ἐγώ, λέγει Κύριος τῶν δυνάμεων ὁ Θεὸς 9
Ἰσραήλ, διότι Μωὰβ ὡς Σόδομα ἔσται, καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Ἀμμὼν ὡς

**CHAPTER 1.**

**13** ...but they shall build houses, and shall not inhabit therein; and they shall plant vineyards, but shall not drink the wine thereof.

**14** For the great Day of the Lord is nigh, it is nigh and hasteth greatly; the voice of the Day of the Lord is bitter and harsh, [and] is established.

**15** A day of might and wrath is that day, a day of trouble and distress, a day of ruin and utter destruction, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of cloud and thick fog.

**16** A day of the trumpet and of alarm against the fortified cities, and against the high battlements.

**17** And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk as blind men, because they have sinned against the Lord; and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as dung.

**18** Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the Day of the Lord's wrath. But with the fire of His jealousy shall all the earth be consumed; for He shall make a swift and utter end of all them that dwell upon the earth.

**CHAPTER 2.**

**1-2** Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation without discipline; before ye become as a passing flower, before the wrath of the Lord come upon you, before the day of the Lord's anger come upon you.

**3** Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, who work judgment; seek righteousness, and make answer concerning these [things], that ye may be hid in the day of the Lord's wrath.

**4** For Gaza shall be utterly plundered, and Ashkelon shall be laid waste; and Ashdod shall be rooted out at noon, and Ekron shall be rooted out.

**5** Woe unto them that dwell in the portion of the sea coast, the sojourners of the Cretans! The word of the Lord is against you, O Canaan, thou land of foreigners; and I will destroy you from [your] habitation.

**6** And Crete shall be a pasture for flocks, and a fold for sheep.

**7** And the portion of the sea coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; upon them shall they feed, and in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lodge in the evening; for the Lord their God hath visited them, and hath turned back their captivity.

**8** I have heard the reproaches of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, whereby they have reproached My people, and magnified themselves against My borders.

**9** Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as...
