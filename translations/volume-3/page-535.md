ἰσχύν, καὶ ταλαιπωρίαν ἐπὶ ὀχύρωμα ἐπάγων. Ἐμίσησαν ἐν πύ- 10
λαις ἐλέγχοντα, καὶ λόγον ὅσιον ἐβδελύξαντο· διὰ τοῦτο ἀνθ’ 11
ὧν κατεκονδυλίζετε πτωχόν, καὶ δῶρα ἐκλεκτὰ ἐδέξασθε παρ’ αὐ- 12
τῶν, οἴκους ξυστοὺς ᾠκοδομήσατε, καὶ οὐ μὴ κατοικήσητε ἐν αὐ- 13
τοῖς, καὶ ἀμπελῶνας ἐπιθυμητοὺς ἐφυτεύσατε, καὶ οὐ μὴ πίητε
τὸν οἶνον αὐτῶν. Ὅτι ἔγνων πολλὰς ἀσεβείας ὑμῶν, καὶ ἰσχυ- 14
ραὶ αἱ ἁμαρτίαι ὑμῶν· καταπατοῦντες δίκαιον, λαμβάνοντες ἀλ-
λάγματα, καὶ πένητας ἐν πύλαις ἐκκλίνοντες. Διὰ τοῦτο ὁ συν- 15
ἰὼν ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ σιωπήσεται, ὅτι καιρὸς πονηρός ἐστιν.
Ἐζητήσατε τὸ καλόν, καὶ μὴ τὸ πονηρόν, ὅπως ζήσητε, καὶ 16
ἔσται οὕτως μεθ’ ὑμῶν Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὁ παντοκράτωρ· ὃν τρό-
πον εἴπατε· μεμισήκαμεν τὸ πονηρόν, καὶ ἠγαπήκαμεν τὸ καλόν· 17
καὶ ἀποκαταστήσατε ἐν πύλαις κρῖμα, ὅπως ἐλεήσῃ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς
ὁ παντοκράτωρ τοὺς περιλοίπους τοῦ Ἰωσήφ. Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε 18
λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὁ παντοκράτωρ· ἐν πάσαις πλατείαις κοπε-
τός, καὶ ἐν πάσαις ὁδοῖς θρηνήσεται, οὐχί, οὐαί· κληθήσεται γεωρ-
γὸς εἰς πένθος καὶ κοπετόν, καὶ εἰς εἰδότας θρῆνον, καὶ ἐν πά- 19
σαις ὁδοῖς κοπετός, διότι διελεύσομαι διὰ μέσου σου, εἶπε Κύριος.
Οὐαὶ οἱ ἐπιθυμοῦντες τὴν ἡμέραν Κυρίου· ἵνατί αὕτη ὑμῖν ἡ ἡμέ- 20
ρα τοῦ Κυρίου; καὶ αὕτη ἐστὶ σκότος καὶ οὐ φῶς. Ὃν τρόπον 19
ὅταν ἐκφύγῃ ἄνθρωπος ἐκ προσώπου τοῦ λέοντος, καὶ ἐμπέσῃ αὐ-
τῷ ἡ ἄρκος, καὶ εἰσπηδήσῃ εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὑτοῦ, καὶ ἀπερείσῃ
τὰς χεῖρας αὑτοῦ ἐπὶ τὸν τοῖχον, καὶ δάκῃ αὐτὸν ὄφις. Οὐχὶ 20
σκότος ἡ ἡμέρα τοῦ Κυρίου, καὶ οὐ φῶς; καὶ γνόφος οὐκ ἔχων
φέγγος αὑτῇ; Μεμίσηκα, ἀπώσμαι ἑορτὰς ὑμῶν, καὶ οὐ μὴ 21
ὀσφρανθῶ θυσίας ἐν ταῖς πανηγύρεσιν ὑμῶν· διότι καὶ ἐὰν ἐνέγ- 22
κητέ μοι τὰ ὁλοκαυτώματα καὶ θυσίας ὑμῶν, οὐ προσδέξομαι αὐ- 23
τά, καὶ σωτηρίου ἐπιφανείας ὑμῶν οὐκ ἐπιβλέψομαι· μετάστη- 24
σον ἀπ’ ἐμοῦ ἦχον ᾠδῶν σου, καὶ ψαλμὸν ὀργάνων σου οὐκ ἀκού-
σομαι· καὶ κυλισθήσεται ὡς ὕδωρ κρῖμα, καὶ δικαιοσύνη ὡς χει- 25
μάῤῥους ἄβατος. Μὴ σφάγια καὶ θυσίας προσηνέγκατέ μοι ἐν 26
τῇ ἐρήμῳ οἶκος Ἰσραὴλ τεσσαράκοντα ἔτη, λέγει Κύριος; Καὶ 27
ἀνελάβετε τὴν σκηνὴν τοῦ Μολόχ, καὶ τὸ ἄστρον τοῦ Θεοῦ ὑμῶν
Ῥαιφάν, τοὺς τύπους οὓς ἐποιήσατε ἑαυτοῖς· καὶ μετοικιῶ ὑμᾶς 28
ἐπέκεινα Δαμασκοῦ, λέγει Κύριος, ὁ Θεὸς ὁ παντοκράτωρ ὄνομα
αὐτῷ.

**CHAPTER 5**

**9** [He that divideth] destruction upon strength, and bringeth misery upon a fortress.
**10** They have hated him that reproveth in the gates, and the holy word have they abhorred;
**11** Therefore, forasmuch as ye have struck down the poor, and have received choice gifts from them, ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell therein, and desirable vineyards have ye planted, but ye shall not drink the wine thereof.
**12** For I know your many iniquities, and your sins are strong; ye who trample upon the righteous, receiving bribes, and turning aside the poor in the gates.
**13** Therefore he that is prudent shall keep silence in that time, for it is an evil time.
**14** Seek ye that which is good, and not that which is evil, that ye may live; and so shall the Lord, the God Almighty, be with you; in the same manner as ye have said: "We have hated the evil, and we have loved the good;"
**15** And restore judgment in the gates, that the Lord, the God Almighty, may have mercy upon the remnant of Joseph.
**16** Therefore thus saith the Lord, the God Almighty: In all the broad ways there shall be lamentation, and in all the streets shall there be wailing, [yea, woe]; the husbandman shall be called to mourning and lamentation, and to those skilled in dirges, and in all the streets there shall be lamentation; for I will pass through the midst of thee, saith the Lord.
**17** Woe unto them that desire the day of the Lord! To what end is this day of the Lord for you? And this day is darkness, and not light.
**18** In such wise as when a man fleeth from the face of a lion, and a bear falleth upon him; and he leapeth into his house, and resteth his hands upon the wall, and a serpent biteth him.
**19** Shall not the day of the Lord be darkness, and not light? Yea, thick darkness, having no brightness in it?
**20** I have hated, I have spurned your feasts, and I will not smell [the aroma of] your sacrifices in your solemn assemblies; for even if ye bring Me your burnt offerings and your sacrifices, I will not accept them, and upon the manifestation of your peace offering I will not look with favor.
**21** Remove from Me the sound of thy songs, and the melody of thy instruments I will not hear.
**22** But let judgment roll down as water, and righteousness as a torrent that cannot be passed over.
**23** Did ye bring unto Me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness for forty years, O house of Israel? saith the Lord.
**24** Yea, but ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Rephan, the figures which ye made for yourselves;
**25** And I will cause you to be carried away beyond Damascus, saith the Lord, the God Almighty is His Name.
