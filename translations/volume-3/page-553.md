ΚΕΦ. Γ΄. Ι Ω Η Λ. 1491
6 καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἀπέδοτε τοῖς υἱοῖς τῶν Ἑλλήνων, ὅπως
ἐξώσητε αὐτοὺς ἐκ τῶν ὁρίων αὐτῶν. Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐγείρω αὐτοὺς ἐκ 7
τοῦ τόπου, οὗ ἀπέδοσθε αὐτοὺς ἐκεῖ, καὶ ἀνταποδώσω τὸ ἀνταπό-
δομα ὑμῶν εἰς κεφαλὰς ὑμῶν· καὶ ἀποδώσομαι τοὺς υἱοὺς ὑμῶν 8
καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας εἰς χεῖρας υἱῶν Ἰούδα, καὶ ἀποδώσονται αὐ-
τοὺς εἰς αἰχμαλωσίαν εἰς ἔθνος μακρὰν ἀπέχον, ὅτι Κύριος ἐλά-
λησε. Κηρύξατε ταῦτα ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν, ἁγιάσατε πόλεμον, ἐξ- 9
εγείρατε τοὺς μαχητάς, προσαγάγετε καὶ ἀναβαίνετε πάντες ἄν-
δρες πολεμισταί· ἐγκόψατε τὰ ἄροτρα ὑμῶν εἰς ῥομφαίας, καὶ 10
τὰ δρέπανα ὑμῶν εἰς σειρομάστας· ὁ ἀδύνατος λεγέτω, ὅτι ἰσχύω
ἐγώ. Συναθροίζεσθε καὶ εἰσπορεύεσθε πάντα τὰ ἔθνη κυκλόθεν 11
καὶ συνάχθητε ἐκεῖ· ὁ πρᾳὺς ἔστω μαχητής· ἐγειρέσθωσαν καὶ 12
ἀναβαινέτωσαν πάντα τὰ ἔθνη εἰς τὴν κοιλάδα Ἰωσαφάτ, διότι
ἐκεῖ καθιῶ τοῦ διακρῖναι πάντα τὰ ἔθνη κυκλόθεν. Ἐξαποστεί- 13
λατε δρέπανα, ὅτι παρέστηκεν ὁ τρυγητός· εἰσπορεύεσθε, πα-
τεῖτε, διότι πλήρης ἡ ληνός, ὑπερεκχεῖται τὰ ὑπολήνια, ὅτι πε-
πλήθυνται τὰ κακὰ αὐτῶν. Ἤχοι ἐξήχησαν ἐν τῇ κοιλάδι τῆς δί- 14
κης, διότι ἐγγὺς ἡ ἡμέρα Κυρίου ἐν τῇ κοιλάδι τῆς δίκης. Ὁ 15
ἥλιος καὶ ἡ σελήνη συσκοτάσουσι, καὶ οἱ ἀστέρες δύσουσι τὸ φέγ-
γος αὐτῶν. Ὁ δὲ Κύριος ἐκ Σιὼν ἀνακράξεται, καὶ ἐξ Ἱερου- 16
σαλὴμ δώσει φωνὴν αὑτοῦ· καὶ σεισθήσεται ὁ οὐρανὸς καὶ ἡ γῆ,
ὁ δὲ Κύριος φείσεται τοῦ λαοῦ αὑτοῦ, καὶ ἐνισχύσει τοὺς υἱοὺς
Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἐπιγνώσεσθε, διότι ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν, ὁ κα- 17
τασκηνῶν ἐν Σιὼν ὄρει ἁγίῳ μου· καὶ ἔσται Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἁγία,
καὶ ἀλλογενεῖς οὐ διελεύσονται δι᾽ αὑτῆς οὐκέτι. Καὶ ἔσται ἐν 18
τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἀποσταλάξει τὰ ὄρη γλυκασμόν, καὶ οἱ βουνοὶ
ῥυήσονται γάλα, καὶ πᾶσαι αἱ ἀρέσεις Ἰούδα ῥυήσονται ὕδατα·
καὶ πηγὴ ἐξ οἴκου Κυρίου ἐξελεύσεται, καὶ ποτιεῖ τὸν χειμάρ-
ῥουν τῶν σχοίνων. Αἴγυπτος εἰς ἀφανισμὸν ἔσται, καὶ ἡ Ἰδου- 19
μαία εἰς πεδίον ἀφανισμοῦ ἔσται ἐξ ἀδικιῶν υἱῶν Ἰούδα, ἀνθ᾽ ὧν
ἐξέχεαν αἷμα δίκαιον ἐν τῇ γῇ αὑτῶν· ἡ δὲ Ἰουδαία εἰς τὸν 20
αἰῶνα κατοικηθήσεται, καὶ Ἱερουσαλὴμ εἰς γενεὰς γενεῶν. Καὶ 21
ἐκδικήσω τὸ αἷμα αὐτῶν, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἀθωώσω· καὶ Κύριος κα-
τασκηνώσει ἐν Σιών.

#### Chapter 3

**6** and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto the sons of the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from their own border.
**7** Behold, I will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold them; and I will recompense your deed upon your own heads.
**8** And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to a nation far off, for the Lord hath spoken [it].
**9** Proclaim ye this among the nations; prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near, let them come up!
**10** Beat your ploughshares into swords, and your sickles into threshing sledges; let the weak man say, ‘I am strong!’
**11** Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye nations, round about, and gather yourselves together thither; let the meek one be a warrior.
**12** Let the nations be wakened, and come up to the Valley of Jehoshaphat: for there will I sit to judge all the nations round about.
**13** Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe; come, get you down, for the winepress is full, the vats overflow; for their wickedness is great.
**14** A great clamor hath arisen in the Valley of Decision, for the Day of the Lord is near in the Valley of Decision.
**15** The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their shining.
**16** The Lord also shall roar out of Zion, and utter His voice from Jerusalem; and the heaven and the earth shall shake: but the Lord will spare His people, and will strengthen the sons of Israel.
**17** So shall ye know that I am the Lord your God dwelling in Zion, My holy mountain: then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no strangers pass through her any more.
**18** And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down sweetness, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the watercourses of Judah shall flow with waters; and a fountain shall come forth of the house of the Lord, and shall water the torrent of the reeds.
**19** Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate plain, for the injustices against the children of Judah, because they have shed righteous blood in their land.
**20** But Judah shall dwell for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation.
**21** And I will avenge their blood, and will not leave [it] unpunished; for the Lord dwelleth in Zion.
