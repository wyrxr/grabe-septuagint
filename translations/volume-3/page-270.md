ΚΕΦ. ΞΔ΄. LXIV.
κατακαύσει πῦρ τοὺς ὑπεναντίους, καὶ φανερὸν ἔσται τὸ ὄνομά
σου ἐν τοῖς ὑπεναντίοις σου· ἀπὸ προσώπου σου ἔθνη ταραχθή-
3 σονται, ὅταν ποιῇς τὰ ἔνδοξα· τρόμος λήψεται ἀπὸ σοῦ ὄρη.
4 Ἀπὸ τοῦ αἰῶνος οὐκ ἠκούσαμεν, οὐδὲ οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ ἡμῶν ἴδον
5 Θεὸν πλὴν σοῦ, καὶ τὰ ἔργα σου, ἃ ποιήσεις τοῖς ὑπομένου-
6 σιν ἔλεον. Συναντήσεται γὰρ ἔλεος τοῖς ποιοῦσι τὸ δίκαιον, καὶ
7 τῶν ὁδῶν σου μνησθήσονται· ἰδοὺ σὺ ὠργίσθης, καὶ ἡμεῖς ἡμάρ-
8 τομεν· διὰ τοῦτο ἐπλανήθημεν, καὶ ἐγενήθημεν ὡς ἀκάθαρτοι
πάντες ἡμεῖς, καὶ ὡς ῥάκος ἀποκαθημένης πᾶσα ἡ δικαιοσύνη
9 ἡμῶν· καὶ ἐξερύημεν ὡς φύλλα πάντες ἡμεῖς, διὰ τὰς ἀνομίας
10 ἡμῶν· οὕτως ἄνεμος οἴσει ἡμᾶς, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ὁ ἐπικαλούμενος
11 τὸ ὄνομά σου, καὶ ὁ μνησθεὶς ἀντιλαβέσθαι σου· ὅτι ἀπέστρεψας
12 τὸ πρόσωπόν σου ἀφ᾿ ἡμῶν, καὶ παρέδωκας ἡμᾶς διὰ τὰς ἁμαρ-
13 τίας ἡμῶν. Καὶ νῦν, Κύριε, πατὴρ ἡμῶν σύ, ἡμεῖς δὲ πηλός,
14 καὶ σὺ πλάστης ἡμῶν· ἔργον τῶν χειρῶν σου πάντες ἡμεῖς.
15 Μὴ ὀργίζου ἡμῖν, Κύριε, ἕως σφόδρα, καὶ μὴ ἐν καιρῷ μνη-
16 σθῇς ἁμαρτιῶν ἡμῶν· καὶ νῦν ἐπίβλεψον, ὅτι λαός σου πάντες
17 ἡμεῖς. Πόλις τοῦ ἁγίου σου ἐγενήθη ἔρημος, Σιὼν ὡς ἔρημος
18 ἐγενήθη, Ἱερουσαλὴμ εἰς κατάραν. Ὁ οἶκος τὸ ἅγιον ἡμῶν
19 καὶ ἡ δόξα ἣν ηὐλόγησαν οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν, ἐγενήθη πυρίκαυ-
20 στος, καὶ πάντα τὰ ἔνδοξα ἡμῶν συνέπεσε. Καὶ ἐπὶ πᾶσι
21 τούτοις ἀνέσχου, Κύριε, καὶ ἐσιώπησας, καὶ ἐταπείνωσας ἡμᾶς
22 ἕως σφόδρα.

ΚΕΦ. ΞΕ΄. LXV.
23 Ἐμφανὴς ἐγενόμην τοῖς ἐμὲ μὴ ἐπερωτῶσιν, εὑρέθην τοῖς
24 ἐμὲ μὴ ζητοῦσιν· εἶπα, ἰδοὺ εἰμι, ἰδοὺ εἰμι, τῷ ἔθνει, οἵ τινες
25 οὐκ ἐκάλεσαν τὸ ὄνομά μου. Ἐξεπέτασα τὰς χεῖράς μου ὅλην
26 τὴν ἡμέραν πρὸς λαὸν ἀπειθοῦντα καὶ ἀντιλέγοντα, οἳ οὐκ
27 ἐπορεύθησαν ὁδῷ ἀληθινῇ, ἀλλ᾿ ὀπίσω τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν αὑτῶν,
28 ὁ λαὸς οὗτος ὁ παροξύνων με ἐναντίον ἐμοῦ διαπαντός· αὐτοὶ
29 θυσιάζουσιν ἐν τοῖς κήποις, καὶ θυμιῶσιν ἐπὶ ταῖς πλίνθοις τοῖς
30 δαιμονίοις, ἃ οὐκ ἔστιν. Ἐν τοῖς μνήμασι, καὶ ἐν τοῖς σπη-
31 λαίοις κοιμῶνται δι᾿ ἐνύπνια, οἱ ἔσθοντες κρέας ὕειον, καὶ ζωμὸν
32 θυσιῶν· μεμολυμμένα πάντα τὰ σκεύη αὑτῶν, οἱ λέγοντες,
33 πόρρω ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ, μὴ ἐγγίσης μοι, ὅτι καθαρός εἰμι·

#### Chapter 64

**2** ...and fire shall burn up Thine adversaries,
    and Thy Name shall be made manifest among Thine enemies.
    At Thy presence, nations shall be troubled;
**3** when Thou doest glorious things,
    a trembling shall seize the mountains from before Thee.
**4** From the beginning of the age we have not heard,
    nor have our eyes seen any God save Thee,
**5** and Thy works, which Thou shalt perform for those
    who await [Thy] mercy.
**6** For mercy shall meet those who do righteousness,
    and they shall remember Thy ways.
    Behold, Thou wast wroth, and we have sinned;
**7** therefore have we strayed,
**8** and we are become as unclean, all of us;
    and all our righteousness is as the rag of a menstruous woman.
**9** And we have all withered as leaves,
    because of our iniquities;
    thus shall the wind carry us away.
**10** And there is none that calleth upon Thy Name,
    and none that hath remembered to lay hold of Thee;
**11** for Thou hast turned away Thy face from us,
    and Thou hast delivered us because of our sins.
**12** But now, O Lord, Thou art our Father;
    we are but clay,
**13** and Thou art our Potter;
    we are all the work of Thy hands.
**14** Be not wroth with us, O Lord, beyond measure,
    and remember not our sins in [their appointed] time;
**15** and now look down [upon us],
    for we are all Thy people.
**16** Thy holy city is become a wilderness;
    Zion is become as a wilderness,
    Jerusalem a desolation.
**17** Our holy house, and the glory
    which our fathers blessed,
    is consumed with fire,
**18** and all our glorious things have fallen into ruin.
**19** And upon all these things Thou didst bear with us, O Lord,
    and Thou wast silent,
    and Thou didst humble us exceedingly.

#### Chapter 65

**1** I was made manifest unto them that inquired not of Me;
    I was found by them that sought Me not.
    I said, "Behold, I am here! Behold, I am here!"
    unto a nation which called not upon My Name.
**2** I have stretched forth My hands all the day
    unto a people disobedient and gainsaying;
    who walked not in a true way,
    but after their own sins.
**3** This people, which provoketh Me to anger before My face continually;
    they sacrifice in gardens,
    and burn incense upon bricks to demons,
    which are not [gods].
**4** In tombs and in caves they sleep for the sake of dreams,
    who eat swine's flesh, and the broth of [pagan] sacrifices;
**5** all their vessels are defiled.
    [These are] they that say, "Keep far from me,
    draw not nigh unto me, for I am pure."
