ἀφελῶ τὴν καρδίαν τὴν λιθίνην ἐκ τῆς σαρκὸς ὑμῶν, καὶ δώσω
ὑμῖν καρδίαν σαρκίνην, καὶ τὸ πνεῦμά μου δώσω ἐν ὑμῖν, καὶ 27
ποιήσω ἵνα ἐν τοῖς δικαιώμασί μου πορεύησθε, καὶ τὰ κρίματά
μου φυλάξησθε, καὶ ποιήσητε, καὶ κατοικήσετε ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, ἧς 28
ἔδωκα τοῖς πατράσιν ὑμῶν, καὶ ἔσεσθέ μοι εἰς λαόν, καὶ ἐγὼ
ἔσομαι ὑμῖν εἰς Θεόν. Καὶ σώσω ὑμᾶς ἐκ πασῶν τῶν ἀκαθαρσιῶν 29
ὑμῶν, καὶ καλέσω τὸν σῖτον, καὶ πληθυνῶ αὐτόν, καὶ οὐ δώσω 30
ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς λιμόν· καὶ πληθυνῶ τὸν καρπὸν τοῦ ξύλου, καὶ τὰ γεν-
νήματα τοῦ ἀγροῦ, ὅπως μὴ λάβητε ἔτι ὀνειδισμὸν λιμοῦ ἐν τοῖς
ἔθνεσι. Καὶ μνησθήσεσθε τὰς ὁδοὺς ὑμῶν τὰς πονηράς, καὶ τὰ 31
ἐπιτηδεύματα ὑμῶν τὰ μὴ ἀγαθά, καὶ προσώχθισθε κατὰ πρό-
σωπον αὑτῶν ἐν ταῖς ἀνομίαις ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐν τοῖς βδελύγμασιν
ὑμῶν. Οὐ δι᾿ ὑμᾶς ἐγὼ ποιῶ, λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεός, γνωστὸν 32
ἔσται ὑμῖν· αἰσχύνθητε καὶ ἐντραπῆτε ἐκ τῶν ὁδῶν ὑμῶν, οἶκος
Ἰσραήλ, λέγει Κύριος. Τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεός· ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐ- 33
κείνῃ ᾗ καθαριῶ ὑμᾶς ἐκ πασῶν τῶν ἀνομιῶν ὑμῶν, καὶ κατοικιῶ τὰς
πόλεις, καὶ οἰκοδομηθήσονται αἱ ἔρημοι, καὶ ἡ γῆ ἡ ἠφανισμένη 34
ἐργασθήσεται, ἀνθ᾿ ὧν ὅτι ἠφανισμένη ἐγενήθη κατ᾿ ὀφθαλμοὺς
παντὸς παροδεύοντος, καὶ ἐροῦσιν· ἡ γῆ ἐκείνη ἡ ἠφανισμένη ἐγενήθη 35
ὡς κῆπος τρυφῆς, καὶ αἱ πόλεις αἱ ἔρημοι καὶ ἠφανισμέναι καὶ
κατεσκαμμέναι ὀχυραὶ ἐκάθισαν. Καὶ γνώσονται τὰ ἔθνη, ὅσα ἂν 36
καταλειφθῶσι κύκλῳ ὑμῶν, ὅτι ἐγὼ εἰμι Κύριος, ᾠκοδόμησα τὰς
καθῃρημένας, καὶ κατεφύτευσα τὰς ἠφανισμένας· ἔτι ἐγὼ Κύριος
Κύριος ἐλάλησα, καὶ ποιήσω. Τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεός· ἔτι 37
τοῦτο ζητηθήσομαι τῷ οἴκῳ Ἰσραὴλ τοῦ ποιῆσαι αὐτοῖς· πληθυνῶ 38
αὐτοὺς ὡς πρόβατα ἀνθρώπους, ὡς πρόβατα ἅγια, ὡς πρόβατα
Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐν ταῖς ἑορταῖς αὐτῆς· οὕτως ἔσονται αἱ πόλεις αἱ ἔρη-
μοι πλήρεις προβάτων ἀνθρώπων, καὶ γνώσονται ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι Κύριος.

ΚΕΦ. ΛΖʹ. XXXVII.

ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο ἐπ᾿ ἐμὲ χεὶρ Κυρίου, καὶ ἐξήγαγέ με ἐν πνεύ- 1
ματι Κυρίου, καὶ ἔθηκέ με ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ πεδίου, καὶ τοῦτο ἦν
μεστὸν ὀστέων ἀνθρωπίνων, καὶ περιήγαγέ με ἐπ᾿ αὐτὰ κυκλό- 2
θεν κύκλῳ, καὶ ἰδοὺ πολλὰ σφόδρα ἐπὶ προσώπου τοῦ πεδίου,
καὶ ἰδοὺ ξηρὰ σφόδρα. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς με· υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, εἰ ζή- 3

**Chapter 36**

26 and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh,
and I will give unto you a heart of flesh;
and My Spirit will I put within you, and I will cause you,
27 that in My ordinances ye shall walk,
and My judgments ye shall keep, and perform them;
and ye shall dwell upon the land which
28 I gave unto your fathers;
and ye shall be My people, and I will be your God.
29 And I will save you from all your uncleannesses;
and I will call for the grain, and will multiply it,
and I will not give
30 upon you famine.
And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the produce of the field,
that ye may no more receive the reproach of famine among the
31 nations.
Then shall ye remember your evil ways,
and your practices that were not good;
and ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight
for your iniquities and for your abominations.
32 Not for your sake do I this, saith the Lord God,
be it known unto you:
Be ye ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of
Israel, saith the Lord.
33 Thus saith the Lord God:
In that day when I shall cleanse you from all your iniquities,
I will also cause the cities to be inhabited,
34 and the desolate places shall be built up,
and the land that was laid waste shall be tilled,
whereas it was made desolate before the eyes of
35 every passerby;
and they shall say:
'That land which was laid waste is become as a garden of delight;
and the cities that were desolate, and laid waste, and razed,
are become fortified and inhabited.'
36 And the nations, as many as are left round about you,
shall know that I am the Lord;
I have built the ruined [cities], and planted the laid waste [lands].
I the Lord, even the Lord, have spoken it, and I will perform it.
37 Thus saith the Lord God:
Yet for this will I be entreated by the house of Israel,
to do it for them:
38 I will multiply them as sheep, even men;
as holy sheep, and as the sheep of Jerusalem in her feasts.
Thus shall the desolate cities be full of sheep, even of men;
and they shall know that I am the Lord.

**Chapter 37**

1 Moreover, the hand of the Lord was upon me,
and He brought me forth in the Spirit of the Lord,
and set me down in the midst of the plain;
and this was full of human bones,
2 and He led me round about them, even in a circle;
and behold, there were very many upon the face of the plain,
and behold, they were exceeding dry.
3 And He said unto me:
'Son of man, shall these bones live?'
And I said, 'O Lord God, Thou knowest these things.'
