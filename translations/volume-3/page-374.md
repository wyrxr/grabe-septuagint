Ἰδοὺ ὤμοσα τῷ ὀνόματί μου τῷ μεγάλῳ, λέγει Κύριος, ἐὰν γένηται ἔτι ὄνομά μου καλούμενον ἐν τῷ στόματι παντὸς Ἰούδα
27 εἰπεῖν· Ζῇ Κύριος Κύριος ἐπὶ πάσῃ γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ. Ὅτι ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ
ἐγρήγορα ἐπ᾽ αὐτούς, τοῦ κακῶσαι αὐτούς, καὶ οὐκ ἀγαθῦναι,
καὶ ἐκλείψουσι πᾶς Ἰούδα, οἱ κατοικοῦντες ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ, ἐν
28 ῥομφαίᾳ καὶ ἐν λιμῷ, ἕως ἂν ἐκλείπωσιν. Καὶ οἱ σεσωσμένοι ἀπὸ
ῥομφαίας ἐπιστρέψουσιν ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου εἰς γῆν Ἰούδα ὀλίγοι
ἀριθμῷ, καὶ γνώσονται πάντες οἱ κατάλοιποι Ἰούδα καὶ οἱ καταβαίνοντες ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτου, παροικῆσαι ἐκεῖ, λόγος τίνος ἐμμένει, ὁ ἐμὸς ἢ ὁ αὐτῶν.
29 Καὶ τοῦτο ὑμῖν τὸ σημεῖον, φησὶ Κύριος, ὅτι ἐπισκέψομαι ἐγὼ ἐφ᾽ ὑμᾶς ἐν τῷ τόπῳ τούτῳ εἰς κακά, ἔπως γνῶτε ὅτι στάσει στήσονται οἱ λόγοι μου ἐφ᾽ ὑμᾶς
30 εἰς πονηρά. Οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ δίδωμι τὸν Φαραὼ
Οὐαφρῆ βασιλέα Αἰγύπτου εἰς χεῖρας ἐχθροῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἰς
χεῖρας ζητούντων τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ, καθὰ ἔδωκα τὸν Σεδεκίαν
βασιλέα Ἰούδα εἰς χεῖρας Ναβουχοδονόσορ βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος
1 ἐχθροῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ζητούντων τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ.
**ΚΕΦ. ΝΕ΄.**
Ο ΛΟΓΟΣ ΟΝ ΕΛΑΛΗΣΕΝ ΙΕΡΕΜΙΑΣ ὁ προφήτης πρὸς Βαροὺχ υἱὸν
Νηρίου, ὅτε ἔγραφε τοὺς λόγους τούτους ἐν τῷ βιβλίῳ ἀπὸ στόματος Ἱερεμίου, ἐν τῷ ἐνιαυτῷ τῷ τετάρτῳ τῷ Ἰωακεὶμ υἱῷ
2 Ἰωσία βασιλέως Ἰούδα. Οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ
3 ἐπὶ σοὶ Βαρούχ, ὅτι εἶπας, οἴμοι οἴμοι, ὅτι προσέθηκε (μοι) Κύριος κόπον ἐπίπονόν μοι· ἐκοιμήθην ἐν στεναγμοῖς, ἀνάπαυσιν οὐχ
4 εὗρον. Εἰπὸν αὐτῷ· οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος· ἰδοὺ οὐς ἐγὼ ᾠκοδόμησα,
ἐγὼ καθαιρῶ· καὶ οὓς ἐφύτευσα, ἐγὼ ἐκτίλλω, καὶ σύμπασαν τὴν
5 γῆν ἐκείνην· καὶ σὺ ζητήσεις σεαυτῷ μεγάλα ; μὴ ζητήσῃς, ὅτι
ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐπάγω κακὰ ἐπὶ πᾶσαν σάρκα, λέγει Κύριος· καὶ δώσω
τὴν ψυχήν σου εἰς εὕρημα ἐν παντὶ τόπῳ, οὗ ἐὰν βαδίσῃς ἐκεῖ.

1 ΟΝΤΟΣ ἑνὸς καὶ εἰκοστοῦ ἔτους Σεδεκίου, ἐν τῷ βασιλεύειν
αὐτόν, καὶ ἕνδεκα ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ· καὶ ὄνομα τῇ
2 μητρὶ αὐτοῦ Ἀμιτάαλ, θυγάτηρ Ἱερεμίου, ἐκ Λοβενά. Καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ πονηρὸν ἐνώπιον Κυρίου, ὃν τρόπον ἐποίησεν Ἰωακείμ.
3 ὅτι ἐπὶ τὸν θυμὸν Κυρίου ἐγένετο κατὰ Ἱερουσαλὴμ καὶ Ἰούδα,

**JEREMIAH 44**

**26** "Behold, I have sworn by My great Name, saith the Lord, [that] My Name shall no longer be called upon in the mouth of any of Judah,
**27** to say, 'The Lord, the Lord liveth,' in all the land of Egypt. For behold, I watch over them to bring evil upon them, and not good; and all Judah who dwell in the land of Egypt shall fail,
**28** by sword and by famine, until they be consumed. And those who are saved from the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, few in number. And all the remnant of Judah, and those who go down into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose word shall stand, Mine or theirs.
**29** And this shall be a sign unto you, saith the Lord, that I will visit upon you in this place for evil, that ye may know that My words shall surely stand against you for [your] harm.
**30** Thus saith the Lord: Behold, I will give Pharaoh Hophra, king of Egypt, into the hand of his enemy, and into the hand of them that seek his life; even as I gave Zedekiah, king of Judah, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, his enemy, and of them that sought his life."

**JEREMIAH 45**

**1** THE WORD WHICH JEREMIAH THE PROPHET SPAKE UNTO BARUCH THE SON OF NERIAH, when he wrote these words in a book from the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of
**2** Josiah, king of Judah. Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel,
**3** unto thee, O Baruch: "Because thou hast said, 'Woe is me, woe is me! for the Lord hath added grief to my sorrow; I have lain down in groanings, and have found no rest.'
**4** Say unto him: 'Thus saith the Lord: Behold, that which I have built, I will pull down; and that which I have planted, I will pluck up—even this entire land.
**5** And dost thou seek great things for thyself? Seek them not, for behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the Lord; but I will give thy life as a prize in every place whithersoever thou shalt go.'"

**JEREMIAH 52**

**1** Zedekiah, being one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And the name of his mother was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah, of Libnah.
**2** And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
**3** For through the anger of the Lord it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah,
