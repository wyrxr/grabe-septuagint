ΚΕΦ. ΞΕʹ. Η Σ Α 1209
Θαρὸς εἰμι· οὗτος καπνὸς τοῦ θυμοῦ μου, πῦρ καίεται ἐν αὐτῷ
πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας. Ἰδοὺ γέγραπται ἐνώπιον μου, οὐ σιωπήσο- 6
μαι, ἕως ἂν ἀποδῶ εἰς τὸν κόλπον αὐτῶν τὰς ἁμαρτίας αὐτῶν, 7
καὶ τῶν πατέρων αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό, λέγει Κύριος· οἱ ἐθυμία-
σαν ἐπὶ τῶν ὀρέων, καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν βουνῶν ὠνείδισάν με, ἀποδώσω
τὰ ἔργα αὐτῶν εἰς τὸν κόλπον αὐτῶν. Ὅτι οὕτως λέγει Κύριος· 8
ὃν τρόπον εὑρεθήσεται ὁ φὼς ἐν τῷ βότρυι, καὶ ἐροῦσι, μὴ λυ-
μήνῃ αὐτόν, ὅτι εὐλογία Κυρίου ἐστιν ἐν αὐτῷ, οὕτως ποιήσω
ἕνεκεν τοῦ δουλεύοντός μοι, τούτου ἕνεκεν οὐ μὴ ἀπολέσω πάν-
τας. Καὶ ἐξάξω τὸ ἐξ Ἰακὼβ σπέρμα καὶ τὸ ἐξ Ἰούδα, 9
καὶ κληρονομήσει τὸ ὄρος τὸ ἅγιόν μου, καὶ κληρονομήσου-
σιν οἱ ἐκλεκτοί μου, καὶ οἱ δοῦλοί μου, κατοικήσουσιν ἐ-
κεῖ. Καὶ ἔσονται ἐν τῇ δρυμῷ ἐπαύλεις ποιμνίων, καὶ φά- 10
ραγξ Ἀχὼρ εἰς ἀνάπαυσιν βουκολίων τῷ λαῷ μου, οἳ ἐζήτη-
σάν με. Ὑμεῖς δὲ οἱ ἐγκαταλείποντές με, καὶ ἐπιλανθανόμενοι 11
τὸ ὄρος τὸ ἅγιόν μου, καὶ ἑτοιμάζοντες τῷ δαιμονίῳ τράπεζαν,
καὶ πληροῦντες τῇ τύχῃ κέρασμα, ἐγὼ παραδώσω ὑμᾶς εἰς μά- 12
χαιραν, πάντες ἐν σφαγῇ πεσεῖσθε· ὅτι ἐκάλεσα ὑμᾶς, καὶ οὐχ
ὑπηκούσατε· ἐλάλησα, καὶ παρηκούσατε, καὶ ἐποιήσατε τὸ πο-
νηρὸν ἐναντίον ἐμοῦ, καὶ ἃ οὐκ ἐβουλόμην, ἐξελέξασθε. Διὰ τοῦτο 13
τάδε λέγει Κύριος· ἰδοὺ οἱ δουλεύοντές μοι φάγονται, ὑμεῖς δὲ
πεινάσετε· ἰδοὺ οἱ δουλεύοντές μοι πίονται, ὑμεῖς δὲ διψήσετε·
ἰδοὺ οἱ δουλεύοντές μοι εὐφρανθήσονται, ὑμεῖς δὲ αἰσχυνθήσεσθε.
Ἰδοὺ οἱ δουλεύοντές μοι ἀγαλλιάσονται ἐν εὐφροσύνῃ, ὑμεῖς δὲ 14
κεκράξεσθε διὰ τὸν πόνον τῆς καρδίας ὑμῶν, καὶ ἀπὸ συντριβῆς
πνεύματος ὀλολύξετε. Καταλείψετε γὰρ τὸ ὄνομα ὑμῶν εἰς πλη- 15
σμονὴν τοῖς ἐκλεκτοῖς μου, ὑμᾶς δὲ ἀνελεῖ Κύριος ὁ Θεός. τοῖς
δὲ δουλεύουσιν αὐτῷ κληθήσεται ὄνομα καινόν, ὃ εὐλογηθήσεται 16
ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, εὐλογήσουσι γὰρ τὸν Θεὸν τὸν ἀληθινόν· καὶ οἱ
ὀμνύοντες ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, ὀμοῦνται τὸν Θεὸν τὸν ἀληθινόν· ἐπι-
λήσονται γὰρ τὴν θλίψιν αὐτῶν τὴν πρώτην, καὶ οὐκ ἀναβήσεται
αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τὴν καρδίαν. Ἔσται γὰρ ὁ οὐρανὸς καινός, καὶ ἡ γῆ 17
καινή, καὶ οὐ μὴ μνησθῶσι τῶν προτέρων, οὐδ᾿ οὐ μὴ ἐπέλθῃ
αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τὴν καρδίαν, ἀλλ᾿ εὐφροσύνη καὶ ἀγαλλίαμα εὑρήσου- 18
σιν ἐν αὐτῇ, ὅσα ἐγὼ κτίζω. Ὅτι ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ποιῶ τὴν Ἱερουσα-
λὴμ ἀγαλλίαμα, καὶ τὸν λαόν μου εὐφροσύνην. Καὶ ἀγαλλιά- 19

#### Chapter 65

**5** ...I am bold. This [is] the smoke of My wrath;
    fire burneth therein all the days.
**6** Behold, it is written before Me:
    I will not be silent,
    until I repay into their bosom their sins,
**7** and the sins of their fathers likewise, saith the Lord.
    They who burned incense upon the mountains,
    and upon the hills reviled Me:
    I will repay their works into their bosom.
**8** For thus saith the Lord:
    As the berry is found in the cluster,
    and they say, "Harm it not,
    for a blessing of the Lord is in it;"
    so will I do for the sake of him that serveth Me;
    for this cause I will not destroy all.
**9** And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob
    and out of Judah;
    and it shall inherit My holy mountain;
    and My elect shall inherit [it],
    and My servants, even they shall dwell there.
**10** And in the forest there shall be folds for flocks,
    and the Valley of Achor a resting place for herds
    for My people, who have sought Me.
**11** But ye that forsake Me,
    and forget My holy mountain,
    and prepare a table for the demon,
    and fill a drink-offering for Fortune,
**12** I will deliver you to the sword;
    all of you shall fall by slaughter.
    Because I called you, and ye did not hearken;
    I spoke, and ye disobeyed;
    and ye did evil before Me,
    and ye chose that which I desired not.
**13** Therefore thus saith the Lord:
    Behold, My servants shall eat,
    but ye shall be hungry.
    Behold, My servants shall drink,
    but ye shall thirst.
    Behold, My servants shall rejoice,
    but ye shall be put to shame.
**14** Behold, My servants shall shout for joy in gladness,
    but ye shall cry out because of the pain of your heart,
    and from a broken spirit ye shall wail.
**15** For ye shall leave your name for a byword to My elect;
    but the Lord God shall slay you.
    But to those who serve Him,
    a new name shall be called,
**16** which shall be blessed upon the earth.
    For they shall bless the true God;
    and they that swear upon the earth,
    shall swear by the true God.
    For they shall forget their former tribulation,
    and it shall not ascend upon their heart.
**17** For the heaven shall be new,
    and the earth new;
    and they shall not remember the former things,
    nor shall they ever come upon their heart;
**18** but joy and exultation shall they find therein,
    even all that I create.
**19** For behold, I make Jerusalem an exultation,
    and My people a joy.
    And I will rejoice...
