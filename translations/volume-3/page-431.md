τὰ ἅγιά μου ἀφυλάκτως ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, τοῦ βεβηλοῦν αὐτά·
καὶ ὅτι οὕτως ἐποίουν ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ οἴκου μου, καὶ ὅτι τοῖς ἀνδράσι 40
τοῖς ἐρχομένοις μακρόθεν, οἷς ἀγγέλους ἐξαπεστέλλεσαν πρὸς αὐ-
τοὺς, καὶ ἅμα τῷ ἔρχεσθαι αὐτοὺς, εὐθὺς ἐλούου, καὶ ἐστιβίζου
τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς σου, καὶ ἐκόσμου κόσμῳ, καὶ ἐκάθου ἐπὶ κλίνης 41
ἐστρωμένης, καὶ τράπεζα κεκοσμημένη πρὸ προσώπου αὐτῆς· καὶ
τὸ θυμίαμά μου καὶ τὸ ἔλαιόν μου ἐξευφραίνοντο ἐν αὐτοῖς, καὶ 42
φωνὴν ἁρμονίας ἀνεκρούοντο, καὶ πρὸς ἄνδρας ἐκ πλήθους ἀν-
θρώπων ἔχοντας εἰνωμένους ἐκ τῆς ἐρήμου· καὶ ἐδίδοσαν ψέλλια
ἐπὶ τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν, καὶ στέφανον καυχήσεως ἐπὶ τὰς κεφα-
λὰς αὐτῶν. Καὶ εἶπα, οὐκ ἐν τούτοις μοιχῶνται; ἔργα γυναικὸς 43
πόρνης ἐποίεις, καὶ αὐτὴ ἐξεπόρνευσε; Καὶ εἰσεπορεύοντο πρὸς αὐ- 44
τὴν, ὃν τρόπον εἰσεπορεύοντο πρὸς γυναῖκα πόρνην, οὕτως εἰσε-
πορεύοντο πρὸς Ὀολὰν, καὶ πρὸς Ὀολιβὰν, τοῦ ποιῆσαι ἀνομίαν.
Καὶ ἄνδρες δίκαιοι, αὐτοὶ καὶ ἐκδικήσουσιν αὐτὰς ἐκδικήσει μοι- 45
χαλίδος, καὶ ἐκδικήσει αἵματος, ὅτι μοιχαλίδες εἰσὶ, καὶ αἷμα ἐν
χερσὶν αὐτῶν. Τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναὶ Κύριος· ἀνάγαγε ἐπ᾿ αὐτὰς 46
ὄχλον, καὶ δὸς ἐν αὐταῖς ταραχὴν καὶ διαρπαγὴν, καὶ λιθοβόλη- 47
σον ἐπ᾿ αὐτὰς λίθοις ὄχλων, καὶ κατακέντησον αὐτὰς ἐν τοῖς
ξίφεσιν αὐτῶν· υἱοὺς αὐτῶν καὶ θυγατέρας αὐτῶν ἀποκτενοῦσι
καὶ τοὺς οἴκους αὐτῶν ἐν πυρὶ ἐμπυριοῦσι, καὶ ἀποστρέψω ἀσέ- 48
βειαν ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς, καὶ παιδευθήσονται πᾶσαι αἱ γυναῖκες, καὶ
οὐ μὴ ποιήσουσι κατὰ τὰς ἀσεβείας αὐτῶν. Καὶ δοθήσεται ἡ 49
ἀσέβεια ὑμῶν ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς, καὶ τὰς ἁμαρτίας τῶν ἐνθυμημάτων ὑ-
μῶν λήψεσθε, καὶ γνώσεσθε διότι ἐγὼ Κύριος.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΔʹ. XXIV.

ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς με, ἐν τῷ ἔτει τῷ ἐνάτῳ, ἐν 1
τῷ μηνὶ τῷ δεκάτῳ, δεκάτῃ τοῦ μηνὸς, λέγων· υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, 2
γράψον σεαυτῷ εἰς ἡμέραν ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης, ἀφ᾿ ἧς ἀπη-
ρείσατο βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος ἐπὶ Ἱερουσαλὴμ, ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέρας
τῆς σήμερον. Καὶ εἰπὸν ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον τὸν παραπικραίνοντα πα- 3
ραβολὴν, καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτοὺς· τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναὶ Κύριος· ἔ-
πίστησον τὸν λέβητα, καὶ ἔκχεον εἰς αὐτὸν ὕδωρ, καὶ ἔμβαλε 4
εἰς αὐτὸν τὰ διχοτομήματα, πᾶν διχοτόμημα καλὸν, καὶ σκέλος
(Τόμ. Γʹ.) 28

**39** ...My holy things did they enter without hindrance in that day, so as to profane them;
**40** and that thus they did in the midst of My house; and that to the men coming from afar, to whom they did send messengers, and as soon as they came, thou didst straightway wash [thyself], and didst paint thine eyes with stibium, and didst adorn [thyself] with ornaments,
**41** and didst sit upon a bed made ready, and a table adorned [was set] before her face.
**42** Yea, My incense and Mine oil were made glad in them, and they did strike up the voice of harmony; and unto men from a multitude of people, having united from the desert, did they give armlets upon their hands, and a crown of glory upon their heads.
**43** And I said, "Is it not in these [things] that they commit adultery? Didst thou do the deeds of a harlot woman, and did she herself commit whoredom?"
**44** And they did go in unto her, in such manner as men do go in unto a harlot woman; thus did they go in unto Oholah and unto Oholibah, to commit iniquity.
**45** And righteous men, even they shall execute vengeance upon them with the vengeance of an adulteress, and with the vengeance of blood, for they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.
**46** Thus saith Adonai the Lord: "Bring up a multitude against them, and give into them turmoil and rapine;
**47** and stone them with the stones of multitudes, and pierce them through with their swords. Their sons and their daughters shall they slay, and their houses shall they burn with fire."
**48** And I will turn away impiety from the land, and all women shall be disciplined, and they shall not do according to their impieties.
**49** And your impiety shall be given upon you, and the sins of your thoughts shall ye receive; and ye shall know that I am the Lord.

### Chapter 24

**1** And the word of the Lord came unto me, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, saying:
**2** "Son of man, write for thyself concerning the day, [even] from this day, from which the king of Babylon did set himself against Jerusalem, [even] from this very day.
**3** And speak a parable unto the provoking house, and thou shalt say unto them: Thus saith Adonai the Lord: 'Set the pot [upon the fire], and pour water into it;
**4** and cast into it the cut pieces, every good cut piece, and a leg.'"
