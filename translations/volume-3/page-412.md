6 τῇ σκολιότητι τῆς ψυχῆς σου, ἐν ᾗ ἡμέρᾳ ἐτέχθης. Καὶ διῆλθον
  ἐπὶ σέ, καὶ ἴδον σε πεφυρμένην ἐν τῷ αἵματί σου· καὶ εἶπά σοι· ἐκ
7 τοῦ αἵματός σου ἡ ζωή σου. Καὶ πληθύνου, καθὼς ἡ ἀνατολὴ τοῦ
  ἀγροῦ δέδωκά σε, καὶ ἐπληθύνθης καὶ ἐμεγαλύνθης, καὶ εἰσῆλθες
  εἰς πόλεις πόλεων· οἱ μαστοί σου ἀνωρθώθησαν, καὶ ἡ θρίξ σου ἀνέ-
8 τειλε, καὶ ἦσθα γυμνὴ καὶ ἀσχημονεῦσα. Καὶ διῆλθον διὰ σοῦ
  καὶ ἴδον σε· καὶ ἰδοὺ καιρός σου, ὡς καιρὸς καταλυόντων· καὶ διεπέτασα τὰς πτέρυγάς μου ἐπὶ σέ, καὶ ἐκάλυψα τὴν ἀσχημοσύνην
  σου, καὶ ὤμοσά σοι· καὶ εἰσῆλθον ἐν διαθήκῃ μετὰ σοῦ, λέγει Ἀδωναΐ
9 Κύριος· καὶ ἐγένου μοι, καὶ ἔλουσά σε ἐν ὕδατι, καὶ ἀπέπλυνα
10 τὸ αἷμά σου ἀπὸ σοῦ, καὶ ἔχρισά σε ἐν ἐλαίῳ. Καὶ ἐνέδυσά σε ποι-
   κίλα, καὶ ὑπέδησά σε ὑάκινθον· καὶ ἐζωσά σε βύσσω, καὶ περιέβαλον σε τριχαπτῷ,
11 καὶ ἐκόσμησά σε κόσμῳ, καὶ περιέθηκα ψέλια περὶ τὰς χεῖράς σου, καὶ κάθεμα περὶ τὸν τράχηλόν σου,
12 καὶ ἔδωκα ἐνώτιον ἐπὶ τὸν μυκτήρά σου, καὶ τροχίσκους ἐπὶ τὰ ὦτά σου,
13 καὶ στέφανον καυχήσεως ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλήν σου, καὶ ἐκοσμήθης χρυ-
   σίῳ καὶ ἀργυρίῳ, καὶ τὰ περιβολάιά σου βύσσινα, καὶ τριχαπτὰ
   καὶ ποικίλα, σεμίδαλιν καὶ ἔλαιον καὶ μέλι ἔφαγες, καὶ ἐγένου
14 καλὴ σφόδρα σφόδρα, καὶ κατευθύνθης εἰς βασίλειαν· καὶ ἐξῆλθέ
   σου ὄνομα ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν ἐπὶ τῷ κάλλει σου, διότι συντετελεσμένον
   ἦν ἐν εὐπρεπείᾳ ἐν τῇ ὡραιότητι, ᾗ ἔταξα ἐπὶ σέ, λέγει Ἀδωναΐ
15 Κύριος. Καὶ κατεπεποίθεις ἐν τῷ κάλλει σου, καὶ ἐπόρνευσας ἐπὶ
   τῷ ὀνόματί σου, καὶ ἐξέχεας τὴν πορνείαν σου ἐπὶ πάντα πάροδον,
16 ὃ οὐκ ἔσται· καὶ ἔλαβες ἐκ τῶν ἱματίων σου, καὶ ἐποίησας σεαυτῇ
   εἴδωλα ῥαπτὰ, καὶ ἐξεπόρνευσας ἐπ᾿ αὐτά, καὶ οὐ μὴ εἰσέλθῃς, οὐδ᾿
17 οὐ μὴ γένηται. Καὶ ἔλαβες τὰ σκεύη τῆς καυχήσεώς σου καὶ ἐκ
   τοῦ χρυσίου μου καὶ ἐκ τοῦ ἀργυρίου μου, ἐξ ὧν ἔδωκά σοι, καὶ
18 ἐποίησας σεαυτῇ εἰκόνας ἀρσενικὰς, καὶ ἐξεπόρνευσας ἐν αὐταῖς, καὶ
   ἔλαβες τὸν ἱματισμὸν τὸν ποικίλον σου, καὶ περιέβαλες αὐτὰς, καὶ
   τὸ ἔλαιόν μου καὶ τὸ θυμίαμά μου ἔθηκας πρὸ προσώπου αὐτῶν,
19 καὶ τοὺς ἄρτους μου, οὓς ἔδωκά σοι, σεμίδαλιν καὶ ἔλαιον καὶ μέλι
   ἃ ἐψώμισά σε, καὶ ἔθηκας αὐτὰ πρὸ προσώπου αὐτῶν εἰς ὀσμὴν
20 εὐωδίας· καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ ταῦτα, λέγει Ἀδωναΐ Κύριος, καὶ ἔλα-
   βες τοὺς υἱούς σου καὶ θυγατέρας σου ἃς ἐγέννησας, καὶ ἔθυσας αὐτὰ
21 αὐτοῖς εἰς ἀνάλωσιν· ὡς μικρὰ ἐξεπόρνευσας, καὶ ἔσφαξας τὰ τέκνα

**6** in the perversity of thy soul, in the day wherein thou wast born. And I passed by thee, and saw thee wallowing in thy blood; and I said unto thee, 'Out of thy blood [cometh] thy life.'
**7** And I made thee to multiply, as the growth of the field have I given thee; and thou wast multiplied and thou didst become great, and thou didst enter into cities of cities. Thy breasts were made firm, and thy hair grew, and thou wast naked and unseemly.
**8** And I passed by thee and saw thee; and behold, thy time was as the time of those that come to completion. And I spread My wings over thee, and covered thy shame, and I swore unto thee; and I entered into a covenant with thee, saith Adonai the Lord; and thou becamest Mine.
**9** And I washed thee with water, and I cleansed thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.
**10** And I clothed thee with variegated garments, and I shod thee with hyacinth [leather]; and I girded thee with fine linen, and I covered thee with embroidered work.
**11** And I adorned thee with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a necklace about thy neck.
**12** And I gave a jewel upon thy nose, and earrings upon thy ears,
**13** and a crown of glory upon thy head. And thou wast adorned with gold and with silver, and thy coverings were of fine linen, and embroidered work, and variegated [garments]; fine flour and oil and honey didst thou eat, and thou becamest
**14** exceedingly, exceedingly beautiful, and thou wast prospered into a kingdom. And thy renown went forth among the nations for thy beauty, because it was perfected in comeliness by the splendor which I had bestowed upon thee, saith Adonai the Lord.
**15** But thou didst trust in thy beauty, and didst play the harlot upon thy renown, and thou didst pour out thy fornication upon every thoroughfare,
**16** which should not be. And thou didst take of thy garments, and madest for thyself embroidered images, and didst play the harlot upon them, and thou shalt not enter, nor shall it ever be.
**17** And thou didst take the vessels of thy glory, and of My gold and of My silver, which I had given thee,
**18** and madest for thyself images of males, and didst play the harlot with them; and thou didst take thy variegated apparel, and didst clothe them; and My oil and My frankincense didst thou set before their face,
**19** and My bread, which I had given thee, fine flour and oil and honey, with which I had fed thee, thou didst set them before their face for a sweet savor.
**20** And it came to pass after these things, saith Adonai the Lord, that thou didst take thy sons and thy daughters whom thou hadst begotten, and thou didst sacrifice them
**21** unto them for consumption. Was thy harlotry so small a thing, that thou didst slaughter thy children?
