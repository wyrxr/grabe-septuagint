**ΚΕΦ. ΜΘʹ.**
νήσους ἀρῶ σύσσημόν μου, καὶ ἄξουσι τὰς δὲ θυγατέρας σου ἐπ’ ὤμων ἀρθήσονται.
**23.** τιθηνοί σου, αἱ δὲ ἄρχουσαι αὐτῶν τροφεῖαί σου, γῆς προσκυνήσουσί σοι, καὶ τὸν χοῦν τῶν ποδῶν σου λείξουσιν, καὶ
γνώσῃ, ὅτι ἐγὼ Κύριος, καὶ οὐκ αἰσχυνθήσονται οἱ ὑπομένοντές με.
**24.** Μὴ λήψεται τις παρὰ γίγαντος σκῦλα; καὶ ἐὰν αἰχμαλωτεύσῃ
**25.** τις ἀδίκως, σωθήσεται; Ὅτι οὕτως λέγει Κύριος· ἐάν τις αἰχμαλωτεύσῃ
γίγαντα, λήψεται σκῦλα· λαμβάνων δὲ παρὰ ἰσχύοντος σωθήσεται· ἐγὼ δὲ τὴν κρίσιν σου κρινῶ, καὶ ἐγὼ τοὺς
**26.** υἱούς σου ξύσομαι, καὶ φάγονται οἱ θλίβοντές σε τὰς σάρκας αὐτῶν, καὶ πΐονται ὡς οἶνον νέον τὸ αἷμα αὐτῶν, καὶ μεθυσθήσονται,
καὶ αἰσθανθήσεται πᾶσα σάρξ, ὅτι ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ ῥυσάμενός σε,
καὶ ἀντιλαμβανόμενος ἰσχύος Ἰακώβ.

**ΚΕΦ. Νʹ. L.**

**1.** Οὕτως λέγει Κύριος· ποῖον τὸ βιβλίον τοῦ ἀποστασίου τῆς
μητρὸς ὑμῶν, ᾧ ἐξαπέστειλα αὐτήν; ἢ τίνι ὑπόχρεω πέπρακα
ὑμᾶς αὐτῷ; ἰδοὺ ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις ὑμῶν ἐπράθητε, καὶ ταῖς ἀνομίαις ὑμῶν ἐξαπέστειλα τὴν μητέρα ὑμῶν. Τί ἔτι ἦλθον, καὶ
**2.** οὐκ ἦν ἄνθρωπος, ἐκάλεσα, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ ὑπακούων; μὴ οὐκ ἰσχύει ἡ χεὶρ μου τοῦ ῥύσασθαι, ἢ οὐκ ἰσχύω τοῦ ἐξελέσθαι;
ἰδοὺ τῇ ἀπειλῇ μου ἐξερημώσω τὴν θάλασσαν, καὶ θήσω ποταμοὺς ἐρήμους, καὶ ξηρανθήσονται οἱ ἰχθύες αὐτῶν ἀπὸ τοῦ μὴ
εἶναι ὕδωρ, καὶ ἀποθανοῦνται ἐν δίψει. Καὶ ἐνδύσω τὸν οὐ-
**3.** ρανὸν σκότος, καὶ θήσω ὡς σάκκον τὸ περιβόλαιον αὐτοῦ.
**4.** Κύριος Κύριος δίδωσί μοι γλῶσσαν παιδείας, τοῦ γνῶναι ἐν
καιρῷ ἡνίκα δεῖ εἰπεῖν λόγον· ἔθηκε μοι τὸ πρωΐ, προσέθηκε
μοι ὦτίον ἀκούειν· καὶ ἡ παιδεία Κυρίου Κυρίου ἀνοίγει
τὰ ὦτά μου.
**5.** Ἐγὼ δὲ οὐκ ἀπειθῶ, οὐδὲ ἀντιλέγω.
**6.** Τὸν νῶτόν μου δέδωκα εἰς μάστιγας, τὰς δὲ σιαγόνας μου εἰς ῥαπίσματα, τὸ δὲ πρόσωπόν μου οὐκ ἀπέστρεψα ἀπὸ αἰσχύνης ἐμπτυσμάτων.
**7.** Καὶ Κύριος Κύριος βοηθός μοι ἐγενήθη· διὰ τοῦτο
οὐκ ἐνετράπην, ἀλλὰ ἔθηκα τὸ πρόσωπόν μου ὡς στερεὰν πέτραν,
καὶ ἔγνων, ὅτι οὐ μὴ αἰσχυνθῶ,
**8.** ὅτι ἐγγίζει ὁ δικαιώσας με· τίς
ὁ κρινόμενός μοι; ἀντιστήσω μοι ἅμα· καὶ τίς ὁ κρινόμενός μοι;
ἐγγισάτω μοι·
**9.** Ἰδοὺ Κύριος Κύριος βοηθήσει μοι· τίς κακώσει

#### Chapter 49

**22** Unto the islands will I lift up My ensign;
    and they shall lead [them], and thy daughters shall be borne upon [their] shoulders.
**23** Thy wet-nurses [shall be], and their ruling women thy foster-mothers.
    Upon the earth shall they worship thee, and the dust of thy feet shall they lick;
    and thou shalt know that I am the Lord, and they that await Me shall not be put to shame.
**24** Shall the spoils be taken from a giant?
    Or if any man shall unjustly take captive, shall he be saved?
**25** For thus saith the Lord:
    'Yea, though one take spoils from a giant, and though the captive of the strong be delivered;
    yet will I judge thy cause, and I will flay thy sons.
**26** And they that oppress thee shall eat their own flesh,
    and shall drink their own blood as new wine, and shall be drunken;
    and all flesh shall know that I am the Lord who hath delivered thee,
    and [He that] upholdeth the strength of Jacob.'

#### Chapter 50

**1** Thus saith the Lord:
    'Where is the bill of your mother's divorcement, whom I have sent away?
    Or to which of My creditors have I sold you?
    Behold, for your iniquities were ye sold,
    and for your transgressions have I sent away your mother.
**2** Wherefore, when I came, was there no man?
    When I called, was there none to answer?
    Is My hand not strong enough to deliver?
    Or have I no power to rescue?
    Behold, by My rebuke I will make the sea desolate,
    and I will make the rivers a wilderness;
    and their fish shall be dried up for lack of water,
    and shall die of thirst.
**3** I clothe the heavens with blackness,
    and I make sackcloth their covering.'
**4** The Lord, even the Lord, hath given Me a tongue of instruction,
    that I should know when it is meet to speak a word.
    He hath set [it] for Me in the morning; He hath added unto Me an ear to hear;
    and the instruction of the Lord, even the Lord, openeth My ears.
**5** But I am not rebellious,
    nor do I gainsay.
**6** My back have I given to scourges,
    and My cheeks to blows;
    and My face have I not turned away from the shame of spittings.
**7** For the Lord, even the Lord, was made My helper;
    therefore was I not put to shame.
    But I set My face as a solid rock,
    and I knew that I should not be ashamed;
**8** For He that justifieth Me is near.
    Who is he that contendeth with Me? Let us stand together.
    And who is he that contendeth with Me? Let him draw near to Me.
**9** Behold, the Lord, even the Lord, shall help Me;
    who then shall do Me evil?
