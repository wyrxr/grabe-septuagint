4 τὸ φῶς. Αἰνεῖτε αὐτὸν οἱ οὐρανοὶ τῶν οὐρανῶν καὶ τὸ ὕδωρ τὸ
5 ὑπεράνω τῶν οὐρανῶν. Αἰνεσάτωσαν τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου ὅτι αὐτὸς
6 εἶπε, καὶ ἐγενήθησαν· αὐτὸς ἐνετείλατο, καὶ ἐκτίσθησαν. Ἔστησεν
7 αὐτὰ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, καὶ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τοῦ αἰῶνος· πρόσταγμα
8 ἔθετο, καὶ οὐ παρελεύσεται. Αἰνεῖτε τὸν Κύριον ἐκ τῆς γῆς· δρά-
9 κοντες καὶ πᾶσαι ἄβυσσοι· πῦρ, χάλαζα, χιών, κρύσταλλος, πνεῦ-
10 μα καταιγίδος, τὰ ποιοῦντα τὸν λόγον αὐτοῦ· τὰ ὄρη καὶ πάντες
11 οἱ βουνοί, ξύλα καρποφόρα καὶ πᾶσαι κέδροι· τὰ θηρία καὶ πάντα
12 τὰ κτήνη, ἑρπετὰ καὶ πετεινὰ πτερωτά· βασιλεῖς τῆς γῆς καὶ πάν-
13 τες λαοί, ἄρχοντες καὶ πάντες κριταὶ γῆς· νεανίσκοι καὶ παρ-
14 θένοι, πρεσβῦται μετὰ νεωτέρων. Αἰνεσάτωσαν τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου·
    ὅτι ὑψώθη τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ μόνου, ἡ ἐξομολόγησις αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ γῆς
    καὶ οὐρανοῦ. Καὶ ὑψώσει κέρας λαοῦ αὐτοῦ· ὕμνος πᾶσι τοῖς
    ὁσίοις αὐτοῦ, τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ, λαῷ ἐγγίζοντι αὐτῷ. ᾿Αλληλούϊα.

3 αὐτόν, καὶ υἱοὶ Σιὼν ἀγαλλιάσθωσαν ἐπὶ τῷ βασιλεῖ αὐτῶν· αἰ-
4 νεσάτωσαν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ ἐν χορῷ, ἐν τυμπάνῳ καὶ ψαλτηρίῳ
5 ψαλάτωσαν αὐτῷ. Ὅτι εὐδοκεῖ Κύριος ἐν λαῷ αὐτοῦ· καὶ ὑψώσει
6 πραεῖς ἐν σωτηρίᾳ. Καυχήσονται ὅσιοι ἐν δόξῃ, (καὶ) ἀγαλλιά-
7 σονται ἐπὶ τῶν κοιτῶν αὐτῶν. Αἱ ὑψώσεις τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐν τῷ λά-
8 ρύγγι αὐτῶν, καὶ ῥομφαῖαι δίστομοι ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτῶν· τοῦ

    δῆσαι τοὺς βασιλεῖς αὐτῶν ἐν πέδαις, καὶ τοὺς ἐνδόξους αὐτῶν ἐν
    χειροπέδαις σιδηραῖς· τοῦ ποιῆσαι ἐν αὐτοῖς κρίμα ἔγγραπτον·
    δόξα αὕτη ἐστὶ πᾶσι τοῖς ὁσίοις αὐτοῦ. ᾿Αλληλούϊα.

**PSALM 148 (LXX 148) [continued].**

**4** [And] the light. Praise Him, ye heavens of heavens,
    and ye waters that are above the heavens.
**5** Let them praise the Name of the Lord;
    for He spake, and they were made;
**6** He commanded, and they were created.
    He hath established them for ever,
**7** and for ever and ever;
    He hath given them a decree,
    and it shall not pass away.
**8** Praise the Lord from the earth,
    ye dragons and all ye deeps;
**9** Fire, hail, snow, ice,
    stormy wind, fulfilling His word;
**10** Mountains and all hills,
    fruitful trees and all cedars;
**11** Wild beasts and all cattle,
    creeping things and winged fowl;
**12** Kings of the earth and all peoples,
    princes and all judges of the earth;
**13** Young men and maidens,
    old men with young.
**14** Let them praise the Name of the Lord;
    for His Name alone is exalted;
    His confession [of praise] is upon earth and heaven.
    And He shall exalt the horn of His people,
    a hymn to all His saints,
    to the sons of Israel, a people drawing nigh unto Him.
    Alleluia.

**PSALM 149 (LXX 149).**

*Alleluia.*
**1** Sing unto the Lord a new song;
    His praise is in the assembly of the saints.
**2** Let Israel rejoice in Him Who made him,
    and let the sons of Zion exult in their King.
**3** Let them praise His Name in the dance,
    with timbrel and psaltery
**4** let them sing praises unto Him.
**5** For the Lord taketh pleasure in His people;
    and He shall exalt the meek in salvation.
**6** The saints shall boast in glory,
    and they shall exult upon their beds.
**7** The high praises of God are in their throat,
**8** and two-edged swords are in their hands;
**9** To execute vengeance among the nations,
    and rebukes among the peoples;
    To bind their kings with fetters,
    and their glorious ones with iron manacles;
    To execute upon them the written judgment;
    this is the glory unto all His saints.
    Alleluia.

**PSALM 150 (LXX 150).**

*Alleluia.*
**1** Praise God in His saints;
    praise Him in the firmament of His power.
**2** Praise Him for His mighty acts;
    praise Him according to the multitude of His greatness.
**3** Praise Him with the sound of the trumpet;
    praise Him with
