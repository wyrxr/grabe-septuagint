ΚΕΦ. ΙΗʹ. ΙΘʹ.                Η Σ Α           
5 δρόσου ἡμέρας ἀμητοῦ ἔσται, πρὸ τοῦ θερισμοῦ, ἐὰν συντελεσθῇ ἄνθος, καὶ ὄμφαξ ἀνθήσῃ ἀπὸ ὀμφακίζουσα· καὶ ἀφελεῖ
τὰ βοτρύδια τὰ μικρὰ τοῖς δρεπάνοις, καὶ τὰς κληματίδας ἀφελεῖ, καὶ ἀποκόψει, καὶ καταλείψει ἅμα τοῖς πετεινοῖς τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ τοῖς θηρίοις τῆς γῆς· καὶ συναχθήσεται ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς
τὰ πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ πάντα τὰ θηρία τῆς γῆς ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν ἥξει. Ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ ἀνενεχθήσεται δῶρα Κυρίῳ Σαβαὼθ
ἐκ λαοῦ τεθλιμμένου καὶ τετιλμένου, καὶ ἀπὸ λαοῦ μεγάλου, ἀπὸ
τοῦ νῦν, καὶ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα χρόνον· ἔθνος ἐλπίζον καὶ καταπεπατημένον, ὃ ἐστιν ἐν μέρει τοῦ ποταμοῦ τῆς χώρας αὐτοῦ, εἰς
τὸν τόπον οὗ τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου Σαβαὼθ ὄρος Σιών.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΘʹ. ΧΙΧ.

ΟΡΑΣΙΣ ΑΙΓΥΠΤΟΥ. Ἰδοὺ Κύριος κάθηται ἐπὶ νεφέλης
1 κούφης, καὶ ἥξει εἰς Αἴγυπτον, καὶ σεισθήσεται τὰ χειροποίητα
Αἰγύπτου ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἡ καρδία αὐτῶν ἡττηθήσεται
ἐν αὐτοῖς.
2 Καὶ ἐπεγερθήσονται Αἰγύπτιοι ἐπ᾿ Αἰγυπτίους, καὶ πολεμήσει ἄνθρωπος τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἄνθρωπος τὸν πλησίον
αὐτοῦ, ἐπεγερθήσεται πόλις ἐπὶ πόλιν, καὶ νομὸς ἐπὶ νομόν.
3 Καὶ ταραχθήσεται τὸ πνεῦμα τῶν Αἰγυπτίων ἐν αὐτοῖς, καὶ τὴν βουλὴν αὐτῶν διασκεδάσω, καὶ ἐπερωτήσουσι τοὺς θεοὺς αὐτῶν, καὶ
τὰ ἀγάλματα αὐτῶν, καὶ τοὺς ἐκ τῆς γῆς φωνοῦντας, καὶ τοὺς
ἐγγαστριμύθους, καὶ τοὺς γνώστας.
4 Καὶ παραδώσω τὴν Αἴγυπτον εἰς χεῖρας ἀνθρώπων κυρίων σκληρῶν, καὶ βασιλεῖς σκληροὶ κυριεύσουσιν αὐτῶν· τάδε λέγει ὁ δεσπότης Κύριος Σαβαώθ·
5 καὶ πίονται οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι ὕδωρ τὸ παρὰ θάλασσαν, ὁ δὲ ποταμὸς ἐκλείψει, καὶ ξηρανθήσεται.
6 Καὶ ἐκλείψουσιν οἱ ποταμοί, καὶ αἱ διώρυγες τοῦ ποταμοῦ· καὶ ξηρανθήσεται πᾶσα συναγωγὴ ὕδατος,
7 καὶ ἐν παντὶ ἕλει καλάμου καὶ παπύρου, καὶ τὸ ἄχι τὸ χλωρὸν
κύκλῳ τοῦ ποταμοῦ, καὶ πᾶν τὸ σπειρόμενον διὰ τοῦ
ποταμοῦ ξηρανθήσεται ἀνεμόφθορον.
8 Καὶ στενάξουσιν οἱ ἁλιεῖς, καὶ
στενάξουσι πάντες οἱ βάλλοντες ἄγκιστρον εἰς τὸν ποταμόν, καὶ
οἱ βάλλοντες σαγήνας, καὶ οἱ ἀμφιβολεῖς πενθήσουσι.
9 Καὶ αἰσχύνη
λήψεται τοὺς ἐργαζομένους τὸ λίνον τὸ σχιστόν, καὶ τοὺς ἐργαζομένους τὴν βύσσον,
10 καὶ ἔσονται οἱ διαλογιζόμενοι αὐτὰ ἐν

**Chapter 18**

**5** of dew in the day of harvest shall it be; before the harvest, when the blossom shall be perfected, and the unripe grape doth burgeon from its green estate; and He shall take away
**6** the small clusters with the sickles, and the vine branches He shall remove, and shall cut them off, and leave them together with the birds of heaven, and with the beasts of the earth; and the birds of heaven shall be gathered upon them, and all the beasts of the earth shall come upon him.
**7** In that time shall gifts be brought unto the Lord of Hosts from a people afflicted and plucked bare, and from a great people, from this time forth, and unto everlasting time; a nation that hopeth and is trodden underfoot, which is in the region of the river of its land, unto the place where the name of the Lord of Hosts is Mount Zion.

**Chapter 19**

THE VISION OF EGYPT.
**1** Behold, the Lord doth sit upon a swift cloud, and shall come into Egypt; and the handmade idols of Egypt shall be shaken at His presence; and their heart shall faint within them.
**2** And the Egyptians shall rise up against the Egyptians, and man shall wage war against his brother, and man against his neighbor; city shall rise up against city, and nome against nome.
**3** And the spirit of the Egyptians shall be troubled within them, and their counsel will I scatter; and they shall inquire of their gods, and their idols, and of those who call out of the earth, and of the ventriloquists, and of the wizards.
**4** And I will deliver Egypt into the hand of harsh masters, and cruel kings shall have dominion over them, saith the Lord, the Master, the Lord of Hosts.
**5** And the Egyptians shall drink the water which is by the sea; and the river shall fail, and shall be dried up.
**6** And the rivers shall fail, and the canals of the river; and every reservoir of water shall be dried up,
**7** and in every marsh of reed and papyrus; and the green herbage round about the river, and all that is sown by the river, shall be dried up, blighted by the wind.
**8** And the fishers shall mourn, and all they that cast a hook into the river shall lament, and they that spread nets, and they that cast their casting-nets shall mourn.
**9** And shame shall lay hold upon them that work the carded flax, and upon them that weave the fine linen,
**10** and they that devise these things shall be in [sorrow].
