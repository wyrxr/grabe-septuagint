ἁμαρτημάτων μου, ὅτι πολλοὶ οἱ στεναγμοί μου, καὶ ἡ καρδία μου λυπεῖται.

                                  Ἄλεφ.
Πῶς ἐγνώρισεν ἐν ὀργῇ αὐτοῦ Κύριος τὴν θυγατέρα 1
Σιών, κατέῤῥιψεν ἐξ οὐρανοῦ εἰς γῆν δόξασμα Ἰσραήλ, καὶ οὐκ
ἐμνήσθη ὑποποδίου ποδῶν αὐτοῦ ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ὀργῆς θυμοῦ αὐτοῦ.
<br>
                                  Βήθ.
Κατεπόντισε Κύριος, οὐ φεισάμενος, πάντα τὰ ὡραῖα Ἰακὼβ 2
καθεῖλεν ἐν θυμῷ αὐτοῦ, τὰ ὀχυρώματα τῆς θυγατρὸς Ἰούδα
ἐκόλλησεν εἰς τὴν γῆν, ἐβεβήλωσε εἰς τὴν γῆν βασιλέα αὐτῆς,
καὶ ἄρχοντας αὐτῆς.

                                 Γίμελ.
Συνέκλασεν ἐν ὀργῇ θυμοῦ αὐτοῦ πᾶν κέρας Ἰσραήλ, ἀπέστρε- 3
ψεν εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω δεξιὰν αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ προσώπου ἐχθροῦ, καὶ
ἀνῆψεν ἐν Ἰακὼβ ὡς πῦρ φλόγα, καὶ κατέφαγε πάντα τὰ κύκλῳ.
<br>
                                 Δάλεθ.
Ἐνέτεινε τόξον αὐτοῦ ὡς ἐχθρός, ἐπενάντιος, ἐστερέωσε δεξιὰν 4
αὐτοῦ ὡς ὑπεναντίος, καὶ ἀπέκτεινε πάντα τὰ ἐπιθυμήματα τῶν
ὀφθαλμῶν μου ἐν σκηνῇ θυγατρὸς Σιών, ἐξέχεεν ὡς πῦρ τὸν
θυμὸν αὐτοῦ.
<br>
                                   Ἧ.
Ἐγενήθη Κύριος ὡς ἐχθρός, κατεπόντισεν Ἰσραήλ, κατεπόντισε 5
πάσας τὰς βάσεις αὐτῆς· διέφθειρε τὰ ὀχυρώματα αὐτῆς, καὶ
ἐπλήθυνεν ἐν τῇ θυγατρὶ Ἰούδα ταπεινούμενον καὶ τεταπει-
νωμένην.
<br>
                                  Οὔαῦ.
Καὶ διεπάταξεν ὡς ἄμπελον τὸ σκήνωμα αὐτοῦ, διέφθειρεν ἑορτὴν 6
αὐτοῦ· ἐπελάθετο Κύριος ὃ ἐποίησεν ἐν Σιὼν ἑορτῆς καὶ σαββά-
του, καὶ παρώξυνεν ἐμβριμήματι ὀργῆς αὐτοῦ βασιλέα καὶ ἱερέα
καὶ ἄρχοντα.
<br>
                                  Ζαΐν.
Ἀπώσατο θυσιαστήριον αὐτοῦ Κύριος, ἀπετίναξεν ἁγίασμα αὐτοῦ, 7
συνέτριψεν ἐν χειρὶ ἐχθροῦ τεῖχος βάρεων αὐτῆς. φωνὴν ἔδωκαν
ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου ὡς ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ἑορτῆς.

concerning all my sins; for many are my groanings, and my heart is sorrowful.

### Chapter II.

**Aleph.**
**1** How hath the Lord, in His wrath, brought to nought the daughter of Zion? He hath cast down from heaven to earth the glory of Israel, and He hath not remembered the footstool of His feet in the day of the wrath of His anger.

**Beth.**
**2** The Lord hath swallowed up, without sparing, all the beautiful [places] of Jacob. He hath cast down in His anger the strongholds of the daughter of Judah; He hath made [them] cleave to the ground. He hath profaned unto the ground her king and her princes.

**Gimel.**
**3** He hath broken in pieces, in the wrath of His anger, every horn of Israel. He hath turned back His right hand from the face of the enemy, and He hath kindled in Jacob a flaming fire, and it hath consumed all that is round about.

**Daleth.**
**4** He hath bent His bow as an enemy, [as] an adversary. He hath set firm His right hand as an opponent, and He hath slain all that my eyes desired in the dwelling of the daughter of Zion; He hath poured out His wrath like fire.

**He.**
**5** The Lord is become as an enemy. He hath swallowed up Israel; He hath swallowed up all her foundations. He hath destroyed her strongholds, and He hath multiplied in the daughter of Judah humiliation and desolation.

**Vau.**
**6** And He hath broken down His dwelling like a vine; He hath destroyed His festival. The Lord hath forgotten that which He made in Zion, [even the observance] of feast and sabbath; and He hath provoked, with the indignation of His anger, king and priest and ruler.

**Zain.**
**7** The Lord hath cast off His altar; He hath cast away His sanctuary. He hath broken in pieces by the hand of the enemy the wall of her fortresses. They have uttered a cry in the house of the Lord as in a day of feast.
