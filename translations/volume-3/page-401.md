ΚΕΦ. Θʹ.                                    ΙΕΖΕΚΙΗΛ                                        1339
Καὶ ἑβδομήκοντα ἄνδρες ἐκ τῶν πρεσβυτέρων οἴκου Ἰσραήλ, καὶ      11
Ἰεζονίας δ τοῦ Σαφὰν ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῶν εἱστήκει πρὸ προσώπου αὐ-
τῶν, καὶ ἕκαστος θυμιατήριον αὐτοῦ εἶχεν ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἡ
ἀτμὶς τοῦ θυμιάματος ἀνέβαινε. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς μέ· Υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου,   12
ἑώρακας ἃ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι οἴκου Ἰσραὴλ ποιοῦσιν ὧδε ἕκαστος
αὐτῶν ἐν τῷ κοιτῶνι τῷ κρυπτῷ αὐτῶν· διότι εἶπαν· ἐγκαταλέ-
λειπε Κύριος, οὐκ ἐφορᾷ δ Κύριος τὴν γῆν. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς μέ· Ἔτι     13
ὄψῃ ἀνομίας μείζονας, ἃς οὗτοι ποιοῦσι. Καὶ εἰσήγαγέ με ἐπὶ τὰ    14
πρόθυρα τῆς πύλης οἴκου Κυρίου τῆς βλεπούσης πρὸς βορρᾶν· καὶ
ἰδοὺ ἐκεῖ γυναῖκες καθήμεναι θρηνοῦσαι τὸν Θαμμούζ. Καὶ εἶπε     15
πρὸς μέ· Υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου ἑώρακας, μὴ μικρὰ τὸ οἴκῳ Ἰούδα τοῦ
ποιεῖν τὰς ἀνομίας, ἃς πεποιήκασιν αὐτοὶ ὧδε· καὶ ἔτι ὄψῃ ἐπιτη-
δεύματα μείζονα τούτων. Καὶ εἰσήγαγέ με εἰς τὴν αὐλὴν οἴκου   16
Κυρίου τὴν ἐσωτέραν, καὶ ἰδοὺ, ἐπὶ τῶν προθύρων ναοῦ Κυρίου
ἀναμέσον τῶν αἰλάμ, καὶ ἀναμέσον τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου, ὡς εἴκοσι
καὶ πέντε ἄνδρες τὰ ὀπίσθια αὐτῶν δεδωκότες πρὸς τὸν ναὸν Κυ-
ρίου, καὶ τὰ πρόσωπα αὐτῶν ἀπέναντι, καὶ οὗτοι προσεκύνουν κατ᾽ 17
ἀνατολὰς τῷ ἡλίῳ. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς μέ· Ἑώρακας υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, μὴ
μικρὰ τῷ οἴκῳ Ἰούδα τοῦ ποιεῖν τὰς ἀνομίας ἃς πεποιήκασιν
ὧδε; διότι ἔπλησαν τὴν γῆν ἀνομίας, καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν τοῦ παροργί-
σαί με· καὶ ἰδοὺ αὐτοὶ ἐκτείνουσι τὸ κλῆμα ὡς μυκτηρίζοντες, καὶ  18
ἐγὼ ποιήσω αὐτοῖς μετὰ θυμοῦ· οὐ φείσεται ὁ ὀφθαλμός μου, οὐδὲ
μὴ ἐλεήσω· καὶ καλέσουσιν ἐν τοῖς ὠσί μου, καὶ οὐ μὴ εἰσακούσω
αὐτῶν.

ΚΕΦ. Θʹ. IX.

ΚΑΙ ἀνέκραγεν εἰς τὰ ὦτά μου φωνῇ μεγάλῃ, λέγων· Ἔγγι- 1
κεν ἡ ἐκδίκησις τῆς πόλεως· καὶ ἕκαστος εἶχε τὰ σκεύη τῆς ἐξο-
λεθρεύσεως ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἰδοὺ ἓξ ἄνδρες ἤρχοντο ἀπὸ τῆς 2
ὁδοῦ τῆς πύλης τῆς ὑψηλῆς τῆς βλεπούσης πρὸς βορρᾶν, καὶ ἑκάστου
πέλυξ ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ εἷς ἀνὴρ ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῶν ἐνδεδυκὼς
ποδήρη, καὶ ζώνη σαπφείρου ἐπὶ τῆς ὀσφύος αὐτοῦ· καὶ εἰσῆλθον,
καὶ ἔστησαν ἐχόμενα τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου τοῦ χαλκοῦ. Καὶ δόξα   3
Θεοῦ Ἰσραὴλ ἀνέβη ἐπὶ τῶν Χερουβίμ, ἡ οὖσα ἐπ᾽ αὐτῶν εἰς τὸ
αἴθριον τοῦ οἴκου· καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸν ἄνδρα τὸν ἐνδεδυκότα τὸν πο-
δήρη, ὃς εἶχεν ἐπὶ τῆς ὀσφύος αὐτοῦ τὴν ζώνην, καὶ εἶπε Κύριος 4

### Chapter 8

**11** And seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, and Jeazanias **the** son of Shaphan, stood in the midst of them, before their faces; and each one had his censer in his hand, and the smoke of the incense ascended.
**12** And He said unto me: "Son of man, hast thou seen what the elders of the house of Israel do here, each of them in his secret chamber? For they have said, 'The Lord hath forsaken [us], **the** Lord doth not look upon the earth.'"
**13** And He said unto me: "Thou shalt yet see greater abominations, which these commit."
**14** And He brought me to the entrance of the gate of the house of the Lord which looketh toward the north; and behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz.
**15** And He said unto me: "Son of man, hast thou seen? *Is it not a trifling thing*, the [matter] to the house of Judah, that they commit the abominations which they have wrought here? And yet shalt thou see greater devices than these."
**16** And He brought me into the inner court of the house of the Lord; and behold, at the entrance of the temple of the Lord, between the porticoes and between the altar, were about twenty and five men, with their backs turned toward the temple of the Lord, and their faces eastward; and these worshipped the sun toward the east.
**17** And He said unto me: "Hast thou seen, Son of man? Is it not a light thing to the house of Judah, to commit the abominations which they have wrought here? For they have filled the land with lawlessness, and have returned to provoke Me to wrath; and behold, they stretch forth the branch as those who mock,
**18** and I will deal with them in wrath; My eye shall not spare, neither will I have mercy; and though they cry in My ears, yet will I not hear them."

### Chapter 9

**1** And He cried in mine ears with a great voice, saying: "The avenging of the city hath drawn nigh; and each man had the instruments of destruction in his hand."
**2** And behold, six men came from the way of the high gate which looketh toward the north, and each one had an axe in his hand; and one man among them was clothed in a long garment, and a sapphire girdle was upon his loins; and they came in, and stood beside the bronze altar.
**3** And the glory of the God of Israel went up from upon the Cherubim, where it was upon them, to the threshold of the house; and He called to the man clothed in the long garment, who had the girdle upon his loins,
**4** and the Lord said unto him:
