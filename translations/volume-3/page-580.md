ΖΑΧΑΡΙΑΣ.
ΚΕΦ. ςʹ. VI.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐπέστρεψα, καὶ ἦρα τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς μου, καὶ ἰδοὺ τέσσαρα ἅρματα ἐκπορευόμενα ἐκ μέσου δύο ὀρέων, καὶ τὰ
2 ὄρη ἦν ὄρη χαλκᾶ· ἐν τῷ ἅρματι τῷ πρώτῳ ἵπποι πυῤῥοί, καὶ
3 ἐν τῷ ἅρματι τῷ δευτέρῳ ἵπποι μέλανες, καὶ ἐν τῷ ἅρματι τῷ τρίτῳ ἵπποι λευκοί, καὶ ἐν τῷ ἅρματι τῷ τετάρτῳ ἵπποι ποικίλοι ψαροί.
4 Καὶ ἀπεκρίθην, καὶ εἶπα πρὸς τὸν ἄγγελον τὸν λαλοῦντα ἐν ἐμοί· τί ἐστι ταῦτα, Κύριε;
5 Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη ὁ ἄγγελος ὁ λαλῶν ἐν ἐμοί, καὶ εἶπε· ταῦτά ἐστιν οἱ τέσσαρες ἄνεμοι τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, ἐκπορεύονται παραστῆναι τῷ Κυρίῳ πάσης τῆς γῆς.
6 Ἐν ᾧ ἦσαν οἱ ἵπποι οἱ μέλανες, ἐξεπορεύοντο ἐπὶ γῆν βορρᾶ· καὶ οἱ λευκοὶ ἐξεπορεύοντο κατόπισθεν αὐτῶν· καὶ οἱ ποικίλοι
7 ἐξεπορεύοντο ἐπὶ γῆν νότου· καὶ οἱ ψαροὶ ἐξεπορεύοντο, καὶ ἐπέβλεπον τοῦ πορεύεσθαι καὶ τοῦ περιοδεῦσαι τὴν γῆν. Καὶ εἶπε· πορεύεσθε, καὶ περιοδεύσατε τὴν γῆν· καὶ περιώδευσαν τὴν
8 γῆν. Καὶ ἀνεβόησε, καὶ ἐλάλησε πρὸς μέ, λέγων· ἰδοὺ οἱ ἐκπορευόμενοι ἐπὶ γῆν βορρᾶ ἀνέπαυσαν τὸν θυμόν μου ἐν γῇ βορρᾶ.
9.10 Καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς μέ, λέγων· λάβε τὰ ἐκ τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας παρὰ τῶν ἀρχόντων, καὶ παρὰ τῶν χρησίμων αὐτῆς, καὶ παρὰ τῶν ἐπεγνωκότων αὐτήν, καὶ εἰσελεύσῃ σὺ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ εἰς τὸν οἶκον Ἰωσίου τοῦ Σοφονίου τοῦ ἥκοντος ἐκ
11 Βαβυλῶνος· καὶ λήψῃ ἀργύριον καὶ χρυσίον, καὶ ποιήσεις στεφάνους, καὶ ἐπιθήσεις ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν Ἰησοῦ τοῦ Ἰωσεδὲκ τοῦ ἱερέως τοῦ μεγάλου.
12 Καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτόν· τάδε λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ· ἰδοὺ ἀνήρ, ἀνατολὴ ὄνομα αὐτῷ, καὶ ὑποκάτωθεν αὐτοῦ ἀνατελεῖ, καὶ οἰκοδομήσει τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου·
13 καὶ αὐτὸς λήψεται ἀρετήν, καὶ καθιεῖται, καὶ κατάρξει ἐπὶ τοῦ θρόνου αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔσται ὁ ἱερεὺς ἐκ δεξιῶν αὐτοῦ, καὶ βουλὴ εἰρηνικὴ ἔσται ἀναμέσον ἀμφοτέρων.
14 Ὁ δὲ στέφανος ἔσται τοῖς ὑπομένουσιv αὐτόν, καὶ τοῖς χρησίμοις αὐτῆς, καὶ τοῖς ἐπεγνωκόσιν αὐτήν, καὶ εἰς χάριτα υἱοῦ Σοφονίου, καὶ εἰς ψαλμὸν ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου.
15 Καὶ οἱ μακρὰν ἀπ᾽ αὐτῶν ἥξουσι, καὶ οἰκοδομήσουσιv ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ Κυρίου, καὶ ἐπιγνώσεσθε, διότι Κύριος παντοκράτωρ ἀπέσταλκέ με πρὸς ὑμᾶς· καὶ ἔσται, ἐὰν εἰσακούοντες εἰσακούσητε τῆς φωνῆς Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ὑμῶν.

**Zechariah [Chapter] 6.**

**1** Then I returned, and lifted up mine eyes, and I saw, and behold, four chariots issuing forth from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass.
**2** In the first chariot were reddish horses, and
**3** in the second chariot black horses, and in the third chariot white horses, and in the fourth chariot, horses dappled and dapple-grey.
**4** Then answered I and said unto the angel that spake with me, "What are these, my Lord?"
**5** And the angel that spake with me answered and said, "These are the four winds of heaven, which go forth to stand before the Lord of all the earth."
**6** The [chariot] wherein were the black horses went forth toward the land of the north; and the white [horses] went forth after them; and the dappled [horses]
**7** went forth toward the land of the south; and the dapple-grey [horses] went forth, and they looked forth to go and to patrol the earth. And he said, "Go ye forth, and patrol the earth." So they patrolled the earth.
**8** And he cried aloud, and spake unto me, saying, "Behold, those that go forth toward the land of the north have made My fury rest in the land of the north."
**9** And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
**10** "Take [gifts] from the captives, from their princes, and from her choice ones, and from those who have known her; and thou shalt enter on that same day into the house of Josias, the son of Sophonias, who hath come from Babylon.
**11** And thou shalt take silver and gold, and shalt make crowns, and set them upon the head of Jesus, the son of Josedek, the High Priest.
**12** And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, "Thus saith the Lord Almighty: Behold, a Man whose name is the Branch; and He shall spring forth from beneath Himself, and He shall build the house of the Lord.
**13** Yea, He Himself shall receive glory, and shall sit and rule upon His throne; and the priest shall be on His right hand, and a counsel of peace shall be between both of them.
**14** And the crown shall be for those who wait for Him, and for her choice ones, and for those who have known her; and for the grace of the son of Sophonias, and for a psalm in the house of the Lord.
**15** And those who are far from them shall come and build in the house of the Lord; and ye shall know that the Lord Almighty hath sent me unto you. And it shall come to pass, if ye shall diligently hearken unto the voice of the Lord your God."
