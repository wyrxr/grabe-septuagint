17 βουνοῦ ὑψηλοῦ· ὅτι ἐὰν ὑψώσῃς ὥσπερ ἀετὸς νοσσιάν σου, ἐ-
    κεῖθεν καθελῶ σε, φησὶ Κύριος· καὶ ἔσται ἡ ᾿Ιδουμαία εἰς ἀ-
    βατον, πᾶς ὁ παραπορευόμενος ἐπ᾿ αὐτὴν ἐκστήσεται, καὶ συριεῖ
18 ἐπὶ πᾶσῃ τῇ πληγῇ αὐτῆς. Ὥσπερ κατεστράφη Σόδομα καὶ Γό-
    μοῤῥα, καὶ αἱ πάροικοι αὐτῆς, εἶπε Κύριος παντοκράτωρ, οὐ μὴ
    καθίσει ἐκεῖ ἄνθρωπος, καὶ οὐ μὴ κατοικήσει ἐκεῖ υἱὸς ἀνθρώ-
19 που. ᾿Ιδοὺ, ὥσπερ λέων ἀναβήσεται ἐκ μέσου τοῦ ᾿Ιορδάνου εἰς
    τὸν τόπον ᾿Ηθὰμ, ὅτι ταχὺ ἐκδιώξω αὐτοὺς ἀπ᾿ αὐτῆς, καὶ
    τοὺς νεανίσκους ἐπ᾿ αὐτὴν ἐπιστήσεται· ὅτι τίς ὥσπερ ἐγώ;
    καὶ τίς ἀντιστήσεται μοι; καὶ τίς οὗτος ποιμὴν ὃς στήσεται
20 κατὰ πρόσωπόν μου; Διὰ τοῦτο ἀκούσατε βουλὴν Κυρίου, ἣν
    ἐβουλεύσατο ἐπὶ τὴν ᾿Ιδουμαίαν, καὶ λογισμὸν αὐτοῦ, ὃν ἐλο-
    γίσατο ἐπὶ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας Θαιμὰν, ἐὰν μὴ συμψηφθῶσι τὰ
    ἐλάχιστα τῶν προβάτων, ἐὰν μὴ ἀβατωθῇ ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς κατάλυσις
21 αὐτῶν, ὅτι ἀπὸ φωνῆς πτώσεως αὐτῶν ἐσείσθη ἡ γῆ, καὶ κραυγὴ
22 σου ἐν θαλάσσῃ ἐρυθρᾷ, ἠκούσθη ἡ φωνή σου. ᾿Ιδοὺ, ὥσπερ
    ἀετὸς ὄψεται, καὶ ἐπιπτήσεται, καὶ ἐκτενεῖ τὰς πτέρυγας αὐ-
    τοῦ ἐπ᾿ ὀχυρώματα αὐτῆς· καὶ ἔσται ἡ καρδία τῶν ἰσχυρῶν
    τῆς ᾿Ιδουμαίας ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, ὡς καρδία γυναικὸς ὠδινούσης.

                                        ΚΕΦ. Λ΄. XXX.
                                        (Hebr. Caput XLIX.)

1   Τοῖς υἱοῖς ᾿Αμμὼν οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος· μὴ υἱοὶ οὐκ εἰσὶν ἐν
    ᾿Ισραὴλ, ἢ παραληψόμενος οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν αὐτοῖς; διατὶ παρέλαβε
    Μελχὸλ τὴν Γαλαάδ, καὶ ὁ λαὸς αὐτῶν ἐν πόλεσιν αὐτῶν ἐνοικεῖ;
2   Διὰ τοῦτο ἰδοὺ ἡμέραι ἔρχονται, φησὶ Κύριος, καὶ ἀκου-
    τιῶ ἐπὶ ῾Ραββὰθ υἱῶν ᾿Αμμὼν θόρυβον πολέμου, καὶ ἔσονται
    εἰς ἄβατον καὶ εἰς ἀπώλειαν, καὶ οἱ βωμοὶ αὐτῆς ἐν πυρὶ κα-
    τακαυθήσονται, καὶ παραλήψεται ᾿Ισραὴλ τὴν ἀρχὴν αὐτοῦ, φη-
3   σὶ Κύριος. ᾿Αλάλαξον ᾿Εσεβὼν, ὅτι ὤλετο Γαΐ· κεκράξατε θυ-
    γατέρες ῾Ραββὰθ, περιζώσασθε σάκκους, καὶ ἐπιληπτεύεσθε, καὶ
    κόψασθε (ἐπὶ Μελχὸμ,) καὶ διαδράμετε διὰ τῶν τριχῶν, ὅτι
    Μελχὸμ ἐν ἀποικίᾳ βαδιεῖται, οἱ ἱερεῖς αὐτοῦ καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες
4   αὐτοῦ ἅμα. Τί ἀγαλλιάσῃ ἐν τοῖς πεδίοις ᾿Ενακείμ; διέρρευσ-
    σε τὰ πεδία σου, θυγάτηρ ᾿Ιταμίας, ἡ πεποιθυῖα ἐπὶ τοῖς θη-

**Jeremiah, Chapter 29**
(Continuation of Hebrew Chapter 49)

**17** ...[of] a high mountain; for though thou lift up thy nest as the eagle, thence will I bring thee down, saith the Lord. And Edom shall be made desolate, and every one that passeth by her shall be astonished, and shall hiss
**18** at all her calamity. As Sodom and Gomorrah were overthrown, and the cities round about her, saith the Lord Almighty, no man shall abide there, neither shall the son of man dwell therein.
**19** Behold, as a lion shall come up from the swelling of Jordan unto the dwelling-place of Etham; for I will suddenly drive them out from her, and I will appoint the young men over her. For who is like unto Me? And who will resist Me? And what shepherd is this that shall stand before My face?
**20** Therefore hear ye the counsel of the Lord, which He hath taken against Edom; and His purpose, which He hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: verily, even the least of the flock shall be reckoned [among the destroyed]; verily, their dwelling shall be laid waste upon them.
**21** For at the voice of their downfall, the earth did quake, and thy cry in the Red Sea, thy voice was heard.
**22** Behold, as an eagle he shall look, and shall fly, and shall spread forth his wings over her strongholds; and the heart of the mighty men of Edom in that day shall be as the heart of a woman in travail.

**Jeremiah, Chapter 30**
(Hebrew Chapter 49)

**1** Concerning the sons of Ammon, thus saith the Lord: Hath Israel no sons? Or is there no heir among them? Why hath Melchom taken Gilead, and his people dwell in their cities?
**2** Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will cause a din of war to be heard upon Rabbath of the sons of Ammon; and it shall be for a desolation and for destruction, and her altars shall be utterly consumed by fire; and Israel shall receive his dominion, saith the Lord.
**3** Cry aloud, O Heshbon, for Gai is destroyed! Cry out, ye daughters of Rabbath, gird yourselves with sackcloth, and be seized [with lamentation], and beat yourselves (for Melchom), and run about with torn hair; for Melchom shall go into exile, his priests and his princes together.
**4** Why dost thou glory in the valleys of Enakim? Thy valleys have flowed away, O daughter of Insolence, who trusteth in thy trea-[sures]...
