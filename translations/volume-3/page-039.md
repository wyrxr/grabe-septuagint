Εἰς τὸ τέλος, ἐν ὕμνοις συνέσεως τῷ Δαυίδ. ᾿Ενώτισαι, ὁ 1.2
Θεὸς, τὴν προσευχήν μου, καὶ μὴ ὑπερίδῃς τὴν δέησίν μου· πρόσχες 3
μοι, καὶ εἰσάκουσόν μου· ἐλυπήθην ἐν τῇ ἀδολεσχίᾳ μου, καὶ ἐτα-
ράχθην ἀπὸ φωνῆς ἐχθροῦ, καὶ ἀπὸ θλίψεως ἁμαρτωλοῦ· ὅτι ἐξ- 4
έκλιναν ἐπ᾿ ἐμὲ ἀνομίαν, καὶ ἐν ὀργῇ ἐνεκότουν μοι. Ἡ καρδία 5
μου ἐταράχθη ἐν ἐμοί, καὶ δειλία θανάτου ἐπέπεσεν ἐπ᾿ ἐμέ· φό- 6
βος καὶ τρόμος ἦλθεν ἐπ᾿ ἐμέ, καὶ ἐκάλυψέ με σκότος. Καὶ εἶπα· 7
τίς δώσει μοι πτέρυγας ὡσεὶ περιστερᾶς, καὶ πετασθήσομαι, καὶ
καταπαύσω; ᾿Ιδοὺ ἐμάκρυνα φευγαδεύων, καὶ ηὐλίσθην ἐν τῇ ἐρή- 8
μῳ. Διάψαλμα. Προσεδεχόμην τὸν σῴζοντά με ἀπὸ ὀλιγοψυχίας 9
καὶ καταιγίδος. Καταπόντισον, Κύριε (καὶ) καταδίελε τὰς γλώσ- 10
σας αὐτῶν· ὅτι εἶδον ἀνομίαν καὶ ἀντιλογίαν ἐν τῇ πόλει. Ἡμέ- 11
ρας καὶ νυκτὸς κυκλώσει αὐτὴν ἐπὶ τὰ τείχη αὐτῆς· καὶ ἀνομία
καὶ πόνος ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῆς, καὶ ἀδικία· καὶ οὐκ ἐξέλιπεν ἐκ τῶν 12
πλατειῶν αὐτῆς τόκος καὶ δόλος. Ὅτι εἰ ἐχθρὸς ὠνείδισέ με, 13
ὑπήνεγκα ἄν· καὶ εἰ ὁ μισῶν με ἐπ᾿ ἐμὲ ἐμεγαλοῤῥημόνησεν· ἐκρύ- 14
βην ἂν ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ. Σὺ δὲ ἄνθρωπε ἰσόψυχε, ἡγεμών μου καὶ γνωστέ 15
μου, ὃς ἐπιτοαυτὸ ἐγλύκανες ἐδέσματα· ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ Θεοῦ
ἐπορεύθημεν ἐν ὁμονοίᾳ. ᾿Ελθέτω θάνατος ἐπ᾿ αὐτούς, καὶ κατα- 16
βήτωσαν εἰς ᾅδου ζῶντες· ὅτι πονηρία ἐν ταῖς παροικίαις αὐτῶν,
ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῶν. ᾿Εγὼ πρὸς τὸν Θεὸν ἐκέκραξα, καὶ ὁ Κύριος εἰσ- 17
ήκουσέ μου. Ἑσπέρας καὶ πρωΐ καὶ μεσημβρίας διηγήσομαι, καὶ 18
ἀπαγγελῶ, καὶ εἰσακούσεται τῆς φωνῆς μου. Λυτρώσεται ἐν εἰ- 19
ρήνῃ τὴν ψυχήν μου ἀπὸ τῶν ἐγγιζόντων μοι· ὅτι ἐν πολλοῖς
ἦσαν σὺν ἐμοί. Εἰσακούσεται ὁ Θεός, καὶ ταπεινώσει αὐτοὺς ὁ 20
ὑπάρχων πρὸ τῶν αἰώνων. Διάψαλμα. Οὐ γὰρ ἐστιν αὐτοῖς ἀν-
τάλλαγμα, καὶ οὐκ ἐφοβήθησαν τὸν Θεόν. ᾿Εξέτεινε τὴν χεῖρα 21
αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ ἀποδιδόναι· ἐβεβήλωσαν τὴν διαθήκην αὐτοῦ. Διεμε- 22
ρίσθησαν ἀπὸ ὀργῆς τοῦ προσώπου αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἤγγισεν ἡ καρδία
αὐτοῦ· ἡπαλύνθησαν οἱ λόγοι αὐτοῦ ὑπὲρ ἔλαιον, καὶ αὐτοὶ εἰσι
βολίδες. ᾿Επιῤῥιψον ἐπὶ Κύριον τὴν μέριμνάν σου, καὶ αὐτός σε 23
διαθρέψει· οὐ δώσει εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα σάλον τῷ δικαίῳ. Σὺ δὲ ὁ Θεὸς 24
καταάξεις αὐτοὺς εἰς φρέαρ διαφθορᾶς· ἄνδρες αἱμάτων καὶ δολιό-

**PSALM LIV.**

Unto the End, with Hymns of Understanding; A Psalm of David.

1 Give ear, O God, unto my prayer;
and despise not my supplication.
2 Attend unto me, and hear me:
I am grieved in my lamentation,
and was troubled by the voice of the enemy,
and by the oppression of the sinner.
3 For they have bent [their] iniquity upon me,
and in wrath have they been hostile unto me.
4 My heart is troubled within me,
and the terror of death hath fallen upon me.
5 Fear and trembling came upon me,
and darkness covered me.
6 And I said, "O that I had wings like a dove!
Then would I fly away, and be at rest."
7 Lo, I have fled far away as a fugitive,
and lodged in the wilderness. Selah.
8 I waited for Him that would save me
from faintness of spirit and from the tempest.
9 Engulf them, O Lord, and divide their tongues:
for I have seen iniquity and strife in the city.
10 Day and night shall it encompass her upon her walls:
and iniquity and toil are in the midst of her,
and injustice;
11 And from her streets have not ceased usury and deceit.
12 For if an enemy had reproached me,
I would have borne it;
13 And if he that hateth me had boasted against me,
then would I have hid myself from him.
14 But thou, O man, my soul's companion,
my guide, and my familiar friend,
15 Who together didst make sweet our meals,
[and] we walked in the house of God in unity.
16 Let death come upon them,
and let them go down alive into Hades;
for wickedness is in their dwellings,
in their midst.
17 As for me, I cried unto God;
and the Lord heard me.
18 Evening, and morning, and at noonday
will I narrate [my plight] and declare [it],
and He shall hear my voice.
19 He shall redeem my soul in peace
from those that draw near to me;
for many were they with me.
20 God shall hear, and humble them,
even He that existeth before the ages. Selah.
21 For there is no change for them,
and they feared not God.
22 He stretched forth his hand in the act of rendering recompense;
they have profaned His covenant.
They were scattered by the wrath of His countenance,
and his heart drew near;
his words were smoother than oil,
yet they themselves are darts.
23 Cast thy care upon the Lord,
and He Himself shall nourish thee:
He shall not suffer the righteous to be moved forever.
24 But Thou, O God, shalt bring them down
into the pit of corruption:
men of blood and deceit
shall not live out half their days.
