10 ἐν ἡμέρᾳ πολέμου· οὐκ ἐφύλαξαν τὴν διαθήκην τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ
11 ἐν τῷ νόμῳ αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἤθελον πορεύεσθαι. Καὶ ἐπελάθοντο τῶν
   εὐεργεσιῶν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τῶν θαυμασίων αὐτοῦ, ὧν ἔδειξεν αὐτοῖς·
12 ἐναντίον τῶν πατέρων αὐτῶν (ᾧ) ἐποίησε θαυμάσια, ἐν γῇ Αἰγύ-
13 πτῳ ἐν πεδίῳ Τάνεως. Διέρρηξε θάλασσαν, καὶ διήγαγεν αὐτοὺς·
14 ἔστησεν ὕδατα ὡσεὶ ἀσκόν. Καὶ ὡδήγησεν αὐτοὺς ἐν νεφέλῃ ἡμέ-
15 ρας, καὶ ὅλην τὴν νύκτα ἐν φωτισμῷ πυρός. Διέρρηξε πέτραν ἐν
16 ἐρήμῳ, καὶ ἐπότισεν αὐτοὺς ὡς ἐν ἀβύσσῳ πολλῇ· καὶ ἐξήγαγεν
17 ὕδωρ ἐκ πέτρας, καὶ κατήγαγεν ὡς ποταμοὺς ὕδατα. Καὶ προσ-
   έθεντο ἔτι τοῦ ἁμαρτάνειν αὐτῷ, παρεπίκραναν τὸν ὕψιστον ἐν
18 ἀνύδρῳ· καὶ ἐξεπείρασαν τὸν Θεὸν ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις αὐτῶν, τοῦ
19 αἰτῆσαι βρώματα ταῖς ψυχαῖς αὐτῶν. Καὶ κατελάλησαν τοῦ
   Θεοῦ, καὶ εἶπαν· μὴ δυνήσεται ὁ Θεὸς ἑτοιμάσαι τράπεζαν ἐν ἐρή-
20 μῳ; ᾽Επεὶ ἐπάταξε πέτραν, καὶ ἐῤῥύησαν ὕδατα, καὶ χείμαῤῥοι
   κατεκλύσθησαν· μὴ καὶ ἄρτον δυνήσεται δοῦναι; ἢ ἑτοιμάσαι τρά-
21 πεζαν τῷ λαῷ αὐτοῦ; Διὰ τοῦτο ἤκουσε Κύριος καὶ ἀνεβάλετο,
22 καὶ πῦρ ἀνήφθη ἐν ᾽Ιακώβ, καὶ ὀργὴ ἀνέβη ἐπὶ τὸν ᾽Ισραήλ· ὅτι
   οὐκ ἐπίστευσαν ἐν τῷ Θεῷ, οὐδὲ ἤλπισαν ἐπὶ τὸ σωτήριον αὐτοῦ.
23 Καὶ ἐνετείλατο νεφέλαις ὑπεράνωθεν, καὶ θύρας οὐρανοῦ ἀνέωξε·
24 καὶ ἔβρεξεν αὐτοῖς μάννα φαγεῖν, καὶ ἄρτον οὐρανοῦ ἔδωκεν αὐ-
25 τοῖς· ἄρτον ἀγγέλων ἔφαγεν ἄνθρωπος· ἐπισιτισμὸν ἀπέστειλεν
26 αὐτοῖς εἰς πλησμονήν. ᾽Απῆρε Νότον ἐξ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ ἐπήγαγεν ἐν
27 τῇ δυναστείᾳ αὐτοῦ Λίβα· καὶ ἔβρεξεν ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς ὡσεὶ χοῦν σάρ-
28 κας, καὶ ὡσεὶ ἄμμον θαλάσσης πετεινὰ πτερωτά· καὶ ἐπέπεσον
   εἰς μέσον τῆς παρεμβολῆς αὐτῶν, κύκλῳ τῶν σκηνωμάτων αὐ-
29 τῶν. Καὶ ἐφάγοσαν καὶ ἐνεπλήσθησαν σφόδρα, καὶ τὴν ἐπιθυμίαν
30 αὐτῶν ἤνεγκαν αὐτοῖς· οὐκ ἐστερήθησαν ἀπὸ τῆς ἐπιθυμίας αὐ-
31 τῶν. ᾽Ετι τῆς βρώσεως αὐτῶν οὔσης ἐν τῷ στόματι αὐτῶν, καὶ
   ὀργὴ τοῦ Θεοῦ ἀνέβη ἐπ᾽ αὐτούς, καὶ ἀπέκτεινεν ἐν τοῖς πίοσιν αὐ-
32 τῶν, καὶ τοὺς ἐκλεκτοὺς τοῦ ᾽Ισραὴλ συνεπόδισεν. ᾽Εν πᾶσι τού-
   τοις ἥμαρτον ἔτι, καὶ οὐκ ἐπίστευσαν ἐν τοῖς θαυμασίοις αὐτοῦ·
33 καὶ ἐξέλιπον ἐν ματαιότητι αἱ ἡμέραι αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰ ἔτη αὐτῶν
34 μετὰ σπουδῆς. ῞Οταν ἀπέκτεινεν αὐτοὺς ἐζήτουν αὐτὸν καὶ ἐπέ-
35 στρεφον, καὶ ὤρθριζον πρὸς τὸν Θεόν· καὶ ἐμνήσθησαν, ὅτι ὁ Θεὸς
   βοηθὸς αὐτῶν ἐστι, καὶ ὁ Θεὸς ὁ ὕψιστος λυτρωτὴς αὐτῶν ἐστι.
36 Καὶ ἠπάτησαν αὐτὸν ἐν τῷ στόματι αὐτῶν, καὶ τῇ γλώσσῃ αὐ-

**PSALM LXXVII.**

10 In the day of battle did they turn back;
They kept not the covenant of God,
11 Neither would they walk in His law.
And they forgat His benefits,
And His wondrous deeds which He had shewed them;
12 Before their fathers, (where) He had wrought wonders,
In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
13 He clave the sea, and led them through;
And made the waters to stand as a wineskin.
14 And He led them in a cloud by day,
And all the night in a light of fire.
15 He clave the rock in the wilderness,
And gave them drink as out of a great deep;
16 And He brought forth water out of the rock,
And caused waters to run down as rivers.
17 Yet they added still to sin against Him,
They embittered the Most High in the waterless land;
18 And they tempted God in their hearts,
By asking meat for their souls.
19 And they spake against God, and said,
"Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?
20 Behold, He smote the rock,
And waters gushed forth, and torrents overflowed;
Can He give bread also?
Or prepare a table for His people?"
21 Therefore the Lord heard, and was incensed:
And fire was kindled in Jacob,
22 And wrath ascended upon Israel;
Because they believed not in God,
Neither trusted in His salvation.
23 And He commanded the clouds from above,
And opened the doors of heaven;
24 And rained down manna upon them to eat,
And gave them bread of heaven.
25 Man did eat the bread of angels;
He sent them provision unto satiety.
26 He removed the South wind from heaven,
And brought in by His power the Southwest wind.
27 And He rained down upon them flesh as dust,
And feathered fowls as the sand of the sea;
28 And they fell into the midst of their camp,
Round about their tabernacles.
29 And they ate and were filled exceedingly,
And He brought them their desire.
30 He brought them their desire;
They were not deprived of their desire.
31 While their food was yet in their mouths,
The wrath of God ascended upon them,
And slew among their fattest,
32 And overthrew the chosen men of Israel.
In all these things they sinned still,
And believed not in His wondrous deeds;
33 And their days failed in vanity,
And their years in haste.
34 When He slew them, then they sought Him;
And they returned and rose early unto God.
35 And they remembered that God is their Helper,
And God the Most High is their Redeemer.
36 Yet they deceived Him with their mouth,
And with their tongue they lied unto Him.
