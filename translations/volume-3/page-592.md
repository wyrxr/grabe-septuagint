ΜΑΛΑΧΙΑΣ ΚΕΦ. Αʹ. Βʹ.
γει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ, θυσίαν οὐ προσδέξομαι ἐκ τῶν χει-
11 ρῶν ὑμῶν. Διότι ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν ἡλίου καὶ ἕως δυσμῶν τὸ ὄνο-
μά μου δεδόξασται ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι, καὶ ἐν παντὶ τόπῳ θυμία-
μα προσάγεται ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί μου, καὶ θυσία καθαρά· διότι μέγα
12 τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι, λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ. Ὑμεῖς
δὲ βεβηλοῦτε αὐτὸ ἐν τῷ λέγειν ὑμᾶς· τράπεζα Κυρίου ἠλισγη-
μένη ἐστὶ, καὶ τὰ ἐπιτιθέμενα ἐξουδενῶνται βρώματα αὐτοῦ.
13 Καὶ εἴπατε· ταῦτα ἐκ κακοπαθείας ἐστὶ, καὶ ἐξεφυσήσατε αὐ-
τά, λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ· καὶ εἰσεφέρετε τὰ ἁρπάγματα,
καὶ τὰ χωλὰ, καὶ τὰ ἐνοχλούμενα· καὶ ἐὰν φέρητε τὴν θυσίαν,
εἰ προσδέξομαι αὐτὰ ἐκ τῶν χειρῶν ὑμῶν, λέγει Κύριος παντο-
14 κράτωρ. Καὶ ἐπικατάρατος, ὃς ἦν δυνατὸς, καὶ ὑπῆρχεν αὐτῷ
ἐν τῷ ποιμνίῳ αὐτοῦ ἄρσεν, καὶ εὐχὴ αὐτοῦ ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ, καὶ θύει
διεφθαρμένον τῷ Κυρίῳ· διότι μέγας βασιλεὺς ἐγώ εἰμι, λέγει
Κύριος παντοκράτωρ, καὶ τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐπιφανὲς ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι.

ΚΕΦ. Βʹ. ΙΙ.

1 ΚΑὶ νῦν ἡ ἐντολὴ αὕτη πρὸς ὑμᾶς, οἱ ἱερεῖς· ἐὰν μὴ ὑπα-
2 κούσητε, καὶ ἐὰν μὴ θῆσθε εἰς τὴν καρδίαν ὑμῶν, τοῦ δοῦναι
δόξαν τῷ ὀνόματί μου, λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ, καὶ ἐξαπο-
στελῶ ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς τὴν κατάραν, καὶ ἐπικαταράσομαι τὴν εὐλογίαν
ὑμῶν, καὶ καταράσομαι αὐτήν· καὶ διασκεδάσω τὴν εὐλογίαν ὑμῶν,
καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ἐν ὑμῖν, ὅτι ὑμεῖς οὐ τίθεσθε εἰς τὴν καρδίαν ὑμῶν.
3 Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἀφορίζω ὑμῖν τὸν ὦμον, καὶ σκορπιῶ ἔνυστρον ἐπὶ τὰ
πρόσωπα ὑμῶν, ἔνυστρον ἑορτῶν ὑμῶν, καὶ λήψομαι ὑμᾶς εἰς τὸ
4 αὐτό· καὶ ἐπιγνώσεσθε, διότι ἐγὼ Κύριος ἐξαπέσταλκα πρὸς
ὑμᾶς τὴν ἐντολὴν ταύτην, τοῦ εἶναι τὴν διαθήκην μου πρὸς τοὺς
5 Λευίτας, λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ. Ἡ διαθήκη μου ἦν μετ᾿ αὐ-
τοῦ τῆς ζωῆς καὶ τῆς εἰρήνης, καὶ ἔδωκα αὐτῷ ἐν φόβῳ φο-
βεῖσθαί με, καὶ ἀπὸ προσώπου τοῦ ὀνόματός μου στέλλεσθαι αὐ-
6 τόν· νόμος ἀληθείας ἦν ἐν τῷ στόματι αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀδικία οὐχ
εὑρέθη ἐν χείλεσιν αὐτοῦ· ἐν εἰρήνῃ κατευθύνων ἐπορεύθη μετ᾿
7 ἐμοῦ, καὶ πολλοὺς ἐπέστρεψεν ἀπὸ ἀδικίας. Ὅτι χείλη ἱερέως
φυλάξεται γνῶσιν, καὶ νόμον ἐκζητήσουσιν ἐκ στόματος αὐτοῦ·
8 διότι ἄγγελος Κυρίου παντοκράτορος ἐστίν. Ὑμεῖς δὲ ἐξεκλίνατε

**Malachi [Chapter] 1**

**10** ...[saith] the LORD Almighty, I will not accept an offering from your hands.
**11** For from the rising of the sun, even unto its setting, My Name hath been glorified among the nations; and in every place incense is offered unto My Name, and a pure sacrifice: for great is My Name among the nations, saith the LORD Almighty.
**12** But ye profane it, in that ye say, “The table of the LORD is defiled; and its food, which is set thereupon, is despised.”
**13** And ye say, “Behold, what a weariness is this!” And ye disdain them, saith the LORD Almighty; and ye bring the plundered, and the lame, and the vexed; and if ye offer such as a sacrifice, shall I accept it from your hands? saith the LORD Almighty.
**14** Yea, cursed is he that is mighty, and has in his flock a male [animal], and his vow is upon it, yet sacrifices unto the LORD that which is corrupted; for I am a great King, saith the LORD Almighty, and My Name is manifest among the nations.

**Malachi [Chapter] 2**

**1** And now, O ye priests, this commandment is unto you:
**2** If ye will not hearken, and if ye will not lay [it] to your heart, to give glory unto My Name, saith the LORD Almighty; then will I send the curse upon you, and I will curse your blessing, yea, and I will curse it: and I will scatter your blessing, and it shall not be among you, because ye lay it not to your heart.
**3** Behold, I will sever unto you the shoulder, and I will scatter dung upon your faces, even the dung of your feasts; and I will take you away with it.
**4** And ye shall know that I, the LORD, have sent this commandment unto you, that My covenant might be with the Levites, saith the LORD Almighty.
**5** My covenant was with him [for] life and for peace; and I gave him fear, that he might fear Me, and that he should hold himself in awe before My Name.
**6** The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found upon his lips; in peace and uprightness he walked with Me, and many did he turn back from iniquity.
**7** For the lips of a priest should preserve knowledge, and they should seek the law from his mouth; for he is the messenger of the LORD Almighty.
**8** But ye have turned aside
