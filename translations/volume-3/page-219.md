ΚΕΦ. ΚΖ΄. ΚΗ΄. Η Σ Α Ι Α Σ. 1157
ἠθέτηκα αὐτήν· τοίνυν διὰ τοῦτο ἐποίησε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς πάν-
τα ὅσα συνέταξε· κατακέκαυμαι, βοήσονται οἱ ἐνοικοῦντες ἐν 5
αὐτῇ, ποιήσωμεν εἰρήνην αὐτῷ, ποιήσωμεν εἰρήνην οἱ ἐρχόμενοι
τέκνα Ἰακώβ· βλαστήσει καὶ ἐξανθήσει Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐμπλη- 6
σθήσεται ἡ οἰκουμένη τοῦ καρποῦ αὐτοῦ. Μὴ ὡς αὐτὸς ἐπάτα- 7
ξε, καὶ αὐτὸς οὕτως πληγήσεται; καὶ ὡς αὐτὸς ἀνεῖλεν, οὕ-
τως ἀναιρεθήσεται; Μαχόμενος καὶ ὀνειδίζων ἐξαποστελεῖ αὐτούς· 8
οὐ σὺ ἦσθα ὁ μελετῶν τῷ πνεύματι τῷ σκληρῷ, ἀνελεῖν αὐτοὺς
πνεύματι θυμοῦ; Διὰ τοῦτο ἀφαιρεθήσεται ἡ ἀνομία Ἰακώβ, 9
καὶ τοῦτό ἐστιν ἡ εὐλογία αὐτοῦ, ὅταν ἀφέλωμαι αὐτοῦ τὴν ἀ-
μαρτίαν, ὅταν θῶσι πάντας τοὺς λίθους τῶν βωμῶν κατακε-
κομμένους, ὡς κονίαν λεπτὴν· καὶ οὐ μὴ μείνῃ τὰ δένδρα αὐτῶν,
καὶ τὰ εἴδωλα αὐτῶν ἐκκεκομμένα, ὥσπερ δρυμὸς μακράν. Τὸ 10
κατοικούμενον ποίμνιον ἀνειμένον ἔσται, ὡς ποίμνιον καταλελειμ-
μένον· καὶ ἔσται πολὺν χρόνον εἰς βόσκημα, κἀκεῖ ἀναπαύσονται.
Καὶ μετὰ χρόνον οὐκ ἔσται ἐν αὐτῇ πᾶν χλωρὸν διὰ τὸ ξη- 11
ρανθῆναι· γυναῖκες ἐρχόμεναι ἀπὸ θέας δεῦτε· οὐ γὰρ λαὸς
ἐστιν ἔχων σύνεσιν, διὰ τοῦτο οὐ μὴ οἰκτηρήσῃ ὁ ποιήσας αὐ-
τούς, οὐδὲ ὁ πλάσας αὐτοὺς οὐ μὴ ἐλεήσῃ. Καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῇ 21
ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, συμφράξει Κύριος ἀπὸ τῆς διώρυγος τοῦ ποταμοῦ
ἕως Ῥινοκορούρων· ὑμεῖς δὲ συναγάγετε τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ
καθ᾿ ἕνα ἕνα. Καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, σαλπιοῦσιν ἐν τῇ 31
σάλπιγγι τῇ μεγάλῃ, καὶ ἥξουσιν οἱ ἀπολόμενοι ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ
τῶν Ἀσσυρίων, καὶ οἱ ἀπολόμενοι ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ, καὶ προσκυ-
νήσουσι τῷ Κυρίῳ ἐπὶ τὸ ὄρος τὸ ἅγιον ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΗ΄. XXVIII.

ΟΥΑΙ τῷ στεφάνῳ τῆς ὕβρεως οἱ μισθωτοὶ Ἐφραΐμ, τὸ 1
ἄνθος τὸ ἐκπεσὸν ἐκ τῆς δόξης αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τῆς κορυφῆς τοῦ
ὄρους τοῦ παχέως, οἱ μεθύοντες ἄνευ οἴνου. Ἰδοὺ ἰσχυρὸν καὶ 2
σκληρὸν ὁ θυμὸς Κυρίου, ὡς χάλαζα καταφερομένη οὐκ ἔχουσα σκέπην, βίᾳ καταφερομένη· ὡς ὕδατος πολὺ πλῆθος σύρον
χώραν, τῇ γῇ ποιήσει ἀνάπαυσιν ταῖς χερσί. Καὶ τοῖς ποσὶ 3
καταπατηθήσεται ὁ στέφανος τῆς ὕβρεως, οἱ μισθωτοὶ τοῦ
Ἐφραΐμ. Καὶ ἔσται τὸ ἄνθος τὸ ἐκπεσὸν τῆς ἐλπίδος τῆς δό- 4

**Chapter 27**

**4** I have rejected her; therefore for this cause hath the Lord God done all whatsoever He hath ordained.
**5** "I am utterly burned," shall those who dwell therein cry out, "Let us make peace with Him; let us make peace, O ye who come,
**6** O children of Jacob! Israel shall bud forth and blossom, and the inhabited earth shall be filled with his fruit."
**7** Shall the oppressor be smitten as He Himself smote [others]? And as he slew, so shall he be slain?
**8** Fighting and reproaching, He shall send them forth. Was it not Thou, O Lord, who didst meditate with the harsh spirit, to slay them with a spirit of wrath?
**9** Therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be taken away; and this is his blessing, when I shall take away his sin; when they shall set all the stones of the altars, cut down as fine dust; and their trees shall not remain, and their idols hewn down, as a distant grove.
**10** The inhabited flock shall be neglected, as a deserted flock; and it shall be for a long time for pasture, and there they shall rest.
**11** And after a time, there shall be no green thing in it because of its withering. Ye women coming from a spectacle, come! For it is not a people having understanding; therefore He who made them shall not pity them, nor shall He who formed them have mercy.
**21** And it shall be in that day, the Lord shall stop up [the way] from the canal of the river unto Rhinocoloura; but ye shall gather the sons of Israel one by one.
**31** And it shall be in that day, they shall sound the great trumpet; and those who were lost in the land of the Assyrians, and those who were lost in Egypt, shall come; and they shall worship the Lord upon the holy mountain in Jerusalem.

**Chapter 28**

**1** Woe to the crown of pride, the hired ones of Ephraim, the fading flower of his glory upon the top of the fat mountain, those who are drunk without wine!
**2** Behold, strong and harsh is the wrath of the Lord, like hail falling, against which there is no shelter, falling with violence; like a great multitude of water sweeping away a land, He shall make rest for the land with His hands.
**3** And by [His] feet shall be trampled the crown of pride, the hired ones of Ephraim.
**4** And the fading flower of the hope of his glory...
