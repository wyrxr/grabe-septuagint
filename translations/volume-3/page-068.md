**1006 ΨΑΛΤΗΡΙΟΝ. ΨΑΛΜ. ΠΗʹ.**
23 βραχίων μου κατισχύσει αὐτόν· οὐκ ὠφελήσει ἐχθρὸς ἐν αὐτῷ,
24 καὶ υἱὸς ἀνομίας οὐ κακώσει αὐτόν· καὶ συγκόψω τοὺς ἐχθροὺς
25 αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοὺς μισοῦντας αὐτὸν τροπώσο-
26 μαι. Καὶ ἡ ἀλήθειά μου καὶ τὸ ἔλεός μου μετ’ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐν τῷ
27 ὀνόματί μου ὑψωθήσεται τὸ κέρας αὐτοῦ· καὶ θήσομαι ἐν θαλάσ-
28 ση χεῖρα αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐν ποταμοῖς δεξιὰν αὐτοῦ. Αὐτὸς ἐπικαλέ-
29 σεταί με· πατήρ μου εἶ σύ, ὁ Θεός μου καὶ ἀντιλήπτωρ τῆς σω-
30 τηρίας μου· καὶ ἐγὼ πρωτότοκον θήσομαι αὐτόν, ὑψηλὸν παρὰ
31 τοῖς βασιλεῦσι τῆς γῆς. Εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα φυλάξω αὐτῷ τὸ ἔλεός
32 μου, καὶ ἡ διαθήκη μου πιστὴ αὐτῷ· καὶ θήσομαι εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα
33 τοῦ αἰῶνος τὸ σπέρμα αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὸν θρόνον αὐτοῦ ὡς τὰς ἡμέ-
34 ρας τοῦ οὐρανοῦ. Ἐὰν ἐγκαταλίπωσιν οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ τὸν νόμον
35 μου, καὶ ἐν τοῖς κρίμασί μου μὴ πορευθῶσιν· ἐὰν τὰ δικαιώματά
36 μου βεβηλώσωσι, καὶ τὰς ἐντολάς μου μὴ φυλάξωσιν· ἐπισκέψο-
37 μαι ἐν ῥάβδῳ τὰς ἀνομίας αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐν μάστιξι τὰς ἀδικίας αὐ-
38 τῶν· τὸ δὲ ἔλεός μου οὐ μὴ διασκεδάσω ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ, οὐδ’ οὐ μὴ
39 ἀδικήσω ἐν τῇ ἀληθείᾳ μου· οὐδὲ μὴ βεβηλώσω τὴν διαθήκην μου,
40 καὶ τὰ ἐκπορευόμενα διὰ τῶν χειλέων μου οὐ μὴ ἀθετήσω. Ἄπαξ
41 ὤμοσα ἐν τῷ ἁγίῳ μου, εἰ τῷ Δαυὶδ ψεύσομαι· τὸ σπέρμα αὐτοῦ
42 εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα μενεῖ, καὶ ὁ θρόνος αὐτοῦ ὡς ὁ ἥλιος ἐναντίον μου,
43 καὶ ὡς ἡ σελήνη κατηρτισμένη εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα· καὶ ὁ μάρτυς ἐν οὐ-
44 ρανῷ πιστός. Διάψαλμα. Σὺ δὲ ἀπώσω καὶ ἐξουδένωσας, ἀνεβά-
45 λου τὸν χριστόν σου· κατέστρεψας τὴν διαθήκην τοῦ δούλου σου,
46 ἐβεβήλωσας εἰς τὴν γῆν τὸ ἁγίασμα αὐτοῦ. Καθεῖλες πάντας τοὺς
47 φραγμοὺς αὐτοῦ, ἔθου τὰ ὀχυρώματα αὐτοῦ δειλίαν· διήρπαζον
48 αὐτὸν πάντες οἱ παραπορευόμενοι τὴν ὁδόν, ἐγενήθη ὄνειδος τοῖς
49 γείτοσιν αὐτοῦ. Ὕψωσας τὴν δεξιὰν τῶν θλιβόντων αὐτόν, εὐ-
50 φρανας πάντας τοὺς ἐχθροὺς αὐτοῦ· ἀπέστρεψας τὴν βοήθειαν τῆς
51 ῥομφαίας αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἀντελάβου αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ. Κατ-
52 έλυσας ἀπὸ καθαρισμοῦ αὐτοῦ· τὸν θρόνον αὐτοῦ εἰς τὴν γῆν
53 κατέῤῥαξας. Ἐσμίκρυνας τὰς ἡμέρας τοῦ χρόνου αὐτοῦ· κατέσχες
54 αὐτοῦ αἰσχύνην. Διάψαλμα. Ἕως πότε Κύριε ἀποστρέψεις εἰς τέ-
55 λος ; ἐκκαυθήσεται ὡς πῦρ ἡ ὀργή σου ; Μνήσθητι τίς μου ἡ ὑπό-
56 στασις· μὴ γὰρ ματαίως ἔκτισας πάντας τοὺς υἱοὺς τῶν ἀνθρώ-
57 πων ; Τίς ἐστιν ἄνθρωπος ὃς ζήσεται καὶ οὐκ ὄψεται θάνατον ;
58 ῥύσεται τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ ἐκ χειρὸς ᾅδου ; Διάψαλμα. Ποῦ εἰσι

**PSALM LXXXVIII.**

21 ...[My] arm shall strengthen him.
22 No enemy shall prevail against him,
Nor shall a son of lawlessness afflict him.
23 And I will cut down his foes before his face,
And them that hate him will I put to flight.
24 And My truth and My mercy shall be with him;
And in My Name shall his horn be exalted.
25 And I will set his hand in the sea,
And his right hand in the rivers.
26 He shall call upon Me, saying,
“Thou art My Father, My God,
And the Upholder of my salvation.”
27 And I will make him My firstborn,
High above the kings of the earth.
28 For ever will I keep My mercy for him,
And My covenant shall be faithful unto him.
29 And I will establish his seed for ever and ever,
And his throne as the days of heaven.
30 If his sons forsake My law,
And walk not in My judgments;
31 If they profane My statutes,
And keep not My commandments;
32 I will visit their transgressions with a rod,
And their iniquities with stripes.
33 But My mercy will I not utterly take from him,
Nor will I deal falsely in My truth.
34 Nor will I profane My covenant,
And what proceedeth from My lips will I not annul.
35 Once have I sworn by My holiness,
That I will not lie unto David;
36 His seed shall abide for ever,
And his throne as the sun before Me,
37 And as the moon established for ever,
And a faithful witness in heaven. Selah.

38 But Thou hast cast off and rejected,
Thou hast delayed Thine Anointed One.
39 Thou hast overthrown the covenant of Thy servant;
Thou hast profaned his sanctuary to the ground.
40 Thou hast broken down all his hedges;
Thou hast made his strongholds a dread.
41 All who pass by the way have plundered him;
He has become a reproach to his neighbors.
42 Thou hast exalted the right hand of those that afflict him;
Thou hast made all his enemies rejoice.
43 Thou hast turned back the help of his sword;
And Thou didst not help him in the battle.
44 Thou hast brought him low from his glory;
45 Thou hast cast down his throne to the ground.
Thou hast shortened the days of his time;
46 Thou hast held him fast with shame. Selah.

47 How long, O Lord, wilt Thou turn away utterly?
Shall Thy wrath burn like fire?
48 Remember what my substance is;
For surely Thou hast not created all the sons of men in vain?
49 What man is he that shall live and not see death?
Shall he deliver his soul from the hand of Hades? Selah.
