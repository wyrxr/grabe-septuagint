**ΚΕΦ. ΝΒ΄. ΝΓ΄. ΗΣΑΙΑΣ 1195**
συνέξουσι βασιλεῖς τὸ στόμα αὐτῶν· ὅτι οἷς οὐκ ἀνηγγέλη περὶ
αὐτοῦ, ὄψονται, καὶ οἱ οὐκ ἀκηκόασι, συνήσουσιν.

**ΚΕΦ. ΝΓ΄. LIII.**

**1.** ΚΥΡΙΕ, τίς ἐπίστευσε τῇ ἀκοῇ ἡμῶν; καὶ ὁ βραχίων Κυ-
ρίου ἐπὶ τίνι ἀπεκαλύφθη;
**2.** Ἀνηγγείλαμεν ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ ὡς παιδίον, ὡς ῥίζα ἐν γῇ διψώσῃ οὐκ ἔστιν εἶδος αὐτῷ, οὐδὲ δό-
ξα· καὶ εἴδομεν αὐτόν, καὶ οὐκ εἶχεν εἶδος οὐδὲ κάλλος, ἀλλὰ
**3.** τὸ εἶδος αὐτοῦ ἄτιμον, καὶ ἐκλεῖπον παρὰ πάντας ἀνθρώπους·
ἄνθρωπος ἐν πληγῇ ὢν, καὶ εἰδὼς φέρειν μαλακίαν, ὅτι ἀπέ-
στραπται τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ, ἠτιμάσθη καὶ οὐκ ἐλογίσθη.
**4.** Οὕτως τὰς ἁμαρτίας ἡμῶν φέρει, καὶ περὶ ἡμῶν ὀδυνᾶται, καὶ ἡμεῖς
ἐλογισάμεθα αὐτὸν εἶναι ἐν πόνῳ, καὶ ἐν πληγῇ ὑπὸ Θεοῦ, καὶ
ἐν κακώσει.
**5.** Αὐτὸς δὲ ἐτραυματίσθη διὰ τὰς ἁμαρτίας ἡμῶν,
καὶ ἐμαλακίσθη διὰ τὰς ἀνομίας ἡμῶν, παιδεία εἰρήνης ἡμῶν
ἐπ᾿ αὐτόν, τῷ μώλωπι αὐτοῦ ἡμεῖς ἰάθημεν.
**6.** Πάντες ὡς πρό-
βατα ἐπλανήθημεν· ἄνθρωπος τῇ ὁδῷ αὐτοῦ ἐπλανήθη, καὶ Κύ-
ριος παρέδωκεν αὐτὸν ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις ἡμῶν·
**7.** καὶ αὐτὸς διὰ τὸ
κεκακῶσθαι οὐκ ἀνοίγει τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ· ὡς πρόβατον ἐπὶ σφαγὴν
ἤχθη, καὶ ὡς ἀμνὸς ἐναντίον τοῦ κείραντος αὐτὸν ἄφωνος,
οὕτως οὐκ ἀνοίγει τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ.
**8.** Ἐν τῇ ταπεινώσει ἡ
κρίσις αὐτοῦ ἤρθη· τὴν γενεὰν αὐτοῦ τίς διηγήσεται; ὅτι αἴ-
ρεται ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς ἡ ζωὴ αὐτοῦ, ἀπὸ τῶν ἀνομιῶν τοῦ λαοῦ μου
ἤχθη εἰς θάνατον.
**9.** Καὶ δώσω τοὺς πονηροὺς ἀντὶ τῆς ταφῆς
αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοὺς πλουσίους ἀντὶ τοῦ θανάτου αὐτοῦ· ὅτι ἀνομίαν
οὐκ ἐποίησεν, οὐδὲ εὑρέθη δόλος ἐν τῷ στόματι αὐτοῦ,
**10.** καὶ Κύ-
ριος βούλεται καθαρίσαι αὐτὸν ἀπὸ τῆς πληγῆς· ἐὰν δῶται περὶ
ἁμαρτίας, ἡ ψυχὴ ὑμῶν ὄψεται σπέρμα μακρόβιον· καὶ βούλε-
ται Κύριος ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ ἀφελεῖν ἀπὸ τοῦ πόνου τῆς ψυχῆς
αὐτοῦ, δεῖξαι αὐτῷ φῶς, καὶ πλάσαι τῇ συνέσει,
**11.** δικαιῶσαι δί-
καιον εὖ δουλεύοντα πολλοῖς, καὶ τὰς ἁμαρτίας αὐτῶν αὐτὸς
ἀνοίσει.
**12.** Διὰ τοῦτο αὐτὸς κληρονομήσει πολλούς, καὶ τῶν ἰσχυ-
ρῶν μεριεῖ σκῦλα· ἀνθ᾿ ὧν παρεδόθη εἰς θάνατον ἡ ψυχὴ αὐτοῦ,
καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἀνόμοις ἐλογίσθη, καὶ αὐτὸς ἁμαρτίας πολλῶν ἀ-
νήνεγκε, καὶ διὰ τὰς ἀνομίας αὐτῶν παρεδόθη.

#### Chapter 52
... and kings shall close their mouths before Him; for they to whom it had not been told concerning Him shall see, and they who had not heard shall understand.

#### Chapter 53

**1** O Lord, who hath believed our report?
    And to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?
**2** For we declared before Him as of a child,
    as a root in a thirsty land.
    There is no form in Him, nor glory;
    and we beheld Him, and He had neither form nor beauty, but
**3** His form was dishonored,
    and more lacking than all men.
    A Man [being] in suffering,
    and knowing how to bear infirmity;
    for His face was turned away from us,
    He was dishonored and not esteemed.
**4** Surely, He doth bear our sins,
    and for our sakes He suffereth pain.
    And we accounted Him to be in sorrow,
    and smitten by God, and afflicted.
**5** Yet He was wounded for our sins,
    and was weakened for our iniquities;
    the chastisement for our peace was upon Him,
    and by His bruise we are healed.
**6** All of us, like sheep, have gone astray;
    each man hath gone astray in his own way;
    and the Lord hath delivered Him up to our sins.
**7** And He, because He was afflicted,
    openeth not His mouth.
    He was led as a sheep to the slaughter,
    and as a lamb before its shearer is silent,
    so He openeth not His mouth.
**8** In His humiliation His judgment was taken away.
    Who shall declare His generation?
    For His life is taken from the earth;
    for the iniquities of My people was He led unto death.
**9** And I will give the wicked in return for His burial,
    and the rich in return for His death;
    because He did no iniquity,
    neither was guile found in His mouth.
**10** And the Lord desireth to cleanse Him from the stroke.
    If He shall be given for sin,
    your souls shall see a long-lived seed.
    And the Lord desireth by His [own] hand to take away from the pain of His soul,
    to show Him light, and to fashion Him in understanding,
**11** to justify the Righteous One,
    who serveth many well;
    and He Himself shall bear their sins.
**12** Therefore shall He Himself inherit many,
    and of the strong shall He divide the spoils;
    in return for which His soul was delivered unto death,
    and He was reckoned among the lawless,
    and He Himself bore the sins of many,
    and for their iniquities was He delivered.
