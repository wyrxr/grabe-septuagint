**15** μως, ἵνα ὡς ἂν ἀκούσητε τῆς φωνῆς τῆς σάλπιγγος, σύριγγός τε,
καὶ κιθάρας, σαμβύκης τε, καὶ ψαλτηρίου, καὶ συμφωνίας, καὶ παντὸς γένους μουσικῶν, πεσόντες προσκυνήσητε τῇ εἰκόνι τῇ χρυσῇ
ᾗ ἐποίησα· ἐὰν δὲ μὴ προσκυνήσητε, αὕτη τῇ ὥρᾳ ἐμβληθήσεσθε
εἰς τὴν κάμινον τοῦ πυρὸς τὴν καιομένην· καὶ τίς ἐστιν ὁ Θεὸς ὃς
**16** ἐξελεῖται ὑμᾶς ἐκ χειρός μου; Καὶ ἀπεκρίθησαν Σεδράχ, Μισάχ,
Ἀβδεναγώ, λέγοντες τῷ βασιλεῖ Ναβουχοδονόσορ· οὐ χρείαν ἔχομεν ἡμεῖς περὶ τοῦ ῥήματος τούτου ἀποκριθῆναί σοι.
**17** Ἔστι γὰρ
ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν ἐν οὐρανοῖς, ᾧ ἡμεῖς λατρεύομεν, δυνατὸς ἐξελέσθαι
ἡμᾶς ἐκ τῆς καμίνου τοῦ πυρὸς τῆς καιομένης, καὶ ἐκ τῶν χειρῶν σου, βασιλεῦ, ῥύσεται ἡμᾶς.
**18** Καὶ ἐὰν μή, γνωστὸν ἔστω σοι
βασιλεῦ, ὅτι τοῖς θεοῖς σου οὐ λατρεύομεν, καὶ τῇ εἰκόνι τῇ χρυσῇ, ᾗ ἔστησας, οὐ προσκυνοῦμεν.
**19** Τότε Ναβουχοδονόσορ ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐπλήσθη θυμοῦ, καὶ ἡ ὄψις τοῦ προσώπου αὐτοῦ ἠλλοιώθη
ἐπὶ Σεδράχ, Μισάχ, καὶ Ἀβδεναγώ, καὶ εἶπεν ἐκκαῦσαι τὴν κάμινον ἑπταπλασίως, ἕως οὗ εἰς τέλος ἐκκαῇ.
**20** Καὶ ἄνδρας ἰσχυροὺς ἰσχύϊ εἶπε, πεδήσαντας τὸν Σεδράχ, Μισάχ, καὶ Ἀβδεναγώ,
**21** ἐμβαλεῖν εἰς τὴν κάμινον τοῦ πυρὸς τὴν καιομένην. Τότε οἱ ἄνδρες ἐκεῖνοι ἐπεδήθησαν σὺν τοῖς σαραβάροις αὐτῶν, καὶ τιάραις,
καὶ περικνημῖσι, καὶ ἐνδύμασιν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐβλήθησαν εἰς τὸ μέσον
**22** τῆς καμίνου τοῦ πυρὸς τῆς καιομένης, ἐπεὶ τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦ βασιλέως ὑπερίσχυε· καὶ ἡ κάμινος ἐξεκαύθη ἐκ περισσοῦ· καὶ τοὺς
ἄνδρας ἐκείνους τοὺς βάλλοντας Σεδράχ, Μισάχ, Ἀβδεναγώ, ἀπέκτεινεν ἡ φλὸξ τοῦ πυρός.
**23** Καὶ οἱ τρεῖς οὗτοι Σεδράχ, Μισάχ,
καὶ Ἀβδεναγώ, ἔπεσον εἰς μέσον τῆς καμίνου τοῦ πυρὸς τῆς καιομένης πεπεδημένοι, καὶ περιεπάτουν ἐν μέσῳ τῆς φλογός, ὑμνοῦντες τὸν Θεόν, καὶ εὐλογοῦντες τὸν Κύριον.
**24** Καὶ Ναβουχοδονόσορ ἤκουσεν ὑμνούντων αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐθαύμασε, καὶ ἐξανέστη ἐν
σπουδῇ, καὶ εἶπε τοῖς μεγιστᾶσιν αὐτοῦ, οὐχὶ ἄνδρας τρεῖς ἐβάλομεν εἰς τὸ μέσον τοῦ πυρὸς πεπεδημένους; καὶ εἶπον τῷ βασιλεῖ, ἀληθῶς, βασιλεῦ.
**25** Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεύς, ὁ δὲ ἐγὼ ὁρῶ ἄνδρας τέσσαρας λελυμένους, καὶ περιπατοῦντας ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ πυρὸς,
καὶ διαφθορὰ οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἡ ὅρασις τοῦ τετάρτου
**26** ὁμοία υἱῷ Θεοῦ. Τότε προσῆλθε Ναβουχοδονόσορ πρὸς τὴν θύραν
τῆς καμίνου τοῦ πυρὸς τῆς καιομένης, καὶ εἶπε, Σεδράχ, Μισάχ,
Ἀβδεναγώ, οἱ δοῦλοι τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ ὑψίστου, ἐξέλθετε καὶ δεῦτε

### Chapter 3

**15** ...[ye] be ready, so that whensoever ye hear the sound of the trumpet, and both the flute, and the harp, and both the sackbut, and the psaltery, and the dulcimer, and all kinds of musical instruments, ye fall down and worship the golden image which I have made; but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the selfsame hour into the burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hand?"

**16** Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and said unto the king Nebuchadnezzar, "We have no need to answer thee concerning this matter.
**17** For our God, whom we serve, is in the heavens, and He is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace; and out of thy hands, O king, will He deliver us.
**18** But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up."

**19** Then was Nebuchadnezzar the king filled with fury, and the expression of his countenance was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; and he commanded that they should heat the furnace sevenfold, until it be utterly burned.
**20** And he commanded mighty men of strength to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
**21** and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace. Then these men were bound in their turbans, and their tunics, and their hose, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace,
**22** because the king's command was urgent; and the furnace was exceedingly hot; and the flame of the fire slew those men who cast in Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
**23** And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down into the midst of the burning fiery furnace, bound; and they walked in the midst of the flame, hymning God and blessing the Lord.

**24** Then Nebuchadnezzar heard them hymning, and was astonished, and rose up in haste, and said unto his grandees, "Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire?" They answered and said unto the king, "True, O king."
**25** And the king answered and said, "Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and no harm is in them; and the appearance of the fourth is like unto a Son of God."
**26** Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the door of the burning fiery furnace, and spake, saying, "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of the Most High God, come forth, and come hither."
