ΨΑΛΤΗΡΙΟΝ. ΥΜΝ. Θ΄.
27 αἰῶνας. Ὅτι δίκαιος εἶ ἐπὶ πᾶσιν οἷς ἐποίησας ἡμῖν, καὶ πάντα τὰ
ἔργα σου ἀληθινά, καὶ εὐθεῖαι αἱ ὁδοί σου, καὶ πᾶσαι αἱ κρίσεις
28 σου ἀληθεῖς· καὶ κρίματα ἀληθείας ἐποίησας, κατὰ πάντα ὅσα
ἐπήγαγες ἡμῖν καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν πόλιν τὴν ἁγίαν τὴν τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν
Ἱερουσαλήμ· ἔτι ἐν ἀληθείᾳ καὶ κρίσει ἐπήγαγες ταῦτα πάντα
29 διὰ τὰς ἁμαρτίας ἡμῶν· ὅτι ἡμάρτομεν καὶ ἠνομήσαμεν ἀποστάν-
30 τες ἀπὸ σοῦ, καὶ ἐξημάρτομεν ἐν πᾶσι, καὶ τῶν ἐντολῶν σου οὐκ
ἠκούσαμεν, οὐδὲ συνετηρήσαμεν, οὐδὲ ἐποιήσαμεν καθὼς ἐνετείλω
31 ἡμῖν, ἵνα εὖ ἡμῖν γένηται. Καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐπήγαγες ἡμῖν, καὶ πάντα
32 ὅσα ἐποίησας ἡμῖν, ἐν ἀληθινῇ κρίσει ἐποίησας· καὶ παρέδωκας
ἡμᾶς εἰς χεῖρας ἐχθρῶν ἀνόμων καὶ ἐχθίστων ἀποστατῶν, καὶ
33 βασιλεῖ ἀδίκῳ καὶ πονηροτάτῳ παρὰ πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν. Καὶ νῦν οὐκ
ἔστιν ἡμῖν ἀνοῖξαι τὸ στόμα· αἰσχύνη καὶ ὄνειδος ἐγενήθη τοῖς
34 δούλοις σου καὶ τοῖς σεβομένοις σε. Μὴ δὴ παραδῷς ἡμᾶς εἰς τέ-
35 λος διὰ τὸ ὄνομά σου, καὶ μὴ διασκεδάσης τὴν διαθήκην σου, καὶ
μὴ ἀποστήσῃς τὸ ἔλεός σου ἀφ᾿ ἡμῶν, δι᾿ Ἀβραὰμ τὸν ἠγαπη-
36 μένον ὑπὸ σοῦ, καὶ διὰ Ἰσαὰκ τὸν δοῦλόν σου, καὶ Ἰσραὴλ τὸν
ἅγιον σου, οἷς ἐλάλησας πρὸς αὐτοὺς λέγων, πληθῦναι τὸ σπέρμα
αὐτῶν, ὡς τὰ ἄστρα τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ ὡς τὴν ἄμμον τὴν παρὰ τὸ
37 χεῖλος τῆς θαλάσσης. Ὅτι δέσποτα ἐσμικρύνθημεν παρὰ πάντα
τὰ ἔθνη, καὶ ἐσμὲν ταπεινοὶ ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ σήμερον διὰ τὰς ἁμαρ-
38 τίας ἡμῶν· καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν τῷ καιρῷ τούτῳ ἄρχων καὶ προφή-
της καὶ ἡγούμενος, οὐδὲ ὁλοκαύτωσις, οὐδὲ θυσία, οὐδὲ προσφορά,
οὐδὲ θυμίαμα, οὐδὲ τόπος τοῦ καρπῶσαι ἐνώπιόν σου, καὶ εὑρεῖν
39 ἔλεος· ἀλλ᾿ ἐν ψυχῇ συντετριμμένη καὶ πνεύματι ταπεινώσεως
40 προσδεχθείημεν. Ὡς ἐν ὁλοκαυτώμασι κριῶν καὶ ταύρων, καὶ ὡς ἐν
μυριάσιν ἀρνῶν πιόνων, οὕτως γενέσθω ἡ θυσία ἡμῶν ἐνώπιόν σου
σήμερον, καὶ ἐκτελέσαι ὄπισθέν σου· ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν αἰσχύνη τοῖς πε-
41 πειθόσιν ἐπί σοι. Καὶ νῦν ἐξακολουθοῦμεν ἐν ὅλῃ καρδίᾳ καὶ φοβού-
42 μεθά σε, καὶ ζητοῦμεν τὸ πρόσωπόν σου· μὴ καταισχύνης ἡμᾶς, ἀλ-
λὰ ποίησον μεθ᾿ ἡμῶν κατὰ τὴν ἐπιείκειάν σου, καὶ κατὰ τὸ πλῆθος
43 τοῦ ἐλέου σου· καὶ ἐξελοῦ ἡμᾶς κατὰ τὰ θαυμάσιά σου, καὶ δὸς δό-
44 ξαν τῷ ὀνόματί σου, Κύριε. Καὶ ἐντραπείησαν πάντες οἱ ἐνδεικνύ-
45 μενοι τοῖς δούλοις σου κακά, καὶ καταισχυνθείησαν ἀπὸ πάσης δυνά-
46 μεως καὶ δυνάσειας, καὶ ἡ ἰσχὺς αὐτῶν συντριβείη· καὶ γνώτωσαν,
47 ὅτι σὺ εἶ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς μόνος, καὶ ἔνδοξος ἐφ᾿ ὅλην τὴν οἰκουμένην.

**The Ninth Ode: The Prayer of Azariah.**

**27** unto the ages. For righteous art Thou in all that Thou hast done unto us,
And all Thy works are true, and straight are Thy paths,
And all Thy judgments are true.
**28** Yea, judgments of truth hast Thou wrought,
According to all that Thou hast brought upon us,
And upon the holy city, the city of our fathers, Jerusalem.
Moreover, in truth and in judgment hast Thou brought all these things upon us,
For our sins' sake;
**29** For we have sinned and committed iniquity,
**30** Withdrawing ourselves from Thee, and have transgressed in all things;
And Thy commandments have we not hearkened unto,
Neither have we kept them, nor done them as Thou didst command us,
**31** That it might be well with us.
And all that Thou hast brought upon us, and all
**32** That Thou hast wrought for us, in true judgment hast Thou wrought it;
And Thou hast delivered us into the hands of lawless enemies,
And of most hateful apostates,
**33** And unto a king unrighteous and most wicked above all the earth.
And now we have no mouth to open;
Shame and reproach are come upon Thy servants,
And upon them that worship Thee.
**34** Deliver us not up, therefore, utterly
**35** For Thy Name's sake, and break not Thy covenant,
And withdraw not Thy mercy from us,
For Abraham's sake, Thy beloved,
**36** And for Isaac Thy servant, and Israel Thy holy one,
To whom Thou didst speak, saying,
"I will multiply their seed as the stars of heaven,
And as the sand that is by the shore of the sea."
**37** For, O Master, we are become fewer than all the nations,
And are humbled in all the earth this day because of our sins;
**38** And there is not at this time a prince, nor prophet, nor leader,
Neither burnt offering, nor sacrifice, nor oblation, nor incense,
Nor any place where to offer firstfruits before Thee, and to find
**39** Mercy. But with a contrite soul and a spirit of humility
**40** May we be accepted. As in burnt offerings of rams and of bulls,
And as in ten thousands of fat lambs,
So let our sacrifice be before Thee this day,
And [that it may be] fulfilled after Thee;
For there is no shame to them that
**41** Trust in Thee. And now we follow with all our heart, and fear
**42** Thee, and seek Thy face;
Put us not to shame, but deal with us according to Thy gentleness,
And according to the multitude of Thy mercy;
**43** And deliver us according to Thy wondrous works,
And give glory unto Thy Name, O Lord.
**44** And let all them be put to shame that show
**45** Evil unto Thy servants,
And let them be disgraced from all their power and dominion,
**46** And their strength be crushed; and let them know,
**47** That Thou art the Lord God alone,
And glorious over all the inhabited earth.
