**Ω Σ Η Ε.**
**ΚΕΦΑΛΑΙΟΝ Α΄.**
**1** ΛΟΓΟΣ Κυρίου, ὃς ἐγενήθη ἡμέραις Ὀζίου, καὶ Ἰωάθαμ, καὶ Ἄχαζ, καὶ Ἑζεκίου βασιλέων Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐν ἡμέραις Ἰεροβοὰμ τοῦ υἱοῦ Ἰωὰς βασιλέως Ἰσραήλ.
**2** Ἀρχὴ λόγου Κυρίου πρὸς Ὡσηέ· καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Ὡσηέ· βάδιζε, λάβε σεαυτῷ γυναῖκα πορνείας, καὶ τέκνα πορνείας, διότι ἐκπορνεύουσα ἐκπορνεύσει ἡ γῆ ἀπὸ ὄπισθεν τοῦ Κυρίου.
**3** Καὶ ἐπορεύθη, καὶ ἔλαβε τὴν Γόμερ θυγατέρα Δεβηλαείμ· καὶ συνέλαβε, καὶ ἔτεκεν αὐτῷ υἱόν.
**4** Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς αὐτόν· κάλεσον τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ἰεζραήλ· διότι ἔτι μικρόν, καὶ ἐκδικήσω τὸ αἷμα τοῦ Ἰεζραὴλ ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον Ἰούδα, καὶ καταπαύσω βασιλείαν οἴκου Ἰσραήλ·
**5** καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, συντρίψω τὸ τόξον τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τῇ κοιλάδι τοῦ Ἰεζραήλ.
**6** Καὶ συνέλαβεν ἔτι, καὶ ἔτεκε θυγατέρα. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· κάλεσον τὸ ὄνομα αὐτῆς, οὐκ ἠλεημένη· διότι οὐ μὴ προσθήσω ἔτι ἐλεῆσαι τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, ἀλλ᾽ ἢ ἀντιτασσόμενος ἀντιτάξομαι αὐτοῖς.
**7** Τοὺς δὲ υἱοὺς Ἰούδα ἐλεήσω, καὶ σώσω αὐτοὺς ἐν Κυρίῳ Θεῷ αὐτῶν· καὶ οὐ σώσω αὐτοὺς ἐν τόξῳ, οὔτε ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ, οὔτε ἐν πολέμῳ, οὔτε ἐν ἅρμασιν, οὔτε ἐν ἵπποις, οὔτε ἐν ἱππεῦσι.
**8** Καὶ ἀπεγαλάκτισε τὴν οὐκ ἠλεημένην· καὶ συνέλαβεν ἔτι, καὶ ἔτεκεν υἱόν.
**9** Καὶ εἶπε, κάλεσον τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ, οὐ λαός μου· διότι ὑμεῖς οὐ λαός μου, καὶ ἐγὼ οὐκ εἰμὶ ὑμῶν.
**10** Καὶ ἦν ὁ ἀριθμὸς τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ ὡς ἡ ἄμμος τῆς θαλάσσης, ἢ οὐκ ἐκμετρηθήσεται, οὐδὲ ἐξαριθμηθήσεται· καὶ ἔσται, ἐν τῷ τόπῳ οὗ ἐῤῥέθη αὐτοῖς, οὐ λαός μου ὑμεῖς, (ἐκεῖ) κληθήσονται αὐτοὶ υἱοὶ Θεοῦ ζῶντος·
**11** Καὶ συναχθήσονται οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰούδα, καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό, καὶ θήσονται αὐτοῖς ἀρχὴν μίαν, καὶ ἀναβήσονται ἐκ τῆς γῆς, ὅτι μεγάλη ἡ ἡμέρα τοῦ Ἰεζραήλ.

**HOSEA.**
**CHAPTER 1.**

**1** The word of the LORD that came to pass in the days of Uzziah, and Jotham, and Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah; and in the days of Jeroboam, the son of Joash, king of Israel.

**2** The beginning of the word of the LORD unto Hosea. And the LORD said unto Hosea, "Go, take unto thyself a wife of harlotries, and children of harlotries; for the land shall grievously commit harlotry, [turning away] from behind the LORD."

**3** So he went and took Gomer, the daughter of Debelaim; and she conceived, and bare him a son.

**4** And the LORD said unto him, "Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Judah, and I will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.

**5** And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel."

**6** And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And He said unto him, "Call her name Unpitied; for I will no more add to have mercy upon the house of Israel, but I will utterly set myself against them.

**7** But I will have mercy upon the sons of Judah, and will save them by the LORD their God; and I will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by war, nor by chariots, nor by horses, nor by horsemen."

**8** Now when she had weaned Unpitied, she conceived again, and bare a son.

**9** And He said, "Call his name Not-My-People; for ye are not My people, and neither am I yours."

**10** Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which shall not be measured, neither shall be numbered. And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, "Ye are not My people," (there) they shall be called the sons of the living God.

**11** And the children of Judah and the children of Israel shall be gathered together into one [place], and they shall appoint for themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land; for great shall be the day of Jezreel.
