**7** κλοῦντες ἐν τῇ πόλει· ἐπάταξάν με, ἐτραυμάτισαν με· ἦραν τὸ θέρισμόν μου ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ φύλακες τῶν τειχέων.
**8** Ὤρκισα ὑμᾶς, θυγατέρες Ἱερουσαλήμ, ἐν ταῖς δυνάμεσι καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἰσχύσεσι τοῦ ἀγροῦ· ἐὰν εὕρητε τὸν ἀδελφιδόν μου, τί ἀπαγγείλητε αὐτῷ, ὅτι τετρωμένη ἀγάπης εἰμὶ ἐγώ.
**9** Τί ἀδελφιδός σου ἀπὸ ἀδελφιδοῦ, ἡ καλὴ ἐν γυναιξί; τί ἀδελφιδός σου ἀπὸ ἀδελφιδοῦ, ὅτι οὕτως ὤρκισας ἡμᾶς;
**10** Ἀδελφιδός μου λευκὸς καὶ πυῤῥός, ἐκλελογισμένος ἀπὸ μυριάδων.
**11** Κεφαλὴ αὐτοῦ χρυσίον Καιφάζ, βόστρυχοι αὐτοῦ ἐλάται, μέλανες ὡς κόραξ.
**12** Ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτοῦ ὡς περιστεραὶ ἐπὶ πληρώματα ὑδάτων, λελουμέναι ἐν γάλακτι, καθήμεναι ἐπὶ πληρώματι (ὑδάτων)·
**13** σιαγόνες αὐτοῦ ὡς φυταλιαὶ τοῦ ἀρώματος, φῦσαι μυρεψικά· χείλη αὐτοῦ κρῖνα, στάζοντα σμύρναν πλήρη.
**14** Χεῖρες αὐτοῦ τορευταὶ χρυσαῖ, πεπληρωμέναι Θαρσεῖς· κοιλία αὐτοῦ πυξίον ἐλεφάντινον ἐπὶ λίθου σαπφείρου·
**15** κνῆμαι αὐτοῦ στύλοι μαρμάρινοι, τεθεμελιωμένοι ἐπὶ βάσεσι χρυσαῖς.
**16** Εἶδος αὐτοῦ ὡς Λίβανος, ἐκλεκτὸς ὡς κέδροι· φάρυγξ αὐτοῦ γλυκασμοί, καὶ ὅλος ἐπιθυμία· οὗτος ἀδελφιδός μου, καὶ οὗτος πλησίον μου, θυγατέρες Ἱερουσαλήμ.
**17** Ποῦ ἀπῆλθεν ὁ ἀδελφιδός σου, ἡ καλὴ ἐν γυναιξί; ποῦ ἀπέβλεψεν ὁ ἀδελφιδός σου; καὶ ζητήσομεν αὐτὸν μετὰ σοῦ.

**ΚΕΦ. ς΄. VI.**
**1** Ἀδελφιδός μου κατέβη εἰς κῆπον αὐτοῦ εἰς φυταλιὰς τοῦ ἀρώματος, ποιμαίνειν ἐν κήποις, καὶ συλλέγειν κρῖνα.
**2** Ἐγὼ τῷ ἀδελφιδῷ μου, καὶ ὁ ἀδελφιδός μου ἐμοί, ὁ ποιμαίνων ἐν τοῖς κρίνοις.
**3** Καλή εἶ ἡ πλησίον μου, ὡς εὐδοκία, ὡραῖα ὡς Ἱερουσαλήμ, θάμβος ὡς τεταγμέναι.
**4** Ἀπόστρεψον ὀφθαλμούς σου ἀπεναντίον ἐμοῦ, ὅτι αὐτοὶ ἀνεπτέρωσάν με. Τρίχωμά σου ὡς ἀγέλαι τῶν αἰγῶν, αἳ ἀνεφάνησαν ἀπὸ τοῦ Γαλαάδ.
**5** Ὀδόντες σου ὡς ἀγέλαι τῶν κεκραμμένων, αἳ ἀνέβησαν ἀπὸ τοῦ λουτροῦ, αἱ πᾶσαι διδυμεύουσαι, καὶ ἀτεκνοῦσα οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν αὐταῖς.
**6** Ὡς σπαρτίον τὸ κόκκινον χείλη σου, καὶ ἡ λαλιά σου ὡραία· ὡς λέπυρον τῆς ῥοᾶς μῆλον σου ἐκτὸς τῆς σιωπήσεώς σου.
**7** Ἕξηκοντα εἰσι βασίλισσαι, καὶ ὀγδοήκοντα παλλακαί, καὶ νεάνιδες ὧν οὐκ ἔστιν ἀριθμός.
**8** Μία ἐστὶ περιστερά μου, τελεία μου· μία ἐστὶ τῇ μητρὶ αὐτῆς, ἐκλεκτὴ ἐστι τῇ τεκούσῃ αὐτήν· εἶδοσαν αὐτὴν θυγατέρες, καὶ μακαριοῦσιν αὐτήν,

**CHAPTER 5**

**7** The watchmen that went about the city found me;
    they smote me, they wounded me;
    they took away my cloak from me,
    even the keepers of the walls.
**8** I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
    by the powers and by the strengths of the field,
    if ye find my beloved,
    that ye tell him,
    that I am wounded with love.
**9** What is thy beloved more than [another] beloved,
    O thou fairest among women?
    What is thy beloved more than [another] beloved,
    that thou dost so adjure us?
**10** My beloved is white and ruddy,
    chosen out of ten thousands.
**11** His head is as Cephas' gold,
    his locks are fir trees,
    and black as a raven.
**12** His eyes are as doves
    upon the full streams of waters,
    washed in milk,
    sitting upon the full [streams of waters];
**13** His cheeks are as beds of spices,
    [as] plants of perfume;
    his lips are lilies,
    dropping abundant myrrh.
**14** His hands are as turned work of gold,
    filled with Tarshish [gems];
    his belly is an ivory box
    upon a sapphire stone;
**15** His legs are pillars of marble,
    founded upon bases of gold.
**16** His appearance is as Lebanon,
    excellent as the cedars;
    his throat is sweet delights,
    and he is altogether desirable.
    This is my beloved, and this is my companion,
    O daughters of Jerusalem.
**17** Whither is thy beloved gone,
    O thou fairest among women?
    Whither hath thy beloved turned?
    And we will seek him with thee.

**CHAPTER 6**

**1** My beloved is gone down into his garden,
    to the beds of spices,
    to feed in the gardens,
    and to gather lilies.
**2** I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine;
    he feedeth among the lilies.
**3** Thou art fair, my beloved, as goodwill,
    beautiful as Jerusalem,
    awe-inspiring as armies set in array.
**4** Turn away thine eyes from before me,
    for they have aroused me.
    Thy hair is as a flock of goats,
    that appear from Gilead.
**5** Thy teeth are as flocks of shorn sheep
    which ascend from the washing,
    all bearing twins,
    and there is not a barren one among them.
**6** Thy lips are as a scarlet thread,
    and thy speech is beautiful;
    thy cheek is as a peel of a pomegranate
    beyond thy silence.
**7** There are threescore queens,
    and fourscore concubines,
    and maidens without number.
**8** My dove, my perfect one, is but one;
    she is the only one of her mother,
    the choice one of her that bore her.
    The daughters saw her, and blessed her,
