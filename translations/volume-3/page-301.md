ΚΕΦ. ΙΕ´. ΙΕΡΕΜΙΑΣ 1239
σεν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ. Τίς φείσεται ἐπὶ σοί; καὶ τίς 5
δειλιάσει ἐπὶ σοί; ἢ τίς ἀνακάμψει ἐρωτῆσαι εἰς εἰρήνην σοι;
Σὺ ἀπεστράφης με, λέγει Κύριος· ὀπίσω μου πορεύσῃ, καὶ ἐκτε- 6
νῶ τὴν χεῖρά μου ἐπὶ σὲ, καὶ διαφθερῶ σε, καὶ οὐκέτι ἀνήσω
αὐτούς. Καὶ διασπερῶ αὐτοὺς ἐν διασπορᾷ, ἐν πύλαις λαοῦ μου 7
ἠτεκνώθησαν, ἀπώλεσαν τὸν λαόν μου διὰ τὰς κακίας αὐτῶν, 8
καὶ οὐκ ἐπεστράφησαν. Ἐπληθύνθησαν ἐπ’ ἐμὲ χῆραι αὐτῶν ὑ- 8
πὲρ τὴν ἄμμον τῆς θαλάσσης· ἐπήγαγον ἐπὶ μητέρα νεανίσκους
ταλαιπωρίαν ἐν μεσημβρίᾳ, ἐπέῤῥιψαν ἐπ’ αὐτὴν ἐξαίφνης τρόμον
καὶ σπουδήν. Ἐκενώθη ἡ τίκτουσα ἑπτά, ἀπεκάκησεν ἡ ψυχὴ 9
αὐτῆς, ἔπεδυ ὁ ἥλιος αὐτῇ ἔτι μεσούσης τῆς ἡμέρας, κατησχύνθη
καὶ ὠνειδίσθη· τοὺς καταλοίπους αὐτῶν εἰς μάχαιραν δώσω ἐ-
ναντίον τῶν ἐχθρῶν αὐτῶν, φησὶ Κύριος. Οἴμοι ἐγὼ, μῆτερ, 10
ὡς τίνα με ἔτεκες ἄνδρα δικαζόμενον, καὶ διακρινόμενον πάσῃ τῇ γῇ·
οὔτε ὠφέλησα, οὔτε ὠφέλησέ με οὐδεὶς· ἡ ἰσχύς μου ἐξέλιπεν ἐν τοῖς
καταρωμένοις με. Γένοιτο δέσποτα, κατευθυνόντων αὐτῶν· εἰ μὴ 11
παρέστην σοι ἐν καιρῷ τῶν κακῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐν καιρῷ θλίψεως αὐ-
τῶν, εἰς ἀγαθὰ πρὸς τὸν ἐχθρόν. Εἰ γνωσθήσεται σίδηρος; καὶ πε- 12
ριβόλαιον χαλκοῦν ἡ ἰσχύς σου. Καὶ τοὺς θησαυρούς σου εἰς προ- 13
νομὴν δώσω ἀντάλλαγμα, διὰ πάσας τὰς ἁμαρτίας σου· καὶ ἐν
πᾶσι τοῖς ὁρίοις σου. Καὶ καταδουλώσω σε κύκλῳ τοῖς ἐχθροῖς 14
σου, ἐν τῇ γῇ ᾗ οὐκ ᾔδεις· ὅτι πῦρ ἐκκέκαυται ἐκ τοῦ θυμοῦ
μου, ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς καυθήσεται. Σὺ ἔγνως, Κύριε, μνήσθητί μου, καὶ 15
ἐπίσκεψαί με, καὶ ἀθωῶσόν με ἀπὸ τῶν καταδιωκόντων με, μὴ
εἰς μακροθυμίαν σου λάβῃς με· γνῶθι, ὡς ἔλαβον περὶ σοῦ ὀ-
νειδισμὸν ὑπὸ τῶν ἀθετούντων τοὺς λόγους σου, συντέλεσον 16
αὐτοὺς, καὶ ἔσται ὁ λόγος σου ἐμοὶ εἰς εὐφροσύνην καὶ χαρὰν καρ-
δίας μου, ὅτι ἐπικέκληται τὸ ὄνομά σου ἐπ’ ἐμοὶ, Κύριε παντο-
κράτωρ. Οὐκ ἐκάθισα ἐν συνεδρίῳ αὐτῶν παιζόντων, ἀλλὰ εὐ- 17
λαβόμην ἀπὸ προσώπου χειρός σου· καταμόνας ἐκαθήμην, ὅτι
πικρίας ἐνεπλήσθην. Ἵνατί οἱ λυποῦντές με κατισχύουσί μου; ἢ 18
πληγή μου στερεά, πόθεν ἰάσομαι; γινομένη μοι ἐγενήθη ὡς
ὕδωρ ψευδές, οὐκ ἔχον πίστιν. Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Κύριος· 19
ἐὰν ἐπιστρέψῃς, καὶ ἀποκαταστήσω σε, καὶ πρὸ προσώπου μου
στῇσῃ· καὶ ἐὰν ἐξαγάγῃς τίμιον ἀπὸ ἀναξίου, ὡς στόμα μου
ἔσῃ· καὶ ἀναστρέψουσιν αὐτοὶ πρὸς σὲ, καὶ σὺ οὐκ ἀναστρέψεις

### JEREMIAH 15

**5** Who shall take pity on thee? And who shall grieve for thee? Or who shall turn back to inquire of thy peace?
**6** Thou hast turned away from Me, saith the Lord; backward from Me shalt thou go; and I will stretch forth My hand upon thee, and will destroy thee, and will no more show compassion unto them.
**7** And I will scatter them in dispersion; in the gates of My people have they been made childless; they have destroyed My people by reason of their wickedness,
**8** and they have not repented. Their widows are multiplied unto Me above the sand of the seas; I have brought upon the mother of young men tribulation at midday; I have cast upon her suddenly terror and panic.
**9** She that bore seven hath been emptied; her soul hath despaired; her sun went down while it was yet midday; she hath been put to shame and reviled. The remainder of them will I give to the sword before their enemies, saith the Lord.
**10** Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of contention, and one disputed against by all the earth! I have neither benefited [others], nor hath any man benefited me; my strength hath failed me among them that curse me.
**11** So be it, O Master! Let their way be made straight! Verily, I have stood by Thee in the time of their evils, and in the time of their tribulation, to [bring] good against the enemy.
**12** Shall iron be known [to prevail]? Verily, a brazen covering is Thy strength.
**13** And thy treasures will I give for plunder as a recompense, because of all thy sins; even in all thy borders.
**14** And I will enslave thee round about to thine enemies, in the land which thou knewest not; for fire is kindled from My wrath, and upon you all shall it burn.
**15** Thou hast known, O Lord; remember me, and visit me, and acquit me from them that persecute me; take me not into Thy long-suffering. Know, that I have received reproach for Thy sake from them that reject Thy words.
**16** Consume them, and Thy word shall be unto me for gladness and for joy of my heart, for Thy Name is called upon me, O Lord Almighty.
**17** I sat not in their council of them that made merry, but I was reverent before the face of Thy hand; alone I sat, for I was filled with bitterness.
**18** Wherefore do they that grieve me prevail against me? Or why is my wound grievous, from whence shall I be healed? Having come unto me, it became as deceptive water, having no faithfulness.
**19** Therefore thus saith the Lord: If thou return, then will I restore thee, and before My face shalt thou stand; and if thou bring forth the precious from the unworthy, thou shalt be as My mouth. And they shall return unto thee, but thou shalt not return unto them.
