ΚΕΦ. Βʹ. ΙΕΡΕΜΙΑΣ 1215
χόμενοι τοῦ νόμου μου, οὐκ ἐπίσταντό με, καὶ οἱ ποιμένες ἠσέβουν εἰς ἐμέ, καὶ οἱ προφῆται ἐπροφητεύοντο τῇ Βάαλ, καὶ ὀπίσω ἀνωφελοῦς ἐπορεύθησαν. Διὰ τοῦτο ἔτι κριθήσομαι πρὸς ὑμᾶς, 9
λέγει Κύριος, καὶ πρὸς τοὺς υἱοὺς τῶν υἱῶν ὑμῶν κριθήσομαι.
Διότι ἔλθετε εἰς νήσους Χεττιείμ, καὶ ἴδετε, καὶ εἰς Κηδὰρ ἀπο- 10
στείλατε, καὶ νοήσατε σφόδρα, καὶ ἴδετε εἰ γέγονε τοιαῦτα· εἰ 11
ἀλλάξωνται τὰ ἔθνη θεοὺς αὑτῶν, καὶ οὗτοι οὐκ εἰσὶ θεοί· ὁ δὲ
λαός μου ἠλλάξατο τὴν δόξαν αὑτοῦ, ἐξ ἧς οὐκ ὠφεληθήσονται.
Ἐξέστη οὐρανὸς ἐπὶ τούτῳ, καὶ ἔφριξεν ἐπὶ πλεῖον σφόδρα, λέγει 12
Κύριος. Ὅτι δύο καὶ πονηρὰ ἐποίησεν ὁ λαός μου· ἐμὲ ἐγκατέλιπον 13
πηγὴν ὕδατος ζῶντος, καὶ ὤρυξαν ἑαυτοῖς λάκκους συντετριμμένους,
οἳ οὐ δυνήσονται ὕδωρ συνέχειν. Μὴ δοῦλός ἐστιν Ἰσραήλ, ἢ οἰ- 14
κογενής ἐστι ; διατί εἰς προνομὴν ἐγένετο ; Ἐπ’ αὐτὸν ὠρύοντο 15
λέοντες, καὶ ἔδωκαν τὴν φωνὴν αὑτῶν, οἳ ἔταξαν τὴν γῆν αὑτοῦ
εἰς ἔρημον, καὶ αἱ πόλεις αὑτοῦ κατεσκάφησαν, παρὰ τὸ μὴ κα- 16
τοικεῖσθαι. Καὶ υἱοὶ Μέμφεως καὶ Τάφνας ἔγνωσάν σε καὶ κα-
τέπαιξάν σου. οὐχὶ ταῦτα ἐποίησέ σοι τὸ καταλιπεῖν σε ἐμέ, λέγει 17
Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου, ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἀγοντός σε ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ; Καὶ 18
νῦν τί σοι καὶ τῇ ὁδῷ Αἰγύπτου τοῦ πιεῖν ὕδωρ Γηῶν; καὶ τί
σοι καὶ τῇ ὁδῷ Ἀσσυρίων τοῦ πιεῖν ὕδωρ ποταμῶν; Παιδεύσει 19
σε ἡ ἀποστασία σου, καὶ ἡ κακία σου ἐλέγξει σε· καὶ γνῶθι, καὶ
ἴδε, ὅτι πικρὸν καὶ πονηρόν σοι τὸ καταλιπεῖν σε ἐμέ, λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου· καὶ οὐκ ηὐδόκησα ἐν σοί, λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεός
σου. Ὅτι ἀπ᾿ αἰῶνος συνέτριψας τὸν ζυγόν σου, καὶ διέσπασας 20
τοὺς δεσμούς σου, καὶ εἶπας, οὐ δουλεύσω, ἀλλὰ πορεύσομαι ἐπὶ
πάντα βουνὸν ὑψηλόν, καὶ ὑποκάτω παντὸς ξύλου κατασκίου,
ἐκεῖ διαχυθήσομαι ἐν τῇ πορνείᾳ μου. Ἐγὼ δὲ ἐφύτευσά σε ἄμ- 21
πελον καρποφόρον ἀληθινὴν πᾶσαν· πῶς ἐστράφης εἰς πικρίαν
ἢ ἄμπελος ἡ ἀλλοτρία; Ἐὰν ἀποπλύνῃ ἐν νίτρῳ, καὶ πληθύνῃς 22
σεαυτῇ πόαν, κεχλιδώσαι ἐναντίον ἐμοῦ ἐν ταῖς ἀδικίαις σου,
λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου. Πῶς ἐρεῖς, οὐκ ἐμιάνθην, καὶ ὀπίσω 23
τῆς Βάαλ οὐκ ἐπορεύθην; ἴδε τὰς ὁδούς σου ἐν τῷ πολυανδρίῳ,
καὶ γνῶθι τί ἐποίησας· ὑψὲ φωνὴ αὐτῆς ὠλόλυζε, τὰς ὁδοὺς 24
αὐτῆς ἐπλάτυνεν ἐφ᾿ ὕδατα ἐρήμου, ἐν ἐπιθυμίᾳ ψυχῆς αὐτῆς
ἐπνευματοφορεῖτο, παρεδόθη, τίς ἐπιστρέψει αὐτήν; πάντες οἱ

**8** The shepherds also transgressed against Me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after that which profiteth not.
**9** "Therefore yet will I contend with you," saith the Lord, "yea, and with your sons' sons will I contend.
**10** For come ye now unto the islands of Kittim, and see; and send unto Kedar, and consider diligently, and see if such a thing hath come to pass:
**11** If the nations have changed their gods, which yet are no gods; but My people have changed their Glory, from Whom they shall not profit.
**12** The heavens were astonished at this, and shuddered exceeding greatly," saith the Lord.
**13** "For My people have committed two evils: they have forsaken Me, the Fountain of living waters, and have hewn out for themselves broken cisterns, which cannot hold water.
**14** Is Israel a slave? Or is he a home-born servant? Why then is he become a spoil?
**15** Against him did lions roar, and gave forth their voice; they have made his land a desolation, and his cities are utterly destroyed, so that they are not inhabited.
**16** And the sons of Memphis and Tahpanhes have known thee, and have scorned thee.
**17** Hath not this come upon thee because thou hast forsaken Me," saith the Lord thy God, "at the time when I led thee in the wilderness?
**18** And now, what hast thou to do with the way of Egypt, that thou shouldest drink the water of Gihon? Or what hast thou to do with the way of Assyria, that thou shouldest drink the water of the rivers?
**19** Thine own apostasy shall chasten thee, and thy wickedness shall reprove thee. Know therefore and see, that it is an evil and a bitter thing, that thou hast forsaken Me," saith the Lord thy God; "and that I have not delighted in thee," saith the Lord thy God.
**20** "For of old hast thou broken thy yoke, and burst thy bonds; and thou saidst, 'I will not serve,' but 'I will go upon every high hill, and under every shady tree, there will I pour myself out in my harlotry.'
**21** Yet I had planted thee a vine, entirely true and fruitful; how then art thou turned into bitterness, [even as] a strange vine?
**22** Though thou wash thyself with nitre, and use much soap, yet thou art grown wanton before Me in thine iniquities," saith the Lord thy God.
**23** "How canst thou say, 'I am not polluted,' and 'I have not walked after Baal'? See thy ways in the valley of many men, and know what thou hast done.
**24** Loudly her voice wailed, she enlarged her ways unto the waters of the wilderness; in the desire of her soul she was carried forth [by her lust]; she was given over: who shall turn her back? All they that..."
