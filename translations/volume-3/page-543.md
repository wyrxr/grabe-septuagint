12 δεχόμενος ἐκδέξομαι τοὺς καταλοίπους τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ
θήσομαι τὴν ἀποστροφὴν αὐτῶν. Ὡς πρόβατα ἐν θλίψει, ὡς ποί-
μνιον ἐν μέσῳ κοίτης αὐτῶν ἐξαλοῦνται ἐξ ἀνθρώπων·
13 διὰ τῆς διακοπῆς πρὸ προσώπου αὐτῶν διέκοψαν, καὶ διῆλθον πύλην, καὶ
ἐξῆλθον δι’ αὐτῆς· καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ὁ βασιλεὺς αὐτῶν πρὸ προσώπου
αὐτῶν, ὁ δὲ Κύριος ἡγήσεται αὐτῶν.

ΚΕΦ. Γ'. ΙΙΙ.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐρεῖ· ἀκούσατε δὴ ταῦτα αἱ ἀρχαὶ οἴκου Ἰακώβ, καὶ οἱ
κατάλοιποι οἴκου Ἰσραήλ· οὐχ ὑμῖν ἐστι τοῦ γνῶναι τὸ χρῖμα;
2 Οἱ μισοῦντες τὰ καλά, καὶ ζητοῦντες τὰ πονηρά, ἁρπάζοντες
τὰ δέρματα αὐτῶν ἀπ’ αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰς σάρκας αὐτῶν ἀπὸ τῶν
ὀστέων αὐτῶν.
3 Ὃν τρόπον κατέφαγον τὰς σάρκας τοῦ λαοῦ μου,
καὶ τὰ δέρματα αὐτῶν ἀπ’ αὐτῶν ἐξέδειραν, καὶ τὰ ὀστᾶ αὐτῶν
συνέθλασαν, καὶ ἐμέλισαν ὡς σάρκας εἰς λέβητα, καὶ ὡς κρέα εἰς
χύτραν,
4 οὕτως κεκράξονται πρὸς Κύριον, καὶ οὐκ εἰσακούσεται
αὐτῶν· καὶ ἀποστρέψει τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἀπ’ αὐτῶν ἐν τῷ και-
ρῷ ἐκείνῳ, ἀνθ’ ὧν ἐπονηρεύσαντο ἐν τοῖς ἐπιτηδεύμασιν αὐτῶν
ἐπ’ αὐτούς.
5 Τάδε λέγει Κύριος ἐπὶ τοὺς προφήτας τοὺς πλα-
νῶντας τὸν λαόν μου, τοὺς δάκνοντας ἐν τοῖς ὀδοῦσιν αὐτῶν, καὶ
κηρύσσοντας ἐπ’ αὐτὸν εἰρήνην, καὶ οὐκ ἐδόθη εἰς τὸ στόμα αὐ-
τῶν, ἤγειραν ἐπ’ αὐτὸν πόλεμον·
6 διὰ τοῦτο νὺξ ὑμῖν ἔσται ἐξ
δράσεως, καὶ σκοτία ἔσται ὑμῖν ἐκ μαντείας, καὶ δύσεται ὁ ἥλιος
ἐπὶ τοὺς προφήτας, καὶ συσκοτάσει ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς ἡ ἡμέρα·
7 καὶ
καταισχυνθήσονται οἱ ὁρῶντες τὰ ἐνύπνια, καὶ καταγελασθήσον-
ται οἱ μάντεις, καὶ καταλαλήσουσι κατ’ αὐτῶν πάντες αὐτοί,
διότι οὐκ ἔσται ὁ ἐπακούων αὐτῶν.
8 Ἐὰν μὴ ἐμπλήσω ἐγὼ ἰσχὺν
ἐν πνεύματι Κυρίου καὶ κρίματος καὶ δυναστείας, τοῦ ἀπαγγεῖ-
λαι τῷ Ἰακὼβ ἀσεβείας αὐτοῦ, καὶ τῷ Ἰσραὴλ ἁμαρτίας αὐτοῦ.
9 Ἀκούσατε δὴ ταῦτα οἱ ἡγούμενοι οἴκου Ἰακώβ, καὶ οἱ κατάλοι-
ποι οἴκου Ἰσραήλ, οἱ βδελυσσόμενοι κρῖμα, καὶ πάντα τὰ ὀρθὰ
διαστρέφοντες,
10 οἱ οἰκοδομοῦντες Σιὼν ἐν αἵμασι, καὶ Ἱερουσα-
λὴμ ἐν ἀδικίαις·
11 οἱ ἡγούμενοι αὐτῆς μετὰ δώρων ἔκρινον, καὶ οἱ
ἱερεῖς αὐτῆς μετὰ μισθοῦ ἀπεκρίνοντο, καὶ οἱ προφῆται αὐτῆς
μετὰ ἀργυρίου ἐμαντεύοντο, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν Κύριον ἐπανεπαύοντο,

### Micah
#### Chapter 2

**12** I shall surely receive the remnant of Israel; upon the same [place] will I gather their turning back. As sheep in distress, as a flock in the midst of their fold, they shall leap forth from among men.
**13** By means of the breach before their face, they have broken through, and they passed through a gate, and went out by it. And their king went out before their face, and the Lord shall be their leader.

#### Chapter 3

**1** And he shall say: Hear now these things, ye rulers of the house of Jacob, and ye remnant of the house of Israel: Is it not for you to know the anointing?
**2** Ye who hate the good, and seek the evil; snatching their skins from them, and their flesh from their bones.
**3** In what manner they devoured the flesh of My people, and stripped their skins from them, and crushed their bones, and chopped them as flesh into a cauldron, and as meat into a pot:
**4** Thus shall they cry unto the Lord, and He will not hearken unto them; and He shall turn away His face from them in that time, because of the evils which they wrought in their practices against them.
**5** Thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets who lead My people astray, who bite with their teeth, and preach peace upon them; and though it was not given into their mouth, they roused war against them.
**6** Therefore night shall be unto you from action, and darkness shall be unto you from divination; and the sun shall set upon the prophets, and the day shall grow dark upon them.
**7** And the seers of dreams shall be shamed, and the diviners shall be put to scorn; and all of them shall speak against them, because there shall be none to hearken unto them.
**8** But as for me, I shall fill [my] strength through the Spirit of the Lord, and with judgment, and with might, to declare unto Jacob his impieties, and unto Israel his sins.
**9** Hear now these things, ye leaders of the house of Jacob, and ye remnant of the house of Israel, who abhor judgment, and pervert all that is right;
**10** who build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquities.
**11** Her leaders judged for gifts, and her priests answered for hire, and her prophets divined for silver; yet they leaned upon the Lord,
