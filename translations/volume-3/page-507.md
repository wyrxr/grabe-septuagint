KEΦ. Θ´. Δ Α Ν Ι 1445
Θεὸς ἡμῶν ἐπὶ πᾶσαν τὴν ποίησιν αὐτοῦ ἣν ἐποίησε, καὶ οὐκ εἰ-
σηκούσαμεν τῆς φωνῆς αὐτοῦ. Καὶ νῦν, Κύριε ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν, ὃς 15
ἐξήγαγες τὸν λαόν σου ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου ἐν χειρὶ κραταιᾷ, καὶ
ἐποίησας σεαυτῷ ὄνομα ὡς ἡ ἡμέρα αὕτη, ἡμάρτομεν, ἠνομήσα-
μεν. Κύριε, ἐν πάσῃ ἐλεημοσύνῃ σου, ἀποστραφήτω δὴ ὁ θυμός 16
σου, καὶ ἡ ὀργή σου ἀπὸ τῆς πόλεώς σου Ἱερουσαλὴμ ὄρους ἁγίου
σου, ὅτι ἡμάρτομεν, καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἀδικίαις ἡμῶν, καὶ τῶν πατέ-
ρων ἡμῶν, Ἱερουσαλὴμ καὶ ὁ λαός σου εἰς ὀνειδισμὸν ἐγένετο ἐν
πᾶσι τοῖς περικύκλῳ ἡμῶν. Καὶ νῦν, Κύριε ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν, εἰσ- 17
άκουσον τῆς προσευχῆς τοῦ δούλου σου καὶ τῶν δεήσεων αὐτοῦ,
καὶ ἐπίφανον τὸ πρόσωπόν σου ἐπὶ τὸ ἁγίασμά σου τὸ ἔρημον,
ἕνεκέν σου, Κύριε. Κλῖνον, ὁ Θεός μου, τὸ οὖς σου, καὶ ἄκου- 18
σον· καὶ ἄνοιξον τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς σου, καὶ ἴδε τὸν ἀφανισμὸν ἡμῶν,
καὶ τῆς πόλεώς σου Ἱερουσαλήμ, ἐφ᾿ ἧς ἐπικέκληται τὸ ὄνομά
σου ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς· ὅτι οὐκ ἐπὶ ταῖς δικαιοσύναις ἡμῶν ἡμεῖς ῥιπτοῦ-
μεν τὸν οἰκτιρμόν ἡμῶν ἐνώπιόν σου, ἀλλ᾿ ἐπὶ τοὺς οἰκτιρμούς σου
τοὺς πολλούς, Κύριε. Κύριε ἄκουσον, Κύριε ἱλάσθητι, Κύριε 19
πρόσχες, καὶ ποίησον, (καὶ) μὴ χρονίσῃς, ἕνεκέν σου, Κύριε ὁ
Θεός μου, ὅτι τὸ ὄνομά σου ἐπικέκληται ἐπὶ τὴν πόλιν σου, καὶ
ἐπὶ τὸν λαόν σου. Καὶ ἔτι μου λαλοῦντος, καὶ προσευχομένου, 20
καὶ ἐξαγορεύοντός μου τὰς ἁμαρτίας μου, καὶ τὰς ἁμαρτίας τοῦ
λαοῦ μου Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ῥιπτοῦντος τὸν ἔλεόν μου ἐναντίον τοῦ
Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ μου περὶ τοῦ ὄρους τοῦ ἁγίου τοῦ Θεοῦ μου. Καὶ 21
ἔτι μου λαλοῦντος καὶ προσευχομένου ἐν τῇ προσευχῇ, καὶ ἰδοὺ
ἀνὴρ Γαβριήλ, ὃν εἶδον ἐν τῇ ὁράσει ἐν τῇ ἀρχῇ, πετόμενος, καὶ
ἥψατό μου, ὡσεὶ ὥραν θυσίας ἑσπερινῆς, καὶ συνέτισέ με, καὶ 22
ἐλάλησε μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ, καὶ εἶπε· Δανιήλ, νῦν ἐξῆλθον συμβιβάσαι σε
σύνεσιν. Ἐν ἀρχῇ τῆς δεήσεώς σου ἐξῆλθε λόγος, καὶ ἐγὼ ἦλ- 23
θον τοῦ ἀναγγεῖλαί σοι, ὅτι ἀνὴρ ἐπιθυμιῶν σὺ εἶ, καὶ ἐννοήθητι
ἐν τῷ σήματι, καὶ σύνες ἐν τῇ ὀπτασίᾳ. Ἑβδομήκοντα ἑβδομά- 24
δες συνετμήθησαν ἐπὶ τὸν λαόν σου Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν πόλιν
τὴν ἁγίαν σου, τοῦ συντελέσαι ἁμαρτίαν, καὶ τοῦ σφραγίσαι (ῥ-ρασιν)
ἁμαρτίας, καὶ ἀπαλεῖψαι τὰς ἀνομίας, καὶ τοῦ ἐξιλάσασθαι ἀδικίας,
καὶ τοῦ ἀγαγεῖν δικαιοσύνην αἰώνιον˙ καὶ τοῦ σφραγίσαι ὅρασιν
καὶ προφήτην, καὶ τοῦ χρῖσαι ἅγιον ἁγίων. Καὶ 25 γνώσῃ καὶ
συνήσεις, ἀπὸ ἐξόδου λόγου τοῦ ἀποκριθῆναι, καὶ τοῦ

**9:14** our God upon all His work which He hath done, and we have not obeyed His voice.
**15** And now, O Lord our God, Who didst bring forth thy people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and didst make for thyself a Name as at this day; we have sinned, and have committed iniquity.
**16** O Lord, according to all thy mercies, let thy wrath and thy fury, we pray thee, turn away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain; for we have sinned, and in our iniquities, and those of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people have become a reproach among all them that are round about us.
**17** And now, O Lord our God, hearken unto the prayer of thy servant and to his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary which is desolate, for thy sake, O Lord.
**18** Incline thine ear, O my God, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolation, and [that] of thy city Jerusalem, over which thy Name is called; for it is not upon our own righteousness that we cast forth our petition for mercy before thee, but upon thy many mercies, O Lord.
**19** O Lord, hear; O Lord, be merciful; O Lord, attend, and do [it], (and) tarry not, for thy sake, O Lord my God, for thy Name is called upon thy city, and upon thy people.
**20** And whilst I was yet speaking, and praying, and confessing my sins, and the sins of my people Israel, and casting forth my petition for mercy before the Lord my God concerning the holy mountain of my God;
**21** Yea, whilst I was yet speaking and praying in the prayer, behold, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the first, flying swiftly, and he touched me, about the time of the evening sacrifice; and he instructed me, and
**22** spake with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee understanding.
**23** At the beginning of thy supplication the word came forth, and I am come to declare it unto thee; for thou art a man greatly beloved. Therefore consider the sign, and understand the vision.
**24** Seventy weeks are decreed upon thy people Israel, and upon thy holy city, to finish sin, and to seal [ῥ-ρασιν] sin, and to wipe out iniquities, and to make atonement for injustices, and to bring in everlasting righteousness; and to seal vision and prophet, and to anoint the Most Holy.
**25** Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the word to answer, and to
