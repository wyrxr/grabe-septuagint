**6** Δανιήλ, οὗ τὸ ὄνομα Βαλτάσαρ κατὰ τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ Θεοῦ μου, ὃς πνεῦμα Θεοῦ ἅγιον ἐν ἑαυτῷ ἔχει· καὶ τὸ ἐνύπνιον ᾧ εἶπα, Βαλτάσαρ ὁ ἄρχων τῶν ἐπαοιδῶν, ἐν ἐγὼ ἔγνων ὅτι πνεῦμα Θεοῦ ἅγιον ἐν σοί, καὶ πᾶν μυστήριον οὐκ ἀδυνατεῖ σε, ἄκουσον τὴν ὄρασιν τοῦ ἐνυπνίου μου, οὗ ἴδον, καὶ τὴν σύγκρισιν αὐτοῦ εἰπὸν μοι.
**7** Ἐπὶ τῆς κοίτης μου ἐθεώρουν, καὶ ἰδοὺ δένδρον ἐν μέσῳ τῆς γῆς, καὶ τὸ ὕψος αὐτοῦ πολύ.
**8** Ἐμεγαλύνθη τὸ δένδρον ἐκεῖνο καὶ ἴσχυσε, καὶ τὸ ὕψος αὐτοῦ ἔφθασεν ἕως τοῦ οὐρανοῦ,
**9** καὶ τὸ κῦτος αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸ πέρας ἁπάσης τῆς γῆς, τὰ φύλλα αὐτοῦ ὡραῖα, καὶ ὁ καρπὸς αὐτοῦ πολύς, καὶ τροφὴ πάντων ἐν αὐτῷ, καὶ ὑποκάτω αὐτοῦ κατεσκήνουν τὰ θηρία τὰ ἄγρια, καὶ ἐν τοῖς κλάδοις αὐτοῦ κατῴχουν τὰ ὄρνεα τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ ἐξ αὐτοῦ ἐτρέφετο πᾶσα σάρξ.
**10** Ἐθεώρουν ἐν δράματι τῆς νυκτὸς ἐπὶ τῆς κοίτης μου ἐγρήγορος, καὶ ἰδοὺ εἷς, καὶ ἅγιος ἀπ᾿ οὐρανοῦ κατέβη,
**11** καὶ ἐφώνησεν ἐν ἰσχύϊ, καὶ οὕτως εἶπεν, ἐκκόψατε τὸ δένδρον, καὶ ἐκτίλατε τοὺς κλάδους αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐκτινάξατε τὰ φύλλα αὐτοῦ, καὶ διασκορπίσατε τὸν καρπὸν αὐτοῦ· σαλευθήτωσαν τὰ θηρία ὑποκάτωθεν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰ ὄρνεα ἀπὸ τῶν κλάδων αὐτοῦ.
**12** Πλὴν τὴν φύην τῶν ῥιζῶν αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ γῇ ἐάσατε, καὶ ἐν δεσμῷ σιδηρῷ καὶ χαλκῷ, καὶ ἐν τῇ χλόῃ τῇ ἔξω, καὶ ἐν τῇ δρόσῳ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ κοιτασθήσεται, καὶ μετὰ τῶν θηρίων ἡ μερὶς αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ χόρτῳ τῆς γῆς.
**13** Ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τῶν ἀνθρώπων ἀλλοιωθήσεται, καὶ καρδία θηρίου δοθήσεται αὐτῷ, καὶ ἑπτὰ καιροὶ ἀλλαγήσονται ἐπ᾿ αὐτόν.
**14** Διὰ συγκρίματος εἷς ὁ λόγος, καὶ ῥῆμα ἁγίων τὸ ἐπερώτημα, ἵνα γνῶσιν οἱ ζῶντες, ὅτι Κύριός ἐστιν ὁ ὕψιστος τῆς βασιλείας τῶν ἀνθρώπων, καὶ ᾧ ἐὰν δόξῃ, δώσει αὐτήν, καὶ ἐξουδένομα ἀνθρώπων ἀναστήσει ἐπ᾿ αὐτήν.
**15** Τοῦτο τὸ ἐνύπνιον ὃ ἴδον ἐγὼ Ναβουχοδονόσορ ὁ βασιλεύς, καὶ σὺ Βαλτάσαρ, τὸ σύγκριμα εἰπόν, ὅτι πάντες οἱ σοφοὶ τῆς βασιλείας μου οὐ δύνανται τὸ σύγκριμα αὐτοῦ δηλῶσαί μοι· σὺ δέ, Δανιήλ, δύνασαι. ὅτι πνεῦμα Θεοῦ ἐν σοί! ἅγιον.
**16** Τότε Δανιήλ, οὗ τὸ ὄνομα Βαλτάσαρ, ἀπηνεώθη ὡσεὶ ὥραν μίαν, καὶ οἱ διαλογισμοὶ αὐτοῦ συνετάρασσον αὐτόν· καὶ ἀπεκρίθη ὁ βασιλεύς, καὶ εἶπε· Βαλτάσαρ, τὸ ἐνύπνιον καὶ ἡ σύγκρισις μὴ κατασπευσάτω σε· καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Βαλτάσαρ, καὶ εἶπε, Κύριε, ἔστω τὸ ἐνύπνιον τοῖς μισοῦσί σε, καὶ ἡ σύγκρισις αὐτοῦ τοῖς ἐχθροῖς σου.

**6** Daniel, whose name is Belteshazzar, according to the name of my God, who hath the Holy Spirit of God within him; and the dream which I told, Belteshazzar, chief of the enchanters—in I myself knew that the Holy Spirit of God is in thee, and no mystery is impossible for thee—hear the vision of my dream which I saw, and declare its interpretation unto me.
**7** I beheld upon my bed, and lo, a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height was great.
**8** The tree grew great and strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven,
**9** and the bulk thereof to the end of all the earth; its leaves were fair, and its fruit was abundant, and food for all was in it; and beneath it lodged the wild beasts, and in its branches dwelt the fowls of the heaven, and from it was fed all flesh.
**10** I beheld in the vision of the night upon my bed, being awake, and behold, one, even a holy one, descended from heaven,
**11** and he cried with might, and thus he said: "Cut down the tree, and strip off its branches, and shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit; let the beasts be moved from under it, and the fowls from its branches."
**12** "Nevertheless, leave the stump of its roots in the earth, and in a bond of iron and bronze, and in the grass outside; and with the dew of heaven shall it lie down, and with the beasts shall its portion be in the grass of the earth."
**13** "His heart shall be changed from [that of] men, and a beast's heart shall be given unto him, and seven times shall pass over him."
**14** "This word is by a decree of judgment, and the demand is by the word of the holy ones, to the intent that the living may know that the Lord Most High is [sovereign] over the kingdom of men, and to whomsoever it seemeth good, He will give it, and He shall set up over it one of no account among men."
**15** This is the dream which I, King Nebuchadnezzar, have seen. And thou, Belteshazzar, tell the interpretation, for all the wise men of my kingdom cannot make known unto me the interpretation thereof; but thou, Daniel, art able, for the Spirit of God is in thee; a holy [Spirit indeed].
**16** Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonished for about one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. And the king answered and said, "Belteshazzar, let not the dream, nor the interpretation thereof, trouble thee."
**17** And Belteshazzar answered and said, "My Lord, let the dream be for them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof for thine enemies."
