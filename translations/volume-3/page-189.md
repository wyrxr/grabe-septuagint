καὶ ἐπὶ πάντα πύργον ὑψηλόν, καὶ ἐπὶ πᾶν τεῖχος ὑψηλόν, **15**
καὶ ἐπὶ πᾶν πλοῖον θαλάσσης, καὶ ἐπὶ πᾶσαν θέαν πλοίων κάλλους· **16**
καὶ ταπεινωθήσεται πᾶς ἄνθρωπος, καὶ πεσεῖται ὕψος ἀνθρώπων, **17**
καὶ ὑψωθήσεται Κύριος μόνος ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ. Καὶ **18**
τὰ χειροποίητα πάντα κατακρύψουσιν, εἰσενέγκαντες εἰς τὰ σπήλαια, **19**
καὶ εἰς τὰς σχισμὰς τῶν πετρῶν, καὶ εἰς τὰς τρώγλας
τῆς γῆς, ἀπὸ προσώπου τοῦ φόβου Κυρίου καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς δόξης τῆς
ἰσχύος αὐτοῦ, ὅταν ἀναστῇ θραῦσαι τὴν γῆν. Τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ **20**
ἐκβαλεῖ ἄνθρωπος τὰ βδελύγματα αὐτοῦ τὰ ἀργυρᾶ καὶ τὰ χρυσᾶ,
ἃ ἐποίησαν προσκυνεῖν τοῖς ματαίοις καὶ ταῖς νυκτερίσι, τοῦ εἰσελθεῖν **21**
εἰς τὰς τρώγλας τῆς στερεᾶς πέτρας, καὶ εἰς τὰς σχισμὰς
τῶν πετρῶν, ἀπὸ προσώπου τοῦ φόβου Κυρίου, καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς δόξης
τῆς ἰσχύος αὐτοῦ, ὅταν ἀναστῇ θραῦσαι τὴν γῆν. Παύσασθε ὑμῖν **22**
ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου, ᾧ ἀναπνοὴ ἐν μυκτῆρι αὐτοῦ· ὅτι ἐν τίνι ἐλογίσθη αὐτός;

ΚΕΦ. Γ΄. ΙΙΙ.

ΙΔΟΥ δὴ ὁ δεσπότης Κύριος Σαβαὼθ ἀφελεῖ ἀπὸ Ἱερουσαλήμ, **1**
καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς Ἰουδαίας ἰσχύοντα καὶ ἰσχύουσαν, ἰσχὺν ἄρτου **2**
καὶ ἰσχὺν ὕδατος, γίγαντα καὶ ἰσχύοντα, καὶ ἄνθρωπον πολεμιστὴν,
καὶ δικαστὴν, καὶ προφήτην, καὶ στοχαστὴν, καὶ πρεσβύτερον,
καὶ πεντηκόνταρχον, καὶ θαυμαστὸν σύμβουλον, καὶ σοφὸν **3**
ἀρχιτέκτονα, καὶ συνετὸν ἀκροατήν· καὶ ἐπιστήσω νεανίσκους ἄρχοντας **4**
αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐμπαῖκται κυριεύσουσιν αὐτῶν. Καὶ συμπεσεῖται **5**
ὁ λαὸς, ἄνθρωπος πρὸς ἄνθρωπον, καὶ ἄνθρωπος πρὸς τὸν
πλησίον αὐτοῦ· προσκόψει τὸ παιδίον πρὸς τὸν πρεσβύτην, ὁ ἄτιμος
πρὸς τὸν ἔντιμον. Ὅτι ἐπιλήψεται ἄνθρωπος τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ **6**
αὐτοῦ, ἢ τοῦ οἰκείου τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ, λέγων· ἱμάτιον ἔχεις, ἀρχηγὸς
ἡμῶν γενοῦ, καὶ τὸ βρῶμα τὸ ἐμὸν ὑπὸ σὲ ἔξω. Καὶ ἀποκριθεὶς **7**
ἐρεῖ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ· οὐκ ἔσομαι σοῦ ἀρχηγὸς, οὐ γὰρ
ἔστι ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ μου ἄρτος, οὐδὲ ἱμάτιον· οὐκ ἔσομαι ἀρχηγὸς τοῦ
λαοῦ τούτου. Ὅτι αἰνεῖται Ἱερουσαλὴμ, καὶ ἡ Ἰουδαία συμπέπτωκε, **8**
καὶ αἱ γλῶσσαι αὐτῶν μετὰ ἀνομίας, τὰ πρὸς κύριον ἀπειθοῦντες.
Διότι νῦν ἐταπεινώθη ἡ δόξα αὐτῶν, καὶ ἡ αἰσχύνη τοῦ
προσώπου αὐτῶν ἀντέστη αὐτοῖς· τὴν δὲ ἁμαρτίαν αὐτῶν ὡς Σοδόμων **9**

**15** And upon every high tower, and upon every lofty wall;
**16** And upon every ship of the sea, and upon every sight of comely ships.
**17** And every man shall be humbled, and the loftiness of men shall fall,
And the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.
**18** And all the works of their hands shall they wholly conceal,
**19** Bringing them into the caves, and into the clefts of the rocks,
And into the holes of the earth,
From the face of the fear of the Lord,
And from the glory of His might,
When He shall arise to shatter the earth.
**20** In that day shall a man cast forth his abominations of silver and of gold,
**21** Which they made to worship [to] the vain [idols] and to the bats;
And [he shall] enter into the holes of the solid rock,
And into the clefts of the rocks,
From the face of the fear of the Lord,
And from the glory of His might,
When He shall arise to shatter the earth.
**22** Cease ye for yourselves from the man,
In whose nostril is [but] breath;
For of what account was he reckoned?

### CHAPTER 3

**1** Behold now, the Lord God of Sabaoth shall take away from Jerusalem,
And from Judah,
**2** The strong man and the strong woman,
The strength of bread and the strength of water,
The giant and the mighty man, and the warrior,
And the judge, and the prophet, and the diviner, and the elder,
**3** And the captain of fifty, and the wondrous counselor,
And the cunning artificer, and the intelligent listener.
**4** And I will set youths to be their rulers,
And scoffers shall rule over them.
**5** And the people shall fall together,
Man against man, and man against his neighbor;
The child shall stumble against the elder,
And the dishonored against the honored.
**6** For a man shall lay hold of his brother,
Or of his father's household, saying:
"Thou hast a garment, be thou our leader,
And my food, my own, shall be made manifest beneath thee."
**7** And he shall answer in that day, saying:
"I will not be thy leader,
For there is neither bread in my house, nor a garment;
I will not be the leader of this people."
**8** For Jerusalem is lauded, and Judah hath fallen;
And their tongues [speak] with lawlessness,
Being disobedient unto the Lord.
**9** Therefore now is their glory humbled,
And the shame of their countenance hath risen up against them;
And they have declared their sin as Sodom's,
