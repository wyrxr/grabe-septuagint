ΚΕΦ. ΛΗʹ. ΛΘʹ. ΙΕΖΕΚΙΗΛ 1397
συναγωγὴ μεγάλῃ καὶ δύναμις πολλή, καὶ ἀναβήσῃ ἐπὶ τὸν λαόν 16
μου Ἰσραὴλ ὡς νεφέλη καλύψαι γῆν· ἐπ᾽ ἐσχάτων τῶν ἡμερῶν
ἔσται, καὶ ἀνάξω σε ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν μου, ἵνα γνῶσι πάντα τὰ ἔθνη
ἐμέ, ἐν τῷ ἁγιασθῆναί με ἐν σοὶ ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν. Τάδε λέγει 17
Ἀδωναὶ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τῷ Γώγ· σὺ εἶ, περὶ οὗ ἐλάλησα ἀφ᾽
ἡμερῶν τῶν ἔμπροσθεν, διὰ χειρὸς τῶν δούλων μου τῶν προ-
φητῶν τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις καὶ ἔτεσι τοῦ ἀ-
ναγαγεῖν σε ἐπ᾽ αὐτούς. Καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, ἐν ἡμέ- 18
ρᾳ ᾗ ἂν ἔλθῃ Γὼγ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, λέγει Κύριος Κύ-
ριος ὁ Θεός, ἀναβήσεται ὁ θυμός μου ἐν ὀργῇ μου, καὶ ὁ ζῆ- 19
λος μου ἐν πυρὶ τῆς ὀργῆς μου· ἐλάλησα, εἰ μὴν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ
ἐκείνῃ ἔσται σεισμὸς μέγας ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ σει- 20
σθήσονται ἀπὸ προσώπου τοῦ Κυρίου οἱ ἰχθύες τῆς θαλάσσης,
καὶ τὰ πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ τὰ θηρία τοῦ πεδίου, καὶ πάντα
τὰ ἑρπετὰ τὰ ἕρποντα ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, καὶ πάντες οἱ ἄνθρωποι οἱ
ἐπὶ προσώπου τῆς γῆς, καὶ ῥαγήσονται τὰ ὄρη, καὶ πεσοῦνται αἱ
φάραγγες, καὶ πᾶν τεῖχος ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν πεσεῖται, καὶ καλέσω 21
ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸ πᾶν φόβον μαχαίρας, λέγει Κύριος Κύριος· μάχαιρα
ἀνθρώπου ἐπὶ τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ ἔσται, καὶ κρινῶ αὐτὸν θανάτῳ, 22
καὶ αἵματι, καὶ ὑετῷ κατακλύζοντι, καὶ λίβοις χαλάζης, καὶ
πῦρ καὶ θεῖον βρέξω ἐπ᾽ αὐτόν, καὶ ἐπὶ πάντας τοὺς μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ,
καὶ ἐπὶ ἔθνη πολλὰ μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ μεγαλυνθήσομαι, καὶ ἁ- 23
γιασθήσομαι, καὶ ἐνδοξασθήσομαι, καὶ γνωσθήσομαι ἐναντίον ἐ-
θνῶν πολλῶν, καὶ γνώσονται ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι Κύριος.

ΚΕΦ. ΛΘʹ. XXXIX.

ΚΑΙ σὺ υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, προφήτευσον ἐπὶ Γώγ, καὶ εἰπὸν τάδε 1
λέγει Κύριος Κύριος· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐπὶ σὲ Γὼγ ἄρχοντα Ῥώς, Μοσόχ,
καὶ Θοβέλ, καὶ συνάξω σε, καὶ καθοδηγήσω σε, καὶ ἀναβιβάσω σε 2
ἀπ᾽ ἐσχάτου τοῦ βορρᾶ, καὶ συνάξω σε ἐπὶ τὰ ὄρη τοῦ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ 3
ἀπολῶ τὸ τόξον σου ἐκ τῆς χειρός σου τῆς ἀριστερᾶς, καὶ τὰ
τοξεύματά σου ἀπὸ τῆς χειρός σου τῆς δεξιᾶς, καὶ καταβαλῶ σε
ἐπὶ τὰ ὄρη τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ πεσῇ σὺ καὶ πάντες οἱ περὶ σέ, καὶ 4
τὰ ἔθνη τὰ μετὰ σοῦ δοθήσονταί εἰς πλῆθος ὀρνέων, παντὶ πε-
τεινῷ, καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς θηρίοις τοῦ πεδίου δέδωκά σε καταβρωθῆ-

16 ...assembly, great and a mighty power. And thou shalt come up against My people Israel as a cloud to cover the land. It shall be in the latter days, and I will bring thee upon My land, that all the nations may know Me, when I shall be hallowed in thee before their eyes.
17 Thus saith Adonai the Lord God to Gog: Art thou he of whom I spake in days of old, by the hand of My servants, the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in those days and in those years, that I would bring thee up against them?
18 And it shall come to pass in that day, in the day when Gog shall come upon the land of Israel, saith the Lord God, that My fury shall come up in My wrath, and My jealousy in the fire of My wrath.
19 I have spoken; surely, in that day there shall be a great earthquake upon the land of Israel.
20 And there shall tremble at the presence of the Lord the fish of the sea, and the birds of the heaven, and the beasts of the field, and all the creeping things that creep upon the earth, and all the men that are upon the face of the earth. And the mountains shall be rent asunder, and the valleys shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.
21 And I will call for every terror of the sword against him, saith the Lord God: every man's sword shall be against his brother.
22 And I will judge him with death and with blood, and with an overflowing rain, and with great hailstones; and fire and brimstone will I rain upon him, and upon all those that are with him, and upon many nations that are with him.
23 And I shall be magnified, and I shall be sanctified, and I shall be glorified, and I shall be known before many nations; and they shall know that I am the Lord.

### Chapter 39

1 And thou, son of man, prophesy thou against Gog, and say: "Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, ruler of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal;
2 and I will gather thee, and I will lead thee forth, and I will bring thee up from the uttermost parts of the north, and I will gather thee upon the mountains of Israel.
3 And I will destroy thy bow out of thy left hand, and thy arrows out of thy right hand, and I will cast thee down upon the mountains of Israel;
4 and thou shalt fall, thou and all them that are about thee, and the nations that are with thee shall be given unto a multitude of birds, to every winged fowl, and to all the beasts of the field have I given thee to be devoured."
