5 χαράκας καὶ προμαχῶνας, τοῦ μάχεσθαι πρὸς τοὺς Χαλδαίους,
καὶ πληρῶσαι αὐτὴν νεκρῶν τῶν ἀνθρώπων, οὓς ἐπάταξα ἐν
ὀργῇ μου, καὶ ἐν θυμῷ μου, καὶ ἀπέστρεψα τὸ πρόσωπόν μου
6 ἀπ’ αὐτῶν, περὶ πασῶν τῶν πονηριῶν αὐτῶν. Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐπάγω
ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς συνούλωσιν καὶ ἴαμα, καὶ ἰατρεύσω αὐτοὺς, καὶ φανε-
ρώσω αὐτοῖς εἰσακούειν (καὶ ἰατρεύσω αὐτοὺς, καὶ ποιήσω αὐτοῖς)
7 εἰρήνην καὶ πίστιν· καὶ ἀποστρέψω τὴν ἀποικίαν Ἰούδα, καὶ τὴν
8 ἀποικίαν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ οἰκοδομήσω αὐτοὺς ὡς τὸ πρότερον· καὶ
καθαριῶ αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ πασῶν τῶν ἀδικιῶν αὐτῶν, ὧν ἥμαρτόν μοι,
καὶ οὐ μὴ μνησθήσομαι ἁμαρτιῶν αὐτῶν ὧν ἥμαρτόν μοι, καὶ
9 ἀπέστησαν ἀπ’ ἐμοῦ. Καὶ ἔσται εἰς ὄνομα εὐφροσύνης καὶ εἰς αἴ-
νεσιν, καὶ εἰς μεγαλειότητα παντὶ τῷ λαῷ τῆς γῆς, οἵτινες ἀκού-
σονται πάντα τὰ ἀγαθὰ, ἃ ἐγὼ ποιῶ αὐτοῖς, καὶ φοβηθήσονται,
καὶ πικρανθήσονται περὶ πάντων τῶν ἀγαθῶν, καὶ περὶ πάσης
10 τῆς εἰρήνης, ἧς ἐγὼ ποιῶ αὐτοῖς. Οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος· ἔτι
ἀκουσθήσεται ἐν τῷ τόπῳ τούτῳ, ᾧ ὑμεῖς λέγετε, ἔρημός ἐστιν
ἀπὸ ἀνθρώπων καὶ κτηνῶν, ἐν πόλεσιν Ἰούδα, καὶ ἔξωθεν Ἱερου-
σαλήμ, ταῖς ἠρημωμέναις, (καὶ) παρὰ τὸ μὴ εἶναι ἄνθρωπον
11 καὶ παρὰ τὸ μὴ εἶναι οἰκοῦντα καὶ κτήνη, φωνὴ χαρμονῆς, καὶ
φωνὴ χαρμονῆς, φωνὴ νυμφίου, καὶ φωνὴ νύμφης, φωνὴ λεγόντων·
ἐξομολογεῖσθε Κυρίῳ παντοκράτορι, ὅτι χρηστὸς Κύριος, ὅτι εἰς
τὸν αἰῶνα τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ· καὶ εἰσοίσουσι δῶρα αἰνέσεως εἰς οἶκον
Κυρίου, ὅτι ἀποστρέψω τὴν ἀποικίαν πάσης τῆς γῆς ἐκείνης
12 καθὰ πρότερον, εἶπε Κύριος. Οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος τῶν δυνάμεων·
ἔτι ἔσται ἐν τῷ τόπῳ τῷ ἠρημωμένῳ τούτῳ, παρὰ τὸ μὴ εἶναι
ἄνθρωπον καὶ κτήνη, καὶ ἐν πάσαις ταῖς πόλεσιν αὐτοῦ, καταλύ-
13 ματα ποιμένων κοιταζόντων πρόβατα. Ἐν πόλεσι τῆς ὀρεινῆς,
καὶ ἐν πόλεσι τῆς Σεφηλὰ, καὶ ἐν πόλεσι τῆς Ναγὲβ, καὶ ἐν γῇ
Βενιαμείν, καὶ ἐν κύκλῳ Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἐν πόλεσιν Ἰούδα, ἔτι
14 παρελεύσεται πρόβατα ἐπὶ χεῖρα ἀριθμοῦντος, εἶπε Κύριος. Ἰδοὺ
ἡμέραι ἔρχονται, φησὶ Κύριος, καὶ ἀναστήσω τὸν λόγον μου τὸν
ἀγαθὸν, ὃν ἐλάλησα ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκόν μου Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον
15 Ἰούδα. Ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις καὶ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ ἀνατελῶ
τῷ Δαβὶδ ἀνατολὴν δικαίαν, καὶ ποιήσει κρίμα καὶ δικαιοσύνην
16 ἐν τῇ γῇ. Ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις σωθήσεται Ἰούδα, καὶ Ἱερου-
σαλὴμ κατασκηνώσει πεποιθῦια· καὶ τοῦτο τὸ ὄνομα ᾧ κληθή-

**JEREMIAH 33**

**5** ...[trenches] and bulwarks, to fight against the Chaldeans, and to fill it with the dead bodies of men, whom I have struck down in My wrath, and in My fury, and from whom I have turned away My face, concerning all their wickednesses.
**6** Behold, I will bring upon them soundness and healing; and I will heal them, and I will make manifest unto them [My] hearkening [unto them] (yea, I will heal them, and I will make unto them) peace and faithfulness.
**7** And I will restore the captivity of Judah, and the captivity of Israel, and I will build them up as in the former time.
**8** And I will cleanse them from all their iniquities, wherein they have sinned against Me; and I will by no means remember their sins wherein they have sinned against Me and have departed from Me.
**9** And it shall be unto Me a name of joy, and a praise, and a great glory unto all the people of the earth, who shall hear all the good things which I do for them; and they shall fear, and they shall be deeply grieved, for all the good and for all the peace which I make for them.
**10** Thus saith the Lord: Yet again shall there be heard in this place, of which ye say, "It is desolate, without man and beast," in the cities of Judah, and without Jerusalem, even in those which are laid waste, (and) because there is no man dwelling therein, and no beast: the voice of joy, and the voice of joy,
**11** The voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that say, "Give thanks unto the Lord Almighty, for the Lord is good, for His mercy endureth forever!" And they shall bring gifts of praise into the house of the Lord; for I will restore the captivity of all that land as in the former time, saith the Lord.
**12** Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Yet again shall there be in this desolate place, because there is no man and no beast, and in all its cities, dwelling-places for shepherds causing their sheep to lie down.
**13** In the cities of the hill country, and in the cities of the Shephelah, and in the cities of the Negeb, and in the land of Benjamin, and round about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the sheep yet pass under the hand of him that counteth them, saith the Lord.
**14** Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will perform My good word which I have spoken concerning My house of Israel, and concerning the house of Judah.
**15** In those days, and at that time, will I cause to spring forth unto David a righteous Branch; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land.
**16** In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell in safety; and this is the name whereby she shall be called:
