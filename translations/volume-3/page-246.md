ἀπόκλειψα ὡς νεφέλην τὰς ἀνομίας σου, καὶ ὡς γνόφον τὰς ἁ-
**23** μαρτίας σου· ἐπιστράφηθι πρὸς με, καὶ λυτρώσομαί σε. Εὐ-
φράνθητε οὐρανοί, ὅτι ἠλέησεν ὁ Θεὸς τὸν Ἰσραήλ· σαλπίσατε
θεμέλια τῆς γῆς, βοήσατε ὄρη εὐφροσύνην, οἱ βουνοὶ καὶ πάντα
τὰ ξύλα τὰ ἐν αὐτοῖς, ὅτι ἐλυτρώσατο ὁ Θεὸς τὸν Ἰακὼβ, καὶ
**24** Ἰσραὴλ δοξασθήσεται. Οὕτως λέγει Κύριος ὁ λυτρούμενός σε,
καὶ πλάσσων σε ἐκ κοιλίας· ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ συντελῶν πάντα, ἐξέ-
**25** τεινα τὸν οὐρανὸν μόνος, καὶ ἐστερέωσα τὴν γῆν. Τίς ἕτερος
διασκεδάσει σημεῖα ἐγγαστριμύθων, καὶ μαντείας ἀπὸ καρδίας,
ἀποστρέφων φρονίμους εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω, καὶ τὴν βουλὴν αὐτῶν
**26** μωραίνων, καὶ ἱστῶν ῥήματα παίδων αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὴν βουλὴν
τῶν ἀγγέλων αὐτοῦ ἀληθεύων· ὁ λέγων τῇ Ἱερουσαλὴμ, κα-
τοικηθήσῃ, καὶ ταῖς πόλεσι τῆς Ἰουδαίας, οἰκοδομηθήσεσθε, καὶ
**27** τὰ ἔρημα αὐτοῖς ἀνατελεῖ. Ὁ λέγων τῇ ἀβύσσῳ, ἐρημωθήσῃ,
**28** καὶ τοὺς ποταμούς σου ξηρανῶ. Ὁ λέγων Κύρῳ φρονεῖν, καὶ
πάντα τὰ θελήματά μου ποιήσει· ὁ λέγων Ἱερουσαλὴμ, οἰκο-
δομηθήσῃ, καὶ τὸν οἶκον τὸν ἅγιόν μου θεμελιώσω.

**1** Οὕτως λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τῷ χριστῷ μου Κύρῳ, οὗ
ἐκράτησα τῆς δεξιᾶς, ἐπακοῦσαι ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ ἔθνη, καὶ ἰσ-
χὺν βασιλέων διαῤῥήξω, ἀνοίξω ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ θύρας, καὶ πό-
**2** λεις οὐ συγκλεισθήσονται. Ἐγὼ ἔμπροσθέν σου πορεύσομαι, καὶ
ὄρη ὁμαλιῶ, θύρας χαλκᾶς συντρίψω, καὶ μοχλοὺς σιδηροῦς συγ-
**3** κλάσω, καὶ δώσω σοι θησαυροὺς σκοτεινοὺς ἀποκρύφους, ἀορά-
τους ἀνοίξω σοι, ἵνα γνώσῃ, ὅτι ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὁ καλῶν
**4** τὸ ὄνομά σου Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ. Ἕνεκεν Ἰακὼβ τοῦ παιδός μου, καὶ
Ἰσραὴλ τοῦ ἐκλεκτοῦ μου, ἐγὼ καλέσω σε τῷ ὀνόματί σου, καὶ
**5** προσδέξομαί σε· σὺ δὲ οὐκ ἔγνως με, ὅτι ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς,
καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἔτι πλὴν ἐμοῦ Θεός· ἐνίσχυσά σε, καὶ οὐκ ᾔδεις
**6** με, ἵνα γνῶσιν οἱ ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν ἡλίου καὶ οἱ ἀπὸ δυσμῶν αὐ-
τοῦ, ὅτι οὐκ ἔστι πλὴν ἐμοῦ· καὶ ὅτι ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς,
**7** καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἔτι. Ἐγὼ ὁ κατασκευάσας φῶς, καὶ ποιήσας σκό-
τος, ὁ ποιῶν εἰρήνην, καὶ κτίζων κακά· ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς
**8** ὁ ποιῶν ταῦτα πάντα. Εὐφρανθήτω ὁ οὐρανὸς ἄνωθεν, καὶ αἱ
νεφέλαι ῥανάτωσαν δικαιοσύνην· ἀνατειλάτω ἡ γῆ, καὶ βλαστησάτω

#### Chapter 44

**22** I have blotted out, as a cloud, thy transgressions,
    and, as a thick darkness, thy sins.
    Turn thou unto Me, and I will redeem thee.
**23** Rejoice, ye heavens, for God hath shown mercy to Israel!
    Sound forth, O foundations of the earth!
    Cry out, ye mountains, with exultation,
    and ye hills, and all the trees that are in them;
    for God hath redeemed Jacob,
    and Israel shall be glorified.
**24** Thus saith the Lord, He that redeemeth thee,
    and He that fashioneth thee from the womb:
    "I am the Lord, who accomplisheth all things;
    I stretched out the heaven alone,
    and I established the earth.
**25** Who else shall scatter the signs of those who divine by familiar spirits,
    and divinations from their [own] heart,
    turning wise men backward,
    and making their counsel foolish;
**26** and establishing the words of His servants,
    and making true the counsel of His messengers;
    He that saith unto Jerusalem, 'Thou shalt be inhabited,'
    and unto the cities of Judah, 'Ye shall be built,'
    and to their desolate places, 'I shall cause them to arise.'
**27** He that saith to the deep, 'Be thou made desolate,'
    and, 'Thy rivers I shall dry up.'
**28** He that saith to Cyrus, 'Be thou prudent,'
    and, 'All My will shall he perform.'
    He that saith to Jerusalem, 'Thou shalt be built,'
    and, 'My holy house I shall found.'"

#### Chapter 45

**1** Thus saith the Lord God to My Anointed, to Cyrus,
    whose right hand I have held,
    that nations may hearken before him;
    and I will break asunder the strength of kings;
    I will open doors before him,
    and cities shall not be closed.
**2** I Myself shall go before thee,
    and I will make the mountains level;
    bronze doors I shall shatter,
    and iron bars I shall break in pieces.
**3** And I will give unto thee treasures dark [and] hidden,
    [even treasures] invisible will I open unto thee,
    that thou mayest know that I am the Lord God,
    He that calleth thy name, the God of Israel.
**4** For the sake of Jacob My servant,
    and Israel My chosen one,
    I shall call thee by thy name,
    and I shall accept thee.
**5** Yet thou hast not known Me,
    that I am the Lord God,
    and there is no other God save Me.
    I have strengthened thee, though thou didst not know Me,
**6** that they may know, from the rising of the sun even unto its setting,
    that there is none beside Me;
    and that I am the Lord God,
**7** and there is none other.
    I am He that hath fashioned light, and made darkness;
    He that maketh peace, and appointeth calamities.
    I am the Lord God, He that doeth all these things.
**8** Let the heaven rejoice from above,
    and let the clouds sprinkle righteousness;
    let the earth bring forth, and let it sprout forth.
