διότι ἔγνωκα ἐγώ, ὅτι δι᾿ ἐμὲ ὁ κλύδων ὁ μέγας οὗτος ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς ἐστι.
**13** Καὶ παρεβιάζοντο οἱ ἄνδρες τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι πρὸς τὴν γῆν, καὶ οὐκ ἐδύναντο, ὅτι ἡ θάλασσα ἐπορεύετο, καὶ ἐξηγείρετο μᾶλλον ἐπ᾿ αὐτούς.
**14** Καὶ ἀνεβόησαν πρὸς Κύριον, καὶ εἶπαν· μηδαμῶς Κύριε, μὴ ἀπολώμεθα ἕνεκεν τῆς ψυχῆς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τούτου, καὶ μὴ δῷς ἐφ᾿ ἡμᾶς αἷμα δίκαιον, ὅτι σὺ Κύριε, ὃν τρόπον ἐβούλου, πεποίηκας.
**15** Καὶ ἔλαβον τὸν Ἰωνᾶν, καὶ ἐνέβαλον αὐτὸν εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν, καὶ ἔστη ἡ θάλασσα ἐκ τοῦ σάλου ἑαυτῆς.
**16** Καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν οἱ ἄνδρες φόβῳ μεγάλῳ τὸν Κύριον, καὶ ἔδυσαν θυσίαν τῷ Κυρίῳ, καὶ ηὔξαντο εὐχάς.

ΚΕΦ. Β´. ΙΙ.

**1** ΚΑΙ προσέταξε Κύριος κήτει μεγάλῳ καταπιεῖν τὸν Ἰωνᾶν· καὶ ἦν Ἰωνᾶς ἐν τῇ κοιλίᾳ τοῦ κήτους τρεῖς ἡμέρας καὶ τρεῖς νύκτας.
**2** Καὶ προσηύξατο Ἰωνᾶς πρὸς Κύριον τὸν Θεὸν αὐτοῦ ἐκ τῆς κοιλίας τοῦ κήτους, καὶ εἶπεν· (ᾠδὴ) ἐβόησα ἐν θλίψει μου πρὸς Κύριον τὸν Θεόν μου, καὶ εἰσήκουσέ μου· ἐκ κοιλίας ἅδου κραυγῆς μου, ἤκουσας φωνῆς μου·
**4** ἀπέρριψάς με εἰς βάθη καρδίας θαλάσσης, καὶ ποταμοί με ἐκύκλωσαν· πάντες οἱ μετεωρισμοί σου καὶ τὰ κύματά σου ἐπ᾿ ἐμὲ διῆλθον.
**5** Κἀγὼ εἶπα· ἀπώσμαι ἐξ ὀφθαλμῶν σου· ἄρα προσθήσω τοῦ ἐπιβλέψαι πρὸς ναὸν τὸν ἅγιόν σου.
**6** Περιεχύθη μοι ὕδωρ ἕως ψυχῆς, ἄβυσσος ἐκύκλωσέ με ἐσχάτη, ἔδυ ἡ κεφαλή μου εἰς σχισμὰς ὀρέων·
**7** κατέβην εἰς γῆν, ἧς οἱ μοχλοὶ αὐτῆς κάτοχοι αἰώνιοι· καὶ ἀναβήτω ἐκ φθορᾶς ἡ ζωή μου, Κύριε ὁ Θεός μου.
**8** Ἐν τῷ ἐκλείπειν τὴν ψυχήν μου ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ, τοῦ Κυρίου ἐμνήσθην, καὶ ἔλθοι πρὸς σὲ ἡ προσευχή μου εἰς ναὸν ἅγιόν σου.
**9** Φυλασσόμενοι μάταια καὶ ψευδῆ ἔλεος αὐτῶν ἐγκατέλιπον.
**10** Ἐγὼ δὲ μετὰ φωνῆς αἰνέσεως καὶ ἐξομολογήσεως θύσω σοι, ὅσα ηὐξάμην ἀποδώσω· (εἰς) σωτηρίαν (μου) τῷ Κυρίῳ.
**11** Καὶ προσέταγη ἀπὸ Κυρίου τῷ κήτει, καὶ ἐξέβαλε τὸν Ἰωνᾶν ἐπὶ τὴν ξηράν.

ΚΕΦ. Γ´. ΙΙΙ.

**1** ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς Ἰωνᾶν ἐκ δευτέρου, λέγων·
**2** ἀνάστηθι καὶ πορεύθητι εἰς Νινευὴ τὴν πόλιν τὴν μεγάλην, καὶ

JONAH
CHAPTER I

...for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.

**13** Then the men did strive to return unto the land, but they could not, for the sea wrought, and was yet more tempestuous upon them.

**14** And they cried unto the LORD, and said, "We beseech Thee, O LORD, let us not perish for the sake of this man's life, and lay not upon us righteous blood; for Thou, O LORD, as Thou hast willed, so hast Thou done."

**15** So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea; and the sea ceased from her raging.

**16** Then the men feared the LORD with a great fear, and they offered sacrifice unto the LORD, and made vows.

CHAPTER II

**1** Now the LORD had commanded a great sea-monster to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the sea-monster three days and three nights.

**2** And Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the belly of the sea-monster, and said: (A Song) "I cried out in my distress unto the LORD my God, and He heard me. From the belly of Hades came my cry, and Thou didst hear my voice.

**4** Thou hadst cast me forth into the depths, into the heart of the sea, and the rivers did compass me about; all Thy billows and Thy waves passed over me.

**5** Then I said, 'I am cast out of Thy sight'; yet shall I look again toward Thy holy temple.

**6** The waters compassed me about, even to my soul; the deepest abyss did encompass me, and my head did sink into the clefts of the mountains.

**7** I went down to the land, whose bars were everlasting keepers; yet may my life ascend from corruption, O LORD my God.

**8** When my soul did faint within me, I remembered the LORD; and may my prayer come in unto Thee, into Thy holy temple.

**9** They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.

**10** But I, with the voice of praise and confession, will sacrifice unto Thee; whatsoever I have vowed, I will pay. [For] salvation [is] of the Lord.

**11** And a command was given from the Lord unto the sea-monster, and it did cast forth Jonah upon the dry land.

CHAPTER III

**1** And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time, saying:

**2** "Arise, and go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach...
