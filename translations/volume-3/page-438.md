28 διὰ θαλάσσης· ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῆς πτώσεώς σου πρὸς τὴν φωνὴν
29 τῆς κραυγῆς σου οἱ κυβερνῆταί σου φόβῳ φοβηθήσονται. Καὶ
    καταβήσονται ἀπὸ τῶν πλοίων αὐτῶν πάντες οἱ κωπηλάταί σου
    καὶ οἱ ἐπιβάται, καὶ οἱ πωρεῖς τῆς θαλάσσης ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν στήσον-
30 ται, καὶ ἀλαλάξουσιν ἐπὶ σὲ τῇ φωνῇ αὐτῶν, καὶ κεκράξονται
    πικρόν, καὶ ἐπιθήσουσιν ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτῶν γῆν, καὶ σποδὸν
31 ὑποστρώσονται. Καὶ φαλακρώσουσιν ἐπὶ σὲ φαλάκρωμα, καὶ περι-
    ζώσονται σάκκον, καὶ κλαύσονται περὶ σοῦ ἐν πικρασμῷ ψυχῆς,
32 καὶ κοπετὸν πικρόν (ἐκστήσονται.) Καὶ λήψονται οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτῶν
    ἐπὶ σὲ θρῆνον, καὶ θρήνημα ἐπὶ σοί. Τίς ὥσπερ Τύρος κατασιγη-
33 θεῖσα ἐν μέσῳ θαλάσσης· πόσον καὶ τίνα εὗρες μισθὸν ἀπὸ τῆς
    θαλάσσης; ἐνέπλησας ἔθνη ἀπὸ τοῦ πλήθους σου, καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ
    πλήθους τοῦ συμμίκτου σου ἐπλούτισας πάντας τοὺς βασιλεῖς τῆς
34 γῆς. Νῦν συνετρίβης ἐν θαλάσσῃ, ἐν βάθει ὕδατος ὁ σύμμικτός σου,
35 καὶ πᾶσα ἡ συναγωγή σου ἐν μέσῳ σου. Ἔπεσον πάντες οἱ κατοι-
    κοῦντες τὰς νήσους, καὶ οἱ κωπηλάταί σου ἐστύγνασαν ἐπὶ σέ, καὶ
    οἱ βασιλεῖς αὐτῶν ἐκστάσει ἐξέστησαν, καὶ ἐδάκρυσαν τῷ προ-
36 σώπῳ αὐτῶν ἐπὶ σοί. Ἔμποροι ἀπὸ ἐθνῶν ἐσύρισάν σε, ἀπώλεια
    ἐγένου, καὶ οὐκέτι ἔσῃ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεός.
    ΚΕΦ ΚΗ΄. XXVIII.
1.2 ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς μέ, λέγων· υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου,
    εἰπὸν τῷ ἄρχοντι Τύρου· τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεός· ἀνθ᾿ ὧν ὑ-
    ψώθη σου ἡ καρδία, καὶ εἶπας· Θεός εἰμι ἐγώ, κατοικίαν Θεοῦ κα-
    τώκησα ἐν καρδίᾳ θαλάσσης, σὺ δὲ εἶ ἄνθρωπος καὶ οὐ Θεός, καὶ
3   ἔδωκας τὴν καρδίαν σου ὡς καρδίαν Θεοῦ, μὴ σοφώτερος εἶ σὺ
    τοῦ Δανιήλ; (ἢ) σοφοὶ οὐκ ἐπαιδεύσαν σὲ ἐν τῇ ἐπιστήμῃ αὐτῶν;
4   Μὴ ἐν τῇ ἐπιστήμῃ σου ἢ ἐν τῇ φρονήσει σου ἐποίησας σεαυτῷ
    δύναμιν, καὶ ἐποίησας χρυσίον καὶ ἀργύριον ἐν τοῖς θησαυροῖς
5   σου; Ἢ ἐν τῇ πολλῇ ἐπιστήμῃ σου καὶ ἐμπορίᾳ σου ἐπλήθυνας
    δύναμίν σου, ὑψώθη ἡ καρδία σου ἐν τῇ δυνάμει σου. Διὰ τοῦτο
6   τάδε λέγει Κύριος Κύριος ὁ Θεός· ἀνθ᾿ ὧν ἔδωκας τὴν καρδίαν
7   σου ὡς καρδίαν Θεοῦ, ἀντὶ τούτου ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐπάγω ἐπὶ σὲ ἀλ-
    λοτρίους λοιμοὺς ἀπὸ ἐθνῶν, καὶ ἐκκενώσουσι τὰς μαχαίρας αὐ-
    τῶν ἐπὶ σέ, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸ κάλλος τῆς ἐπιστήμης σου, καὶ στρώσουσι
8   τὸ κάλλος σου εἰς ἀπώλειαν, καὶ καταβιβάσουσί σε, καὶ ἀποθανῇ

**Chapter 27**

<p><sup>28</sup> through the sea. In the day of thy fall, at the sound of thy cry,
<sup>29</sup> thy shipmasters shall be sore afraid. And all thy rowers
and the passengers, and the merchants of the sea shall come down from their ships,
and shall stand upon the land;
<sup>30</sup> and they shall wail over thee with their voice, and they shall cry bitterly,
and they shall cast earth upon their heads, and upon ashes shall they spread themselves.
<sup>31</sup> And they shall make themselves bald for thee, even a baldness,
and they shall gird themselves with sackcloth, and they shall weep for thee
in bitterness of soul,
<sup>32</sup> yea, a bitter lamentation shall they utter. And their sons shall take up for thee
a lamentation, and a dirge for thee. Who is like Tyre, silenced
in the midst of the sea?
<sup>33</sup> How great and what recompense didst thou find from the sea?
Thou didst fill nations from thy multitude, and from the multitude
of thy mingled [people] didst thou enrich all the kings of the earth.
<sup>34</sup> Now art thou broken in the sea, in the depth of the waters, [even] thy mingled [host],
<sup>35</sup> and all thy congregation in thy midst. All the inhabitants
of the islands are fallen, and thy rowers are dismayed at thee,
and their kings are utterly astonished with terror, and they have wept
with their countenances over thee.
<sup>36</sup> Merchants from among the nations have hissed at thee; thou art become a desolation,
and thou shalt be no more for ever, saith the Lord God.</p>

**Chapter 28**

<p><sup>1-2</sup> Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man,
speak unto the prince of Tyre, Thus saith the Lord God: Because thine heart
is lifted up, and thou hast said, I am a god, I have dwelt
in the habitation of God in the heart of the sea; yet thou art a man,
and not God, and
<sup>3</sup> thou hast set thine heart as the heart of God: art thou wiser than Daniel?
(Or) have wise men not instructed thee in their knowledge?
<sup>4</sup> Is it by thy knowledge, or by thy understanding, that thou hast made for thyself
might, and hast made gold and silver in thy treasures?
<sup>5</sup> Or by thy great knowledge and by thy commerce hast thou multiplied
thy might, [so that] thine heart is lifted up because of thy might?
<sup>6</sup> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: Because thou hast set thine heart
<sup>7</sup> as the heart of God, for this, behold, I will bring upon thee
strangers, [even] plagues from the nations; and they shall draw out their swords
upon thee, and upon the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall lay low
<sup>8</sup> thy beauty unto perdition, and they shall cast thee down, and thou shalt die</p>
