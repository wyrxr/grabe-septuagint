ΚΕΦ. Θʹ. IX.

ΛΗΜΜΑ λόγου Κυρίου ἐν γῇ Σεδράχ, καὶ Δαμασκοῦ θυσίας αὐτοῦ, 1
διότι Κύριος ἐφορᾷ ἀνθρώπους, καὶ πάσας φυλὰς τοῦ Ἰσραήλ.
Καὶ Ἡμὰθ ἐν τοῖς ὁρίοις αὐτῆς, Τύρος καὶ Σιδῶν, διότι ἐφρόνησαν 2
σφόδρα· καὶ ᾠκοδόμησε Τύρος ὀχυρώματα ἑαυτῇ, καὶ ἐθησαύρισεν 3
ἀργύριον ὡς χοῦν, καὶ συνήγαγε χρυσίον ὡς πηλὸν ὁδῶν. Διὰ 4
τοῦτο Κύριος κληρονομήσει αὐτήν, καὶ πατάξει εἰς θάλασσαν τὴν
δύναμιν αὐτῆς, καὶ αὕτη ἐν πυρὶ καταναλωθήσεται.
5 θήσεται. Ὄψεται Ἀσκάλων, καὶ φοβηθήσεται, καὶ Γάζα, καὶ ὀδυνηθήσεται σφόδρα, καὶ Ἀκκάρων, ἔτι ἠσχύνθη τῆς ἐλπίδος αὐτῆς· καὶ ἀπολεῖται βασιλεὺς ἀπὸ Γάζης, καὶ Ἀσκάλων οὐ μὴ 6 κατοικηθῇ. Καὶ κατοικήσουσιν ἀλλογενεῖς ἐν Ἀζώτῳ, καὶ καθελῶ ὕβριν ἀλλοφύλων· 7 καὶ ἐξαρῶ τὸ αἷμα αὐτῶν ἐκ στόματος αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰ βδελύγματα αὐτῶν ἐκ μέσου ὀδόντων αὐτῶν, καὶ ὑπολειφθήσονται καὶ οὗτοι τῷ Θεῷ ἡμῶν, καὶ ἔσονται ὡς χιλίαρχος ἐν Ἰούδᾳ, καὶ Ἀκκάρων ὡς ὁ Ἰεβουσαῖος. 8 Καὶ ὑποστήσομαι τῷ οἴκῳ μου ἀνάστημα, τοῦ μὴ διαπορεύεσθαι, μηδὲ ἀνακάμπτειν, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἐπέλθῃ ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς οὐκέτι ἐξελαύνων· διότι 9 νῦν ἑώρακα ἐν τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς μου. Χαῖρε σφόδρα, θύγατερ Σιὼν, κήρυσσε, θύγατερ Ἱερουσαλήμ· ἰδοὺ ὁ βασιλεύς σου ἔρχεταί σοι δίκαιος καὶ σώζων, αὐτὸς πραῢς καὶ ἐπιβεβηκὼς ἐπὶ ὑποζύγιον 10 καὶ πῶλον νέον. Καὶ ἐξολοθρεύσει ἅρματα ἐξ Ἐφραίμ, καὶ ἵππον ἐξ Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἐξολοθρευθήσεται τόξον πολεμικόν, καὶ πλῆθος καὶ εἰρήνη ἐξ ἐθνῶν· καὶ καταρξει ὑδάτων ἕως θαλάσσης, καὶ ποταμῶν δι’ ἐκβολὰς γῆς. 11 Καὶ σὺ ἐν αἵματι διαθήκης σου ἐξαπέστειλας τοὺς δεσμίους σου ἐκ λάκκου οὐκ ἔχοντος ὕδωρ· 12 καθήσεσθε ἐν ὀχυρώματι δέσμιοι τῆς συναγωγῆς, καὶ ἀντὶ μιᾶς ἡμέρας παροικεσίας σου διπλᾶ ἀνταποδώσω σοι. 13 Διότι ἐνέτεινά σε, Ἰούδα, ἐμαυτῷ εἰς τόξον, ἔπλησα τὸν Ἐφραίμ, καὶ ἐπεγειρῶ τὰ τέκνα σου, Σιὼν, ἐπὶ τὰ τέκνα τῶν Ἑλλήνων, καὶ ψηλαφήσω 14 σε ὡς ρομφαίαν μαχητοῦ. Καὶ ἔσται Κύριος ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς, καὶ ἐξελεύσεται ὡς ἀστραπὴ βολίς· καὶ Κύριος παντοκράτωρ ἐν σάλπιγγι σαλπιεῖ, καὶ πορεύσεται ἐν σάλῳ ἀπειλῆς αὐτοῦ. 15 Κύριος παντοκράτωρ ὑπερασπιεῖ αὐτῶν, καὶ καταναλώσουσιν αὐτοὺς, καὶ καταχώσουσιν αὐτοὺς ἐν λίθοις σφενδόνης, καὶ ἐκπίοονται τὸ αἷμα αὐτῶν ὡς οἶνον, καὶ πλήσουσιν ὡς φιάλας θυσιαστήριον. 16 Καὶ σώσει αὐτοὺς Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς αὐτῶν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, ὡς πρόβατα λαὸν αὐτοῦ· διότι λίθοι ἅγιοι κυλίονται ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς αὐτοῦ. 17 Ὅτι εἴ τι ἀγαθὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἴ τι καλὸν παρ’ αὐτοῦ, σῖτος νεανίσκοις, καὶ οἶνος εὐωδιάζων εἰς παρθένους.

ΚΕΦ. Ι΄. Χ.

1 ΑΙΤΕΙΣΘΕ ὑετὸν παρὰ Κυρίου καθ’ ὥραν πρώϊμον καὶ ὄψιμον· Κύριος ἐποίησε φαντασίας, καὶ ὑετὸν χειμερινὸν δώσει αὐ-

**Zechariah [Chapter] 9**

**5** Ashkelon shall see [it], and be afraid; Gaza also, and shall be sorely pained; and Ekron, for her expectation shall be put to shame. And a king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall no more be inhabited.
**6** And strangers shall dwell in Ashdod, and I shall cut off the insolence of the Philistines.
**7** And I shall take away their blood from their mouth, and their abominations from between their teeth; and these also shall be left unto our God, and they shall be as a chief in Judah, and Ekron as the Jebusite.
**8** And I shall set up a bulwark for My house, that none may pass through, nor turn back; and no oppressor shall come upon them any more, for now have I seen [it] with Mine own eyes.
**9** Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; proclaim, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee; He is righteous and bringing salvation, Himself meek, and riding upon a beast of burden and a young colt.
**10** And He shall utterly destroy chariots from Ephraim, and horses from Jerusalem; and the bow of war shall be utterly destroyed, and a multitude, even peace, [shall come forth] from the nations. And He shall pour out waters unto the sea, and from the rivers through the ends of the earth.
**11** And thou, by the blood of thy covenant, hast sent forth thy prisoners from the pit wherein is no water.
**12** Ye shall sit in the stronghold, ye prisoners of the congregation; and for one day of your sojourning, I will restore unto thee double.
**13** For I have bent thee, O Judah, for Myself as a bow; I have filled [the quiver with] Ephraim, and I will rouse up thy children, O Zion, against the children of the Greeks, and I will wield thee as a warrior’s sword.
**14** And the Lord shall be over them, and His dart shall go forth as the lightning; and the Lord Almighty shall sound the trumpet, and shall go forth in the commotion of His threat.
**15** The Lord Almighty shall defend them; and they shall consume their foes, and shall bury them with sling stones; and they shall drink their blood as wine, and they shall fill the altar as bowls.
**16** And the Lord their God shall save them in that day, [even] His people as sheep; for holy stones do roll upon His land.
**17** For how great is His goodness, and how great is His beauty from Him? [He shall provide] grain for young men, and fragrant wine for virgins.

**Zechariah [Chapter] 10**

**1** Ask ye of the Lord rain in its season, both early and late; the Lord hath wrought manifestations, and He shall give them winter rain,
