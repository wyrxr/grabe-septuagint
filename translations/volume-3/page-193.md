ΚΕΦ. ϛʹ. Η Σ Α Ι Α Σ. 1131
ἐθυμώθη ὀργὴ Κυρίου Σαβαὼθ εἰς τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπέβαλε
τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς, καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτούς· καὶ παρωξύνθη
τὰ ὄρη, καὶ ἐγεννήθη τὰ θνησιμαῖα αὐτῶν ὡς κοπρία ἐν μέσῳ
ὁδοῦ. Ἐν πᾶσι τούτοις οὐκ ἀπεστράφη ὁ θυμὸς αὐτοῦ, ἀλλ᾿ ἔτι
ἡ χεὶρ ὑψηλή. Τοιγαροῦν ἀρεῖ σύσσημον ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι τοῖς 26
μακράν, καὶ συριεῖ αὐτοῖς ἀπ᾿ ἄκρου τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἰδοὺ ταχὺ
κούφως ἔρχονται· οὐ πεινάουσιν, οὐδὲ κοπιάσουσιν, οὐδὲ νυστά- 27
ξουσιν, οὐδὲ κοιμηθήσονται, οὐδὲ οὐ μὴ λύσουσι τὰς ζώνας αὐ-
τῶν ἀπὸ τῆς ὀσφύος αὐτῶν, οὐδὲ μὴ ῥαγῶσιν οἱ ἱμάντες τῶν
ὑποδημάτων αὐτῶν· ὧν τὰ βέλη ὀξέα ἐστι, καὶ τὰ τόξα αὐτῶν 28
ἐντεταμένα· αἱ ὅπλαὶ τῶν ἵππων αὐτῶν ὡς στερεὰ πέτρα ἐλο-
γίσθησαν, οἱ τροχοὶ τῶν ἁρμάτων αὐτῶν, ὡς καταιγίς. Ὀργιῶσιν ὡς 29
λέοντες, καὶ παρεστήκασιν ὡς σκύμνοι λέοντος· καὶ ἐπιλήψεται,
καὶ βοήσεται ὡς θηρίον, καὶ ἐκβαλεῖ, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ὁ ῥυόμενος, καὶ 30
βοήσεται δὲ αὐτοὺς ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ὡς φωνὴ θαλάσσης κυ-
μαινούσης· καὶ ἐμβλέψονται εἰς τὴν γῆν, καὶ ἰδοὺ σκότος σκληρὸν
ἐν τῇ ἀπορίᾳ αὐτῶν.

ΚΕΦ. ϛʹ. VI.

ΚΑὶ ἐγένετο, τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ οὗ ἀπέθανεν Ὀζίας ὁ βασιλεύς, 1
εἶδον τὸν Κύριον καθήμενον ἐπὶ θρόνου ὑψηλοῦ καὶ ἐπηρμένου, καὶ
πλήρης δ᾿ οἶκος τῆς δόξης αὐτοῦ. Καὶ Σεραφεὶμ εἰστήκεισαν κύκλῳ 2
αὐτοῦ, ἓξ πτέρυγες τῷ ἑνί, καὶ ἓξ πτέρυγες τῷ ἑνί· καὶ ταῖς μὲν
δυσὶ κατεκάλυπτον τὸ πρόσωπον ἑαυτῶν, καὶ ταῖς δυσὶ κατε-
κάλυπτον τοὺς πόδας ἑαυτῶν, καὶ ταῖς δυσὶν ἐπέταντο. Καὶ 3
ἐκέκραγεν ἕτερος πρὸς τὸν ἕτερον, καὶ ἔλεγον· Ἅγιος ἅγιος ἅγιος
Κύριος Σαβαώθ· πλήρης πᾶσα ἡ γῆ τῆς δόξης αὐτοῦ. Καὶ 4
ἐπήρθη τὸ ὑπέρθυρον ἀπὸ τῆς φωνῆς ἧς ἐκέκραγον, καὶ ὁ οἶκος
ἐπλήσθη καπνοῦ. Καὶ εἶπα· ὢ τάλας ἐγώ, ὅτι κατανένυγμαι, ὅτι 5
ἄνθρωπος ὢν, καὶ ἀκάθαρτα χείλη ἔχων, ἐν μέσῳ λαοῦ ἀκάθαρτα
χείλη ἔχοντος ἐγὼ οἰκῶ· καὶ τὸν βασιλέα Κύριον Σαβαὼθ εἶδον
τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς μου. Καὶ ἀπεστάλη πρὸς με ἓν τῶν Σεραφείμ, καὶ 6
ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ εἶχεν ἄνθρακα πυρός, ὃν τῇ λαβίδι ἔλαβεν
ἀπὸ τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου· καὶ ἥψατο τοῦ στόματός μου, καὶ εἶπεν· 7
ἰδοὺ ἥψατο τοῦτο τῶν χειλέων σου, καὶ ἀφελεῖ τὰς ἀνομίας σου,

### 2. A free and highly literary translation

**25** The wrath of the Lord of Sabaoth was kindled against His people,
And He stretched forth His hand upon them, and smote them.
And the mountains were shaken,
And their dead bodies became as dung in the midst of the way.
In all these things, His wrath turned not away,
But still His hand [is] uplifted.

**26** Therefore shall He lift up a banner among the nations far off,
And shall hiss unto them from the uttermost part of the earth:
And behold, swiftly and lightly do they come!
**27** None among them shall hunger nor be weary;
None shall slumber nor sleep;
Neither shall they loose their girdles from their loins,
Nor shall the thongs of their sandals be broken.
**28** Whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows are bent;
The hooves of their horses shall be accounted as solid rock,
And the wheels of their chariots as a whirlwind.
**29** They shall roar as lions, and shall stand forth as lion's whelps;
And it shall seize and roar as a wild beast,
And shall cast [its prey] forth, and none shall deliver.
**30** And it shall roar against them in that day as the voice of a surging sea;
And they shall look unto the land, and behold,
Hard darkness in their perplexity.

### Chapter 6

**1** And it came to pass, in the year that King Uzziah died,
I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up,
And indeed the house was full of His glory.
**2** And Seraphim stood round about Him,
Each one having six wings, and six wings:
With two they covered their faces,
And with two they covered their feet,
And with two they did fly.
**3** And one cried unto another, and said:
"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Sabaoth;
The whole earth is full of His glory!"
**4** And the lintel of the door was lifted up by the voice of them that cried,
And the house was filled with smoke.
**5** Then said I, "Woe is me! for I am undone;
Because I am a man of unclean lips,
And I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips:
For mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of Sabaoth."
**6** Then flew one of the Seraphim unto me,
Having a live coal in his hand,
Which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar;
**7** And he laid it upon my mouth, and said:
"Lo, this hath touched thy lips;
And thine iniquities shall be taken away,
