τοὺς ἐκ τῶν χωρῶν, καὶ εἰσάξω αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν,
καὶ βοσκήσω αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ τὰ ὄρη Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ ἐν ταῖς φάραγξι,
καὶ ἐν πάσῃ κατοικίᾳ τῆς γῆς· ἐν νομῇ ἀγαθῇ βοσκήσω αὐτοὺς, 14
ἐν τῷ ὄρει τῷ ὑψηλῷ ἐν τῷ ὄρει Ἰσραὴλ· καὶ ἔσονται αἱ μάνδραι
αὐτῶν ἐκεῖ, καὶ κοιμηθήσονται, καὶ ἐκεῖ ἀναπαύσονται ἐν τρυφῇ
ἀγαθῇ, καὶ ἐν νομῇ πίονι βοσκηθήσονται ἐπὶ τῶν ὀρέων τοῦ Ἰ-
σραήλ. Ἐγὼ βοσκήσω τὰ πρόβατά μου, καὶ ἐγὼ ἀναπαύσω αὐ- 15
τά, καὶ ἐπιγνώσονται διότι ἐγὼ εἰμι Κύριος· τάδε λέγει Κύριος
Κύριος. Τὸ ἀπολωλὸς ἐκζητήσω, καὶ τὸ πεπλανημένον ἐπιστρέψω, 16
καὶ τὸ συντετριμμένον καταδήσω, καὶ τὸ ἐκλεῖπον ἐνισχύσω, καὶ
τὸ πίον καὶ τὸ ἰσχυρὸν φυλάξω, καὶ βοσκήσω αὐτὰ μετὰ κρί-
ματος. Καὶ ὑμεῖς τὰ πρόβατα, τάδε λέγει Κύριος Κύριος· ἰδοὺ 17
ἐγὼ διακρινῶ ἀναμέσον προβάτου καὶ προβάτου, κριῶν καὶ τρά-
γων. Καὶ οὐχ ἱκανὸν ὑμῖν, ὅτι τὴν καλὴν νομὴν ἐνέμεσθε, καὶ 18
τὰ κατάλοιπα τῆς νομῆς ὑμῶν τοῖς ποσὶν ὑμῶν κατεπατεῖτε,
καὶ τὸ καθεστηκὸς ὕδωρ ἐπίνετε, καὶ τὸ λοιπὸν τοῖς ποσὶν ὑμῶν
ἐταράσσετε; Καὶ τὰ πρόβατά μου τὰ πατήματα τῶν ποδῶν ὑμῶν 19
ἐνέμοντο, καὶ τὸ τεταραγμένον ὕδωρ ὑπὸ τῶν ποδῶν ὑμῶν ἔπι-
νον; Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς πρὸς αὐτούς· ἰδοὺ 20
ἐγὼ εἰμι διακρινῶ ἀναμέσον προβάτου ἰσχυροῦ καὶ ἀναμέσον
προβάτου ἀσθενοῦς. Ἐπὶ ταῖς πλευραῖς καὶ τοῖς ὤμοις ὑμῶν δι- 21
ωθεῖσθε, καὶ τοῖς κέρασιν ὑμῶν ἐκερατίζετε, καὶ πᾶν τὸ ἐκλεῖ-
πον ἐξεθλίβετε. Καὶ σώσω τὰ πρόβατά μου, καὶ οὐκέτι ἔσονται 22
ἔτι εἰς προνομήν, καὶ κρινῶ ἀναμέσον κριοῦ πρὸς κριὸν, καὶ ἀνα- 23
στήσω ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς ποιμένα ἕνα, καὶ ποιμανεῖ αὐτοὺς, τὸν δοῦλόν
μου Δαυίδ· αὐτὸς ποιμανεῖ αὐτοὺς, καὶ ἔσται αὐτῶν ποιμήν, καὶ 24
ἐγὼ Κύριος ἔσομαι αὐτοῖς εἰς Θεὸν, καὶ Δαυὶδ ἄρχων ἐν μέσῳ
αὐτῶν· ἐγὼ Κύριος ἐλάλησα. Καὶ διαθήσομαι τῷ Δαυὶδ διαθή- 25
κην εἰρήνης, καὶ ἀφανιῶ θηρία πονηρὰ ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς, καὶ κατοι-
κήσουσιν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, καὶ ὑπνώσουσιν ἐν τοῖς δρυμοῖς. Καὶ δώσω 26
αὐτοὺς κύκλῳ τοῦ ὄρους μου· καὶ ἀποστελῶ τὸν ὑετὸν, ὑετὸν
εὐλογίας αὐτοῖς. Καὶ τὰ ξύλα τοῦ πεδίου ἀποδώσει τὸν καρπὸν 27
αὐτῶν, καὶ ἡ γῆ δώσει τὴν ἰσχὺν αὐτῆς, καὶ κατοικήσουσιν ἐπὶ
τῆς γῆς αὐτῶν ἐν ἐλπίδι εἰρήνης, καὶ γνώσονται ὅτι ἐγὼ εἰμι
Κύριος, ἐν τῷ συντρίψαι με τὸν ζυγὸν τοῦ κλοιοῦ αὐτῶν· καὶ ἐ-
ξελοῦμαι αὐτοὺς ἐκ χειρὸς τῶν καταδουλωσαμένων αὐτοὺς, καὶ 28

**Chapter 34**

13 ...them out of the lands, and I will bring them into their own land, and I will feed them upon the mountains of Israel, and in the valleys, and in every inhabited place of the land.
14 In a good pasture will I feed them, upon the high mountain, even upon the mountain of Israel; and there shall their folds be, and they shall lie down, and there shall they rest in good delight, and in a fat pasture shall they be fed upon the mountains of Israel.
15 I Myself will feed My sheep, and I Myself will cause them to rest, and they shall know that I am the Lord: thus saith the Lord, the Lord.
16 That which was lost will I seek out, and that which had strayed will I bring back, and that which was broken will I bind up, and that which was weak will I strengthen: but the fat and the strong will I preserve, and I will feed them with [righteous] judgment.
17 And as for you, O My sheep, thus saith the Lord, the Lord: Behold, I will judge between sheep and sheep, between rams and he-goats.
18 And is it not enough for you that ye have fed in a good pasture, but ye must also tread down with your feet the remainder of your pasture, and drink the settled water, and muddy the rest with your feet?
19 And must My sheep then feed upon the treading of your feet, and drink the troubled water that was muddied by your feet?
20 Therefore thus saith the Lord God unto them: Behold, I am [He that] will judge between the strong sheep and between the weak sheep.
21 Because with your sides and with your shoulders ye have pushed, and with your horns ye have gored, and all the weak [sheep] have ye oppressed.
22 And I will save My sheep, and they shall no longer be for a prey; and I will judge between ram and ram.
23 And I will raise up over them one shepherd, and he shall feed them, even My servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.
24 And I the Lord will be unto them a God, and David a prince in their midst; I the Lord have spoken.
25 And I will make with David a covenant of peace, and I will cause evil beasts to vanish from the land; and they shall dwell in the wilderness, and shall sleep in the forests.
26 And I will grant them [to be safe] round about My mountain; and I will send forth the rain, a rain of blessing upon them.
27 And the trees of the field shall yield their fruit, and the earth shall give her strength; and they shall dwell upon their land in the hope of peace, and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have broken the yoke of their collar; and I will deliver them out of the hand of those who enslaved them,
