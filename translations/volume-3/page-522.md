**Ω Σ Η Ε. ΚΕΦ. Ε´. ϛ´. Ζ´.**

14. οἴκῳ Ἰούδα· καὶ ἐγὼ ἁρπάζωμαι, καὶ πορεύσομαι, καὶ λήψομαι, καὶ
15. οὐκ ἔσται ὁ ἐξαιρούμενος· πορεύσομαι καὶ ἐπιστρέψω εἰς τὸν τόπον μου, ἕως οὗ ἀφανισθῶσι, καὶ ἐπιζητήσουσι τὸ πρόσωπόν μου.

**ΚΕΦ. ϛ´. VI.**

1. ἘΝ θλίψει αὐτῶν ὀρθριοῦσι πρός με, λέγοντες· πορευθῶμεν,
    καὶ ἐπιστρέψωμεν πρὸς Κύριον τὸν Θεὸν ἡμῶν, ὅτι αὐτὸς ἥρπακε καὶ ἰάσεται ἡμᾶς, πατάξει καὶ μισώσει ἡμᾶς·
2. ὑγιάσει ἡμᾶς μετὰ δύο ἡμέρας, ἐν τῇ ἡμέρα τῇ τρίτῃ ἀναστησόμεθα, καὶ ζησόμεθα ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ, καὶ γνωσόμεθα·
3. διώξωμεν τοῦ γνῶναι τὸν Κύριον, ὡς ὄρθρον ἕτοιμον εὑρήσομεν αὐτόν, καὶ ἥξει ὡς δετὸς ἡμῖν πρώϊμος καὶ ὄψιμος τῇ γῇ.
4. Τί σοι ποιήσω Ἐφραίμ; τί σοι ποιήσω Ἰούδα; τὸ δὲ ἔλεος ὑμῶν ὡς νεφέλη πρωϊνή, καὶ
5. ὡς δρόσος ὀρθρινὴ πορευομένη. Διὰ τοῦτο ἀπεθέρισα τοὺς προφήτας ὑμῶν, ἀπέκτεινα αὐτοὺς ἐν ῥήμασι στόματός μου· καὶ τὸ
6. κρίμα μου ὡς φῶς ἐξελεύσεται. Διότι ἔλεος θέλω καὶ οὐ θυσίαν,
7. καὶ ἐπίγνωσιν Θεοῦ ἢ ὁλοκαυτώματα. Αὐτοὶ δὲ εἰσιν ὡς ἄνθρωπος παραβαίνων διαθήκην· ἐκεῖ κατεφρόνησέ μου,
8. Γαλαὰδ πόλις ἐργαζομένη μάταια, ταράσσουσα ὕδωρ, καὶ ἡ ἰσχύς σου ἀνδρὸς
9. πειρατοῦ. Ἔκρυψαν ἱερεῖς ὁδὸν Κυρίου, ἐφόνευσαν Σίχιμα, ὅτι
10. ἀνομίαν ἐποίησαν. Ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ Ἰσραὴλ εἶδον φρικώδη· ἐκεῖ πορνείαν τοῦ Ἐφραίμ, ἐμιάνθη Ἰσραὴλ καὶ Ἰούδας· ἄρχου τρυγᾶν σεαυτῷ, ἐν τῷ ἐπιστρέφειν με τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν τοῦ λαοῦ μου.

**ΚΕΦ. Ζ´. VII.**

1. ἘΝ τῷ ἰᾶσθαί με τὸν Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ ἀποκαλυφθήσεται ἡ ἀδικία Ἐφραίμ, καὶ ἡ κακία Σαμαρείας, ὅτι εἰργάσαντο ψευδῆ· καὶ κλέπτης πρὸς αὐτὸν εἰσελεύσεται, ἐκδιδύσκων λῃστὴς ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ
2. αὐτοῦ, ὅπως συνάδωσιν ὡς συνάδοντες τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτῶν. Πάσας τὰς κακίας αὐτῶν ἐμνήσθην· νῦν ἐκύκλωσεν αὐτοὺς τὰ διαβούλια
3. αὐτῶν, ἀπέναντι τοῦ προσώπου μου ἐγένοντο. Ἐν ταῖς κακίαις αὐτῶν εὔφραναν βασιλεῖς, καὶ ἐν τοῖς ψεύδεσιν αὐτῶν ἄρχοντας·
4. πάντες μοιχεύοντες. Ὡς κλίβανος καιόμενος εἰς πέψιν καταπαύσει ἀπὸ τῆς φλογὸς ἀπὸ φυράσεως στέατος, ἕως τοῦ ζυμωθῆναι

**HOSEA**
**CHAPTER 5**

**14** ...unto the house of Judah;
    And unto the house of Judah, I Myself shall tear and seize;
    And I shall go, and I shall take,
**15** And there shall be none to deliver.
    I shall go and return to My place,
    Until they be made desolate,
    And they shall seek My face.

**CHAPTER 6**

**1** In their affliction they shall rise early unto Me, saying:
    Let us go, and let us return unto the Lord our God;
    For He hath torn, and He will heal us;
    He hath smitten, and He will hate us;
**2** He shall revive us after two days;
    In the third day we shall arise,
    And we shall live before Him, and we shall know [Him].
**3** Let us pursue to know the Lord;
    As the morning dawn, ready shall we find Him;
    And He shall come unto us as the early and the latter rain to the earth.
**4** What shall I do unto thee, O Ephraim?
    What shall I do unto thee, O Judah?
    For your mercy is as a morning cloud, and
**5** As the morning dew that passeth away.
    Therefore have I hewn down your prophets;
    I have slain them by the words of My mouth;
    And My
**6** Judgment shall go forth as the light.
    For I desire mercy and not sacrifice,
**7** And the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.
    But they are as a man that transgresseth a covenant;
    There did it scorn Me,
**8** Gilead, a city that worketh vanity, troubling the water,
    And thy strength is that of a man [who is] a pirate.
**9** The priests have hid the way of the Lord;
    They have murdered Shechem,
**10** For they have committed iniquity.
    In the house of Israel have I seen a horrible thing;
    There is the whoredom of Ephraim,
    Israel and Judah are defiled.
    Begin thou to gather for thyself,
    When I shall turn the captivity of My people.

**CHAPTER 7**

**1** When I would heal Israel,
    Then shall the iniquity of Ephraim be uncovered,
    And the wickedness of Samaria,
    For they have wrought falsehood;
    And a thief shall come in unto him,
    A robber stripping upon his way,
**2** So that they may agree as those agreeing in their heart.
    I have remembered all their wickedness;
    Now their counsels have encompassed them,
**3** They have come before My face.
    In their wickedness have they gladdened kings,
    And in their lies, rulers;
**4** All of them are adulterers.
    [They are] as an oven burning for baking,
    [Which] shall cease from the flame
    [After] the kneading of fat, until it be leavened.
