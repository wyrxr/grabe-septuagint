ΚΕΦ. Β΄.
25 χυθήσονται αἱ ληνοὶ οἴνου καὶ ἐλαίου. Καὶ ἀνταποδώσω ὑμῖν
ἀντὶ τῶν ἐτῶν ὧν κατέφαγεν ἡ ἄκρις καὶ ὁ βροῦχος καὶ ἡ ἐρυσίβη
καὶ ἡ κάμπη, ἡ δύναμίς μου ἡ μεγάλη, ἣν ἐξαπέστειλα ἐφ᾿
26 ὑμᾶς· καὶ φάγεσθε ἐσθίοντες καὶ ἐμπλησθήσεσθε, καὶ αἰνέσετε τὸ
ὄνομα Κυρίου Θεοῦ ὑμῶν, ἃ ἐποίησε μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν εἰς θαυμάσια· καὶ
27 οὐ μὴ καταισχυνθῇ ὁ λαός μου εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα· καὶ ἐπιγνώσεσθε
ὅτι ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ ἐγώ εἰμι, καὶ ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν,
καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἔτι πλὴν ἐμοῦ· καὶ οὐ μὴ καταισχυνθῶσιν οὐκέτι
πᾶς ὁ λαός μου εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα.
28 Καὶ ἔσται μετὰ ταῦτα, ἐκχεῶ ἀπὸ τοῦ πνεύματός μου ἐπὶ πᾶσαν
σάρκα, καὶ προφητεύσουσιν οἱ υἱοὶ ὑμῶν καὶ αἱ θυγατέρες ὑμῶν,
καὶ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι ὑμῶν ἐνύπνια ἐνυπνιασθήσονται, καὶ οἱ
νεανίσκοι ὑμῶν ὁράσεις ὄψονται.
29 Καὶ γε ἐπὶ τοὺς δούλους μου καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς δούλας μου ἐν ταῖς
ἡμέραις ἐκείναις ἐκχεῶ ἀπὸ τοῦ πνεύματός μου·
30 καὶ δώσω τέρατα ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ, καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς αἷμα καὶ πῦρ
καὶ ἀτμίδα καπνοῦ·
31 ὁ ἥλιος μεταστραφήσεται εἰς σκότος, καὶ ἡ σελήνη εἰς αἷμα, πρὶν
ἐλθεῖν τὴν ἡμέραν Κυρίου τὴν μεγάλην, καὶ ἐπιφανῆ.
32 Καὶ ἔσται, πᾶς ὃς ἂν ἐπικαλέσηται τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου, σωθήσεται·
ὅτι ἐν τῷ ὄρει Σιὼν καὶ ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἔσται ἀνασωζόμενος,
καθότι εἶπε Κύριος, καὶ εὐαγγελιζόμενοι, οὓς Κύριος προσκέκληται.

ΚΕΦ. Γ΄. ΙΙΙ.

1 ΔΙΟΤΙ ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις καὶ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ
ἐκείνῳ, ὅταν ἐπιστρέψω τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν Ἰούδα καὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ,
2 καὶ συνάξω πάντα τὰ ἔθνη, καὶ κατάξω αὐτὰ εἰς τὴν κοιλάδα
Ἰωσαφάτ, καὶ διακριθήσομαι πρὸς αὐτοὺς ἐκεῖ ὑπὲρ τοῦ λαοῦ
μου καὶ τῆς κληρονομίας μου Ἰσραήλ, οἳ διεσπάρησαν ἐν τοῖς
3 ἔθνεσι· καὶ τὴν γῆν μου κατεδείλαντο, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν λαόν μου ἔβαλον
κλήρους, καὶ ἔδωκαν τὰ παιδάρια πόρνας, καὶ τὰ κοράσια
ἐπώλουν ἀντὶ οἴνου, καὶ ἔπινον.
4 Καὶ τί καὶ ὑμεῖς ἐμοὶ Τύρος, καὶ Σιδὼν καὶ πᾶσα Γαλιλαία
ἀλλοφύλων; μὴ ἀνταπόδομα ὑμεῖς ἀνταποδίδοτέ μοι; ἢ μνησικακεῖτε
ὑμεῖς ἐπ᾿ ἐμοὶ ὀξέως; Καὶ ταχέως
5 ἀνταποδώσω τὸ ἀνταπόδομα ὑμῶν εἰς κεφαλὰς ὑμῶν· ἀνθ᾿ ὧν τὸ
ἀργύριόν μου καὶ τὸ χρυσίον μου ἐλάβετε, καὶ τὰ ἐπίλεκτά μου καὶ
6 τὰ καλά μου εἰσηνέγκατε εἰς τοὺς ναοὺς ὑμῶν· καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰούδα

#### Chapter 2

**25** shall overflow with wine and oil. And I will restore to you the years which the locust hath eaten, and the cankerworm, and the mildew, and the caterpillar, [even] My great army, which I sent among you.
**26** And ye shall eat indeed and be satisfied, and praise the Name of the Lord your God, who hath dealt wondrously with you; and My people shall never be put to shame forever.
**27** And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the Lord your God, and there is none other beside Me; and My people shall never again be put to shame forever.
**28** And it shall come to pass afterward, [that] I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your elders shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions.
**29** Yea, and upon My servants and upon My handmaids in those days will I pour out of My Spirit.
**30** And I will show wonders in the heaven, and upon the earth: blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke.
**31** The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the coming of the great and manifest Day of the Lord.
**32** And it shall come to pass, [that] whosoever shall call on the Name of the Lord shall be saved; for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall there be a saved remnant, as the Lord hath said, and messengers of good tidings, even those whom the Lord shall call.

#### Chapter 3

**1** For behold, in those days and in that time, when I shall restore the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,
**2** I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into the Valley of Jehoshaphat; and I will judge with them there for My people and [for] My inheritance, Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations.
**3** And they have divided My land, and have cast lots for My people; and have given the boys for harlots, and have sold the girls for wine, and have drunk [it].
**4** And what [are] ye to Me, O Tyre, and Sidon, and all the coasts of the Philistines? Will ye render Me a recompense? Or do ye remember [evil] against Me swiftly? And swiftly
**5** will I render your recompense upon your own heads, because ye have taken My silver and My gold, and have carried My choicest things and My pleasant things into your temples.
**6** And the children of Judah
