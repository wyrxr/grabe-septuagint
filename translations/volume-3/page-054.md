ΨΑΛΤΗΡΙΟΝ. ΨΑΛΜ. ΟΒ΄. ΟΓ΄.
16 σου ἠσυνθέτηκα. Καὶ ἀπέλαβον τοῦ γνῶναι· τοῦτο κόπος ἐστὶν
17 ἐναντίον μου, ἕως εἰσέλθω εἰς τὸ ἁγιαστήριον τοῦ Θεοῦ· συνῶ εἰς
18 τὰ ἔσχατα αὐτῶν. Πλὴν διὰ τὰς δολιότητας ἔθου αὐτοῖς· κατ-
19 έβαλες αὐτοὺς ἐν τῷ ἐπαρθῆναι. Πῶς ἐγένοντο εἰς ἐρήμωσιν; ἐξά-
20 πινα ἐξέλιπεν, ἀπώλοντο διὰ τὴν ἀνομίαν αὐτῶν. Ὥσεί ἐνύπνιον
   ἐξεγειρομένου, Κύριε ἐν τῇ πόλει σου τὴν εἰκόνα αὐτῶν ἐξουδε-
21 νώσεις. Ὅτι ἐξεκαύθη ἡ καρδία μου, καὶ οἱ νεφροί μου ἠλλοιώ-
22 θησαν· κἀγὼ ἐξουδενωμένος, καὶ οὐκ ἔγνων, κτηνώδης ἐγενόμην
23 παρὰ σοί. Κἀγὼ διαπαντὸς μετὰ σοῦ, ἐκράτησας τῆς χειρός τῆς
24 δεξιᾶς μου· ἐν τῇ βουλῇ σου ὡδήγησάς με, καὶ μετὰ δόξης προσ-
25 ελάβου με. Τί γάρ μοι ὑπάρχει ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ; καὶ παρὰ σοῦ τί
26 ἠθέλησα ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς; Ἐξέλιπεν ἡ καρδία μου καὶ ἡ σάρξ μου· ὁ
   Θεὸς τῆς καρδίας μου, καὶ ἡ μερίς μου ὁ Θεὸς εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα.
27 Ὅτι ἰδοὺ οἱ μακρύνοντες ἑαυτοὺς ἀπὸ σοῦ, ἀπολοῦνται· ἐξωλό-
28 θρευσας πάντα τὸν πορνεύοντα ἀπὸ σοῦ. Ἐμοὶ δὲ τὸ προσκολλᾶ-
   σθαι τῷ Θεῷ ἀγαθόν ἐστι, τίθεσθαι ἐν τῷ Κυρίῳ τὴν ἐλπίδα μου,
   τοῦ ἐξαγγεῖλαι πάντα τὰ ἀπαγγέλματά σου, ἐν ταῖς πύλαις τῆς
   θυγατρὸς Σιών.

ΨΑΛΜ. ΟΓ΄. LXXIII.

1 ΣΥΝΕΣΕΩΣ τῷ Ἀσάφ. Ἱνατί ἀπώσω ὁ Θεὸς εἰς τέλος; ὤρ-
2 γίσθη ὁ θυμός σου ἐπὶ πρόβατα νομῆς σου; Μνήσθητι τῆς συνα-
   γωγῆς σου ἧς ἐκτήσω ἀπ᾿ ἀρχῆς· ἐλυτρώσω ῥάβδον κληρονομίας
3 σου, ὄρος Σιὼν τοῦτο ὃ κατεσκήνωσας ἐν αὐτῷ. Ἔπαρον τὰς χεῖ-
   ράς σου ἐπὶ τὰς ὑπερηφανίας αὐτῶν εἰς τέλος, ὅσα ἐπονηρεύσατο
4 ὁ ἐχθρὸς ἐν τῷ ἁγίῳ (σου). Καὶ ἐνεκαυχήσαντο οἱ μισοῦντές σε
5 ἐν μέσῳ τῆς ἑορτῆς σου· ἔθεντο τὰ σημεῖα αὐτῶν σημεῖα, καὶ οὐκ
   ἔγνωσαν, ὡς εἰς τὴν ἔξοδον ὑπεράνω. Ὡς ἐν δρυμῷ ξύλων ἀξι-
6 ναις ἐξέκοψαν τὰς θύρας αὐτῆς ἐπιτοαυτό· ἐν πελέκει καὶ λαξευ-
7 τηρίῳ κατέῤῥαξαν αὐτήν. Ἐνεπύρισαν ἐν πυρὶ τὸ ἁγιαστήριόν
8 σου· εἰς τὴν γῆν ἐβεβήλωσαν τὸ σκήνωμα τοῦ ὀνόματός σου. Εἶ-
   παν ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτῶν ἡ συγγένεια αὐτῶν ἐπιτοαυτό· (δεῦτε)
9 κατακαύσωμεν πάσας τὰς ἑορτὰς τοῦ Θεοῦ ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς. Τὰ ση-
   μεῖα ἡμῶν οὐκ εἴδομεν· οὐκ ἔστιν ἔτι προφήτης, καὶ ἡμᾶς οὐ γνώ-
10 σεται ἔτι. Ἕως πότε ὁ Θεὸς ὀνειδιεῖ ὁ ἐχθρός; παροξυνεῖ ὁ ὑπεναντίος τὸ ὄνομά σου εἰς τέλος;

**PSALM LXXII.**

16 [I would have dealt faithlessly] with Thy children.
And I set myself to know this;
[Yet] was this a toil before me,
17 Until I entered into the sanctuary of God,
[Then] did I understand their latter end.
18 Nevertheless, for their deceits didst Thou set [a snare] for them;
Thou didst cast them down when they were lifted up.
19 How are they brought to desolation?
Suddenly did they fail, and perish because of their iniquity.
20 As a dream of one awakening,
O Lord, in Thy city shalt Thou bring their image to nought.
21 For my heart was inflamed, and my reins were altered.
22 And I was brought to nought, and knew not;
I became as a beast before Thee.
23 Yet am I continually with Thee;
Thou hast held [me by] my right hand.
24 By Thy counsel hast Thou guided me,
And with glory hast Thou received me.
25 For what is there for me in heaven?
And what have I desired upon the earth apart from Thee?
26 My heart and my flesh have failed;
The God of my heart, and my portion, is God unto the age.
27 For behold, those who remove themselves far from Thee shall perish;
Thou hast destroyed every one who committeth fornication away from Thee.
28 But as for me, it is good to cleave unto God;
To set my hope in the Lord,
To declare all Thy tidings in the gates of the daughter of Zion.

**PSALM LXXIII.**

A Contemplation of Asaph.

1 O God, why hast Thou cast [us] off forever?
Why is Thy wrath kindled against the sheep of Thy pasture?
2 Remember Thy congregation, which Thou hast purchased from the beginning;
Thou hast redeemed the rod of Thine inheritance,
This Mount Zion, wherein Thou hast dwelt.
3 Lift up Thy hands against their utter pride,
All that the enemy hath done wickedly in Thy sanctuary.
4 And those who hate Thee have boasted in the midst of Thy feast;
They have set their signs [to be] signs,
Nor knew they how [to discern] the going forth from on high.
5 As in a forest of trees with axes,
They cut down its doors together.
6 With ax and chisel have they broken it down.
7 They have set Thy sanctuary on fire;
They have defiled unto the ground the tabernacle of Thy Name.
8 Their kinsfolk said in their heart, together,
"(Come,) let us burn up all the feasts of God from the earth."
9 Our signs have we not seen;
There is no prophet anymore, and [Thou] shalt know us no longer.
10 How long, O God, shall the enemy reproach Thee?
Shall the adversary provoke Thy Name unto the end?
