**15** σιλείας ἀπὸ προσώπου βορρᾶ τῆς γῆς, λέγει Κύριος· καὶ ἥξουσι
    καὶ θήσουσιν ἕκαστος τὸν θρόνον αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὰ πρόθυρα τῶν
    πυλῶν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἐπὶ πάντα τὰ τείχη τὰ κύκλῳ αὐτῆς,
    καὶ ἐπὶ πάσας τὰς πόλεις Ἰούδα.
**16** Καὶ λαλήσω πρὸς αὐτοὺς περὶ πάσης τῆς κακίας αὐτῶν μετὰ κρίσεως,
    ὡς ἐγκατέλιπόν με, καὶ ἔθυσαν θεοῖς ἀλλοτρίοις,
    καὶ προσεκύνησαν τοῖς ἔργοις τῶν χειρῶν αὐτῶν.
**17** Καὶ σὺ περίζωσαι τὴν ὀσφῦν σου, καὶ ἀνάστηθι,
    καὶ εἰπὸν πρὸς αὐτοὺς πάντα ὅσα ἂν ἐντείλωμαί σοι·
    μὴ φοβηθῇς ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτῶν, μηδὲ πτοηθῇς ἐναντίον αὐτῶν,
    ὅτι μετὰ σοῦ ἐγώ εἰμι, τοῦ ἐξαιρεῖσθαί σε, λέγει Κύριος.
**18** Ἰδοὺ τέθεικά σε ἐν τῇ σήμερον ἡμέρᾳ, ὡς πόλιν ὀχυράν,
    καὶ ὡς στύλον σιδηροῦν, καὶ ὡς τεῖχος χαλκοῦν,
    ὀχυρὸν ἅπασι τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν Ἰούδα, καὶ τοῖς ἄρχουσιν αὐτοῦ,
    καὶ τῷ λαῷ τῆς γῆς·
**19** Καὶ πολεμήσουσί σε, καὶ οὐ μὴ δύνωνται πρὸς σέ,
    διότι ἐγὼ μετὰ σοῦ εἰμι, τοῦ ἐξαιρεῖσθαί σε, λέγει Κύριος.

#### CHAPTER II. II.

**1-2** ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρός με, λέγων·
    πορεύθητι καὶ ἀνάγνωθι ἐν τοῖς ὠσὶν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ εἰπέ·
    τάδε λέγει Κύριος· ἐμνήσθην ἐλέους νεότητός σου
    καὶ ἀγάπης τελειώσεώς σου, τοῦ ἐξακολουθῆσαί σε τῷ ἁγίῳ Ἰσραὴλ
    ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ ἐν γῇ μὴ σπαρείσῃ, λέγει Κύριος.
**3** Ἅγιος Ἰσραὴλ τῷ Κυρίῳ ἀρχὴ γεννημάτων αὐτοῦ,
    πάντες οἱ ἔσθοντες αὐτὸν πλημμελήσουσι,
    κακὰ ἥξει ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς, φησὶ Κύριος.
**4** Ἀκούσατε λόγον Κυρίου οἶκος Ἰακώβ,
    καὶ πᾶσα πατριὰ οἴκου Ἰσραήλ.
**5** Τάδε λέγει Κύριος· τί εὕροσαν οἱ πατέρες ὑμῶν ἐν ἐμοὶ πλημμέλημα;
    ὅτι ἀπέστησαν μακρὰν ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ, καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν ὀπίσω τῶν ματαίων,
    καὶ ἐματαιώθησαν,
**6** καὶ οὐκ εἶπαν, ποῦ ἐστι Κύριος, ὁ ἀναγαγὼν ἡμᾶς ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου,
    ὁ καθοδηγήσας ἡμᾶς ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ ἐν γῇ ἀβάτῳ καὶ ἀπείρῳ,
    ἐν γῇ ἀνύδρῳ καὶ ἀκάρπῳ, ἐν γῇ ἐν ᾗ οὐ διώδευσεν ἐν αὐτῇ ἀνὴρ οὐδὲν,
    καὶ οὐ κατώκησεν ἄνθρωπος ἐκεῖ;
**7** Καὶ ἤγαγον ὑμᾶς εἰς τὸν Κάρμηλον, τοῦ φαγεῖν ὑμᾶς τοὺς καρποὺς αὐτοῦ,
    καὶ τὰ ἀγαθὰ αὐτοῦ· καὶ εἰσήλθατε, καὶ ἐμιάνατε τὴν γῆν μου,
    καὶ τὴν κληρονομίαν μου ἔθεσθε εἰς βδέλυγμα.
**8** Οἱ ἱερεῖς οὐκ εἶπαν, ποῦ ἐστι Κύριος,
    καὶ οἱ ἀντεχόμενοι τοῦ νόμου μου, οὐκ ἐπίσταντό με,
    καὶ οἱ ποιμένες ἠσέβουν εἰς ἐμέ, καὶ οἱ προφῆται ἐπροφητεύοντο τῇ Βάαλ,
    καὶ ὀπίσω ἀνωφελοῦς ἐπορεύθησαν.

**15** kingdoms from the face of the north of the land," saith the Lord;
    "and they shall come, and each one shall set his throne upon the entries
    of the gates of Jerusalem, even against all the walls that are round about her,
    and against all the cities of Judah.
**16** And I will speak judgments against them, concerning all their wickedness,
    because they have forsaken Me, and have sacrificed unto alien gods,
    and have worshipped the works of their own hands."
**17** "But as for thee, gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them
    all things whatsoever I shall command thee. Be not afraid of their faces,
    neither be dismayed before them, for I am with thee to deliver thee,"
    saith the Lord.
**18** "Behold, I have made thee this day as a fortified city,
    and as an iron pillar, and as a wall of bronze,
    [firm] against all the kings of Judah, and against its princes,
    and against the people of the land;
**19** And they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee;
    for I am with thee to deliver thee," saith the Lord.

#### CHAPTER II.

**1-2** Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
    "Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, and say:
    'Thus saith the Lord: I remember the mercy of thy youth,
    and the love of thine espousals, how thou didst follow after the Holy One of Israel
    in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown,' saith the Lord.
**3** Israel is holy unto the Lord, the firstfruits of His increase.
    All who devour him shall incur guilt; and evils shall come upon them,"
    saith the Lord.
**4** "Hear ye the word of the Lord, O house of Jacob,
    and all the clans of the house of Israel!
**5** Thus saith the Lord: What fault found your fathers in Me,
    that they went far from Me, and walked after vain things,
    and became themselves vain,
**6** And they said not, 'Where is the Lord,
    who brought us up out of the land of Egypt?
    He who led us through the wilderness,
    through a land untrodden and boundless,
    through a land parched and unfruitful;
    a land where no man passed through, nor did any man dwell there?'
**7** And I brought you into the garden land, to eat the fruit thereof,
    and the good things thereof; but when ye had entered,
    ye defiled My land, and made My heritage an abomination.
**8** The priests said not, 'Where is the Lord?'
    And they who held to My law knew Me not.
    The shepherds also transgressed against Me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal,
    and walked after that which profiteth not."
