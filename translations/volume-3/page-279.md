ΚΕΦ. Γ΄. ΙΕΡΕΜΙΑΣ 1217
πρὸς αὐτὸν ἔτι, οὐ μιανομένη μιανθήσεται ἡ γῆ ἐκείνη; καὶ σὺ
ἐξεπόρνευσας ἐν ποιμέσι πολλοῖς, καὶ ἀνέκαμπτες πρὸς μέ, λέ-
γει Κύριος. Ἄρον εἰς εὐθεῖαν τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς σου, λέγει Κύ- 2
ριος, καὶ ἴδε, ποῦ οὐχὶ ἐξεφύρθης ἐπὶ ταῖς ὁδοῖς αἷς ἐκάθισας
αὐτοῖς ὡσεὶ κορώνη ἐρημωμένη, καὶ ἐμίανας τὴν γῆν ἐν ταῖς
πορνείαις σου καὶ ἐν ταῖς κακίαις σου, καὶ ἔσχες ποιμένας πολλοὺς 3
εἰς πρόσκομμα σεαυτῇ· ὄψις πόρνης ἐγένετό σοι, ἀπηναισχύν-
τητας πρὸς πάντας. Οὐχ ὡς οἶκόν με ἐκάλεσας καὶ πα- 4
τέρα καὶ ἀρχηγὸν τῆς παρθενίας σου; Μὴ διαμενεῖ εἰς τὸν 5
αἰῶνα, ἢ διαφυλαχθήσεται εἰς νῖκος; Ἰδοὺ ἐλάλησας, καὶ ἐποί-
ησας τὰ πονηρὰ ταῦτα, καὶ ἠδυνάσθης. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς 6
μὲ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις Ἰωσία τοῦ βασιλέως· ἴδες ἃ ἐποίησέ μοι ἡ
κατοικία τοῦ Ἰσραήλ; ἐπορεύθησαν ἐπὶ πᾶν ὄρος ὑψηλόν, καὶ
ὑποκάτω παντὸς ξύλου ἀλσώδους, καὶ ἐπόρνευσαν ἐκεῖ. Καὶ εἶ- 7
πα· μετὰ τὸ πορνεῦσαι αὐτὴν πάντα ταῦτα, πρὸς μὲ ἀνάστρεφον,
καὶ οὐκ ἀνέστρεψε. Καὶ ἴδε τὴν ἀσυνθεσίαν αὐτῆς ἢ ἀσύνθετος
Ἰούδα ἡ ἀδελφὴ αὐτῆς. Καὶ ἴδον, διότι περὶ πάντων ὧν κατελή- 8
φθη ἐν οἷς ἐμιχεύατο ἡ κατοικία τοῦ Ἰσραήλ· καὶ ἐξαπέστειλα
αὐτήν, καὶ ἔδωκα αὐτῇ βιβλίον ἀποστασίου εἰς τὰς χεῖρας αὐ-
τῆς· καὶ οὐκ ἐφοβήθη ἡ ἀσύνθετος Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐπορεύθη, καὶ ἐπόρ-
νευσε καὶ αὐτή, καὶ ἐγένετο εἰς οὐδὲν ἡ πορνεία αὐτῆς, καὶ 9
ἐφονεκτόνει τὴν γῆν, καὶ ἐμίσγευσε τὸ ξύλον καὶ τὸν λίθον. Καὶ 10
ἐν πᾶσι τούτοις οὐκ ἐπεστράφη πρὸς μὲ ἡ ἀσύνθετος ἀδελφὴ αὐ-
τῆς Ἰούδα ἐξ ὅλης τῆς καρδίας αὐτῆς, ἀλλ᾽ ἐπὶ ψεύδει, φησὶ Κύ-
ριος. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς μέ· ἐδικαίωσε τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ ἡ 11
ἀποστροφὴ Ἰσραὴλ ἀπὸ τῆς ἀσυνθέτου Ἰούδα. Πορεύθητι καὶ 12
ἀνάγνωθι τοὺς λόγους τούτους πρὸς βορρᾶν, καὶ ἐρεῖς, ἐπιστρά-
φηθι πρὸς μὲ ἡ κατοικία τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, λέγει Κύριος· καὶ οὐ
στηριῶ τὸ πρόσωπόν μου ἐφ᾽ ὑμᾶς, ὅτι ἐλεῶν ἐγώ εἰμι, λέγει
Κύριος, καὶ οὐ μηνιῶ ὑμῖν εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα. Πλὴν, γνῶθι τὴν ἀδι- 13
κίαν σου, ὅτι εἰς Κύριον τὸν Θεόν σου ἠσέβησας, καὶ διέχεας
τὰς ὁδούς σου εἰς ἀλλοτρίους ὑποκάτω παντὸς ξύλου ἀλσώδους,
τῆς δὲ φωνῆς μου οὐκ ἤκουσας, λέγει Κύριος. Ἐπιστράφητε 14
υἱοὶ ἀπεστηκότες, λέγει Κύριος, διότι ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ κατακυριεύσω
ὑμῶν, καὶ λήψομαι ὑμᾶς ἕνα ἐκ πόλεως καὶ δύο ἐκ πατριᾶς, καὶ 15
εἰσάξω ὑμᾶς εἰς Σιών, καὶ δώσω ὑμῖν ποιμένας κατὰ τὴν καρ-

### Chapter 3

**1** ...to him again? Shall not that land be utterly defiled? And thou hast played the harlot among many shepherds, yet thou didst return unto Me," saith the Lord.
**2** "Lift up thine eyes unto the straight path," saith the Lord, "and behold, where hast thou not been defiled upon the ways wherein thou didst sit for them as a desolate raven; and thou hast defiled the land with thy fornications and with thy wickedness.
**3** And thou hadst many shepherds for a stumbling-block unto thyself. The face of a harlot was made unto thee; thou wast shameless toward all."
**4** "Didst thou not call Me as thy House, and Father, and Guide of thy virginity?"
**5** "Will it remain forever, or shall it be kept unto victory? Behold, thou didst speak, and didst these evil things, and thou wast able to [do them]."
**6** Moreover the Lord said unto me in the days of Josiah the king: "Hast thou seen what the house of Israel hath done unto Me? They have gone upon every high mountain, and under every wooded tree, and there they have committed whoredom.
**7** And I said, 'After she hath committed all these whoredoms, "Return thou unto Me,"' yet she returned not. And behold, her treachery, even the treacherous Judah her sister."
**8** "And I saw that for all the matters wherein the house of Israel was caught in which she committed adultery, I sent her away, and gave her a bill of divorce into her hands. Yet the treacherous Judah feared not, but went and committed whoredom also; and her whoredom came to naught,
**9** And she defiled the land with bloodshed, and mingled herself with the wood and the stone.
**10** And for all these things, yet her treacherous sister Judah returned not unto Me with all her heart, but feignedly," saith the Lord.
**11** And the Lord said unto me: "The backsliding Israel hath justified his soul more than treacherous Judah."
**12** "Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say: 'Return unto Me, O house of Israel,' saith the Lord; 'and I will not cause My countenance to fall upon you, for I am merciful,' saith the Lord, 'and I will not be wroth with you forever.'
**13** Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast dealt treacherously against the Lord thy God, and hast scattered thy ways unto strangers under every wooded tree, and My voice thou hast not hearkened unto," saith the Lord.
**14** "Return, O backsliding children," saith the Lord; "for behold, I will reclaim you, and I will take you one from a city and two from a family,
**15** And I will bring you into Zion, and I will give you shepherds according to My heart."
