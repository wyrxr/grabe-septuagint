**ΚΕΦ. ΝΔ΄. LV. ΗΣΑΙΑΣ 1197**
καὶ πᾶσα φωνὴ ἡ ἀναστήσεται ἐπὶ σὲ εἰς κρίσιν· πάντας αὐτοὺς
ἡττήσεις, οἱ δὲ ἔνοχοί σου ἔσονται ἐν αὐτῇ. Ἔστι κληρονομία
τοῖς θεραπεύουσι Κύριον, καὶ ὑμεῖς ἔσεσθέ μοι δίκαιοι, λέγει
Κύριος.

**ΚΕΦ. ΝΕ΄. LV.**
**1.** Οἱ διψῶντες πορεύεσθε ἐφ᾽ ὕδωρ, καὶ ὅσοι μὴ ἔχετε ἀργύριον,
βαδίσαντες ἀγοράσατε, καὶ φάγετε καὶ πορεύεσθε καὶ ἀγοράσατε
ἄνευ ἀργυρίου καὶ τιμῆς οἶνον καὶ στέαρ.
**2.** Ἱνατί τιμᾶσθε ἀργυρίου ἐν οὐκ ἄρτοις καὶ τὸν μόχθον ὑμῶν οὐκ
εἰς πλησμονήν; ἀκούσατε ἀκοήν μου, καὶ φάγεσθε ἀγαθά, καὶ
ἐντρυφήσει ἐν ἀγαθοῖς ἡ ψυχὴ ὑμῶν.
**3.** Προσέχετε τοῖς ὠτίσιν ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐπακολουθήσατε ταῖς ὁδοῖς
μου· ἐπακούσατέ μου, καὶ ζήσεται ἐν ἀγαθοῖς ἡ ψυχὴ ὑμῶν, καὶ
διαθήσομαι ὑμῖν διαθήκην αἰώνιον, τὰ ὅσια Δαυὶδ τὰ πιστά.
**4.** Ἰδοὺ μαρτύριον ἐν ἔθνεσι δέδωκα αὐτόν ἄρχοντα καὶ προστάσσοντα ἔθνεσιν.
**5.** Ἰδοὺ ἔθνη ἃ οὐκ ᾔδεισάν σε, ἐπικαλέσονταί σε, καὶ λαοὶ οἳ οὐκ
ἐπίστανταί σε, ἐπὶ σὲ καταφεύξονται, ἕνεκεν Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ σου
καὶ τοῦ ἁγίου Ἰσραήλ, ὅτι ἐδόξασέ σε.
**6.** Ζητήσατε τὸν Κύριον, καὶ ἐν τῷ εὑρίσκειν αὐτόν ἐπικαλέσασθε·
ἡνίκα ἂν ἐγγίζει ὑμῖν,
**7.** ἀπολιπέτω ὁ ἀσεβὴς τὰς ὁδοὺς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀνὴρ ἄνομος τὰς βουλὰς
αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπιστραφήτω ἐπὶ Κύριον, καὶ ἐλεηθήσεται, ὅτι ἐπὶ πολὺ
ἀφήσει τὰς ἁμαρτίας ὑμῶν.
**8.** Οὐ γὰρ εἰσιν αἱ βουλαί μου ὥσπερ αἱ βουλαὶ ὑμῶν, οὐδὲ ὥσπερ αἱ
ὁδοί ὑμῶν αἱ ὁδοί μου, λέγει Κύριος.
**9.** Ἀλλ᾽ ὡς ἀπέχει ὁ οὐρανὸς ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς, οὕτως ἀπέχει ἡ ὁδός μου
ἀπὸ τῶν ὁδῶν ὑμῶν, καὶ τὰ διανοήματα ὑμῶν ἀπὸ τῆς διανοίας μου.
**10.** Ὡς γὰρ ἐὰν καταβῇ ὁ ὑετὸς ἡ χιὼν ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ οὐ μὴ
ἀποστραφῇ ἐκεῖ ἕως ἂν μεθύσῃ τὴν γῆν, καὶ ἐκτέκῃ, καὶ βλαστήσῃ,
καὶ δώσει σπέρμα τῷ σπείροντι, καὶ ἄρτον εἰς βρῶσιν,
**11.** οὕτως ἔσται τὸ ῥῆμά μου, ὃ ἐὰν ἐξέλθῃ ἐκ τοῦ στόματός μου, οὐ
μὴ ἀποστραφῇ πρὸς με κενόν, ἕως ἂν συντελεσθῇ ὅσα ἠθέλησα, καὶ
εὐοδώσω τὰς ὁδούς σου, καὶ τὰ ἐντάλματά μου.
**12.** Ἐν γὰρ εὐφροσύνῃ ἐξελεύσεσθε, καὶ ἐν χαρᾷ διδαχθήσεσθε· τὰ γὰρ
ὄρη καὶ οἱ βουνοὶ ἐξαλοῦνται προσδεχόμενοι ὑμᾶς ἐν χαρᾷ, καὶ
πάντα τὰ ξύλα τοῦ ἀγροῦ ἐπικροτήσει τοῖς κλάδοις, καὶ ἀντὶ τῆς
στοιβῆς
**13.** ἀναβήσεται κυπάρισσος, ἀντὶ δὲ τῆς κονύζης ἀναβήσεται μυρσίνη˙
καὶ ἔσται Κύριος εἰς ὄνομα, καὶ εἰς σημεῖον αἰώνιον, καὶ οὐκ ἐκλείψει.

#### Chapter 54 (Continued)

**17** ...and every voice that shall rise up against thee in judgment,
    all of them shalt thou overcome;
    and thine offenders shall be [found] therein.
    This [is] the inheritance of those that serve the Lord,
    and ye shall be righteous unto Me, saith the Lord.

#### Chapter 55

**1** Ho, everyone that thirsteth, come ye to the waters,
    and ye that have no money, come ye, buy, and eat;
    yea, come, buy wine and fat without money and without price.
**2** Wherefore do ye spend for money that which is not bread?
    and your labor for that which satisfieth not?
    Hearken diligently unto Me, and eat ye that which is good,
    and your soul shall delight itself in abundance.
**3** Incline your ears, and come unto Me;
    hearken, and your soul shall live in good things,
    and I will make an everlasting covenant with you,
    even the sure mercies of David.
**4** Behold, I have given him for a witness to the nations,
    a ruler and a commander to the nations.
**5** Behold, nations that knew thee not shall call upon thee,
    and peoples that knew thee not shall run unto thee;
    because of the Lord thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel;
    for He hath glorified thee.
**6** Seek ye the Lord while He may be found;
    call ye upon Him while He is near.
**7** Let the ungodly forsake his ways,
    and the unrighteous man his thoughts;
    and let him return unto the Lord, and He will have mercy upon him;
    for He will abundantly pardon your sins.
**8** For My thoughts are not as your thoughts,
    neither as your ways, My ways, saith the Lord.
**9** But as the heaven is far from the earth,
    so is My way far from your ways,
    and your thoughts from My thoughts.
**10** For as the rain or the snow cometh down from heaven,
    and returneth not thither,
    until it have watered the earth, and brought forth, and made it bud,
    and given seed to the sower, and bread for food;
**11** So shall My word be that goeth forth out of My mouth;
    it shall not return unto Me void,
    until it be accomplished whatsoever I pleased,
    and I will prosper thy ways, and My commandments.
**12** For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with gladness:
    the mountains and the hills shall leap forth before you into singing,
    and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands with their branches.
**13** Instead of the bramble shall come up the cypress tree,
    and instead of the nettle shall come up the myrtle tree;
    and it shall be to the Lord for a name,
    for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.
