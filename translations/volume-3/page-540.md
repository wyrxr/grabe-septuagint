    ἐκζητήσωσιν οἱ κατάλοιποι τῶν ἀνθρώπων με καὶ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη,
    ἐφ᾽ οὓς ἐπικέκληται τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς, λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς
    13 ὁ ποιῶν ταῦτα. Ἰδοὺ ἡμέραι ἔρχονται, λέγει Κύριος, καὶ κατα-
    λήψεται ὁ ἀλοητὸς τὸν τρυγητὴν, καὶ περκάσει ἡ σταφυλὴ ἐν τῷ
    σπόρῳ, καὶ ἀποσταλάξει τὰ ὄρη γλυκασμὸν, καὶ πάντες οἱ βου-
    14 νοὶ σύμφυτοι ἔσονται· καὶ ἐπιστρέψω τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν τοῦ λαοῦ
    μου Ἰσραήλ, καὶ οἰκοδομήσουσι πόλεις τὰς ἠφανισμένας, καὶ κα-
    τοικήσουσι, καὶ καταφυτεύσουσι ἀμπελῶνας, καὶ πίονται τὸν οἶ-
    νον αὐτῶν, καὶ ποιήσουσι κήπους, καὶ φάγονται τὸν καρπὸν αὐ-
    15 τῶν· καὶ καταφυτεύσω αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς αὐτῶν, καὶ οὐ μὴ
    ἐκσπασθῶσιν οὐκέτι ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς αὐτῶν, ἧς ἔδωκα αὐτοῖς, λέγει
    Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὁ παντοκράτωρ.

    **14** And I will turn the captivity of My people Israel, and they shall build the ruined cities and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards and drink the wine thereof; and they shall make gardens and eat the fruit thereof.
    **15** And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no longer be pulled up from their land which I have given them," saith the Lord God Almighty.
