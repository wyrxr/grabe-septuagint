11 ται· Καὶ πληθυνῶ ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς ἀνθρώπους, καὶ κτήνη, καὶ κατοικιῶ ὑμᾶς ὡς τὸ ἐν ἀρχῇ ὑμῶν, καὶ εὖ ποιήσω ὑμᾶς, ὥσπερ τὰ
12 ἔμπροσθεν ὑμῶν, καὶ γνώσεσθε ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι Κύριος. Καὶ γεννήσω ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς ἀνθρώπους τὸν λαόν μου Ἰσραήλ, καὶ κληρονομήσουσιν ὑμᾶς, καὶ ἔσεσθε αὐτοῖς εἰς κατάσχεσιν· καὶ οὐ μὴ προστεθήσε13 σθε ἔτι ἀτεκνωθῆναι ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν. Τάδε λέγει ᾿Αδωναὶ Κύριος· ἀνθρώπων εἰπεῖν σοι, κατέσθουσα ἀνθρώπους εἶ, καὶ ἠτεκνωμένη ὑπὸ τοῦ 14 ἔθνους σου ἐγένου. Διὰ τοῦτο ἀνθρώπους οὐκέτι φάγεσαι, καὶ τὸ 15 ἔθνος σου οὐκ ἀτεκνώσεις οὐκέτι, λέγει ᾿Αδωναὶ Κύριος. Καὶ οὐκ ἀκουσθήσεται οὐλέτι ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς ἀτιμία ἐθνῶν, καὶ ὀνειδισμὸν λαῶν οὐ μὴ ἐνέγκητε ἔτι, καὶ τὸ ἔθνος σου οὐκ ἀτεκνωθήσεται ἔτι, λέγει 1617 Κύριος ὁ Θεός. Καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς με, λέγων· υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, οἶκος Ἰσραὴλ κατώκησαν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἀκαθαρσίαις αὐτῶν ἐμίαναν αὐτὴν ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐν τοῖς εἰδώλοις αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἀκαθαρσίαις αὐτῶν· κατὰ τὴν ἀκαθαρσίαν τῆς ἀποκαθημένης ἐγενήθη ἡ ὁδὸς αὐτῶν πρὸ προσώ18 που μου, καὶ ἐξέχεα τὸν θυμόν μου ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς περὶ τοῦ αἵματος, οὗ ἐξέχεαν ἐν τῇ γῇ, καὶ ἐν τοῖς εἰδώλοις αὐτῶν ἐμίαναν αὐτήν. 19 Καὶ διέσπειρα αὐτοὺς εἰς τὰ ἔθνη, καὶ ἐλίμησκα αὐτοὺς εἰς τὰς χώρας· κατὰ τὴν ὁδὸν αὐτῶν, καὶ κατὰ τὰ ἐπιτηδεύματα αὐτῶν ἔκρινα 20 αὐτούς. Καὶ εἰσῆλθον εἰς τὰ ἔθνη, οὗ εἰσῆλθον ἐκεῖ, καὶ ἐβεβήλωσαν τὸ ὄνομά μου τὸ ἅγιον ἐν τῷ λέγεσθαι αὐτοὺς, λαὸς Κυρίου 21 οὗτοι, καὶ ἐκ τῆς γῆς αὐτοῦ ἐξῆλθον. Καὶ ἐρεισάμην αὐτῶν διὰ τὸ ὄνομά μου τὸ ἅγιον, ὃ ἐβεβήλωσαν οἶκος Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν, οὗ 22 εἰσῆλθον ἐκεῖ. Διὰ τοῦτο εἰπὸν τῷ οἴκῳ Ἰσραήλ· τάδε λέγει ᾿Αδωναὶ Κύριος· οὐχ ὑμῖν ἐγὼ ποιῶ οἶκος Ἰσραήλ, ἀλλ᾿ ἢ διὰ τὸ ὄνομά μου τὸ ἅγιον, ὃ ἐβεβηλώσατε ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν, οὗ εἰ23 σῆλθάτε ἐκεῖ. Καὶ ἁγιάσω τὸ ὄνομά μου τὸ μέγα, τὸ βεβηλωθὲν ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν, ὃ ἐβεβηλώσατε ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῶν, καὶ γνώσονται τὰ ἔθνη ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι Κύριος, λέγει ᾿Αδωναὶ Κύριος· ἐν 24 τῷ ἁγιασθῆναι με ἐν ὑμῖν κατ᾿ ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτῶν, καὶ λήψομαι ὑμᾶς ἐκ τῶν ἐθνῶν, καὶ ἀθροίσω ὑμᾶς ἐκ πασῶν τῶν γαιῶν, καὶ 25 εἰσάξω ὑμᾶς εἰς τὴν γῆν ὑμῶν, καὶ ῥανῶ ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς· ὕδωρ καθαρόν, καὶ καθαρισθήσεσθε ἀπὸ πασῶν τῶν ἀκαθαρσιῶν ὑμῶν, καὶ 26 ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν εἰδώλων ὑμῶν· καὶ καθαριῶ ὑμᾶς, καὶ δώσω ὑμῖν καρδίαν καινήν, καὶ πνεῦμα καινὸν δώσω ἐν ὑμῖν, καὶ ἀ[φελῶ]

11 And I will multiply upon you men, and cattle;
and I will cause you to be inhabited as in your beginning,
and I will deal well with you, as in your former times;
and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
12 And I will bring forth upon you men, even My people Israel;
and they shall inherit you, and ye shall be for them a possession;
and ye shall no more be made barren of them.
13 Thus saith Adonai the Lord:
Because men speak concerning thee, saying,
'Thou art a devourer of men!'
and thou hast been made childless by thy nation;
14 Therefore thou shalt devour men no more,
and thy nation shalt thou make childless no longer, saith Adonai the Lord.
15 And the dishonor of the nations shall no longer be heard against you,
and ye shall bear the reproach of peoples no more,
and thy nation shall no more be made childless, saith the Lord God.

16 Moreover, the word of the Lord came unto me, saying:
'Son of man,
17 The house of Israel dwelt upon their own land,
and defiled it by their uncleanness, in their way of life,
and by their idols, and by their uncleanness;
like the uncleanness of her that is set apart [in her monthly courses],
so was their way before My face.
18 Therefore I poured out My wrath upon them because of the blood,
which they had shed upon the land,
and because they had defiled it with their idols.
19 And I scattered them among the nations,
and caused them to suffer famine in the lands;
according to their way of life, and according to their practices, I judged them.
20 And when they entered into the nations, whither they entered there,
they profaned My holy Name,
in that it was said of them,
'These are the people of the Lord, and out of His land are they gone forth.'
21 But I had pity for My holy Name's sake,
which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations,
whither they entered there.
22 Therefore say unto the house of Israel:
Thus saith Adonai the Lord:
Not for your sake do I this, O house of Israel,
but for My holy Name's sake,
which ye have profaned among the nations, whither ye entered there.
23 And I will sanctify My great Name,
which was profaned among the nations,
which ye have profaned in the midst of them;
and the nations shall know that I am the Lord, saith Adonai the Lord,
when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.
24 For I will take you from among the nations,
and I will gather you out of all the lands,
and I will bring you into your own land.
25 And I will sprinkle upon you: clean water,
and ye shall be cleansed from all your uncleannesses,
and from all your idols;
26 And I will cleanse you, and I will give you a new heart,
and a new spirit will I put within you,
and I will remove
