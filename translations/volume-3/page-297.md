**ΚΕΦ. ΙΓ. ΧΙΙΙ.**
**1** ΤΑΔΕ λέγει Κύριος πρός με· βάδισον καὶ κτῆσαι σεαυτῷ περίζωμα λινοῦν, καὶ περίθου περὶ τὴν ὀσφῦν σου, καὶ ἐν ὕδατι οὐ διελεύσεται.
**2** Καὶ ἐκτησάμην τὸ περίζωμα κατὰ τὸν λόγον Κυρίου, καὶ περιέθηκα περὶ τὴν ὀσφῦν μου.
**3** Καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς μέ, λέγων·
**4** Λάβε τὸ περίζωμα ὃ ἐκτήσω, τὸ περὶ τὴν ὀσφῦν σου, καὶ ἀνάστηθι, καὶ βάδισον ἐπὶ τὸν Εὐφράτην, καὶ κατακρύψον αὐτὸ ἐκεῖ ἐν τῇ τρυμαλιᾷ τῆς πέτρας.
**5** Καὶ ἐπορεύθην, καὶ ἔκρυψα αὐτὸ ἐν τῷ Εὐφράτῃ, καθὼς ἐνετείλατό μοι Κύριος.
**6** Καὶ ἐγένετο μεθ᾿ ἡμέρας πολλάς, καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς μέ· ἀνάστηθι, καὶ βάδισον ἐπὶ τὸν Εὐφράτην, καὶ λάβε ἐκεῖθεν τὸ περίζωμα, ὃ ἐνετειλάμην σοι τοῦ κατακρύψαι ἐκεῖ.
**7** Καὶ ἐπορεύθην ἐπὶ τὸν Εὐφράτην ποταμόν, καὶ ὤρυξα, καὶ ἔλαβον τὸ περίζωμα ἐκ τοῦ τόπου, οὗ κατώρυξα αὐτὸ ἐκεῖ, καὶ ἰδοὺ διεφθαρμένον ἦν, ὃ οὐ μὴ χρησθῇ εἰς οὐδέν.
**8** Καὶ ἐγενήθη λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς μέ, λέγων·
**9** τάδε λέγει Κύριος· Οὕτως φθερῶ τὴν ὕβριν Ἰούδα καὶ τὴν ὕβριν Ἱερουσαλήμ, τὴν πολλὴν ταύτην ὕβριν,
**10** τὸν λαὸν τοῦτον τὸν πονηρόν, τοὺς μὴ βουλομένους ὑπακούειν τῶν λόγων μου, καὶ πορευομένους ἐν τῇ εὐθύτητι τῆς καρδίας αὐτῶν τῆς πονηρᾶς, καὶ πορευθέντας ὀπίσω θεῶν ἀλλοτρίων τοῦ δουλεύειν αὐτοῖς, καὶ τοῦ προσκυνεῖν αὐτοῖς· καὶ ἔσονται ὥσπερ τὸ περίζωμα τοῦτο, ὃ οὐ μὴ χρησθήσεται εἰς οὐδέν.
**11** Ὅτι καθάπερ κολλᾶται τὸ περίζωμα περὶ τὴν ὀσφῦν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου, οὕτως ἐκόλλησα πρὸς ἐμαυτὸν τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ πάντα τὸν οἶκον Ἰούδα, φησὶ Κύριος, τοῦ γενέσθαι μοι εἰς λαὸν ὀνομαστόν, καὶ εἰς καύχημα καὶ εἰς δόξαν, καὶ οὐκ ἤκουσαν μου.
**12** Καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς τὸν λαὸν τὸν λόγον τοῦτον· τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ· πᾶς ἀσκὸς πληρωθήσεται οἴνου· καὶ ἔσται ἐὰν εἴπωσι πρὸς σέ, μὴ γνόντες οὐ γνωσόμεθα, ὅτι πᾶς ἀσκὸς πληρωθήσεται οἴνου;
**13** Καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτούς· τάδε λέγει Κύριος· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ πληρῶ πάντας τοὺς κατοικοῦντας τὴν γῆν ταύτην, καὶ τοὺς βασιλεῖς αὐτῶν τοὺς καθημένους υἱοὺς τοῦ Δαυὶδ ἐπὶ θρόνου αὐτῶν, καὶ τοὺς ἱερεῖς καὶ τοὺς προφήτας, καὶ τὸν Ἰούδα καὶ πάντας τοὺς κατοικοῦντας ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ μεθύσματι·
**14** καὶ διασκορπιῶ αὐτοὺς ἄνδρα καὶ τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοὺς πατέρας αὐτῶν, καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτῶν ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ·

### JEREMIAH 13

**1** THUS saith the Lord unto me: "Go, and acquire thee a linen girdle, and put it about thy loins, and thou shalt not let it pass through water."
**2** So I acquired the girdle according to the word of the Lord, and I put it about my loins.
**3** And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
**4** "Take the girdle that thou hast acquired, which is about thy loins, and arise, and go to the Euphrates, and hide it there in the cleft of the rock."
**5** So I went, and hid it by the Euphrates, as the Lord had commanded me.
**6** And it came to pass after many days, that the Lord said unto me, "Arise, and go to the Euphrates, and take thence the girdle, which I commanded thee to hide there."
**7** And I went to the river Euphrates, and I dug, and took the girdle from the place where I had buried it there; and behold, it was corrupted, which could serve for nought.
**8** Then the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
**9** "Thus saith the Lord: Even so will I mar the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem,
**10** even this wicked people, who refuse to hearken unto My words, and walk in the straightness of their evil heart, and have gone after strange gods to serve them, and to worship them; and they shall be as this girdle, which can serve for nought."
**11** "For as the girdle cleaveth unto the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave unto Me the house of Israel and all the house of Judah," saith the Lord, "that they might be unto Me for a people renowned, and for a boast, and for a glory; but they hearkened not unto Me."
**12** "And thou shalt say unto this people, 'Thus saith the Lord God of Israel: Every wineskin shall be filled with wine.' And it shall come to pass, if they say unto thee, being ignorant, 'Do we not know that every wineskin shall be filled with wine?'"
**13** "Then shalt thou say unto them, 'Thus saith the Lord: Behold, I will fill all them that dwell in this land, even the kings that sit upon David's throne, and the priests and the prophets, and Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.
**14** And I will scatter them, even man and his brother, and their fathers and their sons, all together."
