Ἀγαθὸν ἀνδρί, ὅταν ἄρῃ ζυγὸν ἐν νεότητι αὐτοῦ, καθήσεται 27: 28
κατὰ μόνας, καὶ σιωπήσεται, ὅτι ἦρεν ἐφ᾿ ἑαυτῷ.
Ἰώδ.
Δώσει τῷ παίοντι αὐτὸν σιαγόνα, χορτασθήσεται ὀνειδισμῶν, 29
ὅτι οὐκ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα ἀπώσεται Κύριος.
Χάφ.
Ὅτι δ᾽ ἐταπείνωσας οἰκτειρήσει κατὰ τὸ πλῆθος τοῦ ἐλέους αὐτοῦ, 31
οὐκ ἀπεκρίθη ἀπὸ καρδίας αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐταπείνωσεν υἱοὺς ἀνδρός. 32
Λάμεδ.
Τοῦ ταπεινῶσαι ὑπὸ τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ πάντας δεσμίους γῆς, 33
τοῦ ἐκκλίναι κρίσιν ἀνδρὸς κατέναντι προσώπου ὑψίστου, κατα- 34: 35
δικᾶσαι ἄνθρωπον ἐν τῷ κρίνεσθαι αὐτὸν Κύριος οὐκ εἶπε. Τίς 36
οὕτως εἶπε, καὶ ἐγενήθη; Κύριος οὐκ ἐνετείλατο, ἐκ στόματος 37
ὑψίστου οὐκ ἐξελεύσεται τὰ κακὰ καὶ τὸ ἀγαθόν.
Μήμ.
Τί γογγύσει ἄνθρωπος ζῶν, ἀνὴρ περὶ τῆς ἁμαρτίας αὐτοῦ ; 38
Νοῦν.
Ἐξερευνήθη ἡ ὁδὸς ἡμῶν, καὶ ἠτάσθη, καὶ ἐπιστρέψωμεν ἕως 39
τοῦ Κυρίου. Ἀναλάβωμεν τὰς καρδίας ἡμῶν ἐπὶ χειρῶν πρὸς 40
ὑψηλὸν ἐν οὐρανῷ. Ἡμαρτήσαμεν, ἠσεβήσαμεν, καὶ οὐχ ἱλάσθης. 41
Σάμεχ.
Ἐπεσκέπασας ἐν θυμῷ, καὶ ἀπεδίωξας ἡμᾶς, ἀπέκτεινας, καὶ 42
οὐκ ἐφείσω. Ἐπεσκέπασας νεφέλην σεαυτῷ εἵνεκεν προσευχῆς, 43
καμμύσαι με καὶ ἀπωσθῆναι, 44
Ἄϊν.
Ἔθηκας ἡμᾶς ἐν μέσω τῶν λαῶν, διήνοιξαν ἐφ᾿ ἡμᾶς στόμα 45: 46
αὐτῶν πάντες οἱ ἐχθροὶ ἡμῶν. Φόβος καὶ θυμὸς ἐγενήθη ἡμῖν,
ἔπαρσις καὶ συντριβή. Ἀφέσεις ὑδάτων κατάξει ὁ ὀφθαλμός μου 47
ἐπὶ τὸ σύντριμμα τῆς θυγατρὸς τοῦ λαοῦ μου.
Φῆ.
Ὁ ὀφθαλμός μου κατεπόθη, καὶ οὐ σιωπήσομαι τοῦ μὴ εἶναι ἐκνήψιν, 48
ἕως οὗ διακύψῃ καὶ ἴδῃ Κύριος ἐξ οὐρανοῦ. Ὁ ὀφθαλμός μου 49:50
ἐπιφυλλιεῖ ἐπὶ τὴν ψυχήν μου παρὰ πάσας θυγατέρας πόλεως.
Τσαδή.
Θηρεύοντες ἐθήρευσάν με ὡς στρουθίον, οἱ ἐχθροί μου δωρεάν 51

### Chapter III.

**Gamma.**

**Heth.**
**27** Good is it for a man, that he should bear a yoke in his youth.
**28** He shall sit alone and be silent, for he hath taken it upon himself.

**Yodh.**
**29** He shall give his cheek to him that smiteth him; he shall be filled with reproaches,
**30** for the Lord shall not cast [him] off forever.

**Kaph.**
**31** For though He hath brought low, yet shall He have compassion according to the multitude of His mercy.
**32** He did not answer [from] His heart, when He humbled the sons of man.

**Lamedh.**
**33** To humble under His feet all the prisoners of the earth,
**34** to turn aside the right of a man before the face of the Most High,
**35** to condemn a man when he is judged—the Lord did not speak [such things].
**36** Who hath thus spoken, and it came to pass? The Lord hath not commanded [it];
**37** from the mouth of the Most High shall not proceed forth the evils and the good.

**Mem.**
**38** Why should a living man complain, yea, a man concerning his sin?

**Nun.**
**39** Our way hath been searched out and examined; yea, let us return unto the Lord.
**40** Let us lift up our hearts upon [our] hands unto the Most High in heaven.
**41** We have sinned, and have been impious, and Thou hast not been appeased.

**Samekh.**
**42** Thou hast covered [us] in wrath, and hast driven us away; Thou hast slain, and Thou hast not spared.
**43** Thou hast covered Thyself with a cloud for the sake of prayer,
**44** [so] that I might be shut off and thrust away.

**Ayin.**
**45** Thou hast made us to be in the midst of the peoples;
**46** all our enemies have opened their mouth against us.
**47** Fear and wrath have become ours, [even] pride and crushing.
**48** My eye shall bring down streams of waters upon the crushing of the daughter of my people.

**Pe.**
**49** My eye is swallowed up, and I shall not be silent so that there be no ceasing,
**50** until the Lord shall look down and behold from heaven.
**51** My eye shall sprout leaves upon my soul, more than all the daughters of the city.

**Tsade.**
**52** They that hunted have hunted me as a sparrow, [even] my enemies without cause.
