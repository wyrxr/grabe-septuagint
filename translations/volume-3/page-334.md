οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος· ἰδοὺ ὡς ἀετὸς ὁρμήσει, καὶ ἐκπετάσει τὰς
41 πτέρυγας αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ Μωάβ. Ἐλήφθη Ἀκκαριώθ, καὶ τὰ ὀχυρώ-
ματα συνελήφθη· καὶ ἔσται ἡ καρδία τῶν δυναστῶν Μωάβ ἐν
42 τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ὡς καρδία γυναικὸς ὠδινούσης. Καὶ ἀπολεῖται
43 Μωάβ ἀπὸ ὄχλου, ὅτι ἐπὶ τὸν Κύριον ἐμεγαλύνθη. Παγὶς καὶ
44 φόβος καὶ βόθυνος ἐπὶ σὲ καθήμενος ἐπὶ Μωάβ, φησὶ Κύριος. Ὁ
φεύγων ἀπὸ προσώπου τοῦ φόβου ἐμπεσεῖται εἰς τὸν βόθυνον· καὶ
ὁ ἀναβαίνων ἐκ τοῦ βοθύνου, συλληφθήσεται ἐν τῇ παγίδι· διότι
ἐπάξω ταῦτα ἐπὶ Μωάβ, ἐν ἐνιαυτῷ ἐπισκέψεως αὐτῶν, φησὶ
45 Κύριος. Ἐν σκιᾷ Ἑσεβὼν ἐστάθησαν ἀπὸ δυνάμεως φυγόντες,
ὅτι πῦρ ἐξῆλθεν ἀπὸ Ἑσεβών, καὶ φλὸξ ἀπὸ μέσου Σεών,
καὶ κατέφαγε τὸ κλίτος Μωάβ, καὶ τὴν κορυφὴν υἱῶν Σαών.
46 Οὐαί σοι, Μωάβ, ἀπώλετο λαὸς Χαμώς, ὅτι ἔλαβον τοὺς υἱούς
47 σου, καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας σου εἰς αἰχμαλωσίαν. Καὶ ἐπιστρέψω
αἰχμαλωσίαν τοῦ Μωάβ ἐν ταῖς ἐσχάταις ἡμέραις· λέγει Κύριος.
Ἔως τούτου τὸ κρίμα τοῦ Μωάβ.

15 ΟΣΑ ἐπροφήτευσεν Ἱερεμίας ἐπὶ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη)· ὅτι οὕτως εἶπε
Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς μέ· λάβε τὸ ποτήριον τοῦ οἴνου τοῦ
ἀκράτου τούτου ἐκ χειρός μου, καὶ ποτιεῖς αὐτὸ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη,
16 πρὸς ἃ ἐγὼ ἀποστέλλω σε πρὸς αὐτούς, καὶ πίονται, καὶ ἐξεμοῦν-
ται, καὶ μανήσονται ἀπὸ προσώπου τῆς μαχαίρας, ἧς ἐγὼ ἀποστέλλω
ἀναμέσον αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἔλαβον τὸ ποτήριον ἐκ χειρὸς Κυ-
ρίου, καὶ ἐπότισα πάντα τὰ ἔθνη, πρὸς ἃ ἀπέστειλέ με Κύριος
18 πρὸς αὐτά, τὴν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ τὰς πόλεις Ἰούδα, καὶ βασιλεῖς
Ἰούδα καὶ ἄρχοντας αὐτοῦ, τοῦ θεῖναι αὐτὰς εἰς ἐρήμωσιν, καὶ
εἰς ἄβατον, καὶ εἰς συριγμόν, καὶ εἰς κατάραν κατὰ τὴν ἡμέραν
19 ταύτην, καὶ τὸν Φαραὼ βασιλέα Αἰγύπτου, καὶ τοὺς παῖδας αὐ-
20 τοῦ, καὶ τοὺς μεγιστᾶνας αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντα τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ
πάντας τοὺς συμμίκτους αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντας τοὺς βασιλεῖς γῆς
Οὐζ, καὶ πάντας τοὺς βασιλεῖς γῆς (πάντων τῶν) ἀλλοφύλων,
καὶ τὴν Ἀσκάλωνα, καὶ τὴν Γάζαν, καὶ τὴν Ἀκκαρών, καὶ τὸ

**Jeremiah, Chapter 31**

**40** Thus saith the Lord: Behold, he shall swoop down like an eagle, and shall spread forth his wings upon Moab.
**41** Kirioth is taken, and the strongholds are seized; and the heart of the mighty men of Moab in that day shall be as the heart of a woman in travail.
**42** And Moab shall perish from the multitude, because he hath magnified himself against the Lord.
**43** A snare, and fear, and a pit are upon thee, O dweller in Moab, saith the Lord.
**44** He that fleeth from the face of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare; for I will bring these things upon Moab, in the year of their visitation, saith the Lord.
**45** Under the shadow of Heshbon stood they that fled from the might [of the foe]; for fire hath come forth from Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and it hath devoured the side of Moab, and the crown of the sons of Shaon.
**46** Woe unto thee, O Moab! The people of Chemosh are destroyed; for they have taken thy sons and thy daughters into captivity.
**47** Yet will I turn again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, saith the Lord. Thus far is the judgment of Moab.

**Jeremiah, Chapter 32**
(Corresponding to Hebrew Chapter 25, verses 15 to the end)

**15** [Concerning] that which Jeremiah prophesied against all the nations: For thus spake the Lord, the God of Israel, unto me: "Take this cup of undiluted wine from My hand, and cause all the nations to drink thereof,
**16** unto whom I send thee; and they shall drink, and shall vomit, and shall be mad, because of the presence of the sword which I send among them."
**17** And I took the cup from the hand of the Lord, and I caused all the nations to drink, unto whom the Lord sent me,
**18** even Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings of Judah, and its princes, to make them a desolation, and an uninhabited waste, and a hissing, and a curse, as it is this day;
**19** and Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and his servants,
**20** and his great ones, and all his people, and all his mixed multitude; and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the foreigners (even all of them), and Ashkelon, and Gaza, and Ekron, and the
**21** remnant of Ashdod; and Edom, and Moab, and
