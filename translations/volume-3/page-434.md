8 μου ἐπὶ σε, καὶ δώσω σε εἰς διαρπαγὴν ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι, καὶ ἐξολεθρεύσω σε ἐκ τῶν λαῶν, καὶ ἀπολῶ σε ἐκ τῶν χωρῶν ἀπωλεία, καὶ ἐπιγνώσῃ διότι ἐγὼ Κύριος. Τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναῖ Κύριος˙ ἀνθ᾿ ὧν εἶπε Μωὰβ καὶ Σηείρ, ἰδοὺ, ὃν τρόπον πάντα τὰ ἔθνη, ὁ οἶκος Ἰσραὴλ καὶ Ἰούδα,
9 διὰ τοῦτο ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ παραλύω τὸν ὦμον Μωὰβ ἀπὸ τῶν πόλεων, ἀπὸ πόλεων ἀκρωτηρίων αὐτοῦ, ἐκλεκτὴν γῆν, οἶκον Ἰασιμοὺθ ἐπάνω πηγῆς πόλεως παραθαλασσίας,
10 τοὺς υἱοὺς Κεδὲμ ἐπὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἀμμὼν δέδωκα αὐτῷ εἰς κληρονομίαν, ὅπως
11 μὴ γένηται μνεία τῶν υἱῶν Ἀμμὼν ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι. Καὶ ἐν Μωὰβ
12 ποιήσω ἐκδίκησιν, καὶ ἐπιγνώσονται διότι ἐγὼ Κύριος. Τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναῖ Κύριος˙ ἀνθ᾿ ὧν ἐποίησεν ἡ Ἰδουμαία ἐν τῷ ἐκδικῆσαι αὐτοὺς ἐκδίκησιν εἰς τὸν οἶκον Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐμνησικάκησαν,
13 καὶ ἐξεδίκησαν δίκην, διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναῖ Κύριος˙ καὶ ἐκτενῶ τὴν χεῖρά μου ἐπὶ τὴν Ἰδουμαίαν, καὶ ἐξολεθρεύσω ἐξ αὐτῆς ἄνθρωπον καὶ κτῆνος, καὶ θήσομαι αὐτὴν ἔρημον˙ καὶ ἐκ Θαι-
14 μὰν διωκόμενοι ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ πεσοῦνται, καὶ δώσω τὴν ἐκδίκησίν μου ἐπὶ τὴν Ἰδουμαίαν ἐν χειρὶ λαοῦ μου Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ποιήσουσιν ἐν τῇ Ἰδουμαίᾳ κατὰ τὴν ὀργήν μου καὶ κατὰ τὸν θυμόν μου,
15 καὶ ἐπιγνώσονται τὴν ἐκδίκησίν μου, λέγει Ἀδωναῖ Κύριος. Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναῖ Κύριος˙ ἀνθ᾿ ὧν ἐποίησαν οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι ἐν ἐκδικήσει, καὶ ἐξανέστησαν ἐκδίκησιν, ἐπιχαίροντες ἐκ
16 ψυχῆς τοῦ ἐξαλεῖψαι ἕως αἰῶνος, διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναῖ Κύριος˙ ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐκτενῶ τὴν χεῖρά μου ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀλλοφύλους, καὶ ἐξολεθρεύσω Κρῆτας, καὶ ἀπολῶ τοὺς καταλοίπους τοὺς κατοικοῦντας τὴν παραθαλασσίαν.
17 Καὶ ποιήσω ἐν αὐτοῖς ἐκδικήσεις μεγάλας ἐν ἐλεγμοῖς θυμοῦ, καὶ ἐπιγνώσονται διότι ἐγὼ Ἀδωναῖ Κύριος, ἐν τῷ δοῦναί με τὴν ἐκδίκησίν μου ἐπ᾿ αὐτούς.

ΚΕΦ. ΚϚ΄. XXVI.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἐνδεκάτῳ ἔτει, μιᾷ τοῦ μηνὸς τοῦ πρώτου, ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς μέ, λέγων˙
2 υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, ἀνθ᾿ ὧν
3 εἶπε Σὸρ ἐπὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ, εὖγε, συνετρίβη, ἀπόλωλε τὰ ἔθνη,
4 ἐπεστράφη πρὸς μέ, ἡ πλήρης ἠρήμωται. Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει
5 Ἀδωναῖ Κύριος˙ ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐπὶ σὲ Σὸρ, καὶ ἀναδέξω ἐπὶ σὲ ἔθνη

**Chapter 25**

**8** My hand upon thee, and I shall deliver thee for a spoil unto the nations; and I shall cut thee off from among the peoples, and I shall utterly destroy thee from the lands, [even] to thy utter destruction; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord.
Thus saith Adonai the Lord: "Forasmuch as Moab and Seir have said, 'Behold, the house of Israel and Judah are as all the nations,'
**9** therefore, behold, I shall break open the shoulder of Moab from his cities, [even] from his border cities, [and] his choicest land, the house of Iasimouth which is above the spring of a city by the sea.
**10** The sons of Kedem, [to be set] over the sons of Ammon, have I given unto him for an inheritance,
**11** that there should be no more remembrance of the sons of Ammon among the nations. And in Moab
**12** I shall execute vengeance, and they shall know that I am the Lord." Thus saith Adonai the Lord: "Forasmuch as Edom did execute vengeance with a vengeance against the house of Judah, and did bear a grudge,
**13** and exacted punishment; therefore thus saith Adonai the Lord: I shall stretch forth My hand upon Edom, and I shall cut off from her man and beast, and I shall make her desolate. And from Teman
**14** they that are pursued shall fall by the sword; and I shall lay My vengeance upon Edom by the hand of My people Israel; and they shall do in Edom according to My wrath and according to My fury,
**15** and they shall know My vengeance," saith Adonai the Lord.
Therefore thus saith Adonai the Lord: "Forasmuch as the Philistines have wrought vengeance, and have stirred up vengeance, rejoicing with
**16** their soul to utterly destroy [them] forever; therefore thus saith Adonai the Lord: Behold, I shall stretch forth My hand upon the Philistines, and I shall utterly destroy the Caphtorim, and I shall cause to perish the remnant that
**17** dwell by the seacoast. And I shall execute among them great vengeances with rebukes of wrath; and they shall know that I am Adonai the Lord, when I shall lay My vengeance upon them."

**Chapter 26**

**1** AND it came to pass in the eleventh year, on the first [day] of the first month, that the word of the Lord came unto me, saying:
**2** "Son of man, forasmuch as
**3** Tyre hath said concerning Jerusalem, 'Aha! It is broken, the nations are destroyed;
**4** it is turned unto me, the full [city] is laid waste!' Therefore thus saith
**5** Adonai the Lord: 'Behold, I am against thee, O Tyre; and I shall bring up against thee nations"
