βασιλείας Χαναὰν καὶ ἔδωκε τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν κληρονομίαν, κληρονομίαν 12
τῷ Ἰσραὴλ λαῷ αὐτοῦ. Κύριε τὸ ὄνομά σου εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, 13
Κύριε τὸ μνημόσυνόν σου εἰς γενεὰν καὶ γενεάν· ὅτι κρινεῖ Κύριος 14
τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπὶ τοῖς δούλοις αὐτοῦ παρακληθήσεται. Τὰ 15
εἴδωλα τῶν ἐθνῶν ἀργύριον, καὶ χρυσίον, ἔργα χειρῶν ἀνθρώπων·
στόμα ἔχουσι, καὶ οὐ λαλήσουσιν· ὀφθαλμοὺς ἔχουσι, καὶ οὐκ ὄψον- 16
ται· ὦτα ἔχουσι, καὶ οὐκ ἐνωτισθήσονται· (ῥῖνας ἔχουσι, καὶ οὐκ 17
ὀσφρανθήσονται·) (χεῖρας ἔχουσι, καὶ οὐ ψηλαφήσουσι·) (πόδας
ἔχουσι, καὶ οὐ περιπατήσουσιν·) (οὐ φωνήσουσιν ἐν τῷ λάρυγγι
αὐτῶν·) οὐδὲ γάρ ἐστι πνεῦμα ἐν τῷ στόματι αὐτῶν. Ὅμοιοι αὐ- 18
τοῖς γένοιντο (πάντες) οἱ ποιοῦντες αὐτά, καὶ πάντες οἱ πεποιθό-
τες ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῖς. Οἶκος Ἰσραὴλ εὐλογήσατε τὸν Κύριον· οἶκος Ἀα- 19
ρὼν εὐλογήσατε τὸν Κύριον· οἶκος Λευεὶ εὐλογήσατε τὸν Κύριον· 20
οἱ φοβούμενοι τὸν Κύριον εὐλογήσατε τὸν Κύριον. Εὐλογητὸς Κύ- 21
ριος ἐκ Σιών, ὁ κατοικῶν Ἱερουσαλήμ.

ΨΑΛΜ. ΡΛΕ΄. CXXXV.

ΑΛΛΗΛΟΥΪΑ. Ἐξομολογεῖσθε τῷ Κυρίῳ, ὅτι χρηστός· ὅτι 1
εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ. Ἐξομολογεῖσθε τῷ Θεῷ τῶν θεῶν· 2
ὅτι εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ. Ἐξομολογεῖσθε τῷ Κυρίῳ τῶν 3
Κυρίων· ὅτι εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ. Τῷ ποιήσαντι θαυμά- 4
σια μεγάλα μόνῳ· ὅτι εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ. Τῷ ποιή- 5
σαντι τοὺς οὐρανοὺς ἐν συνέσει· ὅτι εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ.
Τῷ στερεώσαντι τὴν γῆν ἐπὶ τῶν ὑδάτων· ὅτι εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τὸ 6
ἔλεος αὐτοῦ· τῷ ποιήσαντι φῶτα μεγάλα (μόνῳ)· ὅτι εἰς τὸν αἰῶ- 7
να τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ· τὸν ἥλιον εἰς ἐξουσίαν τῆς ἡμέρας· ὅτι εἰς τὸν 8
αἰῶνα τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ· τὴν σελήνην καὶ τὰ ἄστρα εἰς ἐξουσίαν τῆς 9
νυκτός· ὅτι εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ. Τῷ πατάξαντι Αἴγυ- 10
πτον σὺν τοῖς πρωτοτόκοις αὐτῶν· ὅτι εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τὸ ἔλεος αὐ-
τοῦ· καὶ ἐξαγαγόντι τὸν Ἰσραὴλ ἐκ μέσου αὐτῶν· ὅτι εἰς τὸν 11
αἰῶνα τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ· ἐν χειρὶ κραταιᾷ καὶ ἐν βραχίονι ὑψηλῷ· 12
ὅτι εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ. Τῷ καταδιελόντι τὴν ἐρυθρὰν 13
θάλασσαν εἰς διαιρέσεις· ὅτι εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ· καὶ 14
διαγαγόντι τὸν Ἰσραὴλ διὰ μέσου αὐτῆς· ὅτι εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τὸ
ἔλεος αὐτοῦ· καὶ τῷ ἐκτινάξαντι Φαραὼ καὶ τὴν δύναμιν αὐτοῦ 15

**PSALM 134 (LXX 134) - *continued***

**11** and all the kingdoms of Canaan,
   and gave their land for an inheritance,
**12** an inheritance to Israel His people.
**13** O Lord, Thy Name endureth for ever;
   O Lord, Thy memorial is unto generation and generation.
**14** For the Lord will judge His people,
   and upon His servants shall He have compassion.
**15** The idols of the Gentiles are silver and gold,
   the works of men's hands;
**16** They have a mouth, but they shall not speak;
   eyes have they, but they shall not see;
**17** ears have they, but they shall not hear;
   (noses have they, but they shall not smell;)
   (hands have they, but they shall not feel;)
   (feet have they, but they shall not walk;)
   (they shall not speak with their throat;)
   for neither is there breath in their mouth.
**18** Like unto them shall become (all) they that make them,
   and all they that put their trust in them.
**19** O house of Israel, bless ye the Lord;
   O house of Aaron, bless ye the Lord;
**20** O house of Levi, bless ye the Lord;
   ye that fear the Lord, bless ye the Lord.
**21** Blessed be the Lord out of Zion,
   who dwelleth in Jerusalem.
