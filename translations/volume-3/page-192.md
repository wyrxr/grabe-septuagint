1130 Η Σ Α Ι Α Σ. ΚΕΦ. Ε´.
οἶκος τοῦ Ἰσραήλ ἐστι, καὶ ἄνθρωπος τοῦ Ἰούδα νεόφυτον ἠγα-
πημένον· ἔμεινα τοῦ ποιῆσαι κρίσιν, ἐποίησε δὲ ἀνομίαν, καὶ οὐ
8 δικαιοσύνην, ἀλλὰ κραυγήν. Οὐαὶ οἱ συνάπτοντες οἰκίαν πρὸς οἰ-
κίαν, καὶ ἀγρὸν πρὸς ἀγρὸν ἐγγίζοντες, ἵνα τοῦ πλησίον ἀφέλων-
9 ται τι· μὴ οἰκήσητε μόνοι ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς; Ἠκούσθη γὰρ εἰς τὰ ὦτα
Κυρίου Σαβαὼθ ταῦτα· ἐὰν γὰρ γένωνται οἰκίαι πολλαί, εἰς ἔρημον
10 ἔσονται μεγάλαι καὶ καλαί, καὶ οὐκ ἔσονται οἱ ἐνοικοῦντες. Οὐ
γὰρ ἐργῶνται δέκα ζεύγη βοῶν, ποιήσει κεράμιον ἕν, καὶ ὁ σπείρων
11 ἀρτάβας ἓξ, ποιήσει μέτρα τρία. Οὐαὶ οἱ ἐγειρόμενοι τοπρωΐ, καὶ
τὸ σίκερα διώκοντες, οἱ μένοντες τὸ ὀψέ· ὁ γὰρ οἶνος αὐτοὺς συγ-
12 καύσει· μετὰ γὰρ κιθάρας καὶ ψαλτηρίου καὶ τυμπάνων καὶ αὐ-
λῶν τὸν οἶνον πίνουσι, τὰ δὲ ἔργα Κυρίου οὐκ ἐμβλέπουσι, καὶ
13 τὰ ἔργα τῶν χειρῶν αὐτοῦ οὐ κατανοοῦσι. Τοίνυν αἰχμάλωτος ὁ
λαός μου ἐγενήθη, διὰ τὸ μὴ εἰδέναι αὐτοὺς τὸν Κύριον, καὶ πλῆθος
14 ἐγενήθη νεκρῶν διὰ λιμὸν καὶ δίψαν ὕδατος· καὶ ἐπλάτυνεν ὁ ᾅδης
τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ, καὶ διήνοιξε τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ, τοῦ μὴ διαλιπεῖν,
15 καὶ καταβήσονται οἱ ἔνδοξοι καὶ οἱ μεγάλοι καὶ οἱ πλούσιοι καὶ
οἱ λοιμοὶ αὐτῆς· καὶ ταπεινωθήσεται ἄνθρωπος, καὶ ἀτιμασθή-
16 σεται ἀνήρ, καὶ οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ οἱ μετέωροι ταπεινωθήσονται· καὶ
ὑψωθήσεται Κύριος Σαβαὼθ ἐν κρίσει, καὶ ὁ Θεὸς ὁ ἅγιος δο-
17 ξασθήσεται ἐν δικαιοσύνῃ· καὶ βοσκηθήσονται οἱ διηρπασμένοι ὡς
ταῦροι, καὶ τὰς ἐρήμους τῶν ἀπειλημμένων ἄρνες φάγονται. Οὐαὶ
18 οἱ ἐπισπώμενοι τὰς ἁμαρτίας ὡς σχοινίῳ μακρῷ, καὶ ὡς ζυγοῦ
19 ἱμάντι δαμάλεως τὰς ἀνομίας, οἱ λέγοντες· τὸ τάχος ἐγγισάτω
ἃ ποιήσει, ἵνα ἴδωμεν, καὶ ἔλθοι ἡ βουλὴ τοῦ ἁγίου Ἰσραήλ,
20 ἵνα γνῶμεν. Οὐαὶ οἱ λέγοντες τὸ πονηρὸν καλόν, καὶ τὸ καλὸν
πονηρόν, οἱ τιθέντες τὸ σκότος φῶς, καὶ τὸ φῶς σκότος, οἱ τι-
21 θέντες τὸ πικρὸν γλυκύ, καὶ τὸ γλυκὺ πικρόν. Οὐαὶ οἱ συνετοὶ
22 ἐν ἑαυτοῖς, καὶ ἐνώπιον ἑαυτῶν ἐπιστήμονες. Οὐαὶ οἱ ἰσχύοντες
ὑμῶν, οἵ τὸν οἶνον πίνοντες, καὶ οἱ δυνάσται οἱ κεραννύντες τὸ
23 σίκερα· οἱ δικαιοῦντες τὸν ἀσεβῆ ἕνεκεν δώρων, καὶ τὸ δίκαιον
24 τοῦ δικαίου αἴροντες ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ. Διὰ τοῦτο ἐν τρόπῳ καυθήσεται
καλάμη ὑπὸ ἄνθρακος πυρός, καὶ συγκαυθήσεται ὑπὸ φλογὸς
ἀνειμμένης, ἡ ῥίζα αὐτῶν ὡς χνοῦς ἔσαι, καὶ τὸ ἄνθος αὐτῶν ὡς
25 κονιορτὸς ἀναβήσεται· οὐ γὰρ ἠθέλησαν τὸν νόμον Κυρίου Σα-
βαὼθ, ἀλλὰ τὸ λόγιον τοῦ ἁγίου Ἰσραὴλ παρώξυναν. Καὶ ἐθυ-

**7** [is] the house of Israel,
And the man of Judah is His beloved planting;
I waited for it to bring forth judgment, but it brought forth iniquity,
And not righteousness, but an outcry.

**8** Woe unto them that join house to house,
And bring field near to field,
That they may take somewhat unto themselves from their neighbor.
Shall ye dwell alone upon the earth?
**9** For these things were heard in the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth:
If many houses come to be,
They shall become great and fair, but unto desolation,
And there shall be none to dwell therein.
**10** For if ten yokes of oxen labor, it shall yield but one jar [of wine];
And he that soweth six artabae, shall bring forth three measures.

**11** Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning,
And pursue strong drink, who remain until late evening,
For wine shall consume them.
**12** For with harp and lyre, with timbrels and flutes,
They drink wine; but they look not upon the works of the Lord,
Neither do they consider the works of His hands.
**13** Therefore, my people is gone into captivity,
Because they knew not the Lord;
And a multitude of dead did come to be by reason of famine and thirst for water.
**14** And Hades hath enlarged its gullet, and opened wide its mouth, without ceasing;
And down shall go her glorious ones, and her great ones, and her rich ones,
And her base ones.
**15** And man shall be humbled, and man shall be dishonored;
**16** And the haughty eyes shall be brought low.
And the Lord of Sabaoth shall be exalted in judgment,
And the Holy God shall be glorified in righteousness.
**17** And the plundered ones shall be pastured as bulls,
And lambs shall eat the desolations of those that have been taken away.

**18** Woe unto them that draw iniquity upon them as with a long rope,
And lawless deeds as with the harness-strap of a heifer;
**19** Who say, "Let His work make haste and draw near, that we may see it!
And let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel come, that we may know it!"
**20** Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil;
That put darkness for light, and light for darkness;
That put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!
**21** Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes,
And prudent in their own sight!
**22** Woe unto you that are mighty, who drink wine;
And ye powerful men who mix strong drink;
**23** Who justify the wicked for the sake of gifts,
And take away the just cause of the righteous from him.
**24** Therefore, in like manner as stubble is burned up by a coal of fire,
And consumed by an unbridled flame,
Their root shall be as chaff, and their blossom shall ascend as dust;
For they desired not the law of the Lord of Sabaoth,
**25** But they provoked the oracle of the Holy One of Israel.
And the wrath of the Lord of Sabaoth was kindled against His people,
