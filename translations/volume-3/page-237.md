ΚΕΦ. ΛΘ´. XXXIX.

Ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ ἀπέστειλε Μαρωδὰχ Βαλαδὰν υἱὸς τοῦ Βαλαδάν, ὁ βασιλεὺς τῆς Βαβυλωνίας ἐπιστολὰς καὶ πρέσβεις καὶ δῶρα Ἑζεκίᾳ· ἤκουσε γὰρ, ὅτι ἐμαλακίσθη ἕως θανάτου·
καὶ ἀνέστη, καὶ ἐχάρη ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῖς Ἑζεκίας χαρὰν μεγάλην, καὶ ἔδειξεν αὐτοῖς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ νεχωθᾶ, καὶ τῆς στακτῆς, καὶ τῶν θυμιαμάτων, καὶ τοῦ μύρου, καὶ τοῦ ἀργυρίου, καὶ τοῦ χρυσίου, καὶ πάντας τοὺς οἴκους τῶν σκευῶν τῆς γάζης, καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἦν ἐν τοῖς θησαυροῖς αὑτοῦ· καὶ οὐκ ἦν οὐδὲν ὃ οὐκ ἔδειξεν αὐτοῖς Ἑζεκίας ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ αὑτοῦ, καὶ ἐν πάσῃ τῇ ἐξουσίᾳ αὑτοῦ.
Καὶ ἦλθεν Ἠσαΐας ὁ προφήτης πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Ἑζεκίαν, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτόν· τί λέγουσιν οἱ ἄνθρωποι οὗτοι; καὶ πόθεν ἥκασι πρὸς σέ; καὶ εἶπεν Ἑζεκίας· ἐκ γῆς πόρρωθεν ἥκασι πρὸς με ἐκ Βαβυλῶνος.
Καὶ εἶπεν Ἠσαΐας· τί ἴδον ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ σου; καὶ εἶπεν Ἑζεκίας· πάντα τὰ ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ μου ἴδοσαν, καὶ οὐκ ἔστι πρᾶγμα ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ μου, ὃ οὐκ ἴδοσαν, ἀλλὰ καὶ τὰ ἐν τοῖς θησαυροῖς μου.
Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Ἠσαΐας· ἄκουσον τὸν λόγον Κυρίου Σαβαώθ.
Ἰδοὺ ἡμέραι ἔρχονται, λέγει Κύριος, καὶ λήψονται πάντα τὰ ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ σου, καὶ ὅσα συνήγαγον οἱ πατέρες σου ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης, εἰς Βαβυλῶνα ἥξει, καὶ οὐ μὴ καταλείπωσιν οὐδέν· εἶπε δὲ ὁ Θεός.
Ὅτι καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν τέκνων σου ὧν γεννήσεις, λήψονται καὶ ποιήσουσι σπάδοντας ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ βασιλέως τῶν Βαβυλωνίων.
Καὶ εἶπεν Ἑζεκίας πρὸς Ἠσαΐαν· ἀγαθὸς ὁ λόγος Κυρίου ὃν ἐλάλησε, γενέσθω δὴ εἰρήνη καὶ δικαιοσύνη ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις μου.

ΚΕΦ. Μ´. XL.

ΠΑΡΑΚΑΛΕΙΤΕ, παρακαλεῖτε τὸν λαόν μου, λέγει ὁ Θεός· ἱερεῖς, λαλήσατε εἰς τὴν καρδίαν Ἱερουσαλὴμ, παρακαλέσατε αὐτὴν, ὅτι ἐπλήσθη ἡ ταπείνωσις αὐτῆς, λέλυται αὐτῆς ἡ ἁμαρτία, ὅτι ἐδέξατο ἐκ χειρὸς Κυρίου διπλᾶ τὰ ἁμαρτήματα αὐτῆς.
Φωνὴ βοῶντος ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου,

#### Chapter 39

**1** At that time, Marodach Baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and envoys and gifts unto Hezekiah; for he had heard that he had been sick unto death.
**2** And Hezekiah arose, and rejoiced with great joy at their coming, and showed them the house of the *nechothah*, and of the spice, and of the incense, and of the ointment, and of the silver, and of the gold, and all the chambers of the vessels of the treasury, and all that was in his own treasuries; and there was nothing which Hezekiah showed them not in his house, and in all his own dominion.
**3** Then came Isaiah the prophet unto King Hezekiah, and said unto him, "What say these men? And from whence have they come unto thee?" And Hezekiah said, "From a far land have they come unto me, even from Babylon."
**4** And Isaiah said, "What saw they in thine house?" And Hezekiah answered, "All things that are in my house they did see; and there is no thing in my house which they saw not, yea, and all that is in my treasuries."
**5** Then Isaiah said unto him, "Hearken unto the word of the Lord Sabaoth.
**6** Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that all things that are in thine house, and all that thy fathers have gathered until this day, shall be carried unto Babylon; and they shall leave nothing behind. Yea, God Himself hath spoken it.
**7** For also from thy children whom thou shalt beget, shall they take, and they shall make them eunuchs in the house of the king of the Babylonians."
**8** Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, "Good is the word of the Lord which he hath spoken. Let there be, I pray, peace and righteousness in my days."

#### Chapter 40

**1** COMFORT YE, comfort ye My people, saith God. Ye priests, speak ye to the heart of Jerusalem; comfort her, for her humiliation is fulfilled, and her sin is loosed, for she hath received from the hand of the Lord double for her sins.
**3** A voice of one crying in the wilderness: "Prepare ye the way of the Lord!"
