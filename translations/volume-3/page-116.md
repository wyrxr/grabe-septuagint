1054 ΨΑΛΤΗΡΙΟΝ. ΥΜΝ. Βʹ.
μὴ μακροχρονίσωσι, καὶ ἵνα μὴ συνεπίθωνται οἱ ὑπεναντίοι, μὴ
εἴπωσιν· ἡ χεὶρ ἡμῶν ὑψηλὴ, καὶ οὐχὶ Κύριος ἐποίησε ταῦτα πάν-
28 τα. Ὅτι ἔθνος ἀπολωλεκὸς βουλὴν ἐστι, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν αὐτοῖς
29 ἐπιστήμη, οὐκ ἐφρόνησαν συνιέναι ταῦτα· καταδεξάσθωσαν εἰς τὸν
30 ἐπιόντα χρόνον. Πῶς διώξεται εἷς χιλίους, καὶ δύο μετακινήσου-
σι μυριάδας; εἰ μὴ ὁ Θεὸς ἀπέδοτο αὐτοὺς, καὶ ὁ Κύριος παρ-
31 ἔδωκεν αὐτούς. Οὐ γὰρ εἰσὶν οἱ θεοὶ αὐτῶν ὡς ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν· οἱ
32 δὲ ἐχθροὶ ἡμῶν ἀνόητοι. Ἐκ γὰρ ἀμπέλου Σοδόμων ἡ ἄμπελος αὐ-
τῶν, καὶ ἡ κληματὶς αὐτῶν ἐκ Γομόῤῥας· ἡ σταφυλὴ αὐτῶν σταφυλὴ
33 χολῆς, βότρυς πικρίας αὐτοῖς· θυμὸς δρακόντων ὁ οἶνος αὐτῶν, καὶ
34 θυμὸς ἀσπίδων ἀνίατος. Οὐχὶ ταῦτα (πάντα) συνήκται παρ᾿ ἐμοὶ,
35 καὶ ἐσφράγισται ἐν τοῖς θησαυροῖς μου; Ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ἐκδικήσεως ἀντα-
ποδώσω, ἐν καιρῷ ὅταν σφαλῇ ὁ ποὺς αὐτῶν· ὅτι ἐγγὺς ἡμέρα ἀπω-
36 λείας αὐτῶν, καὶ πάρεσιν ἕτοιμα ὑμῖν. Ὅτι κρινεῖ Κύριος τὸν λαὸν
αὑτοῦ, καὶ ἐπὶ τοῖς δούλοις αὑτοῦ παρακληθήσεται· ἴδε γὰρ αὐ-
τοὺς παραλελυμένους, καὶ ἐκλελοιπότας ἐν ἀπαγωγῇ, καὶ παρειμέ-
37 νους. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος· ποῦ εἰσὶν οἱ θεοὶ αὐτῶν, ἐφ᾿ οἷς ἐπεποίθεισαν
38 ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῖς; Ὧν τὸ στέαρ τῶν θυσιῶν αὐτῶν ἐσθίετε, καὶ ἐπίνετε
τὸν οἶνον τῶν σπονδῶν αὐτῶν· ἀναστήτωσαν καὶ βοηθησάτωσαν
39 ὑμῖν, καὶ γενηθήτωσαν ὑμῖν σκεπασταί. Εἴδετε εἴδετε ὅτι ἐγὼ
εἰμι, καὶ οὐκ ἔστι Θεὸς πλὴν ἐμοῦ· ἐγὼ ἀποκτενῶ, καὶ ζῆν ποιή-
σω· πατάξω, κἀγὼ ἰάσομαι· καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ὃς ἐκ τῶν χειρῶν μου
40 ἐξαιρούμενος. Ὅτι ἀρῶ εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν τὴν χεῖρά μου, καὶ ὁμοῦ-
41 μαι τῇ δεξιᾷ μου, καὶ ἐρῶ· Ζῶ ἐγὼ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα· ὅτι παροξυνῶ
ὡς ἀστραπὴν τὴν μάχαιράν μου, καὶ ἀνθέξεται κρίματος ἡ χείρ
μου, (καὶ ἐκδικήσει), καὶ ἀνταποδώσω δίκην τοῖς ἐχθροῖς μου, καὶ
42 τοῖς μισοῦσί με ἀνταποδώσω. Μεθύσω τὰ βέλη μου ἀφ᾿ αἵματος,
καὶ ἡ μάχαιρά μου καταφάγεται κρέα, ἀφ᾿ αἵματος τραυματιῶν
43 καὶ αἰχμαλωσίας, ἀπὸ κεφαλῆς ἀρχόντων ἐχθρῶν. Εὐφράνθητε
οὐρανοὶ ἅμα αὐτῷ, καὶ προσκυνησάτωσαν αὐτῷ πάντες οἱ ἄγγε-
λοι Θεοῦ· εὐφράνθητε ἔθνη μετὰ τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐνισχυσά-
τωσαν αὐτῷ πάντες υἱοὶ Θεοῦ· ἔτι τὸ αἷμα τῶν υἱῶν αὑτοῦ ἐκδι-
κεῖται, καὶ ἐκδικήσει, καὶ ἀνταποδώσει δίκην τοῖς ἐχθροῖς αὐτοῦ,
καὶ τοῖς μισοῦσιν ἀνταποδώσει δίκην· καὶ ἐκκαθαριεῖ Κύριος τὴν
γῆν τοῦ λαοῦ αὑτοῦ.

**The Second Ode: The Song of Moses in Deuteronomy [continued].**

**27** ...lest they should prolong [their triumph],
    and lest the adversaries should combine [against them],
    lest they should say, "Our hand is high,
    and the Lord hath not done all these things."
**28** For it is a nation void of counsel,
    and there is no understanding in them;
    they have not considered to comprehend these things.
**29** Let them but receive [their due] for the time to come.
**30** How shall one pursue a thousand,
    and two put ten thousands to flight?
    Save that their God hath sold them,
    and the Lord hath delivered them up.
**31** For their gods are not as our God;
    our enemies themselves are senseless.
**32** For their vine is from the vine of Sodom,
    and their stock from Gomorrah;
    their grapes are grapes of gall,
**33** a cluster of bitterness unto them;
    their wine is the venom of dragons,
    and the incurable poison of asps.
**34** Are not these [all] things laid up by Me,
**35** and sealed in My treasuries?
    In the day of vengeance I shall make recompense,
    in the season when their foot shall stumble;
    for the day of their perdition is nigh,
**36** and the things prepared are at hand for you.
    For the Lord shall judge His people,
    and for His servants shall He be entreated;
    for He saw them utterly broken,
    and having failed in captivity, and cast down.
**37** And the Lord said, "Where are their gods,
**38** in whom they did put their trust?
    Whose fat of their sacrifices ye did eat,
    and the wine of their libations ye did drink.
    Let them arise and help you,
**39** and let them become your protectors."
    "See, ye, see that I am He,
    and there is no God save Me;
    I kill, and I make alive;
    I smite, and I heal;
    and there is none who can deliver out of My hands.
**40** For I shall lift up My hand unto heaven,
**41** and I shall swear by My right hand, and I shall say,
    'I live for ever!'
    For I shall sharpen My sword as lightning,
    and My hand shall lay hold on judgment, [and it shall take vengeance];
    and I shall render recompense unto Mine enemies,
**42** and to them that hate Me shall I repay.
    I shall make My arrows drunk with blood,
    and My sword shall devour flesh;
    from the blood of the wounded and of the captives,
    from the head of the chief of the enemy."
**43** Rejoice, O heavens, together with Him,
    and let all the angels of God worship Him;
    rejoice, O nations, with His people,
    and let all the sons of God strengthen Him.
    For the blood of His sons is yet avenged, and He shall avenge [it];
    and He shall render vengeance unto His enemies,
    and to them that hate [Him] shall He render vengeance;
    and the Lord shall thoroughly cleanse the land of His people.
