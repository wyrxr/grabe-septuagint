1216 ΙΕΡΕΜΙΑΣ ΚΕΦ. Β΄. Γ΄.
25 ζητοῦντες αὐτὴν οὐ κοπιάσουσιν, ἐν τῇ ταπεινώσει αὐτῆς εὑ-
    ρήσουσιν αὐτήν. ᾿Απόστρεψον τὸν πόδα σου ἀπὸ ὁδοῦ τραχείας,
    καὶ τὸν φάρυγγά σου ἀπὸ δίψους· ἡ δὲ εἶπεν, ἀνδριοῦμαι· ὅτι
26 ἠγαπήκει ἀλλοτρίους, καὶ ὀπίσω αὐτῶν ἐπορεύετο. Ὡς αἰσχύνη
    κλέπτου, ὅταν ἁλῷ, οὕτως αἰσχυνθήσονται οἱ υἱοὶ ᾿Ισραήλ, αὐ-
    τοί καὶ οἱ βασιλεῖς αὐτῶν, καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες αὐτῶν, καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς
27 αὐτῶν, καὶ οἱ προφῆται αὐτῶν. Τῷ ξύλῳ εἶπαν, ὅτι πατήρ μου
    εἶ σύ, καὶ τῷ λίθῳ, σὺ ἐγέννησάς με· καὶ ἔστρεψαν ἐπ᾿ ἐμὲ
    νῶτα, καὶ οὐ πρόσωπα αὐτῶν· καὶ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ τῶν κακῶν αὐ-
28 τῶν ἐροῦσιν, ἀνάστα καὶ σῶσον ἡμᾶς. Καὶ ποῦ εἰσιν οἱ θεοί σου,
    οὓς ἐποίησας σεαυτῷ ; εἰ ἀναστήσονται καὶ σώσουσι σε ἐν καιρῷ
    τῆς κακώσεώς σου; ὅτι κατὰ ἀριθμὸν τῶν πόλεών σου ἦσαν
    θεοί σου ᾿Ιούδα, καὶ κατὰ ἀριθμὸν διόδων τῆς ῾Ιερουσαλὴμ ἔθυσον
29 τῇ Βάαλ. ᾿Ινατί λαλεῖτε πρός με ; πάντες ὑμεῖς ἠνομήσατε εἰς
30 ἐμέ, λέγει Κύριος. Μάτην ἐπάταξα τὰ τέκνα ὑμῶν, παιδείαν
    οὐκ ἐδέξασθε, μάχαιρα κατέφαγε τοὺς προφήτας ὑμῶν ὡς λέων
31 ὀλεθρεύων, καὶ οὐκ ἐφοβήθητε. ᾿Ακούσατε τὸν λόγον Κυρίου· τάδε
    λέγει Κύριος· μὴ ἔρημος ἐγενόμην τῷ ᾿Ισραήλ, ἢ γῆ κεχερσω-
    μένη ; διατὶ εἶπεν ὁ λαός μου, οὐ δουλευθησόμεθα, καὶ οὐχ ἥξο-
32 μεν πρὸς σὲ ἔτι ; Μὴ ἐπιλήσεται νύμφη τὸν κόσμον αὐτῆς, καὶ
    παρθένος τὴν στηθοδεσμίδα αὐτῆς ; ὁ δὲ λαός μου ἐπελάθετό μου
33 ἡμέρας, ὧν οὐκ ἔστιν ἀριθμός. Τί ἔτι καλὸν ἐπιτηδεύσεις ἐν
    ταῖς ὁδοῖς σου, τοῦ ζητῆσαι ἀγάπησιν ; οὐχ οὕτως· ἀλλὰ καὶ
34 σὺ ἐπονηρεύσω τοῦ μιᾶναι τὰς ὁδούς σου, καὶ ἐν ταῖς χερσί σου
    εὑρέθη αἵματα ψυχῶν ἀθώων· οὐκ ἐν διορύγμασιν εὗρον αὐτούς,
35 ἀλλ᾿ ἐπὶ πάσῃ δρυῒ. Καὶ εἶπας· ἀθῶός εἰμι, ἀλλὰ ἀποστραφήτω
    ὁ θυμὸς αὐτοῦ ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ κρίνομαι πρός σε, ἐν τῷ λέ-
36 γειν σε, οὐχ ἥμαρτον, ὅτι κατεφρόνησας σφόδρα τοῦ δευτερώσαι
    τὰς ὁδούς σου· καὶ ἀπὸ Αἰγύπτου καταισχυνθήσῃ, καθὼς κατη-
    σχύνθης ἀπὸ ᾿Ασσοῦρ, ὅτι καὶ ἐντεῦθεν ἐξελεύσῃ, καὶ αἱ χεῖρές σου
    ἐπὶ τῆς κεφαλῆς σου· ὅτι ἀπώσατο Κύριος τὴν ἐλπίδα σου, καὶ
    οὐκ εὐοδωθήσῃ ἐν αὐτῇ.

ΚΕΦ. Γ΄. ΙΙΙ

1 ΕΑΝ ἐξαποστείλῃ ἀνὴρ τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀπέλθῃ ἀπ᾿
    αὐτοῦ, καὶ γένηται ἀνδρὶ ἑτέρῳ, μὴ ἀνακάμπτουσα ἀνακάμψει

**25** They that seek her shall not grow weary; in her abasement shall they find her. Turn thou thy foot from the rough way, and thy throat from thirst. But she said, 'I will be resolute'; for she had loved strangers, and after them did she walk.
**26** As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so shall the children of Israel be put to shame: they, and their kings, and their princes, and their priests, and their prophets;
**27** Who said unto the wood, 'Thou art my father,' and to the stone, 'Thou hast begotten me.' For they turned their backs unto Me, and not their faces; and in the time of their calamity shall they say, 'Arise, and save us!'
**28** But where are thy gods that thou hast made for thyself? Will they arise and save thee in the time of thy distress? For according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah, and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem did they sacrifice to Baal.
**29** Wherefore do ye contend with Me? All of you have transgressed against Me," saith the Lord.
**30** "In vain have I smitten your children; ye have received no instruction. The sword hath devoured your prophets as a destroying lion, and ye were not afraid.
**31** Hear ye the word of the Lord. Thus saith the Lord: Have I been a wilderness unto Israel, or a land laid waste? Why hath My people said, 'We will not serve, and we will no longer come unto Thee?'
**32** Will a bride forget her ornaments, or a virgin her girdle? Yet My people have forgotten Me for days without number.
**33** How wilt thou yet adorn thy ways to seek love? Nay, not thus; but thou also hast done wickedly to defile thy ways,
**34** And in thy hands was found the blood of innocent souls. I found them not in hidden places, but upon every oak.
**35** Yet thou saidst, 'I am innocent; let His wrath turn from me.' Behold, I will contend with thee, because thou sayest, 'I have not sinned.'
**36** Because thou hast scorned greatly to renew thy ways. And from Egypt shalt thou be put to shame, as thou wast put to shame from Assyria. For even from thence shalt thou go forth, and thy hands upon thy head; for the Lord hath cast off thy hope, and thou shalt not prosper therein.

### Chapter 3

**1** If a man shall send away his wife, and she depart from him, and become another man’s, shall she return to him again? Shall not that land be utterly defiled? Yet thou hast played the harlot with many shepherds, and didst return unto Me," saith the Lord.
