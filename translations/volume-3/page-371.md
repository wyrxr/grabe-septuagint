οὓς διεσπάρησαν ῥῆσαν ἐκεῖ, τοῦ κατοικεῖν ἐν τῇ γῇ Ἰούδα, τοὺς δυνατοὺς ἄνδρας, 6
καὶ τὰς γυναῖκας, καὶ τὰ νήπια καὶ τὰ λοιπά, καὶ τὰς θυγατέ-
ρας τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ πάσας τὰς ψυχὰς ἃς κατέλιπε Ναβουζαρδὰν
ὁ ἀρχιμάγειρος μετὰ Γοδολίου υἱοῦ Ἀχικάμ υἱοῦ Σαφάν, καὶ
Ἱερεμίαν τὸν προφήτην, καὶ Βαροὺχ υἱὸν Νηρίου, καὶ εἰσῆλθον 7
εἰς Αἴγυπτον, ὅτι οὐκ ἤκουσαν τῆς φωνῆς Κυρίου, καὶ εἰσῆλθον
εἰς Τάφνας. Καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς Ἱερεμίαν ἐν Τά- 8
φνας, λέγων· λάβε σεαυτῷ λίθους μεγάλους, καὶ κατάκρυψον 9
αὐτοὺς ἐν τῷ κρυφίῳ ἐν προθύροις ἐν πύλῃ τῆς οἰκίας Φαραὼ ἐν
Τάφνας, κατ᾿ ὀφθαλμοὺς ἀνδρῶν Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτούς· 10
οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος τῶν δυνάμεων ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ
ἀποστέλλω, καὶ ἄξω Ναβουχοδονόσορ βασιλέα Βαβυλῶνος τὸν
δοῦλόν μου, καὶ θήσει αὐτοῦ τὸν θρόνον ἐπάνω τῶν λίθων τού-
των ὧν κατέκρυψας, καὶ ἀρεῖ τὰ ὅπλα αὐτοῦ ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς, καὶ 11
εἰσελεύσεται, καὶ πατάξει γῆν Αἰγύπτου, οὓς εἰς θάνατον εἰς θά-
νατον, καὶ οὓς εἰς ἀποικισμὸν εἰς ἀποικισμὸν, καὶ οὓς εἰς ῥομ-
φαίαν εἰς ῥομφαίαν. Καὶ καύσει πῦρ ἐν οἰκίαις θεῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ 12
ἐμπυριεῖ αὐτὰς, καὶ ἀποικιεῖ αὐτοὺς, καὶ φθειρεῖ γῆν Αἰγύπτου,
ὥσπερ φθειρίζει ὁ ποιμὴν τὸ ἱμάτιον αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐξελεύσεται ἐκεῖ-
θεν ἐν εἰρήνῃ, καὶ συντρίψει τοὺς στύλους Ἡλιουπόλεως, τοὺς 13
ἐν ὧν, καὶ τὰς οἰκίας θεῶν αὐτῶν κατακαύσει ἐν πυρί.

Ο ΛΟΓΟΣ Ο ΓΕΝΟΜΕΝΟΣ ΠΡΟΣ ΙΕΡΕΜΙΑΝ ἅπατι τοῖς 1
Ἰουδαίοις τοῖς κατοικοῦσιν ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ καὶ τοῖς καθημένοις
ἐν Μαγδωλῷ, καὶ ἐν Τάφνας, καὶ ἐν Μέμφει, καὶ ἐν γῇ Παθού-
ρῃς, λέγων· οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ· ὑμεῖς ἑωράκατε 2
πάντα τὰ κακὰ, ἃ ἐπήγαγον ἐπὶ Ἱερουσαλὴμ, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς πό-
λεις Ἰούδα· καὶ ἰδοὺ εἰσὶν ἔρημοι τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ταύτῃ ἀπὸ ἐνοι-

με, πορευθέντες θυμιᾶν καὶ λατρεύειν θεοῖς ἑτέροις, οἷς
οὐκ ἔγνωτε αὐτοὶ ὑμεῖς, καὶ οἱ πατέρες ὑμῶν. Καὶ ἀπέστειλα 4
πρὸς ὑμᾶς τοὺς δούλους πάντας μου τοὺς προφήτας ὄρθρου, καὶ
ἀπέστειλα ἐγὼ πρὸς ὑμᾶς, λέγων, μὴ ποιήσητε τὸ πρᾶγμα τῆς

**JEREMIAH 50**

**5** ...whom they had scattered, they burst forth there, to dwell in the land of Judah, [even] the mighty men,
**6** and the women, and the children and the rest, and the daughters of the king, and all the souls whom Nebuzaradan the chief of the executioners had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah.
**7** And they entered into Egypt, because they hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord; and they entered into Tahpanhes.
**8** Then the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying:
**9** "Take unto thyself great stones, and hide them in the secret place, in the entrance, in the gate of Pharaoh's house in Tahpanhes, before the eyes of the men of Judah.
**10** And thou shalt say unto them: 'Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I send and shall bring Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, My servant; and he shall set his throne upon these stones which thou hast hidden,
**11** and he shall set his royal canopy upon them. And he shall enter and shall strike the land of Egypt: those [appointed] to death, to death; and those [appointed] to captivity, to captivity; and those [appointed] to the sword, to the sword.
**12** And he shall burn fire in the houses of their gods, and shall set them ablaze, and shall carry them away captive, and shall lay waste the land of Egypt, even as a shepherd cleanses his garment of vermin. And he shall go forth thence in peace,
**13** and shall break in pieces the pillars of Heliopolis, those in of which, and shall burn with fire the houses of their gods.'"

**CHAPTER 51**

**1** The word which came unto Jeremiah concerning every [one of] the Jews who abide in the land of Egypt, and those residing in Migdol, and in Tahpanhes, and in Memphis, and in the land of Pathros, saying:
**2** "Thus saith the Lord God of Israel: Ye yourselves have seen all the evils which I have brought upon Jerusalem and upon the cities of Judah; and behold, they are a desolation this day, without inhabitants,
**3** because of the wickedness of them, by which they provoked Me to wrath, in that they went to burn incense and to serve other gods, whom neither ye yourselves knew, nor your fathers.
**4** And I sent unto you all My servants the prophets, rising early, and sent them unto you, even I myself, saying, 'Do not this abominable thing,' "
