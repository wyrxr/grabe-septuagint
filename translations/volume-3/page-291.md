⁴ πεποίθητε, ὅτι πᾶς ἀδελφὸς πτέρνῃ πτερνιεῖ, καὶ πᾶς φίλος δολίως
⁵ πορεύσεται. Ἕκαστος κατὰ τοῦ φίλου ἑαυτοῦ καταπαίξεται, ἀλή-
θειαν οὐ μὴ λαλήσουσι· μεμάθηκεν ἡ γλῶσσα αὐτῶν λαλεῖν ψευδῆ,
⁶ ἠδίκησαν, καὶ οὐ διέλιπον τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι. Τόκος ἐπὶ τόκῳ, καὶ δόλος
ἐπὶ δόλῳ· οὐκ ἤθελον εἰδέναι με, φησὶ Κύριος. ⁷ Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει
Κύριος· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ πυρώσω αὐτοὺς, καὶ δοκιμῶ αὐτούς· ὅτι ποιήσω ἀπὸ
⁸ προσώπου πονηρίας θυγατρὸς λαοῦ μου. Βολὶς τιτρώσκουσα ἡ
γλῶσσα αὐτῶν, δόλια τὰ ῥήματα τοῦ στόματος αὐτῶν· τῷ πλη-
⁹ σίον αὐτοῦ λαλεῖ εἰρηνικά, καὶ ἐν ἑαυτῷ ἔχει τὴν ἔχθραν. Μὴ
ἐπὶ τούτοις οὐκ ἐπισκέψομαι, λέγει Κύριος, ἢ ἐν λαῷ τοιούτῳ
¹⁰ οὐκ ἐκδικήσει ἡ ψυχή μου; Ἐπὶ τὰ ὄρη λάβετε κοπετὸν καὶ
μέλος, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς τρίβους τῆς ἐρήμου θρῆνον, ὅτι ἐξέλιπον παρὰ
¹¹ τὸ μὴ εἶναι ἀνθρώπους παραπορευομένους· οὐκ ἤκουσαν φωνὴν
ὑπάρξεως ἀπὸ πετεινῶν τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ ἕως τῶν κτηνῶν, ἐξέ-
στησαν, ᾤχοντο. Καὶ δώσω τὴν Ἱερουσαλὴμ εἰς μετοικίαν καὶ
¹² εἰς κατοικητήριον δρακόντων, καὶ τὰς πόλεις Ἰούδα εἰς ἀφανισμὸν
θήσομαι, παρὰ τὸ μὴ κατοικεῖσθαι. Τίς ὁ ἄνθρωπος ὁ συνετὸς,
καὶ συνίεται τοῦτο; καὶ ὁ λόγος στόματος Κυρίου πρὸς αὐ-
¹³ τὸν, ἀναγγειλάτω ἡμῖν, τίνος ἕνεκεν ἀπώλετο ἡ γῆ, ἀνήφθη,
ὡς ἔρημος παρὰ τὸ μὴ διοδεύεσθαι; Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς μὲ,
¹⁴ διὰ τὸ ἐγκαταλιπεῖν αὐτοὺς τὸν νόμον μου, ὃν ἔδωκα πρὸ προ-
σώπου αὐτῶν, καὶ οὐκ ἤκουσαν τῆς φωνῆς μου, καὶ οὐχ ὤδευ-
σαν ἐν αὐτῇ, ἀλλ’ ἐπορεύθησαν ὀπίσω τῶν ἀρεστῶν τῆς καρδίας
¹⁵ αὐτῶν τῆς κακῆς, καὶ ὀπίσω τῶν εἰδώλων, ἃ ἐδίδαξαν αὐτοὺς οἱ
πατέρες αὐτῶν. Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ·
¹⁶ ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ψωμίζω αὐτοὺς αὐτοὺς ἀνάγκας, καὶ ποτιῶ αὐτοὺς ὕδωρ
Χολῆς, καὶ διασκορπιῶ αὐτοὺς ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν, εἰς οὓς οὐκ ἐγί-
¹⁷ νωσκον αὐτοὶ καὶ οἱ πατέρες αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπαποστελῶ ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς
τὴν μάχαιραν, ἕως τοῦ ἐξαναλῶσαι αὐτοὺς ἐν αὐτῇ. Τάδε λέ-
¹⁸ γει Κύριος· σύνετε καὶ καλέσατε τὰς θρηνούσας καὶ ἐλθάτωσαν·
καὶ πρὸς τὰς σοφὰς ἀποστείλατε, καὶ φθεγξάσθωσαν, καὶ ταχυ-
¹⁹ νάτωσαν καὶ λαβέτωσαν ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς θρῆνον, καὶ καταγαγέτωσαν οἱ
ὀφθαλμοὶ ὑμῶν δάκρυα, καὶ τὰ βλέφαρα ὑμῶν ῥείτω ὕδωρ, ὅτι

CHAPTER IX.

**4** ...And on your brethren, do not trust; for every brother shall utterly supplant, and every friend shall walk with guile.
**5** Each one shall mock his own friend; they shall not speak the truth. Their tongue hath learned to speak lies; they have dealt wickedly, and have not ceased to turn back.
**6** Usury upon usury, and deceit upon deceit; they were unwilling to know Me, saith the Lord.
**7** Therefore thus saith the Lord: Behold, I shall melt them with fire, and shall test them; for I shall do [this] because of the wickedness of the daughter of My people.
**8** A piercing dart is their tongue; deceitful are the words of their mouth. To his neighbor doth one speak peaceable words, but in his heart he cherisheth enmity.
**9** Shall I not visit them for these things, saith the Lord? Or shall My soul not avenge itself on such a nation?
**10** Upon the mountains take ye up a lamentation and a dirge, and upon the paths of the wilderness a wail; for they are made desolate, so that there are no men passing through. They heard not the sound of living [creatures], neither from the birds of the heaven, nor from the cattle; they are removed, they are gone forth.
**11** And I shall make Jerusalem a desolation and a dwelling place for serpents, and the cities of Judah shall I lay waste, so that they shall not be inhabited.
**12** Who is the man so wise, that he may understand this? And he to whom the word of the Lord's mouth [comes], let him declare unto us, for what cause hath the land perished, and been consumed with fire, like a wilderness, that none passeth through it?
**13** And the Lord spake unto me, saying, "Because they have forsaken My law, which I set before their face, and have not hearkened unto My voice, neither have they walked therein,
**14** but they have walked after the desires of their evil heart, and after the idols which their fathers taught them."
**15** Therefore thus saith the Lord God of Israel: "Behold, I shall feed them, even them, with bitter calamities, and give them water of gall to drink;
**16** and I shall scatter them among the nations, among whom neither they nor their fathers knew; and I shall send the sword after them, until I have utterly consumed them therewith."
**17** Thus saith the Lord: "Consider ye, and call for the wailing women, and let them come; and send for the skillful women, and let them speak forth,
**18** and let them make haste and take up a lamentation for you, and let your eyes bring down tears, and your eyelids pour forth water,
**19** for a voice of lamentation hath been heard in Zion: 'How are we brought low! We are greatly put to shame, because we have forsaken the land, and have cast down our dwellings!'"
**20** Hear ye now, O women, the word of the Lord, and let your ears receive the words of His mouth...
