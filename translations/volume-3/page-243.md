**2** ὕδατος, μετὰ σοῦ εἰμι: καὶ ποταμοὶ οὐ συγκλύσουσί σε: καὶ ἐὰν
διέλθῃς διὰ πυρός, οὐ μὴ κατακαυθῇς, φλὸξ οὐ κατακαύσει σε.
**3** Ὅτι ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου ὁ ἅγιος Ἰσραήλ, ὁ σώζων σε·
ἐποίησά σου ἀλλάγμα Αἴγυπτον καὶ Αἰθιοπίαν, καὶ Σοήνην ὑ-
**4** πὲρ σοῦ. Ἀφ᾿ οὗ ἔντιμος ἐγένου ἐναντίον μου, ἐδοξάσθης, κἀγώ
σε ἠγάπησα, καὶ δώσω ἀνθρώπους πολλοὺς ὑπὲρ σοῦ, καὶ ἄρ-
**5** χοντας ὑπὲρ τῆς κεφαλῆς σου. Μὴ φοβοῦ, ἔτι μετὰ σοῦ εἰμι·
ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν ἄξω τὸ σπέρμα σου, καὶ ἀπὸ δυσμῶν συνάξω σε.
**6** Ἐρῶ τῷ βορρᾷ, ἄγε, καὶ τῷ λίβι, μὴ κώλυε· ἄγε τοὺς υἱούς
μου ἀπὸ τῆς πόῤῥωθεν, καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας μου ἀπ᾿ ἄκρων τῆς
**7** γῆς, πάντας ὅσοι ἐπικέκληνται τῷ ὀνόματί μου· ἐν γὰρ τῇ δό-
ξῃ μου κατεσκεύασα αὐτόν, καὶ ἔπλασα αὐτόν, καὶ ἐποίησα αὐ-
**8** τόν, καὶ ἐξήγαγον λαὸν τυφλόν, καὶ ὀφθαλμοὶ εἰσὶν ὡσαύτως
τυφλοί, καὶ κωφοὶ ὦτα ἔχοντες. Πάντα τὰ ἔθνη συνήχθησαν
**9** ἅμα, καὶ συναχθήσονται ἄρχοντες ἐξ αὐτῶν· τίς ἀναγγελεῖ ταῦτα
ἐν αὐτοῖς; ἢ τὰ ἐξ ἀρχῆς τίς ἀναγγελεῖ ὑμῖν; ἀγαγέτωσαν
τοὺς μάρτυρας αὐτῶν, καὶ δικαιωθήτωσαν, καὶ εἰπάτωσαν ἀ-
**10** ληθῆ, καὶ ἀκουσάτωσαν. γένεσθε μοι μάρτυρες, κἀγὼ μάρτυς,
λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεός, καὶ ὁ παῖς μου ὃν ἐξελεξάμην, ἵνα γνῶτε
καὶ πιστεύσητέ μοι, καὶ συνῆτε ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι· ἔμπροσθέν μου
οὐκ ἐγένετο ἄλλος Θεός, καὶ μετ᾿ ἐμὲ οὐκ ἔσται.
**11** Ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ Θεός, καὶ οὐκ ἔστι πάρεξ ἐμοῦ σώζων.
**12** Ἐγὼ ἀνήγγειλα καὶ ἔσωσα, ὠνείδισα καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἐν ὑμῖν ἀλλότριος· ὑμεῖς
ἐμοὶ μάρτυρες, κἀγὼ μάρτυς, λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεός,
**13** ἔτι ἀπ᾿ ἀρχῆς ἐγώ εἰμι, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ὁ ἐκ τῶν χειρῶν μου ἐξαιρούμενος·
ποιήσω καὶ τίς ἀποστρέψει αὐτό;
**14** Οὕτως λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεός ὁ λυτρούμενος ὑμᾶς, ὁ ἅγιος Ἰσραήλ· ἕνεκεν ὑμῶν ἀποστελῶ
εἰς Βαβυλῶνα, καὶ ἐπεγερῶ πάντας φεύγοντας, καὶ Χαλ-
δαῖοι ἐν πλοίοις δεθήσονται.
**15** Ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ Θεός ὁ ἅγιος ὑμῶν, ὁ καταδείξας Ἰσραὴλ βασιλέα ὑμῶν.
**16** Ὅτι οὕτως λέγει Κύριος ὁ διδούς ὁδὸν ἐν θαλάσσῃ, καὶ ἐν ὕδατι ἰσχυρῷ τρίβον,
**17** ὁ ἐξάγων ἅρματα καὶ ἵππον καὶ ὄχλον ἰσχυρόν· ἀλλὰ ἐκοιμή-
θησαν, καὶ οὐκ ἀναστήσονται, ἐσβέσθησαν ὡς λίνον ἐσβεσμένον.
**18** Μὴ μνημονεύετε τὰ πρῶτα, καὶ τὰ ἀρχαῖα μὴ συλλογίζεσθε.
**19** Ὅτι ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ποιῶ κενά, ἃ νῦν ἀνατελεῖ, καὶ γνώσεσθε αὐτά·
καὶ ποιήσω ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ ὁδόν, καὶ ἐν τῇ ἀνύδρῳ ποταμούς.

#### Chapter 43

**2** ...water, I am with thee;
    and the rivers shall not overwhelm thee.
    And if thou pass through fire,
    thou shalt not be consumed,
    neither shall the flame burn thee.
**3** For I am the Lord thy God,
    the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour;
    I have given Egypt for thy ransom,
    and Ethiopia and Syene for thee.
**4** Since thou hast become precious in My sight,
    thou hast been glorified, and I have loved thee;
    and I will give many men for thee,
    and princes for thy head.
**5** Fear thou not, for I am yet with thee;
    from the east will I bring thy seed,
    and from the west will I gather thee.
**6** I will say to the north, "Bring forth!"
    and to the south, "Hinder not!"
    Bring My sons from afar,
    and My daughters from the ends of the earth,
**7** even all those who are called by My Name.
    For I have fashioned him for My glory,
    and I have formed him, and I have made him.
**8** And I brought forth a people that is blind,
    yet their eyes are likewise blind,
    and their ears are deaf.
**9** All the nations are gathered together,
    and their rulers shall be gathered from among them.
    Who among them shall declare these things?
    Or who shall declare unto you the things from the beginning?
    Let them bring forth their witnesses,
    and let them be justified;
    and let them speak the truth,
    and let them hearken.
**10** "Be ye My witnesses," saith the Lord God,
    "and I am a witness;
    and My servant whom I have chosen,
    that ye may know and believe Me,
    and understand that I am He.
    Before Me there was no other God,
    neither shall there be after Me."
**11** I am God, and there is no saviour besides Me.
**12** I have declared, and I have saved, I have reproached;
    and there was no stranger among you.
    Ye are My witnesses, and I am a witness," saith the Lord God.
**13** "Even from the beginning I am He,
    and there is none that delivereth out of My hand.
    I shall do, and who shall turn it back?"
**14** Thus saith the Lord God, your Redeemer,
    the Holy One of Israel:
    "For your sake I will send unto Babylon,
    and will stir up all the fugitives,
    and the Chaldeans shall be bound in ships."
**15** "I am the Lord your God, the Holy One,
    He that hath appointed Israel your King."
**16** For thus saith the Lord,
    He that maketh a way in the sea,
    and a path in mighty waters;
**17** He that bringeth forth chariots, and horse, and a mighty host:
    but they are fallen asleep, and shall not rise;
    they are extinguished as a quenched wick.
**18** Remember ye not the former things,
    neither consider ye the things of old.
**19** For behold, I make voids,
    which now shall spring forth, and ye shall know them;
    and I will make a way in the wilderness,
    and rivers in the dry land.
