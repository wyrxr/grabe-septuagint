ΚΕΦ. ΙΔʹ.
**1** γεῖσθαι ὑμᾶς λαῷ εἰσακούοντι μάταια ἀποφθέγματα. Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε
**2** λέγει Κύριος Κύριος· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐπὶ τὰ προσκεφάλαια ὑμῶν, ἐφ᾿ ἃ ὑ-
**3** μεῖς συστρέφετε ἐκεῖ ψυχάς· καὶ διαῤῥήξω αὐτὰ ἀπὸ τῶν βραχιό-
**4** νων ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐξαποστελῶ τὰς ψυχάς, ἃς ὑμεῖς ἐκστρέφετε τὰς
**5** ψυχὰς αὐτῶν εἰς διασκορπισμόν, καὶ διαῤῥήξω τὰ περιβόλαια ὑμῶν,
**6** καὶ ῥύσομαι τὸν λαόν μου ἐκ χειρὸς ὑμῶν, καὶ οὐκέτι ἔσονται ἐν
**7** χερσὶν ὑμῖν εἰς συστροφήν· καὶ ἐπιγνώσεσθε, ὅτι ἐγὼ Κύριος. Ἀνθ᾿
**8** ὧν διαστρέφετε καρδίαν δικαίου ἀδίκως· καὶ ἐγὼ οὐ διέστρεφον αὐ-
**9** τόν, καὶ τοῦ κατισχύσαι χεῖρας ἀνόμου, τὸ καθόλου μὴ ἀποστρέ-
**10** ψαι (τὸν) ἀπὸ τῆς ὁδοῦ αὐτοῦ τῆς πονηρᾶς, καὶ ζῆσαι αὐτόν, διὰ
**11** τοῦτο ψευδῆ οὐ μὴ ἴδητε, καὶ μαντείαν οὐ μὴ μαντεύσησθε ἔτι· καὶ
**12** ῥύσομαι τὸν λαόν μου ἐκ χειρὸς ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐπιγνώσεσθε, ὅτι ἐγὼ
**13** Κύριος.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΔʹ. XIV.

**14** ΚΑΙ ἦλθον πρὸς με ἄνδρες ἀπὸ τῶν πρεσβυτέρων Ἰσραήλ, καὶ
**15** ἐκάθισαν πρὸ προσώπου μου. Καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς με,
**16** λέγων· υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, οἱ ἄνδρες οὗτοι ἔθεντο τὰ διανοήματα αὐτῶν
**17** ἐπὶ τὰς καρδίας αὐτῶν, καὶ τὴν κόλασιν τῶν ἀδικιῶν αὐτῶν ἔθη-
**18** καν πρὸ προσώπου αὐτῶν· εἰ ἀποκρινόμενος ἀποκριθῶ αὐτοῖς; Διὰ
**19** τοῦτο λάλησον αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτούς· τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναῖ
**20** Κύριος· ἄνθρωπος ἄνθρωπος ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου Ἰσραήλ, ὃς ἂν θῇ τὰ δια-
**21** νοήματα αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὴν κόλασιν τῆς ἀδι-
**22** κίας αὐτοῦ τάξῃ πρὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔλθῃ πρὸς τὸν προφή-
**23** την, ἐγὼ Κύριος ἀποκριθήσομαι αὐτῷ ἐν οἷς ἐνέχεται ἡ διάνοια
**24** αὐτοῦ, ὅπως μὴ διαστρέψωσι τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ κατὰ τὰς καρ-
**25** δίας αὐτῶν τὰς ἀπηλλοτριωμένας ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ ἐν τοῖς ἐνθυμήμασιν
**26** αὐτῶν. Διὰ τοῦτο εἰπὸν πρὸς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Ἰσραήλ· τάδε λέγει
**27** Κύριος Κύριος ὁ Θεός· ἐπιστράφητε καὶ ἀποστρέψατε ἀπὸ τῶν ἐπι-
**28** τηδευμάτων ὑμῶν, καὶ ἀπὸ πασῶν τῶν ἀσεβειῶν ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐπι-
**29** στρέψατε τὰ πρόσωπα ὑμῶν. Διότι ἄνθρωπος ἄνθρωπος ἐκ τοῦ οἴ-
**30** κου Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐκ τῶν προσηλυτόντων τῶν προσηλυτευόντων ἐν Ἰ-
**31** σραήλ, ὃς ἐὰν ἀπαλλοτριωθῇ ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ, καὶ θῇ τὰ ἐνθυμήματα αὐ-
**32** τοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὴν κόλασιν τῆς ἀδικίας αὐτοῦ
**33** τάξῃ πρὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔλθῃ πρὸς τὸν προφήτην τοῦ ἐπε-
**34** ρωτῆσαι αὐτὸν ἐν ἐμοί, ἐγὼ Κύριος ἀποκριθήσομαι αὐτῷ, ἐν ᾧ ἐνέ-

### Chapter XIV.

**1** ...to utter [prophecies] to a people that listens to vain utterances.
**2** Therefore thus saith the Lord, the Lord: Behold, I am against your cushions, upon which ye ensnare souls;
**3** and I will tear them from your arms, and I will send forth the souls, which ye cause to wander, [even] their souls, unto dispersion.
**5** And I will tear your coverings, and I will deliver My people out of your hand;
**6** and they shall no longer be in your hands for ensnaring.
**7** And ye shall know that I am the Lord.
**8** Forasmuch as ye pervert the heart of the righteous unjustly, and I Myself have not perverted him;
**9** and [forasmuch as ye seek] to strengthen the hands of the lawless, that he should not in any wise turn (him) from his evil way, and live;
**11** therefore ye shall no longer see false [visions], nor shall ye divine any more a divination.
**12** And I will deliver My people out of your hand, and ye shall know that I am the Lord.

### Chapter XIV.

**14** And there came unto me men from among the elders of Israel, and they sat before my face.
**15** And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying:
**16** "Son of man, these men have set their [wicked] thoughts upon their hearts, and the punishment of their iniquities have they placed before their face.
**18** Shall I answer them when they inquire?"
**19** Therefore speak thou unto them, and say unto them:
**20** "Thus saith Adonai the Lord: Every man from the house of Israel who shall set his [wicked] thoughts upon his heart, and shall place the punishment of his iniquity before his face, and shall come unto the prophet,
**23** I the Lord will answer him in the matters wherein his thought is entangled,
**24** so that the house of Israel may not be perverted according to their hearts, which are alienated from Me by their [wicked] thoughts."
**26** Therefore say unto the house of Israel: "Thus saith the Lord, the Lord God:
**27** Turn ye back, and turn away from your practices, and from all your impieties; and turn ye your faces [unto Me].
**29** For every man from the house of Israel, and from among the proselytes, even those who sojourn as proselytes in Israel, whosoever shall be alienated from Me,
**31** and shall set his [wicked] thoughts upon his heart, and shall place the punishment of his iniquity before his face,
**33** and shall come unto the prophet to inquire of him by Me, I the Lord will answer him, in that wherein he is entangled..."
