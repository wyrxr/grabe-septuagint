ΚΕΦ. Γ΄. ΣΟΦΟΝΙΑΣ. 1509
λέγει Κύριος, εἰς ἡμέραν ἀναστάσεώς μου εἰς μαρτύριον· διότι
τὸ κρῖμά μου εἰς συναγωγὰς ἐθνῶν τοῦ εἰσδέξασθαι βασιλεῖς,
τοῦ ἐκχέαι ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς πᾶσαν ὀργὴν θυμοῦ μου· ὅτι ἐν πυρὶ τοῦ
ζήλου μου καταναλωθήσεται ἡ γῆ. Ὅτι τότε μεταστρέψω ἐπὶ 9
λαοὺς γλῶσσαν εἰς γενεὰν αὐτῆς, τοῦ ἐπικαλεῖσθαι πάντας τὸ
ὄνομα Κυρίου, τοῦ δουλεύειν αὐτῷ ὑπὸ ζυγὸν ἕνα· ἐκ περάτων 10
ποταμῶν Αἰθιοπίας προσδέξομαι ἐν διεσπαρμένοις μου, οἴσουσι
θυσίας μοι. Ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ οὐ μὴ καταισχυνθῇς ἐκ πάντων 11
τῶν ἐπιτηδευμάτων σου, ὧν ἠσέβησας εἰς ἐμέ· ὅτι τότε περιελῶ
ἀπὸ σοῦ τὰ φαυλίσματα τῆς ὑβρεώς σου, καὶ οὐκ ἔτι μὴ προσθῇς
τοῦ μεγαλαυχῆσαι ἐπὶ τὸ ὄρος τὸ ἅγιον μου. Καὶ ὑπολείψομαι 12
ἐν σοὶ λαὸν πραΰν καὶ ταπεινόν, καὶ εὐλαβηθήσονται ἀπὸ τοῦ ὀνό-
ματος τοῦ Κυρίου οἱ κατάλοιποι τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ οὐ ποιήσου- 13
σιν ἀδικίαν, οὐδὲ μὴ λαλήσουσι μάταια, καὶ οὐ μὴ εὑρεθῇ ἐν
στόματι αὐτῶν γλῶσσα δολία· διότι αὐτοὶ νεμήσονται καὶ κοι-
τασθήσονται, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ὁ ἐκφοβῶν αὐτούς. Χαῖρε, θύγατερ 14
Σιών, κήρυσσε, θύγατερ Ἱερουσαλήμ, εὐφραίνου, καὶ κατατέρπου
ἐξ ὅλης τῆς καρδίας σου, θύγατερ Ἱερουσαλήμ· περιεῖλε Κύριος 15
τὰ ἀδικήματά σου, λελύτρωταί σε ἐκ χειρὸς ἐχθρῶν σου· βασι-
λεύς Ἰσραὴλ Κύριος ἐν μέσῳ σου, καὶ οὐκ ὄψῃ κακὰ οὐκέτι. Ἐν 16
τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ ἐρεῖ Κύριος τῇ Ἱερουσαλήμ· θάρσει Σιών, μὴ
παρεισδύσωσαν αἱ χεῖρές σου. Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου ἐν σοί, δυνατὸς 17
σώσει σε· ἐπάξει ἐπὶ σὲ εὐφροσύνην, καὶ καινιεῖ σε ἐν τῇ ἀγαπή-
σει αὐτοῦ, καὶ εὐφρανθήσεται ἐπὶ σοὶ ἐν τέρψει, ὡς ἐν ἡμέρᾳ
ἑορτῆς. Καὶ συνάξω τοὺς συντετριμμένους σου· οὐαὶ τίς ἔλα- 18
βεν ὀνειδισμὸν ἐπ᾿ αὐτήν; Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ποιῶ ἐν σοὶ ἕνεκά σου ἐν τῷ 19
καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ, λέγει Κύριος, καὶ σώσω τὴν ἐκπεπιεσμένην, καὶ
τὴν ἀπωσμένην εἰσδέξομαι, καὶ θήσομαι αὐτοὺς εἰς καύχημα,
καὶ ὀνομαστοὺς ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ. Καὶ καταισχυνθήσονται ἐν τῷ 20
καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ, ὅταν καλῶς ὑμῖν ποιήσω, καὶ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ, ὅταν
εἰσδέξομαι ὑμᾶς· διότι δώσω ὑμᾶς ὀνομαστοὺς, καὶ εἰς καύχη-
μα ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς λαοῖς τῆς γῆς, ἐν τῷ ἐπιστρέφειν με τὴν αἰχμα-
λωσίαν ὑμῶν ἐνώπιον ὑμῶν, λέγει Κύριος.

**8** Saith the Lord: For a day of My resurrection, for a witness; for My judgment [is] for the gathering of the nations, that they may receive kings, and that I may pour out upon them all the wrath of My fury; for in the fire of My jealousy shall the whole earth be consumed.

**9** For then will I turn to the peoples a pure language, that all of them may call upon the Name of the Lord, to serve Him with one accord.

**10** From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia shall I receive them among My dispersed ones; they shall bring sacrifices unto Me.

**11** In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy deeds, wherein thou hast transgressed against Me; for then will I take away from the midst of thee the defilers of thy pride, and thou shalt no more again add to boast thyself upon My holy mountain.

**12** And I will leave in thee a people meek and humble, and they shall revere the Name of the Lord, even the remnant of Israel.

**13** They shall commit no iniquity, nor speak vain things; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth; for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid.

**14** Rejoice, O daughter of Zion; proclaim [My word], O daughter of Jerusalem; be glad and delight thyself with all thy heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.

**15** The Lord hath taken away thy injustices, He hath redeemed thee from the hand of thine enemies. The King of Israel, even the Lord, is in the midst of thee; and thou shalt see evil no more.

**16** In that time shall the Lord say to Jerusalem, "Fear not, O Zion; let not thy hands be slack."

**17** The Lord thy God is in the midst of thee, a Mighty One Who shall save thee. He shall bring joy upon thee, and shall renew thee in His love, and shall rejoice over thee with delight, as in a day of feasting.

**18** And I will gather thy broken ones; for woe unto him that hath received reproach on her behalf!

**19** Behold, I will deal with thee for thy sake in that time, saith the Lord, and I will save her that is oppressed, and will receive her that was cast out; and I will make them a praise, and renowned in all the earth.

**20** At that time shall they be put to shame, when I shall deal well with you, and at the time when I shall receive you; for I will make you renowned, and a praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I shall turn back your captivity before your very eyes, saith the Lord.
