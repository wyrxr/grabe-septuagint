στήμης ὢν ἐζήτησε παρ᾽ αὐτῶν δ ὁ βασιλεύς, εὗρεν αὐτοὺς δεκά-
πλασίους, παρὰ πάντας τοὺς ἐπᾳιδοὺς καὶ τοὺς μάγους τοὺς
ὄντας ἐν πάσῃ τῇ βασιλείᾳ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐγένετο Δανιὴλ ἕως ἔτους 21
ἑνὸς Κύρου τοῦ βασιλέως.

       Ἐν τῷ ἔτει τῷ δευτέρῳ τῆς βασιλείας Ναβουχοδονόσορ ἐνυ- 1
πνιάσθη Ναβουχοδονόσορ ἐνύπνιον, καὶ ἐξέστη τὸ πνεῦμα αὐτοῦ,
καὶ ὁ ὕπνος αὐτοῦ ἐγένετο ἀπ᾽ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς κα- 2
λέσαι τοὺς ἐπᾳιδοὺς, καὶ τοὺς μάγους, καὶ τοὺς φαρμακοὺς, καὶ
τοὺς Χαλδαίους, τοῦ ἀναγγεῖλαι τῷ βασιλεῖ τὰ ἐνύπνια αὐτοῦ·
καὶ ἦλθον, καὶ ἔστησαν ἐνώπιον τοῦ βασιλέως. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς ὁ 3
βασιλεύς· Ἡυπνιάσθην, καὶ ἐξέστη τὸ πνεῦμά μου, τοῦ γνῶναι τὸ
ἐνύπνιον. Καὶ ἐλάλησαν οἱ Χαλδαῖοι τῷ βασιλεῖ συριστί· βασιλεῦ, 4
εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας ζῆθι· σὺ εἶπον τὸ ἐνύπνιον τοῖς παισί σου, καὶ
τὴν σύγκρισιν ἀναγγελοῦμεν. Ἀπεκρίθη ὁ βασιλεύς, καὶ εἶπε τοῖς 5
Χαλδαίοις· ὁ λόγος ἀπ᾽ ἐμοῦ ἀπέστη· ἐὰν οὖν μὴ γνωρίσητέ μοι
τὸ ἐνύπνιον καὶ τὴν σύγκρισιν αὐτοῦ, εἰς ἀπώλειαν ἔσεσθε, καὶ οἱ
οἶκοι ὑμῶν διαρπαγήσονται. Ἐὰν δὲ τὸ ἐνύπνιον καὶ τὴν σύγκρισιν 6
αὐτοῦ γνωρίσητέ μοι, δόματα καὶ δωρεὰν καὶ τιμὴν πολλὴν λήψε-
σθε παρ᾽ ἐμοῦ· πλὴν τὸ ἐνύπνιον καὶ τὴν σύγκρισιν αὐτοῦ ἀπαγ-
γείλατέ μοι. Ἀπεκρίθησαν οἱ Χαλδαῖοι ἐκ δευτέρου, καὶ εἶπαν, 7
ὁ βασιλεὺς εἰπάτω τὸ ἐνύπνιον τοῖς παισὶν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὴν σύγκρι-
σιν αὐτοῦ ἀναγγελοῦμεν. Ἀπεκρίθη ὁ βασιλεύς, καὶ εἶπεν· ἐπ᾽ ἀ- 8
ληθείας οἶδα ἐγὼ, ὅτι καιρὸν ὑμεῖς ἐξαγοράζετε· καθότι ἴδετε,
ὅτι ἀπέστη ἀπ᾽ ἐμοῦ τὸ ῥῆμα. Ἐὰν οὖν τὸ ἐνύπνιον μὴ ἀπαγγεί- 9
λητέ μοι, οἶδα ὅτι ῥῆμα ψευδὲς καὶ διεφθαρμένον συνέθεσθε εἰ-
πεῖν ἐνώπιον ἐμοῦ, ἕως οὗ ὁ καιρὸς παρέλθῃ· τὸ ἐνύπνιόν μου
εἴπατέ μοι, καὶ γνώσομαι, ὅτι τὴν σύγκρισιν αὐτοῦ ἀναγγελεῖτέ
μοι. Ἀπεκρίθησαν πάλιν οἱ Χαλδαῖοι ἐνώπιον τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ 10
λέγουσιν· οὐκ ἔστιν ἄνθρωπος ἐπὶ τῆς ξηρᾶς, ὅστις δυνήσεται
τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦ βασιλέως γνωρίσαι, καθότι πᾶς βασιλεὺς μέγας καὶ
ἄρχων ῥῆμα τοιοῦτο οὐκ ἐπερωτᾷ ἐπᾳιδοῦν μάγον καὶ Χαλδαῖον,

...understanding; and when the king did seek [of them this wisdom], he found them tenfold more able than all the enchanters and the magicians who were in all his kingdom.

### Chapter 2

#### The Second Vision

#### The Third Vision

¹ Now in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar did dream a dream, and his spirit was troubled, and his sleep departed from him.
² And the king commanded to call for the enchanters, and the magicians, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, to declare unto the king his dreams; and they came and stood before the king.
³ And the king said unto them, "I dreamed a dream, and my spirit is troubled within me, [for I desire] to know the dream."
⁴ Then spake the Chaldeans unto the king in Aramaic, "O King, live forever! Tell thy servants the dream, and we will declare the interpretation."
⁵ The king answered and said unto the Chaldeans, "The word hath departed from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream and the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.
⁶ But if ye declare unto me the dream and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and a recompense, and great honour: therefore declare unto me the dream and the interpretation thereof."
⁷ They answered a second time and said, "Let the king tell the dream unto his servants, and we will declare the interpretation thereof."
⁸ The king answered and said, "I know of a truth that ye seek to gain time, because ye have seen that the word hath departed from me.
⁹ But if ye will not declare unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for ye have contrived to speak a false and corrupt word before me, until the time shall pass. Tell me therefore my dream, and then shall I know that ye can declare unto me the interpretation thereof."
¹⁰ The Chaldeans answered again before the king, and said, "There is no man upon the earth who can make known the king's matter; inasmuch as no great king or ruler doth ask such a thing of an enchanter, a magician, or a Chaldean;
