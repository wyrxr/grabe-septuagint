τόπος κεχωρισμένος, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς μέ· οὗτος ὁ τόπος ἐστίν, οὗ
ἐψήσουσιν ἐκεῖ οἱ ἱερεῖς τὰ ὑπὲρ τῆς ἀγνοίας καὶ τὰ ὑπὲρ τῆς
ἁμαρτίας, καὶ ἐκεῖ πήξουσι τὸ Μαναὰ τὸ παράπαν τοῦ μὴ ἐκ-
φέρειν εἰς τὴν αὐλὴν τὴν ἐξωτέραν, τοῦ ἁγιάζειν τὸν λαόν. Καὶ
ἐξήγαγέ με εἰς τὴν αὐλὴν τὴν ἐξωτέραν, καὶ περιήγαγέ με ἐπὶ
τὰ τέσσαρα μέρη τῆς αὐλῆς· καὶ ἰδοὺ αὐλὴ, κατὰ τὰ κλίτη τῆς
αὐλῆς αὐλὴ, κατὰ τὸ κλίτος αὐλὴ, ἐπὶ τὰ τέσσαρα κλίτη τῆς
αὐλῆς αὐλὴ, μικρὰ μήκους πήχεων τεσσαράκοντα, καὶ εὖρος πή-
χεων τριάκοντα, μέτρον ἐν ταῖς τέσσαρσι. Καὶ ἐξέδραι κύκλῳ
ἐν αὐταῖς, κύκλῳ ταῖς τέσσαρσι· καὶ μαγειρεῖα γεγονότα ὑπο-
κάτω τῶν ἐξεδρῶν κύκλῳ. Καὶ εἶπε πρός μέ· οὗτοι οἱ οἶκοι
τῶν μαγείρων, οὗ ἐψήσουσιν ἐκεῖ οἱ λειτουργοῦντες τῷ οἴκῳ τὰ
θύματα τοῦ λαοῦ.

ΚΑΙ εἰσήγαγέ με ἐπὶ τὰ πρόθυρα τοῦ οἴκου, καὶ ἰδοὺ ὕδωρ
ἐξεπορεύετο ὑποκάτω τοῦ αἰθρίου τοῦ οἴκου κατ᾿ ἀνατολὰς, ὅτι
τὸ πρόσωπον τοῦ οἴκου ἔβλεπε κατ᾿ ἀνατολὰς, καὶ τὸ ὕδωρ κα-
τέβαινεν ἀπὸ τοῦ κλίτους τοῦ δεξιοῦ, ἀπὸ νότου ἐπὶ τὸ θυ-
σιαστήριον. Καὶ ἐξήγαγέ με κατὰ τὴν ὁδὸν τῆς πύλης τῆς πρὸς
βορρᾶν, καὶ περιήγαγέ με τὴν ὁδὸν ἔξωθεν πρὸς τὴν πύλην τῆς
αὐλῆς τῆς βλεπούσης κατ᾿ ἀνατολὰς· καὶ ἰδοὺ τὸ ὕδωρ κατεφέ-
ρετο ἀπὸ τοῦ κλίτους τοῦ δεξιοῦ, καθὼς ἔξοδος ἀνδρὸς ἐξέναν-
τίας· καὶ μέτρον ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ διεμέτρησε χιλίους ἐν
τῷ μέτρῳ, καὶ διῆλθεν ἐν τῷ μέτρῳ ὕδατι. ὕδωρ ἀφέσεως, καὶ
διεμέτρησεν ἐν τῷ μέτρῳ χιλίους, καὶ διῆλθεν ἐν τῷ ὕδατι ὕδωρ
ἕως τῶν μηρῶν· καὶ διεμέτρησε χιλίους, καὶ διῆλθεν ὕδωρ ἕως
ὀσφύος. Καὶ διεμέτρησε χιλίους χειμάῤῥους, καὶ οὐκ ἠδύνατο
διελθεῖν, ὅτι ἐξύβριζε τὸ ὕδωρ, ὕδωρ ὡς ῥοῖζος χειμάῤῥου, ὃν
οὐ διαβήσονται. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς μέ· εἰ ἑώρακας, υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου;
καὶ ἀπήγαγέ με, καὶ ἐπέστρεψέ με ἐπὶ τὸ χεῖλος τοῦ ποταμοῦ, ἐν
τῇ ἐπιστροφῇ μου· καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐπὶ τοῦ χείλους τοῦ ποταμοῦ δέν-
δρα πολλὰ σφόδρα ἔνθεν καὶ ἔνθεν. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς μέ· τὸ ὕδωρ
τοῦτο τὸ ἐκπορευόμενον εἰς τὴν Γαλιλαίαν τὴν πρὸς ἀνατολὰς,
καὶ κατέβαινεν ἐπὶ τὴν ᾿Αραβίαν, καὶ ἤρχετο ἕως ἐπὶ τὴν θά-
λασσαν ἐπὶ τὸ ὕδωρ τῆς διεκβολῆς, καὶ ὑγιάσει τὰ ὕδατα, καὶ

**Chapter 46**

¹⁹ ...a place set apart. And he said unto me, "This is the place where
²⁰ the priests shall boil there the offerings for [sins of] ignorance and the offerings for sin; and there shall they bake the Man'a [offering] at all, that they may not carry [it] forth into the outer court, to sanctify the people."
²¹ And he brought me forth into the outer court, and he led me round about upon the four sides of the court; and behold, [there was] a court, [and] on the sides of the court, a court, on each side a court, on the four sides
²² of the court, a court, small, its length forty cubits, and its breadth thirty cubits; [such was] the measure in the four of them.
²³ And chambers [were] round about within them, round about the four; and kitchens had been made beneath the chambers round about.
²⁴ And he said unto me, "These are the cooking-houses, where the ministers of the house shall boil there the sacrifices of the people."

**Chapter 47**

¹ AND he brought me back unto the threshold of the house; and behold, water issued forth from under the threshold of the house toward the east, for the forepart of the house looked toward the east; and the water descended from the right side, from the south, unto the altar.
² And he led me out by the way of the gate that looketh toward the north, and he led me round about by the way without unto the gate of the court that looketh toward the east; and behold, the water was coming down from the right side, as the exit of a man opposite.
³ And a measuring-rod [was] in his hand; and he measured a thousand [cubits] by the measure, and he passed through in the water by the measure. [It was] water of release, [reaching only to the ankles].
⁴ And he measured a thousand [cubits] by the measure, and he passed through the water, [which was] water up to the knees. And he measured a thousand [cubits], and he passed through [in] water up to
⁵ the loins. And he measured a thousand torrents, and he was not able to pass through, for the water swelled beyond measure; [it was] water as the roar of a torrent, which none may pass over.
⁶ And he said unto me, "Hast thou seen, O son of man?" And he led me away, and he brought me back to the bank of the river, in
⁷ my returning. And behold, upon the bank of the river [were] very many trees on this side and on that side.
⁸ And he said unto me, "This water, that issueth forth into Galilee toward the east, and descendeth unto Arabia, and cometh even unto the sea, unto the water of the outlet, shall heal the waters; and
⁹ every living creature that teemeth forth, upon whatsoever the river shall come thither, it shall live. And there shall be there exceeding many fish, because this water cometh thither; and it shall heal, and everything upon whatsoever the river shall come, there shall it live."
