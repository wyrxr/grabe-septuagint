23 νεανίσκον καὶ παρθένον, καὶ διασκορπιῶ ἐν σοὶ ποιμένα καὶ τὸ
24 ποίμνιον αὐτοῦ, καὶ διασκορπιῶ ἐν σοὶ γεωργὸν καὶ τὸ γεώργιον αὐτοῦ,
   καὶ διασκορπιῶ ἐν σοὶ ἡγεμόνας καὶ στρατηγούς σου. Καὶ ἀντα-
   ποδώσω τῇ Βαβυλωνίᾳ καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς κατοικοῦσι Χαλδαίοις
   πάσας τὰς ἀδικίας αὐτῶν, ἃς ἐποίησαν ἐπὶ Σιὼν κατ᾽ ὀφθαλ-
25 μοὺς ὑμῶν, λέγει Κύριος. Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ πρὸς σέ, τὸ ὄρος τὸ διε-
   φθαρμένον, λέγει Κύριος, τὸ διαφθεῖρον πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν, καὶ
   ἐκτενῶ τὴν χεῖρά μου ἐπὶ σέ, καὶ κατακυλίσω σε ἀπὸ τῶν πε-
26 τρῶν, καὶ δώσω σε ὡς ὄρος ἐμπεπυρισμένον, καὶ οὐ μὴ λάβωσιν
   ἀπὸ σοῦ λίθον εἰς γωνίαν, καὶ λίθον εἰς θεμέλιον, ὅτι εἰς ἀφα-
27 νισμὸν ἔσῃ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, λέγει Κύριος. Ἄρατε σημεῖον ἐπὶ τῆς
   γῆς, σαλπίσατε ἐν ἔθνεσι σάλπιγγι, ἁγιάσατε ἐπ᾽ αὐτὴν ἔθνη.
   παραγγείλατε ἐπ᾽ αὐτὴν βασιλείας ᾿Αραρὲθ παρ᾽ ἐμοῦ, καὶ τοῖς
   ᾿Ασχαναζαίοις· ἐπιστήσατε ἐπ᾽ αὐτὴν βελοστάσεις, ἀναβιβασατε
28 ἐπ᾽ αὐτὴν ἵππον ὡς ἀκρίδων πλῆθος. ᾿Αναβιβασατε ἐπ᾽ αὐτὴν
   ἔθνη, τὸν βασιλέα τῶν Μήδων καὶ πάσης τῆς γῆς, τοὺς ἡγε-
   μόνας αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντας τοὺς στρατηγοὺς αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάσης
29 τῆς γῆς ἐξουσίας αὐτοῦ. ᾿Εσείσθη ἡ γῆ, καὶ ἐπόνεσε, διότι ἐξα-
   νέστη ἐπὶ Βαβυλῶνα λογισμὸς Κυρίου, τοῦ θεῖναι τὴν γῆν Βα-
30 βυλῶνος εἰς ἀφανισμόν, καὶ μὴ κατοικεῖσθαι αὐτήν. ᾿Εξέλιπε
   μαχητὴς Βαβυλῶνος τοῦ πολεμεῖν, καὶ καθήσονται ἐκεῖ ἐν πε-
   ριοχῇ, ἐθραύσθη ἡ δυναστεία αὐτοῦ, ἐγενήθησαν ὡσεὶ γυναῖκες·
   ἐνετυρίσθη τὰ σκηνώματα αὐτῆς, συνεντρίβησαν οἱ μοχλοὶ αὐτῆς.
31 Διώκων εἰς ἀπάντην διώκοντος διώξεται, καὶ ἀναγγέλλων εἰς
   ἀπάντησιν ἀναγγέλλοντος τοῦ ἀναγγεῖλαι τῷ βασιλεῖ Βαβυλῶ-
32 νος, ὅτι ἑάλωκεν ἡ πόλις αὐτοῦ, ἀπ᾽ ἐσχάτου τῶν διαβάσεων
   αὐτοῦ ἐλήφθησαν, καὶ τὰ συστήματα αὐτοῦ ἐνέπρησαν ἐν πυρί,
33 καὶ ἄνδρες αὐτοῦ οἱ πολεμισταὶ ἐξέρχονται. Διότι τάδε λέγει
   Κύριος τῶν δυνάμεων ὁ Θεὸς ᾿Ισραήλ· οἴκοι βασιλέως Βαβυλῶ-
   νος ὡς ἅλων ὥριμος ἀλοηθήσονται· ἔτι μικρόν, καὶ ἥξει ὁ ἀ-
34 μητὸς αὐτῆς. Κατέφαγέ με, ἐμερίσατό με, κατέλαβέ με σκότος
   λεπτόν, Ναβουχοδονόσορ βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος κατέπιέ με, ὡς
35 δράκων ἔπλησε τὴν κοιλίαν αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τῆς τρυφῆς μου, ἐξωσάν
   με οἱ μόχθοι μου καὶ αἱ ταλαιπωρίαι μου εἰς Βαβυλῶνα, ἐρεῖ
   κατοικοῦσα Σιών, καὶ τὸ αἷμά μου ἐπὶ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας Χαλ-
36 δαίους, ἐρεῖ ῾Ιερουσαλήμ. Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Κύριος· ἰδοὺ

**Jeremiah, Chapter 28**
(Hebrew Chapter 51)

**23** young man and virgin; and I will scatter in thee shepherd and his flock;
    and I will scatter in thee farmer and his tillage; and I will scatter in thee thy rulers and commanders.
**24** And I will recompense to Babylon, and to all them that dwell in Chaldea, all their injustices which they have committed against Zion before your eyes, saith the Lord.
**25** Behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, saith the Lord, which destroyest all the earth. And I will stretch out My hand upon thee, and will roll thee down from the rocks;
**26** and I will make thee as a burnt mountain. And they shall not take from thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for a foundation; for thou shalt be for an utter desolation forever, saith the Lord.
**27** Lift ye up a standard upon the earth, blow the trumpet among the nations, sanctify nations against her! Summon against her the kingdoms of Ararat by Me, and the Ashkenaz; set up against her siege engines, bring up against her horses as a multitude of locusts.
**28** Bring up nations against her, the king of the Medes and of all the earth, his rulers, and all his commanders, and all the authorities of his land.
**29** The earth was shaken, and it travailed, because the purpose of the Lord hath risen up against Babylon, to make the land of Babylon an utter desolation, and that it should not be inhabited.
**30** The warrior of Babylon hath failed from fighting, and they shall sit there in confinement. His might was broken, they became as women. Her dwellings were burned up, her bars were broken in pieces.
**31** One running shall run to meet another runner, and one announcing to meet another announcing, to announce to the king of Babylon,
**32** that his city is taken, that they were taken from the uttermost of his passages, and his garrisons were burned with fire,
**33** and his men of war go forth. For thus saith the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel: The houses of the king of Babylon shall be threshed like a ripe threshing floor. Yet a little while, and her harvest shall come.
**34** "He hath devoured me, he hath divided me; a subtle darkness hath seized me," [saith Zion.] Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon hath swallowed me up; like a dragon he hath filled his belly from my delights.
**35** My travails and my hardships have cast me forth unto Babylon. Zion, that dwelleth [therein], shall say, "And my blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea." Jerusalem shall say.
**36** Therefore thus saith the Lord: Behold,
