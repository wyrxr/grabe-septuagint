ΚΕΦ. Γ΄.
                                ΘΡΗΝΟΙ
                                  Ἄλεφ.
3 Πλὴν ἐν ἐμοὶ ἐπέστρεψε χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν, ἐπα-
4 λαίωσε σάρκα μου καὶ δέρμα μου, ὀστᾶ μου συνέτριψεν.
                                  Βήθ.
5 Ἀνῳκοδόμησε κατ᾿ ἐμοῦ, καὶ ἐκύκλωσε κεφαλήν μου καὶ ἐμό-
6 χθησεν, ἐν σκοτεινοῖς ἐκάθισέ με ὡς νεκροὺς αἰῶνος. Ἀνῳκοδόμη-
7 σε κατ᾿ ἐμοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἐξελεύσομαι, ἐβάρυνε χαλκόν μου.
                                  Γίμελ.
8 Καί γε κεκράξομαι, καὶ γε βοήσω, ἀπέφραξε προσευχήν μου.
                                  Δάλεθ.
9 Ἀνῳκοδόμησεν ὁδοὺς μου, ἐνέφραξε τρίβους μου,
10 ἐτάραξεν ἄρκτος ἐνεδρεύουσα,
11 αὐτός μοι λέων ἐν κρυφαίοις, κατεδίωξεν ἀφεστηκότα, καὶ κατέπαυσέ με, ἔθετό με ἡφανισμένην.
                                  Ἤ.
12 Ἐνέτεινε τόξον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐστήλωσέ με ὡς σκοπὸν εἰς βέλος.
13 Εἰσήγαγεν ἐν τοῖς νεφροῖς μου ἰοὺς φαρέτρας αὐτοῦ.
14 Ἐγενήθην γέλως παντὶ τῷ λαῷ μου, ψαλμὸς αὐτῶν ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν.
                                  Οὐάδ.
15 Ἑώρτασέ με πικρίας, ἐμέθυσέ με χολῆς,
16 καὶ ἐξέβαλε ψήφῳ τοὺς ὀδόντας μου, ἐψώμισέ με σποδόν,
17 καὶ ἀπώσατο ἐξ εἰρήνης ψυχήν μου, ἐπελαθόμην ἀγαθά˙
18 καὶ ἀπώλετο νῖκός μου, καὶ ἡ ἐλπίς μου ἀπὸ Κυρίου.
                                  Ζαίν.
19 Ἐμνήσθην ἀπὸ πτωχείας μου, καὶ ἐκ διωγμοῦ μου.
20 πικρία γὰρ καὶ χολή μου μνησθήσεται, καὶ καταδολεχήσει ἐπ᾿ ἐμὲ ἡ ψυχή μου.
21 Ταύτην τάξω εἰς τὴν καρδίαν μου, διὰ τοῦτο ὑπομενῶ.
                                  [Ἥθ].
22 Τὰ ἐλέη Κυρίου, ὅτι οὐκ ἐξέλιπέ με, ὅτι οὐ συνετελέσθησαν οἱ
οἰκτιρμοὶ αὐτοῦ˙
23 μῆνας εἰς τὰς πρωΐας ἐλέησον, Κύριε, ὅτι οὐ συνετελέσθημεν, ὅτι οὐ συνετελέσθησαν οἱ οἰκτιρμοὶ αὐτοῦ. Καιναὶ
24 εἰς τὰς πρωΐας, πολλὴ ἡ πίστις σου. Μερίς μου Κύριος, εἶπεν ἡ ψυχή μου˙ διὰ τοῦτο ὑπομενῶ αὐτῷ.
                                  [Ἥθ].
25 Ἀγαθὸς Κύριος τοῖς ὑπομένουσιν αὐτόν, ψυχὴ ἡ ζητήσει
26 αὐτόν, ἀγαθόν˙ καὶ ὑπομενεῖ, καὶ ἡσυχάσει εἰς τὸ σωτήριον Κυρίου.

### Chapter III.

**Aleph.**
**3** Nevertheless, upon me hath He turned His hand all the day;
**4** He hath worn away my flesh and my skin; my bones hath He broken.

**Beth.**
**5** Against me hath He built, and compassed my head, and wrought [my woe];
**6** in dark places hath He made me to sit, as those that have been dead for ages.
**7** Against me hath He built, that I may not go forth; He hath made heavy my bronze [chains].

**Gimel.**
**8** And verily I shall cry out, yea, and verily I shall shout; [yet] He hath blocked out my prayer.

**Daleth.**
**9** He hath walled up my ways, He hath blocked my paths;
**10** a bear lying in wait hath troubled [me];
**11** He Himself [is] to me a lion in hidden places, He hath pursued [those] far removed, and hath made me to cease; He hath made me as one laid utterly waste.

**He.**
**12** He hath bent His bow, and hath set me as a mark for the arrow.
**13** He hath caused the arrows of His quiver to enter into my reins.
**14** I am become a derision to all my people, and their song all the day long.

**Waw.**
**15** He hath filled me with bitter things, He hath made me drunken with gall;
**16** and with a pebble hath He cast out my teeth; He hath fed me with ashes,
**17** and He hath thrust my soul away from peace; I had forgotten prosperity;
**18** and perished is my strength, and my hope from the Lord.

**Zayin.**
**19** I have remembered my poverty, and my persecution;
**20** for my bitterness and my gall shall be remembered, and my soul shall pine away within me.
**21** This will I lay to my heart, and therefore will I hope.

**Heth.**
**22** The mercies of the Lord, that He hath not failed me, that His compassions were not brought to an end;
**23** for months, even in the mornings, have mercy, O Lord; for we have not been utterly consumed, for His compassions were not brought to an end. New are they in the mornings; great is Thy faithfulness.
**24** The Lord is my portion, my soul hath said; therefore will I hope in Him.

**Heth.**
**25** Good is the Lord to those that wait for Him, [and to] the soul that seeketh Him, [it is] good;
**26** and he shall wait patiently, and shall quietly hope for the salvation of the Lord.
