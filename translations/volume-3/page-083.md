τῇ αἰνέσει σου. Εὐλογητὸς Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραὴλ ἀπὸ τοῦ αἰῶ- 48
νος καὶ ἕως τοῦ αἰῶνος· καὶ ἐρεῖ πᾶς ὁ λαός· γένοιτο, γένοιτο.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ΡΖ´. CVI.**

ΑΛΛΗΛΟΥΪΑ. Ἐξομολογεῖσθε τῷ Κυρίῳ ὅτι χρηστός, ὅτι 1
εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ. Εἰπάτωσαν οἱ λελυτρωμένοι ὑπὸ 2
Κυρίου, οὓς ἐλυτρώσατο ἐκ χειρὸς ἐχθροῦ· καὶ ἐκ τῶν χωρῶν 3
συνήγαγεν αὐτούς, ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν, καὶ δυσμῶν, καὶ βορρᾶ, καὶ
θαλάσσης. Ἐπλανήθησαν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, ἐν ἀνύδρῳ, ὁδὸν πόλεως 4
κατοικητηρίου οὐχ εὗρον· πεινῶντες καὶ διψῶντες, ἡ ψυχὴ αὐτῶν 5
ἐν αὐτοῖς ἐξέλιπε. Καὶ ἐκέκραξαν πρὸς Κύριον ἐν τῷ θλίβε- 6
σθαι αὐτούς, καὶ ἐκ τῶν ἀναγκῶν αὐτῶν ἐξέσατο αὐτούς· καὶ 7
ὡδήγησεν αὐτοὺς εἰς ὁδὸν εὐθεῖαν, τοῦ πορευθῆναι εἰς πόλιν κατ-
οικητηρίου. Ἐξομολογησάσθωσαν τῷ Κυρίῳ τὰ ἐλέη αὐτοῦ, καὶ 8
τὰ θαυμάσια αὐτοῦ τοῖς υἱοῖς τῶν ἀνθρώπων· ὅτι ἐχόρτασε ψυχὴν 9
κενήν, καὶ ψυχὴν πεινῶσαν ἐνέπλησεν ἀγαθῶν. Καθημένους ἐν 10
σκότει καὶ σκιᾷ θανάτου, πεπεδημένους ἐν πτωχείᾳ καὶ σιδήρῳ·
ὅτι παρεπίκραναν τὰ λόγια τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ τὴν βουλὴν τοῦ ὑψίστου 11
παρώξυναν. Καὶ ἐταπεινώθη ἐν κόποις ἡ καρδία αὐτῶν, (καὶ) ἠσθέ- 12
νησαν, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ βοηθῶν. Καὶ ἐκέκραξαν πρὸς Κύριον ἐν τῷ 13
θλίβεσθαι αὐτούς, καὶ ἐκ τῶν ἀναγκῶν αὐτῶν ἔσωσεν αὐτούς· καὶ 14
ἐξήγαγεν αὐτοὺς ἐκ σκότους καὶ σκιᾶς θανάτου, καὶ τοὺς δεσμοὺς
αὐτῶν διέρρηξεν. Ἐξομολογησάσθωσαν τῷ Κυρίῳ τὰ ἐλέη αὐτοῦ, 15
καὶ τὰ θαυμάσια αὐτοῦ τοῖς υἱοῖς τῶν ἀνθρώπων· ὅτι συνέτριψε 16
πύλας χαλκᾶς. καὶ μοχλοὺς σιδηροῦς συνέθλασεν. Ἀντελάβετο 17
αὐτῶν ἐξ ὁδοῦ ἀνομίας αὐτῶν· διὰ γὰρ τὰς ἀνομίας αὐτῶν ἐτα-
πεινώθησαν. Πᾶν βρῶμα ἐβδελύξατο ἡ ψυχὴ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἤγγισαν 18
ἕως τῶν πυλῶν τοῦ θανάτου. Καὶ ἐκέκραξαν πρὸς Κύριον ἐν τῷ 19
θλίβεσθαι αὐτούς, καὶ ἐκ τῶν ἀναγκῶν αὐτῶν ἔσωσεν αὐτούς· ἀπ- 20
έστειλε τὸν λόγον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἰάσατο αὐτούς, καὶ ἐξήρυσάτο αὐτοὺς
ἐκ τῶν διαφθορῶν αὐτῶν. Ἐξομολογησάσθωσαν τῷ Κυρίῳ τὰ 21
ἐλέη αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰ θαυμάσια αὐτοῦ τοῖς υἱοῖς τῶν ἀνθρώπων· καὶ 22
θυσάτωσαν (αὐτῷ) θυσίαν αἰνέσεως, καὶ ἐξαγγειλάτωσαν τὰ ἔργα
αὐτοῦ ἐν ἀγαλλιάσει. Οἱ καταβαίνοντες εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν ἐν 23
πλοίοις, οἱ ποιοῦντες ἐργασίαν ἐν ὕδασι πολλοῖς· αὐτοὶ ἴδον τὰ ἔρ- 24

Thy praise.
48 Blessed be the Lord God of Israel
    From everlasting to everlasting;
    And let all the people say, Amen, Amen.

**PSALM CVI.**

**HALLELUJAH.**
1 Oh, give thanks unto the Lord, for He is good,
    For His mercy endureth forever.
2 Let the redeemed of the Lord say [so],
    Whom He hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;
3 And gathered them out of the lands,
    From the East, and from the West,
    From the North, and from the Sea.
4 They wandered in the wilderness, in a waterless place,
    They found no way to a city for habitation.
5 Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted within them.
6 Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble,
    And He delivered them out of their distresses.
7 And He led them forth by the straight way,
    That they might go to a city for habitation.
8 Oh, let them give thanks unto the Lord for His mercies,
    And for His wondrous works to the children of men;
9 For He hath satisfied the empty soul,
    And filled the hungry soul with good things.
10 [Such as] sit in darkness and in the shadow of death,
    Bound in affliction and in iron;
11 Because they provoked the words of God,
    And angered the counsel of the Most High.
12 And their heart was humbled with labors,
    And they were weakened,
    And there was none to help [them].
13 Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble,
    And He saved them out of their distresses.
14 And He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death,
    And broke their bonds asunder.
15 Oh, let them give thanks unto the Lord for His mercies,
    And for His wondrous works to the children of men;
16 For He hath broken the gates of bronze,
    And shattered the bars of iron.
17 He took them out of the way of their iniquity;
    For because of their iniquities they were humbled.
18 Their soul abhorred all manner of food,
    And they drew near unto the gates of death.
19 Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble,
    And He saved them out of their distresses.
20 He sent forth His word, and healed them,
    And delivered them from their corruptions.
21 Oh, let them give thanks unto the Lord for His mercies,
    And for His wondrous works to the children of men;
22 And let them sacrifice unto Him the sacrifice of praise,
    And declare His works with rejoicing.
23 They that go down to the sea in ships,
    That do business in great waters;
24 These have seen the works of the Lord,
