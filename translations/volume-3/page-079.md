σιν αὐτοῖς. Ἀνέτειλεν ὁ ἥλιος, καὶ συνήχθησαν, καὶ εἰς τὰς μάνδρας 22
αὐτῶν κοιτασθήσονται· ἐξελεύσεται ἄνθρωπος ἐπὶ τὸ ἔργον 23
αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν ἐργασίαν αὐτοῦ ἕως ἑσπέρας. Ὡς ἐμεγαλύνθη 24
τὰ ἔργα σου Κύριε· πάντα ἐν σοφίᾳ ἐποίησας· ἐπληρώθη ἡ γῆ τῆς 25
κτήσεώς σου. Αὕτη ἡ θάλασσα ἡ μεγάλη καὶ εὐρύχωρος χερσίν· 26
ἐκεῖ ἑρπετὰ ὧν οὐκ ἔστιν ἀριθμός, ζῶα μικρὰ μετὰ μεγάλων· ἐκεῖ 27
πλοῖα διαπορεύονται, δράκων οὗτος ὃν ἔπλασας ἐμπαίζειν αὐτῷ. 28
Πάντα πρὸς σὲ προσδοκῶσι, δοῦναι τὴν τροφὴν αὐτῶν εἰς καιρόν· 29
δόντος σου αὐτοῖς, συλλέξουσιν· ἀνοίξαντος (δὲ) σου τὴν χεῖρα, τὰ 30
σύμπαντα πλησθήσονται χρηστότητος. Ἀποστρέψαντος δέ σου τὸ 31
πρόσωπον, ταραχθήσονται· ἀντανελεῖς τὸ πνεῦμα αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐκλείψουσι, 32
καὶ εἰς τὸν χοῦν αὐτῶν ἐπιστρέψουσιν· ἐξαποστελεῖς τὸ 33
πνεῦμά σου, καὶ κτισθήσονται, καὶ ἀνακαινιεῖς τὸ πρόσωπον τῆς 34
γῆς. Ἦτω ἡ δόξα Κυρίου εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα· εὐφρανθήσεται Κύριος 35
ἐπὶ τοῖς ἔργοις αὐτοῦ. Ὁ ἐπιβλέπων ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, καὶ ποιῶν αὐτήν 36
τρέμειν· ὁ ἁπτόμενος τῶν ὀρέων, καὶ καπνίζονται. Ἆσω τῷ 37
Κυρίῳ ἐν τῇ ζωῇ μου, ψαλῶ τῷ Θεῷ μου ἕως ὑπάρχω· ἡδυνθείη 38
αὐτῷ ἡ διαλογή μου, ἐγὼ δὲ εὐφρανθήσομαι ἐπὶ τῷ Κυρίῳ. Ἐκλείποισαν 39
ἁμαρτωλοὶ ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς καὶ ἄνομοι, ὥστε μὴ ὑπάρχειν 40
αὐτούς· εὐλόγει ἡ ψυχή μου τὸν Κύριον. 41

ΨΑΛΜ. ΡΔ´. CIV.

ΑΛΛΗΛΟΥΪΑ. Ἐξομολογεῖσθε τῷ Κυρίῳ, καὶ ἐπικαλεῖσθε 1
τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ· ἀπαγγείλατε ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ. Ἄσατε 2
αὐτῷ καὶ ψάλατε αὐτῷ· διηγήσασθε πάντα τὰ θαυμάσια αὐτοῦ. 3
Ἐπαινεῖσθε ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι τῷ ἁγίῳ αὐτοῦ· εὐφρανθήτω καρδία 4
ζητούντων τὸν Κύριον. Ζητήσατε τὸν Κύριον, καὶ κραταιώθητε· 5
ζητήσατε τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ διαπαντός. Μνήσθητε τῶν 6
θαυμασίων αὐτοῦ ὧν ἐποίησε, τὰ τέρατα αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰ κρίματα 7
τοῦ στόματος αὐτοῦ· σπέρμα Ἀβραὰμ δοῦλοι αὐτοῦ, υἱοὶ Ἰακὼβ 8
ἐκλεκτοὶ αὐτοῦ. Αὐτὸς Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν· ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ τὰ 9
κρίματα αὐτοῦ. Ἐμνήσθη εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα διαθήκης αὐτοῦ, λόγου 10
οὗ ἐνετείλατο εἰς χιλίας γενεάς· ὃν διεθέτο τῷ Ἀβραάμ, καὶ τοῦ 11
ὅρκου αὐτοῦ τῷ Ἰσαάκ· καὶ ἔστησεν αὐτὸν τῷ Ἰακὼβ εἰς πρόσχημα, 12
καὶ τῷ Ἰσραὴλ εἰς διαθήκην αἰώνιον, λέγων· σοὶ δώσω τὴν 13

**PSALM CIII.** (continued)

22 ...The sun ariseth, and they are gathered in;
    And in their dens shall they lay them down.
23 Man goeth forth unto his work,
    And to his labour until the evening.
24 How manifold are Thy works, O Lord!
    In wisdom hast Thou made them all;
    The earth is filled with Thy possession.
25 This great and wide sea, spacious for hands;
26 Therein are creeping things innumerable,
    Small creatures with great.
27 There go the ships;
    There is this dragon whom Thou hast formed to play therein.
28 All things wait upon Thee,
    That Thou mayest give them their food in due season.
29 When Thou hast given it them, they shall gather it;
    But when Thou hast opened Thy hand,
30 All things shall be filled with goodness.
31 When Thou turnest away Thy face, they shall be troubled;
    Thou shalt take away their spirit, and they shall fail,
32 And unto their dust shall they return.
    Thou shalt send forth Thy Spirit, and they shall be created,
33 And Thou shalt renew the face of the earth.
34 Let the glory of the Lord be for ever;
    The Lord shall rejoice in His works.
35 He who looketh upon the earth, and maketh it to tremble;
    He who toucheth the mountains, and they smoke.
36 I will sing unto the Lord in my life,
    I will chant unto my God as long as I have my being.
37 Let my meditation be sweet unto Him;
    But I will rejoice in the Lord.
38 Let sinners fail from the earth,
    And the lawless, so that they cease to be.
39 Bless the Lord, O my soul!

**PSALM CIV.**

ALLELUIA.

1 O give thanks unto the Lord, and call upon His Name;
    Declare among the Gentiles His works.
2 Sing unto Him, and chant unto Him;
    Narrate all His wondrous deeds.
3 Glory ye in His holy Name;
    Let the heart of those that seek the Lord rejoice.
4 Seek the Lord, and be made strong;
    Seek His face evermore.
5 Remember His wonders which He hath done,
    His marvels, and the judgments of His mouth.
6 Ye seed of Abraham, His servants,
    Ye sons of Jacob, His chosen ones.
7 He is the Lord our God;
    In all the earth are His judgments.
8 He hath remembered His covenant forever,
    The word which He commanded to a thousand generations;
9 Which He made with Abraham, and His oath unto Isaac;
10 And He established it unto Jacob for a precept,
11 And unto Israel for an everlasting covenant, saying:
12 "Unto thee will I give the...
