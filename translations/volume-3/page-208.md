6 ἔσται ὃν τρόπον ἐάν τις συναγάγῃ στάχυν ἐν φάραγγι στερεᾷ, καὶ καταλειφθῇ ἐν αὐτῇ καλάμη, ἢ ὡς ῥῶγες ἐλαίας δύο ἢ τρεῖς
7 ἐπ᾽ ἄκρου μετεώρου, ἢ τέσσαρες ἢ πέντε ἐπὶ τῶν κλάδων αὐτοῦ καταλειφθῇ· τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ.
8 Τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ πεποιθὼς ἔσται ὁ ἄνθρωπος ἐπὶ τῷ ποιήσαντι αὐτόν, οἱ δὲ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸν ἅγιον τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ ἐμβλέψονται, καὶ οὐ μὴ πεποιθότες ὦσιν ἐπὶ τοῖς βωμοῖς, οὐδὲ ἐπὶ τοῖς ἔργοις τῶν χειρῶν αὐτῶν, ἃ ἐποίησαν οἱ δάκτυλοι αὐτῶν, καὶ οὐκ ὄψονται τὰ ἄλση αὐτῶν, οὐδὲ τὰ βδελύγματα αὐτῶν.
9 Τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, ἔσονται αἱ πόλεις σου ἐγκαταλελειμμέναι, ὃν τρόπον ἐγκατέλειπον οἱ Ἀμορραῖοι καὶ οἱ Εὐαῖοι ἀπὸ προσώπου τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ· καὶ ἔσονται ἔρημοι,
10 διότι ἐγκατέλειπες τὸν Θεὸν τὸν σωτῆρά σου, καὶ κυρίου τοῦ βοηθοῦ σου οὐκ ἐμνήσθης· διὰ τοῦτο φυτεύσεις φύτευμα ἄπιστον, καὶ σπέρμα ἄπιστον.
11 Τῇ δὲ ἡμέρᾳ ᾗ ἂν φυτεύσῃς, πλανηθήσῃ· τὸ δὲ πρωῒ ἐὰν σπείρῃς, ἀνήσει εἰς ἅμητὸν ἢ ἂν ἡμέρᾳ κληρώσῃ, καὶ ὥσπερ πατὴρ ἀνθρώπου κληρώσῃ τοῖς υἱοῖς.
12 Οὐαὶ πλῆθος ἐθνῶν πολλῶν· ὡς θάλασσα κυμαίνουσα, οὕτως ταραχθήσεσθε· καὶ νῶτος ἐθνῶν πολλῶν, ὡς ὕδωρ ἡγήσει·
13 Ὡς ὕδωρ πολὺ ἔθνη πολλά, ὡς ἦχος ὕδατος πολλοῦ βίᾳ καταφερομένου· καὶ ἀποσκορακιεῖ αὐτόν, καὶ πόῤῥω αὐτὸν διώξεται, ὡς χνοῦν ἀχύρου λικμώντων ἀπέναντι ἀνέμου, καὶ ὡς κονιορτὸν τροχοῦ καταιγὶς φέρουσα,
14 πρὸς ἑσπέραν καὶ ἔσαι πένθος, πρὶν πρωῒ, καὶ οὐκ ἔσαι· αὕτη ἡ μερὶς τῶν ἡμᾶς προνομευσάντων, καὶ κληρονομία τοῖς ἡμᾶς κληρονομήσασιν.

1 ΟΥΑΙ γῆς πλοίων πτέρυγες, ἐπέκεινα ποταμῶν Αἰθιοπίας·
2 Ὁ ἀποστέλλων ἐν θαλάσσῃ ὄμηρα, καὶ ἐπιστολὰς βιβλίνας ἐπάνω τοῦ ὕδατος· πορεύσονται γὰρ ἄγγελοι κοῦφοι πρὸς ἔθνος
4 μετέωρον, καὶ ξένον λαὸν καὶ χαλεπόν· τί αὐτοῦ ἐπέκεινα; ἔθνος ἀνέλπιστον καὶ καταπεπαμένον (νῦν) οὐ διήρπασαν οἱ ποταμοὶ τῆς γῆς πάντες, ὡς χώρα κατοικουμένη κατοικηθήσεται· ἡ
5 χώρα αὐτῶν ὡσεὶ σημεῖον ἀπὸ ὄρους ἀρθῇ, ὡς σάλπιγγος φωνὴ
6 ἀκουστὸν ἔσαι. Ὅτι οὕτως εἶπέ μοι Κύριος· ἀσφάλεια ἔσται ἐν
7 τῇ ἐμῇ πόλει, ὡς φῶς καύματος μεσημβρίας, καὶ ὡς νεφέλη

**Chapter 17**

**6** And it shall be as when one gathereth standing ears in a steep valley, and straw is left therein; or like two or three olives
**7** upon the uppermost bough, or four or five [olives] shall be left upon the branches thereof. Thus saith the Lord God of Israel:
**8** In that day shall a man trust in Him that made him, and his eyes shall look unto the Holy One of Israel. And they shall not trust in the altars, nor in the works of their hands, which their fingers have made; neither shall they look upon their groves, nor upon their abominations.
**9** In that day, thy cities shall be forsaken, in the manner that the Amorites and the Hivites forsook [them] from before the face of the children of Israel; and they shall be desolate,
**10** because thou hast forsaken God thy Savior, and hast not remembered the Lord thy Helper. Therefore shalt thou plant a faithless plant, and a faithless seed.
**11** And in the day that thou plantest, thou shalt be led astray; and in the morning if thou sowest, it shall grow up for a harvest; or if in a day thou dost allot, and as a father of a man thou dost allot to the sons.
**12** Woe to the multitude of many nations! As the surging sea, so shall ye be troubled; and the host of many nations, like water thou shalt lead.
**13** As many waters are many nations, as the sound of many waters violently rushing down. And He shall drive him away, and afar off shall He pursue him, as the chaff of those winnowing before the wind, and as dust of a wheel that a storm carrieth.
**14** Towards evening, there shall be sorrow; before morning, and it shall not be. This is the portion of them that plundered us, and the inheritance for them that dispossessed us.

**Chapter 18**

**1** Woe to the land of ships' wings, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia!
**2** He who sendeth hostages by the sea, and written messages upon the water. For swift messengers shall go forth unto a nation
**4** lofty, and to a foreign and fierce people. What is beyond it? A nation without hope and trampled down; (now) all the rivers of the earth have not plundered [it]. As a dwelt-in land, it shall be dwelt in;
**5** their land, as a sign from a mountain, shall be lifted up; as the sound of a trumpet
**6** shall be heard. For thus saith the Lord unto me: There shall be security in
**7** My city, as the light of the noontime heat, and as a cloud
