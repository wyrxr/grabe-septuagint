ἀπότρεχε πρὸς Γοδολίαν υἱὸν Ἀχεικάμ, υἱοῦ Σαφάν, ὃν κατέ-
στησε βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος ἐν γῇ Ἰούδα, καὶ οἴκησον μετ᾿ αὐ-
τοῦ ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ λαοῦ ἐν γῇ Ἰούδα εἰς ἅπαντα τὰ ἀγαθὰ ἐν
ὀφθαλμοῖς σου τοῦ πορευθῆναι, καὶ πορεύου· καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ
ὁ ἀρχιμάγειρος ἑστιατορίαν καὶ δῶρα, καὶ ἀπέστειλεν αὐτόν.
Καὶ ἦλθεν Ἱερεμίας πρὸς Γοδολίαν υἱὸν Ἀχικάμ εἰς Μασσηφά,
καὶ ἐκάθισε μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ λαοῦ τοῦ καταλειφθέντος,
ἐν τῇ γῇ. Καὶ ἤκουσαν πάντες οἱ ἡγεμόνες τῆς δυνάμεως τῆς
ἐν ἀγρῷ, αὐτοὶ καὶ ἡ δύναμις αὐτῶν, καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες αὐτῶν,
ὅτι κατέστησε βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος τὸν Γοδολίαν υἱὸν Ἀχικάμ
ἐν τῇ γῇ, καὶ ὅτι παρεκατέθεντο αὐτῷ ἄνδρας καὶ γυναῖκας αὐ-
τῶν, καὶ ὄχλον πολύν, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν πτωχῶν τῆς γῆς, οὓς οὐ
κατώκισεν εἰς Βαβυλῶνα· καὶ ἦλθε πρὸς Γοδολίαν εἰς Μασσηφὰ
Ἰσμαὴλ υἱὸς Ναθανίου, καὶ Ἰωάνναν καὶ Ἰωνάθαν υἱὸς Κάρηε,
καὶ Σαραίας υἱὸς Θαναεμὲθ, καὶ υἱοὶ Ὠφὴ τοῦ Νετωφαθεῖ,
καὶ Ἰεζονίας υἱὸς τοῦ Μωχαβεῖ, αὐτοὶ, καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες αὐτῶν.
Καὶ ὤμοσεν αὐτοῖς Γοδολίας υἱὸς Ἀχικάμ υἱοῦ Σαφάν, καὶ
τοῖς ἀνδράσιν αὐτῶν, λέγων· μὴ φοβηθῆτε ἀπὸ προσώπου τῶν
παίδων τῶν Χαλδαίων· κατοικήσατε ἐν τῇ γῇ, καὶ ἐργάσασθε
τῷ βασιλεῖ Βαβυλῶνος, καὶ βέλτιον ἔσται ὑμῖν. Καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ
κάθημαι ἐναντίον ὑμῶν, εἰς Μασσηφὰ, στῆναι κατὰ πρόσωπον
τῶν Χαλδαίων, οἳ ἐὰν ἔλθωσιν ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς· καὶ ὑμεῖς συναγάγετε
οἶνον καὶ ὀπώραν, καὶ συναγάγετε ἔλαιον, καὶ βάλετε εἰς τὰ
ἀγγεῖα ὑμῶν, καὶ οἰκήσατε ἐν ταῖς πόλεσιν αἷς κατεκρα-
τήσατε. Καὶ πάντες οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι οἱ ἐν γῇ Μωάβ, καὶ οἱ ἐν υἱοῖς
Ἀμμὼν, καὶ οἱ ἐν τῇ Ἰδουμαίᾳ, καὶ οἱ ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ, ἤ-
κουσαν ὅτι ἔδωκε βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος τὰ καταλείμματα τῷ
Ἰούδᾳ, καὶ ὅτι κατέστησεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς τὸν Γοδολίαν υἱὸν Ἀχι-
κάμ υἱοῦ Σαφάν. Καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι ἐκ πάντων τῶν
τόπων, οὗ διεσπάρησαν ἐκεῖ, καὶ ἦλθον πρὸς Γοδολίαν εἰς γῆν
Ἰούδα εἰς Μασσηφά, καὶ συνήγαγον οἶνον καὶ ὀπώραν πολλὴν
σφόδρα, καὶ ἔλαιον. Καὶ Ἰωάνναν υἱὸς Κάρηε, καὶ πάντες οἱ
ἡγεμόνες τῆς δυνάμεως, οἱ ἐν τοῖς ἀγροῖς, ἦλθαν πρὸς Γοδο-
λίαν εἰς Μασσηφὰ, καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῷ· ἐν γνώσει γινώσκεις, ὅτι
βασιλεὺς υἱῶν Ἀμμὼν Βελισὰ ἀπέστειλε πρὸς σὲ τὸν Ἰσμαὴλ
υἱὸν Ναθανίου πατάξαι σου ψυχήν· καὶ οὐκ ἐπίστευσεν αὐτοῖς

**JEREMIAH 47 (Septuagint) / JEREMIAH 40 (Hebrew)**

**5** turn thou back unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath appointed in the land of Judah; and dwell with him in the midst of the people in the land of Judah. And for all that which is good in thine eyes to go, go thou. And the captain of the guard gave him provisions and gifts, and sent him away.

**6** And Jeremiah came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah, and dwelt with him in the midst of the remnant of the people in the land.

**7** And all the captains of the forces which were in the field, they and their forces, and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam in the land, and that [he] had committed unto him [the] men and their women, and a great multitude, and some of the poor of the land, whom he had not led away captive unto Babylon.

**8** And there came unto Gedaliah at Mizpah Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ophai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men.

**9** And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, sware unto them and to their men, saying, Be ye not afraid of the Chaldean servants; dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.

**10** And behold, I, I do remain before you in Mizpah, to stand before the Chaldeans, whoever should come against you. And ye, gather ye wine and summer fruit; yea, gather ye oil, and put them into your vessels, and dwell in the cities which ye have possessed.

**11** Now all the Jews who were in the land of Moab, and those among the sons of Ammon, and those in Idumaea, and those in every land, heard that the king of Babylon had given the remnant to Judah, and that he had appointed over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan.

**12** And all the Jews returned from all the places where they were scattered there, and came unto Gedaliah into the land of Judah, to Mizpah, and gathered wine and much summer fruit, yea, and oil.

**13** And Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were in the fields, came unto Gedaliah to Mizpah,

**14** and said unto him, Thou knowest of a surety that Baalis, the king of the sons of Ammon, hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to strike thy soul. But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not.
