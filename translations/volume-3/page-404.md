20 Τοῦτο τὸ ζῷον ἐστιν, ὃ εἶδον ὑποκάτω Θεοῦ Ἰσραὴλ ἐπὶ τοῦ ποταμοῦ
21 τοῦ Χοβάρ, καὶ ἔγνων ὅτι Χερουβεὶμ ἐστι. Τέσσαρα πρόσωπα τῷ
    ἑνί, καὶ ὀκτὼ πτέρυγες τῷ ἑνί, καὶ ὁμοίωμα χειρῶν ἀνθρώπου ὑποκάτωθεν
22 τῶν πτερύγων αὐτῶν. Καὶ ὁμοίωμα τῶν προσώπων αὐτῶν· ταῦτα
    τὰ πρόσωπα ἐστιν, ἃ εἶδον ὑποκάτω τῆς δόξης Θεοῦ Ἰσραὴλ ἐπὶ τοῦ
    ποταμοῦ τοῦ Χοβὰρ τὴν ὅρασιν αὐτῶν, καὶ αὐτὰ ἕκαστον κατὰ πρόσωπον
    αὐτῶν ἐπορεύοντο.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΑʹ. ΧΙ.

1 ΚΑΙ ἀνέλαβέ με πνεῦμα, καὶ ἤγαγέ με ἐπὶ τὴν πύλην τοῦ οἴκου Κυρίου
    τὴν κατέναντι, τὴν βλέπουσαν κατὰ ἀνατολάς· καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐπὶ τῶν προθύρων
    τῆς πύλης ὡς εἴκοσι καὶ πέντε ἄνδρες, καὶ ἰδὼν ἐν μέσω αὐτῶν τὸν
    Ἰεχονίαν τὸν τοῦ Ἰάζερ καὶ Φαλτίαν τὸν τοῦ Βαναίου, τοὺς ἀρχηγουμένους
2 τοῦ λαοῦ. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς μέ· Υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, οὗτοι οἱ ἄνδρες οἱ
    λογιζόμενοι μάταια καὶ βουλευόμενοι βουλὴν πονηρὰν ἐν τῇ πόλει ταύτῃ,
3 οἱ λέγοντες, Οὐχὶ προσφάτως ᾠκοδόμηνται αἱ οἰκίαι; αὕτη ἐστιν ὁ λέβης,
    ἡμεῖς δὲ τὰ κρέα.
4 Διὰ τοῦτο προφήτευσον ἐπ’ αὐτούς, προφήτευσον, υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου.
5 Καὶ ἔπεσεν ἐπ’ ἐμὲ πνεῦμα Κυρίου, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς μέ· λέγε· τάδε λέγει
    Κύριος· οὕτως εἴπατε, ὁ οἶκος Ἰσραήλ, καὶ τὰ διαβούλια τοῦ πνεύματος
6 ὑμῶν ἐγὼ ἐπίσταμαι, ἐπληθύνατε νεκροὺς ὑμῶν ἐν τῇ πόλει ταύτῃ, καὶ
    ἐνεπλήσατε τὰς ὁδοὺς αὐτῆς τραυματιῶν.
7 Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναὶ Κύριος· τοὺς νεκροὺς ὑμῶν, οὓς ἐτάξατε
    ἐν μέσω αὐτῆς, οὗτοί εἰσι τὰ κρέα, αὕτη δὲ ὁ λέβης ἐστι, καὶ ὑμᾶς ἐξάξω
    ἐκ μέσου αὐτῆς.
8 Ῥομφαίαν φοβεῖσθε, καὶ ῥομφαίαν ἐπάξω ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς, λέγει Ἀδωναὶ Κύριος.
9 Καὶ ἐξάξω ὑμᾶς ἐκ μέσου αὐτῆς, καὶ παραδώσω ὑμᾶς εἰς χεῖρας ἀλλοτρίων,
    καὶ ποιήσω ἐν ὑμῖν κρίματα.
10 Ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ πεσεῖσθε, (καὶ) ἐπὶ τῶν ὁρίων τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ κρινῶ ὑμᾶς, καὶ
    ἐπιγνώσεσθε ὅτι ἐγὼ Κύριος.
11 Αὕτη ὑμῖν οὐκ ἔσται εἰς λέβητα, καὶ ὑμεῖς οὐ μὴ γένησθε ἐν μέσω αὐτῆς
    εἰς κρέα· ἐπὶ τῶν ὁρίων τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ κρινῶ ὑμᾶς.
12 Καὶ ἐπιγνώσεσθε διότι ἐγὼ Κύριος· ὅτι ἐν τοῖς δικαιώμασί μου οὐκ
    ἐπορεύθητε, καὶ τὰ κρίματά μου οὐκ ἐποιήσατε, ἀλλὰ κατὰ τὰ κρίματα
    τῶν ἐθνῶν τῶν περικύκλῳ ὑμῶν ἐποιήσατε.
13 Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ προφητεύειν με, καὶ Φαλτίας ὁ τοῦ Βαναίου ἀπέθανε,
    καὶ πί-

### Chapter 10

**20** This is the living creature which I saw beneath the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that these were Cherubim.
**21** Four faces had the one [creature], and eight wings had the one [creature]; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.
**22** And the likeness of their faces; these are the faces which I saw under the glory of the God of Israel by the river Chebar in their vision; and they went, each one according to its own face.

### Chapter 11

**1** And the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the gate of the House of the Lord that stood opposite, which looketh toward the east. And behold, at the threshold of the gate were as twenty and five men; and I saw in the midst of them Jechoniah the son of Iazer, and Phaltiah the son of Banaiah, the chief men of the people.
**2** And the Lord said unto me, "Son of man, these are the men that devise vanity, and counsel an evil counsel in this city,
**3** saying, 'Are not the houses built recently? This [city] is the caldron, and we are the flesh.'"
**4** Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.
**5** And the Spirit of the Lord fell upon me, and said unto me, "Say, 'Thus saith the Lord: Thus shall you say, O house of Israel, and the counsels of your spirit I know,
**6** you have multiplied your dead in this city, and you have filled her streets with the slain.
**7** Therefore thus saith Adonai the Lord: Your dead, whom you have appointed in the midst thereof, these are the flesh, and this [city] is the caldron; and I will bring you forth out of the midst of it.
**8** You fear the sword, and I will bring the sword upon you, saith Adonai the Lord.
**9** And I will bring you forth out of the midst thereof, and I will deliver you into the hands of strangers, and I will execute judgments among you.
**10** By the sword shall you fall, [and] upon the borders of Israel will I judge you; and you shall know that I am the Lord.
**11** This [city] shall not be your caldron, neither shall you be as flesh in the midst thereof; upon the borders of Israel will I judge you.
**12** And you shall know that I am the Lord; for you have not walked in My statutes, neither have you executed My judgments, but according to the judgments of the nations that are round about you have you done.
**13** And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Phaltiah the son of Banaiah died. And I fell
