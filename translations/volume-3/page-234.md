**16** Κύριον, λέγων· Κύριε Σαβαὼθ ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ, ὁ καθήμενος
ἐπὶ τῶν Χερουβείμ, σὺ Θεὸς μόνος εἶ πάσης βασιλείας τῆς
**17** οἰκουμένης, σὺ ἐποίησας τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ τὴν γῆν, κλίνον Κύ-
ριε τὸ οὖς σου, εἰσάκουσον Κύριε, ἄνοιξον Κύριε τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς
σου, εἰσβλέψον Κύριε, καὶ ἰδε τοὺς λόγους, οὓς ἀπέστειλε Σεν-
**18** ναχηρείμ ὀνειδίζειν Θεὸν ζῶντα. Ἐπ᾽ ἀληθείας γάρ, Κύριε,
ἠρήμωσαν βασιλεῖς Ἀσσυρίων τὴν οἰκουμένην ὅλην, καὶ τὴν χώ-
**19** ραν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐνέβαλον τὰ εἴδωλα αὐτῶν εἰς τὸ πῦρ·
οὐ γὰρ θεοὶ ἦσαν, ἀλλὰ ἔργα χειρῶν ἀνθρώπων, ξύλα καὶ
**20** λίθοι, καὶ ἀπώλεσαν αὐτούς. Νῦν δὲ Κύριε ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν,
σῶσον ἡμᾶς ἐκ χειρὸς αὐτοῦ, ἵνα γνῷ πᾶσα βασιλεία τῆς γῆς,
**21** ὅτι σὺ εἶ Θεὸς μόνος. Καὶ ἀπεστάλη Ἡσαΐας υἱὸς Ἀμὼς
πρὸς Ἑζεκίαν, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς
Ἰσραήλ· ἤκουσα ἃ προσηύξω πρὸς μὲ περὶ Σενναχηρείμ βα-
**22** σιλέως Ἀσσυρίων. Οὗτος ὁ λόγος, ὃν ἐλάλησε περὶ αὐτοῦ ὁ
Θεός· ἐφαύλισέ σε, καὶ ἐμυκτήρισέ σε παρθένος θυγάτηρ Σιῶν,
**23** ἐπὶ σοὶ κεφαλὴν ἐκίνησε θυγάτηρ Ἰερουσαλήμ. Τίνα ὠνείδισας
καὶ παρώξυνας; ἢ πρὸς τίνα ὕψωσας τὴν φωνήν σου; καὶ οὐκ
ἦρας εἰς ὕψος τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς σου, εἰς τὸν ἅγιον τοῦ
**24** Ἰσραήλ; “Ὅτι δι᾽ ἀγγέλων σου ὠνείδισας Κύριον· σὺ γὰρ εἶ-
πας, τῷ πλήθει τῶν ἁρμάτων μου ἐγὼ ἀνέβην εἰς ὕψος ὀρέων,
καὶ εἰς τὰ ἔσχατα τοῦ Λιβάνου, καὶ ἔκοψα τὸ ὕψος τῆς κέ-
δρου αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὸ κάλλος κυπαρίσσου αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἰσῆλθον εἰς
**25** ὕψος μέρους τοῦ δρυμοῦ τοῦ Καρμήλου· καὶ ἔθηκα γέφυραν,
**26** καὶ ἠρήμωσα ὕδατα καὶ πᾶσαν συναγωγὴν ὕδατος. Οὐ ταῦτα
ἤκουσας πάλαι, ἃ ἐγὼ ἐποίησα; ἐξ ἀρχαίων ἡμερῶν συνέταξα,
νῦν δὲ ἐπέδειξα ἐξερημῶσαι ἔθνη ἐν ὀχυροῖς, καὶ ἐνοικοῦντας
**27** ἐν πόλεσιν ὀχυραῖς. Ἀνῆκα τὰς χεῖρας, καὶ ἐξηράνθησαν, καὶ
ἐγένοντο ὡς χόρτος χλωρὸς ἐπὶ δωμάτων, καὶ ὡς ἀγρωστις
**28** ἀφανιζομένη, πρὸ τοῦ τελεσφορηθῆναι. Νῦν δὲ τὴν ἀνάπαυσίν
σου, καὶ τὴν ἔξοδόν σου, καὶ τὴν εἴσοδόν σου ἐγὼ ἐπίσταμαι,
**29** ὃ δὲ θυμός σου, ὃν ἐθυμώθης πρὸς με, καὶ ἡ πικρία σου ἀνέ-
βη πρὸς με, καὶ ἐμβαλῶ φιμὸν εἰς τὴν ῥινά σου, καὶ χαλι-
νὸν εἰς τὰ χείλη σου, καὶ ἀποστρέψω σε τῇ ὁδῷ, ᾗ ἦλθες ἐν
**30** αὐτῇ. Τοῦτο δέ σοι τὸ σημεῖον· φάγε τοῦτον τὸν ἐνιαυτὸν ἃ
ἔσπαρκας, καὶ τῷ ἐνιαυτῷ τῷ δευτέρῳ τὸ κατάλειμμα, τῷ

### Isaiah
#### Chapter 37

**16** unto the Lord, saying, "O Lord Sabaoth, God of Israel, Who sittest upon the Cherubim, Thou alone art the God of all the kingdoms of the earth; Thou hast made the heaven and the earth.
**17** Incline, O Lord, Thine ear, and hearken; open, O Lord, Thine eyes, and behold, and see the words which Sennacherib hath sent to reproach the living God.
**18** For of a truth, O Lord, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the inhabited earth, and their [own] land,
**19** and have cast their idols into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands—wood and stone—and thus they destroyed them.'
**20** Now therefore, O Lord our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that Thou alone art God."
**21** Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, "Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel: 'I have heard that which thou hast prayed to Me concerning Sennacherib, king of Assyria.
**22** This is the word which the Lord hath spoken concerning him: "The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised thee, and mocked thee; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.
**23** Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? Even against the Holy One of Israel!
**24** For by thy messengers hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said, 'With the multitude of my chariots have I ascended to the height of the mountains, even to the uttermost parts of Lebanon; and I have cut down the tallness of its cedar, and the beauty of its cypress, and I have entered into
**25** the height of a part of the forest of Carmel; and I have made a bridge,
**26** and I have dried up waters and every gathering of water.' Hast thou not heard these things long ago, what I have done? From ancient days have I planned [it], but now have I brought it forth to lay waste nations in strongholds, and those who dwell in fortified cities.
**27** [Thus] I loosened their hands, and they withered, and they became as the green grass upon the housetops, and as wild grass that vanisheth away before it cometh to maturity.
**28** But now I know thy dwelling, and thy going out, and thy coming in,
**29** and thy rage, which thou hast raged against Me, and thy bitterness hath come up unto Me; therefore will I put a bit into thy nose, and a bridle into thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.
**30** And this shall be a sign unto thee: This year ye shall eat that which ye have sown; and in the second year, that which remaineth [from it]; and in the third year—"
