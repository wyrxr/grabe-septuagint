**ΔΑΝΙΗΛ. ΚΕΦ. Θ´.**
**2** σάν μοι τὴν ἀρχήν, καὶ ἤμην ἐν Σούσοις τῇ βάρει, ᾗ ἐστιν ἐν
**3** χώρᾳ Αἰλάμ· καὶ ἴδον ἐν δράματι, καὶ ἤμην ἐπὶ τοῦ Οὐβάλ. Καὶ
  ἦρα τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς μου· καὶ ἴδον· καὶ ἰδοὺ κριὸς εἷς ἑστηκώς,
  πρὸ τοῦ Οὐβάλ· καὶ αὐτῷ κέρατα, καὶ τὰ κέρατα ὑψηλά· καὶ
  τὸ ἓν ὑψηλότερον τοῦ ἑτέρου, καὶ τὸ ὑψηλὸν ἀνέβαινεν ἐπ᾽ ἐσχάτων.
**4** Καὶ ἴδον τὸν κριὸν κερατίζοντα κατὰ θάλασσαν, καὶ βοῤῥᾶν,
  καὶ νότον, καὶ λίβα· καὶ πάντα τὰ θηρία οὐ στήσονται
  ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ ἐξαιρούμενος ἐκ χειρὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ
**5** ἐποίησε κατὰ τὸ θέλημα αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐμεγαλύνθη. Καὶ ἐγὼ ἤμην
  συνιῶν, καὶ ἰδοὺ τράγος αἰγῶν ἤρχετο ἀπὸ λιβὸς ἐπὶ πρόσωπον
  πάσης τῆς γῆς· καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ ἁπτόμενος τῆς γῆς· καὶ τῷ τράγῳ
**6** κέρας θεωρητὸν ἀναμέσον τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἦλθεν ἕως
  τοῦ κριοῦ τοῦ τὰ κέρατα ἔχοντος, οὗ ἴδον ἑστῶτος ἐνώπιον τοῦ
**7** Οὐβάλ, καὶ ἔδραμε πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐν ὁρμῇ τῆς ἰσχύος αὐτοῦ. Καὶ
  ἴδον αὐτὸν φθάνοντα ἕως τοῦ κριοῦ, καὶ ἐξηγριώθη πρὸς αὐτόν·
  καὶ ἔπαισε τὸν κριόν, καὶ συνέτριψεν ἀμφότερα τὰ κέρατα αὐτοῦ·
  καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἰσχὺς τῷ κριῷ, τοῦ στῆναι ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ· καὶ
  ἔριψεν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, καὶ συνεπάτησεν αὐτόν, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ
**8** ἐξαιρούμενος τὸν κριὸν ἐκ χειρὸς αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ὁ τράγος τῶν αἰγῶν
  ἐμεγαλύνθη ἕως σφόδρα· καὶ ἐν τῷ ἰσχῦσαι αὐτόν, συνετρίβη
  τὸ κέρας αὐτοῦ τὸ μέγα· καὶ ἀνέβη ἕτερα κέρατα τέσσαρα
**9** ὑποκάτω αὐτοῦ εἰς τοὺς τέσσαρας ἀνέμους τοῦ οὐρανοῦ. Καὶ ἐκ
  τοῦ ἑνὸς αὐτῶν ἐξῆλθε κέρας ἓν ἰσχυρόν, καὶ ἐμεγαλύνθη περισσῶς
  πρὸς τὸν νότον, καὶ πρὸς ἀνατολήν, καὶ πρὸς τὴν δύναμιν,
**10** καὶ ἐμεγαλύνθη ἕως τῆς δυνάμεως τοῦ οὐρανοῦ· καὶ ἔπεσεν ἐπὶ
  τὴν γῆν ἀπὸ τῆς δυνάμεως τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ἄστρων,
  καὶ συνεπάτησαν αὐτά. Καὶ ἕως οὗ ὁ ἀρχιστράτηγος ῥύσηται
**11** τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν, καὶ δι᾽ αὐτὸν θυσία ἐπράχθη, καὶ ἐγενήθη, καὶ
**12** κατευοδώθη αὐτῷ· καὶ τὸ ἅγιον ἐρημωθήσεται. Καὶ ἐδόθη ἐπὶ
  τὴν θυσίαν ἁμαρτία, καὶ ἔριψε χαμαὶ ἡ δικαιοσύνη· καὶ ἐποίησε,
**13** καὶ κατευοδώθη. Καὶ ἤκουσα ἑνὸς ἁγίου λαλοῦντος· καὶ εἶπεν
  εἷς ἅγιος τῷ φελμωνί τῷ λαλοῦντι· ἕως πότε ἡ ὄρξις στήσεται
  ἡ θυσία ἡ ἀρθεῖσα, καὶ ἡ ἁμαρτία ἐρημώσεως ἡ δοθεῖσα, καὶ
**14** τὸ ἅγιον καὶ ἡ δύναμις συμπατηθήσεται; Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· ἕως
  ἑσπέρας καὶ πρωὶ ἡμέραι δισχίλιαι καὶ τριακόσιαι, καὶ καθαρισθήσεται
**15** τὸ ἅγιον. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἰδεῖν με, ἐγὼ Δανιήλ,

**8:2** They made unto me the beginning, and I was in Susa, the citadel, which is in the land of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was upon the [river] Ulai.
**3** And I lifted up mine eyes, and I saw; and, behold, there stood one ram before the Ulai; and it had horns, and the horns were high; and the one was higher than the other, and the high [horn] ascended at the last.
**4** And I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward, and southwestward; and no beasts could stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand, but he did according to his will, and he waxed great.
**5** And as I was understanding, behold, a he-goat of the goats came from the southwest upon the face of all the earth; and he touched not the earth; and the goat had a notable horn betwixt his eyes.
**6** And he came unto the ram that had the horns, whom I saw standing before the Ulai, and he ran unto him in the fury of his might.
**7** And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with rage against him, and smote the ram, and brake both his horns; and there was no strength in the ram to stand before him; but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled upon him; and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.
**8** And the he-goat of the goats waxed exceeding great; and when he was strong, his great horn was broken; and there came up four other horns in its place toward the four winds of heaven.
**9** And out of one of them came forth one exceeding strong horn, and it waxed exceeding great toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the Power.
**10** And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down to the earth some of the host of heaven and some of the stars, and did trample upon them.
**11** And until the commander-in-chief should deliver the captivity, even for his sake a sacrifice was performed, and it came to be, and it prospered unto him; and the sanctuary shall be made desolate.
**12** And sin was given upon the sacrifice, and he cast down righteousness to the ground; and he acted, and prospered.
**13** And I heard one holy [one] speaking; and one holy [one] said unto the Phelmoni who spake: How long shall the orxis stand, the sacrifice that is taken away, and the transgression of desolation that is given, and the sanctuary and the host be trampled under foot?
**14** And he said unto him, Until evening and morning two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.
**15** And it came to pass, when I, Daniel, had seen the vision,
