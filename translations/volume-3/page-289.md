τὴν νυμφίου, καὶ φωνὴν νύμφης, ὅτι εἰς ἐρήμωσιν ἔσται πᾶσα
ἡ γῆ.
ΚΕΦ. Η'. VIII.

**1** ΕΝ τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ, λέγει Κύριος, ἐξοίσουσι τὰ ὀστᾶ τῶν
    βασιλέων Ἰούδα, καὶ τὰ ὀστᾶ τῶν ἀρχόντων αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰ ὀστᾶ
    τῶν ἱερέων, καὶ τὰ ὀστᾶ τῶν προφητῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰ ὀστᾶ
    τῶν κατοικούντων Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐκ τῶν τάφων αὐτῶν,
**2** καὶ ψύξουσιν αὐτὰ πρὸς τὸν ἥλιον καὶ τὴν σελήνην, καὶ πρὸς πάντας
    τοὺς ἀστέρας, καὶ πρὸς πᾶσαν τὴν στρατιὰν τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, ἃ ἠγάπησαν, καὶ οἷς ἐδούλευσαν, καὶ ὧν ἐπορεύθησαν ὀπίσω αὐτῶν,
    καὶ ὧν ἀντείχοντο, καὶ οἷς προσεκύνησαν αὐτοῖς· οὐ κοπήσονται,
    καὶ οὐ ταφήσονται, καὶ ἔσονται εἰς παράδειγμα ἐπὶ προσώπου
    τῆς γῆς, ὅτι εἵλαντο τὸν θάνατον μᾶλλον ἢ τὴν ζωήν,
**3** καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς καταλοίποις τοῖς καταλειφθεῖσιν ἀπὸ τῆς γενεᾶς ἐκείνης πονήρας, ἐν παντὶ τόπῳ οὗ ἐὰν ἐξώσω αὐτοὺς ἐκεῖ, λέγει Κύριος
    τῶν δυνάμεων.
**4** Καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτοὺς· ὅτι τάδε λέγει Κύριος·
    μὴ ὁ πίπτων οὐκ ἀνίσταται; ἢ ὁ ἀποστρέφων οὐκ ἐπιστρέφει;
**5** Διαιτὶ ἀπέστρεψεν ὁ λαὸς οὗτος Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἀποστροφὴν ἀναιδῆ,
    καὶ κατεκρατήθησαν ἐν τῇ προαιρέσει αὐτῶν, καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησαν
    τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι;
**6** Ἐνωτίσασθε δή, καὶ ἀκούσατε· οὐχ οὕτως λαλήσουσιν, οὐκ ἔστιν ἄνθρωπος μετανοῶν ἀπὸ τῆς κακίας αὐτοῦ,
    λέγων, τί ἐποίησα; διέλειπεν ὁ τρέχων ἐκ τοῦ δρόμου αὐτοῦ, ὡς
    ἵππος κάθιδρος ἐν χρεμετισμῷ αὐτοῦ.
**7** Καὶ ἡ ἀσίδα ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ ἔγνω τὸν καιρὸν αὐτῆς· τρυγὼν καὶ χελιδὼν ἀγροῦ, στρουθία ἐφύλαξαν καιροὺς εἰσόδου αὐτῶν· ὁ δὲ λαός μου οὐκ ἔγνω
    τὰ κρίματα Κυρίου.
**8** Πῶς ἐρεῖτε ὅτι σοφοί ἐσμεν ἡμεῖς, καὶ νόμος Κυρίου μεθ᾿ ἡμῶν ἐστιν; εἰς μάτην ἐγενήθη σχῖνος ψευδὴς
    γραμματεύσιν.
**9** Ἠσχύνθησαν σοφοί, καὶ ἐπτοήθησαν καὶ ἐάλωσαν,
    ὅτι τὸν λόγον Κυρίου ἀπεδοκίμασαν· σοφία τίς ἐστιν ἐν αὐτοῖς;
**10** διὰ τοῦτο δώσω τὰς γυναῖκας αὐτῶν ἑτέροις, καὶ τοὺς ἀγροὺς
    αὐτῶν τοῖς κληρονόμοις· ὅτι ἀπὸ μικροῦ ἕως μεγάλου πάντες
    φιλαργυρίαν ἀποδιώκουσι, καὶ ἐκ προφήτου ἕως ἱερέως πάντες
    ποιοῦσι ψεῦδος.
**11** Καὶ ἰατρεύοντο τὸ σύντριμμα θυγατρὸς τοῦ λαοῦ
    μου πρὸς ἀτιμίαν, λέγοντες, εἰρήνη, εἰρήνη, καὶ οὐκ ἦν εἰρήνη.

[of] the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride; for the whole land shall be laid waste.

CHAPTER VIII.

**1** In that time, saith the Lord, shall they bring forth the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of their prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem out of their graves.
**2** And they shall expose them before the sun, and the moon, and before all the stars, and before all the host of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they have held fast, and whom they have worshipped. They shall not be gathered, nor shall they be buried; but they shall be for an example upon the face of the earth, because they have chosen death rather than life.
**3** And [so it shall be] to all the remainder of them that are left of that evil generation in every place where I shall cast them out, saith the Lord of hosts.
**4** And thou shalt say unto them: "Thus saith the Lord: Shall not he that falleth rise again? Or shall not he that turneth away return?"
**5** Wherefore then hath this people of Jerusalem turned away with an unashamed turning, and they have been held fast in their own choice, and they would not return?
**6** Give ear, I pray you, and hearken! They shall not speak thus; there is no man repenting from his wickedness, saying, "What have I done?" He that runneth hath failed from his course, as a horse sweating in its neighing.
**7** Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed time; the turtle-dove and the swallow of the field, [and] the sparrows have observed the seasons of their coming; but My people know not the judgments of the Lord.
**8** How will ye say, "We are wise, and the Law of the Lord is with us?" In vain was the false pen made for scribes.
**9** The wise men were ashamed, and they were dismayed and taken, because they have rejected the word of the Lord; what wisdom is there in them?
**10** Therefore will I give their wives to others, and their fields to those who inherit them; for from the least even unto the greatest, every one pursueth covetousness, and from the prophet even unto the priest, every one practiceth falsehood.
**11** And they healed the wound of the daughter of My people superficially, saying, "Peace, peace!" but there was no peace.
