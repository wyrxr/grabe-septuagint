ΚΕΦ. ΚΓʹ.
μήμασιν αὐτῆς ἐμιαίνετο. Καὶ τὴν πορνείαν αὐτῆς ἐξ Αἰγύπτου 8
οὐκ ἐγκατέλειπεν, ὅτι μετ᾿ αὐτῆς ἐκοιμῶντο ἐν τῇ νεότητι αὐτῆς,
καὶ αὐτοὶ διεπαρθένευσαν αὐτήν, καὶ ἐξέχεαν τὴν πορνείαν αὐτῶν
ἐπ᾿ αὐτήν. Διὰ τοῦτο παρέδωκα αὐτὴν εἰς χεῖρας τῶν ἐραστῶν αὐ- 9
τῆς, εἰς χεῖρας υἱῶν Ἀσσυρίων, ἐφ᾿ οὓς ἐπετίθετο. Αὐτοὶ ἀπεκά- 10
λυψαν τὴν αἰσχύνην αὐτῆς, υἱοὺς καὶ θυγατέρας αὐτῆς ἔλαβον,
καὶ αὐτὴν ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ ἀπέκτειναν· καὶ ἐγένετο λάλημα εἰς τὰς γυ-
ναῖκας, καὶ ἐποίησαν ἐκδικήσεις ἐν αὐτῇ εἰς τὰς θυγατέρας αὐτῆς.
Καὶ εἶδεν ἡ ἀδελφὴ αὐτῆς ἡ Ὀολιβά, καὶ διέφθειρε τὴν ἐπίθεσιν αὐ- 11
τῆς ὑπὲρ αὐτήν, καὶ τὴν πορνείαν αὐτῆς ὑπὲρ τὴν πορνείαν τῆς ἀ-
δελφῆς αὐτῆς. Ἐπὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς τῶν Ἀσσυρίων ἐπέθετο ἡγουμέ- 12
νους καὶ στρατηγοὺς τοὺς ἐγγὺς αὐτῆς ἐνδεδυμένους εὐπάρυφα, ἵπ-
πεῖς ἱππαζόμενοι ἐφ᾿ ἵππων, νεανίσκοι ἐπίλεκτοι πάντες. Καὶ εἶ- 13
δον, ὅτι μεμίανται ὁδὸς μία τῶν δύο, καὶ προσέθετο πρὸς τὴν 14
πορνείαν αὐτῆς, καὶ εἶδεν ἄνδρας ἐξωγραφημένους ἐπὶ τοῦ τοίχου,
εἰκόνας Χαλδαίων ἐξωγραφημένους, ἐν γραφίδι διεζωσμένους ποι- 15
κίλματα ἐπὶ τὰς ὀσφύας αὐτῶν, καὶ τιάραι βαπταὶ ἐπὶ τῶν κεφα-
λῶν αὐτῶν, ὄψις τρισσὴ πάντων, ὁμοίωμα υἱῶν Χαλδαίων, γῆς
πατρίδος αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐπέθετο ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς ἐν ὁράσει ὀφθαλμῶν αὐ- 16
τῆς· καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν ἀγγέλους πρὸς αὐτοὺς εἰς γῆν Χαλδαίων.
Καὶ ἦλθον πρὸς αὐτὴν υἱοὶ Βαβυλῶνος, εἰς κοίτην καταλυόντων, καὶ 17
ἐμίανον αὐτὴν ἐν τῇ πορνείᾳ αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐμιάνθη ἐν αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἀπέ-
στη ἡ ψυχὴ αὐτῆς ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἀπεκάλυψε τὴν πορνείαν αὐτῆς, 18
ἀπεκάλυψε τὴν αἰσχύνην αὐτῆς· καὶ ἀπέστη ἡ ψυχὴ μου ἀπ᾿ αὐτῆς, ὃν
τρόπον ἀπέστη ἡ ψυχή μου ἀπὸ τῆς ἀδελφῆς αὐτῆς. Καὶ ἐπλήθυνας τὴν 19
πορνείαν σου, τοῦ ἀναμνῆσαι ἡμέρας νεότητός σου, ἐν αἷς ἐπόρνευσας ἐν 20
Αἰγύπτῳ, καὶ ἐπέθου ἐπὶ τοὺς Χαλδαίους, ὧν ἦσαν ὡς ὄνων αἱ σάρκες
αὐτῶν, καὶ αἰδοῖα ἵππων τὰ αἰδοῖα αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπεσκέψω τὴν ἀνομίαν 21
νεότητός σου, ἃ ἐποίεις ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ ἐν τῷ καταλύματί σου, οὗ οἱ μα-
στοὶ ἔπεσαν νεότητός σου. Διὰ τοῦτο Ὀολιβά, τάδε λέγει Κύριος 22
Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἐπὶ σέ, Ὀολιβά· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐξεγείρω τοὺς ἐραστάς
σου ἐπὶ σέ, ἀφ᾿ ὧν ἀπέστη ἡ ψυχή σου ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν· καὶ ἐπάξω αὐ-
τοὺς ἐπὶ σὲ κυκλόθεν υἱοὺς Βαβυλῶνος, καὶ πάντας τοὺς Χαλδαί- 23
ους, Φακούχ, καὶ Σουέ, καὶ Ὠχουέ, καὶ πάντας τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἀσ-
συρίων μετ᾿ αὐτῶν, νεανίσκους ἐπιλέκτους, ἡγεμόνας καὶ στρατη-
γοὺς, πάντας τρισσοὺς καὶ ὀνομαστούς, ἱππεύοντας ἐφ᾿ ἵππων πάν-

**7** ... in all her [lustful] thoughts she was defiled.
**8** And her whoredom from Egypt did she not forsake, for with her did they lie down in her youth, and they themselves did violate her virginity, and poured out their whoredom upon her.
**9** Therefore have I delivered her into the hands of her lovers, even into the hands of the sons of Assyria, upon whom she lusted.
**10** They uncovered her shame; her sons and her daughters they took, and her they slew with the sword. And she became a byword among women, and they executed vengeance upon her among her daughters.
**11** And her sister Oholibah saw [this], and she corrupted her lust even beyond her, and her whoredom beyond the whoredom of her sister.
**12** She lusted after the sons of the Assyrians, governors and captains, those nigh unto her, clothed in rich robes, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them choice young men.
**13** And I saw that the way of both was defiled, and she added unto her whoredom.
**14** For she saw men depicted upon the wall, images of Chaldeans portrayed,
**15** girded with [painted] adornments upon their loins, and dyed turbans upon their heads; a noble visage [was upon] all of them, the likeness of the sons of Chaldea, the land of their nativity.
**16** And she lusted after them at the sight of her eyes; and she sent messengers unto them into the land of the Chaldeans.
**17** And the sons of Babylon came unto her, unto a bed for lodging, and they defiled her with their whoredom; and she was defiled by them, and her soul turned away from them.
**18** And she uncovered her whoredom, she uncovered her shame; and My soul turned away from her, in the manner that My soul turned away from her sister.
**19** And thou didst multiply thy whoredom, to call to remembrance the days of thy youth, wherein thou committedst whoredom in
**20** Egypt; and thou didst lust after the Chaldeans, whose flesh was as the flesh of asses, and whose genitals were as the genitals of horses.
**21** And thou didst revisit the iniquity of thy youth, which thou didst commit in Egypt in thy lodging place, where thy breasts were pressed in thy youth.
**22** Therefore, Oholibah, thus saith the Lord, the Lord God, concerning thee, Oholibah: Behold, I will stir up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy soul hath turned away; and I will bring them against thee roundabout,
**23** even the sons of Babylon, and all the Chaldeans; Pakuch, and Shoueh, and Okhoueh, and all the sons of Assyria with them, choice young men, governors and captains, all of them noble and renowned, all riding upon horses.
