καλαμῶνται ὑμᾶς, καὶ οἱ ἀπαιτοῦντες κυριεύουσιν ὑμῶν· λαός

**9** And they have declared and revealed their sin as Sodom's.
Woe to their soul!
**10** For they have devised evil counsel against themselves,
Saying, "Let us bind the righteous one, for he is unprofitable to us."
Therefore shall they eat the fruit of their own works.
**11** Woe to the lawless one! Evil things, according to the works of his hands, shall befall him.
**12** O My people, your exactors do fleece you,
And those that demand tribute do rule over you;
O My people, they that call you blessed do lead you astray,
And trouble the path of your feet.
**13** But now shall the Lord stand to judgment,
**14** And shall set His people for judgment.
The Lord Himself shall come to judgment with the elders of the people,
And with its rulers:
"Ye, why have ye burned up My vineyard?
And is the spoil of the poor in your houses?
**15** Why do ye wrong My people, and shame the face of the poor?"
Saith the Lord, the Lord of Sabaoth.
**16** Thus saith the Lord:
"Because the daughters of Zion are lifted up,
And have walked with a high neck and with winks of the eyes,
And with the movement of their feet dragging their garments,
**17** And at the same time mincing with their feet;
Therefore shall the Lord God humble the ruling daughters of Zion,
And the Lord shall uncover their private parts in that day.
**18** And the Lord shall take away the glory of their apparel, and their ornaments:
The plaits, and the fringes, and the crescents,
**19** The pendants, and the ornament of their face,
And the elaborate setting of the ornament of their glory,
**20** And the armlets, and the anklets, and the plaited hair,
**21** And the armbands, and the rings, and the earrings,
**22** And the purple robes, and the half-purple robes,
And the coverings for the house,
**23** And the transparent Laconian garments, and the fine linen,
And the hyacinth-colored, and the scarlet,
And the fine linen fabric itself,
Woven together with gold and hyacinth,
**24** And reclining couches for summer.
And it shall be, instead of sweet perfume, [there shall be] dust;
And instead of a girdle, thou shalt gird thyself with a rope;
And instead of the golden ornament of the head,
Thou shalt have baldness because of thy works;
**25** And instead of the mid-purple tunic, thou shalt gird thyself with sackcloth.
And thy most beautiful son, whom thou lovest, shall fall by the sword,
And your strong men shall fall by the sword, and they shall be humbled.
**26** And the coffers of your glory shall mourn,
And thou shalt be left desolate and shalt be cast down to the earth."
