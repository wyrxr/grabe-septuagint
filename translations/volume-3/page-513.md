ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν βασιλεὺς τοῦ βορρᾶ ἐν ἅρμασι καὶ ἐν ἱππεῦσι, καὶ ἐν
ναυσὶ πολλαῖς, καὶ εἰσελεύσεται εἰς τὴν γῆν, καὶ συντρίψει καὶ
παρελεύσεται. Καὶ εἰσελεύσεται εἰς τὴν γῆν τοῦ Σαβαείμ, καὶ 41
πολλοὶ ἀσθενήσουσι· καὶ οὗτοι διασωθήσονται ἐκ χειρὸς αὐτοῦ,
Ἐδὼμ, καὶ Μωὰβ, καὶ ἀρχὴ υἱῶν Ἀμμών. Καὶ ἐκτενεῖ τὴν χεῖ- 42
ρα αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, καὶ γῆ Αἰγύπτου οὐκ ἔσται εἰς σωτηρίαν.
Καὶ κυριεύσει ἐν τοῖς ἀποκρύφοις τοῦ χρυσίου καὶ τοῦ ἀργυρίου, 43
καὶ ἐν πᾶσιν ἐπιθυμητοῖς Αἰγύπτου, καὶ Λιβύων, καὶ Αἰθιόπων
ἐν τοῖς ὀχυρώμασιν αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἀκοαὶ καὶ σπουδαὶ ταράξουσιν 44
αὐτὸν ἐξ ἀνατολῶν καὶ ἀπὸ βορρᾶ· καὶ ἥξει ἐν θυμῷ πολλῷ, τοῦ
ἀφανίσαι, καὶ τοῦ ἀναθεματίσαι πολλούς. Καὶ πήξει τὴν σκηνὴν 45
αὐτοῦ Ἐφραδανὼ, ἀναμέσον τῶν θαλασσῶν, εἰς ὄρος Σαβεὶν ἅγιον,
καὶ ἥξει ἕως μέρους (ὄρους) αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ὁ ῥυόμενος αὐτόν.

**ΚΕΦ. ΙΒ´. ΧΙΙ.**

ΚΑὶ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ ἀναστήσεται Μιχαὴλ ὁ ἄρχων ὁ 1
μέγας ὁ ἑστηκὼς ἐπὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς τοῦ λαοῦ σου· καὶ ἔσται καιρὸς
θλίψεως, θλίψις οἵα οὐ γέγονεν, ἀφ᾿ οὗ γεγένηται ἔθνος ἐπὶ τῆς
γῆς, ἕως τοῦ καιροῦ ἐκείνου· καὶ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ σωθήσεται
ὁ λαός σου πᾶς ὁ εὑρεθεὶς ὁ γεγραμμένος ἐν τῇ βίβλῳ, καὶ 2
πολλοὶ τῶν καθευδόντων ἐν γῆς χώματι ἐγερθήσονται, οὗτοι εἰς
ζωὴν αἰώνιον, καὶ οὗτοι εἰς ὀνειδισμὸν καὶ εἰς αἰσχύνην αἰώνιον.
Καὶ οἱ συνιέντες ἐκλάμψουσιν ὡς ἡ λαμπρότης τοῦ στερεώμα- 3
τος, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν δικαίων τῶν πολλῶν ὡς οἱ ἀστέρες εἰς τοὺς
αἰῶνας, καὶ ἔτι. Καὶ σὺ Δανιὴλ ἔμφραξον τοὺς λόγους, καὶ σφρά- 4
γισον τὸ βιβλίον ἕως καιροῦ συντελείας, ἕως διδαχθῶσι πολλοὶ,
καὶ πληθυνθῇ ἡ γνῶσις. Καὶ ἰδὼν ἐγὼ Δανιὴλ, καὶ ἰδοὺ δύο ἕ- 5
τεροι εἰστήκεισαν, καὶ εἷς ἐντεῦθεν τοῦ χείλους τοῦ ποταμοῦ, καὶ
εἷς ἐντεῦθεν τοῦ χείλους τοῦ ποταμοῦ. Καὶ εἶπε τῷ ἀνδρὶ τῷ 6
ἐνδεδυμένῳ τὰ Βαδδὶμ, ὃς ἦν ἐπάνω τοῦ ὕδατος τοῦ ποταμοῦ, ἕως
πότε τὸ πέρας ὧν εἴρηκας τῶν θαυμασίων; Καὶ ἤκουσα τοῦ ἀν- 7
δρὸς τοῦ ἐνδεδυμένου τὰ Βαδδὶν, ὃς ἦν ἐπάνω τοῦ ὕδατος τοῦ πο-
ταμοῦ, καὶ ὕψωσε τὴν δεξιὰν αὐτοῦ καὶ τὴν ἀριστεράν αὐτοῦ εἰς
τὸν οὐρανὸν, καὶ ὤμοσεν ἐν τῷ ζῶντι εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, ἔτι εἰς
καιρὸν καὶ καιροὺς καὶ εἰς ἥμισυ καιροῦ ἐν τῷ συντελέσαι δια-

**Chapter 11**

**40** upon him shall the king of the North come with chariots and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the land, and shall crush and pass through.
**41** And he shall enter into the land of Sabaeim, and many shall be weakened; but these shall be delivered out of his hand: Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the sons of Ammon.
**42** And he shall stretch forth his hand upon the land, and the land of Egypt shall not be for safety.
**43** And he shall have power over the hidden treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the desirable things of Egypt; and the Libyans and the Ethiopians [shall be] in their strongholds.
**44** And tidings and rumors shall trouble him from the east and from the north; and he shall come forth with great fury, to make utterly desolate, and to anathematize many.
**45** And he shall pitch the tabernacle of his palace in Ephradano, between the seas, in Mount Savein, the holy [mountain]; and he shall come even unto a [mountain-]part thereof, and there shall be none to deliver him.

**Chapter 12**

**1** And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince who standeth for the sons of thy people; and there shall be a time of tribulation, such tribulation as there hath not been since a nation was upon the earth, until that time; and at that time thy people shall be saved, every one that is found, that is written in the book.
**2** And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to life everlasting, and some to reproach and to everlasting shame.
**3** And they that understand shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and those of the righteous, even the many, [shall shine] as the stars, unto the ages, and yet [more].
**4** But thou, Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book until the time of the end, until many shall be taught, and knowledge shall be multiplied.
**5** And I, Daniel, seeing, and behold, two others stood, one on this side of the bank of the river, and one on that side of the bank of the river.
**6** And [one] said to the man clothed in Baddim, who was upon the waters of the river, "How long shall be the end of these wondrous things which thou hast spoken?"
**7** And I heard the man clothed in Baddim, who was upon the waters of the river, and he lifted up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and swore by Him that liveth for ever, "Until yet a time, and for times, and for half a time; when the dispersion of the holy people shall be accomplished, then shall all these things be known."
