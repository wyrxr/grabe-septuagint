μου ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς· ἕως τίνος οὐ μὴ δύνανται καθαρισθῆναι ἐν τῷ
**6** Ἰσραήλ; Καὶ αὐτὸ τέκτων ἐποίησε, καὶ οὐ Θεός ἐστι· διότι πλανῶν
**7** ἦν ὁ μόσχος σου Σαμάρεια. Ὅτι ἀνεμόφθορα ἔσπειραν, καὶ
  ἡ καταστροφὴ αὐτῶν ἐκδέξεται αὐτά· δράγμα οὐκ ἔχον ἰσχὺν τοῦ
  ποιῆσαι ἄλευρον, ἐὰν δὲ καὶ ποιήσῃ, ἀλλότριοι καταφάγονται αὐ-
**8** τό. Κατεπόθη Ἰσραήλ, νῦν ἐγένετο ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν ὡς σκεῦος
**9** ἄχρηστον· ὅτι αὐτοὶ ἀνέβησαν εἰς Ἀσσυρίους. Ἀνέβαλε καθ᾿
**10** ἑαυτὸν Ἐφραίμ, δῶρα ἠγάπησαν· διὰ τοῦτο παραδοθήσονται ἐν
  τοῖς ἔθνεσι. Νῦν εἰσδέξομαι αὐτοὺς, καὶ κοπάσουσι μικρὸν τοῦ
**11** χρεῖον βασιλέα καὶ ἄρχοντας. Ὅτι ἐπλήθυνεν Ἐφραὶμ θυσια-
  στήρια, εἰς ἁμαρτίαν ἐγένοντο αὐτῷ θυσιαστήρια τὰ ἠγαπημένα.
**12** Καταγράψω αὐτῷ πλῆθος καὶ τὰ νόμιμα αὐτοῦ, εἰς ἀλλότρια
**13** ἐλογίσθησαν θυσιαστήρια τὰ ἠγαπημένα. Διότι ἐὰν θύσωσι θυσίαν,
  καὶ φάγωσι κρέα, Κύριος οὐ προσδέξεται αὐτά· νῦν μνησθήσεται
  τὰς ἀδικίας αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐκδικήσει τὰς ἁμαρτίας αὐτῶν. Αὐτοὶ δὲ εἰς
**14** Αἴγυπτον ἀπέστρεψαν, καὶ ἐν Ἀσσυρίοις ἀκάθαρτα φάγονται· καὶ
  ἐπελάθετο Ἰσραὴλ τοῦ ποιήσαντος αὐτὸν, καὶ ᾠκοδόμησαν τεμένη.
  Καὶ Ἰούδας ἐπλήθυνε πόλεις τετειχισμένας· καὶ ἐξαποστελῶ πῦρ
  εἰς τὰς πόλεις αὐτοῦ, καὶ καταφάγεται τὰ θεμέλια αὐτοῦ.

**ΚΕΦ. Θ'. ΙΧ.**
**1** Μὴ χαῖρε Ἰσραὴλ, μηδὲ εὐφραίνου καθὼς οἱ λαοὶ, διότι ἐπόρνευσας
  ἀπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ σου· ἠγάπησας δόματα ἐπὶ πάντα ἅλωνα
**2** σίτου. Ἄλων καὶ ληνὸς οὐκ ἔγνω αὐτοὺς, καὶ ὁ οἶνος ἐψεύσατο
**3** αὐτούς. Οὐ κατώκησαν ἐν τῇ γῇ τοῦ Κυρίου· κατώκησεν Ἐφραὶμ
**4** εἰς Αἴγυπτον, καὶ ἐν Ἀσσυρίοις ἀκάθαρτα φάγονται. Οὐκ ἔσπεισαν
  τῷ Κυρίῳ οἶνον, καὶ οὐχ ἡδύναντο αὐτῷ αἱ θυσίαι αὐτῶν·
  ὡς ἄρτος πένθους αὐτοῖς, πάντες οἱ ἔσθοντες αὐτὰ μιανθήσον-
  ται· διότι οἱ ἄρτοι αὐτῶν ταῖς ψυχαῖς αὐτῶν, οὐκ εἰσελεύσονται
**5** εἰς τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου. Τί ποιήσετε ἐν ἡμέρᾳ πανηγυρήσεως, καὶ
**6** ἐν ἡμέραις ἑορτῆς τοῦ Κυρίου; Διὰ τοῦτο ἰδοὺ πορεύονται ἐκ ταλαιπωρίας
  Αἰγύπτου, καὶ ἐκδέξεται αὐτοὺς Μέμφις, καὶ θάψει
  αὐτοὺς Μαχμάς· τὸ ἀργύριον αὐτῶν ὄλεθρος κληρονομήσει, ἄ-
**7** κανθαι ἐν τοῖς σκηνώμασιν αὐτῶν. Ἥκασιν αἱ ἡμέραι τῆς ἐκδι-
  κήσεώς σου, ἥκασιν αἱ ἡμέραι τῆς ἀνταποδόσεώς σου, καὶ κακω-
  θήσεται Ἰσραὴλ ὥσπερ ὁ προφήτης ὁ παρεξεστηκὼς, ἄνθρωπος

**HOSEA**
**CHAPTER 8**

**5** ...My wrath upon them. How long shall they not be able to be purified within Israel?
**6** For a craftsman made it, and it is not God; for deceiving was thy calf, O Samaria!
**7** For they have sown wind-blown things, and their destruction shall receive them. The sheaf hath no strength to make flour; if it make, yet strangers shall devour it.
**8** Israel is swallowed up; now is he become among the nations as a vessel without use.
**9** For they themselves went up unto the Assyrians. Ephraim made overtures for himself; they loved gifts.
**10** Therefore shall they be delivered among the nations. Now will I receive them, and they shall cease for a short time from their need for a king and rulers.
**11** For Ephraim hath multiplied altars, and unto sin did his beloved altars become for him.
**12** I will write for him the multitude and his statutes, but as strange [things] were accounted his beloved altars.
**13** For if they sacrifice a sacrifice, and eat flesh, the Lord will not accept them. Now will He remember their iniquities, and avenge their sins. But they have returned unto Egypt, and in Assyria shall they eat unclean things.
**14** And Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and they have built temples. And Judah hath multiplied walled cities; but I will send forth fire into his cities, and it shall consume his foundations.

**CHAPTER 9**

**1** Rejoice not, O Israel, neither exult as other peoples; because thou hast prostituted thyself from thy God. Thou hast loved gifts upon every threshing-floor of corn.
**2** The threshing-floor and the winepress knew them not, and the wine hath deceived them.
**3** They did not dwell in the land of the Lord; Ephraim hath dwelt in Egypt, and in Assyria shall they eat unclean things.
**4** They poured not out wine unto the Lord, neither were their sacrifices sweet unto Him. As bread of mourning [were they] unto them; all that eat them shall be defiled. For their bread is for their souls; it shall not enter into the house of the Lord.
**5** What shall ye do in the day of assembly, and in the days of the feast of the Lord?
**6** Therefore, behold, they go forth from the misery of Egypt, and Memphis shall receive them, and Machmas shall bury them. Destruction shall inherit their silver, and thorns [shall grow] in their tabernacles.
**7** The days of thy vengeance are come, the days of thy recompense are come; and Israel shall be afflicted as the prophet that is beside himself, a man...
