ΚΕΦ. Β´.
¹³ Καὶ ἀπεκρίθησαν οἱ ἱερεῖς, καὶ εἶπαν· οὔ. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἀγγαῖος·
ἐὰν ἅψηται μεμιαμμένος ἢ ἀκάθαρτος ψυχὴ (ἐπὶ ψυχῇ) ἐπὶ παντὸς
τούτων, εἰ μιανθήσεται; Καὶ ἀπεκρίθησαν οἱ ἱερεῖς, καὶ εἶ-
¹⁴ παν· μιανθήσεται. Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Ἀγγαῖος, καὶ εἶπεν· οὕτως ὁ
λαὸς οὗτος, καὶ οὕτως τὸ ἔθνος τοῦτο ἐνώπιον ἐμοῦ, λέγει Κύριος,
καὶ οὕτως πάντα τὰ ἔργα τῶν χειρῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ ὃς ἐὰν ἐγγίσῃ
ἐκεῖ, μιανθήσεται ἕνεκεν τῶν λημμάτων αὐτῶν τῶν ὀρθρινῶν· ὀδυ-
νηθήσονται ἀπὸ προσώπου πόνων αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐμισεῖτε ἐν πύλαις
ἐλέγχοντας.
¹⁵ Καὶ νῦν θέσθε δὴ ἐπὶ τὰς καρδίας ὑμῶν ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης
καὶ ἐπάνω, πρὸ τοῦ θεῖναι
¹⁶ λίθον ἐπὶ λίθον ἐν τῷ ναῷ Κυρίου, τίνες ἦτε, ὅτε ἐνεβάλλετε εἰς
κυψέλην κριθῆς εἴκοσι σάτα, καὶ ἐγένετο κριθῆς δέκα σάτα, καὶ
εἰσεπορεύεσθε εἰς τὸ ὑπολήνιον ἐξαντλῆσαι πεντήκοντα μετρητάς,
¹⁷ καὶ ἐγένετο εἴκοσι. Ἐπάταξα ὑμᾶς ἐν ἀφορίᾳ καὶ ἐν ἀνεμοφθορίᾳ,
καὶ ἐν χαλάζῃ πάντα τὰ ἔργα τῶν χειρῶν ὑμῶν, καὶ οὐκ
¹⁸ ἐπεστρέψατε πρὸς μέ, λέγει Κύριος. Τάξατε δὴ τὰς καρδίας ὑμῶν
ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης καὶ ἐπέκεινα, ἀπὸ τῆς τετράδος καὶ εἰκάδος
τοῦ ἐνάτου μηνός, καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέρας ἧς ἐθεμελιώθη ὁ
¹⁹ ναὸς Κυρίου· θέσθε ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ὑμῶν, εἰ ἔτι ἐπιγνωσθήσεται
ἐπὶ τῆς ἄλω, καὶ εἰ ἔτι ἡ ἄμπελος, καὶ ἡ συκῆ, καὶ ἡ ροά, καὶ
τὰ ξύλα τῆς ἐλαίας τὰ οὐ φέροντα καρπόν; ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέρας
²⁰ ταύτης (καὶ ἐπάνω) εὐλογήσω αὐτά. Καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου
ἐκ δευτέρου πρὸς Ἀγγαῖον τὸν προφήτην τετράδι καὶ εἰκάδι τοῦ
²¹ μηνός, λέγων· εἰπὸν πρὸς Ζοροβάβελ τὸν τοῦ Σαλαθιὴλ ἐκ φυλῆς
Ἰούδα, λέγων· ἐγὼ σείω τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ τὴν γῆν, καὶ τὴν θά-
²² λασσαν καὶ τὴν ξηράν, καὶ καταστρέψω θρόνους βασιλέων, καὶ
ἐξολεθρεύσω δύναμιν βασιλέων τῶν ἐθνῶν, καὶ καταστρέψω ἅρματα
καὶ ἀναβάτας, (καὶ καταστρέψω πᾶσαν τὴν δύναμιν αὐτῶν, καὶ
καταβαλῶ τὰ ὅρια αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐνισχύσω τοὺς ἐκλεκτούς μου,) καὶ
καταβήσονται ἵπποι καὶ ἀναβάται αὐτῶν, ἕκαστος
²³ ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ πρὸς τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ. Ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, λέγει
Κύριος παντοκράτωρ, λήψομαί σε Ζοροβάβελ τὸν δοῦλόν μου, λέγει
Κύριος, καὶ θήσομαί σε ὡς σφραγῖδα, ὅτι σὲ ἡρέτισα, λέγει Κύριος
παντοκράτωρ.

**13** And the priests answered and said, "Nay." Then said Haggai, "If one that is defiled, or an unclean soul (upon a soul), do touch any of these things, shall it be made unclean?" And the priests answered and said,
**14** "It shall be made unclean." Then answered Haggai and said, "So is this people, and so is this nation before Me," saith the Lord; "and so are all the works of their hands; and whatsoever they shall bring nigh there, it shall be made unclean, because of their morning offerings. They shall be pained by reason of the toil of their works, and ye hated them that reproved in the gates."
**15** "And now, consider ye in your hearts from this day and upward, before [ye] lay
**16** a stone upon a stone in the temple of the Lord, what ye were, when ye cast [seed] into a basket of barley [for] twenty seahs, and there were [but] ten seahs of barley; and when ye entered into the winepress vat to draw out fifty measures,
**17** and there were [but] twenty. I have smitten you with barrenness and with blast, and with hail, [afflicting] all the works of your hands; yet ye turned not
**18** unto Me," saith the Lord. "Set now your hearts from this day and onward, even from the four and twentieth [day]
**19** of the ninth month, and from the day that the temple of the Lord was founded; consider ye in your hearts: if it shall yet be known upon the threshing floor, and if yet the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive trees, those which bore no fruit? From this day (and onward) I will bless them."
**20** And again the word of the Lord came unto Haggai the prophet on the twenty-fourth day of the month, saying:
**21** "Speak unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, of the tribe of Judah, saying: 'I will shake the heaven and the earth, and the sea
**22** and the dry land; and I will overthrow the thrones of kings, and I will utterly destroy the might of the kings of the nations; and I will overthrow the chariots and those that ride thereon (yea, I will overthrow all their power, and I will cast down their boundaries, and I will strengthen My elect ones); and horses and their riders shall go down, each man
**23** with his sword against his brother. In that day," saith the Lord Almighty, "I will take thee, O Zerubbabel My servant," saith the Lord, "and I will make thee as a signet ring; for I have chosen thee," saith the Lord Almighty.'"
