καμάραν τὸν οὐρανόν, καὶ διατείνας αὐτὸν ὡς σκηνὴν κατοικεῖν,
ὁ διδούς ἄρχοντας εἰς οὐδὲν ἄρχειν, τὴν δὲ γῆν ὡς οὐδὲν ἐ- 23
ποίησεν. Οὐ γὰρ μὴ σπείρωσιν, οὐδὲ μὴ φυτεύσωσιν, οὐδὲ μὴ 24
ῥιζωθῇ εἰς τὴν γῆν ἡ ῥίζα αὐτῶν· ἔπνευσεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς, καὶ
ἐξηράνθησαν, καὶ καταιγὶς ὡς φρύγανα ἀναλήψεται αὐτούς.
Νῦν οὖν τίνι με ὡμοιώσατε, καὶ ὑψωθήσομαι ; εἶπεν ὁ ἅγιος, 25
Ἀναβλέψατε εἰς τὸ ὕψος τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς ὑμῶν, καὶ ἴδετε, 26
τίς κατέδειξε πάντα ταῦτα; ὁ ἐκφέρων κατὰ ἀριθμὸν τὸν
κόσμον αὐτοῦ, πάντα ἐπ᾿ ὀνόματι καλέσει ἀπὸ τῆς πολλῆς
δόξης, καὶ ἐν κράτει ἰσχύος οὐδὲν σε ἔλαβε. Μὴ γὰρ εἴπῃς 27
Ἰακώβ, καὶ τί ἐλάλησας Ἰσραήλ; ἀπεκρύβη ἡ ὁδός μου ἀπὸ
τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ ὁ Θεός μου τὴν κρίσιν μου ἀφεῖλε, καὶ ἀπέστη.
Καὶ νῦν οὐκ ἔγνως; εἰ μὴ ἤκουσας; Θεὸς αἰώνιος, Θεὸς ὁ 28
κατασκευάσας τὰ ἄκρα τῆς γῆς, οὐ πεινάσει, οὐδὲ κοπιάσει,
οὐδὲ ἔστιν ἐξεύρεσις τῆς φρονήσεως αὐτοῦ, διδοὺς τοῖς πεινῶ- 29
σιν ἰσχὺν, καὶ τοῖς μὴ ὀδυνωμένοις λύπην. Πεινάσουσι γὰρ νεώ- 30
τεροι, καὶ κοπιάσουσι νεανίσκοι, καὶ ἔκλεκτοι ἀνίσχυες ἔσονται.
Οἱ δὲ ὑπομένοντες τὸν Θεὸν ἀλλάξουσιν ἰσχὺν, πτεροφυήσουσιν 31
ὡς ἀετοὶ, δραμοῦνται καὶ οὐ κοπιάσουσι, βαδιοῦνται καὶ οὐ
πεινάσουσιν.

ΕΓΚΑΙΝΙΖΕΣΘΕ πρὸς με, νῆσοι, οἱ γὰρ ἄρχοντες ἀλλάξου- 1
σιν ἰσχὺν· ἐγγισάτωσαν καὶ λαλησάτωσαν ἅμα, τότε κρίσιν ἀναγ-
γειλάτωσαν. Τίς ἐξεγείρει ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν δικαιοσύνην, ἐκάλεσεν αὐ- 2
τὴν κατὰ πόδας αὐτοῦ, καὶ πορεύσεται ; δώσει ἐναντίον ἐθνῶν, καὶ
βασιλεῖς ἐκστήσει· καὶ δώσει εἰς γῆν τὰς μαχαίρας αὐτῶν, καὶ ὡς
φρύγανα ἐξωσμένα τὰ τόξα αὐτῶν. Καὶ διώξεται αὐτοὺς, καὶ διε- 3
λεύσεται ἐν εἰρήνῃ ἡ ὁδὸς τῶν ποδῶν αὐτοῦ· οὐκ ἥξει. Τίς ἐνήρ- 4
γησε, καὶ ἐποίησε ταῦτα; ἐκάλεσεν αὐτὴν ὁ καλῶν αὐτὴν ἀπὸ
γενεῶν ἀρχῆς· ἐγὼ Θεὸς πρῶτος, καὶ εἰς τὰ ἐπερχόμενα ἐγὼ
εἰμι. ἔδωσαν ἔθνη καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν, τὰ ἄκρα τῆς γῆς ἐξέστη- 5
σαν· ἤγγισαν, καὶ ἦλθοσαν ἅμα, κρίνων ἕκαστος τῷ πλη- 6
σίον, καὶ τῷ ἀδελφῷ βοηθῆσαι, καὶ ἐρεῖ· ἴσχυσεν ἀνὴρ τέκτων, 7
καὶ χαλκεὺς τύπτων σφύρῃ, ἅμα ἐλαύνων· τότε μὲν ἐρεῖ, σύμ-
βλημα καλὸν ἐστιν, ἰσχύρωσαν αὐτὰ ἐν ἥλοις, θήσουσιν αὐτὰ,

#### Chapter 40

**22** [He] hath established the heaven as a vault, and stretched it out as a tent to dwell in;
**23** [He is] the Giver of rulers to rule for naught, and He hath made the earth as nothing.
**24** For they shall not sow, neither shall they plant, neither shall their root strike deep into the earth; He hath breathed upon them, and they are withered, and a tempest shall take them away as stubble.
**25** Now then, to whom have ye likened Me, and [with whom] shall I be exalted? saith the Holy One.
**26** Lift up your eyes on high, and see: Who hath shown all these things? He that bringeth forth His host by number, He shall call all by name, from the greatness of His glory, and in the might of His strength, nothing hath taken thee.
**27** For say not, O Jacob, and what hast thou spoken, O Israel: "My way is hidden from God, and my God hath taken away my judgment, and hath departed."
**28** Knowest thou not now? Hast thou not heard? The eternal God, even the God who fashioned the ends of the earth, neither shall He hunger, nor shall He toil,
**29** neither is there any searching out of His understanding; giving strength unto the hungry, and sorrow unto those who suffer not.
**30** For the younger shall hunger, and the young men shall toil, and the chosen ones shall be without strength.
**31** But they that wait upon God shall renew their strength; they shall grow wings as eagles; they shall run, and not toil; they shall walk, and not hunger.

#### Chapter 41

**1** Be renewed unto Me, O Isles; for the princes shall change their strength. Let them draw near and let them speak together; then let them declare their judgment.
**2** Who hath raised up righteousness from the East, and called her to His feet, and she shall go forth? He shall give nations before Him, and shall cast down kings; and He shall give their swords unto the earth, and their bows as scattered stubble.
**3** And He shall pursue them, and the way of His feet shall pass through in peace; neither shall He fail.
**4** Who hath wrought and done these things? He that calleth her from the generations of old, He hath called her: I am God, the first, and unto the things to come, I am He.
**5** Nations did give heed and were afraid, the ends of the earth were astonished; they drew near, and came together,
**6** each one discerning with his neighbor, and to help his brother, and he shall say,
**7** "The craftsman hath been strengthened, and the smith that beateth with the hammer, driving it together: then shall he say, 'It is a good joint,' they have made them strong with nails; they shall set them, and they shall not be moved."
