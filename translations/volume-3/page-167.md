ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτοῦ ἐν κεφαλῇ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὁ ἄφρων ἐν σκότει πορεύε-
ται. Καὶ ἔγνων καί γε ἐγώ, ὅτι συνάντημα ἐν συναντήσεται τοῖς
πᾶσιν αὐτοῖς· **15** καὶ εἶπα ἐγὼ ἐν καρδίᾳ μου· ὡς συνάντημα τοῦ
ἄφρονος, καί γε ἐμοὶ συναντήσεται· καὶ ἵνατί ἐσοφισάμην;
ἐγὼ τότε περισσὸν ἐλάλησα ἐν καρδίᾳ μου, (διότι ἄφρων ἐκ περισ-
σεύματος λαλεῖ) ὅτι καί γε τοῦτο ματαιότης. **16** Ὅτι οὐκ ἔστι μνή-
μη τοῦ σοφοῦ μετὰ τοῦ ἄφρονος εἰς αἰῶνα, καθότι ἤδη ταῖς ἡμέ-
ραις ταῖς ἐπερχομέναις τὰ πάντα ἐπελήσθη· καὶ πῶς ἀποθανεῖται
ὁ σοφὸς μετὰ τοῦ ἄφρονος; **17** Καὶ ἐμίσησα σὺν τὴν ζωὴν· ὅτι πο-
νηρὸν ἐπ᾽ ἐμὲ τὸ ποίημα τὸ πεποιημένον ὑπὸ τὸν ἥλιον· ὅτι τὰ
πάντα ματαιότης καὶ προαίρεσις πνεύματος. **18** Καὶ ἐμίσησα ἐγὼ
σὺν πάντα μόχθον μου, ὃν ἐγὼ μοχθῶ ὑπὸ τὸν ἥλιον, ὅτι ἀφίω αὐ-
τὸν τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ τῷ γενησομένῳ μετ᾽ ἐμέ· (καὶ τίς οἶδεν ἢ σοφὸς
ἔσται ἢ ἄφρων;) **19** Καὶ (εἰ) ἐξουσιάσεται ἐν παντὶ μόχθῳ μου, ᾧ
ἐμόχθησα καὶ ᾧ ἐσοφισάμην ὑπὸ τὸν ἥλιον· καί γε τοῦτο ματαιό-
της. **20** Καὶ ἐπέστρεψα ἐγὼ τοῦ ἀποτάξασθαι τῇ καρδίᾳ (μου) ἐπὶ
παντὶ τῷ μόχθῳ ᾧ ἐμόχθησα ὑπὸ τὸν ἥλιον· **21** ὅτι ἐστὶν ἄνθρωπος
οὗ μόχος αὐτοῦ ἐν σοφίᾳ καὶ ἐν γνώσει καὶ ἐν ἀνδρείᾳ· καὶ ἄν-
θρωπος ὃς οὐκ ἐμόχθησεν ἐν αὐτῷ, δώσει αὐτῷ μερίδα αὐτοῦ· καί
γε τοῦτο ματαιότης καὶ πονηρία μεγάλη. **22** Ὅτι τί γίνεται τῷ ἀν-
θρώπῳ ἐν παντὶ μόχθῳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐν προαιρέσει καρδίας αὐτοῦ,
ᾧ αὐτὸς μοχθεῖ ὑπὸ τὸν ἥλιον; **23** Ὅτι πᾶσαι αἱ ἡμέραι αὐτοῦ ἀλ-
γημάτων καὶ θυμοῦ περισπασμὸς αὐτοῦ, καί γε ἐν νυκτὶ οὐ κοιμᾶ-
ται ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ· καί γε τοῦτο ματαιότης ἐστίν. **24** Οὐκ ἔστιν ἀγα-
θὸν ἀνθρώπῳ, ὃ φάγεται καὶ πίεται, καὶ ὃ δείξει τῇ ψυχῇ αὐτοῦ
ἀγαθὸν ἐν μόχθῳ αὐτοῦ· Καί γε τοῦτο ἴδον ἐγὼ ὅτι ἀπὸ χειρὸς
τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐστιν. **25** Ὅτι τίς φάγεται καὶ τίς φείσεται παρεξ αὐτοῦ;
**26** Ὅτι τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ τῷ ἀγαθῷ πρὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ ἔδωκε σοφίαν
καὶ γνῶσιν καὶ εὐφροσύνην, καὶ τῷ ἁμαρτάνοντι ἔδωκε περισπα-
σμὸν τοῦ προσθεῖναι καὶ τοῦ συναγαγεῖν, τοῦ δοῦναι τῷ ἀγαθῷ
πρὸ προσώπου τοῦ Θεοῦ· ὅτι καί γε τοῦτο ματαιότης καὶ προαίρε-
σις πνεύματος.

**CHAPTER 2**

**14** The wise man's eyes are in his head,
    but the fool walketh in darkness.
    And I also knew that one event shall befall them all;
**15** then said I in my heart, "As it happeneth to the fool,
    so also shall it happen to me;
    and to what end was I then more wise?"
    Then I spoke much in my heart,
    (for a fool speaketh out of the abundance [of his heart]),
    that this also is vanity.
**16** For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool forever;
    seeing that in the days that come, all things shall be forgotten;
    and how dieth the wise man as the fool?
**17** And I also hated life;
    because the work that is wrought under the sun was grievous unto me;
    for all is vanity and a striving after wind.
**18** And I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun:
    because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me;
    (and who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool?)
**19** And whether he shall have authority over all my labour,
    wherein I have laboured and wherein I have shown myself wise under the sun;
    this also is vanity.
**20** And I turned myself to cause my heart to renounce all the labour
    wherewith I had laboured under the sun.
**21** For there is a man whose toil is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in skill;
    and a man who hath not laboured therein,
    to him shall he give his portion:
    and this also is vanity and a great evil.
**22** For what cometh to a man of all his labour,
    and of the striving of his heart,
    wherein he laboureth under the sun?
**23** For all his days are sorrows, and his vexation [is] with wrath;
    and even in the night his heart taketh no rest:
    this also is vanity.
**24** There is nothing good for a man, [but] that he should eat and drink,
    and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour.
    This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God.
**25** For who shall eat, and who shall have joy, apart from Him?
**26** For to the man that is good before His face,
    He hath given wisdom and knowledge and joy;
    but to the sinner He hath given vexation,
    to add and to gather, to give to the good man before the face of God;
    for this also is vanity and a striving after wind.

**CHAPTER 3**

**1** For all things there is a time,
    and a season for every purpose under the heaven.
