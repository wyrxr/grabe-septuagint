ΚΕΦ. Κϛ΄. XXVI.
(Hebr. Cap. XLVI.)

1 Ο Λόγος ὁ γενόμενος παρὰ Κυρίου πρὸς Ἱερεμίαν τὸν προφήτην ἐπὶ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη· (ἐν ἀρχῇ βασιλεύοντος Σεδεκίου ἐγένετο ὁ λόγος οὗτος ἐπὶ Αἰλάμ·)
2 ΤΗ ΑΙΓΥΠΤΩ ΕΠΙ ΔΥΝΑΜΙΝ ΦΑΡΑΩ ΝΕΧΑΩ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ ΑΙΓΥΠΤΟΥ, ὃς ἦν ἐπὶ τοῦ ποταμοῦ Εὐφράτου ἐν Χαρμεῖς, ὃν ἐπάταξε Ναβουχοδονόσορ βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος, ἐν τῷ ἔτει τῷ τετάρτῳ Ἰωακεὶμ υἱοῦ Ἰωσίου βασιλέως Ἰούδα.
3 Ἀναλάβετε ὅπλα καὶ ἀσπίδας, καὶ προσαγάγετε εἰς πόλεμον,
4 ἐπισάξατε τοὺς ἵππους, ἐπίβητε οἱ ἱππεῖς, καὶ κατάστητε ἐν ταῖς περικεφαλαίαις ὑμῶν, προσβάλετε τὰ δόρατα ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐνδύσασθε τοὺς θώρακας ὑμῶν.
5 Τί ὅτι αὐτοὶ πτοοῦνται, καὶ ἀποχωροῦσιν εἰς τὸ ὀπίσω; διότι οἱ ἰσχυροὶ αὐτῶν κοπήσονται, φυγῇ ἔφυγον, καὶ οὐκ ἀνέστρεψαν περιερχόμενοι κυκλόθεν, λέγει Κύριος.
6 Μὴ φευγέτω ὁ κοῦφος, καὶ μὴ ἀνασωζέσθω ὁ ἰσχυρὸς ἐπὶ βορρᾶν· τὰ παρὰ τὸν Εὐφράτην ἠσθένησαν, καὶ πεπτώκασι.
7 Τίς οὗτος ὡς ποταμὸς ἀναβήσεται, καὶ ὡς ποταμοὶ κυμανοῦσιν ὕδωρ;
8 Ὕδατα Αἰγύπτου ὡς ποταμὸς ἀναβήσεται, καὶ ὡς ποταμῶν ἐκταράσσεται τὰ ὕδατα αὐτῆς. Καὶ εἶπεν· ἀναβήσομαι, καὶ κατακαλύψω τὴν γῆν καὶ ἀπολῶ τὴν πόλιν καὶ κατοικοῦντας ἐν αὐτῇ.
9 Ἐπίβητε ἐπὶ τοὺς ἵππους, καὶ κατασκευάσασθε τὰ ἅρματα, ἐξέλθατε οἱ μαχηταὶ Αἰθιόπων, καὶ Λίβυες καθωπλισμένοι ὅπλοις καὶ Λυδοὶ ἀνάβητε, ἐντείνατε τόξον,
10 καὶ ἡ ἡμέρα ἐκείνη Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ ἡμῶν ἡμέρα ἐκδικήσεως, τοῦ ἐκδικῆσαι τοὺς ἐχθροὺς αὐτοῦ· καὶ καταφάγεται ἡ μάχαιρα Κυρίου, καὶ ἐμπλησθήσεται, καὶ μεθυσθήσεται ἀπὸ τοῦ αἵματος αὐτῶν, ὅτι θυσία τῷ Κυρίῳ Σαβαὼθ ἀπὸ γῆς βορρᾶ ἐπὶ ποταμῷ Εὐφράτη.
11 Ἀνάβηθι Γαλαάδ, καὶ λάβε ῥητίνην τῇ παρθένῳ θυγατρὶ Αἰγύπτου· εἰς κενὸν ἐπλήθυνας ἰάματά σου, ὠφέλεια οὐκ ἔστι σοι.
12 Ἤκουσαν ἔθνη φωνήν σου, καὶ τῆς κραυγῆς σου ἐπλήσθη ἡ γῆ, ὅτι μαχητὴς πρὸς μαχητὴν ἠσθένησαν, ἐπιτοχυτὸ ἔπεσαν ἀμφότεροι.
13 Ἃ ΕΛΑΛΗΣΕ ΚΥΡΙΟΣ ἐν χειρὶ Ἱερεμίου τοῦ προφήτου περὶ τοῦ ἐλθεῖν Ναβουχοδονόσορ τὸν βασιλέα Βαβυλῶνος τοῦ ἐκκόψαι τὴν γῆν Αἰγύπτου.
14 Ἀναγγείλατε ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ, καὶ ἀκουστὸν ποιήσατε εἰς Μαγδωλόν, καὶ παραγγείλατε εἰς Μέμφιν, καὶ ἐν Τάφνας· εἴπατε, ἐπίστηθι, καὶ ἑτοίμασον σεαυτήν, ὅτι κατέφαγε μάχαιρα τὴν σμίλακά σου.

**Jeremiah 26**
(Hebrew Chapter 46)

**1** The word which came unto Jeremiah the prophet from the Lord against all nations. (In the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah, this word came concerning Elam.)
**2** Unto Egypt, concerning the host of Pharaoh Necho, king of Egypt, who was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, whom Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, did smite in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, the king of Judah.
**3** Take up [your] shields and bucklers, and draw near unto the battle.
**4** Harness ye the horses; and mount, ye horsemen; and stand forth in your helmets; polish your spears, and array yourselves in your breastplates.
**5** Wherefore are they dismayed, and turn back? For their mighty ones shall be cut down; they have fled with haste, and have not returned, ranging round about, saith the Lord.
**6** Let not the swift flee, nor the mighty escape toward the north. [For] those by the river Euphrates have been made weak, and have fallen.
**7** Who is this that riseth up like the Nile, and whose waters surge like the rivers?
**8** The waters of Egypt shall rise like the Nile, and like [the surging] of rivers shall her waters be troubled. And he said: “I will ascend, and I will cover the land; and I will destroy the city and them that dwell therein.”
**9** Mount ye the horses, and prepare the chariots. Go forth, ye warriors of Ethiopia, and ye Libyans armed with weapons, and ye Lydians, mount ye [to battle], bend the bow;
**10** for that day is a day of vengeance unto the Lord our God, to take vengeance upon His enemies. And the sword of the Lord shall devour, and it shall be satisfied, and made drunken with their blood; for it is a sacrifice unto the Lord of Hosts from the land of the north, by the river Euphrates.
**11** Go up to Gilead, and take balm for the virgin daughter of Egypt. In vain hast thou multiplied thy remedies; no profit is there for thee.
**12** The nations have heard thy voice, and the earth is filled with thy cry; for warrior against warrior have they been made weak, and with swiftness did they both fall.
**13** The word which the Lord spake by the hand of Jeremiah the prophet concerning Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, that he should come to smite the land of Egypt.
**14** Declare ye in Egypt, and make [it] heard in Migdol; proclaim [it] in Memphis, and in Tahpanhes. Say ye, “Stand forth, and prepare thyself, for the sword hath devoured thy root.”
