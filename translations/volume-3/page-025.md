καὶ τὸ κρίμά σου ὡς μεσημβρίαν.
9 Ὑποτάγηθι τῷ Κυρίῳ, καὶ ἱκέτευσον αὐτόν· μὴ παραζήλου ἐν τῷ κατευοδουμένῳ ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ αὐτοῦ, ἐν ἀνθρώπῳ ποιοῦντι παρανομίας.
10 Παῦσαι ἀπὸ ὀργῆς, καὶ ἐγκατάλιπε θυμόν· μὴ παραζήλου, ὥστε πονηρεύεσθαι.
11 Ὅτι οἱ πονηρευόμενοι ἐξολεθρευθήσονται· οἱ δὲ ὑπομένοντες τὸν Κύριον, αὐτοὶ κληρονομήσουσι γῆν.
12 Καὶ ἔτι ὀλίγον, καὶ οὐ μὴ ὑπάρξει ὁ ἁμαρτωλός, καὶ ζητήσεις τὸν τόπον αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐ μὴ εὕρῃς·
13 οἱ δὲ πραεῖς κληρονομήσουσι γῆν, καὶ κατατρυφήσουσιν ἐπὶ πλήθει εἰρήνης (ἐπ᾽ αὐτῆς).
14 Παρατηρήσεται δὲ ὁ ἁμαρτωλὸς τὸν δίκαιον, καὶ βρύξει ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸν τοὺς ὀδόντας αὑτοῦ·
15 ὁ δὲ Κύριος ἐγγελάσεται αὐτὸν, ὅτι προβλέπει ὅτι ἥξει ἡ ἡμέρα αὐτοῦ.
16 Ῥομφαίαν ἐσπάσαντο οἱ ἁμαρτωλοί, ἐνέτειναν τόξον αὑτῶν τοῦ καταβαλεῖν πτωχὸν καὶ πένητα, τοῦ σφάξαι τοὺς εὐθεῖς τῇ καρδίᾳ·
17 ἡ ῥομφαία αὐτῶν εἰσέλθοι εἰς τὴν καρδίαν αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰ τόξα αὐτῶν συντριβείη.
18 Κρεῖσσον ὀλίγον τῷ δικαίῳ ὑπὲρ πλοῦτον ἁμαρτωλῶν πολύν.
19 Ὅτι βραχίονες ἁμαρτωλῶν συντριβήσονται· ὑποστηρίζει δὲ τοὺς δικαίους ὁ Κύριος.
20 Γινώσκει Κύριος τὰς ὁδοὺς τῶν ἀμώμων, καὶ ἡ κληρονομία αὐτῶν εἰς αἰῶνα ἔσται·
21 οὐ καταισχυνθήσονται ἐν καιρῷ πονηρῷ, καὶ ἐν ἡμέραις λιμοῦ χορτασθήσονται.
22 Ὅτι οἱ ἁμαρτωλοὶ ἀπολοῦνται· οἱ δὲ ἐχθροὶ τοῦ Κυρίου ἅμα τῷ δοξασθῆναι αὐτοὺς καὶ ὑψωθῆναι, ἐκλείποντες ὡσεὶ καπνὸς ἐξέλιπον.
23 Δανείζεται δὲ ὁ ἁμαρτωλός, καὶ οὐκ ἀποτίσει· ὁ δὲ δίκαιος οἰκτείρει, καὶ δίδωσιν.
24 Ὅτι οἱ εὐλογοῦντες αὐτὸν κληρονομήσουσι γῆν· οἱ δὲ καταρώμενοι αὐτὸν ἐξολεθρευθήσονται.
25 Παρὰ Κυρίου τὰ διαβήματα ἀνθρώπου κατευθύνεται, καὶ τὴν ὁδὸν αὐτοῦ θελήσει (σφόδρα)·
26 ὅταν πέσῃ οὐ καταραχθήσεται, ὅτι Κύριος ἀντιστηρίζει χεῖρα αὐτοῦ.
27 Νεώτερος ἐγενόμην, καὶ γὰρ ἐγήρασα, καὶ οὐκ εἶδον δίκαιον ἐγκαταλελειμμένον, οὐδὲ τὸ σπέρμα αὐτοῦ ζητοῦν ἄρτους·
28 ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν ἐλεεῖ καὶ δανείζει (ὁ δίκαιος), καὶ τὸ σπέρμα αὐτοῦ εἰς εὐλογίαν ἔσται.
29 Ἔκκλινον ἀπὸ κακοῦ, καὶ ποίησον ἀγαθὸν, καὶ κατασκήνου εἰς αἰῶνα αἰῶνος.
30 Ὅτι Κύριος ἀγαπᾷ κρίσιν, καὶ οὐκ ἐγκαταλείψει τοὺς ὁσίους αὑτοῦ, εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα φυλαχθήσονται· ἄνομοι δὲ ἐκδικηθήσονται, καὶ σπέρμα ἀσεβῶν ἐξολεθρευθήσεται.
31 Δίκαιοι δὲ κληρονομήσουσι γῆν, καὶ κατασκηνώσουσιν εἰς αἰῶνα αἰῶνος ἐπ᾽ αὐτῆς.
32 Στόμα δικαίου μελετήσει σοφίαν, καὶ ἡ γλῶσσα αὐτοῦ λαλήσει κρίσιν·
33 ὁ νόμος τοῦ Θεοῦ αὐτοῦ ἐν καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐχ ὑποσκελισθήσεται τὰ διαβήματα αὐτοῦ.

**PSALM XXXVI.**

8 And thy judgment as the noonday.

9 Submit thyself unto the Lord, and entreat Him;
Fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way,
Nor because of the man that worketh iniquity.
10 Cease from anger, and forsake wrath;
Fret not thyself, lest thou be moved to do evil.
11 For evildoers shall be utterly destroyed;
But they that wait upon the Lord, they shall inherit the land.
12 And yet a little while, and the sinner shall be no more;
Yea, thou shalt seek his place, and thou shalt not find [it].
13 But the meek shall inherit the land,
And shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace [thereon].

14 But the sinner watcheth the righteous,
And gnasheth upon him with his teeth.
15 But the Lord shall laugh at him,
For He foreseeth that his day shall come.
16 The sinners have drawn a sword, and have bent their bow,
To cast down the poor and needy,
And to slay those who are upright in heart.
17 May their sword enter into their own heart,
And their bows be broken.

18 Better is a little to the righteous man,
Than great riches of many sinners.
19 For the arms of sinners shall be broken;
But the Lord upholdeth the righteous.
20 The Lord knoweth the ways of the blameless,
And their inheritance shall be for ever.
21 They shall not be ashamed in an evil time,
And in days of famine they shall be satisfied.
22 For the sinners shall perish;
But the enemies of the Lord, when they shall have been glorified and exalted,
Shall vanish away as smoke, yea, they shall utterly vanish.

23 But the sinner borroweth, and will not repay;
But the righteous is merciful, and giveth.
24 For they that bless him shall inherit the land;
But they that curse him shall be utterly destroyed.
25 By the Lord are the steps of a man ordered,
And his way shall He greatly desire.
26 Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down,
For the Lord upholdeth his hand.
27 I have been young, and now am old;
Yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken,
Nor his seed begging bread.
28 All the day long he [that is, the righteous] is merciful and lendeth,
And his seed shall be for a blessing.

29 Depart from evil, and do good;
And dwell for ever and ever.
30 For the Lord loveth judgment,
And will not forsake His holy ones;
They shall be preserved for evermore.
But the lawless shall be avenged,
And the seed of the ungodly shall be utterly destroyed.
31 But the righteous shall inherit the land,
And shall dwell therein for ever and ever.
32 The mouth of the righteous shall meditate wisdom,
And his tongue shall speak judgment.
33 The law of his God is in his heart;
And his steps shall not slide.
