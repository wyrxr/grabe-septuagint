λισμόν, καὶ εἰς διαμερισμὸν Ἀσσυρίων, καὶ αἱ πόλεις σου αἱ ὀχυραὶ εἰς διαμερισμὸν ἀπὸ Τύρου ἕως τοῦ ποταμοῦ Συρίας, καὶ ἀπὸ θαλάσσης ἕως θαλάσσης, καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ ὄρους ἕως τοῦ ὄρους ἡμέρας
13 ὕδατος καὶ θορύβου. καὶ ἔσται ἡ γῆ εἰς ἀφανισμὸν μετὰ τῶν κατοικούντων αὐτήν, ἀπὸ καρπῶν ἐπιτηδευμάτων αὐτῶν.
14 Ποίμαινε λαόν σου ἐν ῥάβδῳ σου, (φυλήν σου) πρόβατα κληρονομίας σου, κατασκηνοῦντας καθ᾿ ἑαυτοὺς δρυμὸν ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ Καρμήλου, νεμήσονται τὴν Βασανῖτιν, καὶ τὴν Γαλααδῖτιν καθὼς αἱ ἡμέραι τοῦ αἰῶνος.
15 Καὶ κατὰ τὰς ἡμέρας ἐξοδίας σου ἐξ Αἰγύπτου, ὄψεσθε θαυμαστά.
16 ἐξονται ἔθνη καὶ καταισχυνθήσονται ἐκ πάσης τῆς ἰσχύος αὐτῶν, ἐπιθήσουσι χεῖρα ἐπὶ στόμα αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰ ὦτα αὐτῶν
17 ἀποκωφωθήσονται, λείξουσι χοῦν ὡς ὄφεις σύροντες γῆν, συγχυθήσονται ἐν συγκλεισμῷ αὐτῶν. ἐπὶ τῷ Κυρίῳ Θεῷ ἡμῶν ἐκστήσονται, καὶ φοβηθήσονται ἀπὸ σοῦ.
18 Τίς Θεὸς ὥσπερ σύ; ἐξαίρων ἀδικίας, καὶ ὑπερβαίνων ἀσεβείας τοῖς καταλοίποις τῆς κληρονομίας αὐτοῦ· καὶ οὐ συνέσχεν εἰς μαρτύριον ὀργὴν αὐτοῦ, ὅτι θελητὴς ἐλέους ἐστίν.
19 Αὐτὸς ἐπιστρέψει, καὶ οἰκτειρήσει ἡμᾶς, καὶ καταδύσει τὰς ἀδικίας ἡμῶν καὶ ἀποῤῥίψει εἰς τὰ βάθη τῆς θαλάσσης πάσας τὰς ἁμαρτίας ἡμῶν.
20 Δώσει εἰς ἀλήθειαν τῷ Ἰακώβ, ἔλεος τῷ Ἀβραάμ, καθότι ὤμοσας τοῖς πατράσιν ἡμῶν, κατὰ τὰς ἡμέρας τὰς ἔμπροσθεν.

#### Micah
##### Chapter 7 (Cont.)
**12** ...unto leveling, and unto a devastation of the Assyrians; and thy fortified cities [shall come] unto a devastation, from Tyre even unto the river of Syria, and from sea unto sea, and from mountain unto mountain, in a day of water and of tumult.
**13** And the land shall be for desolation, with them that dwell therein, by reason of the fruit of their doings.
**14** Shepherd Thy people with Thy rod, (even Thy tribe,) the sheep of Thine inheritance, which dwell solitarily in a forest in the midst of Carmel; they shall feed in Bashan and in Gilead, as in the days of old.
**15** According to the days of thy coming forth out of the land of Egypt, ye shall see marvellous things.
**16** Nations shall come forth, and they shall be put to shame despite all their strength; they shall lay their hand upon their mouth, and their ears
**17** shall be deafened; they shall lick the dust like serpents that crawl upon the earth; they shall be confounded in their confinement. They shall be astonished before the Lord our God, and they shall fear because of Thee.
**18** Who is a God like unto Thee, that taketh away iniquities, and passeth over the impieties for the remnant of His inheritance? He hath not retained His wrath for a [lasting] testimony, for He is a lover of mercy.
**19** He shall turn again, and He shall have compassion upon us; and He shall submerge our iniquities, and He shall cast all our sins into the depths of the sea.
**20** He shall render truth unto Jacob, and mercy unto Abraham, according as Thou didst swear unto our fathers, as in the days of old.
