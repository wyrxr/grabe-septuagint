8 πάντες οἱ συνηγμένοι ἐπ᾽ αὐτὴν, καὶ οἱ θλίβοντες αὐτὴν. Καὶ
ἔσονται ὡς οἱ ἐν ὕπνῳ πεινῶντες καὶ ἔσθοντες, καὶ ἐξαναστάν-
των, μάταιον αὐτῶν τὸ ἐνύπνιον· καὶ ὃν τρόπον ἐνυπνιάζεται
ὁ διψῶν ὡς ὁ πίνων, καὶ ἐξαναστὰς ἔτι διψᾷ, ἡ δὲ ψυχὴ αὐ-
τοῦ εἰς κενὸν ἤλπισεν, οὕτως ἔσται ὁ πλοῦτος πάντων τῶν
ἐθνῶν ὅσοι ἐπεστράτευσαν ἐπὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸ ὄρος Σιών.
9 Ἐκλύθητε καὶ ἐκστῆτε, ἐξαπατηθῆτε καὶ ἀπατᾶσθε, καὶ κραι-
10 παλήσατε οὐκ ἀπὸ σίκερα, οὐδ᾽ ἀπὸ οἴνου κινούμενοι· ὅτι πε-
πότικεν ὑμᾶς Κύριος πνεύματι κατανύξεως, καὶ καμμύσει τοὺς ὀ-
φθαλμοὺς αὐτῶν, καὶ τῶν προφητῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ τῶν ἀρχόντων
11 αὐτῶν, οἱ ὁρῶντες τὰ κρυπτά. Καὶ ἔσονται ὑμῖν πάντα τὰ ῥήματα
ταῦτα, ὡς οἱ λόγοι τοῦ βιβλίου τοῦ ἐσφραγισμένου τούτου, ὃ ἐὰν
δῶσιν αὐτὸ ἀνθρώπῳ ἐπισταμένῳ γράμματα, λέγοντες, ἀνάγνωθι
δὴ ταῦτα· καὶ ἐρεῖ, οὐ δύναμαι ἀναγνῶναι, ἐσφράγισται γάρ.
12 Καὶ δοθήσεται τὸ βιβλίον τοῦτο εἰς χεῖρας ἀνθρώπου
μὴ ἐπισταμένου γράμματα, καὶ ἐρεῖ αὐτῷ, ἀνάγνωθι τοῦτο·
13 καὶ ἐρεῖ, οὐκ ἐπίσταμαι γράμματα. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος· Ἐγγίζει
μοι ὁ λαὸς οὗτος ἐν τῷ στόματι αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐν τοῖς χείλεσιν
αὐτῶν τιμῶσί με, ἡ δὲ καρδία αὐτῶν πόῤῥω ἀπέχει ἀπ᾽ ἐμοῦ·
μάτην δὲ σέβονται με, διδάσκοντες ἐντάλματα ἀνθρώπων καὶ
14 διδασκαλίας. Διὰ τοῦτο ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ προσθήσω τοῦ μεταθεῖναι τὸν
λαὸν τοῦτον, καὶ μεταθήσω αὐτοὺς, καὶ ἀπολῶ τὴν σοφίαν τῶν
σοφῶν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὴν σύνεσιν τῶν συνετῶν αὐτοῦ κρύψω.
15 Οὐαὶ οἱ βαθέως βουλὴν ποιοῦντες, καὶ οὐ διὰ Κυρίου· οὐαὶ οἱ ἐν κρυφῇ
βουλὴν ποιοῦντες, καὶ ἔσται ἐν σκότει τὰ ἔργα αὐτῶν· καὶ
ἐροῦσι, τίς ἡμᾶς ἑώρακε ; καὶ τίς ἡμᾶς γνώσεται, ἢ ἃ ἡμεῖς
16 ποιοῦμεν; Οὐχ ὡς ὁ πηλὸς τοῦ κεραμέως λογισθήσεσθε· μὴ
ἐρεῖ τὸ πλάσμα τῷ πλάσαντι αὐτὸ, οὐ σύ με ἔπλασας ; ἢ τὸ
17 ποίημα τῷ ποιήσαντι, οὐ συνετῶς με ἐποίησας; Οὐκέτι μικρὸν
βραχὺ καὶ μετατεθήσεται ὁ Λίβανος, ὡς τὸ ὄρος τὸ Χέρμελ,
18 καὶ τὸ ὄρος τὸ Χέρμελ εἰς δρυμὸν λογισθήσεται. Καὶ ἀκού-
σονται ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ κωφοὶ λόγους βιβλίου, καὶ οἱ ἐν τῷ
σκότει, καὶ οἱ ἐν τῇ ἐμίχλῃ ὀφθαλμοὶ τυφλῶν βλέψονται,
19 καὶ ἀγαλλιάσονται πτωχοὶ διὰ Κύριον ἐν εὐφροσύνῃ, καὶ οἱ ἀπηλ-
πισμένοι τῶν ἀνθρώπων καὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐμπλησθήσονται εὐφροσύνης.
20 Ἐξέλιπεν ἄνομος, καὶ ἀπώλετο ὑπερήφανος, καὶ ἐξωλεθρεύθησαν
21 πάντες οἱ ἀνομοῦντες ἐπὶ κακίᾳ, καὶ οἱ ποιοῦντες ἁμαρτεῖν ἀνθρώ-
πους ἐν λόγῳ, πάντας δὲ τοὺς ἐλέγχοντας ἐν πύλαις πρόσκομμα
θήσουσι, καὶ ἐπλαγίασαν ἐν ἀδίκοις δικαίῳ.

**Chapter 29**

**8** and all they that are gathered against her, and all they that oppress her. And they shall be as one that is hungry and dreameth, and behold, he doth eat; but when he awakeneth, his dream is vain. And as one that thirsteth dreameth, and behold, he doth drink; but when he hath awoken, he still thirsteth, and his soul is empty of hope: so shall be the wealth of all the nations, even all they that warred against Jerusalem, and against Mount Zion.

**9** Be ye faint and be ye astonished; be ye deceived and deceive yourselves; and be ye drunken, yet not with strong drink, nor moved by wine. **10** For the Lord hath made you drink with a spirit of deep slumber, and He shall close their eyes, even the eyes of their prophets, and of their rulers, they that see the hidden things.

**11** And all these words shall be unto you as the words of this sealed book, which, if men deliver it unto one that knoweth letters, saying, 'Read this, I pray thee,' he shall say, 'I cannot read it, for it is sealed.'

**12** And this book shall be delivered into the hands of a man that knoweth not letters; and [one] shall say unto him, 'Read this;' **13** and he shall say, 'I know not letters.' And the Lord said, 'This people draweth nigh unto Me with their mouth, and with their lips they honor Me, but their heart is far removed from Me. And in vain do they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the precepts of men and human teachings. **14** Therefore, behold, I will yet again deal with this people and shall change them; and I will destroy the wisdom of their wise, and the understanding of their prudent ones I will hide.'

**15** Woe unto them that make counsel deeply, and not through the Lord! Woe unto them that make counsel in secret! For their works shall be in darkness. And they shall say, 'Who hath seen us? And who shall know us, or [even] what we do? **16** Shall ye not be reckoned as the potter's clay? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, 'Thou didst not form me?' **17** Or shall the work say to him that made it, 'Thou didst not make me with understanding?' Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be transformed as Mount Carmel, **18** and Mount Carmel shall be reckoned as a forest? And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book; and the eyes of the blind, [even those] in the darkness and in the mist, shall see; **19** and the poor shall rejoice in the Lord with gladness; and they that have despaired among men, and [even] Israel, shall be filled with joy.

**20** The lawless man hath vanished, and the proud man hath perished; and they have been utterly destroyed, **21** all they that work lawlessness for wickedness; and they that make men to sin with a word; and they shall lay a stumbling-block for all them that reprove in the gates; and they have caused the righteous to stray among the unjust.
