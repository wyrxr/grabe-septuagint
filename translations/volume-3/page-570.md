Γόμοῤῥα, καὶ Δαμασκὸς ἐκλελειμμένη ὡς θιμωνία ἅλωνος, καὶ
ἠφανισμένη εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα· καὶ οἱ κατάλοιποι τοῦ λαοῦ μου διαρπῶνται αὐτούς, καὶ οἱ κατάλοιποι ἔθνους μου κληρονομήσουσιν
10 αὐτούς. Αὕτη αὐτοῖς ἀντὶ τῆς ὕβρεως αὐτῶν, διότι ὠνείδισαν,
11 καὶ ἐμεγαλύνθησαν ἐπὶ τὸν Κύριον τὸν παντοκράτορα. Ἐπιφανὴς ἔσται Κύριος ἐπ᾿ αὐτούς, καὶ ἐξολοθρεύσει πάντας τοὺς θεοὺς
τῶν ἐθνῶν τῆς γῆς· καὶ προσκυνήσουσιν αὐτῷ ἕκαστος ἐκ τοῦ
12 τόπου αὐτοῦ, πᾶσαι αἱ νῆσοι τῶν ἐθνῶν. Καὶ ὑμεῖς Αἰθίοπες
13 τραυματίαι ῥομφαίας μου ἐστέ· καὶ ἐκτενεῖ τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ
βοῤῥᾶν, καὶ ἀπολεῖ τὸν Ἀσσύριον, καὶ θήσει τὴν Νινευὴ εἰς ἀ-
14 φανισμὸν ἄνυδρον, ὡς ἔρημον· καὶ νεμήσονται ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῆς
ποίμνια, καὶ πάντα τὰ θηρία τῆς γῆς, καὶ χαμαιλέοντες καὶ
ἔγλινοι ἐν τοῖς φατνώμασιν αὐτῆς κοιτασθήσονται· καὶ θηρία φω-
νήσει ἐν τοῖς διορύγμασιν αὐτῆς, κόρακες ἐν τοῖς πυλῶσιν αὐτῆς, διότι κέδρος τὸ ἀνάστημα αὐτῆς.
15 Αὕτη ἡ πόλις ἡ φαυλίστρια, ἡ κατοικοῦσα ἐπ᾿ ἐλπίδι, ἡ λέγουσα ἐν καρδίᾳ αὐτῆς· ἐγώ εἰμι, καὶ οὐκ ἔστι μετ᾿ ἐμὲ ἔτι. Πῶς ἐγενήθη εἰς ἀφανισμὸν νομὴ θηρίων; πᾶς ὁ παραπορευόμενος δ᾿ αὐτῆς συριεῖ, καὶ κινήσει τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ.

1. 2. Ὦ ἡ ἐπιφανὴς καὶ ἀπολελυτρωμένη πόλις, ἡ περιστερὰ· οὐκ
εἰσήκουσε φωνῆς, οὐκ ἐδέξατο παιδείαν, ἐπὶ τῷ Κυρίῳ οὐκ ἐπεποίθει, καὶ πρὸς τὸν Θεὸν αὐτῆς οὐκ ἤγγισεν.
3 Οἱ ἄρχοντες αὐτῆς ἐν αὐτῇ ὡς λέοντες ὠρυόμενοι· οἱ κριταὶ αὐτῆς ὡς λύκοι τῆς Ἀραβίας, οὐχ ὑπελίποντο εἰς τὸ πρωί.
4 Οἱ προφῆται αὐτῆς πνευματοφόροι, ἄνδρες καταφρονηταί· οἱ ἱερεῖς αὐτῆς βεβηλοῦσι τὰ ἅγια, καὶ ἀσεβοῦσι νόμον.
5 Ὁ δὲ Κύριος δίκαιος ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῆς, καὶ οὐ μὴ ποιήσῃ ἄδικον· πρωΐ πρωΐ δώσει τὸ κρῖμα αὐτοῦ εἰς φῶς, καὶ οὐκ εἰς νεῖκος ἀδικίαν.
6 Ἐν διαφθορᾷ κατέσπασα ὑπερηφάνους, ἠφανίσθησαν γωνίαι αὐτῶν· ἐξερημώσω τὰς ὁδοὺς αὐτῶν τὸ παράπαν, τοῦ μὴ διοδεύειν· ἐξέλιπον αἱ πόλεις αὐτῶν διὰ τὸ μηδένα ὑπάρχειν, μηδὲ κατοικεῖν.
7 Εἶπα, πλὴν φοβεῖσθέ με, καὶ δέξασθε παιδείαν, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἐξολοθρευθῆτε ἐξ ὀφθαλμῶν αὐτῆς, πάντα ὅσα ἐδίκησα ἐπ᾿ αὐτήν· ἑτοιμάζου, ὄρθρισον, διέφθαρται πᾶσα ἡ ἐπιφυλλὶς αὐτῶν.
8 Διὰ τοῦτο ὑπόμεινόν με, λέγει Κύριος,

Gomorrah; and Damascus shall be left as a heap of the threshing floor, and utterly destroyed for ever. And the remnant of My people shall despoil them, and the remnant of My nation shall inherit them.
**10** This shall be unto them for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the Lord Almighty.
**11** The Lord shall be made manifest against them, and He shall utterly destroy all the gods of the nations of the earth; and every man from his own place shall worship Him, even all the coastlands of the nations.
**12** And ye also, O Ethiopians, are the wounded of My sword.
**13** And He shall stretch forth His hand upon the North, and shall destroy Assyria, and shall make Nineveh a desolate, waterless ruin, as a wilderness.
**14** And flocks shall graze in the midst thereof, and all the beasts of the earth; and chameleons and dormice shall lodge in her ceiling panels. And wild beasts shall cry in her ruins, and ravens in her gates, because her stature was as the cedar.
**15** This is the defiling city, that dwelleth securely, that saith in her heart, "I am, and there is none beside me." How is she become a desolation, a pasture for beasts? Every one that passeth by her shall hiss [in derision], and shall clap his hands.

**CHAPTER 3.**

**1-2** O the renowned and redeemed city, the dove! She hearkened not unto the voice, she received not instruction; she trusted not in the Lord, and she drew not near to her God.
**3** Her princes within her are as roaring lions; her judges are as wolves of Arabia, they leave naught for the morrow.
**4** Her prophets are men possessed of [empty] spirit, scornful men; her priests profane the holy things, and commit impiety against the law.
**5** But the Lord is righteous in the midst of her, and will do no injustice; morning by morning will He bring His judgment to light, and will not contend with injustice.
**6** In corruption have I pulled down the proud; their strongholds are destroyed. I will make their ways utterly desolate, so that none shall pass through. Their cities are laid waste, for there is none to remain, nor any to dwell [therein].
**7** I said, "Surely ye will fear Me, and receive instruction; and ye shall not be utterly destroyed from her eyes, concerning all that I have judged against her." Prepare yourselves, rise early! All their offspring is corrupted.
**8** Therefore wait thou for Me, saith the Lord,
