ΜΙΧΑΙΑΣ. ΚΕΦ. Ε΄. ς΄.
¹² τὰ ὀχυρώματά σου, καὶ ἐξαρῶ πάντα τὰ φάρμακά σου ἐκ τῶν
¹³ χειρῶν σου, καὶ ἀποφθεγγόμενοι οὐκ ἔσονται ἐν σοί. Καὶ ἐξολε-
¹⁴ θρεύσω τὰ γλυπτά σου, καὶ τὰς στήλας σου ἐκ μέσου σου, καὶ
¹⁵ κόψω τὰ ἄλση σου ἐκ μέσου σου, καὶ ἀφανιῶ τὰς πόλεις σου, καὶ
    ποιήσω ἐν θυμῷ καὶ ἐν ὀργῇ ἐκδίκησιν ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν, ἀνθ᾿ ὧν
    οὐκ εἰσήκουσάν μου.

ΚΕΦ. ς΄. VI.

¹ ἈΚΟΥΣΑΤΕ δὴ λόγον Κυρίου ἃ ὁ Κύριος εἶπεν· ἀνάστηθι
    καὶ κρίθητι πρὸς τὰ ὄρη, καὶ ἀκουσάτωσαν οἱ βουνοὶ φωνήν σου.
² Ἀκούσατε ὄρη τὴν κρίσιν τοῦ Κυρίου, καὶ αἱ φάραγγες θεμέλια
    τῆς γῆς, ὅτι κρίσις τῷ Κυρίῳ πρὸς τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ μετὰ
³ τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ διελεγχθήσεται. Λαός μου, τί ἐποίησά σοι, ἢ τί ἐ-
⁴ λύπησά σε, ἢ τί παρηνώχλησά σοι; ἀποκρίθητί μοι. Διότι ἀνή-
    γαγόν σε ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, καὶ ἐξ οἴκου δουλείας ἐλυτρωσάμην
    σε, καὶ ἐξαπέστειλα πρὸ προσώπου σου τὸν Μωσῆν, καὶ Ἀαρὼν
⁵ καὶ Μαριάμ. Λαός μου μνήσθητι δὴ, τί ἐβουλεύσατο κατὰ σοῦ
    Βαλάκ βασιλεὺς Μωάβ, καὶ τί ἀπεκρίθη αὐτῷ Βαλαὰμ υἱὸς τοῦ
    Βεώρ, ἀπὸ τῶν σχοίνων ἕως τοῦ Γαλγάλ, ὅπως γνωσθῇ ἡ δι-
⁶ καιοσύνη τοῦ Κυρίου. Ἐν τίνι καταλάβω τὸν Κύριον; ἀντιλή-
    ψομαι Θεοῦ μου ὑψίστου; εἰ καταλήψομαι αὐτὸν ἐν ὁλοκαυτώμα-
⁷ σιν ἐν μόσχοις ἐνιαυσίοις; εἰ προσδέξεται ὁ Κύριος ἐν χιλιάσι
    κριῶν, ἢ ἐν μυριάσι χειμάρρων πιόνων; εἰ δῶ πρωτότοκά μου
    ὑπὲρ ἀσεβείας, καρπὸν κοιλίας μου ὑπὲρ ἁμαρτίας ψυχῆς μου;
⁸ Εἰ ἀνηγγέλη σοι, ἄνθρωπε, τί καλόν; ἢ τί Κύριος ἐκζητεῖ παρὰ
    σοῦ, ἀλλ᾿ ἢ τοῦ ποιεῖν κρῖμα καὶ ἀγαπᾷν ἔλεος, καὶ ἕτοιμον εἶ-
⁹ ναι τοῦ πορεύεσθαι μετὰ Κυρίου Θεοῦ σου; Φωνὴ Κυρίου τῇ πό-
    λει ἐπικληθήσεται, καὶ σώσει τοὺς φοβουμένους τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ·
¹⁰ ἄκουε φυλή, καὶ τίς κοσμήσει πόλιν; Μὴ πῦρ καὶ οἶκος ἀνόμου
¹¹ θησαυρίζων θησαυροὺς ἀνομίας, καὶ μετὰ ὕβρεως ἀδικία; Καὶ εἰ
    δικαιωθήσεται ἐν ζυγῷ ἄνομος, καὶ ἐν μαρσίππῳ στάθμια δόλου,
¹² ἐξ ὧν τὸν πλοῦτον αὐτῶν ἀσεβείας ἐνέπλησαν; καὶ οἱ κατοικοῦν-
    τες αὐτὴν ἐλάλουν ψεῦδη, καὶ ἡ γλῶσσα αὐτῶν ὑψώθη ἐν τῷ
¹³ στόματι αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐγὼ ἄρξομαι τοῦ πατάξαι σε, καὶ ἀφανιῶ

### Micah
#### Chapter 5
**12** thy strongholds, and I will take away all thy sorceries from thy
**13** hands, and soothsayers shall no longer be among thee.
**14** And I will utterly destroy thy graven images and thy pillars from the midst of thee,
**15** and I will cut down thy groves from the midst of thee, and I will utterly destroy thy cities; and I will execute in wrath and in fury vengeance among the nations, because they hearkened not unto Me.

#### Chapter 6
**1** Hear ye now the word of the Lord, that which the Lord hath spoken: Arise, and contend with the mountains; and let the hills hear thy voice.
**2** Hear, O ye mountains, the judgment of the Lord, and ye valleys, [even] ye foundations of the earth; for the Lord hath a controversy with His people, and He will plead His case with Israel.
**3** O My people, what have I done unto thee? or wherein have I grieved thee?
**4** or wherein have I wearied thee? Answer Me. For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of bondage; and I sent before thee Moses, and Aaron, and Miriam.
**5** O My people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted against thee, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him; from Shittim unto Gilgal, that ye may know the righteous acts of the Lord.
**6** Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, and bow myself before God Most High? Shall I come before Him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?
**7** Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of fat torrents? Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?
**8** He hath showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justice, and to love mercy, and to be ready to walk with the Lord thy God?
**9** The voice of the Lord shall call unto the city, and He shall save those who fear His Name.
**10** Hear, O tribe, and who shall govern the city? Is there not fire and the house of the lawless one,
**11** treasuring up treasures of iniquity, and with insolence, injustice? And shall the lawless one be justified with the balances, and in a bag, the weights of deceit,
**12** wherewith they have filled their wealth with ungodliness? And the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue hath been exalted in their
**13** mouth. Therefore will I begin to smite thee, and to utterly destroy
