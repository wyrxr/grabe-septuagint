**18** τὸ οὐκ ἐπιγινώσκω· ἴχνη ἀετοῦ πετομένου, καὶ ὁδοὺς ὄφεως ἐπὶ
**19** πέτρας, καὶ τρίβους νηὸς ποντοπορούσης, καὶ ὁδοὺς ἀνδρὸς ἐν νεό-
**20** τητι. Τοιαύτη ὁδὸς γυναικὸς μοιχαλίδος· ἢ ὅτ᾿ ἂν πράξῃ, ἀπο-
**20** νιψαμένη οὐδὲν φησι πεπραγέναι ἄτοπον. Διὰ τριῶν σειεῖται ἡ γῆ,
**21** τὸ δὲ τέταρτον οὐ δύναται φέρειν· ἐὰν οἰκέτης βασιλεύσῃ.
**22** καὶ ἄφρων πλησθῇ σιτίων,
**23** καὶ οἰκέτις ἐὰν ἐκβάλῃ τὴν ἑαυτῆς κυρίαν, καὶ μισητὴ γυνὴ ἐὰν τύχῃ ἀνδρὸς ἀγαθοῦ.
**24** Τέσσαρα (δὲ) ἐστιν ἐλάχιστα ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, ταῦτα δὲ ἔξι σοφώτερα τῶν σοφῶν·
**25** οἱ μύρμηκες οἷς μὴ ἔστιν ἰσχύς, καὶ ἑτοιμάζονται θέρους τὴν τροφήν·
**26** καὶ οἵ χοιρογρύλλιοι ἔθνος οὐκ ἰσχυρόν, οἷ ἐποίησαντο ἐν πέτραις τοὺς ἑαυτῶν οἴκους·
**27** ἀβασίλευτόν ἐστιν ἡ ἀκρίς, καὶ ἐκστρατεύει ἀφ᾿ ἑνὸς κελεύσματος εὐτάκτως·
**28** καὶ καλαβώτης χερσὶν ἐρειδόμενος καὶ εὐάλωτος ὤν, κατοικεῖ ἐν ὀχυρώμασι βασιλέως.
**29** Τρία δὲ ἔστιν ἃ εὐόδως πορεύονται, καὶ τὸ τέταρτον ὃ καλῶς διαβαίνει·
**30** σκύμνος λέοντος ἰσχυρότερος κτηνῶν, ὃς οὐκ ἀποστρέφεται, οὐδὲ καταπτήσσει κτῆνος·
**31** καὶ ἀλέκτωρ ἐμπεριπατῶν θηλείαις εὔψυχος, καὶ τράγος ἡγούμενος αἰπολίου, καὶ βασιλεὺς δημηγορῶν ἐν ἔθνει.
**32** Ἐὰν προῆσαι σεαυτὸν εἰς εὐφροσύνην, καὶ ἐκτείνῃς τὴν χεῖρά σου μετὰ μάχης, ἀτιμασθήσῃ.
**33** Ἄμελγε γάλα, καὶ ἔσται βούτυρον· ἐὰν δὲ ἐκπιέζῃς μυκτήρας, ἐξελεύσεται αἷμα· ἐὰν δὲ ἐξέλκῃς λόγους, ἐξελεύσονται κρίσεις καὶ μάχαι.

**The Words of Lemuel's Mother (as printed here with Chapter 24-25 transition)**

**1** Οἱ ἐμοὶ λόγοι εἴρηνται ὑπὸ Θεοῦ Βασιλέως, χρηματισμὸς ὃν ἐπαίδευσεν ἡ μήτηρ αὐτοῦ.
**2** Τί τέκνον (τηρήσεις), τί ζήσεις Θεοῦ; πρωτογενές σοι λέγω υἱέ· τί τέκνον ἐμῆς κοιλίας; τί τέκνον ἐμῶν εὐχῶν;
**3** Μὴ δῶς γυναιξὶ σὸν πλοῦτον, καὶ τὸν σὸν νοῦν καὶ βίον εἰς ὑστεροβουλίαν.
**4** Μετὰ βουλῆς πάντα ποίει· μετὰ βουλῆς οἰνοπότει.
**5** Οἱ δυνάσται θυμώδεις εἰσὶν, οἶνον μὴ πινέτωσαν.
**6** Ἵνα μὴ πιόντες ἐπιλάθωνται τῆς σοφίας, καὶ ὀρθὰ κρίνειν οὐ μὴ δύνωνται τοὺς ἀσθενεῖς. Δίδοτε μέθην τοῖς
**7** ἐν λύπαις, καὶ οἶνον πίνειν τοῖς ἐν ὀδύναις ἵνα ἐπιλάθωνται τῆς πενίας, καὶ τῶν πόνων μὴ μνησθῶσιν ἔτι:
**8** Ἄνοιγε σὸν στόμα λόγῳ Θεοῦ, καὶ κρῖνε πάντας ὑγιῶς·
**9** ἄνοιγε σὸν στόμα καὶ κρῖνε δικαίως, διάκρινε δὲ πένητα καὶ ἀσθενῆ.

**Proverbs Chapter 30 (continued)**

**18** [of which] I know not: the tracks of an eagle flying, and the ways of a serpent upon a rock;
**19** Yea, the paths of a ship sailing upon the sea, and the ways of a man in his youth.
**20** Such is the path of an adulterous woman: or when she hath acted, having washed herself, she declareth that she hath wrought no iniquity.
**21** For three things is the earth disquieted, and the fourth it cannot bear: if a servant should reign [as] king;
**22** And a foolish man be filled with meat;
**23** And a maidservant, if she cast out her own mistress; and a hated woman, if she obtain a good husband.
**24** There are four [creatures] exceeding small upon the earth, yet these six are wiser than the wise:
**25** The ants, a people of no great strength, yet they prepare their meat in the summer;
**26** And the conies, a people not strong, who have made their houses in the rocks;
**27** The locust hath no king, yet goeth she forth by one command in good order;
**28** And the lizard, that leaneth with her hands and is easily taken, dwelleth in the strongholds of a king.
**29** There are three things that walk with good success, and the fourth which passeth well:
**30** A lion's cub, stronger than [all] beasts, which turneth not back, neither feareth any beast;
**31** And a bold rooster walking among the hens, and a he-goat leading a flock of goats, and a king addressing his people in assembly.
**32** If thou hast pushed thyself forward unto joy, and hast stretched forth thy hand with strife, thou shalt be dishonored.
**33** Wring milk, and it shall be butter; but if thou press the nostrils, blood shall come forth; and if thou draw out words, judgments and contentions shall issue forth.

**The Words of Lemuel's Mother**

**1** My words have been spoken by God the King, an oracle which his mother instructed him.
**2** What, my son (shalt thou keep)? What, O son of God, shalt thou live? To thee, my firstborn, I say, my son: What, O son of my womb? What, O son of my vows?
**3** Give not thy wealth unto women, nor thy mind and thy life unto a counsel of regret.
**4** With counsel do all things; with counsel drink wine.
**5** Rulers are full of wrath; let them not drink wine;
**6** Lest, having drunk, they forget wisdom, and be not able to judge the weak rightly. Give strong drink unto them that are in sorrows,
**7** And wine to them that are in pains; that they may forget their poverty, and may no more remember their toils.
**8** Open thy mouth with the word of God, and judge all things soundly;
**9** Open thy mouth and judge justly, and decide for the poor and the weak.
