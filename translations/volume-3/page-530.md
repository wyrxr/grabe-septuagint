ΑΜΩΣ

ΚΕΦΑΛΑΙΟΝ Α΄. Ι.

**1** ΛΟΓΟΙ ᾿Αμὼς οἳ ἐγένοντο ἐν ᾿Ακκαρεὶμ ἐκ Θεκουέ, οὓς εἶδεν
ὑπὲρ ῾Ιερουσαλὴμ ἐν ἡμέραις ᾿Οζίου βασιλέως ᾿Ιούδα, καὶ ἐν
ἡμέραις ᾿Ιεροβοὰμ τοῦ ᾿Ιωὰς βασιλέως ᾿Ισραήλ, πρὸ δύο ἐτῶν
**2** τοῦ σεισμοῦ. Καὶ εἶπε˙ Κύριος ἐκ Σιὼν ἐφθέγξατο, καὶ ἐξ ῾Ιε-
ρουσαλὴμ ἔδωκε φωνὴν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπένθησαν αἱ νομαὶ τῶν ποι-
**3** μένων, καὶ ἐξηράνθη ἡ κορυφὴ τοῦ Καρμήλου. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος˙
ἐπὶ ταῖς τρισὶν ἀσεβείαις Δαμασκοῦ καὶ ἐπὶ ταῖς τέσσαρσιν οὐκ
ἀποστραφήσομαι αὐτόν, ἀνθ᾿ ὧν ἔπριζον πρίοσι σιδηροῖς τὰς ἐν
**4** γαστρὶ ἐχούσας τῶν ἐν Γαλαάδ˙ καὶ ἐξαποστελῶ πῦρ εἰς τὸν οἶ-
**5** κον ᾿Αζαήλ, καὶ καταφάγεται θεμέλια υἱοῦ ῎Αδερ˙ καὶ συντρί-
ψω μοχλοὺς Δαμασκοῦ, καὶ ἐξολεθρεύσω κατοικοῦντας ἐκ πεδίου
Ὤν, καὶ κατακόψω φυλὴν ἐξ ἀνδρῶν Χαρράν, καὶ αἰχμαλω-
**6** τισθήσεται λαὸς Συρίας ἐπίκλητος, λέγει Κύριος. Τάδε λέ-
γει Κύριος˙ ἐπὶ ταῖς τρισὶν ἀσεβείαις Γάζης καὶ ἐπὶ ταῖς τέσ-
σαρσιν οὐκ ἀποστραφήσομαι αὐτούς, ἕνεκεν τοῦ αἰχμαλωτεῦσαι
αὐτοὺς αἰχμαλωσίαν τοῦ Σαλωμών, τοῦ συγκλεῖσαι εἰς τὴν ᾿Ι-
**7** δουμαίαν˙ καὶ ἐξαποστελῶ πῦρ ἐπὶ τὰ τείχη Γάζης, καὶ κατα-
**8** φάγεται θεμέλια αὐτῆς˙ καὶ ἐξολεθρεύσω κατοικοῦντας ἐξ ᾿Αζώ-
του, καὶ ἐξαρθήσεται φυλὴ ἐξ ᾿Ασκάλωνος, καὶ ἐπάξω τὴν χεῖ-
ρά μου ἐπὶ ᾿Ακκαρών, καὶ ἀπολοῦνται οἱ κατάλοιποι τῶν ἀλλο-
**9** φύλων, λέγει Κύριος. Τάδε λέγει Κύριος˙ ἐπὶ ταῖς τρισὶν ἀ-
σεβείαις Τύρου καὶ ἐπὶ ταῖς τέσσαρσιν οὐκ ἀποστραφήσομαι αὐ-
τήν, ἀνθ᾿ ὧν συνέκλεισαν αἰχμαλωσίαν τοῦ Σαλωμὼν εἰς τὴν
**10** ᾿Ιδουμαίαν, καὶ οὐκ ἐμνήσθησαν διαθήκης ἀδελφῶν˙ καὶ ἐξαπο-
στελῶ πῦρ ἐπὶ τὰ τείχη Τύρου, καὶ καταφάγεται θεμέλια αὐτῆς.
**11** Τάδε λέγει Κύριος˙ ἐπὶ ταῖς τρισὶν ἀσεβείαις τῆς ᾿Ιδουμαίας καὶ
ἐπὶ ταῖς τέσσαρσιν οὐκ ἀποστραφήσομαι αὐτούς, ἕνεκεν τοῦ διῶ-
ξαι αὐτοὺς ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ ἕκαστος τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐλυμή-
νατο μήτραν ἐπὶ γῆς, καὶ ἥρπασεν εἰς μαρτύριον φρίκην αὐτοῦ,

**AMOS**

**CHAPTER 1**

**1** The words of Amos, which came to be in Akkareim from Tekoa, which he saw concerning Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, King of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam, the son of Joash, King of Israel, two years before the earthquake.
**2** And he said, "The Lord hath roared from Zion, and from Jerusalem hath He given forth His voice. And the pastures of the shepherds did mourn, and the top of Carmel was dried up."
**3** Thus saith the Lord: "For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not turn away from him; because they did saw with iron saws the pregnant women of Gilead.
**4** And I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, and it shall devour the foundations of the son of Ader.
**5** And I will break the bars of Damascus, and I will utterly destroy the inhabitants from the plain of On, and I will cut off the tribe from the men of Charran; and the appointed people of Syria shall be carried away captive," saith the Lord.
**6** Thus saith the Lord: "For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I will not turn away from them; because they carried away the captivity of Solomon, to deliver them up into Idumaea.
**7** And I will send a fire upon the walls of Gaza, and it shall devour her foundations.
**8** And I will utterly destroy the inhabitants from Ashdod, and a tribe shall be cut off from Ashkelon; and I will bring My hand upon Ekron, and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish," saith the Lord.
**9** Thus saith the Lord: "For three transgressions of Tyre, and for four, I will not turn away from her; because they delivered up the captivity of Solomon into Idumaea,
**10** and remembered not the covenant of brethren. And I will send a fire upon the walls of Tyre, and it shall devour her foundations."
**11** Thus saith the Lord: "For three transgressions of Idumaea, and for four, I will not turn away from them; because each did pursue his brother with the sword, and he ravaged the womb upon the earth, and he seized his horror for a testimony."
