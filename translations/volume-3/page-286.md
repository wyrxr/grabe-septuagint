**17** καὶ ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς σκοποὺς· ἀκούσατε τῆς φωνῆς τῆς σάλπιγγος,
**18** καὶ εἶπαν, οὐκ ἀκουσόμεθα. Διὰ τοῦτο ἤκουσαν τὰ ἔθνη, καὶ
**19** οἱ ποιμαίνοντες τὰ ποίμνια αὐτῶν. Ἄκουε γῆ, ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐπάγω ἐπὶ τὸν λαὸν τοῦτον κακά, τὸν καρπὸν ἀποστροφῆς αὐτῶν, ὅτι τοῖς λόγοις μου οὐ προσέσχον, καὶ τὸν νόμον μου ἀπώσαντο.
**20** Ἱνατί μοι λίβανον ἐκ Σαβὰ φέρετε, καὶ κιννάμωμον ἐκ γῆς μακρόθεν; τὰ ὁλοκαυτώματα ὑμῶν οὐκ εἰσὶ δεκτά, καὶ αἱ θυσίαι ὑμῶν οὐχ ἤδυνάν μοι.
**21** Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Κύριος· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ δίδωμι ἐπὶ τὸν λαὸν τοῦτον ἀσθένειαν, καὶ ἀσθενήσουσιν ἐν αὐτῇ πατέρες καὶ υἱοὶ ἅμα, γείτων καὶ ὁ πλησίον αὐτοῦ ἀπολοῦνται.
**22** Τάδε λέγει Κύριος· ἰδοὺ λαὸς ἔρχεται ἀπὸ βορρᾶ, καὶ ἔθνος μέγα ἐξεγερθήσεται ἀπ᾿ ἐσχάτου τῆς γῆς,
**23** τόξον καὶ ζιβύνην κρατήσουσιν· ἰταμός ἐστι, καὶ οὐκ ἐλεήσει· φωνὴ αὐτοῦ ὡς θάλασσα κυμαίνουσα, ἐφ᾿ ἵπποις καὶ ἅρμασι παρατάξεται ὡς πῦρ εἰς πόλεμον πρὸς σὲ, θύγατερ Σιών.
**24** Ἠκούσαμεν τὴν ἀκοὴν αὐτῶν, παρελύθησαν αἱ χεῖρες ἡμῶν, θλίψις κατέσχεν ἡμᾶς, ὠδῖνες ὡς τικτούσης.
**25** Μὴ ἐκπορεύεσθε εἰς ἀγρόν, καὶ ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς μὴ βαδίζετε, ὅτι ῥομφαία τῶν ἐχθρῶν παροικεῖ κυκλόθεν.
**22** Θύγατερ λαοῦ μου, περιζῶσαι σάκκον, καὶ κατάπασσε ἐν σποδῷ, πένθος ἀγαπητοῦ ποιῆσαι σεαυτῇ κοπετὸν οἰκτρόν, ὅτι ἐξαίφνης ἥξει ταλαιπωρία ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς.
**27** Δοκιμαστὴν δέδωκά σε ἐν λαοῖς δεδοκιμασμένοις, καὶ γνώσῃ με ἐν τῷ δοκιμάσαι με τὴν ὁδὸν αὐτῶν,
**28** πάντες ἀνήκοοι πορευόμενοι σκολιῶς· χαλκὸς καὶ σίδηρος, καὶ πάντες διεφθαρμένοι εἰσίν.
**29** Ἐξέλειπε φυσητὴρ ἀπὸ πυρός, ἐξέλειπε μόλιβος· εἰς κενὸν ἀργυροκόπος ἀργυροκοπεῖ, πονηρία αὐτῶν οὐκ ἐτάκη.
**30** Ἀργύριον ἀποδεδοκιμασμένον καλέσατε αὐτούς, ὅτι ἀπεδοκίμασεν αὐτοὺς Κύριος.

ΚΕΦ. Ζʹ.
**1** Ὁ Λόγος ὁ γενόμενος πρὸς Ἱερεμίαν παρὰ Κυρίου, λέγων·
**2** στῆθι ἐν πύλῃ οἴκου Κυρίου, καὶ ἀνάγνωθι ἐκεῖ τὸν λόγον τοῦτον, καὶ ἐρεῖς· ἀκούσατε λόγον Κυρίου πᾶσα ἡ Ἰουδαία, οἱ εἰσπορευόμενοι διὰ τῶν πυλῶν, προσκυνεῖν τῷ Κυρίῳ·
**3** τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ· διορθώσατε τὰς ὁδοὺς ὑμῶν, καὶ τὰ ἐπιτηδεύματα ὑμῶν, καὶ κατοικιῶ ὑμᾶς ἐν τῷ τόπῳ τούτῳ.
**4** Μὴ πεποίθατε ἐφ᾿ ἑαυτοῖς ἐπὶ λόγοις ψευδέσι, λέγοντες, Ὁ ναὸς Κυρίου, ὁ ναὸς Κυρίου, ὁ ναὸς Κυρίου ἐστὶν οὗτος.

**JEREMIAH CHAPTER 6**

**17** [I have also appointed watchmen over you, saying], "Hearken to the sound of the trumpet!"
**18** But they said, "We will not hearken." Therefore have the nations heard,
**19** and those that shepherd their flocks. Hear, O earth: behold, I bring evils upon this people, even the fruit of their turning away; because they heeded not My words, and rejected My Law.
**20** To what end bring ye frankincense unto Me from Sheba, and cinnamon from a far country? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable, neither were your sacrifices pleasing unto Me.
**21** Therefore thus saith the Lord: Behold, I give infirmity upon this people, and fathers and sons together shall be infirm in it; neighbor and his fellow shall perish.
**22** Thus saith the Lord: Behold, a people cometh from the North, and a great nation shall be stirred up from the ends of the earth.
**23** They shall grasp bow and javelin; he is ruthless, and will not have mercy. His voice is as a surging sea; upon horses and chariots shall he array himself as fire unto war against thee, O daughter of Zion.
**24** We have heard the report of them; our hands are paralyzed, tribulation hath seized us, and pangs as of a woman in travail.
**25** Go ye not forth into the field, nor walk ye in the ways; for the sword of the enemies doth dwell round about.
**26** O daughter of My people, gird thee with sackcloth, and strew thyself with ashes; make for thyself a lamentable wailing as for the mourning of a beloved, for suddenly shall tribulation come upon you.
**27** I have made thee an assayer among assayed nations, and thou shalt know Me when I assay their way.
**28** All of them are disobedient, walking perversely; [they are as] bronze and iron, and all are corrupted.
**29** The bellows have failed from the fire, the lead is spent; in vain doth the silversmith refine, for their wickedness is not melted away.
**30** Call ye them rejected silver, for the Lord hath rejected them.

**JEREMIAH CHAPTER 7**

**1** The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying:
**2** "Stand thou in the gate of the house of the Lord, and proclaim there this word, and thou shalt say: 'Hearken to the word of the Lord, all of Judea, ye that enter in by these gates, to worship the Lord!'
**3** Thus saith the Lord God of Israel: Amend your ways and your deeds, and I will cause you to dwell in this place.
**4** Trust ye not in yourselves upon false words, saying, 'The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord is this!'"
