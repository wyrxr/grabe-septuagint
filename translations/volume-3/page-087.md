ΑΛΛΗΛΟΥΪΑ. Ἐξομολογήσομαί σοι Κύριε ἐν ὅλῃ καρδίᾳ 1
μου, ἐν βουλῇ εὐθέων καὶ συναγωγῇ. Μεγάλα τὰ ἔργα Κυρίου, 2
ἐξεζητημένα εἰς πάντα τὰ θελήματα αὐτοῦ· ἐξομολόγησις καὶ με- 3
γαλοπρέπεια τὸ ἔργον αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἡ δικαιοσύνη αὐτοῦ μένει εἰς
τὸν αἰῶνα τοῦ αἰῶνος. Μνείαν ἐποιήσατο τῶν θαυμασίων αὐτοῦ· 4
ἐλεήμων καὶ οἰκτίρμων ὁ Κύριος. Τροφὴν ἔδωκε τοῖς φοβουμένοις 5
αὐτόν· μνησθήσεται εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα διαθήκης αὐτοῦ. Ἰσχὺν ἔργων 6
αὐτοῦ ἀνήγγειλε τῷ λαῷ αὐτοῦ, τοῦ δοῦναι αὐτοῖς κληρονομίαν
ἐθνῶν. Ἔργα χειρῶν αὐτοῦ ἀλήθεια καὶ κρίσις· πισταὶ πᾶσαι αἱ 7
ἐντολαὶ αὐτοῦ, ἐστηριγμέναι εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τοῦ αἰῶνος, πεποιήμε- 8
ναι ἐν ἀληθείᾳ καὶ εὐθύτητι. Λύτρωσιν ἀπέστειλε τῷ λαῷ αὐ- 9
τοῦ· ἐνετείλατο εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα διαθήκην αὐτοῦ· ἅγιον καὶ φοβερὸν
τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ. Ἀρχὴ σοφίας φόβος Κυρίου, σύνεσις (δὲ) ἀγαθὴ 10
πᾶσι τοῖς ποιοῦσιν αὐτόν· ἡ αἴνεσις αὐτοῦ μένει εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα
τοῦ αἰῶνος.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ΡΙΑ΄. CXΙ.**

ΑΛΛΗΛΟΥΪΑ. Μακάριος ἀνὴρ ὁ φοβούμενος τὸν Κύριον, ἐν 1
ταῖς ἐντολαῖς αὐτοῦ θελήσει σφόδρα· δυνατὸν ἐν τῇ γῇ ἔσται τὸ 2
σπέρμα αὐτοῦ, γενεὰ εὐθέων εὐλογηθήσεται· δόξα καὶ πλοῦτος ἐν 3
τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἡ δικαιοσύνη αὐτοῦ μένει εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τοῦ
αἰῶνος. Ἐξανέτειλεν ἐν σκότει φῶς τοῖς εὐθέσιν· ἐλεήμων καὶ 4
οἰκτίρμων καὶ δίκαιος (Κύριος ὁ Θεός). Χρηστὸς ἀνὴρ ὁ οἰκτεί- 5
ρων καὶ κιχρῶν· οἰκονομήσει τοὺς λόγους αὐτοῦ ἐν κρίσει. Ὅτι 6
εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα οὐ σαλευθήσεται· εἰς μνημόσυνον αἰώνιον ἔσται δί-
καιος. Ἀπὸ ἀκοῆς πονηρᾶς οὐ φοβηθήσεται· ἑτοίμη ἡ καρδία αὐ- 7
τοῦ ἐλπίζειν ἐπὶ Κύριον· ἐστήρικται ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ, οὐ μὴ φοβη- 8
θῇ, ἕως οὗ ἐπίδῃ ἐπὶ τοὺς ἐχθροὺς αὐτοῦ. Ἐσκόρπισεν, ἔδωκε τοῖς 9
πένησιν· ἡ δικαιοσύνη αὐτοῦ μένει εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τοῦ αἰῶνος· τὸ
κέρας αὐτοῦ ὑψωθήσεται ἐν δόξῃ. Ἁμαρτωλὸς ὄψεται καὶ ὀργι- 10
σθήσεται, τοὺς ὀδόντας αὐτοῦ βρύξει καὶ τακήσεται· ἐπιθυμία
ἁμαρτωλῶν ἀπολεῖται.

**PSALM CX.**

**ALLELUIA.**
1 I will give Thee thanks, O Lord, with my whole heart,
    in the counsel of the upright and in the congregation.
2 Great are the works of the Lord,
    sought out according to all His will.
3 Confession and majesty is His work,
    and His righteousness abideth unto the age of ages.
4 He hath made a memorial of His wondrous works;
    merciful and compassionate is the Lord.
5 He hath given food to them that fear Him;
    He will be mindful of His covenant unto the age.
6 The power of His works hath He declared unto His people,
    to give them the inheritance of the nations.
7 The works of His hands are truth and judgment;
    faithful are all His commandments,
8 established unto the age of ages,
    made in truth and uprightness.
9 Redemption hath He sent unto His people;
    He hath commanded His covenant unto the age;
    holy and fearsome is His Name.
10 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom;
    good understanding (indeed) have all they that do it;
    His praise abideth unto the age of ages.

**PSALM CXI.**

**ALLELUIA.**
1 Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord,
    in His commandments shall he delight greatly.
2 Mighty shall his seed be upon the earth;
    the generation of the upright shall be blessed.
3 Glory and riches are in his house,
    and his righteousness abideth unto the age of ages.
4 Light hath sprung forth in darkness for the upright;
    merciful and compassionate and righteous (is the Lord God).
5 Good is the man that is merciful and lendeth;
    he shall order his words with judgment.
6 For he shall not be shaken for ever;
    the righteous man shall be in everlasting remembrance.
7 He shall not fear from evil report;
    his heart is ready to hope in the Lord.
8 His heart is established, he shall not be afraid,
    until he look upon his enemies.
9 He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor;
    his righteousness abideth unto the age of ages;
    his horn shall be exalted in glory.
10 The sinner shall see and be angered;
    he shall gnash his teeth and waste away;
    the desire of sinners shall perish.
