αὐτοῦ; συνετέλεσε ζῆμα ἀπὸ γενεᾶς εἰς γενεάν; Ἡ ἐπιλήσεται
τοῦ οἰκτειρῆσαι ὁ Θεός; ἢ συνέξει ἐν τῇ ὀργῇ αὐτοῦ τοὺς οἰκτιρ-
μοὺς αὐτοῦ; Διάψαλμα. Καὶ εἶπα, νῦν ἠρξάμην· αὕτη ἡ ἀλλοίω-
σις τῆς δεξιᾶς τοῦ ὑψίστου. Ἐμνήσθην τῶν ἔργων Κυρίου· ὅτι
μνησθήσομαι ἀπὸ τῆς ἀρχῆς τῶν θαυμασίων σου, καὶ μελετήσω
ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς ἔργοις σου, καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἐπιτηδεύμασί σου ἀδολεχγή-
σω. Ὁ Θεὸς ἐν τῷ ἁγίῳ ἡ ὁδός σου· τίς Θεὸς μέγας ὡς ὁ Θεὸς
ἡμῶν; Σὺ εἶ ὁ Θεὸς ὁ ποιῶν θαυμάσια· ἐγνώρισας ἐν τοῖς λαοῖς
τὴν δύναμίν σου. Ἐλυτρώσω ἐν τῷ βραχίονί σου τὸν λαόν σου,
τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰακὼβ καὶ Ἰωσήφ. Διάψαλμα. Εἶδοσάν σε ὕδατα, ὁ
Θεός, εἶδοσάν σε ὕδατα, καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν· καὶ ἐταράχθησαν ἄβυσ-
σοι, πλῆθος ἤχους ὑδάτων φωνὴν ἔδωκαν αἱ νεφέλαι, καὶ γὰρ τὰ
βέλη σου διαπορεύονται. Φωνὴ τῆς βροντῆς σου ἐν τῷ τροχῷ,
ἔφαναν αἱ ἀστραπαί σου τῇ οἰκουμένῃ· ἐσαλεύθη καὶ ἔντρομος ἐγε-
νήθη ἡ γῆ. Ἐν τῇ θαλάσσῃ ἡ ὁδός σου, καὶ αἱ τρίβοι σου ἐν ὕδα-
σι πολλοῖς, καὶ τὰ ἴχνη σου οὐ γνωσθήσονται. Ὁδήγησας ὡς πρό-
βατα τὸν λαόν σου ἐν χειρὶ Μωσῆ καὶ Ἀαρών.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ΟΖ´. LXXVII.**
ΣΥΝΕΣΕΩΣ τῷ Ἀσάφ. Προσέχετε λαός μου τὸν νόμον
μου, κλίνατε τὸ οὖς ὑμῶν εἰς τὰ ῥήματα τοῦ στόματός μου· ἀνοί-
ξω ἐν παραβολαῖς τὸ στόμα μου, φθέγξομαι προβλήματα ἀπ᾿ ἀρ-
χῆς· ὅσα ἠκούσαμεν καὶ ἔγνωμεν αὐτά, καὶ οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν διη-
γήσαντο ἡμῖν· οὐκ ἐκρύβη ἀπὸ τῶν τέκνων αὐτῶν εἰς γενεὰν ἑτέ-
ραν, ἀπαγγέλλοντες τὰς αἰνέσεις Κυρίου, καὶ τὰς δυναστείας αὐ-
τοῦ, καὶ τὰ θαυμάσια αὐτοῦ ἃ ἐποίησε. Καὶ ἀνέστησε μαρτύριον
ἐν Ἰακώβ, καὶ νόμον ἔθετο ἐν Ἰσραήλ· ὅσα ἐνετείλατο τοῖς πα-
τράσιν ἡμῶν, τοῦ γνωρίσαι αὐτὰ τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτῶν· ὅπως ἂν γνῶ
γενεὰ ἑτέρα, υἱοὶ οἱ τεχθησόμενοι, καὶ ἀναστήσονται καὶ ἀπαγγε-
λοῦσιν (αὐτά) τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτῶν· ἵνα θῶνται ἐπὶ τὸν Θεὸν τὴν ἐλπί-
δα αὐτῶν, καὶ μὴ ἐπιλάθωνται τῶν ἔργων τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ τὰς ἐν-
τολὰς αὐτοῦ ἐζητήσωσιν· ἵνα μὴ γένωνται ὡς οἱ πατέρες αὐτῶν,
γενεὰ σκολιὰ καὶ παραπικραίνουσα, γενεὰ ἥτις οὐ κατεύθυνε τὴν
καρδίαν αὐτῆς· καὶ οὐκ ἐπιστώθη μετὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ τὸ πνεῦμα αὐ-
τῆς. Υἱοὶ Ἐφραὶμ ἐντείνοντες καὶ βάλλοντες τόξον, ἐστράφησαν

**PSALM LXXVI.**

12 ...or hath He made an end of [His] ferment from generation to generation?
13 Hath God forgotten to have mercy?
Or will He, in His wrath, restrain His compassions? Selah.
14 And I said, "Now have I begun;
This is the transforming work of the right hand of the Most High."
15 I remembered the works of the Lord;
For I will remember from the beginning Thy wondrous deeds,
16 And I will meditate on all Thy works,
And in Thy pursuits I will deeply ponder.
17 O God, Thy way is in the sanctuary;
What God is great as our God?
18 Thou art the God that doest wondrous deeds;
Thou hast made known among the peoples Thy power.
19 Thou hast redeemed Thy people with Thy arm,
The sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.
20 The waters saw Thee, O God, the waters saw Thee, and they feared;
And the deeps were troubled.
21 The multitude of the sound of waters, the clouds gave forth a voice,
And indeed Thy arrows pass through.
22 The voice of Thy thunder was in the circling heavens;
Thy lightnings did illumine the world;
The earth was shaken and trembled.
23 In the sea was Thy way, and Thy paths in many waters,
And Thy footsteps shall not be known.
24 Thou didst lead Thy people like sheep
By the hand of Moses and Aaron.

**PSALM LXXVII.**

For Instruction. A Psalm of Asaph.

1 Give heed, O My people, to My law;
Incline your ear unto the words of My mouth.
2 I will open My mouth in parables;
I will utter dark sayings from of old;
3 Which things we have heard and known,
And our fathers have recounted unto us.
4 They were not hidden from their children,
But [declared] unto another generation,
Declaring the praises of the Lord,
And His mighty acts, and His wondrous deeds which He hath wrought.
5 For He established a testimony in Jacob,
And set a law in Israel;
Whatsoever He commanded our fathers,
To make them known unto their children:
6 That another generation might know,
[Even] the sons who shall be born;
And they shall arise and declare [these things] unto their children;
7 That they might place their hope upon God,
And not forget the works of God,
But seek after His commandments;
8 That they might not become as their fathers,
A generation crooked and rebellious,
A generation that did not direct its heart aright,
And whose spirit was not faithful with God.
9 The sons of Ephraim, though stretching and shooting the bow,
Did turn back.
