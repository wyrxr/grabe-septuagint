ΑΓΓΑΙΟΣ Ι΄.
ΚΕΦΑΛΑΙΟΝ Α΄. Ι.

1 Ἐν τῷ δευτέρῳ ἔτει ἐπὶ Δαρείου τοῦ βασιλέως, ἐν τῷ μηνὶ
τῷ ἔκτῳ, μιᾷ τοῦ μηνός, ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου ἐν χειρὶ Ἀγ-
γαίου τοῦ προφήτου, λέγων· εἰπὸν δὴ πρὸς Ζοροβάβελ τὸν τοῦ
Σαλαθιὴλ τὸν ἐκ φυλῆς Ἰούδα, καὶ πρὸς Ἰησοῦν τὸν τοῦ Ἰωσε-
2 δὲκ τὸν ἱερέα τὸν μέγαν, λέγων· τάδε λέγει Κύριος παντοκρά-
τωρ, λέγων· ὁ λαὸς οὗτος λέγουσιν· οὐχ ἥκει ὁ καιρὸς τοῦ οἰ-
3 κοδομῆσαι τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου. Καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου ἐν χει-
4 ρὶ Ἀγγαίου τοῦ προφήτου, λέγων· εἰ καιρὸς ὑμῖν μέν ἐστι τοῦ
οἰκεῖν ἐν οἴκοις ὑμῶν κοιλοσταθμοῖς, ὁ δὲ οἶκος οὗτος ἐρήμω-
5 ται; Καὶ νῦν τάδε λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ· τάξατε δὴ τὰς
6 καρδίας ὑμῶν εἰς τὰς ὁδοὺς ὑμῶν. (Διότι τάδε λέγει Κύριος παν-
τοκράτωρ) ἐσπείρατε πολλά, καὶ εἰσενέγκατε ὀλίγα· ἐφάγετε,
καὶ οὐκ εἰς πλησμονήν· ἐπίετε, καὶ οὐκ εἰς μέθην· περιεβάλεσθε, καὶ
οὐκ ἐθερμάνθητε ἐν αὐτοῖς· καὶ ὁ τοὺς μισθοὺς συνάγων, συνήγα-
7 γεν εἰς δεσμὸν τετρυπημένον. Τάδε λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ·
8 θέσθε τὰς καρδίας ὑμῶν εἰς τὰς ὁδοὺς ὑμῶν· ἀνάβητε ἐπὶ τὸ ὄρος,
καὶ κόψατε ξύλα, καὶ οἰκοδομήσατε τὸν οἶκον, καὶ εὐδοκήσω ἐν
9 αὐτῷ, καὶ ἐνδοξασθήσομαι, εἶπε Κύριος. Ἐπεβλέψατε εἰς πολλά,
καὶ ἐγένοντο ὀλίγα· καὶ εἰσηνέχθη εἰς τὸν οἶκον, καὶ ἐξεφύσησα
αὐτά. Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ· ἀνθ’ ὧν ὁ
οἶκός μου ἐστὶν ἔρημος, ὑμεῖς δὲ διώκετε ἕκαστος εἰς τὸν οἶκον
10 αὐτοῦ, διὰ τοῦτο ἀνέξει ὁ οὐρανὸς ἀπὸ δρόσου, καὶ ἡ γῆ ὑπο-
11 στελεῖται τὰ ἐκφόρια αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐπάξω ῥομφαίαν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν,
καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ ὄρη, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν σῖτον, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν οἶνον, καὶ ἐπὶ
τὸ ἔλαιον, καὶ ὅσα ἐκφέρει ἡ γῆ, καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀνθρώπους,
καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ κτήνη, καὶ ἐπὶ πάντας τοὺς πόνους τῶν χειρῶν αὐ-
12 τῶν. Καὶ ἤκουσε Ζοροβάβελ ὁ τοῦ Σαλαθιὴλ ὁ ἐκ φυλῆς Ἰούδα,
καὶ Ἰησοῦς ὁ τοῦ Ἰωσεδὲκ ὁ ἱερεὺς ὁ μέγας, καὶ πάντες οἱ κα-
τάλοιποι τοῦ λαοῦ τῆς φωνῆς Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ αὐτῶν, καὶ τῶν
λόγων Ἀγγαίου τοῦ προφήτου, καθότι ἐξαπέστειλεν αὐτὸν Κύ-

HAGGAI X.
CHAPTER I.

**1** In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, on the first day of the month, the word of the Lord came by the hand of Haggai the prophet, saying: "Speak now unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, of the tribe of Judah, and unto Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, saying:"

**2** "Thus saith the Lord Almighty, saying, 'This people say, "The time is not come for the building of the house of the Lord."'"

**3** And the word of the Lord came by the hand of Haggai the prophet, saying:

**4** "Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled houses, whilst this house lieth waste?"

**5** And now, thus saith the Lord Almighty: "Set your hearts, I pray you, upon your ways."

**6** (For thus saith the Lord Almighty) "Ye have sown much, and have brought in little; ye have eaten, but not unto satiety; ye have drunk, but not unto drunkenness; ye have clothed yourselves, but ye were not warmed thereby; and he that gathereth wages, gathereth [them] into a purse with holes."

**7** Thus saith the Lord Almighty:

**8** "Set your hearts upon your ways; go up to the mountain, and fell wood, and build the house; and I will be well pleased therein, and I will be glorified," saith the Lord.

**9** "Ye looked for much, and, lo, it became little; and ye brought it into the house, and I did blow upon it. Because of this, thus saith the Lord Almighty: Forasmuch as My house is waste, and ye, each one of you, hasten unto his own house,

**10** therefore shall the heaven withhold the dew, and the earth shall withhold her fruits,

**11** and I will bring a sword upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the grain, and upon the wine, and upon the oil, and upon whatsoever the earth bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labor of their hands."

**12** And Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, of the tribe of Judah, and Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and all the remnant of the people, hearkened unto the voice of the Lord their God, and unto the words of Haggai the prophet, inasmuch as the Lord their God had sent him—
