ΚΕΦ. ΛΓ΄.
ΙΕΡΕΜΙΑΣ                                    1275
Ψευδοπροφῆται πρὸς τοὺς ἄρχοντας, καὶ παντὶ τῷ λαῷ, λέγον-
τες· κρίσις θανάτου τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ τούτῳ, ὅτι ἐπροφήτευσε κατὰ
τῆς πόλεως ταύτης, καθὼς ἠκούσατε ἐν τοῖς ὠσὶν ὑμῶν. Καὶ 12
εἶπεν Ἱερεμίας πρὸς τοὺς ἄρχοντας, καὶ παντὶ τῷ λαῷ, λέγων·
Κύριος ἀπέστειλέ με προφητεῦσαι ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον τοῦτον, καὶ ἐπὶ
τὴν πόλιν ταύτην πάντας τοὺς λόγους τούτους, οὓς ἠκούσατε.
Καὶ νῦν βελτίους ποιήσατε τὰς ὁδοὺς ὑμῶν, καὶ τὰ ἔργα ὑμῶν, 13
καὶ ἀκούσατε τῆς φωνῆς Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ὑμῶν, καὶ παύ-
σεται Κύριος ἀπὸ τῶν κακῶν, ὧν ἐλάλησεν ἐφ᾽ ὑμᾶς. Καὶ 14
ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐν χερσὶν ὑμῶν, ποιήσατέ μοι ὡς συμφέρει, καὶ ὡς
βέλτιον ὑμῖν φαίνεται· ἀλλ᾽ ἢ γνώσεσθε, ὅτι εἰ ἀναιρεῖτέ 15
με, ὅτι αἷμα ἀθῷον δίδωτε ἐφ᾽ ὑμᾶς, καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν πόλιν ταύ-
την, καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας ἐν αὐτῇ· ὅτι ἐν ἀληθείᾳ
ἀπέστειλέ με Κύριος πρὸς ὑμᾶς λαλῆσαι εἰς τὰ ὦτα ὑμῶν
πάντας τοὺς λόγους τούτους. Καὶ εἶπαν οἱ ἄρχοντες καὶ πᾶς ὁ 16
λαὸς πρὸς τοὺς ἱερεῖς καὶ πρὸς τοὺς ψευδοπροφήτας· οὐκ ἔστι
τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ τούτῳ κρίσις θανάτου, ὅτι ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι Κυρίου
τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν ἐλάλησε πρὸς ἡμᾶς. Καὶ ἀνέστησαν ἄνδρες τῶν 17
πρεσβυτέρων τῆς γῆς, καὶ εἶπαν πᾶσα τῇ συναγωγῇ τοῦ λαοῦ,
λέγοντες· Μιχαίας ὁ Μωραθίτης ἦν προφητεύων ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις 18
Ἑζεκίου βασιλέως Ἰούδα, καὶ εἶπε παντὶ τῷ λαῷ Ἰούδα, λέγων·
οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος· Σιὼν ὡς ἀγρὸς ἀροτριαθήσεται, καὶ Ἱερου-
σαλὴμ ὡς ὀπωροφυλάκιον ἔσται, καὶ τὸ ὄρος τοῦ οἴκου εἰς ἄλσος
δρυμοῦ. Μὴ ἀναῖρον ἀνεῖλεν αὐτὸν Ἑζεκίας βασιλεὺς Ἰούδα καὶ 19
πᾶς Ἰούδα; οὐχὶ ὅτι ἐφοβήθησαν τὸν Κύριον, καὶ ὅτι ἐδεήθη-
σαν τοῦ προσώπου Κυρίου; καὶ ἐπαύσατο Κύριος ἀπὸ τῶν κα-
κῶν, ὧν ἐλάλησεν ἐπ᾽ αὐτούς; καὶ ἡμεῖς ἐποιήσαμεν κακὰ μεγά-
λα ἐπὶ ψυχαῖς ἡμῶν, καὶ ἄνθρωπος ἦν προφητεύων ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνό- 20
ματι Κυρίου Οὐρίας υἱὸς Σαμαίου ἐκ Καριαθιαρείμ, καὶ ἐπρο-
φήτευσεν ἐπὶ τὴν πόλιν ταύτην, καὶ περὶ τῆς γῆς ταύτης κατὰ
πάντας τοὺς λόγους Ἱερεμίου, καὶ ἤκουσεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἰωακεὶμ 21
καὶ πάντες οἱ δυνατοὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντες οἱ ἄρχοντες πάντας
τοὺς λόγους αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐζήτουν ἀποκτεῖναι αὐτόν, καὶ ἤκουσεν
Οὐρίας, καὶ ἐφοβήθη, καὶ ἔφυγε καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς Αἴγυπτον.
Καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἰωακεὶμ ἄνδρας εἰς Αἴγυπτον, τὸν 22
Ἐλναθὰν υἱὸν Ἀχωβὼρ, καὶ ἄνδρας μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ εἰς Αἴγυπτον,

**Jeremiah, Chapter 33**

**11** false prophets unto the princes, and unto all the people, saying, "A judgment of death [is due] unto this man, for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your own ears."

**12** Then said Jeremiah unto the princes, and unto all the people, saying, "The Lord hath sent me to prophesy against this house, and against this city, all these words which ye have heard.

**13** Now therefore, amend your ways and your deeds, and hearken unto the voice of the Lord your God; and the Lord will cease from the evils which He hath spoken against you.

**14** And behold, I am in your hands; do unto me as it seemeth good and fitting unto you.

**15** But know ye assuredly, that if ye put me to death, ye shall bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants thereof; for in truth the Lord hath sent me unto you, to speak all these words in your ears."

**16** Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and unto the false prophets, "There is no judgment of death for this man, for he hath spoken unto us in the name of the Lord our God."

**17** And there stood up men of the elders of the land, and spake unto all the assembly of the people, saying,

**18** "Micah the Morasthite was prophesying in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spake unto all the people of Judah, saying, 'Thus saith the Lord: Zion shall be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become as a watchman's hut in a vineyard, and the mountain of the house [shall be] as a thicket of a forest.'

**19** Did Hezekiah king of Judah, and all Judah, indeed slay him? Did they not fear the Lord, and make supplication before the face of the Lord? And the Lord ceased from the evils which He had spoken against them. So we, too, have wrought great evils against our souls.

**20** And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the Lord, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjathjearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land, according to all the words of Jeremiah.

**21** And when Jehoiakim the king, and all his mighty men, and all the princes heard all his words, they sought to put him to death. But when Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt.

**22** And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, [even] Elnathan the son of Achbor, and men with him, into Egypt."
