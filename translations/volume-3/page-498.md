14 Ἤκουσα περὶ σοῦ, ὅτι πνεῦμα Θεοῦ ἐν σοί, καὶ γρηγόρησις, καὶ
15 σύνεσις, καὶ σοφία περισσὴ εὑρέθη ἐν σοί. Καὶ νῦν εἰσῆλθον ἐνώ-
πιον ἐμοῦ οἱ σοφοί, μάγοι, γαζαρηνοί, ἵνα τὴν γραφὴν ταύτην
ἀναγνῶσι, καὶ τὴν σύγκρισιν αὐτῆς γνωρίσωσί μοι, καὶ οὐκ ἠδυ-
16 νήθησαν ἀναγγεῖλαί μοι. Καὶ ἐγὼ ἤκουσα περὶ σοῦ, ὅτι σὺ δύ-
νασαι κρίματα συγκρίνειν· νῦν οὖν ἐὰν δυνηθῇς τὴν γραφὴν ταύ-
την ἀναγνῶναι, καὶ τὴν σύγκρισιν αὐτῆς γνωρίσαι μοι, πορφό-
ραν ἐνδύση, καὶ ὁ μανιάκης ὁ χρυσοῦς ἔσται ἐπὶ τὸν τράχηλόν
17 σου, καὶ τρίτος ἐν τῇ βασιλεία μου ἄρξεις. Τότε ἀπεκρίθη Δα-
νιήλ, καὶ εἶπεν ἐνώπιον τοῦ βασιλέως· τὰ δόματά σου σὺν σοὶ
ἔστω, καὶ τὴν δωρεὰν τῆς οἰκίας σου ἑτέρῳ δός. ἐγὼ δὲ τὴν
γραφὴν ἀναγνώσομαι τῷ βασιλεῖ, καὶ τὴν σύγκρισιν αὐτῆς γνω-
18 ρίσω σοι, βασιλεῦ· ὁ Θεὸς ὁ ὕψιστος τὴν βασιλείαν καὶ τὴν με-
γαλωσύνην καὶ τὴν τιμὴν καὶ τὴν δόξαν ἔδωκε Ναβουχοδονόσορ
19 τῷ πατρί σου, καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς μεγαλωσύνης, ἧς ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ, πάν-
τες οἱ λαοί, φυλαί, γλῶσσαι ἦσαν τρέμοντες καὶ φοβούμενοι ἀπὸ
προσώπου αὐτοῦ· οὓς ἐβούλετο αὐτὸς ἀνῄρει, καὶ οὓς ἐβούλετο
αὐτὸς ἔτυπτεν, καὶ οὓς ἐβούλετο αὐτὸς ὕψου, καὶ οὓς ἐβούλε-
20 το αὐτὸς ἐταπείνου. Καὶ ὅτε ὑψώθη ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὸ
πνεῦμα αὐτοῦ ἐκραταιώθη τοῦ ὑπερηφανεύεσθαι, κατηνέχθη ἀπὸ
τοῦ θρόνου τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἡ τιμὴ ἀφηρέθη ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ,
21 καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ἀνθρώπων ἐξεδιώχθη, καὶ ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ μετὰ τῶν
θηρίων ἐδόθη, καὶ μετὰ ἀνάγρων ἡ κατοικία αὐτοῦ, καὶ χόρτον
ὡς βοῦν ἐψώμιζον αὐτόν, καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς δρόσου τοῦ οὐρανοῦ τὸ
σῶμα αὐτοῦ ἐβάφη, ἕως οὗ ἔγνω ὅτι κυριεύει Θεὸς ὁ ὕψιστος
22 τῆς βασιλείας τῶν ἀνθρώπων, καὶ ᾧ ἐὰν δόξῃ, δώσει αὐτήν. Καὶ
σὺ ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ, Βαλτάσαρ, οὐκ ἐταπείνωσας τὴν καρδίαν σου
23 ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ· οὐ πάντα ταῦτα ἔγνως; Καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν Κύριον
Θεὸν τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ὑψώθης, καὶ τὰ σκεύη τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ ἤνεγ-
καν ἐνώπιόν σου, καὶ σὺ καὶ οἱ μεγιστάνες σου, καὶ αἱ παλλακαί
σου, καὶ αἱ παράκοιτοί σου οἶνον ἐπίνετε ἐν αὐτοῖς· καὶ τοὺς
θεοὺς τοὺς χρυσοῦς, καὶ ἀργυροῦς, καὶ χαλκοῦς, καὶ σιδηροῦς,
καὶ ξυλίνους, καὶ λιθίνους, οἳ οὐ βλέπουσι, καὶ οἳ οὐκ ἀκούουσι,
καὶ οἳ γινώσκουσιν, ἤνεσας, καὶ τὸν Θεόν, οὗ ἡ πνοή σου ἐν τῇ
24 χειρὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ πᾶσαι αἱ ὁδοί σου, αὐτὸν οὐκ ἐδόξασας; Διὰ
τοῦτο ἐκ προσώπου αὐτοῦ ἀπεστάλη ἀστράγαλος χειρός, καὶ τὴν

**14** I have heard of thee, that the Spirit of God is in thee, and that watchfulness, and understanding, and excellent wisdom hath been found in thee.

**15** And now have come in before me the wise men, the magicians, and the Gazarenes, that they might read this writing, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof; but they could not declare [it] unto me.

**16** And I have heard of thee, that thou art able to interpret difficult matters. Now therefore, if thou canst read this writing, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with purple, and the golden chain shall be upon thy neck, and as third in my kingdom shalt thou rule.

**17** Then Daniel answered and said before the king, "Let thy gifts remain with thee, and bestow the rewards of thy house upon another. Yet will I read the writing unto the king, and make known the interpretation thereof unto thee, O King.

**18** The Most High God gave the kingdom, and the greatness, and the honour, and the glory unto Nebuchadnezzar thy father.

**19** And because of the greatness which He gave him, all peoples, tribes, and tongues trembled and feared before him. Whom he wished, he slew; and whom he wished, he smote; and whom he wished, he exalted; and whom he wished, he humbled.

**20** But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit was strengthened to be proud, he was cast down from the throne of his kingdom, and his honour was taken from him.

**21** And he was driven from among men, and his heart was made as the heart of beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses; and they fed him grass as an ox, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; until he knew that the Most High God doth rule over the kingdom of men, and to whomsoever He willeth, He will give it.

**22** And thou, his son, Belshazzar, hast not humbled thy heart before God, though thou knewest all these things.

**23** But against the Lord God of heaven hast thou exalted thyself, and the vessels of His house have they brought before thee, and thou, and thy lords, and thy concubines, and thy royal consorts have drunk wine in them; and the gods of gold, and of silver, and of bronze, and of iron, and of wood, and of stone, which see not, and which hear not, and which know, hast thou praised; but the God, in whose hand is thy breath and all thy ways, Him hast thou not glorified?

**24** For this cause from His presence was sent the finger-joint of a hand, and it inscribed this writing."
