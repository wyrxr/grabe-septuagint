ΚΕΦ. Λʹ. ΛΑʹ. ΗΣΑΙΑΣ. 1163
τὸς βουνοῦ μετεώρου ὕδωρ διαπορευόμενον ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ,
ὅταν ἀπόλωνται πολλοί, καὶ ὅταν πέσωσι πύργοι. Καὶ ἔσται 26
τὸ φῶς τῆς σελήνης ὡς τὸ φῶς τοῦ ἡλίου, καὶ τὸ φῶς τοῦ
ἡλίου ἔσται ἑπταπλάσιον ὡς τὸ φῶς τῶν ἑπτὰ ἡμερῶν, ἐν τῇ
ἡμέρᾳ, ὅταν ἰάσηται Κύριος τὸ σύντριμμα τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ,
καὶ τὴν ὀδύνην τῆς πληγῆς σου ἰάσεται. Ἰδοὺ τὸ ὄνομα Κυ- 27
ρίου διὰ χρόνου ἔρχεται πολλοῦ, καιόμενος ὁ θυμὸς αὐτοῦ,
μετὰ δόξης τὸ λόγιον τῶν χειλέων αὐτοῦ, τὸ λόγιον ὀργῆς πληρες,
καὶ ἡ ὀργὴ τοῦ θυμοῦ ὡς πῦρ ἔσται· καὶ τὸ πνεῦμα αὐ- 28
τοῦ, ὡς ὕδωρ ἐν φάραγγι, σύρον ἔξει ἕως τοῦ τραχήλου, καὶ
διαιρεθήσεται, τοῦ ἔθνη ταράξαι ἐπὶ πλανήσει ματαίᾳ, καὶ διώ-
ξεται αὐτοὺς πλάνησις ματαία, καὶ λήψεται αὐτοὺς κατὰ πρό-
σωπον αὐτῶν. Μὴ διαπαντὸς δεῖ ὑμᾶς εὐφραίνεσθαι, καὶ εἰσ- 29
πορεύεσθαι εἰς τὰ ἅγιά μου διαπαντὸς ὡσεὶ ἑορτάζοντας, καὶ
ὡσεὶ εὐφραινομένους εἰσελθεῖν μετὰ αὐλοῦ εἰς τὸ ὄρος τοῦ Κυ-
ρίου πρὸς τὸν Θεὸν τοῦ Ἰσραήλ; Καὶ ἀκουστὴν ποιήσει Κύριος 30
τὸν δόξαν τῆς φωνῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὸν θυμὸν τοῦ βραχίονος αὐ-
τοῦ δείξει μετὰ θυμοῦ καὶ ὀργῆς καὶ φλογὸς κατεσθιούσης·
κεραυνώσει βιαίως, καὶ ὡς ὕδωρ καὶ χάλαζα συγκαταφερομένη
βίᾳ. Διὰ γὰρ τῆς φωνῆς Κυρίου ἡττηθήσονται οἱ Ἀσσύριοι 31
τῇ πληγῇ, ᾗ ἂν πατάξει αὐτούς· καὶ ἔσται αὐτὲν κυκλόθεν, 32
ὅθεν ἂν αὐτῷ ἡ ἐλπὶς τῆς βοηθείας, ἐφ᾽ ᾗ αὐτὸς ἐπεποίθει·
αὐτοὶ μετὰ τυμπάνων καὶ κιθάρας πολεμήσουσιν αὐτὸν ἐκ μετα-
βολῆς. Σὺ γὰρ πρὸ ἡμερῶν ἀπατηθήσῃ· μὴ καὶ σοὶ ἡτοι- 33
μάσθη βασιλεύειν φάραγγα βαθεῖαν ξύλα κείμενα, πῦρ
ξύλα πολλά; ὁ θυμὸς Κυρίου ὡς . ξ ὑπὸ θείου καιομένη.

ΚΕΦ. ΛΑ. XXXI.

ΟΥΑΙ οἱ καταβαίνοντες εἰς Αἴγυπτον ἐπὶ βοήθειαν, οἱ 1
ἐφ᾽ ἵπποις πεποιθότες καὶ ἐφ᾽ ἅρμασιν· ἔστι γὰρ πολλά, καὶ
ἐφ᾽ ἵπποις πλῆθος σφόδρα· καὶ οὐκ ἦσαν πεποιθότες ἐπὶ τὸν
ἅγιον τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ τὸν Κύριον οὐκ ἐξεζήτησαν, καὶ αὐτὸς 2
σοφὸς ἤγεν ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς κακά, καὶ ὁ λόγος αὐτοῦ οὐ μὴ ἀθετη-
θῇ, καὶ ἐπαναστήσεται ἐπ᾽ οἴκους ἀνθρώπων πονηρῶν, καὶ ἐπὶ
τὴν ἐλπίδα αὐτῶν τὴν ματαίαν, Αἰγύπτιον ἄνθρωπον, καὶ οὐ 3

**Chapter 30**
**25** ...even of the lofty hill, water flowing forth in that day, when many shall perish, and when towers shall fall.
**26** And the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of the seven days, in that day when the Lord shall heal the breach of His people, and the pain of thy wound shall He heal.
**27** Behold, the Name of the Lord cometh after much time, His wrath burning, with glory the word of His lips, a word full of wrath, and the fierceness of His anger shall be as fire;
**28** and His spirit, like water in a ravine, shall drag [them] forth even to the neck, and shall divide [them], to trouble the nations with vain error; and vain error shall pursue them, and shall seize them before their face.
**29** Shall ye not continually rejoice, and enter into My holy places continually as those who keep a feast, and as those rejoicing to enter with a flute unto the mountain of the Lord, unto the God of Israel?
**30** And the Lord shall make audible the glory of His voice, and the wrath of His arm shall He show with fury and indignation and a consuming flame; He shall thunder violently, and as water and hail violently borne down together.
**31** For by the voice of the Lord shall the Assyrians be overthrown by the blow wherewith He shall strike them.
**32** And it shall be 'auten' round about, whence for him [cometh] the hope of aid, on which he himself trusted; they shall make war against him in turn with timbrels and harps.
**33** For thou shalt be deceived beforehand. Shall not also for thee be prepared, for the king, a deep valley with wood lying there, much wood for fire? The wrath of the Lord, as [a dot and the letter] Xi, consumed by brimstone and burning.

**Chapter 31**
**1** WOE unto them that go down to Egypt for help, that trust in horses, and in chariots! For they are many, and in horses a multitude exceeding great; yet they trusted not in the Holy One of Israel, neither did they seek the Lord.
**2** But He is wise, and shall bring evil upon them; and His word shall not be set aside. And He shall rise up against the houses of wicked men, and against their vain hope,
**3** even the Egyptian, who is but man and not God; and [their] horses, [being but] flesh, and there is no help.
