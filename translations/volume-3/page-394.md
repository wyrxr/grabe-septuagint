αὐτοῦ, ὁ ἄνομος ἐκεῖνος ἐν τῇ ἀδικίᾳ αὐτοῦ ἀποθανεῖται, καὶ σὺ
20 τὴν ψυχήν σου ἐρύσω. Καὶ ἐν τῷ ἀποστρέφειν δίκαιον ἀπὸ τῆς
δικαιοσύνης αὐτοῦ, καὶ ποιήσῃ παράπτωμα, καὶ δώσω τὴν βάσανον
εἰς πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ, αὐτὸς ἀποθανεῖται, ὅτι οὐ διεστέιλω
αὐτῷ· καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις αὐτοῦ ἀποθανεῖται, διότι οὐ μὴ
μνησθῶσιν αἱ δικαιοσύναι αὐτοῦ ἃς ἐποίησε, καὶ τὸ αἷμα αὐτοῦ
21 ἐκ τῆς χειρός σου ἐκζητήσω. Σὺ δὲ ἐὰν διαστείλῃ τῷ δικαίῳ τοῦ μὴ
ἁμαρτάνειν, καὶ αὐτὸς μὴ ἁμάρτῃ, ὁ δίκαιος ζωῇ ζήσεται, ὅτι
22 διεστέιλω αὐτῷ, καὶ σὺ τὴν ψυχήν σου ρύσῃ. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐπ᾿
ἐμὲ χεὶρ Κυρίου, καὶ εἶπε πρός μέ· ἀνάστηθι, καὶ ἐξελθε εἰς τὸ
23 πεδίον, καὶ ἐκεῖ λαληθήσεται πρός σέ. Καὶ ἀνέστην καὶ ἐξῆλθον
εἰς τὸ πεδίον· καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐκεῖ δόξα Κυρίου εἰστήκει, καθὼς ἡ δράσις
καὶ καθὼς ἡ δόξα, ἣν ἴδον ἐπὶ τοῦ ποταμοῦ τοῦ Χοβάρ· καὶ
24 πίπτω ἐπὶ πρόσωπόν μου, καὶ ἦλθεν ἐπ᾿ ἐμὲ πνεῦμα, καὶ ἔστησέ
με ἐπὶ πόδας μου, καὶ ἐλάλησε πρός μέ, καὶ εἶπέ μοι· εἴσελθε, καὶ
25 ἐγκλείσθητι ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ οἴκου σου. Καὶ σὺ υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, ἰδοὺ δέδονται
ἐπὶ σὲ δεσμοί, καὶ δήσουσί σε ἐν αὐτοῖς, καὶ σὺ οὐ μὴ ἐξέλθῃς
26 ἐκ μέσου αὐτῶν. Καὶ τὴν γλῶσσάν σου συνδήσω πρὸς τὸν
φάρυγγά σου, καὶ ἀποκωφωθήσῃ, καὶ οὐκ ἔσῃ αὐτοῖς εἰς ἄνδρα
27 ἐλέγχοντα, διότι οἶκος παραπικραίνων ἐστί.

ΚΕΦ. Δ΄. IV.

1 ΚΑΙ σὺ υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, λάβε σεαυτῷ πλίνθον, καὶ θήσεις αὐτὴν
πρὸ προσώπου σου, καὶ διαγράψεις ἐπ᾿ αὐτὴν πόλιν τὴν Ἱερουσαλὴμ,
2 καὶ δώσεις ἐπ᾿ αὐτὴν περιοχήν, καὶ οἰκοδομήσεις ἐπ᾿ αὐτὴν
προμαχῶνας, καὶ περιβαλεῖς ἐπ᾿ αὐτὴν χάρακα, καὶ δώσεις
ἐπ᾿ αὐτὴν παρεμβολάς, καὶ τάξεις τὰς βελοστάσεις κύκλῳ.
3 Καὶ σὺ λάβε σεαυτῷ τήγανον σιδηροῦν, καὶ θήσεις αὐτὸ τοῖχον
σιδηροῦν ἀναμέσον σου καὶ ἀναμέσον τῆς πόλεως, καὶ ἑτοιμάσεις
τὸ πρόσωπόν σου ἐπ᾿ αὐτὴν, καὶ ἔσται ἐν συγκλεισμῷ, καὶ
συγκλείσεις αὐτήν· σημεῖον ἐστι τοῦτο τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ.
4 Καὶ σὺ κοιμηθήσῃ ἐπὶ τὸ πλευρόν σου τὸ ἀριστερόν, καὶ θή-

### Chapter 3

**20** his way, that lawless one shall die in his iniquity, and thou
    shalt deliver thy soul. And when a righteous man turneth from his
    righteousness, and committeth transgression, and I give a stumbling-block
    before his face, he himself shall die, because thou didst not warn
    him; and in his sins shall he die, because his righteous deeds
    which he did shall not be remembered, and his blood
    I shall require at thy hand.
**21** But if thou warn the righteous one not to sin, and he doth not
    sin, that righteous one shall surely live, because thou didst warn him,
    and thou shalt deliver thy soul.
**22** And the hand of the Lord came upon me, and He said unto me,
    “Arise, and go forth into the plain, and there shall it be spoken
    unto thee.”
**23** And I arose and went forth into the plain; and behold, the glory
    of the Lord stood there, as the vision and as the glory which
    I had seen by the river Chebar;
**24** and I fell upon my face; and the Spirit came upon me, and set me
    upon my feet, and spoke unto me, and said unto me, “Enter, and
**25** be shut up in the midst of thy house. And thou, Son of man,
    behold, bonds have been laid upon thee, and they shall bind thee
    with them, and thou shalt in no wise go forth from their midst.
**26** And I shall bind thy tongue to thy throat, and thou shalt be
    made mute, and thou shalt not be unto them a man rebuking,
    because it is a house that embittereth [Me].
**27** But when I speak unto thee, I shall open thy mouth, and thou
    shalt say unto them, ‘Thus saith the Lord Lord: he that heareth,
    let him hear; and he that is disobedient, let him be disobedient’;
    for it is a house that embittereth [Me].”

### Chapter 4

**1** AND thou, Son of man, take unto thee a brick, and thou shalt lay it
    before thy face, and thou shalt inscribe upon it the city of Jerusalem,
**2** and thou shalt set against it a siege, and thou shalt build against it
    bulwarks, and thou shalt cast up a mound against it, and thou shalt set
    against it encampments, and thou shalt array the battering rams round about.
**3** And thou shalt take unto thee an iron pan, and thou shalt set it
    as an iron wall betwixt thee and betwixt the city, and thou shalt prepare
    thy face against it, and it shall be in a state of siege, and thou shalt
    besiege it; this is a sign unto the sons of Israel.
**4** And thou shalt lie down upon thy left side, and thou shalt lay
