42 αὐταῖς, καὶ ἁγιασθήσομαι ἐν ὑμῖν κατ᾿ ὀφθαλμοὺς τῶν λαῶν. Καὶ
  ἐπιγνώσεσθε, ὅτι ἐγὼ Κύριος, ἐν τῷ εἰσαγαγεῖν με ὑμᾶς εἰς τὴν γῆν
  τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, εἰς τὴν γῆν, εἰς ἣν ᾖρα τὴν χεῖρά μου τοῦ δοῦναι αὐτὴν
43 τοῖς πατράσιν ὑμῶν. Καὶ μνησθήσεσθε ἐκεῖ τὰς ὁδοὺς ὑμῶν καὶ
  τὰ ἐπιτηδεύματα ὑμῶν, ἐν οἷς ἐμιαίνεσθε ἐν αὐτοῖς, καὶ κόψεσθε
  τὰ πρόσωπα ὑμῶν ἐν πάσαις ταῖς κακίαις ὑμῶν αἷς ἐποιήσατε,
44 καὶ ἐπιγνώσεσθε, διότι ἐγὼ Κύριος, ἐν τῷ ποιῆσαί με οὕτως ὑμῖν,
  ὅπως τὸ ὄνομά μου μὴ βεβηλωθῇ κατὰ τὰς ὁδοὺς ὑμῶν τὰς κακὰς
  καὶ κατὰ τὰ ἐπιτηδεύματα ὑμῶν τὰ διεφθαρμένα, οἶκος Ἰσραήλ,
  λέγει Ἀδωναὶ Κύριος.
45 Καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς μέ, λέγων·
46 υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, στήρισον τὸ πρόσωπόν σου ἐπὶ Θαιμάν, καὶ ἐπίβλεψον
  ἐπὶ Δρῶμα, καὶ προφήτευσον
47 ἐπὶ δρυμὸν ἡγούμενον Ναγέβ, καὶ ἐρεῖς τῷ δρυμῷ Ναγέβ· ἄκουε
  λόγον Κυρίου· τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεός Ἰσραήλ· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἀνάπτω
  ἐν σοὶ πῦρ, καὶ καταφάγεται ἐν σοὶ πᾶν ξύλον χλωρὸν καὶ πᾶν
  ξύλον ξηρόν, οὐ σβεσθήσεται ἡ φλὸξ ἡ ἐξαφθεῖσα, καὶ κατακαυθήσεται
  ἐν αὐτῇ πᾶν πρόσωπον ἀπὸ ἀπηλιώτου ἕως βορρᾶ.
48 Καὶ ἐπιγνώσεται πᾶσα σάρξ, ὅτι ἐγὼ Κύριος ἐξέκαυσα αὐτό,
49 καὶ οὐ σβεσθήσεται ἔτι. Καὶ εἶπα· μηδαμῶς, Κύριε Κύριε, αὐτοὶ
  λέγουσι πρὸς μέ, οὐχὶ παραβολή ἐστι λεγομένη αὕτη;

1 ΚΑὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς μέ, λέγων· υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου,
2 διὰ τοῦτο προφήτευσον, καὶ στήρισον τὸ πρόσωπόν σου ἐπὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ,
  καὶ ἐπίβλεψον ἐπὶ τὰ ἅγια αὐτῶν, καὶ προφητεύσεις
3 ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς τὴν γῆν τοῦ Ἰσραήλ·
  τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεός· Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ πρὸς σέ, καὶ ἐκσπάσω τὸ
  ἐγχειρίδιόν μου ἐκ τοῦ κολεοῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐξολοθρεύσω ἐκ σοῦ ἄδικον
  καὶ ἄνομον.
4 Ἀφ᾿ ὧν ἐξολοθρεύσω ἐκ σοῦ ἄδικον καὶ ἄνομον, οὕτως ἐξελεύσεται
  τὸ ἐγχειρίδιόν μου ἐκ τοῦ κολεοῦ αὐτοῦ
5 ἐπὶ πᾶσαν σάρκα ἀπὸ ἀπηλιώτου ἕως βορρᾶ, καὶ ἐπιγνώσεται
  πᾶσα σάρξ, ὅτι ἐγὼ Κύριος ἐξέσπασα τὸ ἐγχειρίδιόν μου ἐκ τοῦ
6 κολεοῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἀποστρέψει οὐκέτι. Καὶ σύ, υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου,
  καταστέναξον ἐν συντριβῇ ὀσφύος σου, καὶ ἐν ὀδύναις στενάξεις
7 κατ᾿ ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἔσται ἐὰν εἴπωσι πρὸς σέ, ἕνεκα τί-

**42** ...them; and I shall be sanctified in your midst in the sight of the peoples. And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I bring you into the land of Israel, into the land concerning which I lifted up My hand to give it unto your fathers.
**43** And ye shall remember there your ways, and your practices, in which ye defiled yourselves thereby; and ye shall smite your faces for all your wickednesses which ye have committed.
**44** And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall deal with you thus, that My Name may not be profaned according to your evil ways and according to your corrupt practices, O house of Israel, saith Adonai the Lord.

**45** And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
**46** "Son of man, set thy face towards Thaiman, and look towards Droma, and prophesy
**47** against the leading forest of Negeb. And thou shalt say to the forest of Negeb: Hear the word of the Lord! Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel: Behold, I will kindle in thee a fire, and it shall devour in thee every green tree and every dry tree. The kindled flame shall not be quenched, and every face shall be burned within it, from the east even unto the north.
**48** And all flesh shall know that I the Lord have kindled it,
**49** and it shall not be quenched anymore." Then I said, "No, by no means, O Lord, Lord! They say unto me, 'Is not this a parable being spoken?'"

### Chapter 21

**1** And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, "Son of man,
**2** therefore prophesy, and set thy face toward Jerusalem, and look towards their holy places, and thou shalt prophesy
**3** against the land of Israel, and thou shalt say to the land of Israel: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I am against thee, and I will draw My dagger from its sheath, and I will destroy from thee the unrighteous and the lawless.
**4** From the [time] that I shall destroy from thee the unrighteous and the lawless, thus My dagger shall come forth from its sheath
**5** upon all flesh, from the east even unto the north. And all flesh shall know that I the Lord have drawn My dagger from its
**6** sheath, and it shall not return anymore. And thou, O son of man, groan with the breaking of thy loins, and with pangs shalt thou groan
**7** in their sight. And it shall be, if they say unto thee, 'For what [cause]-' "
