ΑΜΩΣ.
ΚΕΦ. Ζ'. VII.

θυγατέρες σου ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ πεσοῦνται, καὶ ἡ γῆ σου ἐν σχοινίῳ
καταμετρηθήσεται, καὶ σὺ ἐν γῇ ἀκαθάρτῳ τελευτήσεις· ὁ δὲ
Ἰσραὴλ αἰχμάλωτος ἀχθήσεται ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς αὐτοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. Η'. VIII.

1   Οὕτως ἔδειξέ μοι Κύριος Κύριος, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἄγγος ἐξευτοῦ. Καὶ
2   εἶπε· τί σὺ ὁρᾷς, Ἀμώς; Καὶ εἶπα· ἄγγος ἐξευτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπε
    Κύριος πρὸς μέ· ἥκει τὸ πέρας ἐπὶ τὸν λαόν μου Ἰσραὴλ, οὐκέτι
3   μὴ προσθῶ τοῦ παρελθεῖν αὐτόν· καὶ ὀλολύζει τὰ φαντώματα
    τοῦ ναοῦ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, λέγει Κύριος Κύριος· πολὺς ὁ πε-
4   πτωκὼς ἐν παντὶ τόπῳ, ἐπιρίψω σιωπήν. Ἀκούσατε δὴ ταῦτα
    οἱ ἐκτρίβοντες εἰς τὸ πρωί πενήντα, καὶ καταδυναστεύοντες πτω-
5   χοὺς ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς, οἱ λέγοντες· πότε διελεύσεται ὁ μὴν, καὶ
    ἐμπολήσομεν, καὶ τὰ σάββατα, καὶ ἀνοίξομεν θησαυρὸν, τοῦ ποιῆ-
    σαι μικρὸν μέτρον, καὶ τοῦ μεγαλῦναι στάθμιον, καὶ ποιῆσαι
6   ζυγὸν ἄδικον, τοῦ κτᾶσθαι ἐν ἀργυρίῳ πτωχοὺς καὶ ταπεινὸν ἀν-
    τὶ ὑποδημάτων, καὶ ἀπὸ παντὸς γεννήματος ἐμπορευσόμεθα;
7   Ὀμνύει Κύριος καθ᾽ ὑπερηφανίας Ἰακὼβ, εἰ ἐπιλήσεται εἰς νῖκος
8   πάντα τὰ ἔργα ὑμῶν· καὶ ἐπὶ τούτοις οὐ ταραχθήσεται ἡ γῆ,
    καὶ πενθήσει πᾶς ὁ κατοικῶν ἐν αὐτῇ; καὶ ἀναβήσεται ὡς ποτα-
9   μὸς συντέλεια, καὶ καταβήσεται ὡς ποταμὸς Αἰγύπτου. Καὶ
    ἔσται ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ, λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς, καὶ δύσεται ὁ
    ἥλιος μεσημβρίας, καὶ συσκοτάσει ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς ἐν ἡμέρᾳ τὸ φῶς
10  καὶ μεταστρέψω τὰς ἑορτὰς ὑμῶν εἰς πένθος, καὶ πάσας τὰς
    ᾠδὰς ὑμῶν εἰς θρῆνον, καὶ ἀναβιῶ ἐπὶ πᾶσαν ὀσφῦν σάκκον, καὶ
    ἐπὶ πᾶσαν κεφαλὴν φαλάκρωμα, καὶ θήσομαι αὐτὸν ὡς πένθος
11  ἀγαπητοῦ, καὶ τοὺς μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ ὡς ἡμέραν ὀδύνης. Ἰδοὺ ἡμέραι
    ἔρχονται, λέγει Κύριος, καὶ ἐξαποστελῶ λιμὸν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, οὐ
    λιμὸν ἄρτου οὐδὲ δίψαν ὕδατος, ἀλλὰ λιμὸν τοῦ ἀκοῦσαι τὸν
12  λόγον Κυρίου· καὶ σαλευθήσεται ὕδατα ἕως θαλάσσης, καὶ ἀπὸ βο-
    ῤῥᾶ ἕως ἀνατολῶν περιδραμοῦνται ζητοῦντες τὸν λόγον τοῦ Κυρίου,
13  καὶ οὐ μὴ εὕρωσιν. Ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἐκλείψουσιν αἱ παρθένοι
14  αἱ καλαὶ, καὶ οἱ νεανίσκοι ἐν δίψει, οἱ ὀμνύοντες κατὰ τοῦ ἱλα-
    σμοῦ Σαμαρείας, καὶ οἱ λέγοντες· Ζῇ Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου, καὶ ζῇ
    ὁ Θεός σου Βηρσαβεέ· καὶ πεσοῦνται, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἀναστῶσιν ἔτι.

**CHAPTER 7**

**17** ...and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be measured with a line, and thou shalt die in an unclean land; but Israel shall be led away captive from his own land.

**CHAPTER 8**

**1** Thus the Lord, even the Lord, showed unto me; and behold, a basket of Exeutou.
**2** And He said, "What seest thou, Amos?" And I said, "A basket of Exeutou." And the Lord said unto me, "The end is come upon My people Israel; I will no longer pass him by."
**3** And the phantoms of the temple shall howl in that day, saith the Lord, even the Lord; many shall be the fallen in every place, and I will cast forth silence.
**4** Hear ye this, O ye who crush fifty in the morning, and oppress the poor from the land,
**5** who say, "When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell our wares? And the Sabbaths, that we may open our treasure, to make the measure small, and to magnify the weight, and to make an unjust balance;
**6** to buy the poor for silver, and the humble for a pair of shoes; yea, and to trade in all manner of produce?"
**7** The Lord hath sworn by the excellency of Jacob, [saying], "Surely I will not forget forever all your works."
**8** And for these things, shall not the earth be troubled, and every one that dwelleth therein mourn? Yea, the utter destruction shall rise up as a river,
**9** and shall come down as the river of Egypt. And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord God, that the sun shall go down at noon, and the light shall be darkened upon the earth in the day.
**10** And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; and I shall live again upon every loin sackcloth, and upon every head baldness; and I will make it as the mourning for an only son, and those with him as a day of anguish.
**11** Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will send a famine upon the land; not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but a famine for hearing the word of the Lord;
**12** and waters shall be tossed even unto the sea; and from the north even unto the east shall they run to and fro, seeking the word of the Lord,
**13** and shall not find it. In that day shall the fair virgins faint, and the young men for thirst,
**14** they who swear by the propitiation of Samaria, and say, "As the Lord thy God liveth," and, "As thy god of Beersheba liveth;" they shall fall, and shall not rise up again.
