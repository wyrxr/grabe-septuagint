21 τρίβων δικαιώματος ἀναστρέφομαι· ἵνα μερίσω τοῖς ἐμὲ ἀγαπῶσιν
22 ὕπαρξιν, καὶ τοὺς θησαυροὺς αὐτῶν ἐμπλήσω ἀγαθῶν. Ἐὰν ἀναγ-
23 γείλω ὑμῖν τὰ καθ᾿ ἡμέραν γινόμενα, μνημονεύσω τὰ ἐξ αἰῶνος
24 ἀριθμῆσαι. Κύριος ἔκτισέ με ἀρχὴν ὁδῶν αὐτοῦ εἰς ἔργα αὐτοῦ·
25 πρὸ τοῦ αἰῶνος ἐθεμελίωσέ με· ἐν ἀρχῇ, πρὸ τοῦ τὴν γῆν ποιῆ-
26 σαι, καὶ πρὸ τοῦ τὰς ἀβύσσους ποιῆσαι, πρὸ τοῦ προελθεῖν τὰς
27 πηγὰς τῶν ὑδάτων, πρὸ τοῦ ὄρη ἑδρασθῆναι, πρὸ δὲ πάντων βου-
28 νῶν γεννᾷ με. Κύριος ἐποίησε χώρας καὶ ἀοικήτους, καὶ ἄκρα
29 οἰκούμενα τῆς ὑπ᾿ οὐρανόν. Ἡνίκα ἡτοίμαζε τὸν οὐρανόν, συμ-
30 παρήμην αὐτῷ, καὶ ὅτε ἀφώριζε τὸν ἑαυτοῦ θρόνον ἐπ᾿ ἀνέμων,
31 ἡνίκα ἰσχυρὰ ἐποίει τὰ ἄνω νέφη· καὶ ὡς ἀσφαλεῖς ἐτίθει πηγὰς
32 τῆς ὑπ᾿ οὐρανόν, ἐν τῷ τιθέναι αὐτὸν τῇ θαλάσσῃ ἀκριβασμὸν αὐ-
33 τοῦ, καὶ ὕδατα οὐ παρελεύσονται στόματος αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὡς ἰσχυρὰ
34 ἐποίει τὰ θεμέλια τῆς γῆς, ἤμην παρ᾿ αὐτῷ ἁρμόζουσα· ἐγὼ ἤμην,
35 ᾗ προσέχαιρε, καθ᾿ ἡμέραν δὲ εὐφραινόμην ἐν προσώπῳ αὐτοῦ ἐν
36 παντὶ καιρῷ, ὅτε ηὐφραίνετο τὴν οἰκουμένην συντελέσας, καὶ ἐνηὐφραίνετο ἐν υἱοῖς ἀνθρώπων.
37 Νῦν οὖν υἱὲ ἄκουέ μου· καὶ μακάριοι οἱ ὁδοὺς μου φυλάξουσιν.
38 Ἀκούσατε παιδείαν καὶ σοφίσθητε, καὶ μὴ ἀποφραγῆτε.
39 Μακάριος ἀνὴρ ὃς εἰσακούσεταί μου, καὶ ἄνθρωπος ὃς τὰς ἐμὰς
40 ὁδοὺς φυλάξει, ἀγρυπνῶν ἐπ᾿ ἐμαῖς θύραις καθ᾿ ἡμέραν, τηρῶν
41 σταθμοὺς ἐμῶν εἰσόδων· αἱ γὰρ ἔξοδοί μου ἔξοδοι ζωῆς, καὶ
42 ἑτοιμάζεται θέλησις παρὰ Κυρίου.
43 Οἱ δὲ εἰς ἐμὲ ἁμαρτάνοντες, ἀσεβοῦσιν εἰς τὰς ἑαυτῶν ψυχάς·
44 καὶ οἱ μισοῦντές με, ἀγαπῶσι θάνατον.

1 Ἡ Σοφία ᾠκοδόμησεν ἑαυτῇ οἶκον, καὶ ὑπήρεισε στύλους ἑπτά·
2 ἔσφαζε τὰ ἑαυτῆς θύματα, ἐκέρασεν εἰς κρατῆρα τὸν ἑαυτῆς οἶ-
3 νον, καὶ ἡτοιμάσατο τὴν ἑαυτῆς τράπεζαν. Ἀπέστειλε τοὺς ἑαυ-
4 τῆς δούλους, συγκαλοῦσα μετὰ ὑψηλοῦ κηρύγματος ἐπὶ κρατῆρα,
5 λέγουσα· ὃς ἔστιν ἄφρων, ἐκκλινάτω πρὸς μέ· καὶ τοῖς ἐνδεέσι
6 φρενῶν εἶπεν· ἔλθατε, φάγετε τῶν ἐμῶν ἄρτων, καὶ πίετε οἶνον
7 ὃν ἐκέρασα ὑμῖν. Ἀπολείπετε ἀφροσύνην, (ἵνα εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα βα-

**CHAPTER VIII.**

21 of the paths of righteousness I turn myself,
    That I may apportion unto them that love me
22 substance, and fill their treasuries with good things.
    Should I declare unto you the things which come to pass
23 day by day, I shall recount the things from eternity,
24 that they may be numbered. The Lord created me as the beginning of His ways, for His works;
25 Before the ages, He established me; in the beginning, before He made the earth,
26 And before He made the deeps, before the springs of the waters issued forth,
27 Before the mountains were established, and before all the hills He begets me.
28 The Lord made the lands and the uninhabited places, and the inhabited extremities
29 of the world beneath the heaven.
    When He prepared the heavens, I was with Him;
30 And when He marked out His throne upon the winds,
31 When He made strong the clouds above; and as He surely set the springs
32 beneath the heaven; when He gave unto the sea its precise boundary,
33 and the waters should not pass His decree; and when He made strong
34 the foundations of the earth, I was by Him, as one that ordaineth [all things];
35 I was [the one] in whom He took delight, and daily I did rejoice in His presence
36 at every time, when He rejoiced, having completed the inhabited earth, and did greatly rejoice in the sons of men.
37 Now therefore, my son, hearken unto me; and blessed are they who shall keep my ways.
38 Hearken unto instruction and be ye made wise, and be not ye unheeding.
39 Blessed is the man that heareth me, and the man that shall keep my
40 ways; watching daily at my gates, and keeping
41 the doorposts of my entrances; for my goings forth are goings forth of life, and
42 favor is prepared by the Lord.
43 But they that sin against me, they do impiety against their own souls;
44 and they that hate me, love death.

**CHAPTER IX.**

1 Wisdom hath built her house, and hath established her seven pillars;
2 She hath slain her sacrifices, she hath mingled her wine into a bowl,
3 and hath prepared her table. She hath sent forth her
4 bondservants, calling together with a loud proclamation to the bowl,
5 saying, "Whoso is foolish, let him turn in to me;" and to them that are lacking
6 in understanding she saith, "Come ye, eat of my bread, and drink the wine
7 which I have mingled for you. Forsake foolishness, (that ye may
8 reign forever; and seek prudence,) that ye may live; and rectify ye
9 understanding in knowledge."
    He that instructeth the wicked, shall receive unto himself dishonour;
