YMN. B´. ΨΑΛΤΗΡΙΟΝ. 1053
πρεσβυτέρους σου, καὶ ἐροῦσί σοι. 8
ὡς διέσπειρεν υἱοὺς Ἀδάμ, ἔστησεν ὅρια ἐθνῶν κατὰ ἀριθμὸν ἀγγέλων Θεοῦ· καὶ ἐγενήθη μερὶς Κυρίου λαὸς αὐτοῦ Ἰακώβ, σχοίνισμα κληρονομίας αὐτοῦ Ἰσραήλ. 10
Αὐτάρκησεν αὐτὸν ἐν γῇ ἐρήμῳ, ἐν δίψει καύματος ἐν ἀνύδρῳ· ἐκύκλωσεν αὐτὸν καὶ ἐπαίδευσεν αὐτὸν, καὶ διεφύλαξεν αὐτὸν ὡς κόρην ὀφθαλμοῦ. 11
Ὡς ἀετὸς σκεπάσαι νοσσιὰν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπὶ τοῖς νεοσσοῖς αὐτοῦ ἐπεπότησεν· διείς τὰς πτέρυγας αὐτοῦ, ἐδέξατο αὐτοὺς, καὶ ἀνέλαβεν αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ τῶν μεταφρένων αὐτοῦ. 12
Κύριος μόνος ἦγεν αὐτοὺς, καὶ οὐκ ἦν μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ Θεὸς ἀλλότριος. 13
Ἀνεβίβασεν αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ τὴν ἰσχὺν τῆς γῆς, ἐψώμισεν αὐτοὺς γενήματα ἀγρῶν· ἐθήλασαν μέλι ἐκ πέτρας, καὶ ἔλαιον ἐκ στερεᾶς πέτρας, 14
βούτυρον βοῶν καὶ γάλα προβάτων, μετὰ στέατος ἀρνῶν καὶ κριῶν, υἱῶν ταύρων καὶ τράγων, μετὰ στέατος νεφρῶν πυροῦ, καὶ αἷμα σταφυλῆς ἔπιον οἶνον. 15
Καὶ ἔφαγεν Ἰακὼβ καὶ ἐνεπλήσθη, καὶ ἀπελάκτισεν ὁ ἠγαπημένος· ἐλιπάνθη, ἐπαχύνθη, ἐπλατύνθη· καὶ ἐγκατέλειπε Θεὸν τὸν ποιήσαντα αὐτὸν, καὶ ἀπέστη ἀπὸ Θεοῦ σωτῆρος αὐτοῦ. 16
Παρώξυναν με ἐπ᾿ ἀλλοτρίοις, ἐν βδελύγμασιν αὐτῶν ἐξεπίκρανάν με· 17
ἔθυσαν δαιμονίοις, καὶ οὐ Θεῷ, θεοῖς οἷς οὐκ ᾔδεισαν· καινοὶ καὶ πρόσφατοι ἤκασιν, οὓς οὐκ ᾔδεισαν οἱ πατέρες αὐτῶν. 18
Θεὸν τὸν γεννήσαντά σε ἐγκατέλιπες, καὶ ἐπελάθου Θεοῦ τοῦ τρέφοντός σε. 19
Καὶ εἶδε Κύριος, καὶ ἐζήλωσε, καὶ παρωξύνθη δι᾿ ὀργὴν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ καὶ θυγατέρων· 20
καὶ εἶπεν· ἀποστρέψω τὸ πρόσωπόν μου ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν, καὶ δείξω τί ἔσται αὐτοῖς ἐπ᾿ ἐσχάτων· ὅτι γενεὰ ἐξεστραμμένη ἐστὶν, υἱοὶ οἷς οὐκ ἔστι πίστις ἐν αὐτοῖς. 21
Αὐτοὶ παρεζήλωσάν με ἐπ᾿ οὐ Θεῷ, παρώργισάν με ἐν τοῖς εἰδώλοις αὐτῶν· κἀγὼ παραζηλώσω αὐτοὺς ἐπ᾿ οὐκ ἔθνει, ἐπ᾿ ἔθνει ἀσυνέτῳ παροργιῶ αὐτούς. 22
Ὅτι πῦρ ἐκκέκαυται ἐκ τοῦ θυμοῦ μου, καυθήσεται ἕως ᾅδου κάτω· καταφάγεται γῆν καὶ τὰ γεννήματα αὐτῆς, φλέξει θεμέλια ὀρέων. 23
Συνάξω εἰς αὐτοὺς κακὰ, καὶ τὰ βέλη μου συντελέσω εἰς αὐτούς. 24
Τηκόμενοι λιμῷ καὶ βρώσει ὀρνέων, καὶ ὀπισθότονος ἀνίατος· ὀδόντας θηρίων ἐξαποστελῶ εἰς αὐτοὺς, μετὰ θυμοῦ συρόντων ἐπὶ γῆς. 25
Ἔξωθεν ἀτεκνώσει αὐτοὺς μάχαιρα, καὶ ἐκ τῶν ταμείων φόβος· νεανίσκος σὺν παρθένῳ, θηλάζων μετὰ καθεστηκότος πρεσβυτέρου· 26
εἶπα· διασπερῶ αὐτοὺς, καταπαύσω δὴ ἐξ ἀνθρώπων τὸ μνημόσυνον αὐτῶν· 27
εἰ μὴ δι᾿ ὀργὴν ἐχθρῶν, ἵνα μὴ μακροχρονίσωσι, καὶ ἵνα μὴ συνεπίθωνται οἱ ὑπεναντίοι, μὴ εἴπωσιν· ἡ χεὶρ ἡμῶν ὑψηλὴ, καὶ οὐχὶ Κύριος ἐποίησε ταῦτα πάντα.

**The Second Ode: The Song of Moses in Deuteronomy [continued].**

**8** thy elders, and they shall declare [it] unto thee.
    When the Most High did apportion lands unto the nations,
    when He did scatter the sons of Adam,
    He set the boundaries of the peoples according to the number of the angels of God;
**9** And the Lord's portion became His people, Jacob;
    the measuring-line of His inheritance, Israel.
**10** He did sustain him in a desert land,
    in the thirst of burning heat, in a waterless [place];
    He encompassed him and instructed him,
    and guarded him as the pupil of His eye.
**11** As an eagle doth protect its nest,
    and over its young ones doth hover;
    passing through his wings, he received them,
    and took them up upon his pinions.
**12** The Lord alone did lead them,
    and there was no strange god with Him.
**13** He caused them to ascend upon the strength of the earth,
    He fed them with the produce of the fields;
    they sucked honey from the rock,
    and oil from the solid rock,
**14** butter of kine and milk of sheep,
    with the fat of lambs and of rams,
    young bulls and of goats,
    with the fat of the kidneys of wheat;
    and the blood of the grape they drank [as] wine.
**15** And Jacob ate and was filled,
    and the beloved did spurn [Him];
    he grew fat, he grew thick, he grew broad;
    and he forsook God Who had made him,
    and departed from God his Savior.
**16** They provoked Me to jealousy with strange [gods],
    with their abominations they embittered Me;
**17** They sacrificed unto demons, and not to God;
    to gods whom they knew not,
    new [gods] and freshly come, whom their fathers knew not.
**18** The God Who begat thee didst thou forsake,
    and didst forget God Who nourished thee.
**19** And the Lord saw [it], and was jealous,
    and was provoked to wrath because of His sons and daughters;
**20** And He said, "I will turn away My face from them,
    and I will show what shall befall them in the last days;
    for they are a perverse generation,
    sons in whom there is no faith.
**21** They have made Me jealous with that which is no god,
    they have provoked Me to wrath with their idols;
    and I will make them jealous with a no-nation,
    with a foolish nation will I provoke them to wrath.
**22** For a fire hath been kindled from My wrath,
    it shall burn down unto the lowest Hades;
    it shall consume the earth and its produce,
    it shall set aflame the foundations of the mountains.
**23** I shall heap evils upon them,
    and My arrows shall I spend upon them.
**24** They shall be wasted by famine and by the consumption of birds,
    and by incurable spasm;
    I will send forth upon them the teeth of beasts,
    with the fury of those that drag themselves upon the earth.
**25** Without, the sword shall make them childless,
    and within their chambers [shall be] terror;
    the young man with the virgin,
    the sucking child with the established elder.
**26** I said, 'I will scatter them,
    I will cause their remembrance to cease from among men;'
**27** were it not for the wrath of the enemies,
    lest they should boast too long,
    and lest the adversaries should combine [against them],
    lest they should say, 'Our hand is high,
    and the Lord hath not done all these things.'"
