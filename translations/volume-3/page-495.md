ΚΕΦ. Δʹ.
ΔΑΝΙΗΛ.
Τὸ δένδρον ὃ εἶδες τὸ μεγαλυνθὲν καὶ τὸ ἰσχυκός, οὗ τὸ ὕψος
ἔφθανεν εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν, καὶ τὸ κῦτος αὐτοῦ εἰς πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν,
καὶ τὰ φύλλα αὐτοῦ εὐθαλῆ καὶ ὁ καρπὸς αὐτοῦ πολύς, καὶ τρο-
φὴ πᾶσιν ἐν αὐτῷ· ὑποκάτω αὐτοῦ κατώικουν τὰ θηρία τὰ ἄ-
γρια, καὶ ἐν τοῖς κλάδοις αὐτοῦ κατεσκήνουν τὰ ὄρνεα τοῦ οὐ-
ρανοῦ, σὺ εἶ, βασιλεῦ, ὅτι ἐμεγαλύνθης καὶ ἰσχύτας, καὶ ἡ με-
γαλωσύνη σου ἐμεγαλύνθη, καὶ ἔφθασεν εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν, καὶ ἡ
κυρεία σου εἰς τὰ πέρατα τῆς γῆς. Καὶ ἔτι εἶδεν ὁ βασιλεὺς
εἷς, καὶ ἅγιον καταβαίνοντα ἀπὸ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ εἶπεν, ἐκτί-
λατε τὸ δένδρον, καὶ διαφθείρατε αὐτό, πλὴν τὴν φυὴν τῶν ῥι-
ζῶν αὐτοῦ ἐάσατε ἐν τῇ γῇ, καὶ ἐν δεσμῷ σιδηρῷ καὶ ἐν χαλ-
κῷ, καὶ ἐν τῇ χλόῃ τῇ ἔξω, καὶ ἐν τῇ δρόσῳ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ αὐλι-
σθήσεται, καὶ μετὰ θηρίων ἀγρίων ἡ μερὶς αὐτοῦ, ἕως οὗ ἑπτὰ
καιροὶ ἀλλοιωθῶσιν ἐπ᾿ αὐτόν· τοῦτο ἡ σύγκρισις αὐτοῦ, βασι-
λεῦ, καὶ σύγκριμα ὑψίστου ἐστιν, ὃ ἔφθασεν ἐπὶ τὸν Κύριόν μου
τὸν βασιλέα, καὶ σὲ ἐκδιώξουσιν ἀπὸ τῶν ἀνθρώπων, καὶ μετὰ
θηρίων ἀγρίων ἔσται ἡ κατοικία σου, καὶ χόρτον ὡς βοῦν ψω-
μιοῦσί σε, καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς δρόσου τοῦ οὐρανοῦ αὐλισθήσῃ, καὶ ἑπτὰ
καιροὶ ἀλλαγήσονται ἐπὶ σέ, ἕως οὗ γνῷς, ὅτι κυριεύει ὁ ὕψι-
στος τῆς βασιλείας τῶν ἀνθρώπων, καὶ ᾧ ἂν δόξῃ, δώσει αὐτήν.
Καὶ ὅτι εἶπαν, ἐάσατε τὴν φυὴν τῶν ῥιζῶν τοῦ δένδρου· ἡ βα-
σιλεία σου σοι μένει, ἀφ᾿ ἧς ἂν γνῷς τὴν ἐξουσίαν τὴν οὐράνιον.
Διὰ τοῦτο, βασιλεῦ, ἡ βουλή μου ἀρεσάτω σοι, καὶ τὰς ἁμαρ-
τίας σου ἐν ἐλεημοσύναις λύτρωσαι, καὶ τὰς ἀδικίας σου ἐν οἰ-
κτιρμοῖς πενήτων· ἴσως ἔσται μακρόθυμος τοῖς παραπτώμασί σου
ὁ Θεός. Ταῦτα πάντα ἔφθασεν ἐπὶ Ναβουχοδονόσορ τὸν βασι-
λέα. Μετὰ δωδεκάμηνον, ἐπὶ τῷ ναῷ τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ ἐν
Βαβυλῶνι περιπατῶν, ἀπεκρίθη ὁ βασιλεύς, καὶ εἶπεν, οὐχ αὕ-
τη ἐστὶ Βαβυλὼν ἡ μεγάλη, ἣν ἐγὼ ὠικοδόμησα εἰς οἶκον βασι-
λείας, ἐν τῷ κράτει τῆς ἰσχύος μου, εἰς τιμὴν τῆς δόξης μου;
Ἔτι τοῦ λόγου ἐν τῷ στόματι τοῦ βασιλέως ὄντος, φωνὴ ἀπ᾿
οὐρανοῦ ἐγένετο, σοὶ λέγουσι Ναβουχοδονόσορ βασιλεῦ, ἡ βασι-
λεία σου παρῆλθεν ἀπὸ σοῦ, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ἀνθρώπων σε ἐκ-
διώκουσι, καὶ μετὰ θηρίων ἀγρίων ἡ κατοικία σου, καὶ χόρτον
ὡς βοῦν ψωμιοῦσί σε, καὶ ἑπτὰ καιροὶ ἀλλαγήσονται ἐπὶ σέ, ἕως
οὗ γνῷς ὅτι κυριεύει ὁ ὕψιστος τῆς βασιλείας τῶν ἀνθρώπων,

**17** The tree which thou sawest, the [one] magnified and the mighty [tree], whose height reached unto heaven, and the bulk thereof unto all the earth; and its leaves were flourishing and its fruit abundant, and food for all was in it; beneath it dwelt the wild beasts, and in its branches lodged the fowls of the heaven: thou art that tree, O King, for thou hast been magnified and hast waxed strong, and thy greatness hath been magnified, and hath reached unto heaven, and thy dominion unto the ends of the earth.

**18** And further, the King saw one, and a holy one descending from heaven, and he said: "Strip off the tree, and destroy it; nevertheless, leave the stump of its roots in the earth, and in a bond of iron and in bronze, and in the grass outside; and with the dew of heaven shall it lie down, and with the wild beasts shall its portion be, until seven times shall pass over him."

**19** This is its interpretation, O King, and it is a decree of the Most High, which hath reached upon my Lord the King: and they shall drive thee out from among men, and with the wild beasts shall thy dwelling be; and they shall feed thee grass like an ox, and from the dew of heaven shalt thou lodge, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou shalt know that the Most High ruleth over the kingdom of men, and to whomsoever it shall please Him, He will give it.

**20** And because they said, "Leave the stump of the roots of the tree," thy kingdom remaineth unto thee, from the time that thou shalt know the heavenly dominion.

**21** Therefore, O King, let my counsel please thee, and redeem thy sins by almsgiving, and thine iniquities by mercies toward the poor; perhaps God will be longsuffering toward thy transgressions.

**22** All these things came upon Nebuchadnezzar the King.

**23** After twelve months, as he walked upon the temple of his kingdom in Babylon, the King answered and said, "Is not this great Babylon, which I have built for a house of the kingdom, in the might of my strength, for the honor of my glory?"

**24** While the word was yet in the mouth of the King, a voice came from heaven, saying unto thee, O King Nebuchadnezzar, "Thy kingdom hath departed from thee, and from among men shall they drive thee out, and with the wild beasts shall thy dwelling be, and they shall feed thee grass like an ox, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou shalt know that the Most High ruleth over the kingdom of men."
