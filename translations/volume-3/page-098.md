**ΨΑΛΜ. ΡΚΑ´. CXXI.**
4 λις, ἧς ἡ μετοχὴ αὐτῆς· ἐπιτοαυτό. Ἐκεῖ γὰρ ἀνέβησαν αἱ φυλαί, αἱ φυλαὶ Κυρίου, μαρτύριον τῷ Ἰσραήλ, τοῦ ἐξομολογήσασθαι τῷ ὀνόματι Κυρίου·
5 ὅτι ἐκεῖ ἐκάθισαν θρόνοι εἰς κρίσιν, θρόνοι ἐπ᾿ οἴκον Δαυΐδ.
6 Ἐρωτήσατε (δὴ) τὰ εἰς εἰρήνην τὴν Ἱερουσαλήμ·
7 καὶ εὐθηνία τοῖς ἀγαπῶσι σε· γενέσθω (δὲ) εἰρήνη ἐν τῇ δυνάμει σου, καὶ εὐθηνία ἐν ταῖς πυργοβάρεσί σου.
8 Ἕνεκεν τῶν ἀδελφῶν μου καὶ τῶν πλησίον μου ἐλάλουν δὴ εἰρήνην περὶ σοῦ·
9 ἕνεκεν τοῦ οἴκου Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν ἐξεζήτησα ἀγαθά σοι.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ΡΚΒ´. CXXII.**

1 ὨΔΗ τῶν ἀναβαθμῶν. Πρὸς σὲ ἦρα τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς μου, τὸν κατοικοῦντα ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ.
2 Ἰδοὺ ὡς ὀφθαλμοὶ δούλων εἰς χεῖρας τῶν κυρίων αὐτῶν, ὡς ὀφθαλμοὶ παιδίσκης εἰς χεῖρας τῆς κυρίας αὐτῆς· οὕτως οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ ἡμῶν πρὸς Κύριον τὸν Θεὸν ἡμῶν, ἕως οὗ οἰκτειρῆσαι ἡμᾶς.
3 Ἐλέησον ἡμᾶς Κύριε, ἐλέησον ἡμᾶς, ὅτι ἐπὶ πολὺ ἐπλήσθημεν ἐξουδενώσεως·
4 ἐπὶ πλεῖον ἐπλήσθη ἡ ψυχὴ ἡμῶν· τὸ ὄνειδος τοῖς εὐθηνοῦσι, καὶ ἡ ἐξουδένωσις τοῖς ὑπερηφάνοις.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ΡΚΓ´. CXXIII.**

1 ὨΔΗ τῶν ἀναβαθμῶν. Εἰ μὴ ὅτι Κύριος ἦν ἐν ἡμῖν, εἰπάτω (δὴ) Ἰσραήλ·
2 εἰ μὴ ὅτι Κύριος ἦν ἐν ἡμῖν, ἐν τῷ ἐπαναστῆναι ἀνθρώπους ἐφ᾿ ἡμᾶς,
3 ἄρα ζῶντας ἂν κατέπιον ἡμᾶς, ἐν τῷ ὀργισθῆναι τὸν θυμὸν αὐτῶν ἐφ᾿ ἡμᾶς·
4 ἄρα τὸ ὕδωρ κατεπόντισεν ἡμᾶς,
5 χείμαῤῥον διῆλθεν ἡ ψυχὴ ἡμῶν· ἄρα διῆλθεν ἡ ψυχὴ ἡμῶν τὸ ὕδωρ τὸ ἀνυπόστατον.
6 Εὐλογητὸς Κύριος, ὃς οὐκ ἔδωκεν ἡμᾶς εἰς θήραν τοῖς ὀδοῦσιν αὐτῶν.
7 Ἡ ψυχὴ ἡμῶν ὡς στρουθίον ἐῤῥύσθη ἐκ τῆς παγίδος τῶν θηρευόντων· ἡ παγὶς συνετρίβη, καὶ ἡμεῖς ἐῤῥύσθημεν.
8 Ἡ βοήθεια ἡμῶν ἐν ὀνόματι Κυρίου, τοῦ ποιήσαντος τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ τὴν γῆν.

**PSALM 121 (LXX 121).**

**4** ...city, whose communion [is] with herself; [being knit] together. For thither did the tribes ascend,
   the tribes of the Lord, as a testimony unto Israel, to give praise unto the name of the Lord.
**5** For there did the thrones for judgment sit, even thrones for the house of David.
**6** Ask [now] for the peace of Jerusalem;
**7** And prosperity [be] unto them that love thee. Let [yet] peace be within thy strength, and prosperity within thy bulwarks.
**8** For my brethren's sake, and for my companions' sake, I have [indeed] spoken peace concerning thee.
**9** For the sake of the house of the Lord our God, I have sought good things for thee.

**PSALM 122 (LXX 122).**

*A Song of Ascents.*
**1** Unto Thee have I lifted up mine eyes, O Thou that dwellest in the heavens.
**2** Behold, as the eyes of servants [look] unto the hands of their masters, as the eyes of a handmaiden unto the hands of her mistress;
   so do our eyes [look] unto the Lord our God, until He shall have mercy upon us.
**3** Have mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us, for greatly have we been filled with scorn;
**4** Yea, even more hath our soul been filled: [we have become] a reproach to them that prosper, and a scorn to the arrogant.

**PSALM 123 (LXX 123).**

*A Song of Ascents.*
**1** If the Lord had not been among us, let Israel [now] say;
**2** If the Lord had not been among us, when men rose up against us,
**3** Then would they have swallowed us alive, when their wrath was kindled against us.
**4** Then would the waters have overwhelmed us,
**5** A torrent would our soul have passed through; then would our soul have passed through the irresistible water.
**6** Blessed be the Lord, Who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth.
**7** Our soul hath been delivered as a sparrow from the snare of the fowlers; the snare is broken, and we are delivered.
**8** Our help [is] in the name of the Lord, Who made the heaven and the earth.

**PSALM 124 (LXX 124).**

*A Song of Ascents.*
**1** They that trust in the Lord, [shall be] as Mount
