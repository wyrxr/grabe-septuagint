ῥέθη ἐν ἐμοί, καὶ ἐνώπιον δέ σου, βασιλεῦ, παράπτωμα οὐκ ἐποίησα.
**23** Τότε ὁ βασιλεὺς πολὺ ἠγαθύνθη ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ, καὶ τὸν Δανιὴλ εἶπεν ἀνενέγκαι ἐκ τοῦ λάκκου· καὶ ἀνήχθη Δανιὴλ ἐκ τοῦ λάκκου, καὶ πᾶσα διαφθορὰ οὐχ εὑρέθη ἐν αὐτῷ, ὅτι ἐπίστευσεν ἐν τῷ Θεῷ αὐτοῦ.
**24** Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεύς, καὶ ἤγαγον τοὺς ἄνδρας τοὺς διαβαλόντας τὸν Δανιήλ, καὶ εἰς τὸν λάκκον τῶν λεόντων ἐβλήθησαν αὐτοί, καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτῶν, καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες αὐτῶν· καὶ οὐκ ἔφθασαν εἰς τὸ ἔδαφος τοῦ λάκκου, ἕως οὗ ἐκυρίευσαν αὐτῶν οἱ λέοντες, καὶ πάντα τὰ ὀστᾶ αὐτῶν ἐλέπτυναν.
**25** Τότε ὁ βασιλεὺς Δαρεῖος ἔγραψε πᾶσι τοῖς λαοῖς, φυλαῖς, γλώσσαις, τοῖς οἰκοῦσιν ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ· εἰρήνη ὑμῖν πληθυνθείη.
**26** Ἐκ προσώπου μου ἐτέθη δόγμα, τοῦ ἐν πάσῃ ἀρχῇ τῆς βασιλείας μου εἶναι τρέμοντας καὶ φοβουμένους ἀπὸ προσώπου τοῦ Θεοῦ Δανιήλ, ὅτι αὐτὸς Θεὸς ζῶν, καὶ μένων εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας, καὶ ἡ βασιλεία αὐτοῦ οὐ διαφθαρήσεται, καὶ ἡ κυριεία αὐτοῦ ἕως τέλους.
**27** Ἀντιλαμβάνεται καὶ σώζεται, καὶ ποιεῖ σημεῖα καὶ τέρατα ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, ὅστις ἐξείλατο τὸν Δανιὴλ ἐκ χειρὸς τῶν λεόντων.
**28** Καὶ Δανιὴλ κατηύθυνεν ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ Δαρείου, καὶ ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ Κύρου τοῦ Πέρσου.

**1** Ἐν ἔτει πρώτῳ τῷ Βαλτάσαρ βασιλέως Χαλδαίων, Δανιὴλ ἐνύπνιον ἴδε, καὶ αἱ δράσεις τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τῆς κοίτης αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὸ ἐνύπνιον ἔγραψεν.
**2** Ἐγὼ Δανιὴλ ἐθεώρουν ἐν ὁράματι τῆς νυκτός· καὶ ἰδοὺ οἱ τέσσαρες ἄνεμοι τοῦ οὐρανοῦ προσέβαλον εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν τὴν μεγάλην,
**3** καὶ τέσσαρα θηρία μεγάλα ἀνέβαινον ἐκ τῆς θαλάσσης, διαφέροντα ἀλλήλων.
**4** Τὸ πρῶτον ὡσεὶ λέαινα ἔχουσα πτερά, καὶ πτερὰ αὐτῆς ὡς ἀετοῦ· ἐθεώρουν ἕως οὗ ἐξετίλη τὰ πτερὰ αὐτῆς· καὶ ἐξήρθη ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἐπὶ ποδῶν ἀνθρώπου ἐστάθη, καὶ καρδία ἀνθρώπου ἐδόθη αὐτῇ.
**5** Καὶ ἰδοὺ θηρίον δεύτερον ὅμοιον ἄρκῳ, καὶ εἰς μέρος ἓν ἐστάθη, καὶ τρία πλευρὰ ἐν τῷ στόματι αὐτῆς, ἀναμέσον τῶν ἐδόντων αὐτῆς· καὶ οὕτως ἔλεγον αὐτῇ, Ἀνάστηθι, φάγε σάρκας [πολλάς].

**22** ...was found in me; and before thee, O King, no fault have I committed."
**23** Then the king was exceedingly glad concerning him, and commanded to bring Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was brought up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found in him, because he had trusted in his God.
**24** And the king commanded, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel, and they were cast into the den of lions, they, and their sons, and their wives. And they had not reached the bottom of the den, until the lions had overcome them, and crushed all their bones.
**25** Then King Darius wrote unto all peoples, nations, and tongues, that dwell in all the earth: "Peace be multiplied unto you.
**26** From before me, a decree is made, that in every dominion of my kingdom men shall tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for He is the Living God, and abiding unto the ages, and His Kingdom shall not be destroyed, and His Dominion shall be even unto the end.
**27** He delivers and saves, and He works signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, Who hath delivered Daniel from the hand of the lions."
**28** So Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.

### Chapter 7

**1** In the first year of Belshazzar, king of the Chaldeans, Daniel saw a dream and the visions of his head upon his bed. And he wrote the dream.
**2** I, Daniel, beheld in a vision by night; and, behold, the four winds of heaven strove upon the great sea,
**3** and four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.
**4** The first was like a lioness, having wings, and her wings were like an eagle's. I beheld until her wings were plucked, and she was lifted up from the earth, and stood upon the feet of a man, and a man's heart was given to her.
**5** And, behold, another beast, a second, like unto a bear, and it stood on one side, and three ribs were in the mouth of it, between its teeth; and thus they said unto it, "Arise, devour much flesh."
