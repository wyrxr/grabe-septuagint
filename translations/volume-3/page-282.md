19 ἕως τῆς καρδίας σου. Τὴν κοιλίαν μου, τὴν κοιλίαν μου ἀλγῶ,
   καὶ τὰ αἰσθητήρια τῆς καρδίας μου μαιμάσσει ἡ ψυχή μου, σπα-
   ράσσεται ἡ καρδία μου· οὐ σιωπήσομαι, ὅτι φωνὴν σάλπιγγος
20 ἤκουσεν ἡ ψυχή μου, κραυγὴν πολέμου. Καὶ ταλαιπωρίαν καὶ
   συντριμμὸν ἐπικαλεῖται, ὅτι τεταλαιπώρηκε πᾶσα ἡ γῆ, ἄφνω
   τεταλαιπώρηκε σκηνή, διεσπάσθησαν αἱ δέρρεις μου.
21 Ἕως πότε ὄψομαι φεύγοντας ἀκούων φωνὴν σαλπίγγων;
22 Διότι οἱ ἡγούμενοι τοῦ λαοῦ μου ἐμὲ οὐκ ᾔδεισαν· υἱοὶ ἄφρονές
   εἰσι καὶ οὐ συνετοί, σοφοὶ εἰσι τοῦ κακοποιῆσαι, τὸ δὲ καλῶς
   ποιῆσαι οὐκ ἔγνωσαν.
23 Ἐπέβλεψα ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, καὶ ἰδοὺ οὐθέν, καὶ εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν,
   καὶ οὐκ ἦν τὰ φῶτα αὐτοῦ.
24 Ἴδον τὰ ὄρη, καὶ ἦν τρέμοντα, καὶ πάντας τοὺς βουνοὺς
   ταρασσομένους.
25 Ἐπέβλεψα, καὶ ἰδοὺ οὐκ ἦν ἄνθρωπος, καὶ πάντα τὰ πετεινὰ
   τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ἐπτοεῖτο.
26 Ἴδον, καὶ ἰδοὺ ὁ Κάρμηλος ἔρημος, καὶ πᾶσαι αἱ πόλεις
   ἐμπεπυρισμέναι πυρὶ ἀπὸ προσώπου Κυρίου, καὶ ἀπὸ προ-
   σώπου ὀργῆς θυμοῦ αὐτοῦ ἠφανίσθησαν.
27 Τάδε λέγει Κύριος· ἔρημος ἔσται πᾶσα ἡ γῆ, συντέλειαν δὲ οὐ
   μὴ ποιήσω.
28 Ἐπὶ τούτοις πενθείτω ἡ γῆ, καὶ συσκοτασάτω ὁ οὐρανὸς
   ἄνωθεν· διότι ἐλάλησα, παρατέταγμαι, καὶ οὐ μετανοήσω·
   ὥρμησα, καὶ οὐκ ἀποστρέψω ἀπ᾿ αὐτῆς.
29 Ἀπὸ φωνῆς ἱππέως, καὶ ἐντεταμένου τό-
   ξου ἀνεχώρησε πᾶσα ἡ χώρα· εἰσέδυσαν εἰς τὰ σπήλαια, καὶ
   εἰς τὰ ἄλση ἐκρύβησαν, καὶ εἰς τὰς πέτρας ἀνέβησαν· πᾶσα
   πόλις ἐγκατελείφθη, οὐ κατώκει ἐν αὐταῖς ἄνθρωπος.
30 Καὶ σὺ ἡ τα-
   λαίπωρος, τί ποιήσεις ἐὰν περιβάλῃ κόκκινον, καὶ κοσμήσῃ κό-
   σμῳ χρυσῷ, καὶ ἐὰν ἐγχρίσῃ στίμμη τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς σου, εἰς
   μάτην ὁ ὡραϊσμός σου· ἀπώσαντό σε οἱ ἐρασταί σου, τὴν ψυχὴν
   σου ζητήσουσιν,
31 ὅτι φωνὴν ὡς ὠδινούσης ἤκουσα τοῦ στεναγμοῦ
   σου, ὡς πρωτοτοκούσης, φωνὴ θυγατρὸς Σιὼν ἐκλυθήσεται, καὶ
   παρήσει τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῆς· οἴμοι ἐγὼ, ὅτι ἐκλείπει ἡ ψυχή μου
   ἐπὶ τοῖς ἀνηρημένοις.

ΚΕΦ. Ε'. V.
1  ΠΕΡΙΔΡΑΜΕΤΕ ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς Ἱερουσαλὴμ, καὶ ἴδετε, καὶ
   γνῶτε, καὶ ζητήσατε ἐν ταῖς πλατείαις αὐτῆς· ἐὰν εὕρητε ἄν-
   δρα, εἰ ἔστι ποιῶν κρίμα, καὶ ζητῶν πίστιν, καὶ ἵλεως ἔσομαι

### Chapter 4

**19** My belly, my belly, I am pained! And my soul doth make the senses of my heart to rage; my heart is torn within me. I will not be silent, for my soul hath heard the voice of the trumpet, [even] the cry of war.
**20** And I cry out [for] havoc and destruction, for all the land is brought low; suddenly is the dwelling brought low, and my curtains are torn asunder.
**21** How long shall I behold [those who] flee, hearing the voice of trumpets?
**22** For the rulers of My people knew Me not. They are foolish children and without understanding; they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.
**23** I looked upon the earth, and behold, there was nought; and unto the heavens, and their lights were not [there].
**24** I saw the mountains, and they were trembling, and all the hills were in commotion.
**25** I looked, and behold, there was no man; and all the fowls of the heaven were terrified.
**26** I looked, and behold, Carmel was a wilderness, and all the cities were burned with fire from the presence of the Lord, and from the presence of the fierceness of His wrath were they annihilated.
**27** Thus saith the Lord: The whole land shall be desolate; yet a full end will I not make.
**28** For these things shall the earth mourn, and the heaven above shall be darkened; because I have spoken, I have purposed, and I will not repent; I have set forth, and I will not turn back from it.
**29** From the voice of the horseman, and the drawn bow, the whole land hath fled; they entered into the caves, and hid themselves in the groves, and went up upon the rocks; every city was forsaken, and no man dwelt therein.
**30** And thou, O wretched one, what wilt thou do if thou shouldst array thyself in scarlet, and deck thyself with ornaments of gold, and though thou shouldst paint thine eyes with kohl? In vain is thy beautification; thy lovers have cast thee off, they shall seek thy life,
**31** for I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, the groaning as of one giving birth to her firstborn, the voice of the daughter of Zion: she shall faint, and let down her hands. Woe is me! for my soul faileth because of those who are slain.

### Chapter 5

**1** Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and search in the broad ways thereof; if ye can find a man, if there be any that executeth judgment, and that seeketh faithfulness, then will I be merciful [unto them].
