¹² κεῖται, καὶ ἡσυχάζει. Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη ὁ ἄγγελος Κυρίου, καὶ εἶπε· Κύριε παντοκράτωρ, ἕως τίνος οὐ μὴ ἐλεήσεις τὴν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ τὰς πόλεις Ἰούδα, ἃς ὑπερεῖδες τοῦτο ἑβδομηκοστὸν ¹³ ἔτος; Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Κύριος παντοκράτωρ τῷ ἀγγέλῳ τῷ λαλοῦντι ἐν ἐμοί, ῥήματα καλὰ καὶ λόγους παρακλητικούς. ¹⁴ Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς μέ ὁ ἄγγελος ὁ λαλῶν ἐν ἐμοί· ἀνάκραχε λέγων· τάδε λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ· ἐζήλωκα τὴν Ἱερουσαλὴμ καὶ τὴν ¹⁵ Σιὼν ζῆλον μέγαν, καὶ ὀργὴν μεγάλην ἐγὼ ὀργίζομαι ἐπὶ τὰ ἔθνη τὰ συνεπιτιθέμενα· ἀνθ’ ὧν ἐγὼ μὲν ὠργίσθην ὀλίγα, αὐτοὶ ¹⁶ δὲ συνεπέθεντο εἰς κακά. Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ· ἐπιστρέφω ἐπὶ Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐν οἰκτιρμῷ, καὶ ὁ οἶκός μου ἀνοικοδομηθήσεται ἐν αὐτῇ, λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ, καὶ μέτρον ¹⁷ ἐκταθήσεται ἐπὶ Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἔτι. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς μέ ὁ ἄγγελος ὁ λαλῶν ἐν ἐμοί· ἀνάκραχε λέγων· τάδε λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ· ἔτι διαχυθήσονται πόλεις ἐν ἀγαθοῖς, καὶ ἐλεήσει Κύριος ἔτι τὴν Σιὼν, καὶ αἱρετιεῖ (Κύριος) τὴν Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἔτι. ¹⁸ Καὶ ἦρα τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς μου, καὶ ἴδον, καὶ ἰδοὺ τέσσαρα κέρατα. ¹⁹ Καὶ εἶπα πρὸς τὸν ἄγγελον τὸν λαλοῦντα ἐν ἐμοί· τί ἐστι ταῦτα Κύριε; καὶ εἶπε πρὸς μέ· ταῦτα τὰ κέρατα τὰ διασκορπίσαντα ²⁰ τὸν Ἰούδαν καὶ τὸν Ἰσραὴλ καὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ ἔδειξέ μοι Κύριος ²¹ τέσσαρας τέκτονας. Καὶ εἶπα· τί οὗτοι ἔρχονται ποιῆσαι; Καὶ εἶπε (πρός μέ) ταῦτα τὰ κέρατα τὰ διασκορπίσαντα τὸν Ἰούδαν, καὶ τὸν Ἰσραὴλ κατέαξαν, καὶ οὐδεὶς αὐτῶν ἦρε κεφαλήν· καὶ εἰσῆλθον οὗτοι τοῦ ὀξῦναι αὐτὰ εἰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν τὰ τέσσαρα κέρατα, τὰ ἔθνη τὰ ἐπαιρόμενα κέρας ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν Κυρίου, τοῦ διασκορπίσαι αὐτήν.

ΚΕΦ. Βʹ.

¹ ΚΑΙ ἦρα τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς μου, καὶ ἴδον, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἀνὴρ, καὶ ἐν τῇ ² χειρὶ αὐτοῦ σχοινίον γεωμετρικόν. Καὶ εἶπα πρὸς αὐτόν· ποῦ σὺ πορεύῃ; Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς μέ· διαμετρῆσαι τὴν Ἱερουσαλήμ, τοῦ ἰδεῖν πη³ λίκον τὸ πλάτος αὐτῆς, καὶ πηλίκον τὸ μῆκος. Καὶ ἰδοὺ ὁ ἄγγελος ὁ λαλῶν ἐν ἐμοί, εἰστήκει, καὶ ἄγγελος ἕτερος ἐξεπορεύετο εἰς ⁴ ἀπάντησιν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτόν, λέγων· Δράμε, καὶ λάλησον πρὸς τὸν νεανίαν ἐκεῖνον, λέγων· κατακάρπως κατοικηθήσεται Ἱερουσαλήμ.

**Zechariah [Chapter] 1.**

**12** ...lieth still, and is at rest." So answered the Angel of the Lord, and said, "O Lord Almighty, how long wilt Thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, which Thou hast overlooked for these seventy years?"

**13** And the Lord Almighty answered the Angel that talked with me with good words and comfortable words.

**14** Then said the Angel that talked with me, "Cry thou, saying: 'Thus saith the Lord Almighty: I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.

**15** And with a great wrath am I wroth against the nations that laid upon them affliction; for whereas I was but a little wroth, they have furthered the evil.'"

**16** "Therefore thus saith the Lord Almighty: 'I return unto Jerusalem with mercies, and My house shall be built therein,' saith the Lord Almighty, 'and the measuring line shall yet be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.'"

**17** And the Angel that talked with me said unto me, "Cry yet again, saying: 'Thus saith the Lord Almighty: My cities shall yet be overflowed with good things, and the Lord shall yet have mercy upon Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.'"

**18** Then I lifted up mine eyes and saw, and behold, four horns.

**19** And I said unto the Angel that talked with me, "What are these, my Lord?" And he answered me, "These are the horns which have scattered Judah and Israel and Jerusalem."

**20** And the Lord showed me four craftsmen.

**21** And I said, "What come these to do?" And he said unto me, "These are the horns which scattered Judah, and have broken Israel, so that none of them lifted his head. And these are come to sharpen them by their hands—even the four horns, [even] the nations that lifted up a horn against the land of the Lord, to scatter it."

**Chapter 2.**

**1** Then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold, a man, and in his hand a measuring line.

**2** And I said unto him, "Whither goest thou?" And he said unto me, "To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its breadth, and what is its length."

**3** And behold, the Angel that talked with me stood forth, and another Angel came out to meet him.

**4** And he said unto him, saying, "Run, and speak unto that young man, saying: 'Jerusalem shall be inhabited abundantly;'"
