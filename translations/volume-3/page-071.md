**ΨΑΛΜ. ϟΑʹ. XCI.**

8 μίαν, ὅπως ἂν ἐξολεθρευθῶσιν εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τοῦ αἰῶνος.
9 Σὺ δὲ ὕψιστος εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα Κύριε.
10 Ὅτι ἰδοὺ οἱ ἐχθροί σου Κύριε, ὅτι ἰδοὺ οἱ ἐχθροί σου ἀπολοῦνται,
καὶ διασκορπισθήσονται πάντες οἱ ἐργαζόμενοι τὴν ἀνομίαν.
11 Καὶ ὑψωθήσεται ὡς μονοκέρωτος τὸ κέρας μου,
καὶ τὸ γῆράς μου ἐν ἐλαίῳ πίονι·
12 καὶ ἐπεῖδεν ὁ ὀφθαλμός μου ἐν τοῖς ἐχθροῖς μου,
καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἐπανισταμένοις ἐπ᾿ ἐμὲ πονηρευομένοις ἀκούσεται τὸ οὖς μου.
13 Δίκαιος ὡς φοῖνιξ ἀνθήσει·
ὡσεὶ κέδρος ἡ ἐν τῷ Λιβάνῳ πληθυνθήσεται.
14 Πεφυτευμένοι ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ Κυρίου
ἐν ταῖς αὐλαῖς τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν ἐξανθήσουσιν·
15 ἔτι πληθυνθήσονται ἐν γήρει πίονι,
καὶ εὐπαθοῦντες ἔσονται·
16 τοῦ ἀναγγεῖλαι, ὅτι εὐθὺς Κύριος ὁ Θεός μου,
καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἀδικία ἐν αὐτῷ.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ϟΒʹ. XCII.**
ΕΙΣ τὴν ἡμέραν τοῦ σαββάτου, ὅτε κατῴκισται ἡ γῆ, αἶνος ᾠδῆς τῷ Δαυίδ.

1 Ὁ Κύριος ἐβασίλευσεν, εὐπρέπειαν ἐνεδύσατο·
ἐνεδύσατο Κύριος δύναμιν καὶ περιεζώσατο·
καὶ γὰρ ἐστερέωσε τὴν οἰκουμένην, ἥτις οὐ σαλευθήσεται.
2 Ἕτοιμος ὁ θρόνος σου ἀπὸ τότε·
ἀπὸ τοῦ αἰῶνος σὺ εἶ.
3 Ἐπῆραν οἱ ποταμοὶ Κύριε,
ἐπῆραν οἱ ποταμοὶ φωνὰς αὐτῶν·
ἀροῦσιν οἱ ποταμοὶ ἐπιτριβὰς αὐτῶν,
ἀπὸ φωνῶν ὑδάτων πολλῶν.
4 Θαυμαστοὶ οἱ μετεωρισμοὶ τῆς θαλάσσης·
θαυμαστὸς ἐν ὑψηλοῖς ὁ Κύριος.
5 Τὰ μαρτύριά σου ἐπιστώθησαν σφόδρα·
τῷ οἴκῳ σου πρέπει ἁγίασμα Κύριε εἰς μακρότητα ἡμερῶν.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ϟΓʹ. XCIII.**
ΨΑΛΜΟΣ ᾠδῆς τῷ Δαυίδ, τετράδι σαββάτου.

1 Θεὸς ἐκδικήσεων Κύριος,
Θεὸς ἐκδικήσεων ἐπαῤῥησιάσατο.
2 Ὑψώθητι ὁ κρίνων τὴν γῆν,
ἀπόδος ἀνταπόδοσιν τοῖς ὑπερηφάνοις.
3 Ἕως πότε ἁμαρτωλοὶ Κύριε,
ἕως πότε ἁμαρτωλοὶ καυχήσονται;
4 Φθέγξονται καὶ λαλήσουσιν ἀδικίαν,
λαλήσουσι πάντες οἱ ἐργαζόμενοι τὴν ἀνομίαν;
5 Τὸν λαόν σου Κύριε ἐταπείνωσαν,
καὶ τὴν κληρονομίαν σου ἐκάκωσαν·
6 χήραν καὶ ὀρφανὸν ἀπέκτειναν,
καὶ προσήλυτον ἐφόνευσαν.
7 Καὶ εἶπαν· οὐκ ὄψεται Κύριος·
οὐδὲ συνήσει ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ Ἰακώβ.
8 Σύνετε [δὴ] ἄφρονες ἐν τῷ λαῷ·
καὶ μωροὶ ποτὲ φρονήσατε;
9 Ὁ φυτεύσας τὸ οὖς, οὐχὶ ἀκούει;
Ὁ πλάσας τὸν ὀφθαλμόν, οὐχὶ κατανοεῖ;

**PSALM XCI.**

8 That they may be utterly destroyed forevermore.
9 But Thou, O Lord, art Most High forever.
10 For behold, Thine enemies, O Lord,
For behold, Thine enemies shall perish;
And all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.
11 And my horn shall be exalted like that of a unicorn,
And my old age with rich oil.
12 And mine eye hath looked upon mine enemies,
And mine ear shall hear of them that rise up against me and work wickedness.
13 The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree:
He shall be multiplied like a cedar in Lebanon.
14 Those that are planted in the house of the Lord
Shall blossom forth in the courts of our God.
15 Yet shall they be multiplied in a rich old age;
And they shall be in good estate:
16 To declare that the Lord my God is upright,
And there is no unrighteousness in Him.

**PSALM XCII.**
A Psalm of a Song by David for the Sabbath Day, when the Earth was Established.

1 The Lord hath reigned; He hath clothed Himself with majesty:
The Lord hath clothed Himself with strength, and girded Himself therewith.
For He hath established the world, that it shall not be moved.
2 Thy throne is prepared from of old:
From everlasting, Thou art.
3 The rivers have lifted up, O Lord,
The rivers have lifted up their voices;
The rivers shall lift up their crashing waves,
From the voices of many waters.
4 Wonderful are the surges of the sea;
Wonderful is the Lord in the high places.
5 Thy testimonies are greatly confirmed:
Holiness becometh Thy house, O Lord, unto length of days.

**PSALM XCIII.**
A Psalm of a Song by David, on the Fourth Day of the Sabbath.

1 O Lord God of vengeance,
O God of vengeance, Thou hast shone forth!
2 Lift up Thyself, O Thou that judgest the earth;
Render a recompense unto the proud.
3 How long, O Lord, shall sinners,
How long shall sinners boast?
4 Shall they utter and speak unrighteousness?
Shall all the workers of iniquity speak [thus]?
5 They have afflicted Thy people, O Lord,
And have wronged Thine inheritance.
6 They have slain the widow and the orphan,
And have murdered the sojourner.
7 And they have said, "The Lord shall not see,
Neither shall the God of Jacob understand."
8 Understand [now], ye foolish among the people;
And ye senseless, when will ye be wise?
9 He that planted the ear, shall He not hear?
He that formed the eye, shall He not perceive?
