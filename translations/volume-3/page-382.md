ΤῊΘ.
8 Καὶ ἀπέστρεψε Κύριος τοῦ διαφθεῖραι τεῖχος θυγατρὸς Σιών·
ἐξέτεινε Κύριος μέτρον, οὐκ ἀπέστρεψε χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ κατα-
πατήματος, καὶ ἐπένθησε τὸ προτείχισμα, καὶ τεῖχος ὁμοθυ-
μαδὸν ἠσθένησαν.

9 Ἐπεπάγησαν εἰς τὴν γῆν αἱ πύλαι αὐτῆς, ἀπώλεσε καὶ συνέ-
τριψε μοχλοὺς αὐτῆς, βασιλέα αὐτῆς, καὶ ἄρχοντας αὐτῆς ἐν
τοῖς ἔθνεσιν· οὐκ ἔστι νόμος, καί γε προφῆται αὐτῆς οὐκ εἶδον
ὅρασιν παρὰ Κυρίου.
Ἰώδ.
10 Ἐκάθισαν εἰς τὴν γῆν, ἐσιώπησαν πρεσβύτεροι θυγατρὸς Σιών,
ἀνεβίβασαν χοῦν ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτῶν, περιεζώσαντο σάκκους,
κατήγαγον εἰς τὴν γῆν ἀρχηγοὺς παρθένους ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ.
Χάφ.
11 Ἐξέλιπον ἐν δάκρυσιν οἱ ὀφθαλμοί μου, ἐταράχθη ἡ καρδία μου,
ἐξεχύθη εἰς γῆν ἡ δόξα μου, ἐπὶ τὸ σύντριμμα τῆς θυγατρὸς τοῦ
λαοῦ μου, ἐν τῷ ἐκλείπειν νήπιον καὶ θηλάζοντα ἐν πλατείαις
πόλεως.
Λάμεδ.
12 Ταῖς μητράσιν αὐτῶν εἶπαν, ποῦ σῖτος καὶ οἶνος, ἐν τῷ ἐκλύε-
σθαι αὐτοὺς ὡς τραυματίας ἐν πλατείαις πόλεως, ἐν τῷ ἐγχέεσθαι
ψυχὰς αὐτῶν εἰς κόλπον μητέρων αὐτῶν.
Μήμ.
13 Τί μαρτυρήσω σοι, ἢ τί ὁμοιώσω σοι, θύγατερ Ἱερουσαλήμ; τίς
σώσει σε καὶ παρακαλέσει σε, παρθένος θύγατερ Σιών; ὅτι ἐμε-
γαλύνθη ποτήριον συντριβῆς σου, τίς ἰάσεταί σε;
Νούν.
14 Προφῆταί σοι εἶδον σοι μάταια καὶ ἀφροσύνην, καὶ οὐκ ἀπεκάλυψαν
ἐπὶ τὴν ἀδικίαν σου, τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι αἰχμαλωσίαν σου, καὶ ἴδο-
σαν σοι λήμματα μάταια καὶ ἐξώσματα.
Σάμεχ.
15 Ἐκρότησαν ἐπὶ σὲ χεῖρας πάντες οἱ παραπορευόμενοι ὁδόν, ἐσύ-
ρισαν, καὶ ἐκίνησαν τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τὴν θυγατέρα Ἱερου-
σαλήμ· ἡ αὕτη ἡ πόλις, ἣν ἐροῦσι, στέφανος δόξης εὐφροσύνης
πάσης τῆς γῆς.

### Chapter II.

**Teth.**
**8** And the Lord hath turned [to] destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion. The Lord hath stretched out a line; He hath not withdrawn His hand from the trampling. And the rampart hath mourned, and the wall, together they have been weakened.

**9** Her gates have sunk into the ground; He hath destroyed and broken her bars, her king, and her princes among the nations. There is no law, and even her prophets have not seen a vision from the Lord.

**Yod.**
**10** They have sat upon the ground, the elders of the daughter of Zion have been silent. They have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloth. They have brought down to the ground the leading maidens in Jerusalem.

**Kaph.**
**11** My eyes have failed with tears; my heart is troubled. My glory hath been poured out upon the ground, because of the crushing of the daughter of my people, when the infant and the suckling do fail in the streets of the city.

**Lamedh.**
**12** They have said to their mothers, "Where is corn and wine?" when they fainted as wounded men in the streets of the city, when their souls were poured out into the bosoms of their mothers.

**Mem.**
**13** What shall I testify unto you, or to what shall I liken you, O daughter of Jerusalem? Who shall save you and comfort you, O virgin daughter of Zion? For the cup of your breaking hath been greatly enlarged; who shall heal you?

**Nun.**
**14** Your prophets have seen for you for you vain things and foolishness, and they have not revealed concerning your iniquity, so that they might turn back your captivity. And they have seen for you vain burdens and banishments.

**Samekh.**
**15** All who pass by the way have clapped their hands at you. They have hissed and shaken their heads at the daughter of Jerusalem. Is this that city, of which they shall say, "A crown of glory, the joy of all the earth"?
