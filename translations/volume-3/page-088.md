**ΨΑΛΜ. ΡΙΒ΄. CXII.**

1 ἈΛΛΗΛΟΥΪΑ. Αἰνεῖτε παῖδες τὸν Κύριον, αἰνεῖτε τὸ ὄνομα
2 Κυρίου. Εἴη τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου εὐλογημένον, ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν καὶ ἕως
3 τοῦ αἰῶνος· ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν ἡλίου (καὶ) μέχρι δυσμῶν αἰνετὸν τὸ
4 ὄνομα Κυρίου. Ὑψηλὸς ἐπὶ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη ὁ Κύριος· ἐπὶ τοὺς οὐ-
5 ρανοὺς ἡ δόξα αὐτοῦ. Τίς ὡς Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν; Ὁ ἐν ὑψη-
6 λοῖς κατοικῶν, καὶ τὰ ταπεινὰ ἐφορῶν ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ καὶ ἐν τῇ
7 γῇ. Ὁ ἐγείρων ἀπὸ γῆς πτωχόν, καὶ ἀπὸ κοπρίας ἀνυψῶν πένη-
8 τα· τοῦ καθίσαι αὐτὸν μετὰ ἀρχόντων, μετὰ ἀρχόντων λαοῦ αὐ-
9 τοῦ. Ὁ κατοικίζων στεῖραν ἐν οἴκῳ, μητέρα ἐπὶ τέκνοις εὐφραι-
               νομένων.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ΡΙΓ΄. CXIII.**

1 ἈΛΛΗΛΟΥΪΑ. Ἐν ἐξόδῳ Ἰσραὴλ ἐξ Αἰγύπτου, οἴκου Ἰα-
2 κὼβ ἐκ λαοῦ βαρβάρου, ἐγενήθη Ἰουδαία ἁγίασμα αὐτοῦ, Ἰσραὴλ
3 ἐξουσία αὐτοῦ. Ἡ θάλασσα εἶδε καὶ ἔφυγεν, ὁ Ἰορδάνης ἐστράφη
4 εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω· τὰ ὄρη ἐσκιρτήσαν ὡσεὶ κριοί, καὶ οἱ βουνοὶ ὡς ἀρ-
5 νία προβάτων. Τί σοι ἐστὶ θάλασσα ὅτι ἔφυγες, καὶ σοὶ Ἰορδά-
6 νη ὅτι ἐστράφης εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω; Τὰ ὄρη ὅτι ἐσκιρτήσατε ὡσεὶ κριοί,
7 καὶ οἱ βουνοὶ ὡς ἀρνία προβάτων; Ἀπὸ προσώπου Κυρίου ἐσα-
8 λεύθη ἡ γῆ, ἀπὸ προσώπου τοῦ Θεοῦ Ἰακώβ· τοῦ στρέψαντος τὴν
              πέτραν εἰς λίμνας ὑδάτων, καὶ τὴν ἀκρότομον εἰς πηγὰς ὑδάτων.
9 Μὴ ἡμῖν Κύριε, μὴ ἡμῖν, ἀλλ᾿ ἢ τῷ ὀνόματί σου δὸς δόξαν ἐπὶ
10 τῷ ἐλέει σου καὶ τῇ ἀληθείᾳ σου· μή ποτε εἴπωσι τὰ ἔθνη· ποῦ
11 ἐστιν ὁ Θεὸς αὐτῶν; Ὁ δὲ Θεὸς ἡμῶν ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ (καὶ ἐν τῇ
12 γῇ)· πάντα ὅσα ἠθέλησεν ἐποίησε. Τὰ εἴδωλα τῶν ἐθνῶν ἀργύριον
13 καὶ χρυσίον, ἔργα χειρῶν ἀνθρώπων· στόμα ἔχουσι, καὶ οὐ λαλή-
14 σουσιν· ὀφθαλμοὺς ἔχουσι, καὶ οὐκ ὄψονται· ὦτα ἔχουσι, καὶ οὐκ
15 ἀκούσονται· ῥῖνας ἔχουσι, καὶ οὐκ ὀσφρανθήσονται· χεῖρας ἔχου-
              σι, καὶ οὐ ψηλαφήσουσι· πόδας ἔχουσι, καὶ οὐ περιπατήσουσιν· οὐ
16 φωνήσουσιν ἐν τῷ λάρυγγι αὐτῶν. Ὅμοιοι αὐτῶν γένοιντο οἱ
17 ποιοῦντες αὐτά, καὶ πάντες οἱ πεποιθότες ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῖς. Οἶκος Ἰσ-
              ραὴλ ἤλπισεν ἐπὶ Κύριον· βοηθὸς αὐτῶν καὶ ὑπερασπιστὴς αὐτῶν
              .

**PSALM CXII.**

**ALLELUIA.**
1 Praise the Lord, ye children;
    praise the Name of the Lord.
2 Blessed be the Name of the Lord,
    from this time forth and even unto the age.
3 From the rising of the sun, and unto the going down of the same,
    praised be the Name of the Lord.
4 High above all nations is the Lord;
    His glory is above the heavens.
5 Who is as the Lord our God?
    He that dwelleth on high,
6 and looketh down upon the humble things
    in heaven and on earth.
7 He that raiseth up the poor man from the earth,
    and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill;
8 to seat him with princes,
    with the princes of His people.
9 He that maketh the barren woman to dwell in her house,
    a joyful mother of children.

**PSALM CXIII.**

**ALLELUIA.**
1 When Israel went out of Egypt,
    the house of Jacob from a people of strange tongue,
2 Judah became His sanctuary,
    and Israel His dominion.
3 The sea saw it and fled;
    the Jordan turned back again.
4 The mountains skipped like rams,
    and the hills as the lambs of sheep.
5 What aileth thee, O sea, that thou fleddest?
    and thou, O Jordan, that thou turnedst back again?
6 Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams?
    and ye hills, as the lambs of sheep?
7 At the presence of the Lord the earth was shaken,
    at the presence of the God of Jacob,
8 Who turned the rock into pools of waters,
    and the flinty rock into fountains of waters.
9 Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us,
    but unto Thy Name give glory,
    for Thy mercy and for Thy truth.
10 Lest at any time the nations should say,
    "Where is their God?"
11 But our God is in heaven (and on earth);
    whatsoever He hath willed, that hath He done.
12 The idols of the nations are silver and gold,
    the works of the hands of men.
13 They have a mouth, and they shall not speak;
    they have eyes, and they shall not see;
14 they have ears, and they shall not hear;
    they have noses, and they shall not smell;
15 they have hands, and they shall not feel;
    they have feet, and they shall not walk;
    neither shall they cry aloud with their throat.
16 May they that make them become like unto them,
    and all that trust in them.
17 The house of Israel hath hoped in the Lord;
    He is their Helper and their Defender.
