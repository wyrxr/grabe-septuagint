ΚΕΦ. Α´.
14 ἀνέβησαν ἐπὶ τὸν τράχηλόν μου, ἠσθένησεν ἡ ἰσχύς μου, ὅτι
ἔδωκε Κύριος ἐν χερσί μου ὀδύνας, οὐ δυνήσομαι στῆναι.
Σάμεχ.
15 Ἔξῆρε πάντας τοὺς ἰσχυρούς μου ὁ Κύριος ἐκ μέσου μου, ἐ-
κάλεσεν ἐπ᾿ ἐμὲ καιρὸν τοῦ συντρίψαι ἐκλεκτούς μου· ληνὸν ἐπά-
τησε Κύριος παρθένῳ θυγατρὶ Ἰούδα, ἐπὶ τούτοις ἐγὼ κλαίω.
Ἂϊν.
16 Ὁ ὀφθαλμός μου κατήγαγεν ὕδωρ, ὅτι ἐμακρύνθη ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ ὁ
παρακαλῶν με, ὁ ἐπιστρέφων ψυχήν μου· ἐγένοντο οἱ υἱοί μου
ἠφανισμένοι, ὅτι ἐκραταιώθη ὁ ἐχθρός.
Φή.
17 Διεπέτασε Σιὼν τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῆς, οὐκ ἔστιν ὁ παρακαλῶν
αὐτήν· ἐνετείλατο Κύριος τῷ Ἰακώβ, κύκλῳ αὐτοῦ οἱ θλίβον-
τες· αὐτὸν ἐγενήθη Ἱερουσαλὴμ εἰς ἀποκαθημένην ἀναμέσον
αὐτῶν.
Τσαδή.
18 Δίκαιός ἐστι Κύριος, ὅτι τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ παρεπίκρανεν· ἀκού-
σατε᾿ δὴ πάντες οἱ λαοί, καὶ ἴδετε τὸ ἄλγος μου· παρθένοι
μου καὶ νεανίσκοι μου ἐπορεύθησαν ἐν αἰχμαλωσίᾳ.
Κώφ.
19 Ἐκάλεσα τοὺς ἐραστάς μου, αὐτοὶ δὲ παρελογίσαντό με· οἱ
ἱερεῖς μου καὶ οἱ πρεσβύτεροί μου ἐν τῇ πόλει ἐξέλιπον, ὅτι ἐ-
ζήτησαν βρῶσιν αὐτοῖς, ἵνα ἐπιστρέψωσι ψυχὰς αὐτῶν, καὶ οὐχ
εὗρον.
Ῥήχς.
20 Ἴδε Κύριε, ὅτι θλίβομαι, καὶ ἡ κοιλία μου ἐταράχθη, καὶ ἡ
καρδία μου ἐστράφη ἐν ἐμοί, ὅτι παραπικραίνουσα παρεπικράν-
θην, ἔξωθεν ἠτέκνωσέ με μάχαιρα ὥσπερ θάνατος ἐν οἴκῳ.
Χσέν.
21 Ἀκούσατε δὴ, ὅτι στενάζω ἐγώ, οὐκ ἔστιν ὁ παρακαλῶν με·
πάντες οἱ ἐχθροί μου ἤκουσαν τὰ κακά μου, καὶ ἐχάρησαν, ὅτι
σὺ ἐποίησας, ἐπήγαγες ἡμέραν, ἐκάλεσας καιρόν, καὶ ἐγένοντο
ὅμοιοι ἐμοί.
Θαῦ.
22 Εἰσέλθοι πᾶσα ἡ κακία αὐτῶν κατὰ πρόσωπόν σου, καὶ ἐπιφύλ-
λιττον αὐτοῖς, ὃν τρόπον ἐποίησαν ἐπιφυλλίδα περὶ πάντων τῶν
