ΚΕΦ. Θʹ.
20 Ἐκδότω τὰ ὦτα ὑμῶν λόγους στόματος αὐτοῦ, καὶ διδάξατε τὰς
 θυγατέρας ὑμῶν θρῆνον, καὶ γυνὴ τὴν πλησίον ἑαυτῆς θρῆνον·
21 Ὅτι ἀνέβη θάνατος διὰ τῶν θυρίδων ὑμῶν, καὶ ἦλθεν εἰς τὴν
 γῆν ὑμῶν, τοῦ ἐκτρῖψαι νήπια ἔξωθεν, καὶ νεανίσκους ἀπὸ τῶν
22 πλατειῶν θανάτῳ. Τάδε λέγει Κύριος· καὶ ἔσονται οἱ νεκροὶ τῶν
 ἀνθρώπων εἰς παράδειγμα ἐπὶ προσώπου τοῦ πεδίου τῆς γῆς ὑ-
 μῶν, καὶ ὡς χόρτος ὀπίσω θερίζοντος, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ὁ συνάγων.
23 Τάδε λέγει Κύριος· μὴ καυχάσθω ὁ σοφὸς ἐν τῇ σοφίᾳ αὐτοῦ,
 καὶ μὴ καυχάσθω ὁ ἰσχυρὸς ἐν τῇ ἰσχύϊ αὐτοῦ, καὶ μὴ καυχάσθω
24 ὁ πλούσιος ἐν τῷ πλούτῳ αὐτοῦ, ἀλλ᾿ ἐν τούτῳ καυχάσθω ὁ
 καυχώμενος, συνιεῖν καὶ γινώσκειν, ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι Κύριος ὁ ποιῶν
 ἔλεος καὶ κρῖμα καὶ δικαιοσύνην ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, ὅτι ἐν τούτοις τὸ
25 θέλημά μου, λέγει Κύριος. Ἰδοὺ ἡμέραι ἔρχονται, λέγει Κύριος,
 καὶ ἐπισκέψομαι ἐπὶ πάντας περιτετμημένους ἀκροβυστίας αὐτῶν·
26 ἐπ᾿ Αἴγυπτον, καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν Ἰδουμαίαν, καὶ ἐπὶ Ἐδώμ, καὶ ἐπὶ πάν-
 τας τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἀμμῶν, καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς Μωάβ, καὶ ἐπὶ πᾶν
 περικειρόμενον τὰ κατὰ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ, τοὺς κατοικοῦντας ἐν
 τῇ ἐρήμῳ, ὅτι πάντα τὰ ἔθνη ἀπερίτμητα σαρκί, καὶ πᾶς οἶκος
 Ἰσραὴλ ἀπερίτμητοι καρδίας αὐτῶν.

ΚΕΦ. Ιʹ.
1 ΑΚΟΥΣΑΤΕ τὸν λόγον Κυρίου, ὃν ἐλάλησε Κύριος ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς,
 οἶκος Ἰσραήλ.
2 Τάδε λέγει Κύριος· κατὰ τὰς ὁδοὺς ἐθνῶν μὴ μανθάνετε, καὶ ἀπὸ
 τῶν σημείων τοῦ οὐρανοῦ μὴ φοβεῖσθε, ὅτι φοβοῦνται αὐτὰ τοῖς
 προσώποις αὐτῶν.
3 Ὅτι τὰ νόμιμα τῶν ἐθνῶν μάταια, ξύλον ἐστὶν ἐκ τοῦ δρυμοῦ
 ἐκκεκομμένον, ἔργον τέκτονος,
4 καὶ χώνευμα, ἀργυρίῳ καὶ χρυσίῳ κεκαλλωπισμένα ἐστὶν ἐν σφύ-
 ραις, καὶ ἥλοις ἐστερέωσαν αὐτά, καὶ οὐ κινηθήσονται.
5 Ἀρθήσονται, ὅτι οὐκ ἐπιβήσονται· μὴ φοβηθῆτε αὐτά, ὅτι οὐ κα-
 κοποιήσουσι, καὶ ἀγαθὸν οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν αὐτοῖς.
6 Τίς ὅμοιός σοι Κύριε; μέγας εἶ σύ, καὶ μέγα τὸ ὄνομά σου ἐν
 δυνάμει.
7 Τίς οὐ φοβηθήσεταί σε, βασιλεῦ τῶν ἐθνῶν; ὅτι σὺ ἐπέπρεψας
 προσκυνῆσαι, ὅτι ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς σοφοῖς τῶν ἐθνῶν καὶ ἐν πάσαις
 ταῖς βασιλείαις αὐτῶν ὅμοιός σοι, Κύριε;
8 Καὶ εἰσάπαξ ἀσυνετισθήσονται καὶ ἀνοητισθήσονται, καὶ παιδεία
 ματαιοτήτων ἐν αὐτοῖς ξύλον ἐστίν.
9 Ἀργύριον πορευτόν ἐστιν, οὐ πορεύσονται· προσβλητὸν ἀπὸ Θαρσὶς
 ἥξει χρυσίον Μωρὰζ, καὶ χεῖρες χρυσοχόων, ἔργα τεχνιτῶν πάντα·
 ὑάκινθον καὶ πορφύραν ἐνδύσουσιν αὐτὰ ἔργα σοφῶν ἅπαντα αὐτοῖς.

CHAPTER IX.

**20** ...Let your ears receive the words of His mouth, and teach your daughters a lamentation, and [let] every woman [teach] her neighbor a lamentation.
**21** For death hath come up through your windows, and is entered into your land, to cut off the infants from without, and the young men from the streets by death.
**22** Thus saith the Lord: And the dead bodies of men shall be for a spectacle upon the face of the field of your land, and as grass after the reaper, and there shall be none to gather [them].
**23** Thus saith the Lord: Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man boast in his might, neither let
**24** the rich man boast in his riches; but let him that boasteth boast in this, that he understandeth and knoweth that I am the Lord who executeth mercy, and judgment, and righteousness upon the earth; for in these things is My will, saith the Lord.
**25** Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will visit all those circumcised in their foreskins:
**26** upon Egypt, and upon Idumaea, and upon Edom, and upon all the sons of Ammon, and upon the sons of Moab, and upon all who cut off the hair of their faces, them that dwell in the wilderness; for all the nations are uncircumcised in their flesh, but all the house of Israel are uncircumcised of their heart.

CHAPTER X.

**1** Hear ye the word of the Lord, which the Lord hath spoken concerning you, O house of Israel.
**2** Thus saith the Lord: Learn not according to the ways of the nations, and be not afraid of the signs of heaven; for they fear them in their countenances.
**3** For the customs of the nations are vain; for it is a tree cut out of the forest, the work of a carpenter,
**4** and a molten image. It is adorned with silver and gold by means of hammers; and with nails they have fastened them, so that they shall not be moved.
**5** They shall be borne, for they shall not go forth [of themselves]. Be ye not afraid of them, for they shall not do evil, neither is there any good in them.
**6** Who is like unto Thee, O Lord? Thou art great, and great is Thy name in might.
**7** Who shall not fear Thee, O King of the nations? For Thou hast permitted [them] to worship, because among all the wise of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, who is like unto Thee, O Lord?
**8** And at once shall they be made senseless and foolish, and the instruction of vanities in them is wood.
**9** Silver is portable; they shall not go forth. Overlaid silver shall come from Tarshish, [and] gold from Moraz, and the hands of goldsmiths; all are works of craftsmen. They shall clothe them in hyacinth and purple; all these are the works of cunning men.
