γῆς ὀδυνηρᾶς ἰατρεύσω σε, φησὶ Κύριος· ὅτι ἐσπαρμένη ἐκλήθης,
θήρευμα ὑμῶν ἐστιν, ὅτι ζητῶν οὐκ ἔστιν αὐτήν. Οὕτως εἶπε 18
Κύριος· Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἀποστρέφω τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν σκηνωμάτων Ἰα-
κώβ, καὶ τὴν ἀποικίαν αὐτοῦ ἐλεήσω καὶ οἰκοδομηθήσεται πό-
λις ἐπὶ ὕψος αὐτῆς, καὶ ὁ λαὸς κατὰ τὸ κρῖμα αὐτοῦ καθεδεῖ-
ται, καὶ ἐξελεύσονται ἀπ᾽ αὐτῶν ἄδοντες καὶ φωνὴ παιζόντων· 19
καὶ πλεονάσω αὐτούς, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἐλαττωθῶσι, καὶ ἐκχεῶ αὐτούς,
καὶ οὐ μὴ σμικρυνθῶσι· καὶ εἰσελεύσονται οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ ὡς τὸ 20
πρότερον, καὶ τὰ μαρτύρια αὐτῶν ὡς τὸ ἀπ᾽ ἀρχῆς κατὰ πρό-
σωπόν μου ὀρθωθήσεται· καὶ ἐπισκέψομαι ἐπὶ πάντας τοὺς θλί-
βοντας αὐτούς, καὶ ἔσονται ἰσχυρότεροι αὐτοῦ ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς καὶ ὁ 21
ἄρχων αὐτοῦ ἐξ αὐτοῦ ἐξελεύσεται· καὶ συνάξω αὐτούς, καὶ ἀπο-
στρέψουσι πρὸς μέ, ὅτι τίς ἐστιν οὗτος, ὃς ἔδωκε τὴν καρδίαν αὐ-
τοῦ, ἐπιστρέψαι πρὸς μέ, φησὶ Κύριος; Καὶ ἔσεσθέ μοι εἰς λαόν, 22
καὶ ἐγὼ ἔσομαι ὑμῖν εἰς Θεόν. Ὅτι ὀργὴ Κυρίου ἐξῆλθε θυμώ- 23
δης, ἐξῆλθεν ὀργὴ στρεφομένη, ἐπ᾽ ἀσεβεῖς ἥξει. Οὐ μὴ ἀποστρα- 24
φῇ ὀργὴ θυμοῦ Κυρίου, ἕως ποιήσῃ, καὶ ἕως καταστήσῃ ἐγχεί-
ρημα καρδίας αὐτοῦ· ἐπ᾽ ἐσχάτου τῶν ἡμερῶν γνώσεσθε αὐτά.

Ἐν τῷ χρόνῳ ἐκείνῳ, εἶπε Κύριος· καὶ ἔσομαι εἰς Θεὸν τῷ 1
γένει Ἰσραήλ, καὶ αὐτοὶ ἔσονταί μοι εἰς λαόν. Οὕτως εἶπε Κύ- 2
ριος· εὗρον θερμὸν ἐν ἐρήμῳ μετὰ ὀλωλότων ἐν μαχαίρᾳ βαδί-
σατε, καὶ μὴ ὀλέσητε τὸν Ἰσραήλ, Κύριος πόρρωθεν ὤφθη αὐτῷ· 3
ἀγάπησιν αἰωνίαν ἠγάπησά σε· διὰ τοῦτο εἵλκυσά σε εἰς οἰκτεί-
ρημα. Ἔτι οἰκοδομήσω σε, καὶ οἰκοδομηθήσῃ, παρθένος Ἰσραήλ· 4
ἔτι λήψῃ τύμπανόν σου, καὶ ἐξελεύσῃ μετὰ συναγωγῆς παιζόντων.
Ἔτι φυτεύσατε ἀμπελῶνας ἐν ὄρεσι Σαμαρείας, φύσαντες φυτεύ- 5
σατε, καὶ αἰνέσατε, ὅτι ἐστιν ἡμέρα κλήσεως ἀπολογουμένων ἐν 6
ὄρεσιν Ἐφραΐμ· ἀνάστητε, καὶ ἀνάβητε εἰς Σιὼν πρὸς Κύριον τὸν
Θεὸν ἡμῶν, ὅτι οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος τῷ Ἰακώβ· ἀγαλλιᾶσθε καὶ 7
εὐφράνθητε, καὶ χρεμετίσατε ἐπὶ κεφαλὴν ἐθνῶν· ἀκουστὰ ποι-
ήσατε, καὶ αἰνέσατε· εἴπατε, ἔσωσε Κύριος τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ, τὸ
κατάλοιπον τοῦ Ἰσραήλ. Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἄγω αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ γῆς βορρᾶ, 8
καὶ συνάξω αὐτοὺς ἀπ᾽ ἐσχάτου τῆς γῆς ἐν ἑορτῇ Φασέκ· καὶ

**JEREMIAH CHAPTER 37 [LXX] (Hebrew Chapter 30)**

**17** ...from a grievous land will I heal thee, saith the Lord; for thou wast called the scattered one; a prey are ye accounted, for none doth seek her.
**18** Thus saith the Lord: "Behold, I shall turn back the captivity of the tents of Jacob, and his [place of] exile will I pity; and the city shall be built upon her own height, and the people shall sit according to his judgment.
**19** And from them shall go forth those who sing, and the voice of those who make merry; and I shall multiply them, and they shall not be diminished; and I shall spread them abroad, and they shall not be made small.
**20** And his sons shall come in as formerly, and their testimonies, as from the beginning, shall be established before My face. And I shall look upon all them that afflict them;
**21** and his stronger ones shall be against them, and his ruler shall come forth from him. And I shall gather them, and they shall return unto Me; for who is this that hath given his heart to return unto Me?" saith the Lord.
**22** "And ye shall be My people, and I shall be your God."
**23** For the wrath of the Lord hath gone forth, a tempestuous [wrath]; a whirling wrath hath gone forth, upon the ungodly shall it come.
**24** The wrath of the Lord's anger shall not turn back, until He hath done, and until He hath established the purpose of His heart. In the end of the days shall ye know them.

**JEREMIAH CHAPTER 38 [LXX] (Hebrew Chapter 31)**

**1** At that time, saith the Lord, "I shall be God to the house of Israel, and they shall be My people."
**2** Thus saith the Lord: "I found a warmth in the wilderness, among those slain by the sword; go ye, and destroy not Israel."
**3** The Lord appeared unto him from afar, [saying]: "With an everlasting love have I loved thee; therefore have I drawn thee to have compassion.
**4** Again will I build thee, and thou shalt be built, O Virgin Israel; again shalt thou take thy timbrel, and shalt go forth with the company of them that make merry.
**5** Again shall ye plant vineyards upon the mountains of Samaria; with planting shall ye plant, and praise ye,
**6** for there is a day of calling for those who make their defense upon the mountains of Ephraim. Arise ye, and go up to Zion unto the Lord our God."
**7** For thus saith the Lord to Jacob: "Rejoice ye and be glad, and neigh upon the head of the nations; make it heard, and praise ye; say ye, 'The Lord hath saved His people, the remnant of Israel.'
**8** Behold, I lead them from the land of the north, and I shall gather them from the ends of the earth in the feast of Phasek; and"
