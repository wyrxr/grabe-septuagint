Ἤκουσα τῆς φωνῆς μου. Πάντας τοὺς ποιμένας σου ποιμανεῖ 22
ἄνεμος, καὶ οἱ ἐρασταί σου ἐν αἰχμαλωσίᾳ ἐξελεύσονται, ὅτι τότε
αἰσχυνθήσῃ καὶ ἀτιμασθήσῃ ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν φιλούντων σε. Κα- 23
τοικοῦσα ἐν τῷ Λιβάνῳ, ἐννοσσεύουσα ἐν ταῖς κέδροις, ὅτι κατα-
στενάξεις ἐν τῷ ἐλθεῖν σοι ὀδύνας, ὠδίνας ὡς τικτούσης· Ζῶ ἐγὼ, λέ- 24
γει Κύριος, ἐὰν γενόμενος γένηται Ἰεχονίας υἱὸς Ἰωακεὶμ βασιλεὺς
Ἰούδα, ἀποσφράγισμα ἐπὶ τῆς χειρὸς τῆς δεξιᾶς μου, ὅτι ἐκεῖθεν ἐκ-
σπάσω σε, καὶ παραδώσω σε εἰς χεῖρας τῶν ζητούντων τὴν ψυχήν 25
σου, καὶ εἰς χεῖρας ὧν σὺ εὐλαβῇ ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτῶν, εἰς χεῖ-
ρας Ναβουχοδονόσορ βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος, καὶ ἐν χειρὶ τῶν Χαλ-
δαίων, καὶ ἀποῤῥίψω σε καὶ τὴν μητέρα σου τὴν τεκοῦσάν σε εἰς 26
γῆν, οὗ οὐκ ἐτέχθης ἐκεῖ, καὶ ἐκεῖ ἀποθανεῖσθε. Εἰς δὲ τὴν γῆν, ἣν 27
αὐτοὶ εὔχονται ταῖς ψυχαῖς αὐτῶν τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι ἐκεῖ, ἐκεῖ
οὐ μὴ ἐπιστρέψουσιν. Τὸ σῶμα τὸ ἐξουδενωμένον καὶ ἐκτετιναγ- 28
μένον ἀνὴρ οὗτος· ἠτιμώθη Ἰεχονίας ὡς σκεῦος, οὗ οὐκ ἔστι
χρεία αὐτοῦ, ὅτι ἐξεῤῥίφη αὐτὸς καὶ τὸ σπέρμα αὐτοῦ, καὶ
ἐξεβλήθη εἰς γῆν, ἣν οὐχ ᾔδει. Γῆ, γῆ, ἄκουε λόγον Κυρίου. 29
Τάδε λέγει Κύριος· γράψον τὸν ἄνδρα τοῦτον ἐκκήρυκτον ἄνθρω- 30
πον, ἀνεύοδωτον ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις αὐτοῦ· ὅτι οὐ μὴ αὐξηθῇ ἐκ
τοῦ σπέρματος αὐτοῦ ἀνὴρ καθήμενος ἐπὶ θρόνου Δαυίδ, ἄρχων
ἔτι ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ Ἰούδα.

 Ὦ Οἱ ποιμένες οἱ διασκορπίζοντες καὶ ἀπολλύοντες τὰ πρό- 1
βατα τῆς νομῆς μου, φησὶ Κύριος. Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Κύριος 2
ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραὴλ ἐπὶ τοὺς ποιμένας τοὺς ποιμέναντας τὸν λαόν
μου· ὑμεῖς διεσκορπίσατε τὰ πρόβατά μου, καὶ ἀπώσατε αὐτὰ,
καὶ οὐκ ἐπεσκέψασθε αὐτὰ, ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐκδικήσω ἐφ᾽ ὑμᾶς κατὰ τὰ
πονηρὰ ἐπιτηδεύματα ὑμῶν, φησὶ Κύριος. Κἀγὼ εἰσδέξομαι τὸ 3
κατάλοιπον τοῦ λαοῦ μου ἀπὸ πάσης τῆς γῆς, οὗ ἔξωσα αὐ-
τοὺς ἐκεῖ, καὶ καταστήσω αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν νομὴν αὐτῶν, καὶ αὐ-
ξηθήσονται, καὶ πληθυνθήσονται. Καὶ ἀναστήσω αὐτοῖς ποιμέ- 4
νας, καὶ ποιμανοῦσιν αὐτοὺς, καὶ οὐ φοβηθήσονται ἔτι, καὶ οὐ
πτοηθήσονται ἔτι, οὐδὲ διαφωνήσουσι, λέγει Κύριος. Ἰδοὺ ἡμέ- 5

### JEREMIAH 22

**22** My voice hath been heard. All thy shepherds shall the wind scatter, and thy lovers shall go forth into captivity; for then shalt thou be shamed and dishonoured by all them that loved thee.
**23** O thou that dwellest in Lebanon, and makest thy nest in the cedars, surely thou shalt groan when pangs come upon thee, even sorrows as of a woman in travail.
**24** As I live, saith the Lord, though Jeconiah, the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, were [even as] a signet ring upon My right hand, yet thence will I surely pluck thee off.
**25** And I will deliver thee into the hands of them that seek thy life, and into the hands of them whose countenances thou dost fear; even into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.
**26** And I will cast thee forth, and thy mother that bore thee, into a land where ye were not born, and there shall ye both die.
**27** But to the land whereunto their souls do long to return, thither shall they not return.
**28** This man is a body despised and cast forth; Jeconiah was dishonoured as a vessel in which there is no pleasure, for he himself was cast out and his seed, and was thrust forth into a land which he knew not.
**29** O Earth, O Earth, hear ye the word of the Lord.
**30** Thus saith the Lord: 'Write ye this man [down as] one proscribed, a man who shall not prosper in his days; for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, [or] ruling anymore in the house of Judah.'

### JEREMIAH 23

**1** Woe unto those shepherds that do scatter and destroy the sheep of My pasture, saith the Lord.
**2** Therefore thus saith the Lord God of Israel concerning the shepherds who have shepherded My people: 'Ye have scattered My sheep, and have driven them away, and have not cared for them; behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your doings,' saith the Lord.
**3** And I will gather the remnant of My people from all the lands where I have scattered them, and I will restore them to their pasture, and they shall be fruitful and shall multiply.
**4** And I will raise up shepherds over them, and they shall feed them; and they shall fear no more, nor be terrified anymore, neither shall they be scattered, saith the Lord.
**5** Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise up unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and shall understand, and shall execute judgment and righteousness upon the earth.
