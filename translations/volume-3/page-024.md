ΨΑΛΤΗΡΙΟΝ.

27 Ἀγαλλιάσοιντο καὶ εὐφρανθείησαν (ἐπὶ σοὶ) οἱ θέλοντες τὴν δικαιοσύνην μου˙
28 καὶ εἰπάτωσαν διαπαντὸς, μεγαλυνθήτω ὁ Κύριος,
29 οἱ θέλοντες τὴν εἰρήνην τοῦ δούλου αὐτοῦ.
30 Καὶ ἡ γλῶσσά μου μελετήσει τὴν δικαιοσύνην σου, ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν τὸν ἔπαινόν σου.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ΛΕʹ. XXXV.**
1.2 **Εἰς** τὸ τέλος τῷ δούλῳ Κυρίου τῷ Δαυίδ (ψαλμός).
3 Φησὶν ὁ παράνομος τοῦ ἁμαρτάνειν ἐν ἑαυτῷ˙
   οὐκ ἔστι φόβος Θεοῦ ἀπέναντι τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν αὐτοῦ.
4 Ὅτι ἐδόλωσεν ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ,
5 τοῦ εὑρεῖν τὴν ἀνομίαν αὐτοῦ καὶ μισῆσαι.
   Τὰ ῥήματα τοῦ στόματος αὐτοῦ ἀνομία καὶ δόλος˙
6 οὐκ ἠβουλήθη συνιέναι τοῦ ἀγαθῦναι.
7 Ἀνομίαν διελογίσατο ἐπὶ τῆς κοίτης αὐτοῦ˙
   παρέστη πάσῃ ὁδῷ οὐκ ἀγαθῇ,
8 κακία δὲ οὐ προσώχθισε.
   Κύριε ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ τὸ ἔλεός σου,
9 καὶ ἡ ἀλήθειά σου ἕως τῶν νεφελῶν˙
   ἡ δικαιοσύνη σου ὡς ὄρη Θεοῦ,
10 τὰ κρίματά σου ἄβυσσος πολλή˙
   ἀνθρώπους καὶ κτήνη σώσεις
11 Κύριε. Ὡς ἐπλήθυνας τὸ ἔλεός σου ὁ Θεός˙
   οἱ δὲ (οἱ) υἱοὶ τῶν ἀνθρώπων ἐν σκέπῃ τῶν πτερύγων σου ἐλπιοῦσι˙
12 μεθυσθήσονται ἀπὸ πιότητος οἴκου σου,
13 καὶ τὸν χειμάρρουν τῆς τρυφῆς σου ποτιεῖς αὐτούς.
14 Ὅτι παρὰ σοὶ πηγὴ ζωῆς˙
   ἐν τῷ φωτί σου ὀψόμεθα φῶς.
15 Παράτεινον τὸ ἔλεός σου τοῖς γινώσκουσί σε,
16 καὶ τὴν δικαιοσύνην σου τοῖς εὐθέσι τῇ καρδίᾳ.
   Μὴ ἐλθάτω μοι πούς ὑπερηφανίας,
17 καὶ χεὶρ ἁμαρτωλοῦ μὴ σαλεύσαι με˙
18 Ἐκεῖ ἔπεσαν (πάντες) οἱ ἐργαζόμενοι τὴν ἀνομίαν˙
   ἐξώσθησαν, καὶ οὐ μὴ δύνωνται στῆναι.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ΛΣʹ. XXXVI.**
1 **(Εἰς** τὸ τέλος Ψαλμὸς) τῷ Δαυίδ.
   Μὴ παραζήλου ἐν πονηρευομένοις,
2 μηδὲ ζήλου τοὺς ποιοῦντας τὴν ἀνομίαν˙
3 Ὅτι ὡσεὶ χόρτος ταχὺ ἀποξηρανθήσονται,
   καὶ ὡσεὶ λάχανα χλόης ταχὺ ἀποπεσοῦνται.
4 Ἔλπισον ἐπὶ Κύριον, καὶ ποίει χρηστότητα,
5 καὶ κατασκήνου τὴν γῆν, καὶ ποιμανθήσῃ ἐπὶ τῷ πλούτῳ αὐτῆς.
6 Κατατρύφησον τοῦ Κυρίου,
   καὶ δώσει σοι τὰ αἰτήματα τῆς καρδίας σου.
7 Ἀποκάλυψον πρὸς Κύριον τὴν ὁδόν σου,
   καὶ ἔλπισον ἐπ᾿ αὐτόν,
8 καὶ αὐτὸς ποιήσει˙ καὶ ἐξοίσει ὡς φῶς τὴν δικαιοσύνην σου,

**PSALM XXXIV.**

27 Let them rejoice and be glad (in Thee), they that desire my righteousness;
And let them say continually, "The Lord be magnified,"
They that desire the peace of His servant.
28 And my tongue shall meditate upon Thy righteousness,
All the day long Thy praise.

**PSALM XXXV.**

1 For the End, to the servant of the Lord, to David (a Psalm).
2 The transgressor declareth in his heart to commit transgression;
There is no fear of God before his eyes.
3 For he hath dealt deceitfully within his own sight,
4 To discover his iniquity and to hate [it].
The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit;
5 He would not understand to do good.
6 He devised iniquity upon his bed;
He set himself upon every way that is not good,
And evil did not displease him.
7 O Lord, Thy mercy is in the heavens,
And Thy truth [reaches] unto the clouds;
8 Thy righteousness is as the mountains of God,
Thy judgments are a great deep;
Thou wilt save men and beasts, O Lord.
9 How greatly hast Thou multiplied Thy mercy, O God!
But the (the) sons of men shall hope in the shelter of Thy wings.
10 They shall be made drunk from the fatness of Thy house,
And Thou shalt make them drink of the torrent of Thy delights.
11 For with Thee is the fountain of life;
In Thy light shall we see light.
12 Extend Thy mercy unto them that know Thee,
And Thy righteousness to the upright in heart.
13 Let not the foot of pride come unto me,
And let not the hand of a sinner move me.
14 There fell (all) they that work iniquity;
They were cast out, and they shall not be able to stand.

**PSALM XXXVI.**

1 (For the End, a Psalm) to David.
Fret not thyself because of evildoers,
Neither be envious of those who work iniquity;
2 For as grass they shall quickly wither away,
And as the green herbs they shall quickly fall away.
3 Hope in the Lord, and do good;
And dwell in the land, and thou shalt be fed on its riches.
4 Delight thyself in the Lord,
And He shall give thee the petitions of thy heart.
5 Unveil thy way unto the Lord,
And hope in Him,
And He Himself shall do it; and He shall bring forth thy righteousness as light,
