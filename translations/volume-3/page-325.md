ΚΕΦ. ΚΗ´. ΙΕΡΕΜΙΑΣ 1263
χὴν αὐτοῦ, καὶ μὴ ἀπορίφθητε ἐν τῇ ἀδικίᾳ αὐτῆς, ὅτι καιρὸς
ἐκδικήσεως αὐτῆς ἐστι παρὰ Κυρίου, ἀνταπόδομα αὐτὸς ἀντα-
ποδίδωσιν αὐτῇ.
7 Ποτήριον χρυσοῦν Βαβυλὼν ἐν χειρὶ Κυρίου,
μεθύσκον πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν, ἀπὸ τοῦ οἴνου αὐτῆς ἔπιοσαν ἔθνη, διὰ
τοῦτο ἐσαλεύθησαν ἔθνη, καὶ ἄφνω ἔπεσε Βαβυλὼν, καὶ συνε-
8 τρίβη· θρηνεῖτε αὐτὴν, λάβετε ῥητίνην τῇ διαφθορᾷ αὐτῆς, εἰ´
πως ἰαθήσεται.
9 ᾿Ιατρεύσαμεν τὴν Βαβυλῶνα, καὶ οὐκ ἰάθη·
ἐγκαταλίπωμεν αὐτὴν, καὶ ἀπέλθωμεν ἕκαστος εἰς τὴν γῆν αὐ-
τοῦ, ὅτι ἤγγισεν εἰς οὐρανὸν τὸ κρῖμα αὐτῆς, ἐξῆρεν ἕως τῶν
10 ἄστρων. ᾿Εξήνεγκε Κύριος τὸ κρῖμα αὐτοῦ· δεῦτε, καὶ ἀναγ-
γείλωμεν ἐν Σιὼν τὰ ἔργα Κυρίου Θεοῦ ἡμῶν.
11 Παρασκευάσατε
τὰ τοξεύματα, πληροῦτε τὰς φαρέτρας· ἤγειρε Κύριος τὸ πνεῦμα
βασιλέως Μήδων, ὅτι εἰς Βαβυλῶνα ἡ ὀργὴ αὐτοῦ, τοῦ ἐξολε-
θρεῦσαι αὐτήν, ὅτι ἐκδίκησις Κυρίου ἐστὶν, ἐκδίκησις λαοῦ αὐ-
12 τοῦ ἐστιν. ᾿Επὶ τειχέων Βαβυλῶνος ἄρατε σημεῖον, ἐπιστήσατε
φαρέτρας, ἐγείρετε φύλακας, ἑτοιμάσατε ὅπλα, ὅτι ἐνεχείρησε,
καὶ ποιήσει Κύριος ἃ ἐλάλησεν ἐπὶ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας Βαβυ-
13 λῶνα, κατασκηνοῦντας ἐφ᾿ ὕδασι πολλοῖς, καὶ ἐπὶ πλήθει θησαυ-
ρῶν αὐτῆς· ἥκει τὸ πέρας σου ἀληθῶς ἐπὶ τὰ σπλάγχνα σου.
14 ῎Οτι ὤμοσε Κύριος τῶν δυνάμεων κατὰ τοῦ βραχίονος αὐτοῦ,
διότι πληρώσω σε ἀνθρώπων ὡσεὶ ἀκρίδων, καὶ φθέγξονται ἐπὶ
15 σὲ οἱ καταβαίνοντες. Ποιῶν γῆν ἐν τῇ ἰσχύϊ αὐτοῦ, ἑτοιμάζων
οἰκουμένην ἐν τῇ σοφίᾳ αὐτοῦ, ἐν τῇ συνέσει αὐτοῦ ἐξέτεινε τὸν
16 οὐρανὸν, εἰς φωνὴν ἔθετο ἦχος ὕδατος ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ, καὶ ἀνή-
γαγε νεφέλας ἀπ᾿ ἐσχάτου τῆς γῆς, ἀστραπὰς εἰς ὑετὸν ἐποίησε,
καὶ ἐξήγαγε φῶς ἐκ τῶν θησαυρῶν αὐτοῦ.
17 ᾿Εματαιώθη πᾶς
ἄνθρωπος ἀπὸ γνώσεως, κατησχύνθη πᾶς χρυσοχόος ἀπὸ τῶν
γλυπτῶν αὐτοῦ, ὅτι ψευδῆ ἔχουσιν, οὐκ ἔστι πνεῦμα ἐν αὐ-
18 τοῖς, μάταιά ἐστιν ἔργα μεμωκμημένα, ἐν καιρῷ ἐπισκέψεως αὐ-
τῶν ἀπολοῦνται.
19 Οὐ τοιαύτη μερὶς τῷ ᾿Ιακὼβ, ὅτι ὁ πλάσας
τὰ πάντα, αὐτὸς ἐστι ῥάβδος κληρονομίας αὐτοῦ, Κύριος τῶν
20 δυνάμεων ὄνομα αὐτῷ. Δια σκορπίζεις σύ μοι σκεύη πολέμου, κἀ-
γὼ διασκορπιῶ ἐν σοὶ ἔθνη, καὶ ἐξαρῶ ἐκ σοῦ βασιλεῖς.
21 Καὶ
διασκορπιῶ ἐν σοὶ ἵππον καὶ ἀναβάτην αὐτοῦ, καὶ διασκορπιῶ
22 ἐν σοὶ ἅρματα καὶ ἀναβάτας αὐτῶν, καὶ διασκορπιῶ ἐν σοὶ ἄν-
δρα καὶ γυναῖκα, καὶ διασκορπιῶ ἐν σοὶ πρεσβύτην καὶ νεανί-
σκον, νεανίσκον καὶ παρθένον, καὶ διασκορπιῶ ἐν σοὶ ποιμένα καὶ τὸ
23 ποίμνιον αὐτοῦ, καὶ διασκορπιῶ ἐν σοὶ γεωργὸν καὶ τὸ γεώργιον αὐτοῦ,
καὶ διασκορπιῶ ἐν σοὶ ἡγεμόνας καὶ στρατηγούς σου.
24 Καὶ ἀντα-
ποδώσω τῇ Βαβυλωνίᾳ καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς κατοικοῦσι Χαλδαίοις
πάσας τὰς ἀδικίας αὐτῶν, ἃς ἐποίησαν ἐπὶ Σιὼν κατ᾽ ὀφθαλ-
25 μοὺς ὑμῶν, λέγει Κύριος. Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ πρὸς σέ, τὸ ὄρος τὸ διε-
φθαρμένον, λέγει Κύριος, τὸ διαφθεῖρον πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν, καὶ
ἐκτενῶ τὴν χεῖρά μου ἐπὶ σέ, καὶ κατακυλίσω σε ἀπὸ τῶν πε-
26 τρῶν, καὶ δώσω σε ὡς ὄρος ἐμπεπυρισμένον, καὶ οὐ μὴ λάβωσιν
ἀπὸ σοῦ λίθον εἰς γωνίαν, καὶ λίθον εἰς θεμέλιον, ὅτι εἰς ἀφα-
27 νισμὸν ἔσῃ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, λέγει Κύριος. Ἄρατε σημεῖον ἐπὶ τῆς
γῆς, σαλπίσατε ἐν ἔθνεσι σάλπιγγι, ἁγιάσατε ἐπ᾽ αὐτὴν ἔθνη.
παραγγείλατε ἐπ᾽ αὐτὴν βασιλείας ᾿Αραρὲθ παρ᾽ ἐμοῦ, καὶ τοῖς
᾿Ασχαναζαίοις· ἐπιστήσατε ἐπ᾽ αὐτὴν βελοστάσεις, ἀναβιβασατε
28 ἐπ᾽ αὐτὴν ἵππον ὡς ἀκρίδων πλῆθος. ᾿Αναβιβασατε ἐπ᾽ αὐτὴν
ἔθνη, τὸν βασιλέα τῶν Μήδων καὶ πάσης τῆς γῆς, τοὺς ἡγε-
μόνας αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντας τοὺς στρατηγοὺς αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάσης
29 τῆς γῆς ἐξουσίας αὐτοῦ. ᾿Εσείσθη ἡ γῆ, καὶ ἐπόνεσε, διότι ἐξα-
νέστη ἐπὶ Βαβυλῶνα λογισμὸς Κυρίου, τοῦ θεῖναι τὴν γῆν Βα-
30 βυλῶνος εἰς ἀφανισμόν, καὶ μὴ κατοικεῖσθαι αὐτήν. ᾿Εξέλιπε
μαχητὴς Βαβυλῶνος τοῦ πολεμεῖν, καὶ καθήσονται ἐκεῖ ἐν πε-
ριοχῇ, ἐθραύσθη ἡ δυναστεία αὐτοῦ, ἐγενήθησαν ὡσεὶ γυναῖκες·
ἐνετυρίσθη τὰ σκηνώματα αὐτῆς, συνεντρίβησαν οἱ μοχλοὶ αὐτῆς.
31 Διώκων εἰς ἀπάντην διώκοντος διώξεται, καὶ ἀναγγέλλων εἰς
ἀπάντησιν ἀναγγέλλοντος τοῦ ἀναγγεῖλαι τῷ βασιλεῖ Βαβυλῶ-
32 νος, ὅτι ἑάλωκεν ἡ πόλις αὐτοῦ, ἀπ᾽ ἐσχάτου τῶν διαβάσεων
αὐτοῦ ἐλήφθησαν, καὶ τὰ συστήματα αὐτοῦ ἐνέπρησαν ἐν πυρί,
33 καὶ ἄνδρες αὐτοῦ οἱ πολεμισταὶ ἐξέρχονται. Διότι τάδε λέγει
Κύριος τῶν δυνάμεων ὁ Θεὸς ᾿Ισραήλ· οἴκοι βασιλέως Βαβυλῶ-
νος ὡς ἅλων ὥριμος ἀλοηθήσονται· ἔτι μικρόν, καὶ ἥξει ὁ ἀ-
34 μητὸς αὐτῆς. Κατέφαγέ με, ἐμερίσατό με, κατέλαβέ με σκότος
λεπτόν, Ναβουχοδονόσορ βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος κατέπιέ με, ὡς
35 δράκων ἔπλησε τὴν κοιλίαν αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τῆς τρυφῆς μου, ἐξωσάν
με οἱ μόχθοι μου καὶ αἱ ταλαιπωρίαι μου εἰς Βαβυλῶνα, ἐρεῖ
κατοικοῦσα Σιών, καὶ τὸ αἷμά μου ἐπὶ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας Χαλ-
36 δαίους, ἐρεῖ ῾Ιερουσαλήμ. Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Κύριος· ἰδοὺ

**Jeremiah, Chapter 28**
(Hebrew Chapter 51)

**6** ...soul; and be ye not cast off in her iniquity, for it is the time of her vengeance from the Lord; He Himself doth render recompense unto her.
**7** Babylon was a golden cup in the hand of the Lord, intoxicating all the earth. Of her wine have the nations drunk; therefore have the nations been shaken.
**8** And suddenly fell Babylon, and was broken. Lament ye for her! Take balm for her destruction, if so be that she might be healed.
**9** We have healed Babylon, but she was not healed. Let us forsake her, and let each man go unto his own land; for her judgment hath reached unto heaven, and is lifted up even unto the stars.
**10** The Lord hath brought forth His judgment. Come ye, and let us declare in Zion the works of the Lord our God.
**11** Prepare ye the arrows, fill the quivers! The Lord hath stirred up the spirit of the king of the Medes, for against Babylon is His wrath, to utterly destroy her; for it is the vengeance of the Lord, it is the vengeance of His people.
**12** Upon the walls of Babylon lift ye up a standard, set up the quivers, raise up the guards, prepare ye the weapons! For the Lord hath undertaken, and will do what He hath spoken against them that dwell in Babylon,
**13** that encamp upon many waters, and upon the abundance of her treasures. Verily, thy end is come upon thy very bowels.
**14** For the Lord of Hosts hath sworn by His arm, that I will fill thee with men as with locusts, and they that descend shall raise a cry against thee.
**15** He that maketh the earth by His power, that prepareth the world by His wisdom, by His understanding hath He stretched out the heaven.
**16** At the sound of His voice doth He set the roar of waters in the heaven, and hath brought up clouds from the ends of the earth. He hath made lightnings for rain, and brought forth light from His treasures.
**17** Every man is confounded for want of [true] knowledge; every goldsmith is put to shame by his graven images; for they have falsehood, there is no spirit in them.
**18** Vain are [these] works, mocked and derided; in the time of their visitation shall they perish.
**19** Not such is the portion of Jacob; for He who hath formed all things, He is the rod of His inheritance; the Lord of Hosts is His Name.
**20** Thou dost scatter for Me weapons of war; and I will scatter nations in thee, and I will take away kings from thee.
**21** And I will scatter in thee horse and his rider;
**22** and I will scatter in thee chariots and their riders; and I will scatter in thee man and woman; and I will scatter in thee old man and young man, young man and virgin; and I will scatter in thee shepherd and his flock;
**23** and I will scatter in thee farmer and his tillage; and I will scatter in thee thy rulers and commanders.
**24** And I will recompense to Babylon, and to all them that dwell in Chaldea, all their injustices which they have committed against Zion before your eyes, saith the Lord.
**25** Behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, saith the Lord, which destroyest all the earth. And I will stretch out My hand upon thee, and will roll thee down from the rocks;
**26** and I will make thee as a burnt mountain. And they shall not take from thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for a foundation; for thou shalt be for an utter desolation forever, saith the Lord.
**27** Lift ye up a standard upon the earth, blow the trumpet among the nations, sanctify nations against her! Summon against her the kingdoms of Ararat by Me, and the Ashkenaz; set up against her siege engines, bring up against her horses as a multitude of locusts.
**28** Bring up nations against her, the king of the Medes and of all the earth, his rulers, and all his commanders, and all the authorities of his land.
**29** The earth was shaken, and it travailed, because the purpose of the Lord hath risen up against Babylon, to make the land of Babylon an utter desolation, and that it should not be inhabited.
**30** The warrior of Babylon hath failed from fighting, and they shall sit there in confinement. His might was broken, they became as women. Her dwellings were burned up, her bars were broken in pieces.
**31** One running shall run to meet another runner, and one announcing to meet another announcing, to announce to the king of Babylon,
**32** that his city is taken, that they were taken from the uttermost of his passages, and his garrisons were burned with fire,
**33** and his men of war go forth. For thus saith the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel: The houses of the king of Babylon shall be threshed like a ripe threshing floor. Yet a little while, and her harvest shall come.
**34** "He hath devoured me, he hath divided me; a subtle darkness hath seized me," [saith Zion.] Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon hath swallowed me up; like a dragon he hath filled his belly from my delights. My travails and my hardships have cast me forth unto Babylon.
**35** Zion, that dwelleth [therein], shall say, "And my blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea." Jerusalem shall say.
**36** Therefore thus saith the Lord: Behold,
