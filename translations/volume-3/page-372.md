μολύνσεως ταύτης, ἧς ἐμίσησα. Καὶ οὐκ ἤκουσαν μου, καὶ οὐκ ἔκλιναν τὸ οὖς αὐτῶν ἀποστρέψαι ἀπὸ τῶν κακῶν αὐτῶν, πρὸς τὸ μὴ θυμιᾶν θεοῖς ἑτέροις. Καὶ ἔσταξεν ὁ θυμός μου ἡ ὀργή μου, καὶ ἐξεκχύθη ἐν πύλαις Ἰούδα, καὶ ἔξωθεν Ἱερουσαλήμ· καὶ ἐγενήθησαν εἰς ἐρήμωσιν καὶ εἰς ἄβατον, ὡς ἡ ἡμέρα αὕτη. Καὶ νῦν οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος παντοκράτωρ ὁ Θεὸς Σαβαὼθ, Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ· ἵνατί ὑμεῖς ποιεῖτε κακὰ μεγάλα ἐπὶ ψυχαῖς ὑμῶν; ἐκκόψαι ἀφ᾽ ὑμῶν ἄνθρωπον καὶ γυναῖκα, νήπιον καὶ θηλάζοντα ἐκ μέσου Ἰούδα, πρὸς τὸ μὴ καταλειφθῆναι ὑμῶν μηδένα, παραπικραίναι με ἐν τοῖς ἔργοις τῶν χειρῶν ὑμῶν, θυμιᾶν θεοῖς ἑτέροις ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ, εἰς ἣν εἰσήλθατε ἐνοικεῖν ἐκεῖ, ἵνα ἐκκοπῆτε, καὶ ἵνα γένησθε εἰς κατάραν καὶ εἰς ὀνειδισμὸν ἐν πάσαις ταῖς ἔθνεσι τῆς γῆς. Μὴ ἐπιλέλησθε ὑμεῖς τῶν κακῶν τῶν πατέρων ὑμῶν, καὶ τῶν κακῶν τῶν βασιλέων Ἰούδα, καὶ τῶν κακῶν τῶν ἀρχόντων ὑμῶν, καὶ τῶν κακῶν ὑμῶν, καὶ τῶν κακῶν τῶν γυναικῶν ὑμῶν, ὧν ἐποίησαν ἐν γῇ Ἰούδα, καὶ ἔξωθεν Ἱερουσαλήμ; Καὶ οὐκ ἐπαύσαντο ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης, καὶ οὐκ ἐφοβήθησαν, καὶ οὐκ ἀντείχοντο τῶν νόμων μου, καὶ τῶν προσταγμάτων μου, ὧν ἔδωκα κατὰ πρόσωπον ὑμῶν, καὶ κατὰ πρόσωπον τῶν πατέρων αὐτῶν. Διὰ τοῦτο οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος τῶν δυνάμεων ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ· Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐφίστημι τὸ πρόσωπόν μου ἐφ᾽ ὑμᾶς εἰς κακά, τοῦ ἐξολεθρεῦσαι πάντα τὸν Ἰούδαν καὶ λήψομαι τοὺς καταλοίπους Ἰούδα, τοὺς θέντας τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτῶν εἰσελθεῖν εἰς γῆν Αἴγυπτον παροικεῖν ἐκεῖ, τοῦ ἀπολέσαι πάντας τοὺς καταλοίπους τοὺς ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ, καὶ πεσοῦνται ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ, καὶ ἐν λιμῷ ἐκλείψουσιν ἀπὸ μικροῦ καὶ ἕως μεγάλου· καὶ ἐν μαχαίρᾳ καὶ ἐν λιμῷ ἀποθανοῦνται, καὶ ἔσονται εἰς ὅρκον, εἰς ὀνειδισμὸν, καὶ εἰς ἀπώλειαν, καὶ εἰς κατάραν. Καὶ ἐπισκέψομαι ἐπὶ τοὺς καθημένους ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ, ὡς ἐπεσκεψάμην ἐπὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ καὶ ἐν λιμῷ καὶ ἐν θανάτῳ, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται σεσωσμένος οὐδὲ περιλειπόμενος οὐδεὶς τῶν ἐπιλοίπων Ἰούδα τῶν ἐλθόντων παροικεῖν ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ, τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι εἰς γῆν Ἰούδα, ἐφ᾽ ἣν αὐτοὶ ἐλπίζουσι ταῖς ψυχαῖς αὐτῶν τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι ἐκεῖ· οὐ μὴ ἐπιστρέψουσιν, ἀλλ᾽ ἢ οἱ ἀνασεσωσμένοι. Καὶ ἀπεκρίθησαν τῷ Ἰερεμία ἅπαντες οἱ ἄνδρες, οἱ γνόντες, ὅτι θυμιῶσιν αἱ γυναῖκες αὐτῶν θεοῖς ἑτέροις, καὶ πᾶσαι αἱ γυναῖκες αἱ ἑστῶ-

**JEREMIAH 44**

**4** ...[this] defilement, which I have hated."
**5** But they hearkened not unto Me, neither inclined they their ear to turn away from their evil deeds,
**6** [so as] not to burn incense unto other gods. And My wrath dropped, even My indignation was poured out in the gates of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they became a desolation and an impassable waste, even as this day.
**7** And now, thus saith the Lord Almighty, the God of Hosts, God of Israel:
**8** "Wherefore do ye commit great evils against your own souls, to cut off from among you man and woman, infant and suckling, from the midst of Judah, so that none of you should be left, [and] to provoke Me to wrath with the works of your hands, by burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye have entered to sojourn there, that ye might be cut off, and that ye might become a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?
**9** Have ye forgotten the evils of your fathers, and the evils of the kings of Judah, and the evils of your princes, and your own evils, and the evils of your wives, which they wrought in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
**10** And they have not ceased [their evils] unto this day, neither have they feared, nor held fast to My laws and My commandments, which I gave before your face and before the face of your fathers.
**11** Therefore, thus saith the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I set My face against you for evil, to utterly destroy all Judah.
**12** And I will take the remnant of Judah, those who have set their face to enter into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and I will destroy all the remnant who are in Egypt. And they shall fall by the sword, and by famine shall they perish, from the least even to the greatest; and by the sword and by famine shall they die, and they shall be an oath and a reproach,
**13** and for utter destruction, and for a curse. And I will visit upon those who dwell in the land of Egypt, as I visited upon Jerusalem, with the sword and with famine and with pestilence.
**14** And there shall be none saved nor remaining of the rest of Judah, who have come to sojourn in the land of Egypt, to return into the land of Judah, unto which they hope in their souls to return thither; they shall not return, save only those who have been [miraculously] rescued."
**15** Then answered Jeremiah all the men who knew that their wives burned incense unto other gods, and all the women who stood [by],
