αὐτοῦ, οὓς ἐξαπεστείλατε ἐλευθέρους τῇ ψυχῇ αὐτῶν· καὶ ὑπετάξατε αὐτοὺς, τοῦ εἶναι ὑμῖν εἰς παῖδας καὶ παιδίσκας.
Διὰ 17 τοῦτο οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος· ὑμεῖς οὐκ ἠκούσατέ μου, τοῦ καλέσαι ἕκαστος ἄφεσιν πρὸς τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἕκαστος πρὸς τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ καλῶ ἄφεσιν ὑμῖν φησι Κύριος, εἰς μάχαιραν, καὶ εἰς τὸν θάνατον, καὶ εἰς τὸν λιμόν, καὶ δώσω ὑμᾶς εἰς διασπορὰν πάσαις ταῖς βασιλείαις τῆς γῆς·
καὶ δώσω 18 τοὺς ἄνδρας τοὺς παρεληλυθότας τὴν διαθήκην μου, τοὺς μὴ στήσαντας τοὺς λόγους τῆς διαθήκης μου, ἣν ἐποίησαν κατὰ πρόσωπόν μου, τὸν μόσχον ὃν ἐποίησαν εἰς δύο, καὶ δίηλθον διὰ μέσου τῶν διχοτομημάτων αὐτοῦ,
τοὺς ἄρχοντας Ἰούδα καὶ τοὺς 19 ἄρχοντας Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ τοὺς δυνάστας, καὶ τοὺς ἱερεῖς, καὶ πάντα τὸν λαὸν τῆς γῆς, τοὺς διελθόντας ἀναμέσον τῶν διχοτομημάτων τοῦ μόσχου.
Καὶ δώσω αὐτοὺς ἐν χειρὶ τῶν ἐχ- 20 θρῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐν χειρὶ τῶν ζητούντων τὰς ψυχὰς αὐτῶν· καὶ ἔσται τὰ θνησιμαῖα αὐτῶν βρώματα τοῖς πετεινοῖς τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ τοῖς θηρίοις τῆς γῆς.
Καὶ τὸν Σεδεκίαν βασιλέα Ἰούδα καὶ 21 τοὺς ἄρχοντας αὐτῶν δώσω εἰς χεῖρας ἐχθρῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ εἰς χεῖρας ζητούντων ψυχὴν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐν χειρὶ δυνάμεως βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος, τῶν ἀποτρεχόντων ἀπ᾽ αὐτῶν.
Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ συντάσσω, φησὶ 22 Κύριος, καὶ ἐπιστρέψω αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν γῆν ταύτην, καὶ πολεμήσουσιν ἐπ᾽ αὐτήν, καὶ λήψονται αὐτήν, καὶ κατακαύσουσιν αὐτὴν ἐν πυρί· καὶ τὰς πόλεις Ἰούδα δώσω αὐτὰς εἰς ἄβατον ἀπὸ κατοικούντων.

καὶ εἰσή- 4 γαγον αὐτοὺς εἰς οἶκον Κυρίου εἰς τὸ παστοφόριον υἱῶν Ἀνανίου, υἱοῦ Γοδολίου, ἀνθρώπου τοῦ Θεοῦ, ὅ ἐστιν ἐγγὺς οἴκου τῶν ἀρχόντων, τοῦ ἐπάνω τοῦ οἴκου Μααταίου υἱοῦ Σελὼμ, τοῦ φυλάσσοντος τὴν αὐλήν.
Καὶ ἔστησα κατὰ πρόσωπον αὐτῶν κεράμιον 5

**JEREMIAH 34 (Continued)**

**16** ...his, whom ye had sent forth free, as to their persons; yet ye subjected them again, to be unto you for manservants and maidservants.
**17** Therefore thus saith the Lord: Ye have not hearkened unto Me, to proclaim liberty every man to his brother, and every man to his neighbor; behold, I proclaim a liberty unto you, saith the Lord, unto the sword, and unto death, and unto the famine; and I shall give you up for a dispersion unto all the kingdoms of the earth.
**18** And I shall give the men who have transgressed My covenant, who established not the words of My covenant, which they made before My face—the calf which they cut into two parts, and passed between the divided pieces thereof—
**19** even the princes of Judah and the princes of Jerusalem, and the mighty men, and the priests, and all the people of the land, who passed through the midst of the divided pieces of the calf.
**20** And I shall give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their lives; and their dead bodies shall be meat for the birds of the heaven and for the beasts of the earth.
**21** And Zedekiah, the King of Judah, and their princes, I shall give into the hands of their enemies, and into the hands of those who seek their lives, and into the hand of the power of the King of Babylon, [even of] those who had turned away from them.
**22** Behold, I command, saith the Lord, and I shall bring them back into this land, and they shall war against it, and they shall take it, and they shall burn it with fire; and the cities of Judah shall I make desolate, void of inhabitants.

**JEREMIAH 42 (Septuagint) / JEREMIAH 35 (Hebrew)**

**1** The word that came unto Jeremiah from the Lord in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, King of Judah, saying:
**2** "Go thou unto the house of Archabein [the Rechabites], and call them into the house of the Lord, into one of the courts, and thou shalt give them wine to drink."
**3** And I brought Jeozaniah, the son of Jeremiah, the son of Chabasin, and his brethren, and his sons, and all the house of Archabein.
**4** And I brought them into the house of the Lord, into the chamber of the sons of Ananias, the son of Godoliah, a man of God, which is nigh unto the house of the princes, above the house of Maataios, the son of Selom, who kept the courtyard.
**5** And I set before their face a pitcher [of wine]...
