9 Ἀργύριον πορευτόν ἐστιν, οὐ πορεύσονται· ἀργύριον προσβλητὸν ἀπὸ
Θαρσὶς, ἥξει χρυσίον Μωρὰζ, καὶ χεῖρες χρυσοχόων, ἔργα τε-
χνιτῶν πάντα· ὑάκινθον καὶ πορφύραν ἐνδύσουσιν αὐτὰ ἔργα σο-
φῶν ἅπαντα αὐτοῖς.
10 Ὁ δὲ Κύριος ἀληθινὸς Θεός ἐστιν, Θεὸς
ζώντων, καὶ βασιλεὺς αἰώνιος· ἀπὸ παροξυσμοῦ αὐτοῦ σεισθή-
σεται ἡ γῆ, καὶ οὐχ ὑποίσοσιν ἔθνη ἐμβρίμησιν αὐτοῦ.
11 Οὕτως
ἐρεῖτε αὐτοῖς· θεοὶ οἳ τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ τὴν γῆν οὐκ ἐποίησαν, ἀ-
πολέσθωσαν ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς, καὶ ὑποκάτωθεν τοῦ οὐρανοῦ τούτου.
12 Κύριος ὁ ποιήσας τὴν γῆν ἐν τῇ ἰσχύϊ αὐτοῦ, ὁ ἀνορθώσας τὴν οἰ-
κουμένην ἐν τῇ σοφίᾳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ τῇ φρονήσει αὐτοῦ ἐξέτεινε τὸν
οὐρανὸν,
13 καὶ εἰς φωνὴν δίδοντος αὐτοῦ πλῆθος ὕδατος ἐν οὐρανῷ·
καὶ ἀνήγαγε νεφέλας ἐξ ἐσχάτου τῆς γῆς, ἀστραπὰς εἰς ὑετὸν ἐ-
ποίησε, καὶ ἐξήγαγε φῶς ἐκ θησαυρῶν αὐτοῦ.
14 Ἐμωράνθη πᾶς ἀν-
θρωπος ἀπὸ γνώσεως, κατησχύνθη πᾶς χρυσοχόος ἐπὶ τοῖς γλυ-
πτοῖς αὐτοῦ, ἔτι ψευδῆ ἐχνεύουσαν, οὐκ ἔστι πνεῦμα ἐν αὐτοῖς.
15 Μά-
ταιά ἐστιν ἔργα ἐμπεπαιγμένα, ἐν καιρῷ ἐπισκοπῆς αὐτῶν ἀπο-
λοῦνται.
16 Οὐκ ἔστι τοιαύτη μερὶς τῷ Ἰακώβ, ὅτι ὁ πλάσας τὰ
πάντα, αὐτὸς κληρονομία αὐτοῦ, καὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἔξοδος κληρονομίας
αὐτοῦ· Κύριος τῶν δυνάμεων ὄνομα αὐτοῦ.
17 Συνήγαγεν ἔξωθεν τὴν
ὑπόστασίν σου, ἡ κατοικοῦσα ἐν ἐκλεκτοῖς.
18 Ὅτι τάδε λέγει Κύ-
ριος· Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ σκελίζω τοὺς κατοικοῦντας τὴν γῆν ταύτην ἐν ὀλί-
ψει, ὅπως εὑρεθῇ ἡ πληγή σου.
19 Οὐαὶ ἐπὶ συντρίμματί σου, ἀλγη-
ρὰ ἡ πληγή σου· καὶ ἐγὼ εἶπα, ὄντως τοῦτο τὸ τραῦμά μου, καὶ
κατέλαβέ με.
20 Ἡ σκηνή μου ἐταλαιπώρησεν, ὤλετο· καὶ πᾶσαι αἱ
δέρρεις μου διεσπάσθησαν· οἱ υἱοί μου καὶ τὰ πρόβατά μου οὐκ
εἰσὶν, οὐκ ἔστιν ἔτι τόπος τῆς σκηνῆς μου, τόπος τῶν δεῤῥέων μου.
21 Ὅτι οἱ ποιμένες (μου) ἠφρονεύσαντο, καὶ τὸν Κύριον οὐκ ἐξεζή-
τησαν· διὰ τοῦτο οὐκ ἐνόησε πᾶσα ἡ νομὴ, καὶ διεσκορπίσθησαν.
22 Φωνὴ ἀκοῆς ἰδοὺ ἔρχεται καὶ σεισμὸς μέγας ἐκ γῆς βοῤῥᾶ, τοῦ τά-
ξαι τὰς πόλεις Ἰούδα εἰς ἀφανισμόν, καὶ κοίτην στρουθῶν.
23 Οἶδα,
Κύριε, ὅτι οὐχὶ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ἡ ὁδὸς αὐτοῦ, οὐδὲ ἀνὴρ πορεύσεται,
καὶ κατορθώσει πορείαν αὐτοῦ.
24 Παιδεύσον ἡμᾶς, Κύριε, πλὴν ἐν
κρίσει, καὶ μὴ ἐν θυμῷ, ἵνα μὴ ὀλίγους ἡμᾶς ποιήσῃς.
25 Ἔκχεον τὸν
θυμόν σου ἐπὶ ἔθνη τὰ μὴ εἰδότα σε, καὶ ἐπὶ γενεὰς, αἳ τὸ ὄνομά
σου οὐκ ἐπεκαλέσαντο, ὅτι κατέφαγον τὸν Ἰακὼβ, καὶ ἐξανήλωσαν
αὐτὸν, καὶ τὴν νομὴν αὐτοῦ ἠρήμωσαν.

CHAPTER X.

**9** ...[Silver] is portable; they shall not go forth. Overlaid silver shall come from Tarshish, [and] gold from Moraz, and the hands of goldsmiths; all are works of craftsmen. They shall clothe them in hyacinth and purple; all these are the works of cunning men.
**10** But the Lord is the true God, the God of the living, and an everlasting King. At the provocation of Him the earth shall be shaken, and the nations shall not endure His fierce indignation.
**11** Thus shall ye say unto them: The gods that have not made the heaven and the earth, let them perish from the earth, and from under this heaven.
**12** The Lord, who made the earth by His strength, who established the inhabited world by His wisdom, and by His understanding stretched out the heaven;
**13** and at the voice of His giving, [there is] a multitude of waters in heaven. And He hath brought up clouds from the ends of the earth; He hath made lightnings for the rain, and hath brought forth light from His treasures.
**14** Every man is made foolish from [lack of] knowledge; every goldsmith is put to shame on account of his graven images, [which are] still tracking falsehood; there is no spirit in them.
**15** They are vain works, made for mockery; in the time of their visitation they shall perish.
**16** Not such a portion is for Jacob, for He who formed all things, He Himself is his inheritance; and Israel is the going forth of His inheritance. The Lord of hosts is His Name.
**17** He hath gathered out from abroad thy substance, O thou that dwellest among the elect.
**18** For thus saith the Lord: Behold, I will trip up those that dwell in this land in affliction, that thy wound may be found.
**19** Woe upon thy crushing! Painful is thy wound. And I said, "Truly this is my wound, and it hath seized me."
**20** My tent hath suffered; it hath perished. And all my tent-curtains have been torn apart. My sons and my sheep are no more. There is no longer a place for my tent, [nor] a place for my tent-curtains.
**21** For my shepherds have become foolish, and they sought not the Lord. Therefore the whole flock did not understand, and they were scattered.
**22** A voice of tidings, behold, it cometh, and a great earthquake from the land of the north, to appoint the cities of Judah for desolation, and a dwelling place of ostriches.
**23** I know, O Lord, that the way of man is not his own, neither shall a man walk and direct his steps.
**24** Chasten us, O Lord, but in judgment, and not in wrath, lest Thou make us few.
**25** Pour out Thy wrath upon the nations that know Thee not, and upon the generations that have not called upon Thy Name; for they have devoured Jacob, and utterly consumed him, and have desolated his habitation.
