    Ὃς δέ ὁ βασιλεὺς ὁ βασιλεύσας αὐτὸν, ὃς ἠτίμωσε τὴν ἀράν μου, καὶ
ὃς παρέβη τὴν διαθήκην μου, μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἐν μέσῳ Βαβυλῶνος τε-
λευτήσει. Καὶ οὐκ ἐν δυνάμει μεγάλῃ οὐδὲ ἐν ὄχλῳ πολλῷ, ποιή- 17
σει πρὸς αὐτὸν Φαραὼ πόλεμον ἐν χαρακοβολίᾳ καὶ ἐν οἰκοδομῇ
βελοστάσεως, τοῦ ἐξᾶραι ψυχὰς πολλάς· καὶ ἠτίμασεν ὁρκωμο- 18
σίαν τοῦ παραβῆναι διαθήκην· καὶ ἰδοὺ δέδωκε τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ,
καὶ πάντα ταῦτα ἐποίησεν αὐτῷ, μὴ σωθήσεται. Διὰ τοῦτο εἰπόν· 19
τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναὶ Κύριος· Ζῶ ἐγὼ, ἐὰν μὴ τὴν ὁρκωμοσίαν μου, ἣν
ἠτίμασε, καὶ τὴν διαθήκην μου, ἣν παρέβη, καὶ δώσω αὐτὴν εἰς κε-
φαλὴν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐκπετάσω ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν τὸ δίκτυόν μου, καὶ ἁλώσε- 20
ται ἐν τῇ περιοχῇ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἄξω αὐτὸν εἰς Βαβυλῶνα, καὶ διακρι-
θήσομαι μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἐκεῖ τὴν ἀδικίαν αὐτοῦ, ἣν ἠδίκησεν ἐν ἐμοί·
καὶ πάσας φυγαδείας αὐτοῦ ἐν πάσῃ τῇ παρατάξει αὐτοῦ ἐν ῥομ- 21
φαίᾳ πεσοῦνται· καὶ τοὺς καταλοίπους εἰς πάντα ἄνεμον διασπερῶ,
καὶ ἐπιγνώσεσθε, διότι ἐγὼ Κύριος λελάληκα. Διὰ τοῦτο εἰπόν· 22
τάδε λέγει Κύριος· καὶ λήψομαι ἐγὼ ἐκ τῶν ἐπιλέκτων τῆς κέδρου
ἐκ κορυφῆς, καὶ δώσω ἀπὸ κεφαλῆς παραφυάδων αὐτῆς, καρδίας
αὐτῶν ἀποκνιῶ, καὶ καταφυτεύσω ἐγὼ ἐπ᾿ ὄρος ὑψηλὸν, καὶ κρεμά- 23
σω αὐτὸν ἐν ὄρει μετεώρῳ τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ καταφυτεύσω, καὶ ἐξέ-
σει βλαστὸν, καὶ ποιήσει καρπὸν, καὶ ἔσται εἰς κέδρον μεγάλην·
καὶ ἀναπαύσεται ὑποκάτω αὐτοῦ πᾶν ὄρνεον, καὶ πᾶν πετεινὸν
ὑπὸ τὴν σκιὰν αὐτοῦ ἀναπαύσεται, τὰ κλήματα αὐτοῦ ἀποκατα-
σταθήσεται, καὶ γνώσονται πάντα τὰ ξύλα τοῦ ἀγροῦ, διότι ἐγὼ 24
Κύριος ὁ ταπεινῶν ξύλον ὑψηλὸν, καὶ ὁ ὑψῶν ξύλον ταπεινὸν, καὶ
ξηραίνων ξύλον χλωρὸν, καὶ ἀναβάλλων ξύλον ξηρὸν, ἐγὼ Κύριος
λελάληκα καὶ ποιήσω.

           ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς μὲ, λέγων· υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, 1
τί ὑμῖν ἡ παραβολὴ αὕτη ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς ἐν τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραὴλ, λέγον- 2
τες, οἱ πατέρες ἔφαγον ὄμφακα, καὶ οἱ ὀδόντες τῶν τέκνων ἐγομ-

ἡ παραβολὴ αὕτη ἐν τῷ Ἰσραήλ. Ὅτι πᾶσαι αἱ ψυχαὶ ἐμαί εἰσιν, 4
ὃν τρόπον ἡ ψυχὴ τοῦ πατρὸς, οὕτως καὶ ἡ ψυχὴ τοῦ υἱοῦ, ἐμαί
εἰσιν, ἡ ψυχὴ ἡ ἁμαρτάνουσα, αὕτη ἀποθανεῖται, καὶ τοῦ φάγον-

### Chapter 17

**16** But the king, he that made him king, who dishonored My oath, and who transgressed My covenant, with him in the midst of Babylon shall he die.
**17** And not with great power, nor with a great multitude, shall Pharaoh make war against him with a siege-mound and with the building of a rampart, to cut off many lives.
**18** For he dishonored an oath by transgressing a covenant; and behold, he gave his hand, yet did all these things unto him; shall he be saved?
**19** Therefore say thou: Thus saith Adonai the Lord: As I live, surely My oath, which he hath dishonored, and My covenant, which he hath transgressed, I will bring it upon his own head.
**20** And I will spread My net upon him, and he shall be caught in its mesh; and I will bring him unto Babylon, and there will I contend with him concerning his injustice, which he hath committed against Me.
**21** And all his fugitives, with all his array, shall fall by the sword; and those that remain I will scatter to every wind, and ye shall know that I the Lord have spoken.
**22** Therefore say thou: Thus saith the Lord: And I will take from the choicest of the cedar, from its topmost part; and I will set [it] from the head of its offshoots, [even] the hearts of them I will pluck off; and I will plant it upon a high mountain, and establish it aloft on the lofty mountain of Israel.
**23** And it shall be planted, and shall bring forth a shoot, and shall bear fruit, and it shall become a great cedar; and under it shall every bird rest, and every fowl shall rest under its shade; its branches shall be restored.
**24** And all the trees of the field shall know that I the Lord am He who bringeth low the high tree, and raiseth up the low tree, and maketh dry the green tree, and maketh to sprout the dry tree: I the Lord have spoken and I will do it.

### Chapter 18

**1** Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying: Son of man,
**2** what mean ye by this parable in the land among the sons of Israel, saying, "The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the teeth of the children are set on edge?"
**3** As I live, saith Adonai the Lord, surely this parable shall no longer be spoken in Israel.
**4** For all souls are Mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son, they are Mine. The soul that sinneth, it shall die; and of him that eateth the sour grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge.
**5** Now the man who shall be righteous, who executeth judgment and righteousness,
