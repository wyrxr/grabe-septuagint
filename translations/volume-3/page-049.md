καλάμου· ἡ συναγωγὴ τῶν ταύρων ἐν τοῖς δαμάλεσι τῶν λαῶν,
τοῦ μὴ ἀποκλεισθῆναι τοὺς δεδοκιμασμένους τῷ ἀργυρίῳ· διασκόρ-
πισον ἔθνη τὰ τοὺς πολέμους θέλοντα. Ἔχουσι πρέσβεις ἐξ Αἰ- 32
γύπτου· Αἰθιοπία προφθάσει χεῖρα αὐτῆς τῷ Θεῷ· Αἱ βασιλεῖαι 33
τῆς γῆς ᾄσατε τῷ Θεῷ, ψάλατε τῷ Κυρίῳ. Διάψαλμα. Ψάλατε 34
τῷ Θεῷ τῷ ἐπιβεβηκότι ἐπὶ τὸν οὐρανὸν τοῦ οὐρανοῦ κατὰ ἀνα-
τολάς· ἰδοὺ δώσει ἐν τῇ φωνῇ αὐτοῦ φωνὴν δυνάμεως. Δότε δό- 35
ξαν τῷ Θεῷ· ἐπὶ τὸν Ἰσραὴλ ἡ μεγαλοπρέπεια αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἡ δύ-
ναμις αὐτοῦ ἐν ταῖς νεφέλαις. Θαυμαστὸς ὁ Θεὸς ἐν τοῖς ὁσίοις 36
αὐτοῦ· ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραὴλ αὐτὸς δώσει δύναμιν καὶ κραταίωσιν τῷ
λαῷ αὐτοῦ· εὐλογητὸς ὁ Θεός.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ΞΗ'. LXVIII.**

Εἰς τὸ τέλος, ὑπὲρ τῶν ἀλλοιωθησομένων τῷ Δαυίδ. Σῶσόν 1
με ὁ Θεός, ὅτι εἰσῆλθον ὕδατα ἕως ψυχῆς μου. Ἐνεπάγην 2
εἰς ἰλὺν βυθοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ὑπόστασις· ἦλθον εἰς τὰ βάθη τῆς
θαλάσσης, καὶ καταιγὶς κατεπόντισέ με. Ἐκοπίασα κράζων, ἐβρα- 3
χίασεν ὁ λάρυγξ μου· ἐξέλιπον οἱ ὀφθαλμοί μου ἀπὸ τοῦ ἐλπίζειν
με ἐπὶ τὸν Θεόν μου. Ἐπληθύνθησαν ὑπὲρ τὰς τρίχας τῆς κεφα- 4
λῆς μου οἱ μισοῦντές με δωρεάν· ἐκραταιώθησαν οἱ ἐχθροί μου,
οἱ ἐκδιώκοντές με ἀδίκως· ἃ οὐχ ἤρπασα, τότε ἀπετίννυον. Ὁ 5
Θεός σὺ ἔγνως τὴν ἀφροσύνην μου, καὶ αἱ πλημμέλειαί μου ἀπὸ
σοῦ οὐκ ἐκρύβησαν. Μὴ αἰσχυνθείησαν ἐπ᾿ ἐμὲ οἱ ὑπομένοντές σε 6
Κύριε, Κύριε τῶν δυνάμεων· μὴ ἐντραπείησαν ἐπ᾿ ἐμὲ οἱ ζητοῦν-
τές σε ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ Ἰσραήλ. Ὅτι ἕνεκά σου ὑπήνεγκα ὀνειδισμόν, 7
ἐκάλυψεν ἐντροπὴ τὸ πρόσωπόν μου· ἀπηλλοτριωμένος ἐγενήθην 8
τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς μου, καὶ ξένος τοῖς υἱοῖς τῆς μητρός μου. Ὅτι ὁ ζῆ- 9
λος τοῦ οἴκου σου κατέφαγέ με, καὶ οἱ ὀνειδισμοὶ τῶν ὀνειδιζόν-
των σε ἐπέπεσον ἐπ᾿ ἐμέ. Καὶ συνεκάλυψα ἐν νηστείᾳ τὴν ψυχήν 10
μου, καὶ ἐγενήθη εἰς ὀνειδισμοὺς ἐμοί· καὶ ἐθέμην τὸ ἔνδυμά μου 11
σάκκον, καὶ ἐγενόμην αὐτοῖς εἰς παραβολήν. Κατ᾿ ἐμοῦ ἠδολέ- 12
σχουν οἱ καθήμενοι ἐν πύλῃ, καὶ εἰς ἐμὲ ἐξάλλοντο οἱ πίνοντες τὸν
οἶνον. Ἐγὼ δὲ τῇ προσευχῇ μου πρὸς σὲ Κύριε· καιρὸς εὐδοκίας, 13
ὁ Θεός· ἐν τῷ πλήθει τοῦ ἐλέους σου ἐπάκουσόν μου, ἐν ἀληθείᾳ
τῆς σωτηρίας σου. Σῶσόν με ἀπὸ πηλοῦ, ἵνα μὴ ἐμπαγῶ· ῥυσθεῖν 14
ἐκ τῶν μισούντων με, καὶ ἐκ τῶν βαθέων τῶν ὑδάτων.

**PSALM LXVII. [Continued]**

31 [Rebuke] the beasts of the reed,
The assembly of bulls amidst the calves of the peoples,
That they who have been tried by silver may not be shut out;
Scatter the nations that delight in wars.
32 Princes shall come forth from Egypt;
Ethiopia shall hasten to stretch out her hand unto God.
33 Ye kingdoms of the earth, sing unto God;
Chant praises unto the Lord.
Selah.
34 Chant praises unto God,
To Him that rideth upon the Heaven of Heaven from the East;
Lo, He shall give forth with His voice a voice of power.
35 Give ye glory unto God;
Over Israel is His magnificence,
And His power in the clouds.
36 Wonderful is God in His holy ones;
The God of Israel, He Himself shall give power and strength unto His people.
Blessed be God.

**PSALM LXVIII.**

*For the End, concerning them that shall be changed; A Psalm of David.*

1 Save me, O God,
For the waters are come in even unto my soul.
2 I am stuck fast in mire of the deep,
And there is no standing [for me];
I am come into the depths of the sea,
And a tempest hath overwhelmed me.
3 I am wearied with crying out,
My throat is become hoarse;
Mine eyes have failed from hoping in my God.
4 They that hate me without a cause
Are multiplied beyond the hairs of my head;
My foes who persecute me unjustly have been made strong;
What I took not away, then I restored.
5 O God, Thou hast known my foolishness,
And my transgressions are not hidden from Thee.
6 Let them not be put to shame through me
Who wait for Thee, O Lord, Lord of Hosts;
Let them not be confounded through me
Who seek Thee, O God of Israel.
7 For for Thy sake have I borne reproach;
Shame hath covered my face.
8 I am become alienated from my brethren,
And a stranger unto the sons of my mother.
9 For the zeal of Thine house hath consumed me;
And the reproaches of them that reproach Thee are fallen upon me.
10 And I covered my soul with fasting,
And it became unto me a reproach.
11 And I made sackcloth my garment,
And I became unto them a byword.
12 They that sit in the gate spoke against me,
And those who drink wine made revelry over me.
13 But as for me, my prayer is unto Thee, O Lord,
O God, in a time of favor;
In the multitude of Thy mercy, hearken unto me,
In the truth of Thy salvation.
14 Save me from the mire, lest I sink therein;
Deliver me from them that hate me, and from the deep waters.
