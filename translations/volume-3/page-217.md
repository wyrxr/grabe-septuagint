ἀνθρώπων ἀδικουμένων (εὐλογήσουσί σε.) Ὡς ἄνθρωποι ὀλιγό- 5
ψυχοι διψῶντες ἐν Σιὼν, ἀπὸ ἀνθρώπων ἀσεβῶν, οἷς ἡμᾶς
παρέδωκας καύσωνα ἐν σκέπῃ νέφους, κληματίδα ἰσχυρῶν ταπει-
νώσει. Καὶ ποιήσει Κύριος Σαβαὼθ πᾶσι τοῖς ἔθνεσιν ἐπὶ τὸ 6
ὄρος τοῦτο πίονται εὐφροσύνην, πίονται οἶνον. Χρίσονται μύρον 7
τρυγιῶν διϋλισμένων ἐν τῷ ὄρει τούτῳ, παράδος ταῦτα πάντα
τοῖς ἔθνεσιν· ἡ γὰρ βουλὴ αὕτη ἐπὶ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη. Κατέπιεν 8
ὁ θάνατος ἰσχύσας, καὶ πάλιν ἀφεῖλε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς πᾶν δά-
κρυον ἀπὸ παντὸς προσώπου· τὸ ὄνειδος τοῦ λαοῦ ἀφεῖλεν ἀπὸ
πάσης τῆς γῆς, τὸ γὰρ στόμα Κυρίου ἐλάλησε. Καὶ ἐροῦσιν ἐν 9
τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ· Ἰδοὺ ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν, ἐφ᾿ ᾧ ἠλπίζομεν, καὶ σώ-
σει ἡμᾶς· οὗτος Κύριος, ὑπεμείναμεν αὐτὸν, καὶ ἠγαλλιώμεθα
καὶ εὐφράνθημεν ἐπὶ τῇ σωτηρίᾳ ἡμῶν. Ὅτι ἀνάπαυσιν δώσει 10
ὁ Θεὸς ἐπὶ τὸ ὄρος τοῦτο, καὶ καταπατηθήσεται ἡ Μωαβῖτις
ἐν τῷ τόπῳ αὐτῆς, ὃν τρόπον πατῶσιν ἄλωνα ἐν ἀμάξαις. Καὶ 11
ἀνήσει τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ, ὃν τρόπον καὶ αὐτὸς ἐταπείνωσε
τοῦ ἀπολέσαι· καὶ ταπεινώσει τὴν ὕβριν αὐτοῦ, ἐφ᾿ ἃς τὰς χεῖ-
ρας ἐπέβαλε. Καὶ τὸ ὕψος τῆς καταφυγῆς τοῦ τοίχου σου τα- 12
πεινώσει, καὶ καταβήσεται ἕως τοῦ ἐδάφους, ἕως κόνεως.

**ΚΕΦ. Κς΄. XXVI.**

(Ὠδὴ) Τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ᾄσονται τὸ ἆσμα τοῦτο ἐπὶ γῆς 1
Ἰούδα, λέγοντες· Ἰδοὺ πόλις ἰσχυρὰ, καὶ σωτήριον ἡμῖν θήσει
τεῖχος, καὶ περίτειχος. Ἀνοίξατε πύλας, εἰσελθάτω δίκαιος λαὸς 2
φυλάσσων δικαιοσύνην, καὶ φυλάσσων ἀλήθειαν, ἀντιλαμβανό- 3
μενος ἀληθείας, καὶ φυλάσσων εἰρήνην, εἰρήνην· ὅτι ἐπὶ σοὶ ἐλ-
πίδι ἤλπισαν, Κύριε, ἕως τοῦ αἰῶνος, ὁ Θεὸς ὁ μέγας, ὁ αἰώ- 4
νιος, ὃς ταπεινώσας κατήγαγες τοὺς ἐνοικοῦντας ἐν ὑψηλοῖς· 5
πόλεις ὀχυρὰς καταβαλεῖ, καὶ κατάξεις αὐτὰς ἕως τοῦ ἐδάφους.
Καὶ πατήσουσιν αὐτὰς πόδες πραέων καὶ ταπεινῶν. Ὁδὸς 6.7
εὐσεβῶν εὐθεῖα εὐθεῖα ἐγένετο, καὶ παρεσκευασμένη ἡ ὁδὸς τῶν
εὐσεβῶν. Ἡ γὰρ ὁδὸς Κυρίου κρίσις· ἠλπίσαμεν ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνό- 8
ματί σου, καὶ ἐπὶ τῇ μνεία, ἣν ἐπιθυμεῖ ἡ ψυχὴ ἡμῶν ἐπιθυμία 9
ψυχῆς. (Ὠδὴ) ἐκ νυκτὸς ὀρθρίζει τὸ πνεῦμά μου πρός σε ὁ Θεὸς,
διότι φῶς τὰ προστάγματά σου ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς· δικαιοσύνην μάθετε

**Chapter 25**

**4** ...[even] the spirit of oppressed men, (they shall bless thee).
**5** As faint-hearted men [who are] thirsty in Zion, from wicked men, to whom Thou didst deliver us a scorching heat in the shelter of a cloud, [so] shall He bring low the vine-branch of the mighty.
**6** And the Lord Sabaoth shall make for all the nations upon this mountain a feast of rejoicing; they shall drink wine.
**7** They shall be anointed with the perfume of filtered dregs upon this mountain. Deliver all these things unto the nations, for this counsel is for all the nations.
**8** Death, having waxed mighty, hath swallowed [all things] up; and again, the Lord God hath wiped away every tear from off every face. The reproach of His people hath He taken away from all the earth, for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.
**9** And they shall say in that day, "Behold, this is our God, in whom we hoped, and He shall save us. This is the Lord; we have waited for Him, and we have rejoiced and been glad in our salvation."
**10** For God shall give rest upon this mountain, and Moab shall be trodden down in her place, even as a threshing-floor is trodden down by wagons.
**11** And he shall let fall his hands, in the manner that he himself humbled [others] to destroy; and He shall bring down his pride, in those things upon which he laid his hands.
**12** And the height of the refuge of thy wall shall He bring low, and it shall come down even to the ground, even to the dust.

**Chapter 26**

**1** (A Song) In that day shall they sing this song in the land of Judah, saying, "Behold, a strong city, and He shall set salvation for us as a wall, and a bulwark."
**2** Open ye the gates, that the righteous people, keeping righteousness, and keeping truth, may enter in;
**3** holding fast to truth, and keeping peace, [yea], peace; for in Thee have they hoped with hope, O Lord, even unto the age [everlasting].
**4** O great God, O Everlasting One, who by humbling hast brought down them that dwell on high;
**5** strong cities shall He cast down, and He shall bring them low even to the ground.
**6** And the feet of the meek and the humble shall tread them down.
**7** The way of the godly was made straight, [yea], straight, and the path of the godly was made ready.
**8** For the way of the Lord is judgment. We have hoped in Thy Name, and in Thy remembrance,
**9** which our soul desires with a soul's desire. (A Song) From the night doth my spirit rise early unto Thee, O God, for Thy commandments are light upon the earth; learn righteousness,
