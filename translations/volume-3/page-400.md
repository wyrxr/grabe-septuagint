25 στρέψω τὸ φρύαγμα τῆς ἰσχύος αὐτῶν, καὶ μιανθήσεται τὰ ἅγια
   αὐτῶν. Ἐξιλασμὸς ἥξει, καὶ ζητήσει (εἰς) εἰρήνην, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται.
26 Οὐαὶ ἐπὶ οὐαὶ ἔσται, καὶ ἀγγελία ἐπὶ ἀγγελίαν ἔσται, καὶ ζητηθή-
   σεται ὅρασις ἐκ προφήτου, καὶ νόμος ἀπολεῖται ἐξ ἱερέως, καὶ
27 βουλὴ ἐκ πρεσβυτέρων. Ὁ βασιλεὺς πενθήσει, καὶ ὁ ἄρχων ἐνδύ-
   σεται ἀφανισμόν, καὶ αἱ χεῖρες τοῦ λαοῦ τῆς γῆς παραλυθήσον-
   ται· κατὰ τοὺς ὁδοὺς αὐτῶν πείσω αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἐν τοῖς κρίμασιν
   αὐτῶν ἐκδικήσω αὐτοὺς, καὶ γνώσονται ὅτι ἐγὼ Κύριος.

                           ΚΕΦ. Ηʹ. VIII.

1  ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἕκτῳ ἔτει ἐν τῷ πέμπτῳ μηνὶ, πέμπτῃ τοῦ
   μηνὸς, ἐγὼ ἐκαθήμην ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ, καὶ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι Ἰούδα ἐκά-
2  θηντο ἐνώπιον ἐμοῦ· καὶ ἐγένετο ἐπ’ ἐμὲ χεὶρ ᾿Αδωναὶ Κυρίου, καὶ
   ἴδον, καὶ ἰδοὺ ὁμοίωμα ἀνδρὸς, ἀπὸ τῆς ὀσφύος αὐτοῦ καὶ ἕως κάτω
   πῦρ, καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς ὀσφύος αὐτοῦ καὶ ὑπεράνω αὐτοῦ ὡς ὅρασις ἀργας,
   ὡς εἶδος ἠλέκτρου.
3  Καὶ ἐξέτεινεν ὁμοίωμα χειρὸς, καὶ ἀνέλαβέ με τῆς κορυφῆς μου,
   καὶ ἀνέλαβέ με πνεῦμα ἀναμέσον τῆς γῆς καὶ ἀναμέσον τοῦ οὐρανοῦ,
   καὶ ἤγαγέ με εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐν δράσει Θεοῦ ἐπὶ τὰ πρόθυρα τῆς
   πύλης τῆς ἐσωτέρας τῆς βλεπούσης πρὸς βορρᾶν, οὗ ἦν ἡ στήλη τῆς
   εἰκόνος τοῦ ζήλου τοῦ κτωμένου.
4  Καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐκεῖ ἦν δόξα Κυρίου Θεοῦ Ἰσραὴλ κατὰ τὴν ὅρασιν, ἣν
   ἴδον ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ.
5  Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς με· Υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, ἀνάβλεψον τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς σου
   πρὸς βορρᾶν· καὶ ἀνέβλεψα τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς μου πρὸς βορρᾶν, καὶ
   ἰδοὺ ἀπὸ βορρᾶ ἐπὶ τὴν πύλην τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου ἡ εἰκὼν τοῦ ζήλου
   τούτου ἐν τῷ εἰσπορεύεσθαι αὐτὴν (τὴν βλέπουσαν) πρὸς ἀνατολάς.
6  Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς με· Υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, ἑώρακας τί οὗτοι ποιοῦσιν;
   ἀνομίας μεγάλας, ἃς ὁ οἶκος Ἰσραὴλ ποιοῦσιν ὧδε, τοῦ ἀπέχεσθαι
   ἀπὸ τῶν ἁγίων μου, καὶ ἔτι ξύη ἁμαρτίας μείζονας.
7  Καὶ εἰσήγαγέ με ἐπὶ τὰ πρόθυρα τῆς αὐλῆς, καὶ ἴδον, καὶ ἰδοὺ
   ὀπὴ μία ἐν τῷ τοίχῳ.
8  Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς με· Υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, ὄρυξον δὴ ἐν τῷ τοίχῳ.
9  Καὶ ὤρυξα ἐν τῷ τοίχῳ, καὶ ἰδοὺ θύρα μία. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς με·
   Εἴσελθε, καὶ ἴδε τὰς ἀνομίας τὰς πονηρὰς, ἃς οὗτοι ποιοῦσιν ὧδε
   σήμερον.
10 Καὶ εἰσῆλθον, καὶ ἴδον, καὶ ἰδοὺ πᾶσα ὁμοίωσις ἑρπετοῦ καὶ
   κτήνους μάταια βδελύγματα, καὶ (εἶδον) πάντα τὰ εἴδωλα οἴκου
   Ἰσραὴλ διαγεγραμμένα ἐπ’ αὐτοῦ τοίχου κύκλῳ κύκλῳ.

### Chapter 7

**25** I will turn away the roaring of their strength, and their holy [places] shall be defiled. Calamity shall come, and [they] shall seek for peace, but it shall not be.
**26** Woe upon woe shall be, and tidings upon tidings shall be, and a vision from a prophet shall be sought, and the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.
**27** The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be paralyzed; according to their ways will I deal with them, and in their judgments will I requite them, and they shall know that I am the Lord.

### Chapter 8

**1** And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the fifth month, on the fifth day of the month, that I sat in the house, and the elders of Judah sat before me.
**2** And the hand of Adonai the Lord came upon me; and I looked, and behold, a likeness of a man, from his loins and downward, fire, and from his loins and upward from him, as a vision of a gleaming brightness, as the appearance of electrum.
**3** And He stretched forth the likeness of a hand, and took me by the hair of my head, and a spirit lifted me up between the earth and between the heaven, and brought me to Jerusalem in a vision of God, to the entrance of the inner gate which looketh toward the north, where was the pillar of the image of jealousy which provoketh [to jealousy].
**4** And behold, there was the glory of the Lord God of Israel, according to the vision which I saw in the plain.
**5** And He said unto me: "Son of man, lift up thine eyes toward the north!" And I lifted up my eyes toward the north, and behold, from the north, upon the gate of the altar, was this image of jealousy, at its entering, [the gate] which looketh toward the east.
**6** And He said unto me: "Son of man, hast thou seen what these do? Great abominations which the house of Israel commit here, to estrange themselves from My holy things, and yet [they commit] scrapings of greater sins."
**7** And He brought me to the entrance of the court, and I looked, and behold, a hole in the wall.
**8** And He said unto me: "Son of man, dig now in the wall!"
**9** And I dug in the wall, and behold, a door. And He said unto me: "Enter, and see the wicked abominations which these commit here this day."
**10** And I entered, and I saw, and behold, every likeness of creeping thing and of beast, vain abominations, and [I saw] all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed upon the wall itself, all around, all around.
