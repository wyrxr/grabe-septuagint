ΚΕΦ. ϛ΄. ΙΕΡΕΜΙΑΣ 1223
σημεῖον, ὅτι κακὰ ἐκκέχυται ἀπὸ βορρᾶ, καὶ συντριβὴ μεγάλη γίνεται, καὶ ἀφαιρεθήσεται τὸ ὕφος σου, θύγατερ Σιών.
**2.** **3.** Εἰς αὐτὴν ἤχουσι ποιμένες, καὶ τὰ ποίμνια αὐτῶν, καὶ πήξουσιν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὴν σκηνὰς κύκλῳ, καὶ ποιμανοῦσιν ἕκαστος τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ.
**4.** Παρασκευάσασθε ἐπ᾿ αὐτὴν εἰς πόλεμον, ἀνάστητε, καὶ ἀναβῶμεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὴν μεσημβρίας· οὐαὶ ἡμῖν, ὅτι κέκλικεν ἡ ἡμέρα, ὅτι ἐκλείπουσιν αἱ σκιαὶ τῆς ἑσπέρας.
**5.** Ἀνάστητε, καὶ ἀναβῶμεν ἐν νυκτί, καὶ διαφθείρωμεν τὰ θεμέλια αὐτῆς.
**6.** Ὅτι τάδε λέγει Κύριος· ἔκκοψον τὰ ξύλα αὐτῆς, ἔκχεον ἐπὶ Ἱερουσαλὴμ δύναμιν· ὦ πόλις ψευδῆς, ὅλη καταδυναστεία ἐν αὐτῇ.
**7.** Ὡς ψύγει λάκκος ὕδωρ, οὕτως ψύγει κακία αὐτῆς· ἀσέβεια καὶ ταλαιπωρία ἀκουσθήσεται ἐν αὐτῇ ἐπὶ πρόσωπον αὐτῆς διαπαντός· πόνος καὶ μάστιγι παιδευθήσῃ Ἱερουσαλήμ,
**8.** μὴ ἀποστῇ ἡ ψυχή μου ἀπὸ σοῦ, μὴ ποιήσω σε ἄβατον γῆν, ἥτις οὐ κατοικηθῇ.
**9.** Ὅτι τάδε λέγει Κύριος· καλαμᾶσθε, καλαμᾶσθε ὡς ἄμπελον τὰ κατάλοιπα τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, ἐπιστρέψατε χεῖρα ὡς ὁ τρυγῶν ἐπὶ τὸν κάρταλλον αὐτοῦ.
**10.** Πρὸς τίνα λαλήσω, καὶ διαμαρτύρωμαι, καὶ ἀκούσεται ; ἰδοὺ ἀπερίτμητα τὰ ὦτα αὐτῶν, καὶ οὐ δυνήσονται ἀκούειν· ἰδοὺ τὸ ῥῆμα Κυρίου ἐγένετο αὐτοῖς εἰς ὀνειδισμόν, καὶ οὐ μὴ βουληθῶσιν αὐτὸ ἀκοῦσαι.
**11.** Καὶ τὸν θυμόν μου ἔπλησα, καὶ ἐπέσχον, καὶ οὐ συνετέλεσα αὐτούς· ἐκχεῶ ἐπὶ νήπια ἔξωθεν, καὶ ἐπὶ συναγωγὴν νεανίσκων ἅμα, ὅτι ἀνὴρ καὶ γυνὴ συλληφθήσονται, πρεσβύτερος καὶ μετὰ πλήρους ἡμερῶν,
**12.** καὶ μεταστραφήσονται αἱ οἰκίαι αὐτῶν εἰς ἑτέρους, ἀγροὶ καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό· ὅτι ἐκτενῶ τὴν χεῖρά μου ἐπὶ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας τὴν γῆν ταύτην, λέγει Κύριος.
**13.** Ὅτι ἀπὸ μικροῦ αὐτῶν καὶ ἕως μεγάλου πάντες συνετέλεσαν ἄνομα, ἀπὸ ἱερέως καὶ ἕως ψευδοπροφήτου πάντες ἐποίησαν ψευδῆ,
**14.** καὶ ἰῶντο τὸ σύντριμμα τοῦ λαοῦ μου, ἐξουθενοῦντες καὶ λέγοντες, εἰρήνη, εἰρήνη· καὶ ποῦ ἐστιν εἰρήνη ;
**15.** κατησχύνθησαν, ὅτι ἐξέλιποσαν· καὶ οὐδ᾿ ὡς καταισχυνόμενοι κατησχύνθησαν, καὶ τὴν ἀτιμίαν αὐτῶν οὐκ ἔγνωσαν· διὰ τοῦτο πεσοῦνται ἐν τῇ πτώσει αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐν καιρῷ ἐπισκοπῆς αὐτῶν ἀπολοῦνται, εἶπε Κύριος.
**16.** Τάδε λέγει Κύριος· στῆτε ἐπὶ ταῖς ὁδοῖς, καὶ ἴδετε, καὶ ἐρωτήσατε τρίβους Κυρίου αἰωνίους· καὶ ἴδετε ποία ἐστιν ἡ ὁδὸς ἡ ἀγαθή, καὶ βαδίσατε ἐν αὐτῇ, καὶ εὑρήσετε ἀγνισμὸν ταῖς ψυχαῖς ὑμῶν· καὶ εἶπον· οὐ πορευσόμεθα.
**17.** Καθέστακα καὶ ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς σκοποὺς· ἀκούσατε τῆς φωνῆς τῆς σάλπιγγος,

**2** [Even] a sign that evils are poured out from the North, and a great destruction cometh to pass; and thy loftiness shall be taken away, O daughter of Zion.
**3** Unto her shall the shepherds make a noise, and their flocks; and they shall pitch tents against her round about, and each one shall feed [his flock] by his own hand.
**4** Prepare ye against her for war; arise ye, and let us go up against her at noonday. Woe unto us! for the day is far spent, for the shadows of the evening lengthen.
**5** Arise ye, and let us go up by night, and let us destroy her foundations.
**6** For thus saith the Lord: Cut down her trees, and cast up a mound against Jerusalem. O city of falsehood, she is wholly oppression within her.
**7** As a cistern keepeth water cold, so she keepeth her wickedness ever fresh; impiety and misery shall be heard in her upon her face continually. With pain and scourging shalt thou be chastised, O Jerusalem,
**8** lest My soul depart from thee, lest I make thee an uninhabitable land, which shall not be inhabited.
**9** For thus saith the Lord: Glean ye, glean ye as a vine the remnant of Israel; turn back thy hand as the grape-gatherer upon his basket.
**10** To whom shall I speak, and testify, that he may hear? Behold, their ears are uncircumcised, and they shall not be able to hear. Behold, the word of the Lord is become unto them a reproach, and they will not be willing to hear it.
**11** And I have been full of My wrath, yet I have restrained it, and have not made a full end of them. I will pour it out upon the infants abroad, and upon the assembly of young men together; for man and woman shall be taken captive, the elder, even he that is full of days.
**12** And their houses shall be turned over to others, their fields and their wives likewise. For I will stretch out My hand upon the inhabitants of this land, saith the Lord.
**13** For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them, all have committed lawlessness; from the priest even unto the false prophet, all have wrought falsehood.
**14** And they healed the breach of My people lightly, treating [it] with contempt, saying, "Peace, peace!" when there is no peace.
**15** Were they ashamed, because they had committed their abominations? Nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither did they know their own dishonor. Therefore shall they fall in their downfall, and in the time of their visitation they shall perish, saith the Lord.
**16** Thus saith the Lord: Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the ancient paths of the Lord; and see what is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find purification for your souls. But they said, "We will not walk therein."
