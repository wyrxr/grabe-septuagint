ΚΕΦ. ΛΕ΄. ΙΕΖΕΚΙΗΛ 1391
(φῃσὶ Κύριος.) Τάδε λέγει Κύριος Κύριος· ἐν τῇ εὐφροσύνῃ πάσης 14
τῆς γῆς ἔρημον ποιήσω σε. Καθὼς ηὐφράνθης εἰς κληρονομίαν 15
οἴκου Ἰσραήλ, ἔτι ἠφανίσθη, οὕτω ποιήσω σοι· ἔρημον ἔσῃ,
ὄρος Σηΐρ, καὶ πᾶσα ἡ Ἰδουμαία ἐξαναλωθήσεται, καὶ γνώσῃ,
ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς αὐτῶν.

ΚΕΦ. ΛΣ΄. XXXVI.

Καὶ σὺ υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, προφήτευσον ἐπὶ τὰ ὄρη Ἰσραήλ, 1
καὶ εἰπὸν τοῖς ὄρεσιν Ἰσραήλ· ἀκούσατε λόγον Κυρίου. Τάδε 2
λέγει Κύριος Κύριος· ἀνθ᾿ ὧν εἶπεν ὁ ἐχθρὸς ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς· εὖγε,
εὖγε, ἔρημα αἰώνια εἰς κατάσχεσιν ὑμῖν ἐγενήθη. Διὰ τοῦτο 3
προφήτευσον, καὶ εἰπόν· τάδε λέγει Κύριος Κύριος ὁ Θεός· ἀντὶ
τοῦ ἀτιμασθῆναι ὑμᾶς, καὶ μισθῆναι ὑμᾶς ὑπὸ τῶν ἐθνῶν τῶν
κύκλῳ ὑμῶν, τοῦ εἶναι ὑμᾶς εἰς κατάσχεσιν τοῖς καταλοίποις
ἔθνεσι, καὶ ἀνέβητε λάλημα γλώσσῃ, καὶ εἰς ὀνείδισμα ἔθνεσι, διὰ 4
τοῦτο, ὄρη Ἰσραήλ, ἀκούσατε λόγον Κυρίου Κυρίου· τάδε λέγει
Κύριος Κύριος· τοῖς ὄρεσι, καὶ τοῖς βουνοῖς, καὶ τοῖς χειμάῤῥοις,
καὶ ταῖς φάραγξι, καὶ ταῖς νάπαις ταῖς ἐρημωμέναις καὶ ἠραγισμέναις,
καὶ ταῖς πόλεσι ταῖς καταλελειμμέναις, αἱ ἐγένοντο
εἰς προνομήν, καὶ εἰς καταπάτημα τοῖς καταλειφθεῖσιν ἔθνεσι
τοῖς περικύκλῳ. Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Κύριος Κύριος· εἰ μὴν ἐν 5
πυρὶ θυμοῦ μου ἐλάλησα ἐπὶ τὰ λοιπὰ ἔθνη, καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν Ἰδουμαίαν
πᾶσαν, ὅτι ἔδωκαν ἑαυτοῖς τὴν γῆν μου εἰς κατάσχεσιν μετ᾿
εὐφροσύνης, ἀτιμάσαντες ψυχάς, τοῦ ἀφανίσαι ἐν προνομῇ. Διὰ 6
τοῦτο προφήτευσον ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ εἰπὸν τοῖς ὄρεσι,
καὶ τοῖς βουνοῖς, καὶ ταῖς φάραγξι, καὶ ταῖς νάπαις· τάδε λέγει
Ἀδωναὶ Κύριος· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐν τῷ ζήλῳ μου, καὶ ἐν τῷ θυμῷ μου
ἐλάλησα, ἀντὶ τοῦ ὀνειδισμοὺς ἔθνῶν ἐνέγκαι ὑμᾶς. Διὰ τοῦτο 7
ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ αἴρω τὴν χεῖρά μου ἐπὶ τὰ ἔθνη τὰ περικύκλῳ ὑμῶν,
οὗτοι τὴν ἀτιμίαν αὐτῶν λήψονται. Ὑμῶν δέ, ὄρη Ἰσραήλ, τὴν 8
σταφυλὴν καὶ τὸν καρπὸν ὑμῶν φάγεται ὁ λαός μου, ὅτι ἐγ-
γίζουσι τοῦ ἐλθεῖν. Ὅτι ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς, καὶ ἐπιβλέψω ἐφ᾿ 9
ὑμᾶς, καὶ κατεργασθήσεσθε, καὶ σπαρήσεσθε, καὶ πληθυνῶ ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς 10
ἀνθρώπους, πᾶν οἶκον Ἰσραὴλ εἰς τέλος, καὶ κατοικηθή-
σονται αἱ πόλεεις ὑμῶν, καὶ αἱ ἐρημωμέναι οἰκοδομηθήσονται.

**Chapter 35**

14 (Saith the Lord.) Thus saith the Lord, the Lord:
Amidst the joy of all the earth, I will make thee desolate.
15 As thou didst rejoice over the inheritance of the house of Israel,
even while it was laid waste, so will I do unto thee:
Desolate shalt thou be, O Mount Seir,
and all Idumaea shall be utterly consumed;
and thou shalt know that I am the Lord their God.

**Chapter 36**

1 And thou, son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel,
and say unto the mountains of Israel:
Hear the word of the Lord.
2 Thus saith the Lord, the Lord:
Because the enemy hath spoken against you, saying,
'Aha! Aha! The eternal desolate places are become our possession!'
3 Therefore prophesy and say:
Thus saith the Lord, the Lord God:
Because ye were dishonored,
and were hired by the nations round about you,
that ye should be a possession unto the remnant of the nations,
and ye became a byword upon the tongue,
and a reproach unto the nations;
4 therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord, the Lord:
Thus saith the Lord, the Lord:
To the mountains, and to the hills, and to the torrents,
and to the ravines, and to the valleys that are desolate and shattered,
and to the cities that are left,
which are become a prey and a trampling
to the nations that remain round about you.
5 Therefore thus saith the Lord, the Lord:
Surely, in the fire of My wrath have I spoken
against the rest of the nations, and against all Idumaea,
because they gave unto themselves My land for a possession with gladness,
having dishonored [the] lives [of men],
to utterly destroy it for a prey.
6 Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel,
and say unto the mountains, and unto the hills,
and unto the ravines, and unto the valleys:
Thus saith Adonai the Lord:
Behold, I have spoken in My jealousy and in My wrath,
because ye have borne the reproaches of the nations.
7 Therefore, behold, I lift up My hand
against the nations that are round about you;
these shall receive their own dishonor.
8 But as for you, O mountains of Israel,
My people shall eat your grapes and your fruit,
for their coming is nigh.
9 For behold, I am upon you,
and I will look upon you,
and ye shall be tilled, and ye shall be sown;
10 And I will multiply upon you men, even all the house of Israel completely;
and your cities shall be inhabited,
and your desolate places shall be built.
