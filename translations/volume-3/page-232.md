**11** Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτὸν Ἑλιακείμ, καὶ Σομνᾶς ὁ γραμματεύς, καὶ Ἰὼχ πρὸς Ῥαψάκην· λάλπσον δὴ πρὸς τοὺς παῖδας σου Συριστί· ἀκούομεν γὰρ ἡμεῖς· καὶ μὴ λάλει πρὸς ἡμᾶς Ἰουδαϊστί· καὶ ἵνατί λαλεῖς εἰς τὰ ὦτα τῶν ἀνδρῶν τῶν καθημένων ἐπὶ τῷ τείχει;
**12** Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτοὺς Ῥαψάκης· μὴ πρὸς τὸν κύριον ὑμῶν, ἢ πρὸς ὑμᾶς ἀπέσταλκέ με ὁ κύριός μου, λαλῆσαι τοὺς λόγους τούτους; οὐχὶ πρὸς τοὺς ἄνδρας τοὺς καθημένους ἐπὶ τῷ τείχει, ἵνα φάγωσι τὴν κόπρον καὶ πίωσιν οὖρον αὐτῶν μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν ἅμα;
**13** Καὶ ἔστη Ῥαψάκης καὶ ἐβόησε φωνῇ μεγάλῃ Ἰουδαϊστί, καὶ εἶπεν· ἀκούσατε τοὺς λόγους
**14** τοῦ βασιλέως τοῦ μεγάλου βασιλέως Ἀσσυρίων. Τάδε λέγει ὁ βασιλεύς· μὴ ὑμᾶς ἀπατάτω Ἑζεκίας λόγοις, οἷς οὐ μὴ δύνηται ῥύσασθαι ὑμᾶς·
**15** καὶ μὴ λεγέτω ὑμῖν Ἑζεκίας, ὅτι ῥύσεται ὑμᾶς ὁ Θεός, καὶ οὐ μὴ παραδοθῇ ἡ πόλις αὕτη ἐν χειρὶ βασιλέως Ἀσσυρίων·
**16** μὴ ἀκούετε Ἑζεκίου· τάδε λέγει ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων· εἰ βούλεσθε εὐλογηθῆναι, ἐκπορεύεσθε πρὸς μέ, καὶ φάγεσθε ἕκαστος τὴν ἄμπελον αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰς συκᾶς αὐτοῦ,
**17** καὶ πίεσθε ἕκαστος ὕδωρ τοῦ λάκκου ὑμῶν, ἕως ἂν ἔλθω, καὶ λάβω ὑμᾶς εἰς γῆν, ὡς ἡ γῆ ὑμῶν, γῆ σίτου καὶ οἴνου καὶ ἄρτων καὶ ἀμπελώνων.
**18** Μὴ ὑμᾶς ἀπατάτω Ἑζεκίας, λέγων· ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν ῥύσεται ἡμᾶς· μὴ ἐῤῥύσαντο οἱ θεοὶ τῶν ἐθνῶν,
**19** ἕκαστος τὴν ἑαυτοῦ χώραν ἐκ χειρὸς βασιλέως Ἀσσυρίων; Ποῦ ἐστιν ὁ Θεὸς Αἱμάθ καὶ Ἀρφάδ; καὶ ποῦ ὁ Θεὸς τῆς πόλεως Σεπφαρείμ; μὴ ἐδύναντο ῥύσασθαι Σαμάρειαν ἐκ χειρός μου;
**20** Τίς τῶν θεῶν πάντων τῶν ἐθνῶν τούτων, ὅστις ἐῤῥύσατο τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ ἐκ τῆς χειρός μου, ὅτι ῥύσεται ὁ Θεὸς τὴν Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐκ χειρός μου;
**21** Καὶ ἐσιώπησαν, καὶ οὐδεὶς ἀπεκρίθη αὐτῷ λόγον, διὰ τὸ προστάξαι τὸν βασιλέα μηδένα ἀποκριθῆναι αὐτῷ.
**22** Καὶ εἰσῆλθεν Ἑλιακεὶμ ὁ τοῦ Χελκίου ὁ οἰκονόμος, καὶ Σομνᾶς ὁ γραμματεὺς τῆς δυνάμεως, καὶ Ἰὼχ ὁ τοῦ Ἀσὰφ ὁ ὑπομνηματογράφος πρὸς Ἑζεκίαν ἐσχισμένοι τοὺς χιτῶνας, καὶ ἀπήγγειλαν αὐτῷ τοὺς λόγους Ῥαψάκου.

**Chapter 36**

**11** Then said Eliakim and Shebna the scribe, and Joah unto Rabshakeh, "Speak, I pray thee, unto thy servants in Syriac; for we do understand [it]; and speak not unto us in the Jewish [tongue]: for wherefore speakest thou into the ears of the men that sit upon the wall?"
**12** And Rabshakeh said unto them, "Hath my lord sent me to thy lord, or unto you, to speak these words? Is it not to the men who sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you together?"
**13** Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jewish [tongue], and said, "Hear ye the words
**14** of the great king, the king of the Assyrians. Thus saith the king: 'Let not Hezekiah deceive you with words, by which he shall not be able to deliver you;
**15** and let not Hezekiah say unto you, "God shall deliver you," and, "This city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of the Assyrians."
**16** Hark ye not unto Hezekiah; for thus saith the king of the Assyrians: "If ye be willing to be blessed, come ye forth unto me, and ye shall eat every man his own vine and his own fig trees,
**17** and drink ye every man the water of his own cistern, until I come and take you away unto a land like unto your own land, a land of corn and wine and bread and vineyards.
**18** Let not Hezekiah deceive you, saying, 'Our God shall deliver us.' Have the gods of the nations delivered,
**19** each one his own land from the hand of the king of the Assyrians? Where is the god of Hamath and Arphad? And where is the god of the city of Sepharvaim? Could they deliver Samaria from my hand?
**20** Which among all the gods of these nations hath delivered his own land from my hand, that God should deliver Jerusalem from my hand?"'
**21** But they held their peace, and no man answered him a word; for the king had commanded [them] that no man should answer him.
**22** And there came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe of the host, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, unto Hezekiah, having their clothes rent; and they reported unto him the words of Rabshakeh.
