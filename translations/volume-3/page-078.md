1016 ΨΑΛΤΗΡΙΟΝ. ΨΑΛΜ. ΡΒ´. ΡΓ´.
20 τοῦ πάντων δεσπόζει. Εὐλογεῖτε τὸν Κύριον πάντες οἱ ἄγγελοι
αὐτοῦ, δυνατοὶ ἰσχύϊ, ποιοῦντες τὸν λόγον αὐτοῦ, τοῦ ἀκοῦσαι τῆς
21 φωνῆς τῶν λόγων αὐτοῦ. Εὐλογεῖτε τὸν Κύριον πᾶσαι αἱ δυνάμεις
22 αὐτοῦ, λειτουργοὶ αὐτοῦ, ποιοῦντες τὸ θέλημα αὐτοῦ. Εὐλογεῖτε
τὸν Κύριον πάντα τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ ἐν παντὶ τόπῳ τῆς δεσποτίας
αὐτοῦ· εὐλόγει ἡ ψυχή μου τὸν Κύριον.

ΨΑΛΜ. ΡΓ´. CIII.

1 Τοῦ Δαυΐδ. Εὐλόγει ἡ ψυχή μου τὸν Κύριον· Κύριε ὁ Θεός
2 μου ἐμεγαλύνθης σφόδρα· ἐξομολόγησιν καὶ εὐπρέπειαν ἐνεδύσω,
ἀναβαλλόμενος φῶς ὡς ἱμάτιον, ἐκτείνων τὸν οὐρανὸν ὡσεὶ δέρριν.
3 Ὁ στεγάζων ἐν ὕδασι τὰ ὑπερῷα αὐτοῦ, ὁ τιθεὶς νέφη τὴν
4 ἐπίβασιν αὐτοῦ, ὁ περιπατῶν ἐπὶ πτερύγων ἀνέμων. Ὁ ποιῶν
τοὺς ἀγγέλους αὐτοῦ πνεύματα, καὶ τοὺς λειτουργοὺς αὐτοῦ πυρὸς
5 φλόγα. Ὁ θεμελιῶν τὴν γῆν ἐπὶ τὴν ἀσφάλειαν αὐτῆς· οὐ κλιθή-
6 σεται εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τοῦ αἰῶνος. Ἄβυσσος ὡς ἱμάτιον τὸ περιβό-
7 λαιον αὐτοῦ, ἐπὶ τῶν ὀρέων στήσονται ὕδατα· ἀπὸ ἐπιτιμήσεώς
8 σου φεύξονται, ἀπὸ φωνῆς βροντῆς σου δειλιάσουσιν· ἀναβαίνουσιν
ὄρη, καὶ καταβαίνουσι πεδία εἰς τόπον ὃν ἐθεμελίωσας αὐτοῖς·
9 ὅριον ἔθου ὃ οὐ παρελεύσονται, οὐδὲ ἐπιστρέψουσι καλύψαι τὴν
10 γῆν. Ὁ ἐξαποστέλλων πηγὰς ἐν φάραγξιν, ἀνὰ μέσον τῶν ὀρέων
11 διελεύσονται ὕδατα. Ποτιοῦσι πάντα τὰ θηρία τοῦ ἀγροῦ, προσ-
12 δέξονται ὄναγροι εἰς δίψαν αὐτῶν. Ἐπ᾽ αὐτὰ τὰ πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐ-
13 ρανοῦ κατασκηνώσει· ἐκ μέσου τῶν πετρῶν δώσουσι φωνήν. Πο-
τιοῦσι ὄρη ἐκ τῶν ὑπερῴων αὐτοῦ· ἀπὸ καρποῦ τῶν ἔργων σου
14 χορτασθήσεται ἡ γῆ. Ὁ ἐξανατέλλων χόρτον τοῖς κτήνεσι, καὶ
χλόην τῇ δουλείᾳ τῶν ἀνθρώπων, τοῦ ἐξαγαγεῖν ἄρτον ἐκ τῆς γῆς·
15 καὶ οἶνος εὐφραίνει καρδίαν ἀνθρώπου, τοῦ ἱλαρῦναι πρόσωπον ἐν
16 ἐλαίῳ· καὶ ἄρτος καρδίαν ἀνθρώπου στηρίζει. Χορτασθήσονται τὰ
17 ξύλα τοῦ πεδίου, αἱ κέδροι τοῦ Λιβάνου ἃς ἐφύτευσεν· ἐκεῖ στρου-
18 θία ἐννοσσεύσουσι, τοῦ ἐρωδιοῦ ἡ οἰκία ἡγεῖται αὐτῶν. Ὄρη τὰ
19 ὑψηλὰ ταῖς ἐλάφοις, πέτρα καταφυγὴ τοῖς λαγωοῖς. Ἐποίησε σε-
20 λήνην εἰς καιρούς· ὁ ἥλιος ἔγνω τὴν δύσιν αὐτοῦ. Ἔθου σκότος,
καὶ ἐγένετο νύξ· ἐν αὐτῇ διελεύσονται πάντα τὰ θηρία τοῦ δρυμοῦ·
21 σκύμνοι ὠρυόμενοι τοῦ ἁρπάσαι, καὶ ζητῆσαι παρὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ βρῶ-

**PSALM CII.** (continued)

20 ...His kingdom ruleth over all.
    Bless the Lord, all ye His angels,
    Mighty in strength, that do His word,
    [And] hearken unto the voice of His words.
21 Bless the Lord, all ye His hosts,
    Ye ministers of His, that do His pleasure.
22 Bless the Lord, all His works
    In all places of His dominion;
    Bless the Lord, O my soul.

**PSALM CIII.**

A Psalm of David.

1 Bless the Lord, O my soul!
    O Lord my God, Thou art become exceeding great!
2 Thou art clothed with praise and comeliness,
    Casting about Thee light as a garment,
    Stretching out the heaven as a curtain.
3 Who covereth His upper chambers with waters,
    Who maketh the clouds His chariot,
    Who walketh upon the wings of the winds.
4 Who maketh His angels spirits,
    And His ministers a flame of fire.
5 Who establisheth the earth upon her sure foundation,
    That it shall not be turned aside forever and ever.
6 The deep as a garment is its covering;
    Upon the mountains shall the waters stand.
7 From Thy rebuke shall they flee,
    From the voice of Thy thunder shall they be terrified.
8 Mountains ascend, and plains descend,
    Into the place which Thou didst establish for them.
9 Thou hast set a bound which they shall not pass,
    Neither shall they turn again to cover the earth.
10 Who sendeth forth springs in the valleys;
    The waters shall pass through the midst of the mountains.
11 They shall give drink to all the beasts of the field;
    The wild asses shall receive [water] for their thirst.
12 Beside them shall the birds of the air make their nests;
    From among the rocks shall they utter their voice.
13 He watereth the mountains from His upper chambers;
    From the fruit of Thy works shall the earth be satisfied.
14 Who causeth grass to grow for the cattle,
    And green herb for the service of men;
    To bring forth bread out of the earth:
15 And wine that maketh glad the heart of man,
    To make his face cheerful with oil;
    And bread which strengtheneth man's heart.
16 The trees of the plain shall be satisfied,
    The cedars of Lebanon which He hath planted;
17 There the sparrows shall nest;
    The house of the heron doth lead them.
18 The high mountains are for the deer,
    The rock a refuge for the conies.
19 He hath made the moon for seasons;
    The sun knoweth its going down.
20 Thou didst make darkness, and it became night;
    Therein shall all the beasts of the forest roam.
21 The young lions roaring to seize [their prey],
    And to seek from God their food.
