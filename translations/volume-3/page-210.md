ΚΕΦ. ΙΘʹ.
ὀδύνη καὶ πάντες οἱ τὸν ζύθον ποιοῦντες λυπηθήσονται, καὶ τὰς
11 ψυχὰς πονέουσι. Καὶ μωροὶ ἔσονται οἱ ἄρχοντες Τάνεως, οἱ σοφοὶ σύμβουλοι τοῦ βασιλέως, ἡ βουλὴ αὐτῶν μωρανθήσεται· πῶς ἐρεῖτε τῷ βασιλεῖ, υἱοὶ συνετῶν, ἡμεῖς υἱοὶ βασιλέων τῶν
12 ἐξ ἀρχῆς; Ποῦ εἰσι νῦν οἱ σοφοί σου, καὶ ἀναγγειλάτωσάν σοι; καὶ εἰπάτωσαν, τί βεβούλευται Κύριος Σαβαὼθ ἐπ᾿ Αἴγυπτον;
13 Ἐξέλιπον οἱ ἄρχοντες Τάνεως, καὶ ὑψώθησαν οἱ ἄρχοντες Μέμφεως, καὶ πλανήσουσιν Αἴγυπτον κατὰ φυλάς.
14 Κύριος γὰρ ἐκέρασεν αὐτοῖς πνεῦμα πλανήσεως, καὶ ἐπλάνησαν τὴν Αἴγυπτον ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς ἔργοις αὐτῶν, ὡς πλανᾶται ὁ μεθύων, καὶ ὁ ἐμῶν
15 ἅμα. Καὶ οὐκ ἔσται τοῖς Αἰγυπτίοις ἔργον, ὃ ποιήσει κεφαλὴν καὶ οὐρὰν, ἀρχὴν καὶ τέλος.
16 Τῇ δὲ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἔσονται οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι, ὡς γυναῖκες ἐν φόβῳ καὶ ἐν τρόμῳ ἀπὸ προσώπου τῆς
17 χειρὸς Κυρίου Σαβαώθ, ἣν αὐτὸς ἐπιβαλεῖ αὐτοῖς. Καὶ ἔσται ἡ χώρα τῶν Ἰουδαίων τοῖς Αἰγυπτίοις εἰς φόβητρον· πᾶς ὃς ἂν ὀνομάσῃ αὐτὴν αὐτοῖς, φοβηθήσονται διὰ τὴν βουλὴν Κυρίου Σαβαώθ, ἣν βεβούλευται Κύριος Σαβαώθ ἐπ᾿ αὐτήν.
18 Τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἔσονται πέντε πόλεις ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ λαλοῦσαι τῇ γλώσσῃ τῇ Χαναανίτιδι, καὶ ὀμνύουσαι τῷ ὀνόματι Κυρίου Σαβαώθ· πόλις ἀσεδὲκ κληθήσεται ἡ μία πόλις.
19 Τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἔσται τὸ θυσιαστήριον τῷ Κυρίῳ ἐν χώρᾳ Αἰγυπτίων, καὶ στήλη πρὸς τὸ ὅριον αὐτῆς
20 τῷ Κυρίῳ. Καὶ ἔσται εἰς σημεῖον εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα Κυρίῳ Σαβαώθ ἐν χώρᾳ Αἰγύπτου· ὅτι κεκράξονται πρὸς Κύριον διὰ τοὺς θλίβοντας αὐτοὺς, καὶ ἀποστελεῖ αὐτοῖς Κύριος ἄνθρωπον, ὃς σώσει αὐτοὺς, κρίνων σώσει αὐτοὺς,
21 καὶ γνωστὸς ἔσται Κύριος τοῖς Αἰγυπτίοις· καὶ γνώσονται οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι τὸν Κύριον ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, καὶ ποιήσουσι θυσίας καὶ δῶρον, καὶ εὔξονται εὐχὰς τῷ Κυρίῳ, καὶ ἀποδώσουσι.
22 Καὶ πατάξει Κύριος τοὺς Αἰγυπτίους πληγῇ μεγάλῃ, καὶ ἰάσεται αὐτοὺς ἰάσει, καὶ ἐπιστραφήσονται πρὸς Κύριον, καὶ ἐπακούσεται αὐτῶν, καὶ ἰάσεται αὐτούς.
23 Τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἔσται ὁδὸς ἀπὸ Αἰγύπτου πρὸς Ἀσσυρίους, καὶ εἰσελεύσονται Ἀσσύριοι εἰς Αἴγυπτον· καὶ Αἰγύπτιοι πορεύσονται πρὸς Ἀσσυρίους,
24 καὶ δουλεύσουσιν οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι τοῖς Ἀσσυρίοις. Τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἔσται Ἰσραὴλ τρίτος ἐν τοῖς Αἰγυπτίοις, καὶ ἐν τοῖς Ἀσσυρίοις
25 εὐλογημένος ἐν τῇ γῇ, ἣν εὐλόγησε Κύριος Σαβαώθ, λέγων· εὐλογη-

**Chapter 19**

**10** ...and they that devise these things shall be in anguish, and all they that brew strong drink shall be sorrowful, and their souls shall travail.
**11** Yea, the princes of Tanis shall become fools, and the wise counselors of the king; their counsel shall be made senseless. How then will ye say unto the king, "We are sons of the wise, and we are sons of kings from old"?
**12** Where now are thy wise men? Let them declare unto thee, and let them say, what the Lord of Hosts hath purposed concerning Egypt.
**13** The princes of Tanis have come to naught, and the princes of Memphis are become exalted; and they shall cause Egypt to stray, tribe by tribe.
**14** For the Lord hath mingled within them a spirit of delusion, and they have caused Egypt to stray in all her works, as a drunkard doth stagger and vomit at once.
**15** And there shall be no work for Egypt, which may avail for head or for tail, for beginning or for end.
**16** In that day shall the Egyptians be as women, [full] of fear and trembling, by reason of the hand of the Lord of Hosts,
**17** which He Himself shall stretch forth upon them. And the land of Judah shall be a terror unto the Egyptians; every one that shall make mention thereof unto them shall be afraid, because of the counsel of the Lord of Hosts, which the Lord of Hosts hath purposed concerning it.
**18** In that day there shall be five cities in Egypt that speak the tongue of Canaan, and swear by the Name of the Lord of Hosts; one city shall be called City Azedek.
**19** In that day shall there be an altar to the Lord in the land of Egypt, and a pillar at its border unto the Lord.
**20** And it shall be for a sign unto the Lord of Hosts, even for an everlasting [sign], in the land of Egypt; for they shall cry unto the Lord because of them that afflict them, and the Lord shall send them a man, who shall save them; [yea], by judging shall he save them.
**21** And the Lord shall be known unto the Egyptians; and the Egyptians shall know the Lord in that day, and shall offer sacrifices and gifts, and they shall vow vows unto the Lord, and shall perform them.
**22** And the Lord shall strike the Egyptians with a great plague, and He shall heal them with a healing; and they shall turn unto the Lord, and He shall hearken unto them, and shall heal them.
**23** In that day there shall be a highway from Egypt unto Assyria; and the Assyrians shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptians shall journey unto Assyria,
**24** and the Egyptians shall serve the Assyrians. In that day shall Israel be a third part among the Egyptians and among the Assyrians,
**25** blessed in the land, which the Lord of Hosts hath blessed, saying, "Blessed [be]..."
