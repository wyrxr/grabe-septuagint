ΚΕΦ. ΛΔ΄.
Ὁ γὰρ Θεός μου μέγας ἐστίν· οὐ παρελεύσεταί με Κύριος πατήρ, 22
Κύριος κριτὴς ἡμῶν, Κύριος ἀντιάττωρ ἡμῶν, Κύριος βασιλεὺς
ἡμῶν, Κύριος οὗτος ἡμᾶς σώσει. Ἐῤῥάγησαν τὰ σχοινία σου, 23
ὅτι οὐκ ἐνίσχυσαν· ὁ ἱστός σου ἔκλινεν, οὐ χαλάσει τὰ ἱστία,
οὐκ ἀρεῖ σημεῖον, ἕως οὗ παραδοθῇ εἰς προνομήν· τοίνυν πολλοὶ
χωλοὶ προνομήν ποιήσουσι, καὶ οὐ μὴ εἴπῃ, κοπιῶ, ὁ 24
λαὸς ὁ ἐνοικῶν ἐν αὐτοῖς, ἀφεθῇ γὰρ αὐτοῖς ἡ ἁμαρτία.

ΚΕΦ ΛΔ΄. XXXIV.

ΠΡΟΣΑΓΑΓΕΤΕ, ἔθνη, καὶ ἀκούσατε, ἄρχοντες προσέχετε· 1
ἀκουσάτω ἡ γῆ, καὶ οἱ ἐνοικοῦντες ἐν αὐτῇ, ἡ οἰκουμένη, καὶ
ὁ λαὸς ὁ ἐν αὐτῇ. Διότι θυμὸς Κυρίου ἐπὶ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη, 2
καὶ ὀργὴ ἐπὶ πάντα τὸν ἀριθμὸν αὐτῶν, τοῦ ἀπολέσαι αὐτούς,
καὶ παραδοῦναι αὐτοὺς εἰς σφαγήν. Οἱ δὲ τραυματίαι αὐτῶν ῥι- 3
φήσονται, καὶ οἱ νεκροὶ, καὶ ἀναβήσεται αὐτῶν ἡ ὀσμή, καὶ
βραχήσεται τὰ ὄρη ἀπὸ τοῦ αἵματος αὐτῶν· καὶ τακήσονται 4
πᾶσαι αἱ δυνάμεις τῶν οὐρανῶν, καὶ ἐλιγήσεται ὁ οὐρανὸς ὡς
βιβλίον, καὶ πάντα τὰ ἄστρα πεσεῖται ὡς φύλλα ἐξ ἀμπέλου·
καὶ ὡς πίπτει φύλλα ἀπὸ συκῆς. Ὅτι ἐμεθύσθη ἡ μάχαιρά 5
μου ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ· ἰδοὺ ἐπὶ τὴν Ἰδουμαίαν καταβήσεται, καὶ
ἐπὶ τὸν λαὸν τῆς ἀπωλείας μετὰ κρίσεως. Ἡ μάχαιρα Κυρίου 6
ἐνεπλήσθη αἵματος, ἐπαχύνθη ἀπὸ στέατος (ἀρνῶν) ἀπὸ αἵ-
ματος τράγων καὶ ἀμνῶν, καὶ ἀπὸ στέατος τράγων καὶ κριῶν·
ὅτι θυσία τῷ Κυρίῳ ἐν τῇ Βοσόρ, καὶ σφαγὴ μεγάλη ἐν τῇ
Ἰδουμαίᾳ, καὶ συμπεσούνται οἱ ἄδροι μετ᾽ αὐτῶν, καὶ οἱ κριοὶ 7
καὶ οἱ ταῦροι, καὶ μεθυσθήσεται ἡ γῆ ἀπὸ τοῦ αἵματος, καὶ
ἀπὸ τοῦ στέατος αὐτῶν ἐμπλησθήσεται. Ἡμέρα γὰρ κρίσεως 8
Κυρίου, καὶ ἐνιαυτὸς ἀνταποδόσεως κρίσεως Σιών. Καὶ στρα- 9
φήσονται αὐτῆς αἱ φάραγγες εἰς πίσσαν, καὶ ἡ γῆ αὐτῆς εἰς
θεῖον· καὶ ἔσται αὐτῆς ἡ γῆ καομένη ὡς πίσσα νυκτὸς καὶ 10
ἡμέρας, καὶ οὐ σβεσθήσεται εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα χρόνον, καὶ ἀνα-
θήσεται ὁ καπνὸς αὐτῆς ἄνω, εἰς γενεὰς ἐρημωθήσεται, καὶ
εἰς χρόνον πολύν· οὐκ ἔστιν ὁ παραπορευόμενος ἐν αὐτῇ. Καὶ 11
κατοικήσονται ἐν αὐτῇ ὄρνεα καὶ ἔχινοι, καὶ ἴβεις καὶ κόρακες·
καὶ ἐπιβληθήσεται ἐπ᾽ αὐτὴν σπαρτίον γεωμετρίας ἐρήμου, καὶ

**Chapter 33**
**22** For great is my God; the Lord [my] Father shall not pass me by, the Lord our Judge, the Lord our Defender, the Lord our King; this Lord shall save us.
**23** Thy ropes are broken asunder, for they were not strong; thy mast is bowed down, it shall not slacken the sails, it shall not raise a standard, until it be delivered up unto plunder. Therefore many lame men shall make plunder, and none shall say, 'I am weary.'
**24** The people that dwell among them, for their sin shall be forgiven them.

**Chapter 34**
**1** Draw near, O ye nations, and hearken; ye princes, give heed! Let the earth hear, and they that dwell therein, the inhabited world, and the people that are in it.
**2** For the wrath of the Lord is upon all the nations, and His indignation upon all their multitude, to utterly destroy them, and to deliver them to slaughter.
**3** And their slain shall be cast forth, and their dead; and their ill odour shall ascend, and the mountains shall be drenched with their blood.
**4** And all the powers of the heavens shall melt away, and the heaven shall be rolled up as a scroll; and all the stars shall fall as leaves from a vine, and as leaves falling from a fig tree.
**5** For My sword hath been made drunk in heaven; behold, it shall come down upon Idumea, and upon the people of perdition with judgment.
**6** The sword of the Lord is filled with blood; it is made fat with fat (of lambs), with the blood of goats and of lambs, and with the fat of goats and of rams.
**7** For there is a sacrifice unto the Lord in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in Idumea. And the stout rams shall fall together with them, both the rams and the bulls; and the land shall be made drunk with blood, and shall be filled with their fat.
**8** For it is the day of the Lord's judgment, and the year of recompense, [even] the judgment of Zion.
**9** And her valleys shall be turned into pitch, and her land into brimstone.
**10** And her land shall be burning as pitch night and day; and it shall not be quenched for evermore; and her smoke shall ascend upwards. For generations shall it be made desolate, and for a long season; there shall be none passing through it.
**11** And therein shall dwell birds and hedgehogs, and ibises and ravens; and upon it shall be cast the measuring line of desolation.
