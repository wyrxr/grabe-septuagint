ΚΕΦ. Ε΄. ς΄. ΙΕΖΕΚΙΗΛ 1335
σου εἰς πάντα ἄνεμον διασπερῶ αὐτοὺς, καὶ τὸ τέταρτόν
σου ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ πεσοῦνται κύκλῳ σου, καὶ μάχαιραν ἐκκενώσω
ὀπίσω αὐτῶν. Καὶ συντελεσθήσεται ὁ θυμός μου, καὶ ἡ ὀργή μου 13
ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς, καὶ ἐπιγνώσῃ, διότι ἐγὼ Κύριος λελάληκα ἐν τῷ
ζήλῳ μου, ἐν τῷ συντελέσαι με τὴν ὀργήν μου ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς. Καὶ 14
θήσομαί σε εἰς ἔρημον, καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας σου κύκλῳ ἐνώπιον
παντὸς διοδεύοντος, καὶ ἔσῃ στενακτὴ καὶ δειλαία τῇ παιδείᾳ 15
καὶ ἀφανισμῷ ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι τοῖς κύκλῳ σου, ἐν τῷ ποιῆσαί
με ἐν σοὶ κρίματα ἐν ὀργῇ καὶ ἐν θυμῷ καὶ ἐν ἐκδικήσει θυμοῦ μου·
ἐγὼ Κύριος λελάληκα. Ἐν τῷ ἐξαποστεῖλαί με τὰς βολίδας μου τοῦ 16
λιμοῦ ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς, καὶ ἔσονται εἰς ἔκλειψιν, καὶ συντρίψω στή-
ριγμα ἄρτου σου. Καὶ ἐξαποστελῶ ἐπὶ σὲ λιμὸν καὶ θηρία πονηρὰ, 17
καὶ τιμωρήσομαί σε, καὶ θάνατος καὶ αἷμα διελεύσονται ἐπὶ σὲ,
καὶ ῥομφαίαν ἐπάξω ἐπὶ σὲ κυκλόθεν· ἐγὼ Κύριος λελάληκα.

ΚΕΦ. ς΄. VI

ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς με, λέγων· υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου 1: 2
στήρισον τὸ πρόσωπόν σου ἐπὶ τὰ ὄρη Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ προφήτευσον ἐπ᾿
αὐτὰ, καὶ ἐρεῖς· τὰ ὄρη Ἰσραὴλ, ἀκούσατε λόγον Ἀδωναὶ Κυρίου· 3
τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναὶ Κύριος τοῖς ὄρεσι καὶ τοῖς βουνοῖς καὶ ταῖς νά-
παις καὶ ταῖς φάραγξιν· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐπάγω ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς ῥομφαίαν, καὶ
ἐξολοθρευθήσεται τὰ ὑψηλὰ ὑμῶν, καὶ ἀφανισθήσονται τὰ θυ- 4
σιαστήρια ὑμῶν, καὶ συντριβήσονται τὰ τεμένη ὑμῶν, καὶ κα-
ταβαλῶ τραυματίας ὑμῶν ἐνώπιον τῶν εἰδώλων ὑμῶν. Καὶ δώσω 5
τὰ πτώματα τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ κατὰ πρόσωπον τῶν εἰδώλων αὐ-
τῶν, καὶ διασκορπιῶ τὰ ὀστᾶ ὑμῶν κύκλῳ τῶν θυσιαστηρίων
ὑμῶν. Ἐν πάσῃ τῇ κατοικίᾳ ὑμῶν· αἱ πόλεις ἐξερημωθήσονται, 6
καὶ τὰ ὑψηλὰ ἀφανισθήσονται, ὅπως ἐξολοθρευθῇ τὰ θυσιαστή-
ρια ὑμῶν, καὶ συντριβήσονται τὰ εἴδωλα ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐξαρθήσεται
τὰ τεμένη ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐξαλειφθῶσι τὰ ἔργα ὑμῶν, καὶ πεσοῦνται 7
τραυματίαι ἐν μέσῳ ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐπιγνώσεσθε, ὅτι ἐγὼ Κύριος.
Καὶ ὑπολείψομαι ἐν τῷ γενέσθαι ἐξ ὑμῶν ἀνασωζομένους ἐκ 8
ῥομφαίας ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι, καὶ ἐν τῷ διασκορπισμῷ ὑμῶν ἐν
ταῖς χώραις. καὶ μνησθήσονταί μου οἱ ἀνασωζόμενοι ἐξ ὑμῶν ἐν 9
τοῖς ἔθνεσιν, οὗ ᾐχμαλωτεύθησαν ἐκεῖ· ὅτι ὀμώμοκα τῇ καρδίᾳ

### Chapter 5

**12** ...and thy fourth part will I scatter to every wind. And thy fourth part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and a sword will I draw out after them.
**13** And My wrath shall be completed, and My fury upon them; and thou shalt know that I, the Lord, have spoken in My jealousy, when I shall have accomplished My wrath upon them.
**14** And I shall make thee a desolation, and thy daughters round about [thee], before the sight of every passerby.
**15** And thou shalt be a lamentation and a dread, by reason of [thy] chastisement and destruction among the nations that are round about thee, when I shall execute in thee judgments in wrath and in fury and in vengeful anger: I, the Lord, have spoken.
**16** When I shall send forth My grievous arrows of famine upon them, and they shall be unto their consumption; and I shall break the staff of thy bread.
**17** And I shall send upon thee famine and evil beasts, and I shall take vengeance upon thee; and death and blood shall pass through thee, and a sword will I bring upon thee round about. I, the Lord, have spoken.

### Chapter 6

**1** And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying:
**2** Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,
**3** and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of Adonai the Lord! Thus saith Adonai the Lord to the mountains, and to the hills, to the vales and to the ravines: Behold, I bring a sword upon you, and your high places shall be utterly destroyed.
**4** And your altars shall be ruined, and your sacred groves shall be broken down; and I will cast down your slain before your idols.
**5** And I will lay the corpses of the sons of Israel before the face of their idols, and I will scatter your bones round about your altars.
**6** In all your dwelling places, the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be ruined; so that your altars may be utterly destroyed, and your idols broken down, and your sacred groves cut off, and your works wiped out.
**7** And the slain shall fall in your midst, and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
**8** Yet will I leave a remnant, when there shall be among you some that escape the sword among the nations, and when ye shall be scattered through the lands.
**9** And those who are saved from among you shall remember Me among the nations, where they were led captive; for I have sworn unto their heart
