**ΨΑΛΜ. ΡΚΔ´. CXXIV.**

Σιών· οὐ σαλευθήσεται εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα ὁ κατοικῶν Ἱερουσαλήμ.
**2** Ὄρη κύκλῳ αὐτῆς καὶ Κύριος κύκλῳ τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ, ἀπὸ τοῦ
νῦν καὶ ἕως τοῦ αἰῶνος. **3** Ὅτι οὐκ ἀφήσει τὴν ῥάβδον τῶν ἁμαρτωλῶν
ἐπὶ τὸν κλῆρον τῶν δικαίων, ὅπως ἂν μὴ ἐκτείνωσιν οἱ δίκαιοι ἐν ἀνομίᾳ
χεῖρας αὑτῶν. **4** Ἀγαθύνων Κύριε τοῖς ἀγαθοῖς, καὶ τοῖς εὐθέσι τῇ
καρδίᾳ. **5** Τοὺς δὲ ἐκκλίνοντας εἰς τὰς στραγγαλιὰς ἀπάξει Κύριος
μετὰ τῶν ἐργαζομένων τὴν ἀνομίαν· εἰρήνη ἐπὶ τὸν Ἰσραήλ.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ΡΚΕ´. CXXV.**

**ὨΔΗ τῶν ἀναβαθμῶν.**
**1** Ἐν τῷ ἐπιστρέψαι Κύριον τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν Σιών, ἐγενήθημεν
ὡς παρακεκλημένοι. **2** Τότε ἐπλήσθη χαρᾶς τὸ στόμα ἡμῶν, καὶ ἡ
γλῶσσα ἡμῶν ἀγαλλιάσεως· τότε ἐροῦσιν ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν· ἐμεγάλυνε
Κύριος τοῦ ποιῆσαι μετ᾽ αὐτῶν. **3** Ἐμεγάλυνε Κύριος τοῦ ποιῆσαι μεθ᾽
ἡμῶν· ἐγενήθημεν εὐφραινόμενοι. **4** Ἐπίστρεψον Κύριε τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν
ἡμῶν, ὡς χειμάρρους ἐν τῷ Νότῳ. **5** Οἱ σπείροντες ἐν δάκρυσιν, ἐν
ἀγαλλιάσει θεριοῦσι· πορευόμενοι ἐπορεύοντο καὶ ἔκλαιον, αἴροντες τὰ
σπέρματα αὑτῶν· **6** ἐρχόμενοι δὲ ἥξουσιν ἐν ἀγαλλιάσει, αἴροντες τὰ
δράγματα αὑτῶν.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ΡΚϚ´. CXXVI.**

**ὨΔΗ τῶν ἀναβαθμῶν τοῦ Σαλομῶνος.**
**1** Ἐὰν μὴ ὁ Κύριος οἰκοδομήσῃ οἶκον, εἰς μάτην ἐκοπίασαν οἱ
οἰκοδομοῦντες αὐτόν· ἐὰν μὴ ὁ Κύριος φυλάξῃ πόλιν, εἰς μάτην ἠγρύπνησεν
ὁ φυλάσσων. **2** Εἰς μάτην ὑμῖν ἐστι τοῦ ὀρθρίζειν ἐγείρεσθαι μετὰ τὸ
καθῆσθαι, οἱ ἐσθίοντες ἄρτον ὀδύνης· ὅταν δῷ τοῖς ἀγαπητοῖς αὑτοῦ
ὕπνον. **3** Ἰδοὺ ἡ κληρονομία Κυρίου υἱοί, ὁ μισθὸς τοῦ καρποῦ τῆς
γασρός. **4** Ὡσεὶ βέλη ἐν χειρὶ δυνατοῦ, οὕτως οἱ υἱοὶ τῶν ἐκτετιναγμένων.
**5** Μακάριος ἄνθρωπος ὃς πληρώσει τὴν ἐπιθυμίαν αὑτοῦ ἐξ αὑτῶν·
οὐ καταισχυνθῶσιν, ὅταν λαλῶσι τοῖς ἐχθροῖς αὑτῶν ἐν πύλῃ.

**PSALM 124 (LXX 124).**

Sion: he that dwelleth in Jerusalem shall not be moved for ever.
**2** Mountains are round about her, and the Lord is round about His people,
   from this time forth and for evermore.
**3** For He will not suffer the rod of the ungodly to rest upon the lot of the righteous,
   lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.
**4** Do good, O Lord, unto those that are good, and to them that are upright in their heart.
**5** But as for those that turn aside unto their twisted ways,
   the Lord shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity:
   Peace [be] upon Israel.

**PSALM 125 (LXX 125).**

*A Song of Ascents.*
**1** When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion,
   we were as men comforted.
**2** Then was our mouth filled with joy, and our tongue with exultation:
   then said they among the nations, "The Lord hath magnified [His work] to do with them!"
**3** The Lord hath magnified [His work] to do with us; we became joyful.
**4** Turn again our captivity, O Lord, as the torrents in the South.
**5** They that sow in tears, shall reap in exultation.
   They went forth, going and weeping, bearing their seed[s];
**6** But they that come shall come with exultation, bearing their sheaves.

**PSALM 126 (LXX 126).**

*A Song of Ascents of Solomon.*
**1** Unless the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it;
   unless the Lord keep the city, he watcheth in vain that keepeth it.
**2** It is vain for you to rise up early, and to rise after ye have sat down,
   ye that eat the bread of sorrow; when He giveth His beloved sleep.
**3** Lo, children are the heritage of the Lord; and the fruit of the womb is His reward.
**4** As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the sons of those that are shot forth.
**5** Blessed is the man that shall fill his desire from them;
   they shall not be ashamed, when they speak with their enemies in the gate.
