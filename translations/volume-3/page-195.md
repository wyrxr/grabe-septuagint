ΚΕΦ. Ζ. Η ΣΑ Ι Α Σ. 1133
Κύριος Σαβαώθ· οὐ μὴ ἐμμείνῃ ἡ βουλὴ αὕτη, οὐδὲ ἔσται, ἀλλ᾽ ἡ 8
κεφαλὴ Ἀρὰμ Δαμασκοῦ, καὶ ἡ κεφαλὴ Δαμασκοῦ Ῥασεΐν· ἀλλ᾽
ἔτι ἑξήκοντα καὶ πέντε ἐτῶν, ἐκλείψει ἡ βασιλεία Ἐφραὶμ ἀπὸ
λαοῦ, καὶ ἡ κεφαλὴ Ἐφραὶμ Σομόρων, καὶ ἡ κεφαλὴ Σομόρων 9
υἱὸς τοῦ Ῥομελίου· καὶ ἐὰν μὴ πιστεύσητε, οὐδὲ μὴ συνῆτε. Καὶ 10
προσέθετο Κύριος λαλῆσαι τῷ Ἄχαζ, λέγων· αἴτησαι σεαυτῷ σημεῖον 11
παρὰ Κυρίου Θεοῦ σου εἰς βάθος ἢ εἰς ὕψος. Καὶ εἶπεν 12
Ἄχαζ· οὐ μὴ αἰτήσω, οὐδ᾽ οὐ μὴ πειράσω τὸν Κύριον. Καὶ εἶπεν 13
ἀκούσατε δὴ οἶκος Δαυΐδ· μὴ μικρὸν ὑμῖν ἀγῶνα παρέχειν ἀνθρώποις,
καὶ πῶς Κυρίῳ παρέχετε ἀγῶνα; Διὰ τοῦτο δώσει 14
Κύριος αὐτὸς ὑμῖν σημεῖον· ἰδοὺ ἡ παρθένος ἐν γαστρὶ ἕξει, καὶ
τέξεται υἱόν, καὶ καλέσεις τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ἐμμανουήλ· βούτυρον 15
καὶ μέλι φάγεται, πρὶν γνῶναι αὐτὸν προελέσθαι πονηρά, ἐκλέξασθαι
τὸ ἀγαθόν· διότι πρὶν γνῶναι τὸ παιδίον ἀγαθὸν ἢ κακόν, 16
ἀπειθεῖ πονηρία, τοῦ ἐκλέξασθαι τὸ ἀγαθὸν, καὶ καταλειφθήσεται
ἡ γῆ, ἣν σὺ φοβῇ, ἀπὸ προσώπου τῶν δύο βασιλέων. Ἀλλὰ ἐπάξει 17
ὁ Θεὸς ἐπὶ σὲ καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν λαόν σου καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον
τοῦ πατρός σου ἡμέρας, αἳ οὔπω ἥκασιν ἀφ᾿ ἧς ἡμέρας ἀφεῖλεν
Ἐφραὶμ ἀπὸ Ἰούδα τὸν βασιλέα τῶν Ἀσσυρίων. Καὶ ἔσται ἐν 18
τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ συριεῖ Κύριος μυίας, ὃ κυριεύει μέρους ποταμοῦ
Αἰγύπτου, καὶ τῇ μελίσσῃ, ἣ ἔστιν ἐν χώρᾳ Ἀσσυρίων· καὶ 19
ἐλεύσονται πάντες, καὶ ἀναπαύσονται ἐν ταῖς φάραγξι τῆς χώρας,
καὶ ἐν ταῖς τρώγλαις τῶν πετρῶν, καὶ εἰς τὰ σπήλαια, καὶ ἐπὶ
πᾶσαν ῥαγάδα καὶ ἐν παντὶ ξύλῳ. Ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ξυρήσει 20
Κύριος ἐν τῷ ξυρῷ τῷ μεγάλῳ καὶ μεμισθωμένῳ, ὃ ἐστιν πέραν
τοῦ ποταμοῦ βασιλέως Ἀσσυρίων, τὴν κεφαλὴν καὶ τὰς
τρίχας τῶν ποδῶν, ἔτι καὶ τὸν πώγωνα ἀφελεῖ. Καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῇ 21
ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ θρέψει ἄνθρωπος δάμαλιν βοῶν, καὶ δύο πρόβατα· καὶ 22
ἔσται ἐπὶ τοῦ πλεῖστον ποιεῖν γάλα, φάγεται βούτυρον, ὅτι βούτυρον
καὶ μέλι φάγεται πᾶς ὁ καταλειφθεὶς ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς. Καὶ 23
ἔσται ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἔσται πᾶς τόπος, οὗ ἐὰν ὦσι χίλιαι ἄμπελοι
χιλίων σίκλων, εἰς χέρσον ἔσονται, καὶ εἰς ἄκανθαν· μετὰ 24
βέλους καὶ τοξεύματος εἰσελεύσονται ἐκεῖ, ὅτι χέρσος καὶ ἄκανθα
ἔσται πᾶσα ἡ γῆ. Καὶ πᾶν ὄρος ἀροτριώμενον ἀροτριωθήσεται, 25
καὶ οὗ μὴ ἐπέλθῃ ἐκεῖ φόβος· ἔσται γὰρ ἀπὸ τῆς χέρσου καὶ ἀκάνθης
εἰς βόσκημα προβάτου, καὶ εἰς καταπάτημα βοός.

**7** ...Thus saith the Lord of Sabaoth:
"This counsel shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass;
**8** For the head of Aram is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rasein;
But yet within threescore and five years
Shall the kingdom of Ephraim cease from [being] a people;
**9** And the head of Ephraim is Somoron, and the head of Somoron is the son of Remaliah.
If ye will not believe, neither shall ye understand."
**10** Moreover the Lord spake again unto Ahaz, saying,
**11** "Ask thee a sign of the Lord thy God;
Ask it either in the depth or in the height above."
**12** But Ahaz said, "I will not ask, neither will I tempt the Lord."
**13** And He said, "Hear ye now, O house of David;
Is it not enough for you to weary men,
But will ye weary my God also?
**14** Therefore the Lord Himself shall give you a sign:
Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son,
And thou shalt call His name Emmanuel.
**15** Butter and honey shall He eat,
Before He knoweth to choose the evil, and to choose the good.
**16** For before the child shall know good or evil,
Wickedness shall be rejected, to choose the good;
And the land that thou fearest shall be forsaken by the face of the two kings.
**17** But God shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people,
And upon the house of thy father,
Days that have not come from the day that Ephraim removed from Judah the king of the Assyrians.
**18** And it shall come to pass in that day,
That the Lord shall hiss for the flies
That rule the borders of the river of Egypt,
And for the bee that is in the land of the Assyrians.
**19** And they shall come, all of them,
And shall rest in the ravines of the land,
And in the clefts of the rocks,
And in the caves, and upon every crevice,
And in every tree.
**20** In that day shall the Lord shave
With a great and hired razor,
Which is beyond the river, [even] with the king of the Assyrians,
The head, and the hair of the feet, and moreover the beard He shall take away.
**21** And it shall come to pass in that day,
That a man shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep;
**22** And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk they shall give,
That he shall eat butter;
For butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land.
**23** And it shall come to pass in that day,
That every place where there were a thousand vines [worth] a thousand shekels,
Shall become a wasteland and thorns.
**24** With arrows and with bows shall men come thither;
For all the land shall be a wasteland and thorns.
**25** And every mountain that is tilled shall be tilled;
And where no fear shall come there,
For from the wasteland and thorns it shall be for the pasture of sheep,
And for the treading of oxen.
