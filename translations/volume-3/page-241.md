**24** Ὑμῶν, ἐκ γῆς βδέλυγμα ἐξελέξαντο ὑμᾶς, ἐγὼ ἤγειρα τὸν
**25** ἀπὸ βορρᾶ, καὶ τὸν ἀφ᾿ ἡλίου ἀνατολῶν κλήσονται τῷ ὀνόματι
μου· ἐρχέσθωσαν ἄρχοντες, καὶ ὡς πηλὸς κεραμέως, καὶ ὡς κεραμεὺς καταπατῶν τὸν πηλόν, οὕτως καταπατηθήσεσθε.
**26** Τίς γὰρ ἀναγγελεῖ τὰ ἐξ ἀρχῆς, ἵνα γνῶμεν καὶ τὰ ἔμπροσθεν;
καὶ ἐροῦμεν, ὅτι ἀληθῆ ἐστιν· οὐκ ἔστιν ὁ προλέγων, οὐδ᾿ ἀκούων τοὺς λόγους ὑμῶν.
**27** ᾿Αρχὴν Σιὼν δώσω, καὶ Ἱερουσαλὴμ παρακαλέσω εἰς ὁδόν.
**28** ᾿Απὸ γὰρ τῶν ἐθνῶν, ἰδοὺ οὐδεὶς· καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν εἰδώλων αὐτῶν οὐκ ἦν ὁ ἀναγγέλλων· καὶ ἐὰν ἐρωτήσω αὐτοὺς πόθεν ἐστέ; οὐ μὴ ἀποκριθῶσί μοι.
**29** Εἰσὶ γὰρ οἱ ποιοῦντες ὑμᾶς, καὶ μάτην οἱ πλανῶντες ὑμᾶς.

ΚΕΦ. ΜΒ΄. XLII.

**1** ΙΑΚΩΒ ὁ παῖς μου, ἀντιλήψομαι αὐτοῦ· ᾿Ισραὴλ ὁ ἐκλεκτός μου, προσεδέξατο αὐτὸν ἡ ψυχή μου, ἔδωκα τὸ πνεῦμά μου ἐπ᾿ αὐτόν, κρίσιν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν ἐξοίσει,
**2** οὐ κοάσσεται, οὐδὲ ἀνήσει, οὐδὲ ἀκουσθήσεται ἔξω ἡ φωνὴ αὐτοῦ.
**3** Κάλαμον συντεθλασμένον οὐ συντρίψει, καὶ λίνον καπνιζόμενον οὐ σβέσει,
ἀλλὰ εἰς ἀλήθειαν ἐξοίσει κρίσιν,
**4** ἀναλάμψει, καὶ οὐ θραυσθήσεται, ἕως ἂν θῇ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς κρίσιν, καὶ ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι αὐτοῦ ἔθνη ἐλπιοῦσιν.
**5** Οὕτως λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεός, ὁ ποιήσας τὸν οὐρανόν, καὶ πήξας αὐτόν, ὁ στερεώσας τὴν γῆν, καὶ τὰ ἐν αὐτῇ, καὶ δοὺς πνοὴν τῷ λαῷ τῷ ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς, καὶ πνεῦμα τοῖς πατοῦσιν αὐτήν.
**6** ᾿Εγὼ Κύριος ὁ Θεός ἐκαλεσά σε ἐν δικαιοσύνῃ, καὶ κρατήσω τῆς χειρός σου, καὶ ἐνισχύσω σε, καὶ ἔδωκά σε εἰς διαθήκην γένους, εἰς φῶς ἐθνῶν,
**7** ἀνοῖξαι ὀφθαλμοὺς τυφλῶν, ἐξαγαγεῖν ἐκ δεσμῶν δεδεμένους, καὶ ἐξ οἴκου φυλακῆς καθημένους ἐν σκότει.
**8** ᾿Εγὼ Κύριος ὁ Θεός, τοῦτό μου ἐστὶ τὸ ὄνομα, τὴν δόξαν μου ἑτέρῳ οὐ δώσω, οὐδὲ τὰς ἀρετάς μου τοῖς γλυπτοῖς.
**9** Τὰ ἀπ᾿ ἀρχῆς ἰδοὺ ἥκασι, καὶ καινὰ ἐγὼ ἀναγγέλλω, καὶ πρὸ τοῦ ἀνατεῖλαι ἐδηλώθη ὑμῖν.
**10** Ὑμνήσατε τῷ Κυρίῳ ὕμνον καινόν· ἡ ἀρχὴ αὐτοῦ, δοξάζετε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ ἀπ᾿ ἄκρου τῆς γῆς· οἱ καταβαίνοντες εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν, καὶ πλέοντες αὐτήν, αἱ νῆσοι καὶ οἱ κατοικοῦντες αὐτάς.
**11** Εὐφράνθητι ἔρημος, καὶ αἱ κῶμαι αὐτῆς, ἐπαύλεις, καὶ οἱ κατοικοῦντες Κη-

#### Chapter 41

**24** ...[whence your work comes,] of yours; from the earth they have chosen you as an abomination.
**25** I have raised up one from the north, and from the rising of the sun
    shall they call upon My name.
    Let rulers come; and as the clay of the potter,
    and as a potter treading down the clay, so shall ye be trodden down.
**26** For who shall declare the things from the beginning,
    that we may know also the former things?
    And we shall say, "It is true."
    There is none that foretelleth, nor any that heareth your words.
**27** I shall give a beginning to Zion,
    and to Jerusalem shall I grant comfort for the way.
**28** For from among the nations, behold, there is none;
    and from among their idols was there none that declared [it].
    And if I should ask them, "Whence are ye?"
    they shall not answer Me.
**29** For they that make you are naught,
    and vain are they that lead you astray.

#### Chapter 42

**1** Jacob My servant, I shall uphold him;
    Israel, My chosen one, My soul hath received him;
    I have put My Spirit upon him;
    He shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.
**2** He shall not cry aloud, nor give up [His voice],
    nor shall His voice be heard abroad.
**3** A bruised reed shall He not break,
    and smoking flax shall He not quench;
    but unto truth shall He bring forth judgment.
**4** He shall shine forth, and shall not be crushed,
    until He shall set judgment on the earth;
    and in His name shall the Gentiles hope.
**5** Thus saith the Lord God,
    He that made the heaven, and fixed it;
    He that established the earth, and the things therein;
    and gave breath unto the people that are upon it,
    and spirit to them that tread upon it.
**6** I the Lord God have called thee in righteousness,
    and I will hold thy hand, and will strengthen thee;
    and I have given thee for a covenant of a race,
    for a light of the Gentiles;
**7** to open the eyes of the blind,
    to bring forth them that are bound out of prison,
    and them that sit in darkness out of the house of confinement.
**8** I am the Lord God, this is My name;
    My glory will I not give to another,
    nor My praises to graven images.
**9** The former things, behold, they are come to pass,
    and new things do I declare;
    and before they spring forth, it is made manifest unto you.
**10** Sing unto the Lord a new song;
    [let] His beginning [be praised], glorify His name from the ends of the earth,
    ye that go down to the sea, and sail upon it,
    the islands, and their inhabitants.
**11** Rejoice, O wilderness, and her villages,
    the homesteads, and they that dwell in Ke-[dar].
