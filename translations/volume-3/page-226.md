Θεὸν, ἵππων σάρκας, καὶ οὐκ ἔστι βοήθεια· ὁ δὲ
ζει τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς· καὶ κοπιάσουσι οἱ βοηθοῦντες,
4 καὶ πεσεῖται ὁ βοηθούμενος, καὶ ἅμα πάντες ἀπολοῦνται. Ὅτι
    οὕτως εἰπέ μοι Κύριος· ὃν τρόπον ἐὰν βοήσῃ ὁ λέων, ἢ ὁ σκύ-
    μνος ἐπὶ τῇ θήρᾳ ᾗ ἔλαβε, καὶ κεκράξῃ ἐπ᾿ αὐτῇ, ἕως ἂν
    ἐμπλησθῇ τὰ ὄρη τῆς φωνῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἡττήθησαν, καὶ τὸ
    πλῆθος τοῦ θυμοῦ ἐποίηθησαν, οὕτως καταβήσεται Κύριος Σα-
    βαὼθ ἐπιστρατεῦσαι ἐπὶ τὸ ὄρος τὸ Σιῶν, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ ὄρη αὐτῆς·
8 Ὡς ὄρνεα πετόμενα, οὕτως ὑπερασπιεῖ Κύριος Σαβαώθ, ὑπὲρ
    Ἱερουσαλὴμ ὑπερασπιεῖ, καὶ ἐξελεῖται, καὶ περιποιήσεται, καὶ
6 σώσει. Ἐπιστράφητε οἱ τὴν βαθεῖαν βουλὴν βουλευσάμενοι καὶ
7 ἄνομον υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ, ὅτι τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἀπαρνήσονται οἱ ἄν-
    θρωποι τὰ χειροποίητα αὐτῶν τὰ ἀργυρᾶ, καὶ τὰ χειροποίητα
8 τὰ χρυσᾶ, ἃ ἐποίησαν αἱ χεῖρες αὐτῶν ἁμάρτημα· καὶ πεσεῖ-
    ται Ἀσσοὺρ, οὐ μαχαίρᾳ ἀνδρὸς, οὐδὲ μαχαίρᾳ ἀνθρώπου κατα-
    φάγεται αὐτὸν, καὶ φεύξεται οὐκ ἀπὸ προσώπου μαχαίρας·
9 οἱ δὲ νεανίσκοι ἔσονται εἰς ἧττημα, πέτρᾳ γὰρ περιληφθήσον-
    ται ὡς χάρακι, καὶ ἡττηθήσονται, ὁ δὲ φεύγων ἁλώσεται·
    τάδε λέγει Κύριος· μακάριος ὃς ἔχει ἐν Σιὼν σπέρμα, καὶ
    οἰκείους ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ.

ΚΕΦ. ΛΒʹ. XXXII.

1 ἸΔΟΥ γὰρ βασιλεὺς δικαίως βασιλεύσει, καὶ ἄρχοντες μετὰ
2 κρίσεως ἄρξουσι. Καὶ ἔσται ὁ ἄνθρωπος κρύπτων τοὺς λόγους
    αὐτοῦ, καὶ κρυβήσεται ὡς ἀφ᾿ ὕδατος φερομένου· καὶ φανήσεται ἐν
3 Σιὼν ὡς ποταμὸς φερόμενος ἔνδοξος ἐν γῇ διψώσῃ. Καὶ οὐκέτι
    ἔσονται πεποιθότες ἐπ᾿ ἀνθρώποις, ἀλλὰ τὰ ὦτα δώσουσιν
4 ἀκούειν, καὶ ἡ καρδία τῶν ἀσθενῶν προσέξει τοῦ νοεῖν,
    καὶ αἱ γλῶσσαι αἱ ψελλίζουσαι ταχὺ μαθήσονται λαλεῖν εἰ-
5 ρήνην· καὶ οὐκέτι οὐ μὴ εἴπωσι τῷ μωρῷ ἄρχειν, καὶ οὐκέτι
6 οὐ μὴ εἴπωσιν οἱ ὑπηρέται σου, σίγα. Ὁ γὰρ μωρὸς μωρὰ
    λαλήσει, καὶ ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ μάταια ποιήσει, τοῦ συντελεῖν
    ἄνομα, καὶ λαλεῖν πρὸς Κύριον πλάνησιν, τοῦ διαφθεῖραι ψυ-
7 χὰς πεινώσας, καὶ τὰς ψυχὰς τὰς διψώσας κενὰς ποιῆσαι. Ἡ
    γὰρ βουλὴ τῶν πονηρῶν ἄνομα βουλεύεται, καταφθείραι ταπει-

**Chapter 31**
**3** God, [but] the flesh of horses, and there is no help. But He `zei` His hand upon them; and they that render aid shall labor,
**4** and he that is aided shall fall, and all together shall they perish. For thus spoke the Lord unto me: As when the lion roareth, or the young lion upon his prey which he hath seized, and crieth out upon it, until the mountains be filled with his voice, and they were put to flight, and the multitude of [their] wrath was wrought, so shall the Lord of Sabaoth come down to make war upon Mount Zion and upon her hills.
**8** As birds flying, so shall the Lord of Sabaoth defend; over Jerusalem shall He defend, and deliver, and preserve, and
**6** save. Return, ye who have counselled deep counsel and lawless, O sons of Israel; for in that day shall men deny
**7** their handmade [idols] of silver, and their handmade [idols]
**8** of gold, which their hands made [as] a sin; and Asshur shall fall, not by the sword of man, neither shall the sword of man devour him, and he shall flee not from the face of the sword.
**9** But the young men shall be for an overthrow; for they shall be taken by a rock as with a trench, and they shall be put to flight, and he that fleeth shall be caught. Thus saith the Lord: Blessed is he who hath seed in Zion, and kinsfolk in Jerusalem.

**Chapter 32**
**1** For behold, a King shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule with judgment.
**2** And the man shall be [one that] conceals his words, and he shall be hidden, as [a source] from flowing water; and he shall appear in Zion as a glorious river flowing in a thirsty land.
**3** And no longer shall they trust in men, but they shall give their ears to hear,
**4** and the heart of the weak shall attend to understand, and the stammering tongues shall swiftly learn to speak peace.
**5** And no longer shall they say to the foolish man, "Rule!" and no longer shall thy servants say, "Be silent!"
**6** For the foolish man shall speak foolish things, and his heart shall perform vain things, to commit lawless deeds, and to speak deceit against the Lord, to destroy souls that hunger,
**7** and to make empty the souls that thirst. For the counsel of the wicked deviseth lawless things, to corrupt the humble
