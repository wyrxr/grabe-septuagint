ΚΕΦ. ΛΗʹ. ΙΕΡΕΜΙΑΣ 1285
ρία περιελεύσονται ἄνθρωποι. Οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος· ἔτι ἐροῦσι τὸν 23
λόγον τοῦτον ἐν γῇ Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐν πόλεσιν αὐτοῦ, ὅταν ἀποστρέψω
τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν αὐτοῦ, εὐλογημένος Κύριος ἐπὶ δίκαιον ὄρος τὸ
ἅγιον αὐτοῦ. Καὶ οἱ ἐνοικοῦντες ἐν πόλεσιν Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐν πά- 24
σαις ταῖς πόλεσιν αὐτοῦ· ἅμα γεωργῷ, καὶ ἀρθήσεται ἐν ποιμνίῳ.
Ὅτι ἐμέθυσα πᾶσαν ψυχὴν διψῶσαν, καὶ πᾶσαν ψυχὴν πεινῶσαν 25
ἐνέπλησα. Διὰ τοῦτο ἐξηγέρθην, καὶ εἶδον, καὶ ὁ ὕπνος μου ἡδύς μοι 26
ἐγένετο. Διὰ τοῦτο ἰδοὺ ἡμέραι ἔρχονται, φησὶ Κύριος, καὶ σπερῶ 27
τὸν οἶκον Ἰσραὴλ καὶ τὸν οἶκον Ἰούδα, σπέρμα ἀνθρώπου καὶ
σπέρμα κτήνους. Καὶ ἔσται ὥσπερ ἐγρηγόρουν ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς ἐκτίλ- 28
λειν, καὶ κατασπᾶν, καὶ καθαιρεῖν, καὶ ἀπολλύειν, καὶ κακοῦν,
οὕτως γρηγορήσω ἐπ᾿ αὐτούς, τοῦ οἰκοδομεῖν καὶ καταφυτεύειν,
φησὶ Κύριος. Ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις οὐ μὴ εἴπωσιν, οἱ πατέρες 29
ἔφαγον ὄμφακα, καὶ οἱ ὀδόντες τῶν τέκνων ἡμωδίασαν. Ἀλλ᾿ ἕκαστος 30
ἐν τῇ ἁμαρτίᾳ αὐτοῦ ἀποθανεῖται, πᾶς ἄνθρωπος, καὶ
τοῦ φαγόντος τὸν ὄμφακα αἱμωδιάσουσιν οἱ ὀδόντες αὐτοῦ. Ἰδοὺ 31
ἡμέραι ἔρχονται, λέγει Κύριος, καὶ διαθήσομαι τῷ οἴκῳ Ἰσραὴλ
καὶ τῷ οἴκῳ Ἰούδα διαθήκην καινήν, οὐ κατὰ τὴν διαθήκην, ἣν 32
διεθέμην τοῖς πατράσιν αὐτῶν, ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ἐπιλαβομένου μου τῆς
χειρὸς αὐτῶν, ἐξαγαγεῖν αὐτοὺς ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, ὅτι αὐτοὶ οὐκ
ἐνέμειναν ἐν τῇ διαθήκῃ μου, κἀγὼ ἠμέλησα αὐτῶν, φησὶ Κύριος.
Ὅτι αὕτη ἡ διαθήκη, ἣν διαθήσομαι τῷ οἴκῳ Ἰσραὴλ μετὰ τὰς 33
ἡμέρας ἐκείνας, φησὶ Κύριος, διδούς νόμους μου εἰς τὴν διάνοιαν
αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπιγράψω αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ τὰς καρδίας αὐτῶν, καὶ ὄψομαι
αὐτούς, καὶ ἔσομαι αὐτοῖς εἰς Θεόν, καὶ αὐτοὶ ἔσονταί μοι εἰς
λαόν. Καὶ οὐ μὴ διδάξωσιν ἔτι ἕκαστος τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ, καὶ 34
ἕκαστος τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ, λέγων, γνῶθι τὸν Κύριον· ὅτι πάν-
τες εἰδήσουσί με ἀπὸ μικροῦ αὐτῶν ἕως μεγάλου αὐτῶν, φησὶ Κύ-
ριος· ὅτι ἵλεως ἔσομαι ταῖς ἀδικίαις αὐτῶν, καὶ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν
αὐτῶν οὐ μὴ μνησθῶ ἔτι. Ἐὰν ὑψωθῇ ὁ οὐρανὸς εἰς τὸ μετέω- 37
ρον, φησὶ Κύριος, καὶ ἐὰν ταπεινωθῇ τὸ ἔδαφος τῆς γῆς κάτω,
καὶ ἐγὼ οὐκ ἀποδοκιμῶ τὸ γένος Ἰσραήλ, φησὶ Κύριος, περὶ πάν-
των ὧν ἐποίησάν μοι. Οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος, ὁ δοὺς τὸν ἥλιον εἰς 35
φῶς τῆς ἡμέρας, ἀκριβείας σελήνης καὶ τὰ ἄστρα εἰς φῶς τῆς
νυκτός, καὶ κραυγὴν ἐν τῇ θαλάσσῃ, καὶ ἐβόμβησε τὰ κύματα αὐ- 36
τῆς, Κύριος Παντοκράτωρ ὄνομα αὐτῷ. Ἐὰν παύσωνται οἱ νόμοι

**JEREMIAH CHAPTER 38 [LXX] (Hebrew Chapter 31)**

**22** ...in which salvation shall encompass men.
Thus saith the Lord: "Yet shall they speak this word in the land of Judah, and in her cities, when I shall turn back their captivity: 'Blessed be the Lord upon His righteous, His holy mountain!'"
**24** And those dwelling in the cities of Judah, even in all her cities, [shall dwell] together with the husbandman; and [they] shall be raised up within the flock.
**25** For I have satiated every thirsty soul, and every hungry soul have I filled.
**26** For this cause I awoke, and I saw; and my sleep became sweet unto me.
**27** For this cause, behold, the days are coming, saith the Lord, and I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and the seed of beast.
**28** And it shall be, just as I watched over them to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to ruin, and to cause evil; so will I watch over them to build and to plant, saith the Lord.
**29** In those days they shall no more say, "The fathers ate sour grapes, and the teeth of the children were set on edge."
**30** But each one shall die for his own sin, every man; and the teeth of him that eats the sour grapes shall be set on edge.
**31** Behold, the days are coming, saith the Lord, and I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah,
**32** not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day that I took hold of their hand, to lead them out from the land of Egypt; for they did not remain in My covenant, and I neglected them, saith the Lord.
**33** For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord: "Giving My laws into their mind, and I will write them upon their hearts; and I will see them, and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to Me a people.
**34** And they shall no more teach each one his neighbor, and each one his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord;' for all shall know Me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them," saith the Lord; "for I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins will I remember no more."
**37** "If the heaven be exalted to its height," saith the Lord, "and if the foundation of the earth be humbled beneath, then will I not cast off the generation of Israel," saith the Lord, "concerning all the things which they have done unto Me."
**35** Thus saith the Lord, who gives the sun for a light of the day, the precision of the moon and the stars for a light of the night, and [who gives] a cry in the sea, and its waves roared; the Lord Almighty is His name.
**36** "If these ordinances cease from before My face," saith the Lord, "then shall the generation of Israel cease to be a nation before My face all the days," saith the Lord.
