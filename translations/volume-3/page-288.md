ΚΕΦ. Ζ´. ΙΕΡΕΜΙΑΣ

**21** σβεσθήσεται, (καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ὁ σβέσων.) Τάδε λέγει Κύριος· τὰ
    ὁλοκαυτώματα ὑμῶν συναγάγετε μετὰ τῶν θυσιῶν ὑμῶν, καὶ φάγετε κρέα·
**22** ὅτι οὐκ ἐλάλησα πρὸς τοὺς πατέρας ὑμῶν, καὶ οὐκ ἐνετειλάμην αὐτοῖς ἐν ἡμέρᾳ, ᾗ ἀνήγαγον αὐτοὺς ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου
**23** περὶ ὁλοκαυτωμάτων καὶ θυσιῶν. ᾿Αλλ᾿ ἢ τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο ἐνετειλάμην αὐτοῖς, λέγων· ἀκούσατε τῆς φωνῆς μου, καὶ ἔσομαι
    ὑμῖν εἰς θεόν, καὶ ὑμεῖς ἔσεσθέ μοι εἰς λαόν, καὶ πορεύεσθε ἐν
    πάσαις ταῖς ὁδοῖς μου, αἷς ἂν ἐντείλωμαι ὑμῖν, ὅπως ἂν εὖ ᾖ
**24** ὑμῖν. Καὶ οὐκ εἰσήκουσαν μου, καὶ οὐ προσέσχε τὸ οὖς αὐτῶν,
    ἀλλ᾿ ἐπορεύθησαν ἐν τοῖς ἐνθυμήμασι τῆς καρδίας αὐτῶν τῆς κακῆς, καὶ ἐγενήθησαν εἰς τὰ ὄπισθεν, καὶ οὐκ εἰς τὰ ἔμπροσθεν,
**25** ἀφ᾿ ἧς ἡμέρας ἐξῆλθον οἱ πατέρες αὐτῶν ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου,
    καὶ ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης· καὶ ἐξαπέστειλα πρὸς ὑμᾶς πάντας
    τοὺς δούλους μου, τοὺς προφήτας, ἡμέρας καὶ ὄρθρου, καὶ ἀπέστειλα, καὶ οὐκ εἰσήκουσαν μου,
**26** καὶ οὐ προσέσχε τὸ οὖς αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐσκλήρυναν τὸν τράχηλον αὐτῶν καὶ ἐκακοποίησαν ὑπὲρ τοὺς πατέρας αὐτῶν.
**27** Καὶ ἐρεῖς αὐτοῖς τὸν λόγον τοῦτον, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἀκούσωσί σου, καὶ καλέσεις αὐτούς, καὶ μὴ ἀποκριθῶσί σοι.
**28** Καὶ ἐρεῖς αὐτοῖς τὸν λόγον τοῦτον· τοῦτο τὸ ἔθνος ὃ οὐκ ἤκουσε
    τῆς φωνῆς Κυρίου, οὐδὲ ἐδέξατο παιδείαν, ἐξέλιπεν ἡ πίστις, καὶ
    ἐξῆρται ἐκ στόματος αὐτῶν.
**29** Κεῖρε τὴν κεφαλήν σου, καὶ ἀπόῤῥιπτε, καὶ ἀνάλαβε ἐπὶ χειλέων θρῆνον, ὅτι ἀπεδοκίμασε καὶ ἀπώσατο Κύριος τὴν γενεὰν τὴν ποιοῦσαν ταῦτα.
**30** Ὅτι ἐποίησαν οἱ υἱοὶ ᾿Ιούδα τὸ πονηρὸν ἐνώπιον ἐμοῦ, λέγει Κύριος· ἔταξαν τὰ βδελύγματα αὐτῶν ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ, οὗ ἐπικέκληται τὸ ὄνομά μου
    ἐπ᾿ αὐτόν, τοῦ μιᾶναι αὐτόν.
**31** Καὶ ᾠκοδόμησαν τὸν βωμὸν τοῦ Ταφέθ, ὅς ἐστιν ἐν φάραγγι υἱοῦ ᾿Εννὸμ, τοῦ κατακαίειν τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας αὐτῶν ἐν πυρί, ὃ οὐκ ἐνετειλάμην
    αὐτοῖς, οὐδὲ διενοήθην ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ μου.
**32** Διὰ τοῦτο ἰδοὺ ἡμέραι ἔρχονται, λέγει Κύριος, καὶ οὐκ ἐροῦσιν ἔτι, βωμὸς τοῦ Ταφέθ, καὶ φάραγξ υἱοῦ ᾿Εννὸμ, ἀλλ᾿ ἡ φάραγξ τῶν ἀνηρημένων·
    καὶ θάψουσιν ἐν τῷ (τάφῳ) Ταφέθ, διὰ τὸ μὴ ὑπάρχειν τόπον,
**33** καὶ ἔσονται οἱ νεκροὶ τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου εἰς κατάβρωμα πᾶσι τοῖς πετεινοῖς τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ τοῖς θηρίοις τῆς γῆς, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται
    ὁ ἀποσοβῶν.
**34** Καὶ καταλύσω ἐκ πόλεων ᾿Ιούδα καὶ ἐκ διόδων ῾Ιερουσαλὴμ φωνὴν εὐφραινομένων, καὶ φωνὴν χαιρόντων, φωνὴν νυμφίου, καὶ φωνὴν νύμφης, ὅτι εἰς ἐρήμωσιν ἔσται πᾶσα ἡ γῆ.

**21** be quenched, (and there shall be none to quench it.) Thus saith the Lord: Gather your burnt offerings together with your sacrifices, and eat ye [the] flesh.
**22** For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt concerning burnt offerings and sacrifices.
**23** But this word I commanded them, saying: "Hearken unto My voice, and I shall be your God, and ye shall be My people; and walk ye in all My ways, which I shall command you, that it may be well with you."
**24** But they hearkened not unto Me, nor inclined their ear; but walked in the imaginations of their evil heart, and turned to the backside, and not to the front,
**25** from the day that their fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt, even until this day. And I sent unto you all My servants, the prophets, daily and rising early, and I sent [them]; yet they hearkened not unto Me,
**26** nor inclined their ear; but stiffened their neck, and wrought evil beyond their fathers.
**27** Therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them, but they will not hearken unto thee; and thou shalt call them, but they will not answer thee.
**28** And thou shalt say unto them this word: "This is the nation that hath not hearkened unto the voice of the Lord [its God], nor received instruction; faithfulness hath perished, and is cut off from their mouth."
**29** Shear thine hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away; and take up a lamentation upon thy lips, for the Lord hath rejected and cast off the generation that doeth these things.
**30** For the children of Judah have done evil in My sight, saith the Lord; they have set their abominations in the house over which My Name is called upon it, to defile it.
**31** And they have built the high place of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into My heart.
**32** Therefore, behold, the days are coming, saith the Lord, that they shall no more say, "The high place of Tophet," nor "The Valley of the Son of Hinnom," but "The Valley of Slaughter." And they shall bury in Tophet (in the grave), for there shall be no [other] place,
**33** and the dead bodies of this people shall be for food unto all the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth; and none shall drive them away.
**34** Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem the voice of them that make merry, and the voice of them that rejoice, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride; for the whole land shall be laid waste.
