ΚΕΦ. Ηʹ. VΙΙΙ.

1 ΚΑΙ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς μέ· λάβε σεαυτῷ τόμον χάρτου καινοῦ
μεγάλου, καὶ γράψον εἰς αὐτὸν γραφίδι ἀνθρώπου, τοῦ ὀξέως προνομὴν
2 ποιῆσαι σκύλων, πάρεστι γάρ· καὶ μάρτυράς μοι ποίησον
πιστοὺς ἀνθρώπους, τὸν Οὐρίαν τὸν ἱερέα καὶ τὸν Ζαχαρίαν
3 υἱὸν Βαραχίου. Καὶ προσῆλθον πρὸς τὴν προφῆτιν, καὶ ἐν γαστρὶ
ἔλαβε, καὶ ἔτεκεν υἱόν. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριός μοι· κάλεσον τὸ ὄνομα
4 αὐτοῦ, Ταχέως σκύλευσον, ὀξέως προνόμευσον. Διότι πρὶν γνῶναι
τὸ παιδίον καλεῖν πατέρα ἢ μητέρα, λήψεται τὴν δύναμιν Δαμασκοῦ,
5 καὶ τὰ σκῦλα Σαμαρείας ἔναντι βασιλέως Ἀσσυρίων. Καὶ
6 προσέθετο Κύριος λαλῆσαί μοι ἔτι, λέγων· διὰ τὸ μὴ βούλεσθαι
τὸν λαὸν τοῦτον τὸ ὕδωρ τοῦ Σιλωὰμ τὸ πορευόμενον ἡσυχῇ,
ἀλλὰ βούλεσθαι ἔχειν τὸν Ῥασσὼν καὶ τὸν υἱὸν Ῥομελίου βασιλέα
7 ἐφ᾿ ὑμῶν, διὰ τοῦτο ἰδοὺ ἀνάγει Κύριος ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς τὸ ὕδωρ τοῦ
ποταμοῦ τὸ ἰσχυρὸν καὶ τὸ πολύ, τὸν βασιλέα τῶν Ἀσσυρίων,
καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν δόξαν αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἀναβήσεται ἐπὶ πᾶσαν φάραγγα
8 ὑμῶν, καὶ περιπατήσει ἐπὶ πᾶν τεῖχος ὑμῶν, καὶ ἀφελεῖ ἀπὸ τῆς Ἰδαίας
ἄνθρωπον, ὃς δυνήσεται κεφαλὴν ἆραι, ἢ δυνατὸν συντελέσαι
τι· καὶ ἔσται ἡ παρεμβολὴ αὐτοῦ, ὥστε πληρῶσαι τὸ πλάτος τῆς
χώρας σου, μεθ᾿ ἡμῶν ὁ Θεός.
9 Γνῶτε, ἔθνη, καὶ ἡττᾶσθε, ἐπακούσετε ἕως ἐσχάτου τῆς γῆς.
ἰσχύοντες ἡττᾶσθε· ἐὰν γὰρ
10 πάλιν ἰσχύσητε, πάλιν ἡττηθήσεσθε· καὶ ἣν ἂν βουλεύσησθε βουλὴν,
διασκεδάσει Κύριος, καὶ τὸν λόγον ὃν ἐὰν λαλήσητε, οὐ μὴ
11 ἐμείνῃ ἐν ὑμῖν, ὅτι μεθ᾿ ἡμῶν (Κύριος) ὁ Θεός. Οὕτως λέγει
Κύριος ὁ Θεός· τῇ ἰσχυρᾷ χειρὶ ἀπειθοῦσι τῇ πορείᾳ τῆς ὁδοῦ τοῦ
12 λαοῦ τούτου, λέγοντες· μήποτε εἴπητε σκληρόν· πᾶν γὰρ ὃ ἐὰν εἴπῃ
ὁ λαὸς οὗτος, σκληρόν ἐστι. Τὸν δὲ φόβον αὐτοῦ οὐ μὴ φοβηθῆτε,
13 οὐδὲ οὐ μὴ ταραχθῆτε· τὸν Κύριον τῶν δυνάμεων αὐτὸν ἁγιάσατε,
καὶ αὐτὸς ἔσται σου φόβος.
14 Καὶ ἐὰν ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ πεποιθὼς ᾖς, ἔσται σοι εἰς ἁγίασμα, καὶ οὐχ ὡς
λίθου προσκόμματι συναντήσεσθε αὐτῷ· οὐδὲ ὡς πέτρας πτώματι.
Οἱ δὲ οἶκοι Ἰακὼβ ἐν
15 παγίδι, καὶ ἐν κοιλάσματι ἐγκαθήμενοι ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ· διὰ τοῦτο
ἀδυνατήσουσιν ἐν αὐτοῖς πολλοί, καὶ πεσοῦνται καὶ συντριβήσονται,
καὶ ἐγγιοῦσι, καὶ ἁλώσονται ἄνθρωποι ἐν ἀσφαλείᾳ ὄντες·
16 τότε φανεροὶ ἔσονται οἱ σφραγιζόμενοι τὸν νόμον τοῦ μαθεῖν. Καὶ

**8**
**1** And the Lord said unto me, "Take thee a great new scroll of paper, and write therein with a man's pen to make a swift plunder of spoils, for it is at hand."
**2** "And make unto me faithful witnesses, Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Barachiah."
**3** And I went unto the prophetess, and she conceived, and bare a son. And the Lord said unto me, "Call his name, 'Swiftly Plunder, Swiftly Seize Booty.'"
**4** For before the child shall know to call 'Father' or 'Mother,' he shall take the power of Damascus and the spoils of Samaria before the king of the Assyrians.
**5** Moreover the Lord spake yet again unto me, saying,
**6** "Because this people refuseth the waters of Siloam that go softly, but rather desire to have Rasson and the son of Remaliah as king over you;
**7** Therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon you the strong and many waters of the river, [even] the king of the Assyrians, and all his glory.
And he shall go up over every valley of yours,
**8** And shall spread over every wall of yours,
And shall take away from Judea every man who can lift up his head,
Or is able to accomplish anything.
And his camp shall be, so as to fill the breadth of thy land, [even] 'God is with us.' "
**9** Know [this], O nations, and be ye vanquished;
Give ear, all ye from the uttermost parts of the earth.
Ye mighty ones, be vanquished; for if ye again be mighty, again shall ye be vanquished.
**10** And whatsoever counsel ye shall take, the Lord shall scatter it;
And the word which ye shall speak, it shall not stand among you, because God is with us (the Lord is God).
**11** Thus saith the Lord God, with a mighty hand, unto those who are disobedient to the way of this people, saying,
**12** "Lest ye say, 'It is harsh'; for whatsoever this people shall say, it is harsh."
"But their fear shall ye not fear, neither shall ye be troubled.
**13** Sanctify the Lord of hosts Himself, and He shall be your fear."
**14** "And if thou art trusting in Him, He shall be unto thee for a sanctuary;
And ye shall not meet Him as a stumbling stone, nor as a rock of a downfall."
But the houses of Jacob [shall be] in
**15** A snare, and as a hollow wherein they sit in Jerusalem.
Therefore many among them shall be weak, and shall fall and be broken,
And shall draw near, and men being in security shall be caught.
**16** Then shall those who seal the law unto learning be made manifest. And
