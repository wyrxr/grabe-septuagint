    1300 ΙΕΡΕΜΙΑΣ ΚΕΦ. ΜΕ΄.
    λαλῶν πρὸς αὐτοὺς κατὰ τοὺς λόγους τούτους· ὅτι ὁ ἄνθρωπος
    οὗτος οὐ χρησμολογεῖ εἰρήνην τῷ λαῷ τούτῳ, ἀλλ᾿ ἢ πονηρά.
    5 Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεύς· ἰδοὺ αὐτὸς ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν ὑμῶν· ἔτι οὐκ
    6 ἠδύνατο ὁ βασιλεὺς πρὸς αὐτούς. Καὶ ἔλαβον τὸν Ἰερεμίαν,
    καὶ ἐῤῥίφαν αὐτὸν εἰς τὸν λάκκον Μελχίου υἱοῦ τοῦ βασιλέως,
    ὃς ἦν ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ τῆς φυλακῆς, καὶ ἐχάλασαν αὐτὸν ἐν σχοι-
    νίοις εἰς τὸν λάκκον, καὶ ἐν τῷ λάκκῳ οὐκ ἦν ὕδωρ, ἀλλ᾿ ἢ
    7 βόρβορος, καὶ ἦν ἐν τῷ βορβόρῳ. Καὶ ἤκουσεν Ἀβδεμέλεχ ὁ Αἰ-
    θίοψ, ἀνὴρ εὐνοῦχος, καὶ αὐτὸς ἐν οἰκίᾳ τοῦ βασιλέως, ἔτι ἐδω-
    καν Ἰερεμίαν εἰς τὸν λάκκον· καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς ἦν ἐν τῇ πύλῃ
    8 Βενιαμείν, καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Ἀβδεμέλεχ πρὸς αὐτόν, καὶ ἐλάλησε
    9 πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα, καὶ εἶπε· Κύριε βασιλεῦ, ἐπονηρεύσαντο οἱ
    ἄνδρες οὗτοι ἃ ἐποίησαν Ἰερεμία τῷ προφήτῃ, (ἀποκτεῖναι τὸν
    ἄνθρωπον τοῦτον·) ὅτι ἐνέβαλον αὐτὸν εἰς τὸν λάκκον, καὶ
    ἀποθανεῖται ὑποκάτω αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ προσώπου τοῦ λιμοῦ, ὅτι οὐκ
    10 εἰσιν ἔτι ἄρτοι ἐν τῇ πόλει. Καὶ ἐνετείλατο ὁ βασιλεὺς τῷ Ἀ-
    βδεμέλεχ τῷ Αἰθίοπι, λέγων· λάβε εἰς τὴν χεῖρά σου ἀπ᾿ ἐν-
    τεῦθεν τριάκοντα ἀνθρώπους, καὶ ἀνάγαγε αὐτὸν ἐκ τοῦ λάκκου,
    11 ἵνα μὴ ἀποθάνῃ. Καὶ ἔλαβεν Ἀβδεμέλεχ τοὺς ἀνθρώπους, καὶ
    εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν τοῦ βασιλέως τὴν ὑπόγαιον, καὶ ἔλαβεν
    ἐκεῖθεν παλαιὰ ῥάκη καὶ παλαιὰ σχοινία, καὶ ἐῤῥίφεν αὐτὰ πρὸς
    12 τὸν Ἰερεμίαν εἰς τὸν λάκκον· καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτόν· Ἀβδεμέλεχ ὁ
    Αἰθίοψ· ταῦτα θὲς τὰ παλαιὰ ῥάκη καὶ τὰ Μαλεεὶν ὑπὸ τοὺς
    ἀγκῶνας τῶν χειρῶν σου ὑποκάτω τῶν σχοινίων, καὶ ἐποίησεν
    13 Ἰερεμίας οὕτως. Καὶ εἵλκυσαν αὐτὸν ἐν τοῖς σχοινίοις, καὶ
    ἀνήγαγον αὐτὸν ἐκ τοῦ λάκκου· καὶ ἐκάθισεν Ἰερεμίας ἐν αὐλῇ
    14 τῆς φυλακῆς, καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ὁ βασιλεύς, καὶ ἐκάλεσεν αὐτὸν
    πρὸς ἑαυτὸν εἰς οἰκίαν Ἀσελεισήλ, τὴν ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου· καὶ εἶ-
    πεν αὐτῷ ὁ βασιλεύς· ἐρωτήσω σε λόγον, καὶ μὴ κρύψῃς ἀπ᾿
    15 ἐμοῦ ῥῆμα. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰερεμίας τῷ βασιλεῖ· ἐὰν ἀναγγείλω
    σοι, οὐχὶ θανάτῳ θανατώσεις με; καὶ ἐὰν συμβουλεύσω σοι, οὐ
    16 μὴ ἀκούσῃς. Καὶ ὤμοσεν αὐτῷ ὁ βασιλεὺς Σεδεκίας κρυ-
    φῇ, λέγων· Ζῇ Κύριος, ὃς ἐποίησεν ἡμῖν τὴν ψυχὴν ταύτην, εἰ
    ἀποκτενῶ σε, καὶ εἰ παραδώσω σε εἰς χεῖρας τῶν ἀνθρώπων
    17 τούτων, τῶν ζητούντων τὴν ψυχήν σου. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Ἰε-
    ρεμίας· οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος τῶν δυνάμεων ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ·

**JEREMIAH 45 (Septuagint) / JEREMIAH 38 (Hebrew)**

...speaking unto them according to these words; for this man prophesieth not peace unto this people, but only evil." **5** Then said the king, "Behold, he is in your hands;" yet the king could not prevail against them.

**6** So they took Jeremiah and cast him into the pit of Malchiah, the son of the king, which was in the court of the prison; and they let him down with ropes into the pit. Now in the pit there was no water, but only mire, and he was in the mire.

**7** Now Abdemelech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, who was himself in the king's house, heard that they had cast Jeremiah into the pit; and the king was in the gate of Benjamin. **8** And Abdemelech went forth unto him, and spake **9** unto the king, and said, "My lord the king, these men have wrought wickedly in all that they have done unto Jeremiah the prophet, (to slay this man); for they have cast him into the pit, and he shall die beneath it by reason of the famine, for there are no more loaves in the city."

**10** Then the king commanded Abdemelech the Ethiopian, saying, "Take into thine hand from hence thirty men, and bring him up out of the pit, that he die not." **11** So Abdemelech took the men, and went into the house of the king, into the inner chamber beneath, and took thence old rags and old ropes, and cast them unto **12** Jeremiah into the pit; and Abdemelech the Ethiopian said unto him, "These old rags and the Malein, put them under the joints of thine hands, beneath the ropes." And **13** Jeremiah did so. So they drew him up with the ropes, and brought him up out of the pit; and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.

**14** Then the king sent and called him unto himself, into the house of Aseleisel, which was in the house of the Lord; and the king said unto him, "I will ask thee a word, and hide thou nothing from **15** me a word." And Jeremiah said unto the king, "If I declare [it] unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? And if I give thee counsel, thou wilt not hearken unto me." **16** So King Zedekiah swore unto him secretly, saying, "As the Lord liveth, who hath made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I deliver thee into the hands of these men who seek thy life."

**17** Then Jeremiah said unto him, "Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel:
