ΚΕΦ. ΙΓʹ. ΙΔʹ. ΖΑΧΑΡΙΑΣ 1527
κίμῳ αὐτοῖς, ὡς δοκιμάζεται τὸ χρυσίον· αὐτὸς ἐπικαλέσεται τὸ
ὄνομά μου, καὶ ἐγὼ ἐπακούσομαι αὐτῷ, καὶ ἐρῶ, λαός μου οὗτός
ἐστι· καὶ αὐτὸς ἐρεῖ, Κύριος ὁ Θεός μου.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΔʹ. XIV.

ΙΔΟΥ ἡμέραι ἔρχονται τοῦ Κυρίου, καὶ διαμερισθήσονται τὰ 1
σκῦλα σου ἐν σοί· καὶ ἐπισυνάξω πάντα τὰ ἔθνη ἐπὶ Ἱερουσαλὴμ 2
εἰς πόλεμον, καὶ ἁλώσεται ἡ πόλις, καὶ διαρπαγήσονται αἱ οἰκίαι,
καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες μολυνθήσονται· καὶ ἐξελεύσεται τὸ ἥμισυ τῆς πό-
λεως ἐν αἰχμαλωσίᾳ, οἱ δὲ κατάλοιποι τοῦ λαοῦ μου οὐ μὴ ἐξο-
λευθῶσιν ἐκ τῆς πόλεως. Καὶ ἐξελεύσεται Κύριος, καὶ παρα- 3
τάξεται ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν ἐκείνοις, καθώς ἡμέρα παρατάξεως αὐτοῦ
ἐν ἡμέρᾳ πολέμου. Καὶ στήσονται οἱ πόδες αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ 4
ἐκείνῃ ἐπὶ τὸ ὄρος τῶν ἐλαιῶν, τὸ κατέναντι Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐξ ἀνα-
τολῶν· καὶ σχισθήσεται τὸ ὄρος τῶν ἐλαιῶν, τὸ ἥμισυ αὐτοῦ πρὸς
ἀνατολὰς, καὶ τὸ ἥμισυ αὐτοῦ πρὸς θάλασσαν, χάος μέγα σφό-
δρα· καὶ κλινεῖ τὸ ἥμισυ τοῦ ὄρους πρὸς βορρᾶν, καὶ τὸ ἥμισυ
αὐτοῦ πρὸς νότον· καὶ ἐμφραχθήσεται φάραγξ ὀρέων μου, καὶ ἐγ- 5
κολληθήσεται φάραγξ ὀρέων ἕως Ἀσαὴλ, καὶ ἐμφραχθήσεται, κα-
θὼς ἐνεφράγη ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις τοῦ σεισμοῦ ἐν ἡμέραις Ὀζίου βα-
σιλέως Ἰούδα· καὶ ἥξει Κύριος ὁ Θεός μου, καὶ πάντες οἱ ἅγιοι
μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἔσται ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ οὐκ ἔσται φῶς, καὶ 6
ψύχος καὶ πάγος· ἔσται μία ἡμέρα, καὶ ἡ ἡμέρα ἐκείνη γνωστὴ 7
τῷ Κυρίῳ, καὶ οὐχ ἡμέρα, καὶ οὐ νὺξ, καὶ πρὸς ἑσπέραν ἔσται
φῶς. Καὶ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἐξελεύσεται ὕδωρ ζῶν ἐξ Ἱερουσα- 8
λὴμ, τὸ ἥμισυ αὐτοῦ εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν τὴν πρώτην, καὶ τὸ ἥμι-
συ αὐτοῦ εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν τὴν ἐσχάτην· καὶ ἐν θέρει καὶ ἐν ἔαρι
ἔσται οὕτως. Καὶ ἔσται Κύριος εἰς βασιλέα ἐπὶ πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν· 9
ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἔσται Κύριος εἷς, καὶ τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ ἕν.
Κυκλῶν πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν, καὶ τὴν ἔρημον ἀπὸ Γαβεὲ ἕως Ῥεμ- 10
μὼν κατὰ νότον Ἱερουσαλήμ· Ῥαμὰ δὲ ἐπὶ τόπου μενεῖ, ἀπὸ
τῆς πύλης Βενιαμεὶν ἕως τοῦ τόπου τῆς πύλης τῆς πρώτης,
ἕως τῆς πύλης γωνιῶν, καὶ ἕως τοῦ πύργου Ἀναμεὴλ, καὶ
ἕως τῶν ὑποληνίων τοῦ βασιλέως· κατοικήσουσιν ἐν αὐτῇ, καὶ 11
οὐκ ἔσται ἀνάθεμα ἔτι, καὶ κατοικήσει Ἱερουσαλὴμ πεποιθότως.

**Zechariah [Chapter] 13**

**9** ...and I will test them by *kimos*, as gold is tested. He shall call upon My Name, and I will hearken unto him; and I will say, "This is My people," and he shall say, "The Lord is my God!"

**Zechariah [Chapter] 14**

**1** Behold, the days of the Lord are coming, and thy spoil shall be divided within thee.
**2** For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city shall be taken, and the houses plundered, and the women defiled. And half of the city shall go forth into captivity; but the remnant of My people shall not be utterly destroyed from the city.
**3** And the Lord shall go forth, and shall fight against those nations, as when He fought in the day of battle.
**4** And His feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east. And the Mount of Olives shall be split in two, half of it toward the east and half of it toward the west, [forming] a very great chasm. And half of the mountain shall incline toward the north, and half of it toward the south.
**5** And the valley of My mountains shall be stopped up; yea, the valley of the mountains shall be joined together even unto Asael, and it shall be stopped up, as it was stopped up in the days of the earthquake, in the days of Uzziah, king of Judah. And the Lord my God shall come, and all the saints with Him.
**6** And it shall come to pass in that day, there shall be no light, nor cold, nor frost.
**7** It shall be one day, and that day shall be known to the Lord; neither day, nor night, and toward evening there shall be light.
**8** And it shall come to pass in that day, living waters shall go forth from Jerusalem; half of them to the eastern sea, and half of them to the western sea. And it shall be so in summer and in spring.
**9** And the Lord shall be King over all the earth. In that day shall the Lord be one, and His Name one.
**10** Encompassing all the land, even the wilderness from Geba unto Rimmon, southward of Jerusalem. And Ramah shall remain in her place, from the Gate of Benjamin unto the place of the First Gate, unto the Corner Gate, and unto the Tower of Hananel, and unto the King's winepresses.
**11** They shall dwell therein, and there shall be no more an accursed thing; and Jerusalem shall dwell securely.
