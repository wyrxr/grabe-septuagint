**ΨΑΛΜ. ΟΖʹ.**
61 καὶ παρέδωκεν εἰς αἰχμαλωσίαν τὴν ἰσχὺν αὐτῶν, καὶ τὴν καλλονὴν
62 αὐτῶν εἰς χεῖρα ἐχθροῦ. Καὶ συνέκλεισεν εἰς ῥομφαίαν τὸν
63 λαὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὴν κληρονομίαν αὐτοῦ ὑπερεῖδε· τοὺς νεανίσκους
64 αὐτῶν κατέφαγε πῦρ, καὶ αἱ παρθένοι αὐτῶν οὐκ ἐπενθήθησαν· οἱ
    ἱερεῖς αὐτῶν ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ ἔπεσον, καὶ αἱ χῆραι αὐτῶν οὐ κλαυθήσονται.
65 Καὶ ἐξηγέρθη ὡς ὁ ὑπνῶν Κύριος, ὡς δυνατὸς κεκριπαληκὼς
66 ἐξ οἴνου· καὶ ἐπάταξε τοὺς ἐχθροὺς αὐτοῦ εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω, ὄνειδος
67 αἰώνιον ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς. Καὶ ἀπώσατο τὸ σκήνωμα Ἰωσήφ, καὶ τὴν
68 φυλὴν Ἐφραΐμ οὐκ ἐξελέξατο· καὶ ἐξελέξατο τὴν φυλὴν Ἰούδα,
69 τὸ ὄρος τὸ Σιὼν ὃ ἠγάπησε. Καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν ὡς μονοκερώτων τὸ
70 ἁγίασμα αὐτοῦ· ἐν τῇ γῇ ἐθεμελίωσεν αὐτὴν εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα. Καὶ
    ἐξελέξατο Δαυΐδ τὸν δοῦλον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀνέλαβεν αὐτὸν ἐκ τῶν
71 ποιμνίων τῶν προβάτων· ἐξόπισθεν τῶν λοχευομένων ἔλαβεν αὐτὸν,
    ποιμαίνειν Ἰακὼβ τὸν δοῦλον αὐτοῦ, καὶ Ἰσραὴλ τὴν κληρονομίαν
72 αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐποίμανεν αὐτοὺς ἐν τῇ ἀκακίᾳ τῆς καρδίας αὐτοῦ,
    καὶ ἐν ταῖς συνέσεσι τῶν χειρῶν αὐτοῦ ὡδήγησεν αὐτούς.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ΟΗʹ. LXXVIII.**
1 ΨΑΛΜΟΣ τῷ Ἀσάφ. Ὁ Θεὸς ἦλθοσαν ἔθνη εἰς τὴν κληρονομίαν
    σου, ἐμίαναν τὸν ναὸν τὸν ἅγιόν σου, ἔθεντο Ἱερουσαλὴμ
2 εἰς ὀπωροφυλάκιον. Ἔθεντο τὰ θνησιμαῖα τῶν δούλων σου βρώματα
    τοῖς πετεινοῖς τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, τὰς σάρκας τῶν ὁσίων σου τοῖς
3 θηρίοις τῆς γῆς· ἐξέχεαν τὸ αἷμα αὐτῶν ὡς ὕδωρ κύκλῳ Ἱερουσαλὴμ,
    καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ θάπτων.
4 Ἐγενήθημεν (εἰς) ὄνειδος τοῖς γείτοσιν
    ἡμῶν, μυκτηρισμὸς καὶ χλευασμὸς τοῖς κύκλῳ ἡμῶν.
5 Ἕως πότε Κύριε ὀργισθήσῃ εἰς τέλος; ἐκκαυθήσεται ὡς πῦρ ὁ ζῆλός
6 σου; Ἔκχεον τὴν ὀργήν σου ἐπὶ τὰ ἔθνη τὰ μὴ ἐπεγνωκότα σε, καὶ
7 ἐπὶ βασιλείας αἳ τὸ ὄνομά σου οὐκ ἐπεκαλέσαντο· ὅτι κατέφαγον
    τὸν Ἰακὼβ, καὶ τὸν τόπον αὐτοῦ ἠρήμωσαν.
8 Μὴ μνησθῇς ἡμῶν
    ἀνομιῶν ἀρχαίων· ταχὺ προκαταλαβέτωσαν ἡμᾶς οἱ οἰκτιρμοί
9 σου, ὅτι ἐπτωχεύσαμεν σφόδρα. Βοήθησον ἡμῖν ὁ Θεὸς ὁ σωτὴρ
    ἡμῶν ἕνεκα τῆς δόξης τοῦ ὀνόματός σου, Κύριε, καὶ ῥῦσαι ἡμᾶς,
10 καὶ ἱλάσθητι ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις ἡμῶν ἕνεκα τοῦ ὀνόματός σου· μήποτε
    εἴπωσιν ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι· ποῦ ἔστιν ὁ Θεὸς αὐτῶν; καὶ γνωσθήτω
    ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν ἐνώπιον τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν ἡμῶν ἡ ἐκδίκησις.

**PSALM LXXVII.**

61 And He delivered their strength into captivity,
And their beauty into the hand of the foe.
62 Yea, He delivered His people unto the sword,
And His inheritance did He abandon.
63 Their young men did the fire devour,
And their virgins were not lamented.
64 Their priests fell by the sword,
And their widows shall not be wept for.
65 Then the Lord awoke as one out of sleep,
As a mighty man overcome by wine;
66 And He smote His enemies in the hinder parts;
He gave unto them an everlasting reproach.
67 Moreover He rejected the tabernacle of Joseph,
And the tribe of Ephraim He chose not;
68 But He chose the tribe of Judah,
The Mount Zion which He loved.
69 And He built His sanctuary as [that of] unicorns,
And upon the earth He established it forever.
70 And He chose David His servant,
And took him from the sheepfolds;
71 From behind the ewes with young did He take him,
That he might shepherd Jacob His servant,
And Israel His inheritance.
72 So he shepherded them according to the integrity of his heart,
And by the skillful understanding of his hands did he guide them.

**PSALM LXXVIII.**

1 A Psalm of Asaph.
O God, the nations are come into Thine inheritance;
They have defiled Thy holy temple;
They have made Jerusalem as a watchman's hut in a garden.
2 They have given the dead bodies of Thy servants as meat unto the fowls of the heaven,
And the flesh of Thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.
3 They have shed their blood like water round about Jerusalem,
And there was none to bury them.
4 We are become a reproach unto our neighbors,
A scorn and derision unto them that are round about us.
5 How long, O Lord? Wilt Thou be angry forever?
Shall Thy jealousy burn like fire?
6 Pour out Thy wrath upon the nations that have not known Thee,
And upon the kingdoms that have not called upon Thy Name.
7 For they have devoured Jacob,
And laid waste his dwelling place.
8 Remember not against us the iniquities of old;
Let Thy tender mercies speedily come upon us,
For we are brought very low.
9 Help us, O God of our salvation,
For the glory of Thy Name, O Lord, and deliver us,
10 And be merciful unto our sins for Thy Name's sake.
Lest at any time the nations should say, "Where is their God?"
And let the vengeance be known among the nations before our eyes.
