ΚΕΦ. ΙΒ΄. ΙΓ΄. ΙΕΖΕΚΙΗΛ 1345

τὸν λαὸν τῆς γῆς· τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναὶ Κύριος τοῖς κατοικοῦσιν Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς τοῦ Ἰσραήλ· τοὺς ἄρτους αὐτῶν μετ’ ἐνδείας φάγονται, καὶ τὸ ὕδωρ αὐτῶν μετὰ ἀφανισμοῦ πίονται, ὅπως ἀφανισθῇ ἡ γῆ σὺν τῷ πληρώματι αὐτῆς, ἐν ἀσεβείᾳ γὰρ πάντες οἱ κατοικοῦντες ἐν αὐτῇ. Καὶ αἱ πόλεις αὐτῶν αἱ κατοικούμεναι ἐξερημωθήσονται, καὶ ἡ γῆ αὐτῶν εἰς ἀφανισμὸν ἔσται, καὶ ἐπιγνώσεσθε, διότι ἐγὼ Κύριος. Καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς μέ, λέγων· Υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, τίς ὑμῖν ἡ παραβολὴ αὕτη ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, λέγοντες· μακρὰν αἱ ἡμέραι, ἀπόλωλε πᾶσα ὅρασις; Διὰ τοῦτο εἰπὸν πρὸς αὐτούς· Τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναὶ Κύριος· Ἀποστρέψω τὴν παραβολὴν ταύτην, καὶ οὐκέτι μὴ εἴπωσι τὴν παραβολὴν ταύτην οἶκος τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, ὅτι λαλήσεις πρὸς αὐτούς, ἤγγικασιν αἱ ἡμέραι, καὶ λόγος πάσης δράσεως. Ὅτι οὐκ ἔτι ἔσται πᾶσα ὅρασις ψευδής, καὶ μαντευόμενος τὰ πρὸς χάριν ἐν μέσῳ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ. Διότι ἐγὼ Κύριος λαλήσω τοὺς λόγους μου, λαλήσω καὶ ποιήσω, καὶ οὐ μὴ μηκύνω ἔτι· ἔτι ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ὑμῶν οἶκος ὁ παραπικραίνων· λαλήσω λόγον καὶ ποιήσω, λέγει Ἀδωναὶ Κύριος.

Καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς μέ, λέγων· Υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, ἰδοὺ ὁ οἶκος Ἰσραὴλ ὁ παραπικραίνων, λέγοντες λέγουσιν, ἡ ὅρασις ἣν οὗτος ὁρᾷ, εἰς ἡμέρας πολλὰς, καὶ εἰς καιροὺς μακροὺς οὗτος προφητεύει, διὰ τοῦτο εἰπὸν πρὸς αὐτούς, Τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναὶ Κύριος· Οὐ μὴ μηκύνωσιν οὐκέτι πάντες οἱ λόγοι μου, οὓς ἂν λαλήσω· ὅτι λαλήσω λόγον καὶ ποιήσω, λέγει Ἀδωναὶ Κύριος.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΓʹ. XIII.

ΚΑὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς μέ, λέγων· Υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, προφήτευσον ἐπὶ τοὺς προφήτας τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ, τοὺς προφητεύοντας, καὶ ἐρεῖς τοῖς προφήταις τοῖς προφητεύουσιν ἀπὸ καρδίας αὐτῶν, καὶ προφητεύσεις, καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτούς· ἀκούσατε λόγον Κυρίου. Τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναὶ Κύριος· οὐαὶ τοῖς προφητεύουσιν ἀπὸ καρδίας αὐτῶν, τοῖς πορευομένοις ἀπὸ τοῦ πνεύματος αὐτῶν, καὶ τὸ καθόλου μὴ βλέπουσιν. Οἱ προφῆται σου Ἰσραὴλ ὡσεὶ ἀλώπεκες ἐν ταῖς ἐρήμοις· οὐκ ἔστησαν ἐν στερεώματι· καὶ συνήγαγον ποίμνια ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ· οὐκ ἀνέστησαν οἱ λέγοντες ἐν ἡμέρᾳ Κυρίου, βλέποντες ψευδῆ, μαντευόμενοι μάταια, οἱ λέγοντες· τάδε

**19** the people of the land: "Thus saith Adonai the Lord unto them that dwell in Jerusalem, upon the land of Israel: Their bread shall they eat with scarcity, and their water shall they drink with desolation; that the land may be laid waste with the fulness thereof; for in ungodliness are all they that dwell therein.
**20** And their cities which are inhabited shall be laid waste, and their land shall become a desolation; and ye shall know that I am the Lord."
**21** Moreover, the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
**22** "Son of man, what [meaneth] this proverb unto you, concerning the land of Israel, saying, 'The days are prolonged, and every vision hath failed?'"
**23** "Therefore say unto them, 'Thus saith Adonai the Lord: I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more speak this proverb, [even] the house of Israel. For thou shalt speak unto them, "The days are at hand, and the word of every vision."
**24** For there shall be no more any false vision, nor any divining for favour in the midst of the children of Israel.
**25** For I am the Lord: I will speak My words; I will speak and perform [them], and I will no more prolong [them]. Yet in your days, O house that provoketh [Me to] bitterness, I will speak a word and will perform [it], saith Adonai the Lord.'"
**26** And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
**27** "Son of man, behold, the house of Israel, [even] the house that provoketh [Me to] bitterness, they speak, saying, 'The vision which this one seeth [is] for many days [to come], and for times far off this one prophesieth.'
**28** Therefore say unto them, 'Thus saith Adonai the Lord: All My words which I shall speak shall no more be prolonged; for I will speak a word, and will perform [it], saith Adonai the Lord.'"

### CHAPTER XIII

**1** And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
**2** "Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy; and thou shalt say unto the prophets that prophesy out of their own heart, yea, thou shalt prophesy, and say unto them, 'Hear ye the word of the Lord!'
**3** Thus saith Adonai the Lord: 'Woe unto them that prophesy out of their own heart, and to them that follow their own spirit, and see not [anything] at all!
**4** Thy prophets, O Israel, are as the foxes in the deserts.
**5** They stood not in the stronghold; yea, they gathered flocks upon the house of Israel. They did not rise up, [even] they that spoke in the day of the Lord, beholding false [visions], divining vain [things], those that said, 'Thus..."
