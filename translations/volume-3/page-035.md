**ΨΑΛΜ. ΜΗ´. ΜΘ´. ΨΑΛΤΗΡΙΟΝ. 973**
ψαλτηρίῳ τὸ πρόβλημά μου. Ἵνατί φοβοῦμαι ἐν ἡμέρᾳ πονηρᾷ, 6
ἡ ἀνομία τῆς πτέρνης μου κυκλώσει με. Οἱ πεποιθότες ἐπὶ τῇ δυ- 7
νάμει αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπὶ τῷ πλήθει τοῦ πλούτου αὐτῶν καυχώμε-
νοι. Ἀδελφὸς οὐ λυτρώνεται· λυτρώσεται ἄνθρωπος; οὐ δώσει 8
τῷ Θεῷ ἐξίλασμα αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὴν τιμὴν τῆς λυτρώσεως τῆς ψυχῆς 9
αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐκόπασεν εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα. Καὶ ζήσεται ἔτι εἰς τέλος, 10
(ὅτι) οὐκ ὄψεται καταφθοράν. Ὅταν ἴδῃ σοφοὺς ἀποθνήσκοντας, 11
ἐπιτοαυτὸ ἄφρων καὶ ἄνους ἀπολοῦνται, καὶ καταλείψουσιν ἀλ-
λοτρίοις τὸν πλοῦτον αὐτῶν. Καὶ οἱ τάφοι αὐτῶν οἰκίαι αὐτῶν 12
εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα· σκηνώματα αὐτῶν εἰς γενεὰν καὶ γενεάν, ἐπεκαλέ-
σαντο τὰ ὀνόματα αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τῶν γαιῶν αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἄνθρωπος 13
ἐν τιμῇ ὢν οὐ συνῆκε, παρασυνεβλήθη τοῖς κτήνεσι τοῖς ἀνοήτοις,
καὶ ὡμοιώθη αὐτοῖς. Αὕτη ἡ ὁδὸς αὐτῶν σκάνδαλον αὐτοῖς· καὶ 14
μετὰ ταῦτα ἐν τῷ στόματι αὐτῶν εὐδοκήσουσιν. Διάψαλμα. Ὡς 15
πρόβατα ἐν ἅδῃ ἔθεντο, θάνατος ποιμανεῖ αὐτούς· καὶ κατακυ-
ριεύσουσιν αὐτῶν οἱ εὐθεῖς τοπρωΐ, καὶ ἡ βοήθεια αὐτῶν παλαιω-
θήσεται ἐν τῷ ἅδῃ ἐκ τῆς δόξης αὐτῶν (ἐξώσθησαν). Πλὴν ὁ Θεὸς 16
λυτρώσεται τὴν ψυχήν μου ἐκ χειρὸς ᾅδου, ὅταν λαμβάνῃ με.
Διάψαλμα. Μὴ φοβοῦ ὅταν πλουτήσῃ ἄνθρωπος, ἢ ὅταν πληθυν- 17
θῇ ἡ δόξα τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ· ἔτι οὐκ ἐν τῷ ἀποθνήσκειν αὐτὸν λή- 18
ψεται τὰ πάντα, οὐδὲ συγκαταβήσεται αὐτῷ ἡ δόξα αὐτοῦ. Ὅτι 19
ἡ ψυχὴ αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ ζωῇ αὐτοῦ εὐλογηθήσεται· ἐξομολογήσεταί
σοι ὅταν ἀγαθύνῃς αὐτῷ. Εἰσελεύσεται ἕως γενεᾶς πατέρων αὐ- 20
τοῦ· ἕως αἰῶνος οὐκ ὄψεται φῶς. Καὶ ἄνθρωπος ἐν τιμῇ ὢν οὐ 21
συνῆκε, παρασυνεβλήθη τοῖς κτήνεσι τοῖς ἀνοήτοις, καὶ ὡμοιώθη
αὐτοῖς.

(Εἰς τὸ τέλος), Ψαλμὸς τῷ Ἀσάφ. Θεὸς θεῶν Κύριος ἐλά- 1
λησε, καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὴν γῆν, ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν ἡλίου (καὶ) μέχρι δυ-
σμῶν. Ἐκ Σιὼν ἡ εὐπρέπεια τῆς ὡραιότητος αὐτοῦ. Ὁ Θεὸς ἐμ- 2.3
φανῶς ἥξει, ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν, καὶ οὐ παρασιωπήσεται· πῦρ ἐναντίον
αὐτοῦ καυθήσεται, καὶ κύκλῳ αὐτοῦ καταιγὶς σφόδρα. Προσκαλέ- 4
σεται τὸν οὐρανὸν ἄνω, καὶ τὴν γῆν, τοῦ διακρῖναι τὸν λαὸν αὐ-
τοῦ. Συναγάγετε αὐτῷ τοὺς ὁσίους αὐτοῦ, τοὺς διατιθεμένους 5

**PSALM XLVIII. (KJV Ps 49)**

5 upon the harp my riddle.
Wherefore should I fear in an evil day,
when the iniquity of my heel shall encompass me?
7 They that trust in their power,
and boast themselves in the multitude of their wealth;
8 A brother doth not redeem; shall a man redeem?
He shall not give unto God his propitiation,
9 And the price of the redemption of his soul;
and it ceaseth for ever.
10 And he shall live yet unto the end;
[for] he shall not see corruption.
11 When he beholdeth wise men dying,
together the fool and the senseless shall perish,
And they shall leave their wealth unto strangers.
12 And their graves are their houses for ever;
their dwelling-places from generation to generation;
they called their names upon their lands.
13 And man, being in honor, hath not understood;
he was compared unto the senseless beasts,
and was made like unto them.
14 This their way is a stumbling-block unto them;
and after these things, they shall delight in their mouth. Selah.
15 Like sheep were they placed in Hades;
death shall shepherd them.
And the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning;
And their help shall grow old in Hades,
[separated] from their glory; (they were cast forth).
16 But God shall redeem my soul from the hand of Hades,
when He shall take me. Selah.
17 Fear thou not when a man shall grow rich,
or when the glory of his house shall be multiplied;
18 For when he dieth he shall not take all things;
neither shall his glory go down with him.
19 For his soul shall be blessed in his life;
he shall confess to Thee when Thou doest good unto him.
20 He shall enter unto the generation of his fathers;
unto eternity shall he not see light.
21 And man, being in honor, hath not understood;
he was compared unto the senseless beasts,
and was made like unto them.

**PSALM XLIX. (KJV Ps 50)**

Unto the End, A Psalm for Asaph.

1 The God of gods, even the Lord, hath spoken,
and hath called the earth
from the rising of the sun [and] unto its setting.
2 From Zion is the comeliness of His beauty.
3 Our God shall come manifestly,
and He shall not keep silence.
Fire before Him shall burn,
and round about Him a very great tempest.
4 He shall call the heaven above, and the earth,
to judge His people.
5 Gather unto Him His holy ones,
those who make His covenant by sacrifices.
