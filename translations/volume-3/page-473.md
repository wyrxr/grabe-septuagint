²⁵ ἁγιάσουσι. Καὶ ἐπὶ ψυχὴν ἀνθρώπου οὐκ εἰσελεύσονται τοῦ μιανθῆναι, ἀλλ’ ἢ ἐπὶ πατρί, καὶ ἐπὶ μητρί, καὶ ἐπὶ υἱῷ, καὶ ἐπὶ θυγατρί, καὶ ἐπὶ ἀδελφῷ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπὶ ἀδελφῇ αὐτοῦ, ἢ οὐ γέγονεν ἀνδρί, μιανθήσεται.
²⁶ Καὶ μετὰ τὸ καθαρισθῆναι αὐτὸν ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας, ἐξαριθμήσει αὐτῷ.
²⁷ Καὶ ᾗ ἂν ἡμέρᾳ εἰσπορεύωνται εἰς τὴν αὐλὴν τὴν ἐσωτέραν τοῦ λειτουργεῖν ἐν τῷ ἁγίῳ, προσάξουσιν ἱλασμόν, λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεός,
²⁸ καὶ ἔσται αὐτοῖς εἰς κληρονομίαν· ἐγὼ κληρονομία αὐτοῖς, καὶ κατάσχεσις αὐτοῖς οὐ δοθήσεται ἐν τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ, ὅτι ἐγὼ κατάσχεσις αὐτῶν.
²⁹ Καὶ τὰς θυσίας, καὶ τὰ ὑπὲρ ἁμαρτίας, καὶ τὰ ὑπὲρ ἀγνοίας, οὗτοι φάγονται· καὶ πᾶν ἀφόρισμα ἐν τῷ Ἰσραὴλ αὐτοῖς ἔσται·
³⁰ καὶ ἀπαρχαὶ πάντων, καὶ τὰ πρωτότοκα πάντων, καὶ τὰ ἀφαιρέματα πάντα ὑμῶν, ἐκ πάντων τῶν ἀπαρχῶν ὑμῶν, τοῖς ἱερεῦσιν ἔσται· καὶ τὰ πρωτογεννήματα ὑμῶν δώσετε τῷ ἱερεῖ, τοῦ θεῖναι εὐλογίας ὑμῶν ἐπὶ τοὺς οἴκους ὑμῶν.
³¹ Καὶ πᾶν θνησιμαῖον καὶ θηριάλωτον ἐκ τῶν πετεινῶν, καὶ ἐκ τῶν κτηνῶν, οὐ φάγονται οἱ ἱερεῖς.

¹ ΚΑΙ ἐν τῷ καταμετρεῖσθαι ὑμᾶς τὴν γῆν ἐν κληρονομίᾳ, ἀφοριεῖτε ἀπαρχὴν τῷ Κυρίῳ ἅγιον ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς πέντε καὶ εἴκοσι χιλιάδας μῆκος, καὶ εὖρος εἴκοσι χιλιάδας, ἅγιον ἔσται ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς ὁρίοις αὐτοῦ κυκλόθεν.
² Καὶ ἔσται ἐκ τούτου εἰς ἁγίασμα, πεντακόσιοι ἐπὶ πεντακοσίους τετράγωνον κυκλόθεν, καὶ πήχεις πεντήκοντα διάστημα αὐτῶν κυκλόθεν.
³ Καὶ ἐκ ταύτης τῆς διαμετρήσεως διαμετρήσεις μῆκος πέντε καὶ εἴκοσι χιλιάδας, καὶ εὖρος δέκα εἴκοσι χιλιάδας· καὶ ἐν αὐτῇ ἔσται τὸ ἁγίασμα τῶν ἁγίων.
⁴ Ἅγιον ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς ἔσται τοῖς ἱερεῦσι τοῖς λειτουργοῦσιν ἐν τῷ ἁγίῳ, καὶ ἔσται τοῖς ἐγγίζουσιν ἐν αὐτῷ λειτουργεῖν τῷ Κυρίῳ· καὶ ἔσται αὐτοῖς τόπος εἰς οἴκους ἀφωρισμένους τῷ ἁγιασμῷ αὐτῶν,
⁵ εἴκοσι καὶ πέντε χιλιάδες μῆκος, καὶ εἴκοσι δέκα χιλιάδες εὖρος ἔσται, καὶ τοῖς Λευΐταις τοῖς λειτουργοῦσι τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῖς εἰς κατάσχεσιν πόλεις τοῦ κατοικεῖν.
⁶ Καὶ τὴν κατάσχεσιν τῆς πόλεως δώσεις πέντε χιλιάδας εὖρος, καὶ μῆκος πέντε καὶ εἴκοσι χιλιάδας, ὃν τρόπον καὶ ἡ ἀπαρχὴ τῶν ἁγίων παντὶ οἴκῳ Ἰσραὴλ ἔσονται, καὶ τῷ ἡγουμένῳ ἐκ τούτου·
⁷ καὶ ἀπὸ τούτου εἰς τὰς ἀπαρχὰς τῶν ἁγίων

**Chapter 44**

²⁵ And upon the soul of a man shall they not enter in to be defiled, save for father, and for mother, and for son, and for daughter, and for his brother, and for his sister who hath not been with a man, shall he be defiled.
²⁶ And after he hath been cleansed seven days, he shall number unto him.
²⁷ And in whatsoever day they shall enter into the inner court to minister in the holy [place], they shall offer a propitiation, saith the Lord God.

²⁹ And the sacrifices, and the [offerings] for sin, and the [offerings] for ignorance, these shall they eat; and every devoted thing in Israel shall be theirs.
³⁰ And the firstfruits of all things, and the firstborn of all things, and all your heave-offerings, from all your firstfruits, shall be for the priests; and your first-generated fruits shall ye give unto the priest, to set your blessings upon your houses.

⁶ And the possession of the city ye shall give five thousands in breadth, and five and twenty thousands in length, in the manner that also the firstfruits of the holy [portions] shall be for all the house of Israel, and for the prince from this [portion].
