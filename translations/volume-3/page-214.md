22 ξει, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ὁ ἀποκλείσων, καὶ κλείσει, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ὁ ἀνοί-
23 γων. Καὶ στήσω αὐτὸν ἄρχοντα ἐν τόπῳ πιστῷ, καὶ ἔσται εἰς
24 θρόνον δόξης τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἔσται πεποιθὼς
    ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν πᾶς ἔνδοξος ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ, ἀπὸ μικροῦ
    ἕως μεγάλου· πᾶν τὸ σκεῦος τὸ μικρὸν ἀπὸ σκεύους τῶν Ἀγανῶν,
    καὶ ἔσονται ἐπικρεμάμενοι ἐν αὐτῷ. Ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ·
25 τάδε λέγει Κύριος Σαβαώθ, κινηθήσεται ὁ ἄνθρωπος ὁ ἐστηριγ-
    μένος ἐν τόπῳ πιστῷ, καὶ ἀφαιρεθήσεται, καὶ πεσεῖται, καὶ ἐ-
    ξολοθρευθήσεται ἡ δόξα ἡ ἐπ᾿ αὐτόν, ὅτι Κύριος ἐλάλησεν.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΓʹ. ΧΧΙΙΙ.

1 ΤΟ ΟΡΑΜΑ ΤΥΡΟΥ. Ὀλολύζετε πλοῖα Καρχηδόνος, ὅτι
    ἀπώλετο, καὶ οὐκέτι ἔρχονται ἐκ γῆς Κητιαίων, ἥκται αἰχμά-
2 λωτος. Τίνι ὅμοιοι γεγόνασιν οἱ ἐνοικοῦντες ἐν τῇ νήσῳ, μετάβολοι
3 Φοίνικης, διαπερῶντες τὴν θάλασσαν ἐν ὕδατι πολλῷ, σπέρμα
    μεταβόλων, ὡς ἀμητοῦ εἰσφερομένου, οἱ μετάβολοι τῶν ἐθνῶν.
4 Αἰσχύνθητι, Σιδών, εἶπεν ἡ θάλασσα· ἡ δὲ ἰσχὺς τῆς θαλάσσης
    εἶπεν, "οὐκ ὠδῖνον, οὐδὲ ἔτεκον, οὐδὲ ἐξέθρεψα νεανίσκους, οὐδὲ
5 ὕψωσα παρθένους." Ὅταν δὲ ἀκουστὸν γένηται ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ, λή-
6 ψεται αὐτοὺς ὀδύνη περὶ Τύρου. Ἀπέλθετε εἰς Καρχηδόνα, ὀ-
7 λολύζετε οἱ ἐνοικοῦντες ἐν τῇ νήσῳ ταύτῃ. Οὐχ αὕτη ἡμῶν ἦν
    ἡ ὕβρις ἡ ἀπ᾿ ἀρχῆς, πρὶν παραδοθῆναι αὐτήν; ἀπάξουσιν αὐτὴν
8 οἱ πόδες αὐτῆς πόῤῥωθεν εἰς παροικίαν. Τίς ταῦτα ἐβούλευσεν
    ἐπὶ Τύρον; μὴ ἧσσον ἐστὶν, ἢ οὐκ ἰσχύει; οἱ ἔμποροι αὐτῆς
9 ἔνδοξοι Χαναὰν, ἄρχοντες τῆς γῆς. Κύριος Σαβαὼθ ἐβουλεύσατο
10 παραλῦσαι πᾶσαν τὴν ὕβριν τῶν ἐνδόξων, καὶ ἀτιμάσαι πᾶν ἔν-
    δοξον ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς. Ἐργάζου τὴν γῆν σου, καὶ γὰρ πλοῖα οὐκέτι
11 ἔρχονται ἐκ Καρχηδόνος. Ἡ δὲ χείρ σου οὐκέτι ἰσχύει κατὰ
    θάλασσαν, ἣ παροξύνουσα βασιλεῖς. Κύριος Σαβαὼθ ἐνετείλατο
12 περὶ Χαναὰν ἀπολέσαι αὐτῆς τὴν ἰσχύν. Καὶ ἐροῦσιν· οὐκέτι μὴ
    προσθῆτε τοῦ ὑβρίζειν καὶ ἀδικεῖν παρθένον τὴν θυγατέρα Σι-
    δῶνος· καὶ ἐὰν ἀπέλθῃς εἰς Κητιεὶμ, οὐδὲ ἐκεῖ σοι ἀνάπαυσις ἔσται.
13 Καὶ εἰς γῆν Χαλδαίων, καὶ αὕτη ἠρήμωται ἀπὸ τῶν Ἀσσυρίων,
    (οὐδὲ ἐκεῖ σοι ἀνάπαυσις ἔσται) ἐθεμελίωσεν αὐτὴν εἷς Σηεὶμ, ἔ-
    στησαν ἐπάλξεις αὐτοῦ, ἐξήγειραν βάσεις αὐτῆς, ἔτι δ᾽ ὁ τοῖχος

**Chapter 22**
**22** [he] shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open.
**23** And I will fasten him as a ruler in a sure place; and he shall be for
**24** a throne of glory to the house of his father. And every glorious [one] in the house of his father shall rely upon him, from the least even unto the greatest; every small vessel, from the vessels of the Agannoi, and they shall be hung upon him.
**25** In that day, thus saith the Lord Sabaoth, the man that is established in a sure place shall be moved, and shall be taken away, and shall fall, and the glory that is upon him shall be utterly destroyed; because the Lord hath spoken [it].

**Chapter 23**
**1** THE ORACLE OF TYRE.
Wail, ye ships of Carthage, for it is perished, and they come no more from the land of the Kittim; it hath been brought captive.
**2** To whom are the inhabitants of the island become like? [They are] merchants of Phoenicia,
**3** crossing the sea in much water, a seed of merchants; as the harvest brought in, are the merchants of the nations.
**4** Be thou ashamed, O Sidon, saith the sea; yea, the strength of the sea hath spoken, [saying], "I have not travailed, nor brought forth, nor reared up young men, nor
**5** reared up virgins." When it shall be heard in Egypt, pain shall seize them concerning Tyre.
**6** Go ye over to Carthage; wail,
**7** ye inhabitants of this island. Was not this our insolence from the beginning, before it was delivered up? Her feet shall carry her far off into sojourning.
**8** Who hath counselled these things against Tyre? Is she not less [in strength], or hath she no might? Her merchants [are]
**9** glorious Canaanites, the princes of the earth. The Lord Sabaoth hath counselled
**10** to paralyse all the insolence of the glorious ones, and to dishonour every glorious [one] upon the earth. Till thy land, for the ships come no more
**11** from Carthage. And thy hand no longer hath power over the sea, which provoketh kings. The Lord Sabaoth hath commanded
**12** concerning Canaan to destroy her strength. And they shall say, "Ye shall no more continue to insult and wrong the virgin, the daughter of Sidon; and if thou goest unto Kittim, neither there shall there be rest for thee."
**13** Yea, and into the land of the Chaldeans; and this [land] is laid waste by the Assyrians (neither there shall there be rest for thee). One Sheim founded her, they set up her battlements, they raised up her foundations; yet her wall
