ΚΕΦ. ΚΗ΄. ΙΕΡΕΜΙΑΣ 1260
12 ταύτῃ. Ἠσχύνθη ἡ μήτηρ ὑμῶν σφόδρα, ἐνετράπη ἡ τεκοῦσα
    ὑμᾶς μήτηρ ἐπ᾿ ἀγαθά, ἐσχάτη ἐθνῶν, ἔρημος καὶ ἄνυδρος καὶ
13 ἄβατος, ἀπὸ ὀργῆς Κυρίου οὐ κατοικηθήσεται εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα·
    καὶ ἔσται εἰς ἀφανισμὸν πᾶσα ἡ γῆ, καὶ πᾶς ὁ διοδεύων διὰ
    Βαβυλῶνος σκυθρωπάσει, καὶ συριοῦσιν ἐπὶ πᾶσαν τὴν πληγὴν
14 αὐτῆς. Παρατάξασθε ἐπὶ Βαβυλῶνα κύκλῳ πάντες τείνοντες
    τόξον, τοξεύσατε ἐπ᾿ αὐτήν, μὴ φείσησθε ἐπὶ τοῖς τοξεύμασιν
15 ὑμῶν, ὅτι τῷ Κυρίῳ ἥμαρτε. Καὶ κατακροτήσατε ἐπ᾿ αὐτὴν
    κύκλῳ· παρελύθησαν αἱ χεῖρες αὐτῆς, ἔπεσαν αἱ ἐπάλξεις αὐτῆς,
16 κατεσκάφη τὸ τεῖχος αὐτῆς· ὅτι ἐκδίκησις παρὰ Θεοῦ
    ἐστιν, ἐκδικεῖτε ἐπ᾿ αὐτήν, καθὼς ἐποίησε, ποιήσατε αὐτῇ.
    Ἐξολευθεύσατε σπέρμα ἐκ Βαβυλῶνος, κατέχοντα δρέπανον ἐν
    καιρῷ θερισμοῦ ἀπὸ προσώπου μαχαίρας Ἑλληνικῆς, ἕκαστος
    εἰς τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ ἀποστρέψουσι, καὶ ἕκαστος εἰς τὴν γῆν
17 αὐτοῦ φεύξεται. Πρόβατον πλανώμενον Ἰσραήλ, λέοντες ἔξωσαν
    αὐτόν· ὁ πρῶτος ἔφαγεν αὐτὸν βασιλεὺς Ἀσσοῦρ, καὶ οὗτος
    ὕστερον τὰ ὀστᾶ αὐτοῦ Ναβουχοδονόσορ βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος.
18 Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Κύριος τῶν δυνάμεων ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ·
    ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐκδικῶ ἐπὶ τὸν βασιλέα Βαβυλῶνος, καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν
19 αὐτοῦ, καθὼς ἐξεδίκησαν ἐπὶ τὸν βασιλέα Ἀσσοῦρ. Καὶ ἀπο-
    καταστήσω τὸν Ἰσραὴλ εἰς τὴν νομὴν αὐτοῦ, καὶ νεμήσεται ἐν
    τῷ Καρμήλῳ, καὶ ἐν τῇ Βασὰν, καὶ ἐν ὄρει Ἐφραΐμ, καὶ ἐν τῷ
20 Γαλαάδ, καὶ ἐκπλησθήσεται ἡ ψυχὴ αὐτοῦ. Ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις
    ἐκείναις, καὶ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ, φησὶ Κύριος, ζητήσουσι τὴν
    ἀδικίαν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ οὐχ ὑπάρξει, καὶ τὰς ἁμαρτίας Ἰούδα, καὶ
21 οὐ μὴ εὑρεθῶσιν, ὅτι ἵλεως ἔσομαι τοῖς ὑπολελειμμένοις ἐπὶ τῆς
    γῆς, λέγει Κύριος· πικρῶς ἐπίθι ἐπ᾿ αὐτήν, καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς
    κατοικοῦντας αὐτήν· ἐκδίκησον, μάχαιρα, καὶ ἀφάνισον κατό-
    πισθεν αὐτῶν, λέγει Κύριος, καὶ ποίει κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἐντέλ-
22 λομαί σοι. Φωνὴ πολέμου καὶ συντριβὴ μεγάλη ἐν γῇ Χαλδαίων.
23 Πῶς συνεβλάσθη καὶ συνετρίβη ἡ σφυρὰ πάσης τῆς γῆς;
24 πῶς ἐγενήθη εἰς ἀφανισμὸν Βαβυλὼν ἐν ἔθνεσιν; Ἐπιθήσονταί
    σοι, καὶ ἁλώσῃ, καὶ οὐ γνώσῃ, ὡς Βαβυλών· καὶ εὑρέθης, καὶ
25 ἐλήφθης, ὅτι τῷ Κυρίῳ ἀντέστης. Ἤνοιξε Κύριος τὸν θησαυ-
26 ρὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐξήνεγκε τὰ σκεύη ὀργῆς αὐτοῦ, ὅτι ἔργον τῷ
    Κυρίῳ Θεῷ τῶν δυνάμεων ἐν γῇ Χαλδαίων, ὅτι ἐληλύθασιν

**Jeremiah 27**
(Hebrew Chapter 50)

**12** To this one. Your mother shall be greatly shamed; your mother who bare you for [her former] prosperity shall be confounded. She is the last of the nations, a wilderness and waterless and impassable.
**13** From the wrath of the Lord shall she not be inhabited forever; and all the land shall be for utter desolation. And every one that passeth through Babylon shall be sorrowful, and they shall hiss upon all her plague.
**14** Array yourselves against Babylon round about, all ye that bend the bow; shoot ye at her, spare not your arrows, for she hath sinned against the Lord.
**15** And shout ye against her round about; her hands are paralyzed, her battlements are fallen,
**16** her wall is razed. For it is the vengeance from God; avenge ye upon her. As she hath done, so do ye unto her. Root out the seed from Babylon, [even] him that holdeth a sickle in the time of harvest, from the face of a Greek sword. Every one shall return to his own people, and every one shall flee to his own land.
**17** Israel is a wandering sheep; lions have cast him out. The first did eat him, the king of Assyria; and this one afterward [did break] his bones, Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon.
**18** Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: “Behold, I will avenge upon the king of Babylon, and upon his land, as they avenged upon the king of Assyria.
**19** And I will restore Israel to his pasture, and he shall feed in Carmel, and in Bashan, and in Mount Ephraim, and in Gilead; and his soul shall be satisfied.”
**20** In those days, and in that time, saith the Lord, they shall seek the iniquity of Israel, and it shall not exist; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found. For I will be propitious unto those who remain upon the land, saith the Lord.
**21** Bitterly fall upon her, and upon those who dwell therein. Avenge, O sword, and destroy after them, saith the Lord, and do according to all things which I command thee.
**22** A sound of war and great destruction [is] in the land of the Chaldeans.
**23** How is the hammer of the whole earth crushed and shattered? How is Babylon become a desolation among the nations?
**24** They shall be laid upon thee, and thou shalt be taken, and thou shalt not know, forasmuch as thou art Babylon. And thou art found, and thou art caught, because thou hast resisted the Lord.
**25** The Lord hath opened His treasury, and hath brought forth the vessels of His wrath;
**26** for it is a work for the Lord God of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans, because her times are come.
