ΚΕΦ. ΑΓʹ. ΙΕΡΕΜΙΑΣ 1297
Καὶ ἀνέγνω Ἰουδεὶν εἰς τὰ ὦτα τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ εἰς τὰ ὦτα
πάντων τῶν ἀρχόντων, τῶν ἑστηκότων πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα. Καὶ 22
ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐκάθητο ἐν οἴκῳ χειμερινῷ ἐν τῷ μηνὶ τῷ ἐννάτῳ,
καὶ ἐσχάρα πυρὸς κατὰ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐγενήθη ἀναγι- 23
νώσκοντος Ἰουδεὶν τρεῖς σελίδας καὶ τέσσαρας, ἀπέτεμεν αὐτὰ
τῷ ξυρῷ τοῦ γραμματέως, καὶ ἔριπτεν εἰς τὸ πῦρ τὸ ἐπὶ τῆς
ἐσχάρας. ἕως οὗ ἐξέλιπε πᾶς ὁ χάρτης εἰς τὸ πῦρ τὸ ἐπὶ τῆς
ἐσχάρας. Καὶ οὐκ ἐξεζήτησαν, καὶ οὐ διέρρηξαν τὰ ἱμάτια αὐ- 24
τῶν ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ πάντες οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ οἱ ἀκούσαντες πάν-
τας τοὺς λόγους τούτους. Καὶ Ναθαν καὶ Γοδολίας καὶ Γα- 25
μαρίας ὑπέθεντο τῷ βασιλεῖ, πρὸς τὸ μὴ κατακαῦσαι τὸ χαρτίον,
καὶ οὐκ ἤκουσεν αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐνετείλατο ὁ βασιλεὺς τῷ Ἱερε- 26
μιὴλ υἱῷ τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ τῷ Σαραίᾳ υἱῷ Ἐζριήλ, καὶ τῷ
Σελεμίᾳ υἱῷ τοῦ Ἀβδιήλ, συλλαβεῖν τὸν Βαροὺχ τὸν γραμμα-
τέα, καὶ τὸν Ἱερεμίαν τὸν προφήτην· καὶ κατεκρύβησαν ὑπὸ
Κυρίου. Καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς Ἱερεμίαν, μετὰ τὸ 27
καῦσαι τὸν βασιλέα τὸ χαρτίον πάντας τοὺς λόγους, οὓς ἔγρα-
ψε Βαροὺχ ἀπὸ στόματος Ἱερεμίου, λέγων. Πάλιν λάβε σεαυ- 28
τῷ χαρτίον ἕτερον, καὶ γράψον ἅπαντας τοὺς λόγους, τοὺς ὄν-
τας ἐπὶ τοῦ χαρτίου, οὓς κατέκαυσεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἰούδα Ἰωα-
κείμ. Καὶ πρὸς Ἰωακεὶμ βασιλέα Ἰούδα ἐρεῖς, οὕτως εἶπε 29
Κύριος· σὺ κατέκαυσας τὸ χαρτίον τοῦτο, λέγων, διατί ἔγραψας
ἐπ’ αὐτῷ, λέγων, εἰσπορευόμενος εἰσπορεύσεται ὁ βασιλεὺς Βα-
βυλῶνος, καὶ ἐξολοθρεύσει τὴν γῆν ταύτην, καὶ ἐκλείψει ἀπ’ αὐ-
τῆς ἄνθρωπος καὶ κτήνη; Διὰ τοῦτο οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος ἐπὶ 30
Ἰωακεὶμ βασιλέα Ἰούδα· οὐκ ἔσται αὐτῷ καθήμενος ἐπὶ θρό-
νου Δαυίδ, καὶ τὸ θνησιμαῖον αὐτοῦ ἔσται ἐῤῥιμμένον ἐν τῷ καύ-
ματι τῆς ἡμέρας, καὶ ἐν τῷ παγετῷ τῆς νυκτός, καὶ ἐπισκέψομαι 31
ἐπ’ αὐτὸν καὶ ἐπὶ τὸ γένος αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς παῖδας αὐτοῦ,
τὰς ἀνομίας αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπάξω ἐπ’ αὐτούς, καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἐπὶ γῆν Ἰούδα πάντα τὰ κακά,
ἃ ἐλάλησα πρὸς αὐτούς, καὶ οὐκ ἤκουσαν. Καὶ ἔλαβεν Ἱερεμίας 32
χαρτίον ἕτερον, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὸ Βαροὺχ υἱῷ Νηρίου τῷ γραμ-
ματεῖ, καὶ ἔγραφεν ἐπ’ αὐτῷ ἀπὸ στόματος Ἱερεμίου ἅπαντας
τοὺς λόγους τοῦ βιβλίου, οὓς κατέκαυσεν Ἰωακεὶμ βασιλεὺς Ἰούδα.
καὶ ἔτι προσετέθησαν αὐτῷ λόγοι πλείονες, ὡς οὗτοι.

**JEREMIAH 43 (Septuagint) / JEREMIAH 36 (Hebrew)**

**21** And Jehudi did read in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes that stood beside the king.
**22** Now the king sat in a winter house in the ninth month, and a brazier of fire was before him.
**23** And it came to pass, as Jehudi read three or four columns, that he cut them with the scribe's razor, and cast them into the fire that was upon the brazier; until all the scroll was consumed in the fire that was upon the brazier.
**24** Yet neither the king, nor all his servants that heard all these words, were afraid, nor did they rend their garments.
**25** Nevertheless, Nathan, and Gedaliah, and Gamariah did intercede with the king, that he might not burn the scroll; but he hearkened not unto them.
**26** Then the king commanded Jerahmeel the king's son, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to seize Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet; but they were hidden by the Lord.

**27** Now the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the scroll, even all the words which Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah, saying:
**28** "Take thee again another scroll, and write therein all the words that were in the former scroll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah did burn.
**29** And unto Jehoiakim king of Judah shalt thou say, 'Thus saith the Lord: Thou hast burned this scroll, saying, "Why hast thou written therein, saying, 'The king of Babylon shall surely come, and utterly destroy this land, and shall cause man and beast to cease from it'?"'
**30** Therefore, thus saith the Lord concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: There shall not be unto him [one] sitting upon the throne of David; and his dead body shall be cast out to the heat of the day, and to the frost of the night.
**31** And I will visit upon him, and upon his lineage, and upon his servants their iniquities; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the land of Judah, all the evils which I have spoken unto them, because they hearkened not."
**32** Then Jeremiah took another scroll, and gave it to Baruch the son of Neriah the scribe; and he wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned. And there were yet added unto them many more words, like unto these.
