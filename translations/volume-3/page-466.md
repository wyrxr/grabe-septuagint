10 πέντε, καὶ τὰ ἀπόλοιπα ἀναμέσον τῶν πλευρῶν τοῦ οἴκου, καὶ
ἀναμέσον τῶν ἐξέδρων, καὶ εὖρος πήχεων εἴκοσι, τὸ περιφερὲς
11 τοῦ οἴκου κύκλῳ. Καὶ αἱ θυρίδες τῶν ἐξέδρων ἐπὶ τὸ ἀπόλοιπον
τῆς θύρας τῆς μιᾶς τῆς πρὸς βορρᾶν· καὶ ἡ θύρα ἡ μία πρὸς
νότον, καὶ τὸ εὖρος τοῦ φωτὸς τοῦ ἀπολοίπου πηχῶν πέντε
12 πλάτος κυκλόθεν. Καὶ τὸ διορίζον κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ ἀπολοίπου,
ὡς πρὸς θάλασσαν πήχεων ἑβδομήκοντα, πλάτος τοῦ τοίχου
τοῦ διορίζοντος πήχεων πέντε, εὖρος κυκλόθεν, καὶ μῆκος αὐτοῦ
13 πήχεων ἐνενήκοντα. Καὶ διεμέτρησε κατέναντι τοῦ οἴκου μῆκος
πήχεων ἑκατόν, καὶ τὰ ἀπόλοιπα καὶ τὰ διορίζοντα, καὶ οἱ τοῖχοι
14 αὐτῶν μῆκος πηχῶν ἑκατόν. Καὶ τὸ εὖρος κατὰ πρόσωπον
15 τοῦ οἴκου, καὶ τὰ ἀπόλοιπα κατέναντι πηχῶν ἑκατόν. Καὶ διεμέτρησε
μῆκος τοῦ διορίζοντος κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ ἀπολοίπου
τῶν κατόπισθεν τοῦ οἴκου ἐκείνου, καὶ τὰ ἀπόλοιπα ἔνθεν καὶ
ἔνθεν πηχῶν ἑκατὸν τὸ μῆκος· καὶ ὁ ναὸς καὶ αἱ γωνίαι καὶ
16 τὸ Αἰλὰμ τὸ ἐξώτερον, πεφατνωμένα. Καὶ αἱ θυρίδες δικτυωταί,
ὑποφαύσεις κύκλῳ τοῖς τρισίν, ὥστε διακόπτειν· καὶ ὁ οἶκος
καὶ τὰ πλησίον ἐξυλωμένα κύκλῳ, καὶ τὸ ἔδαφος καὶ ἐκ
τοῦ ἐδάφους ἕως τῶν θυρίδων· καὶ αἱ θυρίδες ἀναπτυσσόμεναι
17 τρισσῶς εἰς τὸ διακόπτειν, καὶ ἕως πλησίον τῆς ἐσωτέρας καὶ
ἕως τῆς ἐξωτέρας· καὶ ἐφ᾿ ὅλον τὸν τοῖχον κυκλόθεν ἐν τῷ ἔσωθεν
18 καὶ ἐν τῷ ἔξωθεν μέτρα, καὶ γεγλυμμένα Χερουβείμ· καὶ φοίνικες·
καὶ φοῖνιξ ἀναμέσον Χεροὺβ καὶ Χεροῦβ· δύο πρόσωπα
19 τῷ Χερούβ, πρόσωπον ἀνθρώπου πρὸς τὸν φοίνικα ἔνθεν
καὶ ἔνθεν· καὶ πρόσωπον λέοντος πρὸς τὸν φοίνικα ἔνθεν καὶ
20 ἔνθεν, διαγεγλυμμένος ὅλος ὁ οἶκος κυκλόθεν. Ἐκ τοῦ ἐδάφους
ἕως τοῦ φατνώματος τῆς θύρας τὰ Χερουβείμ καὶ οἱ φοίνικες
21 διαγεγλυμμένοι. Καὶ τὸ ἅγιον καὶ ὁ ναὸς ἀναπτυσσόμενα
τετράγωνα, κατὰ πρόσωπον τῶν ἁγίων ὄρασις ὡς ὄψις θυσιαστη-
22 ρίου ξυλίνου, πήχεων τριῶν τὸ ὕψος αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὸ μῆκος πήχεων
δύο, καὶ τὸ εὖρος πήχεων δύο· καὶ κέρατα εἶχε, καὶ ἡ βάσις αὐτοῦ
καὶ οἱ τοῖχοι αὐτοῦ ξύλινοι· καὶ εἶπε πρὸς μέ· αὕτη ἡ τράπεζα,
23 ἡ πρὸ προσώπου Κυρίου· καὶ δύο θυρώματα τῷ ναῷ, καὶ
24 τῷ ἁγίῳ † δύο θυρώματα, τοῖς δυσὶ θυρώμασι τοῖς στροφωτοῖς·
δύο θυρώματα τῷ ἑνί, καὶ δύο θυρώματα τῇ δευτέρᾳ θύρᾳ·
25 καὶ γλυφὴ ἐπ᾿ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ θυρώματα τοῦ ναοῦ Χερουβείμ·

**Ezekiel 41**
10 Five [cubits]; and the remaining space betwixt the side-chambers of the house, and betwixt the [outer] chambers, and [its] breadth [was] twenty cubits, [which formed] the circuit of the house round about.
11 And the doors of the chambers [were set] toward the remaining space of the one door that looked toward the north; and the one door looked toward the south; and the breadth of the opening of the remaining space [was] five cubits, all round about.
12 And the separating structure before the remaining space, as toward the west, [was] seventy cubits; the breadth of the wall of the separating structure [was] five cubits, round about, and its length ninety cubits.
13 And he measured over against the house, a length of a hundred cubits, both the remaining spaces and the separating structures; and their walls [were] a hundred cubits in length.
14 And the breadth before the house, and the remaining spaces opposite, [was] a hundred cubits.
15 And he measured the length of the separating structure before the remaining space behind that house; and the remaining spaces on this side and on that side [were] a hundred cubits in length; and the temple, and the corners, and the outer Ailam, were paneled.
16 And the windows [were] latticed, [having] openings for light all round to the three [stories], so as to admit the light; and the house and the parts near by were covered with wood round about, both the floor, and from the floor even unto the windows; and the windows were folding in three ways, so as to admit the light,
17 and even nigh unto the inner [part], and even unto the outer [part]. And upon all the wall round about, within and without, [there were] measurements, and carved Cherubim;
18 and palm trees; and a palm tree was betwixt a Cherub and a Cherub; two faces had each Cherub:
19 the face of a man toward the palm tree on this side and on that side; and the face of a lion toward the palm tree on this side and on that side. The whole house was carved all round about.
20 From the floor even unto the paneling of the door, the Cherubim and the palm trees were carved.
21 And the Holy Place and the temple were laid out in squares. Before the holy places [there was] an appearance like the sight of a wooden altar,
22 whose height [was] three cubits, and its length two cubits, and its breadth two cubits; and it had horns, and its base and its walls [were] of wood. And he said unto me, "This [is] the table that [is] before the face of the Lord."
23 And two doorways [were] for the temple; and
24 for the Holy Place † two doorways, the two doorways being folding doors; two leaves [were] for the one [door], and two leaves for the second door.
25 And there was carving upon them, and upon the doorways of the temple [were] Cherubim;
