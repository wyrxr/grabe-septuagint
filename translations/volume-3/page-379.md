ΚΕΦ. Αʹ.                ΘΡΗΝΟΙ          1317
νοντο οἱ ἄρχοντες αὐτῆς ὡς κριοὶ μὴ εὑρίσκοντες νομήν, καὶ
ἐπορεύοντο ἐν οὐκ ἰσχύϊ ἐνώπιον διώκοντος.
                    Ζαΐν.
Ἐμνήσθη Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἡμερῶν ταπεινώσεως αὐτῆς, καὶ ἀπωσμῶν 7
αὐτῆς· πάντα τὰ ἐπιθυμήματα αὐτῆς ὅσα ἦν ἐξ ἡμερῶν ἀρχαίων
ἐν τῷ πεσεῖν τὸν λαὸν αὐτῆς εἰς χεῖρας θλίβοντος, καὶ
οὐκ ἦν ὁ βοηθῶν αὐτῇ· ἰδόντες οἱ ἐχθροὶ αὐτῆς ἐγέλασαν ἐπὶ
μετοικεσίας αὐτῆς.
                    Ἤθ.
Ἀμαρτίαν ἥμαρτεν Ἱερουσαλήμ, διὰ τοῦτο εἰς σάλον ἐγένετο· 8
πάντες οἱ δοξάζοντες αὐτήν, ἐταπείνωσαν αὐτήν· εἶδον γὰρ
τὴν ἀσχημοσύνην αὐτῆς, καί γε αὐτὴ στενάζουσα, καὶ ἀπεστράφη
εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω.
                    Τήθ.
Ἀκαθαρσία αὐτῆς πρὸς ποδῶν αὐτῆς, οὐκ ἐμνήσθη ἐσχάτων 9
αὐτῆς, καὶ κατεβίβασεν ὑπέρογκα· οὐκ ἔστιν ὁ παρακαλῶν αὐτήν·
ἴδε, Κύριε, τὴν ταπείνωσίν μου, ὅτι ἐμεγαλύνθη ὁ ἐχθρός.
                    Ἰώδ.
Χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἐξέπετασε θλίβων ἐπὶ πάντα τὰ ἐπιθυμήματα 10
αὐτῆς, ἴδε γὰρ ἔθνη εἰσελθόντα εἰς τὸ ἁγίασμα αὐτῆς, ἃ ἐνετείλω
μὴ εἰσελθεῖν εἰς ἐκκλησίαν σου.
                    Κάφ.
Πᾶς ὁ λαὸς αὐτῆς καταστενάζοντες, ζητοῦντες ἄρτον· ἔδωκαν 11
τὰ ἐπιθυμήματα αὐτῆς ἐν βρώσει, τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι ψυχήν· ἴδε,
Κύριε, καὶ ἐπίβλεψον, ὅτι ἐγενήθην ἠτιμωμένη.
                    Λάμεδ.
Οἱ πρὸς ὑμᾶς πάντες παραπορευόμενοι ὁδόν, ἐπιστρέψατε καὶ 12
ἴδετε, εἰ ἔστιν ἄλγος κατὰ τὸ ἄλγος μου, ὃ ἐγενήθη· φθεγξάμενος
ἐν ἐμοὶ ἐταπείνωσέ με Κύριος ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ὀργῆς θυμοῦ αὐτοῦ.
                    Μήμ.
Ἐξ ὕψους αὐτοῦ ἀπέστειλε πῦρ, ἐν τοῖς ὀστέοις μου κατήγαγεν 13
αὐτό· διεπέτασε δίκτυον τοῖς ποσί μου, ἀπέστρεψέ με εἰς τὰ
ὀπίσω, ἔδωκέ με Κύριος ἠφανισμένην, ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν ὀδυνωμένην.
                    Νοῦν.
Ἐγρηγορήθη ἐπὶ τὰ ἀσεβήματά μου, ἐν χερσί μου συνεπλάκησαν· 14

her princes became as rams that find no pasture, and they went without strength before the pursuer.

**Zain.**
**7** Jerusalem remembered the days of her affliction and her rejections; all her desirable things, as many as were from ancient days, when her people fell into the hands of the oppressor, and there was none to help her. Her enemies, seeing [this], laughed at her captivity.

**Heth.**
**8** Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore is she become a trembling. All they that glorified her have humbled her; for they have seen her shame. Yea, she herself groaneth, and is turned backward.

**Teth.**
**9** Her defilement is at her feet; she remembered not her latter end. And she sank low exceedingly; there is none to comfort her. Behold, O Lord, my affliction; for the enemy is magnified.

**Yod.**
**10** The oppressor hath stretched out his hand upon all her desirable things; for she hath seen the nations enter into her sanctuary, whom Thou didst command that they should not enter into Thy congregation.

**Kaph.**
**11** All her people groan, seeking bread; they have given her desirable things for food, to revive the soul. Behold, O Lord, and consider; for I am become despised.

**Lamed.**
**12** All ye that pass by on the way, turn ye back and see, if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is come upon me. When He spake, the Lord afflicted me in the day of the wrath of His anger.

**Mem.**
**13** From on high hath He sent fire; into my bones hath He brought it down. He hath spread a net for my feet; He hath turned me back. The Lord hath made me desolate, all the day long [am I] in pain.

**Nun.**
**14** My transgressions were awakened [against me]; they are entangled in my hands.
