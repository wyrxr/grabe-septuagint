24 πάντες. Ἕξουσιν ἐπὶ σὲ ἀπὸ βορρᾶ, ἅρματα καὶ τροχοὶ ἵπποι μετὰ
ὄχλου λαῶν, θυρεοὶ καὶ πέλται καὶ περικεφαλαῖαι, καὶ βαλεῖ ἐπὶ σὲ
25 προφυλακὴν κύκλῳ. Καὶ δώσω πρὸ προσώπου αὐτῶν κρίμα, καὶ
ἐκδικήσουσί σε ἐν τοῖς κρίμασιν αὐτῶν· καὶ δώσω τὸν ζῆλόν μου ἐν
σοί, καὶ ποιήσουσι μετά σοῦ ἐν ὀργῇ θυμοῦ μου, μυκτῆρά σου καὶ
ὦτά σου ἀφελοῦσι, καὶ τοὺς καταλοίπους σου ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ κατα-
βαλοῦσιν· αὐτοὶ τοὺς υἱούς σου καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας σου λήψονται,
26 καὶ τοὺς καταλοίπους σου ἐμπρήσουσιν ἐν πυρί· καὶ ἐκδύσουσί σε
27 τὸν ἱματισμόν σου, καὶ λήψονται τὰ σκεύη τῆς καυχήσεώς σου. Καὶ
ἀποστρέψω τὰς ἀσεβείας σου ἐκ σοῦ, καὶ τὴν πορνείαν σου ἐκ γῆς
Αἰγύπτου· καὶ οὐ μὴ ἄρῃς τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς σου ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς, καὶ
28 Αἰγύπτου οὐ μὴ μνησθῇς οὐκέτι. Διότι τάδε λέγει Κύριος Κύριος
ὁ Θεός· Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ παραδίδωμί σε εἰς χεῖρας ὧν μισεῖς, ἀφ᾽ ὧν ἀ-
29 πέστη ἡ ψυχή σου ἀπ᾽ αὐτῶν. Καὶ ποιήσουσιν ἐν σοὶ ἐν μίσει, καὶ
λήψονται πάντας τοὺς πόνους σου καὶ τοὺς μόχθους σου, καὶ ἔσῃ
γυμνὴ καὶ ἀσχημονουσα, καὶ ἀποκαλυφθήσεται ἡ αἰσχύνη (σου)
πορνείας σου καὶ ἀσεβεία σου·
30 καὶ ἡ πορνεία σου ἐποίησε ταῦτά σοι, ἐν τῷ ἐκπορνεῦσαί σε ὀπίσω ἐθνῶν· καὶ ἐμίανον ἐν τοῖς ἐπι-
31 θυμήμασιν αὐτῶν. Ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ τῆς ἀδελφῆς σου ἐπορεύθης, καὶ
32 δώσω τὸ ποτήριον αὐτῆς εἰς τὰς χεῖράς σου. Τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναὶ
Κύριος Κύριος ὁ Θεός· τὸ ποτήριον τῆς ἀδελφῆς σου πίεσαι, τὸ
βαθὺ καὶ τὸ πλατὺ, ἔσται εἰς γέλωτα καὶ εἰς μυκτηρισμόν, τὸ
33 πλεονάζον τοῦ συντελέσαι μέθην, καὶ ἐκλύσεως πλησθήσῃ· καὶ τὸ
ποτήριον τῆς ἀδελφῆς σου Σαμαρείας ποτήριον ἀφανίας καὶ ἀφα-
34 νισμοῦ. Πίεσαι αὐτὸ, καὶ ἐκστραγγιεῖς, καὶ τὰς ἑορτὰς καὶ τὰς
νουμηνίας αὐτῆς ἀποστρέψω· διότι ἐγὼ ἐλάλησα, λέγει Κύριος
35 Κύριος ὁ Θεός. Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναὶ Κύριος· ἀνθ᾽ ὧν
ἐπελάθου μου, καὶ ἀπέρριψάς με ὀπίσω τοῦ σώματός σου, καὶ σὺ
36 λάβε τὴν ἀσέβειάν σου καὶ τὴν πορνείαν σου. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος
πρὸς μέ· υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, οὐ κρινεῖς τὴν Ὀολὰν καὶ τὴν Ὀολιβὰν,
37 καὶ ἀπαγγελεῖς αὐταῖς τὰς ἀνομίας αὐτῶν, ὅτι ἐμοιχεύοντο, καὶ
αἷμα ἐν χερσὶν αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰ ἐνθυμήματα αὐτῶν ἐμοιχεύοντο, καὶ
38 τὰ τέκνα αὐτῶν, ἃ ἐγέννησάν μοι, διῆγον αὐτοῖς δι᾽ ἐμπύρων. Ἕως
καὶ ταῦτα ἐποίησάν μοι, καὶ ἃ ἐμίσουν, ἐποίησαν· τὰ ἅγιά μου
39 ἐμίανον, καὶ τὰ σάββατά μου ἐβεβήλουν, καὶ ἐν τῷ σφάζειν αὐ-
τοὺς τὰ τέκνα αὐτῶν τοῖς εἰδώλοις αὐτῶν, καὶ εἰσεπορεύοντο εἰς

**24** All [of them]. They shall come against thee from the north, with chariots and horses bearing wheels, and with a multitude of peoples; with great shields and small shields and helmets; and they shall set against thee a rampart round about.
**25** And I will set judgment before their face, and they shall execute vengeance upon thee with their judgments; and I will set My jealousy upon thee, and they shall deal with thee in the wrath of My fury. Thy nose and thine ears shall they cut off, and the remnant of thee shall they cast down with the sword. They themselves shall take thy sons and thy daughters, and the remnant of thee shall they burn with fire.
**26** And they shall strip thee of thy raiment, and shall take thy glorious ornaments.
**27** And I will turn away thy impieties from thee, and thy whoredom from the land of Egypt; and thou shalt no more lift up thine eyes unto them, neither shalt thou remember Egypt any more.
**28** For thus saith the Lord, the Lord God: Behold, I deliver thee into the hands of those whom thou dost hate, from whom thy soul hath turned away from them.
**29** And they shall deal with thee in hatred, and shall take all thy labor and thy toil; and thou shalt be naked and exposed, and thy shame, [even] thine own whoredom and thine impiety, shall be uncovered.
**30** And thy whoredom hath wrought these things unto thee, in that thou didst commit whoredom after the nations; and they did defile [themselves] with their lusts.
**31** In the way of thy sister didst thou walk, and I will give her cup into thine hands.
**32** Thus saith Adonai the Lord, the Lord God: Thou shalt drink the cup of thy sister, the deep and the wide [cup]; it shall be for laughter and for derision, that which aboundeth to bring about drunkenness, and thou shalt be filled with utter prostration.
**33** Yea, the cup of thy sister Samaria is a cup of desolation and destruction.
**34** Thou shalt drink it, and shalt drain it to the dregs; and I will turn away her feasts and her new moons, for I have spoken it, saith the Lord, the Lord God.
**35** Therefore thus saith Adonai the Lord: Because thou forgottest Me, and didst cast Me behind thy back, therefore do thou bear thine impiety and thy whoredom.
**36** And the Lord said unto me, "Son of man, wilt thou not judge Oholah and Oholibah?
**37** And shalt declare unto them their iniquities: for they committed adultery, and blood was in their hands; yea, their very thoughts committed adultery, and their children, whom they bore unto Me, did they lead through fire unto them [as burnt offerings].
**38** Moreover, even these things did they do unto Me; and that which they hated, they did. My holy things they defiled, and My sabbaths they profaned;
**39** And when they slew their children to their idols, then they entered into..."
