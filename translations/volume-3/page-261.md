**ΚΕΦ. ΝΖ΄. LVII.**
**1.** ἼΔΕΤΕ ὡς ὁ δίκαιος ἀπώλετο, καὶ οὐδεὶς ἀνὴρ ἐκδέχεται τῇ καρδίᾳ, καὶ ἄνδρες δίκαιοι αἴρονται, καὶ οὐδεὶς κατανοεῖ ἀπὸ
**2.** γὰρ προσώπου ἀδικίας ἤρται ὁ δίκαιος, ἔσται ἐν εἰρήνῃ ἡ ταφὴ αὐτοῦ, ἤρται ἐκ τοῦ μέσου. Ὑμεῖς δὲ προσαγάγετε ὧδε υἱοὶ
**3.** ἄνομοι, σπέρμα μοιχῶν καὶ πόρνης·
**4.** ἐν τίνι ἐνετρυφήσατε; καὶ ἐπὶ τίνα ἠνοίξατε τὸ στόμα ὑμῶν; καὶ ἐπὶ τίνα ἐγαλάσατε τὴν γλῶσσαν ὑμῶν; οὐχ ὑμεῖς ἐστὲ τέκνα ἀπωλείας; σπέρμα ἀνόμων;
**5.** Οἱ παρακαλοῦντες ἐπὶ τὰ εἴδωλα ὑπὸ δένδρα δασέα, σφάζοντες τὰ τέκνα αὐτῶν ἐν ταῖς φάραγξιν ἀναμέσον ἄκρων τῶν πετρῶν ἐν ταῖς μερίσι φάραγγος.
**6.** Ἐκείνη σου ἡ μερίς, οὗτος σου ὁ κλῆρος· κἀκείνοις ἐξέχεας σπονδάς, κἀκείνοις ἀνήνεγκας θυσίας· ἐπὶ τούτοις οὖν οὐκ ὀργισθήσομαι;
**7.** Ἐπ᾽ ὄρος ὑψηλὸν καὶ μετέωρον, ἐκεῖ σου ἡ κοίτη, καὶ ἐκεῖ ἀνεβίβασας θυσίαις θυσίας·
**8.** καὶ ὀπίσω τῶν σταθμῶν τῆς θύρας σου ἔθηκας μνημόσυνά σου. ᾤου, ὅτι ἐὰν ἀπ᾽ ἐμοῦ ἀποστῇς, πλεῖον τι ἕξεις·
**9.** ἐπλάτυνας τὴν κοίτην σου, καὶ διέθου σεαυτῇ παρ᾽ αὐτῶν· ἠγάπησας τοὺς κοιμωμένους μετὰ σοῦ, καὶ ἐπλήθυνας τὴν πορνείαν σου μετ᾽ αὐτῶν, καὶ πολλοὺς ἐποίησας τοὺς μακρὰν ἀπὸ σοῦ, καὶ ἀπέστειλας πρέσβεις ὑπὲρ τὰ ἔριά σου, (καὶ ἀπέστρεψας)
**10.** καὶ ἐταπεινώθης ἕως ᾅδου. Ταῖς πολυοδίαις σου ἐκοπίασας, καὶ οὐκ εἶπας· παύσομαι· ἐνίσχυσας (ὅτι) ἔπραξας ταῦτα, διὰ τοῦτο οὐ κατεδείχθης μοι σύ.
**11.** Τίνα εὐλαβηθεῖσα ἐφοβήθης, καὶ ἐψεύσω με, καὶ οὐκ ἐμνήσθης μου, οὐδὲ ἔλαβές με εἰς τὴν διάνοιαν οὐδὲ εἰς τὴν καρδίαν σου; κἀγώ σε εἶδον παρορῶ, καὶ ἐμέ, οὐκ ἐφοβήθης.
**12.** Κἀγὼ ἀπαγγελῶ τὴν δικαιοσύνην σου, καὶ τὰ κακά σου, ἃ οὐκ ὠφελήσουσι σε·
**13.** ὅταν ἀναβοήσης, ἐξελέσθωσάν σε ἐν τῇ θλίψει σου· τούτους γὰρ πάντας ἄνεμος λήψεται, καὶ ἀποίσει καταιγίς· Οἱ δὲ ἀντεχόμενοι μου κτήσονται γῆν, καὶ κληρονομήσουσι τὸ ὄρος τὸ ἅγιον μου.
**14.** Καὶ ἐροῦσι· καθαρίσατε ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ ἐξοὺς, καὶ ἄρατε σκῶλα ἀπὸ τῆς ὁδοῦ τοῦ λαοῦ μου.
**15.** Ὅτι τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ ὕψιστος, ὁ ἐν ὑψηλοῖς κατοικῶν τὸν αἰῶνα, ἅγιος ἐν ἁγίοις ὄνομα αὐτῷ, (Κύριος) ὕψιστος ἐν ἁγίοις ἀναπαυόμενος, καὶ ὀλιγοψύχοις διδούς μακρο-

#### Chapter 57

**1** Behold, how the righteous one hath perished,
    and no man layeth it to heart;
    and righteous men are taken away,
    and no man doth understand.
**2** For from the face of iniquity is the righteous taken away;
    his burial shall be in peace,
    he is removed from the midst.
**3** But ye, draw near hither, ye lawless sons,
    ye seed of adulterers and a harlot.
**4** In what have ye indulged?
    And against whom have ye opened your mouth?
    And against whom have ye stretched out your tongue?
    Are ye not children of perdition,
    ye seed of lawless ones?
**5** Ye that supplicate unto idols
    under thick trees,
    slaughtering your children in the ravines
    amidst the peaks of the rocks,
    in the recesses of the ravine.
**6** That is thy portion,
    this is thy lot;
    and to them hast thou poured out libations,
    and to them hast thou offered sacrifices.
    Over these things then, shall I not be wroth?
**7** Upon a mountain high and lofty,
    there is thy bed;
    and there didst thou bring up sacrifices upon sacrifices.
**8** And behind the doorposts of thy door
    hast thou set up thy memorials.
    Thou didst suppose that if thou shouldst depart from Me,
    thou wouldst have something more.
**9** Thou didst enlarge thy bed,
    and didst make [a covenant] for thyself with them;
    thou didst love those who lay with thee,
    and multipliedst thy fornication with them;
    and thou didst make many [friends] those afar from thee,
    and sentest ambassadors concerning thy wool;
    (and thou didst turn back)
    and wast humbled even to Hades.
**10** By thy many journeys thou hast wearied thyself,
    and didst not say, "I shall cease."
    Thou wast strengthened, (for that) thou didst these things;
    therefore wert thou not revealed to Me.
**11** Whom hast thou reverenced, having feared,
    that thou didst lie to Me,
    and didst not remember Me,
    nor didst thou take Me into thy mind,
    nor into thy heart?
    And though I saw thee overlooking [Me],
    yet Me thou didst not fear.
**12** I also will declare thy righteousness,
    and thy evil works,
    which shall not profit thee.
**13** When thou shalt cry out,
    let them deliver thee in thy tribulation.
    For the wind shall take all these,
    and a tempest shall carry them away.
    But they that hold fast to Me shall possess the land,
    and shall inherit My holy mountain.
**14** And they shall say:
    "Cleanse ye from his presence the outgrowths,
    and remove the stumbling blocks from the way of My people."
**15** For thus saith the Lord Most High,
    who inhabiteth the high places forever,
    Holy in holies is His name;
    (the Lord) Most High, resting in holies,
    and giving to the faint-hearted long-suffering—
