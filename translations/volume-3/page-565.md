ποιήσεις τοὺς ἀνθρώπους ὡς τοὺς ἰχθύας τῆς θαλάσσης, καὶ ὡς
τὰ ἑρπετὰ οὐκ ἔχοντα ἡγούμενον. Συντέλειαν ἐν ἀγκίστρῳ ἀνέσπασε, 15
καὶ εἵλκυσεν αὐτὸν ἐν ἀμφιβλήστρῳ, καὶ συνήγαγεν αὐτὸν ἐν
ταῖς σαγήναις αὐτοῦ· ἕνεκεν τούτου εὐφρανθήσεται, καὶ χαρήσεται 16
ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ· ἕνεκεν τούτου θύσει τῷ ἀμφιβλήστρῳ αὐτοῦ,
καὶ θυμιάσει τῇ σαγήνῃ αὐτοῦ, ὅτι ἐν αὐτοῖς ἐλίπανε μερίδα
αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰ βρώματα αὐτοῦ ἐκλεκτά· διὰ τοῦτο ἀμφιβαλεῖ 17
τὸ ἀμφίβληστρον αὐτοῦ, καὶ διαπαντὸς ἀποκτείνειν ἔθνη οὐ φείσεται.

ΚΕΦ. Β'. ΙΙ.
Ἐπὶ τῆς φυλακῆς μου στήσομαι, καὶ ἐπιβήσομαι ἐπὶ πέτραν, 1
καὶ ἀποσκοπεύσω τοῦ ἰδεῖν τί λαλήσει ἐν ἐμοί, καὶ τί ἀποκριθῶ
ἐπὶ τὸν ἔλεγχόν μου. Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Κύριος πρὸς με, καὶ εἶπε· 2
γράψον ὅρασιν, καὶ σαφῶς ἐπὶ πυξίον, ὅπως διώκῃ ὁ ἀναγινώσκων
αὐτά. Ὅτι ἔτι ὅρασις εἰς καιρὸν, καὶ ἀνατελεῖ εἰς πέρας, καὶ 3
οὐκ εἰς κενόν· ἐὰν ὑστερήσῃ, ὑπόμεινον αὐτὸν, ὅτι ἐρχόμενος ἥξει,
καὶ οὐ μὴ χρονίσῃ. Ἐὰν ὑποστείληται, οὐκ εὐδοκεῖ ἡ ψυχή μου 4
ἐν αὐτῷ· ὁ δὲ δίκαιός (μου) ἐκ πίστεώς μου ζήσεται. Ὁ δὲ κατοιόμενος, 5
καὶ καταφρονητὴς, ἀνὴρ ἀλαζὼν, οὐδὲν μὴ περάνῃ· ὃς ἐπλάτυνε
καθὼς ὁ ἅδης τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὗτος ὡς θάνατος οὐκ
ἐμπιπλάμενος· καὶ ἐπισυνάξει πρὸς αὐτὸν πάντα τὰ ἔθνη, καὶ
εἰσδέξεται πρὸς αὐτὸν πάντας τοὺς λαούς. Οὐχὶ ταῦτα πάντα 6
παραβολὴν κατ᾿ αὐτοῦ λήψονται, καὶ πρόβλημα εἰς διήγησιν αὐτοῦ;
καὶ ἐροῦσιν· οὐαὶ ὁ πληθύνων αὐτῷ τὰ οὐκ ὄντα αὐτοῦ ἕως τίνος,
καὶ βαρύνων τὸν κλοιὸν αὐτοῦ στιβαρῶς. Ὅτι ἐξαίφνης ἀναστήσονται 7
δάκνοντες αὐτόν· καὶ ἐκνήψουσιν οἱ ἐπίβουλοί σου, καὶ ἔσῃ εἰς
διαρπαγὴν αὐτοῖς. Διότι σὺ ἐσκύλευσας ἔθνη πολλὰ, σκυλεύσουσί 8
σε πάντες οἱ ὑπολελειμμένοι λαοὶ, δι᾽ αἵματα ἀνθρώπων, καὶ
ἀσέβειαν γῆς καὶ πόλεως, καὶ πάντων τῶν κατοικούντων αὐτήν.
Ὦ ὁ πλεονεκτῶν πλεονεξίαν κακὴν τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ, τοῦ τάξαι 9
εἰς ὕψος νοσσιὰν αὐτοῦ, τοῦ ἐκσπασθῆναι ἐκ χειρὸς κακῶν·
ἐβουλεύσω αἰσχύνην τῷ οἴκῳ σου, συνεπέρανας λαοὺς πολλοὺς, 10
καὶ ἐξήμαρτεν ἡ ψυχή σου· διότι λίθος ἐκ τοίχου βοήσεται, καὶ 11
κάνθαρος ἐκ ξύλου φθέγξεται αὐτά. Οὐαὶ ὁ οἰκοδομῶν πόλιν ἐν 12
αἵμασι, καὶ ἑτοιμάζων πόλιν ἐν ἀδικίαις. Οὐ ταῦτά ἐστι παρὰ 13
Κυρίου

**HABAKKUK**
**CHAPTER 1**
**14** Thou wilt make men as the fish of the sea, and as the creeping things which have no ruler.

**15** He hath drawn up all [of them] with a hook, and hath dragged him forth with his casting net, and hath gathered him in his drag-nets.

**16** Therefore shall he be glad, and his heart shall rejoice; because of this, he shall sacrifice unto his casting net, and burn incense unto his drag-net; for by them hath he made fat his portion, and his meats are choice.

**17** Therefore shall he cast his casting net, and shall not spare to slay nations perpetually.

**CHAPTER 2**
**1** Upon my watch I will stand, and I will set myself upon a rock, and will look forth to see what He shall speak within me, and what I shall answer concerning my reproof.

**2** And the Lord answered me, and said: "Write the vision, and make it plain upon a tablet, that he who readeth them may run.

**3** For the vision is yet for a time, and it shall spring forth unto the end, and not in vain; though it tarry, wait thou for it, for it shall surely come, and shall not delay.

**4** If he draw back, My soul hath no pleasure in him; but the righteous [one] (of Me) shall live by My faith."

**5** And the one who supposes, and is a despiser, an arrogant man, he shall accomplish nothing; who hath enlarged his soul as Hades, and he is as death, never to be satisfied; and he shall gather unto himself all nations, and shall receive unto himself all peoples.

**6** Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a problem for his narration? And they shall say, "Woe unto him that multiplieth for himself that which is not his own—how long?—and maketh his yoke heavy with strength!"

**7** For suddenly shall they rise up that bite him; and those who plot against thee shall awake, and thou shalt be for a plunder unto them.

**8** Because thou hast plundered many nations, all the remaining peoples shall plunder thee, for the blood of men, and the impiety of the land and of the city, and of all those who dwell therein.

**9** Woe unto him that coveteth an evil covetousness for his house, to set his nest on high, to be delivered from the hand of evils!

**10** Thou hast counselled shame to thy house; thou hast brought many peoples to an end, and thy soul hath sinned.

**11** For a stone from the wall shall cry out, and a beetle from the wood shall utter these things.

**12** Woe unto him that buildeth a city with blood, and prepareth a city with iniquities!

**13** Are not these things from the Lord...
