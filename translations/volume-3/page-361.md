ἄρχοντας. Καὶ ἐπικράνθησαν οἱ ἄρχοντες ἐπὶ Ἱερεμίαν, καὶ 15
ἐπάταξαν αὐτόν, καὶ ἀπέστειλαν αὐτὸν εἰς οἶκον φυλακῆς,
τὴν οἰκίαν Ἰωνάθαν τοῦ γραμματέως, ὅτι ταύτην ἐποίησαν
εἰς οἶκον φυλακῆς. Καὶ ἦλθεν Ἱερεμίας εἰς οἰκίαν τοῦ λάκκου, 16
καὶ εἰς τὴν Χερέβ, καὶ ἐκάθισεν ἐκεῖ ἡμέρας πολλάς. Καὶ ἀπέ- 17
στειλεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Σεδεκίας, καὶ ἐκάλεσεν αὐτόν, καὶ ἐπηρώ-
τησεν αὐτὸν ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ αὐτοῦ κρυφαίως εἰπεῖν, εἰ
ἔστι λόγος παρὰ Κυρίου; καὶ εἶπεν (αὐτῷ) Ἱερεμίας· ἔστι. Καὶ
εἶπεν· εἰς χεῖρας βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος παραδοθήσῃ. Καὶ εἶπεν 18
Ἱερεμίας τῷ βασιλεῖ· τί ἠδίκησά σε, καὶ τοὺς παῖδάς σου, καὶ
τὸν λαὸν τοῦτον, ὅτι σὺ δίδως με εἰς οἰκίαν τῆς φυλακῆς; Καὶ 19
ποῦ εἰσιν οἱ προφῆται ὑμῶν οἱ προφητεύσαντες ὑμῖν, λέγοντες,
ὅτι οὐ μὴ ἔλθῃ βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν
ταύτην; Καὶ νῦν ἄκουσον δὴ Κύριέ μου βασιλεῦ, πεσέτω δὴ τὸ 20
ἔλεός μου κατὰ πρόσωπόν σου· καὶ τί ἀποστρέφεις με εἰς οἰκίαν
Ἰωνάθαν τοῦ γραμματέως, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἀποθάνω ἐκεῖ; Καὶ συνέ- 21
ταξεν ὁ βασιλεύς, καὶ ἐνέβαλοσαν αὐτὸν εἰς οἰκίαν τῆς φυλα-
κῆς, καὶ ἐδίδoσαν αὐτῷ ἄρτον ἕνα τῆς ἡμέρας, ἔξωθεν οὐ πέ-
σουσιν, ἕως ἐξέλιπον οἱ ἄρτοι ἐκ τῆς πόλεως· καὶ ἐκάθισεν Ἱε-
ρεμίας ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ τῆς φυλακῆς.

ΚΑΙ ἤκουσε Σαφανίας υἱὸς Νάθαν, καὶ Γοδολίας υἱὸς Πα- 1
σχώρ, καὶ Ἰωάχαλ υἱὸς Ἐλεμίου, καὶ Φασχὼρ υἱὸς Μελχίου,
τοὺς λόγους, οὓς ἐλάλησεν Ἱερεμίας ἐπὶ πάντα τὸν λαόν, λέ-
γων, οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος· ὁ κατοικῶν ἐν τῇ πόλει ταύτῃ, ἀπο- 2
θανεῖται ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ, καὶ ἐν λιμῷ, καὶ ἐν θανάτῳ· καὶ ὁ ἐκπο-
ρευόμενος πρὸς τοὺς Χαλδαίους ζήσεται, καὶ ἔσται ἡ ψυχὴ αὐ-
τοῦ εἰς εὕρημα, καὶ ζήσεται. Ὅτι οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος· παρα- 3
διδομένη παραδοθήσεται πόλις αὕτη εἰς χεῖρας δυνάμεως βα-
σιλέως Βαβυλῶνος, καὶ συλλήψεται αὐτήν. Καὶ εἶπαν οἱ ἄρχον- 4
τες τῷ βασιλεῖ· ἀναιρεθήτω δὴ ὁ ἄνθρωπος ἐκεῖνος, ὅτι αὐτὸς
ἐκλύει τὰς χεῖρας τῶν ἀνθρώπων τῶν πολεμιστῶν τῶν καταλε-
λειμμένων ἐν τῇ πόλει ταύτῃ, καὶ τὰς χεῖρας παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ,

**17** And Zedekiah the king sent and called him; and the king questioned him secretly in his house, saying, "Is there any word from the Lord?" And Jeremiah said [unto him], "There is." And he said, "Into the hands of the king of Babylon shalt thou be delivered." **18** Then Jeremiah said unto the king, "What wrong have I done thee, or thy servants, or this people, that thou dost put me into the house of the prison? **19** And where are your prophets who prophesied unto you, saying, 'The king of Babylon shall surely not come against you, nor against this land'?" **20** "And now, I beseech thee, O my lord the king, let my plea for mercy come before thy countenance; and why dost thou return me unto the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there?" **21** And the king gave commandment, and they cast him into the house of custody, and they gave him one loaf of bread each day; from outside they shall not fall, until the loaves failed from the city; and Jeremiah sat in the court of the prison.

**JEREMIAH 45 (Septuagint) / JEREMIAH 38 (Hebrew)**

**1** Now Saphanias, the son of Nathan, and Godolias, the son of Paschor, and Ioachal, the son of Elemiah, and Paschor, the son of Melchiou, heard the words which Jeremiah spake unto all the people, saying, **2** "Thus saith the Lord: 'He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by famine, and by pestilence; but he that goeth forth unto the Chaldeans shall live, and his soul shall be unto him as a prize, and he shall live.'" **3** For thus saith the Lord: 'This city shall surely be delivered into the hands of the army of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it.' "

**4** Then said the chiefs unto the king, "Let this man, we pray thee, be put to death, because he weakeneth the hands of the men, the warriors who are left in this city, and the hands of all the people,
