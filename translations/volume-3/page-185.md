**1** ΤΙΣ δῴη σε ἀδελφιδέ μου θηλάζοντα μαστοὺς μητρός μου; εὑροῦσά σε ἔξω φιλήσω σε, καὶ γε οὐκ ἐξουδενώσουσί μοι.
**2** Παραλήψομαί σε, εἰσάξω σε εἰς οἶκον μητρός μου καὶ εἰς ταμιεῖον τῆς συλλαβούσης με· ποτιῶ σε ἀπὸ οἴνου τοῦ μυρεψικοῦ, ἀπὸ νάματος ῥοῶν μου.
**3** Εὐώνυμος αὐτοῦ ὑπὸ τὴν κεφαλήν μου, καὶ δεξιὰ αὐτοῦ περιλήψεται με.
**4** Ὅρκισα ὑμᾶς θυγατέρες Ἱερουσαλήμ ἐν ταῖς δυνάμεσι καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἰσχύσεσι τοῦ ἀγροῦ· τί ἐγείρητε καὶ τί ἐξεγείρητε τὴν ἀγάπην ἕως ἂν θελήσῃ.
**5** Τίς αὕτη ἡ ἀναβαίνουσα λευκανθισμένη, ἐπιστηριζομένη ἐπὶ τὸν ἀδελφιδὸν αὐτῆς; ὑπὸ μῆλον ἐξήγειρά σε· ἐκεῖ ὠδίνῃσέ σε ἡ μήτηρ σου, ἐκεῖ ὠδίνῃσέ σε ἡ τεκοῦσά σε.
**6** Θές με ὡς σφραγῖδα ἐπὶ τὴν καρδίαν σου, ὡς σφραγῖδα ἐπὶ τὸν βραχίονά σου· ὅτι κραταιὰ ὡς θάνατος ἀγάπη, σκληρὸς ὡς ᾅδης ζῆλος· περίπτερα αὐτῆς περίπτερα πυρός, φλόγες αὐτῆς·
**7** ὕδωρ πολὺ οὐ δυνήσεται σβέσαι τὴν ἀγάπην, καὶ ποταμοὶ οὐ συγκλύσουσιν αὐτήν· ἐὰν δῷ ἀνὴρ τὸν πάντα βίον αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ ἀγάπῃ, ἐξουδενῶν ἐξουδενώσουσιν αὐτόν.
**8** Ἀδελφὴ ἡμῶν μικρά, καὶ μαστοὺς οὐκ ἔχει· τί ποιήσωμεν τῇ ἀδελφῇ ἡμῶν, ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ᾗ ἂν λαληθῇ ἐν αὐτῇ;
**9** Εἰ τεῖχος ἔστιν, οἰκοδομήσωμεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὴν ἐπαύλεις ἀργυρᾶς· καὶ εἰ θύρα ἐστι, διαγράψωμεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὴν σανίδα κεδρίνην.
**10** Ἐγὼ τεῖχος, καὶ μαστοί μου ὡς πύργοι· ἐγὼ ἤμην ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτοῦ ὡς εὑρίσκουσα εἰρήνην.
**11** Ἀμπελὼν ἐγενήθη τῷ Σαλωμὼν ἐν Βεελαμών· ἔδωκε τὸν ἀμπελῶνα αὐτοῦ τοῖς τηροῦσιν· ἀνὴρ οἴσει ἐν καρπῷ αὐτοῦ χιλίους ἀργυρίου.
**12** Ἀμπελὼν μου ἐμὸς ἐνώπιον μου· οἱ χίλιοι τῷ Σαλωμών, καὶ οἱ διακόσιοι τοῖς τηροῦσι τὸν καρπὸν αὐτοῦ.
**13** Ὁ καθήμενος ἐν κήποις, ἑταῖροι προσέχοντες τῇ φωνῇ σου· ἀκούτισόν με.
**14** Φύγε ἀδελφιδέ μου, καὶ ὁμοιώθητι τῇ δορκάδι ἢ τῷ νεβρῷ τῶν ἐλάφων ἐπὶ τὰ ὄρη ἀρωμάτων.

**THE SONG OF SONGS.**
**CHAPTER 8.**

**1** Oh that thou wert as my brother,
    That hath sucked the breasts of my mother!
    If I should find thee outside, I would kiss thee;
    Yea, none would despise me.
**2** I will take thee and bring thee into the house of my mother,
    And into the chamber of her that conceived me;
    I will cause thee to drink of spiced wine,
    Of the juice of my pomegranates.
**3** His left hand shall be under my head,
    And his right hand shall embrace me.
**4** I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
    By the powers and by the strengths of the field,
    That ye awaken not, nor stir up love,
    Until it pleaseth!
**5** Who is this that cometh up, made white,
    Leaning upon her beloved?
    Beneath the apple tree did I awaken thee;
    There thy mother travailed with thee,
    There she that bore thee travailed with thee.
**6** Set me as a seal upon thine heart,
    As a seal upon thine arm;
    For love is strong as death,
    Jealousy is cruel as Hades;
    Its flashes are flashes of fire,
    Its very flames.
**7** Many waters cannot quench love,
    Neither can rivers drown it.
    If a man would give all the substance of his house for love,
    They would utterly despise him.
**8** We have a little sister,
    And she hath no breasts:
    What shall we do for our sister
    In the day when she shall be spoken for?
**9** If she be a wall,
    We will build upon her battlements of silver;
    And if she be a door,
    We will enclose her with a board of cedar.
**10** I am a wall,
    And my breasts are like towers;
    I was in his eyes as one that findeth peace.
**11** A vineyard was for Solomon in Baal-hamon;
    He gave the vineyard unto its keepers:
    Each man shall bring for its fruit
    A thousand [shekels] of silver.
**12** My vineyard, which is mine, is before me:
    The thousand [shekels] are for Solomon,
    And the two hundred for those that keep its fruit.
**13** O thou that dwellest in the gardens,
    The companions hearken to thy voice:
    Cause me to hear it.
**14** Make haste, my beloved,
    And be thou like to a roe,
    Or to a young hart,
    Upon the mountains of spices.
