ΚΕΦ. ΛΒʹ. ΛΓʹ. ΗΣΑΙΑΣ.
νοὺς ἐν λόγοις ἀδίκοις, καὶ διασκεδάσαι λόγους ταπεινῶν ἐν
κρίσει. Οἱ δὲ εὐσεβεῖς συνετὰ ἐβουλεύσαντο, καὶ αὕτη ἡ βουλὴ 8
μένει. Γυναῖκες πλούσιαι, ἀνάστητε δὴ, καὶ ἀκούσατε τῆς φω- 9
νῆς μου, θυγατέρες, ἐν ἐλπίδι ἀκούσατε τοὺς λόγους μου·
ἡμέρας ἐνιαυτοῦ μνείαν ποιήσασθε ἐν ὀδύνῃ μετὰ ἐλπίδος· 10
ἀνήλωται ὁ τρυγητὸς, πέπαυται ὁ σπόρος, καὶ οὐκέτι μὴ ἔλθῃ.
Εὐθηνοῦσαι ἔκστητε, λυπήθητε αἱ πεποιθυῖαι, ἐκδύσασθε, γυ- 11
μναὶ γένεσθε, περιζώσασθε σάκκους τὰς ὀσφύας, καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν 12
μαστῶν κόπτεσθε, περὶ ἀγροῦ ἐπιθυμήματος, καὶ ἀμπέλου
γεννήματος. Ἐπὶ γῆν τοῦ λαοῦ μου ἄκανθα καὶ χόρτος ἀναβή- 13
σεται, καὶ ἐκ πάσης οἰκίας εὐφροσύνη ἀρθήσεται, πόλις πλουσία·
οἶκοι ἐγκαταλελειμμένοι πλοῦτον πόλεως καὶ οἴκους ἐπιθυμη- 14
τοὺς ἀφήσουσι· καὶ ἔσονται αἱ κῶμαι σπήλαια ἕως τοῦ αἰῶ-
νος, εὐφροσύνη ὄνων ἀγρίων, βοσκήματα ποιμένων· ἕως ἂν ἐ- 15
πέλθῃ ἐφ’ ἡμᾶς πνεῦμα ἀφ’ ὑψηλοῦ, καὶ ἔσται ἔρημος ὁ Χέρμελ,
καὶ ὁ Χέρμελ εἰς δρυμὸν λογισθήσεται. Καὶ ἀναπαύσεται ἐν 16
τῇ ἐρήμῳ κρίμα, καὶ δικαιοσύνη ἐν τῷ Καρμήλῳ κατοικήσει·
καὶ ἔσται τὰ ἔργα τῆς δικαιοσύνης, εἰρήνη, καὶ κρατήσει ἡ 17
δικαιοσύνη ἀνάπαυσιν, καὶ πεποιθότες ἔσονται ἕως τοῦ αἰῶνος·
καὶ κατοικήσει ὁ λαὸς αὐτοῦ ἐν πόλει εἰρήνης, καὶ ἐνοικήσει πεποι- 18
θῶς, καὶ ἀναπαύσονται μετὰ πλούτου. Ἦ δὲ χάλαζα ἐὰν καταβῇ, 19
οὐκ ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς ἥξει· καὶ ἔσονται οἱ ἐνοικοῦντες ἐν τοῖς δρυμοῖς
πεποιθότες, ὡς οἱ ἐν τῇ πεδινῇ. Μακάριοι οἱ σπείροντες ἐπὶ 20
πᾶν ὕδωρ, οὐ βοῦς καὶ ὄνος πατεῖ.

ΚΕΦ. ΛΓʹ. XXXIII.
ΟΥΑΙ τοῖς ταλαιπωροῦσιν ὑμᾶς, ὑμᾶς δὲ οὐδεὶς ποιεῖ 1
ταλαιπώρους, καὶ ὁ ἀθετῶν ὑμᾶς οὐκ ἀθετεῖ· ἁλώσονται οἱ ἀ-
θετοῦντες, καὶ παραδοθήσονται, καὶ ὡς σὴς ἐφ᾽ ἱματίου, οὕτως
φθαρθήσονται. Κύριε, ἐλέησον ἡμᾶς, ἐπὶ σοὶ γὰρ πεποίθαμεν· 2
ἐγενήθη τὸ σπέρμα τῶν ἀπειθούντων εἰς ἀπώλειαν, ἡ δὲ σω-
τηρία ἡμῶν ἐν καιρῷ θλίψεως. Διὰ φωνὴν τοῦ φόβου σου ἐξέ- 3
στησαν λαοὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ φόβου σου, καὶ διεσπάρησαν τὰ ἔθνη, νῦν 4
δὲ συναχθήσεται τὰ σκῦλα ὑμῶν ἀπὸ μικροῦ καὶ μεγάλου· ὃν
τρόπον ἐάν τις συναγάγῃ ἀκρίδας, οὕτως ἐμπαίζονται ὑμῖν.

**Chapter 32**
*cont.* the humble with unrighteous words, and to scatter the words of the lowly in judgment.
**8** But the godly have counselled prudently, and this counsel shall stand.
**9** Ye prosperous women, rise up, and hearken unto My voice; ye daughters, in hope give ear unto My words.
**10** Ye shall call to mind the days of a year in anguish, yet with hope; for the vintage is consumed, the sowing is ceased, and it shall no more return.
**11** Ye complacent ones, stand astonished; be ye grieved, ye confident ones; strip yourselves, make yourselves bare,
**12** and gird sackcloth upon your loins; and upon your breasts smite ye yourselves, for the fields of desire, and for the fruit of the vine.
**13** Upon the land of My people shall thorns and thistles come up, and from every house shall joy be taken away, O prosperous city.
**14** Abandoned houses shall yield up the city's wealth and desirable dwellings; and the villages shall become caves for ever, a joy for wild asses, a pasture for shepherds;
**15** until the Spirit from on high be poured out upon us, and Chermel shall become a wilderness, and Chermel shall be counted for a forest.
**16** Then shall judgment rest in the wilderness, and righteousness shall abide in Carmel.
**17** And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and righteousness shall hold sway over rest, and they shall be confident for ever.
**18** And His people shall dwell in a city of peace, and shall abide in confidence, and they shall rest in abundance.
**19** But if hail descend, it shall not come upon you; and those that dwell in the forests shall be confident, as those in the plain.
**20** Blessed are they that sow beside all waters, where no ox or ass doth tread.

**Chapter 33**
**1** Woe unto them that trouble you, yet no man troubleth you; and he that dealeth treacherously with you, yet dealeth not treacherously [against you]. The treacherous ones shall be taken, and shall be delivered up; and as a moth upon a garment, so shall they be destroyed.
**2** O Lord, have mercy upon us; for in Thee have we trusted. The offspring of the disobedient hath become for destruction; but our salvation is in the time of tribulation.
**3** By the sound of Thy dreadful voice, the peoples were cast down by Thy dread, and the nations were scattered abroad.
**4** But now shall your spoil be gathered, both small and great; in the manner that one gathereth locusts, so shall they be made sport of by you.
