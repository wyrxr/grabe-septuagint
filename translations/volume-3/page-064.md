**ΨΑΛΜ. ΠΓʹ. LXXXIII.**
    4 ἡ σάρξ μου ἠγαλλιάσαντο ἐπὶ Θεὸν ζῶντα. Καὶ γὰρ σρουθίον εὗ-
    ρεν ἑαυτῷ οἰκίαν, καὶ τρυγὼν νοσσιὰν ἑαυτῇ, οὗ θήσει τὰ νοσσία
    ἑαυτῆς· τὰ θυσιαστήριά σου Κύριε τῶν δυνάμεων, ὁ βασιλεύς μου
5 καὶ ὁ Θεός μου. Μακάριοι (πάντες) οἱ κατοικοῦντες ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ
6 σου· εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων αἰνέσοισί σε. Διάψαλμα. Μα-
    κάριος ἀνὴρ οὗ ἐστιν ἀντίληψις αὐτοῦ παρὰ σοῦ Κύριε· ἀναβάσεις
7 ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ διέθετο εἰς τὴν κοιλάδα τοῦ κλαυθμῶνος, εἰς
8 τόπον ὃν ἔθετο· καὶ γὰρ εὐλογίας δώσει ὁ νομοθετῶν. Πορεύσον-
    ται ἐκ δυνάμεως εἰς δύναμιν· ὀφθήσεται ὁ Θεὸς τῶν θεῶν ἐν Σιών.
9 Κύριε ὁ Θεὸς τῶν δυναιέων εἰσάκουσον τῆς προσευχῆς μου· ἐνώ-
10 τισαι ὁ Θεὸς Ἰακώβ. Διάψαλμα. Ὑπερασπιστά ἡμῶν ἴδε ὁ Θεός,
11 καὶ ἐπίβλεψον ἐπὶ τὸ πρόσωπον τοῦ χριστοῦ σου. Ὅτι κρείσσων
    ἡμέρα μία ἐν ταῖς αὐλαῖς σου ὑπὲρ χιλιάδας· ἐξελεξάμην παραρί-
    πτεσθαι ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ Θεοῦ μου μᾶλλον ἢ οἰκεῖν ἐν σκηνώμασιν
12 ἁμαρτωλῶν. Ὅτι ἔλεον καὶ ἀλήθειαν ἀγαπᾷ Κύριος ὁ Θεός, χά-
    ριν καὶ δόξαν δώσει· Κύριος οὐχ ὑστερήσει τὰ ἀγαθὰ τοὺς πο-
13 ρευομένους ἐν ἀκακίᾳ. Κύριε τῶν δυνάμεων, μακάριος ἄνθρωπος
    ὁ ἐλπίζων ἐπὶ σέ.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ΠΔʹ. LXXXIV.**

1.2 ΕΙΣ τὸ τέλος, τοῖς υἱοῖς Κορὲ ψαλμός. Εὐδόκησας Κύριε τὴν
3 γῆν σου, ἐπέστρεψας τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν Ἰακώβ. Ἀφῆκας τὰς ἀνο-
    μίας τῷ λαῷ σου, ἐκάλυψας πάσας τὰς ἁμαρτίας αὐτῶν. Διά-
4 ψαλμα. Κατέπαυσας πᾶσαν τὴν ὀργήν σου, ἀπέστρεψας ἀπὸ ὀρ-
5 γῆς θυμοῦ σου. Ἐπίστρεψον ἡμᾶς ὁ Θεὸς τῶν σωτηρίων ἡμῶν,
6 καὶ ἀπόστρεψον τὸν θυμόν σου ἀφ᾽ ἡμῶν. Μὴ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα ὀργι-
7 σθῇς ἡμῖν; ἢ διατενεῖς τὴν ὀργήν σου ἀπὸ γενεᾶς εἰς γενεάν; Ὁ
    Θεός, σὺ ἐπιστρέψας ζώσεῖς ἡμᾶς, καὶ ὁ λαός σου εὐφρανθήσε-
8 ται ἐπὶ σοί. Δεῖξον ἡμῖν Κύριε τὸ ἔλεός σου, καὶ τὸ σωτήριόν
9 σου (Κύριε) δῴης ἡμῖν. Ἀκούσομαι τί λαλήσει ἐν ἐμοὶ Κύριος ὁ
    Θεός· ὅτι λαλήσει εἰρήνην ἐπὶ τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς ὁσίους
10 αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς ἐπιστρέφοντας πρὸς αὐτὸν καρδίαν. Πλὴν ἐγ-
    γὺς τῶν φοβουμένων αὐτὸν τὸ σωτήριον αὐτοῦ, τοῦ κατασκηνῶσαι
11 δόξαν ἐν τῇ γῇ ἡμῶν. Ἔλεος καὶ ἀλήθεια συνήντησαν, δικαιοσύνη

**PSALM LXXXIII. (Cont.)**
4 ...my flesh have rejoiced in the living God.
For indeed a sparrow hath found herself a house,
And a turtle-dove a nest for herself, where she shall lay her young;
[Even] Thine altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God.
5 Blessed are all they that dwell in Thy house:
For ever and ever shall they praise Thee. *Pause*.
6 Blessed is the man whose help is from Thee, O Lord.
7 He hath purposed ascents in his heart,
Even to the valley of weeping, to the place which he hath appointed;
For the Lawgiver shall give blessings.
8 They shall go from strength to strength;
The God of gods shall be seen in Zion.
9 O Lord, God of hosts, hear my prayer;
Give ear, O God of Jacob. *Pause*.
10 Behold, O God, our Defender,
And look upon the face of Thine Anointed.
11 For one day in Thy courts is better than thousands.
I have chosen rather to be cast down by the threshold of the house of my God,
Than to dwell in the tabernacles of sinners.
12 For the Lord God loveth mercy and truth;
Grace and glory shall He give.
The Lord shall not withhold good things from them that walk in blamelessness.
13 O Lord of hosts, blessed is the man that hopeth in Thee.

**PSALM LXXXIV.**
1-2 Unto the End, a Psalm for the sons of Korah.
Thou hast been favorable unto Thy land, O Lord;
Thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob.
3 Thou hast forgiven the iniquities of Thy people;
Thou hast covered all their sins. *Pause*.
4 Thou hast appeased all Thy wrath;
Thou hast turned away from the fierceness of Thine anger.
5 Turn us, O God of our salvation,
And turn away Thine indignation from us.
6 Wilt Thou be wroth with us forever?
Or wilt Thou draw out Thy wrath from generation to generation?
7 O God, Thou shalt turn [unto us] and make us live,
And Thy people shall rejoice in Thee.
8 Show us Thy mercy, O Lord,
And grant us Thy salvation, O Lord.
9 I will hear what the Lord God will speak within me;
For He will speak peace unto His people,
And unto His saints,
And unto those who turn their heart to Him.
10 Surely His salvation is nigh unto them that fear Him,
That glory may dwell in our land.
11 Mercy and truth have met together; righteousness
