**ΚΕΦ. Κ´. ΙΕΡΕΜΙΑΣ 1247**

**15** κατάρατος ὁ ἄνθρωπος ὁ εὐαγγελισάμενος τῷ πατρί μου, λέγων,
**16** ἐτέχθη σοι υἱὸς ἄρσην, εὐφραινόμενος εὔφρανεν αὐτόν· ἔσται δ᾽
ἄνθρωπος ἐκεῖνος, ὡς αἱ πόλεις ἃς κατέστρεψε Κύριος ἐν θυμῷ,
καὶ οὐ μετεμελήθη· ἀκουσάτω κραυγῆς τῷ πρωΐ, καὶ ἀλαλαγμοῦ
**17** ἐν καιρῷ μεσημβρίας, ὅτι οὐκ ἀπέκτεινέ με ἐν μήτρα μητρός,
καὶ ἐγένετό μοι ἡ μήτηρ μου τάφος μου, καὶ ἡ μήτρα συλλήψεως
αἰωνίας.
**18** Ἰνατί τοῦτο ἐξῆλθον ἐκ μήτρας, τοῦ βλέπειν
κόπους καὶ πόνους, καὶ διέτελεσαν ἐν αἰσχύνῃ αἱ ἡμέραι μου;

**2** Ἐπερώτησον περὶ ἡμῶν τὸν Κύριον, ὅτι Ναβουχοδονόσορ (ὁ)
βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος ἐφέστηκεν ἐφ᾽ ἡμᾶς, εἰ πως ποιήσει Κύριος

ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ μεταστρέφω τὰ ὅπλα τὰ πολεμικὰ τὰ ἐν ταῖς
χερσὶν ὑμῶν, ἐν οἷς ὑμεῖς πολεμεῖτε ἐν αὐτοῖς πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα
Βαβυλῶνος καὶ τοὺς Χαλδαίους τοὺς συγκλείοντας ὑμᾶς

ἐν βραχίονι κραταιῷ μετὰ θυμοῦ καὶ ὀργῆς καὶ παροργισμοῦ
μεγάλου.
**6** Καὶ πατάξω πάντας τοὺς κατοικοῦντας ἐν τῇ πόλει
ταύτῃ, τοὺς ἀνθρώπους καὶ τὰ κτῆνη ἐν θανάτῳ μεγάλῳ, καὶ
ἀποθανοῦνται.
**7** Καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα, οὕτως λέγει Κύριος· δώσω τὸν
Σεδεκίαν βασιλέα Ἰούδα, καὶ τοὺς παῖδας αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὸν λαὸν
τὸν καταλειφθέντα ἐν τῇ πόλει ταύτῃ, ἀπὸ τοῦ θανάτου καὶ ἀπὸ
τοῦ λιμοῦ καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς μαχαίρας, ἐν χειρὶ Ναβουχοδονόσορ βασιλέως
Βαβυλῶνος, καὶ ἐν χειρὶ ἐχθρῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐν χειρὶ τῶν ζητούντων
τὰς ψυχὰς αὐτῶν, καὶ κατακόψουσιν αὐτοὺς ἐν στόματι μαχαίρας·
**8** οὐ φείσομαι ἐπ᾽ αὐτοῖς, καὶ οὐ μὴ οἰκτειρήσω αὐτούς. Καὶ
πρὸς τὸν λαὸν τοῦτον ἐρεῖς· τάδε λέγει Κύριος· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ δέδωκα πρὸ

### JEREMIAH 20

**15** Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying,
**16** 'A male child is born unto thee,' making him exceeding glad. That man shall be as the cities which the Lord overthrew in wrath, and repented not. Let him hear a cry in the morning, and a shouting
**17** in the time of noon, because he slew me not in the womb of my mother, and my mother became my tomb, and the womb of [my] eternal confinement.
**18** Wherefore came I forth from the womb, to see labours and sorrows, and my days have ended in shame?

### JEREMIAH 21

**1** THE WORD WHICH CAME UNTO JEREMIAH FROM THE LORD, WHEN ZEDEKIAH THE KING SENT UNTO HIM PASHHUR THE SON OF MELCHIAH, AND ZEPHANIAH THE SON OF MAASSEIAH THE PRIEST, SAYING,
**2** 'Enquire, we pray thee, of the Lord for us; for Nebuchadnezzar (the) king of Babylon hath risen up against us. If, peradventure, the Lord will deal with us according to all His wondrous works, then shall he depart from us.'
**3** Then said Jeremiah unto them, 'Thus shall ye say
**4** unto Zedekiah king of Judah: Thus saith the Lord God of Israel: Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, with which ye fight against the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans, who besiege you from without the wall; and I will gather them into the midst of this city.
**5** And I Myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand, and with a mighty arm, with fury and wrath and great indignation.
**6** And I will smite all them that dwell in this city, both man and beast, with a great death, and they shall die.
**7** And after these things, thus saith the Lord: I will give Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his servants, and the people that are left in this city from the death, and from the famine, and from the sword, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their lives; and they shall smite them with the edge of the sword.
**8** I will not spare them, neither will I pity them. And unto this people shalt thou say: Thus saith the Lord: Behold, I have set before your face [the] way of life, and [the] way of death.'
