ΚΕΦ. ΙϚʹ. ΙΕΡΕΜΙΑΣ 1241
αὐτούς, ἀνθ᾿ ὧν ἐγκατέλιπόν με οἱ πατέρες ὑμῶν, λέγει Κύριος,
καὶ ᾤχοντο ὀπίσω θεῶν ἀλλοτρίων, καὶ ἐδούλευσαν αὐτοῖς, καὶ
προσεκύνησαν αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἐμὲ ἐγκατέλιπον, καὶ τὸν νόμον μου
οὐκ ἐφυλάξαντο, καὶ ὑμεῖς ἐπονηρεύσασθε τοῦ ποιῆσαι ὑπὲρ τοὺς 12
πατέρας ὑμῶν· καὶ ἰδοὺ ὑμεῖς πορεύεσθε ἕκαστος ὀπίσω τῶν ἀρε-
στῶν τῆς καρδίας ὑμῶν τῆς πονηρᾶς, τοῦ μὴ ὑπακούειν μου. Καὶ 13
ἀποῤῥίψω ὑμᾶς ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς ταύτης εἰς τὴν γῆν, ἣν οὐκ ᾔδειτε
ὑμεῖς καὶ οἱ πατέρες ὑμῶν, καὶ δουλεύσετε ἐκεῖ θεοῖς ἑτέροις ἡ-
μέρας καὶ νυκτός, οἳ οὐ δώσουσιν ὑμῖν ἔλεος. Διὰ τοῦτο ἰδοὺ 14
ἡμέραι ἔρχονται, λέγει Κύριος, καὶ οὐκ ἐροῦσιν ἔτι, ζῇ Κύριος
ὁ ἀναγαγὼν τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου· ἀλλὰ ζῇ Κύ- 15
ριος, ὃς ἀνήγαγε τὸν οἶκον Ἰσραὴλ ἀπὸ γῆς βορρᾶ, καὶ ἀπὸ πα-
σῶν τῶν χωρῶν οὗ ἐξώσθησαν ἐκεῖ, καὶ ἀποκαταστήσω αὐτοὺς
εἰς τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν, ἣν ἔδωκα τοῖς πατράσιν αὐτῶν. Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ 16
ἀποστέλλω τοὺς ἁλιεῖς τοὺς πολλούς, λέγει Κύριος, καὶ ἁλιεύ-
σουσιν αὐτούς· καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα ἀποστελῶ τοὺς πολλοὺς θηρευ-
τάς, καὶ θηρεύσουσιν αὐτοὺς ἐπάνω παντὸς ὄρους, καὶ ἐπάνω
παντὸς βουνοῦ ὑψηλοῦ, καὶ ἐκ τῶν τρυμαλιῶν τῶν πετρῶν. Ὅτι 17
οἱ ὀφθαλμοί μου ἐπὶ πάσας τὰς ὁδοὺς αὐτῶν· οὐκ ἐκρύβησαν
ἀπὸ προσώπου μου, καὶ οὐκ ἐκρύβη τὰ ἀδικήματα αὐτῶν ἀπέ-
ναντι τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν μου. Καὶ ἀνταποδώσω πρῶτον διπλᾶς τὰς 18
ἀδικίας αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰς ἁμαρτίας αὐτῶν, ἐφ᾿ αἷς ἐβεβήλωσαν
τὴν γῆν μου ἐν τοῖς βησιμαίοις τῶν βδελυγμάτων αὐτῶν καὶ
ἐν ταῖς ἀνομίαις αὐτῶν, ἐν αἷς ἐπλημμέλησαν τὴν κληρονομίαν
μου. Κύριε, ἰσχύς μου, καὶ βοήθειά μου, καὶ καταφυγή μου ἐν 19
ἡμέραις κακῶν· πρὸς σὲ ἔθνη ἥξουσιν ἀπ᾿ ἐσχάτου τῆς γῆς, καὶ
ἐροῦσιν, ὡς ψευδῆ ἐκτήσαντο οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν εἴδωλα, καὶ οὐκ
ἔστιν ἐν αὐτοῖς ὠφέλημα. Εἰ ποιήσει ἑαυτῷ ἄνθρωπος θεούς, 20
καὶ οὗτοι οὐκ εἰσὶ θεοί; Διὰ τοῦτο ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ δηλώσω αὐτοῖς ἐν 21
τῷ καιρῷ τούτῳ τὴν χεῖρά μου, καὶ γνωριῶ αὐτοῖς τὴν δύναμιν
μου, καὶ γνώσονται, ὅτι ὄνομά μοι Κύριος.

### JEREMIAH 16

**11** them: "Because your fathers have forsaken Me, saith the Lord, and have walked after other gods, and have served them, and have worshipped them, and have forsaken Me, and have not kept My law;
**12** and ye have done evil to do worse than your fathers; for, behold, ye walk every one after the stubbornness of your evil heart, that ye may not hearken unto Me.
**13** And I will cast you out of this land into a land which neither ye nor your fathers have known; and there shall ye serve other gods day and night, who shall show you no mercy.
**14** Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that they shall no more say, 'The Lord liveth, who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;'
**15** but, 'The Lord liveth, who brought up the house of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the lands whither they were driven thence.' And I will restore them unto their own land which I gave unto their fathers.
**16** Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith the Lord, and they shall fish them; and after that will I send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every high hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.
**17** For Mine eyes are upon all their ways; they are not hid from My face, neither is their iniquity hidden from before My eyes.
**18** And I will first recompense their iniquities doubly, and their sins, for all wherein they have defiled My land with the abominable cultic places of their detestable things and with their lawless deeds, in which they have grievously trespassed against My inheritance."
**19** O Lord, my strength and my helper, and my refuge in the day of evils, unto Thee shall the nations come from the uttermost parts of the earth, and shall say, "Surely our fathers have inherited lies, even idols wherein there is no profit.
**20** Shall a man make gods for himself, and these are no gods?"
**21** Therefore, behold, I will cause them to know at this time My hand, and I will make them know My power, and they shall know that My Name is Lord.

**1** The sin of Judah is written with a writing stylus, even with an adamantine point, engraved upon the tablet of their heart, and upon the horns of their altars.
