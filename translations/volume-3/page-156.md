**7** λόγοις αὐτοῦ, ἵνα μὴ ἐλέγξῃ σε, καὶ ψευδὴς γένη.
**8** Δύο αἰτοῦμαι παρὰ σοῦ, μὴ ἀφέλῃς μου χάριν, πρὸ τοῦ ἀποθανεῖν με· μάταιον μοι δῷς·
**9** σύνταξον δέ μοι (πάντα) τὰ δέοντα καὶ αὐτάρκη· ἵνα μὴ πλησθείς, ψευδὴς γένωμαι, καὶ εἴπω· τίς με ὁρᾷ; ἢ πενηθεὶς κλέψω, καὶ ὀμόσω τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ Θεοῦ.
**11** Μὴ παραδῷς οἰκέτην εἰς χεῖρας δεσπότου, μήποτε καταράσηταί σε, καὶ ἀφανισθῇς.
**12** Ἔκγονον κακὸν πατέρα καταρᾶται, τὴν δὲ μητέρα οὐκ εὐλογεῖ.
**13** Ἔκγονον κακὸν δίκαιον ἑαυτὸν κρίνει, τὴν δὲ ἔξοδον αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἀπένιψεν. Ἔκγονον κακὸν ὑψηλοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς ἔχει, τοῖς δὲ βλεφάροις αὐτοῦ ἐπαίρεται.
**14** Ἔκγονον κακὸν μαχαίρας τοὺς ὀδόντας ἔχει, καὶ τὰς μύλας, τομίδας· ὥστε ἀναλίσκειν τοὺς ἀσθενεῖς ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς, καὶ τοὺς πένητας αὐτῶν ἐξ ἀνθρώπων.
**23** Ταῦτα δὲ λέγω ὑμῖν τοῖς σοφοῖς ἐπιγινώσκειν· αἰδεῖσθαι πρόσωπον, οὐ καλὸν ἐν κρίσει.
**24** Ὁ εἰπὼν τὸν ἀσεβῆ, δίκαιός ἐστιν, ἐπικατάρατος λαοῖς ἔσται καὶ μισητὸς εἰς ἔθνη·
**25** οἱ δὲ ἐλέγχοντες βελτίους φανοῦνται, ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς δὲ ἥξει εὐλογία ἀγαθή.
**26** Χείλη δὲ φιλήσουσιν, ἀποκρινόμενα λόγους ἀγαθούς.
**27** Ἑτοίμαζε εἰς τὴν ἔξοδον τὰ ἔργα σου, καὶ παρασκευάζου εἰς τὸν ἀγρόν, καὶ πορεύου κατόπισθέν μου, καὶ ἀνοικοδομήσεις τὸν οἶκόν σου.
**28** Μὴ ἴσθι ψευδὴς μάρτυς ἐπὶ σὸν πολίτην, μηδὲ πλατύνου σοῖς χείλεσι.
**29** Μὴ εἴπῃς· ὃν τρόπον ἐχρήσατό μοι, χρήσομαι αὐτῷ, τίσομαι δὲ αὐτὸν ἃ με ἠδίκησεν.
**30** Ὥσπερ γεώργιον ἀνὴρ ἄφρων, καὶ ὥσπερ ἀμπελὼν ἄνθρωπος ἐνδεὴς φρενῶν·
**31** ἐὰν ἀφῇς αὐτόν, χερσωθήσεται, καὶ χορτομανήσει ὅλος, καὶ γίνεται ἐκλελειμμένος, οἱ δὲ φραγμοί τῶν λίθων αὐτοῦ κατασκάπτονται.
**32** Ὕστερον ἐγὼ μετενόησα· ἐπέβλεψα τοῦ ἐκδέξασθαι παιδείαν.
**33** Ὀλίγον νυστάζω, ὀλίγον δὲ καθυπνῶ, ὀλίγον δὲ ἐναγκαλίζομαι χερσὶ στήθη.
**34** Ἐὰν δὲ τοῦτο ποιῇς, ἥξει προπορευομένη ἡ πενία σου, καὶ ἡ ἔνδειά σου ὥσπερ ἀγαθὸς δρομεύς.
**15** Τῇ βδέλλῃ τρεῖς θυγατέρες ἦσαν ἀγαπήσει ἀγαπώμεναι, καὶ αἱ τρεῖς αὗται οὐκ ἐνεμπίμπλασαν αὐτήν, καὶ ἡ τετάρτη οὐκ ἠρκέσθη εἰπεῖν, ἱκανόν·
**16** ᾅδης, καὶ ἔρως γυναικός, (καὶ τάρταρος) καὶ γῆ οὐκ ἐμπιπλαμένη ὕδατος, καὶ ὕδωρ καὶ πῦρ οὐ μὴ εἴπωσιν, ἀρκεῖ.
**17** Ὀφθαλμὸν καταγελοῦντα πατρός, καὶ ἀτιμάζοντα γῆρας μητρός, ἐκκολάψαισαν αὐτὸν κόρακες ἐκ τῶν φαράγγων, καὶ καταφάγοισαν αὐτὸν νεοσσοὶ ἀετῶν.
**18** Τρία δέ ἐστιν ἀδύνατά μοι νοῆσαι, καὶ τὸ τέταρτον

**7** [unto His] words, lest He reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.
**8** Two things I ask of Thee: deny not my grace from me, before I die. A vain thing do Thou give unto me;
**9** but ordain for me (all) things that are necessary and sufficient, lest, being filled, I become a liar, and say, "Who seeth me?" or, being impoverished, I steal, and swear by the name of God.
**11** Deliver not a servant into the hands of his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be utterly destroyed.
**12** An evil offspring curseth his father, and doth not bless his mother.
**13** An evil offspring judgeth himself righteous, yet hath not washed his going out. An evil offspring hath lofty eyes, and is lifted up with his eyelids.
**14** An evil offspring hath teeth as swords, and his grinders as knives, so that he may consume the weak from the earth, and their poor from among men.
**23** But these things do I say unto you, the wise, to discern: to show partiality is not good in judgment.
**24** He that saith to the wicked, "Thou art righteous," shall be cursed by peoples and hated among nations;
**25** but they that reprove shall appear better, and upon them shall come a good blessing.
**26** And lips shall kiss, that answer good words.
**27** Prepare thy works for the going forth, and make ready for the field, and go thou after me, and thou shalt build up thine house.
**28** Be not a false witness against thy fellow-citizen, neither open thy lips wide.
**29** Say not, "In the manner he used me, so will I use him; and I shall repay him the wrongs he did unto me."
**30** As a cultivated field is a foolish man, and as a vineyard is a man devoid of understanding;
**31** if thou forsake him, he shall become desolate, and shall be wholly overgrown with weeds, and becometh abandoned, and the fences of his stones are dug down.
**32** Afterward did I repent; I looked to receive instruction.
**33** A little I slumber, a little I sleep, a little I embrace my breast with [my] hands.
**34** But if thou doest this, thy poverty shall come forth going before thee, and thy want as a swift runner.
**15** The leech had three daughters, beloved with love, and these three did not fill her, and the fourth was not content to say, "Enough!"
**16** Hades, and the love of a woman, (and Tartarus,) and the earth that is not filled with water, and water and fire shall not say, "It is enough."
**17** The eye that mocketh a father, and despiseth the old age of a mother, let the ravens of the valleys peck it out, and let the young of eagles devour it.
**18** There are three things that are impossible for me to understand, and the fourth
