ὑμῶν ἐκ πάντων τῶν ἐθνῶν δῶρον Κυρίῳ, μεθ᾽ ἵππων καὶ ἁρμάτων ἐν λαμπήναις ἡμιόνων μετὰ σκιαδίων εἰς τὴν ἁγίαν πόλιν
Ἱερουσαλήμ, εἶπε Κύριος, ὡς ἀνενέγκαισαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐμοὶ
21 τὰς θυσίας αὐτῶν μετὰ ψαλμῶν εἰς τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου, καὶ ἀπ᾽
22 αὐτῶν λήψομαι ἐμαυτῷ ἱερεῖς καὶ λευΐτας, εἶπε Κύριος. Ὃν
τρόπον γὰρ ὁ οὐρανὸς καινὸς καὶ ἡ γῆ καινή, ἃ ἐγὼ ποιῶ, μένει
ἐνώπιον μου, λέγει Κύριος, οὕτως στήσεται τὸ σπέρμα ὑμῶν
23 καὶ τὸ ὄνομα ὑμῶν. Καὶ ἔσται μῆνα ἐκ μηνός, καὶ σάββατον
ἐκ σαββάτου, ἥξει πᾶσα σὰρξ ἐνώπιον μου προσκυνῆσαι ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, εἶπε Κύριος.
24 Καὶ ἐξελεύσονται, καὶ ὄψονται τὰ κῶλα τῶν ἀνθρώπων τῶν παραβεβηκότων ἐν ἐμοί· ὁ γὰρ σκώληξ αὐτῶν
οὐ τελευτήσει, καὶ τὸ πῦρ αὐτῶν οὐ σβεσθήσεται, καὶ ἔσονται
εἰς ὅρασιν πάσῃ σαρκί.

#### Isaiah Chapter 66

**20** ...[your brethren] from all the nations as an offering unto the Lord,
    with horses and chariots, upon litters [and] mules, with canopies,
    unto the holy city Jerusalem, saith the Lord,
    as the sons of Israel did offer unto Me
**21** their sacrifices with psalms into the house of the Lord.
**22** And from among them will I take unto Myself priests and Levites, saith the Lord.
    For in like manner as the new heaven and the new earth,
    which I make, shall remain before Me, saith the Lord,
    so shall your seed and your name abide.
**23** And it shall come to pass, that from month to month,
    and from sabbath to sabbath,
    all flesh shall come before Me to worship in Jerusalem, saith the Lord.
**24** And they shall go forth, and they shall behold the corpses of the men
    who have transgressed against Me;
    for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched;
    and they shall be an abhorrence unto all flesh.
