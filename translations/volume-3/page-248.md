ΚΕΦ. ΜΕ΄. ΜΣ΄.

22 σωτὴρ, οὐκ ἔστιν (ἄλλος) πάρεξ ἐμοῦ. Ἐπιστράφητε πρὸς με, καὶ σωθήσεσθε, οἱ ἀπ’ ἐσχάτου τῆς γῆς· ἐγὼ εἰμι ὁ Θεὸς, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἄλλος (πλὴν ἐμοῦ· δίκαιος καὶ σωτὴρ οὐκ ἔστι πάρεξ ἐμοῦ.)
23 Κατ’ ἐμαυτοῦ ὀμνύω, εἰ μὴ ἐξελεύσεται ἐκ τοῦ στόματός μου δικαιοσύνη, οἱ λόγοι μου οὐκ ἀποστραφήσονται· ὅτι ἐμοὶ κάμψει πᾶν γόνυ, καὶ ἐξομολογήσεται πᾶσα γλῶσσα τῷ Θεῷ,
24 λέγων· δικαιοσύνη καὶ δόξα πρὸς αὐτὸν ἥξει· καὶ αἰσχυνθήσονται πάντες οἱ ἀφορίζοντες αὐτοὺς,
25 ἀπὸ Κυρίου δικαιωθήσονται, καὶ ἐν τῷ Θεῷ ἐνδοξασθήσονται (καὶ) πᾶν τὸ σπέρμα τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ.

#### Chapter 46

1 ΕΠΕΣΕ Βὴλ, συνετερίβη Ναβὼ, ἐγένετο τὰ γλυπτὰ αὐτῶν εἰς θηρία, καὶ κτήνη· αἴρετε αὐτὰ καταδεδεμένα ὡς φορτίον
2 κοπιῶντι, καὶ πεινῶντι, καὶ ἐκλελυμένῳ, οὐκ ἰσχύοντι ἅμα, οἳ οὐ μὴ δύνωνται σωθῆναι ἀπὸ πολέμου, αὐτοὶ δὲ αἰχμάλωτοι ἤχθησαν.
3 Ἀκούσατέ μου, οἶκος τοῦ Ἰακὼβ, καὶ πᾶν τὸ κατάλοιπον τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ, οἱ αἰρόμενοι ἐκ κοιλίας, καὶ παιδευόμενοι ἀπὸ παιδίου ἕως γήρους·
4 ἐγώ εἰμι, καὶ ἕως ἂν καταγηράσητε, ἐγώ εἰμι, ἐγὼ ἀνέχομαι ὑμῶν, ἐγὼ ἐποίησα, καὶ ἐγὼ ἀνήσω, καὶ ἐγὼ ἀναλήψομαι, καὶ σώσω ὑμᾶς.
5 Τίνι με ὡμοιώσατε; ἴδετε, τεχνάσασθε οἱ πλανώμενοι, οἱ συμβαλλόμενοι χρυσίον ἐκ μαρσιππίου, καὶ ἀργύριον ἐν ζυγῷ, στήσουσιν ἐν σταθμῷ,
6 καὶ μισθωσάμενοι χρυσοχόον ἐποίησαν χειροποίητα, καὶ κύψαντες προσκυνοῦσιν αὐτοῖς.
7 Αἴρουσιν αὐτὸ ἐπὶ τοῦ ὤμου, καὶ πορεύονται· ἐὰν δὲ θῶσιν αὐτὸ ἐπὶ τοῦ τόπου αὐτοῦ, μένει, οὐ μὴ κινηθῇ· καὶ ὃς ἂν βοήσῃ πρὸς αὐτὸν, οὐ μὴ ἀκούσῃ, ἀπὸ κακῶν οὐ μὴ σώσῃ αὐτόν.
8 Μνήσθητε ταῦτα, καὶ στενάξατε, μετανοήσατε οἱ πεπλανημένοι, ἐπιστρέψατε τῇ καρδίᾳ, καὶ μνήσθητε τὰ
9 πρότερα ἀπὸ τοῦ αἰῶνος. ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ Θεὸς, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἔτι πλὴν ἐμοῦ, ἀναγγέλλων πρότερον τὰ ἔσχατα πρὶν αὐτὰ γενέσθαι,
10 καὶ ἅμα συνετελέσθη· καὶ εἶπα, πᾶσά μου ἡ βουλὴ στήσεται, καὶ πάντα ὅσα βεβούλευμαι, ποιήσω.
11 Καλῶν ἀπ’ ἀνατολῶν πετεινὸν, καὶ ἀπὸ γῆς πόῤῥωθεν περὶ ὧν βεβούλευμαι, ἐλάλησα, καὶ ἤγαγον· ἔκτισα καὶ ἐποίησα, ἤγαγον αὐτὸν, καὶ εὐώδωσα τὴν ὁδὸν αὐτοῦ.
12 Ἀκούσατέ μου οἱ ἀπολωλεκότες τὴν καρδίαν,

#### Chapter 45

**22** Savior; there is none other [God] save Me.
    Turn ye unto Me, and ye shall be saved,
    ye from the uttermost part of the earth:
    for I am God, and there is none other
    (save Me; righteous and Savior,
    there is none other save Me.)
**23** By Myself have I sworn,
    if righteousness shall not issue forth from My mouth,
    My words shall not turn back:
    for unto Me every knee shall bow,
    and every tongue shall confess to God,
**24** saying, 'Righteousness and glory shall come unto Him.'
    And all they that separate themselves from them
    shall be put to shame;
**25** by the Lord shall they be justified,
    and in God shall [also] all the seed of the sons of Israel be glorified.

#### Chapter 46

**1** Bel hath fallen, Nebo is broken in pieces;
    their graven images are become [a burden] unto beasts and to cattle.
    Bear ye them, bound as a burden
**2** unto one that is weary, and that hungereth,
    and that is exhausted, having no strength together,
    which cannot save themselves from war,
    but they themselves are led away captive.
**3** Hearken unto Me, O house of Jacob,
    and all the remnant of Israel,
    ye who are borne from the womb,
    and who are nurtured from childhood even unto old age:
**4** I am He, and even until ye wax old, I am He;
    I bear you up, I have made,
    and I will carry [you], and I will take [you] up,
    and I will save you.
**5** To whom have ye likened Me?
    Behold, devise [your plans], ye that wander,
    ye that weigh out gold from a purse,
    and silver in a balance, [and] set it in the scales,
**6** and having hired a goldsmith, they make handmade [idols],
    and bowing down, they worship them.
**7** They lift it upon their shoulder, and they go forth;
    but if they set it down upon its place,
    there it remaineth, it shall not be moved;
    and whosoever shall cry unto it, it shall not hear,
    nor shall it save him from evils.
**8** Remember these things, and sigh deeply,
    repent ye that have erred,
    return ye in heart, and remember the
**9** former things from everlasting;
    for I am God, and there is none other beside Me,
    declaring beforehand the latter things before they come to pass,
**10** and at once it was accomplished;
    and I said, 'All My counsel shall stand,
    and whatsoever I have purposed, that will I do.'
**11** Calling a flying creature from the East,
    and from a far country, concerning those things
    which I have purposed;
    I have spoken, and I have brought [it to pass];
    I have created and I have made,
    I have brought him, and I have prospered his way.
**12** Hearken unto Me, ye that have lost heart,
