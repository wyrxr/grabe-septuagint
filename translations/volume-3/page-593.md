ἐκ τῆς ὁδοῦ, καὶ πολλοὺς ἠσθενήσατε ἐν νόμῳ, καὶ διεφθείρατε
9 τὴν διαθήκην τοῦ Λευί, λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ. Καὶ ἐγὼ
δέδωκα ὑμᾶς ἐξουδενωμένους, καὶ ἀπεῤῥιμμένους εἰς πάντα τὰ
ἔθνη· ἀνθ᾿ ὧν ὑμεῖς οὐκ ἐφυλάξασθε τοὺς ὁδούς μου, ἀλλ᾿ ἐλαμβά-
10 νετε πρόσωπα ἐν νόμῳ. Οὐχὶ Θεὸς εἷς ἔκτισεν ἡμᾶς; οὐχὶ πα-
τὴρ εἷς πάντων ἡμῶν; τί ὅτι ἐγκατελίπετε ἕκαστος τὸν ἀδελ-
φὸν αὐτοῦ, τοῦ βεβηλῶσαι τὴν διαθήκην τῶν πατέρων ὑμῶν;
11 Ἐγκατελείφθη Ἰούδας, καὶ βδέλυγμα ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ Ἰσραὴλ καὶ
ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ· διότι ἐβεβήλωσεν Ἰούδας τὰ ἅγια Κυρίου, ἐν οἷς
ἠγάπησε, καὶ ἐπετήδευσεν εἰς Θεοὺς ἀλλοτρίους. Ἐξολεθρεύσει
12 Κύριος τὸν ἄνθρωπον τὸν ποιοῦντα ταῦτα, ἕως καὶ ταπεινωθῇ ἐκ
σκηνωμάτων Ἰακώβ, καὶ ἐκ προσαγαγόντων θυσίαν τῷ Κυρίῳ
παντοκράτορι. 13 Καὶ ταῦτα, ἃ ἐμίσουν, ἐποιεῖτε· ἐκαλύπτετε δά-
κρυσι τὸ θυσιαστήριον Κυρίου, καὶ κλαυθμῷ καὶ στεναγμῷ ἐκ κό-
πων· εἰ ἔτι ἄξιον ἐπιβλέψαι εἰς θυσίαν, ἢ λαβεῖν δεκτὸν ἐκ τῶν
14 χειρῶν ὑμῶν; Καὶ εἴπατε, ἕνεκα τίνος; ὅτι Κύριος διεμαρτύρατο
ἀναμέσον σου καὶ ἀναμέσον γυναικὸς νεότητός σου, ἣν ἐγκατέλι-
πες, καὶ αὕτη κοινωνός σου, καὶ γυνὴ διαθήκης σου. 15 Καὶ οὐκ ἄλ-
λος ἐποίησε; καὶ ὑπόλειμμα πνεύματος αὐτῷ. Καὶ εἴπατε· τί
ἄλλο ἢ σπέρμα ζητεῖ ὁ Θεός; Καὶ φυλάξασθε ἐν τῷ πνεύματι
ὑμῶν, καὶ γυναῖκα νεότητός σου μὴ ἐγκαταλίπῃς· 16 ἀλλ᾿ ἐὰν μισή-
σας ἐξαποστείλῃς, λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὁ παντοκράτωρ Θεὸς Ἰ-
σραήλ, καὶ καλύψει ἀσέβεια ἐπὶ τὰ ἐνδύματά σου, λέγει Κύριος
παντοκράτωρ· καὶ φυλάξασθε ἐν τῷ πνεύματι ὑμῶν, καὶ οὐ μὴ
ἐγκαταλίπητε. 17 Οἱ παροξύνοντες τὸν Θεὸν ἐν τοῖς λόγοις ὑμῶν.
Καὶ εἴπατε· ἐν τίνι παροξύναμεν ; ἐν τῷ λέγειν ὑμᾶς· πᾶς ποιῶν
πονηρόν, καλὸν ἐνώπιον Κυρίου, καὶ ἐν αὐτοῖς αὐτὸς εὐδόκησε·
καὶ ποῦ ἐστιν ὁ Θεὸς τῆς δικαιοσύνης;

1 ἸΔΟΥ ἐγὼ ἐξαποστέλλω τὸν ἄγγελόν μου, καὶ ἐπιβλέψεται
ὁδὸν πρὸ προσώπου μου, καὶ ἐξαίφνης ἥξει εἰς τὸν ναὸν αὐτοῦ
Κύριος, ὃν ὑμεῖς ζητεῖτε, καὶ ὁ ἄγγελος τῆς διαθήκης, ὃν ὑμεῖς
θέλετε· ἰδοὺ ἔρχεται, λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ. 2 Καὶ τίς ὑπο-
μενεῖ ἡμέραν εἰσόδου αὐτοῦ; καὶ τίς ὑποστήσεται ἐν τῇ ὀπτα-

**Malachi [Chapter] 2**

**8** ...from the way; and many have ye caused to stumble in the Law, and ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the LORD Almighty.
**9** Therefore have I also made you despised and cast out among all the nations; because ye have not kept My ways, but have been partial in the Law.
**10** Hath not one God created us? Hath not one Father [created] all of us? Why then do ye deal treacherously every man against his brother, to profane the covenant of your fathers?
**11** Judah hath committed apostasy, and an abomination hath come to pass in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the holy things of the LORD which He loveth, and hath pursued after foreign gods.
**12** The LORD shall cut off the man that doeth these things, [yea, even until] he be utterly disgraced and removed from the dwellings of Jacob, and from those who offer a sacrifice unto the LORD Almighty.
**13** And this ye do again, [even] that which I hate: ye cover the altar of the LORD with tears, with weeping and with groaning from your weariness. Shall I yet regard the offering, or receive [aught] acceptable from your hands?
**14** Yet ye say, “For what cause?” Because the LORD hath borne witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, whom thou hast forsaken; yet she is thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant.
**15** And did not He [make you] one, having a remnant of the spirit [within Him, yet chose to make but one pair]? And ye say, “What doth God seek but a godly offspring?” Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let no man forsake the wife of his youth.
**16** For if thou hatest and puttest [her] away, saith the LORD God Almighty, the God of Israel, then impiety shall cover thy garments, saith the LORD Almighty. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and forsake [her] not!
**17** Ye have provoked God with your words. Yet ye say, “Wherein have we provoked [Him]?” In that ye say, “Every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of the LORD, and in them He delighteth”; and, “Where is the God of righteousness?”

**Malachi [Chapter] 3**

**1** Behold, I send My messenger, and he shall prepare a way before My face; and suddenly shall the Lord come to His temple, whom ye seek, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye desire. Behold, He cometh, saith the LORD Almighty.
**2** But who may abide the day of His coming? And who shall stand when He appeareth?
