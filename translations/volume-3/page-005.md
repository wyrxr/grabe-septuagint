ΨΑΛΜ. Ηʹ. VIII.

Εἰς τὸ τέλος ὑπὲρ τῶν ληνῶν, Ψαλμὸς τῷ Δαυίδ.
Κύριε ὁ κύριος ἡμῶν, ὡς θαυμαστὸν τὸ ὄνομά σου ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ· ὅτι
ἐπήρθη ἡ μεγαλοπρέπειά σου ὑπεράνω τῶν οὐρανῶν.
Ἐκ στόματος νηπίων καὶ θηλαζόντων κατηρτίσω αἶνον ἕνεκα τῶν ἐχθρῶν
σου, τοῦ καταλῦσαι ἐχθρὸν καὶ ἐκδικητήν.
Ὅτι ὄψομαι τοὺς οὐρανούς σου, ἔργα τῶν δακτύλων σου, σελήνην καὶ ἀστέρας ἃ σὺ ἐθεμελίωσας·
τίς ἐστιν ἄνθρωπος, ὅτι μιμνήσκῃ αὐτοῦ, ἢ υἱὸς ἀνθρώπου, ὅτι ἐπισκέπτῃ αὐτόν;
Ἠλάττωσας αὐτὸν βραχύ τι παρ᾿ ἀγγέλους· δόξῃ καὶ τιμῇ ἐστεφάνωσας αὐτόν,
καὶ κατέστησας αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὰ ἔργα τῶν χειρῶν σου· πάντα ὑπέταξας ὑποκάτω τῶν
ποδῶν αὐτοῦ, πρόβατα καὶ βόας ἀπάσας, ἔτι δὲ καὶ τὰ κτήνη τοῦ
πεδίου, τὰ πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ τοὺς ἰχθύας τῆς θαλάσσης,
τὰ διαπορευόμενα τρίβους θαλασσῶν.
Κύριε ὁ κύριος ἡμῶν, ὡς θαυμαστὸν τὸ ὄνομά σου ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ.

ΨΑΛΜ. Θʹ. IX.

Εἰς τὸ τέλος ὑπὲρ τῶν κρυφίων τοῦ υἱοῦ, Ψαλμὸς τῷ Δαυίδ.
Ἐξομολογήσομαί σοι Κύριε ἐν ὅλῃ καρδίᾳ μου, διηγήσομαι πάντα
τὰ θαυμάσιά σου·
εὐφρανθήσομαι καὶ ἀγαλλιάσομαι ἐν σοί, ψαλῶ τῷ ὀνόματί σου ὕψιστε,
ἐν τῷ ἀποστραφῆναι τὸν ἐχθρόν μου εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω· ἀσθενήσουσι καὶ ἀπολοῦνται ἀπὸ προσώπου σου.
Ὅτι ἐποίησας τὴν κρίσιν μου καὶ τὴν δίκην μου· ἐκάθισας ἐπὶ θρόνου
ὁ κρίνων δικαιοσύνην.
Ἐπετίμησας ἔθνεσι, καὶ ἀπώλετο ὁ ἀσεβής· τὸ ὄνομα αὐτῶν ἐξήλειψας εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα καὶ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τοῦ
αἰῶνος.
Τοῦ ἐχθροῦ ἐξέλειπον αἱ ῥομφαῖαι εἰς τέλος, καὶ πόλεις καθεῖλες· ἀπώλετο τὸ μνημόσυνον αὐτῶν μετ᾿ ἤχους.
Καὶ ὁ Κύριος εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα μενεῖ· ἡτοίμασεν ἐν κρίσει τὸν θρόνον αὐτοῦ·
καὶ αὐτὸς κρινεῖ τὴν οἰκουμένην ἐν δικαιοσύνῃ, κρινεῖ λαοὺς ἐν εὐθύτητι.
Καὶ ἐγένετο Κύριος καταφυγὴ τῷ πένητι, βοηθὸς ἐν εὐκαιρίαις ἐν θλίψει.
Καὶ ἐλπισάτωσαν ἐπὶ σοὶ (πάντες) οἱ γινώσκοντες τὸ ὄνομά σου· ὅτι οὐκ ἐγκατέλιπες τοὺς ἐκζητοῦντάς σε, Κύριε.
Ψάλατε τῷ Κυρίῳ τῷ κατοικοῦντι ἐν Σιών, ἀναγγείλατε ἐν

**PSALM VIII.**

*For the End, concerning the winepresses; A Psalm of David.*

1.  O Lord our Lord,
    How wonderful is Thy Name in all the earth!
    For Thy majesty is lifted up above the heavens.
2.  From the mouth of babes and sucklings
    Hast Thou perfected praise, because of Thine enemies,
    To utterly destroy the foe and the avenger.
3.  For I shall behold Thy heavens, the works of Thy fingers,
    The moon and the stars which Thou hast established.
4.  What is man, that Thou art mindful of him?
    Or the Son of man, that Thou dost visit him?
5.  Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels;
    With glory and honor hast Thou crowned him,
6.  And hast set him over the works of Thy hands;
    All things hast Thou put under his feet:
7.  All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;
8.  The fowls of the air, and the fish of the sea,
    Which pass through the paths of the seas.
9.  O Lord our Lord,
    How wonderful is Thy Name in all the earth!

**PSALM IX.**

*For the End, concerning the secret things of the Son; A Psalm of David.*

1.  I will give thanks unto Thee, O Lord, with my whole heart;
    I will recount all Thy wondrous deeds.
2.  I will be glad and rejoice in Thee;
    I will sing praises to Thy Name, O Most High,
3.  When my enemy is turned back.
    They shall grow weak and perish from before Thy face.
4.  For Thou hast wrought my judgment and my cause;
    Thou hast sat upon the throne, O Thou that judgest righteousness.
5.  Thou hast rebuked the nations, and the ungodly hath perished;
    Their name hast Thou blotted out for ever and ever.
6.  The swords of the enemy are utterly consumed,
    And cities hast Thou cast down;
    Their memorial hath perished with a sound.
7.  But the Lord shall abide for ever;
    He hath prepared His throne for judgment.
8.  And He Himself shall judge the world in righteousness;
    He shall judge the peoples with uprightness.
9.  And the Lord is become a refuge for the poor,
    A helper in due season, in tribulation.
10. And let [all] them that know Thy Name hope in Thee;
    For Thou hast not forsaken them that seek Thee, O Lord.
11. Sing praises unto the Lord, who dwelleth in Sion;
    Declare among the nations
