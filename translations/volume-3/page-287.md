ΚΕΦ. Ζʹ. ΙΕΡΕΜΙΑΣ 1225

**5** ὁδοὺς ὑμῶν, καὶ τὰ ἐπιτηδεύματα ὑμῶν, καὶ ποιοῦντες ποιήσητε κρίμα ἀναμέσον ἀνδρὸς, καὶ ἀναμέσον τοῦ πλησίον αὐτοῦ,
**6** καὶ προσήλυτον καὶ ὀρφανὸν καὶ χήραν μὴ καταδυναστεύσητε, καὶ αἷμα ἀθῷον μὴ ἐκχέητε ἐν τῷ τόπῳ τούτῳ, καὶ ὀπίσω θεῶν ἀλλοτρίων μὴ πορεύσησθε εἰς κακὸν ὑμῖν,
**7** καὶ κατοικιῶ ὑμᾶς ἐν τῷ τόπῳ τούτῳ, ἐν γῇ ᾗ ἔδωκα τοῖς πατράσιν ὑμῶν ἐξ αἰῶνος καὶ ἕως αἰῶνος.
**8** Εἰ δὲ ὑμεῖς πεποίθατε ἐπὶ λόγοις ψευδέσι, ὅθεν οὐκ ὠφεληθήσεσθε,
**9** καὶ φονεύετε, καὶ μοιχᾶσθε, καὶ κλέπτετε, καὶ ὀμνύετε ἐπ᾽ ἀδίκῳ, καὶ θυμιᾶτε τῇ Βάαλ καὶ ὀπίσω θεῶν ἀλλοτρίων πορεύεσθε, ὧν οὐκ οἴδατε, τοῦ κακῶς εἶναι ὑμῖν,
**10** καὶ ἤλθατε, καὶ ἔστητε ἐνώπιόν μου ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ, οὗ ἐπικέκληται τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐπ᾽ αὐτῷ, καὶ εἴπατε, ἀπεσχήμεθα τοῦ μὴ ποιεῖν πάντα τὰ βδελύγματα ταῦτα.
**11** Μὴ σπήλαιον λῃστῶν ὁ οἶκός μου, οὗ ἐπικέκληται τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐπ᾽ αὐτῷ ἐκεῖ ἐνώπιον ὑμῶν; καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἑώρακα, λέγει Κύριος,
**12** ὅτι πορεύεσθε εἰς τὸν τόπον μου τὸν ἐν Σηλὼ, οὗ κατεσκήνωσα τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐκεῖ ἔμπροσθεν, καὶ ἴδετε ἃ ἐποίησα αὐτῷ ἀπὸ προσώπου κακίας λαοῦ μου Ἰσραήλ.
**13** Καὶ νῦν ἀνθ᾽ ὧν ἐποιήσατε πάντα τὰ ἔργα ταῦτα, φησὶ Κύριος, καὶ ἐλάλησα πρὸς ὑμᾶς ὀρθρίζων καὶ λαλῶν, καὶ οὐκ ἠκούσατέ μου, καὶ ἐκάλεσα ὑμᾶς καὶ οὐκ ἀπεκρίθητε,
**14** τοίνυν κἀγὼ ποιήσω τῷ οἴκῳ ᾧ ἐπικέκληται τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐπ᾽ αὐτῷ, ἐφ᾽ ᾧ ὑμεῖς πεποίθατε ἐπ᾽ αὐτῷ, καὶ τῷ τόπῳ ᾧ ἔδωκα ὑμῖν καὶ τοῖς πατράσιν ὑμῶν, καθὼς ἐποίησα τῇ Σηλὼ.
**15** Καὶ ἀποῤῥίψω ὑμᾶς ἀπὸ προσώπου μου, καθὼς ἀπέρριψα τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς ὑμῶν, πᾶν τὸ σπέρμα Ἐφραίμ.
**16** Καὶ σὺ μὴ προσεύχου ὑπὲρ τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου, καὶ μὴ ἀξιοῦ τοῦ ἐλεηθῆναι αὐτοὺς, καὶ μὴ εὔχου, καὶ μὴ προσέλθῃς μοι περὶ αὐτῶν, ὅτι οὐκ εἰσακούσομαι.
**17** Ἢ οὐχ ὁρᾷς, τί αὐτοὶ ποιοῦσιν ἐν ταῖς πόλεσιν Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς Ἱερουσαλήμ;
**18** Οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτῶν συλλέγουσι ξύλα, καὶ οἱ πατέρες αὐτῶν καίουσι πῦρ, καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες αὐτῶν τρίβουσι σῖτα, τοῦ ποιῆσαι καυῶνας τῇ στρατιᾷ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ σπεῖσαι σπονδὰς θεοῖς ἀλλοτρίοις, ἵνα παροργίσωσί με.
**19** Μὴ ἐμὲ αὐτοὶ παροργίζουσι, λέγει Κύριος, οὐχ ἑαυτούς; ὅπως καταισχυνθῇ τὰ πρόσωπα αὐτῶν;
**20** Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Κύριος· ἰδοὺ ὀργὴ καὶ θυμός μου ἐκχείται ἐπὶ τὸν τόπον τοῦτον, καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀνθρώπους, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ κτήνη, καὶ ἐπὶ πᾶν ξύλον τοῦ ἀγροῦ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπὶ πάντα τὰ γεννήματα τῆς γῆς, καὶ καυθήσεται καὶ οὐ

**JEREMIAH CHAPTER 7**

**5** [but] amend your ways and your deeds, and ye shall surely do justice betwixt a man and betwixt his neighbor;
**6** and the sojourner and the orphan and the widow shall ye not oppress, neither shall ye shed innocent blood in this place; nor shall ye walk after foreign gods to your own harm.
**7** And I will cause you to dwell in this place, in the land which I gave unto your fathers from everlasting and unto everlasting.
**8** But if ye trust in false words, from which ye shall not be profited,
**9** and murder, and commit adultery, and steal, and swear falsely, and burn incense to Baal, and go after foreign gods whom ye know not, to your own detriment;
**10** and then ye come and stand before Me in the house over which My Name is called upon it, and say, "We have refrained from not doing all these abominations!"
**11** Hath My house become a den of robbers, over which My Name is called upon it, there before your very eyes? Yea, behold, I have seen it, saith the Lord.
**12** For ye go unto My place which is in Shiloh, where I caused My Name to dwell there in days of old; and see what I did unto it because of the wickedness of My people Israel.
**13** And now, because of all these works which ye have wrought, saith the Lord, and though I spake unto you, rising early and speaking, yet ye hearkened not unto Me; and I called you, yet ye answered not.
**14** Therefore I also will do unto the house over which My Name is called upon it, wherein ye have put your trust upon it, and unto the place which I gave unto you and to your fathers, just as I did unto Shiloh.
**15** And I will cast you forth from My presence, even as I cast forth your brethren, all the seed of Ephraim.
**16** And thou, pray not for this people, neither implore for them to be shown mercy; and do not pray, nor draw nigh unto Me concerning them, for I will not hear [thee].
**17** Or seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?
**18** Their sons gather wood, and their fathers kindle fire, and their women knead grain, to make cakes for the host of heaven; and they pour out libations to foreign gods, so that they may provoke Me to wrath.
**19** Is it I whom they provoke to wrath, saith the Lord, [and] not themselves? [Is it] that their faces may be put to shame?
**20** Therefore thus saith the Lord: Behold, My wrath and My fury are poured out upon this place, and upon men, and upon beasts, and upon every tree of their field, and upon all the fruits of the earth; and it shall burn and shall not
