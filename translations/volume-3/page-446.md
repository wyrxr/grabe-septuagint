χαίραις γιγάντων, καὶ καταβαλῶ τὴν ἰσχύν σου, λοιμοὶ ἀπὸ 12
ἐθνῶν πάντες, καὶ ἀπολοῦσι τὴν ὕβριν Αἰγύπτου, καὶ συντριβή-
σεται πᾶσα ἡ ἰσχὺς αὐτῆς. Καὶ ἀπολῶ πάντα τὰ κτήνη αὐτῆς 13
ἀφ᾿ ὕδατος πολλοῦ, καὶ οὐ μὴ ταράξῃ αὐτὸ ἔτι πούς ἀνθρώπου,
καὶ ἴχνος κτήνους οὐ μὴ καταπατήσῃ αὐτό. Οὕτως τότε ἡσυ- 14
χάσει τὰ ὕδατα αὐτῶν, καὶ οἱ ποταμοὶ αὐτῶν ὡς ἔλαιον πορεύ-
σονται, λέγει Ἀδωναῖ Κύριος. Ὅταν δῶ Αἴγυπτον εἰς ἀπώλειαν, 15
καὶ ἐρημωθῇ ἡ γῆ σὺν τῇ πληρώσει αὐτῆς, ὅταν διασπείρω πάν-
τας τοὺς κατοικοῦντας ἐν αὐτῇ, καὶ γνώσονται ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι Κύ-
ριος, θρῆνός ἐστι καὶ θρηνήσουσιν αὐτόν, καὶ αἱ θυγατέρες τῶν
ἐθνῶν θρηνήσουσιν αὐτὸν ἐπ᾿ Αἴγυπτον, καὶ ἐπὶ πᾶσαν τὴν ἰ-
σχὺν αὐτῆς θρηνήσουσιν αὐτήν, λέγει Κύριος Κύριος. Καὶ ἐγένετο 16
ἐν τῷ δωδεκάτῳ ἔτει ἐν τῷ πρώτῳ μηνὶ, πεντεκαιδεκάτῃ τοῦ μη-
νός, ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς μέ, λέγων· υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, θρήνησον 17
ἐπὶ τὴν ἰσχὺν Αἰγύπτου, καὶ καταβιβάσουσιν αὐτῆς τὰς θυγατέ-
ρας τὰ ἔθνη νεκρὰς εἰς τὸ βάθος τῆς γῆς, πρὸς τοὺς καταβαί-
νοντας εἰς βόθρον, ἐξ ὑδάτων εὐπρεποῦς κατάβηθι, καὶ κοιμή-
θητι μετὰ ἀπεριτμήτων, ἐν μέσῳ τραυματιῶν μαχαίρᾳ πεσοῦν-
ται μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ κοιμηθήσεται πᾶσα ἡ ἰσχὺς αὐτοῦ. Καὶ 18
ἐροῦσί σοι οἱ γίγαντες, ἐν βάθει βόθρου γίνου, τίνος κρείττων εἶ;
κατάβηθι, καὶ κοιμήθητι μετὰ ἀπεριτμήτων ἐν μέσῳ τραυματιῶν μα-
χαίρας. Ἐκεῖ Ἀσσοῦρ καὶ πᾶσα ἡ συναγωγὴ αὐτοῦ, πάντες τραυ- 19
ματίαι ἐκεῖ ἐδόθησαν· ἡ ταφὴ αὐτῶν ἐν βάθει βόθρου, καὶ ἐγε-
νήθη ἡ συναγωγὴ αὐτοῦ· περικύκλῳ τοῦ μνήματος αὐτοῦ πάντες
τραυματίαι οἱ πεπτωκότες μαχαίρᾳ, οἳ ἔδωκαν τὰς ταρὰς αὐ-
τῆς ἐν μπροῖς λάκκου, καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐκκλησία αὐτοῦ· περικύκλῳ
τῆς ταφῆς αὐτοῦ, πάντες αὐτοὶ τραυματίαι, πίπτοντες μαχαίρᾳ,
οἱ δόντες τὸν φόβον αὐτῶν ἐπὶ γῆς ζωῆς. Ἐκεῖ Αἰλὰμ καὶ πᾶσα 20
ἡ δύναμις αὐτοῦ περικύκλῳ τοῦ μνήματος αὐτοῦ· πάντες οἱ τραυ-
ματίαι οἱ πεπτωκότες μαχαίρᾳ, καὶ οἱ καταβαίνοντες ἀπερίτμητοι
εἰς γῆν βάθους, οἱ δεδωκότες τὸν φόβον αὐτῶν ἐπὶ γῆς ζωῆς, καὶ
ἐλάβοσαν τὴν βάσανον αὐτῶν μετὰ τῶν καταβαινόντων εἰς βό- 21
θρον, ἐν μέσῳ τραυματιῶν ἐδόθη κοίτη αὐτῆς σὺν παντὶ τῷ πλή-
θει ἑκάστου περικύκλῳ ἡ ταφὴ αὐτοῦ· πάντες ἀπερίτμητοι τραυ-
ματιῶν μαχαίρᾳ. Ἐκεῖ ἐδόθησαν Μοσόχ, καὶ Θοβέλ, καὶ πᾶσα 22
ἡ ἰσχὺς αὐτοῦ, περικύκλῳ τοῦ μνήματος αὐτοῦ πάντες τραυμα-

**Chapter 32**

**12** ...with the joys of giants, and I will cast down thy might; all plagues from the nations, and they shall destroy the arrogance of Egypt, and all her might shall be shattered.
**13** And I will destroy all her cattle from much water, and no foot of man shall trouble it any more, nor the track of any beast shall trample it.
**14** Thus then shall their waters be still, and their rivers shall flow as oil, saith Adonai the Lord.
**15** When I shall give Egypt unto destruction, and the land shall be made desolate with its fullness, when I shall scatter all those that dwell therein, then shall they know that I am the Lord. It is a lamentation, and they shall lament it; yea, the daughters of the nations shall lament it for Egypt, and for all her might shall they lament her, saith the Lord, the Lord.

**16** And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the first month, on the fifteenth [day] of the month, that the word of the Lord came unto me, saying:
**17** "Son of man, take up a lamentation for the might of Egypt; and the nations shall bring down her daughters, dead, into the depth of the earth, unto those that go down into the pit, from pleasant waters. Go down, and lie down among the uncircumcised; in the midst of those slain by the sword shall they fall with him, and all his might shall lie down.
**18** And the giants shall say unto thee, in the depth of the pit, 'Of whom art thou mightier?' Get thee down, and lie down with the uncircumcised, in the midst of those slain by the sword."

**19** There is Asshur and all his assembly; all the wounded were given there. Their burial is in the depth of the pit, and his assembly came to be. Round about his sepulchre are all the wounded, those fallen by the sword, who gave her troubles in the `mprois` of the pit; and his congregation came to be. Round about his burial, all they are wounded, falling by the sword, who gave their fear upon the land of the living.
**20** There is Elam and all his power round about his tomb; all the wounded, those fallen by the sword, and those that go down uncircumcised into the land of depth, who gave their fear upon the land of the living; and they received their torment with those that go down into the pit.
**21** In the midst of the wounded was her resting place given, with all the multitude of each one. Round about his burial, all uncircumcised, among those wounded by the sword.
**22** There were given Mosoch and Thobel, and all his might; round about his tomb are all the wounded...
