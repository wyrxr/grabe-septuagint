**ΨΑΛΜ. ΛΘʹ.**
σοί πάντες οἱ ζητοῦντές σε, (Κύριε) · καὶ εἰπάτωσαν διαπαντὸς,
μεγαλυνθήτω ὁ Κύριος, οἱ ἀγαπῶντες τὸ σωτήριόν σου. Ἐγὼ δὲ
πτωχὸς εἰμί καὶ πένης, ὁ Κύριος φροντιεῖ μου · βοηθός μου καὶ
ὑπερασπιστής μου εἶ σύ, ὁ Θεός μου μὴ χρονίσῃς.

**ΨΑΛΜ. Μʹ. XL.**

Εἰς τὸ τέλος, Ψαλμὸς τῷ Δαυίδ.
Μακάριος ὁ συνιῶν ἐπὶ πτωχὸν καὶ πένητα, ἐν ἡμέρᾳ πονηρᾷ ῥύσεται αὐτὸν ὁ Κύριος ·
Κύριος διαφυλάξαι αὐτὸν, καὶ ζῆσαι αὐτὸν, καὶ μακαρίσαι αὐτὸν
ἐν τῇ γῇ, καὶ μὴ παραδῴῃ αὐτὸν εἰς χεῖρας ἐχθρῶν αὐτοῦ · Κύριος βοηθήσει αὐτῷ ἐπὶ κλίνης ὀδύνης αὐτοῦ · ὅλην τὴν κοίτην αὐτοῦ ἔστρεψας ἐν τῇ ἀρρωστίᾳ αὐτοῦ. Ἐγὼ εἶπα · Κύριε ἐλέησόν
με, ἴασαι τὴν ψυχήν μου, ὅτι ἡμάρτον σοι. Οἱ ἐχθροί μου εἶπαν
κακά μοι · πότε ἀποθανεῖται καὶ ἀπολεῖται τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ; Καὶ
εἰ εἰσεπορεύετο τοῦ ἰδεῖν, μάτην ἐλάλει · ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ συνήγαγεν ἀνομίαν ἑαυτῷ · ἐξεπορεύετο ἔξω, καὶ ἐλάλει. Ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ
κατ᾿ ἐμοῦ ἐψιθύριζον πάντες οἱ ἐχθροί μου, κατ᾿ ἐμοῦ ἐλογίζοντο
κακά μοι · λόγον παράνομον κατέθεντο κατ᾿ ἐμοῦ · μὴ ὁ κοιμώμενος οὐχὶ προσθήσει τοῦ ἀναστῆναι. Καὶ γὰρ ὁ ἄνθρωπος τῆς εἰρήνης μου, ἐφ᾿ ὃν ἤλπισα, ὁ ἐσθίων ἄρτους μου, ἐμεγάλυνεν ἐπ᾿
ἐμὲ πτερνισμόν. Σὺ δὲ Κύριε ἐλέησόν με, καὶ ἀνάστησόν με, καὶ
ἀνταποδώσω αὐτοῖς. Ἐν τούτῳ ἔγνων, ὅτι τεθέληκάς με, ὅτι οὐ
μὴ ἐπιχαρῇ ὁ ἐχθρός μου ἐπ᾿ ἐμέ. Ἐμοῦ δὲ διὰ τὴν ἀκακίαν ἀντελάβου, καὶ ἐβεβαίωσάς με ἐνώπιόν σου εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα. Εὐλογητός Κύριος ὁ Θεός Ἰσραήλ ἀπὸ τοῦ αἰῶνος, καὶ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα ·
γένοιτο γένοιτο.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ΜΑʹ. XLI.**

Εἰς τὸ τέλος, συνέσεως τοῖς υἱοῖς Κορέ, (Ψαλμὸς τῷ Δαυίδ).
Ὃν τρόπον ἐπιποθεῖ ἡ ἔλαφος ἐπὶ τὰς πηγὰς τῶν ὑδάτων, οὕτως
ἐπιποθεῖ ἡ ψυχή μου πρὸς σὲ ὁ Θεός · ἐδίψησεν ἡ ψυχή μου πρὸς
τὸν Θεὸν τὸν ἰσχυρὸν τὸν ζῶντα · πότε ἥξω καὶ ὀφθήσομαι τῷ
προσώπῳ τοῦ Θεοῦ; Ἐγενήθη τὰ δάκρυά μου ἐμοὶ ἄρτος ἡμέρας
καὶ νυκτὸς, ἐν τῷ λέγεσθαί μοι καθ᾿ ἑκάστην ἡμέραν · ποῦ ἐστιν

**PSALM XXXIX.**

16 (Cont.) ...all those who seek Thee, (O Lord), shall rejoice and be glad in Thee; and let them say continually, "The Lord be magnified," they that love Thy salvation.
17 But as for me, I am poor and needy; the Lord shall have care of me.
18 My helper and My protector art Thou; O my God, do not delay.

**PSALM XL.**

To the End, a Psalm of David.
1 Blessed is he that understandeth concerning the poor and needy; in the evil day shall the Lord deliver him.
2 The Lord preserve him and keep him alive; and bless him on the earth,
3 And deliver him not into the hands of his enemies.
4 The Lord help him upon his bed of pain; Thou hast turned all his bed into [health] in his sickness.
5 I said, "O Lord, have mercy on me; heal my soul, for I have sinned against Thee."
6 Mine enemies spoke evil against me: "When shall he die, and his name perish?"
7 And if he came in to see [me], he spoke vanity; his heart gathered iniquity to itself. He went forth, and spoke.
8 Together against me did all mine enemies whisper; against me they devised evil. They laid a lawless word against me: "Shall he that sleepeth not add to rise up?"
9 For even the man of my peace, upon whom I had hoped, he that ate of my bread, lifted up his heel against me.
10 But Thou, O Lord, have mercy upon me, and raise me up, and I shall repay them.
11 By this I have known that Thou hast desired me, because my enemy shall not rejoice over me.
12 But as for me, because of my blamelessness Thou hast upheld [me], and hast established me before Thy face forever.
13 Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting and to everlasting. Amen, Amen.

**PSALM XLI.**

To the End, a Psalm of Understanding for the Sons of Korah, (A Psalm of David).
1 As the hart longeth for the springs of water, so longeth my soul for Thee, O God.
2 My soul hath thirsted for the strong, the living God. When shall I come and appear before the face of God?
3 My tears have been my bread day and night, while it is said unto me daily: "Where is Thy God?"
