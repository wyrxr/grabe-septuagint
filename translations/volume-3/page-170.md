ΚΕΦ. Δ'. IV.
16 τοῦ νεανίσκου τοῦ δευτέρου, ὃς στήσεται ἀντ᾽ αὐτοῦ. Οὐκ **ἔστι** πε-
   ρασμὸς τῷ παντὶ λαῷ, τοῖς πᾶσιν ὅσοι ἐγένοντο ἔμπροσθεν αὐτῶν,
   καί γε οἱ ἔσχατοι οὐκ εὐφρανθήσονται ἐν αὐτῷ· ὅτι καί γε τοῦτο
17 ματαιότης καὶ προαίρεσις πνεύματος. Φύλαξον τὸν πόδα σου ἐν ᾧ
   ἂν πορεύῃ εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ ἐγγὺς τοῦ ἀκούειν· ὑπὲρ δῶ-
   μα τῶν ἀφρόνων θυσία σου, ὅτι οὐκ εἰσὶν εἰδότες τοῦ ποιῆσαι κακόν.

   ΚΕΦ. Ε΄. V.

1  Μὴ σπεῦδε ἐπὶ στόματί σου, καὶ καρδία σου μὴ ταχυνέτω, τοῦ
   ἐξενέγκαι λόγον πρὸ προσώπου τοῦ Θεοῦ· ὅτι ὁ Θεὸς ἐν τῷ οὐρα-
   νῷ, καὶ σὺ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς· ἐπὶ τούτῳ ἔστωσαν οἱ λόγοι σου ὀλίγοι.
2  Ὅτι παραγίνεται ἐνύπνιον ἐν πλήθει περισπασμοῦ, καὶ φωνὴ ἀφρό-
3  νος ἐν πλήθει λόγων. Καθὼς ἂν εὔξῃ εὐχὴν τῷ Θεῷ, μὴ χρονίσῃς
   τοῦ ἀποδοῦναι αὐτήν, ὅτι οὐκ ἔστι θέλημα ἐν ἄφροσι· σὺ οὖν ὅσα
4  ἂν εὔξῃ, ἀπόδος· ἀγαθὸν τὸ μὴ εὔξασθαί σε, ἢ τὸ εὔξασθαί σε καὶ
5  μὴ ἀποδοῦναι. Μὴ δῷς τὸ στόμα σου τοῦ ἐξαμαρτεῖν τὴν σάρκα σου,
   καὶ μὴ εἴπῃς πρὸ προσώπου τοῦ Θεοῦ, ὅτι ἄγνοιά ἐστιν· ἵνα μὴ
   ὀργισθῇ ὁ Θεὸς ἐπὶ φωνῇ σου, καὶ διαφθείρῃ τὰ ποιήματα χειρῶν
6  σου. Ὅτι ἐν πλήθει ἐνυπνίων καὶ ματαιοτήτων καὶ λόγων πολλῶν,
   ὅτι σὺν τὸν Θεὸν φοβοῦ.
7  Ἐὰν συκοφαντίαν πένητος καὶ ἁρπαγὴν
   κρίματος καὶ δικαιοσύνης ἴδῃς ἐν χώρᾳ, μὴ θαυμάσῃς ἐπὶ τῷ πράγ-
   ματι· ὅτι ὑψηλὸς ἐπάνω ὑψηλοῦ φυλάσσει, καὶ ὑψηλοὶ ἐπ᾽ αὐτοῖς.
8  Καὶ περίσσεια γῆς ἐπὶ παντὶ ἐστι βασιλεὺς τοῦ ἀγροῦ εἰργασμέ-
9  νου. Ἀγαπῶν ἀργύριον, οὐ πλησθήσεται ἀργυρίου· καὶ τίς ἠγά-
10 πησεν ἐν πλήθει, αὐτῷ γέννημα; Καί γε τοῦτο ματαιότης. Ἐν
   πλήθει ἀγαθωσύνης ἐπληθύνθησαν οἱ ἔσθοντες αὐτήν· καὶ τίς ἀν-
11 δρεία τῷ παρ᾽ αὐτῆς; ὅτι ἀρχὴ τοῦ ὁρᾷν ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτοῦ. Γλυκὺς
   ὕπνος τοῦ δούλου, εἰ ὀλίγον καὶ εἰ πολὺ φάγεται· καὶ τῷ ἐμπλη-
12 σθέντι τοῦ πλουττῆσαι οὐκ ἔστι ἀφίων αὐτὸν τοῦ ὑπνῶσαι. Ἔστιν
   ἀῤῥωστία ἣν ἴδον ὑπὸ τὸν ἥλιον, πλοῦτον φυλασσόμενον τῷ παρ᾽
13 αὐτοῦ εἰς κακίαν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀπολεῖται ὁ πλοῦτος ἐκεῖνος ἐν περι-
   σπασμῷ (αὐτοῦ) πονηρῷ· καὶ ἐγέννησεν υἱόν, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν χειρὶ
14 αὐτοῦ οὐδέν· καθὼς ἐξῆλθεν ἀπὸ γαστρὸς μητρὸς αὐτοῦ γυμνός,
   ἐπιστρέφει τοῦ πορευθῆναι ὡς ἥκει, καὶ οὐδὲν λήψεται ἐν μόχθῳ
15 αὐτοῦ, ἵνα πορευθῇ ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ· καί γε τοῦτο πονηρὰ ἀῤῥω-

**CHAPTER 4**

**16** [concerning] the second young man who shall stand in his stead. There is no end to all the people,
    even to all them that were before them;
    and verily, the latter ones shall not rejoice in him:
    for this also is vanity and a vexation of spirit.
**17** Guard thy foot when thou goest into the house of God;
    and be near to hear.
    Thy sacrifice is more [acceptable] than the house of the foolish;
    for they know not that they do evil.

**CHAPTER 5**

**1** Be not rash with thy mouth,
    and let not thy heart be hasty to utter a word before the face of God:
    for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth;
    therefore let thy words be few.
**2** For a dream cometh through a multitude of distraction,
    and a fool's voice in a multitude of words.
**3** When thou vowest a vow unto God,
    delay not to pay it; for there is no pleasure in fools:
    therefore whatsoever thou vowest, pay.
**4** Better is it that thou shouldest not vow,
    than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.
**5** Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin;
    and say not before the face of God that it was an error:
    lest God be wroth at thy voice,
    and destroy the works of thy hands.
**6** For in a multitude of dreams, and of vanities, and of many words;
    [therefore] altogether fear thou God.
**7** If thou seest the oppression of the poor,
    and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province,
    marvel not at the matter:
    for a high one watcheth over a high one,
    and high ones are over them.
**8** And the abundance of the earth is upon all;
    [thus is] a king of the cultivated field.
**9** He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver;
    and who hath loved abundance? For him [is there] increase?
**10** And verily, this also is vanity.
    In the increase of good things are they multiplied that eat them;
    and what advantage is there to the owner thereof,
    save the beginning of beholding [it] with his eyes?
**11** Sweet is the sleep of the servant,
    whether he eat little or much;
    but to him that is filled with riches, there is none allowing him to sleep.
**12** There is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun:
    riches kept by its owner for his own hurt,
**13** and that wealth shall perish in his grievous misfortune;
    and he begat a son, but there is nothing in his hand.
**14** As he came forth from his mother's womb naked,
    so shall he return to go as he came;
    and he shall take nothing from his labour,
    that he may carry in his hand.
**15** And verily, this also is a grievous misery.
