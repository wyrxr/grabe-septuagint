**ΔΑΝΙΗΛ. ΚΕΦ. ΙΒʹ.**

8 σκορπισμὸν λαοῦ ἡγιασμένου, καὶ γνώσονται πάντα ταῦτα. Κἀγὼ
9 ἤκουσα, καὶ οὐ συνῆκα, καὶ εἶπα· Κύριε τί ἔσχατα τούτων; Καὶ
10 εἶπε· δεῦρο Δανιήλ, ὅτι ἐμπεφραγμένοι καὶ ἐσφραγισμένοι οἱ λό-
11 γοι, ἕως καιροῦ πέρας ἐκλεγῶσιν, καὶ ἐκλευκανθῶσι, καὶ πυρωθῶ-
12 σι, καὶ ἁγιασθῶσι πολλοί· καὶ ἀνομήσουσιν ἄνομοι, καὶ οὐ συνή-
13 σουσι πάντες ἄνομοι, καὶ οἱ νοήμονες συνήσουσιν. Καὶ ἀπὸ και-
14 ροῦ παραλλάξεως τοῦ ἐνδελεχισμοῦ, ἀφ᾿ οὗ ἀναστῇ ἡ θυσία δια-
15 παντός, καὶ ἑτοιμασθῇ δοθῆναι τὸ βδέλυγμα τῆς ἐρημώσεως ἡμέραι
16 χίλιαι διακόσιαι ἐνενήκοντα. Μακάριος ὁ ὑπομείνας καὶ φθάσας
17 εἰς ἡμέρας χιλίας τριακοσίας τριακονταπέντε. Καὶ σὺ δεῦρο, καὶ
18 ἀναπαύου· ἔτι γὰρ ἡμέραι εἰσὶ καὶ ὧραι εἰς ἀναπλήρωσιν συν-
19 τελείας, καὶ ἀναπαύσῃ καὶ ἀναστήσῃ εἰς τὸν κλῆρόν σου, εἰς
20 συντέλειαν ἡμερῶν. Ὄρασις ιδ´. Ὄρασις ιβ´. Καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς
21 Ἀστυάγης προσετέθη πρὸς τοὺς πατέρας αὐτοῦ· καὶ παρέλαβε
22 Κῦρος ὁ Πέρσης τὴν βασιλείαν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἦν Δανιὴλ συμβιω-
23 τὴς τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ ἔνδοξος ὑπὲρ πάντας τοὺς φίλους αὐτοῦ.
24 Καὶ ἦν εἴδωλον τοῖς Βαβυλωνίοις ᾧ ὄνομα Βήλ, καὶ ἐδαπανῶντο
25 εἰς αὐτὸν ἑκάστης ἡμέρας σεμιδάλεως ἀρτάβαι δεκαδύς, καὶ πρό-
26 βατα τεσσαράκοντα καὶ οἴνου μετρηταὶ ἕξ. Καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐσέ-
27 βετο αὐτόν, καὶ ἐπορεύετο καθ᾽ ἑκάστην ἡμέραν προσκυνεῖν αὐτῷ·
28 Δανιὴλ δὲ προσεκύνει τῷ Θεῷ αὐτοῦ· καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ βασιλεύς·
29 Διατί οὐ προσκυνεῖς τῷ Βήλ; Ὁ δὲ εἶπεν· ὅτι οὐ σέβομαι εἴδω-
30 λα χειροποίητα, ἀλλὰ τὸν ζῶντα Θεόν, τὸν κτίσαντα τὸν οὐρα-
31 νὸν καὶ τὴν γῆν, καὶ ἔχοντα πάσης σαρκὸς κυρείαν. Καὶ εἶπεν
32 αὐτῷ ὁ βασιλεύς· οὐ δοκεῖ σοι Βήλ εἶναι ζῶν Θεός; ἢ οὐχ ὁρᾷς
33 ὅσα ἐσθίει καὶ πίνει καθ᾽ ἑκάστην ἡμέραν; Καὶ εἶπε Δανιὴλ γε-
34 λάςας· μὴ πλανῶ βασιλεῦ, οὗτος γὰρ ἔσωθεν μὲν ἐστὶ πηλός, ἔξω-
35 θεν δὲ χαλκός, καὶ οὐ βέβρωκεν, οὐδὲ πέπωκε πώποτε. Καὶ θυ-
36 μωθεὶς ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐκάλεσε τοὺς ἱερεῖς αὐτοῦ· καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς·
37 ἐὰν μὴ εἴπητέ μοι, τίς ὁ κατεσθίων τὴν δαπάνην ταύτην, ἀπο-
38 θανεῖσθε· ἐὰν δὲ ἀποδείξητε, ὅτι ὁ Βὴλ κατεσθίει αὐτά, ἀποθα-
39 νεῖται Δανιήλ, ὅτι ἐβλασφήμησεν εἰς τὸν Βήλ· καὶ εἶπε Δανιὴλ
40 τῷ βασιλεῖ· γινέσθω κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμά σου. Καὶ ἦσαν οἱ ἱερεῖς τοῦ
41 Βὴλ ἑβδομήκοντα χωρὶς γυναικῶν καὶ παιδίων· καὶ ἦλθεν ὁ βα-
42 σιλεὺς μετὰ Δανιὴλ εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Βήλ. Καὶ εἶπαν οἱ ἱερεῖς
43 τοῦ Βήλ· ἰδοὺ ἡμεῖς ἀποτρέχομεν ἔξω, σὺ δέ, βασιλεῦ, παράθες

**Chapter 12**

**8** the dispersion of the holy people, and then shall all these things be known."
**9** And I heard, but understood not; then said I, "O my Lord, what shall be the end of these things?"
**10** And he said, "Go thy way, Daniel; for the words are closed up and sealed until the time of the end.
**11** Many shall be chosen, and be made white, and be purified, and be sanctified; and the lawless shall act lawlessly, and none of the lawless shall understand, but the wise shall understand.
**12** And from the time of the removal of the continual [offering], and from when the continual sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination of desolation shall be prepared to be set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.
**13** Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh unto the one thousand three hundred and thirty-five days. And as for thee, go thou thy way, and rest; for yet there are days and hours unto the full end, and thou shalt rest and shalt stand up in thy lot, unto the end of the days."

**Vision 14. Vision 12.**

**1** And King Astyages was gathered unto his fathers; and Cyrus the Persian took his kingdom.
**2** And Daniel was a fellow-dweller with the king, and more glorious than all his friends.
**3** Now there was an idol among the Babylonians whose name was Bel, and there were spent upon him every day twelve artabas of fine flour, and forty sheep, and six measures of wine.
**4** And the king did worship him, and went every day to worship him. But Daniel worshipped his own God. And the king said unto him,
**5** "Why dost thou not worship Bel?" And he said, "Because I worship not idols made with hands,
**6** but the living God, who created the heaven and the earth, and hath dominion over all flesh."
**7** And the king said unto him, "Dost thou not think that Bel is a living God? Or dost thou not see how much he eateth and drinketh every day?"
**8** And Daniel said, laughing, "O king, be not deceived; for he is but clay within,
**9** and bronze without, and hath never eaten nor drunk anything." And the king, being enraged, called his priests and said unto them, "If ye tell me not who it is that doth consume this expenditure, ye shall die. But if ye prove that Bel doth consume these things, then Daniel shall die, because he hath blasphemed against Bel."
**10** And Daniel said unto the king, "Let it be according to thy word."
**11** Now there were the priests of Bel, seventy in number, besides their wives and children; and the king came with Daniel into the temple of Bel.
**12** And the priests of Bel said, "Behold, we go forth without; but thou, O king, do thou set forth
