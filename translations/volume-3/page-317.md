ΚΕΦ. ΚΔʹ. ΚΕʹ. ΙΕΡΕΜΙΑΣ 1255
καὶ ἀνοικοδομήσω αὐτούς, καὶ οὐ μὴ καθελῶ αὐτούς, καὶ κατα-
φυτεύσω αὐτούς, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἐκτίλω. Καὶ δώσω αὐτοῖς καρδίαν 7
τοῦ εἰδέναι αὐτοὺς ἐμέ, ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι Κύριος, καὶ ἔσονται μοι
εἰς λαόν, καὶ ἐγὼ ἔσομαι αὐτοῖς εἰς Θεόν, ὅτι ἐπιστραφήσονται
ἐπ᾿ ἐμὲ ἐξ ὅλης τῆς καρδίας αὐτῶν. Καὶ ὡς τὰ σῦκα τὰ πονηρά, 8
ἃ οὐ βρωθήσεται ἀπὸ πονηρίας αὐτῶν, τάδε λέγει Κύριος, οὕ-
τως παραδώσω τὸν Σεδεκίαν βασιλέα Ἰούδα, καὶ τοὺς μεγί-
στανας αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὸ κατάλοιπον Ἱερουσαλὴμ τοὺς ὑπολειμ-
μένους ἐν τῇ πόλει ταύτῃ, καὶ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ.
Καὶ δώσω αὐτοὺς εἰς διασκορπισμὸν εἰς πάσας τὰς βασιλείας 9
τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἔσονται εἰς κακά, καὶ εἰς ὀνειδισμὸν, καὶ εἰς πα-
ραβολὴν, καὶ εἰς μῖσος, καὶ εἰς κατάραν ἐν παντὶ τόπῳ οὗ ἔξωσα
αὐτοὺς ἐκεῖ. Καὶ ἀποστελῶ εἰς αὐτοὺς τὸν λιμὸν καὶ τὸν θά- 10
νατον, καὶ τὴν μάχαιραν, ἕως ἂν ἐκλείπωσιν ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς, ἧς
ἔδωκα αὐτοῖς καὶ τοῖς πατράσιν αὐτῶν.

Ὁ ΛΟΓΟΣ Ο ΓΕΝΟΜΕΝΟΣ ΠΡΟΣ ΙΕΡΕΜΙΑΝ ἐπὶ 1
πάντα τὸν λαὸν Ἰούδα ἐν τῷ ἔτει τῷ τετάρτῳ τοῦ Ἰωακὶμ
υἱοῦ Ἰωσία βασιλέως Ἰούδα, ( αὐτὸς ἐνιαυτὸς πρῶτος τῷ Να-
βουχοδονόσορ βασιλεῖ Βαβυλῶνος ) ἐν ἐλάλησε Ἱερεμίας προ- 2
φήτης πρὸς πάντα τὸν λαὸν Ἰούδα, καὶ πρὸς τοὺς κατοικοῦν-
τας Ἱερουσαλήμ, λέγων. Ἐν τρισκαιδεκάτῳ ἔτει τοῦ βασιλέως 3
Ἰωσία υἱοῦ Ἀμὼς βασιλέως Ἰούδα, καὶ ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης
εἴκοσι καὶ τρία ἔτη, ἐγενήθη λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς μὲ, καὶ ἐλά-
λησα πρὸς ὑμᾶς ὀρθρίζων, καὶ λέγων, καὶ ἀπέστελλον πρὸς ὑ- 4
μᾶς τοὺς δούλους μου τοὺς προφήτας, ὄρθρου ἀποστέλλων, καὶ
οὐκ εἰσηκούσατε, καὶ οὐ προσέσχετε τοῖς ὠσὶν ὑμῶν τοῦ ἀκοῦ-
σαι, λέγων· ἀποστράφητε ἕκαστος ἀπὸ τῆς ὁδοῦ αὐτοῦ τῆς πο- 5
νηρᾶς, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν πονηρῶν ἐπιτηδευμάτων ὑμῶν, καὶ κατοική-
σετε ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, ἧς ἔδωκα ὑμῖν καὶ τοῖς πατράσιν ὑμῶν, ἀπ᾿
αἰῶνος καὶ ἕως τοῦ αἰῶνος. Μὴ πορεύεσθε ὀπίσω θεῶν ἀλλοτρί- 6
ων, τοῦ δουλεύειν αὐτοῖς, καὶ τοῦ προσκυνεῖν αὐτοῖς, ὅπως μὴ
παροργίζητέ με ἐν τοῖς ἔργοις τῶν χειρῶν ὑμῶν, τοῦ κακῶσαι

**Jeremiah 24**
**6** "and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.
**7** And I will give them a heart to know Me, that I am the Lord; and they shall be My people, and I will be their God; for they shall return unto Me with all their heart."
**8** "And as the bad figs, which cannot be eaten for their badness — thus saith the Lord — so will I deliver Zedekiah, the king of Judah, and his magnates, and the remnant of Jerusalem, those that remain in this city, and those that dwell in Egypt.
**9** And I will deliver them to be scattered into all the kingdoms of the earth, and they shall be for evil, and for a reproach, and for a proverb, and for a hatred, and for a curse in every place whither I have driven them out.
**10** And I will send upon them the famine, and the death, and the sword, until they be consumed from the land which I gave unto them and to their fathers."

**Jeremiah 25**
**1** THE WORD THAT CAME TO JEREMIAH concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king of Judah (the same was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon);
**2** Therein spake Jeremiah the prophet unto all the people of Judah, and to those that dwelt in Jerusalem, saying:
**3** "From the thirteenth year of Josiah, the son of Amon, king of Judah, even unto this day, these three and twenty years, the word of the Lord hath come unto me, and I have spoken unto you, rising up early and speaking;
**4** and I have sent unto you My servants the prophets, sending them early [and often]; yet ye have not hearkened, nor inclined your ears to hear, saying:
**5** 'Turn ye again every one from his evil way, and from the wickedness of your doings, and dwell in the land that I have given unto you and to your fathers, from everlasting even unto everlasting.
**6** Go ye not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, that ye provoke Me not to anger with the works of your hands, to your own hurt.'"
