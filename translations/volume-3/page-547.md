**ΚΕΦ. Ϛ΄. Ζ΄. ΜΙΧΑΙΑΣ. 1485**
¹³ σε ἐπὶ ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις σου.
¹⁴ Σὺ φάγε καὶ οὐ μὴ ἐμπλησθῇς· καὶ σκοτάσει ἐν σοί, καὶ ἐκνεύσει, καὶ οὐ μὴ διασωθῇς, καὶ ὅσοι
    ἂν διωσθῶσιν, εἰς ῥομφαίαν παραδοθήσονται.
¹⁵ Σὺ σπερεῖς, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἀμήσῃς· σὺ πιέσεις ἐλαίαν, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἀλείφῃ ἔλαιον· καὶ οἶνον, καὶ οὐ μὴ πίῃς· καὶ ἀφανισθήσεται νόμιμα λαοῦ μου.
¹⁶ Καὶ ἐφύλαξας τὰ δικαιώματα Ζαμβρί, καὶ πάντα τὰ ἔργα οἴκου Ἀχαάβ, καὶ ἐπορεύθητε ἐν ταῖς βουλαῖς αὐτῶν, ὅπως παραδῶ σε εἰς ἀφανισμόν, καὶ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας αὐτὴν εἰς συρισμόν, καὶ ὀνείδη λαῶν λήψεσθε.

**ΚΕΦ. Ζ΄. VII.**

¹ ΟΙΜΟΙ, ὅτι ἐγενόμην ὡς συνάγων καλάμην ἐν ἀμητῷ, καὶ ὡς ἐπιφυλλίδα ἐν τρυγητῷ, οὐχ ὑπάρχοντος βότρυος τοῦ φαγεῖν τὰ πρωτόγονα. οἴμοι ψυχῇ, ὅτι ἀπόλωλεν εὐλαβὴς ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς,
² καὶ κατορθῶν ἐν ἀνθρώποις οὐχ ὑπάρχει· πάντες εἰς αἵματα δικάζονται, ἕκαστος τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ ἐκθλίβουσιν ἐκθλιβῆ, ἐπὶ
³ τὸ κακὸν τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν ἑτοιμάζουσιν. ὁ ἄρχων αἰτεῖ, καὶ ὁ κριτὴς εἰρηνικοὺς λόγους ἐλάλησε, καταθύμιον ψυχῆς αὐτοῦ ἔστιν·
⁴ καὶ ἐξελοῦμαι τὰ ἀγαθὰ αὐτῶν, ὡς σὴς ἐκτρώγων, καὶ βαδίζων ἐπὶ κανόνος ἐν ἡμέρᾳ σκοπιᾶς. οὐαὶ οὐαὶ αἱ ἐκδικήσεις σου ἥκασι, νῦν ἔσονται κλαυθμοὶ αὐτῶν.
⁵ Μὴ καταπιστεύετε ἐν φίλοις, καὶ μὴ ἐλπίζετε ἐπὶ ἡγουμένοις, ἀπὸ τῆς συγκοίτου σου φύλαξαι, τοῦ ἀναθέσθαι αὐτῇ τι·
⁶ διότι υἱὸς ἀτιμάζει πατέρα, καὶ θυγάτηρ ἐπαναστήσεται ἐπὶ τὴν μητέρα αὐτῆς, καὶ νύμφη ἐπὶ τὴν πενθερὰν αὐτῆς, ἐχθροὶ πάντες ἄνδρες οἱ ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ.
⁷ Ἐγὼ δὲ ἐπὶ τὸν Κύριον ἐπιβλέψομαι, ὑπομενῶ ἐπὶ τῷ Θεῷ τῷ σωτῆρί μου, εἰσακούσεταί μου ὁ Θεός μου.
⁸ Μὴ ἐπίχαιρε μοι ἡ ἐχθρά μου, ὅτι πέπτωκα, καὶ ἀναστήσομαι· διότι ἐὰν καθίσω ἐν τῷ σκότει ὁ Κύριος φωτιεῖ μοι.
⁹ Ὀργὴν Κυρίου ὑποίσω, ὅτι ἡμαρτον αὐτῷ, ἕως τοῦ δικαιῶσαι αὐτὸν τὴν δίκην μου· καὶ ποιήσει τὸ κρίμα μου, καὶ ἐξάξει με εἰς τὸ φῶς· ὄψομαι τὴν δικαιοσύνην αὐτοῦ,
¹⁰ καὶ ὄψεται ἡ ἐχθρά μου, καὶ περιβαλεῖται αἰσχύνην, ἡ λέγουσα πρὸς μέ· Ποῦ Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου; οἱ ὀφθαλμοί μου ἐπόψονται αὐτήν, νῦν ἔσται εἰς καταπάτημα ὡς πηλὸς ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς.
¹¹ Ἡμέρα ἀλοιφῆς πλίνθου, ἐξαλείψεις σου ἡ ἡμέρα ἐκείνη, καὶ ἀπώσεται νόμιμα ἡ ἡμέρα ἐκείνη.
¹² Καὶ αἱ πόλεις σου ἥξουσιν εἰς ὁμαλισμόν,

#### Chapter 6
**13** thee for thy sins.
**14** Thou, eat — yet shalt not be filled; and darkness shall be within thee, and thou shalt turn away, and shalt not be saved; and as many as shall be driven away, they shall be delivered unto the sword.
**15** Thou shalt sow, and shalt not reap; thou shalt press the olive, and shalt not anoint thyself with oil; and the wine shalt thou not drink; and the ordinances of My people shall be utterly destroyed.
**16** For thou hast kept the statutes of Zimri, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye have walked in their counsels, that I may deliver thee unto utter destruction, and those who dwell therein unto a [cause for] scorn, and reproaches of the peoples shall ye receive.

#### Chapter 7
**1** Woe is me! for I am become as one gathering stubble in the harvest, and as gleanings in the vintage; there is no cluster of grapes to eat, nor the early fruit. Woe to my soul! for the godly man hath perished from the earth,
**2** and there is none among men who acts uprightly; all plead for bloodshed, each one his neighbour; they oppress him who is oppressed. For evil they prepare their hands.
**3** The ruler demands, and the judge hath spoken peaceable words; it is the desire of his soul.
**4** And I will take away their good things, like a moth eating away; and [like one] walking by rule in the day of visitation. Woe, woe! Thy vengeances are come; now shall be their lamentations.
**5** Trust ye not in friends, and hope ye not in leaders; from her that lieth in thy bosom guard thyself, from committing anything to her;
**6** for a son dishonoureth his father, and a daughter shall rise up against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; all the men who are in his house shall be his enemies.
**7** But I will look unto the Lord; I will wait upon God, my Saviour; my God shall hear me.
**8** Rejoice not against me, O my enemy, because I have fallen, yet I shall arise; for if I dwell in darkness, the Lord shall enlighten me.
**9** I will bear the wrath of the Lord, because I have sinned against Him, until He plead my cause; and He shall execute my judgment, and He shall bring me forth into the light; I shall behold His righteousness.
**10** And my enemy shall behold [it], and she shall be clothed with shame, she who saith unto me: "Where is the Lord thy God?" Mine eyes shall look upon her; now shall she be for a treading down, as mire in the streets.
**11** A day for the plastering of brick; that day is for thy obliterations, and that day shall abolish ordinances.
**12** And thy cities shall come unto leveling,
