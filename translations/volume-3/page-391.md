ΚΕΦ. Α΄. ΙΕΖΕΚΙΗΛ. 1329
συστρεφομένων ἀνάμεσον τῶν ζώων καὶ φέγγος τοῦ πυρὸς, καὶ
ἐκ τοῦ πυρὸς ἐξεπορεύετο ὡς ἀστραπὴ, καὶ τὰ ζῶα ἔτρεχον, καὶ 14
ἀνέκαμπτον ὡς εἶδος τοῦ Βεζέκ. Καὶ ἴδον, καὶ ἰδοὺ τροχὸς εἷς 15
ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς ἐχόμενος τῶν ζώων τοῖς τέσσαρσι. Καὶ τὸ εἶδος 16
τῶν τροχῶν ὡς εἶδος θαρσεῖς, καὶ ὁμοίωμα ἐν τοῖς τέσσαρσι· καὶ
τὸ ἔργον αὐτῶν ἦν καθὼς ἂν εἴη τροχὸς ἐπὶ τροχῷ, ἐπὶ τὰ τέσσαρα 17
μέρη αὐτῶν ἐπορεύοντο· οὐκ ἐπέστρεφον ἐν τῷ πορεύεσθαι
αὐτὰ, οὐδ᾽ οἱ νῶτοι αὐτῶν, καὶ ἴζον αὐτοῖς· καὶ ἴδον αὐτὰ, 18
καὶ οἱ νῶτοι αὐτῶν πλήρεις ὀφθαλμῶν κυκλόθεν τοῖς τέσσαρσιν.
Καὶ ἐν τῷ πορεύεσθαι τὰ ζῶα ἐπορεύοντο οἱ τροχοὶ ἐχόμενοι 19
αὐτῶν· καὶ ἐν τῷ ἐξαίρειν τὰ ζῶα ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς, ἐξήροντο οἱ
τροχοί. Οὗ ἂν ἦν ἡ νεφέλη, ἐκεῖ τὸ πνεῦμα τοῦ πορεύεσθαι, ἐπορεύοντο 20
τὰ ζῶα, καὶ οἱ τροχοὶ ἐξήροντο σὺν αὐτοῖς, διότι πνεῦμα
ζωῆς ἦν ἐν τοῖς τροχοῖς. Ἐν τῷ πορεύεσθαι αὐτὰ ἐπορεύοντο, 21
καὶ ἐν τῷ ἑστάναι αὐτὰ εἰστήκεισαν· καὶ ἐν τῷ ἐξαίρειν αὐτὰ ἀπὸ
τῆς γῆς, ἐξήροντο σὺν αὐτοῖς, ὅτι πνεῦμα ζωῆς ἐν τοῖς τροχοῖς
ἦν. Καὶ ὁμοίωμα ὑπὲρ κεφαλῆς αὐτῶν τῶν ζώων ὡσεὶ στερέωμα, 22
ὡς ὅρασις κρυστάλλου ἐκτεταμένον ἐπὶ τῶν πτερύγων αὐτῶν
ἐπάνωθεν, καὶ ὑποκάτω τοῦ στερεώματος αἱ πτέρυγες αὐτῶν ἐκτεταμέναι, 23
πτερυσοσόμεναι ἑτέρα τῇ ἑτέρᾳ, ἑκάστῳ δύο συνε-
ζευγμέναι, καλύπτουσαι τὰ σώματα (τὰ πρόσωπα) αὐτῶν. Καὶ 24
ἤκουον τὴν φωνὴν τῶν πτερύγων αὐτῶν ἐν τῷ πορεύεσθαι αὐτὰ,
ὡς φωνὴν ὕδατος πολλοῦ, ὡς φωνὴν ἱκανὸν· ἐν τῷ πορεύεσθαι
αὐτὰ φωνὴ τοῦ λόγου ὡς φωνὴ παρεμβολῆς, καὶ ἐν τῷ ἑστάναι
αὐτὰ, κατέπαυον αἱ πτέρυγες αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἰδοὺ φωνὴ ὑπεράνω τοῦ 25
στερεώματος τοῦ ὄντος ὑπὲρ κεφαλῆς αὐτῶν, ἐν τῷ ἑστάναι αὐτὰ
ἀνίεντο αἱ πτέρυγες αὐτῶν. Καὶ ὑπεράνω τοῦ στερεώματος τοῦ 26
ὑπὲρ κεφαλῆς αὐτῶν, ὡς ὅρασις λίθου σαπφείρου, ὁμοίωμα θρόνου
ἐπ᾽ αὐτῷ, καὶ ἐπὶ τοῦ ὁμοιώματος τοῦ θρόνου ὁμοίωμα ὡς εἶδος
ἀνθρώπου ἄνωθεν. Καὶ εἶδον ὡς ὄψιν ἠλέκτρου, ὡς ὅρασιν πυρὸς 27
ἔσωθεν αὐτοῦ κύκλῳ ἀπὸ δράσεως ὀσφύος καὶ ἐπάνω, καὶ ἀπὸ δράσεως
ὀσφύος καὶ ἕως κάτω εἶδον ὡς ὅρασιν πυρὸς, καὶ τὸ φέγγος αὐτοῦ 28
κύκλῳ ὡς ὅρασις τόξου, ὅταν ἦν ἐν τῇ νεφέλῃ ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ὑετοῦ,
οὕτως ἡ στάσις τοῦ φέγγους κυκλόθεν· αὕτη ἡ ὅρασις ὁμοίωμα
τῆς δόξης Κυρίου· καὶ εἶδον, καὶ πίπτω ἐπὶ πρόσωπόν μου, καὶ
ἤκουσα φωνὴν λαλοῦντος.

**13** whirling in the midst of the living creatures; and a brightness of the fire, and out of the fire went forth as a lightning flash. And the living creatures ran, and turned back as the appearance of Bezek.
**14** And I beheld, and lo, one wheel upon the earth alongside the four living creatures.
**15** And the appearance of the wheels was as the appearance of [one that is] bold, and a likeness [thereof was] in the four [of them].
**16** And their operation was as it were a wheel upon a wheel.
**17** Upon their four sides they went; they turned not when they went, nor their felloes; and they were set upon them.
**18** And I beheld them, and their felloes were full of eyes round about for the four.
**19** And when the living creatures went, the wheels went alongside them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels also were lifted up.
**20** Whithersoever the cloud was, there was the spirit of going; the living creatures went, and the wheels were lifted up with them, for the spirit of life was in the wheels.
**21** When they went, they went; and when they stood, they stood. And when they were lifted up from the earth, they were lifted up with them, for the spirit of life was in the wheels.
**22** And the likeness above the heads of the living creatures was as a firmament, as the appearance of crystal, stretched forth over their wings above;
**23** And beneath the firmament their wings were stretched forth, [wings about to save themselves] one to another; to each one two were joined, covering their bodies (their faces).
**24** And I heard the sound of their wings when they went, as the sound of many waters, as a mighty sound. When they went, the sound of the word was as the sound of a host, and when they stood, their wings ceased [their motion].
**25** And behold, a voice [came] from above the firmament that was over their heads. When they stood, their wings were lowered.
**26** And above the firmament that was over their heads, was as the appearance of a sapphire stone; the likeness of a throne was upon it, and upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man above.
**27** And I beheld as the appearance of electrum, as the appearance of fire within it round about, from the action of the loins and upward; and from the action of the loins and even downward, I beheld as the appearance of fire, and its brightness round about,
**28** as the appearance of the bow, when it is in the cloud in a day of rain. Such was the form of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice speaking.
