**Chapter 28**

<p><sup>8</sup> by the death of them that are wounded in the heart of the sea.
<sup>9</sup> Wilt thou still say, I am God, before them that slay thee? Yet thou art a man,
and not God, in the multitude of them that wound thee.
<sup>10</sup> Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers:
for I have spoken it, saith the Lord.</p>

<p><sup>11</sup> Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
<sup>12</sup> Son of man, take up a lamentation for the prince of Tyre, and say unto him,
Thus saith Adonai the Lord: Thou art a seal of [perfect] likeness,
full of wisdom, and a crown of beauty; thou wast brought forth
in the delight of the Paradise of God.
<sup>13</sup> Every precious stone didst thou wear: the sardius, the topaz, and the emerald,
and the carbuncle, and the sapphire, and the jasper, and silver, and gold,
and the ligure, and the agate, and the amethyst, and the chrysolite,
and the beryl, and the onyx; and with gold didst thou fill thy treasures
and thy storerooms within thee.
<sup>14</sup> From the day thou wast created, did they prepare [thee] with the Cherub,
the anointed one, that dwelleth [there]; and I placed thee in the holy mountain of God;
thou wast in the midst of the stones of fire.
<sup>15</sup> Thou wast blameless in thy ways from the day that thou wast created,
until the day that thine iniquities were found in thee.
<sup>16</sup> From the abundance of thy commerce, thou didst fill thy treasuries with iniquity,
and thou didst sin, and wast stricken from the mountain of God.
And the overshadowing Cherub brought thee forth from the midst of the stones of fire.
<sup>17</sup> Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty; thy wisdom was corrupted
with thy beauty. Because of the multitude of thy sins, I cast thee to the earth;
before kings did I deliver thee to be made an example of.
<sup>18</sup> Because of the multitude of thy sins and the iniquities of thy commerce,
thou hast profaned thy sanctuaries; and I will bring forth a fire from the midst of thee,
this shall devour thee; and I will give thee for ashes upon thy land
before all them that behold thee.
<sup>19</sup> And all they that know thee among the nations shall be dismayed at thee;
thou art become a desolation, and thou shalt exist no more for ever.</p>

<p><sup>20</sup> Against Sidon. And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
<sup>21</sup> Son of man, set thy face against Sidon, and prophesy against it, and say,
<sup>22</sup> Thus saith Adonai the Lord: Behold, I am against thee, O Sidon,
and I will be glorified in thee, and they shall know that I am the Lord,
when I shall execute judgments in thee, and I shall be sanctified in thee.
<sup>23</sup> And I will send forth upon thee death, and blood (and death) shall be in thy streets;
and the wounded shall fall in the midst thereof by swords within thee, round about thee,</p>
