ΚΕΦ. ΛΖʹ. ΛΗʹ. ΙΕΖΕΚΙΗΛ 1395
ἀπαγγελεῖς ἡμῖν; τί ἐστι ταῦτά σοι; Καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτούς· 19
τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναΐ Κύριος· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ λήψομαι τὴν φυλὴν Ἰωσήφ,
τὴν διὰ χειρὸς Ἐφραίμ, καὶ τὰς φυλὰς τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ τὰς προσκει-
μένας πρὸς αὐτόν, καὶ δώσω αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ τὴν φυλὴν τοῦ Ἰούδα,
καὶ ἔσονται εἰς ῥάβδον μίαν, καὶ ἔσονται ἐν ἐν τῇ χειρὶ Ἰούδα.
Καὶ ἔσονται αἱ ῥάβδοι, ἐφ᾿ αἷς σὺ ἔγραψας ἐπ᾿ αὐταῖς ἐν τῇ χειρί 20
σου ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐρεῖς αὐτοῖς· τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναΐ Κύριος 21
ὁ Θεός· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ λαμβάνω πάντα οἶκον Ἰσραὴλ ἐκ μέσου τῶν ἐ-
θνῶν, οὗ εἰσήλθοσαν ἐκεῖ, καὶ συνάξω αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν
περικύκλῳ αὐτῶν, καὶ εἰσάξω αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν γῆν τοῦ Ἰσραήλ,
καὶ δώσω αὐτοὺς εἰς ἔθνος ἓν ἐν τῇ γῇ μου, καὶ ἐν τοῖς ὄρεσι τοῦ 22
Ἰσραήλ· καὶ ἄρχων εἷς ἔσται πάντων αὐτῶν εἰς βασιλέα, καὶ οὐκ
ἔσονται οὐκέτι εἰς δύο ἔθνη, οὐδὲ μὴ διαιρεθῶσιν οὐκέτι εἰς δύο βα-
σιλείας, ἵνα μὴ μιαίνωνται ἔτι ἐν τοῖς εἰδώλοις αὐτῶν, ἐν οἷς ἡ- 23
μάρτοσαν ἐν αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἐν τοῖς προσοχθίσμασιν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐν
πάσαις ταῖς ἀσεβείαις αὐτῶν· καὶ ῥύσομαι αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ πασῶν τῶν
ἀνομιῶν αὐτῶν, ὧν ἡμάρτοσαν ἐν αὐταῖς, καὶ καθαριῶ αὐτούς,
καὶ ἔσονταί μοι εἰς λαόν, καὶ ἐγὼ Κύριος ἔσομαι αὐτοῖς εἰς Θεόν.
Καὶ ὁ δοῦλός μου Δαυὶδ ἄρχων ἓν ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῶν, καὶ ποιμὴν εἷς 24
ἔσται πάντων, ὅτι ἐν τοῖς προστάγμασί μου πορεύσονται, καὶ τὰ
κρίματά μου φυλάξονται, καὶ ποιήσουσιν αὐτά, καὶ κατοικήσουσιν 25
ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς αὐτῶν, ἣν ἐγὼ δέδωκα τῷ δούλῳ μου Ἰακώβ, οὗ κα-
τῴκησαν ἐκεῖ οἱ πατέρες αὐτῶν, καὶ κατοικήσουσιν ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς αὐ-
τοί, καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτῶν, καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ τῶν υἱῶν αὐτῶν ἕως αἰῶνος· καὶ
ἰδοὺ Δαυὶδ ὁ δοῦλός μου, ἄρχων αὐτῶν ἔσται εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα. Καὶ 26
διαθήσομαι αὐτοῖς διαθήκην εἰρήνης, καὶ διαθήκη αἰωνία ἔσται
μετ᾿ αὐτῶν· καὶ θήσω τὰ ἅγιά μου ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῶν εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα,
καὶ ἔσται ἡ κατασκήνωσίς μου ἐν αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἔσομαι αὐτοῖς εἰς 27
Θεόν, καὶ αὐτοὶ ἔσονταί μοι λαός. Καὶ γνώσονται τὰ ἔθνη, ὅτι 28
ἐγώ εἰμι Κύριος ὁ ἁγιάζων αὐτούς, ἐν τῷ εἶναι τὰ ἅγιά μου ἐν
μέσῳ αὐτῶν εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, λέγει Κύριος.

ΚΕΦ. ΛΗʹ. XXXVIII.

ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς μέ, λέγων· υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, 1.2
στήρισον τὸ πρόσωπόν σου ἐπὶ Γώγ, καὶ τὴν γῆν τοῦ Μαγὼγ ἄρ-

18 ...will not declare unto us? What mean these things to thee?"
19 And thou shalt say unto them: "Thus saith Adonai the Lord:
Behold, I will take the tribe of Joseph,
that which is by the hand of Ephraim,
and the tribes of Israel that cleave unto him;
and I will give them unto the tribe of Judah,
and they shall be as one stick,
and they shall be in in the hand of Judah."
20 And the sticks, whereupon thou hast written upon them,
shall be in thy hand before their eyes.
21 And thou shalt say unto them: "Thus saith Adonai the Lord God:
Behold, I take all the house of Israel from the midst of the nations,
whither they have gone in;
and I will gather them from all [the nations] round about them,
and I will bring them into the land of Israel;
22 and I will make them one nation in My land,
even in the mountains of Israel;
and one ruler shall be for all of them as king;
and they shall no longer be two nations,
neither shall they any longer be divided into two kingdoms;
23 that they may no longer defile themselves with their idols,
wherein they have sinned in them,
and with their abominations, and with all their impieties;
and I will deliver them from all their iniquities,
wherein they have sinned in them;
and I will cleanse them,
and they shall be unto Me a people,
and I the Lord shall be unto them a God.
24 And My servant David, [he shall be] one ruler in the midst of them;
and one shepherd shall be for all;
for in My ordinances shall they walk,
and My judgments shall they keep, and they shall perform them.
25 And they shall dwell upon their land,
which I have given to My servant Jacob,
where their fathers dwelt there;
and they shall dwell upon it, they themselves,
and their sons, and their sons' sons, for ever;
and behold, David My servant shall be their ruler for ever.
26 And I will make with them a covenant of peace;
and an everlasting covenant shall be with them;
and I will set My sanctuaries in the midst of them for ever.
27 And My dwelling-place shall be in them;
and I will be unto them a God,
and they shall be unto Me a people.
28 And the nations shall know that I am the Lord Who sanctifieth them,
in that My holy places [are] in the midst of them for ever," saith the Lord.

### Chapter 38

1 And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying:
2 "Son of man, set thy face against Gog,
and the land of Magog, [even] the ruler of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal."
