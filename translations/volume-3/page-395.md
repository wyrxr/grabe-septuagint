ΚΕΦ. Δʹ.
**4** σεις τὰς ἀδικίας τοῦ οἴκου ᾿Ισραὴλ ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῦ, κατὰ ἀριθμὸν τῶν ἡμερῶν πεντήκοντα καὶ ἑκατὸν ἡμέρας, ἃς κοιμηθήσῃ ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ λήψῃ τὰς ἀδικίας αὐτῶν.
**5** Καὶ ἐγὼ δέδωκά σοι τὰς δύο ἀδικίας αὐτῶν εἰς ἀριθμὸν ἡμερῶν ἐνενήκοντα καὶ ἑκατὸν ἡμέρας, καὶ λήψῃ τὰς ἀδικίας τοῦ οἴκου ᾿Ισραήλ.
**6** Καὶ συντελέσεις ταῦτα πάντα, καὶ κοιμηθήσῃ ἐπὶ τὸ πλευρόν σου τὸ δεξιὸν τὸ δεύτερον, καὶ λήψῃ τὰς ἀδικίας τοῦ οἴκου ᾿Ιούδα τεσσαράκοντα ἡμέρας, ἡμέραν εἰς ἐνιαυτὸν τέθεικά σοι.
**7** Καὶ εἰς συγκλεισμὸν ᾿Ιερουσαλὴμ ἑτοιμάσεις τὸ πρόσωπόν σου, καὶ τὸν βραχίονά σου στερεώσεις, καὶ προφητεύσεις ἐπ᾿ αὐτήν.
**8** Καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ δέδωκα ἐπὶ σὲ δεσμούς, καὶ οὐ μὴ στραφῇς ἀπὸ τοῦ πλευροῦ σου ἐπὶ τὸ πλευρόν σου, ἕως οὗ συντελεσθῶσιν αἱ ἡμέραι τοῦ συγκλεισμοῦ σου.
**9** Καὶ σὺ λάβε σεαυτῷ πυρούς, καὶ κριθάς, καὶ κύαμον, καὶ φακόν, καὶ κέγχρον, καὶ ὀλύραν, καὶ ἐμβαλεῖς αὐτὰ εἰς ἄγγος ἐν ὀστρακίνῳ· καὶ ποιήσεις αὐτὰ σεαυτῷ εἰς ἄρτους, καὶ κατὰ ἀριθμὸν τῶν ἡμερῶν, ἃς σὺ καθεύδεις ἐπὶ τοῦ πλευροῦ σου, ἐνενήκοντα καὶ ἑκατὸν ἡμέρας φάγεσαι αὐτά.
**10** Καὶ τὸ βρῶμά σου ὃ φάγεσαι ἐν σταθμίῳ, εἴκοσι σίχλους τὴν ἡμέραν φάγεσαι ἀπὸ καιροῦ, καὶ ἕως καιροῦ φάγεσαι αὐτά.
**11** Καὶ ὕδωρ ἐν μέτρῳ πίεσαι, τὸ ἕκτον τοῦ εἶν ἀπὸ καιροῦ ἕως καιροῦ πίεσαι.
**12** Καὶ ἐγκρυφίαν κρίθινον φάγεσαι αὐτά, ἐν βολβίτοις κόπρου ἀνθρωπίνης κατακρύψεις αὐτὰ κατ᾿ ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐρεῖς· τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ ᾿Ισραήλ· οὕτως φάγονται οἱ υἱοὶ ᾿Ισραὴλ ἀκάθαρτα ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν, οὗ διασκορπιῶ αὐτοὺς ἐκεῖ.
**13** Καὶ εἶπα· μηδαμῶς, Κύριε Κύριε Θεὲ τοῦ ᾿Ισραήλ· εἰ ἡ ψυχή μου οὐ μεμίανται ἐν ἀκαθαρτίᾳ, καὶ θνησιμαῖον καὶ θηριάλωτον οὐ βέβρωκα ἀπὸ τῆς γενέσεώς μου ἕως τοῦ νῦν, οὐδὲ εἰσελήλυθεν εἰς τὸ στόμα μου πᾶν κρέας εἴδωλον.
**14** Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς μέ· ἰδοὺ δέδωκά σοι βολβίτα βοῶν ἀντὶ τῶν βολβίτων τῶν ἀνθρωπίνων, καὶ ποιήσεις τοὺς ἄρτους σου ἐπ᾿ αὐτῶν.
**15** Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς μέ· υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ συντρίβω στήριγμα ἄρτου ἐν ᾿Ιερουσαλήμ, καὶ φάγονται ἄρτον ἐν σταθμῷ καὶ ἐν ἐνδείᾳ, καὶ ὕδωρ ἐν μέτρῳ, καὶ ἐν ἀφανισμῷ πίονται, ὅπως ἐνδεεῖς γένωνται ἄρτου καὶ ὕδατος·
**16** καὶ ἀφανισθήσεται ἄνθρωπος καὶ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ κακήσονται ἐν ταῖς ἀδικίαις αὐτῶν.

### Chapter 4

**4** [lay] the iniquities of the house of Israel upon it, according to the number
    of the days, one hundred and fifty days, which thou shalt lie upon it,
    and thou shalt bear their iniquities.
**5** And I have given unto thee their two iniquities for a number of days,
    one hundred and ninety days, and thou shalt bear the iniquities
    of the house of Israel.
**6** And thou shalt complete all these things, and thou shalt lie down
    upon thy right side, the second, and thou shalt bear the iniquities
    of the house of Judah for forty days; a day for a year have I set for thee.
**7** And for the siege of Jerusalem thou shalt prepare thy face,
    and thou shalt strengthen thine arm, and thou shalt prophesy against it.
**8** And behold, I have laid bonds upon thee, and thou shalt not turn
    from thy side to thy side, until the days of thy siege be completed.
**9** And thou, take unto thyself wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils,
    and millet, and spelt, and thou shalt put them into an earthen vessel;
    and thou shalt make them for thyself into loaves of bread, and
    according to the number of the days which thou shalt lie upon thy side,
    one hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat them.
**10** And thy food, which thou shalt eat, shall be by weight: twenty shekels
    a day shalt thou eat; from [one] time even unto [another] time shalt thou eat them.
**11** And water by measure shalt thou drink: the sixth part of a hin
    from [one] time even unto [another] time shalt thou drink.
**12** And barley cakes shalt thou eat thereof, and with balls of human dung
    shalt thou bake them before their eyes. And thou shalt say, “Thus saith
    the Lord God of Israel: Even so shall the children of Israel eat unclean things
    among the nations, where I shall scatter them there.”
**13** And I said, “By no means, O Lord, Lord God of Israel! If my soul
    hath not been defiled with uncleanness, and I have eaten no carrion
    nor that which was torn of beasts from my birth until now, neither
    hath any flesh of an idol entered into my mouth.”
**14** And the Lord said unto me, “Behold, I have given thee balls of cattle dung
    instead of the human dung, and thou shalt make thy loaves upon them.”
**15** And the Lord said unto me, “Son of man, behold, I do break the staff
    of bread in Jerusalem, and they shall eat bread by weight and in scarcity,
    and they shall drink water by measure and in desolation, that they may become
    destitute of bread and water;
**16** and man and his brother shall be consumed, and they shall suffer evil
    in their iniquities.”
