αὐτὴν ἕως αἰῶνος τῶν αἰώνων. Καὶ ἐζήτουν ἀκριβῶς περὶ τοῦ 19
θηρίου τοῦ τετάρτου, ὅτι ἦν διάφορον παρὰ πᾶν θηρίον, φοβε-
ρὸν περισσῶς, οἱ ὀδόντες αὐτοῦ σιδηροῖ, καὶ οἱ ὄνυχες αὐτοῦ χαλ-
κοῖ, ἐσθίον, καὶ λεπτύνων, καὶ τὰ ἐπίλοιπα τοῖς ποσὶν αὐτοῦ
συνεπάτει. Καὶ περὶ τῶν κεράτων αὐτοῦ τῶν δέκα τῶν ἐν τῇ 20
κεφαλῇ αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοῦ ἑτέρου τοῦ ἀναβάντος καὶ ἐκτινάξαντος
τῶν προτέρων τρία, κέρας ἐκεῖνο, ᾧ οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ καὶ στόμα λα-
λοῦν μεγάλα, καὶ ἡ ὅρασις αὐτοῦ μείζων τῶν λοιπῶν. Ἐθεώ- 21
ρουν, καὶ τὸ κέρας ἐκεῖνο ἐποίει πόλεμον μετὰ τῶν ἁγίων, καὶ
ἴσχυε πρὸς αὐτούς, ἕως οὗ ἦλθεν ὁ παλαιὸς τῶν ἡμερῶν, καὶ 22
τὸ κρίμα ἔδωκεν ἁγίοις ὑψίστου· καὶ ὁ καιρὸς ἔφθασε, καὶ τὴν
βασιλείαν κατέσχον οἱ ἅγιοι· καὶ εἶπε· τὸ θηρίον τὸ τέταρτον, 23
βασιλεία τετάρτη ἔσται ἐν τῇ γῇ, ἥτις ὑπερέξει πάσας τὰς βα-
σιλείας, καὶ καταφάγεται πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν, καὶ συμπατήσει αὐτὴν
καὶ κατακόψει. Καὶ τὰ δέκα κέρατα αὐτοῦ, δέκα βασιλεῖς ἀνα- 24
στήσονται, καὶ ὀπίσω αὐτῶν ἀναστήσεται ἕτερος, ὃς ὑπεροίσει
κακοῖς πάντας τοὺς ἔμπροσθεν, καὶ τρεῖς βασιλεῖς ταπεινώσει,
καὶ λόγους πρὸς τὸν ὕψιστον λαλήσει, καὶ τοὺς ἁγίους ὑψίστου 25
παλαιώσει, καὶ ὑπονοήσει τοῦ ἀλλοιῶσαι καιροὺς καὶ νόμον, καὶ
δοθήσεται ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ ἕως καιροῦ (καὶ καιροῦ) καὶ καιρῶν
καὶ ἡμίσου καιροῦ, καὶ τὸ κριτήριον καθίσει, καὶ τὴν ἀρχὴν με- 26
ταστήσουσι τοῦ ἀφανίσαι, καὶ τοῦ ἀπολέσαι ἕως τέλους, καὶ ἡ 27
βασιλεία καὶ ἡ ἐξουσία καὶ ἡ μεγαλωσύνη τῶν βασιλέων τῶν
ὑποκάτω παντὸς τοῦ οὐρανοῦ (καὶ) ἐδόθη ἁγίοις ὑψίστου· καὶ
ἡ βασιλεία αὐτοῦ, βασιλεία αἰώνιος, καὶ πᾶσαι αἱ ἀρχαὶ αὐτῷ
δουλεύσουσι καὶ ὑπακούσονται. Ἕως ὧδε τὸ πέρας τοῦ λόγου· 28
ἐγὼ Δανιήλ, ἐπὶ πολὺ οἱ διαλογισμοί μου συνετάρασσόν με, καὶ
ἡ μορφή μου ἠλλοιώθη ἐπ᾿ ἐμοί, καὶ τὸ ῥῆμα ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ μου
συνετήρησα.

**18** ...and shall possess it for ever and ever.
**19** Then I sought for to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was diverse from all [other] beasts, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and its claws of bronze; which devoured, and crushed, and the remainder did it trample with its feet.
**20** And concerning its ten horns which were in its head, and of the other which came up and plucked up three of the former; even that horn which had eyes, and a mouth speaking great things, whose appearance was more exceeding than the others'.
**21** I beheld, and that same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;
**22** Until the Ancient of Days came, and He rendered the judgment unto the saints of the Most High; and the time did come, and the saints took possession of the kingdom.
**23** And he said, The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom upon the earth, which shall surpass all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down and break it in pieces.
**24** And its ten horns are ten kings who shall arise, and after them another shall arise, who shall excel in evil all those that came before him, and he shall humble three kings,
**25** and he shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and he shall presume to change times and law: and [power] shall be given into his hand until a time (and a time) and times and half a time.
**26** But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to annihilate and to destroy [it] utterly unto the end.
**27** And the kingdom, and the dominion, and the greatness of the kings beneath all the heaven (and) was given unto the saints of the Most High; and His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve Him and shall obey.
**28** Hitherto is the conclusion of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my cogitations did trouble me greatly, and my countenance was changed upon me; yet I kept the matter in my heart.
