σοῦ· τάδε λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ· ἐὰν ταῖς ὁδοῖς μου πο- 7
ρεύῃ, καὶ ἐν τοῖς προστάγμασί μου φυλάσσῃ, καὶ σὺ διακρινεῖς
τὸν οἶκόν μου· καὶ ἐὰν φυλάξῃς καίγε τὴν αὐλὴν μου, καὶ δώσω
σοι ἀναστρεφομένους ἐν μέσῳ τῶν ἑστηκότων τούτων. ῎Ακουε 8
δὴ Ἰησοῦ ὁ ἱερεὺς ὁ μέγας, σὺ καὶ οἱ πλησίον σου καὶ οἱ καθή-
μενοι πρὸ προσώπου σου, διότι ἄνδρες τερατοσκόποι εἰσί· διότι
ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἄγω τὸν δοῦλόν μου ἀνατολήν· διότι ὁ λίθος ὃν ἔδωκα 9
πρὸ προσώπου Ἰησοῦ, ἐπὶ τὸν λίθον τὸν ἕνα ἑπτὰ ὀφθαλμοί εἰ-
σιν· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ὀρύσσω βόθρον, λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ, καὶ
ψηλαφήσω πᾶσαν τὴν ἀδικίαν τῆς γῆς ἐκείνης ἐν ἡμέρᾳ μιᾷ. Ἐν 10
τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ, συγκαλέσετε ἕκα-
στος τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ ὑποκάτω ἀμπέλου καὶ ὑποκάτω συκῆς.

ΚΕΦ. Δ΄. IV.

ΚΑΙ ἐπέστρεψεν ὁ ἄγγελος ὁ λαλῶν ἐν ἐμοί, καὶ ἐξήγειρέ 1
με, ὃν τρόπον ὅταν ἐξεγερθῇ ἄνθρωπος ἐξ ὕπνου αὐτοῦ· καὶ 2
εἶπε πρός μέ· τί σὺ βλέπεις; Καὶ εἶπα· ἑώρακα, καὶ ἰδοὺ λυ-
χνία χρυσῆ ὅλη, καὶ τὸ λαμπάδιον ἐπάνω αὐτῆς, καὶ ἑπτὰ λύ-
χνοι ἐπάνω αὐτῆς, καὶ ἑπτὰ ἐπαρυστρίδες τοῖς λύχνοις τοῖς ἐπά-
νω αὐτῆς· καὶ δύο ἐλαῖαι ἐπάνω αὐτῆς, μία ἐκ δεξιῶν τοῦ λαμ- 3
παδίου αὐτῆς, καὶ μία ἐξ εὐωνύμων. Καὶ ἐπηρώτησα, καὶ εἶ- 4
πα πρὸς τὸν ἄγγελον τὸν λαλοῦντα ἐν ἐμοί, λέγων· τί ἐστι ταῦ-
τα Κύριε; Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη ὁ ἄγγελος ὁ λαλῶν ἐν ἐμοί, καὶ εἶπε 5
πρός μέ· οὐ γινώσκεις τί ἐστι ταῦτα; Καὶ εἶπα· οὐχί Κύριε.
Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη, καὶ εἶπε πρός μέ, λέγων· οὗτος ὁ λόγος Κυρίου 6
πρὸς Ζοροβάβελ, λέγων· οὐκ ἐν δυνάμει μεγάλῃ, οὐδὲ ἐν ἰσχύϊ,
ἀλλ᾽ ἢ ἐν πνεύματί μου, λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ. Τίς εἶ σὺ 7
τὸ ὄρος τὸ μέγα, τὸ πρὸ προσώπου Ζοροβάβελ τοῦ κατορθῶσαι;
καὶ ἐξοίσω τὸν λίθον τῆς κληρονομίας ἰσότητα χάριτος χάριτα
αὐτῆς. Καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς μέ, λέγων· αἱ χεῖρες 8
Ζοροβάβελ ἐθεμελίωσαν τὸν οἶκον τοῦτον, καὶ αἱ χεῖρες αὐτοῦ 9
ἐπιτελέσουσιν αὐτόν, καὶ ἐπιγνώσῃ, διότι Κύριος παντοκράτωρ
ἐξαπέστειλέ με πρὸς σέ. Διότι τίς ἐξουδένωσεν εἰς ἡμέρας μι- 10
κράς; καὶ χαρήσονται, καὶ ὄψονται τὸν λίθον τὸν κασσιτέρινον
ἐν χειρὶ Ζοροβάβελ. Ἑπτὰ οὗτοι ὀφθαλμοί εἰσιν Κυρίου, οἱ ἐπι-

**Zechariah [Chapter] 3.**

**7** unto thee: Thus saith the Lord Almighty: If thou wilt walk in My ways, and wilt keep My precepts, then shalt thou judge My house; and if thou wilt keep My court, then will I grant thee a place to walk among these that stand by.

**8** Hear now, O Joshua, High Priest, thou, and thy companions that sit before thee; for they are men of portent; for behold, I bring forth My Servant, the Branch.

**9** For the stone which I have set before Joshua—upon that one stone are seven eyes. Behold, I engrave a pit, saith the Lord Almighty, and I shall blot out all the iniquity of that land in one day.

**10** In that day, saith the Lord Almighty, shall ye call every man his neighbor under the vine and under the fig tree.

**Zechariah [Chapter] 4.**

**1** And the angel that spake with me returned, and awakened me, as a man that is awakened from his sleep.

**2** And he said unto me, "What seest thou?" And I answered, "I have seen, and behold, a lampstand all of gold, and its lamp-head upon it, and seven lamps upon it, and seven spouts for the lamps that are upon it;

**3** and two olive trees are upon it, one on the right side of its lamp-head, and one on the left."

**4** So I asked, and said unto the angel that spake with me, saying, "What are these, my Lord?"

**5** Then the angel that spake with me answered and said unto me, "Knowest thou not what these be?" And I said, "Nay, my Lord."

**6** And he answered and spake unto me, saying, "This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel, saying, 'Not by great might, nor by strength, but by My Spirit,' saith the Lord Almighty."

**7** Who art thou, O great mountain, [that standest] before Zerubbabel, to make [the way] straight? For I will bring forth the stone of inheritance, [with] the equity of grace, yea, [even] her grace.

**8** And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,

**9** "The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands shall finish it; and thou shalt know that the Lord Almighty hath sent me unto thee.

**10** For who hath despised the day of small things? For they shall rejoice, and shall see the tin stone in the hand of Zerubbabel. These seven are the eyes of the Lord, which survey..."
