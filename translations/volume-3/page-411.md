ΚΕΦ. ΙΕ΄. ΙΖ΄. ΙΕΖΕΚΙΗΛ
ρεύονται πρὸς ὑμᾶς, καὶ ὄψεσθε τὰς ὁδοὺς αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ ἐπιλυμήματα αὐτῶν, καὶ μεταμεληθήσεσθε ἐπὶ τὰ κακὰ, ἃ ἐπήγαγον
ἐπὶ Ἱερουσαλὴμ, πάντα τὰ κακὰ ἃ ἐπήγαγον ἐπ᾿ αὐτὴν, καὶ παρακαλέσουσιν ὑμᾶς, διότι ὄψεσθε τὰς ὁδοὺς αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ ἐνθυμήματα αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπιγνώσεσθε, διότι οὐ μάτην πεποίηκα
πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησα ἐν αὐτῇ, λέγει Ἀδωναΐ Κύριος.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΕ΄. ΧV.

ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς με, λέγων· υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, τί ἄν 1.2
γένοιτο τὸ ξύλον τῆς ἀμπέλου ἐκ πάντων τῶν ξύλων τῶν κλημάτων
τῶν ὄντων ἐν τοῖς ξύλοις τοῦ δρυμοῦ; Εἰ λήψονται ἐξ αὐτῆς ξύλον 3
τοῦ ποιῆσαι εἰς ἐργασίαν; εἰ λήψονται ἐξ αὐτῆς πάσσαλον τοῦ κρεμᾶσαι ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῦ πᾶν σκεῦος; Πάρεξ ὃ πυρὶ δέδοται εἰς ἀνάλωσιν, 4
τὴν κατ᾿ ἐνιαυτὸν κάθαρσιν αὐτῆς ἀναλίσκει τὸ πῦρ, καὶ ἐκλείπει
εἰς τέλος· μὴ χρήσιμον ἔσται εἰς ἐργασίαν ; Οὐδὲ ἔτι αὐτοῦ ἔντος 5
ὁλοκλήρου οὐκ ἔσται εἰς ἐργασίαν ; μὴ ὅτι ἐὰν καὶ πῦρ αὐτὸ
ἀναλώσῃ εἰς τέλος, εἰ ἔσται ἔτι εἰς ἐργασίαν. Διὰ τοῦτο εἰπὸν, 6
τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναΐ Κύριος· ὃν τρόπον τὸ ξύλον τῆς ἀμπέλου ἐν
τοῖς ξύλοις τοῦ δρυμοῦ, ὃ δέδωκα αὐτὸ τῷ πυρὶ εἰς ἀνάλωσιν,
οὕτως δέδωκα τοὺς κατοικοῦντας ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ δώσω τὸ 7
πρόσωπόν μου ἐπ᾿ αὐτούς· ἐκ τοῦ πυρὸς ἐξελεύσονται, καὶ πῦρ αὐτοὺς καταφάγεται, καὶ ἐπιγνώσονται, ὅτι ἐγὼ Κύριος ἐν τῷ στηρίσαι με τὸ πρόσωπόν μου ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς. Καὶ δώσω τὴν γῆν εἰς ἀφανισμὸν, ἀφ᾿ ὧν παρέπεσον παραπτώματι, λέγει Ἀδωναΐ Κύριος.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΕ΄. ΧVΙ.

ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς με λέγων· υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, 1.2
διαμάρτυραι τῇ Ἱερουσαλὴμ τὰς ἀνομίας αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐρεῖς· τάδε 3
λέγει Ἀδωναΐ Κύριος τῇ Ἱερουσαλήμ· ἡ ῥίζα σου καὶ ἡ γένεσις
σου ἐκ γῆς Χαναάν· ὁ πατήρ σου Ἀμοῤῥαῖος, καὶ ἡ μήτηρ σου Χετταία. Καὶ ἡ γένεσίς σου ἐν ᾗ ἡμέρᾳ ἐτέχθης, οὐκ ἔδησας τοὺς μαστούς σου, καὶ ἐν ὕδατι οὐκ ἐλούσθης (τοῦ Χριστοῦ μου) εἰς σωτηρίαν, οὐδὲ ἁλὶ ἡλίσθης, καὶ σπαργανώθης οὐκ ἐσπαργανώθης, οὐδὲ ἐφείσατο ὁ ὀφθαλμός μου ἐπὶ σοί, τοῦ ποιῆσαι σοι ἐκ πάντων τούτων.

**23** ...unto you, and ye shall see their ways and their corrupt devices, and ye shall repent concerning the evils which I brought upon Jerusalem, all the evils which I brought upon her; and they shall comfort you, because ye shall see their ways and their thoughts, and ye shall know that not in vain have I done all that I have done in her, saith Adonai the Lord.

### Chapter XV.

**1** And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
**2** "Son of man, what might the wood of the vine be, among all the woods of the branches that are in the trees of the forest?
**3** Shall men take wood from it to make [aught] for work? Shall they take a peg from it to hang thereon any vessel?
**4** Beyond that which is given to the fire for consumption, the fire doth consume its annual pruning, and it ceaseth utterly. Shall it be useful for work?
**5** Neither yet, whilst it is whole within itself, shall it be [fit] for work? Yea, if the fire consume it utterly, shall it yet be [fit] for work?"
**6** Therefore say, "Thus saith Adonai the Lord: As is the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given unto the fire for consumption, so have I given those that dwell in Jerusalem.
**7** And I will set My face against them; though they shall come forth from the fire, yet shall the fire consume them, and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I have set My face against them.
**8** And I will make the land a desolation, because of their transgression wherein they have trespassed, saith Adonai the Lord."

### Chapter XVI.

**1** And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
**2** "Son of man, declare unto Jerusalem her abominations,
**3** and thou shalt say, 'Thus saith Adonai the Lord unto Jerusalem: Thy root and thy birth are of the land of Canaan; thy father was an Amorite, and thy mother a Hittite.
**4** And as for thy birth, in the day wherein thou wast born, thy breasts were not bound, nor wast thou washed in water, [even] of My Christ, unto salvation; neither wast thou salted with salt, nor wast thou swaddled, no, thou wast not swaddled.
**5** Neither did My eye have pity upon thee, to do for thee any of these things."
