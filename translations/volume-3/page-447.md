τραυματίαι αὐτοῦ, πάντες ἀπερίτμητοι τραυματίαι ἀπὸ μαχαίρας, οἱ δεδω-
κότες τὸν φόβον αὐτῶν ἐπὶ γῆς ζωῆς. Καὶ οὐκ ἐκοιμήθησαν μετὰ  27
τῶν γιγάντων τῶν πεπτωκότων ἀπ’ αἰῶνος, οἱ κατέβησαν εἰς ᾅ-
δου ἐν ὅπλοις πολεμικοῖς αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔθηκαν τὰς μαχαίρας αὐ-
τῶν ὑπὸ τὰς κεφαλὰς αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐγενήθησαν αἱ ἀνομίαι αὐτῶν
ἐπὶ τῶν ὀστῶν αὐτῶν, ὅτι ἐξεφόβησαν γίγαντας ἐν γῇ ζωῆς αὐτῶν.
Καὶ σὺ ἐν μέσω ἀπεριτμήτων συντριβήσῃ, καὶ κοιμηθήσῃ μετὰ  28
τετραυματισμένων μαχαίρᾳ. Ἐκεῖ Ἐδὼμ καὶ οἱ βασιλεῖς αὐτῆς,  29
καὶ πάντες οἱ ἄρχοντες Ἀσσοῦρ, οἱ δόντες τὴν ἰσχὺν αὐτῶν εἰς
τραῦμα μαχαίρας, αὐτοὶ ἐκοιμήθησαν μετὰ τραυματιῶν μα-
χαίρας, ἐκοιμήθησαν μετὰ καταβαινόντων εἰς βόθρον. Ἐκεῖ  30
πάντες οἱ ἄρχοντες τοῦ βορρᾶ πάντες, αὐτοὶ πάντες στρατη-
γοὶ Ἀσσοῦρ, οἱ καταβαίνοντες τραυματίαι, σὺν τῷ φόβῳ αὐτῶν
καὶ τῇ ἰσχύϊ αὐτῶν αἰσχυνόμενοι, καὶ ἐκοιμήθησαν ἀπερίτμη-
τοι μετὰ τραυματιῶν μαχαίρας, καὶ ἔλαβον τὴν βάσανον αὐτῶν
μετὰ τῶν καταβαινόντων εἰς βόθρον. Ἐκείνους ὄψεται βασι-  31
λεὺς Φαραώ, καὶ παρακληθήσεται ἐπὶ πάσῃ τῇ ἰσχύϊ αὐτῶν·
τραυματίαι μαχαίρᾳ Φαραώ, καὶ πᾶσα ἡ δύναμις αὐτοῦ, λέγει
Κύριος ὁ Θεός. Ὅτι δέδωκα τὸν φόβον αὐτοῦ, ἐπὶ γῆς ζωῆς, καὶ  32
κοιμηθήσεται ἐν μέσω ἀπεριτμήτων μετὰ τραυματιῶν μαχαίρας
Φαραώ, καὶ πᾶν τὸ πλῆθος αὐτοῦ, λέγει Κύριος Κύριος ὁ Θεός.

**Chapter 32**

**22** ...his wounded, all uncircumcised, wounded by the sword, who gave their fear upon the land of the living.
**27** And they lay not with the giants that are fallen from of old, who went down into Hades with their weapons of war, and laid their swords beneath their heads; and their iniquities came to be upon their bones, for they had terrified giants in their land of the living.
**28** And thou, in the midst of the uncircumcised, shalt be shattered, and shalt lie down with them that are wounded by the sword.
**29** There is Edom, and her kings, and all the princes of Asshur, who gave their might unto the wound of the sword: they lay down with those wounded by the sword; they lay down with them that go down into the pit.
**30** There [are] all the princes of the north, all of them; even all the commanders of Asshur, who go down wounded, ashamed in their fear and in their might; and they lay down uncircumcised with those wounded by the sword, and received their torment with them that go down into the pit.
**31** Pharaoh the king shall see them, and he shall be comforted concerning all their might; [even] Pharaoh, wounded by the sword, and all his power, saith the Lord God.
**32** For I have set his terror upon the land of the living; and Pharaoh, and all his multitude, shall lie down in the midst of the uncircumcised, with them that are wounded by the sword, saith the Lord, the Lord God.

**Chapter 33**

**1** And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying:
**2** "Son of man, speak unto the children of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring a sword upon a land, if the people of the land take one man from among them, and set him for their watchman;
**3** And if he see the sword come upon the land, and blow the trumpet, and warn the people;
**4** Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning; if the sword come, and take him away,
**5** His blood shall be upon his own head; because he heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning for his soul, his blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning, he shall have delivered his soul.
**6** But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet to warn the people, and the people take no warning; and the sword come, and take [a person from among them]..."
