ΔΑΝΙΗΛ.
ΚΑΙ ἦν ἀνὴρ οἰκῶν ἐν Βαβυλῶνι, καὶ ὄνομα αὐτῷ Ἰωακείμ. Καὶ ἔλαβε γυναῖκα, ᾗ ὄνομα Σουσάννα, θυγάτηρ Χελκίου, καλὴ σφόδρα, καὶ φοβουμένη τὸν Κύριον. Καὶ οἱ γονεῖς αὐτῆς δίκαιοι, καὶ ἐδίδαξαν τὴν θυγατέρα αὐτῶν κατὰ τὸν νόμον Μωσῆ. Καὶ ἦν Ἰωακεὶμ πλούσιος σφόδρα, καὶ ἦν αὐτῷ παράδεισος γειτνιῶν τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ· καὶ πρὸς αὐτὸν προσήγοντο οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι, διὰ τὸ εἶναι αὐτὸν ἔνδοξότερον πάντων. Καὶ ἀπεδείχθησαν δύο πρεσβύτεροι ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ κριταὶ ἐν τῷ ἐνιαυτῷ ἐκείνῳ, περὶ ὧν ἐλάλησεν ὁ δεσπότης, ὅτι ἐξῆλθεν ἀνομία ἐκ Βαβυλῶνος ἐκ πρεσβυτέρων κριτῶν, οἳ ἐδόκουν κυβερνᾶν τὸν λαόν. Οὗτοι προσεκαρτέρουν ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ Ἰωακεὶμ, καὶ ἤρχοντο πρὸς αὐτοὺς πάντες οἱ κρινόμενοι. Καὶ ἐγένετο, ἡνίκα ἀπέτρεχεν ὁ λαὸς μέσον ἡμέρας, εἰσεπορεύετο Σουσάννα, καὶ περιεπάτει ἐν τῷ παραδείσῳ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς αὐτῆς. Καὶ ἐθεώρουν αὐτὴν οἱ δύο πρεσβύτεροι καθ᾿ ἡμέραν εἰσπορευομένην, καὶ περιπατοῦσαν, καὶ ἐγένοντο ἐν ἐπιθυμίᾳ αὐτῆς, καὶ διέστρεψαν τὸν ἑαυτῶν νοῦν, καὶ ἐξέκλιναν τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτῶν, τοῦ μὴ βλέπειν εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν, μηδὲ μνημονεύειν κριμάτων δικαίων. Καὶ ἦσαν ἀμφότεροι κατανενυγμένοι περὶ αὐτῆς, καὶ οὐκ ἀπήγγειλαν ἀλλήλοις τὴν ὀδύνην αὐτῶν, ὅτι ἠσχύνοντο ἀπαγγεῖλαι τὴν ἐπιθυμίαν αὐτῶν, ὅτι ἤθελον συγγενέσθαι αὐτῇ, καὶ παρετηροῦσαν φιλοτίμως καθ᾿ ἡμέραν ὁρᾶν αὐτήν. Καὶ εἶπαν ἕτερος τῷ ἑτέρῳ· πορευθῶμεν δὴ εἰς οἶκον, ὅτι ὥρα ἀρίστου ἐστί· καὶ ἐξελθόντες διεχωρίσθησαν ἀπ᾿ ἀλλήλων, καὶ ἀνακάμψαντες ἦλθον ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό, καὶ ἀνετάζοντες ἀλλήλους τὴν αἰτίαν, ὡμολόγησαν τὴν ἐπιθυμίαν αὐτῶν· καὶ τότε κοινῇ συντετάξαντο καιρὸν, ὅτε αὐτὴν δυνήσονται εὑρεῖν μόνην. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ παρατηρεῖν αὐτοὺς ἡμέραν εὔθετον, εἰσῆλθέ ποτε καθὼς ἐχθὲς καὶ τρίτης ἡμέρας μετὰ δύο μόνων κορασίων, καὶ ἐπεθύμησε λούσασθαι ἐν τῷ παραδείσῳ, ὅτι καῦμα ἦν. Καὶ οὐκ ἦν οὐδεὶς ἐκεῖ πλὴν οἱ δύο πρεσβύτεροι κεκρυμμένοι, καὶ παρατηροῦντες αὐτήν. Καὶ εἶπε τοῖς κορασίοις αὐτῆς, ἐνέγκατε δὴ

**THE STORY OF SUSANNA**

¹ There was a man dwelling in Babylon, whose name was Joachim.
And he took a wife, whose name was Susanna, the daughter of Hilkiah,
Exceeding fair, and one that feared the Lord.
Her parents also were righteous, and taught their daughter according to the law of Moses.

² Now Joachim was exceeding rich, and had a garden adjoining unto his house;
And unto him resorted the Jews, because he was more honorable than all [others].

³ And there were appointed two elders from among the people [to be] judges in that year,
Concerning whom the Lord had spoken, saying,
"Iniquity is come forth from Babylon, from elder judges,
Who seemed to govern the people."

⁴ These [men] abode continually in the house of Joachim;
And all who had matters to be judged came unto them.

⁵ And it came to pass, when the people departed about noon,
Susanna would go in and walk in the garden of her husband.

⁶ And the two elders saw her daily entering in and walking,
And they were inflamed with lust for her.
And they perverted their own mind, and turned away their eyes
From looking unto heaven, neither did they remember righteous judgments.

⁷ And they were both captivated by her, and would not declare their anguish one to another,
For they were ashamed to make known their desire,
Because they longed to lie with her;
And they diligently watched daily to see her.

⁸ And one said to the other, "Let us now go home, for it is the hour for dinner."
And when they had gone forth, they parted one from another;
And returning, they came again together,
And examining one another concerning the cause, they confessed their lust;
And then together they appointed a time, when they might find her alone.

⁹ And it came to pass, as they watched for a suitable day,
That she went in, as on the day before and the third day,
With only two maidens, and she desired to bathe in the garden,
For it was exceeding hot.

¹⁰ And there was no one there save the two elders,
Who were hidden and watching her.

¹¹ And she said unto her maidens, "Bring me now..."
