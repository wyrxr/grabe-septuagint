**ΨΑΛΜ. ΙΖ´.**
**3** ἐλπιῶ ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν ἐπερασπιστής μου, καὶ κέρας σωτηρίας μου, ἀντιλήπτωρ μου.
**4** Αἰνῶν ἐπικαλέσομαι Κύριον, καὶ ἐκ τῶν ἐχθρῶν μου σωθήσομαι.
**5** Περιέσχον με ὠδῖνες θανάτου, καὶ χείμαῤῥοι ἀνομίας ἐξετάραξάν με· ὠδῖνες ᾅδου περιεκύκλωσάν με, προέφθασάν με παγίδες θανάτου.
**6** Καὶ ἐν τῷ θλίβεσθαί με ἐπεκαλεσάμην τὸν Κύριον, καὶ πρὸς τὸν Θεόν μου ἐκέκραξα· ἤκουσεν ἐκ ναοῦ ἁγίου αὐτοῦ φωνῆς μου, καὶ ἡ κραυγή μου ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ εἰσελεύσεται εἰς τὰ ὦτα αὐτοῦ.
**7** Καὶ ἐσαλεύθη καὶ ἔντρομος ἐγενήθη ἡ γῆ· καὶ τὰ θεμέλια τῶν ὀρέων ἐταράχθησαν καὶ ἐσαλεύθησαν, ὅτι ὠργίσθη αὐτοῖς (ὁ Θεός).
**8** Ἀνέβη καπνὸς ἐν ὀργῇ αὐτοῦ, καὶ πῦρ ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ κατεφλόγισεν· ἄνθρακες ἀνήφθησαν ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ.
**9** Καὶ ἔκλινεν οὐρανόν, καὶ κατέβη· καὶ γνόφος ὑπὸ τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ.
**10** Καὶ ἐπέβη ἐπὶ Χερουβείμ, καὶ ἐπετάσθη· ἐπετάσθη ἐπὶ πτερύγων ἀνέμων.
**11** Καὶ ἔθετο σκότος ἀποκρυφὴν αὐτοῦ· κύκλῳ αὐτοῦ ἡ σκηνὴ αὐτοῦ σκοτεινὸν ὕδωρ ἐν νεφέλαις ἀέρων.
**12** Ἀπὸ τῆς τηλαυγήσεως ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ αἱ νεφέλαι διῆλθον· χάλαζα καὶ ἄνθρακες πυρός.
**13** Καὶ ἐβρόντησεν ἐξ οὐρανοῦ ὁ Κύριος, καὶ ὁ ὕψιστος ἔδωκε φωνὴν αὐτοῦ· χάλαζα καὶ ἄνθρακες πυρός.
**14** Καὶ ἐξαπέστειλε βέλη αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐσκόρπισεν αὐτούς· καὶ ἀστραπὰς ἐπλήθυνε, καὶ συνετάραξεν αὐτούς.
**15** Καὶ ὤφθησαν αἱ πηγαὶ τῶν ὑδάτων, καὶ ἀνεκαλύφθησαν τὰ θεμέλια τῆς οἰκουμένης, ἀπὸ ἐπιτιμήσεώς σου Κύριε, ἀπὸ ἐμπνεύσεως πνεύματος ὀργῆς σου.
**16** Ἐξαπέστειλεν ἐξ ὕψους, καὶ ἔλαβέ με· προσελάβετό με ἐξ ὑδάτων πολλῶν.
**17** Ῥύσεταί με ἐξ ἐχθρῶν μου δυνατῶν, καὶ ἐκ τῶν μισούντων με· ὅτι ἐστερεώθησαν ὑπὲρ ἐμέ.
**18** Προέφθασάν με ἐν ἡμέρᾳ κακώσεώς μου· καὶ ἐγένετο Κύριος ἀντιστήριγμά μου.
**19** Καὶ ἐξήγαγέ με εἰς πλατυσμόν· ῥύσεταί με, ὅτι ἠθέλησέ με.
**20** Καὶ ἀνταποδώσει μοι Κύριος κατὰ τὴν δικαιοσύνην μου, καὶ κατὰ τὴν καθαριότητα τῶν χειρῶν μου ἀνταποδώσει μοι·
**21** ὅτι ἐφύλαξα τὰς ὁδοὺς Κυρίου, καὶ οὐκ ἠσέβησα ἀπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ μου·
**22** Ὅτι πάντα τὰ κρίματα αὐτοῦ ἐνώπιόν μου, καὶ τὰ δικαιώματα αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἀπέστησα ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ·
**23** καὶ ἔσομαι ἄμωμος μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ φυλάξομαι ἀπὸ τῆς ἀνομίας μου.
**24** Καὶ ἀνταποδώσει μοι Κύριος κατὰ τὴν δικαιοσύνην μου, καὶ κατὰ τὴν καθαριότητα τῶν χειρῶν μου ἀνταποδώσει μοι ἐνώπιον τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν αὐτοῦ.
**25** Μετὰ ὁσίου ὁσιωθήσῃ, καὶ μετὰ ἀνδρὸς ἀθώου ἀθῶος ἔσῃ, καὶ μετὰ ἐκλεκτοῦ ἐκλεκτὸς ἔσῃ, καὶ μετὰ στρεβλοῦ διαστρέψεις.
**26** Ὅτι σὺ λαὸν

## PSALM XVII.

**3** —will I hope in Him; my defender, and the horn of my salvation, my helper.
**4** With praise will I call upon the Lord, and from mine enemies shall I be delivered.
**5** The pangs of death compassed me, and the torrents of iniquity troubled me; the pangs of Hades surrounded me, the snares of death confronted me.
**6** And in my tribulation I called upon the Lord, and cried out unto my God; He heard my voice from His holy temple, and my cry came before Him, even into His ears.
**7** Then the earth shook and trembled, and the foundations of the mountains were troubled and moved, because [God] was wroth with them.
**8** Smoke ascended in His wrath, and fire from His face devoured; coals were kindled by it.
**9** And He bowed the heavens, and came down; and thick darkness was under His feet.
**10** And He rode upon the Cherubim, and did fly; yea, He did fly upon the wings of the winds.
**11** And He made darkness His secret place; His pavilion round about Him was dark water in the clouds of the skies.
**12** From the brightness before Him His clouds passed through: hail and coals of fire.
**13** And the Lord thundered from heaven, and the Most High gave forth His voice; hail and coals of fire.
**14** And He sent forth His arrows, and scattered them; and He multiplied lightnings, and troubled them.
**15** And the springs of the waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were uncovered, at Thy rebuke, O Lord, at the blast of the breath of Thy wrath.
**16** He sent from above, and took me; He drew me out of many waters.
**17** He will deliver me from my strong enemies, and from them that hate me; for they were made strong beyond me.
**18** They confronted me in the day of my trouble; but the Lord became my support.
**19** And He brought me forth into a broad place; He will deliver me, because He desired me.
**20** And the Lord will recompense me according to my righteousness, and according to the cleanness of my hands will He recompense me.
**21** Because I have kept the ways of the Lord, and have not acted impiously against my God.
**22** For all His judgments were before me, and His ordinances I did not put away from me.
**23** And I shall be blameless with Him, and I shall keep myself from mine iniquity.
**24** And the Lord will recompense me according to my righteousness, and according to the cleanness of my hands He will recompense me before His eyes.
**25** With the holy, Thou wilt show Thyself holy; and with an innocent man, Thou wilt show Thyself innocent; and with the elect, Thou wilt show Thyself elect; and with the crooked, Thou wilt deal perversely.
**26** For Thou wilt save a people...
