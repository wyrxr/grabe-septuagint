**ΨΑΛΤΗΡΙΟΝ. ΥΜΝ. Γ´. III.**

**ΠΡΟΣΕΥΧΗ Ἄννας μητρὸς Σαμουήλ.**

**1** Ἐστερεώθη ἡ καρδία μου ἐν Κυρίῳ, ὑψώθη κέρας μου ἐν Θεῷ μου· ἐπλατύνθη ἐπ᾿ ἐχθρούς μου τὸ στόμα μου, ὅτι ηὐφράνθην ἐν σωτηρίᾳ σου.
**2** (Ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν ἅγιος ὡς Κύριος, καὶ οὐκ ἔστι δίκαιος ὡς ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν· καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν (ἅγιος) πλὴν σου.
**3** Μὴ καυχᾶσθε, καὶ μὴ λαλεῖτε ὑψηλὰ εἰς ὑπεροχήν, μηδὲ ἐξελθάτω μεγαλορρημοσύνη ἐκ τοῦ στόματος ὑμῶν· ὅτι Θεὸς γνώσεων Κύριος, καὶ Θεὸς ἑτοιμάζων ἐπιτηδεύματα αὐτοῦ.
**4** Τόξον δυνατῶν ἠσθένησε, καὶ ἀσθενοῦντες περιεζώσαντο δύναμιν.
**5** Πλήρεις ἄρτων ἠλαττώθησαν, καὶ οἱ πεινῶντες παρῆκαν γῆν. Ὅτι στείρα ἔτεκεν ἑπτά, καὶ ἡ πολλὴ ἐν τέκνοις ἠσθένησε.
**6** Κύριος θανατοῖ καὶ ζωογονεῖ· κατάγει εἰς ᾅδου καὶ ἀνάγει.
**7** Κύριος πτωχίζει καὶ πλουτίζει· ταπεινοῖ καὶ ἀνυψοῖ.
**8** Ἀνιστᾷ ἀπὸ γῆς πένητα, καὶ ἀπὸ κοπρίας ἐγείρει πτωχόν, τοῦ καθίσαι αὐτὸν μετὰ δυναστῶν λαοῦ, καὶ θρόνον δόξης κατακληρονομῶν αὐτοῖς.
**9** Διδοὺς εὐχὴν τῷ εὐχομένῳ, καὶ εὐλόγησεν ἔτη δικαίων· ὅτι οὐκ ἐν ἰσχύϊ δυνατὸς ἀνήρ.
**10** Κύριος ἀσθενῆ ποιήσει τὸν ἀντίδικον αὐτοῦ· Κύριος ἅγιος. Μὴ καυχάσθω ὁ σοφὸς ἐν τῇ σοφίᾳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ μὴ καυχάσθω ὁ δυνατὸς ἐν τῇ δυνάμει αὐτοῦ, καὶ μὴ καυχάσθω ὁ πλούσιος ἐν τῷ πλούτῳ αὐτοῦ· ἀλλ᾿ ἢ ἐν τούτῳ καυχάσθω ὁ καυχώμενος, συνιέναι καὶ γινώσκειν τὸν Κύριον, καὶ ποιεῖν κρίμα καὶ δικαιοσύνην ἐν μέσῳ τῆς γῆς. Κύριος ἀνέβη εἰς οὐρανούς, καὶ ἐβρόντησεν· αὐτὸς κρινεῖ ἄκρα γῆς, δίκαιος ὢν καὶ **δίδωσι** ἰσχὺν τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν ἡμῶν, καὶ ὑψώσει κέρας χριστοῦ αὐτοῦ.

**ΥΜΝ. Δ´. IV.**

**ΠΡΟΣΕΥΧΗ Ἡσαΐου.**

**9** Ἐκ νυκτὸς ὀρθρίζει τὸ πνεῦμά μου πρὸς σὲ ὁ Θεός· διότι φῶς τὰ προστάγματά σου ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς.
**10** Δικαιοσύνην μάθετε οἱ ἐνοικοῦντες ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς· πέπαυται γὰρ ὁ ἀσεβής, οὐ μὴ μάθῃ δικαιοσύνην ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, ἀλήθειαν οὐ μὴ ποιήσει· ἀρθήτω ὁ ἀσεβής, ἵνα μὴ ἴδῃ τὴν δόξαν Κυρίου.
**11** Κύριε ὑψηλὸς σου ὁ βραχίων, καὶ οὐκ ᾔδεισαν· γνόντες δὲ αἰσχυνθήσονται. Ζῆλος λήψεται λαὸν ἀπαίδευτον· καὶ νῦν πῦρ τοὺς ὑπεναντίους **ἔδεται**.

*   **Correction Note:** In verse 10 of the Third Ode, "διδώσιν" was corrected to "δίδωσι" to ensure grammatical agreement between the singular subject "αὐτὸς" (He) and the verb. In verse 11 of the Fourth Ode, "ἔδεται" was added from the subsequent page's context to complete the sentence.

**The Third Ode: The Prayer of Hannah, the Mother of Samuel.**

**1** My heart is made strong in the Lord;
    My horn is exalted in my God.
    My mouth is opened wide over mine enemies,
    For I have rejoiced in Thy salvation.
**2** For there is none holy as the Lord,
    And there is none righteous as our God;
    And there is none [holy] beside Thee.
**3** Boast not, neither speak ye lofty things in arrogance,
    Nor let boasting come forth from your mouth.
    For the Lord is a God of knowledge,
    And a God Who prepareth His own doings.
**4** The bow of the mighty hath been broken,
    And they that were weak have girt themselves with strength.
**5** They that were full of bread have been diminished,
    And the hungry have ceased [from the earth].
    For the barren woman hath borne seven,
    And she that had many children hath grown weak.
**6** The Lord killeth and maketh alive;
    He bringeth down to Hades and bringeth up.
**7** The Lord maketh poor and maketh rich;
    He humbleth and lifteth up.
**8** He raiseth up the poor from the earth,
    And from the dung heap He lifteth up the needy,
    To make him sit with the mighty ones of the people,
    And bequeathing unto them a throne of glory.
**9** Granting prayer to him that prayeth,
    And He hath blessed the years of the righteous.
    For a man is not mighty by [his own] strength.
**10** The Lord shall make His adversary weak;
    The Lord is holy.
    Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom,
    And let not the mighty man boast in his might,
    And let not the rich man boast in his riches;
    But let him that boasteth, boast in this:
    To understand and to know the Lord,
    And to do judgment and righteousness in the midst of the earth.
    The Lord hath ascended into the heavens, and hath thundered.
    He Himself shall judge the ends of the earth,
    Being righteous, and He giveth strength unto our kings,
    And He shall exalt the horn of His Anointed One.

**The Fourth Ode: The Prayer of Isaiah.**

**9** From the night my spirit riseth early unto Thee, O God;
    For Thy commandments are light upon the earth.
**10** Learn righteousness, ye that dwell upon the earth.
    For the ungodly is ceased,
    He shall not learn righteousness upon the earth,
    Truth he shall not do.
    Let the ungodly be taken away,
    Lest he see the glory of the Lord.
**11** O Lord, high is Thine arm, and they knew it not;
    But when they know, they shall be put to shame.
    Zeal shall take hold of an uninstructed people;
    And now shall fire devour the adversaries.
