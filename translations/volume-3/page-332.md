ΚΕΦ. ΛΔʹ. ΙΕΡΕΜΙΑΣ
2 ἠσχύνθη Ἀμὰβ τὸ κραταίωμα, καὶ ἡττήθη. Καὶ γὰρ οὐκ ἔστιν
ἔτι ἰατρεία ἐν Μωάβ, ἀγαύριαμα ἐν Ἑσεβών, ἐλογίσατο ἐπ᾿ αὐτὴν
κακά· δεῦτε καὶ ἐκκόψωμεν αὐτὴν ἀπὸ ἔθνους, καὶ παῦσιν παύσεται·
ὄπισθέν σου βαδιεῖται μάχαιρα, ὅτι φωνὴ κεκραγότων
4 ἐξ Ὠρωναΐμ, ὄλεθρος καὶ σύντριμμα μέγα. Συνετρίβη Μωάβ,
5 ἀναγγείλατε εἰς Ζογόρα, ὅτι ἐπλήσθη Ἀλαὼθ ἐν κλαυθμῷ· ἀναβήσεται
κλαίων ἐν ὁδῷ Ὠρωναΐμ, οἱ ἐχθροὶ κραυγὴν συντρίμματος
ἠκούσατε, φεύγετε καὶ σώσατε τὰς ψυχὰς ὑμῶν, καὶ ἔσεσθε
7 ὥσπερ ὄνος ἄγριος ἐν ἐρήμῳ, ἐπειδὴ ἐπεποίθεις ἐν ὀχυρώμασί σου,
ἥξουσί σοι θλίψεις, καί γε σὺ συλληφθήσῃ· καὶ ἐξελεύσεται
Χαμὼς ἐν ἀποικίᾳ, καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς αὐτοῦ, καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες αὐτοῦ
8 ἅμα. Καὶ ἥξει ὄλεθρος ἐπὶ πᾶσαν πόλιν, καὶ πόλις οὐ μὴ σωθῇ,
καὶ ἀπολεῖται ὁ αὐλών, καὶ ἐξολοθρευθήσεται ἡ πεδινή,
9 καθὼς εἶπε Κύριος. Δότε σημεῖον τῇ Μωάβ, ὅτι ἀφὴ ἀναφθήσεται,
καὶ πᾶσαι αἱ πόλεις αὐτῆς εἰς ἀβατον ἔσονται ἀπὸ ἐνοικούντων
10 αὐτάς. Ἐπικατάρατος ὁ ποιῶν τὰ ἔργα Κυρίου ἀμελῶς,
καὶ ἐπικατάρατος ἐξαίρων μάχαιραν αὐτοῦ ἀφ᾿ αἵματος.
11 Ἀνεπαύσατο Μωὰβ ἐκ παιδαρίου, καὶ πεποιθὼς ἦν ἐπὶ τῇ δόξῃ αὐτοῦ,
οὐκ ἐνέχεεν ἐξ ἀγγείου εἰς ἀγγεῖον, καὶ εἰς ἀποικισμὸν οὐκ ᾤχετο·
διὰ τοῦτο ἔστη γεῦμα αὐτοῦ ἐν αὐτῷ, καὶ ὀσμὴ αὐτοῦ οὐκ
12 ἐκλείπει. Διὰ τοῦτο ἰδοὺ ἡμέραι ἔρχονται, φησὶ Κύριος, καὶ
ἀποστελῶ αὐτῷ κλίνοντας, καὶ κλινοῦσιν αὐτόν, καὶ τὰ σκεύη
13 αὐτοῦ λεπτυνοῦσι, καὶ τὰ κέρατα αὐτοῦ συγκούσουσι, καὶ καταισχυνθήσεται
Μωὰβ ἀπὸ Χαμὼς, ὥσπερ κατησχύνθη ὁ οἶκος
14 Ἰσραὴλ ἀπὸ Βαιθὴλ ἐλπίδος αὐτῶν πεποιθότες ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῖς. Πῶς
ἐρεῖτε, ἰσχυροὶ ἐσμεν, καὶ ἄνθρωπος ἰσχύων εἰς τὰ πολεμικά;
15 Ὤλετο Μωὰβ πόλις αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐκλεκτοὶ νεανίσκοι αὐτοῦ κατέβησαν
εἰς σφαγήν, φησὶν ὁ βασιλεύς, Κύριος τῶν δυνάμεων
16 ὄνομα αὐτῷ. Ἐγγὺς ἡμέρα Μωὰβ ἐλθεῖν, καὶ πονηρία αὐτοῦ
17 ταχεῖα σφόδρα. Κινήσατε αὐτῷ πάντες κυκλόθεν αὐτοῦ, πάντες
ἔκδοτε ὄνομα αὐτοῦ· εἴπατε, πῶς συνετρίβη βακτηρία εὐκλεής,
18 ῥάβδος μεγαλώματος; Κατάβηθι ἀπὸ δόξης, καὶ κάθισον ἐν
ὑγρασίᾳ καθημένη, θυγάτηρ Δαιβών, ἐκτρίβετε, ὅτι ὤλετο
19 Μωάβ, ἀνέβη εἰς σὲ λυμαινόμενος ὀχυρώματά σου. Ἐφ᾿ ὁδοῦ
στῆθι, καὶ ἔπιδε καθημένη ἐν Ἀροήρ, καὶ ἐρώτησον φεύγοντα,
20 καὶ σωζόμενον, καὶ εἰπόν, τί ἐγένετο; Κατησχύνθη Μωάβ, ὅτι

**Jeremiah, Chapter 34**
(Also numbered Chapter 31; Corresponding to Hebrew Chapter 48)

**2** Amab is put to shame, [even] its strength, and it is vanquished. For there is no more
healing in Moab, [nor any] pride in Heshbon, [for the Lord] hath purposed
evils against her. Come ye, and let us cut her off from [among] the nations;
and she shall utterly cease. Behind thee shall a sword walk, because of the voice
of them that cry out
**4** from Horonaim, [for] destruction and a great shattering [shall come]. Moab is broken.
**5** Declare ye in Zoar, that Aloath is filled with weeping. He shall go up
weeping in the way of Horonaim. The enemies—a cry of crushing—have ye heard;
flee ye, and save your souls; and ye shall be
**7** as a wild ass in the wilderness, because thou didst trust in thy strongholds.
Tribulations shall come upon thee, and thou shalt indeed be captured. And Chemosh
shall go forth into exile, with his priests and his princes,
**8** all together. And destruction shall come upon every city, and no city shall be saved,
and the valley shall perish, and the plain shall be utterly destroyed,
**9** as the Lord hath spoken. Give a sign unto Moab, for a kindling shall be kindled,
and all her cities shall be desolate, impassable by those dwelling
**10** within them. Cursed be he that doeth the work of the Lord negligently,
and cursed be he that withholdeth his sword from blood.
**11** Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath trusted in his glory.
He hath not been poured from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into exile.
Therefore his taste remaineth in him, and his scent doth not
**12** fail. Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will send
unto him [those who] pour [out], and they shall pour him [out], and his vessels
**13** shall they empty, and his horns shall they break off. And Moab shall be put to
shame on account of Chemosh, even as the house of
**14** Israel was ashamed of Bethel, their hope, [on which] they trusted. How
will ye say, 'We are strong, and men mighty in war'?
**15** Moab is destroyed, his cities; and his chosen young men are gone down
to slaughter, saith the King, whose Name is the Lord of hosts.
**16** Nigh is the day for Moab to come, and his wickedness [is]
**17** exceeding swift. Stir yourselves up against him, all ye round about him; all ye,
declare his name. Say ye, 'How is the glorious staff broken,
**18** the rod of majesty?' Come down from glory, and sit in [a place of]
dampness, O daughter of Dibon, thou that dwellest [there]; waste ye [away], for Moab is destroyed,
**19** he that destroyeth thy strongholds is gone up against thee. Stand by the way,
and look, O thou that dwellest in Aroer, and ask him that fleeth,
**20** and him that escapeth; and say, 'What hath come to pass?' Moab is put to shame, for he is broken.
