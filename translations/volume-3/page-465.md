ΚΕΦ. Μ΄. ΜΑ΄. ΙΕΖΕΚΙΗΛ 1403
τοῖς φυλάσσουσι τὴν φυλακὴν τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου· ἐκεῖνοι εἰσιν οἱ 46
υἱοὶ Σαδδούχ, οἱ ἐγγίζοντες ἐκ τοῦ Λευὶ πρὸς Κύριον, λειτουργεῖν αὐτῷ.
Καὶ διεμέτρησε τὴν αὐλὴν μῆκος πήχεων ἑκατόν, 47
καὶ εὖρος πήχεων ἑκατόν, ἐπὶ τὰ τέσσαρα μέρη αὐτῆς, καὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον ἀπέναντι τοῦ οἴκου.
Καὶ εἰσήγαγέ με εἰς τὸ Αἰλὰμ τοῦ οἴκου· 48
καὶ διεμέτρησε τὸ Αἰλ τοῦ Αἰλὰμ πήχεων πέντε τὸ πλάτος ἔνθεν, καὶ πήχεων πέντε ἔνθεν, καὶ τὸ εὖρος τοῦ θυρώματος πήχεων δεκατεσσάρων, καὶ ἐπωμίδες τῆς θύρας τοῦ Αἰλὰμ πήχεων τριῶν ἔνθεν, καὶ πήχεων τριῶν ἔνθεν.
Καὶ τὸ μῆκος τοῦ Αἰλὰμ πήχεις εἴκοσι, 49
καὶ τὸ εὖρος πήχεις δώδεκα· καὶ ἐπὶ δέκα ἀναβαθμῶν ἀνέβαινον ἐπ᾽ αὐτό, καὶ στύλοι ἦσαν ἐπὶ τὸ Αἰλάμ, εἷς ἔνθεν καὶ εἷς ἔνθεν.

ΚΕΦ. ΜΑ΄. XLI.

ΚΑΙ εἰσήγαγέ με εἰς τὸν ναόν, 1
καὶ διεμέτρησε τὸ Αἰλὰμ πήχεις ἓξ τὸ πλάτος ἔνθεν, καὶ πήχεις ἓξ τὸ εὖρος τοῦ Αἰλὰμ ἔνθεν, 2
καὶ τὸ εὖρος τοῦ πυλῶνος πήχεων δέκα, καὶ ἐπωμίδες τοῦ πυλῶνος πήχεων πέντε ἔνθεν, καὶ πήχεων πέντε ἔνθεν· καὶ διεμέτρησε τὸ μῆκος αὐτοῦ πήχεις τεσσαράκοντα, καὶ εὖρος πήχεις εἴκοσι.
Καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὴν αὐλὴν τὴν ἐσωτέραν, 3
καὶ διεμέτρησε τὸ Αἰλ τοῦ θυρώματος πήχεις δύο, καὶ τὸ θύρωμα πήχεις ἕξ, καὶ τὰς ἐπωμίδας τοῦ θυρώματος πήχεις ἑπτὰ ἔνθεν, καὶ πήχεις ἑπτὰ ἔνθεν.
Καὶ διεμέτρησε τὸ μῆκος τῶν θυρωμάτων 4
πήχεις τεσσαράκοντα, καὶ εὖρος πήχεις εἴκοσι, κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ ναοῦ· καὶ εἶπε πρὸς μέ· τοῦτο τὸ ἅγιον τῶν ἁγίων.
Καὶ διεμέτρησε τὸν τοῖχον τοῦ οἴκου πήχεις ἕξ, 5
καὶ τὸ εὖρος τῆς πλευρᾶς πήχεις τέσσαρες κυκλόθεν, καὶ τὰ πλευρὰ πλευρὸν ἐπὶ πλευρὸν τριάκοντα καὶ τρὶς δίς·
καὶ διάστημα ἐν τῷ τοίχῳ τοῦ 6
οἴκου ἐν τοῖς πλευροῖς τοῦ οἴκου κύκλῳ, τοῦ εἶναι τοῖς ἐπιλαμβανομένοις ὁρᾷν, ὅπως τὸ παράπαν μὴ ἅπτωνται τῶν τοίχων τοῦ οἴκου.
Καὶ τὸ εὖρος τῆς ἀνωτέρας τῶν πλευρῶν κατὰ τὸ 7
πρόθεμα ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου, πρὸς τὴν ἀνωτέραν κύκλῳ τοῦ οἴκου, ὅπως διαπλατύνωνται ἄνωθεν, καὶ ἐκ τῶν κάτωθεν ἀναβαίνωσιν ἐπὶ τὰ ὑπερῶα, καὶ ἐκ τῶν μέσων ἐπὶ τὰ τριώροφα,
καὶ τὸ θραεῖλ τοῦ 8
οἴκου ὕψος κύκλῳ διάστημα τῶν πλευρῶν ἴσον τῷ καλάμῳ πήχεων ἕξ· διαστήματα.
καὶ εὖρος τοῦ τοίχου τῆς πλευρᾶς ἔξωθεν πήχεων 9

**Ezekiel 40**
46 who keep the charge of the altar; these are the sons of Zadok, who draw nigh from [the tribe of] Levi unto the Lord, to minister unto Him.
47 And he measured the court, a hundred cubits in length, and a hundred cubits in breadth, on its four parts; and the altar was over against the house.
48 And he brought me into the Ailam of the house; and he measured the Ail of the Ailam, five cubits wide on this side, and five cubits on that side; and the breadth of the gatehouse [was] fourteen cubits, and the doorposts of the door of the Ailam [were] three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.
49 And the length of the Ailam [was] twenty cubits, and its breadth twelve cubits; and by ten steps did they go up unto it; and pillars were upon the Ailam, one on this side, and one on that side.

**Ezekiel 41**
1 And he brought me into the temple; and he measured the Ailam, six cubits in breadth on this side, and six cubits the breadth of the Ailam on that side.
2 And the breadth of the gateway [was] ten cubits; and the doorposts of the gateway [were] five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side; and he measured its length forty cubits, and its breadth twenty cubits.
3 And he entered into the inner court; and he measured the Ail of the doorway, two cubits; and the doorway [was] six cubits; and the doorposts of the doorway [were] seven cubits on this side, and seven cubits on that side.
4 And he measured the length of the doorways forty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits, before the temple; and he said unto me, "This [is] the Holy of Holies."
5 And he measured the wall of the house, six cubits [thick]; and the breadth of the side-chamber, four cubits, all round about; and the side-chambers, side upon side, thirty and three twice [in number].
6 And a space within the wall of the house, in the side-chambers of the house round about, that it might be for those that took hold [thereof] to discern, lest they should by any means touch the walls of the house.
7 And the breadth of the upper [story] of the side-chambers, according to the projection from the house, toward the uppermost [part] round about the house, that they might be broadened above; and from the lowest [chambers] they might go up unto the upper rooms, and from the middle [chambers] unto the third story.
8 And the Thrael of the house, its height round about, [was] a space for the side-chambers, equal unto a reed of six cubits: such were the spaces.
9 And the breadth of the wall of the side-chamber on the outside [was] five cubits.
