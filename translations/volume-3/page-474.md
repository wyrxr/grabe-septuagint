ΙΕΖΕΚΙΗΛ ΚΕΦ. ΜΕ΄.
⁷ χὰς τῶν ἁγίων, εἰς κατάσχεσιν τῆς πόλεως, κατὰ πρόσωπον τῶν ἀπαρχῶν τῶν ἁγίων, καὶ κατὰ πρόσωπον τῆς κατασχέσεως τῆς πόλεως τὰ πρὸς θάλασσαν, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν πρὸς θάλασσαν τὰ πρὸς ἀνατολάς· καὶ τὸ μῆκος ὡς μία τῶν μερίδων ἀπὸ τῶν ὁρίων τῶν πρὸς θάλασσαν· καὶ τὸ μῆκος ἐπὶ τὰ ὅρια τὰ πρὸς ἀνατολὰς τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἔσται αὐτῷ εἰς κατάσχεσιν ἐν τῷ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ οὐ καταδυναστεύσουσιν οὐκέτι οἱ ἀφηγούμενοι τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ τὸν λαόν μου, καὶ τὴν γῆν κατακληρονομήσουσιν οἶκος Ἰσραὴλ κατὰ φυλὰς αὐτῶν.
⁸ Τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεός· ἱκανούσθω ὑμῖν, οἱ ἀφηγούμενοι τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, ἀδικίαν καὶ ταλαιπωρίαν ἀφέλεσθε, καὶ κρίμα καὶ δικαιοσύνην ποιήσατε· καὶ ἐξάρατε καταδυναστείαν ἀπὸ
⁹ τοῦ λαοῦ μου, λέγει Κύριος Θεός. Ζυγὸς δίκαιος, καὶ μέτρον δίκαιον, καὶ χοῖνιξ δικαία ἔσται ὑμῖν τοῦ μέτρου, καὶ ἡ χοῖνιξ ὁμοίως μία ἔσται τοῦ λαμβάνειν· τὸ δέκατον τοῦ γομόρ, ἡ χοῖνιξ· καὶ τὸ δέκατον τοῦ γομόρ, τὸ μέτρον πρὸς τὸ γομόρ ἔσται ἴσον.
¹⁰ Καὶ τὰ στάθμια εἴκοσι ὀβολοί, οἱ πέντε σίκλοι, πέντε καὶ οἱ δέκα σίκλοι, δέκα καὶ πεντήκοντα σίκλοι ἡ μνᾶ ἔσται ὑμῖν.
¹¹ Καὶ αὕτη ἡ ἀπαρχή, ἣν ἀφοριεῖτε, ἕκτον τοῦ μέτρου ἀπὸ τοῦ γομόρ τοῦ πυροῦ, καὶ τὸ ἕκτον τοῦ οἴφι ἀπὸ τοῦ γομόρ κόρου τῶν κριθῶν.
¹² Καὶ τὸ πρόσταγμα τοῦ ἐλαίου κοτύλην ἐλαίου ἀπὸ τῶν δέκα κοτυλῶν, ἔτι αἱ δέκα κοτύλαι εἰσὶ γομόρ. Καὶ πρόβατον ἓν ἀπὸ τῶν δέκα προβάτων ἀφαίρεμα ἐκ πασῶν τῶν πατριῶν τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, εἰς θυσίας καὶ εἰς ὁλοκαυτώματα καὶ εἰς σωτήριον τοῦ ἐξιλάσασθαι περὶ ὑμῶν, λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεός.
¹³ Καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς δώσει τὴν ἀπαρχὴν ταύτην τῷ ἀφηγουμένῳ τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ διὰ τοῦ ἀφηγουμένου ἔσται τὰ ὁλοκαυτώματα· καὶ αἱ θυσίαι καὶ αἱ σπονδαὶ ἔσονται ἐν ταῖς ἑορταῖς, καὶ ἐν ταῖς νουμηνίαις, καὶ ἐν τοῖς σαββάτοις, καὶ ἐν πάσαις ταῖς ἑορταῖς οἴκου Ἰσραήλ· αὐτὸς ποιήσει τὰ ὑπὲρ ἁμαρτίας, καὶ τὴν θυσίαν, καὶ τὰ ὁλοκαυτώματα, καὶ τὰ τοῦ σωτηρίου, τοῦ ἐξιλάσκεσθαι ὑπὲρ τοῦ οἴκου Ἰσραήλ.
¹⁴ Τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεός· ἐν τῷ πρώτῳ μηνὶ μιᾷ τοῦ μηνός, λήψεσθε μόσχον ἐκ βοῶν ἄμωμον, τοῦ ἐξιλάσασθαι τὸ ἅγιον.
¹⁵ Καὶ λήψεται ὁ ἱερεὺς ἀπὸ τοῦ αἵματος τοῦ μόσχου τοῦ ἐξιλασμοῦ, καὶ δώσει ἐπὶ τὰς φλιὰς τοῦ οἴκου, καὶ τὰς τέσσαρας γωνίας τοῦ ἱεροῦ, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς φλιὰς τῆς πύλης τῆς αὐλῆς τῆς ἐσωτέρας.
¹⁶ Καὶ οὕτως ποιήσεις ἐν τῷ μηνὶ τῷ ἑβδόμῳ·

**Chapter 45**

⁷ ...[unto] the firstfruits of the holy [portions], for the possession of the city, before the firstfruits of the holy [portions], and before the possession of the city toward the sea, and from those toward the sea to those toward the east; and the length shall be as one of the portions from the borders toward the sea, and the length shall extend unto the borders toward the east of the land; and it shall be for him a possession in Israel, and no longer shall the rulers of Israel oppress My people, but the house of Israel shall inherit the land according to their tribes.
⁸ Thus saith the Lord God: Let it suffice you, O rulers of Israel; remove all injustice and oppression, and execute judgment and righteousness; and take away your oppressions from My people,
⁹ saith the Lord God. A just balance, and a just measure, and a just choinix shall be yours for the measure; and the choinix shall likewise be one for receiving. The choinix [shall be] the tenth part of a gomer; and the tenth part of a gomer, the measure for the gomer, shall be [truly] equal.
¹⁰ And for the weights: twenty obols; the five shekels, five; and the ten shekels, ten. And fifty shekels shall be your mina.
¹¹ And this [shall be] the heave-offering that ye shall set apart: the sixth part of the measure from the gomer of wheat, and the sixth part of the ephah from the gomer kor of barley.
¹² And the ordinance for the oil: a cotyle of oil from ten cotyles; yet the ten cotyles are a gomer. And one sheep from ten sheep [shall be] a heave-offering from all the families of Israel, for sacrifices and for burnt offerings and for a peace offering, to make atonement for you, saith the Lord God.
¹³ And all the people shall give this heave-offering unto the ruler of Israel; and through the ruler shall be the burnt offerings. And the sacrifices and the drink offerings shall be in the feasts, and in the new moons, and in the Sabbaths, and in all the feasts of the house of Israel. He himself shall make the [offerings] for sin, and the sacrifice, and the burnt offerings, and the peace offerings, to make atonement for the house of Israel.
¹⁴ Thus saith the Lord God: In the first month, on the first day of the month, ye shall take a calf from the oxen, without blemish, to make atonement for the holy [place].
¹⁵ And the priest shall take of the blood of the calf of the atonement, and shall put it upon the doorposts of the House, and upon the four corners of the Temple, and upon the altar, and upon the doorposts of the gate of the inner court.
¹⁶ And thus shalt thou do in the seventh month.
