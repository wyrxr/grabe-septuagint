**11** ταύτης· ἀφέλετε ἀφ᾿ ἡμῶν τὴν τρίβον τοῦτον, καὶ ἀφέλετε ἀφ᾿ ἡμῶν
**12** τὸν ἅγιον τοῦ Ἰσραήλ. Διὰ τοῦτο οὕτω λέγει Κύριος ὁ ἅγιος τοῦ Ἰσραήλ· ὅτι ἠπειθήσατε τοῖς λόγοις τούτοις, καὶ ἠλπίσατε ἐπὶ ψεύδει, καὶ ὅτι ἐπεγύμνωσας, καὶ πεποιθὼς ἐγένου ἐπὶ τῷ λόγῳ τούτῳ,
**13** διὰ τοῦτο ἔσται ὑμῖν ἡ ἁμαρτία αὕτη, ὡς τεῖχος πῖπτον παραχρῆμα, πόλεως ὀχυρᾶς ἑαλωκυίας, ἧς παραχρῆμα πάρεστι
**14** τὸ πτῶμα, καὶ τὸ πτῶμα αὐτῆς ἔσται ὡς σύντριμμα ἀγγείου ὀστρακίνου, ἐκ κεραμίου λεπτὸν, ὥστε μὴ εὑρεῖν ἐν αὐτοῖς ὄστρακον, ἐν ᾧ πῦρ ἀρεῖς ἀπὸ καύστρας, καὶ ἐν ᾧ ἀποσυριεῖς ὕδωρ μικρόν.
**15** Ὅτι οὕτως λέγει Κύριος Κύριος ὁ ἅγιος Ἰσραήλ· ὅταν ἀποστραφεὶς στενάξῃς, τότε σωθήσῃ, καὶ γνώσῃ, ποῦ ἦσθα· ὅτε ἐπεποιθείεις ἐπὶ τοῖς ματαίοις, ματαία ἡ ἰσχὺς ὑμῶν ἐγενήθη·
**16** Καὶ οὐκ ἠβούλεσθε ἀκούειν, ἀλλὰ εἴπατε· ἐφ᾿ ἵπποις φευξόμεθα· διὰ τοῦτο φεύξεσθε· καὶ εἴπατε, ἐπὶ κούφοις ἀναβάταις ἐσόμεθα·
**17** Διὰ τοῦτο κοῦφοι ἔσονται οἱ διώκοντες ὑμᾶς. Καὶ διὰ φωνὴν ἑνὸς φεύξονται χίλιοι, καὶ διὰ φωνὴν πέντε φεύξονται πολλοὶ, ἕως ἂν καταλειφθῆτε ὡς ἱστὸς ἐπ᾿ ὄρους, καὶ ὡς σημαῖον φέρον ἐπὶ βουνοῦ.
**18** Καὶ πάλιν μενεῖ ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ οἰκτεῖραι ὑμᾶς, καὶ διὰ τοῦτο ὑψωθήσεται τοῦ ἐλεῆσαι ὑμᾶς· διότι κριτὴς Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν ἐστι, (καὶ ποῦ καταλείψετε τὴν δόξαν ὑμῶν ;) μακάριοι πάντες οἱ ἐμμένοντες ἐν αὐτῷ.
**19** Διότι λαὸς ἅγιος ἐν Σιὼν οἰκήσει, καὶ Ἰερουσαλήμ κλαυθμῷ οὐκ ἔκλαυσεν, ἐλεήσόν με· ἐλεήσει καὶ σὲ, πρὸς τὴν φωνὴν τῆς κραυγῆς σου, ἡνίκα εἶδε, καὶ ἐπήκουσέ σου.
**20** Καὶ δώσει Κύριος ὑμῖν ἄρτον θλίψεως καὶ ὕδωρ στενὸν, καὶ οὐκ . . . οὐ μὴ ἐγγίσωσι σοὶ οἱ πλανῶντες σε· ὅτι οἱ ὀφθαλμοί σου ὄ-
**21** ψονται τοὺς πλανῶντας, καὶ τὰ ὦτά σου ἀκούσονται τοὺς λόγους τῶν ὀπίσω σε πλανητῶν, οἱ λέγοντες· αὕτη ἡ ὁδὸς, πορευθῶμεν ἐν αὐτῇ, εἴτε δεξιᾷ εἴτε ἀριστερά.
**22** Καὶ μιανεῖς τὰ εἴδωλα τὰ περιηργυρωμένα, ἃ περικεχρυσωμένα λεπτὰ ποιήσεις, καὶ λικμήσεις ὡς ὕδωρ ἀποκαθημένης, καὶ ὡς κόπρον ὤσεις αὐτά.
**23** Τότε ἔσται ὁ ζυγὸς τῷ σπέρματι τῆς γῆς σου, καὶ ὁ ἄρτος τοῦ γεννήματος τῆς γῆς σου ἔσται πλησμονὴ καὶ λιπαρός· καὶ βοσκηθήσεταί σου τὰ κτήνη τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ τόπον πίονα καὶ εὐρύχωρον,
**24** καὶ οἱ ταῦροι ὑμῶν καὶ οἱ βόες οἱ ἐργαζόμενοι τὴν γῆν, φάγονται ἄχυρα ἀναπεποιημένα ἐν κριθῇ λελικμημένη.
**25** Καὶ ἔσται ἐπὶ παντὸς ὄρους ὑψηλοῦ, καὶ ἐπὶ παντὸς βουνοῦ μετεώρου ὕδωρ διαπορευόμενον ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ,

**Chapter 30**
**11** ...and turn us away from this path; remove from us this way, and take away from us the Holy One of Israel.'

**12** Therefore thus saith the Lord, the Holy One of Israel: 'Because ye have disobeyed these words, and have put your trust in falsehood, and because ye have exposed [your transgressions], and have relied upon this word,
**13** therefore shall this sin be unto you as a wall that falleth suddenly, of a strong city that hath been captured, whose fall cometh suddenly,
**14** and the fall thereof shall be as the crushing of a potter's vessel, even of a fine shard of earthenware, so that one shall not find among them a sherd, wherewith to take fire from a hearth, or wherewith to draw up a little water.

**15** For thus saith the Lord, the Lord, the Holy One of Israel: 'When ye turn back, and sigh [in repentance], then shall ye be saved, and ye shall know where ye were; when ye did trust in vain things, your strength became vain.
**16** But ye would not hearken; but ye said, 'We will flee upon horses!' Therefore shall ye flee. And ye said, 'We shall be upon swift riders!'
**17** Therefore shall your pursuers be swift. And by the voice of one shall a thousand flee, and by the voice of five shall many flee, until ye be left as a mast upon a mountain, and as a standard borne upon a hill.

**18** And again shall God abide to have mercy upon you, and for this cause shall He be exalted, to show mercy unto you; for the Lord your God is a Judge (and where will ye forsake your glory?). Blessed are all they that abide in Him.
**19** For a holy people shall dwell in Zion, even Jerusalem. She wept not with lamentation, [crying] 'Have mercy on me!' [But know that] He shall have mercy on thee also, at the voice of thy cry, when He saw, and heard thee.
**20** And the Lord shall give you the bread of affliction and scant water. And not [...] they who mislead thee shall not draw nigh unto thee. For thine eyes shall see those who mislead thee,
**21** and thine ears shall hear the words of those who lead thee astray from behind, saying, 'This is the way; walk ye in it,' whether to the right or to the left.
**22** And thou shalt defile the idols plated with silver, [and those] which, being plated with gold, thou shalt make thin, and shalt winnow them as the water of a woman in her impurity, and as dung shalt thou cast them away.

**23** Then shall the produce [yielded] to the seed of thy land be plenteous and rich, and the bread of the produce of thy land shall be fullness and fatness; and thy cattle shall feed in that day in a rich and wide place,
**24** and your oxen and your steers that work the ground shall eat reaped fodder, winnowed with barley.
**25** And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every lofty hill, water flowing forth in that day,
