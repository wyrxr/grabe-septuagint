**ΨΑΛΜ. ϟΗ΄. XCVIII.**
3 ἔστι. Καὶ τιμὴ βασιλέως κρίσιν ἀγαπᾷ· σὺ ἡτοίμασας εὐθύτητας,
   κρίσιν καὶ δικαιοσύνην ἐν Ἰακὼβ σὺ ἐποίησας. Ὑψοῦτε Κύριον τὸν
4 Θεὸν ἡμῶν, καὶ προσκυνεῖτε τῷ ὑποποδίῳ τῶν ποδῶν αὐτοῦ, ὅτι
   ἁγιόν ἐστι. Μωυσῆς καὶ Ἀαρὼν ἐν τοῖς ἱερεῦσιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ Σαμουὴλ
5 ἐν τοῖς ἐπικαλουμένοις τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ· ἐπεκαλοῦντο τὸν Κύριον,
   καὶ αὐτὸς εἰσήκουσεν αὐτῶν. Ἐν στύλῳ νεφέλης ἐλάλει πρὸς αὐ-
6 τούς· (ὅτι) ἐφύλασσον τὰ μαρτύρια αὐτοῦ καὶ τὸ πρόσαγμα (αὐ-
   τοῦ), ὃ ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς. Κύριε ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν σὺ ἐπήκουσας αὐτῶν·
7 ὁ Θεὸς σὺ εὔιλατος ἐγίνου αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἐκδικῶν ἐπὶ πάντα τὰ ἐπι-
   τηδεύματα αὐτῶν. Ὑψοῦτε Κύριον τὸν Θεὸν ἡμῶν, καὶ προσκυ-
8 νεῖτε εἰς ὄρος ἅγιον αὐτοῦ ὅτι ἅγιος Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ϟΘ΄. XCIX.**

1 ΨΑΛΜΟΣ εἰς ἐξομολόγησιν. Ἀλαλάξατε τῷ Κυρίῳ πᾶσα ἡ
   γῆ· δουλεύσατε τῷ Κυρίῳ ἐν εὐφροσύνῃ, εἰσέλθατε ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ
2 ἐν ἀγαλλιάσει. Γνῶτε ὅτι Κύριος αὐτός ἐστιν ὁ Θεὸς (ἡμῶν)· αὐ-
   τὸς ἐποίησεν ἡμᾶς, καὶ οὐχ ἡμεῖς· ἡμεῖς δὲ λαὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ πρό-
3 βατα νομῆς αὐτοῦ. Εἰσέλθατε εἰς τὰς πύλας αὐτοῦ ἐν ἐξομολογή-
   σει, εἰς τὰς αὐλὰς αὐτοῦ ἐν ὕμνοις· ἐξομολογεῖσθε αὐτῷ, αἰνεῖτε τὸ
4 ὄνομα αὐτοῦ. Ὅτι χρηστὸς Κύριος, (ὅτι) εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τὸ ἔλεος
   αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἕως γενεᾶς καὶ γενεᾶς ἡ ἀλήθεια αὐτοῦ.

**ΨΑΛΜ. Ρ΄. C.**

1 ΨΑΛΜΟΣ τῷ Δαυίδ. Ἔλεον καὶ κρίσιν ἄσομαί σοι Κύριε·
   ψαλῶ καὶ συνήσω ἐν ὁδῷ ἀμώμῳ, πότε ἥξεις πρὸς μέ; διεπορευό-
2 μην ἐν ἀκακίᾳ καρδίας μου ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ οἴκου μου. Οὐ προεθέμην
   πρὸ ὀφθαλμῶν μου πρᾶγμα παράνομον· ποιοῦντας παραβάσεις
   ἐμίσησα· οὐκ ἐκολλήθη μοι καρδία σκαμβή· ἐκκλίνοντος ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ
3 τοῦ πονηροῦ οὐκ ἐγίνωσκον. Τὸν καταλαλοῦντα λάθρα τοῦ πλη-
4 σίον αὐτοῦ, τοῦτον ἐξεδίωκον· ὑπερηφάνῳ ὀφθαλμῷ καὶ ἀπλήστῳ
   καρδίᾳ τούτῳ οὐ συνήσθιον. Οἱ ὀφθαλμοί μου ἐπὶ τοὺς πιστοὺς
5 τῆς γῆς, τοῦ συγκαθῆσθαι (αὐτοὺς) μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ· πορευόμενος ἐν ὁδῷ
   ἀμώμῳ, οὗτός μοι ἐλειτούργει. Οὐ κατώκει ἐν μέσῳ τῆς οἰκίας
6 μου ποιῶν ὑπερηφανίαν· λαλῶν ἄδικα οὐ κατεύθυνεν ἐνώπιον τῶν

**PSALM XCVIII.**
(continued)

3 ...it is.
   And the honour of a king loveth judgment;
   Thou hast prepared uprightness;
   Thou hast made judgment and righteousness in Jacob.
4 Exalt ye the Lord our God,
   And worship at the footstool of His feet;
   For holy is it.
5 Moses and Aaron among His priests,
   And Samuel among them that call upon His Name;
   They called upon the Lord, and He heard them.
6 He spake unto them in the pillar of cloud;
   [For] they kept His testimonies
   And His ordinance, which He gave them.
7 O Lord our God, Thou didst hear them;
   O God, Thou becamest gracious unto them,
   And didst take vengeance on all their inventions.
8 Exalt ye the Lord our God,
   And worship toward His holy mountain;
   For holy is the Lord our God.

**PSALM XCIX.**
A Psalm of Thanksgiving.

1 Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth;
   Serve the Lord with gladness;
   Come before His presence with exultation.
2 Know ye that the Lord Himself is [our] God;
   It is He that hath made us, and not we ourselves;
   We are His people, and the sheep of His pasture.
3 Enter into His gates with thanksgiving,
   [And] into His courts with hymns;
   Give thanks unto Him, and bless His Name.
4 For the Lord is good;
   [For] His mercy endureth forever,
   And His truth from generation to generation.

**PSALM C.**
A Psalm of David.

1 Of mercy and judgment will I sing unto Thee, O Lord;
   I will chant praises and I will be wise in a blameless way,
   [Asking,] When wilt Thou come unto me?
2 I walked in the guilelessness of my heart in the midst of my house.
   I would set no unlawful thing before mine eyes;
   Those that committed transgressions did I hate;
3 A crooked heart shall not cleave unto me;
   As for him that departeth from me, that wicked person,
   Him will I not know.
4 Whoso privily slandered his neighbour, him would I drive away;
   Him that had a proud eye and an insatiable heart,
   With such a one would I not eat.
5 Mine eyes are upon the faithful of the land,
   That they may dwell with me;
   He that walketh in a blameless way, he shall minister unto me.
6 He that worketh pride shall not dwell in the midst of my house;
   He that speaketh unrighteous things shall not prosper before mine
