1 Ἐπὶ τῶν ποταμῶν Βαβυλῶνος, ἐκεῖ ἐκαθίσαμεν καὶ ἐκλαύσαμεν,
2 ἐν τῷ μνησθῆναι ἡμᾶς τῆς Σιῶν· ἐπὶ ταῖς ἰτέαις ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῆς
(ἐκεῖ) ἐκρεμάσαμεν τὰ ὄργανα ἡμῶν.
3 Ὅτι ἐκεῖ ἐπηρώτησαν ἡμᾶς οἱ αἰχμαλωτεύοντες ἡμᾶς λόγους
ᾠδῶν, καὶ οἱ
4 ἀπαγαγόντες ἡμᾶς ὕμνον· ᾄσατε ἡμῖν ἐκ τῶν ᾠδῶν Σιών. Πῶς
5 ᾄσομεν τὴν ᾠδὴν Κυρίου ἐπὶ γῆς ἀλλοτρίας;
6 Ἐὰν ἐπιλάθωμαί σου Ἱερουσαλήμ, ἐπιλησθείη ἡ δεξιά μου·
κολληθείη ἡ γλῶσσά μου τῷ λάρυγγί μου, ἐὰν μὴ σου μνησθῶ,
ἐὰν μὴ προανατάξωμαι τὴν
7 Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐν ἀρχῇ τῆς εὐφροσύνης μου. Μνήσθητι Κύριε τῶν
υἱῶν Ἐδὼμ τὴν ἡμέραν Ἱερουσαλήμ, τῶν λεγόντων· ἐκκενοῦτε,
8 ἐκκενοῦτε, ἕως οὗ ὁ θεμέλιος ἐν αὐτῇ. Θυγάτηρ Βαβυλῶνος ἡ
ταλαίπωρος, μακάριος ὃς ἀνταποδώσει σοι τὸ ἀνταπόδομά σου, ὃ
9 ἀνταπέδωκας ἡμῖν· μακάριος ὃς κρατήσει καὶ ἐδαφιεῖ τὰ νήπιά
σου πρὸς τὴν πέτραν.

**PSALM 135 (LXX 135) - *continued***

**16** into the Red Sea.
   For His mercy endureth for ever.
   To Him who led His people through the wilderness;
**17** For His mercy endureth for ever.
   To Him who smote great kings;
**18** For His mercy endureth for ever.
   And slew mighty kings;
**19** For His mercy endureth for ever.
   Sihon king of the Amorites;
**20** For His mercy endureth for ever.
   And Og king of Bashan;
**21** For His mercy endureth for ever.
   And gave their land for an inheritance;
**22** For His mercy endureth for ever.
   An inheritance to Israel His servant;
**23** For His mercy endureth for ever.
   For in our low estate did (the Lord) remember us;
**24** For His mercy endureth for ever.
   And redeemed us from our enemies;
**25** For His mercy endureth for ever.
   Who giveth food to all flesh;
**26** For His mercy endureth for ever.
   Give thanks unto the God of Heaven;
   For His mercy endureth for ever.

**PSALM 136 (LXX 136).**

*A Psalm of David.*
**1** By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down and wept,
**2** when we remembered Zion.
   Upon the willows in the midst thereof (there) we hanged up our instruments.
**3** For there they that carried us away captive demanded of us words of songs,
   and they that led us away [demanded] a hymn;
**4** [saying,] 'Sing us one of the songs of Zion!'
   How shall we sing the Lord's song upon a foreign land?
**5** If I forget thee, O Jerusalem,
   may my right hand forget its skill;
**6** may my tongue cleave to my throat,
   if I remember thee not,
   if I prefer not Jerusalem above the beginning of my joy.
**7** Remember, O Lord, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem,
   who said, 'Lay her bare, lay her bare,
**8** even to her foundation.'
   O daughter of Babylon, thou that art wretched,
   blessed is he that shall repay thee thy recompense,
   which thou didst recompense unto us.
**9** Blessed is he that shall seize and dash thy infants against the rock.

**PSALM 137 (LXX 137).**

*A Psalm of David, (of Zechariah).*
**1** I will give thanks unto Thee, O Lord, with my whole heart,
   and before angels will I sing praise unto Thee.
**2** I will worship toward
