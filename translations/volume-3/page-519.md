**Ω Σ Η Ε**
**ΚΕΦ. Β΄. Γ΄.**
ἐπελάθετο, λέγει Κύριος. Διὰ τοῦτο ἐγὼ πλανῶ αὐτὴν, καὶ τάξω **14**
αὐτὴν ὡς ἔρημον, καὶ λαλήσω ἐπὶ τὴν καρδίαν αὐτῆς. Καὶ δώσω **15**
αὐτῇ τὰ κτήματα αὐτῆς ἐκεῖθεν, καὶ τὴν κοιλάδα ᾿Αχὼρ, δια-
νοῖξαι σύνεσιν αὐτῆς· καὶ ταπεινωθήσεται ἐκεῖ κατὰ τὰς ἡμέρας
νηπιότητος αὐτῆς· καὶ κατὰ τὰς ἡμέρας ἀναβάσεως αὐτῆς ἐκ γῆς
Αἰγύπτου. Καὶ ἔσται ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ, καλέσει με ὁ ἀνὴρ **16**
μου, λέγει Κύριος, καὶ οὐ καλέσει με οὐκέτι Βααλεὶμ· καὶ ἐξαρῶ **17**
τὰ ὀνόματα τῶν Βααλεὶμ ἐκ στόματος αὐτῆς, καὶ οὐ μὴ μνησθῶ-
σιν ἔτι τὰ ὀνόματα αὐτῶν. Καὶ διαθήσομαι αὐτοῖς ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ **18**
ἡμέρᾳ διαθήκην μετὰ τῶν θηρίων τοῦ ἀγροῦ, καὶ μετὰ τῶν πε-
τεινῶν τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ μετὰ τῶν ἑρπετῶν τῆς γῆς, καὶ τόξον,
καὶ ῥομφαίαν, καὶ πόλεμον συντρίψω ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς, καὶ κατοι-
κιῶ αὐτοὺς ἐπ᾿ ἐλπίδι. Καὶ μνηστεύσομαι σε ἐμαυτῷ εἰς τὸν αἰ- **19**
ῶνα· καὶ μνηστεύσομαι σε ἐμαυτῷ ἐν δικαιοσύνῃ καὶ ἐν κρίματι,
καὶ ἐν ἐλέει καὶ ἐν οἰκτιρμοῖς· καὶ μνηστεύσομαι σε ἐμαυτῷ ἐν **20**
πίστει, καὶ ἐπιγνώσῃ τὸν Κύριον. Καὶ ἔσται ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ, **21**
λέγει Κύριος, ἐπακούσομαι τῷ οὐρανῷ, καὶ ὁ οὐρανὸς ἐπακούσε-
ται τῇ γῇ· καὶ ἡ γῆ ἐπακούσεται τὸν σῖτον, καὶ τὸν οἶνον, καὶ τὸ **22**
ἔλαιον· καὶ αὐτὰ ἐπακούσεται τῷ ᾿Ιεζραέλ. Καὶ σπερῶ αὐτὴν ἐμαυ- **23**
τῷ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἐλεήσω τὴν οὐκ ἠλεημένην· καὶ ἐρῶ τῷ οὐ λαῷ
μου, λαός μου εἶ σὺ, καὶ αὐτὸς ἐρεῖ, Κύριος ὁ Θεός μου εἶ σύ.

**ΚΕΦ. Γ΄. III.**

ΚΑΙ εἶπε Κύριος πρός με· ἔτι πορεύθητι, καὶ ἀγάπησον **1**
γυναῖκα ἀγαπῶσαν πονηρὰ καὶ μοιχαλὶν· καθὼς ἀγαπᾷ ὁ Θεός
τοὺς υἱοὺς ᾿Ισραὴλ, καὶ αὐτοὶ ἀποβλέπουσιν ἐπὶ θεοὺς ἀλλοτρί-
ους, καὶ φιλοῦσι πέμματα μετὰ σταφίδων. Καὶ ἐμισθωσάμην αὐ- **2**
τὴν ἐμαυτῷ πεντεκαίδεκα ἀργυρίου, καὶ Γομὸρ κριθῶν, καὶ νέ-
βελ οἴνου. Καὶ εἶπα πρὸς αὐτήν· ἡμέρας πολλὰς καθήσῃ ἐπ᾿ ἐμοὶ, **3**
καὶ οὐ μὴ πορνεύσῃς, οὐδὲ μὴ γένῃ ἀνδρὶ ἑτέρῳ, κἀγὼ ἐπὶ σοί.
Διότι ἡμέρας πολλὰς καθήσονται οἱ υἱοὶ ᾿Ισραὴλ, οὐκ ὄντος βα- **4**
σιλέως, οὐδὲ ὄντος ἄρχοντος, οὐδὲ οὔσης θυσίας, οὐδὲ ὄντος θυ-
σιαστηρίου, οὔτε ἱερατείας, οὔτε δήλων· καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα ἐπιστρέ- **5**
ψουσιν οἱ υἱοὶ ᾿Ισραὴλ, καὶ ἐπιζητήσουσι τὸν Θεὸν Κύριον αὐτῶν,
καὶ Δαυὶδ τὸν βασιλέα αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐκστήσονται ἐπὶ τῷ Κυρίῳ
καὶ ἐπὶ τοῖς ἀγαθοῖς αὐτοῦ ἐπ᾿ ἐσχάτου τῶν ἡμερῶν.

**CHAPTER 2**

**14** Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and will lead her into the wilderness, and will speak tenderly unto her heart.
**15** And I will give her her possessions from thence, and the Valley of Achor [shall be] for the opening of her understanding; and she shall be humbled there as in the days of her youth, and as in the days of her coming up from the land of Egypt.
**16** And it shall be in that day, saith the Lord, that she shall call Me, "My Husband," and shall no longer call Me "Baalim."
**17** For I will take away the names of the Baalim from her mouth, and their names shall no more be mentioned.
**18** And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the birds of the air, and with the creeping things of the earth; and the bow, and the sword, and war will I break from the earth; and I will make them to dwell in safety.
**19** And I will betroth thee unto Myself forever; yea, I will betroth thee unto Myself in righteousness, and in justice,
**20** and in mercy, and in compassions; and I will betroth thee unto Myself in faithfulness, and thou shalt know the Lord.
**21** And it shall be in that day, saith the Lord, that I will hearken unto the heaven, and the heaven shall hearken unto the earth;
**22** and the earth shall hearken unto the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall hearken unto Jezreel.
**23** And I will sow her unto Myself in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say unto them which were not My people, "Thou art My people"; and they shall say, "Thou art the Lord our God."

**CHAPTER 3**

**1** And the Lord said unto me, "Go yet again, and love a woman that loveth wickedness and is an adulteress, even as the Lord loveth the sons of Israel, though they look to strange gods and love cakes with raisins."
**2** So I bought her for myself for fifteen [shekels] of silver, and a homer of barley, and a measure of wine.
**3** And I said unto her, "Thou shalt abide with me for many days; and thou shalt not play the harlot, nor shalt thou be with another man; and I will be for thee."
**4** For many days shall the sons of Israel abide without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an altar, neither a priesthood, nor [sacred] oracles.
**5** And after these things shall the sons of Israel return, and shall seek the Lord their God, and David their king; and they shall stand in awe of the Lord and of His goodness in the last days.
