ΚΕΦ. ΞΖ. ΗΣΑΙΑΣ 1211
σιν ὑμᾶς καὶ βδελυσσομένοις, ἵνα τὸ ὀφθῇ ἐν τῇ εὐφροσύνῃ αὐτῶν, κἀκεῖνοι αἰσχυνθήσονται.
6 Φωνὴ κραυγῆς ἐκ πόλεως, φωνὴ ἐκ ναοῦ, φωνὴ Κυρίου ἀνταποδίδοντος
ἀνταπόδοσιν τοῖς ἀντικειμένοις αὐτοῦ.
7 Πρὶν τὴν ὠδίνουσαν τεκεῖν, πρὶν ἢ ἐλθεῖν τὸν πόνον τῶν ὠδίνων, ἐξέφυγε, καὶ ἔτεκεν ἄρσεν.
8 Τίς ἤκουσε τοιοῦτο, καὶ τίς ἑώρακεν οὕτως; εἰ ὤδινε γῆ ἐν μιᾷ ἡμέρᾳ, εἰ ἐτέχθη ἔθνος εἰς ἅπαξ; ὅτι ὤδινε καὶ ἔτεκε Σιὼν τὰ παιδία αὐτῆς.
9 Ἐγὼ δὲ ἔδωκα τὴν προσδοκίαν ταύτην, καὶ οὐκ ἐμνήσθης μου, εἶπε Κύριος· οὐχ ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ γεννῶσαν καὶ στείραν ἐποίησα; εἶπεν ὁ Θεός σου.
10 Εὐφράνθητι ἅμα Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ πανηγυρίσατε πάντες οἱ ἐνοικοῦντες ἐν αὐτῇ, οἱ ἀγαπῶντες
αὐτήν, χάρητε ἅμα αὐτῇ χαρᾶν, πάντες ὅσοι πενθεῖτε ἐπ᾿ αὐτῇ,
11 ἵνα θηλάσητε, καὶ ἐμπλησθῆτε ἀπὸ μαστοῦ παρακλήσεως αὐτῆς, ἵνα ἐκθηλάσαντες τρυφήσητε ἀπὸ εἰσόδου δόξης αὐτῆς.
12 Ὅτι τάδε λέγει Κύριος· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐκκλίνω εἰς αὐτοὺς ὡς ποταμὸς εἰρήνης, καὶ ὡς χειμάρρους ἐπικλύζων δόξαν ἐθνῶν· τὰ παιδία αὐτῶν
ἐπ᾿ ὤμων ἀρθῶσινται, καὶ ἐπὶ γονάτων παρακληθήσονται.
13 Ὡσεὶ τινα μήτηρ αὐτοῦ παρακαλέσει, ὅτι οὕτως καὶ ἐγὼ παρακαλέσω ὑμᾶς, καὶ ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ παρακληθήσεσθε.
14 Καὶ ὄψεσθε, καὶ χαρήσεται ὑμῶν ἡ καρδία, καὶ τὰ ὀστᾶ ὑμῶν ὡς βοτάνη ἀνατελεῖ·
καὶ γνωσθήσεται ἡ χεὶρ Κυρίου τοῖς φοβουμένοις αὐτόν, καὶ ἀπειλήσει τοῖς ἀπειθοῦσιν.
15 Ἰδοὺ γὰρ Κύριος ὡς πῦρ ἥξει, καὶ ὡς καταιγὶς τὰ ἅρματα αὐτοῦ, ἀποδοῦναι ἐν θυμῷ ἐκδίκησιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀποσκορακισμὸν αὐτοῦ ἐν φλογὶ πυρός.
16 Ἐν γὰρ τῷ πυρὶ Κυρίου κριθήσεται πᾶσα ἡ γῆ, καὶ ἐν τῇ ῥομφαίᾳ αὐτοῦ πᾶσα
σάρξ· πολλοὶ τραυματίαι ἔσονται ὑπὸ Κυρίου,
17 οἱ ἁγνιζόμενοι καὶ καθαριζόμενοι εἰς τοὺς κήπους, καὶ ἐν τοῖς προθύροις ἔσθοντες
κρέας ὕειον, καὶ τὰ βδελύγματα, καὶ τὸν μῦν, ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ καταναλωθήσονται, εἶπε Κύριος.
18 Κἀγὼ τὰ ἔργα αὐτῶν καὶ τὸν λογισμὸν αὐτῶν, ἔρχομαι συναγαγεῖν πάντα τὰ ἔθνη καὶ τὰς γλώσ-
σας, καὶ ἥξουσι καὶ ὄψονται τὴν δόξαν μου,
19 καὶ καταλείψω ἐπ᾿ αὐτῶν σημεῖον, καὶ ἐξαποστελῶ ἐξ αὐτῶν σεσωσμένους εἰς τὰ
ἔθνη εἰς Θαρσεῖς, καὶ Φούδ, καὶ Λούδ, καὶ Μοσόχ, καὶ Θοβέλ,
καὶ εἰς τὴν Ἑλλάδα, καὶ εἰς τὰς νήσους τὰς πόῤῥω, οἳ οὐκ ἀκη-
κόασί μου τὸ ὄνομα, οὐδὲ ἑωράκασι τὴν δόξαν μου· καὶ ἀναγ-
γελοῦσίν μου τὴν δόξαν ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι,
20 καὶ ἄξουσι τοὺς ἀδελφούς ὑμῶν ἐκ πάντων τῶν ἐθνῶν δῶρον Κυρίῳ, μεθ᾽ ἵππων καὶ ἁρ-
μάτων ἐν λαμπήναις ἡμιόνων μετὰ σκιαδίων εἰς τὴν ἁγίαν πόλιν
Ἱερουσαλήμ, εἶπε Κύριος, ὡς ἀνενέγκαισαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐμοὶ
21 τὰς θυσίας αὐτῶν μετὰ ψαλμῶν εἰς τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου, καὶ ἀπ᾽
αὐτῶν λήψομαι ἐμαυτῷ ἱερεῖς καὶ λευΐτας, εἶπε Κύριος.
22 Ὃν τρόπον γὰρ ὁ οὐρανὸς καινὸς καὶ ἡ γῆ καινή, ἃ ἐγὼ ποιῶ, μένει
ἐνώπιον μου, λέγει Κύριος, οὕτως στήσεται τὸ σπέρμα ὑμῶν
καὶ τὸ ὄνομα ὑμῶν.
23 Καὶ ἔσται μῆνα ἐκ μηνός, καὶ σάββατον ἐκ σαββάτου, ἥξει πᾶσα σὰρξ ἐνώπιον μου προσκυνῆσαι ἐν Ἱε-
ρουσαλήμ, εἶπε Κύριος.
24 Καὶ ἐξελεύσονται, καὶ ὄψονται τὰ κῶλα τῶν ἀνθρώπων τῶν παραβεβηκότων ἐν ἐμοί· ὁ γὰρ σκώληξ αὐτῶν
οὐ τελευτήσει, καὶ τὸ πῦρ αὐτῶν οὐ σβεσθήσεται, καὶ ἔσονται
εἰς ὅρασιν πάσῃ σαρκί.

#### Chapter 66

**5** ...to those that hate you and abhor you: 'Let this [matter] be manifest in their joy, and they shall be put to shame.'
**6** A voice of clamour from the city, a voice from the temple,
    the voice of the Lord rendering recompense unto His adversaries.
**7** Ere she that travaileth brought forth,
    ere the pain of her birth-pangs came,
    she escaped, and bore a male child.
**8** Who hath heard such a thing? And who hath seen [such things] thus?
    Hath a land travailed in a single day?
    Hath a nation been born at once?
    For Zion travailed, and brought forth her children.
**9** But I gave this expectation, and thou didst not remember Me, saith the Lord.
    Behold, have I not made [the womb] both bringing forth and barren? saith thy God.
**10** Be glad, O Jerusalem, and keep holy day,
    all ye that dwell therein, ye that love her;
    rejoice ye with her, even with joy, all ye that mourn over her,
**11** That ye may suck, and be satisfied from the breast of her consolation;
    that having suckled, ye may delight yourselves from the entrance of her glory.
**12** For thus saith the Lord:
    Behold, I will incline unto them as a river of peace,
    and as a torrent overflowing with the glory of the Gentiles.
    Their children shall be lifted upon [their] shoulders,
    and upon [their] knees shall they be comforted.
**13** As one whom his mother shall comfort,
    so also will I comfort you;
    and in Jerusalem shall ye be comforted.
**14** And ye shall see, and your heart shall rejoice,
    and your bones shall spring forth as the grass;
    and the hand of the Lord shall be known unto them that fear Him,
    and He shall threaten those that are disobedient.
**15** For behold, the Lord shall come as fire,
    and His chariots as a tempest,
    to render His vengeance in wrath,
    and His [utter] rejection in a flame of fire.
**16** For by the fire of the Lord shall all the earth be judged,
    and by His sword all flesh;
    many shall be the wounded by the Lord,
**17** [even] they that sanctify themselves and cleanse themselves for the gardens,
    and in the porches eating swine's flesh, and abominations, and the mouse,
    together shall they be consumed, saith the Lord.
**18** And I, as for their works and their thoughts,
    I come to gather all the nations and the tongues,
    and they shall come and behold My glory.
**19** And I will set a sign upon them,
    and I will send forth from among them those that are saved, unto the nations,
    unto Tarshish, and Phud, and Lud, and Mosoch, and Thobel,
    and unto Hellas, and unto the islands afar off;
    [even them] who have not heard My Name, neither have they seen My glory;
    and they shall declare My glory among the nations.
**20** And they shall bring your brethren from all the nations
    as an offering unto the Lord, with horses and chariots,
    upon litters [and] mules, with canopies,
    unto the holy city Jerusalem, saith the Lord,
    as the sons of Israel did offer unto Me their sacrifices with psalms
**21** into the house of the Lord.
    And from among them will I take unto Myself priests and Levites, saith the Lord.
**22** For in like manner as the new heaven and the new earth,
    which I make, shall remain before Me, saith the Lord,
    so shall your seed and your name abide.
**23** And it shall come to pass, that from month to month, and from sabbath to sabbath,
    all flesh shall come before Me to worship in Jerusalem, saith the Lord.
**24** And they shall go forth, and they shall behold the corpses of the men
    who have transgressed against Me;
    for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched;
    and they shall be an abhorrence unto all flesh.
