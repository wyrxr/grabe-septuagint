ΚΕΦ. ΙΗʹ.
6 Ὁ δὲ ἄνθρωπος ὃς ἔσται δίκαιος, ὁ ποιῶν κρῖμα καὶ δικαιοσύνην, ἐπὶ τῶν
   ὀρέων οὐ φάγεται, καὶ τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ οὐ μὴ ἐπάρῃ πρὸς
   τὰ ἐνθυμήματα οἴκου Ἰσραήλ, καὶ τὴν γυναῖκα τοῦ πλησίον αὐτοῦ
   οὐ μὴ μιάνῃ, καὶ πρὸς γυναῖκα ἐν ἀφέδρῳ οὖσαν οὐ προσεγγιεῖ,
7 καὶ ἄνθρωπον οὐ μὴ καταδυναστεύσῃ, ἐνεχυρασμὸν ὀφείλοντος ἀ-
   ποδώσει, καὶ ἅρπαγμα οὐχ ἁρπάται· τὸν ἄρτον αὐτοῦ τῷ πεινῶντι
8 δώσει, καὶ γυμνὸν περιβαλεῖ ἱμάτιον, καὶ τὸ ἀργύριον αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ
   τόκῳ οὐ δώσει, καὶ πλεονασμὸν οὐ λήψεται· καὶ ἐξ ἀδικίας ἀπο-
   στρέψει τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ, κρῖμα δίκαιον ποιήσει ἀναμέσον ἀνδρός,
9 καὶ ἀναμέσον τοῦ πλησίον αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοῖς προστάγμασί μου πε-
   πόρευται, καὶ δικαιώματά μου πεφύλακται, τοῦ ποιῆσαι αὐτά· δί-
10 καιός ἐστι, ζωὴ ζήσεται, λέγει Ἀδωναΐ Κύριος. Ἐὰν δὲ γεννήσῃ
11 υἱὸν λοιμόν, ἐγχέοντα αἷμα καὶ ποιοῦντα ἁμαρτήματα, ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ
   τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ τοῦ δικαίου οὐκ ἐπορεύθη, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν
12 ὀρέων ἔφαγε, καὶ τὴν γυναῖκα τοῦ πλησίον αὐτοῦ ἐμίανε, καὶ
   πτωχὸν καὶ πένητα κατεδυνάστευσε, καὶ ἅρπαγμα ἥρπασε, καὶ
   ἐνεχυρασμὸν οὐκ ἀπέδωκε, καὶ εἰς τὰ εἴδωλα ἔθετο τοὺς ὀφθαλ-
13 μοὺς αὐτοῦ, ἀνομίαν πεποίηκε, μετὰ τόκου ἔδωκε, καὶ πλεονα-
   σμὸν ἔλαβεν· οὗτος ζωὴ οὐ ζήσεται, πάσας τὰς ἀνομίας ταύτας
14 ἐποίησε, θανάτῳ ἀποθανεῖται· τὸ αἷμα αὐτοῦ ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν ἔσται. Ἐὰν
   δὲ γεννήσῃ υἱόν, καὶ ἴδῃ πάσας τὰς ἁμαρτίας τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ
15 ἃς ἐποίησε, καὶ φοβηθῇ, καὶ μὴ ποιήσῃ κατ᾿ αὐτάς, ἐπὶ τῶν ὀ-
   ρέων οὐκ ἔφαγε, καὶ τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἔθετο εἰς τὰ ἐν-
   θυμήματα οἴκου Ἰσραήλ, καὶ γυναῖκα τοῦ πλησίον αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἐμία-
16 νε, καὶ ἄνθρωπον οὐ κατεδυνάστευσε, καὶ ἐνεχυρασμὸν οὐκ ἐνεχύ-
   ρασε, καὶ ἅρπαγμα οὐχ ἥρπασε, τὸν ἄρτον αὐτοῦ τῷ πεινῶντι
17 ἔδωκε, καὶ γυμνὸν περιέβαλεν ἱμάτιον, καὶ ἀπὸ ἀδικίας ἀπέστρεψε
   τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ, τόκον οὐδὲ πλεονασμὸν οὐχ ἔλαβε, δικαιοσύνην
   ἐποίησε, καὶ ἐν τοῖς προστάγμασί μου ἐπορεύθη, οὐ τελευτήσει
18 ἐν ἀδικίαις πατρὸς αὐτοῦ, ζωὴ ζήσεται. Ὁ δὲ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ ἐὰν
   θλίψει θλίψιν, καὶ ἁρπάσῃ ἅρπαγμα, ἐναντία ἐποίησεν ἐν μέσῳ
19 τοῦ λαοῦ μου, καὶ ἀποθανεῖται ἐν τῇ ἀδικίᾳ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐρεῖτε·
   τί ὅτι οὐκ ἔλαβεν ὁ υἱὸς τὴν ἀδικίαν τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ; ὅτι ὁ
   υἱὸς δικαιοσύνην καὶ ἔλεος ἐποίησε, πάντα τὰ νόμιμά μου συ-
20 νετήρησε, καὶ ἐποίησεν αὐτά, ζωὴ ζήσεται. Ἡ δὲ ψυχὴ ἡ ἁ-
   μαρτάνουσα, αὕτη ἀποθανεῖται· υἱὸς οὐ λήψεται τὴν ἀδικίαν

### Chapter 18

**6** [He that] eateth not upon the mountains, and lifteth not up his eyes to the detestable things of the house of Israel; and the wife of his neighbor he defileth not, and unto a woman in her impurity he draweth not near;
**7** And no man shall he oppress; the pledge of a debtor he shall restore; and no plunder is plundered by him; his bread to the hungry he shall give,
**8** And the naked he shall clothe with a garment; and his money upon interest he shall not lend, nor shall he take any increase thereof; and from injustice he shall turn away his hand. Righteous judgment shall he execute between man and his neighbor;
**9** And in My statutes hath he walked, and My ordinances hath he kept, to do them. This man is righteous; he shall surely live, saith Adonai the Lord.
**10** But if he beget a son who is a pestilent man, shedding blood and committing sins;
**11** Who hath not walked in the way of his righteous father, but hath even eaten upon the mountains,
**12** And the wife of his neighbor hath defiled, and the poor and the needy hath oppressed, and hath seized by violence, and a pledge he hath not returned, and unto the idols he hath set his eyes,
**13** He hath committed lawlessness, with interest he hath given, and increment he hath taken: This man shall not surely live; all these lawless deeds hath he done, he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.
**14** But if he beget a son, and he see all the sins of his father which he hath done, and he be afraid, and do not according to them;
**15** He hath not eaten upon the mountains, and his eyes he hath not set upon the detestable things of the house of Israel, and the wife of his neighbor he hath not defiled,
**16** And no man he hath oppressed, and a pledge he hath not taken, and a thing seized by violence he hath not seized; his bread to the hungry he hath given,
**17** And the naked he hath clothed with a garment; and from injustice he hath turned away his hand; interest nor increment he hath not taken; righteousness he hath done, and in My statutes he hath walked: he shall not die in the iniquities of his father; he shall surely live.
**18** But as for his father, if he shall oppress with oppression, and seize by violence, and commit contrary deeds in the midst of My people, he shall die in his iniquity.
**19** And ye shall say, "Why hath not the son borne the iniquity of his father?" Because the son hath wrought righteousness and mercy, all My ordinances he hath diligently kept, and hath done them; he shall surely live.
**20** The soul that sinneth, it shall die. A son shall not bear the iniquity of his father, nor shall a father bear the iniquity of his son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the lawlessness of the lawless shall be upon him.
