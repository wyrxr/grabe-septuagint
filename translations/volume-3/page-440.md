**24** κύκλῳ σου, καὶ γνώσονται ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι Κύριος. Καὶ οὐκέτι ἔσονται τῷ οἴκῳ Ἰσραὴλ σκόλοψ πικρίας καὶ ἄκανθα ὀδύνης ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν περικύκλῳ αὐτῶν τῶν ἀτιμασάντων αὐτούς, καὶ γνώσονται **25** ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς αὐτῶν. Τάδε λέγει Κύριος Κύριος ὁ Θεός· καὶ συνάξω τὸν Ἰσραὴλ ἐκ τῶν ἐθνῶν οὗ διεσκορπίσθησαν ἐκεῖ, καὶ ἁγιασθήσομαι ἐν αὐτοῖς ἐνώπιον τῶν λαῶν **26** τῶν ἐθνῶν. Καὶ κατοικήσουσιν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς αὐτῶν, ἧς ἔδωκα τῷ δούλῳ μου Ἰακώβ, καὶ κατοικήσουσιν ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς ἐν ἐλπίδι, καὶ οἰκοδομήσουσιν οἰκίας, καὶ φυτεύσουσιν ἀμπελῶνας, καὶ κατοικήσουσιν ἐν ἐλπίδι, ὅταν ποιήσω κρῖμα ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς ἀτιμάσασιν αὐτοὺς ἐν τοῖς κύκλῳ αὐτῶν, καὶ γνώσονται ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς αὐτῶν, καὶ ὁ Θεὸς τῶν πατέρων αὐτῶν.

**1** Ἐν τῷ ἔτει τῷ δεκάτῳ ἐν τῷ δεκάτῳ μηνί, μιᾷ τοῦ μηνός, **2** ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρός με, λέγων· υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, στήρισον τὸ πρόσωπόν σου ἐπὶ Φαραὼ βασιλέα Αἰγύπτου, καὶ προφήτευσον **3** ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν καὶ ἐπ᾿ Αἴγυπτον ὅλην, καὶ λάλησον, καὶ εἰπόν· τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεός· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐπὶ σὲ Φαραώ, βασιλεῦ Αἰγύπτου, τὸν δράκοντα τὸν μέγαν τὸν ἐγκαθήμενον ἐν μέσῳ ποταμῶν αὐτοῦ, τὸν λέγοντα, ἐμοὶ εἰσιν οἱ ποταμοί, καὶ ἐγὼ ἐποίησα **4** αὐτούς. Καὶ δώσω τὰς παγίδας εἰς τὰς σιαγόνας σου, καὶ προσκολλήσω τοὺς ἰχθύας τοῦ ποταμοῦ σου πρὸς τὰς πτέρυγάς σου, καὶ ἀνάξω σε ἐκ μέσου τοῦ ποταμοῦ, καὶ πάντας τοὺς ἰ**5** χθύας τοῦ ποταμοῦ σου· ταῖς λεπίσι σου προσκολληθήσονται. Καὶ καταβαλῶ σε ἐν τάχει καὶ πάντας τοὺς ἰχθύας τοῦ ποταμοῦ σου ἐπὶ πρόσωπον τοῦ πεδίου πέσῃ, καὶ οὐ μὴ συναχθῇς, οὐδ᾿ οὐ μὴ περισταλῇς, τοῖς θηρίοις τῆς γῆς καὶ τοῖς πετεινοῖς τοῦ οὐρανοῦ **6** δέδωκά σε εἰς βρῶσιν, καὶ γνώσονται πάντες οἱ κατοικοῦντες Αἴγυπτον, ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι Κύριος· ἀνθ᾿ ὧν ἐγενήθης ῥάβδος καλαμίνη **7** τῷ οἴκῳ Ἰσραήλ, ὅτε ἐπελάβοντό σου τῇ χειρὶ αὐτῶν, ἐθλάσθης, καὶ ὅτε ἐπεκρότησεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς πᾶσα χείρ, καὶ ὅτε ἐπανεπαύσαντο **8** ἐπὶ σέ, συνετρίβης, καὶ συνέκλασας αὐτῶν πᾶσαν ὀσφύν. Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεός· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐπάγω ἐπὶ σὲ ῥομφαίαν, **9** καὶ ἀπολῶ ἀπὸ σοῦ ἄνθρωπον καὶ κτῆνος. Καὶ ἔσται πᾶσα ἡ γῆ

**A Literary Translation**

**Chapter 28**

**24** round about thee; and they shall know that I am the Lord. And there shall be no more unto the house of Israel a bitter thorn and a sorrowful briar from all them that are round about them, which have dishonored them; and they shall know **25** that I am the Lord their God. Thus saith Adonai the Lord God: I will also gather the house of Israel from among the nations whither they are scattered, and I shall be sanctified in them before the peoples **26** of the nations. And they shall dwell upon their own land, which I gave to My servant Jacob; and they shall dwell thereon in hope, and they shall build houses, and plant vineyards, and shall dwell in hope, when I shall execute judgment upon all them that have dishonored them in the lands round about them; and they shall know that I am the Lord their God, and the God of their fathers.

**Chapter 29**

**1** In the tenth year, in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, **2** the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and prophesy **3** against him and against all Egypt, and speak, and say, Thus saith Adonai the Lord: Behold, I am against thee, O Pharaoh, King of Egypt, that great dragon that dwelleth in the midst of his rivers, which saith, My rivers are mine own, and I have made **4** them.

And I will cast thee forth swiftly, and all the fish of thy rivers, upon the face of the field shalt thou fall; thou shalt not be gathered, nor shalt thou be interred; I have given thee for food to the beasts of the earth and to the birds of the heaven; **6** and all they that dwell in Egypt shall know that I am the Lord. Because thou wast become a staff of reed to the house of Israel, **7** when they laid hold of thee with their hand, thou wast broken; and when every hand was struck back upon them, and when they rested **8** upon thee, thou wast crushed, and thou didst break all their loins. Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will bring a sword upon thee, **9** and I will destroy from thee man and beast. And all the land
