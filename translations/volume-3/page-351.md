τὴν καρδίαν μου τοῦ ποιῆσαι τὸ βδέλυγμα τοῦτο, πρὸς τὸ ἐκμαρτεῖν τὸν Ἰούδα.
Καὶ νῦν οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραὴλ ἐπὶ 36
τὴν πόλιν, ἣν σὺ λέγεις, παραδοθήσεται εἰς χεῖρας βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος ἐν μαχαίρᾳ, καὶ ἐν λιμῷ, καὶ ἐν ἀποστολῇ.
Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ συνάγω 37
αὐτοὺς ἐκ πάσης τῆς γῆς, οὗ διέσπειρα αὐτοὺς ἐκεῖ ἐν ὀργῇ μου,
καὶ τῷ θυμῷ μου καὶ ἐν παροξυσμῷ μεγάλῳ· καὶ ἐπιστρέψω αὐτοὺς εἰς τὸν τόπον τοῦτον, καὶ καθιῶ αὐτοὺς πεποιθότας, καὶ 38
ἔσονται μοι εἰς λαόν, καὶ ἐγὼ ἔσομαι αὐτοῖς εἰς Θεόν.
Καὶ 39
δώσω αὐτοῖς ὁδὸν ἑτέραν καὶ καρδίαν ἑτέραν, φοβηθῆναί με πάσας
τὰς ἡμέρας καὶ εἰς ἀγαθὸν αὐτοῖς καὶ τοῖς τέκνοις αὐτῶν μετ᾿
αὐτοῦς.
Καὶ διαθήσομαι αὐτοῖς διαθήκην αἰώνιον, ἣν οὐ μὴ ἀποστρέψω 40
ὄπισθεν αὐτῶν, ὥστε ἀγαθοποιεῖν με αὐτοῦς, καὶ τὸν φόβον μου δώσω εἰς τὴν καρδίαν αὐτῶν, πρὸς τὸ μὴ ἀποστῆναι αὐτοὺς ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ.
Καὶ ἐπισκέψομαι τοῦ ἀγαθῶσαι αὐτούς, καὶ φυτεύσω 41
αὐτοὺς ἐν τῇ γῇ ταύτῃ ἐν πίστει, καὶ ἐν πάσῃ καρδίᾳ μου,
καὶ ἐν πάσῃ ψυχῇ μου.
Ὅτι οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος· καθὰ ἐπήγαγον 42
ἐπὶ τὸν λαὸν τοῦτον πάντα τὰ κακὰ τὰ μεγάλα ταῦτα, οὕτως
ἐγὼ ἐπάξω ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς πάντα τὰ ἀγαθά, ἃ ἐλάλησα ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς.
Καὶ κτηθήσονται ἔτι ἀγροὶ ἐν τῇ γῇ, ἣν σὺ λέγεις, ἀββατος 43
ἔσται ἀπὸ ἀνθρώπου καὶ κτήνους, καὶ παρεδόθησαν εἰς χεῖρας
Χαλδαίων, καὶ κτήσονται ἀγροὺς ἐν ἀργυρίῳ· καὶ γράψεις βι44
βλίον, καὶ σφραγιῇ, καὶ διαμαρτύρῃ μάρτυρας ἐν γῇ Βενιαμείν,
καὶ κυκλόθεν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἐν πόλεσιν Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐν πόλεσι τοῦ
ὄρους, καὶ ἐν πόλεσι τῆς Σεφηλά, καὶ ἐν πόλεσι τῆς Ναγέβ, ἔτι
ἀποστρέψω τὰς ἀποικίας αὐτῶν, φησὶ Κύριος.

    ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς Ἱερεμίαν ἐκ δευτέρου, 1
(καὶ αὐτὸς ἔτι ἦν δεδεμένος ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ τῆς φυλακῆς), λέγων·
οὕτως 2
εἶπε Κύριος, ποιῶν γῆν, καὶ πλάσσων αὐτήν, τοῦ ἀνορθῶσαι
αὐτήν, Κύριος ὄνομα αὐτῷ·
κέκραξον πρός με, καὶ ἀποκριθήσομαι 3
σοι, καὶ ἀναγγελῶ σοι μεγάλα καὶ ἰσχυρά, ἃ οὐκ ἔγνως αὐτά.
Ὅτι οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραὴλ περὶ οἴκων τῆς πόλεως 4
ταύτης, καὶ περὶ οἰκίας βασιλέως Ἰούδα τῶν καθηρημένων εἰς χάραχας

**JEREMIAH 32**

**35** ...My heart to commit this abomination, to make Judah to stumble.
**36** And now, thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof thou sayest, "It shall be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by famine, and by pestilence."
**37** Behold, I shall gather them from all the lands whither I have scattered them, in My wrath, and in My hot displeasure, and in great indignation. And I will bring them again unto this place, and I will make them dwell securely therein;
**38** and they shall be unto Me a people, and I will be unto them their God.
**39** And I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear Me all their days, for their own good, and for the good of their children after them.
**40** And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, which I will not turn away from them, that I may do them good; and My fear will I put in their hearts, that they shall not depart from Me.
**41** And I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land in truth, with My whole heart and with My whole soul.
**42** For thus saith the Lord: Just as I have brought upon this people all these great evils, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have spoken concerning them.
**43** And fields shall yet be possessed in this land, whereof thou sayest, "It is desolate, without man or beast," and which hath been delivered into the hands of the Chaldeans; yea, they shall purchase fields with silver.
**44** And thou shalt write [it in] a scroll, and seal [it], and attest [it] with witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and round about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the hill country, and in the cities of the Shephelah, and in the cities of the Negeb; for I will restore their captivity, saith the Lord.

**JEREMIAH 33**

**1** Moreover, the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah the second time, (now he was yet bound in the court of the prison,) saying,
**2** "Thus saith the Lord, who maketh the earth, and formeth it, to establish it; the Lord is His name:
**3** Call unto Me, and I will answer thee, and I will declare unto thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not.
**4** For thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the king of Judah, which are thrown down for the trenches..."
