24 ὁδῷ ἰσχύος αὐτοῦ· τὴν ὀλιγότητα τῶν ἡμερῶν μου ἀνάγγειλόν
25 μοι· μὴ ἀναγάγῃς με ἐν ἡμίσει ἡμερῶν μου· ἐν γενεᾷ γενεῶν τὰ
    ἔτη σου. Κατ᾿ ἀρχὰς σὺ Κύριε τὴν γῆν ἐθεμελίωσας, καὶ ἔργα 26
    τῶν χειρῶν σου εἰσὶν οἱ οὐρανοί. Αὐτοὶ ἀπολοῦνται, σὺ δὲ διαμε- 27
    νεῖς· καὶ πάντες ὡς ἱμάτιον παλαιωθήσονται, καὶ ὡσεὶ περιβό-
    λαιον ἀλλάξεις αὐτούς, καὶ ἀλλαγήσονται. Σὺ δὲ ὁ αὐτὸς εἶ, καὶ 28
    τὰ ἔτη σου οὐκ ἐκλείψουσιν. Υἱοὶ τῶν δούλων σου κατασκηνώσου- 29
    σι, καὶ τὸ σπέρμα αὐτῶν εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα κατευθυνθήσεται.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ΡΒ´. CII.**

Τῷ Δαυίδ. Εὐλόγει ἡ ψυχή μου τὸν Κύριον, καὶ πάντα τὰ 1
    ἐντός μου τὸ ὄνομα τὸ ἅγιον αὐτοῦ· εὐλόγει ἡ ψυχή μου τὸν Κύ- 2
    ριον, καὶ μὴ ἐπιλανθάνου πάσας τὰς ἀνταποδόσεις αὐτοῦ· τὸν εὐϊ- 3
    λατεύοντα πάσαις ταῖς ἀνομίαις σου, τὸν ἰώμενον πάσας τὰς νό-
    σους σου· τὸν λυτρούμενον ἐκ φθορᾶς τὴν ζωήν σου, τὸν στεφανοῦν- 4
    τά σε ἐν ἐλέει καὶ οἰκτιρμοῖς· τὸν ἐμπιπλῶντα ἐν ἀγαθοῖς τὴν ἐπι- 5
    θυμίαν σου· ἀνακαινισθήσεται ὡς ἀετοῦ ἡ νεότης σου. Ποιῶν ἐλεη- 6
    μοσύνας ὁ Κύριος, καὶ κρῖμα πᾶσι τοῖς ἀδικουμένοις. Ἐγνώρισε 7
    τὰς ὁδοὺς αὐτοῦ τῷ Μωυσῇ, τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραὴλ τὰ θελήματα
    αὐτοῦ· οἰκτίρμων καὶ ἐλεήμων ὁ Κύριος, μακρόθυμος καὶ πολυέ- 8
    λεος (καὶ ἀληθινός). Οὐκ εἰς τέλος ὀργισθήσεται, οὐδὲ εἰς τὸν 9
    αἰῶνα μηνιεῖ· οὐ κατὰ τὰς ἁμαρτίας ἡμῶν ἐποίησεν ἡμῖν, οὐδὲ 10
    κατὰ τὰς ἀνομίας ἡμῶν ἀνταπέδωκεν ἡμῖν. Ὅτι κατὰ τὸ ὕψος 11
    τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς, ἐκραταίωσε (Κύριος) τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ
    ἐπὶ τοὺς φοβουμένους αὐτόν· καθόσον ἀπέχουσιν ἀνατολαὶ ἀπὸ 12
    δυσμῶν, ἐμάκρυνεν ἀφ᾿ ἡμῶν τὰς ἀνομίας ἡμῶν. Καθὼς οἰκτείρει 13
    πατὴρ υἱούς, ᾠκτείρησε Κύριος τοὺς φοβουμένους αὐτόν. Ὅτι αὐ- 14
    τὸς ἔγνω τὸ πλάσμα ἡμῶν, ἐμνήσθη ὅτι χοῦς ἐσμεν. Ἄνθρωπος 15
    ὡσεὶ χόρτος αἱ ἡμέραι αὐτοῦ, ὡσεὶ ἄνθος τοῦ ἀγροῦ οὕτως ἐξαν-
    θήσει· ὅτι πνεῦμα διῆλθεν ἐν αὐτῷ, καὶ οὐχ ὑπάρξει, καὶ οὐκ ἐπι- 16
    γνώσεται ἔτι τὸν τόπον αὐτοῦ. Τὸ δὲ ἔλεος τοῦ Κυρίου ἀπὸ τοῦ 17
    αἰῶνος καὶ ἕως τοῦ αἰῶνος ἐπὶ τοὺς φοβουμένους αὐτόν· καὶ ἡ δι- 18
    καιοσύνη αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ υἱοὺς υἱῶν, τοῖς φυλάσσουσι τὴν διαθήκην αὐ- 19
    τοῦ, καὶ μεμνημένοις τῶν ἐντολῶν αὐτοῦ τοῦ ποιῆσαι αὐτάς. Κύ-
    ριος ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ ἡτοίμασε τὸν θρόνον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἡ βασιλεία αὐ- 20
    τοῦ πάντων δεσπόζει. Εὐλογεῖτε τὸν Κύριον πάντες οἱ ἄγγελοι
    αὐτοῦ, δυνατοὶ ἰσχύϊ, ποιοῦντες τὸν λόγον αὐτοῦ, τοῦ ἀκοῦσαι τῆς 21
    φωνῆς τῶν λόγων αὐτοῦ. Εὐλογεῖτε τὸν Κύριον πᾶσαι αἱ δυνάμεῖς
    αὐτοῦ, λειτουργοὶ αὐτοῦ, ποιοῦντες τὸ θέλημα αὐτοῦ. Εὐλογεῖτε 22
    τὸν Κύριον πάντα τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ ἐν παντὶ τόπῳ τῆς δεσποτίας
    αὐτοῦ· εὐλόγει ἡ ψυχή μου τὸν Κύριον.

**PSALM CI.** (continued)

24 ...the way of his strength;
    Declare unto me the fewness of my days;
25 Take me not away in the midst of my days;
    In the generation of generations are Thy years.
26 In the beginning, Thou, O Lord, didst lay the foundation of the earth,
    And the heavens are the works of Thy hands.
27 They shall perish, but Thou shalt endure;
    And they all shall wax old as a garment,
    And as a vesture shalt Thou change them,
    And they shall be changed.
28 But Thou art the same,
    And Thy years shall not fail.
29 The children of Thy servants shall abide,
    And their seed shall be established forever.

**PSALM CII.**
A Psalm of David.

1 Bless the Lord, O my soul,
    And all that is within me, bless His holy Name.
2 Bless the Lord, O my soul,
    And forget not all His benefits;
3 Who forgiveth all thine iniquities;
    Who healeth all thy diseases;
4 Who redeemeth thy life from corruption;
    Who crowneth thee with mercy and tender mercies;
5 Who satisfieth thy desire with good things;
    [So that] thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.
6 The Lord executeth righteousness and judgment
    For all them that are oppressed.
7 He made known His ways unto Moses,
    His will unto the children of Israel.
8 The Lord is compassionate and merciful,
    Long-suffering and plenteous in mercy, [and true].
9 He will not always chide,
    Neither will He keep His anger forever.
10 He hath not dealt with us according to our sins,
    Nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.
11 For as high as the heaven is above the earth,
    So hath [the Lord] His mercy prevailed over them that fear Him.
12 As far as the east is from the west,
    So far hath He removed our transgressions from us.
13 Like as a father pitieth his children,
    So the Lord pitieth them that fear Him.
14 For He knoweth our frame;
    He remembereth that we are dust.
15 As for man, his days are as grass;
    As a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.
16 For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone;
    And its place shall know it no more.
17 But the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting
    Upon them that fear Him;
18 And His righteousness unto children's children,
    To such as keep His covenant,
19 And to those that remember His commandments to do them.
    The Lord hath prepared His throne in the heavens,
20 And His kingdom ruleth over all.
    Bless the Lord, all ye His angels,
    That are mighty in strength, that do His word,
    Hearkening unto the voice of His words.
21 Bless the Lord, all ye His hosts,
    Ye ministers of His, that do His pleasure.
22 Bless the Lord, all His works
    In all places of His dominion.
    Bless the Lord, O my soul.
