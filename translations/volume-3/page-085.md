**ΨΑΛΜ. ΡΖʹ.**
8 ὑψωθήσομαι καὶ διαμεριῶ Σίκιμα, καὶ τὴν κοιλάδα τῶν σκηνῶν δια-
9 μετρήσω. Ἐμὸς ἐστι Γαλαάδ, καὶ ἐμὸς ἐστι Μανασσῆς, καὶ
   Ἐφραὶμ ἀντίληψις τῆς κεφαλῆς μου· Ἰούδας βασιλεύς μου.
10 Μωὰβ λέβης τῆς ἐλπίδος μου· ἐπὶ τὴν Ἰδουμαίαν ἐπιβαλῶ τὸ ὑπόδημά
   μου· ἐμοὶ ἀλλόφυλοι ὑπετάγησαν.
11 Τίς ἀπάξει με εἰς πόλιν περιοχῆς; (Ἢ) τίς ὁδηγήσει με ἕως τῆς Ἰδουμαίας;
12 Οὐχὶ σὺ ὁ Θεὸς ὁ ἀπωσάμενος ἡμᾶς; καὶ οὐκ ἐξελεύσῃ ὁ Θεὸς ἐν ταῖς δυνάμεσιν
   ἡμῶν;
13 Δὸς ἡμῖν βοήθειαν ἐκ θλίψεως· καὶ ματαία σωτηρία ἀν-
   θρώπου.
14 Ἐν τῷ Θεῷ ποιήσομεν δύναμιν· καὶ αὐτὸς ἐξουδενώσει
   τοὺς θλίβοντας ἡμᾶς.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ΡΗʹ. CVIII.**

Εἰς τὸ τέλος, ψαλμὸς τῷ Δαυίδ.
1 Ὁ Θεὸς τὴν αἴνεσίν μου μὴ παρασιωπήσῃς·
2 ὅτι στόμα ἁμαρτωλοῦ καὶ στόμα δολίου ἐπ᾿ ἐμὲ ἠνοίχθη,
   ἐλάλησαν κατ᾿ ἐμοῦ γλώσσῃ δολίᾳ·
3 καὶ λόγοις μίσους ἐκύκλωσάν με,
   καὶ ἐπολέμησάν με δωρεάν.
4 Ἀντὶ τοῦ ἀγαπᾶν με ἐνδιέβαλόν με,
   ἐγὼ δὲ προσηυχόμην·
5 καὶ ἔθεντο κατ᾿ ἐμοῦ κακὰ ἀντὶ ἀγαθῶν,
   καὶ μῖσος ἀντὶ τῆς ἀγαπήσεώς μου.
6 Κατάστησον ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν ἁμαρτωλόν,
   καὶ διάβολος στήτω ἐκ δεξιῶν αὐτοῦ·
7 ἐν τῷ κρίνεσθαι αὐτὸν ἐξέλθοι καταδεδικασμένος,
   καὶ ἡ προσευχὴ αὐτοῦ γενέσθω εἰς ἁμαρτίαν.
8 Γενηθήτωσαν αἱ ἡμέραι αὐτοῦ ὀλίγαι,
   καὶ τὴν ἐπισκοπὴν αὐτοῦ λάβοι ἕτερος·
9 γενηθήτωσαν οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ ὀρφανοί,
   καὶ ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ χήρα·
10 σαλευόμενοι μεταναστήτωσαν οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπαιτησάτωσαν,
    ἐκβληθήτωσαν ἐκ τῶν οἰκοπέδων αὐτῶν.
11 (Καὶ) ἐξερευνησάτω δανειστὴς πάντα ὅσα ὑπάρχει αὐτῷ·
    καὶ διαρπασάτωσαν ἀλλότριοι τοὺς πόνους αὐτοῦ.
12 Μὴ ὑπαρξάτω αὐτῷ ἀντιλήπτωρ,
    μηδὲ γενηθήτω οἰκτίρμων τοῖς ὀρφανοῖς αὐτοῦ·
13 γενηθήτω τὰ τέκνα αὐτοῦ εἰς ἐξόλευσιν,
    ἐν γενεᾷ μιᾷ ἐξαλειφθήτω τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ.
14 Ἀναμνησθείη ἡ ἀνομία τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ ἔναντι Κυρίου,
    καὶ ἡ ἁμαρτία τῆς μητρὸς αὐτοῦ μὴ ἐξαλειφθείη·
15 γενηθήτωσαν ἐναντίον Κυρίου διαπαντὸς,
    καὶ ἐξολεθρευθείη ἐκ γῆς τὸ μνημόσυνον αὐτῶν.
16 Ἀνθ᾿ ὧν οὐκ ἐμνήσθη τοῦ ποιῆσαι ἔλεος,
    καὶ κατεδίωξεν ἄνθρωπον πένητα καὶ πτωχὸν
    καὶ κατανενυγμένον τῇ καρδίᾳ τοῦ θανατῶσαι.
17 Καὶ ἠγάπησε κατάραν, καὶ ἥξει αὐτῷ·
    καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησεν εὐλογίαν, καὶ

**PSALM CVII.**

8 I will be exalted, and I will divide Shechem,
    And the valley of tabernacles will I measure.
9 Mine is Gilead, and mine is Manasseh;
    Ephraim is the help of My head,
    And Judah is My king.
10 Moab is the cauldron of My hope;
    Upon Edom will I cast My sandal,
    And to Me have the foreign peoples been subjected.
11 Who will lead me into a fortified city?
    [Or] who will guide me even unto Edom?
12 Is it not Thou, O God, Who hast cast us off?
    And wilt Thou not go forth, O God, with our armies?
13 Give us help from trouble,
    For vain is the salvation of man.
14 In God shall we do valiantly,
    And He Himself shall bring to nought them that afflict us.

**PSALM CVIII.**

**For the End, a Psalm of David.**
1 O God, keep not silence concerning my praise;
2 For the mouth of the sinner and the mouth of the deceitful man
    Have been opened against me;
    They have spoken against me with a deceitful tongue.
3 And with words of hatred have they encompassed me,
    And they have fought against me without cause.
4 Instead of loving me, they slandered me;
    But I prayed.
5 And they have set evil against me instead of good,
    And hatred instead of my love.
6 Appoint a sinner over him,
    And let an accuser stand at his right hand.
7 When he is judged, let him go forth condemned,
    And let his prayer become sin.
8 Let his days be few,
    And let another take his office.
9 Let his children be orphans,
    And his wife a widow.
10 Let his children wander, removed [from their homes], and beg;
    Let them be cast out from their homesteads.
11 [And] let a creditor search out all that he hath;
    And let strangers plunder his labours.
12 Let there be none to help him,
    Neither let there be one to have compassion upon his orphans.
13 Let his children be for utter destruction;
    In one generation let his name be blotted out.
14 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the Lord,
    And let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.
15 Let them be before the Lord continually,
    And let their memory be utterly destroyed from the earth.
16 Because he remembered not to show mercy,
    But persecuted the poor and needy man,
    And him that was broken in heart, to slay him.
17 And he loved cursing, and it shall come unto him;
    And he desired not blessing, and
