**ΨΑΛΜ. ΚϚ΄. XXVI.** *(continued)*
σοί εἶπεν ἡ καρδία μου. Ἐξεζήτησε σωπόν σου Κύριε ζητήσω.
Μὴ ἀποστ' ἐμοῦ, μὴ ἐκκλίνῃς ἐν ὀργῇ ἀπὸ τοῦ δούλου σου· βοηθός μου γενοῦ,
μὴ ἀποσκορακίσῃς με, καὶ μὴ ἐγκαταλίπῃς με ὁ Θεὸς ὁ σωτήρ μου·
ὅτι ὁ πατήρ μου καὶ ἡ μήτηρ μου ἐγκατέλιπόν με, ὁ δὲ Κύριος προσελάβετό με.
Νομοθέτησόν με Κύριε τῇ ὁδῷ σου, καὶ ὁδήγησόν με ἐν τρίβῳ εὐθείᾳ ἕνεκα τῶν ἐχθρῶν μου.
Μὴ παραδῶς με εἰς ψυχὰς θλιβόντων με· ὅτι ἐπανέστησάν μοι μάρτυρες ἄδικοι, καὶ ἐψεύσατο ἡ ἀδικία ἑαυτῇ.
Πιστεύω τοῦ ἰδεῖν τὰ ἀγαθὰ Κυρίου ἐν γῇ ζώντων. Ὑπόμεινον τὸν Κύριον· ἀνδρίζου, καὶ κραταιούσθω ἡ καρδία σου, καὶ ὑπόμεινον τὸν Κύριον.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ΚΖ´. XXVII.**
ΤΟΥ Δαυίδ.
1 Πρὸς σὲ Κύριε κεκράζομαι, ὁ Θεός μου· μὴ παρασιωπήσῃς ἀπ' ἐμοῦ, μήποτε παρασιωπήσῃς ἀπ' ἐμοῦ, καὶ ὁμοιωθήσομαι τοῖς καταβαίνουσιν εἰς λάκκον.
2 Εἰσάκουσον τῆς φωνῆς τῆς δεήσεώς μου, ἐν τῷ δέεσθαί με πρὸς σὲ, ἐν τῷ αἴρειν με χειράς μου πρὸς ναὸν ἅγιόν σου.
3 Μὴ συνελκύσῃς με μετὰ ἁμαρτωλῶν (τὴν ψυχήν μου), καὶ μετὰ ἐργαζομένων τὴν ἀδικίαν μὴ συναπολέσῃς με, τῶν λαλούντων εἰρήνην μετὰ τῶν πλησίον αὐτῶν, κακὰ δὲ ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις αὐτῶν.
4 Δὸς αὐτοῖς κατὰ τὰ ἔργα αὐτῶν, καὶ κατὰ τὴν πονηρίαν τῶν ἐπιτηδευμάτων αὐτῶν· κατὰ τὰ ἔργα τῶν χειρῶν αὐτῶν δὸς αὐτοῖς, ἀπόδος τὸ ἀνταπόδομα αὐτῶν αὐτοῖς.
5 Ὅτι οὐ συνῆκαν εἰς τὰ ἔργα Κυρίου, καὶ εἰς τὰ ἔργα τῶν χειρῶν αὐτοῦ· καθελεῖς αὐτοὺς, καὶ οὐ μὴ οἰκοδομήσεις αὐτούς.
6 Εὐλογητὸς Κύριος, ὅτι εἰσήκουσε τῆς φωνῆς τῆς δεήσεώς μου.
7 Κύριος βοηθός μου καὶ ὑπερασπιστής μου· ἐπ' αὐτῷ ἤλπισεν ἡ καρδία μου, καὶ ἐβοηθήθην, καὶ ἀνέθαλεν ἡ σάρξ μου· καὶ ἐκ θελήματός μου ἐξομολογήσομαι αὐτῷ.
8 Κύριος κραταίωμα τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὑπερασπιστὴς τῶν σωτηρίων τοῦ χριστοῦ αὐτοῦ ἐστι.
9 Σῶσον τὸν λαόν σου, καὶ εὐλόγησον τὴν κληρονομίαν σου· καὶ ποίμανον αὐτοὺς, καὶ ἔπαρον αὐτοὺς ἕως τοῦ αἰῶνος.

**PSALM XXVI.** *(continued)*

**8** My heart hath said unto Thee: It sought Thy [face]. O Lord, I will seek [it].
**9** Turn not [away] from me; turn not aside in wrath from Thy servant. Be Thou my helper;
**10** neither cast me off, nor forsake me, O God my Saviour.
**11** For my father and my mother have forsaken me, but the Lord hath taken me to Himself.
**12** O Lord, teach me Thy way, and lead me in a straight path, because of mine enemies.
**13** Deliver me not over unto the souls of them that trouble me; for unjust witnesses have risen up against me, and iniquity hath lied to itself.
**14** I believe that I shall see the good things of the Lord in the land of the living. Wait on the Lord; be of good courage, and let thy heart be strengthened, and wait on the Lord.

**PSALM XXVII.**
*A Psalm of David.*

**1** To Thee, O Lord, do I cry, O my God; be not silent from me, lest Thou be silent from me, and I become like them that go down into the pit.
**2** Hearken unto the voice of my supplication, when I pray unto Thee, when I lift up my hands unto Thy holy temple.
**3** Drag not my soul away with sinners, (my soul,) and destroy me not with them that work iniquity, who speak peace with their neighbours, but evil is in their hearts.
**4** Give them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their devices; according to the works of their hands give unto them, render their recompense unto them.
**5** For they have not understood the works of the Lord, nor the works of His hands; Thou shalt pull them down, and not build them up.
**6** Blessed be the Lord, for He hath heard the voice of my supplication.
**7** The Lord is my Helper and my Defender; in Him my heart hath trusted, and I have been helped, and my flesh hath revived; and from my will will I confess unto Him.
**8** The Lord is the strength of His people, and the Defender of the salvations of His Christ.
**9** Save Thy people, and bless Thine inheritance; and shepherd them, and lift them up even unto the age [eternal].
