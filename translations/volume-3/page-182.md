**ἎΣΜΑ ἈΣΜΑΤΩΝ. ΚΕΦ. Δ'.**
**7** τῆς σμύρνης καὶ πρὸς τὸν βουνὸν τοῦ Λιβάνου. Ὅλη καλὴ εἶ πλησίον μου,
**8** καὶ μῶμος οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν σοί. Δεῦρο ἀπὸ Λιβάνου νύμφη, δεῦρο ἀπὸ Λιβάνου· ἐλεύσῃ καὶ διελεύσῃ ἀπ᾿ ἀρχῆς πίστεως, ἀπὸ κεφαλῆς Σανείρ καὶ Ἀερμὼν, ἀπὸ μανδρῶν λεόντων, ἀπὸ ὀρέων
**9** παρδάλεων. Ἐκαρδίωσας ἡμᾶς ἀδελφή μου νύμφη, ἐκαρδίωσας ἡμᾶς ἐν ἑνὶ ἀπὸ ὀφθαλμῶν σου, ἐν μιᾷ ἐνθέματι τραχήλων σου.
**10** Τί ἐκαλλιώθησαν μαστοί σου ἀδελφή μου νύμφη; τί ἐκαλλιώθησαν μαστοί σου ἀπὸ οἴνου, καὶ ὀσμὴ ἱματίων σου ὑπὲρ πάντα τὰ ἀρώματα;
**11** Κηρίον ἀποστάζουσι χείλη σου νύμφη, μέλι καὶ γάλα ὑπὸ τὴν γλῶσσάν σου, καὶ ὀσμὴ ἱματίων σου ὡς ὀσμὴ Λιβάνου.
**12** Κῆπος κεκλεισμένος ἀδελφή μου νύμφη, κῆπος κεκλεισμένος, πηγὴ ἐσφραγισμένη.
**13** Ἀποστολαί σου παράδεισος ῥοῶν μετὰ καρποῦ ἀκροδρύων,
**14** κύπροι μετὰ νάρδων, νάρδος καὶ κρόκος, κάλαμος, καὶ κιννάμωμον μετὰ πάντων ξύλων τοῦ Λιβάνου, σμύρνα Ἀλὼθ μετὰ πάντων
**15** πρώτων μύρων. Πηγὴ κήπων φρέαρ ὕδατος ζῶντος καὶ ῥοιζοῦντος
**16** ἀπὸ τοῦ Λιβάνου. Ἐξεγέρθητι βορρᾶ, καὶ ἔρχου νότε, διάπνευσον κῆπόν μου, καὶ ῥευσάτωσαν ἀρώματά μου. Καταβήτω ἀδελφιδός μου εἰς κῆπον αὐτοῦ, καὶ φαγέτω καρπὸν ἀκροδρύων αὐτοῦ.

**ΚΕΦ. Ε'.**
**1** ΕΙΣΗΛΘΟΝ εἰς κῆπόν μου ἀδελφή μου νύμφη· ἐτρύγησα σμύρναν μου μετὰ ἀρωμάτων μου, ἔφαγον ἀγρόν μου μετὰ μέλιτος μου, ἔπιον οἶνόν μου μετὰ γάλακτός μου· φάγετε οἱ πλησίον, καὶ
**2** πίετε καὶ μεθύσθητε ἀδελφοί. Ἐγὼ καθεύδω, καὶ ἡ καρδία μου ἀγρυπνεῖ· φωνὴ ἀδελφιδοῦ μου, κρούει ἐπὶ τὴν θύραν· ἄνοιξόν μοι ἀδελφή μου, ἡ πλησίον μου, περιστερά μου, τελεία μου· ὅτι ἡ κεφαλή μου ἐπλήσθη δρόσου, καὶ οἱ βόστρυχοί μου ψεκάδων νυκτός.
**3** Ἐξεδυσάμην τὸν χιτῶνά μου, πῶς ἐνδύσωμαι αὐτόν; ἐνιψάμην τοὺς
**4** πόδας μου, πῶς μολυνῶ αὐτούς; Ἀδελφιδός μου ἀπέστειλε χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τῆς ὀπῆς, καὶ ἡ κοιλία μου ἐβοήθη ἐπ᾿ αὐτόν.
**5** Ἀνέστην ἐγὼ ἀνοῖξαι τῷ ἀδελφιδῷ μου· αἱ χεῖρές μου ἔσταξαν σμύρναν,
**6** δάκτυλοί μου σμύρναν πλήρη ἐπὶ χεῖρας τοῦ κλείθρου. Ἤνοιξα ἐγὼ τῷ ἀδελφιδῷ μου· ἀδελφιδός μου παρῆλθεν. Ἡ ψυχή μου ἐξῆλθεν ἐν λόγῳ αὐτοῦ· ἐζήτησα αὐτὸν, καὶ οὐχ εὗρον αὐτόν· ἐκάλεσα αὐτὸν, καὶ οὐκ ἐπήκουσέ μου.

**CHAPTER 4**

**6** ...of myrrh, and to the hill of Lebanon.
**7** Thou art all fair, my beloved,
    and there is no blemish in thee.
**8** Come with me from Lebanon, my bride,
    come with me from Lebanon;
    thou shalt come and pass through
    from the summit of faith,
    from the top of Senir and Hermon,
    from the dens of lions,
    from the mountains of leopards.
**9** Thou hast ravished our heart, my sister, my bride,
    thou hast ravished our heart
    with one [glance] from thine eyes,
    with one chain of thy neck.
**10** How fair are thy breasts, my sister, my bride!
    How much more fair are thy breasts than wine,
    and the scent of thy garments than all spices!
**11** Thy lips, O my bride, drop as the honeycomb;
    honey and milk are under thy tongue;
    and the scent of thy garments
    is as the scent of Lebanon.
**12** A garden enclosed is my sister, my bride;
    a garden enclosed, a fountain sealed.
**13** Thy plantings are a paradise of pomegranates,
    with the fruit of choice trees,
**14** Henna with nards,
    nard and saffron, calamus, and cinnamon,
    with all the trees of Lebanon,
    myrrh and aloes,
    with all the chiefest spices.
**15** A fountain of gardens,
    a well of living waters,
    and streaming down from Lebanon.
**16** Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south wind;
    breathe upon my garden,
    that its spices may flow forth.
    Let my beloved come into his garden,
    and eat his choice fruits.

**CHAPTER 5**

**1** I am come into my garden, my sister, my bride;
    I have gathered my myrrh with my spices,
    I have eaten my field with my honey,
    I have drunk my wine with my milk.
    Eat, O friends; drink,
    yea, drink abundantly, O brethren.
**2** I sleep, but my heart waketh;
    it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh at the door:
    "Open to me, my sister, my beloved,
    my dove, my perfect one;
    for my head is filled with dew,
    and my locks with the drops of night."
**3** I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on?
    I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?
**4** My beloved put in his hand
    by the hole [of the door],
    and my inmost being yearned for him.
**5** I rose up to open to my beloved;
    and my hands dropped with myrrh,
    and my fingers with liquid myrrh
    upon the handles of the lock.
**6** I opened to my beloved;
    but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone.
    My soul failed at his word;
    I sought him, but I found him not;
    I called him, but he answered me not.
