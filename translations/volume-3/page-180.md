ΚΕΦ. Β΄. II.

1 Ἐγὼ ἄνθος τοῦ πεδίου, κρίνον τῶν κοιλάδων.
2 Ὡς κρίνον ἐν μέσῳ ἀκανθῶν, οὕτως ἡ πλησίον μου ἀναμέσον τῶν θυγατέρων.
3 Ὡς μῆλον ἐν τοῖς ξύλοις τοῦ δρυμοῦ, οὕτως ἀδελφιδός μου ἀναμέσον τῶν υἱῶν· ἐν τῇ σκιᾷ αὐτοῦ ἐπεθύμησα καὶ ἐκάθισα, καὶ
4 καρπὸς αὐτοῦ γλυκὺς ἐν λάρυγγί μου. Εἰσαγάγετέ με εἰς οἶκον
5 τοῦ οἴνου, τάξατε ἐπ᾿ ἐμὲ ἀγάπην· στηρίσατέ με ἐν ἀμόραις, στοι-
6 βάσατέ με ἐν μήλοις· ὅτι τετρωμένη ἀγάπης ἐγώ. Εὐώνυμος αὐτοῦ ὑπὸ τὴν κεφαλήν μου, καὶ ἡ δεξιὰ αὐτοῦ περιλήψεται με.
7 Ὥρκισα ὑμᾶς θυγατέρες Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐν ταῖς δυνάμεσι καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἰσχύσεσι τοῦ ἀγροῦ· ἐὰν ἐγείρητε καὶ ἐξεγείρητε τὴν ἀγάπην, ἕως
8 οὗ θελήσῃ. Φωνὴ ἀδελφιδοῦ μου· ἰδοὺ οὗτος ἥκει πηδῶν ἐπὶ τὰ
9 ὄρη, διαλλόμενος ἐπὶ τοὺς βουνούς· ὅμοιός ἐστιν ἀδελφιδός μου τῇ δορκάδι ἢ νεβρῷ ἐλάφων ἐπὶ τὰ ὄρη Βαιθήλ. Ἰδοὺ οὗτος ἔστηκεν ὀπίσω τοῦ τοίχου ἡμῶν, παρακύπτων διὰ τῶν θυρίδων, ἐκκύπτων
10 διὰ τῶν δικτυωτῶν. Ἀποκρίνεται ἀδελφιδός μου, καὶ λέγει μοι· ἀνά-
11 στα, ἐλθὲ ἡ πλησίον μου, καλή μου, περιστερά μου· ὅτι ἰδοὺ ὁ χει-
12 μὼν παρῆλθεν, ὁ ὑετὸς ἀπῆλθεν, ἐπορεύθη ἑαυτῷ· τὰ ἄνθη ὤφθη ἐν τῇ γῇ, καιρὸς τῆς τομῆς ἔφθακεν, φωνὴ τῆς τρυγόνος ἠκούσθη
13 ἐν τῇ γῇ ἡμῶν· ἡ συκῆ ἐξήνεγκεν ὀλύνθους αὐτῆς, αἱ ἄμπελοι κυπρίζουσιν, ἔδωκαν ὀσμήν. Ἀνάστα, ἐλθὲ ἡ πλησίον μου, καλή μου,
14 περιστερά μου, καὶ ἐλθέ σοι περιστερά μου ἐν σκέπῃ τῆς πέτρας, ἐχόμενα τοῦ προτειχίσματος· δεῖξόν μοι τὴν ὄψιν σου, καὶ ἀκούτισόν με τὴν φωνήν σου· ὅτι ἡ φωνή σου ἡδεῖα, καὶ ἡ ὄψις σου
15 ὡραία. Πιάσατε ἡμῖν ἀλώπεκας μικρούς, ἀφανίζοντας ἀμπελῶνας· καὶ αἱ ἄμπελοι ἡμῶν κυπρίζουσιν.
16 Ἀδελφιδός μου ἐμοί, κἀγὼ αὐτῷ, ὁ ποιμαίνων ἐν τοῖς κρίνοις,
17 ἕως οὗ διαπνεύσῃ ἡ ἡμέρα, καὶ κινηθῶσιν αἱ σκιαί. Ἀπόστρεψον, ὁμοιώθητι σὺ ἀδελφιδέ μου τῷ δόρκωνι ἢ νεβρῷ ἐλάφων ἐπὶ ὄρη κοιλωμάτων.

ΚΕΦ. Γ΄. III.

1 Ἐπὶ κοίτην μου ἐν νυξὶν ἐζήτησα ὃν ἠγάπησεν ἡ ψυχή μου· ἐζήτησα αὐτόν, καὶ οὐχ εὗρον αὐτόν· ἐκάλεσα αὐτόν, καὶ οὐχ ὑπήκουσέ μου.

**THE SONG OF SONGS.**

**CHAPTER 2**

**1** I am the flower of the plain,
    [and] the lily of the valleys.
**2** As the lily among the thorns,
    so is my beloved among the daughters.
**3** As the apple tree among the trees of the forest,
    so is my beloved among the sons.
    Beneath his shadow I longed to sit,
    and there I rested;
    and his fruit was sweet unto my throat.
**4** Bring ye me into the house of wine,
    [and] array me with love.
**5** Sustain me with mulberries,
    refresh me with apples;
    for I am wounded with love.
**6** His left hand is beneath my head,
    and his right hand shall embrace me.
**7** I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
    by the powers and by the strengths of the field,
    that ye stir not up, nor awaken love,
    until it pleaseth [Him].
**8** The voice of my beloved!
    Behold, he cometh, leaping upon the mountains,
    bounding over the hills.
**9** My beloved is like a gazelle,
    or a fawn of the deer,
    upon the mountains of Bethel.
    Behold, he standeth behind our wall,
    peering through the windows,
    [and] looking forth through the lattices.
**10** My beloved answereth and saith unto me:
    Arise, come, my beloved, my fair one, my dove;
**11** For behold, the winter is past,
    the rain hath departed, [and] hath gone its way;
**12** The flowers have appeared upon the earth,
    the time of the pruning hath arrived,
    [and] the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land;
**13** The fig tree hath put forth her early figs,
    the vines are fragrant and give forth their scent.
    Arise, come, my beloved, my fair one, my dove,
**14** Yea, come, my dove,
    [thou that art] in the shelter of the rock,
    close by the rampart.
    Show me thy countenance,
    and let me hear thy voice;
    for thy voice is sweet,
    and thy countenance is comely.
**15** Catch for us the little foxes
    that spoil the vineyards;
    and our vines are fragrant.
**16** My beloved is mine, and I am his;
    he feedeth among the lilies.
**17** Until the day breatheth through,
    and the shadows do lengthen.
    Turn back, be thou likened, O my beloved,
    to a gazelle or a fawn of the deer
    upon the mountains of the hollows.

**CHAPTER 3**

**1** Upon my bed by night
    I sought him whom my soul loveth;
    I sought him, but I found him not;
    I called him, yet he answered me not.
