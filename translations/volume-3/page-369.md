ΚΕΦ. ΜΘ΄. ΙΕΡΕΜΙΑΣ 1307
τούτων· ὅτι κατελείφθημεν ὀλίγοι ἀπὸ πολλῶν, καθώς οἱ ὀφθαλμοί
σου βλέπουσι. Καὶ ἀπαγγειλάτω ἡμῖν Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου τὴν 3
ὁδὸν, ἐν ᾗ πορευσόμεθα ἐν αὐτῇ, καὶ λόγον ὃν ποιήσομεν. Καὶ 4
εἶπεν αὐτοῖς Ἱερεμίας ὁ προφήτης· ἤκουσα, ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ προσεύξομαι
πρὸς Κύριον τὸν Θεὸν ὑμῶν, κατὰ τοὺς λόγους ὑμῶν· καὶ ἔσται ὃ
λόγον ὃν ἀποκριθήσεται Κύριος, ἀναγγελῶ ὑμῖν, οὐ μὴ κρύψω ἀφ’
ὑμῶν ῥῆμα. Καὶ αὐτοὶ εἶπαν τῷ Ἱερεμίᾳ· ἔστω Κύριος ἐν ἡμῖν 5
εἰς μάρτυρα δίκαιον καὶ πιστὸν, εἰ μὴ κατὰ πάντα τὸν λόγον,
ὃν ἀποστείλῃ σε Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου πρὸς ἡμᾶς, οὕτως ποιήσωμεν.
Καὶ ἐὰν ἀγαθὸν, καὶ ἐὰν κακὸν, τὴν φωνὴν Κυρίου τοῦ 6
Θεοῦ ἡμῶν, οὗ ἡμεῖς ἀποστέλλομεν σε πρὸς αὐτὸν, ἀκουσόμεθα,
ἵνα βέλτιον ἡμῖν γένηται, ὅτι ἀκουσόμεθα τῆς φωνῆς Κυρίου τοῦ
Θεοῦ ἡμῶν. Καὶ ἐγενήθη μεθ’ ἡμέρας δέκα, ἐγενήθη λόγος Κυρίου 7
πρὸς Ἱερεμίαν. Καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸν Ἰωάναν υἱὸν Καριὲ, καὶ 8
πάντας τοὺς ἡγεμόνας τῆς δυνάμεως τοὺς μετ’ αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντα
τὸν λαὸν ἀπὸ μικροῦ καὶ ἕως μεγάλου, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· οὕτως εἶπε 9
Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραὴλ, πρὸς ὃν ἀπεστείλατέ με, ῥῖψαι ἔλεον ὑμῶν
ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ· ἐὰν καθίσαντες καθιστήσεται τῇ γῇ ταύτῃ, οἰκοδομήσω 10
ὑμᾶς, καὶ οὐ μὴ καθελῶ, καὶ φυτεύσω ὑμᾶς, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἐκτίλω, ὅτι
ἀναπέπαυμαι ἐπὶ τοῖς κακοῖς οἷς ἐποίησα ὑμῖν. Μὴ φοβηθῆτε ἀπὸ προσώπου 11
βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος, οὗ ὑμεῖς φοβεῖσθε· ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ
μὴ φοβηθῆτε, φησὶ Κύριος, ὅτι μεθ’ ὑμῶν ἐγώ εἰμι, τοῦ ἐξαιρεῖσθαι
ὑμᾶς, καὶ σώζειν ὑμᾶς ἐκ χειρὸς αὐτοῦ. Καὶ δώσω ὑμῖν ἔλεος, 12
καὶ ἐλεήσω ὑμᾶς, καὶ ἐπιστρέψω ὑμᾶς εἰς τὴν γῆν ὑμῶν. Καὶ 13
εἰ λέγετε ὑμεῖς, οὐ μὴ καθίσωμεν ἐν τῇ γῇ ταύτῃ, πρὸς τὸ μὴ
ἀκοῦσαι φωνῆς Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ὑμῶν, λέγοντες· οὐχὶ, ὅτι εἰς γῆν 14
Αἰγύπτου εἰσελευσόμεθα, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἴδωμεν πόλεμον, καὶ φωνὴν σάλπιγγος
οὐ μὴ ἀκούσομεν, καὶ ἐν ἄρτοις οὐ μὴ πεινάσωμεν, καὶ ἐκεῖ
οἰκήσομεν. Διὰ τοῦτο ἀκούσατε λόγον Κυρίου οἱ κατάλοιποι τῆς γῆς· 15
οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος· ἐὰν ὑμεῖς δόντες δῶτε τὸ πρόσωπον ὑμῶν εἰσελθεῖν
εἰς Αἴγυπτον, καὶ εἰσέλθητε ἐκεῖ κατοικεῖν, καὶ ἔσται, ἡ ῥομφαία, 16
ἣν ὑμεῖς φοβεῖσθε ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτῆς, ἐκεῖ εὑρήσει ὑμᾶς ἐν
τῇ Αἰγύπτῳ, καὶ ὁ λιμὸς οὗ ὑμεῖς λόγον ἔχετε ἀπὸ προσώπου
αὐτοῦ, καταλήψεται ὑμᾶς ὀπίσω ὑμῶν ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ, καὶ ἐκεῖ
ἀποθανεῖσθε. Καὶ ἔσονται πάντες οἱ ἄνθρωποι, καὶ πάντες οἱ 17
ἀλλογενεῖς, οἱ θέντες τὸ πρόσωπον αὑτῶν εἰσελθεῖν εἰς γῆν Αἰ-

**JEREMIAH 49**

**2** ...concerning this remnant; for we are left but a few out of many, as thine eyes do behold. And let the Lord thy God declare unto us the way wherein we shall walk, and the word which we shall do.
**4** Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard you; behold, I will pray unto the Lord your God according to your words; and whatsoever word the Lord shall answer, I will declare it unto you; I will not hide a word from you.
**5** And they said unto Jeremiah, Let the Lord be a righteous and faithful witness between us, if we do not according to all the word which the Lord thy God shall send thee unto us.
**6** Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will hearken unto the voice of the Lord our God, unto whom we send thee; that it may be well with us, because we will hearken unto the voice of the Lord our God.
**7** And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah.
**8** Then he called Johanan the son of Karie, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, and all the people from the least even unto the greatest,
**9** and said unto them, Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, unto whom ye sent me to cast your [plea for] mercy before Him: If ye do indeed dwell in this land, then will I build you, and not pull you down; and I will plant you, and not pluck you up: for I have relented concerning the evils which I have done unto you.
**11** Fear ye not the presence of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; fear ye not his presence, saith the Lord: for I am with you to deliver you, and to save you from his hand.
**12** And I will show you mercy, and I will have mercy upon you, and will bring you again unto your own land.
**13** But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, so as not to hear the voice of the Lord our God, saying, No, but we will go into the land of Egypt,
**14** and we shall not see war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, neither shall we hunger for bread; and there will we dwell.
**15** Therefore hear the word of the Lord, ye remnant of the land; Thus saith the Lord; If ye do indeed set your face to enter into Egypt, and go thither to sojourn,
**16** then shall the sword, which ye fear from its presence, there find you in the land of Egypt; and the famine, whereof ye are concerned from its presence, shall overtake you behind you in Egypt; and there shall ye die.
**17** And all the men shall be, even all the strangers, who set their face to enter into the land of Egypt.
