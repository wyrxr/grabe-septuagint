ΚΕΦ. Ηʹ. Θʹ. ZAXAPIAΣ. 1521
καὶ κατισχύετε ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν ὑμῶν. Διότι τάδε λέγει Κύριος 14
παντοκράτωρ· ὅν τρόπον διενοήθην τοῦ κακῶσαι ὑμᾶς ἐν τῷ παροργίσαι
με τοὺς πατέρας ὑμῶν, λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ, καὶ οὐ μετενόησα·
οὕτως παρατέταγμαι, καὶ διανενόημαι ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ταύταις, 15
τοῦ καλῶς ποιῆσαι τὴν Ἱερουσαλὴμ καὶ τὸν οἶκον Ἰούδα· θαρσεῖτε.
Οὗτοι οἱ λόγοι οὓς ποιήσετε· λαλεῖτε ἀλήθειαν ἕκαστος πρὸς τὸν 16
πλησίον αὐτοῦ, ἀλήθειαν καὶ κρίμα εἰρηνικὸν κρίνετε ἐν ταῖς πύλαις
ὑμῶν, καὶ ἕκαστος τὴν κακίαν τοῦ πλησίον αὐτοῦ μὴ λογίζεσθε ἐν 17
ταῖς καρδίαις ὑμῶν, καὶ ὅρκον ψευδῆ μὴ ἀγαπᾶτε· διότι ταῦτα πάντα
ἐμίσησα, λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ. Καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου 18
παντοκράτορος πρὸς μέ, λέγων· τάδε λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ·
νηστεία ἡ τετράς, καὶ νηστεία ἡ πέμπτη, καὶ νηστεία ἡ ἑβδόμη, 19
καὶ νηστεία ἡ δεκάτη ἔσονται τῷ οἴκῳ Ἰούδα εἰς χαρὰν καὶ εἰς
εὐφροσύνην, καὶ εἰς ἑορτὰς ἀγαθάς, καὶ εὐφρανθήσεσθε· καὶ τὴν 20
ἀλήθειαν καὶ τὴν εἰρήνην ἀγαπήσατε. Τάδε λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ·
ἔτι ἥξουσι λαοὶ πολλοί, καὶ κατοικοῦντες πόλεις πολλάς, καὶ 21
συνελεύσονται κατοικοῦντες πέντε πόλεις εἰς πόλιν μίαν, λέγοντες·
πορευθῶμεν δεηθῆναι τοῦ προσώπου Κυρίου, καὶ ἐκζητῆσαι τὸ πρόσωπον
Κυρίου παντοκράτορος, πορεύσομαι κἀγώ· καὶ ἥξουσι λαοὶ πολλοὶ 22
καὶ ἔθνη πολλὰ ἐκζητῆσαι τὸ πρόσωπον Κυρίου παντοκράτορος
ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ τοῦ ἐξιλάσκεσθαι τὸ πρόσωπον Κυρίου. Τάδε 23
λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ· ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις ἐὰν ἐπιλάβωνται
δέκα ἄνδρες ἐκ πασῶν τῶν γλωσσῶν τῶν ἐθνῶν, καὶ ἐπιλάβωνται τοῦ
κρασπέδου ἀνδρὸς Ἰουδαίου, λέγοντες· πορευσομεθα μετὰ σοῦ, διότι
ἀκηκόαμεν, ὅτι Θεὸς μεθ᾽ ὑμῶν ἐστιν.

ΚΕΦ. Θʹ. IX.

ΛΗΜΜΑ λόγου Κυρίου ἐν γῇ Σεδράχ, καὶ Δαμασκοῦ θυσίας αὐτοῦ, 1
διότι Κύριος ἐφορᾷ ἀνθρώπους, καὶ πάσας φυλὰς τοῦ Ἰσραήλ.
Καὶ Ἡμὰθ ἐν τοῖς ὁρίοις αὐτῆς, Τύρος καὶ Σιδῶν, διότι ἐφρόνησαν 2
σφόδρα· καὶ ᾠκοδόμησε Τύρος ὀχυρώματα ἑαυτῇ, καὶ ἐθησαύρισεν 3
ἀργύριον ὡς χοῦν, καὶ συνήγαγε χρυσίον ὡς πηλὸν ὁδῶν. Διὰ 4
τοῦτο Κύριος κληρονομήσει αὐτήν, καὶ πατάξει εἰς θάλασσαν τὴν
δύναμιν αὐτῆς, καὶ αὕτη ἐν πυρὶ καταναλωθήσεται.

**Zechariah [Chapter] 8.**

...and strengthen ye your hands.
**14** For thus saith the Lord Almighty: In the manner that I purposed to bring evil upon you, when your fathers did provoke Me to wrath, saith the Lord Almighty, and I did not repent;
**15** even so have I now purposed and resolved in these days to do good unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Fear ye not.
**16** These are the things which ye shall do: Speak ye truth, every man to his neighbour; render true and peaceful judgment in your gates;
**17** and let none of you devise evil in his heart against his neighbour; and love no false oath; for all these things I do hate, saith the Lord Almighty.

**18** And the word of the Lord Almighty came unto me, saying,
**19** "Thus saith the Lord Almighty: The fast of the fourth [month], and the fast of the fifth [month], and the fast of the seventh [month], and the fast of the tenth [month] shall be to the house of Judah for joy, and for gladness, and for goodly feasts; and ye shall rejoice,
**20** and love ye the truth and the peace." Thus saith the Lord Almighty: There shall yet come many peoples, and the inhabitants of many cities,
**21** and the inhabitants of five cities shall gather together into one city, saying, "Let us go to entreat the favour of the Lord, and to seek out the face of the Lord Almighty." [And one shall say,] "I too will go!"
**22** And many peoples and mighty nations shall come to seek out the face of the Lord Almighty in Jerusalem, and to entreat the favour of the Lord.
**23** Thus saith the Lord Almighty: In those days it shall come to pass, that ten men from all the languages of the nations shall take hold, and shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, "We will go with thee; for we have heard that God is with you."

**Zechariah [Chapter] 9.**

**1** The burden of the word of the Lord in the land of Hadrach, and of Damascus, [even] her sacrifices; for the Lord looketh upon men, and upon all the tribes of Israel.
**2** And Hamath also [shall be included] in her borders, Tyre and Sidon, because they were exceedingly wise;
**3** and Tyre built herself strongholds, and heaped up silver as the dust, and gathered gold as the mire of the streets.
**4** Therefore the Lord shall inherit her, and shall smite her power into the sea; and she herself shall be consumed by fire.
