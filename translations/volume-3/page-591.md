ΜΑΛΑΧΙΑΣ Α΄.
ΚΕΦΑΛΑΙΟΝ Α΄.
1 ΔΗΜΜΑ λόγου Κυρίου ἐπὶ τὸν Ἰσραὴλ ἐν χειρὶ ἀγγέλου
   αὐτοῦ· θέσθε δὴ ἐπὶ τὰς καρδίας ὑμῶν.
2 Ἠγάπησα ὑμᾶς, λέγει Κύριος. Καὶ εἴπατε· ἐν τίνι ἠγάπησας ἡμᾶς;
   οὐκ ἀδελφὸς ἦν Ἡσαῦ τοῦ Ἰακώβ; λέγει Κύριος· καὶ ἠγάπησα
   τὸν Ἰακώβ, τὸν δὲ Ἠσαῦ ἐμίσησα, καὶ ἔταξα τὰ ὄρια αὐτοῦ
3  εἰς ἀφανισμόν, καὶ τὴν κληρονομίαν αὐτοῦ εἰς δώματα ἐρήμου.
4 Διότι ἐρεῖ ἡ Ἰδουμαία κατέστραπται, καὶ ἐπιστρέψωμεν, καὶ ἀνοικο-
   δομήσωμεν τὰς ἠρημωμένας. Τάδε λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ·
   αὐτοὶ οἰκοδομήσουσι, καὶ ἐγὼ καταστρέψω· καὶ ἐπικληθήσεται
   αὐτοῖς ὄρια ἀνομίας, καὶ λαὸς ἐφ᾿ ὃν παρετάκταται Κύριος ἕως
   αἰῶνος.
5 Καὶ οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ ὑμῶν ὄψονται, καὶ ὑμεῖς ἐρεῖτε· ἐμεγαλύνθη
   Κύριος ὑπεράνω τῶν ὁρίων τοῦ Ἰσραήλ.
6 Υἱὸς δοξάζει πατέρα, καὶ δοῦλος τὸν Κύριον αὐτοῦ· καὶ εἰ πατὴρ
   εἰμὶ ἐγώ, ποῦ ἐστιν ἡ δόξα μου; καὶ εἰ Κύριος εἰμὶ ἐγώ, ποῦ
   ἐστιν ὁ φόβος μου; λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ· ὑμῖν οἱ ἱερεῖς
   οἱ φαυλίζοντες τὸ ὄνομά μου.
7 Καὶ εἴπατε· ἐν τίνι ἐφαυλίσαμεν τὸ ὄνομά σου ; Προσάγοντες
   πρὸς τὸ θυσιαστήριόν μου ἄρτους ἠλισγημένους. Καὶ εἴπατε·
   ἐν τίνι ἠλισγήσαμεν αὐτούς; ἐν τῷ λέγειν ὑμᾶς, τράπεζα Κυρίου
   ἠλισγημένη ἐστὶ, καὶ τὰ ἐπιτιθέμενα βρώματα ἐξουδενωμένα.
8 Διότι ἐὰν προσάγαγητε τυφλὸν εἰς θυσίαν, οὐ κακόν; καὶ ἐὰν
   προσάγαγητε χωλὸν ἢ ἀῤῥωστον, οὐ κακόν; προσάγαγε δὴ αὐτὸ
   τῷ ἡγουμένῳ σου, εἰ προσδέξεται σε, εἰ λήψεται πρόσωπόν σου,
   λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ.
9 Καὶ νῦν ἐξιλάσκεσθε τὸ πρόσωπον τοῦ Θεοῦ ὑμῶν, καὶ δεήθητε
   αὐτοῦ. Ἐν χερσὶν ὑμῶν γέγονε ταῦτα· εἰ λήψομαι ἐξ ὑμῶν
   πρόσωπα ὑμῶν, λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ;
10 Διότι καὶ ἐν ὑμῖν συγκλεισθήσονται θύραι, καὶ οὐκ ἀνάψεται
    τὸ θυσιαστήριόν μου δωρεάν· οὐκ ἔστι μου θέλημα ἐν ὑμῖν,
    λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ, θυσίαν οὐ προσδέξομαι ἐκ τῶν χει-
11 ρῶν ὑμῶν. Διότι ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν ἡλίου καὶ ἕως δυσμῶν τὸ ὄνο-
    μά μου δεδόξασται ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι, καὶ ἐν παντὶ τόπῳ θυμία-
    μα προσάγεται ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί μου, καὶ θυσία καθαρά· διότι
    μέγα τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι, λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ.
12 Ὑμεῖς δὲ βεβηλοῦτε αὐτὸ ἐν τῷ λέγειν ὑμᾶς· τράπεζα Κυρίου
    ἠλισγημένη ἐστὶ, καὶ τὰ ἐπιτιθέμενα ἐξουδενῶνται βρώματα
    αὐτοῦ.
13 Καὶ εἴπατε· ταῦτα ἐκ κακοπαθείας ἐστὶ, καὶ ἐξεφυσήσατε
    αὐτά, λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ· καὶ εἰσεφέρετε τὰ ἁρπάγματα,
    καὶ τὰ χωλὰ, καὶ τὰ ἐνοχλούμενα· καὶ ἐὰν φέρητε τὴν θυσίαν,
    εἰ προσδέξομαι αὐτὰ ἐκ τῶν χειρῶν ὑμῶν, λέγει Κύριος παντο-
    κράτωρ.
14 Καὶ ἐπικατάρατος, ὃς ἦν δυνατὸς, καὶ ὑπῆρχεν αὐτῷ ἐν τῷ ποι-
    μνίῳ αὐτοῦ ἄρσεν, καὶ εὐχὴ αὐτοῦ ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ, καὶ θύει διεφθαρμένον
    τῷ Κυρίῳ· διότι μέγας βασιλεὺς ἐγώ εἰμι, λέγει Κύριος παντο-
    κράτωρ, καὶ τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐπιφανὲς ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι.

**Malachi [Chapter] 1**

**1** The Oracle of the word of the LORD upon Israel by the hand of His angel: Set [this] now upon your hearts.
**2** “I have loved you,” saith the LORD. Yet ye say, “Wherein hast Thou loved us?” “Was not Esau Jacob’s brother?” saith the LORD: “Yet I loved Jacob,
**3** but Esau I hated, and I laid waste his borders unto desolation, and his inheritance for the dwellings of the wilderness.”
**4** For if Edom shall say, “We are utterly broken, yet will we return and rebuild the desolate places,” thus saith the LORD Almighty: “They shall indeed build, but I will tear down; and they shall be called, ‘The borders of wickedness,’ and ‘The people against whom the LORD has arrayed Himself forever.’”
**5** And your eyes shall behold [it], and ye shall say, “The LORD is magnified beyond the borders of Israel.”
**6** A son honors his father, and a servant his master. If then I be a Father, where is Mine honor? And if I be a Master, where is My fear? saith the LORD Almighty, unto you, O priests, that scorn My Name.
**7** And ye say, “Wherein have we scorned Thy Name?” By offering defiled bread upon Mine altar. And ye say, “Wherein have we defiled it?” In that ye say, “The table of the LORD is defiled, and the food set thereupon is despised.”
**8** For if ye bring the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? And if ye bring the lame or the sick, is it not evil? Present it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee? Or will he accept thy person? saith the LORD Almighty.
**9** And now, I pray you, seek to appease the face of your God, and supplicate Him. By your hands have these things been done: will I accept the persons of you? saith the LORD Almighty.
**10** For among you, even the doors shall be shut, and My altar shall not be kindled for nought. I have no pleasure in you, saith the LORD Almighty, neither will I accept an offering from your hands.
**11** For from the rising of the sun even unto its setting, My Name has been glorified among the nations; and in every place incense is offered unto My Name, and a pure sacrifice: for great is My Name among the nations, saith the LORD Almighty.
**12** But ye profane it, in that ye say, “The table of the LORD is defiled; and its food, which is set thereupon, is despised.”
**13** And ye say, “Behold, what a weariness is this!” And ye disdain them, saith the LORD Almighty; and ye bring the plundered, and the lame, and the vexed; and if ye offer such as a sacrifice, shall I accept it from your hands? saith the LORD Almighty.
**14** Yea, cursed is he that is mighty, and has in his flock a male [animal], and his vow is upon it, yet sacrifices unto the LORD that which is corrupted; for I am a great King, saith the LORD Almighty, and My Name is manifest among the nations.
