ΚΕΦ. Ηʹ. Θʹ. ΔΑΝΙΗΛ. 1443
τὴν ὅρασιν, καὶ ἐζήτουν σύνεσιν, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἔστη ἐνώπιον ἐμοῦ,
ὡς ὅρασις ἀνδρός, καὶ ἤκουσα φωνὴν ἀνδρὸς ἀναμέσον τοῦ Οὐβάλ, 16
καὶ ἐκάλεσε, καὶ εἶπε, Γαβριήλ, συνέτισον ἐκεῖνον τὴν ὅρασιν.
Καὶ ἦλθε, καὶ ἔστη ἐχόμενα τῆς στάσεώς μου· καὶ ἐν τῷ ἐλθεῖν 17
αὐτὸν ἐθαμβήθην, καὶ πίπτω ἐπὶ πρόσωπόν μου· καὶ εἶπε πρός
μέ· σύνες υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου· ἔτι γὰρ εἰς καιροῦ πέρας ἡ ὅρασις. Καὶ 18
ἐν τῷ λαλεῖν αὐτὸν μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ, ἐθαμβήθην καὶ πίπτω ἐπὶ προσώ-
πόν μου ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, καὶ ἥψατό μου, καὶ ἔστησέ με ἐπὶ πόδας
μου, καὶ εἶπέ μοι· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ γνωρίζω σοι τὰ ἐσόμενα ἐπ᾿ ἐσχά- 19
του τῆς ὀργῆς· ἔτι γὰρ εἰς καιροῦ πέρας ἡ ὅρασις. Ὁ χριὸς ὃν 20
εἶδες, ὁ ἔχων τὰ κέρατα, βασιλεὺς Περσῶν καὶ Μήδων. Καὶ ὁ 21
τράγος τῶν αἰγῶν, βασιλεὺς Ἑλλήνων· καὶ τὸ κέρας τὸ μέγα ὃ
ἦν ἀναμέσον τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν αὐτοῦ, αὐτός ἐστιν ὁ βασιλεὺς ὁ
πρῶτος. Καὶ τοῦ συντριβέντος οὗ ἔστησαν ὑποκάτω τέσσαρα 22
κέρατα, τέσσαρες βασιλεῖς ἐκ τοῦ ἔθνους αὐτοῦ ἀναστήσονται, καὶ
οὐκ ἐν τῇ ἰσχύϊ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐπ᾿ ἐσχάτῳ τῆς βασιλείας αὐτῶν, 23
πληρουμένων τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν αὐτῶν, ἀναστήσεται βασιλεὺς ἀναι-
δὴς προσώπῳ, καὶ συνιῶν προβλήματα, καὶ κραταιὰ ἡ ἰσχὺς 24
αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἐν τῇ ἰσχύϊ αὐτοῦ, καὶ θαυμαστὰ διαφθερεῖ, καὶ
κατευθυνεῖ, καὶ ποιήσει, καὶ διαφθερεῖ ἰσχυρούς, καὶ λαὸν ἅγιον.
Καὶ ὁ ζυγὸς τοῦ κλοιοῦ αὐτοῦ κατευθυνεῖ· δόλος ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐ- 25
τοῦ, καὶ ἐν καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ μεγαλυνθήσεται, καὶ δόλῳ διαφθερεῖ
πολλούς, καὶ ἐπὶ ἀπωλείας πολλῶν στήσεται· καὶ ὡς ᾠὰ χειρὶ
συντρίψει. Καὶ ἡ ὅρασις τῆς ἑσπέρας καὶ τῆς πρωϊνῆς τῆς ῥη- 26
θείσης ἀληθής ἐστι. Καὶ σὺ σφράγισον τὴν ὅρασιν, ὅτι εἰς ἡμέ-
ρας πολλὰς. Καὶ ἐγὼ Δανιὴλ ἐκοιμήθην καὶ ἐμαλακίσθην, καὶ 27
ἀνέστην, καὶ ἐποίουν τὰ ἔργα τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ ἐθαύμαζον τὴν
ὅρασιν, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ συνιῶν.

**8:15** the vision, and I sought understanding, and, behold, there stood before me one as the appearance of a man.
**16** And I heard a man's voice between the Ulai, and he called, and said, Gabriel, make that one understand the vision.
**17** So he came and stood close unto where I stood; and when he came, I was dismayed and fell upon my face; and he said unto me, Understand, O son of man; for yet the vision pertaineth to the end of time.
**18** And as he spake with me, I was terrified and fell upon my face to the ground; and he touched me, and set me upright upon my feet.
**19** And he said unto me, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the uttermost end of the wrath; for yet the vision pertaineth to the end of time.
**20** The ram which thou sawest, having the horns, is the king of the Persians and Medes.
**21** And the he-goat of the goats is the king of the Greeks; and the great horn that was betwixt his eyes, he is the first king.
**22** And as for that which was broken, whereupon stood four horns, four kings shall rise up out of his nation, but not in his strength.
**23** And at the latter end of their kingdom, when their transgressions are come to the full, there shall rise up a king of fierce countenance, and understanding riddles.
**24** And his strength shall be mighty, but not by his own power; and he shall destroy wondrous things, and he shall prosper, and shall act, and he shall destroy mighty ones, and the holy people.
**25** And the yoke of his chain shall prosper; deceit shall be in his hand, and in his heart shall he magnify himself, and by deceit shall he destroy many; and he shall stand against the destruction of many; and as eggs by hand shall he crush them.
**26** And the vision of the evening and the morning which was spoken is true; and thou, seal up the vision, for it is for many days.
**27** And I, Daniel, slept and was faint, and I rose up, and did the king's business; and I wondered at the vision, but none understood it.
