τοῦ νότου συνάψει πόλεμον καὶ ἐν δυνάμει μεγάλῃ καὶ ἰσχυρᾷ
σφόδρα, καὶ οὐ στήσονται, ὅτι λογιοῦνται ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸν λογισμούς,
26 καὶ φάγονται τὰ δέοντα αὐτοῦ, καὶ συντρίψουσιν αὐτόν, καὶ δυ-
27 νάμεις κατακλύσει, καὶ πεσοῦνται τραυματίαι πολλοί. Καὶ ἀμ-
φότεροι οἱ βασιλεῖς, αἱ καρδίαι αὐτῶν εἰς πονηρίαν, καὶ ἐπὶ
τραπέζῃ μιᾷ ψευδῆ λαλήσουσι, καὶ οὐ κατευθυνεῖ, ὅτι ἔτι πέρας
28 εἰς καιρόν, καὶ ἐπιστρέψει εἰς τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ ἐν ὑπάρξει πολλῇ,
καὶ ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ διαθήκην ἁγίαν, καὶ ποιήσει, καὶ ἐπι-
29 στρέψει εἰς τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ. Εἰς τὸν καιρὸν ἐπιστρέφει, καὶ ἥξει
30 ἐν τῷ νότῳ, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ὡς ἡ πρώτη καὶ ὡς ἡ ἐσχάτη. Καὶ εἰσ-
ελεύσονται (οἱ) ἐν αὐτῷ (καὶ) οἱ ἐκπορευόμενοι κίτιοι, καὶ τα-
πεινωθήσεται, καὶ ἐπιστρέψει, καὶ θυμωθήσεται ἐπὶ διαθήκην ἀ-
γίαν· καὶ ποιήσει, καὶ ἐπιστρέψει, καὶ συνήσει ἐπὶ τοὺς κατα-
31 λείποντας διαθήκην ἁγίαν. Καὶ βραχίονες καὶ σπέρματα ἐξ αὐτοῦ
ἀναστήσονται, καὶ βεβηλώσουσι τὸ ἁγίασμα τῆς δυναστείας, καὶ
μεταστήσουσι τὸν ἐνδελεχισμόν, καὶ δώσουσι βδέλυγμα ἠφανισμέ-
32 νον, καὶ οἱ ἀνομοῦντες διαθήκην ἐπάξουσιν ἐν ὀλισθήμασι· καὶ λαὸς
33 γινώσκοντες Θεὸν αὐτοῦ κατισχύσουσι, καὶ ποιήσουσι, καὶ οἱ
συνετοὶ λαοῦ μου συνήσουσιν εἰς πολλά, καὶ ἀσθενήσουσιν ἐν
ῥομφαίᾳ, καὶ ἐν φλογί, καὶ ἐν αἰχμαλωσίᾳ, καὶ ἐν διαρπαγῇ ἡ-
34 μερῶν. Καὶ ἐν τῷ ἀσθενῆσαι αὐτούς, βοηθήσονται βοήθειαν μι-
35 κράν, καὶ προστεθήσονται πρὸς αὐτοὺς πολλοὶ ἐν ὀλισθήμασι. Καὶ
ἀπὸ τῶν συνιέντων ἀσθενήσουσι, τοῦ πυρῶσαι αὐτούς, καὶ τοῦ
ἐκλέξασθαι, καὶ τοῦ ἀποκαλυφθῆναι ἕως καιροῦ πέρας, ὅτι ἔτι εἰς
36 καιρόν, καὶ ποιήσει κατὰ τὸ θέλημα αὐτοῦ· καὶ ὑψωθήσεται καὶ
μεγαλυνθήσεται ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐπὶ πάντα θεόν, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν Θεὸν τῶν
θεῶν, καὶ λαλήσει ὑπέρογκα, καὶ κατευθυνεῖ μέχρις οὗ συντελε-
37 σθῇ ἡ ὀργή, εἰς γὰρ συντέλειαν γίνεται· καὶ ἐπὶ πάντας θεοὺς τῶν
πατέρων αὐτοῦ οὐ συνήσει, καὶ ἐπ᾽ ἐπιθυμίαν γυναικῶν, καὶ ἐπὶ
38 πάντα θεὸν οὐ συνήσει, ὅτι ἐπὶ πάντας μεγαλυνθήσεται. Καὶ θεὸν
Μαωζεὶμ ἐπὶ τόπου αὐτοῦ (οὐ) δοξάσει, καὶ θεὸν ὃν οὐκ ἔγνωσαν
οἱ πατέρες αὐτοῦ δοξάσει ἐν χρυσίῳ καὶ ἀργύρῳ καὶ λίθῳ τιμίῳ,
39 καὶ ἐν ἐπιθυμήμασι, καὶ ποιήσει τοῖς ὀχυρώμασι τῶν καταφυγῶν
μετὰ θεοῦ ἀλλοτρίου, καὶ πληθυνεῖ δόξαν, καὶ ὑποτάξει αὐτοῖς
40 πολλούς, καὶ γῆν διελεῖ ἐν δώροις, καὶ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ πέρατι συγ-
κερατισθήσεται μετὰ τοῦ βασιλέως τοῦ νότου, καὶ συναχθήσεται

**Chapter 11.**

**24** ...of the South shall join war, even with great and exceeding mighty power; yet shall they not stand, for they shall devise stratagems against him.
**26** And they that eat his provisions shall crush him; and [his] forces shall be overwhelmed, and many wounded shall fall.
**27** And both kings, their hearts shall be set on mischief, and at one table shall they speak falsehoods; yet shall it not prosper, for there is still an end [appointed] for a season.
**28** And he shall return to his land with much substance, and his heart shall be set against the holy covenant; and he shall act, and he shall return to his land.
**29** At the appointed time he shall return, and shall come into the South; yet shall it not be as the first and as the last.
**30** And there shall enter (those) in him (and) the Kittim going forth; and he shall be humbled, and shall return, and shall be enraged against the holy covenant. And he shall act, and he shall return, and shall show favor to those who forsake the holy covenant.
**31** And arms and offspring from him shall arise, and they shall profane the sanctuary of the mighty power, and shall remove the continual [sacrifice], and they shall set up the abomination of desolation.
**32** And those that transgress the covenant shall he bring [to apostasy] with flatteries. But the people that know their God shall be strong, and shall act.
**33** And the wise among my people shall instruct many; yet shall they stumble by sword, and by flame, and by captivity, and by the plundering of [many] days.
**34** And when they are weakened, they shall be helped with a little help.
**35** And many shall join themselves unto them with flatteries. And some of the wise shall stumble, to refine them by fire, and to choose [them], and to make [them] manifest, until the time of the end; for it is yet for an appointed time.
**36** And the king shall act according to his will; and he shall be exalted and magnified above every god, and above the God of gods, and shall speak presumptuous things, and shall prosper until the wrath be accomplished; for it is [ordained] for a consummation.
**37** And he shall not regard all the gods of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor any god shall he regard; for he shall magnify himself above all.
**38** And a god of strongholds, in his place, he shall (not) honor; and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honor with gold, and with silver, and with precious stone,
**39** and with desirable things. And he shall deal with the strongholds of refuges with a strange god; and he shall increase glory, and shall subject many to them, and shall divide the land by rewards.
**40** And at the time of the end shall he clash with the king of the South, and he shall be gathered.
