16. Ὅτι ὡς δάμαλις παροιστρῶσα παροίστρησεν Ἰσραήλ· νῦν νεμήσει αὐτοὺς Κύριος, ὡς ἀμνὸν ἐν εὐρυχώρῳ.
17. Μέτοχος εἰδώλων Ἐφραὶμ ἔθηκεν ἑαυτῷ σκάνδαλα, ἠρέτισε Χαναναίους·
18. πορνεύοντες ἐξεπόρνευσαν, ἠγάπησαν ἀτιμίαν ἐκ φρυάγματος αὐτῆς.
19. Συστροφὴ πνεύματος σὺ εἶ ἐν ταῖς πτερύξιν αὐτῆς, καὶ καταισχυνθήσονται ἐκ τῶν θυσιαστηρίων αὐτῶν.

1.  ἈΚΟΥΣΑΤΕ ταῦτα οἱ ἱερεῖς, καὶ προσέχετε οἶκος Ἰσραήλ, καὶ οἶκος τοῦ βασιλέως ἐνωτίζεσθε, διότι πρὸς ὑμᾶς ἐστι τὸ κρίμα· ὅτι παγὶς ἐγενήθητε τῇ σκοπιᾷ, καὶ ὡς δίκτυον ἐκτεταμένον ἐπὶ τὸ Ἰταβύριον, ἃ οἱ ἀγρεύοντες τὴν θήραν κατέπηξαν.
2.  Ἐγὼ δὲ παιδευτὴς ὑμῶν·
3.  ἐγὼ ἔγνων τὸν Ἐφραίμ, καὶ Ἰσραὴλ οὐκ ἀπέστη ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ· διότι νῦν ἐξεπόρνευσεν Ἐφραίμ, ἐμιάνθη Ἰσραήλ.
4.  Οὐκ ἔδωκαν τὰ διαβούλια αὐτῶν τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι πρὸς τὸν Θεὸν αὐτῶν, ὅτι πνεῦμα πορνείας ἐν αὐτοῖς ἐστι, τὸν δὲ Κύριον οὐκ ἐπέγνωσαν.
5.  Καὶ ταπεινωθήσεται ἡ ὕβρις τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ εἰς πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ, καὶ Ἰσραὴλ καὶ Ἐφραὶμ ἀσθενήσουσιν ἐν ταῖς ἀδικίαις αὐτῶν· καὶ ἀσθενήσει καίγε Ἰούδας μετ᾿ αὐτῶν.
6.  Μετὰ προβάτων καὶ μόσχων πορεύσονται τοῦ ἐκζητῆσαι τὸν Κύριον, καὶ οὐ μὴ εὕρωσιν αὐτὸν, ὅτι ἐξέκλινεν ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν·
7.  ὅτι τὸν Κύριον ἐγκατέλιπον, καὶ ὅτι τέκνα ἀλλότρια ἐγεννήθησαν αὐτοῖς· νῦν καταφάγεται αὐτοὺς ἡ ἐρυσίβη, καὶ τοὺς κλήρους αὐτῶν.
8.  Σαλπίσατε σάλπιγγι ἐπὶ τοὺς βουνοὺς, ἠχήσατε ἐπὶ τῶν ὑψηλῶν, κηρύξατε ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ Ὤν, ἐξέστη Βενιαμείν,
9.  Ἐφραὶμ εἰς ἀφανισμὸν ἐγένετο ἐν ἡμέραις ἐλέγχου. Ἐν ταῖς φυλαῖς τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ ἔδειξα πιστὰ,
10. ἐγένοντο οἱ ἄρχοντες Ἰούδα ὡς μετατιθέντες ὅρια· ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς ἐκχεῶ τὸ ὕδωρ ὡς ὄρμα μου.
11. Κατεδυνάστευσεν Ἐφραὶμ τὸν ἀντίδικον αὐτοῦ, κατεπάτησε κρίμα, ὅτι ἤρξατο πορεύεσθαι ὀπίσω τῶν ματαίων.
12. Καὶ ἐγὼ ὡς ἀράχνη τῷ Ἐφραίμ, καὶ ὡς κέντρον τῷ οἴκῳ Ἰούδα.
13. Καὶ εἶδεν Ἐφραὶμ τὴν νόσον αὐτοῦ, καὶ Ἰούδας τὴν ὀδύνην αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐπορεύθη Ἐφραὶμ πρὸς Ἀσσυρίους, καὶ ἀπέστειλε πρέσβεις πρὸς βασιλέα Ἰαρείμ· καὶ αὐτὸς οὐχ ἠδυνάσθη ἰάσασθαι ὑμᾶς, καὶ οὐ μὴ διαπαύσῃ ἐξ ὑμῶν ὀδύνην.
14. Διότι ἐγὼ εἰμι ὡς πανθὴρ τῷ Ἐφραίμ, καὶ ὡς λέων τῷ οἴκῳ Ἰούδα.

**HOSEA**
**CHAPTER 4**

**16** For as a wayward heifer hath Israel gone astray;
    Now the Lord shall pasture them as a lamb in a broad place.
**17** Ephraim is joined unto idols;
    He hath set stumblingblocks for himself,
    He hath provoked the Canaanites.
**18** Whoremongers, they have utterly committed whoredom;
    They have loved dishonor from her haughty pride.
**19** Thou art a whirlwind spirit within her wings;
    And they shall be ashamed of their altars.

**CHAPTER 5**

**1** Hear ye these things, O ye priests;
    And give ear, O house of Israel;
    And, O house of the king, incline your ear;
    For unto you belongeth the judgment.
    For ye became a snare [at the] watchtower,
    And as a net spread out upon Mount Tabor,
    Which the hunters of the prey have fixed.
**2** But I am your Chastiser.
**3** I have known Ephraim,
    And Israel hath not departed from Me;
    For now Ephraim hath committed whoredom,
    And Israel is defiled.
**4** Their counsels suffered them not to return unto their God;
    For a spirit of whoredom is within them,
    And they have not known the Lord.
**5** And the pride of Israel shall be humbled before his face;
    And Israel and Ephraim shall faint in their iniquities;
    And Judah also shall faint with them.
**6** With flocks and with calves shall they go to seek the Lord,
    But they shall not find Him;
    For He hath withdrawn Himself from them.
**7** For they have forsaken the Lord,
    And because strange children were born unto them;
    Now shall the blight consume them,
    And their portions.
**8** Blow ye the trumpet upon the mountains;
    Sound forth upon the high places;
    Proclaim in the House of On:
    Benjamin is confounded.
**9** Ephraim is made desolate in the days of rebuke;
    Among the tribes of Israel have I shown sure things.
**10** The princes of Judah became as those that remove landmarks;
    Upon them will I pour out My water as My mighty surge.
**11** Ephraim oppressed his adversary,
    And trampled judgment,
    Because he began to walk after vain things.
**12** And I am as a spider unto Ephraim,
    And as a sting unto the house of Judah.
**13** And Ephraim saw his sickness,
    And Judah his pain;
    Then went Ephraim to the Assyrians,
    And sent ambassadors unto King Jarib;
    Yet was he not able to heal you,
    Nor shall he give you rest from your pain.
**14** For I am as a panther unto Ephraim,
    And as a lion unto the house of Judah.
