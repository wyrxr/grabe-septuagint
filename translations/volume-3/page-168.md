1106 ΕΚΚΛΗΣΙΑΣΤΗΣ. ΚΕΦ. Γ΄.
2 τὸν οὐρανόν. Καιρὸς τοῦ τεκεῖν, καὶ καιρὸς τοῦ ἀποθανεῖν· καιρὸς
3 τοῦ φυτεῦσαι, καὶ καιρὸς τοῦ ἐκτῖλαι τὸ πεφυτευμένον· καιρὸς
4 τοῦ ἀποκτεῖναι, καὶ καιρὸς τοῦ ἰάσασθαι· καιρὸς τοῦ καθελεῖν, καὶ
5 λάσαι· καιρὸς τοῦ κόψασθαι, καὶ καιρὸς τοῦ ὀρχήσασθαι· καιρὸς
6 τοῦ βαλεῖν λίθους, καὶ καιρὸς τοῦ συναγαγεῖν λίθους· καιρὸς τοῦ
7 περιλαβεῖν, καὶ καιρὸς τοῦ μακρυνθῆναι ἀπὸ περιλήμματος· καιρὸς
8 τοῦ ζητῆσαι, καὶ καιρὸς τοῦ ἀπολέσαι· καιρὸς τοῦ φυλάξαι, καὶ
9 καιρὸς τοῦ ἐκβαλεῖν· καιρὸς τοῦ ῥῆξαι, καὶ καιρὸς τοῦ ῥάψαι·
10 καιρὸς τοῦ σιγᾶν, καὶ καιρὸς τοῦ λαλεῖν· καιρὸς τοῦ φιλῆσαι, καὶ
11 καιρὸς τοῦ μισῆσαι· καιρὸς πολέμου, καὶ καιρὸς εἰρήνης. Τίς πε-
12 ρίσσεια τοῦ ποιοῦντος ἐν οἷς αὐτὸς μοχθεῖ; Ἴδον σὺν τὸν περι-
13 σπασμὸν ὃν ἔδωκεν ὁ Θεὸς τοῖς υἱοῖς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου, τοῦ περισπᾶ-
14 σθαι ἐν αὐτῷ. Σὺν πάντα (ἃ) ἐποίησε καλὰ ἐν καιρῷ αὐτοῦ. Καί
15 γε σὺν τὸν αἰῶνα ἔδωκεν ἐν καρδίᾳ αὐτῶν, ὅπως μὴ εὕρῃ ὁ ἄν-
16 θρωπος τὸ ποίημα ὃ ἐποίησεν ὁ Θεὸς ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς καὶ μέχρι τέλους.
17 Ἔγνων ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν ἀγαθὸν ἐν αὐτοῖς, εἰ μὴ τοῦ εὐφρανθῆναι
18 καὶ τοῦ ποιεῖν ἀγαθὸν ἐν ζωῇ αὐτοῦ· καὶ γε πᾶς ὁ ἄνθρωπος ὃς
19 φάγεται καὶ πίεται, καὶ ἴδῃ ἀγαθὸν ἐν παντὶ μόχθῳ αὐτοῦ, (τοῦτο)
20 δόμα Θεοῦ ἐστιν. Ἔγνων ὅτι πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν ὁ Θεός, αὐτὰ
21 ἔσται εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα· ἐπ’ αὐτῷ οὐκ ἔστι προσθεῖναι, καὶ ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ
22 οὐκ ἔστιν ἀφελεῖν· καὶ ὁ Θεὸς ἐποίησεν, ἵνα φοβηθῶσιν ἀπὸ προ-
23 σώπου αὐτοῦ. Τὸ γενόμενον ἤδη, ἐστὶ, καὶ ὅσα τοῦ γίνεσθαι, ἤδη
24 γέγονε· καὶ ὁ Θεὸς ζητήσει τὸν διωκόμενον. Καὶ ἔτι ἴδον ὑπὸ τὸν
25 ἥλιον τόπον τῆς κρίσεως, ἐκεῖ ὁ ἀσεβής· καὶ τόπον τοῦ δικαίου,
26 ἐκεῖ ὁ ἀσεβής. (Ἐκεῖ) εἶπον ἐγὼ ἐν καρδίᾳ μου· σὺν τὸν δίκαιον
27 καὶ σὺν τὸν ἀσεβῆ κρινεῖ ὁ Θεός, ὅτι καιρὸς τῷ παντὶ πράγματι
28 καὶ ἐπὶ παντὶ τῷ ποιήματι. Ἐκεῖ εἶπα ἐγὼ ἐν καρδίᾳ μου περὶ
29 λαλιᾶς υἱῶν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου, ὅτι διακρινεῖ αὐτοὺς ὁ Θεός· καὶ τοῦ
30 δεῖξαι ὅτι αὐτοὶ κτήνη εἰσί, καὶ γε αὐτοῖς συνάντημα υἱῶν τοῦ
31 ἀνθρώπου, καὶ συνάντημα τοῦ κτήνους συνάντημα ἐν αὐτοῖς· ὡς
32 ὁ θάνατος τούτου, οὕτως ὁ θάνατος τούτου, καὶ πνεῦμα ἐν τοῖς
33 πᾶσι. Καὶ τί ἐπερίσσευσεν ὁ ἄνθρωπος παρὰ τὸ κτῆνος; οὐδέν·
34 ὅτι τὰ πάντα ματαιότης. Τὰ πάντα πορεύεται εἰς τόπον ἕνα· τὰ
35 πάντα ἐγένετο ἀπὸ τοῦ χοός, καὶ τὰ πάντα ἐπιστρέφει εἰς τὸν
36 χοῦν· καὶ τίς οἶδεν τὸ πνεῦμα υἱῶν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου, εἰ ἀναβαίνει

**CHAPTER 3**

**2** A time to be born, and a time to die;
    a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;
**3** A time to kill, and a time to heal;
    a time to pull down, and a time to seize;
**4** A time to lament, and a time to dance;
**5** A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones;
    a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
**6** A time to seek, and a time to lose;
    a time to keep, and a time to cast away;
**7** A time to rend, and a time to sew;
    a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;
**8** A time to love, and a time to hate;
    a time of war, and a time of peace.
**9** What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?
**10** I have seen also the travail which God hath given to the sons of men,
    to be exercised therewith.
**11** All things [which] He hath made fair in His time:
    and verily, He hath set eternity in their heart,
    so that man should not find out the work
    that God hath wrought from the beginning even to the end.
**12** I knew that there is no good in them,
    save for a man to rejoice and to do good in his life.
**13** And also every man that eateth and drinketh,
    and seeth good in all his labour, (this) is the gift of God.
**14** I knew that whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever;
    nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken from it;
    and God hath done it, that men should fear before His face.
**15** That which hath been is now;
    and that which is to be hath already been;
    and God shall seek out the persecuted.
**16** And moreover I saw under the sun
    the place of judgment, that there the wicked was;
    and the place of righteousness, that there the wicked was.
**17** (Then) said I in my heart, "God shall judge
    both the righteous and the wicked;
    for there is a time for every purpose and for every work."
**18** There I said in my heart concerning the state of the sons of men,
    that God might test them;
    and to show them that they themselves are [but] beasts.
    And verily, for them is the same event as for the sons of men,
    and the event of the beast is one event among them.
**19** As the death of the one, so is the death of the other;
    and there is but one spirit in all.
**20** And what profit hath man more than the beast? Nothing;
    for all is vanity.
**21** All go unto one place;
    all are made from the dust, and all return unto the dust.
    And who knoweth the spirit of the sons of men,
    whether it ascendeth upward?
    And the spirit of the beast, whether it descendeth downward to the earth?
