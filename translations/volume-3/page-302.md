20 πρὸς αὐτούς. Καὶ δώσω σε τῷ λαῷ τούτῳ, ὡς τεῖχος ὀχυρόν,
    χαλκοῦν· καὶ πολεμήσουσι πρὸς σὲ, καὶ οὐ μὴ δύνανται πρὸς
21 σὲ, διότι μετὰ σοῦ εἰμι τοῦ σώζειν σε, καὶ τοῦ ἐξαιρεῖσθαί σε,
    φησὶ Κύριος· καὶ ῥύσομαί σε ἐκ χειρὸς πονηρῶν, καὶ λυτρώσο-
    μαί σε ἐκ χειρὸς λοιμῶν.

ΚΕΦ. ΙϚ΄. XVI.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς με, λέγων· καὶ οὐ μὴ λά-
2 βῃς γυναῖκα, λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ οὐ γεννη-
3 θήσεταί σοι υἱὸς, οὐδὲ θυγάτηρ ἐν τῷ τόπῳ τούτῳ. Ὅτι τάδε
    λέγει Κύριος περὶ τῶν υἱῶν καὶ περὶ τῶν θυγατέρων τῶν γεν-
    νωμένων ἐν τῷ τόπῳ τούτῳ, καὶ περὶ τῶν μητέρων αὐτῶν τῶν
    τετοκυιῶν αὐτοὺς, καὶ περὶ τῶν πατέρων αὐτῶν τῶν γεγεν-
4 νηκότων αὐτοὺς ἐν τῇ γῇ ταύτῃ. Ἐν θανάτῳ νοσερῷ ἀποθανοῦν-
    ται, οὐ κοπήσονται, οὐδὲ ταφήσονται· εἰς παράδειγμα ἐπὶ προ-
    σώπου τῆς γῆς ἔσονται, καὶ ἔσται τὰ θνησιμαῖα εἰς βρῶσιν τοῖς
    θηρίοις τῆς γῆς καὶ τοῖς πετεινοῖς τοῦ οὐρανοῦ· ἐν μαχαίρᾳ πε-
5 σοῦνται, καὶ ἐν λιμῷ συντελεσθήσονται. Τάδε λέγει Κύριος· μὴ
    εἰσέλθῃς εἰς θίασον αὐτῶν, καὶ μὴ πορευθῇς τοῦ κόψασθαι, καὶ
    μὴ πενθήσῃς αὐτοὺς, ὅτι ἀφέστηκα τὴν εἰρήνην μου ἀπὸ τοῦ
    λαοῦ τούτου, φησὶ Κύριος, καὶ τὸν ἔλεόν μου καὶ τοὺς οἰκτιρμούς
6 μου. Καὶ ἀποθανοῦνται μεγάλοι καὶ μικροὶ ἐν τῇ γῇ ταύτῃ· οὐ
    μὴ ταφῶσιν, οὐδὲ μὴ κόψωνται αὐτοὺς, οὐδὲ ἐντομίδας οὐ μὴ
7 ποιήσουσιν, οὐδὲ ξυρήσονται, καὶ οὐ μὴ κλασθῇ ἄρτος ἐν πένθει
    αὐτῶν εἰς παράκλησιν ἐπὶ τεθνηκότι· οὐ ποτιοῦσιν αὐτὸν πο-
    τήριον εἰς παράκλησιν ἐπὶ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπὶ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ.
8 Εἰς οἰκίαν πότου οὐκ εἰσελεύσῃ σὺ, τοῦ καθίσαι μετ᾿ αὐτῶν τοῦ
9 φαγεῖν καὶ πιεῖν. Διότι τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ· ἰδοὺ
    ἐγὼ καταλύω ἐκ τοῦ τόπου τούτου ἐνώπιον τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν ὑ-
    μῶν, καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ὑμῶν, φωνὴν χαρᾶς, καὶ φωνὴν εὐ-
10 φροσύνης, φωνὴν νυμφίου, καὶ φωνὴν νύμφης. Καὶ ἔσται, ὅταν
    ἀπαγγείλῃς τῷ λαῷ τούτῳ πάντα τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα, καὶ εἴπωσι
    πρός σε, διατί ἐλάλησε Κύριος ἐφ᾿ ἡμᾶς πάντα τὰ κακὰ ταῦτα
    τὰ μεγάλα; τίς ἡ ἀδικία ἡμῶν; καὶ τίς ἡ ἁμαρτία ἡμῶν,
11 ἣν ἡμάρτομεν ἐναντίον Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν; Καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς

### JEREMIAH 15

**20** unto them. And I will make thee unto this people as a strong wall of brass; and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee, for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the Lord.
**21** And I will rescue thee from the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee from the hand of the pestilent ones.

### JEREMIAH 16

**1** And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying:
**2** Thou shalt not take thee a wife, saith the Lord God of Israel, neither shall there be born unto thee a son or a daughter in this place.
**3** For thus saith the Lord concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that bare them, and concerning their fathers that begat them in this land:
**4** By grievous deaths shall they die; they shall not be lamented, nor shall they be buried. They shall be for a manifest warning upon the face of the earth, and their corpses shall be for meat unto the beasts of the earth and to the fowls of the heaven. They shall fall by the sword, and by famine shall they be consumed.
**5** Thus saith the Lord: Enter not into their festive assembly, neither go thou forth to lament, nor mourn for them; for I have withdrawn My peace from this people, saith the Lord, even My mercy and My compassions.
**6** And the great and the small shall die in this land; they shall not be buried, neither shall men lament for them, nor make incisions, nor shave themselves.
**7** Neither shall bread be broken for them in their mourning for consolation over the dead; they shall not give him a cup to drink for consolation for his father and for his mother.
**8** Thou shalt not enter into the house of feasting, to sit with them to eat and to drink.
**9** For thus saith the Lord God of Israel: Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place, before your eyes and in your days, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride.
**10** And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt declare unto this people all these words, and they shall say unto thee, "Wherefore hath the Lord pronounced against us all these great evils? What is our iniquity? And what is our sin which we have committed against the Lord our God?"
**11** Then shalt thou say unto
