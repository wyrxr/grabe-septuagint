1 Ὁ ΛΟΓΟΣ Ο ΓΕΝΟΜΕΝΟΣ ΠΑΡὰ ΚΥΡΙΟΥ ΠΡΟΣ
2 ΙΕΡΕΜΙΑΝ, ΛΕΓΩΝ· Ἀκούσατε τοὺς λόγους τῆς διαθήκης
    ταύτης, καὶ λαλήσεις πρὸς ἄνδρας Ἰούδα, καὶ πρὸς τοὺς κατοι-
3 κοῦντας Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτούς· τάδε λέγει Κύριος
    ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ· ἐπικατάρατος ὁ ἄνθρωπος, ὃς οὐκ ἀκούσεται τῶν
4 λόγων τῆς διαθήκης ταύτης, ἣν ἐνετειλάμην τοῖς πατράσιν ὑμῶν,
    ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ᾗ ἀνήγαγον αὐτοὺς ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, ἐκ καμίνου τῆς σι-
    δηρᾶς, λέγων, ἀκούσατε τῆς φωνῆς μου, καὶ ποιήσατε πάντα ὅσα
    ἐντείλωμαι ὑμῖν, καὶ ἔσεσθέ μοι εἰς λαόν, καὶ ἐγὼ ἔσομαι ὑμῖν
5 εἰς Θεόν, ὅπως στήσω τὸν ὅρκον μου, ὃν ὤμοσα τοῖς πατράσιν
    ὑμῶν, τοῦ δοῦναι αὐτοῖς γῆν ῥέουσαν γάλα καὶ μέλι, ὡς ἡ ἡμέρα
6 αὕτη· καὶ ἀπεκρίθην καὶ εἶπα, γένοιτο Κύριε. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος
    πρὸς με· ἀνάγνωθι τοὺς λόγους τούτους ἐν πόλεσιν Ἰούδα, καὶ
    ἔξωθεν Ἱερουσαλήμ, λέγων· ἀκούσατε τοὺς λόγους τῆς διαθήκης
7 ταύτης, καὶ ποιήσατε αὐτούς. Ὅτι διαμαρτυρόμενος διεμαρτυ-
    ράμην τοῖς πατράσιν ὑμῶν, ἐν ᾗ ἡμέρᾳ ἀνήγαγον αὐτοὺς ἐκ γῆς
    Αἰγύπτου, καὶ ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης, ὀρθρίζων καὶ ἐπιμαρτυρό-
8 μενος, καὶ λέγων· ἀκούσατε τῆς φωνῆς μου. Καὶ οὐκ ἤκουσαν,
    καὶ ἐξέκλιναν τὸ οὖς αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν ἀνὴρ ἐν τῇ εὐθύτητι
    τῆς καρδίας αὐτοῦ τῆς πονηρᾶς· καὶ ἐπήγαγον ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς πάντας
    τοὺς λόγους τῆς διαθήκης ταύτης, ἧς ἐνετειλάμην ποιῆσαι αὐτούς,
9 καὶ οὐκ ἐποίησαν. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς με· εὑρέθη σύνδεσμος
10 ἐν ἀνδράσιν Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐν τοῖς κατοικοῦσιν Ἱερουσαλήμ. Ἐπεστρά-
    φησαν ἐπὶ τὰς ἀδικίας τῶν πατέρων αὐτῶν τῶν πρότερον, οἳ οὐκ
    ἤθελον ἀκοῦσαι τῶν λόγων μου, καὶ ἰδοὺ αὐτοὶ πορεύονται ὀπίσω
    θεῶν ἀλλοτρίων, τοῦ δουλεύειν αὐτοῖς, καὶ διεσκέδασεν οἶκος
    Ἰσραὴλ καὶ οἶκος Ἰούδα τὴν διαθήκην μου, ἣν διεθέμην πρὸς τοὺς
11 πατέρας αὐτῶν. Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Κύριος· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐπάγω
    ἐπὶ τὸν λαὸν τοῦτον κακά, ἐξ ὧν οὐ δυνήσονται ἐξελθεῖν ἐξ αὐτῶν·
12 καὶ κεκράξονται πρὸς με, καὶ οὐκ εἰσακούσομαι αὐτῶν, καὶ πο-
    ρεύσονται πόλεις Ἰούδα καὶ οἱ κατοικοῦντες Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ κε-
    κράξονται πρὸς τοὺς θεοὺς αὐτῶν, οἷς αὐτοὶ θυμιῶσιν αὐτοῖς, καὶ
13 σωτηρία οὐ μὴ σώσουσιν αὐτοὺς ἐν καιρῷ τῶν κακῶν αὐτῶν. Ὅτι

CHAPTER XI.

**1** The word which came from the Lord unto Jeremiah, saying:
**2** "Hearken to the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah, and to those who dwell in Jerusalem.
**3** And you shall say to them, 'Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Cursed is the man who does not hearken to the words of this covenant,
**4** which I commanded your fathers in the day when I brought them forth from the land of Egypt, out of the iron furnace, saying: Hearken to My voice, and do all whatsoever I command you; and you shall be My people, and I will be your God,
**5** that I may establish My oath, which I swore to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day.'"
**6** And I answered and said, "So be it, Lord." And the Lord said unto me, "Read these words in the cities of Judah, and outside Jerusalem, saying: Hearken to the words of this covenant, and do them.
**7** For testifying, I earnestly testified to your fathers in the day when I brought them forth from the land of Egypt, and even unto this day, rising early and testifying, and saying: Hearken to My voice.
**8** But they did not hearken, neither did they incline their ear, but walked each man in the stubbornness of his evil heart. And I brought upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, and they did them not."
**9** And the Lord said unto me, "A conspiracy has been found among the men of Judah, and among those who dwell in Jerusalem.
**10** They have turned back to the iniquities of their fathers of old, who would not hearken to My words; and behold, they themselves walk after alien gods, to serve them; and the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken My covenant, which I made with their fathers.
**11** Therefore thus says the Lord: Behold, I am bringing upon this people evils, from which they will not be able to escape.
**12** And they shall cry unto Me, but I will not hearken to them. And the cities of Judah and those who dwell in Jerusalem shall go and cry unto their gods, to whom they themselves burn incense; but salvation shall by no means save them in the time of their evils.
**13** For according to the number of your cities were your gods, O Judah, and according to the number of the exits of Jerusalem, you set up altars to shame, altars to burn incense to Baal.
