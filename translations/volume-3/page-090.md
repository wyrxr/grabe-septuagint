**ΨΑΛΜ. ΡΙΕ΄. CXV.**
8 διέρρηξας τοὺς δεσμούς μου. Σοὶ θύσω θυσίαν αἰνέσεως,
9 καὶ ἐν ὀνόματι Κυρίου ἐπικαλέσομαι τὰς εὐχάς μου τῷ Κυρίῳ
10 ἀποδώσω ἐναντίον παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ, ἐν αὐλαῖς οἴκου Κυρίου, ἐν μέσῳ σου Ἱερουσαλήμ. Ἀλληλούϊα.

**ΨΑΛΤΗΡ. ΨΑΛΜ. ΡΙΖ΄. CXVI.**
1 ἈΛΛΗΛΟΥΪΑ. Αἰνεῖτε τὸν Κύριον πάντα τὰ ἔθνη. (κστ΄)
2 ἐπαινεσάτωσαν αὐτὸν πάντες οἱ λαοί· ὅτι ἐκραταιώθη ἐφ᾽ ἡμᾶς
τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἡ ἀλήθεια τοῦ Κυρίου μένει εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ΡΙΖ΄. CXVII.**
1 ἈΛΛΗΛΟΥΪΑ. Ἐξομολογεῖσθε τῷ Κυρίῳ, ὅτι ἀγαθός, ὅτι
2 εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ. Εἰπάτω δὴ οἶκος Ἰσραήλ· ὅτι
3 ἀγαθός, ὅτι εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ. Εἰπάτω δὴ οἶκος Ἀαρών (ὅτι ἀγαθός), ὅτι εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ. Εἰπάτωσαν δὴ (πάντες) οἱ φοβούμενοι τὸν Κύριον· ὅτι εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τὸ
6 ἔλεος αὐτοῦ. Ἐκ θλίψεως ἐπεκαλεσάμην τὸν Κύριον, καὶ ἐπήκουσέ μου εἰς πλατυσμόν Κύριος. Κύριος ἐμοὶ βοηθός, (καὶ) οὐ φοβηθήσομαι τί ποιήσει μοι ἄνθρωπος· Κύριος ἐμοὶ βοηθός, καὶ ἐγὼ
9 ἐπόψομαι τοὺς ἐχθρούς μου. Ἀγαθὸν πεποιθέναι ἐπὶ Κύριον, ἢ
10 πεποιθέναι ἐπ᾽ ἀνθρώπων· ἀγαθὸν ἐλπίζειν ἐπὶ Κύριον, ἢ ἐλπίζειν
11 ἐπ᾽ ἄρχοντας. Πάντα τὰ ἔθνη ἐκύκλωσάν με, καὶ ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι
12 Κυρίου ὅτι ἠμυνάμην αὐτούς· κυκλώσαντες ἐκύκλωσάν με, καὶ ἐν
13 τῷ ὀνόματι Κυρίου ὅτι ἠμυνάμην αὐτούς· ἐκύκλωσάν με ὡσεὶ μέ-
14 λισσαι (κηρίον), καὶ ἐξεκαύθησαν ὡσεὶ πῦρ ἐν ἀκάνθαις· καὶ ἐν τῷ
15 ὀνόματι Κυρίου ὅτι ἠμυνάμην αὐτούς. Ὠσθεὶς ἀνετράπην τοῦ πε-
16 σεῖν, καὶ ὁ Κύριος ἀντελάβετό μου· ἰσχύς μου καὶ ὕμνησίς μου ὁ
17 Κύριος, καὶ ἐγένετό μοι εἰς σωτηρίαν. Φωνὴ ἀγαλλιάσεως καὶ σω-
18 τηρίας ἐν σκηναῖς δικαίων· δεξιὰ Κυρίου ἐποίησε δύναμιν, δεξιὰ
19 Κυρίου ὕψωσέ με, δεξιὰ Κυρίου ἐποίησε δύναμιν. Οὐκ ἀποθανοῦ-
20 μαι, ἀλλὰ ζήσομαι, καὶ ἐκδιηγήσομαι τὰ ἔργα Κυρίου· παιδεύων
21 ἐπαίδευσέ με ὁ Κύριος, καὶ τῷ θανάτῳ οὐ παρέδωκέ με. Ἀνοίξα-
22 τέ μοι πύλας δικαιοσύνης· εἰσελθὼν ἐν αὐταῖς ἐξομολογήσομαι τῷ
23 Κυρίῳ. Αὕτη ἡ πύλη τοῦ Κυρίου· δίκαιοι εἰσελεύσονται ἐν αὐτῇ.

**PSALM CXV.**
**(continued)**
8. Thou hast loosed my bonds.
    Unto Thee will I offer the sacrifice of praise,
9. and upon the Name of the Lord will I call.
    My vows unto the Lord
10. will I pay before all His people,
    in the courts of the house of the Lord,
    in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Alleluia.

**PSALM CXVI.**
**ALLELUIA.**
1. Praise the Lord, all ye nations; (117:1 MT)
2. let all peoples praise Him.
    For His mercy is made strong upon us,
    and the truth of the Lord abideth unto the age.

**PSALM CXVII.**
**ALLELUIA.**
1. Give thanks unto the Lord, for He is good;
2. for His mercy endureth unto the age.
    Let the house of Israel now say,
    "For He is good; for His mercy endureth unto the age."
3. Let the house of Aaron now say,
    "[For He is good;] for His mercy endureth unto the age."
4. Let all them that fear the Lord now say,
    "For His mercy endureth unto the age."
5. Out of tribulation I called upon the Lord,
    and the Lord heard me [and set me] in a broad place.
6. The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear
    what man shall do unto me.
7. The Lord is my helper, and I shall look down upon my enemies.
8. It is good to trust in the Lord,
    rather than to trust in men.
9. It is good to hope in the Lord,
    rather than to hope in princes.
10. All the nations compassed me round about,
    and in the Name of the Lord did I put them to flight.
11. They compassed me round, yea, they compassed me round about,
    and in the Name of the Lord did I put them to flight.
12. They compassed me about like bees [around a honeycomb],
    and they were burnt up like fire among thorns;
    and in the Name of the Lord did I put them to flight.
13. I was thrust and overthrown, [so as] to fall;
    but the Lord upheld me.
14. The Lord is my strength and my song of praise,
    and He is become my salvation.
15. The voice of rejoicing and salvation
    is in the tents of the righteous.
    The right hand of the Lord hath wrought strength,
    the right hand of the Lord hath exalted me,
    the right hand of the Lord hath wrought strength.
16. I shall not die, but live,
    and shall declare the works of the Lord.
17. The Lord hath chastened me sorely,
    but hath not given me over unto death.
18. Open unto me the gates of righteousness,
    that I may enter into them and give thanks unto the Lord.
19. This is the gate of the Lord;
    the righteous shall enter into it.
