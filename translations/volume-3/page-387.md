δίψει, νήπια ᾔτησαν ἄρτον, καὶ ὁ διακλῶν οὐκ ἔστιν αὐτοῖς.

**Ἤ.**
5   Οἱ ἐσθίοντες τὰς τρυφὰς ἠφανίσθησαν ἐν ταῖς ἐξόδοις, οἱ τιθηνούμενοι ἐπὶ κόκκων περιεβάλλοντο κοπρίας.

**Οὐαῦ.**
6   Καὶ ἐμεγαλύνθη ἡ ἀνομία θυγατρὸς λαοῦ μου ὑπὲρ ἀνομίας Σοδόμων τῆς κατεστραμμένης ὥσπερ σπουδή, καὶ οὐκ ἐπόνεσαν ἐν αὐτῇ χεῖρας.

**Ζαΐν.**
7   Ἐκαθαριώθησαν Ναζιραῖοι αὐτῆς ὑπὲρ χιόνα, ἔλαμψαν ὑπὲρ γάλα, ἐπυρρώθησαν ὑπὲρ λίθους, σάπφειρος τὸ ἀπόσπασμα αὐτῶν.

**Ἥθ.**
8   Ἐσκότασεν ὑπὲρ ἀσβόλην τὸ εἶδος αὐτῶν, οὐκ ἐπεγνώσθησαν ἐν ταῖς ἐξόδοις· ἐπάγη δέρμα αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τὰ ὀστᾶ αὐτῶν, ἐξηράνθησαν, ἐγενήθησαν ὥσπερ ξύλον.

**Τήθ.**
9   Καλοὶ ἦσαν οἱ τραυματίαι ῥομφαίᾳ, ἢ οἱ τραυματίαι λιμοῦ· ἐπορεύθησαν ἐκκεκεντημένοι ἀπὸ γεννημάτων ἀγρῶν.

**Ἰώδ.**
10  Χεῖρες γυναικῶν οἰκτιρμόνων ἐψήησαν τὰ παιδία αὐτῶν, ἐγεννήθησαν εἰς βρῶσιν αὐταῖς, ἐν τῷ συντρίμματι τῆς θυγατρὸς τοῦ λαοῦ μου.

**Χάφ.**
11  Συνετέλεσε Κύριος θυμὸν αὐτοῦ, ἐξέχεεν ὀργὴν θυμοῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀνῆψε πῦρ ἐν Σιῶν, καὶ κατέφαγε τὰ θεμέλια αὐτῆς.

**Λάμεδ.**
12  Οὐκ ἐπίστευσαν βασιλεῖς γῆς, πάντες οἱ κατοικοῦντες τὴν οἰκουμένην, ὅτι εἰσελεύσεται ἐχθρὸς καὶ ἐκθλίβων διὰ τῶν πυλῶν Ἱερουσαλήμ.

**Μήμ.**
13  Ἐξ ἁμαρτιῶν προφήτων αὐτῆς, ἀδικιῶν ἱερέων αὐτῆς, τῶν ἐκχεόντων αἷμα δίκαιον ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῆς.

**Νοῦν.**
14  Ἐσαλεύθησαν ἐγρήγοροι αὐτῆς ἐν ταῖς ἐξόδοις, ἐμολύνθησαν ἐν αἵματι ἐν τῷ μὴ δύνασθαι αὐτούς, ἅψαντο ἐνδυμάτων αὐτῶν.
