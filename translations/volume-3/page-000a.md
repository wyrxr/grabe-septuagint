ΨΑΛΤΗΡΙΟΝ.
ΨΑΛΜ. Α'. I.
Μακάριος ἀνὴρ ὃς οὐκ ἐπορεύθη ἐν βουλῇ ἀσεβῶν·
Καὶ ἐν ὁδῷ ἁμαρτωλῶν οὐκ ἔστη,
Καὶ ἐπὶ καθέδρᾳ λοιμῶν οὐκ ἐκάθισεν.
2 Ἀλλ' ἢ ἐν τῷ νόμῳ Κυρίου τὸ θέλημα αὐτοῦ,
καὶ ἐν τῷ νόμῳ αὐτοῦ μελετήσει ἡμέρας καὶ νυκτός.
3 Καὶ ἔσται ὡς τὸ ξύλον τὸ πεφυτευμένον παρὰ τὰς διεξόδους τῶν ὑδάτων,
Ὃ τὸν καρπὸν αὑτοῦ δώσει ἐν καιρῷ αὑτοῦ,
Καὶ τὸ φύλλον αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἀποῤῥυήσεται·
καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἂν ποιήσῃ κατευοδωθήσεται.
4 Οὐχ οὕτως οἱ ἀσεβεῖς, οὐχ οὕτως·
Ἀλλ' ἢ ὡς ὁ χνοῦς, ὃν ἐκρίπτει ὁ ἄνεμος ἀπὸ προσώπου τῆς γῆς.
5 Διὰ τοῦτο οὐκ ἀναστήσονται ἀσεβεῖς ἐν κρίσει,
Οὐδὲ οἱ ἁμαρτωλοὶ ἐν βουλῇ δικαίων.
6 Ὅτι γινώσκει Κύριος ὁδὸν δικαίων,
Καὶ ὁδὸς ἀσεβῶν ἀπολεῖται.
ΨΑΛΜ. Β'. II.
Iνατὶ ἐφρύαξαν ἔθνη, καὶ λαοὶ ἐμελήτησαν κενά;
2 Παρέστησαν οἱ βασιλεῖς τῆς γῆς,
Καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες συνήχθησαν ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ
Κατὰ τοῦ Κυρίου καὶ κατὰ τοῦ Χριστοῦ αὐτοῦ.
3 Διάῤῥημα
Διαῤῥήξωμεν τοὺς δεσμοὺς αὐτῶν,
Καὶ ἀποῤῥίψωμεν ἀφ' ἡμῶν τὸν ζυγὸν αὐτῶν.
4 Ὁ κατοικῶν ἐν οὐρανοῖς, ἐγγελáσεται αὐτοὺς,
Καὶ ὁ Κύριος ἐκμυκτηριεῖ αὐτούς.
5 Τότε λαλήσει πρὸς αὐτοὺς ἐν ὀργῇ αὑτοῦ
Καὶ ἐν τῷ θυμῷ αὑτοῦ ταράξει αὐτούς.
6 Ἐγὼ δὲ κατεστάθην βασιλεὺς ὑπ' αὐτοῦ
Ἐπὶ Σιὼν ὄρος τὸ ἅγιον αὐτοῦ,
7 Διαγγέλλων τὸ πρόσταγμα Κυρίου.
Κύριος εἶπε πρός με· υἱός μου εἶ σὺ,
Ἐγὼ σήμερον γεγέννηκά σε.
8 Αἴτησαι παρ' ἐμοῦ, καὶ δώσω σοι
Ἔθνη τὴν κληρονομίαν σου
Καὶ τὴν κατάσχεσίν σου τὰ πέρατα τῆς γῆς.
9 Ποιμανεῖς αὐτοὺς ἐν ῥάβδῳ σιδηρᾷ,
Καὶ ὡς σκεύη κεραμέως συντρίψεις αὐτούς.
10 Καὶ νῦν βασιλεῖς σύνετε,
Παιδεύθητε (πάντες) οἱ κρίνοντες τὴν γῆν.
11 Δουλεύσατε τῷ Κυρίῳ ἐν φόβῳ,
Καὶ ἀγαλλιᾶσθε αὐτῷ ἐν τρόμῳ.
12 Δράξασθε παιδείας μήποτε ὀργισθῇ Κύριος,
Καὶ

## THE PSALTER.

## PSALM I.

**1** Blessed is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly,
Nor stood in the way of sinners,
Nor sat in the seat of scoffers.
**2** But his delight is in the Law of the Lord;
And in His Law doth he meditate day and night.
**3** And he shall be like a tree that is planted by the channels of waters,
Which bringeth forth its fruit in its season;
And its leaf shall not wither;
And whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.
**4** Not so the ungodly, not so;
But they are as the chaff which the wind scattereth away from the face of the earth.
**5** Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in judgment,
Nor sinners in the counsel of the righteous.
**6** For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous,
But the way of the ungodly shall perish.

## PSALM II.

**1** Why do the nations rage,
And the peoples imagine vain things?
**2** The kings of the earth have stood up,
And the rulers have gathered themselves together as one,
Against the Lord, and against His Christ.
**3** A Declaration.
"Let us break their bonds asunder,
And cast away their yoke from us!"
**4** He that dwelleth in the heavens shall laugh at them;
And the Lord shall hold them in derision.
**5** Then shall He speak unto them in His wrath,
And in His hot displeasure shall He trouble them.
**6** "But I have been set up as King by Him
Upon Zion, His holy mountain."
**7** I will declare the decree of the Lord:
The Lord hath said unto me, "Thou art My Son;
This day have I begotten thee.
**8** Ask of Me, and I shall give thee the nations for thine inheritance,
And for thy possession the uttermost parts of the earth.
**9** Thou shalt rule them with a rod of iron;
Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessels."
**10** And now, O kings, understand:
Be instructed, [all] ye that judge the earth.
**11** Serve the Lord with fear,
And rejoice in Him with trembling.
**12** Lay hold of instruction, lest the Lord be angry,
And...
