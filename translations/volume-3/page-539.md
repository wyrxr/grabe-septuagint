    ΕΙΔΟΝ τὸν Κύριον ἐφεστῶτα ἐπὶ τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου, καὶ 1
    εἶπε· πάταξον ἐπὶ τὸ ἱλαστήριον, καὶ σεισθήσεται τὰ πρόπυλα,
    καὶ διάκοψον εἰς κεφαλὰς πάντων· καὶ τοὺς καταλοίπους αὐτῶν
    ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ ἀποκτενῶ, οὐ μὴ διαφεύγῃ ἐξ αὐτῶν φεύγων, οὐδὲ
    μὴ διασωθῇ ἐξ αὐτῶν ἀνασωζόμενος. Ἐὰν κατορυγῶσιν εἰς ἅδου, 2
    ἐκεῖθεν ἡ χείρ μου ἀνασπάσει αὐτούς· καὶ ἐὰν ἀναβῶσιν εἰς τὸν
    οὐρανόν, ἐκεῖθεν κατάξω αὐτούς· ἐὰν ἐγκρυβῶσιν εἰς τὴν κορυ- 3
    φὴν τοῦ Καρμήλου, ἐκεῖθεν ἐξερευνήσω, καὶ λήψομαι αὐτούς· καὶ
    ἐὰν καταδύσωσιν ἐξ ὀφθαλμῶν μου εἰς τὰ βάθη τῆς θαλάσσης, ἐκεῖ
    ἐντελοῦμαι τῷ δράκοντι, καὶ δήξεται αὐτούς· καὶ ἐὰν πορευθῶσιν 4
    ἐν αἰχμαλωσίᾳ πρὸ προσώπου τῶν ἐχθρῶν αὐτῶν, ἐκεῖ ἐντελοῦ-
    μαι τῇ ῥομφαίᾳ, καὶ ἀποκτενεῖ αὐτούς· καὶ στηριῶ τοὺς ὀφθαλ-
    μούς μου ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς εἰς κακά, καὶ οὐκ εἰς ἀγαθά. Καὶ Κύριος 5
    Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὁ παντοκράτωρ, ὁ ἐφαπτόμενος τῆς γῆς, καὶ σαλεύ-
    ων αὐτήν, καὶ πενθήσουσι πάντες οἱ κατοικοῦντες αὐτήν, καὶ
    ἀναβήσεται ὡς ποταμὸς συντέλεια αὐτῆς, καὶ καταβήσεται ὡς
    ποταμὸς Αἰγύπτου· ὁ οἰκοδομῶν εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν ἀνάβασιν αὐτοῦ, 6
    καὶ τὴν ἐπαγγελίαν αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ γῆς θεμελιῶν, ὁ προσκαλούμενος
    τὸ ὕδωρ τῆς θαλάσσης, καὶ ἐκχέων αὐτὸ ἐπὶ πρόσωπον τῆς γῆς·
    Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὁ παντοκράτωρ ὄνομα αὐτῷ. Οὐχ ὡς υἱοὶ Αἰ- 7
    θιόπων ὑμεῖς ἐστὲ ἐμοὶ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ; λέγει Κύριος· οὐ τὸν Ἰσραὴλ
    ἀνήγαγον ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, καὶ τοὺς ἀλλοφύλους ἐκ Καππαδο-
    κίας, καὶ τοὺς Σύρους ἐκ βόθρου; Ἰδοὺ οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ Κυρίου τοῦ 8
    Θεοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν βασιλείαν τῶν ἁμαρτωλῶν, καὶ ἐξαρῶ αὐτὴν ἀπὸ
    προσώπου τῆς γῆς· πλὴν ὅτι οὐκ εἰς τέλος ἐξαρῶ τὸν οἶκον Ἰα-
    κώβ, λέγει Κύριος. Διότι ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐντέλλομαι, καὶ λικμῶ ἐν 9
    πᾶσι τοῖς ἔθνεσι τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, ὃν τρόπον λικμᾶται ἐν τῷ
    λικμῷ, καὶ οὐ μὴ πέσῃ σύντριμμα ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν· ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ τε- 10
    λευτήσουσι πάντες ἁμαρτωλοὶ λαοῦ μου, οἱ λέγοντες· οὐ μὴ ἐγ-
    γίσῃ, οὐδ᾿ οὐ μὴ γένηται ἐφ᾿ ἡμᾶς τὰ κακά. Ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκεί- 11
    νῃ ἀναστήσω τὴν σκηνὴν Δαυΐδ τὴν πεπτωκυῖαν, καὶ ἀνοικοδομή-
    σω τὰ πεπτωκότα αὐτῆς, καὶ τὰ κατεσκαμμένα αὐτῆς ἀναστήσω,
    καὶ ἀνοικοδομήσω αὐτὴν καθὼς αἱ ἡμέραι τοῦ αἰῶνος· ὅπως ἂν 12
    ἐκζητήσωσιν οἱ κατάλοιποι τῶν ἀνθρώπων με καὶ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη,
    ἐφ᾽ οὓς ἐπικέκληται τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς, λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς
    ὁ ποιῶν ταῦτα. Ἰδοὺ ἡμέραι ἔρχονται, λέγει Κύριος, καὶ κατα- 13
    λήψεται ὁ ἀλοητὸς τὸν τρυγητὴν, καὶ περκάσει ἡ σταφυλὴ ἐν τῷ
    σπόρῳ, καὶ ἀποσταλάξει τὰ ὄρη γλυκασμὸν, καὶ πάντες οἱ βου-
    νοὶ σύμφυτοι ἔσονται· καὶ ἐπιστρέψω τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν τοῦ λαοῦ 14
    μου Ἰσραήλ, καὶ οἰκοδομήσουσι πόλεις τὰς ἠφανισμένας, καὶ κα-
    τοικήσουσι, καὶ καταφυτεύσουσι ἀμπελῶνας, καὶ πίονται τὸν οἶ-
    νον αὐτῶν, καὶ ποιήσουσι κήπους, καὶ φάγονται τὸν καρπὸν αὐ-
    τῶν· καὶ καταφυτεύσω αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς αὐτῶν, καὶ οὐ μὴ 15
    ἐκσπασθῶσιν οὐκέτι ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς αὐτῶν, ἧς ἔδωκα αὐτοῖς, λέγει
    Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὁ παντοκράτωρ.

    **CHAPTER 9**

    **1** I saw the Lord standing upon the altar; and He said, "Smite upon the mercy seat, and the vestibules shall shake; and cut through unto the heads of all; and the remnant of them will I slay with the sword. No fugitive shall flee from among them, neither shall any rescued one be saved from among them.
    **2** Though they dig themselves down into Hades, thence shall My hand draw them up; and though they ascend into heaven, thence will I bring them down.
    **3** And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, thence will I search them out, and take them; and though they sink themselves out of My sight into the depths of the sea, there will I command the dragon, and it shall bite them.
    **4** And though they go into captivity before the face of their enemies, there will I command the sword, and it shall slay them. And I will set My eyes upon them for evil, and not for good."
    **5** And the Lord, even the Lord, the God Almighty, He who toucheth the earth and shaketh it, and all that dwell therein shall mourn; and its utter destruction shall rise up as a river, and shall come down as the river of Egypt.
    **6** He who buildeth His upper chambers in heaven, and establisheth His promise upon the earth; He who calleth for the water of the sea, and poureth it out upon the face of the earth: The Lord God Almighty is His Name.
    **7** "Are ye not as the children of the Ethiopians unto Me, O children of Israel?" saith the Lord. "Did I not bring up Israel out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines out of Cappadocia, and the Syrians out of a pit?
    **8** Behold, the eyes of the Lord God are upon the kingdom of sinners, and I will remove it from the face of the earth; nevertheless, I will not utterly remove the house of Jacob," saith the Lord.
    **9** "For behold, I give command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations, as [grain] is sifted in the sieve, and no broken kernel shall fall to the earth.
    **10** All the sinners of My people shall die by the sword, who say, 'The evils shall not draw near, nor shall they by any means come upon us.'
    **11** In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and I will rebuild its fallen parts, and its demolished places will I raise up; and I will rebuild it as in the days of old;
    **12** so that the remnant of men may seek Me, and all the nations, upon whom My Name is called upon them," saith the Lord God, who doeth these things.
    **13** "Behold, the days come," saith the Lord, "when the thresher shall overtake the grape-gatherer, and the grape shall ripen in the sowing season; and the mountains shall drip sweetness, and all the hills shall be fruitful.
    **14** And I will turn the captivity of My people Israel, and they shall build the waste cities and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards and drink the wine thereof; and they shall make gardens and eat the fruit thereof.
    **15** And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no longer be pulled up from their land which I have given them," saith the Lord God Almighty.
