5 θήσονται πᾶσαι αἱ θυγατέρες τοῦ ἄσματος· καὶ γε ἀπὸ ὕψους ὄψονται, καὶ θάμβοι ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ, καὶ ἀνθήσει τὸ ἀμύγδαλον, καὶ παχυνθῇ ἡ ἀκρίς, καὶ διασκεδασθῇ ἡ κάππαρις· ὅτι ἐπορεύθη ὁ ἄνθρωπος εἰς οἶκον αἰῶνος αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐκύκλωσαν ἐν ἀγορᾷ οἱ κοπτό6 μενοι· ἕως ὅτου μὴ ἀνατραπῇ σχοινίον τοῦ ἀργυρίου, καὶ συνθλιβῇ τὸ ἀνθέμιον τοῦ χρυσίου, καὶ συντριβῇ ἡ ὑδρία ἐπὶ τὴν πηγήν, 7 καὶ συντροχάσῃ ὁ τροχὸς ἐπὶ τὸν λάκκον· καὶ ἐπιστρέφει ὁ χοῦς ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ὡς ἦν, καὶ τὸ πνεῦμα ἐπιστρέψει πρὸς τὸν Θεὸν ὃς 8 ἔδωκεν αὐτό. Ματαιότης ματαιοτήτων, εἶπεν ὁ ἐκκλησιαστής, τὰ 9 πάντα ματαιότης. Καὶ περισσὸν, ὅτι ἐγένετο (ὁ) ἐκκλησιαστὴς σοφὸς, (καὶ) ἔτι ἐδίδαξε γνῶσιν σὺν τὸν ἄνθρωπον· καὶ οὖς ἐξιχνιά10 σεται κόσμιον παραβολῶν. Πολλὰ ἐζήτησεν ἐκκλησιαστὴς τοῦ εὑρεῖν λόγους θελήματος, καὶ γεγραμμένον εὐθύτητος, λόγους ἀλη11 θείας. Λόγοι σοφῶν ὡς τὰ βούκεντρα, καὶ ὡς ἧλοι πεφυτευμένοι, 12 οἳ παρὰ τῶν συναγμάτων ἐδόθησαν ἐκ ποιμένος ἑνός. Καὶ περισσὸν ἐξ αὐτῶν υἱέ μου φυλάσσου· τοῦ ποιῆσαι βιβλία πολλὰ οὐκ ἔστι 13 περασμός, καὶ μελέτη πολλὴ κόπωσις σαρκός. Τέλος λόγου τὸ πᾶν ἄκουε· τὸν Θεὸν φοβοῦ, καὶ τὰς ἐντολὰς αὐτοῦ φύλασσε, ὅτι 14 τοῦτο πᾶς ὁ ἄνθρωπος· ὅτι σὺν πᾶν τὸ ποίημα ἄξει ὁ Θεὸς ἐν κρίσει ἐν παντὶ παρεωραμένῳ, ἐὰν ἀγαθὸν καὶ ἐὰν πονηρόν.

**CHAPTER 12**

**5** [And] all the daughters of song shall be brought low;
    and also from on high shall they look forth,
    and terrors shall be in the way;
    and the almond tree shall blossom,
    and the grasshopper shall be a burden,
    and the caper berry shall be scattered;
    for man goeth to his eternal home,
    and the mourners go about in the street.
**6** Ere ever the silver cord be snapped,
    or the golden bowl be broken,
    or the pitcher be shattered at the fountain,
**7** Or the wheel be broken at the cistern.
    Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was,
    and the spirit shall return unto God Who gave it.
**8** Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher;
    all is vanity.
**9** And furthermore, because (the) Preacher became wise,
    (and) he still taught knowledge to mankind;
    and he shall seek out ears [for] a seemly order of proverbs.
**10** The Preacher sought out many things
    to find words of delight,
    and a writing of uprightness,
    [even] words of truth.
**11** The words of the wise are as goads,
    and as nails firmly fixed,
    which were given from the masters of assemblies,
    from one Shepherd.
**12** And furthermore, my son, beware of them:
    of making many books there is no end;
    and much study is a weariness of the flesh.
**13** The end of the whole matter, hear it:
    Fear God, and keep His commandments;
    for this is the whole [duty] of man.
**14** For God shall bring every work into judgment,
    with every hidden thing,
    whether it be good, or whether it be evil.
