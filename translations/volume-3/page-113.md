**ΨΑΛΜ. ΡΝ'. CL.**
Ψαλτηρίῳ καὶ κιθάρᾳ· αἰνεῖτε αὐτὸν ἐν τυμπάνῳ καὶ χορῷ, αἰνεῖτε 4
αὐτὸν ἐν χορδαῖς καὶ ὀργάνῳ· αἰνεῖτε αὐτὸν ἐν κυμβάλοις 5
εὐήχοις, αἰνεῖτε αὐτὸν ἐν κυμβάλοις ἀλαλαγμοῦ. Πᾶσα πνοὴ αἰ- 6
νεσάτω τὸν Κύριον. Ἀλληλούϊα.

ΟΥΤΟΣ ὁ ψαλμὸς ἰδιόγραφος τοῦ Δαυίδ, καὶ ἔξωθεν τοῦ
ἀριθμοῦ, ὅτε ἐμονομάχησε πρὸς τὸν Γολιάθ. Μικρὸς ἤμην ἐν τοῖς
ἀδελφοῖς μου, καὶ νεώτερος ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ πατρός μου· ἐποίμαινον
τὰ πρόβατα τοῦ πατρός μου· αἱ χεῖρές μου ἐποίησαν ὄργανον,
οἱ δάκτυλοί μου ἥρμοσαν ψαλτήριον. Καὶ τίς ἀναγγελεῖ τῷ Κυ-
ρίῳ μου; αὐτὸς Κύριος, αὐτὸς εἰσακούσεταί μου· αὐτὸς ἐξαπέστειλε
τὸν ἄγγελον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἤρεέ με ἐκ τῶν προβάτων τοῦ πατρός
μου, καὶ ἔχρισέ με ἐν τῷ ἐλαίῳ τῆς χρίσεως αὐτοῦ. Οἱ δὲ ἀδελ-
φοί μου καλοὶ καὶ μεγάλοι· καὶ οὐκ εὐδόκησεν ἐν αὐτοῖς ὁ Κύριος.
Ἐξῆλθον εἰς συνάντησιν τῷ ἀλλοφύλῳ, καὶ ἐπικατηράσατό με ἐν
τοῖς εἰδώλοις αὐτοῦ· ἐγὼ δὲ σπασάμενος τὴν παρ᾿ ἐκείνου μάχαι-
ραν, ἀπεκεφάλισα αὐτόν, καὶ ἦρα ὄνειδος ἐξ υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ.

ὨΔΗ Μωυσέως ἐν τῇ ἐξόδῳ. Ἄσω μὲν τῷ Κυρίῳ, ἐνδόξως 1
γὰρ δεδόξασται· ἵππον καὶ ἀναβάτην ἔρριψεν εἰς θάλασσαν. Βοη- 2
θὸς καὶ σκεπαστὴς ἐγένετό μοι εἰς σωτηρίαν· οὗτος Θεός μου, καὶ
δοξάσω αὐτόν· Θεὸς τοῦ πατρός μου, καὶ ὑψώσω αὐτόν. Κύριος 3
συντρίβων πολέμους· Κύριος ὄνομα αὐτῷ. Ἄρματα Φαραὼ καὶ 4
τὴν δύναμιν αὐτοῦ ἔρριψεν εἰς θάλασσαν· ἐπιλέκτους ἀναβάτας
τριστάτας κατεπόντισεν ἐν ἐρυθρᾷ θαλάσσῃ, πόντῳ ἐκάλυψεν αὐ- 5
τούς· κατέδυσαν εἰς βυθὸν ὡσεὶ λίθος. Ἡ δεξιά σου Κύριε δεδό- 6
ξασται ἐν ἰσχύϊ· ἡ δεξιά σου χεὶρ Κύριε ἔθραυσεν ἐχθρούς. Καὶ 7
τῷ πλήθει τῆς δόξης σου συνέτριψας τοὺς ὑπεναντίους· ἀπέστει-
λας τὴν ὀργήν σου, καὶ κατέφαγεν αὐτοὺς ὡς καλάμην. Καὶ διὰ 8
πνεύματος τοῦ θυμοῦ σου διέστη τὸ ὕδωρ· ἐπάγη ὡσεὶ τεῖχος τὰ
ὕδατα,

**PSALM 150 (LXX 150) [continued].**
    psaltery and harp.
**4** Praise Him with timbrel and dance;
    praise Him with strings and organ.
**5** Praise Him with clear-sounding cymbals;
    praise Him with cymbals of jubilant acclamation.
**6** Let every breath praise the Lord.
    Alleluia.

**PSALM 151 (LXX 151).**
*This psalm is an autograph of David, and outside the number,
when he fought in single combat against Goliath.*
**1** Small was I among my brethren,
    and the youngest in my father's house.
    I tended my father’s sheep;
    my hands did fashion a musical instrument,
    my fingers did tune a psaltery.
**2** And who shall declare [these things] to my Lord?
    The Lord Himself, He Himself shall hear me.
    He sent forth His angel,
    and did take me from my father’s sheep,
    and anointed me with the oil of His anointing.
**3** But my brethren were comely and great;
    yet the Lord took no pleasure in them.
**4** I went forth to meet the foreigner,
    and he cursed me by his idols.
**5** But I, drawing the sword from him,
    did behead him, and took away the reproach from the sons of Israel.

**The First Ode: The Song of Moses in the Exodus.**
**1** I will sing unto the Lord,
    for He hath been gloriously glorified;
    horse and rider hath He cast into the sea.
**2** A Helper and a Protector hath He become to me for salvation;
    this is my God, and I will glorify Him;
    the God of my father, and I will exalt Him.
**3** The Lord Who shattereth wars;
    the Lord is His Name.
**4** Pharaoh’s chariots and his host hath He cast into the sea;
    His chosen, three-deep riders hath He sunk in the Red Sea.
**5** The deep hath covered them;
    they sank into the abyss like a stone.
**6** Thy right hand, O Lord, is glorified in strength;
    Thy right hand, O Lord, hath shattered enemies.
**7** And by the multitude of Thy glory hast Thou crushed Thine adversaries;
    Thou didst send forth Thy wrath, and it consumed them like stubble.
**8** And by the breath of Thy wrath the water was parted;
    the waters stood fixed like a wall,
