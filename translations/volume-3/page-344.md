3  Ἰσραὴλ, λέγων· γράψον σεαυτῷ πάντας τοὺς λόγους, οὓς ἐγὼ
    ἐχρημάτισα πρὸς σὲ ἐπὶ βιβλίου. Ὅτι ἰδοὺ ἡμέραι ἔρχονται, φησὶ
    Κύριος, καὶ ἀποστρέψω τὴν ἀποικίαν λαοῦ μου Ἰσραὴλ καὶ Ἰού-
    δα, εἶπε Κύριος παντοκράτωρ, καὶ ἀποστρέψω αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν
4  γῆν, ἣν ἔδωκα τοῖς πατράσιν αὐτῶν, καὶ κυριεύσουσιν αὐτῆς. ΚΑΙ
    ΟΥΤΟΙ ΟΙ ΛΟΓΟΙ ΟΥΣ ΕΛΑΛΗΣΕΝ ΚΥΡΙΟΣ ΕΠΙ ΙΣ-
5  ΡΑΗΛ ΚΑΙ ΙΟΥΔΑ. Οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος· φωνὴν φόβου ἀ-
6  κούσεσθε· φόβος, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν εἰρήνη. Ἐρωτήσατε, καὶ ἴδετε,
    εἰ ἔτεκεν ἄρσεν; καὶ περὶ φόβου ἐν ᾧ καθεζοῦσιν ὀσφῦν καὶ σω-
    τηρίαν; διότι ἑώρακα πάντα ἄνθρωπον, καὶ αἱ χεῖρες αὐτοῦ
    ἐπὶ τῆς ὀσφύος αὐτοῦ, ὡς τικτούσης· ἐστράφησαν πάντα πρό-
7  σωπα εἰς ἴκτερον. Ἐγενήθη, ὅτι μεγάλη ἡ ἡμέρα ἐκείνη, καὶ
8  οὐκ ἔστι τοιαύτη, καὶ χρόνος στενός ἐστι τῷ Ἰακώβ, καὶ ἀπὸ
    τούτου σωθήσεται· ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, εἶπε Κύριος, συντρίψω
    ζυγὸν ἀπὸ τραχήλου αὐτῶν, καὶ τοὺς δεσμοὺς διαρρήξω· καὶ οὐκ
9  ἐργῶνται αὐτοὶ ἔτι ἐν ἀλλοτρίοις, καὶ ἐργῶνται τῷ Κυρίῳ Θεῷ
    αὐτῶν, καὶ τὸν Δαβὶδ τὸν βασιλέα αὐτῶν ἀναστήσω αὐτοῖς.
10  Σὺ δὲ μὴ φοβοῦ, παῖς μου Ἰακώβ, φησὶ Κύριος, μηδὲ δειλιάσῃς
    Ἰσραήλ· ὅτι ἰδοὺ σώζω σε μακρόθεν, καὶ τὸ σπέρμα σου ἀπὸ γῆς
    αἰχμαλωσίας αὐτῶν· καὶ ἐπιστρέψει Ἰακώβ, καὶ ἡσυχάσει, καὶ
11  εὐπαθήσει, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ὁ ἐκφοβῶν. Ὅτι μετὰ σοῦ ἐγώ εἰμι,
    φησὶ Κύριος, τοῦ σώζειν σε· ὅτι ποιήσω ἔκλειψιν ἐν πᾶσι ταῖς
    ἔθνεσιν, εἰς οὓς διεσκόρπισά σε ἐκεῖ· πλὴν σέ οὐ ποιήσω εἰς ἔκλει-
    ψιν, καὶ παιδεύσω σε εἰς κρίσιν, καὶ ἀθωῶν οὐκ ἀθωώσω σε.
12  Οὕτως λέγει Κύριος· ἀνέστησα σύντριμμά σου, ἀλγηρὰ ἡ πλη-
13  γή σου, οὐκ ἔστιν κρίνων κρίσιν σου, εἰς ἀλγηρὸν ἰατρεύθης, ὠφέ-
14  λεια οὐκ ἔστι σοι. Πάντες οἱ φίλοι σου ἐπελάθοντό σου, οὐ μὴ
    ἐπερωτήσωσι περὶ σοῦ· ὅτι πληγὴν ἐχθροῦ ἔπαισά σε, παιδείαν
    στερεὰν, ἐπὶ πᾶσαν ἀδικίαν σου ἐπλήθυναν αἱ ἁμαρτίαι σου.
15  Τί βοᾷς ἐπὶ τὸ σύντριμμά σου; βίαιον τὸ ἄλγος σου διὰ πλῆθος
    ἀνομιῶν σου· ὅτι ἴσχυσαν αἱ ἁμαρτίαι σου, ἐποίησά σοι ταῦτα.
16  Διὰ τοῦτο πάντες οἱ ἔσθοντές σε βρωθήσονται, καὶ πάντες οἱ
    ἐχθροί σου κρέας αὐτῶν πᾶν ἔδονται· ἐπὶ πλῆθος ἀδικίας σου ἐ-
    πληθύνθησαν αἱ ἁμαρτίαι σου, ἐποίησαν ταῦτά σοι· καὶ ἔσονται
    οἱ διαφοροῦντές σε εἰς διαφόρημα, καὶ πάντας τοὺς προνομεύον-
17  τάς σε δώσω εἰς προνομήν. Ὅτι ἀνάξω τὸ ἴαμά σου, ἀπὸ πλη-

**JEREMIAH CHAPTER 37**
(Hebrew Chapter 30)

**3** Israel, saying: 'Write for thyself all the words which I have spoken unto thee upon a book. For behold, the days are coming,' saith the Lord, 'and I shall turn back the captivity of My people Israel and Judah,' saith the Lord Almighty; 'and I shall return them unto the land which I gave unto their fathers, and they shall possess it.'
**4** AND THESE ARE THE WORDS WHICH THE LORD HATH SPOKEN CONCERNING ISRAEL AND JUDAH.
**5** Thus saith the Lord: 'A voice of fear shall ye hear; fear, and there is no peace.'
**6** Ask ye now, and behold, if a male hath given birth? And concerning fear, in which they shall sit [with] loin and salvation? Because I have seen every man, and his hands are upon his loins, as one that travaileth; all faces are turned to a sickly paleness.
**7** 'It came to pass, that great is that day, and there is none like it; and it is a time of distress for Jacob, but from this shall he be saved.'
**8** In that day, saith the Lord, 'I shall break the yoke from their neck, and I shall burst their bonds;
**9** and they shall no longer serve among strangers, but they shall serve the Lord their God, and I shall raise up David their king unto them.'
**10** But thou, My servant Jacob, fear not, saith the Lord, neither be thou dismayed, O Israel; for behold, I save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall rest, and shall prosper, and there shall be none to make him afraid.
**11** For I am with thee, saith the Lord, to save thee; for I shall make a full end of all the nations, among whom I have scattered thee there; but thee will I not make a full end of; and I shall chasten thee in judgment, and I will not altogether leave thee unpunished.
**12** Thus saith the Lord: 'I have raised up thy crushing; thy wound is grievous,
**13** there is none to judge thy cause; thou wast treated unto a painful [state], [and] there is no benefit for thee.
**14** All thy friends have forgotten thee; they shall not enquire concerning thee; for I have smitten thee with the stroke of an enemy, with a stern chastisement; because of all thine iniquity, thy sins were multiplied.
**15** Why criest thou for thy crushing? Violent is thy grief because of the multitude of thine iniquities; because thy sins were strong, I have done these things unto thee.
**16** Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine enemies, all their flesh shall they eat; because of the multitude of thine iniquity, thy sins were multiplied, these things they have done unto thee; and they who shall make division of thee shall be brought unto destruction, and all those who plunder thee shall I give for a spoil.
**17** For I shall bring up thy healing, and I shall heal thee from a painful wound,' saith the Lord;
