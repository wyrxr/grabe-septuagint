ΚΕΦ. ΜΒ΄. ΜΓ΄. IΕΡΕΜΙΑΣ 1295
Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἅπαντα τὰ κακά, ἃ ἐλάλησα ἐπ᾿ αὐτούς· ἀνθ᾿ ὧν
ἐλάλησα πρὸς αὐτούς, καὶ οὐκ ἤκουσαν, καὶ ἐκάλεσα αὐτούς, καὶ
οὐκ ἀπεκρίθησαν. Καὶ τῷ οἴκῳ Ῥηχὰβ εἶπεν Ἱερεμίας· Διὰ τοῦτο 18
οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος τῶν δυνάμεων ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ· Ἐπειδὴ
ἤκουσαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰωναδὰβ υἱοῦ Ῥηχὰβ τὴν ἐντολὴν Ἰωναδὰβ
τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐφύλαξαν συμπάσας τὰς ἐντολὰς αὐτοῦ,
ποιεῖν κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἐνετείλατο αὐτοῖς ὁ πατὴρ αὐτῶν. Διὰ 19
τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Κύριος τῶν δυνάμεων ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ· οὐ μὴ ἐκ-
λείπῃ ἀνὴρ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰωναδὰβ υἱοῦ Ῥηχὰβ παρεστηκὼς κατὰ
πρόσωπόν μου πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς γῆς.

ΚΕΦ. ΜΓ΄. XLIII.

ΚΑὶ ἐγένετο ΕΝ ΤΩ ΕΝΙΑΥΤΩ ΤΩ ΤΕΤΑΡΤΩ ΙΩΑΚΕΙΜ 1
υἱοῦ Ἰωσίου βασιλέως Ἰούδα, ἐγενήθη λόγος Κυρίου
πρὸς μέ, λέγων. Λάβε σεαυτῷ χάρτην βιβλίου, καὶ γράψον 2
ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῦ πάντας τοὺς λόγους, οὓς ἐχρημάτισα πρὸς σὲ ἐπὶ Ἰσραὴλ
καὶ ἐπὶ Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐπὶ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη, ἀφ᾿ ἧς ἡμέρας λαλή-
σαντός μου πρὸς σὲ ἀφ᾿ ἡμερῶν Ἰωσία βασιλέως Ἰούδα, καὶ ἕως
τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης Ἴσως ἀκούσεται οἶκος Ἰούδα πάντα τὰ 3
κακά, ἃ ἐγὼ λογίζομαι ποιῆσαι αὐτοῖς, ἵνα ἀποστραφῶσιν ἕ-
καστος ἀπὸ τῆς ὁδοῦ αὐτοῦ τῆς πονηρᾶς, καὶ ἵλεως ἔσομαι
ταῖς ἀδικίαις αὐτῶν καὶ ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐκάλεσεν 4
Ἱερεμίας τὸν Βαροὺχ υἱὸν Νηρίου, καὶ ἔγραψε Βαροὺχ ἀπὸ στόματος
Ἱερεμίου πάντας τοὺς λόγους Κυρίου, οὓς ἐχρημάτισε πρὸς αὐτὸν
εἰς χαρτίον βιβλίου. Καὶ ἐνετείλατο Ἱερεμίας τῷ Βαρούχ, 5
λέγων· ἐγὼ φυλάσσομαι, καὶ οὐ μὴ δύνομαι εἰσελθεῖν εἰς οἶκον
Κυρίου· καὶ εἰσελεύσῃ σύ, καὶ ἀναγνώσῃ ἐν τῷ χάρτῃ τούτῳ 6
ἐν ᾧ ἔγραψας ἐκ τοῦ στόματός μου τοὺς λόγους Κυρίου, εἰς τὰ
ὦτα τοῦ λαοῦ ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου, ἐν ἡμέρᾳ νηστείας, καὶ ἐν
ὠσὶ παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ Ἰούδα τῶν ἐρχομένων ἐκ πόλεων αὐτῶν,
ἀναγνώσῃ αὐτοῖς. Ἴσως πεσεῖται ἔλεος αὐτῶν κατὰ πρόσωπον 7
Κυρίου, καὶ ἀποστρέψουσιν ἕκαστος ἀπὸ τῆς ὁδοῦ αὐτῶν τῆς πονηρᾶς,
ὅτι μέγας ὁ θυμὸς Κυρίου καὶ ἡ ὀργή, ἣν ἐλάλησε Κύριος
ἐπὶ τὸν λαὸν τοῦτον. Καὶ ἐποίησε Βαροὺχ υἱὸς Νηρίου 8
κατὰ πάντα ἃ ἐνετείλατο αὐτῷ Ἱερεμίας ὁ προφήτης, τοῦ ἀναγνῶναι

**JEREMIAH 42 (Septuagint) / JEREMIAH 35 (Hebrew)**

**17** ...Jerusalem all the evils which I have spoken against them; because I spake unto them, and they hearkened not; and I called them, and they answered not."
**18** And Jeremiah spake unto the house of Rechab, saying, "Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel: 'Forasmuch as the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have hearkened unto the commandment of Jonadab their father, and have kept all his commandments, to do according to all whatsoever their father commanded them;
**19** therefore thus saith the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel: "There shall not fail a man of the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab to stand before My face all the days of the earth."'"

**JEREMIAH 43 (Septuagint) / JEREMIAH 36 (Hebrew)**

**1** Now it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, that the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
**2** "Take thee a scroll of a book, and write therein all the words which I have spoken unto thee concerning Israel, and concerning Judah, and concerning all the nations, from the day I began to speak unto thee, from the days of Josiah the king of Judah, even unto this day.
**3** Peradventure the house of Judah will hearken unto all the evils which I purpose to do unto them, that they may turn back, every man, from his evil way; and I will be merciful unto their iniquities and unto their sins."
**4** So Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah; and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the Lord, which He had spoken unto him, upon a scroll of a book.
**5** And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, "I am shut up, and I cannot enter into the house of the Lord;
**6** but thou shalt go in, and thou shalt read in this scroll, wherein thou hast written from My mouth the words of the Lord, in the ears of the people in the house of the Lord, on a day of fasting; yea, in the ears of all the people of Judah who come out of their cities, thou shalt read unto them.
**7** Peradventure their supplication shall be received before the Lord, and they shall turn back, every man, from his evil way; for great is the wrath of the Lord, and the anger which the Lord hath spoken against this people."
**8** And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, to read [from] the book the words of the Lord in the house of the Lord.
