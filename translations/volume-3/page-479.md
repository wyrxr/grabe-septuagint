αὑτὴν ἐν κύκλῳ, ὑμῖν καὶ τοῖς προσηλύτοις τοῖς παροικοῦσιν ἐν
μέσῳ ὑμῶν, οἵ τινες ἐγέννησαν υἱοὺς ἐν μέσῳ ὑμῶν, καὶ ἔσονται
ὑμῖν ὡς αὐτόχθονες ἐν τοῖς υἱοῖς τοῦ Ἰσραήλ· μεθ’ ὑμῶν φά-
γονται ἐν κληρονομίᾳ ἐν μέσῳ τῶν φυλῶν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἔσονται 23
ἐν φυλῇ προσηλύτων ἐν τοῖς προσηλύτοις μετ’ αὐτῶν· ἐκεῖ δώσετε
κληρονομίαν αὐτοῖς, λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεός.

ἀφορισμοῦ πέντε καὶ εἴκοσι χιλιάδες εὖρος, καὶ μῆκος καθὼς μία
τῶν μερίδων ἀπὸ τῶν πρὸς ἀνατολάς, καὶ ἕως τῶν πρὸς θάλασ-
σαν· καὶ ἔσται τὸ ἅγιον ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῶν ἀπαρχή, ἣν ἀφοριοῦσι 9

καὶ πέντε χιλιάδες. Τούτων ἔσται ἡ ἀπαρχὴ τῶν ἁγίων τοῖς 10
ἱερεῦσι πρὸς βορρᾶν πέντε καὶ εἴκοσι χιλιάδες, καὶ πρὸς θά-
λασσαν πλάτος δέκα χιλιάδες, καὶ πρὸς ἀνατολὰς πλάτος δέκα
χιλιάδες, καὶ πρὸς νότον, μῆκος εἴκοσι καὶ πέντε χιλιάδες, καὶ
τὸ ὄρος τῶν ἁγίων ἔσται ἐν μέσῳ αὐτοῦ τοῖς ἱερεῦσι, τοῖς ἡγια- 11
σμένοις υἱοῖς Σαδδούκ, τοῖς φυλάσσουσι τὰς φυλακὰς τοῦ οἴκου,
οἵ τινες οὐκ ἐπλανήθησαν ἐν τῇ πλανήσει τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, ἐν
ῥοπῇ ἐπλανήθησαν οἱ Λευῖται. Καὶ ἔσται αὐτοῖς ἡ ἀπαρχὴ 12

**Chapter 47**

²² [And it shall be, ye shall cast lots for] it unto yourselves, [both] for you and for the sojourners who dwell in your midst, who have begotten sons in your midst. And they shall be unto you as native-born among the sons of Israel; with you shall they partake in inheritance in the midst of the tribes of Israel.
²³ And they shall be counted in a tribe of sojourners, among the sojourners with them; there shall ye give them an inheritance," saith the Lord God.

**Chapter 48**

¹ Now these are the names of the tribes, from the northern border, by the region of the descent, which separateth unto the entrance of Hamath, [even] the court of Ainon, the border of Damascus toward the north, according to the region of the court of Hamath. And there shall be unto them, from the east side even unto the sea, Dan, one [portion].
² And from the borders of Dan, those toward the east, even unto those toward the sea, Asher, one [portion].
³ And from the borders of Asher, from those toward the east, even unto those toward the sea, Naphtali, one [portion].
⁴ And from the borders of Naphtali, from those toward the east, even unto those toward the sea, Manasseh, one [portion].
⁵ And from the borders of Manasseh, from those toward the east, even unto those toward the sea, Ephraim, one [portion].
⁶ And from the borders of Ephraim, from those toward the east, even unto those toward the sea, Reuben, one [portion].
⁷ And from the borders of Reuben, from those toward the east, even unto those toward the sea, Judah, one [portion].
⁸ And from the borders of Judah, from those toward the east, even unto those toward the sea, shall be the holy oblation, [the portion] set apart, five and twenty thousand [measures] in breadth; and its length, as one of the portions, from those toward the east, even unto those toward the sea.
⁹ And the holy [portion] shall be in the midst thereof [as] an oblation, which they shall separate unto the Lord, in length five and twenty thousand, and in breadth five and twenty thousand.
¹⁰ Of these [portions], the oblation of the holy [places] shall be for the priests: toward the north, five and twenty thousand [in length]; and toward the sea, ten thousand in breadth; and toward the east, ten thousand in breadth; and toward the south, five and twenty thousand in length. And the mountain of the holy [place] shall be in the midst thereof.
¹¹ For the priests, for the consecrated sons of Zadok, who keep the charge of the house, who did not go astray in the straying of the sons of Israel, [even] at the time when the Levites went astray.
¹² And to them shall be the oblation, given from the oblations of the holy [things] of the land, a holy of holies, [separate] from the borders of the Levites.
