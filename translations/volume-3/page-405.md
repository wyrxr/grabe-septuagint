ΚΕΦ. ΙΑʹ. ΙΕΖΕΚΙΗΛ 1343
13 καὶ πίπτω ἐπὶ πρόσωπόν μου, καὶ ἀνεβόησα φωνῇ μεγάλῃ, καὶ εἶπα· Ὤιμοι οἴμοι· Ἀδωναὶ Κύριε, εἰς συντέλειαν σὺ ποιεῖς τοὺς καταλοίπους τοῦ Ἰσραήλ;
14 Καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς μέ, λέγων·
15 Υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, οἱ ἀδελφοί σου καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας σου καὶ πᾶς ὁ οἶκος τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ συντέλεσται, οἷς εἶπαν αὐτοῖς οἱ κατοικοῦντες Ἱερουσαλήμ· μακρὰν ἀπέχετε ἀπὸ τοῦ Κυρίου, ἡμῖν δέδοται ἡ γῆ εἰς κληρονομίαν.
16 Διὰ τοῦτο εἰπόν· Τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναὶ Κύριος· ὅτι ἀπώσομαι αὐτοὺς εἰς τὰ ἔθνη, καὶ διασκορπιῶ αὐτοὺς εἰς πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν, καὶ ἔσομαι αὐτοῖς εἰς ἁγίασμα μικρὸν ἐν ταῖς χώραις, οὗ ἐὰν εἰσέλθωσιν ἐκεῖ.
17 Διὰ τοῦτο εἰπόν· Τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναὶ Κύριος· καὶ εἰσδέξομαι αὐτοὺς ἐκ τῶν ἐθνῶν, καὶ συνάξω αὐτοὺς ἐκ τῶν χωρῶν, οὗ διέσπειρα αὐτοὺς ἐν αὐταῖς, καὶ δώσω αὐτοῖς τὴν γῆν τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ εἰσελεύσονται ἐκεῖ,
18 καὶ ἐξαροῦσι πάντα τὰ βδελύγματα αὐτῆς καὶ πάσας τὰς ἀνομίας αὐτῆς ἐξ αὐτῆς.
19 Καὶ δώσω αὐτοῖς καρδίαν ἑτέραν, καὶ πνεῦμα καινὸν δώσω ἐν αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἐκσπάσω τὴν καρδίαν (αὐτῶν) τὴν λιθίνην ἐκ τῆς σαρκὸς αὐτῶν, καὶ δώσω αὐτοῖς καρδίαν σαρκίνην,
20 ὅπως ἐν τοῖς προστάγμασί μου πορεύωνται, καὶ τὰ δικαιώματά μου φυλάσσωνται, καὶ ποιήσωσιν αὐτά, καὶ ἔσονταί μοι εἰς λαόν, καὶ ἐγὼ ἔσομαι αὐτοῖς εἰς Θεόν, (λέγει Κύριος).
21 Καὶ κατὰ τὰς καρδίας τῶν βδελυγμάτων αὐτῶν καὶ τῶν ἀνομιῶν αὐτῶν καὶ τῶν πονηρῶν ὧν ἐποίησαν, ὡς ἡ καρδία αὐτῶν ἐπορεύετο, τὰς ὁδοὺς αὐτῶν εἰς κεφαλὰς
22 αὐτῶν δέδωκα, λέγει Ἀδωναὶ Κύριος. Καὶ ἐξῆραν τὰ Χερουβεὶμ τὰς πτέρυγας αὐτῶν, καὶ οἱ τροχοὶ ἐχόμενοι αὐτῶν, καὶ ἡ δόξα
23 Θεοῦ Ἰσραὴλ ἦν ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῖς ὑπεράνω αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἀνέβη δόξα Κυρίου ἐκ μέσου τῆς πόλεως, καὶ ἔστη ἐπὶ τοῦ ὄρους, ὃ ἦν ἀπέναντι τῆς πόλεως.
24 Καὶ ἀνέλαβέ με πνεῦμα, καὶ ἤγαγέ με εἰς γῆν Χαλδαίων εἰς τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν ἐν ὁράσει ἐν πνεύματι Θεοῦ· καὶ ἀνέβην ἀπὸ τῆς ὁράσεως, ἧς εἶδον,
25 καὶ ἐλάλησα πρὸς τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν πάντας τοὺς λόγους Κυρίου, οὓς ἔδειξέ μοι (Κύριος).

ΚΕΦ. ΙΒ΄. ΧΙΙ.

1 Καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς μέ, λέγων·
2 Υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, ἐν μέσω τῶν ἀδικιῶν αὐτῶν σὺ κατοικεῖς, οἳ ἔχουσιν ὀφθαλμοὺς τοῦ δρᾷν, καὶ οὐ βλέπουσι, καὶ ὦτα ἔχουσι τοῦ ἀκούειν, καὶ οὐκ ἀκούουσι,

### Chapter 11

**13** And I fell upon my face, and cried aloud with a great voice, and I said, "Alas, alas, O Adonai Lord! Wilt Thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?"
**14** And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
**15** "Son of man, thy brethren, and the men of thy captivity, and all the house of Israel, [whose portion] hath been brought to an end, [even they] unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said to them, 'Be ye far from the Lord; to us is the land given for an inheritance.'
**16** Therefore say, 'Thus saith Adonai the Lord: For I will cast them away among the nations, and I will scatter them into all the earth; yet will I be unto them a little sanctuary in the lands whither they shall come.
**17** Therefore say, 'Thus saith Adonai the Lord: I will even receive them from among the nations, and I will gather them out of the lands where I have scattered them, and I will give them the land of Israel; and they shall enter therein,
**18** and they shall remove all her abominations and all her iniquities out of it.
**19** And I will give them another heart, and a new spirit will I put within them; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh,
**20** that they may walk in My ordinances, and keep My judgments, and do them; and they shall be My people, and I will be their God,' (saith the Lord).
**21** But as for them whose hearts follow the hearts of their abominations and their iniquities and the evil things which they have done, as their heart walked, their ways upon their own heads
**22** have I recompensed, saith Adonai the Lord." And the Cherubim lifted up their wings, and the wheels were beside them, and the glory
**23** of the God of Israel was upon them, over them. And the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which was opposite the city.
**24** And the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me into the land of the Chaldeans, unto the captivity, in a vision by the Spirit of God. And I went up from the vision which I had seen,
**25** and I spake unto the captivity all the words of the Lord, which He had shown me, (even the Lord).

### Chapter 12

**1** And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
**2** "Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of their iniquities; for they have eyes to see, and they see not; and they have ears to hear, and they hear not,
