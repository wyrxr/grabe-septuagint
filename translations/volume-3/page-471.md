1 ΚΑΙ ἐπέστρεψέ με κατὰ τὴν ὁδὸν τῆς πύλης τῶν ἁγίων τῆς ἐξωτέρας, τῆς βλεπούσης κατ᾿ ἀνατολὰς καὶ αὕτη ἦν κεκλεισμένη.
2 Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρός με· ἡ πύλη αὕτη κεκλεισμένη ἔσται, οὐκ ἀνοιχθήσεται, καὶ οὐδεὶς μὴ διέλθῃ δι᾿ αὐτῆς· ὅτι Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ εἰσελεύσεται δι᾿ αὐτῆς, καὶ ἔσται κεκλεισμένη.
3 Διότι ὁ ἡγούμενος οὗτος καθήσεται ἐν αὐτῇ, τοῦ φαγεῖν ἄρτον ἐναντίον Κυρίου· κατὰ τὴν ὁδὸν Αἰλὰμ τῆς πύλης εἰσελεύσεται, καὶ κατὰ τὴν ὁδὸν αὐτοῦ ἐξελεύσεται.
4 Καὶ εἰσήγαγέ με κατὰ τὴν ὁδὸν τῆς πύλης τῆς πρὸς βορρᾶν, κατέναντι τοῦ οἴκου· καὶ ἴδον, καὶ ἰδοὺ πλήρης δόξης ὁ οἶκος Κυρίου· καὶ πίπτω ἐπὶ πρόσωπόν μου.
5 Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρός με· υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, τάξον εἰς τὴν καρδίαν σου, καὶ ἴδε τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς σου, καὶ τοῖς ὠσί σου ἄκουε πάντα, ὅσα ἐγὼ λαλῶ μετὰ σοῦ, κατὰ πάντα τὰ προστάγματα οἴκου Κυρίου, καὶ κατὰ πάντα τὰ νόμιμα αὐτοῦ· καὶ τάξεις τὴν καρδίαν σου εἰς τὴν εἴσοδον τοῦ οἴκου, κατὰ πάσας τὰς ἐξόδους αὐτοῦ, ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς ἁγίοις.
6 Καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς τὸν οἶκον τὸν παραπικραίνοντα, πρὸς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Ἰσραήλ· τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεός· ἱκανούσθω ὑμῖν ἀπὸ πασῶν τῶν ἀνομιῶν ὑμῶν, οἶκος τοῦ Ἰσραήλ,
7 τοῦ εἰσαγαγεῖν ὑμᾶς υἱοὺς ἀλλογενεῖς, ἀπεριτμήτους καρδίᾳ, καὶ ἀπεριτμήτους σαρκί, τοῦ γίνεσθαι ἐν τοῖς ἁγίοις μου, καὶ βεβηλοῦν αὐτὰ τὸν οἶκον ἐν τῷ προσφέρειν ὑμᾶς ἄρτους μου, καὶ σάρκας καὶ αἷμα· καὶ παρεβαίνετε τὴν διαθήκην μου ἐν πάσαις ταῖς ἀνομίαις ὑμῶν,
8 καὶ οὐκ ἐφυλάξατε τὴν φυλακὴν τῶν ἁγίων μου, καὶ διετάξατε τοῦ φυλάσσειν φυλακὰς ἐν τοῖς ἁγίοις μου.
9 Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεός· πᾶς υἱὸς ἀλλογενὴς ἀπερίτμητος καρδίᾳ, καὶ ἀπερίτμητος σαρκί, οὐκ εἰσελεύσεται εἰς τὰ ἅγιά μου ἐν πᾶσιν υἱοῖς ἀλλογενῶν, τῶν ὄντων ἐν μέσω οἴκου Ἰσραήλ,
10 ἀλλ᾿ ἢ οἱ Λευῖται, οἵτινες ἀφήλαντο ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ ἐν τῷ πλανᾶσθαι τὸν Ἰσραήλ, οἳ ἐπλανήθησαν ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ κατόπισθεν τῶν ἐνθυμημάτων αὐτῶν·
11 καὶ λήψονται τὴν ἀδικίαν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔσονται ἐν τοῖς ἁγίοις μου λειτουργοῦντες, θυρωροὶ ἐπὶ τῶν πυλῶν τοῦ οἴκου, καὶ λειτουργοῦντες τῷ οἴκῳ Κυρίου, οὗτοι σφάξουσι τὰ ὁλοκαυτώματα καὶ τὰς θυσίας τῷ λαῷ, καὶ οὗτοι στήσονται ἐναντίον τοῦ λαοῦ τοῦ

**Chapter 44**

1 Then did he bring me back the way of the outer gate of the holy [place], which looketh toward the east; and it was shut.
2 And the Lord said unto me: "This gate shall be shut, and it shall not be opened; neither shall any man pass through it. For the Lord God of Israel shall enter by it, and it shall remain shut.
3 For the prince, he shall sit within it, to eat bread before the Lord; he shall enter by the way of the porch, [even the] Ailam of the gate, and by his own way shall he go forth."
4 Then brought he me the way of the gate that looketh toward the north, before the House; and I looked, and, behold, the House of the Lord was full of glory; and I fell upon my face.
5 And the Lord said unto me: "Son of man, set thy heart, and behold with thine eyes, and with thine ears give heed to all things which I speak with thee, concerning all the ordinances of the House of the Lord, and all its statutes. And thou shalt set thy heart upon the entrance of the House, and upon all its outgoing ways, and within all the holy places [thereof].
6 And thou shalt say unto the rebellious house, even unto the House of Israel, 'Thus saith the Lord God: Let it suffice you of all your iniquities, O House of Israel;
7 in that ye have brought in sons of strangers, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in My holy places, and to profane them, [even] the House, when ye did offer My breads, and flesh and blood. And ye have transgressed My covenant in all your iniquities,
8 and ye have not kept the charge of My holy things; but ye have appointed [others] to keep charges in My holy places.
9 Therefore thus saith the Lord God: No son of a stranger, uncircumcised in heart, nor uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into My sanctuary, [among] all the sons of strangers who are in the midst of the House of Israel;
10 save only the Levites, who went far from Me when Israel went astray, who strayed from Me after their own devices;
11 and they shall bear their iniquity. Yet they shall be in My holy places ministering, doorkeepers at the gates of the House, and ministering to the House of the Lord. These shall slaughter the burnt offerings and the sacrifices for the people, and these shall stand before the people [for to minister to them,]"
