**ΨΑΛΜ. ΡΜΖ΄.—ΡΜΗ΄. ΨΑΛΤΗΡΙΟΝ. 1049**
Ὅτι ἀγαθὸν ψαλμός· τῷ Θεῷ ἡμῶν ἡδυνθείη αἴνεσις. Οἰκοδομῶν 2
Ἱερουσαλὴμ ὁ Κύριος· (καὶ) τὰς διασπορὰς τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ ἐπισυνάξει.
Ὁ ἰώμενος τοὺς συντετριμμένους τὴν καρδίαν, καὶ δεσμεύων τὰ 3
συντρίμματα αὐτῶν. Ὁ ἀριθμῶν πλῆθος ἄστρων, καὶ πᾶσιν αὐ- 4
τοῖς ὀνόματα καλῶν. Μέγας ὁ Κύριος ἡμῶν, καὶ μεγάλη ἡ ἰσχὺς 5
αὐτοῦ· καὶ τῆς συνέσεως αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἔστιν ἀριθμός. Ἀναλαμβά- 6
νων πραεῖς ὁ Κύριος· ταπεινῶν δὲ ἁμαρτωλοὺς ἕως τῆς γῆς.
Ἐξάρξατε τῷ Κυρίῳ ἐν ἐξομολογήσει, ψάλατε τῷ Θεῷ ἡμῶν ἐν 7
κιθάρᾳ· τῷ περιβάλλοντι τὸν οὐρανὸν ἐν νεφέλαις, τῷ ἑτοιμάζον- 8
τι, τῇ γῇ ὑετόν· τῷ ἐξανατέλλοντι ἐν ὄρεσι χόρτον, (καὶ) διδόντι 9
τοῖς κτήνεσι τροφὴν αὐτῶν, καὶ τοῖς νεοσσοῖς τῶν κοράκων τοῖς
ἐπικαλουμένοις αὐτόν. Οὐκ ἐν τῇ δυναστείᾳ τοῦ ἵππου θελήσει, 10
οὐδὲ ἐν ταῖς κνήμαις τοῦ ἀνδρὸς εὐδοκεῖ· εὐδοκεῖ Κύριος ἐν τοῖς φο- 11
βουμένοις αὐτόν, καὶ ἐν (πᾶσι) τοῖς ἐλπίζουσιν ἐπὶ τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ΡΜΖ΄. CXLVII.**

ΑΛΛΗΛΟΥΪΑ Ἀγγαίου καὶ Ζαχαρίου. Ἐπαίνει Ἱερουσα- 1
λὴμ τὸν Κύριον, αἴνει τὸν Θεόν σου Σιών· ἔτι ἐνίσχυσε τοὺς μο- 2
χλοὺς τῶν πυλῶν σου, εὐλόγησε τοὺς υἱούς σου ἐν σοί. Ὁ τιθεὶς 3
τὰ ὅριά σου εἰρήνην, καὶ στέαρ πυροῦ ἐμπιπλῶν σε. Ὁ ἀποστέλλων 4
τὸ λόγιον αὐτοῦ τῇ γῇ, ἕως τάχους δραμεῖται ὁ λόγος αὐτοῦ·
τοῦ διδόντος χιόνα ὡσεὶ ἔριον, ὁμίχλην ὡσεὶ σποδὸν πάσσοντος· 5
βάλλοντος κρύσταλλον αὐτοῦ ὡσεὶ ψωμούς· κατὰ πρόσωπον ψύχους 6
αὐτοῦ τίς ὑποστήσεται; Ἀποστελεῖ τὸν λόγον αὐτοῦ, καὶ τήξει 7
αὐτά· πνεύσει τὸ πνεῦμα αὐτοῦ, καὶ ῥυήσεται ὕδατα. Ἀπαγγέ- 8
λων τὸν λόγον αὐτοῦ τῷ Ἰακώβ, δικαιώματα καὶ κρίματα αὐτοῦ
τῷ Ἰσραήλ· οὐκ ἐποίησεν οὕτως παντὶ ἔθνει, καὶ τὰ κρίματα αὐ- 9
τοῦ οὐκ ἐδήλωσεν αὐτοῖς. Ἀλληλούϊα.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ΡΜΗ΄. CXLVIII.**

ΑΛΛΗΛΟΥΪΑ (Ἀγγαίου καὶ Ζαχαρίου). Αἰνεῖτε τὸν Κύριον 1
ἐκ τῶν οὐρανῶν· αἰνεῖτε αὐτὸν ἐν τοῖς ὑψίστοις. Αἰνεῖτε αὐτὸν 2
πάντες οἱ ἄγγελοι αὐτοῦ· αἰνεῖτε αὐτὸν πᾶσαι αἱ δυνάμεις αὐτοῦ.
Αἰνεῖτε αὐτὸν ἥλιος καὶ σελήνη· αἰνεῖτε αὐτὸν πάντα τὰ ἄστρα καὶ 3
τὸ φῶς. Αἰνεῖτε αὐτὸν οἱ οὐρανοὶ τῶν οὐρανῶν καὶ τὸ ὕδωρ τὸ 4
ὑπεράνω τῶν οὐρανῶν. Αἰνεσάτωσαν τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου ὅτι αὐτὸς 5
εἶπε, καὶ ἐγενήθησαν· αὐτὸς ἐνετείλατο, καὶ ἐκτίσθησαν. Ἔστησεν 6
αὐτὰ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, καὶ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τοῦ αἰῶνος· πρόσταγμα
ἔθετο, καὶ οὐ παρελεύσεται. Αἰνεῖτε τὸν Κύριον ἐκ τῆς γῆς· δρά- 8
κοντες καὶ πᾶσαι ἄβυσσοι· πῦρ, χάλαζα, χιών, κρύσταλλος, πνεῦ- 9
μα καταιγίδος, τὰ ποιοῦντα τὸν λόγον αὐτοῦ· τὰ ὄρη καὶ πάντες 10
οἱ βουνοί, ξύλα καρποφόρα καὶ πᾶσαι κέδροι· τὰ θηρία καὶ πάντα 11
τὰ κτήνη, ἑρπετὰ καὶ πετεινὰ πτερωτά· βασιλεῖς τῆς γῆς καὶ πάν- 12
τες λαοί, ἄρχοντες καὶ πάντες κριταὶ γῆς· νεανίσκοι καὶ παρ- 13
θένοι, πρεσβῦται μετὰ νεωτέρων. Αἰνεσάτωσαν τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου· 14
ὅτι ὑψώθη τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ μόνου, ἡ ἐξομολόγησις αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ γῆς
καὶ οὐρανοῦ. Καὶ ὑψώσει κέρας λαοῦ αὐτοῦ· ὕμνος πᾶσι τοῖς
ὁσίοις αὐτοῦ, τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ, λαῷ ἐγγίζοντι αὐτῷ. Ἀλληλούϊα.

**PSALM 146 (LXX 146) [continued].**

**1** For a psalm is good;
    let praise be sweet unto our God.
**2** The Lord doth build up Jerusalem;
    and He shall gather together the dispersed of Israel.
**3** He healeth the broken in heart,
    and bindeth up their wounds.
**4** He numbereth the multitude of the stars,
    and calleth them all by [their] names.
**5** Great is our Lord, and great is His power;
    and of His understanding there is no number.
**6** The Lord lifteth up the meek;
    but He humbleth the wicked even to the earth.
**7** Begin ye [your song] to the Lord with confession [of praise],
    sing praises to our God with the lyre.
**8** Who covereth the heaven with clouds,
    Who prepareth rain for the earth;
**9** Who causeth grass to spring forth upon the mountains,
    and giveth food to the cattle,
    and to the raven's young ones that call upon Him.
**10** He delighteth not in the might of the horse,
    nor taketh pleasure in the legs of a man.
**11** The Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear Him,
    and in [all] them that hope in His mercy.

**PSALM 147 (LXX 147).**

*Alleluia. Of Haggai and Zechariah.*
**1** Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem;
    praise thy God, O Zion.
**2** For He hath strengthened the bars of thy gates;
    He hath blessed thy sons within thee.
**3** Who maketh peace thy borders,
    and filleth thee with the fat of wheat.
**4** Who sendeth forth His word to the earth,
    [and] His word shall run swiftly.
**5** Who giveth snow like wool,
    Who scattereth the mist like ashes;
**6** Who casteth forth His ice like crumbs;
    before the face of His cold, who shall stand?
**7** He shall send forth His word, and melt them;
    He shall blow with His Spirit, and the waters shall flow.
**8** He declareth His word unto Jacob,
    His judgments and His ordinances unto Israel.
**9** He hath not dealt so with every nation;
    and His judgments hath He not made manifest unto them.
    Alleluia.

**PSALM 148 (LXX 148).**

*Alleluia. (Of Haggai and Zechariah.)*
**1** Praise the Lord from the heavens;
    praise Him in the highest [places].
**2** Praise Him, all ye His angels;
    praise Him, all ye His hosts.
**3** Praise Him, sun and moon;
    praise Him, all ye stars and light.
**4** Praise Him, ye heavens of heavens,
    and ye waters that are above the heavens.
**5** Let them praise the Name of the Lord;
    for He spake, and they were made;
    He commanded, and they were created.
**6** He hath established them for ever,
    and for ever and ever;
    He hath given them a decree,
    and it shall not pass away.
**7** Praise the Lord from the earth,
    ye dragons and all ye deeps;
**8** Fire, hail, snow, ice,
    stormy wind, fulfilling His word;
**9** Mountains and all hills,
    fruitful trees and all cedars;
**10** Wild beasts and all cattle,
    creeping things and winged fowl;
**11** Kings of the earth and all peoples,
    princes and all judges of the earth;
**12** Young men and maidens,
    old men with young.
**13** Let them praise the Name of the Lord;
    for His Name alone is exalted;
    His confession [of praise] is upon earth and heaven.
**14** And He shall exalt the horn of His people,
    a hymn to all His saints,
    to the sons of Israel, a people drawing nigh unto Him.
    Alleluia.
