**Ω Σ Η Ε. ΚΕΦ. ΙΒ΄. ΙΓ΄.**

**11** προφητῶν ὡμοιώθην. Εἰ μὴ Γαλαὰδ ἐστίν, ἄρα ψευδεῖς ἦσαν ἐν
**12** Γαλγάλοις ἄρχοντες θυσιάζοντες, καὶ τὰ θυσιαστήρια αὐτῶν ὡς
    χελῶναι ἐπὶ χέρσον ἀγροῦ. Καὶ ἀνεχώρησεν Ἰακὼβ εἰς πεδίον
    Συρίας, καὶ ἐδούλευσεν Ἰσραὴλ ἐν γυναικί, καὶ ἐν γυναικὶ ἐφυλάξατο.
**13** Καὶ ἐν προφήτῃ ἀνήγαγε Κύριος τὸν Ἰσραὴλ ἐξ Αἰγύπτου,
    καὶ ἐν προφήτῃ διεφυλάχθη.
**14** Ἐθύμωσεν ἐν Ἐφραὶμ καὶ
    παρώργισε· καὶ τὸ αἷμα αὐτοῦ ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸν ἐκχυθήσεται, καὶ τὸν
    ὀνειδισμὸν αὐτοῦ ἀνταποδώσει αὐτῷ Κύριος.

**ΚΕΦ. ΙΓ΄.**

**1** ΚΑΤΑ τὸν λόγον Ἐφραὶμ δικαιώματα αὐτὸς ἔλαβεν ἐν τῷ
    Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἔθετο αὐτὰ τῇ Βάαλ καὶ ἀπέθανε.
**2** Καὶ νῦν προσέθεντο τοῦ ἁμαρτάνειν ἔτι, καὶ ἐποίησαν ἑαυτοῖς χώνευμα ἐκ τοῦ
    ἀργυρίου ἑαυτῶν κατ᾽ εἰκόνα εἰδώλων, ἔργα τεκτόνων συνετελεσμένα αὐτοῖς· αὐτοὶ λέγουσι· θύσατε ἀνθρώπους, μόσχοι γὰρ ἐκλελοίπασι.
**3** Διὰ τοῦτο ἔσονται ὡς νεφέλη πρωϊνή, καὶ ὡς δρόσος
    ὀρθρινὴ πορευομένη, ὥσπερ χνοῦς ἀποφυσώμενος ἀφ᾽ ἅλωνος, καὶ
**4** ὡς ἀτμὶς ἀπὸ ἀκρίδων. Ἐγὼ δὲ Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου, ὁ στερεῶν
    οὐρανὸν καὶ κτίζων γῆν, οὗ αἱ χεῖρες ἔκτισαν πᾶσαν τὴν στρατιὰν τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ οὐ παρέδειξά σοι αὐτὰ τοῦ πορεύεσθαι ὀπίσω αὐτῶν· καὶ ἐγὼ ἀνήγαγόν σε ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, καὶ Θεὸν πλὴν
**5** ἐμοῦ οὐ γνώσῃ, καὶ σώζων οὐκ ἔστι πάρεξ ἐμοῦ. Ἐγὼ ἐποίμαινόν σε ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, ἐν γῇ ἀοικήτῳ κατὰ τὰς νομάς αὐτῶν·
**6** καὶ ἐνεπλήσθησαν εἰς πλησμονήν, καὶ ὑψώθησαν αἱ καρδίαι αὐτῶν, ἕνεκα τούτου ἐπελάθοντό μου.
**7** Καὶ ἔσομαι αὐτοῖς ὡς πανθὴρ,
**8** καὶ ὡς πάρδαλις κατὰ τὴν ὁδὸν Ἀσσυρίων· ἀπαντήσομαι
    αὐτοῖς ὡς ἄρκτος ἀπορουμένη, καὶ διαρρήξω συγκλεισμὸν καρδίας
    αὐτῶν· καὶ φάγονται αὐτοὺς ἐκεῖ σκύμνοι δρυμοῦ, θηρία ἀγροῦ
    διασπάσει αὐτούς.
**9** Τῇ διαφθορᾷ σου Ἰσραὴλ τίς βοηθήσει;
**10** ποῦ ὁ βασιλεύς σου οὗτος; καὶ διασωσάτω σε ἐν πάσαις ταῖς πόλεσι
**11** σου· κρινάτω σε ὃν εἶπας, δὸς μοι βασιλέα καὶ ἄρχοντα· Καὶ
    ἔδωκά σοι βασιλέα ἐν ὀργῇ μου, καὶ ἔσχον ἐν τῷ θυμῷ μου.
**12** Συστροφὴν ἀδικίας Ἐφραίμ, ἐγκεκρυμμένη ἁμαρτία αὐτοῦ·
**13** ὠδῖνες ἥξουσιν αὐτῷ ὡς τικτούσης. Οὗτος ὁ υἱὸς οὐχ ὁ φρόνιμος, διότι
    οὐ μὴ ὑποστῇ ἐν συντριβῇ τέκνων.
**14** Ἐκ χειρὸς ᾅδου ῥύσομαι αὐτούς, ἐκ θανάτου λυτρώσομαι αὐτοῦ· ποῦ ἡ δίκη σου, θάνατε;
    ποῦ τὸ κέντρον σου, ᾅδη; Παράκλησις κέκρυπται ἀπὸ ὀφθαλμῶν
    μου· διότι οὗτος ἀνάμεσον ἀδελφῶν διαστελεῖ.

**CHAPTER 12**

**11** And I was likened unto the prophets. If Gilead be [a place of iniquity], then surely false were the rulers in Gilgal who sacrificed, and their altars were as tortoises upon the dry land of the field.
**12** And Jacob departed into the plain of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he did keep [his flock].
**13** And by a prophet the Lord brought up Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet he was guarded.
**14** Ephraim hath provoked [Me] to wrath and greatly angered [Me]; and his blood shall be poured out upon him, and the Lord shall repay unto him his reproach.

**CHAPTER 13**

**1** According to the word of Ephraim, he himself did obtain ordinances in Israel; and he gave them unto Baal, and he died.
**2** And now they have added yet to sin, and have made unto themselves a molten image of their silver, according to the likeness of idols, works of craftsmen, fully fashioned for them. They themselves say, 'Sacrifice ye men!' for calves have failed.
**3** Therefore shall they be as a morning cloud, and as the early dew that passeth away, as the chaff blown away from the threshing-floor, and as the vapor from locusts.
**4** But I am the Lord thy God, Who establisheth the heaven and createth the earth, Whose hands have formed all the host of heaven, and I showed them not unto thee, that thou shouldest walk after them. And I brought thee up from the land of Egypt, and thou shalt know no God save Me, and there is no saviour beside Me.
**5** I did feed thee in the wilderness, in a land uninhabited, according to their pastures;
**6** and they were filled unto satiety, and their hearts were lifted up; for this cause they forgot Me.
**7** And I shall be unto them as a panther,
**8** and as a leopard by the way of the Assyrians; I shall meet them as a bear bereaved, and I shall tear open the enclosure of their heart; and there shall cubs of the forest devour them, [and] wild beasts of the field shall tear them apart.
**9** O Israel, who shall help thee in thy destruction?
**10** Where is this thy King, that he may save thee in all thy cities? Let him judge thee, whom thou saidst, 'Give me a king and a ruler!'
**11** And I gave thee a king in My wrath, and I took him away in My fury.
**12** A binding together of iniquity is Ephraim's; his sin is hidden away.
**13** Pangs shall come upon him as upon one giving birth. This son is not the wise one, for he shall not stand fast in the breaking forth of children.
**14** From the hand of Hades will I ransom them; from death will I redeem him. O Death, where is thy judgment? O Hades, where is thy sting? Consolation is hidden from Mine eyes; because he shall separate among brethren.
