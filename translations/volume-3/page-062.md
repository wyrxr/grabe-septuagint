**ΨΑΛΜ. ΟΘʹ. LXXIX.**

20 καὶ τὸ ὄνομά σου ἐπικαλεσόμεθα. Κύριε ὁ Θεὸς τῶν δυνάμεων
ἐπίστρεψον ἡμᾶς, καὶ ἐπίφανον τὸ πρόσωπόν σου, καὶ σωθησόμεθα.

**ΨΑΛΜ. Πʹ. LXXX.**

1.2 Εἰς τὸ τέλος, ὑπὲρ τῶν ληνῶν (ψαλμὸς) τῷ Ἀσάφ. Ἀγαλλιᾶσθε τῷ Θεῷ τῷ βοηθῷ ἡμῶν, ἀλαλάξατε τῷ Θεῷ Ἰακώβ·
3 λάβετε ψαλμὸν καὶ δότε τύμπανον, ψαλτήριον τερπνὸν μετὰ κιθάρας·
4 σαλπίσατε ἐν νεομηνίᾳ σάλπιγγι, ἐν εὐσήμῳ ἡμέρᾳ ἑορτῆς
5 ἡμῶν. Ὅτι πρόσταγμα τῷ Ἰσραήλ ἐστι, καὶ κρίμα τῷ Θεῷ Ἰακώβ·
6 μαρτύριον ἐν τῷ Ἰωσὴφ ἔθετο αὐτὸ, ἐν τῷ ἐξελθεῖν αὐτὸν
7 ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου· γλῶσσαν ἣν οὐκ ἔγνω ἤκουσεν. Ἀπέστησεν ἀπὸ ἄρσεως τὸν νῶτον αὐτοῦ· αἱ χεῖρες αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ κοφίνῳ ἐδούλευσαν.
8 Ἐν θλίψει ἐπεκαλέσω με, καὶ ἐῤῥυσάμην σε· ἐπήκουσά σου, ἐν ἀποκρύφῳ καταιγίδος· ἐδοκίμασά σε ἐπὶ ὕδατος ἀντιλογίας. Διάψαλμα.
9 Ἄκουσον λαός μου καὶ διαμαρτυροῦμαί σοι Ἰσραήλ, ἐὰν
10 ἀκούσῃς μου· οὐκ ἔσται ἐν σοὶ Θεὸς πρόσφατος, οὐδὲ προσκυνήσεις Θεῷ ἀλλοτρίῳ.
11 Ἐγὼ γάρ εἰμι Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου, ὁ ἀναγαγών σε ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου· πλάτυνον τὸ στόμα σου, καὶ πληρώσω αὐτό.
12 Καὶ οὐκ ἤκουσεν ὁ λαός μου τῆς φωνῆς μου, καὶ Ἰσραὴλ
13 οὐ προσέσχε μοι· καὶ ἐξαπέστειλα αὐτοὺς κατὰ τὰ ἐπιτηδεύματα τῶν καρδιῶν αὐτῶν, πορεύσονται ἐν τοῖς ἐπιτηδεύμασιν αὐτῶν.
14 Εἰ ὁ λαός μου ἤκουσέ μου, Ἰσραὴλ ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς μου εἰ ἐπορεύθη,
15 ἐν τῷ μηδενὶ ἂν τοὺς ἐχθροὺς αὐτῶν ἐταπείνωσα, καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς
16 θλίβοντας αὐτοὺς ἐπέβαλον ἂν τὴν χεῖρά μου· οἱ ἐχθροὶ Κυρίου ἐψεύσαντο αὐτῷ, καὶ ἔσται ὁ καιρὸς αὐτῶν εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα·
17 καὶ ἐψώμισεν αὐτοὺς ἐκ στέατος πυροῦ, καὶ ἐκ πέτρας μέλι ἐχόρτασεν αὐτούς.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ΠΑʹ. LXXXI.**

1 Ψαλμὸς τῷ Ἀσάφ. Ὁ Θεὸς ἔστη ἐν συναγωγῇ θεῶν· ἐν
2 μέσῳ δὲ θεοὺς διακρινεῖ. Ἕως πότε κρίνετε ἀδικίαν, καὶ πρόσωπα ἁμαρτωλῶν λαμβάνετε ; Διάψαλμα.
3 Κρίνετε ὀρφανῷ καὶ πτωχῷ, ταπεινὸν καὶ πένητα δικαιώσατε·
4 ἐξέλεσθε πένητα καὶ πτωχὸν, ἐκ χειρὸς ἁμαρτωλοῦ ῥύσασθε (αὐτούς).
5 Οὐκ ἔγνωσαν οὐδὲ

**PSALM LXXIX.**

20 ...and Thy Name shall we call upon.
O Lord, God of Hosts, turn us back,
And make Thy face to shine [upon us], and we shall be saved.

**PSALM LXXX.**

1 Unto the End, for the winepresses, a Psalm for Asaph.
2 Exult ye in God our Helper;
Shout aloud to the God of Jacob!
3 Take up a psalm and bring a timbrel,
A pleasant psaltery with the harp.
4 Blow the trumpet in the new moon,
In the appointed day of our feast.
5 For it is a precept for Israel,
And a judgment for the God of Jacob.
6 He made it a testimony in Joseph,
When he went forth from the land of Egypt.
7 He heard a tongue which he knew not.
He removed his back from burdens;
His hands labored in the basket.
8 In tribulation didst thou call upon Me, and I delivered thee.
I heard thee in the secret place of the storm;
I proved thee at the waters of contradiction. *Pause*.
9 Hear, O My people, and I will testify to thee, O Israel,
If thou wilt hearken unto Me.
10 There shall be in thee no strange god,
Neither shalt thou worship a foreign god.
11 For I am the Lord thy God,
Who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt;
Open wide thy mouth, and I will fill it.
12 But My people did not hearken unto My voice,
And Israel paid no heed to Me.
13 So I sent them forth according to the desires of their hearts;
They shall walk in their own devices.
14 If My people had hearkened unto Me,
If Israel had walked in My ways,
15 In a moment would I have humbled their enemies,
And upon those who afflict them would I have laid My hand.
16 The enemies of the Lord have dealt falsely with Him,
And their season shall be for ever.
17 He would have fed them with the fat of wheat,
And with honey from the rock He would have satisfied them.

**PSALM LXXXI.**

1 A Psalm for Asaph.
God stood in the assembly of gods;
In the midst, He will judge among the gods.
2 How long will ye judge unjustly,
And accept the persons of the wicked? *Pause*.
3 Judge for the orphan and the poor;
Justify the humble and the needy.
4 Deliver the poor and the needy;
Rescue [them] from the hand of the sinner.
5 They knew not, neither did they understand;
