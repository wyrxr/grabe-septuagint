ΚΕΦ. Γ΄.
4 τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ λαλήσῃς τοὺς λόγους μου πρὸς αὐτούς,
5 διότι οὐ πρὸς λαὸν βαθύχειλον καὶ βαρύγλωσσον σὺ ἐξαποστέλλῃ,
    πρὸς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Ἰσραήλ· οὐδὲ πρὸς λαοὺς πολλοὺς ἀλλογλώσσους
6 ἢ ἀλλοφώνους, οὐδὲ στιβαροὺς τῇ γλώσσῃ ὄντας, ὧν οὐκ ἀκούσῃ
    τοὺς λόγους αὐτῶν, καὶ εἰ πρὸς τοιούτους ἐξαπέστειλά σε, οὗτοι
    ἂν εἰσήκουσαν σου.
7 Ὁ δὲ οἶκος τοῦ Ἰσραήλ οὐ μὴ θελήσουσιν εἰσακοῦσαί σου, διότι
    οὐ βούλονται εἰσακούειν μου, ὅτι πᾶς ὁ οἶκος τοῦ Ἰσραήλ φιλονεικοί
    εἰσι καὶ σκληρόκαρδιοι.
8 Καὶ ἰδοὺ δέδωκα τὸ προσωπὸν σου δυνατὸν κατέναντι τῶν
    προσώπων αὐτῶν, καὶ τὸ νεῖκός σου κατισχύσω κατέναντι τοῦ
    νείκους αὐτῶν,
9 καὶ ἔσται, διαπαντὸς κραταιότερον πέτρας δέδωκα τὸ νεῖκός
    σου, μὴ φοβηθῇς ἀπ᾽ αὐτῶν, μηδὲ πτοηθῇς ἀπὸ προσώπου
    αὐτῶν, διότι οἶκος παραπικραίνων ἐστί.
10 Καὶ εἶπε πρός μέ· υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, πάντας τοὺς λόγους, οὓς λελάληκα
    μετά σοῦ, λάβε εἰς τὴν καρδίαν σου, καὶ τοῖς ὠσί σου ἄκουε,
11 καὶ βάδιζε, εἴσελθε εἰς τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν πρὸς τοὺς υἱοὺς τοῦ
    λαοῦ σου, καὶ λαλήσεις πρὸς αὐτούς, καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτούς·
    τάδε λέγει Κύριος Κύριος· ἐὰν ἄρα ἀκούσωσιν, ἐὰν ἄρα ἐνδῶσι.
12 Καὶ ἀνέλαβέ με πνεῦμα, καὶ ἤκουσα κατόπισθέν μου φωνὴν
    σεισμοῦ μεγάλου, λεγόντων· εὐλογημένη ἡ δόξα Κυρίου ἐκ τοῦ
    τόπου αὐτοῦ.
13 Καὶ εἶδον φωνὴν πτερύγων τῶν ζώων πτερυσομένων ἑτέρα
    πρὸς τὴν ἑτέραν, καὶ φωνὴ τῶν τροχῶν ἐχομένων αὐτῶν, καὶ
    φωνὴ τοῦ σεισμοῦ.
14 Καὶ τὸ πνεῦμα Κυρίου ἐξῆρέ με, καὶ ἀνέλαβέ με, καὶ ἐπορεύθην
    μετέωρος ἐν ὁρμῇ τοῦ πνεύματός μου, καὶ χεὶρ Κυρίου ἐγένετο
    ἐπ᾽ ἐμὲ κραταιά.
15 Καὶ εἰσῆλθον εἰς τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν μετέωρος, καὶ περιῆλθον
    τοὺς κατοικοῦντας ἐπὶ τοῦ ποταμοῦ τοῦ Χοβὰρ τοὺς ὄντας ἐκεῖ·
    καὶ ἐκάθισα ἐκεῖ ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας, ἀναστρεφόμενος ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῶν.
16 Καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ τὰς ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς μέ,
    λέγων· Υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, σκοπὸν δέδωκά σε τῷ οἴκῳ Ἰσραήλ,
17 καὶ ἀκούσῃ ἐκ στόματός μου λόγον, καὶ διαπειλήσῃ αὐτοῖς παρ᾽
    ἐμοῦ, ἐν τῷ λέγειν με τῷ ἀνόμῳ, θανάτῳ θανατωθήσῃ·
18 καὶ σὺ διεστέιλω αὐτῷ, οὐδὲ ἐλάλησας τοῦ διαστείλσθαι τῷ
    ἀνόμῳ, ἀποστρέψαι ἀπὸ τῶν ὁδῶν αὐτοῦ τοῦ ζῆσαι αὐτόν· ὁ
    ἄνομος ἐκεῖνος τῇ ἀδικίᾳ αὐτοῦ ἀποθανεῖται, καὶ τὸ αἷμα αὐτοῦ
    ἐκ χειρός σου ἐκζητήσω.
19 Καὶ σὺ ἐὰν διαστείλῃ τῷ ἀνόμῳ, καὶ μὴ ἀποστρέψῃ ἀπὸ τῆς
    ἀνομίας αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς ὁδοῦ
20 αὐτοῦ, ὁ ἄνομος ἐκεῖνος ἐν τῇ ἀδικίᾳ αὐτοῦ ἀποθανεῖται, καὶ
    σὺ τὴν ψυχήν σου ἐρύσω. Καὶ ἐν τῷ ἀποστρέφειν δίκαιον ἀπὸ τῆς
    δικαιοσύνης αὐτοῦ, καὶ ποιήσῃ παράπτωμα, καὶ δώσω τὴν
    βάσανον εἰς πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ, αὐτὸς ἀποθανεῖται, ὅτι οὐ
    διεστέιλω αὐτῷ· καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις αὐτοῦ ἀποθανεῖται, διότι
    οὐ μὴ μνησθῶσιν αἱ δικαιοσύναι αὐτοῦ ἃς ἐποίησε, καὶ τὸ αἷμα
    αὐτοῦ ἐκ τῆς χειρός σου ἐκζητήσω.
21 Σὺ δὲ ἐὰν διαστείλῃ τῷ δικαίῳ τοῦ μὴ ἁμαρτάνειν, καὶ αὐτὸς
    μὴ ἁμάρτῃ, ὁ δίκαιος ζωῇ ζήσεται, ὅτι διεστέιλω αὐτῷ, καὶ σὺ
    τὴν ψυχήν σου ρύσῃ.
22 Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐπ᾿ ἐμὲ χεὶρ Κυρίου, καὶ εἶπε πρός μέ· ἀνάστηθι,
    καὶ ἐξελθε εἰς τὸ πεδίον, καὶ ἐκεῖ λαληθήσεται πρός σέ.
23 Καὶ ἀνέστην καὶ ἐξῆλθον εἰς τὸ πεδίον· καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐκεῖ δόξα
    Κυρίου εἰστήκει, καθὼς ἡ δρασις καὶ καθὼς ἡ δόξα, ἣν ἴδον ἐπὶ
    τοῦ ποταμοῦ τοῦ Χοβάρ·
24 καὶ πίπτω ἐπὶ πρόσωπόν μου, καὶ ἦλθεν ἐπ᾿ ἐμὲ πνεῦμα, καὶ
    ἔστησέ με ἐπὶ πόδας μου, καὶ ἐλάλησε πρός μέ, καὶ εἶπέ μοι·
    εἴσελθε, καὶ
25 ἐγκλείσθητι ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ οἴκου σου. Καὶ σὺ υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου,
    ἰδοὺ δέδονται ἐπὶ σὲ δεσμοί, καὶ δήσουσί σε ἐν αὐτοῖς, καὶ σὺ
    οὐ μὴ ἐξέλθῃς ἐκ μέσου αὐτῶν.
26 Καὶ τὴν γλῶσσάν σου συνδήσω πρὸς τὸν φάρυγγά σου, καὶ
    ἀποκωφωθήσῃ, καὶ οὐκ ἔσῃ αὐτοῖς εἰς ἄνδρα ἐλέγχοντα, διότι
    οἶκος παραπικραίνων ἐστί.
27 Καὶ ἐν τῷ λαλεῖν με πρός σέ, ἀνοίξω τὸ στόμα σου, καὶ ἐρεῖς
    πρὸς αὐτούς· τάδε λέγει Κύριος Κύριος· ὁ ἀκούων ἀκουέτω,
    καὶ ὁ ἀπειθῶν ἀπειθείτω, διότι οἶκος παραπικραίνων ἐστί.

### Chapter 3

**4** the house of Israel; and thou shalt speak My words unto them,
**5** for not unto a people of deep lip and heavy tongue art thou sent,
    [even] unto the house of Israel; nor unto many peoples of strange
**6** tongues or strange speech, nor [unto those] who are stubborn in their
    speech, whose words thou wouldst not hear; and if I had sent thee
    unto such, these would have hearkened unto thee.
**7** But the house of Israel will not be willing to hearken unto thee,
    for they are not willing to hearken unto Me; because all the house
    of Israel are contentious and hard-hearted.
**8** And behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and
    thy contention I shall make mighty against their contention,
**9** and I have given thy contention mightier than a rock, [to endure] always.
    Fear them not, neither be affrighted by their countenances,
    because it is a house that embittereth [Me].
**10** And He said unto me, “Son of man, all the words which I have
    spoken with thee, take them into thy heart, and with thine ears hear,
**11** and go, enter into the captivity unto the sons of thy people, and
    thou shalt speak unto them, and thou shalt say unto them,
    ‘Thus saith the Lord God: if perhaps they hear, if perhaps they yield.’”
**12** And the Spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of
    a great shaking, of those saying, “Blessed be the glory of the
    Lord from His place.”
**13** And I heard the voice of the wings of the living creatures flapping,
    one toward the other, and the voice of the wheels that were beside them,
    and the voice of the shaking.
**14** And the Spirit of the Lord lifted me up, and took me, and I went,
    borne aloft in the rush of my spirit; and the hand of the Lord
    became mighty upon me.
**15** And I came into the captivity, borne aloft, and I went among
    those who dwelt by the river Chebar, those who were there;
    and I sat there seven days, sojourning in their midst.
**16** And it came to pass after the seven days, that the word of the
    Lord came unto me, saying, “Son of man, I have made thee
    a watchman unto the house of Israel,
**17** and thou shalt hear a word from My mouth, and thou shalt
    earnestly threaten them from Me, when I say unto the lawless one,
    ‘Thou shalt surely die the death!’
**18** And thou didst warn him, nor didst thou speak to warn the
    lawless one, to turn from his ways, that he might live;
    that lawless one shall die in his iniquity, and his blood
    I shall require at thy hand.
**19** But if thou warn the lawless one, and he turn not from his
    iniquity, nor from his way,
**20** that lawless one shall die in his iniquity, and thou shalt deliver
    thy soul. And when a righteous man turneth from his
    righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and I give a stumbling-block
    before his face, he himself shall die, because thou didst not
    warn him; and in his sins shall he die, because his righteous deeds
    which he did shall not be remembered, and his blood
    I shall require at thy hand.
**21** But if thou warn the righteous one not to sin, and he doth not
    sin, that righteous one shall surely live, because thou didst warn him,
    and thou shalt deliver thy soul.
**22** And the hand of the Lord came upon me, and He said unto me,
    “Arise, and go forth into the plain, and there shall it be spoken unto thee.”
**23** And I arose and went forth into the plain; and behold, the glory
    of the Lord stood there, as the vision and as the glory which
    I had seen by the river Chebar;
**24** and I fell upon my face; and the Spirit came upon me, and set me
    upon my feet, and spoke unto me, and said unto me, “Enter, and
**25** be shut up in the midst of thy house. And thou, Son of man,
    behold, bonds have been laid upon thee, and they shall bind thee
    with them, and thou shalt in no wise go forth from their midst.
**26** And I shall bind thy tongue to thy throat, and thou shalt be
    made mute, and thou shalt not be unto them a man rebuking,
    because it is a house that embittereth [Me].
**27** But when I speak unto thee, I shall open thy mouth, and thou
    shalt say unto them, ‘Thus saith the Lord God: he that heareth,
    let him hear; and he that is disobedient, let him be disobedient’;
    for it is a house that embittereth [Me].”
