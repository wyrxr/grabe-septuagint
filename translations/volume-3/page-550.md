ΙΩΗΛ. ΚΕΦ. Α΄. Β΄.
16 Κυρίου, καὶ ὡς ταλαιπωρία ἐκ ταλαιπωρίας ἥξει· ὅτι κατέναντι
     τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν ἡμῶν βρώματα ἐξωλεθρεύθη, ἐξ οἴκου Θεοῦ ὑμῶν
17 εὐφροσύνη καὶ χαρά. Ἐσκίρτησαν δαμάλεις ἐπὶ ταῖς φάτναις αὐ-
     τῶν, ἠφανίσθησαν θησαυροί, κατεσκάφησαν ληνοί, ὅτι ἐξηράνθη
18 σῖτος. Τί ἀποθήσομεν ἑαυτοῖς; ἔκλαυσαν βουκόλια βοῶν, ὅτι
     οὐχ ὑπῆρχε νομὴ αὐτοῖς, καὶ τὰ ποίμνια τῶν προβάτων ἠφανί-
19 σθη. Πρὸς σὲ Κύριε βοήσομαι, ὅτι πῦρ ἀνήλωσε τὰ ὡραῖα τῆς
20 ἐρήμου, καὶ φλὸξ ἀνῆψε πάντα τὰ ξύλα τοῦ ἀγροῦ· καὶ τὰ κτή-
     νη τοῦ πεδίου ἀνέβλεψε πρὸς σὲ, ὅτι ἐξηράνθησαν ἀφέσεις ὑδά-
     των, καὶ πῦρ κατέφαγε τὰ ὡραῖα τῆς ἐρήμου.

ΚΕΦ. Β΄. ΙΙ.

1 Σαλπίσατε σάλπιγγι ἐν Σιὼν, κηρύξατε ἐν ὄρει ἁγίῳ μου,
     καὶ συγχυθήτωσαν πάντες οἱ κατοικοῦντες τὴν γῆν· διότι πάρ-
2 ἐστιν ἡ ἡμέρα τοῦ Κυρίου, ὅτι ἐγγὺς (ἡ ἡμέρα τοῦ Κυρίου.) ἡμέ-
     ρα σκότους καὶ γνόφου, ἡμέρα νεφέλης καὶ ὁμίχλης. Ὡς ὄρθρος
     χυθήσεται ἐπὶ τὰ ὄρη λαὸς πολὺς καὶ ἰσχυρός· ὅμοιος αὐτοῦ οὐ
     γέγονεν ἀπὸ τοῦ αἰῶνος, καὶ μετ᾽ αὐτὸν οὐ προστεθήσεται ἕως
3 ἐτῶν εἰς γενεὰς γενεῶν. Τὰ ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ πῦρ ἀναλίσκον, καὶ
     τὰ ὄπισθεν αὐτοῦ ἀναπτομένη φλὲξ· ὡς παράδεισος τρυφῆς ἡ γῆ
     πρὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰ ὄπισθεν αὐτοῦ πεδίον ἀφανισμοῦ,
4 καὶ ἀνασωζόμενος οὐκ ἔσται αὐτῷ. Ὡς ὅρασις ἵππων ἡ ὅρασις
5 αὐτῶν, καὶ ὡς ἱππεῖς οὕτως καταδιώξονται· ὡς φωνὴ ἁρμάτων
     ἐπὶ τὰς κορυφὰς τῶν ὀρέων ἐξαλοῦνται, καὶ ὡς φωνὴ φλογὸς πυ-
     ρὸς κατεσθιούσης καλάμην, καὶ ὡς λαὸς πολὺς καὶ ἰσχυρὸς πα-
6 ρατασσόμενος εἰς πόλεμον. Ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ συντριβήσον-
7 ται λαοί· πᾶν πρόσωπον ὡς πρόσκαυμα χύτρας. Ὡς μαχηταὶ δρα-
     μοῦνται, καὶ ὡς ἄνδρες πολεμισταὶ ἀναβήσονται ἐπὶ τὰ τείχη· καὶ
     ἕκαστος ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ αὐτοῦ πορεύσεται, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἐκκλίνουσι τὰς
8 τρίβους αὐτῶν, καὶ ἕκαστος ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἀφέξε-
     ται· καταβαρυνόμενοι ἐν τοῖς ὅπλοις αὐτῶν πορεύσονται, καὶ ἐν
9 τοῖς βέλεσιν αὐτῶν πεσοῦνται, καὶ οὐ μὴ συντελέσουσι. Τῆς πό-
     λεως ἐπιλήψονται, καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν τειχέων δραμοῦνται, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς
     οἰκίας ἀναβήσονται, καὶ διὰ θυρίδων εἰσελεύσονται ὡς κλέπται.
10 Πρὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ συγχυθήσεται ἡ γῆ, καὶ σεισθήσεται ὁ οὐ-

**16** [of the] Lord, and as affliction upon affliction shall it come; for before our eyes are the foodstuffs utterly destroyed; from the house of your God, joy and gladness [are removed].
**17** The heifers have wandered restlessly in their stalls; the storehouses are laid waste, the winepresses are broken down, for the grain is dried up.
**18** What shall we lay up for ourselves? The herds of cattle have wept, for there was no pasture for them; and the flocks of sheep are perished.
**19** Unto Thee, O Lord, will I cry, for the fire hath consumed the fair pastures of the wilderness, and a flame hath kindled all the trees of the field.
**20** And the beasts of the field have looked up unto Thee, for the watercourses are dried up, and the fire hath consumed the fair pastures of the wilderness.

#### Chapter 2

**1** Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and proclaim ye [it] in My holy mountain; and let all the inhabitants of the land be troubled: for the day of the Lord is at hand, for it is nigh (the day of the Lord).
**2** A day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick mist. As the dawn shall be spread upon the mountains, a people great and strong; the like of whom hath not been from everlasting, neither shall there be any more after him [even] unto ages of ages.
**3** Before them a consuming fire, and behind them a kindling flame. As the garden of delight is the land before their face, and behind them a field of utter destruction; and nothing shall be preserved from them.
**4** Their appearance is as the appearance of horses, and as horsemen, so shall they pursue.
**5** As the sound of chariots, they shall leap upon the tops of the mountains; and as the sound of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, and as a great and strong people arrayed for battle.
**6** Before their face shall peoples be crushed; every face shall be as the scorching of a pot.
**7** They shall run as warriors, and as men of war, they shall go up upon the walls; and each one shall go in his own way, and they shall not turn aside from their paths.
**8** And each one shall not separate from his brother; they shall march on, though burdened with their armor, and though they stumble amidst their weapons, they shall not be brought to an end.
**9** They shall lay hold of the city, and they shall run upon the walls; and they shall go up upon the houses, and through the windows shall they enter in as thieves.
**10** Before their face, the earth shall be disturbed, and the heaven shall shake; the sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their shining.
