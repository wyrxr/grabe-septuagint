ΚΕΦ. Ηʹ. Θʹ.                                 Η Σ Α Ι Α Σ.                 1135
τότε φανεροὶ ἔσονται οἱ σφραγιζόμενοι τὸν νόμον τοῦ μαθεῖν. Καὶ 17
ἐρεῖ· μενῶ τὸν Θεὸν τὸν ἀποστρέψαντα τὸ πρόσωπον αὑτοῦ ἀπὸ
τοῦ οἴκου Ἰακώβ, καὶ πεποιθὼς ἔσομαι ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ καὶ τὰ 18
παιδία, ἃ μοι ἔδωκεν ὁ Θεός· καὶ ἔσται εἰς σημεῖα καὶ τέρατα ἐν
τῷ Ἰσραὴλ παρὰ Κυρίου Σαβαώθ, ὃς κατοικεῖ ἐν τῷ ὄρει Σιών.
Καὶ ἐὰν εἴπωσι πρὸς ὑμᾶς· ζητήσατε τοὺς ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς φωνοῦν- 19
τας, καὶ τοὺς ἐγγαστριμύθους τοὺς κενολογοῦντας, οἱ ἀπὸ τῆς
κοιλίας φωνοῦσιν, οὐκ ἔθνος πρὸς Θεὸν αὑτοῦ ἐκζητήσουσι; τί
ἐκζητοῦσι περὶ τῶν ζώντων τοὺς νεκρούς; Νόμον γὰρ εἰς βοή- 20
θειαν ἔδωκεν, ἵνα εἴπωσιν οὐχ ὡς τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο, περὶ οὗ οὐκ
ἔστι δῶρα δοῦναι περὶ αὑτοῦ. Καὶ ἥξει ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς σκληρὰ λιμός, 21
καὶ ἔσται, ὡς ἂν πεινάσητε, λυπηθήσεσθε, καὶ κακῶς ἐρεῖτε τὸν
ἄρχοντα καὶ τὰ πάτρια· καὶ ἀναβλέψονται εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν ἄνω,
καὶ εἰς τὴν γῆν κάτω ἐμβλέψονται, καὶ ἰδοὺ θλίψις, καὶ στενοχω- 22
ρία καὶ σκότος, ἀπορία στενὴ καὶ σκότος, ὥστε μὴ βλέπειν, καὶ
οὐκ ἀπορηθήσεται ὁ ἐν στενοχωρίᾳ ὢν ἕως καιροῦ.

ΚΕΦ. Θʹ. IX.

Τοῦτο πρῶτον (πίε) ταχὺ ποιεῖ. χώρα Ζαβουλών, ἢ γῆ Νε- 1
φθαλείμ ὁδὸν θαλάσσης, καὶ οἱ λοιποὶ οἱ τὴν παραλίαν κατοικοῦντες,
καὶ πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου, Γαλιλαία τῶν ἐθνῶν, τὰ μέρη τῆς
Ἰουδαίας· ὁ λαὸς ὁ πορευόμενος ἐν σκότει, ἴδετε φῶς μέγα· οἱ 2
κατοικοῦντες ἐν χώρᾳ σκιᾶς θανάτου, φῶς λάμψει ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς. Τὸ 3
πλεῖστον τοῦ λαοῦ, ὃ κατήγαγες ἐν εὐφροσύνῃ σου· καὶ εὐφραν-
θήσονται ἐνώπιον σου, ὡς οἱ εὐφραινόμενοι ἐν ἀμήτῳ, καὶ ὃν τρόπον
εὐφραίνονται οἱ διαιρούμενοι σκῦλα. Διότι ἀφῄρηται ὁ ζυγὸς ὁ ἐπ᾿ 4
αὐτῶν κείμενος, καὶ ἡ ῥάβδος ἡ ἐπὶ τοῦ τραχήλου αὐτῶν· τὴν γὰρ
ῥάβδον τῶν ἀπαιτούντων διεσκέδασκε Κύριος, ὡς τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἐπὶ
Μαδιάμ. Ὅτι πᾶσαν στολὴν ἐπισυνηγμένην δόλῳ καὶ ἱμάτιον 5
μετὰ καταλλαγῆς ἀποτίσουσι, καὶ θελήσουσιν, εἰ ἐγενήθησαν
πυρίκαυστοι. Ὅτι παιδίον ἐγεννήθη ἡμῖν, υἱὸς καὶ ἐδόθη ἡμῖν, 6
οὗ ἡ ἀρχὴ ἐγενήθη ἐπὶ τοῦ ὤμου αὐτοῦ· καὶ καλεῖται τὸ ὄνομα
αὐτοῦ μεγάλης βουλῆς ἄγγελος, θαυμαστός, σύμβουλος, ἰσχυρός,
ἐξουσιαστής, ἄρχων εἰρήνης, πατὴρ τοῦ μέλλοντος αἰῶνος. Ἐγὼ
γὰρ ἄξω εἰρήνην ἐπὶ τοὺς ἄρχοντας, εἰρήνην καὶ ὑγείαν αὐτῷ.

**16** Then shall they be made manifest who seal the law unto learning.
**17** And [the Prophet] shall say, "I will await the God who hath turned away His face from the house of Jacob, and I shall be trusting in Him."
**18** "Behold, I and the children whom God hath given me; and [we] shall be for signs and for wonders in Israel from the Lord of Hosts, who dwelleth in Mount Zion."
**19** And if they shall say unto you, "Seek ye them that call from the earth, and the ventriloquists that speak empty words, who call from the belly," [reply,] "Shall not a nation seek unto its God? Why do they seek for the living among the dead?"
**20** For He hath given the Law for [our] help, that they may speak; if [they speak] not according to this word, concerning which it is not possible to give gifts for its own sake!
**21** And a harsh famine shall come upon you; and it shall be, when ye hunger, ye shall be grieved, and ye shall speak evil of the ruler and of the ancestral customs. And they shall look up unto heaven above,
**22** And upon the earth below shall they look; and behold, [there shall be] affliction, and tribulation, and darkness, a narrow perplexity and darkness, so that they cannot see. And he that is in tribulation shall not be left without recourse until a season [appointed].

**CHAPTER 9**
**1** This first, (drink!) doth swiftly accomplish. The land of Zebulun, or the land of Naphtali, by the way of the sea; and the remnant that dwell on the coast, and beyond the Jordan, [even] Galilee of the Gentiles, the parts of Judea.
**2** O people that walketh in darkness, behold a great light! Ye that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon you shall light shine.
**3** Thou hast multiplied the nation, and brought them forth in Thy joy. And they shall rejoice before Thee as those that rejoice in harvest, and in the manner that they rejoice who divide spoils.
**4** For the yoke that lay upon them hath been removed, and the rod that was upon their neck. For the Lord hath scattered the rod of them that exacted tribute, as in the day of Midian.
**5** For every robe gathered by deceit, and [every] garment, they shall repay with reconciliation; and they shall wish that they had been burned with fire.
**6** For a child is born unto us, a son is given unto us, whose dominion was upon his shoulder. And His Name shall be called Angel of Great Counsel, Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty, Possessor of Authority, Prince of Peace, Father of the Age to Come.
**7** For I shall bring peace upon the rulers, even peace and health to Him.
