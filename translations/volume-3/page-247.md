στησάτω ἔλεος, καὶ δικαιοσύνη ἀνατειλάτω ἅμα· ἐγώ εἰμι
Κύριος ὁ κτίσας σε. Ποῖον βέλτιον κατεσκεύασα ὡς πηλὸν κε- 9
ραμέως; μὴ ὁ ἀροτριῶν ἀροτριάσει τὴν γῆν; μὴ ἐρεῖ ὁ πηλὸς
τῷ κεραμεῖ, τί ποιεῖς, ὅτι οὐκ ἐργάζῃ, οὐδὲ ἔχεις χεῖρας; Οὐαὶ 10
ὁ λέγων τῷ πατρί, τί γεννήσεις; καὶ τῇ μητρί, τί ὠδίνησις;
Ὅτι οὕτως λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὁ ἅγιος Ἰσραήλ, ὁ ποιήσας 11
αὐτόν· τὰ ἐπερχόμενα ἐρωτήσατέ με περὶ τῶν υἱῶν μου, καὶ
περὶ τῶν θυγατέρων μου, καὶ περὶ τῶν ἔργων τῶν χειρῶν μου
ἐντείλασθέ μοι. Ἐγὼ ἐποίησα γῆν, καὶ ἄνθρωπον ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς, 12
ἐγὼ τῇ χειρί μου ἐστερέωσα τὸν οὐρανόν, ἐγὼ πᾶσι τοῖς ἄστροις
ἐνετειλάμην. Ἐγὼ ἤγειρα αὐτὸν μετὰ δικαιοσύνης, καὶ πᾶσαι 13
αἱ ὁδοὶ αὐτοῦ εὐθεῖαι. αὐτὸς οἰκοδομήσει τὴν πόλιν μου, καὶ
τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν τοῦ λαοῦ μου ἐπιστρέψει, οὐ μετὰ λύτρων,
οὐδὲ μετὰ δώρων, εἶπε Κύριος Σαβαώθ. Οὕτως λέγει Κύριος 14
Σαβαώθ· ἐκοπίασεν Αἴγυπτος, καὶ ἐμπορία Αἰθιόπων, καὶ οἱ Σα-
βαεὶμ ἄνδρες ὑψηλοὶ ἐπὶ σὲ διαβήσονται, καὶ σοὶ ἔσονται δοῦ-
λοι, καὶ ὀπίσω σου ἀκολουθήσουσι δεδεμένοι χειροπέδαις, καὶ
διαβήσονται πρὸς σέ, καὶ προσκυνήσουσί σοι, καὶ ἐν σοὶ προσεύ-
ξονται· ὅτι ἐν σοὶ ὁ Θεός ἐστι, καὶ (ἐροῦσιν) οὐκ ἔστιν ὁ
Θεὸς πλὴν σοῦ. Σὺ γὰρ εἶ Θεός, καὶ οὐκ ᾔδειμεν, ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ 15
Ἰσραὴλ σωτήρ. Αἰσχυνθήσονται καὶ ἐντραπήσονται πάντες οἱ 16
ἀντικείμενοι αὐτῷ, καὶ πορεύσονται ἐν αἰσχύνῃ· ἐγκαινίζεσθε
πρός με νῆσοι. Ἰσραὴλ σώζεται ὑπὸ Κυρίου σωτηρίαν αἰώνιον· 17
οὐκ αἰσχυνθήσονται, οὐδὲ μὴ ἐντραπῶσιν ἕως τοῦ αἰῶνος ἔτι.
Ὅτι οὕτως λέγει Κύριος ὁ ποιήσας τὸν οὐρανόν, οὗτος ὁ Θεὸς 18
ὁ καταδείξας τὴν γῆν, καὶ ποιήσας αὐτήν, αὐτὸς διώρισεν αὐ-
τήν, οὐκ εἰς κενὸν ἐποίησεν αὐτήν, ἀλλὰ κατοικεῖσθαι ἔπλα-
σεν αὐτήν· ἐγώ εἰμι Κύριος, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἔτι. Οὐκ ἐν κρυφῇ 19
λελάληκα, οὐδὲ ἐν τόπῳ γῆς σκοτεινῷ· οὐκ εἶπα τῷ σπέρματι
Ἰακώβ, μάταιον ζητήσατε· ἐγώ εἰμι, ἐγώ εἰμι Κύριος λαλῶν
δικαιοσύνην, καὶ ἀναγγέλλων ἀλήθειαν. Συνάχθητε, καὶ ἥκετε, 20
βουλεύσασθε ἅμα οἱ σωζόμενοι ἀπὸ τῶν ἐθνῶν· οὐκ ἔγνωσαν
οἱ αἴροντες τὸ ξύλον γλύμμα αὐτῶν, καὶ προσευχόμενοι ὡς πρὸς
θεούς, οἳ οὐ σώσουσιν. Εἰ ἀναγγελοῦσιν, ἐγγισάτωσαν, ἵνα γνῶσιν 21
ἅμα, τίς ἀκουστὰ ἐποίησε ταῦτα ἀπ᾿ ἀρχῆς· τότε ἀνηγγέλη ὑ-
μῖν· ἐγὼ ὁ Θεός, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἄλλος πλὴν ἐμοῦ· δίκαιος καὶ

#### Chapter 45

**8** mercy, and let righteousness spring up together.
    I am the Lord who hath created thee.
**9** Have I fashioned anything more excellent
    than [that which I form from] the potter's clay?
    Shall the plowman plow the earth?
    Shall the clay say to the potter, 'What dost thou?'
    [Or] 'Thou dost not labor, nor hast thou hands?'
**10** Woe unto him that saith to his father, 'What shalt thou beget?'
    And to his mother, 'What travail dost thou endure?'
**11** For thus saith the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel,
    He that hath made him:
    'Concerning the things to come,
    ask ye Me about My sons and My daughters,
    and concerning the works of My hands,
    command ye Me.'
**12** I have made the earth, and man upon it;
    I by My hand established the heaven;
    I gave command unto all the stars.
**13** I raised him up in righteousness,
    and all his ways are straight.
    He shall build My city,
    and shall turn back the captivity of My people,
    not with ransom, nor with gifts,
    saith the Lord Sabaoth.
**14** Thus saith the Lord Sabaoth:
    The labor of Egypt, and the commerce of the Ethiopians,
    and the Sabaeans, men of lofty stature,
    shall cross over unto thee,
    and they shall be thy servants,
    and they shall follow after thee,
    bound with chains;
    and they shall cross over unto thee,
    and shall bow down before thee,
    and in thee shall they pray;
    for in thee is God, and (they shall say)
    'There is no God save thee.'
**15** For Thou art God, and we knew it not,
    the God of Israel, the Savior.
**16** All those who are opposed to Him
    shall be put to shame and be confounded,
    and shall walk in shame.
    Be ye renewed unto Me, O islands.
**17** Israel is saved by the Lord
    with an eternal salvation;
    they shall not be put to shame,
    nor shall they be confounded forevermore.
**18** For thus saith the Lord,
    He that made the heaven,
    this God that set forth the earth and made it,
    He Himself apportioned it;
    He made it not in vain,
    but He formed it to be inhabited.
    I am the Lord, and there is none other.
**19** I have not spoken in secret,
    nor in a dark place of the earth;
    I said not to the seed of Jacob,
    'Seek ye vain things.'
    I am, I am the Lord,
    speaking righteousness and declaring truth.
**20** Assemble yourselves, and come;
    deliberate together, ye that are saved from the nations.
    They knew not, those who carry the wood, their graven image,
    and pray unto [them] as to gods,
    which shall not save [them].
**21** If they shall declare [anything],
    let them draw near, that they may know together,
    who hath made these things audible from the beginning.
    Then was it declared unto you:
    'I am God, and there is none other save Me;
    righteous and—'
