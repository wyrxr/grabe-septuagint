30 καὶ ᾧ ἂν δόξῃ, δώσει αὐτήν. Αὕτῃ τῇ ὥρᾳ ὁ λόγος συνετελέσθη ἐπὶ Ναβουχοδονόσορ τὸν βασιλέα, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ἀνθρώπων ἐξεδιώχθη, καὶ χόρτον ὡς βοῦς ἤσθιε, καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς δρόσου τοῦ οὐρανοῦ τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ ἐβάφη, ἕως οὗ αἱ τρίχες αὐτοῦ ὡς λεόντων ἐμεγαλύνθησαν, καὶ οἱ ὄνυχες αὐτοῦ ὡς ὀρνέων.
31 Καὶ μετὰ τὸ τέλος τῶν ἡμερῶν ἐγὼ Ναβουχοδονόσορ τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς μου εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν ἀνέλαβον, καὶ αἱ φρένες μου ἐπ᾽ ἐμὲ ἐπεστράφησαν, καὶ τῷ ὑψίστῳ ηὐλόγησα, καὶ τῷ ζῶντι εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα ὕμνησα, καὶ ἐδόξασα, ὅτι ἡ ἐξουσία αὐτοῦ ἐξουσία αἰώνιος, καὶ
32 ἡ βασιλεία αὐτοῦ εἰς γενεὰν καὶ γενεάν, καὶ πάντες οἱ κατοικοῦντες τὴν γῆν ὡς οὐδὲν ἐλογίσθησαν· καὶ κατὰ τὸ θέλημα αὐτοῦ ποιεῖ ἐν τῇ δυνάμει τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ ἐν τῇ κατοικίᾳ τῆς γῆς· καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ὃς ἀντιποιήσεται τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐρεῖ αὐτῷ, τί ἐποίησας;
33 Αὐτῷ τῷ καιρῷ αἱ φρένες μου ἐπεστράφησαν ἐπ᾽ ἐμέ, καὶ εἰς τὴν τιμὴν τῆς βασιλείας μου ἦλθον· καὶ ἡ μορφή μου ἐπέστρεψεν ἐπ᾽ ἐμέ, καὶ οἱ τύραννοί μου καὶ οἱ μεγιστάνες μου ἐζήτουν με, καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν βασιλείαν μου ἐκραταιώθην, καὶ μεγαλωσύνη περισσοτέρα προσετέθη μοι.
34 Νῦν οὖν ἐγὼ Ναβουχοδονόσορ αἰνῶ καὶ ὑπερυψῶ, καὶ δοξάζω τὸν βασιλέα τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, ὅτι πάντα τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ ἀληθινά, καὶ αἱ τρίβοι αὐτοῦ κρίσεις, καὶ πάντας τοὺς πορευομένους ἐν ὑπερηφανίᾳ δύναται ταπεινῶσαι.

1 ΒΑΛΤΑΣΑΡ ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐποίησε δεῖπνον μέγα τοῖς μεγιστᾶσιν αὐτοῦ ἀνδράσι χιλίοις, καὶ κατέναντι τῶν χιλίων ὁ οἶνος,
2 καὶ πίνων Βαλτάσαρ εἶπεν ἐν τῇ γεύσει τοῦ οἴνου, τοῦ ἐνεγκεῖν τὰ σκεύη τὰ χρυσᾶ καὶ τὰ ἀργυρᾶ, ἃ ἐξήνεγκε Ναβουχοδονόσορ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ ἐκ τοῦ ναοῦ τοῦ ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ πιέτωσαν ἐν αὐτοῖς ὁ βασιλεύς, καὶ οἱ μεγιστᾶνες αὐτοῦ, καὶ αἱ παλλακαὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ αἱ παράκοιτοι αὐτοῦ.
3 Καὶ ἠνέχθησαν τὰ σκεύη τὰ χρυσᾶ καὶ τὰ ἀργυρᾶ, ἃ ἐξήνεγκεν ἐκ τοῦ ναοῦ τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ ἐν

**Chapter IV.**

**30** and to whomsoever it shall please Him, He will give it. At that same hour the word was fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar the King: and from among men was he driven out, and he did eat grass like an ox, and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven, until his hair was grown long like lions', and his nails like birds'.

**31** And after the end of the days, I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and my understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and glorified Him that liveth forever; because His dominion is an everlasting dominion, and His kingdom endureth from generation to generation.

**32** And all the inhabitants of the earth were accounted as naught; and He doeth according to His will in the power of heaven, and in the habitation of the earth: and there is none that shall resist His hand, or say unto Him, "What hast Thou done?"

**33** At that same time my understanding returned unto me, and I came to the honor of my kingdom; and my visage was restored unto me, and my nobles and my magnates sought me; and I was established in my kingdom, and exceeding great majesty was added unto me.

**34** Now therefore I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and glorify the King of heaven, because all His works are true, and His ways are judgments, and He is able to humble all them that walk in pride.

**Chapter V.**

**1** Belshazzar the King made a great feast for his thousand lords, and before the thousand was the wine.

**2** And Belshazzar, as he drank, commanded, while tasting the wine, to bring forth the vessels of gold and of silver, which Nebuchadnezzar his father had brought forth out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, that the king and his lords and his concubines and his royal consorts might drink therein.

**3** Then were brought forth the vessels of gold and of silver, which he had taken out of the temple of God that was in Jerusalem.
