μοι ἔλαιον καὶ σμῆγμα, καὶ τὰς θύρας τοῦ παραδείσου κλείσατε,
ὅπως λούσωμαι. Καὶ ἐποίησαν, καὶ ἀπέκλεισαν τὰς θύρας τοῦ 18
παραδείσου, καθώς εἶπε, καὶ ἐξῆλθον κατὰ τὰς πλαγίους θύρας,
ἐνέγκαι τὰ προστεταγμένα αὐταῖς, καὶ οὐκ εἶδαν τοὺς πρεσ-
βυτέρους, ὅτι ἦσαν κεκρυμμένοι. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἐξῆλθον τὰ κο- 19
ράσια, καὶ ἀνέστησαν οἱ δύο πρεσβύτεροι, καὶ ἐπέδραμον αὐτῇ,
καὶ εἶπον· ἰδοὺ αἱ θύραι τοῦ παραδείσου κέκλεινται, καὶ οὐδεὶς 20
θεωρεῖ ἡμᾶς, καὶ ἐν ἐπιθυμίᾳ σου ἐσμέν· διὸ συγκατάθου ἡμῖν,
καὶ γενοῦ μεθ᾽ ἡμῶν. Εἰ δὲ μή, καταμαρτυρήσομέν σου, ὅτι ἦν 21
μετά σοῦ νεανίσκος, καὶ διὰ τοῦτο ἐξαπέστειλας τὰ κοράσια ἀπὸ
σοῦ. Καὶ ἀνεστέναξε Σουσάννα, καὶ εἶπε· στενά μοι πάντοθεν· 22
ἐάν τε γὰρ τοῦτο πράξω, θάνατός μοι ἐστιν· ἐὰν τε μὴ πράξω,
οὐκ ἐκφεύξομαι τὰς χεῖρας ὑμῶν. Αἱρετόν μοι ἐστὶ μὴ πράξα- 23
σαν ἐμπεσεῖν εἰς τὰς χεῖρας ὑμῶν, ἢ ἁμαρτεῖν με ἐνώπιον Κυ-
ρίου. Καὶ ἀνεβόησε φωνὴ μεγάλη Σουσάννα· ἐβόησαν δὲ καὶ οἱ δύο 24
πρεσβύτεροι κατέναντι αὐτῆς. Καὶ δραμὼν ὁ εἷς, ἤνοιξε τὰς θύ- 25
ρας τοῦ παραδείσου, ὡς δὲ ἤκουσαν τὴν κραυγὴν ἐν τῷ παρα- 26
δείσῳ οἱ ἀπὸ τῆς οἰκίας, εἰσεπήδησαν διὰ τῆς πλαγίας θύρας, ἰ-
δεῖν τί τὸ συμβεβηκὸς αὐτῇ. Ἡνίκα δὲ εἶπαν οἱ πρεσβύτεροι 27
τοὺς λόγους αὐτῶν, κατησχύνθησαν οἱ δοῦλοι σφόδρα, ὅτι πώποτε
οὐκ ἐῤῥέθη λόγος τοιοῦτος περὶ Σουσάννας. Καὶ ἐγένετο τῇ 28
ἐπαύριον, ὡς συνῆλθεν ὁ λαὸς πρὸς τὸν ἄνδρα αὐτῆς Ἰωακείμ,
ἦλθον οἱ δύο πρεσβύτεροι πλήρεις τῆς ἀνόμου ἐννοίας κατὰ Σου-
σάννας, τοῦ θανατῶσαι αὐτήν, καὶ εἶπαν ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ λαοῦ. Ἀ- 29
ποστείλατε ἐπὶ Σουσάνναν θυγατέρα Χελκίου, ἥ ἐστι γυνὴ Ἰωαχείμ·
οἱ δὲ ἀπέστειλαν. Καὶ ἦλθεν αὐτή, καὶ οἱ γονεῖς αὐτῆς, 30
καὶ τὰ τέκνα αὐτῆς, καὶ πάντες οἱ συγγενεῖς αὐτῆς. Ἡ δὲ Σου- 31
σάννα ἦν τρυφερὰ σφόδρα, καὶ καλὴ τῷ εἴδει. Οἱ δὲ παράνομοι 32
ἐκέλευσαν ἀποκαλυφθῆναι αὐτήν, ἦν γὰρ κατακεκαλυμμένη, ὅπως
ἐμπλησθῶσι τοῦ κάλλους αὐτῆς. Ἔκλαιον δὲ οἱ παρ᾽ αὐτῆς, 33
καὶ πάντες οἱ ἰδόντες αὐτήν. Ἀναστάντες δὲ οἱ δύο πρεσβύτεροι 34
ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ λαοῦ, ἔθηκαν τὰς χεῖρας ἐπὶ τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτῆς.
Ἡ δὲ κλαίουσα ἀνέβλεψεν εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν, ὅτι ἦν ἡ καρδία 35
αὐτῆς πεποιθυῖα ἐπὶ τῷ Κυρίῳ. Εἶπαν δὲ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι· περι- 36
πατούντων ἡμῶν ἐν τῷ παραδείσῳ μόνων, εἰσῆλθεν αὕτη μετά
δύο παιδισκῶν, καὶ ἀπέκλεισε τὰς παιδίσκας, καὶ ἀπέκλεισε τὰς

¹¹...bring me now oil and cleansing balm, and shut the garden gates, that I may bathe."

¹⁸ And they did so; and they shut the gates of the garden, as she had commanded, and went forth by the side-gates to bring that which had been commanded them. But they saw not the elders, for they were hidden.

¹⁹ And it came to pass, when the maidens were gone forth, that the two elders rose up and ran unto her,

²⁰ and said, "Behold, the gates of the garden are shut, and no man seeth us; and we are inflamed with lust for thee. Wherefore consent now unto us, and lie with us.

²¹ But if thou wilt not, we shall bear witness against thee, that there was a young man with thee, and for this cause thou didst send away thy maidens from thee."

²² Then Susanna sighed deeply, and said, "I am straitened on every side. For if I do this thing, it is death unto me; and if I do it not, I shall not escape your hands.

²³ It is better for me to fall into your hands without committing this deed, than to sin in the sight of the Lord."

²⁴ Then Susanna cried with a loud voice; and the two elders also cried out against her.

²⁵ And one of them ran and opened the gates of the garden.

²⁶ And when those of the household heard the cry in the garden, they rushed in by the side-gate to see what had befallen her.

²⁷ And when the elders had spoken their words, the servants were exceedingly ashamed, for never before had such a report been uttered concerning Susanna.

²⁸ And it came to pass on the morrow, when the people were gathered together to Joachim her husband, that the two elders came, full of their lawless purpose against Susanna, to put her to death, and they spake before the people:

²⁹ "Send for Susanna, the daughter of Hilkiah, who is the wife of Joachim." And they sent for her.

³⁰ And she came, and her parents, and her children, and all her kindred.

³¹ Now Susanna was exceeding delicate, and beautiful in appearance.

³² Then the lawless men commanded that she should be unveiled (for she was veiled), that they might feast their eyes upon her beauty.

³³ And her kindred wept, and all who beheld her.

³⁴ And the two elders stood up in the midst of the people and laid their hands upon her head.

³⁵ But she, weeping, looked up toward heaven; for her heart was fixed upon the Lord.

³⁶ Then the elders said, "As we walked alone in the garden, this woman came in with two maidens, and she shut the maidens [out], and she shut the..."
