ΚΕΦ. ΚΗ΄. ΙΕΡΕΜΙΑΣ 1265
ἐγὼ κρινῶ τὴν ἀντίδικόν σου, καὶ ἐκδικήσω τὴν ἐκδίκησίν σου,
καὶ ἐρημώσω τὴν θάλασσαν αὐτῆς, καὶ ξηρανῶ τὴν πηγὴν αὐ-
τῆς. Καὶ ἔσται Βαβυλὼν εἰς ἀφανισμόν, καὶ εἰς κατοικίαν δρα- 37
κόντων, καὶ εἰς θῖνας, καὶ εἰς συριγμόν, καὶ οὐ κατοικηθήσεται.
Ὡς λέοντες ἐξηγέρθησαν ἅμα, καὶ οἱ νεανίσκοι αὐτῶν ὡς σκύ- 38
μνοι λεόντων. Ἐν τῇ θερμασίᾳ αὐτῶν δώσω πότημα αὐτοῖς, καὶ 39
μεθύσω αὐτοὺς, ὅπως καρδωθῶσι, καὶ ὑπνώσωσιν ὕπνον αἰώνιον,
καὶ οὐ μὴ ἐξεγερθῶσι, λέγει Κύριος. Καταβίβασον αὐτοὺς ὡς 40
ἄρνας εἰς σφαγήν, καὶ ὡς χριοὺς μετ᾿ ἐρίφων. Πῶς ἔαλω Σι- 41
σάχ, καὶ ἐθηρεύθη τὸ καύχημα πάσης τῆς γῆς; πῶς ἐγένετο
Βαβυλὼν εἰς ἀφανισμὸν ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν; Ἀνέβη ἐπὶ Βαβυλῶνα 42
ἡ θάλασσα ἐν ἤχῳ κυμάτων αὐτῆς, καὶ κατεκαλύφθη. Ἐγενή- 43
θησαν αἱ πόλεις αὐτῆς εἰς ἀφανισμόν, γῆ ἄνυδρος καὶ ἄβατος,
γῆ ἐν ᾗ οὐ κατοικήσει ἐν αὐτῇ οὐδὲ εἷς, οὐδὲ μὴ καταλύσει ἐν
αὐτῇ υἱὸς ἀνθρώπου. Καὶ ἐκδικήσω ἐπὶ τὸν Βὴλ ἐν Βαβυλῶνι, 44
καὶ ἐξοίσω ἃ κατέπιεν ἐκ τοῦ στόματος αὐτῆς, καὶ οὐ μὴ συ-
ναχθῶσιν ἔτι πρὸς αὐτὴν τὰ ἔθνη, καίγε τεῖχος Βαβυλῶνος
πεσεῖται. Ἐξέλθετε ἀπὸ μέσου αὐτοῦ λαός ἐμός, καὶ σώσατε 45
ἕκαστος τὴν ἑαυτοῦ ψυχὴν ἀπὸ ὀργῆς θυμοῦ Κυρίου. Μήποτε 46
ἀπαλωθῇ ἡ καρδία ὑμῶν, καὶ φοβηθῆτε διὰ τὴν ἀκοήν, ἢ ἀκου-
σθήσεται ἐν τῇ γῇ, καὶ ἥξει ἐν ἐνιαυτῷ ἀκοή, καὶ μετὰ τὸν
ἔνετον ἀκοή, ταλαιπωρία, καὶ ἀδικία ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, καὶ κυριεύων
ἐπὶ κυριεύοντα. Διὰ τοῦτο ἰδοὺ ἡμέραι ἔρχονται, καὶ ἐκδικήσω 47
ἐπὶ τὰ γλυπτὰ Βαβυλῶνος˙ καὶ πᾶσα ἡ γῆ αὐτῶν αἰσχυνθήσε-
ται, πάντες τραυματίαι αὐτῆς πεσοῦνται ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῆς. Καὶ 48
εὐφρανθήσονται ἐπὶ Βαβυλῶνα οἱ οὐρανοί, καὶ ἡ γῆ, καὶ πάντα
τὰ ἐν αὐτοῖς˙ ὅτι ἀπὸ βορρᾶ ἔρχονται πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐξολοθρεύον-
τες, λέγει Κύριος˙ καίγε Βαβυλὼν πεσεῖν ἐποίησε τοὺς τραυ-
ματίας Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐν Βαβυλῶνι πεσοῦνται τραυματίαι πάσης 49
τῆς γῆς. Ἀνασωζόμενοι ἐκ γῆς πορεύεσθε, μὴ ἵστασθε˙ οἱ μακρό- 50
θεν μνήσθητε τοῦ Κυρίου, καὶ Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἀναβήτω ἐπὶ τὴν καρ-
δίαν ὑμῶν. Ἤσχύνθημεν, ὅτι ἠκούσαμεν ὀνειδισμὸν ἡμῶν, κατεκά- 51
λυψεν ἀτιμία τὸ πρόσωπον ἡμῶν, εἰσῆλθον ἀλλογενεῖς εἰς τὰ ἅγια
ἡμῶν, εἰς οἶκον Κυρίου. Διὰ τοῦτο ἰδοὺ ἡμέραι ἔρχονται, λέγει Κύ- 52
ριος, καὶ ἐκδικήσω ἐπὶ τὰ γλυπτὰ αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ αὐτῆς
πεσοῦνται τραυματίαι. Ὅτι ἐὰν ἀναβῇ Βαβυλὼν ὡς ὁ οὐρανός, καὶ

**Jeremiah, Chapter 28**
(Hebrew Chapter 51)

**36** I shall judge thy adversary, and I shall avenge thy vengeance; and I will lay waste her sea, and dry up her spring.
**37** And Babylon shall be for a desolation, and for a dwelling of dragons, and for sand-heaps, and for a hissing; and it shall not be inhabited.
**38** As lions were they stirred up together, and their young men as lion’s whelps.
**39** In their heat will I give them drink, and I will make them drunk, that they may be stupefied, and shall sleep an eternal sleep, and shall not awake, saith the Lord.
**40** Bring them down as lambs to the slaughter, and as rams with kids.
**41** How is Sheshach taken? And how is the boast of all the earth caught? How is Babylon become a desolation among the nations?
**42** The sea hath come up against Babylon with the sound of her waves, and she is covered.
**43** Her cities are become a desolation, a land without water and impassable; a land wherein no one shall dwell in it, nor shall a son of man lodge in it.
**44** And I will execute judgment upon Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth that which he hath swallowed out of his mouth; and the nations shall no longer gather unto him; yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall.
**45** Come forth from the midst of her, O My people, and save ye every man his own soul from the fierce wrath of the Lord.
**46** Lest your heart become tender, and ye fear because of the rumour when it shall be heard in the land, and in one year shall come a rumour, and after the current year, a rumour; distress and injustice upon the land, and ruler upon ruler.
**47** Therefore, behold, the days come, and I will execute judgment upon the graven images of Babylon; and all her land shall be ashamed; all her wounded shall fall in her midst.
**48** And the heavens shall rejoice over Babylon, and the earth, and all that is therein; for from the north come against him those who destroy, saith the Lord; yea, Babylon hath caused to fall the wounded of Israel, and in Babylon shall fall the wounded of all the earth.
**49** Ye that are escaped from the land, depart, stand not still; ye that are far off, remember the Lord; and let Jerusalem ascend upon your heart.
**50** We are ashamed, for we have heard our reproach; dishonour hath covered our face; aliens have entered into our holies, into the house of the Lord.
**51** Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord, and I will execute judgment upon her graven images, and in all her land shall the wounded fall.
**52** For though Babylon should ascend as high as heaven, and
