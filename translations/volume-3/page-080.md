ΨΑΛΜ. ΡΔ´.
12 γῆν Χαναὰν, σχοίνισμα κληρονομίας ὑμῶν· ἐν τῷ εἶναι αὐτοὺς
13 ἀριθμῷ βραχεῖς, ὀλιγοστοὺς καὶ παροίκους ἐν αὐτῇ. Καὶ διῆλθον
14 ἐξ ἔθνους εἰς ἔθνος, καὶ ἐκ βασιλείας εἰς λαὸν ἕτερον· οὐκ ἀφῆκεν
15 ἄνθρωπον ἀδικῆσαι αὐτοὺς, καὶ ἤλεγξεν ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν βασιλεῖς· μὴ
    ἅπτεσθε τῶν χριστῶν μου, καὶ ἐν τοῖς προφήταις μου μὴ πονηρεύεσθε.
16 Καὶ ἐκάλεσε λιμὸν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν· πᾶν στήριγμα ἄρτου συνέτριψεν.
17 Ἐξαπέστειλεν ἔμπροσθεν αὐτῶν ἄνθρωπον, εἰς δοῦλον
18 ἐπράθη Ἰωσήφ. Ἐταπείνωσαν ἐν πέδαις τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ, σίδηρον
    διῆλθεν ἡ ψυχὴ αὐτοῦ·
19 μέχρι τοῦ ἐλθεῖν τὸν λόγον αὐτοῦ, τὸ
20 λόγιον Κυρίου ἐπύρωσεν αὐτόν.
21 Ἀπέστειλε βασιλεὺς καὶ ἔλυσεν αὐτόν· ἄρχων λαῶν, καὶ ἀφῆκεν αὐτόν.
22 Κατέστησεν αὐτὸν κύριον τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἄρχοντα πάσης τῆς
    κτήσεως αὐτοῦ·
23 τοῦ παιδεῦσαι τοὺς ἄρχοντας αὐτοῦ ὡς ἑαυτὸν, καὶ τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους
    αὐτοῦ σοφίσαι.
24 Καὶ εἰσῆλθεν Ἰσραὴλ εἰς Αἴγυπτον, καὶ Ἰακὼβ παρώκησεν ἐν γῇ Χάμ·
25 καὶ ηὔξησε τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ σφόδρα, καὶ ἐκραταίωσεν αὐτὸν ὑπὲρ τοὺς
    ἐχθροὺς αὐτοῦ.
26 Μετέστρεψε τὴν καρδίαν αὐτῶν τοῦ μισῆσαι τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ, τοῦ
    δολιοῦσθαι ἐν τοῖς δούλοις αὐτοῦ·
27 ἐξαπέστειλε Μωυσῆν τὸν δοῦλον αὐτοῦ, Ἀαρὼν ὃν ἐξελέξατο αὐτόν.
28 Ἔθετο ἐν αὐτοῖς τοὺς λόγους τῶν σημείων αὐτοῦ καὶ τῶν τεράτων (αὐτοῦ)
    ἐν γῇ Χάμ·
29 ἐξαπέστειλε σκότος· καὶ ἐσκότασε, καὶ οὐ παρεπίκραναν τοὺς λόγους
    αὐτοῦ. Μετέστρεψε τὰ ὕδατα αὐτῶν εἰς αἷμα, καὶ ἀπέκτεινε τοὺς ἰχθύας
    αὐτῶν.
30 Ἐξῆρεν ἡ γῆ αὐτῶν βατράχους ἐν τοῖς ταμείοις τῶν βασιλέων αὐτῶν·
    εἶπε, καὶ ἦλθε κυνόμυια, καὶ σκνῖφες ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς ὁρίοις
31 αὐτῶν. Ἔθετο τὰς βροχὰς αὐτῶν χάλαζαν, πῦρ καταφλέγον ἐν
33 τῇ γῇ αὐτῶν· καὶ ἐπάταξε τὰς ἀμπέλους αὐτῶν καὶ τὰς συκᾶς
34 αὐτῶν, καὶ συνέτριψε (πᾶν) ξύλον ὁρίου αὐτῶν.
35 Εἶπε, καὶ ἦλθεν ἀκρὶς καὶ βροῦχος, οὗ οὐκ ἦν ἀριθμός· καὶ κατέφαγε
    πάντα χόρτον ἐν τῇ γῇ αὐτῶν, καὶ κατέφαγε πάντα τὸν καρπὸν τῆς
    γῆς αὐτῶν.
36 Καὶ ἐπάταξε πᾶν πρωτότοκον ἐν τῇ γῇ αὐτῶν, ἀπαρχὴν
37 παντὸς πόνου αὐτῶν· καὶ ἐξήγαγεν αὐτοὺς ἐν ἀργυρίῳ καὶ χρυσίῳ,
    καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἐν ταῖς φυλαῖς αὐτῶν ἀσθενῶν.
38 Εὐφράνθη Αἴγυπτος ἐν τῇ ἐξόδῳ αὐτῶν· ὅτι ἐπέπεσεν ὁ φόβος αὐτῶν
    ἐπ᾿ αὐτούς.
39 Διεπέτασε νεφέλην εἰς σκέπην αὐτοῖς, καὶ πῦρ τοῦ φωτίσαι αὐτοῖς
    τὴν νύκτα.
40 Ἤτησαν καὶ ἦλθεν ὀρτυγομήτρα, καὶ ἄρτον οὐρανοῦ ἐνέπλησεν αὐτούς·
41 διέρρηξε πέτραν, καὶ ἐῤῥύησαν ὕδατα,

**PSALM CIV.** (continued)

12 ...the land of Canaan, the measuring-line of your inheritance;"
13 When they were but few in number, few, and sojourners within it.
14 And they went through from nation to nation,
    And from one kingdom to another people.
15 He suffered no man to do them wrong;
    Yea, He reproved kings for their sakes, [saying],
    "Touch not Mine anointed,
    And do My prophets no harm."
16 Moreover, He called for a famine upon the land;
    He brake the whole staff of bread.
17 He sent a man before them, [even] Joseph,
18 Who was sold for a servant:
    They afflicted his feet with fetters;
    His soul passed into iron.
19 Until his word came [to pass];
20 The oracle of the Lord purged him.
21 The king sent and loosed him;
    The ruler of the peoples, and let him go.
22 He made him lord of his house,
    And ruler of all his possession;
23 To instruct his princes even as himself,
    And to teach his elders wisdom.
24 Then Israel came into Egypt,
    And Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
25 And He increased His people greatly,
    And made them stronger than their enemies.
26 He turned their heart to hate His people,
    To deal subtly with His servants.
27 He sent Moses His servant,
    And Aaron whom He had chosen him.
28 He put among them the words of His signs
    And His wonders in the land of Ham.
29 He sent darkness, and made it dark;
    And they rebelled not against His words.
    He turned their waters into blood,
    And slew their fish.
30 Their land brought forth frogs,
    Even in the chambers of their kings.
    He spake, and there came dog-flies,
    And gnats in all their borders.
31 He gave them hail for rain,
    And consuming fire in their land.
33 He smote their vines also and their fig trees,
    And brake every tree of their borders.
34 He spake, and the locusts came,
35 And the locust grubs, and that without number;
    And did eat up every herb in their land,
    And devoured all the fruit of their ground.
36 He smote also all the firstborn in their land,
    The first-fruits of all their labour;
37 And brought them forth also with silver and gold;
    And there was not one feeble person among their tribes.
38 Egypt was glad at their departing;
    For the fear of them fell upon them.
39 He spread a cloud for a covering,
    And fire to give them light in the night.
40 They asked, and He brought quails,
    And satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
41 He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out;
