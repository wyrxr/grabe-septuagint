**ΨΑΛΜ. ΟΔ´. LXXIV.**

11 Ἰακώβ· καὶ πάντα τὰ κέρατα τῶν ἁμαρτωλῶν συγκλάσω, καὶ ὑψωθήσεται τὰ κέρατα τοῦ δικαίου.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ΟΕ´. LXXV.**

1 ΕΙΣ τὸ τέλος, ἐν ὕμνοις ψαλμὸς τῷ Ἀσάφ, ᾠδὴ πρὸς τὸν
2 Ἀσσύριον. Γνωστὸς ἐν τῇ Ἰουδαίᾳ ὁ Θεός· ἐν τῷ Ἰσραὴλ μέγα
3 τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐν εἰρήνῃ ὁ τόπος αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὸ
4 κατοικητήριον αὐτοῦ ἐν Σιών· ἐκεῖ συνέτριψε τὰ κράτη τῶν τό-
5 ξων, ὅπλον καὶ ῥομφαίαν καὶ πόλεμον. Διάψαλμα. Φωτίζεις σὺ
6 θαυμαστῶς ἀπὸ ὀρέων αἰωνίων. Ἐταράχθησαν πάντες οἱ ἀσύνε-
7 τοι τῇ καρδίᾳ· ὕπνωσαν ὕπνον αὐτῶν, καὶ οὐχ εὗρον οὐδὲν πάν-
8 τες οἱ ἄνδρες τοῦ πλούτου ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτῶν. Ἀπὸ ἐπιτιμήσεώς
9 σου, ὁ Θεὸς Ἰακώβ, ἐνύσταξαν οἱ ἐπιβεβηκότες τοὺς ἵππους. Σὺ
10 φοβερὸς εἶ, καὶ τίς ἀντιστήσεταί σοι, ἀπὸ τότε ἡ ὀργή σου; Ἐκ
11 τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ἠκούτισας κρίσιν, γῆ ἐφοβήθη καὶ ἡσύχασεν· ἐν τῷ
ἀναστῆναι εἰς κρίσιν τὸν Θεόν, τοῦ σῶσαι πάντας τοὺς πραεῖς τῆς
12 γῆς. Διάψαλμα. Ὅτι ἐνθύμιον ἀνθρώπου ἐξομολογήσεταί σοι· καὶ
13 ἐγκατάλειμμα ἐνθυμίου ἑορτάσει σοι. Εὔξασθε καὶ ἀπόδοτε Κυ-
14 ρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ ἡμῶν· πάντες οἱ κύκλῳ αὐτοῦ οἴσουσι δῶρα τῷ φο-
βερῷ καὶ ἀφαιρουμένῳ πνεῦμα ἀρχόντων, φοβερῷ παρὰ τοῖς βα-
15 σιλεῦσι τῆς γῆς.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ΟΖ´. LXXVI.**

1.2 ΕΙΣ τὸ τέλος, ὑπὲρ Ἰδιθούν, Ψαλμὸς τῷ Ἀσάφ. Φωνῇ μου
πρὸς Κύριον ἐκέκραξα, (καὶ) τῇ φωνῇ μου πρὸς τὸν Θεόν, καὶ προσ-
3 ἔσχε μοι. Ἐν ἡμέρᾳ θλίψεώς μου τὸν Θεὸν ἐξεζήτησα· ταῖς χερ-
4 σί μου νυκτὸς ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐχ ἡπατήθην. Ἀπηνύστατο πα-
5 ρακληθῆναι ἡ ψυχή μου· ἐμνήσθην τοῦ Θεοῦ καὶ εὐφράνθην. Ἤδο-
6 λέσχησα, καὶ ὠλιγοψύχησε τὸ πνεῦμά μου. Διάψαλμα. Προκα-
7 τελάβοντο φυλακὰς οἱ ὀφθαλμοί μου· ἐταράχθην καὶ οὐκ ἐλάλησα.
8.9 Διελογισάμην ἡμέρας ἀρχαίας, καὶ ἔτη αἰώνια ἐμνήσθην, καὶ ἐμε-
10 λέτησα· νυκτὸς μετὰ τῆς καρδίας μου ἠδολέσχουν, καὶ ἔσκαλλον
11 τὸ πνεῦμά μου· μὴ εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας ἀπώσεται Κύριος; καὶ οὐ
12 προσθήσει τοῦ εὐδοκῆσαι ἔτι; Ἤ εἰς τέλος ἀποκόψει τὸ ἔλεος

**PSALM LXXIV.**

11 Jacob; and all the horns of the wicked will I shatter,
And the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.

**PSALM LXXV.**

Unto the End. In Hymns. A Psalm of Asaph, a Song against the Assyrian.

2 God is known in Judah;
His Name is great in Israel.
3 And His dwelling-place was established in peace,
And His habitation in Zion;
4-5 There He brake the might of the bows,
The weapon and the sword and the war. Selah.
5-6 Thou shinest wondrously from the everlasting mountains.
6-8 All the foolish of heart were troubled;
They slumbered their sleep,
And all the men of wealth found nothing in their hands.
8-9 At Thy rebuke, O God of Jacob,
They that rode upon horses were cast into a deep sleep.
9-10 Thou art terrible; and who shall stand before Thee,
When Thy wrath is [made manifest]?
10-11 From heaven hast Thou caused judgment to be heard;
The earth did fear, and was still.
11-12 When God did arise for judgment,
To save all the meek of the earth. Selah.
12-13 For the thought of man shall confess unto Thee;
And the remnant of [his] thought shall keep festival unto Thee.
13-15 Make your vows and pay them unto the Lord our God;
All that be round about Him shall bring gifts
Unto Him that is to be feared, and to Him that doth take away
The spirit of princes; terrible is He unto the kings of the earth.

**PSALM LXXVI.**

Unto the End, for Idithoun. A Psalm of Asaph.

1-3 With my voice cried I unto the Lord;
(And) with my voice unto God, and He gave ear unto me.
3-4 In the day of my trouble I sought God;
My hands [were stretched forth] by night before Him,
And I was not disappointed.
4-5 My soul refused to be comforted;
I remembered God, and was made glad.
5-6 I mused, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.
6-7 Mine eyes did anticipate the night watches;
I was troubled, and spake not.
8-10 I pondered the days of old,
And remembered the years of ages past, and I did meditate;
By night I communed with my heart,
And I searched my spirit;
11 "Will the Lord cast off forever?
And will He be no more pleased to show favor?
12 Or will He cut off His mercy forever?"
