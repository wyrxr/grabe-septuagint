1112                                    ΕΚΚΛΗΣΙΑΣΤΗΣ.             ΚΕΦ. Ηʹ. Θʹ.

10 ποίημα, ὃ πεποίηται ὑπὸ τὸν ἥλιον, τὰ ὅσα ἐξουσιάζεται ὁ ἄνθρωπος ἐν ἀνθρώπῳ τοῦ κακῶσαι αὐτόν· καὶ τότε ἴδον ἀσεβεῖς εἰς τάφους εἰσαχθέντας, καὶ ἐκ τοῦ ἁγίου καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν, καὶ ἐπηνέθησαν ἐν τῇ πόλει, ὅτι οὕτως ἐποίησαν· καί γε τοῦτο ματαιότης.
11 Ὅτι οὐκ ἔστι γινομένη ἀντίζησις ἀπὸ τῶν ποιούντων τὸ πονηρόν ταχύ· διὰ τοῦτο ἐπληροφορήθη καρδία υἱῶν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ἐν αὐτοῖς, τοῦ ποιῆσαι τὸ πονηρόν.
12 Ὅς ἥμαρτεν ἐποίησε τὸ πονηρὸν ἀπὸ τότε, καὶ ἀπὸ μακρότητος αὐτῷ· ὅτι καί γε γινώσκω ἐγὼ ὅτι ἔσται ἀγαθὸν τοῖς φοβουμένοις τὸν Θεόν, ὅπως φοβῶνται ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ·
13 καὶ ἀγαθὸν οὐκ ἔσται τῷ ἀσεβεῖ, καὶ οὐ μακρυνεῖ ἡμέρας ἐν σκιᾷ, ὃς οὐκ ἔστι φοβούμενος ἀπὸ προσώπου τοῦ Θεοῦ.
14 Ἔστι ματαιότης ἡ πεποίηται ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς· ὅτι εἰσὶ δίκαιοι ὅτι φθάνει πρὸς αὐτοὺς ὡς ποίημα τῶν ἀσεβῶν, καὶ εἰσὶν ἀσεβεῖς ὅτι φθάνει πρὸς αὐτοὺς ὡς ποίημα τῶν δικαίων· εἶπα, ὅτι καί γε τοῦτο ματαιότης.
15 Καὶ ἐπήνεσα ἐγὼ σὺν τὴν εὐφροσύνην, ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν ἀγαθὸν τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ ὑπὸ τὸν ἥλιον, ὅτι εἰ μὴ τοῦ φαγεῖν καὶ τοῦ πιεῖν καὶ τοῦ εὐφρανθῆναι· καὶ αὐτὸ συμπροσέσται αὐτῷ ἐν μόχθῳ αὐτοῦ ἡμέρας ζωῆς αὐτοῦ, ἃς ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ ὁ Θεὸς ὑπὸ τὸν ἥλιον.
16 Ἐν οἷς ἔδωκα τὴν καρδίαν μου τοῦ γνῶναι τὴν σοφίαν, καὶ τοῦ ἰδεῖν τὸν περισπασμὸν τὸν πεποιημένον ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς· ὅτι καὶ ἐν ἡμέρᾳ καὶ ἐν νυκτὶ ὕπνον ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἔστι βλέπων·
17 καὶ ἴδον σὺν πάντα τὰ ποιήματα τοῦ Θεοῦ, ὅτι οὐ δυνήσεται ἄνθρωπος τοῦ εὑρεῖν σὺν τὸ ποίημα τὸ πεποιημένον ὑπὸ τὸν ἥλιον· ὅσα ἐὰν μοχθήσῃ ἄνθρωπος τοῦ ζητῆσαι, καὶ οὐχ εὑρήσει· καί γε ὅσα ἂν εἴπῃ ὁ σοφὸς τοῦ γνῶναι, οὐ δυνήσεται τοῦ εὑρεῖν.

ΚΕΦ. Θʹ. ΙΧ.

1 ῞ΟΤΙ σὺν πᾶν τοῦτο ἔδωκα εἰς τὴν καρδίαν μου, καὶ καρδία μου σὺν πᾶν ἴδε τοῦτο· ὅτι οἱ δίκαιοι καὶ οἱ σοφοὶ καὶ αἱ ἐργασίαι αὐτῶν ἐν χειρὶ τοῦ Θεοῦ, καί γε ἀγάπην καί γε μῖσος οὐκ ἔστιν εἰδὼς ὁ ἄνθρωπος· τὰ πάντα πρὸ προσώπου αὐτῶν, ματαιότης ἐν τοῖς πᾶσι.
2 Συνάντημα ἐν τῷ δικαίῳ καὶ τῷ ἀσεβεῖ, τῷ ἀγαθῷ καὶ τῷ κακῷ, καὶ τῷ καθαρῷ καὶ τῷ ἀκαθάρτῳ, καὶ τῷ θυσιάζοντι καὶ τῷ μὴ θυσιάζοντι· ὡς ὁ ἀγαθὸς ὡς ὁ ἁμαρτάνων, ὡς ὁ ὀμνύων καθὼς ὁ τὸν ὅρκον φοβούμενος.
3 Τοῦτο τὸ πονηρὸν ἐν παντὶ πεποιημένῳ ὑπὸ τὸν ἥλιον, ὅτι συνάντημα ἐν τοῖς πᾶσι· καί γε καρδία υἱῶν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ἐπληρώθη πονηροῦ, καὶ περιφέρεια ἐν καρδίᾳ αὐτῶν ἐν ζωῇ αὐτῶν, καὶ ὀπίσω αὐτῶν πρὸς τοὺς νεκρούς.

**CHAPTER 8**

**10** ...[unto] every work which is done under the sun,
    even all wherein man hath authority over man, to harm him.
    And then saw I the ungodly brought into graves;
    and from the holy [place], and they departed,
    and were praised in the city, for that they did so.
    And verily, this also is vanity.
**11** Because there is not a swift retribution upon those who do evil,
    therefore is the heart of the sons of men made bold within them to do evil.
**12** Whoso hath sinned, he hath done evil from that time,
    and for a long duration unto him;
    for verily, I know that it shall be well with them that fear God,
    because they fear from before His countenance.
**13** But it shall not be well with the ungodly,
    neither shall he prolong his days in shadow,
    even he who feareth not from before the face of God.
**14** There is a vanity which hath been made upon the earth,
    that there are righteous men, that it befalls them as the work of the wicked;
    and there are wicked men, that it befalls them as the work of the righteous.
    I said, that verily, this also is vanity.
**15** And I praised the joy, for there is nothing good for a man under the sun,
    save only to eat and to drink and to be joyful;
    and this itself shall attend him in his toil all the days of his life,
    which God hath given him under the sun.
**16** In [all] these things have I given my heart to know wisdom,
    and to behold the travail that is done upon the earth;
    for neither in day nor in night doth one see sleep in his eyes.
**17** And I saw all the works of God,
    that man cannot find the work that is done under the sun.
    However much a man may toil to seek, he shall not find it;
    and however much the wise man may say that he knows,
    he shall not be able to find [it].

**CHAPTER 9**

**1** For all this have I taken to my heart,
    and my heart, with all this, hath seen this:
    that the righteous and the wise and their works are in the hand of God;
    and verily, man knoweth neither love nor hatred.
    All things are before their face; vanity is in all.
**2** The same lot befalls the righteous and the wicked,
    the good and the evil, the clean and the unclean,
    and him that sacrificeth and him that sacrificeth not.
    As the good, so the sinner;
    as he that sweareth, so he that feareth the oath.
**3** This is the evil in all that is done under the sun:
    that the same lot befalls all;
    and verily, the heart of the sons of men is filled with evil,
    and madness is in their heart during their life,
    and after them, [they go] unto the dead.
