**8** Σὺ δὲ Ἰσραήλ, παῖς μου, Ἰακώβ, ὃν ἐξελεξάμην, σπέρμα Ἀβραάμ, ὃν
**9** ἠγάπησα, οὗ ἀντελαβόμην ἀπ᾿ ἄκρων τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἐκ τῶν σκοπιῶν αὐτῆς ἐκάλεσά σε, καὶ εἶπά σοι, παῖς μου εἶ, ἐξελεξάμην σε, καὶ οὐκ ἐγκατέλιπόν σε,
**10** μὴ φοβοῦ, μετὰ σοῦ γάρ εἰμι, μὴ πλανῶ· ἐγὼ γάρ εἰμι ὁ Θεός σου, ὁ ἐνισχύσας σε καὶ ἐβοήθησά σοι, καὶ ἠσφαλισάμην σε τῇ δεξιᾷ τῇ δικαίᾳ μου.
**11** Ἰδοὺ αἰσχυνθήσονται καὶ ἐντραπήσονται πάντες οἱ ἀντικείμενοί σοι, ἔσονται γὰρ ὡς οὐκ ὄντες, καὶ ἀπολοῦνται πάντες οἱ ἀντίδικοί σου.
**12** Ζητήσεις αὐτούς, καὶ οὐ μὴ εὕρῃς τοὺς ἀνθρώπους, οἳ παροινήσουσιν εἰς σέ· ἔσονται γὰρ ὡς οὐκ ὄντες καὶ οὐκ ἔσονται οἱ ἀντιπολεμοῦντές σε·
**13** ὅτι ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου, ὁ κρατῶν τῆς δεξιᾶς σου, ὁ λέγων σοι· μὴ φοβοῦ, ἐγὼ ἐβοήθησά σοι·
**14** μὴ φοβοῦ σκώληξ Ἰακώβ, ἐλιγοστὸς Ἰσραήλ, ἐγὼ ἐβοήθησά σοι, λέγει ὁ Θεός, ὁ λυτρούμενός σε ἅγιος Ἰσραήλ.
**15** Ἰδοὺ ἐποίησά σε ὡς τροχοὺς ἁμάξης ἀλοῶντας καινοὺς πριστοειδεῖς, καὶ ἀλοήσεις ὄρη, καὶ λεπτυνεῖς βουνούς, καὶ ὡς χνοῦν θήσεις,
**16** καὶ λικμήσεις, καὶ ἄνεμος λήψεται αὐτούς, καὶ καταιγὶς διασπερεῖ αὐτούς· σὺ δὲ εὐφρανθήσῃ ἐν Κυρίῳ, ἐν τοῖς ἁγίοις Ἰσραήλ,
**17** καὶ ἀγαλλιάσονται οἱ πτωχοὶ καὶ οἱ ἐνδεεῖς· ζητήσουσι γὰρ ὕδωρ, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται, ἡ γλῶσσα αὐτῶν ἀπὸ τῆς δίψης ἐξηράνθη· ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ Θεός, ἐγὼ ἐπακούσομαι αὐτῶν, ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ οὐκ ἐγκαταλείψω αὐτούς,
**18** ἀλλὰ ἀνοίξω ἐπὶ τῶν ὀρέων ποταμούς, καὶ ἐν μέσῳ πεδίων πηγάς· ποιήσω τὴν ἔρημον εἰς ἕλη ὑδάτων, καὶ τὴν διψῶσαν γῆν ἐν ὑδραγωγοῖς.
**19** Θήσω εἰς τὴν ἄνυδρον γῆν, κέδρον καὶ πύξον, καὶ μυρσίνην καὶ κυπάρισσον, καὶ λεύκην, καὶ θήσω ἐν τῇ Ἀραβὰ Βραδυδάκὰρ καὶ Θασοὺρ ἅμα.
**20** Ἵνα ἴδωσι καὶ γνῶσι, καὶ ἐννοηθῶσι καὶ ἐπιστῶνται ἅμα, ὅτι χεὶρ Κυρίου ἐποίησε ταῦτα πάντα, καὶ ὁ ἅγιος τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ κατέδειξεν αὐτά.
**21** Ἐγγίζει ἡ κρίσις ὑμῶν, λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεός· ἤγγισαν αἱ βουλαὶ ὑμῶν, λέγει ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἰακώβ.
**22** Ἐγγισάτωσαν, καὶ ἀναγγειλάτωσαν ὑμῖν ἃ συμβήσεται, ἃ τὰ πρότερα τίνα ἦν, εἴπατε, καὶ ἐπιστήσομεν τὸν νοῦν, καὶ γνωσόμεθα τί τὰ ἔσχατα καὶ τὰ ἐπερχόμενα·
**23** εἴπατε ἡμῖν, ἀναγγείλατε τὰ ἐπερχόμενα ἐπ᾿ ἐσχάτου, καὶ γνωσόμεθα, ὅτι Θεοί ἐστε· εὐποιήσατε καὶ κακώσατε, καὶ θαυμασόμεθα, καὶ
**24** ὀψόμεθα ἅμα, ὅτι πόθεν ἐστὲ ὑμεῖς, καὶ πόθεν ἡ ἐργασία ὑμῶν,

#### Chapter 41

**8** But thou, O Israel, My servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen,
    thou seed of Abraham, My beloved;
**9** from whom I have taken hold, from the ends of the earth,
    and from the heights thereof have I called thee;
    and said unto thee: "Thou art My servant; I have chosen thee,
    and have not forsaken thee."
**10** Fear not, for I am with thee; be not led astray;
    for I am thy God, who have strengthened thee and helped thee,
    and secured thee with My righteous right hand.
**11** Behold, they shall be ashamed and put to confusion,
    all they that set themselves against thee;
    for they shall be as naught, and all thine adversaries shall perish.
**12** Thou shalt seek them, but shalt not find the men
    who have assailed thee with insolence;
    for they shall be as naught, and those who contend against thee shall be no more.
**13** For I, the Lord thy God, am He that holdeth thy right hand,
    saying unto thee: "Fear not, I have helped thee."
**14** Fear not, thou worm Jacob, thou insignificant Israel;
    I have helped thee, saith the Lord God,
    thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.
**15** Behold, I have made thee as new threshing wheels of a wagon, with sharp teeth;
    and thou shalt thresh the mountains, and make the hills fine,
    and shalt make them as chaff.
**16** And thou shalt winnow them, and the wind shall carry them away,
    and a tempest shall scatter them;
    but thou shalt rejoice in the Lord, in the Holy One of Israel.
**17** And the poor and the needy shall rejoice;
    for they shall seek water, and there shall be none,
    their tongue is parched from thirst;
    I, the Lord God, I shall hear them, the God of Israel,
    and I shall not forsake them.
**18** But I will open rivers upon the mountains, and springs in the midst of the plains;
    I will make the wilderness into pools of water,
    and the thirsty land into waterways.
**19** I will place in the dry land the cedar and the box tree,
    and the myrtle and the cypress, and the poplar;
    and I will set in the Arabah [desert] the Brady Dakar and the Thasour together.
**20** That they may see and know, and consider and understand together,
    that the hand of the Lord hath wrought all these things,
    and the Holy One of Israel hath made them manifest.
**21** Bring forth your cause, saith the Lord God;
    bring near your counsels, saith the King of Jacob.
**22** Let them draw near, and let them declare unto you what shall come to pass;
    what were the former things, tell ye,
    that we may apply our minds, and know what shall be the latter things
    and those which are to come.
**23** Declare unto us the things that shall come to pass in the end,
    that we may know that ye are gods;
    do good, or do evil, that we may be astonished, and
**24** we may see together, whence ye are, and whence your work [comes].
