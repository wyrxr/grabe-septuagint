ΕΚΚΛΗΣΙΑΣΤΗΣ.

ΚΕΦΑΛΑΙΟΝ Α΄. Ι.

**1** ῬΗΜΑΤΑ ἐκκλησιαστοῦ υἱοῦ Δαυΐδ βασιλέως Ἰσραὴλ ἐν
    Ἱερουσαλήμ.
**2** Ματαιότης ματαιοτήτων, εἶπεν ὁ ἐκκλησιαστής· ματαιότης
    ματαιοτήτων, τὰ πάντα ματαιότης.
**3** Τίς περίσσεια τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ ἐν παντὶ μόχθῳ αὐτοῦ ᾧ μοχθεῖ
    ὑπὸ τὸν ἥλιον;
**4** Γενεὰ πορεύεται καὶ γενεὰ ἔρχεται, καὶ ἡ γῆ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα
    ἔστηκε.
**5** Καὶ ἀνατέλλει ὁ ἥλιος, καὶ δύνει ὁ ἥλιος, καὶ εἰς τὸν τόπον αὑτοῦ
    ἕλκει· ἀνατέλλων αὐτὸς ἐκεῖ,
**6** πορεύεται πρὸς νότον, καὶ κυκλοῖ πρὸς βορρᾶν· κυκλοῖ κυκλῶν
    πορεύεται τὸ πνεῦμα, καὶ ἐπὶ κύκλους αὑτοῦ ἐπιστρέφει τὸ πνεῦμα.
**7** Πάντες οἱ χείμαρροι πορεύονται εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν, καὶ ἡ θάλασσα
    οὐκ ἔστιν ἐμπιπλαμένη· εἰς τόπον οὗ οἱ χείμαρροι πορεύονται,
    ἐκεῖ αὐτοὶ ἐπιστρέφουσι τοῦ πορευθῆναι.
**8** Πάντες οἱ λόγοι ἔγκοποι, οὐ δυνήσεται ἀνὴρ τοῦ λαλεῖν· καὶ
    οὐκ ἐμπλησθήσεται ὀφθαλμὸς τοῦ ὁρᾶν, καὶ οὐ πληρωθήσεται οὖς
    ἀπὸ ἀκροάσεως.
**9** Τί τὸ γεγονός; αὐτὸ τὸ γενησόμενον· καὶ τί τὸ πεποιημένον;
    αὐτὸ τὸ ποιηθησόμενον· καὶ οὐκ ἔστι πᾶν πρόσφατον ὑπὸ τὸν ἥλιον.
**10** Ὃς λαλήσει καὶ ἐρεῖ· Ἴδε τοῦτο καινόν ἐστιν; ἤδη γέγονεν ἐν
    τοῖς αἰῶσι τοῖς γενομένοις ἀπὸ ἔμπροσθεν ἡμῶν.
**11** Οὐκ ἔστι μνήμη τοῖς πρώτοις, καὶ γε τοῖς ἐσχάτοις γενησομένοις
    οὐκ ἔσται αὐτοῖς μνήμη μετὰ τῶν γενηθησομένων εἰς τὴν ἐσχάτην.
**12** Ἐγὼ ἐκκλησιαστὴς ἐγενόμην βασιλεὺς ἐπὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ·
**13** καὶ ἔδωκα τὴν καρδίαν μου τοῦ ἐκζητῆσαι καὶ τοῦ κατασκέψασθαι
    ἐν τῇ σοφίᾳ περὶ πάντων τῶν γενομένων ὑπὸ τὸν οὐρανόν· ὅτι
    περισπασμὸν πονηρὸν ἔδωκεν ὁ Θεὸς τοῖς υἱοῖς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου,
    τοῦ περισπᾶσθαι ἐν αὐτῷ.
**14** Ἴδον σὺν πάντα τὰ ποιήματα τὰ πεποιημένα ὑπὸ τὸν ἥλιον·
    καὶ ἰδοὺ τὰ πάντα ματαιότης καὶ προαίρεσις πνεύματος.
**15** Διεστραμμένον οὐ δυνήσεται τοῦ κοσμηθῆναι, καὶ ὑστέρημα
    οὐ δυνήσεται τοῦ ἀριθμηθῆναι.
**16** Ἐλάλησα ἐγὼ ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ μου τῷ λέγειν· ἐγὼ ἰδοὺ ἐμεγαλύνθην,
    καὶ προσέθηκα σοφίαν ἐπὶ πᾶσιν οἱ ἐγένοντο ἔμπροσθέν μου ἐν
    Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ καρδία

**ECCLESIASTES**

**CHAPTER 1**

**1** The words of the Preacher, the son of David,
    king of Israel in Jerusalem.
**2** Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher;
    vanity of vanities, all is vanity.
**3** What profit hath a man of all his labour
    wherein he laboureth under the sun?
**4** One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh;
    but the earth abideth for ever.
**5** The sun also riseth, and the sun goeth down,
    and hasteth to his place where he ariseth.
**6** It goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north;
    it whirls about continually, and the wind returneth again according to its circuits.
**7** All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full;
    unto the place whence the rivers come, thither they return again to flow.
**8** All words are wearisome; a man cannot utter them.
    The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.
**9** What hath been? That which shall be.
    And what hath been done? That which shall be done.
    And there is no new thing under the sun.
**10** Should one speak and say, "Behold, this is new"?
    It hath been already in the ages which were before us.
**11** There is no remembrance of the former [things];
    and indeed, for the latter [things] which shall be,
    there shall be no remembrance of them,
    even among those that shall be brought forth in the last generation.
**12** I, the Preacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem.
**13** And I gave my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom
    concerning all things that are done under heaven;
    for God hath given a grievous toil to the sons of men,
    to be vexed therewith.
**14** I have seen along with all the works that are done under the sun;
    and, behold, all is vanity and a striving after wind.
**15** That which is crooked cannot be made straight,
    and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.
**16** I communed with my heart, saying:
    "Behold, I am become great, and have increased wisdom
    above all them who were before me in Jerusalem"; and my heart...
