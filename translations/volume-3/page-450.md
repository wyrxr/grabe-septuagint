ΚΕΦ. ΛΔ΄. XXXIV.

1.2 ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς με, λέγων· υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου,
προφήτευσον ἐπὶ τοὺς ποιμένας τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, προφήτευσον, καὶ
εἰπὸν αὐτοῖς τοῖς ποιμέσι· τάδε λέγει Κύριος Κύριος· ὦ ποιμένες·
3 Πρόβατα βόσκουσιν οἱ ποιμένες; Ἰδοὺ τὸ γάλα κατεσθίετε, καὶ τὰ
ἔρια περιβάλλεσθε, καὶ τὸ παχὺ ἐσφάζετε, καὶ τὰ πρόβατά μου
4 οὐκ ἐβόσκετε. Τὸ ἠσθενηκὸς οὐκ ἐνισχύσατε, καὶ τὸ κακῶς ἔχον
οὐκ ἐσωματοποιήσατε, καὶ τὸ συντετριμμένον οὐ κατεδήσατε, καὶ
τὸ πλανώμενον οὐκ ἐπεστρέψατε, καὶ τὸ ἀπολωλὸς οὐκ ἐζητή-
5 σατε, καὶ τὸ ἰσχυρὸν κατειργάσασθε μόχθῳ. Καὶ διεσπάρησαν
τὰ πρόβατά μου, διὰ τὸ μὴ εἶναι ποιμένας, καὶ ἐγενήθησαν εἰς
κατάβρωμα πᾶσι τοῖς θηρίοις τοῦ ἀγροῦ, καὶ τοῖς πετεινοῖς τοῦ
6 οὐρανοῦ. Καὶ διεσπάρησαν τὰ πρόβατά μου ἐν παντὶ ὄρει, καὶ
ἐπὶ πάντα βουνὸν ὑψηλὸν, καὶ ἐπὶ παντὶ προσώπῳ πάσης τῆς
γῆς διεσπάρη τὰ πρόβατά μου, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ ἐκζητῶν οὐδὲ ὁ ἀπο-
7.8 στρέφων. Διὰ τοῦτο, ποιμένες, ἀκούσατε λόγον Κυρίου. Ζῶ ἐγὼ,
λέγει Κύριος Κύριος, εἰ μὴν ἀντὶ τοῦ γενέσθαι τὰ πρόβατά μου
εἰς προνομήν, καὶ γενέσθαι τὰ πρόβατά μου εἰς κατάβρωμα πᾶσι
τοῖς θηρίοις τοῦ ἀγροῦ, παρὰ τὸ μὴ εἶναι ποιμένας, καὶ οὐκ ἐ-
9 ἐζήτησαν τὰ πρόβατά μου οἱ ποιμένες, καὶ ἐβόσκησαν οἱ ποι-
μένες ἑαυτοὺς, τὰ δὲ πρόβατά μου οὐκ ἐβόσκησαν. Ἀντὶ τούτου,
10 ποιμένες, ἀκούσατε λόγον Κυρίου· τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναὶ Κύριος·
Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐπὶ τοὺς ποιμένας, καὶ ἐκζητήσω τὰ πρόβατά μου ἐκ
τῶν χειρῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἀποστρέψω αὐτοὺς τοῦ μὴ ποιμαίνειν τὰ
πρόβατά μου, καὶ οὐ μὴ βοσκήσουσιν ἔτι οἱ ποιμένες αὐτά· καὶ
ἐξελοῦμαι τὰ πρόβατά μου ἐκ τοῦ στόματος αὐτῶν, καὶ οὐκ ἔτι
11 ἔσονται αὐτοῖς εἰς κατάβρωμα. Διότι τάδε λέγει Κύριος Κύριος
ὁ Θεός· Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ εἰμι, ἐκζητήσω τὰ πρόβατά μου, καὶ ἐπισκέ-
12 ψομαι αὐτά. Ὡς ἐπισκέπτεται ὁ ποιμὴν τὸ ποίμνιον αὐτοῦ ἐν
ἡμέρᾳ, ὅτ’ ἂν ᾖ γνόφος καὶ νεφέλη ἐν μέσῳ προβάτων αὐτοῦ δια-
κεχωρισμένων, οὕτως ἐκζητήσω τὰ πρόβατά μου, καὶ ἀπελάσω
αὐτὰ ἀπὸ παντὸς τόπου, οὗ διεσπάρησαν ἐκεῖ ἐν ἡμέρᾳ νεφέλης
13 καὶ γνόφου. Καὶ ἐξάξω αὐτοὺς ἐκ τῶν ἐθνῶν, καὶ συνάξω αὐ-

**Chapter 34**

1 And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
2 "Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say unto them, even unto the shepherds: Thus saith the Lord, the Lord:
3 O shepherds! Is it sheep that shepherds feed? Behold, ye devour the milk, and yourselves ye clothe with the wool, and the fat [ones] do ye slaughter, but My sheep ye have not fed.
4 The weak have ye not strengthened, nor made sound that which was sick, nor have ye bound up that which was broken, nor turned back that which had strayed, nor sought that which was lost; but the strong have ye oppressed with grievous toil.
5 And My sheep were scattered, forasmuch as there were no shepherds; and they became [a prey and] food for all the beasts of the field, and for the fowls of the heaven.
6 And My sheep were scattered over every mountain and upon every high hill; and upon all the face of the whole earth were My sheep scattered, and there was none that did seek them, nor any that did turn them back.
7 Therefore, O shepherds, hear ye the word of the Lord!
8 As I live, saith the Lord, the Lord, surely, forasmuch as My sheep became a prey, and My sheep became food for all the beasts of the field, because there were no shepherds, and My shepherds sought not My sheep, but the shepherds fed themselves, and My sheep they fed not;
10 Therefore, O shepherds, hear ye the word of the Lord! Thus saith Adonai the Lord: Behold, I am against the shepherds, and I will require My sheep at their hand, and I will cause them to cease from feeding My sheep; and the shepherds shall no more feed them: yea, I will deliver My sheep from their mouth, and they shall no longer be unto them as food.
11 For thus saith the Lord, the Lord, even God: Behold, I am [He]; I will seek out My sheep, and I will visit them.
12 As a shepherd visiteth his flock in a day when there is gloom and a cloud in the midst of his scattered sheep, so will I seek My sheep, and will drive them out from every place whither they were scattered there, in a day of cloud and gloom.
13 And I will bring them forth out of the nations, and will gather them..."
