τοῖς, ἑκάστῳ βοτάνην ἐν ἀγρῷ. Διότι οἱ ἀποφθεγγόμενοι ἐλά- 2
λησαν κόπους, καὶ οἱ μάντεις δράσεις ψευδεῖς, καὶ τὰ ἐνύπνια
ψευδῆ ἐλάλουν, μάταια παρεκάλουν· διὰ τοῦτο ἐξηράνθησαν ὡς
πρόβατα, καὶ ἐκακώθησαν, ὅτι οὐκ ἦν ἴασις. Ἐπὶ τοὺς ποιμένας 3
παρωξύνθη ὁ θυμός μου, καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀμνοὺς ἐπισκέψομαι· καὶ
ἐπισκέπτεται Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὁ παντοκράτωρ τὸ ποίμνιον αὐτοῦ,
τὸν οἶκον Ἰούδα, καὶ τάξει αὐτοὺς ὡς ἵππον εὐπρεπῆ αὐτοῦ ἐν
πολέμῳ. Καὶ ἐξ αὐτοῦ ἐπέβλεψε, καὶ ἐξ αὐτοῦ ἔταξε, καὶ ἐξ 4
αὐτοῦ τὸ τόξον ἐν θυμῷ· ἐξ αὐτοῦ ἐξελεύσεται πᾶς ὁ ἐλαύνων ἐν
τῷ αὐτῷ. Καὶ ἔσονται ὡς μαχηταὶ πατοῦντες πηλὸν ἐν ταῖς 5
ὁδοῖς ἐν πολέμῳ, καὶ παρατάξονται, διότι Κύριος παντοκράτωρ
μετ᾿ αὐτῶν· καὶ καταισχυνθήσονται ἀναβάται ἵππων. Καὶ κατι- 6
σχύσω τὸν οἶκον Ἰούδα, καὶ τὸν οἶκον Ἰωσὴφ σώσω, καὶ κατοί-
κιῶ αὐτούς, ὅτι ἠγάπηκα αὐτούς, καὶ ἔσονται, ὃν τρόπον οὐκ
ἀπεστρεψάμην αὐτούς· διότι ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπα-
κούσομαι αὐτοῖς. Καὶ ἔσονται ὡς μαχηταὶ τοῦ Ἐφραίμ, καὶ χα- 7
ρήσεται ἡ καρδία αὐτῶν ὡς ἐν οἴνῳ· καὶ τὰ τέκνα αὐτῶν ὄψε-
ται, καὶ εὐφρανθήσεται, καὶ χαρείσεται ἡ αὐτῶν καρδία ἐπὶ τῷ
Κυρίῳ. Σημανῶ αὐτοῖς, καὶ εἰσδέξομαι αὐτούς, διότι λυτρώσο- 8
μαι αὐτούς, καὶ πληθυνθήσονται, καθότι ἦσαν πολλοί· καὶ σπερῶ 9
αὐτοὺς ἐν λαοῖς, καὶ οἱ μακρὰν μνησθήσονταί μου, καὶ ἐκθρέψω
τὰ τέκνα αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπιστρέψουσι. Καὶ ἐπιστρέψω αὐτοὺς ἐκ 10
γῆς Αἰγύπτου, καὶ ἐξ Ἀσσυρίων εἰσδέξομαι αὐτούς, καὶ εἰς τὴν
Γαλααδῖτιν καὶ εἰς τὸν Λίβανον εἰσάξω αὐτούς, καὶ οὐ μὴ ὑπο-
λειφθῇ ἐξ αὐτῶν οὐδὲ εἷς· καὶ διελεύσονται ἐν θαλάσσῃ στενῇ, 11
καὶ πατάξουσιν ἐν θαλάσσῃ κύματα, καὶ ξηρανθήσονται πάντα
τὰ βάθη ποταμῶν, καὶ ἀφαιρεθήσεται πᾶσα ὕβρις Ἀσσυρίων, καὶ
σκῆπτρον Αἰγύπτου περιαιρεθήσεται. Καὶ κατισχύσω αὐτοὺς ἐν 12
Κυρίῳ Θεῷ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι αὐτοῦ κατακαυχήσονται,
λέγει Κύριος.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΑ΄.

ΔΙΑΝΟΙΞΟΝ, ὁ Λίβανος, τὰς θύρας σου, καὶ καταφαγέτω 1
πῦρ τὰς κέδρους σου· ὀλολυξάτω πῖτυς, διότι πέπτωκε κέδρος, 2
ὅτι μεγάλως μεγιστᾶνες ἐταλαιπώρησαν· ὀλολύξατε δρῦες τῆς
Βασανίτιδος, ὅτι κατεσπάσθη ὁ δρυμὸς ὁ σύμφυτος. Φωνὴ θρη- 3
νούντων ποιμένων, ὅτι τεταλαίπωρηκεν ἡ μεγαλωσύνη αὐτῶν·
φωνὴ ὠρυομένων λεόντων, ὅτι τεταλαίπωρηκε τὸ φρύαγμα τοῦ
Ἰορδάνου.

**Zechariah [Chapter] 10**

**2** For the diviners have spoken vanity, and the seers have seen false visions, and have spoken vain dreams; they have comforted in vain. Therefore are they withered as sheep, and are afflicted, because there was no healing.
**3** Upon the shepherds was My wrath kindled, and upon the lambs will I look. And the Lord God Almighty shall look upon His flock, the house of Judah, and He shall set them as His comely horse in battle.
**4** And from him hath He looked [with favour], and from him hath He ordained; and from him [cometh forth] the bow in wrath; from him shall every leader advance in their midst.
**5** And they shall be as warriors treading down the mire in the streets in battle; and they shall array themselves for battle, because the Lord Almighty is with them; and the riders of horses shall be put to shame.
**6** And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph; and I will cause them to dwell [again], for I have loved them, and they shall be even as if I had not cast them off; for I am the Lord their God, and I will hearken unto them.
**7** And they shall be as warriors of Ephraim, and their heart shall rejoice as with wine; and their children shall see [it], and shall be glad, and their heart shall rejoice in the Lord.
**8** I will signal unto them, and I will gather them, for I will redeem them, and they shall be multiplied, even as they were many.
**9** And I will sow them among the peoples, and they that are far off shall remember Me; and I will nourish their children, and they shall return.
**10** And I will bring them back from the land of Egypt, and from the Assyrians will I gather them; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and into Lebanon, and not one of them shall be left behind.
**11** And they shall pass through a narrow sea, and they shall strike the waves in the sea; and all the depths of the rivers shall be dried up, and all the pride of the Assyrians shall be taken away, and the scepter of Egypt shall be taken away.
**12** And I will strengthen them in the Lord their God, and in His name shall they glory, saith the Lord.

**Zechariah [Chapter] 11**

**1** Open thy doors, O Lebanon, and let the fire consume thy cedars.
**2** Wail, O fir tree, for the cedar is fallen, because the magnates have been greatly distressed. Wail, O ye oaks of Bashan, for the dense forest is cast down.
**3** A voice of lamenting shepherds, for their glory is distressed; a voice of roaring lions, for the pride of the Jordan is distressed.
