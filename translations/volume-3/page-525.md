**ΚΕΦ. Θ΄. Ι΄.**
ὁ πνευματοφόρος· ὑπὸ τοῦ πλήθους τῶν ἀδικιῶν σου ἐπληθύνθη μανία σου. Σκοπὸς Ἐφραὶμ μετὰ Θεοῦ, προφήτης παγὶς σκολιὰ
ἐπὶ πάσας τὰς ὁδοὺς αὐτοῦ· μανίαν ἐν οἴκῳ Θεοῦ κατέπηξαν.
Ἐφθάρησαν κατὰ τὰς ἡμέρας τοῦ βουνοῦ· μνησθήσεται ἀδικίας
αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐκδικήσει ἁμαρτίας αὐτῶν. Ὡς σταφυλὴν ἐν ἐρήμῳ
εὗρον τὸν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ὡς σκοπὸν ἐν συκῇ πρώϊμον εἶδον πατέρας
αὐτῶν· αὐτοὶ εἰσῆλθον πρὸς τὸν Βεελφεγώρ, καὶ ἀπηλλοτριώθη-
σαν εἰς αἰσχύνην, καὶ ἐγένοντο οἱ ἐδελυγμένοι, ὡς ἠγαπημένοι.
Ἐφραὶμ ὡς ὄρνεον ἐξεπετάσθη· αἱ δόξαι αὐτῶν ἐκ τόκων καὶ
ὠδίνων καὶ συλλήψεων. Διότι καὶ ἐὰν ἐκθρέψωσι τὰ τέκνα αὐτῶν,
ἀτεκνωθήσονται ἐξ ἀνθρώπων· διότι καὶ οὐαὶ αὐτοῖς ἐστι, σάρξ
μου ἐξ αὐτῶν. Ἐφραίμ, ὃν τρόπον εἶδον, εἰς θήραν παρέστησαν
τὰ τέκνα αὐτῶν, καὶ Ἐφραὶμ τοῦ ἐξαγαγεῖν εἰς ἀποκέντησιν τὰ
τέκνα αὐτοῦ. Δὸς αὐτοῖς Κύριε· τί δώσεις αὐτοῖς; δὸς αὐτοῖς
μήτραν ἀτεκνοῦσαν, καὶ μαστοὺς ξηρούς. Πᾶσαι αἱ κακίαι αὐτῶν
εἰς Γαλγάλ, ὅτι ἐκεῖ αὐτοὺς ἐμίσησα διὰ τὰς κακίας τῶν ἐπιτη-
δευμάτων αὐτῶν· ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου μου ἐκβαλῶ αὐτούς, οὐ μὴ προσ-
θήσω τοῦ ἀγαπῆσαι αὐτούς· πάντες οἱ ἄρχοντες αὐτῶν ἀπει-
θοῦντες. Ἐπόνεσεν Ἐφραίμ· τὰς ῥίζας αὐτοῦ ἐξηράνθη, καρπὸν
οὐκ ἔτι μὴ ἐνέγκῃ· διότι καὶ ἐὰν γεννήσωσιν, ἀποκτενῶ τὰ ἐπι-
θυμήματα κοιλίας αὐτῶν. Ἀπώσεται αὐτοὺς ὁ Θεός, ὅτι οὐκ εἰ-
σήκουσαν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔσονται ὡς πλανῆται ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν.

**ΚΕΦ. Ι΄.**
ΑΜΠΕΛΟΣ εὐκληματοῦσα Ἰσραήλ, ὁ καρπὸς αὐτῆς εὐθηνῶν·
κατὰ τὸ πλῆθος τῶν καρπῶν αὐτοῦ ἐπλήθυνε τὰ θυσιαστήρια, καὶ
κατὰ τὰ ἀγαθὰ τῆς γῆς αὐτοῦ, ᾠκοδόμησε στήλας. Ἐμέρισαν
καρδίας αὐτῶν, νῦν ἀφανισθήσονται· αὐτὸς κατασκάψει τὰ θυσι-
αστήρια αὐτῶν, ταλαιπωρήσουσιν αἱ στῆλαι αὐτῶν. Διότι νῦν
ἐροῦσιν· οὐκ ἔστι βασιλεὺς ἡμῖν, ὅτι οὐκ ἐφοβήθημεν τὸν Κύ-
ριον. Ὁ δὲ βασιλεὺς τί ποιήσει ἡμῖν; λαλῶν ῥήματα προφάσεις
ψευδεῖς, διαθήσεται διαθήκην· ἀνατελεῖ ὡς ἀγρωστις κρίμα ἐπὶ
χέρσον ἀγροῦ. Τῷ μόσχῳ τοῦ οἴκου Ὡν παροικήσουσιν οἱ κα-
τοικοῦντες Σαμάρειαν, ὅτι ἐπένθησεν ὁ λαὸς αὐτοῦ ἐπ᾿ αὐτόν·
καὶ καθὼς παρεπίκραναν αὐτόν, ἐπιχαροῦνται ἐπὶ τὴν δόξαν αὐτοῦ.

**CHAPTER 9**

**7** ...the spirit-bearer; by the multitude of thy iniquities is thy madness multiplied.
**8** Ephraim is a watchman with God, [but] a prophet [is] a crooked snare upon all his ways; they have established madness in the house of God.
**9** They have been corrupted according to the days of the hill. He shall remember their iniquities, and avenge their sins.
**10** As grapes in the wilderness I found Israel, and as a prized early [fruit] upon a fig tree I saw their fathers. But they themselves went in unto Baal-Peor, and were alienated unto shame, and became detestable as [their] beloved [idols].
**11** Ephraim hath flown away like a bird. Their glories [are gone] from births and travail and conceptions.
**12** For even if they rear their children, they shall be made childless from among men; because also woe is unto them, [for] My flesh is from them.
**13** Ephraim, in what manner I saw [them], they have offered their children to the hunter; and Ephraim [is] to bring forth his children to the piercing.
**14** Give them, O Lord; what wilt Thou give them? Give them a womb that maketh childless, and dry breasts.
**15** All their wickedness [is] in Gilgal, for there I hated them because of the wickedness of their practices. Out of My house will I cast them, I will no longer add to love them; all their rulers are disobedient.
**16** Ephraim hath travailed; his roots are dried up, no more shall he bring forth fruit. For even if they beget [children], I will slay the desires of their womb.
**17** God shall cast them away, because they did not hearken unto Him; and they shall be as wanderers among the nations.

**CHAPTER 10**

**1** Israel is a luxuriant vine, whose fruit aboundeth. According to the multitude of his fruits, he hath multiplied altars, and according to the goodness of his land, he hath built pillars.
**2** They have divided their hearts; now shall they be made desolate. He Himself shall dig down their altars, their pillars shall be distressed.
**3** For now shall they say, 'We have no king, because we feared not the Lord. But what shall the king do for us?'
**4** Speaking words, false pretexts, he shall make a covenant. Judgment shall spring up as weeds upon the dry field.
**5** For the calf of the house of On shall the inhabitants of Samaria lament, for his people mourned over it. And as they bitterly provoked it, they shall rejoice over its glory.
