αὐτὸν, τοὺς ποταμοὺς αὐτῆς ἤγαγε κύκλῳ τῶν φυτῶν αὐτοῦ, καὶ
τὰ συστήματα αὐτῆς ἐξαπέστειλεν εἰς πάντα τὰ ξύλα τοῦ πεδίου.
Ἕνεκεν τούτου, ὑψώθη τὸ μέγεθος αὐτοῦ παρὰ πάντα τὰ
ξύλα τοῦ πεδίου, καὶ ἐπλατύνθησαν οἱ κλάδοι αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὑψώ-
θησαν αἱ παραφυάδες αὐτοῦ, ἀφ᾿ ὕδατος πολλοῦ, ἐν τῷ ἐκτεί-
6 νειν αὐτόν. Ἐν ταῖς παραφυάσιν αὐτοῦ ἐνόσσευσαν πάντα τὰ πε-
τεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ ὑποκάτω τῶν κλάδων αὐτοῦ ἐγεννῶσαν
πάντα τὰ θηρία τοῦ πεδίου, ἐν τῇ σκιᾷ αὐτοῦ κατῴκησε πᾶν
7 πλῆθος ἐθνῶν. Καὶ ἐγένετο καλὸς ἐν τῷ ὕψει αὐτοῦ διὰ τὸ πλῆ-
θος τῶν κλάδων αὐτοῦ, ὅτι ἐγενήθησαν αἱ ῥίζαι αὐτοῦ εἰς ὕδωρ
8 πολύ. Κυπάρισσοι τοιαῦται οὐκ ἐγενήθησαν ἐν τῷ παραδείσῳ τοῦ
Θεοῦ, καὶ πίτυες οὐκ ὅμοιαι ταῖς παραφυάσιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐλάται
οὐκ ἐγένοντο ὅμοιαι τοῖς κλάδοις αὐτοῦ· πᾶν ξύλον ἐν τῷ παραδείσῳ
9 τοῦ Θεοῦ οὐχ ὡμοιώθη αὐτῷ ἐν τῷ κάλλει αὐτοῦ, διὰ
τὸ πλῆθος τῶν κλάδων αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐξήλωσαν αὐτὸν τὰ ξύλα τοῦ
10 παραδείσου τῆς τρυφῆς τοῦ Θεοῦ. Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναὶ
Κύριος· ἀνθ᾿ ὧν ἐγένου μέγας τῷ μεγέθει, καὶ ἔδωκας τὴν ἀρχὴν
11 σου εἰς μέσον τῶν νεφελῶν, καὶ εἶδον ἐν τῷ ὑψωθῆναι αὐτὸν, καὶ
παρέδωκα αὐτὸν εἰς χεῖρας ἄρχοντος ἐθνῶν, καὶ ἐποίησε τὴν ἀ-
12 πώλειαν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐξωλέθρευσαν αὐτὸν ἀλλότριοι λοιμοὶ ἀπὸ
ἐθνῶν, καὶ κατέβαλον αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τῶν ὀρέων· ἐν πάσαις ταῖς φά-
ραγξιν ἔπεσον οἱ κλάδοι αὐτοῦ, καὶ συνετετρίβη τὰ στελέχη αὐτοῦ
ἐν παντὶ πεδίῳ τῆς γῆς, καὶ κατέβησαν ἀπὸ τῆς σκέπης αὐτοῦ
13 πάντες οἱ λαοὶ τῶν ἐθνῶν, καὶ ἠδάφισαν αὐτόν. Ἐπὶ τὴν πτῶ-
σιν αὐτοῦ ἀνεπαύσαντο πάντα τὰ πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ ἐπὶ
14 τὰ στελέχη αὐτοῦ ἐγένοντο πάντα τὰ θηρία τοῦ ἀγροῦ, ὅπως μὴ
ὑψωθῶσιν ἐν τῷ μεγέθει αὐτῶν πάντα τὰ ξύλα τὰ ἐν τῷ ὕδατι·
καὶ οὐκ ἔδωκαν τὴν ἀρχὴν αὐτῶν εἰς μέσον νεφελῶν, καὶ οὐκ ἔ-
στησαν ἐν τῷ ὕψει αὐτῶν πρὸς αὐτὰ πάντες οἱ πίνοντες ὕδωρ,
ἀλλὰ πάντες ἐδόθησαν εἰς θάνατον, εἰς γῆν βάθους, ἐν μέσῳ υἱῶν
15 ἀνθρώπων προσκαταβαίνοντας εἰς βόθρον. Τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναὶ Κύ-
ριος· ἐν ᾗ ἡμέρᾳ κατέβη εἰς ἅδου, ἐπένθησεν αὐτὸν ἡ ἄβυσσος·
καὶ ἐκώλυσα τοὺς ποταμοὺς αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐκώλυσε πλῆθος ὕδατος,
καὶ ἐσκότασεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν ὁ Λίβανος, καὶ ἐξελύθησαν ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ
16 πάντα τὰ ξύλα τοῦ πεδίου. Καὶ ἐσείσθησαν ἔθνη ἀπὸ τῆς φωνῆς
τῆς πτώσεως αὐτοῦ, ὅτε κατεβίβαζον αὐτὸν εἰς ἅδου μετὰ τῶν

**Chapter 31**

**4** ...it; its rivers did it lead round about its plants, and its channels did it send forth unto all the trees of the plain.
**5** For this cause, its stature was exalted above all the trees of the plain, and its branches were spread forth, and its boughs were lifted high, by reason of much water, when it stretched itself out.
**6** In its boughs did all the fowls of heaven make their nests, and under its branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth [their young], and in its shade did every multitude of nations dwell.
**7** And it became fair in its height by reason of the multitude of its branches, for its roots were [planted] in much water.
**8** Cypresses such as these were not found in the paradise of God, neither were fir trees like unto its boughs, nor were plane trees like unto its branches;
**9** No tree in the paradise of God was likened unto it in its beauty, by reason of the multitude of its branches. And the trees of the paradise of the delight of God were jealous of it.

**10** Therefore thus saith Adonai the Lord: "Because thou hast become great in stature, and hast set thy crown amidst the clouds, and I have beheld it lifted up,
**11** I have delivered it into the hands of the ruler of the nations; and he hath wrought its utter destruction.
**12** And strangers, [even] plagues from among the nations, did utterly destroy it, and they cast it down upon the mountains. In all the valleys fell its branches, and its trunks were broken in pieces in every plain of the earth. And all the peoples of the nations came down from its shade, and trampled it underfoot.
**13** Upon its fall did all the fowls of heaven rest, and upon its stumps did all the beasts of the field make their abode,
**14** that none of the trees by the waters should exalt themselves in their height, nor give their crown amidst the clouds, nor should they, all that drink water, stand in their height against them; but all were given unto death, unto the land of depth, among the sons of
**15** men that go down into the pit. Thus saith Adonai the Lord: 'In the day when it went down into Hades, the deep mourned for it; and I restrained its rivers, and the abundance of water was withheld; and Lebanon became dark over it, and all the trees of the plain fainted for it.
**16** And nations were shaken at the sound of its fall, when I brought it down into Hades with those..."
