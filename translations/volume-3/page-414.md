**ΙΕΖΕΚΙΗΛ ΚΕΦ. ΙϚ΄.**

**38** Καὶ ἀποκαλύψω τὰς κακίας σου πρὸς αὐτοὺς, καὶ ὄψονται πᾶσαν τὴν αἰσχύνην σου, καὶ ἐκδικήσω σε ἐκδικήσει μοιχαλίδος καὶ ἐκχεούσης αἷμα, καὶ θήσομαί σε ἐν τῷ αἵματί σου, καὶ δώσω σε εἰς αἷμα θυμοῦ καὶ ζήλου.
**39** Καὶ παραδώσω σε εἰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν, καὶ κατασκάψουσι τὸ πορνεῖόν σου, καὶ καθελοῦσι τὴν βάσιν σου, καὶ ἐκδύσουσι σὲ τὰ ἱμάτιά σου, καὶ λήψονται τὰ σκεύη τῆς καυχήσεώς σου·
**40** Καὶ ἀφήσουσι σε γυμνὴν, καὶ ἀσχημωνοῦσαν. Καὶ ἄξουσιν ἐπὶ σὲ ὄχλους, καὶ λιθοβολήσουσι σε ἐν λίθοις, καὶ κατασφάξουσι σε ἐν τοῖς ξίφεσιν αὐτῶν.
**41** Καὶ ἐμπρήσουσι τοὺς οἴκους σου ἐν πυρὶ, καὶ ποιήσουσιν ἐν σοὶ ἐκδικήσεις ἐνώπιον γυναικῶν πολλῶν· καὶ ἀποστρέψω σε ἀπὸ τῆς πορνείας σου, καὶ μισθώματα οὐ μὴ δῷς οὐκέτι,
**42** Καὶ ἐπαφήσω τὸν θυμόν μου ἐπὶ σὲ, καὶ ἐξαρθήσεται ὁ ζῆλός μου ἐκ σοῦ·
**43** Καὶ ἀναπαύσομαι, καὶ οὐ μὴ μεριμνήσω οὐκέτι, ἀνθ᾿ ὧν οὐκ ἐμνήσθης τὴν ἡμέραν τῆς νηπιότητός σου, καὶ ἐλύπεις με ἐν πᾶσι τούτοις· καὶ ἐγὼ ἰδοὺ τὰς ὁδούς σου εἰς κεφαλήν σου δέδωκα, λέγει Ἀδωναΐ Κύριος· καὶ οὕτως ἐποίησας τὴν ἀσέβειάν σου ἐπὶ πάσαις ταῖς ἀνομίαις σου.
**44** Ταῦτά ἐστι πάντα ὅσα εἶπαν κατὰ σοῦ ἐν παραβολῇ, λέγοντες, καθὼς ἡ μήτηρ θυγάτηρ.
**45** Καὶ ἡ θυγάτηρ τῆς μητρός σου σὺ εἶ, ἡ ἀπωσαμένη τὸν ἄνδρα αὐτῆς καὶ τὰ τέκνα αὐτῆς, καὶ αἱ ἀδελφαί σου τῶν ἀδελφῶν αἱ ἀπωσάμεναι τοὺς ἄνδρας αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ τέκνα αὐτῶν· ἡ μήτηρ ὑμῶν Χετταία, καὶ ὁ πατὴρ ὑμῶν Ἀμοῤῥαῖος.
**46** Ἡ ἀδελφή ὑμῶν ἡ πρεσβυτέρα Σαμάρεια αὕτη καὶ αἱ θυγατέρες αὐτῆς, ἡ κατοικοῦσα ἐξ εὐωνύμων σου· καὶ ἡ ἀδελφή σου ἡ νεωτέρα σου, ἡ κατοικοῦσα ἐκ δεξιῶν σου Σόδομα καὶ αἱ θυγατέρες αὐτῆς.
**47** Καὶ οὐδ᾿ ὡς ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὐτῶν ἐπορεύθης, οὐδὲ κατὰ τὰς ἀνομίας αὐτῶν ἐποίησας παρὰ μικρὸν, καὶ ὑπέρκειται αὐτὰς παρὰ μικρὸν ἐν πάσαις ταῖς ὁδοῖς σου.
**48** Ζῶ ἐγὼ, λέγει Ἀδωναΐ Κύριος, εἰ πεποίηκε Σόδομα ἡ ἀδελφή σου αὕτη καὶ αἱ θυγατέρες αὐτῆς, ὃν τρόπον πεποίηκας σὺ καὶ αἱ θυγατέρες σου.
**49** Πλὴν τοῦτο τὸ ἀνόμημα Σοδόμων τῆς ἀδελφῆς σου ὑπερηφανία, ἐν πλησμονῇ ἄρτων καὶ ἐν εὐθηνίᾳ οἴνου ἐσπατάλων αὕτη καὶ αἱ θυγατέρες αὐτῆς· τοῦτο ὑπῆρχεν αὐτῇ καὶ ταῖς θυγατράσιν αὐτῆς·
**50** Καὶ χεῖρα πτωχοῦ καὶ πένητος οὐκ ἀντελάβοντο, καὶ ἐμεγαλαύχουν, καὶ ἐποίησαν ἀνομήματα ἐνώπιον ἐμοῦ, καὶ ἐξῆρα αὐτὰς, καθὼς ἴδον.
**51** Καὶ Σαμάρεια κατὰ τὰς ἡμίσεις τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν σου οὐχ ἥμαρτε· καὶ ἐπλήθυνας τὰς ἀνομίας σου ὑπὲρ αὐτὰς, καὶ ἐδικαίω-

**38** And I will uncover thy wickednesses unto them, and they shall behold all thy shame; and I will execute judgment upon thee with the judgment of an adulteress and of one who sheddeth blood, and I will set thee in thy blood, and give thee unto the blood of wrath and jealousy.
**39** And I will deliver thee into their hands, and they shall tear down thy harlot’s dwelling, and they shall cast down thy public stand, and they shall strip thee of thy garments, and they shall take the vessels of thy boasting.
**40** And they shall leave thee naked and unseemly. And they shall bring multitudes against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and they shall slaughter thee with their swords.
**41** And they shall burn thy houses with fire, and they shall execute judgments upon thee in the presence of many women; and I will turn thee away from thy fornication, and thou shalt no longer give wages.
**42** And I will pour out My wrath upon thee, and My jealousy shall be lifted from thee;
**43** And I shall be at rest, and I shall be anxious no longer, because thou didst not remember the day of thy youth, and didst grieve Me in all these things; and behold, I have recompensed thy ways upon thine own head, saith Adonai the Lord; and thus hast thou wrought thine impiety upon all thy iniquities.
**44** These are all things which they have spoken against thee in a proverb, saying, As the mother, so the daughter.
**45** And thou art the daughter of thy mother, who thrust away her husband and her children, and thy sisters are the sisters who thrust away their husbands and their children: your mother [was] a Hittite, and your father an Amorite.
**46** Your elder sister [is] Samaria, she and her daughters, who dwell to thy left hand; and thy younger sister [is] Sodom, she and her daughters, who dwell to thy right hand.
**47** And thou didst not walk even as in their ways, nor didst thou commit according to their iniquities even by a little, but rather, thou didst surpass them by a little in all thy ways.
**48** As I live, saith Adonai the Lord, surely Sodom thy sister, she and her daughters, hath not done in the manner thou and thy daughters have done.
**49** Moreover, this was the iniquity of Sodom thy sister: pride, in fullness of bread and in abundance of wine, she and her daughters revelled luxuriantly; this belonged to her and to her daughters.
**50** And they did not support the hand of the poor and needy, but they boasted greatly, and they committed iniquities before Me, and I removed them, as I had seen.
**51** And Samaria hath not sinned [even] as half of thy sins; for thou didst multiply thine iniquities beyond them, and thou didst justify thy sisters by all thy iniquities which thou didst commit.
