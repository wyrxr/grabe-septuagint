ἐμπαίζονται ἐν σοὶ ἀκάθαρτος ἢ ὀνομαστή, καὶ πολλὴ ἐν ταῖς ἀνομίαις.
**6** Ἰδοὺ οἱ ἀφηγοῦμενοι οἴκου Ἰσραήλ, ἕκαστος πρὸς τοὺς συγγενεῖς αὑτοῦ συναπεφύροντο ἐν σοί, ὅπως ἐγχέωσιν αἷμα.
**7** Πατέρα καὶ μητέρα ἐκακολόγουν ἐν σοί, καὶ πρὸς τὸν προσήλυτον ἀνεστρέφοντο ἐν ἀδικίαις ἐν σοί· ὀρφανὸν καὶ χήραν κατεδυνάστευον ἐν σοί·
**8** καὶ τὰ ἅγιά μου ἐξουθέουν, καὶ τὰ σάββατά μου ἐβεβήλουν ἐν σοί.
**9** Ἄνδρες λῃσταὶ ἦσαν ἐν σοί, ὅπως ἐκχέωσιν ἐν σοὶ αἷμα· καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν ὀρέων ἤσθιον ἐν σοί, ἀνόσια ἐποίουν ἐν μέσῳ σου.
**10** Αἰσχύνην πατρὸς ἀπεκάλυψαν ἐν σοί, καὶ ἐν ἀκαθαρσίαις ἀποκαθημένην ἐταπείνουν ἐν σοί.
**11** Ἕκαστος τὴν γυναῖκα τοῦ πλησίον αὑτοῦ ἠνομοῦσαν, καὶ ἕκαστος τὴν νύμφην αὑτοῦ ἐμίαῖνον ἐν ἀσεβείᾳ, καὶ ἕκαστος τὴν ἀδελφὴν αὑτοῦ θυγατέρα τοῦ πατρὸς αὑτοῦ ἐταπείνουν ἐν σοί.
**12** Δῶρα ἐλάμβανον ἐν σοί, ὅπως ἐκχέωσιν αἷμα· τόκον καὶ πλεονασμὸν ἐλαμβάνονσαν ἐν σοί· καὶ συνετελέσω συντέλειαν κακίας σου τὴν ἐν καταδυναστείᾳ σου, ὅτι ἐμοῦ ἐπελάθου, λέγει Κύριος Κύριος.
**13** Ἐὰν δὲ πατάξω χεῖρά μου πρὸς χεῖρά μου, ἐφ᾿ οἷς συντετέλεσαι, οἷς ἐποίησας, καὶ ἐπὶ τοῖς αἵμασί σου τοῖς γεγενημένοις ἐν μέσῳ σου,
**14** εἰ ὑποστήσεται ἡ καρδία σου; εἰ κρατήσουσιν αἱ χεῖρές σου ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις αἷς ἐγὼ ποιῶ ἐν σοί; ἐγὼ Κύριος λελάληκα καὶ ποιήσω.
**15** Καὶ διασκορπιῶ σε ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι, καὶ διασπερῶ σε ἐν ταῖς χώραις, καὶ ἐκλείψει ἡ ἀκαθαρσία σου ἐκ σοῦ,
**16** καὶ κατακληρονομήσω ἐν σοὶ ἐνώπιον τῶν ἐθνῶν, καὶ γνώσῃ, ὅτι ἐγὼ Κύριος.
**17** Καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς μέ, λέγων·
**18** υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, ἰδοὺ γεγονός μοι ὁ οἶκος Ἰσραὴλ ἀναμεμιγμένοι πάντες χαλκῷ, καὶ σιδήρῳ, καὶ κασσιτέρῳ, καὶ μολίβδῳ, ἐν μέσῳ καμίνου· ἀργύριον ἀναμεμιγμένον ἐστί.
**19** Διὰ τοῦτο εἶπον, τάδε λέγει Κύριος Κύριος ὁ Θεός· ἀνθ᾿ ὧν ἐγένεσθε πάντες εἰς σύγκρισιν μίαν, διὰ τοῦτο ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ εἰσδέχομαι ὑμᾶς εἰς μέσον Ἱερουσαλήμ.
**20** Καθὼς εἰσδέχεται ἄργυρος, καὶ χαλκός, καὶ σίδηρος, καὶ κασσίτερος, μόλιβδος εἰς μέσον καμίνου πυρός, τοῦ ἐμφυσῆσαι εἰς αὐτὰ πῦρ τοῦ χωνεύεται, οὕτως εἰσδέξομαι ὑμᾶς ἐν ὀργῇ μου καὶ ἐν τῷ θυμῷ μου, καὶ συνάξω καὶ χωνεύσω ὑμᾶς,
**21** καὶ ἐκφυσήσω ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς ἐκφύσημα ἐν πυρὶ ὀργῆς μου, καὶ χωνευθήσεσθε ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῆς.
**22** Ὃν τρόπον χωνεύεται ἀργύριον ἐν μέσῳ καμίνου, οὕτως χωνευθήσεσθε ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐπιγνώσεσθε, διότι ἐγὼ Κύριος ἐξέχεα τὸν θυμόν μου ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς.
**23** Καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς μέ, λέγων·

**6** Behold, the princes of the house of Israel, each one with his kindred, have mingled [themselves] in thee, that they might shed blood.
**7** Father and mother did they revile in thee; and toward the sojourner did they turn themselves with injustices in thee. The orphan and the widow did they oppress in thee;
**8** and My holy things did they despise, and My Sabbaths did they profane in thee.
**9** Men of plunder were in thee, that they might shed blood in thee; and upon the mountains did they eat in thee; impious things did they commit in thy midst.
**10** The nakedness of [their] father did they uncover in thee; and her that was set apart in her uncleanness did they defile in thee.
**11** Every man did commit lawlessness with the wife of his neighbor; and every man did defile his daughter-in-law with ungodliness; and every man did violate his sister, the daughter of his own father, in thee.
**12** Gifts did they take in thee, that they might shed blood. Usury and excessive gain did they take in thee. And thou didst bring to consummation the fullness of thy wickedness, [even] that which is in thy oppression, for thou hast forgotten Me, saith the Lord, the Lord.
**13** And if I shall smite My hand upon My hand, for that which thou hast completed, [even] that which thou hast wrought, and for thy bloods which have been in thy midst,
**14** shall thy heart endure? Shall thy hands be strong in the days which I make in thee? I the Lord have spoken, and I will do it.
**15** And I will scatter thee among the nations, and I will disperse thee through the lands, and thy uncleanness shall cease from thee;

**19** Therefore have I said, 'Thus saith the Lord, the Lord God: Forasmuch as ye are all become into one mixture, therefore behold, I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.
**20** As silver is gathered, and bronze, and iron, and tin, [and] lead into the midst of a furnace of fire, for to breathe fire into them, [even fire, to the end] that it may be melted; so will I gather you in My wrath and in My fury; and I will assemble and melt you,
**21** and I will blow upon you a blast with the fire of My wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof.
