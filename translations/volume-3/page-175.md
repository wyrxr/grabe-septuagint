παντὶ πεποιημένῳ ὑπὸ τὸν ἥλιον, ὅτι συνάντημα ἐν τοῖς πᾶσι·
καὶ γε καρδία υἱῶν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ἐπληρώθη πονηροῦ, καὶ περιφέ-
ρεια ἐν καρδίᾳ αὐτῶν ἐν ζωῇ αὐτῶν, καὶ ὀπίσω αὐτῶν πρὸς τοὺς
νεκρούς. Ὅτι τίς ὃς κοινωνεῖ πρὸς πάντας τοὺς ζῶντας; ἐστιν 4
ἐλπίς· ὅτι ὁ κύων ὁ ζῶν αὐτὸς ἀγαθὸς ὑπὲρ τὸν λέοντα τὸν νε-
κρόν. Ὅτι οἱ ζῶντες γινώσκονται ὅτι ἀποθανοῦνται, καὶ οἱ νεκροὶ 5
οὐκ εἰσὶ γινώσκοντες οὐδέν· καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν αὐτοῖς ἔτι μισθός, ὅτι
ἐπελήσθη ἡ μνήμη αὐτῶν· καὶ γε ἡ ἀγάπη αὐτῶν, καὶ γε μῖσος αὐ- 6
τῶν, καὶ γε ζῆλος αὐτῶν ἤδη ἀπώλετο, καὶ μερὶς οὐκ ἔστιν αὐτοῖς
ἔτι εἰς αἰῶνα ἐν παντὶ τῷ πεποιημένῳ ὑπὸ τὸν ἥλιον. Δεῦρο φά- 7
γε ἐν εὐφροσύνῃ τὸν ἄρτον σου, καὶ πίε ἐν καρδίᾳ ἀγαθῇ οἶνόν
σου, ὅτι ἤδη εὐδόκησεν ὁ Θεὸς τὰ ποιήματά σου. Ἐν παντὶ και- 8
ρῷ ἔστωσαν ἱμάτιά σου λευκά, καὶ ἔλαιον ἐπὶ κεφαλὴν σου μὴ
ὑστερησάτω· καὶ ἴδε ζωὴν μετὰ γυναικὸς ἧς ἠγάπησας, πάσας τὰς 9
ἡμέρας ζωῆς ματαιότητός σου, τὰς δοθείσας σοι ὑπὸ τὸν ἥλιον
πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας ματαιότητός σου· ὅτι αὐτὸ μερίς σου ἐν τῇ ζωῇ
σου, καὶ ἐν τῷ μόχθῳ σου ᾧ σὺ μοχθεῖς ὑπὸ τὸν ἥλιον. Πάντα 10
ὅσα ἂν εὕρῃ ἡ χείρ σου τοῦ ποιῆσαι, ὡς ἡ δύναμίς σου, ποίησον·
ὅτι οὐκ ἔστι ποίημα καὶ λογισμὸς καὶ γνῶσις καὶ σοφία ἐν ᾅδῃ,
ὅπου σὺ πορεύῃ ἐκεῖ. Ἐπέστρεψα καὶ ἴδον ὑπὸ τὸν ἥλιον, ὅτι οὐ 11
τοῖς κούφοις ὁ δρόμος, καὶ οὐ τοῖς δυνατοῖς ὁ πόλεμος, καὶ γε οὐ
τοῖς σοφοῖς ὁ ἄρτος, καὶ γε οὐ τοῖς συνετοῖς ὁ πλοῦτος, καὶ γε οὐ
τοῖς γινώσκουσι χάρις· ὅτι καιρὸς καὶ ἀπάντημα συναντήσεται
τοῖς πᾶσιν αὐτοῖς. Ὅτι καὶ γε οὐκ ἔγνω ὁ ἄνθρωπος τὸν καιρὸν 12
αὐτοῦ· ὡς οἱ ἰχθύες οἱ θηρευόμενοι ἐν ἀμφιβλήστρῳ κακῷ, καὶ ὡς
ὄρνεα τὰ θηρευόμενα ἐν παγίδι· ὡς αὐτά, παγιδεύονται οἱ υἱοὶ
τοῦ ἀνθρώπου εἰς καιρὸν πονηρόν, ὅταν ἐπιπέσῃ ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς ἄφνω.
Καὶ γε τοῦτο ἴδον σοφίαν ὑπὸ τὸν ἥλιον, καὶ μεγάλη ἐστὶ πρὸς μέ. 13
πόλις μικρὰ καὶ ἄνδρες ἐν αὐτῇ ὀλίγοι, καὶ ἔλθῃ ἐπ᾿ αὐτὴν βασι- 14
λεὺς μέγας, καὶ κυκλώσῃ αὐτήν, καὶ οἰκοδομήσῃ ἐπ᾿ αὐτὴν χάρα-
κας μεγάλους· καὶ εὕρῃ ἐν αὐτῇ ἄνδρα πέντηα (καὶ) σοφόν, καὶ 15
διασώσῃ αὐτὸς τὴν πόλιν ἐν τῇ σοφίᾳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἄνθρωπος οὐκ
ἐμνήσθη σὺν τοῦ ἀνδρὸς τοῦ πέντηος ἐκείνου. Καὶ εἶπα ἐγώ· 16
ἀγαθὴ σοφία ὑπὲρ δύναμιν, καὶ σοφία τοῦ πέντηος ἐξουδενωμένη,
καὶ λόγοι αὐτοῦ οὐκ εἰσὶν ἀκούμενοι. Λόγοι σοφῶν ἐν ἀνα- 17
παύσει ἀκούονται ὑπὲρ κραυγὴν ἐξουσιαζόντων ἐν ἀφροσύναις.

**CHAPTER 9**

**4** For who is he that is joined with all the living? [There] is hope;
    for a living dog is better than a dead lion.
**5** For the living know that they shall die;
    but the dead know nothing,
    neither have they any more a reward,
    for their memory is forgotten.
**6** And verily, their love, and their hatred, and their envy have already perished;
    neither have they any more a portion forever
    in anything that is done under the sun.
**7** Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy,
    and drink thy wine with a glad heart;
    for God hath already approved thy works.
**8** At all times let thy garments be white,
    and let not oil be lacking upon thy head.
**9** And behold life with the woman whom thou hast loved,
    all the days of the life of thy vanity,
    which have been given thee under the sun,
    even all the days of thy vanity;
    for this is thy portion in thy life,
    and in thy toil wherein thou toilest under the sun.
**10** Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do,
    do it with all thy might;
    for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in Hades,
    whither thou goest.
**11** I turned again, and saw under the sun,
    that the race is not to the swift,
    nor the battle to the strong,
    nor yet bread to the wise,
    nor yet riches to men of understanding,
    nor yet favor to those who have knowledge;
    for time and chance happeneth to them all.
**12** For verily, man knoweth not his time;
    as the fishes that are caught in an evil net,
    and as the birds that are caught in a snare,
    even so are the sons of men ensnared in an evil time,
    when it falleth suddenly upon them.
**13** And verily, this also have I seen [as] wisdom under the sun,
    and it appeared great unto me.
**14** [There was] a small city, and few men within it;
    and there came a great king against it,
    and encircled it,
    and built great bulwarks against it.
**15** And found therein a poor (and) wise man,
    and he saved the city by his wisdom;
    yet no man remembered that same poor man.
**16** Then said I,
    "Wisdom is better than strength;
    but the wisdom of the poor man is despised,
    and his words are not heard."
**17** The words of the wise, when spoken in quiet, are heard
    more than the cry of those who rule in foolishness.
