14 ἀστέρας ἀναγγειλάτωσάν σοι, τί μέλλει ἐπὶ σὲ ἔρχεσθαι. Ἰδοὺ
πάντες ὡς φρύγανα ἐπὶ πυρὶ κατακαήσονται, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἐξέ-
λωνται τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτῶν ἐκ φλογός, ὅτι ἔχεις ἄνθρακας πυ-
15 ρὸς, κάθησαι ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς, οὗτοι ἔσονται σοι βοήθεια. ἐκοπίασας ἐν
τῇ μεταβολῇ σου ἐκ νεότητος, ἄνθρωπος καθ᾽ ἑαυτὸν ἐπλανήθη,
σοι δὲ οὐκ ἔσται σωτηρία.

ΚΕΦ. ΜΗ´. XLVIII.

1 ΑΚΟΥΣΑΤΕ ταῦτα οἶκος Ἰακώβ, οἱ κεκλημένοι ἐπὶ τῷ
ὀνόματι Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ οἱ ἐξ ὕδατος Ἰούδα ἐξελθόντες, οἱ ὀμνύοντες
τῷ ὀνόματι Κυρίου καὶ Θεοῦ Ἰσραὴλ, μιμνησκόμενοι οὐ μετὰ
2 ἀληθείας, οὐδὲ μετὰ δικαιοσύνης, καὶ ἀντεχόμενοι τῷ ὀνόματι
τῆς πόλεως τῆς ἁγίας, καὶ ἐπὶ τῷ Θεῷ τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ ἀντιστη-
3 ριζόμενοι˙ Κύριος Σαβαὼθ ὄνομα αὐτῷ, τὰ πρότερα ἔτι ἀνήγ-
γειλα, καὶ ἐκ τοῦ στόματός μου ἐξῆλθε, καὶ ἀκουστὸν ἐγένετο˙
4 ἐξάπινα ἐποίησα, καὶ ἐπῆλθεν. Γινώσκω ἐγὼ, ὅτι σκληρὸς εἶ, καὶ
νεῦρον σιδηροῦν ὁ τράχηλός σου, καὶ τὸ μέτωπόν σου χαλκοῦν.
5 Καὶ ἀνήγγειλά σοι τὰ πάλαι πρὶν ἐλθεῖν ἐπὶ σέ˙ ἀκουστὸν σοι
ἐποίησα, μή ποτε εἴπῃς, ὅτι τὰ εἴδωλά μοι ἐποίησαν, καὶ μὴ
6 εἴπῃς˙ τὰ γλυπτὰ καὶ τὰ χωνευτὰ ἐνετείλατό μοι. Ἠκούσατε
πάντα, καὶ ὑμεῖς οὐκ ἔγνωτε˙ ἀλλὰ καὶ ἀκουστὰ σοι ἐποίη-
7 σα τὰ καινὰ ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν, ἃ μέλλει γίνεσθαι˙ καὶ οὐκ εἶπας, νῦν
γίνεται, καὶ οὐ πάλαι, καὶ οὐ προτέραις ἡμέραις ἤκουσας αὐ-
8 τά˙ μὴ εἴπῃς˙ ὅτι ναὶ γινώσκω αὐτά. Οὔτε ἔγνως, οὔτε ἠπί-
στω, οὔτε ἀπ᾽ ἀρχῆς ἤνοιξα τὰ ὦτά σου˙ ἔγνων γὰρ ὅτι ἀ-
9 θετῶν ἀθετήσεις, καὶ ἄνομος ἔτι ἐκ κοιλίας κληθήσῃ. Ἕνεκεν τοῦ
ἐμοῦ ὀνόματος δείξω σοι τὸν θυμόν μου, καὶ τὰ ἔνδοξά μου ἐπά-
10 ξω ἐπὶ σοὶ, ἵνα μὴ ἐξολεθρεύσω σε. Ἰδοὺ πέπρακά σε, οὐχ
11 ἕνεκεν ἀργυρίου˙ ἐξειλάμην δέ σε ἐκ καμίνου πτωχείας˙ ἕνεκεν
ἐμοῦ ποιήσω σοι, ὅτι τὸ ἐμὸν ὄνομα βεβηλοῦται, καὶ τὴν δό-
12 ξαν μου ἑτέρῳ οὐ δώσω. Ἄκουέ μου Ἰακώβ, καὶ Ἰσραὴλ ὃν
13 ἐγὼ καλῶ˙ ἐγὼ εἰμι πρῶτος, καὶ ἐγὼ εἰμι εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα. Καὶ
ἡ χείρ μου ἐθεμελίωσε τὴν γῆν, καὶ ἡ δεξιά μου ἐστερέωσε τὸν
14 οὐρανόν˙ καλέσω ἐγὼ αὐτοὺς, καὶ στήσονται ἅμα, καὶ συνα-
χθήσονται πάντες, καὶ ἀκούσονται˙ τίς αὐτοῖς ἀνήγγειλε ταῦτα;
Κύριος ἀγαπῶν σε ἐποίησα (ταῦτα) ἐπὶ Βαβυλῶνα τὸ θέλημά

#### Chapter 47

**14** the stars, let them announce unto thee
    what is about to come upon thee.
    Behold, all [of them] shall be burned up as stubble upon the fire,
    and they shall not deliver their souls from the flame;
    for thou hast coals of fire, [whereupon] thou sittest;
    these shall be for thy help.
**15** Thou hast wearied thyself with thy varied practices from thy youth;
    each man hath strayed for himself,
    yet for thee there shall be no salvation.

#### Chapter 48

**1** Hear these things, O house of Jacob,
    ye that are called by the name of Israel,
    and ye that have come forth from the waters of Judah;
    ye that swear by the name of the Lord
    and of the God of Israel,
    remembering not with truth,
    nor with righteousness;
**2** and clinging to the name of the holy city,
    and leaning upon the God of Israel.
    The Lord of Sabaoth is His name.
**3** The former things I announced beforehand,
    and out of My mouth did it proceed,
    and it was heard;
**4** suddenly I brought it to pass, and it came.
    I know that thou art stubborn,
    and thy neck is a sinew of iron,
    and thy forehead is bronze.
**5** And I announced unto thee the things of old,
    before they came upon thee;
    I made them heard unto thee,
    lest at any time thou shouldst say,
    'Mine idols have wrought them for me,'
    and lest thou shouldst say,
    'The graven images and the molten images commanded them unto me.'
**6** Ye have heard all things, and ye have not known them;
    but also I have made new things heard unto thee from this time forward,
    which are about to come to pass;
**7** and thou didst not say, 'Now it cometh to pass,'
    and not of old, and not in former days didst thou hear them;
**8** lest thou shouldst say, 'Yea, I know them.'
    Neither didst thou know, nor didst thou believe,
    nor from the beginning did I open thine ears;
    for I knew that utterly thou wouldst transgress,
    and lawless still from the womb shalt thou be called.
**9** For the sake of My name will I show thee My wrath,
    and My glorious deeds will I bring upon thee,
    that I may not utterly destroy thee.
**10** Behold, I have sold thee, not for the sake of silver;
**11** but I have delivered thee out of the furnace of affliction.
    For My sake will I do [this] for thee,
    because My name is profaned,
    and My glory will I not give to another.
**12** Hearken unto Me, O Jacob, and Israel, whom I call;
    I am the First, and I am for ever.
**13** And My hand hath founded the earth,
    and My right hand hath made firm the heaven;
    I shall call them, and they shall stand together,
    and all shall be gathered together, and they shall hear:
**14** Who hath declared these things to them?
    The Lord, [even He] that loveth thee,
    I have wrought (these things) upon Babylon,
    [even] thy will, to root out the seed of the Chaldeans.
