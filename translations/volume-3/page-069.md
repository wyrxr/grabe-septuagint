50 τὰ ἐλέη σου τὰ ἀρχαῖα Κύριε, ἃ ὤμοσας τῷ Δαυΐδ ἐν τῇ ἀληθείᾳ
51 σου; Μνήσθητι Κύριε τοῦ ὀνειδισμοῦ τῶν δούλων σου, οὗ ὑπέσχον
52 ἐν τῷ κόλπῳ μου πολλῶν ἐθνῶν· οὗ ὠνείδισαν οἱ ἐχθροί σου Κύριε,
οὗ ὠνείδισαν τὸ ἀντάλλαγμα τοῦ χριστοῦ σου. Εὐλογητὸς Κύ-
53 ριος εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα· γένοιτο, γένοιτο.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ΠΘʹ. LXXXIX.**

1 ΠΡΟΣΕΥΧΗ τῷ Μωσῇ ἀνθρώπῳ τοῦ Θεοῦ. Κύριε καταφυγὴ
2 σὺ ἐγενήθης ἡμῖν ἐν γενεᾷ καὶ γενεᾷ· πρὸ τοῦ ὄρη γενηθῆναι καὶ
πλασθῆναι τὴν γῆν καὶ τὴν οἰκουμένην, καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ αἰῶνος καὶ
3 ἕως τοῦ αἰῶνος σὺ εἶ ὁ Θεός. Μὴ ἀποστρέψῃς ἄνθρωπον εἰς τα-
πείνωσιν, καὶ εἴπας· ἐπιστρέψατε οἱ υἱοὶ τῶν ἀνθρώπων.
4 Ὅτι χίλια ἔτη ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς σου (Κύριε) ὡς ἡ ἡμέρα ἡ ἐχθὲς ἥτις
5 διῆλθε, καὶ φυλακὴ ἐν νυκτί. Τὰ ἐξουδενώματα αὐτῶν ἔτη ἔσον-
6 ται· τοπρωὶ ὡσεὶ χλόη παρέλθοι, τὸ πρωὶ ἀνθήσαι καὶ παρέλθοι·
7 τὸ ἑσπέρας ἀποπέσοι, σκληρυνθείη καὶ ἐξηρανθείη. Ὅτι ἐξελείπο-
8 μεν ἐν τῇ ὀργῇ σου, καὶ ἐν τῷ θυμῷ σου ἐταράχθημεν. Ἔθου τὰς
ἀνομίας ἡμῶν ἐνώπιόν σου· ὁ αἰὼν ἡμῶν εἰς φωτισμὸν τοῦ προ-
9 σώπου σου. Ὅτι πᾶσαι αἱ ἡμέραι ἡμῶν ἐξέλειπον, καὶ ἐν τῇ ὀρ-
γῇ σου ἐξελείπομεν· τὰ ἔτη ἡμῶν ὡσεὶ ἀράχνη ἐμελέτων.
10 Αἱ ἡμέραι τῶν ἐτῶν ἡμῶν ἐν αὐτοῖς ἑβδομήκοντα ἔτη, ἐὰν δὲ ἐν δυ-
ναστείαις, ὀγδοήκοντα ἔτη, καὶ τὸ πλεῖον αὐτῶν κόπος καὶ πόνος·
11 ὅτι ἐπῆλθε πραότης (ἐφ᾿ ἡμᾶς), καὶ παιδευθησόμεθα. Τίς γινώ-
σκει τὸ κράτος τῆς ὀργῆς σου; καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ φόβου σου τὸν θυμόνσου
12 ἐξαριθμήσασθαι; Τὴν δεξιάν σου οὕτως γνώρισόν (μοι), καὶ τοὺς
πεπαιδευμένους τῇ καρδίᾳ ἐν σοφίᾳ.
13 Ἐπίστρεψον Κύριε, ἕως πότε; καὶ παρακλήθητι ἐπὶ τοῖς δούλοις
14 σου. Ἐνεπλήσθημεν τοπρωὶ τοῦ ἐλέους σου, καὶ ἠγαλλιασάμεθα
καὶ εὐφράνθημεν· ἐν πάσαις ταῖς
15 ἡμέραις ἡμῶν εὐφράνθημεν, ἀνθ᾿ ὧν ἡμερῶν ἐταπείνωσας ἡμᾶς,
16 ἐτῶν ὧν εἴδομεν κακά. Καὶ ἰδε ἐπὶ τοὺς δούλους σου, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ
ἔργα σου, καὶ ὁδήγησον τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτῶν·
17 καὶ ἔστω ἡ λαμπρότης Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν ἐφ᾿ ἡμᾶς, καὶ τὰ
ἔργα τῶν χειρῶν ἡμῶν κατεύθυνον· ἐφ᾿ ἡμᾶς, καὶ τὰ ἔργα τῶν
χειρῶν ἡμῶν κατεύθυνον.

**PSALM LXXXVIII.**

50 Where are Thy mercies of old, O Lord,
Which Thou didst swear unto David in Thy truth?
51 Remember, O Lord, the reproach of Thy servants,
Which I have borne in my bosom, [even the reproach] of many nations;
52 Wherewith Thine enemies have reproached, O Lord,
Wherewith they have reproached the recompense of Thine Anointed.
53 Blessed be the Lord for evermore. Amen, and Amen.

**PSALM LXXXIX.**
A Prayer of Moses, the Man of God.

1 Lord, Thou hast been our refuge
In all generations.
2 Before the mountains were brought forth,
Or ever Thou hadst formed the earth and the world,
Even from everlasting to everlasting, Thou art God.
3 Thou turnest not man to humiliation,
And Thou sayest, "Return, ye sons of men."
4 For a thousand years in Thy sight, O Lord,
Are but as yesterday, when it is past,
And as a watch in the night.
5 Their abasements shall be [as] years;
In the morning it is like grass that passeth away,
6 In the morning it blossometh and passeth away;
In the evening it falleth off, it is hardened and withered.
7 For we perish by Thy wrath,
And by Thy fury are we troubled.
8 Thou hast set our iniquities before Thee;
Our lifetime [is brought] into the light of Thy countenance.
9 For all our days have passed away,
And in Thy wrath do we perish;
Our years, as a spider's web, they did weave.
10 The days of our years in them are seventy years;
But if by reason of strength, they be eighty years;
And the greater part of them is labour and sorrow.
11 For gentleness hath come upon us,
And we shall be disciplined.
Who knoweth the power of Thy wrath?
And [who can] reckon Thy fury by the fear of Thee?
12 Thus make known unto me Thy right hand,
And them that are instructed in heart with wisdom.
13 Return, O Lord, how long?
And be entreated concerning Thy servants.
14 Let us be filled early with Thy mercy;
That we may rejoice and be glad in all our days.
15 We shall rejoice according to the days wherein Thou hast humbled us,
And the years wherein we have seen evils.
16 And look upon Thy servants, and upon Thy works,
And guide their children.
17 And let the splendour of the Lord our God be upon us;
And do Thou direct the works of our hands.
Yea, upon us, and the works of our hands, do Thou direct.
