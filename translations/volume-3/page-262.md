**15.** θυμίαν, καὶ διδὸς ζωὴν τοῖς συντετριμμένοις τὴν καρδίαν·
**16.** καὶ οὐκ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα ἐκδικήσω ὑμᾶς, οὐδὲ διαπαντὸς ὀργισθήσομαι ὑμῖν· πνεῦμα γὰρ παρ᾿ ἐμοῦ ἐξελεύσεται, καὶ πνοὴν πᾶσαν
**17.** ἐγὼ ἐποίησα. Διὰ ἁμαρτίαν βραχύ τι ἐλύπησα αὐτόν, καὶ ἐπάταξα αὐτόν, καὶ ἀπέστρεψα τὸ πρόσωπόν μου ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐλυπήθη, καὶ ἐπορεύθη στυγνὸς ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς τῆς καρδίας αὐτοῦ·
**18.** τὰς ὁδοὺς αὐτοῦ ἑώρακα, καὶ ἰασάμην αὐτόν, καὶ παρεκάλεσα αὐτόν, καὶ ἔδωκα αὐτῷ παράκλησιν ἀληθινὴν, καὶ τοῖς παθηνοῖς αὐτοῦ·
**19.** κτίζων καρπὸν χειλέων εἰρήνην ἐπ᾿ εἰρήνην τοῖς μακρὰν καὶ τοῖς ἐγγὺς οὖσι. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος· ἰάσομαι αὐτούς.
**20.** Οἱ δὲ ἄδικοι ὡς θάλασσα οὕτως κλυδωνισθήσονται, καὶ ἀναπάσασθαι οὐ δυνήσονται· καὶ ἀποβάλλεται ὕδωρ αὐτῆς καταπάτημα καὶ πηλόν.
**21.** Οὐκ ἔστι χαίρειν τοῖς ἀσεβέσιν, εἶπεν (Κύριος) ὁ Θεός.

**ΚΕΦ. ΝΗ΄. LVIII.**

**1.** ΑΝΑΒΟΗΣΟΝ ἐν ἰσχύϊ, καὶ μὴ φείσῃ, ὡς σάλπιγγα ὕψωσον τὴν φωνήν σου, καὶ ἀνάγγειλον τῷ λαῷ μου τὰ ἁμαρτήματα αὐτῶν, καὶ τῷ οἴκῳ Ἰακὼβ τὰς ἀνομίας αὐτῶν.
**2.** Ἐμὲ ἡμέραν ἐξ ἡμέρας ζητήσουσι, καὶ γνῶναι μου τὰς ὁδοὺς ἐπιθυμοῦσιν, ὡς λαὸς ὁ δικαιοσύνην (Θεοῦ) πεποιηκώς, καὶ κρίσιν Θεοῦ αὐτοῦ μὴ ἐγκαταλελοιπώς· αἰτοῦσί με νῦν κρίσιν δικαίαν, καὶ ἐγγίζειν Θεῷ ἐπιθυμοῦσι, λέγοντες·
**3.** τί ὅτι ἐνηστεύσαμεν, καὶ οὐκ εἶδες ; ἐταπεινώσαμεν τὰς ψυχὰς ἡμῶν, καὶ οὐκ ἔγνως ; ἐν γὰρ ταῖς ἡμέραις τῶν νηστειῶν ὑμῶν εὑρίσκετε τὰ θελήματα ὑμῶν,
**4.** καὶ πάντας τοὺς ὑποχειρίους ὑμῶν ὑπονοῦσσετε. Ἰδοὺ εἰς κρίσεις καὶ μάχας νηστεύετε, καὶ τύπτετε πυγμαῖς ταπεινὸν· ἵνατί μοι νηστεύετε ὡς σήμερον, ἀκουσθῆναι ἐν κραυγῇ τὴν φωνὴν ὑμῶν ;
**5.** Οὐ ταύτην τὴν νηστείαν ἐξελεξάμην, καὶ ἡμέραν ταπεινοῦν ἄνθρωπον τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ, οὐδ᾿ ἂν κάμψῃς ὡς κρίκον τὸν τράχηλόν σου, καὶ σάκκον καὶ σποδὸν ὑποστρώσῃ, οὐδ᾿ οὕτως καλέσετε νηστείαν καὶ ἡμέραν δεκτήν τῷ Κυρίῳ.
**6.** Οὐχὶ τοιαύτην νηστείαν ἐγὼ ἐξελεξάμην, λέγει Κύριος, ἀλλὰ λῦε πάντα σύνδεσμον ἀδικίας, διάλυε στραγγαλιὰς βιαίων συναλλαγμάτων, ἀπόστελλε τεθραυσμένους ἐν ἀφέσει, καὶ πᾶσαν συγγραφὴν ἄδικον διάσπα.

#### Chapter 57

**15** ...long-suffering, and giving life unto the contrite of heart.
**16** For I will not contend with you forever,
    neither will I be wroth with you continually;
    for the spirit shall go forth from Me,
    and every breath have I made.
**17** For a sin, I grieved him but a little,
    and smote him, and turned My face from him;
    and he was grieved, and went on sorrowfully
    in the ways of his heart.
**18** I have seen his ways, and healed him;
    and comforted him, and gave unto him true consolation,
    and to his mourners.
**19** Creating the fruit of the lips, peace upon peace,
    to them that are far off, and to them that are nigh.
    And the Lord said, "I will heal them."
**20** But the wicked shall be tossed as the sea,
    and shall not be able to find rest;
    and its water casteth forth mire and clay.
**21** There is no joy for the ungodly,
    saith the Lord God.

#### Chapter 58

**1** Cry aloud with strength, and spare not;
    lift up thy voice as a trumpet,
    and declare unto My people their sins,
    and to the house of Jacob their iniquities.
**2** Yet Me they seek day by day,
    and to know My ways do they desire,
    as a people that hath wrought righteousness (of God),
    and hath not forsaken the judgment of its God.
    They ask of Me now righteous judgment,
    and desire to draw near to God, saying:
**3** "Wherefore have we fasted, and Thou sawest not?
    Wherefore have we humbled our souls, and Thou didst not know?"
    For in the days of your fasts
    ye find your own pleasures,
**4** and all those under your hand ye oppress.
    Behold, ye fast for judgments and strifes,
    and strike the humble with fists.
    To what end do ye fast to Me as this day,
    that your voice should be heard in a cry?
**5** Is not this the fast that I have chosen,
    and a day for a man to humble his soul?
    Nor if thou shouldst bend thy neck as a ring,
    and spread sackcloth and ashes beneath [thee],
    not even thus shall ye call it a fast
    and a day acceptable to the Lord.
**6** Is not this rather the fast that I have chosen,
    saith the Lord?
    But loosen every bond of iniquity,
    untie the oppressive cords of violent transactions;
    send forth the bruised [and] broken in release,
    and every unjust bond tear asunder.
