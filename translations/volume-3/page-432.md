ΚΕΦ. ΚΔʹ.
5 καὶ ὤμων· ἐκσεσαρχισμένα ἐκ τῶν ὀστέων αὐτῶν, ἐξ ἐπιλέκτων κτηνῶν εἰλημμένα· καὶ ὑπόκαιε τὰ ὀστᾶ ὑποκάτω αὐτῶν, ἔζεσε
6 καὶ ἐξέζεσε, καὶ ἠψήθη τὰ ὀστᾶ ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῆς. Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναὶ Κύριος· ὦ πόλις αἱμάτων λέβης, ἐν ᾧ ἐστιν ἰὸς ἐν αὐτῷ, καὶ ὁ ἰὸς ἐν αὐτῷ οὐκ ἐξῆλθεν ἐξ αὐτῆς, κατὰ μέλος
7 αὐτῆς ἐξήνεγκεν, οὐκ ἔπεσεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὴν κλῆρος. Ὅτι αἷμα αὐτῆς ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῆς ἐστιν, ἐπὶ λεωπετρίαν τέταχα αὐτό· οὐκ ἐκκέχυκα
8 αὐτὸ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, τοῦ καλύψαι ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸ γῆν, τοῦ ἀναθῆναι θυμὸν εἰς ἐκδίκησιν ἐκδικηθῆναι· δέδωκα τὸ αἷμα αὐτῆς ἐπὶ
9 λεωπετρίαν, τοῦ μὴ καλύψαι αὐτό. Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναὶ Κύριος· οὐαὶ πόλις τῶν αἱμάτων· κἀγὼ μεγαλυνῶ τὸν δαλόν,
10 καὶ πληθυνῶ τὰ ξύλα, καὶ ἐκκαύσω τὸ πῦρ, ὅπως ἐλαττωθῇ
11 ὁ ζωμός, καὶ ἐκτακῇ τὰ κρέα, καὶ τὰ ὀστᾶ συμφρυγήσωνται, καὶ στῆ ἐπὶ τοὺς ἄνθρακας αὐτῆς, ἐξηρόφῃ, ὅπως ἐκκαυθῇ, ὅπως συμφρυγῇ
12 ὁ χαλκός αὐτῆς, καὶ ταχῇ ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῆς ἡ ἀκαθαρσία αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐκλίπῃ ὁ ἰὸς αὐτῆς, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἐξέλθῃ ἐξ αὐτῆς πολύς
13 ὁ ἰὸς αὐτῆς, καὶ καταισχυνθήσεται ὁ ἰὸς αὐτῆς, ἐν τῇ ἀκαθαρσίᾳ σου ζέμμα, ἀνθ᾿ ὧν ἐμιάνθης σύ, καὶ οὐκ ἐκαθαρίσθη ἀπὸ ἀκαθαρσίας σου, καὶ τί ἔσται ἐὰν μὴ καθαρισθῇ ἔτι, ἕως οὗ ἐμπλήσω
14 τὸν θυμόν μου ἐν σοί. Ἐγὼ Κύριος λελάληκα, καὶ ἥξει, καὶ ποιήσω, οὐ διαστελῶ, οὐδὲ μὴ ἐλεήσω· κατὰ τὰς ὁδούς σου, καὶ κατὰ τὰ ἐνθυμήματά σου κρινῶ σε, λέγει Ἀδωναὶ Κύριος. Διὰ τοῦτο ἐγὼ κρινῶ σε κατὰ τὰ αἵματά σου, καὶ κατὰ τὰ ἐνθυμήματά
15 σου κρινῶ σε, ἢ ἀκάθαρτος, ἢ ὀνομαστή, καὶ πολλή, τοῦ παραπικραίνειν. Καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς με, λέγων· υἱὲ
16 ἀνθρώπου, ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ λαμβάνω ἐκ σοῦ, τὰ ἐπιθυμήματα ὀφθαλμῶν σου ἐν παρατάξει, οὐ μὴ κοπῇς, οὐδ᾿ οὐ μὴ κλαυθῇς, οὐδὲ μὴ
17 ἔλθῃ σοι δάκρυα. Στεναγμὸς αἵματος, ὀσφῦς πένθους ἔσται αὕτη· οὐκ ἔσται τὸ τρίχωμά σου συμπεπλεγμένον ἐπὶ σέ, καὶ τὰ ὑποδήματά σου ἐν τοῖς ποσί σου, οὐ μὴ παρακληθῇς ἐν χείλεσιν αὐτῶν,
18 καὶ ἄρτον ἀνδρῶν οὐ μὴ φάγῃς. Καὶ ἐλάλησα πρὸς τὸν λαὸν τοπρωΐ, ὃν τρόπον ἐνετείλατό μοι, καὶ ἀπέθανεν ἡ γυνή μου
19 ἑσπέρας, καὶ ἐποίησα τοπρωΐ καθὼς ἐπετάγη μοι. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς
20 με ὁ λαός· οὐκ ἀπαγγείλεις ἡμῖν, τί ἐστι ταῦτα ἃ σὺ ποιεῖς; Καὶ
21 εἶπα πρὸς αὐτούς· λόγος Κυρίου ἐγένετο πρὸς με, λέγων· εἰπὸν πρὸς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Ἰσραήλ· τάδε λέγει Κύριος Κύριος ὁ Θεός· ἰδοὺ

**5** and shoulder; stripped of their bones was the flesh, taken from chosen beasts. And kindle the bones beneath them; let it boil
**6** and boil over, and let the bones be seethed within it. Therefore thus saith Adonai the Lord: 'O bloody city, a cauldron wherein is its very filth, and the filth within it hath not departed from it, piece by piece.
**7** For her blood is in her midst; upon the smooth rock have I set it; I have not poured it out
**8** upon the earth, that earth might cover it; to set up My wrath to take vengeance, to be avenged. I have put her blood upon
**9** the smooth rock, that it might not be covered. Therefore thus saith Adonai the Lord: "Woe unto the city of bloods! And I shall make great the firebrand,
**10** and I shall multiply the wood, and I shall kindle the fire, that the broth may be diminished,
**11** and the meats be melted away, and the bones be utterly consumed; and let it stand upon her coals, and be dried up, that it may be utterly burned, that its bronze may be scorched;
**12** yea, its bronze, and her uncleanness in her midst be melted, and her filth vanish; yet much of her filth shall not depart from her.
**13** Her filth, and her filth shall be put to shame. In thy uncleanness is scum, because of which thou becamest defiled, and wast not cleansed from thy uncleanness. And what shall be, if it be not yet cleansed, until I fulfill
**14** My wrath upon thee! I the Lord have spoken it, and it shall come; and I shall do it; I shall not hold back, neither shall I pity. According to thy ways, and according to thy thoughts shall I judge thee, saith Adonai the Lord. Therefore shall I judge thee according to thy bloods, and according to thy thoughts shall I judge thee,
**15** whether [thou be] unclean, or [whether thou be] renowned and great in thy bitter provocation." And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying:
**16** "Son of man, behold, I take from thee the desire of thine eyes by a sudden stroke; thou shalt not mourn, neither shalt thou weep, nor shall
**17** tears come unto thee. A groaning as of blood; this shall be the loin of mourning. Thy hair shall not be bound upon thee, and thy shoes shall be upon thy feet; thou shalt not be comforted by their words,
**18** and the bread of mourners shalt thou not eat." And I spoke unto the people in the morning, in such wise as He commanded me; and my wife died
**19** in the evening; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.
**20** And the people said unto me: "Wilt thou not declare unto us what these things are which thou doest?"
**21** And I said unto them: "The word of the Lord came unto me, saying: 'Say unto the house of Israel: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold,"
