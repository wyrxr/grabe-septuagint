ΚΕΦ. Λ´. XXX.

1.2 ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς με, λέγων· υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου
προφήτευσον, καὶ εἰπὸν· τάδε λέγει Κύριος· ὀλολύξατε, ὦ ἡ ἡμέρα,
3 ὅτι ἐγγὺς ἡ ἡμέρα καὶ ἐγγὺς ἡ ἡμέρα τοῦ Κυρίου, ἡμέρα νεφέλης,
4 καιρὸς πέρας ἐθνῶν ἔσται, καὶ ἥξει ἡ μάχαιρα ἐπ᾽ Αἴγυπτον, καὶ ἔ-
σται ταραχὴ ἐν τῇ Αἰθιοπίᾳ, καὶ πεσοῦνται τετραυματισμένοι ἐν Αἰ-
γύπτῳ, καὶ λήψονται τὸ πλῆθος αὐτῆς, καὶ συμπεσεῖται τὰ θε-
5 μέλια αὐτῆς. Πέρσαι, καὶ Κρῆτες, καὶ Λυδοὶ, καὶ Λίβυες, καὶ
πάντες οἱ ἐπίμικτοι (ἐπ᾽ αὐτὴν) καὶ Χοὺβ, ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν γῆς
6 διαθήκης μου ἐπ᾽ αὐτῶν, μαχαίρᾳ πεσοῦνται. Τάδε λέγει Κύ-
ριος· καὶ πεσοῦνται τὰ ἀντιστηρίγματα Αἰγύπτου, καὶ κατα-
θήσεται ἡ ὕβρις τῆς ἰσχύος αὐτῆς ἀπὸ Μαγδωλοῦ ἕως Σουήνης.
7 μαχαίρᾳ πεσοῦνται ἐν αὐτῇ, λέγει Κύριος. Καὶ ἐρημωθήσεται
ἐν μέσῳ χωρῶν ἠρανισμένων, καὶ αἱ πόλεων αὐτῶν ἐν μέσῳ πόλεων
8 ἠρημωμένων ἔσονται, καὶ γνώσονται πάντες, ὅτι ἐγὼ εἰμι
Κύριος, ὅταν δῶ πῦρ ἐπ᾽ Αἴγυπτον, καὶ συντριβῶσι πάντες οἱ
9 βοηθοῦντες αὐτῇ. Ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἐξελεύσονται ἄγγελοι ἀπὸ
προσώπου μου ἐν Σιεὶμ σπεύδοντες ἀφανίσαι τὴν Αἰθιοπίαν τὴν
ἐλπίδα, καὶ ἔσται ταραχὴ ἐν αὐτοῖς ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ Αἰγύπτου, ὅτι
10 ἰδοὺ ἥκει. Τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναὶ Κύριος· καὶ ἀπολῶ πλῆθος Αἰ-
11 γυπτίων διὰ χειρὸς Ναβουχοδονόσορ βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος, αὐτοῦ,
καὶ τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ, λοιμοὶ ἀπὸ ἐθνῶν ἀπεσταλμένοι ἀπολέσαι
τὴν γῆν· καὶ ἐκκενώσουσι πάντες τὰς μαχαίρας αὐτῶν ἐπ᾽ Αἴ-
12 γυπτον, καὶ πλησθήσεται τραυματιῶν ἡ γῆ, καὶ δώσω τοὺς πο-
ταμοὺς αὐτῶν ἐρήμους, καὶ ἀποδώσομαι τὴν γῆν ἐν χειρὶ πονη-
ρῶν, καὶ ἀπολῶ τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν, καὶ τὸ πλήρωμα αὐτῆς ἐν χερ-
13 σὶν ἀλλοτρίων, ἐγὼ Κύριος ἐλάλησα. Ὅτι τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναὶ
Κύριος· καὶ ἀπολῶ βδελύγματα, καὶ καταπαύσω μεγιστᾶνας ἀπὸ
Μέμφεως, καὶ ἄρχοντας Τάνεως ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, καὶ οὐκ ἔ-
14 σονται οὐκέτι· καὶ δώσω φόβον ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτου. Καὶ ἀφανιῶ γῆν
Παβουρῆς, καὶ δώσω πῦρ ἐπὶ Τάνιν, καὶ ποιήσω ἐκδίκησιν ἐν Δι-
15 οσπόλει. Καὶ ἐκχεῶ τὸν θυμόν μου ἐπὶ Σαὶν τὴν ἰσχὺν Αἰγύπτου,
16 καὶ ἀπολῶ τὸ πλῆθος Μέμφεως, καὶ δώσω πῦρ ἐπ᾽ Αἴγυπτον,
καὶ ταραχὴ ταραχθήσεται Σουήνη, καὶ ἐν Διοσπόλει ἔσται ἐκ-

**Chapter 30**

**1** And it came to pass, the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
**2** Son of man, prophesy, and say, "Thus saith the Lord: Wail ye, Alas the day!"
**3** For the day [is] nigh, yea, the day of the Lord [is] nigh, a day of clouds;
**4** it shall be a time of the end of the nations, and the sword shall come upon Egypt, and there shall be turmoil in Ethiopia; and the wounded shall fall in Egypt, and they shall seize her multitude, and her foundations shall collapse.
**5** Persians, and Cretans, and Lydians, and Libyans, and all the mixed multitude (against her), and Chub, and [those] from among the sons of the land of My covenant [who come] against them, by the sword shall they fall.
**6** Thus saith the Lord: And the supports of Egypt shall fall, and the pride of her strength shall be brought low, from Migdol even unto Syene.
**7** By the sword shall they fall within her, saith the Lord. And she shall be made desolate in the midst of wasted lands, and her cities shall be in the midst of desolate cities;
**8** and all shall know that I am the Lord, when I set fire upon Egypt, and all her helpers shall be shattered.
**9** In that day, messengers shall go forth from My presence in Sieim, hastening to utterly destroy Ethiopia, [even] the hope [of Egypt]; and there shall be turmoil among them on the day of Egypt, for behold, it cometh.
**10** Thus saith Adonai the Lord: And I will destroy the multitude of Egyptians by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon;
**11** even he, and his people, [who are] destroyers sent from the nations to destroy the land; and all of them shall unsheath their swords against Egypt, and the land shall be filled with the wounded.
**12** And I will make their rivers desolate, and I will deliver up the land into the hand of evil men, and I will destroy their land, and the fullness thereof, by the hands of strangers; I the Lord have spoken [it].
**13** For thus saith Adonai the Lord: I will also destroy the abominations, and I will cause the great men to cease from Memphis, and the princes of Tanis from the land of Egypt; and they shall be no more;
**14** and I will put fear in the land of Egypt. And I will utterly destroy the land of Paboures, and I will set fire upon Tanis, and I will execute judgment in Diospolis.
**15** And I will pour out My wrath upon Sain, the strength of Egypt;
**16** and I will destroy the multitude of Memphis, and I will set fire upon Egypt, and Syene shall be greatly troubled; and in Diospolis there shall be a breach,
