τῆς πύλης εἰσελεύσεται, καὶ κατὰ τὴν ὁδὸν τῆς πύλης ἐξελεύσεται.
⁹ Καὶ ἔσται ὅταν εἰσπορεύηται ὁ λαὸς τῆς γῆς ἐναντίον Κυρίου ἐν ταῖς ἑορταῖς, ὁ εἰσπορευόμενος κατὰ τὴν ὁδὸν τῆς πύλης τῆς πρὸς βορρᾶν προσκυνεῖν, ἐξελεύσεται κατὰ τὴν ὁδὸν τῆς πύλης τῆς πρὸς νότον· καὶ ὁ εἰσπορευόμενος κατὰ τὴν ὁδὸν τῆς πύλης τῆς πρὸς νότον, ἐξελεύσεται κατὰ τὴν ὁδὸν τῆς πύλης τῆς πρὸς βορρᾶν, οὐκ ἀναστρέψει κατὰ τὴν πύλην εἰς ἣν εἰσελήλυθεν,
¹⁰ ἀλλ’ ἢ κατ’ εὐθὺ αὐτῆς ἐξελεύσεται. Καὶ ὁ ἀφηγούμενος ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῶν ἐν τῷ εἰσπορεύεσθαι αὐτοὺς εἰσελεύσεται μετ’ αὐτῶν, καὶ
¹¹ ἐν τῷ ἐκπορεύεσθαι αὐτοὺς ἐξελεύσεται μετ’ αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἑορταῖς καὶ ἐν ταῖς πανηγύρεσιν ἔσται τὸ Μαναὰ πέμμα τῷ μόσχῳ, καὶ πέμμα τῷ κριῷ καὶ τοῖς ἀμνοῖς, καθὼς ἂν ἐκποιῇ ἡ χεὶρ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐλαίου τὸ εἶν ἐν τῷ πέμματι.
¹² Ἐὰν δὲ ποιήσῃ ὁ ἀφηγούμενος ὁμολογίαν ὁλοκαύτωμα σωτηρίου τῷ Κυρίῳ, καὶ ἀνοίξει ἑαυτῷ τὴν πύλην τὴν βλέπουσαν κατ’ ἀνατολάς, καὶ ποιήσει τὸ ὁλοκαύτωμα αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰ τοῦ σωτηρίου αὐτοῦ, ὃν τρόπον ποιεῖ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῶν σαββάτων· καὶ ἐξελεύσεται,
¹³ καὶ κλείσει τὰς θύρας μετὰ τὸ ἐξελθεῖν αὐτόν, καὶ ἀμνὸν ἐνιαύσιον ἄμωμον ποιήσει ὁλοκαύτωμα, καθ’ ἡμέραν τῷ Κυρίῳ, πρωῒ πρωῒ ποιήσει αὐτόν,
¹⁴ καὶ Μαναὰ ποιήσει ἐπ’ αὐτῷ· τοπρωῒ ἕκτον τοῦ μέτρου, καὶ ἐλαίου τὸ τρίτον τοῦ εἶν τοῦ ἀναμίξαι τὴν σεμίδαλιν Μαναὰ τῷ Κυρίῳ,
¹⁵ πρόσταγμα αἰώνιον διὰ παντὸς ποιήσετε τὸν ἀμνόν· καὶ τὸ Μαναὰ καὶ τὸ ἔλαιον ποιήσετε πρωΐ, ὁλοκαύτωμα διὰ παντός.
¹⁶ Τάδε λέγει ᾿Αδωναῖ Κύριος· ἐὰν δῷ ὁ ἀφηγούμενος δόμα ἑνὶ ἐκ τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ τοῦ ἐκ τῆς κληρονομίας αὐτοῦ, τοῦτο τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ ἔσται· κατάσχεσις αὐτῶν αὕτη ἐν κληρονομίᾳ.
¹⁷ Ἐὰν δὲ δῷ δόμα ἐκ τῆς κληρονομίας αὐτοῦ ἑνὶ τῶν παίδων αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔσται αὐτῷ ἕως τοῦ ἔτους τῆς ἀφέσεως, καὶ ἀποδώσει τῷ ἀφηγουμένῳ· πλὴν τῆς κληρονομίας τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ αὐτοῖς ἔσται,
¹⁸ καὶ οὐ μὴ λάβῃ ὁ ἀφηγούμενος ἐκ τῆς κληρονομίας τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ τοῦ καταδυναστεῦσαι αὐτούς, ἐκ τῆς κατασχέσεως αὐτῶν· ἀπὸ τῆς κληρονομίας αὐτοῦ κατακληρονομήσει τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ, ὅπως μὴ διασκορπίζηται ὁ λαός μου, ἕκαστος ἀπὸ τῆς κατασχέσεως αὐτοῦ.
¹⁹ Καὶ εἰσήγαγέ με εἰς τὴν εἴσοδον τῆς κατὰ νότου τῆς πύλης, εἰς τὴν ἐξέδραν τῶν ἁγίων τῶν ἱερέων, τὴν βλέπουσαν πρὸς βορρᾶν· καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐκεῖ

**Chapter 46**

⁸ ...of the gate, [even] of the gate shall he enter, and by the way of the gate shall he go forth.
⁹ And it shall come to pass, when the people of the land shall enter before the Lord in the solemn feasts, that he that entereth by the way of the gate toward the north to worship, shall go forth by the way of the gate toward the south; and he that entereth by the way of the gate toward the south, shall go forth by the way of the gate toward the north: he shall not return by the gate by which he entered,
¹⁰ but rather he shall go forth straight ahead. And the ruler in the midst of them, when they enter, shall enter with them; and when they go forth, he shall go forth with them.
¹¹ And in the feasts and in the solemn assemblies, there shall be a Man'a [grain] offering for the calf, and a grain offering for the ram and for the lambs, as his hand shall be able to provide, and a hin of oil with the grain offering.
¹² Moreover, if the ruler shall prepare a freewill offering, [even] a burnt offering of peace offering unto the Lord, then shall he open for himself the gate that looketh toward the east, and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings in such wise as he prepareth them on the Sabbath day; and he shall go forth,
¹³ and he shall shut the doors after he hath gone forth. And a lamb of the first year, without blemish, shall he prepare for a burnt offering daily unto the Lord; morning by morning shall he prepare it.
¹⁴ And a Man'a [offering] shall he prepare upon it: in the morning, a sixth part of an ephah, and of oil, the third part of a hin, to mix the fine flour for the Man'a [offering] unto the Lord.
¹⁵ This is a perpetual statute: continually shall ye prepare the lamb; and the Man'a [offering] and the oil shall ye prepare in the morning, a continual burnt offering.
¹⁶ Thus saith Adonai the Lord: If the ruler shall give a gift unto one of his sons, [namely,] one from his inheritance, this [gift] shall be for his sons; this [shall be] their possession as an inheritance.
¹⁷ But if he shall give a gift from his inheritance unto one of his servants, then it shall be his until the year of release; and he shall restore it unto the ruler. Nevertheless, the inheritance of his sons shall be for them.
¹⁸ And the ruler shall not take of the inheritance of his people, to oppress them, from their possession; but from his own inheritance shall he give inheritance unto his sons, that My people be not scattered, each one from his possession.
¹⁹ And he brought me into the entrance of the gate that was toward the south, into the chambers of the holy priests, which looked toward the north; and behold, there [was] a place set apart.
