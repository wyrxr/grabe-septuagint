9 τεκνοποιήσει ὄχλον πολὺν, καὶ ἀποστρέφουσιν ὧδε. Ἐν κλαυθμῷ
ἐξῆλθον, καὶ ἐν παρακλήσει ἀνάξω αὐτοὺς, αὐλίζων ἐπὶ διωρυγὰς
ὑδάτων ἐν ὁδῷ ὀρθῇ, καὶ οὐ μὴ πλανηθῶσιν ἐν αὐτῇ· ὅτι ἐγε-
νόμην τῷ Ἰσραὴλ εἰς πατέρα, καὶ Ἐφραὶμ πρωτότοκός μου ἐστίν.
10 Ἀκούσατε λόγους Κυρίου, ἔθνη, καὶ ἀναγγείλατε εἰς νήσους
τὰς μακράν· εἴπατε, ὁ λικμήσας τὸν Ἰσραὴλ συνάξει αὐτὸν, καὶ
11 φυλάξει αὐτὸν, ὡς ὁ βόσκων τὸ ποίμνιον αὐτοῦ. Ὅτι ἐλυτρώσατο
Κύριος τὸν Ἰακώβ, ἐξειλάτο αὐτὸν ἐκ χειρὸς στερεωτέρων αὐτοῦ.
12 Καὶ ἥξουσι, καὶ εὐφρανθήσονται ἐν τῷ ὄρει Σιὼν, καὶ ἥξουσιν ἐπ᾿
ἀγαθὰ Κυρίου, ἐπὶ γῆν σίτου καὶ οἴνου, καὶ καρπῶν, καὶ κτηνῶν,
καὶ προβάτων· καὶ ἔσται ἡ ψυχὴ αὐτῶν, ὥσπερ ξύλον ἔγκαρπον,
13 καὶ οὐ πεινάσουσιν ἔτι. Τότε χαρήσονται παρθένοι ἐν συναγωγῇ
νεανίσκων, καὶ πρεσβῦται χαρήσονται, καὶ στρέψω τὸ πένθος αὐτῶν
εἰς εὐφροσύνην, καὶ παρακαλέσω αὐτοὺς, καὶ ποιήσω αὐτοὺς
14 εὐφραινομένους. Μεγαλυνῶ καὶ μεθύσω τὴν ψυχὴν τῶν ἱερέων
υἱῶν Λευὶ πιότητος, καὶ ὁ λαός μου τῶν ἀγαθῶν μου ἐμπλησθήσεται,
15 φησὶ Κύριος. Οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος· φωνὴ ἐν Ῥαμᾶ ἠκούσθη θρήνου,
καὶ κλαυθμοῦ, καὶ ὀδυρμοῦ· Ῥαχὴλ ἀποκλαιομένης ἐπὶ τῶν υἱῶν
αὐτῆς, καὶ οὐκ ἤθελε παρακληθῆναι ἐπὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτῆς, ὅτι οὐκ
16 εἰσίν. Οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος· διαλειπέτω ἡ φωνή σου ἀπὸ κλαυθμοῦ,
καὶ οἱ ὀφθαλμοί σου ἀπὸ δακρύων, ὅτι ἐστὶ μισθὸς τοῖς σοῖς ἔργοις,
φησὶ Κύριος, καὶ ἐπιστρέψουσιν ἐκ γῆς ἐχθρῶν· καὶ ἔσται ἐλπὶς τῇ
ἐσχάτῃ σου, καὶ μόνιμον τοῖς σοῖς τέκνοις εἰς τὰ ὅρια αὐτῶν.
18 Ἀκοὴν ἤκουσα Ἐφραὶμ ὀδυρομένου, ἐπαίδευσάς με, καὶ ἐπαιδεύθην·
ἐγὼ ὥσπερ μόσχος οὐκ ἐδιδάχθην·
19 ἐπίστρεψόν με, καὶ ἐπιστρέψω, ὅτι σὺ Κύριος ὁ Θεός μου, ὅτι
ὕστερον αἰχμαλωσίας μου μετενόησα, καὶ ὕστερον τοῦ γνῶναι με,
ἐστέναξα ἐφ᾿ ἡμέρας αἰσχύνης, καὶ ὑπέδειξά σοι, ὅτι ἔλαβον
20 ὀνειδισμὸν ἐκ νεότητός μου. Υἱὸς ἀγαπητὸς Ἐφραὶμ, ἐμοὶ παιδίον
ἐκτρυφῶν, ὅτι ἀνθ᾿ ὧν οἱ λόγοι μου ἐν αὐτῷ, μνεία μνησθήσομαι
αὐτοῦ ἔτι, διὰ τοῦτο ἔσπευσα ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ, ἐλεῶν ἐλεήσω αὐτόν,
21 φησὶ Κύριος. Στῆσον σεαυτὴν Σιὼν, ποίησον σεαυτῇ τιμωρίαν,
δὸς καρδίαν σου εἰς τοὺς ὤμους σου, ὁδὸν, ᾗ ἐπορεύθης, ἀποστράφηθι,
παρθένος θυγάτηρ Ἰσραὴλ, ἀποστράφηθι εἰς τὰς πόλεις σου πενθοῦσα.
22 Ἕως πότε ἀποστρέφεις, θυγάτηρ ἡτιμωμένη; ὅτι ἔκτισε Κύριος
σωτηρίαν εἰς καταφύτευσιν καινὴν, ἐν ᾗ σωτηρία

**JEREMIAH CHAPTER 38 [LXX] (Hebrew Chapter 31)**

**9** And He shall beget a great multitude, and they shall return hither. In weeping did they go forth, and in consolation will I lead them back, causing them to lodge by the watercourses in a straight way, and they shall not stray therein; for I am become a Father unto Israel, and Ephraim is My firstborn.
**10** Hearken ye the words of the Lord, O nations, and declare them unto the islands afar off; say ye, "He that hath scattered Israel shall gather him, and shall keep him, as a shepherd keepeth his flock."
**11** For the Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and delivered him from the hand of those that were stronger than he.
**12** And they shall come, and shall rejoice on Mount Zion, and they shall come unto the good things of the Lord, unto a land of corn and wine, and of fruits, and of cattle, and of sheep; and their soul shall be as a fruitful tree, and they shall hunger no more.
**13** Then shall the virgins rejoice in the assembly of young men, and the elders shall rejoice; and I shall turn their mourning into gladness, and I shall comfort them, and I shall make them rejoice.
**14** I shall magnify and satisfy abundantly the soul of the priests, the sons of Levi, with richness, and My people shall be filled with My good things, saith the Lord.
**15** Thus saith the Lord: "A voice was heard in Ramah, of lamentation, and of weeping, and of mournful cries; Rachel weeping for her children, and she would not be comforted for her children, because they are no more."
**16** Thus saith the Lord: "Let thy voice cease from weeping, and thine eyes from tears; for there is a reward for thy works, saith the Lord, and they shall return from the land of their enemies; and there shall be hope for thy latter end, and a lasting [heritage] for thy children within their own borders."
**18** I have surely heard Ephraim lamenting: "Thou hast chastised me, and I was disciplined; I am as a calf that was not trained;
**19** turn Thou me, and I shall be turned, for Thou art the Lord my God. For after my captivity I repented, and after I understood, I groaned for the days of shame, and I showed Thee that I received
**20** reproach from my youth." "Is Ephraim a beloved son unto Me? Is he a pampered child? For as often as My words are in him, I shall yet surely remember him; therefore have I yearned for him, I will surely have mercy upon him," saith the Lord.
**21** "Set thyself up, O Zion, make unto thyself waymarks; turn thy heart toward thy shoulders, [to recall] the way by which thou wentest; turn back, O virgin daughter of Israel, turn back to thy cities, sorrowing."
**22** "How long wilt thou turn away, O dishonored daughter? For the Lord hath created salvation for a new planting, in which salvation..."
