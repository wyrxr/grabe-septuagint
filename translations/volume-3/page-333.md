συνετρίβη, ὀλόλυζον καὶ κέκραζον, ἀνάγγειλον ἐν Ἀερνῶν, ὅτι
ὤλετο Μωάβ, καὶ κρίσις ἔρχεται εἰς τὴν γῆν τοῦ Μεισὼρ ἐπὶ Χελών, 21
καὶ ἐπὶ Ῥεφάς, καὶ Μωράς, καὶ ἐπὶ Δαιβών, καὶ ἐπὶ Ναβαῦ, 22
καὶ ἐπ᾿ οἶκον Δεβλαθαίμ, καὶ ἐπὶ Καριθαίμ, καὶ ἐπὶ οἶκον Γαιμώλ, 23
καὶ ἐπ᾿ οἶκον Μαών, καὶ ἐπὶ Καριώθ, καὶ ἐπὶ Βοσόρ, καὶ 24
ἐπὶ πάσας τὰς πόλεις γῆς Μωάβ τὰς πόῤῥω καὶ τὰς ἐγγύς. Κατεάχθη 25
κέρας Μωάβ, καὶ τὸ ἐπίχειρον αὐτοῦ συνετρίβη, φησὶ Κύριος.
Μεθύσατε αὐτόν, ὅτι ἐπὶ Κύριον ἐμεγαλύνθη· καὶ ἐπικρούσει 26
Μωάβ ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔσται εἰς γέλωτα καὶ αὐτός. Καὶ 27
εἰ μὴ εἰς γελοιασμὸν ἦν σοι Ἰσραήλ, εἰ ἐν κλοπαῖς σου εὑρέθη,
ὅτι ἐπολέμεις αὐτόν, μεταναστεύσεις. Κατέλιπον τὰς πόλεις, καὶ 28
ὤκησαν ἐν πέτραις οἰκοῦντες Μωάβ· ἐγενήθησαν ὡς περιστεραὶ
νοσσεύουσαι ἐν πέτραις βόθυνου στόματι. Ἤκουσα ὕβριν Μωάβ, 29
(ὕβρισε σφόδρα) τὸ ὕψος αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὴν ὕβριν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὑπερηφανίαν
αὐτοῦ· καὶ ὑψώθη ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ, ἐγὼ δὲ ἔγνων τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ, 30
φησὶ Κύριος· οὐχὶ τὸ ἱκανὸν αὐτοῦ οὐχ οὕτως ἐποίησε ; Διὰ τοῦτο 31
ἐπὶ Μωάβ ὀλολύζετε πάντοθεν· βοήσατε ἐπ᾿ ἄνδρας Κειράδας
αἰχμοῦ. Ὡς κλαυθμὸν Ἰαζὴρ ἀποκλαύσομαί σοι, ἄμπελος Ἅσερημά, 32
κλήματά σου διῆλθε θάλασσαν, πόλεις Ἰαζὴρ ἥψαντο, ἐπὶ
ὁπώραν σου καὶ ἐπὶ τρυγηταῖς σου ὄλεθρος ἔπεσε. Συνεψήσθη 33
χαρμοσύνη καὶ εὐφροσύνη ἐκ τῆς Μωαβίτιδος, καὶ οἶνος ἦν ἐπὶ ληνοῖς
σου· πρωὶ οὐκ ἐπάτησαν, οὐδὲ δείλης οὐκ ἐποίησαν Αἰδέ. Ἀπὸ 34
κραυγῆς Ἐσεβὼν ἕως Ἐλεαλὴ καὶ ἕως Ἰασσὰ αἱ πόλεις αὐτῶν
ἔδωκαν φωνὴν αὐτῶν ἀπὸ Ζογὸρ ἕως Ὡρωναίμ, καὶ Ἀγγελία Σαλισία,
ὅτι καὶ τὸ ὕδωρ Νεβρείμ εἰς κατάκαυμα ἔσται. Καὶ ἀπολῶ 35
τὸν Μωάβ, φησὶ Κύριος, ἀναβαίνοντα ἐπὶ τὸν βωμόν, καὶ θυμιῶντα
θεοῖς αὐτοῦ. Διὰ τοῦτο καρδία τοῦ Μωάβ, ὥσπερ αὐλοὶ 36
βομβήσουσι, καὶ καρδία μου ἐπ᾿ ἀνθρώπους Κειράδας ὥσπερ αὐλὸς
βομβήσει· διὰ τοῦτο, ἃ περιεποιήσατο, ἀπώλετο ἀπὸ ἀνθρώπου.
Πᾶσαν κεφαλὴν ἐν παντὶ τόπῳ ξυρήσονται, καὶ πᾶς πώγων 37
ξυρηθήσεται, καὶ πᾶσαι χεῖρες κόψονται, καὶ ἐπὶ πάσης ὀσφύος
σάκκος. Καὶ ἐπὶ πάντων τῶν δωμάτων Μωάβ, καὶ ἐπὶ πλατείας 38
αὐτῆς ὅλαις κοπετόν, ὅτι συνέτριψα, φησὶ Κύριος, τὸν Μωάβ
ὡς ἀγγεῖον, οὗ οὐκ ἔστι χρεία αὐτοῦ. Πῶς κατήλλαξε; 39
ὀλολύξατε· πῶς ἔστρεψε νῶτον Μωάβ; ἠισχύνθη, καὶ ἐγένετο
Μωάβ εἰς γέλωτα, καὶ ἐγκότημα πᾶσι τοῖς κύκλῳ αὐτῆς. Ὄτι 40

**Jeremiah, Chapter 31**
(Corresponding to Hebrew Chapter 48)

**20** he is broken. Wail ye and cry out; declare ye in Aernon, that
Moab is destroyed, and judgment cometh upon the land of Meisor,
**21** upon Chelon, and upon Rephas, and Moras, and upon Dibon, and upon Nebo,
**22** and upon the house of Diblathaim, and upon Kirjathaim, and upon the house of Gamul,
**23** and upon the house of Maon, and upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah,
**24** and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, both the far and the near.
**25** The horn of Moab is broken down, and his arm is shattered, saith the Lord.
**26** Make ye him drunken, for against the Lord hath he magnified himself;
and Moab shall strike upon his vomit with his hand, and he himself shall become a derision.
**27** And was not Israel a derision unto thee? Was he found among thy thieves,
for that thou didst fight against him? Thou shalt wander away.
**28** They have forsaken the cities, and they that dwell in Moab have made their abode in the rocks;
they are become as doves nesting in the rocks, in the mouth of a chasm.
**29** I have heard the insolence of Moab, (he hath been exceeding insolent),
his height, and his insolence, and his pride; and his heart was lifted up.
**30** But I have known his works, saith the Lord. Verily, his vaunting is not so; for hath he not done thus?
**31** Therefore, howl ye for Moab on every side; cry aloud for the men of Kir-Heresh, [those who fall by the] spear.
**32** As the weeping of Jazer, I will weep for thee, O vine of Haserehma;
thy branches have passed over the sea, the cities of Jazer have touched [them].
**33** Upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage, destruction hath fallen.
Joy and gladness have been consumed from the land of Moab;
and wine was upon thy winepresses; in the morning they did not tread [them],
neither in the evening did they make Aide.
**34** From the cry of Heshbon unto Elealeh, and unto Jahaz, their cities have given forth their voice,
from Zoar even unto Horonaim, and the message of Salisia,
that even the water of Nebreim shall be for a burning.
**35** And I will destroy Moab, saith the Lord, [even him that] goeth up upon the altar,
and offereth incense unto his gods.
**36** Therefore the heart of Moab shall moan like flutes, and my heart for the men of Kir-Heresh
shall moan like a flute; therefore, that which he hath acquired is perished from man.
**37** Every head in every place shall be shaven, and every beard shall be shaven;
and all hands shall smite [themselves], and upon every loin, sackcloth.
**38** And upon all the housetops of Moab, and in all its streets, there shall be a wailing,
for I have broken Moab, saith the Lord, as a vessel wherein there is no use.
**39** How is he brought to ruin? Howl ye! How hath Moab turned his back? He is put to shame.
And Moab is become a derision, and a consternation unto all them that are round about her.
**40** For
