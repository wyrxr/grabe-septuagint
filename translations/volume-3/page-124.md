ΥΜΝ. ΙΑ΄. ΧΙ.

46 ΠΡΟΣΕΥΧΗ Μαρίας τῆς θεοτόκου. Μεγαλύνει ἡ ψυχή μου
47 τὸν Κύριον, καὶ ἠγαλλίασε τὸ πνεῦμά μου ἐπὶ τῷ Θεῷ τῷ
48 σωτῆρί μου. Ὅτι ἐπέβλεψεν ἐπὶ τὴν ταπείνωσιν τῆς δούλης αὑ-
49 τοῦ· ἰδοὺ γὰρ ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν μακαριοῦσί με πᾶσαι αἱ γενεαί. Ὅτι
50 ἐποίησέ μοι μεγαλεῖα ὁ δυνατός· καὶ ἅγιον τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ. Καὶ
51 τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ εἰς γενεὰς γενεῶν τοῖς φοβουμένοις αὐτόν. Ἐποίησε
52 κράτος ἐν βραχίονι αὐτοῦ· διεσκόρπισεν ὑπερηφάνους διανοίᾳ καρ-
53 δίας αὐτῶν. Καθεῖλε δυνάστας ἀπὸ θρόνων, καὶ ὕψωσε ταπει-
54 νοῦς. Πεινῶντας ἐνέπλησεν ἀγαθῶν, καὶ πλουτοῦντας ἐξαπέστει-
55 λε κενούς. Ἀντελάβετο Ἰσραὴλ παιδὸς αὐτοῦ, μνησθῆναι ἐλέους

**THE PRAYER OF MARY THE THEOTOKOS.**

**46** My soul doth magnify the Lord,
**47** And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Savior.
**48** For He hath regarded the low estate of His handmaiden;
**49** For, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.
**50** For He that is mighty hath done great things for me, and holy is His Name.
**51** And His mercy is on them that fear Him, from generation to generation.
**52** He hath showed strength with His arm;
He hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.
**53** He hath put down the mighty from their seats,
And hath exalted them of low degree.
**54** He hath filled the hungry with good things,
And the rich He hath sent empty away.
**55** He hath helped His servant Israel,
In remembrance of His mercy.
