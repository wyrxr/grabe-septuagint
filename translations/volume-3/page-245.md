ΚΕΦ. ΜΔ΄.                 Η Σ Α Ι                 1183
**9** ...καὶ γλύφοντες, πάντες μάταιοι, οἱ ποιοῦντες τὰ καταθύμια
αὐτῶν, ἃ οὐκ ὠφελήσει αὐτούς· καὶ μάρτυρες αὐτῶν εἰσίν, οὐκ
ἔζονται, καὶ οὐ γνώσονται, ἀλλὰ αἰσχυνθήσονται, πάντες οἱ
**10** πλάσσοντες θεόν, καὶ γλύφοντες ἀνωφελῆ. καὶ πάντες, ὅθεν ἐγένετο,
**11** ἐξηράνθησαν· καὶ κωφοὶ ἀπὸ ἀνθρώπων συναχθήτωσαν
πάντες, καὶ στησάτωσαν ἅμα· ἐντραπήτωσαν, καὶ αἰσχυνθή-
τωσαν ἅμα·
**12** ὅτι ὤξυνε τέκτων σίδηρον, σκεπάρνῳ εἰργάσατο
αὐτὸ ἐν ἄνθραξι, καὶ ἐν τερέτρῳ ἔστησεν αὐτό, καὶ εἰργάσατο
αὐτὸ ἐν τῷ βραχίονι τῆς ἰσχύος αὐτοῦ· καὶ πεινάσει, καὶ ἀ-
σθενήσει, καὶ οὐ μὴ πίῃ ὕδωρ.
**13** Ἐκλεξάμενος τέκτων ξύλον,
ἔστησεν αὐτὸ ἐν μέτρῳ, καὶ ἐν κόλλῃ ἐῤῥύθμισεν αὐτό· ἐποίη-
σεν αὐτὸ ἐν παραγωνίσκοις, καὶ ἐμόρφωσεν αὐτὸ ἐν παραγρα-
φίδι· καὶ ἐποίησεν αὐτὸ ὡς μορφὴν ἀνδρός, καὶ ὡς ὡραιότητα
ἀνθρώπου, στῆσαι αὐτὸ ἐν οἴκῳ.
**14** (Ὃ ἔκοψεν ἑαυτῷ κέδρους,
καὶ ἔλαβεν ἀγριοβάλανον καὶ δρῦν, καὶ ἐκαρτέρωσεν ἑαυτῷ ξύ-
λον ἐκ τοῦ δρυμοῦ, ὃ ἐφύτευσε Κύριος, πίτυν, καὶ ὑετὸς ἐμή-
κυνεν, ἵνα ᾖ ἀνθρώποις εἰς καῦσιν,
**15** καὶ λαβὼν ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ, ἐθερ-
μάνθη, καὶ καύσαντες ἔπεψαν ἄρτους ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῦ, τὸ δὲ λοιπὸν
εἰργάσατο εἰς θεούς, καὶ προσκυνοῦσιν αὐτοῖς· ἐποίησεν αὐτὸ
γλυπτόν, καὶ κάμπτει αὐτοῖς.
**16** οὗ τὸ ἥμισυ αὐτοῦ κατέκαυσεν
ἐν πυρί, καὶ ἐπὶ τοῦ ἡμίσους αὐτοῦ καύσαντες ἔπεψαν ἄρτους
ἐπ᾿ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῦ κρέας ὀπτήσας ὀπτὸν ἔφαγε, καὶ ἐ-
νεπλήσθη, καὶ θερμανθεὶς εἶπεν· Ἡδὺ μοι, ὅτι ἐθερμάνθην, καὶ
ἴδον πῦρ.
**17** Τὸ δὲ λοιπὸν αὐτοῦ ἐποίησεν εἰς θεὸν γλυπτόν, καὶ
προσκυνεῖ αὐτῷ, καὶ προσεύχεται λέγων, ἔξελοῦ με, ὅτι Θεός
μου εἶ σύ.
**18** Οὐκ ἔγνωσαν φρονῆσαι ὅτι ἀπημαυρώθησαν τοῦ βλέπειν
τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτῶν, καὶ τοῦ νοῆσαι τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτῶν.
**19** Καὶ οὐκ ἐλογίσατο τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ, (οὐδὲ ἂν ἐλογίσατο ἐν τῇ
ψυχῇ αὐτοῦ,) οὐδὲ ἔγνω τῇ φρονήσει, ὅτι τὸ ἥμισυ αὐτοῦ κα-
τέκαυσεν ἐν πυρί, καὶ ἔπεψεν ἐπὶ τῶν ἀνθράκων αὐτοῦ ἄρτους,
καὶ ὀπτήσας κρέας ἔφαγε, καὶ τὸ λοιπὸν αὐτοῦ εἰς βδέλυγμα
ἐποίησε, καὶ προσκυνοῦσιν αὐτῷ.
**20** Γνῶθι, ὅτι σποδὸς ἡ καρδία
αὐτῶν, καὶ πλανῶνται, καὶ οὐδεὶς δύναται ἐξελέσθαι τὴν ψυ-
χὴν αὐτοῦ· ἴδετε, οὐκ ἐρεῖτε, ὅτι ψεῦδος ἐν τῇ δεξιᾷ μου.
**21** Μνήσθητι ταῦτα, Ἰακὼβ καὶ Ἰσραήλ, ὅτι παῖς μου εἶ σύ,
**22** ἔπλασά σε παῖδά μου, καὶ σύ, Ἰσραήλ, μὴ ἐπιλανθάνου μου.
Ἰδοὺ γὰρ

#### Chapter 44

**9** ...and carvers. All are vanity,
    those who fashion their cherished [idols],
    which shall not profit them;
    and their witnesses, they shall not live,
    neither shall they know,
    but they shall be put to shame.
**10** All they that fashion a god,
    and carve unprofitable things.
**11** And all, from whence it was made, are withered.
    And let the deaf among men be gathered, every one,
    and let them stand forth together;
    let them be ashamed, and let them be confounded together.
**12** For the craftsman sharpeneth iron;
    with an axe hath he wrought it in the coals,
    and with a drill hath he made it stand fast,
    and with the arm of his strength hath he fashioned it.
    Yet shall he hunger, and be faint,
    neither shall he drink water.
**13** The carpenter, having chosen a tree,
    hath set it according to measure,
    and with glue hath he shaped it;
    he hath fashioned it with planes,
    and hath formed it with a marking tool;
    and he hath made it as the figure of a man,
    and as the comeliness of a human being,
    to set it up in a house.
**14** (He himself hath cut down cedars,
    and hath taken the wild oak and the oak,
    and hath waited patiently for himself wood from the forest,
    even that which the Lord did plant, the pine tree,
    and the rain did nourish it,
    that it might be for men for burning;
**15** And having taken thereof, he hath warmed himself,
    and by burning it, they have baked bread thereon.
    But the residue he hath fashioned into gods,
    and they bow down to them;
    he hath made it a graven image,
    and prostrateth himself before them.
**16** Whereof the half of it he hath consumed with fire,
    and upon the [other] half of it, having kindled a fire,
    they have baked bread upon them;
    and upon it, having roasted meat,
    he hath eaten [it] roasted, and is filled;
    and being warmed, he said, "It is pleasant unto me,
    for I have been warmed, and have seen the fire."
**17** And the residue thereof he hath made a graven god,
    and boweth down to it,
    and prayeth, saying, "Deliver me,
    for Thou art my God."
**18** They have not known to understand,
    for their eyes have been darkened from seeing,
    and their heart from perceiving.
**19** And he hath not taken thought in his heart,
    (neither would he have taken thought in his soul,)
    neither hath he known by discernment,
    that the half thereof he hath consumed with fire,
    and hath baked bread upon its coals,
    and having roasted meat, he hath eaten;
    and the residue thereof he hath made an abomination,
    and they worship it.
**20** Know ye, that their heart is ashes,
    and they wander astray;
    and no man is able to deliver his soul.
    [Therefore], ye shall not say, "A falsehood is in My right hand."
**21** Remember these things, O Jacob and Israel,
    for thou art My servant,
**22** I have fashioned thee [to be] My servant;
    and thou, O Israel, forget Me not.
    For behold,
