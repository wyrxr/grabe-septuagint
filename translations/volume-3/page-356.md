6 οἴνου καὶ ποτήρια, καὶ εἶπα· πίετε οἶνον. Καὶ εἶπαν· οὐ πίομεν
οἶνον, ὅτι Ἰωναδάβ, υἱὸς Ῥηχάβ, ὁ πατὴρ ἡμῶν ἐνετείλατο ἡμῖν, εἴ-
7 πας· οὐ μὴ πίητε οἶνον ὑμεῖς, καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ ὑμῶν ἕως αἰῶνος· καὶ οἰκίας
οὐ μὴ οἰκοδομήσητε, καὶ σπέρμα οὐ μὴ σπείρητε, καὶ ἀμπελῶνα μὴ
φυτεύσητε, μηδὲ ἔστω ὑμῖν· ὅτι ἐν σκηναῖς κατοικήσετε πάσας τὰς ἡ-
μέρας (τῆς ζωῆς) ὑμῶν, ὅπως ἂν ζήτε ἡμέρας πολλὰς ἐπὶ τῆς
8 γῆς, ἐφ᾿ ἧς διατρίβετε ὑμεῖς ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς. Καὶ εἰσηκούσαμεν τῆς
φωνῆς Ἰωναδάβ τοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν, κατὰ πάντα, ὅσα ἐνετείλατο
ἡμῖν, πρὸς τὸ μὴ πιεῖν οἶνον πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας (τῆς ζωῆς) ἡμῶν,
ἡμεῖς καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες ἡμῶν, καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ ἡμῶν, καὶ αἱ θυγατέρες
9 ἡμῶν, καὶ πρὸς τὸ μὴ οἰκοδομεῖν οἰκίας τοῦ κατοικεῖν ἐκεῖ· καὶ
10 ἀμπελῶν, καὶ ἀγρός, καὶ σπέρμα οὐκ ἐγένετο ἡμῖν· καὶ ᾠκή-
σαμεν ἐν σκηναῖς, καὶ ἠκούσαμεν, καὶ ἐποιήσαμεν κατὰ πάντα,
11 ὅσα ἐνετείλατο ἡμῖν Ἰωναδάβ ὁ πατὴρ ἡμῶν. Καὶ ἐγενήθη,
ὅτε ἀνέβη Ναβουχοδονόσορ βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν,
καὶ εἴπαμεν· ἀναβάντες εἰσελευσόμεθα εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἀπὸ προ-
σώπου τῆς δυνάμεως τῶν Χαλδαίων, καὶ ἀπὸ προσώπου τῆς δυ-
12 νάμεως τῶν Ἀσσυρίων, καὶ ᾠκήσαμεν ἐκεῖ. Καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος
13 Κυρίου πρὸς με, λέγων· οὕτως λέγει Κύριος τῶν δυνάμεων,
ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ· πορεύου, καὶ εἰπὸν ἀνθρώπῳ Ἰούδα, καὶ
τοῖς κατοικοῦσιν ἐν Ἱεροσολύμοις· οὐ μὴ λάβητε παιδείαν ἀκούειν
14 τοὺς λόγους μου; φησὶ Κύριος. Ἔστησαν ἔρημα υἱοὶ Ἰωναδάβ,
υἱοῦ Ῥηχάβ, ὃ ἐνετείλατο τοῖς τέκνοις αὐτοῦ, πρὸς τὸ μὴ
πιεῖν οἶνον, καὶ οὐκ ἔπιον ἕως ἡμέρας ταύτης, ὅτι ἤκουσαν
τῆς ἐντολῆς τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῶν· κἀγὼ ἐλάλησα πρὸς ὑμᾶς ὄρθρου,
15 ὀρθρίζων καὶ λαλῶν, καὶ οὐκ εἰσηκούσατε. Καὶ ἀπέστειλα πρὸς
ὑμᾶς τοὺς δούλους μου τοὺς προφήτας, ὀρθρίζων καὶ ἀποστέλ-
λων, καὶ λέγων· ἀποστράφητε ἕκαστος ἀπὸ τῆς ὁδοῦ αὐτοῦ
τῆς πονηρᾶς, καὶ βέλτιον ποιήσατε ἐπιτηδεύματα ὑμῶν, καὶ
οὐ πορεύεσθε ὀπίσω θεῶν ἀλλοτρίων τοῦ δουλεύειν αὐτοῖς, καὶ
οἰκήσετε ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, ἧς ἔδωκα ὑμῖν καὶ τοῖς πατράσιν ὑμῶν·
16 καὶ οὐκ ἐκλίνατε τὰ ὦτα ὑμῶν, καὶ οὐκ ἠκούσατε. Καὶ ἔστη-
σαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰωναδάβ υἱοῦ Ῥηχάβ τὴν ἐντολὴν τοῦ πατρὸς αὐ-
τῶν, ἣν ἐνετείλατο αὐτοῖς· ὁ δὲ λαός (μου) οὕτως οὐκ ἤκουσαν
17 μου. Διὰ τοῦτο οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος τῶν δυνάμεων ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσ-
ραήλ· Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ φέρω ἐπὶ Ἰούδαν καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας

**JEREMIAH 42 (Septuagint) / JEREMIAH 35 (Hebrew)**

**6** [of] wine and cups; and I said, "Drink ye wine." And they said, "We will not drink wine; for Jonadab, the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying:
**7** 'Ye shall not drink wine, neither ye, nor your sons, for ever; and ye shall not build houses, neither shall ye sow seed, nor plant vineyard, neither shall there be [any such] for you; for in tents shall ye dwell all the days [of your lives], that ye may live many days upon the land wherein ye sojourn.'
**8** And we hearkened unto the voice of Jonadab our father in all things, whatsoever he commanded us, not to drink wine all the days [of our lives], neither we, nor our wives, nor our sons, nor our daughters;
**9** and not to build houses wherein to dwell;
**10** and neither vineyard, nor field, nor seed had we; but we have dwelt in tents, and have hearkened and done according to all
**11** whatsoever Jonadab our father commanded us. And it came to pass, when Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon came up against the land, that we said, 'Let us go up and enter into Jerusalem, from the face of the power of the Chaldeans, and from the face of the power of the Assyrians.' And so we dwelt there."
**12** Then came the word of the Lord unto me, saying,
**13** "Thus saith the Lord of Powers, the God of Israel: 'Go and say unto the man of Judah, and to those who dwell in Jerusalem, "Will ye not receive instruction to hearken unto My words?" saith the Lord.
**14** The sons of Jonadab, the son of Rechab, [have abode in] desolate places, [upholding] that which he commanded his children, that they should not drink wine; and they have not drunk [any] until this day, for they hearkened unto the commandment of their father. But I spoke unto you early in the morning,
**15** rising early and speaking; yet ye hearkened not. And I sent unto you My servants the prophets, rising early and sending [them], and saying, 'Turn ye back, every man from his evil way, and make better your practices, and go ye not after alien gods to serve them; and ye shall dwell upon the land which I gave unto you and to your fathers.'
**16** Yet ye inclined not your ears, neither hearkened ye. And the sons of Jonadab, the son of Rechab, have upheld the commandment of their father, which he commanded them; but this people [of Mine] hath not hearkened unto Me.
**17** Therefore thus saith the Lord of Powers, the God of Israel: 'Behold, I shall bring upon Judah and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evils which I have spoken against them;
