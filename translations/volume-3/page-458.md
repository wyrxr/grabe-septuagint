3 χοντα Ῥὼς, Μοσὸχ, καὶ Θοβὲλ, καὶ προφήτευσον ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸν, καὶ εἰπὸν αὐτῷ· τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναὶ Κύριος· Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐπὶ σὲ Γὼγ καὶ
4 ἄρχοντα Ῥὼς, Μοσὸχ, καὶ Θοβὲλ, καὶ περιστρέψω σε, καὶ δώσω χαλινὸν εἰς τὰς σιαγόνας σου, καὶ συνάξω σε, καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν δύναμίν σου, ἵππους καὶ ἱππεῖς ἐνδεδυμένους θώρακας πάντας συναγωγὴ πολλὴ, πέλτας καὶ περικεφαλαίας καὶ μάχαιραι· πάντες αὐτοὶ ἔχοντες.
5 Πέρσαι καὶ Αἰθίοπες, καὶ Λίβυες, καὶ Λυδοὶ πάντες ἐν περικεφαλαίαις καὶ πέλταις,
6 Γομέρ, καὶ πάντες οἱ περὶ αὐτὸν, οἶκος τοῦ Θεργαμὰ, ἀπ᾽ ἐσχάτου βορρᾶ, καὶ πάντες οἱ περὶ αὐτὸν καὶ ἔθνη πολλὰ μετὰ σοῦ.
7 Ἑτοιμάσθητι, καὶ ἑτοίμασον σεαυτὸν σὺ, καὶ πᾶσα ἡ συναγωγή σου, οἱ συνηγμένοι μετὰ σοῦ, καὶ ἔση μοι εἰς προφυλακήν.
8 Ἀφ᾽ ἡμερῶν πλειόνων ἐτῶν ἑτοιμασθήσεται, καὶ ἐπ᾽ ἐσχάτου ἐτῶν ἐλεύσεται, καὶ ἥξει εἰς τὴν γῆν τὴν ἀπεστραμμένην ἀπὸ μαχαίρας, συνηγμένων ἀπὸ ἐθνῶν πολλῶν, ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ, ἥ ἐγενήθη ἔρημος δι᾽ ὅλου, καὶ οὗτος ἐξελήλυθεν ἐκ τῶν ἐθνῶν, καὶ κατοικήσουσιν ἐπ᾽ εἰρήνης ἅπαντες.
9 Καὶ ἀναβήσῃ ὡς ὑετὸς, καὶ ἥξεις ὡς νεφέλη, κατακαλύψαι γῆν, καὶ ἔσῃ σὺ καὶ πάντες οἱ περὶ σὲ, καὶ ἔθνη πολλὰ μετὰ σοῦ.
10 Τάδε λέγει Κύριος Κύριος ὁ Θεός· καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, ἀναβήσεται ῥήματα ἐπὶ τὴν καρδίαν σου, καὶ λογιῇ λογισμοὺς πονηροὺς,
11 καὶ ἐρεῖς· ἀναβήσομαι ἐπὶ γῆν ἀπεριμμένην, ἥξω ἐπὶ ἡσυχάζοντας ἐν ἡσυχίᾳ, καὶ κατοικοῦντας ἐπ᾽ εἰρήνης, πάντας κατοικοῦντας πόλεις, ἐν αἷς οὐχ ὑπάρχει τεῖχος οὐδὲ μοχλοὶ, καὶ θύραι οὐκ εἰσὶν αὐταῖς,
12 προνομεῦσαι προνομὴν, καὶ σκυλεῦσαι σκῦλα, τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι τὴν χεῖρά μου εἰς τὴν ἐρημωμένην ἣ κατῳκίσθη, καὶ ἐπὶ ἔθνος συνηγμένον ἀπὸ ἐθνῶν πολλῶν, πεποιηκότας κτήσεις, κατοικοῦντας ἐπὶ τὸν ὀμφαλὸν τῆς γῆς,
13 Σαβὰ, καὶ Δαιδὰν, καὶ οἱ ἔμποροι Καρχηδόνιοι, καὶ πᾶσαι αἱ κῶμαι αὐτῆς ἐροῦσί σοι· τοῦ προνομεῦσαι εἰς προνομὴν σὺ ἔρχῃ, καὶ σκυλεῦσαι σκῦλα, συνήγαγες συναγωγήν σου, λαβεῖν ἀργύριον καὶ χρυσίον, ἀπενέγκασθαι κτῆσιν τοῦ σκυλεῦσαι σκῦλα.

A free and highly literary translation:

3 And he, [even] he that hath Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, prophesy thou against him, and say unto him:
"Thus saith Adonai the Lord: Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, and
4 [thee, even] ruler of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal;
and I will turn thee back, and put a bridle into thy jaws,
and I will gather thee, and all thy host,
horses and horsemen clothed in mail,
all of them a great assembly,
[bearing] shields and helmets and swords; all of them having [these].
5 Persia, and Cush, and Put, and Lydia,
all of them with helmets and shields;
6 Gomer, and all his bands;
the house of Togarmah from the uttermost parts of the north,
and all his bands, and many nations with thee.
7 Be thou prepared, and prepare thyself,
thou, and all thy company that are assembled with thee;
and be thou unto Me a guard.
8 After many days and years shalt thou be prepared;
and in the last of years shalt thou come,
and thou shalt come unto the land that hath been restored from the sword,
[a land] gathered from many nations, unto the land of Israel,
which was made desolate throughout;
and this [people] hath come forth from among the nations,
and they shall all dwell in peace.
9 And thou shalt come up as a shower,
and thou shalt come as a cloud to cover the land,
thou, and all those with thee, and many nations with thee.
10 Thus saith the Lord God: And it shall come to pass in that day,
that words shall come up upon thy heart,
and thou shalt devise evil thoughts,
11 and thou shalt say: 'I will go up against an unwalled land;
I will come upon them that are at rest, that dwell securely,
all of them dwelling in cities wherein there is no wall, neither bars,
and no gates are to them,
12 to take a spoil, and to carry away a prey;
to turn My hand against the desolate [land] which is now inhabited,
and against a people gathered from many nations,
who have acquired possessions, and dwell upon the navel of the earth;
13 Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Carthage,
and all her villages, shall say unto thee:
"Art thou come to take a spoil? And to carry away a prey?
Hast thou gathered thy company to take silver and gold,
to bear away possessions, [even] for the spoiling of spoils?"'
14 Therefore prophesy, son of man, and say unto Gog:
"Thus saith the Lord God: In that day,
when My people Israel dwelleth safely,
15 shalt thou not be aroused, and come from thy place
out of the uttermost parts of the north,
and many nations with thee? All of them horsemen,"
