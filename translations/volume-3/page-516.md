**28** οἱ Βαβυλώνιοι, ἠγανάκτησαν λίαν καὶ συνεστράφησαν ἐπὶ τὸν βασιλέα, καὶ εἶπον· Ἰουδαῖος γέγονεν ὁ βασιλεύς, τὸν Βὴλ κατέσπασε, καὶ τὸν δράκοντα ἀπέκτεινε, καὶ τοὺς ἱερεῖς κατέσφαξε,
**29** καὶ εἶπαν ἐλθόντες πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα· παράδος ἡμῖν τὸν Δανιήλ,
**30** εἰ δὲ μή, ἀποκτενοῦμέν σε, καὶ τὸν οἶκόν σου, καὶ εἶδεν ὁ βασιλεύς, ὅτι ἐπείγουσιν αὐτὸν σφόδρα, καὶ ἀναγκασθεὶς παρέδωκεν αὐτοῖς τὸν Δανιήλ.
**31** Οἱ δὲ ἐνέβαλον αὐτὸν εἰς τὸν λάκκον τῶν λεόντων,
**32** καὶ ἦν ἐκεῖ ἡμέρας ἕξ. Ἦσαν δὲ ἐν τῷ λάκκῳ ἑπτὰ λέοντες, καὶ ἐδίδοτο αὐτοῖς τὴν ἡμέραν δύο σώματα καὶ δύο πρόβατα·
**33** τότε δὲ οὐκ ἐδόθη αὐτοῖς, ἵνα καταφάγωσι τὸν Δανιήλ· καὶ ἦν ᾿Αμβακοὺμ ὁ προφήτης ἐν τῇ Ἰουδαίᾳ, καὶ οὗτος ἥψησεν ἔψεμα, καὶ ἐνέθρυψεν ἄρτους εἰς σκάφην, καὶ ἐπορεύθη εἰς τὸ πεδίον ἀπενέγκαι τοῖς θερισταῖς.
**34** Καὶ εἶπεν ἄγγελος Κυρίου πρὸς ᾿Αμβακοῦμ· ἀπένεγκε τὸ ἄριστον ὃ ἔχεις εἰς Βαβυλῶνα τῷ Δανιὴλ εἰς τὸν λάκκον τῶν λεόντων.
**35** Καὶ εἶπεν ᾿Αμβακούμ· Κύριε, Βαβυλῶνα οὐχ ἑώρακα, καὶ τὸν λάκκον οὐ γινώσκω ποῦ ἐστι.
**36** Καὶ ἐπελάβετο ὁ ἄγγελος Κυρίου τῆς κορυφῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ βαστάσας τῆς κόμης τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ, ἔθηκεν αὐτὸν εἰς Βαβυλῶνα ἐπάνω τοῦ λάκκου, ἐν τῷ ῥοίζῳ τοῦ πνεύματος αὐτοῦ.
**37** Καὶ ἐβόησεν ᾿Αμβακούμ, λέγων· Δανιὴλ Δανιήλ, λάβε τὸ ἄριστον ὃ ἀπέστειλέ σοι ὁ Θεός.
**38** Καὶ εἶπε Δανιήλ· ἐμνήσθης γάρ μου ὁ Θεός, καὶ οὐκ ἐγκατέλιπες τοὺς ἀγαπῶντάς σε.
**39** Καὶ ἀναστὰς Δανιὴλ ἔφαγεν· ὁ δὲ ἄγγελος τοῦ Θεοῦ ἀπεκατέστησε τὸν ᾿Αμβακοὺμ παραχρῆμα εἰς τὸν τόπον αὐτοῦ.
**40** Ὁ δὲ βασιλεὺς ἦλθε τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ πενθῆσαι τὸν Δανιήλ, καὶ ἦλθεν ἐπὶ τὸν λάκκον, καὶ
**41** ἐνέβλεψε· καὶ ἰδού, Δανιὴλ καθήμενος. Καὶ ἀναβοήσας φωνῇ μεγάλῃ, εἶπε· μέγας εἶ, Κύριε, ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ Δανιήλ, καὶ οὐκ ἔστι πλὴν σοῦ ἄλλος.
**42** Καὶ ἀνέσπασεν αὐτόν, τοὺς δὲ αἰτίους τῆς ἀπωλείας αὐτοῦ ἐνέβαλεν εἰς τὸν λάκκον, καὶ κατεβρώθησαν παραχρῆμα ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ.

**28** When the Babylonians heard [this], they were exceedingly wroth, and gathered themselves together against the king, and said, "The king is become a Jew! He hath cast down Bel, and hath slain the dragon, and hath put the priests to the sword!"
**29** And they came and spake unto the king, saying, "Deliver Daniel unto us,
**30** else will we slay thee and thy house." And when the king saw that they pressed him sore, being constrained, he delivered Daniel unto them.
**31** And they cast him into the lions' den,
**32** and he was there six days. Now in the den there were seven lions, and they were accustomed to be given two bodies and two sheep daily;
**33** but at that time naught was given unto them, that they might devour Daniel. Now Habakkuk the prophet was in Judea; and he had boiled pottage, and had broken bread into a bowl, and was gone into the field to bear [it] unto the reapers.
**34** And an angel of the Lord said unto Habakkuk, "Carry the meal which thou hast into Babylon, unto Daniel, into the lions' den."
**35** And Habakkuk said, "O Lord, I have never seen Babylon, neither know I where the den is."
**36** And the angel of the Lord took hold of him by the crown of his head, and, bearing him by the hair of his head, set him in Babylon, upon the den, with the rushing of his spirit.
**37** And Habakkuk cried, saying, "O Daniel, Daniel, take the meal which God hath sent thee!"
**38** And Daniel said, "For Thou, O God, hast remembered me, and hast not forsaken them that love Thee."
**39** And Daniel arose, and did eat. And the angel of God straightway restored Habakkuk unto his own place.
**40** And the king came on the seventh day to mourn for Daniel; and he came unto the den, and
**41** looked in; and behold, Daniel was sitting. And he cried out with a loud voice, and said, "Great art Thou, O Lord, O God of Daniel, and there is none other beside Thee!"
**42** And he drew him forth; but them that were the cause of his destruction he cast into the den, and they were straightway devoured before him.
