**ΚΕΦ. ΝΕ΄. LV.**
**13.** ἀναβήσεται κυπάρισσος, ἀντὶ δὲ τῆς κονύζης ἀναβήσεται μυρσίνη˙ καὶ ἔσται Κύριος εἰς ὄνομα, καὶ εἰς σημεῖον αἰώνιον, καὶ οὐκ ἐκλείψει.

**ΚΕΦ. Νϛ΄. LVI.**
**1.** ΤΑΔΕ λέγει Κύριος· φυλάσσεσθε κρίσιν, καὶ ποιήσατε δικαιοσύνην, ἤγγισε γὰρ τὸ σωτήριόν μου παραγίνεσθαι, καὶ τὸ
**2.** ἔλεός μου ἀποκαλυφθῆναι. Μακάριος ἀνὴρ ὁ ποιῶν ταῦτα, καὶ ἄνθρωπος ὁ ἀντεχόμενος αὐτῶν, καὶ φυλάσσων τὰ σάββατα μὴ βεβηλοῦν, καὶ διατηρῶν τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ μὴ ποιεῖν ἀδίκημα.
**3.** Μὴ λεγέτω ὁ ἀλλογενὴς ὁ προσκείμενος πρὸς Κύριον, λέγων· ἀφορισμῷ ἀφοριεῖ με ἄρα Κύριος ἀπὸ τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ· καὶ μὴ λεγέτω ὁ εὐνοῦχος, ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι ξύλον ξηρόν.
**4.** Ὅτι τάδε λέγει Κύριος τοῖς εὐνούχοις, ὅσοι ἂν φυλάξωνται τὰ σάββατά μου, καὶ ἐκλέξωνται ἃ ἐγὼ θέλω, καὶ ἀντέχωνται τῆς διαθήκης
**5.** μου, δώσω αὐτοῖς ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ μου, καὶ ἐν τῷ τείχει μου τόπον ὀνομαστόν, κρείττω υἱῶν καὶ θυγατέρων, ὄνομα αἰώνιον δώσω αὐτοῖς, καὶ οὐκ ἐκλείψει.
**6.** Καὶ τοῖς ἀλλογενέσι τοῖς προσκειμένοις πρὸς Κύριον δουλεύειν αὐτῷ, καὶ ἀγαπᾶν τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου, τοῦ εἶναι αὐτῷ εἰς δούλους καὶ δούλας, καὶ πάντας τοὺς φυλασσομένους τὰ σάββατά μου μὴ βεβηλοῦν, καὶ ἀντεχομένους τῆς
**7.** διαθήκης μου, εἰσάξω αὐτοὺς εἰς τὸ ὄρος τὸ ἅγιον μου, καὶ εὐφρανῶ αὐτοὺς ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τῆς προσευχῆς μου· τὰ ὁλοκαυτώματα αὐτῶν, καὶ αἱ θυσίαι αὐτῶν ἔσονται δεκταὶ ἐπὶ τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου μου· ὁ γὰρ οἶκός μου οἶκος προσευχῆς κληθήσεται πᾶσι τοῖς
**8.** ἔθνεσιν· εἶπε Κύριος ὁ συνάγων τοὺς διεσπαρμένους Ἰσραήλ, ὅτι συνάξω ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν συναγωγήν.
**9.** Πάντα τὰ θηρία τὰ ἄγρια, δεῦτε, φάγετε πάντα τὰ θηρία τοῦ δρυμοῦ.
**10.** Ἴδετε ὅτι πάντες ἐκτετύφλωνται, οὐκ ἔγνωσαν φρονῆσαι, πάντες κύνες ἔνεοι οὐ δυνήσονται ὑλακτεῖν, ἐνυπνιαζόμενοι κοίτην, φιλοῦντες νυστάξαι.
**11.** Καὶ οἱ κύνες ἀναιδεῖς τῇ ψυχῇ, οὐκ εἰδότες πλησμονήν· καὶ εἰσὶ πονηροὶ οὐκ εἰδότες σύνεσιν, πάντες ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὐτῶν ἐξηκολούθησαν, ἕκαστος κατὰ τὸ ἑαυτοῦ ἀπ᾿ ἄκρου αὐτοῦ.
**12.** Δεῦτε, λάβωμεν οἶνον, καὶ οἰνοφλυγήσωμεν μέθην, καὶ ἔσται τοιαῦτα ἡμέρα αὔριον, μεγάλη περισσῶς σφόδρα.

#### Chapter 55 (Continued)

**13** ...the cypress tree shall come up,
    and instead of the nettle shall come up the myrtle tree;
    and it shall be to the Lord for a name,
    and for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.

#### Chapter 56

**1** Thus saith the Lord:
    Keep ye judgment, and do righteousness;
    for My salvation is near to come forth,
    and My mercy to be revealed.
**2** Blessed is the man that doeth this,
    and the son of man that layeth hold on them;
    that keepeth the Sabbath from defiling it,
    and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.
**3** Neither let the foreigner, that hath joined himself to the Lord,
    speak, saying, "The Lord hath utterly separated me from His people";
    neither let the eunuch say, "Behold, I am a dry tree."
**4** For thus saith the Lord unto the eunuchs
    that shall keep My Sabbaths,
    and choose the things that please Me,
    and lay hold of My covenant,
**5** Even unto them will I give in My house
    and within My walls a place of renown,
    better than sons and daughters;
    an everlasting name will I give them,
    that shall not be cut off.
**6** Also the foreigners that join themselves to the Lord,
    to serve Him, and to love the name of the Lord,
    to be His servants and handmaids,
    everyone that keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it,
    and layeth hold of My covenant;
**7** Even them will I bring to My holy mountain,
    and make them joyful in My house of prayer;
    their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon Mine altar;
    for My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations.
**8** The Lord God, who gathereth the dispersed of Israel, hath said,
    "Surely I will gather yet others to him, unto his gathering."
**9** All ye wild beasts of the field, come ye,
    devour all ye beasts of the forest.
**10** See ye, for all these are blinded;
    they know not to understand;
    all are dumb dogs, they cannot bark;
    dreaming of lying down, loving to slumber.
**11** And these dogs are shameless in soul,
    knowing no satiety;
    and they are wicked, knowing no understanding;
    all of them have followed in their own ways,
    each one for his own gain from his quarter.
**12** "Come ye," [say they], "let us take wine,
    and let us drink deeply unto drunkenness;
    and tomorrow shall be as this day,
    and much more abundant."
