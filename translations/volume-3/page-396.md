ΚΕΦ. Ε΄. V

**1** ΚΑὶ σὺ υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, λάβε σεαυτῷ ῥομφαίαν ὀξεῖαν ὑπὲρ
    ξυρὸν κουρέως, κτῆσαι αὐτὴν σεαυτῷ, καὶ ἐπάξεις αὐτὴν ἐπὶ
    τὴν κεφαλήν σου, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν πώγωνά σου· καὶ λήψῃ ζυγὸν
**2** σταθμίων, καὶ διαστήσεις αὐτούς, τὸ τέταρτον (τὸ) ἐν πυρὶ ἀνα-
    καύσεις ἐν μέσῃ τῇ πόλει κατὰ τὴν πλήρωσιν τῶν ἡμερῶν τοῦ
    συγκλεισμοῦ· καὶ λήψῃ τὸ τέταρτον, καὶ κατακαύσεις αὐτὸ ἐν
    μέσῳ αὐτῆς, καὶ τὸ τέταρτον κατακόψεις ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ κύκλῳ
    αὐτῆς, καὶ τὸ τέταρτον διασκορπιεῖς τῷ πνεύματι· καὶ μάχαι-
**3** ραν ἐκκενώσω ὀπίσω αὐτῶν. ΚΑὶ λήψῃ ἐκεῖθεν ὀλίγους ἐν ἀριθ-
    μῷ, καὶ συμπεριλήψῃ αὐτοὺς τῇ ἀναβολῇ σου. Καὶ ἐκ τούτων
**4** λήψῃ ἔτι, καὶ ῥίψεις αὐτοὺς εἰς μέσον τοῦ πυρός, καὶ κατα-
    καύσεις αὐτοὺς ἐν πυρί· ἐξ αὐτῆς ἐξελεύσεται πῦρ· καὶ ἐρεῖς
**5** παντὶ οἴκῳ Ἰσραήλ. Τάδε λέγει ᾿Αδωναὶ Κύριος· αὕτη ἡ Ἱε-
    ρουσαλήμ, ἐν μέσῳ τῶν ἐθνῶν τέθεικα αὐτήν, καὶ τὰς κύκλῳ
**6** αὐτῆς χώρας, καὶ ἐρεῖς τὰ δικαιώματά μου τῇ ἀνόμῳ ἐκ τῶν
    ἐθνῶν, καὶ τὰ νόμιμά μου ἐκ τῶν χωρῶν τῶν κύκλῳ αὐτῆς,
    διότι τὰ δικαιώματά μου ἀπώσαντο, καὶ ἐν τοῖς νομίμοις μου
    οὐκ ἐπορεύθησαν ἐν αὐτοῖς.
**7** Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει ᾿Αδωναὶ Κύριος·
    ἀνθ᾿ ὧν ἡ ἀφορμὴ ὑμῶν ἐκ τῶν ἐθνῶν, τῶν κύκλῳ ὑμῶν, καὶ
    ἐν τοῖς νομίμοις μου οὐκ ἐπορεύθητε, καὶ τὰ δικαιώματά μου οὐκ
    ἐποιήσατε, ἀλλ᾿ οὐδὲ κατὰ τὰ δικαιώματα τῶν ἐθνῶν τῶν κύκλῳ
**8** ὑμῶν οὐκ ἐποιήσατε, διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει ᾿Αδωναὶ Κύριος· ἰδοὺ
    ἐγὼ ἐπὶ σέ, καὶ ποιήσω ἐν μέσῳ σου κρῖμα ἐνώπιον τῶν ἐθνῶν,
**9** καὶ ποιήσω ἐν σοὶ ἃ οὐκ ἐποίησα, καὶ ἃ οὐ μὴ ποιήσω ὅμοια
    αὐτοῖς ἔτι κατὰ πάντα τὰ βδελύγματά σου.
**10** Διὰ τοῦτο πατέρες
    φάγονται τέκνα ἐν μέσῳ σου, καὶ τέκνα φάγονται πατέρας· καὶ
    ποιήσω ἐν σοὶ κρίματα, καὶ διασκορπιῶ πάντας τοὺς καταλοίπους
**11** σου εἰς πάντα ἄνεμον. Διὰ τοῦτο ζῶ ἐγώ, λέγει ᾿Αδωναὶ Κύ-
    ριος, εἰ μὴ ἀνθ᾿ ὧν τὰ ἅγιά μου ἐμίανας ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς προσο-
    χθίσμασί σου, καὶ ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς βδελύγμασί σου, καὶ ἐγὼ ἀπώ-
**12** σομαί σε, καὶ οὐ φείσεταί μου ὁ ὀφθαλμός, καὶ ἐγὼ οὐκ ἐλεή-
    σω σε. Τὸ τέταρτόν σου ἐν θανάτῳ ἀναλωθήσεται, καὶ τὸ τέταρ-
    τόν σου ἐν λιμῷ συντελεσθήσεται ἐν μέσῳ σου, καὶ τὸ τέταρτόν

### Chapter 5

**1** And thou, son of man, take unto thee a sharp sword, [even] sharper
    than a barber's razor; acquire it for thyself. And thou shalt cause it
    to pass upon thy head, and upon thy beard; and thou shalt take a balance
    [with] weights,
**2** and thou shalt divide them. The fourth part with fire thou shalt burn
    in the midst of the city, at the completion of the days of the siege.
    And thou shalt take the fourth part, and shalt utterly burn it in her midst;
    and the fourth part thou shalt smite with the sword round about her;
    and the fourth part thou shalt scatter to the wind; and a sword
    shall I draw out after them.
**3** And thou shalt take from thence a few in number, and shalt bind them up
    in the fold of thy garment.
**4** And from these thou shalt take yet [more], and shalt cast them into the
    midst of the fire, and shalt utterly burn them with fire; out of it
    shall come forth fire. And thou shalt say
**5** unto all the house of Israel:
    Thus saith Adonai the Lord:
    This is Jerusalem; in the midst of the nations have I set her,
    and the lands that are round about her.
**6** And thou shalt declare My judgments unto the lawless one out of the nations,
    and My statutes out of the lands that are round about her;
    because they rejected My judgments, and in My statutes they walked not therein.
**7** Therefore thus saith Adonai the Lord:
    Forasmuch as your provocation is from the nations that are round about you,
    and ye walked not in My statutes, and My judgments ye have not kept,
    but neither have ye done according to the judgments of the nations
    that are round about you;
**8** therefore thus saith Adonai the Lord:
    Behold, I am against thee, and I shall execute judgment in thy midst
    before the nations,
**9** and I shall do in thee what I have not done, and what I shall certainly not
    do again, [even] like unto them, because of all thine abominations.
**10** Therefore fathers shall eat their children in thy midst, and children shall
    eat their fathers; and I shall execute judgments in thee, and I shall scatter
    all thy remnant to every wind.
**11** Therefore, as I live, saith Adonai the Lord,
    surely, because thou hast defiled My holy things with all thy provocations
    and with all thine abominations, I will also cast thee away;
    and Mine eye shall not spare, and I will not have pity upon thee.
**12** Thy fourth part shall be consumed by death, and thy fourth part shall be
    brought to an end by famine in thy midst, and thy fourth part
