ΜΑΛΑΧΙΑΣ ΚΕΦ. Γ΄.
σία αὐτοῦ; διότι αὐτὸς εἰσπορεύεται ὡς πῦρ χωνευτηρίου, καὶ ὡς
3 ποιὰ πλυνόντων. Καὶ καθιεῖται χωνεύων καὶ καθαρίζων ὡς τὸ
ἀργύριον, καὶ ὡς τὸ χρυσίον, καὶ καθαρίσει τοὺς υἱοὺς Λευῒ, καὶ
χεεῖ αὐτοὺς ὡς τὸ ἀργύριον καὶ ὥσπερ τὸ χρυσίον· καὶ ἔσονται
4 τῷ Κυρίῳ προσάγοντες θυσίαν ἐν δικαιοσύνῃ, καὶ ἀρέσει τῷ Κυ-
ρίῳ θυσία Ἰούδα καὶ Ἱερουσαλὴμ, καθὼς αἱ ἡμέραι τοῦ αἰῶνος,
5 καὶ καθὼς τὰ ἔτη τὰ ἔμπροσθεν. Καὶ προσάξω πρὸς ὑμᾶς ἐν
κρίσει, καὶ ἔσομαι μάρτυς ταχὺς ἐπὶ τὰς φαρμακοὺς, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς
μοιχαλίδας, καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς ὀμνύοντας τῷ ὀνόματί μου ἐπὶ ψεύδει,
καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀποστεροῦντας μισθὸν μισθωτοῦ, καὶ τοὺς καταδυ-
ναστεύοντας χήραν, καὶ τοὺς κονδυλίζοντας ὀρφανοὺς, καὶ τοὺς
ἐκκλίνοντας κρίσιν προσηλύτου, καὶ τοὺς μὴ φοβουμένους με, λέ-
6 γει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ· διότι ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν οὐκ
7 ἠλλοίωμαι. Καὶ ὑμεῖς υἱοὶ Ἰακὼβ οὐκ ἀπέσχεσθε ἀπὸ τῶν ἀ-
δικιῶν τῶν πατέρων ὑμῶν. Ἐξεκλίνατε νόμιμά μου, καὶ οὐκ
ἐφυλάξασθε. Ἐπιστράφητε πρὸς με, καὶ ἐπιστραφήσομαι πρὸς ὑ-
μᾶς, λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ. Καὶ εἴπατε· ἐν τίνι ἐπιστρέ-
8 ψωμεν; Εἰ πτερνιεῖ ἄνθρωπος Θεόν; διότι ὑμεῖς πτερνίζετέ με.
Καὶ εἴπατε, ἐν τίνι ἐπτερνίκαμέν σε; ὅτι τὰ ἐπιδέκατα, καὶ αἱ
9 ἀπαρχαὶ μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν εἰσιν· καὶ ἀποβλέποντες ὑμεῖς ἀποβλέπετε,
καὶ ἐμὲ ὑμεῖς πτερνίζετε· τὸ ἔθνος συνετελέσθη. Καὶ εἰσηνέγκατε
10 πάντα τὰ ἐκφόρια εἰς τοὺς θησαυροὺς, καὶ ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ
ἔσται ἡ διαρπαγὴ αὐτοῦ. Ἐπιστρέψατε δὴ ἐν τούτῳ, λέγει Κύ-
ριος παντοκράτωρ· ἐὰν μὴ ἀνοίξω ὑμῖν τοὺς καταράκτας τοῦ οὐ-
ρανοῦ, καὶ ἐκχεῶ ὑμῖν τὴν εὐλογίαν μου, ἕως τοῦ ἰκχανωθῆναι· καὶ
11 διαστελῶ ὑμῖν εἰς βρῶσιν, καὶ οὐ μὴ διαφθερῶ ὑμῶν τὸν καρπὸν τῆς
12 γῆς, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἀσθενήσῃ ἡ ἄμπελος ὑμῶν ἡ ἐν ἀγρῷ, λέγει Κύριος
παντοκράτωρ· καὶ μακαριοῦσιν ὑμᾶς πάντα τὰ ἔθνη, διότι ἔσεσθε ὑ-
μεῖς γῆ θελητὴ, λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ. Ἐβαρύνατε ἐπ᾿ ἐμὲ τοὺς
13 λόγους ὑμῶν, λέγει Κύριος. Καὶ εἴπατε· ἐν τίνι κατελαλήσαμεν
14 κατὰ σοῦ; Εἴπατε· μάταιος ὁ δουλεύων Θεῷ, καὶ τί πλέον, ὅτι ἐ-
φυλάξαμεν τὰ φυλάγματα αὐτοῦ, καὶ διότι ἐπορεύθημεν ἱκέται πρὸ
15 προσώπου Κυρίου παντοκράτορος; καὶ νῦν ἡμεῖς μακαρίζομεν ἀλλο-
τρίους, καὶ ἀνοικοδομοῦνται ποιοῦντες ἄνομα, καὶ ἀντέστησαν Θεῷ,
16 καὶ ἐσώθησαν. Τότε ἐλάλησαν οἱ φοβούμενοι τὸν Κύριον, ἕκαστος
πρὸς τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ· καὶ προσέσχε Κύριος, καὶ εἰσήκουσε, καὶ ἔγραφε

**Malachi [Chapter] 3**

**2** His appearing? For He shall come in as a refiner's fire, and as the [cleansing] substances of fullers.
**3** And He shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and as of gold; and He shall purify the sons of Levi, and shall melt them as silver and as gold; and they shall be unto the LORD those who offer a sacrifice in righteousness,
**4** And the sacrifice of Judah and Jerusalem shall be pleasing unto the LORD, as in the days of old, and as in the years that are gone before.
**5** And I will draw near to you in judgment, and I shall be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulteresses, and against those who swear falsely by My Name, and against those who defraud the hireling of his wages, and those who oppress the widow, and those who strike the orphans, and those who pervert the judgment of the sojourner, and those who fear Me not, saith the LORD Almighty.
**6** For I, the LORD your God, have not changed.
**7** And ye, O sons of Jacob, have not refrained from the iniquities of your fathers. Ye have turned aside from My ordinances, and have not kept them. Return ye unto Me, and I will return unto you, saith the LORD Almighty. But ye say, "Wherein shall we return?"
**8** Shall a man defraud God? For ye have defrauded Me. Yet ye say, "Wherein have we defrauded Thee?" In that the tithes and the firstfruits are with you; and ye are surely looking away,
**9** And ye defraud Me; the nation is utterly ruined. And ye have brought all the produce into the storehouses,
**10** And in his own house shall be his plunder. Try Me now in this, saith the LORD Almighty, if I will not open for you the floodgates of heaven, and pour out for you My blessing, until ye have more than enough;
**11** And I will set apart for you for food, and I will not destroy for you the fruit of the earth,
**12** And your vine in the field shall not languish, saith the LORD Almighty. And all the nations shall call you blessed; for ye shall be a delightful land, saith the LORD Almighty. Ye have spoken harsh words against Me, saith the LORD.
**13** Yet ye say, "Wherein have we spoken against Thee?"
**14** Ye have said, "Vain it is to serve God; and what profit is it that we have kept His ordinances, and that we have walked as suppliants before the face of the LORD Almighty?"
**15** And now we call the arrogant blessed; and they who work lawlessness are built up, yea, they have stood against God, and yet are delivered.
**16** Then they that feared the LORD spake one to another, every man to his neighbor; and the LORD gave heed, and heard, and He wrote
