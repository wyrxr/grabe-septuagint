¹ Ἐν τῷ ὀγδόῳ μηνί, ἔτους δευτέρῳ, ἐπὶ Δαρείου, ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς Ζαχαρίαν τοῦ Βαραχίου, υἱὸν Ἀδδὼ, τὸν προφήτην, λέγων·
² Ὠργίσθη Κύριος ἐπὶ τοὺς πατέρας ὑμῶν ὀργὴν μεγάλην.
³ Καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτούς· τάδε λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ· ἐπιστρέψατε πρὸς μέ, λέγει Κύριος τῶν δυνάμεων, καὶ ἐπιστραφήσομαι πρὸς ὑμᾶς, λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ.
⁴ Καὶ μὴ γίνεσθε καθὼς οἱ πατέρες ὑμῶν, οἷς ἐνεκάλεσαν αὐτοῖς οἱ προφῆται οἱ ἔμπροσθεν, λέγοντες· τάδε λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ· ἀποστρέψατε ἀπὸ τῶν ὁδῶν ὑμῶν τῶν πονηρῶν, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ἐπιτηδευμάτων ὑμῶν τῶν πονηρῶν, καὶ οὐκ εἰσήκουσαν, καὶ οὐ προσέσχον τοῦ εἰσακοῦσαί μου, λέγει Κύριος.
⁵ Οἱ πατέρες ὑμῶν ποῦ εἰσι καὶ οἱ προφῆται; μὴ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα ζήσονται;
⁶ πλὴν τοὺς λόγους μου καὶ τὰ νόμιμά μου δέχεσθε, ὅσα ἐγὼ ἐντέλλομαι ἐν πνεύματί μου τοῖς δούλοις μου τοῖς προφήταις, οἳ κατελάβοσαν τοὺς πατέρας ὑμῶν. Καὶ ἀπεκρίθησαν, καὶ εἶπαν· καθὼς παρατέτακται Κύριος παντοκράτωρ τοῦ ποιῆσαι ἡμῖν κατὰ τὰς ὁδοὺς ἡμῶν, καὶ κατὰ τὰ ἐπιτηδεύματα ἡμῶν, οὕτως ἐποίησεν ἡμῖν.
⁷ Τῇ τετράδι καὶ εἰκάδι, τῷ ἑνδεκάτῳ μηνὶ, οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ μὴν Σαβάτ, ἐν τῷ δευτέρῳ ἔτει ἐπὶ Δαρείου, ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς Ζαχαρίαν τὸν τοῦ Βαραχίου, υἱὸν Ἀδδὼ, τὸν προφήτην, λέγων·
⁸ ἑώρακα τὴν νύκτα, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἀνὴρ ἐπιβεβηκὼς ἐφ᾿ ἵππον πυῤῥὸν, καὶ οὗτος εἱστήκει ἀναμέσον τῶν (δύο) ὀρέων τῶν κατασκίων, καὶ ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ ἵπποι πυῤῥοί, καὶ ψαροί, καὶ ποικίλοι, καὶ λευκοί.
⁹ Καὶ εἶπα· τί οὗτοι Κύριε; καὶ εἶπε πρὸς με ὁ ἄγγελος ὁ λαλῶν ἐν ἐμοί· ἐγὼ δείξω σοι τί ἐστι ταῦτα.
¹⁰ Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη ὁ ἀνὴρ ὁ ἐφεστηκὼς ἀναμέσον τῶν ὀρέων, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς μέ· οὗτοι εἰσὶν, οὓς ἐξαπέσταλκε Κύριος, τοῦ περιοδεῦσαι τὴν γῆν.
¹¹ Καὶ ἀπεκρίθησαν τῷ ἀγγέλῳ Κυρίου τῷ ἐφεστῶτι ἀναμέσον τῶν ὀρέων, καὶ εἶπαν· περιωδεύκαμεν πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν, καὶ ἰδοὺ πᾶσα ἡ γῆ κατοι[...].

**Zechariah [Chapter] 11.**

**Chapter I.**

**1** In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the Lord unto Zechariah, the son of Barachiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying:

**2** "The Lord was wroth with your fathers with a great wrath.

**3** And thou shalt say unto them, 'Thus saith the Lord Almighty: Turn ye unto Me,' saith the Lord of hosts, 'and I will turn unto you,' saith the Lord Almighty.

**4** And be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets cried, saying, 'Thus saith the Lord Almighty: Turn ye away from your evil ways, and from your evil practices;' yet they did not hearken, nor paid heed to hearken unto Me," saith the Lord.

**5** "Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, shall they live forever?

**6** But receive ye My words and My statutes, whatsoever I commanded by My Spirit unto My servants the prophets, which overtook your fathers. And they answered and said, 'Even as the Lord Almighty purposed to do unto us according to our ways and according to our practices, so hath He done unto us.'

**7** Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, (which is the month Sebat,) in the second year of Darius, came the word of the Lord unto Zechariah, the son of Barachiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying:

**8** "I saw in the night, and behold, a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the (two) shady mountains; and behind him were horses, red, and grizzled, and dappled, and white.

**9** And I said, 'What are these, my Lord?' And the angel that talked with me said unto me, 'I will show thee what these be.'

**10** And the man that stood among the mountains answered and said unto me, 'These are they whom the Lord hath sent forth to walk to and fro through the earth.'

**11** So they answered the angel of the Lord that stood among the mountains and said, 'We have walked to and fro through all the earth, and behold, all the earth is inhabi[...].'"
