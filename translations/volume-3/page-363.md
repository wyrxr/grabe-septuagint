    ΚΕΦ. ΜΕ΄.                                 ΙΕΡΕΜΙΑΣ                                    1301
    ἐὰν ἐξελθὼν ἐξέλθῃς πρὸς ἡγεμόνας βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος, καὶ
    ζήσεται ἡ ψυχή σου, καὶ ἡ πόλις αὕτη οὐ μὴ κατακαυθῇ ἐν
    πυρί, καὶ ζήσῃ σὺ καὶ ἡ οἰκία σου. Καὶ ἐὰν μὴ ἐξέλθῃς πρὸς 18
    τοὺς ἄρχοντας βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος, παραδοθήσεται ἡ πόλις
    αὕτη εἰς χεῖρας τῶν Χαλδαίων, καὶ καύσουσιν αὐτὴν ἐν πυρί,
    καὶ σὺ οὐ μὴ σωθῇς ἐκ χειρὸς αὐτῶν. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς 19
    τῷ Ἱερεμίᾳ· ἐγὼ λόγον ἔχω τῶν Ἰουδαίων τῶν πεφευγότων πρὸς
    τοὺς Χαλδαίους, μὴ δώσειν με εἰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν, καὶ καταμω-
    κήσωνταί μου. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἱερεμία· οὐ μὴ παραδώσουσί σε· 20
    ἄκουσον τὸν λόγον Κυρίου, ὃν ἐγὼ λέγω πρὸς σέ, καὶ βέλτιον
    ἔσται σοι, καὶ ζήσεται ἡ ψυχή σου. Καὶ εἰ μὴ βούλῃ σὺ ἐξελ- 21
    θεῖν, οὗτος δέ ὁ λόγος ὃν ἔδειξέ μοι Κύριος. Καὶ ἰδοὺ πᾶσαι αἱ 22
    γυναῖκες αἱ καταλειφθεῖσαι ἐν οἰκίᾳ βασιλέως Ἰούδα, ἐξήγοντο
    πρὸς ἄρχοντας βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος· καὶ αὗται ἔλεγον, ἠπάτη-
    σάν σε, καὶ δυνήσονταί σοι ἄνδρες εἰρηνικοί σου, καὶ καταλύ-
    σουσιν ἐν ὀλισθήμασι πόδα σου, καὶ ἀπέστρεψαν ἀπὸ σοῦ, καὶ 23
    τὰ τέκνα σου καὶ πάσας τὰς γυναικάς σου ἐξάξουσι πρὸς
    τοὺς Χαλδαίους· καὶ σὺ οὐ μὴ σωθῇς ἐκ χειρὸς αὐτῶν, ὅτι ἐν
    χειρὶ βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος συλληφθήσῃ, καὶ ἡ πόλις αὕτη κα-
    τακαυθήσεται ἐν πυρί. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ βασιλεύς· ἄνθρωπος 24
    μὴ γνώτω ἐκ τῶν λόγων τούτων, καὶ σὺ οὐ μὴ ἀποθάνῃς.
    Καὶ ἐὰν ἀκούσωσιν οἱ ἄρχοντες, ὅτι ἐλάλησά σοι, καὶ ἔλθωσι 25
    πρὸς σέ, καὶ εἴπωσι σοι, ἀνάγγειλον ἡμῖν, τί ἐλάλησέ σοι ὁ βα-
    σιλεύς; μὴ δὴ κρύψῃς ἀφ᾿ ἡμῶν, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἀνέλωμέν σε· καὶ
    τί ἐλάλησε πρὸς σὲ ὁ βασιλεύς; Καὶ ἐρεῖς αὐτοῖς, ῥίπτω ἐγὼ τὸ 26
    ἔλεός μου κατ᾿ ὀφθαλμοὺς τοῦ βασιλέως πρὸς τὸ μὴ ἐπιστρέψαι
    με εἰς οἰκίαν Ἰωνάθαν, ἀποθανεῖν ἐκεῖ. Καὶ ἦλθαν πάντες οἱ 27
    ἄρχοντες πρὸς Ἱερεμίαν, καὶ ἠρώτησαν αὐτόν· καὶ ἀνήγγειλεν
    αὐτοῖς κατὰ πάντας τοὺς λόγους τούτους, οὓς ἐνετείλατο αὐτῷ
    ὁ βασιλεύς· καὶ ἐσιώπησαν, ὅτι οὐκ ἠκούσθη ὁ λόγος Κυρίου.
    Καὶ ἐκάθισεν Ἱερεμίας ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ τῆς φυλακῆς, ἕως χρόνου, 28
    οὗ συνελήφθη Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἡ πόλις.

**JEREMIAH 45 (Septuagint) / JEREMIAH 38 (Hebrew)**

...Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel:
"If thou shalt surely go forth unto the princes of the king of Babylon, then shall thy soul live, and this city shall not be burned with fire, and thou shalt live, and thy house [also]. **18** But if thou wilt not go forth unto the rulers of the king of Babylon, then this city shall be delivered into the hands of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire; and thou shalt surely not be saved from their hand."

**19** Then said the king unto Jeremiah, "I have a word [of concern] concerning the Judeans who have fled unto the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hands, and they make sport of me." **20** Then Jeremiah said, "They shall surely not deliver thee [up]. Hearken unto the word of the Lord, which I speak unto thee, and it shall be well with thee, and thy soul shall live. **21** But if thou wilt not go forth, this is the word which the Lord hath shown me: **22** And behold, all the women that were left in the house of the king of Judah were being led forth unto the princes of the king of Babylon; and these women did say, 'They have deceived thee; and thy men of peace shall prevail against thee, and they shall cause thy foot to stumble with falterings, and they have turned away from thee, **23** and thy children and all thy wives shall they bring forth unto the Chaldeans; and thou shalt surely not be saved from their hand, for thou shalt be seized by the hand of the king of Babylon, and this city shall be burned with fire.'"

**24** Then said the king unto him, "Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt surely not die. **25** And if the princes hear that I have spoken with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee, 'Declare unto us, what did the king speak unto thee? Hide it not from us, and we will not kill thee.' And what did the king speak unto thee?" **26** And thou shalt say unto them, "I cast my supplication before the eyes of the king, that he send me not back to the house of Jonathan, to die there."

**27** Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and they asked him; and he declared unto them according to all these words, which the king had commanded him. And they held their peace, for the word of the Lord was not heard. **28** And Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison until the time that Jerusalem, the city, was taken.
