δὲ τρίτῳ ἔτει σπείραντες ἀμήσατε, καὶ φυτεύσατε ἀμπελῶνας,
καὶ φάγεσθε τὸν καρπὸν αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἔσονται οἱ καταλελειμ- 31
μένοι ἐν τῇ Ἰουδαίᾳ, φύσουσι ῥίζαν κάτω, καὶ ποιήσουσι σπέρ-
μα ἄνω, ὅτι ἐξ Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐξελεύσονται οἱ καταλελειμμένοι, 32
καὶ οἱ σωζόμενοι ἐξ ὄρους Σιὼν ὁ ζῆλος Κυρίου Σαβαὼθ
ποιήσει ταῦτα. Διὰ τοῦτο οὕτως λέγει Κύριος ἐπὶ βασιλέα 33
Ἀσσυρίων· οὐ μὴ εἰσέλθῃ εἰς τὴν πόλιν ταύτην· οὐδὲ μὴ βάλῃ
ἐπ’ αὐτὴν βέλος, οὐδὲ μὴ ἐπιβάλῃ ἐπ’ αὐτὴν θυρεόν, οὐδὲ μὴ
κυκλώσῃ ἐπ’ αὐτὴν χάρακα, ἀλλὰ τῇ ὁδῷ ᾗ ἦλθεν, ἐν αὐτῇ 34
ἀποστραφήσεται, καὶ εἰς τὴν πόλιν ταύτην οὐ μὴ εἰσέλθῃ·
τάδε λέγει Κύριος· ὑπερασπιῶ ὑπὲρ τῆς πόλεως ταύτης τοῦ 35
σῶσαι αὐτὴν δι’ ἐμέ, καὶ διὰ Δαυὶδ τὸν παῖδά μου. Καὶ ἐξῆλ- 36
θεν ἄγγελος Κυρίου, καὶ ἀνεῖλεν ἐκ τῆς παρεμβολῆς τῶν Ἀσ-
συρίων ἑκατὸν καὶ ὀγδοηκονταπέντε χιλιάδας· καὶ ἐξαναστάντες
τὸ πρωΐ, εὗρον πάντα τὰ σώματα νεκρά. Καὶ ἀποστραφεὶς 37
ἀπῆλθε Σενναχηρεὶμ βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων, καὶ ᾤκησεν ἐν Νινευῆ,
καὶ ἐν τῷ αὐτὸν προσκυνεῖν ἐν οἴκῳ Νασαρὰχ τὸν πάτραρχον 38
αὐτοῦ, Ἀδραμέλεχ καὶ Σαρασὰρ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ ἐπάταξαν αὐτὸν
μαχαίραις, αὐτοὶ δὲ διεσώθησαν εἰς Ἀρμενίαν, καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν
Ἀσορδὰν ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀντ’ αὐτοῦ.

ἘΓΕΝΕΤΟ δὲ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ, ἐμαλακίσθη Ἑζεκίας 1
ἕως θανάτου· καὶ ἦλθε πρὸς αὐτὸν Ἠσαΐας υἱὸς Ἀμὼς ὁ
προφήτης, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτόν· τάδε λέγει Κύριος· τάξαι
περὶ τοῦ οἴκου σου, ὅτι ἀποθνήσκεις σύ, καὶ οὐ ζήσῃ. Καὶ 2
ἐπέστρεψεν Ἑζεκίας τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ πρὸς τὸν τοῖχον, καὶ
προσηύξατο πρὸς Κύριον, λέγων· Ὠδή· μνήσθητι δή, Κύριε, 3
ὡς ἐπορεύθην ἐνώπιόν σου μετὰ ἀληθείας, ἐν καρδίᾳ ἀληθινῇ,
καὶ τὰ ἀρεστὰ ἐνώπιόν σου ἐποίησα, καὶ ἔκλαυσεν Ἑζεκίας
κλαυθμῷ μεγάλῳ. Καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς Ἠσαΐαν, 4
λέγων. Πορεύου, καὶ εἰπὸν πρὸς Ἑζεκίαν· τάδε λέγει Κύριος 5
ὁ Θεὸς Δαυὶδ τοῦ πατρός σου· ἤκουσα τῆς φωνῆς τῆς προσευ-
χῆς σου, καὶ ἴδον τὰ δάκρυά σου, ἰδοὺ προστίθημι πρὸς τὸν
χρόνον σου ἔτη δεκαπέντε, καὶ ἐκ χειρὸς βασιλέως Ἀσσυρίων 6

### Isaiah
#### Chapter 37

**30** the third year ye shall sow, and reap the harvest; and ye shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.
**31** And those who are left in Judah shall put forth roots downward, and shall bear fruit upward.
**32** For out of Jerusalem shall go forth those who are left, and those who are saved out of Mount Zion; the zeal of the Lord Sabaoth shall perform these things.
**33** Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the king of Assyria: He shall not enter into this city, nor shall he cast a dart against it, nor shall he set forth a shield against it, nor shall he cast up a rampart against it.
**34** But by the way by which he came, by the same shall he return, and into this city shall he not enter.
**35** Thus saith the Lord: I will defend this city to save it for My sake, and for David My servant's sake."
**36** And the angel of the Lord went forth, and slew from the camp of the Assyrians one hundred and eighty-five thousand; and when they arose in the morning, they found all the bodies dead.
**37** And Sennacherib, king of Assyria, turned back and departed, and he dwelt in Nineveh.
**38** And as he was worshipping in the house of Nasarach his patriarch, Adramelech and Sarasar his sons struck him with swords; and they themselves escaped into Armenia, and Asordan his son reigned in his stead.

#### Chapter 38

**1** Now it came to pass in that time, that Hezekiah was sick unto death; and Isaiah the son of Amoz, the prophet, came unto him, and said to him, "Thus saith the Lord: Set thine house in order, for thou shalt die, and not live."
**2** And Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto the Lord, saying,
**3** "Ode: Remember now, O Lord, how I have walked before Thee with truth, in a true heart, and have done that which is pleasing in Thy sight." And Hezekiah wept with a great weeping.
**4** And the word of the Lord came to Isaiah, saying,
**5** "Go, and say unto Hezekiah, 'Thus saith the Lord, the God of David thy father: I have heard the voice of thy prayer, and I have seen thy tears; behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years,
**6** and I will deliver thee and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria, and for this city will I defend it."
