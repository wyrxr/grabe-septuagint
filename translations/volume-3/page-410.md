8 χεται ἐν αὐτῷ. Καὶ στηριῶ τὸ πρόσωπόν μου ἐπὶ τὸν ἄνθρωπον
ἐκεῖνον, καὶ θήσω αὐτὸν εἰς ἔρημον καὶ εἰς ἀφανισμὸν, καὶ ἐξαρῶ
αὐτὸν ἐκ μέσου τοῦ λαοῦ μου, καὶ ἐπιγνώσεσθε, ὅτι ἐγὼ Κύριος.
9 Καὶ ὁ προφήτης ἐὰν πλανηθῇ καὶ λαλήσῃ λόγον, ἐγὼ Κύριος ἐπλά-
νησα τὸν προφήτην ἐκεῖνον, καὶ ἐκτενῶ τὴν χεῖρά μου ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν,
10 καὶ ἀφανιῶ αὐτὸν ἐκ μέσου τοῦ λαοῦ μου Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ λήψονται
τὴν ἀδικίαν αὐτῶν· κατὰ τὸ ἀδίκημα τοῦ ἐπερωτῶντος· καὶ κατὰ
11 τὸ ἀδίκημα ὁμοίως τῷ προφήτῃ ἔσται, ὅπως μὴ πλανᾶται ἔτι ὁ
οἶκος Ἰσραὴλ ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ, καὶ ἵνα μὴ μιαίνωνται ἔτι ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς
παραπτώμασιν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔσονται μοι εἰς λαὸν, καὶ ἐγὼ ἔσομαι
12 αὐτοῖς εἰς Θεὸν, λέγει Ἀδωναΐ Κύριος· καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου
13 πρὸς με, λέγων· υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, γῆ ἐὰν ἁμάρτῃ μοι τοῦ παραπεσεῖν
παράπτωμα, καὶ ἐκτενῶ τὴν χεῖρά μου ἐπ᾿ αὐτὴν, καὶ συντρίψω ἀπ᾿
αὐτῆς στήριγμα ἄρτου, καὶ ἐξαποστελῶ ἐπ᾿ αὐτὴν λιμὸν, καὶ ἐξαρῶ
14 ἀπ᾿ αὐτῆς ἄνθρωπον καὶ κτήνη. Καὶ ἐὰν ὦσιν οἱ τρεῖς ἄνδρες οὗ-
τοι ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῆς, Νῶε καὶ Δανιὴλ καὶ Ἰὼβ, οὗτοι ἐν τῇ δικαιο-
15 σύνη αὐτῶν σωθήσονται, λέγει Ἀδωναΐ Κύριος. Ἐὰν δὲ καὶ θηρία
πονηρὰ ἐπαγάγω ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, καὶ τιμωρήσομαι αὐτὴν, καὶ ἔσται
εἰς ἀφανισμὸν, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ὁ διοδεύων ἀπὸ προσώπου τῶν θη-
16 ρίων, καὶ οἱ τρεῖς ἄνδρες οὗτοι ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῆς ὦσι· ζῶ ἐγὼ, λέ-
γει Κύριος, εἰ υἱοὶ καὶ θυγατέρες αὐτῶν σωθήσονται, ἀλλ᾿ ἢ αὐτοὶ
17 μόνοι σωθήσονται, ἡ δὲ γῆ ἔσται εἰς ὄλεθρον. Ἢ καὶ ἐὰν ῥομ-
φαίαν ἐπαγάγω ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ἐκείνην, καὶ εἴπω, ῥομφαία διελθάτω
18 διὰ τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἐξαρῶ ἐξ αὐτῆς ἄνθρωπον καὶ κτῆνος, καὶ οἱ τρεῖς
ἄνδρες οὗτοι ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῆς ὦσι, ζῶ ἐγὼ, λέγει Ἀδωναΐ Κύριος,
οὐ μὴ ῥύσωνται υἱοὺς ἢ θυγατέρας, ἀλλ᾿ ἢ αὐτοὶ μόνοι σωθήσον-
19 ται. Ἢ καὶ θάνατον ἐπάγω ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ἐκείνην, καὶ ἐκχεῶ τὸν
θυμόν μου ἐπ᾿ αὐτὴν ἐν αἵματι, τοῦ ἐξολεθρεῦσαι ἐξ αὐτῆς ἄνθρωπον
20 καὶ κτῆνος, καὶ Νῶε καὶ Δανιὴλ καὶ Ἰὼβ ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῆς ὦσι, ζῶ
ἐγὼ, λέγει Ἀδωναΐ Κύριος, ἐὰν υἱοὶ ἢ θυγατέρες ὑπολειφθῶσιν
αὐτοῖς, αὐτοὶ ἐν τῇ δικαιοσύνη αὐτῶν ῥύσονται τὰς ψυχὰς αὐτῶν.
21 Τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναΐ Κύριος· ἐὰν δὲ καὶ τὰς τέσσαρας ἐκδικήσεις
μου τὰς πονηρὰς, ῥομφαίαν, καὶ λιμὸν, καὶ θηρία πονηρὰ, καὶ θά-
νατον ἐπαποστελῶ ἐπὶ Ἱερουσαλὴμ τοῦ ἐξολεθρεῦσαι ἐξ αὐτῆς ἀν-
22 θρωπον καὶ κτῆνος. Καὶ ἰδοὺ ὑπολελειμμένοι ἐν αὐτῇ οἱ ἀνασεσω-
σμένοι ἐξ αὐτῆς, οἳ ἐξάγουσιν υἱοὺς καὶ θυγατέρας, αὐτοὶ ἐκπο-

### Chapter XIV.

**12** ...in that wherein he is entangled in it.
**13** And I will set My face against that man, and I will make him a desolation and an annihilation, and I will cut him off from the midst of My people; and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
**14** And if the prophet be deceived and speak a word, I the Lord have deceived that prophet; and I will stretch forth My hand upon him, and I will destroy him from the midst of My people Israel. And they shall bear their iniquity; according to the iniquity of him that inquireth, and according to the iniquity, it shall be likewise to the prophet. So that the house of Israel may no longer stray from Me, and that they may no longer be defiled in all their transgressions; and they shall be to Me a people, and I will be to them a God, saith Adonai the Lord.
**15** And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying:
**16** "Son of man, if a land sin against Me by falling away in transgression, and I stretch forth My hand upon it, and break from it the staff of bread, and send forth upon it famine, and cut off from it man and beast;
**17** and if these three men be in the midst thereof, Noah and Daniel and Job, these shall be saved by their righteousness, saith Adonai the Lord.
**18** But if I also bring evil beasts upon the land, and I shall punish it, and it shall be for annihilation, and there shall be none passing through because of the presence of the beasts;
**19** and if these three men be in the midst thereof: As I live, saith the Lord, surely their sons and their daughters shall not be saved; but only they themselves shall be saved, and the land shall be for destruction.
**20** Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, 'Let the sword pass through the land,' and I cut off from it man and beast;
**21** and if these three men be in the midst thereof: As I live, saith Adonai the Lord, they shall by no means deliver sons or daughters, but only they themselves shall be saved.
**22** Or if I bring pestilence upon that land, and pour out My wrath upon it in blood, to destroy from it man and beast;
**23** and if Noah and Daniel and Job be in the midst thereof: As I live, saith Adonai the Lord, if sons or daughters be left unto them, they themselves, by their righteousness, shall deliver their own souls.
**24** Thus saith Adonai the Lord: But if I also send My four evil judgments – the sword, and famine, and evil beasts, and pestilence – upon Jerusalem, to destroy from it man and beast;
**25** and behold, there are left in it those who have been rescued from it, who lead forth sons and daughters, they shall go forth...
