σὸν σύντριμμα σύντριψον αὐτούς. Τάδε λέγει Κύριος πρὸς μέ· 19
βάδισον, καὶ στῆθι ἐν πύλαις υἱῶν λαοῦ σου, ἐν αἷς εἰσπορεύονται
ἐν αὐταῖς βασιλεῖς Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐν αἷς ἐκπορεύονται ἐν αὐταῖς,
καὶ ἐν πάσαις ταῖς πύλαις Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτούς· 20
ἀκούσατε λόγον Κυρίου βασιλεῖς Ἰούδα, καὶ πᾶσα Ἰουδαία, καὶ
πάντες κατοικοῦντες Ἱερουσαλήμ, οἱ εἰσπορευόμενοι ἐν ταῖς πύ-
λαις ταύταις. Τάδε λέγει Κύριος· φυλάσσεσθε τὰς ψυχὰς ὑμῶν, 21
καὶ μὴ αἴρετε βαστάγματα ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῶν σαββάτων, καὶ μὴ
ἐκπορεύεσθε ταῖς πύλαις Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ μὴ ἐκφέρετε βαστάγ- 22
ματα ἐξ οἴκων ὑμῶν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῶν σαββάτων, καὶ πᾶν ἔρ-
γον οὐ ποιήσετε· ἁγιάσατε τὴν ἡμέραν τῶν σαββάτων, καθὼς
ἐνετειλάμην τοῖς πατράσιν ὑμῶν· καὶ οὐκ ἤκουσαν, καὶ οὐκ ἔκλι-
ναν τὸ οὖς αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐσκλήρυναν τὸν τράχηλον αὐτῶν ὑπὲρ 23
τοὺς πατέρας αὐτῶν, τοῦ μὴ εἰσακοῦσαί μου, καὶ τοῦ μὴ δέξασθαι
παιδείαν. Καὶ ἔσται, ἐὰν ἀκούσητέ μου, λέγει Κύριος, τοῦ μὴ 24
εἰσφέρειν βαστάγματα διὰ τῶν πυλῶν τῆς πόλεως ταύτης ἐν τῇ
ἡμέρᾳ τῶν σαββάτων, καὶ ἁγιάζειν τὴν ἡμέραν τῶν σαββάτων, τοῦ
μὴ ποιεῖν ἐν αὐτῇ πᾶν ἔργον, καὶ εἰσελεύσονται διὰ τῶν πυλῶν τῆς 25
πόλεως ταύτης βασιλεῖς καὶ ἄρχοντες, καθήμενοι ἐπὶ θρόνου Δαυΐδ,
καὶ ἐπιβεβηκότες ἐφ᾿ ἅρμασι καὶ ἵπποις αὐτῶν, αὐτοὶ καὶ οἱ ἄρχον-
τες αὐτῶν, ἄνδρες Ἰούδα καὶ οἱ κατοικοῦντες Ἱερουσαλήμ· καὶ
κατοικηθήσεται ἡ πόλις αὕτη εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, καὶ ἥξουσιν ἐκ 26
τῶν πόλεων Ἰούδα, καὶ κυκλόθεν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἐκ γῆς Βε-
νιαμείν, καὶ ἐκ τῆς πεδινῆς, καὶ ἐκ τοῦ ὄρους, καὶ ἐκ τῆς πρὸς
νότον, φέροντες ὁλοκαυτώματα καὶ θυσίαν καὶ θυμίαμα καὶ
Μανὰ καὶ λίβανον, φέροντες αἴνεσιν εἰς οἶκον Κυρίου. Καὶ ἔσται 27
ἐὰν μὴ εἰσακούσητέ μου τοῦ ἁγιάζειν τὴν ἡμέραν τῶν σαββά-
των, τοῦ μὴ αἴρειν βαστάγματα, καὶ εἰσπορεύεσθαι ταῖς πύλαις
Ἱερουσαλήμ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῶν σαββάτων, καὶ ἀνάψω πῦρ ἐν
ταῖς πύλαις αὐτῆς, καὶ καταφάγεται ἀμφόδια Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ
οὐ σβεσθήσεται.

### JEREMIAH 17

**18** And with thy shattering, do Thou shatter them.
**19** Thus saith the Lord unto me: Go, and stand within the gates of the sons of thy people, [even those] wherein enter therein the kings of Judah, and wherein they go out therein, and in all the gates of Jerusalem; and thou shalt say unto them:
**20** Hear ye the word of the Lord, ye kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all ye that dwell in Jerusalem, who enter in by these gates.
**21** Thus saith the Lord: Take heed to your souls, and bear no burdens on the day of the sabbaths, and go not forth
**22** by the gates of Jerusalem, and bring ye forth no burdens out of your houses on the day of the sabbaths; neither shall ye do any work, but sanctify the day of the sabbaths, as I commanded your fathers.
**23** But they hearkened not, neither inclined their ear, but hardened their neck above their fathers, so as not to hearken unto Me, and not to receive instruction.
**24** And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken unto Me, saith the Lord, so as not to bring in burdens through the gates of this city on the day of the sabbaths, and to sanctify the day of the sabbaths, so as not to do any work therein,
**25** then shall there enter in by the gates of this city kings and princes, sitting upon the throne of David, and riding upon their chariots and their horses, even they and their princes, the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and this city shall be inhabited forever.
**26** And they shall come out of the cities of Judah, and from round about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the lowland, and from the mountain, and from the south, bringing whole burnt offerings and sacrifice and incense and Manna and frankincense, bringing praise into the house of the Lord.
**27** But it shall be, if ye hearken not unto Me to sanctify the day of the sabbaths, so as not to bear burdens, and to enter in by the gates of Jerusalem on the day of the sabbaths, then will I kindle a fire in its gates, and it shall devour the precincts of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.

### JEREMIAH 18

**1** The word which came from the Lord unto Jeremiah, saying:
**2** Arise, and go down into the house of the potter, and there shalt thou hear My words.
**3** So I went down into the house of the potter,
**4** and behold, he wrought a work upon the stones; and the vessel, which he made of the clay in his hands, fell.
