γραφὴν ταύτην ἐνέταξε. Καὶ αὕτη ἡ γραφὴ ἡ ἐντεταγμένη· μανῆ, 25
θεκέλ, φάρες. Τοῦτο τὸ σύγκριμα τοῦ ῥήματος· μανῆ, 26
ἐμέτρησεν ὁ Θεὸς τὴν βασιλείαν σου, καὶ ἐπλήρωσεν αὐτήν· θεκέλ, 27
ἐστάθη ἐν ζυγῷ, καὶ εὑρέθη ὑστεροῦσα· φάρες, διήρηται ἡ βασιλεία 28
σου, καὶ ἐδόθη Μήδοις καὶ Πέρσαις. Καὶ εἶπε Βαλτάσαρ, 29
καὶ ἐνέδυσαν τὸν Δανιὴλ πορφύραν, καὶ τὸν μανιάκην τὸν
χρυσοῦν περιέθηκαν περὶ τὸν τράχηλον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐκήρυξε περὶ
αὐτοῦ, τοῦ εἶναι αὐτὸν ἄρχοντα τρίτον ἐν τῇ βασιλεία αὐτοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. ς΄. VI.

ΚΑΙ ἤρεσεν ἐνώπιον Δαρείου, καὶ κατέστησεν ἐπὶ τῆς βασιλείας 1
σατράπας ἑκατὸν εἴκοσι, τοῦ εἶναι αὐτοὺς ἐν πάσῃ τῇ
βασιλείᾳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπάνω αὐτῶν τακτικοὺς τρεῖς, ὧν ἦν Δανιὴλ 2
εἷς ἐξ αὐτῶν, τοῦ ἀποδιδόναι αὐτοῖς τοὺς σατράπας λόγον, ὅπως
ὁ βασιλεὺς μὴ ἐνοχλῆται. Καὶ ἦν Δανιὴλ ὑπὲρ αὐτοὺς, ὅτι πνεῦμα 3
περισσὸν ἦν ἐν αὐτῷ, καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς κατέστησεν αὐτὸν ἐφ᾽
ὅλης τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ. Καὶ οἱ τακτικοὶ καὶ οἱ σατράπαι ἐζήτουν 4
πρόφασιν εὑρεῖν κατὰ Δανιήλ· καὶ πᾶσαν πρόφασιν καὶ πα-
ράπτωμα καὶ ἀμπλάκημα οὐχ εὗρον κατ᾽ αὐτοῦ, ὅτι πιστὸς ἦν. Καὶ 5
εἶπον οἱ τακτικοί· οὐχ εὑρήσομεν κατὰ Δανιὴλ πρόφασιν, εἰ μὴ
ἐν νομίμοις Θεοῦ αὐτοῦ. Τότε οἱ τακτικοὶ καὶ οἱ σατράπαι πα- 6
ρέστησαν τῷ βασιλεῖ, καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῷ· Δαρεῖε βασιλεῦ, εἰς τοὺς
αἰῶνας ζῆθι. Συνεβουλεύσαντο πάντες οἱ ἐπὶ τῆς βασιλείας σου 7
στρατηγοὶ καὶ σατράπαι, ὕπατοι καὶ τοπάρχαι, τοῦ στῆσαι στά-
σιν βασιλικήν, καὶ ἐνισχῦσαι ὅρισμον, ὅπως ὃς ἂν αἰτήσηται αἴ-
τημα παρὰ παντὸς Θεοῦ καὶ ἀνθρώπου, ἕως ἡμερῶν τριάκοντα,
ἀλλ᾽ ἢ παρὰ σοῦ βασιλεῦ, ἐμβληθήσηται εἰς τὸν λάκκον τῶν λεόν-
των. Νῦν οὖν, βασιλεῦ, στῆσον ὅρισμον, καὶ ἔκθες γραφήν, ὅπως 8
μὴ ἀλλοιωθῇ τὸ δόγμα Μήδων καὶ Περσῶν. Τότε ὁ βασιλεὺς 9
Δαρεῖος ἐπέταξε γραφῆναι τὸ δόγμα. Καὶ Δανιὴλ ἡνίκα ἔγνω, 10
ὅτι ἐνετάγη τὸ δόγμα, εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸν οἶκον ἑαυτοῦ· καὶ αἱ θυ-
ρίδες ἠνεωγμέναι αὐτῷ ἐν τοῖς ὑπερώοις αὐτοῦ κατέναντι Ἱερου-

inscribed this writing.
**25** And this is the writing that was inscribed: MENE,
**26** TEKEL, PERES. This is the interpretation of the matter: MENE,
**27** God hath numbered thy kingdom, and brought it to an end; TEKEL,
**28** thou art weighed in the balance, and found wanting; PERES, thy kingdom is divided,
**29** and is given to the Medes and Persians." Then Belshazzar commanded, and they clothed Daniel with purple, and [placed] the golden chain about his neck; and proclamation was made concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in his kingdom.
**30** (Vision VI, Vision VII) In that very night was Belshazzar slain,
**31** the king of the Chaldeans. And Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being sixty and two years old.

### Chapter VI

**1** And it pleased Darius to set over the kingdom one hundred and twenty satraps, that they might be over the whole kingdom;
**2** and over these three presidents, of whom Daniel was one, that the satraps might give accounts unto them, and that the king should suffer no loss.
**3** But Daniel was preferred above these presidents and satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.
**4** Then the presidents and satraps sought to find occasion against Daniel; and they found no occasion nor fault nor error against him, forasmuch as he was faithful.
**5** And the presidents said, "We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it concerning the law of his God."
**6** Then these presidents and satraps assembled together before the king, and said thus unto him, "King Darius, live for ever.
**7** All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the satraps, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, save of thee, O King, he shall be cast into the den of lions.
**8** Now, O King, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not."
**9** Wherefore King Darius signed the writing and the decree.
**10** Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem,
