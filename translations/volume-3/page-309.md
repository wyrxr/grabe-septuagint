**ΚΕΦ. Κ´. ΙΕΡΕΜΙΑΣ 1247**

**3** Κυρίου. Καὶ ἐγένετο τῇ ἐπαύριον, καὶ ἐξήγαγε Πασχὼρ τὸν Ἱερεμίαν ἐκ τοῦ καταράκτου· καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Ἰερεμίας· οὐχὶ Πασχὼρ ἐκάλεσε τὸ ὄνομά σου, ἀλλ’ ἡ μέτοικον κυκλόθεν.
**4** Διότι τάδε λέγει Κύριος· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ δίδωμί σε εἰς μετοικίαν σὺν πᾶσι τοῖς φίλοις σου· καὶ πεσοῦνται ἐν μαχαίρᾳ ἐχθρῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ οἱ ὀφθαλμοί σου ὄψονται, καὶ σὲ καὶ πάντα Ἰούδαν δώσω εἰς χείρας βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος, καὶ μετοικιοῦσιν αὐτοὺς εἰς Βαβυλῶνα, καὶ κατακόψουσιν αὐτοὺς ἐν μαχαίρᾳ.
**5** Καὶ δώσω πᾶσαν τὴν ἰσχὺν τῆς πόλεως ταύτης, καὶ πάντας τοὺς πόνους αὐτῆς, καὶ σύμπασαν τὴν τιμὴν αὐτῆς, καὶ πάντας τοὺς θησαυροὺς τοῦ βασιλέως Ἰούδα δώσω εἰς χεῖρας ἐχθρῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ διαρπῶνται αὐτούς, καὶ λήψονται αὐτούς, καὶ ἄξουσιν αὐτοὺς εἰς Βαβυλῶνα.
**6** Καὶ σὺ Πασχώρ, καὶ πάντες οἱ κατοικοῦντες ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ σου, πορεύσεσθε ἐν αἰχμαλωσίᾳ, καὶ εἰς Βαβυλῶνα ἥξεις καὶ ἐκεῖ ἀποθανῇ, καὶ ἐκεῖ ταφήσῃ σὺ καὶ πάντες οἱ φίλοι σου οἷς ἐπροφήτευσας αὐτοῖς ψευδῆ.
**7** Ἡπάτησάς με, Κύριε, καὶ ἠπατήθην, ἐκράτησας, καὶ ἠδυνάσθης· ἐγενόμην εἰς γέλωτα, πᾶσαν ἡμέραν διετελέσα μυκτηριζόμενος.
**8** Ὅτι πικρῷ λόγῳ μου γελάσομαι, ἀθεσίαν καὶ ταλαιπωρίαν ἐπικαλέσομαι, ὅτι ἐγενήθη λόγος Κυρίου εἰς ὀνειδισμὸν ἐμοὶ καὶ εἰς χλευασμὸν πᾶσαν ἡμέραν μου.
**9** Καὶ εἶπα· οὐ μὴ ὀνομάσω τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου, καὶ οὐ μὴ λαλήσω ἔτι ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ μου ὡς πῦρ καιόμενον, φλέγον ἐν τοῖς ὀστέοις μου, καὶ παρεῖμαι πάντοθεν, καὶ οὐ δύναμαι φέρειν,
**10** ἔτι ἤκουσα ψόγον πολλῶν συναθροιζομένων κυκλόθεν· ἐπίσυστητε, καὶ ἐπισυστώμεν ἐπ’ αὐτῷ πάντες ἄνδρες φίλοι αὐτοῦ· τηρήσατε τὴν ἐπίνοιαν αὐτοῦ, εἰ ἀπατηθήσεται, καὶ δυνησόμεθα αὐτῷ, καὶ ληψόμεθα τὴν ἐκδίκησιν ἡμῶν ἐξ αὐτοῦ.
**11** Καὶ Κύριος μετ’ ἐμοῦ καθὼς μαχητὴς ἰσχυρός· διὰ τοῦτο ἐδίωξαν, καὶ νοῆσαι οὐκ ἠδύναντο· ἠσχύνθησαν σφόδρα, ὅτι οὐκ ἐνόησαν ἀτιμίας αὐτῶν, αἳ δι’ αἰῶνος οὐκ ἐπιλησθήσονται.
**12** Κύριε, δοκιμάζων δίκαια, συνιὼν νεφροὺς καὶ καρδίας, ἴδοιμι τὴν παρὰ σοῦ ἐκδίκησιν ἐν αὐτοῖς, ὅτι πρὸς σὲ ἀπεκάλυψα τὰ ἀπολογήματά μου.
**13** Ἂσατε τῷ Κυρίῳ, αἰνέσατε αὐτῷ, ὅτι ἐξείλατο τὴν ψυχὴν πένητος ἐκ χειρὸς πονηρευομένων.
**14** Ἐπικατάρατος ἡ ἡμέρα, ᾗ ἐν ἐτέχθην ἐν αὐτῇ· ἡ ἡμέρα, ἐν ᾗ ἔτεκέ με ἡ μήτηρ μου, μὴ ἔστω ἐπευκτή.
**15** Ἐπικατάρατος ὁ ἀνθρωπος ὁ εὐαγγελισάμενος τῷ πατρί μου, λέγων,

### JEREMIAH 20

**3** ...the Lord. And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashhur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks; and Jeremiah said unto him, 'Not Pashhur hath He called thy name, but [one that is] an Exile Round About.'
**4** For thus saith the Lord: 'Behold, I will give thee into exile with all thy friends; and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall behold [it]. And thee and all Judah will I give into the hands of the king of Babylon; and they shall carry them away captive unto Babylon, and shall slay them by the sword.
**5** And I will give all the might of this city, and all her labours, yea, all her honour, and all the treasures of the king of Judah, will I give into the hands of their enemies; and they shall plunder them [for themselves], and shall take them, and shall bring them unto Babylon.
**6** And thou, Pashhur, and all that dwell in thy house, shall go into captivity; and unto Babylon shalt thou come, and there shalt thou die, and there shalt thou be buried, thou and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied false [words].'
**7** Thou hast deceived me, O Lord, and I was deceived; Thou art mighty, and Thou hast prevailed. I am become a derision, and all the day long have I been mocked.
**8** For by my bitter word shall I laugh, [as] I cry out unfaithfulness and tribulation; because the word of the Lord is made unto me a reproach and a derision all the day long.
**9** Then I said, 'I will not make mention of the name of the Lord, nor speak any more in His name.' But it was in my heart as a burning fire, flaming in my bones; and I am utterly worn out, and I cannot bear [it].
**10** For I heard the reviling of many, gathered round about: 'Gather ye together, and let all men, his friends, conspire against him! Watch ye his intention, if he be deceived, then shall we prevail against him, and we shall take our vengeance of him.'
**11** But the Lord is with me as a mighty warrior; therefore they persecuted, yet they could not understand. They were greatly ashamed, for they perceived not their dishonors, which shall never be forgotten.
**12** O Lord, that dost try the righteous, who perceivest the reins and the hearts, may I see Thy vengeance upon them; for unto Thee have I revealed my pleas.
**13** Sing unto the Lord, praise ye Him, for He hath delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers.
**14** Cursed be the day wherein I was born; let not the day wherein my mother bore me be blessed.
**15** Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying,
