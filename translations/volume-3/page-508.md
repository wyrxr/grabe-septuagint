οἰκοδομῆσαι Ἱερουσαλὴμ, ἕως χριστοῦ ἡγουμένου ἑβδομάδες ἑπτὰ,
καὶ ἑβδομάδες ἑξηκονταδύο· καὶ ἐπιστρέψει, καὶ οἰκοδομηθήσεται
26 πλατεῖα, καὶ περίτειχος, καὶ ἐκκενωθήσονται οἱ καιροὶ, καὶ με-
τὰ τὰς ἑβδομάδας τὰς ἑξηκονταδύο, ἐξολεθρευθήσεται χρίσμα,
καὶ κρῖμα οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν αὐτῷ· καὶ τὴν πόλιν, καὶ τὸ ἅγιον δια-
φθερεῖ σὺν τῷ ἡγουμένῳ τῷ ἐρχομένῳ, καὶ ἐκκοπήσονται ἐν κα-
τακλυσμῷ, καὶ ἕως τέλους πολέμου συντετμημένου τάξει ἀφα-
27 νισμοῖς. Καὶ δυναμώσει διαθήκην πολλοῖς ἑβδομὰς μία· καὶ ἐν
τῷ ἡμίσει τῆς ἑβδομάδος καταπαύσει θυσιαστήριον καὶ θυσίαν,
καὶ ἕως πτερυγίου ἀπὸ ἀφανισμοῦ καὶ ἕως συντελείας καὶ σπου-
δῆς τάξει ἐπὶ ἀφανισμοῦ, καὶ δυναμώσει διαθήκην πολλοῖς ἑβδο-
μὰς μία, καὶ ἐν τῷ ἡμίσει τῆς ἑβδομάδος ἀρθήσεταί μου θυσία
καὶ σπονδὴ, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸ ἱερὸν βδέλυγμα τῶν ἐρημώσεων ἔσται,
καὶ ἕως τῆς συντελείας καιροῦ συντέλεια δοθήσεται ἐπὶ τὴν ἐρή-
μωσιν.

1 Ἐν ἔτει τρίτῳ Κύρου βασιλέως Περσῶν λόγος ἀπεκαλύφθη
τῷ Δανιὴλ, οὗ τὸ ὄνομα ἐπεκλήθη Βαλτάσαρ· καὶ ἀληθινὸς ὁ
λόγος, καὶ δύναμις μεγάλη καὶ σύνεσις ἐδόθη αὐτῷ ἐν τῇ ὀπτα-
2 σίᾳ. Ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις, ἐγὼ Δανιὴλ ἤμην πενθῶν τρεῖς
3 ἑβδομάδας ἡμερῶν, ἄρτον ἐπιθυμιῶν οὐκ ἔφαγον, καὶ κρέας καὶ
οἶνος οὐκ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸ στόμα μου, καὶ ἄλειμμα οὐκ ἠλειψάμην,
4 ἕως πληρώσεως τριῶν ἑβδομάδων ἡμερῶν. Ἐν ἡμέρᾳ εἰκοστῇ καὶ
τετάρτῃ τοῦ μηνὸς τοῦ πρώτου, καὶ ἐγὼ ἤμην ἐχόμενα τοῦ πο-
5 ταμοῦ τοῦ μεγάλου, αὐτός ἐστι τίγρις Ἑιδδεκελ. Καὶ ἦρα τοὺς
ὀφθαλμούς μου καὶ ἴδον, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἀνὴρ εἷς ἐνδεδυμένος βαδδὶν,
6 καὶ ἡ ὀσφῦς αὐτοῦ περιεζωσμένη ἐν χρυσίῳ Ὠφὰζ, καὶ τὸ σῶμα
αὐτοῦ ὡσεὶ θάρσεις, καὶ τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ὡς ὅρασις ἀστρα-
πῆς, καὶ οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτοῦ ὡς λαμπάδες πυρὸς, καὶ οἱ βραχί-
ονες αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰ σκέλη ὡς ὅρασις χαλκοῦ στίλβοντος, καὶ ἡ
7 φωνὴ τῶν λόγων αὐτοῦ ὡς φωνὴ ὄχλου. Καὶ ἴδον ἐγὼ Δανιὴλ
μόνος τὴν ὀπτασίαν, καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες οἱ μετ᾽ ἐμοῦ οὐκ ἴδον τὴν

**9:25** to build Jerusalem, there shall be seven weeks, and sixty-two weeks, until Messiah the Prince; and it shall be restored, and the street shall be built, and the wall, and the times shall be emptied out.
**26** And after the sixty-two weeks, an anointed one shall be utterly destroyed, and there is no judgment in him; and the city and the sanctuary shall he destroy with the coming prince, and they shall be cut off in a flood, and until the end of a war cut off by the order of desolations.
**27** And he shall confirm a covenant with many for one week; and in the midst of the week he shall cause the altar and the sacrifice to cease. And until the wing from desolation, and until the completion and the hastening by order upon desolation; and he shall confirm a covenant with many for one week; and in the midst of the week my sacrifice and libation shall be taken away, and upon the sanctuary there shall be an abomination of desolations, and until the completion of time, a completion shall be given upon the desolation.

### Vision X.

**10:1** In the third year of Cyrus, King of Persia, a word was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belshazzar; and the word was true, and great conflict and understanding was given unto him in the vision.
**2** In those days I, Daniel, was mourning for three weeks of days.
**3** I ate no pleasant bread, neither came meat nor wine into my mouth, neither did I anoint myself with oil, until the fulfilment of three weeks of days.
**4** And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, I was by the side of the great river, which is the Tigris Hiddekel.
**5** And I lifted up mine eyes and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen,
**6** whose loins were girded with gold of Ophaz; and his body was like a Tarshish stone, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet as the appearance of burnished bronze, and the
**7** voice of his words as the voice of a multitude. And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, for the men that were with me saw not the vision;
