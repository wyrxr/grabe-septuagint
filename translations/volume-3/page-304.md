ΚΕΦ. ΙΖʹ.
μνησθῶσιν οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτῶν τῶν θυσιαστηρίων αὐτῶν, καὶ ἀλσῶν αὐ- 2
τῶν, ἐπὶ ξύλου δασέος, καὶ ἐπὶ βουνῶν μετεώρων, καὶ ὀρέων 3
ἐν ἀγρῷ· τὴν ἰσχύν σου, καὶ τοὺς θησαυρούς σου, εἰς προνομὴν
δώσω, καὶ τὰ ὑψηλά σου, διὰ τὰς ἁμαρτίας σου, τὰς ἐν πάσι
τοῖς ὁρίοις σου, καὶ ἀφεθήσῃ μόνη, καὶ ταπεινωθήσῃ ἀπὸ τῆς 4
κληρονομίας σου, ἧς ἔδωκά σοι· καὶ καταδουλώσω σε τοῖς ἐχθροῖς
σου ἐν τῇ γῇ, ᾗ οὐκ ἔγνως· ὅτι πῦρ ἐκκέκαυται ἐν τῷ θυμῷ
μου, ἕως αἰῶνος καυθήσεται. Ἐπικατάρατος ὁ ἄνθρωπος, ὃς 5
τὴν ἐλπίδα ἔχει ἐπ᾿ ἄνθρωπον, καὶ στηρίσει σάρκα βραχίονος
αὐτοῦ ἐπ᾿ αὐτόν, καὶ ἀπὸ Κυρίου ἀποστῇ ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ. Καὶ 6
ἔσται ὡς ἡ ἀγριομυρίκη ἡ ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, ἢ οὐκ ὄψεται ὅταν ἔλ-
θῃ τὰ ἀγαθά, καὶ κατασκηνώσει ἐν ἁλίμοις, καὶ ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, 7
ἐν γῇ ἁλμυρᾷ, ἥτις οὐ κατοικεῖται. Καὶ εὐλογημένος ὁ ἄνθρω- 8
πος, ὃς πέποιθεν ἐπὶ τῷ Κυρίῳ, καὶ ἔσται Κύριος ἐλπὶς αὐτοῦ,
καὶ ἔσται ὡς ξύλον εὐθηνοῦν παρ᾿ ὕδατα, καὶ ἐπὶ ἰχμάδα βα- 9
λεῖ ῥίζας αὐτοῦ· καὶ οὐ φοβηθήσεται, ὅταν ἔλθῃ καῦμα, καὶ
ἔσται ἐν αὐτῷ στελέχη ἀλσώδη, ἐν ἐνιαυτῷ ἀβροχίας οὐ φοβη-
θήσεται, καὶ οὐ διαλείψει ποιῶν καρπόν. Βαθεῖα ἡ καρδία παρὰ 10
πάντα, καὶ ἄνθρωπός ἐστι, καὶ τίς γνώσεται αὐτόν; Ἐγὼ Κύ-
ριος ἐτάζων καρδίας, καὶ δοκιμάζων νεφρούς, τοῦ δοῦναι ἑκά-
στῳ κατὰ τὰς ὁδοὺς αὐτοῦ, καὶ κατὰ τοὺς καρποὺς τῶν ἐπι-
τηδευμάτων αὐτοῦ. Ἐφώνησε πέρδιξ, συνήγαγεν ἃ οὐχ ἔτεκε, 11
ποιῶν πλοῦτον αὐτοῦ οὐ μετὰ κρίσεως, ἐν ἡμίσει ἡμερῶν αὐ-
τοῦ ἐγκαταλείψουσιν αὐτόν, καὶ ἐπ᾿ ἐσχάτων αὐτοῦ ἔσται ἄφρων.
Θρόνος δόξης ὑψούμενος ἐξ ἀρχῆς, τόπος ἁγιάσματος ἡμῶν, 12
ὑπομονὴ Ἰσραήλ· Κύριε, πάντες οἱ καταλείποντές σε καταισχυνθή- 13
τωσαν, ἀφεστηκότες ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς γραφήτωσαν, ὅτι ἐγκατέλι-
πον πηγὴν ζωῆς, τὸν Κύριον. Ἴασαί με Κύριε, καὶ ἰαθήσομαι· 14
σῶσόν με, καὶ σωθήσομαι, ὅτι καύχημά μου εἶ. Ἰδοὺ αὐτοὶ 15
λέγουσι πρὸς μέ· ποῦ ἐστιν ὁ λόγος Κυρίου, ἐλθάτω. Ἐγὼ δὲ 16
οὐκ ἐκοπίασα κατακολουθῶν ὀπίσω σου, καὶ ἡμέραν ἀνθρώπου 17
οὐκ ἐπεθύμησα· σὺ ἐπίστασαι τὰ ἐκπορευόμενα διὰ τῶν χειλέων
μου, πρὸ προσώπου σου ἐστί. Μὴ γεννηθῇς μοι εἰς ἀλλοτρίω- 18
σιν, φειδόμενός μου ἐν ἡμέρᾳ πονηρᾷ. Καταισχυνθήτωσαν οἱ
διώκοντές με, καὶ μὴ καταισχυνθείην ἐγώ· πτοηθήτωσαν αὐτοί,
καὶ μὴ πτοηθείην ἐγώ· ἐπάγαγε ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς ἡμέραν πονηράν, δια

### JEREMIAH 17

**2** when indeed their sons shall remember their altars, and their groves,
**3** upon a dense wood, and upon high hills, and [upon] mountains in the field. Thy strength, and thy treasures, I will give for a spoil, and thy high places [also], because of thy sins, [even those] which are in all thy borders.
**4** And thou shalt be forsaken alone, and thou shalt be humbled from thine inheritance, which I gave unto thee; and I will bring thee into bondage unto thine enemies in the land which thou hast not known; for a fire is kindled in My wrath,
**5** and it shall burn forever. Cursed is the man that trusteth in man, and doth lean the arm of his flesh upon him,
**6** and whose heart departeth from the Lord. And he shall be like the wild tamarisk in the wilderness, which shall not see when
**7** good things come, and shall dwell in salty places, and in the wilderness,
**8** in a salt land, which is not inhabited. Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord, and the Lord shall be his hope.
**9** And he shall be as a tree thriving by the waters, and by the moisture shall send forth its roots; and it shall not fear when heat cometh, and there shall be in it wooded trunks; in the year of drought it shall not fear,
**10** and it shall not cease from bearing fruit. Deep is the heart above all things, and it is man; and who shall know it? I, the Lord, do search the hearts, and test the reins, to give every man
**11** according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his devices. As a partridge crieth, and gathereth what it hath not brought forth, so he that maketh his wealth not with judgment, in the midst of his days
**12** shall they forsake him, and at his latter end he shall be a fool.
**13** A glorious throne, exalted from the beginning, a place of our sanctuary, the hope of Israel: O Lord, all that forsake Thee shall be ashamed;
**14** those that have turned away upon the earth, let them be written down, because they have forsaken the fountain of life, even the Lord.
**15** Heal me, O Lord, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved, for Thou art my boast.
**16** Behold, they say unto me, "Where is the word of the Lord? Let it come!"
**17** But as for me, I have not wearied myself following after Thee, and the day of man I have not desired. Thou knowest the things that proceed from my lips;
**18** they are before Thy face. Be Thou not unto me for an estrangement, [but rather be] sparing of me in an evil day. Let them be ashamed that persecute me, and let me not be ashamed; let them be dismayed, and let me not be dismayed; bring upon them an evil day, and utterly [bring them low].
