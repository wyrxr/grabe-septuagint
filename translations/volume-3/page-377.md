ΚΕΦ. ΝΒ´. ΙΕΡΕΜΙΑΣ 1315
πάντες αἱ ψυχὴ τέσσαρες χιλιάδες, καὶ ἑξακόσιαι. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν
31 τριακοστῷ καὶ ἑβδόμῳ ἔτει, ἀποικισθέντος τοῦ Ἰωακεὶμ βα-
σιλέως Ἰούδα, ἐν τῷ δωδεκάτῳ μηνὶ, ἐν τῇ τετράδι καὶ εἰκάδι τοῦ
μηνός, ἔλαβεν Οὐλαιμαραδὰχ βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος, ἐν τῷ ἐνιαυτῷ,
ᾧ ἐβασίλευσε, τὴν κεφαλὴν Ἰωακεὶμ βασιλέως Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐξή-
γαγεν αὐτὸν ἐξ οἰκίας, ἧς ἐφυλάττετο, καὶ ἐλάλησεν αὐτῷ χρηστὰ,
32 καὶ ἔδωκε τὸν θρόνον αὐτοῦ ἐπάνω τῶν θρόνων τῶν βασιλέων τῶν
μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἐν Βαβυλῶνι, καὶ ἤλλαξε τὴν στολὴν τῆς φυλακῆς αὐτοῦ,
33 καὶ ἤσθιεν ἄρτον διαπαντὸς κατὰ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ πάσας τὰς ἡμέ-
ρας, ἃς ἔζησε. Καὶ ἡ σύνταξις αὐτοῦ ταγὴ αὐτῷ ἐδίδετο διαπαντὸς
34 παρὰ τοῦ βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος, ἐξ ἡμέρας εἰς ἡμέραν, ἕως
ἡμέρας ἧς ἀπέθανε πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς ζωῆς αὐτοῦ.

**JEREMIAH 52**
[And] all the soul: four thousand and six hundred.
**31** And it came to pass in the thirty-and-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin, king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fourth [day] of the month, that Evil-Merodach, king of Babylon, in the year wherein he began to reign, did take the head of Jehoiachin, the king of Judah, and brought him forth from the house wherein he was guarded, and spoke kindly unto him.
**32** And he gave his throne [a place] above the thrones of the kings who were with him in Babylon,
**33** and he changed his prison garment; and he did eat bread continually before him all the days that he lived.
**34** And his allowance, an allowance unto him, was given continually by the king of Babylon, from day to day, until the day he died, all the days of his life.
