ΚΕΦ. ΚΓʹ.               ΙΕΡΕΜΙΑΣ                     1253
ἀσεβεῖς, καὶ οὐκ ἔτι ἀποστρέψει ὁ θυμὸς Κυρίου, ἕως ἂν ποιήσῃ αὐ- 20
τὸ, καὶ ἕως ἂν στήσῃ αὐτὸ, ἀπὸ ἐγχειρήματος καρδίας αὐτοῦ·
ἐπ’ ἐσχάτου τῶν ἡμερῶν νοήσουσιν αὐτὸ νοήσει. Οὐκ ἀπέστειλον 21
τοὺς προφήτας, καὶ αὐτοὶ ἔτρεχον· οὐκ ἐλάλησα πρὸς αὐτοὺς,
καὶ αὐτοὶ ἐπροφήτευον. Καὶ εἰ ἔστησαν ἐν τῇ ὑποστάσει μου, 22
καὶ εἰ ἤκουσαν τῶν λόγων μου, καὶ τὸν λαόν μου ἀποστρέφειν
αὐτοὺς ἐκ τῆς ὁδοῦ αὐτῶν τῆς πονηρᾶς, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ἐπιτη-
δευμάτων αὐτῶν τῶν πονηρῶν. Θεὸς ἐγγίζων ἐγώ εἰμι, λέγει 23
Κύριος, καὶ οὐ Θεὸς πόῤῥωθεν. Εἰ κρυβήσεται ἄνθρωπος 24
ἐν κρυφαίοις, καὶ ἐγὼ οὐκ ὄψομαι αὐτόν; φησὶ Κύριος· μὴ οὐχὶ
τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ τὴν γῆν ἐγὼ πληρῶ, λέγει Κύριος; Ἤκουσα ἃ 25
λαλοῦσιν οἱ προφῆται, ἃ προφητεύουσιν ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί μου, ψευ-
δῆ λέγοντες· ἐνυπνιασάμην ἐνύπνιον. Ἕως πότε ἔσται ἐν καρ- 26
δίᾳ τῶν προφητῶν τῶν προφητευόντων ψευδῆ, καὶ ἐν τῷ προφητεύ-
ειν αὐτοὺς τὰ θελήματα τῆς καρδίας αὐτῶν, τῶν λογιζομένων τοῦ 27
ἐπιλαθέσθαι τοῦ νόμου μου ἐν τοῖς ἐνυπνίοις αὐτῶν, ἃ διηγοῦνται
ἕκαστος τῷ πλησίον αὐτοῦ, καθάπερ ἐπελάθοντο οἱ πατέρες
αὐτῶν τοῦ ὀνόματός μου ἐν τῇ Βάαλ. Ὁ προφήτης, ἐν ᾧ τὸ ἐνύ- 28
πνιόν ἐστι, διηγησάσθω τὸ ἐνύπνιον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐν ᾧ ὁ λό-
γος μου πρὸς αὐτόν, διηγησάσθω τὸν λόγον μου ἐπ᾿ ἀληθείας·
τί τὸ ἄχυρον πρὸς τὸν σῖτον; φησὶ Κύριος. Οὕτως οἱ λόγοι μου, 29
λέγει Κύριος· οὐκ ἰδοὺ οἱ λόγοι μου, ὥσπερ φλέγον πῦρ, λέγει
Κύριος, καὶ ὡς πέλεκυς κόπτων πέτραν; Διὰ τοῦτο ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ 30
πρὸς τοὺς προφήτας, λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς, τοὺς κλέπτοντας τοὺς
λόγους μου ἕκαστος παρὰ τοῦ πλησίον αὐτοῦ. Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ πρὸς τοὺς 31
προφήτας, φησὶ Κύριος, τοὺς ἐκβάλλοντας προφητείαν γλώσσῃ,
καὶ νυστάζοντας νυσταγμὸν ἑαυτῶν. Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ πρὸς τοὺς προ- 32
φήτας τοὺς προφητεύοντας ψευδῆ ἐνύπνια, φησὶ Κύριος, καὶ δι-
ηγοῦντο αὐτὰ, καὶ ἐπλάνησαν λαόν μου ἐν τοῖς ψευδέσιv αὐτῶν,
καὶ ἐν τοῖς πλάνοις αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐγὼ οὐκ ἀπέστειλα αὐτοὺς, καὶ
οὐκ ἐνετειλάμην αὐτοῖς, καὶ ὠφέλειαν οὐκ ὠφελήσουσι τὸν λα-
ὸν τοῦτον. Καὶ ἐὰν ἐρωτήσωσι σε ὁ λαὸς οὗτος, ἢ ἱερεὺς, ἢ 33
προφήτης, λέγων· τί τὸ λῆμμα Κυρίου; καὶ ἐρεῖς αὐτοῖς· ὑμεῖς
ἐστε τὸ λῆμμα, καὶ ἐάσω ὑμᾶς, λέγει Κύριος. Ὁ προφή- 34
της, καὶ ὁ ἱερεὺς, καὶ ὁ λαὸς, οἳ ἂν εἴπωσι, λῆμμα Κυρίου, καὶ
ἐκδικήσω τὸν ἄνθρωπον ἐκεῖνον, καὶ τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΔ΄. XXIV.

1 ΚΑΙ ἔδειξέ μοι Κύριος δύο καλάθους σύκων, κειμένους κατὰ
    πρόσωπον ναοῦ Κυρίου, μετὰ τὸ ἀποικίσαι Ναβουχοδονόσορ βα-
    σιλέα Βαβυλῶνος τὸν Ἰεχονίαν υἱὸν Ἰωακεὶμ βασιλέα Ἰούδα,
    καὶ τοὺς ἄρχοντας βασιλέως Ἰούδα, καὶ τοὺς τεχνίτας, καὶ
    τοὺς δεσμώτας, καὶ τοὺς πλουσίους ἐξ Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἤγαγεν
2 αὐτοὺς εἰς Βαβυλῶνα. Ὁ κάλαθος ὁ εἷς σύκων χρηστῶν σφόδρα,
    ὡς τὰ σύκα τὰ πρώϊμα· καὶ ὁ κάλαθος ὁ ἕτερος σύκων πονη-
3 ρῶν σφόδρα, ἃ οὐ βρωθήσεται ἀπὸ πονηρίας αὐτῶν. Καὶ εἶπε
    Κύριος πρὸς μέ· τί σὺ ὁρᾷς Ἱερεμία; καὶ εἶπα, σύκα· καὶ τὰ
    σύκα τὰ χρηστά, χρηστὰ λίαν· καὶ τὰ πονηρά, πονηρὰ λίαν, ἃ οὐ
4 βρωθήσεται ἀπὸ πονηρίας αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου
5 πρὸς μὲ λέγων. Τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ· ὡς τὰ σύκα
    τὰ χρηστὰ ταῦτα, οὕτως ἐπιγνώσομαι τοὺς ἀποικισθέντας Ἰού-
    δα, οὓς ἐξαπέσταλκα ἐκ τοῦ τόπου τούτου εἰς γῆν Χαλδαίων
6 εἰς ἀγαθά. Καὶ στηριῶ τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς μου ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς εἰς ἀγα-
    θά, καὶ ἀποκαταστήσω αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν γῆν ταύτην εἰς ἀγαθά·

**Jeremiah 23**
**20** the ungodly, and the wrath of the Lord shall no longer turn back, until He perform it, and until He establish it, from the purpose of His heart. In the latter days they shall understand it with understanding.
**21** I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran; I have not spoken unto them, yet they prophesied.
**22** And if they had stood in My counsel, and if they had hearkened unto My words, [then would they have caused] My people to turn back from their evil way, and from their evil doings.
**23** Am I a God nigh at hand, saith the Lord, and not a God afar off?
**24** If a man should hide himself in secret places, shall I not see him? saith the Lord. Do I not fill heaven and earth? saith the Lord.
**25** I have heard what the prophets speak, what they prophesy in My Name, speaking lies, saying: 'I have dreamed a dream!'
**26** How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies, yea, in their prophesying the desires of their own heart,
**27** who scheme that My law should be forgotten by their dreams, which each one doth narrate unto his neighbor, just as their fathers forgot My Name through Baal?
**28** The prophet in whom there is a dream, let him tell his dream; and in whom My word is unto him, let him speak My word in truth. What is the chaff to the wheat? saith the Lord.
**29** So are My words, saith the Lord. Behold, are not My words like a burning fire, saith the Lord, and like a hammer that breaketh a rock?
**30** Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, saith the Lord God, who steal My words, each one from his neighbor.
**31** Behold, I am against the prophets, saith the Lord, who cast forth prophecy with the tongue, and dream their own dream.
**32** Behold, I am against the prophets who prophesy false dreams, saith the Lord, and they tell them, and they have led My people astray by their lies and by their deceptions. And I have not sent them, nor have I commanded them; therefore they shall not profit this people at all.
**33** And if this people, or a priest, or a prophet, shall ask thee, saying, 'What is the burden of the Lord?' then shalt thou say unto them: 'Ye yourselves are the burden, and I will cast you off,' saith the Lord.
**34** The prophet, and the priest, and the people, who shall say, 'The burden of the Lord', then will I visit that man with punishment, and his house.

**Jeremiah 24**
**1** And the Lord showed me two baskets of figs, set before the Temple of the Lord, after that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried away into exile Jechoniah the son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, and the princes of the king of Judah, with the craftsmen, and the prisoners, and the wealthy from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.
**2** One basket had very good figs, even as the first-ripe figs; and the other basket had very bad figs, which could not be eaten for their badness.
**3** And the Lord said unto me, 'What seest thou, Jeremiah?' And I said, 'Figs; and the good figs are exceedingly good, and the bad ones are exceedingly bad, which cannot be eaten for their badness.'
**4** And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
**5** 'Thus saith the Lord God of Israel: "Like these good figs, so will I regard the exiles of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for their good.
**6** For I will set Mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again unto this land for good;"
