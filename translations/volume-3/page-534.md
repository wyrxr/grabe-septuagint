ΚΕΦ. Δʹ. Εʹ.
9 Κύριος. Ἐπάταξα ὑμᾶς ἐν μυρώσει, καὶ ἐν ἰκτέρῳ· ἐπληθύνατε
   κήπους ὑμῶν, καὶ ἀμπελῶνας ὑμῶν καὶ συκῶνας ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐλαιῶ-
   νας ὑμῶν κατέφαγεν ἡ κάμπη, καὶ οὐδ᾿ ὡς ἐπεστρέψατε πρὸς μέ,
10 λέγει Κύριος. Ἐξαπέστειλα εἰς ὑμᾶς θάνατον ἐν ὁδῷ Αἰγύπτου,
   καὶ ἀπέκτεινα ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ τοὺς νεανίσκους ὑμῶν μετὰ αἰχμαλω-
   σίας ἵππων σου, καὶ ἀνήγαγον ἐν πυρὶ τὰς παρεμβολὰς ὑμῶν ἐν
   τῇ ὀργῇ μου, καὶ οὐδ᾿ ὡς ἐπεστρέψατε πρὸς μέ, λέγει Κύριος.
11 Κατέστρεψα ὑμᾶς, καθὼς κατέστρεψεν ὁ Θεὸς Σόδομα καὶ Γό-
   μοῤῥα, καὶ ἐγένεσθε ὡς δαλὸς ἐξεσπασμένος ἐκ πυρός, καὶ οὐδ᾿
12 ὡς ἐπεστρέψατε πρὸς μέ, λέγει Κύριος. Διὰ τοῦτο οὕτως ποιή-
   σω σοι Ἰσραήλ· πλὴν ὅτι οὕτως ποιήσω σοι, ἑτοίμαζου τοῦ ἐπι-
13 καλεῖσθαι τὸν Θεόν σου Ἰσραήλ· διότι ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ στερεῶν βροντὴν,
   καὶ κτίζων πνεῦμα, καὶ ἀπαγγέλλων εἰς ἀνθρώπους τὸν χριστὸν
   αὐτοῦ, ποιῶν ὄρθρον καὶ ὁμίχλην, καὶ ἐπιβαίνων ἐπὶ τὰ ὕψη τῆς
   γῆς· Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὁ παντοκράτωρ ὄνομα αὐτῷ.

                    ΚΕΦ. Εʹ. V.

1 ἈΚΟΥΣΑΤΕ τὸν λόγον Κυρίου τοῦτον, ὃν ἐγὼ λαμβάνω ἐφ᾿
2 ὑμᾶς θρῆνον· οἶκος Ἰσραὴλ ἔπεσεν, οὐκέτι μὴ προσθῇ τοῦ ἀνα-
   στῆναι· παρθένος τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ ἔσφαλεν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς αὐτῆς, οὐκ
3 ἔστιν ὁ ἀναστήσων αὐτήν. Διότι τάδε λέγει Κύριος Κύριος· ἡ
   πόλις ἐξ ἧς ἐξεπορεύοντο χίλιοι, ὑπολειφθήσονται ἑκατόν· καὶ ἐξ
   ἧς ἐξεπορεύοντο ἑκατὸν, ὑπολειφθήσονται δέκα τῷ οἴκῳ Ἰσραήλ.
4 Διότι τάδε λέγει Κύριος πρὸς τὸν οἶκον Ἰσραήλ· ἐκζητή-
5 σατέ με, καὶ ζήσεσθε· καὶ μὴ ἐκζητεῖτε Βαιθήλ, καὶ εἰς
   Γάλγαλα μὴ εἰσπορεύεσθε, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸ φρέαρ τοῦ ὅρκου μὴ δια-
   βαίνετε· ὅτι Γάλγαλα αἰχμαλωτευομένη αἰχμαλωτευθήσεται, καὶ
6 Βαιθήλ ἔσται ὡς οὐχ ὑπάρχουσα. Ἐκζητήσατε τὸν Κύριον, καὶ
   ζήσατε, ὅπως μὴ ἀναλάμψῃ ὡς πῦρ ὁ οἶκος Ἰωσήφ, καὶ κατα-
7 φάγῃ αὐτὸν, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ὁ σβέσων τῷ οἴκῳ Ἰσραήλ. Κύριος (ὁ
   Θεὸς) ὁ ποιῶν εἰς ὕψος κρίμα καὶ δικαιοσύνην εἰς γῆν ἔθηκεν·
8 ποιῶν πάντα καὶ μετασκευάζων, καὶ ἐκτρέπων εἰς πρωῒ σκίαν,
   καὶ ἡμέραν εἰς νύκτα συσκοτάζων· ὁ προσκαλούμενος τὸ ὕδωρ
   τῆς θαλάσσης, καὶ ἐκχέων αὐτὸ ἐπὶ προσώπου τῆς γῆς· Κύριος
9 ὁ Θεὸς ὁ παντοκράτωρ ὄνομα αὐτῷ· ὁ διαιρῶν συντριμμὸν ἐπὶ

**CHAPTER 4**

**9** Saith the Lord: I have smitten you with wasting sickness, and with jaundice; though your gardens, and your vineyards, and your fig-trees, and your olive-groves did multiply, yet the caterpillar consumed them; and even so ye returned not unto Me, saith the Lord.
**10** I have sent among you death after the manner of Egypt; and I have slain with the sword your young men, with the captivity of thy horses; and I caused your encampments to ascend in flame in My wrath; and even so ye returned not unto Me, saith the Lord.
**11** I have overthrown you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah; and ye were as a brand plucked from the fire; and even so ye returned not unto Me, saith the Lord.
**12** Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel; nevertheless, seeing that thus will I do unto thee, prepare thee to call upon thy God, O Israel!
**13** For behold, I am He who establisheth the thunder, and createth the spirit, and declareth unto men His Christ, who maketh the dawn and the mist, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth: the Lord, the God Almighty, is His Name.

**CHAPTER 5**

**1** Hear ye this word of the Lord, which I lift up over you, a lamentation:
**2** The house of Israel is fallen, it shall no more rise again; the virgin of Israel hath stumbled upon her own land, there is none to raise her up.
**3** For thus saith the Lord God: The city from which went forth a thousand, there shall be left an hundred; and from which went forth an hundred, there shall be left ten to the house of Israel.
**4** For thus saith the Lord unto the house of Israel: Seek ye Me, and ye shall live;
**5** And seek not Bethel, and into Gilgal enter ye not, and to the well of the oath pass ye not over; for Gilgal, being led captive, shall assuredly be led captive,
**6** And Bethel shall be as though it were not. Seek ye the Lord, and live, lest the house of Joseph flash forth as fire, and consume it;
**7** And there shall be none to quench it for the house of Israel. The Lord [God],
**8** He that establisheth judgment in the height, and hath laid righteousness upon the earth; who maketh all things and transformeth them; and turneth morning into shadow, and darkeneth day into night; who calleth for the water of the sea, and poureth it out upon the face of the earth; the Lord, the God Almighty, is His Name:
**9** He that divideth destruction upon...
