κά μοι, ἐλάλησαν ματαιότητας, καὶ δολιότητας ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν
ἐμελέτησαν. ᾽Εγὼ δὲ ὡσεὶ κωφὸς οὐκ ἤκουον, καὶ ὡσεὶ ἄλαλος οὐκ 14
ἀνοίγων τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐγενόμην ὡσεὶ ἄνθρωπος οὐκ ἀκούων, 15
καὶ οὐκ ἔχων ἐν τῷ στόματι αὐτοῦ ἐλεγμούς. Ὅτι ἐπὶ σοὶ Κύριε 16
ἤλπισα, σὺ εἰσακούσῃ Κύριε ὁ Θεός μου. Ὅτι εἶπα, μήποτε ἐπι- 17
χαρῶσί μοι οἱ ἐχθροί μου· καὶ ἐν τῷ σαλευθῆναι πόδας μου, ἐπ᾽
ἐμὲ ἐμεγαλοῤῥημόνησαν. Ὅτι ἐγὼ εἰς μάστιγας ἔτοιμος, καὶ ἡ ἀλ- 18
γηδών μου ἐνώπιον μου (ἐστὶ) διαπαντός. Ὅτι τὴν ἀνομίαν μου 19
(ἐγὼ) ἀναγγελῶ, καὶ μεριμνήσω ὑπὲρ τῆς ἁμαρτίας μου. Οἱ δὲ 20
ἐχθροί μου ζῶσι, καὶ κεκραταίωνται ὑπὲρ ἐμέ, καὶ ἐπληθύνθησαν
οἱ μισοῦντές με ἀδίκως· οἱ ἀνταποδιδόντες (μοι) κακὰ ἀντὶ ἀγα- 21
θῶν ἐνδιέβαλλόν με, ἐπεὶ κατεδίωκον ἀγαθωσύνην. Μὴ ἐγκαταλί- 22
πῃς με Κύριε ὁ Θεός μου, μὴ ἀποστῇς ἀπ᾽ ἐμοῦ· πρόσχες εἰς τὴν 23
βοήθειάν μου, Κύριε τῆς σωτηρίας μου.

Εἰς τὸ τέλος, τῷ ᾽Ιδιθοὺν ᾠδὴ τῷ Δαυΐδ. Εἶπα, φυλάξω 1.2
τὰς ὁδούς μου, τοῦ μὴ ἁμαρτάνειν (με) ἐν γλώσσῃ μου· ἐθέμην τῷ
στόματί μου φυλακήν, ἐν τῷ συστῆναι τὸν ἁμαρτωλὸν ἐναντίον
μου. ᾽Εκωφώθην καὶ ἐταπεινώθην, καὶ ἐσίγησα ἐξ ἀγαθῶν, καὶ 3
τὸ ἄλγημά μου ἀνεκαίνισθη. ᾽Εθερμάνθη ἡ καρδία μου ἐντός μου, 4
καὶ ἐν τῇ μελέτῃ μου ἐκκαυθήσεται πῦρ· ἐλάλησα ἐν γλώσσῃ μου.
Γνώρισόν μοι Κύριε τὸ πέρας μου, καὶ τὸν ἀριθμὸν τῶν ἡμερῶν 5
μου τίς ἐστιν, ἵνα γνῶ τί ὑστερῶ ἐγώ. ᾽Ιδοὺ παλαιὰς ἔθου τὰς 6
ἡμέρας μου, καὶ ἡ ὑπόστασίς μου ὡσεὶ οὐδὲν ἐνώπιόν σου· πλὴν
τὸ σύμπαντα ματαιότης πᾶς ἄνθρωπος ζῶν. Διάψαλμα. Μέν- 7
τοιγε ἐν εἰκόνι διαπορεύεται ἄνθρωπος, πλὴν μάτην ταράσσεται·
θησαυρίζει, καὶ οὐ γινώσκει τίνι συνάγει αὐτά. Καὶ νῦν τίς ἡ 8
ὑπομονή μου; οὐχὶ ὁ Κύριος; καὶ ἡ ὑπόστασίς μου παρὰ σοί ἐστιν.
᾽Απὸ πασῶν τῶν ἀνομιῶν μου ῥῦσαί με· ὄνειδος ἄφρονι ἔδωκάς με. 9
᾽Εκωφώθην καὶ οὐκ ἤνοιξα τὸ στόμα μου, ὅτι σὺ ἐποίησάς (με). 10
᾽Απόστησον ἀπ᾽ ἐμοῦ τὰς μάστιγάς σου· ἀπὸ (γὰρ) τῆς ἰσχύος 11
τῆς χειρός σου ἐγὼ ἐξέλιπον. ᾽Εν ἐλεγμοῖς ὑπὲρ ἀνομίας ἐπαί- 12

πλὴν μάτην πᾶς ἄνθρωπος. Διάψαλμα. Εἰσάκουσον τῆς προσευ- 13

**PSALM XXXVII.**

13 (Cont.) ...[to do] me evil; they spoke vain things, and deceitful things they meditated all the day long.
14 But I, as one deaf, heard not; and as a mute, I opened not my mouth.
15 And I became as a man that heareth not, and that hath no reproofs in his mouth.
16 For in Thee, O Lord, have I hoped; Thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.
17 For I said, "Lest at any time my enemies rejoice over me"; and when my feet were moved, they magnified themselves against me.
18 For I am ready for scourges; and my pain is ever before me.
19 For I will declare mine iniquity, and I will be anxious concerning my sin.
20 But mine enemies live, and are strengthened above me; and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.
21 They that render me evil for good slandered me, because I pursued goodness.
22 Forsake me not, O Lord my God; depart not from me.
23 Give heed to my help, O Lord of my salvation.

**PSALM XXXVIII.**

1.2 To the End, for Idithun, a Psalm of David.
I said, "I will guard my ways, that I sin not with my tongue";
I set a guard to my mouth, when the sinner stood before me.
3 I was dumb and humbled, and I held my peace from good things;
And my pain was renewed.
4 My heart grew hot within me; and in my meditation a fire shall be kindled:
I spake with my tongue.
5 Make known unto me, O Lord, mine end,
And the measure of my days, what it is;
That I may know how fleeting I am.
6 Behold, Thou hast made my days as a short span,
And my substance is as nothing before Thee:
Verily, the sum of all things is vanity, every living man. Selah.
7 Surely in an image doth man walk,
Yet in vain is he troubled:
He storeth up treasures, and knoweth not for whom he gathereth them.
8 And now, what is my hope? Is it not the Lord?
And my substance is with Thee.
9 Deliver me from all mine iniquities:
Make me not a reproach to the foolish.
10 I was dumb, and I opened not my mouth;
Because Thou hast made it so.
11 Remove Thy scourges from me:
For by the might of Thy hand I am consumed.
12 With rebukes for iniquity hast Thou disciplined man,
And hast consumed his soul as a spider's web:
Verily, every man is vanity. Selah.
13 Hearken unto my prayer, O Lord,
