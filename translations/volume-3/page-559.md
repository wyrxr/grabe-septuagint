ΚΕΦ. Δ΄. Ι Ω Ν Α Σ. 1497
ἀνέβη ὑπὲρ κεφαλῆς τοῦ Ἰωνᾶ, τοῦ εἶναι σκιὰν ὑπεράνω τῆς κε-
φαλῆς αὐτοῦ, τοῦ σκιάζειν αὐτῷ ἀπὸ τῶν κακῶν αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐχά-
ρη Ἰωνᾶς ἐπὶ τῇ κολοκύντῃ χαρὰν μεγάλην. Καὶ προσέταξε Κύ- 7
ριος ὁ Θεὸς σκώληκι ἐωθινῇ τῇ ἐπαύριον, καὶ ἐπάταξε τὴν κο-
λοκύνταν, καὶ ἀπεξηράνθη. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἅμα τῷ ἀνατεῖλαι τὸν 8
ἥλιον, καὶ προσέταξε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς πνεύματι καύσωνι συγκάιοντι,
καὶ ἐπάταξεν ὁ ἥλιος ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν Ἰωνᾶ· καὶ ὠλιγοψύχησε,
καὶ ἀπελέγετο τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπε· καλόν μοι τὸ ἀπο-
θανεῖν με, ἢ ζῆν. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς πρὸς Ἰωνᾶν· εἰ σφό- 9
δρα λελύπησαι σὺ ἐπὶ τῇ κολοκύντῃ; Καὶ εἶπε· σφόδρα λελύ-
πημαι ἐγὼ ἕως θανάτου. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος· σὺ ἐφείσω ὑπὲρ τῆς 10
κολοκύντης, ὑπὲρ ἧς οὐκ ἐκακοπάθησας ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς, καὶ οὐκ ἐξέθρε-
ψας αὐτήν, ἣ ὑπὸ νύκτα ἐγενήθη, καὶ ὑπὸ νύκτα ἀπώλετο· ἐγὼ 11
δὲ οὐ φείσομαι ὑπὲρ Νινευὴ τῆς πόλεως τῆς μεγάλης, ἐν ᾗ κα-
τοικοῦσι πλείους ἢ δώδεκα μυριάδες ἀνθρώπων, οἵ τινες οὐκ ἔγνω-
σαν δεξιὰν αὐτῶν οὐδὲ ἀριστερὰν αὐτῶν, καὶ κτήνη πολλά;

JONAH
CHAPTER IV

**6** ...it grew up above the head of Jonah, that there might be a shade over his head, to shade him from his harms; and Jonah rejoiced with a great joy over the gourd.
**7** And the LORD God appointed a worm [at] early dawn on the morrow; and it smote the gourd, and it withered.
**8** And it came to pass, when the sun arose, that the LORD God commanded a scorching, burning wind; and the sun smote upon the head of Jonah; and he grew faint of heart, and desired his life [to depart], and said, "It is better for me to die than to live."
**9** Then the LORD God said unto Jonah, "Art thou greatly grieved concerning the gourd?" And he said, "I am greatly grieved, even unto death."
**10** Then said the LORD, "Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for which thou didst not labor, neither didst thou make it grow; which sprang forth in a night, and in a night perished.
**11** And shall not I have pity on Nineveh, that great city, wherein dwell more than twelve myriads of men, who know not their right hand from their left, and also many beasts?"
