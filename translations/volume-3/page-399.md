ΚΕΦ. Ζ'. ΙΕΖΕΚΙΗΛ 1337
κρινῶ σε ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς σου, καὶ δώσω τά σου.
9 Οὐ φείσεται ὁ ὀφθαλμός μου, οὐδὲ μὴ ἐλεήσω· διότι τὰς ὁδοὺς σου ἐπὶ σὲ δώσω, καὶ τὰ βδελύγματά σου ἐν μέσῳ σου ἔσονται, καὶ ἐπιγνώσῃ, διότι ἐγώ εἰμι Κύριος ὁ τύπτων.
10 Ἰδοὺ ἡμέρα Κυρίου, ἰδοὺ τὸ πέρας ἥκει, ἐξῆλθεν ἡ πλοκή, καὶ ἤνθηκεν ἡ ῥάβδος, ἐξανέστηκεν ἡ ὕβρις, καὶ συντρίψει στήριγμα ἀνόμου, καὶ οὐ μετὰ θορύβων, οὐδὲ μετὰ σπουδῆς.
11 Καὶ οὐκ ἐξ αὐτῶν εἰσιν, οὐδὲ ὡραισμὸς ἐν αὐτοῖς.
12 Ἤκει ὁ καιρὸς, ἰδοὺ ἡ ἡμέρα· ὁ κτώμενος μὴ χαιρέτω, καὶ ὁ πωλῶν μὴ θρηνείτω· ὅτι ὀργὴ εἰς πᾶν τὸ πλῆθος αὐτῆς.
13 Διότι ὁ κτώμενος πρὸς τὸν πωλοῦντα οὐκέτι οὐ μὴ ἐπιστρέψῃ, καὶ ἔτι ἐν ζωῇ τὸ ζῆν αὐτῶν, ὅτι ὅρασις εἰς πᾶν τὸ πλῆθος αὐτῆς οὐκ ἀνακάμψει, καὶ ἄνθρωπος ἐν ὀφθαλμῷ ζωῆς αὐτοῦ οὐ κρατήσει.
14 Σαλπίσατε ἐν σάλπιγγι, κρίνατε τὰ σύμπαντα, καὶ οὐκ ἔστι πορευόμενος εἰς τὸν πόλεμον, ὅτι ἡ ὀργή μου εἰς πᾶν τὸ πλῆθος αὐτῆς.
15 Ὁ πόλεμος ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ ἔξωθεν, καὶ ὁ λιμὸς καὶ ὁ θάνατος ἔσωθεν· οἱ ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ τελευτήσουσι, τοὺς δὲ ἐν τῇ πόλει λιμὸς καὶ θάνατος συντελέσει.
16 Καὶ ἀνασωθήσονται οἱ ἀνασωζόμενοι ἐξ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔσονται ἐπὶ τῶν ὀρέων, ὡς περιστεραὶ μηλετητικαί· πάντας ἀποκτενῶ, ἕκαστον ἐν ταῖς ἀδικίαις αὐτοῦ.
17 Πᾶσαι χεῖρες ἐκλυθήσονται, καὶ πάντες μηροὶ μολυνθήσονται ὑγρασία,
18 καὶ περιζώσονται σάκκους, καὶ καλύψει αὐτοὺς θάμβος· καὶ ἐπὶ πᾶν πρόσωπον αἰσχύνη ἐπ’ αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἐπὶ πᾶσαν κεφαλὴν ψαλάκρωμα.
19 Τὸ ἀργύριον αὐτῶν ῥιφήσεται ἐν ταῖς πλατείαις, καὶ τὸ χρυσίον αὐτῶν ὑπεροφθήσεται. Τὸ ἀργύριον αὐτῶν καὶ τὸ χρυσίον αὐτῶν οὐ δυνηθήσεται ἐξελέσθαι αὐτοὺς ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ὀργῆς Κυρίου· αἱ ψυχαὶ αὐτῶν οὐ μὴ ἐμπλησθῶσι, καὶ αἱ κοιλίαι αὐτῶν οὐ μὴ πληρωθῶσι, διότι βάσανος τῶν ἀδικιῶν αὐτῶν ἐγένετο.
20 Ἐκλεκτὰ κόσμου εἰς ὑπερηφανίαν ἔθεντο αὐτὰ, καὶ εἰκόνας τῶν βδελυγμάτων αὐτῶν ἐποίησαν ἐξ αὐτῶν· ἕνεκεν τούτου δέδωκα αὐτὰ αὐτοῖς εἰς ἀκαθαρσίαν.
21 Καὶ παραδώσω αὐτὰ εἰς χεῖρας ἀλλοτρίων, τοῦ διαρπάσαι αὐτὰ, καὶ τοῖς λοιμοῖς τῆς γῆς εἰς σκῦλα, καὶ βελώσσουσιν αὐτά.
22 Καὶ ἀποστρέψω τὸ πρόσωπόν μου ἀπ’ αὐτῶν, καὶ μιανοῦσι τὴν ἐπισκοπήν μου, καὶ εἰσελεύσονται εἰς αὐτὰ ἀφυλάκτως, καὶ βεβηλώσουσιν αὐτά, καὶ ποιήσουσι φυρμόν·
23 διότι ἡ γῆ πλήρης λαῶν, καὶ ἡ πόλις πλήρης ἀνομίας·
24 καὶ ἄξω πονηροὺς ἐθνῶν, καὶ κληρονομήσουσι τοὺς οἴκους αὐτῶν· καὶ ἀποστρέψω τὸ φρύαγμα τῆς ἰσχύος αὐτῶν, καὶ μιανθήσεται τὰ ἅγια αὐτῶν.
25 Ἐξιλασμὸς ἥξει, καὶ ζητήσει (εἰς) εἰρήνην, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται.
26 Οὐαὶ ἐπὶ οὐαὶ ἔσται, καὶ ἀγγελία ἐπὶ ἀγγελίαν ἔσται, καὶ ζητηθήσεται ὅρασις ἐκ προφήτου, καὶ νόμος ἀπολεῖται ἐξ ἱερέως, καὶ βουλὴ ἐκ πρεσβυτέρων.
27 Ὁ βασιλεὺς πενθήσει, καὶ ὁ ἄρχων ἐνδύσεται ἀφανισμόν, καὶ αἱ χεῖρες τοῦ λαοῦ τῆς γῆς παραλυθήσονται· κατὰ τοὺς ὁδοὺς αὐτῶν πείσω αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἐν τοῖς κρίμασιν αὐτῶν ἐκδικήσω αὐτοὺς, καὶ γνώσονται ὅτι ἐγὼ Κύριος.

### Chapter 7

**8** ...I will judge thee according to thy ways, and I will bring upon thee thy [deeds].
**9** My eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity; for I will bring thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in thy midst, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord who smiteth.
**10** Behold, the day of the Lord, behold, the end is come; the snare hath gone forth, and the rod hath blossomed, arrogance hath arisen, and it shall crush the support of the lawless, yet not with tumultuous shouting, nor with haste.
**11** And they are not of them, nor is there comeliness among them.
**12** The time is come; behold, the day! Let him that acquireth not rejoice, and let him that selleth not mourn; for wrath is upon all its multitude.
**13** For he that acquireth shall no more return unto him that selleth, even whilst their life yet liveth; for the vision concerning all its multitude shall not return, and no man in his living eye shall take hold [of it].
**14** Sound the trumpet! Prepare all things! But there is none that goeth forth to the battle; for My wrath is upon all its multitude.
**15** The sword of war is without, and famine and death are within; those in the field shall perish by the sword, and those in the city shall be consumed by famine and death.
**16** And those that escape from among them shall escape, and they shall be upon the mountains, as doves [which are] mournful; I will slay all, each man in his iniquities.
**17** All hands shall be slackened, and all thighs shall be defiled with moisture,
**18** and they shall gird themselves with sackcloth, and dread shall cover them; and upon every face shall be shame upon them, and upon every head baldness.
**19** Their silver shall be cast into the streets, and their gold shall be esteemed as naught. Their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the Lord; their souls shall not be satisfied, and their bellies shall not be filled, for the torment of their iniquities is come to pass.
**20** The choicest things of the world they made into pride, and images of their abominations they made out of them; for this cause have I given them unto them for uncleanness.
**21** And I will deliver them into the hands of strangers, to plunder them, and unto the remnants of the land for spoil, and they shall profane them.
**22** And I will turn My face from them, and they shall defile My sanctuary; and they shall enter into them without guard, and they shall profane them, and shall make a confusion;
**23** for the land is full of people, and the city is full of iniquity.
**24** And I will bring the wicked of the nations, and they shall inherit their houses; and I will turn away the roaring of their strength, and their holy places shall be defiled.
**25** Calamity shall come, and [they] shall seek for peace, but it shall not be.
**26** Woe upon woe shall be, and tidings upon tidings shall be, and a vision from a prophet shall be sought, and the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.
**27** The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be paralyzed; according to their ways will I deal with them, and in their judgments will I requite them, and they shall know that I am the Lord.
