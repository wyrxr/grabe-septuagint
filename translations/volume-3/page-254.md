**9.** με; ἰδοὺ πάντες ὑμεῖς ὡς ἱμάτιον παλαιωθήσεσθε, καὶ ὡς σὴς
**10.** καταφάγεται ὑμᾶς. Τίς ἐν ὑμῖν ὁ φοβούμενος τὸν Κύριον; ἀ-
κουσάτω τῆς φωνῆς τοῦ παιδὸς αὐτοῦ· οἱ πορευόμενοι ἐν σκό-
τει, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν αὐτοῖς φῶς, πεποίθατε ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι Κυ-
**11.** ρίου, καὶ ἀντιστηρίσασθε ἐπὶ τῷ Θεῷ ὑμῶν. Ἰδοὺ πάντες ὑ-
μεῖς πῦρ καίετε, καὶ κατισχύετε φλόγα· πορεύεσθε τῷ φωτὶ τοῦ
πυρὸς ὑμῶν, καὶ τῇ φλογὶ ᾗ ἐξεκαύσατε· δι᾽ ἐμὲ ἐγένετο ταῦτα
ὑμῖν, ἐν λύπῃ κοιμηθήσεσθε.

**1.** Ἀκούσατέ μου, οἱ διώκοντες τὸ δίκαιον, καὶ ζητοῦντες τὸν
Κύριον, ἐμβλέψατε εἰς τὴν στερεὰν πέτραν, ἣν ἐλατομήσατε, καὶ
**2.** εἰς τὸν βόθυνον τοῦ λάκκου, ὃν ὠρύξατε. Ἐμβλέψατε εἰς Ἀ-
βραὰμ τὸν πατέρα ὑμῶν, καὶ εἰς Σάρραν τὴν ὠδίνουσαν ὑμᾶς·
ὅτι εἷς ἦν, καὶ ἐκάλεσα αὐτόν, καὶ ηὐλόγησα αὐτόν, καὶ ἠγά-
πησα αὐτόν, καὶ ἐπλήθυνα αὐτόν. **3.** Καὶ σὲ νῦν παρακαλέσω,
Σιών, καὶ παρεκάλεσα πάντα τὰ ἔρημα αὐτῆς, καὶ θήσω τὰ
ἔρημα αὐτῆς ὡς παράδεισον, καὶ τὰ πρὸς δυσμὰς αὐτῆς ὡς
παράδεισον Κυρίου· εὐφροσύνην καὶ ἀγαλλίαμα εὑρήσουσιν ἐν
**4.** αὐτῇ, ἐξομολόγησιν καὶ φωνὴν αἰνέσεως. Ἀκούσατέ μου, ἀ-
κούσατε λαός μου, καὶ οἱ βασιλεῖς πρός με ἐνωτίσασθε, ὅτι
νόμος παρ᾽ ἐμοῦ ἐξελεύσεται, καὶ ἡ κρίσις μου, εἰς φῶς ἐθνῶν.
**5.** Ἐγγίζει ταχὺ ἡ δικαιοσύνη μου, καὶ ἐξελεύσεται τὸ σωτήριόν
μου, καὶ εἰς τὸν βραχίονά μου ἔθνη ἐλπιοῦσιν· ἐμὲ νῆσοι ὑπο-
μενοῦσι, καὶ εἰς τὸν βραχίονά μου ἐλπιοῦσιν. **6.** Ἄρατε εἰς τὸν
οὐρανὸν τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐμβλέψατε εἰς τὴν γῆν κά-
τω, ὅτι ὁ οὐρανὸς ὡς καπνὸς ἐστερεώθη, καὶ ἡ γῆ ὡς ἱμάτιον
παλαιωθήσεται, οἱ δὲ κατοικοῦντες τὴν γῆν ὥσπερ ταῦτα ἀπο-
θανοῦνται, τὸ δὲ σωτήριόν μου εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα ἔσται, ἡ δὲ δικαιο-
**7.** σύνη μου οὐ μὴ ἐκλείπῃ. Ἀκούσατέ μου, οἱ εἰδότες κρίσιν, λαός
μου, οὗ ὁ νόμος μου ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ ὑμῶν, μὴ φοβεῖσθε ὀνειδισμὸν
**8.** ἀνθρώπων, καὶ τῷ φαυλισμῷ αὐτῶν μὴ ἡττᾶσθε. Ὥσπερ γὰρ
ἱμάτιον βρωθήσεται ὑπὸ χρόνου, καὶ ὥσπερ ἔρια βρωθήσεται
ὑπὸ σητός, ἡ δὲ δικαιοσύνη μου εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα ἔσται, τὸ δὲ σω-
**9.** τήριόν μου εἰς γενεὰς γενεῶν. Ἐξεγείρου, ἐξεγείρου Ἱερουσα-

#### Chapter 50

**9** who then shall do Me evil?
    Behold, all ye shall wax old as a garment,
    and the moth shall devour you.
**10** Who among you feareth the Lord?
    Let him hearken unto the voice of His servant.
    They that walk in darkness, and have no light,
    let them trust in the Name of the Lord,
    and stay themselves upon their God.
**11** Behold, all ye that kindle a fire,
    and strengthen a flame;
    walk ye in the light of your fire,
    and in the flame which ye have kindled.
    By My doing have these things come upon you;
    in sorrow shall ye lie down.

#### Chapter 51

**1** Hearken unto Me, ye that pursue righteousness,
    and seek the Lord.
    Look unto the solid Rock whence ye were hewn,
    and to the depth of the pit whence ye were digged.
**2** Look unto Abraham your father,
    and unto Sarah that bore you;
    for he was but one when I called him,
    and I blessed him, and loved him, and multiplied him.
**3** And now I will comfort thee, O Zion;
    and I have comforted all her desolate places;
    and I will make her desolate places as a paradise,
    and her western parts as the paradise of the Lord.
    Joy and exultation shall they find therein,
    with thanksgiving and the voice of praise.
**4** Hearken unto Me, O hear, My people;
    and ye kings, give ear unto Me;
    for a Law shall proceed from Me,
    and My judgment, for a light to the nations.
**5** My righteousness draweth nigh speedily,
    and My salvation shall go forth;
    and the nations shall hope in My arm.
    The islands shall await Me,
    and in My arm shall they hope.
**6** Lift up your eyes to the heaven,
    and look upon the earth beneath;
    for the heaven was made firm as smoke,
    and the earth shall wax old as a garment.
    And they that dwell in the earth shall die like these things;
    but My salvation shall be for ever,
    and My righteousness shall not fail.
**7** Hearken unto Me, ye that know judgment,
    My people, in whose heart is My Law;
    fear ye not the reproach of men,
    neither be ye overcome by their reviling.
**8** For as a garment shall be consumed by time,
    and as wool shall be eaten by the moth;
    so My righteousness shall be for ever,
    and My salvation unto generations of generations.
**9** Awake, awake, O Jerusa-
