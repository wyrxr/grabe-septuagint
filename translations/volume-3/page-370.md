γύπτου ἐνοικεῖν ἐκεῖ, ἐκλείψουσιν ἐν τῇ ῥομφαίᾳ, καὶ ἐν τῷ λιμῷ
καὶ ἐν θανάτῳ, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται αὐτῶν οὐδεὶς σῳζόμενος ἀπὸ τῶν
18 κακῶν, ὧν ἐγὼ ἐπάγω ἐπ᾿ αὐτούς. Ὅτι οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος τῶν
δυνάμεων ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ· ὅτι καθὼς ἔσταξεν ὁ θυμός μου καὶ ἡ
ὀργή μου ἐπὶ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας Ἱερουσαλήμ, οὕτως στάξει ὁ θυ-
μός μου ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς, εἰσελθόντων ὑμῶν εἰς Αἴγυπτον· καὶ ἔσεσθε εἰς
ἀπάτην, καὶ ὑποχείριοι, καὶ εἰς ἀράν, καὶ εἰς ὀνειδισμόν, καὶ οὐ μὴ
19 ἴδητε οὐκέτι τὸν τόπον τοῦτον, ἃ ἐλάλησε Κύριος ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς τοὺς κα-
ταλοίπους Ἰούδα, μὴ εἰσέλθητε εἰς Αἴγυπτον· καὶ νῦν γνόντες
20 γνώσεσθε ὅτι διεμαρτυράμην ὑμῖν σήμερον· ὅτι ἐπονηρεύσασθε ἐν
ταῖς ψυχαῖς ὑμῶν ἀποστείλαντές με πρὸς Κύριον τὸν Θεὸν ὑμῶν,
λέγοντες· πρόσευξαι περὶ ἡμῶν πρὸς Κύριον τὸν Θεὸν ἡμῶν, καὶ
κατὰ πάντα ἃ ἂν λαλήσῃ σοι Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν, οὕτως ἀπάγ-
21 γειλον ἡμῖν, καὶ ποιήσομεν. Καὶ ἀπήγγειλα ὑμῖν σήμερον, καὶ
οὐκ εἰσηκούσατε τῆς φωνῆς Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ὑμῶν, ἧς ἀπέστειλέ
22 με πρὸς ὑμᾶς. Καὶ νῦν ἴστε γινώσκοντες, ὅτι ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ καὶ
ἐν λιμῷ καὶ ἐν θανάτῳ ἐκλείψετε ἐν τῷ τόπῳ, οὗ ὑμεῖς βού-
λεσθε εἰσελθεῖν κατοικεῖν ἐκεῖ.

(Hebr. XLIII).

1 ΚΑΙ ἐγενήθη, ὡς ἐπαύσατο Ἱερεμίας λέγων πρὸς πάντα τὸν λαὸν
πάντας τοὺς λόγους Κυρίου Θεοῦ αὐτῶν, οὓς ἀπέστειλεν αὐτὸν Κύ-
2 ριος ὁ Θεὸς αὐτῶν πρὸς αὐτοὺς πάντας τοὺς λόγους τούτους, καὶ
εἶπεν Ἀζαρίας υἱὸς Μαασαίου, καὶ Ἰωάναν υἱὸς Κάρηε, καὶ
πάντες οἱ ἄνδρες οἱ ὑπερήφανοι, οἱ εἰπόντες τῷ Ἱερεμία, λέγον-
τες, ψεύδη, οὐκ ἀπέστειλέ σε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν πρὸς ἡμᾶς,
3 εἰπεῖν, μὴ εἰσέλθητε εἰς Αἴγυπτον κατοικεῖν ἐκεῖ, ἀλλ᾿ ὁ Βα-
ροὺχ υἱὸς Νηρίου συμβάλλει σε πρὸς ἡμᾶς, ἵνα δῷς ἡμᾶς εἰς
χεῖρας τῶν Χαλδαίων, τοῦ θανατῶσαι ἡμᾶς, καὶ τοῦ ἀποκισθῆναι
4 ἡμᾶς εἰς Βαβυλῶνα. Καὶ οὐκ ἤκουσεν Ἰωάναν υἱὸς Καριέ, καὶ
πάντες οἱ ἡγεμόνες τῆς δυνάμεως, καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς τῆς φωνῆς Κυ-
5 ρίου, κατοικῆσαι ἐν γῇ Ἰούδα. Καὶ ἔλαβεν Ἰωάναν υἱὸς Καριέ,
καὶ πάντες οἱ ἡγεμόνες τῆς δυνάμεως ἅπαντας τοὺς καταλοίπους
Ἰούδα, τοὺς ἀποστρέψαντας ἐκ πάντων τῶν ἐθνῶν, οὓς διεσπάρησαν

**JEREMIAH 49**

**17** ...Egypt to sojourn there, they shall be consumed by the sword, and by the famine, and by death; and not one of them shall be saved from the evils which I shall bring upon them.
**18** For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: As My wrath and My indignation have been poured out upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so shall My wrath be poured out upon you, when ye shall enter into Egypt; and ye shall become a delusion, and subject [to bondage], and a curse, and a reproach; and ye shall no more behold this place.
**19** Thus spake the Lord concerning you, the remnant of Judah, saying, "Enter ye not into Egypt." And now therefore, knowing [as ye do], ye shall surely know that I have testified unto you this day.
**20** For ye have dealt wickedly in your souls, when ye sent me unto the Lord your God, saying, "Pray concerning us unto the Lord our God, and according to all that the Lord your God shall speak unto thee, so declare it unto us, and we will do it."
**21** And I have declared it unto you this day; yet ye have not hearkened unto the voice of the Lord your God, by whom He sent me unto you.
**22** Now therefore know ye for certain, that by the sword, and by the famine, and by death shall ye perish in the place whereunto ye desire to enter and to dwell therein.

**CHAPTER 50**

**1** And it came to pass, when Jeremiah had ceased speaking unto all the people all the words of the Lord their God, which the Lord their God had sent him unto them—even all these words—
**2** that Azariah the son of Maasias, and Johanan the son of Kareh, and all the proud men who had spoken unto Jeremiah, saying, "Thou speakest falsely! The Lord our God hath not sent thee unto us
**3** to say, 'Enter ye not into Egypt to dwell there'; but Baruch the son of Neriah inciteth thee against us, that thou mightest deliver us into the hands of the Chaldeans, to cause us to die, and to carry us away captive unto Babylon."
**4** So Johanan the son of Kareh, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord, to dwell in the land of Judah.
**5** Then Johanan the son of Kareh, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, who had returned from all the nations whither they had been scattered,
