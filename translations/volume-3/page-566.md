παντοκράτορος; καὶ ἐξέλιπον λαοὶ ἱκανοὶ ἐν πυρί, καὶ ἔθνη πολ-
14 λὰ ὠλιγοψύχησαν. Ὅτι ἐμπλησθήσεται ἡ σύμπασα γῆ τοῦ γνῶ-
15 ναι τὴν δόξαν Κυρίου, ὡς ὕδωρ πολὺ κατακαλύψει αὐτούς. Ὁ
ποτίζων τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ ἀνατροπῇ θολερᾷ καὶ μεθύσκων,
16 ὅπως ἐπιβλέπῃ ἐπὶ τὰ σπήλαια αὐτῶν, πλησμονὴν ἀτιμίας ἐκ
δόξης πίε καὶ σύ, καὶ διασαλευθήτι, καὶ σείσθητι· ἐκύκλωσεν
ἐπὶ σὲ ποτήριον δεξιᾶς Κυρίου, καὶ συνήχθη ἀτιμία ἐπὶ τὴν δό-
17 ξαν σου. Διότι ἀσέβεια τοῦ Λιβάνου καλύψει σε, καὶ ταλαιπω-
ρία θηρίων πτοήσει σε, δι' αἵματα ἀνθρώπων, ἀσέβειαν γῆς καὶ
18 πόλεως, καὶ πάντων τῶν κατοικούντων αὐτήν. Τί ὠφελεῖ γλυ-
πτόν, ὅτι ἔγλυψαν αὐτό; ἔπλασεν αὐτὸ χώνευμα, φαντασίαν
ψευδῆ, ὅτι πέποιθεν ὁ πλάσας ἐπὶ τὸ πλάσμα αὐτοῦ, τοῦ ποιῆ-
19 σαι εἴδωλα κωφά· οὐαὶ ὁ λέγων τῷ ξύλῳ, ἔκνηψον, ἐξεγέρθητι·
καὶ τῷ λίθῳ, ὑψώθητι· καὶ αὐτὸ ἐστὶ φαντασία, τοῦτο δέ ἐστιν
ἔλασμα χρυσίου καὶ ἀργυρίου, καὶ πᾶν πνεῦμα οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν αὐτῷ.
20 Ὁ δὲ Κύριος ἐν ναῷ ἁγίῳ αὐτοῦ· εὐλαβείσθω ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐ-
τοῦ πᾶσα ἡ γῆ.

ΠΡΟΣΕΥΧΗ ΑΜΒΑΚΟΥΜ.

**3.1** ΚΥΡΙΕ εἰσακήκοα τὴν ἀκοήν σου, καὶ ἐφοβήθην. Κύριε κατ-
**3.2** ενόησα τὰ ἔργα σου, καὶ ἐξέστην. Ἐν μέσω δύο ζώων γνωσθή-
σῃ, ἐν τῷ ἐγγίζειν τὰ ἔτη, ἐπιγνωσθήσῃ· ἐν τῷ παρεῖναι τὸν
καιρόν, ἀναδειχθήσῃ· ἐν τῷ ταραχθῆναι τὴν ψυχήν μου, ἐν ὀργῇ
**3.3** ἐλέους μνησθήσῃ. Ὁ Θεὸς ἐκ Θαιμὰν ἥξει, καὶ ὁ ἅγιος ἐξ ὄρους
Φαρὰν κατασκίου δασέος. Διάψαλμα. Ἐκάλυψεν οὐρανοὺς ἡ ἀρε-
**3.4** τὴ αὐτοῦ, καὶ αἰνέσεως αὐτοῦ πλήρης ἡ γῆ. Καὶ φέγγος αὐτοῦ
ὡς φῶς ἔσται· κέρατα ἐν χερσὶν αὐτοῦ ὑπάρχει αὐτῷ· καὶ ἔθε-
**3.5** το ἀγάπησιν κραταιὰν ἰσχύος αὐτοῦ. Πρὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ
πορεύσεται λόγος, καὶ ἐξελεύσεται ἐν πεδίοις κατὰ πόδας αὐτοῦ.
**3.6** Ἔστη, καὶ ἐσαλεύθη ἡ γῆ· ἐπέβλεψε, καὶ ἐτάκη ἔθνη· καὶ δι-
εθρύβη τὰ ὄρη βία, ἐτάκησαν βουνοὶ αἰώνιοι, πορείας αἰωνίους
**3.7** αὐτοῦ· ἀντὶ κόπων εἶδον σκηνώματα Αἰθιόπων, πτοηθήσονται
**3.8** καὶ αἱ σκηναὶ γῆς Μαδιάμ. Διάψαλμα. Μὴ ἐν ποταμοῖς ὠργί-
σθης Κύριε; μὴ ἐν ποταμοῖς ὁ θυμός σου; ἢ ἐν θαλάσσῃ τὸ ὅρ-
μημά σου; ὅτι ἐπιβίβασῃ ἐπὶ τοὺς ἵππους σου, καὶ ἡ ἱππασία σου

**CHAPTER 2** *(Continued)*

**13** ...the Almighty? For many peoples have failed by fire, and many nations have become faint of heart.

**14** For the whole earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as many waters do cover them.

**15** He that giveth his neighbour drink with turbid overthrow, and maketh [him] drunken, that he might look upon their caves—

**16** [receive] a fullness of dishonour instead of glory. Drink thou also, and be shaken, and be tossed; the cup of the Lord's right hand hath encompassed thee, and dishonour is gathered upon thy glory.

**17** For the impiety of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the distress of beasts shall terrify thee, for the blood of men, [and for] the impiety of the land and of the city, and of all those who dwell therein.

**18** What profiteth the graven image, because they have graven it? He hath moulded it, a molten image, a false imagination, because he that moulded it hath trusted in his own moulding, to make dumb idols.

**19** Woe unto him that saith to the wood, "Awake, arise!" and to the stone, "Be lifted up!" And it is an imagination, and this is a plating of gold and silver, and there is no spirit within it.

**20** But the Lord is in His holy temple; let all the earth reverence before His face.

**THE PRAYER OF HABAKKUK**

**3.1** O Lord, I have heard Thy report, and I was afraid.

**3.2** O Lord, I have understood Thy works, and I was amazed. In the midst of two living creatures shalt Thou be known; as the years draw nigh, shalt Thou be acknowledged; as the time is at hand, shalt Thou be revealed; in the trouble of my soul, in wrath wilt Thou remember mercy.

**3.3** God shall come from Teman, and the Holy One from the shady, thick-forested Mount Pharan. Selah. His excellence hath covered the heavens,

**3.4** and the earth is full of His praise. And His light shall be as the light; horns are in His hands;

**3.5** and He hath set a mighty love of His strength. Before His face shall go forth a word, and it shall go forth in the plains according to His steps.

**3.6** He stood, and the earth was shaken; He looked, and the nations melted; and the mountains were broken by violence, the everlasting hills melted, [even] His eternal journeys.

**3.7** Instead of toil, I saw the tents of the Ethiopians,

**3.8** and the tents of the land of Midian shall be terrified. Selah. Was it against the rivers, O Lord, that Thou wast wroth? Was Thy wrath against the rivers? Or was Thy rushing against the sea? [Was it not] that Thou didst cause Thy horses to ride, and Thy chariots [are] salvation?
