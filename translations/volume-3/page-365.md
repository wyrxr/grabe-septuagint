Χειρὶ Ναβουζαρδὰν τοῦ ἀρχιμαγείρου, λέγων. Λάβε αὐτόν, καὶ 12
θὲς τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς σου ἐπ᾿ αὐτόν, καὶ μὴ ποιήσῃς αὐτῷ οὐδὲν
κακόν· ἀλλὰ καθὼς λαλήσῃ πρὸς σέ, καὶ οὕτως ποιήσεις αὐτῷ.
Καὶ ἀπέστειλε Ναβουζαρδὰν ὁ ἀρχιμάγειρος, καὶ Ναβουσεζβάν, 13
καὶ Ῥαψαρής, καὶ Νηργέλ, καὶ Σαρασάρ, καὶ Φαβμάν, καὶ πάν-
τες οἱ ἡγεμόνες βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος. Καὶ ἀπέστειλαν, καὶ ἔλα- 14
βον τὸν Ἱερεμίαν ἐξ αὐλῆς τῆς φυλακῆς, καὶ ἔδωκαν αὐτὸν
πρὸς Γοδολίαν υἱὸν Ἀχικάμ υἱοῦ Σαφάν, καὶ ἐξήγαγον αὐτὸν
εἰς Ἰαφίθ· καὶ ἐκάθισεν ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ λαοῦ. Καὶ πρὸς Ἱερεμίαν 15
ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου ὄντος αὐτοῦ συνεχομένου ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ τῆς
φυλακῆς, λέγων· πορεύου καὶ εἰπὸν πρὸς Ἀβδεμέλεχ τὸν Αἰθίο- 16
πα, λέγων· οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ· Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ φέρω
τοὺς λόγους μου ἐπὶ τὴν πόλιν ταύτην εἰς κακὰ καὶ οὐκ εἰς
ἀγαθά, καὶ ἔσονται κατὰ πρόσωπόν σου ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ· καὶ
σώσω σε ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, καὶ οὐ μὴ παραδώσω σε εἰς χεῖ- 17
ρας τῶν ἀνθρώπων, ὧν σὺ φοβῇ ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτῶν, ὅτι 18
σώζων σώσω σε, καὶ ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ οὐ μὴ πέσῃς· καὶ ἔσται ἡ ψυ-
χή σου εἰς εὕρημα, ὅτι ἐπεποίθεις ἐπ᾿ ἐμοί, φησὶ Κύριος.

ΚΕΦ. ΜΖʹ. XLVII.
(Hebr. XL.)

Ὁ λόγος ὁ γενόμενος παρὰ Κυρίου πρὸς Ἱερεμίαν ὕστερον, 1
μετὰ τὸ ἀποστεῖλαι αὐτὸν Ναβουζαρδὰν τὸν ἀρχιμάγειρον ἐκ
Ῥαμά, ἐν τῷ λαβεῖν αὐτὸν δεδεμένον ἐν χειροπέδαις, ἐν μέσῳ
ἀποικίας Ἱερουσαλὴμ καὶ Ἰούδα τῶν ἀπαγομένων εἰς Βαβυλῶ-
να. Καὶ ἔλαβεν αὐτὸν ὁ ἀρχιμάγειρος, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· Κύριος 2
ὁ Θεός σου ἐλάλησε τὰ κακὰ ταῦτα ἐπὶ τὸν τόπον τοῦτον· καὶ 3
ἐπήγαγε καὶ ἐποίησε Κύριος, ὅτι ἡμάρτετε αὐτῷ, καὶ οὐκ εἰση-
κούσατε τῆς φωνῆς αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐγένετο ὑμῖν τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο.
Καὶ νῦν ἰδοὺ ἔλυσά σε σήμερον ἀπὸ τῶν χειροπέδων τῶν ἐπὶ 4
τὰς χεῖράς σου· εἰ καλὸν ἐναντίον σου ἐλθεῖν μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ εἰς Βα-
βυλῶνα, ἧκε, καὶ θήσω τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς μου ἐπὶ σέ· καὶ εἰ πον-
ηρὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς σου ἐλθεῖν μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ εἰς Βαβυλῶνα, ἀπό-
μεινον· ἰδοὺ πᾶσα ἡ γῆ ἐναντίον σου· ὅπου ἂν εἰς ἀγαθὸν καὶ
εἰς τὸ εὐθὲς ἐκπορευθῆναι, πορεύου· εἰ δὲ μή, ἀπόστρεψον καὶ 5

**JEREMIAH 46 (Septuagint) / JEREMIAH 39 (Hebrew)**

**11** by the hand of Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, saying:
**12** “Take him, and set thine eyes upon him, and do him no harm; but as he shall speak unto thee, so shalt thou do unto him.”
**13** And Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, sent forth, and Nabusezban, and Rapsaris, and Nergel, and Sarasar, and Phabman, and all the princes of the king of Babylon.
**14** And they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and delivered him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan; and they brought him forth to Iaphith, and he dwelt among the people.
**15** Now the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah, while he was yet confined in the court of the prison, saying:
**16** “Go, and speak unto Abdemelech the Ethiopian, saying: Thus saith the Lord God of Israel: Behold, I bring My words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be before thy face in that day.
**17** But I will deliver thee in that day, and I will not deliver thee into the hands of the men of whom thou art afraid.
**18** For I will surely save thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword; and thy soul shall be for a spoil, because thou hast trusted in Me, saith the Lord.”

**JEREMIAH 47 (Septuagint) / JEREMIAH 40 (Hebrew)**

**1** The word which came unto Jeremiah from the Lord, after Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, had sent him from Ramah, when he had taken him, being bound in fetters, among all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah who were being carried away unto Babylon.
**2** And the captain of the guard took him, and said unto him: “The Lord thy God hath spoken these evils upon this place,
**3** and the Lord hath brought [it to pass] and performed [it], because ye have sinned against Him, and have not hearkened unto His voice; and this thing is come upon you.
**4** And now, behold, I have loosed thee this day from the chains which are upon thine hands. If it seem good unto thee to come with me unto Babylon, come, and I will set mine eyes upon thee [for thy protection]; but if it be evil in thine eyes to come with me unto Babylon, remain thou [here]; behold, all the land is before thee; whithersoever it seemeth good and right unto thee to go, go thou.
**5** But if not, turn thou back, and
