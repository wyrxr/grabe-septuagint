ΚΕΦ. ΙΔʹ.
ΙΕΡΕΜΙΑΣ 1237
καὶ αἱ πύλαι αὐτῆς ἐκενώθησαν, καὶ ἐσκοτώθησαν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς,
καὶ ἡ κραυγὴ τῆς Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἀνέβη, καὶ οἱ μεγιστᾶνες αὐτῆς 3
ἀπέστειλαν τοὺς νεωτέρους αὐτῶν ἐφ᾽ ὕδωρ· ἤλθοσαν ἐπὶ
τὰ φρέατα, καὶ οὐχ εὗρον ὕδωρ· ἀπέστρεψαν τὰ ἀγγεῖα
αὐτῶν κενά· ἠσχύνθησαν καὶ ἐπεκάλυψαν τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτῶν.
Καὶ τὰ ἔργα τῆς γῆς ἐξέλιπεν, ὅτι οὐκ ἦν ὑετὸς ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, 4
ἠσχύνθησαν γεωργοί, ἐπεκάλυψαν τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἔλα- 5
φοι ἐν ἀγρῷ ἐτέκοσαν, καὶ ἐγκατέλιπον, ὅτι οὐκ ἦν βοτάνη.
Ὄνοι ἄγριοι ἔστησαν ἐπὶ νάπας, καὶ εἵλκυσαν ἄνεμον ὡς δρά- 6
κων, ἐξέλιπον οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτῶν, ὅτι οὐκ ἦν χόρτος ἀπὸ λαοῦ
ἀδικίας. Εἰ αἱ ἁμαρτίαι ἡμῶν ἀντέστησαν ἡμῖν, Κύριε, ποίησον 7
ἡμῖν ἕνεκεν τοῦ ὀνόματός σου, ὅτι πολλαὶ αἱ ἁμαρτίαι ἡμῶν ἐ-
ναντίον σου, ὅτι σοὶ ἡμάρτομεν. Ὑπομονὴ Ἰσραήλ, Κύριε, καὶ 8
σώζεις ἐν καιρῷ κακῶν· ἵνατί ἐγενήθης ὡσεὶ πάροικος ἐπὶ τῆς
γῆς, καὶ ὡς αὐτόχθων ἐκκλίνων εἰς κατάλυμα ; Μὴ ἔσῃ ὥσπερ 9
ἄνθρωπος ὑπνῶν, ἢ ὡς ἀνὴρ οὐ δυνάμενος σῴζειν ; καὶ σὺ ἐν ἡ-
μῖν εἶ Κύριε, καὶ τὸ ὄνομά σου ἐπικέκληται ἐφ᾽ ἡμᾶς, μὴ ἐπι-
λάθῃ ἡμῶν. Οὕτως λέγει Κύριος τῷ λαῷ τούτῳ· ἠγάπησαν 10
κινεῖν πόδας αὐτῶν, καὶ οὐκ ἐφείσαντο, καὶ ὁ Θεὸς οὐκ ηὐδόκη-
σεν ἐν αὐτοῖς, νῦν μνησθήσεται τῆς ἀδικίας αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπισκέψε-
ται τὰς ἀνομίας αὐτῶν. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς μέ· μὴ προσεύχου 11
περὶ τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου εἰς ἀγαθά· ὅτι ἐὰν νηστεύσωσιν, οὐκ εἰσα- 12
κούσομαι τῆς δεήσεως αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐὰν προσενέγκωσιν ὁλοκαυτώ-
ματα καὶ θυσίας, οὐκ εὐδοκήσω ἐν αὐτοῖς, ὅτι ἐν μαχαίρᾳ καὶ
ἐν λιμῷ καὶ ἐν θανάτῳ ἐγὼ συντελέσω αὐτούς. Καὶ εἶπα· ὦ ὢν, 13
δέσποτα Κύριε, ἰδοὺ οἱ προφῆται αὐτῶν προφητεύουσι, καὶ λέ-
γουσιν, οὐκ ἕξεσθε μάχαιραν, οὐδὲ λιμὸς ἔσται ἐν ὑμῖν, ὅτι
ἀλήθειαν καὶ εἰρήνην δώσω ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἐν τῷ τόπῳ τούτῳ.
Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς μέ· ψευδῆ οἱ προφῆται προφητεύουσιν 14
ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί μου, οὐκ ἀπέστειλα αὐτούς, καὶ οὐκ ἐνετειλάμην
αὐτοῖς, καὶ οὐκ ἐλάλησα πρὸς αὐτούς· ὅτι ὁράσεις ψευδεῖς, καὶ
μαντείας καὶ οἰωνίσματα, καὶ προαιρέσεις καρδίας αὐτῶν αὐτοὶ
προφητεύουσιν ὑμῖν. Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Κύριος περὶ τῶν προ- 15
φητῶν τῶν προφητευόντων ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί μου ψευδῆ, κἀγὼ
οὐκ ἀπέστειλα αὐτούς, οἱ λέγουσι, μάχαιρα καὶ λιμὸς οὐκ ἔσται
ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς ταύτης, ἐν θανάτῳ νοσερῷ ἀποθανοῦνται· ἐν ῥεμ-

### JEREMIAH 14

**2** ...and her gates are desolate, and they are darkened upon the earth; and the cry of Jerusalem ascended.
**3** And her nobles sent their young men for water; they came unto the wells, and found no water; they returned their vessels empty; they were ashamed and covered their heads.
**4** And the labor of the earth failed, because there was no rain upon the earth; the farmers were ashamed, they covered their heads.
**5** Moreover, the hinds in the field calved, and then forsook [their young], because there was no herbage.
**6** Wild asses stood upon the glens, and drew in the wind as a dragon; their eyes failed, because there was no grass by reason of the people's iniquity.
**7** Though our iniquities testify against us, O Lord, act Thou for us for Thy name's sake; for our backslidings are many before Thee, and against Thee have we sinned.
**8** O Lord, the Hope of Israel, and His Savior in time of trouble, why art Thou become as a stranger in the land, and as one belonging to the land who turneth aside into a lodging place?
**9** Be Thou not as a man that slumbereth, or as a mighty man that cannot save? Yet Thou, O Lord, art in the midst of us, and Thy name is called upon us; forsake us not.
**10** Thus saith the Lord unto this people: They have loved to wander with their feet, and have not refrained [themselves]; therefore the Lord delighteth not in them; He shall now remember their iniquity, and visit their sins.
**11** Then said the Lord unto me: Pray thou not for this people for their good.
**12** For when they fast, I will not hear their supplication; and when they offer burnt offerings and oblations, I will not accept them; but by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence will I consume them.
**13** Then said I, "Ah, Sovereign Lord! behold, the prophets say unto them, 'Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; for I will give you assured peace in this place.'"
**14** Then the Lord said unto me: The prophets prophesy lies in My name; I have not sent them, neither have I commanded them, neither have I spoken unto them; for false visions, and divinations, and vain things, and the deceit of their own heart, they themselves prophesy unto you.
**15** Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets that prophesy in My name, whom I have not sent, and who say, 'Sword and famine shall not be in this land': by grievous pestilence shall they die; by the sword...
