16    φαίᾳ καὶ ἐν λιμῷ συντελεσθήσονται οἱ προφῆται ἐκεῖνοι, καὶ ὁ
      λαός, οἷς αὐτοὶ προφητεύουσιν αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἔσονται ἐῤῥιμμένοι ἐν
      ταῖς διόδοις Ἱερουσαλήμ, ἀπὸ προσώπου μαχαίρας καὶ τοῦ λι-
      μοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ὁ θάπτων αὐτούς, καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες αὐτῶν, καὶ
      οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτῶν, καὶ αἱ θυγατέρες αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐκχεῶ ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς
17    τὰ κακὰ αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτοὺς τὸν λόγον τοῦτον· κατα-
      γάγετε ἐπ᾿ ὀφθαλμοὺς ὑμῶν δάκρυα ἡμέρας καὶ νυκτός, καὶ μὴ
      διαλιπέτωσαν, ὅτι συντρίμματι συνετρίβη ἡ θυγάτηρ λαοῦ μου,
18    καὶ πληγὴ ὀδυνηρὰ σφόδρα. Ἐὰν ἐξέλθω εἰς τὸ πεδίον, καὶ ἰδοὺ
      τραυματίαι ῥομφαίας, καὶ ἐὰν εἰσέλθω εἰς τὴν πόλιν, καὶ ἰδοὺ
      πόνος λιμοῦ, ὅτι ἱερεὺς καὶ προφήτης ἐπορεύθησαν εἰς γῆν, ἣν
19    οὐκ ᾔδεισαν. Μὴ ἀποδοκιμάζων ἀπεδοκίμασας τὸν Ἰούδαν, καὶ
      ἀπὸ Σιὼν ἀπέστη ἡ ψυχή σου ; ἵνατί ἔπτασας ἡμᾶς, καὶ οὐκ
      ἔστιν ἡμῖν ἴασις ; ὑπεμείναμεν εἰς εἰρήνην, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἀγαθὰ
20    εἰς καιρὸν ἰάσεως, καὶ ἰδοὺ ταραχή. Ἔγνωμεν, Κύριε, ἁμαρ-
      τήματα ἡμῶν, ἀδικίας πατέρων ἡμῶν, ὅτι ἡμάρτομεν ἐναντίον
21    σου. Κόπασον διὰ τὸ ὄνομά σου, μὴ ἀπολέσῃς θρόνον δόξης
22    σου· μνήσθητι, μὴ διασκεδάσῃς τὴν διαθήκην σου μεθ᾿ ἡμῶν. Μὴ
      ἔστιν ἐν εἰδώλοις τῶν ἐθνῶν ὑετίζων ; καὶ εἰ ὁ οὐρανὸς δώσει
      πλησμονὴν αὐτοῦ, οὐχὶ σὺ εἶ αὐτός ; καὶ ὑπομενοῦμέν σε, ὅτι
      σὺ ἐποίησας πάντα ταῦτα.

                     ΚΕΦ. ΙΕʹ. ΧV.

1     ΚΑΙ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς μέ· ἐὰν στῇ Μωσῆς καὶ Σαμουὴλ
      πρὸ προσώπου μου, οὐκ ἔστιν ἡ ψυχή μου πρὸς αὐτούς· ἐξαπό-
2     στειλον τὸν λαὸν τοῦτον, καὶ ἐξελθάτωσαν. Καὶ ἔσται ἐὰν εἴ-
      πωσι πρὸς σέ, ποῦ ἐξελευσόμεθα ; καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτούς· τάδε
      λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεός· ὅσοι εἰς θάνατον, εἰς θάνατον· καὶ ὅσοι
      εἰς μάχαιραν, εἰς μάχαιραν· καὶ ὅσοι εἰς λιμόν, εἰς λιμόν· καὶ
3     ὅσοι εἰς αἰχμαλωσίαν, εἰς αἰχμαλωσίαν. Καὶ ἐκδικήσω ἐπ᾿ αὐ-
      τοὺς τέσσαρα εἴδη, λέγει Κύριος· τὴν μάχαιραν εἰς σφαγήν, καὶ
      τοὺς κύνας εἰς διασπασμόν, καὶ τὰ θηρία τῆς γῆς καὶ τὰ πε-
4     τεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ εἰς βρῶσιν καὶ εἰς διαφθοράν. Καὶ παρα-
      δώσω αὐτοὺς εἰς ἀνάγκας πάσαις ταῖς βασιλείαις τῆς γῆς, διὰ
      Μανασσῆ υἱὸν Ἑζεκία βασιλέα Ἰούδα, περὶ πάντων ὧν ἐποίη-

### JEREMIAH 14

**16** By a dusky [stroke] and by famine shall those prophets be consumed, and the people to whom they themselves prophesy unto them; and they shall be cast out into the streets of Jerusalem, from the face of the sword and of the famine, and there shall be none to bury them, nor their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters; and I will pour out upon them their evils.
**17** And thou shalt speak unto them this word: Let your eyes bring forth tears day and night, and let them not cease, for the daughter of My people is broken with a great breaking, and her wound is exceedingly grievous.
**18** If I go forth into the field, behold, there are those wounded by the sword; and if I enter into the city, behold, there is the anguish of famine; for priest and prophet have gone into a land which they knew not.
**19** Hast Thou utterly rejected Judah, and is Thy soul turned away from Zion? Wherefore hast Thou caused us to stumble, and there is no healing for us? We looked for peace, and no good came; for a time of healing, and behold, there is trouble.
**20** We have acknowledged, O Lord, our sins, and the iniquities of our fathers, for we have sinned before Thee.
**21** Cease, for Thy name’s sake; destroy not the throne of Thy glory. Remember, break not Thy covenant with us.
**22** Is there among the idols of the nations one that causeth rain? And if the heaven shall give its fullness, art Thou not He? Therefore we will wait for Thee, for Thou hast made all these things.

### JEREMIAH 15

**1** Then said the Lord unto me: Though Moses and Samuel should stand before My face, yet My soul is not inclined unto them. Send out this people, and let them go forth.
**2** And it shall be, if they say unto thee, "Whither shall we go forth?" then shalt thou say unto them, "Thus saith the Lord God: Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and such as are for captivity, to captivity."
**3** And I will appoint against them four kinds [of judgment], saith the Lord: the sword for slaughter, and the dogs for tearing apart, and the beasts of the earth and the birds of the air for food and for destruction.
**4** And I will deliver them up for tribulation to all the kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, for all the things which he did...
