ἑβδόμῳ· μιᾷ τοῦ μηνὸς λήψῃ παρ᾿ ἑκάστου ἀγνοοῦντος, καὶ ἀπὸ
νηπίου· καὶ ἐξιλάσεσθε τὸν οἶκον.
²¹ Καὶ ἐν τῷ πρώτῳ μηνὶ, τεσσαρεσκαιδεκάτῃ τοῦ μηνός, ἔσται ὑμῖν τὸ πάσχα ἑορτή· ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας ἄζυμα ἔδεσθε.
²² Καὶ ποιήσει ὁ ἀφηγούμενος ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ὑπὲρ αὐτοῦ καὶ ὑπὲρ τοῦ οἴκου, καὶ ὑπὲρ παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ τῆς γῆς, μόσχον ὑπὲρ ἁμαρτίας.
²³ Καὶ τὰς ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας τῆς ἑορτῆς ποιήσει ὁλοκαυτώματα τῷ Κυρίῳ ἑπτὰ μόσχους καὶ ἑπτὰ κριοὺς ἀμώμους καθ᾿ ἡμέραν, τὰς ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας, καὶ ὑπὲρ ἁμαρτίας ἔριφον αἰγῶν καθ᾿ ἡμέραν, καὶ θυσίαν.
²⁴ Καὶ πέμμα τῷ μόσχῳ, καὶ πέμμα τῷ κριῷ ποιήσεις, καὶ ἐλαίου τὸ εἶν τῷ πέμματι.
²⁵ Καὶ ἐν τῷ ἑβδόμῳ μηνὶ πεντεκαιδεκάτῃ ἡμέρᾳ τοῦ μηνὸς, ἐν τῇ ἑορτῇ, ποιήσεις κατὰ τὰ αὐτά, ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας, καθὼς τὰ ὑπὲρ τῆς ἁμαρτίας, καὶ καθὼς τὰ ὁλοκαυτώματα, καὶ καθὼς τὸ Μαναὰ, καὶ καθὼς τὸ ἔλαιον.

ΚΕΦ. ΜΣ΄. XLVI.

¹ ΤΑΔΕ λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεός· πύλη ἡ ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ τῇ ἐσωτέρᾳ, ἡ βλέπουσα πρὸς ἀνατολάς, ἔσται κεκλεισμένη ἓξ ἡμέρας τὰς ἐνεργούς· ἐν δὲ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῶν σαββάτων ἀνοιχθήσεται· καὶ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῆς νουμηνίας ἀνοιχθήσεται, καὶ εἰσελεύσεται ὁ ἀφηγούμενος
² κατὰ τὴν ὁδὸν τοῦ Αἰλὰμ τῆς πύλης τῆς ἔξωθεν, καὶ στήσεται ἐπὶ τὰ πρόθυρα τῆς πύλης, καὶ ποιήσουσιν οἱ ἱερεῖς τὰ ὁλοκαυτώματα αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰ τοῦ σωτηρίου αὐτοῦ. Καὶ προσκυνήσει ἐπὶ τοῦ
³ προθύρου τῆς πύλης, καὶ ἐξελεύσεται, καὶ ἡ πύλη οὐ μὴ κλεισθῇ ἕως ἑσπέρας· καὶ προσκυνήσει ὁ λαὸς τῆς γῆς κατὰ τὰ πρόθυρα τῆς πύλης ἐκείνης, καὶ ἐν τοῖς σαββάτοις καὶ ἐν ταῖς νουμηνίαις, ἐναντίον τοῦ Κυρίου.
⁴ Καὶ τὸ ὁλοκαύτωμα προσσοίσει ὁ ἀφηγούμενος τῷ Κυρίῳ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῶν σαββάτων, ἓξ ἀμνοὺς ἀμώμους, καὶ κριὸν ἄμωμον, καὶ Μαναὰ πέμμα τῷ κριῷ, καὶ τοῖς
⁵ ἀμνοῖς θυσίαν, δόμα τῆς χειρὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐλαίου τὸ εἶν τῷ πέμματι.
⁶ Καὶ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῆς νουμηνίας μόσχον υἱὸν βουκολίου ἄμωμον, καὶ ἓξ ἀμνοὺς, καὶ κριὸς ἄμωμος ἔσται, καὶ πέμμα τῷ
⁷ κριῷ, καὶ πέμμα τῷ μόσχῳ ἔσται Μαναὰ, καὶ τοῖς ἀμνοῖς, καθὼς ἂν ἐκποιῆ ἡ χεὶρ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐλαίου τὸ εἶν τῷ πέμματι.
⁸ Καὶ ἐν τῷ εἰσπορεύεσθαι τὸν ἀφηγοῦμενον, κατὰ τὴν ὁδὸν τοῦ Αἰλὰμ

¹⁶ ...the seventh [month]; on the first day of the month, thou shalt take from every unwitting one, and from a child; and ye shall make atonement for the house.
²¹ And in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, shall be unto you the Passover, a feast; seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread.
²² And the ruler shall prepare in that day a calf for a sin offering for himself, and for his house, and for all the people of the land.
²³ And for the seven days of the feast, he shall prepare burnt offerings unto the Lord: seven calves and seven rams without blemish daily, [for] the seven days; and for a sin offering, a kid of the goats daily, and a grain offering.
²⁴ And a grain offering for the calf, and a grain offering for the ram shalt thou make, and a hin of oil with the grain offering.
²⁵ And in the seventh month, on the fifteenth day of the month, in the feast, thou shalt prepare in like manner for seven days, as concerning the sin offering, and as concerning the burnt offerings, and as concerning the Man'a [offering], and as concerning the oil.

**Chapter 46**

¹ THUS saith the Lord God: The gate of the inner court that looketh toward the east shall be shut six working days; but on the Sabbath day it shall be opened, and on the day of the new moon it shall be opened.
² And the ruler shall enter by the way of the Ailam of the outer gate, and shall stand by the doorposts of the gate; and the priests shall prepare his burnt offerings and his peace offerings. And he shall worship at the
³ doorpost of the gate, and he shall go forth; and the gate shall not be shut until the evening. And the people of the land shall worship at the doorposts of that gate, both on the Sabbaths and on the new moons, before the Lord.
⁴ And the burnt offering that the ruler shall bring near unto the Lord on the Sabbath day shall be: six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish.
⁵ And a Man'a grain offering for the ram, and for the lambs a grain offering, a gift of his hand; and a hin of oil with the grain offering.
⁶ And on the day of the new moon: a calf, a son of the herd, without blemish; and six lambs, and a ram without blemish shall there be.
⁷ And a grain offering for the ram, and a grain offering for the calf shall be a Man'a [offering]; and for the lambs, as his hand shall be able to provide; and a hin of oil with the grain offering.
⁸ And when the ruler shall enter, he shall enter by the way of the Ailam of the gate.
