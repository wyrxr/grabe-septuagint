ΚΕΦ. ΙΔʹ. ΧΙV

1 ΚΑὶ ἐλεήσει Κύριος τὸν Ἰακώβ, καὶ ἐκλέξεται ἔτι τὸν Ἰσραήλ,
καὶ ἀναπαύσονται ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς αὐτῶν, καὶ ὁ γεώρας προστε-
θήσεται πρὸς αὐτούς, καὶ προστεθήσεται ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον Ἰακώβ.
2 καὶ λήψονται αὐτοὺς ἔθνη, καὶ εἰσάξουσιν εἰς τὸν τόπον αὐτῶν,
καὶ κατακληρονομήσουσιν αὐτοὺς οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ πληθυνθήσον-
ται ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς τοῦ Θεοῦ εἰς δούλους καὶ δούλας· καὶ ἔσονται αἰχ-
μάλωτοι οἱ αἰχμαλωτεύσαντες αὐτοὺς, καὶ κυριευθήσονται οἱ
3 κυριεύσαντες αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, ἀναπαύσει σε
Κύριος ἀπὸ τῆς ὀδύνης καὶ τοῦ θυμοῦ σου καὶ τῆς δουλείας τῆς
4 σκληρᾶς, ἧς ἐδούλευσας αὐτοῖς. Καὶ λήφῃ τὸν θρῆνον τοῦτον ἐπὶ
τὸν βασιλέα Βαβυλῶνος, καὶ ἐρεῖς ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ· πῶς ἀνα-
5 πέπαυται ὁ ἀπαιτῶν, καὶ ἀναπέπαυται ὁ ἐπισπουδαστής; Συνέ-
τριψε Κύριος τὸν ζυγὸν τῶν ἁμαρτωλῶν, τὸν ζυγὸν τῶν ἀρχόντων.
6 Πατάξας ἔθνος θυμῷ, πληγῇ ἀνιάτῳ, παίων ἔθνος πληγὴν θυμοῦ,
7 ὃ οὐκ ἐφείσατο, ἀνεπαύσατο πεποιθώς. Πᾶσα ἡ γῆ βοᾷ μετ’ εὐ-
8 φροσύνης, καὶ τὰ ξύλα τοῦ Λιβάνου ηὐφράνθησαν ἐπὶ σοὶ, καὶ ἡ
κέδρος τοῦ Λιβάνου· ἀφ’ οὗ σὺ κεκοίμησαι, οὐκ ἀνέβη ὁ κόπτων ἡμᾶς.
9 Ὁ Ἅδης κάτωθεν ἐπικράνθη συναντήσας σοι, ἐρχομένου σου· συνη-
γέρθησάν σοι πάντες οἱ γίγαντες οἱ ἄρξαντες τῆς γῆς, οἱ ἐγείραν-
10 τες ἐκ τῶν θρόνων αὐτῶν πάντας βασιλεῖς ἐθνῶν. Πάντες ἀπο-
κριθήσονται, καὶ ἐροῦσί σοι· καὶ σὺ ἐάλως, ὥσπερ καὶ ἡμεῖς· ἐν
11 ἡμῖν δὲ κατελογίσθης. Κατέβη δὲ εἰς ᾅδου ἡ δόξα σου, ἡ πολλὴ εὐ-
φροσύνη σου· ὑποκάτω σου στρώσουσι σῆψιν, καὶ τὸ κατακάλυμ-
12 μά σου σκώληξ. Πῶς ἐξέπεσεν ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ὁ ἑωσφόρος ὁ πρωΐ
ἀνατέλλων; συνετρίβη εἰς τὴν γῆν ὁ ἀποστέλλων πρὸς πάντα τὰ
13 ἔθνη. Σὺ δὲ εἶπας ἐν τῇ διανοίᾳ σου· εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν ἀναβή-
14 σομαι, ἐπάνω τῶν ἄστρων τοῦ οὐρανοῦ θήσω τὸν θρόνον μου,
καθιῶ ἐν ὄρει ὑψηλῷ, ἐπὶ τὰ ὄρη τὰ ὑψηλὰ τὰ πρὸς βορρᾶν, ἀ-
15 ναβήσομαι ἐπάνω τῶν νεφελῶν, ἔσομαι ὅμοιος τῷ ὑψίστῳ. Νῦν
16 δὲ εἰς ᾅδου καταβήσῃ, καὶ εἰς τὰ θεμέλια τῆς γῆς. Οἱ ἰδόντες
σε, θαυμάσουσιν ἐπὶ σοὶ, καὶ ἐροῦσι περὶ σοῦ· οὗτος ὁ ἄνθρωπος
17 ὁ παροξύνων τὴν γῆν, σείων βασιλείας, ὁ θείσας τὴν οἰκουμένην ὅλην
ἔρημον, καὶ τὰς πόλεις αὐτοῦ καθεῖλε, τοὺς ἐν ἐπαγωγῇ αὐτοῦ οὐκ

### Chapter 14

**1** For the Lord will have mercy upon Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, and they shall find rest in their own land; and the sojourner shall be added unto them, and shall be added to the house of Jacob.
**2** And nations shall take them, and lead them unto their [own] place; and the sons of Israel shall inherit them, and they [Israel] shall multiply upon the land of God, making [of these nations] bondmen and bondwomen. And those who led them captive shall themselves be taken captive, and those who ruled over them shall be ruled over.
**3** And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall give thee rest from thy pain and from thy vexation, and from the hard bondage, which thou didst serve unto them.
**4** And thou shalt take up this lamentation against the king of Babylon, and thou shalt say in that day: How hath he ceased, the exactor, and ceased, the oppressor?
**5** The Lord hath broken the yoke of the sinners, the yoke of the rulers.
**6** He that smote nations in fury, with a stroke incurable; he that struck a nation with a stroke of fury, [even he] who spared none, now rests in [false] confidence.
**7** All the earth shouteth for joy,
**8** yea, the trees of Lebanon have rejoiced over thee, even the cedar of Lebanon; since thou art fallen asleep, he that heweth us down is no more ascended.
**9** Hades from beneath was made bitter to meet thee at thy coming; all the giants who ruled the earth were roused to meet thee, even they who had caused all the kings of the nations to rise from their thrones.
**10** All shall answer, and say unto thee: Thou also art taken captive, even as we; thou art accounted among us.
**11** Thy glory is brought down to Hades, and thy much joy; beneath thee shall corruption be spread, and the worm shall be thy covering.
**12** How art thou fallen from heaven, O Day-star, that didst rise in the morning? He that did send forth unto all the nations is crushed to the earth.
**13** But thou saidst in thy mind: I will ascend into heaven, I will set my throne above the stars of heaven, I will sit upon a high mountain, upon the high mountains that are toward the north;
**14** I will ascend above the clouds, I will be like the Most High.
**15** But now shalt thou go down to Hades, and to the foundations of the earth.
**16** They that see thee shall wonder at thee, and shall say concerning thee: Is this the man that provoked the earth, that shook kingdoms,
**17** he that made the whole inhabited earth desolate, and laid waste its cities, [and] did not release to their homes those whom he led away captive?
