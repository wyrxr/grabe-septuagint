ἔσται πᾶσα ψυχὴ τῶν ζώων τῶν ἐκζεόντων, ἐπὶ πάντα ἐφ᾿ ἃ
ἂν ἐπέλθῃ ἐκεῖ ὁ ποταμός, ζήσεται· καὶ ἔσται ἐκεῖ ἰχθὺς πο-
λὺς σφόδρα, ὅτι ἥκει ἐκεῖ τὸ ὕδωρ τοῦτο, καὶ ὑγιάσει καὶ ζή-
10 σεται πᾶν ἐφ᾿ ὃ ἂν ἐπέλθῃ ὁ ποταμός, ἐκεῖ ζήσεται. Καὶ στή-
σονται ἐκεῖ ἁλιεῖς ἀπὸ Ἐγγαδδεὶν ἕως Ἐναγαλεὶμ· ψυγμὸς σα-
γηνῶν ἔσται, καθ᾿ αὑτὴν ἔσται· καὶ ὡς οἱ ἰχθύες τῆς θαλάσσης
11 τῆς μεγάλης, οἱ ἰχθύες αὐτῆς, πλῆθος πολὺ σφόδρα. Καὶ ἐν τῇ
διεκβολῇ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐν τῇ ἐπιστροφῇ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐν τῇ ὑπεράρσει
12 αὐτοῦ, οὐ μὴ ὑγιάσωσιν· εἰς ἅλας δέδονται, καὶ ἐπὶ τοῦ ποτα-
μοῦ ἀναβήσει, ἐπὶ τοῦ χείλους αὐτοῦ ἔνθεν καὶ ἔνθεν· πᾶν ξύλον
βρώσιμον οὐ μὴ παλαιωθῇ ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῦ, οὐδὲ μὴ ἐκλείπῃ· ὁ καρ-
πὸς αὐτοῦ τῆς καινότητος αὐτοῦ πρωτοβολήσει, διότι τὰ ὕδατα
αὐτῶν ἐκ τῶν ἁγίων ταῦτα ἐκπορεύεται, καὶ ἔσται ὁ καρπὸς αὐ-
13 τῶν εἰς βρῶσιν, καὶ ἡ ἀνάβασις αὐτῶν εἰς ὑγείαν. Τάδε λέγει
Κύριος ὁ Θεός· ταῦτα τὰ ὅρια κατακληρονομήσετε τῆς γῆς, ταῖς
14 δώδεκα φυλαῖς τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ πρόσθεσις σχοινίσματος. Καὶ
κατακληρονομήσετε αὐτὴν ἕκαστος καθὼς ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ, εἰς
ἣν ᾖρα τὴν χεῖρά μου, τοῦ δοῦναι αὐτὴν τοῖς πατράσιν αὐτῶν,
15 καὶ πεσεῖται ἡ γῆ αὕτη ὑμῖν ἐν κληρονομίᾳ. Καὶ ταῦτα τὰ ὅρια
τῆς γῆς πρὸς βορρᾶν ἀπὸ τῆς θαλάσσης τῆς μεγάλης τῆς κα-
16 ταβαινούσης, καὶ περισχιζούσης τῆς εἰσόδου Ἡμασελδὰμ, Μα-
αθθρὰς, Ἑβραμηλιὰμ, ἀναμέσον τῶν ὁρίων Ἡμὰθ, καὶ ἀνα-
μέσον τῶν ὁρίων Δαμασκοῦ, Εὐνὰν καὶ τοῦ Εὐνὰν, αἵ εἰσιν ἐπά-
17 νω τῶν ὁρίων Αὐρανίτιδος. Ταῦτα τὰ ὅρια ἀπὸ τῆς θαλάσσης
ἀπὸ τῆς αὐλῆς τοῦ Αἰνὰν, ὅρια Δαμασκοῦ, καὶ τὰ πρὸς βορρᾶν
18 κατὰ βορρᾶν, καὶ τὸ ὅριον Αἰμὰθ τὸ ὅριον βορρᾶ. Καὶ τὰ πρὸς
ἀνατολὰς ἀναμέσον τῆς Ὠρανίτιδος, καὶ ἀναμέσον Δαμασκοῦ, καὶ
ἀναμέσον τῆς Γαλααδίτιδος, καὶ ἀναμέσον τῆς γῆς τοῦ Ἰσ-
ραὴλ, ὁ Ἰορδάνης διορίζει ἐπὶ τὴν θάλασσαν, τὴν πρὸς ἀνατο-
19 λὰς φοινικῶνος· ταῦτα τὰ πρὸς ἀνατολὰς, καὶ τὰ πρὸς νότον καὶ
λίβα ἀπὸ Θαιμὰν καὶ φοινικῶνος, ἕως ὕδατος μαριμὼθ Καδὴς,
20 παρεκτεῖνον ἐπὶ τὴν θάλασσαν τὴν μεγάλην. Τοῦτο τὸ μέρος
νότος καὶ λίψ. τοῦτο τὸ μέρος τῆς θαλάσσης τῆς μεγάλης διο-
ρίζει, ἕως κατέναντι τῆς εἰσόδου Ἡμὰθ, ἕως εἰσόδου αὐτοῦ,
21 ταῦτά ἐστι τὰ πρὸς θάλασσαν Ἡμάθ. Καὶ διαμερίσετε τὴν γῆν
22 ταύτην αὐτοῖς, καὶ ταῖς φυλαῖς τοῦ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἔσται βαλεῖτε

**Chapter 47**

⁹ There shall be every living creature that teemeth forth; upon whatsoever the river shall come thither, it shall live. And there shall be there exceeding many fish, because this water cometh thither, and it shall heal; and everything upon whatsoever the river shall come, there shall it live.
¹⁰ And there shall stand there fishermen from Engeddi even unto En-Eglaim; a drying of nets shall be there, [each stretch] by itself shall it be.
¹¹ And as the fish of the Great Sea, the fish thereof shall be a multitude exceeding great. But in its outlet, and in its backwaters, and in its overflows,
¹² they shall not be healed; they are given for salt. And upon the river shall there grow, upon its bank, on this side and on that side, every tree for food; it shall not wither upon it, neither shall its fruit fail; its fruit, in its newness, shall ever bring forth its first-fruits, because these waters of them issue forth from the holy [place]. And their fruit shall be for food, and their growth for healing.

¹³ Thus saith the Lord God: These are the boundaries by which ye shall inherit the land, a portion by measuring line for the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel.
¹⁴ And ye shall inherit it, each one as his brother, [even the land] concerning which I lifted up My hand to give it unto their fathers; and this land shall fall to you for an inheritance.
¹⁵ And these are the boundaries of the land toward the north: from the Great Sea, that descendeth and separateth the entrance of Hameseldam,
¹⁶ Ma'athras, Hebramiliam, between the borders of Hamath, and between the borders of Damascus, Eunon and Eunon, which are
¹⁷ above the borders of Auranitis. These are the boundaries from the sea, from the court of Ainon, [even] the borders of Damascus, and those toward the north,
¹⁸ northward, and the border of Hamath, the border northward. And those toward the east, between Auranitis, and between Damascus, and between Galaaditis, and between the land of Israel, the Jordan divideth [it] unto the sea, [even] that
¹⁹ toward the east of the palm grove. These are those toward the east. And those toward the south and southwest: from Teman and a palm grove, even unto the water of Merimoth Cades,
²⁰ extending unto the Great Sea. This portion is the south and southwest. This portion divideth the Great Sea, even opposite the entrance of Hamath, even unto its [very] entrance.
²¹ These are those toward the sea of Hamath. And ye shall divide this land among them,
²² even among the tribes of Israel. And it shall be, ye shall cast [lots for] it [to yourselves] for you and for the sojourners who dwell among you, who have begotten sons among you; and they shall be unto you as native-born among the sons of Israel; with you they shall eat in inheritance among the tribes of Israel. And they shall be counted in a tribe of sojourners, among the sojourners with them; there shall ye give them an inheritance," saith the Lord God.
