18 ἠτοίμασα τῷ Χριστῷ μου λύχνον· τοὺς ἐχθροὺς αὐτοῦ ἐνδύσω αἰ-
   σχύνην, ἐπὶ δὲ αὐτὸν ἐξανθήσει τὸ ἁγίασμά μου.

                                ΨΑΛΜ. ΡΛΒ΄. CXXXII.

1 ᾨΔΗ τῶν ἀναβαθμῶν. Τῷ Δαυίδ. Ἰδοὺ δὴ τί καλόν, ἢ τί τερ-
2 πνόν, ἀλλ’ ἢ τὸ κατοικεῖν ἀδελφοὺς ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό; Ὡς μῦρον ἐπὶ
   κεφαλήν, τὸ καταβαῖνον ἐπὶ πώγωνα, τὸν πώγωνα τὸν Ἀαρών, τὸ
3 καταβαῖνον ἐπὶ τὴν ᾠάν τοῦ ἐνδύματος αὐτοῦ· ὡς δρόσος Ἑρμὼν
   ἡ καταβαίνουσα ἐπὶ τὰ ὄρη Σιών. Ὅτι ἐκεῖ ἐνετείλατο Κύριος
   τὴν εὐλογίαν αὐτοῦ καὶ ζωὴν ἕως τοῦ αἰῶνος.

                                ΨΑΛΜ. ΡΛΓ΄. CXXXIII.

1 ᾨΔΗ τῶν ἀναβαθμῶν. Ἰδοὺ δὴ εὐλογεῖτε τὸν Κύριον πάντες
   οἱ δοῦλοι Κυρίου, οἱ ἑστῶτες ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου, ἐν αὐλαῖς οἴκου Θεοῦ
2 ἡμῶν· ἐν ταῖς νυξὶν ἐπάρατε τὰς χεῖρας ὑμῶν εἰς τὰ ἅγια, καὶ
3 εὐλογεῖτε τὸν Κύριον. Εὐλογήσαι σε Κύριος ἐκ Σιών, ὁ ποιήσας
   τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ τὴν γῆν.

                                ΨΑΛΜ. ΡΛΔ΄. CXXXIV.

1 ΑΛΛΗΛΟΥΪΑ. Αἰνεῖτε τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου, αἰνεῖτε δοῦλοι
2 Κύριον, οἱ ἑστῶτες ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου, ἐν αὐλαῖς οἴκου Θεοῦ ἡμῶν.
3 Αἰνεῖτε τὸν Κύριον, ὅτι ἀγαθὸς Κύριος· ψάλατε τῷ ὀνόματι αὐ-
4 τοῦ, ὅτι ἡδύ· ὅτι τὸν Ἰακὼβ ἐξελέξατο ἑαυτῷ ὁ Κύριος, Ἰσραὴλ
5 εἰς περιουσιασμὸν αὐτοῦ. Ὅτι ἐγὼ ἔγνων, ὅτι μέγας Κύριος, καὶ
6 ὁ Κύριος ἡμῶν παρὰ πάντας τοὺς Θεούς· πάντα ὅσα ἠθέλησεν ὁ
   Κύριος, ἐποίησεν ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ καὶ ἐν τῇ γῇ, ἐν ταῖς θαλάσσαις
7 καὶ ἐν πάσαις ταῖς ἀβύσσοις. Ἀνάγων νεφέλας ἐξ ἐσχάτου τῆς γῆς,
   ἀστραπὰς εἰς ὑετὸν ἐποίησεν· ὁ ἐξάγων ἀνέμους ἐκ θησαυρῶν αὐ-
8 τοῦ. Ὅς ἐπάταξε τὰ πρωτότοκα Αἰγύπτου, ἀπὸ ἀνθρώπου ἕως
9 κτήνους· ἐξαπέστειλε σημεῖα καὶ τέρατα ἐν μέσῳ σου Αἴγυπτε, ἐν
10 Φαραὼ καὶ ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς δούλοις αὐτοῦ. Ὅς ἐπάταξεν ἔθνη πολ-
11 λά, καὶ ἀπέκτεινε βασιλεῖς κραταιούς· τὸν Σηῶν βασιλέα τῶν
   Ἀμορραίων, καὶ τὸν Ὤγ βασιλέα τῆς Βασάν, καὶ πάσας τὰς βχ-

**PSALM 131 (LXX 131) - *continued***

**18** I have prepared a lamp for Mine Anointed;
   His enemies will I clothe with shame,
   but upon him shall My sacred glory blossom forth.

**PSALM 132 (LXX 132).**

*A Song of Ascents. By David.*
**1** Behold now, how good and how pleasant it is
   for brethren to dwell together in unity!
**2** It is as the precious oil upon the head,
   that runneth down upon the beard, even Aaron’s beard,
   that descendeth to the hem of his garments;
**3** As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descendeth upon the mountains of Zion:
   For there the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for evermore.

**PSALM 133 (LXX 133).**

*A Song of Ascents.*
**1** Behold now, bless ye the Lord, all ye servants of the Lord,
   who stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God.
**2** In the nights, lift up your hands unto the holy places,
   and **3** bless the Lord.
   The Lord bless thee out of Zion,
   He that made heaven and earth.

**PSALM 134 (LXX 134).**

*ALLELUIA.*
**1** Praise ye the Name of the Lord; praise [Him], O ye servants
**2** of the Lord, ye that stand in the house of the Lord,
   in the courts of the house of our God.
**3** Praise the Lord, for the Lord is good:
   sing praises unto His Name, for it is pleasant.
**4** For the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto Himself,
   and Israel **5** for His peculiar possession.
   For I know that the Lord is great,
   and **6** that our Lord is above all gods.
   Whatsoever the Lord hath pleased, that hath He done,
   in heaven, and in earth, in the seas,
**7** and in all deep places.
   He causeth the clouds to ascend from the ends of the earth;
   He maketh lightnings for the rain;
   He bringeth the winds out of His treasuries.
**8** Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, from man even unto
**9** beast. He sent signs and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt,
   upon **10** Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.
   Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;
**11** Sihon, king of the Amorites, and Og, king of Bashan,
   and all the [king]doms
