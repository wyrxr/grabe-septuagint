ΚΕΦ. ΙΒ΄.
3 σουσι, διότι οἶκος παραπικραίνων ἐστί. Καὶ σὺ υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, ποίησον σεαυτῷ σκεύη αἰχμαλωσίας, καὶ αἰχμαλωτισθήσῃ ἡμέρας ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν, καὶ αἰχμαλωτευθήσῃ ἐκ τοῦ τόπου σου εἰς ἕτερον τόπον ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν, ὅπως ἴδωσι, διότι οἶκος παραπικραίνων ἐστί.
4 Καὶ ἐξοίσεις τὰ σκεύη σου σκεύη αἰχμαλωσίας ἡμέρας κατ᾿ ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐξελεύσῃ σὺ ἑσπέρας ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν, ὡς ἐκπορεύεται αἰχμάλωτος.
5 Ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν διόρυξον σεαυτῷ εἰς τὸν τοῖχον,
6 καὶ διελεύσῃ δι᾿ αὐτοῦ. Ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν ἐπ᾿ ὤμων ἀναληφθήσῃ, καὶ κεκρυμμένος ἐξελεύσῃ, τὸ πρόσωπόν σου συγκαλύψεις, καὶ οὐ μὴ
7 ἴδῃς τὴν γῆν, διότι τέρας δέδωκά σε τῷ οἴκῳ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἐποίησα οὕτως κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἐνετείλατό μοι· καὶ σκεύη μου ἐξήνεγκα ὡς σκεύη αἰχμαλωσίας ἡμέρας, καὶ ἑσπέρας διώρυξα ἐμαυτῷ τὸν τοῖχον τῇ χειρί, καὶ κεκρυμμένος ἐξῆλθον, ἐπ᾿ ὤμων ἀνελήφθην ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν.
8 Καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς μὲ τὸ πρωΐ, λέγων·
9 Υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, οὐκ εἶπαν πρὸς σὲ ὁ οἶκος Ἰσραήλ, οἶκος ὁ παραπικραίνων, τί σὺ ποιεῖς;
10 Εἰπὸν πρὸς αὐτούς· Τάδε λέγει Κύριος Κύριος· εἰπὸν τῷ ἄρχοντι καὶ τῷ ἀφηγουμένῳ ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ καὶ
11 παντὶ οἴκῳ Ἰσραήλ, οἳ εἰσιν ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῶν, εἰπὸν, ὅτι ἐγὼ τέρατα ποιῶ ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῆς· ὃν τρόπον πεποίηκα, οὕτως ἔσται αὐτοῖς, ἐν
12 μετοικεσίᾳ καὶ ἐν αἰχμαλωσίᾳ πορεύσονται, καὶ ὁ ἄρχων αὐτῶν ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῶν ἐπ᾿ ὤμων ἀρθήσεται, καὶ κεκρυμμένος ἐξελεύσεται διὰ τοῦ τοίχου, καὶ διορύξει τοῦ ἐξελθεῖν αὐτὸν δι᾿ αὐτοῦ, τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ συγκαλύψει, ὅπως μὴ ὁραθῇ ὀφθαλμῷ, καὶ αὐτὸς τὴν
13 γῆν οὐκ ὄψεται. Καὶ ἐκπετάσω τὸ δίκτυόν μου ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν, καὶ συλληφθήσεται ἐν τῇ περιοχῇ μου, καὶ ἄξω αὐτὸν εἰς Βαβυλῶνα εἰς γῆν Χαλδαίων, καὶ αὐτὴν οὐκ ὄψεται, καὶ ἐκεῖ τελευτήσει.
14 Καὶ πάντας τοὺς κύκλῳ αὐτοῦ τοὺς βοηθοὺς αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντας τοὺς ἀντιλαμβανομένους αὐτοῦ διασπερῶ εἰς πάντα ἄνεμον, καὶ ῥομφαίαν ἐκκενώσω ὀπίσω αὐτῶν.
15 Καὶ γνώσονται, διότι ἐγὼ Κύριος, ἐν τῷ διασκορπίσαι με αὐτοὺς ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι, καὶ διασπερῶ αὐτοὺς ἐν ταῖς χώραις.
16 Καὶ ὑπολείψομαι ἐξ αὐτῶν ἄνδρας ἀριθμῷ ἐκ ῥομφαίας, καὶ ἐκ λιμοῦ καὶ ἐκ θανάτου, ὅπως ἐκδιηγήσωνται πάσας τὰς ἀνομίας αὐτῶν ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν, οὗ εἰσήλθοσαν ἐκεῖ,
17 καὶ γνώσονται ὅτι ἐγὼ Κύριος. Καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς
18 μὲ, λέγων· Υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, τὸν ἄρτον σου μετ᾿ ὀδύνης φάγεσαι, καὶ
19 τὸ ὕδωρ σου μετὰ βασάνου καὶ ἐκθλίψεως πίεσαι. Καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς

**3** [And they hear not,] for a house provoking [Me to] bitterness it is. And thou, son of man, make for thyself vessels of captivity; and thou shalt be led captive by day before their eyes. Yea, thou shalt be led captive from thy place unto another place before them, that they may see; for a house provoking [Me to] bitterness it is.
**4** And thou shalt bring forth thy vessels— [even] vessels of captivity— by day before their eyes; and thou shalt go forth in the evening before them, as one goeth forth into captivity.
**5** Before their eyes, dig for thyself into the wall,
**6** and thou shalt pass through it. Before their eyes, thou shalt be lifted upon [men's] shoulders, and shalt go forth hidden; thy face shalt thou cover, and thou shalt not
**7** see the land; for a sign have I made thee unto the house of Israel." And I did so according to all that He commanded me: I brought forth my vessels as vessels of captivity by day; and in the evening I dug for myself into the wall with my hand; and I went forth hidden, having been lifted upon [men's] shoulders before them.
**8** And in the morning, the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
**9** "Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, that house which provoketh [Me to] bitterness, said unto thee, 'What doest thou?'"
**10** "Say unto them, 'Thus saith the Lord God: Say unto the prince and the leader in Jerusalem, and
**11** unto all the house of Israel who are in their midst, say, "Behold, I do signs in her midst. In the manner that I have done, so shall it be unto them; in
**12** transmigration and in captivity shall they go. And their prince, in their midst, shall be carried upon [men's] shoulders; and he shall go forth hidden through the wall, and shall dig [a way] for himself to go out through it. His face shall he cover, that he may not be seen by [any] eye; and he himself shall not
**13** see the land. And I will spread My net upon him, and he shall be caught in My snare; and I will bring him to Babylon, unto the land of the Chaldeans; and he shall not see it, and there shall he die.
**14** And all that are round about him— his helpers, and all them that succour him— will I scatter unto every wind; and I will draw out a sword behind them.
**15** And they shall know that I am the Lord, when I scatter them among the nations, and disperse them in the lands.
**16** And I will leave of them a small number of men [delivered] from the sword, and from famine, and from death, that they may declare all their abominations among the nations whither they shall come;
**17** and they shall know that I am the Lord." And the word of the Lord came unto
**18** me, saying, "Son of man, thy bread shalt thou eat with anguish, and
**19** thy water shalt thou drink with trembling and with affliction. And thou shalt say unto
