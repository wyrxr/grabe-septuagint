**1** Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἀκοῦσαι τὸν βασιλέα Ἑζεκίαν, ἔσχισε τὰ ἱμάτια, καὶ σάκκον περιεβάλετο. καὶ ἀνέβη εἰς τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου,
**2** καὶ ἀπέστειλε τὸν Ἐλιακεὶμ τὸν οἰκονόμον, καὶ Σομνᾶν τὸν γραμματέα, καὶ τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους τῶν ἱερέων περιβεβλημένους σάκκους, πρὸς Ἡσαΐαν υἱὸν Ἀμὼς τὸν προφήτην,
**3** καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῷ· τάδε λέγει Ἑζεκίας· ἡμέρα θλίψεως καὶ ὀνειδισμοῦ καὶ ἐλεγμοῦ καὶ ὀργῆς ἡ σήμερον ἡμέρα, ὅτι ἥκει ἡ ὠδὶν τῇ τικτούσῃ, ἰσχὺν δὲ οὐκ ἔχει τοῦ τεκεῖν.
**4** Εἰσακούσαι Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου τοὺς λόγους Ῥαψάκου, ὃς ἀπέστειλεν αὐτὸν βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων ὀνειδίζειν Θεὸν ζῶντα, καὶ ὀνειδίζειν λόγους οὓς ἤκουσε Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου, καὶ δεηθήσῃ πρὸς Κύριόν σου περὶ τῶν καταλελειμμένων τούτων.
**5** Καὶ ἦλθον οἱ παῖδες τοῦ βασιλέως Ἑζεκίου πρὸς Ἡσαΐαν,
**6** καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς Ἡσαΐας· οὕτως ἐρεῖτε πρὸς τὸν Κύριον ὑμῶν· τάδε λέγει Κύριος· μὴ φοβηθῇς ἀπὸ τῶν λόγων ὧν ἤκουσας, οὓς ὠνείδισάν με οἱ πρέσβεις βασιλέως Ἀσσυρίων.
**7** Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐμβαλῶ εἰς αὐτὸν πνεῦμα, καὶ ἀκούσας ἀγγελίαν ἀποστραφήσεται εἰς τὴν χώραν αὐτοῦ, καὶ πεσεῖται μαχαίρᾳ ἐν τῇ γῇ αὐτοῦ.
**8** Καὶ ἀπέστρεψε Ῥαψάκης, καὶ κατέλαβε πολιορκοῦντα τὸν βασιλέα Ἀσσυρίων Λοβνά·
**9** καὶ ἤκουσε βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων, ὅτι ἀπέβη ἀπὸ Λαχείς, καὶ ἐξῆλθε Θαρακὰ βασιλεὺς Αἰθιόπων πολιορκῆσαι αὐτόν· καὶ ἀκούσας ἀπέστρεψε, καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ἀγγέλους πρὸς Ἑζεκίαν, λέγων.
**10** Οὕτως ἐρεῖτε Ἑζεκίᾳ βασιλεῖ τῆς Ἰουδαίας· μὴ σὲ ἀπατάτω ὁ Θεός σου, ἐφ᾿ ᾧ σὺ πεποιθὼς ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ, λέγων· οὐ μὴ παραδοθῇ Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐν χειρὶ βασιλέως Ἀσσυρίων.
**11** Ἢ σὺ οὐκ ἤκουσας, ἃ ἐποίησαν βασιλεῖς Ἀσσυρίων, πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν ὡς ἀπώλεσαν αὐτήν; καὶ σὺ ῥυσθήσῃ;
**12** Μὴ ἐῤῥύσαντο αὐτοὺς οἱ θεοὶ τῶν ἐθνῶν, οὓς οἱ πατέρες μου ἀπώλεσαν, τήν τε Γωζάν, καὶ Χαῤῥάν, καὶ Ῥαφεῖς, καὶ υἱοὺς Ἀδὰν οἱ εἰσιν ἐν χώρᾳ Θαιμάδ;
**13** Ποῦ εἰσιν οἱ βασιλεῖς Αἰμὰ καὶ Ἀῤῥάθ, καὶ βασιλεὺς πόλεως Σεπφαρείμ, Ἀναεγγουγαυά;
**14** Καὶ ἔλαβεν Ἑζεκίας τὸ βιβλίον παρὰ τῶν ἀγγέλων, καὶ ἀνέγνω αὐτό, καὶ ἀνέβη εἰς οἶκον Κυρίου, καὶ ἤνοιξεν αὐτὸ Ἑζεκίας ἐναντίον Κυρίου.
**15** Καὶ προσηύξατο Ἑζεκίας πρὸς

#### Chapter 37

**1** And it came to pass, when King Hezekiah heard [it], that he rent his garments, and clothed himself with sackcloth, and went up into the house of the Lord.
**2** And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, [all] clothed with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the son of Amoz the prophet.
**3** And they said unto him, "Thus saith Hezekiah: 'This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of disgrace, and of wrath; for the children are come to the birth, and there is no strength to bring forth.
**4** May the Lord thy God hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria hath sent him to reproach the living God, and to reproach the words which the Lord thy God heard; and do thou offer prayer unto thy Lord for this remnant that is left.'"
**5** So the servants of King Hezekiah came unto Isaiah.
**6** And Isaiah said unto them, "Thus shall ye say unto your lord: 'Thus saith the Lord: "Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard, with which the ambassadors of the king of Assyria have reproached Me.
**7** Behold, I shall put a spirit in him, and when he shall hear a report, he shall return unto his own land; and he shall fall by the sword in his own land."'"
**8** So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria besieging Libnah.
**9** And the king of Assyria heard [word] that he had departed from Lachish, and that Tirhakah king of Ethiopia was come forth to make war against him. And when he heard [it], he turned back, and sent messengers unto Hezekiah, saying,
**10** "Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, 'Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, "Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria."
**11** Or hast thou not heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands, how they utterly destroyed them? And shalt thou be delivered?
**12** Have the gods of the nations delivered them not, whom my fathers destroyed: both Gozan, and Haran, and Rapheis, and the sons of Eden which are in the land of Thaemad?
**13** Where are the kings of Hamath and Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Anaengougaoua?'"
**14** And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up into the house of the Lord, and spread it before the Lord.
**15** And Hezekiah prayed unto
