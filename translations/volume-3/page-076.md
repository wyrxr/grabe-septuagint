**ΨΑΛΜ. Ρ΄. C.**
8 ὀφθαλμῶν μου. Εἰς τὰς πρώτας ἀπέκτενον πάντας τοὺς ἁμαρτω-
    λοὺς τῆς γῆς, τοῦ ἐξολεθρεῦσαι ἐκ πόλεως Κυρίου πάντας τοὺς
    ἐργαζομένους τὴν ἀνομίαν.

**ΨΑΛΜ. PAʹ. CI.**

1 ΠΡΟΣΕΥΧΗ τῷ πτωχῷ, ὅταν ἀκηδιάσῃ, καὶ ἔναντι Κυρίου
2 ἐκχέῃ τὴν δέησιν αὐτοῦ. Κύριε εἰσάκουσον τῆς προσευχῆς μου,
3 καὶ ἡ κραυγή μου πρὸς σὲ ἐλθέτω. Μὴ ἀποστρέψῃς τὸ πρόσω-
    πόν σου ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ· ἐν ᾗ ἂν ἡμέρᾳ θλίβομαι, κλῖνον πρὸς μὲ τὸ οὖς
4 σου· ἐν ᾗ ἂν ἡμέρᾳ ἐπικαλέσωμαί σε, ταχὺ εἰσάκουσόν μου. Ὅτι
    ἐξέλειπον ὡσεὶ καπνὸς αἱ ἡμέραι μου, καὶ τὰ ὀστᾶ μου ὡσεὶ φρύ-
5 γιον συνεφρύγησαν. Ἐπλήγην ὡσεὶ χόρτος, καὶ ἐξηράνθη ἡ καρ-
6 δία μου, ὅτι ἐπελαθόμην τοῦ φαγεῖν τὸν ἄρτον μου. Ἀπὸ φωνῆς
7 τοῦ στεναγμοῦ μου ἐκολλήθη τὸ ὀστοῦν μου τῇ σαρκί μου. Ὁμοιώ-
8 θην πελεκᾶνι ἐρημικῷ, ἐγενήθην ὡσεὶ νυκτικορὰξ ἐν οἰκοπέδῳ· ἠγρύ-
9 πνησα καὶ ἐγενόμην ὡς στρουθίον μονάζον ἐπὶ δώματι. Ὅλην τὴν
    ἡμέραν ὠνείδιζόν με οἱ ἐχθροί μου, καὶ οἱ ἐπαινοῦντές με κατ᾿
10 ἐμοῦ ὤμνυον. Ὅτι σποδὸν ὡσεὶ ἄρτον ἔφαγον, καὶ τὸ πόμα μου
11 μετὰ κλαυθμοῦ ἐκίρνων, ἀπὸ προσώπου τῆς ὀργῆς σου καὶ τοῦ
12 θυμοῦ σου· ὅτι ἐπάρας κατέῤῥαξάς με. Αἱ ἡμέραι μου ὡσεὶ σκιὰ
13 ἐκκλίθησαν, καὶ ἐγὼ ὡσεὶ χόρτος ἐξηράνθην. Σὺ δὲ Κύριε εἰς τὸν
14 αἰῶνα μενεῖς, καὶ τὸ μνημόσυνόν σου εἰς γενεὰν καὶ γενεάν. Σὺ
    ἀναστὰς οἰκτειρήσεις τὴν Σιών· ὅτι καιρὸς τοῦ οἰκτειρῆσαι αὐ-
15 τήν, ὅτι ἥκει καιρός. Ὅτι εὐδόκησαν οἱ δοῦλοί σου τοὺς λίθους
16 αὐτῆς· καὶ τὸν χοῦν αὐτῆς οἰκτειρήσουσι. Καὶ φοβηθήσονται τὰ
    ἔθνη τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου, καὶ πάντες οἱ βασιλεῖς τῆς γῆς τὴν δόξαν
17 σου· ὅτι οἰκοδομήσει Κύριος τὴν Σιών, καὶ ὀφθήσεται ἐν τῇ δόξῃ
18 αὐτοῦ. Ἐπέβλεψεν ἐπὶ τὴν προσευχὴν τῶν ταπεινῶν, καὶ οὐκ
19 ἐξουδένωσε τὴν δέησιν αὐτῶν. Γραφήτω αὕτη εἰς γενεὰν ἑτέραν,
20 καὶ λαὸς ὁ κτιζόμενος αἰνέσει τὸν Κύριον· ὅτι ἐξέκυψεν ἐξ ὕψους
21 ἁγίου αὐτοῦ, Κύριος ἐξ οὐρανοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ἐπέβλεψε, τοῦ ἀκοῦ-
    σαι τὸν στεναγμὸν τῶν πεπεδημένων, τοῦ λῦσαι τοὺς υἱοὺς τῶν
22 τεθανατωμένων· τοῦ ἀναγγεῖλαι ἐν Σιὼν τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου, καὶ τὴν
23 αἴνεσιν αὐτοῦ ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, ἐν τῷ ἐπισυναχθῆναι λαοὺς ἐπὶ τὸ
24 αὐτὸ, καὶ βασιλείας τοῦ δουλεύειν τῷ Κυρίῳ. Ἀπεκρίθη αὐτῷ ἐν

**PSALM C.**
(continued)

6 ...mine eyes.
8 In the early morning hours would I slay all the sinners of the land,
   That I might utterly destroy all them that work iniquity
   Out of the city of the Lord.

**PSALM CI.**
A Prayer of the Afflicted, when he is overwhelmed
and poureth out his supplication before the Lord.

1 Hear my prayer, O Lord,
2 And let my cry come unto Thee.
3 Hide not Thy face from me;
   In whatsoever day I am afflicted,
   Incline Thine ear unto me;
4 In whatsoever day I call upon Thee,
   Speedily hear me.
5 For my days are vanished like smoke,
   And my bones are scorched as a frying-pan.
6 My heart is smitten like grass, and withered;
   For I have forgotten to eat my bread.
7 From the voice of my groaning,
   My bone cleaveth unto my flesh.
8 I am become like a pelican of the wilderness;
   I am made as a night-raven in a desolate place.
9 I have watched,
   And am become as a lonely sparrow upon the housetop.
10 All the day long mine enemies have reviled me,
    And they that did praise me have sworn against me.
11 For I have eaten ashes as it were bread,
    And mingled my drink with weeping,
12 Because of the presence of Thy wrath and Thine indignation;
    For having lifted me up, Thou hast cast me down.
13 My days are declined like a shadow,
    And I am withered like grass.
14 But Thou, O Lord, shalt endure forever,
    And Thy remembrance from generation to generation.
    Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Sion;
    For it is time to have mercy upon her, for the appointed time is come.
15 For Thy servants have taken pleasure in her stones,
    And shall pity her dust.
16 And the Gentiles shall fear the Name of the Lord,
    And all the kings of the earth Thy glory;
17 For the Lord shall build up Sion,
    And shall appear in His glory.
18 He hath looked upon the prayer of the humble,
    And hath not despised their supplication.
19 Let this be written for another generation,
20 And a people that shall be created shall praise the Lord;
21 For He hath looked down from His holy height,
    The Lord from heaven hath looked upon the earth,
    To hear the groaning of the fettered,
    To loose the sons of those that are appointed to death;
22 To declare the Name of the Lord in Sion,
    And His praise in Jerusalem,
23 When peoples are gathered together unto the same,
24 And kingdoms, to serve the Lord.
    He answered him in
