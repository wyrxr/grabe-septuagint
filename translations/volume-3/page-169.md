αὐτὸ εἰς ἄνω; καὶ πνεῦμα τοῦ κτήνους, εἰ καταβαίνει αὐτὸ κάτω
εἰς τὴν γῆν; Καὶ ἴδον ἔτι οὐκ ἔστιν ἀγαθὸν εἰ μὴ ὁ εὐφρανθήσεται 22
ἄνθρωπος ἐν ποιήμασιν αὐτοῦ, ὅτι αὐτὸ μερὶς αὐτοῦ· ἔτι τίς
ἄξει αὐτὸν τοῦ ἰδεῖν ἐν ᾧ ἂν γένηται μετ’ αὐτόν;

ΚΕΦ. Δ'. IV.

ΚΑὶ ἐπέστρεψα ἐγώ, καὶ ἴδον σὺν πάσας τὰς συκοφαντίας 1
τὰς γενομένας ὑπὸ τὸν ἥλιον· καὶ ἰδοὺ δάκρυον τῶν συκοφαντουμένων,
καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν αὐτοῖς παρακαλῶν· καὶ ἀπὸ χειρὸς συκοφαντούντων αὐτοὺς ἰσχύς,
καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν αὐτοῖς ὁ παρακαλῶν. Καὶ 2
ἐπήνεσα ἐγὼ σὺν τοὺς τεθνηκότας τοὺς ἤδη ἀποθανάντας ὑπὲρ
τοὺς ζῶντας, ὅσοι αὐτοὶ ζῶσιν ἕως τοῦ νῦν· καὶ ἀγαθὸς ὑπὲρ 3
τοὺς δύο τούτους ὅστις οὔπω ἐγένετο, ὃς οὐκ εἶδε σὺν τὸ ποίημα
τὸ πονηρὸν τὸ πεποιημένον ὑπὸ τὸν ἥλιον. Καὶ ἴδον ἐγὼ σὺν πάντα 4
τὸν μόχθον, καὶ σὺν πᾶσαν ἀνδρείαν τοῦ ποιήματος, ὅτι αὐτὸ
ζῆλος ἀνδρὸς ἀπὸ τοῦ ἑταίρου αὐτοῦ· καί γε τοῦτο ματαιότης καὶ
προαίρεσις πνεύματος. Ὁ ἄφρων περιέλαβε τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ, καὶ 5
ἔφαγε τὰς σάρκας αὐτοῦ. Ἀγαθὸν πλήρωμα δρακὸς ἀναπαύσεως, 6
ὑπὲρ πληρώματα δύο δρακῶν μόχθου καὶ προαιρέσεως πνεύματος.
Καὶ ἐπέστρεψα ἐγώ, καὶ ἴδον ματαιότητα ὑπὸ τὸν ἥλιον· 7
ἔστιν εἷς, καὶ οὐκ ἔστι δεύτερος, καὶ γε υἱὸς καὶ γε ἀδελφὸς οὐκ 8
ἔστιν αὐτῷ· καὶ οὐκ ἔστι περασμὸς τῷ παντὶ μόχθῳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ
γε ὀφθαλμὸς αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἐμπίπλαται πλούτου· καὶ τίνι ἐγὼ μοχθῶ,
καὶ στερίσκω τὴν ψυχήν μου ἀπὸ ἀγαθωσύνης; καί γε τοῦτο ματαιότης
καὶ περισπασμὸς πονηρός ἐστιν. Ἀγαθοὶ οἱ δύο ὑπὲρ τὸν 9
ἕνα, οἷς ἔστιν αὐτοῖς μισθὸς ἀγαθὸς ἐν μόχθῳ αὐτῶν· ἔτι ἐὰν πέσωσιν, 10
ὁ εἷς ἐγερεῖ τὸν μέτοχον αὐτοῦ· καὶ οὐαὶ αὐτῷ τῷ ἑνί,
ὅταν πέσῃ, καὶ μὴ ᾖ δεύτερος, τοῦ ἐγεῖραι αὐτόν. Καί γε ἐὰν κοιμηθῶσιν 11
οἱ δύο, καὶ θέρμη αὐτοῖς· καὶ ὁ εἷς πῶς θερμανθῇ; Καὶ 12
ἐὰν ἐπικραταιωθῇ ὁ εἷς, οἱ δύο στήσονται κατέναντι αὐτοῦ· καὶ τὸ
σπαρτίον τὸ ἔντριτον οὐ ταχέως ἀποῤῥαγήσεται. Ἀγαθὸς παῖς 13
πένης καὶ σοφὸς ὑπὲρ βασιλέα πρεσβύτερον καὶ ἄφρονα, ὃς οὐκ
ἔγνω τοῦ προσέχειν ἔτι. Ὅτι ἐξ οἴκου τῶν δεδίων ἐξελεύσεται 14
τοῦ βασιλεῦσαι· ὅτι καί γε ἐν βασιλείᾳ αὐτοῦ ἐγενήθη πένης. Ἴδον 15
σὺν πάντας τοὺς ζῶντας τοὺς περιπατοῦντας ὑπὸ τὸν ἥλιον, μετὰ

**CHAPTER 3**

...whether it ascendeth upward? And the spirit of the beast, whether it descendeth downward to the earth?
**22** And I saw further that there is no good,
    save that man should rejoice in his own works;
    for this is his portion.
**23** For who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?

**CHAPTER 4**

**1** And I returned, and saw even all the oppressions
    that are done under the sun:
    and behold, the tears of them that were oppressed,
    and they had no comforter;
    and from the hand of their oppressors there was power,
    but for them there was no comforter.
**2** Wherefore I praised, even, the dead which are already dead,
    more than the living which are yet alive.
**3** Yea, better than both these is he who hath not yet been,
    who hath not seen even the evil work
    that is done under the sun.
**4** Then I saw even all the toil,
    and even all the skill of work,
    that it is a man's envy of his neighbour;
    and verily, this also is vanity and a vexation of spirit.
**5** The fool foldeth his hands together,
    and eateth his own flesh.
**6** Better is a handful with rest,
    than two handfuls with toil and vexation of spirit.
**7** And I returned, and saw a vanity under the sun.
**8** There is one alone, and there is no second;
    yea, he hath neither son nor brother;
    yet is there no end to all his labour,
    neither is his eye satisfied with riches.
    And [he saith], "For whom do I labour,
    and bereave my soul of good?"
    This also is vanity, and a grievous vexation.
**9** Two are better than one;
    because they have a good reward for their labour.
**10** For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow;
    but woe to him that is alone when he falleth,
    for he hath not a second to lift him up.
**11** Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth;
    but how can one alone be warm?
**12** And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him;
    and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.
**13** Better is a poor and wise child
    than an old and foolish king,
    who knoweth not how to receive admonition any more.
**14** For out of the house of those who feared shall he come forth to reign;
    for verily, even in his kingdom, was he born poor.
**15** I saw even all the living who walked under the sun,
    with the second young man, who shall stand in his stead.
