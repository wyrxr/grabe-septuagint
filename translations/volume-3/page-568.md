ΣΟΦΟΝΙΑΣ. ΚΕΦΑΛΑΙΟΝ Α.

1 ΛΟΓΟΣ Κυρίου, ὃς ἐγενήθη πρὸς Σοφονίαν τὸν τοῦ Χουσεὶ
υἱὸν Γοδολίου, τοῦ Ἀμορίου, τοῦ Ἑζεκίου, ἐν ἡμέραις Ἰωσίου
2 υἱοῦ Ἀμὼν βασιλέως Ἰούδα. Ἐκλείψει ἐκλειπέτω ἀπὸ προσώπου
3 τῆς γῆς, λέγει Κύριος· ἐκλειπέτω ἄνθρωπος καὶ κτήνη, ἐκλειπέτωσαν τὰ πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ οἱ ἰχθύες τῆς θαλάσσης· καὶ
ἀσθενήσουσιν οἱ ἀσεβεῖς, καὶ ἐξαρῶ τοὺς ἀνόμους ἀπὸ προσώπου
4 τῆς γῆς, λέγει Κύριος. Καὶ ἐκτενῶ τὴν χεῖρά μου ἐπὶ Ἰούδα, καὶ
ἐπὶ πάντας τοὺς κατοικοῦντας Ἱερουσαλήμ· καὶ ἐξαρῶ ἐκ τοῦ
τόπου τούτου τὰ ὀνόματα τῆς Βάαλ, καὶ τὰ ὀνόματα τῶν ἱερέων,
5 καὶ τοὺς προσκυνοῦντας ἐπὶ τὰ δώματα τῇ στρατιᾷ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ,
καὶ τοὺς προσκυνοῦντας καὶ τοὺς ὀμνύοντας κατὰ τοῦ Κυρίου, καὶ
6 τοὺς ὀμνύοντας κατὰ τοῦ βασιλέως αὐτῶν, καὶ τοὺς ἐκκλίνοντας
ἀπὸ τοῦ Κυρίου, καὶ τοὺς μὴ ζητήσαντας τὸν Κύριον, καὶ τοὺς
7 μὴ ἀντεχομένους τοῦ Κυρίου. Εὐλαβεῖσθε ἀπὸ προσώπου Κυρίου
τοῦ Θεοῦ, διότι ἐγγὺς ἡ ἡμέρα τοῦ Κυρίου, ὅτι ἡτοίμασε Κύριος
8 τὴν θυσίαν αὐτοῦ, ἡγίασε τοὺς κλητοὺς αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἔσται, ἐν ἡμέρᾳ θυσίας Κυρίου, καὶ ἐκδικήσω ἐπὶ τοὺς ἄρχοντας, καὶ ἐπὶ
τὸν οἶκον τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ ἐπὶ πάντας τοὺς ἐνδεδυμένους ἐνδύματα ἀλλότρια·
9 καὶ ἐκδικήσω ἐπὶ πάντας ἐμφανῶς ἐπὶ τὰ πρόπυλα
ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ. τοὺς πληροῦντας τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ
10 αὐτῶν ἀνομίας καὶ δόλου. Καὶ ἔσται ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ, λέγει
Κύριος, φωνὴ κραυγῆς ἀπὸ πύλης ἀποκεντούντων, ὁλολυγμὸς ἀπὸ
11 τῆς δευτέρας, καὶ συντριμμὸς μέγας ἀπὸ τῶν βουνῶν. Θρηνήσατε οἱ
κατοικοῦντες τὴν κατακεκομμένην, ὅτι ὡμοιώθη πᾶς ὁ λαὸς Χαναάν, ἐξωλεθρεύθησαν πάντες οἱ ἐπηρμένοι ἀργυρίῳ.
12 Καὶ ἔσται ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ, ἐξερευνήσω τὴν Ἱερουσαλὴμ μετὰ λύχνου, καὶ ἐκδικήσω ἐπὶ τοὺς ἄνδρας τοὺς καταφρονοῦντας ἐπὶ τὰ φυλάγματα αὐτῶν· οἱ λέγοντες ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις αὐτῶν· οὐ μὴ ἀγαθοποιήσῃ Κύριος, οὐδ᾽ οὐ μὴ κακώσῃ.
13 Καὶ ἔσται ἡ δύναμις αὐτῶν εἰς διαρπαγήν, καὶ οἱ οἶκοι αὐτῶν εἰς ἀφανισμόν· καὶ οἰκοδομή-

**ZEPHANIAH. Chapter 1.**

**1** The word of the Lord, which came unto Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah.

**2** It shall utterly, utterly cease to be from the face of the earth, saith the Lord.

**3** Let man and beast perish; let the birds of the heaven and the fish of the sea perish; and the impious shall grow faint, and I will remove the lawless from the face of the earth, saith the Lord.

**4** And I will stretch forth My hand upon Judah, and upon all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and I will remove from this place the names of Baal, and the names of the priests,

**5** And them that worship upon the housetops the host of heaven; and them that worship and them that swear by the Lord,

**6** And them that swear by their king; and them that turn away from the Lord, and them that have not sought the Lord, and them that have not held fast to the Lord.

**7** Be in awe before the face of the Lord God, for the day of the Lord is nigh; for the Lord hath prepared His sacrifice, and hath sanctified His invited [guests].

**8** And it shall come to pass, in the day of the Lord’s sacrifice, that I will take vengeance upon the princes, and upon the king's house, and upon all them that are clothed in foreign raiment;

**9** And I will take vengeance upon all them that are found openly at the thresholds in that day, [even] those that fill the house of the Lord their God with lawlessness and deceit.

**10** And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, that there shall be a voice of crying from the gate of the pierced ones, and a wailing from the second [quarter of the city], and a great crashing from the hills.

**11** Wail, ye inhabitants of the Cut-down [Quarter], for all the people were likened to Canaan; all them that are lifted up by silver have been utterly destroyed.

**12** And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will search Jerusalem with a lamp, and I will take vengeance upon the men who scorn their observances; who say in their hearts: "The Lord will never do good, neither will He ever do evil."

**13** And their wealth shall become a prey, and their houses a desolation; and they shall build—
