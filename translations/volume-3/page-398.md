αὐτῶν τῇ ἐκπορνευούσῃ (ἀπ’ ἐμοῦ) τῇ ἀποστάσῃ ἀπ’ ἐμοῦ, καὶ
τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτῶν τοῖς ἐκπορνεύουσιν ὀπίσω τῶν ἐπιτηδευ-
μάτων αὐτῶν· καὶ κόψονται τὰ πρόσωπα αὐτῶν περὶ τῶν κα-
κιῶν, ὧν ἐποίησαν ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς βδελύγμασιν αὐτῶν (καὶ ἐν πᾶσι
10 τοῖς ἐπιτηδεύμασιν αὐτῶν.) Καὶ ἐπιγνώσονται ὅτι ἐγὼ Κύριος
οὐκ εἰς δωρεὰν λελάληκα τοῦ ποιῆσαι αὐτοῖς ἅπαντα τὰ κακὰ
11 ταῦτα. Τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναὶ Κύριος· κρότησον τῇ χειρὶ καὶ
ψόφησον τῷ ποδί, καὶ εἰπὸν, εὖγε εὖγε ἐπὶ πᾶσι τοῖς βδελύ-
γμασιν οἴκου Ἰσραήλ· ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ καὶ ἐν θανάτῳ καὶ ἐν λιμῷ
12 πεσοῦνται. Ὁ ἐγγὺς ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ πεσεῖται, ὁ δὲ μακρὰν ἐν θανάτῳ
τελευτήσει, καὶ ὁ ὑπολειφθεὶς καὶ ὁ περιεχόμενος ἐν λιμῷ συντε-
λεσθήσεται· καὶ συντελέσω τὴν ὀργήν μου ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς, καὶ γνώ-
13 σεσθε διότι ἐγὼ Κύριος· ἐν τῷ εἶναι τοὺς τραυματίας ὑμῶν
ἐν μέσῳ τῶν εἰδώλων ὑμῶν κύκλῳ τῶν θυσιαστηρίων ὑμῶν ἐπὶ
πάντα βουνὸν ὑψηλὸν καὶ ἐν πάσαις κορυφαῖς τῶν ὀρέων καὶ ὑπο-
κάτω δένδρου συσκίου καὶ ὑποκάτω πάσης δρυὸς δασείας, οὗ
14 ἔδωκαν ἐκεῖ ὀσμὴν εὐωδίας πᾶσι τοῖς εἰδώλοις αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐκ-
τενῶ τὴν χεῖρά μου ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς, καὶ θήσομαι τὴν γῆν εἰς ἀφα-
νισμὸν καὶ εἰς ὄλεθρον ἀπὸ τῆς ἐρήμου Δεβλαθὰ ἐκ πάσης τῆς
κατοικίας αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπιγνώσεσθε, ὅτι ἐγὼ Κύριος.

ΚΕΦ. Ζ΄. VII.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς με, λέγων·
2 καὶ σὺ υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου εἰπὸν, τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναὶ Κύριος, τῇ γῇ τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ πέρας ἥκει, τὸ πέρας ἥκει ἐπὶ τὰς τέσσαρας πτέρυγας τῆς γῆς. 3 Ἤκει τὸ πέρας, νῦν τὸ πέρας πρὸς σὲ, καὶ ἀποστελῶ ἐγὼ ἐπὶ σὲ, καὶ
ἐκδικήσω σε ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς σου, καὶ δώσω ἐπὶ σὲ πάντα τὰ
4 βδελύγματά σου. Οὐ φείσεται ὁ ὀφθαλμός μου ἐπὶ σὲ, οὐδὲ μὴ
ἐλεήσω· διότι τὴν ὁδόν σου ἐπὶ σὲ δώσω, καὶ τὰ βδελύγματά
5 σου ἐν μέσῳ σου ἔσται, καὶ γνώσῃ ὅτι ἐγὼ Κύριος. Διότι τάδε
6 λέγει Κύριος· κακία μία, κακία ἰδοὺ ἔρχεται. Τὸ πέρας ἥκει,
7 ἥκει τὸ πέρας, ἐξηγέρθη πρὸς σὲ, ἰδοὺ ἥκει τὸ πέρας. Ἤκει ἡ
πλοκὴ ἐπὶ σὲ τὸν κατοικοῦντα τὴν γῆν· ἥκει ὁ καιρὸς, ἤγγικεν ἡ
8 ἡμέρα, οὐ μετὰ θορύβων, οὐδὲ μετ’ ὠδίνων. Νῦν ἐγγύθεν ἐκχεῶ
τὴν ὀργήν μου ἐπὶ σὲ, καὶ συντελέσω τὸν θυμόν μου ἐν σοὶ, καὶ

### Chapter 6

**9** ...[for I have sworn] unto their heart which hath gone a-whoring (from Me), which hath departed from Me; and unto their eyes which go a-whoring after their [evil] practices. And they shall smite their faces for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations (and in all their practices).
**10** And they shall know that I, the Lord, have not spoken in vain, nor [without cause] brought all these evils upon them.
**11** Thus saith Adonai the Lord: Clap with thine hand, and stamp with thy foot, and say, "Woe! Woe!" for all the abominations of the house of Israel; for they shall fall by the sword, by pestilence, and by famine.
**12** He that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that is far off shall die by pestilence; and he that is left, and he that is besieged, shall be consumed by famine. And I will accomplish My wrath upon them, and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
**13** When your slain shall lie in the midst of your idols, round about your altars, upon every high hill, and on all the tops of the mountains, and under every shady tree, and under every thick oak, in every place where they offered there a sweet savor to all their idols.
**14** And I will stretch forth My hand upon them, and I will make the land a desolation and a destruction from the wilderness of Deblatha, from all their dwelling places; and ye shall know that I am the Lord.

### Chapter 7

**1** And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying:
**2** And thou, son of man, say, Thus saith Adonai the Lord to the land of Israel: The end is come, the end is come upon the four corners of the land.
**3** The end is come, now the end is upon thee; and I will send forth My [judgment] upon thee, and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and I will bring upon thee all thine abominations.
**4** My eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity; for I will bring thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in thy midst; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord.
**5** For thus saith the Lord: A calamity, a singular calamity, behold, it cometh.
**6** The end is come, the end is come; it hath awakened against thee; behold, the end is come.
**7** The snare is come upon thee, O thou that dwellest in the land. The time is come, the day is at hand, not with tumultuous shouting, neither with birth pangs.
**8** Now, from nearby, will I pour out My wrath upon thee, and I will accomplish My fury in thee, and
