#### Original Text with Light OCR Corrections

ΚΕΦ. ΚΓʹ.
μέραι ἔρχονται, λέγει Κύριος, καὶ ἀναστήσω τῷ Δαυὶδ ἀνατο-
λὴν δικαίαν, καὶ βασιλεύσει βασιλεὺς, καὶ συνήσει, καὶ ποιήσει
6 κρῖμα καὶ δικαιοσύνην ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς. Ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις αὐτοῦ καὶ
σωθήσεται Ἰούδας, καὶ Ἰσραὴλ κατασκηνώσει πεποιθὼς, καὶ
τοῦτο τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ, ὃ καλέσει αὐτὸν Κύριος, Ἰωσεδέκ. Ἐν
9 τοῖς προφήταις. Συνετρίβη ἡ καρδία μου ἐν ἐμοὶ, ἐσαλεύθη πάν-
τα τὰ ὀστᾶ μου, ἐγεννήθην ὡς ἄνθρωπος συντετριμμένος,
καὶ ὡς ἄνθρωπος συνεχόμενος ἀπὸ οἴνου ἀπὸ προσώπου Κυρίου
10 καὶ ἀπὸ προσώπου εὐπρεπείας δόξης αὐτοῦ. Ὅτι μοιχῶν ἕνεκεν ἐπλήσθη ἡ γῆ, ὅτι ἀπὸ προσώπου τούτων ἐπένθησεν ἡ γῆ,
ἐξηράνθησαν αἱ νομαὶ τῆς ἐρήμου· καὶ ἐγένετο ὁ δρόμος αὐ-
11 τῶν πονηρὸς, καὶ ἡ ἰσχὺς αὐτῶν οὐχ οὕτως. Ὅτι ἱερεὺς καὶ
προφήτης ἐμολύνθησαν, καὶ ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ μου ἴδον πονηρίας αὐτῶν,
12 φησὶ Κύριος. Διὰ τοῦτο γενέσθω ἡ ὁδὸς αὐτῶν αὐτοῖς εἰς ὀλί-
σθημα ἐν γνόφῳ, καὶ ὑποσκελισθήσονται, καὶ πεσοῦνται ἐν αὐτῇ·
διότι ἐπάξω ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς κακὰ, ἐν ἐνιαυτῷ ἐπισκέψεως αὐτῶν,
13 φησὶ Κύριος. Καὶ ἐν τοῖς προφήταις Σαμαρείας ἴδον ἀνομήματα·
ἐπροφήτευσαν ἐπ᾿ ὀνόματί μου διὰ τῆς Βάαλ, καὶ ἐπλάνησαν
14 τὸν λαόν μου Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἐν τοῖς προφήταις Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἑώρακα φρικτὰ, μοιχωμένους καὶ πορευομένους ἐν ψεύδεσι, καὶ
ἀντιλαμβανομένους χειρῶν πονηρῶν, τοῦ μὴ ἀποστραφῆναι ἕκα-
στον ἀπὸ τῆς ὁδοῦ αὐτοῦ τῆς πονηρᾶς· ἐγεννήθησάν μοι πάντες
15 ὡς Σόδομα, καὶ οἱ κατοικοῦντες αὐτὴν ὡς Γόμοῤῥα. Διὰ τοῦτο
τάδε λέγει Κύριος τῶν δυνάμεων ἐπὶ τοὺς προφήτας· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ
ψωμίζω αὐτοὺς ὀδύνην, καὶ ποτιῶ αὐτοὺς ὕδωρ πικρὸν, ἔτι ἀπὸ
16 τῶν προφητῶν Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐξῆλθε μολυσμὸς πάσῃ τῇ γῇ. Οὕ-
τως λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ· μὴ ἀκούετε τοὺς λόγους τῶν
προφητῶν τῶν προφητευόντων ὑμῖν, ὅτι ματαιοῦσιν αὐτοὶ ὑμᾶς,
δράσεις, ἀπὸ καρδίας ἑαυτῶν λαλοῦσι, καὶ οὐκ ἀπὸ στό-
17 ματος Κυρίου. Λέγουσι λέγοντες τοῖς ἀπωθουμένοις τὸν λόγον
Κυρίου· εἰρήνη ἔσται ὑμῖν, καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς πορευομένοις τοῖς θε-
λήμασιν αὐτῶν, καὶ παντὶ τῷ πορευομένῳ πλάνῃ καρδίας αὐτοῦ,
18 εἶπαν· οὐχ ἥξει ἐπὶ σὲ κακά. Ὅτι τίς ἐστιν ἐν ὑποστήματι Κυ-
ρίου, καὶ ἴδε καὶ ἤκουσε τὸν λόγον αὐτοῦ; τίς ἐνωτίσατο τὸν
19 λόγον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἤκουσεν; Ἰδοὺ σεισμὸς παρὰ Κυρίου, καὶ ὀρ-
γὴ ἐκπορεύεται εἰς συσσεισμὸν, συστρεφομένη ἥξει ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀσε-

**5** The days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise up unto David a righteous Branch; and a King shall reign, and shall understand, and shall execute judgment and righteousness upon the earth.
**6** In His days also Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell in confident security; and this is His Name whereby the Lord shall call Him: Iosedek.

**9** *Concerning the Prophets.* My heart is broken within me, all my bones are shaken; I have become as a man who is crushed, and as a man overcome by wine, from the presence of the Lord and from the presence of the splendour of His glory.
**10** For the land is full on account of adulterers; surely on account of these the land hath mourned, the pastures of the wilderness have dried up. And their course became evil, and their strength is not so.
**11** For both priest and prophet are defiled; yea, in My House have I seen their wickedness, saith the Lord.

**13** And in the prophets of Samaria have I seen transgressions: they prophesied in My Name through Baal, and they led My people Israel astray.
**14** And in the prophets of Jerusalem have I beheld horrible things: [they are] adulterers and walk in lies, and they strengthen the hands of the wicked, so that no man doth turn back from his evil way. All of them are become unto Me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.
**15** Therefore thus saith the Lord of Hosts concerning the prophets: 'Behold, I will feed them pain, and I will make them drink bitter water; for from the prophets of Jerusalem hath pollution gone forth into all the land.'
**16** Thus saith the Lord Almighty: 'Hearken not unto the words of the prophets who prophesy unto you; for they themselves do make you vain with deeds, [and] from their own heart they speak, and not from the mouth of the Lord.
**17** They say, saying unto those who reject the word of the Lord, "Peace shall be unto you"; and unto all that walk in their own desires, and to every one that walketh in the error of his heart, they have said: "No evil shall come upon thee."
**18** For who among them hath stood in the counsel of the Lord, and hath seen and heard His word? Who hath given ear unto His word, and hath heard it?
