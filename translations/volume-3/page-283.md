ΚΕΦ. Ε´. ΙΕΡΕΜΙΑΣ
2  αὐτοῖς, λέγει Κύριος. Ζῇ Κύριος, λέγουσι, διὰ τοῦτο οὐχ ἐπὶ ψεύδεσιν ὀμνύουσι.
3  Κύριε, οἱ ὀφθαλμοί σου εἰς πίστιν, ἐμαστίγωσας αὐτούς, καὶ οὐκ ἐπόνεσαν, συνετέλεσας αὐτούς, καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησαν δέξασθαι παιδείαν· ἐστερέωσαν τὰ πρόσωπα αὐτῶν ὑπὲρ πέτραν, καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησαν ἐπιστραφῆναι.
4  Καὶ ἐγὼ εἶπα· ἴσως πτωχοί εἰσι, διὰ τοῦτο οὐκ ἠδυνήθησαν, ὅτι οὐκ ἔγνωσαν ὁδὸν Κυρίου, καὶ κρίσιν Θεοῦ.
5  Πορεύσομαι πρὸς τοὺς ἀδρούς, καὶ λαλήσω πρὸς αὐτούς, ὅτι αὐτοὶ ἐπέγνωσαν ὁδὸν Κυρίου, καὶ κρίσιν Θεοῦ· καὶ ἰδοὺ ὁμοθυμαδὸν συνέτριψαν ζυγόν, διέρρηξαν δεσμούς.
6  Διὰ τοῦτο ἔπαισεν αὐτοὺς λέων ἐκ δρυμοῦ, καὶ λύκος ἕως τῶν οἰκιῶν ὠλέθρευσεν αὐτούς, καὶ πάρδαλις ἐγρηγόρησεν ἐπὶ τὰς πόλεις αὐτῶν· πάντες οἱ ἐκπορευόμενοι ἐπ᾿ αὐτῶν θηρευθήσονται, ὅτι ἐπλήθυναν ἀσεβείας αὐτῶν, καὶ ἴσχυσαν ἐν ταῖς ἀποστροφαῖς αὐτῶν.
7  Ποίᾳ τούτων ἵλεως γένομαι σοι; οἱ υἱοί σου ἐγκατέλιπόν με, καὶ ὤμνυον ἐν τοῖς οὐκ οὖσι Θεοῖς· καὶ ἐχόρτασα αὐτούς, καὶ ἐμοιχεύοντο, καὶ ἐν οἴκοις πορνῶν κατέλυον.
8  Ἵπποι θηλυμανεῖς ἐγενήθησαν, ἕκαστος ἐπὶ τὴν γυναῖκα τοῦ πλησίον αὐτοῦ ἐχρεμέτιζον.
9  Μὴ ἐπὶ τούτοις οὐκ ἐπισκέψομαι, λέγει Κύριος; ἢ ἐν ἔθνει τοιούτῳ οὐκ ἐκδικήσει ἡ ψυχή μου;
10 Ἀνάβητε ἐπὶ τοὺς προμαχῶνας αὐτῆς, καὶ κατασκάψατε, συντέλειαν δὲ οὐ μὴ ποιήσητε· ὑπολίπεσθε τὰ ὑποστηρίγματα αὐτῆς, ὅτι τοῦ Κυρίου εἰσίν, ὅτι ἀθετῶν ἠθέτησεν εἰς ἐμὲ οἶκος Ἰσραήλ, καὶ οἶκος Ἰούδα
11 ἐψεύσατο τῷ Κυρίῳ αὐτῶν, καὶ εἶπαν, οὐκ ἔστι ταῦτα·
12 οὐχ ἥξει ἐφ᾿ ἡμᾶς κακά, καὶ μάχαιραν καὶ λιμὸν οὐκ ὀψόμεθα.
13 Οἱ προφῆται ἡμῶν ἦσαν εἰς ἄνεμον, καὶ λόγος Κυρίου οὐχ ὑπῆρχεν ἐν αὐτοῖς· οὕτως ἔσται αὐτοῖς.
14 Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ· ἀνθ᾿ ὧν ἐλαλήσατε τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο, ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ δέδωκα τοὺς λόγους μου εἰς τὸ στόμα σου πῦρ, καὶ τὸν λαὸν τοῦτον ξύλα, καὶ καταφάγεται αὐτούς.
15 Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐπάγω ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς ἔθνος πόρρωθεν οἶκος Ἰσραήλ, λέγει Κύριος· ἔθνος ἀρχαῖόν ἐστιν, ἔθνος ἀπ᾿ αἰῶνος, ἔθνος οὗ οὐκ ἀκούσῃ τῆς φωνῆς αὐτοῦ·
16 ἡ φαρέτρα αὐτοῦ ὡς τάφος ἀνεῳγμένος· πάντες ἰσχυροί, καὶ κατέδονται
17 τὸν θερισμὸν ὑμῶν, καὶ τοὺς ἄρτους ὑμῶν, καὶ κατέδονται τοὺς υἱοὺς ὑμῶν, καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας ὑμῶν, καὶ κατέδονται τὰ πρόβατα ὑμῶν καὶ τοὺς μόσχους ὑμῶν, καὶ κατέδονται τοὺς ἀμπελῶνας ὑμῶν, καὶ τοὺς συκῶνας ὑμῶν καὶ τοὺς ἐλαιῶνας ὑμῶν·

### Chapter 5

**2** [unto them,] saith the Lord. "As the Lord liveth," say they, yet thereby they swear not upon falsehoods.
**3** O Lord, Thine eyes are set upon faithfulness. Thou hast scourged them, yet they have not grieved; Thou hast consumed them, yet they would not receive instruction. They made their faces harder than the rock, and would not turn back.
**4** And I said, "Perhaps they are poor, therefore they were not able [to obey], because they knew not the way of the Lord, nor the judgment of God."
**5** "I will go unto the stout ones, and I will speak unto them, for they themselves have known the way of the Lord and the judgment of God." But behold, with one accord they have broken the yoke, and burst the bonds.
**6** Therefore hath a lion from the forest smitten them, and a wolf from [among] the houses hath destroyed them, and a leopard hath watched over their cities. All who go forth from among them shall be hunted, because they have multiplied their impieties, and strengthened themselves in their backslidings.
**7** For which of these things shall I be merciful unto thee? Thy sons have forsaken Me, and sworn by those who are not Gods. And when I had filled them [to satiety], they committed adultery, and lodged in the houses of harlots.
**8** They became horses mad for mares, each one neighed after his neighbor's wife.
**9** Shall I not visit for these things, saith the Lord? Or shall My soul not take vengeance on such a nation?
**10** Go ye up upon her battlements, and lay them waste; yet make not a full end. Leave her supports, for they are the Lord's, because the house of Israel and the house of Judah have utterly rejected Me.
**11** They have dealt falsely with their Lord, and have said, "These things are not so;
**12** no evils shall come upon us, neither shall we see sword nor famine."
**13** Our prophets were as wind, and the word of the Lord was not in them. So shall it be unto them.
**14** Therefore thus saith the Lord Almighty: "Because ye have spoken this word, behold, I have put My words in thy mouth [as] fire, and this people [as] wood, and it shall consume them.
**15** Behold, I bring upon you a nation from afar, O house of Israel," saith the Lord. "It is an ancient nation, a nation from everlasting, a nation whose voice thou shalt not understand.
**16** Its quiver is as an open sepulchre; all of them are mighty, and they shall devour
**17** your harvest and your bread; and they shall devour your sons and your daughters; and they shall devour your sheep and your calves; and they shall devour your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive groves."
