ΚΕΦ. Αʹ. ΑΒΔΕΙΟΥ. 1493
τοῦ ἐξολεθρεῦσαι τοὺς ἀνασωζομένους αὐτῶν, μηδὲ συγκλείσῃς
τοὺς φεύγοντας αὐτοῦ ἐν ἡμέρᾳ θλίψεως. Διότι ἐγγὺς ἡ ἡμέρα 15
τοῦ Κυρίου ἐπὶ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη· ὃν τρόπον ἐποίησας, οὕτως ἔσται
σοι, τὸ ἀνταπόδομά σου ἀνταποδοθήσεται εἰς κεφαλήν σου· διότι 16
ὃν τρόπον ἔπιες ἐπὶ τὸ ὄρος τὸ ἅγιόν μου, πίονται πάντα τὰ ἔθνη
οἶνον, πίονται καὶ καταβήσονται, καὶ ἔσονται καθὼς οὐχ ὑπάρ-
χοντες. Ἐν δὲ τῷ ὄρει Σιὼν ἔσται ἡ σωτηρία, καὶ ἔσται ἅγιον· 17
καὶ κατακληρονομήσουσιν ὁ οἶκος Ἰακώβ, τοὺς κατακληρονομή-
σαντας αὐτούς· καὶ ἔσται ὁ οἶκος Ἰακὼβ πῦρ, ὁ δὲ οἶκος Ἰω- 18
σὴφ φλόξ, ὁ δὲ οἶκος Ἠσαῦ εἰς καλάμην, καὶ ἐκκαυθήσονται εἰς
αὐτούς, καὶ καταφάγονται αὐτούς, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται πυρφόρος ἐν τῷ
οἴκῳ Ἠσαῦ, διότι Κύριος ἐλάλησε. Καὶ κατακληρονομήσουσιν 19
οἱ ἐν Ναγὲβ τὸ ὄρος τὸ Ἠσαῦ, καὶ οἱ ἐν τῇ Σεφηλὰ τοὺς ἀλ-
λοφύλους· καὶ κατακληρονομήσουσι τὸ ὄρος Ἐφραΐμ, καὶ τὸ πε-
δίον Σαμαρείας, καὶ Βενιαμίν, καὶ τὴν Γαλααδῖτιν. Καὶ τῆς 20
μετοικεσίας ἡ ἀρχὴ αὕτη τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ, τῇ τῶν Χαναναίων
ἕως Σαρέπτων, καὶ ἡ μετοικεσία Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἕως Σεφραθά καὶ
κληρονομήσουσι τὰς πόλεις τοῦ Ναγέβ. Καὶ ἀναβήσονται ἀνα- 21
σωζόμενοι ἐξ ὄρους Σιών, τοῦ ἐκδικῆσαι τὸ ὄρος Ἠσαῦ· καὶ ἔσται
τῷ Κυρίῳ ἡ βασιλεία.

ΑΒΔΕΙΟΥ Εʹ.

**14** ...to utterly destroy those of their own that did escape, neither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his own that fled in the day of distress.

**15** For near is the Day of the LORD upon all the nations. As thou hast done, so shall it be done unto thee; thy recompense shall be returned upon thine own head.

**16** For as thou hast drunk upon My holy mountain, so shall all the nations drink wine; yea, they shall drink, and they shall be brought low, and they shall be as though they had never been.

**17** But upon Mount Zion shall be salvation, and it shall be holy; and the house of Jacob shall inherit those who had dispossessed them.

**18** And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame; but the house of Esau [shall be] for stubble. And they [the house of Esau] shall be kindled by them [the houses of Jacob and Joseph], and they [the houses of Jacob and Joseph] shall consume them [the house of Esau]. And there shall be no survivor in the house of Esau; for the Lord hath spoken [it].

**19** And they that dwell in the Negev shall inherit the mount of Esau; and they that dwell in the Shephelah, the Philistines; and they shall inherit the mount of Ephraim, and the plain of Samaria, and Benjamin, and Gilead.

**20** And this [shall be] the first portion of the captivity for the children of Israel: even that [which is found among] the Canaanites, unto Sarepta; and the captivity of Jerusalem, [which is found] unto Sepharath. And they shall inherit the cities of the Negev.

**21** And saviours shall come up from Mount Zion, to judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be the Lord's.
