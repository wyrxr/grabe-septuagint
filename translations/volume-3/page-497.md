ΚΕΦ. Ε΄. ΔΑΝΙΗΛ. 1435
Ἱερουσαλὴμ, καὶ ἔπινον ἐν αὐτοῖς ὁ βασιλεὺς, καὶ οἱ μεγιστᾶ- 4
νες αὐτοῦ, καὶ παράκοιτοι αὐτοῦ, καὶ αἱ παλλακαὶ αὐτοῦ· ἔπι-
νον οἶνον, καὶ ᾔνεσαν τοὺς θεοὺς τοὺς χρυσοῦς, καὶ ἀργυροῦς,
καὶ χαλκοῦς, καὶ σιδηροῦς, καὶ ξυλίνους, καὶ λιθίνους· καὶ τὸν
Θεὸν τοῦ αἰῶνος οὐκ ηὐλογήσαντο, ἔχοντα ἐξουσίαν τοῦ πνεύμα-
τος αὐτῶν. Ἐν αὐτῇ τῇ ὥρᾳ ἐξῆλθον δάκτυλοι χειρὸς ἀνθρώ- 5
που, καὶ ἔγραφον κατέναντι τῆς λαμπάδος ἐπὶ τὸ κονίαμα τοῦ
τοίχου τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐθεώρει τοὺς ἀ-
στραγάλους τῆς χειρὸς τῆς γραφούσης. Τότε τοῦ βασιλέως ἡ 6
μορφὴ ἠλλοιώθη, καὶ οἱ διαλογισμοὶ αὐτοῦ συνετάρασσον αὐτὸν,
καὶ οἱ σύνδεσμοι τῆς ὀσφύος αὐτοῦ διελύοντο, καὶ τὰ γόνατα
αὐτοῦ συνεκροτοῦντο. Καὶ ἐβόησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐν ἰσχύϊ, τοῦ εἰ- 7
σαγαγεῖν μάγους, χαλδαίους, γαζαρηνοὺς· καὶ εἶπε τοῖς σοφοῖς
Βαβυλῶνος, ὃς ἐὰν ἀναγνῷ τὴν γραφὴν ταύτην, καὶ τὴν σύγκρι-
σιν αὐτῆς γνωρίσῃ μοι, πορφύραν ἐνδύσεται, καὶ ὁ μανιάκης ὁ
χρυσοῦς (ἔσται) ἐπὶ τὸν τράχηλον αὐτοῦ, καὶ τρίτος ἐν τῇ βα-
σιλείᾳ μου ἄρξει. Καὶ εἰσεπορεύοντο πάντες οἱ σοφοὶ τοῦ βασι- 8
λέως, καὶ οὐκ ἠδύναντο τὴν γραφὴν ἀναγνῶναι, οὐδὲ τὴν σύγ-
κρισιν γνωρίσαι τῷ βασιλεῖ. Καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς Βαλτάσαρ πολὺ 9
ἐταράχθη, καὶ ἡ μορφὴ αὐτοῦ ἠλλοιώθη ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ, καὶ οἱ με-
γιστᾶνες αὐτοῦ συνεταράσσοντο. Καὶ εἰσῆλθεν ἡ βασίλισσα κα- 10
τέναντι τῶν λόγων τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ τῶν μεγιστάνων αὐτοῦ εἰς
τὸν οἶκον τοῦ πότου, καὶ ἀπεκρίθη ἡ βασίλισσα, καὶ εἶπε· Βα-
σιλεῦ, εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας ζῆθι· μὴ ταρασσέτωσάν σε οἱ διαλογισμοί
σου, καὶ ἡ μορφή σου μὴ ἀλλοιούσθω. Ἔστιν ἀνὴρ ἐν τῇ βασι- 11
λείᾳ σου, ἐν ᾧ πνεῦμα Θεοῦ ἅγιον· καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις τοῦ πα-
τρός σου, γρηγόρησις καὶ σύνεσις εὑρέθη ἐν αὐτῷ, καὶ ὁ βασι-
λεὺς Ναβουχοδονόσορ ὁ πατήρ σου ἄρχοντα ἐπαοιδῶν, μάγων, Χαλ-
δαίων, γαζαρηνῶν κατέστησεν αὐτὸν ὁ πατήρ σου ὁ βασιλεύς.
Ὅτι πνεῦμα περισσὸν ἐν αὐτῷ, καὶ φρόνησις καὶ σύνεσις ἐν αὐ- 12
τῷ, συγκρίνων ἐνύπνια, καὶ ἀναγγέλλων κρατούμενα, καὶ λύων
συνδέσμους, Δανιήλ· καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐπέθηκεν αὐτῷ ὄνομα, Βαλ-
τάσαρ· νῦν οὖν κληθήτω, καὶ τὴν σύγκρισιν αὐτοῦ ἀναγγελεῖ
σοι. Τότε Δανιὴλ εἰσήχθη ἐνώπιον τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ εἶπεν ὁ 13
βασιλεὺς τῷ Δανιήλ· σὺ εἶ Δανιήλ, ὁ ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν τῆς αἰχμα-
λωσίας τῆς Ἰουδαίας, ἧς ἤγαγεν ὁ βασιλεὺς ὁ πατήρ μου;

**Chapter V.**

**3** Jerusalem. And the King, and his lords, and his royal consorts, and his concubines drank therein; they drank wine, and they praised the gods of gold, and of silver, and of bronze, and of iron, and of wood, and of stone; but they blessed not the God of eternity, who holdeth dominion over their spirit.

**5** At that same hour came forth the fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the candelabrum upon the plaster of the wall of the king's palace; and the King beheld the finger-joints of the hand that wrote.

**6** Then was the king's countenance changed, and his thoughts troubled him; and the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.

**7** And the King cried aloud with might, to bring in the magicians, the Chaldeans, and the Gazarenes. And the King spake unto the wise men of Babylon, saying, "Whosoever shall read this writing, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof, he shall be clothed with purple, and a golden chain shall be about his neck, and he shall rule as the third in my kingdom."

**8** Then came in all the king's wise men; but they could not read the writing, nor make known unto the King the interpretation thereof.

**9** Then was King Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed yet again upon him; and his lords were sore perplexed.

**10** Now the queen, by reason of the words of the King and his lords, came into the banquet house. And the queen spake and said, "O King, live forever! Let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed.

**11** There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy God; and in the days of thy father, watchfulness and understanding were found in him. And King Nebuchadnezzar thy father — thy father the King — made him master of the enchanters, the magicians, the Chaldeans, and the Gazarenes.

**12** Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding are in him, interpreting dreams, and showing hard sentences, and dissolving doubts, even Daniel; to whom the King gave the name Belshazzar. Now therefore let him be called, and he will show thee the interpretation thereof."

**13** Then was Daniel brought in before the King. And the King spake and said unto Daniel, "Art thou that Daniel, who art of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the King my father brought hither?"
