ὅρμων σου κύκλῳ, οὗτοι ἐτελείωσάν σου τὸ κάλλος. Καρχηδόνιοι 12
ἔμποροί σου ἀπὸ πλήθους πάσης ἰσχύος σου, ἀργύριον καὶ χρυ-
σῖον καὶ χαλκὸν καὶ σίδηρον καὶ κασσίτερον καὶ μόλιβδον ἔδω-

νοντα, αὐτοὶ ἐνεμπορεύονταί σοι ἐν ψυχαῖς ἀνθρώπων, καὶ σκεύη
χαλκᾶ ἔδωκαν τὴν ἐμπορίαν σου, ἐξ οἴκου Θογαρμᾶ ἵππους καὶ 14
ἵππεῖς καὶ ἡμιόνους ἔδωκαν ἀγοράν σου. Υἱοὶ Ῥοδίων ἔμποροί 15
σου, ἀπὸ νήσων ἐπλήθυναν τὴν ἐμπορίαν σου ἐδόντας ἐλεφαντί-

πους ἐμπορίας σου ἀπὸ πλήθους τοῦ συμμίκτου σου, στακτὴν καὶ
ποικίλματα ἐκ Θαρσεῖς, καὶ Ῥαχμᾶ, καὶ Κορχὼρ ἔδωκαν τὴν

πράσει καὶ μύρων καὶ κασίας, καὶ πρώτων μέλι καὶ ἔλαιον καὶ ῥη-
τίνην ἔδωκαν εἰς τὸν σύμμικτόν σου. Δαμασκὸς ἔμποροί σου ἐν 18
πλήθει ἔργων σου, ἐκ πλήθους πάσης δυνάμεώς σου· οἶνον ἐκ Χελ-
βὼν, καὶ ἔρια ἐκ Μιλήτου, καὶ οἶνον εἰς τὴν ἀγοράν σου ἔδω-

Κηδὰρ, οὗτοι ἔμποροί σου διὰ χειρός σου, καμήλους καὶ ἀμνοὺς
καὶ κριοὺς, καὶ μόσχους ἐν οἷς ἐνεμπορεύονταί σοι. Ἔμποροι Σαβά, 22

τοῦ νότου συνέτριψέ σε ἐν καρδίᾳ θαλάσσης, ἦσαν δυνάμεις σου, 27
καὶ ὁ μισθός σου, ἐκ τῶν συμμίκτων σου, οἱ κωπηλάται σου, καὶ
οἱ κυβερνῆταί σου, καὶ οἱ σύμβουλοί σου, καὶ οἱ σύμμικτοί σου οἱ
τῶν συμμίκτων σου, καὶ πάντες οἱ ἄνδρες οἱ πολεμισταί σου οἱ

thy rowers, and thy shipmasters, and thy counselors,
and thy mingled ones, even those of thy mingled ones,
and all thy men of war that were in thee;
and all thy congregation in the midst of thee shall fall in the heart</p>
