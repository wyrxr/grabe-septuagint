**3** ὁ μεγαλοπτέρυγος, ὁ μακρὸς τῇ ἐκτάσει, πλήρης ὀνύχων, ὃς ἔχει
τὸ ἄγημα εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὸν Λίβανον, καὶ ἔλαβε τὰ ἐκλεκτὰ τῆς
**4** κέδρου, τὰ ἄκρα τῆς ἀπαλότητος ἀπέκνισε, καὶ ἤνεγκεν αὐτὰ
εἰς γῆν Χαναὰν, εἰς πόλιν τετειχισμένην ἔθετο αὐτά.
**5** Καὶ ἔλαβεν ἀπὸ τοῦ σπέρματος τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὸ εἰς τὸ πεδίον
φυτὸν ἐφ᾿ ὕδατι πολλῷ, ἐπιβλεπόμενον ἔταξεν αὐτό.
**6** Καὶ ἀνέτελε καὶ ἐγένετο εἰς ἄμπελον εὐθηνοῦσαν καὶ μικρὰν τῷ μεγέ-
θει, τοῦ ἐπιφαίνεσθαι αὐτῇ τὰ κλήματα αὐτῆς ἐπ᾿ αὐτήν· καὶ
αἱ ῥίζαι αὐτῆς ὑποκάτω αὐτῆς ἦσαν· καὶ ἐγένετο εἰς ἄμπελον
μεγάλην, καὶ ἐποίησεν ἀπώρυγας, καὶ ἐξέτεινε τὴν ἀναδενδράδα
αὐτῆς.
**7** Καὶ ἐγένετο ἀετὸς ἕτερος μέγας, μεγαλοπτέρυγος, πο-
λὺς ὄνυξι· καὶ ἰδοὺ ἡ ἄμπελος αὕτη περιπεπλεγμένη πρὸς αὐτὸν,
καὶ αἱ ῥίζαι αὐτῆς πρὸς αὐτὸν, καὶ τὰ κλήματα αὐτῆς (καὶ) ἐ-
ξαπέστειλεν αὐτῷ, τοῦ ποτίσαι αὐτὴν σὺν τῷ βώλῳ τῆς φυτείας
αὐτῆς.
**8** Εἰς πεδίον καλὸν ἐφ᾿ ὕδατι πολλῷ αὕτη πιαίνεται, τοῦ
ποιῆσαι βλαστὸν, καὶ ἐνέγκαι καρπὸν, τοῦ εἶναι εἰς ἄμπελον με-
γάλην.
**9** Διὰ τοῦτο εἰπὸν· τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναΐ Κύριος· εἰ κατευθυ-
νεῖ, οὐχὶ αἱ ῥίζαι τῆς ἀπαλότητος αὐτῆς καὶ ὁ καρπὸς σαπήσε-
ται; καὶ ξηρανθήσεται πάντα τὰ προανατέλλοντα αὐτῆς, καὶ οὐκ
ἐν βραχίονι μεγάλῳ, οὐδὲ ἐν λαῷ πολλῷ τοῦ ἐκσπάσαι αὐτὴν ἐκ
ῥιζῶν αὐτῆς.
**10** Καὶ ἰδοὺ πιαίνεται· μὴ κατευθυνεῖ; οὐχὶ ἅμα τῷ
ἀφᾶσθαι αὐτῆς ἄνεμον τὸν καύσωνα ξηρανθήσεται ξηρασία; σὺν
τῷ βώλῳ ἀνατολῆς αὐτῆς ξηρανθήσεται.
**11** Καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυ-
ρίου πρὸς με, λέγων·
**12** υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, εἰπὸν δὴ πρὸς τὸν οἶκον Ἰσρα-
ὴλ τὸν παραπικραίνοντα· οὐκ ἐπίστασθε τί ἐστι ταῦτα; εἰπὸν·
ὅταν ἔλθῃ βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ, καὶ λήψεται τὸν
βασιλέα αὐτῆς, καὶ τοὺς ἄρχοντας αὐτῆς, καὶ ἄξει αὐτοὺς πρὸς
αὐτὸν εἰς Βαβυλῶνα.
**13** Καὶ λήψεται ἐκ τοῦ σπέρματος τῆς βασι-
λείας, καὶ διαθήσεται πρὸς αὐτὸν διαθήκην, καὶ εἰσάξει αὐτὸν ἐν
ἀρᾷ, καὶ τοὺς ἡγουμένους τῆς γῆς λήψεται,
**14** τοῦ γενέσθαι εἰς βα-
σιλείαν ἀσθενῆ, τὸ καθόλου μὴ ἐπαίρεσθαι, τοῦ φυλάσσειν τὴν
διαθήκην αὐτοῦ, τοῦ ἱστάνειν αὐτήν.
**15** Καὶ ἀποστήσεται ἀπ᾿ αὐ-
τοῦ, τοῦ ἐξαποστέλλειν ἀγγέλους ἑαυτοῦ εἰς Αἴγυπτον, τοῦ δοῦ-
ναι αὐτῷ ἵππους καὶ λαὸν πολὺν· εἰ κατευθυνεῖ, εἰ διασωθήσεται
ὁ ποιῶν ἐναντία; καὶ παραβαίνων διαθήκην εἰ διασωθήσεται;
**16** Διὰ τοῦτο ζῶ ἐγὼ, λέγει Ἀδωναΐ Κύριος, ἐὰν μὴ ἐν τῷ τόπῳ,

**3** [He who is] great-winged, long in his expanse, full of claws, who hath the majesty to enter into Lebanon, and took the choicest of the cedar, even the top of its tender shoots did he pluck off, and brought them
**4** unto the land of Canaan, [and] set them in a walled city.
**5** And he took of the seed of the land, and placed it in the plain as a plant by many waters; he established it to be looked upon.
**6** And it sprang up and became a prosperous vine, small in stature, so that its branches did appear upon it; and its roots were beneath it. And it became a great vine, and made channels, and stretched forth its climbing shoots.
**7** And there came to be another great eagle, great-winged, many in claws; and behold, this vine was entwined toward him, and its roots toward him, and its branches it did send forth unto him, that he might water it with the clod of its planting.
**8** In a good plain by many waters, this [vine] doth thrive, to put forth a shoot, and to bear fruit, that it might become a great vine.
**9** Therefore say thou: Thus saith Adonai the Lord: Shall it prosper? Shall not the roots of its tender growth and its fruit decay? And all its shoots which sprang forth shall be dried up, and not by a great arm, nor by a great people to pluck it up from its roots.
**10** And behold, it doth thrive: shall it prosper? Shall it not, as soon as the scorching wind toucheth it, be dried up by drought? Together with the clod of its springing forth, it shall be dried up.
**11** Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying:
**12** Son of man, speak now unto the house of Israel which doth sorely provoke [Me]: know ye not what these things are? Say thou: When the king of Babylon shall come unto Jerusalem, and shall take her king, and her princes, and bring them unto him in Babylon,
**13** and shall take of the seed of the kingdom, and shall make a covenant with him, and bring him under an oath, and shall take the leaders of the land,
**14** that it might be a weak kingdom, which should not lift itself up at all, but should keep his covenant, that it might be established.
**15** But he shall rebel from him, sending his messengers unto Egypt, to give him horses and a great people. Shall he prosper? Shall he be saved that doeth these contrary things? And shall he be saved that transgresseth a covenant?
**16** Therefore, as I live, saith Adonai the Lord, surely not in the place
