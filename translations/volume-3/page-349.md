σβύτερος. Καὶ ἔγνων ὅτι λόγος Κυρίου ἐστί, καὶ ἐκτησάμην 9
τὸν ἀγρὸν Ἀναμεὴλ υἱοῦ ἀδελφοῦ πατρός μου, τὸν ἐν Ἀναθώθ,
καὶ ἔστησα αὐτῷ ἀργύριον ἑπτὰ σίκλους, καὶ δέκα ἀργυρίου, καὶ 10
ἔγραψα εἰς βιβλίον, καὶ διεσφραγισάμην, καὶ διεμαρτυράμην μάρ-
τυρας, καὶ ἔστησα τὸ ἀργύριον ἐν ζυγῷ. Καὶ ἔλαβον τὸ βιβλίον 11
τῆς κτήσεως τὸ ἐσφραγισμένον τὴν ἐντολὴν καὶ τὰ δικαιώ-
ματα, καὶ τὸ ἀνεγνωσμένον· καὶ ἔδωκα τὸ βιβλίον τῆς κτήσεως 12
τῷ Βαροὺχ υἱῷ Νηρίου υἱοῦ Μαασαίου, κατ᾿ ὀφθαλμοὺς Ἀναμεὴλ
υἱοῦ ἀδελφοῦ πατρός μου, καὶ κατ᾿ ὀφθαλμοὺς τῶν ἑστηκότων
καὶ γραφόντων ἐν τῷ βιβλίῳ τῆς κτήσεως, καὶ κατ᾿ ὀφθαλμοὺς
τῶν Ἰουδαίων πάντων, τῶν καθημένων ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ τῆς φυλακῆς.
Καὶ συνέταξα τῷ Βαροὺχ κατ᾿ ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτῶν, λέγων. Οὕτως 13.14
εἶπε Κύριος παντοκράτωρ ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ· λάβε τὸ βιβλίον
τῆς κτήσεως τοῦτο τὸ ἐσφραγισμένον, καὶ τὸ βιβλίον τὸ ἀνεγνω-
σμένον τοῦτο, καὶ θήσεις αὐτὸ εἰς ἀγγεῖον ὀστράκινον, ἵνα δια-
μείνῃ ἡμέρας πλείους. Ὅτι οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος παντοκράτωρ ὁ 15
Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ· ἔτι κτηθήσονται ἀγροί, καὶ οἰκίαι, καὶ ἀμπελῶ-
νες ἐν τῇ γῇ ταύτῃ. Καὶ προσηυξάμην πρὸς Κύριον μετὰ τὸ 16
δοῦναί με τὸ βιβλίον τῆς κτήσεως πρὸς Βαροὺχ υἱὸν Νηρίου,
λέγων. Ὦ ὢν Κύριε Κύριε, σὺ ἐποίησας τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ τὴν 17
γῆν ἐν τῇ ἰσχύϊ σου τῇ μεγάλῃ, καὶ τῷ βραχίονί σου τῷ ὑψηλῷ
καὶ τῷ μετεώρῳ, οὐ μὴ ἀποκρυβῇ ἀπὸ σοῦ οὐδὲν ῥῆμα, ποιῶν 18
ἔλεος εἰς χιλιάδας, καὶ ἀποδιδοὺς ἁμαρτίας πατέρων εἰς κόλ-
πους τέκνων αὐτῶν μετ᾿ αὐτοὺς· ὁ Θεὸς ὁ μέγας ὁ ἰσχυρός,
Κύριος μεγάλης βουλῆς, καὶ ὁ δυνατὸς τοῖς ἔργοις, ὁ Θεὸς ὁ 19
μέγας ὁ παντοκράτωρ, καὶ μεγαλώνυμος Κύριος· οἱ ὀφθαλμοί σου
ἀνεῳγμένοι εἰς πάσας τὰς ὁδοὺς τῶν υἱῶν τῶν ἀνθρώπων, ἀπο-
δοῦναι ἑκάστῳ κατὰ τὴν ὁδὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ κατὰ τοὺς καρποὺς τῶν 20
ἐπιτηδευμάτων αὐτοῦ· ὃς ἐποίησας σημεῖα καὶ τέρατα ἐν γῇ Αἰ-
γύπτῳ ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης, καὶ ἐν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐν τοῖς γη-
γενέσιν· καὶ ἐποίησας σεαυτῷ ὄνομα, ὡς ἡ ἡμέρα αὕτη, καὶ ἐξή- 21
γαγες τὸν λαόν σου Ἰσραὴλ ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου ἐν σημείοις, καὶ
ἐν τέρασι, καὶ ἐν χειρὶ κραταιᾷ, καὶ ἐν βραχίονι ὑψηλῷ, καὶ ἐν 22
δράμασι μεγάλοις, καὶ ἔδωκας αὐτοῖς τὴν γῆν ταύτην, ἣν ὤμο-
σας τοῖς πατράσιν αὐτῶν, δοῦναι αὐτοῖς, γῆν ῥέουσαν γάλα καὶ
μέλι. Καὶ εἰσῆλθοσαν καὶ ἔλαβον αὐτήν, καὶ οὐκ ἤκουσαν τῆς 23

**JEREMIAH CHAPTER 32 [LXX] (Hebrew Chapter 32)**

**8** ...and thine is the right of redemption, and thou art the elder [kinsman].
**9** And I knew that it was the word of the Lord; and I bought the field of Hanameel, the son of my father's brother, that is in Anathoth;
**10** and I weighed him the silver, [even] seven shekels and ten [pieces] of silver; and I wrote [it] in a scroll, and sealed it, and called forth witnesses, and weighed the silver in a balance.
**11** And I took the scroll of the purchase, the sealed [deed], [which containeth] the terms and the ordinances, and the unsealed [deed];
**12** and I gave the scroll of the purchase unto Baruch, the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, before the eyes of Hanameel, my father's brother's son, and before the eyes of them that stood and wrote in the scroll of the purchase, and before the eyes of all the Jews who sat in the court of the guard.
**13** And I charged Baruch before their eyes, saying,
**14** "Thus saith the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel: Take this scroll of the purchase, the sealed one, and this scroll, the unsealed one, and thou shalt put them into an earthenware vessel, that they may remain many days."
**15** For thus saith the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel: "Yet shall fields, and houses, and vineyards be purchased in this land."
**16** And I prayed unto the Lord after I had given the scroll of the purchase unto Baruch, the son of Neriah, saying,
**17** "Ah, Thou Who Art, Lord, O Lord! Thou hast made the heaven and the earth by Thy great might, and by Thy high and uplifted arm; there is nothing hidden from Thee, not a single word;
**18** Who showest mercy unto thousands, and recompensing the iniquities of the fathers into the bosoms of their children after them; O God, the great, the mighty,
**19** O Lord of great counsel, and mighty in works, O God, the great, the Almighty, and whose name is great, O Lord; Thine eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men,
**20** to give unto each according to his way, and according to the fruits of his endeavors; Who hast wrought signs and wonders in the land of Egypt even unto this day, and in Israel, and among the inhabitants of the land;
**21** and Thou hast made for Thyself a name, as [it is] this day, and Thou hast brought forth Thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and
**22** with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a high arm, and with great deeds; and hast given them this land, which Thou didst swear unto their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey.
**23** And they entered and took it, yet they heard not Thy voice, nor walked they in Thy commandments;
