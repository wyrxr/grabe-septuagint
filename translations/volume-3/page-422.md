αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν γῆν, ἣν ἔδωκα αὐτοῖς, γῆν ῥέουσαν γάλα καὶ μέλι,
16 κηρίου ἐστὶ παρὰ πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν. Ἀνθ’ ὧν τὰ δικαιώματά μου
ἀπώσαντο, καὶ ἐν τοῖς προστάγμασί μου οὐκ ἐπορεύθησαν ἐν αὐ-
τοῖς, καὶ τὰ σάββατά μου ἐβεβήλουν, καὶ ὀπίσω τῶν ἐνθυμημά-
17 των καρδίας αὐτῶν ἐπορεύοντο, καὶ ἐφείσατο ὁ ὀφθαλμός μου ἐπ’
αὐτοὺς, τοῦ ἐξαλεῖψαι αὐτοὺς, καὶ οὐκ ἐποίησα αὐτοὺς εἰς συντέ-
18 λειαν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ. Καὶ εἶπα πρὸς τὰ τέκνα αὐτῶν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ·
ἐν τοῖς νομίμοις τῶν πατέρων ὑμῶν μὴ πορεύεσθε, καὶ τὰ δικαι-
ώματα αὐτῶν μὴ φυλάσσεσθε, καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἐπιτηδεύμασιν αὐτῶν
19 μὴ συναναμίγνυσθε, καὶ μὴ μιαίνεσθε. Ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν·
ἐν τοῖς προστάγμασί μου πορεύεσθε, καὶ τὰ δικαιώματά μου φυ-
20 λάσσεσθε, καὶ ποιεῖτε αὐτά. Καὶ τὰ σάββατά μου ἁγιάζετε, καὶ
ἔστω εἰς σημεῖον ἀναμέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ ἀναμέσον ὑμῶν, τοῦ γινώ-
21 σκειν ὑμᾶς, ὅτι ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν. Καὶ παρεπίκραναν με,
καὶ τὰ τέκνα αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐν τοῖς προστάγμασί μου οὐκ ἐπορεύ-
θησαν, καὶ τὰ δικαιώματά μου οὐκ ἐφυλάξαντο τοῦ ποιεῖν αὐτὰ,
ἃ ποιήσει αὐτὰ ἄνθρωπος, καὶ ζήσεται ἐν αὐτοῖς, καὶ τὰ σάβ-
βατά μου ἐβεβήλουν· καὶ εἶπα τοῦ ἐκχέαι τὸν θυμόν μου ἐπ’ αὐ-
22 τοὺς ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, τοῦ συντελέσαι τὴν ὀργήν μου ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς. Καὶ
ἐπέστρεψα τὴν χεῖρά μου, καὶ (οὐκ) ἐποίησα, ὅπως τὸ ὄνομά μου
τὸ παράπαν μὴ βεβηλωθῇ ἐνώπιον τῶν ἐθνῶν, ὧν ἐξήγαγον αὐ-
23 τοὺς κατ’ ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐξῆρα τὴν χεῖρά μου ἐπ’ αὐ-
τοὺς ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, τοῦ διασκορπίσαι αὐτοὺς ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι, καὶ
24 τοῦ διασπεῖραι αὐτοὺς ἐν ταῖς χώραις, ἀνθ’ ὧν τὰ δικαιώματά
μου οὐκ ἐποίησαν, καὶ τὰ προστάγματά μου ἀπώσαντο, καὶ τὰ
σάββατά μου ἐβεβήλουν, καὶ ὀπίσω τῶν ἐνθυμημάτων τῶν πατέρων
25 αὐτῶν ἦσαν οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐγὼ ἔδωκα αὐτοῖς προστάγ-
26 ματα οὐ καλά, καὶ δικαιώματα ἐν οἷς οὐ ζήσονται ἐν αὐτοῖς. Καὶ
μιανῶ αὐτοὺς ἐν τοῖς δόμασιν αὐτῶν, ἐν τῷ διαπορεύεσθαι με πᾶν
διανοῖγον μήτραν, ὅπως ἀφανίσω αὐτοὺς ἵνα γνῶσιν· ὅτι ἐγὼ Κύ-
27 ριος. Διὰ τοῦτο λάλησον πρὸς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ, υἱὲ ἀνθρώ-
που· καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτοὺς· τάδε λέγει Ἄδωναι Κύριος· ἕως τού-
του παρώργισάν με οἱ πατέρες ὑμῶν ἐν τοῖς παραπτώμασιν αὐτῶν,
28 ἐν οἷς παρέπεσαν εἰς ἐμέ. Καὶ εἰσήγαγον αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν γῆν, εἰς ἣν
ἦρα τὴν χεῖρά μου τοῦ δοῦναι αὐτὴν αὐτοῖς· καὶ εἶδον πάντα
βουνὸν ὑψηλὸν καὶ πᾶν ξύλον κατάσκιον, καὶ ἔθυσαν ἐκεῖ τοῖς

### Chapter 20

**15** ...[them] into the land which I gave them, a land flowing with milk and honey,
**16** a honeycomb it is, beyond all the land. Forasmuch as they rejected My judgments, and walked not in My statutes in them, and profaned My Sabbaths, and went after the thoughts of their own heart.
**17** Then My eye spared them, to blot them out, and I did not bring them to an end in the wilderness.
**18** And I said unto their children in the wilderness, "Walk not in the ordinances of your fathers, neither keep ye their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their practices.
**19** Be not mingled [with them], neither be defiled. I am the Lord your God; walk in My statutes, and keep My judgments,
**20** and do them. And hallow My Sabbaths; and let them be a sign between Me and between you, that ye may know
**21** that I am the Lord your God." But the children also provoked Me; and in My statutes they walked not, neither kept they My judgments to do them, which if a man do, he shall live by them; and My Sabbaths they profaned. Then I said that I would pour out My fury upon them
**22** in the wilderness, to accomplish My wrath upon them. But I withdrew My hand, and did not act, that My Name should not altogether be profaned before the nations, before whose eyes I had brought them forth.
**23** And I lifted up My hand against them in the wilderness, to scatter them among the nations,
**24** and to disperse them throughout the lands; because My judgments they had not done, and My statutes they had rejected, and My Sabbaths they had profaned, and after the thoughts of their fathers
**25** their eyes were. And I also gave them statutes that were not good, and judgments by which they should not live.
**26** And I shall defile them by their gifts, when I cause every firstborn to pass through [the fire], that I might destroy them, so that they may know that I am the Lord.
**27** Wherefore speak unto the house of Israel, O son of man, and thou shalt say unto them, "Thus saith Adonai the Lord: Even until this point have your fathers provoked Me with their transgressions,
**28** wherein they fell away from Me. For I brought them into the land, into which I had lifted up My hand to give it unto them; and they saw every high hill and every leafy tree, and there they sacrificed unto their gods."
