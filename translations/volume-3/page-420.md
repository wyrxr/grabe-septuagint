ΚΕΦ. ΙΘ΄.
2 γενήθη, καὶ ἐν μέσῳ λεόντων ἐπλήθυνε σκύμνους αὐτῆς;
3 Καὶ ἀπεπήδησεν εἷς τῶν σκύμνων αὐτῆς, λέων ἐγένετο, καὶ ἔμαθεν τοῦ
  ἁρπάζειν ἁρπάγματα, ἀνθρώπους ἔφαγε.
4 Καὶ ἤκουσαν κατ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἔθνη, ἐν τῇ διαφθορᾷ αὐτῶν συνελήφθη, καὶ ἤγαγον αὐτὸν ἐν κημῷ
5 εἰς γῆν Αἰγύπτου, καὶ ἴδεν, ὅτι ἀπῶσται ἀπ᾿ αὐτῆς, καὶ ἀπώ-
  λετο ἡ ὑπόστασις αὐτῆς· καὶ ἔλαβεν ἄλλον ἐκ τῶν σκύμνων αὐ-
6 τῆς, λέοντα ἔταξεν αὐτόν, καὶ ἀνεστρέφετο ἐν μέσῳ λεόντων,
  λέων ἐγένετο, καὶ ἔμαθεν ἁρπάζειν ἁρπάγματα· ἀνθρώπους ἔφαγε,
7 καὶ ἐνέμετο ἐν τῷ θράσει αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰς πόλεις αὐτῶν ἐξερήμωσε,
  καὶ ἠφάνισε γῆν, καὶ τὸ πλήρωμα αὐτῆς ἀπὸ φωνῆς ὠρυώματος
8 αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔδωκαν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν ἔθνη ἀπὸ χωρῶν κυκλόθεν, καὶ
  ἐξεπέτασαν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν τὰ δίκτυα αὐτῶν, ἐν διαφθορᾷ αὐτῶν καὶ
9 συνελήφθη, καὶ ἔθεντο αὐτὸν ἐν κημῷ, καὶ ἤνεγκαν αὐτὸν ἐν γα-
  λαγρᾷ πρὸς βασιλέα Βαβυλῶνος, καὶ εἰσήγαγον αὐτὸν εἰς φυ-
10 λακήν, ὅπως μὴ ἀκουσθῇ ἡ φωνὴ αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὰ ὄρη τοῦ Ἰσραήλ.
11 Ἡ μήτηρ σου ὡς ἄμπελος, ὡς ἄνθος ἐν ξοᾷ ἐν ὕδατι πεφυτευ-
   μένη, ὁ καρπὸς αὐτῆς καὶ ὁ βλαστὸς αὐτῆς ἐγένετο ἐξ ὕδατος
12 πολλοῦ. Καὶ ἐγένοντο αὐτῇ ῥάβδος ἰσχύος ἐπὶ φυλὴν ἡγουμένων,
   καὶ ὑψώθη ἐν τῷ μεγέθει αὐτῆς ἐν μέσῳ στελεχέων· καὶ ἴδε τὸ
13 μέγεθος αὐτῆς ἐν πλήθει κλημάτων αὐτῆς, καὶ κατεκλάσθη ἐν
   θυμῷ, ἐπὶ γῆν ἔρημον, καὶ ἄνεμος ὁ καύσων ἐξήρανε τὰ ἐκλεκτὰ
14 αὐτῆς· ἐξεδικήθησαν καὶ ἐξηράνθη ἡ ῥάβδος ἰσχύος αὐτῆς· πῦρ
   ἀνήλωσεν αὐτήν, καὶ νῦν ἐφύτευσαν αὐτὴν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, ἐν γῇ
15 ἀνύδρῳ. Καὶ ἐξῆλθε πῦρ ἐκ ῥάβδου ἐκλεκτῶν αὐτῆς, καὶ κατέ-
   φαγεν αὐτήν, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἐν αὐτῇ ῥάβδος ἰσχύος αὐτῆς, φυλὴ εἰς
16 παραβολὴν θρήνου ἐστί, καὶ ἔσται εἰς θρῆνον.

ΚΕΦ. Κ΄.
1 ΚΑὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἔτει τῷ ἑβδόμῳ ἐν τῷ πέμπτῳ μηνί, τῇ δε-
  κάτῃ τοῦ μηνός, ἦλθον ἄνδρες ἐκ τῶν πρεσβυτέρων τοῦ οἴκου
  Ἰσραήλ, ἐπερωτῆσαι τὸν Κύριον, καὶ ἐκάθισαν πρὸ προσώπου μου.
2 Καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς μέ, λέγων· υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, λά-
3 λησον πρὸς τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους τοῦ οἴκου Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς
  αὐτούς· τάδε λέγει Ἄδωναΐ Κύριος· εἰ ἐπερωτῆσαί με ὑμεῖς ἔρ-
4 χεσθε; ζῶ ἐγώ, εἰ ἀποκριθήσομαι ὑμῖν, λέγει Ἄδωναΐ Κύριος.

### Chapter 19

**2** ...Did she become, and in the midst of lions did she multiply her whelps?
**3** And one of her whelps did leap forth; a lion he became, and he learned to seize prey; he devoured men.
**4** And nations heard concerning him; in their ruin was he captured, and they brought him in a muzzle unto the land of Egypt.
**5** And she saw that she was cast away from him, and her hope did perish. And she took another from among her whelps;
**6** him she appointed a lion, and he roamed among lions; a lion he became, and he learned to seize prey; men he devoured,
**7** and he ravaged in his boldness, and their cities he made desolate, and he laid waste the land, and its fullness, by the sound of his roaring.
**8** And nations from round about gave [battle] against him; and they spread their nets over him, and in their ruin was he captured;
**9** and they put him in a muzzle, and they brought him in fetters unto the king of Babylon, and they led him into prison, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.
**10** Thy mother was as a vine, as a blossom upon a polished surface, planted in water; her fruit and her shoot came forth from much water.
**11** And there came unto her a rod of strength, for a tribe of rulers; and she was exalted in her greatness among the trunks [of trees]; and she saw her greatness in the multitude of her branches;
**12** but she was broken in wrath, upon a desolate land; and the scorching wind did dry up her chosen [shoots]; they were punished, and her staff of strength withered; fire consumed her.
**13** And now have they planted her in the wilderness, in a waterless land.
**14** And fire went forth from a rod of her chosen [branches], and it consumed her, and there was no rod of her strength in her. This tribe is for a lamentation, and it shall be for a lamentation.

### Chapter 20

**1** And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, that men from among the elders of the house of Israel came to enquire of the Lord, and they sat before my face.
**2** And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, "Son of man,"
**3** "Speak unto the elders of the house of Israel, and thou shalt say unto them, 'Thus saith Adonai the Lord: Is it to enquire of Me that ye come? As I live, I will not answer you,' saith Adonai the Lord."
