ΚΕΦ. ΛΕ΄. Λς΄. ΗΣΑΙΑΣ
ἀναβῇ ἐπ᾽ αὐτήν, οὐδὲ μὴ εὑρεθῇ ἐκεῖ, ἀλλὰ πορεύσονται ἐν
αὐτῇ λελυτρωμένοι·
**10** καὶ συνηγμένοι διὰ Κύριον ἀποστραφήσονται, καὶ ἥξουσιν εἰς Σιὼν μετ᾽ εὐφροσύνης, καὶ εὐφροσύνη
αἰώνιος ὑπὲρ κεφαλῆς αὐτῶν· ἐπὶ γὰρ κεφαλῆς αὐτῶν αἰνέσεις
καὶ ἀγαλλίαμα, καὶ εὐφροσύνη καταλήψεται αὐτούς, ἀπέδρα
ὀδύνη καὶ λύπη καὶ στεναγμός.

ΚΕΦ ΛΣ΄. XXXVI.

**1** ΚΑὶ ἐγένετο τοῦ τεσσαρεσκαιδεκάτου ἔτους βασιλεύοντος Ἑζεκίου, ἀνέβη Σενναχηρεὶμ βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων ἐπὶ τὰς
πόλεις τῆς Ἰουδαίας τὰς ὀχυράς, καὶ ἔλαβεν αὐτάς.
**2** Καὶ ἀπέστειλε βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων τὸν Ῥαψάκην ἐκ Λαχεὶς εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Ἑζεκίαν μετὰ δυνάμεως πολλῆς, καὶ ἔστη ἐν τῷ ὑδραγωγῷ τῆς κολυμβήθρας τῆς ἄνω ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ τοῦ
ἀγροῦ τοῦ γναφέως.
**3** Καὶ ἐξῆλθε πρὸς αὐτὸν Ἑλιακεὶμ ὁ τοῦ Χελκίου ὁ οἰκονόμος, καὶ Σομνὰς ὁ γραμματεὺς, καὶ Ἰωὰχ
ὁ τοῦ Ἀσὰφ ὁ ὑπομνηματογράφος.
**4** Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς Ῥαψάκης· εἴπατε Ἑζεκίᾳ· τάδε λέγει ὁ βασιλεὺς ὁ μέγας βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων· τί πεποιθὼς εἶ;
**5** Μὴ ἐν βουλῇ ἢ ἐν λόγοις χειλέων παράταξις γίνεται; καὶ νῦν ἐπὶ τίνι πέποιθας, ὅτι ἀπειθεῖς μοι;
**6** Ἰδοὺ πεποιθὼς εἶ ἐπὶ τὴν ῥάβδον τὴν καλαμίνην τὴν τεθλασμένην ταύτην, ἐπ᾽ Αἴγυπτον· ὃς ἂν ἐπιστηριχθῇ ἀνὴρ ἐπ᾽ αὐτήν, εἰσελεύσεται εἰς τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ, καὶ τρήσει αὐτήν· οὕτως
ἐστι Φαραὼ βασιλεὺς Αἰγύπτου, καὶ πάντες οἱ πεποιθότες ἐπ᾽
αὐτῷ.
**7** Εἰ δὲ λέγεται πρὸς μέ· ἐπὶ Κύριον τὸν Θεὸν ἡμῶν πεποίθαμεν, καὶ μὴν οὗτός ἐστιν, οὗ περιεῖλεν Ἑζεκίας τὰ ὑψηλὰ
αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπε τῷ Ἰούδα καὶ τῇ Ἱερουσαλήμ· κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου τούτου προσκυνεῖτε.
**8** Καὶ νῦν μίχθητε δὴ τῷ Κυρίῳ μου τῷ βασιλεῖ Ἀσσυρίων, καὶ δώσω ὑμῖν δισχιλίας ἵππον, εἰ δυνήσεσθε δοῦναι ἀναβάτας ἰδίους ἐπ᾽ αὐτούς.
**9** Καὶ πῶς δύνασθε ἀποστρέψαι τὸ πρόσωπον τοπάρχου ἑνὸς τῶν δούλων τοῦ Κυρίου μου τῶν μικρῶν; οἰκέται εἰσὶν, οἱ πεποιθότες ἐπ᾽ Αἰγυπτίοις, εἰς ἵππον καὶ ἀναβάτην.
**10** Καὶ νῦν μὴ ἄνευ Κυρίου ἀνέβημεν ἐπὶ τὴν χώραν ταύτην, πολεμῆσαι αὐτήν; Κύριος εἶπε πρὸς μέ· ἀνάβηθι ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ταύτην, καὶ διάφθειρον αὐτήν.

**Chapter 35**
**9** ...shall not go up thereon, nor shall it be found there; but the redeemed shall walk therein.
**10** And they that are gathered through the Lord shall return, and shall come unto Zion with joy, and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads. For upon their heads shall be praises and exultation, and joy shall overtake them; pain and sorrow and groaning shall flee away.

**Chapter 36**
**1** Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of the reign of Hezekiah, that Sennacherib king of the Assyrians went up against all the fortified cities of Judea, and took them.
**2** And the king of the Assyrians sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem, unto king Hezekiah, with a great force; and he stood by the conduit of the upper pool, in the highway of the fuller's field.
**3** And there came forth to him Eliakim the son of Hilkiah the steward, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.
**4** And Rabshakeh said unto them, "Say to Hezekiah: Thus saith the great king, the king of the Assyrians: 'Wherein hast thou put thy trust?
**5** Doth counsel or [mere] words of lips form a battle array? And now, wherein dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?
**6** Behold, thou dost trust in this broken staff of reed, even upon Egypt; if a man shall lean upon it, it shall enter into his hand, and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt, and all who trust in him.
**7** But if it be said unto me, 'We have trusted in the Lord our God,' verily, He is the One Whose high places Hezekiah hath taken away, and said to Judah and Jerusalem, 'Before the face of this altar shall ye worship.'
**8** And now, join yourselves, I pray, to my Lord the king of Assyria, and I shall give you two thousand horse, if ye be able to provide riders of your own for them.
**9** And how can ye turn away the face of one governor, even of the least of my Lord's servants? They are house-servants, who trust in the Egyptians, for horse and for rider.
**10** And now, have we not come up against this land without the Lord, to make war against it? The Lord said unto me, 'Go up against this land, and destroy it.'"
