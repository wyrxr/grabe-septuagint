**10** ΓΥΝΑΙΚΑ ἀνδρείαν τίς εὑρήσει; Τιμιωτέρα δέ ἐστι λίθων
**11** πολυτελῶν ἡ τοιαύτη. Θαρσεῖ ἐπ᾽ αὐτῇ ἡ καρδία τοῦ ἀνδρὸς αὐ-
**12** τῆς· ἡ τοιαύτη (καλῶν) σκύλων οὐκ ἀπορήσει. Ἐνεργεῖ γὰρ τῷ
**13** ἀνδρὶ ἀγαθόν, καὶ οὐ κακόν πάντα τὸν βίον· μηρυσομένη ἔρια καὶ
**14** λίνον, ἐποίησεν εὔχρηστα ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτῆς. Ἐγένετο (δὲ) ὡσεὶ
**15** ναῦς ἐμπορευομένη μακρόθεν· συνάγει δὲ αὐτῆς τὸν βίον. Καὶ ἀν-
**16** ίσταται ἐκ νυκτῶν, καὶ ἔδωκε βρώματα τῷ οἴκῳ, καὶ ἔργα ταῖς
**17** θεραπαίναις, θεωρήσασα γεώργιον ἐπρίατο· ἀπὸ δὲ καρπῶν χει-
**18** ρῶν αὐτῆς κατεφύτευσε κτῆμα. Ἀναζωσαμένη ἰσχυρῶς τὴν ὀσφῦν
**19** αὐτῆς, ἤρεισε τοὺς βραχίονας αὐτῆς εἰς ἔργον. Ἐγεύσατο δὲ ὅτι
**20** καλόν ἐστι τὸ ἐργάζεσθαι, καὶ οὐκ ἀποσβέννυται ὅλην τὴν νύκτα
**21** ὁ λύχνος αὐτῆς. Τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῆς ἐκτείνει ἐπὶ τὰ συμφέροντα,
**22** τοὺς δὲ πήχεις αὐτῆς ἐρείδει εἰς ἄτρακτον. Χεῖρας δὲ αὐτῆς δι-
**23** ήνοιξε πέννητι, καρπὸν δὲ ἐξέτεινε πτωχῶ. Οὐ φροντίζῃ τῶν ἐν
**24** οἴκῳ ὁ ἀνὴρ αὐτῆς ὅταν που χιονίζῃ· πάντες γὰρ οἱ παρ᾽ αὐτῇ
**25** ἐνδιδύσκονται δίσσα· χλαίνας ἐποίησε τῷ ἀνδρὶ αὐτῆς, ἐκ δὲ βύσ-
**26** σου καὶ πορφύρας ἑαυτῇ ἐνδύματα. Περίβλεπτος δὲ γίνεται ἐν πύ-
**27** λαις ὁ ἀνὴρ αὐτῆς, ἡνίκα ἂν καθίσῃ ἐν συνεδρίῳ μετὰ τῶν πρε-
**28** σβυτέρων τῆς γῆς. Σινδόνας ἐποίησε καὶ ἀπέδοτο, περιζώματα δὲ
**29** τοῖς Χαναναίοις. Ἰσχὺν καὶ εὐπρέπειαν ἐνεδύσατο, καὶ ηὐφράν-
**30** θη ἐν ἡμέραις ἐσχάταις. Στόμα αὐτῆς διήνοιξε προσηκόντως καὶ
**31** ἐννόμως, καὶ τάξιν ἐστείλατο τῇ γλώσσῃ αὐτῆς. Στεγναὶ διατρι-
    βαὶ οἴκων αὐτῆς· σῖτα δὲ ὀκνηρά οὐκ ἔφαγε. (Στόμα δὲ αὐτῆς ἀνοί-
    γει σοφῶς καὶ νομοθέσμως, ἡ δὲ ἐλεημοσύνη αὐτῆς) ἀνέστησαν τὰ
    τέκνα αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐπλούτησαν· καὶ ὁ ἀνὴρ αὐτῆς ἤνεσεν αὐτήν.
    Πολλαὶ θυγατέρες ἐκτήσαντο πλοῦτον, πολλαὶ ἐποίησαν δύναμιν·
    σὺ δὲ ὑπέρκεισαι (καὶ ὑπερῆρας) πάσας. Ψευδεῖς ἀρέσκειαι, καὶ
    μάταιον κάλλος γυναικός· γυνὴ γὰρ εὐσεβὴς εὐλογεῖται, (φόβον δὲ
    Κυρίου αὐτὴ αἰνείτω). Δότε αὐτῇ ἀπὸ καρπῶν χειρῶν αὐτῆς, καὶ
    αἰνείσθω ἐν πύλαις ὁ ἀνὴρ αὐτῆς.

**Proverbs Chapter 31**

**10** Who shall find a virtuous woman? For such a one is more precious than costly stones.
**11** The heart of her husband doth trust in her; such a one shall not lack [good] spoils.
**12** For she worketh him good, and not evil, all the days of his life.
**13** She seeketh out wool and flax, and with her hands doth make them serviceable.
**14** And she is as a merchant ship, sailing from afar; she gathereth her living.
**15** And she riseth up while it is yet night, and giveth food to her household, and tasks unto her maidservants.
**16** Having considered a field, she buyeth it; and from the fruit of her hands she planteth a possession.
**17** She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms for work.
**18** She hath perceived that to work is good, and her lamp is not extinguished throughout the whole night.
**19** She stretcheth out her hands unto profitable things, and her forearms she doth rest upon the distaff.
**20** She hath opened her hands to the needy, and hath stretched forth her fruit to the poor.
**21** Her husband doth not care for those in the house when it doth snow; for all those that are with her are clothed in double.
**22** She hath made mantles for her husband, and for herself garments of fine linen and purple.
**23** And her husband is highly esteemed in the gates, when he sitteth in council with the elders of the land.
**24** She hath made fine linens and sold them, and girdles she hath delivered to the Canaanites.
**25** She is clothed with strength and comeliness, and she rejoiceth in the latter days.
**26** She hath opened her mouth fittingly and lawfully, and hath set order to her tongue.
**27** Her household activities are orderly; and lazy food she doth not eat.
**28** (And her mouth doth open wisely and with good counsel, and her mercy is shown.) Her children have risen up, and have become rich; and her husband hath praised her.
**29** Many daughters have obtained riches, many have shown strength; but thou hast surpassed (yea, and excelled) all of them.
**30** False are charms, and vain is the beauty of a woman; for a woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be blessed (and she herself let her praise the fear of the Lord).
**31** Give her of the fruit of her hands, and let her husband be praised in the gates.
