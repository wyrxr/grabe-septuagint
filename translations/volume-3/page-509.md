**7** ὄπτασίαν, ἀλλ’ ἡ ἔκτασις μεγάλη ἐπέπεσεν ἐπ’ αὐτούς, καὶ ἔφυγον ἐν φόβῳ.
**8** Κἀγὼ ὑπελείφθην μόνος, καὶ εἶδον τὴν ὀπτασίαν τὴν μεγάλην ταύτην, καὶ οὐχ ὑπελείφθη ἐν ἐμοὶ ἰσχύς, καὶ ἡ δόξα μου μετεστράφη εἰς διαφθοράν· καὶ οὐκ ἐκράτησα ἰσχύος.
**9** Καὶ ἤκουσα τὴν φωνὴν τῶν λόγων αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐν τῷ ἀκοῦσαί με φωνὴν ῥημάτων αὐτοῦ, ἤμην κατανενυγμένος, καὶ τὸ πρόσωπόν μου ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν.
**10** Καὶ ἰδοὺ χεὶρ ἁπτομένη μου, καὶ ἤγειρέ με ἐπὶ τὰ γόνατά μου, καὶ ταρσοὺς χειρῶν μου.
**11** Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς μέ· Δανιὴλ ἀνὴρ ἐπιθυμιῶν, σύνες ἐν τοῖς λόγοις οἷς ἐγὼ λαλῶ πρὸς σέ, καὶ στῆθι ἐπὶ τῇ στάσει σου, ὅτι νῦν ἀπεστάλην πρὸς σέ· καὶ ἐν τῷ λαλῆσαι αὐτὸν πρὸς μὲ τὸν λόγον τοῦτον, ἀνέστην ἔντρομος.
**12** Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς μέ· μὴ φοβοῦ Δανιήλ, ὅτι ἀπὸ τῆς πρώτης ἡμέρας ἧς ἔδωκας τὴν καρδίαν σου τοῦ συνεῖναι, καὶ τοῦ κακωθῆναι ἐναντίον Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ σου, ἠκούσθησαν οἱ λόγοι σου, καὶ ἐγὼ ἦλθον ἐν τοῖς λόγοις σου.
**13** Καὶ ὁ ἄρχων βασιλείας Περσῶν εἰστήκει ἐξεναντίας μου καὶ εἴκοσι καὶ μίαν ἡμέραν· καὶ ἰδοὺ Μιχαὴλ εἷς τῶν ἀρχόντων τῶν πρώτων ἦλθε βοηθῆσαί μοι, καὶ αὐτὸν κατέλιπον ἐκεῖ μετὰ τοῦ ἄρχοντος βασιλείας Περσῶν.
**14** Καὶ ἦλθον συνετίσαι σε ὅσα ἀπαντήσεται τῷ λαῷ σου ἐπ’ ἐσχάτων τῶν ἡμερῶν, ὅτι ἔτι ὅρασις εἰς ἡμέρας.
**15** Καὶ ἐν τῷ λαλῆσαι αὐτὸν μετ’ ἐμοῦ κατὰ τοὺς λόγους τούτους, ἔδωκα τὸ πρόσωπόν μου ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, καὶ κατενύγην.
**16** Καὶ ἰδοὺ ὡς ὁμοίωσις υἱοῦ ἀνθρώπου ἥψατο τῶν χειλέων μου, καὶ ἤνοιξα τὸ στόμα μου, καὶ ἐλάλησα, καὶ εἶπα πρὸς τὸν ἑστῶτα ἐναντίον μου· Κύριε, ἐν τῇ ὀπτασίᾳ σου ἐστράφη τὰ ἐντός μου ἐν ἐμοί, καὶ οὐκ ἔσχον ἰσχύν.
**17** Καὶ πῶς δυνήσεται ὁ παῖς σου, Κύριε, λαλῆσαι μετὰ τοῦ Κυρίου μου τούτου; καὶ ἐγὼ ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν οὐ στήσεται ἐν ἐμοὶ ἰσχύς, καὶ πνοὴ οὐχ ὑπελείφθη ἐν ἐμοί.
**18** Καὶ προσέθετο, καὶ ἥψατό μου ὡς ὅρασις ἀνθρώπου, καὶ ἐνίσχυσέ με,
**19** καὶ εἶπέ μοι· μὴ φοβοῦ ἀνὴρ ἐπιθυμιῶν, εἰρήνη σοι· ἀνδρίζου καὶ ἴσχυε· καὶ ἐν τῷ λαλῆσαι αὐτὸν μετ’ ἐμοῦ ἴσχυσα, καὶ εἶπα· λαλείτω ὁ Κύριός μου, ὅτι ἐνίσχυσάς με.
**20** Καὶ εἶπέ μοι· εἰ οἶδας, ἴνατι ἦλθον πρός σέ; καὶ νῦν ἐπιστρέψω τοῦ πολεμῆσαι μετὰ ἀρχοντος Περσῶν· καὶ ἐγὼ ἐξεπορευόμην, καὶ ὁ ἄρχων τῶν Ἑλλήνων ἤρχετο, ἀλλ’ ἢ ἀναγγελῶ σοι τὸ ἐντεταγμένον ἐν γραφῇ ἀληθείας.
**21** Καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν εἷς ἀντεχόμενος μετ’ ἐμοῦ ὑπὲρ τούτων ἀλλ’ ἢ (ἡμῖν) Μιχαὴλ ὁ ἄρχων ὑμῶν.

**Chapter 10.**

**7** vision, but a great trembling fell upon them, and they fled in fear.
**8** And I, Daniel, was left alone, and I saw this great vision, and no strength remained in me, and my comeliness was turned within me into corruption; neither did I retain any strength.
**9** And I heard the voice of his words; and when I heard the voice of his words, I was struck down, and my face was toward the ground.
**10** And behold, a hand touched me, and it raised me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands.
**11** And he said unto me, "O Daniel, man of desires, understand the words which I speak unto you, and stand upright; for now am I sent unto you." And when he spoke this word unto me, I stood trembling.
**12** And he said unto me, "Fear not, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart to understand, and to humble yourself before the Lord your God, your words were heard, and I have come because of your words.
**13** But the prince of the kingdom of Persia stood against me for twenty and one days; and behold, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I left him there with the prince of the kingdom of Persia.
**14** And I have come to make you understand what shall befall your people in the latter days: for the vision is yet for days [to come].
**15** And when he spoke with me according to these words, I set my face toward the ground, and I was struck dumb.
**16** And behold, one like the likeness of a son of man touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spoke, and said unto him that stood before me, "O Lord, by reason of your vision my inward parts were turned within me, and I retained no strength.
**17** And how can your servant, O Lord, speak with my Lord such as this? For as for me, from henceforth, strength shall not stand in me, and no breath is left in me."
**18** And he added, and touched me as the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me,
**19** And said unto me, "Fear not, O man of desires: peace be unto you; be strong, yea, be strong." And when he spoke with me, I was strengthened, and I said, "Let my Lord speak, for you have strengthened me."
**20** And he said unto me, "Do you know wherefore I came unto you? And now I will return to fight with the prince of Persia; and as I go forth, behold, the prince of the Greeks shall come.
**21** But I will declare unto you that which is inscribed in the scripture of truth: and there is none that holds with me for these things, but [for us] Michael your prince."
