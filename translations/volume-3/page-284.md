καὶ ἀλοήσουσι τὰς πόλεις τὰς ὀχυρὰς ὑμῶν, ἐφ᾿ αἷς ὑμεῖς πεποίθατε ἐπ᾿ αὐταῖς, ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ.
18 Καὶ ἔσται ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις, λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου, οὐ μὴ ποιήσω ὑμᾶς εἰς συντέλειαν.
19 Καὶ ἔσται ὅταν εἴπητε, τίνος ἕνεκεν ἐποίησε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν ἡμῖν ἅπαντα ταῦτα; καὶ ἐρεῖς αὐτοῖς· ἀνθ᾿ ὧν ἐγκατελείπατέ με, καὶ ἐδουλεύσατε θεοῖς ἀλλοτρίοις ἐν τῇ γῇ ὑμῶν, οὕτως δουλεύσετε ἀλλοτρίοις ἐν γῇ οὐχ ὑμῶν.
20 Ἀναγγείλατε ταῦτα εἰς τὸν οἶκον Ἰακώβ, καὶ ἀκουσθήτω ἐν τῷ Ἰούδα.
21 Ἀκούσατε δὴ ταῦτα λαὸς μωρὸς καὶ ἀκάρδιος, ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτοῖς καὶ οὐ βλέπουσιν, ὦτα αὐτοῖς καὶ οὐκ ἀκούουσι.
22 Μὴ ἐμὲ οὐ φοβηθήσεσθε, λέγει Κύριος; μὴ ἀπὸ προσώπου μου οὐκ εὐλαβηθήσεσθε; τὸν τάξαντα ἄμμον ὅριον τῇ θαλάσσῃ πρόσταγμα αἰώνιον, καὶ οὐχ ὑπερβήσεται αὐτό, καὶ ταραχθήσεται, καὶ οὐ δυνηθήσεται· καὶ ἠχήσουσι τὰ κύματα αὐτῆς καὶ οὐχ ὑπερβήσεται αὐτό.
23 Τῷ δὲ λαῷ τούτῳ ἐγενήθη καρδία ἀνήκοος καὶ ἀπειθής,
24 καὶ ἐξέκλιναν καὶ ἀπῆλθον, καὶ οὐκ εἶπαν ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτῶν, φοβηθῶμεν δὴ Κύριον τὸν Θεὸν ἡμῶν, τὸν διδόντα ἡμῖν ὑετὸν πρώϊμον καὶ ὄψιμον, κατὰ καιρὸν πληρώσεως προστάγματος θερισμοῦ, καὶ ἐφύλαξεν ἡμῖν.
25 Αἱ ἀνομίαι ὑμῶν ἐξέκλιναν ταῦτα, καὶ αἱ ἁμαρτίαι ὑμῶν ἐξαπέστησαν τὰ ἀγαθὰ ἀφ᾿ ὑμῶν.
26 Ὅτι εὑρέθησαν ἐν τῷ λαῷ μου ἀσεβεῖς· παγίδας ἔστησαν διαφθεῖραι ἄνδρας, καὶ συνελάμβανον.
27 Ὡς παγὶς ἐφεσταμένη πλήρης πετεινῶν, οὕτως οἱ οἶκοι αὐτῶν πλήρεις δόλου· διὰ τοῦτο ἐμεγαλύνθησαν, καὶ ἐπλούτησαν·
28 ἐλιπάσθησαν, ἐστεατώθησαν, καὶ παρέβησαν τοὺς λόγους μου εἰς πονηρόν· κρίσιν οὐκ ἔκριναν, κρίσιν ὀρφανοῦ, καὶ κρίσιν χήρας οὐκ ἐκρίνοσαν.
29 Μὴ ἐπὶ τούτοις οὐκ ἐπισκέψομαι, λέγει Κύριος; ἢ ἐν ἔθνει τῷ τοιούτῳ οὐκ ἐκδικήσει ἡ ψυχή μου;
30 Ἔκστασις καὶ φρικτὰ ἐγενήθη ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς·
31 Οἱ προφῆται προφητεύουσιν ἄδικα, καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς ἐπεκράτησαν ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτῶν, καὶ ὁ λαός μου ἠγάπησαν οὕτως; καὶ τί ποιήσετε εἰς τὰ μετὰ ταῦτα;

**17** ...and they shall tread down your fortified cities, wherein ye have put your trust, with the sword.
**18** And it shall come to pass in those days, saith the Lord thy God, that I shall not make a complete end of thee.
**19** And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, "Wherefore hath the Lord our God done all these things unto us?" Then shalt thou say unto them, "Because ye have forsaken Me, and served strange gods in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not your own."
**20** Declare ye these things unto the house of Jacob, and let them be heard in Judah.
**21** Hear now these things, O foolish people, and void of understanding; they have eyes, but they see not; they have ears, but they hear not.
**22** Shall ye not fear Me? saith the Lord. Or shall ye not be in awe before My countenance? [Even] Him that hath appointed the sand for the bounds of the sea, an everlasting decree, which it shall not pass over; and though it toss itself, yet shall it not be able [to pass]; and its waves shall roar, yet shall they not pass over it.
**23** But this people hath gotten a heart that is disobedient and rebellious,
**24** and they turned aside and went their way, neither said they in their heart, "Let us now fear the Lord our God, who giveth us the early rain and the latter rain in its season; who preserveth unto us the appointed measure of the harvest's decree."
**25** Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have withheld the good from you.
**26** For among My people are found wicked men; they set snares to destroy men, [and] they ensnare them.
**27** As a cage full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit. Therefore are they become great and grown rich;
**28** they are waxen fat, they are sleek and corpulent; they have overpassed My words to do evil. They have not judged a [just] judgment, the judgment of the orphan, nor the judgment of the widow have they judged.
**29** Shall I not visit for these things? saith the Lord. Or shall My soul not take vengeance on such a nation as this?
**30** A horror and terrible things are come to pass in the land.
**31** The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their own hands; and My people love it so! And what will ye do in the end thereof?
