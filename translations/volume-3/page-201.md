ΚΕΦ. ΙΑ΄. XI.

**1** ΚΑΙ ἐξελεύσεται ῥάβδος ἐκ τῆς ῥίζης Ἰεσσαί, καὶ ἄνθος
ἐκ τῆς ῥίζης ἀναβήσεται·
**2** καὶ ἀναπαύσεται ἐπ' αὐτὸν πνεῦμα τοῦ Θεοῦ, πνεῦμα σοφίας καὶ συνέσεως, πνεῦμα βουλῆς καὶ ἰσχύος, πνεῦμα γνώσεως καὶ εὐσεβείας·
**3** ἐμπλήσει αὐτὸν πνεῦμα φόβου Θεοῦ. Οὐ κατὰ τὴν δόξαν κρινεῖ, οὐδὲ κατὰ τὴν λαλιὰν ἐλέγχει,
**4** ἀλλὰ κρινεῖ ἐν δικαιοσύνῃ ταπεινῷ κρίσιν, καὶ ἐλέγξει ἐν εὐθύτητι τοὺς ταπεινοὺς τῆς γῆς· καὶ πατάξει γῆν τῷ λόγῳ τοῦ στόματος αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐν πνεύματι διὰ χειλέων ἀνελεῖ ἀσεβῆ·
**5** καὶ ἔσται δικαιοσύνη ἐζωσμένος τὴν ὀσφῦν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀλήθεια εἰλημμένος τὰς πλευρὰς αὐτοῦ.
**6** Καὶ συμβοσκηθήσεται λύκος μετὰ ἀρνὸς, καὶ πάρδαλις συναναπαύσεται ἐρίφῳ, καὶ μοσχάριον καὶ ταῦρος καὶ λέων ἅμα βοσκηθήσονται, καὶ παιδίον μικρὸν ἄξει αὐτούς·
**7** καὶ βοῦς καὶ ἄρκος ἅμα βοσκηθήσονται, καὶ ἅμα τὰ παιδία αὐτῶν ἔσονται, καὶ λέων ὡς βοῦς (ἅμα) φάγεται ἄχυρα.
**8** Καὶ παιδίον νήπιον ἐπὶ τρώγλην ἀσπίδων, καὶ ἀπογεγαλακτισμένον ἐπὶ κοίτην ἐκγόνων ἀσπίδων τὴν χεῖρα ἐπιβαλεῖ·
**9** καὶ οὐ μὴ κακοποιήσουσιν, οὐδ' οὐ μὴ δύνωνται ἀπολέσαι οὐδένα ἐπὶ τὸ ὄρος τὸ ἅγιόν μου· ὅτι ἐνεπλήσθη ἡ σύμπασα τοῦ γνῶναι τὸν Κύριον, ὡς ὕδωρ πολὺ κατακαλύψαι θαλάσσας.
**10** Καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἡ ῥίζα τοῦ Ἰεσσαί, καὶ ὁ ἀνιστάμενος ἄρχειν ἐθνῶν, ἐπ' αὐτῷ ἔθνη ἐλπιοῦσι· καὶ ἔσται ἡ ἀνάπαυσις αὐτοῦ, τιμή.
**11** Καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ προσθήσει Κύριος τοῦ δεῖξαι τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ, τοῦ ζηλῶσαι τὸ καταλειφθὲν ὑπόλοιπον τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ, ὃ ἂν καταλειφθῇ ἀπὸ τῶν Ἀσσυρίων, καὶ ἀπὸ Αἰγύπτου, καὶ ἀπὸ Βαβυλωνίας, καὶ ἀπὸ Αἰθιοπίας, καὶ ἀπὸ Ἐλαμιτῶν, καὶ ἀπὸ ἡλίου ἀνατολῶν, καὶ ἐξ Ἀραβίας, καὶ ἀπὸ νήσων τῆς θαλάσσης·
**12** καὶ ἀρεῖ σημεῖον εἰς τὰ ἔθνη, καὶ συνάξει τοὺς ἀπολομένους Ἰσραήλ, καὶ τοὺς διεσπαρμένους Ἰούδα συνάξει ἐκ τῶν τεσσάρων πτερύγων τῆς γῆς.
**13** Καὶ ἀφαιρεθήσεται ὁ ζῆλος Ἐφραίμ, καὶ οἱ ἐχθροὶ Ἰούδα ἀπολοῦνται· Ἐφραίμ οὐ ζηλώσει Ἰούδαν, καὶ Ἰούδας οὐ θλίψει Ἐφραίμ.
**14** Καὶ πετασθήσονται ἐν πλοίοις ἀλλοφύλων θάλασσαν ἅμα προνομεύσουσι, καὶ τοὺς ἀπ' ἡλίου ἀνατολῶν, καὶ Ἰδουμαίαν· καὶ ἐπὶ Μωὰβ πρῶτον τὰς

**1** And there shall come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse, and a blossom from the root shall ascend.
**2** And the Spirit of God shall rest upon Him, the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and of might, the Spirit of knowledge and of godliness;
**3** the Spirit of the fear of God shall fill Him. He shall not judge according to outward appearance, nor shall He reprove according to [mere] report;
**4** but with righteousness shall He judge [for] the humble, [even] a righteous judgment, and shall reprove with uprightness the meek of the earth; and He shall smite the earth with the word of His mouth, and with the spirit of His lips shall He slay the ungodly.
**5** And righteousness shall be girded about His loins, and truth taken upon His sides.
**6** And the wolf shall feed with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the bull and the lion shall feed together, and a little child shall lead them.
**7** And the ox and the bear shall feed together, and their young ones shall be together; and the lion, as the ox, shall [together] eat straw.
**8** And a nursing child shall lay his hand upon the lair of asps, and a weaned child upon the den of young asps.
**9** And they shall do no harm, nor shall they by any means be able to destroy anyone upon My holy mountain; for the whole [earth] hath been filled with the knowledge of the Lord, as the great waters cover the seas.
**10** And it shall be in that day, the root of Jesse, even He Who riseth to rule the nations, in Him shall the nations hope; and His resting place shall be glory.
**11** And it shall be in that day, that the Lord shall again set forth His hand to reveal Himself, to gather the remnant, the remainder of His people, which shall be left from the Assyrians, and from Egypt, and from Babylonia, and from Ethiopia, and from the Elamites, and from the rising of the sun, and from Arabia, and from the islands of the sea;
**12** and He shall raise up a standard for the nations, and He shall gather the lost of Israel, and the dispersed of Judah shall He gather from the four corners of the earth.
**13** And the jealousy of Ephraim shall be taken away, and the enemies of Judah shall perish; Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not afflict Ephraim.
**14** And they shall fly abroad in the ships of the Philistines; together shall they plunder the sea, and those from the rising of the sun, and Idumaea; and upon Moab first shall they lay their hands,
