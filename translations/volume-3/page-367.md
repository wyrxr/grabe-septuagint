Γοδολίας υἱὸς Ἀχικάμ. Καὶ Ἰωάνναν υἱὸς Καρία εἶπε τῷ Γοδολία 18
κρυφαίως ἐν Μασσηφᾶ, λέγων· πορεύσομαι δὴ καὶ πατάξω τὸν
Ἰσμαὴλ υἱὸν Ναθανίου, καὶ μηδεὶς γνώτω, μὴ ποτε πατάξῃ σου
ψυχήν, καὶ διασπαρήσονται πᾶς Ἰούδα οἱ συνηγμένοι πρὸς σέ,
καὶ ἀπολοῦνται οἱ κατάλοιποι Ἰούδα. Καὶ εἶπε Γοδολίας υἱὸς 16
Ἀχικάμ πρὸς Ἰωάνναν υἱὸν Καριέ· μὴ ποιήσῃς τὸ πρᾶγμα τοῦτο,
ὅτι ψευδῆ σὺ λέγεις κατὰ τοῦ Ἰσμαήλ.

ΚΕΦ. ΜΗ΄. XLVIII.
(Hebr. Cap. XLI.)

ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο τῷ μηνὶ τῷ ἑβδόμῳ, ἦλθεν Ἰσμαὴλ υἱὸς Ναθα- 1
νίου υἱοῦ Ἐλισαμὰ ἀπὸ γένους τῆς βασιλείας, καὶ τὰ παιδάρια
τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ δέκα ἄνδρες μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ πρὸς Γοδολίαν υἱὸν Ἀ-
χικὰμ εἰς Μασσηφᾶ, καὶ ἔφαγον ἐκεῖ ἄρτον ἅμα ἐν Μασσηφᾶ. Καὶ 2
ἀνέστη Ἰσμαὴλ υἱὸς Ναθανίου, καὶ οἱ δέκα ἄνδρες οἱ ἦσαν μετ᾿ αὐ-
τοῦ, καὶ ἐπάταξαν τὸν Γοδολίαν υἱὸν Ἀχικὰμ υἱὸν Σαφὰν ἐν ξομ-
φαίᾳ, καὶ ἀπέκτειναν αὐτόν, ὃν κατέστησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶ-
νος ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, καὶ πάντας τοὺς Ἰουδαίους τοὺς ὄντας μετ᾿ 3
αὐτοῦ τοῦ Γοδολίου, ἐν Μασσηφᾶ, καὶ πάντας τοὺς Χαλδαίους
τοὺς εὑρεθέντας ἐκεῖ καὶ τοὺς ἄνδρας πολέμου ἐπάταξεν Ἰσμαήλ.
Καὶ ἐγένετο τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ δευτέρᾳ πατάξαντος αὐτοῦ τὸν Γο- 4
δολίαν, καὶ ἄνθρωπος οὐκ ἔγνω. Καὶ ἦλθον ἄνδρες ἀπὸ Συχέμ, 5
καὶ ἀπὸ Σαλώμ, καὶ ἀπὸ Σαμαρείας, ὀγδοήκοντα ἄνδρες, ἐξυρη-
μένοι πώγωνας, καὶ διερρηγμένοι τὰ ἱμάτια, καὶ κοπτόμενοι,
καὶ Μανά, καὶ λίβανος ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτῶν, τοῦ εἰσενέγκαι
εἰς οἶκον Κυρίου. Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν εἰς ἀπάντησιν αὐτοῖς Ἰσμαὴλ 6
υἱὸς Ναθανίου ἐκ τῆς Μασσηφά· καὶ αὐτοὶ ἐπορεύοντο, καὶ ἔ-
κλαιον. Ἐγένετο δὲ ἡνίκα ἤγγισεν αὐτοῖς, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· εἰ-
σέλθατε πρὸς Γοδολίαν υἱὸν Ἀχικάμ. Καὶ ἐγένετο, εἰσελθόντων 7
αὐτῶν εἰς τὸ μέσον τῆς πόλεως, καὶ ἔσφαζεν αὐτοὺς Ἰσμαὴλ
υἱὸς Ναθανίου εἰς τὸ φρέαρ, αὐτὸς καὶ ἄνδρες οἱ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ 8
δέκα ἄνδρες εὑρέθησαν ἐκεῖ, καὶ εἶπαν τῷ Ἰσμαήλ· μὴ ἀνέλῃς
ἡμᾶς, ὅτι εἰσὶν ἡμῖν θησαυροὶ ἐν ἀγρῷ, πυροὶ καὶ κριθαί, μέλι
καὶ ἔλαιον· καὶ παρῆλθε, καὶ οὐκ ἀνεῖλεν αὐτοὺς ἐν μέσῳ τῶν
ἀδελφῶν αὐτῶν. Καὶ τὸ φρέαρ, εἰς ὃ ἔῤῥιψεν ἐκεῖ Ἰσμαὴλ πάντα 9

**JEREMIAH 47**

**15** Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. And Johanan the son of Karia spake to Gedaliah secretly in Mizpah, saying, I will go forth now and smite Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and let no man know [of it], lest he smite thy soul, and all Judah which are gathered unto thee be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish.

**16** And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Karie, Do not this thing, for thou speakest falsely concerning Ishmael.

**JEREMIAH 48**

**1** Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal seed, and the king’s officers, and ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and they did eat bread together there in Mizpah.

**2** Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the land.

**3** And [Ishmael] smote all the Jews that were with him, even Gedaliah, in Mizpah, and all the Chaldeans that were found there, and the men of war did Ishmael smite.

**4** And it came to pass the second day after he had smitten Gedaliah, and no man knew [of it].

**5** And there came men from Shechem, from Shalem, and from Samaria, fourscore men, having shaven their beards, and with their clothes torn, and cutting themselves, and with manna [offerings] and frankincense in their hands, to bring them into the house of the Lord.

**6** And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them; and as they went, they wept. And it came to pass, when he drew near unto them, he said unto them, Come ye to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.

**7** And it came to pass, when they were come into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them into the pit, he and the men that were with him.

**8** But ten men were found there [among them], and they said unto Ishmael, Slay us not, for we have treasures in the field, of wheat and barley, honey and oil. So he passed them over, and slew them not among their brethren.

**9** Now the pit wherein Ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had smitten with Gedaliah – this is the great pit which King Asa had made because of Baasha king of Israel – this did Ishmael fill with the slain.
