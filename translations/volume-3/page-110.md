**ΨΑΛΜ. ΡΜΔ΄. CXLIV.**
13 Δόξαν τῆς μεγαλοπρεπείας τῆς βασιλείας σου. Ἡ βασιλεία σου βα-
    σιλεία πάντων τῶν αἰώνων, καὶ ἡ δεσποτεία σου ἐν πάσῃ γενεᾷ
14 καὶ γενεᾷ. Πιστὸς Κύριος ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς λόγοις αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὅσιος
    ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς ἔργοις αὐτοῦ· ὑποστηρίζει Κύριος πάντας τοὺς κα-
15 ταπίπτοντας, καὶ ἀνορθοῖ πάντας τοὺς κατεῤῥαγμένους. Οἱ ὀφθαλ-
    μοὶ πάντων εἰς σὲ ἐλπίζουσι, καὶ σὺ δίδως τὴν τροφὴν αὐτῶν ἐν
16 εὐκαιρίᾳ· ἀνοίγεις σὺ τὴν χεῖρά σου, καὶ ἐμπιπλᾷς πᾶν ζῶον εὐ-
17 δοκίας. Δίκαιος Κύριος ἐν πάσαις ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὅσιος ἐν
18 πᾶσι τοῖς ἔργοις αὐτοῦ. Ἐγγὺς Κύριος πᾶσι τοῖς ἐπικαλουμένοις
19 αὐτὸν, πᾶσι τοῖς ἐπικαλουμένοις αὐτὸν ἐν ἀληθείᾳ· θέλημα τῶν
    φοβουμένων αὐτὸν ποιήσει, καὶ τῆς δεήσεως αὐτῶν ἐπακούσεται,
20 καὶ σώσει αὐτούς. Φυλάσσει Κύριος πάντας τοὺς ἀγαπῶντας αὐ-
21 τὸν· καὶ πάντας τοὺς ἁμαρτωλοὺς ἐξολεθρεύσει. Αἴνεσιν Κυρίου
    λαλήσει τὸ στόμα μου· καὶ εὐλογείτω πᾶσα σὰρξ τὸ ὄνομα τὸ
    ἅγιον αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα καὶ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τοῦ αἰῶνος.

1   ἈΛΛΗΛΟΥΪΑ Ἀγγαίου καὶ Ζαχαρίου. Αἴνει ἡ ψυχή μου τὸν
2   Κύριον· αἰνέσω Κύριον ἐν ζωῇ μου, ψαλῶ τῷ Θεῷ μου ἕως ὑπάρ-
3   χω. Μὴ πεποίθατε ἐπ’ ἄρχοντας, (καὶ) ἐπὶ υἱοὺς ἀνθρώπων, οἷς
4   οὐκ ἔστι σωτηρία· ἐξελεύσεται τὸ πνεῦμα αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπιστρέψει
    εἰς τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ· ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἀπολοῦνται πάντες οἱ δια-
5   λογισμοὶ αὐτοῦ. Μακάριος οὗ ὁ Θεὸς Ἰακὼβ βοηθὸς αὐτοῦ, ἡ ἐλ-
6   πὶς αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ Κύριον τὸν Θεὸν αὐτοῦ· τὸν ποιήσαντα τὸν οὐρανὸν
    καὶ τὴν γῆν, τὴν θάλασσαν καὶ πάντα τὰ ἐν αὐτοῖς· τὸν φυλάσ-
7   σοντα ἀλήθειαν εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα· ποιοῦντα κρίμα τοῖς ἀδικουμένοις·
8   διδόντα τροφὴν τοῖς πεινῶσι. Κύριος λύει πεπεδημένους· Κύριος
    ἀνορθοῖ κατεῤῥαγμένους· Κύριος σοφοῖ τυφλούς· Κύριος ἀγαπᾷ
9   δικαίους· Κύριος φυλάσσει τοὺς προσηλύτους, ὀρφανὸν καὶ χήραν
10  ἀναλήψεται· καὶ ὁδὸν ἁμαρτωλῶν ἀφανίσει. Βασιλεύσει Κύριος εἰς
    τὸν αἰῶνα, ὁ Θεός σου Σιὼν εἰς γενεὰν καὶ γενεάν.

**PSALM 144 (LXX 144) [continued].**

**13** ...[the] glory of the majesty of Thy kingdom.
    Thy kingdom is a kingdom of all the ages,
    and Thy dominion is in every generation and generation.
**14** The Lord is faithful in all His words,
    and holy in all His works.
    The Lord upholdeth all them that fall,
**15** and raiseth up all them that are broken down.
    The eyes of all hope in Thee,
    and Thou givest them their food in due season.
**16** Thou openest Thy hand,
    and fillest every living thing with [Thy] good pleasure.
**17** Righteous is the Lord in all His ways,
    and holy in all His works.
**18** The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon Him,
    unto all them that call upon Him in truth.
**19** He will fulfill the desire of them that fear Him;
    He will also hear their supplication, and will save them.
**20** The Lord preserveth all them that love Him;
**21** but all the wicked will He utterly destroy.
    My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord;
    and let all flesh bless His holy Name for ever,
    yea, for ever and ever.

**PSALM 145 (LXX 145).**

*Alleluia. Of Haggai and Zechariah.*
**1** Praise the Lord, O my soul.
**2** I will praise the Lord in my life,
    I will sing praises unto my God while I have my being.
**3** Trust not in princes, [nor] in the sons of men,
**4** in whom there is no salvation;
    His spirit shall go forth, and he shall return to his earth;
    in that very day all his thoughts shall perish.
**5** Blessed is he whose helper is the God of Jacob,
    whose hope is in the Lord his God;
**6** Who made the heaven and the earth,
    the sea and all that is therein;
    Who keepeth truth for ever;
**7** Who executeth judgment for them that are oppressed;
**8** Who giveth food to the hungry.
    The Lord looseth those that are bound;
    the Lord raiseth up them that are broken down;
    the Lord maketh the blind to see;
    the Lord loveth the righteous.
**9** The Lord preserveth the strangers;
    He will take up the orphan and the widow;
**10** but the way of the wicked will He make to vanish.
    The Lord shall reign for ever,
    even thy God, O Zion, unto generation and generation.

**PSALM 146 (LXX 146).**

*Alleluia. Of Haggai and Zechariah.*
**1** Praise ye the Lord,
