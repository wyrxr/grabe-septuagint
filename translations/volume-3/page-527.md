**5** τοῦ· ὅτι οὐκ ἠθέλησεν ἐπιστρέψαι.
**6** ταῖς πόλεσιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ κατέπαυσεν ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτοῦ· καὶ φάγονται ἐκ τῶν διαβουλίων αὐτῶν.
**7** Καὶ ὁ λαὸς αὐτοῦ ἐπικρεμάμενος ἐκ τῆς κατοικίας αὐτοῦ· διὸ Θεὸς ἐπὶ τὰ τίμια αὐτοῦ θυμωθήσεται, καὶ οὐ μὴ ὑψώσῃ αὐτόν.
**8** Τί σε διαβῶ Ἐφραίμ; ὑπερασπιῶ σου Ἰσραήλ; τί σε διαβῶ; ὡς Ἀδάμα θήσομαί σε καὶ ὡς Σεβοείμ; μετεστράφη ἡ καρδία μου ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ, συνεταράχθη ἡ μεταμέλειά μου·
**9** οὐ μὴ ποιήσω κατὰ τὴν ὀργὴν τοῦ θυμοῦ μου, οὐ μὴ ἐγκαταλίπω τοῦ ἐξαλειφθῆναι τὸν Ἐφραίμ· διότι Θεὸς ἐγώ εἰμι, καὶ οὐκ ἄνθρωπος. Ἐν σοὶ ἅγιος, καὶ εἰσελεύσομαι εἰς πόλιν·
**10** ὀπίσω Κυρίου πορεύσομαι· ὡς λέων ἐρεύξεται, ὅτι αὐτὸς ὠρύσεται, καὶ ἐκστήσονται τέκνα ὑδάτων·
**11** καὶ ἐκστήσονται ὡς ὄρνεον ἐξ Αἰγύπτου, καὶ ὡς περιστερὰ ἐκ γῆς Ἀσσυρίων· καὶ ἀποκαταστήσω αὐτοὺς εἰς τοὺς οἴκους αὐτῶν, λέγει Κύριος.
**12** Ἐκύκλωσέ με ἐν ψεύδει Ἐφραίμ, καὶ ἐν ἀσεβείᾳ οἶκος Ἰσραὴλ καὶ Ἰούδα· νῦν ἔγνω αὐτοὺς ὁ Θεός, καὶ λαὸς ἅγιος κληθήσεται Θεοῦ.

**ΚΕΦ. ΙΒ'. ΧΙΙ.**

**1** Ὁ δὲ Ἐφραὶμ πονηρὸν πνεῦμα, ἐδίωξε καύσωνα ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν· κενὰ καὶ μάταια ἐπλήθυνε, καὶ διαθήκην μετὰ Ἀσσυρίων διέθετο, καὶ ἔλαιον εἰς Αἴγυπτον ἐνεπορεύετο.
**2** Καὶ κρίσις τῷ Κυρίῳ πρὸς τὸν Ἰούδαν, τοῦ ἐκδικῆσαι τὸν Ἰακώβ· κατὰ τὰς ὁδοὺς αὐτοῦ καὶ κατὰ τὰ ἐπιτηδεύματα αὐτοῦ ἀνταποδώσει αὐτῷ.
**3** Ἐν τῇ κοιλίᾳ ἐντέρνισε τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐν κόποις αὐτοῦ ἐνίσχυσε πρὸς τὸν Θεόν·
**4** καὶ ἐνίσχυσε μετὰ ἀγγέλου, καὶ ἠδυνάσθη. Ἔκλαυσαν, ἐδεήθησάν μου· ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ Ὢν εὕροσάν με, καὶ ἐκεῖ ἐλαλήθη πρὸς αὐτούς.
**5** Ὁ δὲ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὁ παντοκράτωρ ἔσται μνημόσυνον αὐτοῦ.
**6** Καὶ σὺ ἐν Θεῷ σου ἐπιστρέψεις, ἔλεον καὶ κρῖμα φυλάσσου, καὶ ἔγγιζε πρὸς τὸν Θεόν σου διαπαντός.
**7** Χαναὰν ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ ζυγὸς ἀδικίας, καταδυναστεύειν ἠγάπησε.
**8** Καὶ εἶπεν Ἐφραίμ· πλὴν πεπλούτηκα, εὕρηκα ἀναψυχὴν ἐμαυτῷ· πάντες οἱ πόνοι αὐτοῦ οὐχ εὑρεθήσονται αὐτῷ, διὰ ἀδικίας ἃς ἥμαρτεν.
**9** Ἐγὼ δὲ Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου ἀνήγαγόν σε ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου· ἔτι κατοικιῶ σε ἐν σκηναῖς, καθὼς ἡμέρα ἑορτῆς·
**10** καὶ λαλήσω πρὸς προφήτας, καὶ ἐγὼ ὁράσεις ἐπλήθυνα, καὶ ἐν χερσὶ

**CHAPTER 11**

**5** Of him; forasmuch as he would not turn back.
**6** [He shall go] to his cities; and he shall rest in his own hands; and they shall eat of their own counsels.
**7** And his people, hanging suspended from his dwelling; wherefore God shall be wroth against his precious things, and He shall by no means lift him up.
**8** How shall I give thee up, O Ephraim? Shall I protect thee, O Israel? How shall I give thee up? How shall I make thee as Admah and as Zeboiim? My heart is turned within Me, and My compassion is stirred.
**9** I shall not execute the fierceness of Mine anger, nor shall I forsake Ephraim to be utterly destroyed. For I am God, and not man; the Holy One [is] in thy midst, and I shall come into a city.
**10** They shall walk after the Lord; He shall roar as a lion, for He Himself shall roar, and the children of the waters shall stand in awe.
**11** And they shall come forth as a bird from Egypt, and as a dove from the land of the Assyrians; and I will restore them to their houses, saith the Lord.
**12** Ephraim hath encircled Me with lies, and the house of Israel and Judah with ungodliness. Now God hath acknowledged them, and a holy people shall be called of God.

**CHAPTER 12**

**1** But Ephraim is an evil spirit; he hath pursued the east wind all the day; he hath multiplied vain and empty things. And he made a covenant with the Assyrians, and oil was carried into Egypt.
**2** And the Lord hath a judgment against Judah, to avenge Jacob; according to his ways and according to his practices shall He repay him.
**3** In the womb he did supplant his brother, and in his struggles he prevailed with God.
**4** Yea, he prevailed with an angel, and was strengthened. They wept and besought Me; in the house of On they found Me, and there was [My word] spoken unto them.
**5** Even the Lord God Almighty, He shall be His memorial.
**6** Therefore do thou return unto thy God, keep mercy and judgment, and draw near unto thy God continually.
**7** Canaan hath in his hand the balances of injustice; he hath loved to oppress.
**8** And Ephraim said, 'Surely I am become rich, I have found refreshment for myself; all his labours shall not be found sufficient for him on account of the iniquities which he hath sinned.'
**9** But I am the Lord thy God, Who brought thee up from the land of Egypt. Yet will I cause thee to dwell in tents, as in the day of a feast.
**10** And I will speak unto the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and in hands.
