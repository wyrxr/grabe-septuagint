**41** πόδας, καὶ τοὺς δακτύλους, μέρος μέν τι ὀστράκινον κεραμίου, μέρος δέ τι σιδηροῦν, βασιλεία διῃρημένη ἔσται, καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς ῥίζης τῆς σιδηρᾶς ἔσται ἐν αὐτῇ, ὃν τρόπον εἶδες τὸν σίδηρον ἀναμεμιγμένον τῷ ὀστράκῳ.
**42** Καὶ οἱ δάκτυλοι τῶν ποδῶν μέρος μέν τι σιδηροῦν, μέρος δέ τι ὀστράκινον, μέρος δέ τι τῆς βασιλείας ἔσται ἰσχυρόν, καὶ ἀπ᾽ αὐτῆς ἔσται συντριβόμενον.
**43** Ὅτι εἶδες τὸν σίδηρον ἀναμεμιγμένον τῷ ὀστράκῳ, συμμιγεῖς ἔσονται ἐν σπέρματι ἀνθρώπων, καὶ οὐκ ἔσονται προσκολλώμενοι οὗτος μετὰ τούτου, καθὼς ὁ σίδηρος οὐκ ἀναμίγνυται μετὰ τοῦ ὀστράκου.
**44** Καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις τῶν βασιλέων ἐκείνων ἀναστήσει ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ οὐρανοῦ βασιλείαν, ἥτις εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας οὐ διαφθαρήσεται, καὶ ἡ βασιλεία αὐτοῦ λαῷ ἑτέρῳ οὐχ ὑπολειφθήσεται, λεπτυνεῖ δὲ καὶ λιχμήσει πάσας τὰς βασιλείας, καὶ αὕτη ἀναστήσεται εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας,
**45** ὃν τρόπον εἶδες, ὅτι ἀπὸ ὄρους ἐτμήθη λίθος ἄνευ χειρῶν, καὶ ἐλέπτυνε τὸ ὄστρακον, τὸν σίδηρον, τὸν χαλκόν, τὸν ἄργυρον, τὸν χρυσόν· ὁ Θεὸς ὁ μέγας ἐγνώρισε τῷ βασιλεῖ ἃ δεῖ γενέσθαι μετὰ ταῦτα· καὶ ἀληθινὸν τὸ ἐνύπνιον, καὶ πιστὴ ἡ σύγκρισις αὐτοῦ.
**46** Τότε ὁ βασιλεὺς Ναβουχοδονόσορ ἔπεσεν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον, καὶ τῷ Δανιὴλ προσεκύνησε, καὶ Μαναὰ καὶ εὐωδίας καὶ εἶπε σπεῖσαι αὐτῷ.
**47** Καὶ ἀποκριθεὶς ὁ βασιλεύς, εἶπε τῷ Δανιήλ, ἐπ᾽ ἀληθείας ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν, αὐτός ἐστι Θεὸς Θεῶν, καὶ Κύριος τῶν κυρίων, καὶ βασιλεὺς τῶν βασιλέων, ὁ ἀποκαλύπτων μυστήρια, ὅτι ἠδυνάσθης ἀποκαλύψαι τὸ μυστήριον τοῦτο.
**48** Καὶ ἐμεγάλυνεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τὸν Δανιήλ, καὶ δόματα πολλὰ καὶ μεγάλα καὶ πολλὰ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ, καὶ κατέστησεν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ πάσης χώρας Βαβυλῶνος, καὶ ἄρχοντα σατραπῶν, καὶ ἐπὶ πάντας τοὺς σοφοὺς Βαβυλῶνος.
**49** Καὶ Δανιὴλ ἠτήσατο παρὰ τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ κατέστησεν ἐπὶ τὰ ἔργα τῆς χώρας Βαβυλῶνος τὸν Σεδράχ, Μισάχ, καὶ Ἀβδεναγώ· καὶ Δανιὴλ ἦν ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ τοῦ βασιλέως.

**1** ΕΤΟΥΣ ὀκτωκαιδεκάτου Ναβουχοδονόσορ ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐποίησεν εἰκόνα χρυσῆν, ὕψος αὐτῆς πήχεων ἑξήκοντα, εὖρος αὐτῆς πήχεων ἕξ· καὶ ἔστησεν αὐτὴν ἐν πεδίῳ Δειρᾷ, ἐν χώρᾳ Βαβυλῶνος.

**45** Forasmuch as thou didst see that a stone was cut out of a mountain without hands, and it brake in pieces the clay, the iron, the bronze, the silver, and the gold, so hath the Great God made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter.
