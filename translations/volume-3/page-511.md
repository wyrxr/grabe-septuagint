**ΚΕΦ. ΙΑ΄. Δ Α Ν Ι Η Λ 1449**

**11** ταβαλεῖ μυριάδας, καὶ οὐ κατισχύσει.
**12** Καὶ ἐπιστρέψει ὁ βασιλεὺς τοῦ βορρᾶ, καὶ ἄξει ὄχλον πολὺν ὑπὲρ τὸν πρότερον· καὶ εἰς τὸ τέλος τῶν καιρῶν ἐνιαυτῶν ἐπελεύσεται εἰσόδια ἐν δυνάμει μεγάλῃ, καὶ ἐν ὑπάρξει πολλῇ.
**13** Καὶ ἐν τοῖς καιροῖς ἐκείνοις πολλοὶ ἐπαναστήσονται ἐπὶ βασιλέα τοῦ νότου, καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ τῶν λοιμῶν τοῦ λαοῦ σου ἐπαρθήσονται, τοῦ στῆσαι δρᾶσιν, καὶ ἀσθενήσουσι.
**14** Καὶ εἰσελεύσεται ὁ βασιλεὺς τοῦ βορρᾶ, καὶ ἐκχεεῖ πρόσχωμα, καὶ συλλήψεται πόλεις ὀχυράς, καὶ οἱ βραχίονες τοῦ βασιλέως τοῦ νότου οὐ στήσονται, καὶ ἀναστήσονται οἱ ἐκλεκτοὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ἰσχὺς τοῦ στῆναι.
**15** Καὶ ποιήσει ὁ εἰσπορευόμενος πρὸς αὐτὸν κατὰ τὸ θέλημα αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἑστὼς κατὰ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ· καὶ στήσεται ἐν γῇ τοῦ Σαβεί, καὶ συντελεσθήσεται ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ.
**16** Καὶ τάξει τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ εἰσελθεῖν ἐν ἰσχύϊ πάσης τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ, καὶ εὐθεῖα πάντα μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ ποιήσει· καὶ θυγατέρα τῶν γυναικῶν δώσει αὐτῷ τοῦ διαφθεῖραι αὐτήν, καὶ οὐ μὴ παραμείνῃ, καὶ οὐκ αὐτῷ ἔσται.
**17** Καὶ ἐπιστρέψει τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ εἰς τὰς νήσους, καὶ συλλήψεται πολλάς, καὶ καταπαύσει ἄρχοντας ὀνειδισμοῦ αὐτῶν, πλὴν ὁ ὀνειδισμὸς αὐτοῦ ἐπιστρέψει αὐτῷ.
**18** Καὶ ἐπιστρέψει τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ εἰς τὴν ἰσχὺν τῆς γῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀσθενήσει, καὶ πεσεῖται, καὶ οὐχ εὑρεθήσεται.
**19** Καὶ ἀναστήσεται ἐκ τῆς ῥίζης αὐτοῦ φυτὸν βασιλείας ἐπὶ τὴν ἑτοιμασίαν αὐτοῦ παραδιδούς, πράσσων δόξαν βασιλείας· καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις συντριβήσεται, καὶ οὐκ ἐν προσώποις, οὐδὲ ἐν πολέμῳ.
**20** Στήσεται ἐπὶ τὴν ἑτοιμασίαν αὐτοῦ, ἐξουδενώθη, καὶ οὐκ ἔδωκαν ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸν δόξαν βασιλείας· καὶ ἥξει ἐν εὐθηνίᾳ, καὶ κατισχύσει βασιλείας ἐν ὀλισθήμασι.
**21** Καὶ βραχίονες τοῦ καταλύοντος (καὶ) καταλυσθήσονται ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ, καὶ συντριβήσονται, καὶ ἡγούμενος διαθήκης.
**22** Καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν συναναμίξεων πρὸς αὐτὸν ποιήσει δόλον, καὶ ἀναβήσεται, καὶ ὑπερισχύσει αὐτοὺς ἐν ὀλίγῳ ἔθνει.
**23** Καὶ ἐν εὐθηνίᾳ, καὶ ἐν ποσὶν χώραις ἥξει, καὶ ποιήσει ἃ οὐκ ἐποίησαν οἱ πατέρες αὐτοῦ καὶ οἱ πατέρες τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ· προνομὴν καὶ σκῦλα καὶ ὕπαρξιν αὐτοῖς διασκορπίσει, καὶ ἐπ᾽ Αἴγυπτον λογιεῖται διαλογισμοὺς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἕως καιροῦ.
**24** Καὶ ἐξεγερθήσεται ἡ ἰσχὺς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ βασιλέα τοῦ νότου ἐν δυνάμει μεγάλῃ, καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς

**Chapter 11.**

**11** ...and shall cast down myriads, yet shall he not prevail.
**12** And the king of the North shall turn back, and shall bring forth a multitude far greater than the former. And at the end of [a season of] years, he shall come with expeditions in great might, and with much substance.
**13** And in those times many shall rise up against the king of the South. And the sons of the destroyers of thy people shall lift themselves up to make a stand, but they shall fall.
**14** And the king of the North shall come and cast up a rampart, and shall take fortified cities. And the arms of the king of the South shall not stand; yea, his chosen ones shall rise up, yet there shall be no strength to stand.
**15** And he that entereth against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before his face. And he shall stand in the Land of Sheba, and it shall be perfected in his hand.
**16** And he shall set his face to enter with the strength of all his kingdom, and shall make all things straight concerning him. And he shall give him a daughter of women to corrupt her; yet shall she not abide, neither shall she be for him.
**17** And he shall turn his face unto the islands, and shall capture many. And he shall cause the princes of their reproach to cease; nevertheless, his own reproach shall turn back upon him.
**18** And he shall turn his face unto the stronghold of his own land; yet shall he stumble and fall, and shall not be found.
**19** And from his root shall arise a shoot of a kingdom, delivering [power] in his stead, performing the glory of a kingdom. Yet in those days he shall be broken, not in open array, neither in battle.
**20** He shall stand in his own stead; [yet] he was scorned, and they did not confer upon him the glory of a kingdom. And he shall come in prosperity, and shall seize the kingdom by intrigues.
**21** And the arms of the destroyer (and) shall be shattered before his face, and shall be utterly broken, even the leader of the covenant.
**22** And by means of those who ally with him he shall work deceit, and he shall rise up and shall prevail over them with a small people.
**23** And in prosperity, and by foot in lands shall he come, and shall do that which his fathers and the fathers of his fathers have not done. Plunder and spoil and substance shall he scatter among them. And against Egypt he shall devise his stratagems, even for an appointed time.
**24** And his strength shall be roused, and his heart [set] against the king of the South with great power. And the king [of the South...]
