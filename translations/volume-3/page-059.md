**ΨΑΛΜ. ΟΖ΄. ΨΑΛΤΗΡΙΟΝ. 997**
37 τῶν ἐψεύσαντο αὐτῷ· ἡ δὲ καρδία αὐτῶν οὐκ εὐθεῖα μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ,
   οὐδὲ ἐπιστώθησαν ἐν τῇ διαθήκῃ αὐτοῦ.
38 Αὐτὸς δέ ἐστιν οἰκτίρμων, καὶ ἰλάσεται ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις αὐτῶν, καὶ οὐ διαφθερεῖ, καὶ
   πληθυνεῖ τοῦ ἀποστρέψαι τὸν θυμὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐχὶ ἐκκαύσει πᾶσαν τὴν ὀργὴν αὐτοῦ·
39 καὶ ἐμνήσθη ὅτι σάρξ εἰσι, πνεῦμα πορευόμενον καὶ οὐκ ἐπιστρέφον.
40 Ποσάκις παρεπίκραναν αὐτὸν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, παρώργισαν αὐτὸν ἐν γῇ ἀνύδρῳ;
41 Καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν, καὶ ἐπείρασαν τὸν Θεόν, καὶ τὸν ἅγιον τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ παρώξυναν.
42 Οὐκ ἐμνήσθησαν τῆς χειρὸς αὐτοῦ, ἡμέρας ἧς ἐλυτρώσατο αὐτοὺς ἐκ χειρὸς
   θλίβοντος·
43 ὡς ἔθετο ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ τὰ σημεῖα αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰ τέρατα αὐτοῦ ἐν πεδίῳ Τάνεως.
44 Καὶ μετέστρεψεν εἰς αἷμα τοὺς ποταμοὺς αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ ὑμβρήματα αὐτῶν, ὅπως μὴ πίωσιν.
45 Ἐξαπέστειλεν εἰς αὐτοὺς κυνόμυιαν, καὶ κατέφαγεν αὐτοὺς· καὶ βάτραχον, καὶ διέφθειρεν αὐτοὺς·
46 καὶ ἔδωκε τῇ ἐρυσίβῃ τὸν καρπὸν αὐτῶν, καὶ τοὺς πόνους αὐτῶν τῇ ἀκρίδι.
47 Ἀπέκτεινεν ἐν χαλάζῃ τὴν ἄμπελον αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰς συκαμίνους αὐτῶν ἐν τῇ πάγνη.
48 Καὶ παρέδωκεν εἰς χαλάζαν τὰ κτήνη αὐτῶν, καὶ τὴν ὕπαρξιν αὐτῶν τῷ πυρί.
49 Ἐξαπέστειλεν εἰς αὐτοὺς ὀργὴν θυμοῦ αὐτοῦ, θυμὸν καὶ ὀργὴν καὶ θλῖψιν, ἀποστολὴν δι᾽ ἀγγέλων πονηρῶν.
50 Ὡδοποίησε τρίβον τῇ ὀργῇ αὐτοῦ· οὐκ ἐφείσατο ἀπὸ θανάτου τῶν
   ψυχῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰ κτήνη αὐτῶν εἰς θάνατον συνέκλεισε·
51 καὶ ἐπάταξε πᾶν πρωτότοκον ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ, ἀπαρχὴν πόνων αὐτῶν
   ἐν τοῖς σκηνώμασι Χάμ.
52 Καὶ ἀπῆρεν ὡσεὶ πρόβατα τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀνήγαγεν αὐτοὺς ὡσεὶ ποίμνιον ἐν ἐρήμῳ.
53 Καὶ ὡδήγησεν αὐτοὺς ἐν ἐλπίδι, καὶ οὐκ ἐδειλίασαν· καὶ τοὺς ἐχθροὺς αὐτῶν ἐκάλυψε θάλασσα.
54 Καὶ εἰσήγαγεν αὐτοὺς εἰς ὄριον ἁγίασμα τος αὐτοῦ, ὄρος τοῦτο ὃ ἐκτήσατο ἡ δεξιὰ αὐτοῦ.
55 Καὶ ἐξέβαλεν ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτῶν ἔθνη, καὶ ἐκληροδότησεν αὐτοὺς ἐν σχοινίῳ
   κληροδοσίας, καὶ κατεσκήνωσεν ἐν τοῖς σκηνώμασιν αὐτῶν τὰς
   φυλὰς τοῦ Ἰσραήλ.
56 Καὶ ἐπείρασαν καὶ παρεπίκραναν τὸν Θεὸν τὸν Ὕψιστον, καὶ τὰ μαρτύρια αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἐφυλάξαντο·
57 καὶ ἀπέστρεψαν, καὶ ἠσυνθέτησαν, καθὼς καὶ οἱ πατέρες αὐτῶν· μετεστράφησαν ὡς
   τόξον στρεβλόν.
58 Καὶ παρώργισαν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τοῖς βουνοῖς αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐν τοῖς γλυπτοῖς αὐτῶν παρεζήλωσαν αὐτόν.
59 Ἤκουσεν ὁ Θεὸς καὶ ὑπερεῖδε, καὶ ἐξουδένωσε σφόδρα τὸν Ἰσραήλ·
60 καὶ ἀπώσατο τὴν σκηνὴν Σηλώμ, σκήνωμα αὐτοῦ, οὗ κατεσκήνωσεν ἐν ἀνθρώποις·

**PSALM LXXVII.**

37 Their tongue lied unto Him;
But their heart was not upright with Him,
Neither were they steadfast in His covenant.
38 Yet He is merciful, and shall be propitious unto their sins,
And He shall not destroy [them];
Yea, He shall multiply to turn away His wrath,
And shall not kindle all His indignation.
39 For He remembered that they are but flesh;
A spirit that passeth away, and returneth not again.
40 How often did they provoke Him in the wilderness,
And grieve Him in the dry land?
41 Yea, they turned back and tempted God,
And provoked the Holy One of Israel.
42 They remembered not His hand,
Nor the day when He delivered them from the hand of the oppressor;
43 How He had set His signs in Egypt,
And His wonders in the field of Zoan.
44 And He turned their rivers into blood,
And their waters, that they could not drink.
45 He sent among them dog-flies, and they devoured them;
And the frog, and it destroyed them.
46 And He gave their fruit unto the blight,
And their labors unto the locust.
47 He slew their vines with hail,
And their sycamore trees with the frost.
48 And He delivered their cattle to the hail,
And their possessions to the fire.
49 He sent upon them the fierceness of His wrath,
Wrath and indignation and trouble,
[Even] a mission through evil angels.
50 He made a path for His wrath;
He spared not their souls from death,
And shut up their cattle to death.
51 And He smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt,
The firstfruits of their labors in the tabernacles of Ham.
52 And He took away His people as sheep,
And led them forth as a flock in the wilderness.
53 And He led them in hope, and they feared not;
But the sea covered their enemies.
54 And He brought them into His holy mountain-region,
[Even] a sanctuary thereof, His own;
This mountain which His right hand had acquired.
55 And He cast out the nations from before them,
And He gave them an inheritance by a line of heritage,
And He made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tabernacles.
56 Yet they tempted and provoked God the Most High,
And kept not His testimonies;
57 And they turned back, and dealt unfaithfully,
Like as their fathers;
They were turned aside like a crooked bow.
58 And they provoked Him to wrath upon their hills,
And moved Him to jealousy with their graven images.
59 God heard and disregarded [them],
And utterly rejected Israel;
60 And He rejected the tabernacle of Shiloh,
His dwelling place, where He had dwelt among men;
