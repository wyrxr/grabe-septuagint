                 ΠΡΟΣΕΥΧΗ Ἀμβακούμ.
**1.2** Κύριε εἰσακήκοα τὴν ἀκοήν σου, καὶ ἐφοβήθην· Κύριε κατενόησα τὰ ἔργα σου, καὶ ἐξέστην. Ἐν μέσῳ δύο ζώων γνωσθήσῃ, ἐν τῷ ἐγγίζειν τὰ ἔτη ἐπιγνωσθήσῃ, ἐν τῷ παρεῖναι τὸν καιρὸν ἀναδειχθήσῃ· ἐν τῷ ταραχθῆναι τὴν ψυχήν μου, ἐν ὀργῇ ἐλέους μνησθήσῃ.
**3** Ὁ Θεὸς ἐκ Θαιμὰν ἥξει, καὶ ὁ ἅγιος ἐξ ὄρους (Φαρὰν) κατασκίου δασέος. Διάψαλμα. Ἐκάλυψαν οὐρανοὺς ἡ ἀρετὴ αὐτοῦ, καὶ αἰνέσεως αὐτοῦ πλήρης ἡ γῆ.
**4** Καὶ φέγγος αὐτοῦ ὡς φῶς ἔσται· κέρατα ἐν χερσὶν αὐτοῦ ὑπάρχει αὐτῷ· καὶ ἔθετο ἀγάπησιν κραταιὰν ἰσχύος αὐτοῦ.
**5** Πρὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ πορεύσεται λόγος, καὶ ἐξελεύσεται ἐν πεδίοις κατὰ πόδας αὐτοῦ.
**6** Ἔστη, καὶ ἐσαλεύθη ἡ γῆ· ἐπέβλεψε, καὶ ἐτάκη ἔθνη· καὶ διεῤῥύη τὰ ὄρη βίᾳ, ἐτάκησαν βουνοὶ αἰώνιοι πορείαις αἰωνίοις αὐτοῦ.
**7** Ἀντὶ κόπων εἶδον σκηνώματα Αἰθιόπων, πτοηθήσονται καὶ αἱ σκηναὶ γῆς Μαδιάμ. Διάψαλμα.
**8** Μὴ ἐν ποταμοῖς ὠργίσθης Κύριε; μὴ ἐν ποταμοῖς ὁ θυμός σου; ἢ ἐν θαλάσσῃ τὸ ὅρμημά σου; ὅτι ἐπίβησιν ἐπὶ τοὺς ἵππους σου, καὶ ἡ ἱππασία σου σωτηρία.
**9** Ἐντείνων ἐντενεῖς τὸ τόξον σου ἐπὶ τὰ σκῆπτρα, λέγει Κύριος. Διάψαλμα.
**10** Ποταμοῖς ἐραγήσεται γῆ· ὄψονται σε καὶ ὠδινήσουσι λαοὶ, σκορπίζων ὕδατα πορείας (αὐτοῦ). Ἔδωκεν ἡ ἄβυσσος φωνὴν αὐτῆς· ὕψος φαντασίας αὐτῆς ἐπήρθη.
**11** Ὁ ἥλιος καὶ ἡ σελήνη ἔστη ἐν τῇ τάξει αὐτῆς· εἰς φῶς βολίδες σου πορεύονται, εἰς φέγγος ἀστραπῆς ὅπλων σου.
**12** Ἐν ἀπειλῇ (σου) ὀλιγώσεις γῆν, καὶ ἐν θυμῷ κατατάξεις ἔθνη.
**13** Ἐξῆλθες εἰς σωτηρίαν λαοῦ σου, τοῦ σῶσαι τοὺς χριστούς σου. Ἔβαλες εἰς κεφαλὰς ἀνόμων θάνατον· ἐξήγειρας δεσμούς (σου) ἕως τραχήλου εἰς τὸ τέλος.
**14** Διέκοψας ἐν ἐκστάσει κεφαλὰς δυναστῶν, σεισθήσονταί σε αὐτῇ· διανοίξουσι χαλινοὺς αὐτῶν, ὡς ἔσθων πτωχὸς λάθρᾳ.
**15** Καὶ ἐπεβίβασας εἰς θάλασσαν τοὺς ἵππους σου, ταράσσοντας ὕδατα πολλά.
**16** Ἐφυλαξάμην, καὶ ἐπτοήθη ἡ κοιλία μου ἀπὸ φωνῆς προσευχῆς χειλέων μου, καὶ εἰσῆλθε τρόμος εἰς τὰ ὀστᾶ μου, καὶ ὑποκάτωθεν μου ἐταράχθη ἡ ἕξις μου· ἀναπαύσομαι ἐν ἡμέρᾳ θλίψεώς μου, τοῦ ἀναβῆναί με εἰς λαὸν παροικίας μου.
**17** Διότι συκῆ οὐ καρποφορήσει, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται γεννήματα ἐν ταῖς ἀμπέλοις· ψεύσεται ἔργον ἐλαίας, καὶ τὰ πεδία

**The Sixth Ode: The Prayer of Habakkuk.**

**1.2** O Lord, I have heard Thy report, and I was afraid.
    O Lord, I have considered Thy works, and I was astonished.
    In the midst of two living creatures shalt Thou be known;
    When the years draw nigh, Thou shalt be made known;
    When the time is at hand, Thou shalt be revealed.
    When my soul is troubled, in wrath remember mercy.
**3** God shall come from Teman,
    And the Holy One from Mount Paran, shaded and woody.
    Selah.
    His glory hath covered the heavens,
    And the earth is full of His praise.
**4** And His radiance shall be as light;
    Beams of light are in His hands unto Him;
    And He hath established a mighty love of His strength.
**5** Before His face shall go forth a word,
    And it shall issue forth in the plains at His feet.
**6** He stood, and the earth was shaken;
    He looked, and the nations melted.
    And the mountains flowed away by force,
    The eternal hills melted by His eternal ways.
**7** Instead of toils, I saw the tents of the Ethiopians;
    And the tents of the land of Midian shall be terrified.
    Selah.
**8** Was it against the rivers, O Lord, that Thou wast wroth?
    Was Thy wrath against the rivers?
    Or Thy impetuous force against the sea?
    For Thou didst mount upon Thy horses,
    And Thy horsemanship is salvation.
**9** Drawing taut, Thou shalt draw taut Thy bow upon the scepters, saith the Lord.
    Selah.
**10** The earth shall be rent into rivers;
    Peoples shall see Thee and be in travail,
    Scattering the waters of His journey.
    The abyss gave forth its voice;
    The height of its appearance was raised.
**11** The sun and the moon stood still in their order;
    Thy arrows go forth into light,
    Into the brightness of the lightning of Thy weapons.
**12** By Thy threat Thou shalt diminish the earth,
    And in wrath Thou shalt cast down nations.
**13** Thou wentest forth for the salvation of Thy people,
    To save Thine anointed ones.
    Thou didst cast death upon the heads of the lawless;
    Thou didst raise up Thy bonds even to the neck, utterly.
**14** Thou didst cut off in astonishment the heads of the mighty ones;
    They shall be shaken [before] Thee by it;
    They shall open their bridles,
    As one eating a poor man secretly.
**15** And Thou didst make Thy horses tread into the sea,
    Troubling many waters.
**16** I kept watch, and my inwards were terrified
    At the sound of the prayer of my lips;
    And trembling entered into my bones,
    And from beneath me my frame was disturbed.
    I shall rest in the day of my tribulation,
    [For me] to go up to the people of my sojourning.
**17** Because the fig tree shall not bear fruit,
    And there shall be no produce in the vines;
    The labor of the olive tree shall fail,
    And the fields...
