**17** Ἰσραὴλ εἰς πῦρ, καὶ ἁγιάσει αὐτὸν ἐν πυρὶ καιομένῳ, καὶ φάγεται ὡσεὶ χόρτον τὴν ὕλην.
**18** Τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἀποσβεσθήσεται τὰ ὄρη, καὶ οἱ δρυμοὶ καὶ οἱ βουνοί, καὶ καταράγεται ἀπὸ ψυχῆς ἕως σαρκῶν· καὶ ἔσται ὁ φεύγων, ὡς ὁ φεύγων ἀπὸ φλογὸς καιομένης,
**19** καὶ οἱ καταλειφθέντες ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν ἔσονται ἀριθμός, καὶ παιδίον γράψει αὐτούς.
**20** Καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, οὐκέτι προστεθήσεται τὸ καταλειφθὲν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ οἱ σωθέντες τοῦ Ἰακὼβ οὐκέτι μὴ πεποιθότες ὦσιν ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀδικήσαντας αὐτούς,
**21** ἀλλ᾿ ἔσονται πεποιθότες ἐπὶ τὸν Θεὸν τὸν ἅγιον τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ τῇ ἀληθείᾳ· καὶ ἀναστρέψει τὸ καταλειφθὲν τοῦ Ἰακὼβ ἐπὶ Θεὸν ἰσχύοντα.
**22** Καὶ ἐὰν γένηται ὁ λαός σου Ἰσραὴλ ὡς ἡ ἄμμος τῆς θαλάσσης, τὸ κατάλειμμα σωθήσεται·
**23** λόγον γὰρ συντελῶν καὶ συντέμνων ἐν δικαιοσύνῃ, ὅτι λόγον συντετμημένον ποιήσει ὁ Θεὸς Κύριος τῶν δυνάμεων ἐν τῇ οἰκουμένῃ ὅλῃ.
**24** Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Κύριος Σαβαώθ· μὴ φοβοῦ ὁ λαός μου οἱ κατοικοῦντες ἐν Σιὼν ἀπὸ Ἀσσυρίων, ὅτι ἐν ῥάβδῳ πατάξει σε· πληγὴν γὰρ ἐπάγω ἐπὶ σέ, τοῦ ἰδεῖν ὁδὸν Αἴγυπτον.
**25** Ἔτι γὰρ μικρόν, καὶ παύσεται ἡ ὀργή, ὁ δὲ θυμός μου ἐπὶ τὴν βουλὴν αὐτῶν·
**26** καὶ ἐπεγερεῖ ὁ Θεὸς τῶν δυνάμεων ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς μάστιγας κατὰ τὴν πληγὴν τὴν Μαδιὰμ ἐν τόπῳ θλίψεως, καὶ ὁ θυμὸς αὐτοῦ τῇ ὁδῷ τῇ κατὰ θάλασσαν,
**27** εἰς τὴν ὁδὸν τὴν κατ᾿ Αἴγυπτον. Καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, ἀφαιρεθήσεται ὁ φόβος αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ σοῦ, καὶ ὁ ζυγὸς αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τοῦ ὤμου σου, καὶ καταφθαρήσεται ὁ ζυγὸς ἀπὸ τῶν ὤμων ὑμῶν.
**28** Ἤξει γὰρ εἰς τὴν πόλιν Ἀγγαί, καὶ παρελεύσεται εἰς Μαγεδδὼ, καὶ ἐν Μαχμὰς θήσει τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ· καὶ παρελεύσεται φάραγγα, καὶ ἥξει εἰς Ἀγγαί· φόβος λήψεται Ῥαμᾶ, πόλιν Σαοὺλ φεύξεται.
**30** Χρεμέτισον φωνήν σου, ἡ θυγάτηρ Γαλλείμ, ἐπακούσεται Λάϊσα, ἐπακούσεται ἐν Ἀναθώθ·
**31** ἐξέστη Μαδεβηνά, καὶ οἱ κατοικοῦντες Γιββεΐρ.
**32** Παρακαλεῖτε σήμερον ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ τοῦ μεῖναι· τῇ χειρὶ παρακαλεῖτε τὸ ὄρος τὴν θυγατέρα Σιών, καὶ οἱ βουνοὶ οἱ ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ·
**33** ἰδοὺ γὰρ ὁ δεσπότης Κύριος Σαβαώθ, συνταράσσει τοὺς ἐνδόξους μετὰ ἰσχύος, καὶ οἱ ὑψηλοὶ τῇ ὕβρει συντριβήσονται,
**34** καὶ ταπεινωθήσονται οἱ ὑψηλοί, καὶ πεσοῦνται ὑψηλοὶ μαχαίρᾳ· ὁ δὲ Λίβανος σὺν τοῖς ὑψηλοῖς πεσεῖται.

**17** Israel shall be for a fire, and He shall sanctify him in a burning fire, and shall consume the forest like unto grass.
**18** In that day shall the mountains be quenched, and the groves and the hills; and it shall be utterly broken from soul unto flesh. And the one fleeing shall be as one fleeing from a burning flame,
**19** and those that remain of them shall be a number, and a child shall write them down.
**20** And it shall be in that day, the remnant of Israel shall no longer be added [to their former ways], and those saved of Jacob shall in no wise again put their trust in those who wronged them,
**21** but they shall be trusting in the holy God of Israel in truth; and the remnant of Jacob shall return unto God, Who is mighty.
**22** And if thy people, O Israel, shall be as the sand of the sea, the remnant shall be saved;
**23** for He performeth a word, and cutteth it short in righteousness, because the Lord God of Hosts shall make a swift and decisive work throughout the whole inhabited earth.
**24** Therefore thus saith the Lord of Hosts: "Fear not, O My people that dwell in Zion, because of the Assyrians, for with a rod shall he smite thee; for I bring a stroke upon thee, that thou mightest behold the way of Egypt.
**25** For yet a little while, and the indignation shall cease, but My wrath shall be upon their counsel."
**26** And the God of Hosts shall raise up against them scourges, according to the slaughter of Midian in the place of affliction; and His wrath [shall come] by the way of the sea,
**27** even unto the way toward Egypt. And it shall be in that day, his fear shall be taken away from thee, and his yoke from off thy shoulder; and the yoke shall be utterly destroyed from off your shoulders.
**28** For he shall come to the city of Aggai, and shall pass through to Mageddo, and in Machmas shall he lay up his baggage; and he shall pass through a valley, and shall come to Aggai. Fear shall seize Ramah,
**29** the city of Saul shall flee.
**30** Neigh aloud with thy voice, O daughter of Gallim! Laisa shall hearken, Anathoth shall hearken!
**31** Madebena is dismayed, and the inhabitants of Gibbeir.
**32** Exhort ye today on the way to remain; with [your] hand exhort the mountain, the daughter of Zion, and the hills that are in Jerusalem.
**33** For behold, the Lord, the Master of Hosts, doth utterly confound the glorious with strength; and the high ones shall be utterly broken with insolence, and the high ones shall be humbled, and the high ones shall fall by the sword.
**34** And Lebanon shall fall with the high ones.
