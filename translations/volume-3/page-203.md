ΚΕΦ. ΙΓʹ. Η Σ Α Ι Α Σ 1141
ἀνθρώπου δειλιάσει, καὶ ταραχθήσονται οἱ πρέσβεις, καὶ ὠδῖνες **8**
αὐτοὺς ἕξουσιν, ὡς γυναικὸς τικτούσης· καὶ συμφράσουσιν ἕ-
τερος πρὸς τὸν ἕτερον, καὶ ἐστήσονται, καὶ τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτῶν
ὡς φλὸξ μεταβαλοῦσιν. Ἰδοὺ γὰρ ἡ ἡμέρα Κυρίου ἀνίατος ἔρ- **9**
χεται θυμοῦ καὶ ὀργῆς θεῖναι τὴν οἰκουμένην ἔρημον, καὶ τοὺς
ἁμαρτωλοὺς ἀπολέσαι ἐξ αὐτῆς. Οἱ γὰρ ἀστέρες τοῦ οὐρανοῦ **10**
καὶ ὁ Ὡρίων καὶ πᾶς ὁ κόσμος τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, τὸ φῶς αὐτῶν οὐ
δώσουσι· καὶ σκοτισθήσεται τοῦ ἡλίου ἀνατέλλοντος, καὶ ἡ σε-
λήνη οὐ δώσει τὸ φῶς αὐτῆς. Καὶ ἐντελοῦμαι τῇ οἰκουμένῃ ὅλῃ **11**
κακὰ, καὶ τοῖς ἀσεβέσι τὰς ἁμαρτίας αὐτῶν· καὶ ἀπολῶ ὕβριν
ἀνόμων, καὶ ὕβριν ὑπερφάνων ταπεινώσω. Καὶ ἔσονται οἱ κα- **12**
ταλελειμμένοι ἔντιμοι μᾶλλον ἢ τὸ χρυσίον τὸ ἄπυρον· καὶ ὁ
ἄνθρωπος μᾶλλον ἔντιμος ἔσται ἢ ὁ λίθος ὁ ἐκ σουφείρ. Ὁ γὰρ **13**
οὐρανὸς θυμωθήσεται, καὶ ἡ γῆ σεισθήσεται ἐκ τῶν θεμελίων
αὐτῆς, διὰ θυμὸν ὀργῆς Κυρίου Σαβαώθ, ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ᾗ ἂν ἐ-
πέλθῃ ὁ θυμὸς αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἔσονται οἱ καταλελειμμένοι ὡς τὸ δορ- **14**
κάδιον φεύγον, καὶ ὡς πρόβατον πλανώμενον, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ὁ
συνάγων, ὥστε ἄνθρωπον εἰς τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ ἀποστραφῆναι, καὶ ἄν-
θρωπον εἰς τὴν χώραν αὐτοῦ διῶξαι. Ὅς γὰρ ἐὰν ἁλῷ ἡττηθήσεται, **15**
καὶ ὅσοι συνηγμένοι εἰσί, μαχαίρᾳ πεσοῦνται. Καὶ τὰ τέκνα αὐτῶν **16**
ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν ῥάξουσι, καὶ τὰς οἰκίας αὐτῶν προνομεύσουσι,
καὶ τὰς γυναῖκας αὐτῶν ἕξουσιν. Ἰδοὺ ἐπεγείρω ὑμῖν τοὺς **17**
Μήδους, οἱ οὐ λογίζονται ἀργύριον, οὐδὲ χρυσίου χρείαν ἔχουσι.
Τοξεύματα νεανίσκων συντρίψουσι, καὶ τὰ τέκνα ὑμῶν οὐ μὴ ἐ- **18**
λεήσουσιν, οὐδὲ ἐπὶ τοῖς τέκνοις σου φείσονται οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτῶν.
Καὶ ἔσται Βαβυλὼν, ἡ καλεῖται ἔνδοξος ὑπὸ βασιλέως Χαλδαίων, **19**
ὃν τρόπον κατέστρεψεν ὁ Θεὸς Σόδομα καὶ Γόμορρα. Οὐ κατοικηθήσεται
εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα χρόνον, οὐδὲ μὴ εἰσέλθωσιν εἰς αὐτὴν **20**
διὰ πολλῶν γενεῶν, οὐδὲ μὴ διέλθωσιν αὐτὴν Ἄραβες, οὐδὲ ποι-
μένες οὐ μὴ ἀναπαύσονται ἐν αὐτῇ. Καὶ ἀναπαύσονται ἐκεῖ θηρία, **21**
καὶ πλησθήσονται οἰκίαι ἤχου, καὶ ἀναπαύσονται ἐκεῖ σειρῆνες,
καὶ δαιμόνια ἐκεῖ ὀρχήσονται, καὶ ὀνοκένταυροι ἐκεῖ κατοικήσουσι, **22**
καὶ νοσσοποιήσουσιν ἔχῖνοι ἐν τοῖς οἴκοις σπατάλης αὐτῶν. Ταχὺ
ἔρχεται, καὶ οὐ χρονιεῖ, καὶ αἱ ἡμέραι αὐτῆς οὐ μὴ ἐφελκυσθῶσιν.

**8** Every man shall be fearful, and the envoys shall be troubled; and pangs shall seize them as a woman travailing in childbirth. And they shall speak, one unto another, and shall stand [as if stunned], and their faces shall be changed as a flame.
**9** For behold, the day of the Lord cometh, a day incurable [in its affliction], with wrath and fierce anger, to make the whole inhabited earth desolate, and to destroy the sinners out of it.
**10** For the stars of heaven, and Orion, and all the host of heaven, shall not give their light; and the sun shall be darkened at its rising, and the moon shall not give her light.
**11** And I will command evils upon the whole inhabited earth, and [I will visit] their sins upon the impious; and I will destroy the insolence of the lawless, and the haughtiness of the arrogant will I humble.
**12** And the remnant shall be more precious than fine gold; and a man shall be more precious than the sapphire stone.
**13** For the heaven shall be wroth, and the earth shall be shaken from its foundations, because of the wrath of the Lord Sabaoth's fierce anger, in the day when His wrath shall come upon it.
**14** And it shall be that those who are left shall be as a fleeing gazelle, and as a sheep that wandereth astray; and there shall be none to gather [them], so that no man shall turn to his own people, nor shall any man flee to his own land.
**15** For whosoever is found, he shall be captured; and all those who are gathered shall fall by the sword.
**16** And their children shall be dashed down before their eyes; and their houses shall be plundered, and their wives shall be taken captive.
**17** Behold, I will stir up against you the Medes, who shall not regard silver, nor shall they have pleasure in gold.
**18** And with their bows shall they dash down the young men; and they shall have no pity upon your children, neither shall their eyes spare your children.
**19** And Babylon, which is called glorious by the king of the Chaldeans, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.
**20** It shall not be inhabited throughout all time, neither shall they enter into it for many generations; neither shall the Arabians pass through it, nor shall shepherds make their folds there.
**21** And wild beasts shall rest there, and their houses shall be filled with doleful sounds; and sirens shall rest there,
**22** and demons shall dance there, and onocentaurs shall dwell there, and hedgehogs shall make their nests in their luxurious houses. Quickly cometh [the day], and it shall not tarry, and her days shall not be prolonged.
