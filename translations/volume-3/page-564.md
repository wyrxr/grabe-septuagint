ΑΜΒΑΚΟΥΜ Αʹ.

ΚΕΦΑΛΑΙΟΝ Αʹ. I.

**1.** Το λῆμμα ὃ εἶδεν ᾿Αμβακοὺμ ὁ προφήτης.
**2.** ῞Εως τίνος, Κύριε, κεκράξομαι, καὶ οὐ μὴ εἰσακούσεις; βοησομαι πρὸς σὲ
    ἀδικούμενος, καὶ οὐ σώσεις;
**3.** ἵνατί μοι ἔδειξας κόπους καὶ πόνους ἐπιβλέπειν, ἐπὶ ταλαιπωρίαν καὶ ἀσέβειαν
    ἐξεναντίας μου.
**4.** Γέγονε κρίσις, καὶ ὁ κριτὴς λαμβάνει· διὰ τοῦτο διεσκέδασται νόμος, καὶ οὐ
    διεξάγεται εἰς τέλος κρῖμα· ὅτι ὁ ἀσεβὴς καταδυναστεύει τὸν δίκαιον, ἕνεκεν
    τούτου ἐξελεύσεται τὸ κρῖμα διεστραμμένον.
**5.** Ἴδετε οἱ καταφρονηταί, καὶ ἐπιβλέψατε, καὶ θαυμάσατε θαυμάσια, καὶ ἀφανίσθητε·
    διότι ἔργον ἐγὼ ἐργάζομαι ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ὑμῶν, ὃ οὐ μὴ πιστεύσητε, ἐάν τις
    ἐκδιηγῆται ὑμῖν.
**6.** Ὅτι ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐξεγείρω ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς τοὺς Χαλδαίους τοὺς μαχητὰς τὸ ἔθνος τὸ
    πικρόν, καὶ τὸ ταχινόν, τὸ πορευόμενον ἐπὶ τὰ πλάτη τῆς γῆς, τοῦ κατακληρονομῆσαι
    σκηνώματα οὐκ αὐτοῦ·
**7.** φοβερὸς καὶ ἐπιφανὴς ἐστιν, ἐξ αὐτοῦ τὸ κρῖμα αὐτοῦ ἔσται, καὶ τὸ λῆμμα αὐτοῦ
    ἐξ αὐτοῦ ἐξελεύσεται·
**8.** καὶ ἐξαλλοῦνται ὑπὲρ παρδάλεις οἱ ἵπποι αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὀξύτεροι ὑπὲρ τοὺς λύκους
    τῆς ᾿Αραβίας· καὶ ἐξιππάσονται οἱ ἱππεῖς αὐτοῦ, καὶ δραμοῦσι μακρόθεν, καὶ
    πετασθήσονται ὡς ἀετὸς πρόθυμος εἰς τὸ φαγεῖν.
**9.** Συντέλεια ἐπ᾿ ἀσεβεῖς ἥξει, ἀνθεστηκότας προσώποις αὐτῶν ἐξεναντίας, καὶ
    συνάξει ὡς ἄμμον αἰχμαλωσίαν.
**10.** Καὶ αὐτὸς ἐν βασιλεῦσιν ἐντρυφήσει, καὶ τύραννοι παίγνια αὐτοῦ, καὶ αὐτὸς εἰς
    πᾶν ὀχύρωμα ἐμπαίζεται, καὶ βαλεῖ χῶμα, καὶ κρατήσει αὐτοῦ·
**11.** τότε μεταβαλεῖ τὸ πνεῦμα, καὶ διελεύσεται, καὶ ἐξιλάσεται· αὕτη ἡ ἰσχὺς τῷ
    Θεῷ μου.
**12.** Οὐχί σὺ ἀπ᾿ ἀρχῆς Κύριε ὁ Θεός μου, ὁ ἅγιός μου; καὶ οὐ μὴ ἀποθάνωμεν.
    Κύριε, εἰς κρῖμα τέταχας αὐτὸν, καὶ ἔπλασέ με τοῦ ἐλέγχειν παιδείαν αὐτοῦ.
**13.** Καθαρὸς ὀφθαλμός σου τοῦ μὴ ὁρᾶν πονηρὰ, καὶ ἐπιβλέπειν ἐπὶ πόνους οὐ
    δυνήσῃ· εἰς τί ἐπιβλέπεις ἐπὶ καταφρονοῦντας; παρασιώπηση ἐν τῷ καταπίνειν
    ἀσεβὴ τὸν δίκαιον;
**14.** Καὶ

**HABAKKUK**
**CHAPTER 1**

**1** The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.

**2** How long, O Lord, shall I cry, and Thou wilt not hear? Even unto Thee will I cry, saying, "I am wronged," and Thou wilt not save?

**3** Wherefore hast Thou shown me troubles and pains to look upon, yea, even upon misery and impiety before my face?

**4** For judgment hath come to be, and the judge receiveth [bribes]; therefore is the Law dispersed, and judgment is not brought forth unto its end. For the impious doth oppress the righteous; because of this, judgment shall go forth perverted.

**5** Behold, ye despisers, and look, and be utterly amazed, and perish! For a work do I work in your days, which ye shall in no wise believe, though one should declare it unto you.

**6** For behold, I raise up against you the Chaldeans, that bitter and swift nation of warriors, which doth march upon the breadths of the earth, to inherit dwellings that are not its own.

**7** Terrible and eminent is it; from itself shall its judgment be, and its decree shall proceed from itself.

**8** And its horses do leap forth swifter than leopards, and are keener than the wolves of Arabia; and its horsemen shall ride forth, and they shall run from afar, and shall fly as an eagle eager to devour.

**9** Utter destruction shall come upon the impious, their faces [being] set forth as adversaries; and it shall gather captives as the sand.

**10** And it shall make sport of kings, and tyrants shall be its scorn; yea, it shall mock at every stronghold, and shall cast up a mound, and shall take it.

**11** Then shall his spirit change, and he shall pass on, and make propitiation; [but] this might [belongs] unto my God.

**12** Art Thou not from the beginning, O Lord my God, my Holy One? And we shall not die. O Lord, Thou hast appointed him for judgment, and hast formed me to reprove his discipline.

**13** Thou art of pure eyes, so as not to behold evil, and to look upon pains Thou canst not. Wherefore then dost Thou look upon despisers? Wilt Thou be silent when the impious doth swallow up the righteous?

**14** And...
