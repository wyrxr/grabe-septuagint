καὶ φοίνικες κατὰ τὴν γλυφὴν τῶν ἁγίων, καὶ σπουδαῖα ξύλα
κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ Αἰλὰμ ἔξωθεν, καὶ θυρίδες κρυπταί· Καὶ διε- 26
μέτρησεν ἔνθεν καὶ ἔνθεν, εἰς τὰ ὀροφώματα τοῦ Αἰλὰμ, καὶ
τὰ πλευρὰ τοῦ οἴκου ἐξυλωμένα.

ΚΑΙ εἰσήγαγέ με εἰς τὴν αὐλὴν τὴν ἐξωτέραν κατὰ ἀνατο- 1
λὰς, κατέναντι τῆς πύλης τῆς πρὸς βορρᾶν, καὶ εἰσήγαγέ με,
καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐξέδραι δεκαπέντε, ἐχόμεναι τοῦ ἀπολοίπου, καὶ ἐχό-
μεναι τοῦ διορίζοντος πρὸς βορρᾶν, κατὰ πρόσωπον ἐπὶ πήχεις 2
ἑκατὸν μῆκος θύραν πρὸς βορρᾶν, καὶ τὸ πλάτος πεντήκοντα
πήχεων· διαγεγραμμέναι ὃν τρόπον αἱ πύλαι τῆς αὐλῆς τῆς ἐσω- 3
τέρας, καὶ ὃν τρόπον τὰ περίστυλα τῆς αὐλῆς τῆς ἐξωτέρας ἐ-
στιχισμέναι, ἀντιπρόσωποι στοαὶ τρισσαὶ, καὶ κατέναντι τῶν 4
ἐξεδρῶν περίπατος πηχῶν δέκα τὸ πλάτος, ἐπὶ πήχεις ἑκατὸν
τὸ μῆκος, εἰς τὸ ἐσώτερον ὀδὸν πήχεως ἑνὸς, καὶ τὰ θυρώματα
αὐτῶν πρὸς βορρᾶν, καὶ οἱ περίπατοι οἱ ὑπερῷοι ὡσαύτως· ὅτι 5
ἐξείχετο τὸ περίστυλον ἐξ αὐτοῦ, ἐκ τοῦ ὑποκάτωθεν περιστύ-
λου, καὶ τὸ διάστημα· οὕτως περίστυλον καὶ διάστημα, καὶ οὕ- 6
τως στοαί· διότι τριπλαῖ ἦσαν, καὶ στύλους οὐκ εἶχον καθὼς
οἱ στύλοι τῶν ἐξωτέρων· διὰ τοῦτο ἐξείχοντο τῶν ὑποκάτωθεν
καὶ τῶν μέσων ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς. Καὶ φῶς ἔξωθεν, ὃν τρόπον (καὶ) 7
αἱ ἐξέδραι ὁδὸς τῆς αὐλῆς τῆς ἐξωτέρας, αἱ βλέπουσαι ἀπέναντι
τῶν ἐξεδρῶν τῶν πρὸς βορρᾶν, μῆκος πήχεων πεντήκοντα. Ὅτι 8
τὸ μῆκος τῶν ἐξεδρῶν τῶν βλεπουσῶν εἰς τὴν αὐλὴν τὴν ἐξω-
τέραν ἦν πήχεων πεντήκοντα, καὶ αὗται εἰσιν ἀντιπρόσωποι ταύ-
ταις· τὸ πᾶν πήχεων ἑκατόν. Καὶ αἱ θύραι τῶν ἐξεδρῶν τούτων, 9
τῆς εἰσόδου τῆς πρὸς ἀνατολὰς, τοῦ εἰσπορεύεσθαι δι’ αὐτῶν ἐκ
τῆς αὐλῆς τῆς ἐξωτέρας, κατὰ τὸ φῶς τοῦ ἐν ἀρχῇ τοῦ περιπάτου· 10
καὶ τὰ πρὸς νότον κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ νότου, κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ
ἀπολοίπου, καὶ κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ διορίζοντος, καὶ αἱ ἐξέδραι,
καὶ ὁ περίπατος κατὰ πρόσωπον αὐτῶν, κατὰ τὰ μέτρα τῶν ἐξε- 11
δρῶν τῶν πρὸς βορρᾶν, κατὰ τὸ μῆκος αὐτῶν, καὶ κατὰ τὸ εὖρος
αὐτῶν, καὶ κατὰ πάσας τὰς ἐξόδους αὐτῶν, καὶ κατὰ πάσας
τὰς ἐπιστροφὰς αὐτῶν, καὶ κατὰ τὰ φῶτα αὐτῶν, καὶ κατὰ

**Ezekiel 41**
26 And [there were] palm-trees according to the carving of the holy [chambers], and choice woods before the Ailam without, and hidden windows; And he measured on this side and on that side, unto the ceilings of the Ailam, and the sides of the house were paneled [with wood].

**Ezekiel 42**
1 Moreover, he brought me forth into the outer court by the way toward the east, over against the gate that looked toward the north; and he brought me [in],
2 and lo, there were fifteen chambers, adjoining the remaining space, and adjoining the separating structure toward the north, [extending] opposite [the gate] for a hundred cubits in length, [with] a door toward the north, and the breadth [thereof was] fifty cubits.
3 Delineated in the same manner as the gates of the inner court, and arranged in like manner as the colonnades of the outer court, [with] three porticoes facing one another.
4 And over against the chambers, a walk of ten cubits in breadth, for a hundred cubits in length; into the inner [part was] a way of one cubit, and their doorways [were] toward the north.
5 And the upper walks [were] likewise. For the colonnade projected from it, even from the lower colonnade, and [so did] the interspace;
6 Thus [there was] colonnade and interspace, and thus [were] the porticoes; for they were triple, and had no pillars like unto the pillars of the outer [chambers]; therefore they projected from the lower [story] and from the middle [story] from the ground.
7 And there was an opening for light without, in such wise (even) as the chambers [that formed] the way of the outer court, which looked over against the chambers toward the north, [their] length [being] fifty cubits.
8 For the length of the chambers that looked into the outer court was fifty cubits; and these [chambers] were opposite to those; the total [length being] a hundred cubits.
9 And the doors of these chambers, of the entrance that was toward the east, [were] for going in through them from the outer court, according to the opening for light that was at the beginning of the walk;
10 And those toward the south [were situated] over against the south, over against the remaining space, and over against the separating structure, and the chambers, and the walk over against them,
11 According to the measurements of the chambers toward the north, according to their length, and according to their breadth, and according to all their exits, and according to all their turnings, and according to their openings for light; and according to
