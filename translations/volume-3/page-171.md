στίᾳ. Ὥσπερ γὰρ παρεγένετο, οὕτως καὶ ἀπελεύσεται· καὶ τίς ἡ
περίσσεια αὐτῷ ἢ μοχθεῖ εἰς ἄνεμον; Καί γε πᾶσαι αἱ ἡμέραι 16
αὐτοῦ ἐν σκότει, καὶ ἐν πένθει, καὶ θυμῷ πολλῷ, καὶ ἀρρωστίᾳ,
καὶ χόλῳ. Ἰδοὺ δὲ ἴδον ἐγὼ ἀγαθόν, ὃ ἔστι καλόν, τοῦ φαγεῖν καὶ 17
τοῦ πιεῖν, καὶ τοῦ ἰδεῖν ἀγαθωσύνην ἐν παντὶ μόχθῳ αὐτοῦ, ᾧ
ἐὰν μοχθήσῃ ὑπὸ τὸν ἥλιον ἀριθμὸν ἡμερῶν ζωῆς αὐτοῦ, ὧν ἔδω-
κεν αὐτῷ ὁ Θεός· ὅτι αὐτὸ μερὶς αὐτοῦ. Καί γε πᾶς ἄνθρωπος 18
ᾧ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ ὁ Θεὸς πλοῦτον καὶ ὑπάρχοντα, καὶ ἐξουσίασεν
αὐτῷ τοῦ φαγεῖν ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ λαβεῖν τὸ μέρος αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοῦ
εὐφρανθῆναι ἐν μόχθῳ αὐτοῦ, τοῦτο δόμα Θεοῦ ἐστιν· ὅτι οὐ πολ- 19
λὰ μνησθήσεται τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς ζωῆς αὐτοῦ, ὅτι ὁ Θεὸς περισπᾷ
αὐτὸν ἐν εὐφροσύνῃ καρδίας αὐτοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. ϛ´. VI.

Ἔστι πονηρία ἣν εἶδον ὑπὸ τὸν ἥλιον, καὶ πολλὴ ἐστιν ἐπὶ 1
τὸν ἄνθρωπον· ἀνὴρ ᾧ δώσει αὐτῷ ὁ Θεὸς πλοῦτον καὶ ὑπάρχοντα 2
καὶ δόξαν, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ὑστερῶν τῇ ψυχῇ αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ παντὸς
οὗ ἐπιθυμήσει, καὶ οὐκ ἐξουσίασεν αὐτῷ ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ φαγεῖν ἀπ᾿ αὐ-
τοῦ, ὅτι ἀνὴρ ξένος φάγεται αὐτόν· (καὶ γε) τοῦτο ματαιότης καὶ
ἀρρωστία πονηρά ἐστιν. Ἐὰν γεννήσῃ ἀνὴρ ἑκατόν, καὶ ἔτη πολ- 3
λὰ ζήσεται, καὶ πλῆθος ὅτι ἔσονται αἱ ἡμέραι ἐτῶν αὐτοῦ, καὶ
ἡ ψυχὴ αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἐμπλησθήσεται ἀπὸ ἀγαθωσύνης, καὶ γε ταφὴ
οὐκ ἐγένετο αὐτῷ, εἶπα ἀγαθὸν ὑπὲρ αὐτὸν τὸ ἔκτρωμα· ὅτι ἐν 4
ματαιότητι ἦλθε, καὶ ἐν σκότει πορεύσεται, καὶ ἐν σκότει ὄνομα
αὐτοῦ καλυφθήσεται, καὶ γε ἥλιον οὐκ εἶδε, καὶ οὐκ ἔγνω, ἀνά- 5
παυσις τούτῳ ὑπὲρ τοῦτον, καὶ εἰ ἔζησεν χιλίων ἐτῶν καθόδους, 6
καὶ ἀγαθωσύνην οὐκ εἶδε· μὴ οὐκ εἰς τόπον ἕνα τὰ πάντα πορεύε-
ται; Πᾶς μόχθος τοῦ ἀνθρώπου εἰς στόμα αὐτοῦ, καὶ γε ἡ ψυ- 7
χὴ οὐ πληρωθήσεται. Ὅτι τίς περίσσεια τῷ σοφῷ ὑπὲρ τὸν ἄφρο- 8
να; Διατὶ ὁ πένης οἶδε πορευθῆναι κατέναντι τῆς ζωῆς; Ἀγαθὸν 9
ὄραμα ὀφθαλμῶν ὑπὲρ πορευόμενον ψυχῇ· καὶ γε τοῦτο ματαιότης
καὶ προαίρεσις πνεύματος. Εἴ τι ἐγένετο, ἤδη κέκληται ὄνομα αὐ- 10
τοῦ, καὶ ἐγνώσθη ὅ ἐστιν ἄνθρωπος, καὶ οὐ δυνήσεται τοῦ κριθῆ-
ναι μετὰ τοῦ ἰσχυροῦ ὑπὲρ αὐτόν· ὅτι εἰσὶ λόγοι πολλοὶ πληθύ- 11
νοντες ματαιότητα.

**CHAPTER 5**

**15** misery. For as he came forth, so shall he also depart; and what advantage hath he,
    that he laboureth for the wind?
**16** And verily, all his days are in darkness, and in mourning,
    and in much wrath, and in sickness, and in bitterness.
**17** Behold, I have seen a good [thing], and that which is comely:
    to eat and to drink, and to behold good in all his labour,
    wherein he laboureth under the sun, [for] the number of the days of his life which God hath given him;
    for this is his portion.
**18** And verily, every man unto whom God hath given wealth and possessions,
    and hath granted him power to eat thereof, and to receive his portion,
    and to rejoice in his labour—this is the gift of God.
**19** For he shall not much remember the days of his life,
    because God occupieth him with the joy of his heart.

**CHAPTER 6**

**1** There is an evil which I have seen under the sun,
    and it is great upon man:
**2** A man to whom God shall give wealth, and possessions, and glory,
    so that his soul lacketh nothing of all that he desireth,
    yet God hath not given him power to eat thereof, but a stranger shall eat it;
    (and verily) this is vanity and a grievous sickness.
**3** If a man beget an hundred [children], and live many years,
    and the number of his years' days be great,
    and his soul be not satisfied with good,
    and verily, no burial was made for him,
    then I say that the untimely birth is better than he;
**4** For it came in vanity, and in darkness shall it depart,
    and in darkness its name shall be covered.
**5** And verily, it hath not seen the sun, neither hath it known [aught];
    rest is better for this one than for that one.
**6** And though he lived [for] a thousand years' descents, and saw no good;
    do not all things go unto one place?
**7** All the labour of man is for his mouth,
    and verily his soul shall not be satisfied.
**8** For what advantage hath the wise man above the fool?
    Why doth the poor man know how to walk in the presence of life?
**9** Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the soul;
    and verily, this also is vanity and a vexation of spirit.
**10** Whatever hath been, its name hath already been called,
    and it is known what man is;
    and he shall not be able to contend with the Mighty One above him.
**11** For there are many words that multiply vanity.
