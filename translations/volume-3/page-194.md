ΚΕΦ. ϛʹ. VI.

8   καὶ τὰς ἁμαρτίας σου περικαθαριεῖ. Καὶ ἤκουσα τῆς φωνῆς Κυρίου
    λέγοντος· τίνα ἀποστείλω, καὶ τίς πορεύσεται πρὸς τὸν λαὸν
9   τοῦτον; καὶ εἶπα· ἰδοὺ εἰμι ἐγώ· ἀπόστειλόν με. Καὶ εἶπε· πο-
    ρεύθητι, καὶ εἰπὸν τῷ λαῷ τούτῳ· ἀκοῇ ἀκούσετε, καὶ οὐ μὴ
10  συνῆτε, καὶ βλέποντες βλέψετε, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἴδητε· ἐπαχύνθη γὰρ ἡ
    καρδία τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου, καὶ τοῖς ὠσὶν αὐτῶν βαρέως ἤκουσαν,
    καὶ τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτῶν ἐκάμμυσαν, μήποτε ἴδωσι τοῖς ὀφθαλ-
    μοῖς, καὶ τοῖς ὠσὶν ἀκούσωσι, καὶ τῇ καρδίᾳ συνῶσι καὶ ἐπιστρέ-
11  ψωσι, καὶ ἰάσομαι αὐτούς. Καὶ εἶπα· ἕως πότε Κύριε; Καὶ εἶπεν.
    ἕως ἂν ἐρημωθῶσι πόλεις παρὰ τὸ μὴ κατοικεῖσθαι, καὶ οἶκοι
    παρὰ τὸ μὴ εἶναι ἀνθρώπους, καὶ ἡ γῆ καταλειφθήσεται ἔρημος·
12  Καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα μακρυνεῖ ὁ Θεὸς τοὺς ἀνθρώπους, καὶ οἱ κατα-
13  λειφθέντες πληθυνθήσονται ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἔτι ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς ἔσται
    τὸ ἐπιδέκατον, καὶ πάλιν ἔσται εἰς προνομὴν ὡς τερέβινθος, καὶ
    ὡς βάλανος ὅταν ἐκπέσῃ ἐκ τῆς θήκης αὐτῆς· σπέρμα ἅγιον
    τὸ στήλωμα αὐτῆς.

### Chapter 7

1   ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ῎Αχαζ τοῦ ᾿Ιωάθαμ τοῦ υἱοῦ
    ᾿Οζίου βασιλέως ᾿Ιούδα, ἀνέβη ῾Ρασσὼν βασιλεὺς ᾿Αρὰμ καὶ
2   Φακεὲ υἱὸς ῾Ρομελίου βασιλεὺς ᾿Ισραὴλ ἐπὶ ῾Ιερουσαλὴμ πολε-
    μῆσαι αὐτήν, καὶ οὐκ ἠδυνήθησαν πολιορκῆσαι αὐτήν. Καὶ ἀνηγ-
    γέλη εἰς τὸν οἶκον Δαυίδ, λέγοντες· συνωμόγησεν ᾿Αρὰμ πρὸς
3   τὸν ᾿Εφραίμ, καὶ ἐξέστη ἡ ψυχὴ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἡ ψυχὴ τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ,
    ὅν τρόπον ἐν δρυμῷ ξύλον ὑπὸ πνεύματος σαλευθῇ. Καὶ
    εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς ῾Ησαΐαν· ἔξελθε εἰς συνάντησιν ῎Αχαζ, σὺ καὶ
4   ὁ καταλειφθεὶς ᾿Ιασοὺβ ὁ υἱός σου πρὸς τὴν κολυμβήθραν τῆς
    ἄνω ὁδοῦ τοῦ ἀγροῦ τοῦ γναφέως, καὶ ἐρεῖς αὐτῷ· φύλαξαι
5   τοῦ ἡσυχάσαι, καὶ μὴ φοβοῦ, μηδὲ ἡ ψυχή σου ἀσθενείτω ἀπὸ
    τῶν δύο ξύλων τῶν δαλῶν τῶν καπνιζομένων τούτων· ὅταν γὰρ
6   ὀργὴ τοῦ θυμοῦ μου γένηται, πάλιν ἰάσομαι. Καὶ ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ᾿Αρὰμ
    καὶ ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ῾Ρομελίου, ὅτι ἐβουλεύσαντο βουλὴν πονηρὰν
7   περὶ σοῦ, ᾿Εφραὶμ καὶ ὁ υἱὸς ῾Ρωμελίου, λέγοντες· ἀναβησόμεθα
    εἰς τὴν ᾿Ιουδαίαν, καὶ συλλαλῆσαντες αὐτοῖς ἀποστρέψωμεν αὐτοὺς
    πρὸς ἡμᾶς, καὶ βασιλεύσομεν αὐτῆς τὸν υἱὸν Ταβεήλ. Τάδε λέγει

**8** And thine iniquities shall be taken away,
And thy sins shall be purged thoroughly.
And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying,
"Whom shall I send, and who will go for this people?"
**9** Then said I, "Behold, here am I; send me."
And He said, "Go, and say unto this people:
'By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand;
And seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:'
**10** For the heart of this people is waxed fat,
And with their ears they have heard heavily,
And their eyes have they closed;
Lest they should see with their eyes,
And hear with their ears,
And understand with their heart,
And turn [unto Me], and I should heal them."
**11** Then said I, "Lord, how long?"
And He answered, "Until cities be made waste,
So that there be no inhabitant,
And houses be without men,
And the land shall be left desolate;
**12** And after these things shall God remove the men far off,
And they that are left shall be multiplied upon the earth.
**13** And yet in it shall be a tenth,
And again it shall be for a spoil,
As a terebinth, and as an acorn when it falleth from its husk;
A holy seed [shall be] its steadfast trunk."

### Chapter 7

**1** And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham,
The son of Uzziah, king of Judah,
That Rezin, king of Aram,
And Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel,
Went up unto Jerusalem to war against it,
But they were not able to besiege it.
**2** And it was told unto the house of David, saying,
"Aram is confederate with Ephraim."
And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people,
**3** Even as the trees of the forest are shaken by the wind.
Then said the Lord unto Isaiah,
"Go forth to meet Ahaz,
Thou and Jashub thy son, who remaineth,
At the conduit of the upper way of the fuller's field;
**4** And say unto him, 'Take heed, and be quiet;
Fear not, neither let thy heart faint
Because of these two pieces of smoking firebrands;'
**5** For when the wrath of My fury cometh, I will heal again.
And the son of Aram and the son of Remaliah,
Because they have counselled an evil counsel against thee,
**6** [Even] Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, saying,
'Let us go up against Judah,
And having spoken with them, let us turn them unto us,
And let us make the son of Tabeel king in the midst of her.'
**7** Thus saith the Lord of Sabaoth:
