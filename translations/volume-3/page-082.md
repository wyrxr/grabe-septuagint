21 Οὐκ ἐμνήσθησαν Θεοῦ τοῦ σώζοντος αὐτούς, τοῦ ποιήσαντος μεγαλεῖα ἐν
22 Αἰγύπτῳ, θαυμάσια ἐν γῇ Χάμ, φοβερὰ ἐπὶ θαλάσσης ἐρυθρᾶς.
23 Καὶ εἶπε τοῦ ἐξολεθρεῦσαι αὐτούς, εἰ μὴ Μωυσῆς ὁ ἐκλεκτὸς αὐ-
    τοῦ ἔστη ἐν τῇ θραύσει ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ, τοῦ ἀποστρέψαι τὸν θυμὸν
24 αὐτοῦ, τοῦ μὴ ἐξολεθρεῦσαι αὐτούς. Καὶ ἐξουδένωσαν γῆν ἐπιθυ-
25 μητήν, οὐκ ἐπίστευσαν τῷ λόγῳ αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐγόγγυσαν ἐν τοῖς
26 σκηνώμασιν αὐτῶν, οὐκ εἰσήκουσαν τῆς φωνῆς Κυρίου. Καὶ ἐπῆρε
    τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἐπ᾿ αὐτούς, τοῦ καταβαλεῖν αὐτοὺς ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ,
27 καὶ τοῦ καταβαλεῖν τὸ σπέρμα αὐτῶν ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι, καὶ διασκορ-
28 πίσαι αὐτοὺς ἐν ταῖς χώραις. Καὶ ἐτελέσθησαν τῷ Βεελφεγώρ,
29 καὶ ἔφαγον θυσίας νεκρῶν· καὶ παρώξυναν αὐτὸν ἐν τοῖς ἐπιτηδεύ-
30 μασιν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπληθύνθη ἐν αὐτοῖς ἡ πτῶσις. Καὶ ἔστη Φι-
31 νεὲς καὶ ἐξιλάσατο, καὶ ἐκόπασεν ἡ θραῦσις· καὶ ἐλογίσθη αὐτῷ
32 εἰς δικαιοσύνην, εἰς γενεὰν καὶ γενεὰν ἕως τοῦ αἰῶνος. Καὶ παρ-
    ώργισαν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ ὕδατος ἀντιλογίας, καὶ ἐκακώθη Μωυσῆς δι᾿ αὐ-
33 τούς· ὅτι παρεπίκραναν τὸ πνεῦμα αὐτοῦ, καὶ διέστειλεν ἐν τοῖς
34 χείλεσιν αὐτοῦ. Οὐκ ἐξωλέθρευσαν τὰ ἔθνη ἃ εἶπε Κύριος αὐτοῖς,
35.36 καὶ ἐμίγησαν ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι, καὶ ἔμαθον τὰ ἔργα αὐτῶν· καὶ ἐδού-
    λευσαν τοῖς γλυπτοῖς αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐγενήθη αὐτοῖς εἰς σκάνδαλον.
37 Καὶ ἔθυσαν τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτῶν καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας αὐτῶν τοῖς δαι-
38 μονίοις· καὶ ἐξέχεαν αἷμα ἀθῶον, αἷμα υἱῶν αὐτῶν καὶ θυγατέ-
    ρων αὐτῶν, ὧν ἔθυσαν τοῖς γλυπτοῖς Χαναάν. Καὶ ἐφονεύθη
39 ἡ γῆ ἐν τοῖς αἵμασιν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐμιάνθη ἐν τοῖς ἔργοις αὐ-
40 τῶν· καὶ ἐπόρνευσαν ἐν τοῖς ἐπιτηδεύμασιν αὐτῶν. Καὶ ὠργίσθη
    θυμῷ Κύριος ἐπὶ τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐβδελύξατο τὴν κληρονο-
41 μίαν αὐτοῦ· καὶ παρέδωκεν αὐτοὺς εἰς χεῖρας ἐθνῶν, καὶ ἐκυ-
42 ρίευσαν αὐτῶν οἱ μισοῦντες αὐτούς. Καὶ ἔθλιψαν αὐτοὺς οἱ ἐχθροὶ
43 αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐταπεινώθησαν ὑπὸ τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν. Πλεονάκις ἐῤῥύ-
    σατο αὐτούς· αὐτοὶ δὲ παρεπίκραναν αὐτὸν ἐν τῇ βουλῇ αὐ-
44 τῶν, καὶ ἐταπεινώθησαν ἐν ταῖς ἀνομίαις αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἴδε (Κύ-
    ριος) ἐν τῷ θλίβεσθαι αὐτούς, ἐν τῷ αὐτὸν εἰσακοῦσαι τῆς δεή-
45 σεως αὐτῶν· καὶ ἐμνήσθη τῆς διαθήκης αὐτοῦ, καὶ μετεμελήθη
46 κατὰ τὸ πλῆθος τοῦ ἐλέους αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτοὺς εἰς οἰκτιρ-
47 μοὺς ἐναντίον πάντων τῶν αἰχμαλωτισάντων αὐτούς. Σῶσον ἡμᾶς
    Κύριε ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν, καὶ ἐπισυνάγαγε ἡμᾶς ἐκ τῶν ἐθνῶν, τοῦ
    ἐξομολογήσασθαι τῷ ὀνόματί σου τῷ ἁγίῳ, τοῦ ἐγκαυχᾶσθαι ἐν

**PSALM CV.** (continued)

21 They remembered not God their Savior,
    Who had done great things in Egypt,
22 Wondrous works in the land of Ham,
    And fearful deeds by the Red Sea.
23 And He said that He would destroy them,
    Had not Moses, His chosen, stood in the breach before Him,
    To turn away His fury, lest He should destroy them.
24 And they disdained the desirable land;
    They believed not His word.
25 But murmured in their tents,
    And hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord.
26 Then He lifted up His hand against them,
    To cast them down in the wilderness;
27 And to cast down their seed among the nations,
    And to scatter them in the lands.
28 And they consecrated themselves unto Baal-peor,
29 And ate the sacrifices of the dead;
    And they provoked Him with their practices,
    And the plague grew rife among them.
30 Then stood up Phinehas, and made atonement,
    And the destruction ceased;
31 And that was counted unto him for righteousness,
    Unto generation upon generation, even unto the age everlasting.
32 And they provoked Him at the waters of contention,
    So that Moses suffered for their sakes;
33 For they embittered his spirit,
    And he spake rashly with his lips.
34 They destroyed not the nations,
    Concerning which the Lord had spoken unto them;
35 But mingled themselves with the nations,
    And learned their works.
36 And served their graven images,
    Which became a snare unto them.
37 Yea, they sacrificed their sons
    And their daughters unto demons;
38 And shed innocent blood,
    Even the blood of their sons and of their daughters,
    Whom they sacrificed unto the graven images of Canaan.
    And the land was stained with their blood,
39 And defiled with their works;
40 And they prostituted themselves in their practices.
    Then the Lord was wroth with His people,
    And abhorred His inheritance;
41 And He delivered them into the hands of the nations,
    And they that hated them ruled over them.
42 And their enemies oppressed them,
    And they were humbled under their hands.
43 Many times did He deliver them;
    But they provoked Him with their counsel,
    And were brought low by their iniquities.
44 Nevertheless, [the Lord] looked upon [them] in their tribulation,
    When He heard their supplication;
45 And He remembered His covenant,
    And relented according to the multitude of His mercy.
46 And He caused them to be regarded with compassion
    By all those who had led them captive.
47 Save us, O Lord our God,
    And gather us from among the nations,
    That we may give thanks unto Thy holy Name,
    [And] that we may glory in
