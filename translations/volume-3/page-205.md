ΚΕΦ. ΙΔʹ.
ἔλυσεν εἰς τὰς οἰκίας αὐτῶν. Πάντες οἱ βασιλεῖς τῶν ἐθνῶν ἐκοιμή- 18
θησαν ἐν τιμῇ, ἕκαστος ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ. Σὺ δὲ ῥιφήσῃ ἐν τοῖς 19
ὄρεσιν, ὡς νεκρὸς ἐβδελυγμένος μετὰ πολλῶν τεθνηκότων ἐκκε-
κεντημένων μαχαίραις, καταδαινόντων εἰς ᾅδου· ὃν τρόπον ἐν αἵ-
ματι ἱματίον πεφυρμένον οὐκ ἔσται καθαρόν, οὕτως οὐδὲ σὺ ἔσῃ 20
καθαρός· διότι τὴν γῆν μου ἀπώλεσας, καὶ τὸν λαόν μου ἀπέ-
κτεινας· οὐ μὴ μείνῃς εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα χρόνον, σπέρμα πονηρόν.
Ἑτοίμασον σφαγῆναι τὰ τέκνα σου ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις τοῦ πατρὸς 21
αὐτῶν, ἵνα μὴ ἀναστῶσι, καὶ τὴν γῆν κληρονομήσωσι, καὶ ἐμ-
πλήσωσι τὴν γῆν πολέμων. Καὶ ἐπαναστήσομαι αὐτοῖς, λέγει 22
Κύριος Σαβαώθ, καὶ ἀπολῶ αὐτῶν ὄνομα, καὶ κατάλειμμα, καὶ
σπέρμα· τάδε λέγει Κύριος. Καὶ θήσω τὴν Βαβυλωνίαν ἔρημον, 23
ὥστε κατοικεῖν ἐχίνους, καὶ ἔσται εἰς οὐδέν· καὶ θήσω αὐτὴν πηλοῦ
βάραθρον εἰς ἀπώλειαν. Τάδε λέγει Κύριος Σαβαώθ· ὃν τρόπον 24
εἴρηκα, οὕτως ἔσται, καὶ ὃν τρόπον βεβούλευμαι, οὕτως μενεῖ,
τοῦ ἀπολέσαι τοὺς Ἀσσυρίους ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς τῆς ἐμῆς, καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν 25
ὀρέων μου· καὶ ἔσονται εἰς κατάπατημα, καὶ ἀφαιρεθήσεται ἀπ᾿
αὐτῶν ὁ ζυγὸς αὐτῶν, καὶ τὸ κῦδος αὐτῶν ἀπὸ τῶν ὤμων αὐτῶν
ἀφαιρεθήσεται. Αὕτη ἡ βουλὴ, ἣν βεβούλευται Κύριος ἐπὶ τὴν οἰ- 26
κουμένην ὅλην, καὶ αὕτη ἡ χεὶρ ἡ ὑψηλὴ ἐπὶ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη τῆς
οἰκουμένης. Ἃ γὰρ ὁ Θεὸς ὁ ἅγιος βεβούλευται τίς διασκεδάσει; 27
καὶ τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ τὴν ὑψηλὴν τίς ἀποστρέψει; Τοῦ ἔτους, οὗ 28
ἀπέθανεν ὁ Ἄχαζ ὁ βασιλεὺς, ἐγενήθη τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο. Μὴ εὐ- 29
φρανθεῖτε πάντες οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι, συνετρίβη γὰρ ὁ ζυγὸς τοῦ παί-
οντος ὑμᾶς· ἐκ γὰρ σπέρματος ὄφεως ἐξελεύσεται ἔγγονα ἀσπίδων,
καὶ τὰ ἔκγονα αὐτῶν ἐξελεύσονται ὄφεις πετόμενοι, καὶ βοσκη- 30
θήσονται πτωχοὶ δι᾿ αὐτοῦ· πτωχοὶ δὲ ἄνδρες ἐπ᾿ εἰρήνης ἀναπαύ-
σονται· ἀνελεῖ δὲ ἐν λιμῷ τὸ σπέρμα σου, καὶ τὸ κατάλειμμά σου
ἀνελεῖ. Ὀλολύζετε πύλαι πόλεων, κεκραγέτωσαν πόλεις τεταραγ- 31
μέναι, οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι πάντες, ὅτι καπνὸς ἀπὸ βορρᾶ ἔρχεται, καὶ οὐκ
ἔστι τοῦ μεῖναι ἐν τοῖς συντεταγμένοις αὐτοῦ. Καὶ τί ἀποκρι- 32
θήσονται βασιλεῖς ἐθνῶν; ὅτι Κύριος ἐθεμελίωσε Σιὼν, καὶ δι᾿
αὐτοῦ σωθήσονται οἱ ταπεινοὶ τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ.

### Chapter 14

...did not release to their homes those whom he led away captive.
**18** For all the kings of the nations lie in honor, each one in his own house;
**19** But thou shalt be cast forth upon the mountains, as a corpse abhorred, among many who are slain, pierced through with swords, [and] consumed unto Hades. In like manner as a garment stained with blood shall not be clean,
**20** so neither shalt thou be clean. For thou hast destroyed My land, and slain My people; thou shalt not remain for all time, O wicked seed.
**21** Prepare ye a slaughter for thy children, on account of the sins of their father; lest they rise up, and inherit the earth, and fill the earth with wars.
**22** And I will rise up against them, saith the Lord Sabaoth, and I will destroy their name, and their remnant, and their seed. Thus saith the Lord.
**23** And I will make Babylonia desolate, so that hedgehogs may dwell therein; and it shall be for nought. And I will make it a pit of mud unto destruction.
**24** Thus saith the Lord Sabaoth: In the manner I have spoken, so shall it be; and in the manner I have purposed, so shall it abide,
**25** [that I might] destroy the Assyrians in My land, and upon My mountains; and they shall be for a trampling. And their yoke shall be taken away from them, and their pride from their shoulders shall be removed.
**26** This is the counsel which the Lord hath purposed concerning the whole inhabited earth, and this is the hand that is lifted high upon all the nations of the inhabited earth.
**27** For what the Holy God hath purposed, who shall frustrate? And His hand that is lifted high, who shall turn back?
**28** In the year that King Ahaz died, this word came to pass.
**29** Rejoice ye not, all ye foreigners, for the yoke of him that smote you is broken. For out of the seed of a serpent shall come forth progeny of asps, and their offspring shall come forth as flying serpents.
**30** And the poor shall be fed thereby; yea, poor men shall rest in peace. But He shall destroy thy seed by famine, and thy remnant shall He destroy.
**31** Wail, O gates of cities! Let the troubled cities cry out, all ye foreigners! For smoke cometh from the north, and there is none to remain in his ranks.
**32** And what shall the kings of the nations answer? That the Lord hath founded Zion, and through her shall the humble of His people be saved.
