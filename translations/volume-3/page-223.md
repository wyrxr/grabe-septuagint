**21** πάντες οἱ ἀνομοῦντες ἐπὶ κακίᾳ, καὶ οἱ ποιοῦντες ἁμαρτεῖν ἀνθρώπους ἐν λόγῳ, πάντας δὲ τοὺς ἐλέγχοντας ἐν πύλαις πρόσκομμα θήσουσι, καὶ ἐπλαγίασαν ἐν ἀδίκοις δικαίῳ.
**22** Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Κύριος ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον Ἰακώβ, ὃν ἀφώρισεν ἐξ Ἀβραάμ· οὐ νῦν αἰσχυνθήσεται Ἰακώβ, οὐδὲ νῦν τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ μεταβαλεῖ Ἰσραήλ·
**23** ἀλλ᾿ ὅταν ἴδωσι τὰ τέκνα αὐτῶν τὰ ἔργα μου, δι᾿ ἐμὲ ἁγιάσουσι τὸ ὄνομά μου, καὶ ἁγιάσουσι τὸν ἅγιον Ἰακώβ, καὶ τὸν Θεὸν τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ φοβηθήσονται.
**24** Καὶ γνώσονται οἱ τῷ πνεύματι πλανώμενοι σύνεσιν, οἱ δὲ γογγύζοντες μαθήσονται ὑπακούειν, καὶ αἱ γλῶσσαι αἱ ψελλίζουσαι μαθήσονται λαλεῖν εἰρήνην.

ΚΕΦ. Λʹ. ΧΧΧ.

**1** ΟΥΑΙ τέκνα ἀποστάται, (τάδε) λέγει Κύριος· ἐποιήσατε βουλὴν, καὶ οὐ δι᾿ ἐμοῦ, καὶ συνθήκας οὐ διὰ τοῦ πνεύματός μου, προσθεῖναι ἁμαρτίας ἐφ᾿ ἁμαρτίαις·
**2** οἱ πορευόμενοι καταβῆναι εἰς Αἴγυπτον, ἐμὲ δὲ οὐκ ἐπηρώτησαν, τοῦ βοηθηθῆναι ὑπὸ Φαραώ, καὶ σκεπασθῆναι ὑπὸ Αἰγυπτίων.
**3** Ἔσται γὰρ ὑμῖν σκέπη Φαραὼ εἰς αἰσχύνην, καὶ τοῖς πεποιθόσιν ἐπ᾿ Αἴγυπτον ὄνειδος·
**4** ὅτι εἰσὶν ἐν Τάνει ἀρχηγοὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἄγγελοι αὐτοῦ πονηροί.
**5** Μάτην κοπιάσουσι πρὸς λαὸν, ὃς οὐκ ὠφελήσει αὐτοὺς οὔτε εἰς βοήθειαν, οὔτε εἰς ὠφέλειαν, ἀλλὰ εἰς αἰσχύνην καὶ ὄνειδος.
**6** Η ΟΡΑΣΙΣ ΤΩΝ ΤΕΤΡΑΠΟΔΩΝ ΤΩΝ ΕΝ ΤΗ ΕΡΗΜΩ. (Ἐν τῇ θλίψει καὶ ἐν τῇ στενοχωρίᾳ, λέων καὶ σκύμνος λέοντος, ἐκεῖθεν καὶ ἀσπίδες, καὶ ἔχγονα ἀσπίδων πετομένων, οἳ ἔφερον θησαυροὺς αὐτῶν ἐπ᾿ ὤμων ὄνων, καὶ ἐπὶ καμήλων τὸν πλοῦτον αὐτῶν πρὸς ἔθνος, ὃ οὐκ ὠφελήσει αὐτοὺς (εἰς βοήθειαν, ἀλλὰ εἰς αἰσχύνην καὶ ὄνειδος.)
**7** Αἰγύπτιοι μάταια καὶ κενὰ ὠφελήσουσιν ὑμᾶς· ἀπάγγειλον αὐτοῖς, ὅτι ματαία ἡ παράκλησις ὑμῶν αὕτη.
**8** Νῦν οὖν καθίσας γράψον ἐπὶ πυξίου ταῦτα, καὶ εἰς βιβλίον ἐγγράραξον αὐτά· ὅτι ἔσται εἰς ἡμέρας καιρῶν ταῦτα, καὶ ἕως εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα.
**9** Ὅτι λαὸς ἀπειθὴς ἐστιν, υἱοὶ ψευδεῖς, οἳ οὐκ ἠβούλοντο ἀκούειν τὸν νόμον τοῦ Θεοῦ·
**10** οἱ λέγοντες τοῖς προφήταις, μὴ ἀναγγέλλετε ἡμῖν, καὶ τοῖς τὰ ὁράματα ὁρῶσι, μὴ λαλεῖτε ἡμῖν ὀρθῶς, ἀλλὰ ἡμῖν λαλεῖτε δόλια, καὶ ἀναγγέλλετε ἡμῖν ἑτέραν πλάνησιν,
**11** καὶ ἀποστρέψατε ἡμᾶς ἀπὸ τῆς ὁδοῦ ταύτης· ἀφέλετε ἀφ᾿ ἡμῶν τὴν τρίβον τοῦτον, καὶ ἀφέλετε ἀφ᾿ ἡμῶν τὸν ἅγιον τοῦ Ἰσραήλ.

**Chapter 29**
**21** all they that work lawlessness for wickedness; and they that make men to sin with a word; and they shall lay a stumbling-block for all them that reprove in the gates; and they have caused the righteous to stray among the unjust.

**22** Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the house of Jacob, whom He hath set apart from Abraham: 'Now shall Jacob not be ashamed, neither shall the face of Israel now be changed.
**23** But when their children shall see My works, then for My sake shall they hallow My Name; and they shall hallow the Holy One of Jacob, and they shall fear the God of Israel.
**24** And they that err in spirit shall know understanding, and they that murmur shall learn obedience, and the stammering tongues shall learn to speak peace.'

**Chapter 30**

**1** Woe to the apostate children! Thus saith the Lord: 'Ye have made a counsel, but not by Me; and [ye have made] covenants, but not by My Spirit, to add sins upon sins.
**2** They that go forth to descend into Egypt, but have not inquired of Me, that they might be helped by Pharaoh, and be sheltered by the Egyptians.
**3** For the shelter of Pharaoh shall be unto you a shame, and to them that trust in Egypt, a reproach.
**4** For his leaders are in Tanis, and his messengers are evil.
**5** In vain shall they toil for a people that shall not profit them, neither for help, nor for advantage, but for shame and reproach.'

**6** THE VISION OF THE QUADRUPEDS IN THE WILDERNESS.
(In tribulation and in distress, from thence came lion and lion's cub, and vipers, and offspring of flying vipers, who carried their treasures upon the shoulders of donkeys, and their wealth upon camels, unto a nation that shall not profit them [for help, but for shame and reproach].)

**7** The Egyptians shall profit you with vain and empty things. Declare unto them that this your plea is vain.
**8** Now therefore, sit thou down, and write these things upon a tablet, and engrave them deeply in a book; for these things shall be for the days of [future] times, and even unto the age [to come].
**9** For it is a disobedient people, false sons, who would not hearken unto the law of God;
**10** who say unto the prophets, 'Preach not unto us,' and to them that see visions, 'Speak not unto us that which is right; but speak unto us deceitful things, and declare unto us another error,
**11** and turn us away from this path; remove from us this way, and take away from us the Holy One of Israel.'
