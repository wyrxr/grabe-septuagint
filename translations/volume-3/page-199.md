**1** Οὐαὶ τοῖς γράφουσι πονηρίαν· γράφοντες γάρ, πονηρίαν γράφουσιν· ἐκκλίνοντες κρῖσιν πτωχῶν, καὶ ἀρπάζοντες κρῖμα πενήτων τοῦ λαοῦ μου, ὥστε εἶναι αὐτοῖς χήραν εἰς ἁρπαγήν, καὶ ὀρφανὸν εἰς προνομήν.
**2** Καὶ τί ποιήσουσιν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐπισκοπῆς; ἢ γὰρ θλίψις ὑμῖν πόρρωθεν ἥξει, καὶ πρὸς τίνα καταφεύξεσθε τοῦ βοηθηθῆναι; καὶ ποῦ καταλείψετε τὴν δόξαν ὑμῶν, τοῦ μὴ ἐμπεσεῖν εἰς ἐπαγωγήν;
**3** Καὶ ὑποκάτω ἀνηρημένων πεσοῦνται. Ἐπὶ τούτοις πᾶσιν οὐκ ἀπεστράφη θυμός, ἀλλ᾿ ἔτι ἡ χεὶρ ὑψηλή.
**4** Οὐαὶ Ἀσσυρίοις, ἡ ῥάβδος τοῦ θυμοῦ μου, καὶ ὀργὴ ἐστιν ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτῶν· ἐν τῷ ἐγὼ μοῦ εἰς ἔθνος ἄνομον ἀποστελῶ, καὶ τῷ ἐμῷ λαῷ συντάξω τοῦ ποιῆσαι σκῦλα καὶ προνομήν, καὶ καταπατεῖν τὰς πόλεις αὐτοῦ, καὶ θεῖναι αὐτὰς εἰς κονιορτόν.
**5** Αὐτὸς δὲ οὐχ οὕτως ἐνεθυμήθη, καὶ τῇ ψυχῇ οὐχ οὕτως λελόγισται· ἀλλὰ ἀπαλλάξει ὁ νοῦς αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοῦ ἐξολεθρεῦσαι ἔθνη οὐκ ὀλίγα.
**6** Καὶ ἐὰν εἴπωσιν αὐτῷ, οὐ σὺ μόνος εἶ ἄρχων;
**7** Καὶ ἐρεῖ· οὐκ ἔλαβον τὴν χώραν τὴν ἐπάνω Βαβυλῶνος καὶ Χαλάνης, οὐ ὁ πύργος ᾠκοδομήθη, καὶ ἔλαβον Ἀραβίαν καὶ Δαμασκὸν καὶ Σαμάρειαν;
**8** ὃν τρόπον ταύτας ἔλαβον ἐν τῇ χειρί μου, καὶ πάσας τὰς ἀρχὰς λήψομαι.
**9** Ὀλολύξατε τὰ γλυπτὰ ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ· ὃν τρόπον γὰρ ἐποίησα Σαμαρείᾳ καὶ τοῖς χειροποιήτοις αὐτῆς, οὕτως ποιήσω καὶ Ἱερουσαλὴμ καὶ τοῖς εἰδώλοις αὐτῆς.
**10** Καὶ ἔσται, ὅταν συντελέσῃ Κύριος πάντα ποιῶν ἐν τῷ ὄρει Σιὼν καὶ ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, ἐπισκέψομαι ἐπὶ τὸν νοῦν τὸν μέγαν, ἐπὶ τὸν ἄρχοντα τῶν Ἀσσυρίων, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸ ὕψος τῆς δόξης τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν αὐτοῦ.
**11** Εἶπε γὰρ· ἐν τῇ ἰσχύϊ τῆς χειρός μου ποιήσω, καὶ ἐν τῇ σοφίᾳ τῆς συνέσεως ἀφελῶ ὅρια ἐθνῶν, καὶ τὴν ἰσχὺν αὐτῶν προνομεύσω· καὶ σείσω πόλεις κατοικουμένας,
**12** καὶ τὴν οἰκουμένην ὅλην καταλήψομαι τῇ χειρί μου ὡς νοσσιάν, καὶ ὡς καταλελειμμένα ὠὰ ἀρῶ· καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ὃς διαφεύξεται με, ἢ ἀνοίγων τὸ στόμα ἀντείπῃ μοι.
**13** Μὴ δοξασθήσεται ἀξίνη ἄνευ τοῦ κόπτοντος ἐν αὐτῇ; ἢ ὑψωθήσεται πρὶν ἄνευ τοῦ ἕλκοντος αὐτόν; ὡς ἐάν τις ἄρῃ ῥάβδον ἢ ξύλον.
**14** Καὶ οὐχ οὕτως, ἀλλὰ ἀποστελεῖ Κύριος Σαβαὼθ εἰς τὴν σὴν τιμὴν ἀτιμίαν, καὶ εἰς τὴν σὴν δόξαν πῦρ καιόμενον καυθήσεται· καὶ ἔσται τὸ φῶς τοῦ

**1** Woe unto them that write wickedness! For writing, they do but write wickedness; [even they] that turn aside the judgment of the poor, and seize the right of the needy of My people; so that the widow may be unto them a prey, and the orphan for a spoil.
**2** And what shall they do in the day of visitation? For either shall tribulation come upon you from afar, and unto whom shall ye flee to be helped? And where shall ye leave your glory, that ye fall not into affliction?
**3** And they shall fall beneath the slain. For all these things, His wrath hath not turned away, but His hand is yet lifted high.
**4** Woe to the Assyrians, the rod of My wrath; and My indignation is in their hands. When I Myself shall send [him] unto a lawless nation, and shall command My people to make spoil and plunder, and to tread down its cities, and to lay them waste as dust.
**5** But he himself hath not so thought, nor hath it been so reckoned in his soul; rather, his mind shall be given over [to destroy], and to utterly destroy nations, not a few.
**6** And if they shall say unto him, "Art thou not the sole ruler?"
**7** Then he shall say, "Did I not take the land above Babylon and Calneh? Was not the tower built? And did I not take Arabia and Damascus and Samaria?"
**8** "Even as I took these in mine hand, so shall I take all dominions."
**9** Howl, ye graven images in Jerusalem and in Samaria! For even as I did unto Samaria and unto her handcrafted [idols], so shall I do also unto Jerusalem and unto her idols.
**10** And it shall be, when the Lord hath performed all His work upon Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, I will visit upon the great mind, upon the ruler of the Assyrians, and upon the haughtiness of the glory of his eyes.
**11** For he hath said: "By the might of my hand shall I do [this], and by the wisdom of my understanding shall I remove the boundaries of nations, and their strength shall I plunder. And I shall shake inhabited cities,
**12** and the whole inhabited earth shall I seize with my hand as a nest, and as abandoned eggs shall I take them away; and there is none that shall escape me, or that, opening his mouth, shall speak against me."
**13** Shall an axe glorify itself without him that cutteth therewith? Or shall it be exalted before, without him that draweth it? As if one should lift up a rod, or wood.
**14** But not so [shall it be]; nay, the Lord of Hosts shall send forth shame upon thy honor, and upon thy glory shall a burning fire be kindled; and the light of
