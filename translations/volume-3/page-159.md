ΚΕΦ. ΚΕ΄. Κς΄.                          ΠΑΡΟΙΜΙΑΙ.        1097
πηγὴν φράσσοι καὶ ὕδατος ἔξοδον λυμαίνοιτο, οὕτως ἄκοσμον δίκαιον πεπτωκέναι ἐνώπιον ἀσεβοῦς. ᾿Εσθίειν μέλι πολὺ οὐ καλόν· 27
τιμᾷν δὲ χρὴ λόγους ἐνδόξους. ῞Ωσπερ πόλις τὰ τείχη καταβεβλημένη καὶ ἀτείχιστος, οὕτως ἀνὴρ ὃς οὐ μετὰ βουλῆς τι πράσσει. 28

ΚΕΦ. Κς΄. XXVI.

῞Ωσπερ δρόσος ἐν ἀμητῷ, καὶ ὥσπερ ὑετὸς ἐν θέρει, οὕτως 1
οὐκ ἔστιν ἄφρονι τιμή. ῞Ωσπερ ὄρνεα πέτανται καὶ στρουθοί, οὕτως 2
ἀρὰ ματαία οὐκ ἐπελεύσεται οὐδενί. ῞Ωσπερ μάστιξ ἵππῳ, 3
καὶ κέντρον ὄνῳ, οὕτως ῥάβδος ἕλκει παρανόμους. Μὴ ἀποκρίνου 4
ἄφρονι κατὰ τὴν ἐκείνου ἀφροσύνην, ἵνα μὴ ὅμοιος γένῃ αὐτῷ·
ἀλλὰ ἀποκρίνου ἄφρονι πρὸς τὴν ἀφροσύνην αὐτοῦ, ἵνα μὴ φαίνηται 5
σοφὸς παρ᾿ ἑαυτῷ. ᾿Εκ τῶν ἑαυτοῦ ὁδῶν ὄνειδος πίεται ὁ ἀποστείλας 6
δι᾿ ἀγγέλου ἄφρονος λόγον. ᾿Αφελοῦ πορείαν σκελῶν χωλῶν, 7
καὶ παροιμίαν ἐκ στόματος ἀφρόνων. ῞Ος ἀποδεσμεύει λίθον 8
ἐν σφενδόνῃ, ὅμοιός ἐστι τῷ διδόντι ἄφρονι δόξαν. ῎Ακανθαι φύονται 9
ἐν χειρὶ τοῦ μεθύσου, δουλεία δὲ ἐν χειρὶ τῶν ἀφρόνων. Πολλὰ 10
χειμάζεται πᾶσα σὰρξ ἀφρόνων· συντρίβεται γὰρ ἡ ἔκστασις
αὐτῶν. ῞Ωσπερ κύων ὅταν ἐπέλθῃ ἐπὶ τὸν ἔμετον αὐτοῦ καὶ μισητὸς 11
γένηται, οὕτως ἄφρων ἐν τῇ ἑαυτοῦ κακίᾳ ἀναστρέψας ἐπὶ
τὴν ἑαυτοῦ ἁμαρτίαν. ῎Εστιν αἰσχύνη ἐπάγουσα ἁμαρτίαν, καὶ
ἔστιν αἰσχύνη δόξα καὶ χάρις. ῎Ιδον ἄνδρα δόξαντα παρ᾿ ἑαυτῷ 12
σοφὸν εἶναι, ἐλπίδα μέντοι ἔσχεν ἄφρων μᾶλλον αὐτοῦ. Λέγει 13
ὀκνηρὸς ἀποστελλόμενος εἰς ὁδόν· λέων ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς ἐν δὲ ταῖς
πλατείαις φονευταί. ῞Ωσπερ θύρα στρέφεται ἐπὶ τῷ στρόφιγγι, 14
οὕτως ὀκνηρὸς ἐπὶ τῆς κλίνης αὐτοῦ. Κρύψας ὀκνηρὸς τὴν χεῖρα 15
αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ κόλπῳ αὐτοῦ, οὐ δύναται ἐπενεγκεῖν εἰς τὸ στόμα.
Σοφώτερος ὀκνηρὸς ἑαυτῷ φαίνεται τοῦ ἐν πλησμονῇ ἀποκομίζοντος 16
ἀγγελίαν. ῞Ωσπερ ὁ κρατῶν κέρκου κυνὸς, οὕτως ὁ προεστὼς 17
ἀλλοτρίας κρίσεως. ῞Ωσπερ οἱ πειρώμενοι προβάλλουσι λόγους εἰς 18
ἀνθρώπους, ὁ δὲ ἀπαντήσας τῷ λόγῳ πρῶτος ὑποσκελισθήσεται·
οὕτω πάντες οἱ ἐνεδρεύοντες τοὺς ἑαυτῶν φίλους, ὅταν δ᾿ ἐφορα- 19
θῶσι, λέγουσιν, ὅτι παίζων ἔπραξα. ᾿Εν πολλοῖς ξύλοις θάλλει 20
πῦρ· ὅπου δὲ οὐκ ἔστιν ἐξέθυμος, ἡσυχάζει μάχη. ᾿Εσχάρα ἀν- 21
θρακὶ, καὶ ξύλα πυρί· ἀνὴρ δὲ λοίδορος εἰς ταραχὴν μάχης. Λό- 22

**Proverbs Chapter 25**

**27** To eat much honey is not good; but it is meet to honor glorious words.
**28** As a city whose walls are thrown down and unwalled, so is a man who doth anything without counsel.

**Proverbs Chapter 26**

**1** As dew in the harvest, and as rain in the summer, so is honor not fitting for a fool.
**2** As birds do flutter and sparrows do fly, so a vain curse shall not alight upon any man.
**3** As the whip for the horse, and the goad for the ass, so is the rod to draw out the lawless.
**4** Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him;
**5** But answer a fool according to his folly, lest he seem wise in his own conceit.
**6** He that sendeth a message by the hand of a foolish messenger, from his own ways shall drink reproach.
**7** Remove the progress of lame legs, and a proverb from the mouth of fools.
**8** As one who bindeth a stone in a sling, so is he who giveth glory to a fool.
**9** Thorns do grow in the hand of the drunkard, and slavery in the hand of fools.
**10** All the flesh of fools is greatly troubled; for their madness is broken.
**11** As a dog when it cometh again unto his vomit, and is made hateful, so is a fool in his wickedness, turning again to his own sin.
**12** There is a shame that bringeth forth sin, and there is a shame that is glory and grace. I have seen a man who seemed wise in his own eyes; yet a fool had more hope than he.
**13** The sluggard, when he is sent on a journey, saith: "There is a lion in the roads, and murderers in the broadways."
**14** As the door doth turn upon its hinge, so doth the sluggard upon his bed.
**15** The sluggard, having hidden his hand in his bosom, is not able to bring it unto his mouth.
**16** The sluggard seemeth wiser unto himself than he who bringeth a message in fullness.
**17** As he that taketh a dog by the tail, so is he that meddleth in another's strife.
**18** As those who [seek to] deceive do cast forth words unto men, and he that first meeteth the word shall be tripped up;
**19** So are all they who lie in wait for their friends, but when they are observed, they say, "I did it but in play."
**20** With much wood doth the fire blaze; but where there is no hot-tempered man, the quarrel ceaseth.
**21** As coals for the burning hearth, and wood for the fire; so is a contentious man to stir up the turmoil of strife.
**22** The words of whisperers are soft; yet do they strike into the innermost chambers of the heart.
