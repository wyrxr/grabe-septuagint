11 τῷ πρωτοτόκῳ. Ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ μεγαλυνθήσεται ὁ κοπετὸς
12 ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ, ὡς κοπετὸς ῥοῶνος ἐν πεδίῳ ἐκκοπτομένου· καὶ
    κόψεται ἡ γῆ κατὰ φυλὰς φυλάς· φυλὴ καθ᾽ ἑαυτὴν, καὶ αἱ γυ-
    ναῖκες αὐτῶν καθ᾽ ἑαυτάς· φυλὴ οἴκου Δαυΐδ καθ᾽ ἑαυτὴν, καὶ αἱ
    γυναῖκες αὐτῶν καθ᾽ ἑαυτάς· φυλὴ οἴκου Νάθαν καθ᾽ ἑαυτὴν, καὶ
13 αἱ γυναῖκες αὐτῶν καθ᾽ ἑαυτάς· φυλὴ οἴκου Λευεὶ καθ᾽ ἑαυτὴν,
    καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες αὐτῶν καθ᾽ ἑαυτάς· φυλὴ τοῦ Συμεὼν καθ᾽ ἑαυ-
14 τὴν, καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες αὐτῶν καθ᾽ ἑαυτάς· πᾶσαι αἱ φυλαὶ αἱ ὑπο-
    λελειμμέναι, φυλὴ καθ᾽ ἑαυτὴν, καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες αὐτῶν καθ᾽ ἑαυτάς.

1  Ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἔσται πᾶς τόπος διανοιγόμενος ἐν τῷ
    οἴκῳ Δαυΐδ, καὶ τοῖς κατοικοῦσιν Ἱερουσαλὴμ εἰς τὴν μετακίνη-
2 σιν, καὶ εἰς τὸν χωρισμόν. Καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, λέγει
    Κύριος Σαβαὼθ, ἐξολεθρεύσω τὰ ὀνόματα τῶν εἰδώλων ἀπὸ τῆς
    γῆς, καὶ οὐκέτι ἔσται αὐτῶν μνεία· καὶ τοὺς ψευδοπροφήτας, καὶ
3 τὸ πνεῦμα τὸ ἀκάθαρτον ἐξαρῶ ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς. Καὶ ἔσται ἐὰν
    προφητεύσῃ ἄνθρωπος ἔτι, καὶ ἐρεῖ πρὸς αὐτὸν ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ
    καὶ ἡ μήτηρ αὐτοῦ, οἱ γεννήσαντες αὐτὸν, ἐν τῷ προφητεύειν αὐ-
    τόν· οὐ ζήσῃ, ὅτι ψευδῆ ἐλάλησας ἐν ὀνόματι Κυρίου· καὶ συμ-
    ποδιοῦσιν αὐτὸν ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἡ μήτηρ αὐτοῦ, οἱ γεννή-
4 σαντες αὐτὸν, ἐν τῷ προφητεύειν αὐτόν. Καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ
    ἐκείνῃ καταισχυνθήσονται οἱ προφῆται, ἕκαστος ἐκ τῆς ὁράσεως
    αὐτοῦ, ἐν τῷ προφητεύειν αὐτὸν, καὶ ἐνδύσονται δέρριν τριχίνην,
5 ἀνθ᾽ ὧν ἐψεύσαντο. Καὶ ἐρεῖ· οὐκ εἰμὶ προφήτης ἐγώ, διότι ἄν-
    θρωπος ἐργαζόμενος τὴν γῆν ἐγώ εἰμι, ὅτι ἄνθρωπος ἐγέννησέ με
6 ἐκ νεότητός μου. Καὶ ἐρῶ πρὸς αὐτόν· τί αἱ πληγαὶ αὗται ἀνα-
    μέσον τῶν χειρῶν σου; καὶ ἐρεῖ, ἃς ἐπλήγην ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ ἀ-
7 γαπητοῦ μου. Ῥομφαία ἐξεγέρθητι ἐπὶ τὸν ποιμένα μου, καὶ ἐπ᾽
    ἄνδρα πολίτην μου, λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ· πάταξον τὸν ποι-
    μένα, καὶ διασκορπισθήσονται τὰ πρόβατα τῆς ποίμνης· καὶ ἐπά-
8 ξω τὴν χεῖρά μου ἐπὶ τοὺς μικρούς. Καὶ ἔσται ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ,
    λέγει Κύριος, τὰ δύο μέρη αὐτῆς ἐξολεθρευθήσεται καὶ ἐκλείψει,
9 τὸ δὲ τρίτον ὑπολειφθήσεται ἐν αὐτῇ· καὶ διάξω τὸ τρίτον διὰ
    πυρὸς, καὶ πυρώσω αὐτοὺς, ὡς πυροῦται τὸ ἀργύριον, καὶ δοκιμάσω

**Zechariah [Chapter] 12**

**11** ...an anguish, [even] a grief, as one [grieves] for the firstborn. In that day shall the lamentation be great
**12** in Jerusalem, as the lamentation of a pomegranate orchard being cut down in a plain. And the land shall mourn, tribe by tribe; each tribe by itself, and their women by themselves; the tribe of the house of David by itself, and their women by themselves; the tribe of the house of Nathan by itself, and
**13** their women by themselves; the tribe of the house of Levi by itself, and their women by themselves; the tribe of Simeon by itself,
**14** and their women by themselves; all the remaining tribes, each tribe by itself, and their women by themselves.

**Zechariah [Chapter] 13**

**1** In that day shall every place be opened in the house of David, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for purification and for separation.
**2** And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord of hosts, I will utterly destroy the names of the idols from the land, and they shall no more be remembered; and the false prophets, and the unclean spirit, will I remove from the land.
**3** And it shall come to pass, if a man shall prophesy yet again, then his father and his mother, who begat him, shall say unto him when he prophesieth, "Thou shalt not live, for thou hast spoken falsely in the Name of the Lord." And his father and his mother, who begat him, shall fetter him when he prophesieth.
**4** And it shall come to pass in that day, the prophets shall be ashamed, every one for his vision, when he prophesieth; and they shall put on a hairy garment, for that which they have lied.
**5** And he shall say, "I am not a prophet; for I am a man who tilleth the ground, for a man begat me from my youth."
**6** And I shall say unto him, "What are these wounds betwixt thine hands?" And he shall say, "[Those] wherewith I was wounded in the house of My Beloved."
**7** Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, and against the Man [who is] My fellow citizen, saith the Lord Almighty! Smite the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered. And I will turn My hand upon the little ones.
**8** And it shall come to pass in all the land, saith the Lord, two parts thereof shall be utterly destroyed and perish, but the third part shall be left therein.
**9** And I will bring the third part through fire, and I will refine them, as silver is refined; and I will test them,
