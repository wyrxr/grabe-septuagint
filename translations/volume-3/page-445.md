καταβαινόντων εἰς λάκκον, καὶ παρεκάλουν αὐτὸν ἐν γῇ κάτω
πάντα τὰ ξύλα τῆς τρυφῆς, καὶ τὰ ἐκλεκτὰ τοῦ Λιβάνου πάντα
τὰ πίνοντα ὕδωρ. Καὶ γὰρ αὐτοὶ κατέβησαν μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ εἰς ᾅδου 17
ἐν τραυματίαις μαχαίρας, καὶ τὸ σπέρμα αὐτοῦ πάντες οἱ κα-
τοικοῦντες ὑπὸ τὴν σκέπην αὐτοῦ ἐν μέσω τῆς ζωῆς αὐτῶν ἀ-
πώλοντο. Τίνι ὡμοιώθης; κατάβηθι, καὶ καταβιβασθήτι μετὰ 18
τῶν ξύλων τῆς τρυφῆς εἰς γῆν βάθους· ἐν μέσω ἀπεριτμήτων κοι-
μηθήτῃ μετὰ τραυματιῶν μαχαίρας, οὕτως Φαραὼ καὶ πᾶν τὸ
πλῆθος τῆς ἰσχύος αὐτοῦ, λέγει Κύριος Κύριος.

ΚΕΦ. ΛΒ´. XXXII.

ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ δωδεκάτῳ ἔτει, ἐν τῷ δωδεκάτῳ μηνί, 1
μιᾷ τοῦ μηνός, ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς μέ, λέγων· υἱὲ ἀνθρώ- 2
που, λάβε θρῆνον ἐπὶ Φαραὼ βασιλέα Αἰγύπτου, καὶ ἐρεῖς αὐτῷ·
λέοντι ἐθνῶν ὡμοιώθης σύ, καὶ ὡς ὁ δράκων ὁ ἐν τῇ θαλάσσῃ, καὶ
ἐκεράτιζες τοῖς ποταμοῖς σου, καὶ ἐτάρασσες τὸ ὕδωρ τοῖς ποσί
σου, καὶ κατεπάτεις τοὺς ποταμούς σου. Τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναῖ Κύ- 3
ριος· καὶ περιβαλῶ ἐπὶ σὲ δίκτυόν μου (καὶ) ἐν ἐκκλησίᾳ λαῶν πολ-
λῶν, καὶ ἀνάξω σε ἐν τῷ ἀγκίστρῳ μου, καὶ ἐκτενῶ σε ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν· 4
πεδία πλησθήσεταί σου, καὶ ἐπικαθιῶ ἐπί σε πάντα τὰ πετεινὰ τοῦ
οὐρανοῦ, καὶ ἐμπλήσω ἐκ σοῦ πάντα τὰ θηρία πάσης τῆς γῆς.
Καὶ δώσω τὰς σάρκας σου ἐπὶ τὰ ὄρη, καὶ ἐμπλήσω ἀπὸ τοῦ αἵ- 5
ματος σου πᾶσαν γῆν, καὶ ποτισθήσεται ἡ γῆ ἀπὸ τῶν χωρημά- 6
των σου, καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ πλήθους σου ἐπὶ τῶν ὀρέων· φάραγγας ἐμ-
πλήσω ἀπὸ σοῦ, καὶ κατακαλύψω ἐν τῷ σβεσθῆναί σε οὐρανὸν, καὶ 7
συσκοτάσω τοὺς ἀστέρας αὐτοῦ, ἥλιον ἐν νεφέλῃ καλύψω, καὶ ἡ
σελήνη οὐ μὴ φάνῃ τὸ φῶς αὐτῆς· καὶ πάντα τὰ φάινοντα φῶς 8
ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ συσκοτάσουσιν ἐπὶ σέ· καὶ δώσω σκότος ἐπὶ τὴν
γῆν σου, λέγει Κύριος Κύριος ὁ Θεός. Καὶ παροργιῶ καρδίαν 9
λαῶν πολλῶν, ἡνίκα ἂν ἀγάγω αἰχμαλωσίαν σου εἰς τὰ ἔθνη,
εἰς τὴν γῆν ἣν οὐκ ἔγνως. Καὶ συγκνάσωσιν ἐπὶ σὲ ἔθνη πολλά, 10
καὶ οἱ βασιλεῖς αὐτῶν ἐκστάσει ἐκστήσονται ἐπὶ σέ, ἐν τῷ πε-
πεσθῆναι ῥομφαίαν μου ἐπὶ πρόσωπον αὐτῶν, προσδεχόμενοι
τὴν πτῶσιν αὐτῶν, ἀφ᾿ ἡμέρας πτώσεώς σου. ῞Οτι τάδε λέγει 11
Ἀδωναῖ Κύριος· ῥομφαία βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος ἥξει σοι, ἐν μα- 12

**Chapter 31**

**16** ...[those] that go down into the pit; and all the trees of delight, and all the choicest of Lebanon, all that drink water, did comfort it in the land beneath.
**17** For they also went down with it into Hades among those slain by the sword, and all its offspring, all that dwelt under its shade, perished in the midst of their life.
**18** "To whom wert thou likened? Go down, and be brought down with the trees of delight into the land of depth; among the uncircumcised let him lie down with those slain by the sword. So shall Pharaoh and all the multitude of his might [be]," saith the Lord, the Lord.

**Chapter 32**

**1** And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the first [day] of the month, that the word of the Lord came unto me, saying:
**2** "Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and thou shalt say unto him: 'To a lion of the nations wert thou likened, and as the dragon that is in the sea. And thou didst butt with thy horns in thy rivers, and didst trouble the water with thy feet, and didst trample thy rivers.
**3** Thus saith Adonai the Lord: "And I shall cast My net over thee, and [even] in the assembly of many peoples, and I will draw thee up with My hook, and spread thee forth upon the land.
**4** The plains shall be filled with thee, and I shall cause all the fowls of heaven to alight upon thee, and I shall fill all the beasts of all the earth with thee.
**5** And I will give thy flesh upon the mountains, and I will fill all the earth with thy blood.
**6** And the earth shall be watered by thy torrents, and by thy multitude upon the mountains. I shall fill the valleys with thee,
**7** and I will cover the heaven when thou art extinguished, and I will make its stars dark. I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not show her light.
**8** And all the shining lights in the heaven shall I make dark over thee. And I will put darkness upon thy land," saith the Lord, the Lord God.
**9** "And I will vex the heart of many peoples, whensoever I shall bring thy captivity unto the nations, unto the land which thou hast not known.
**10** And many nations shall be broken concerning thee, and their kings shall be utterly amazed at thee, when My sword shall have fallen upon their face, they awaiting their fall from the day of thy fall.
**11** For thus saith Adonai the Lord: 'The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee,
