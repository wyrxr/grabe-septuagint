**ΨΑΛΤΗΡΙΟΝ.**

**ΨΑΛΜ. ΙΔʹ. XIV.**
ΨΑΛΜΟΣ τῷ Δαυΐδ.
1 Κύριε τίς παροικήσει ἐν τῷ σκηνώματί σου; ἢ τίς κατασκηνώσει ἐν ὄρει τῷ ἁγίῳ σου;
2 Πορευόμενος ἄμωμος, καὶ ἐργαζόμενος δικαιοσύνην· λαλῶν ἀλήθειαν ἐν καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ·
3 ὃς οὐκ ἐδόλωσεν ἐν γλώσσῃ αὐτοῦ, οὐδὲ ἐποίησε τῷ πλησίον αὐτοῦ κακόν, καὶ ὀνειδισμὸν οὐκ ἔλαβεν ἐπὶ τοὺς ἔγγιστα αὐτοῦ·
4 ἐξουδένωται ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ (πᾶς) πονηρευόμενος, τοὺς δὲ φοβουμένους Κύριον δοξάζει· ὁ ὀμνύων τῷ πλησίον αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἀθετῶν·
5 τὸ ἀργύριον αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἔδωκεν ἐπὶ τόκῳ, καὶ δῶρα ἐπ᾿ ἀθώῳ οὐκ ἔλαβεν· ὁ ποιῶν ταῦτα, οὐ σαλευθήσεται εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ΙΕʹ. XV.**
ΣΤΗΛΟΓΡΑΦΙΑ τῷ Δαυΐδ.
1 Φύλαξόν με Κύριε, ὅτι ἐπὶ σοὶ ἤλπισα.
2 Εἶπα τῷ Κυρίῳ· κύριός μου εἶ σύ· ὅτι τῶν ἀγαθῶν μου οὐ χρείαν ἔχεις.
3 Τοῖς ἁγίοις τοῖς ἐν τῇ γῇ αὐτοῦ, ἐθαυμάστωσε πάντα τὰ θελήματα αὐτοῦ ἐν αὐτοῖς.
4 Ἐπληθύνθησαν αἱ ἀσθένειαι αὐτῶν, μετὰ ταῦτα ἐτάχυναν· οὐ μὴ συναγάγω τὰς συναγωγὰς αὐτῶν ἐξ αἱμάτων,
5 οὐδ᾿ οὐ μὴ μνησθῶ τῶν ὀνομάτων αὐτῶν διὰ χειλέων μου. Κύριος ἡ μερὶς τῆς κληρονομίας μου καὶ τοῦ ποτηρίου μου· σὺ εἶ ὁ ἀποκαθιστῶν τὴν κληρονομίαν μου ἐμοί.
6 Σχοινία ἐπέπεσάν μοι ἐν τοῖς κρατίστοις· καὶ γὰρ ἡ κληρονομία μου κρατίστη μοι ἐστίν.
7 Εὐλογήσω τὸν Κύριον τὸν συνετίσαντά με· ἔτι δὲ καὶ ἕως νυκτὸς ἐπαίδευσαν με οἱ νεφροί μου.
8 Προωρώμην τὸν Κύριον ἐνώπιόν μου διαπαντὸς· ὅτι ἐκ δεξιῶν μου ἐστίν, ἵνα μὴ σαλευθῶ.
9 Διὰ τοῦτο ηὐφράνθη ἡ καρδία μου, καὶ ἠγαλλιάσατο ἡ γλῶσσά μου· ἔτι δὲ καὶ ἡ σάρξ μου κατασκηνώσει ἐπ᾿ ἐλπίδι.
10 Ὅτι οὐκ ἐγκαταλείψεις τὴν ψυχήν μου εἰς ᾅδου, οὐδὲ δώσεις τὸν ὅσιόν σου ἰδεῖν διαφθοράν.
11 Ἐγνώρισάς μοι ὁδοὺς ζωῆς· πληρώσεις με εὐφροσύνης μετὰ τοῦ προσώπου σου· τερπνότητες ἐν τῇ δεξιᾷ σου εἰς τέλος.

## THE PSALTER

### PSALM XIV
A Psalm of David.
1 Lord, who shall sojourn in Thy tabernacle? Or who shall dwell upon Thy holy mountain?
2 He that walketh blameless, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh truth in his heart.
3 Who hath not used deceit in his tongue, nor wrought evil to his neighbour, nor taken up a reproach against those nearest him;
4 In whose sight every one that dealeth wickedly is set at nought; but he honoureth them that fear the Lord. He that sweareth to his neighbour and changeth not [his oath];
5 Who hath not lent his money upon usury, nor received gifts against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.

### PSALM XV
An Inscription of David.
1 Preserve me, O Lord, for in Thee have I put my trust.
2 I have said unto the Lord, "Thou art my Lord; for of my good things Thou hast no need."
3 Unto the saints that are in His land, He hath made marvellous all His desires in them.
4 Their weaknesses were multiplied; after these things they hastened. I will not assemble their gatherings of blood,
5 Nor will I make mention of their names through my lips. The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup; Thou art He that restoreth my inheritance unto me.
6 The lines have fallen unto me in goodly places; yea, mine inheritance is excellent unto me.
7 I will bless the Lord, Who hath given me understanding; moreover, even in the night my reins have chastened me.
8 I set the Lord always before my face; for He is at my right hand, that I should not be moved.
9 Therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; moreover, my flesh also shall rest in hope.
10 For Thou wilt not leave my soul in Hades, neither wilt Thou suffer Thine Holy One to see corruption.
11 Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; Thou shalt fill me with gladness with Thy countenance; and at Thy right hand there are delights for evermore.
