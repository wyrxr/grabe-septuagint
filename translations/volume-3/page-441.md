Αἰγύπτου ἀπώλεια καὶ ἔρημος· καὶ γνώσονται ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι Κύριος· ἀντὶ τοῦ λέγειν σε, ὅτι οἱ ποταμοί ἐμοί εἰσι, καὶ ἐγὼ ἐποίησα αὐτούς. Διὰ τοῦτο ἰδοὺ ἐγώ ἐπὶ σὲ, καὶ ἐπὶ πάντας τοὺς ποταμούς σου, καὶ δώσω τὴν γῆν Αἰγύπτου εἰς ἔρημον καὶ ῥομφαίαν καὶ ἀπώλειαν ἀπὸ Μαγδωλοῦ καὶ Σοήνης καὶ ἕως ὁρίων Αἰθιοπίας. Οὐ μὴ διέλθῃ ἐν αὐτῇ πούς ἀνθρώπου, καὶ πούς κτήνους οὐ μὴ διέλθῃ αὐτὴν, οὐδὲ κατοικηθήσεται τεσσαράκοντα ἔτη. Καὶ δώσω τὴν γῆν αὐτῆς εἰς ἀπώλειαν ἐν μέσῳ γῆς ἠρημωμένης, καὶ αἱ πόλεις αὐτῆς ἐν μέσῳ πόλεων ἠρημωμένων ἔσονται· ἀφανισμὸς ἔσται τεσσαράκοντα ἔτη· καὶ διασπερῶ Αἴγυπτον ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι, καὶ λικμήσω αὐτοὺς εἰς τὰς χώρας. Ὅτι τάδε λέγει Κύριος Κύριος· μετὰ τεσσαράκοντα ἔτη συνάξω τοὺς Αἰγυπτίους ἀπὸ τῶν ἐθνῶν, οὗ διεσκορπίσθησαν ἐκεῖ, καὶ ἀποστρέψω τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν Αἰγύπτου, καὶ κατοικιῶ αὐτοὺς ἐν γῇ Παθουρῆς, ἐν τῇ γῇ ὅθεν ἐλήφθησαν, καὶ ἔσται ἀρχὴ ταπεινή· παρὰ πάσας τὰς ἀρχὰς ἔσται ταπεινή, καὶ οὐ μὴ ὑψωθῇ ἔτι ἐπὶ τὰ ἔθνη, καὶ ὀλιγοστοὺς αὐτοὺς ποιήσω, τοῦ μὴ εἶναι αὐτοὺς πλείονας ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι, καὶ οὐκέτι ἔσονται τῷ οἴκῳ Ἰσραὴλ εἰς ἐλπίδα ἀναμιμνήσκουσαν ἀνομίαν, ἐν τῷ αὐτοὺς ἀκολουθῆσαι ὀπίσω τῶν καρδιῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ γνώσονται ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι Κύριος ὁ Θεός. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἑβδόμῳ καὶ εἰκοστῷ ἔτει, μιᾷ τοῦ μηνὸς τοῦ πρώτου, ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρός με, λέγων· υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, Ναβουχοδονόσορ βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος κατεδουλώσατο τὴν δύναμιν αὐτοῦ δουλείᾳ μεγάλῃ ἐπὶ Τύρον, πᾶσα κεφαλὴ φαλακρὰ, καὶ πᾶς ὦμος μαδῶν· καὶ μισθὸς οὐκ ἐγενήθη αὐτῷ καὶ τῇ δυνάμει αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ Τύρον, καὶ τῆς δουλείας ἧς ἐδούλωσεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτήν. Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναὶ Κύριος· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ δίδωμι τῷ Ναβουχοδονόσορ βασιλεῖ Βαβυλῶνος γῆν Αἰγύπτου, καὶ λήψεται τὸ πλῆθος αὐτῆς, καὶ προνομεύσει τὴν προνομὴν αὐτῆς, καὶ σκυλεύσει τὰ σκῦλα αὐτῆς· καὶ ἔσται μισθὸς τῇ δυνάμει αὐτοῦ, ἀντὶ τῆς λειτουργείας αὐτοῦ ἧς ἐδούλευσεν ἐπὶ Τύρον, δέδωκα αὐτῷ γῆν Αἴγυπτον, ὅσα ἐποίησάν μοι· τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναὶ Κύριος· ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἀνατελεῖ κέρας παντὶ τῷ οἴκῳ Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ δώσω σοι στόμα ἀνεῳγμένον ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῶν, καὶ γνώσονται ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι Κύριος.

**Chapter 29**

**9** of Egypt [shall be] a devastation and a wilderness; and they shall know that I am the Lord, because thou didst say, "The rivers are mine own, and I have made them."
**10** Therefore, behold, I am against thee, and against all thy rivers; and I will make the land of Egypt into a wilderness, a sword, and a devastation, from Migdol and Syene even unto the borders of Ethiopia.
**11** No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited for forty years.
**12** And I will make her land a desolation in the midst of desolate lands, and her cities shall be in the midst of desolate cities; there shall be a devastation for forty years; and I will scatter Egypt among the nations, and I will winnow them into the countries.
**13** For thus saith Adonai the Lord: After forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the nations whither they were scattered there;
**14** and I will turn back the captivity of Egypt, and I will cause them to dwell in the land of Pathros, in the land whence they were taken, and it shall be a lowly dominion; it shall be lowly above all dominions;
**15** and it shall no more exalt itself upon the nations; and I will make them few in number, so that they shall not be more among the nations;
**16** and they shall no longer be a hope to the house of Israel, reminding [them of] iniquity, in that they followed after their own hearts; and they shall know that I am the Lord God.
**17** And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, on the first [day] of the first month, the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
**18** Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon hath caused his army to serve with great service against Tyre; every head [was] bald, and every shoulder [was] worn bare; and there was no wage for him and for his army against Tyre, even for the service wherewith he served against it.
**19** Therefore thus saith Adonai the Lord: Behold, I give unto Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon the land of Egypt; and he shall seize her abundance, and shall plunder her plunder, and shall strip her spoils;
**20** and it shall be a wage for his army, for his service wherewith he served against Tyre, I have given him the land of Egypt, for all that they have done for Me.
**21** Thus saith Adonai the Lord: In that day I will cause a horn to bud forth for all the house of Israel, and I will give unto thee an open mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I am the Lord.
