ΚΕΦ. Λ´. XXX.

17 ῥῆγμα, καὶ διαχυθήσεται ὕδατα. Νεανίσκοι Ἡλιουπόλεως καὶ
Βουβάστου ἐν μαχαίρᾳ πεσοῦνται, καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες ἐν αἰχμαλω-
σίᾳ πορεύσονται. καὶ ἐν Τάφναις συσκοτάσει ἡ ἡμέρα, ἐν τῷ συν- 18
τρῖψαι με ἐκεῖ τὰ σκῆπτρα Αἰγύπτου, καὶ ἀπωλεῖται ἐκεῖ ἡ ὕ-
βρις τῆς ἰσχύος αὐτῆς, καὶ αὐτὴν νεφέλη καλύψει, καὶ αἱ θυ-
γατέρες αὐτῆς αἰχμάλωτοι ἀχθήσονται. Καὶ ποιήσω κρῖμα ἐν 19
Αἰγύπτῳ, καὶ γνώσονται ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι Κύριος. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν 20
τῷ ἑνδεκάτῳ ἔτει, ἐν τῷ πρώτῳ μηνὶ, ἑβδόμῃ τοῦ μηνὸς, ἐγέ-
νετο λόγος Κυρίου πρός με, λέγων· υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, τοὺς βραχί- 21
ονας Φαραὼ βασιλέως Αἰγύπτου συνέτριψα, καὶ ἰδοὺ οὐ κατεδέθη
τοῦ δοθῆναι ἴασιν ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸν, τοῦ δοθῆναι μάλαγμα, τοῦ δοθῆναι
ἰσχὺν ἐπιλαβέσθαι μαχαίρας. Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Κύριος 22
Κύριος· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐπὶ Φαραὼ βασιλέα Αἰγύπτου, καὶ συν-
τρίψω τοὺς βραχίονας αὐτοῦ τοὺς ἰσχυροὺς, καὶ τοὺς τεταμένους,
καὶ τοὺς συντριβομένους, καὶ καταβαλῶ τὴν μάχαιραν αὐτοῦ ἐκ
τῆς χειρὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ διασπερῶ Αἴγυπτον εἰς τὰ ἔθνη, καὶ λικ- 23
μήσω αὐτοὺς εἰς τὰς χώρας, καὶ κατισχύσω τοὺς βραχίονας 24
βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος, καὶ δώσω τὴν ῥομφαίαν μου εἰς τὴν χεῖρα
αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπάξει αὐτὴν ἐπ᾽ Αἴγυπτον, καὶ προνομεύσει τὴν
προνομὴν αὐτῆς, καὶ σκυλεύσει τὰ σκῦλα αὐτῆς· καὶ ἐνισχύσω 25
τοὺς βραχίονας βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος, οἱ δὲ βραχίονες Φαραὼ
πεσοῦνται· καὶ γνώσονται ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι Κύριος, ἐν τῷ δοῦναί με
τὴν ῥομφαίαν μου εἰς χεῖρας βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος, καὶ ἐκτενεῖ
αὐτὴν ἐπὶ γῆν Αἰγύπτου. Καὶ διασπερῶ Αἴγυπτον εἰς τὰ ἔθνη, 26
καὶ λικμήσω αὐτοὺς εἰς τὰς χώρας, καὶ ἐπιγνώσονται πάντες οἱ
Αἰγύπτιοι, ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι Κύριος.

ΚΕΦ. ΛΑʹ. XXXI.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἑνδεκάτῳ ἔτει, ἐν τῷ τρίτῳ μηνὶ, μιᾷ
τοῦ μηνὸς, ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρός με, λέγων· υἱὲ ἀνθρώ- 2
που, εἰπὸν πρὸς Φαραὼ βασιλέα Αἰγύπτου, καὶ τῷ πλήθει αὐτοῦ·
τίνι ὡμοίωσας σεαυτὸν ἐν τῷ ὕψει σου; Ἰδοὺ Ἀσσοὺρ κυπάρισ- 3
σος ἐν τῷ Λιβάνῳ, καὶ καλὸς ταῖς παραφυάσιν, καὶ πυκνὸς ἐν τῇ
σκέπῃ, καὶ ὑψηλὸς τῷ μεγέθει, καὶ εἰς μέσον τῶν νεφελῶν ἐγέ-
νετο ἡ ἀρχὴ αὐτοῦ, ὕδωρ ἐξέθρεψεν αὐτὸν, ἡ ἄβυσσος ὕψωσεν 4

**Chapter 30**

**17** ...breach, and waters shall be poured out. The young men of Heliopolis and Bubastis shall fall by the sword, and the women shall go forth into captivity.
**18** And in Tahpanhes shall the day be darkened, when I shall there break the scepters of Egypt, and the pride of her strength shall perish there; and a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall be led away captive.
**19** And I shall execute judgment in Egypt, and they shall know that I am the Lord.

**20** And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, on the seventh day of the month, the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
**21** "Son of man, the arms of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, have I broken; and behold, it was not bound up to give him healing, nor to apply a poultice, nor to give strength to lay hold of a sword."
**22** Therefore thus saith the Lord God: "Behold, I am against Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and I will break his arms, both the strong and the stretched out, and those that are broken; and I will cause his sword to fall from his hand.
**23** And I will scatter Egypt among the nations, and I will winnow them into the lands.
**24** And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and I will put My sword into his hand; and he shall bring it upon Egypt, and he shall plunder her plunder, and he shall spoil her spoils.
**25** And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, but the arms of Pharaoh shall fall; and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall put My sword into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt.
**26** And I will scatter Egypt among the nations, and I will winnow them into the lands; and all the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord."

**Chapter 31**

**1** And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, on the first day of the month, the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
**2** "Son of man, speak unto Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and unto his multitude, saying, 'To whom hast thou likened thyself in thy height?
**3** Behold, Asshur [was like] a cypress in Lebanon, fair in its shoots, and thick in its shade, and high in its stature; and its crown was among the clouds.
**4** The waters nourished it, the deep made it grow tall,"
