ΚΕΦ. ΚΓʹ.               ΙΕΡΕΜΙΑΣ
**35** τως ἐρεῖτε ἕκαστος πρὸς τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἕκαστος πρὸς
    τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ· τί ἀπεκρίθη Κύριος, καὶ τί ἐλάλησε Κύριος·
**36** Καὶ λῆμμα Κυρίου μὴ ὀνομάζετε ἔτι, ὅτι τὸ λῆμμα Κυρίου
    ἔσται τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ ὁ λόγος αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐξεστρέψατε τοὺς λό-
**37** γους Θεοῦ ζῶντος, Κυρίου τῶν δυνάμεων, Θεοῦ ἡμῶν. Οὕτως
    ἐρεῖτε πρὸς τὸν προφήτην· τί ἀπεκρίθη σοι Κύριος, καὶ τί ἐλά-
**38** λησε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν; Καὶ λῆμμα Κυρίου μὴ εἴπῃτε. Διὰ
    τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεός· ἀνθ᾿ ὧν εἴπατε τὸν λόγον τοῦ-
    τον, λῆμμα Κυρίου, καὶ ἀπέστειλα πρὸς ὑμᾶς, λέγων, οὐκ ἐρεῖτε
**39** λῆμμα Κυρίου. Διὰ τοῦτο ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ λαμβάνω ὑμᾶς λήμματι,
    καὶ ῥάσσω ὑμᾶς καὶ τὴν πόλιν, ἣν ἔδωκα ὑμῖν καὶ τοῖς πατρά-
**40** σιν ὑμῶν, ἀπὸ προσώπου μου. Καὶ δώσω ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς ὀνειδισμὸν
**7** αἰώνιον, καὶ ἀτιμίαν αἰώνιον, ἥτις οὐκ ἐπιλησθήσεται. Διὰ τοῦτο
    ἰδοὺ ἡμέραι ἔρχονται, λέγει Κύριος, καὶ οὐκ ἐροῦσιν ἔτι, ζῇ
**8** Κύριος, ὃς ἀνήγαγε τὸν οἶκον Ἰσραὴλ ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, ἀλλὰ
    ζῇ Κύριος, ὃς συνήγαγεν ἅπαν τὸ σπέρμα Ἰσραὴλ ἀπὸ γῆς βορρᾶ,
    καὶ ἀπὸ πασῶν τῶν χωρῶν, οὗ ἔξωσεν αὐτοὺς ἐκεῖ, καὶ ἀπεκατέ-
    στησεν αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν.

                          ΚΕΦ. ΚΔ΄. XXIV.

**1** ΚΑΙ ἔδειξέ μοι Κύριος δύο καλάθους σύκων, κειμένους κατὰ
    πρόσωπον ναοῦ Κυρίου, μετὰ τὸ ἀποικίσαι Ναβουχοδονόσορ βα-
    σιλέα Βαβυλῶνος τὸν Ἰεχονίαν υἱὸν Ἰωακεὶμ βασιλέα Ἰούδα,
    καὶ τοὺς ἄρχοντας βασιλέως Ἰούδα, καὶ τοὺς τεχνίτας, καὶ
    τοὺς δεσμώτας, καὶ τοὺς πλουσίους ἐξ Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἤγαγεν
**2** αὐτοὺς εἰς Βαβυλῶνα. Ὁ κάλαθος ὁ εἷς σύκων χρηστῶν σφόδρα,
    ὡς τὰ σύκα τὰ πρώϊμα· καὶ ὁ κάλαθος ὁ ἕτερος σύκων πονη-
**3** ρῶν σφόδρα, ἃ οὐ βρωθήσεται ἀπὸ πονηρίας αὐτῶν. Καὶ εἶπε
    Κύριος πρὸς με· τί σὺ ὁρᾷς Ἱερεμία; καὶ εἶπα, σύκα· καὶ τὰ
    σύκα τὰ χρηστά, χρηστὰ λίαν· καὶ τὰ πονηρά, πονηρὰ λίαν, ἃ οὐ
**4** βρωθήσεται ἀπὸ πονηρίας αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου
**5** πρὸς με λέγων. Τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ· ὡς τὰ σύκα
    τὰ χρηστὰ ταῦτα, οὕτως ἐπιγνώσομαι τοὺς ἀποικισθέντας Ἰού-
    δα, οὓς ἐξαπέσταλκα ἐκ τοῦ τόπου τούτου εἰς γῆν Χαλδαίων
**6** εἰς ἀγαθά. Καὶ στηριῶ τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς μου ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς εἰς ἀγα-
    θά, καὶ ἀποκαταστήσω αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν γῆν ταύτην εἰς ἀγαθά·

**Jeremiah 23**
**35** Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbor, and every one to his brother: 'What hath the Lord answered?' and 'What hath the Lord spoken?'
**36** And ye shall no more name 'The burden of the Lord'; for the burden of the Lord shall be to the man his own word. For ye have perverted the words of the living God, the Lord of hosts, our God.
**37** Thus shall ye say to the prophet: 'What hath the Lord answered thee?' and 'What hath the Lord our God spoken?'
**38** And ye shall not say, 'The burden of the Lord.' Therefore thus saith the Lord God: 'Because ye have spoken this word, "The burden of the Lord," and I sent unto you, saying, "Ye shall not say, 'The burden of the Lord,'"'
**39** Therefore, behold, I will take you up as a burden, and will cast you off, and the city which I gave unto you and to your fathers, from My presence.
**40** And I will bring upon you an everlasting reproach, and an everlasting shame, which shall not be forgotten.
**7** [Even] everlasting reproach, and everlasting shame, which shall not be forgotten. Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that they shall no more say, 'The Lord liveth,'
**8** [Who brought up the house of Israel from the land of Egypt;] but, 'The Lord liveth,' Who hath gathered all the seed of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the lands whither He had driven them out, and hath restored them unto their own land.

**Jeremiah 24**
**1** And the Lord showed me two baskets of figs, set before the Temple of the Lord, after Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried into exile Jechoniah the son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, and the princes of the king of Judah, with the craftsmen, and the prisoners, and the wealthy from Jerusalem, and had brought
**2** them unto Babylon. One basket had very good figs, as the first-ripe figs; and the other basket had very bad figs, which could not be eaten for their badness.
**3** And the Lord said unto me, 'What seest thou, Jeremiah?' And I said, 'Figs; and the good figs are exceedingly good, and the bad ones are exceedingly bad, which cannot be eaten for their badness.'
**4** And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
**5** 'Thus saith the Lord God of Israel: "Like these good figs, so will I regard the exiles of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for their good.
**6** For I will set Mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again unto this land for good;"
