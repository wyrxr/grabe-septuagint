ΠΑΡΟΙΜΙΑΙ. ΚΕΦ. ϛʹ. Ζʹ.
30 Οὐ θαυμαστὸν ἐάν τις ἁλῷ κλέπτων· κλέπτει γὰρ ἵνα ἐμπλήσῃ
31 ψυχὴν πεινῶν· ἐὰν δὲ ἁλῷ, ἀποτίσει ἑπταπλάσια, καὶ πάντα τὰ
    ὑπάρχοντα αὐτοῦ δὺς ῥύσεται ἑαυτόν.
32 Ὁ δὲ μοιχὸς δι᾿ ἔνδειαν φρενῶν ἀπώλειαν τῇ ψυχῇ αὐτοῦ περιποιεῖται,
    ὀδύνας τε καὶ ἀτιμίαν ὑποφέρει·
33 τὸ δὲ ὄνειδος αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἐξαλειφθήσεται εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα.
34 Μεστὸς γὰρ ζήλου θυμὸς ἀνδρὸς αὐτῆς· οὐ φείσεται ἐν
    ἡμέρᾳ κρίσεως·
35 οὐκ ἀνταλλάξεται οὐδενὸς λύτρου τὴν ἔχθραν, οὐδὲ μὴ διὰ πολλῶν δώρων.

ΚΕΦ. Ζʹ. VII.

1 Υἱὲ φύλασσε ἐμοὺς λόγους, τὰς δὲ ἐμὰς ἐντολὰς κρύψον παρὰ
    σεαυτῷ· υἱέ τίμα τὸν Κύριον, καὶ ἰσχύσεις· πλὴν δὲ αὐτοῦ μὴ
    φοβοῦ ἄλλον.
2 Φύλαξον ἐμὰς ἐντολὰς, καὶ βιώσεις, τοὺς δὲ ἐμοὺς λόγους ὥσπερ
    κόρας ὀμμάτων·
3 περίθου αὐτοὺς σοῖς δακτύλοις, ἐπίγραφον δὲ ἐπὶ πλακὸς τῆς καρδίας
    σου.
4 Εἶπον τὴν σοφίαν σὴν ἀδελφὴν εἶναι, τὴν δὲ φρόνησιν γνώριμον
    περιποίησαι σεαυτῷ·
5 ἵνα σε τηρήσῃ ἀπὸ γυναικὸς ἀλλοτρίας καὶ πονηρᾶς, ἐάν σε λόγοις
    τοῖς πρὸς χάριν ἐμβάληται.
6 Ἀπὸ γὰρ θυρίδος ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου αὐτῆς εἰς τὰς πλατείας παρακύπτουσα,
7 ὃν ἂν ἴδῃ τῶν ἀφρόνων τέκνων νεανίαν ἐνδεῆ φρενῶν,
8 παραπορευόμενον ἐν ἀγορᾷ παρὰ γωνίαν ἐν διόδοις οἴκων αὐτῆς,
9 καὶ ἁλῶντα ἐν σκότει ἑσπερινῷ, ἡνίκα ἂν ἡσυχία νυκτερινὴ ἢ καὶ γνόφος·
10 ἡ δὲ γυνὴ συναντᾷ αὐτῷ, εἶδος ἔχουσα πορνικὸν, ἢ ποιεῖ νέων
    ἐξίπτασθαι καρδίας· ἀνεπτερωμένη δέ ἐστι καὶ ἄσωτος. ἐν οἴκῳ δὲ
    οὐχ ἡσυχάζουσιν οἱ
11 πόδες αὐτῆς· χρόνον γάρ τινα ἔξω ῥέμβεται, χρόνον δὲ ἐν πλατείαις
    παρὰ πᾶσαν γωνίαν ἐνεδρεύει.
13 Εἶτα ἐπιλαβομένη ἐφίλησεν αὐτὸν, ἀναιδεῖ δὲ προσώπῳ προσεῖπεν
    αὐτῷ·
14 θυσία εἰρηνική μοι ἐστὶ, σήμερον ἀποδίδωμι τὰς εὐχάς μου·
15 ἕνεκα τούτου ἐξῆλθον εἰς συνάντησίν σου, ποθοῦσα τὸ σὸν πρόσωπον,
    εὕρηκά σε.
16 Κειρίαις τέτακα τὴν κλίνην μου, ἀμφιτάποις δὲ ἔστρωκα τοῖς ἀπ᾿
    Αἰγύπτου·
17 διέφραγκα τὴν κοίτην μου κρόκῳ, τὸν δὲ οἶκόν μου κινναμώμῳ·
18 ἐλθὲ καὶ ἀπολαύσωμεν ἐν φιλίας ἕως ὄρθρου, δεῦρο καὶ ἐγκοιλισθῶμεν
    ἔρωτι·
19 οὐ γὰρ πάρεστιν ὁ ἀνὴρ μου ἐν οἴκῳ, πεπόρευται (δὲ) ὁδὸν μακράν·
20 ἔνδεσμον ἀργυρίου λαβὼν ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ, δι᾽ ἡμερῶν πολλῶν
    ἐπανήξει εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ.
21 Ἀπεπλάνησε δὲ αὐτὸν

**PROVERBS.**
**CHAPTER VI.**

30 It is no marvel if a man be apprehended stealing,
    For he stealeth to satisfy his hungry soul.
31 But if he be caught, he shall restore sevenfold,
    And, giving all the possessions of his house, shall he redeem himself.
32 But the adulterer, for want of understanding,
    Doth procure destruction for his own soul;
    And he shall suffer both pains and dishonour,
33 And his reproach shall not be blotted out for evermore.
34 For the wrath of her husband is full of jealousy;
    He shall not spare in the day of judgment;
35 He will not accept any ransom for the enmity,
    Nor shall he be appeased by many gifts.

**CHAPTER VII.**

1 My son, keep my words,
    And lay up my commandments with thee;
    My son, honor the Lord, and thou shalt be strong;
    And beside Him, fear thou no other.
2 Keep my commandments, and thou shalt live;
    And my words as the apple of thine eyes.
3 Bind them upon thy fingers,
    And write them upon the tablet of thy heart.
4 Say unto Wisdom, "Thou art my sister,"
    And gain unto thyself Understanding as a kinswoman;
5 That she may keep thee from the strange woman and the wicked,
    If she cast upon thee words of favour.
6 For from the window of her house,
    Peering forth into the streets,
7 She beholdeth among the foolish children
    A young man void of understanding,
8 Passing by in the marketplace near a corner,
    In the thoroughfares of her houses,
9 And being caught in the evening darkness,
    When there is nocturnal quiet, or even gloom.
10 Then a woman doth meet him, having a harlot's attire,
    And she maketh the hearts of young men to fly out;
    For she is restless and profligate.
    And her feet do not abide quietly in her house;
11 For some time she wandereth without,
    And some time in the streets doth she lie in wait at every corner.
13 Then she laid hold on him and kissed him,
    And with an impudent face she spake unto him:
14 "A sacrifice of peace offerings is with me;
    This day have I paid my vows.
15 For this cause I came forth to meet thee,
    Desiring earnestly thy face, and I have found thee.
16 With cords have I spread my bed,
    And with tapestries have I covered it, even those from Egypt;
17 I have perfumed my bed with saffron,
    And my house with cinnamon;
18 Come, and let us delight ourselves in [acts of] friendship until the morning,
    Come, and let us wallow in love;
19 For my husband is not at home;
    But he hath gone a long journey;
20 He hath taken a bag of silver in his hand,
    And after many days he will return to his house."
21 And she led him astray.
