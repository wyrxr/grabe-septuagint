Ἐγὼ ἐλάλησα, ἐγὼ ἐκάλεσα, 15
ἤγαγον αὐτόν, καὶ εὐώδωσα τὴν ὁδὸν αὐτοῦ. Προσαγάγετε πρὸς 16
μέ, καὶ ἀκούσατε ταῦτα, οὐκ ἀπ᾿ ἀρχῆς ἐν κρυφῇ ἐλάλησα,
οὐδὲ ἐν τόπῳ γῆς σκοτεινῷ· ἡνίκα ἐγένετο, ἐκεῖ ἤμην, καὶ νῦν
Κύριος Κύριος ἀπέσταλκέ με, καὶ τὸ πνεῦμα αὐτοῦ. Οὕτως 17
λέγει Κύριος, ὁ ῥυσάμενός σε, ὁ ἅγιος Ἰσραήλ· ἐγὼ εἰμι ὁ Θεός
σου, δέδειχα σοι εἰς ὠφέλειαν τοῦ εὑρεῖν σε τὴν ὁδὸν, ἐν ᾗ πο-
ρεύσῃ ἐν αὐτῇ. Καὶ εἰ ἤκουσας τῶν ἐντολῶν μου, ἐγένετο ἂν 18
ὡσεὶ ποταμὸς ἡ εἰρήνη σου, καὶ ἡ δικαιοσύνη σου ὡς κῦμα
θαλάσσης. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἂν ὡσεὶ ἄμμος τὸ σπέρμα σου, καὶ τὰ 19
ἔκγονα τῆς κοιλίας σου ὡς ὁ χοῦς τῆς γῆς· οὐδὲ νῦν οὐ μὴ
ἐξολεθρευθῇς, οὐδὲ ἀπολεῖται τὸ ὄνομά σου ἐνώπιον μου. Ἔξελθε 20
ἐκ Βαβυλῶνος φεύγων ἀπὸ τῶν Χαλδαίων, φωνὴν εὐφροσύνης
ἀναγγείλατε, καὶ ἀκουστὸν γενέσθω τοῦτο, ἀπαγγείλατε ἕως
ἐσχάτου τῆς γῆς· λέγετε, ἐρύσατο Κύριος τὸν δοῦλον αὐτοῦ Ἰα-
κὼβ, καὶ ἐὰν διψήσωσι, δι᾿ ἐρήμου ἄξει αὐτοὺς, ὕδωρ ἐκ πέτρας 21
ἐξάξει αὐτοῖς, σχισθήσεται πέτρα, καὶ ῥυήσεται ὕδωρ, καὶ πίε-
ται ὁ λαός μου, Οὐκ ἔστι χαίρειν τοῖς ἀσεβέσι, λέγει Κύριος. 22

ΚΕΦ. ΜΘ΄. XLIX.

ΑΚΟΥΣΑΤΕ μου νῆσοι, καὶ προσέχετε ἔθνη, διὰ χρόνου πολ- 1
λοῦ στήσεται, λέγει Κύριος· ἐκ γαστρὸς ἐκάλεσέ με καὶ ἐκ κοιλίας
μητρός μου ἐκάλεσε τὸ ὄνομά μου, καὶ ἔθηκε τὸ στόμα μου ὡσεὶ 2
μάχαιραν ὀξεῖαν, καὶ ὑπὸ τὴν σκέπην τῆς χειρὸς αὐτοῦ ἔκρυψέ με·
ἔθηκε με ὡς βέλος ἐκλεκτὸν, καὶ ἐν τῇ φαρέτρα αὐτοῦ ἔκρυψέ με,
καὶ εἶπέ μοι· δοῦλός μου εἶ σὺ Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ ἐν σοὶ δοξασθήσομαι. 3
Καὶ ἐγὼ εἶπα· κενῶς ἐκοπίασα, καὶ εἰς μάταιον καὶ εἰς οὐδὲν ἐ- 4
δωκα τὴν ἰσχύν μου· διὰ τοῦτο ἡ κρίσις μου παρὰ Κυρίῳ, καὶ ὁ
πόνος μου ἐναντίον τοῦ Θεοῦ μου. Καὶ νῦν οὕτως λέγει Κύριος, 5
ὁ πλάσας με ἐκ κοιλίας δοῦλον ἑαυτῷ, τοῦ συναγαγεῖν τὸν Ἰα-
κὼβ καὶ Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς αὐτόν· συναχθήσομαι καὶ δοξασθήσομαι
ἐναντίον Κυρίου, καὶ ὁ Θεός μου ἔσται μου ἰσχύς. Καὶ εἶπέ μοι· 6
μέγα σοι ἐστὶ τοῦ κληθῆναί σε παῖδα μου, τοῦ στῆσαι τὰς φυλὰς
Ἰακὼβ, καὶ τὴν διασπορὰν τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ ἐπιστρέψαι· ἰδοὺ τέθεικά
σε εἰς φῶς ἐθνῶν, τοῦ εἶναί σε εἰς σωτηρίαν ἕως ἐσχάτου τῆς
γῆς. Οὕτως λέγει Κύριος, ὁ ῥυσάμενός σε, ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ· 7

#### Chapter 48

**15** I have spoken, I have called,
    I have brought him forth, and I have prospered his way.
**16** Draw ye near unto Me, and hear these things:
    Not from the beginning did I speak in secret,
    nor in a dark place of the earth;
    when it came to pass, there was I.
    And now, the Lord, even the Lord, hath sent Me, and His Spirit.
**17** Thus saith the Lord, He that hath redeemed thee,
    the Holy One of Israel:
    I am thy God; I have shown unto thee for [thine] advantage,
    that thou mightest find the way wherein thou shalt walk.
**18** And if thou hadst hearkened unto My commandments,
    then would thy peace have been as a river,
    and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea.
**19** And then would thy seed have been as the sand,
    and the offspring of thy womb as the dust of the earth.
    [Yet] even now shalt thou not be utterly destroyed,
    neither shall thy name perish from before Me.
**20** Go forth from Babylon, fleeing from the Chaldeans!
    Announce ye with a voice of gladness, and let this be heard;
    declare ye even to the uttermost part of the earth, saying:
    'The Lord hath delivered His servant Jacob!'
**21** And if they thirst, He shall lead them through a desert;
    He shall bring forth for them water out of a rock;
    a rock shall be cleft, and water shall flow,
    and My people shall drink.
**22** There is no peace for the ungodly, saith the Lord.

#### Chapter 49

**1** Hearken unto Me, O islands; and give heed, O nations.
    After a long time shall it be established, saith the Lord.
    From the womb He called me,
    and from the belly of my mother He called my name.
**2** And He hath made my mouth as a sharp sword;
    and under the shadow of His hand He hid me.
    He hath made me as a choice arrow,
    and in His quiver He hid me.
**3** And He said unto me, 'Thou art My servant, O Israel,
    and in thee shall I be glorified.'
**4** And I said, 'I have labored in vain,
    and for nothing and for naught have I spent my strength.'
    Therefore my vindication is with the Lord,
    and my labor is before my God.
**5** And now thus saith the Lord, He that formed me from the womb
    to be a servant unto Himself,
    to gather Jacob and Israel unto Him;
    I shall be gathered and glorified before the Lord,
    and my God shall be my strength.
**6** And He said unto me, 'It is a great thing for thee
    that thou shouldst be called My servant,
    to raise up the tribes of Jacob,
    and to bring back the dispersion of Israel.
    Behold, I have set thee for a light to the Gentiles,
    that thou shouldst be for salvation unto the uttermost part of the earth.'
**7** Thus saith the Lord, He that hath redeemed thee,
    the God of Israel:
