**9.** Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἔνδυσαι τὴν ἰσχὺν τοῦ βραχίονός σου, ἐξεγείρου ὡς ἐν ἀρχῇ ἡμέρας, ὡς γενεὰ αἰῶνος· οὐ σὺ εἶ ἡ λατομήσασα πλάτος, διαῤῥήξασα δράκοντα;
**10.** οὐ σὺ εἶ ἡ ἐρημοῦσα θάλασσαν, ὕδωρ ἀβύσσου πλῆθος; ἡ θεῖσα τὰ βάθη τῆς θαλάσσης ὁδὸν διαβάσεως ῥυομένους, καὶ λελυτρωμένους;
**11.** ὑπὸ γὰρ Κυρίου ἀποστραφήσονται, καὶ ἥξουσιν εἰς Σιὼν μετ’ εὐφροσύνης καὶ ἀγαλλιάματος αἰωνίου· ἐπὶ γὰρ τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτῶν ἀγαλλίαμα καὶ αἴνεσις, καὶ εὐφροσύνη καταλήψεται αὐτούς· ἀπέδρα ὀδύνη καὶ λύπη καὶ στεναγμός·
**12.** ἐγώ εἰμι, ἐγώ εἰμι αὐτὸς ὁ παρακαλῶν σε, γνῶθι, τίς οὖσα ἐφοβήθης ἀπὸ ἀνθρώπου θνητοῦ, καὶ ἀπὸ υἱοῦ ἀνθρώπου, οἱ ὡσεὶ χόρτος ἐξηράνθησαν.
**13.** Καὶ ἐπελάθου Θεὸν τὸν ποιήσαντά σε, τὸν ποιήσαντα τὸν οὐρανὸν, καὶ θεμελιώσαντα τὴν γῆν· καὶ ἐφοβοῦ ἀεὶ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας τὸ πρόσωπον τοῦ θυμοῦ τοῦ θλίβοντός σε· ὃν τρόπον γὰρ ἐβουλεύσατο τοῦ ἆραί σε, καὶ νῦν ποῦ ὁ θυμὸς τοῦ θλίβοντός σε;
**14.** Ἐν γὰρ τῷ σώζεσθαί σε, οὐ στήσεται, οὐδὲ χρονιεῖ· καὶ οὐ θανατώσει εἰς διαφθοράν, καὶ οὐ μὴ ὑστερήσει ἄρτος αὐτοῦ.
**15.** Ὅτι ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου, ὁ ταράσσων τὴν θάλασσαν, καὶ ἠχῶν τὰ κύματα αὐτῆς, Κύριος Σαβαὼθ ὄνομά μοι.
**16.** Θήσω τοὺς λόγους μου εἰς τὸ στόμα σου, καὶ ὑπὸ τὴν σκιὰν τῆς χειρός σκεπάσω σε, ἐν ᾗ ἔστησα τὸν οὐρανὸν, καὶ ἐθεμελίωσα τὴν γῆν, καὶ ἐρεῖ Σιὼν, λαός μου εἶ σύ.
**17.** Ἐξεγείρου, ἐξεγείρου, ἀνάστηθι Ἱερουσαλήμ, ἡ πιοῦσα τὸ ποτήριον τοῦ θυμοῦ αὐτοῦ, ἐκ χειρὸς Κυρίου· τὸ ποτήριον γὰρ τῆς πτώσεως, τὸ κόνδυ τοῦ θυμοῦ ἔπιες καὶ ἐξεκένωσας,
**18.** καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ παρακαλῶν σε ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν τέκνων σου ὧν ἔτεκες, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ ἀντιλαμβανόμενος τῆς χειρός σου, οὐδὲ ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν υἱῶν σου ὧν ὕψωσας.
**19.** Δύο ταῦτα ἀντικείμενά σοι, τίς σοι συλλυπηθήσεται; πτῶμα καὶ σύντριμμα, λιμὸς καὶ μάχαιρα· τίς σε παρακαλέσει;
**20.** Οἱ υἱοί σου, οἱ ἀπορούμενοι, οἱ καθεύδοντες ἐπ’ ἄκρου πάσης ἐξόδου ὡς σευτλίον ἡμίεφθον, οἱ πλήρεις θυμοῦ Κυρίου, ἐκλελυμένοι διὰ Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ σου.
**21.** Διὰ τοῦτο ἄκουε τοῦτο τεταπεινωμένη, καὶ μεθύουσα οὐκ ἀπὸ οἴνου.
**22.** Οὕτως λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὁ κρίνων τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ· ἰδοὺ εἴληφα ἐκ τῆς χειρός σου τὸ ποτήριον τῆς πτώσεως, τὸ κόνδυ τοῦ θυμοῦ μου, καὶ οὐ προσθήσῃ ἔτι πιεῖν αὐτὸ,
**23.** καὶ δώσω αὐτὸ εἰς τὰς χεῖρας τῶν ἀδικησάντων σε καὶ τῶν ταπεινωσάντων σε, οἳ εἶπαν τῇ ψυχῇ σου,

#### Chapter 51

**9** -salem; and clothe thyself with the strength of thine arm.
    Awake, as in the beginning of days,
    as in the generations of eternity.
    Art thou not she that didst hew the expanse,
    that didst rend the dragon?
**10** Art thou not she that made desolate the sea,
    the abundance of the water of the deep?
    That made the depths of the sea a way of passage
    for those delivered and for those redeemed?
**11** For by the Lord shall they return,
    and shall come unto Zion with joy and everlasting gladness.
    For upon their heads shall be gladness and praise,
    and joy shall overtake them;
    pain and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
**12** I, even I, am He that comforteth thee.
    Know this: who art thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of mortal man,
    and of the son of man,
    who are withered as grass?
**13** And hast thou forgotten God thy Maker,
    who hath made the heaven,
    and laid the foundations of the earth?
    And hast thou feared continually all the days
    the face of the wrath of him that afflicted thee?
    For after what manner he purposed to take thee away,
    [so now] where is the wrath of him that afflicted thee?
**14** For in thy salvation, he shall not stand,
    neither shall he tarry;
    and he shall not slay [thee] unto corruption,
    neither shall his bread fail.
**15** For I am the Lord thy God,
    who stirreth up the sea,
    and maketh the waves thereof to roar.
    The Lord Sabaoth is My Name.
**16** I will put My words in thy mouth,
    and under the shadow of the hand I will cover thee,
    by which I have established the heaven,
    and laid the foundations of the earth;
    and Zion shall say, "Thou art My people."
**17** Awake, awake, arise, O Jerusalem,
    thou that hast drunk the cup of His wrath from the hand of the Lord.
    For the cup of staggering,
    even the goblet of wrath,
    hast thou drunk and drained.
**18** And there was none to comfort thee
    among all thy children whom thou hast borne;
    neither was there any to take hold of thy hand,
    nor among all thy sons whom thou hast reared.
**19** These two things have befallen thee;
    who shall lament with thee?
    Desolation and destruction,
    famine and sword;
    who then shall comfort thee?
**20** Thy sons, they that are in despair,
    that lie down at the head of every street
    as a half-cooked beet;
    full of the wrath of the Lord,
    faint by the Lord thy God.
**21** Therefore hear thou this, O thou afflicted,
    and drunken, but not with wine.
**22** Thus saith the Lord God,
    who judgeth His people:
    Behold, I have taken out of thy hand the cup of staggering,
    even the goblet of My wrath;
    and thou shalt no more drink it again.
**23** And I will put it into the hands of them that have wronged thee,
    and of them that have brought thee low,
    who have said to thy soul,
