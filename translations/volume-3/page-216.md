13 οἶκοι ἐγκαταλελειμμένοι ἀπολοῦνται. Ταῦτα πάντα ἔσται ἐν τῇ
14 γῇ ἐν μέσῳ τῶν ἐθνῶν· ὃν τρόπον ἐάν τις καλαμήσηται ἐλαίαν,
15 οὕτως καλαμήσονται αὐτοὺς· καὶ ἐὰν παύσηται ὁ τρυγητὸς, οὗτοι
    φωνῇ βοήσονται, οἱ δὲ καταλειφθέντες ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς εὐφρανθήσονται
    ἅμα τῇ δόξῃ Κυρίου, ταραχθήσεται τὸ ὕδωρ τῆς θαλάσσης. Διὰ
16 τοῦτο ἡ δόξα Κυρίου ἐν ταῖς νήσοις ἔσται τῆς θαλάσσης, τὸ ὄ-
    νομα Κυρίου ἔνδοξον ἔσται. Κύριε ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ, ἀπὸ τῶν πτε-
    ρύγων τῆς γῆς τέρατα ἠκούσαμεν, ἐλπὶς τῷ εὐσεβεῖ· καὶ ἐροῦσι·
    τὸ μυστήριόν μου ἐμοί, τὸ μυστήριόν μου ἐμοί· οὐαὶ τοῖς ἀθετοῦσιν·
17 οἱ ἀθετοῦντες καὶ ἀθεσίαν ἀθετούντων τὸν νόμον, φόβος καὶ βό-
18 θυνος καὶ παγὶς ἐφ᾽ ὑμᾶς τοὺς ἐνοικοῦντας ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς. Καὶ
    ἔσται, ὁ φεύγων τὸν φόβον ἐμπεσεῖται εἰς τὸν βόθυνον· ὁ δὲ ἐκ-
    βαίνων ἐκ τοῦ βοθύνου, ἁλώσεται ὑπὸ τῆς παγίδος· ὅτι θυρίδες
    ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ἠνεῴχθησαν, καὶ σεισθήσεται τὰ θεμέλια τῆς γῆς.
19 Ταραχὴ ταραχθήσεται ἡ γῆ, καὶ ἀπορία ἀπορηθήσεται ἡ γῆ.
20 Ἔκλινε καὶ σεισθήσεται ὡς ὀπωροφυλάκιον ἡ γῆ, ὡς ὁ μεθύων
21 καὶ κραιπαλῶν, καὶ πεσεῖται, καὶ οὐ μὴ δύνηται ἀναστῆναι, κα-
    τίσχυσε γὰρ ἐπ᾽ αὐτῆς ἡ ἀνομία. Καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐ-
    κείνῃ, ἐπάξει ὁ Θεὸς ἐπὶ τὸν κόσμον τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ἐν τῷ ὕψει
22 τὴν χεῖρα, καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς βασιλεῖς τῆς γῆς ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς. Καὶ συνά-
    ξουσι συναγωγὴν αὐτῆς, καὶ ἀποκλείσουσιν εἰς ὀχύρωμα καὶ εἰς
23 δεσμωτήριον, διὰ πολλῶν γενεῶν ἐπισκοπὴ ἔσται αὐτῶν. Καὶ τα-
    κήσεται ἡ πλίνθος καὶ πεσεῖται τὸ τεῖχος· ὅτι βασιλεύει Κύριος
    ἐν τῷ ὄρει Σιὼν, καὶ ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ, καὶ ἐνώπιον τῶν πρεσβυ-
    τέρων δοξασθήσεται.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΕ΄. XXV.

1 (Ὠδὴ) Κύριε ὁ Θεός μου, δοξάσω σε, ὑμνήσω τὸ ὄνομά σου, ὅτι
    ἐποίησας θαυμαστὰ πράγματα, βουλὴν ἀρχαίαν ἀληθινήν· γέ-
2 νοιτο, Κύριε. Ὅτι ἔθηκας πόλεις εἰς χῶμα, πόλεις ὀχυρὰς τοῦ
    πεσεῖν αὐτῶν τὰ θεμέλια, τῶν ἀσεβῶν πόλις τὸν αἰῶνα οὐ μὴ
3 οἰκοδομηθῇ. Διὰ τοῦτο εὐλογήσει σε ὁ λαὸς ὁ πτωχὸς, καὶ πό-
4 λεις ἀνθρώπων ἀδικουμένων εὐλογήσουσι σε. Ἐγένου γὰρ πάσῃ
    πόλει ταπεινῇ βοηθὸς, καὶ τοῖς ἀθυμήσασι δι᾽ ἔνδειαν σκέπῃ,
    ἀπὸ ἀνθρώπων πονηρῶν ρύσῃ αὐτοὺς· σκέπῃ διψώντων, καὶ πνεῦμα

**Chapter 24**
**13** and abandoned houses shall perish. All these things shall be in the earth, in the midst of the nations.
**14** Even as when one doth glean an olive tree,
**15** so shall they glean them. And when the vintage doth cease, these shall cry aloud with a voice; but they that are left upon the earth shall rejoice together with the glory of the Lord; the water of the sea shall be troubled.
**16** Therefore shall the glory of the Lord be in the islands of the sea, the Name of the Lord shall be glorious. O Lord, the God of Israel, from the ends of the earth have we heard wonders, [even] hope for the godly; and they shall say, My mystery is to me, my mystery is to me. Woe unto them that deal treacherously!
**17** Those who deal treacherously, and the treachery of them that deal treacherously with the law, [yea, even] fear, and the pit, and the snare [shall be] upon you, O inhabitants of the earth.
**18** And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he who cometh up out of the pit shall be caught by the snare; for the windows of heaven were opened, and the foundations of the earth shall be shaken.
**19** With trouble shall the earth be troubled, and with perplexity shall the earth be utterly perplexed.
**20** The earth hath swayed and shall be shaken as a lodge for fruit-gatherers; as one that is drunken and reeling,
**21** so shall it fall, and shall in no wise be able to rise again, for iniquity hath prevailed upon it. And it shall come to pass in that day, that God shall bring His hand upon the host of heaven in the height,
**22** and upon the kings of the earth upon the earth. And they shall gather her host together, and shall shut them up in a stronghold and in a prison;
**23** and after many generations shall their visitation be. And the brick shall melt away, and the wall shall fall; for the Lord reigneth in Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before the elders shall He be glorified.

**Chapter 25**
**1** (A Song) O Lord, my God, I will glorify Thee, I will praise Thy name, for Thou hast done wondrous things, [even] an ancient and true counsel.
**2** Let it be, O Lord. For Thou hast made cities into a heap of rubble, strong cities, that their foundations might fall; the city of the ungodly shall in no wise be built for ever.
**3** Therefore shall the poor people bless Thee, and cities of oppressed men shall bless Thee.
**4** For Thou hast been a helper to every humble city, and a shelter to them that are disheartened by reason of want; from wicked men shalt Thou rescue them; [yea], a shelter for the thirsty, and a spirit
