7 ῥύσομαί σε καὶ τὴν πόλιν ταύτην, καὶ ὑπὲρ τῆς πόλεως ταύτης
ὑπερασπιῶ. Τοῦτο δέ σοι τὸ σημεῖον παρὰ Κυρίου, ὅτι ὁ
8 Θεὸς ποιήσει τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ στρέψω τὴν σκιὰν
τῶν ἀναβαθμῶν, οὓς κατέβη ὁ ἥλιος, τοὺς δέκα ἀναβαθμοὺς
τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ πατρός σου, ἀποστρέψω εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω τὸν ἥλιον
τοὺς δέκα ἀναβαθμούς· καὶ ἀνέβη ὁ ἥλιος τοὺς δέκα ἀναβαθ-
9 μοὺς, οὓς κατέβη ἡ σκιά. (Ὡιδή.) ΠΡΟΣΕΥΧΗ ΕΖΕΚΙΟΥ
ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ ΤΗΣ ΙΟΥΔΑΙΑΣ ΗΝΙΚΑ ΕΜΑΛΑΚΙΣΘΗ ΚΑΙ
10 ΑΝΕΣΤΗ ΕΚ ΤΗΣ ΜΑΛΑΚΙΑΣ ΑΥΤΟΥ. Ἐγὼ εἶπα ἐν
τῷ ὕψει τῶν ἡμερῶν μου, πορεύσομαι ἐν πύλαις ᾅδου, κατα-
11 λείψω τὰ ἔτη τὰ ἐπίλοιπα. Εἶπα οὐκέτι οὐ μὴ ἴδω τὸ σωτή-
ριον τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς ζώντων, οὐκέτι οὐ μὴ ἴδω ἄνθρωπον μετὰ
12 κατοικούντων· ἐξέλειπεν ἐκ τῆς συγγενείας μου, (κατέλιπον τὸ
ἐπίλοιπον τῆς ζωῆς μου,) ἐξῆλθε καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ, ὥσπερ
ὁ καταλύων σκηνὴν πήξας. Τὸ πνεῦμά μου παρ᾿ ἐμοὶ ἐγένετο,
13 ὡς ἱστὸς ἐρίθου ἐγγιζούσης ἐκτεμεῖν. Ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ
παρεδόθην ἕως πρωΐ ὡς λέοντι, οὕτως πάντα τὰ ὀστᾶ μου
συνέτριψεν, Ἀπὸ γὰρ τῆς ἡμέρας ἕως τῆς νυκτὸς παρεδόθην.
14 Ὡς χελιδὼν, οὕτως φωνήσω, καὶ ὡς περιστερὰ, οὕτως μελε-
τήσω· Ἐξέλιπον γὰρ μου οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ τοῦ βλέπειν εἰς τὸ ὕψος
τοῦ οὐρανοῦ πρὸς τὸν Κύριον, ὃς ἐξειλάτό με, καὶ ἀφείλατό
15 μου τὴν ὀδύνην τῆς ψυχῆς· καὶ αὐτὸς ἐποίησε καθοδήγησιν
16 πάντας ἐνιαυτούς μου. Κύριε, περὶ αὐτῆς γὰρ ἀνηγγέλθη σοι,
17 καὶ ἐξήγειράς μου τὴν πνοὴν, καὶ παρακληθεὶς ἔζησα. Ἰδοὺ
εἰς εἰρήνην πικρία μου· εἵλου γάρ μου τὴν ψυχὴν, ἵνα μὴ ἀπό-
18 ληται, καὶ ἀπέρριψας ὀπίσω μου πάσας τὰς ἁμαρτίας μου.
Οὐ γὰρ οἱ ἐν ᾅδου αἰνέσουσί σε, οὐδὲ οἱ ἀποθανόντες εὐλο-
19 γήσουσί σε, οὐδὲ ἐλπιοῦσιν οἱ ἐν ᾅδου τὴν ἐλεημοσύνην σου·
οἱ ζῶντες εὐλογήσουσί σε, ὃν τρόπον κἀγὼ· ἀπὸ γὰρ τῆς σή-
20 μερον παιδία ποιήσω, ἃ ἀναγγελοῦσι τὴν δικαιοσύνην σου, Κύ-
ριε, τῆς σωτηρίας μου· καὶ οὐ παύσομαι εὐλογῶν σε μετὰ
ψαλτηρίου πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς ζωῆς μου, κατέναντι τοῦ
21 οἴκου τοῦ Θεοῦ. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἡσαΐας πρὸς Ἑζεκίαν· λάβε πα-
λάθην ἐκ σύκων, καὶ τρίψον, καὶ κατάπλασαι ἐπὶ τὸ ἕλχος,
22 καὶ ὑγιὴς ἔσῃ. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἑζεκίας· τοῦτο τὸ σημεῖον, ὅτι ἀνα-
βήσομαι εἰς τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ;

#### Chapter 38

**7** and I will deliver thee and this city, and for this city will I defend it. And this shall be a sign unto thee from the Lord, that God will do this thing:
**8** Behold, I will turn back the shadow of the degrees, which the sun had descended, [even] the ten degrees of the house of thy father; I will turn back the sun ten degrees. And the sun ascended the ten degrees which the shadow had descended.
**9** **Ode: THE PRAYER OF HEZEKIAH, KING OF JUDAH, WHEN HE HAD BEEN SICK AND ROSE UP FROM HIS SICKNESS.**
**10** I said in the height of my days, "I shall go into the gates of Hades; I shall leave behind my remaining years.
**11** I said, 'No longer shall I ever see the salvation of God upon the land of the living; no longer shall I ever see man among the dwellers [on earth]. My generation hath failed from my kindred; (I have left the remainder of my life;) it hath gone forth and departed from me, as one who pulleth down a tent which he hath pitched. My spirit was [but weakly] within me,
**12** as a weaver's web that is about to be cut off. In that day was I given over, [as] unto a lion, until the morning; thus hath he crushed all my bones. For from day until night was I given over.
**13** As a swallow, so shall I cry out; and as a dove, so shall I mourn. For my eyes have failed from looking to the height of heaven unto the Lord, who delivered me, and took away from me the pain of my soul.
**14** And He Himself hath provided guidance for all my years.
**15** O Lord, concerning this very thing was it announced unto Thee, and Thou hast awakened my breath, and being comforted, I lived.
**16** Behold, my bitterness is turned to peace; for Thou didst choose my soul, that it should not perish, and Thou didst cast all my sins behind me.
**17** For they that are in Hades shall not praise Thee, neither shall the dead bless Thee, nor shall they that are in Hades hope for Thy mercy.
**18** The living shall bless Thee, even as I do this day. For from this day I will make children, who shall declare Thy righteousness, O Lord, my salvation;
**19** and I shall not cease blessing Thee with a psaltery all the days of my life, before the house of God."
**20** And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, "Take a cake of figs, and crush [it], and lay [it as] a plaster upon the boil."
**21** "And thou shalt be whole."
**22** And Hezekiah said, "Is this the sign, that I shall go up into the house of the Lord God?"
