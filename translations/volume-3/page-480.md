δεδομένη ἐκ τῶν ἀπαρχῶν τῶν ἁγίων τῆς γῆς, ἅγιον ἁγίων
13 ἀπὸ τῶν ὁρίων τῶν Λευιτῶν. Τοῖς δὲ Λευίταις τὰ ἐχόμενα τῶν
ὁρίων τῶν ἱερέων, μῆκος πέντε καὶ εἴκοσι χιλιάδες, καὶ εὖρος
δέκα χιλιάδες, πᾶν τὸ μῆκος πέντε καὶ εἴκοσι χιλιάδες, καὶ
14 εὖρος εἴκοσι χιλιάδες. Οὐ πραθήσεται ἐξ αὐτοῦ οὐδὲ κατα-
μετρηθήσεται, οὐδὲ ἀφαιρεθήσεται τὰ πρωτογεννήματα τῆς
15 γῆς, ὅτι ἅγιον ἐστὶ τῷ Κυρίῳ. Τὰς δὲ πέντε χιλιάδας τὰς
περισσὰς ἐπὶ τῷ πλάτει ἐπὶ ταῖς πέντε καὶ εἴκοσι χιλιάσι,
προτείχισμα ἔσται τῇ πόλει εἰς τὴν κατοικίαν καὶ εἰς διά-
16 στημα αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἔσται ἡ πόλις ἐν μέσῳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ταῦτα
τὰ μέτρα αὐτῆς· ἀπὸ τῶν πρὸς βορρᾶν, πεντακόσιοι καὶ τετρα-
κισχίλιοι, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν πρὸς νότον πεντακόσιοι καὶ τέσσαρες χι-
λιάδες, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν πρὸς ἀνατολὰς, πεντακόσιοι καὶ τέσσαρες
χιλιάδες, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν πρὸς θάλασσαν, τετρακισχιλίους καὶ πεν-
17 τακοσίους. Καὶ ἔσται διάστημα τῇ πόλει πρὸς βορρᾶν διακόσιοι
πεντήκοντα, καὶ πρὸς νότον διακόσιοι καὶ πεντήκοντα, καὶ πρὸς
ἀνατολὰς διακόσιοι πεντήκοντα, καὶ πρὸς θάλασσαν διακόσιοι
18 πεντήκοντα, καὶ τὸ περισσὸν τοῦ μήκους τὸ ἐχόμενον τῶν ἀ-
παρχῶν τῶν ἁγίων δέκα χιλιάδες πρὸς ἀνατολάς, καὶ δέκα χιλιάδες
πρὸς θάλασσαν· καὶ ἔσονται αἱ ἀπαρχαὶ τοῦ ἁγίου, καὶ ἔσται τὰ γεν-
19 νήματα αὐτῆς εἰς ἄρτους τοῖς ἐργαζομένοις τὴν πόλιν. Οἱ δὲ
ἐργαζόμενοι τὴν πόλιν ἐργῶνται αὐτὴν ἐκ πασῶν τῶν φυλῶν τοῦ
20 Ἰσραήλ, πᾶσα ἡ ἀπαρχὴ, πέντε καὶ εἴκοσι χιλιάδες ἐπὶ πέντε
καὶ εἴκοσι χιλιάδες· τετράγωνον ἀφοριεῖτε αὐτοῦ τὴν ἀπαρχὴν
21 τοῦ ἁγίου, ἀπὸ τῆς κατασχέσεως τῆς πόλεως. Τὸ δὲ περισσὸν
τῷ ἀφηγουμένῳ ἐκ τούτου, καὶ ἐκ τούτου ἀπὸ τῶν ἀπαρχῶν τοῦ
ἁγίου, καὶ εἰς τὴν κατάσχεσιν τῆς πόλεως κατὰ πρόσωπον ἐπὶ εἴ-
κοσι καὶ πέντε χιλιάδας μῆκος, ἕως τῶν ὁρίων τῶν πρὸς ἀνατολὰς
καὶ πρὸς θάλασσαν, ἐπὶ πρόσωπον ἐπὶ πέντε καὶ εἴκοσι χιλιάδας
ἕως τῶν ὁρίων τῶν πρὸς θάλασσαν, καὶ ἐχόμενα τῶν μερίδων
τοῦ ἀφηγουμένου· καὶ ἔσται ἡ ἀπαρχὴ τῶν ἁγίων καὶ τὸ ἁγία-
22 σμα τοῦ οἴκου ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῆς, καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς κατασχέσεως τῶν
Λευιτῶν, καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς κατασχέσεως τῆς πόλεως ἐν μέσῳ τῶν
ἀφηγουμένων, ἔσται ἀναμέσον τῶν ὁρίων Ἰούδα, καὶ ἀναμέσον
23 τῶν ὁρίων Βενιαμείν, τῶν ἀφηγουμένων ἔσται. Καὶ τὸ περισσὸν
τῶν φυλῶν, ἀπὸ τῶν πρὸς ἀνατολὰς, ἕως τῶν πρὸς θάλασσαν

¹³ But unto the Levites shall be the [portion] adjacent to the borders of the priests, a length of five and twenty thousand [measures], and a breadth of ten thousand [measures]; the entire length [thereof shall be] five and twenty thousand [measures], and the breadth twenty thousand [measures].
¹⁴ It shall not be sold thereof, neither shall it be alienated, nor shall the firstfruits of the land be taken away; for it is holy unto the Lord.
¹⁵ Now the five thousand [measures] that are the remainder in breadth, upon the five and twenty thousand [measures], it shall be a precinct for the city for habitation and for its open space;
¹⁶ and the city shall be in the midst thereof. And these are the measures thereof: from the north side, four thousand five hundred [measures]; and from the south side, four thousand five hundred [measures]; and from the east side, four thousand five hundred [measures]; and from the sea side, four thousand five hundred [measures].
¹⁷ And there shall be an open space unto the city, toward the north two hundred and fifty [measures], and toward the south two hundred and fifty [measures], and toward the east two hundred and fifty [measures], and toward the sea two hundred and fifty [measures].
¹⁸ And the remainder of the length, that which bordereth the holy oblations, [shall be] ten thousand [measures] toward the east, and ten thousand [measures] toward the sea. And these shall be the oblations of the holy [land], and its produce shall be for bread unto them that work the city.
¹⁹ And they that work the city shall work it out of all the tribes of Israel.

²¹ Now the remainder shall be for the prince, from this side and from that side, from the holy oblations, and from the possession of the city, [extending] over against a length of five and twenty thousand [measures], even unto the borders of the east and unto the sea; [and] over against five and twenty thousand [measures], even unto the borders of the sea, which border the portions of the prince.
²² And the oblation of the holy [places] and the sanctuary of the house shall be in the midst thereof; and from the possession of the Levites, and from the possession of the city, in the midst of the prince's [portions], it shall be between the borders of Judah, and between the borders of Benjamin. It shall be for the princes.
²³ And the remainder of the tribes: from the east side even unto the sea,
