οὗτοι ἀπὸ προσώπου μου, φησὶ Κύριος, καὶ τὸ γένος Ἰσραὴλ παύ-
σεται, γενέσθαι ἔθνος κατὰ προσώπου μου πάσας ἡμέρας, φησὶ
38 Κύριος. Ἰδοὺ ἡμέραι ἔρχονται, φησὶ Κύριος, καὶ οἰκοδομηθήσεται
πόλις τῷ Κυρίῳ ἀπὸ πύργου Ἀναμεὴλ, ἕως τῆς πύλης τῆς γω-
39 νίας, καὶ ἐξελεύσεται ἔτι τὸ σχοινίον τῆς διαμετρήσεως αὐτῆς
ἀπέναντι αὐτῶν ἕως βουνῶν Γαβὴρ, καὶ περικυκλωθήσεται κύκλῳ
40 ἐξ ἐκλεκτῶν λίθων, καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν κοιλάδα τῶν Φαγαρεὶμ, καὶ
τὴν σποδιὰν, καὶ πᾶσαν Ἀσαρημὼθ ἕως χειμάῤῥου Νάχαλ κέ-
δρων, ἕως γωνίας πύλης ἵππων ἀνατολῆς, ἁγίασμα τῷ Κυρίῳ,
καὶ οὐκέτι οὐ μὴ ἐκλίπῃ, καὶ οὐ μὴ καθαιρεθῇ ἕως τοῦ αἰῶνος.

1 Ὁ λόγος ὁ γενόμενος πρὸς Ἱερεμίαν παρὰ Κυρίου ἐν τῷ
ἐνιαυτῷ τῷ δεκάτῳ τῷ βασιλεῖ Ἰούδα Σεδεκία βασιλεῖ Ἰούδα,
οὗτος ὁ ἐνιαυτὸς ὀκτωκαιδέκατος τῷ βασιλεῖ Ναβουχοδονόσορ
2 βασιλεῖ Βαβυλῶνος. Καὶ δύναμις βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος ἐχαρά-
κωσεν ἐπὶ Ἱερουσαλὴμ, καὶ Ἱερεμίας ἐφυλάσσετο ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ τῆς
3 φυλακῆς, ἥ ἐστιν ἐν οἴκῳ τοῦ βασιλέως, ἐν ᾗ κατέκλεισεν αὐτὸν
ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἰούδα Σεδεκίας, λέγων· διατί σὺ προφητεύεις, λέγων;
οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος, ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ δίδωμι τὴν πόλιν ταύτην ἐν χερσὶ
4 βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος, καὶ λήψεται αὐτὴν, καὶ Σεδεκίας βασιλεὺς
Ἰούδα οὐ μὴ σωθῇ ἐκ χειρὸς βασιλέως τῶν Χαλδαίων, ὅτι
παραδόσει παραδοθήσεται εἰς χεῖρας βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος, καὶ
λαλήσει στόμα αὐτοῦ πρὸς στόμα αὐτοῦ, καὶ οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτοῦ
5 τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ ὄψονται, καὶ εἰσελεύσεται εἰς Βαβυλῶνα
Σεδεκίας, καὶ ἐκεῖ καθιεῖται ἕως οὗ ἐπισκέψομαι αὐτὸν, φησὶ Κύ-
6 ριος, ἔτι πολεμεῖτε τοὺς Χαλδαίους, εἰς οὓς μὴ κατευθύνῃτε. Καὶ
εἶπεν Ἱερεμίας· ΕΓΕΝΕΤΟ ΛΟΓΟΣ ΚΥΡΙΟΥ ΠΡΟΣ ΙΕΡΕ-
7 ΜΙΑΝ, ΛΕΓΩΝ· ἰδοὺ Ἀναμεὴλ υἱὸς Σαλὼμ, ἀδελφοῦ πατρός
σου ἔρχεται πρός σε, λέγων σοι· κτῆσαι σεαυτῷ τὸν ἀγρόν μου
8 τὸν ἐν Ἀναθὼθ, ὅτι σὺ κρῖμα παραλαβεῖν εἰς κτῆσιν. Καὶ ἦλθε
πρός με Ἀναμεὴλ υἱὸς Σαλὼμ, ἀδελφοῦ πατρός μου, κατὰ τὸν
λόγον Κυρίου εἰς τὴν αὐλὴν τῆς φυλακῆς, καὶ εἶπέ μοι· κτῆσαι
σεαυτῷ τὸν ἀγρόν μου τὸν ἐν γῇ Βενιαμεὶν τὸν ἐν Ἀναθὼθ, ὅτι
σοὶ κρῖμα κτῆσθαι αὐτὸν, καὶ σὴ ἡ ἀγχιστεία, καὶ σὺ πρε-

**JEREMIAH CHAPTER 38 [LXX] (Hebrew Chapter 31)**

**36** "If these ordinances cease from before My face," saith the Lord, "then shall the generation of Israel cease to be a nation before My face all the days," saith the Lord.
**38** "Behold, the days are coming," saith the Lord, "and the city shall be built unto the Lord, from the tower of Hanameel even unto the Corner Gate.
**39** And the measuring line thereof shall yet go forth opposite them, even unto the hills of Gareb; and it shall be encircled round about
**40** from chosen stones, and all the valley of the corpses, and the ashes, and all of Asharemot, even unto the brook of Kidron, unto the corner of the Horse Gate toward the east, [shall be] a sanctuary to the Lord. And it shall never more be forsaken, nor shall it be thrown down unto the age [of ages]."

**JEREMIAH CHAPTER 39 [LXX] (Hebrew Chapter 32)**

**1** The word that came unto Jeremiah from the Lord in the tenth year of Zedekiah, the king of Judah—this [being] the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon.
**2** And the army of the king of Babylon had encamped against Jerusalem. And Jeremiah was confined in the court of the guard, which is in the house of the king,
**3** wherein Zedekiah, the king of Judah, had shut him up, saying, "Wherefore dost thou prophesy, saying, 'Thus saith the Lord: Behold, I give this city into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;
**4** and Zedekiah, the king of Judah, shall by no means be saved from the hand of the king of the Chaldeans; for he shall surely be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon, and his mouth shall speak with his mouth, and his eyes shall see his eyes;
**5** and Zedekiah shall go into Babylon, and there shall he dwell until I visit him,' saith the Lord. 'Yet ye fight the Chaldeans, against whom ye shall not prosper.'"
**6** Then Jeremiah said, "The word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah, saying,
**7** 'Behold, Hanameel, the son of Shallum, thy father's brother, cometh unto thee, saying to thee: "Buy for thyself my field that is in Anathoth, for it is thy right to receive [it] for possession."'"
**8** And Hanameel, the son of Shallum, my father's brother, came unto me, according to the word of the Lord, into the court of the guard, and he said to me, "Buy for thyself my field that is in the land of Benjamin, that is in Anathoth; for it is thy right to buy it, and thine is the right of redemption, and thou art the elder [kin]."
