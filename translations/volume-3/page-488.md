1426 ΔΑΝΙΗΛ ΚΕΦ. Β´.
¹¹ ὅτι ὁ λόγος ὃν ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐπερωτᾷ, βαρὺς, καὶ ἕτερος οὐκ ἔστιν
ὃς ἀναγγελεῖ αὐτὸν ἐνώπιον τοῦ βασιλέως, ἀλλ᾽ ἢ θεοὶ, ὧν οὐκ
¹² ἔστιν ἡ κατοικία μετὰ πάσης σαρκός. Τότε ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐν θυμῷ
¹³ καὶ ὀργῇ εἶπεν ἀπολέσαι πάντας τοὺς σοφοὺς Βαβυλῶνος. Καὶ
τὸ δόγμα ἐξῆλθε, καὶ οἱ σοφοὶ ἀπεκτείνοντο· καὶ ἐζήτησαν Δα-
¹⁴ νιὴλ καὶ τοὺς φίλους αὐτοῦ ἀνελεῖν. Τότε Δανιὴλ ἀπεκρίθη βου-
λὴν καὶ γνώμην τῷ Ἀριὼχ τῷ ἀρχιμαγείρῳ τοῦ βασιλέως, ὃς ἐ-
¹⁵ ξῆλθεν ἀνελεῖν τοὺς σοφοὺς Βαβυλῶνος· καὶ ἐπυνθάνετο αὐτοῦ,
λέγων· Ἄρχων τοῦ βασιλέως, περὶ τίνος ἐξῆλθεν ἡ γνώμη ἡ ἀναι-
δὴς αὕτη ἐκ προσώπου τοῦ βασιλέως; ἐγνώρισε δὲ τὸ ῥῆμα Ἀρι-
¹⁶ ὼχ τῷ Δανιήλ. Καὶ εἰσῆλθε Δανιὴλ, καὶ ἠξίωσεν ἀπὸ τοῦ βα-
σιλέως, ὅπως χρόνον δῷ αὐτῷ, καὶ τὴν σύγκρισιν αὐτοῦ ἀπαγ-
¹⁷ γείλῃ τῷ βασιλεῖ. Καὶ εἰσῆλθε Δανιὴλ εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ, καὶ
τῷ Ἀνανίᾳ καὶ τῷ Μισαὴλ καὶ τῷ Ἀζαρίᾳ τοῖς φίλοις αὐτοῦ τὸ
¹⁸ ῥῆμα ἐγνώρισε, καὶ οἰκτιρμοὺς ἐζήτουν παρὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ οὐ-
ρανοῦ ὑπὲρ τοῦ μυστηρίου τούτου, ὅπως μὴ ἀπόλωνται Δανιὴλ
¹⁹ καὶ οἱ φίλοι αὐτοῦ μετὰ τῶν ἐπιλοίπων σοφῶν Βαβυλῶνος. Τότε
τῷ Δανιὴλ ἐν δράματι τῆς νυκτὸς τὸ μυστήριον ἀπεκαλύφθη·
²⁰ καὶ ηὐλόγησε τὸν Θεὸν τοῦ οὐρανοῦ Δανιὴλ, καὶ εἶπεν· εἴη τὸ ὄ-
νομα τοῦ Θεοῦ εὐλογημένον ἀπὸ τοῦ αἰῶνος καὶ ἕως τοῦ αἰῶνος,
²¹ ὅτι ἡ σοφία καὶ ἡ σύνεσις καὶ ἡ ἰσχὺς αὐτοῦ ἐστὶ, καὶ αὐτὸς
ἀλλοιοῖ καιροὺς καὶ χρόνους, καθιστᾷ βασιλεῖς, καὶ μεθιστᾷ,
²² διδούς σοφίαν τοῖς σοφοῖς, καὶ φρόνησιν τοῖς εἰδόσι σύνεσιν, αὐ-
τὸς ἀποκαλύπτει βαθέα καὶ ἀπόκρυφα, γινώσκων τὰ ἐν τῷ σκό-
²³ τει, καὶ τὸ φῶς μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἐστὶ. Σοὶ δὲ ὁ Θεὸς τῶν πατέρων μου
ἐξομολογοῦμαι καὶ αἰνῶ, ὅτι σοφίαν καὶ δύναμιν δέδωκάς μοι,
καὶ νῦν ἐγνώρισάς μοι ἃ ἠξιώσαμεν παρὰ σοῦ, καὶ τὸ ὅραμα τοῦ
²⁴ βασιλέως ἐγνώρισάς μοι. Καὶ ἦλθε Δανιὴλ πρὸς Ἀριὼχ, ὃν κα-
τέστησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς ἀπολέσαι τοὺς σοφοὺς Βαβυλῶνος, καὶ εἶ-
πεν αὐτῷ· τοὺς σοφοὺς Βαβυλῶνος μὴ ἀπολέσῃς, εἰσάγαγε δέ με
ἐνώπιον τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ τὴν σύγκρισιν τῷ βασιλεῖ ἀναγγελῶ.
²⁵ Τότε Ἀριὼχ ἐν σπουδῇ εἰσήγαγε τὸν Δανιὴλ ἐνώπιον τοῦ βασι-
λέως, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· εὕρηκα ἄνδρα ἐκ τῶν υἱῶν τῆς αἰχμαλω-
σίας τῆς Ἰουδαίας, ὅστις τὸ σύγκριμα τῷ βασιλεῖ ἀναγγελεῖ.
²⁶ Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη ὁ βασιλεὺς, καὶ εἶπε τῷ Δανιὴλ, σὺ τὸ ὄνομα Βαλ-
τάσαρ· εἰ δύνασαί μοι ἀναγγεῖλαι τὸ ἐνύπνιον ὃ εἶδον, καὶ τὴν

¹¹ for the word that the king doth ask is grievous, and there is none other that can declare it before the king, save the gods, whose dwelling is not
¹² with all flesh [of man]."
Then was the king wroth and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.
¹³ And the decree went forth, and the wise men were slain; and they sought Daniel and his companions to slay them.
¹⁴ Then Daniel answered with counsel and prudence to Arioch, the captain of the king's guard, who was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon;
¹⁵ and he asked him, saying, "O captain of the king, wherefore is this fierce decree gone forth from the king's presence?" Then Arioch made known the matter unto Daniel.
¹⁶ Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he might declare the interpretation thereof unto the king.
¹⁷ Then Daniel went to his house, and made known the matter to Ananias, Misael, and Azarias, his companions;
¹⁸ and desired mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret, that Daniel and his companions might not perish with the other wise men of Babylon.
¹⁹ Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Whereupon Daniel blessed the God of heaven,
²⁰ and said, "Blessed be the Name of God from everlasting and to everlasting!
²¹ for wisdom and understanding and strength are His. He changeth the times and the seasons; He setteth up kings, and removeth kings;
²² He giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding: He revealeth the deep and secret things; He knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with Him.
²³ I thank Thee, and praise Thee, O Thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast now made known unto me that which we desired of Thee: for Thou hast made known unto me the king's vision."
²⁴ Therefore Daniel went unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him, "Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I shall declare unto the king the interpretation."
²⁵ Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, "I have found a man of the captives of Judah, who will make known unto the king the interpretation."
²⁶ The king answered and said unto Daniel, "Thou, whose name is Belteshazzar, art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the [interpretation] thereof?"
