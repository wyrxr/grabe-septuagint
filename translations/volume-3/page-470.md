τὸ ὑποκάτωθεν πηχῶν δύο, καὶ τὸ εὖρος πήχεως· καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ
ἱλαστηρίου τοῦ μικροῦ ἐπὶ τὸ ἱλαστήριον τὸ μέγα, πήχεις τέσ-
15 σαρες, καὶ εὖρος πήχεως. Καὶ τὸ ἀριὴλ πηχῶν τεσσάρων, καὶ
ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀριήλ, καὶ ὑπεράνω τῶν κεράτων πήχυς. 16 Καὶ τὸ ἀριὴλ
πηχῶν δώδεκα μήκους, ἐπὶ πήχεις δώδεκα πλάτους, τετράγω-
νον ἐπὶ τὰ τέσσαρα μέρη αὐτοῦ. 17 Καὶ τὸ ἱλαστήριον πηχῶν δε-
κατεσσάρων τὸ μῆκος, ἐπὶ πήχεις δεκατέσσαρας· τὸ εὖρος τετρά-
γωνον ἐπὶ τὰ τέσσαρα μέρη αὐτοῦ· καὶ τὸ γεῖσος αὐτῷ κυκλόθεν κυ-
κλούμενον αὐτῷ ἥμισυ πήχεως· καὶ τὸ κύκλωμα αὐτοῦ, πῆχυς
κυκλόθεν, καὶ οἱ κλιμακτῆρες αὐτοῦ, βλέποντες κατ᾽ ἀνατολάς.
18 Καὶ εἶπε πρός μέ· υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσ-
ραήλ· ταῦτα τὰ προστάγματα τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου, ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ποι-
ήσεως αὐτοῦ, τοῦ ἀναφέρειν ἐπ᾽ αὐτοῦ τὰ ὁλοκαυτώματα, καὶ
19 προσχέειν πρὸς αὐτὸ αἷμα. Καὶ δώσεις τοῖς ἱερεῦσι τοῖς Λευΐταις
τοῖς ἐκ τοῦ σπέρματος Σαδδούχ, καὶ τοῖς ἐγγίζουσι πρὸς μέ, λέ-
γει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ Λευΐ, τοῦ λειτουργεῖν μοι μόσχον ἐκ βοῶν
20 περὶ ἁμαρτίας. Καὶ λήψονται ἐκ τοῦ αἵματος αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπιθή-
σουσιν ἐπὶ τὰ τέσσαρα κέρατα τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς
τέσσαρας γωνίας τοῦ ἱλαστηρίου, καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν βάσιν κύκλῳ, καὶ
21 περιραντιεῖς αὐτὸ, καὶ ἐξιλάσονται αὐτό. Καὶ λήψονται τὸν μό-
σχον τὸν περὶ ἁμαρτίας, καὶ κατακαυθήσεται ἐν τῷ ἀποκεχωρι-
22 σμένῳ τοῦ οἴκου, ἔξωθεν τῶν ἁγίων. Καὶ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ δευτέρᾳ λήψονται ἐρίφους δύο ἀπὸ αἰγῶν ἀμώμους ὑπὲρ ἁμαρτίας,
καὶ ἐξιλάσονται τὸ θυσιαστήριον, καθὼς ἐξιλάσαντο ἐν τῷ μόσχῳ.
23 Καὶ μετὰ τὸ συντελέσαι σε τὸν ἐξιλασμὸν, προσποιήσου μόσχον
24 ἐκ βοῶν ἄμωμον, καὶ κριὸν ἐκ τῶν προβάτων ἄμωμον, καὶ προ-
σοίσετε ἐναντίον Κυρίου· καὶ ἐπιρίψουσιν οἱ ἱερεῖς ἐπ᾽ αὐτὰ ἅλας,
25 καὶ ἀνοίσουσιν αὐτὰ ὁλοκαυτώματα τῷ Κυρίῳ. Ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας
ποιήσεις ἔριφον ὑπὲρ ἁμαρτίας καθ᾽ ἡμέραν, καὶ μόσχον ἐκ βοῶν
26 καὶ κριὸν ἐκ τῶν προβάτων, ἄμωμα ποιήσουσιν ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας·
καὶ ἐξιλάσονται τὸ θυσιαστήριον, καὶ καθαρίσουσιν αὐτὸ, καὶ πλήσουσιν
27 τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν. Καὶ συντελέσουσι τὰς ἡμέρας, καὶ ἔσται ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέρας τῆς ὀγδόης καὶ ἐπέκεινα, ποιήσουσιν οἱ
ἱερεῖς ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον τὰ ὁλοκαυτώματα ὑμῶν, καὶ τὰ τοῦ
σωτηρίου ὑμῶν· καὶ προσδέξομαι ὑμᾶς, λέγει Κύριος Κύριος.

19 And thou shalt give unto the priests, the Levites, who are of the seed of Zadok, and who draw near unto Me, saith the Lord God of Levi, a bullock of the herd for a sin offering, for to minister unto Me.
20 And they shall take of its blood, and shall put it upon the four horns of the altar, and upon the four corners of the altar-hearth, and upon the base round about; and thou shalt sprinkle it, and they shall make atonement for it.
