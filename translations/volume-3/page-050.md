16 ῥυσθεῖν ἐκ τῶν μισούντων με, καὶ ἐκ τῶν βαθέων τῶν ὑδάτων. Μή
17 μὴ συσχέτω ἐπ᾿ ἐμὲ φρέαρ τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ. Εἰσάκουσόν μου Κύ-
    ριε, ὅτι χρηστὸν τὸ ἔλεός σου· κατὰ τὸ πλῆθος τῶν οἰκτιρμῶν σου
18 ἐπίβλεψον ἐπ᾿ ἐμέ. Καὶ μὴ ἀποστρέψῃς τὸ πρόσωπόν σου ἀπὸ τοῦ
19 παιδός σου· ὅτι θλίβομαι, ταχὺ ἐπάκουσόν μου. Πρόσχες τῇ ψυ-
20 χῇ μου, καὶ λύτρωσαι αὐτήν· ἕνεκα τῶν ἐχθρῶν μου ῥῦσαι με. Σὺ
    (γὰρ) γινώσκεις τὸν ὀνειδισμόν μου, καὶ τὴν αἰσχύνην μου, καὶ τὴν
21 ἐντροπὴν μου· ἐναντίον σου πάντες οἱ θλίβοντές με. Ὀνειδισμὸν
    προσεδόκησεν ἡ ψυχή μου καὶ ταλαιπωρίαν· καὶ ὑπέμεινα συλλυ-
    πούμενον, καὶ οὐχ ὑπῆρξε, καὶ παρακαλοῦντας, καὶ οὐχ εὗρον.
22 Καὶ ἔδωκαν εἰς τὸ βρῶμά μου χολὴν, καὶ εἰς τὴν δίψαν μου ἐπότι-
    σάν με ὄξος.
23 Γενηθήτω ἡ τράπεζα αὐτῶν ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν εἰς παγίδα,
    καὶ εἰς ἀνταπόδοσιν, καὶ εἰς σκάνδαλον·
24 σκοτισθήτωσαν οἱ ὀφθαλμοί αὐτῶν τοῦ μὴ βλέπειν, καὶ τὸν νῶτον αὐτῶν διαπαντὸς σύγ-
    καμψον.
25 Ἔκχεον ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς τὴν ὀργήν σου, καὶ ὁ θυμὸς τῆς ὀρ-
    γῆς σου καταλάβοι αὐτούς.
26 Γενηθήτω ἡ ἔπαυλις αὐτῶν ἐρημωμένη, καὶ ἐν τοῖς σκηνώμασιν αὐτῶν μὴ ἔστω ὁ κατοικῶν·
27 ἔτι ὃν σὺ ἐπάταξας, αὐτοὶ κατεδίωξαν, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸ ἄλγος τῶν τραυμα-
    τιῶν σου προσέθηκαν.
28 Πρόσθες ἀνομίαν ἐπὶ τὴν ἀνομίαν αὐτῶν,
    καὶ μὴ εἰσελθέτωσαν ἐν δικαιοσύνῃ σου·
29 ἐξαλειφθήτωσαν ἐκ βίβλου
    ζώντων, καὶ μετὰ δικαίων μὴ γραφήτωσαν.
30 Πτωχὸς καὶ ἀλγῶν
    εἰμι ἐγώ· (καὶ) ἡ σωτηρία (τοῦ προσώπου) σου ὁ Θεὸς ἀντιλάβοι-
    τό μου.
31 Αἰνέσω τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ Θεοῦ μου μετ᾿ ᾠδῆς, καὶ μεγαλυ-
    νῶ αὐτὸν ἐν αἰνέσει·
32 καὶ ἀρέσει τῷ Θεῷ ὑπὲρ μόσχον νέον, κέρα-
    τα ἐκφέροντα καὶ ὁπλάς.
33 Ἰδέτωσαν πτωχοὶ καὶ εὐφρανθήτωσαν·
    ἐκζητήσατε τὸν Θεὸν, καὶ ζήσεται ἡ ψυχὴ ὑμῶν.
34 Ὅτι εἰσήκουσε
    τῶν πενήτων ὁ Κύριος, καὶ τοὺς πεπεδημένους αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἐξουδέ-
    νωσεν.
35 Αἰνεσάτωσαν αὐτὸν οἱ οὐρανοὶ καὶ ἡ γῆ, θάλασσα καὶ πάν-
    τα τὰ ἕρποντα ἐν αὐτοῖς.
36 Ὅτι ὁ Θεὸς σώσει τὴν Σιὼν, καὶ οἰ-
    κοδομηθήσονται αἱ πόλεις τῆς Ἰουδαίας, καὶ κατοικήσουσιν ἐκεῖ,
37 καὶ κληρονομήσουσιν αὐτήν· καὶ τὸ σπέρμα τῶν δούλων αὐτοῦ καθ-
    έξουσιν αὐτὴν, καὶ οἱ ἀγαπῶντες τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ κατασκηνώσου-
    σιν ἐν αὐτῇ.

**PSALM LXVIII. [Continued]**

16 To be delivered from them that hate me, and from the deep waters.
17 Let not the pit shut its mouth over me.
Hear me, O Lord, for Thy mercy is good;
According to the multitude of Thy compassions, look Thou upon me.
18 And turn not Thy face from Thy servant;
19 For I am afflicted, quickly hear me.
Give heed unto my soul,
20 And redeem it; for the sake of mine enemies, deliver me.
For Thou knowest my reproach, and my shame, and my ignominy;
21 Before Thee are all they that afflict me.
Reproach and misery hath my soul awaited;
And I looked for one to grieve with me, but there was none;
And for comforters, but I found none.
22 They gave me also gall for my meat;
And in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
23 Let their table before them become unto a snare,
And unto a recompense, and unto a stumbling-block.
24 Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see;
And bow Thou down their back continually.
25 Pour out Thine indignation upon them, and let the fierceness of Thy wrath take hold of them.
26 Let their habitation be made desolate, and let there be none to dwell in their tents.
27 For him whom Thou hast smitten, they have persecuted;
And to the pain of Thy wounded ones have they added.
28 Add iniquity unto their iniquity, and let them not enter into Thy righteousness.
29 Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and let them not be written with the righteous.
30 But I am poor and grieved;
And the salvation of Thy countenance, O God, uphold me.
31 I will praise the name of my God with a song, and I will magnify Him with thanksgiving.
32 And this shall please God better than a young bullock that hath horns and hoofs.
33 The poor shall see, and be glad;
Seek ye God, and your soul shall live.
34 For the Lord hath heard the needy, and hath not despised His prisoners.
35 Let the heavens and the earth praise Him, the sea and all that creepeth therein.
36 For God shall save Zion, and the cities of Judah shall be built; and they shall dwell there,
37 And shall inherit it; and the seed of His servants shall possess it, and they that love His Name shall abide therein.
