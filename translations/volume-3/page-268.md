**6** Καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν τειχέων σου Ἱερουσαλὴμ κατέστησα φύλακας ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν καὶ ὅλην τὴν νύκτα, οἳ διὰ τέλους οὐ σιωπήσονται μιμνησκόμενοι Κυρίου. **7** Οὐκ ἔστι γὰρ ὑμῖν ὅμοιος· ἐὰν διορθώσῃ, καὶ ποιήσῃ Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἀγαυρίαμα ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς. **8** Ὤμοσε Κύριος κατὰ τῆς δεξιᾶς αὐτοῦ, καὶ κατὰ τῆς ἰσχύος τοῦ βραχίονος αὐτοῦ, εἰ ἔτι δώσω τὸν σῖτόν σου, καὶ τὰ βρώματά σου τοῖς ἐχθροῖς σου, καὶ εἰ ἔτι πίονται υἱοὶ ἀλλότριοι τὸν οἶνόν σου, ἐφ᾿ ᾧ ἐμόχθησας, **9** ἀλλ’ ἢ οἱ συνάγοντες φάγονται αὐτά, καὶ αἰνέσουσι Κύριον, καὶ οἱ συνάγοντες πίονται αὐτὰ ἐν ταῖς ἐπαύλεσι ταῖς ἁγίαις μου. **10** Πορεύεσθε, περιέλθετε διὰ τῶν πυλῶν μου, καὶ ὁδοποιήσατε τῷ λαῷ μου· σκευάσατε τὴν ὁδόν, καὶ ὁδοποιήσατε, καὶ τοὺς λίθους τοὺς ἐκ τῆς ὁδοῦ διαῤῥίψατε· ἐξάρατε σύσσημον εἰς τὰ ἔθνη. **11** Ἰδοὺ γὰρ Κύριος ἐποίησεν ἀκουστὸν ἕως ἐσχάτου τῆς γῆς· εἴπατε τῇ θυγατρὶ Σιὼν, ἰδοὺ σοὶ ὁ σωτὴρ παραγίνεται ἔχων τὸν ἑαυτοῦ μισθὸν μετ’ αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὸ ἔργον αὐτοῦ πρὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ. **12** Καὶ καλέσει αὐτὸν λαὸν ἅγιον, λελυτρωμένον ὑπὸ Κυρίου, σὺ δὲ κληθήσῃ ἐπιζητουμένη πόλις, καὶ οὐκ ἐγκαταλελειμμένη.

**1** ΤΙΣ οὗτος ὁ παραγινόμενος ἐξ Ἐδώμ ; ἐρύθημα ἱματίων ἐκ Βοσόρ; οὗτος ὡραῖος ἐν στολῇ αὐτοῦ, βίᾳ μετὰ ἰσχύος ; ἐγὼ διαλέγομαι δικαιοσύνην καὶ κρίσιν σωτηρίου. **2** Διατί σου ἐρυθρὰ τὰ ἱμάτια, καὶ τὰ ἐνδύματά σου ὡς ἀπὸ πατητοῦ ληνοῦ; **3** Πλήρης καταπεπατημένης, καὶ τῶν ἐθνῶν οὐκ ἔστιν ἀνὴρ μετ’ ἐμοῦ; καὶ κατεπάτησα αὐτοὺς ἐν θυμῷ μου, καὶ κατέθλασα αὐτούς, ἐν ὀργῇ μου, καὶ κατήγαγον τὸ αἷμα αὐτῶν εἰς γῆν, καὶ πάντα τὰ ἐνδύματά μου ἐμόλυνα. **4** Ἡμέρα γὰρ ἀνταποδόσεως ἐπῆλθεν αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἐνιαυτὸς λυτρώσεως πάρεστι. **5** Καὶ ἐπέβλεψα, καὶ οὐδεὶς βοηθός· καὶ προσενοήσα, καὶ οὐδεὶς ἀντελαμβάνετο· καὶ ἐῤῥύσατο αὐτοὺς ὁ βραχίων μου, καὶ ὁ θυμός μου ἐπέστη. **6** Καὶ κατεπάτησα αὐτοὺς τῇ ὀργῇ μου, καὶ ἐμέθυσα αὐτοὺς ἐν θυμῷ μου, καὶ κατήγαγον τὸ αἷμα αὐτῶν εἰς γῆν. **7** Τὸν

#### Chapter 62

**6** And upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, have I set watchmen,
    all the day and all the night;
    who shall never hold their peace,
    making mention of the Lord.
**7** For there is none like unto you [watchmen];
    and if thou [O Jerusalem] shouldst amend [thy ways],
    and make Jerusalem a glory upon the earth.
**8** The Lord hath sworn by His right hand,
    and by the might of His arm:
    "Surely I will no more give thy corn,
    and thy food unto thine enemies;
    nor shall alien sons any more drink thy wine,
    for which thou hast labored;
**9** But rather they that gather them shall eat them,
    and shall praise the Lord;
    and they that gather them shall drink them
    in My holy courts."
**10** Go ye forth, pass through My gates,
    and prepare ye the way for My people;
    make ready the road, and make it plain;
    and cast ye forth the stones from the way;
    lift up a standard for the nations.
**11** For behold, the Lord hath made it heard
    unto the uttermost part of the earth:
    "Say ye to the daughter of Zion,
    Behold, thy Savior cometh,
    having His reward with Him,
    and His work before His face."
**12** And He shall call them a holy people,
    redeemed by the Lord;
    and thou shalt be called A City Sought Out,
    and not Forsaken.

#### Chapter 63

**1** Who is this that cometh from Edom?
    [with] garments dyed crimson from Bozrah?
    This One, beautiful in His array,
    [marching] with might and with strength?
    "I speak righteousness and the judgment of salvation."
**2** "Wherefore are Thy garments red,
    and Thine apparel as from a winepress trodden?"
**3** "Full is the trodden [winepress],
    and of the nations there is no man with Me.
    And I have trodden them in My wrath,
    and I have crushed them in My fury;
    and I brought down their blood to the earth,
    and I have defiled all My garments.
**4** For the day of recompense is come upon them,
    and the year of redemption is present.
**5** And I looked, and there was none to help;
    and I gave heed, and there was none to uphold;
    and My arm saved them,
    and My wrath stood by [Me].
**6** And I trod them down in My fury,
    and I made them drunk in My wrath,
    and I brought down their blood to the earth.
**7** The
