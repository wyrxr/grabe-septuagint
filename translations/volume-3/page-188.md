αἱ ἐργασίαι αὐτῶν ὡς σπινθῆρες πυρός, καὶ κατακαυθήσονται οἱ
ἄνομοι καὶ οἱ ἁμαρτωλοὶ ἅμα, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ὁ σβέσων.

**ΚΕΦ. Β'. ΙΙ.**

**1** Ὁ λόγος ὁ γενόμενος παρὰ Κυρίου πρὸς Ἡσαίαν υἱὸν Ἀμὼς
**2** περὶ τῆς Ἰουδαίας, καὶ περὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ. Ὅτι ἔσται ἐν ταῖς
  ἐσχάταις ἡμέραις ἐμφανὲς τὸ ὄρος τοῦ Κυρίου, καὶ ὁ οἶκος τοῦ
  Θεοῦ, ἐπ᾿ ἄκρου τῶν ὀρέων, καὶ ὑψωθήσεται ὑπεράνω τῶν βουνῶν·
**3** καὶ ἥξουσιν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη, καὶ πορεύσονται ἔθνη
  πολλὰ, καὶ ἐροῦσι· δεῦτε, καὶ ἀναβῶμεν εἰς τὸ ὄρος τοῦ Κυρίου,
  καὶ εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Θεοῦ Ἰακώβ, καὶ ἀναγγελεῖ ἡμῖν τὴν ὁδὸν
  αὐτοῦ, καὶ πορευσόμεθα ἐν αὐτῇ. Ἐκ γὰρ Σιὼν ἐξελεύσεται νόμος,
**4** καὶ λόγος Κυρίου ἐξ Ἱερουσαλήμ· καὶ κρινεῖ ἀναμέσον τῶν
  ἐθνῶν, καὶ ἐξελέγξει λαὸν πολύν· καὶ συγκόψουσι τὰς μαχαίρας
  αὐτῶν εἰς ἄροτρα, καὶ τὰς ζιβύνας αὐτῶν εἰς δρέπανα, καὶ οὐ λήψεται
  ἔτι ἔθνος ἐπ᾿ ἔθνος μάχαιραν, καὶ οὐ μὴ μάθωσιν ἔτι πολεμεῖν.
**5** Καὶ νῦν ὁ οἶκος τοῦ Ἰακώβ, δεῦτε, πορευθῶμεν τῷ φωτὶ
**6** Κυρίου· ἀνῆκε γὰρ τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Ἰσραήλ· ὅτι ἐνεπλήσθη
  ὡς τὸ ἀπ᾿ ἀρχῆς ἡ χώρα αὐτῶν κληδονισμῶν, ὡς ἡ τῶν
  ἀλλοφύλων, καὶ τέκνα πολλὰ ἀλλόφυλα ἐγενήθη αὐτοῖς.
**7** Ἐνεπλήσθη γὰρ ἡ χώρα αὐτῶν ἀργυρίου καὶ χρυσίου, καὶ οὐκ ἦν
  ἀριθμὸς τῶν θησαυρῶν αὐτῶν· καὶ ἐνεπλήσθη ἡ γῆ αὐτῶν, ἵππων,
  καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἀριθμὸς τῶν ἁρμάτων αὐτῶν·
**8** καὶ ἐνεπλήσθη ἡ γῆ βδελυγμάτων τῶν ἔργων τῶν χειρῶν
  αὐτῶν, καὶ προσεκύνησαν οἷς ἐποίησαν οἱ δάκτυλοι αὐτῶν·
**9** καὶ ἔκυψεν ἄνθρωπος, καὶ ἐταπεινώθη ἀνήρ, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἀνήσω
  αὐτοῦς.
**10** Καὶ νῦν εἰσέλθατε εἰς τὰς πέτρας, καὶ κρύπτεσθε εἰς τὴν γῆν
  ἀπὸ προσώπου τοῦ φόβου Κυρίου, καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς δόξης τῆς ἰσχύος
  αὐτοῦ, ὅταν ἀναστῇ θραῦσαι τὴν γῆν.
**11** Οἱ γὰρ ὀφθαλμοὶ Κυρίου ὑψηλοί, ὁ δὲ ἄνθρωπος ταπεινός· καὶ
  ταπεινωθήσεται τὸ ὕψος τῶν ἀνθρώπων, καὶ ὑψωθήσεται Κύριος
  μόνος ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ.
**12** Ἡμέρα γὰρ Κυρίου Σαβαὼθ ἐπὶ πάντα ὑβριστὴν καὶ ὑπερήφανον,
  καὶ ἐπὶ πάντα ὑψηλὸν καὶ μετέωρον, καὶ ταπεινωθήσονται,
**13** καὶ ἐπὶ πᾶσαν κέδρον τοῦ Λιβάνου τῶν ὑψηλῶν καὶ μετεώρων,
  καὶ ἐπὶ πᾶν δένδρον βάλανο, Βασᾶν,
**14** καὶ ἐπὶ πᾶν ὑψηλὸν ὄρος, καὶ ἐπὶ πάντα βουνὸν ὑψηλὸν,

...and their deeds as sparks of fire,
And the lawless and the sinners shall be burned up together,
And there shall be none to quench [them].

### CHAPTER 2

**1** The word which came unto Isaiah the son of Amoz,
Concerning Judah and concerning Jerusalem.
**2** For it shall come to pass in the last days,
That the mountain of the Lord shall be made manifest,
And the house of God, upon the top of the mountains,
And it shall be exalted above the hills.
**3** And all the nations shall come unto it,
And many peoples shall go forth,
And they shall say: "Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord,
And to the house of the God of Jacob;
And He will declare unto us His way,
And we shall walk therein."
For from Zion shall go forth the Law,
And the Word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
**4** And He shall judge among the nations,
And shall rebuke many peoples;
And they shall beat their swords into ploughshares,
And their spears into pruning hooks;
Nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
Neither shall they learn war any more.
**5** And now, O house of Jacob, come ye,
Let us walk in the light of the Lord.

**6** For He hath forsaken His people, the house of Israel;
Because their land was filled, as from the beginning, with divinations,
Like unto that of the foreigners,
And many foreign children were born unto them.
**7** For their land was filled with silver and with gold,
And there was no number to their treasures;
And their land was filled with horses,
And there was no number to their chariots.
**8** And their land was filled with the abominations
Of the works of their hands,
And they worshipped that which their fingers made.
**9** And man bowed down, and man was humbled,
And I will not forgive them.

**10** And now, enter ye into the rocks,
And hide yourselves in the earth
From the face of the fear of the Lord,
And from the glory of His might,
When He shall arise to shatter the earth.
**11** For the eyes of the Lord are high,
But man is lowly;
And the loftiness of men shall be humbled,
And the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.
**12** For the day of the Lord of Sabaoth [shall come]
Upon every insolent and proud one,
And upon every high and lifted up one;
And they shall be humbled.
**13** And upon every cedar of Lebanon, the high and the lofty,
And upon every oak tree of Bashan;
**14** And upon every high mountain,
And upon every lofty hill,
