ΚΕΦ. Θʹ.
7 Μεγάλη ἡ ἀρχὴ αὐτοῦ, καὶ τῆς εἰρήνης αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἔστιν ὅριον
ἐπὶ τὸν θρόνον Δαυίδ, καὶ τὴν βασιλείαν αὐτοῦ, κατορθῶσαι
αὐτήν, καὶ ἀντιλαβέσθαι αὐτῆς ἐν κρίματι καὶ ἐν δικαιοσύνῃ,
ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν καὶ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα χρόνον· ὁ ζῆλος Κυρίου Σα-
8 βαὼθ ποιήσει ταῦτα. Θάνατον ἀπέστειλε Κύριος ἐπὶ Ἰακώβ,
9 καὶ ἦλθεν ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ· καὶ γνώσονται πᾶς ὁ λαὸς τοῦ Ἐφραὶμ
καὶ οἱ ἐγκαθήμενοι ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ ἐφ᾽ ὕβρει καὶ ὑψηλῇ καρδίᾳ,
10 λέγοντες· πλίνθοι πεπτώκασιν, ἀλλὰ δεῦτε λαξεύσωμεν λίθους,
καὶ ἐκκόψωμεν συκαμίνους καὶ κέδρους, καὶ οἰκοδομήσωμεν ἐ-
11 αυτοῖς πύργον. Καὶ ῥάξει ὁ Θεὸς τοὺς ἐπανισταμένους ἐπ᾽ ὄρους
12 Σιὼν ἐπ᾽ αὐτόν, καὶ τοὺς ἐχθροὺς αὐτοῦ διασκεδάσει· Συρίαν ἀφ᾽
ἡλίου ἀνατολῶν, καὶ τοὺς Ἕλληνας ἀφ᾽ ἡλίου δυσμῶν, τοὺς κα-
τεσθίοντας τὸν Ἰσραὴλ ὅλῳ τῷ στόματι. Ἐπὶ τούτοις πᾶσιν οὐκ
13 ἀπεστράφη ὁ θυμὸς αὐτοῦ, ἀλλ᾽ ἔτι ἡ χεὶρ αὐτοῦ ὑψηλή. Καὶ ὁ
λαὸς οὐκ ἀπεστράφη, ἕως ἐπλήγη, καὶ τὸν Κύριον οὐκ ἐξεζήτη-
14 σαν. Καὶ ἀφεῖλε Κύριος ἀπὸ Ἰσραὴλ κεφαλὴν καὶ οὐράν, μέγαν,
καὶ μικρόν, ἐν μιᾷ ἡμέρᾳ· πρεσβύτην, καὶ τοὺς τὰ πρόσωπα θαυ-
15 μάζοντας, αὕτη ἡ ἀρχή· καὶ προφήτην διδάσκοντα ἄνομα, οὗτος
16 ἡ οὐρά· καὶ ἔσονται οἱ μακαρίζοντες τὸν λαὸν τοῦτον πλανῶντες,
17 καὶ πλανῶσιν, ὅπως καταπίωσιν αὐτούς. Διὰ τοῦτο ἐπὶ τοὺς νε-
ανίσκους αὐτῶν οὐκ εὐφρανθήσεται ὁ Κύριος, καὶ τοὺς ὀρφανοὺς
αὐτῶν καὶ τὰς χήρας αὐτῶν οὐκ ἐλεήσει· ὅτι πάντες ἄνομοι καὶ
πονηροί, καὶ πᾶν στόμα λαλεῖ ἄδικα. Ἐπὶ πᾶσι τούτοις οὐκ ἀ-
18 πεστράφη ὁ θυμός, ἀλλ᾽ ἔτι ἡ χεὶρ ὑψηλή. Καὶ καυθήσεται ὡς
πῦρ ἡ ἀνομία, καὶ ὡς ἄγρωστις ξηρὰ βρωθήσεται ὑπὸ πυρός· καὶ
καυθήσεται ἐν τοῖς δάσεσι τοῦ δρυμοῦ, καὶ συγκαταφάγεται
τὰ κύκλῳ τῶν βουνῶν πάντα· διὰ θυμὸν ὀργῆς Κυρίου Σα-
19 βαὼθ συγκέκαυται ἡ γῆ ὅλη, καὶ ἔσται ὁ λαὸς ὡς ὑπὸ πυρὸς
20 κατακεκαυμένος. Ἄνθρωπος τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἐλεήσει, ἀλλὰ
ἐκκλινεῖ εἰς τὰ δεξιά, ὅτι πεινάσει, καὶ φάγεται ἐκ τῶν ἀριστερῶν,
καὶ οὐ μὴ ἐμπλησθῇ ἄνθρωπος ἔσθων τὰς σάρκας τοῦ βραχίονος
21 τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ· φάγεται γὰρ Μαννασσῆς τοῦ Ἐφραΐμ, καὶ
Ἐφραὶμ τοῦ Μαννασσῆ, ὅτι ἅμα πολιορκήσουσι τὸν Ἰούδαν. Ἐπὶ
τούτοις πᾶσιν οὐκ ἀπεστράφη ὁ θυμὸς αὐτοῦ· ἀλλ᾽ ἔτι ἡ χεὶρ ὑψηλή.

### 2. A free and highly literary translation

**7** Great shall be His dominion, and of His peace there shall be no end. Upon the throne of David and upon His kingdom, to order it and to establish it in judgment and in righteousness, from this time forth and even for evermore. The zeal of the Lord of Hosts shall perform this.

**8** The Lord sent forth death upon Jacob, and it came upon Israel.
**9** And all the people of Ephraim and they that dwell in Samaria shall know it, [even they] who in arrogance and with haughty heart declare,
**10** "The bricks are fallen, but come, let us hew stones; and let us cut down sycamore trees and cedars, and build for ourselves a tower."
**11** And God shall stir up against them those that rise against Mount Zion, and He shall scatter His enemies:
**12** Syria from the rising of the sun, and the Greeks from the setting of the sun, even those that devour Israel with their whole mouth. For all these things, His wrath hath not turned away, but His hand is yet lifted high.
**13** Yet the people turned not, even when they were smitten; and they sought not the Lord.
**14** Therefore the Lord shall cut off from Israel head and tail, the great and the small, in one day.
**15** The elder, and them that show partiality, these are the head. And the prophet that teacheth lawlessness, this is the tail.
**16** And they that call this people blessed shall be deceivers; yea, they shall lead them astray, that they may utterly consume them.
**17** For this cause the Lord shall not rejoice over their young men, neither shall He have mercy on their orphans nor their widows. For all of them are lawless and wicked, and every mouth speaketh unrighteousness. For all these things, His wrath hath not turned away, but His hand is yet lifted high.
**18** And lawlessness shall burn as a fire, and as dry stubble shall it be consumed by fire. And it shall burn in the thickets of the forest, and shall utterly devour all that is round about the mountains. Through the fury of the wrath of the Lord of Hosts, the whole land hath been burned, and the people shall be as men consumed by fire.
**19** And no man shall pity his brother; but one shall turn to the right, because he shall hunger,
**20** And he shall eat from the left, yet shall no man be satisfied, even eating the flesh of his brother's arm.
**21** For Manasseh shall devour Ephraim, and Ephraim Manasseh, because together they shall besiege Judah. For all these things, His wrath hath not turned away, but His hand is yet lifted high.
