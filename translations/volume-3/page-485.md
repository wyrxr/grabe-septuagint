ποιεῖτε θυγάτρασιν ᾿Ισραήλ, κἀκεῖναι φοβούμεναι ὡμίλουν ὑμῖν·
ἀλλ᾽ οὐ θυγάτηρ ᾿Ιούδα ὑπέμεινε τὴν ἀνομίαν ὑμῶν. Νῦν οὖν λέγε 58

Θεῷ τῷ σῴζοντι τοὺς ἐλπίζοντας ἐπ᾽ αὐτόν. Καὶ ἀνέστησαν ἐπὶ 61
τοὺς δύο πρεσβυτέρους, ὅτι συνέστησαν αὐτοὺς Δανιὴλ ἐκ τοῦ
στόματος αὐτῶν ψευδομαρτυρήσαντας, καὶ ἐποίησαν αὐτοῖς ὃν
τρόπον ἐπονηρεύσαντο τῷ πλησίον, ποιῆσαι κατὰ τὸν νόμον Μωσῆ, 62
καὶ ἀπέκτειναν αὐτούς, καὶ ἐσώθη αἷμα ἀναίτιον ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ
ἐκείνῃ. Χελκίας δὲ καὶ ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ ᾔνεσαν τὸν Θεὸν περὶ τῆς 63
θυγατρὸς αὐτῶν Σουσάννας μετὰ ᾿Ιωακεὶμ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς αὐτῆς
καὶ τῶν συγγενῶν πάντων, ὅτι οὐχ εὑρέθη ἐν αὐτῇ ἄσχημον
πρᾶγμα. Καὶ Δανιήλ ἐγένετο μέγας ἐνώπιον τοῦ λαοῦ ἀπὸ τῆς 64
