**ΨΑΛΜ. Μς'. XLVI. (continued)**
8 Θεός. Ψάλατε συνετῶς.
9 Ἐβασίλευσεν ὁ Θεὸς ἐπὶ (πάντα) τὰ ἔθνη· ὁ Θεὸς κάθηται ἐπὶ θρόνου ἁγίου αὐτοῦ.
10 Ἄρχοντες λαῶν συνήχθησαν μετὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ Ἀβραάμ· ὅτι τοῦ Θεοῦ οἱ κραταιοὶ τῆς γῆς σφόδρα ἐπήρθησαν.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ΜΖ΄. XLVII.**
1 (Εἰς τὸ τέλος) Ψαλμὸς ᾠδῆς τοῖς υἱοῖς Κορέ (τῷ Δαυΐδ).
2 Μέγας Κύριος καὶ αἰνετὸς σφόδρα, ἐν πόλει τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν, ἐν
3 ὄρει ἁγίῳ αὐτοῦ, εὐρίζῳ, ἀγαλλιάματι πάσῃ τῇ γῇ. Ὄρη Σιὼν
4 τὰ πλευρὰ τοῦ βορρᾶ· ἡ πόλις τοῦ βασιλέως τοῦ μεγάλου. Ὁ
   Θεὸς ἐν ταῖς βάρεσιν αὐτοῖς γινώσκεται, ὅταν ἀντιλαμβάνηται
5 αὐτῆς. Ὅτι ἰδοὺ οἱ βασιλεῖς (τῆς γῆς) συνήχθησαν, διῆλθον
6 ἐπιτοαυτό· αὐτοὶ ἰδόντες οὕτως, ἐθαύμασαν· ἐταράχθησαν, ἐσα-
7 λεύθησαν· τρόμος ἐπελάβετο αὐτῶν· ἐκεῖ ὠδῖνες ὡς τικτούσης.
8 Ἐν πνεύματι βιαίῳ συντρίψεις πλοῖα Θαρσεῖς.
9 Καθάπερ ἠκούσαμεν, οὕτως εἴδομεν ἐν πόλει Κυρίου τῶν δυνάμεων, ἐν πόλει τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν· ὁ Θεὸς ἐθεμελίωσεν αὐτὴν εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα. Διάψαλμα.
10 Ὑπελάβομεν, ὁ Θεὸς, τὸ ἔλεός σου ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ ναοῦ σου.
11 Κατὰ τὸ ὄνομά σου, ὁ Θεὸς, οὕτως καὶ ἡ αἴνεσίς σου ἐπὶ τὰ πέρα-
12 τα τῆς γῆς· δικαιοσύνης πλήρης ἡ δεξιά σου. Εὐφρανθήτω τὸ
   ὄρος Σιὼν, καὶ ἀγαλλιάσθωσαν αἱ θυγατέρες τῆς Ἰουδαίας, ἕνε-
13 κεν τῶν κριμάτων σου Κύριε. Κυκλώσατε Σιὼν καὶ περιλάβετε
14 αὐτὴν, διηγήσασθε ἐν τοῖς πύργοις αὐτῆς· θέσθε τὰς καρδίας ὑμῶν
   εἰς τὴν δύναμιν αὐτῆς, καὶ καταδιέλεσθε τὰς βάρεῖς αὐτῆς. ὅπως
15 ἂν διηγήσησθε εἰς γενεὰν ἑτέραν. Ὅτι οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ Θεὸς ὁ Θεὸς
   ἡμῶν εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, καὶ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τοῦ αἰῶνος· αὐτὸς ποι-
   μανεῖ ἡμᾶς εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ΜΗ΄. XLVIII.**
1 (Εἰς τὸ τέλος) τοῖς υἱοῖς Κορέ Ψαλμὸς (τῷ Δαυΐδ).
2 Ἀκούσατε ταῦτα πάντα τὰ ἔθνη, ἐνωτίσασθε πάντες οἱ κατοικοῦντες τὴν οἰκουμένην·
3 οἵ τε γηγενεῖς καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ τῶν ἀνθρώπων, ἐπιτοαυτὸ
4 πλούσιος καὶ πένης. Τὸ στόμα μου λαλήσει σοφίαν, καὶ ἡ μελέτη τῆς
5 καρδίας μου σύνεσιν· Κλινῶ εἰς παραβολὴν τὸ οὖς μου, ἀνοίξω ἐν

**PSALM XLVI. (continued)**

8 God. Sing ye praises with understanding.
9 God hath reigned over [all] the nations;
God sitteth upon His holy throne.
10 The princes of the peoples were gathered together
with the God of Abraham;
For unto God belong the mighty ones of the earth;
They are greatly exalted.

**PSALM XLVII.**

Unto the End, A Psalm of a Song for the sons of Korah (of David).

2 Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised
In the city of our God, in His holy mount,
3 Well-rooted, a rejoicing to all the earth.
The mountains of Zion, the sides of the North,
4 The city of the great King.
God is known within her fortresses, [and reveals Himself] to them,
when He defendeth her.
5 For lo, the kings [of the earth] were gathered,
They passed by together.
6 They themselves, having thus seen, were astonished;
They were troubled, they were shaken.
7 Trembling seized them;
There were pangs as of a woman in travail.
8 With a violent wind shalt Thou shatter the ships of Tarshish.
9 As we have heard, so have we seen
In the city of the Lord of Hosts,
In the city of our God;
God hath established her for ever. Selah.
10 We have received, O God, Thy mercy
In the midst of Thy temple.
11 According to Thy Name, O God,
So also is Thy praise unto the ends of the earth;
Thy right hand is full of righteousness.
12 Let Mount Zion rejoice,
And let the daughters of Judea be glad,
Because of Thy judgments, O Lord.
13 Go round about Zion and encompass her;
Tell ye in her towers.
14 Set your hearts upon her strength,
And thoroughly examine her fortresses,
15 So that ye may recount [it] to another generation.
For this is God, even our God, for ever,
And unto the age of ages;
He Himself shall shepherd us unto the ages.

**PSALM XLVIII.**

Unto the End, for the sons of Korah, a Psalm (of David).

2 Hear these things, all ye nations;
Give ear, all ye that inhabit the world:
3 Both the earth-born and the sons of men, together,
4 The rich and the poor alike.
My mouth shall speak wisdom,
And the meditation of my heart shall speak understanding.
5 I will incline my ear to a parable;
I will open my riddle upon the harp.
