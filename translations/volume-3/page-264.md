**5.** κύουσι πόνον, καὶ τίκτουσιν ἀνομίαν. Ὡς ἀσπίδων ἐῤῥηξαν, καὶ
**6.** ἱστὸν ἀράχνης ὑφαίνουσι, καὶ ὁ μέλλων τῶν ὠῶν αὐτῶν φαγεῖν, συντρίψας οὔριον, εὗρε καὶ ἐν αὐτῷ βασιλίσκον. Ὁ ἱστὸς αὐτῶν οὐκ ἔσται εἰς ἱμάτιον, οὐδὲ μὴ περιβάλλωνται ἀπὸ τῶν ἔργων
**7.** αὐτῶν· τὰ γὰρ ἔργα αὐτῶν, ἔργα ἀνομίας, καὶ ἔργον ἀδικίας ἐν χερσὶν αὐτῶν. Οἱ δὲ πόδες αὐτῶν ἐπὶ πονηρίαν τρέχουσι, ταχινοὶ ἐγχέαι αἷμα ἀναίτιον, καὶ οἱ διαλογισμοὶ αὐτῶν, διαλογισμοὶ ἀφρόνων· σύντριμμα καὶ ταλαιπωρία ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὐτῶν,
**8.** καὶ ὁδὸν εἰρήνης οὐκ ἔγνωσαν, καὶ οὐκ ἔστι κρίσις ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὐτῶν· αἱ γὰρ τρίβοι αὐτῶν διεστραμμέναι, ἃς διοδεύουσι, καὶ
**9.** οὐκ οἴδασιν εἰρήνην. Διὰ τοῦτο ἀπέστη ἡ κρίσις ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν, καὶ οὐ μὴ καταλάβῃ αὐτοὺς δικαιοσύνη· ὑπομεινάντων αὐτῶν φῶς ἐγένετο αὐτοῖς σκότος, μείναντες αὐγὴν ἐν ἀωρίᾳ περιεπάτησαν.
**10.** Ψηλαφήσουσιν ὡς τυφλοὶ τοῖχον, καὶ ὡς οὐχ ὑπαρχόντων ὀφθαλμῶν ψηλαφήσουσι, καὶ πεσοῦνται ἐν μεσημβρίᾳ ὡς ἐν μεσονυκτίῳ,
**11.** ὡς ἀποθνήσκοντες στενάζουσιν, ὡς ἄρχος καὶ ὡς περιστερὰ ἅμα πορεύσονται· ἀνεμείναμεν κρίσιν, καὶ οὐκ ἔστι σωτηρία, μακρὰν ἀφέστηκεν ἀφ᾿ ἡμῶν.
**12.** Πολλὴ γὰρ ἡμῶν ἡ ἀνομία ἐναντίον σου, καὶ αἱ ἁμαρτίαι ἡμῶν ἀντέστησαν ἡμῖν· αἱ γὰρ ἀνομίαι ἡμῶν ἐν ἡμῖν, καὶ τὰ ἀδικήματα ἡμῶν ἔγνωμεν,
**13.** ἠσεβήσαμεν καὶ ἐψευσάμεθα ἐν Κυρίῳ, καὶ ἀπέστημεν ἀπὸ ὄπισθεν τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν· ἐλαλήσαμεν ἄδικα, καὶ ἠπειθήσαμεν· ἐκύομεν, καὶ ἐμελετήσαμεν ἀπὸ καρδίας ἡμῶν λόγους ἀδίκους,
**14.** καὶ ἀπεστήσαμεν ὀπίσω τὴν κρίσιν, καὶ ἡ δικαιοσύνη μακρὰν ἀφέστηκεν ἀφ᾿ ἡμῶν· ὅτι κατηναλώθη ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὐτῶν ἡ ἀλήθεια, καὶ δι᾿ εὐθείας οὐκ ἠδύναντο διελθεῖν.
**15.** Καὶ ἡ ἀλήθεια ἦρται, καὶ μετέστησαν τὴν διάνοιαν αὐτῶν τοῦ συνιέναι· καὶ εἶδε Κύριος, καὶ οὐκ ἤρεσεν αὐτῷ, ὅτι οὐκ ἦν κρίσις.
**16.** Καὶ ἴδε, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἀνήρ, καὶ κατενόησε, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ ἀντιληψόμενος, καὶ ἠμύνατο αὐτοὺς τῷ βραχίονι αὐτοῦ, καὶ τῇ ἐλεημοσύνῃ αὐτοῦ ἐστηρίσατο.
**17.** Καὶ ἐνεδύσατο δικαιοσύνην ὡς θώρακα, καὶ περιέθετο περικεφαλαίαν σωτηρίου ἐπὶ τῆς κεφαλῆς, καὶ περιεβάλετο ἱμάτιον ἐκδικήσεως καὶ τὸ περιβόλαιον ζήλου·
**18.** ὡς ἀνταποδώσων ἀνταπόδοσιν ὄνειδος τοῖς ὑπεναντίοις αὐτοῦ, ἄμυναν τοῖς ἐχθροῖς αὐτοῦ, ταῖς νήσοις ἀνταπόδομα ἀνταποδώσει.
**19.** Καὶ φοβηθήσονται οἱ ἀπὸ δυσμῶν τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου, καὶ οἱ ἀπὸ

#### Chapter 59

**5** They conceive trouble, and bring forth iniquity.
    As asps' [eggs] have they hatched,
**6** and a spider's web do they weave.
    And he who would eat of their eggs,
    having crushed [even] a wind-egg,
    found even in it a basilisk.
    Their web shall not be for a garment,
    neither shall they clothe themselves with their works;
**7** for their works are works of lawlessness,
    and the work of injustice is in their hands.
    But their feet run to evil,
    swift to shed innocent blood;
    and their thoughts are the thoughts of fools.
    Destruction and misery are in their ways,
**8** and the way of peace have they not known;
    neither is there judgment in their ways.
    For their paths are crooked,
    wherein they walk, and they know not peace.
**9** Therefore hath judgment departed from them,
    and righteousness shall not overtake them.
    Though they waited for light, it became darkness for them;
    remaining [in expectation of] brightness, they walked in gloom.
**10** They shall grope as blind men a wall,
    and as those having no eyes shall they grope;
    and they shall stumble at noonday as in midnight.
**11** They groan as those dying;
    as bears and as doves together shall they wander [in sorrow].
    We have waited for judgment, and there is no salvation;
    it hath departed far from us.
**12** For great is our lawlessness before Thee,
    and our sins have risen up against us;
    for our lawless deeds are within us,
    and our unrighteous acts have we known.
**13** We have been impious and have lied before the Lord;
    and we have turned back from behind our God.
    We have spoken unrighteous things, and have been disobedient;
    we conceived and meditated from our heart unrighteous words.
**14** And we have turned back judgment behind us,
    and righteousness hath departed far from us;
    because truth hath been consumed in their ways,
    and through a straight path could they not pass.
**15** And truth hath been taken away,
    and they have changed their mind from understanding.
    And the Lord saw, and it was not pleasing unto Him,
    that there was no judgment.
**16** And He looked, and there was no man;
    and He considered, and there was no one who would help.
    And He wrought salvation for them with His arm,
    and by His mercy was He established.
**17** And He put on righteousness as a breastplate,
    and He placed a helmet of salvation upon His head;
    and He clothed Himself with a garment of vengeance,
    and the cloak of zeal.
**18** As one about to render recompense,
    even a reproach to His adversaries,
    [and] vengeance to His enemies,
    to the islands shall He repay recompense.
**19** And those from the west shall fear the name of the Lord,
    and those from the rising of the sun His glorious name.
