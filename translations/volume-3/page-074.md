6 προσώπου Κυρίου· ἀπὸ προσώπου Κυρίου πάσης τῆς γῆς. Ἀνή-
7 γειλαν οἱ οὐρανοὶ τὴν δικαιοσύνην αὐτοῦ· καὶ εἶδοσαν πάντες οἱ
λαοὶ τὴν δόξαν αὐτοῦ. Αἰσχυνθήτωσαν πάντες οἱ προσκυνοῦντες
τοῖς γλυπτοῖς, οἱ ἐγκαυχώμενοι ἐν τοῖς εἰδώλοις αὐτῶν· προσκυ-
8 νήσατε αὐτῷ πάντες οἱ ἄγγελοι αὐτοῦ. Ἤκουσε καὶ εὐφράνθη
Σιὼν, καὶ ἠγαλλιάσαντο αἱ θυγατέρες τῆς Ἰουδαίας, ἕνεκεν τῶν
9 κριμάτων σου Κύριε· ὅτι σὺ Κύριος ὕψιστος ἐπὶ πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν,
10 σφόδρα ὑπερυψώθης ὑπὲρ πάντας τοὺς θεούς. Οἱ ἀγαπῶντες τὸν
Κύριον, μισεῖτε πονηρόν· φυλάσσει Κύριος τὰς ψυχὰς τῶν ὁσίων
11 αὐτοῦ, ἐκ χειρὸς ἁμαρτωλοῦ ῥύσεται αὐτούς. Φῶς ἀνέτειλε τῷ
12 δικαίῳ, καὶ τοῖς εὐθέσι τῇ καρδίᾳ εὐφροσύνη. Εὐφράνθητε δίκαιοι
ἐν τῷ Κυρίῳ, καὶ ἐξομολογεῖσθε τῇ μνήμῃ τῆς ἁγιωσύνης αὐτοῦ.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ϟΖʹ. XCVII.**

1 ΨΑΛΜΟΣ τῷ Δαυΐδ. Ἄσατε τῷ Κυρίῳ ᾆσμα καινὸν, ὅτι
θαυμαστὰ ἐποίησεν (ὁ Κύριος)· ἔσωσεν αὐτῷ ἡ δεξιὰ αὐτοῦ, καὶ
2 ὁ βραχίων ὁ ἅγιος αὐτοῦ. Ἐγνώρισε Κύριος τὸ σωτήριον αὐτοῦ·
3 ἐναντίον τῶν ἐθνῶν ἀπεκάλυψε τὴν δικαιοσύνην αὐτοῦ. Ἐμνήσθη
τοῦ ἐλέους αὐτοῦ (τῷ Ἰακώβ,) καὶ τῆς ἀληθείας αὐτοῦ τῷ οἴκῳ
Ἰσραήλ· εἶδοσαν πάντα τὰ πέρατα τῆς γῆς τὸ σωτήριον τοῦ Θεοῦ
4 ἡμῶν. Ἀλαλάξατε τῷ Κυρίῳ πᾶσα ἡ γῆ· ᾄσατε καὶ ἀγαλλιάσθε
5 καὶ ψάλατε. Ψάλατε τῷ Κυρίῳ ἐν κιθάρᾳ, ἐν κιθάρᾳ καὶ φωνῇ
6 ψαλμοῦ, ἐν σάλπιγξιν ἐλαταῖς καὶ φωνῇ σάλπιγγος κερατίνης·
7 ἀλαλάξατε ἐνώπιον τοῦ βασιλέως Κυρίου. Σαλευθήτω ἡ θάλασσα
καὶ τὸ πλήρωμα αὐτῆς, ἡ οἰκουμένη καὶ (πάντες) οἱ κατοικοῦντες
8 ἐν αὐτῇ. Ποταμοὶ κροτήσουσι χειρὶ ἐπιτοαυτό· τὰ ὄρη ἀγαλλιά-
9 σονται ἀπὸ προσώπου Κυρίου, (ὅτι ἔρχεται,) ὅτι ἥκει κρῖναι τὴν
γῆν· κρινεῖ τὴν οἰκουμένην ἐν δικαιοσύνῃ, καὶ λαοὺς ἐν εὐθύτητι.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ϟΗʹ. XCVIII.**

1 ΨΑΛΜΟΣ τῷ Δαυΐδ. Ὁ Κύριος ἐβασίλευσεν, ὀργιζέσθωσαν
2 λαοί· ὁ καθήμενος ἐπὶ τῶν Χερουβείμ, σαλευθήτω ἡ γῆ. Κύριος ἐν
3 Σιὼν μέγας, καὶ ὑψηλός ἐστιν ἐπὶ πάντας τοὺς λαούς. Ἐξομο-
λογησάσθωσαν τῷ ὀνόματί σου τῷ μεγάλῳ· ὅτι φοβερὸν καὶ ἅγιον

**PSALM XCVI.**
(continued)

6 ...the presence of the Lord,
   [Even] before the Lord of all the earth.
7 The heavens have declared His righteousness,
   And all peoples have seen His glory.
   Confounded be all they that worship graven images,
   Who boast themselves in their idols.
8 Worship Him, all ye His angels.
   Sion heard [this] and was made glad,
   And the daughters of Judea rejoiced,
   Because of Thy judgments, O Lord.
9 For Thou, O Lord, art most high over all the earth;
   Thou art greatly exalted above all gods.
10 Ye that love the Lord, hate evil;
    The Lord preserveth the souls of His saints;
    He shall deliver them from the hand of the sinner.
11 Light hath dawned for the righteous,
    And gladness for the upright in heart.
12 Rejoice, ye righteous, in the Lord,
    And give praise to the remembrance of His holiness.

**PSALM XCVII.**
A Psalm of David.

1 O sing unto the Lord a new song,
   For [the Lord] hath done wondrous things;
   His right hand, and His holy arm,
   Hath wrought salvation for Him.
2 The Lord hath made known His salvation;
   He hath revealed His righteousness before the nations.
3 He hath remembered His mercy [to Jacob],
   And His truth to the house of Israel;
   All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
4 Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth;
   Sing, and rejoice, and chant praises.
5 Chant praises to the Lord with the lyre,
   With the lyre and the voice of a psalm,
6 With trumpets of fir-wood and the voice of a horn-trumpet;
   Make a joyful noise before the Lord the King.
7 Let the sea be moved, and the fullness thereof;
   The world, and [all] they that dwell therein.
8 The rivers shall clap their hands together;
   The mountains shall rejoice
9 Before the presence of the Lord, [for He cometh,]
   For He cometh to judge the earth;
   He shall judge the world with righteousness,
   And the peoples with uprightness.

**PSALM XCVIII.**
A Psalm of David.

1 The Lord hath reigned, let the peoples be enraged;
2 He that sitteth upon the Cherubim, let the earth be moved.
3 The Lord is great in Sion, and He is high above all the peoples.
   Let them give praise to Thy great Name;
   For it is terrible and holy.
