ΙΩΝΑΣ ϛ΄.

ΚΕΦΑΛΑΙΟΝ Α΄. Ι.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς Ἰωνᾶν τὸν τοῦ Ἀμαθί, λέγων·
2 ἀνάστηθι, καὶ πορεύου εἰς τὴν Νινευὴ τὴν πόλιν τὴν μεγάλην,
καὶ κήρυξον ἐν αὐτῇ, ὅτι ἀνέβη ἡ κραυγὴ τῆς κακίας αὐτῆς πρὸς
3 μέ. Καὶ ἀνέστη Ἰωνᾶς τοῦ φυγεῖν εἰς Θαρσεῖς ἀπὸ προσώπου
Κυρίου, καὶ κατέβη εἰς Ἰόππην· καὶ εὗρε πλοῖον βαδίζον εἰς Θαρ-
σεῖς, καὶ ἔδωκε τὸ ναῦλον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐνέβη εἰς αὐτὸ τοῦ πλεῦσαι
4 εἰς Θαρσεῖς μετ᾿ αὐτῶν ἐκ προσώπου Κυρίου. Καὶ Κύριος ἐξή-
γειρε πνεῦμα ἐπὶ τὴν θάλασσαν, καὶ ἐγένετο κλύδων μέγας ἐν τῇ
5 θαλάσσῃ, καὶ τὸ πλοῖον ἐκινδύνευε τοῦ συντριβῆναι. Καὶ ἐφοβή-
θησαν οἱ ναυτικοί, καὶ ἀνεβόησαν ἕκαστος πρὸς τὸν Θεὸν αὐτοῦ,
καὶ ἐκβολὴν ἐποιήσαντο τῶν σκευῶν τῶν ἐν τῷ πλοίῳ εἰς τὴν θά-
λασσαν, τοῦ κουφισθῆναι ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν· Ἰωνᾶς δὲ κατέβη εἰς τὴν κοί-
6 λην τοῦ πλοίου, καὶ ἐκάθευδε, καὶ ἔρεγχε. Καὶ προσῆλθε πρὸς
αὐτὸν ὁ πρωρεύς, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· τί σὺ ῥέγχει; ἀνάστα, καὶ ἐπι-
καλοῦ τὸν Θεόν σου, εἴπως διασώσῃ ὁ Θεὸς ἡμᾶς, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἀ-
7 πολώμεθα. Καὶ εἶπεν ἕκαστος πρὸς τὸν πλησίον αὑτοῦ· δεῦτε βά-
λωμεν κλήρους, καὶ ἐπιγνῶμεν, τίνος ἕνεκεν ἡ κακία αὕτη ἐστὶν
8 ἐν ἡμῖν. Καὶ ἔβαλον κλήρους, καὶ ἔπεσεν ὁ κλῆρος ἐπὶ Ἰωνᾶν. Καὶ
εἶπαν πρὸς αὐτόν· ἀπάγγειλον δὴ ἡμῖν, τίνος ἕνεκεν ἡ κακία αὕ-
τη ἐστὶν ἐν ἡμῖν· τίς σου ἡ ἐργασία ἐστί, καὶ πόθεν ἔρχῃ, καὶ ἐκ
9 ποίας χώρας, καὶ ἐκ ποίου λαοῦ εἶ σύ; Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτούς·
Δοῦλος Κυρίου ἐγώ εἰμι, καὶ τὸν Κύριον Θεὸν τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ἐγὼ
10 σέβομαι, ὃς ἐποίησε τὴν θάλασσαν καὶ τὴν ξηράν. Καὶ ἐφοβήθη-
σαν οἱ ἄνδρες φόβον μέγαν, καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς αὐτόν· τί τοῦτο ἐ-
ποίησας; διότι ἔγνωσαν οἱ ἄνδρες, ὅτι ἐκ προσώπου Κυρίου ἦν φεύ-
11 γων, ὅτι ἀπήγγειλεν αὐτοῖς. Καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς αὐτόν· τί σοι ποιή-
σομεν, καὶ κοπάσει ἡ θάλασσα ἀφ᾿ ἡμῶν; ὅτι ἡ θάλασσα ἐπορεύ-
12 ετο καὶ ἐξήγειρε μᾶλλον κλύδωνα. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰωνᾶς πρὸς αὐτούς·
ἄρατέ με, καὶ ἐμβάλετέ με εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν, καὶ κοπάσει ἡ θάλασσα
ἀφ᾿ ὑμῶν· διότι ἔγνωκα ἐγώ, ὅτι δι᾿ ἐμὲ ὁ κλύδων ὁ μέγας
οὗτος ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς ἐστι.

JONAH
CHAPTER I

**1** Now the word of the LORD came unto Jonah, the son of Amittai, saying:

**2** "Arise, and go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto her, for the cry of her wickedness is come up before My face."

**3** But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the face of the LORD, and he went down to Joppa. And he found a ship bound for Tarshish, and he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to sail with them unto Tarshish, from the face of the LORD.

**4** But the LORD did cast forth a great wind upon the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken.

**5** Then the mariners were afraid, and they cried every man unto his god, and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it for them. But Jonah was gone down into the inner part of the ship; and he lay down, and was fast asleep, and snored.

**6** And the shipmaster came unto him, and said unto him, "What meanest thou, [that] thou snorest? Arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will save us, that we perish not."

**7** And they said every one to his fellow, "Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us."

**8** So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah. Then said they unto him, "Tell us now, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us. What is thine occupation? and whence comest thou? and of what country art thou? and of what people art thou?"

**9** And he answered them, "I am a servant of the LORD; and I worship the LORD, the God of heaven, who hath made the sea and the dry land."

**10** Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, "What is this that thou hast done?" For the men knew that he fled from the face of the LORD, because he had declared it unto them.

**11** Then said they unto him, "What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm for us?" For the sea wrought, and was yet more tempestuous.

**12** And Jonah said unto them, "Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; and the sea shall be calm for you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you."
