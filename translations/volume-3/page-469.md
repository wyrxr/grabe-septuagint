ΚΕΦ. ΜΓ΄. ΙΕΖΕΚΙΗΛ 1407
ὅρασις ἦν ἴδον, κατὰ τὴν ὅρασιν ἦν ἴδον, ὅτε εἰσεπορευόμην τοῦ
χρῖσαι τὴν πόλιν· καὶ ἡ ὅρασις τοῦ ἅρματος εὖ ἴδον, κατὰ τὴν
ὅρασιν ἦν ἴδον ἐπὶ τοῦ ποταμοῦ τοῦ Χοβάρ· καὶ πίπτω ἐπὶ πρό-
σωπόν μου, καὶ δόξα Κυρίου εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸν οἶκον, κατὰ τὴν 4
ὁδὸν τῆς πύλης τῆς βλεπούσης ὁδὸν τὴν κατ᾽ ἀνατολάς. Καὶ ἀνέ- 5
λαβέ με πνεῦμα, καὶ εἰσήγαγέ με εἰς τὴν αὐλὴν τὴν ἐσωτέραν·
καὶ ἰδοὺ πλήρης δόξης Κυρίου ὁ οἶκος. Καὶ ἔστην· καὶ ἰδοὺ φωνὴ 6
ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου λαλοῦντος πρός μέ, καὶ ἀνὴρ εἱστήκει ἐχόμενός μου,
καὶ εἶπε πρὸς μέ· ἑώρακας, υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, τὸν τόπον τοῦ θρόνου 7
μου, καὶ τὸν τόπον τοῦ ἴχνους τῶν ποδῶν μου· ἐν οἷς κατασκῆ-
νώσει τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ οἴκου Ἰσραὴλ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα·
καὶ οὐ μὴ βεβηλώσουσιν οὐκέτι ὁ οἶκος Ἰσραὴλ τὸ ὄνομά μου τὸ
ἅγιον αὐτοὶ καὶ οἱ ἡγούμενοι αὐτῶν ἐν τῇ πορνείᾳ αὐτῶν, καὶ
ἐν τοῖς φόνοις τῶν ἡγουμένων ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῶν, ἐν τῷ τιθέναι 8
αὐτοὺς τὸ πρόθυρόν μου ἐν τοῖς προθύροις αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰς φλιὰς
μου ἐχομένας τῶν φλιῶν αὐτῶν· καὶ ἔδωκαν τὸν τοῖχόν μου
ὡς συνεχομένον ἐμοῦ καὶ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐβεβήλωσαν τὸ ὄνομα τὸ
ἅγιόν μου ἐν ταῖς ἀνομίαις αὐτῶν αἷς ἐποίουν· καὶ ἐξέτριψα αὐ-
τοὺς ἐν θυμῷ μου, καὶ ἐν φόνῳ. Καὶ νῦν ἀπωσάσθωσαν τὴν πορ- 9
νείαν αὐτῶν, καὶ τοὺς φόνους τῶν ἡγουμένων αὐτῶν ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ,
καὶ κατασκηνώσω ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῶν εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα. Καὶ σὺ υἱὲ ἀνθρώ- 10
που, δεῖξον τῷ οἴκῳ Ἰσραὴλ τὸν οἶκον, καὶ κοπάσσουσιν ἀπὸ τῶν
ἁμαρτιῶν αὐτῶν· καὶ τὴν ὅρασιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὴν διάταξιν αὐτῶν,
καὶ αὐτοὶ λήψονται τὴν κόλασιν αὐτῶν περὶ πάντων ὧν ἐποίησαν· 11
καὶ διαγράψας τὸν οἶκον, καὶ τὴν ἑτοιμασίαν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰς ἐξό-
δους αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰς εἰσόδους αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὴν ὑπόστασιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ
πάντα τὰ προστάγματα αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντα τὰ νόμιμα αὐτοῦ γνω-
ρίσεις αὐτοῖς, καὶ διαγράψεις ἐναντίον αὐτῶν, καὶ φυλάξονται πάν-
τα τὰ δικαιώματά μου, καὶ πάντα τὰ προστάγματά μου, καὶ ποιή-
σουσιν αὐτά. Καὶ τὴν διαγραφὴν τοῦ οἴκου ἐπὶ τῆς κορυφῆς τοῦ 12
ὄρους, πάντα τὰ ὅρια κυκλόθεν ἅγια ἁγίων εἰσίν· οὗτος ὁ νόμος
τοῦ οἴκου. Καὶ ταῦτα τὰ μέτρα τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου· ἐν πήχει τοῦ 13
πήχεως καὶ παλαιστῆς τὸ κόλπωμα βάθος, πῆχυς ἐπὶ πῆχυν, καὶ
πῆχυς τὸ εὖρος, καὶ γεῖσος ἐπὶ τοῦ χείλους αὐτοῦ κυκλόθεν, σπι-
θαμῆς τὸ ἕν· καὶ τοῦτο τὸ ὕψος τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου ἐκ βάθους 14
τῆς ἀρχῆς τοῦ κοιλώματος αὐτοῦ, πρὸς τὸ ἱλαστήριον τὸ μέγα
1408 ΙΕΖΕΚΙΗΛ ΚΕΦ. ΜΓ΄.
τὸ ὑποκάτωθεν πηχῶν δύο, καὶ τὸ εὖρος πήχεως· καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ
ἱλαστηρίου τοῦ μικροῦ ἐπὶ τὸ ἱλαστήριον τὸ μέγα, πήχεις τέσ-
15 σαρες, καὶ εὖρος πήχεως. Καὶ τὸ ἀριὴλ πηχῶν τεσσάρων, καὶ
ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀριήλ, καὶ ὑπεράνω τῶν κεράτων πήχυς. 16 Καὶ τὸ ἀριὴλ
πηχῶν δώδεκα μήκους, ἐπὶ πήχεις δώδεκα πλάτους, τετράγωνον
ἐπὶ τὰ τέσσαρα μέρη αὐτοῦ. 17 Καὶ τὸ ἱλαστήριον πηχῶν δεκατεσσάρων τὸ μῆκος, ἐπὶ πήχεις δεκατέσσαρας· τὸ εὖρος τετράγωνον
ἐπὶ τὰ τέσσαρα μέρη αὐτοῦ· καὶ τὸ γεῖσος αὐτῷ κυκλόθεν κυκλούμενον αὐτῷ ἥμισυ πήχεως· καὶ τὸ κύκλωμα αὐτοῦ, πῆχυς
κυκλόθεν, καὶ οἱ κλιμακτῆρες αὐτοῦ, βλέποντες κατ᾽ ἀνατολάς.
18 Καὶ εἶπε πρός μέ· υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσ-
ραήλ· ταῦτα τὰ προστάγματα τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου, ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ποι-
ήσεως αὐτοῦ, τοῦ ἀναφέρειν ἐπ᾽ αὐτοῦ τὰ ὁλοκαυτώματα, καὶ
19 προσχέειν πρὸς αὐτὸ αἷμα. Καὶ δώσεις τοῖς ἱερεῦσι τοῖς Λευΐταις
τοῖς ἐκ τοῦ σπέρματος Σαδδούχ, καὶ τοῖς ἐγγίζουσι πρὸς μέ, λέ-
γει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ Λευΐ, τοῦ λειτουργεῖν μοι μόσχον ἐκ βοῶν
20 περὶ ἁμαρτίας. Καὶ λήψονται ἐκ τοῦ αἵματος αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπιθή-
σουσιν ἐπὶ τὰ τέσσαρα κέρατα τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς
τέσσαρας γωνίας τοῦ ἱλαστηρίου, καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν βάσιν κύκλῳ, καὶ
21 περιραντιεῖς αὐτὸ, καὶ ἐξιλάσονται αὐτό. Καὶ λήψονται τὸν μό-
σχον τὸν περὶ ἁμαρτίας, καὶ κατακαυθήσεται ἐν τῷ ἀποκεχωρι-
22 σμένῳ τοῦ οἴκου, ἔξωθεν τῶν ἁγίων. Καὶ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ δευτέρᾳ λήψονται ἐρίφους δύο ἀπὸ αἰγῶν ἀμώμους ὑπὲρ ἁμαρτίας,
καὶ ἐξιλάσονται τὸ θυσιαστήριον, καθὼς ἐξιλάσαντο ἐν τῷ μόσχῳ.
23 Καὶ μετὰ τὸ συντελέσαι σε τὸν ἐξιλασμὸν, προσποιήσου μόσχον
24 ἐκ βοῶν ἄμωμον, καὶ κριὸν ἐκ τῶν προβάτων ἄμωμον, καὶ προ-
σοίσετε ἐναντίον Κυρίου· καὶ ἐπιρίψουσιν οἱ ἱερεῖς ἐπ᾽ αὐτὰ ἅλας,
25 καὶ ἀνοίσουσιν αὐτὰ ὁλοκαυτώματα τῷ Κυρίῳ. Ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας
ποιήσεις ἔριφον ὑπὲρ ἁμαρτίας καθ᾽ ἡμέραν, καὶ μόσχον ἐκ βοῶν
26 καὶ κριὸν ἐκ τῶν προβάτων, ἄμωμα ποιήσουσιν ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας·
καὶ ἐξιλάσονται τὸ θυσιαστήριον, καὶ καθαρίσουσιν αὐτὸ, καὶ πλήσουσιν
27 τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν. Καὶ συντελέσουσι τὰς ἡμέρας, καὶ ἔσται ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέρας τῆς ὀγδόης καὶ ἐπέκεινα, ποιήσουσιν οἱ
ἱερεῖς ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον τὰ ὁλοκαυτώματα ὑμῶν, καὶ τὰ τοῦ
σωτηρίου ὑμῶν· καὶ προσδέξομαι ὑμᾶς, λέγει Κύριος Κύριος.

**Ezekiel 43**

3 which I saw, according to the vision which I saw when I went in to anoint the city; and the vision of the chariot I saw well, according to the vision which I saw by the river Chobar; and I fell upon my face. And the glory of the Lord came into the house by the way of the gate that looked toward the east.

5 And the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me into the inner court; and behold, the house was full of the glory of the Lord.

6 And I stood, and lo, a voice [came] from the house, speaking unto me, and a man stood beside me. 7 And he spake unto me: "Thou hast seen, son of man, the place of My throne, and the place of the sole of My feet, wherein My name shall dwell in the midst of the house of Israel forever. And the house of Israel shall no more profane My holy name, neither they, nor their leaders, by their fornication, and by the murders of their leaders in their midst; 8 in that they placed their threshold by My threshold, and their doorposts nigh unto their doorposts; and they made My wall to be as though it were contiguous with Me and with them. And they did profane My holy name by their iniquities which they committed. And I destroyed them in My wrath, and in slaughter.

9 And now, let them put away their fornication, and the murders of their leaders, from Me, and I shall dwell in their midst forever.

10 And thou, son of man, show the house unto the house of Israel, and they shall cease from their sins. And [show them] its vision and its arrangement. 11 And they themselves shall receive their punishment concerning all that they have done. And having drawn out the house, and its preparation, and its exits, and its entrances, and its structure, and all its ordinances, and all its statutes, thou shalt make them known unto them, and thou shalt draw them before them; and they shall keep all My judgments, and all My ordinances, and perform them.

12 And the delineation of the house upon the top of the mountain, all its borders round about, are Most Holy. This is the law of the house.

13 And these are the measures of the altar: by the cubit, [which is] a cubit and a palm. The hollow of the base [shall be] a depth of a cubit by a cubit, and a cubit [is] its breadth. And a cornice upon its edge round about, of a span [is] the one [part]. 14 And this is the height of the altar from the depth of the beginning of its hollow, unto the great altar-hearth underneath, [which is] two cubits, and its breadth a cubit. And from the small altar-hearth unto the great altar-hearth, [it is] four cubits, and a cubit [in] breadth.

15 And the Ariel [shall be] four cubits. And from the Ariel, even above the horns, [it is] one cubit. 16 And the Ariel [shall be] twelve cubits in length, by twelve cubits in breadth, square upon its four sides. 17 And the altar-hearth [shall be] fourteen cubits the length, by fourteen cubits; the breadth [is] square upon its four sides. And its cornice around it, encircling it, [is] half a cubit. And its surrounding channel, [is] a cubit round about. And its steps [shall be] looking toward the east.

18 And he spake unto me: "Son of man, thus saith the Lord God of Israel: These are the ordinances of the altar, in the day of its making, for to offer upon it the burnt offerings, and to pour out blood unto it. 19 And thou shalt give unto the priests, the Levites, who are of the seed of Zadok, and who draw near unto Me, saith the Lord God of Levi, a bullock of the herd for a sin offering to minister unto Me. 20 And they shall take of its blood, and shall put it upon the four horns of the altar, and upon the four corners of the altar-hearth, and upon the base round about; and thou shalt sprinkle it, and they shall make atonement for it. 21 And they shall take the bullock for the sin offering, and it shall be burnt in the place set apart of the house, outside the holy [places].

22 And on the second day, they shall take two unblemished he-goats from the goats for a sin offering; and they shall make atonement for the altar, as they made atonement with the bullock. 23 And after thou hast completed the atonement, thou shalt prepare for thyself an unblemished bullock of the herd, and an unblemished ram from the sheep. 24 And ye shall offer them before the Lord; and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and shall offer them up as burnt offerings unto the Lord.

25 Seven days shalt thou make a he-goat for a sin offering daily, and a bullock of the herd and a ram from the sheep; they shall prepare them unblemished for seven days. 26 And they shall make atonement for the altar, and shall cleanse it, and shall consecrate themselves. 27 And they shall complete the days; and it shall be that from the eighth day and thereafter, the priests shall offer your burnt offerings upon the altar, and your offerings of well-being; and I will accept you, saith the Lord GOD."
