1 ἤκουσέ μου. Ἀναστήσομαι δὴ, καὶ κυκλώσω ἐν τῇ πόλει, ἐν ταῖς
ἀγοραῖς καὶ ἐν ταῖς πλατείαις, καὶ ζητήσω ὃν ἠγάπησεν ἡ ψυχή
2 μου· ἐζήτησα αὐτὸν, καὶ οὐχ εὗρον· ἐκάλεσα αὐτὸν, καὶ οὐχ
ὑπήκουσέ μου.
3 Εὗρόν με οἱ τηροῦντες, οἱ κυκλοῦντες ἐν τῇ πόλει· μὴ ὃν ἠγάπησεν ἡ ψυχή μου, ἴδετε;
4 Ὡς μικρὸν ὅτε παρῆλθον ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν, ἕως οὗ εὗρον ὃν ἠγάπησεν ἡ ψυχή μου· ἐκράτησα αὐτὸν, καὶ οὐκ ἀφήσω αὐτὸν, ἕως οὗ εἰσήγαγον αὐτὸν εἰς οἶκον μητρός μου, καὶ εἰς ταμιεῖον τῆς συλλαβούσης με.
5 Ὤρκισα ὑμᾶς θυγατέρες Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐν ταῖς δυνάμεσι καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἰσχύσι τοῦ ἀγροῦ· ἐὰν ἐγείρητε καὶ ἐξεγείρητε τὴν ἀγάπην, ἕως ἂν θελήσῃ.
6 Τίς αὕτη ἡ ἀναβαίνουσα ἀπὸ τῆς ἐρήμου, ὡς στελέχη καπνοῦ, τεθυμιαμένη σμύρναν καὶ λίβανον ἀπὸ πάντων κονιορτῶν μυρεψοῦ;
7 Ἰδοὺ ἡ κλίνη τοῦ Σαλωμὼν, ἑξήκοντα δυνατοὶ κύκλῳ αὐτῆς ἀπὸ δυνατῶν Ἰσραήλ·
8 πάντες κατέχοντες ῥομφαίαν, δεδιδαγμένοι πόλεμον· ἀνὴρ ῥομφαία αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ μηρὸν αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ θάμβους ἐν νυξί.
9 Φορεῖον ἐποίησεν ἑαυτῷ ὁ βασιλεὺς Σαλωμὼν ἀπὸ ξύλων τοῦ Λιβάνου.
10 Στύλους αὐτοῦ ἐποίησεν ἀργύριον, καὶ ἀνάκλιτον αὐτοῦ χρύσεον· ἐπίβασις αὐτοῦ πορφυρᾶ, ἐντὸς αὐτοῦ λιθόστρωτον ἀγάπην ἀπὸ θυγατέρων Ἱερουσαλήμ.
11 Ἐξέλθατε καὶ ἴδετε θυγατέρες Σιὼν ἐν τῷ βασιλεῖ Σαλωμὼν, ἐν τῷ στεφάνῳ ᾧ ἐστεφάνωσεν αὐτὸν ἡ μήτηρ αὐτοῦ, ἐν ἡμέρᾳ νυμφεύσεως αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐν ἡμέρᾳ εὐφροσύνης καρδίας αὐτοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. Δ΄.
1 ἸΔΟΥ εἶ καλὴ ἡ πλησίον μου, ἰδοὺ εἶ καλὴ· ὀφθαλμοί σου περιστεραὶ, ἐκτὸς τῆς σιωπήσεως σου· τρίχωμά σου ὡς ἀγέλαι τῶν αἰγῶν, αἱ ἀπεκαλύφθησαν ἀπὸ τοῦ Γαλαάδ.
2 Ὁδόντες σου ὡς ἀγέλαι τῶν κεκαρμένων, αἱ ἀνέβησαν ἀπὸ τοῦ λουτροῦ, αἱ πᾶσαι διδυμεύουσαι, καὶ ἀτεκνοῦσα οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν αὐταῖς.
3 Ὡς σπαρτίον τὸ κόκκινον χείλη σου, καὶ ἡ λαλιά σου ὡραία· ὡς λέπυρον τῆς ῥοᾶς μῆλόν σου, ἐκτὸς τῆς σιωπήσεώς σου.
4 Ὡς πύργος Δαυὶδ τράχηλός σου, ὁ ᾠκοδομημένος εἰς Θαλφιώθ· χίλιοι θυρεοὶ κρέμανται ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν, πᾶσαι βολίδες τῶν δυνατῶν.
5 Δύο μαστοί σου ὡς δύο νεβροὶ δίδυμοι δορκάδος, οἱ νεμόμενοι ἐν κρίνοις,
6 ἕως διαπνεύσῃ ἡ ἡμέρα καὶ κινηθῶσιν αἱ σκιαί. Πορεύσομαι ἐμαυτῷ πρὸς τὸ ὄρος.

**CHAPTER 3**

**1** yet he answered me not.
    Then I will rise now, and will go about the city,
    in the markets and in the broad ways,
    and I will seek him whom my soul loveth.
**2** I sought him, but I found him not;
    I called him, but he answered me not.
**3** The watchmen that went about the city found me;
    [to whom I said,] "Have ye seen him whom my soul loveth?"
**4** It was but a little while that I passed from them,
    but I found him whom my soul loveth:
    I held him, and would not let him go,
    until I had brought him into my mother's house,
    and into the chamber of her that conceived me.
**5** I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
    by the powers and by the strengths of the field,
    that ye stir not up, nor awaken love,
    until it pleaseth [Him].
**6** Who is this that cometh up out of the wilderness
    like columns of smoke,
    perfumed with myrrh and frankincense,
    from all the powders of the perfumer?
**7** Behold, the litter of Solomon!
    Threescore valiant men are round about it,
    of the mighty men of Israel;
**8** All holding a sword, well-taught in war;
    every man hath his sword upon his thigh,
    because of dread in the nights.
**9** King Solomon made for himself a palanquin
    of the wood of Lebanon.
**10** He made its pillars of silver,
    and its back-rest of gold;
    its steps were of purple,
    and within it was a paving of love
    from the daughters of Jerusalem.
**11** Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion,
    and behold King Solomon,
    in the crown wherewith his mother crowned him,
    in the day of his espousals,
    and in the day of the gladness of his heart.

**CHAPTER 4**

**1** Behold, thou art fair, my beloved,
    behold, thou art fair;
    thine eyes are [as] doves, apart from thy silence;
    thy hair is as flocks of goats
    that have appeared from Gilead.
**2** Thy teeth are as flocks of shorn [sheep]
    that have come up from the washing,
    all of them bearing twins,
    and not one is barren among them.
**3** Thy lips are as a scarlet thread,
    and thy speech is comely;
    thy temples are as a segment of a pomegranate,
    apart from thy silence.
**4** Thy neck is like the tower of David,
    built for armories;
    a thousand shields hang upon it,
    all the missiles of the mighty.
**5** Thy two breasts are like two fawns,
    twins of a gazelle,
    that feed among the lilies,
**6** Until the day breatheth through,
    and the shadows do lengthen.
    I will get me to the mountain.
