ΚΕΦ. ΙΑ΄.
κατὰ ἀριθμὸν τῶν πόλεών σου ἦσαν θεοί σου ᾿Ιούδα, καὶ κατὰ ἀριθμὸν ἐξόδων τῆς Ἱερουσαλήμ, ἐτάξατε βωμοὺς τῇ αἰσχύνῃ θυσιαστήρια τοῦ θυμιᾶν τῇ Βάαλ. Καὶ σὺ μὴ προσεύχου ὑπὲρ τοῦ λαοῦ 14
τούτου καὶ μὴ ἀξίου περὶ αὐτῶν ἐν δεήσει καὶ προσευχῇ, ὅτι οὐκ
εἰσακούσομαί με ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐπικαλεῖσθαί με, ἐν καιρῷ κακώσεως
αὐτῶν. Τί ἡ ἠγαπημένη ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ μου ἐποίησε βδέλυγμα; μὴ 15
εὐχαὶ καὶ κρέα ἅγια ἀφελοῦσιν ἀπὸ σοῦ τὰς κακίας σου, ἢ τούτοις
διαφεύξῃ; ᾿Ελαίαν ὡραίαν εὔσκιον τῷ εἴδει ἐκάλεσε Κύριος τὸ 16
ὄνομά σου, εἰς φωνὴν περιτομῆς αὐτῆς· ἀνήφθη πῦρ ἐπ᾿ αὐτήν,
μεγάλη ἡ θλῖψις ἐπὶ σέ, ἠρειώθησαν οἱ κλάδοι αὐτῆς,
καὶ Κύριος ὁ καταφυτεύσας σε, ἐλάλησεν ἐπὶ σὲ κακὰ ἀντὶ 17
τῆς κακίας οἴκου ᾿Ισραὴλ καὶ οἴκου ᾿Ιούδα, ὅτι ἐποίησαν αὐτοῖς
τοῦ παροργίσαι με ἐν τῷ θυμιᾶν αὐτοὺς τῇ Βάαλ. Κύριε, γνώρισόν 18
μοι, καὶ γνώσομαι· τότε ἴδον τὰ ἐπιτηδεύματα αὐτῶν, ἐγὼ δὲ ὡς 19
ἀρνίον ἄκακον ἀγόμενον τοῦ θύεσθαι, οὐκ ἔγνων· ἔτι ἐπ᾿ ἐμὲ ἐλογίσαντο
λογισμὸν πονηρόν, κατὰ σοῦ λέγοντες· δεῦτε καὶ ἐμβά-
λωμεν ξύλον εἰς τὸν ἄρτον τράχηλον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐκτρίψωμεν αὐτὸν
ἀπὸ γῆς ζώντων, καὶ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ οὐ μὴ μνησθῇ ἔτι. Κύριε, κρῖνον 20
δίκαια, δοκιμάζων νεφροὺς καὶ καρδίας, ἴδοιμι τὴν παρὰ σοῦ
ἐκδίκησιν ἐξ αὐτῶν, ὅτι πρὸς σὲ ἀπεκάλυψα τὰ δικαίωμά μου. Διὰ 21
τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἐπὶ τοὺς ἄνδρας ᾿Αναθὼθ τοὺς
ζητοῦντας τὴν ψυχήν μου, τοὺς λέγοντας, οὐ μὴ προφητεύσῃς ἐπὶ
τῷ ὀνόματι Κυρίου, εἰ δὲ μή, ἀποθάνῃ ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν ἡμῶν. Διὰ 22
τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Κύριος τῶν δυνάμεων, ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐπισκέψομαι ἐπ᾿
αὐτούς· οἱ νεανίσκοι αὐτῶν ἐν μαχαίρᾳ ἀποθανοῦνται, καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ
αὐτῶν καὶ αἱ θυγατέρες αὐτῶν τελευτήσουσιν ἐν λιμῷ, καὶ ἐγκατάλειμμα 23
οὐκ ἔσται αὐτῶν, ὅτι ἐπάξω κακὰ ἐπὶ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας
ἐν ᾿Αναθώθ, ἐν ἐνιαυτῷ ἐπισκέψεως αὐτῶν.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΒ΄. ΧΙΙ.

**1** ΔΙΚΑΙΟΣ εἶ Κύριε, ὅτι ἀπολογήσομαι πρὸς σέ· πλὴν κρίματα
λαλήσω πρὸς σέ· τί ὅτι ὁδὸς ἀσεβῶν εὐοδοῦται; εὐθήνησαν
πάντες οἱ ἀθετοῦντες ἀθετήσει; ᾿Εφύτευσας αὐτούς, καὶ ἐρριζώθησαν· 2
ἐτεκνοποίησαν, καὶ ἐποίησαν καρπόν· ἐγγὺς εἶ σὺ τοῦ
στόματος αὐτῶν, καὶ πόῤῥω ἀπὸ τῶν νεφρῶν αὐτῶν. Καὶ σύ, Κύ- 3

**15** What hath My beloved wrought in My house, [even] an abomination? Shall supplications and holy meat remove thy evils from thee, or by these means shalt thou escape?
**16** A fair olive tree, well-shaded in appearance, the Lord called thy name. At the sound of its pruning, fire was kindled upon it; great is the tribulation upon thee, and its branches were broken.
**17** And the Lord who planted thee, He hath spoken evils against thee, in return for the wickedness of the house of Israel and the house of Judah, because they have wrought for themselves to provoke Me when they burned incense unto Baal.
**18** O Lord, make [it] known unto me, and I shall know! Then did I see their devices, but I, as a harmless lamb led to the slaughter, knew it not.
**19** Yet, against me they devised a wicked plot, saying concerning thee: "Come, let us cast wood into his bread, [and] his neck; and let us utterly destroy him from the land of the living, and his name shall be remembered no more."
**20** O Lord, who judgest righteously, who triest the reins and the hearts, may I see Thy vengeance upon them, for unto Thee have I revealed my just cause.
**21** Therefore thus saith the Lord God concerning the men of Anathoth, who seek my life, who say: "Thou shalt not prophesy in the name of the Lord, lest thou die by our hands."
**22** Therefore thus saith the Lord of Hosts: "Behold, I will visit them: their young men shall die by the sword, and their sons and their daughters shall perish by famine;
**23** and no remnant shall be left of them, for I will bring evils upon the inhabitants of Anathoth in the year of their visitation."

### CHAPTER XII.

**1** Righteous art Thou, O Lord, when I plead with Thee; yet will I speak judgments unto Thee: "Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? Are all they enriched who transgress with faithlessness indeed?"
**2** Thou hast planted them, and they are rooted; they have brought forth offspring, and they have yielded fruit. Thou art near to their mouth, but far from their reins.
**3** But Thou, O Lord—
