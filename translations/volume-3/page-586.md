ΚΕΦ. ΙΑ΄.
νούντων ποιμένων, ὅτι τεταλαίπωρηκεν ἡ μεγαλωσύνη αὐτῶν·
φωνὴ ὠρυομένων λεόντων, ὅτι τεταλαίπωρηκε τὸ φρύαγμα τοῦ
Ἰορδάνου. Τάδε λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ· ποιμαίνετε τὰ πρό-
3 βατα τῆς σφαγῆς, ἃ οἱ κτησάμενοι κατέσφαζον, καὶ οὐ μετε-
μέλοντο, καὶ οἱ πωλοῦντες αὐτὰ ἔλεγον· εὐλογητὸς Κύριος, καὶ
πεπλουτήκαμεν, καὶ οἱ ποιμένες αὐτῶν οὐκ ἔπασχον οὐδὲν ἐπ᾿
6 αὐτοῖς. Διὰ τοῦτο οὐ φείσομαι οὐκέτι ἐπὶ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας
τὴν γῆν, λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ· καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ παραδίδωμι
τοὺς ἀνθρώπους, ἕκαστον εἰς χεῖρα τοῦ πλησίον αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἰς
χεῖρα βασιλέως αὐτοῦ, καὶ κατακόψουσι τὴν γῆν, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἐξε-
7 λούμαι ἐκ χειρὸς αὐτῶν. Καὶ ποιμανῶ τὰ πρόβατα τῆς σφαγῆς
εἰς τὴν Χαναανίτιν· καὶ λήψομαι ἐμαυτῷ δύο ῥάβδους, τὴν μίαν
ἐκάλεσα κάλλος, καὶ τὴν ἑτέραν ἐκάλεσα σχοίνισμα· καὶ ποι-
8 μανῶ τὰ πρόβατα. Καὶ ἐξαρῶ τοὺς τρεῖς ποιμένας ἐν μηνὶ ἑνί,
καὶ βαρυνθήσεται ἡ ψυχή μου ἐπ᾿ αὐτούς· καὶ γὰρ αἱ ψυχαὶ αὐ-
9 τῶν ἐπωρύοντο ἐπ᾿ ἐμέ. Καὶ εἶπα· οὐ ποιμανῶ ὑμᾶς, τὸ ἀπο-
θνῆσκον ἀποθνησκέτω, καὶ τὸ ἐκλεῖπον ἐκλειπέτω, καὶ τὰ κατά-
λοιπα κατεσθιέτωσαν ἕκαστος τὰς σάρκας τοῦ πλησίον αὐτοῦ.
10 Καὶ λήψομαι τὴν ῥάβδον μου τὴν καλήν, καὶ ἀποῤῥίψω αὐτήν,
τοῦ διασκεδάσαι τὴν διαθήκην μου ἣν διεθέμην πρὸς πάντας τοὺς
11 λαούς· καὶ διασκεδασθήσεται ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, καὶ γνώσονται
οἱ Χαναναῖοι τὰ πρόβατα τὰ φυλασσόμενά μοι, διότι λόγος Κυ-
12 ρίου ἐστί. Καὶ ἐρῶ πρὸς αὐτούς· εἰ καλὸν ἐνώπιον ὑμῶν ἐστι,
δότε στήσαντες τὸν μισθόν μου, ἢ ἀπείπασθε· καὶ ἔστησαν τὸν
13 μισθόν μου τριάκοντα ἀργυροῦς. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς μέ· κάθες
αὐτοὺς εἰς τὸ χωνευτήριον, καὶ σκέψομαι αὐτὸ εἰ δόκιμόν ἐστιν,
ὃν τρόπον ἐδοκιμάσθην ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἔλαβον τοὺς τριάκοντα
ἀργυροῦς, καὶ ἐνέβαλον αὐτοὺς εἰς οἶκον Κυρίου εἰς τὸ χωνευ-
14 τήριον. Καὶ ἀπέῤῥιψα τὴν ῥάβδον τὴν δευτέραν τὸ σχοίνισμα,
τοῦ διασκεδάσαι τὴν διαθήκην μου ἀναμέσον Ἰούδα, καὶ ἀναμέσον
15 τοῦ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς μέ· ἔτι λάβε σεαυτῷ σκεύη
16 ποιμένος ἀπείρου ποιμενικά· διότι ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐξεγείρω ποιμένα
ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, τὸ ἐκλιμπάνον οὐ μὴ ἐπισκέψηται, καὶ τὸ διεσκορ-
πισμένον οὐ μὴ ζητήσῃ, καὶ τὸ συντετριμμένον οὐ μὴ ἰάσηται,
καὶ τὸ ὁλόκληρον οὐ μὴ κατευθύνῃ, καὶ τὰ κρέα τῶν ἐκλεκτῶν
17 καταφάγεται, καὶ τοὺς ἀστραγάλους αὐτῶν ἐκστρέψει. Ὦ οἱ

**Zechariah [Chapter] 11**

A voice of lamenting shepherds, for their glory is distressed; a voice of roaring lions, for the pride of the Jordan is distressed.

**4** Thus saith the Lord Almighty: Feed ye the sheep of the slaughter, which their owners did slay and repented not; and they that sold them said, Blessed be the Lord, for we are enriched; and their shepherds pitied them not.
**5** Therefore will I no more spare the inhabitants of the land, saith the Lord Almighty. And behold, I will deliver the men, every one into the hand of his neighbor, and into the hand of his king; and they shall smite the land, and I will not deliver [any] out of their hand.
**6** And I will feed the sheep of the slaughter in the land of Canaan. And I took unto Me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and so I fed the sheep.
**7** And I cut off the three shepherds in one month; for My soul became impatient with them, and their souls also loathed Me.
**8** Then said I, I will not feed you. That which dieth, let it die; and that which is cut off, let it be cut off; and let the remnant devour, every one, the flesh of his neighbor.
**9** And I took My staff, even Beauty, and cast it away, that I might break My covenant which I had made with all the peoples.
**10** And it shall be broken in that day. And the merchants shall know concerning the sheep that were kept for Me, that it is the word of the Lord.
**11** And I said unto them, If it be good in your eyes, give Me My hire; or forbear. So they weighed for My hire thirty pieces of silver.
**12** And the Lord said unto Me, Cast them into the smelting-furnace, and I shall see whether it be genuine, in what manner I was tested concerning them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them into the house of the Lord, [even] into the smelting-furnace.
**13** And I cast away My second staff, even Bands, that I might break My covenant between Judah and between Israel.
**14** And the Lord said unto Me, Yet take unto thyself the equipment of a foolish shepherd.
**15** For behold, I will raise up a shepherd upon the land, who shall not visit that which is perishing, nor seek that which is scattered, nor heal that which is broken, nor guide that which is whole; but he shall eat the flesh of the choice ones, and shall tear off their hoofs.
**16** Woe to the shepherds that feed upon vanity, and that forsake the sheep! A sword shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye. His arm shall be withered, yea, withered; and his right eye, being blinded, shall be utterly blinded.
