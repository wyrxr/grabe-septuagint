**ΨΑΛΜ. ϟΓʹ. XCIII.**

10 οὐχὶ ἀκούει; Ὁ πλάσας τὸν ὀφθαλμόν, οὐχὶ κατανοεῖ; Ὁ παι-
11 δεύων ἔθνη, οὐχὶ ἐλέγχει, ὁ διδάσκων ἄνθρωπον γνῶσιν; Κύριος
12 γινώσκει τοὺς διαλογισμοὺς τῶν ἀνθρώπων, ὅτι εἰσὶ μάταιοι. Μα-
   κάριος ἄνθρωπος, ὃν ἂν παιδεύσῃς Κύριε, καὶ ἐκ τοῦ νόμου σου
13 διδάξῃς αὐτόν· τοῦ πραΰναι αὐτῷ ἀφ᾿ ἡμερῶν πονηρῶν, ἕως οὗ ὀρυ-
14 γῇ τῷ ἁμαρτωλῷ βόθρος. Ὅτι οὐκ ἀπώσεται Κύριος τὸν λαὸν
15 αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὴν κληρονομίαν αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἐγκαταλείψει· ἕως οὗ δι-
   καιοσύνη ἐπιστρέψῃ εἰς κρίσιν, καὶ ἐχόμενοι αὐτῆς πάντες οἱ εὐ-
16 θεῖς τῇ καρδίᾳ. Διάψαλμα. Τίς ἀναστήσεταί μοι ἐπὶ πονηρευομέ-
17 νους; ἢ τίς συμπαραστήσεταί μοι ἐπὶ τοὺς ἐργαζομένους τὴν ἀνο-
18 μίαν; Εἰ μὴ ὅτι Κύριος ἐβοήθησέ μοι, παραβραχὺ παρῴκησε τῷ
19 ᾅδῃ ἡ ψυχή μου. Εἰ ἔλεγον, σεσάλευται ὁ ποὺς μου, τὸ ἔλεός σου
20 Κύριε ἐβοήθει μοι· κατὰ τὸ πλῆθος τῶν ὀδυνῶν μου ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ
21 μου, αἱ παρακλήσεις σου ηὔφραναν τὴν ψυχήν μου. Μὴ συμπροστέ-
22 σται σοι θρόνος ἀνομίας, ὁ πλάσσων κόπον ἐπὶ πρόσταγμα; Θη-
23 ρεύσουσιν ἐπὶ ψυχὴν δικαίου, καὶ αἷμα ἀθώων καταδικάσονται.
24 Καὶ ἐγένετό μοι Κύριος εἰς καταφυγήν, καὶ ὁ Θεός μου εἰς βοη-
25 θὸν ἐλπίδος μου· καὶ ἀποδώσει αὐτοῖς (Κύριος κατὰ) τὴν ἀνομίαν
26 αὐτῶν, καὶ κατὰ τὴν πονηρίαν αὐτῶν ἀφανιεῖ αὐτούς· ἀφανιεῖ
27 αὐτοὺς Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ϟΔʹ. XCIV.**

1 ΑΙΝΟΣ ᾠδῆς τῷ Δαυΐδ. Δεῦτε ἀγαλλιασώμεθα τῷ Κυρίῳ,
2 ἀλαλάξωμεν τῷ Θεῷ τῷ σωτῆρι ἡμῶν· προφθάσωμεν τὸ πρόσω-
3 πον αὐτοῦ ἐν ἐξομολογήσει, καὶ ἐν ψαλμοῖς ἀλαλάξωμεν αὐτῷ.
4 Ὅτι Θεὸς μέγας Κύριος, καὶ βασιλεὺς μέγας ἐπὶ πάντας τοὺς
5 θεούς. Ὅτι ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ τὰ πέρατα τῆς γῆς, καὶ τὰ ὕψη
6 τῶν ὀρέων αὐτοῦ εἰσιν· ὅτι αὐτοῦ ἐστιν ἡ θάλασσα, καὶ αὐτὸς
7 ἐποίησεν αὐτήν, καὶ τὴν ξηράν αἱ χεῖρες αὐτοῦ ἔπλασαν. Δεῦτε
8 προσκυνήσωμεν καὶ προσπέσωμεν (αὐτῷ), καὶ κλαύσωμεν ἐναντίον
9 Κυρίου τοῦ ποιήσαντος ἡμᾶς· ἔτι αὐτὸς ἐστιν ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν, καὶ
10 ἡμεῖς λαὸς νομῆς αὐτοῦ καὶ πρόβατα τῆς χειρὸς αὐτοῦ. Σήμερον
11 ἐὰν τῆς φωνῆς αὐτοῦ ἀκούσητε, μὴ σκληρύνητε τὰς καρδίας ὑμῶν,
12 ὡς ἐν τῷ παραπικρασμῷ, κατὰ τὴν ἡμέραν τοῦ πειρασμοῦ ἐν τῇ
13 ἐρήμῳ· οὗ ἐπείρασάν με οἱ πατέρες ὑμῶν, ἐδοκίμασάν με, καὶ ἴδον

**PSALM XCIII.**

9 ...shall He not hear? He that formed the eye, shall He not perceive?
10 He that doth discipline nations, shall He not correct them?
   He that doth teach man knowledge,
11 The Lord knoweth the thoughts of men, that they are but vain.
12 Blessed is the man whom Thou dost instruct, O Lord,
   And from Thy law Thou dost teach him;
13 That Thou mayest give him rest from days of evil,
   Until a pit be dug for the unrighteous.
14 For the Lord shall not cast off His people,
15 Neither shall He forsake His inheritance;
   Until righteousness shall turn again unto judgment,
   And all they that are upright in heart shall cleave unto it.
16 Selah. Who shall rise up for me against the workers of iniquity?
17 Or who shall stand with me against them that work unrighteousness?
18 Were it not that the Lord had helped me,
   My soul had almost dwelt in Hades.
19 If I said, "My foot doth slip,"
   Thy mercy, O Lord, did uphold me.
20 According to the multitude of my sorrows in my heart,
   Thy consolations have made my soul to rejoice.
21 Shall the throne of iniquity be associated with Thee,
   Which frameth mischief by a decree?
22 They that hunt the soul of the righteous,
   And condemn the blood of the innocent.
23 But the Lord was made unto me a refuge,
   And my God became the helper of my hope.
24 And He shall repay them (the Lord, according to) their own iniquity,
   And according to their wickedness shall He destroy them;
25 The Lord our God shall destroy them.

**PSALM XCIV.**
A Psalm of a Song by David.

1 O come, let us rejoice in the Lord;
2 Let us make a joyful noise to God our Saviour.
   Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving,
   And let us make a joyful noise unto Him with psalms.
3 For the Lord is a great God,
   And a great King above all gods.
4 For in His hand are the ends of the earth,
   And the heights of the mountains are His also.
5 For the sea is His, and He made it;
   And His hands formed the dry land.
6 O come, let us worship and fall down [before Him],
   And weep before the Lord our Maker.
7 For He is our God, and we are the people of His pasture,
   And the sheep of His hand.
8 To-day if ye will hear His voice,
   Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation,
9 According to the day of temptation in the wilderness;
   Where your fathers did tempt Me, they proved Me, and saw
