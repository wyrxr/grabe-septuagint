**ΚΕΦ. ΚΑ΄. ΚΒ΄. ΙΕΡΕΜΙΑΣ 1249**
**9** προσώπου ὑμῶν τὴν ὁδὸν τῆς ζωῆς, καὶ τὴν ὁδὸν τοῦ θανάτου.
Ὁ καθήμενος ἐν τῇ πόλει ταύτῃ ἀποθανεῖται ἐν μαχαίρᾳ καὶ ἐν
λιμῷ, καὶ ἐν θανάτῳ· καὶ ὁ ἐκπορευόμενος προσχωρῆσαι πρὸς
τοὺς Χαλδαίους τοὺς συγκεκλεικότας ὑμᾶς, ζήσεται, καὶ ἔσται
ἡ ψυχὴ αὐτοῦ εἰς σκῦλα, καὶ ζήσεται.
**10** Διότι ἐστήρισα τὸ πρό-
σωπόν μου ἐπὶ τὴν πόλιν ταύτην εἰς κακά, καὶ οὐκ εἰς ἀγαθὰ
φησὶ Κύριος· εἰς χεῖρας βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος παραδοθήσεται,
καὶ κατακαύσει αὐτὴν ἐν πυρί.
**11** Ὁ οἶκος βασιλέως Ἰούδα, ἀκού-
σατε λόγον Κυρίου, οἶκος Δαυΐδ,
**12** τάδε λέγει Κύριος· κρίνατε
πρωΐ κρῖμα, καὶ κατευθύνατε, καὶ ἐξέλεσθε διηρπασμένον ἐκ χει-
ρὸς ἀδικοῦντος αὐτόν, ὅπως μὴ ἀναφθῇ ὡς πῦρ ἡ ὀργή μου,
καὶ καυθήσεται, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ὁ σβέσων, ἀπὸ προσώπου ἀδι-
κίας τῶν ἐπιτηδευμάτων ὑμῶν.
**13** Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ πρὸς σὲ τὸν κατοικ-
οῦντα τὴν κοιλάδα Σάρ, τὴν πεδινήν, τοὺς λέγοντας, τίς πτο-
ήσει ἡμᾶς; ἢ τίς εἰσελεύσεται πρὸς τὸ κατοικητήριον ἡμῶν;
**14** Καὶ ἐπισκέψομαι ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς κατὰ τὰ πονηρὰ ἐπιτηδεύματα ὑμῶν,
φησὶ Κύριος, καὶ ἀνάψω πῦρ ἐν τῷ δρυμῷ αὐτῆς, καὶ κατέ-
δεται πάντα τὰ κύκλῳ αὐτῆς.

**ΚΕΦ. ΚΒ΄. ΧΧΙΙ.**

**1** ΤΑΔΕ λέγει Κύριος· πορεύου καὶ κατάβηθι εἰς τὸν οἶκον
τοῦ βασιλέως Ἰούδα, καὶ λαλήσεις ἐκεῖ τὸν λόγον τοῦτον,
**2** καὶ ἐρεῖς· ἄκουε λόγον Κυρίου, βασιλεῦ Ἰούδα, ὁ καθή-
μενος ἐπὶ θρόνου Δαυΐδ, σὺ καὶ οἱ παῖδές σου καὶ οἱ παῖδες σου,
καὶ ὁ λαός σου, καὶ οἱ εἰσπορευόμενοι ἐν ταῖς πύλαις ταύταις.
**3** Τάδε
λέγει Κύριος· ποιεῖτε κρίσιν καὶ δικαιοσύνην, καὶ ἐξαιρεῖσθε διηρ-
πασμένον ἐκ χειρὸς ἀδικοῦντος αὐτόν, καὶ προσήλυτον καὶ ὀρ-
φανὸν καὶ χήραν μὴ καταδυναστεύετε, καὶ μὴ ἀσεβεῖτε, καὶ
αἷμα ἀθώον μὴ ἐκχέητε ἐν τῷ τόπῳ τούτῳ.
**4** Διότι ἐὰν ποιοῦν-
τες ποιήσητε τὸν λόγον τοῦτον, καὶ εἰσελεύσονται ἐν ταῖς πύλαις
τοῦ οἴκου τούτου βασιλεῖς καὶ ἄρχοντες, καθήμενοι ἐπὶ θρόνου
Δαυΐδ, καὶ ἐπιβεβηκότες ἐφ᾿ ἁρμάτων καὶ ἵππων, αὐτοὶ καὶ οἱ παῖ-
δες αὐτῶν, καὶ ὁ λαὸς αὐτῶν.
**5** Ἐὰν δὲ μὴ ποιήσητε τοὺς λό-
γους τούτους, κατ᾿ ἐμαυτοῦ ὤμοσα, λέγει Κύριος, ὅτι εἰς
ἐρήμωσιν ἔσται ὁ οἶκος οὗτος.
**6** Ὅτι τάδε λέγει Κύριος

### JEREMIAH 21

**8** [the] way of life, and [the] way of death.
**9** He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by famine, and by pestilence; but he that goeth forth to join the Chaldeans, who have besieged you, he shall live, and his soul shall be as a spoil, and he shall live.
**10** For I have set My face against this city for evil, and not for good, saith the Lord; it shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.
**11** O house of the king of Judah, hear ye the word of the Lord, O house of David!
**12** Thus saith the Lord: Execute judgment in the morning, and make straight [the way], and deliver him that is plundered out of the hand of him that wrongs him; lest My wrath go forth like fire, and burn, and none shall quench it, because of the wickedness of your doings.
**13** Behold, I am against thee, O inhabitant of the Valley of Sar, of the plain, ye who say, 'Who shall disquiet us? Or who shall enter into our habitation?'
**14** And I will visit upon you according to the evil of your doings, saith the Lord, and I will kindle a fire in her forest, and it shall devour all that is round about her.

### JEREMIAH 22

**1** THUS saith the Lord: Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word,
**2** and say, 'Hear the word of the Lord, O king of Judah, that sittest upon the throne of David, thou, and thy servants, and thy servants, and thy people, and they that enter in by these gates.'
**3** Thus saith the Lord: Execute ye judgment and righteousness, and deliver him that is plundered out of the hand of him that wrongs him, and oppress not the stranger, nor the orphan, nor the widow; neither deal ungodly, nor shed innocent blood in this place.
**4** For if ye indeed perform this word, then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings and rulers, sitting upon the throne of David, and riding upon chariots and horses, they, and their servants, and their people.
**5** But if ye will not hearken unto these words, by Myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, that this house shall become a desolation.
**6** For thus saith the Lord
