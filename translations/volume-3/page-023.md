ΨΑΛΤΗΡΙΟΝ.

σωτηρία σου εἰμὶ ἐγώ. Αἰσχυνθήτωσαν καὶ ἐντραπήτωσαν οἱ ζητοῦντες
τὴν ψυχήν μου· ἀποστραφήτωσαν εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω καὶ καταισχυνθήτωσαν
οἱ λογιζόμενοί μοι κακά. Γενηθήτωσαν ὡσεὶ χνοῦς κατὰ πρόσωπον
ἀνέμου, καὶ ἄγγελος Κυρίου ἐκθλίβων αὐτούς. Γενηθήτω ἡ ὁδὸς αὐτῶν
σκότος καὶ ὀλίσθημα, καὶ ἄγγελος Κυρίου καταδιώκων αὐτούς.
Ὅτι δωρεὰν ἔκρυψάν μοι διαφθοράν παγίδος αὐτῶν· μάτην
ὠνείδισαν τὴν ψυχήν μου. Ἐλθάτω αὐτῷ παγίς, ἣν οὐ γινώσκει·
καὶ ἡ θήρα ἣν ἔκρυψε, συλλαβέτω αὐτόν, καὶ ἐν τῇ παγίδι πεσεῖται
ἐν αὐτῇ. Ἡ δὲ ψυχή μου ἀγαλλιάσεται ἐπὶ τῷ Κυρίῳ, τερφθήσεται
ἐπὶ τῷ σωτηρίῳ αὐτοῦ. Πάντα τὰ ὀστᾶ μου ἐροῦσι· Κύριε (Κύριε) τίς
ὅμοιός σοι; · ῥυόμενος πτωχὸν ἐκ στερεωτέρων αὐτοῦ, καὶ πτωχὸν
καὶ πένητα ἀπὸ τῶν διαρπαζόντων αὐτόν. Ἀναστάντες μάρτυρες
ἄδικοι, ἃ οὐκ ἐγίνωσκον, ἠρώτων με. Ἀνταπεδιδόσαν μοι πονηρὰ ἀντὶ
ἀγαθῶν, καὶ ἀτεκνίαν τῇ ψυχῇ μου. Ἐγὼ δὲ ἐν τῷ αὐτοὺς
παρενοχλεῖν μοι, ἐνεδυόμην σάκκον, (καὶ) ἐταπείνουν ἐν νηστείᾳ
τὴν ψυχήν μου, καὶ ἡ προσευχή μου εἰς κόλπον μου ἀποστραφήτω·
ὡς πλησίον, ὡς ἀδελφὸν ἡμέτερον οὕτως εὐηρέστουν· ὡς πενθῶν
καὶ σκυθρωπάζων οὕτως ἐταπεινούμην. Καὶ κατ᾽ ἐμοῦ ηὐφράνθησαν
καὶ συνήχθησαν· συνήχθησαν ἐπ᾽ ἐμὲ μάστιγες, καὶ οὐκ ἔγνων·
διεσχίσθησαν καὶ οὐ κατενύγησαν. Ἐπείρασάν με, ἐξεμυκτήρισάν
με μυκτηρισμόν, ἔβρυξαν ἐπ᾽ ἐμὲ τοὺς ὀδόντας αὐτῶν. Κύριε πότε
ἐπόψῃ; ἀποκατάστησον τὴν ψυχήν μου ἀπὸ τῆς κακουργίας αὐτῶν,
ἀπὸ λεόντων τὴν μονογενῆ μου. Ἐξομολογήσομαί σοι ἐν ἐκκλησίᾳ
πολλῇ, ἐν λαῷ βαρεῖ αἰνέσω σε. Μὴ ἐπιχαρείησάν μοι οἱ ἐχθραίνοντές
μοι ἀδίκως, οἱ μισοῦντές με δωρεάν, καὶ διανεύοντες ὀφθαλμοῖς.
Ὅτι ἐμοὶ μὲν εἰρηνικὰ ἐλάλουν, καὶ ἐπ᾽ ὀργὴν γῆς λαλοῦντες,
δόλους διελογίζοντο καὶ ἐπλάτυναν ἐπ᾽ ἐμὲ τὸ στόμα αὐτῶν, εἶπον·
εὖγε εὖγε, εἶδον οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ ἡμῶν. Εἶδες Κύριε, μὴ παρασιωπήσῃς·
Κύριε μὴ ἀποστῇς ἀπ᾽ ἐμοῦ. Ἐξεγέρθητι (Κύριε), καὶ πρόσχες τῇ
κρίσει μου, ὁ Θεός μου καὶ ὁ Κύριός μου εἰς τὴν δίκην μου. Κρῖνόν
με (Κύριε) κατὰ τὴν δικαιοσύνην σου Κύριε ὁ Θεός μου, καὶ μὴ
ἐπιχαρείησάν μοι. Μὴ εἴποισαν ἐν καρδίαις αὐτῶν, εὖγε εὖγε τῇ
ψυχῇ ἡμῶν· μηδὲ εἴποισαν, κατεπίομεν αὐτόν. Αἰσχυνθήτωσαν καὶ
ἐντραπείησαν ἅμα οἱ ἐπιχαίροντες τοῖς κακοῖς μου· ἐνδυσάσθωσαν
αἰσχύνην καὶ ἐντροπὴν οἱ μεγαλορημονοῦντες ἐπ᾽ ἐμέ.

**PSALM XXXIV.**

3 "I am thy salvation."
Let them be confounded and put to shame who seek my soul;
Let them be turned backward and brought to dishonour who devise evils against me.
4 Let them be as dust before the face of the wind,
And let the Angel of the Lord afflict them.
Let their way be darkness and a slippery path,
And let the Angel of the Lord pursue them.
5 For without cause they hid for me the pit of their snare;
Vainly did they revile my soul.
6 Let a snare come upon him, which he knoweth not;
And let the prey which he hid, catch him;
And in that very snare let him fall.
7 But my soul shall greatly rejoice in the Lord;
It shall delight in His salvation.
8 All my bones shall say, "Lord, [O] Lord, who is like unto Thee?"
Who delivereth the poor from those that are stronger than he,
And the poor and needy from those that plunder him.
9 Unjust witnesses rose up;
They questioned me concerning things I knew not.
10 They rendered unto me evil for good,
And desolation unto my soul.
11 But I, when they did trouble me, clothed myself in sackcloth;
(And) I humbled my soul with fasting,
And let my prayer return unto my bosom.
12 As for a neighbour, as for our brother, so did I deal kindly;
As one mourning and sorrowing, so was I humbled.
13 And against me they rejoiced and gathered together;
Scourges gathered upon me, and I knew it not.
They were rent asunder, yet were not pricked [in heart].
14 They tempted me; they mocked me with utter mockery;
They gnashed their teeth upon me.
15 Lord, when wilt Thou behold [me]?
Restore my soul from their evil-doing,
My only-beloved from the lions.
16 I will confess Thee in a great congregation;
I will praise Thee among a mighty people.
17 Let not them that are my adversaries rejoice over me unrighteously,
Them that hate me without cause,
And wink with their eyes.
18 For though they spoke peaceable things unto me,
Yet speaking to the wrath of the earth, they devised deceits.
19 And they opened wide their mouth against me, saying:
"Aha, aha! Our eyes have seen!"
20 Thou hast seen, O Lord; be not silent.
O Lord, depart not from me.
21 Awake (O Lord), and attend unto my judgment,
My God and my Lord, unto my plea.
22 Judge me (O Lord) according to Thy righteousness, O Lord my God;
And let them not rejoice over me.
23 Let them not say in their hearts, "Aha, aha, [it is] to our soul!"
Nor let them say, "We have swallowed him up!"
24 Let them be ashamed and confounded together,
They that rejoice at my evils;
Let them be clothed with shame and dishonour,
They that speak boastfully against me.
