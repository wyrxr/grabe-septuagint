4 εὐθείας ποιεῖτε τὰς τρίβους τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν. Πᾶσα φάραγξ πληρωθήσεται, καὶ πᾶν ὄρος καὶ βουνὸς ταπεινωθήσεται· καὶ
5 ἔσται τὰ σκολιὰ εἰς εὐθεῖαν, καὶ ἡ τραχεῖα εἰς πεδία, καὶ ὀφθήσεται ἡ δόξα Κυρίου, καὶ ὄψεται πᾶσα σὰρξ τὸ σωτήριον τοῦ Θεοῦ, ὅτι Κύριος ἐλάλησε.
6 Φωνὴ λέγοντος, βόησον· καὶ εἶπα· τί βοήσω ; πᾶσα σὰρξ χόρτος, καὶ πᾶσα δόξα ἀνθρώπου,
7 ὡς ἄνθος χόρτος. Ἐξηράνθη ὁ χόρτος, καὶ τὸ ἄνθος ἐξέπεσεν, ὅτι πνεῦμα Κυρίου ἔπνευσεν εἰς αὐτό· ἀληθῶς χόρτος ὁ λαός·
8 ἐξηράνθη χόρτος, ἐξέπεσε τὸ ἄνθος· τὸ δὲ ῥῆμα τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν μένει εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα.
9 Ἐπ᾽ ὄρος ὑψηλὸν ἀνάβηθι, ὁ εὐαγγελίζομενος Σιών, ὕψωσον τῇ ἰσχύϊ τὴν φωνήν σου, ὁ εὐαγγελίζομενος Ἱερουσαλήμ· ὑψώσατε, μὴ φοβεῖσθε· εἰπὸν ταῖς
10 πόλεσιν Ἰούδα· ἰδοὺ ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν, ἰδοὺ Κύριος Κύριος μετὰ ἰσχύος ἔρχεται, καὶ ὁ βραχίων αὐτοῦ μετὰ κυρίας, ἰδοὺ ὁ μισθὸς αὐτοῦ μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὸ ἔργον ἑκάστου ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ.
11 Ὡς ποιμὴν ποιμανεῖ τὸ ποίμνιον αὐτοῦ, καὶ τῷ βραχίονι αὐτοῦ συνάξει ἄρνας, καὶ ἐν τῷ κόλπῳ αὐτοῦ βαστάσει· ἐν
12 γαστρὶ ἐχούσας παρακαλέσει. Τίς ἐμέτρησε τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ τὸ ὕδωρ, καὶ τὸν οὐρανὸν σπιθαμῇ, καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν δρακί;
13 τίς ἔστησε τὰ ὄρη σταθμῷ, καὶ τὰς νάπας ζυγῷ ; Τίς ἔγνω νοῦν Κυρίου, καὶ τίς σύμβουλος αὐτοῦ ἐγένετο, ὃς συμβιβάσει
14 αὐτόν; Ἢ πρὸς τίνα συνεβουλεύσατο, καὶ συνεβίβασεν αὐτόν; ἢ τίς ἔδειξεν αὐτῷ κρίσιν; ἢ ὁδὸν συνέσεως τίς ἔδειξεν αὐτῷ;
15 ἢ τίς προέδωκεν αὐτῷ, καὶ ἀνταπεδοθήσεται αὐτῷ; Εἰ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη ὡς σταγὼν ἀπὸ κάδου, καὶ ὡς ῥοπὴ ζυγοῦ ἐλογίσθησαν,
16 καὶ ὡς σίελος λογισθήσονται; Ὁ δὲ Λίβανος οὐχ ἱκανὸς εἰς καῦσιν, καὶ πάντα τὰ τετράποδα οὐχ ἱκανὰ εἰς ὁλοκάρπωσιν,
17 καὶ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη ὡς οὐδέν εἰσι, καὶ εἰς οὐδὲν ἐλογίσθησαν αὐτῷ.
18 Τίνι ὡμοιώσατε Κύριον, καὶ τίνι ὁμοιώματι ὡμοιώσατε αὐτόν;
19 Μὴ εἰκόνα ἐποίησε τέκτων ἢ χρυσοχόος χωνεύσας χρυσίον περιεχρύσωσεν αὐτόν; ὁμοίωμα κατεσκεύασεν αὐτόν;
20 Ξύλον γὰρ ἄσηπτον ἐκλέγεται τέκτων, καὶ σοφῶς ζητήσει πῶς στήσει αὐτοῦ εἰκόνα, καὶ ἵνα μὴ σαλεύηται.
21 Οὐ γνώσεσθε; οὐκ ἀκούσεσθε; οὐκ ἀνηγγέλη ἐξ ἀρχῆς ὑμῖν;
22 οὐκ ἔγνωτε τὰ θεμέλια τῆς γῆς; Ὁ κατέχων τὸν γῦρον τῆς γῆς· καὶ οἱ ἐνοικοῦντες ἐν αὐτῇ ὡς ἀκρίδες· ὁ στήσας ὡς καμάραν τὸν οὐρανόν, καὶ διατείνας αὐτὸν ὡς σκηνὴν κατοικεῖν,
23 ὁ διδούς ἄρχοντας εἰς οὐδὲν ἄρχειν, τὴν δὲ γῆν ὡς οὐδὲν ἐποίησεν.
24 Οὐ γὰρ μὴ σπείρωσιν, οὐδὲ μὴ φυτεύσωσιν, οὐδὲ μὴ ῥιζωθῇ εἰς τὴν γῆν ἡ ῥίζα αὐτῶν· ἔπνευσεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς, καὶ ἐξηράνθησαν, καὶ καταιγὶς ὡς φρύγανα ἀναλήψεται αὐτούς.
25 Νῦν οὖν τίνι με ὡμοιώσατε, καὶ ὑψωθήσομαι ; εἶπεν ὁ ἅγιος,
26 Ἀναβλέψατε εἰς τὸ ὕψος τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς ὑμῶν, καὶ ἴδετε, τίς κατέδειξε πάντα ταῦτα; ὁ ἐκφέρων κατὰ ἀριθμὸν τὸν κόσμον αὐτοῦ, πάντα ἐπ᾿ ὀνόματι καλέσει ἀπὸ τῆς πολλῆς δόξης, καὶ ἐν κράτει ἰσχύος οὐδὲν σε ἔλαβε.
27 Μὴ γὰρ εἴπῃς Ἰακώβ, καὶ τί ἐλάλησας Ἰσραήλ; ἀπεκρύβη ἡ ὁδός μου ἀπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ ὁ Θεός μου τὴν κρίσιν μου ἀφεῖλε, καὶ ἀπέστη.
28 Καὶ νῦν οὐκ ἔγνως; εἰ μὴ ἤκουσας; Θεὸς αἰώνιος, Θεὸς ὁ κατασκευάσας τὰ ἄκρα τῆς γῆς, οὐ πεινάσει, οὐδὲ κοπιάσει,
29 οὐδὲ ἔστιν ἐξεύρεσις τῆς φρονήσεως αὐτοῦ, διδοὺς τοῖς πεινῶσιν ἰσχὺν, καὶ τοῖς μὴ ὀδυνωμένοις λύπην.
30 Πεινάσουσι γὰρ νεώτεροι, καὶ κοπιάσουσι νεανίσκοι, καὶ ἔκλεκτοι ἀνίσχυες ἔσονται.
31 Οἱ δὲ ὑπομένοντες τὸν Θεὸν ἀλλάξουσιν ἰσχὺν, πτεροφυήσουσιν ὡς ἀετοὶ, δραμοῦνται καὶ οὐ κοπιάσουσι, βαδιοῦνται καὶ οὐ πεινάσουσιν.

#### Chapter 40

**4** make straight the paths of our God. Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low;
**5** and the crooked places shall be made straight, and the rough places into plains: and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see the salvation of God; for the Lord hath spoken [it].
**6** A voice of one saying, "Cry aloud!" And I said, "What shall I cry?" All flesh is grass, and all the glory of man
**7** is as the flower of grass. The grass withered, and the flower faded, because the Spirit of the Lord breathed upon it; verily, the people are grass.
**8** The grass withered, the flower faded; but the word of our God abideth for ever.
**9** O thou that bringest good tidings to Zion, get thee up upon a high mountain! Lift up thy voice with strength, O thou that bringest good tidings to Jerusalem! Lift it up, fear ye not; say unto the
**10** cities of Judah, "Behold your God! Behold, the Lord, even the Lord, cometh with strength, and His arm [cometh] with dominion; behold, His recompense [is] with Him, and the work of every man [is] before Him."
**11** Like a shepherd shall He feed His flock; with His arm shall He gather the lambs, and carry them in His bosom; [and them that are] with
**12** young in belly shall He comfort. Who hath measured the water in His hand, and the heaven with a span, and all the earth with a handful?
**13** Who hath set the mountains by measure, and the glens by a balance? Who hath known the mind of the Lord? And who became His counselor, who shall instruct
**14** Him? Or with whom did He take counsel, and who did instruct Him? Or who showed Him judgment? Or who showed Him the way of understanding?
**15** Or who hath given to Him beforehand, and it shall be recompensed unto Him? Behold, all the nations are as a drop from a bucket, and as the dust of a balance, so they are reckoned,
**16** and as spittle shall they be reckoned? Even Lebanon is not sufficient for burning, nor all the four-footed beasts thereof sufficient for a whole burnt offering,
**17** and all the nations are as nothing, and they were reckoned unto Him as nothing.
**18** To whom then have ye likened the Lord, and to what similitude have ye likened Him?
**19** Hath a craftsman made an image, or a goldsmith, having melted gold, covered it with gold? A graven image hath he fashioned for him?
**20** For a craftsman chooseth a wood that will not rot, and seeketh wisely how he shall set up his image, so that it be not moved.
**21** Do ye not know? Do ye not hear? Was it not declared unto you from the beginning?
**22** Have ye not known the foundations of the earth? [It is He] who holdeth the circle of the earth; and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; who hath established the heaven as a vault, and stretched it out as a tent to dwell in;
**23** He is the Giver of rulers to rule for naught, and He hath made the earth as nothing.
**24** For they shall not sow, neither shall they plant, neither shall their root strike deep into the earth; He hath breathed upon them, and they are withered, and a tempest shall take them away as stubble.
**25** To whom then have ye likened Me, and I shall be exalted? saith the Holy One.
**26** Lift up your eyes on high, and see: Who hath shown all these things? He that bringeth forth His host by number, He shall call all by name, from the greatness of His glory, and in the might of His strength, nothing hath taken thee.
**27** For say not, O Jacob, and what hast thou spoken, O Israel: "My way is hidden from God, and my God hath taken away my judgment, and hath departed."
**28** Knowest thou not now? Hast thou not heard? The eternal God, even the God who fashioned the ends of the earth, neither shall He hunger, nor shall He toil,
**29** neither is there any searching out of His understanding; giving strength unto the hungry, and sorrow unto those who suffer not.
**30** For the younger shall hunger, and the young men shall toil, and the chosen ones shall be without strength.
**31** But they that wait upon God shall renew their strength; they shall grow wings as eagles; they shall run, and not toil; they shall walk, and not hunger.
