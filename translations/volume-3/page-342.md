εἰς ἣν ἀπῴκισα ὑμᾶς ἐκεῖ· καὶ προσεύχεσθε περὶ αὐτῶν πρὸς 8
Κύριον, ὅτι ἐν τῇ εἰρήνῃ αὐτῆς ἔσται ἡ εἰρήνη ὑμῖν. ῞Οτι οὕτως
εἶπε Κύριος τῶν δυνάμεων ὁ Θεὸς ᾿Ισραήλ· μὴ ἀναπειθέτωσαν
ὑμᾶς οἱ ψευδοπροφῆται οἱ ἐν ὑμῖν, καὶ μὴ ἀναπειθέτωσαν ὑμᾶς οἱ
μάντεις ὑμῶν, καὶ μὴ ἀκούετε εἰς τὰ ἐνύπνια ὑμῶν, ἃ ὑμεῖς ἐνυπνιά-
ζεσθε, ὅτι ἄδικα αὐτοὶ προφητεύουσιν ὑμῖν ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί μου,
10 καὶ οὐκ ἀπέστειλα αὐτούς, φησὶ Κύριος. ῞Οτι οὕτως εἶπε Κύ-
ριος· ὅταν μέλλῃ πληροῦσθαι Βαβυλῶνι ἑβδομήκοντα ἔτη, ἐπι-
σκέψομαι ὑμᾶς, καὶ ἐπιστήσω τοὺς λόγους μου τοὺς ἀγαθοὺς ἐφ᾿
ὑμᾶς, τοῦ ἀποστρέψαι τὸν λαὸν ὑμῶν εἰς τὸν τόπον τοῦτον.
11 ῞Οτι ἐγὼ οἶδα τὸν λογισμόν, ὃν ἐγὼ λογιοῦμαι ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς, φησὶ
Κύριος, λογισμὸν εἰρήνης, καὶ οὐ κακά, τοῦ δοῦναι ὑμῖν τὰ μετὰ
12 ταῦτα καὶ ἐλπίδα· καὶ ἐπικαλέσεσθέ με, καὶ πορεύσεσθε, καὶ προ-
σεύξασθε πρὸς μέ, καὶ εἰσακούσομαι ὑμῶν. Καὶ ἐκζητήσετε με
14 καὶ εὑρήσετέ με· ὅταν ζητήσετέ με ἐν ὅλῃ καρδίᾳ ὑμῶν, καὶ
ἐπιφανοῦμαι ὑμῖν, φησὶ Κύριος, καὶ ἐπιστρέψω τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν
ὑμῶν, καὶ ἀθροίσω ὑμᾶς ἐκ πάντων τῶν ἐθνῶν, καὶ ἐκ πάντων
τῶν τόπων, οὗ διέσπειρα ὑμᾶς ἐκεῖ, φησὶ Κύριος· καὶ ἐπιστρέψω
16 ὑμᾶς εἰς τὸν τόπον, ὅθεν ἀπῴκισα ὑμᾶς ἐκεῖ. ῞Οτι τάδε λέγει
Κύριος πρὸς τὸν καθήμενον ἐπὶ θρόνου Δαβίδ, καὶ ἐπὶ πάντας
τοὺς λαοὺς τοὺς κατοικοῦντας ἐν τῇ πόλει ταύτῃ, ἀδελφοὺς ὑ-
17 μῶν, μὴ ἐξελθόντας μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν ἐν τῇ ἀποικίᾳ. Τάδε λέγει Κύ-
ριος τῶν δυνάμεων, ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐξαποστελῶ εἰς αὐτοὺς τὴν μά-
χαιραν, τὸν λιμόν, καὶ τὸν θάνατον, καὶ δώσω αὐτοὺς ὥσπερ τὰ
18 σῦκα τὰ σουαρεῖμ, ἃ οὐ βρωθῶσιν ὑπὸ πονηρίας. Καὶ διώξω ὀ-
πίσω αὐτῶν ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ, καὶ ἐν λιμῷ, καὶ ἐν θανάτῳ, καὶ δώσω
αὐτοὺς εἰς σάλον πάσαις βασιλείαις τῆς γῆς, εἰς ὅρκον, καὶ
εἰς ἀφανισμόν, καὶ εἰς συρισμόν, καὶ εἰς ὄνειδος ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς
19 ἔθνεσιν, οὗ διέσπειρα αὐτοὺς ἐκεῖ. ᾿Ανθ᾿ ὧν ὅτι οὐκ ἤκουσαν τῶν
λόγων μου, φησὶ Κύριος, ὅτι ἀπέστειλα πρὸς αὐτοὺς τοὺς δού-
λους μου προφήτας, ὀρθρίζων καὶ ἀποστέλλων, καὶ οὐκ ἠκούσατε,
20 φησὶ Κύριος. Καὶ ὑμεῖς ἀκούσατε λόγον Κυρίου, πᾶσα ἀποικία,
18 ἣν ἐξαπέστειλα ἐξ ῾Ιερουσαλὴμ εἰς Βαβυλῶνα. ῞Οτι εἴπατε, κα-
21 τέστησεν ὑμῖν Κύριος προφήτας ἐν Βαβυλῶνι· οὕτως εἶπε Κύ-
ριος τῶν δυνάμεων ὁ Θεὸς ᾿Ισραὴλ ἐπὶ ᾿Αχιὰβ υἱὸν Κωλαίου, καὶ
ἐπὶ Σεδεκίαν υἱὸν Μαχσίου, τοὺς προφητεύοντας ὑμῖν τῷ ὀνό-

**Jeremiah Chapter 36**

**7** ...wherein I have caused you to be carried away captive; and pray ye for them unto the Lord, for in her peace shall your peace be.
**8** For thus saith the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel: Let not the false prophets who are among you deceive you, neither let your diviners beguile you, neither hearken ye unto your dreams, which ye yourselves do dream;
**9** For falsely do they prophesy unto you in My name, and I have not sent them, saith the Lord.
**10** For thus saith the Lord: When seventy years for Babylon shall be accomplished, I will visit you, and I will establish My good words upon you, to turn again your people unto this place.
**11** For I know the thoughts that I think concerning you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you a future and a hope.
**12** And ye shall call upon Me, and ye shall go and pray unto Me, and I will hearken unto you. And ye shall seek Me
**14** and find Me; when ye shall seek Me with all your heart, then will I manifest Myself unto you, saith the Lord. And I will turn again your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places whither I have scattered you there, saith the Lord. And I will bring you back unto the place from whence I have caused you to be carried away captive there.
**16** For thus saith the Lord concerning him that sitteth upon the throne of David, and concerning all the people that dwell in this city—even your brethren who went not forth with you into the captivity:
**17** Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, "Behold, I will send forth upon them the sword, the famine, and the death; and I will give them as the suareim figs, which cannot be eaten for their rottenness.
**18** And I will pursue after them with the sword, and with the famine, and with the death; and I will make them a terror unto all the kingdoms of the earth, for a curse, and for destruction, and for a hissing, and for a reproach among all the nations whither I have scattered them there.
**19** Because of this, that they hearkened not unto My words, saith the Lord—for I have sent unto them My servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, yet ye have not hearkened," saith the Lord.
**20** "Hear ye, therefore, the word of the Lord, all ye exiles, whom I have sent forth from Jerusalem into Babylon.
**21** Because ye have said, 'The Lord hath raised up prophets for us in Babylon': Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and concerning Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy unto you falsely in My Name:"
