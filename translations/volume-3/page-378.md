ΘΡΗΝΟΙ.
ΚΕΦΑΛΑΙΟΝ Α΄. I.
ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο μετὰ τὸ αἰχμαλωτισθῆναι τὸν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ Ἱε-
ρουσαλὴμ ἐρημωθῆναι, ἐκάθισεν Ἱερεμίας κλαίων, καὶ ἐθρήνησε
τὸν θρῆνον τοῦτον ἐπὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ εἶπεν·
῎Αλεφ.
1 Πῶς ἐκάθισε μόνη ἡ πόλις ἡ πεπληθυμμένη λαῶν; ἐγενήθη ὡς
χήρα πεπληθυμμένη ἐν ἔθνεσιν, ἄρχουσα ἐν χώραις ἐγενήθη εἰς
φόρον.
Βήθ.
2 Κλαίουσα ἐδάκρυσεν ἐν νυκτί, καὶ τὰ δάκρυα αὐτῆς ἐπὶ τῶν
σιαγόνων αὐτῆς, καὶ οὐχ ὑπάρχει ὁ παρακαλῶν αὐτὴν ἀπὸ
πάντων τῶν ἀγαπώντων αὐτήν· πάντες οἱ φιλοῦντες αὐτὴν
ἠθέτησαν ἐν αὐτῇ, ἐγένοντο αὐτῇ εἰς ἐχθρούς.
Γίμελ.
3 Μετωκίσθη ἡ Ἰουδαία ἀπὸ ταπεινώσεως αὐτῆς, καὶ ἀπὸ πλή-
θους δουλείας αὐτῆς· ἐκάθισεν ἐν ἔθνεσιν, οὐχ εὗρεν ἀνάπαυσιν·
πάντες οἱ καταδιώκοντες αὐτήν, κατέλαβον αὐτὴν ἀναμέσον
τῶν θλιβόντων αὐτήν.
Δάλεθ.
4 Ὁδοὶ Σιὼν πενθοῦσι παρὰ τὸ μὴ εἶναι ἐρχομένους ἐν ἑορτῇ,
πᾶσαι αἱ πύλαι αὐτῆς ἠφανισμέναι, οἱ ἱερεῖς αὐτῆς ἀναστε-
νάζουσιν, αἱ παρθένοι αὐτῆς ἀγόμεναι, καὶ αὐτὴ πικραινομένα
ἐν αὐτῇ.
Ἤ.
5 Ἐγένοντο οἱ θλίβοντες αὐτὴν εἰς κεφαλήν, καὶ οἱ ἐχθροὶ αὐτῆς
εὐθηνοῦσαν, ὅτι Κύριος ἐταπείνωσεν αὐτὴν ἐπὶ τὸ πλῆθος τῶν
ἀσεβειῶν αὐτῆς· τὰ νήπια αὐτῆς ἐπορεύθησαν ἐν αἰχμαλωσίᾳ
κατὰ πρόσωπον θλίβοντος.
Οὐαῦ.

**LAMENTATIONS**
**CHAPTER 1**

And it came to pass, after Israel was led captive, and Jerusalem was made desolate, that Jeremiah sat weeping, and lamented this lamentation over Jerusalem, and said:

**Aleph.**
**1** How doth the city sit solitary, she that was full of peoples! She is become as a widow, [even she that was] populous among the nations; [she that was] a princess among the provinces is become tributary.

**2** Weeping, she weepeth in the night, and her tears [are] upon her cheeks; and there is none to comfort her among all them that loved her. All they that loved her have dealt treacherously with her; they are become her enemies.

**Gimel.**
**3** Judah is gone into captivity because of her affliction, and because of the greatness of her servitude; she dwelleth among the nations, [and] hath found no rest. All her persecutors overtook her in the midst of them that afflicted her.

**Daleth.**
**4** The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feast; all her gates are desolate. Her priests sigh, her virgins are led away, and she herself is embittered within her.

**He.**
**5** Her adversaries are become chief, and her enemies [are] prosperous; because the Lord hath afflicted her for the multitude of her impieties. Her infants are gone into captivity before the face of the oppressor.

**Vau.**
**6** And from the daughter of Zion is gone forth all her comeliness;
