9 γνῶναι ἐν τῷ βιβλίῳ τοὺς λόγους Κυρίου ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου. Καὶ
ἐγενήθη ἐν τῷ ἔτει τῷ πέμπτῳ Ἰωακεὶμ υἱῷ Ἰωσίου βασιλεῖ
Ἰούδα ἐν τῷ μηνὶ τῷ ἐνάτῳ, ἐξεκκλησίασαν νηστείαν κατὰ
πρόσωπον Κυρίου πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς
10 οἱ ἐρχόμενοι ἐκ πόλεων Ἰούδα εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ ἀνεγίνωσκε
Βαροὺχ ἐν τῷ βιβλίῳ τοὺς λόγους Ἱερεμίου ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου,
ἐν οἴκῳ Γαμαρίου, υἱοῦ Σαφὰν τοῦ γραμματέως, ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ
τῇ ἐπάνω ἐν προθύροις πύλης οἴκου Κυρίου τῆς καινῆς ἐν ὠσὶ
11 παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ. Καὶ ἤκουσε Μιχαίας υἱὸς Γαμαρίου υἱοῦ Σαφὰν
πάντας τοὺς λόγους Κυρίου ἐκ τοῦ βιβλίου. Καὶ κατέβη εἰς
οἶκον τοῦ βασιλέως, εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ γραμματέως, καὶ ἰδοὺ
ἐκεῖ πάντες οἱ ἄρχοντες ἐκάθηντο, Ἐλισαμὰ ὁ γραμματεὺς,
καὶ Δαλαίας υἱὸς Σελεμίου, καὶ Νάθαν υἱὸς Ἀχοβὼρ, καὶ Γαμαρίας
υἱὸς Σαφὰν, καὶ Σεδεκίας υἱὸς Ἀνανίου, καὶ πάντες οἱ
13 ἄρχοντες, καὶ ἀνήγγειλεν αὐτοῖς Μιχαίας πάντας τοὺς λόγους
οὓς ἤκουσεν ἀναγινώσκοντος τοῦ Βαροὺχ ἐν τῷ βιβλίῳ εἰς τὰ
14 ὦτα τοῦ λαοῦ. Καὶ ἀπέστειλαν πάντες οἱ ἄρχοντες πρὸς Βαροὺχ
υἱὸν Νηρίου τὸν Ἰουδεὶ υἱὸν Ναθανίου, υἱοῦ Σαλαμίου,
υἱοῦ Χουσὶ, λέγοντες· τὸ χαρτίον ἐν ᾧ ἀναγινώσκεις ἐν αὐτῷ
ἐν ὠσὶ τοῦ λαοῦ, λάβε αὐτὸ εἰς τὴν χεῖρά σου, καὶ ἧκε· καὶ
ἔλαβε Βαροὺχ υἱὸς Νηρίου τὸ χαρτίον ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ κατέβη
15 πρὸς αὐτούς. Καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῷ· πάλιν ἀνάγνωθι εἰς τὰ ὦτα
16 ἡμῶν· καὶ ἀνέγνω Βαροὺχ εἰς τὰ ὦτα αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐγενήθη ὡς
ἤκουσαν πάντας τοὺς λόγους, συνεβουλεύσαντο ἕκαστος πρὸς τὸν
πλησίον αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς Βαροὺχ· ἀναγγέλλοντες ἀναγγέλωμεν
17 τῷ βασιλεῖ πάντας τοὺς λόγους τούτους. Καὶ τὸν Βαροὺχ
ἠρώτησαν, λέγοντες· ἀνάγγειλον ἡμῖν, ποῦ ἔγραψας πάντας
18 τοὺς λόγους τούτους; Καὶ εἶπε Βαροὺχ· ἀπὸ στόματος
αὐτοῦ ἀνήγγειλέ μοι Ἱερεμίας πάντας τοὺς λόγους τούτους, κἀγὼ
19 ἔγραφον ἐν βιβλίῳ ἐν μέλανι. Καὶ εἶπαν οἱ ἄρχοντες πρὸς
Βαροὺχ· βάδισον καὶ κρύβηθι σὺ καὶ Ἱερεμίας, καὶ ἄνθρωπος
20 μὴ γνῷ ποῦ ὑμεῖς. Καὶ εἰσῆλθον πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα εἰς τὴν
αὐλὴν, καὶ τὸ χαρτίον ἔδωκαν φυλάσσειν ἐν οἴκῳ Ἐλισαμὰ τοῦ
γραμματέως· καὶ ἀνήγγειλαν τῷ βασιλεῖ πάντας τοὺς λόγους
21 τούτους. Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τὸν Ἰουδεὶν, λαβεῖν τὸ
χαρτίον· καὶ ἔλαβεν αὐτὸ ἐξ οἴκου Ἐλισαμὰ τοῦ γραμματέως.

**JEREMIAH 43 (Septuagint) / JEREMIAH 36 (Hebrew)**

**9** to discern the words of the Lord in the book within the house of the Lord. And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, that all the people in Jerusalem, and all the people who came forth out of the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem, proclaimed a fast before the Lord.
**10** Then Baruch did read from the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the Lord, in the chamber of Gamariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the upper court, at the entry of the new gate of the House of the Lord, in the ears of all the people.
**11** And Micaiah the son of Gamariah, the son of Shaphan, heard all the words of the Lord out of the book.
**12** Then he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber; and, behold, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shelemiah, and Nathan the son of Achbor, and Gamariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah; yea, all the princes.
**13** And Micaiah declared unto them all the words which he had heard, when Baruch read from the book in the ears of the people.
**14** So all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch the son of Neriah, saying, "Take in thine hand the scroll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come." And Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand, and went down unto them.
**15** And they said unto him, "Read it again in our ears." So Baruch read it in their ears.
**16** Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, that they counselled one with another, and said unto Baruch, "We must surely declare all these words unto the king."
**17** Then they asked Baruch, saying, "Tell us, we pray thee, where didst thou write all these words?"
**18** And Baruch answered them, "From his mouth did Jeremiah declare unto me all these words, and I did write them in the book with ink."
**19** Then said the princes unto Baruch, "Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye be."
**20** And they went in to the king into the court, having laid up the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe; and they declared unto the king all these words.
**21** So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the scroll; and he fetched it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe.
