YMN. Α΄.
9 Ὕδατα, ἐπάγη τὰ κύματα ἐν μέσῳ τῆς θαλάσσης. Εἶπεν ὁ ἐχθρός·
διώξας καταλήψομαι, μεριῶ σκῦλα, ἐμπλήσω ψυχήν μου, ἀνελῶ
10 τῇ μαχαίρᾳ μου, κυριεύσει ἡ χείρ μου. Ἀπέστειλας τὸ πνεῦμά
σου, (καὶ) ἐκάλυψεν αὐτοὺς θάλασσα· ἔδυσαν ὡσεὶ μόλιβος ἐν ὕδατι
11 σφοδρῷ. Τίς ὅμοιός σοι ἐν θεοῖς Κύριε; τίς ὅμοιός σοι; δεδο-
12 ξασμένος ἐν ἁγίοις, θαυμαστὸς ἐν δόξαις, ποιῶν τέρατα. Ἐξέτεινας
13 τὴν δεξιάν σου, καὶ κατέπιεν αὐτοὺς ἡ γῆ. Ὁδήγησας ἐν
τῇ δικαιοσύνῃ σου τὸν λαόν σου τοῦτον, ἐν ἐλυτρώσῳ παρεκάλε-
σας ἐν τῇ ἰσχύϊ σου εἰς κατάλυμα ἅγιόν σου. Ἤκουσαν ἔθνη, καὶ
14 ἐφοβήθησαν· ὠδῖνες ἔλαβον κατοικοῦντας Φυλιστιείμ. Τότε ἔσπευ-
15 σαν ἡγεμόνες Ἐδώμ, καὶ ἄρχοντες Μωαβιτῶν, ἔλαβεν αὐτοὺς τρό-
μος· ἐτάκησαν πάντες οἱ κατοικοῦντες Χαναάν. Ἐπιπέσοι ἐπ᾿ αὐ-
16 τοὺς φόβος καὶ τρόμος· μεγέθει βραχίονός σου ἀπολιθωθήτωσαν,
ἕως ἂν παρέλθῃ ὁ λαός σου Κύριε, ἕως ἂν παρέλθῃ ὁ λαός σου οὗτος,
ὃν ἐκτήσω. Εἰσαγαγὼν καταφύτευσον αὐτοὺς εἰς ὄρος κλη-
17 ρονομίας σου, εἰς ἕτοιμον κατοικητήριόν σου, ὃ κατειργάσω Κύ-
18 ριε, ἁγίασμα Κύριε, ὃ ἡτοίμασαν αἱ χεῖρές σου. Κύριος βασιλεύων
19 τῶν αἰώνων, καὶ ἐπ᾿ αἰῶνα, καὶ ἔτι. Ὅτι εἰσῆλθεν ἵππος
Φαραὼ σὺν ἅρμασι καὶ ἀναβάταις αὐτοῦ εἰς θάλασσαν, καὶ ἐπήγαγεν
ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς Κύριος τὸ ὕδωρ τῆς θαλάσσης· οἱ δὲ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐπορεύθησαν διὰ ξηρᾶς ἐν μέσῳ τῆς θαλάσσης.

YMN. Β΄. II.

1 ὨΔΗ Μωϋσέως ἐν τῷ Δευτερονομίῳ. Πρόσεχε οὐρανέ, καὶ
2 λαλήσω, καὶ ἀκουέτω γῆ ῥήματα ἐκ στόματός μου. Προσδοκάσθω
ὡς ὑετὸς τὸ ἀπόφθεγμά μου, καὶ καταβήτω ὡς δρόσος τὰ
ῥήματά μου, ὡσεὶ ὄμβρος ἐπ᾿ ἀγρωσιν, καὶ ὡσεὶ νιφετὸς ἐπὶ χόρτον.
3 Ὅτι ὄνομα Κυρίου ἐκάλεσα· δότε μεγαλωσύνην τῷ Θεῷ
4 ἡμῶν. Θεὸς ἀληθινὰ τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ, καὶ πᾶσαι αἱ ὁδοὶ αὐτοῦ
κρίσις· Θεὸς πιστὸς, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἀδικία· δίκαιος καὶ ὅσιος Κύριος.
5 Ἡμάρτοσαν, οὐκ αὐτῷ τέκνα μωμητά· γενεὰ σκολιὰ καὶ
διεστραμμένη. Ταῦτα Κυρίῳ ἀνταποδίδοτε, οὕτω λαὸς μωρὸς καὶ
6 οὐχὶ σοφός; οὐκ αὐτός οὗτος σου πατὴρ ἐκτήσατό σε, καὶ ἐποίησέ
σε, καὶ ἔκτισέ σε; Μνήσθητε ἡμέρας αἰῶνος, σύνετε ἔτη γενεὰς
7 γενεῶν· ἐπερώτησον τὸν πατέρα σου, καὶ ἀναγγελεῖ σοι, τοὺς

**The First Ode [continued]: The Song of Moses in the Exodus.**
**9** The waters, the waves did stand congealed in the midst of the sea.
    The enemy spake, "I shall pursue, I shall overtake, I shall divide the spoil;
    my soul shall be filled, I shall draw forth
**10** my sword, my hand shall surely possess [them]."
    Thou didst send forth Thy spirit, (and) the sea covered them;
    they sank as lead in mighty waters.
**11** Who is like unto Thee among the gods, O Lord?
    Who is like unto Thee,
**12** glorified among the saints,
    awesome in praises, doing wonders?
**13** Thou didst stretch forth Thy right hand, and the earth did swallow them.
    Thou didst guide in Thy righteousness this Thy people;
    by [Thine act of] redemption, Thou didst sustain [them] by Thy strength
    unto Thy holy habitation.
**14** The nations heard, and they were afraid;
    pangs took hold of them that dwell in Philistia.
**15** Then did the chieftains of Edom make haste,
    and the princes of the Moabites; trembling did seize them.
    All the inhabitants of Canaan did melt away.
**16** Let fear and trembling fall upon them;
    by the greatness of Thine arm let them become as stone,
    until Thy people, O Lord, shall pass over;
    until this Thy people shall pass over, whom Thou hast acquired.
**17** Bringing [them] in, plant them upon the mountain of Thine inheritance,
    into Thy prepared habitation, which Thou, O Lord, hast wrought,
**18** Thy sanctuary, O Lord, which Thy hands have made ready.
**19** The Lord shall reign for ages, and unto the age, and yet further!
    For the horse of Pharaoh with his chariots and his horsemen entered into the sea,
    and the Lord brought upon them the water of the sea;
    but the sons of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea.

**The Second Ode: The Song of Moses in Deuteronomy.**
**1** Give ear, O heavens, and I will speak;
**2** and let the earth hearken to the words of my mouth.
    Let my teaching be awaited as the rain,
    and let my words descend as the dew,
    as showers upon the tender herbage,
    and as snow upon the grass.
**3** For I have called upon the Name of the Lord;
    ascribe ye greatness unto our God!
**4** God, His works are true, and all His ways are judgment;
    a faithful God, and in Whom there is no unrighteousness;
    righteous and holy is the Lord.
**5** They have sinned; not unto Him are [they His] blameworthy children;
    a crooked generation and perverse.
**6** Do ye thus requite the Lord, O foolish people and not wise?
    Is not this He, thy Father Who hath acquired thee, and made thee,
    and created thee?
**7** Remember the days of old, consider the years of generations upon generations.
    Ask thy father, and he will declare [it] unto thee; [ask] thy elders,
