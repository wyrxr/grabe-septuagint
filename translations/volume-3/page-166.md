ΕΚΚΛΗΣΙΑΣΤΗΣ. ΚΕΦ. Α΄. Β΄.
**17** μου ἴδε πολλά, σοφίαν καὶ γνῶσιν· καὶ ἔδωκα καρδίαν μου τοῦ
    γνῶναι σοφίαν καὶ γνῶσιν, περιφορὰν καὶ ἐπιστήμην· ἔγνων ὅτι
**18** καί γε τοῦτό ἐστι προαίρεσις πνεύματος. Ὅτι ἐν πλήθει σοφίας
    πλῆθος γνώσεως, καὶ ὁ προστιθεὶς γνῶσιν, προσθήσει ἄλγημα.

ΚΕΦ. Β΄. ΙΙ.

**1** Εἶπον ἐγὼ ἐν καρδίᾳ μου· δεῦρο δή, πειράσω σε ἐν εὐφρο-
**2** σύνῃ, καὶ ἴδε ἐν ἀγαθῷ· καὶ ἰδοὺ καί γε τοῦτο ματαιότης. Τῷ
**3** γέλωτι εἶπα, “Περιφοράν!” καὶ τῇ εὐφροσύνῃ, “Τί τοῦτο ποιεῖς;” Καὶ
    κατεσκευάμην ἐν καρδίᾳ μου ἑλκύσειν εἰς οἶνον τὴν σάρκα μου· καὶ
    καρδία μου ὡδήγησεν ἐν σοφίᾳ, καὶ τοῦ κρατῆσαι ἐπ’ ἀφροσύνῃ,
    ἕως οὗ ἴδω ποῖον τὸ ἀγαθὸν τοῖς υἱοῖς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου, ὃ ποιήσουσιν
**4** ὑπὸ τὸν ἥλιον ἀριθμὸν ἡμερῶν ζωῆς αὐτῶν. Ἐμεγάλυνα ποιημά
**5** μου, ᾠκοδόμησά μοι οἴκους, ἐφύτευσά μοι ἀμπελῶνας, ἐποίησά μοι
    κήπους καὶ παραδείσους, καὶ ἐφύτευσα ἐν αὐτοῖς ξύλον πᾶν καρ-
**6** ποῦ· ἐποίησά μοι κολυμβήθρας ὑδάτων, τοῦ ποτίσαι ἀπ’ αὐτῶν
    δρυμὸν βλαστάντα ξύλα.
**7** Ἐκτησάμην δούλους καὶ παιδίσκας, καὶ
    οἰκογενεῖς ἐγένοντό μοι· καί γε κτῆσις βουκολίου καὶ ποιμνίου πολ-
    λὴ ἐγένετό μοι ὑπὲρ πάντας τοὺς γενομένους ἔμπροσθέν μου ἐν
**8** Ἱερουσαλήμ. Συνήγαγόν μοι καί γε ἀργύριον καί γε χρυσίον, καὶ
    περισυσιασμοὺς βασιλέων καὶ τῶν χωρῶν· ἐποίησά μοι ᾄδοντας
    καὶ ἀδούσας, καὶ ἐντρυφήματα υἱῶν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου, οἰνοχόον καὶ
    οἰνοχόης.
**9** Καὶ ἐμεγαλύνθην, καὶ προσέθηκα παρὰ πάντας τοὺς γε-
    νομένους ἔμπροσθέν μου ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ· καί γε σοφία μου ἐστάθη
**10** μοι. Καὶ πᾶν ὃ ᾔτησαν οἱ ὀφθαλμοί μου, οὐχ ὑφεῖλον ἀπ’ αὐτῶν,
    οὐκ ἀπεκώλυσα τὴν καρδίαν μου ἀπὸ πάσης εὐφροσύνης, ὅτι καρ-
    δία μου εὐφράνθη ἐν παντὶ μόχθῳ μου· καὶ τοῦτο ἐγένετο μερὶς
**11** μου ἀπὸ παντὸς μόχθου μου. Καὶ ἐπέβλεψα ἐγὼ ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς
    ποιήμασί μου οἷς ἐποίησαν αἱ χεῖρές μου, καὶ ἐν μόχθῳ (μου) ᾧ
    ἐμόχθησα τοῦ ποιεῖν· καὶ ἰδοὺ τὰ πάντα ματαιότης καὶ προαίρεσις
**12** πνεύματος, καὶ οὐκ ἔστι περίσσεια ὑπὸ τὸν ἥλιον. Καὶ ἐπέβλεψα
    ἐγὼ τοῦ ἰδεῖν σοφίαν καὶ περιφορὰν καὶ ἀφροσύνην· ὅτι τίς
    ἄνθρωπος ὃς ἐπελεύσεται ὀπίσω τῆς βουλῆς τὰ ὅσα ἐποίησαν αὐ-
**13** τήν; Καὶ ἰδὸν ἐγὼ ὅτι ἔστι περίσσεια τῇ σοφίᾳ ὑπὲρ τὴν ἀφρο-
**14** σύνην, ὡς περίσσεια τοῦ φωτὸς ὑπὲρ τὸ σκότος· τοῦ σοφοῦ οἱ

**ECCLESIASTES**

**CHAPTER 1**

**17** My heart, behold, many things: wisdom and knowledge;
    and I gave my heart to know wisdom and knowledge,
    folly and understanding; I perceived that
**18** this also is a striving after wind.
    For in much wisdom is much knowledge,
    and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.

**CHAPTER 2**

**1** I said in my heart, "Come now, I will prove you with mirth,
    and see what is good."
**2** And, behold, this also is vanity.
    Of laughter I said, "It is folly!"
    and of mirth, "What do you do?"
**3** And I prepared in my heart to draw my flesh unto wine,
    and my heart guided [me] in wisdom,
    and to lay hold upon folly,
    until I should see what is good for the sons of men
    to do under the sun for the number of the days of their life.
**4** I made great my work;
    I built for myself houses, I planted for myself vineyards;
**5** I made for myself gardens and paradises,
    and I planted in them every kind of fruit tree;
**6** I made for myself pools of water,
    to water from them a forest [with] growing trees.
**7** I acquired bondservants and bondmaidens,
    and homeborn [slaves] were born unto me;
    and also a great possession of herds and flocks was mine,
    more than all who were before me in Jerusalem.
**8** I gathered for myself also silver and also gold,
    and the collections of kings and of the provinces;
    I made for myself male singers and female singers,
    and the delights of the sons of men,
    a cupbearer and of a cupbeareress.
**9** So I was great, and increased beyond all them
    who were before me in Jerusalem;
    and also my wisdom remained with me.
**10** And whatsoever my eyes desired,
    I did not withhold from them;
    I did not restrain my heart from any joy,
    for my heart rejoiced in all my labour;
    and this became my portion from all my labour.
**11** And I looked upon all my works which my hands had wrought,
    and upon [all] the labour (my) wherein I had laboured to do [it];
    and, behold, all is vanity and a striving after wind,
    and there is no profit under the sun.
**12** And I turned to behold wisdom, and folly, and madness.
    For who is the man that shall come after the counsel,
    [even] the things which they did make her?
**13** And I beheld that wisdom excelleth folly,
    as the excellence of light excelleth darkness.
**14** The wise man's eyes are in his head,
    but the fool walketh in darkness.
