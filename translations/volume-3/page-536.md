ΚΕΦ. Ϛ΄. VI.

1 ΟΥΑΙ τοῖς ἐξουθενοῦσι Σιών, καὶ τοῖς πεποιθόσιν ἐπὶ τὸ ὄρος
2 τοῦ Ἰσραήλ. Διαβῆτε πάντες καὶ ἴδετε, καὶ διέλθατε ἐκεῖθεν
εἰς Αἰμαθαββά, καὶ κατάβητε ἐκεῖθεν εἰς Γὲθ ἀλλοφύλων, τὰς
3 κρατίστας ἐκ πασῶν τῶν βασιλειῶν τούτων· εἰ πλείονα τὰ ὅρια
αὐτῶν ἐστι τῶν ὑμετέρων ὁρίων; Οἱ ἐρχόμενοι εἰς ἡμέραν κα-
4 κήν, οἱ ἐγγίζοντες καὶ ἐφαπτόμενοι σαββάτων ψευδῶν· οἱ κα-
θεύδοντες ἐπὶ κλινῶν ἐλεφαντίνων, καὶ κατασπαταλῶντες ἐπὶ ταῖς
στρωμναῖς αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔσθοντες ἐρίφους ἐκ ποιμνίων, καὶ μοσχά-
5 ρια ἐκ μέσου βουκολίων γαλαθηνά· οἱ ἐπικροτοῦντες πρὸς τὴν
φωνὴν τῶν ὀργάνων, ὡς ἑστῶτα ἐλογίσαντο, καὶ οὐχ ὡς φεύγον-
6 τα· οἱ πίνοντες τὸν διυλισμένον οἶνον, καὶ τὰ πρῶτα μῦρα χριό-
7 μενοι, καὶ οὐκ ἔπασχον οὐδὲν ἐπὶ τῇ συντριβῇ Ἰωσήφ. Διὰ τοῦ-
το νῦν αἰχμάλωτοι ἔσονται ἀπ᾽ ἀρχῆς δυναστῶν, καὶ ἐξαρθήσε-
8 ται χρεμετισμὸς ἵππων ἐξ Ἐφραίμ. Ὅτι ὤμοσε Κύριος καθ᾽
ἑαυτοῦ· ὅτι βδελύσσομαι ἐγὼ πᾶσαν τὴν ὕβριν Ἰακώβ, καὶ τὰς
χώρας αὐτοῦ μεμίσηκα, καὶ ἐξαρῶ πόλιν σὺν πᾶσι τοῖς κατοί-
9 κοῦσιν αὐτήν· καὶ ἔσται, ἐὰν ὑπολειφθῶσι δέκα ἄνδρες ἐν οἰκίᾳ
10 μιᾷ, καὶ ἀποθανοῦνται, (καὶ ὑπολειφθήσονται οἱ κατάλοιποι·) καὶ
λήψονται οἱ οἰκεῖοι αὐτῷ, καὶ οἱ παραβιωταὶ τοῦ ἐξενέγκαι τὰ
ὀστᾶ αὐτῶν ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου· καὶ ἐρεῖ τοῖς προεστηκόσι τῆς οἰκίας·
εἰ ἔτι ὑπάρχει παρά σοί; καὶ ἐρεῖ· οὐκ ἔτι· καὶ ἐρεῖ· σίγα, ἵνα τοῦ
11 μὴ ὀνομάσαι τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου. Διότι ἰδοὺ Κύριος ἐν-
τέλλεται, καὶ πατάξει τὸν οἶκον τὸν μέγαν θλάσμασι, καὶ τὸν
12 οἶκον τὸν μικρὸν ῥήγμασιν. Εἰ διώξονται ἐν πέτραις ἵπποι; εἰ
παρασιωπήσονται ἐν θηλείαις; ὅτι ὑμεῖς ἐξεστρέψατε εἰς θυμὸν
13 κρίμα, καὶ καρπὸν δικαιοσύνης εἰς πικρίαν· οἱ εὐφραινόμενοι ἐπ᾽
οὐδενὶ λόγῳ, οἱ λέγοντες· οὐκ ἐν τῇ ἰσχύϊ ἡμῶν ἔσχομεν κέρα-
14 τα; Διότι ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐπεγείρω ἐφ᾽ ὑμᾶς, οἶκος τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, ἔθνος,
λέγει Κύριος τῶν δυνάμεων, καὶ ἐκθλίψουσιν ὑμᾶς τοῦ μὴ εἰσ-
ελθεῖν εἰς Αἰμάθ, καὶ ἕως τοῦ χειμάῤῥου τῶν δυσμῶν.

**CHAPTER 6**

**1** Woe unto them that do scorn Zion, and that put their trust upon the mountain of Israel!
**2** Go ye, all of you, and behold, and pass ye over thence unto Aimathabba, and go down thence unto Gath of the Philistines, which are the strongest of all these kingdoms: are their borders greater than your borders?
**3** Ye that draw nigh unto an evil day, and that touch upon false Sabbaths;
**4** who sleep upon beds of ivory, and wallow in luxury upon their couches, and eat the kids from the flocks, and suckling calves from the midst of the herds;
**5** who clap their hands to the sound of their instruments, and do reckon them as standing, and not as fleeting;
**6** who drink filtered wine, and anoint themselves with the chiefest ointments, and are not afflicted over the destruction of Joseph.
**7** Therefore now shall they be carried away captive, even among the first of the princes, and the neighing of horses shall be taken away from Ephraim.
**8** For the Lord hath sworn by Himself: Surely, I do abhor all the pride of Jacob, and I have hated his lands; and I will utterly destroy the city with all them that dwell therein.
**9** And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house, that they shall die.
**10** ([And] the remnant shall be left;) and his kinsmen shall take him, and they that live beside him, to bring forth their bones out of the house; and one shall say unto him that is set over the house, 'Is there yet any with thee?' And he shall say, 'No more.' Then shall he say, 'Be silent, lest the Name of the Lord be named.'
**11** For behold, the Lord doth command, and He shall smite the great house with mighty breaches, and the small house with grievous cracks.
**12** Shall horses run upon the rocks? Shall they be silent amongst females? For ye have turned judgment into wrath, and the fruit of righteousness into bitterness;
**13** ye that rejoice in a thing of naught, and say, 'Have we not by our own strength gotten us horns?'
**14** For behold, I will raise up against you, O house of Israel, a nation, saith the Lord of Hosts, and they shall afflict you, so that ye shall not enter into Aimath, and even unto the brook of the west.
