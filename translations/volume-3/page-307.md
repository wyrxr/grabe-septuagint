**ΚΕΦ. ΙΗ΄. 20.**
κακά; ὅτι συνελάλησαν ῥήματα κατὰ τῆς ψυχῆς μου, καὶ τὴν
κόλασιν αὐτῶν ἔκρυψάν μοι· μνήσθητι ἑστηκότος μου κατὰ πρό-
σωπὸν σοῦ, τοῦ λαλῆσαι ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν ἀγαθά, τοῦ ἀποστρέψαι
τὸν θυμόν σου ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν. **21** Διὰ τοῦτο δὸς τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτῶν εἰς
λιμόν, καὶ ἄθροισον αὐτοὺς εἰς χεῖρας μαχαίρας· γενέσθωσαν
αἱ γυναῖκες αὐτῶν ἄτεκνοι καὶ χῆραι, καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες αὐτῶν γε-
νέσθωσαν ἀνηρημένοι ἐν θανάτῳ, καὶ οἱ νεανίσκοι αὐτῶν πεπτω-
κότες ἐν μαχαίρᾳ ἐν πολέμῳ. **22** Γενηθήτω κραυγὴ ἐν ταῖς οἰκίαις
αὐτῶν, ἐπάξεις ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς λῃστὰς ἄφνω, ὅτι ἐνεχείρησαν λό-
γον εἰς σύλληψίν μου, καὶ παγίδας ἔκρυψαν ἐπ᾿ ἐμέ. **23** Καὶ σύ,
Κύριε Κύριε, ἔγνως ἅπασαν τὴν βουλὴν αὐτῶν, ἥν ἐβουλεύσαντο
ἐπ᾿ ἐμὲ εἰς θάνατον· μὴ ἀθώσῃς τὰς ἀδικίας αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰς
ἁμαρτίας τῶν πατέρων αὐτῶν ἀπὸ προσώπου σου μὴ ἐξα-
λείψῃς· γενέσθω ἡ ἀσθένεια αὐτῶν ἐναντίον σου, ἐν καιρῷ θυμοῦ
σου ποιήσῃς ἐν αὐτοῖς.

**ΚΕΦ. ΙΘ΄. XIX.**
**1** ΤΟΤΕ εἶπε Κύριος πρός μέ· βάδισον, καὶ κτῆσαι βικὸν πε-
πλασμένον ὀστράκινον, καὶ ἄξεις ἀπὸ τῶν πρεσβυτέρων τοῦ λαοῦ
σου, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν πρεσβυτέρων τῶν ἱερέων, **2** καὶ ἐξελεύσῃ εἰς τὸ
πολυάνδριον υἱῶν τῶν τέκνων αὐτῶν, ὃ ἐστιν ἐπὶ τῶν προθύρων
τῆς πύλης τῆς Χαρσεΐθ· καὶ ἀνάγνωθι ἐκεῖ πάντας τοὺς λόγους, οὓς
ἐὰν λαλήσω πρὸς σέ, καὶ ἐρεῖς αὐτοῖς· **3** ἀκούσατε λόγον Κυ-
ρίου, βασιλεῖς Ἰούδα, καὶ οἱ κατοικοῦντες Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ οἱ
εἰσπορευόμενοι ἐν ταῖς πύλαις ταύταις· τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς
Ἰσραήλ· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐπάγω ἐπὶ τὸν τόπον τοῦτον κακά, ὥστε παν-
τὸς ἀκούοντος αὐτὰ ἠχήσει τὰ ὦτα αὐτοῦ, **4** ἀνθ᾿ ὧν ἐγκατέλιπόν
με, καὶ ἀπηλλοτρίωσαν τὸν τόπον τοῦτον, καὶ ἐθυμίασαν ἐν αὐ-
τῷ θεοῖς ἀλλοτρίοις, οἷς οὐκ ᾔδεισαν αὐτοὶ καὶ οἱ πατέρες αὐτῶν·
καὶ οἱ βασιλεῖς Ἰούδα ἔπλησαν τὸν τόπον τοῦτον αἱμάτων ἀ-
θῴων, **5** καὶ ᾠκοδόμησαν ὑψηλὰ τῇ Βάαλ, τοῦ κατακαίειν τοὺς
υἱοὺς αὐτῶν ἐν πυρὶ ὁλοκαυτώματα τῷ Βάαλ, ἃ οὐκ ἐνετειλά-
μην, οὐδὲ ἐλάλησα, οὐδὲ διενοήθην ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ μου. **6** Διὰ τοῦτο
Ἰδοὺ ἡμέραι ἔρχονται, λέγει Κύριος, καὶ οὐ κληθήσεται ἔτι τῷ
τόπῳ τούτῳ διάπτωσις καὶ πολυάνδριον υἱοῦ Ἐννώμ, ἀλλ᾿ ἡ
πολυάνδριον τῆς σφαγῆς. **7** Καὶ σφάξω τὴν βουλὴν Ἰούδα, καὶ τὴν

### JEREMIAH 18

**20** ...evils? For they have spoken words against my soul, and they have hidden their malice from me. Remember, I stood before Thy face to speak good on their behalf, to turn away Thy wrath from them.
**21** Therefore, give their sons unto famine, and gather them into the hands of the sword. Let their wives be childless and widows; and let their husbands be slain by death, and their young men fallen by the sword in war.
**22** Let a cry arise in their houses; thou shalt bring robbers upon them suddenly, for they have undertaken a plot for my capture, and have hidden snares for me.
**23** And Thou, O Lord, O Lord, Thou hast known all their counsel which they have purposed against me unto death. Acquit Thou not their iniquities, and the sins of their fathers from before Thy face do Thou not wipe away. Let their feebleness be before Thee; in the time of Thy wrath, mayest Thou deal with them.

### JEREMIAH 19

**1** THEN said the Lord unto me, 'Go, and acquire a flask, a potter's vessel of clay; and thou shalt take [some] from the elders of thy people, and from the elders of the priests.
**2** And thou shalt go forth unto the burial-place of the sons of their children, which is by the entrance of the Gate of Harsith; and read thou there all the words which I shall speak unto thee. And thou shalt say unto them:
**3** Hear ye the word of the Lord, O kings of Judah, and ye that dwell in Jerusalem, and ye that enter in by these gates! Thus saith the Lord God of Israel: Behold, I bring evils upon this place, so that the ears of every one that heareth them shall tingle,
**4** because they have forsaken Me, and have alienated this place, and have burned incense in it unto alien gods, whom neither they nor their fathers knew; and the kings of Judah have filled this place with the blood of innocents,
**5** and have built high places to Baal, to burn their sons in fire as whole burnt offerings to Baal, which I commanded not, nor spake, neither did it enter into My heart.
**6** Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that this place shall no more be called [Topheth] and the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter.
**7** And I will bring to naught the counsel of Judah, and the
