¹² Ἠισχύνθησαν, ὅτι βδέλυγμα ἐποίησαν, καὶ αἰσχύνη οὐκ ἠισχύνθησαν, καὶ αἰσχυνθῆναι οὐκ οἴδασι· διὰ τοῦτο πεσοῦνται πίπτοντες,
¹³ ἐν καιρῷ ἐπισκοπῆς αὐτῶν πεσοῦνται, εἶπε Κύριος. Καὶ συνάξουσι τὰ γεννήματα αὐτῶν, λέγει Κύριος· οὐκ ἔστι σταφυλὴ ἐν ταῖς ἀμπέλοις, καὶ οὐκ ἔστι σῦκα ἐν ταῖς συκαῖς, καὶ τὰ φύλλα κατερρύηκεν· καὶ ἔδωκα αὐτοῖς, καὶ παρῆλθον αὐτούς.
¹⁴ Ἐπὶ τί ἡμεῖς καθήμεθα; συνάχθητε, καὶ εἰσέλθωμεν εἰς τὰς πόλεις τὰς ὀχυράς, καὶ ἀπορρίψωμεν ἐκεῖ, ὅτι ὁ Θεὸς ἀπέρριψεν ἡμᾶς,
¹⁵ καὶ ἐπότισεν ἡμᾶς ὕδωρ χολῆς, ὅτι ἡμάρτομεν ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ. Συνηχθήμεν εἰς εἰρήνην, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἀγαθά· εἰς καιρὸν ἰάσεως, καὶ ἰδοὺ σπουδή.
¹⁶ Ἐκ Δὰν ἀκουσόμεθα φωνὴν ὀξύτητος ἵππων αὐτοῦ· ἀπὸ φωνῆς χρεμετισμοῦ ἱππασίας ἵππων αὐτοῦ ἐσείσθη (ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ) πᾶσα ἡ γῆ, καὶ ἥξει καὶ καταφάγεται τὴν γῆν, καὶ τὸ πλήρωμα αὐτῆς,
¹⁷ πόλιν καὶ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας ἐν αὐτῇ. Διότι ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐξαποστέλλω εἰς ὑμᾶς ὄφεις θανατοῦντας, οἷς οὐκ ἔστιν ἐπᾷσαι,
¹⁸ καὶ δήξονται ὑμᾶς, φησὶ Κύριος, ἀνίατα μετ᾿ ὀδύνης καρδίας ὑμῶν ἀπερουμένης.
¹⁹ Ἰδοὺ φωνὴ κραυγῆς θυγατρὸς λαοῦ μου ἀπὸ γῆς μακρόθεν· μὴ Κύριος οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν Σιών; ἢ βασιλεὺς οὐκ ἔστιν ἐκεῖ; διότι παρώργισάν με ἐν τοῖς γλυπτοῖς αὐτῶν,
²⁰ καὶ ἐν ματαίοις ἀλλοτρίοις. Διῆλθε θέρος, παρῆλθεν ἄμητος,
²¹ καὶ ἡμεῖς οὐ διεσώθημεν. Ἐπὶ συντρίμματι θυγατρὸς λαοῦ μου συνετρίβην, ἐσκοτώθην· ἐν ἀπορίᾳ κατίσχυσάν με ὠδῖνες ὡς τικτούσης.
²² Μὴ ῥητίνη οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν Γαλαάδ, ἢ ἰατρὸς οὐκ ἔστιν ἐκεῖ; διατὶ οὐκ ἀνέβη ἴασις θυγατρὸς λαοῦ μου;

CHAPTER VIII.

**12** They were put to shame, for they wrought abomination; yet were they not at all ashamed, neither knew they how to blush. Therefore shall they fall grievously;
**13** in the time of their visitation shall they fall, saith the Lord. "I shall gather their produce," saith the Lord; "there is no grape on the vines, and no figs on the fig trees, and the leaves have fallen away. And I gave [these] unto them, and they have passed away from them."
**14** "Wherefore do we sit still? Gather yourselves, and let us enter into the fortified cities, and there let us be cast down; for the Lord God hath cast us off,
**15** and hath given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against Him." We gathered [ourselves] for peace, but no good came; [we looked] for a time of healing, and behold, there was trouble.
**16** From Dan shall we hear the keen cry of his horses; from the sound of the neighing of his prancing horses, all the earth was shaken (from it). And he shall come and devour the land, and the fullness thereof,
**17** the city and those who dwell therein. For behold, I shall send forth among you deadly serpents, which cannot be charmed;
**18** and they shall bite you incurably, saith the Lord, with pain, and your heart shall be in despair.
**19** Behold, the voice of the cry of the daughter of My people from a land far distant: "Is not the Lord in Zion? Or is there no King there?" Because they have provoked Me to wrath with their carved images,
**20** and with their vain alien gods. The summer is past, the harvest is ended,
**21** and we are not saved. For the crushing of the daughter of My people, I am crushed; I am brought into darkness. In perplexity, pains have seized me as those of a woman in childbirth.
**22** Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then hath the healing of the daughter of My people not come forth?

CHAPTER IX.

**1** Oh, that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears! Then would I weep day and night for this My people,
**2** and for the wounded of the daughter of My people. Oh, that I had in the wilderness a lodge for travelers, that I might leave My people and go forth from them! For all are adulterers, an assembly of faithless ones,
**3** and they have bent their tongue like a bow; falsehood, and not faithfulness, hath prevailed upon the earth. For they have gone forth from one evil to another,
**4** and have not known Me, saith the Lord. Let each man beware of his neighbor; for each one from his neighbor have they gone forth. And on your brethren, do not trust.
