ΗΣΑΙΑΣ
ἀγιάσατε τὸν φαυλίζοντα τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ, τὸν βδελυσσόμενον 7
ὑπὸ τῶν ἐθνῶν τῶν δούλων τῶν ἀρχόντων· βασιλεῖς ὄψονται αὐ-
τόν, καὶ ἀναστήσονται ἄρχοντες, καὶ προσκυνήσουσιν αὐτῷ, ἕ-
νεκεν Κυρίου· ὅτι πιστὸς ἐστιν ὁ ἅγιος Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐξελεξά-
μην σε. Οὕτως λέγει Κύριος· καιρῷ δεκτῷ ἐπήκουσά σου, καὶ ἐν 8
ἡμέρᾳ σωτηρίας ἐβοήθησά σοι, καὶ ἔπλασά σε, καὶ ἔδωκά σε εἰς
διαθήκην ἐθνῶν τοῦ καταστῆσαι τὴν γῆν, καὶ κληρονομῆσαι κλη-
ρονομίας ἐρήμους, λέγοντα τοῖς ἐν δεσμοῖς, ἐξέλθατε, καὶ τοῖς 9
ἐν τῷ σκότει, ἀνακαλυφθῆναι· καὶ ἐν πάσαις ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὐτῶν βο-
σκηθήσονται, καὶ ἐν πάσαις ταῖς τρίβοις ἡ νομὴ αὐτῶν. Οὐ 10
πεινά σουσιν, οὐδὲ διψήσουσιν, μὴ πατάξει αὐτοὺς ὁ καύσων,
οὐδὲ ὁ ἥλιος, ἀλλὰ ὁ ἐλεῶν αὐτοὺς παρακαλέσει αὐτούς, καὶ
διὰ πηγῶν ὑδάτων ἄξει αὐτούς, καὶ θήσω πᾶν ὄρος εἰς ὁ- 11
δόν, καὶ πᾶσαν τρίβον εἰς βόσκημα αὐτοῖς. Ἰδοὺ οὗτοι πόρ- 12
ρωθεν ἥξουσιν, οὗτοι ἀπὸ βορρᾶ, καὶ οὗτοι ἀπὸ θαλάσσης,
ἄλλοι δὲ ἐκ γῆς Περσῶν. Εὐφραίνεσθε οὐρανοί, καὶ ἀγαλλιάσθω 13
ἡ γῆ, ῥηξάτωσαν τὰ ὄρη εὐφροσύνην, ὅτι ἠλέησεν ὁ Θεὸς τὸν
λαὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοὺς ταπεινοὺς τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ παρεκάλεσεν.
Εἶπε δὲ Σιών, ἐγκατέλιπέ με Κύριος, καὶ Κύριος ἐπελάθετό 14
μου. Μὴ ἐπιλήσεται γυνὴ τοῦ παιδίου αὐτῆς, τοῦ μὴ ἐλεῆσαι τὰ 15
ἔκγονα τῆς κοιλίας αὐτῆς; εἰ δὲ καὶ ἐπιλάθοιτο ταῦτα γυνή,
ἀλλ᾽ ἐγὼ οὐκ ἐπιλήσομαί σου, εἶπε Κύριος. Ἰδοὺ ἐπὶ τῶν χει- 16
ρῶν μου ἐζωγράφησά σου τὰ τείχη, καὶ ἐνώπιόν μου εἶ δια-
παντὸς, καὶ ταχὺ οἰκοδομηθήσῃ ὑφ᾽ ὧν καθῃρέθης, καὶ οἱ ἐρη- 17
μώσαντές σε ἐκ σοῦ ἐξελεύσονται. Ἆρον κύκλῳ τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς 18
σου, καὶ ἴδε πάντας, ἰδοὺ συνήχθησαν, καὶ ἦλθοσαν πρός σέ·
ζῶ ἐγὼ λέγει Κύριος, ὅτι πάντας αὐτοὺς ἐνδύση, καὶ περιθήση
αὐτοὺς, ὡς κόσμον νύμφῃ. Ὅτι τὰ ἔρημά σου καὶ τὰ διεφθαρ- 19
μένα καὶ τὰ πεπτωκότα, ὅτι νῦν στενοχωρήσει ἀπὸ τῶν ἐνοικούν-
των, καὶ μακρυνθήσονται ἀπὸ σοῦ οἱ καταπίνοντές σε. Ἐροῦσι 20
γὰρ εἰς τὰ ὦτά σου οἱ υἱοί σου, οὓς ἀπολώλεκας, στενός μοι ὁ
τόπος, ποίησόν μοι τόπον, ἵνα κατοικήσω. Καὶ ἐρεῖς ἐν τῇ καρ- 21
δίᾳ σου· τίς ἐγέννησέ μοι τούτους; ἐγὼ δὲ ἄτεκνος καὶ χήρα,
πάροικος καὶ ἐγκεκλεισμένη, τούτους δὲ τίς ἐξέθρεφέ μοι; ἐγὼ
δὲ κατελείφθην μόνη, οὗτοι δέ μοι ποῦ ἦσαν; Οὕτως λέγει Κύ- 22
ριος Κύριος· Ἰδοὺ αἴρω εἰς τὰ ἔθνη τὴν χεῖρά μου, καὶ εἰς τὰς

#### Chapter 49

**7** Honor ye him that hath made his soul vile,
    [even] him that is abhorred by the nations, [and] by the servants of the rulers.
    Kings shall see him, and rulers shall rise up, and they shall worship him,
    because of the Lord; for faithful is the Holy One of Israel, and I have chosen thee.
**8** Thus saith the Lord:
    'In an acceptable time have I hearkened unto thee,
    and in the day of salvation have I helped thee;
    and I have formed thee, and given thee for a covenant of nations,
    to restore the earth, and to inherit the desolate inheritances;
**9** Saying to those in bonds, "Go forth!"
    and to those in darkness, "Be revealed!"
    And in all their ways shall they be fed,
    and in all the paths shall their pasture be.
**10** They shall not hunger, nor shall they thirst;
    neither shall the burning heat smite them, nor the sun.
    But He that hath mercy upon them shall comfort them,
**11** And through springs of waters shall He lead them,
    and I will make every mountain into a way,
    and every path for them into a pasture.
**12** Behold, these shall come from afar;
    these from the North, and these from the sea,
    and others from the land of the Persians.
**13** Rejoice, O heavens, and let the earth exult;
    let the mountains burst forth with joy,
    for God hath had mercy on His people,
    and hath comforted the humble of His people.
**14** But Zion said, 'The Lord hath forsaken me,
    and the Lord hath forgotten me.'
**15** 'Shall a woman forget her child,
    so as not to have compassion on the offspring of her womb?
    Yea, though a woman should forget these,
**16** Yet will I not forget thee,' saith the Lord.
    'Behold, upon My hands have I depicted thy walls,
    and thou art continually before Me;
**17** And quickly shalt thou be built by those by whom thou wert cast down;
    and they that laid thee waste shall depart from thee.
**18** Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold them all;
    behold, they are gathered together, and are come unto thee.
    'As I live,' saith the Lord,
    'Thou shalt surely clothe thyself with all of them,
    and put them on, as a bride doth her ornament.
**19** For thy desolate places, and thy corrupted places, and thy fallen places,
    yea, now shall it be too narrow because of the inhabitants;
    and they that swallowed thee up shall be far from thee.
**20** For thy sons, whom thou hast lost, shall say in thine ears,
    'The place is too narrow for me; make me a place that I may dwell.'
**21** And thou shalt say in thine heart,
    'Who hath begotten these for me?
    For I am childless and a widow,
    a sojourner and shut in.
    And who hath brought up these for me?
    I was left alone; and where were these for me?'
**22** Thus saith the Lord, even the Lord:
    'Behold, I lift up My hand unto the nations,
    and [My sign] unto the islands.'
