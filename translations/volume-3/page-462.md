οἰκοδόμων, καὶ κάλαμος μέτρον ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ· καὶ αὐτὸς
4 εἰστήκει ἐπὶ τῆς πύλης, καὶ εἶπε πρός με ὁ ἀνήρ· Ἑώρακας σὺ
υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, ἴδε ἐν τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς σου, καὶ ἐν τοῖς ὠσί σου ἄ-
κους, καὶ τάξον εἰς τὴν καρδίαν σου πάντα ὅσα ἐγὼ δεικνύω σοι,
διότι ἕνεκα τοῦ δεῖξαί σοι εἰσελήλυθας ὧδε, καὶ δείξεις πάντα
5 ὅσα σὺ ὁρᾷς τῷ οἴκῳ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἰδοὺ περίβολος ἔξωθεν τοῦ
οἴκου κύκλῳ, καὶ ἐν τῇ χειρὶ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς κάλαμος, τὸ μέτρον
πήχεων ἓξ ἐν πήχει καὶ παλαιστῇς, καὶ διεμέτρησε τὸ προτεί-
χισμα, τὸ πλάτος ἴσον τῷ καλάμῳ, καὶ τὸ ὕψος αὐτοῦ ἴσον τῷ
6 καλάμῳ. Καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὴν πύλην τὴν βλέπουσαν κατὰ ἀνα-
τολὰς ἐν ἑπτὰ ἀναβαθμοῖς, καὶ διεμέτρησε Θεὲ ἐξ ἔνθεν, καὶ ἐξ
7 ἔνθεν, καὶ τὸ Αἰλὰμ τῆς πύλης ἴσον τῷ καλάμῳ, καὶ τὸ Θεὶ
ἴσον τῷ καλάμῳ τὸ μῆκος, καὶ ἴσον τῷ καλάμῳ τὸ πλάτος, καὶ τὸ
Αἰλὰμ ἀναμέσον τοῦ Θηλὰδ πηχῶν ἕξ· καὶ τὸ Θεὲ τὸ δεύτερον, ἴσον
τῷ καλάμῳ τὸ πλάτος, καὶ ἴσον τῷ καλάμῳ μῆκος, καὶ τὸ Αἰλὰμ
πηχέων πέντε, καὶ τὸ Θεὲ τὸ τρίτον, ἴσον τῷ καλάμῳ τὸ μῆκος, καὶ
ἴσον τῷ καλάμῳ τὸ πλάτος, καὶ τὸ Αἰλὰμ τοῦ πυλῶνος, πλησίον τοῦ
8 Αἰλὰμ τῆς πύλης ἔσωθεν ἴσον τῷ καλάμῳ, καὶ διεμέτρησε τὸ Αἰ-
9 λὰμ τῆς πύλης πηχῶν ὀκτὼ, καὶ ἐμέτρησε τὸ Αἰλὰμ τῆς πύλης ἀ-
κτὼ πηχῶν, καὶ τὰ Αἰλεῦ πηχῶν δύο· καὶ τὸ Αἰλὰμ τῆς πύλης ἔσω-
10 θεν, καὶ τὸ Θεὲ τῆς πύλης Θεὲ κατέναντι, τρεῖς ἔνθεν καὶ τρεῖς ἔνθεν·
καὶ μέτρον ἐν τοῖς τρισὶ, καὶ μέτρον ἐν τῷ Αἰλὰμ ἔνθεν καὶ ἔνθεν.
11 Καὶ διεμέτρησε τὸ πλάτος τῆς θύρας τοῦ πυλῶνος, πήχεων δέκα,
12 καὶ τὸ εὖρος τοῦ πυλῶνος πήχεων δεκατριῶν, καὶ πήχυς ἐπι-
συναγόμενος κατὰ πρόσωπον τῶν Θεεὶμ πήχεος ἑνὸς καὶ πήχεος
ἑνὸς, ἔριον ἔνθεν καὶ ἔνθεν, καὶ τὸ Θεὲ πήχεων ἓξ ἔνθεν, καὶ
13 πήχεων ἓξ ἔνθεν. Καὶ διεμέτρησε τὴν πύλην ἀπὸ τοῦ τείχους
τοῦ Θεὲ ἐπὶ τὸν τοῖχον τοῦ Θεὲ, πλάτος πήχεις εἴκοσι καὶ πέντε·
14 αὕτη πύλη ἐπὶ πύλην, καὶ τὸ αἴθριον τοῦ Αἰλὰμ τῆς πύλης ἑ-
ξήκοντα πήχεις (εἴκοσι πέντε) καὶ τὸ Θεὲμ τῆς αὐλῆς τῆς πύλης
15 κύκλῳ, καὶ τὸ αἴθριον τῆς πύλης ἔξωθεν, εἰς τὸ αἴθριον (τῆς
16 πύλης) τοῦ Αἰλὰμ τῆς πύλης ἔσωθεν πήχεων πεντήκοντα. Καὶ
θυρίδες κρυπταὶ ἐπὶ τὰ Θεεὶμ, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ Αἰλὰμ ἔσωθεν τῆς πύ-
λης τῆς αὐλῆς, κυκλόθεν· καὶ ὡσαύτως τοῖς Αἰλὰμ θυρίδες κύ-
κλῳ ἔσωθεν, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸ Αἰλὰμ φοίνικες ἔνθεν καὶ ἔνθεν. Καὶ εἰ-
σήγαγέ με εἰς τὴν αὐλὴν τὴν ἐσωτέραν, καὶ ἰδοὺ παστοφόρια,

3 a builder's measuring line, and a measuring reed in his hand; and he
4 stood upon the gate, and the man said unto me, "Hast thou seen, son of man? Behold with thine eyes, and with thine ears thou hast heard; and set in thine heart all things whatsoever I show unto thee; for to show thee hast thou come hither; and thou shalt show all things whatsoever thou seest to the house of Israel."
5 And behold, a wall without the house round about; and in the hand of the man a reed, the measure of six cubits [which were] a cubit and handbreadths. And he measured the outmost wall, the breadth [thereof being] equal to the reed, and the height thereof equal to the reed.
6 And he entered into the gate that looketh toward the east, upon seven steps; and he measured the The' from one side, and from the other side. And the Ailam of the gate was equal to the reed; and the Thei was equal to the reed in length, and equal to the reed in breadth. And the Ailam between the Thilad was six cubits.
7 And the second The' was equal to the reed in breadth, and equal to the reed in length; and the Ailam was five cubits. And the third The' was equal to the reed in length, and equal to the reed in breadth; and the Ailam of the gate, nigh unto the
8 Ailam of the gate within, was equal to the reed. And he measured the Ai-
9 lam of the gate, eight cubits; and he measured the Ailam of the gate, akto cubits; and the Aileu, two cubits. And the Ailam of the gate within,
10 and the The' of the gate, the The' over against [it], [were] three from one side and three from the other side; and a measure in the three, and a measure in the Ailam from one side and from the other.
11 And he measured the breadth of the door of the gate, ten cubits,
12 and the width of the gate, thirteen cubits. And a cubit added over against the Theim, of one cubit and one cubit, [and] wool from one side and from the other; and the The' of six cubits from one side, and
13 of six cubits from the other side. And he measured the gate from the wall of the The' unto the wall of the The', a breadth of twenty and five cubits.
14 This gate [was] upon [the] gate; and the porch of the Ailam of the gate, sixty cubits (twenty-five); and the Theem of the court of the gate
15 round about. And the porch of the gate without, unto the porch (of the gate) of the Ailam of the gate within, [was] fifty cubits.
16 And there were hidden windows upon the Theim, and upon the Ailam within the gate of the court, round about; and likewise to the Ailam, windows round about within; and upon the Ailam, palm [tree designs], from one side and from the other. And he brought me into the inner court, and behold, [there were] pastophoria,
