τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ, οὐδὲ πατὴρ λήψεται τὴν ἀδικίαν τοῦ υἱοῦ
αὐτοῦ· δικαιοσύνη δικαίου ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν ἔσται, καὶ ἀνομία ἀνόμου
ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν ἔσται. Ἐὰν δὲ ἀποστραφῇ ἄνομος ἀπὸ πασῶν τῶν 21
ἀνομιῶν αὐτοῦ ὧν ἐποίησε, καὶ φυλάξῃ πάσας τὰς ἐντολάς μου,
καὶ ποιήσῃ δικαιοσύνην καὶ ἔλεος, ζωῇ ζήσεται, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἀπο-
θάνῃ· πᾶσαι αἱ ἀδικίαι αὐτοῦ, ἃς ἐποίησεν, οὐ μὴ μνησθῶσιν, 22
ἀλλ᾿ ἐν τῇ δικαιοσύνῃ αὐτοῦ ᾗ ἐποίησεν, ἐν αὐτῇ ζήσεται. Μὴ θε- 23
λήσει θελήσω τὸν θάνατον τοῦ ἀνόμου, λέγει Κύριος Κύριος, ὡς
τὸ ἀποστρέψαι αὐτὸν ἐκ τῆς ὁδοῦ αὐτοῦ τῆς πονηρᾶς, καὶ ζῆν αὐ-
τόν; Ἐν δὲ τῷ ἀποστρέψαι δίκαιον ἀπὸ τῆς δικαιοσύνης αὐτοῦ, 24
καὶ ποιῆσαι ἀδικίαν κατὰ πάσας τὰς ἀνομίας, ἃς ἐποίησεν ὁ ἄνο-
μος, καὶ ποιήσει, καὶ ζήσεται; πᾶσαι αἱ δικαιοσύναι αὐτοῦ ἃς ἐ-
ποίησεν, οὐ μὴ μνησθῶσιν· ἐν τῷ παραπτώματι αὐτοῦ ᾧ παρέπεσε,
καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις αὐτοῦ αἷς ἥμαρτεν, ἐν αὐταῖς ἀποθανεῖται.
Καὶ εἴπατε· οὐ κατευθυνεῖ ἡ ὁδὸς Κυρίου· ἀκούσατε δὴ πᾶς οἶκος 25
Ἰσραήλ· μὴ ἡ ὁδός μου οὐ κατευθυνεῖ; οὐχὶ ἡ ὁδὸς ὑμῶν οὐ κατευ-
θυνεῖ; Ἐν τῷ ἀποστρέψαι δίκαιον ἐκ τῆς δικαιοσύνης αὐτοῦ, καὶ 26
ποιήσῃ παράπτωμα, καὶ ἀποθάνῃ ἐν τῷ παραπτώματι ᾧ ἐποίη-
σεν, ἐν αὐτῷ ἀποθανεῖται. Καὶ ἐν τῷ ἀποστρέψαι ἄνομον ἀπὸ τῆς 27
ἀνομίας αὐτοῦ ἧς ἐποίησε, καὶ ποιήσῃ κρίμα καὶ δικαιοσύνην, οὗτος
τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ ἐφύλαξε. Καὶ ἰδε, καὶ ἀπέστρεψεν ἐκ πασῶν 28
τῶν ἀσεβειῶν αὐτοῦ ὧν ἐποίησε, ζωὴ ζήσεται, οὐ μὴ ἀποθάνῃ.
Καὶ λέγουσιν ὁ οἶκος Ἰσραήλ, οὐ κατορθοῖ ἡ ὁδὸς Κυρίου· μὴ ἡ 29
ὁδὸς μου οὐ κατορθοῖ οἶκος Ἰσραήλ; οὐχὶ ἡ ὁδὸς ὑμῶν οὐ κατορ-
θοῖ; Διὰ τοῦτο ἕκαστον κατὰ τὴν ὁδὸν αὐτοῦ κρινῶ ὑμᾶς, οἶκος 30
Ἰσραήλ, λέγει Ἄδωναΐ Κύριος· ἐπιστράφητε καὶ ἀποστρέψατε ἐκ
πασῶν τῶν ἀσεβειῶν ὑμῶν, καὶ οὐκ ἔσονται ὑμῖν εἰς κόλασιν ἀδι-
κίας. Ἀπορρίψατε ἀπὸ ἑαυτῶν πάσας τὰς ἀσεβείας ὑμῶν ἃς ἠσε- 31
βήσατε εἰς ἐμέ, καὶ ποιήσατε ἑαυτοῖς καρδίαν καινὴν καὶ πνεῦμα
καινόν, καὶ ποιήσατε πάσας τὰς ἐντολάς μου· καὶ ἵνατι ἀποθνήσκετε
οἶκος Ἰσραήλ; λέγει Κύριος· Διότι οὐ θέλω τὸν θάνατον τοῦ 32
ἀποθνήσκοντος, λέγει Ἄδωναΐ Κύριος· καὶ ἐπιστρέψατε, καὶ ζήσατε.

### Chapter 18

**20** of his father, nor shall a father bear the iniquity of his son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the lawlessness of the lawless shall be upon him.
**21** But if the lawless man turn from all his lawless deeds which he hath committed, and keep all My commandments, and do righteousness and mercy, he shall surely live, and shall not die.
**22** All his iniquities that he hath committed shall by no means be remembered; but in his righteousness which he hath done, in it shall he live.
**23** Do I in any wise desire the death of the lawless, saith Adonai the Lord, as that he should turn from his wicked way and live?
**24** But if a righteous man turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity according to all the lawless deeds which the lawless man hath committed, and he do [them], shall he live? All his righteous deeds which he hath done shall by no means be remembered. In his transgression wherewith he hath transgressed, and in his sins wherein he hath sinned, in them shall he die.
**25** And ye have said, "The way of the Lord is not just." Hearken now, O house of Israel: Is it My way that is not just? Is it not rather your way that is not just?
**26** When a righteous man turneth from his righteousness, and committeth a transgression, and dieth in the transgression which he hath committed, in it shall he die.
**27** And when a lawless man turneth from his lawlessness which he hath committed, and doeth judgment and righteousness, this man hath preserved his soul.
**28** And behold, he hath turned from all his impieties which he hath committed; he shall surely live, and shall not die.
**29** And the house of Israel saith, "The way of the Lord is not right." Is it My way that is not right, O house of Israel? Is it not rather your way that is not right?
**30** Therefore I will judge each of you according to his way, O house of Israel, saith Adonai the Lord. Repent ye and turn away from all your impieties, and they shall not be unto you a punishment for iniquity.
**31** Cast away from yourselves all your impieties which ye have committed against Me, and make for yourselves a new heart and a new spirit, and keep all My commandments. And why do ye die, O house of Israel?
**32** Saith the Lord: For I desire not the death of him that dieth, saith Adonai the Lord; but turn ye back, and live.

### Chapter 19

**1** Moreover thou, son of man, take up a lamentation for the prince of Israel,
**2** And thou shalt say, "What is thy mother? A lioness, among lions [was she] e-"
