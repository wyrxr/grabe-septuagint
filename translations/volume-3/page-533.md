αὐτῶν. Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεός˙ Πῦρ κυκλόθεν 11
ἡ γῆ σου ἐρημωθήσεται, καὶ κατάξει ἐκ σοῦ ἰσχύν σου, καὶ δι-
αρπαγήσονται αἱ χῶραί σου. Τάδε λέγει Κύριος˙ ὃν τρόπον ὅταν 12
ἐκσπάσῃ ὁ ποιμὴν ἐκ στόματος τοῦ λέοντος δύο σκέλη ἢ λοβὸν
ὠτίου, οὕτως ἐκσπασθήσονται οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ, οἱ κατοικοῦντες
ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ κατέναντι φυλῆς καὶ ἐν Δαμασκῷ Ἱερεῖς. Ἀκού- 13
σατε καὶ ἐπιμαρτύρασθε τῷ οἴκῳ Ἰακώβ, λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς
ὁ παντοκράτωρ˙ διότι ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ὅταν ἐκδικήσω ἀσεβείας τοῦ 14
Ἰσραὴλ ἐπ᾽ αὐτόν, καὶ ἐκδικήσω ἐπὶ τὰ θυσιαστήρια Βαιθήλ, καὶ
κατασκαφήσεται τὰ κέρατα τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου, καὶ πεσοῦνται ἐπὶ
τὴν γῆν˙ συγχεῶ καὶ πατάξω τὸν οἶκον τὸν περίπτερον ἐπὶ τὸν 15
οἶκον τὸν θερινόν, καὶ ἀπολοῦνται οἶκοι ἐλεφάντινοι, καὶ προστε-
θήσονται οἶκοι ἕτεροι πολλοί, λέγει Κύριος.

ΚΕΦ. Δ΄. IV.

ἈΚΟΥΣΑΤΕ τὸν λόγον τοῦτον δαμάλεις τῆς Βασανίτιδος, 1
αἱ ἐν τῷ ὄρει τῆς Σαμαρείας, αἱ καταδυναστεύουσαι πτωχούς,
καὶ καταπατοῦσαι πένητας, αἱ λέγουσαι τοῖς κυρίοις αὑτῶν˙ ἐπί-
δοτε ἡμῖν, ὅπως πίωμεν. Ὀμνύει Κύριος κατὰ τῶν ἁγίων αὐτοῦ˙ 2
ὅτι ἰδοὺ ἡμέραι ἔρχονται ἐφ᾽ ὑμᾶς, καὶ λήψονται ὑμᾶς ἐν ὅπλοις,
καὶ τοὺς μεθ᾽ ὑμῶν εἰς λέβητας ἔμπυροι λοιμοὶ˙ καὶ ἐξενεχθή- 3
σεσθε γυνὴ κατέναντι ἀλλήλων, καὶ ἀπορριφήσεσθε εἰς τὸ ὄρος
τὸ Ῥεμμάμ, λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεός. Εἰσήλθατε εἰς Βαιθήλ, καὶ 4
ἠνομήσατε, καὶ εἰς Γάλγαλα ἐπληθύνατε τοῦ ἀσεβῆσαι, καὶ ἠνέγ-
κατε εἰς τὸ πρωῒ θυσίας ὑμῶν, εἰς τὴν τριημερίαν τὰ ἐπιδέκατα
ὑμῶν˙ καὶ ἀνέγνωσαν ἔξω νόμον, καὶ ἐπεκαλέσαντο ὁμολογίας˙ 5
ἀπαγγείλατε ὅτι ταῦτα ἠγάπησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ, λέγει Κύριος
ὁ Θεός. Καὶ ἐγὼ δώσω ὑμῖν γομφιασμὸν ὀδόντων ἐν πάσαις ταῖς 6
πόλεσιν ὑμῶν, καὶ ἔνδειαν ἄρτων ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς τόποις ὑμῶν, καὶ
οὐκ ἐπεστρέψατε πρὸς μέ, λέγει Κύριος. Καὶ ἐγὼ ἀνέσχον ἐξ ὑμῶν 7
τὸν ὑετὸν πρὸ τριῶν μηνῶν τοῦ τρυγητοῦ, καὶ βρέξω ἐπὶ πόλιν
μίαν, ἐπὶ δὲ πόλιν μίαν οὐ βρέξω˙ μερὶς μία βραχήσεται, καὶ
μερὶς ἐφ᾽ ἣν οὐ βρέξω ἐπ᾽ αὐτήν, ξηρανθήσεται˙ καὶ συναθροισθή- 8
σονται δύο πόλεις καὶ τρεῖς πόλεις εἰς πόλιν μίαν τοῦ πιεῖν ὕδωρ,
καὶ οὐ μὴ ἐμπλησθῶσι, καὶ οὐδ᾽ ὡς ἐπεστρέψατε πρὸς μέ, λέγει [Κύριος].

**CHAPTER 3**

**11** ...their lands. Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Fire round about thy land shall lay it waste, and He shall bring down from thee thy strength, and thy lands shall be plundered.
**12** Thus saith the Lord: In such wise as when the shepherd doth snatch from the lion's mouth two shanks, or a lobe of an ear, even so shall the children of Israel be snatched away, those who dwell in Samaria over against [their] tribe, and [those who are] priests in Damascus.
**13** Hear ye, and bear witness unto the house of Jacob, saith the Lord God Almighty:
**14** For in the day when I shall avenge the impieties of Israel upon him, and I shall avenge upon the altars of Bethel, then shall the horns of the altar be dug down, and they shall fall unto the earth.
**15** I will confound and smite the peristyle house upon the summer house; and ivory houses shall perish, and many other houses shall be added [unto these for destruction], saith the Lord.

**CHAPTER 4**

**1** Hear ye this word, ye heifers of Basan, who are upon the mount of Samaria, who oppress the poor, and crush the needy, who say unto their masters, "Give us [wine], that we may drink."
**2** The Lord hath sworn by His holy ones: that, behold, the days come upon you, and they shall take you with weapons; and the fiery pestilences shall take those with you into cauldrons.
**3** And ye shall be brought forth, each woman over against the other; and ye shall be cast forth unto the Mount Remmam, saith the Lord God.
**4** Ye came unto Bethel, and transgressed; and unto Gilgal ye multiplied your ungodliness; and ye brought your sacrifices in the morning, [and] your tithes on the third day.
**5** And they publicly read out a law, and they proclaimed [their] vows. Declare ye that these things the children of Israel loved, saith the Lord God.
**6** And I, for My part, shall give unto you a cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and a lack of bread in all your places; yet ye returned not unto Me, saith the Lord.
**7** And I, for My part, withheld the rain from you three months before the harvest; and I shall rain upon one city, but upon another city I shall not rain.
**8** One portion shall be watered, and the portion upon which I shall not rain, it shall be dried up; and two cities and three cities shall be gathered unto one city to drink water, yet they shall not be satisfied; and not even so did ye return unto Me, saith [the Lord].
