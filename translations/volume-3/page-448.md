`ἐλθοῦσα ἡ ῥομφαία λάβῃ ἐξ αὐτῶν ψυχὴν, αὕτη διὰ τὴν αὐτῆς`
`ἀνομίαν ἐλήφθη, καὶ τὸ αἷμα αὐτῆς ἐκ τῆς χειρὸς τοῦ σκοποῦ`
`7 ἐκζητήσω. Καὶ σὺ υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, σκοπὸν δέδωκά σε τῷ οἴκῳ Ἰσραήλ,`
`καὶ ἀκούσῃ ἐκ στόματός μου λόγον, καὶ προφυλάξεις αὐτοὺς παρ’ ἐμοῦ.`
`8 Ἐν τῷ εἰπεῖν με τῷ ἀνόμῳ, θανάτῳ θανατωθήσῃ, καὶ ἐὰν μὴ λαλήσῃς`
`τοὺς λόγους, τοῦ φυλάξασθαι τὸν ἄνομον ἀπὸ τῆς ὁδοῦ αὐτοῦ, αὐτὸς ὁ`
`ἄνομος τῇ ἀνομίᾳ αὐτοῦ ἀποθανεῖται, καὶ τὸ αἷμα αὐτοῦ ἐκ τῆς χειρός`
`σου ἐκζητήσω. 9 Σὺ δὲ ἐὰν προαπαγγείλῃς τῷ ἀσεβεῖ τὴν ὁδὸν αὐτοῦ,`
`τοῦ ἀποστρέψαι αὐτὸν ἀπ’ αὐτῆς, καὶ μὴ ἀποστρέψῃ ἀπὸ τῆς ὁδοῦ`
`αὐτοῦ, οὗτος τῇ ἀνομίᾳ αὐτοῦ ἀποθανεῖται, καὶ σὺ τὴν ψυχήν σου`
`ἐῤῥύσω. 10 Καὶ σὺ υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, εἰπὸν τῷ οἴκῳ Ἰσραήλ, οὕτως`
`ἐλαλήσατε λέγοντες· ὅτι αἱ πλάναι ἡμῶν, καὶ αἱ ἀνομίαι ἡμῶν ἐφ’`
`ἡμᾶς εἰσι· καὶ ἐν αὐταῖς ἡμεῖς τηκόμεθα, καὶ πῶς ζησόμεθα; 11 Εἰπὸν`
`αὐτοῖς· Ζῶ ἐγώ, λέγει Ἄδωναι Κύριος, οὐ βούλομαι τὸν θάνατον τοῦ`
`ἁμαρτωλοῦ, ὡς τὸ ἀποστρέψαι τὸν ἀσεβῆ ἀπὸ τῆς ὁδοῦ αὐτοῦ τῆς`
`πονηρᾶς, καὶ ζῆν αὐτόν· ἀποστροφῇ ἀποστρέψατε ἀπὸ τῶν ὁδῶν`
`ὑμῶν τῶν πονηρῶν· καὶ ἵνατί ἀποθνήσκετε οἶκος Ἰσραήλ; 12 Καὶ σὺ`
`υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, εἰπὸν πρὸς τοὺς υἱοὺς τοῦ λαοῦ σου· δικαιοσύνη`
`δικαίου οὐ μὴ ἐξέλῃται αὐτόν, ἐν ᾗ ἂν ἡμέρᾳ πλανηθῇ· καὶ ἀνομία`
`ἀνόμου οὐ μὴ κακώσῃ αὐτόν, ἐν ᾗ ἂν ἡμέρᾳ ἀποστρέψῃ ἀπὸ τῆς`
`ἀνομίας αὐτοῦ· καὶ δίκαιος οὐ μὴ δυνήσεται σωθῆναι ἐν ἡμέρᾳ`
`ἁμαρτίας αὐτοῦ. 13 Ἐν τῷ εἰπεῖν με τῷ δικαίῳ, ζωῇ ζήσῃ, καὶ οὗτος`
`πέποιθεν ἐπὶ τῇ δικαιοσύνῃ αὐτοῦ, καὶ (ἐὰν) ποιήσῃ ἀδικίαν, πᾶσαι αἱ`
`δικαιοσύναι αὐτοῦ ἃς ἐποίησεν, οὐ μὴ μνησθῶσιν, ἐν τῇ ἀδικίᾳ αὐτοῦ ᾗ`
`ἐποίησεν, ἐν αὐτῇ ἀποθανεῖται, καὶ ἐν 14 τῷ εἰπεῖν με τῷ ἀσεβεῖ,`
`θανάτῳ θανατωθήσῃ, καὶ ἀποστρέψῃ 15 ἀπὸ τῆς ἁμαρτίας αὐτοῦ,`
`καὶ ποιήσῃ κρῖμα καὶ δικαιοσύνην, καὶ ἐνέχυρον ἀποδῷ, καὶ ἅρπαγμα`
`ἀποτίσει, ἐν προστάγμασι ζωῆς διαπορεύηται, τοῦ μὴ ποιῆσαι ἄδικον,`
`ζωῇ ζήσεται, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἀποθανεῖται. 16 Πᾶσαι αἱ ἁμαρτίαι αὐτοῦ ἃς`
`ἥμαρτεν, οὐ μὴ μνησθῶσιν ἔτι, ὅτι κρῖμα καὶ δικαιοσύνην ἐποίησεν, ἐν`
`αὐτοῖς ζήσεται. 17 Καὶ ἐροῦσιν οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ λαοῦ σου, οὐκ εὐθεῖα ἡ`
`ὁδὸς τοῦ Κυρίου· καὶ αὕτη ἡ ὁδὸς αὐτῶν οὐκ εὐθεῖα. 18 Ἐν τῷ`
`ἀποστρέψαι δίκαιον ἀπὸ τῆς δικαιοσύνης αὐτοῦ, καὶ ποιήσῃ ἀνομίαν,`
`καὶ ἀποθανεῖται ἐν αὐτοῖς. 19 Καὶ ἐν τῷ ἀποστρέψαι τὸν ἁμαρτωλὸν`

**Chapter 33**

**6** ...if the sword come, and take a soul from among them, that soul, for its own iniquity, shall be taken; but its blood will I require at the watchman’s hand.
**7** So thou, son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word from My mouth, and warn them from Me.
**8** When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and if thou speak not to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.
**9** Yet if thou warn the wicked of his way, to turn from it; and if he turn not from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.
**10** Therefore, thou son of man, say unto the house of Israel, Thus ye have spoken, saying, "Our transgressions and our iniquities are upon us, and we waste away in them; how then shall we live?"
**11** Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord Adonai, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his evil way, and live. Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?
**12** Therefore, thou son of man, say unto the children of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression; and as for the wickedness of the wicked, it shall not cause him to fall in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous man be able to be saved in the day of his sin.
**13** When I shall say to the righteous, Thou shalt surely live; if he trust to his own righteousness, and (if) commit iniquity, all his righteous deeds that he hath done shall not be remembered; but in his iniquity that he hath committed, therein shall he die.
**14** And when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die,
**15** And he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right; if he restore the pledge, and give again that which he hath robbed, and walk in the statutes of life, committing no iniquity; he shall surely live, and shall not die.
**16** None of his sins that he hath committed shall be remembered anymore, for he hath done that which is lawful and right; by these shall he live.
**17** Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not equal; and this way of theirs is not equal.
**18** When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, he shall die in them.
**19** And when the wicked turneth...
