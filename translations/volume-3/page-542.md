**Original Text with Light OCR Corrections**

14 Σιὼν, ὅτι ἐν σοὶ εὑρέθησαν αἱ ἀσέβειαι τοῦ Ἰσραήλ. Διὰ τοῦτο
15 δώσεις ἐξαποστελλομένους ἕως κληρονομίας Γέθ, οἴκους ματαίους·
16 εἰς κενὸν ἐγένετο τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν Ἰσραήλ, ἕως τοὺς κληρονόμους
ἀγάγω σοι κατοικοῦσα Λαχεὶς κληρονομία, ἕως Ὀδολλὰμ ἥξει
ἡ δόξα τῆς θυγατρὸς Ἰσραήλ. Ξύρησαι, καὶ κείραι ἐπὶ τὰ τέ-
κνα τὰ τρυφερά σου· ἐμπλάτυνον τὴν χηρείαν σου ὡς ἀετὸς, ὅτι
ἠχμαλωτεύθησαν ἀπὸ σοῦ.

#### Chapter 2

1 ΕΓΕΝΟΝΤΟ λογιζόμενοι κόπους, καὶ ἐργαζόμενοι κακὰ ἐν
ταῖς κοίταις αὐτῶν, καὶ ἅμα τῇ ἡμέρᾳ συνετελοῦν αὐτά· διότι
2 οὐκ ἦραν πρὸς τὸν Θεὸν τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν· καὶ ἐπεθύμουν ἀγροὺς,
καὶ διήρπαζον ὀρφανοὺς, καὶ οἴκους κατεδυνάστευον, καὶ διήρ-
παζον ἄνδρα καὶ τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἄνδρα καὶ τὴν κληρονομί-
3 αν αὐτοῦ. Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Κύριος· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ λογίζομαι ἐπὶ
τὴν φυλὴν ταύτην κακὰ, ἐξ ὧν οὐ μὴ ἄρητε τοὺς τραχήλους ὑμῶν,
4 καὶ οὐ μὴ πορευθῆτε ὀρθοὶ ἐξαίφνης, ὅτι καιρὸς πονηρὸς ἐστιν. Ἐν
τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ληφθήσεται ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς παραβολὴ, καὶ θρηνηθή-
σεται θρῆνος ἐν μέλει, λέγων· ταλαιπωρία ἐταλαιπωρήσαμεν,
μερὶς λαοῦ μου κατεμετρήθη ἐν σχοινίῳ, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ κωλύων
5 αὐτὸν τοῦ ἀποστρέψαι· οἱ ἀγροὶ ἡμῶν διεμερίσθησαν. Διὰ τοῦτο
6 οὐκ ἔσται σοι βάλλων σχοινίον ἐν κλήρῳ ἐν ἐκκλησίᾳ Κυρίου. Μὴ
κλαίετε δάκρυσι, μηδὲ δακρυέτωσαν ἐπὶ τούτοις· οὐ γὰρ ἀπώσε-
7 ται ἐνείδη ὁ λέγων· οἶκος Ἰακὼβ παρώργισε πνεῦμα Κυρίου.
Εἰ ταῦτα τὰ ἐπιτηδεύματα αὐτοῦ ἐστιν; οὐχ οἱ λόγοι αὐτοῦ εἰ-
8 σὶ καλοὶ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὀρθοὶ πεπόρευται; Καὶ ἔμπροσθεν ὁ
λαός μου εἰς ἔχθραν ἀντικατέστη. Κατέναντι τῆς εἰρήνης αὐτοῦ·
τὴν δοράν αὐτοῦ ἐξέδειραν, τοῦ ἀφελέσθαι ἐλπίδα συντριμμόν πο-
9 λέμου, (διὰ τοῦτο) ἡγούμενοι λαοῦ μου ἀπορρίψονται ἐκ τῶν
οἰκιῶν τρυφῆς αὐτῶν, διὰ τὰ πονηρὰ ἐπιτηδεύματα αὐτῶν ἐξώ-
10 σθησαν. Ἐγγίσατε ὄρεσιν αἰωνίοις· ἀνάστηθι καὶ πορεύου, ὅτι οὐκ
ἔστι σοι αὕτη ἡ ἀνάπαυσις ἕνεκεν ἀκαθαρσίας· διεφθάρητε φθορᾷ,
11 κατεδιώχθητε οὐδενὸς διώκοντος· πνεῦμα ἔστησε ψεῦδος, ἐστά-
λαξέ σοι εἰς οἶνον καὶ μέθυσμα· καὶ ἔσται, ἐκ τῆς σταγόνος τοῦ
12 λαοῦ τούτου, συναγόμενος συναχθήσεται Ἰακὼβ σὺν πᾶσιν· ἐκ-

### Micah
#### Chapter 1

**14** Therefore shalt thou give forth those sent unto the inheritance of Gath, [even] vain houses.
**15** It became for nothing for the kings of Israel, until I bring unto thee the heirs, O inhabitant Lachish, [My] inheritance. Until Adullam shall come the glory of the daughter of Israel.
**16** Shave thyself, and cut off thy hair for thy tender children; enlarge thy widowhood as an eagle, for they have been led captive from thee.

#### Chapter 2

**1** Woe unto them that devise mischief, and work evil upon their beds! When the morning is light, they accomplish them, for they lift not up their hands unto God.
**2** And they coveted fields, and plundered orphans, and oppressed houses; yea, they plundered a man and his house, even a man and his inheritance.
**3** Therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, I devise against this tribe evils, from which ye shall not lift up your necks.
**4** And ye shall not walk upright suddenly, for it is an evil time. In that day shall a parable be taken up against you, and a lamentation shall be lamented in a dirge, saying, "With sore affliction have we been afflicted!"
**5** The portion of My people hath been measured by a line, and there was none to hinder him from turning [it back]; our fields have been divided.
**6** Therefore, there shall not be for thee one casting a line by lot in the assembly of the Lord. Weep ye not with tears, neither let them weep for these things; for reproaches shall not be rejected, [saith] he who speaketh:
**7** "The house of Jacob hath provoked the Spirit of the Lord." Are these His practices? Are not His words good with Him, and doth He not walk uprightly?
**8** But erst My people rose up as an enemy. Against His peace, they stripped off his skin, to take away the hope of crushing war.
**9** (Therefore) the leaders of My people shall be cast forth from their houses of delight; for their evil practices they were driven out.
**10** Draw near to everlasting mountains! Arise and depart, for this is not your resting place because of uncleanness; ye are utterly corrupted with corruption,
**11** ye were pursued with none pursuing. A spirit hath established a lie, it hath dropped upon thee for wine and strong drink. And it shall be, from the remnant of this people,
**12** Jacob shall be gathered, being gathered with all [of them];
