1 ΚΑΙ ἐβασίλευσε Σεδεκίας υἱὸς Ἰωσία ἀντὶ Ἰεχονίου υἱοῦ
Ἰωακείμ, ὃν ἐβασίλευσε Ναβουχοδονόσορ βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος,
2 βασιλεύειν τοῦ Ἰούδα, καὶ οὐκ ἤκουσαν αὐτὸς καὶ οἱ παῖδες αὐ-
τοῦ καὶ ὁ λαὸς τῆς γῆς τοὺς λόγους Κυρίου, οὓς ἐλάλησεν ἐν
3 χειρὶ Ἱερεμίου τοῦ προφήτου. Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Σεδε-
κίας τὸν Ἰωάχαλ υἱὸν Σελεμίου, καὶ τὸν Σοφονίαν υἱὸν Μαα-
σαίου τὸν ἱερέα, πρὸς Ἱερεμίαν τὸν προφήτην, λέγων· πρόσευξαι
4 δὴ περὶ ἡμῶν πρὸς Κύριον τὸν Θεὸν ἡμῶν. Καὶ Ἱερεμίας
ἦλθε, καὶ διῆλθεν ἀναμέσον τῆς πόλεως, καὶ οὐκ ἔδωκαν αὐτὸν
5 εἰς οἶκον τῆς φυλακῆς. Καὶ δύναμις Φαραὼ ἐξῆλθεν ἐξ Αἰγύπτου,
καὶ ἤκουσαν οἱ Χαλδαῖοι οἱ πολεμοῦντες τὴν Ἱερουσαλὴμ τὴν
6 ἀκοὴν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἀνέβησαν ἀπὸ Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ ἐγένετο λό-
7 γος Κυρίου πρὸς Ἱερεμίαν τὸν προφήτην, λέγων· οὕτως εἶπε
Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ· οὕτως ἐρεῖς πρὸς βασιλέα Ἰούδα τὸν
ἀποστείλαντα πρὸς σέ, τοῦ ἐκζητῆσαί με· ἰδοὺ δύναμις Φαραὼ
ἡ ἐξελθοῦσα ὑμῖν εἰς βοήθειαν, ἀποστρέψουσιν εἰς γῆν Αἰγύ-
8 πτου, καὶ ἀναστρέψουσιν οἱ Χαλδαῖοι, καὶ πολεμήσουσιν ἐπὶ
τὴν πόλιν ταύτην, καὶ συλλήψονται αὐτήν, καὶ καύσουσιν αὐ-
9 τὴν ἐν πυρί. Ὅτι οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος· μὴ ὑπολάβητε ταῖς ψυ-
χαῖς ὑμῶν, λέγοντες, ἀποτρέχοντες ἀπελεύσονται ἀφ᾽ ἡμῶν οἱ
10 Χαλδαῖοι, ὅτι οὐ μὴ ἀπέλθωσι. Καὶ ἐὰν πατάξητε πᾶσαν δύ-
ναμιν τῶν Χαλδαίων τοὺς πολεμοῦντας ὑμᾶς, καὶ καταλειφθῶσιν
ἐν αὐτοῖς τινες ἐκκεντημένοι, ἕκαστος ἐν τῷ τόπῳ αὐτοῦ, ἔτι
11 αὐτοὶ ἀναστήσονται, καὶ καύσουσι τὴν πόλιν ταύτην ἐν πυρί. Καὶ
ἐγένετο ὅτε ἀνέβη ἡ δύναμις τῶν Χαλδαίων ἀπὸ Ἱερουσαλὴμ
12 ἀπὸ προσώπου τῆς δυνάμεως Φαραώ, ἐξῆλθεν Ἱερεμίας ἀπὸ Ἱε-
ρουσαλὴμ τοῦ πορευθῆναι εἰς γῆν Βενιαμείν, τοῦ ἀγοράσαι ἐ-
13 κεῖθεν ἐν μέσω τοῦ λαοῦ, καὶ ἐγένετο αὐτὸς ἐν πύλῃ Βενιαμείν,
καὶ ἐκεῖ ἄνθρωπος παρ᾿ ᾧ κατέλυσε Σαρουίας υἱὸς Σελεμίου,
υἱοῦ Ἀνανίου, καὶ συνέλαβε τὸν Ἱερεμίαν τὸν προφήτην, λέ-
14 γων· πρὸς τοὺς Χαλδαίους σὺ φεύγεις. Καὶ εἶπε· ψεῦδος, οὐχί
πρὸς τοὺς Χαλδαίους ἐγὼ φεύγω· καὶ οὐκ ἤκουσεν αὐτοῦ· καὶ
συνέλαβε Σαρουίας τὸν Ἱερεμίαν, καὶ εἰσήγαγεν αὐτὸν πρὸς τοὺς

**JEREMIAH 44 (Septuagint) / JEREMIAH 37 (Hebrew)**

**1** And Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, reigned in the stead of Jeconiah, the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, had made king; **2** [Zedekiah then having been set] to reign over Judah. But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, hearkened unto the words of the Lord, which He spake by the hand of Jeremiah the prophet.
**3** And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal, the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah, the son of Maaseiah the priest, unto Jeremiah the prophet, saying, "Pray now for us unto the Lord our God."
**4** And Jeremiah came, and passed through the midst of the city, and they had not [yet] put him into the house of the prison.
**5** And the army of Pharaoh came forth out of Egypt; and when the Chaldeans, who besieged Jerusalem, heard thereof, they departed from Jerusalem.
**6** Then the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah the prophet, saying, **7** "Thus saith the Lord God of Israel: Thus shalt thou say unto the king of Judah, who sent thee unto me to inquire of me: 'Behold, the army of Pharaoh, which is come forth to your aid, shall return to the land of Egypt; **8** and the Chaldeans shall return, and fight against this city, and shall take it, and burn it with fire.'
**9** For thus saith the Lord: 'Deceive not yourselves, saying in your hearts, "The Chaldeans will surely depart from us by fleeing," for they shall not depart; **10** and though ye should smite the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there should be left among them [but] certain wounded men, each in his own place, **11** yet they themselves shall rise up again, and burn this city with fire.' "
**12** And it came to pass, when the army of the Chaldeans was gone up from Jerusalem before the army of Pharaoh, that Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to buy there in the midst of the people. **13** And it came to pass, when he was in the gate of Benjamin, that a man was there; with him Sarvia, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah, lodged; and [Sarvia] laid hold of Jeremiah the prophet, saying, **14** "Thou fleest to the Chaldeans!" Then he said, "It is false! I flee not unto the Chaldeans." But he hearkened not unto him. So Sarvia took Jeremiah, and brought him unto the...
