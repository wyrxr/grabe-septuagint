**ΔΑΝΙΗΛ:**
τὰ βρώματα, καὶ τὸν οἶνον κεράσας θές, καὶ ἀπόκλεισον τὴν θύ-
ραν, καὶ σφράγισον τῷ δακτυλίῳ σου, καὶ ἐλθὼν πρωΐ, ἐὰν μὴ 12
εὕρῃς πάντα βεβρωμένα ὑπὸ τοῦ Βήλ, ἀποθανούμεθα, ἢ Δανιὴλ
ὁ ψευσάμενος καθ᾿ ἡμῶν. Αὐτοὶ δὲ κατεφρόνουν, ὅτι πεποιήκει- 13
σαν ὑπὸ τὴν τράπεζαν κεκρυμμένην εἴσοδον, καὶ δι᾿ αὐτῆς εἰσε-
πορεύοντο διόλου, καὶ ἀνῆλον αὐτά. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἐξῆλθον 14
ἐκεῖνοι, καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς παρέθηκε τὰ βρώματα τῷ Βήλ· καὶ ἐπέ-
ταξε Δανιὴλ τοῖς παιδαρίοις αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἤνεγκαν τέφραν· καὶ κα-
τέσεισαν ὅλον τὸν ναὸν ἐνώπιον τοῦ βασιλέως μόνου· καὶ ἐξελθόν-
τες ἔκλεισαν τὴν θύραν, καὶ ἐσφράγισαν ἐν τῷ δακτυλίῳ τοῦ βα-
σιλέως, καὶ ἀπῆλθον. Οἱ δὲ ἱερεῖς ἦλθον τὴν νύκτα κατὰ τὸ ἔθος 15
αὑτῶν, καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰ τέκνα αὐτῶν, καὶ κατ-
ἔφαγον πάντα καὶ ἐξέπιον. Καὶ ὤρθρισεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τὸ πρωΐ, 16
καὶ Δανιὴλ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς· σῶαι αἱ σφραγῖδες 17
Δανιήλ; ὁ δὲ εἶπε· σῶοι, βασιλεῦ. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἅμα τῷ ἀνοι- 18
ξαι τὰς θύρας, ἐπιβλέψας ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐπὶ τὴν τράπεζαν, ἐβόησε
φωνῇ μεγάλῃ, μέγας εἶ Βήλ, καὶ οὐκ ἔστι παρὰ σοὶ δόλος οὐδὲ
εἷς. Καὶ γελάσας Δανιὴλ ἐκράτησε τὸν βασιλέα, τοῦ μὴ εἰσελ- 19
θεῖν αὐτὸν ἔσω, καὶ εἶπεν· Ἴδε δὴ τὸ ἔδαφος, καὶ γνῶθι, τίνος τὰ
ἴχνη ταῦτα. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς· ὁρῶ τὰ ἴχνη ἀνδρῶν, καὶ 20
γυναικῶν, καὶ παιδίων· καὶ ὀργισθεὶς ὁ βασιλεὺς τότε συνελά- 21
βετο τοὺς ἱερεῖς, καὶ τὰς γυναῖκας, καὶ τὰ τέκνα αὐτῶν, καὶ
ἔδειξαν αὐτῷ τὰς κρυπτὰς θύρας, δι᾿ ὧν εἰσεπορεύοντο, καὶ ἐδά-
πανων τὰ ἐπὶ τῆς τραπέζης. Καὶ ἀπέκτεινεν αὐτοὺς ὁ βασιλεύς, 22
καὶ ἔδωκε τὸν Βὴλ ἔκδοτον τῷ Δανιήλ, καὶ κατέστρεψεν αὐτὸν
καὶ τὸ ἱερὸν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἦν δράκων μέγας ἐν τῷ τόπῳ, καὶ ἐσέ- 23
βοντο αὐτὸν οἱ Βαβυλώνιοι. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τῷ Δανιήλ· 24
Μὴ καὶ τοῦτον ἐρεῖς, ὅτι χαλκοῦς ἐστιν; ἰδοὺ ζῇ, καὶ ἐσθίει, καὶ
πίνει· οὐ δύνασαι εἰπεῖν, ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν οὗτος θεὸς ζῶν, καὶ
προσκύνησον αὐτῷ. Καὶ εἶπε Δανιὴλ· Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ μου προσ- 25
κυνήσω, ὅτι οὗτος ἐστι Θεὸς ζῶν. Σὺ δὲ, βασιλεῦ, δός μοι ἐξου- 26
σίαν, καὶ ἀποκτενῶ τὸν δράκοντα ἄνευ μαχαίρας καὶ ῥάβδου, καὶ
εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς· δίδωμί σοι. Καὶ ἔλαβε Δανιὴλ πίσσαν, καὶ στῆρ, 27
καὶ τρίχας, καὶ ἥψησεν ἐπιτοαυτό· καὶ ἐποίησε μάζας, καὶ ἔδω-
κεν εἰς τὸ στόμα τοῦ δράκοντος, καὶ φαγὼν διερράγη ὁ δράκων,
καὶ εἶπεν· ἰδοὺ τὰ σεβάσματα ὑμῶν. Καὶ ἐγένετο, ὡς ἤκουσαν 28

**Chapter 12**
**Daniel**

**12** the food, and having mixed the wine, do thou set [it]; and shut fast the door, and seal [it] with thy ring. And coming in the morning, if thou find not all consumed by Bel, we shall die, or Daniel who hath lied against us."
**13** But they were confident in their deception, for they had made a hidden entrance beneath the table, and through it they entered continuously, and removed all the provisions.
**14** And it came to pass, when they had gone forth, that the king set the food before Bel; and Daniel commanded his young men, and they brought ashes; and they scattered [the ashes] over all the temple before the king alone. And when they had gone forth, they shut the door, and sealed it with the king's ring, and departed.
**15** But the priests came in the night according to their custom, both their wives and their children, and they ate all and drank up [all].
**16** And the king rose early in the morning, and Daniel with him.
**17** And the king said, "Are the seals [still] intact, Daniel?" And he said, "Intact, O king."
**18** And it came to pass, as soon as the doors were opened, the king, looking upon the table, cried out with a loud voice, "Great art thou, O Bel, and there is no guile at all with thee!"
**19** And Daniel, laughing, withheld the king from entering within, and said, "See now the floor, and know whose are these footprints."
**20** And the king said, "I behold the footprints of men, and of women, and of children."
**21** And the king, being enraged, then arrested the priests, and their wives, and their children; and they showed him the hidden doors, through which they entered, and consumed that which was upon the table.
**22** And the king slew them, and delivered Bel to Daniel, and he overthrew him and his temple.
**23** Now there was a great dragon in that place, and the Babylonians worshipped him.
**24** And the king said unto Daniel, "Wilt thou say also of this one, that he is of bronze? Behold, he liveth, and eateth, and drinketh! Thou canst not say that this one is not a living god, and [therefore] worship him!"
**25** And Daniel said, "I will worship the Lord my God, for this One is the living God."
**26** "But thou, O king, grant me authority, and I shall slay the dragon without sword or staff."
**27** And the king said, "I give [it] unto thee." And Daniel took pitch, and fat, and hairs, and boiled them together; and he made cakes, and gave them into the mouth of the dragon. And when he had eaten, the dragon burst asunder. And he said, "Behold your objects of worship!"
**28** And it came to pass, when they heard
