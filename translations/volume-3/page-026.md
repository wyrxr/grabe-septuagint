**ΨΑΛΜ. ΛϚʹ.**
τοῦ ἐν καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐχ ὑποσκελισθήσεται τὰ διαβήματα
32 αὐτοῦ. Κατανοεῖ ὁ ἁμαρτωλὸς τὸν δίκαιον, καὶ ζητεῖ τοῦ θανατῶσαι αὐτόν·
33 ὁ δὲ Κύριος οὐ μὴ ἐγκαταλίπῃ αὐτὸν εἰς τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ, οὐδ᾽ οὐ μὴ καταδικάσῃ αὐτόν, ὅταν κρίνηται αὐτῷ.
34 Ὑπόμεινον τὸν Κύριον, καὶ φύλαξον τὴν ὁδὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὑψώσει σε τοῦ κατακληρονομῆσαι γῆν· ἐν τῷ ἐξολεθρεύεσθαι ἁμαρτωλούς, ὄψῃ.
35 Εἶδον τὸν ἀσεβῆ ὑπερυψούμενον καὶ ἐπαιρόμενον, ὡς τὰς κέδρους τοῦ Λιβάνου·
36 Καὶ παρῆλθον καὶ ἰδοὺ οὐκ ἦν, καὶ ἐζήτησα αὐτόν, καὶ οὐχ εὑρέθη ὁ τόπος αὐτοῦ.
37 Φύλασσε ἀκακίαν, καὶ ἴδε εὐθύτητα· ὅτι ἐστὶν ἐγκατάλειμμα ἀνθρώπῳ εἰρηνικῷ.
39 Οἱ δὲ παράνομοι ἐξολεθρευθήσονται ἐπιτοαυτό· τὰ ἐγκαταλείμματα τῶν ἀσεβῶν ἐξολεθρευθήσονται.
39 Σωτηρία δὲ τῶν δικαίων παρὰ Κυρίου,
40 καὶ ὑπερασπιστὴς αὐτῶν ἐστιν ἐν καιρῷ θλίψεως· καὶ βοηθήσει αὐτοῖς Κύριος, καὶ ρύσεται αὐτοὺς, καὶ ἐξελεῖται αὐτοὺς ἐξ ἁμαρτωλῶν, καὶ σώσει αὐτοὺς, ὅτι ἤλπισαν ἐπ᾽ αὐτόν.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ΛΖʹ. XXXVII.**

1.2 ΨΑΛΜΟΣ τῷ Δαυίδ, εἰς ἀνάμνησιν περὶ τοῦ Σαββάτου. Κύριε μὴ τῷ θυμῷ σου ἐλέγξῃς με, μηδὲ τῇ ὀργῇ σου παιδεύσῃς με.
3 Ὅτι τὰ βέλη σου ἐνεπάγησάν μοι, καὶ ἐπεστήριξας ἐπ᾽ ἐμὲ τὴν χεῖρά σου·
4 Οὐκ ἔστιν ἴασις ἐν τῇ σαρκί μου ἀπὸ προσώπου τῆς ὀργῆς σου, οὐκ ἔστιν εἰρήνη ἐν τοῖς ὀστέοις μου ἀπὸ προσώπου τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν μου.
5 Ὅτι αἱ ἀνομίαι μου ὑπερῆραν τὴν κεφαλήν μου, ὡσεὶ φορτίον βαρὺ ἐβαρύνθησαν ἐπ᾽ ἐμέ.
6 Προσώζεσαν καὶ ἐσάπησαν οἱ μώλωπές μου, ἀπὸ προσώπου τῆς ἀφροσύνης μου·
7 Ἐταλαιπώρησα καὶ κατεκάμφθην ἕως τέλους, ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν σκυθρωπάζων ἐπορευόμην·
8 Ὅτι αἱ ψόαι μου ἐπλήσθησαν ἐμπαιγμάτων, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἴασις ἐν τῇ σαρκί μου.
9 Ἐκακώθην καὶ ἐταπεινώθην ἕως σφόδρα· ὠρυόμην ἀπὸ στεναγμοῦ τῆς καρδίας μου.
10 Κύριε ἐναντίον σου πᾶσα ἡ ἐπιθυμία μου, καὶ ὁ στεναγμός μου ἀπὸ σοῦ οὐκ ἐκρύβη.
11 Ἡ καρδία μου ἐταράχθη, ἐγκατέλιπέ με ἡ ἰσχύς μου, καὶ τὸ φῶς τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν μου καὶ αὐτὸ οὐκ ἔστι μετ᾽ ἐμοῦ.
12 Οἱ φίλοι μου καὶ οἱ πλησίον μου ἐξ ἐναντίας μου ἤγγισαν καὶ ἔστησαν, καὶ οἱ ἔγγιστά μου ἀπὸ μακρόθεν ἔστησαν·
13 Καὶ ἐξεβιάσαντο οἱ ζητοῦντες τὴν ψυχήν μου, καὶ οἱ ζητοῦντες τὰ κα-

**PSALM XXXVI.**

33 (Cont.) [the law of] his God [is] in his heart; and his steps shall not slide.

34 The sinner watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.
35 But the Lord shall not abandon him into his hands, nor shall He condemn him when he is judged.
36 Wait on the Lord, and keep His way, and He shall exalt thee to inherit the land; when sinners are utterly destroyed, thou shalt see it.
37 I have seen the ungodly exalted and lifted up, as the cedars of Lebanon.
38 And I passed by, and lo, he was not; and I sought him, but his place could not be found.
39 Keep innocence, and behold uprightness; for there is a remnant to the peaceable man.
40 But the lawless shall be utterly destroyed all at once; the remnant of the ungodly shall be utterly destroyed.
41 The salvation of the righteous is from the Lord, and He is their defender in time of trouble. And the Lord shall help them, and deliver them; He shall rescue them from sinners, and save them, because they have hoped in Him.

**PSALM XXXVII.**

1.2 A Psalm of David, for a memorial concerning the Sabbath.
O Lord, rebuke me not in Thine anger, neither chasten me in Thy wrath.
3 For Thine arrows are fixed in me, and Thou hast pressed Thy hand upon me.
4 There is no soundness in my flesh because of the presence of Thy wrath;
There is no peace in my bones because of the presence of my sins.
5 For mine iniquities are gone over my head;
As a heavy burden they are become too heavy for me.
6 My bruises stink and are corrupted, because of my foolishness.
7 I am afflicted and bowed down exceedingly;
All the day long I go mourning.
8 For my loins are filled with mockings, and there is no soundness in my flesh.
9 I am pained and brought very low;
I roared by reason of the groaning of my heart.
10 O Lord, before Thee is all my desire,
And my groaning is not hid from Thee.
11 My heart is troubled, my strength hath forsaken me;
And the light of mine eyes, even it is not with me.
12 My friends and my neighbours drew near against me, and stood;
And my kinsmen stood afar off.
13 And they that sought my soul did violence [to me];
And they that sought [to do] me evil [things]...
