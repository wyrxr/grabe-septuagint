σας τὰς ἀδελφάς σου ἐν πάσαις ταῖς ἀνομίαις σου, αἷς ἐποίησας.
**52** Καὶ σὺ κόμισαι βάσανόν σου, ἐν ᾗ διέφθειρας τὰς ἀδελφάς σου,
ἐν ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις σου, αἷς ἠνόμησας ὑπὲρ αὐτάς, καὶ ἐδικαίω-
σας αὐτὰς ὑπὲρ σεαυτήν· καὶ σὺ αἰσχυνθήτι, καὶ λάβε τὴν ἀτι-
μίαν σου ἐν τῷ δικαιῶσαί σε τὰς ἀδελφάς σου.
**53** Καὶ ἀποστρέφω τὰς ἀποστροφὰς αὐτῶν τὴν ἀποστροφὴν Σοδόμων καὶ τῶν θυγα-
τέρων αὐτῆς· καὶ ἀποστρέψω τὴν ἀποστροφὴν Σαμαρείας καὶ
τῶν θυγατέρων αὐτῆς, καὶ ἀποστρέψω τὴν ἀποστροφήν σου ἐν
μέσῳ αὐτῶν,
**54** ὅπως κομίση τὴν βάσανόν σου, καὶ ἀτιμωθήσῃ ἐκ
πάντων, ὧν ἐποίησας, ἐν τῷ σε παροργίσαι με.
**55** Καὶ ἡ ἀδελφή σου Σόδομα καὶ αἱ θυγατέρες αὐτῆς ἀποκατασταθήσονται, καθὼς
ἦσαν ἀπ᾿ ἀρχῆς· καὶ Σαμάρεια καὶ αἱ θυγατέρες αὐτῆς ἀποκα-
τασταθήσονται, καθὼς ἦσαν ἀπ᾿ ἀρχῆς· καὶ σὺ καὶ αἱ θυγατέρες
σου ἀποκατασταθήσεσθε, καθὼς ἀπ᾿ ἀρχῆς ἦτε.
**56** Καὶ εἰ μὴ ἦν Σόδομα ἡ ἀδελφή σου εἰς ἀκοὴν ἐν τῷ στόματί σου ἐν ταῖς ἡ-
μέραις ὑπερηφανίας σου,
**57** πρὸ τοῦ ἀποκαλυφθῆναι τὰς κακίας σου, ἐν τρόπον νῦν ὄνειδος εἶ θυγατέρων Συρίας καὶ πάντων τῶν κύ-
κλῳ αὐτῆς θυγατέρων ἀλλοφύλων τῶν περιεχουσῶν σε κύκλῳ,
**58** τὰς ἀσεβείας σου καὶ τὰς ἀνομίας σου σὺ κόμισαι αὐτάς, λέγει Κύριος.
**59** Τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναΐ Κύριος· καὶ ποιήσω ἐν σοί, καθὼς ἐποίησας, ὡς ἠτίμασας ταῦτα τοῦ παραβῆναι τὴν διαθήκην μου,
**60** καὶ μνησθήσομαι ἐγὼ τῆς διαθήκης μου τῆς μετὰ σοῦ ἐν ἡμέ-
ραις νηπιότητός σου, καὶ ἀναστήσω σοι διαθήκην αἰώνιον.
**61** Καὶ μνησθήσῃ τὴν ὁδόν σου, καὶ ἀτιμασθήσῃ ἐν τῷ ἀναλαβεῖν σε τὰς
ἀδελφάς σου τὰς πρεσβυτέρας σου σὺν ταῖς νεωτέραις σου, καὶ
δώσω αὐτάς σοι εἰς οἰκοδομήν, καὶ οὐκ ἐκ διαθήκης σου.
**62** Καὶ ἀναστήσω ἐγὼ τὴν διαθήκην μου μετὰ σοῦ, καὶ ἐπιγνώσῃ, ὅτι
ἐγὼ Κύριος,
**63** ὅπως μνησθῇς καὶ αἰσχυνθῇς, καὶ μὴ ᾖ σοι ἔτι ἀνοῖξαι τὸ στόμα ἀπὸ προσώπου ἀτιμίας σου καὶ ἐν τῷ ἐξιλά-
σκεσθαί με σοὶ κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησας, λέγει Ἀδωναΐ Κύριος.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΖʹ. XVII.

**1** ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς μέ, λέγων· υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου,
**2** διήγησαι διήγημα καὶ εἰπὸν παραβολὴν πρὸς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Ἰσραήλ,
**3** καὶ ἐρεῖς· τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναΐ Κύριος· ὁ ἀετὸς ὁ μέγας,

**52** And do thou bear thine own judgment, wherein thou didst corrupt thy sisters, in thy sins wherein thou didst transgress beyond them, and didst justify them beyond thyself; and be thou ashamed, and receive thy dishonor in that thou didst justify thy sisters.
**53** And I will restore their restorations, even the restoration of Sodom and her daughters; and I will restore the restoration of Samaria and her daughters; and I will restore thy restoration in the midst of them,
**54** that thou mayest bear thy judgment, and be dishonored for all things which thou hast committed, in that thou didst provoke Me to wrath.
**55** And thy sister Sodom, she and her daughters, shall be restored, as they were from the beginning; and Samaria, she and her daughters, shall be restored, as they were from the beginning; and thou, and thy daughters, shall be restored, as ye were from the beginning.
**56** For had not Sodom thy sister been a [common] report in thy mouth in the days of thy pride,
**57** before thy wickednesses were uncovered, even in the manner that now thou art a reproach of the daughters of Syria and of all them that are round about her, [and] of the daughters of the Philistines which encompass thee round about,
**58** thy impieties and thy iniquities, do thou bear them, saith the Lord.
**59** Thus saith Adonai the Lord: I will deal with thee as thou hast done, for thou didst despise these things in transgressing My covenant,
**60** yet will I remember My covenant which I made with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish for thee an everlasting covenant.
**61** And thou shalt remember thy ways, and be put to shame, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, both thy elder with thy younger, and I will give them unto thee for a building, yet not by thy covenant.
**62** And I will establish My covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord,
**63** that thou mayest remember and be ashamed, and never again open thy mouth because of thy dishonor, when I shall have made atonement for thee for all that thou hast done, saith Adonai the Lord.
