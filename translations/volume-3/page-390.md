**1** ΚΑὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ τριακοστῷ ἔτει ἐν τῷ τετάρτῳ μηνὶ πέμπτῃ τοῦ μηνός, καὶ ἐγὼ ἤμην ἐν μέσῳ τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας ἐπὶ τοῦ ποταμοῦ τοῦ Χοβάρ· καὶ ἠνοίχθησαν οἱ οὐρανοί, καὶ εἶδον ὁράσεις
**2** Θεοῦ. πέμπτῃ τοῦ μηνός, τοῦτο τὸ ἔτος τὸ πέμπτον τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας τοῦ βασιλέως Ἰωακείμ· καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς Ἰεζεκιὴλ υἱὸν Βουζεί, τὸν ἱερέα ἐν γῇ Χαλδαίων ἐπὶ τοῦ ποταμοῦ τοῦ Χοβάρ.
**3.4** Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐκεῖ ἐπ᾿ ἐμὲ χεὶρ Κυρίου, καὶ ἰδόν, καὶ ἰδοὺ πνεῦμα ἐξαῖρον ἤρχετο ἀπὸ βορρᾶ, καὶ νεφέλη μεγάλη ἐν αὐτῷ, καὶ φέγγος κύκλῳ αὐτοῦ καὶ πῦρ ἐξαστράπτον· καὶ ἐν τῷ μέσῳ αὐτοῦ ὡς ὅρασις ἠλέκτρου ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ πυρός, καὶ φέγγος ἐν αὐτῷ·
**5** καὶ ἐν τῷ μέσῳ ὡς ὁμοίωμα τεσσάρων ζώων·
**6** καὶ αὕτη ἡ ὅρασις αὐτῶν, ὁμοίωμα ἀνθρώπου ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῖς.
**7** Καὶ τέσσαρα πρόσωπα τῷ ἑνί, καὶ τέσσαρες πτέρυγες τῷ ἑνί, καὶ τὰ σκέλη αὐτῶν ὀρθά, καὶ πτερωτοὶ οἱ πόδες αὐτῶν, καὶ σπινθῆρες
**8** ὡς ὁ ἐξαστράπτων χαλκός· καὶ ἐλαφραὶ αἱ πτέρυγες αὐτῶν, καὶ χεὶρ ἀνθρώπου ὑποκάτωθεν τῶν πτερύγων αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τὰ τέσσαρα μέρη αὐτῶν· καὶ τὰ πρόσωπα αὐτῶν, καὶ αἱ πτέρυγες αὐτῶν τῶν τεσσάρων
**9** ἐχόμεναι ἑτέρα τῆς ἑτέρας, καὶ τὰ πρόσωπα αὐτῶν οὐκ ἐπεστρέφοντο ἐν τῷ βαδίζειν αὐτά· ἕκαστον κατέναντι τοῦ προσώπου αὐτῶν ἐπορεύοντο.
**10** Καὶ ἡ ὁμοίωσις τῶν προσώπων αὐτῶν, πρόσωπον ἀνθρώπου αὐτοῖς, καὶ πρόσωπον λέοντος ἐκ δεξιῶν τοῖς τεσσάροις, καὶ πρόσωπον μόσχου ἐξ ἀριστερῶν τοῖς τέσσαρσι,
**11** καὶ πρόσωπον ἀετοῦ τοῖς τέσσαρσι. Καὶ αἱ πτέρυγες αὐτῶν ἐκτεταμέναι ἄνωθεν τοῖς τέσσαρσιν, ἑκατέρῳ δύο συνεζευγμέναι πρὸς ἀλλήλας, καὶ δύο ἐπεκάλυπτον ἐπάνω τοῦ σώματος αὐτῶν,
**12** καὶ ἑκάτερον κατὰ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἐπορεύετο· οὗ ἂν ᾗ τὸ πνεῦμα πορευόμενον ἐπορεύοντο, καὶ οὐκ ἐπέστρεφον.
**13** Καὶ ἐν μέσῳ τῶν ζώων ὅρασις ὡς ἀνθράκων πυρὸς καιομένων, ὡς ὄψις λαμπάδων

**1** And it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth [day] of the month, as I was amidst the captivity by the river Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I beheld visions of God.
**2** On the fifth [day] of the month (which was the fifth year of the captivity of King Jehoiakim), the word of the Lord came unto Ezekiel, the son of Buzi, the priest, in the land of the Chaldeans, by the river Chebar.
**3** And there the hand of the Lord came upon me;
**4** And I beheld, and lo, a mighty wind came from the north, and a great cloud was therein, and a brightness round about it, and a fire flashing forth; and in the midst thereof was an appearance as of electrum in the midst of the fire, and a brightness within it.
**5** And in the midst [of the fire], there was the likeness of four living creatures.
**6** And this was their appearance: the likeness of a man was unto them.
**7** And four faces had each one, and four wings had each one; and their legs were straight, and their feet were winged and sparkling

**9** were joined one to another. And their faces turned not when they went; each one went straight forward.
**10** As for the likeness of their faces, [each had] the face of a man, and the face of a lion on the right side for the four, and the face of an ox on the left side for the four,
**11** and the face of an eagle for the four. And their wings were stretched forth upward for the four; to each one two were joined one to another, and two covered above their body.
**12** And each one went straight forward; whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, and they turned not.
