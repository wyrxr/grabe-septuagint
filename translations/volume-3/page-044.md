**ΨΑΛΤΗΡΙΟΝ.**
982

**ΨΑΛΜ. Ξʹ. LX.**

9 θειαν αὐτοῦ τίς ἐκζητήσει αὐτῶν; Οὕτως ψαλῶ τῷ ὀνόματί σου
εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τοῦ αἰῶνος, τοῦ ἀποδοῦναί με τὰς εὐχάς μου ἡμέ-
ραν ἐξ ἡμέρας.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ΞΑʹ. LXI.**

1.2 Εἰς τὸ τέλος, ὑπὲρ Ἰδιθούν, Ψαλμὸς τῷ Δαυΐδ. Οὐχὶ τῷ
Θεῷ ὑποταγήσεται ἡ ψυχή μου; παρ᾿ αὐτοῦ γὰρ τὸ σωτήριόν μου.
3 Καὶ γὰρ αὐτὸς Θεός μου καὶ σωτήρ μου, ἀντιλήπτωρ μου· οὐ μὴ
4 σαλευθῶ ἔτι πλεῖον. Ἕως πότε ἐπιτίθεσθε ἐπ᾿ ἄνθρωπον; φονεύε-
5 τε πάντες ὑμεῖς, ὡς τοίχῳ κεκλιμένῳ καὶ φραγμῷ ὡσμένῳ. Πλὴν
τὴν τιμήν μου ἐβουλεύσαντο ἀπώσασθαι· ἔδραμον ἐν δίψει· τῷ
στόματι αὐτῶν εὐλόγουν, καὶ τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτῶν κατηρῶντο. Διά-
6 ψαλμα. Πλὴν τῷ Θεῷ ὑποτάγηθι ἡ ψυχή μου· ὅτι παρ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἡ
7 ὑπομονή μου. Ὅτι αὐτὸς Θεός μου καὶ σωτήρ μου, ἀντιλήπτωρ
8 μου· οὐ μὴ μεταναστεύσω. Ἐπὶ τῷ Θεῷ τὸ σωτήριόν μου καὶ ἡ
δόξα μου· ὁ Θεὸς τῆς βοηθείας μου, καὶ ἡ ἐλπίς μου ἐπὶ τῷ
9 Θεῷ. Ἐλπίσατε ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν πᾶσα συναγωγὴ λαοῦ· ἐκχέετε ἐνώ-
πιον αὐτοῦ τὰς καρδίας ὑμῶν· ὅτι ὁ Θεὸς βοηθὸς ἡμῶν. Διάψαλ-
10 μα. Πλὴν μάταιοι οἱ υἱοὶ τῶν ἀνθρώπων, ψευδεῖς οἱ υἱοὶ τῶν ἀν-
θρώπων ἐν ζυγοῖς τοῦ ἀδικῆσαι· αὐτοὶ ἐκ ματαιότητος ἐπιτοαυ-
11 τό. Μὴ ἐλπίζετε ἐπ᾿ ἀδικίαν, καὶ ἐπὶ ἁρπαγμῇ μὴ ἐπιποθεῖτε·
12 πλοῦτος ἐὰν ῥέῃ, μὴ προστίθεσθε καρδίαν. Ἅπαξ ἐλάλησεν ὁ Θεός,
13 δύο ταῦτα ἤκουσα· ὅτι τὸ κράτος τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ σοὶ Κύριε τὸ
ἔλεος· ὅτι σὺ ἀποδώσεις ἑκάστῳ κατὰ τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ΞΒʹ. LXII.**

1 ΨΑΛΜΟΣ τῷ Δαυΐδ, ἐν τῷ εἶναι αὐτὸν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ τῆς
2 Ἰουδαίας. Ὁ Θεὸς ὁ Θεός μου πρὸς σὲ ὀρθρίζω· ἐδίψησέ σοι ἡ
ψυχή μου, ποσαπλῶς σοι ἡ σάρξ μου, ἐν γῇ ἐρήμῳ καὶ ἀβάτῳ
3 καὶ ἀνύδρῳ. Οὕτως ἐν τῷ ἁγίῳ ὤφθην σοι, τοῦ ἰδεῖν τὴν δύναμίν
4 σου καὶ τὴν δόξαν σου. Ὅτι κρεῖσσον τὸ ἔλεός σου ὑπὲρ ζωὰς· τὰ
5 χείλη μου ἐπαινέσουσί σε. Οὕτως εὐλογήσω σε ἐν τῇ ζωῇ μου·
6 ἐν τῷ ὀνόματί σου ἀρῶ τὰς χεῖράς μου. Ὡσεὶ στέατος καὶ πιό-
τητος ἐμπλησθείη ἡ ψυχή μου· καὶ χείλει ἀγαλλιάσεως αἰνέσει τὸ

**PSALM LX.**

9 His mercy and truth;
who among them shall seek [them] out?
Thus will I sing praises to Thy Name
unto the age of ages,
that I may render my vows day by day.

**PSALM LXI.**

1 Unto the End, concerning Jeduthun; A Psalm of David.

2 Shall not my soul be subject unto God?
For from Him cometh my salvation.
3 For He Himself is my God and my Saviour,
my Helper;
I shall not be shaken yet more.
4 How long will ye set upon a man?
Ye all slay [him],
as a leaning wall and a broken fence.
5 Nevertheless, they took counsel
to cast down my honour;
they ran in their thirst;
with their mouth they blessed,
but with their heart they cursed. Selah.

6 Nevertheless, be thou subject unto God, O my soul;
for from Him is my patience.
7 For He Himself is my God and my Saviour,
my Helper;
I shall not be moved.
8 In God is my salvation and my glory;
God is the God of my help,
and my hope is in God.
9 Hope in Him, all ye congregation of the people;
pour out before Him your hearts;
for God is our Helper. Selah.

10 Nevertheless, vain are the sons of men;
false are the sons of men
in scales [for] injustice;
they themselves are altogether vanity.
11 Hope not in unrighteousness,
and covet not robbery;
if wealth flow, set not your heart [upon it].
12 Once hath God spoken,
these two things have I heard:
that the power is God's,
and Thine, O Lord, is mercy;
13 for Thou shalt render unto every man
according to his works.

**PSALM LXII.**

1 A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.

2 O God, my God, unto Thee I rise early;
my soul hath thirsted for Thee,
how manifoldly [yearneth] for Thee my flesh,
in a land desert and untrodden and waterless.
3 Thus in the sanctuary have I appeared before Thee,
to see Thy power and Thy glory.
4 For Thy mercy is better than lives;
my lips shall praise Thee.
5 Thus will I bless Thee in my life;
in Thy Name will I lift up my hands.
6 As with fatness and richness
may my soul be filled;
and with lips of exultation
shall my mouth praise [Thee].
