ΚΕΦ. ΙΓʹ.
**6** λέγει Κύριος, καὶ ὁ Κύριος οὐκ ἀπέσταλκεν αὐτούς, καὶ ἤρξαντο
**7** τοῦ ἀναστῆσαι λόγον. Οὐχὶ ὅρασιν ψευδῆ ἑωράκατε; καὶ μαντείας
**8** ματαίας εἰρήκατε; Καὶ λέγετε, φησὶ Κύριος, καὶ ἐγὼ οὐκ ἐλά-
**9** λησα. Διὰ τοῦτο εἰπόν, τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναΐ Κύριος· ἀνθ᾿ ὧν οἱ λόγοι
**10** ὑμῶν ψευδεῖς, καὶ αἱ μαντεῖαι ὑμῶν μάταιαι, διὰ τοῦτο ἰδοὺ ἐγώ ἐφ᾿
**11** ὑμᾶς, λέγει Ἀδωναΐ Κύριος, καὶ ἐκτενῶ τὴν χεῖρά μου ἐπὶ τοὺς
**12** προφήτας τοὺς ὁρῶντας ψευδῆ καὶ τοὺς ἀποφθεγγομένους μάταια·
**13** ἐν παιδείᾳ τοῦ λαοῦ μου οὐκ ἔσονται, οὐδὲ ἐν γραφῇ οἴκου Ἰσραὴλ
**14** οὐ γραφήσονται, καὶ εἰς τὴν γῆν τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ οὐκ εἰσελεύσονται,
**15** καὶ γνώσονται ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι Ἀδωναΐ Κύριος. Ἀνθ᾿ ὧν ἐπλάνησαν
**16** τὸν λαόν μου, λέγοντες, εἰρήνη, εἰρήνη, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν εἰρήνη, καὶ
**17** οὗτος οἰκοδομεῖ τὸν τοῖχον, καὶ αὐτοὶ ἀλείφουσιν αὐτόν, πεσεῖται·
**18** Εἰπὸν πρὸς τοὺς ἀλείφοντας αὐτόν· πεσεῖται, καὶ ἔσται ὑετὸς κα-
**19** τακλύζων, καὶ δώσω λίθους πετροβόλους εἰς τοὺς ἐνδέσμους αὐτῶν,
**20** καὶ πεσοῦνται, καὶ πνεῦμα ἐξαῖρον, καὶ ῥαγήσεται. Καὶ ἰδοὺ πέπτω-
**21** κεν ὁ τοῖχος, καὶ οὐκ ἐροῦσι πρὸς ὑμᾶς· ποῦ ἐστιν ἡ ἀλοιφὴ ὑμῶν,
**22** ἣν ἠλείψατε; Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναΐ Κύριος· καὶ ῥήξω πνοὴν
**23** ἐξαίρουσαν μετὰ θυμοῦ, καὶ ὑετὸς κατακλύζων ἐν ὀργῇ μου ἔσται·
**24** καὶ τοὺς λίθους τοὺς πετροβόλους ἐπάξω ἐν θυμῷ εἰς συντέλειαν,
**25** καὶ κατασκάψω τὸν τοῖχον, ὃν ἠλείψατε, καὶ πεσεῖται· καὶ θήσω αὐ-
**26** τὸν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, καὶ ἀποκαλυφθήσεται τὰ θεμέλια αὐτοῦ, καὶ πεσεῖ-
**27** ται, καὶ συντελεσθήσεσθε μετ᾿ ἐλέγχων, καὶ ἐπιγνώσεσθε, διότι ἐγώ
**28** Κύριος. Καὶ συντελέσω τὸν θυμόν μου ἐπὶ τὸν τοῖχον, καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς
**29** ἀλείφοντας αὐτόν, καὶ πεσεῖται· καὶ εἶπα πρὸς ὑμᾶς· οὐκ ἔστιν ὁ
**30** τοῖχος, οὐδὲ οἱ ἀλείφοντες αὐτὸν προφῆται τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, οἱ προ-
**31** φητεύοντες ἐπὶ Ἰερουσαλήμ, καὶ οἱ ὁρῶντες αὐτῇ εἰρήνην, καὶ οὐκ
**32** ἔστιν εἰρήνη, λέγει Ἀδωναΐ Κύριος. Καὶ σύ, υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, στήρι-
**33** σον τὸ πρόσωπόν σου ἐπὶ τὰς θυγατέρας τοῦ λαοῦ σου, τὰς προφη-
**34** τευούσας ἀπὸ καρδίας αὐτῶν, καὶ προφήτευσον ἐπ᾿ αὐτάς, καὶ ἐρεῖς
**35** πρὸς αὐτάς· τάδε λέγει Ἀδωναΐ Κύριος· οὐαὶ ταῖς συρραπτού-
**36** σας προσκεφάλαια ἐπὶ πάντα ἀγκῶνα χειρός, καὶ ποιούσαις ἐπι-
**37** βόλαια ἐπὶ πᾶσαν κεφαλὴν πάσης ἡλικίας, τοῦ διαστρέφειν ψυχάς·
**38** καὶ αἱ ψυχαὶ διεστράφησαν τοῦ λαοῦ μου, καὶ ψυχὰς περιεποιοῦντο,
**39** καὶ ἐβεβήλουν με πρὸς τὸν λαόν μου, ἕνεκεν δρακὸς κριθῶν, καὶ
**40** ἕνεκεν κλασμάτων ἄρτου τοῦ ἀποκτεῖναι ψυχάς, ἃς οὐκ ἔδει ἀποθα-

**6** "Thus saith the Lord, when the Lord hath not sent them, and they began to establish a word [of their own].
**7** Have ye not beheld a vision of falsehood? And have ye uttered divinations of vanity?
**8** And ye say, 'Thus saith the Lord!' when I Myself have not spoken.
**9** Therefore, say thou, 'Thus saith Adonai the Lord: Forasmuch as your words are false, and your divinations are vain,
**10** therefore, behold, I am against you,' saith Adonai the Lord, 'and I will stretch forth My hand upon the prophets who behold false [visions], and who speak vain [things].
**11** They shall not be found within the discipline of My people, neither shall their names be inscribed in the roll of the house of Israel.
**12** Neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and they shall know that I am Adonai the Lord.'
**13** Because they have beguiled My people, saying, 'Peace, peace!' when there is no peace.
**14** And [when] one buildeth a wall, and they themselves daub it, it shall surely fall.
**15** Say unto them that daub it: 'It shall surely fall!' And there shall be an overflowing rain, and I will send great hailstones upon their fastenings,
**16** and they shall fall; and a whirlwind shall tear [it], and it shall be broken.
**17** And behold, the wall is fallen! And they shall not say unto you, 'Where is your daubing wherewith ye have daubed [it]?'
**18** Therefore thus saith Adonai the Lord: 'And I will break forth a spirit of whirlwind with My fury, and an overflowing rain shall be in My wrath.
**19** And the hailstones, [even] the stone-throwers, I will bring forth in wrath to consume [it]; and I will dig down the wall which ye have daubed, and it shall fall.
**20** And I will lay it upon the ground, and its foundations shall be laid bare, and it shall fall; and ye shall be utterly consumed with [My] reproofs,
**21** and ye shall know that I am the Lord. And I will bring My wrath to an end upon the wall, and upon those that daub it; and it shall fall.
**22** And I have said unto you: "The wall is no more, nor are those that daub it the prophets of Israel, even the prophets that prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and those that see peace for her, and there is no peace," saith Adonai the Lord.'
**23** And thou, son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, those who prophesy out of their own heart, and prophesy thou against them.
**24** And thou shalt say unto them, 'Thus saith Adonai the Lord: Woe unto them that sew cushions upon every wrist, and make coverings upon every head of every age, to pervert souls!
**25** For the souls of My people have been perverted, and they have gained souls [for themselves]; and they have profaned Me among My people, for a handful of barley and for fragments of bread, to slay souls that ought not to die, and to preserve souls that ought not to live, by your uttering..."
