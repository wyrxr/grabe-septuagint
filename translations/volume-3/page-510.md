**ΔΑΝΙΗΛ**

**ΚΕΦ. ΙΑ΄. ΧΙ.**

**1** Καὶ ἐγὼ ἐν ἔτει πρώτῳ Κύρου ἔστην εἰς κράτος καὶ ἰσχύν.
**2** Καὶ νῦν ἀλήθειαν ἀναγγελῶ σοι˙ ἰδοὺ ἔτι τρεῖς βασιλεῖς ἀναστήσονται ἐν τῇ Περσίδι, καὶ ὁ τέταρτος πλουτήσει πλοῦτον μέγαν παρὰ πάντας˙ καὶ μετὰ τὸ κρατῆσαι αὐτὸν τοῦ πλούτου
**3** αὐτοῦ, ἐπαναστήσεται πάσαις βασιλείαις Ἑλλήνων, καὶ ἀναστήσεται βασιλεὺς δυνατός, καὶ κυριεύσει κυρείας πολλῆς, καὶ ποιήσει κατὰ τὸ θέλημα αὐτοῦ.
**4** Καὶ ὡς ἂν στῇ ἡ βασιλεία αὐτοῦ, συντριβήσεται, καὶ διαιρεθήσεται εἰς τοὺς τέσσαρας ἀνέμους τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ οὐκ εἰς τὰ ἔσχατα αὐτοῦ, οὐδὲ κατὰ τὴν κυρείαν αὐτοῦ, ἣν ἐκυρίευσεν, ὅτι ἐκτιλήσεται ἡ βασιλεία αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἑτέροις ἐκτὸς τούτων δοθήσεται.
**5** Καὶ ἐνισχύσει ὁ βασιλεὺς τοῦ νότου, καὶ ἐνισχύσει ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸν εἷς τῶν ἀρχόντων αὐτοῦ καὶ κυριεύσει κυρείας πολλῆς ἐπ᾽ ἐξουσίας αὐτοῦ˙
**6** καὶ μετὰ τὰ ἔτη αὐτοῦ ἀποσυμπιγήσονται, καὶ ἡ θυγάτηρ βασιλέως τοῦ νότου εἰσελεύσεται πρὸς βασιλέα τοῦ βορρᾶ, τοῦ ποιῆσαι συνθήκας μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐ κρατήσει ἰσχύος βραχίονος, καὶ οὐ στήσεται τὸ σπέρμα αὐτοῦ, καὶ παραδοθήσεται αὕτη, καὶ οἱ φέροντες αὐτήν, καὶ ἡ νεάνις, καὶ ὁ κατισχύων αὐτήν˙
**7** ἐν τοῖς καιροῖς, καὶ ἀναστήσεται ἐκ τοῦ ἄνθους τῆς ῥίζης αὐτῆς, ἐπὶ τῆς ἑτοιμασίας αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἥξει πρὸς τὴν δύναμιν, καὶ εἰσελεύσεται εἰς τὰ ὑποστηρίγματα τοῦ βασιλέως τοῦ βορρᾶ, καὶ ποιήσει ἐν αὐτοῖς, καὶ κατισχύσει.
**8** Καὶ γε τοὺς θεοὺς αὐτῶν καταστρέψει μετὰ τῶν χωνευτῶν αὐτῶν, πᾶν σκεῦος ἐπιθυμητὸν αὐτῶν, ἀργυρίου καὶ χρυσίου, μετὰ αἰχμαλωσίας οἴσει εἰς Αἴγυπτον, καὶ αὐτὸς στήσεται ὑπὲρ βασιλέα τοῦ
**9** βορρᾶ, καὶ εἰσελεύσεται εἰς τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ βασιλέως τοῦ νότου,
**10** καὶ ἀναστρέψει εἰς τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ, καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ συνάξουσιν ὄχλον δυνάμεων πολλῶν, καὶ εἰσελεύσεται ἐρχόμενος καὶ κατακλύζων˙ καὶ παρελεύσεται, καὶ καθιεῖται, καὶ συμπροσπλακήσεται ἕως τῆς ἰσχύος αὐτοῦ.
**11** Καὶ ἀγριανθήσεται βασιλεὺς τοῦ νότου, καὶ ἐξελεύσεται, καὶ πολεμήσει μετὰ βασιλέως τοῦ βορρᾶ, καὶ στήσει
**12** ὄχλον πολύν, καὶ παραδοθήσεται ὁ ὄχλος ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ λήψεται τὸν ὄχλον, καὶ ὑπερυψωθήσεται ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ, καὶ καταβαλεῖ μυριάδας,

**Chapter 11.**

**1** And as for me, in the first year of Cyrus, I stood to be a strength and a might [unto him].
**2** And now will I declare unto thee the truth. Behold, there shall yet arise three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer in great wealth than all [of them]. And after he shall have possessed his wealth,
**3** he shall stir up [himself] against all the kingdoms of the Greeks. And a mighty king shall arise, and he shall rule with much dominion, and shall do according to his will.
**4** And when his kingdom shall stand, it shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven, yet not to his posterity, nor according to the dominion by which he ruled. For his kingdom shall be plucked up, and shall be given unto others besides these.
**5** And the king of the South shall be strong; and one of his princes shall also be strong, [even] over him, and shall rule with much dominion by his own authority.
**6** And after a course of years, they shall join themselves together. And the daughter of the king of the South shall come to the king of the North to make an agreement with him. But she shall not retain the strength of [her] arm; neither shall her seed stand. But she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and the maiden, and he that had strengthened her.
**7** In those times, one shall arise from the flower of her root in his own stead; and he shall come with an army, and shall enter into the strongholds of the king of the North, and shall deal with them, and shall prevail.
**8** And indeed, he shall overthrow their gods, with their molten images, and all their desirable vessels of silver and of gold, with captives, shall he carry into Egypt. And he himself shall stand [in power] longer than the king of the North.
**9** And he shall enter into the kingdom of the king of the South, and shall return unto his own land.
**10** But his sons shall gather a multitude of many forces. And he shall come, entering and overwhelming, and shall pass through. Yea, he shall encamp, and shall engage [in battle], even unto his own stronghold.
**11** And the king of the South shall be moved to fierce anger, and he shall go forth and shall fight with the king of the North. And he shall set forth a great multitude;
**12** and that multitude shall be delivered into his hand. And he shall take the multitude, and his heart shall be lifted up, and he shall cast down [many] myriads,
