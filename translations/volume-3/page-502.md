**6** πολλάς. Ὀπίσω τούτου ἐθεώρουν· καὶ ἰδοὺ θηρίον ἕτερον ὡσεὶ πάρδαλις· καὶ αὐτῇ πτερὰ τέσσαρα πετεινοῦ ὑπεράνω αὐτῆς, καὶ τέσσαρες κεφαλαὶ τῷ θηρίῳ, καὶ ἐξουσία ἐδόθη αὐτῇ.
**7** Ὀπίσω τούτου ἐθεώρουν· καὶ ἰδοὺ θηρίον τέταρτον φοβερὸν καὶ ἔκθαμβον, καὶ ἰσχυρὸν περισσῶς (παρὰ πάντα τὰ θηρία τὰ ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ, καὶ κέρατα δέκα αὐτῷ·) καὶ οἱ ὀδόντες αὐτοῦ σιδηροῖ μεγάλοι, ἐσθίον, καὶ λεπτύνον, καὶ τὰ ἐπίλοιπα τοῖς ποσὶν αὐτοῦ συνεπάτει, καὶ αὐτὸ διάφορον περισσῶς παρὰ πάντα τὰ θηρία τὰ ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ· καὶ δέκα κέρατα αὐτῷ.
**8** Προσενοῦν τοῖς κέρασιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἰδοὺ κέρας ἕτερον μικρὸν ἀνέβη ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῶν, καὶ τρία κέρατα τῶν ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ ἐξεριζώθη ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἰδοὺ ὀφθαλμοί, ὡσεὶ ὀφθαλμοὶ ἀνθρώπου ἐν τῷ κέρατι τούτῳ, καὶ στόμα λαλοῦν μεγάλα.
**9** Ἐθεώρουν ἕως ὅτου θρόνοι ἐτέθησαν, καὶ παλαιὸς ἡμερῶν ἐκάθητο, καὶ τὸ ἔνδυμα αὐτοῦ ὡσεὶ χιὼν λευκόν, καὶ ἡ θρὶξ τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ ὡσεὶ ἔριον καθαρόν, ὁ θρόνος αὐτοῦ φλὸξ πυρός, οἱ τροχοὶ αὐτοῦ πῦρ φλέγον.
**10** Ποταμὸς πυρὸς ἐκπορευόμενος εἵλκεν ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ· χίλιαι χιλιάδες ἐλειτούργουν αὐτῷ, καὶ μύριαι μυριάδες παρειστήκεισαν αὐτῷ· κριτήριον ἐκάθισε, καὶ βίβλοι ἠνεώχθησαν.
**11** Ἐθεώρουν οὖν τότε ἀπὸ φωνῆς τῶν λόγων τῶν μεγάλων, ὧν τὸ κέρας ἐκεῖνο ἐλάλει, ἕως τὸ θηρίον ἐκεῖνο ἀνηρέθη, καὶ ἀπώλετο, καὶ τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ ἐδόθη εἰς καῦσιν πυρός.
**12** Καὶ τῶν λοιπῶν θηρίων ἡ ἀρχὴ μετεστάθη, καὶ μακρότης ζωῆς ἐδόθη αὐτοῖς ἕως καιροῦ καὶ καιροῦ.
**13** Ἐθεώρουν ἐν ὁράματι τῆς νυκτός, καὶ ἰδοὺ μετὰ τῶν νεφελῶν τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, ὡς υἱὸς ἀνθρώπου ἐρχόμενος ἦν, καὶ ἕως τοῦ παλαιοῦ τῶν ἡμερῶν ἔφθασε, καὶ ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ προσήγαγον αὐτόν·
**14** καὶ αὐτῷ ἐδόθη ἀρχὴ καὶ ἡ τιμὴ καὶ ἡ βασιλεία, καὶ πάντες οἱ λαοί, φυλαί, καὶ γλῶσσαι αὐτῷ δουλεύσουσιν· ἡ ἐξουσία αὐτοῦ, ἐξουσία αἰώνιος, ἥτις οὐ παρελεύσεται, καὶ ἡ βασιλεία αὐτοῦ, οὐ διαφθαρήσεται.
**15** Ἔφριξε τὸ πνεῦμά μου ἐν τῇ ἔξει μου, ἐγὼ Δανιήλ, καὶ αἱ ὁράσεις τῆς κεφαλῆς μου ἐτάρασσόν με.
**16** Καὶ προσῆλθον ἑνὶ τῶν ἑστηκότων, καὶ τὴν ἀκρίβειαν ἐζήτουν παρ᾿ αὐτοῦ μαθεῖν περὶ πάντων τούτων· καὶ εἶπέ μοι τὴν ἀκρίβειαν, καὶ τὴν σύγκρισιν τῶν λόγων ἐγνώρισέ μοι.
**17** Ταῦτα τὰ θηρία τὰ μεγάλα τὰ τέσσαρα, τέσσαρες βασιλεῖαι ἀναστήσονται ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς.
**18** Αἳ ἀρθήσονται, καὶ παραλήψονται τὴν βασιλείαν ἅγιοι ὑψίστου, καὶ καθέζουσιν

**7** After this I beheld, and, behold, a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and exceedingly strong (beyond all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns:); and its teeth were great [teeth] of iron, devouring and crushing, and the remainder it trampled with its feet. And it was exceedingly diverse from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns.
**8** As I considered the horns thereof, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, and three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots from before it; and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.
