**31** σοφία, οὐκ ἔστιν ἀνδρεία, οὐκ ἔστι βουλὴ πρὸς τὸν ἀσεβῆ. Ἵππος ἑτοιμάζεται εἰς ἡμέραν πολέμου· παρὰ δὲ Κυρίου ἡ βοήθεια.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΒʹ. XXII.

**1** ΑΙΡΕΤΩΤΕΡΟΝ ὄνομα καλὸν ἢ πλοῦτος πολύς, ὑπὲρ δὲ ἀργύριον καὶ χρυσίον χάρις ἀγαθή.
**2** Πλούσιος καὶ πτωχὸς συνήντησαν ἀλλήλοις· ἀμφοτέρους δὲ ὁ Κύριος ἐποίησε.
**3** Πανοῦργος ἰδὼν πονηρὸν τιμωρούμενον κραταιῶς, αὐτὸς παιδεύεται· οἱ δὲ ἄφρονες παρελθόντες ἐζημιώθησαν.
**4** Γενεὰ σοφίας φόβος Κυρίου, καὶ πλοῦτος, καὶ δόξα, καὶ ζωή.
**5** Τρίβολοι καὶ παγίδες ἐν ὁδοῖς σκολιαῖς· ὁ δὲ φυλάσσων τὴν ἑαυτοῦ ψυχήν, ἀφέξεται αὐτῶν.
**6** Ἐγκαινισμὸς νέου κατὰ τὴν ὁδὸν αὐτοῦ, καίγε ὅταν γηράσῃ, οὐκ ἀποστήσεται ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ.
**7** Πλούσιοι πτωχῶν ἄρξουσι· καὶ οἰκέται ἰδίοις δεσπόταις δανεισῦσιν.
**8** Ὁ σπείρων φαῦλα, θερίσει κακά· πληγὴν δὲ ἔργων αὐτοῦ συντελέσει. Ἄνδρα ἱλαρὸν καὶ δότην ἀγαπᾷ ὁ Θεός· ματαιότητα δὲ ἔργων αὐτοῦ συντελέσει.
**9** Ὁ ἐλεῶν πτωχόν, αὐτὸς διατραφήσεται· τῶν γὰρ ἑαυτοῦ ἄρτων δέδωκε τῷ πτωχῷ. Νίκην καὶ τιμὴν περιποιεῖται ὁ δῶρα διδούς· τὴν μέν τοι ψυχὴν ἀφαιρεῖται τῶν κεκτημένων.
**10** Ἔκβαλε ἐκ συνεδρίου λοιμόν, καὶ συνεξελεύσεται αὐτῷ νεῖκος· ὅταν γὰρ καθίσῃ ἐν συνεδρίῳ, πάντας ἀτιμάζει.
**11** Ἀγαπᾷ Κύριος ὁσίας καρδίας, δεκτοὶ δὲ αὐτῷ πάντες ἄμωμοι· χείλεσι ποιμαίνει βασιλεύς.
**12** Οἱ δὲ ὀφθαλμοὶ Κυρίου διατηροῦσιν αἴσθησιν· φαυλίζει δὲ λόγους παρανόμος.
**13** Προφασίζεται καὶ λέγει ὀκνηρός· λέων ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς, ἐν δὲ ταῖς πλατείαις φονευταί.
**14** Βόθρος βαθὺς στόμα παρανόμου· ὁ δὲ μισηθεὶς ὑπὸ Κυρίου, ἐμπεσεῖται εἰς αὐτόν.
**15** Ἄνοια ἐξῆπται καρδία νέου· ῥάβδος δὲ καὶ παιδεία μακρὰν ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ.
**16** Ὁ συκοφαντῶν πένητα, πολλὰ ποιεῖ τὰ ἑαυτοῦ (κακά)· δίδωσι δὲ πλουσίῳ ἐπ᾿ ἐλάσσονι.
**17** Λόγοις σοφῶν παράβαλε σὺν οὖς, καὶ ἄκουε ἐμὸν λόγον· τὴν δὲ σὴν καρδίαν ἐπίστησον, ἵνα γνῶς ὅτι καλοί εἰσιν.
**18** Καὶ ἐὰν ἐμβάλῃς αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν καρδίαν σου, εὐφρανοῦσί σε ἅμα ἐπὶ σοῖς χείλεσιν·
**19** ἵνα σου γένηται ἐπὶ Κύριον ἡ ἐλπίς, καὶ γνωρίσῃ σοι τὴν ὁδὸν αὐτοῦ.
**20** Καὶ σὺ δὲ ἀπόγραψε αὐτὰ σεαυτῷ τρισσῶς, εἰς βουλὴν καὶ γνῶσιν (ἐπὶ τὸ πλάτος τῆς καρδίας σου).

**CHAPTER XXI.**

**31** [There is] no wisdom, nor is there valor, nor is there counsel, [that may avail] unto the ungodly man. The horse is prepared for the day of battle; but from the Lord cometh the help.

**CHAPTER XXII.**

**1** A good name is more to be chosen than great riches, and good favor is better than silver and gold.
**2** The rich and the poor have met together; the Lord hath made them both.
**3** A shrewd man, seeing the wicked one strongly punished, himself receiveth instruction; but the foolish, passing onward, are harmed.
**4** The generation of wisdom is the fear of the Lord, and riches, and glory, and life.
**5** Thorns and snares are in crooked ways; but he that keepeth his soul shall keep himself far from them.
**6** Train up a child in his own way, and even when he is old, he shall not depart from it.
**7** The rich shall rule over the poor; and household servants shall lend unto their own masters.
**8** He that soweth evil, shall reap evils; and he shall bring to completion the stroke of his own works. A cheerful man and a giver doth God love; yet he shall bring to completion the vanity of his [own] works.
**9** He that pitieth the poor, he himself shall be nourished; for of his own bread hath he given unto the poor. He that giveth gifts doth procure victory and honour; but the soul of them that possess [them] doth he take away.
**10** Cast out the pestilent man from the assembly, and strife shall go forth with him; for when he sitteth in the assembly, he dishonoureth all.
**11** The Lord loveth holy hearts, and all blameless ones are acceptable unto Him; a king doth shepherd with [his] lips.
**12** But the eyes of the Lord do preserve understanding; yet the lawless one doth make vile his words.
**13** The sluggard doth feign [excuses] and saith: "There is a lion in the ways, and murderers in the broad streets."
**14** A deep pit is the mouth of the lawless man; but he that is hated by the Lord shall fall therein.
**15** Folly is bound unto the heart of a young man; but the rod and instruction are far from him.
**16** He that doth oppress the poor, multiplieth his own [evil] deeds; but he that giveth to the rich, [giveth] for less.
**17** Incline thine ear unto the words of the wise, and hearken unto my word; and apply thine heart, that thou mayest know that they are good.
**18** And if thou shalt lay them up in thine heart, they shall rejoice thee, even upon thy lips;
**19** that thy hope may be in the Lord, and that He may make known unto thee His way.
**20** And thou, do thou write them down unto thyself threefold, for counsel and for knowledge (upon the breadth of thy heart).
