ΚΕΦ. ΜΓ΄. Η Σ Α Ι Α Σ 1182
**20** Εὐλογήσει με τὰ θηρία τοῦ ἀγροῦ, σειρῆνες, καὶ στρουθῶν, ὅτι ἔδωκα ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ ὕδωρ, καὶ ποταμοὺς ἐν τῇ ἀνύδρῳ,
**21** ποτίσαι τὸ γένος μου τὸ ἐκλεκτόν, λαόν μου, ὃν περιεποιησάμην,
**22** τὰς ἀρετάς μου διηγεῖσθαι. Οὐ νῦν ἐκάλεσά σε Ἰακώβ, οὐ κοπιάσαι σε ἐποίησα Ἰσραήλ,
**23** οὐκ ἤνεγκας ἐμοὶ πρόβατα τῆς ὁλοκαρπώσεώς σου, οὐδὲ ἐν ταῖς θυσίαις σου ἐδόξασάς με, οὐκ
ἐδούλωσά σε ἐν ταῖς θυσίαις σου, οὐδὲ ἔγκοπον ἐποίησά σε ἐν
**24** Λιβάνῳ, οὐδὲ ἐκτήσω μοι ἀργυρίου θυμίαμα, οὐδὲ στέαρ τῶν
θυσίῶν σου ἐπεθύμησα, ἀλλὰ ἐν ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις σου καὶ ἐν ταῖς
ἀδικίαις σου προέστης μου.
**25** Ἐγώ εἰμι, ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ ἐξαλείφων
τὰς ἀνομίας σου ἕνεκεν ἐμοῦ, καὶ οὐ μνησθήσομαι τὰς ἁμαρτίας
σου.
**26** Σὺ δὲ μνήσθητι, καὶ κριθῶμεν˙ λέγε σὺ τὰς ἀνομίας σου
πρῶτος, ἵνα δικαιωθῇς.
**27** Οἱ πατέρες ὑμῶν πρῶτοι, καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες ὑμῶν ἠνόμησαν εἰς ἐμέ.
**28** Καὶ ἐμίαναν οἱ ἄρχοντες τὰ
ἁγιά μου, καὶ ἔδωκα ἀπολέσαι Ἰακώβ, καὶ Ἰσραὴλ εἰς ὀνειδισμόν.

ΚΕΦ. ΜΔ΄. XLIV.

**1** ΝΥΝ δὲ ἄκουσον, παῖς μου Ἰακώβ, καὶ Ἰσραήλ, ὃν ἐξελεξάμην.
**2** Οὕτως λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὁ ποιήσας σε, καὶ ὁ πλάσας ἐκ κοιλίας, ἔτι βοηθήσῃ˙ μὴ φοβοῦ, παῖς μου Ἰακώβ, καὶ
ὁ ἠγαπημένος Ἰσραήλ, ὃν ἐξελεξάμην.
**3** Ὅτι ἐγὼ δώσω ὕδωρ
ἐν δίψει τοῖς πορευομένοις ἐν ἀνύδρῳ, ἐπιθήσω τὸ πνεῦμά μου
ἐπὶ τὸ σπέρμα σου, καὶ τὰς εὐλογίας μου ἐπὶ τὰ τέκνα σου,
**4** καὶ ἀνατελοῦσιν ὡσεὶ χόρτος ἀναμέσον ὕδατος, καὶ ὡς ἰτέα
ἐπὶ παραρέον ὕδωρ.
**5** Οὗτος ἐρεῖ, τοῦ Θεοῦ εἰμι, καὶ οὗτος βοήσεται ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι Ἰακώβ, καὶ ἕτερος ἐπιγράψει χειρὶ αὑτοῦ, τοῦ Θεοῦ εἰμι, καὶ ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι Ἰσραὴλ βοήσεται.
**6** Οὕτως λέγει ὁ Θεὸς ὁ βασιλεὺς τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ὁ ῥυσάμενος αὐτὸν Θεὸς Σαβαώθ˙ ἐγὼ πρῶτος, καὶ ἐγὼ μετὰ ταῦτα, καὶ
πλὴν ἐμοῦ οὐκ ἔστι Θεός.
**7** Τίς ὥσπερ ἐγώ, στήτω, καλεσάτω,
καὶ ἀναγγειλάτω, καὶ ἑτοιμασάτω μοι, ἀφ᾿ οὗ ἐποίησα ἄνθρωπον εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, καὶ τὰ ἐπερχόμενα πρὸ τοῦ ἐλθεῖν ἀναγγειλάτωσαν ὑμῖν.
**8** Μὴ παρακαλύπτεσθε, μηδὲ πλανᾶσθε˙ οὐκ ἀπ᾿
ἀρχῆς ἡνωτίσασθε, καὶ ἀπήγγειλα ὑμῖν;
**9** μάρτυρες ὑμεῖς ἐστε,
εἰ ἔστι Θεὸς πλὴν ἐμοῦ˙ καὶ οὐκ ἦσαν τότε οἱ πλάσσοντες,

#### Chapter 43

**20** The beasts of the field shall praise Me,
    the jackals, and the daughters of ostriches,
    because I have given water in the wilderness,
    and rivers in the dry land;
**21** To give drink unto My chosen race,
    My people, whom I have acquired,
    that they might declare My excellencies.
**22** Not now have I called thee, O Jacob,
    neither have I caused thee to toil, O Israel.
**23** Thou hast not brought Me sheep for thy burnt offering,
    nor with thy sacrifices hast thou glorified Me.
    I have not enslaved thee with thy sacrifices,
    neither have I made thee weary with frankincense,
**24** nor hast thou purchased for Me incense with silver,
    nor have I desired the fat of thy sacrifices;
    but with thy sins and with thy iniquities
    thou hast defied Me.
**25** "I am He, I am He that blot out
    thy transgressions for My own sake,
    and I will not remember thy sins.
**26** But do thou remember, and let us contend.
    Declare thou first thy iniquities,
    that thou mayest be justified."
**27** Your first fathers, and your rulers,
    they transgressed against Me.
**28** And the rulers defiled My holy things,
    and I gave Jacob over to destruction,
    and Israel unto reproach.

#### Chapter 44

**1** Yet now, hearken, O Jacob My servant,
    and Israel, whom I have chosen.
**2** Thus saith the Lord God,
    He that hath made thee, and He that hath formed thee from the womb:
    Thou shalt yet be helped.
    Fear thou not, O Jacob My servant,
    and Israel, My beloved, whom I have chosen.
**3** For I will give water in the thirst
    to those that walk in the dry land;
    I will pour My Spirit upon thy seed,
    and My blessings upon thy children.
**4** And they shall spring up like grass amidst water,
    and as a willow tree by flowing water.
**5** One shall say, "I am of God,"
    and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob,
    and another shall write with his hand, "I am of God,"
    and shall call himself by the name of Israel.
**6** Thus saith the Lord God,
    the King of Israel,
    and the God of Sabaoth, His Redeemer:
    "I am the first, and I am after these things,
    and besides Me there is no God.
**7** Who is like unto Me?
    Let him stand, let him call forth,
    and let him declare, and let him prepare for Me,
    from the time I made man for eternity;
    and let them declare unto you the things that are coming,
    before they come.
**8** Be ye not veiled, neither be ye led astray;
    have ye not hearkened from the beginning,
    and have I not declared [it] unto you?
**9** Ye are My witnesses, if there be a God besides Me;
    and then were there not those who fashioned [idols]..."
