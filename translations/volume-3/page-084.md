25 ἔργα Κυρίου, καὶ τὰ θαυμάσια αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ βυθῷ. Εἶπε καὶ ἔστη
26 πνεῦμα καταιγίδος, καὶ ὑψώθη τὰ κύματα αὐτῆς· ἀναβαίνουσιν
27 ἕως τῶν οὐρανῶν, καὶ καταβαίνουσιν ἕως ἀβύσσων· ἡ ψυχὴ αὐτῶν ἐν κακοῖς ἐτήκετο· ἐταράχθησαν, ἐσαλεύθησαν ὡς με-
28 θύων, καὶ πᾶσα ἡ σοφία αὐτῶν κατεπόθη. Καὶ ἐκέκραξαν πρὸς
   Κύριον ἐν τῷ θλίβεσθαι αὐτούς, καὶ ἐκ τῶν ἀναγκῶν αὐτῶν ἐξ-
29 ἤγαγεν αὐτούς· καὶ ἐπέταξε τῇ καταιγίδι, καὶ ἔστη εἰς αὔραν,
30 καὶ ἐσίγησαν τὰ κύματα αὐτῆς. Καὶ ηὐφράνθησαν, ὅτι ἡσύγα-
31 σαν, καὶ ὡδήγησεν αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ λιμένα θελήματος αὐτῶν. Ἐξομολο-
32 γησάσθωσαν τῷ Κυρίῳ τὰ ἐλέη αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰ θαυμάσια αὐτοῦ
   τοῖς υἱοῖς τῶν ἀνθρώπων· καὶ ὑψωσάτωσαν αὐτὸν ἐν ἐκκλησίᾳ λαοῦ,
33 καὶ ἐν καθέδρᾳ πρεσβυτέρων αἰνεσάτωσαν αὐτόν. Ἔθετο ποταμοὺς
34 εἰς ἔρημον, καὶ διεξόδους ὑδάτων εἰς δίψαν, γῆν καρποφόρον εἰς
35 ἅλμην, ἀπὸ κακίας τῶν κατοικούντων ἐν αὐτῇ. Ἔθετο ἔρημον εἰς
36 λίμνας ὑδάτων, καὶ γῆν ἄνυδρον εἰς διεξόδους ὑδάτων· καὶ κατ-
37 ῴκισεν ἐκεῖ πεινῶντας, καὶ συνεστήσαντο πόλιν κατοικεσίας· καὶ
   ἔσπειραν ἀγρούς, καὶ ἐφύτευσαν ἀμπελῶνας, καὶ ἐποίησαν καρπὸν
38 γενήματος. Καὶ εὐλόγησεν αὐτοὺς, καὶ ἐπληθύνθησαν σφόδρα, καὶ
39 τὰ κτήνη αὐτῶν οὐκ ἐσμίκρυνε. Καὶ ὠλιγώθησαν, καὶ ἐκακώθη-
40 σαν ἀπὸ θλίψεως κακῶν καὶ ὀδύνης· ἐξεχύθη ἐξουδένωσις ἐπ᾽ ἄρ-
   χοντας (αὐτῶν), καὶ ἐπλάνησεν αὐτοὺς ἐν ἀβάτῳ καὶ οὐχ ὁδῷ.
41 Καὶ ἐβοήθησε πέννητι ἐκ πτωχείας, καὶ ἔθετο ὡς πρόβατα πατριὰς·
42 Ὄψονται εὐθεῖς καὶ εὐφρανθήσονται· καὶ πᾶσα ἀνομία ἐμφράξει
43 στόμα αὐτῆς. Τίς σοφὸς καὶ φυλάξει ταῦτα; καὶ συνήσουσι τὰ
   ἐλέη τοῦ Κυρίου.

1.2 ὨΔΗ ψαλμοῦ τῷ Δαυίδ. Ἑτοίμη ἡ καρδία μου ὁ Θεός, ἑτοί-
3 μη ἡ καρδία μου· ᾄσομαι καὶ ψαλῶ ἐν τῇ δόξῃ μου. Ἐξεγέρθητι
4 ψαλτήριον καὶ κιθάρα· ἐξεγερθήσομαι ὄρθρου. Ἐξομολογήσομαί
5 σοι ἐν λαοῖς Κύριε, καὶ ψαλῶ σοι ἐν ἔθνεσιν· ὅτι μέγα ἐπάνω
   τῶν οὐρανῶν τὸ ἔλεός σου, καὶ ἕως τῶν νεφελῶν ἡ ἀλήθειά σου.
6 Ὑψώθητι ἐπὶ τοὺς οὐρανοὺς ὁ Θεός, καὶ ἐπὶ πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν ἡ δό-
7 ξα σου. Ὄπως ἂν ῥυσθῶσιν οἱ ἀγαπητοί σου, σῶσον τῇ δεξιᾷ σου,

25 The works of the Lord,
    And His wonders in the deep.
26 He spake, and there arose a stormy wind,
    And the waves thereof were lifted up.
27 They ascended unto the heavens,
    And descended unto the abysses;
    Their soul melted within them in troubles;
    They were troubled, they reeled as a drunken man,
    And all their wisdom was swallowed up.
28 Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble,
    And out of their distresses did He lead them forth.
29 And He commanded the storm, and it became a calm,
30 And the waves thereof were still.
    Then were they glad, because they were quieted,
    And He guided them unto their desired haven.
31 Oh, let them give thanks unto the Lord for His mercies,
    And for His wondrous works to the children of men;
32 And let them exalt Him in the congregation of the people,
    And praise Him in the seat of the elders.
33 He turneth rivers into a wilderness,
    And the springs of water into a thirsty land,
34 A fruitful land into a salt marsh,
    Because of the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
35 He turneth a wilderness into pools of water,
    And a dry land into springs of water.
36 And there He setteth the hungry,
    That they may establish a city for habitation;
37 And they sow fields, and plant vineyards,
    And make a harvest of fruit.
38 And He blessed them, and they multiplied exceedingly,
    And He diminished not their livestock.
39 Again, they were diminished,
    And brought low through affliction, through evils and pain.
40 Contempt was poured upon their princes,
    And He caused them to wander in a trackless and pathless place.
41 And He helped the poor out of poverty,
    And made them families like a flock.
42 The upright shall see [it] and rejoice,
    And all iniquity shall stop her mouth.
43 Whoso is wise and will observe these things,
    Even they shall understand the mercies of the Lord.

**PSALM CVII.**

**A Song [or] Psalm of David.**
1 My heart is ready, O God, my heart is ready;
    I will sing and give praise with my glory.
2 Awake, psaltery and harp;
    I myself will awake early.
3 I will give thanks unto Thee, O Lord, among the peoples,
    And I will sing praises unto Thee among the nations.
4 For Thy mercy is great above the heavens,
    And Thy truth reacheth unto the clouds.
5 Be Thou exalted, O God, above the heavens,
    And Thy glory over all the earth.
6 That Thy beloved may be delivered,
    Save [them] by Thy right hand, and hearken unto me.
7 God hath spoken in His sanctuary:
    I will be exalted,
