20 σιάζοντας τοὺς ὄντας ἐν τῇ πόλει· ὅτι ἄνθρωπος οὐκ ἔστι δίκαιος
21 ἐν τῇ γῇ, ὃς ποιήσει ἀγαθὸν καὶ οὐχ ἁμαρτήσεται· καὶ γε εἰς
πάντας τοὺς λόγους οὓς λαλήσουσιν, μὴ τῆς καρδίαν σου, ὅπως μὴ
ἀκούσῃς τοῦ δούλου σου καταρωμένου σε·
22 ἔτι πλειστάκις πονηρεύσεταί σε, καὶ καθέδους πολλὰς κακώσει
καρδίαν σου, ὅπως καί γε σὺ κατηράσω ἑτέρους.
23 Πάντα ταῦτα ἐπείρασα ἐν τῇ σοφίᾳ· εἶπα, σοφισθήσομαι·
24 καὶ αὕτη ἐμακρύνθη ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ μακρὰν ὑπὲρ ὃ ἦν· καὶ βαθὺ βάθος,
τίς εὑρήσει αὐτό;
25 ᾿Εκύκλωσα ἐγὼ καὶ ἡ καρδία μου τοῦ γνῶναι καὶ τοῦ κατασκέψασθαι
καὶ τοῦ ζητῆσαι σοφίαν καὶ ψῆφον, καὶ τοῦ γνῶναι ἀσεβοῦς
ἀφροσύνην καὶ σκληρίαν καὶ παραφροράν·
26 καὶ εὑρίσκω ἐγὼ αὐτὴν πικρότερον ὑπὲρ θάνατον, σὺν τὴν γυναῖκα
ἥτις ἐστὶ θηρεύματα, καὶ σαγῆναι καρδία αὐτῆς, δεσμοί εἰσι χεῖρες
αὐτῆς·
27 ἀγαθὸς πρὸ προσώπου τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐξαιρεθήσεται ἀπ᾿ αὐτῆς. Καὶ
ἁμαρτάνων συλληφθήσεται ἐν αὐτῇ.
28 ῎Ιδε τοῦτο εὗρον, εἶπεν ὁ ἐκκλησιαστής· μία τῇ μιᾷ τοῦ εὑρεῖν
λογισμόν, ὃν ἔτι ἐζήτησεν ἡ ψυχή μου, καὶ οὐχ εὗρον·
29 καὶ ἄνθρωπον ἕνα ἀπὸ χιλίων εὗρον, καὶ γυναῖκα ἐν πᾶσι τούτοις
οὐχ εὗρον.
30 Πλὴν ἴδε τοῦτο εὗρον, ὃ ἐποίησεν ὁ Θεὸς σὺν τὸν ἄνθρωπον εὐθῆ·
καὶ αὐτοὶ ἐζήτησαν λογισμοὺς πολλούς.
Τίς οἶδε σοφούς, καὶ τίς οἶδε λύσιν ῥήματος;

ΚΕΦ. Η'. VIII.
1 ΣΟΦΙΑ ἀνθρώπου φωτιεῖ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀναιδὴς προσώπῳ
αὐτοῦ μισθίσεται.
2 Στόμα βασιλέως φύλαξον, καὶ περὶ λόγου ὅρκου Θεοῦ μὴ σπουδάσης·
3 ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ πορεύσῃ, μὴ στῇς ἐν λόγῳ πονηρῷ, ὅτι πᾶν
ὃ ἂν θελήσῃ ποιήσει·
4 καθὼς βασιλεὺς ἐξουσιάζων λαλεῖ, καὶ τίς ἐρεῖ αὐτῷ· τί ποιήσεις;
5 ῾Ο φυλάσσων ἐντολὴν, οὐ γνώσεται ῥῆμα πονηρόν· καὶ καιρὸν
κρίσεως γινώσκει καρδία σοφοῦ.
6 ῞Οτι παντὶ πράγματι ἐστὶ καιρὸς καὶ κρίσις· ἔτι γνῶσις τοῦ
ἀνθρώπου πολλὴ ἐπ᾿ αὐτόν.
7 ῞Οτι οὐκ ἔστι γινώσκων τί τὸ ἐσόμενον· ὅτι καθὼς ἔσται, τίς
ἀναγγελεῖ αὐτῷ;
8 Οὐκ ἔστιν ἄνθρωπος ἐξουσιάζων ἐν πνεύματι, τοῦ κωλῦσαι σὺν τὸ
πνεῦμα· καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἐξουσιάζων ἐν ἡμέρᾳ θανάτου, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν
ἀποστολὴ ἐν ἡμέρᾳ πολέμου· καὶ οὐ διασώσει ἀσέβεια τὸν παρ᾿
αὐτῆς.
9 Καὶ σὺν πᾶν τοῦτο ἴδον, καὶ ἔδωκα τὴν καρδίαν μου εἰς πᾶν

**CHAPTER 7**

**20** ...ruling over those that are in the city.
    For there is no man righteous upon the earth, who shall do good and not sin.
**21** And indeed, unto all the words which they shall speak,
    not of thy heart; lest thou hear thy servant cursing thee.
**22** Moreover, oftentimes shall it cause thee to be wicked,
    and many sittings shall corrupt thy heart,
    for even as thou thyself also hast cursed others.
**23** All these things have I proved in wisdom:
    I said, "I will be wise";
**24** But this wisdom was far removed from me, farther than it was;
    and [it is] a deep depth, who shall find it?
**25** I turned myself about, and my heart, to know and to examine
    and to seek out wisdom and reason,
    and to know the folly of the wicked, and [their] harshness and madness.
**26** And I found her more bitter than death,
    even the woman whose heart is snares and nets, and whose hands are bonds;
**27** He that is good before the face of God shall be delivered from her;
    but the sinner shall be caught by her.
**28** Behold, this I have found, said the Preacher,
    one by one, to discover a conclusion,
    which my soul yet sought, but I found not.
**29** And one man among a thousand I found;
    but a woman among all these I found not.
**30** Nevertheless, behold, this have I found:
    that God made man upright; but they have sought out many schemes.

Who knoweth the wise, and who knoweth the solution of a matter?

**CHAPTER 8**

**1** The wisdom of a man shall enlighten his countenance,
    and the impudent shall be hired by his countenance.
**2** Observe the mouth of the king; and concerning the word of the oath of God, be not zealous.
**3** Go forth from his presence; stand not in an evil matter;
    for whatsoever he wills, that shall he do.
**4** For as a king that speaketh with authority,
    who shall say unto him, "What doest thou?"
**5** He that keeps the commandment shall know no evil thing;
    and the heart of the wise knows a time of judgment.
**6** For to every matter there is a time and a judgment;
    yet great is the knowledge of man concerning it.
**7** For there is none that knoweth what shall be;
    for as it shall be, who shall declare it unto him?
**8** There is no man having authority over the spirit, to restrain the spirit;
    and there is none having authority in the day of death;
    and there is no sending forth in the day of war;
    and wickedness shall not save him that is by her.
**9** And all this have I seen, and I gave my heart unto every [work],
