4. αὐτὸ, αἱ ἡμέραι τῶν βασιλέων ἡμῶν· ἤρξαντο οἱ ἄρχοντες θυμοῦ-
5. σθαι ἐξ οἴνου, ἐξέτεινε τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ μετὰ λοιμῶν· διότι ἀνεκαύ-
6. θησαν ὡς κλίβανος αἱ καρδίαι αὐτῶν, ἐν τῷ καταράσσειν αὐτούς·
    ὅλην τὴν νύκτα ὕπνου Ἐφραὶμ ἐνεπλήσθη· πρωΐ ἐγενήθη, ἀνέ-
    καύθη ὡς πῦρ φέγγος.
7. Πάντες ἐθερμάνθησαν, ὡς κλίβανος πυρὸς καιομένου αἱ καρδίαι αὐ-
    τῶν, καὶ κατέφαγε πῦρ τοὺς κριτὰς αὐ-
    τῶν· πάντες οἱ βασιλεῖς αὐτῶν ἔπεσον, οὐκ ἦν ὁ ἐπικαλούμενος
    ἐν αὐτοῖς πρὸς ἐμέ.
8. Ἐφραὶμ ἐν τοῖς λαοῖς αὐτοῦ συνανεμίγνυτο,
    Ἐφραὶμ ἐγένετο ἐγκρυφίας, οὐ μεταστρεφόμενος·
9. κατέφαγον ἀλ-
    λότριοι τὴν ἰσχὺν αὐτοῦ, αὐτὸς δὲ οὐκ ἐπέγνω· καὶ πολλαὶ ἐξην-
    θήσαν αὐτῶν, καὶ αὐτὸς οὐκ ἔγνω.
10. Καὶ ταπεινωθήσεται ἡ ὕβρις
    Ἰσραὴλ εἰς πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἐπέστρεψαν πρὸς Κύριον τὸν
    Θεὸν αὐτῶν, καὶ οὐκ ἐξεζήτησαν αὐτὸν ἐν πᾶσι τούτοις.
11. Καὶ
    ἦν Ἐφραὶμ ὡς περιστερὰ ἄνους, οὐκ ἔχουσα καρδίαν· Αἴγυπτον
    ἐπεκαλεῖτο, καὶ εἰς Ἀσσυρίους ἐπορεύθησαν.
12. Καθὼς ἂν πορεύων-
    ται, ἐπιβαλῶ ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς τὸ δίκτυόν μου, καθὼς τὰ πετεινὰ τοῦ
    οὐρανοῦ καταξῶ αὐτούς· παιδεύσω αὐτοὺς ἐν τῇ ἀκοῇ τῆς θλίψεως
    αὐτῶν.
13. Οὐαὶ αὐτοῖς, ὅτι ἀπεπήδησαν ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ· δῆλοί εἰσιν,
    ὅτι ἠσέβησαν εἰς ἐμέ· ἐγὼ δὲ ἐλυτρωσάμην αὐτοὺς, αὐτοὶ δὲ κατ-
    ελάλησαν κατ᾿ ἐμοῦ ψευδῆ.
14. Καὶ οὐκ ἐβόησαν πρὸς με αἱ καρδίαι
    αὐτῶν, ἀλλ᾿ ἡ ὠλόλυζον ἐν ταῖς κοίταις αὐτῶν· ἐπὶ σίτῳ καὶ οἴ-
    νῳ κατετέμνοντο.
15. Ἐπαιδεύθησαν ἐν ἐμοί, καὶ ἐγὼ κατίσχυσα τοὺς
    βραχίονας αὐτῶν, καὶ εἰς ἐμὲ ἐλογίσαντο πονηρά.
16. Ἀπεστράφη-
    σαν εἰς οὐδὲν, ἐγένοντο ὡς τόξον ἐντεταμένον· πεσοῦνται ἐν ῥομ-
    φαίᾳ οἱ ἄρχοντες αὐτῶν διὰ ἀπαιδευσίαν γλώσσης αὐτῶν. οὗτος
    ὁ φαυλισμὸς αὐτῶν ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ.

**ΚΕΦ. Η'. VIII.**

1. Εἰς κόλπον αὐτῶν, ὡς γῆ, ὡς ἀετὸς ἐπ᾿ οἶκον Κυρίου, ἀνθ᾿
    ὧν παρέβησαν τὴν διαθήκην μου, καὶ κατὰ τοῦ νόμου μου ἠσέβη-
    σαν.
2. Ἐμὲ κεκράξονται· ὁ Θεὸς, ἐγνώκαμέν σε.
3. Ὅτι Ἰσραὴλ
    ἀπεστρέψατο ἀγαθὰ, ἐχθρὸν κατεδίωξαν·
4. ἑαυτοῖς ἐβασίλευσαν, καὶ
    οὐ δι᾿ ἐμοῦ ἦρξαν· καὶ οὐκ ἐγνώρισάν μοι τὸ ἀργύριον αὐτῶν, καὶ
    τὸ χρυσίον αὐτῶν ἐποίησαν ἑαυτοῖς εἴδωλα, ὅπως ἐξολεθρευθῶ-
    σιν.
5. Ἀπότριψαι τὸν μόσχον σου Σαμάρεια, παρωξύνθη ὁ θυμός

**HOSEA**
**CHAPTER 7**

**4** ...until it be leavened.
    In the days of our kings, the rulers began to be enraged by wine;
**5** He stretched forth his hand with plagues.
**6** For their hearts were kindled as an oven,
    When they cursed them.
    All the night was Ephraim filled with sleep;
    In the morning it was made, and kindled as a light of fire.
**7** All of them were made hot, their hearts as an oven of burning fire;
    And fire consumed their judges.
    All their kings have fallen,
    And there was none among them that called upon Me.
**8** Ephraim hath mingled himself among his peoples;
    Ephraim is become a cake not turned.
**9** Strangers have devoured his strength, yet he knew it not;
    And many [signs of decay] have blossomed upon him, yet he knew it not.
**10** And the pride of Israel shall be humbled before his face;
    Yet they have not returned unto the Lord their God,
    Nor have they sought Him for all these things.
**11** And Ephraim was as a senseless dove, having no heart;
    He called upon Egypt, and to the Assyrians did they go.
**12** As they shall go, I will cast My net upon them;
    I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven.
    I will chastise them by the report of their affliction.
**13** Woe unto them, for they have fled from Me!
    They are manifest, for they have sinned against Me.
    Yet I redeemed them, but they have spoken lies against Me.
**14** And their hearts cried not unto Me,
    But they howled upon their beds.
    For corn and for wine they cut themselves.
**15** Though I chastened them,
    And I strengthened their arms,
    Yet against Me did they imagine evil.
**16** They have turned themselves unto nothing;
    They are become as a taut bow.
    Their princes shall fall by the sword
    For the unchastenedness of their tongue;
    This shall be their scorn in the land of Egypt.

**CHAPTER 8**

**1** Into their bosom, as the earth,
    [So shall come] an eagle upon the house of the Lord;
    Because they have transgressed My covenant,
    And against My law have they sinned.
**2** Unto Me shall they cry, saying,
**3** "O God, we have known Thee!"
    For Israel hath cast away good;
    They have pursued an enemy.
**4** They have made kings for themselves, and not by Me have they ruled;
    And they have not made known to Me their silver and their gold,
    But have made for themselves idols, that they might be utterly destroyed.
**5** Cast off thy calf, O Samaria!
    My wrath hath been provoked...
