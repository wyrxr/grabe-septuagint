ΚΕΦ. ΛΔ´. ΛΔ´. ΙΕΡΕΜΙΑΣ. 1269
σαυρεῖς αὐτῆς, ἡ λέγουσα, τίς εἰσελεύσεται ἐπ᾿ ἐμέ;
5 Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ φέρω φόβον ἐπὶ σέ, εἶπε Κύριος τῶν δυνάμεων, ἀπὸ πάσης τῆς
περιοίκου σου, καὶ διασπαρήσεσθε ἕκαστος εἰς πρόσωπον αὑτοῦ,
6 καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ὁ συνάγων μετανάστην. Καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα ἐπιστρέψω τὴν
αἰχμαλωσίαν Μωὰβ ἐπ᾿ ἐσχάτων τῶν ἡμερῶν.

ΤΗ ΚΗΔΑΡ ΤΗ ΒΑΣΙΛΙΣΣΗ ΤΗΣ ΑΥΛΗΣ, ΗΝ ΕΠΑΤΑΞΕ
ΝΑΒΟΥΧΟΔΟΝΟΣΟΡ Ο ΒΑΣΙΛΕΥΣ ΒΑΒΥΛΩΝΟΣ, οὕτως
εἶπε Κύριος·
28 ᾿Ανάστητε, καὶ ἀνάβητε ἐπὶ Κηδὰρ, καὶ πλήσατε τοὺς υἱοὺς Κεδέμ.
29 Σκηνὰς αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰ πρόβατα αὐτῶν λήψονται· ἱμάτια αὐτῶν, καὶ πάντα
τὰ σκεύη αὐτῶν, καὶ καμήλους αὐτῶν λήψονται ἑαυτοῖς· καὶ καλέσατε
ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς ἀπορίαν κυκλόθεν.
30 Φεύγετε λίαν, ἀναστάθητε, ἐβαθύνατε εἰς κάθισιν, καθήμενοι ἐν τῇ
αὐλῇ, φησὶ Κύριος, ὅτι ἐβουλεύσατο ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς Ναβουχοδονόσορ βασιλεὺς
Βαβυλῶνος βουλὴν, καὶ ἐλογίσατο ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς λογισμόν.
31 ᾿Ανάστηθι, καὶ ἀνάβηθι ἐπὶ ἔθνος εὐσταθοῦν, καθήμενον εἰς ἀναψυχὴν,
φησὶ Κύριος, οἷς οὐκ εἰσὶ θύραι, οὐδὲ βάλανοι, οὐ μοχλοὶ, μόνοι καταλύουσι.
32 Καὶ ἔσονται οἱ κάμηλοι αὐτῶν εἰς προνομὴν, καὶ πλῆθος κτηνῶν αὐτῶν
εἰς ἀπώλειαν, καὶ λιχνήσω αὐτοὺς παντὶ πνεύματι κεχαριωμένους πρὸ
προσώπου αὐτῶν, ἐκ παντὸς πέραν αὐτῶν οἴσω τὴν τροπὴν αὐτῶν, εἶπε Κύριος.
33 Καὶ ἔσται ἡ αὐλὴ διατριβὴ στρουθῶν, καὶ ἀβατος ἕως αἰῶνος, οὐ μὴ
καθίσῃ ἐκεῖ ἄνθρωπος, καὶ οὐ μὴ κατοικήσῃ ἐκεῖ υἱὸς ἀνθρώπου.

ΤΗ ΔΑΜΑΣΚΩ,
23 Κατησχύνθη ῾Ημὰθ, καὶ ᾿Αρφάθ, ὅτι ἤκουσαν ἀκοὴν πονηρὰν, ἐξέστησαν
ἐν θαλάσσῃ, ἐθυμώθησαν, ἀναπαύσασθαι οὐ μὴ δύνανται.
24 ᾿Εξελύθη Δαμασκὸς, ἀπεστράφη εἰς φυγὴν, τρόμος ἐπελάβετο αὐτῆς, καὶ
ὠδῖνες κατέσχον αὐτὴν ὡς τικτούσης.
25 Πῶς οὐχὶ ἐγκατέλιπε πόλιν ἐμὴν, κώμην ἠγαπημένην; Διὰ τοῦτο
πεσοῦνται νεανίσκοι ἐν πλατείαις σου, καὶ πάν-
26 τες οἱ ἄνδρες οἱ πολεμισταί σου πεσοῦνται, φησὶ Κύριος.
27 Καὶ καύσω πῦρ ἐν τείχει Δαμασκοῦ, καὶ καταφάγεται ἀμφότερα υἱοῦ Ἄδερ.

ΚΕΦ. ΛΔ´. XXXI.
(Hebr. XLVIII.)
ΤΗ ΜΩΑΒ οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος τῶν δυνάμεων ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ·
1 Οὐαὶ ἐπὶ Ναβαῦ, ὅτι ὤλετο, ἔαλω, ἐλήφθη Καριάθαιμ,

**Jeremiah, Chapter 30**
(Continuation of Hebrew Chapter 49)

...[in] her treasures, who saith, 'Who shall come in against me?'
**5** Behold, I bring a terror upon thee, saith the Lord of hosts, from every one that is round about thee; and ye shall be scattered, every man to his own face,
**6** and there shall be none to gather the fugitive. And after these things, I will turn back the captivity of Moab in the latter days.

**Concerning Kedar, to the Queen of the Court, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon smote.**
Thus saith the Lord:
**28** Arise ye, and go up against Kedar, and fill [with plunder] the children of Kedem.
**29** Their tents and their sheep shall they take; their garments, and all their vessels, and their camels shall they take for themselves; and ye shall summon terror against them round about.
**30** Flee ye mightily, rise up, settle deep down, ye that dwell in the court, saith the Lord, for Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath purposed a plan against you.
**31** Arise, and go up against a nation that is at ease, that dwelleth securely, saith the Lord, who have neither gates nor bars nor bolts, [but] dwell alone.
**32** And their camels shall be for a spoil, and the multitude of their cattle for a prey; and I will make them greedy unto every wind, [even] them that are favoured before their face; and from every side, I will bring their overthrow, saith the Lord.
**33** And their dwelling shall be a haunt for ostriches, and desolate forever; no man shall abide there, neither shall the son of man dwell therein.

**Concerning Damascus:**
**23** Hamath is confounded, and Arphad; for they have heard an evil report. They were dismayed in the sea, they were troubled; they cannot rest.
**24** Damascus is become feeble, she is turned to flight, and trembling hath seized her, and pangs have taken hold of her as of a woman in travail.
**25** How hath he not forsaken my city, the beloved village? Therefore shall her young men fall in her streets, and all
**26** her men of war shall fall, saith the Lord.
**27** And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the twin palaces of the son of Ader.

**Jeremiah, Chapter 34 (also numbered XXXI; corresponding to Hebrew Chapter 48)**

**Concerning Moab.**
Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel:
**1** Woe unto Nebo! For it is destroyed and taken; Kiriathaim is taken,
