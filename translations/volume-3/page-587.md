ΚΕΦ. ΙΑ΄. ΙΒ΄. ΖΑΧΑΡΙΑΣ. 1525
ποιμαίνοντες τὰ μάταια, καὶ οἱ καταλειπότες τὰ πρόβατα· μάχαιρα ἐπὶ τοὺς βραχίονας αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν ὀφθαλμόν τὸν δεξιὸν αὐτοῦ· ὁ βραχίων αὐτοῦ Ξηρανθήσεται, Ξηρανθήσεται, καὶ ὁ ὀφθαλμὸς αὐτοῦ ὁ δεξιὸς ἐκτυφλωμένος ἐκτυφλωθήσεται.

**ΚΕΦ. ΙΒ΄. ΧΙΙ.**

1 ΛΗΜΜΑ λόγου Κυρίου ἐπὶ τὸν Ἰσραήλ, λέγει Κύριος, ἐκτείνον οὐρανόν, καὶ θεμελιῶν γῆν, καὶ πλάσσων πνεῦμα ἀνθρώπου ἐν αὐτῷ·
2 ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ τίθημι τὴν Ἱερουσαλὴμ ὡς πρόθυρα σαλευόμενα πᾶσι τοῖς λαοῖς κύκλῳ, καὶ ἐν τῇ Ἰουδαίᾳ (καὶ) ἔσται περιοχὴ ἐπὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ·
3 καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ θήσομαι τὴν Ἱερουσαλὴμ λίθον καταπατούμενον πᾶσι τοῖς ἔθνεσι· πᾶς ὁ καταπατῶν αὐτὴν ἐμπαίζων ἐμπαίζεται, καὶ ἐπισυναχθήσονται ἐπ᾿ αὐτὴν πάντα τὰ ἔθνη τῆς γῆς.
4 Ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ, πατάξω πάντα ἵππον ἐν ἐκστάσει, καὶ τὸν ἀναβάτην αὐτοῦ ἐν παραφρονήσει· ἐπὶ δὲ τὸν οἶκον Ἰούδα διανοίξω τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς μου, καὶ πάντας τοὺς ἵππους τῶν λαῶν πατάξω ἐν ἀποτυφλώσει.
5 Καὶ ἐροῦσιν οἱ χιλίαρχοι Ἰούδα ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις αὐτῶν· εὑρήσομεν ἑαυτοῖς τοὺς κατοικοῦντας Ἱερουσαλήμ ἐν Κυρίῳ παντοκράτορι Θεῷ αὐτῶν.
6 Ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ θήσομαι τοὺς χιλιάρχους Ἰούδα ὡς δαλὸν πυρὸς ἐν ξύλοις, καὶ ὡς λαμπάδα πυρὸς ἐν καλάμῃ, καὶ καταφάγονται ἐκ δεξιῶν, καὶ ἐξ εὐωνύμων πάντας τοὺς λαοὺς κυκλόθεν· καὶ κατοικήσει Ἱερουσαλήμ ἔτι καθ᾿ ἑαυτὴν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ.
7 Καὶ σώσει Κύριος τὰ σκηνώματα Ἰούδα, καθὼς ἀπ᾿ ἀρχῆς, ὅπως μὴ μεγαλύνηται καύχημα οἴκου Δαυίδ, καὶ ἔπαρσις τῶν κατοικούντων Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐπὶ τὸν Ἰούδαν.
8 Καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ὑπερασπιεῖ Κύριος ὑπὲρ τῶν κατοικούντων Ἱερουσαλήμ· καὶ ἔσται ὁ ἀσθενῶν ἐν αὐτοῖς ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ὡς Δαυίδ, ὁ δὲ οἶκος Δαυίδ ὡς οἶκος Θεοῦ, ὡς ἄγγελος Κυρίου ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν.
9 Καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ζητήσω τοῦ ἐξᾶραι πάντα τὰ ἔθνη τὰ ἐπερχόμενα ἐπὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ.
10 Καὶ ἐκχεῶ ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον Δαυίδ, καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς κατοικούντας Ἱερουσαλήμ πνεῦμα χάριτος καὶ οἰκτιρμοῦ, καὶ ἐπιβλέψονται πρὸς μέ, ἀνθ᾿ ὧν κατωρχήσαντο· καὶ κόψονται ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν κοπετόν, ὡς ἐπ᾿ ἀγαπητόν, καὶ ὀδυνηθήσονται ὀδύνην ὡς ἐπὶ

**Zechariah [Chapter] 11**

**17** The shepherds feeding upon vanity, and those who have forsaken the sheep: a sword shall be upon his arms, and upon his right eye! His arm shall be withered, yea, withered; and his right eye, though blinded, shall be utterly blinded.

**Zechariah [Chapter] 12**

**1** The burden of the word of the Lord concerning Israel, saith the Lord, who stretcheth forth the heavens and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him.
**2** Behold, I will make Jerusalem as a threshold that shaketh to all the peoples round about; and in Judea, [yea, and] there shall be a siege against Jerusalem.
**3** And it shall come to pass in that day, I will make Jerusalem a stone to be trodden upon by all the nations; every one that trampleth upon her shall be surely mocked, and all the nations of the earth shall be gathered together against her.
**4** In that day, saith the Lord Almighty, I shall smite every horse with astonishment, and his rider with madness. But upon the house of Judah will I open Mine eyes, and all the horses of the nations will I smite with blindness.
**5** And the captains of Judah shall say in their hearts, "We shall find the dwellers of Jerusalem [to be sustained] in the Lord Almighty, their God."
**6** In that day will I make the captains of Judah as a firebrand among wood, and as a torch of fire among straw; and they shall devour, on the right hand and on the left, all the peoples round about. And Jerusalem shall yet dwell in her own place, even in Jerusalem.
**7** And the Lord shall save the dwellings of Judah, as from the beginning; that the glory of the house of David may not be magnified, nor the exaltation of the inhabitants of Jerusalem over Judah.
**8** And it shall come to pass in that day, the Lord shall protect the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and the weak among them in that day shall be as David, and the house of David shall be as the house of God, as the Angel of the Lord before them.
**9** And it shall come to pass in that day, I will seek to cut off all the nations that come against Jerusalem.
**10** And I will pour out upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and of compassion. And they shall look upon Me, [even] Him, for whom they danced [in derision]; and they shall mourn for Him with a lamentation, as one mourneth for an only son; and they shall be in anguish, [even] a grief, as one [grieves] for...
