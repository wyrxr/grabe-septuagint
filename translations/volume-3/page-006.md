ΨΑΛΤΗΡΙΟΝ. ΨΑΛΜ. Θ΄.
13 τοῖς ἔθνεσι τὰ ἐπιτηδεύματα αὐτοῦ· ὅτι ἐκζητῶν τὰ αἵματα αὐ-
14 τῶν ἐμνήσθη, οὐκ ἐπελάθετο τῆς κραυγῆς τῶν πενήτων. Ἐλέη-
σόν με Κύριε, ἴδε τὴν ταπείνωσίν μου ἐκ τῶν ἐχθρῶν μου, ὁ ὑψῶν
15 με ἐκ τῶν πυλῶν τοῦ θανάτου· ὅπως ἂν ἐξαγγείλω πάσας τὰς αἰ-
νέσεις σου ἐν ταῖς πύλαις τῆς θυγατρὸς Σιών· ἀγαλλιάσομαι ἐν
16 τῷ σωτηρίῳ σου. Ἐνεπάγησαν ἔθνη ἐν διαφθορᾷ ᾗ ἐποίησαν· ἐν
17 παγίδι ταύτῃ ᾗ ἔκρυψαν, συνελήφθη ὁ ποῦς αὐτῶν. Γινώσκεται
Κύριος κρίματα ποιῶν· ἐν τοῖς ἔργοις τῶν χειρῶν αὐτοῦ συνελή-
18 φθη ὁ ἁμαρτωλός. Ὠδὴ διαψάλματος. Ἀποστραφήτωσαν οἱ ἁμαρ-
τωλοὶ εἰς τὸν ἅδην, πάντα τὰ ἔθνη τὰ ἐπιλανθανόμενα τοῦ Θεοῦ.
19 Ὅτι οὐκ εἰς τέλος ἐπιλησθήσεται ὁ πτωχός, ἡ ὑπομονὴ τῶν
20 πενήτων οὐκ ἀπολεῖται εἰς τέλος. Ἀνάστηθι Κύριε, μὴ κραταιού-
21 σθω ἄνθρωπος· κριθήτωσαν ἔθνη ἐνώπιόν σου. Κατάστησον Κύ-
ριε νομοθέτην ἐπ᾿ αὐτούς· γνώτωσαν ἔθνη ὅτι ἄνθρωποι εἰσιν. Διά-
22 ψαλμα. Ἵνατί Κύριε ἀφέστηκας μακρόθεν, ὑπερορᾷς ἐν εὐκαιρίαις
23 ἐν θλίψει; Ἐν τῷ ὑπερηφανεύεσθαι τὸν ἀσεβῆ, ἐμπυρίζεται ὁ
24 πτωχός. Συλλαμβάνονται ἐν διαβουλίοις οἷς διαλογίζονται. Ὅτι
ἐπαινεῖται ὁ ἁμαρτωλὸς ἐν ταῖς ἐπιθυμίαις τῆς ψυχῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ
25 ὁ ἀδικῶν ἐνευλογεῖται. Παρώξυνε τὸν Κύριον ὁ ἁμαρτωλός· κατὰ
τὸ πλῆθος τῆς ὀργῆς αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἐκζητήσει· οὐκ ἔστιν ὁ Θεὸς ἐνώ-
26 πιον αὐτοῦ. Βεβηλοῦνται αἱ ὁδοὶ αὐτοῦ ἐν παντὶ καιρῷ· ἀνταναι-
ρεῖται τὰ κρίματά σου ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ· πάντων τῶν ἐχθρῶν
27 αὐτοῦ κατακυριεύσει. Εἶπε γὰρ ἐν καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ· οὐ μὴ σαλευθῶ,
28 ἀπὸ γενεᾶς εἰς γενεὰν ἄνευ κακοῦ· οὗ ἀρᾶς τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ γέ-
μει καὶ πικρίας καὶ δόλου, ὑπὸ τὴν γλῶσσαν αὐτοῦ κόπος καὶ πό-
29 νος. Ἐγκαθῆται ἐν ἐνέδρᾳ μετὰ πλουσίων, ἐν ἀποκρύφοις ἀπο-
κτεῖναι ἀθῶον· οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸν πένητα ἀποβλέπουσιν.
30 Ἐνεδρεύει ἐν ἀποκρύφῳ, ὡς λέων ἐν τῇ μάνδρᾳ αὐτοῦ, ἐνεδρεύει
τοῦ ἁρπάσαι πτωχόν· ἁρπάσει πτωχὸν ἐν τῷ ἑλκῦσαι αὐτὸν ἐν
31 τῇ παγίδι αὐτοῦ. Ταπεινώσει αὐτόν· κύψει καὶ πεσεῖται ἐν τῷ
32 αὐτὸν κατακυριεῦσαι τῶν πενήτων. Εἶπε γὰρ ἐν καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ· ἐπι-
λέλησται ὁ Θεός, ἀπέστρεψε τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ τοῦ μὴ βλέπειν
33 εἰς τέλος. Ἀνάστηθι Κύριε ὁ Θεός (μου), ὑψωθήτω ἡ χείρ σου·
34 μὴ ἐπιλάθῃς τῶν πενήτων. Ἕνεκεν τίνος παρώξυνεν ὁ ἀσεβὴς τὸν
35 Θεόν; Εἶπε γὰρ ἐν καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ· οὐκ ἐκζητήσει. Βλέπεις, ὅτι
σὺ κόπον καὶ θυμὸν κατανοεῖς, τοῦ παραδοῦναι αὐτοὺς εἰς χεῖράς

**PSALM IX.**
13.   His deeds among the nations.
    For He, when seeking out their blood,
    Hath remembered;
14.   He hath not forgotten the cry of the poor.
    Have mercy upon me, O Lord;
    Behold my humility from my enemies,
    O Thou who dost raise me up from the gates of death;
15.   That I may declare all Thy praises
    In the gates of the daughter of Sion;
    I will rejoice in Thy salvation.
16.   The nations are snared in the destruction which they made;
    In this net which they hid, their foot is caught.
17.   The Lord is known when He executeth judgments;
    In the works of his own hands the sinner is caught.
    *A Song of Interlude.*
18.   Let the sinners be turned back into Hades,
    Even all the nations that forget God.
19.   For the poor shall not utterly be forgotten,
    The patience of the needy shall not perish forever.
20.   Arise, O Lord; let not man prevail;
    Let the nations be judged before Thee.
21.   Appoint, O Lord, a lawgiver over them;
    Let the nations know that they are but men.
    *Selah.*
22.   Why, O Lord, hast Thou stood afar off?
    Dost Thou overlook [us] in seasons of tribulation?
23.   When the ungodly doth boast himself,
    The poor man is set on fire.
24.   They are caught in the devices which they imagine.
    For the sinner is praised in the desires of his soul,
    And the unrighteous man is blessed.
25.   The sinner hath provoked the Lord;
    According to the multitude of his wrath he will not inquire;
    God is not before him.
26.   His ways are defiled at all times;
    Thy judgments are taken away from before his face;
    He shall lord it over all his enemies.
27.   For he hath said in his heart:
    "I shall not be moved, from generation to generation, without evil."
28.   Whose mouth is full of curses, and bitterness, and deceit;
    Under his tongue is toil and trouble.
29.   He sitteth in ambush with the rich,
    In secret places to slay the innocent;
    His eyes look keenly at the poor.
30.   He lieth in wait in a secret place,
    As a lion in his lair;
    He lieth in wait to seize the poor man;
    He will seize the poor man when he draws him into his net.
31.   He will humble him;
    He will stoop and fall when he doth dominate the poor.
32.   For he hath said in his heart:
    "God hath forgotten;
    He hath turned away His face, so as not to see unto the end."
33.   Arise, O Lord [my] God!
    Let Thy hand be lifted up;
34.   Forget not the poor.
    Wherefore hath the ungodly provoked God?
35.   For he hath said in his heart: "He will not inquire."
    Thou seest, for Thou dost perceive travail and wrath,
    To deliver them into Thy hands.
