συναγωγὴ παρατάξεως. Καὶ ἔσονται αἱ ἐκλεκταὶ φάραγγές σου, 7
πλησθήσονται ἁρμάτων, οἱ δὲ ἱππεῖς ἐμφράξουσι τὰς πύλας
σου, καὶ ἀνακαλύψουσι τὰς πύλας Ἰούδα· καὶ ἐμβλέψονται τῇ 8
ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ εἰς τοὺς ἐκλεκτοὺς οἴκους τῆς πόλεως, καὶ ἀνα-
καλύψουσι τὰ κρυπτὰ τῶν οἴκων τῆς ἄκρας Δαυίδ· καὶ εἴδοσαν, 9
ὅτι πλείους εἰσί, καὶ (ὅτι) ἀπέστρεψαν τὸ ὕδωρ τῆς ἀρχαίας
κολυμβήθρας εἰς τὴν πόλιν, καὶ τοὺς οἴκους Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἠριθ-
μήσατε, καὶ (ὅτι) καθεῖλοσαν τοὺς οἴκους Ἱερουσαλὴμ εἰς ὀχύ-
ρωμα τοῦ τείχους τῇ πόλει. Καὶ ἐποιήσατε ἑαυτοῖς ὕδωρ ἀνα- 11
μέσον τῶν δύο τειχῶν, ἐσώτερον τῆς κολυμβήθρας τῆς ἀρχαί-
ας, καὶ οὐκ ἐνεβλέψατε εἰς τὸν ἀπ᾿ ἀρχῆς ποιήσαντα αὐτήν,
καὶ τὸν κτήσαντα αὐτὴν πόρρωθεν οὐκ εἴδατε. Καὶ ἐκάλεσε 12
Κύριος Κύριος Σαβαὼθ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ κλαυθμὸν καὶ κο-
πετόν, καὶ ξύρησιν καὶ ζῶσιν σάκκων, αὐτοὶ δὲ ἐποιήσαντο 13
εὐφροσύνην καὶ ἀγαλλίαμα σφάζοντες μόσχους, καὶ θύοντες πρό-
βατα, ὥστε φαγεῖν κρέα, καὶ πιεῖν οἶνον, λέγοντες· φάγωμεν
καὶ πίωμεν, αὔριον γὰρ ἀποθνήσκομεν. Καὶ ἀνακεκαλυμμένα 14
ταῦτα ἐστιν ἐν τοῖς ὠσὶ Κυρίου Σαβαώθ, ὅτι οὐκ ἀφεθήσεται
ὑμῖν αὕτη ἡ ἁμαρτία, ἕως ἂν ἀποθάνητε, εἶπε Κύριος Κύ- 15
ριος τῶν δυνάμεων, τάδε λέγει Κύριος Σαβαώθ· πορεύου εἰσέλ-
θε εἰς τὸ παστοφόριον, πρὸς Σομνᾶν τὸν ταμίαν, καὶ εἰπὸν αὐτῷ. 16
Τί σὺ ὧδε, καὶ τί σοί ἐστιν ὧδε; ὅτι ἐλατόμησας σεαυτῷ ὧδε
μνημεῖον, καὶ ἐποίησας σεαυτῷ ἐν ὑψηλῷ μνημείῳ, καὶ ἔγρα- 17
ψας σεαυτῷ ἐν πέτρᾳ σκηνήν; Ἰδοὺ δὴ Κύριος Σαβαὼθ ἐκ-
βαλεῖ καὶ ἐκτρίψει ἄνδρα, καὶ ἀφελεῖ τὴν στολήν σου καὶ
τὸν στέφανόν σου τὸν ἔνδοξον, καὶ ῥίψει σε εἰς χώραν μεγάλην 18
καὶ ἀμέτρητον, καὶ ἐκεῖ ἀποθανῇ· καὶ θήσει τὸ ἅρμα σου τὸ καλὸν
εἰς ἀτιμίαν, καὶ τὸν οἶκον τοῦ ἄρχοντός σου εἰς καταπάτημα, καὶ 19
ἀφαιρεθήσῃ ἐκ τῆς οἰκονομίας σου καὶ ἐκ τῆς στάσεώς σου.
Καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ καὶ καλέσω τὸν παῖδά μου Ἐλια- 20
κείμ τὸν τοῦ Χελκίου, καὶ ἐνδύσω αὐτὸν τὴν στολήν σου, 21
καὶ τὸν στέφανόν σου δώσω αὐτῷ καὶ τὸ κράτος, καὶ τὴν οἰ-
κονομίαν σου δώσω εἰς τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἔσαι ὡς πατὴρ
τοῖς ἐνοικοῦσιν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ τοῖς ἐνοικοῦσιν ἐν Ἰούδα. Καὶ 22
δώσω τὴν δόξαν Δαυὶδ αὐτῷ, καὶ ἄρξει, καὶ οὐκ ἔσαι ὁ ἀντιλέγων·
καὶ δώσω τὴν κλεῖδα οἴκου Δαυὶδ ἐπὶ τοῦ ὤμου αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἀνοίξει.

**Chapter 22**
**7** and a gathering for battle. And thy choicest valleys shall be full of chariots, and the horsemen shall besiege thy gates;
**8** and they shall lay bare the gates of Judah. And ye shall look in that day upon the choicest houses of the city, and ye shall lay bare the hidden [treasures] of the houses of the stronghold of David.
**9** And they saw that they were many, and [that] they turned back the water of the old pool into the city. And ye numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and [that] ye pulled down the houses of Jerusalem to fortify the wall for the city.
**11** And ye made a reservoir for water between the two walls, within the old pool; but ye looked not unto Him that made it from the beginning, neither saw ye Him that established it long ago.
**12** And in that day did the Lord, the Lord Sabaoth, call for weeping, and for lamentation, and for shaving [of heads], and for girding with sackcloth.
**13** But behold, they made joy and gladness, slaying calves, and sacrificing sheep, eating flesh, and drinking wine; saying, "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die."
**14** And these things are revealed in the ears of the Lord Sabaoth: that this iniquity shall not be purged from you, till ye die, saith the Lord, the Lord of hosts.
**15** Thus saith the Lord Sabaoth: Go, enter thou into the chamber, unto Shebna the steward, and say unto him,
**16** "What hast thou here, and what is thine here, that thou hast hewn out for thyself a tomb here, and made for thyself a lofty monument, and carved for thyself a dwelling in the rock?
**17** Behold, the Lord Sabaoth shall cast forth and utterly destroy [this] man, and shall take away thy robe and thy glorious crown.
**18** And shall cast thee into a large and boundless land, and there shalt thou die; and shall bring thy beautiful chariot into dishonour,
**19** and the house of thy prince unto a trampling. And thou shalt be removed from thy stewardship, and from thy station."
**20** And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah,
**21** and I will clothe him with thy robe, and thy crown will I give unto him and the authority; and thy stewardship will I commit into his hands; and he shall be as a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the inhabitants of Judah.
**22** And I will give him the glory of David; and he shall rule, and none shall gainsay [him]. And I will lay the key of the house of David upon his shoulder; and he shall open.
