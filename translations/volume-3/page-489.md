σύγκρισιν αὐτοῦ; Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Δανιὴλ ἐνώπιον τοῦ βασιλέως, 27
καὶ εἶπε· τὸ μυστήριον ὃ ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐπερωτᾷ οὐκ ἔστι σοφῶν
μάγων ἐπαοιδῶν γαζαρηνῶν ἀναγγεῖλαι τῷ βασιλεῖ. Ἀλλ᾽ ἔστιν 28
ὁ Θεὸς ἐν οὐρανῷ ἀποκαλύπτων μυστήρια, καὶ ἐγνώρισε τῷ βα-
σιλεῖ Ναβουχοδονόσορ, ἃ δεῖ γενέσθαι ἐπ᾽ ἐσχάτων τῶν ἡμερῶν·
τὸ ἐνύπνιόν σου καὶ αἱ δράσεις τῆς κεφαλῆς σου ἐπὶ τῆς κοίτης
σου, τοῦτό ἐστι. Σὺ βασιλεῦ ἐθεώρεις· οἱ διαλογισμοί σου ἐπὶ 29
τῆς κοίτης σου ἀνέβησαν, τί δεῖ γενέσθαι μετὰ ταῦτα· καὶ ὁ ἀπο-
καλύπτων μυστήρια ἐγνώρισέ σοι ἃ δεῖ γενέσθαι. Καὶ ἐμοὶ οὐκ 30
ἐν σοφίᾳ τῇ οὔσῃ ἐν ἐμοὶ παρὰ πάντας τοὺς ζῶντας τὸ μυστή-
ριον τοῦτο ἀπεκαλύφθη, ἀλλ᾽ ἕνεκεν τοῦ τὴν σύγκρισιν τῷ βασι-
λεῖ γνωρίσαι, ἵνα τοὺς διαλογισμοὺς τῆς καρδίας σου γνῷς. Σύ, 31
βασιλεῦ, ἐθεώρεις, καὶ ἰδοὺ εἰκὼν μία, μεγάλη ἡ εἰκὼν ἐκείνη,
καὶ ἡ πρόσοψις αὐτῆς ὑπερφεὴς, ἑστῶσα πρὸ προσώπου σου, καὶ
ἡ ὅρασις αὐτῆς φοβερά. Ἡ εἰκὼν, ἧς ἡ κεφαλὴ χρυσίου χρηστοῦ, 32
αἱ χεῖρες καὶ τὸ στῆθος καὶ οἱ βραχίονες αὐτῆς ἀργυροῖ, ἡ κοι-
λία καὶ οἱ μηροὶ χαλκοῖ, αἱ κνῆμαι σιδηραῖ, οἱ πόδες μέρος μὲν 33
τι σιδηροῦν, καὶ μέρος δέ τι ὀστράκινον. Ἐθεώρεις ἕως οὗ ἀπε- 34
σχίσθη λίθος ἐξ ὄρους ἄνευ χειρῶν, καὶ ἐπάταξε τὴν εἰκόνα ἐπὶ
τοὺς πόδας τοὺς σιδηροῦς καὶ ὀστρακίνους, καὶ ἐλέπτυνεν αὐ-
τοὺς εἰς τέλος. Τότε ἐλεπτύνθησαν εἰσάπαξ ὁ σίδηρος, τὸ ὄστρα- 35
κον, ὁ χαλκὸς, ὁ ἄργυρος, ὁ χρυσός· καὶ ἐγένετο ὡσεὶ κονιορτὸς
ἀπὸ ἅλωνος θερινῆς· καὶ ἐξῆρεν αὐτὰ τὸ πλῆθος τοῦ πνεύματος,
καὶ τόπος οὐχ εὑρέθη αὐτοῖς, καὶ ὁ λίθος ὁ πατάξας τὴν εἰκόνα
ἐγενήθη ὄρος μέγα, καὶ ἐπλήρωσε πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν. Τοῦτό ἐστι 36
τὸ ἐνύπνιον, καὶ τὴν σύγκρισιν αὐτοῦ ἐροῦμεν ἐνώπιον τοῦ βασιλέ-
ως. Σὺ, βασιλεῦ, βασιλεὺς βασιλέων, ᾧ ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ οὐρανοῦ βα- 37
σιλείαν ἰσχυρὰν καὶ κραταιὰν καὶ ἔντιμον ἔδωκεν ἐν παντὶ τόπῳ, 38
ὅπου κατοικοῦσιν οἱ υἱοὶ τῶν ἀνθρώπων· θηρία τε ἀγροῦ, καὶ
πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ ἰχθύας τῆς θαλάσσης ἔδωκεν ἐν τῇ χει-
ρί σου, καὶ κατέστησέ σε Κύριον πάντων· σὺ εἶ ἡ κεφαλὴ ἡ
χρυσῆ. Καὶ ὀπίσω σου ἀναστήσεται βασιλεία ἑτέρα ἥττων σου, 39
ἥτις ἐστὶν ὁ ἄργυρος, καὶ βασιλεία τρίτη, ἥτις ἐστὶν ὁ χαλκὸς,
ἣ κυριεύσει πάσης τῆς γῆς, καὶ βασιλεία τετάρτη, ἥτις ἔσται 40
ἰσχυρὰ ὡς σίδηρος· ὃν τρόπον ὁ σίδηρος λεπτύνει καὶ δαμάζει πάν-
τα, οὕτως πάντα λεπτυνεῖ καὶ δαμάσει. Καὶ ὅτι εἶδες τοὺς πό- 41

²⁷ And Daniel answered before the king, and said, "The mystery which the king inquireth of is not for wise men, nor magicians, nor enchanters, nor soothsayers, to declare unto the king.
²⁸ But there is a God in heaven that revealeth mysteries, and He hath made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what shall come to pass in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, this is it.
²⁹ Thou, O king, didst behold: thy thoughts came up upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter; and He that revealeth mysteries hath made known to thee what shall come to pass.
³⁰ And not for any wisdom that is in me more than in all the living hath this mystery been revealed unto me, but for the intent that the interpretation thereof might be made known to the king, and that thou mightest know the meditations of thy heart.
³¹ Thou, O king, didst behold, and, lo, a great image; and that image was mighty, and its brightness was surpassing, standing before thee, and the sight thereof was dreadful.
³² As for the image, its head was of fine gold, its hands and its breast and its arms were of silver, its belly and its thighs were of bronze,
³³ its legs were of iron, its feet partly of iron, and partly of clay.
³⁴ Thou didst behold until a stone was cut out of a mountain without hands, and it smote the image upon its feet of iron and clay, and brake them utterly in pieces.
³⁵ Then was the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold, broken in pieces together; and they became like the dust of a summer threshing-floor; and the force of the wind bore them away, and no place was found for them. And the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.
³⁶ This is the dream, and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.
³⁷ Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, strong, and mighty, and glorious, in every place
³⁸ where the children of men dwell. The beasts of the field, and the fowls of the heaven, and the fish of the sea, hath He given into thine hand, and hath made thee lord over all. Thou art this head of gold.
³⁹ And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, which is the silver; and a third kingdom, which is the bronze, which shall rule over all the earth.
⁴⁰ And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: inasmuch as iron doth grind down and subdue all things, so shall it grind down and subdue all things.
⁴¹ And whereas thou didst see the feet—
