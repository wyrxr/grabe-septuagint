ΚΕΦ. Δʹ. Εʹ. ΜΙΧΑΙΑΣ. 1483
12 σαν τὸν λογισμὸν Κυρίου, καὶ οὐ συνῆκαν τὴν βουλὴν αὐτοῦ, ὅτι
συνήγαγεν αὐτοὺς ὡς δράγματα ἅλωνος. 13 Ἀνάστα, καὶ ἀλόα αὐ-
τοὺς θύγατερ Σιὼν, ὅτι τὰ κέρατά σου θήσομαι σιδηρᾶ, καὶ τὰς
ὁπλάς σου θήσομαι χαλκᾶς· καὶ λεπτυνεῖς λαοὺς πολλοὺς, καὶ
ἀναθήσεις τῷ Κυρίῳ τὸ πλῆθος αὐτῶν, καὶ τὴν ἰσχὺν αὐτῶν τῷ
Κυρίῳ πάσης τῆς γῆς.

ΚΕΦ. Εʹ. V.

1 ΝΥΝ ἐμφραχθήσεται θυγάτηρ Ἐφραὶμ ἐμφραγμῷ, συνοχὴν
ἔταξεν ἐφ᾿ ἡμᾶς. ἐν ῥάβδῳ πατάξουσιν ἐπὶ σιαγόνα τὰς φυλὰς τοῦ
Ἰσραήλ. 2 Καὶ σὺ Βηθλεὲμ οἶκος τοῦ Ἐφραθὰ, ὀλιγοστὸς εἶ τοῦ
εἶναι ἐν χιλιάσιν Ἰούδα· ἐκ σοῦ μοι ἐξελεύσεται ἡγούμενος τοῦ
εἶναι εἰς ἄρχοντα ἐν τῷ Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ αἱ ἔξοδοι αὐτοῦ ἀπ᾿ ἀρχῆς
ἐξ ἡμερῶν αἰῶνος. 3 Διὰ τοῦτο δώσει αὐτοὺς, ἕως καιροῦ τικτού-
σης τέξεται, καὶ οἱ ἐπίλοιποι τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτῶν ἐπιστρέψου-
σιν ἐπὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραήλ. 4 Καὶ στήσεται καὶ ὄψεται, καὶ ποι-
μανεῖ τὸ ποίμνιον αὐτοῦ ἐν ἰσχύϊ Κύριος, καὶ ἐν τῇ δόξῃ τοῦ ὀ-
νόματος Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ αὐτῶν ὑπάρξουσι· διότι νῦν μεγαλυνθή-
σονται ἕως ἄκρων τῆς γῆς. 5 Καὶ ἔσται αὐτὴ ἡ εἰρήνη, ὅταν Ἀσ-
σύριος ἐπέλθῃ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ὑμῶν, καὶ ὅταν ἐπιβῇ ἐπὶ τὴν χώραν
ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐπεγερθήσονται ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν ἑπτὰ ποιμένες, καὶ ὀκτὼ
δήγματα ἀνθρώπων, 6 καὶ ποιμανοῦσι τὸν Ἀσσοὺρ ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ, καὶ
τὴν γῆν τοῦ Νεβρὼδ ἐν τῇ τάφρῳ αὐτῆς, καὶ ῥύσεται ἐκ τοῦ Ἀσ-
σοὺρ, ὅταν ἐπέλθῃ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ὑμῶν, καὶ ὅταν ἐπιβῇ ἐπὶ τὰ ὅρια
ὑμῶν. 7 Καὶ ἔσται τὸ ὑπόλειμμα τοῦ Ἰακὼβ ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν ἐν
μέσῳ λαῶν πολλῶν ὡς δρόσος παρὰ Κυρίου πίπτουσα, καὶ ὡς
ἄρνες ἐπ᾿ ἀγρωστιν, ὅπως μὴ συναχθῇ μηδεὶς, μηδὲ ὑποστῇ ἐν
υἱοῖς ἀνθρώπων. 8 Καὶ ἔσται τὸ ὑπόλειμμα τοῦ Ἰακὼβ ἐν τοῖς
ἔθνεσιν ἐν μέσῳ λαῶν πολλῶν ὡς λέων ἐν κτήνεσιν ἐν τῷ δρυμῷ,
καὶ ὡς σκύμνος ἐν ποιμνίοις προβάτων, ὃν τρόπον ὅταν διέλθῃ,
καὶ διαστείλας ἁρπάσῃ, καὶ μὴ ᾖ ὁ ἐξαιρούμενος· 9 ὑψωθήσεται ἡ
χείρ σου ἐπὶ τοὺς θλίβοντάς σε, καὶ πάντες οἱ ἐχθροί σου ἐξολε-
θρευθήσονται. 10 Καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, λέγει Κύριος, ἐξ-
ολεθρεύσω τοὺς ἵππους σου ἐκ μέσου σου, καὶ ἀπολῶ τὰ ἅρματά
σου, 11 καὶ ἐξολεθρεύσω τὰς πόλεις τῆς γῆς σου, καὶ ἐξαρῶ πάντα
12 τὰ ὀχυρώματά σου, καὶ ἐξαρῶ πάντα τὰ φάρμακά σου ἐκ τῶν
13 χειρῶν σου, καὶ ἀποφθεγγόμενοι οὐκ ἔσονται ἐν σοί. 14 Καὶ ἐξολε-
θρεύσω τὰ γλυπτά σου, καὶ τὰς στήλας σου ἐκ μέσου σου, καὶ
15 κόψω τὰ ἄλση σου ἐκ μέσου σου, καὶ ἀφανιῶ τὰς πόλεις σου, καὶ
ποιήσω ἐν θυμῷ καὶ ἐν ὀργῇ ἐκδίκησιν ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν, ἀνθ᾿ ὧν
οὐκ εἰσήκουσάν μου.

### Micah
#### Chapter 4
**12** ...knew not the thought of the Lord, neither understood they His counsel; for He hath gathered them as sheaves [for] the threshing floor.
**13** Arise, and thresh them, O daughter Zion, for I will make thy horns of iron, and thy hooves I will make of bronze; and thou shalt crush many peoples, and shalt consecrate their multitude unto the Lord, and their strength unto the Lord of all the earth.

#### Chapter 5
**1** Now shall the daughter of Ephraim be hedged in with a siege; a binding distress hath He set upon us. With a rod shall they smite upon the cheek the tribes of Israel.
**2** But thou, Bethlehem, house of Ephrathah, art too small to be among the thousands of Judah; [yet] out of thee shall He come forth unto Me Who is to be a leader, [even] a ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from the beginning, from the days of eternity.
**3** Therefore shall He give them up, until the time when she who travaileth shall bring forth; and the remnant of their brethren shall return unto the children of Israel.
**4** And He shall stand and oversee, and He shall shepherd His flock in the strength of the Lord, and in the glory of the Name of the Lord their God they shall abide; for now shall they be magnified even unto the uttermost parts of the earth.
**5** And this man shall be the peace. When the Assyrian shall come into your land, and when he shall tread upon your country, then shall there be raised up against him seven shepherds, and eight bites of men,
**6** and they shall shepherd Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod within her trenches; and He shall deliver [you] from the Assyrian, when he shall come into your land, and when he shall tread upon your borders.
**7** And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many peoples, among the nations, as dew falling from the Lord, and as lambs upon the grass; so that none shall gather [them], nor shall any resist among the sons of men.
**8** And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many peoples, among the nations, as a lion among the beasts of the forest, and as a young lion among the flocks of sheep; who, when he passeth through, and rendeth and teareth, there is none that can deliver.
**9** Thy hand shall be lifted up against thine oppressors, and all thine enemies shall be utterly destroyed.
**10** And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, that I will utterly destroy thy horses from the midst of thee, and I will abolish thy chariots,
**11** and I will utterly destroy the cities of thy land, and I will take away all
**12** thy strongholds, and I will take away all thy sorceries from thy
**13** hands, and soothsayers shall no longer be among thee.
**14** And I will utterly destroy thy graven images and thy pillars from the midst of thee,
**15** and I will cut down thy groves from the midst of thee, and I will utterly destroy thy cities; and I will execute in wrath and in fury vengeance among the nations, because they hearkened not unto Me.
