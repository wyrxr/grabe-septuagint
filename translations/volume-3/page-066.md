**ΨΑΛΜ. ΠΣʹ. LXXXVI.**
3 σκηνώματα Ἰακώβ. Δεδοξασμένα ἐλαλήθη περὶ σοῦ ἡ πόλις τοῦ
4 Θεοῦ. Διάψαλμα. Μνησθήσομαι Ῥαὰβ καὶ Βαβυλῶνος τοῖς γινώσκουσί με· (καὶ) ἰδοὺ ἀλλόφυλοι, καὶ Τύρος, καὶ λαὸς Αἰθιόπων,
5 οὗτοι ἐγενήθησαν ἐκεῖ. Μήτι Σιὼν ἐρεῖ· ἄνθρωπος καὶ ἄνθρωπος
6 ἐγενήθη ἐν αὐτῇ; καὶ αὐτὸς ἐθεμελίωσεν αὐτὴν ὁ ὕψιστος. Κύριος διηγήσεται ἐν γραφῇ λαῶν καὶ ἀρχόντων, τούτων τῶν γεγενημένων ἐν αὐτῇ.
7 Διάψαλμα. Ὡς εὐφραινομένων πάντων ἡ κατοικία ἐν σοί.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ΠΖ΄. LXXXVII.**

ὨΔΗ ψαλμοῦ τοῖς υἱοῖς Κορὲ εἰς τὸ τέλος, ὑπὲρ Μαελέθ τοῦ ἀποκριθῆναι, συνέσεως Αἰμὰν τῷ Ἐσδραΐτῃ.
1 Κύριε ὁ Θεὸς τῆς σωτηρίας μου, ἡμέρας ἐκέκραξα, καὶ ἐν νυκτὶ ἐναντίον σου·
2 εἰσελθέτω ἐνώπιόν σου ἡ προσευχή μου, κλῖνον τὸ οὖς σου εἰς τὴν δέησίν μου (Κύριε).
3 Ὅτι ἐπλήσθη κακῶν ἡ ψυχή μου, καὶ ἡ ζωή μου τῷ ἅδῃ ἤγγισε.
4 Προσελογίσθην μετὰ τῶν καταβαινόντων εἰς λάκκον· ἐγενήθην ὡσεὶ ἄνθρωπος ἀβοήθητος, ἐν νεκροῖς ἐλεύθερος·
5 ὡσεὶ τραυματίαι καθεύδοντες ἐν τάφῳ, ὧν οὐκ ἐμνήσθης ἔτι, καὶ αὐτοὶ ἐκ τῆς χειρός σου ἀπώσθησαν.
6 Ἔθεντό με ἐν λάκκῳ κατωτάτῳ, ἐν σκοτεινοῖς καὶ ἐν σκιᾷ θανάτου.
7 Ἐπ’ ἐμὲ ἐπεστηρίχθη ὁ θυμός σου, καὶ πάντας τοὺς μετεωρισμούς σου ἐπήγαγες ἐπ’ ἐμέ.
8 Διάψαλμα. Ἐμάκρυνας τοὺς γνωστούς μου ἀπ’ ἐμοῦ·
9 ἔθεντό με βδέλυγμα ἑαυτοῖς· παρεδόθην καὶ οὐκ ἐξεπορευόμην.
10 Οἱ ὀφθαλμοί μου ἠσθένησαν ἀπὸ πτωχείας· ἐκέκραξα πρὸς σὲ Κύριε ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν, διεπέτασα πρὸς σὲ τὰς χεῖράς μου.
11 Μὴ τοῖς νεκροῖς ποιήσεις θαυμάσια; ἢ ἰατροὶ ἀναστήσουσι, καὶ ἐξομολογήσονταί σοι;
12 Μὴ διηγήσεται ἐν τῷ τάφῳ τὸ ἔλεός σου, καὶ τὴν ἀλήθειάν σου ἐν τῇ ἀπωλείᾳ;
13 Μὴ γνωσθήσεται ἐν τῷ σκότει τὰ θαυμάσιά σου, καὶ ἡ δικαιοσύνη σου ἐν γῇ ἐπιλελησμένῃ;
14 Καὶ ἐγὼ πρὸς σὲ Κύριε ἐκέκραξα, καὶ τὸ πρωΐ ἡ προσευχή μου προφθάσει σε.
15 Ἵνατί Κύριε ἀπωθεῖς τὴν ψυχήν μου; ἀποστρέφεις τὸ πρόσωπόν σου ἀπ’ ἐμοῦ;
16 Πτωχός εἰμι ἐγώ, καὶ ἐν κόποις ἐκ νεότητός μου·
17 ὑψωθεὶς δὲ ἐταπεινώθην καὶ ἐξηπορήθην. Ἐπ’ ἐμὲ διῆλθον αἱ ὀργαί σου,
18 καὶ οἱ φοβερισμοί σου ἐξετάραξάν με· ἐκύκλωσάν με ὡς ὕδωρ ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν, περιέσχον με ἅμα.
19 Ἐμάκρυψας ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ φίλον καὶ πλησίον· καὶ τοὺς γνωστούς μου ἀπὸ ταλαιπωρίας.

**PSALM LXXXVI. (Cont.)**
3 ...tabernacles of Jacob.
Glorious things are spoken of thee,
O city of God.
4 Selah. I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon
unto them that know me:
And behold, the Philistines, and Tyre,
With the people of the Ethiopians,
These were born there.
5 Shall it not be said unto Zion,
‘This man and that man was born in her?’
And He Himself, the Most High, hath established her.
6 The Lord shall recount in the writing of the peoples and of the princes,
[Even] of those that were born in her.
Selah.
7 As of them that rejoice,
Is the dwelling of all within thee.

**PSALM LXXXVII.**

A Song, a Psalm for the Sons of Korah. For the End, concerning Mahalath to answer,
A contemplative Psalm of Heman the Ezrahite.

1 O Lord, the God of my salvation,
By day have I cried, and in the night before Thee.
2 Let my prayer come in before Thee;
Incline Thine ear unto my supplication, [O Lord].
3 For my soul is full of troubles,
And my life draweth nigh unto Hades.
4 I am counted with them that go down into the pit;
I am become as a man without help,
Free among the dead;
5 As the wounded that sleep in the grave,
Of whom Thou rememberest no more,
And they themselves are thrust away from Thy hand.
6 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit,
In dark places, and in the shadow of death.
7 Upon me Thy wrath hath been established,
And all Thy waves hast Thou brought upon me.
Selah.
8 Thou hast put far from me my acquaintances;
9 They have made me an abomination unto themselves;
I was delivered up, and I went not forth.
10 Mine eyes have become weak from poverty;
I cried unto Thee, O Lord, all the day long,
I stretched forth my hands unto Thee.
11 Shalt Thou work wonders for the dead?
Or shall physicians raise [them], and confess Thee?
12 Shall Thy mercy be declared in the grave,
Or Thy truth in destruction?
13 Shall Thy wonders be known in the darkness,
And Thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
14 But I, O Lord, have cried unto Thee,
And early in the morning shall my prayer come before Thee.
15 Wherefore, O Lord, dost Thou cast off my soul?
Dost Thou turn Thy face away from me?
16 I am poor, and in toils from my youth;
17 Though exalted, I was humbled and brought to despair.
Upon me Thy wrath hath passed,
18 And Thy terrors have troubled me;
They have surrounded me like water all the day long,
They have encompassed me together.
19 Thou hast hidden from me friend and neighbour;
And my acquaintances, from tribulation.
