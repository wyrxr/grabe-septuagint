ἐν παντὶ καιρῷ, διαπαντὸς ἡ αἴνεσις αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ στόματί μου·
3 ἐν τῷ Κυρίῳ ἐπαινεθήσεται ἡ ψυχή μου· ἀκουσάτωσαν πραεῖς καὶ
4 εὐφρανθήτωσαν. Μεγαλύνατε τὸν Κύριον σὺν ἐμοί, καὶ ὑψώσωμεν
5 τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό. Ἐξεζήτησα τὸν Κύριον, καὶ ἐπήκουσέ
6 μου, καὶ ἐκ πασῶν τῶν θλίψεών μου ἐῤῥύσατό με. Προσέλθατε
7 πρὸς αὐτὸν καὶ φωτίσθητε, καὶ τὰ πρόσωπα ὑμῶν οὐ μὴ
καταισχυνθῆ. Οὗτος ὁ πτωχὸς ἐκέκραξε, καὶ ὁ Κύριος εἰσήκουσεν
8 αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐκ πασῶν τῶν θλίψεων αὐτοῦ ἔσωσεν αὐτόν. Παρεμβαλεῖ
ἄγγελος Κυρίου κύκλῳ τῶν φοβουμένων αὐτόν, καὶ ῥύσεται
9 αὐτούς. Γεύσασθε καὶ ἴδετε, ὅτι χρηστὸς ὁ Κύριος· μακάριος
10 ἀνήρ, ὃς ἐλπίζει ἐπ᾿ αὐτόν. Φοβήθητε τὸν Κύριον πάντες οἱ
ἅγιοι αὐτοῦ· ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν ὑστέρημα τοῖς φοβουμένοις αὐτόν.
11 Πλούσιοι ἐπτώχευσαν καὶ ἐπείνασαν· οἱ δὲ ἐκζητοῦντες τὸν Κύριον
12 οὐκ ἐλαττωθήσονται παντὸς ἀγαθοῦ. Διάψαλμα. Δεῦτε τέκνα
13 ἀκούσατέ μου, φόβον Κυρίου διδάξω ὑμᾶς. Τίς ἐστιν ἄνθρωπος
14 ὁ θέλων ζωήν, ἀγαπῶν ἡμέρας ἰδεῖν ἀγαθάς; Παῦσον τὴν
γλῶσσάν σου ἀπὸ κακοῦ, καὶ χείλη σου τοῦ μὴ λαλῆσαι δόλον·
15 Ἔκκλινον ἀπὸ κακοῦ, καὶ ποίησον ἀγαθόν. Ζήτησον εἰρήνην καὶ
16 δίωξον αὐτήν. Ὀφθαλμοὶ Κυρίου ἐπὶ δικαίους, καὶ ὦτα αὐτοῦ
17 εἰς δέησιν αὐτῶν· πρόσωπον δὲ Κυρίου ἐπὶ ποιοῦντας κακά, τοῦ
18 ἐξολοθρεῦσαι ἐκ γῆς τὸ μνημόσυνον αὐτῶν. Ἐκέκραξαν οἱ δίκαιοι,
καὶ ὁ Κύριος εἰσήκουσεν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐκ πασῶν τῶν θλίψεων αὐτῶν
19 ἐῤῥύσατο αὐτούς. Ἐγγὺς Κύριος τοῖς συντετριμμένοις τὴν
20 καρδίαν, καὶ τοὺς ταπεινοὺς τῷ πνεύματι σώσει. Πολλαὶ αἱ θλίψεις
τῶν δικαίων· καὶ ἐκ πασῶν αὐτῶν ῥύσεται αὐτοὺς ὁ Κύριος.
21 Φυλάσσει Κύριος πάντα τὰ ὀστᾶ αὐτῶν· ἓν ἐξ αὐτῶν οὐ συντριβήσεται.
22 Θάνατος ἁμαρτωλῶν πονηρός, καὶ οἱ μισοῦντες τὸν δίκαιον
23 πλημμελήσουσι· λυτρώσεται Κύριος ψυχὰς δούλων αὐτοῦ,
καὶ οὐ μὴ πλημμελήσουσι πάντες οἱ ἐλπίζοντες ἐπ᾿ αὐτόν.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ΛΔ´. XXXIV.**

1 (ΨΑΛΜΟΣ) τῷ Δαυΐδ. Δίκασον Κύριε τοὺς ἀδικοῦντάς με·
2 πολέμησον τοὺς πολεμοῦντάς με. Ἐπιλαβοῦ ὅπλου καὶ θυρεοῦ,
3 καὶ ἀνάστηθι εἰς βοήθειάν μου· ἔκχεον ῥομφαίαν (σου), καὶ σύγκλεισον
ἐξ ἐναντίας τῶν καταδιωκόντων με· εἶπον τῇ ψυχῇ μου,

**PSALM XXXIII.**

2 I will bless the Lord at all times;
His praise shall continually be in my mouth.
3 In the Lord shall my soul make her boast;
Let the meek hear [thereof], and be glad.
4 O magnify the Lord with me,
And let us exalt His name together.
5 I sought the Lord, and He heard me,
And delivered me from all my troubles.
6 Draw near unto Him, and be enlightened,
And your faces shall not be ashamed.
7 This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him,
And saved him out of all his troubles.
8 The Angel of the Lord shall encamp round about them that fear Him,
And shall deliver them.
9 O taste and see that the Lord is good;
Blessed is the man that hopeth in Him.
10 O fear the Lord, ye His saints,
For there is no want to them that fear Him.
11 The rich have grown poor and hungered;
But they that seek the Lord shall not lack any good thing. *Selah.*
12 Come, ye children, hearken unto me;
I will teach you the fear of the Lord.
13 What man is he that desireth life,
And loveth [to see] good days?
14 Keep thy tongue from evil,
And thy lips from speaking guile.
15 Depart from evil, and do good;
Seek peace, and pursue it.
16 The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous,
And His ears [are open] unto their supplication.
17 But the face of the Lord is against them that do evil,
To utterly destroy their remembrance from the earth.
18 The righteous cried, and the Lord heard them,
And delivered them out of all their troubles.
19 The Lord is nigh unto them that are broken in heart,
And will save the humble in spirit.
20 Many are the afflictions of the righteous,
But out of all of them the Lord shall deliver them.
21 The Lord keepeth all their bones;
Not one of them shall be broken.
22 The death of sinners is evil;
And they that hate the righteous shall be held guilty.
23 The Lord shall redeem the souls of His servants,
And none of them that hope in Him shall be found guilty.

**PSALM XXXIV.**
*A Psalm of David.*

1 Plead [my cause], O Lord, with them that wrong me;
Fight against them that fight against me.
2 Take hold of [Thy] weapon and shield,
And arise for my help.
3 Draw forth Thy sword (of Thine),
And bar the way against them that pursue me;
Say unto my soul,
