**ΚΕΦ. Δʹ.**
Βλέποντες ἐπὶ πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν· καὶ ἀπεκρίθην, καὶ εἶπα πρὸς αὐτόν· 11 Τί αἱ δύο ἔλαιαι αὗται, αἱ ἐκ δεξιῶν τῆς λυχνίας καὶ ἐξ εὐωνύμων; 12 Καὶ ἐπηρώτησα ἐκ δευτέρου, καὶ εἶπα πρὸς αὐτόν· Τί οἱ δύο κλάδοι τῶν ἐλαιῶν οἱ ἐν ταῖς χερσὶ τῶν δύο μυζωτήρων τῶν χρυσῶν τῶν ἐπιχεόντων, καὶ ἐπαναγόντων τὰς ἐπαρυστρίδας τὰς χρυσᾶς; 13 Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς μέ· Οὐκ οἶδας τί ἐστι ταῦτα; Καὶ εἶπα· Οὐχί Κύριε. 14 Καὶ εἶπεν· Οὗτοι οἱ δύο υἱοὶ τῆς πιότητος παρεστήκασι τῷ Κυρίῳ πάσης τῆς γῆς.

**ΚΕΦ. Εʹ. V.**
Καὶ ἐπέστρεψα, καὶ ἦρα τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς μου, καὶ ἴδον, καὶ ἰδοὺ δρέπανον πετόμενον. 1 Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς μέ· Τί σὺ βλέπεις; 2 Καὶ εἶπα· Ὁρῶ ἐγὼ δρέπανον πετόμενον· μῆκος πήχεων εἴκοσι, καὶ πλάτος πήχεων δέκα. 3 Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς μέ· Αὕτη ἡ ἀρὰ ἡ ἐκπορευομένη ἐπὶ πρόσωπον πάσης τῆς γῆς· διότι πᾶς ὁ κλέπτης ἐκ τούτου ἕως θανάτου ἐκδικηθήσεται, καὶ πᾶς ὁ ἐπίορκος ἐκ τούτου ἕως θανάτου ἐκδικηθήσεται. 4 Καὶ ἐξοίσω αὐτό, λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ, καὶ εἰσελεύσεται εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ κλέπτου, καὶ εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ ὀμνύοντος τῷ ὀνόματί μου ἐπὶ ψεύδει, καὶ καταλύσει ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ, καὶ συντελέσει αὐτόν, καὶ τὰ ξύλα αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοὺς λίθους αὐτοῦ. 5 Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ὁ ἄγγελος ὁ λαλῶν ἐν ἐμοί, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς μέ· Ἀνάβλεψον τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς σου, καὶ ἴδε τὸ ἐκπορευόμενον τοῦτο. 6 Καὶ εἶπα· Τί ἐστι; Καὶ εἶπε· Τοῦτο τὸ μέτρον τὸ ἐκπορευόμενον. Καὶ εἶπεν· Αὕτη ἡ ἀδικία αὐτῶν ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ. 7 Καὶ ἰδοὺ τάλαντον μολίβου ἐξαιρόμενον· καὶ ἰδοὺ γυνὴ μία ἐκάθητο ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ μέτρου. 8 Καὶ εἶπεν· Αὕτη ἐστὶν ἡ ἀνομία· καὶ ἐῤῥίψεν αὐτὴν εἰς μέσον τοῦ μέτρου, καὶ ἐῤῥίψε τὸν λίθον τοῦ μολίβου εἰς τὸ στόμα αὐτῆς. 9 Καὶ ἦρα τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς μου, καὶ ἴδον, καὶ ἰδοὺ δύο γυναῖκες ἐκπορευόμεναι, καὶ πνεῦμα ἐν ταῖς πτέρυξιν αὐτῶν, καὶ αὗται εἶχον πτέρυγας ὡς πτέρυγας ἔποπος· καὶ ἀνέλαβον τὸ μέτρον ἀναμέσον τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἀναμέσον τοῦ οὐρανοῦ. 10 Καὶ εἶπα πρὸς τὸν ἄγγελον τὸν λαλοῦντα ἐν ἐμοί· Ποῦ αὗται ἀποφέρουσι τὸ μέτρον; 11 Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς μέ· Οἰκοδομῆσαι αὐτῷ οἰκίαν ἐν γῇ Βαβυλῶνος, καὶ ἑτοιμάσαι, καὶ θήσουσιν αὐτὸ ἐκεῖ ἐπὶ τὴν ἑτοιμασίαν αὐτοῦ.

**Zechariah [Chapter] 4.**

**11** ...surveying all the earth. Then answered I and said unto him, "What are these two olive trees, which stand on the right side of the lampstand and on the left?"

**12** And I asked again a second time, and said unto him, "What are these two branches of the olive trees, which are in the hands of the two golden spouts that pour forth and supply the golden bowls?"

**13** And he said unto me, "Knowest thou not what these be?" And I said, "Nay, my Lord."

**14** And he said, "These are the two anointed ones, that stand before the Lord of all the earth."

**Zechariah [Chapter] 5.**

**1** Then I returned, and lifted up mine eyes, and I saw, and behold, a flying scroll.

**2** And he said unto me, "What seest thou?" And I answered, "I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits, and its breadth ten cubits."

**3** Then said he unto me, "This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of all the earth: for every thief shall be punished unto death according to it, and every perjurer shall be punished unto death according to it."

**4** I will bring it forth, saith the Lord Almighty, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by My name; and it shall abide in the midst of his house, and shall utterly consume it, with its timber and its stones.

**5** And the angel that spake with me went forth, and said unto me, "Lift up thine eyes, and behold this that goeth forth."

**6** And I said, "What is it?" And he said, "This is the measure that goeth forth." And he said, "This is their iniquity throughout all the land."

**7** And behold, a talent of lead was lifted up; and behold, there was a woman sitting in the midst of the measure.

**8** And he said, "This is Wickedness." And he cast her into the midst of the measure, and he cast the stone of lead upon her mouth.

**9** Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold, two women went forth, and the wind was in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a hoopoe; and they lifted up the measure between the earth and between the heaven.

**10** And I said unto the angel that spake with me, "Whither do these carry the measure?"

**11** And he said unto me, "To build it a house in the land of Babylon, and to prepare it; and there shall they set it upon its [prepared] base."
