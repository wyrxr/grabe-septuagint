**11** δάρ᾽ εὐφρανθήσονται οἱ κατοικοῦντες πέτραν, ἀπ᾽ ἄκρου τῶν
**12** ὀρέων βοήσουσιν. Δώσουσι τῷ Θεῷ δόξαν, τὰς ἀρετὰς αὐτοῦ
**13** ἐν ταῖς νήσοις ἀναγγελοῦσι. Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τῶν δυνάμεων ἐξελεύσεται, καὶ συντρίψει πόλεμον, ἐπεγερεῖ ζῆλον, σημανεῖ καὶ
**14** βοήσεται ἐπὶ τοὺς ἐχθροὺς αὐτοῦ μετὰ ἰσχύος. Ἐσιώπησα, μὴ
καὶ ἀεὶ σιωπήσομαι καὶ ἀνέξομαι ; ἐκαρτέρησα ὡς ἡ τίκτουσα,
**15** ἐκστήσω καὶ ξηρανῶ ἅμα, ἐρημώσω ὄρη καὶ βουνούς, καὶ πάν-
τα χόρτον αὐτῶν ξηρανῶ, καὶ θήσω ποταμοὺς εἰς νήσους, καὶ
**16** ἕλη ξηρανῶ. Καὶ ἄξω τυφλοὺς ἐν ὁδῷ ᾗ οὐκ ἔγνωσαν, καὶ τρί-
βους, ἃς οὐκ ᾔδεισαν, πατῆσαι ποιήσω αὐτούς· ποιήσω αὐτοῖς
**17** τὸ σκότος εἰς φῶς, καὶ τὰ σκολιὰ εἰς εὐθεῖαν· ταῦτα τὰ ῥή-
ματα ἃ ποιήσω, καὶ οὐκ ἐγκαταλείψω αὐτούς. Αὐτοὶ δὲ ἀπε-
στράφησαν εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω· αἰσχυνθήτε αἰσχύνην οἱ πεποιθότες
**18** ἐπὶ τοῖς γλυπτοῖς, οἱ λέγοντες τοῖς χωνευτοῖς, ὑμεῖς ἐστε θεοὶ
ἡμῶν. Οἱ κωφοὶ ἀκούσατε, καὶ οἱ τυφλοὶ ἀναβλέψατε ἰδεῖν.
**19** Καὶ τίς τυφλὸς ἀλλ᾽ ἢ οἱ παῖδές μου, καὶ κωφοὶ ἀλλ᾽ ἢ οἱ
κυριεύοντες αὐτῶν· καὶ ἐτυφλώθησαν οἱ δοῦλοι τοῦ Θεοῦ.
**20** Ἴδετε πλεονάκις, καὶ οὐκ ἐφυλάξασθε· ἠνοιγμένα τὰ ὦτα, καὶ
**21** οὐκ ἠκούσατε. Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἐβουλεύσατο ἵνα δικαιωθῇ, καὶ
**22** μεγαλύνῃ αἴνεσιν. Καὶ ἰδόν, ἐγένετο ὁ λαὸς πεπρονομευμένος,
καὶ διηρπασμένος· ἡ γὰρ παγὶς ἐν τοῖς ταμιείοις πανταχοῦ, καὶ
ἐν οἴκοις ἅμα, ὅπου ἔκρυψαν αὐτούς, ἐγένοντο εἰς προνομήν· καὶ
οὐκ ἦν ὁ ἐξαιρούμενος ἅρπαγμα, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ λέγων, ἀπόδος.
**23** Τίς ἐν ὑμῖν ὃς ἐνωτιεῖται ταῦτα ; προσέξει καὶ εἰσακούσεται εἰς
τὰ ἐπερχόμενα. Τίς ἔδωκεν εἰς διαρπαγὴν Ἰακὼβ καὶ Ἰσραὴλ τοῖς
**24** προνομεύουσιν αὐτόν ; οὐχὶ ὁ Θεὸς ᾧ ἡμάρτοσαν αὐτῷ, καὶ οὐκ
ἐβούλοντο ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὐτοῦ πορεύεσθαι, οὐδὲ ἀκούειν τοῦ
**25** νόμου αὐτοῦ ; Καὶ ἐπήγαγεν ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς ὀργὴν θυμοῦ αὐτοῦ,
καὶ κατίσχυσεν ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς πόλεμος, καὶ οἱ συμφλέγοντες αὐτοὺς κύκλῳ, καὶ οὐκ ἔγνωσαν ἕκαστος αὐτῶν, οὐδὲ ἔθεντο ἐπὶ
ψυχὴν, καὶ ἀνήφθη ἐν αὐτοῖς.

ΚΕΦ. ΜΓ΄. XLIII.

**1** ΚΑΙ νῦν οὕτως λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὁ ποιήσας σε Ἰακώβ,
καὶ ὁ πλάσας σε Ἰσραήλ, μὴ φοβοῦ, ὅτι ἐλυτρωσάμην σε, ἐ-
**2** μός τὸ ὄνομά σου· ἐμὸς εἶ σύ. Καὶ ἐὰν διαβαίνῃς δι᾽

#### Chapter 42

**11** -dar; the inhabitants of the rock shall rejoice;
    from the top of the mountains shall they cry out.
**12** They shall give glory unto God,
    and shall declare His praises in the islands.
**13** The Lord God of hosts shall go forth,
    and He shall break war;
    He shall stir up zeal, and shall shout and cry out
    against His enemies with strength.
**14** I have been silent; shall I also always be silent and endure?
    I have been patient as one giving birth;
    I shall lay waste and dry up at once.
**15** I shall make mountains and hills desolate,
    and dry up all their grass;
    and I shall turn rivers into islands, and shall dry up marshes.
**16** And I shall lead the blind in a way which they knew not,
    and make them to tread paths which they had not known;
    I shall make for them
**17** the darkness into light, and the crooked places straight.
    These are the words which I shall perform, and I will not forsake them.
    But they have turned back;
    be ye ashamed with shame, ye that trust
**18** in graven images, and say unto the molten images,
    "Ye are our gods."
    Hearken, ye deaf, and look up to see, ye blind!
**19** And who is blind, but My servants?
    Or deaf, but they that rule over them?
    And the servants of God were made blind.
**20** Ye have seen many things, and have not observed;
    your ears were opened, yet ye have not heard.
**21** The Lord God hath purposed that He might be justified,
    and that He might magnify praise.
**22** And behold, the people became plundered and seized;
    for the snare was in the storerooms everywhere,
    and in houses altogether, where they hid them,
    they became for a spoil;
    and there was none that rescued the plunder,
    nor any that said, "Restore it!"
**23** Who among you is there that will give ear to these things?
    Who will attend and hearken unto the things to come?
    Who hath given Jacob for a plunder,
    and Israel unto them
**24** that plunder him?
    Hath not the Lord God, against Whom they have sinned,
    and in Whose ways they would not walk,
    nor hearken unto
**25** His law?
    Therefore hath He poured upon them the fury of His anger,
    and the strength of battle;
    and they that burn them round about;
    yet none of them knew, nor laid it to heart,
    but it was kindled within them.

#### Chapter 43

**1** But now thus saith the Lord God,
    He that created thee, O Jacob,
    and He that formed thee, O Israel:
    "Fear thou not, for I have redeemed thee;
    My name is thine; thou art Mine.
**2** And if thou pass through
