τὰ ἔργα μου. Τεσσαράκοντα ἔτη προσώχθισα τῇ γενεᾷ ἐκείνῃ, 10
καὶ εἶπον· ἀεὶ πλανῶνται τῇ καρδίᾳ, αὐτοὶ δὲ οὐκ ἔγνωσαν τὰς
ὁδοὺς μου· ὡς ὤμοσα ἐν τῇ ὀργῇ μου, εἰ εἰσελεύσονται εἰς τὴν 11
κατάπαυσίν μου.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ϟΕʹ. XCV.**
ΩΔΗ τῷ Δαυΐδ, ὅτε ὁ οἶκος ᾠκοδομεῖτο μετὰ τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν.
Ἄσατε τῷ Κυρίῳ ᾄσμα καινόν, ᾄσατε τῷ Κυρίῳ πᾶσα ἡ 1
γῆ· ᾄσατε τῷ Κυρίῳ, εὐλογήσατε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ· εὐαγγελίζεσθε 2
ἡμέραν ἐξ ἡμέρας τὸ σωτήριον αὐτοῦ. Ἀναγγείλατε ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι 3
τὴν δόξαν αὐτοῦ, ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς λαοῖς τὰ θαυμάσια αὐτοῦ. Ὅτι 4
μέγας Κύριος καὶ αἰνετὸς σφόδρα· φοβερὸς ἔστιν ἐπὶ πάντας τοὺς
θεούς. Ὅτι πάντες οἱ θεοὶ τῶν ἐθνῶν δαιμόνια· ὁ δὲ Κύριος τοὺς 5
οὐρανοὺς ἐποίησεν. Ἐξομολόγησις καὶ ὡραιότης ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ· 6
ἁγιωσύνη καὶ μεγαλοπρέπεια ἐν τῷ ἁγιάσματι αὐτοῦ. Ἐνέγκατε 7
τῷ Κυρίῳ αἱ πατριαὶ τῶν ἐθνῶν, ἐνέγκατε τῷ Κυρίῳ δόξαν καὶ
τιμήν· ἐνέγκατε τῷ Κυρίῳ δόξαν ὀνόματι αὐτοῦ· ἄρατε θυσίας, 8
καὶ εἰσπορεύεσθε εἰς τὰς αὐλὰς αὐτοῦ. Προσκυνήσατε τῷ Κυρίῳ 9
ἐν αὐλῇ ἁγίᾳ αὐτοῦ· σαλευθήτω ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ πᾶσα ἡ γῆ.
Εἴπατε ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν, ὅτι Κύριος ἐβασίλευσε· καὶ γὰρ κατώρθωσε 10
τὴν οἰκουμένην, ἥτις οὐ σαλευθήσεται· κρινεῖ λαοὺς ἐν εὐθύτητι.
Εὐφραινέσθωσαν οἱ οὐρανοί, καὶ ἀγαλλιάσθω ἡ γῆ· σαλευθήτω 11
ἡ θάλασσα καὶ τὸ πλήρωμα αὐτῆς. Χαρήσεται τὰ πεδία καὶ πάντα 12
τὰ ἐν αὐτοῖς· τότε ἀγαλλιάσονται πάντα τὰ ξύλα τοῦ δρυμοῦ
ἀπὸ προσώπου Κυρίου, ὅτι ἔρχεται, ὅτι ἔρχεται κρῖναι τὴν γῆν· 13
κρινεῖ τὴν οἰκουμένην ἐν δικαιοσύνῃ, καὶ λαοὺς ἐν τῇ ἀληθείᾳ αὐτοῦ.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ϟςʹ. XCVI.**
Τῷ Δαυΐδ, ὅτε ἡ γῆ αὐτοῦ καθίσταται.
Ὁ Κύριος ἐβασίλευσε, ἀγαλλιάσθω ἡ γῆ· εὐφρανθήτωσαν νῆσοι 1
πολλαί. Νεφέλη καὶ γνόφος κύκλῳ αὐτοῦ· δικαιοσύνη καὶ κρῖμα 2
κατόρθωσις τοῦ θρόνου αὐτοῦ. Πῦρ ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ προπορεύσεται, 3
καὶ φλογιεῖ κύκλῳ τοὺς ἐχθροὺς αὐτοῦ· ἔφαναν αἱ ἀστραπαὶ αὐτοῦ 4
τῇ οἰκουμένῃ, εἶδε καὶ ἐσαλεύθη ἡ γῆ. Τὰ ὄρη ἐτάκησαν ὡσεὶ κηρὸς 5

**PSALM XCIV.**
(continued)

...My works.
10 For forty years was I grieved with that generation,
   And I said, "They do always err in their heart,
   And they themselves have not known My ways."
11 As I swore in My wrath, "If they shall enter into My rest."

**PSALM XCV.**
A Song of David, when the House was built after the Captivity.

1 O sing unto the Lord a new song;
   Sing unto the Lord, all the earth.
2 Sing unto the Lord, bless His Name;
   Show forth His salvation from day to day.
3 Declare His glory among the nations,
   Among all peoples His wondrous works.
4 For the Lord is great and greatly to be praised;
   He is terrible above all gods.
5 For all the gods of the nations are demons;
   But the Lord made the heavens.
6 Praise and beauty are before Him;
   Holiness and majesty are in His sanctuary.
7 Bring unto the Lord, O families of the nations,
   Bring unto the Lord glory and honour.
8 Bring unto the Lord the glory of His Name;
   Bring sacrifices, and enter into His courts.
9 Worship the Lord in His holy court;
   Let all the earth tremble before His presence.
10 Say among the nations that the Lord hath reigned;
    For He hath also established the world, which shall not be moved;
    He shall judge the peoples with uprightness.
11 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad;
    Let the sea be moved, and the fullness thereof.
12 The fields shall be joyful, and all that is in them;
    Then shall all the trees of the forest rejoice
13 Before the presence of the Lord, for He cometh, for He cometh to judge the earth;
    He shall judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with His truth.

**PSALM XCVI.**
A Psalm of David, when his land was established.

1 The Lord hath reigned, let the earth rejoice;
   Let many islands be glad.
2 Cloud and thick darkness are round about Him;
   Righteousness and judgment are the foundation of His throne.
3 Fire shall go before Him,
   And shall consume His enemies round about.
4 His lightnings shone unto the world,
   The earth saw and trembled.
5 The mountains melted like wax from before
