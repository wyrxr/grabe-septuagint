ΚΕΦ. ΚΖ΄. Ι Ε Ρ Ε Μ Ι Α Σ 1261
οἱ καιροὶ αὐτῆς· ἀνοίξατε τὰς ἀποθήκας αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐρευνή-
σατε αὐτὴν ὡς σπήλαιον, καὶ ἐξολεθρεύσατε αὐτήν· μὴ γενέ-
σθω αὐτῆς κατάλειμμα, ἀναξηράνατε αὐτῆς πάντας τοὺς καρποὺς,
27 καὶ καταβητωσαν εἰς σφαγὴν· οὐαὶ αὐτοῖς, ὅτι ἥκει ἡ ἡμέρα
    αὐτῶν, καὶ καιρὸς ἐκδικήσεως αὐτῶν.
28 Φωνὴ φευγόντων, καὶ ἀνασωζομένων ἐκ γῆς Βαβυλῶνος, τοῦ
    ἀναγγεῖλαι εἰς Σιὼν τὴν ἐκδίκησιν παρὰ Κυρίου Θεοῦ ἡμῶν,
    ἐκδίκησιν ναοῦ αὐτοῦ.
29 Παραγγείλατε ἐπὶ Βαβυλῶνα πολλούς, παντὶ ἐντείνοντι τόξον,
    παρεμβάλετε ἐπ᾿ αὐτὴν κυκλόθεν· μὴ ἔστω αὐτῆς ἀνασωζόμενος,
    ἀνταπόδοτε αὐτῇ κατὰ τὰ ἔργα αὐτῆς· κατὰ πάντα ὅσα
    ἐποίησε, ποιήσατε αὐτῇ, ὅτι πρὸς τὸν Κύριον ἀντέστη Θεὸν ἅγιον
    τοῦ Ἰσραήλ.
30 Διὰ τοῦτο πεσοῦνται οἱ νεανίσκοι αὐτῆς ἐν ταῖς πλατείαις
    αὐτῆς, καὶ πάντες οἱ ἄνδρες οἱ πολεμισταὶ αὐτῆς ῥιφήσονται
    ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, εἶπε Κύριος.
31 Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ πρὸς σὲ τὴν ὑβρίστριαν, λέγει Κύριος τῶν δυνάμεων,
    ὅτι ἥκει ἡ ἡμέρα σου, καὶ ὁ καιρὸς τῆς ἐκδικήσεώς σου,
32 καὶ ἀσθενήσει ἡ ὕβρις σου, καὶ πεσεῖται, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ὁ
    ἀνιστῶν αὐτήν· καὶ ἀνάψω πῦρ ἐν τῷ δρυμῷ αὐτῆς· καὶ
    καταφάγεται πάντα τὰ κύκλῳ αὐτῆς.
33 Τάδε λέγει Κύριος τῶν δυνάμεων, καταδεδυνάστευνται οἱ υἱοὶ
    Ἰσραήλ, καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰούδα, ἅμα πάντες οἱ αἰχμαλωτεύσαντες
    αὐτοὺς κατεδυνάστευσαν αὐτούς, ὅτι οὐκ ἠθέλησαν ἐξαποστεῖλαι
    αὐτούς.
34 Καὶ ὁ λυτρούμενος αὐτοὺς ἰσχυρός, Κύριος παντοκράτωρ
    ὄνομα αὐτῷ· κρίσιν κρινεῖ πρὸς τοὺς ἀντιδίκους αὐτοῦ, ὅπως
    ἐξάγῃ τὴν γῆν·
35 καὶ παροξυνεῖ τοῖς κατοικοῦσι Βαβυλῶνα μάχαιραν ἐπὶ τοὺς
    Χαλδαίους, φησὶ Κύριος, καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας Βαβυλῶνα,
    καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς μεγιστᾶνας αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς συνετοὺς αὐτῆς·
36 μάχαιραν ἐπὶ τὰ μαντεῖα αὐτῆς, μάχαιραν ἐπὶ τοὺς μαχητὰς
    αὐτῆς, καὶ παραλυθήσονται· μάχαιραν ἐπὶ τοὺς ἵππους αὐτῶν,
    καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ ἅρματα αὐτῶν.
37 Μάχαιραν ἐπὶ τοὺς μαχητὰς αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν σύμμικτον
    τὸν ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῆς, καὶ ἔσονται ὡς γυναῖκες· μάχαιραν ἐπὶ τοὺς
    θησαυροὺς αὐτῆς, καὶ διασκορπισθήσονται·
38 μάχαιραν ἐπὶ τὸ ὕδωρ αὐτῆς, ἐπεποίθει, καὶ καταισχυνθήσονται,
    ὅτι γῆ τῶν γλυπτῶν ἐστι, καὶ ἐν ταῖς νήσοις κατεκαυχῶντο.
39 Διὰ τοῦτο κατοικήσουσιν ἰνδάλματα ἐν ταῖς νήσοις, καὶ
    κατοικήσουσιν ἐν αὐτῇ θυγατέρες σειρήνων, οὐ μὴ κατοικηθῇ
    οὐκέτι εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, καὶ οὐ κατοικηθήσεται ἔτι·

**Jeremiah 27**
(Hebrew Chapter 50)

her times are come. Open ye her storehouses, and search her as a cave, and utterly destroy her. Let there be no remnant of her; dry up all her fruits,
**27** and let them go down to slaughter. Woe unto them! For their day is come, and the time of their vengeance.
**28** The voice of those fleeing, and of those saved from the land of Babylon, [shall be heard] to declare in Zion the vengeance from the Lord our God, the vengeance of His temple.
**29** Give ye command unto many against Babylon, to every one that bendeth the bow. Encamp ye against her round about; let none of her be saved. Render unto her according to her works; according to all things whatsoever she hath done, do ye unto her, for she hath resisted the Lord, the Holy God of Israel.
**30** Therefore shall her young men fall in her streets, and all her warriors shall be cast down in that day, saith the Lord.
**31** Behold, I am against thee, O arrogant one, saith the Lord of hosts, for thy day is come, and the time of thy vengeance.
**32** And thy arrogance shall fail, and it shall fall, and there shall be none to raise it up. And I will kindle a fire in her forest, and it shall devour all that are round about her.
**33** Thus saith the Lord of hosts: The sons of Israel are oppressed, and the sons of Judah together. All those who took them captive have oppressed them, for they would not let them go.
**34** But their Redeemer is strong; the Lord Almighty is His name. He shall plead their case against their adversaries, that He may bring forth the land.
**35** A sword upon the Chaldeans, saith the Lord, and upon those who dwell in Babylon, and upon her great men, and upon her wise men!
**36** A sword upon her diviners! A sword upon her warriors, and they shall be paralyzed! A sword upon their horses, and upon their chariots!
**37** A sword upon their warriors, and upon the mixed multitude that is in the midst of her, and they shall become as women! A sword upon her treasures, and they shall be scattered!
**38** A sword upon her water, [for therein] she trusted, and they shall be put to shame. For it is a land of graven images, and in the distant lands they boasted.
**39** Therefore shall specters dwell in the distant lands, and daughters of sirens shall dwell in her. She shall not be inhabited anymore forever, and she shall not be inhabited any longer.
