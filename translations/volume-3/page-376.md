τὴν θάλασσαν τὴν χαλκῆν τὴν ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου συνέτριψαν οἱ
18 Χαλδαῖοι, καὶ ἔλαβον πάντα τὸν χαλκὸν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἀπήνεγκαν εἰς Βαβυλῶνα· καὶ τοὺς ποδιστῆρας, καὶ τοὺς ἀναλημπτῆρας, καὶ τὴν στεφάνην, καὶ τὰς φιάλας, καὶ τὰς χρεάγρας· καὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη τὰ χαλκᾶ, ἐν οἷς ἐλειτούργουν ἐν αὐτοῖς·
19 ἔλαβον· καὶ τὰ θυμιατήρια, καὶ τὰς Ἄπωθό, καὶ τὰς Ματμαρῶθ, καὶ τοὺς ὑποχυτῆρας, καὶ τὰς λυχνίας, καὶ τὰς θυΐσκας, καὶ τοὺς κυάθους, ἃ ἦν χρυσᾶ χρυσᾶ, καὶ ἃ ἦν ἀργυρᾶ ἀργυρᾶ, ἔλαβεν ὁ ἀρχιμάγειρος.
20 Καὶ οἱ στύλοι δύο, καὶ ἡ θάλασσα μία, καὶ οἱ μόσχοι δώδεκα χαλκοῖ ὑποκάτω τῆς θαλάσσης, ἃ ἐποίησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Σαλωμὼν εἰς οἶκον Κυρίου, οὐκ ἦν σταθμὸς τοῦ χαλκοῦ πάντων τῶν σκευῶν τούτων.
21 Καὶ οἱ στύλοι τριακονταπέντε πήχεων ὕψος τοῦ στύλου τοῦ ἑνός, καὶ σπαρτίον δωδεκαπήχεων περιεκύκλου αὐτὸν, καὶ τὸ πάχος αὐτοῦ τεσσάρων δακτύλων κύκλῳ, καὶ γείσους ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῖς χαλκοῦν, καὶ πέντε πήχεων τὸ μῆκος, ὑπεροχὴ τοῦ
22 γείσους τοῦ ἑνός, καὶ δίκτυον καὶ ῥοαὶ ἐπὶ τοῦ γείσους κύκλῳ τὰ πάντα χαλκᾶ, καὶ κατὰ ταῦτα τῷ στύλῳ τῷ δευτέρῳ, ὀκτὼ ῥοαὶ
23 τῷ πήχει τοῖς δώδεκα πήχεσι. Καὶ ἦσαν αἱ ῥοαὶ ἐνενηκονταὲξ τὸ ἓν μέρος, καὶ ἦσαν αἱ πᾶσαι ῥοαὶ ἑκατὸν ἐπὶ τοῦ δικτύου κύκλῳ.
24 Καὶ ἔλαβεν ὁ ἀρχιμάγειρος τὸν Σαραίαν ἱερέα τὸν πρῶτον, καὶ τὸν Σοφονίαν ἱερέα τὸν δευτεροῦντα, καὶ τοὺς τρεῖς τοὺς φυλάσσοντας τὴν ὁδόν.
25 Καὶ ἐκ τῆς πόλεως ἔλαβεν εὐνοῦχον ἕνα, ὃς ἦν ἐπιστάτης τῶν ἀνδρῶν τῶν πολεμιστῶν, καὶ ἑπτὰ ἄνδρας ὀνομαστοὺς, τοὺς ἐν προσώπῳ τοῦ βασιλέως, τοὺς εὑρεθέντας ἐν τῇ πόλει, καὶ τὸν γραμματέα τὸν ἄρχοντα τῶν δυνάμεων, τὸν γραμματεύοντα τῷ λαῷ τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἑξήκοντα ἀνθρώπους ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ
26 τῆς γῆς, τοὺς εὑρεθέντας ἐν μέσῳ τῆς πόλεως. Καὶ ἔλαβεν αὐτοὺς Ναβουζαρδὰν ὁ ἀρχιμάγειρος, καὶ ἤγαγεν αὐτοὺς πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Βαβυλῶνος εἰς Δεδλαθὰ,
27 καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτοὺς βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος καὶ ἐθανάτωσεν αὐτοὺς ἐν Δεδλαθὰ, ἐν γῇ Αἱμάθ· ἀπωκίσθη Ἰούδας ἀπὸ ἐπάνωθεν τῆς γῆς αὐτοῦ.
28 Οὗτος ἔστιν ὁ λαὸς, ὃν μετέθηκε Ναβουχοδονόσορ ἐν ἔτει ἑβδόμῳ Ἰουδαίους τρεῖς χιλιάδας, καὶ εἰκοσιτρεῖς·
29 Ἐν ἔτει ὀγδόῳ καὶ δεκάτῳ Ναβουχοδονόσορ, μετέθηκεν ἀπὸ Ἱερουσαλὴμ ψυχὰς ὀκτακοσίας τριάκοντα δύο.
30 Ἐν ἔτει τρίτῳ καὶ εἰκοστῷ Ναβουχοδονόσορ, μετέθηκεν ὁ ἀρχιμάγειρος Ἰουδαίων ψυχὰς ἑπτακοσίας τεσσαρακονταπέντε·

**JEREMIAH 52**
**17** the Chaldeans did shatter the bronze sea that was in the house of the Lord,
**18** and they took all the bronze thereof, and carried it away unto Babylon. And [they took] the footstools, and the snuff-dishes, and the wreath, and the bowls, and the fleshhooks; yea, all the bronze vessels wherein they did minister with them,
**19** did the chief cook take. And the censers, and the Aphotho, and the Matmaroth, and the libation-bowls, and the lampstands, and the incense-spoons, and the ladles, which were gold, [yea, all] gold, and which were silver, [yea, all] silver, did the chief cook take.
**20** And the two pillars, and the one sea, and the twelve bronze oxen beneath the sea, which King Solomon made for the house of the Lord, there was no reckoning of the weight of the bronze of all these vessels.
**21** And the pillars [were] thirty-and-five cubits the height of the one pillar, and a cord of twelve cubits did encircle it; and its thickness [was] four fingers round about. And a bronze capital [was] upon them, and five cubits [was] the length, [even] the prominence of the
**22** one capital; and a network and pomegranates were upon the capital round about, all of them bronze. And after these things, unto the second pillar, eight pomegranates
**23** did [he measure] by the cubit for the twelve cubits. And the pomegranates were ninety-and-six on the one part, and all the pomegranates were one hundred upon the network round about.
**24** And the chief cook took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three who guarded the way.
**25** And from out of the city he took one eunuch, who was overseer of the men of war; and seven renowned men, those who stood in the king's presence, who were found in the city; and the scribe, the commander of the forces, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people
**26** of the land, who were found in the midst of the city. And Nebuzaradan the chief cook took them, and brought them unto the king of Babylon to Dedlatha,
**27** and the king of Babylon smote them and put them to death in Dedlatha, in the land of Hamath. Judah was carried away captive from off his own land.
**28** This is the people whom Nebuchadnezzar did carry away captive: in the seventh year, three thousand and twenty-three Jews.
**29** In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty-and-two souls.
**30** In the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, the chief cook carried away captive seven hundred forty-and-five Jewish souls.
