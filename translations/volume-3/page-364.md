1 ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο ἡνίκα κατελήφθη Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐν τῷ ἔτει τῷ
ἐννάτῳ τοῦ Σεδεκίου βασιλέως Ἰούδα ἐν τῷ μηνὶ τῷ δεκάτῳ
παρεγένετο Ναβουχοδονόσορ βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος, καὶ πᾶσα ἡ
2 δύναμις αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἐπολιόρκουν αὐτήν. Καὶ ἐν
τῷ ἐνδεκάτῳ ἔτει τοῦ Σεδεκίου, ἐν τῷ μηνὶ τῷ τετάρτῳ, ἐν-
3 νάτῃ τοῦ μηνός, ἐρράγη ἡ πόλις, καὶ εἰσῆλθον πάντες οἱ ἡγε-
μόνες βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος, καὶ ἐκάθισαν ἐν τῇ πύλῃ τῇ μέσῃ
Νηργελσασασὰρ, καὶ Σαμαγὰδ, καὶ Ναβουσάχαρ, καὶ Ναβουσα-
ρεὶς, καὶ Ναγαργὰς, Νασερβαμαχ, καὶ οἱ κατάλοιποι ἡγεμό-
4 νες βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἡνίκα εἶδεν αὐτοὺς Σε-
δεκίας βασιλεὺς Ἰούδα, καὶ πάντες οἱ ἄνδρες πολεμισταὶ, καὶ
ἔφυγον, καὶ ἐξῆλθον νυκτὸς ἐκ τῆς πόλεως κατὰ τὴν ὁδὸν κή-
που τοῦ βασιλέως διὰ τὴν πύλην ἀναμέσον τοῦ τείχους καὶ
5 τοῦ προτειχίσματος· καὶ ἐξῆλθον διὰ τὴν ὁδὸν ἀραβά. Καὶ
κατεδίωξεν ἡ δύναμις τῶν Χαλδαίων ὀπίσω αὐτῶν, καὶ συν-
ἔλαβον τὸν Σεδεκίαν ἐν Ἀραβὼθ Ἰεριχώ, καὶ ἔλαβον αὐτὸν,
καὶ ἤγαγον αὐτὸν πρὸς Ναβουχοδονόσορ βασιλέα Βαβυλῶνος εἰς
Ῥεβλαθὰ τὴν ἐν γῇ Αἱμάθ, καὶ ἐλάλησεν αὐτῷ μετὰ κρίσεως.
6 Καὶ ἔσφαξεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος τοὺς υἱοὺς Σεδεκίου ἐν
Ῥεβλαθᾷ κατ᾽ ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντας τοὺς ἄρχοντας
7 Ἰούδα ἔσφαξε. Καὶ τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς Σεδεκίου ἐξετύφλωσε, καὶ
ἔδησεν αὐτὸν ἐν πέδαις χαλκαῖς, καὶ ἤγαγεν αὐτὸν εἰς Βαβυ-
8 λῶνα. Καὶ τὸν οἶκον τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ τὰς οἰκίας τοῦ λαοῦ
ἐνέπρησαν οἱ Χαλδαῖοι ἐν πυρὶ, καὶ τὸ τεῖχος Ἱερουσαλὴμ
9 καθεῖλαν. Καὶ τὸ περισσὸν τοῦ λαοῦ, καὶ τοὺς ὑπολειφθέντας
ἐν τῇ πόλει, καὶ τοὺς ἐμπεπτωκότας, οἳ ἐνέπεσαν πρὸς τὸν
βασιλέα Βαβυλῶνος, καὶ τὸ λοιπὸν τοῦ λαοῦ, καὶ τοὺς κατα-
λειμμένους ἀπώκισε Ναβουζαρδὰν ὁ ἀρχιμάγειρος εἰς Βαβυλῶ-
10 να. Καὶ ἐκ τῶν πτωχῶν τοῦ λαοῦ, οἷς οὐκ ἦν οὐδὲν, κατέλιπε
Ναβουζαρδὰν ὁ ἀρχιμάγειρος ἐν γῇ Ἰούδα, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐ-
11 τοῖς ἀμπελῶνας, καὶ ἀγροὺς ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ. Καὶ ἐνετείλα-
το Ναβουχοδονόσορ βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος ὑπὲρ τοῦ Ἱερεμίου ἐν

**JEREMIAH 46 (Septuagint) / JEREMIAH 39 (Hebrew)**

**1** And it came to pass, when Jerusalem was taken, in the ninth year of Zedekiah, king of Judah, in the tenth month, that Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came, and all his army against Jerusalem; and they besieged it.
**2** And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, on the ninth [day] of the month, the city was breached, and all the princes of the king of Babylon entered,
**3** and sat in the middle gate, [even] Nergal-Sharezer, and Samagad, and Nabusachar, and Nabusareis, and Nagargas, Naserbamach, and the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon.
**4** And it came to pass, when Zedekiah, king of Judah, and all the men of war, saw them, they fled and went forth by night out of the city by the way of the king's garden, through the gate between the wall and the rampart.
**5** And they went forth by the way of the Arabah. But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them, and they overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and they took him and brought him unto Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, to Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he spoke judgment upon him.
**6** And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his very eyes, and all the princes of Judah he slew.
**7** And the eyes of Zedekiah he put out, and bound him with bronze fetters, and brought him to Babylon.
**8** And the house of the king, and the houses of the people, the Chaldeans burned with fire, and the wall of Jerusalem they tore down.
**9** And the remnant of the people, and those that were left remaining in the city, and the defectors who had fallen away unto the king of Babylon, and the rest of the people, and those that remained, did Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, carry away into exile unto Babylon.
**10** But of the poor of the people, who had nothing, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, left [some] in the land of Judah, and gave unto them vineyards and fields in that day.
**11** And Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, gave charge concerning Jeremiah,
