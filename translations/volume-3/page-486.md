1424 ΔΑΝΙΗΛ ΚΕΦ. Α´.
τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ διδάξαι αὐτοὺς γράμματα καὶ γλῶσσαν Χαλ-
5 δαίων. Καὶ διέταξεν αὐτοῖς ὁ βασιλεὺς τὸ τῆς ἡμέρας καθ’ ἡ-
μέραν, ἀπὸ τῆς τραπέζης τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ οἴνου τοῦ πο-
τοῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ θρέψαι αὐτοὺς ἔτη τρία, καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα στῆναι ἐνώ-
6 πιον τοῦ βασιλέως. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν αὐτοῖς ἐκ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰούδα
7 Δανιήλ, καὶ ᾿Ανανίας, καὶ Μισαήλ, καὶ ᾿Αζαρίας. Καὶ ἐπέθη-
κεν αὐτοῖς ὁ ἀρχιευνοῦχος ὀνόματα, τῷ Δανιὴλ Βαλτάσαρ, καὶ
τῷ ᾿Ανανία Σεδράχ, καὶ τῷ Μισαὴλ Μισάχ, καὶ τῷ ᾿Αζαρία
8 ᾿Αβδεναγώ. Καὶ ἔθετο Δανιὴλ ἐπὶ τὴν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ, ὡς οὐ μὴ
ἁλισγηθῇ ἐν τῇ τραπέζῃ τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ ἐν τῷ οἴνῳ τοῦ πο-
τοῦ αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἠξίωσε τὸν ἀρχιευνοῦχον, ὡς οὐ μὴ ἁλισγηθῇ.
9 Καὶ ἔδωκεν ὁ Θεὸς τὸν Δανιὴλ εἰς ἔλεον καὶ εἰς οἰκτιρμὸν ἐνώπιον
10 τοῦ ἀρχιευνοῦχου. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ ἀρχιευνοῦχος τῷ Δανιήλ· φοβοῦ-
μαι ἐγὼ τὸν Κύριόν μου τὸν βασιλέα, τὸν ἐκτάξαντα τὴν βρῶ-
σιν ὑμῶν, καὶ τὴν πόσιν ὑμῶν, μή ποτε ἴδῃ τὰ πρόσωπα ὑμῶν
σκυθρωπὰ παρὰ τὰ παιδάρια τὰ συνήλικα ὑμῶν, καὶ καταδικά-
11 σητε τὴν κεφαλήν μου τῷ βασιλεῖ. Καὶ εἶπε Δανιὴλ πρὸς ᾿Αμελ-
σάρ, ὃν κατέστησεν ὁ ἀρχιευνοῦχος ἐπὶ Δανιήλ, καὶ ᾿Ανανίαν,
12 καὶ Μισαήλ, καὶ ᾿Αζαρίαν. Πείρασον δὴ τοὺς παῖδάς σου ἡμέρας
δέκα, καὶ δότωσαν ἡμῖν ἀπὸ τῶν σπερμάτων τῆς γῆς, καὶ φαγόμεθα,
13 καὶ ὕδωρ πιόμεθα, καὶ ὀφθήτωσαν ἐνώπιόν σου αἱ ἰδέαι ἡμῶν, καὶ αἱ
ἰδέαι τῶν παιδαρίων τῶν ἐσθιόντων τὴν τράπεζαν τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ
14 καθὼς ἐὰν ἴδῃς, ποίησον μετὰ τῶν παιδαρίων σου. Καὶ εἰσήκου-
15 σεν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπείρασεν αὐτοὺς ἡμέρας δέκα. Καὶ μετὰ τὸ τέλος
τῶν δέκα ἡμερῶν, ὡράθησαν αἱ ἰδέαι αὐτῶν ἀγαθαὶ καὶ ἰσχυραὶ
ταῖς σαρξὶν ὑπὲρ τὰ παιδάρια τὰ ἐσθίοντα τὴν τράπεζαν τοῦ βα-
16 σιλέως. Καὶ ἐγένετο ᾿Αμερσὰρ ἀναιρούμενος τὸ δεῖπνον αὐτῶν,
17 καὶ τὸν οἶνον τοῦ πόματος αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔδιδου αὐτοῖς σπέρματα. Καὶ
τοῖς τέσσαρσιν παιδαρίοις τούτοις (καὶ) ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς ὁ Θεὸς
σύνεσιν καὶ φρόνησιν ἐν πάσῃ γραμματικῇ καὶ σοφίᾳ· καὶ Δανιὴλ
18 συνῆκεν ἐν πάσῃ δράσει καὶ ἐνυπνίοις. Καὶ μετὰ τὸ τέλος τῶν
ἡμερῶν, ὧν εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς εἰσαγαγεῖν αὐτούς, καὶ εἰσήγαγεν
19 αὐτοὺς ὁ ἀρχιευνοῦχος ἐναντίον Ναβουχοδονόσορ, καὶ ἐλάλησε
μετ’ αὐτῶν ὁ βασιλεύς· καὶ οὐχ εὑρέθησαν ἐκ πάντων αὐτῶν ὅ-
20 μοιοι Δανιήλ, καὶ ᾿Ανανία, καὶ Μισαήλ, καὶ ᾿Αζαρία· καὶ ἔστη-
σαν ἐνώπιον τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ ἐν παντὶ ῥήματι σοφίας καὶ ἐπι-

...the king, and to teach them the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.
⁵ And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank, and that they should be nourished three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.
⁶ Now among these were, of the children of Judah, Daniel, and Ananias, and Misael, and Azarias.
⁷ And the chief eunuch gave them names: to Daniel he gave the name Baltasar; and to Ananias, Sedrach; and to Misael, Misach; and to Azarias, Abdenago.
⁸ But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king's portion of meat, nor with the wine which he drank; therefore he entreated the chief eunuch that he might not defile himself.
⁹ And God granted Daniel favour and compassion in the sight of the chief eunuch.
¹⁰ And the chief eunuch said unto Daniel, "I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink; for should he see your countenances more dismal than the young men who are your fellows, then shall ye endanger my head before the king."
¹¹ Then said Daniel to Amelsar, whom the chief eunuch had set over Daniel, and Ananias, and Misael, and Azarias,
¹² "Prove thy servants, I pray thee, for ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.
¹³ Then let our countenances be observed before thee, and the countenances of the young men who eat the king's portion of meat; and according as thou shalt see, deal with thy servants."
¹⁴ So he hearkened unto them in this matter, and proved them ten days.
¹⁵ And at the end of ten days, their countenances appeared fairer and more robust in flesh than all the young men who did eat the king's portion of meat.
¹⁶ Thus Amelsar did take away their portion of meat, and the wine of their drink, and gave them pulse.
¹⁷ And as for these four young men, [even] God gave unto them understanding and prudence in all learning and wisdom; and Daniel did understand in all visions and dreams.
¹⁸ Now at the end of the days, when the king had commanded that they should be brought in, then the chief eunuch brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.
¹⁹ And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, and Ananias, and Misael, and Azarias.
²⁰ Therefore stood they before the king, and in every matter of wisdom and understanding...
