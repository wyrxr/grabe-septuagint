**3** ριε, γινώσκεις με, εἶδές με, καὶ ἐδοκίμασας τὴν καρδίαν μου ἐναντίον σου· ἄθροισον αὐτοὺς ὡς πρόβατα εἰς σφαγήν, καὶ ἁγνισον αὐτοὺς εἰς ἡμέραν σφαγῆς αὐτῶν.
**4** Ἔως πότε πενθήσει ἡ γῆ, καὶ πᾶς χόρτος τοῦ ἀγροῦ ξηρανθήσεται ἀπὸ κακίας τῶν κατοικούντων ἐν αὐτῇ; ἠφανίσθησαν κτήνη καὶ πετεινά, ὅτι εἶπαν, οὐκ ὄψεται ὁ Θεὸς ὁδοὺς ἡμῶν.
**5** Σοῦ οἱ πόδες τρέχουσι, καὶ ἐκλύουσι σε· πῶς παρασκευάσῃ ἐφ᾿ ἵπποις, καὶ ἐν γῇ εἰρήνης σου πέποιθας; πῶς ποιήσεις ἐν φρυάγματι τοῦ Ἰορδάνου;
**6** Ὅτι καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοί σου καὶ ὁ οἶκος τοῦ πατρός σου, καὶ οὗτοι ἠθέτησάν σε, καὶ αὐτοὶ ἐβόησαν, ἐκ τῶν ὀπίσω σου ἐπισυνήχθησαν, μὴ πιστεύσῃς ἐν αὐτοῖς, ὅτι λαλήσουσι πρὸς σὲ καλά.
**7** Ἐγκαταλέλοιπα τὸν οἶκόν μου, ἀφῆκα τὴν κληρονομίαν μου, ἔδωκα τὴν ἠγαπημένην ψυχήν μου εἰς χεῖρας ἐχθρῶν αὐτῆς.
**8** Ἐγενήθη ἡ κληρονομία μου ἐμοὶ ὡς λέων ἐν δρυμῷ, ἔδωκεν ἐπ᾿ ἐμὲ τὴν φωνὴν αὐτῆς, διὰ τοῦτο ἐμίσησα αὐτήν.
**9** Μὴ σπήλαιον ὑαίνης ἡ κληρονομία μου ἐμοί, ἢ σπήλαιον κύκλω αὐτῆς; βαδίσατε καὶ συναγάγετε πάντα τὰ θηρία τοῦ ἀγροῦ, καὶ ἐλθάτωσαν τοῦ καταφαγεῖν αὐτήν.
**10** Ποιμένες πολλοὶ διέφθειραν τὸν ἀμπελῶνά μου, ἐμόλυναν τὴν μερίδα μου, ἔδωκαν τὴν μερίδα μου ἐπιθυμητὴν εἰς ἔρημον ἀδατον, ἐτέθη εἰς ἀφανισμὸν ἀπωλείας·
**11** δι᾿ ἐμὲ ἀφανισμῷ ἠφανίσθη πᾶσα ἡ γῆ, ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν ἀνὴρ τιθέμενος ἐν καρδίᾳ.
**12** Ἐπὶ πᾶσαν διεκβολὴν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ ἦλθοσαν ταλαιπωροῦντες, ὅτι μάχαιρα τοῦ Κυρίου κατέφαγεν ἀπ᾿ ἄκρου τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἕως ἄκρου τῆς γῆς οὐκ ἔστιν εἰρήνη πάσῃ σαρκί.
**13** Ἐσπείρατε πυρούς, καὶ ἀκάνθας θερίσατε· οἱ κλῆροι αὐτῶν οὐκ ὠφελήσυν ἐκυοῦς· αἰσχύνθητε αἰσχύνην ἀπὸ καυχήσεως ὑμῶν, ἀπὸ ὀνειδισμοῦ ἔναντι Κυρίου,
**14** ὅτι τάδε λέγει Κύριος περὶ πάντων τῶν γειτόνων τῶν σκληρῶν, τῶν ἁπτομένων τῆς κληρονομίας μου, ἧς ἐμέρισα τῷ λαῷ μου Ἰσραήλ· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἀποσπῶ αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς αὐτῶν, καὶ τὸν Ἰούδαν ἐκβαλῶ ἐκ μέσου αὐτῶν.
**15** Καὶ ἔσται μετὰ τὸ ἐκβαλεῖν με αὐτούς, ἐπιστρέψω καὶ ἐλεήσω αὐτούς, καὶ κατοικιῶ αὐτούς, ἕκαστον εἰς τὴν κληρονομίαν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἕκαστον εἰς τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ.
**16** Καὶ ἔσται ἐὰν μανθάνοντες μάθωσι τὴν ὁδὸν τοῦ λαοῦ μου, τοῦ ὀμνύειν τῷ ὀνόματί μου· Ζῇ Κύριος, καθὼς ἐδίδαξαν τὸν λαόν μου ὀμνύειν τῇ Βάαλ, καὶ οἰκοδομηθήσονται ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ λαοῦ μου·
**17** ἐὰν δὲ μὴ ἐπιστρέψωσι, καὶ ἐξαρῶ τὸ ἔθνος ἐκεῖνα ἐξάρσει καὶ ἀπωλείᾳ.

**3** —O Lord, Thou knowest me; Thou hast seen me, and hast proven my heart before Thee. Gather them as sheep for the slaughter, and set them apart for the day of their slaughter.
**4** How long shall the earth mourn, and every herb of the field wither away, because of the wickedness of them that dwell therein? Both beast and bird are consumed, for they have said, "God shall not behold our ways."
**5** If thy feet run and they weary thee, how then wilt thou prepare thyself against horses? And if thou hast trusted in thy land of peace, how then wilt thou fare in the swelling of the Jordan?
**6** For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; yea, they have cried out, and gathered themselves together behind thee. Trust not in them, though they speak fair words unto thee.
**7** I have forsaken My house, I have abandoned My inheritance; I have given the beloved soul of Mine into the hands of her enemies.
**8** My inheritance is become unto Me as a lion in the thicket; it hath lifted up its voice against Me, therefore have I hated it.
**9** Is My inheritance unto Me a den of hyenas, or a cave round about it? Go ye and gather all the beasts of the field, and let them come to devour it.
**10** Many shepherds have laid waste My vineyard; they have defiled My portion. They have made My desirable portion into a wilderness untrodden; it hath been made a desolate waste of ruin.
**11** For My sake, the whole land hath been made desolate with utter desolation, because there is no man who layeth [it] to heart.
**12** Upon every crossroads in the wilderness have they come, suffering; for the sword of the Lord hath devoured from one end of the land even to the other end of the land, and there is no peace for any flesh.
**13** Ye have sown wheat, yet have reaped thorns; their portions did not profit, nor did they bring forth. Be ye ashamed with shame from your boasting, from the reproach before the Lord.
**14** For thus saith the Lord concerning all the hard neighbors who touch My inheritance, which I have divided unto My people Israel: "Behold, I will pluck them up from their own land, and I will cast out Judah from among them."
**15** And it shall come to pass, after that I have cast them out, I will turn again and have mercy upon them; and I will cause them to dwell, each man in his inheritance, and each man in his own land.
**16** And it shall come to pass, if they will learn diligently the way of My people, to swear by My Name, saying, "As the Lord liveth," even as they taught My people to swear by Baal, then shall they be built in the midst of My people.
**17** But if they will not turn, then I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation with complete destruction.
