ρανός· ὁ ἥλιος καὶ ἡ σελήνη συσκοτάσουσι, καὶ τὰ ἄστρα δύσουσι
τὸ φέγγος αὐτῶν. Καὶ Κύριος δώσει φωνὴν αὐτοῦ πρὸ προσώπου 11
δυνάμεως αὐτοῦ, ὅτι πολλὴ ἐστι σφόδρα ἡ παρεμβολὴ αὐτοῦ, ὅτι
ἰσχυρὰ ἔργα λόγων αὐτοῦ· διότι μεγάλη ἡμέρα τοῦ Κυρίου, καὶ
ἐπιφανὴς σφόδρα, καὶ τίς ἱκανὸς ἔσται αὐτῇ; Καὶ νῦν λέγει Κύριος 12
ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν, ἐπιστράφητε πρὸς μὲ ἐξ ὅλης τῆς καρδίας ὑμῶν,
καὶ ἐν νηστείᾳ, καὶ ἐν κλαυθμῷ, καὶ ἐν κοπετῷ, καὶ διαρ- 13
ῥήξατε τὰς καρδίας ὑμῶν, καὶ μὴ τὰ ἱμάτια ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐπιστράφητε
πρὸς Κύριον τὸν Θεὸν ὑμῶν· ὅτι ἐλεήμων καὶ οἰκτίρμων ἐστί,
μακρόθυμος καὶ πολυέλεος, καὶ μετανοῶν ἐπὶ ταῖς κακίαις. Τίς οἶδεν 14
εἰ ἐπιστρέψει, καὶ μετανοήσει, καὶ ὑπολείψεται ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ
εὐλογίαν, θυσίαν καὶ σπονδὴν Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ ὑμῶν; Σαλπίσατε 15
σάλπιγγι ἐν Σιών, ἁγιάσατε νηστείαν, κηρύξατε θεραπείαν,
συναγάγετε τὸν λαὸν, ἁγιάσατε ἐκκλησίαν, ἐκλέξασθε πρεσβυτέρους, 16
συναγάγετε νήπια θηλάζοντα μαστούς· ἐξελθάτω νυμφίος ἐκ τοῦ
κοιτῶνος αὐτοῦ, καὶ νύμφη ἐκ τοῦ παστοῦ αὐτῆς. Ἀναμέσον τῆς 17
κρηπῖδος τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου κλαύσονται οἱ ἱερεῖς οἱ λειτουργοῦντες
Κυρίῳ, καὶ ἐροῦσι, φεῖσαι Κύριε τοῦ λαοῦ σου, καὶ μὴ δῶς τὴν
κληρονομίαν σου εἰς ὄνειδος, τοῦ κατάρξαι αὐτῶν ἔθνη, ὅπως μὴ
εἴπωσιν ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι· ποῦ ἐστι Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς αὐτῶν; Καὶ ἐζήλωσε 18
Κύριος τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐφείσατο τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη 19
Κύριος, καὶ εἶπε τῷ λαῷ αὐτοῦ· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐξαποστέλλω ὑμῖν τὸν
σῖτον καὶ τὸν οἶνον καὶ τὸ ἔλαιον, καὶ ἐμπλησθήσεσθε αὐτῶν, καὶ
οὐ δώσω ὑμᾶς οὐκ ἔτι εἰς ὀνειδισμὸν ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι· καὶ τὸν ἀπὸ 20
βορρᾶ ἐκδιώξω ἀφ’ ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐξώσω αὐτὸν εἰς γῆν ἄνυδρον, καὶ
ἀφανιῶ τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν τὴν πρώτην, καὶ τὰ
ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν τὴν ἐσχάτην· καὶ ἀναβήσεται ἡ
σαπρία αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀναβήσεται ὁ βρόμος αὐτοῦ, ὅτι ἐμεγάλυνε τὰ
ἔργα αὐτοῦ. Θάρσει γῆ, χαῖρε καὶ εὐφραίνου, ὅτι ἐμεγάλυνε 21
Κύριος τοῦ ποιῆσαι. Θαρσεῖτε κτήνη τοῦ πεδίου, ὅτι βεβλάστησε 22
τὰ πεδία τῆς ἐρήμου, ὅτι ξύλον ἤνεγκε τὸν καρπὸν αὐτοῦ, συκῆ καὶ
ἄμπελος ἔδωκαν τὴν ἰσχὺν αὐτῶν. Καὶ τὰ τέκνα Σιὼν χαίρετε καὶ 23
εὐφραίνεσθε ἐπὶ τῷ Κυρίῳ Θεῷ ὑμῶν, διότι ἔδωκεν ὑμῖν τὰ
βρώματα εἰς δικαιοσύνην, καὶ βρέξει ὑμῖν ὑετὸν πρώιμον καὶ
ὄψιμον, καθὼς ἔμπροσθεν· καὶ ἐμπλησθήσονται αἱ ἅλωνες σίτου, 24

#### Chapter 2

**10** the heaven; the sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their shining.
**11** And the Lord shall utter His voice before the face of His army; for His host is exceedingly great, and mighty are the works of His words. For great is the day of the Lord, and most terrible; and who shall be able to endure it?
**12** And now, saith the Lord your God, Turn ye unto Me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with lamentation.
**13** And rend your hearts, and not your garments; and turn ye unto the Lord your God: for He is merciful and compassionate, long-suffering and plenteous in mercy, and repenteth Him of the evil [decreed].
**14** Who knoweth if He will turn and repent, and leave behind Him a blessing, [even] a grain offering and a drink offering unto the Lord your God?
**15** Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, proclaim a sacred assembly.
**16** Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the babes that suck the breasts. Let the bridegroom go forth from his chamber, and the bride from her bridal chamber.
**17** Between the porch and the altar shall the priests weep, who minister unto the Lord, and they shall say, Spare, O Lord, Thy people, and give not Thine inheritance to reproach, that nations should rule over them, lest they should say among the nations, Where is the Lord their God?
**18** Then the Lord was zealous for His land, and spared His people.
**19** And the Lord answered and said unto His people, Behold, I will send you the grain and the wine and the oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith; and I will no longer give you over to reproach among the nations.
**20** And the [enemy] from the north will I drive far from you, and I will cast him forth into a dry land; and I will destroy his vanguard towards the eastern sea, and his rearguard towards the western sea. And his rottenness shall ascend, and his stench shall ascend, because he hath done great things.
**21** Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice, for the Lord hath done great things.
**22** Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field; for the pastures of the wilderness have sprung forth, for the tree hath brought forth its fruit, the fig tree and the vine have yielded their strength.
**23** And ye children of Zion, be glad and rejoice in the Lord your God; for He hath given you the provisions unto righteousness, and He shall cause to rain upon you the early rain and the latter rain, as before.
**24** And the threshing floors shall be full of grain, and the winepresses shall overflow with wine and oil.
