12 Καὶ αὕτη ἔσται ἡ πτῶσις, ἣν κόψει Κύριος πάντας τοὺς λαούς,
   ὅσοι ἐπεστράτευσαν ἐπὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ· τακήσονται αἱ σάρκες αὐτῶν,
   ἑστηκότων αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τοὺς πόδας αὐτῶν, καὶ οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτῶν
   τηκήσονται ἀπὸ τῶν ὀπῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἡ γλῶσσα αὐτῶν τακήσε-
   ται ἐν τῷ στόματι αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἔκστα-
   σις Κυρίου ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς μεγάλη· καὶ ἐπιλήψονται ἕκαστος τῆς χει-
   ρὸς τοῦ πλησίον αὐτοῦ, καὶ συμπλακήσεται ἡ χεὶρ αὐτοῦ πρὸς
14 χεῖρα τοῦ πλησίον αὐτοῦ. Καὶ δὲ Ἰούδας παρατάξεται ἐν Ἱερου-
   σαλήμ, καὶ συνάξει τὴν ἰσχὺν πάντων τῶν λαῶν κυκλόθεν, χρυ-
15 σίον καὶ ἀργύριον καὶ ἱματισμὸν εἰς πλῆθος σφόδρα. Καὶ αὕτη
   ἔσται ἡ πτῶσις τῶν ἵππων, καὶ τῶν ἡμιόνων, καὶ τῶν καμήλων,
   καὶ τῶν ὄνων, καὶ πάντων τῶν κτηνῶν τῶν ὄντων ἐν ταῖς πα-
16 ρεμβολαῖς ἐκείναις, κατὰ τὴν πτῶσιν ταύτην. Καὶ ἔσται, ὅσοι
   ἂν καταλειφθῶσιν ἐκ πάντων τῶν ἐθνῶν τῶν ἐλθόντων ἐπὶ Ἱερου-
   σαλήμ, καὶ ἀναβήσονται κατ’ ἐνιαυτόν, τοῦ προσκυνῆσαι τῷ βα-
   σιλεῖ Κυρίῳ παντοκράτορι, καὶ τοῦ ἑορτάζειν τὴν ἑορτὴν τῆς
17 σκηνοπηγίας. Καὶ ἔσται, ὅσοι ἐὰν μὴ ἀναβῶσιν ἐκεῖ ἐκ πασῶν
   τῶν φυλῶν τῆς γῆς εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ, τοῦ προσκυνῆσαι τῷ βασι-
   λεῖ Κυρίῳ παντοκράτορι, καὶ οὗτοι ἐκείνοις προστεθήσονται.
18 Ἐὰν δὲ φυλὴ Αἰγύπτου μὴ ἀναβῇ, μηδὲ ἔλθῃ ἐκεῖ, καὶ ἐπὶ τού-
19 τους ἔσται ἡ πτῶσις, ἣν πατάξει Κύριος πάντα τὰ ἔθνη, ὅσα ἐὰν
   μὴ ἀναβῇ, τοῦ ἑορτάσαι τὴν ἑορτὴν τῆς σκηνοπηγίας. Αὕτη ἔσται
   ἡ ἁμαρτία Αἰγύπτου, καὶ ἡ ἁμαρτία πάντων τῶν ἐθνῶν, ὅσα
20 ἐὰν μὴ ἀναβῇ τοῦ ἑορτάσαι τὴν ἑορτὴν τῆς σκηνοπηγίας. Ἐν
   τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἔσται τὸ ἐπὶ τὸν χαλινὸν τοῦ ἵππου ἅγιον τῷ
   Κυρίῳ παντοκράτορι· καὶ ἔσονται οἱ λέβητες οἱ ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ Κυ-
21 ρίου ὡς φιάλαι πρὸ προσώπου τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου· καὶ ἔσται πᾶς
   λέβης ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ καὶ ἐν τῷ Ἰούδα ἅγιον τῷ Κυρίῳ παντο-
   κράτορι· καὶ ἥξουσι πάντες οἱ θυσιάζοντες, καὶ λήψονται ἐξ αὐ-
   τῶν, καὶ ἐψήσουσιν ἐν αὐτοῖς, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται Χαναναῖος οὐκέτι
   ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ Κυρίου παντοκράτορος ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ.

**Zechariah [Chapter] 14**

**12** And this shall be the plague wherewith the LORD shall smite all the peoples that have arrayed themselves against Jerusalem: their flesh shall melt away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall melt away in their sockets, and their tongue shall melt away in their mouth.

**13** And it shall come to pass in that day, a great panic from the LORD shall be upon them; and each one shall seize the hand of his neighbour, and his hand shall turn against the hand of his neighbour.

**14** And Judah also shall fight in Jerusalem; and he shall gather the wealth of all the nations round about, gold and silver and raiment, in exceeding great abundance.

**15** And this shall be the plague of the horses, of the mules, of the camels, and of the asses, and of all the beasts that shall be in those camps, even according to this plague.

**16** And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD Almighty, and to keep the Feast of Tabernacles.

**17** And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not go up from all the families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD Almighty, even these shall be added unto them.

**18** And if the family of Egypt shall not go up, nor come, then upon these also shall be the plague, wherewith the LORD shall smite all the nations that go not up to keep the Feast of Tabernacles.

**19** This shall be the sin of Egypt, and the sin of all the nations that shall not go up to keep the Feast of Tabernacles.

**20** In that day, that which is upon the bridle of the horse shall be holy unto the LORD Almighty; and the cauldrons in the house of the LORD shall be as the bowls before the face of the altar.

**21** And every cauldron in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holy unto the LORD Almighty; and all they that sacrifice shall come, and shall take of them, and shall boil therein; and there shall be no more a Canaanite in the house of the LORD Almighty in that day.
