**ΨΑΛΤΗΡΙΟΝ.**

**ΨΑΛΜ. ΝΗ΄. LVIII.**

1 Εἰς τὸ τέλος, μὴ διαφθείρῃς, τῷ Δαυὶδ εἰς στηλογραφίαν, ὁπότε ἀπέστειλε Σαούλ, καὶ ἐφύλαξε τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ, τοῦ θανατῶσαι αὐτόν.
2 Ἐξελοῦ με ἐκ τῶν ἐχθρῶν μου ὁ Θεός, καὶ ἐκ τῶν ἐπανισταμένων ἐπ᾽ ἐμὲ λύτρωσαί με·
3 ῥῦσαί με ἐκ τῶν ἐργαζομένων τὴν ἀνομίαν, καὶ ἐξ ἀνδρῶν αἱμάτων σῶσόν με.
4 Ὅτι ἰδοὺ ἐθήρευσαν τὴν ψυχήν μου, ἐπέθεντο ἐπ᾽ ἐμὲ κραταιοί· οὔτε ἡ ἀνομία μου, οὔτε ἡ ἁμαρτία μου, Κύριε.
5 Ἄνευ ἀνομίας ἔδραμον καὶ κατεύθυναν· ἐξεγέρθητι εἰς συνάντησίν μου, καὶ ἴδε.
6 Καὶ σὺ Κύριε ὁ Θεὸς τῶν δυνάμεων, ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, πρόσχες τοῦ ἐπισκέψασθαι πάντα τὰ ἔθνη· μὴ οἰκτειρήσῃς πάντας τοὺς ἐργαζομένους τὴν ἀνομίαν. Διάψαλμα.
7 Ἐπιστρέψουσιν εἰς ἑσπέραν, καὶ λιμώξουσιν ὡς κύων, καὶ κυκλώσουσι πόλιν.
8 Ἰδοὺ ἀποφθέγξονται ἐν τῷ στόματι αὐτῶν, καὶ ῥομφαία ἐν τοῖς χείλεσιν αὐτῶν· ὅτι τίς ἤκουσε;
9 Καὶ σὺ Κύριε ἐκγελάσῃ αὐτοὺς, ἐξουδενώσεις πάντα τὰ ἔθνη.
10 Τὸ κράτος μου πρὸς σὲ φυλάξω· ὅτι σὺ ὁ Θεὸς ἀντιλήπτωρ μου εἶ.
11 Ὁ Θεός μου τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ προφθάσει με· ὁ Θεός μου δείξει μοι ἐν τοῖς ἐχθροῖς μου.
12 Μὴ ἀποκτείνῃς αὐτοὺς, μήποτε ἐπιλάθωνται τοῦ λαοῦ μου. Διακόρπισον αὐτοὺς ἐν τῇ δυνάμει σου, καὶ κατάγαγε αὐτοὺς, ὁ ὑπερασπιστής μου Κύριε,
13 ἁμαρτίαν στόματος αὐτῶν, λόγον χειλέων αὐτῶν· καὶ συλληφθήτωσαν ἐν τῇ ὑπερηφανίᾳ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐξ ἀρᾶς καὶ ψεύδους διαγγελθήσονται ἐν συντελείᾳ, ἐν ὀργῇ συντελείας, καὶ οὐ μὴ ὑπάρξουσι·
14 καὶ γνώσονται ὅτι ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ Ἰακὼβ δεσπόζει τῶν περάτων τῆς γῆς. Διάψαλμα.
15 Ἐπιστρέψουσιν εἰς ἑσπέραν, καὶ λιμώξουσιν ὡς κύων, καὶ κυκλώσουσι πόλιν·
16 αὐτοὶ διασκορπισθήσονται τοῦ φαγεῖν ἐὰν δὲ μὴ χορτασθῶσι, καὶ γογγύσουσιν.
17 Ἐγὼ δὲ ἄσομαι τὴν δύναμίν σου, καὶ ἀγαλλιάσομαι τοπρωΐ τὸ ἔλεός σου· ὅτι ἐγενήθης ἀντιλήπτωρ μου, καὶ καταφυγή μου ἐν ἡμέρᾳ θλίψεώς μου.
18 Βοηθός μου σοι ψαλῶ· ὅτι ὁ Θεός (μου) ἀντιλήπτωρ μου εἶ, ὁ Θεός μου τὸ ἔλεός μου.

**PSALM LVIII.**

1 Unto the End, Destroy Not; A Michtam of David. When Saul sent [men], and they watched his house, to slay him.

2 Deliver me from mine enemies, O God;
and from them that rise up against me, do Thou redeem me.
3 Rescue me from them that work unrighteousness,
and from men of blood do Thou save me.
4 For behold, they have hunted my soul;
the mighty have set themselves against me.
Not for mine iniquity, nor for my sin, O Lord.
5 Without unrighteousness have they run and made ready [their attack];
awake Thou to meet me, and behold.
6 And Thou, O Lord God of hosts,
the God of Israel,
give heed to visit all the nations;
have no mercy upon all them that work unrighteousness. Selah.
7 They shall return at eventide,
and shall hunger as a dog,
and shall encompass the city.
8 Behold, they shall utter [words] with their mouth,
and a sword [is] in their lips;
for [they say], "Who hath heard?"
9 But Thou, O Lord, shalt laugh them to scorn;
Thou shalt bring to naught all the nations.
10 My strength, unto Thee will I watch;
for Thou, O God, art my helper.
11 My God, His mercy shall go before me;
my God shall show me [His power] over my enemies.
12 Slay them not, lest my people forget [Thy works].
Scatter them by Thy might, and bring them down,
O Lord, my Defender.
13 For the sin of their mouth and the word of their lips,
let them even be caught in their pride;
and for cursing and for falsehood,
let them be proclaimed in their utter destruction,
yea, in the wrath of their utter destruction,
and they shall be no more.
14 And they shall know that the God of Jacob
doth reign unto the ends of the earth. Selah.
15 They shall return at eventide,
and shall hunger as a dog,
and shall encompass the city.
16 They themselves shall be scattered to seek [their] food;
but if they be not filled, then shall they murmur.
17 But I will sing of Thy power;
and I will rejoice in the morning in Thy mercy;
for Thou hast been my helper,
and my refuge in the day of my tribulation.
18 My Helper, unto Thee will I sing praises;
for God (my God) is my helper,
my God [is] my mercy.
