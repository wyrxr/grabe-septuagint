**ΚΕΦ. Δ´. IV.**

1.  ἈΚΟΥΣΑΤΕ λόγον Κυρίου υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ, διότι κρίσις τῷ Κυρίῳ πρὸς τοὺς κατοικοῦντας τὴν γῆν· διότι οὐκ ἔστιν ἀλήθεια,
2.  οὐδὲ ἔλεος, οὐδὲ ἐπίγνωσις Θεοῦ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς· ἀρά, καὶ ψεῦδος,
3.  καὶ φόνος, καὶ κλοπή, καὶ μοιχεία κέχυται ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, καὶ αἵματα ἐφ᾽ αἵμασι μίσγουσι. Διὰ τοῦτο πενθήσει ἡ γῆ, καὶ σμικρυνθήσεται σὺν πᾶσι τοῖς κατοικοῦσιν αὐτήν, σὺν τοῖς θηρίοις τοῦ ἀγροῦ, καὶ σὺν τοῖς ἑρπετοῖς τῆς γῆς, καὶ σὺν τοῖς πετεινοῖς τοῦ
4.  οὐρανοῦ, καὶ οἱ ἰχθύες τῆς θαλάσσης ἐκλείψουσιν· ὅπως μηδεὶς μήτε δικάζηται, μήτε ἐλέγχῃ μηδείς.
5.  Ὁ δὲ λαός μου ὡς ἀντιλεγόμενος ἱερεύς, καὶ ἀσθενήσει ἡμέρας· καὶ ἀσθενήσει καὶ προφήτης μετὰ σοῦ. Νυκτὶ ὡμοίωσα τὴν μητέρα σου· (νυκτὶ) ὡμοιώθη ὁ λαός μου ὡς οὐκ ἔχων γνῶσιν·
6.  ὅτι σὺ ἐπίγνωσιν ἀπώσω, καὶ ἐγὼ ἀπώσομαί σε, τοῦ μὴ ἱερατεύειν μοι· καὶ ἐπελάθου νόμου Θεοῦ σου, κἀγὼ ἐπιλήσομαι τέκνων σου.
7.  Κατὰ τὸ πλῆθος αὐτῶν, οὕτως ἥμαρτόν μοι· τὴν δόξαν αὐτῶν εἰς ἀτιμίαν θήσω.
8.  Ἁμαρτίας λαοῦ μου φάγονται, καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἀδικίαις αὐτῶν λήψονται τὰς ψυχὰς αὐτῶν,
9.  καὶ ἔσται καθὼς ὁ λαός, οὕτως καὶ ὁ ἱερεύς· καὶ ἐκδικήσω ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸν τὰς ὁδοὺς αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰ διαβούλια αὐτοῦ ἀνταποδώσω αὐτῷ.
10. Καὶ φάγονται, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἐμπλησθῶσιν· ἐπόρνευσαν, καὶ οὐ μὴ κατευθύνωσι, διότι τὸν Κύριον ἐγκατέλειπον τοῦ φυλάξαι.
11. Πορνείαν καὶ οἶνον καὶ μέθυσμα ἐδέξατο καρδία λαοῦ μου.
12. Ἐν συμβουλαῖς ἐπηρώτων, καὶ ἐν ῥάβδοις αὐτοῦ ἀπήγγελλον αὐτῷ· ὅτι πνεύματι πορνείας ἐπλανήθησαν, καὶ ἐξεπόρνευσαν ἀπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ αὐτῶν·
13. ἐπὶ τὰς κορυφὰς τῶν ὀρέων ἐθυσίαζον, καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς βουνοὺς ἔθυον ὑποκάτω δρυός, καὶ λεύκης, καὶ δένδρου συσκιάζοντος, ὅτι καλὸν σκέπη. Διὰ τοῦτο ἐκπορνεύ-
14. σουσιν αἱ θυγατέρες ὑμῶν, καὶ αἱ νύμφαι ὑμῶν μοιχεύσουσι· καὶ οὐ μὴ ἐπισκέψωμαι ἐπὶ τὰς θυγατέρας ὑμῶν, ὅταν πορνεύσωσι, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς νύμφας ὑμῶν, ὅταν μοιχεύσωσι· διότι καὶ αὐτοὶ μετὰ τῶν πορνῶν συνφύροντο, καὶ μετὰ τῶν τετελεσμένων ἔθυον·
15. καὶ ὁ λαὸς οὐ συνιῶν συνεπλέκετο μετὰ πόρνης. Σὺ δὲ Ἰσραήλ μὴ ἀγνόει, καὶ Ἰούδα· μὴ εἰσπορεύεσθε εἰς Γάλγαλα, καὶ μὴ ἀναβαίνετε εἰς τὸν οἶκον Ὢν, καὶ μὴ ὀμνύετε ζῶντα Κύριον.

**HOSEA**
**CHAPTER 4**

**1** Hear the word of the Lord, ye children of Israel; for the Lord hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth,
**2** nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land. Cursing and lying,
**3** and murder, and theft, and adultery have been poured out upon the land, and blood toucheth blood. Therefore shall the land mourn, and all that dwell therein shall be diminished, with the beasts of the field, and with the creeping things of the earth, and with the fowls of the heaven,
**4** and the fishes of the sea shall fail; so that no man contendeth, neither reproveth any man.
**5** But My people are like unto a gainsaying priest, and shall faint in the day; and a prophet also shall faint with thee. I have likened thy mother unto the night; (unto the night) is My people likened, as having no knowledge.
**6** Because thou hast rejected knowledge, I also will reject thee, that thou shalt not minister as priest unto Me; and thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I also will forget thy children.
**7** According to the multitude of them, so have they sinned against Me; I will change their glory into shame.
**8** They shall eat the sins of My people, and shall lift up their souls unto their iniquities.
**9** And it shall be, as the people is, so shall the priest be; and I will avenge upon him his ways, and his counsels will I repay unto him.
**10** And they shall eat, and shall not be satisfied; they have committed whoredom, and shall not prosper, because they have forsaken the Lord, [and ceased] to keep [His covenant].
**11** Whoredom and wine and strong drink hath taken away the heart of My people.
**12** In their counsels they inquired, and with their staffs they declared unto them; for by a spirit of whoredom have they gone astray, and have played the harlot from their God.
**13** Upon the tops of the mountains they sacrificed, and upon the hills they burned incense under an oak, and a poplar, and a shady tree, because its shade is good. Therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your daughters-in-law shall commit adultery;
**14** and I will not punish your daughters when they commit harlotry, nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery; because even they themselves mingled with harlots, and sacrificed with the consecrated ones.
**15** And the people, not understanding, entangled themselves with a harlot. But thou, O Israel, do not ignorantly err, and thou, O Judah; come not ye into Gilgal, and go not up to the House of On, and swear not, "The Lord liveth."
