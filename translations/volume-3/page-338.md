23 καὶ συνελάβοσαν αὐτόν, καὶ ἐξήγαγον αὐτὸν ἐκεῖθεν, καὶ εἰσή-
    γαγον αὐτὸν πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Ἰωακείμ, καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτὸν
    ἐν μαχαίρᾳ, καὶ ἐξέῤῥιψεν αὐτὸν εἰς τὸ μνῆμα υἱῶν λαοῦ αὐτοῦ.
24 Πλὴν χεὶρ Ἀχεικὰμ υἱοῦ Σαφὰν ἦν μετὰ Ἱερεμίου, τοῦ μὴ
    παραδοῦναι αὐτὸν εἰς χεῖρας τοῦ λαοῦ, τοῦ μὴ ἀνελεῖν αὐτόν.

1  Ἐν ἀρχῇ βασιλείας Ἰωακεὶμ υἱοῦ Ἰωσίου βασιλέως Ἰούδα
2  ἐγένετο λόγος οὗτος πρὸς Ἱερεμίαν παρὰ Κυρίου, λέγων· οὕ-
   τως εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς μέ· ποίησον σεαυτῷ δεσμοὺς καὶ κλοιούς,
3  καὶ περίθου περὶ τὸν τράχηλόν σου, καὶ ἀποστελεῖς αὐτοὺς πρὸς
   τὸν βασιλέα Ἰδουμαίας, καὶ πρὸς βασιλέα Μωάβ, καὶ πρὸς βα-
   σιλέα υἱῶν Ἀμμών, καὶ πρὸς βασιλέα Τύρου, καὶ πρὸς βασι-
   λέα Σιδῶνος, ἐν χερσὶ τῶν ἀγγέλων αὐτῶν τῶν ἐρχομένων εἰς
   ἀπάντησιν αὐτῶν εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ πρὸς Σεδεκίαν βασιλέα Ἰούδα.
4  Καὶ συντάξεις αὐτοῖς πρὸς τοὺς κυρίους αὐτῶν εἰπεῖν, οὕτως
   εἶπε Κύριος τῶν δυνάμεων ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ, οὕτως ἐρεῖτε πρὸς
5  τοὺς κυρίους ὑμῶν, ὅτι ἐγὼ ἐποίησα τὴν γῆν καὶ τοὺς ἀνθρώπους
   καὶ τὰ κτήνη, ὅσα ἐπὶ προσώπου τῆς γῆς, ἐν τῇ ἰσχύϊ μου τῇ με-
   γάλῃ, καὶ ἐν τῷ ἐπιχείρῳ μου τῷ ὑψηλῷ, καὶ δώσω αὐτὴν ᾧ ἐὰν
6  δόξῃ ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς μου. Καὶ νῦν ἐγὼ εἰμι, ἔδωκα τὴν γῆν πᾶ-
   σαν ταύτην ἐν χειρὶ τοῦ Ναβουχοδονόσορ βασιλεῖ Βαβυλῶνος
   δουλεύειν αὐτῷ, καὶ τὰ θηρία τοῦ ἀγροῦ δέδωκα αὐτῷ ἐργάζε-
7  σθαι αὐτῷ· καὶ δουλεύσουσιν αὐτῷ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη, καὶ τῷ υἱῷ
   τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ, ἕως ἔλθῃ ὁ καιρὸς τῆς γῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ δουλεύσει
8  αὐτῷ ἔθνη πολλὰ καὶ βασιλεῖς μεγάλοι· καὶ ἔσται τὸ ἔθνος καὶ
   ἡ βασιλεία, ὅσοι ἂν μὴ δουλώσωσι τῷ Ναβουχοδονόσορι βασιλεῖ
   Βαβυλῶνος, καὶ ὅσοι μὴ ἐμβάλωσι τὸν τράχηλον αὐτῶν ὑπὸ ζυ-
   γὸν βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος, (καὶ δουλεύσουσιν αὐτῷ,) ἐν μαχαίρᾳ
   (πεσοῦνται) καὶ ἐν λιμῷ καὶ ἐν θανάτῳ ἐπισκέψομαι αὐτούς, εἶπε
9  Κύριος, ἕως ἂν ἐκλίπωσιν ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ὑμεῖς μὴ ἀκούετε
   τῶν ψευδοπροφητῶν ὑμῶν, καὶ τῶν μαντευομένων ὑμῖν, καὶ τῶν
   ἐνυπνιαζομένων ὑμῖν, καὶ τῶν οἰωνισμάτων ὑμῶν, καὶ τῶν φαρμα-
   κῶν ὑμῶν, τῶν λεγόντων πρὸς ὑμᾶς, τῷ λέγειν· οὐ μὴ ἐργάσησθε

**23** and they apprehended him, and brought him forth thence, and led him unto Jehoiakim the king; and he smote him with the sword, and cast him forth into the grave of the children of his people.

**24** Howbeit, the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that he should not be delivered into the hand of the people, so that they should not slay him.

**Jeremiah, Chapter 34**

**1** In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah,

**2** this word came unto Jeremiah from the Lord, saying, "Thus saith the Lord unto Me: 'Make thee bonds and yokes,

**3** and put them upon thy neck; and thou shalt send them unto the king of Edom, and unto the king of Moab, and unto the king of the children of Ammon, and unto the king of Tyre, and unto the king of Sidon, by the hand of their messengers, which come unto Jerusalem to Zedekiah the king of Judah for their meeting.

**4** And thou shalt give them a charge to speak unto their masters, saying, 'Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel: Thus shall ye say unto

**5** your masters, "I have made the earth, and the man, and the beast that are upon the face of the earth, by My great strength and by My high arm; and I will give it unto whomsoever it seemeth good in Mine eyes.

**6** And now, I it is that have given all this land into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, to serve him; and the beasts of the field have I given him, to labor for him.

**7** And all the nations shall serve him, and the son of his son, until the appointed season of his land shall come; and then shall many nations and great kings serve him.

**8** And it shall come to pass, that the nation and the kingdom, as many as will not serve Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and as many as will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, (and they shall serve him,) by the sword (shall they fall), and by famine, and by pestilence will I visit them," saith the Lord, "until they be consumed by his hand."

**9** And as for you, hearken ye not unto your false prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreamers of dreams, nor to your observers of omens, nor to your sorcerers, which speak unto you, saying, 'Ye shall not serve
