82  ἐθανάτωσαν ἐν λάκκῳ ζωήν μου, καὶ ἐπέθηκαν λίθον ἐπ᾽ ἐμοί.
83  Ὑπερεχύθη ὕδωρ ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλήν μου· εἶπα, ἀπώσμαι.
                                                      Κώφ.
84  Ἐπεκαλεσάμην τὸ ὄνομά σου, Κύριε, ἐκ λάκκου κατωτάτου,
85  φωνήν μου ἤκουσας· μὴ κρύψῃς τὰ ὦτά σου εἰς τὴν δέησίν μου,
86  εἰς τὴν βοήθειάν μου ἤγγισας, ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ᾗ ἐπεκαλεσάμην σε,
       εἶπας μοι, μὴ φοβοῦ.
                                                      Ῥήχς.
87  Ἐδίκασας, Κύριε, τὰς δίκας τῆς ψυχῆς μου, ἐλυτρώσω τὴν ζωήν
88  μου. Ἴδες, Κύριε, τὰς ταραχάς μου, ἔκρινας τὴν κρίσιν μου.
89  Ἴδες πᾶσαν τὴν ἐκδίκησιν αὐτῶν, καὶ πάντας διαλογισμοὺς αὐ-
       τῶν ἐν ἐμοί.
                                                      Χσέν.
60  Ἤκουσας τὸν ὀνειδισμὸν αὐτῶν, πάντας τοὺς διαλογισμοὺς αὐτῶν,
61  κατ᾽ ἐμοῦ. Χείλη ἐπανιστανομένων μοι καὶ μελέτας αὐτῶν κατ᾽
62  ἐμοῦ ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν, καθέδραν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἀνάστασιν αὐτῶν·
63  ἐπίβλεψον ἐπὶ τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτῶν, ἀποδώσεις αὐτοῖς ἀντα-
       πόδομα, Κύριε, κατὰ τὰ ἔργα τῶν χειρῶν αὐτῶν.
                                                      Θαῦ.
64:65 Ἀποδώσεις αὐτοῖς ὑπερασπισμόν, καρδίας μόχθον σοῦ αὐτοῖς.
       Καταδιώξεις ἐν ὀργῇ, καὶ ἐξαναλώσεις αὐτοὺς ὑποκάτω τοῦ οὐ-
       ρανοῦ, Κύριε.
                                                      ΚΕΦ. Δ΄. IV.
                                                      Ἄλεφ.
1    ΠΩΣ ἀμαυρωθήσεται τὸ χρυσίον, ἀλλοιωθήσεται τὸ ἀργύριον
       τὸ ἀγαθόν ; ἐξεχύθησαν λίθοι ἅγιοι, ἐπ᾽ ἀρχῆς πασῶν ἐξόδων.
                                                      Βήθ.
2    Υἱοὶ Σιὼν οἱ τίμιοι, οἱ ἐπηρμένοι ἐν χρυσίῳ, πῶς ἐλογίσθησαν εἰς
       ἄγγεια ὀστράκινα, ἔργα χειρῶν κεραμέως ;
                                                      Γίμελ.
3    Καί γε δράκοντες ἐξέδυσαν μαστούς, ἐθήλασαν σκύμνοι αὐτῶν θυ-
       γατέρας λαοῦ μου εἰς ἀνίατον, ὡς στρουθίον ἐν ἐρήμῳ.
                                                      Δάλεθ.
4    Ἐκολλήθη ἡ γλῶσσα θηλάζοντος πρὸς τὸν φάρυγγα αὐτοῦ ἐν

### Chapter III.

**Tsade.**
**52** [They that hunted have hunted me as a sparrow, even my enemies without cause;] they have slain my life in the pit, and have laid a stone upon me.
**53** Waters have overflowed upon my head; I said, I am cast off.

**Koph.**
**54** I called upon Thy name, O Lord, out of the lowest pit;
**55** Thou heardest my voice; hide not Thine ears from my petition.
**56** Thou drewest near unto my help in the day when I called upon Thee; Thou saidst unto me, Fear not.

**Resh.**
**57** Thou hast pleaded, O Lord, the causes of my soul; Thou hast redeemed my life.
**58** Thou hast seen, O Lord, my troubles; Thou hast judged my cause.
**59** Thou hast seen all their vengeance, and all their thoughts against me.

**Shin.**
**60** Thou hast heard their reproach, [even] all their thoughts against me.
**61** The lips of them that rise up against me, and their devices against me all the day;
**62** Their sitting down, and their rising up: look Thou upon their eyes.
**63** Thou wilt render unto them a recompense, O Lord, according to the works of their hands.

**Tau.**
**64** Thou shalt render unto them a shield [for the] heart, [yea, even] a burden of Thy heart upon them.
**65** Thou shalt pursue them in wrath, and shalt utterly consume them from under heaven, O Lord.

### Chapter IV.

**Aleph.**
**1** How is the gold become dim! How is the good silver changed! The holy stones are poured out at the head of all the streets.

**Beth.**
**2** The precious sons of Zion, who were exalted in gold, how are they accounted as earthen vessels, the work of the hands of the potter?

**Gimel.**
**3** Even dragons have brought forth breasts; their whelps have sucked the daughters of my people unto that which is incurable, like a sparrow in the wilderness.

**Daleth.**
**4** The tongue of the sucking child hath cleaved to the roof of his mouth in [thirst].
