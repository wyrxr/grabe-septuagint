**ΨΑΛΜ. ΠΑʹ. LXXXI.**

5 συνῆκαν, ἐν σκότει διαπορεύονται· σαλευθήσονται πάντα τὰ θεμέλια τῆς γῆς.
6 Ἐγὼ εἶπα· θεοί ἐστε καὶ υἱοὶ ὑψίστου πάντες·
7 ὑμεῖς δὲ ὡς ἄνθρωποι ἀποθνήσκετε, καὶ ὡς εἷς τῶν ἀρχόντων πίπτετε.
8 Ἀνάστα ὁ Θεός, κρῖνον τὴν γῆν· ὅτι σὺ κατακληρονομήσεις (αὐτούς) ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς ἔθνεσιν.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ΠΒʹ. LXXXII.**

1 ὨΔΗ Ψαλμοῦ τῷ Ἀσάφ.
2 Ὁ Θεὸς τίς ὁμοιωθήσεταί σοι; μὴ σιγήσῃς, μηδὲ καταπραΰνῃς ὁ Θεός·
3 ὅτι ἰδοὺ οἱ ἐχθροί σου ἤχησαν, καὶ οἱ μισοῦντές σε ἦραν κεφαλήν.
4 Ἐπὶ τὸν λαόν σου (Κύριε) κατεπανουργεύσαντο γνώμην, καὶ ἐβουλεύσαντο κατὰ τῶν ἁγίων σου·
5 εἶπαν· δεῦτε καὶ ἐξολεθρεύσωμεν αὐτοὺς ἐξ ἔθνους, καὶ οὐ μὴ μνησθῇ τὸ ὄνομα Ἰσραὴλ ἔτι.
6 Ὅτι ἐβουλεύσαντο ἐν δυσνοίᾳ ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό, κατὰ σοῦ διαθήκην διέθεντο
7 τὰ σκηνώματα τῶν Ἰδουμαίων καὶ οἱ Ἰσμαηλῖται, Μωὰβ καὶ οἱ Ἀγαρηνοί,
8 Γεβὰλ καὶ Ἀμμὼν καὶ Ἀμαλήκ, (καὶ) ἀλλόφυλοι μετὰ τῶν κατοικούντων Τύρον·
9 καὶ γὰρ καὶ Ἀσσοὺρ συμπαρεγένετο μετ’ αὐτῶν, ἐγενήθησαν εἰς ἀντίληψιν τοῖς υἱοῖς Λώτ. Διάψαλμα.
10 Ποίησον αὐτοῖς ὡς τῇ Μαδιὰμ καὶ τῷ Σισάρα, ὡς τῷ Ἰαβεὶν ἐν τῷ χειμάρρῳ Κισσῶν·
11 ἐξωλεθρεύθησαν ἐν Ἀενδὼρ, ἐγενήθησαν ὡσεὶ κόπρος τῇ γῇ.
12 Θοῦ τοὺς ἄρχοντας αὐτῶν ὡς τὸν Ὠρὴβ καὶ Ζὴβ, καὶ Ζεβεὲ καὶ Σαλμανὰ πάντας τοὺς ἄρχοντας αὐτῶν·
13 οἵτινες εἶπαν· κληρονομήσωμεν ἑαυτοῖς τὸ ἁγιαστήριον τοῦ Θεοῦ.
14 Ὁ Θεός μου θοῦ αὐτοὺς ὡς τροχὸν, ὡς καλάμην κατὰ πρόσωπον ἀνέμου.
15 Ὡσεὶ πῦρ ὃ διαφλέξει δρυμὸν, ὡσεὶ φλόξ κατακαύσαι ὄρη·
16 οὕτως καταδιώξεις αὐτοὺς ἐν τῇ καταιγίδι σου, καὶ ἐν τῇ ὀργῇ σου ταράξεις αὐτούς.
17 Πλήρωσον τὰ πρόσωπα αὐτῶν ἀτιμίας· καὶ ζητήσουσι τὸ ὄνομά σου Κύριε.
18 Αἰσχυνθήτωσαν καὶ ταραχθήτωσαν εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τοῦ αἰῶνος, καὶ ἐντραπήτωσαν καὶ ἀπωλέσθωσαν·
19 καὶ γνώτωσαν ὅτι ὄνομά σοι Κύριος, σὺ μόνος ὕψιστος ἐπὶ πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν.

**ΨΑΛΜ. ΠΓʹ. LXXXIII.**

1 Εἰς τὸ τέλος, ὑπὲρ τῶν ληνῶν τοῖς υἱοῖς Κορέ ψαλμός.
2 Ὡς ἀγαπητὰ τὰ σκηνώματά σου Κύριε τῶν δυνάμεων.
3 Ἐπιποθεῖ καὶ ἐκλείπει ἡ ψυχή μου εἰς τὰς αὐλὰς τοῦ Κυρίου· ἡ καρδία μου καὶ ἡ σάρξ μου ἠγαλλιάσαντο ἐπὶ Θεὸν ζῶντα.

**PSALM LXXXI.**

5 ...they knew not, neither did they understand;
They walk on in darkness:
All the foundations of the earth shall be shaken.
6 I said, "Ye are gods, and all of you sons of the Most High."
7 But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.
8 Arise, O God, judge the earth,
For Thou shalt inherit [them] among all the nations.

**PSALM LXXXII.**

1 A Song of a Psalm for Asaph.
2 O God, who shall be likened unto Thee?
Be not silent, neither be still, O God!
3 For behold, Thine enemies have made a clamor,
And they that hate Thee have lifted up the head.
4 Against Thy people, O Lord, they have cunningly devised a plan,
And they have consulted against Thy saints.
5 They said, "Come, and let us utterly destroy them from a nation,
And the name of Israel shall no more be remembered."
6 For they have consulted together with ill-will,
They have made a covenant against Thee:
7 The tabernacles of the Idumeans and the Ishmaelites,
Moab and the Hagarites,
8 Gebal and Ammon and Amalek,
And [the] Philistines, with those who dwell in Tyre.
9 For Asshur also hath come with them;
They were made a help to the sons of Lot. *Pause*.
10 Do unto them as unto Midian and to Sisera,
As unto Jabin by the torrent of Kishon.
11 They were utterly destroyed in Endor;
They became as dung for the earth.
12 Make their princes as Oreb and Zeb,
And as Zebah and Zalmunna, all their princes;
13 Who said, "Let us inherit for ourselves the sanctuary of God."
14 O my God, make them as a wheel,
As stubble before the wind.
15 As fire which consumes a forest,
As a flame which burns up mountains,
16 So shalt Thou pursue them with Thy tempest,
And in Thy wrath shalt Thou trouble them.
17 Fill their faces with dishonor,
And they shall seek Thy Name, O Lord.
18 Let them be ashamed and troubled for ever and ever;
Yea, let them be put to shame and perish.
19 And let them know that Thy Name is Lord,
Thou alone art the Most High over all the earth.

**PSALM LXXXIII.**

1 Unto the End, for the winepresses, a Psalm for the sons of Korah.
2 How beloved are Thy tabernacles, O Lord of Hosts!
3 My soul longs and faints for the courts of the Lord;
My heart and my flesh have rejoiced in the living God.
