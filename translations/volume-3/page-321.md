ΚΕΦ. ΚΖ΄. ΚΗ΄ ΙΕΡΕΜΙΑΣ 1259
καὶ τρυφερὰ παρεδόθη, ὅτι ποιήσω συντέλειαν ἐν παντὶ ἔθνει, εἰς
οὓς ἔξωσά σε ἐκεῖ, σὲ δὲ οὐ μὴ ποιήσω ἐκλείπειν, καὶ παιδεύσω
σε εἰς κρίσιν, καὶ ἀθῷον οὐκ ἀθῳώσω σε.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΖ΄. XXVII.
(Hebr. Cap. L.)

Ὁ ΛΟΓΟΣ · ὋΝ ΕΛΑΛΗΣΕ ΚΥΡΙΟΣ ΕΠΙ ΒΑΒΥΛΩΝΑ 1
ἐπὶ γῆν Χαλδαίων ἐν χειρὶ Ἱερεμίου τοῦ προφήτου. Ἀναγγείλατε 2
ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι, καὶ ἀκουστὰ ποιήσατε, καὶ ἐπάρατε σημεῖον,
ἀκουτίσατε, καὶ μὴ κρύψητε· εἴπατε, ἑάλωκε Βαβυλὼν, κατησχύνθη
Βὴλ ἡ ἀπτόητος, ἡ τρυφερὰ παρεδόθη Μαιρωδάχ· ἠσχύνθη
εἴδωλα αὐτῆς, ἠσχύνθη τὰ βδελύγματα αὐτῆς. Ὅτι ἀνέβη ἐπ’ 3
αὐτὴν ἔθνος ἀπὸ βορρᾶ, οὗτος θήσει τὴν γῆν αὐτῆς εἰς ἀφανισμόν,
καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ὁ κατοικῶν ἐν αὐτῇ ἀπὸ ἀνθρώπου καὶ ἕως
κτήνους· ἐσαλεύθησαν, ἀπῆλθον. Ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις, φησὶ 4
Κύριος, καὶ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ, ἥξουσιν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ αὐτοὶ,
καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰούδα ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ βαδίζοντες καὶ κλαίοντες πορεύσονται,
τὸν Κύριον Θεὸν αὐτῶν ζητοῦντες. Ἕως εἰς Σιὼν ἐρωτήσωσι 5
τὴν ὁδὸν, ὧδε γὰρ τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτῶν δώσουσι, καὶ ἥξουσι,
καὶ καταφεύξονται πρὸς Κύριον Θεὸν, διαθήκη γὰρ αἰώνιος οὐκ
ἐπιλησθήσεται. Πρόβατα ἀπολωλότα ἐγεννήθη ὁ λαός μου, οἱ 6
ποιμένες αὐτῶν ἔξωσαν αὐτοὺς, ἐπὶ τὰ ὄρη ἀπεπλάνησαν αὐτούς,
ἐξ ὄρους ἐπὶ βουνὸν ᾤχοντο, ἐπελάθοντο κοίτης αὐτῶν.
Πάντες οἱ εὑρίσκοντες αὐτοὺς κατανάλισκον αὐτοὺς· οἱ ἐχθροὶ 7
αὐτῶν εἶπαν, μὴ ἀνῶμεν αὐτοὺς, ἀνθ’ ὧν ἥμαρτον τῷ Κυρίῳ·
νομὴ δικαιοσύνης τῷ συναγαγόντι τοὺς πατέρας αὐτῶν Κυρίῳ.
Ἀπαλλοτριώθητε ἐκ μέσου Βαβυλῶνος καὶ ἀπὸ γῆς Χαλδαίων 8
καὶ ἐξέλθατε, καὶ γένεσθε ὥσπερ δράκοντες κατὰ πρόσωπον προβάτων.
Ὅτι ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐγείρω καὶ ἀνάγω ἐπὶ Βαβυλῶνα συναγωγὰς 9
ἐθνῶν μεγάλων ἐκ γῆς βορρᾶ, καὶ παρατάξονται αὐτῇ·
ἐκεῖθεν ἁλώσεται τὰ βέλη αὐτῆς, ὡς βολὶς μαχητοῦ συνετοῦ
οὐκ ἐπιστρέψει κενή. Καὶ ἔσται ἡ Χαλδαία εἰς προνομὴν, πάντες 10
οἱ προνομεύσαντες αὐτὴν ἐμπλησθήσονται, λέγει Κύριος. Ὅτι 11
ηὐφραίνεσθε, καὶ κατεκαυχᾶσθε, διαρπάζοντες τὴν κληρονομίαν
μου, διότι ἐσκιρτᾶτε, ὡς βοΐδια ἐν βοτάνῃ, καὶ ἐκερατίζετε ὡς
ταύτῃ.

**Jeremiah 26**
(Hebrew Chapter 46)

**28** ...and the delicate one was delivered. For I will make a full end in every nation, to which I have cast thee out thence; but thee I will not cause to utterly perish. And I will chasten thee into judgment, yet will I not acquit thee of punishment.

**Jeremiah 27**
(Hebrew Chapter 50)

**1** The word which the Lord spake concerning Babylon, and concerning the land of the Chaldeans, by the hand of Jeremiah the prophet.
**2** Declare ye among the nations, and make [it] heard, and lift up a standard; cause [it] to be heard, and hide it not. Say ye, “Babylon is fallen! Bel the undaunted is put to shame; the delicate one was delivered to Merodach. Her idols are put to shame; her abominations are put to shame.”
**3** For a nation from the north hath come up against her; this one shall render her land into utter desolation, and none shall be dwelling therein, from man even unto beast. They were shaken; they departed.
**4** In those days, saith the Lord, and in that time, shall the sons of Israel come, and the sons of Judah together, walking and weeping shall they go, seeking the Lord their God.
**5** Unto Zion shall they inquire the way; for thither shall they give their face, and they shall come, and shall flee unto the Lord God, for an everlasting covenant shall not be forgotten.
**6** My people have been made lost sheep; their shepherds have cast them out; they have made them to wander upon the mountains. From mountain to hill did they go, they forgot their resting-place.
**7** All they that found them did consume them; their enemies said, “Let us not spare them, for that they have sinned against the Lord.” A pasture of righteousness [is] to the Lord, Who gathered their fathers.
**8** Depart ye from the midst of Babylon, and from the land of the Chaldeans, and go ye forth, and be ye as dragons before the face of sheep.
**9** For, behold, I will raise up and bring against Babylon congregations of great nations from the land of the north; and they shall array themselves against her. From thence shall her arrows be seized; like a wise warrior’s dart, it shall not return empty.
**10** And Chaldea shall be for a prey; all they that prey upon her shall be satisfied, saith the Lord.
**11** Because ye rejoiced, and ye boasted yourselves, plundering My inheritance; for ye did skip as heifers in pasture, and ye did butt as to this [one/matter].
