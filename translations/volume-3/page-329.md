ΚΕΦ. ΚΘ. ΙΕΡΕΜΙΑΣ 1267
2 ΤΑΔΕ ΛΕΓΕΙ ΚΥΡΙΟΣ. Ἰδοὺ, ὕδατα ἀναβαίνει ἀπὸ βορρᾶ, καὶ
  ἔξαι εἰς χειμάῤῥουν κατακλύζοντα, καὶ κατακλύσει γῆν καὶ τὸ πλή-
  ρωμα αὐτῆς, πόλιν καὶ τοὺς ἐνοικοῦντας ἐν αὐτῇ· καὶ κεχράξονται οἱ
3 ἄνθρωποι, καὶ ἀλαλάξονται πάντες οἱ κατοικοῦντες τὴν γῆν, ἀπὸ
  φωνῆς ὁρμῆς αὐτοῦ, ἀπὸ τῶν ὅπλων τῶν ποδῶν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀπὸ
  σεισμοῦ τῶν ἁρμάτων αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἤχου τῶν τροχῶν αὐτοῦ· οὐκ
  ἐπέστρεψαν πατέρες ἐφ᾽ υἱοὺς αὐτῶν ἀπὸ ἐκλύσεως χειρῶν αὐτῶν·
4 ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἐρχομένῃ τοῦ ἀπολέσαι πάντας τοὺς ἀλλοφύλους
  καὶ ἀφανιῶ τὴν Τύρον, καὶ τὴν Σιδῶνα, καὶ πάντας τοὺς κατα-
  λοιποὺς τῆς βοηθείας αὐτῶν, ὅτι ἐξολεθρεύσει Κύριος τοὺς ἀλ-
  λοφύλους, τὰς καταλοίπους τῶν νήσων, καὶ Καππαδοκίας.
5 Ἤκει φαλάκρωμα ἐπὶ Γάζαν, ἀπερίπῃ Ἀσκάλων, καὶ τὰ κατάλοιπα
  Ἐνακείμ.
6 Ἕως τίνος κόψεις ἡ μάχαιρα Κυρίου; ἕως τίνος οὐχ ἡσυχάσεις;
  ἀποκατάστηθι εἰς τὸν κολεόν σου, ἀνάπαυσαι, καὶ ἐπάρθητι.
7 Πῶς ἡσυχάσει; καὶ Κύριος ἐνετείλατο αὐτῇ ἐπὶ τὴν Ἀσκάλωνα,
  καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς παραθαλασσίους, ἐπὶ τὰς καταλοίπους ἐπεγερθῆναι.
8 ΤΗ ΙΔΟΥΜΑΙΑ, τάδε λέγει Κύριος τῶν δυνάμεων· οὐκ
  ἔστιν ἔτι σοφία ἐν Θαιμὰν, ἀπώλετο βουλὴ ἐκ συνετῶν, ᾤχετο σο-
  φία αὐτῶν, ἠπατήθη ὁ τόπος αὐτῶν, βαθύνατε ἑαυτοῖς εἰς κάθισιν οἱ
  κατοικοῦντες ἐν Δαιδάν· ὅτι δύσκολα ἐποίησεν· ἤγαγον ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸν ἐν
  χρόνῳ, ᾧ ἐπεσκεψάμην αὐτὸν,
9 ὅτι τρυγηταὶ ἦλθόν σοι, οὐ καταλείψουσι σοι καταλείμματα·
  ὥσπερ κλέπται ἐν νυκτὶ, ἐπιθήσουσί χεῖρας αὐτῶν,
10 ὅτι ἐγὼ κατέσυρα τὸν Ἡσαῦ, ἀνεκαλύψα τὰ κρυπτὰ
   αὐτοῦ, κρυβῆναι οὐ μὴ δύνωνται, ὤλοντο διὰ χεῖρα ἀδελφοῦ
   αὐτοῦ καὶ γείτονος αὐτοῦ,
11 καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ὑπολείπεσθαι ὀρφανὸν σου, ἵνα ζήσηται· καὶ ἐγὼ
   ζήσομαι, καὶ αἱ χῆραι ἐπ᾽ ἐμὲ πεποίθασιν.
12 Ὅτι τάδε λέγει Κύριος· οἷς οὐκ ἦν νόμος πιεῖν τὸ
   ποτήριον, πάντες ἔπιον· καὶ σὺ ἀθωωμένη ἀθωωθήσῃ; οὐ μὴ ἀ-
   θωωθῇς, ὅτι πίνων πίεσαι.
13 Ὅτι κατ᾽ ἐμαυτοῦ ὤμοσα, λέγει
   Κύριος, ὅτι εἰς ἀφανισμὸν καὶ εἰς ἀβατον καὶ εἰς ὀνειδισμὸν, καὶ
   εἰς κατάραν ἔσῃ ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῆς, καὶ πᾶσαι αἱ πόλεις αὐτῆς ἔσον-
   ται ἔρημοι εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα.
14 Ἀκοὴν ἤκουσαν παρὰ Κυρίου, καὶ ἄγ-
   γελους εἰς ἔθνη ἀπέστειλε, συνάχθητε , καὶ παραγένεσθε εἰς
   αὐτὴν, ἀνάστητε εἰς πόλεμον.
15 Ἰδοὺ, μικρὸν δέδωκά σε ἐν ἔθνεσι,
   καὶ εὐκαταφρόνητον ἐν ἀνθρώποις.
16 Ἡ παιγνία σου ἐνεχείρησέ σοι,
   ἰταμία καρδίας σου κατέλυσε τρυμαλιὰς πετρῶν, συνέλαβεν ἰσχὺν

**Jeremiah, Chapter 29**
(Hebrew Chapter 47 and part of Chapter 49)

**2** THUS SAITH THE LORD: Behold, waters ascend from the north, and [it] shall come forth into an overflowing torrent, and shall overwhelm the land and its fullness, the city and those who dwell therein; and the men shall cry out, and all the inhabitants of the earth shall wail,
**3** From the voice of his rushing forth, from the clatter of his horses' hooves, and from the trembling of his chariots, and the sound of his wheels; fathers did not turn back for their sons, from the slackening of their hands.
**4** In the day that cometh, to destroy all the Philistines, and I shall make Tyre to vanish, and Sidon, and all the remnant of their helpers; for the Lord shall utterly destroy the Philistines, the remnant of the islands, and Cappadocia.
**5** Baldness is come upon Gaza, Ashkelon is destroyed, and the remnant of the Enakim.
**6** How long wilt thou strike, O sword of the Lord? How long wilt thou not rest? Return unto thy scabbard, rest, and be sheathed.
**7** How shall it rest, when the Lord hath commanded it against Ashkelon, and against the seacoasts, to be stirred up against the remnant [thereof]?

**CONCERNING IDUMEA**
**8** Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Is there no longer wisdom in Teman? Counsel hath perished from the understanding ones; their wisdom is gone, their place hath been deceived. Dig deep for yourselves into a dwelling, ye who dwell in Dedan; for He hath wrought difficult things; I have brought [calamity] upon him in the time when I visited him,
**9** For grape-gatherers are come unto thee; they shall not leave gleanings unto thee. As thieves in the night, they shall lay their hands [upon thee],
**10** For I have laid bare Esau, I have uncovered his hidden things; they shall not be able to hide themselves. They have perished by the hand of his brother and his neighbor,
**11** And there is no orphan of thine remaining, that he might live; yet I shall live, and the widows have trusted in Me.
**12** For thus saith the Lord: Behold, those for whom it was not lawful to drink the cup, all have drunk thereof; and shalt thou, being acquitted, be acquitted? Thou shalt by no means be acquitted, for drinking thou shalt drink.
**13** For by Myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, that into utter destruction, and into desolation, and into reproach, and into a curse shalt thou be in her midst, and all her cities shall be desolate for ever.
**14** They have heard a report from the Lord, and He hath sent messengers unto the nations, saying, "Gather ye together, and come against her! Arise unto battle!"
**15** Behold, I have made thee small among the nations, and contemptible among men.
**16** Thy sport hath delivered thee over, the insolence of thy heart hath destroyed the holes of the rocks, it hath conceived strength...
