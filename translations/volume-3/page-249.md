οἱ μακρὰν ἀπὸ τῆς δικαιοσύνης. Ἤγγισα τὴν δικαιοσύνην μου, 13
οὐ μὴ μακρυνθῇ, καὶ τὴν σωτηρίαν τὴν παρ᾿ ἐμοῦ οὐ βραδυνῶ·
δέδωκα ἐν Σιὼν σωτηρίαν τῷ Ἰσραὴλ εἰς δόξασμα.

ΚΕΦ. ΜΖ´. XLVII.

ΚΑΤΑΒΗΘΙ, κάθισον ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, παρθένος θυγάτηρ 1
Βαβυλῶνος, κάθισον εἰς τὴν γῆν, οὐκ ἔστι θρόνος· εἴσελθε εἰς
τὸ σκότος, θυγάτηρ Χαλδαίων, ἔτι οὐκέτι προστεθήσῃ κληθῆναι
ἁπαλὴ καὶ τρυφερά. Λάβε μύλον, ἄλεσον ἄλευρον, ἀποκάλυψαι 2
τὰ κατακάλυμμά σου, ἀνακάλυψαι τὰς πολιὰς, ἀνάσυρε τὰς
κνήμας, διάβηθι ποταμούς, ἀνακαλυφθήσεται ἡ αἰσχύνη σου, φα- 3
νήσονται οἱ ὀνειδισμοί σου· τὸ δίκαιον ἐκ σοῦ λήψομαι, οὐκέτι
μὴ παραδῶ ἀνθρώποις. Εἶπεν δ᾽ ἐυσάμενός σε Κύριος Σαβαώθ, 5
ὄνομα αὐτῷ ἅγιος Ἰσραήλ. Κάθισον κατανενυγμένη, εἴσελθε
εἰς τὸ σκότος, θυγάτηρ Χαλδαίων, οὐκέτι μὴ κληθήσῃ ἰσχὺς
βασιλείας. Παρωξύνθην ἐπὶ τῷ λαῷ μου, ἐμίανας τὴν κλη- 6
ρονομίαν μου· καὶ ἐγὼ ἔδωκα αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν χεῖρά σου, σὺ δὲ
οὐκ ἔδωκας αὐτοῖς ἔλεος, τοῦ πρεσβυτέρου ἐβάρυνας τὸν ζυ-
γὸν σφόδρα, καὶ εἶπας, εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα ἔσομαι ἄρχουσα· οὐκ 7
ἐνόησας ταῦτα ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ σου, οὐδὲ ἐμνήσθης τὰ ἔσχατα;
Νῦν δὲ ἄκουσον ταῦτα ἡ τρυφερά, ἡ καθημένη, ἡ πεποιθυῖα, 8
ἡ λέγουσα ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτῆς· ἐγὼ εἰμι, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἑτέρα,
οὐ καθιῶ χήρα, οὐδὲ γνώσομαι ὀρφανίαν. Νῦν δὲ ἥξει ἐπὶ σὲ 9
ἐξαίφνης τὰ δύο ταῦτα ἐν μιᾷ ἡμέρᾳ χηρεία, καὶ ἀτεκνία
ἥξει ἐξαίφνης ἐπὶ σὲ, ἐν τῇ φαρμακείᾳ σου, ἐν τῇ ἰσχύϊ τῶν
ἐπαοιδῶν σου σφόδρα, τῇ ἐλπίδι τῆς πονηρίας σου· σὺ γὰρ εἶπας· 10
ἐγὼ εἰμι καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἑτέρα· γνῶθι ὅτι ἡ σύνεσις τούτων ἔ-
σται, καὶ ἡ πορνεία σου ἔσται σοι αἰσχύνη· καὶ εἶπας τῇ
καρδίᾳ σου, ἐγὼ εἰμι καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἑτέρα. Καὶ ἥξει ἐπὶ σὲ 11
ἀπώλεια, καὶ οὐ μὴ γνῷς, βόθυνος, καὶ ἐμπεσῇ εἰς αὐτόν· καὶ
ἥξει ἐπὶ σὲ ταλαιπωρία, καὶ οὐ μὴ δυνήσῃ καθαρὰ γενέσθαι·
καὶ ἥξει ἐπὶ σὲ ἐξαίφνης ἀπώλεια, καὶ οὐ μὴ γνώσῃ. Στῆθι 12
νῦν ἐν ταῖς ἐπαοιδαῖς σου, καὶ ἐν τῇ πολλῇ φαρμακείᾳ σου,
ἃ ἐμάνθανες ἐκ νεότητός σου, εἰ δυνήσῃ ὠφεληθῆναι, εἴπως δυ- 13
νήσῃ ἰσχῦσαι· κεκοπίακας ἐν ταῖς βουλαῖς σου· ζητήσωσαν δὴ,
καὶ σωσάτωσάν σε οἱ ἀστρολόγοι τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, οἱ ὁρῶντες τοὺς

#### Chapter 46

**13** ye that are far from righteousness.
    I have brought My righteousness near;
    it shall not be put far off,
    and My salvation, [even] that which cometh from Me,
    shall not tarry.
    I have given salvation in Sion
    unto Israel for [a cause of] glory.

#### Chapter 47

**1** Come down, and sit upon the dust,
    O virgin daughter of Babylon;
    sit thou upon the ground:
    for no throne remaineth [for thee].
    Enter thou into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans;
    for thou shalt no more be called
    tender and delicate.
**2** Take the millstone, and grind meal:
    unveil thy coverings;
    uncover thy grey hairs;
    make bare thy legs;
    pass over the rivers.
**3** Thy shame shall be uncovered,
    and thy reproaches shall be seen.
    My just recompense will I take from thee;
    no longer will I deliver [thee] unto men.
**4** Then said He who redeemed thee, [even] the Lord of Sabaoth;
    His name is the Holy One of Israel.
    Sit thou, smitten with sorrow;
    enter into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans;
    thou shalt no more be called the might of kingdoms.
**5** I was wroth with My people;
    thou didst defile Mine inheritance.
    And I delivered them into thy hand;
    but thou didst not show them mercy.
    Upon the elder thou didst heavily lay the yoke,
    and thou didst say, 'I shall be a princess for ever.'
    Thou didst not ponder these things in thy heart,
    nor didst thou remember the latter end [thereof]?
**6** Now hear these things, thou delicate one,
    that sittest [in ease], that art confident;
    that sayest in thine heart,
    'I am, and there is none other beside me;
    I shall not sit as a widow,
    neither shall I know bereavement [of children].'
**7** But now these two things shall come upon thee suddenly
    in one day: widowhood and childlessness;
    yea, they shall come suddenly upon thee,
    with thy sorcery, and with the exceeding might of thine enchantments,
    [even by] the hope of thy wickedness.
**8** For thou didst say,
    'I am, and there is none other [beside me].'
    Know therefore that the understanding of these things
    shall be [unto thee],
    and thy fornication shall be a shame unto thee.
    And thou didst say in thine heart,
    'I am, and there is none other [beside me].'
**9** And ruin shall come upon thee, and thou shalt not know [it];
    a pit, and thou shalt fall into it.
    And distress shall come upon thee,
    and thou shalt not be able to be made clean.
    And ruin shall come upon thee suddenly,
    and thou shalt not know [it].
**10** Stand now in thine enchantments,
    and in thy many sorceries,
    which thou hast learned from thy youth.
**11** If thou shalt be able to profit [thereby],
    if perhaps thou shalt be able to be strong;
    thou hast wearied thyself in thy counsels.
    Let them now seek [to save thee],
    and let them save thee,
    the astrologers of heaven,
    they that behold the stars.
