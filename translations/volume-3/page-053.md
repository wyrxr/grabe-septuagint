ΨΑΛΜ. ΟΑʹ. ΟΒʹ. ΨΑΛΤΗΡΙΟΝ. 991
καὶ πένῆτα ᾧ οὐχ ὑπῆρχε βοηθός· φείσεται πτωχοῦ καὶ πένητος, 13
καὶ ψυχὰς πενήτων σώσει· ἐκ τόκου καὶ ἐξ ἀδικίας λυτρώσεται 14
τὰς ψυχὰς αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔντιμον τὸ ὄνομα αὐτῶν ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ.
Καὶ ζήσεται, καὶ δοθήσεται αὐτῷ ἐκ τοῦ χρυσίου τῆς ᾿Αραβίας· 15
καὶ προσεύξονται περὶ αὐτοῦ διαπαντός, ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν εὐλογή-
σουσιν αὐτόν. ῎Εσται στήριγμα ἐν τῇ γῇ ἐπ’ ἄκρων τῶν ὀρέων, 16
ὑπεραρθήσεται ὑπὲρ τὸν Λίβανον ὁ καρπὸς αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐξανθήσου-
σιν ἐκ πόλεως ὡσεὶ χόρτος τῆς γῆς. ῎Εστω τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ εὐλο- 17
γημένον εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας, πρὸ τοῦ ἡλίου διαμενεῖ τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ·
καὶ εὐλογηθήσονται ἐν αὐτῷ πᾶσαι αἱ φυλαὶ τῆς γῆς, πάντα τὰ
ἔθνη μακαριοῦσιν αὐτόν. Εὐλογητὸς Κύριος ὁ Θεός, ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ 18
Ἰσραήλ, ὁ ποιῶν θαυμάσια μόνος, καὶ εὐλογητὸν τὸ ὄνομα τῆς δό- 19
ξης αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα (καὶ εἰς αἰῶνα αἰῶνος)· καὶ πληρωθήσε-
ται τῆς δόξης αὐτοῦ πᾶσα ἡ γῆ· γένοιτο, γένοιτο. ᾿Εξέλιπον οἱ
ὕμνοι Δαυίδ, τοῦ υἱοῦ ᾿Ιεσσαί.

ΨΑΛΜ. ΟΒʹ. LXXII.

ΨΑΛΜΟΣ τῷ ᾿Ασάφ. Ὡς ἀγαθὸς ὁ Θεὸς τῷ ᾿Ισραήλ, τοῖς 1
εὐθέσι καρδίᾳ. ᾿Εμοῦ δὲ παρὰ μικρὸν ἐσαλεύθησαν οἱ πόδες· παρ’ 2
ὀλίγον ἐξεχύθη τὰ διαβήματά μου. ῞Οτι ἐζήλωσα ἐπὶ τοῖς ἀνό- 3
μοις, εἰρήνην ἁμαρτωλῶν θεωρῶν· ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν ἀνάνευσις ἐν τῷ 4
θανάτῳ αὐτῶν, καὶ στερέωμα ἐν τῇ μάστιγι αὐτῶν· ἐν κόποις ἀν- 5
θρώπων οὐκ εἰσί, καὶ μετὰ ἀνθρώπων οὐ μαστιγωθήσονται. Διὰ 6
τοῦτο ἐκράτησεν αὐτοὺς ἡ ὑπερηφανία· περιεβάλοντο ἀδικίαν καὶ
ἀσέβειαν αὐτῶν, ἐξελεύσατο ὡς ἐκ σέατος ἡ ἀδικία αὐτῶν· διῆλ- 7
θον εἰς διάθεσιν καρδίας. Διενοήθησαν καὶ ἐλάλησαν ἐν πονηρίᾳ, 8
ἀδικίαν εἰς τὸ ὕψος ἐλάλησαν· ἔθεντο εἰς οὐρανὸν τὸ στόμα αὐ- 9
τῶν, καὶ ἡ γλῶσσα αὐτῶν διῆλθεν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς. Διὰ τοῦτο ἐπι- 10
στρέψει ὁ λαός μου ἐνταῦθα· καὶ ἡμέραι πλήρεις εὑρεθήσονται ἐν
αὐτοῖς, καὶ εἶπαν· πῶς ἔγνω ὁ Θεός; καὶ εἰ ἔστι γνῶσις ἐν τῷ 11
ὑψίστῳ; ᾿Ιδοὺ οὗτοι οἱ ἁμαρτωλοὶ καὶ εὐθηνοῦντες εἰς τὸν αἰῶ- 12
να, κατέσχον πλοῦτον. Καὶ εἶπα· ἄρα ματαίως ἐδικαίωσα τὴν 13
καρδίαν μου, καὶ ἐνιψάμην ἐν ἀθώοις τὰς χεῖράς μου· καὶ ἐγενό- 14
μην μεμαστιγωμένος ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν, καὶ ὁ ἔλεγχός μου εἰς τὰς 15
πρωΐας. Εἰ ἔλεγον, διηγήσομαι οὕτως· ἰδοὺ τῇ γενεᾷ τῶν υἱῶν 18
σου ἠσυνθέτηκα.

**PSALM LXXI.**

13 And the poor, who had no helper.
He shall spare the poor and the needy,
And the souls of the needy shall he save.
14 From usury and from iniquity shall he redeem their souls,
And their name shall be precious in his sight.
15 And he shall live, and there shall be given unto him of the gold of Arabia;
And they shall pray for him continually,
All the day long shall they bless him.
16 There shall be a firm establishment in the earth, upon the tops of the mountains;
His fruit shall be exalted above Lebanon;
And they shall spring forth from the city, as the grass of the earth.
17 Let his Name be blessed unto the ages;
Before the sun shall his Name endure.
And in him shall all the tribes of the earth be blessed;
All the nations shall call him blessed.
18 Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel,
Who alone doeth wondrous things.
19 And blessed be the Name of His glory unto the age
(Yea, and unto the age of the age);
And all the earth shall be filled with His glory.
Amen, and Amen.
The hymns of David, the son of Jesse, are ended.

**PSALM LXXII.**

A Psalm of Asaph.

1 How good is God unto Israel,
Even to such as are pure in heart!
2 But as for me, my feet were almost moved;
My steps had well-nigh slipped.
3 For I was envious at the lawless,
When I saw the prosperity of the ungodly.
4 For there are no pangs in their death,
Neither is there strength in their scourging.
5 They are not in the toil of men,
Neither shall they be scourged with men.
6 Therefore hath pride compassed them about as a chain;
They have clothed themselves with their iniquity and their impiety.
Their iniquity hath sprung forth as from their fatness;
7 They have penetrated into the disposition of [their] heart.
8 They have imagined and spoken in wickedness;
Iniquity have they spoken on high.
9 They have set their mouth against the heavens,
And their tongue walketh through the earth.
10 Therefore shall My people return hither,
And a full measure of days shall be found among them.
11 And they say, "How doth God know?
And is there knowledge in the Most High?"
12 Behold, these are the ungodly,
And prospering unto the age, they have obtained riches.
13 Then said I, "Verily, in vain have I cleansed my heart,
And washed my hands in innocency."
14 And I have been scourged all the day long,
And my chastening hath been every morning.
18 Had I spoken thus, [saying], "I will relate [my thoughts],"
Behold, I would have dealt faithlessly with the generation of Thy children.
