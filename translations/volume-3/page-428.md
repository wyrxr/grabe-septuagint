**24** λόγος Κυρίου πρός με, λέγων· υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου, εἰπὸν αὐτῇ· σὺ εἶ γῆ
**25** οὐ βρεχομένη, οὐδὲ ὑετὸς ἐγένετο σοὶ ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ὀργῆς. Οἱ ἀφηγοῦμενοι αὐτῆς ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῆς ὡς λέοντες ἐρευγόμενοι ἁρπάζοντες ἁρπάγματα, ψυχὰς κατεσθίοντες, ἐδυνάστευσαν ἐν δυναστείᾳ, καὶ
**26** τιμὰς λαμβάνοντες· καὶ χῆραί σου ἐπληθύνθησαν ἐν μέσῳ σου, καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς αὐτῆς ἠθέτησαν τὸν νόμον μου, καὶ ἐβεβήλουν τὰ ἅγιά μου· ἀναμέσον ἁγίου καὶ βεβήλου οὐ διέστελλον, καὶ ἀναμέσον ἀκαθάρτου καὶ τοῦ καθαροῦ οὐ διέστελλον, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν σαββάτων μου παρεκάλυπτον τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐβεβηλούμην ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῶν.
**27** Οἱ ἄρχοντες αὐτῆς ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῆς ὡς λύκοι ἁρπάζοντες ἁρπάγματα, τοῦ ἐκχέαι αἷμα, ὅπως πλεονεξίᾳ πλεονεχτῶσι.
**28** Καὶ οἱ προφῆται αὐτῆς οἱ ἀλείφοντες αὐτοὺς πεσοῦνται, οἱ ὁρῶντες μάταια, μαντευόμενοι ψευδῆ, λέγοντες, τάδε λέγει Κύριος,
**29** καὶ Κύριος οὐκ ἐλάλησε· τὸν λαὸν τῆς γῆς ἐκπιέζοντες ἐν ἀδικίᾳ καὶ διαρπάζοντες ἁρπάγματα, πτωχὸν καὶ πένητα καταδυναστεύοντες, καὶ πρὸς τὸν προσήλυτον οὐκ ἀναστρεφόμενοι μετὰ χρήματος.
**30** Καὶ ἐζήτουν ἐξ αὐτῶν ἄνδρα ἀναστρεφόμενον ὀρθῶς, καὶ ἑστῶτα πρὸ προσώπου μου τὸ ὁλοσχερὲς ἐν καιρῷ τῆς ὀργῆς
**31** μου, τοῦ μὴ εἰς τέλος ἐξαλεῖψαι αὐτὴν, καὶ οὐχ εὗρον. Καὶ ἐξέχεα ἐπ᾽ αὐτὴν τὸν θυμόν μου ἐν πυρὶ ὀργῆς μου, τοῦ συντελέσαι αὐτούς· τὰς ὁδοὺς αὐτῶν εἰς κεφαλὰς αὐτῶν δέδωκα, λέγει Κύριος Κύριος.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΓʹ.
**1** Καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρός με, λέγων·
**2** υἱὲ ἀνθρώπου,
**3** δύο γυναῖκες ἦσαν θυγατέρες μητρὸς μιᾶς, καὶ ἐξεπόρνευσαν ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ, ἐν τῇ νεότητι αὐτῶν ἐπόρνευσαν· ἐκεῖ ἔπεσον οἱ μαστοὶ αὐτῶν,
**4** καὶ ἐκεῖ διεπαρθενεύθησαν, καὶ τὰ ὀνόματα αὐτῶν ἦν Ὀολὰ ἡ πρεσβυτέρα, καὶ Ὀολιβὰ ἡ ἀδελφὴ αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐγένοντό μοι, καὶ ἔτεκον υἱοὺς καὶ θυγατέρας, καὶ τὰ ὀνόματα αὐτῶν, Σαμάρεια ἡ
**5** Ὀολὰ, καὶ Ἱερουσαλὴμ Ὀολιβὰ, καὶ ἐξεπόρνευσεν ἡ Ὀολὰ ἀπ᾽ ἐμοῦ, καὶ ἐπέθετο ἐπὶ τοὺς ἐραστὰς αὐτῆς, ἐπὶ τοὺς ᾿Ασσυρίους
**6** τοὺς ἐγγίζοντας αὐτῇ, ἐνδεδυμένους ὑακίνθινα, ἡγουμένους καὶ στρατηγοὺς, νεανίσκους ἐπιλέκτους, πάντες ἱππεῖς ἱππαζόμενοι ἐφ᾽ ἵππων,
**7** καὶ ἔδωκε τὴν πορνείαν αὐτῆς ἐπ᾽ αὐτούς· ἐπίλεκτοι υἱοὶ ᾿Ασσυρίων πάντες, καὶ ἐπὶ πάντας οὓς ἐπέθετο· ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς ἐνθυμήμασιν αὐτῆς ἐμιαίνετο.

**24** Then the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, "Son of man, speak unto her: Thou art a land
**25** that is not watered, neither hath rain fallen upon thee in the day of wrath. Her princes in the midst of her are like roaring lions, seizing plunder, devouring souls; they have oppressed with [great] might, and
**26** have taken bribes. And thy widows were multiplied in thy midst. And her priests have transgressed My law, and profaned My holy things; they made no distinction between the holy and the profane, and between the unclean and the clean did they make no distinction; and from My Sabbaths did they hide their eyes, and I was profaned in their midst.
**27** Her princes in the midst of her are like wolves seizing plunder, to shed blood, that they may gain excessively by greed.
**28** And her prophets, who whitewash them, shall fall, they that see vain things, divining falsehoods, saying, 'Thus saith the Lord,'
**29** when the Lord hath not spoken. They that oppress the people of the land with injustice, and plunder spoil, oppressing the poor and needy, and not dealing with the sojourner concerning [his] money.
**30** And I sought among them a man that would walk uprightly, and stand wholly before My face in the time of [My] wrath,
**31** that I should not utterly destroy her; and I found none. So I have poured out My wrath upon her with the fire of My indignation, to consume them; their ways have I brought upon their own heads, saith the Lord, the Lord."

### Chapter 23

**1** And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
**2** "Son of man,
**3** there were two women, daughters of one mother, and they committed whoredom in Egypt; in their youth did they commit whoredom. There were their breasts pressed [by men],
**4** and there was their virginity broken. And their names were Oholah the elder, and Oholibah her sister. And they became Mine, and they bore sons and daughters. And their names were: Samaria is Oholah,
**5** and Jerusalem, Oholibah. And Oholah committed whoredom, departing from Me, and she lusted after her lovers, even after the Assyrians
**6** that were nigh unto her, clothed in garments of hyacinth [blue], governors and captains, choice young men, all of them horsemen riding upon horses.
**7** And she bestowed her whoredom upon them; [even] upon all the choice sons of the Assyrians, and upon all those whom she lusted after; in all her [lustful] thoughts she was defiled."
