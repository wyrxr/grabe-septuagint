4 εἰ ἐκδικήσω αὐτοὺς ἐκδικήσει· υἱὲ
  πατέρων αὐτῶν διαμάρτυραι αὐτοῖς,
  λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεός· ἀφ᾿ ἧς ἡμέρας
5 καὶ ἐγνωρίσθην τῷ σπέρματι τοῦ οἴκου Ἰακώβ, καὶ ἐγνώσθην
  αὐτοῖς ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ. καὶ ἀντελαβόμην τῇ χειρί μου αὐτῶν, λέ-
6 γων, ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ Θεός ὑμῶν. Ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἀντελαβό-
  μην τῇ χειρί μου αὐτῶν, τοῦ ἐξαγαγεῖν αὐτοὺς ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου
  εἰς τὴν γῆν, ἣν ἡτοίμασα αὐτοῖς, ῥέουσαν γάλα καὶ μέλι, κη-
7 ρίου ἐστὲ παρὰ πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν. Καὶ εἶπα πρὸς αὐτούς· ἕκα-
  στος τὰ βδελύγματα τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν αὐτοῦ ἀποριψάτω, καὶ ἐν
  τοῖς ἐπιτηδεύμασιν Αἰγύπτου μὴ μιαίνεσθε, ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς
8 ὑμῶν. Καὶ ἀπέστησαν ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησαν εἰσακοῦσαί
  μου· ἕκαστος τὰ βδελύγματα τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν αὐτῶν οὐκ ἀπέῤῥι-
9 ψαν, καὶ τὰ ἐπιτηδεύματα Αἰγύπτου οὐκ ἐγκατέλιπον· καὶ εἶπον
  τοῦ ἐκχέαι τὸν θυμόν μου ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς, τοῦ συντελέσαι τὴν ὀργήν
  μου ἐν αὐτοῖς ἐν μέσῳ γῆς Αἰγύπτου. Καὶ ἐποίησα ὅπως τὸ
10 ὄνομά μου τὸ παράπαν μὴ βεβηλωθῇ ἐνώπιον τῶν ἐθνῶν, ὧν αὐτοί
   εἰσιν ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῶν, ἐν οἷς ἐγνώσθην πρὸς αὐτοὺς ἐνώπιον αὐ-
   τῶν, τοῦ ἐξαγαγεῖν αὐτοὺς ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου. Καὶ ἐξήγαγον
11 αὐτοὺς ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, καὶ ἤγαγον αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν ἔρημον,
   καὶ ἔδωκα αὐτοῖς τὰ προστάγματά μου, καὶ τὰ δικαιώματά μου
   ἐγνώρισα αὐτοῖς, ὅσα ποιήσει αὐτὰ ἄνθρωπος, καὶ ζήσεται ἐν
12 αὐτοῖς. Καὶ τὰ σάββατά μου ἔδωκα αὐτοῖς, τοῦ εἶναι εἰς ση-
   μεῖον ἀναμέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ ἀναμέσον αὐτῶν, τοῦ γνῶναι αὐτοὺς,
   διότι ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ ἁγιάζων αὐτούς. Καὶ εἶπα πρὸς τὸν οἶ-
13 κον τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ· ἐν τοῖς προστάγμασί μου πορεύ-
   εσθε, καὶ τὰ δικαιώματά μου φυλάσσετε τοῦ ποιεῖν αὐτὰ, ἃ ποι-
   ἤσει αὐτὰ ἄνθρωπος, καὶ ζήσεται ἐν αὐτοῖς. Καὶ παρεπίκραναν
   με ὁ οἶκος Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ· ἐν τοῖς προστάγμασί μου οὐκ ἐ-
   πορεύθησαν, καὶ τὰ δικαιώματά μου ἀπώσαντο, ἃ ποιήσει αὐτὰ
   ἄνθρωπος, καὶ ζήσεται ἐν αὐτοῖς· καὶ τὰ σάββατά μου ἐβεβήλω-
   σαν σφόδρα· καὶ εἶπα τοῦ ἐκχέαι τὸν θυμόν μου ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς ἐν
14 τῇ ἐρήμῳ, τοῦ ἐξαναλῶσαι αὐτούς. Καὶ οὐκ ἐποίησα, ὅπως τὸ
   ὄνομά μου τὸ παράπαν μὴ βεβηλωθῇ ἐνώπιον τῶν ἐθνῶν, ὧν ἐξή-
   γαγεν αὐτοὺς κατ᾿ ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐγὼ ἐξῆρα τὴν χεῖ-
15 ρά μου ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ τὸ παράπαν, τοῦ μὴ εἰσαγαγεῖν

### Chapter 20

**4** Shall I indeed avenge them with vengeance? O son of their fathers, bear thou witness unto them," saith the Lord God.
**5** "From the day wherein I made Myself known unto the seed of the house of Jacob, yea, made Myself known unto them in the land of Egypt; and I took them by My hand, saying, 'I am the Lord your God.'
**6** In that selfsame day I took them by My hand, to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt into the land which I had prepared for them, a land flowing with milk and honey. Ye are of a honeycomb, beyond all the land.
**7** And I said unto them: 'Let each man cast away the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the practices of Egypt; I am the Lord your God.'
**8** But they turned away from Me, and would not hearken unto Me; each man did not cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the practices of Egypt. Then I said that I would pour out My fury upon them, and accomplish My wrath among them in the midst of the land of Egypt.
**9** Yet I wrought for My Name's sake, that it should not altogether be profaned before the nations, among whom they were, in the midst of them, among whom I made Myself known unto them, before the eyes of those nations, that I might bring them forth out of the land of Egypt.
**10** So I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and led them into the wilderness,
**11** and I gave them My statutes, and My judgments I made known unto them, which if a man do, he shall live by them.
**12** Moreover My Sabbaths I gave them, to be a sign between Me and between them, that they might know that I am the Lord who doth sanctify them.
**13** And I said unto the house of Israel in the wilderness, 'Walk ye in My statutes, and keep My judgments to do them, which if a man do, he shall live by them.' But the house of Israel provoked Me in the wilderness; they walked not in My statutes, and My judgments they rejected, which if a man do, he shall live by them; and My Sabbaths they greatly profaned. Then I said that I would pour out My wrath upon them in the wilderness, to consume them.
**14** Yet I acted not, that My Name should not altogether be profaned before the nations, before whose eyes I had brought them forth.
**15** And I lifted up My hand against them in the wilderness altogether, that I might not bring [them] into
