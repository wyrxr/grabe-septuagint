**ΚΕΦ. ΙΓʹ. ΙΔʹ. Ὡ Σ Η Ε. 1467**
**14** τούς, ἐκ θανάτου λυτρώσομαι αὐτοῦ· ποῦ ἡ δίκη σου, θάνατε;
    ποῦ τὸ κέντρον σου, ᾅδη; Παράκλησις κέκρυπται ἀπὸ ὀφθαλμῶν
    μου· διότι οὗτος ἀνάμεσον ἀδελφῶν διαστελεῖ.
**15** Ἐπάξει ἄνεμον
    καύσωνα ἐκ τῆς ἐρήμου Κύριος ἐπ᾿ αὐτόν, καὶ ἀναξηρανεῖ τὰς
    φλέβας αὐτοῦ, ἐξηρημώσει τὰς πηγὰς αὐτοῦ· οὗτος καταξηρανεῖ
    τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη τὰ ἐπιθυμητὰ αὐτοῦ.
**16** Ἀφανισθήσεται Σαμάρεια, ὅτι ἀντέστη πρὸς τὸν Θεὸν αὐτῆς· ἐν ῥομ-
    φαίᾳ πεσοῦνται αὐτοί, καὶ τὰ ὑποτίτθια αὐτῶν ἐδαφισθήσονται,
    καὶ αἱ ἐν γαστρὶ ἔχουσαι αὐτῶν διαῤῥαγήσονται.

**ΚΕΦ. ΙΔʹ. XIV.**

**1** ἘΠΙΣΤΡΑΦΗΘΙ Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς Κύριον τὸν Θεόν σου, διότι
    ἠσθένησας ἐν ταῖς ἀδικίαις σου.
**2** Λάβετε μεθ᾿ ἑαυτῶν λόγους, καὶ
    ἐπιστρέφθητε πρὸς Κύριον τὸν Θεὸν ὑμῶν· εἴπατε αὐτῷ, ὅπως μὴ
    λάβητε ἀδικίαν, καὶ λάβετε ἀγαθά, καὶ ἀνταποδώσωμεν καρπὸν
    χειλέων ἡμῶν.
**3** Ἀσσοὺρ οὐ μὴ σώσῃ ἡμᾶς, ἐφ᾿ ἵππον οὐκ ἀναβη-
    σόμεθα· οὐκ ἔτι μὴ εἴπωμεν, θεοὶ ἡμῶν, τοῖς ἔργοις τῶν χει-
    ρῶν ἡμῶν· ὁ ἐν σοὶ ἐλεήσει ὀρφανόν.
**4** Ἰάσομαι τὰς κατοικίας αὐ-
    τῶν, ἀγαπήσω αὐτοὺς ὁμολόγως, διότι ἀποστρέψω τὴν ὀργήν
    μου ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ.
**5** Καὶ ἔσομαι ὡς δρόσος τῷ Ἰσραήλ, ἀνθήσει ὡς
    κρίνον, καὶ βαλεῖ τὰς ῥίζας αὐτοῦ ὡς Λίβανος·
**6** πορεύσονται οἱ
    κλάδοι αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔσται ὡς ἐλαία κατάκαρπος, καὶ ἡ ὀσφρασία
    αὐτοῦ ὡς Λιβάνου·
**7** ἐπιστρέψουσι καὶ καθιοῦνται ὑπὸ τὴν σκέπην
    αὐτοῦ, ζήσονται καὶ μεθυσθήσονται σίτῳ· καὶ ἐξανθήσει ὡς ἄμ-
    πελος τὸ μνημόσυνον αὐτοῦ, ὡς οἶνος Λιβάνου.
**8** Τῷ Ἐφραὶμ τί
    ἔτι αὐτῷ καὶ εἰδώλοις; ἐγὼ ἐταπείνωσα αὐτόν, καὶ ἐγὼ κατ-
    ισχύσω αὐτόν· ἐγὼ ὡς ἄρκευθος πυκάζουσα, ἐξ ἐμοῦ ὁ καρπός σου
    εὕρηται.
**9** Τίς σοφὸς καὶ συνήσει ταῦτα, ἢ συνετὸς καὶ ἐπιγνώσε-
    ται αὐτά; διότι εὐθεῖαι αἱ ὁδοὶ τοῦ Κυρίου, καὶ δίκαιοι πορεύσον-
    ται ἐν αὐταῖς, οἱ δὲ ἀσεβεῖς ἀσθενήσουσιν ἐν αὐταῖς.

**CHAPTER 13**

**14** From the hand of Hades will I ransom them; from death will I redeem him. O Death, where is thy judgment? O Hades, where is thy sting? Consolation is hidden from Mine eyes; because this one shall separate among brethren.
**15** The Lord shall bring a scorching wind upon him out of the desert, and shall dry up his springs, yea, his fountains shall He make desolate; this [wind] shall dry up his land, and all his desirable vessels.
**16** Samaria shall be made desolate, because she hath rebelled against her God. They shall fall by the sword, and their suckling infants shall be dashed to the ground, and their pregnant women shall be ripped open.

**CHAPTER 14**

**1** Return, O Israel, unto the Lord thy God; for thou hast stumbled in thine iniquities.
**2** Take with you words, and turn to the Lord your God. Say unto Him, 'That ye may take away iniquity, and receive good things; and we shall render the fruit of our lips.'
**3** Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses. Neither will we say any more, 'Ye are our gods,' to the works of our hands; for in Thee the fatherless findeth mercy.
**4** I will heal their habitations; I will love them sincerely, for I will turn away My wrath from him.
**5** And I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall blossom as a lily, and shall cast forth his roots as Lebanon.
**6** His branches shall spread, and he shall be as a fruitful olive tree, and his fragrance as of Lebanon.
**7** They shall return, and shall sit under his shelter; they shall live and be made abundant with grain. And his memorial shall blossom as a vine, as the wine of Lebanon.
**8** O Ephraim, what concern hath he yet with idols? I have humbled him, and I will strengthen him. I am as a thick juniper tree; from Me is thy fruit found.
**9** Who is wise, and shall understand these things? or discerning, and shall know them? For straight are the ways of the Lord, and the righteous shall walk in them; but the ungodly shall stumble therein.
