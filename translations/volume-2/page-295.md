ΚΕΦ. Δʹ. Εʹ. ΤΩΝ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ ΙΟΥΔΑ Βʹ. 771
Θεοῦ, στύλους δύο, καὶ ἐπ᾿ αὐτῶν γωλὰθ τῇ χῳδαρὲθ ἐπὶ τῶν κε- 12
φαλῶν τῶν στύλων δύο, καὶ δίκτυα δύο συγκαλύψαι τὰς κεφα-
λὰς τῶν χωδαρὲθ ἃ ἐστιν ἐπάνω τῶν κεφαλῶν τῶν στύλων, καὶ 13
κώδωνας χρυσοῦς τετρακοσίους εἰς τὰ δύο δίκτυα, καὶ δύο γένη
ῥοΐσκων ἐν τῷ δικτύῳ τῷ ἑνί, τοῦ συγκαλύψαι τὰς δύο γωλὰθ
τῶν χωδαρὲθ ἃ ἐστιν ἐπάνω τῶν στύλων· καὶ τὰς Μεχωνὼθ ἐποίη- 14
σε δέκα, καὶ τοὺς λουτῆρας ἐποίησεν ἐπὶ τῶν Μεχωνώθ. Καὶ τὴν 15
θάλασσαν μίαν, καὶ τοὺς μόσχους τοὺς δώδεκα ὑποκάτω αὐτῆς·
καὶ τοὺς ποδιστήρας, καὶ τοὺς ἀναλημπτῆρας, καὶ τοὺς λέβητας, 16
καὶ τὰς κρεάγρας, καὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη αὐτῶν ἃ ἐποίησε Χειράμ,
καὶ ἀνήνεγκε τῷ βασιλεῖ Σαλωμὼν ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου, χαλκοῦ κα-
θαροῦ. Ἐν τῷ περιχώρῳ τοῦ Ἰορδάνου ἐχώνευσεν αὐτὰ ὁ βασι- 17
λεὺς, ἐν τῷ πάχει τῆς γῆς ἐν Σοκχώθ, καὶ ἀναμέσον Σα-
ρηδαβά. Καὶ ἐποίησε Σαλωμὼν πάντα τὰ σκεύη ταῦτα εἰς πλῆ- 18
θος σφόδρα, ὅτι οὐκ ἐξέλειπεν ὀλκὴ τοῦ χαλκοῦ. Καὶ ἐποίησε 19
Σαλωμὼν πάντα τὰ σκεύη οἴκου Κυρίου, καὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον τὸ
χρυσοῦν, καὶ τὰς τραπέζας, καὶ ἐπ᾿ αὐτῶν ἄρτοι προθέσεως. Καὶ 20
τὰς λυχνίας, καὶ τοὺς λύχνους τοῦ φωτὸς κατὰ τὸ κρίμα, καὶ
κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ Δαβείρ, χρυσίου καθαροῦ, καὶ λαβίδες αὐ- 21
τῶν, καὶ οἱ λύχνοι αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰς φιάλας, καὶ τὰς θύσκας, καὶ
τὰ πυρεῖα, χρυσίου καθαροῦ, καὶ ἡ θύρα τοῦ οἴκου ἡ ἐσωτέρα εἰς 22
τὰ ἅγια τῶν ἁγίων, καὶ τὰς θύρας τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ ναοῦ χρυσᾶς.

ΚΕΦ. Εʹ. V.
ΚΑΙ συνετελέσθη πᾶσα ἡ ἐργασία ἣν ἐποίησε Σαλωμὼν ἐν 1
οἴκῳ Κυρίου. Καὶ εἰσήνεγκε Σαλωμὼν τὰ ἅγια Δαυὶδ τοῦ πατρὸς
αὐτοῦ, τὸ ἀργύριον, καὶ τὸ χρυσίον, καὶ τὰ σκεύη ἔδωκεν εἰς θη-
σαυρὸν οἴκου Κυρίου. Τότε ἐξεκλησίασε Σαλωμὼν τοὺς πρεσβυ- 2
τέρους Ἰσραήλ, καὶ πάντας τοὺς ἄρχοντας τῶν φυλῶν, τοὺς ἡγου-
μένους τῶν πατριῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ, τοῦ ἀνε- 3
νέγκαι κιβωτὸν διαθήκης Κυρίου ἐκ πόλεως Δαυίδ, αὕτη Σιών. Καὶ
ἐξεκλησιάσθησαν πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα πᾶς ἀνὴρ Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τῇ ἑορτῇ,
οὗτος ὁ μὴν ἕβδομος. Καὶ ἦλθον πάντες οἱ πρεσβύτεροι Ἰσραήλ, 4
καὶ ἔλαβον πάντες οἱ Λευῖται τὴν κιβωτόν. Καὶ ἀνήνεγκαν τὴν 5

**The Second Book of Chronicles**
**CHAPTER 4**

¹² for the House of God, two pillars; and upon them Gōlath unto the Chōdareth, upon the capitals of the two pillars; and two networks to cover the capitals of the Chōdareth, which were upon the capitals of the pillars.
¹³ And four hundred bells of gold for the two networks; and two rows of pomegranates in the one network, to cover the two Gōlath of the Chōdareth, which were upon the pillars.
¹⁴ And the Mechōnōth he made ten, and the lavers he made upon the Mechōnōth.
¹⁵ And the one Sea, and the twelve calves beneath it.
¹⁶ And the pedestals, and the basins, and the kettles, and the flesh-hooks; and all their vessels which Huram made, and brought unto King Solomon in the House of the Lord, of pure bronze.
¹⁷ In the region of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the depth of the ground, in Sōchōth, and betwixt Saredaba.
¹⁸ And Solomon made all these vessels in very great abundance; for the weight of the bronze failed not.
¹⁹ And Solomon made all the vessels for the House of the Lord: the altar of gold, and the tables, and upon them the bread of the Presence.
²⁰ And the lampstands, and the lamps for the light, according to their ordinance, and before the Oracle, of pure gold;
²¹ And the snuffers thereof, and their lamps, and the bowls, and the sacrificial cups, and the firepans, of pure gold;
²² And the inner door of the House, [leading] into the Most Holy Place; and the doors of the House of the Temple, of gold.

**CHAPTER 5**

¹ Thus all the work that Solomon wrought for the House of the Lord was finished. And Solomon brought in the holy things of David his father: the silver, and the gold, and the vessels did he place into the treasury of the House of the Lord.
² Then did Solomon assemble the elders of Israel, and all the chiefs of the tribes, the heads of the fathers' houses of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem,
³ to bring up the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord from the city of David, which is Zion. And all the men of Israel were assembled unto the king at the feast, which was in the seventh month.
⁴ Then came all the elders of Israel; and all the Levites took up the Ark.
⁵ And they brought up the Ark, and the Tabernacle of Testimony, and all the vessels [of the sanctuary] which were therein.
