ἔστη ἐν τῷ προτειχίσματι. Καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ὁ μετὰ Ἰωάβ ἐνομοῦσαν 16
καταβαλεῖν τὸ τεῖχος. Καὶ ἐβόησε γυνὴ σοφὴ ἐκ τοῦ τείχους,
καὶ εἶπεν· ἀκούσατε, ἀκούσατε, εἴπατε δὴ πρὸς τὸν Ἰωάβ,
ἔγγισον ἕως ὧδε, καὶ λαλήσω πρὸς αὐτόν. Καὶ ἤγγισε πρὸς αὐτόν. 17
Καὶ εἶπεν ἡ γυνή· εἰ σὺ εἶ Ἰωάβ; ὁ δὲ εἶπεν· ἐγώ. Εἶπε
δὲ αὐτῷ· ἄκουσον τοὺς λόγους τῆς δούλης σου. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰωάβ·
ἀκούω, ἐγώ εἰμι. Καὶ εἶπε λέγουσα· λόγον ἐλάλησαν ἐν πρώτοις, 18
λέγοντες· ἠρωτημένος ἠρωτήθη ἐν τῇ Ἀβέλ, καὶ ἐν Δάν,
εἰ ἐξέλειπον ἃ ἔθεντο οἱ πιστοὶ τοῦ Ἰσραήλ. (ἐρωτῶντες ἐπερωτῶσιν ἐν Ἀβέλ,) καὶ οὕτως εἰ ἐξέλειπον. Ἐγώ εἰμι εἰρηνικὰ 19
τῶν στρατημάτων Ἰσραήλ, σὺ δὲ ζητεῖς θανατῶσαι πόλιν καὶ μη-
τρόπολιν ἐν Ἰσραήλ· καὶ ἐνατὶ καταποντίζεις κληρονομίαν Κυρίου;
Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Ἰωάβ, καὶ εἶπεν· Ἰλεώς, Ἰλεώς μοι, εἰ καταποντιῶ, 20
καὶ εἰ διαφθερῶ. οὐχ οὕτως ὁ λόγος, ὅτι ἀνήρ ἐξ ὄρους Ἐφραΐμ, 21
Σαβεὲ υἱὸς Βοχορεί ὄνομα αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπῆρε τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ
τὸν βασιλέα Δαυίδ. δότε αὐτὸν μοι μόνον, καὶ ἀπελεύσομαι ἀπάνωθεν τῆς πόλεως. Καὶ εἶπεν ἡ γυνὴ πρὸς Ἰωάβ· Ἰδοὺ κεφαλὴ 22
αὐτοῦ ῥιφήσεται πρὸς σὲ διὰ τοῦ τείχους. Καὶ εἰσῆλθεν ἡ γυνὴ πρὸς
πάντα τὸν λαόν, καὶ ἐλάλησε πρὸς πᾶσαν τὴν πόλιν ἐν τῇ σοφίᾳ αὐτῆς· καὶ ἀφεῖλε τὴν κεφαλὴν Σαβεὲ υἱοῦ Βοχορεί, καὶ ἀφεῖλε καὶ ἔβαλε πρὸς Ἰωάβ. Καὶ ἐσάλπισεν ἐν τῇ κερατίνῃ,
καὶ διεσπάρησαν ἀπὸ τῆς πόλεως ἀπ᾽ αὐτοῦ, ἀνὴρ εἷς τὰ σκηνώματα αὐτοῦ. Καὶ Ἰωάβ ἀπέστρεψεν εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ πρὸς τὸν
βασιλέα. Καὶ Ἰωάβ πρὸς πάσῃ τῇ δυνάμει Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ Βαναίας 23
υἱὸς Ἰωδαὲ ἐπὶ τοῦ Χερεθεεί, καὶ ἐπὶ τοῦ Φελεθεεί. Καὶ 24
Ἀδωνιράμ ἐπὶ τοῦ φόρου· καὶ Ἰωσαφὰτ υἱὸς Ἀχιλουδ ἀναμιμνήσκων· καὶ Σουσά γραμματεύς· καὶ Σαδώκ καὶ Ἀβιάθαρ ἱερεῖς. 25
Καί γε Ειράς ὁ Ἰαειρεί ἦν ἱερεὺς τῷ Δαυίδ. 26

ΚΕΦ. ΚΑ΄.

ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο λιμὸς ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις Δαυὶδ τρία ἔτη, ἐνιαυτοὺς 1
ἐχόμενος ἐνιαυτοῦ. Καὶ ἐζήτησε Δαυὶδ τὸ πρόσωπον τοῦ
Κυρίου. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος, ἐπὶ Σαούλ καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ
ἀδικία (διὰ τὸ αὐτὸν θανατῶσαι θανάτῳ αἱμάτων) περὶ οὗ ἐθανά-
τωσε τοὺς Γαβαωνίτας. Καὶ ἐκάλεσεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Δαυὶδ τοὺς Γα- 2
βαωνίτας, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτούς.

**CHAPTER 20**

**15** [And Joab was there, and the host with him.] And the wall stood within the rampart; and all the people who were with Joab were devouring [the city] to throw down the wall.

**16** Then a wise woman cried out from the wall, and said, 'Hearken, hearken! Speak now unto Joab, draw nigh hither, and I will speak with him.'

**17** And he drew nigh unto her. And the woman said, 'Art thou Joab?' And he said, 'I am.' Then she said unto him, 'Hearken unto the words of thine handmaid.' And Joab said, 'I hear; I am he.'

**18** And she spake, saying, 'A word they spake in former times, saying, "Whoso asked, was surely asked in Abel, and in Dan, whether they had failed in those things which the faithful of Israel had established." (Indeed, enquiring ones do enquire in Abel,) and thus, if they failed.'

**19** I am of those who are peaceable among the hosts of Israel, but thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother-city in Israel. And why dost thou swallow up the inheritance of the Lord?'

**20** And Joab answered and said, 'Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy!

**21** Not so is the matter, but a man from Mount Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri is his name, hath lifted up his hand against King David. Deliver him to me alone, and I will depart from the city.' And the woman said unto Joab, 'Behold, his head shall be cast unto thee over the wall.'

**22** Then the woman went in unto all the people, and spake unto all the city according to her wisdom; and she took off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and took it and cast it unto Joab. And he blew the horn, and they were dispersed from the city from him, every man to his own tents. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the King.

**23** And Joab was unto all the host of Israel. And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites, and over the Pelethites.

**24** And Adoniram was over the tribute; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder.

**25** And Shesha was the scribe; and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests.

**26** And moreover, Ira the Jairite was a priest unto David.

**CHAPTER 21**

**1** Now there was a famine in the days of David for three years, year after year. And David sought the face of the Lord. And the Lord said, 'There is unrighteousness upon Saul and upon his house (because he slew them with a bloody death) concerning that which he put to death the Gibeonites.'

**2** And King David called the Gibeonites, and spake unto them.
