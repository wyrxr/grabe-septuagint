δομημένος πρὸ τούτου ἔτη πολλά, καὶ βασιλεὺς τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ μέγας ᾠκοδόμησεν αὐτόν, καὶ κατηρτίσατο αὐτοῖς. Ἀφότου δὲ 12 παρώργισαν οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν τὸν Θεὸν τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, ἔδωκεν αὐτοὺς εἰς χεῖρας Ναβουχοδονόσορ βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος τοῦ Χαλδαίου, καὶ τὸν οἶκον τοῦτον κατέλυσε, καὶ τὸν λαὸν ἀπῴκισεν εἰς Βαβυλῶνα. Ἀλλ᾽ ἐν ἔτει πρώτῳ Κύρου τοῦ βασιλέως, Κῦρος ὁ βασιλεὺς ἔθετο γνώμην τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦτον οἰκοδομηθῆναι. Καὶ 14 τὰ σκεύη τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ Θεοῦ τὰ χρύσεα καὶ τὰ ἀργυρᾶ, ἃ Ναβουχοδονόσορ ἐξήνεγκεν ἀπὸ οἴκου τοῦ ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἀπήνεγκεν αὐτὰ εἰς ναὸν τοῦ βασιλέως, ἐξήνεγκεν αὐτὰ Κῦρος ὁ βασιλεὺς ἀπὸ ναοῦ τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ ἔδωκε τῷ Σασαβασσάρῳ τῷ θησαυροφύλακι, τῷ ἐπὶ τοῦ θησαυροῦ, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· πάντα τὰ 15 σκεύη λάβε καὶ πορεύου, θὲς αὐτὰ ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τῷ ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ εἰς τὸν τόπον αὐτῶν. Τότε Σασαβασσὰρ ἐκεῖνος ἦλθε, καὶ ἔδωκε 16 θεμελίους τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἀπὸ τότε ἕως νῦν ᾠκοδομήθη, καὶ οὐκ ἐτελέσθη. Καὶ νῦν εἰ ἐπὶ τὸν βασιλέα 17 ἀγαθόν, ἐπισκεπήτω ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τῆς Γάζης τοῦ βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος, ὅπως γνῷς ὅτι ἀπὸ τοῦ βασιλέως Κύρου ἐτέθη γνώμη οἰκοδομῆσαι τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐκεῖνον τὸν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ· καὶ γνοὺς ὁ βασιλεὺς περὶ τούτου, πεμψάτω πρὸς ἡμᾶς.

ΚΕΦ. Ϛ΄. VI.

ΤΟΤΕ Δαρεῖος ὁ βασιλεὺς ἔθηκε γνώμην, καὶ ἐπεσκέψατο 1 ἐν ταῖς βιβλιοθήκαις ὅπου ἡ Γάζα κεῖται ἐν Βαβυλῶνι. Καὶ εὑρέθη 2 ἐν Ἀμαθὰ ἐν πόλει ἐν τῇ βάρεϊ κεφαλὶς μία, καὶ τοῦτο ἦν γεγραμμένον ἐν αὐτῇ ὑπόμνημα. Ἐν ἔτει πρώτῳ Κύρου βασιλέως. Κῦρος 3 ὁ βασιλεὺς ἔθηκε γνώμην περὶ οἴκου τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ· οἶκος οἰκοδομηθήτω, καὶ τόπος οὗ θυσιάζουσι τὰ θυσιάσματα· καὶ ἔθηκεν ἔπαρμα ὕψος πήχεις ἑξήκοντα, πλάτος αὐτοῦ πήχεων ἑξήκοντα. Καὶ δόμοι λίθινοι κραταιοὶ τρεῖς, καὶ δόμος ξύλινος 4 εἷς, καὶ ἡ δαπάνη ἐξ οἴκου τοῦ βασιλέως δοθήσεται. Καὶ τὰ σκεύη 5 οἴκου τοῦ Θεοῦ τὰ ἀργυρᾶ καὶ τὰ χρύσεα, ἃ Ναβουχοδονόσορ ἐξήνεγκεν ἀπὸ οἴκου τοῦ ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ καὶ ἐκόμισεν εἰς Βαβυλῶνα, καὶ δοθήτω καὶ ἀπελθάτω εἰς τὸν ναὸν τὸν ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐπὶ τόπου οὗ ἐτέθη ἐν οἴκῳ τοῦ Θεοῦ. Νῦν δώσετε ἔπαρχοι πέραν τοῦ 6 ποταμοῦ

**EZRA. CHAPTER 5.**

¹¹ ...built many years before this time, and a great King of Israel built it, and furnished it unto them.
¹² But since our fathers provoked the God of Heaven to wrath, He gave them into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, and he overthrew this house and carried the people away into Babylon.
¹³ But in the first year of King Cyrus, Cyrus the King issued a decree that this house of God should be built.
¹⁴ And the vessels of the house of God, the golden and the silver, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth from the house in Jerusalem and had carried away into the king's temple, these Cyrus the King brought forth from the king's temple and gave them to Sheshbazzar, the treasurer, him who was over the treasury, and said unto him:
¹⁵ "Take all the vessels, and go, set them in the house which is in Jerusalem, in their appointed place."
¹⁶ Then that Sheshbazzar came, and laid the foundations of the house of God in Jerusalem; and from that time until now it hath been building, yet is it not completed.
¹⁷ Now therefore, if it seem good unto the king, let search be made in the king's treasure house of Babylon, that thou mayest know that from King Cyrus a decree was given to build that house of God which is in Jerusalem; and when the king shall know of this matter, let him send [word] unto us.

**CHAPTER 6.**

¹ Then Darius the king issued a decree, and he made search in the archives, where the treasure house was kept in Babylon.
² And there was found in Achmetha, in the city, in the fortress, one scroll, and this was written therein as a memorandum:
³ "In the first year of King Cyrus, Cyrus the king gave a decree concerning the house of God which is in Jerusalem: Let the house be built, even a place where they offer sacrifices. And its height was set to be sixty cubits, and its width sixty cubits.
⁴ And there shall be three courses of strong stones, and one course of timber; and the expense shall be defrayed from the king's house.
⁵ And the vessels of the house of God, the silver and the golden, which Nebuchadnezzar brought forth from the house in Jerusalem and carried away unto Babylon, let them be restored and return unto the temple which is in Jerusalem, even unto the place where they were deposited in the house of God.
⁶ Now therefore, ye governors beyond the river,
