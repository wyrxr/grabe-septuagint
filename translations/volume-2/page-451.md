ποιήσει, καὶ κρίμα πτωχῶν δώσει. Οὐκ ἀφελεῖ ἀπὸ δικαίου ὀφθαλ-  7
μῶν αὐτοῦ, καὶ μετὰ βασιλέων εἰς θρόνον καθιεῖ αὐτοὺς (καὶ)
εἰς νίκος, καὶ ὑψωθήσονται. Καὶ εἰ πεπεδημένοι ἐν χειροπέδαις,  8
συσχεθήσονται ἐν σχοινίοις πενίας· καὶ ἀναγγελεῖ αὐτοῖς τὰ ἔρ-  9
γα αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰ παραπτώματα αὐτῶν, ὅταν ἰσχύσωσιν. Ἀλλὰ  10
τοῦ δικαίου εἰσακούσεται· καὶ εἶπεν, ὅτι ἐπιστραφήσονται ἐξ ἀδι-
κίας. Ἐὰν ἀκούσωσι καὶ δουλεύσωσι, συντελέσουσι τὰς ἡμέρας  11
αὐτῶν ἐν ἀγαθοῖς, καὶ τὰ ἔτη αὐτῶν ἐν εὐπρεπείαις. Ἀσθεβεῖς  12
δὲ οὐ διασώζει, παρὰ τὸ μὴ βούλεσθαι αὐτοὺς εἰδέναι τὸν Κύριον,
καὶ διότι νουθετούμενοι ἀνήκοοι ἦσαν. Καὶ ὑποκριταὶ καρδίᾳ τά-  13
ξουσι θυμόν· οὐ βοηθήσονται, ὅτι ἔδησεν αὐτούς. Ἀποθάνῃ τοίνυν ἐν  14
νεότητι ἡ ψυχὴ αὐτῶν, ἡ δὲ ζωὴ αὐτῶν τιτρωσκομένη εἴη ὑπὸ
ἀγγέλων· ἀνθ᾿ ὧν ἔθλιψαν ἀσθενῆ καὶ ἀδύνατον. Κρίμα δὲ πραέων  15
ἐκβήσει· καὶ προσέτι ἠπάτησέ σε ἐκ στόματος ἐχθροῦ, (ἄβυσσος  16
κατάχυσις ὑποκάτω αὐτῆς,) καὶ κατέβη τράπεζά σου πλήρης
πιότητος. Καὶ οὐχ ὑστερήσει ἀπὸ δικαίων· κρίμα· θυμὸς δὲ ἐπ᾿ 17.18
ἀσεβεῖς ἔσται, διὰ ἀσέβειαν δώρων ὧν ἐδέζοντο ἐπ᾿ ἀδικίαις. Μὴ  19
σε ἐκκλίνῃ ὁ νοῦς ἔχων δεήσεως ἀδυνάτων ἐν ἀνάγκῃ ὄντων· καὶ
πάντας τοὺς κραταιοῦντας ἰσχύϊ μὴ ἐξελκύσῃς τὴν νύκτα, τοῦ  20
ἀναβῆναι λαοὺς ἀντ᾿ αὐτῶν. Ἀλλὰ φύλαξαι μὴ πράξῃς ἄνομα·  21
ἐπὶ τοῦτο γὰρ ἐξείλω ἀπὸ πτωχείας. Ἰδοὺ, ὁ ἰσχυρὸς κραταιώ-  22
σει (σε) ἐν ἰσχύϊ αὐτοῦ· τίς γάρ ἐστι κατ᾿ αὐτὸν δυνάστης; Τίς  23
δὲ ἐστιν ὁ ἐτάζων αὐτοῦ τὰ ἔργα; ἢ τίς ὁ εἰπών· ἔπραξεν ἀδι-  24
κα; Μνήσθητι (οὖν Ἰὼβ), ὅτι μεγάλα αὐτοῦ ἐστι τὰ ἔργα, ὧν  25
ἤρξαν ἄνδρες. Πᾶς ἄνθρωπος ἴδεν ἐν ἑαυτῷ, ὅσοι τιτρωσκόμενοί  26
εἰσι βροτοί. Ἰδοὺ, ὁ ἰσχυρὸς πολὺς, καὶ οὐ γνωσόμεθα ἀριθ-  27
μὸς ἐτῶν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀπέραντος. Ἀριθμηταὶ δὲ αὐτῷ ὑετοῦ σα-  28
γόνες· καὶ ἐπιχυθήσονται ὑετῷ εἰς νεφέλην· ῥυήσονται παλαιώ-  29
ματα, ἐσκίασε δὲ νέφη ἐπὶ ἀμυθήτῳ βροτῷ. Ὥραν ἔθετο κτή-  30
νεσιν, καὶ οἴδασι κοίτης τάξιν. Ἐπὶ τούτοις πᾶσιν οὐκ ἐξίξατό  31
σου ἡ διάνοια; οὐδὲ διαλλάσσεταί σου ἡ καρδία ἀπὸ τοῦ σώμα-  32
τος; Καὶ ἐὰν συνῆι ἐπεκτάσεις νεφέλης, ἰσότητα σκηνῆς αὐτοῦ·  33
ἰδοὺ ἐκτείνει ἐπ᾿ αὐτὴν ὑετὸν, καὶ ῥιζώματα τῆς θαλάσσης ἐκάλυψεν.
Ἐν γὰρ αὐτοῖς κρινεῖ λαούς· δώσει τροφὴν τῷ ἰσχύοντι. 34
Ἐπὶ χειρῶν ἐκάλυψε φῶς, καὶ ἐνετείλατο περὶ αὐτῆς ἐν ἀπαντῶντι· 35
ἀναγγελεῖ περὶ αὐτοῦ φίλῳ αὐτοῦ (Κυρίου) κτήσεις, καὶ περὶ 36

## CHAPTER XXXVI.

**6** "...He shall not preserve alive the ungodly,"
**7** but shall do [judgment], and judgment shall He give unto the poor. He shall not withdraw His eyes from the righteous, but with kings shall He seat them upon a throne (and) unto victory, and they shall be exalted.
**8** And if they be bound in fetters, they shall be held fast in cords of poverty;
**9** and He shall declare unto them their works, and their transgressions, when they prevail.
**10** But He shall hearken unto the righteous; and He hath said that they shall turn from unrighteousness.
**11** If they hearken and serve Him, they shall complete their days in good things, and their years in proprieties.
**12** But the weak He saveth not, because they would not know the Lord, and because, being admonished, they were disobedient.
**13** And hypocrites in heart shall set up wrath; they shall not be helped, for He hath bound them.
**14** Therefore let their soul die in youth, and let their life be wounded by angels; for which cause they afflicted the weak and the helpless.
**15** But the judgment of the meek shall go forth;
**16** and moreover, He hath deceived thee from the mouth of the enemy, (a deep abyss of pouring out beneath it,) and thy table came down full of fatness.
**17** And He shall not fall short of the righteous; [it is] judgment;
**18** but wrath shall be upon the impious, because of the impiety of gifts which they received for unrighteous deeds.
**19** Let not thy mind turn aside, having the supplication of the helpless who are in necessity;
**20** and all those who make themselves strong by might, do not drag [them] out in the night, for the purpose of peoples to rise up in their stead.
**21** But beware lest thou do lawless deeds; for to this end thou wert delivered from poverty.
**22** Behold, the Mighty One shall strengthen [thee] by His might; for who is a ruler like unto Him?
**23** And who is he that examineth His works?
**24** Or who is he that hath said, 'He hath done unrighteous deeds?'
**25** Remember (therefore, O Job), that His works are great, the beginning of which men have beheld.
**26** Every man hath seen in himself, how many mortals are wounded.
**27** Behold, the Mighty One is manifold, and we shall not know the number of His years, and [it is] boundless.
**28** And unto Him are counted the showers of rain;
**29** and they shall be poured out with rain into the cloud; the ancient rains shall flow, and the clouds have cast shade upon untold rain.
**30** He hath set a season for the cattle, and they know the order of their resting place.
**31** In all these things hath not thy mind comprehended?
**32** Nor is thy heart transformed from thy body?
**33** And if thou understand the extensions of a cloud, the evenness of His tabernacle; behold, He stretcheth out upon it rain, and hath covered the roots of the sea.
**34** For in these He shall judge peoples; He shall give food to the mighty one.
**35** He hath covered light in His hands, and commanded concerning it in meeting;
**36** He shall declare concerning Him to His friend (the Lord's) possessions, and concerning
