Καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ πονηρὸν ἐναντίον Κυρίου κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίη-
σαν οἱ πατέρες αὐτοῦ. ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις αὐτοῦ ἦλθε Ναβουχοδονό-
σορ βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος εἰς τὴν γῆν, καὶ ἦν αὐτῷ δουλεύων τρία
ἔτη, καὶ ἀπέστη ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ. καὶ ἀπέστειλε Κύριος ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς τοὺς
Χαλδαίους, καὶ ληστήρια Σύρων, καὶ ληστήρια Μωαβιτῶν, καὶ
υἱῶν ᾿Αμμών, καὶ τῆς Σαμαρείας, καὶ ἀπέστησαν μετὰ τὸν λόγον
τοῦτον κατὰ τὸν λόγον Κυρίου ἐν χειρὶ τῶν παίδων αὐτοῦ τῶν
προφητῶν. πλὴν θυμὸς Κυρίου ἦν ἐπὶ ᾿Ιούδαν τοῦ ἀποστῆσαι αὐ-
τὸν ἀπὸ προσώπου ἑαυτοῦ διὰ τὰς ἁμαρτίας Μανασσῆ ἐν πᾶσιν
οἷς ἐποίησε, καὶ ἐν αἵματι ἀθώῳ ᾧ ἐξέχεεν ᾿Ιωακείμ, καὶ ἔπλησε
6 τὴν ῾Ιερουσαλὴμ αἵματος ἀθώου, καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησε Κύριος ἐξολε-
θρεῦσαι αὐτούς. Καὶ ἀνέβη ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν Ναβουχοδονόσορ βασιλεὺς
Βαβυλῶνος, καὶ ἔδησεν αὐτὸν ἐν χαλκαῖς πέδαις, καὶ ἀνήγαγεν
7 αὐτὸν εἰς Βαβυλῶνα. Καὶ μέρος τῶν σκευῶν οἴκου Κυρίου ἀπ-
ήνεγκεν εἰς Βαβυλῶνα, καὶ ἔθηκεν αὐτὰ ἐν τῷ ναῷ ἑαυτοῦ ἐν Βα-
8 βυλῶνι. Καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων ᾿Ιωακεὶμ καὶ πάντα ἃ ἐποίησεν,
οὐκ ἰδοὺ ταῦτα γεγραμμένα ἐν βιβλίῳ λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν τοῖς
βασιλεῦσιν ᾿Ιούδα; καὶ ἐκοιμήθη ᾿Ιωακεὶμ μετὰ τῶν πατέρων ἑαυ-
τοῦ, καὶ ἐτάφη ἐν Γανοζὰν μετὰ τῶν πατέρων ἑαυτοῦ, καὶ ἐβα-
9 σίλευσεν ᾿Ιεχονίας υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀν᾿ αὐτοῦ. Υἱὸς ὀκτὼ καὶ δέκα
ἐτῶν ᾿Ιεχονίας ἐν τῷ βασιλεύειν αὐτόν, καὶ τρίμηνον καὶ δέκα ἡ-
μέρας ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν ῾Ιερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ πονηρὸν ἐνώπιον
10 Κυρίου. Καὶ ἐπιστραφέντος τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ, ἀπέστειλεν ὁ βασιλεὺς
Ναβουχοδονόσορ, καὶ εἰσήγαγεν αὐτὸν εἰς Βαβυλῶνα μετὰ τῶν
σκευῶν τῶν ἐπιθυμητῶν οἴκου Κυρίου. καὶ ἐβασίλευσε τὸν Σεδε-
11 κίαν ἀδελφὸν τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ ᾿Ιούδαν καὶ ῾Ιερουσαλήμ. Υἱὸς
ἐτῶν εἰκοσιενὸς Σεδεκίας ἐν τῷ βασιλεύειν αὐτόν, καὶ ἔνδεκα ἔτη
12 ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν ῾Ιερουσαλήμ. Καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ πονηρὸν ἐνώπιον Κυ-
ρίου Θεοῦ αὐτοῦ, οὐκ ἐνετράπη ἀπὸ προσώπου ᾿Ιερεμίου τοῦ προ-
13 φήτου καὶ ἐκ στόματος Κυρίου. ᾿Εν τῷ τὰ πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Να-
βουχοδονόσορ ἀθετῆσαι, ἃ ὤρκισεν αὐτὸν κατὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ
ἐσκλήρυνε τὸν τράχηλον αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὴν καρδίαν ἑαυτοῦ κατίσχυ-
14 σε, τοῦ μὴ ἐπιστρέψαι πρὸς Κύριον Θεὸν ᾿Ισραήλ. Καὶ πάντες οἱ
ἔνδοξοι ᾿Ιούδα καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς, καὶ ὁ λαὸς τῆς γῆς ἐπλήθυναν τοῦ
ἀθετῆσαι ἀθετήματα βδελυγμάτων ἐθνῶν, καὶ ἐμίαναν τὸν οἶκον
15 Κυρίου τὸν ἐν ῾Ιερουσαλήμ. Καὶ ἐξαπέστειλε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τῶν

**Chapter 36**

⁵ ...And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his fathers had done.

⁶ In his days came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon into the land; and he was his servant three years, and then rebelled against him. And the Lord sent against them the Chaldeans, and bands of Syrians, and bands of Moabites, and of the children of Ammon, and of Samaria; and they turned away after this word, according to the word of the Lord by the hand of His servants the prophets. Nevertheless, the wrath of the Lord was upon Judah, to cast them away from His presence, because of all the sins of Manasseh which he had done, and because of the innocent blood which Jehoiakim had shed; for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, and the Lord willed not to utterly destroy them.

⁷ And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against him, and bound him in brazen fetters, and carried him away to Babylon.

⁸ And a part of the vessels of the house of the Lord he carried away to Babylon, and he put them in his temple in Babylon. Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, behold, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And Jehoiakim slept with his fathers, and was buried in Ganozan with his fathers; and Jeconiah his son reigned in his stead.

⁹ Jeconiah was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem; and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord.

¹⁰ And when the year was returned, King Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the precious vessels of the house of the Lord; and he made Zedekiah his father's brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.

¹¹ Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.

¹² And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord his God, and humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet, nor before the word from the mouth of the Lord.

¹³ Moreover, he dealt faithlessly with King Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God; and he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from turning unto the Lord God of Israel.

¹⁴ And all the nobles of Judah, and the priests, and the people of the land, multiplied their transgressions after all the abominations of the nations, and defiled the house of the Lord which was in Jerusalem.
