ΚΕΦ. ΙΘʹ.
5 μήθῃ, καὶ ὕπνωσεν ἐκεῖ ὑπὸ φυτόν. Καὶ ἰδοὺ τις ἥψατο αὐτοῦ, καὶ
6 εἶπεν αὐτῷ· ἀνάστηθι, φάγε. Καὶ ἐπέβλεψεν Ἠλιοὺ· καὶ ἰδοὺ πρὸς
κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ ἐγκρυφίας ὀλυρίτης, καὶ καψάκης ὕδατος. Καὶ ἀνέστη,
7 καὶ ἔφαγε, καὶ ἔπιε, καὶ ἐπιστρέψας ἐκοιμήθη. Καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν ὁ
8 ἄγγελος Κυρίου ἐκ δευτέρου, καὶ ἥψατο αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ·
ἀνάστηθι, φάγε, ὅτι πολλὴ ἀπὸ σοῦ ἡ ὁδός. Καὶ ἀνέστη,
9 καὶ ἔφαγε, καὶ ἔπιε, καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἐν τῇ ἰσχύϊ τῆς βρώσεως ἐκείνης
τεσσαράκοντα ἡμέρας, καὶ τεσσαράκοντα νύκτας, ἕως
10 ὄρους τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ Χωρήβ. Καὶ εἰσῆλθεν ἐκεῖ εἰς τὸ σπήλαιον,
καὶ κατέλυσεν ἐκεῖ, καὶ ἰδοὺ ῥῆμα Κυρίου πρὸς αὐτόν, καὶ εἶπε·
11 τί σὺ ἐνταῦθα, Ἠλιού; Καὶ εἶπεν Ἠλιοὺ· Ζηλῶν ἐζήλωσα τῷ Κυρίῳ
παντοκράτορι, ὅτι ἐγκατέλιπόν σε οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ, τὰ θυσιαστήριά
σου κατέσκαψαν, καὶ τοὺς προφήτας σου ἀπέκτειναν ἐν
12 ῥομφαίᾳ, καὶ ὑπολέλειμμαι ἐγὼ μονώτατος, καὶ ζητοῦσι τὴν ψυχήν
μου λαβεῖν αὐτήν. Καὶ εἶπεν· ἐξελεύσῃ αὔριον, καὶ στήσῃ
13 ἐν τῷ ὄρει ἐνώπιον Κυρίου· καὶ ἰδοὺ Κύριος παρελεύσεται, καὶ
πνεῦμα μέγα κραταιὸν διαλῦον ὄρη, καὶ συντρίβον πέτρας ἐνώπιον
14 Κυρίου, οὐκ ἐν τῷ πνεύματι Κύριος· καὶ μετὰ τὸ πνεῦμα συσσεισμός,
οὐκ ἐν τῷ συσσεισμῷ Κύριος. Καὶ μετὰ τὸν συσσεισμὸν
15 πῦρ, οὐκ ἐν τῷ πυρὶ Κύριος· καὶ μετὰ τὸ πῦρ φωνὴ αὔρας λεπτῆς,
16 κἀκεῖ Κύριος. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἤκουσεν Ἠλιοὺ, καὶ ἐπεκάλυψε τὸ
πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ μηλωτῇ ἑαυτοῦ, καὶ ἐξῆλθε,
17 καὶ ἔστη ὑπὸ τὸ σπήλαιον· καὶ ἰδοὺ πρὸς αὐτὸν φωνή, καὶ εἶπε·
18 τί σὺ ἐνταῦθα Ἠλιού; Καὶ εἶπεν Ἠλιοὺ· Ζηλῶν ἐζήλωσα τῷ Κυρίῳ
παντοκράτορι, ὅτι ἐγκατέλιπον τὴν διαθήκην σου οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ·
τὰ θυσιαστήριά σου καθεῖλαν, καὶ τοὺς προφήτας σου ἀπέκτειναν ἐν
19 ῥομφαίᾳ, καὶ ὑπολέλειμμαι ἐγὼ μονώτατος, καὶ ζητοῦσι τὴν ψυχήν
20 μου λαβεῖν αὐτήν. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς αὐτόν· πορεύου, ἀνάστρεφε
εἰς τὴν ὁδόν σου, καὶ ἥξεις εἰς τὴν ὁδὸν ἐρήμου Δαμασκοῦ·
21 καὶ ἥξεις, καὶ χρίσεις (ἐκεῖ) τὸν Ἀζαὴλ εἰς βασιλέα τῆς Συρίας,
22 καὶ τὸν Ἰηοῦ υἱὸν Ναμεσσὶ χρίσεις εἰς βασιλέα ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ·
23 καὶ τὸν Ἐλισσαιὲ υἱὸν Σαφὰτ ἀπὸ Ἀβελμαουλὰ χρίσεις εἰς προφήτην
24 ἀντὶ σοῦ. Καὶ ἔσται τὸν σωζόμενον ἐκ ῥομφαίας Ἀζαὴλ θανατώσει
Ἰηοῦ· καὶ τὸν σωζόμενον ἐκ ῥομφαίας Ἰηοῦ θανατώσει Ἐλισσαιέ.
25 Καὶ καταλείψεις ἐν Ἰσραὴλ ἑπτὰ χιλιάδας ἀνδρῶν, πάντα γόνατα ἃ
οὐκ ἔκλασαν τῷ Βάαλ,

**Chapter 19**

**5** —and he slumbered there beneath a plant. And behold, someone touched him, and
**6** said unto him, "Arise, [and] eat." And Elijah looked; and behold, at his head was a cake baked upon the coals, [made] of spelt, and a cruse of water. And he arose,
**7** and ate, and drank, and turning back, he slept. And the
**8** angel of the LORD returned a second time, and touched him, and said unto him, "Arise, [and] eat; for the journey is long for thee." And he arose,
**9** and ate, and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights, even unto
**10** the mountain of God, Horeb. And he came thither unto the cave, and abode there. And behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, and said,
**11** "What art thou doing here, Elijah?" And Elijah said, "With zeal have I been zealous for the Lord Almighty, because the children of Israel have forsaken Thee; they have cast down Thy altars, and Thy
**12** prophets have they slain with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life to take it away." And He said, "Go forth tomorrow, and stand
**13** upon the mount before the LORD. And behold, the LORD will pass by, and a great and mighty wind, tearing the mountains and breaking in pieces the rocks before
**14** the LORD; [but] the LORD was not in the wind. And after the wind, an earthquake; [but] the LORD was not in the earthquake. And after the earthquake, a
**15** fire; [but] the LORD was not in the fire. And after the fire, a sound of a gentle breeze,
**16** and there was the LORD. And it came to pass, when Elijah heard [it], that he covered his face with his mantle, and went out,
**17** and stood under the cave. And behold, a voice [came] unto him, and said,
**18** "What art thou doing here, Elijah?" And Elijah said, "With zeal have I been zealous for the Lord Almighty, because the children of Israel have forsaken Thy covenant; they have torn down Thy altars, and Thy prophets have they slain with
**19** the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life to take it away."
**20** And the LORD said unto him, "Go, return on thy way to the wilderness way of Damascus;
**21** and thou shalt come, and anoint Hazael (there) to be king over Syria,
**22** and Jehu, the son of Nimshi, shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel;
**23** and Elisha, the son of Shaphat, of Abel-meholah, shalt thou anoint to be a prophet
**24** in thy stead. And it shall come to pass, that him who escapeth from the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay; and him who escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay.
**25** And thou shalt leave seven thousand in Israel, even all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal,
