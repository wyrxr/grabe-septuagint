ἀπολέσαι ὁλοριζί, ταῖς τῶν ἐχθρῶν μαχαίραις ἄνευ παντὸς οἴκτου
καὶ φειδοῦς, τῇ τεσσαρεσκαιδεκάτῃ τοῦ δωδεκάτου μηνὸς Ἀδὰρ,
τοῦ ἐνεστῶτος ἔτους, ὅπως οἱ πάλαι καὶ νῦν δυσμενεῖς ἐν ἡμέρᾳ
μιᾷ βιαίως εἰς τὸν ᾅδην κατελθόντες, εἰς τὸν μετέπειτα χρόνον
εὐσταθῆ καὶ ἀτάραχα παρέχωσιν ἡμῖν διὰ τέλους τὰ πράγματα.
14 Τὰ δὲ ἀντίγραφα τῶν ἐπιστολῶν ἐξετίθετο κατὰ χώραν· καὶ προσετάχθη
τοῖς ἔθνεσι πᾶσιν ἑτοίμους εἶναι, εἰς τὴν ἡμέραν ταύτην.
15 Ἐσπεύδετο δὲ τὸ πρᾶγμα, καὶ ἐν Σούσοις· ὁ δὲ βασιλεὺς καὶ
Ἀμὰν ἐκωθωνίζοντο· ἐταράσσετο δὲ ἡ πόλις.

                                ΚΕΦ. Δ΄. IV.

1    Ὁ δὲ Μαρδοχαῖος ἐπιγνοὺς τὸ συντελούμενον, διέρρηξε τὰ ἱμά-
     τια αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐνεδύσατο σάκκον, καὶ κατεπάσατο σποδὸν· καὶ
     ἐκπηδήσας διὰ τῆς πλατείας τῆς πόλεως, ἐβόα φωνῇ μεγάλῃ· αἴρεται
     ἔθνος μηδὲν ἠδικηκός. Καὶ ἦλθεν ἕως τῆς πύλης τοῦ βα-
2    σιλέως, καὶ ἔστη· οὐ γὰρ ἦν αὐτῷ ἐξὸν εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὴν αὐλήν,
     σάκκον ἔχοντα καὶ σποδόν.
3    Καὶ ἐν πάσῃ χώρᾳ οὗ ἐξετίθετο τὰ
     γράμματα, κραυγὴ καὶ κοπετὸς ἦν καὶ πένθος μέγα τοῖς Ἰου-
     δαίοις, καὶ σάκκον καὶ σποδὸν ἔστρωσαν ἑαυτοῖς.
4    Καὶ εἰσῆλ-
     θον αἱ ἄβραι καὶ οἱ εὐνοῦχοι τῆς βασιλίσσης, καὶ ἀνήγγειλαν αὐ-
     τῇ· καὶ ἐταράχθη ἀκούσασα τὸ γεγονὸς· καὶ ἀπέστειλε στολίσαι
     τὸν Μαρδοχαῖον, καὶ ἀφελέσθαι αὐτοῦ τὸν σάκκον. ὁ δὲ οὐκ ἐπεί-
     σθη.
5    Ἡ δὲ Ἐσθὴρ προσεκαλέσατο Ἀγραβαῖον τὸν εὐνοῦχον αὐ-
     τῆς, ὃς παρειστήκει αὐτῇ, καὶ ἀπέστειλε μαθεῖν αὐτὸν παρὰ τοῦ
     Μαρδοχαίου τὸ ἀκριβές. (ἐπὶ τὴν πλατεῖαν πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα.)
6    Ὁ δὲ Μαρδοχαῖος ὑπέδειξεν αὐτῷ τὸ γεγονὸς, καὶ τὴν ἐπαγγε-
     λίαν ἣν ἀπηγγείλατο Ἀμὰν τῷ βασιλεῖ εἰς γάζαν ταλάντων μυ-
8    ρίων, ἵνα ἀπολέσῃ τοὺς Ἰουδαίους. Καὶ τὸ ἀντίγραφον τὸ ἐν Σού-
     σοις ἐκτεθὲν ὑπὲρ τοῦ ἀπολέσθαι αὐτοὺς ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ δεῖξαι τῇ
     Ἐσθὴρ· καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ, ἐντείλασθαι αὐτῇ εἰσελθοῦσαν παραιτή-
     σασθαι τὸν βασιλέα, καὶ ἀξιῶσαι αὐτὸν περὶ τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ τῆς πα-
     τρίδος, μνησθεῖσα ἡμερῶν ταπεινώσεώς σου, ὡς ἐτράφης ἐν χειρί
     μου, διότι Ἀμὰν ὁ δευτερεύων τῷ βασιλεῖ ἐλάλησε καθ’ ἡμῶν εἰς
     θάνατον· ἐπικαλέσαι τὸν Κύριον, καὶ λάλησον τῷ βασιλεῖ περὶ
     ἡμῶν, καὶ ῥῦσαι ἡμᾶς ἐκ θανάτου.
9    Εἰσελθὼν δὲ ὁ Ἀγραβαῖος

...to utterly destroy [them], root and branch, with the swords of their enemies, without any pity or sparing, on the fourteenth day of the twelfth month, even Adar, of the present year; so that those who are hostile, both of old and now, having violently descended into Hades in one day, may render our affairs stable and undisturbed perpetually in the time to come.
<sup>14</sup> And the copies of the letters were published throughout every province; and it was commanded unto all the nations to be ready against that day.
<sup>15</sup> And the matter was hastened, even in Susa; and the king and Haman caroused, but the city was in perplexity.

#### CHAPTER IV

<sup>1</sup> Now when Mordecai knew all that was done, he rent his garments, and put on sackcloth, and sprinkled himself with ashes; and he rushed forth through the broad place of the city, and cried with a loud voice, saying, "A nation that hath done no wrong is being taken away [to destruction]!"
<sup>2</sup> And he came even unto the king's gate, and stood there; for it was not lawful for him to enter into the court, being clothed in sackcloth and ashes.
<sup>3</sup> And in every province where the letters were published, there was great wailing and lamentation and mourning among the Jews, and they spread sackcloth and ashes for themselves.
<sup>4</sup> Then came the queen's chambermaids and her eunuchs, and told her thereof; and the queen was exceedingly troubled when she heard what was done; and she sent [garments] to clothe Mordecai, and to take his sackcloth from him: but he received them not.
<sup>5</sup> Then Esther called for Agrabaios, her eunuch, who stood by her, and she sent him to learn of Mordecai the exact truth [of the matter]. (He was in the broad place before the king.)
<sup>6</sup> And Mordecai showed him all that had befallen, and the promise which Haman had made unto the king concerning the treasury of ten thousand talents, that he might utterly destroy the Jews.
<sup>8</sup> And he gave him the copy of the writing that was published in Susa for their destruction, to show it unto Esther; and he charged him to command her, that she should go in and make humble supplication unto the king, and beseech him for her people and for her country, remembering the days of thy humiliation, how thou wast nourished by my hand, because Haman, who is second to the king, hath spoken against us unto death. [And he said to him:] "Call upon the Lord, and speak thou unto the king concerning us, and deliver us from death."
<sup>9</sup> And when Agrabaios came in, he spake all these words unto Esther.
