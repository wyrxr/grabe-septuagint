**13** ἔστησαν ἀδελφοί μου, ἔγνωσαν ἀλλοτρίους ἢ ἐμέ· οἱ φίλοι δέ μου
**14** ἀνελεήμονες γεγόνασι, (καὶ) οὐ προσεποιήσαντό με οἱ ἐγγύτατοί
**15** μου, καὶ οἱ εἰδότες μου τὸ ὄνομα ἐπελάθοντό μου· γείτονες οἰκίας,
**16** (θεράποντες) θεράπαιναιί τε μοι, ἀλλογενὴς ἐγενόμην ἐναντίον αὐ-
**17** τῶν· θεράποντά μου (δὲ) ἐκάλεσα, καὶ οὐχ ὑπήκουσέ μου, σῶμα
**18** δέ μου ἐδέετο αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἱκέτευον τὴν γυναῖκά μου, καὶ προσ-
**19** εκαλούμην κολακεύων υἱοὺς παλλακίδων μου· οἱ δὲ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνά
**20** μέ ἀπεποιήσαντο, ὅταν ἀναστῶ, κατ᾿ ἐμοῦ λαλοῦσιν. Ἐβδελύξαν-
**21** τό (δὲ) μέ οἱ εἰδότες με· καὶ οὓς ἠγάπων, ἐπανέστησάν μοι. Ἐν
    δέρματί μου ἐσάπησαν σάρκες μου, τὰ δὲ ὀσᾶ μου ἐν ὀδοῦσιν ἔχε-
**22** ται. (Ἐγγίσατέ μοι), ἐλεήσατέ με, ὦ φίλοι, ἐλεήσατέ με· χεὶρ
    γὰρ Κυρίου ἐστὶν ἡ ἁψαμένη μου. Διατί δέ με διώκετε ὥσπερ καὶ
**23** ὁ Κύριος; ἀπὸ δὲ σαρκῶν μου οὐκ ἐμπίπλασθε. Τίς γὰρ ἂν δώῃ
    γραφῆναι τὰ ῥήματά μου, τεθῆναι δὲ αὐτὰ ἐν βιβλίῳ εἰς τὸν αἰῶ-
**24** να, ἐν γραφείῳ σιδηρῷ καὶ μολίβῳ, ἢ ἐν πέτραις ἐγγλυφῆναι εἰς
**25** μαρτύριον; Οἶδα γὰρ ὅτι ἀένναός ἐστιν ὁ ἐκλύειν με μέλλων ἐπὶ
**26** γῆς· ἀναστήσει δέ μου τὸ δέρμα τὸ ἀναντλοῦν ταῦτα. Παρὰ γὰρ
**27** Κυρίου μοι ταῦτα συνετελέσθη, ἃ ἐγὼ ἐμαυτῷ συνεπίσταμαι, ἃ οἱ
    ὀφθαλμοί μου ἑωράκασι, καὶ οὐχ ἄλλο· πάντα δέ μοι συνετελέ-
**28** σται ἐν κόλπῳ. Εἰ δὲ καὶ ἐρεῖτε· τί ἐριοῦμεν ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ; καὶ
**29** ῥίζαν λόγου εὑρήσομεν ἐν αὐτῷ· εὐλαβηθῆτε δὲ καὶ ὑμεῖς ἀπὸ ἐπι-
    καλύμματος. Θυμὸς γὰρ ἐπ᾿ ἀνόμοις ἐπελεύσεται, καὶ τότε γνώ-
    σονται, ποῦ αὐτῶν ἡ ὕλη ἐστίν.

**1** Ὑπολαβὼν δὲ Σωφὰρ ὁ Μιναῖος, λέγει·
**2** οὐχ οὕτως ὑπελαμβανόν (σε εἶναι, καὶ) ἀντερεῖν σε ταῦτα·
**3** καὶ οὐχὶ συνίετε μᾶλλον ἢ ἐγώ. Παιδείαν ἐντροπῆς μου ἀκούσομαι,
**4** καὶ πνεῦμα ἐκ τῆς συνέσεώς μου ἀποκρίνεται μοι. Μὴ ταῦτα ἔγνως
**5** ἀπὸ τοῦ ἔτι, ἀφ᾿ οὗ ἐτέθη ἄνθρωπος ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς; Εὐφροσύνη γὰρ ἀσεβῶν πτῶ-
**6** μα ἐξαίσιον, χαρμονὴ δὲ παρανόμων ἀπώλεια. Ἐὰν ἀναβῇ εἰς
**7** οὐρανὸν τὰ δῶρα αὐτοῦ, ἢ δὲ θυσία αὐτοῦ νεφῶν ἅψηται· ὅταν
**8** δοκῇ ἤδη ἐσηρίχθαι, τότε εἰς τέλος ἀπολεῖται· οἱ δὲ ἰδόντες αὐ-
**9** τὸν, ἐροῦσι· ποῦ ἐστιν; Ὥσπερ ἐνύπνιον ἐκπετασθὲν οὐ μὴ εὑρεθῇ,
    ἔπτη δὲ ὥσπερ φάντασμα νυκτερινόν· ὀφθαλμὸς παρέβλεψε,

## CHAPTER XIX.

**13** My brethren have turned away; they have known strangers rather than me.
**14** But my friends have become merciless, (and) my closest [kinsfolk] have not acknowledged me.
**15** And they that knew my name have forgotten me; the neighbors of my house,
**16** (my servants and) my maidservants also [are estranged] from me; I have become a foreigner before them.
**17** I called my servant (yet he hearkened not [unto me]), and my body pleaded with him.
**18** And I entreated my wife,
**19** and called with flattery upon the sons of my concubines; yet they have utterly renounced me for ever.
**20** When I arise, they speak against me. Yea, they that knew me have abhorred me;
**21** and those whom I loved have risen up against me. My flesh is consumed within my skin, and my bones cling to my teeth.
**22** (Draw nigh unto me,) Have pity on me, O friends, have pity on me! For the hand of the Lord it is that hath touched me.
**23** And wherefore do ye pursue me, even as the Lord [doth]? And are ye not sated with my flesh?
**24** Oh, that my words were written! Oh, that they were set down in a book for ever,
**25** with an iron pen and lead, or carved into rocks for a testimony! For I know that Everlasting is He Who is about to loose me upon the earth;
**26** and He shall raise up my skin which endureth these [sufferings].
**27** For these things have been accomplished for me by the Lord, which I myself know well, which mine eyes have seen, and not another; and all things have been accomplished for me within my bosom.
**28** But if ye also shall say, "What shall we say against him?" and, "Shall we find the root of the matter in him?"
**29** Fear ye also from the [Divine] covering. For wrath shall come upon the lawless, and then shall they know where their substance truly is.

## CHAPTER XX.

**1** Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said,
**2** I did not thus suppose (thee to be, and) that thou wouldst gainsay these things;
**3** and do ye not understand more than I? I shall hear the instruction of my shame,
**4** and a spirit from mine understanding doth answer me. Hast thou not known these things from of old,
**5** from the time when man was placed upon the earth? For the joy of the ungodly is a terrible downfall,
**6** and the rejoicing of the lawless is destruction. Though his gifts ascend unto heaven,
**7** or his sacrifice touch the clouds;
**8** when he thinketh himself already established, then shall he utterly perish; and they that have seen him shall say, "Where is he?"
**9** As a dream that is flown away, it shall not be found; yea, it flieth away as a phantom of the night, and an eye hath glanced [at him] but no more.
