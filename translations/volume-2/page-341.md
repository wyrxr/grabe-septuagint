¹⁴ ἀπαρχὰς Κυρίου, καὶ τὰ ἅγια τῶν ἁγίων, διὰ χειρὸς Ὀδδὰμ, καὶ ¹⁵ Βενιαμεὶν, καὶ Ἰησοῦ, καὶ Σεμεὶ, καὶ Ἀμαρίας, καὶ Σεχονίας διὰ χειρὸς τῶν ἱερέων ἐν πίστει, δοῦναι τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς αὐτῶν κατὰ τὰς ἐφημερίας, κατὰ τὸν μέγαν καὶ κατὰ τὸν μικρὸν, ¹⁶ ἐκτὸς τῆς ἐπιγονῆς τῶν ἀρσενικῶν ἀπὸ τριετοῦς καὶ ἐπάνω, παντὶ τῷ εἰσπορευομένῳ εἰς οἶκον Κυρίου, εἰς λόγον ἡμερῶν εἰς ἡμέραν, εἰς λειτουργίαν ἐφημερίας διατάξεως αὐτῶν. ¹⁷ Οὗτος ὁ καταλογισμὸς τῶν ἱερέων κατ᾽ οἴκους πατριῶν· καὶ οἱ Λευῖται ἐν ταῖς ἐφημερίαις αὐτῶν, ἀπὸ εἰκοσαετοῦς καὶ ἐπάνω ἐν διατάξει, ¹⁸ ἐγκαταλογίσαι ἐν πάσῃ ἐπιγονῇ υἱῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ θυγατέρων αὐτῶν εἰς πᾶν τὸ πλῆθος, ὅτι ἐν πίστει ἡγίασαν τὸ ἅγιον. ¹⁹ Τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἀαρὼν τοῖς ἱερατεύουσι, καὶ οἱ ἀπὸ τῶν πόλεων αὐτῶν ἐν πάσῃ πόλει καὶ πόλει, ἄνδρες οἱ ὠνομάσθησαν ἐν ὀνόματι, δοῦναι μερίδα παντὶ ἀρσενικῷ ἐν τοῖς ἱερεῦσι, καὶ παντὶ καταριθμουμένῳ ἐν τοῖς Λευίταις. ²⁰ Καὶ ἐποίησεν οὕτως Ἑζεκίας ἐν παντὶ Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ καλὸν καὶ τὸ εὐθὲς ἐναντίον Κυρίου Θεοῦ αὐτοῦ. ²¹ Καὶ ἐν παντὶ ἔργῳ ἐν ᾧ ἤρξατο ἐν ἐργασίᾳ ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου, καὶ ἐν τῷ νόμῳ καὶ ἐν τοῖς προστάγμασιν ἐξεζήτησε τὸν Θεὸν ἑαυτοῦ, ἐξ ὅλης τῆς ψυχῆς αὐτοῦ ἐποίησε, καὶ εὐοδώθη.

ΚΕΦ. ΛΒ΄.
¹ ΚΑΙ μετὰ τοὺς λόγους τούτους καὶ τὴν ἀλήθειαν ταύτην, ἦλθε Σενναχηρεὶμ βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων, καὶ ἦλθεν ἐπὶ Ἰούδαν, καὶ παρενέβαλεν ἐπὶ τὰς πόλεις τὰς τειχήρεις, καὶ εἶπε προκαταλαβέσθαι αὐτάς. ² Καὶ εἶδεν Ἑζεκίας ὅτι ἥκει Σενναχηρεὶμ, καὶ τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ τοῦ πολεμῆσαι ἐπὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ. ³ Καὶ ἐβουλεύσατο μετὰ τῶν πρεσβυτέρων ἑαυτοῦ καὶ δυνατῶν, ἐμφράξαι τὰ ὕδατα τῶν πηγῶν ἃ ἦν ἔξω τῆς πόλεως· καὶ συνεπίσχυσαν αὐτῷ. ⁴ Καὶ συνήγαγε λαὸν πολὺν, καὶ ἐνέφραξε τὰ ὕδατα τῶν πηγῶν, καὶ τὸν ποταμὸν τὸν διορίζοντα διὰ τῆς πόλεως, λέγων· μὴ ἔλθῃ ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἀσσοὺρ, καὶ εὕρῃ ὕδωρ πολὺ, καὶ κατισχύσῃ. ⁵ Καὶ κατίσχυσεν Ἑζεκίας, καὶ ᾠκοδόμησε πᾶν τὸ τεῖχος τὸ κατεσκαμμένον, καὶ πύργους, καὶ ἔξω προτείχισμα ἄλλο, καὶ κατίσχυσε τὸ ἀνάλημμα πόλεως Δαυίδ, καὶ κατεσκεύασεν ὅπλα πολλά. ⁶ Καὶ ἔθετο ἄρχοντας τοῦ πολέμου ἐπὶ τὸν λαὸν, καὶ συνήχθησαν πρὸς αὐτὸν

### Chapter 31

¹⁴...the offerings of the Lord, and the holiest of holy things, by the hand of Oddam, and ¹⁵ Benjamin, and Jesus, and Shemei, and Amariah, and Shecaniah; by the hand of the priests, in faithfulness, to give unto their brethren according to their courses, unto the great and unto the small; ¹⁶ apart from the male offspring from three years old and upward, [it was given] to every one entering into the house of the Lord, for a daily portion, for the service of their appointed course.

¹⁷ This was the registration of the priests according to the houses of their fathers; and the Levites in their courses, from twenty years old and upward, in [due] order, ¹⁸ to be enrolled among all the offspring of their sons and of their daughters, unto all the multitude, for in faithfulness they consecrated the holy thing.

¹⁹ Unto the sons of Aaron, who ministered as priests, and to those from their cities, in every city and city—even men who were called by name—was given a portion to every male among the priests, and to every one numbered among the Levites.

²⁰ And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah; yea, he did that which was good and right before the Lord his God. ²¹ And in every work which he undertook in the service of the house of the Lord, and in the Law and in the commandments, he sought his God; with his whole soul he did it, and prospered.

### Chapter 32

¹ NOW after these deeds and this faithfulness, Sennacherib king of the Assyrians came, and he came upon Judah, and encamped against the fortified cities, and said that he would take them by force.

² And Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come, and that his face was set to war against Jerusalem. ³ And he consulted with his elders and his mighty men to stop up the waters of the springs which were outside the city; and they rendered him strong assistance. ⁴ And he gathered a great many people, and they stopped up the waters of the springs, and the river that ran through the midst of the city, saying, "Lest the king of Asshur come and find much water, and become mighty [by it]."

⁵ And Hezekiah strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken down, and towers, and outside [he built] another outer wall; and he strengthened the Millo of the city of David, and made many weapons. ⁶ And he set captains of war over the people, and they were gathered together unto him,
