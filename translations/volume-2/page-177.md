τοῦ ἀμπελῶνος τούτου, καὶ ἔσται μοι εἰς κῆπον λαχάνων.
3 Καὶ εἶπε Ναβουθαὶ πρὸς Ἀχαάβ· μὴ γένοιτό μοι παρὰ Θεοῦ μου δοῦναι κληρονομίαν πατέρων μου σοι.
4 Καὶ ἦλθεν Ἀχαὰβ πρὸς οἶκον αὐτοῦ, συγκεχυμένος καὶ ἐκλελυμένος ἐπὶ τῷ λόγῳ, ὡς ἐλάλησε πρὸς αὐτὸν Ναβουθαὶ ὁ Ἰεζραηλίτης, καὶ εἶπεν· οὐ δώσω σοι κληρονομίαν πατέρων, καὶ ἐκοιμήθη ἐπὶ τῆς κλίνης αὐτοῦ, καὶ συνεκαλύψε τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἔφαγεν ἄρτον.
5 Καὶ εἰσῆλθε πρὸς αὐτὸν Ἰεζάβελ ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐλάλησε πρὸς αὐτόν· τί τὸ πνεῦμά σου τεταραγμένον, καὶ οὐκ εἶ σὺ ἐσθίων ἄρτον;
6 Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτήν· ὅτι ἐλάλησα πρὸς Ναβουθαὶ τὸν Ἰεζραηλίτην, λέγων· δός μοι τὸν ἀμπελῶνά σου ἀργυρίου· εἰ δὲ βούλῃ, δώσω σοι ἀμπελῶνα ἄλλον ἀντὶ τούτου, καὶ εἶπεν· οὐ δώσω σοι κληρονομίαν πατέρων μου.
7 Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτὸν Ἰεζάβελ ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ· σὺ νῦν οὕτως ποιεῖς βασιλείαν ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ; ἀνάστηθι, φάγε ἄρτον, καὶ σαυτοῦ γενοῦ· ἐγὼ δώσω σοι τὸν ἀμπελῶνα Ναβουθαὶ τοῦ Ἰεζραηλίτου.
8 Καὶ ἔγραψε βιβλίον ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι Ἀχαάβ, καὶ ἐσφραγίσατο τῇ σφραγῖδι αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀπέστειλε τὸ βιβλίον πρὸς τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους, πρὸς τοὺς ἐλευθέρους, οἱ ἐν τῇ πόλει αὐτοῦ, τοὺς κατοικοῦντας μετὰ Ναβουθαί·
9 καὶ ἐγέγραπτο ἐν τοῖς βιβλίοις, λέγων· νηστεύσατε νηστείαν, καὶ καθίσατε τὸν Ναβουθαὶ ἐν ἀρχῇ τοῦ λαοῦ·
10 καὶ καθίσατε δύο ἄνδρας υἱοὺς παρανόμων ἐξεναντίας αὐτοῦ, καὶ καταμαρτυρησάτωσαν αὐτοῦ, λέγοντες· Ἠυλόγησε Θεόν, καὶ βασιλέα· καὶ ἐξαγαγέτωσαν αὐτὸν καὶ λιθοβολήσατωσαν αὐτόν, καὶ ἀποθανέτω.
11 Καὶ ἐποίησαν οἱ ἄνδρες πόλεως αὐτοῦ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι, καὶ οἱ ἐλεύθεροι οἱ καθήμενοι ἐν πόλει αὐτοῦ, καθὰ ἀπέστειλε πρὸς αὐτοὺς Ἰεζάβελ, καθὰ γέγραπται ἐν τοῖς βιβλίοις οἷς ἀπέστειλε πρὸς αὐτούς.
12 Ἐκάλεσαν νηστείαν, καὶ ἐκάθισαν τὸν Ναβουθαὶ ἐν κεφαλῇ τοῦ λαοῦ.
13 Καὶ ἦλθον δύο ἄνδρες οἱ υἱοὶ παρανόμων, καὶ ἐκάθισαν ἐξεναντίας αὐτοῦ, καὶ κατεμαρτύρησαν ἄνδρες τῆς ἀποστασίας τοῦ Ναβουθαὶ κατέναντι τοῦ λαοῦ, λέγοντες· Ἠυλόγησε Ναβουθαὶ Θεὸν καὶ βασιλέα· καὶ ἐξήγαγον αὐτὸν ἔξω τῆς πόλεως, καὶ ἐλιθοβόλησαν αὐτὸν ἐν λίθοις, καὶ ἀπέθανε.
14 Καὶ ἀπέστειλαν πρὸς Ἰεζάβελ, λέγοντες· λελιθοβόληται Ναβουθαί, καὶ τέθνηκε.
15 Καὶ ἐγένετο, ὡς ἤκουσεν Ἰεζάβελ, ὅτι λελιθοβόληται Ναβουθαὶ καὶ ἀπέθανε, καὶ εἶπεν Ἰεζάβελ πρὸς Ἀχαάβ· ἀνάστα, κληρονόμησαι τὸν ἀμπελῶνα Ναβουθαὶ τοῦ Ἰεζραηλίτου, ὃς οὐκ ἔδωκέ σοι ἀργυρίου, ὅτι

**Chapter 21**

**(continued from verse 2)**
"...Or if it please thee, I will give thee silver in exchange for this vineyard, that it may be unto me a garden of herbs."

**3** And Naboth said unto Ahab, "The Lord forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee."

**4** And Ahab came unto his house, dejected and disheartened, because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken unto him, saying, "I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers." And he lay down upon his bed, and covered his face, and ate no bread.

**5** And Jezebel his wife came in unto him, and spake unto him, "Why is thy spirit troubled, and why eatest thou no bread?"

**6** And he said unto her, "Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, saying, 'Give me thy vineyard for money; or if thou wilt, I will give thee another vineyard for it.' And he said, 'I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers.'"

**7** And Jezebel his wife said unto him, "Dost thou now thus execute dominion over Israel? Arise, eat bread, and be of good courage: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite."

**8** And she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders, [and] unto the free men that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth.

**9** And it was written in the letters, saying, "Proclaim a fast, and seat Naboth at the head of the people;

**10** and seat two men, sons of lawless ones, opposite him, and let them testify against him, saying, 'He cursed God and the king.' And then let them lead him out, and stone him with stones, and let him die."

**11** And the men of his city, the elders, and the free men who dwelt in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, according as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them.

**12** They proclaimed a fast, and they seated Naboth at the head of the people.

**13** And there came two men, sons of lawless ones, and sat opposite him; and the men of apostasy testified against Naboth before the people, saying, "Naboth cursed God and the king." And they led him out of the city, and stoned him with stones, and he died.

**14** And they sent unto Jezebel, saying, "Naboth is stoned, and is dead."

**15** And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said unto Ahab, "Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he would not give thee for money, because..."
