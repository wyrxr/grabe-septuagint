καὶ πεντήκοντα καὶ πέντε ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ
2 ὄνομα τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ Ὀρφιδά. Καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ πονηρὸν ἐν
ὀφθαλμοῖς Κυρίου κατὰ τὰ βδελύγματα τῶν ἐθνῶν, ὧν ἐξῆρε
3 Κύριος ἀπὸ προσώπου τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἀπέστρεψε, καὶ
ᾠκοδόμησε τὰ ὑψηλὰ ἃ κατέσκαψεν Ἑζεκίας ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ καὶ
ἀνέστησε τὸ θυσιαστήριον τῇ Βάαλ, καὶ ἐποίησεν ἄλση, καθώς
ἐποίησεν Ἀχαὰβ βασιλεὺς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ προσεκύνησε πάσῃ τῇ δυνά-
4 μει τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ ἐδούλευσεν αὐτοῖς. Καὶ ᾠκοδόμησε τὸ θυ-
σιαστήριον ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου, ὡς εἶπεν, ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ θήσω τὸ
5 ὄνομά μου· καὶ ᾠκοδόμησε τὸ θυσιαστήριον πάσῃ τῇ δυνάμει
6 τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ἐν ταῖς δυσὶν αὐλαῖς οἴκου Κυρίου· καὶ διῆγε τοὺς
υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ ἐν πυρί, καὶ ἐκληδονίζετο, καὶ οἰωνίζετο, καὶ ἐποίησε
θελητὴν καὶ γνωστάς· ἐπλήθυνε τοῦ ποιεῖν τὸ πονηρὸν ἐν ὀφθαλ-
7 μοῖς Κυρίου, παροργίσαι αὐτόν. Καὶ ἔθηκε τὸ γλυπτὸν τοῦ
ἄλσους ὡς ἐποίησεν, ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ ᾧ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Δαυίδ,
καὶ πρὸς Σαλωμῶν τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ, ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τούτῳ, καὶ ἐν
Ἱερουσαλήμ, ἣν ἐξελεξάμην ἐκ πασῶν φυλῶν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ θήσω
8 τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐκεῖ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, καὶ οὐ προσθήσω τοῦ σα-
λεῦσαι τὸν πόδα Ἰσραὴλ ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς, ἧς ἔδωκα τοῖς πατράσιν
αὐτῶν, οἵτινες φυλάξουσι τοῦ ποιεῖν πάντα ὅσα ἐνετειλάμην
αὐτοῖς, καὶ κατὰ πᾶσαν τὴν ἐντολὴν ἣν ἐνετείλατο αὐτοῖς ὁ δοῦλός
9 μου Μωσῆς. Καὶ οὐκ ἤκουσαν, καὶ ἐπλάνησεν αὐτοὺς Μανασσῆς
τοῦ ποιῆσαι τὸ πονηρὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς Κυρίου ὑπὲρ τὰ ἔθνη, ἃ
10 ἠφάνισε Κύριος ἐκ προσώπου υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἐλάλησε Κύριος
11 ἐν χειρὶ δούλων αὐτοῦ, τῶν προφητῶν, λέγων· ἀνθ’ ὧν ὅσα
ἐποίησε Μανασσῆς ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἰούδα τὰ βδελύγματα ταῦτα τὰ
πονηρὰ ἀπὸ πάντων ὧν ἐποίησεν ὁ Ἀμοῤῥαῖος ὁ ἔμπροσθεν, καὶ
12 ἐξήμαρτε καί γε τὸν Ἰούδαν ἐν τοῖς εἰδώλοις αὐτῶν. Οὐχ οὕτως.
τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ φέρω ἐπὶ Ἱερου-
σαλήμ κακά, καὶ ἐπὶ Ἰούδαν, ὥστε παντὸς ἀκούοντος ἠχήσει
13 ἀμφότερα τὰ ὦτα αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐκτενῶ ἐπὶ Ἱερουσαλὴμ τὸ μέ-
τρον Σαμαρείας, καὶ τὸ στάθμιον οἴκου Ἀχαάβ· καὶ ἀπαλείψω
τὴν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καθὼς ἀπαλείφεται τὸ ἀλάβαστρον ἀπαλειφό-
14 μενος, καὶ καταστρέφεται ἐπὶ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἀπεδώ-
μαι τὸ ὑπόλειμμα τῆς κληρονομίας μου, καὶ παραδώσω αὐτοὺς
εἰς χεῖρας ἐχθρῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔσονται εἰς διαρπαγήν, καὶ εἰς

### Literary Translation:

### 2 Kings 21

**1** And fifty and five years reigned he in Jerusalem; and
**2** the name of his mother was Ophida. And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, according to the abominations of the nations, whom the Lord had cast out from before the face of the children of Israel.
**3** For he turned back, and built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he set up an altar for Baal, and made groves, as Ahab king of Israel had done; and he bowed down to all the host of heaven, and served them.
**4** And he built an altar in the house of the Lord, of which He had said, "In Jerusalem will I put My Name."
**5** And he built an altar for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the House of the Lord.
**6** And he caused his sons to pass through the fire, and he practiced augury, and used divination, and he made enchanters and witches; he multiplied to do evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke Him to wrath.
**7** And he set the carved image of the grove, which he had made, in the house of which the Lord had said unto David, and unto Solomon his son, "In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put My Name forever."
**8** "And I will not add [hereafter] to remove the foot of Israel from the land which I gave unto their fathers; if only they will keep to do all things whatsoever I have commanded them, and according to all the commandment which My servant Moses commanded them."
**9** But they hearkened not; and Manasseh led them astray to do evil in the sight of the Lord, beyond the nations, which the Lord had destroyed from before the face of the children of Israel.
**10** And the Lord spake by the hand of His servants the prophets, saying,
**11** "Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these evil abominations, more than all that which the Amorite had done before him, and hath caused Judah also to sin with their idols— not so!
**12** Thus saith the Lord God of Israel: Behold, I bring such evils upon Jerusalem and upon Judah, that whosoever heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle.
**13** And I will stretch out over Jerusalem the measuring line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab; and I will wipe away Jerusalem, as the alabaster [vessel] is wiped, being wiped, and overturned upon its face.
**14** And I have relinquished the remnant of Mine inheritance, and I will deliver them into the hands of their enemies; and they shall become a prey, and unto [a fate].
