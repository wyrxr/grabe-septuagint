ΚΕΦ. ΙΓ΄.

⁶ διαθήκη ἁλός; Καὶ ἀνέστη Ἱεροβοὰμ ὁ τοῦ Ναβάτ, ὁ παῖς Σαλω-
⁷ μὼν τοῦ Δαυίδ, καὶ ἀπέστη ἀπὸ τοῦ κυρίου ἑαυτοῦ. Καὶ συνήχθη-
   σαν πρὸς αὐτὸν ἄνδρες λοιμοί, υἱοὶ παράνομοι, καὶ ἀντέστη πρὸς
   Ῥοβοὰμ υἱὸν Σαλωμών, καὶ Ῥοβοὰμ ἦν νεώτερος καὶ δειλὸς τῇ
⁸ καρδίᾳ, καὶ οὐκ ἀντέστη κατὰ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ. Καὶ νῦν λέγετε
   ὑμεῖς ἀντιστῆναι κατὰ πρόσωπον βασιλείας Κυρίου διὰ χειρὸς υἱῶν
   Δαυίδ· καὶ ὑμεῖς πλῆθος πολύ, καὶ μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν μόσχοι χρυσοῖ οὓς
⁹ ἐποίησεν ὑμῖν Ἱεροβοὰμ εἰς θεούς. Ἢ οὐκ ἐξεβάλετε τοὺς ἱερεῖς
   Κυρίου, τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἀαρών, καὶ τοὺς Λευίτας, καὶ ἐποιήσατε ἑαυ-
   τοῖς ἱερεῖς ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ τῆς γῆς; πᾶς ὁ προσπορευόμενος πληρώ-
   σαι τὰς χεῖρας ἐν μόσχῳ ἐκ βοῶν καὶ κριοῖς ἑπτά, καὶ ἐγένετο εἰς
¹⁰ ἱερέα τῷ μὴ ὄντι Θεῷ. Καὶ ἡμεῖς Κύριον τὸν Θεὸν ἡμῶν οὐκ ἐγ-
    καταλείπομεν, καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς αὐτοῦ λειτουργοῦσι τῷ Κυρίῳ, υἱοὶ
¹¹ Ἀαρών, καὶ οἱ Λευῖται, καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἐφημερίαις ἑαυτῶν, θυμιῶσι
    τῷ Κυρίῳ ὁλοκαυτώματα πρωὶ καὶ δείλης, καὶ θυμίαμα συνθέ-
    σεως, καὶ προθέσεις ἄρτων ἐπὶ τῆς τραπέζης τῆς καθαρᾶς, καὶ ἡ
    λυχνία ἡ χρυσῆ, καὶ οἱ λύχνοι τῆς καύσεως ἀνάψαι δείλης· ὅτι φυ-
    λάσσομεν ἡμεῖς τὰς φυλακὰς Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν,
¹² καὶ ὑμεῖς ἐγκατελείπετε αὐτόν. Καὶ ἰδοὺ μεθ᾿ ἡμῶν ἐν ἀρχῇ Κύ-
    ριος καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς αὐτοῦ, καὶ σάλπιγγες τῆς σημασίας τοῦ σημαί-
¹³ νειν ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς. Καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ μὴ πολεμήσητε πρὸς Κύ-
    ριον Θεὸν τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν, ὅτι οὐκ εὐοδωθήσεται ὑμῖν. Καὶ Ἱε-
¹⁴ ροβοὰμ ἀπέστρεψε τὸ ἔνεδρον ἐλθεῖν αὐτῷ ἐκ τῶν ὄπισθεν, καὶ ἐγέ-
    νετο ἔμπροσθεν Ἰούδα, καὶ τὸ ἔνεδρον ἐκ τῶν ὄπισθεν. Καὶ ἀπ-
¹⁵ έστρεψεν Ἰούδας, καὶ ἰδοὺ ὁ πόλεμος αὐτοῖς ἐκ τῶν ἔμπροσθεν, καὶ
    ἐκ τῶν ὄπισθεν, καὶ ἐβόησαν πρὸς Κύριον, καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς ἐσάλπισαν
¹⁶ ταῖς σάλπιγξι. Καὶ ἐβόησαν ἄνδρες Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ βοᾷν
    ἄνδρας Ἰούδα, καὶ Κύριος ἐπάταξε τὸν Ἱεροβοὰμ καὶ τὸν Ἰσραὴλ
¹⁷ ἐναντίον Ἀβιὰ καὶ Ἰούδα. Καὶ ἔφυγον οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἀπὸ προσώ-
    που Ἰούδα, καὶ παρέδωκεν αὐτοὺς Κύριος εἰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν. Καὶ
    ἐπάταξεν ἐν αὐτοῖς Ἀβιὰ καὶ ὁ λαὸς αὐτοῦ πληγὴν μεγάλην, καὶ
    ἔπεσαν τραυματίαι ἀπὸ Ἰσραὴλ πεντακόσιαι χιλιάδες, ἄνδρες δυ-
¹⁸ νατοί· καὶ ἐταπεινώθησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, καὶ
    κατίσχυσαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰούδα, ὅτι ἤλπισαν ἐπὶ Κύριον Θεὸν τῶν πα-
¹⁹ τέρων ἑαυτῶν. Καὶ κατεδίωξεν Ἀβιὰ ὀπίσω Ἱεροβοάμ, καὶ προ-
    κατελάβετο παρ᾿ αὐτοῦ πόλεις, τὴν Βαιθὴλ καὶ τὰς κώμας αὐτῆς,

**Chapter 13**

⁶ ...[by] a covenant of salt?
And Jeroboam, the son of Nebat,
The servant of Solomon, arose,
⁷ the son of David, and rebelled against his own lord.
And there were gathered unto him worthless men,
Sons of lawlessness, and they made opposition against Rehoboam,
The son of Solomon. Now Rehoboam was young and timid of heart,
⁸ and he could not withstand them.
And now ye say that ye will withstand the kingdom of the Lord
By the hand of the sons of David;
And ye are a great multitude, and with you are the golden calves
Which
⁹ Jeroboam made for you for gods.
Have ye not cast out the priests of the Lord,
The sons of Aaron, and the Levites?
And have ye not made for yourselves priests
From the people of the land?
Whosoever cometh to fill his hands [for consecration]
With a calf from the cattle and with seven rams,
He then becometh a priest
¹⁰ to that which is not God.
But as for us, we forsake not the Lord our God,
And His priests minister unto the Lord,
[Even] the sons of Aaron,
¹¹ and the Levites; and in their daily courses
They offer unto the Lord burnt offerings morning and evening,
And compounded incense, and the showbreads
Upon the pure table, and the golden lampstand,
And the lamps for burning to light at evening.
For we keep the ordinances of the Lord,
The God of our fathers;
¹² but ye have forsaken Him.
And behold, the Lord is with us as our leader,
And His priests, and the trumpets of alarm
To sound against you.
¹³ And ye, O sons of Israel, war ye not
Against the Lord God of our fathers,
For ye shall not prosper.
Now Jeroboam had turned the ambush to come to him from behind.
¹⁴ And it came to pass that [the battle-line was] before Judah,
And the ambush from behind.
And Judah turned, and behold, the war was for them
From the front and from behind.
And they cried unto the Lord,
And the priests sounded
¹⁵ with the trumpets.
And the men of Judah shouted,
And it came to pass when the men of Judah shouted,
That the Lord struck down Jeroboam and Israel
¹⁶ before Abijah and Judah.
And the sons of Israel fled from the face of Judah,
And the Lord delivered them into their hands.
¹⁷ And Abijah and his people struck a great blow among them,
And there fell slain from Israel five hundred thousand mighty men.
¹⁸ And the sons of Israel were humbled on that day,
And the sons of Judah prevailed,
Because they had put their trust in the Lord,
The God of
¹⁹ their fathers.
And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam,
And captured from him cities:
Bethel with its villages,
