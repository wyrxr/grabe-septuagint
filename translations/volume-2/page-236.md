### 2 Kings 24

**14** And he carried away into exile all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and the men mighty in strength, having taken captive ten thousand captives; yea, every carpenter, and the smith, and none were left save the poorest sort of the land.
**15** And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his eunuchs, and the mighty men of the land he led away into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon.
**16** And all the men of war, seven thousand, and the carpenters and smiths, one thousand; all of them mighty men, makers of war: these did the king of Babylon bring into exile to Babylon.
**17** And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah, his son, reign in his stead, and he put upon him the name Zedekiah.
**18** Zedekiah was a son of twenty and one years when he began to reign, and eleven years he reigned in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Amital, the daughter of Jeremiah, from Libnah.
**19** And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
**20** For it was by the wrath of the Lord upon Jerusalem, and upon Judah, until He cast them away from His presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.

### 2 Kings 25

**1** And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the eleventh day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came, and all his army, against Jerusalem; and he encamped against it, and built a siege-wall round about it.
**2** And the city came into siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah, on the ninth day of the month.
**3** And the famine grew strong in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.
**4** And the city was broken through, and all the men of war went forth by night by the way of the gate which is between the two walls, even that which is by the king's garden (now the Chaldeans were round about the city).
**5** And he went by the way of the Arabah, and the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and they overtook him in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.

14 Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τῷ ναῷ Κυρίου κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα Κυρίου. Καὶ ἀπῴκισε
    πᾶσαν τὴν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ πάντας τοὺς ἄρχοντας, καὶ τοὺς
    δυνατοὺς ἰσχύϊ, αἰχμαλωσίας δέκα χιλιάδας αἰχμαλωτίσας, καὶ
    πάντα τέκτονα, καὶ τὸν συγκλείοντα, καὶ οὐχ ὑπελείφθη πλὴν
15 οἱ πτωχοὶ τῆς γῆς. Καὶ ἀπῴκισε τὸν Ἰωαχεὶν εἰς Βαβυλῶνα,
    καὶ τὴν μητέρα τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ τὰς γυναῖκας τοῦ βασιλέως,
    καὶ τοὺς εὐνούχους αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοὺς ἰσχυροὺς τῆς γῆς ἀπήγαγεν
16 ἀποικεσίαν ἐξ Ἱερουσαλὴμ εἰς Βαβυλῶνα· καὶ πάντας τοὺς
    ἄνδρας τῆς δυνάμεως, ἑπτακισχιλίους, καὶ τὸν τέκτονα, καὶ τὸν
    συγκλείοντα, χιλίους· πάντες δυνατοὶ ποιοῦντες πόλεμον. Καὶ
    ἤγαγεν αὐτοὺς βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος μετοικεσίαν εἰς Βαβυλῶνα.
17 Καὶ ἐβασίλευσε βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος τὸν Μεθανίαν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ
18 ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπέθηκε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Σεδεκίαν. Υἱὸς εἴκοσι
    καὶ ἑνὸς ἐτῶν Σεδεκίας ἐν τῷ βασιλεύειν αὐτόν, καὶ ἕνδεκα
    ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ὄνομα τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ
19 Ἀμιτάλ, θυγάτηρ Ἱερεμίου, ἀπὸ Λοβνά. Καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ πο-
    νηρὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς Κυρίου, κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν Ἰωακείμ.
20 Ὅτι ἐπὶ τὸν θυμὸν Κυρίου ἦν ἐπὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἐν τῷ
    Ἰούδα, ἕως ἀπέρριψεν αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἠθέτησε
    Σεδεκίας ἐν τῷ βασιλεῖ Βαβυλῶνος.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΕʹ. XXV.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἔτει τῷ ἐννάτῳ τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ, ἐν
    τῷ μηνὶ τῷ δεκάτῳ, ἑνδεκάτῃ τοῦ μηνός, ἦλθε Ναβουχοδονόσορ
    βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος, καὶ πᾶσα ἡ δύναμις αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ·
    καὶ παρενέβαλεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτήν, καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὴν
2 περίτειχος κύκλῳ. Καὶ ἦλθεν εἰς πόλιν περιοχῆς ἕως τοῦ
    ἑνδεκάτου ἔτους τοῦ βασιλέως Σεδεκίου, ἐννάτῃ τοῦ μηνός.
3 Καὶ ἐνίσχυσεν ὁ λιμὸς ἐν τῇ πόλει, καὶ οὐκ ἦσαν ἄρτοι τῷ
4 λαῷ τῆς γῆς. Καὶ ἐῤῥάγη ἡ πόλις, καὶ πάντες οἱ ἄνδρες τοῦ
    πολέμου ἐξῆλθον νυκτὸς ὁδὸν πύλης τῆς ἀναμέσον τῶν τειχῶν,
    (αὕτη) ἡ ἐστι τοῦ κήπου τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ οἱ Χαλδαῖοι ἐπὶ
5 τὴν πόλιν κύκλῳ. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη ὁδὸν τὴν Ἄραβα, καὶ ἐδίωξεν
    ἡ δύναμις τῶν Χαλδαίων ὀπίσω τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ κατέλαβον
    αὐτὸν ἐν Ἀραβὼθ Ἰεριχώ, καὶ πᾶσα ἡ δύναμις αὐτοῦ διεσπάρη
