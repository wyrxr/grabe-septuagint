ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Γ΄. ΚΕΦ. Γ΄.
σοῦ, καὶ ἐφύλαξας αὐτῷ τὸ ἔλεός (σου) τὸ μέγα τοῦτο δοῦναι τὸν
υἱὸν αὐτοῦ καθήμενον ἐπὶ τοῦ θρόνου αὐτοῦ, ὡς ἡ ἡμέρα αὕτη.
7 Καὶ νῦν, Κύριε ὁ Θεός μου, σὺ ἔδωκας τὸν δοῦλόν σου ἀντὶ
Δαυῒδ τοῦ πατρός μου. Καὶ ἐγώ εἰμι παιδάριον μικρόν, καὶ οὐκ
8 οἶδα τὴν εἴσοδόν μου, καὶ τὴν ἔξοδόν μου. Ὁ δὲ δοῦλός σου ἐν
μέσω τοῦ λαοῦ σου ὃν ἐξελέξω λαὸν πολύς, ὃς οὐκ ἀριθμηθήσε-
9 ται, καὶ οὐ ψηφισθήσεται ἀπὸ πλήθους. Καὶ δώσεις τῷ δούλῳ
σου καρδίαν ἀκούειν, καὶ διακρίνειν τὸν λαόν σου ἐν δικαιοσύνῃ,
τοῦ συνιέναι ἀναμέσον ἀγαθοῦ καὶ κακοῦ· ὅτι τίς δυνήσεται κρί-
10 νειν τὸν λαόν σου τὸν βαρὺν τοῦτον; Καὶ ἤρεσεν ὁ λόγος ἐνώ-
11 πιον Κυρίου, ὅτι ἠτήσατο Σαλωμὼν τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο. Καὶ εἶπε
Κύριος πρὸς αὐτόν· ἀνθ᾿ ὧν ἠτήσω παρ᾿ ἐμοῦ τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο,
καὶ οὐκ ἠτήσω σεαυτῷ ἡμέρας πολλάς, καὶ οὐκ ἠτήσω σεαυτῷ
πλοῦτον, οὐδὲ ἠτήσω ψυχὰς ἐχθρῶν σου, ἀλλ᾿ ἠτήσω σεαυτῷ τοῦ
12 συνιεῖν τοῦ εἰσακούειν κρίμα· ἰδοὺ πεποίηκα κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμά σου·
Ἰδοὺ δέδωκά σοι καρδίαν σοφὴν καὶ φρονίμην, ὡς σὺ οὐ γέγονεν
13 ἔμπροσθέν σου, καὶ μετὰ σὲ οὐκ ἀναστήσεται ὅμοιός σοι. Καὶ ἃ
οὐκ ἠτήσω ἔδωκά σοι, καὶ πλοῦτον, καὶ δόξαν, ὡς οὐ γέγονεν
14 ἀνὴρ ὅμοιός σοι ἐν βασιλεῦσι πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας σου. Καὶ ἐὰν
πορευθῇς ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ μου φυλάσσειν τὰ προστάγματά μου, καὶ τὰς
ἐντολάς μου, ὡς ἐπορεύθη Δαυῒδ ὁ πατήρ σου, καὶ πληθυνῶ τὰς
15 ἡμέρας σου. Καὶ ἐξυπνίσθη Σαλωμών, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐνύπνιον. Καὶ ἀνέστη
καὶ παραγίνεται εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἔστη κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ θυσιαστη-
ρίου τοῦ κατὰ πρόσωπον κιβωτοῦ διαθήκης Κυρίου ἐν Σιών, καὶ ἀνήγα-
γεν ὁλοκαυτώσεις, καὶ ἐποίησεν εἰρηνικάς, καὶ ἐποίησε πότον μέγαν
16 ἑαυτῷ, καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς παισὶν ἑαυτοῦ. Τότε ὤφθησαν δύο γυναῖκες πόρναι
17 τῷ βασιλεῖ, καὶ ἔστησαν ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπεν ἡ γυνὴ ἡ
μία· ἐν ἐμοί, κύριέ μου. Ἐγὼ καὶ ἡ γυνὴ αὕτη ᾠκοῦμεν ἐν οἴ-
18 κῳ ἑνί, καὶ ἐτέκομεν ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ. Καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ
τῇ τρίτῃ τεκούσης μου, καὶ ἔτεκε καὶ αὕτη ἡ γυνή· καὶ ἡμεῖς
κατὰ τὸ αὐτό, οὐκ ἔστιν οὐδεὶς μεθ᾿ ἡμῶν ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ πάρεξ ἀμ-
19 φοτέρων ἡμῶν ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ. Καὶ ἀπέθανεν ὁ υἱὸς τῆς γυναικὸς
20 ταύτης τὴν νύκτα, ὡς ἐκοιμήθη ἐπ᾿ αὐτόν. Καὶ ἀνέστη μέσης
τῆς νυκτός, καὶ ἔλαβε τὸν υἱόν μου ἐκ τῶν ἀγκαλῶν μου, καὶ ἡ
δούλη σου ὕπνου, καὶ ἐκοίμισεν αὐτὸν ἐν τῷ κόλπῳ αὐτῆς, καὶ
21 τὸν υἱὸν αὐτῆς τὸν τεθνηκότα ἐκοίμισεν ἐν τῷ κόλπῳ μου. Κα

### A Royal Translation of the Third Book of Kingdoms, Chapter 3

**6** Thee, and Thou hast kept for him this great mercy [of Thine] to give his son sitting upon his throne, as it is this day.

**7** And now, O Lord my God, Thou hast made Thy servant king instead of David my father; and I am but a little child, and know not my going out and my coming in.

**8** And Thy servant is in the midst of Thy people, whom Thou hast chosen, a great people, which cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.

**9** Give therefore unto Thy servant an understanding heart to judge Thy people with righteousness, and to discern between good and evil; for who is able to judge this Thy great people?

**10** And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.

**11** And the Lord said unto him, "Because thou hast asked this thing of Me, and hast not asked for thyself long life, neither hast asked for thyself riches, nor hast asked for the lives of thine enemies, but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;

**12** behold, I have done according to thy word. Behold, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart, so that there hath been none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.

**13** And that which thou hast not asked, I have given thee, both riches and honor, so that there shall not be any man like unto thee among the kings all thy days.

**14** And if thou wilt walk in My ways, to keep My statutes and My commandments, as thy father David walked, then I will multiply thy days."

**15** And Solomon awoke, and, behold, it was a dream. And he arose, and came to Jerusalem, and stood before the altar of the LORD, which was before the ark of the covenant of the Lord in Zion, and offered up burnt offerings, and made peace offerings, and made a great feast for himself and for all his servants.

**16** Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him.

**17** And the one woman said, "O my lord, I and this woman dwelt in one house, and we were delivered in the house.

**18** And it came to pass the third day after I was delivered, that this woman also was delivered. And we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house.

**19** And this woman's child died in the night, because she lay upon it.

**20** And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thine handmaid was in slumber, and laid him in her bosom, and her dead son she laid in my bosom.

**21** And
