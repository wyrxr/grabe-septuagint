### 2 Kings 13

**6** σκηνώμασιν αὐτῶν καθὼς ἐχθὲς καὶ τρίτης. Πλὴν οὐκ ἀπέστησαν ἀπὸ ἁμαρτίας οἴκου Ἱεροβοὰμ (υἱοῦ Ναβὰτ) ὃς ἐξήμαρτε τὸν Ἰσραήλ, ἐν αὐτῇ ἐπορεύθησαν. καί γε τὸ ἄλσος ἐστάθη ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ.
**7** Ὅτι οὐχ ὑπελείφθη τῷ Ἰωάχαζ λαὸς ἀλλ᾽ ἢ πεντήκοντα ἱππεῖς, καὶ δέκα ἅρματα, καὶ δέκα χιλιάδες πεζῶν, ὅτι ἀπώλεσεν αὐτοὺς βασιλεὺς Συρίας, καὶ ἔθεντο αὐτοὺς ὡς χοῦν εἰς καταπάτησιν.
**8** Καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Ἰωάχαζ, καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησε, καὶ αἱ δυναστείαι αὐτοῦ, οὐκ ἰδοὺ ταῦτα γεγραμμένα ἐπὶ βιβλίου λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν Ἰσραήλ;
**9** Καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Ἰωάχαζ μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ. καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Ἰωὰς υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀντ᾽ αὐτοῦ.
**10** Ἐν ἔτει τριακοστῷ καὶ ἑβδόμῳ ἔτει τῷ Ἰωὰς βασιλεῖ Ἰούδα ἐβασίλευσεν Ἰωὰς υἱὸς Ἰωάχαζ, ἐπὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ ἐκκαίδεκα ἔτη.
**11** Καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ πονηρὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς Κυρίου· οὐκ ἀπέστη ἀπὸ πάσης ἁμαρτίας Ἱεροβοὰμ υἱοῦ Ναβὰτ ὃς ἐξήμαρτε τὸν Ἰσραήλ, ἐν αὐταῖς ἐπορεύθη.
**12** Καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Ἰωάς, καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησε, καὶ αἱ δυναστείαι αὐτοῦ, ἃς ἐποίησε μετὰ Ἀμεσίου βασιλέως Ἰούδα, οὐχὶ ταῦτα γεγραμμένα ἐπὶ βιβλίου λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν Ἰσραήλ;
**13** Καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Ἰωὰς μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ, καὶ Ἱεροβοὰμ ἐκάθισεν ἐπὶ τοῦ θρόνου αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐτάφη Ἰωὰς ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ μετὰ τῶν βασιλέων Ἰσραήλ.
**14** Καὶ Ἐλισσαιὲ ἠρρώστησε τὴν ἀρρωστίαν αὐτοῦ, δι᾽ ἣν ἀπέθανε· καὶ κατέβη πρὸς αὐτὸν Ἰωὰς βασιλεὺς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἔκλαυσεν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπε· πάτερ, πάτερ, ἅρμα Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἱππεὺς αὐτοῦ.
**15** Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Ἐλισσαιέ· λάβε τόξον καὶ βέλη. καὶ ἔλαβε πρὸς αὐτὸν τόξον καὶ βέλη.
**16** Καὶ εἶπε τῷ βασιλεῖ Ἰσραήλ· ἐπιβίβασον τὴν χεῖρά σου ἐπὶ τὸ τόξον. Καὶ ἐπεβίβασεν Ἰωὰς τὴν χεῖρα αὑτοῦ ἐπὶ τὸ τόξον. Καὶ ἐπέθηκεν Ἐλισσαιὲ τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ
**17** τὰς χεῖρας τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ εἶπεν· ἄνοιξον τὴν θυρίδα κατ᾽ ἀνατολάς. καὶ ἤνοιξε. καὶ εἶπεν Ἐλισσαιέ· ῥοΐζησον. καὶ ἐροΐζησε. Καὶ εἶπε· βέλος σωτηρίας τῷ Κυρίῳ, καὶ βέλος σωτηρίας ἐν Συρίᾳ, καὶ πατάξεις τὴν Συρίαν ἐν Ἀφὲκ ἕως συντελείας.
**18** Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Ἐλισσαιέ· λάβε τόξα. καὶ ἔλαβε. καὶ εἶπε τῷ βασιλεῖ Ἰσραήλ· πάταξον εἰς τὴν γῆν. καὶ ἐπάταξεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τρίς, καὶ
**19** ἔστη. Καὶ ἐλυπήθη ἐπ᾽ αὐτῷ ὁ ἄνθρωπος τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ εἶπεν· εἰ ἐπάταξας πεντάκις ἢ ἑξάκις, τότε ἂν ἐπάταξας τὴν Συρίαν ἕως

### CHAPTER XIII

**6** their tents, as in times past. Nevertheless, they departed not from the sin of the house of Jeroboam, (the son of Nebat,) who made Israel to sin; in it did they walk. And moreover, the Asherah pole remained in Samaria.
**7** For there was not left to Jehoahaz a people, but only fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria had destroyed them, and made them as the dust by trampling.
**8** Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his mighty deeds, behold, are these not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
**9** And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in Samaria. And Joash his son reigned in his stead.
**10** In the thirty and seventh year of Joash, king of Judah, did Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, begin to reign over Israel in Samaria, for sixteen years.
**11** And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin; in them did he walk.
**12** Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his mighty deeds, which he did with Amaziah, king of Judah, are these not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
**13** And Joash slept with his fathers, and Jeroboam sat upon his throne, and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
**14** Now Elisha was sick with the sickness whereof he died. And Joash, the king of Israel, came down unto him, and wept over his face, and said, "O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horseman thereof!"
**15** And Elisha said unto him, "Take a bow and arrows." And he took unto him a bow and arrows.
**16** And he said unto the king of Israel, "Place thy hand upon the bow." And Joash placed his hand upon the bow. And Elisha laid his hand upon
**17** the hands of the king, and said, "Open the window eastward." And he opened it. And Elisha said, "Shoot." And he shot. And he said, "This is the arrow of the LORD's deliverance, even the arrow of deliverance against Syria; for thou shalt smite Syria in Aphek until [their] utter destruction."
**18** And Elisha said unto him, "Take arrows." And he took [them]. And he said unto the king of Israel, "Strike the ground." And the king struck [it] thrice, and
**19** ceased. And the man of God was grieved at him, and said, "If thou hadst struck five times, or six times, then wouldst thou have smitten Syria until
