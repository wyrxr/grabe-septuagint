ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Γ´. ΚΕΦ. Η´.
ἐπὶ προσώπου πάσης τῆς γῆς, ἧς ἔδωκας τοῖς πατράσιν ὑμῶν.
41 Καὶ τῷ ἀλλοτρίῳ ὃς οὐκ ἔστιν ἀπὸ λαοῦ σου Ἰσραὴλ οὗτος, καὶ
ἔλθῃ ἀπὸ γῆς μακρόθεν ἕνεκα ὀνόματός σου, ὅτι ἀκούσουσι τὸ ὄ-
νομά σου τὸ μέγα, καὶ τὴν χεῖρά σου τὴν ἰσχύουσαν, καὶ βραχί-
42 ονά σου τὸν ἐκτεταμένον, Καὶ ἥξουσι, καὶ προσεύξονται εἰς τὸν
43 τόπον τοῦτον˙ Καὶ εἰσακούσῃ ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ἐξ ἑτοίμου κατοι-
κητηρίου σου, καὶ ποιήσεις κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἂν ἐπικαλέσηταί σε
ὁ ἀλλότριος, ὅπως γνῶσι πάντες οἱ λαοὶ τῆς γῆς τὸ ὄνομά σου,
καὶ φοβῶνταί σε, καθὼς ὁ λαός σου Ἰσραήλ, καὶ γνῶσιν ὅτι τὸ
44 ὄνομά σου ἐπικέκληται ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον ὃν ᾠκοδόμητα. Ὅτι ἐξελεύ-
σεται ὁ λαός σου εἰς πόλεμον ἐπὶ τοὺς ἐχθροὺς αὐτοῦ ἐν ὁδῷ ᾗ
ἐπιστρέψεις αὐτούς, καὶ προσεύξονται ἐν ὀνόματι Κυρίου ἕδων τῆς
πόλεως ἧς ἐξελέξω ἐν αὐτῇ, καὶ τοῦ οἴκου οὗ ᾠκοδόμησα τῷ
45 ὀνόματί σου. Καὶ εἰσακούσῃ ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ τῆς προσευχῆς αὐτῶν,
46 καὶ τῆς δεήσεως αὐτῶν, καὶ ποιήσεις τὸ δικαίωμα αὐτοῖς. Ὅτι
ἁμαρτήσονταί σοι, ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν ἄνθρωπος ὃς οὐχ ἁμαρτήσεταί σοι,
καὶ ἐπαρεῖς ἐπ᾽ αὐτούς, καὶ παραδώσεις αὐτοὺς ἐνώπιον ἐχθρῶν,
καὶ αἰχμαλωτιοῦσιν αὐτοὺς οἱ αἰχμαλωτίζοντες αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν
47 γῆν τοῦ ἐχθροῦ μακράν, καὶ ἐγγύς. Καὶ ἐπιστρέψουσι καρδίας
αὐτῶν ἐν τῇ γῇ οὗ μετήχθησαν ἐκεῖ, καὶ ἐπιστρέψωσι, καὶ δεη-
θῶσί σου ἐν γῇ μετοικίας αὐτῶν, λέγοντες˙ ἡμάρτομεν, ἠνομήσα-
48 μεν, ἠδικήσαμεν˙ Καὶ ἐπιστρέψωσι πρὸς σὲ ἐν ὅλῃ καρδίᾳ αὐτῶν,
καὶ ἐν ὅλῃ ψυχῇ αὐτῶν, ἐν τῇ γῇ ἐχθρῶν αὐτῶν οὗ μετήγαγες
αὐτούς, καὶ προσεύξονται πρὸς σὲ ὁδὸν γῆς αὐτῶν, ἧς ἔδωκας τοῖς πα-
τράσιν αὐτῶν, τῆς πόλεως ἧς ἐξελέξω, καὶ τοῦ οἴκου οὗ ᾠκοδόμησα τῷ
49 ὀνόματί σου. Καὶ εἰσακούσῃ ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ἐξ ἑτοίμου κατοικη-
τηρίου σου τὴν προσευχὴν αὐτῶν, καὶ τὴν δέησιν αὐτῶν, καὶ ποι-
50 ήσεις κρίσιν αὐτῶν˙ Καὶ ἵλεως ἔσῃ ταῖς ἀδικίαις αὐτῶν αἷς ἡμάρ-
τοσάν σοι, καὶ κατὰ πάντα τὰ ἀθετήματα αὐτῶν ἃ ἠθέτησάν σοι,
καὶ δώσεις αὐτοὺς εἰς οἰκτιρμοὺς ἐνώπιον αἰχμαλωτευόντων αὐ-
51 τούς, καὶ οἰκτειρήσουσιν αὐτούς˙ Ὅτι λαός σου καὶ κληρονομία
σου εἰσίν, οὓς ἐξήγαγες ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου ἐκ μέσου χωνευτη-
52 ρίου σιδήρου. Καὶ ἔστωσαν οἱ ὀφθαλμοί σου, καὶ τὰ ὦτά σου ἠ-
νεῳγμένα εἰς τὴν δέησιν τοῦ δούλου σου, καὶ εἰς τὴν δέησιν τοῦ
λαοῦ σου Ἰσραήλ, εἰσακούειν αὐτῶν ἐν πᾶσιν οἷς ἐὰν ἐπικαλέσων-
53 ταί σε. Ὅτι σὺ διέστειλας αὐτοὺς σαυτῷ εἰς κληρονομίαν ἐκ πάν-

### Translation of the Third Book of Kingdoms, Chapter 8

**40** upon the face of all the earth, which Thou gavest unto your fathers.

**41** Moreover, concerning the stranger, who is not of Thy people Israel, but cometh from a far land for Thy Name's sake—

**42** for they shall hear of Thy great Name, and of Thy mighty hand, and of Thy stretched-out arm—and they shall come and pray toward this place:

**43** Then Thou shalt hearken from heaven, from Thy prepared habitation, and shalt do according to all things whatsoever the stranger shall call upon Thee for; that all the peoples of the earth may know Thy Name, and fear Thee, as [do] Thy people Israel, and that they may know that Thy Name is called upon this House which I have built for Myself.

**44** When Thy people shall go out to war against their enemies, in the way wherein Thou shalt send them, and they shall pray in the Name of the Lord of the dwellings of the city which Thou hast chosen therein, and of the House which I have built for Thy Name:

**45** Then Thou shalt hearken from heaven unto their prayer, and their supplication, and shalt do them justice.

**46** For they shall sin against Thee—for there is no man who shall not sin against Thee—and Thou shalt be wroth against them, and deliver them before their enemies; and those who take them captive shall carry them away captive into the land of the enemy,

**47** far or near. And they shall turn their hearts in the land whither they were carried away, and shall turn again, and make supplication unto Thee in the land of their exile, saying, 'We have sinned, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly;'

**48** And they shall turn again unto Thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies whither Thou hast carried them away, and shall pray toward their land, which Thou gavest unto their fathers, and toward the city which Thou hast chosen, and toward the House which I have built for Thy Name:

**49** Then Thou shalt hearken from heaven, from Thy prepared habitation, unto their prayer and their supplication, and shalt do them justice;

**50** And Thou shalt be merciful unto their iniquities wherein they have sinned against Thee, and unto all their transgressions wherewith they have transgressed against Thee, and Thou shalt cause them to be pitied before those who carry them away captive,

**51** that they may have compassion on them; for they are Thy people and Thine inheritance, whom Thou didst bring forth out of the land of Egypt from the midst of the furnace of iron.

**52** And let Thine eyes and Thine ears be open unto the supplication of Thy servant, and unto the supplication of Thy people Israel, to hearken unto them in all things whatsoever they shall call upon Thee for.

**53** For Thou hast set them apart for Thyself as an inheritance from all the peoples of the earth.
