ἐβουλεύσατο ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ταῖς πρώταις, ὃν τρόπον ἐπερωτήσῃ ἐν
Λόγῳ τοῦ Θεοῦ· οὕτως πᾶσα ἡ βουλὴ τοῦ Ἀχιτόφελ καὶ γε τῷ
Δαυὶδ καὶ γε τῷ Ἀβεσσαλώμ.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΖʹ XVII.

ΚΑὶ εἶπεν Ἀχιτόφελ πρὸς Ἀβεσσαλώμ· ἐπιλέξω δὴ ἐμαυτῷ 1
δώδεκα χιλιάδας ἀνδρῶν, καὶ ἀναστήσομαι, καὶ καταδιώξω ὀπί-
σω Δαυὶδ τὴν νύκτα. Καὶ ἐπελεύσομαι ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸν, καὶ αὐτὸς κο- 2
πιῶν καὶ ἐκλελυμένος χερσὶ, καὶ ἐκστήσω αὐτὸν, καὶ ἐκφεύξε-
ται πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ὁ μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ, καὶ πατάξω τὸν βασιλέα ἱμονώ-
τατον. Καὶ ἐπιστρέψω πάντα τὸν λαὸν πρὸς σὲ, ὃν τρόπον ἐπι- 3
στρέφει ἡ νύμφη πρὸς τὸν ἄνδρα αὐτῆς. Πλὴν ψυχὴν ἑνὸς ἀνδρὸς
σὺ ζητεῖς, καὶ παντὶ τῷ λαῷ ἔσται εἰρήνη. Καὶ εὐθὺς ὁ λό- 4
γος ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς Ἀβεσσαλώμ, καὶ ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς πάντων τῶν
πρεσβυτέρων Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἀβεσσαλώμ· καλέσατε δὴ καί γε 5
τὸν Χουσεὶ τὸν Ἀραχεὶ, καὶ ἀκούσομεν τί ἐν τῷ στόματι αὐτοῦ,
καί γε αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἰσῆλθε Χουσεὶ πρὸς Ἀβεσσαλώμ. Καὶ εἶπεν 6
Ἀβεσσαλὼμ πρὸς αὐτὸν, λέγων· κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο ἐλάλησεν
Ἀχιτόφελ· ποιήσομεν κατὰ τὸν λόγον αὐτοῦ; εἰ δὲ μὴ, σὺ λάλη-
σον. Καὶ εἶπε Χουσῖ πρὸς Ἀβεσσαλώμ· οὐκ ἀγαθὴ αὕτη ἡ βου- 7
λὴ ἣν ἐβουλεύσατο Ἀχιτόφελ τὸ ἅπαξ τοῦτο. Καὶ εἶπε Χουσῖ· 8
σὺ οἶδας τὸν πατέρα σου καὶ τοὺς ἀνδρὰς αὐτοῦ, ὅτι δυνατοί εἰ-
σι σφόδρα καὶ κατάπικροι τῇ ψυχῇ αὐτῶν, ὡς ἄρκτος ἠτεκνωμέ-
νη ἐν ἀγρῷ· καὶ πατήρ σου ἀνὴρ πολεμιστὴς, καὶ οὐ μὴ κατα-
λύσῃ τὸν λαόν. Ἰδοὺ γὰρ αὐτὸς νῦν κέκρυπται ἐν ἑνὶ τῶν βου- 9
νῶν, ἢ ἐν ἐνὶ τῶν τόπων· καὶ ἔσται, ἐν τῷ ἐπιπεσεῖν αὐτοῖς ἐν
ἀρχῇ, καὶ ἀκούσῃ ὁ ἀκούων, καὶ εἴπῃ· ἐγενήθη θραῦσις ἐν τῷ
λαῷ ὀπίσω Ἀβεσσαλώμ· καί γε αὐτὸς υἱὸς δυνάμεως, οὗ ἡ καρ- 10
δία καθώς ἡ καρδία τοῦ λέοντος, τηκομένη τακήσεται· ὅτι οἶδε
πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ, ὅτι δυνατὸς ὁ πατήρ σου, καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ δυνάμεως, οἱ
μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ. Ὅτι οὕτως ἐγὼ συνεβούλευσα, καὶ συναγόμενος συν- 11
αχθήσεται ἐπὶ σὲ πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ ἀπὸ Δὰν καὶ ἕως Βηρσαβεὲ, ὡς ἡ
ἄμμος ἡ ἐπὶ τῆς θαλάσσης εἰς πλῆθος· καὶ τὸ πρόσωπόν σου πο-
ρευόμενον ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἥξομεν ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸν εἰς ἕνα τῶν 12
τόπων οὗ ἐὰν εὕρωμεν αὐτὸν ἐκεῖ, καὶ παρεμβαλοῦμεν ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸν,

### Chapter XVII

**17:1** Then said Ahithophel unto Absalom, "Let me, I pray thee, choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise, and pursue after David this night.
**2** And I will come upon him, when he is weary and weak-handed; and I will make him afraid, and all the people that are with him shall flee away, and I will smite the king, [him] most alone.
**3** And I shall cause all the people to return unto thee, as a bride returneth to her husband. For it is but the life of one man that thou seekest, and unto all the people shall there be peace."
**4** And the word seemed good in the eyes of Absalom, and in the eyes of all the elders of Israel.
**5** Then said Absalom, "Call ye now also Hushai the Archite, and let us hear what is in his mouth, [even] his [counsel]."
**6** And Hushai came in unto Absalom. And Absalom spake unto him, saying, "According to this word hath Ahithophel spoken. Shall we do after his saying? But if not, then speak thou."
**7** And Hushai said unto Absalom, "Not good is this counsel which Ahithophel hath given at this time."
**8** And Hushai said, "Thou knowest thy father and his men, that they are exceedingly mighty, and bitter in their souls, as a bear bereaved of her whelps in the field. For thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.
**9** For behold, he is now hidden in one of the mountains, or in one of the places. And it shall come to pass, when some of them shall be smitten at the first, that whosoever heareth it shall say, 'There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.'
**10** And even the valiant man, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt; for all Israel knoweth that thy father is mighty, and [that] they are men of might who are with him.
**11** Wherefore, this is the counsel I give: Let all Israel be surely gathered unto thee, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and let thy face go forth in the midst of them.
**12** And we will come upon him in one of the places where we shall find him there, and we will encamp against him,"
