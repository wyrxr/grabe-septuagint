5 διαθήκης τοῦ Θεοῦ, Ὀρνεὶ καὶ Φινεές. Καὶ ἐγενήθη ὡς ἦλθεν ἡ
κιβωτὸς διαθήκης Κυρίου εἰς τὴν παρεμβολήν, καὶ ἀνέκραζε πᾶς
6 Ἰσραὴλ φωνῇ μεγάλῃ, καὶ ἤχησεν ἡ γῆ. Καὶ ἤκουσαν οἱ ἀλ-
λόφυλοι τὴν φωνὴν τῆς κραυγῆς, καὶ εἶπαν οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι˙ τίς ἡ
κραυγὴ τοῦ ἀλαλαγμοῦ ἡ μεγάλη αὕτη ἐν παρεμβολῇ τῶν Ἑ-
7 βραίων; καὶ ἔγνωσαν ὅτι κιβωτὸς Κυρίου ἥκει εἰς τὴν παρεμβο-
λήν. Καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι, καὶ εἶπον˙ οὗτοι οἱ θεοὶ ἥκα-
σι πρὸς αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν παρεμβολήν. Ἐξελοῦ ἡμᾶς Κύριε σήμερον˙
8 οὐαὶ ἡμῖν, ὅτι οὐ γέγονε τοιαύτη ἐχθὲς καὶ τρίτης˙ οὐαὶ ἡμῖν,
9 τίς ἐξελεῖται ἡμᾶς ἐκ χειρὸς τῶν θεῶν τῶν στερεῶν τούτων;
οὗτοί εἰσιν οἱ θεοί, οἱ πατάξαντες τὴν Αἴγυπτον ἐν πάσῃ πλη-
γῇ καὶ ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ. Κραταιοῦσθε καὶ γίνεσθε εἰς ἄνδρας ἀλλό-
10 φυλοι, μήποτε δουλεύσητε τοῖς Ἑβραίοις, καθὼς ἐδούλευσαν ἡμῖν, καὶ
ἔσεσθε εἰς ἄνδρας, καὶ πολεμήσετε αὐτούς. Καὶ ἐπολέμησαν αὑ-
τούς˙ καὶ παταίει ἀνὴρ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἔφυγεν ἕκαστος εἰς σκήνωμα
αὑτοῦ, καὶ ἐγένετο πληγὴ μεγάλη σφόδρα, καὶ ἔπεσον ἐξ Ἰσρα-
11 ὴλ τριάκοντα χιλιάδες ταγμάτων. Καὶ ἡ κιβωτὸς τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐ-
λήφθη, καὶ ἀμφότεροι οἱ υἱοὶ Ἤλεὶ ἀπέθανον, Ὀρνεὶ καὶ Φινεές.
12 Καὶ ἔδραμεν ἀνὴρ Ἰεμμιναῖος ἐκ τῆς παρατάξεως, καὶ ἦλθεν εἰς
Σηλὼμ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ˙ καὶ τὰ ἱμάτια αὑτοῦ διερρωγότα, καὶ
13 γῆ ἐπὶ τῆς κεφαλῆς αὑτοῦ. Καὶ ἦλθε, καὶ ἰδοὺ Ἤλεὶ ἐκάθη-
το ἐπὶ τοῦ δίφρου παρὰ τὴν πύλην, σκοπεύων τὴν ὁδόν, ὅτι ἦν
ἡ καρδία αὑτοῦ ἐξεστηκυῖα περὶ τῆς κιβωτοῦ τοῦ Θεοῦ. Καὶ ὁ
ἄνθρωπος εἰσῆλθεν ἀπαγγεῖλαι εἰς τὴν πόλιν˙ καὶ ἀνεβόησεν ὅλη
14 ἡ πόλις. Καὶ ἤκουσεν Ἤλεὶ τὴν φωνὴν τῆς βοῆς, καὶ εἶπε˙ τίς
ἡ φωνὴ τῆς βοῆς ταύτης; Καὶ ὁ ἄνθρωπος σπεύσας εἰσῆλθε,
15 καὶ ἀπήγγειλε τῷ Ἤλεὶ. Καὶ Ἤλεὶ υἱὸς ὢν ἐνενήκοντα καὶ
ὀκτὼ ἐτῶν, καὶ οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὑτοῦ ἐπανέστησαν, καὶ οὐκ ἔβλε-
πε. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἤλεὶ τοῖς ἀνδράσι τοῖς περιεστηκόσιν αὑτῷ˙ τίς ἡ φωνὴ
16 τοῦ ἤχου τούτου; Καὶ ὁ ἀνὴρ σπεύσας προσῆλθε πρὸς Ἤλεὶ, καὶ εἶπεν
αὑτῷ˙ ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ ἥκων ἐκ τῆς παρεμβολῆς, καὶ ἐγὼ ἐκ τῆς
παρατάξεως πέφευγα σήμερον. Καὶ εἶπε˙ τί τὸ γεγονὸς ῥῆμα,
17 τέκνον; Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη τὸ παιδάριον, καὶ εἶπε˙ πέφευγεν ἀνὴρ Ἰσ-
ραὴλ ἐκ προσώπου ἀλλοφύλων, καὶ πληγὴ μεγάλη ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ
λαῷ, καὶ ἀμφότεροι οἱ υἱοί σου τεθνήκασιν, Ὀρνεὶ καὶ Φινεές,
18 καὶ ἡ κιβωτὸς τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐλήφθη. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἐμνήσθη τῆς

5 ...of the covenant of God, Ornei and Phinehas, were with the Ark. And it came to pass, when the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord came into the camp, that all Israel cried out with a great voice,
6 and the earth re-echoed. And the Philistines heard the voice of the crying, and the Philistines said, "What is this great voice of shouting in the camp of the Hebrews?"
7 And they knew that the Ark of the Lord was come into the camp. And the Philistines feared, and said, "These are the gods that are come unto them into the camp. Deliver us, O Lord, this day!
8 Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing yesterday nor the day before yesterday. Woe unto us!
9 Who shall deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods which smote Egypt with every plague, and in the wilderness. Be strong, O Philistines, and show yourselves to be men,
10 lest ye should become servants unto the Hebrews, as they have served us; and ye shall be as men, and fight against them." And they fought against them; and a man of Israel was smitten, and every man fled to his tent; and there was a very great slaughter, and there fell of Israel thirty thousand ranks.
11 And the Ark of God was taken, and both the sons of Eli died, Ornei and Phinehas.
12 And a Jemminite man ran out of the battle-line, and came to Shiloh on that day; and his garments were rent, and earth was upon his head.
13 And he came, and behold, Eli sat upon the seat by the gate, watching the way, for his heart was distraught concerning the Ark of God. And the man entered to declare [the news] into the city; and all the city cried out.
14 And Eli heard the voice of the crying out, and said, "What is the voice of this crying out?" And the man hastened and came in,
15 and declared [the news] unto Eli. Now Eli was ninety and eight years old, and his eyes had become uplifted, so that he could not see. And Eli said unto the men that stood round about him, "What is the voice of this sound?"
16 And the man hastened and came near unto Eli, and said unto him, "I am he that cometh out of the camp, and I myself have fled this day out of the battle-line."
17 And he said, "What is the word that is come to pass, my son?" And the young man answered and said, "Israel hath fled from before the Philistines, and there hath been a great slaughter among the people, and both thy sons are dead, Ornei and Phinehas,
18 and the Ark of God is taken." And it came to pass, when he made mention of the Ark of God,
