ΚΕΦ. ΚΒʹ. ΧΧΙΙ.
κατασχήσει δέ σοι δίκαιαν δικαιοσύνην, ἐπὶ δὲ δοὺς σου ἔσται φέγ-
29 γος. Ὅτι ἐταπείνωσεν ἑαυτὸν, καὶ ἐρεῖ [εἰ] ὑπερηφανεύσατο, καὶ
30 κύφοντα ὀφθαλμοῖς σώσει, ῥύσεται [δὲ] ἀθῶον· καὶ διασωθήσῃ ἐν
   καθαραῖς χερσί σου.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΓʹ. ΧΧΙΙΙ.

1.2 ὙΠΟΛΑΒΩΝ δὲ Ἰὼβ, λέγει· καὶ δὴ οἶδα ὅτι ἐκ χειρῶν
   μου ἡ ἔλεγξις ἐστιν· ἡ χεὶρ αὐτοῦ βαρεῖα γέγονεν [ἐπ᾿ ἐμοὶ] ἐπ᾿
3  ἐμῷ στεναγμῷ. Τίς γὰρ ἂν γνώη ὅτι εὕροιμι αὐτὸν, καὶ [ὅτι]
4  ἔλθοιμι εἰς τέλος; Εἴποιμι δὲ ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῦ κρῖμα, τὸ δὲ στόμα μου
5  ἐμπλήσαιμι ἐλέγχων. Γνώμην δὲ ῥήματα ἃ μοι ἐρεῖ, αἰσθοίμην δὲ
6  τίνα μοι ἀπαγγελεῖ. Καὶ εἰ ἐν πολλῇ ἰσχύϊ ἐπελεύσεται μοι; καὶ
7  εἰ ἐν ἀπειλῇ οὐ χρήσεται μοι; Ἀλήθεια γὰρ καὶ ἔλεγχος παρ᾿
8  αὐτῷ· ἐξαγάγοι δὲ εἰς τέλος τὸ κρῖμα μου. Ἐὰν γὰρ πορευθῶ
9  εἰς τὰ πρῶτα, οὐκέτι εἰμί· τὰ δὲ ἐπ᾿ ἐσχάτοις, τί οἶδα αὐτόν;
10 Ἀριστερὰ ποιήσαντος αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐ κατέσχον· περιβαλεῖ δεξιὰ,
11 καὶ οὐχ ὄψομαι. Οἶδε γὰρ ἤδη ὁδόν μου [αὐτὸς], καὶ διέκρινέ με
12 ὥσπερ χρυσίον. Ἐξελεύσομαι δὲ ἐν ἐντάλμασιν αὐτοῦ, ἐκράτησεν
13 ὁ ποὺς μου· ὁδοὺς γὰρ αὐτοῦ ἐφύλαξα, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἐκκλίνω ἀπὸ
14 ἐντολῶν αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐ μὴ παρέλθω, [ἵνα μὴ ἀποθάνω]· ἐν δὲ κόλ-
15 πῳ μου ἔκρυψα ῥήματα αὐτοῦ. Εἰ δὲ καὶ αὐτὸς ἔκρινεν οὕτως,
16 τίς ἐστιν ὁ ἀντερῶν αὐτῷ; ὁ γὰρ αὐτὸς ἠθέλησε, καὶ ἐποίησε.
17 Διὰ τοῦτο ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἐσπούδακεν, νουθετούμενος δὲ ἐφρόντισα αὐ-
18 τοῦ· ἐπὶ τούτῳ ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ κατασπουδασθῶ· κατανοή-
19 σω, καὶ πτοηθήσομαι ἐξ αὐτοῦ. Κύριος δέ [μου] ἐμαλάκυνε τὴν
20 καρδίαν μου, ὁ δὲ παντοκράτωρ ἐσπούδακεν [ἐπ᾿] ἐμέ· οὐ γὰρ ἤδειν,
21 ὅτι ἐπελεύσεταί μοι γνόφος, πρὸ προσώπου δέ μου καλύψει σκότος.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΔʹ. ΧΧΙV.

1  ΔΙΑΤΙ δὲ Κύριον οὐκ ἔλαβον ὧραι, ἀσεβεῖς δὲ [ἄνδρες] οὐκ
2  εἶδον ἡμέρας αὐτοῦ; Ὅριον [δὲ] ὑπερέβησαν, καὶ ποίμνιον σὺν
3  ποιμένι ἥρπασαν. Ὑποζύγιον [δὲ] ὀρφανῶν ἀπήγαγον, καὶ βοῦν
4  χήρας ἠνεχύρασαν, ἐξέκλινον δὲ ἀδυνάτους ἐξ ὁδοῦ δικαίας· ὁμο-
5  θυμαδὸν [δὲ] ἐκρύβησαν πραεῖς γῆς, καὶ ἀπέβησαν ὥσπερ ὄνοι ἐν

**28** and He shall establish for thee righteous righteousness, and upon him who hath given of thee, there shall be light.
**29** For he hath humbled himself, and he shall say, [whether] he hath boasted,
**30** and He shall save the one stooping with downcast eyes; and He shall deliver the innocent; and thou shalt be saved by thy pure hands.

## CHAPTER XXIII.

**1** Then Job answered and said:
**2** Yea, I know that my reproof is from my own hands; His hand hath become heavy [upon me] upon my groaning.
**3** For who would know that I might find Him, and [that] I might come unto the end [of the matter]?
**4** I would speak a judgment before Him, and my mouth would I fill with reproofs.
**5** And [I would have] discernment concerning the words which He shall speak unto me, and I would perceive what He shall declare unto me.
**6** And if in great might He shall come upon me? And if He shall not use threat against me?
**7** For truth and reproof are with Him;
**8** and He might bring my judgment to an end. For if I go to the former things, I am no longer [there];
**9** but as for the latter things, what know I of Him?
**10** When He hath acted on the left, I did not apprehend [it]; He shall turn to the right, and I shall not see [Him].
**11** For He already knoweth my way, [even He], and He hath distinguished me as gold.
**12** And I shall go forth in His commandments; my foot hath held fast.
**13** For I have kept His ways, and I will by no means turn aside from His commandments,
**14** and I will by no means transgress, [lest I die]; and in my bosom have I hid His words.
**15** But if He himself hath judged thus,
**16** who is he that will gainsay Him? For He himself willed, and He did it.
**17** Therefore hath he been anxious concerning Him, and being admonished, I have considered Him;
**18** upon this let me be greatly troubled before His presence;
**19** I will observe, and I shall be terrified by Him. But the Lord [my God] hath softened my heart,
**20** and the Almighty hath hastened [upon] me. For I knew not,
**21** that thick darkness would come upon me, and darkness shall cover me before my face.

## CHAPTER XXIV.

**1** Why then did the seasons not receive the Lord, and ungodly [men] not see His days?
**2** They have transgressed a boundary, and have seized a flock with its shepherd.
**3** And they have led away the orphan's beast of burden, and have taken the widow's ox as a pledge,
**4** and have turned the helpless out of the righteous way. And the meek of the earth have been hidden altogether,
**5** and they have gone away like wild asses in
