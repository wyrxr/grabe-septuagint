⁶ ἅγια τὰ ἐν τῇ σκηνῇ, καὶ ἀνήνεγκαν αὐτὴν οἱ ἱερεῖς καὶ οἱ Λευῖται. Καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς Σαλωμών, καὶ πᾶσα συναγωγὴ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ οἱ φοβούμενοι, καὶ οἱ ἐπισυνηγμένοι αὐτῶν ἔμπροσθεν τῆς κιβωτοῦ θύοντες μόσχους, καὶ πρόβατα, οἳ οὐκ ἀριθμήσονται, οὐδὲ 
⁷ λογισθήσονται ἀπὸ τοῦ πλήθους. Καὶ εἰσήνεγκαν οἱ ἱερεῖς τὴν κιβωτὸν διαθήκης Κυρίου εἰς τὸν τόπον αὐτῆς, εἰς τὸ Δαβεὶρ τοῦ οἴκου, εἰς τὰ ἅγια τῶν ἁγίων, ὑποκάτω τῶν πτερύγων τῶν Χε-
⁸ ρουβείμ. Καὶ ἦν τὰ Χερουβεὶμ διαπεπετακότα τὰς πτέρυγας αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τὸν τόπον τῆς κιβωτοῦ, καὶ συνεκάλυπτε τὰ Χερουβεὶμ 
⁹ ἐπὶ τὴν κιβωτόν, καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀναφορεῖς αὐτῆς ἐπάνωθεν, καὶ ὑπερεῖχον οἱ ἀναφορεῖς, καὶ ἐβλέποντο αἱ κεφαλαὶ τῶν ἀναφορέων ἐκ τῶν ἁγίων εἰς πρόσωπον τοῦ Δαβείρ, οὐκ ἐβλέποντο ἔξω, καὶ 
¹⁰ ἦσαν ἐκεῖ ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης. Οὐχ ἦν ἐν τῇ κιβωτῷ πλὴν δύο πλάκες ἃς ἔθηκε Μωϋσῆς ἐν Χωρήβ, ἃ διέθετο Κύριος μετὰ τῶν 
¹¹ υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, ἐν τῷ ἐξελθεῖν αὐτοὺς ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἐξελθεῖν τοὺς ἱερεῖς ἐκ τῶν ἁγίων, ὅτι πάντες οἱ ἱερεῖς οἱ εὑρεθέντες ἡγιάσθησαν, οὐχ ἦσαν διατεταγμένοι κατ᾿ ἐφημε-
¹² ρίαν. Καὶ οἱ Λευῖται οἱ ψαλτῳδοί, πάντες τοῖς υἱοῖς τῷ Ἀσάφ, τῷ Αἰμάν, τῷ Ἰδιθούν, καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς αὐτῶν, τῶν ἐνδεδυμένων στολὰς βυσσίνας ἐν κυμβάλοις, καὶ ἐν νάβλαις, καὶ ἐν κινύραις, ἑστηκότες κατὰ ἀνατολὰς τοῦ θυσιαστη-
¹³ ρίου, καὶ μετ᾿ αὐτῶν ἱερεῖς ἑκατὸν καὶ εἴκοσι σαλπίζοντες σάλπιγι. Καὶ ἐγένετο μία φωνὴ ἐν τῷ σαλπίζειν, καὶ ἐν τῷ ψαλτῳδεῖν, καὶ ἐν τῷ ἀναφωνεῖν φωνῇ μιᾷ τοῦ ἐξομολογεῖσθαι καὶ αἰνεῖν τῷ Κυρίῳ. καὶ ὡς ὑψώσαν τὴν φωνὴν ἐν σάλπιγι, καὶ ἐν κυμβάλοις, καὶ ἐν ὀργάνοις τῶν ᾠδῶν, καὶ ἔλεγον· ἐξομολογεῖσθε τῷ Κυρίῳ, ὅτι ἀγαθόν, ὅτι εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ὁ 
¹⁴ οἶκος ἐνεπλήσθη νεφέλης δόξης Κυρίου· καὶ οὐκ ἠδύναντο οἱ ἱερεῖς τοῦ στῆναι λειτουργεῖν ἀπὸ προσώπου τῆς νεφέλης (δόξης Κυρίου) ὅτι ἐνέπλησεν ἡ δόξα Κυρίου τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Θεοῦ.

**CHAPTER 5**

⁶ the holy vessels that were in the Tabernacle. And the priests and the Levites brought it up. And King Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, and those who feared [the Lord], and those of them who were gathered before the Ark, did sacrifice calves and sheep, which could not be numbered, neither could they be counted for the multitude [thereof].
⁷ Then the priests brought in the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord unto its place, into the Oracle of the House, even into the Most Holy Place, beneath the wings of the Cherubim.
⁸ For the Cherubim had spread forth their wings over the place of the Ark, and the Cherubim did cover the Ark,
⁹ and upon its staves from above. And the staves did project, and the ends of the staves were seen from the Holy Place before the Oracle, yet were they not seen without;
¹⁰ and they were there until this day. There was nothing in the Ark save the two tablets only, which Moses put there in Horeb,
¹¹ which the Lord made [covenant] with the children of Israel, when they came forth out of the land of Egypt. And it came to pass, when the priests came out of the Holy Place (for all the priests who were found [there] had consecrated themselves, and were not appointed by their courses),
¹² even the Levites who were musicians, all of the sons of Asaph, of Heman, and of Jeduthun, and their sons, and their brethren, clothed in garments of fine linen, with cymbals, with nabla-harps, and with lyres, standing eastward of the altar. And with them were one hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets.
¹³ And there was one sound as they blew with the trumpets, and sang psalms, and lifted up their voice with one accord to give thanks and to praise the Lord. And as they lifted up their voice with the trumpet, and with cymbals, and with instruments of song, they said: Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good, for His mercy endureth forever.
¹⁴ And the House was filled with a cloud of the glory of the Lord; so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud (the glory of the Lord); for the glory of the Lord had filled the House of God.

**CHAPTER 6**

¹ Then said Solomon: The Lord had said He would dwell in the thick darkness.
² But I have built a house for Thy Name, holy unto Thee, and [a place] prepared for Thee to abide in forever.
³ And the king turned his face, and blessed all the congregation of Israel.
