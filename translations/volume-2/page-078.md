ΚΕΦ. ς΄. VI.

1 ΚΑὶ συνήγαγεν ἔτι Δαυὶδ πάντα νεανίαν ἐξ ᾿Ισραήλ, ὡς ἑβδο-
2 μήκοντα χιλιάδας. Καὶ ἀνέστη Δαυίδ, καὶ ἐπορεύθη, καὶ πᾶς ὁ
  λαὸς ὁ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τῶν ἀρχόντων ᾿Ιούδα ἐν ἀναβάσει τοῦ ἀνά-
  γειν ἐκεῖθεν τὴν κιβωτὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ, ἐφ᾿ ἣν ἐπεκλήθη τὸ ὄνομα
  τοῦ Κυρίου τῶν δυνάμεων καθημένου ἐπὶ τῶν Χερουβεὶν ἐπ᾿ αὐ-
3 τῆς. Καὶ ἐπεβίβασαν τὴν κιβωτὸν Κυρίου ἐφ᾿ ἅμαξαν καινὴν καὶ
  ἦραν αὐτὴν ἐξ οἴκου ᾿Αμιναδὰβ τοῦ ἐν τῷ βουνῷ. Καὶ ᾿Αζὰ καὶ
  οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ υἱοὶ ᾿Αμιναδὰβ ἦγον τὴν ἅμαξαν τὴν καινήν,
4 καὶ ἦραν αὐτὴν ἀπὸ οἴκου ᾿Αμιναδὰβ ἐν βουνῷ σὺν τῇ κιβωτῷ
  τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ ἐπορεύοντο ἔμπροσθεν τῆς κιβω-
5 τοῦ. Καὶ Δαυὶδ οἱ υἱοὶ ᾿Ισραὴλ παίζοντες ἐνώπιον Κυρίου (καὶ)
  ἐν ὀργάνοις ἡρμοσμένοις (καὶ) ἐν ἰσχύϊ, καὶ ἐν ᾠδαῖς, καὶ ἐν κι-
  νύραις, καὶ ἐν νάβλαις, καὶ ἐν τυμπάνοις, καὶ ἐν κυμβάλοις, καὶ ἐν
6 αὐλοῖς. Καὶ παραγίνονται ἕως ἅλωνος Ναχών· καὶ ἐξέτεινεν ᾿Αζ-
  ζὰ τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν κιβωτὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ κατασχεῖν αὐτήν,
7 καὶ ἐκράτησεν αὐτήν, ὅτι περιέσπασεν αὐτὴν ὁ μόσχος. Καὶ ἐ-
  θυμώθη ὀργῇ Κύριος τῷ ᾿Αζζᾶ, καὶ ἔπαισεν αὐτὸν ἐκεῖ ὁ Θεὸς
  ἐπὶ προπετείᾳ, καὶ ἀπέθανεν ἐκεῖ παρὰ τὴν κιβωτὸν τοῦ Κυρίου
8 ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ. Καὶ ἠθύμησε Δαυὶδ ὑπὲρ οὗ διέκοψε Κύριος
  διακοπὴν ἐν τῷ ᾿Αζζᾶ· καὶ ἐκλήθη ὁ τόπος ἐκεῖνος, Διακοπὴ ᾿Αζ-
9 ζᾶ ἕως τῆς σήμερον ἡμέρας. Καὶ ἐφοβήθη Δαυὶδ τὸν Κύριον ἐν
  τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, λέγων· πῶς εἰσελεύσεται πρός με ἡ κιβωτὸς
10 τοῦ Κυρίου; Καὶ οὐκ ἐβούλετο Δαυὶδ τοῦ ἐκκλῖναι πρὸς αὐτὸν
  τὴν κιβωτὸν διαθήκης Κυρίου εἰς τὴν πόλιν Δαυίδ. Καὶ ἀπέκλι-
11 νεν αὐτὴν Δαυὶδ εἰς οἶκον ᾿Αβεδδαρὰ τοῦ Γεθθαίου, καὶ ἐκάθισεν
  ἐκεῖ γλωσσόκομον Κυρίου εἰς οἶκον ᾿Αβεδδαδὼμ τοῦ Γεθθαίου
  μῆνας τρεῖς· καὶ εὐλόγησε Κύριος τὸν ᾿Αβεδδαρὰ καὶ ὅλον τὸν
12 οἶκον αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἀπηγγέλη τῷ βασιλεῖ Δαυίδ, λέγοντες· εὐλό-
  γησε Κύριος τὸν οἶκον ᾿Αβεδδαρὰ καὶ πάντα τὰ αὐτοῦ ἕνεκεν τῆς
  κιβωτοῦ τοῦ Θεοῦ. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη Δαυίδ, καὶ ἀνήγαγε τὴν κιβω-
  τὸν τοῦ Κυρίου ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου ᾿Αβεδδαρὰ εἰς τὴν πόλιν Δαυὶδ ἐν
13 εὐφροσύνῃ. Καὶ ἦσαν μετ᾿ αὐτῶν αἴροντες τὴν κιβωτὸν ἑπτὰ χο-
14 ροί, καὶ θῦμα μόσχος καὶ ἄρνες. Καὶ Δαυὶδ ἀνεκρούετο ἐν ὀρ-

### Chapter 6

**1** And David gathered yet again all the young men of Israel, as seventy thousand.
**2** And David arose, and went, and all the people that were with him from among the rulers of Judah, in their ascent to bring up thence the Ark of God, upon which was invoked the Name of the Lord of Hosts, Who sitteth upon the Cherubim, even upon it.
**3** And they placed the Ark of the Lord upon a new cart, and bore it out of the house of Aminadab, who dwelt in the hill. And Azah and his brethren, the sons of Aminadab, drave the new cart,
**4** and they bore it from the house of Aminadab, that was in the hill, with the Ark of God; and his brethren went before the Ark.
**5** And David and the sons of Israel played before the Lord (and) with well-tuned instruments (and) with might, and with songs, and with lyres, and with lutes, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with pipes.
**6** And they came unto the threshing-floor of Nachon; and Azah stretched forth his hand unto the Ark of God to lay hold upon it,
**7** and he laid hold upon it; for the calf jolted it. And the Lord was wroth with Azah in His anger, and God smote him there for his presumption, and he died there by the Ark of the Lord before God.
**8** And David was grieved concerning that which the Lord had wrought a breaking upon Azah; and the name of that place was called, The Breaking of Azah, unto this present day.
**9** And David feared the Lord that day, saying, "How shall the Ark of the Lord come unto me?"
**10** And David would not turn aside unto himself the Ark of the covenant of the Lord into the City of David.
**11** But David turned it aside into the house of Abedara the Gittite, and he set there the Ark-chest of the Lord in the house of Abeddadom the Gittite for three months; and the Lord blessed Abedara and all his house.
**12** And it was told to King David, saying, "The Lord hath blessed the house of Abedara and all that he hath because of the Ark of God." And David went, and brought up the Ark of the Lord out of the house of Abedara into the City of David with joy.
**13** And there were with them, bearing the Ark, seven choruses, and a sacrifice of a calf and lambs.
**14** And David played upon [musical] instruments...
