ΚΕΦ. ΙΕ΄. ΙΕ΄. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Α΄. 511
οὕτω πικρὸς ὁ θάνατος; Καὶ εἶπε Σαμουὴλ πρὸς ᾿Αγὰγ· Καθότι ἠτέκνωσε γυναῖκας ἡ ῥομφαία σου, οὕτως ἀτεκνωθήσεται ἐκ γυναικῶν ἡ μήτηρ σου. Καὶ ἔσφαξε Σαμουὴλ τὸν ᾿Αγὰγ ἐνώπιον Κυρίου ἐν Γαλγάλ. Καὶ ἀπῆλθε Σαμουὴλ εἰς ᾿Αρμαθαίμ·
καὶ Σαοὺλ ἀνέβη εἰς οἶκον αὐτοῦ εἰς Γαβαά. Καὶ οὐ προσέθετο Σαμουὴλ ἔτι ἰδεῖν τὸν Σαοὺλ ἕως ἡμέρας θανάτου αὐτοῦ, ἔτι ἐπένθει Σαμουὴλ ἐπὶ Σαούλ, καὶ Κύριος μετεμελήθη ὅτι ἐβασίλευσε τὸν Σαοὺλ ἐπὶ ᾿Ισραήλ.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΕ΄. XVI.

ΚΑΙ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Σαμουὴλ· ἕως πότε σὺ πενθεῖς ἐπὶ Σαούλ, καὶ ἐγὼ ἐξουδένωκα αὐτόν, μὴ βασιλεύειν ἐπὶ ᾿Ισραήλ; πλήσον τὸ κέρας σου ἐλαίου, καὶ δεῦρο ἀποστείλω σε πρὸς ᾿Ιεσσαὶ ἔως Βηθλεέμ, ὅτι ἑώρακα ἐν τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ ἐμοὶ βασιλέα.
Καὶ εἶπε Σαμουὴλ· πῶς πορευθῶ; καὶ ἀκούσεται Σαούλ, καὶ ἀποκτενεῖ με. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος· δάμαλιν βοῶν λαβὲ ἐν τῇ χειρί σου, καὶ ἐρεῖς, θῦσαι τῷ Κυρίῳ ἥκω. Καὶ καλέσεις τὸν ᾿Ιεσσαὶ εἰς θυσίαν, καὶ γνωρίσω σοι ἃ ποιήσεις· καὶ χρίσεις ὃν ἐὰν εἴπω πρὸς σέ. Καὶ ἐποίησε Σαμουὴλ πάντα ἃ ἐλάλησεν αὐτῷ Κύριος. Καὶ ἦλθεν εἰς Βηθλεέμ, καὶ ἐξέστησαν οἱ πρεσβύτεροι τῆς πόλεως τῇ ἀπαντήσει αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπαν· εἰρήνη ἡ εἴσοδός σου, ὁ βλέπων; Καὶ εἶπεν· εἰρήνη· θῦσαι τῷ Κυρίῳ ἥκω, ἁγίασθητε καὶ εὐφράνθητε μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ σήμερον. Καὶ ἡγίασε τὸν ᾿Ιεσσαὶ καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐκάλεσεν αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν θυσίαν.
Καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐν τῷ εἰσιέναι αὐτούς, καὶ ἴδε τὸν ᾿Ελιάβ, καὶ εἶπεν· ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐνώπιον Κυρίου χριστὸς αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Σαμουήλ· μὴ ἐπιβλέψῃς ἐπὶ τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ, μηδὲ εἰς τὴν ἔξιν μεγέθους αὐτοῦ, ὅτι ἐξουδένωκα αὐτόν· ὅτι οὐχ ὡς ἐμβλέπεται ἄνθρωπος, ὄψεται ὁ Θεός· ὅτι ἄνθρωπος ὄψεται εἰς πρόσωπον, Θεὸς δὲ ὄψεται εἰς καρδίαν. Καὶ ἐκάλεσεν ᾿Ιεσσαὶ τὸν ᾿Αμιναδάβ, καὶ παρῆλθε κατὰ πρόσωπον Σαμουήλ, καὶ εἶπεν· οὐδὲ τοῦτον ἐξελέξατο Κύριος. Καὶ παρήγαγεν ᾿Ιεσσαὶ τὸν Σαμμά· καὶ εἶπε· καὶ ἐν τούτῳ οὐκ ἐξελέξατο Κύριος. Καὶ παρήγαγεν ᾿Ιεσσαὶ τοὺς ἑπτὰ υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ ἐνώπιον Σαμουήλ. Καὶ εἶπε Σαμουὴλ πρὸς ᾿Ιεσσαὶ· οὐκ ἐξελέξατο Κύριος ἐν τούτοις. Καὶ εἶπε Σαμουὴλ πρὸς

**1 Samuel 15**

33 "Is death so bitter?" And Samuel said unto Agag, "As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be made childless among women." And Samuel slaughtered Agag before the LORD in Gilgal.
34 And Samuel departed unto Ramah; and Saul went up unto his house [in] Gibeah.
35 And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death, for Samuel mourned for Saul; and the LORD repented that He had made Saul king over Israel.

**1 Samuel 16**

1 And the LORD said unto Samuel, "How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have spurned him from reigning over Israel? Fill thine horn with oil, and come, I will send thee to Jesse of Bethlehem, for I have seen among his sons a king for Myself."
2 And Samuel said, "How can I go? If Saul hear [of it], he will slay me." And the LORD said, "Take an heifer of the herd in thine hand, and thou shalt say, 'I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD.'"
3 "And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will make known to thee what thou shalt do; and thou shalt anoint him whomsoever I shall tell thee."
4 And Samuel did all that the LORD spake unto him. And he came to Bethlehem, and the elders of the city trembled at his coming, and said, "Comest thou peaceably, O Seer?"
5 And he said, "Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD. Sanctify yourselves and rejoice with me this day." And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.
6 And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, "Surely His Anointed is before the LORD."
7 And the LORD said unto Samuel, "Look not on his countenance, nor on the height of his stature; for I have spurned him: for [God] seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but God looketh on the heart."
8 Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, "Neither hath the LORD chosen this one."
9 And Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, "Neither hath the LORD chosen this one."
10 And Jesse made his seven sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, "The LORD hath not chosen [any] among these."
11 And Samuel said unto
