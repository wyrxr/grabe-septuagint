21 ἐβασίλευσεν ἐφ᾿ ἑαυτοῦ βασιλέα. Καὶ ἀνέβη Ἰωρὰμ εἰς Σιὼρ, καὶ
πάντα τὰ ἅρματα μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ. καὶ ἐγένετο αὐτοῦ ἀναστάντος νυ-
κτὸς, καὶ ἐπάταξε τὸν Ἐδὼμ τὸν κυκλώσαντα ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν, καὶ τοὺς
ἄρχοντας τῶν ἁρμάτων, καὶ ἔφυγεν ὁ λαὸς εἰς τὰ σκηνώματα αὐ-
22 τῶν. Καὶ ἠθέτησεν Ἐδὼμ ὑποκάτωθεν χειρὸς Ἰούδα ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας
23 ταύτης· τότε ἠθέτησε Λοβνὰ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ. Καὶ τὰ
λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Ἰωρὰμ, καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν, οὐκ ἰδοὺ ταῦ-
τα γέγραπται ἐπὶ βιβλίῳ λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν Ἰού-
24 δα; Καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Ἰωρὰμ μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐτάφη
μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ ἐν πόλει Δαυὶδ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ
25 ἐβασίλευσεν Ὀχοζίας υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ. Ἐν ἔτει δωδεκάτῳ
τῷ Ἰωρὰμ υἱῷ Ἀχαὰβ βασιλεῖ Ἰσραὴλ ἐβασίλευσεν Ὀχοζίας υἱὸς
26 Ἰωρὰμ βασιλέως Ἰούδα. Υἱὸς εἴκοσι καὶ δύο ἐτῶν ἦν Ὀχοζίας ἐν
τῷ βασιλεύειν αὐτὸν, καὶ ἐνιαυτὸν ἕνα ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ.
καὶ ὄνομα τῆς μητρὸς αὐτοῦ Γοθολία, θυγάτηρ Ἀμβρὶ βασιλέως
27 Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἐν ὁδῷ οἴκου Ἀχαὰβ, καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ πο-
νηρὸν ἐνώπιον Κυρίου, καθὼς ὁ οἶκος Ἀχαὰβ γαμβρὸς γὰρ οἴκου
28 Ἀχαὰβ ἐστί. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη μετὰ Ἰωρὰμ υἱοῦ Ἀχαὰβ εἰς πόλεμον
μετὰ Ἀζαὴλ βασιλέως ἀλλοφύλων ἐν Ῥαμὼθ Γαλαὰδ, καὶ
29 ἐπάταξαν οἱ Σύροι τὸν Ἰωράμ. Καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἰω-
ρὰμ (πρὸ) τοῦ ἰατρευθῆναι ἐν Ἰεζράελ ἀπὸ τῶν πληγῶν ὧν ἐπά-
ταξαν αὐτὸν οἱ Σύροι ἐν Ῥαμὼθ, ἐν τῷ πολεμεῖν αὐτὸν μετὰ Ἀζαὴλ
βασιλέως Συρίας, καὶ Ὀχοζίας υἱὸς Ἰωρὰμ βασιλεὺς Ἰούδα κα-
τέβη τοῦ ἰδεῖν τὸν Ἰωρὰμ υἱὸν Ἀχαὰβ εἰς Ἰεζράελ, ὅτι ἠρρώστει
αὐτός.

1 Καὶ Ἐλισσαιὲ ὁ προφήτης ἐκάλεσεν ἕνα τῶν υἱῶν τῶν προφη-
τῶν, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· Ζῶσαι τὴν ὀσφύν σου, καὶ λάβε τὸν φακὸν
τοῦ ἐλαίου τούτου ἐν τῇ χειρί σου, καὶ δεῦρο εἰς Ῥαμὼθ Γαλαάδ.
2 Καὶ εἰσελεύσῃ ἐκεῖ, καὶ ὄψῃ ἐκεῖ Ἰηοῦ, υἱὸν Ἰωσαφὰτ υἱοῦ Να-
μεσσὶ, καὶ εἰσελεύσῃ, καὶ ἀναστήσεις αὐτὸν ἐκ μέσου τῶν ἀδελφῶν
3 αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἰσάξεις αὐτὸν εἰς τὸ ταμεῖον ἐν τῷ ταμείῳ. Καὶ λή-
ψῃ τὸν φακὸν τοῦ ἐλαίου, καὶ ἐπιχεεῖς ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ,
καὶ εἶπον· τάδε λέγει Κύριος, κέχρικά σε εἰς βασιλέα ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ.
4 καὶ ἀνοίξεις τὴν θύραν, καὶ φεύξῃ, καὶ οὐ μενεῖς. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη

**CHAPTER EIGHT.**

**21** and made a king over themselves. And Joram went up to Seor, and all the chariots with him. And it came to pass, when he rose up by night, that he smote Edom who had surrounded him, and the captains of the chariots; and the people fled unto their tents.
**22** Thus Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah until this day. Then Lobna also revolted at that same time.
**23** Now the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, behold, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
**24** And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.
**25** In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab, king of Israel, did Ahaziah the son of Joram, king of Judah, begin to reign.
**26** Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And the name of his mother was Gotholia, the daughter of Ambri, king of Israel.
**27** And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, as did the house of Ahab; for he was son-in-law to the house of Ahab.
**28** And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to war with Hazael, king of the foreigners, in Ramoth-Gilead; and the Syrians smote Joram.
**29** And King Joram returned, (ere) he might be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him in Ramoth, when he fought with Hazael, king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Joram, king of Judah, went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.

**CHAPTER NINE.**

**1** And Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets, and said unto him, "Gird up thy loins, and take the lentil of this oil in thy hand, and go to Ramoth-Gilead.
**2** And when thou art come thither, thou shalt see Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Namessi; and thou shalt go in, and make him arise from among his brethren.
**3** And thou shalt bring him into the innermost chamber of the chamber. And thou shalt take the lentil of the oil, and pour it upon his head, and he said, 'Thus saith the Lord: I have anointed thee king over Israel.'
**4** And thou shalt open the door, and flee, and tarry not." And the lad went
