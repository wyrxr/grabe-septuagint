ΚΕΦ. ϛ΄. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Δ΄. 672
ριος, πόθεν σώσω σε; μὴ ἀπὸ τῆς ἅλωνος, ἢ ἀπὸ τῆς ληνοῦ;
28 Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ ὁ βασιλεύς· τί ἐστι σοι; καὶ εἶπεν· ἡ γυνὴ αὕτη
εἶπε πρός με, δὸς τὸν υἱόν σου, καὶ φαγόμεθα αὐτὸν σήμερον, καὶ
29 τὸν υἱόν μου φαγόμεθα αὔριον. Καὶ ἠψήσαμεν τὸν υἱόν μου, καὶ
ἐφάγομεν αὐτόν, καὶ εἶπον πρὸς αὐτὴν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ δευτέρᾳ· δὸς
τὸν υἱόν σου, καὶ φάγωμεν αὐτόν· καὶ ἔκρυψεν τὸν υἱὸν αὐτῆς.
30 Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἤκουσεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ τοὺς λόγους τῆς γυ-
ναικός, διέρρηξε τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ, καὶ αὐτὸς διεπορεύετο ἐπὶ τοῦ
τείχους, καὶ εἶδεν ὁ λαὸς τὸν σάκκον ἐπὶ τῆς σαρκὸς αὐτοῦ ἔ-
31 σωθεν. Καὶ εἶπε, τάδε ποιήσαι μοι ὁ Θεός, καὶ τάδε προσθείη, εἰ
32 στήσεται ἡ κεφαλὴ Ἑλισσαιὲ υἱοῦ Σαφὰτ ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ σήμερον. Καὶ
Ἑλισσαιὲ ἐκάθητο ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι ἐκάθηντο
μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ. καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ἄνδρα πρὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ, πρὶν ἐλ-
θεῖν τὸν ἄγγελον πρὸς αὐτόν· καὶ αὐτὸς εἶπε πρὸς τοὺς πρεσβυ-
τέρους· μὴ εἴδετε ὅτι ἀπέστειλεν ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ φονευτοῦ οὗτος ἀφε-
λεῖν τὴν κεφαλήν μου; εἴδετε ὡς ἂν ἔλθῃ ὁ ἄγγελος, ἀποκλείσατε
τὴν θύραν, καὶ παραβλύψατε αὐτὸν ἐν τῇ θύρᾳ· οὐχὶ φωνὴ τῶν
33 ποδῶν τοῦ κυρίου αὐτοῦ κατόπισθεν αὐτοῦ; Ἔτι αὐτοῦ λαλοῦντος
μετ᾿ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἰδοὺ ὁ ἄγγελος κατέβη πρὸς αὐτόν· καὶ εἶπεν,
ἰδοὺ αὕτη ἡ κακία παρὰ Κυρίου· τί ὑπομενῶ τῷ Κυρίῳ ἔτι;

ΚΕΦ. Ζ´. VII.

1 ΚΑΙ εἶπεν Ἑλισσαιέ· ἄκουσον λόγον Κυρίου· τάδε λέγει Κύ-
ριος, ὡς ἡ ὥρα αὕτη, αὔριον μέτρον σεμιδάλεως σίκλου, καὶ δί-
2 μετρον κριθῶν σίκλου ἐν ταῖς πύλαις Σαμαρείας. Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη ὁ
τριστάτης, ἐφ᾿ ὃν ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐπαναπαύετο ἐπὶ τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ,
πρὸς τὸν Ἑλισσαιέ, καὶ εἶπεν· ἰδοὺ ποιήσει Κύριος καταράκτας ἐν
οὐρανῷ, μὴ ἔσται τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο; καὶ Ἑλισσαιὲ εἶπεν· ἰδοὺ σὺ
3 ὄψῃ τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς σου, καὶ ἐκεῖθεν οὐ φάγῃ. Καὶ (ἰδοὺ) τέσσαρες
ἄνδρες ἦσαν λεπροὶ παρὰ τὴν θύραν τῆς πόλεως· καὶ εἶπεν ἀνὴρ
πρὸς τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ· τί ἡμεῖς καθήμεθα ὧδε ἕως ἀποθάνωμεν;
4 Ἐὰν εἴπωμεν, εἰσέλθωμεν εἰς τὴν πόλιν, καὶ ὁ λιμὸς ἐν τῇ πό-
λει, καὶ ἀποθανούμεθα ἐκεῖ· καὶ ἐὰν καθίσωμεν ὧδε, καὶ ἀποθα-
νούμεθα· καὶ νῦν δεῦτε, καὶ ἐμπέσωμεν εἰς τὴν παρεμβολὴν Συ-
ρίας· ἐὰν ζωογονήσωσιν ἡμᾶς, καὶ ζησόμεθα· καὶ ἐὰν θανατώσωσιν

**CHAPTER SIX.**

**27** Lord? Whence shall I save thee? [Shall it be] from the threshing floor, or from the winepress?"
**28** And the king said unto her, "What aileth thee?" And she answered, "This woman said unto me, 'Give thy son, that we may eat him today, and tomorrow we shall eat my son.'"
**29** "So we boiled my son, and did eat him; and I said unto her on the second day, 'Give thy son, that we may eat him'; but she hath hid her son."
**30** And it came to pass, when the king of Israel heard the words of the woman, that he rent his garments; and as he was walking upon the wall, the people beheld the sackcloth upon his flesh within.
**31** And he said, "God do so to me, and more also, if the head of Elisha, the son of Shaphat, shall stand upon him this day!"
**32** But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and [the king] sent a man before him; but ere the messenger came unto him, he said to the elders, "See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away my head? Behold, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door! Is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?"
**33** While he yet spake with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him; and he said, "Behold, this evil is from the Lord; why should I wait upon the Lord any longer?"

**CHAPTER SEVEN.**

**1** Then Elisha said, "Hear ye the word of the Lord: Thus saith the Lord, 'About this time tomorrow shall a measure of fine flour be [sold] for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gates of Samaria.'"
**2** Then the captain, on whose hand the king leaned, answered Elisha and said, "Behold, if the Lord would make windows in heaven, might this thing be?" And Elisha said, "Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not eat thereof."
**3** And [behold,] there were four leprous men at the entering of the gate; and one said unto his neighbour, "Why sit we here until we die?
**4** If we say, 'Let us enter into the city,' then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there; and if we sit here still, we shall die also. Now, therefore, come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they slay us,"
