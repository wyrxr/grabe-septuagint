ΚΕΦ. ΙΘʹ. Κʹ. ΤΩΝ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ ΙΟΥΔΑ Βʹ. 795
ὑμᾶς ὀργή, καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς ὑμῶν· οὕτως ποιήσετε, καὶ οὐχ
ἁμαρτήσεσθε. Καὶ ἰδοὺ Ἀμαρίας ὁ ἱερεὺς ἡγούμενος ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς εἰς 11
πάντα λόγον Κυρίου· καὶ Ζαβδίας υἱὸς Ἰσμαὴλ ὁ ἡγούμενος εἰς
οἶκον Ἰούδα πρὸς πάντα λόγον βασιλέως· καὶ οἱ γραμματεῖς, καὶ
οἱ Λευῖται πρὸ προσώπου ὑμῶν· ἰσχύσατε, καὶ ποιήσατε, καὶ ἔσται
Κύριος μετὰ τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. Κʹ. XX.

ΚΑΙ μετὰ ταῦτα ἦλθον οἱ υἱοὶ Ἀμμὼν, καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Μωὰβ, 1
καὶ μετ᾿ αὐτῶν ἐκ τῶν Μιναίων πρὸς Ἰωσαφὰτ εἰς πόλεμον, καὶ 2
ἦλθον καὶ ὑπέδειξαν τῷ Ἰωσαφάτ, λέγοντες· ἥκει ἐπὶ σὲ πλῆθος
πολὺ ἐκ τοῦ πέραν τῆς θαλάσσης ἀπὸ Συρίας, καὶ ἰδοὺ εἰσιν ἐν
Ἀσασὰν Θαμὰρ, αὕτη ἐστὶν Ἐγγαδδεί. Καὶ ἐφοβήθη, καὶ ἔδω- 3
κεν Ἰωσαφὰτ τὸ πρόσωπον αὑτοῦ ἐκζητῆσαι τὸν Κύριον, καὶ ἐκή-
ρυξε νηστείαν ἐν παντὶ Ἰούδᾳ. Καὶ συνήχθη Ἰούδας ἐκζητῆσαι 4
τὸν Κύριον, καὶ ἀπὸ πασῶν τῶν πόλεων Ἰούδα ἦλθον ζητῆσαι τὸν
Κύριον. Καὶ ἀνέστη Ἰωσαφὰτ ἐν ἐκκλησίᾳ Ἰούδα ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ, 5
ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου κατὰ πρόσωπον τῆς αὐλῆς τῆς καινῆς, καὶ εἶπε·
Κύριε ὁ Θεὸς τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν, οὐχὶ σὺ εἶ ὁ Θεὸς ἐν οὐρανῷ, 6
καὶ σὺ κυριεύεις πασῶν τῶν βασιλειῶν τῶν ἐθνῶν; καὶ ἐν τῇ χει-
ρί σου ἰσχὺς δυναστείας, καὶ οὐκ ἔστι πρὸς σὲ ἀντιστῆναι; Οὐχὶ 7
σὺ εἶ ὁ Θεὸς ὁ ἐξολεθρεύσας τοὺς κατοικοῦντας τὴν γῆν ταύτην
ἀπὸ προσώπου λαοῦ σου Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ ἔδωκας αὐτὴν σπέρματι Ἀ-
βραὰμ τῷ ἠγαπημένῳ σου εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα; Καὶ κατῴκησαν ἐν αὐ- 8
τῇ, καὶ ᾠκοδόμησαν ἐν αὐτῇ ἁγίασμα τῷ ὀνόματί σου, λέγοντες·
ἐὰν ἐπέλθῃ ἐφ᾿ ἡμᾶς κακὰ, ῥομφαία, κρίσις, θάνατος, λιμὸς, στη- 9
σόμεθα ἐναντίον τοῦ οἴκου τούτου καὶ ἐναντίον σου, ὅτι τὸ ὄνομά
σου ἐπὶ τῷ οἴκῳ τούτῳ, καὶ βοησόμεθα πρὸς σὲ ἀπὸ τῆς θλίψεως,
καὶ ἀκούσῃ καὶ σώσεις. Καὶ νῦν ἰδοὺ υἱοὶ Ἀμμὼν, καὶ Μωὰβ, καὶ 10
ὄρος Σηεὶρ εἰς οὓς οὐκ ἔδωκας τῷ Ἰσραὴλ διελθεῖν δι᾿ αὐτῶν, ἐλ-
θόντων αὐτῶν ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, ὅτι ἐξέκλιναν ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν, καὶ
οὐκ ἐξωλέθρευσαν αὐτούς· καὶ νῦν ἰδοὺ αὐτοὶ ἐπιχειροῦσιν ἐφ᾿ ἡμᾶς 11
ἐξελθεῖν ἐκβαλεῖν ἡμᾶς ἐκ τῆς κληρονομίας ἡμῶν, ἧς ἔδωκας ἡμῖν.
Κύριε ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν, οὐ κρινεῖς ἐν αὐτοῖς; ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν ἰσχὺς ἡ- 12
μῖν τοῦ ἀντιστῆναι πρὸς τὸ πλῆθος τὸ πολὺ τοῦτο τὸ ἐλθὸν ἐφ᾿

wrath upon you, nor upon your brethren. Thus shall ye do, and ye shall not sin.
¹¹ And, behold, Amariah the priest [shall be] chief over you in every matter of the Lord; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, in every matter of the king. And the scribes and the Levites [shall be] before your face. Be strong, and perform [your duty], and the Lord shall be with the good.

**Chapter 20**

¹ And it came to pass after this, that the children of Ammon, and the children of Moab, and with them some of the Minaeanites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle.
² Then there came [messengers] and informed Jehoshaphat, saying, "There cometh against thee a great multitude from beyond the sea, from Syria; and, behold, they are in Hasason Tamar, which is En Gedi."
³ And Jehoshaphat feared, and set his face to seek the Lord, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.
⁴ And Judah gathered themselves together to seek the Lord; even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the Lord.
⁵ And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah in Jerusalem, in the house of the Lord, before the new court, and said,
⁶ "O Lord God of our fathers, art Thou not God in Heaven? And dost Thou not rule over all the kingdoms of the nations? And in Thy hand is there not power and might, so that none is able to withstand Thee?
⁷ Art Thou not our God, who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before Thy people Israel, and didst give it to the seed of Abraham, Thy beloved, forever?
⁸ And they dwelt therein, and built Thee a sanctuary therein for Thy Name, saying,
⁹ 'If evil come upon us, a sword, or judgment, or pestilence, or famine, then shall we stand before this house, and before Thee — for Thy Name is in this house — and cry unto Thee out of our affliction, and Thou shalt hear and save.'
¹⁰ And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir, whom Thou didst not allow Israel to pass through when they came out of the land of Egypt, for they turned aside from them and did not destroy them:
¹¹ And now, behold, they assault us to come forth and to cast us out of Thy possession, which Thou hast given us as an inheritance.
¹² O our God, wilt Thou not judge them? For we have no might to stand against this great multitude that cometh against [us]."
