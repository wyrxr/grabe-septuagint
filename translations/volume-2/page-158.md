ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Γʹ. ΚΕΦ. ΙΓʹ.
ἀνθ’ ὧν παρεπίκρανας τὸ ῥῆμα Κυρίου, καὶ οὐκ ἐφύλαξας τὴν ἐν-
22 τολὴν ἣν ἐνετείλατό σοι Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου, καὶ ἐπέστρεψας, καὶ
ἔφαγες ἄρτον, καὶ ἔπιες ὕδωρ ἐν τῷ τόπῳ τούτῳ, ᾧ ἐλάλησε πρὸς
σέ, λέγων· Μὴ φάγῃς ἄρτον, καὶ μὴ πίῃς ὕδωρ, οὐ μὴ εἰσέλθῃ
23 τὸ σῶμά σου εἰς τὸν τάφον τῶν πατέρων σου. Καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ
τὸ φαγεῖν αὐτὸν ἄρτον, καὶ πιεῖν ὕδωρ, καὶ ἐπέσαξεν αὐτῷ τὴν ὄνον
24 τῷ προφήτῃ, καὶ ἐπέστρεψε, καὶ ἀπῆλθε. Καὶ εὗρεν αὐτὸν λέων
ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ, καὶ ἐθανάτωσεν αὐτόν· καὶ ἦν τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ ἐῤῥιμ-
μένον ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ, καὶ ὁ ὄνος εἰστήκει παρ’ αὐτὸ, καὶ ὁ λέων εἰστήκει
25 παρὰ τὸ σῶμα. Καὶ ἰδοὺ ἄνδρες παραπορευόμενοι, καὶ ἴδον τὸ θνη-
σιμαῖον ἐῤῥιμμένον ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ, καὶ ὁ λέων εἰστήκει ἐχόμενα τοῦ
θνησιμαίου· καὶ εἰσῆλθον, καὶ ἐλάλησαν ἐν τῇ πόλει οὗ ὁ προφή-
26 της ὁ πρεσβύτης κατῴκει ἐν αὐτῇ. Καὶ ἤκουσεν ὁ ἐπιστρέψας αὐ-
τὸν ἐκ τῆς ὁδοῦ, καὶ εἶπεν ὁ ἄνθρωπος τοῦ Θεοῦ· οὗτός ἐστιν
ὃς παρεπίκρανε τὸ ῥῆμα Κυρίου, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὸν ὁ Κύριος τῷ
λέοντι, καὶ συνέτριψεν αὐτὸν, καὶ ἐθανάτωσεν αὐτὸν κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα
27 Κυρίου, ὃ ἐλάλησεν αὐτῷ. Καὶ ἐλάλησεν πρὸς τοὺς υἱεῖς αὐτοῦ,
28 τῷ λέγειν· ἐπισάξατέ μοι τὴν ὄνον· καὶ ἐπέσαξαν. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη
καὶ εὗρε τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ ἐῤῥιμμένον ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ, καὶ ὄνος καὶ ὁ
λέων εἰστήκεισαν παρὰ τὸ σῶμα, καὶ οὐκ ἔφαγεν ὁ λέων τὸ σῶ-
29 μα τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ οὐ συνέτριψε τὸν ὄνον. Καὶ ἦ-
ρεν ὁ προφήτης τὸ σῶμα τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ ἐπέθηκεν
αὐτὸ ἐπὶ τὸν ὄνον, καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν αὐτὸν, καὶ ἦλθεν εἰς τὴν πό-
λιν τοῦ προφήτου τοῦ πρεσβυτέρου, τοῦ κόψασθαι καὶ τοῦ θάψαι
30 αὐτόν. Καὶ ἀνέπαυσε τὸ νεκρομαῖον αὐτοῦ ὁ προφήτης τοῦ θά-
ψαι αὐτὸν ἐν τῷ τάφῳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐκόψαντο αὐτὸν, οὐαὶ ἀδελφέ.
31 Καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ τὸ κόψασθαι αὐτὸν, καὶ εἶπε τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ,
λέγων· ἐὰν ἀποθάνω, θάψατέ με ἐν τῷ τάφῳ οὗ ὁ ἄνθρωπος τοῦ
Θεοῦ τέθαπται ἐν αὐτῷ, παρὰ τὰ ὀστᾶ αὐτοῦ θέτε με, ἵνα σωθῶ-
32 σι τὰ ὀστᾶ μου μετὰ τῶν ὀστῶν αὐτοῦ. Ὅτι γινόμενον ἔσται τὸ
ῥῆμα ὃ ἐλάλησεν ἐν λόγῳ Κυρίου ἐπὶ τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου τοῦ ἐν Βαι-
33 θὴλ, καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς οἴκους τοὺς ὑψηλοὺς τοὺς ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ. Καὶ
μετὰ τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο οὐκ ἐπέστρεψεν Ἱεροβοὰμ ἀπὸ τῆς κακίας
αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπέστρεψε καὶ ἐποίησεν ἐκ μέρους τοῦ λαοῦ ἱερεῖς
ὑψηλῶν· ὁ βουλόμενος ἐπλήρου τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐγένετο
34 ἱερεὺς εἰς τὰ ὑψηλά. Καὶ ἐγένετο τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο εἰς ἁμαρτί-

**21** because thou hast rebelled against the word of the LORD, and hast not kept the commandment which the LORD thy God commanded thee,
**22** but hast returned, and eaten bread, and drunk water in this place, concerning which He spake unto thee, saying, 'Thou shalt eat no bread, nor drink water;' thy body shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers."
**23** And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread and drunk water, that he saddled the ass for the prophet; and he turned, and departed.
**24** And a lion found him by the way, and slew him; and his body was cast forth in the way, and the ass stood by it, and the lion stood beside the body.
**25** And behold, men passed by, and they saw the dead body cast forth in the way, and the lion standing hard by the dead body; and they went and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.
**26** And when the prophet who had brought him back from the way heard thereof, he said, "This is the man of God, who rebelled against the word of the LORD: therefore the LORD hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the LORD, which He spake unto him."
**27** And he spake unto his sons, saying, "Saddle me the ass." And they saddled it.
**28** And he went and found his body cast forth in the way, and the ass and the lion stood by the body; and the lion had not eaten the body of the man of God, nor torn the ass.
**29** And the prophet took up the body of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and brought him back; and he came unto the city of the old prophet, to mourn and to bury him.
**30** And the prophet laid his dead body in his own sepulchre; and they mourned over him, crying, "Alas, my brother!"
**31** And it came to pass, after he had mourned over him, that he spake to his sons, saying, "When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones, that my bones may be preserved with his bones.
**32** For the word which he spake by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel, and against the houses of the high places which are in Samaria, shall surely come to pass."
**33** Yet after this thing Jeroboam turned not from his evil way, but returned and made again from the people priests of the high places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became a priest of the high places.
**34** And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, and for a destruction, and for an utter annihilation from the face of the earth.
