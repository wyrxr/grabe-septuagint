1 ΚΑΙ ἀπέστειλε Κύριος τὸν Νάθαν τὸν προφήτην πρὸς Δαυίδ,
  καὶ εἰσῆλθε πρὸς αὐτόν, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· Δύο ἄνδρες ἦσαν ἐν
2 πόλει μιᾷ, εἷς πλούσιος καὶ εἷς πένης. Καὶ τῷ πλουσίῳ ἦν ποι-
3 μνια καὶ βουκόλια πολλὰ σφόδρα. Καὶ τῷ πένητι οὐδὲν ἀλλ᾽ ἢ
  ἀμνὰς μία μικρά, ἣν ἐκτήσατο, καὶ περιεποιήσατο, καὶ ἐξέθρεψεν
  αὐτὴν καὶ ἠδρύνθη μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ καὶ μετὰ τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὸ
  αὐτό, ἐκ τοῦ ἄρτου αὐτοῦ ἤσθιε, καὶ ἐκ τοῦ ποτηρίου αὐτοῦ ἔπι-
  νε, καὶ ἐν τῷ κόλπῳ αὐτοῦ ἐκάθευδε, καὶ ἦν αὐτῷ ὡς θυγάτηρ.
4 Καὶ ἦλθε πάροδος τῷ ἀνδρὶ τῷ πλουσίῳ, καὶ ἐφείσατο λαβεῖν
  (αὐτὴν) ἐκ τῶν ποιμνίων αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐκ τῶν βουκολίων αὐτοῦ τοῦ
  ποιῆσαι τῷ ξένῳ τῷ ἐλθόντι πρὸς αὐτόν, καὶ ἔλαβε τὴν ἀμνάδα
  τοῦ πένητος, καὶ ἐποίησεν αὐτὴν τῷ ἀνδρὶ τῷ ἐλθόντι πρὸς αὐ-
5 τόν. Καὶ ἐθυμώθη ὀργῇ τῷ ἀνδρὶ σφόδρα Δαυίδ, καὶ εἶπε Δαυὶδ
  πρὸς Νάθαν· Ζῇ Κύριος, ὅτι υἱὸς θανάτου ὁ ἀνὴρ ὁ ποιήσας τοῦ-
6 το· καὶ τὴν ἀμνάδα ἀποτίσει τετραπλάσιον ἀνθ᾽ ὧν ὅτι ἐποίησε τὸ
7 ῥῆμα τοῦτο, καὶ περὶ οὗ οὐκ ἐφείσατο. Καὶ εἶπε Νάθαν πρὸς Δαυίδ·
  Σὺ εἶ ὁ ἀνὴρ ὁ ποιήσας τοῦτο. Τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσ-
  ραήλ· ᾽Εγώ εἰμι ὁ χρίσας σε εἰς βασιλέα ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐ-
8 γώ εἰμι ἐῤῥυσάμην σε ἐκ χειρὸς Σαούλ· καὶ ἔδωκά σοι τὸν οἶκον
  τοῦ κυρίου σου, καὶ ἐν τῷ κόλπῳ σου ἔδωκα τὰς γυναῖκας τοῦ
  κυρίου σου, καὶ ἔδωκά σοι τὸν οἶκον Ἰσραὴλ καὶ Ἰούδα· καὶ εἰ
9 μικρὸν ἐστι, προσθήσω σοι κατὰ ταῦτα. Τί ἐφαύλισας τὸν λόγον
  Κυρίου, τοῦ ποιῆσαι τὸ πονηρὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτοῦ; τὸν Οὐρίαν
  τὸν Χετταῖον ἐπάταξας ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ, καὶ τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ ἔλα-
  βες σεαυτῷ εἰς γυναῖκα, καὶ αὐτὸν ἀπέκτεινας ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ υἱῶν
10 ᾽Αμμών. Καὶ νῦν οὐκ ἀποστήσεται ῥομφαία ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου σου
  ἕως αἰῶνος· ἀνθ᾽ ὧν ὅτι ἐξουδένωσάς με, καὶ ἔλαβες τὴν γυναῖ-
11 κα τοῦ Οὐρίου τοῦ Χετταίου, τοῦ εἶναί σοι εἰς γυναῖκα. Τάδε λέ-
  γει Κύριος· Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐξεγείρω ἐπὶ σὲ κακὰ ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου σου,
  καὶ λήψομαι τὰς γυναῖκάς σου κατ᾽ ὀφθαλμούς σου, καὶ δώσω
  τῷ πλησίον σου, καὶ κοιμηθήσεται μετὰ τῶν γυναικῶν σου ἐναν-
12 τίον τοῦ ἡλίου τούτου· ὅτι σὺ ἐποίησας κρυβήδην, κἀγὼ ποιήσω
  τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο ἐναντίον παντὸς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἀπέναντι τούτου τοῦ

### Chapter 12

**1** And the LORD sent Nathan the prophet unto David, and he came unto him, and said unto him,

**2** There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor. The rich man had flocks and herds exceeding many.

**3** But the poor man had naught, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought, and did preserve, and did nourish it; and it thrived and grew strong with him, and with his children together. It did eat of his own morsel, and did drink of his own cup, and did lie in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.

**4** And there came a traveller unto the rich man; and he spared to take [one] of his own flocks and of his own herds, to make ready for the guest that was come unto him; but he took the poor man's lamb, and made it ready for the man that was come unto him.

**5** And David was greatly kindled with anger against the man, and he said unto Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this thing is a son of death;

**6** and he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because that he did this thing, and because he had no pity.

**7** And Nathan said unto David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I am He that anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;

**8** and I gave thee the house of thy master, and into thy bosom I gave the wives of thy master; and I gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if this were too little, I would have given unto thee yet more such things.

**9** Wherefore hast thou despised the word of the LORD, to do evil in His sight? Uriah the Hittite thou hast smitten with the sword, and his wife hast thou taken unto thee to be thy wife, and him hast thou slain with the sword of the children of Ammon.

**10** Now therefore, the sword shall never depart from thine house; because that thou hast despised Me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.

**11** Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house; and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.

**12** For thou didst this thing secretly; but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before this sun.
