¹ ἕως εἰς τέλος. Καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ ἕκαστος εἰς τὴν κληρονομίαν ἑαυτοῦ, καὶ εἰς τὰς πόλεις ἑαυτῶν.
² Καὶ ἔταξεν Ἑζεκίας τὰς ἐφημερίας τῶν ἱερέων καὶ τῶν Λευιτῶν, καὶ τὰς ἐφημερίας ἑκάστου κατὰ τὴν ἑαυτοῦ λειτουργίαν τοῖς ἱερεῦσι καὶ τοῖς Λευίταις εἰς τὴν ὁλοκαύτωσιν, καὶ εἰς τὴν θυσίαν τοῦ σωτηρίου, καὶ αἰνεῖν, καὶ ἐξομολογεῖσθαι, καὶ λειτουργεῖν ἐν ταῖς αὐλαῖς οἴκου Κυρίου·
³ καὶ μερὶς τοῦ βασιλέως ἐκ τῶν ὑπαρχόντων αὐτοῦ, εἰς τὰς ὁλοκαυτώσεις τὴν πρωϊνὴν καὶ τὴν δειλινήν, καὶ ὁλοκαυτώσεις εἰς σάββατα, καὶ εἰς τὰς νουμηνίας, καὶ εἰς τὰς ἑορτὰς τὰς γεγραμμένας ἐν τῷ νόμῳ Κυρίου.
⁴ Καὶ εἶπε τῷ λαῷ τοῖς κατοικούσιν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, δοῦναι τὴν μερίδα τῶν ἱερέων καὶ τῶν Λευιτῶν, ὅπως κατισχύσωσιν ἐν τῇ λειτουργίᾳ οἴκου Κυρίου.
⁵ Καὶ ὡς προσέταξε τὸν λόγον, ἐπλεόνασαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἀπαρχὴν σίτου, καὶ οἴνου, καὶ ἐλαίου, καὶ μέλιτος, καὶ πᾶν γέννημα ἀγροῦ, καὶ ἐπιδέκατα πάντα ἤνεγκαν εἰς πλῆθος οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ καὶ Ἰούδα.
⁶ Καὶ οἱ κατοικοῦντες ἐν ταῖς πόλεσιν Ἰούδα, καὶ αὐτοὶ ἤνεγκαν ἐπιδέκατα μόσχων καὶ προβάτων, καὶ ἐπιδέκατα αἰγῶν, καὶ ἠγίασαν τῷ Κυρίῳ Θεῷ ἑαυτῶν· καὶ εἰσήνεγκαν καὶ ἔθηκαν σωροὺς σωρούς.
⁷ Ἐν τῷ μηνὶ τῷ τρίτῳ ἤρξαντο οἱ σωροὶ θεμελιοῦσθαι,
⁸ καὶ ἐν τῷ ἑβδόμῳ μηνὶ συνετελέσθησαν. Καὶ ἦλθεν Ἑζεκίας καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες, καὶ εἶδον τοὺς σωρούς, καὶ ηὐλόγησαν τὸν Κύριον καὶ τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ Ἰσραήλ.
⁹ Καὶ ἐπυνθάνετο Ἑζεκίας τῶν ἱερέων καὶ τῶν Λευιτῶν ὑπὲρ τῶν σωρῶν.
¹⁰ Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτὸν Ἀζαρίας ὁ ἱερεὺς ὁ ἄρχων εἰς οἶκον Σαδώκ, καὶ εἶπεν· ἐξ οὗ ἤρκται ἡ ἀπαρχὴ φέρεσθαι εἰς οἶκον Κυρίου, ἐφάγομεν, καὶ ἐπίομεν, καὶ κατελείπομεν ἕως εἰς πλῆθος, ὅτι Κύριος ηὐλόγησε τὸν λαὸν ἑαυτοῦ,
¹¹ καὶ κατελίπομεν ἔτι τὸ πλῆθος τοῦτο. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἑζεκίας ἔτι ἑτοιμάσαι πασοφορία εἰς οἶκον Κυρίου· καὶ ἡτοίμασαν, καὶ εἰσήνεγκαν ἐκεῖ τὰς ἀπαρχάς, καὶ τὰ ἐπιδέκατα ἐν πίστει·
¹² καὶ ἐπ’ αὐτῶν ἐπιστάτης Χωνενίας ὁ Λευίτης, καὶ Σεμεὶ ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ διαδεχόμενος,
¹³ καὶ Ἰειήλ, καὶ Ὀζαζᾶς, καὶ Ναέθ, καὶ Ἀσαήλ, καὶ Ἰεριμώθ, καὶ Ἰωζαβάδ, καὶ Ἑλιήλ, καὶ Σαμαχία, καὶ Μαέθ, καὶ Βαναίας, καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ καθεσταμένοι διὰ Χωνενίου, καὶ Σεμεὶ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ, καθὼς προσέταξεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἑζεκίας,
¹⁴ καὶ Ἀζαρίας ὁ ἡγούμενος οἴκου Κυρίου. Καὶ Κωρὴ ὁ τοῦ Ἰεμνὰ ὁ Λευίτης, ὁ πυλωρὸς κατ’ ἀνατολὰς ἐπὶ τῶν δομάτων δοῦναι τὰς

² And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and of the Levites, even the courses of each man according to his own service, for the priests and for the Levites, for the burnt offering, and for the sacrifice of the peace offering, and to praise, and to give thanks, and to minister in the courts of the house of the Lord.

³ And a portion of the king's own substance [was appointed] for the burnt offerings: for the morning and the evening, and the burnt offerings for the Sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the feasts written in the law of the Lord.

⁴ And he spoke unto the people that dwelt in Jerusalem, to give the portion of the priests and of the Levites, that they might be established in the service of the house of the Lord.

⁶ And they that dwelt in the cities of Judah also brought tithes of calves and of sheep, and tithes of goats, and consecrated them unto the Lord their God; and they brought them and laid them up, heaps upon heaps.

⁷ In the third month they began to lay the foundations of the heaps, ⁸ and in the seventh month were they finished. And Hezekiah came and the princes, and they saw the heaps, and blessed the Lord and His people Israel.

⁹ And Hezekiah inquired of the priests and of the Levites concerning the heaps. ¹⁰ And Azariah the priest, the chief in the house of Zadok, said unto him, "Since the firstfruit began to be brought into the house of the Lord, we have eaten, and have drunk, and have left until a great abundance, because the Lord hath blessed His people, and we have left yet this great abundance."

¹¹ And Hezekiah said [unto them] further to prepare storerooms in the house of the Lord; and they prepared them, and brought in thither the firstfruits, and the tithes in faithfulness. ¹² And over them was Cononiah the Levite, the overseer, and Shimei his brother, next in order.
