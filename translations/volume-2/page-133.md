**28** τόπον οὗ ἂν ᾖ ὁ βασιλεύς, ἕκαστος κατὰ τὴν σύνταξιν αὐτοῦ.
**29** Καὶ ἔδωκε Κύριος σοφίαν τῷ Σαλωμών, καὶ φρόνησιν πολλὴν σφόδρα, καὶ χῦμα καρδίας, ὡς ἡ ἄμμος ἡ παρὰ τὴν θάλασσαν·
**30** καὶ ἐπληθύνθη ἡ σοφία Σαλωμὼν σφόδρα ὑπὲρ τὴν φρόνησιν πάντων ἀρχαίων ἀνθρώπων, καὶ ὑπὲρ πάντας φρονίμους Αἰγύπτου·
**31** καὶ ἐσοφίσατο ὑπὲρ πάντας τοὺς ἀνθρώπους, καὶ ἐσοφίσατο ὑπὲρ Γαιθὰν τὸν Ἐζραηλίτην, καὶ Ἡμὰν, καὶ τὸν Χαλχαλ, καὶ τὸν Δαραὰ, υἱοὺς Μαούλ· καὶ ἦν ὀνομαστὸς ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς ἔθνεσι κύκλῳ.
**32** Καὶ ἐλάλησε Σαλωμὼν τρισχιλίας παραβολὰς, καὶ ἦσαν ᾠδαὶ αὐτοῦ πεντακισχίλιαι·
**33** καὶ ἐλάλησε περὶ τῶν ξύλων ἀπὸ τῆς κέδρου τῆς ἐν τῷ Λιβάνῳ, καὶ ἕως τῆς ὑσσώπου τῆς ἐκπορευομένης διὰ τοῦ τοίχου, καὶ ἐλάλησε περὶ τῶν κτηνῶν, καὶ περὶ τῶν πετεινῶν, καὶ περὶ τῶν ἑρπετῶν, καὶ περὶ τῶν ἰχθύων.
**34** Καὶ παρεγίνοντο πάντες οἱ λαοὶ ἀκοῦσαι τῆς σοφίας Σαλωμὼν· καὶ παρὰ πάντων τῶν βασιλέων τῆς γῆς, ὅσοι ἤκουον τὴν σοφίαν αὐτοῦ.

**KΕΦ. Ε΄.**
**1** ΚΑΙ ἀπέστειλε Χειρὰμ βασιλεὺς Τύρου τοὺς παῖδας αὐτοῦ πρὸς Σαλωμών· ἤκουσε γὰρ ἔτι αὐτὸν ἔχρισαν εἰς βασιλέα ἀντὶ Δαυὶδ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ, ὅτι ἀγαπῶν ἦν Χειρὰμ τὸν Δαυὶδ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας.
**2** Kαὶ ἀπέστειλε Σαλωμὼν πρὸς Χειράμ, λέγων·
**3** σὺ οἶδας Δαυὶδ τὸν πατέρα μου, ὅτι οὐκ ἠδύνατο οἰκοδομῆσαι οἶκον τῷ ὀνόματι Κυρίου Θεοῦ μου ἀπὸ προσώπου τῶν πολέμων τῶν κυκλωσάντων αὐτὸν, ἕως τοῦ δοῦναι Κύριον αὐτοὺς ὑπὸ τὰ ἴχνη τῶν ποδῶν αὐτοῦ.
**4** Kαὶ νῦν ἀνέπαυσε Κύριος ὁ Θεός μου ἐμοὶ κυκλόθεν, οὐκ ἔστιν ἐπίβουλος, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἀπάντημα πονηρόν.
**5** Kαὶ ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ λέγω οἰκοδομῆσαι οἶκον τῷ ὀνόματι Κυρίου Θεοῦ μου, καθὼς ἐλάλησε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς πρὸς Δαυὶδ τὸν πατέρα μου, λέγων· ὁ υἱός σου ὃν δώσω ἀντὶ σοῦ ἐπὶ τὸν θρόνον σου, οὗτος οἰκοδομήσει τὸν οἶκον τῷ ὀνόματί μου.
**6** Kαὶ νῦν ἔντειλαι, καὶ κολυπάτωσάν μοι ξύλα ἐκ τοῦ Λιβάνου. Kαὶ ἰδοὺ οἱ δοῦλοί μου ἔστωσαν μετὰ τῶν δούλων σου, καὶ μισθὸν δουλείας σου δώσω σοι κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἂν εἴπῃς, ὅτι σὺ οἶδας, ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν ἡμῖν ἀνὴρ εἰδὼς κόπτειν ξύλα καθὼς οἱ Σιδώνιοι.
**7** Kαὶ ἐγενήθη καθὼς ἤκουσε Χειρὰμ τῶν λόγων Σαλωμών, ἐχάρη σφόδρα, καὶ

**28** place where the king might be, each according to his appointment.
**29** And the Lord gave unto Solomon wisdom, and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, as the sand that is on the seashore;
**30** And the wisdom of Solomon was increased exceedingly, above the understanding of all men of old, and above all the wise ones of Egypt;
**31** Yea, he was wiser than all men; and he was wiser than Gathan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalkhal, and Daraa, the sons of Maoul; and he was renowned among all the nations round about.
**32** And Solomon spoke three thousand proverbs, and his songs were five thousand.
**33** And he spoke of the trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that sprouteth out of the wall; he spoke also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes.
**34** And there came all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and from all the kings of the earth came those who had heard of his wisdom.

### Chapter 5

**1** And Hiram, king of Tyre, sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had yet heard that they had anointed him king in the stead of David his father; because Hiram had loved David all his days.
**2** And Solomon sent unto Hiram, saying,
**3** "Thou knowest David my father, that he could not build an house unto the Name of the Lord my God, because of the wars which were round about him, until the Lord should put them under the soles of his feet.
**4** And now the Lord my God hath given me rest on every side; there is no adversary, neither is there any evil encounter.
**5** And behold, I purpose to build an house unto the Name of the Lord my God, as the Lord God spake unto David my father, saying, 'Thy son, whom I shall set in thy stead upon thy throne, he shall build the house unto My Name.'
**6** And now command thou, and let them cut for me timbers out of Lebanon; and behold, my servants shall be with thy servants, and the wages for thy service will I give thee according to all that thou shalt say; for thou knowest that there is not among us any man skilled to cut timber like unto the Sidonians."
**7** And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced exceedingly, and
