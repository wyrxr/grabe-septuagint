ΚΕΦ. ΙΘʹ. Κʹ. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Βʹ. 585
τίον ἐπὶ τὸν Κύριόν μου τὸν βασιλέα; Ὡς βραχὺ διαβήσεται ὁ δοῦλός 36
σου τὸν Ἰορδάνην μετὰ τοῦ βασιλέως· καὶ ἵνατί ἀνταποδίδωσί μοι ὁ βα-
σιλεὺς τὴν ἀνταπόδοσιν ταύτην; καθισάτω δὴ ὁ δοῦλός σου, καὶ ἀποθα- 37
νοῦμαι ἐν τῇ πόλει μου, παρὰ τῷ τάφῳ τοῦ πατρός μου καὶ τῆς μητρός
μου. Καὶ ἰδοὺ ὁ δοῦλός σου Χαμαὰμ διαβήσεται μετὰ τοῦ κυρίου σου
τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ ποίησον αὐτῷ τὸ ἀγαθὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς μου.
Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεύς· μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ διαβήτω Χαμαάμ, κἀγὼ ποι- 38
ήσω αὐτῷ τὸ ἀγαθὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς σου, καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐκλέξῃ
ἐπ᾿ ἐμοί, ποιήσω σοι. Καὶ διέβη πᾶς ὁ λαὸς τὸν Ἰορδάνην, καὶ 39
ὁ βασιλεὺς διέβη, καὶ κατεφίλησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τὸν Βερζελλεί, καὶ
εὐλόγησεν αὐτόν, καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν εἰς τὸν τόπον αὐτοῦ. Καὶ διέβη 40
ὁ βασιλεὺς εἰς Γάλγαλα, καὶ Χαμαὰμ διέβη μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ
πᾶς ὁ λαὸς Ἰούδα διαβαίνοντες μετὰ τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ γε τὸ
ἥμισυ τοῦ λαοῦ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἰδοὺ πᾶς ἀνὴρ Ἰσραὴλ παρεγένον- 41
το πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα, καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα· τί ὅτι ἐκλε-
ψάν σε οἱ ἀδελφοὶ ἡμῶν ἀνὴρ Ἰούδα, καὶ διεβίβασαν τὸν βασιλέα
καὶ τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ τὸν Ἰορδάνην, καὶ πάντες ἄνδρες Δαυὶδ μετ᾿
αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη πᾶς ἀνὴρ Ἰούδα πρὸς ἄνδρα Ἰσραήλ, καὶ 42
εἶπαν· διότι ἐγγίζει ὁ βασιλεὺς (μου) πρὸς μέ· καὶ ἵνατί οὕτως ἐ-
θυμώθης περὶ τοῦ λόγου τούτου· μὴ βρώσει ἐφάγομεν ἐκ τοῦ βα-
σιλέως, ἢ δόμα δέδωκεν, ἢ ἄρσιν ἦρεν ἡμῖν; Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη ἀνὴρ 43
Ἰσραὴλ τῷ ἀνδρὶ Ἰούδα, καὶ εἶπε· δέκα χεῖρες μοι ἐν τῷ βασι-
λεῖ, καὶ πρωτότοκος ἐγὼ ἢ σύ, καὶ γε ἐν τῷ Δαυὶδ εἰμι ὑπὲρ σέ·
καὶ ἵνατί τοῦτο ὑβρίσας με, καὶ οὐκ ἐλογίσθη ὁ λόγος μου πρῶ-
τός μοι τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι τὸν βασιλέα ἐμοί; καὶ ἐσκληρύνθη ὁ λό-
γος ἀνδρὸς Ἰούδα ὑπὲρ τὸν λόγον ἀνδρὸς Ἰσραήλ.

ΚΕΦ. Κʹ. ΧΧ.

ΚΑΙ ἐπικαλούμενος ἐκεῖ υἱὸς παράνομος, καὶ ὄνομα αὐτῷ 1
Σαβεέ, υἱὸς Βοχορεί, ἀνὴρ ὁ Ἰεμινεί, καὶ ἐσάλπισεν ἐν τῇ κερατί-
νῃ, καὶ εἶπεν· οὐκ ἔστι μερὶς ἡμῖν ἐν Δαυίδ, οὐδὲ κληρονομία
ἡμῖν ἐν τῷ υἱῷ Ἰεσσαί. Ἀνὴρ εἰς τὰ σκηνώματά σου, Ἰσραήλ.
Καὶ ἀνέβη πᾶς ἀνὴρ Ἰσραὴλ ἀπὸ ὀπίσθεν Δαυὶδ ὀπίσω Σαβεὲ υἱοῦ 2
Βοχορεί. Καὶ ἀνὴρ Ἰούδα ἐκολλήθη τῷ βασιλεῖ αὐτῶν ἀπὸ τοῦ
Ἰορδάνου καὶ ἕως Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ εἰσῆλθε Δαυὶδ εἰς τὸν οἶκον 3

**19:35** ...[be] a burden upon my lord the King?

**36** For a little space shall thy servant pass over Jordan with the King; and wherefore should the King render unto me this recompense?

**37** Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back, that I may die in mine own city, by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold, thy servant Chimham, he shall pass over with my lord the King; and do thou to him that which is good in my sight.

**38** And the King said, 'Let Chimham go over with me, and I will do to him that which is good in thy sight; and whatsoever thou shalt desire of me, that will I do for thee.'

**39** And all the people passed over Jordan, and the King passed over; and the King kissed Barzillai, and blessed him, and he returned unto his own place.

**40** And the King went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him. And all the people of Judah crossed over with the King, and indeed, also half of the people of Israel.

**41** And behold, all the men of Israel came to the King, and they said unto the King, 'Why have our brethren, the men of Judah, stolen thee away, and have brought the King and his household across the Jordan, and all the men of David with him?'

**42** And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, and said, 'Because the King [my King] is near unto me; and wherefore are ye thus wroth concerning this matter? Have we eaten at all of the King, or hath he given us gifts, or hath he taken anything for himself from us?'

**43** And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, 'We have ten parts in the King, and I am the firstborn more than thou, and indeed, in David I am above thee. And why then hast thou disdained me, and was not my word accounted first, to bring back the King to me?' And the words of the men of Judah were harsher than the words of the men of Israel.

**CHAPTER 20**

**1** And there happened to be there a son of lawlessness, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite; and he blew a trumpet, and said, 'We have no portion in David, neither have we an inheritance in the son of Jesse. Every man to his tents, O Israel!'

**2** So every man of Israel went up from following David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri. But the men of Judah cleaved unto their King, from Jordan even to Jerusalem.

**3** And David came to his house in Jerusalem.
