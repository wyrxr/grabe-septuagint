καὶ Φαδαία ἀπὸ τῶν Λευιτῶν. καὶ ἐπὶ χεῖρα αὐτῶν Ἀνὰν υἱὸς
Ζαχούρ, υἱὸς Μαθθανίου, ὅτι πιστοὶ ἐλογίσθησαν ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς με-
14 ρίζειν τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς αὐτῶν. Μνήσθητί μου ὁ Θεὸς ἐν ταύτῃ, καὶ
15 μὴ ἐξαλειφθήτω ἔλεός μου ὃ ἐποίησα ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου Θεοῦ. Ἐν
    ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις ἴδον ἐν Ἰούδα πατοῦντας ληνοὺς ἐν σαββά-
    τῳ, καὶ φέροντας δράγματα, καὶ ἐπιγεμίζοντας ἐπὶ τοὺς ὄνους
    καὶ οἶνον καὶ σταφυλὴν καὶ σῦκα καὶ πᾶν βάσταγμα, καὶ φέροντας
    εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐν ἡμέρᾳ τοῦ σαββάτου˙ καὶ ἐπεμαρτυράμην ἐν
16 ἡμέρᾳ πράσεως αὐτῶν˙ καὶ ἐκάθισαν ἐν αὐτῇ φέροντες ἰχθῦν, καὶ
    πᾶσαν πρᾶσιν πωλοῦντες τῷ σαββάτῳ τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰούδα καὶ ἐν
17 Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ ἐμαχεσάμην τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰούδα τοῖς ἐλευθέροις,
    καὶ εἶπα αὐτοῖς˙ τίς ὁ λόγος οὗτος ὁ πονηρός, ὃν ὑμεῖς ποιεῖτε,
18 καὶ βεβηλοῦτε τὴν ἡμέραν τοῦ σαββάτου; Οὐχὶ οὕτως ἐποίησαν
    οἱ πατέρες ὑμῶν, καὶ ἤνεγκεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν καὶ ἐφ᾿
    ἡμᾶς πάντα τὰ κακὰ ταῦτα καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν πόλιν ταύτην; καὶ ὑμεῖς
19 προστίθετε ὀργὴν ἐπὶ Ἰσραὴλ βεβηλῶσαι τὸ σάββατον; Καὶ ἐγέ-
    νετο ἡνίκα κατέστησαν πύλαι ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ πρὸ τοῦ σαββάτου,
    καὶ εἶπα˙ καὶ ἔκλεισαν τὰς πύλας. καὶ εἶπα, ὥστε μὴ ἀνοιγῆναι
    αὐτὰς ἕως ὀπίσω τοῦ σαββάτου. καὶ ἐκ τῶν παιδαρίων μου ἔστη-
    σα ἐπὶ τὰς πύλας, ὥστε μὴ αἴρειν βαστάγματα ἐν ἡμέρᾳ τοῦ σαβ-
20 βάτου. Καὶ ηὐλίσθησαν πάντες, καὶ ἐποίησαν πρᾶσιν ἔξω Ἱερου-
21 σαλήμ ἅπαξ καὶ δίς˙ καὶ διεμαρτυράμην ἐν αὐτοῖς, καὶ εἶπα πρὸς
    αὐτούς˙ διὰ τί ὑμεῖς αὐλίζεσθε ἀπέναντι τοῦ τείχους; ἐὰν δευτε-
    ρώσητε, ἐκτενῶ τὴν χεῖρά μου ἐν ὑμῖν. ἀπὸ τοῦ καιροῦ ἐκείνου οὐκ
22 ἦλθοσαν ἐν σαββάτῳ. Καὶ εἶπα τοῖς Λευίταις, οἳ ἦσαν καθαριζό-
    μενοι, καὶ ἐρχόμενοι, φυλάσσοντες τὰς πύλας, ἁγιάζειν τὴν ἡμέ-
    ραν τοῦ σαββάτου. πρὸς ταῦτα μνήσθητί μου ὁ Θεός, καὶ φείσαι
23 μου κατὰ τὸ πλῆθος τοῦ ἐλέους σου˙ καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις
    ἴδον τοὺς Ἰουδαίους οἳ ἐκάθισαν γυναῖκας Ἀζωτίας, Ἀμμανίτι-
24 δας, Μωαβίτιδας, καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτῶν ἥμισυ λαλοῦντες Ἀζωτισί, καὶ
25 οὐκ εἰσὶν ἐπιγινώσκοντες λαλεῖν Ἰουδαϊστί. Καὶ ἐμαχεσάμην μετ᾿
    αὐτῶν, καὶ κατηρασάμην αὐτούς. καὶ ἐπάταξα ἐν αὐτοῖς ἄνδρας,
    καὶ ἐμαδάρωσα αὐτούς, ἐνώρκισα αὐτοὺς ἐν τῷ Θεῷ, ἂν δῶτε τὰς
    θυγατέρας ὑμῶν τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐὰν λάβητε ἀπὸ τῶν θυ-
26 γατέρων αὐτῶν τοῖς υἱοῖς ὑμῶν. Οὐχ οὕτως ἥμαρτε Σαλωμὼν
    βασιλεὺς Ἰσραήλ; καὶ ἐν ἔθνεσι πολλοῖς οὐκ ἦν βασιλεὺς ὅμοιος

#### NEHEMIAH CHAPTER XIII

<sup>13</sup> and of Pedaiah, one of the Levites. And under their charge was Anan, the son of Zachur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were accounted faithful to distribute unto their brethren.
<sup>14</sup> Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and let not my good deeds, which I have done within the House of the Lord God, be blotted out.

<sup>15</sup> In those days I saw in Judah men treading winepresses on the Sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and loading upon the donkeys both wine and grapes, and figs, and every [kind of] burden, and bringing them unto Jerusalem on the day of the Sabbath; and I protested against them on the day of their selling.
<sup>16</sup> Moreover, there had settled within her those who brought fish, and all [manner of] merchandise, selling it on the Sabbath unto the children of Judah and in Jerusalem.
<sup>17</sup> Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, "What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the day of the Sabbath?
<sup>18</sup> Did not your fathers thus, and our God brought upon them, and upon us, all these evils, and upon this city? And do ye yet add wrath upon Israel by profaning the Sabbath?"
<sup>19</sup> And it came to pass, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be overshadowed before the Sabbath, that I gave command, and they closed the gates. And I said that they should not be opened until after the Sabbath. And from among my servants I set men at the gates, so that no burdens might be brought in on the day of the Sabbath.
<sup>20</sup> And all lodged outside, and they traded outside Jerusalem once and again.
<sup>21</sup> And I solemnly testified unto them, and said unto them, "Wherefore do ye lodge over against the wall? If ye do this again, I shall lay my hand upon you." From that time they came not on the Sabbath.
<sup>22</sup> And I commanded the Levites, that they should purify themselves, and come to keep watch at the gates, to sanctify the Sabbath day. Concerning this also, remember me, O my God, and spare me according to the multitude of your mercy.

<sup>23</sup> In those days also I saw the Jews who had taken wives of Ashdod, Ammonite women, and Moabite women.
<sup>24</sup> And their children spake half in the language of Ashdod, and could not discern how to speak in the Jews' language.
<sup>25</sup> And I contended with them, and cursed them, and struck certain of them, and plucked off their hair. And I made them swear by God, [saying], "Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons."
<sup>26</sup> Was it not by such actions that Solomon, the king of Israel, did sin? And among many nations there was no king like unto him.
