ΚΕΦ. Ι´. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Γ´. 625
περὶ τῆς φρονήσεώς σου· καὶ οὐκ ἐπίστευσα τοῖς λαλοῦσί μοι, ἕως
οὗ παρεγενόμην, καὶ ἑωράκασιν οἱ ὀφθαλμοί μου· καὶ ἰδοὺ, οὐκ
ἔστι καθὼς ἀπήγγειλάν μοι τὸ ἥμισυ· προστέθεικας σοφίαν καὶ
ἀγαθὰ πρὸς αὐτὰ ἐπὶ πᾶσαν τὴν ἀκοὴν ἣν ἤκουσα ἐν τῇ γῇ μου.
Μακάριαι αἱ γυναῖκές σου, μακάριοι οἱ παῖδές σου οὗτοί εἰ παρα- 8
στήκοντες ἐνώπιόν σου διόλου, οἱ ἀκούοντες πᾶσαν τὴν φρόνησιν
σου. Γένοιτο Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου εὐλογημένος, ὃς ἠθέλησεν ἐν σοί, 9
δοῦναί σε ἐπὶ θρόνου Ἰσραήλ, διὰ τὸ ἀγαπᾶν Κύριον τὸν Ἰσραήλ,
στῆσαι εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα· καὶ ἔθετό σε βασιλέα ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς, τοῦ ποι-
εῖν κρίμα, καὶ δικαιοσύνην, καὶ ἐν κρίμασιν ἑαυτῶν. Καὶ ἔδωκε 10
τῷ Σαλωμὼν ἑκατὸν εἴκοσι τάλαντα χρυσίου, καὶ ἡδύσματα πολ-
λὰ σφόδρα, καὶ λίθον τίμιον· οὐκ ἐληλύθει κατὰ τὰ ἡδύσματα ἐ-
κεῖνα εἰς πλῆθος, ἃ ἔδωκε βασίλισσα Σαβὰ τῷ Σαλωμών. Καὶ 11
ἡ ναῦς Χειρὰμ ἡ αἴρουσα τὸ χρυσίον ἐκ Σουφείρ, ἤνεγκεν ἐκ Σου-
φείρ ξύλα ἀπελέκητα πολλὰ σφόδρα, καὶ λίθον τίμιον. Καὶ ἐποί- 12
ησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τὰ ξύλα τὰ ἀπελέκητα ὑποστηρίγματα τοῦ οἴκου
Κυρίου, καὶ τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ κινύρας, καὶ νάβλας τοῖς
ᾠδοῖς· οὐκ ἐληλύθει τοιαῦτα ξύλα που ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης.
Καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς Σαλωμὼν ἔδωκε τῇ βασιλίσσῃ Σαβὰ πάντα ὅσα 13
ἠθέλησεν, ὅσα ἠτήσατο, ἐκτὸς πάντων ὧν ἐδεδώκει αὐτῇ διὰ χει-
ρὸς τοῦ βασιλέως Σαλωμών· καὶ ἀπεστράφη, καὶ ἦλθεν εἰς τὴν
γῆν αὐτῆς, καὶ πάντες οἱ παῖδες αὐτῆς. Καὶ ἦν σταθμὸς τοῦ 14
χρυσίου τοῦ ἐληλυθότος τῷ Σαλωμὼν ἐν ἐνιαυτῷ ἑνὶ ἑξακόσια ἑ-
ξηκονταέξ τάλαντα χρυσίου, χωρὶς τῶν φόρων τῶν ὑποτεταγμέ- 15
νων, καὶ τῶν ἐμπόρων τῶν ἐμποπωλῶν, καὶ πάντων τῶν βασιλέ-
ων τῶν πέραν, καὶ τῶν σατραπῶν τῆς γῆς. Καὶ ἐποίησεν ὁ βα- 16
σιλεὺς Σαλωμὼν τριακόσια δόρατα, χρυσᾶ, ἐλατὰ· τριακόσιοι χρυ-
σοῖ ἔπησαν ἐπὶ τὸ δόρυ τὸ ἕν. Καὶ τριακόσια ὅπλα ἐλατὰ· καὶ 17
τρεῖς μναῖ χρυσίου ἐνῆσαν εἰς τὸ ὅπλον τὸ ἕν· καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὰ
ὁ βασιλεὺς εἰς οἶκον δρυμοῦ τοῦ Λιβάνου. Καὶ ἐποίησεν ὁ βα- 18
σιλεὺς θρόνον ἐλεφάντινον μέγαν, καὶ περιεχρύσωσεν αὐτὸν χρυσίῳ
δοκίμῳ. Ἕξ ἀναβαθμοὶ τῷ θρόνῳ, καὶ προτομαὶ μόσχων τῷ 19
θρόνῳ ἐκ τῶν ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ, καὶ χεῖρες ἐπὶ τοῦ θρόνου, ἔνθεν καὶ
ἔνθεν ἐπὶ τοῦ θρόνου τῆς καθέδρας, καὶ δύο λέοντες ἑστῶτες ἐ- 20
κεῖ ἐπὶ τῶν ἕξ ἀναβαθμῶν ἔνθεν καὶ ἔνθεν· οὐ γέγονεν οὕτω πά-
σῃ βασιλείᾳ. Καὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη τοῦ ποτοῦ τοῦ βασιλέως Σα- 21

#### CHAPTER 10

**7** ...concerning thy wisdom. And I believed not the words of them that told me, until I came, and mine eyes beheld it. And lo, not even the half was told me; thou hast added wisdom and good things thereto, beyond all the fame which I heard in my own land.
**8** Blessed are thy wives, and blessed are these thy servants, which stand before thee continually, and hear all thy wisdom.
**9** Blessed be the Lord thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel, because the Lord loveth Israel, to establish it forever: and hath made thee king over them, to do judgment and righteousness, and in their own judgments.
**10** And she gave King Solomon an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices in great abundance, and precious stones: there never came such an abundance of spices as those which the Queen of Sheba gave to Solomon.
**11** And the fleet of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought from Ophir much unhewn wood, and precious stones.
**12** And the king made of the unhewn wood supports for the House of the Lord, and for the king’s house, and harps, and psalteries for the singers; neither was there seen any such wood anywhere, nor had it been brought, until this day.
**13** And King Solomon gave unto the Queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside all that he had given her by the hand of King Solomon. And she turned, and went to her own land, she and all her servants.
**14** Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred sixty-six talents of gold,
**15** Beside that which came of the custom-tributes, and of the merchantmen, and of the traffickers, and of all the kings of the regions beyond, and of the satraps of the land.
**16** And King Solomon made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three hundred [shekels] of gold were laid upon each shield.
**17** And three hundred bucklers of beaten gold; and three minae of gold went into each buckler: and the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.
**18** Moreover, the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the purest gold.
**19** Six steps led up to the throne, and carvings of calves were at the back of the throne, and armrests on the throne, on either side, [even] on the throne of the seat.
**20** And two lions stood there upon the six steps, on either side. There was no such [throne] made in any kingdom.
**21** And all King Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the basins were of pure gold; there was no silver, for it was not accounted of in the days of Solomon for anything at all.
