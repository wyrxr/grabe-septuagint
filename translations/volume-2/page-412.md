Ἰουδαῖοι ἐν Σούσοις τῇ τεσσαρεσκαιδεκάτῃ τοῦ Ἀδάρ, καὶ ἀπ-
16 ἔκτειναν ἄνδρας τριακοσίους, καὶ οὐδὲν διήρπασαν. Οἱ δὲ λοιποὶ
τῶν Ἰουδαίων οἱ ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ συναχθέντες ἑαυτοῖς ἐβοήθουν,
καὶ ἀνεπαύσαντο ἀπὸ τῶν πολεμίων· ἀπώλεσαν γὰρ αὐτῶν μυρίους
πεντακισχιλίους τῇ τρισκαιδεκάτῃ τοῦ Ἀδάρ, καὶ τῇ τεσσαρεσκαι-
17 δεκάτῃ τοῦ αὐτοῦ μηνός, καὶ οὐδὲν διήρπασαν. Καὶ ἀνεπαύσαντο
τῇ τεσσαρεσκαιδεκάτῃ τοῦ αὐτοῦ μηνός, καὶ ἦγον αὐτὴν ἡμέραν
18 ἀναπαύσεως μετὰ χαρᾶς καὶ εὐφροσύνης. Οἱ δὲ Ἰουδαῖοι ἐν Σού-
σοις τῇ πόλει συνήχθησαν καὶ τῇ τεσσαρεσκαιδεκάτῃ, καὶ ἀνεπαύ-
σαντο· ἦγον δὲ καὶ τὴν πεντεκαιδεκάτην μετὰ χαρᾶς καὶ εὐφρο-
19 σύνης. Διὰ γὰρ τοῦτο οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι διεσπαρμένοι ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ τῇ
ἔξω, ἄγουσι καὶ τὴν τεσσαρεσκαιδεκάτην τοῦ Ἀδὰρ ἡμέραν ἀγα-
θὴν μετὰ εὐφροσύνης, ἀποστέλλοντες μερίδας ἕκαστος τῷ πλη-
σίον· οἱ δὲ κατοικοῦντες ἐν ταῖς μητροπόλεσι καὶ τὴν πεντεκαιδε-
κάτην τοῦ Ἀδὰρ ἡμέραν εὐφροσύνης ἀγαθὴν ἄγουσιν, ἐξαποστέλ-
20 λοντες μερίδας τοῖς πλησίον. Ἔγραψε δὲ Μαρδοχαῖος τοὺς λό-
γους τούτους εἰς βιβλίον, καὶ ἀπέστειλε τοῖς Ἰουδαίοις, οἳ ἦσαν
21 ἐν τῇ Ἀρταξέρξου βασιλείᾳ τοῖς ἐγγὺς καὶ τοῖς μακράν, στῆσαι
τὰς ἡμέρας ταύτας ἀγαθάς, ἄγειν τε τὴν τεσσαρεσκαιδεκάτην καὶ
22 τὴν πεντεκαιδεκάτην τοῦ Ἀδάρ. Ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις αἷς ἀνεπαύσαν-
το οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι ἀπὸ τῶν ἐχθρῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ τὸν μῆνα, ἐν ᾧ ἐγράφη
αὐτοῖς, ἀπὸ ὀδύνης εἰς χαράν, καὶ ἀπὸ πένθους εἰς ἀγαθὴν ἡμέ-
ραν, ἄγειν αὐτὰς ἡμέρας γάμων καὶ εὐφροσύνης, ἐξαποστέλλοντες
23 μερίδας τοῖς φίλοις καὶ τοῖς πτωχοῖς. Καὶ προσεδέξαντο οἱ Ἰου-
24 δαῖοι, καθὼς ἔγραψεν αὐτοῖς Μαρδοχαῖος. Ὅπως Ἀμὰν Ἀμαδα-
θοῦ ὁ Μακεδὼν ἐπολέμει τοὺς Ἰουδαίους, καὶ ὡς ἔθετο ψήφισμα
25 καὶ κλῆρον ἀπολέσαι αὐτούς, καὶ ὡς εἰσῆλθε πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα λέ-
γων κρεμάσαι τὸν Μαρδοχαῖον· ὅσα δὲ ἐπεχείρησεν ἐπάξαι τοῖς
Ἰουδαίοις κακά, ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸν ἐγένετο, καὶ ἐκρεμάσθη αὐτός, καὶ τὰ
26 τέκνα αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τῶν ξύλων. Διὰ τοῦτο ἐπεκλήθησαν αἱ ἡμέραι
αὗται Φρουραὶ διὰ τοὺς κλήρους, ὅτι καλοῦνται τῇ διαλέκτῳ αὐ-
τῶν Φρουραί, διὰ τοὺς λόγους τῆς ἐπιστολῆς ταύτης, καὶ ὅσα πε-
27 πόνθασι διὰ ταῦτα, καὶ ὅσα αὐτοῖς ἐγένετο, καὶ ἔστησεν καὶ ὡς
προσεδέχοντο οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι ἐφ᾽ ἑαυτοῖς, καὶ ἐπὶ τῷ σπέρματι αὐ-
τῶν, καὶ ἐπὶ τοῖς προστεθειμένοις ἐφ᾽ ἑαυτῶν, οὐδὲ μὴν ἄλλως
χρήσονται. αἱ δὲ ἡμέραι αὗται μνημόσυναι ἐπιτελούμεναι κατὰ

**Chapter 9**

<sup>15</sup> ...[were gathered]. And the Jews that were in Susa, on the fourteenth day of Adar, slew three hundred men; yet did they take no spoil.

<sup>16</sup> But the rest of the Jews that were in the king's provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies; for they slew of their foes fifteen thousand men on the thirteenth day of Adar, and on the fourteenth day of the same month, yet did they take no spoil. <sup>17</sup> And they rested on the fourteenth day of the same month, and they kept it a day of rest with joy and gladness. <sup>18</sup> But the Jews that were in the city of Susa gathered themselves together also on the fourteenth day, and had rest; and they kept the fifteenth day also with joy and gladness.

<sup>19</sup> Therefore, the Jews that were dispersed in the country outside, do keep also the fourteenth day of Adar as a good day with gladness, sending portions each to his neighbor; but they that dwell in the metropolitan cities do keep also the fifteenth day of Adar as a good day of gladness, sending portions unto their neighbors.

<sup>20</sup> And Mordecai wrote these words in a book, and sent [them] unto all the Jews who were in the kingdom of Artaxerxes, both nigh and far off, <sup>21</sup> to establish these days as good [days], and to keep the fourteenth day and the fifteenth day of Adar. <sup>22</sup> Even as in those days when the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from anguish into joy, and from mourning into a good day; that they should keep them as days of nuptial feasts and gladness, sending portions unto friends and unto the poor. <sup>23</sup> And the Jews accepted [this], according as Mordecai had written unto them.

<sup>24</sup> How Haman, the son of Hammedatha, the Macedonian, made war against the Jews, and how he set forth a decree and a lot to destroy them; <sup>25</sup> and how he came in unto the king, saying that Mordecai should be hanged; but whatsoever evils he attempted to bring upon the Jews, [these] came upon his own head; and he himself was hanged, and his children upon the gallows.

<sup>26</sup> For this cause these days were called Purim [Φρουραὶ], because of the lots, for they are called Purim [Φρουραί] in their dialect; according to the words of this epistle, and according to all that they had suffered thereby, and all that had befallen them. <sup>27</sup> And [Mordecai] established [these days], and as the Jews accepted [them] for themselves, and for their seed, and for all those that were added unto them, nor indeed shall they make use [of these days] otherwise. But these days [shall be] memorials, to be celebrated throughout...
