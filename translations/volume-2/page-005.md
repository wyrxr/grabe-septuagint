1 Καὶ ἐγένετο ἄνθρωπος εἷς ἐξ Ἀρμαθαΐμ Σωφίμ, ἐξ ὄρους Ἐφραίμ, καὶ ὄνομα αὐτῷ Ἐλκανᾶ, υἱὸς Ἰεροάμ, υἱοῦ Ἐλιοῦ, υἱοῦ Σούπ, υἱοῦ Σούπ, Ἐφραθαῖος.
2 Καὶ τούτῳ δύο γυναῖκες· ὄνομα τῇ μιᾷ, Ἄννα· καὶ ὄνομα τῇ δευτέρᾳ, Φεννάνα. Καὶ ἦν τῇ Φεννάνᾳ παιδία· τῇ δὲ Ἄννᾳ οὐκ ἦν παιδίον.
3 Καὶ ἀνέβαινεν ὁ ἄνθρωπος ἐκεῖνος ἐκ πόλεως αὐτοῦ ἐξ Ἀρμαθαΐμ ἐξ ἡμερῶν εἰς ἡμέρας, προσκυνεῖν καὶ θύειν Κυρίῳ Θεῷ σαβαὼθ ἐν Σηλώ· καὶ ἐκεῖ Ἠλεὶ καὶ δύο υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ, Ὄφνεὶ καὶ Φινεές, ἱερεῖς τοῦ Κυρίου.
4 Καὶ ἐγενήθη ἡμέρα, καὶ ἔθυσεν Ἐλκανᾶ, καὶ ἔδωκε τῇ Φεννάνᾳ γυναικὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτῆς, καὶ ταῖς θυγατράσιν αὐτῆς, μερίδας· καὶ τῇ Ἄννᾳ ἔδωκε μερίδα μίαν, ὅτι οὐκ ἦν αὐτῇ παιδίον.
5 πλὴν ἐπεὶ τὴν Ἄνναν ἠγάπα Ἐλκανᾶ ὑπὲρ ταύτην. Καὶ ὁ Κύριος συναπέκλεισε τὰ περὶ τὴν μήτραν αὐτῆς, ὅτι οὐκ ἔδωκεν αὐτῇ Κύριος παιδίον κατὰ τὴν θλῖψιν αὐτῆς, καὶ κατὰ
6 τὴν ἀθυμίαν τῆς θλίψεως αὐτῆς, καὶ ἠθύμει διὰ τοῦτο, ὅτι συναπέκλεισε Κύριος τὰ περὶ τὴν μήτραν αὐτῆς, τοῦ μὴ δοῦναι αὐτῇ παιδίον.
7 Καὶ οὕτως ἐποίει ἐνιαυτὸν κατ᾿ ἐνιαυτόν, ἐν τῷ ἀναβαίνειν αὐτὴν εἰς οἶκον Κυρίου· καὶ ἠθύμει, καὶ ἔκλαιε, καὶ οὐκ ἤσθιε.
8 Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ Ἐλκανᾶ ὁ ἀνὴρ αὐτῆς· Ἄννα. Καὶ εἶπεν· ἰδοὺ ἐγώ. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ· τί ἐστί σοι ὅτι κλαίεις; καὶ διατὶ οὐκ ἐσθίεις; καὶ ἵνατί τύπτει σε ἡ καρδία σου; οὐκ ἐγὼ (εἰμι) ἀγαθός σοι ὑπὲρ δέκα τέκνα;
9 Καὶ ἀνέστη Ἄννα μετὰ τὸ φαγεῖν αὐτοὺς ἐν Σηλὼ καὶ μετὰ τὸ πιεῖν, καὶ κατέστη ἐνώπιον Κυρίου· καὶ Ἠλεὶ ὁ ἱερεὺς ἐκάθητο ἐπὶ τοῦ δίφρου ἐπὶ τῶν φλιῶν ναοῦ Κυρίου.
10 Καὶ αὐτὴ κατώδυνος ψυχῇ, καὶ προσηύξατο πρὸς Κύριον καὶ κλαίουσα ἔκλαυσε.
11 Καὶ ηὔξατο εὐχὴν τῷ Κυρίῳ, λέγουσα.

**First [Book] of Kingdoms**
**Chapter 1**

1 Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-Zophim, from the hill country of Ephraim; and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Suph, the son of Suph, an Ephrathite.

2 And to him were two wives: the name of the one was Anna, and the name of the second was Peninnah. And Peninnah had children; but Anna had no child.

3 And this man went up from his city, from Ramathaim, from year to year, to worship and to sacrifice unto the Lord God of Sabaoth in Shiloh. And there were Eli and his two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the Lord.

4 And when the day came that Elkanah did sacrifice, he gave portions unto Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons, and to her daughters.

5 But unto Anna he gave one portion, for she had no child. Howbeit Elkanah loved Anna above [Peninnah]. And the Lord had shut up her womb, because the Lord had not given her a child according to her affliction, and according to the despondency of her affliction.

6 And for this cause was she despondent, that the Lord had shut up her womb, so as not to give her a child.

7 And thus she did year by year, when she went up unto the house of the Lord; and she was despondent, and she wept, and did not eat.

8 And Elkanah her husband spake unto her, "Anna!" And she answered, "Behold, I am [here]." And he said unto her, "Wherefore weepest thou? And why dost thou not eat? And wherefore doth thy heart thus smite thee? Am I not (I am) [more] good unto thee than ten sons?"

9 So Anna rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk, and she stood before the Lord. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by the doorposts of the temple of the Lord.

10 And she, being bitter in soul, prayed unto the Lord, and weeping, she wept sorely.

11 And she vowed a vow unto the Lord, saying:
