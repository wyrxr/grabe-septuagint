516 ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Α΄. ΚΕΦ. ΙΖ΄.
42 ἀνὴρ δ᾽ αἴρων τὸν θυρεὸν ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐπέβλεψεν ὁ ἀλ-
    λόφυλος. Καὶ ἴδε Γολιὰθ τὸν Δαυίδ, καὶ ἡτίμασεν αὐτὸν ὅτι αὔ-
    τὸς ἦν παιδάριον, καὶ αὐτὸς πυῤῥάκης μετὰ κάλλους ὀφθαλμῶν.
43 Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ ἀλλόφυλος πρὸς Δαυίδ, Ὡσεὶ κύων ἐγώ εἰμι, ὅτι
    σὺ ἔρχῃ πρὸς με ἐν ῥάβδῳ καὶ λίθῳ; Καὶ κατηράσατο ὁ ἀλλό-
44 φυλος τὸν Δαυίδ ἐν τοῖς εἰδώλοις αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ ἀλλόφυ-
    λος πρὸς Δαυίδ, Δεῦρο πρὸς με, καὶ παραδώσω τὰς σάρκας σου
45 τοῖς πετεινοῖς τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ τοῖς θηρίοις τῆς γῆς. Καὶ εἶ-
    πε Δαυίδ πρὸς τὸν ἀλλόφυλον, Σὺ ἔρχῃ πρὸς με ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ
    καὶ ἐν δόρατι καὶ ἐν ἀσπίδι, κἀγὼ πορεύσομαι πρὸς σὲ ἐν ὀνό-
    ματι Κυρίου Σαβαώθ, Θεοῦ παρατάξεως Ἰσραήλ, ἣν ὠνείδισας
46 σήμερον. Καὶ ἀποκλείσει σε Κύριος ἐν τῇ χειρί μου σήμερον, καὶ
    ἀποκτενῶ σε, καὶ ἀφελῶ τὴν κεφαλὴν σου ἀπὸ σοῦ, καὶ δώσω τὰ
    κῶλά σου καὶ τὰ κῶλα παρεμβολῆς ἀλλοφύλων ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ταύ-
    τῃ τοῖς πετεινοῖς τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ τοῖς θηρίοις τῆς γῆς, καὶ γνώσε-
47 ται πᾶσα ἡ γῆ, ὅτι ἐστὶ Θεὸς ἐν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ γνώσεται πᾶσα ἡ
    ἐκκλησία αὕτη, ὅτι οὐκ ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ καὶ δόρατι σώζει Κύριος,
    ὅτι τοῦ Κυρίου ὁ πόλεμος, καὶ παραδώσει Κύριος ὑμᾶς εἰς χεῖ-
48 ρας ἡμῶν. Καὶ ἀνέστη ὁ ἀλλόφυλος, καὶ ἐπορεύθη, καὶ ἤγγι-
    σεν εἰς συνάντησιν Δαυίδ. Καὶ ἐτάχυνε Δαυίδ, καὶ ἔδραμεν εἰς
49 τὴν παράταξιν τοῦ ἀλλοφύλου. Καὶ ἐξέτεινε Δαυίδ τὴν χεῖρα
    αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸ κάδιον, καὶ ἔλαβε λίθον ἕνα, καὶ ἐσφενδόννησε,
    καὶ ἐπάταξε τὸν ἀλλόφυλον ἐπὶ τὸ μέτωπον αὐτοῦ, καὶ διέδυ ὁ
    λίθος διὰ τῆς περικεφαλαίας ἐπὶ τὸ μέτωπον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔπεσεν
50 ἐπὶ τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν. Καὶ ἐκραταίωσε Δαυίδ ὑπὲρ
    τὸν ἀλλόφυλον ἐν τῇ σφενδόνῃ καὶ ἐν τῷ λίθῳ, καὶ ἐπάταξε τὸν
    ἀλλόφυλον, καὶ ἐθανάτωσεν αὐτόν, καὶ ῥομφαία οὐκ ἦν ἐν χειρὶ
51 Δαυίδ. Καὶ ἔδραμε Δαυίδ, καὶ ἐπέστη ἐπ᾽ αὐτόν, καὶ ἔλαβε τὴν
    ῥομφαίαν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐξέσπασεν αὐτὴν ἐκ τοῦ κολεοῦ αὐτῆς, καὶ
    ἐθανάτωσεν αὐτόν, καὶ ἀφεῖλεν ἐν αὐτῇ τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ
    εἶδαν οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι, ὅτι τέθνηκεν ὁ δυνατὸς αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔφυγαν.
52 Καὶ ἀνίστανται ἄνδρες Ἰσραὴλ καὶ Ἰούδα, καὶ ἠλάλαξαν, καὶ κα-
    τεδίωξαν ὀπίσω αὐτῶν ἕως εἰσόδου Γαί, καὶ ἕως τῆς πύλης Ἀ-
    σκάλωνος. Καὶ ἔπεσον τραυματίαι τῶν ἀλλοφύλων ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ
53 τῶν πυλῶν, καὶ εἰς Γέθ, καὶ ἕως Ἀκαρών. Καὶ ἀνέστρεψαν ἄν-
    δρες Ἰσραὴλ ἐκκλίνοντες ὀπίσω τῶν ἀλλοφύλων, καὶ κατεπάτουν

42 And a man bearing his shield before him. And the Philistine looked, and when Goliath beheld David, he disdained him, for he was but a youth, and ruddy, with beauty in his eyes.
43 Then the Philistine said unto David, "Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with a staff and with a stone?" And the Philistine cursed David by his idols.
44 And the Philistine said unto David, "Come to me, and I shall give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and unto the beasts of the earth."
45 Then said David unto the Philistine, "Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the Name of the LORD Sabaoth, the God of the array of Israel, whom thou hast this day defied."
46 "And the LORD shall deliver thee into my hand this day; and I shall smite thee, and take thy head from thee; and I shall give thy carcases, yea, and the carcases of the camp of the Philistines, this day unto the fowls of the heaven and to the beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel; and all this
47 assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear; for the battle is the LORD's, and the LORD shall deliver you into our hands."
48 And when the Philistine arose, and went forth, and drew nigh to meet David, then David hasted, and ran toward the array of the Philistine.
49 And David stretched forth his hand into his bag, and took thence a stone, and slung it, and smote the Philistine upon his forehead, so that the stone sank through his helmet upon his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.
50 So David prevailed over the Philistine with his sling and with the stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him. But there was no sword in the hand of David.
51 Then David ran, and stood upon him, and took his sword, and drew it out of its sheath, and slew him, and with it cut off his head. And when the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.
52 And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued after them even unto the entrance of Gai, and unto the gate of Ashkelon. And the wounded of the Philistines fell upon the road of the gates, and unto Gath, and unto Ekron.
53 And the men of Israel returned, turning aside from [the pursuit of] the Philistines, and they trampled upon
