**ΚΕΦ. ΛΒ´. ΛΓ´. Ι Ω Β.**

14 προσδέμενοι Κυρίῳ· ἀνθρώπῳ δὲ ἐπετρέψατε λαλῆσαι τοιαῦτα ῥήματα.
15 Ἐπεποίηθησαν, οὐκ ἀπεκρίθησαν ἔτι· ἐπαλαίωσαν ἐξ αὐτῶν λόγους.
16 Ὑπέμεινα, οὐ γὰρ ἐλάλησαν, ὅτι ἔστησαν, οὐκ ἀπεκρίθησαν ὅτι ἀποκριθῶ κἀγὼ μέρος.
17 Ὑπολαβὼν δὲ Ἐλιούς, λέγει· πάλιν λαλήσω, πλήρης γάρ εἰμι ῥημάτων· ἐλέκει δέ με τὸ πνεῦμα τῆς γαστρός μου·
18 καὶ ἡ γαστήρ μου ὥσπερ ἀσκὸς γλεύκους γέμων δεδεμένος, ἢ ὥσπερ φυσητὴρ χαλκέως (δεδεμένος καὶ) κατεῤῥηγώς.
19 κατεῤῥηγώς. Λαλήσω ἵνα ἀναπαύσωμαι, ἀνοίξας τὰ χείλη μου·
20 ἄνθρωπον γὰρ οὐ μὴ αἰσχυνθῶ, ἀλλὰ μὴν οὐδὲ βροτὸν οὐ μὴ ἐντραπῶ·
21 οὐ γὰρ ἐπίσταμαι θαυμάσαι πρόσωπον· εἰ δὲ μή, καὶ ἐμὲ ζήτες ἔδονται.

**ΚΕΦ. ΛΓ´. XXXIII.**

1 Οὐ μὴν δὲ ἀλλὰ ἄκουσον Ἰὼβ τὰ ῥήματά μου, καὶ τὴν λαλίαν μου ἐνωτίζου·
2 ἰδοὺ γὰρ ἤνοιξα τὸ στόμα μου, καὶ ἐλάλησεν ἡ γλῶσσά μου.
3 Καθαρά μου ἡ καρδία ἐν ῥήμασι, σύνεσις δὲ χειλέων μου καθαρὰ νοήσει.
4 Πνεῦμα θεῖον τὸ ποιῆσάν με, πνοὴ δὲ παντοκράτορος ἡ διδάσκουσά με.
5 Ἐὰν δυνηθῆς, δὸς μοι ἀπόκρισιν πρὸς ταῦτα·
6 ὑπόμεινον, (καὶ) στῆθι σὺ κατ᾿ ἐμέ, καὶ ἐγὼ κατὰ σέ.
7 Ἐκ πηλοῦ διήρτισαι σὺ ὡς καὶ ἐγώ· ἐκ τοῦ αὐτοῦ διηρτίσμεθα (πηλοῦ).
8 Οὐχὶ ὁ φόβος μου φοβήσει σε, οὐδὲ ἡ χείρ μου βαρεῖα ἔσται ἐπὶ σοί.
9 Πλὴν εἶπας ἐν ὠσί μου, (φωνὴν δὲ ῥημάτων σου ἀκήκοα.)
10 Διότι λέγεις· καθαρός εἰμι, οὐχ ἥμαρτον (τοῖς ἔργοις), ἀμέμπτος (δὲ) εἰμι, οὐ γὰρ ἠνόμησα·
11 μέμψιν δὲ κατ᾿ ἐμοῦ εὗρε, καὶ ἥγηταί με ὥσπερ ὑπεναντίον αὐτῷ·
12 ἔθετο δὲ τὸν πόδα μου ἐν ξύλῳ, καὶ ἐφύλαξέ μου πάσας τὰς ὁδούς.
13 Πῶς γὰρ λέγεις· δίκαιός εἰμι, καὶ οὐκ ἐπακήκοέ μου ;
14 αἰώνιος γὰρ ἐστιν (ὁ) ἐπάνω βροτῶν.
15 Λέγεις γάρ· διατί τῆς δίκης μου οὐκ ἐπακήκοεν ἐν παντὶ ῥήματι ;
16 Ἐν γὰρ τὸ ἅπαξ λαλήσει ὁ Κύριος· ἐν δὲ τῷ δευτέρῳ ἐνύπνιον, ἢ (ὡς φάσμα) ἐν μελέτῃ νυκτερινῇ, ὡς
17 ὅταν ἐπιπίπτῃ φόβος δεινὸς ἐπ᾿ ἀνθρώπους, ἐπὶ νυσταγμάτων ἐπὶ κοίτης·
18 τότε ἀνακαλύπτει νοῦν ἀνθρώπων, ἐν εἴδεσι φόβου τοιούτοις ἐξεφόβησεν αὐτούς,
19 ἀποστρέψαι ἄνθρωπον ἐξ ἀδικίας αὐτοῦ·
20 τὸ δὲ σῶμα αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ (ἀδικίας) πτώματος ἐῤῥύσατο, καὶ ἐφείσατο τῆς ψυχῆς αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ θανάτου, τοῦ μὴ πεσεῖν αὐτὸν.

## CHAPTER XXXII. (continued)

**14** [Ye wait upon the Lord; yet] ye have permitted a man to speak such words.
**15** They were made; [yet] they answered not still; they grew old in [their] arguments.
**16** I waited, for they spoke not, because they stood still, and they answered not; that I also might answer my part.
**17** Then Elihu answered and said:
    "I will speak again, for I am full of words;
    and the spirit within my belly doth rend me.
**18** And my belly is as a wineskin, filled with new wine, being bound,
    or as a smith's bellows (being bound and) burst.
**19** Burst! I will speak, that I may find rest, having opened my lips;
**20** for I will not be ashamed of any man, and indeed I will not be put to shame by any mortal;
**21** for I know not how to show deference to a person: but if not, even me shall cares devour."

## CHAPTER XXXIII.

**1** Nevertheless, of a truth, hearken, O Job, unto my words, and give ear unto my speech;
**2** for behold, I have opened my mouth, and my tongue hath spoken.
**3** My heart is pure in words, and the understanding of my lips is pure in wisdom.
**4** The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty doth instruct me.
**5** If thou canst, give me an answer to these things;
**6** wait, (and) stand thou over against me, and I over against thee.
**7** Out of clay wast thou fashioned, even as I; out of the same [clay] were we fashioned.
**8** Surely my fear shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.
**9** Nevertheless thou hast said in mine ears, (yea, I have heard the voice of thy words.)
**10** Because thou sayest: 'I am pure, I have not sinned (in works), and I am blameless (indeed), for I have not committed iniquity;
**11** but He hath found occasion for blame against me, and He hath esteemed me as one adverse unto Him;
**12** and He hath put my foot in the stocks, and hath watched all my paths.'
**13** How then sayest thou, 'I am righteous, and He hath not heard me?'
**14** For He that is above mortals is eternal.
**15** For thou sayest, 'Wherefore hath He not heard my cause in every word?'
**16** For once the Lord shall speak; and in the second [instance, it is] a dream,
    or (as a vision) in a nightly meditation, as
**17** when a dreadful fear falleth upon men, during slumberings upon the bed;
**18** then doth He uncover the mind of men, and in such fearsome apparitions hath He terrified them,
**19** [so as] to turn a man from his unrighteousness;
**20** and He hath delivered his body from (unrighteousness of) falling, and hath spared his soul from death,
    [so that] he might not fall.
