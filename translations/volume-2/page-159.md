ΚΕΦ. ΙΓʹ.
34 Καὶ ἐγένετο τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο εἰς ἁμαρτίαν τῷ οἴκῳ Ἱεροβοάμ, καὶ εἰς ὄλεθρον, καὶ εἰς ἀφανισμὸν ἀπὸ προσώπου τῆς γῆς.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΔʹ.
1 Ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ ἠῤῥώστησεν Ἀβιὰ υἱὸς Ἱεροβοάμ.
2 Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ Ἱεροβοὰμ πρὸς τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ· Ἀνάστηθι, καὶ ἀλλοιώθῃτι, καὶ οὐ γνώσονται ὅτι σὺ γυνὴ Ἱεροβοάμ, καὶ πορευθήσῃ εἰς Σηλώ. Καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐκεῖ Ἀχιὰ ὁ προφήτης· αὐτὸς ἐλάλησεν ἐμὲ τοῦ βασιλεῦσαι ἐπὶ τὸν λαὸν τοῦτον.
3 Καὶ λάβε εἰς τὴν χεῖρά σου τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ τοῦ Θεοῦ ἄρτους, καὶ κολλυρίδα τοῖς τέκνοις αὐτοῦ, καὶ σταφίδας, καὶ στάμνον μέλιτος, καὶ ἐλεύσῃ πρὸς αὐτὸν αὐτὸς ἀναγγελεῖ σοι τί ἔσται τῷ παιδί.
4 Καὶ ἐποίησεν οὕτως γυνὴ Ἱεροβοάμ. Καὶ ἀνέστη, καὶ ἐπορεύθη εἰς Σηλώ, καὶ εἰσῆλθεν ἐν οἴκῳ Ἀχιά· καὶ ὁ ἄνθρωπος πρεσβύτερος τοῦ ἰδεῖν, καὶ ἠμβλυώπουν οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ γήρους αὐτοῦ.
5 Καὶ Κύριος εἶπε πρὸς Ἀχιά· Ἰδοὺ γυνὴ τοῦ Ἱεροβοὰμ εἰσέρχεται τοῦ ἐκζητῆσαι ῥῆμα παρὰ σοῦ περὶ υἱοῦ αὐτῆς, ὅτι ἀῤῥωστός ἐστιν· κατὰ τοῦτο καὶ κατὰ τοῦτο λαλήσεις πρὸς αὐτήν· καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ εἰσέρχεσθαι αὐτήν, καὶ αὕτη ἀπεξενοῦτο.
6 Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἤκουσεν Ἀχιὰ τὴν φωνὴν ποδῶν αὐτῆς, εἰσερχομένης αὐτῆς ἐν τῷ ἀνοίγματι, καὶ εἶπεν, εἰσελθε, γυνὴ Ἱεροβοάμ, ἵνατί σὺ τοῦτο ἀποξενοῦσαι; καὶ ἐγὼ εἰμι ἀπόστολος πρὸς σὲ σκληρός.
7 Πορευθεῖσα εἰπὸν τῷ Ἱεροβοάμ, τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ· Ἀνθ᾿ οὗ ὅσον ὕψωσά σε ἀπὸ μέσου λαοῦ, καὶ ἔδωκά σε ἡγούμενον ἐπὶ τὸν λαόν μου Ἰσραήλ,
8 καὶ ἐξέῤῥηξα σὺν τὸ βασίλειον ἀπὸ τοῦ οἴκου Δαυΐδ, καὶ ἔδωκα αὐτὸ σοί, καὶ οὐκ ἐγένου ὡς ὁ δοῦλός μου Δαυΐδ, ὃς ἐφύλαξε τὰς ἐντολάς μου, καὶ ὃς ἐπορεύθη ὀπίσω μου ἐν πάσῃ καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ, ποιῆσαι ἕκαστον τὸ εὐθὲς ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς μου,
9 καὶ ἐπονηρεύσω τοῦ ποιῆσαι παρὰ παντὸς ὅσοι ἐγένοντο εἰς πρόσωπόν σου, καὶ ἐπορεύθης, καὶ ἐποίησας σεαυτῷ θεοὺς ἑτέρους, χωνευτά, τοῦ παροργίσαι με, καὶ ἐμὲ ἐῤῥίψας ὀπίσω σώματός σου,
10 διὰ τοῦτο ἐγὼ ἄγω κακίαν πρὸς σὲ εἰς οἶκον Ἱεροβοάμ, ἐξολοθρεύσω τοῦ Ἱεροβοὰμ οὐροῦντα πρὸς τοῖχον, ἐχόμενον, καὶ ἐγκαταλελειμμένον ἐν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐπιλέξω οἴκου Ἱεροβοάμ, καθὼς ἐπιλέγεται ἡ κόπρος, ἕως τελειωθῆναι αὐτόν.
11 Οἱ τεθνηκότες τοῦ Ἱεροβοὰμ ἐν τῇ πόλει, καταφάγονται οἱ κύνες, καὶ τὸν τεθνηκότα ἐν τῷ ἀγρῷ καταφάγονται τὰ πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, ὅτι Κύριος ἐλάλησε.

**1 Kings 13:34**
And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, and for a destruction, and for an utter annihilation from the face of the earth.

### CHAPTER XIV

**1** In that time Abijah, the son of Jeroboam, fell sick.

**2** And Jeroboam said unto his wife, "Arise now, and disguise thyself, that they may not know that thou art the wife of Jeroboam; and get thee to Shiloh. For behold, there is Ahijah the prophet: it was he that spake concerning me, that I should be king over this people.

**3** And take in thine hand for the man of God, [some] loaves, and a cake for his children, and raisins, and a pot of honey; and thou shalt go unto him: he himself shall declare unto thee what shall become of the child."

**4** And Jeroboam's wife did so; and she arose, and went to Shiloh, and came into the house of Ahijah. Now the man was too aged to see, for his eyes were dim by reason of his old age.

**5** And the LORD had said unto Ahijah, "Behold, the wife of Jeroboam cometh to inquire a word of thee concerning her son, for he is sick. Thus and thus shalt thou speak unto her." And it came to pass, when she came in, that she feigned herself to be a stranger.

**6** And it came to pass, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she came in at the entrance, that he said, "Come in, O wife of Jeroboam! Why dost thou thus disguise thyself? For I am a harsh messenger unto thee."

**7** "Go, tell Jeroboam, 'Thus saith the LORD God of Israel: Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the midst of the people, and made thee a leader over My people Israel,

**8** and I tore away the kingdom itself from the house of David, and gave it unto thee; yet thou wast not as My servant David, who kept My commandments, and who walked after Me with all his heart, to do that which was right in My eyes in every [matter];

**9** but thou hast done evil above all that were before thee, and art gone and hast made thee other gods, molten images, to provoke Me to anger, and hast cast Me behind thy back;

**10** therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will utterly cut off from Jeroboam every male, him that urinates against a wall, both him that is confined and him that is left at large in Israel; and I will sweep clean the house of Jeroboam, even as dung is swept away, until it be utterly consumed.

**11** Those of Jeroboam who die in the city, the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field, the fowls of the heaven shall eat. For the LORD hath spoken it."
