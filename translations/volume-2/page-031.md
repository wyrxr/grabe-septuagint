ἀλλοφύλων ἐν Μαχμάς· καὶ ἐκοπίασεν ὁ λαὸς σφόδρα· καὶ ἐκλίθη 32
ὁ λαὸς εἰς τὰ σκῦλα· καὶ ἔλαβεν ὁ λαὸς ποίμνια, καὶ βουκόλια,
καὶ τέκνα βοῶν, καὶ ἔσφαξεν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, καὶ ἤσθιεν ὁ λαὸς
σὺν τῷ αἵματι. Καὶ ἀπηγγέλῃ τῷ Σαούλ, λέγοντες· ὅτι ὁ λαὸς 33
ἡμάρτηκε τῷ Κυρίῳ, φαγὼν σὺν τῷ αἵματι· καὶ εἶπε Σαούλ· ἐν
Γεθθὲμ κυλίσατε μοι ἐνταῦθα λίθον μέγαν. Καὶ εἶπε Σαούλ· δια- 34
σπάρητε ἐν τῷ λαῷ, καὶ εἴπατε αὐτοῖς προσαγαγεῖν ἐνταῦθα
ἕκαστος τὸν μόσχον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἕκαστος τὸ πρόβατον αὐτοῦ· καὶ
σφαζάτω ἐπὶ τούτου, καὶ φάγετε αὐτά, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἁμάρτητε τῷ
Κυρίῳ τοῦ ἐσθίειν σὺν τῷ αἵματι· καὶ προσήγαγε πᾶς ὁ λαὸς
ἕκαστος τὸ ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ τὴν νύκτα, καὶ ἔσφαζον ἐκεῖ. Καὶ ᾠ- 35
κοδόμησεν ἐκεῖ Σαοὺλ θυσιαστήριον τῷ Κυρίῳ· τοῦτο ἤρξατο Σα-
οὺλ οἰκοδομῆσαι θυσιαστήριον τῷ Κυρίῳ. Καὶ εἶπε Σαούλ· κατα- 36
βῶμεν ὀπίσω τῶν ἀλλοφύλων τὴν νύκτα, καὶ διαρπάσωμεν ἐν αὐτοῖς
ἕως διαφαύσῃ ἡ ἡμέρα, καὶ μὴ ὑπολείπωμεν ἐν αὐτοῖς ἄνδρα· καὶ
εἶπαν· πᾶν τὸ ἀγαθὸν ἐνώπιόν σου ποίει· καὶ εἶπεν ὁ ἱερεύς·
προσέλθωμεν ἐνταῦθα πρὸς τὸν Θεόν. Καὶ ἐπηρώτησε Σαοὺλ τὸν 37
Θεόν· εἰ καταβῶ ὀπίσω τῶν ἀλλοφύλων· εἰ παραδώσεις αὐτοὺς
εἰς χεῖρας Ἰσραήλ; καὶ οὐκ ἀπεκρίθη αὐτῷ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ.
Καὶ εἶπε Σαούλ· προσαγάγετε ἐνταῦθα πάσας τὰς γωνίας τοῦ Ἰσ- 38
ραήλ, καὶ γνῶτε καὶ ἴδετε ἐν τίνι γέγονεν ἡ ἁμαρτία αὕτη σήμε-
ρον. Ὅτι ζῇ Κύριος ὁ σώσας τὸν Ἰσραὴλ ὅτι ἐὰν ἀποκριθῇ κατὰ 39
Ἰωνάθαν τοῦ υἱοῦ μου, θανάτῳ ἀποθανεῖται. Καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ ἀπο-
κρινόμενος ἐκ παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ. Καὶ εἶπε παντὶ ἀνδρὶ Ἰσραήλ· 40
ὑμεῖς ἔσεσθε εἰς δουλείαν, καὶ ἐγὼ καὶ Ἰωνάθαν ὁ υἱός μου ἐσόμεθα
εἰς δουλείαν. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ λαὸς πρὸς Σαούλ· τὸ ἀγαθὸν
ἐνώπιόν σου ποίει. Καὶ εἶπε Σαούλ· Κύριε ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ, τί 41
ὅτι οὐκ ἀπεκρίθης τῷ δούλῳ σου σήμερον; ἢ ἐν ἐμοὶ ἢ ἐν Ἰωνά-
θαν τῷ υἱῷ μου ἡ ἀδικία; Κύριε ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραὴλ δὸς δήλους· καὶ
ἐὰν τάδε εἴπῃς τῷ λαῷ σου Ἰσραήλ, δὸς δὴ ὁσιότητα. Καὶ κλη-
ροῦται Ἰωνάθαν καὶ Σαούλ, καὶ ὁ λαὸς ἐξῆλθε. Καὶ εἶπε Σαούλ· 42
βάλλετε ἀναμέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ ἀναμέσον Ἰωνάθαν τοῦ υἱοῦ μου· ὃν
ἂν κατακληρώσηται Κύριος, ἀποθανέτω. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ λαὸς πρὸς
Σαούλ· οὐκ ἔστι τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο· καὶ κατεκράτησε Σαοὺλ τοῦ λαοῦ,
καὶ βάλλουσιν ἀναμέσον αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀναμέσον Ἰωνάθαν τοῦ υἱοῦ
αὐτοῦ, καὶ κατακληροῦται Ἰωνάθαν. Καὶ εἶπε Σαούλ πρὸς Ἰωνάθαν· 43

31 ...among the Philistines in Michmash. And the people toiled exceedingly; and the people fell upon the spoil.
32 And the people took flocks, and herds, and calves, and slaughtered them upon the ground, and the people did eat with the blood.
33 And it was reported unto Saul, saying, "Behold, the people have sinned against the LORD, eating with the blood." And Saul said, "Roll unto me here a great stone in Gethchem."
34 And Saul said, "Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, 'Bring hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slaughter them upon this [stone], and eat them; and sin not against the LORD by eating with the blood.'" And all the people brought every man that which was in his hand that night, and slaughtered them there.
35 And Saul built there an altar unto the LORD: this was the altar which Saul began to build unto the LORD.
36 And Saul said, "Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and despoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man among them." And they said, "Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee." Then said the priest, "Let us draw near hither unto God."
37 And Saul inquired of God, saying, "Shall I go down after the Philistines? Wilt Thou deliver them into the hand of Israel?" But He answered him not that day.
38 And Saul said, "Draw near hither, all ye chief ones of Israel; know and see wherein this sin hath been today."
39 "For as the LORD liveth, who saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die." And there was none among all the people that answered him.
40 Then said he unto all the men of Israel, "Ye shall be in bondage, and I and Jonathan my son shall be in bondage." And the people said unto Saul, "Do what seemeth good unto thee."
41 And Saul said, "O LORD God of Israel, why hast Thou not answered Thy servant this day? Is the iniquity in me, or in Jonathan my son? O LORD God of Israel, give [us] clear manifestations; and if Thou declare these things to be upon Thy people Israel, then give [us] holiness." And Jonathan and Saul were taken by lot, and the people departed.
42 And Saul said, "Cast [the lot] between me and Jonathan my son: whomsoever the LORD doth take, he shall die." And the people said unto Saul, "This thing ought not to be." But Saul prevailed against the people; and they cast lots between him and Jonathan his son; and Jonathan was taken by lot.
43 Then Saul said unto Jonathan, "Tell me what thou hast done."
