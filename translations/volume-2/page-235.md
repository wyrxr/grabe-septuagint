ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Δʹ. 711
ΚΕΦ. ΚΔ. XXIV.
1 Ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις αὐτοῦ ἀνέβη Ναβουχοδονόσορ βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος, καὶ ἐγενήθη αὐτῷ Ἰωακεὶμ δοῦλος τρία ἔτη, καὶ ἐπέστρεψε, καὶ ἠθέτησεν ἐν αὐτῷ.
2 Καὶ ἀπέστειλε Κύριος αὐτῷ τοὺς μονοζώνους τῶν Χαλδαίων, καὶ τοὺς μονοζώνους Συρίας, καὶ τοὺς μονοζώνους Μωάβ, καὶ τοὺς μονοζώνους υἱῶν Ἀμμών, καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν αὐτοὺς ἐν γῇ Ἰούδα, τοῦ κατισχῦσαι κατὰ τὸν λόγον Κυρίου, ὃν ἐλάλησεν ἐν χειρὶ τῶν δούλων αὐτοῦ, τῶν προφητῶν.
3 Πλὴν ἐπὶ τὸν θυμὸν Κυρίου ἦν ἐν τῷ Ἰούδα, ἀποστῆσαι αὐτὸν ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ ἐν ἁμαρτίαις Μανασσῆ κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησε.
4 Καί γε αἷμα ἀθῶον ἐξέχεε, καὶ ἐπλήσε τὴν Ἰερουσαλὴμ αἵματος ἀθώου, καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησε Κύριος ἰλασθῆναι.
5 Καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Ἰωακείμ, καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν, οὐκ ἰδοὺ ταῦτα γεγραμμένα ἐπὶ βιβλίῳ λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν Ἰούδα;
6 Καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Ἰωακεὶμ μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Ἰωαχεὶν υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀντ᾽ αὐτοῦ.
7 Καὶ οὐ προσέθετο ἔτι βασιλεὺς Αἰγύπτου ἐξελθεῖν ἐκ γῆς αὐτοῦ, ὅτι ἔλαβε βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος ἀπὸ τοῦ χειμάρρου Αἰγύπτου ἕως τοῦ ποταμοῦ Εὐφράτου πάντα ὅσα ἦν τοῦ βασιλέως Αἰγύπτου.
8 Υἱὸς ὀκτωκαίδεκα ἐτῶν Ἰωαχεὶν ἐν τῷ βασιλεύειν αὐτόν, καὶ τρίμηνον ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ὄνομα τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ Νάσθα, θυγάτηρ Ἑλλαναθάν, ἐξ Ἱερουσαλήμ.
9 Καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ πονηρὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς Κυρίου, κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ.
10 Ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ ἀνέβη Ναβουχοδονόσορ βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἦλθεν ἡ πόλις ἐν περιοχῇ·
11 καὶ εἰσῆλθε Ναβουχοδονόσορ ὁ βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος εἰς τὴν πόλιν, καὶ οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ ἐπολιόρκουν (τὴν) ἐπ᾽ αὐτήν.
12 Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Ἰωαχεὶν βασιλεὺς Ἰούδα ἐπὶ βασιλέα Βαβυλῶνος, αὐτὸς καὶ οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἡ μήτηρ αὐτοῦ, καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες αὐτοῦ, καὶ εὐνοῦχοι αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔλαβεν αὐτὸν βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος ἐν ἔτει ὀγδόῳ τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ.
13 Καὶ ἐξήνεγκεν ἐκεῖθεν πάντας τοὺς θησαυροὺς οἴκου Κυρίου, καὶ τοὺς θησαυροὺς οἴκου τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ συνέκοψε πάντα τὰ σκεύη τὰ χρυσᾶ, ἃ ἐποίησε Σαλωμὼν βασιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τῷ ναῷ Κυρίου κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα Κυρίου.

### Literary Translation:

### 2 Kings 24

**1** In his days, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant for three years; then he turned and rebelled against him.
**2** And the Lord sent against him the bands of men girded [for battle] from the Chaldeans, and the bands of men girded [for battle] from Syria, and the bands of men girded [for battle] from Moab, and the bands of men girded [for battle] from the sons of Ammon; and He sent them forth into the land of Judah, to bring to pass the word of the Lord, which He had spoken by the hand of His servants, the prophets.
**3** Nevertheless, it was by the wrath of the Lord that [this befell] Judah, to remove them from His presence because of the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he had done.
**4** And moreover, he shed innocent blood, and filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; and the Lord would not be propitiated.
**5** Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they not indeed written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
**6** And Jehoiakim slept with his fathers; and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.
**7** And the king of Egypt ventured no more to go forth from his land; for the king of Babylon had taken from the Brook of Egypt unto the River Euphrates all that had belonged to the king of Egypt.
**8** Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Nastha, the daughter of Hellanathan of Jerusalem.
**9** And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his father had done.
**10** At that time, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, came up to Jerusalem, and the city came under siege.
**11** And Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, entered into the city; and his servants did press the siege upon her (the city).
**12** And Jehoiachin, the king of Judah, went out unto the king of Babylon, himself, and his servants, and his mother, and his princes, and his eunuchs; and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign.
**13** And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king's house; and he cut in pieces all the golden vessels which Solomon, the king of Israel, had made in the temple of the Lord, according to the word of the Lord.
