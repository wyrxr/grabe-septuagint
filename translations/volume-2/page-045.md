**1** ΚΑΙ ἀπέδρα Δαυὶδ ἐκ Ναυιὼδ ἐν Ῥαμᾶ, καὶ ἔρχεται, καὶ εἶπεν † ἐνώπιον Ἰωνάθαν· τί πεποίηκα; καὶ τί τὸ ἀδίκημά μου; καὶ τί ἡμάρτηκα ἐνώπιον τοῦ πατρός σου, ὅτι ἐπιζητεῖ τὴν ψυχήν μου;
**2** Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Ἰωνάθαν· μηδαμῶς σοι, οὐ μὴ ἀποθάνῃς· ἰδοὺ οὐ μὴ ποιήσῃ ὁ πατήρ μου ῥῆμα μέγα, ἢ ῥῆμα μικρόν, καὶ οὐκ ἀποκαλύψει τὸ ὠτίον μου. Καὶ τί ὅτι κρύψει ὁ πατήρ μου ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο; οὐκ ἔστι τοῦτο.
**3** Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Δαυὶδ τῷ Ἰωνάθαν, καὶ εἶπε, γινώσκων οἶδεν ὁ πατήρ σου, ὅτι εὕρηκα χάριν ἐνώπιόν σου, καὶ εἶπε· μὴ γνώτω τοῦτο Ἰωνάθαν, μὴ οὐ βούληται, ἀλλὰ ζῇ Κύριος, καὶ ζῇ ἡ ψυχή σου, ὅτι καθὼς εἶπον, πεπλήρωται ἀνάμεσον ἐμοῦ καὶ ἀνάμεσον τοῦ πατρός σου ἕως θανάτου.
**4** Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰωνάθαν πρὸς Δαυίδ· τί ἐπιθυμεῖ ἡ ψυχή σου, καὶ ποιήσω σοι;
**5** Καὶ εἶπε Δαυὶδ πρὸς Ἰωνάθαν· ἰδοὺ δὴ νεομηνία αὔριον, καὶ ἐγὼ καθίσας οὐ καθήσομαι μετὰ τοῦ βασιλέως φαγεῖν, καὶ ἐξαποστελεῖς με, καὶ κρυβήσομαι ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ ἕως δείλης τῆς τρίτης.
**6** Ἐὰν ἐπισκεπτόμενος ἐπισκέψηταί με ὁ πατήρ σου, καὶ ἐρεῖς· παραιτούμενος παρῃτήσατο ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ Δαυὶδ δραμεῖν εἰς Βηθλεὲμ τὴν πόλιν αὐτοῦ, ὅτι θυσία τῶν ἡμερῶν ἐκεῖ ὅλη τῇ φυλῇ.
**7** Ἐὰν τάδε εἴπῃ, ἀγαθῶς· εἰρήνη τῷ δούλῳ σου· καὶ ἐὰν δὲ σκληρῶς ἀποκριθῇ σοι, γνῶθι ὅτι συντετέλεσται ἡ κακία παρ᾿ αὐτοῦ.
**8** Καὶ ποιήσεις ἔλεος μετὰ τοῦ δούλου σου, ὅτι εἰς διαθήκην Κυρίου εἰσήγαγες τὸν δοῦλόν σου μετὰ σεαυτοῦ· καὶ εἰ ἔστιν ἀδικία ἐν τῷ δούλῳ σου, θανατώσον με σύ, καὶ ἕως τοῦ πατρός σου ἵνατί οὕτως εἰσάγεις με;

**Chapter 19**

**22** saying, "Where are Samuel and David?" And they answered, "Behold, they are in Naioth in Ramah."
**23** And he went forth from thence to Naioth in Ramah; and the Spirit of God came upon him also, and he went on his way, prophesying, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.
**24** And he also stripped off his clothes, and he prophesied, even he, before them; and he lay naked all that day and all that night. Therefore they said, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"

**Chapter 20**

**1** And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came, and said before Jonathan, "What have I done? And what is mine iniquity? And what have I sinned before thy father, that he seeketh my life?"
**2** And Jonathan said unto him, "Far be it from thee! Thou shalt not die. Behold, my father will not do any great thing or small thing, but he will disclose it unto mine ear. And why should my father hide this matter from me? This is not so."
**3** And David answered Jonathan, and said, "Thy father knoweth full well that I have found favor in thine eyes; and he hath said, 'Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be unwilling.' But as the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, even as I have spoken, so hath it been fulfilled between me and between thy father, unto death."
**4** Then said Jonathan unto David, "Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will do it for thee."
**5** And David said unto Jonathan, "Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and I, having taken my seat, shall not sit to eat with the king; and thou shalt send me away, and I will hide myself in the field until the third evening."
**6** "If thy father should inquire concerning me, then shalt thou say, 'David earnestly entreated me to run to Bethlehem, his city, for there is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family.'"
**7** "If he say thus, 'It is well,' then shall there be peace unto thy servant. But if he answer thee harshly, then know thou that the evil [to be wrought by him] is fully determined."
**8** "And thou shalt show mercy unto thy servant, for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the Lord with thyself. And if there be iniquity in thy servant, slay thou me thyself; for why shouldest thou thus bring me unto thy father?"
**9** And Jonathan said, "Far be it from thee! For if I should know for certain that evil is determined by my father to come upon thee, then..."
