**25** χειρῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ παρέθετο ἐν οἴκῳ, καὶ ἐξαπέστειλε τοὺς ἄνδρας,
καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν. Καὶ αὐτὸς εἰσῆλθε, καὶ παρειστήκει πρὸς τὸν κύριον αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτὸν ᾿Ελισσαῖε· πόθεν, Γιεζί; καὶ εἶπε
**26** Γιεζί, οὐ πεπόρευται ὁ δοῦλός σου ἔνθα καὶ ἔνθα. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς
αὐτὸν ᾿Ελισσαῖε· οὐχὶ ἡ καρδία μου ἐπορεύθη; ὅτε ἐπέστρεψεν ὁ
ἀνὴρ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἅρματος εἰς συνάντησίν σου; καὶ νῦν ἔλαβες τὸ ἀργύριον, καὶ νῦν ἔλαβες (καὶ) τὰ ἱμάτια, καὶ ἐλαιῶνας, καὶ ἀμπε-
**27** λῶνας, καὶ πρόβατα καὶ βόας, καὶ παῖδας, καὶ παιδίσκας. Καὶ ἡ
λέπρα Ναιμὰν κολληθήσεται ἐν σοί, καὶ ἐν τῷ σπέρματί σου εἰς
τὸν αἰῶνα. καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ἐκ τοῦ προσώπου αὐτοῦ λελεπρωμένος ὡσεὶ χιών.

ΚΕΦ. ς´. VI.

**1** ΚΑΙ εἶπον οἱ υἱοὶ τῶν προφητῶν πρὸς ᾿Ελισσαῖε· ᾿Ιδοὺ δὴ ὁ
**2** τόπος, ἐν ᾧ ἡμεῖς οἰκοῦμεν ἐνώπιόν σου, στενὸς ἀφ᾽ ἡμῶν. Πορευθῶμεν δὴ ἕως τοῦ ᾿Ιορδάνου, καὶ λάβωμεν ἐκεῖθεν ἀνὴρ δοκὸν
μίαν, καὶ ποιήσωμεν ἑαυτοῖς ἐκεῖ τοῦ οἰκεῖν ἐκεῖ. καὶ εἶπε· Δεῦτε.
**3** Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ εἷς ἐπιεικῶς· δεῦρο μετὰ τῶν δούλων σου· ῾Ο δὲ εἶ-
**4** πεν· ἐγὼ πορεύσομαι. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη μετ᾽ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἦλθον εἰς
**5** τὸν ᾿Ιορδάνην, καὶ ἔτεμνον τὰ ξύλα. Καὶ ἰδοὺ ὁ εἷς καταβαλὼν
τὴν δοκόν, καὶ τὸ σιδήριον ἐξέπεσεν εἰς τὸ ὕδωρ· καὶ ἐβόησε, καὶ
**6** εἶπεν· ὢ κύριε, καὶ αὐτὸ κεχρυμμένον. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ ἄνθρωπος τοῦ
Θεοῦ· ποῦ ἔπεσε; Καὶ ἔδειξεν αὐτῷ τὸν τόπον· καὶ ἀπέκνιζε ξύ-
**7** λον, καὶ ἔῤῥιψεν ἐκεῖ· καὶ ἐπεπλάσασε τὸ σιδήριον. Καὶ εἶπεν· ῾Υψώ-
**8** σον σεαυτῷ· καὶ ἐξέτεινε τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔλαβεν αὐτό. Καὶ
βασιλεὺς Συρίας ἦν πολεμῶν ἐν ᾿Ισραήλ. Καὶ ἐβουλεύσατο πρὸς
τοὺς παῖδας αὐτοῦ, λέγων· εἰς τὸν τόπον τόνδε τινὰ ἐλμονὶ παρεμβαλῶ.
**9** Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ᾿Ελισσαῖε πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα ᾿Ισραήλ, λέγων· φύλαξαι· μὴ παρελθεῖν ἐν τῷ τόπῳ τούτῳ, ὅτι Συρία ἔχει
**10** κέκρυπται. Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ὁ βασιλεὺς ᾿Ισραὴλ εἰς τὸν τόπον ὅν
εἶπεν αὐτῷ ᾿Ελισσαῖε, καὶ διεστέλλατο αὐτῷ, καὶ ἐφυλάξατο ἐκεῖθεν οὐ μίαν οὐδὲ δύο. Καὶ ἐξεκινήθη ἡ ψυχὴ βασιλέως Συρίας
**11** περὶ τοῦ λόγου τούτου· καὶ ἐκάλεσε τοὺς παῖδας αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπε
πρὸς αὐτούς· οὐκ ἀναγγελεῖτέ μοι τίς προδίδωσί με βασιλεῖ ᾿Ισραήλ;
**12** Καὶ εἶπεν εἷς τῶν παίδων αὐτοῦ· οὐχί, κύριέ μου βασιλεῦ· ὅτι
᾿Ελισσαῖε, ὁ προφήτης ὁ ἐν ᾿Ισραὴλ ἀναγγέλλει τῷ βασιλεῖ ᾿Ισραὴλ

**CHAPTER FIVE.**

**25** [the things] from their hands, and laid [them] in the house, and sent forth the men; and they departed. And he himself went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him, "Whence, Gehazi?" And Gehazi said, "Thy servant hath not gone hither nor thither."
**26** And Elisha said unto him, "Hath not my heart gone [with you]? When the man turned from his chariot to meet thee? And now hast thou taken the silver, and now hast thou taken, [yea, even,] the garments, and olive groves, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and manservants, and maidservants?
**27** Thus the leprosy of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed forevermore." And he went out from his presence, a leper as white as snow.

**CHAPTER SIX.**

**1** And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, "Behold now, the place wherein we dwell before thee is too narrow for us.
**2** Let us go, we pray thee, even unto the Jordan, and let every man take thence a beam, and let us make for ourselves there a place to dwell in." And he said, "Go ye."
**3** And one [of them] said humbly, "Come thou with thy servants." But he said, "I will go."
**4** And he went with them, and they came unto the Jordan, and cut down wood.
**5** And behold, as one was felling the beam, the iron [head] fell into the water. And he cried out, and said, "Alas, master, and it [is] gilded!"
**6** And the man of God said, "Where fell it?" And he showed him the place. And he cut off a piece of wood, and cast it in there; and the iron [head] formed itself [upon it].
**7** And he said, "Lift up unto thyself." And he stretched out his hand, and took it.
**8** Now the king of Syria was making war against Israel. And he consulted with his servants, saying, "Into this place, a certain Elmoni, will I encamp."
**9** And Elisha sent unto the king of Israel, saying, "Take heed; pass not through this place, for Syria hath, it is hidden."
**10** And the king of Israel sent unto the place whereof Elisha had spoken unto him, and he warned him, and kept guard from thence, not once, nor twice.
**11** And the soul of the king of Syria was moved concerning this word. And he called his servants, and said unto them, "Will ye not declare unto me who betrayeth me unto the king of Israel?"
**12** And one of his servants said, "Nay, my lord, O king; for Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, declareth unto the king of Israel
