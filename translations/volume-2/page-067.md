Σαοὺλ, καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ, καὶ τύπτουσιν ἀλλόφυλοι τὸν Ἰωνά-
θαν, καὶ τὸν Ἀμιναδάβ, καὶ τὸν Μελχισουὲ, υἱοὺς Σαούλ. Καὶ 3
βαρύνεται ὁ πόλεμος ἐπὶ Σαοὺλ, καὶ εὑρίσκουσιν αὐτὸν οἱ
ἀκοντισταὶ ἄνδρες τοξόται, καὶ ἐτραυματίσθη εἰς τὰ ὑπο-
χόνδρια. Καὶ εἶπε Σαοὺλ πρὸς τὸν αἴροντα τὰ σκεύη αὑ- 4
τοῦ· σπάσαι τὴν ῥομφαίαν σου καὶ ἀποκέντησόν με ἐν αὐτῇ, μὴ
ἔλθωσιν οἱ ἀπερίτμητοι οὗτοι, καὶ ἀποκεντήσωσί με, καὶ ἐμπαίξωσι
μοι. Καὶ οὐκ ἐβούλετο ὁ αἴρων τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ, ὅτι ἐφοβήθη
σφόδρα. Καὶ ἔλαβε Σαοὺλ τὴν ῥομφαίαν, καὶ ἐπέπεσεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτήν.
Καὶ ἴδεν ὁ αἴρων τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ, ὅτι τέθνηκε Σαοὺλ, καὶ 5
ἐπέπεσε καὶ αὐτὸς ἐπὶ τὴν ῥομφαίαν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀπέθανε μετ᾿ αὑ-
τοῦ. Καὶ ἀπέθανε Σαοὺλ καὶ οἱ τρεῖς υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὁ αἴρων 6
τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντες οἱ ἄνδρες αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ
κατὰ τὸ αὐτό. Καὶ ἴδον οἱ ἄνδρες Ἰσραὴλ οἱ ἐν τῷ πέραν τοῦ 7
κοιλάδος, καὶ οἱ ἐν τῷ πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου, ὅτι ἔφυγον οἱ ἄνδρες
Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ ὅτι τέθνηκε Σαοὺλ, καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ καταλεί-
πουσι τὰς πόλεις αὐτῶν, καὶ φεύγουσι. Καὶ ἔρχονται οἱ ἀλλό-
φυλοι καὶ κατοικοῦσιν ἐν αὐταῖς. Καὶ ἐγενήθη τῇ ἐπαύριον, καὶ 8
ἔρχονται οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι ἐκδιδύσκειν τοὺς νεκροὺς, καὶ εὑρίσκουσι
τὸν Σαοὺλ καὶ τοὺς τρεῖς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ πεπτωκότας ἐπὶ τὰ ὄρη
Γελβουέ. Καὶ ἀποστρέφουσιν αὐτὸν, καὶ ἐξέδυσαν τὰ σκεύη 9
αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀποστέλλουσιν αὐτὰ εἰς γῆν ἀλλοφύλων κύκλῳ, εὐαγγε-
λίζοντες τοῖς εἰδώλοις αὐτῶν καὶ τῷ λαῷ αὐτῶν· καὶ ἀνέθηκαν
τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸ Ἀσταρτεῖον, καὶ τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ κατέπη-
ξαν ἐν τῷ τείχει Βηθσάν. Καὶ ἀκούουσι περὶ αὐτοῦ οἱ κατοι- 11
κοῦντες Ἰαβεὶς τῆς Γαλααδίτιδος ἃ ἐποίησαν οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι τῷ
Σαούλ. Καὶ ἀνέστησαν πᾶς ἀνὴρ δυνάμεως, καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν 12
ὅλην τὴν νύκτα, καὶ ἔλαβον τὸ σῶμα Σαοὺλ, καὶ τὸ σῶμα Ἰω-
νάθαν τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τείχους Βηθσὰν, καὶ φέρουσιν αὐτοὺς
εἰς Ἰαβεὶς, καὶ κατακαίουσιν αὐτοὺς ἐκεῖ· καὶ λαμβάνουσι τὰ ὀ- 12
στᾶ αὐτῶν, καὶ θάπτουσιν ὑπὸ τὴν ἄρουραν τὴν ἐν Ἰαβεὶς, καὶ
νηστεύουσιν ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας.

### CHAPTER XXXI.

**2** ...Saul, and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Aminadab, and Melchisue, the sons of Saul.
**3** And the battle waxed grievous against Saul, and the spearmen and the archers found him; and he was gravely wounded in his lower parts.
**4** Then said Saul unto his armor-bearer, "Draw forth thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come, and thrust me through, and make sport of me." But his armor-bearer would not; for he was exceeding sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.
**5** And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell upon his sword, and died with him.
**6** So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armor-bearer, and all his men, that selfsame day, together.
**7** And when the men of Israel that were beyond the valley, and they that were beyond the Jordan, saw that the men of Israel were fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook their cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
**8** And it came to pass on the morrow, that the Philistines came to strip the slain, and they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.
**9** And they turned him, and stripped off his armor, and sent them into the land of the Philistines round about, to proclaim tidings unto their idols and unto their people.
**10** And they put his armor in the temple of Astarte, and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan.
**11** And when the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead heard of that which the Philistines had done unto Saul,
**12** Then all the valiant men arose, and went all the night, and took the body of Saul and the body of Jonathan his son from the wall of Beth-shan, and brought them to Jabesh, and burned them there.
**13** And they took their bones, and buried them under the field in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
