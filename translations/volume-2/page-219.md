ΚΕΦ. ΙΖ'. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Δ'. 695
μὴ ποιῆσαι κατὰ ταῦτα· ἐγκατέλιπον τὰς ἐντολὰς Κυρίου Θεοῦ 16
αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐποίησαν ἑαυτοῖς χώνευμα, δύο δαμάλεις, καὶ ἐποίη-
σαν ἄλση, καὶ προσεκύνησαν πάσῃ τῇ δυνάμει τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ
ἐλάτρευσαν τῷ Βάαλ· καὶ διῆγον τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτῶν καὶ τὰς θυγα- 17
τέρας αὐτῶν ἐν πυρί, καὶ ἐμαντεύοντο μαντείας, καὶ οἰωνίζοντο·
καὶ ἐπράθησαν τοῦ ποιῆσαι τὸ πονηρὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς Κυρίου, πα-
ροργίσαι αὐτόν. Καὶ ἐθυμώθη Κύριος σφόδρα ἐν τῷ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ 18
ἀπέστησεν αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ τοῦ προσώπου αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐχ ὑπελείφθη
πλὴν φυλὴ Ἰούδα μονωτάτη. Καί γε Ἰούδας οὐχ ἐφύλαξε τὰς ἐν- 19
τολὰς τοῦ Κυρίου Θεοῦ αὐτῶν. καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν ἐν τοῖς δικαιώμα-
σιν Ἰσραὴλ οἷς ἐποίησαν, καὶ ἀπεώσαντο τὸν Κύριον ἐν παντὶ σπέρ- 20
ματι Ἰσραήλ. καὶ ἐσάλευσεν αὐτοὺς, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτοὺς ἐν χειρὶ
διαρπαζόντων αὐτοὺς, ἕως οὗ ἀπέρριψεν αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ προσώπου
αὐτοῦ. Ὅτι πλὴν Ἰσραὴλ ἐπάνωθεν οἴκου Δαυίδ, καὶ ἐβασίλευ- 21
σαν τὸν Ἱεροβοὰμ υἱὸν Ναβάτ, καὶ ἐξέωσεν Ἱεροβοὰμ τὸν Ἰσραὴλ
ἐξόπισθεν Κυρίου, καὶ ἐξήμαρτεν αὐτοὺς ἁμαρτίαν μεγάλην. Καὶ 22
ἐπορεύθησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐν πάσῃ ἁμαρτία Ἱεροβοάμ. ἣ ἐποίη-
σεν· οὐκ ἀπέστησαν ἀπ’ αὐτῆς, ἕως οὗ μετέστησε Κύριος τὸν 23
Ἰσραὴλ ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ, καθὼς ἐλάλησε Κύριος ἐν χειρὶ
πάντων τῶν δούλων αὐτοῦ, τῶν προφητῶν. Καὶ ἀπῳκίσθη Ἰσραὴλ
ἐπάνωθεν τῆς γῆς αὐτοῦ εἰς Ἀσσυρίους ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης.
Καὶ ἤγαγε βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων ἐκ Βαβυλῶνος τὸν ἐκ Χουθά, καὶ 24
ἀπὸ Ἀϊά, καὶ ἀπὸ Αἰμάθ, καὶ Σεφφαρουαΐμ, καὶ κατῴκισαν ἐν
πόλεσιν Σαμαρείας ἀντὶ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐκληρονόμησαν τὴν
Σαμάρειαν, καὶ κατῴκισαν ἐν ταῖς πόλεσιν αὐτῆς. Καὶ ἐγένετο 25
ἐν ἀρχῇ τῆς καθέδρας αὐτῶν ἐκεῖ, οὐκ ἐφοβήθησαν τὸν Κύριον,
καὶ ἀπέστειλε Κύριος ἐν αὐτοῖς τοὺς λέοντας, καὶ ἦσαν ἀποκτέ-
νοντες ἐν αὐτοῖς. Καὶ εἶπον τῷ βασιλεῖ Ἀσσυρίων, λέγοντες· τὰ 26
ἔθνη ἃ ἀπῴκισας, καὶ ἀντεκάθισας ἐν πόλεσιν Σαμαρείας, οὐκ ἔ-
γνωσαν τὸ κρῖμα τοῦ Θεοῦ τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἀπέστειλε Κύριος εἰς
αὐτοὺς τοὺς λέοντας, καὶ ἰδοὺ εἰσι θανατοῦντες αὐτοὺς, καθότι
οὐκ οἴδασι τὸ κρῖμα τοῦ Θεοῦ τῆς γῆς. Καὶ ἐνετείλατο ὁ βασι- 27
λεὺς Ἀσσυρίων, λέγων· ἀπάρατε ἐκεῖθεν, καὶ πορευέσθωσαν, καὶ
κατοικήτωσαν ἐκεῖ, καὶ φωτιοῦσιν αὐτοὺς τὸ κρῖμα τοῦ Θεοῦ τῆς
γῆς. Καὶ ἤγαγον ἕνα τῶν ἱερέων ὧν ἤγαγον ἀπὸ Σαμαρείας, καὶ 28
ἐκάθισεν ἐν Βαιθήλ, καὶ ἦν φωτίζων αὐτοὺς ὅπως φοβηθῶσι τὸν

### 2 Kings 17

**16** to do according to these things; but they forsook the commandments of the LORD their God, and fashioned for themselves a molten image, two calves, and made Asherahs, and bowed down unto all the host of heaven, and served Baal.
**17** And they passed their sons and their daughters through fire, and practiced divinations, and observed omens; and they sold themselves to do that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke Him to anger.
**18** Therefore the LORD was exceeding wroth with Israel, and removed them from His presence: and there was none left but the tribe of Judah only.
**19** Moreover, Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they had made.
**20** And they rejected the LORD in all the seed of Israel; and He shook them, and delivered them into the hand of those who plundered them, until He cast them away from His presence.
**21** Forasmuch as Israel, separating itself from the house of David, made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king; and Jeroboam drove Israel away from following the LORD, and caused them to commit a great sin.
**22** And the children of Israel walked in all the sin of Jeroboam, which he had done; they departed not from it,
**23** until the LORD removed Israel from His presence, even as the LORD had spoken by the hand of all His servants, the prophets. So Israel was carried away from their land unto the Assyrians, until this day.

**24** And the king of Assyria brought [people] from Babylon, [and those] from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and Sepharvaim, and settled them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they inherited Samaria, and dwelt in its cities.
**25** And it came to pass, at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they feared not the LORD; wherefore the LORD sent among them lions, and they were slaying among them.
**26** And they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, "The nations whom thou hast carried away, and settled in the cities of Samaria, know not the ordinance of the God of the land; therefore the LORD hath sent among them lions, and behold, they are slaying them, because they know not the ordinance of the God of the land."
**27** And the king of Assyria commanded, saying, "Ye shall bring from thence [a priest], and let them go, and dwell there, and they shall teach them the ordinance of the God of the land."
**28** And they brought one of the priests whom they had brought from Samaria, and he dwelt in Bethel, and was teaching them how they should fear the
