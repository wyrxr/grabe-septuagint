ἀδελφοὺς Ὀχοζίου λειτουργοῦντας τῷ Ὀχοζίᾳ, καὶ ἀπέκτεινεν αὐ-
9 τούς. Καὶ εἶπε τοῦ ζητῆσαι τὸν Ὀχοζίαν, καὶ κατέλαβεν αὐτὸν
  ἰατρευόμενον ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ, καὶ ἤγαγον αὐτὸν πρὸς Ἰηοῦ, καὶ ἀπ-
  έκτεινεν αὐτόν, καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτόν, ὅτι εἶπαν, υἱὸς Ἰωσαφὰτ ἐστιν,
  ὃς ἐζήτησε τὸν Κύριον ἐν ὅλῃ καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ· καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἐν οἴκῳ
10 Ὀχοζία κατισχύσαι δύναμιν περὶ τῆς βασιλείας. Καὶ Γοθολία ἡ
  μήτηρ Ὀχοζίου εἶδεν ὅτι τέθνηκεν αὐτῆς ὁ υἱός, καὶ ἠγέρθη, καὶ
11 ἀπώλεσε πᾶν τὸ σπέρμα τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ ἐν οἴκῳ Ἰούδα. Καὶ
  ἔλαβεν Ἰωσαβεὲθ ἡ θυγάτηρ τοῦ βασιλέως τὸν Ἰωὰς υἱὸν Ὀχο-
  ζίου, καὶ ἔκλεψεν αὐτὸν ἐκ μέσου τῶν υἱῶν τοῦ βασιλέως τῶν
  θανατουμένων, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὸν καὶ τὴν τροφὸν αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸ τα-
  μιεῖον τῶν κλινῶν, καὶ ἔκρυψεν αὐτὸν Ἰωσαβεὲθ θυγάτηρ τοῦ βα-
  σιλέως Ἰωράμ, ἀδελφὴ Ὀχοζίου, γυνὴ Ἰωιάδᾳ τοῦ ἱερέως, καὶ
  ἔκρυψεν αὐτὸν ἀπὸ προσώπου Γοθολίας, καὶ οὐκ ἀπέκτεινεν αὐ-
12 τόν. Καὶ ἦν μετ᾿ αὐτῆς ἐν οἴκῳ τοῦ Θεοῦ κατακεκρυμμένος ἓξ
  ἔτη, καὶ Γοθολία ἐβασίλευσεν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΓ΄. XXIII.

1 ΚΑὶ ἐν τῷ ἔτει τῷ ἑβδόμῳ ἐκραταίωσεν Ἰωδαὲ, καὶ ἔλαβε
  τοὺς ἑκατοντάρχας, τὸν Ἀζαρίαν υἱὸν Ἰωράμ, καὶ τὸν Ἰσμαὴλ
  υἱὸν Ἰωνανᾶν, καὶ τὸν Ἀζαρίαν υἱὸν Ἰωβήδ, καὶ τὸν Μαασαίαν
  υἱὸν Ἀδαία, καὶ τὸν Ἐλισαφὰτ υἱὸν Ζαχαρίου μεθ᾿ αὐτοῦ εἰς οἶκον
2 Κυρίου. Καὶ ἐκύκλωσαν τὸν Ἰούδαν, καὶ συνήγαγον τοὺς Λευί-
  τας ἐκ πασῶν τῶν πόλεων Ἰούδα, καὶ ἄρχοντας τῶν πατριῶν τοῦ
3 Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἦλθον εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ διέθεντο πᾶσα ἡ ἐκκλη-
  σία Ἰούδα διαθήκην ἐν οἴκῳ τοῦ Θεοῦ μετὰ τοῦ βασιλέως· καὶ
  ἔδειξεν αὐτοῖς τὸν υἱὸν τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· Ἰδοὺ ὁ υἱὸς
  τοῦ βασιλέως βασιλευέτω, καθὼς ἐλάλησε Κύριος, ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον
4 Δαυίδ. Νῦν ὁ λόγος οὗτος, ὃν ποιήσετε· τὸ τρίτον ἐξ ἡμῶν εἰσ-
  πορευέσθωσαν τὸ σάββατον τῶν ἱερέων, καὶ τῶν Λευιτῶν, καὶ εἰς
5 τὰς πύλας τῶν εἰσόδων. Καὶ τὸ τρίτον ἐν οἴκῳ τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ
  τὸ τρίτον ἐν τῇ πύλῃ τῇ μέσῃ, καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ἐν αὐλαῖς οἴκου Κυ-
6 ρίου. Καὶ μὴ εἰσελθέτω εἰς οἶκον Κυρίου, ἐὰν μὴ οἱ ἱερεῖς, καὶ
  οἱ Λευῖται, καὶ οἱ λειτουργοῦντες τῶν Λευιτῶν· αὐτοὶ εἰσελεύσον-
  ται ὅτι ἅγιοι εἰσι, καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς φυλασσέσθω φυλακὰς Κυρίου.

⁸ ...the brethren of Ahaziah who ministered to Ahaziah; and he slew them.

⁹ And he gave command to seek Ahaziah; and they found him while he was healing in Samaria, and brought him to Jehu; and they slew him, and buried him: for they said, He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the Lord with all his heart. And there was not in the house of Ahaziah [any] power to prevail concerning the kingdom.

¹⁰ And Gotholia, the mother of Ahaziah, when she saw that her son was dead, arose and destroyed all the royal seed of his kingdom in the house of Judah.

¹¹ But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash, the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons who were [being] put to death, and she put him and his nurse in the bedchamber. And Jehoshabeath, the daughter of King Jehoram, the sister of Ahaziah, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, hid him; and he was hidden from the presence of Gotholia, so that she slew him not.

¹² And he was with her in the house of God, hidden for six years; and Gotholia reigned over the land.

### CHAPTER XXIII

¹ And in the seventh year, Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds: Azariah, the son of Jehoram; and Ishmael, the son of Johanan; and Azariah, the son of Joobed; and Maaseiah, the son of Adaiah; and Elishaphat, the son of Zechariah; [and brought them] with him into the house of the Lord.

² And they went about Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the chiefs of the fathers of Israel, and came to Jerusalem.

³ And all the congregation of Judah made a covenant in the house of God with the king. And he showed them the king's son, and said unto them, Behold, the king's son: let him reign, as the Lord hath spoken concerning the house of David.

⁴ Now this is the thing that ye shall do: a third part of you that enter in on the Sabbath, [even] of the priests and of the Levites, shall be at the gates of the entries.

⁵ And a third part shall be in the king's house; and a third part at the middle gate; and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the Lord.

⁶ And let none come into the house of the Lord, save the priests, and the Levites, and those Levites that minister; for they shall come in, because they are holy: and all the people shall keep the watches of the Lord.
