Καρμηλίου. Καὶ ἐθλίβη Δαυὶδ σφόδρα, ὅτι εἶπεν ὁ λαὸς λιθοβολῆσαι 6
αὐτόν, ὅτι κατώδυνος ψυχὴ παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ, ἑκάστου ἐπὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς
αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς θυγατέρας αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐκραταιώθη Δαυὶδ ἐν Κυρίῳ
Θεῷ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπε Δαυὶδ πρὸς Ἀβιάθαρ τὸν 7
ἱερέα υἱὸν Ἀχιμέλεχ· προσάγαγε τὸ Ἐφούδ. Καὶ προσήγαγεν Ἀβιάθαρ
τὸ Ἐφούδ πρὸς Δαυίδ. Καὶ ἐπηρώτησε Δαυὶδ διὰ τοῦ 8
Κυρίου, λέγων· εἰ καταδιώξω ὀπίσω τοῦ Γεδδοὺρ τούτου; εἰ καταλήψομαι
αὐτούς; καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· καταδίωκε, ὅτι καταλαμβάνων καταλήψῃ, καὶ
ἐξαιρούμενος ἐξελῇ. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη Δαυὶδ αὐτὸς 9
καὶ οἱ ἑξακόσιοι ἄνδρες μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔρχονται ἕως τοῦ χειμάρῥου
Βοσόρ, καὶ οἱ περισσοὶ ἔστησαν, καὶ ἐξεδίωκε σὺν τετρακοσίοις
ἀνδράσιν· ὑπέστησαν δὲ διακόσιοι ἄνδρες οἵτινες ἐκάθισαν πέραν τοῦ 10
χειμάρρου τοῦ Βοσόρ. Καὶ εὑρίσκουσιν ἄνδρα Αἰγύπτιον ἐν ἀγρῷ, 11
καὶ λαμβάνουσιν αὐτόν, καὶ ἄγουσιν αὐτὸν πρὸς Δαυίδ (ἐν ἀγρῷ)
καὶ διδόασιν αὐτῷ ἄρτον, καὶ ἔφαγε, καὶ ἐπότισαν αὐτὸν ὕδωρ.
Καὶ διδόασιν αὐτῷ κλάσμα παλάθης καὶ δύο σταφίδας, καὶ ἔφαγε, 12
καὶ κατέστη τὸ πνεῦμα αὐτοῦ ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ, ὅτι οὐ βεβρώκει ἄρτον,
καὶ οὐ πεπώκει ὕδωρ τρεῖς ἡμέρας καὶ τρεῖς νύκτας. Καὶ εἶπεν 13
αὐτῷ Δαυίδ· τίνος σὺ εἶ, καὶ πόθεν εἶ; καὶ εἶπε τὸ παιδάριον
τὸ Αἰγύπτιον· ἐγώ εἰμι δοῦλος ἀνδρὸς Ἀμαληκίτου, καὶ κατέλιπέ
με ὁ κύριός μου, ὅτι ἡνωχλήθην ἐγὼ σήμερον τριταῖος. Καὶ ἡμεῖς 14
ἐπεβέμεθα ἐπὶ νότον τοῦ Χεριηεί, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ τῆς Ἰουδαίας μέρη,
καὶ ἐπὶ νότον Χαλέβ, καὶ τὴν Σικελὰγ ἐνεπυρίσαμεν ἐν πυρί.
Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτὸν Δαυίδ· εἰ κατάξεις με ἐπὶ τὸ Γεδδοὺρ τοῦτο; 15
καὶ εἶπεν· ὄμοσσον δὴ μοι κατὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ μὴ θανατώσειν με, καὶ
μὴ παραδοῦναί με εἰς χεῖρας τοῦ κυρίου μου, καὶ κατάξω σε ἐπὶ
τὸ Γεδδοὺρ τοῦτο· Καὶ κατήγαγεν αὐτὸν ἐκεῖ, καὶ ἰδοὺ οὗτοι δια- 16
κεχυμένοι ἐπὶ πρόσωπον πάσης τῆς γῆς, ἐσθίοντες καὶ πίνοντες
καὶ ἑορτάζοντες ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς σκύλοις τοῖς μεγάλοις, οἷς ἔλαβον
ἐκ γῆς ἀλλοφύλων καὶ ἐκ γῆς Ἰούδα. Καὶ ἦλθεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτούς, καὶ 17
ἐπάταξεν αὐτοὺς Δαυὶδ ἀπὸ ἑωσφόρου ἕως δείλης καὶ τῇ ἐπαύριον,
καὶ οὐ περιεσώθη ἐξ αὐτῶν ἀνήρ, ὅτι ἀλλ᾿ ἢ τετρακόσια παιδάρια
ἃ ἦν ἐπιβεβηκότα ἐπὶ τὰς καμήλους, καὶ ἔφυγον. Καὶ ἀφείλατο 18
Δαυὶδ πάντα ἃ ἔλαβον οἱ Ἀμαληκῖται, καὶ ἀμφοτέρας τὰς γυναῖκας
αὐτοῦ ἐξείλατο Δαυίδ. Καὶ οὐ διεφώνησεν αὐτοῖς ἀπὸ 19
μικροῦ ἕως μεγάλου, καὶ ἕως υἱῶν καὶ θυγατέρων, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν

...the Carmelite.
**6** And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was bitter, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David strengthened himself in the LORD his God.
**7** Then said David to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, "Bring hither to me the ephod." And Abiathar brought the ephod to David.
**8** And David inquired of the LORD, saying, "Shall I pursue after this raiding band? Shall I overtake them?" And He answered him, "Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake them, and shalt surely rescue [all]."
**9** So David went, he himself and the six hundred men that were with him, and they came unto the Brook Besor. And the remainder stood still, and he pursued with four hundred men;
**10** But two hundred men stayed behind, who sat across the Brook Besor.
**11** And they found an Egyptian man in the field, and they took him, and brought him to David (in the field), and they gave him bread, and he did eat, and they gave him water to drink.
**12** And they gave him a piece of fig-cake, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him; for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water for three days and three nights.
**13** Then said David unto him, "Whose art thou? and whence art thou?" And the Egyptian youth answered, "I am a slave of an Amalekite man; and my master hath left me, because I fell sick three days ago.
**14** For we made an incursion upon the south of the Chereihei, and upon the land of Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and Ziklag we burned with fire."
**15** And David said unto him, "Wilt thou bring me down to this raiding band?" And he said, "Swear now unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this raiding band."
**16** And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad upon the face of all the land, eating and drinking and feasting with all the great spoils which they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.
**17** And David smote them from the morning twilight even unto the evening of the morrow, and there escaped no man of them, save four hundred young men who rode upon camels, and fled.
**18** And David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken; and David rescued both his wives.
**19** And there was nothing lacking unto them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, nor from the...
