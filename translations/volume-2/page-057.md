ΚΕΦ. ΚΕʹ. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Αʹ. 533
ἀδικία μου· λαλησάτω δὴ ἡ δούλη σου εἰς τὰ ὦτά σου, καὶ ἀκούσον τῶν λόγων τῆς δούλης σου. Μὴ δὴ θέσθω ὁ κύριός μου 25
καρδίαν αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὸν ἄνθρωπον τὸν λοιμὸν τοῦτον, ἐπὶ Νάβαλ,
ὅτι κατὰ τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ οὕτως ἐστί. Νάβαλ ὄνομα αὐτῷ, καὶ
ἀφροσύνη μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐγὼ ἡ δούλη σου οὐκ ἴδον τὰ παιδάρια τοῦ κυρίου μου ἃ ἀπέστειλας. Καὶ νῦν κύριέ μου, ζῇ Κύριος 26
καὶ ζῇ ἡ ψυχή σου, καθὼς ἐκώλυσέ σε Κύριος τοῦ μὴ ἐλθεῖν εἰς
αἷμα ἀθῶον, καὶ σώζειν τὴν χεῖρά σου σοι. Καὶ νῦν γένοιτο ὡς
Νάβαλ οἱ ἐχθροί σου καὶ οἱ ζητοῦντες τῷ κυρίῳ μου κακά. Καὶ 27
νῦν λάβε τὴν εὐλογίαν ταύτην, ἣν ἐνήνοχεν ἡ δούλη σου τῷ κυρίῳ μου (λάβε) καὶ δώσεις τοῖς παιδαρίοις τοῖς παρεστηκόσι τῷ κυρίῳ μου. Ἄρον δὴ τὸ ἀνόμημα τῆς δούλης σου, ὅτι ποιῶν ποιήσει 28
Κύριος τῷ κυρίῳ μου οἶκον πιστόν, ὅτι πόλεμον Κυρίου (μου)
ὁ κύριός μου πολεμεῖ, καὶ κακία οὐχ εὑρεθήσεται ἐν σοὶ πώποτε. Καὶ ἀναστήσεται ἄνθρωπος καταδιώκων σε, καὶ ζητῶν τὴν 29
ψυχήν σου, καὶ ἔσται ἡ ψυχὴ κυρίου μου ἐνδεδεμένη ἐν δεσμῷ
τῆς ζωῆς παρὰ Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ, καὶ ψυχὴν τῶν ἐχθρῶν σου σφενδονήσεις ἐν μέσῳ τῆς σφενδόνης. Καὶ ἔσται ὅτι ποιήσει Κύριος 30
τῷ κυρίῳ μου πάντα ὅσα ἐλάλησεν ἀγαθὰ ἐπὶ σέ, καὶ ἐντελεῖταί
σοι Κύριος εἰς ἡγούμενον ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ οὐκ ἔσται σοι τοῦτο 31
βδελυγμὸς καὶ σκάνδαλον καρδίας τῷ κυρίῳ μου, ἐκχέαι αἷμα ἀθῶον δωρεάν, καὶ σῶσαι χεῖρα κυρίου μου αὐτῷ· καὶ ἀγαθώσαι
Κύριος τῷ κυρίῳ μου, καὶ μνησθήσῃ τῆς δούλης σου ἀγαθῶσαι αὐτῇ. Καὶ εἶπε Δαυὶδ τῇ Ἀβιγαίᾳ· Εὐλογητὸς Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ, 32
ὃς ἀπέστειλέ σε σήμερον ἐν ταύτῃ εἰς ἀπάντησιν ἐμοί. Καὶ 33
εὐλογητὸς ὁ τρόπος σου, καὶ εὐλογημένη σὺ ἡ ἀποκωλύσασά με
σήμερον ἐν ταύτῃ μὴ ἐλθεῖν εἰς αἵματα, καὶ σῶσαι χεῖρά μου ἐμοί. Πλὴν ὅτι ζῇ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ, ὃς ἀπεκώλυσέ με σήμερον 34
τοῦ κακοποιῆσαί σε, ὅτι εἰ μὴ ἔσπευσας καὶ παρεγένου εἰς
ἀπάντην μου, τότε εἶπα· Εἰ ὑπολειφθήσεται τῷ Νάβαλ ἕως φωτὸς τοῦ πρωὶ οὐρῶν πρὸς τοῖχον. Καὶ ἔλαβε Δαυὶδ ἐκ τῆς χειρὸς 35
αὐτῆς πάντα ἃ ἔφερεν αὐτῷ, καὶ αὐτὴ εἶπεν· Ἀνάβηθι εἰς
εἰρήνην εἰς οἶκόν σου· βλέπε, ἤκουσα τῆς φωνῆς σου· καὶ ἠρέτισα τὸ πρόσωπόν σου. Καὶ παρεγενήθη Ἀβιγαία πρὸς Νάβαλ. 36
Καὶ ἰδοὺ αὐτῷ πότος ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ, ὡς πότος τοῦ βασιλέως·
καὶ ἡ καρδία Νάβαλ ἀγαθὴ ἐπ᾿ αὐτόν· καὶ αὐτὸς μεθύων

**24** my transgression. Let thy handmaiden, I pray thee, speak into thine ears, and hearken unto the words of thy handmaiden.
**25** Let not my lord, I pray thee, give heed unto this pestilent man, even Nabal; for as his name is, so is he. Nabal is his name, and folly is with him; and I, thy handmaiden, saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.
**26** Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, even as the LORD hath restrained thee from coming to shed innocent blood, and from taking vengeance by thine own hand; so now let thine enemies, and all they that seek evil against my lord, be as Nabal.
**27** And now, receive this present, which thy handmaiden hath brought unto my lord (receive it); and thou shalt give it unto the young men that attend upon my lord.
**28** Forgive, I pray thee, the transgression of thy handmaiden; for the LORD will surely make my lord a faithful house; because my lord fighteth the battles of the LORD [my God], and evil shall not be found in thee at any time.
**29** And though a man should rise up to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul, yet the soul of my lord shall be bound up in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he cast forth as from the hollow of a sling.
**30** And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have performed for my lord all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee leader over Israel,
**31** that this shall not be a cause of remorse unto thee, nor a stumbling block to the heart of my lord, for having shed innocent blood without a cause, and for my lord having taken vengeance by his own hand. And when the LORD shall deal bountifully with my lord, then remember thy handmaiden, to deal bountifully with her.
**32** And David said unto Abigail, "Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who hath sent thee this very hour to meet me.
**33** And blessed be thy discernment, and blessed art thou, who hast restrained me this day, in this very matter, from coming to shed blood, and from taking vengeance by mine own hand.
**34** For assuredly, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, who hath restrained me this day from doing thee harm, that unless thou hadst made haste and come to meet me, surely then I had sworn: 'If there be left unto Nabal by the morning light one that urinates against the wall!'"
**35** And David received from her hand all that she had brought unto him. And she said, "Go up in peace to your house; behold, I have hearkened to your voice, and have accepted your person."
**36** And Abigail came to Nabal; and behold, there was a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he himself was drunken
