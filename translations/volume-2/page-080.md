**4** μετὰ σοῦ. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῇ νυκτὶ ἐκείνῃ, καὶ ἐγένετο ῥῆμα Κυρίου
**5** πρὸς Νάθαν, λέγων· Πορεύου, καὶ εἰπὲ πρὸς τὸν δοῦλόν μου Δαυίδ, Τάδε λέγει Κύριος· Οὐ σὺ οἰκοδομήσεις μοι οἶκον τοῦ
**6** κατοικῆσαί με. Ὅτι οὐ κατῴκησα ἐν οἴκῳ ἀφ᾿ ἧς ἡμέρας ἀνήγαγον τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ ἐξ Αἰγύπτου ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης, καὶ ἤμην ἐμπεριπατῶν ἐν καταλύματι καὶ ἐν σκηνῇ, ἐν πᾶσιν οἷς διῆλ-
**7** θον ἐν παντὶ Ἰσραήλ· εἰ λαλῶν ἐλάλησα πρὸς μίαν φυλὴν τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ ᾧ ἐνετειλάμην ποιμαίνειν τὸν λαόν μου Ἰσραήλ, λέγων· Τί οὐκ ᾠ-
**8** κοδομήκατέ μοι οἶκον κέδρινον; Καὶ νῦν τάδε ἐρεῖς τῷ δούλῳ μου Δαυίδ, Τάδε λέγει Κύριος παντοκράτωρ· Ἔλαβόν σε ἐκ τῆς μάνδρας ἀπὸ ὄπισθεν τῶν προβάτων τοῦ εἶναί σε εἰς ἡγούμενον ἐπὶ τὸν λαόν μου, ἐπὶ τὸν Ἰσραήλ.
**9** Καὶ ἤμην μετὰ σοῦ ἐν πᾶσιν οἷς ἐπορεύου, καὶ ἐξωλόθρευσα πάντας τοὺς ἐχθρούς σου ἀπὸ προσώπου σου, καὶ ἐποίησά σε ὀνομαστὸν κατὰ τὸ ὄνομα τῶν μεγάλων τῶν
**10** ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς. Καὶ θήσομαι τόπον τῷ λαῷ μου τῷ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ καταφυτεύσω αὐτόν, καὶ κατασκηνώσω καθ᾿ αὐτόν, καὶ οὐ μεριμνήσει οὐκέτι· καὶ οὐ προσθήσει (ἔτι) υἱὸς ἀδικίας τοῦ ταπεινῶσαι αὐτόν,
**11** καθὼς ἀπὸ ἀρχῆς, ἀπὸ τῶν ἡμερῶν ὧν ἔταξα κριτὰς ἐπὶ τὸν λαόν μου (τὸν) Ἰσραήλ· καὶ ἀναπαύσω σε ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν ἐχθρῶν σου· καὶ ἀπαγγελεῖ σοι Κύριος, ὅτι οἶκον οἰκοδομήσεις αὐ-
**12** τῷ. Καὶ ἔσται ἐὰν πληρωθῶσιν αἱ ἡμέραι σου, καὶ κοιμηθῇς μετὰ τῶν πατέρων σου, καὶ ἀναστήσω τὸ σπέρμα σου μετὰ σέ, ὃς ἔσται ἐκ τῆς κοιλίας σου, καὶ ἑτοιμάσω τὴν βασιλείαν αὐτοῦ·
**13** Αὐτὸς οἰκοδομήσει μοι οἶκον τῷ ὀνόματί μου, καὶ ἀνορθώσω τὸν θρόνον αὐτοῦ ἕως εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα.
**14** Ἐγὼ ἔσομαι αὐτῷ εἰς πατέρα, καὶ αὐτὸς ἔσται μοι εἰς υἱόν. Καὶ ἐὰν ἔλθῃ ἡ ἀδικία αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐλέγξω αὐτὸν ἐν ῥάβδῳ ἀνδρῶν, καὶ ἐν ἀφαῖς υἱῶν ἀνθρώπων.
**15** Τὸ δὲ ἔλεός μου οὐκ ἀποστήσω ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καθὼς ἀπέστησα ἀφ᾿ ὧν ἀπέστησα ἐκ προσώπου μου.
**16** Καὶ πιστωθήσεται ὁ οἶκος αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἡ βασιλεία αὐτοῦ ἕως αἰῶνος ἐνώπιόν μου· καὶ ὁ θρόνος αὐτοῦ ἔσται ἀνωρθωμένος εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα,
**17** κατὰ πάντας τοὺς λόγους τούτους καὶ κατὰ πᾶσαν τὴν ὅρασιν ταύτην. Οὕτως ἐλάλησε Νάθαν πρὸς Δαυίδ.
**18** Καὶ εἰσῆλθεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Δαυίδ, καὶ ἐκάθισεν ἐνώπιον Κυρίου, καὶ εἶπε· Τίς εἰμι ἐγώ, Κύριέ μου Κύριε, καὶ τίς
**19** ὁ οἶκός μου, ὅτι ἠγάπηκάς με ἕως τούτων; Καὶ κατεσμικρύνθη μικρὸν ἐνώπιόν σου, Κύριέ μου Κύριε, καὶ ἐλάλησας ὑπὲρ τοῦ οἴκου
**20** τοῦ δούλου σου εἰς μακράν· οὗτος δὲ ὁ νόμος τοῦ ἀνθρώπου, Κύριέ μου, Κύριε. Καὶ τί προσθήσει Δαυὶδ ἔτι τοῦ λαλῆσαι πρὸς σέ; καὶ νῦν σὺ οἶδας τὸν δοῦλόν σου, Κύριέ μου Κύριε, καὶ διὰ
**21** τὸν λόγον σου πεποίηκας, καὶ κατὰ τὴν καρδίαν σου ἐποίησας πᾶσαν τὴν μεγαλωσύνην σου ταύτην, γνωρίσαι τὸν δοῦλόν σου, ἕνεκεν τοῦ μεγαλυνθῆναί σε, Κύριε Κύριέ μου·
**22** ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν ὡς σύ, καὶ οὐκ ἔστι Θεὸς πλὴν σοῦ ἐν πᾶσιν οἷς ἠκούσαμεν ἐν τοῖς ὠσὶν ἡμῶν.
**23** Καὶ τίς ὡς ὁ λαός σου Ἰσραὴλ ἔθνος ἄλλο ἐν τῇ γῇ; ὡς ὡδήγησεν αὐτὸν ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ λυτρώσασθαι αὐτῷ λαόν, τοῦ θέσθαι σε ὄνομα, τοῦ ποιῆσαι μεγαλωσύνην καὶ ἐπιφάνειαν, τοῦ ἐκβαλεῖν σε ἐκ προσώπου τοῦ λαοῦ σου, οὓς ἐλυτρώσω σεαυτῷ ἐξ Αἰγύπτου, ἔθνη καὶ σκηνώματα.
**24** Καὶ ἡτοίμασας σεαυτῷ τὸν λαόν σου Ἰσραὴλ εἰς λαὸν ἕως αἰῶνος, καὶ σύ, Κύριε, ἐγένου αὐτοῖς εἰς Θεόν.
**25** Καὶ νῦν, Κύριέ μου, ῥῆμα ὃ ἐλάλησας περὶ τοῦ δούλου σου καὶ τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ, πίστωσον ἕως αἰῶνος, καὶ ποίησον καθὼς ἐλάλησας.
**26** Καὶ μεγαλυνθείη τὸ ὄνομά σου ἕως αἰῶνος, λέγων· Κύριος παντοκράτωρ Θεὸς ἐπὶ τὸν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ὁ οἶκος τοῦ δούλου σου Δαυὶδ ἔσται ἀνωρθωμένος ἐνώπιόν σου.
**27** Ὅτι σὺ Κύριε παντοκράτωρ ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, ἀπεκάλυψας τὸ ὠτίον τοῦ δούλου σου, λέγων, Οἶκον οἰκοδομήσω σοι. Διὰ τοῦτο εὗρεν ὁ δοῦλός σου τὴν καρδίαν ἑαυτοῦ τοῦ προσεύξασθαι πρὸς σὲ τὴν προσευχὴν ταύτην.
**28** Καὶ νῦν, Κύριέ μου Κύριε, σὺ εἶ ὁ Θεός, καὶ οἱ λόγοι σου ἔσονται ἀληθινοί, καὶ ἐλάλησας ὑπὲρ τοῦ δούλου σου τὰ ἀγαθὰ ταῦτα.
**29** Καὶ νῦν ἄρξαι καὶ εὐλόγησον τὸν οἶκον τοῦ δούλου σου, τοῦ εἶναι εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα ἐνώπιόν σου, ἔτι σὺ (εἶ) Κύριέ μου Κύριε ἐλάλησας, καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς εὐλογίας σου εὐλογηθήσεται ὁ οἶκος τοῦ δούλου σου εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα.

### Chapter 7

**4** ...with thee." And it came to pass on that night, that the word of the Lord came unto Nathan, saying:
**5** "Go thou, and speak unto My servant David, 'Thus saith the Lord: Thou shalt not build Me a house for Me to dwell in.
**6** For I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even unto this day; but I have walked about in a lodging and in a tent, in all [the places] through which I have passed among all Israel.
**7** Did I ever speak unto any tribe of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd My people Israel, saying, 'Why have ye not built Me a house of cedar?'
**8** And now thus shalt thou say unto My servant David, 'Thus saith the Lord Almighty: I took thee from the sheepfold, from behind the sheep, to be a ruler over My people, over Israel.
**9** And I have been with thee in all places whither thou hast gone, and I have utterly destroyed all thine enemies from before thy face; and I have made thee famous according to the name of the great ones upon the earth.
**10** And I shall appoint a place for My people Israel, and I shall plant them, and they shall dwell by themselves, and they shall be troubled no more; and a son of iniquity shall no longer [again] afflict them,
**11** as from the beginning, from the days wherein I set judges over My people, even Israel. And I shall give thee rest from all thine enemies, and the Lord shall declare unto thee that thou shalt build a house for Him.
**12** And it shall come to pass, when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, who shall proceed from thy loins, and I will establish his kingdom.
**13** He shall build Me a house for My Name, and I will establish his throne even unto the age [forever].
**14** I will be to him a father, and he shall be to Me a son. And if his iniquity shall come, then I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the strokes of the sons of men.
**15** But My mercy shall I not take away from him, as I took it away from those whom I turned away from My presence.
**16** And his house shall be established, and his kingdom even unto the age before Me; and his throne shall be set up unto the age,
**17** according to all these words, and according to all this vision.' Thus did Nathan speak unto David.
**18** And King David went in, and sat before the Lord, and said, "Who am I, O Lord my Lord, and what is my house, that Thou hast loved me thus far?
**19** And it was made little in Thy sight, O Lord my Lord, and Thou hast spoken concerning the house of Thy servant for a long time to come; and is this the manner of man, O Lord, my Lord?
**20** And what shall David add yet to speak unto Thee? For now Thou knowest Thy servant, O Lord my Lord,
**21** and for Thy word hast Thou wrought, and according to Thine own heart hast Thou done all this Thy greatness, to make known Thy servant, for the sake of Thy being magnified, O Lord, my Lord;
**22** because there is none like Thee, and there is no God save Thee, in all things which we have heard with our ears.
**23** And who is like Thy people Israel, another nation on the earth? For God led him to redeem for Himself a people, to make for Thee a Name, to do greatness and manifestation, to cast *thee* out from the face of Thy people, whom Thou didst redeem for Thyself out of Egypt, [even from amidst] nations and [their] habitations.
**24** And Thou hast prepared for Thyself Thy people Israel to be a people unto the age, and Thou, O Lord, hast been to them God.
**25** And now, O my Lord, the word which Thou hast spoken concerning Thy servant and his house, confirm it unto the age, and do as Thou hast spoken.
**26** And let Thy Name be magnified unto the age, saying, 'The Lord Almighty God is over Israel,' and the house of Thy servant David shall be established before Thee.
**27** For Thou, O Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, hast uncovered the ear of Thy servant, saying, 'I will build a house for thee.' Therefore hath Thy servant found his heart to pray this prayer unto Thee.
**28** And now, O Lord my Lord, Thou art God, and Thy words shall be true, and Thou hast spoken concerning Thy servant these good things.
**29** And now begin and bless the house of Thy servant, that it may be unto the age before Thee; for Thou, O Lord my Lord, hast spoken it, and from Thy blessing shall the house of Thy servant be blessed unto the age."
