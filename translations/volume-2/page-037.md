ΚΑΙ συνάγουσιν ἀλλόφυλοι τὰς παρεμβολὰς αὐτῶν εἰς πόλεμον, 1
καὶ συνάγονται εἰς Σοχὼμ τῆς Ἰουδαίας, καὶ παρεμβάλλουσιν
ἀναμέσον Σοχώ, καὶ ἀναμέσον Ἀζηκὰ ἐν Ἀφεσδομμείν.
Καὶ Σαοὺλ καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες Ἰσραὴλ συνάγονται, καὶ παρεμβάλλουσιν 2
ἐν τῇ κοιλάδι, αὐτοὶ παρατάσσονται εἰς πόλεμον ἐξεναντίας
ἀλλοφύλων. Καὶ ἀλλόφυλοι ἵστανται ἐπὶ τοῦ ὄρους ἐνταῦθα, καὶ 3
Ἰσραὴλ ἵσταται ἐπὶ τοῦ ὄρους ἐνταῦθα, καὶ ὁ αὐλὼν ἀναμέσον
αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ἀνὴρ δυνατὸς ἐκ τῆς παρατάξεως τῶν ἀλλοφύλων, 4
Γολιὰθ ὄνομα αὐτῷ ἐκ Γὲθ, ὕψος αὐτοῦ ἓξ πήχεων
καὶ σπιθαμῆς. Καὶ περικεφαλαία ἐπὶ τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ θώρακα 5
ἁλυσιδωτὸν αὐτὸς ἐνδεδυκὼς· καὶ ὁ σταθμὸς τοῦ θώρακος
αὐτοῦ πέντε χιλιάδες σίκλων χαλκοῦ καὶ σιδήρου. Καὶ κνημῖδες 6
χαλκαῖ ἐπάνω τῶν σκελῶν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀσπὶς χαλκὴ ἀναμέσον
τῶν ὤμων αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ὁ χοντὸς τοῦ δόρατος αὐτοῦ ὡσεὶ μέσακλον 7
ὑφαίνοντος, καὶ ἡ λόγχη αὐτοῦ ἑξακοσίων σίκλων σιδήρου·
καὶ ὁ αἴρων τὰ ὅπλα αὐτοῦ προεπορεύετο αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἔστη, καὶ 8
ἀνεβόησε πρὸς τὴν παράταξιν Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς, ἔτι ἐκπορεύεσθε
παρατάσσασθαι πολέμῳ ἐξεναντίας ἡμῶν; οὐκ ἐγὼ εἰμι ἀλλόφυλος,
καὶ ὑμεῖς Ἑβραῖοι τοῦ Σαούλ; ἐκλέξασθε αὐτοῖς ἄνδρα,
καὶ καταβήτω πρός με. Καὶ ἐὰν δυνηθῇ πρὸς με πολεμῆσαι, 9
καὶ ἐὰν πατάξῃ με, καὶ ἐσόμεθα ὑμῖν εἰς δούλους. Ἐὰν
ἐγὼ δυνηθῶ, καὶ πατάξω αὐτὸν, ἔσεσθε ἡμῖν εἰς δούλους, καὶ
δουλεύσετε ἡμῖν. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ ἀλλόφυλος, Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ὠνείδισα τὴν 10
παράταξιν Ἰσραὴλ σήμερον ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ταύτῃ· δότε μοι ἄνδρα,
καὶ μονομαχήσομεν ἀμφότεροι. Καὶ ἤκουσαν Σαοὺλ καὶ πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ 11
τὰ ῥήματα αὐτοῦ τοῦ ἀλλοφύλου ταῦτα, καὶ ἐξέστησαν, καὶ
ἐφοβήθησαν σφόδρα. Καὶ εἶπε Δαυὶδ υἱὸς ἀνθρώπου Ἐφραθαίου· 12
οὗτος ἐκ Βηθλεὲμ Ἰούδα, καὶ ὄνομα αὐτῷ Ἰεσσαὶ, καὶ αὐτῷ ὀκτὼ
υἱοί. Καὶ ὁ ἀνὴρ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις Σαοὺλ πρεσβύτερος ἐληλυθὼς
ἐν ἀνδράσι. Καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν οἱ τρεῖς υἱοὶ Ἰεσσαὶ οἱ μείζονες, 13
ἐπορεύθησαν ὀπίσω Σαοὺλ εἰς πόλεμον, καὶ ὄνομα τῶν υἱῶν
αὐτοῦ τῶν πορευθέντων εἰς τὸν πόλεμον, Ἐλιὰβ ὁ πρωτότοκος
αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὁ δεύτερος αὐτοῦ Ἀμιναδάβ, καὶ ὁ τρίτος αὐτοῦ Σαμμά.

1 And the Philistines gathered their hosts for war, and were assembled at Socoh, which belongeth to Judah, and they encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.
2 And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched their camp in the valley, and arrayed themselves for battle against the Philistines.
3 And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side; and the valley was between them.
4 And there came forth a mighty man from the battle array of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.
5 And a helmet of bronze was upon his head, and he was clad in a coat of mail; and the weight of his coat was five thousand shekels of bronze and of iron.
6 And greaves of bronze were upon his legs, and a bronze shield was between his shoulders.
7 And the staff of his spear was like a weaver’s beam; and his spearhead weighed six hundred shekels of iron; and his armour-bearer went before him.
8 And he stood and cried out unto the battle array of Israel, and said unto them, 'Why are ye come forth to array yourselves for battle against us? Am not I a Philistine, and ye Hebrews of Saul? Choose ye for yourselves a man, and let him come down to me.'
9 'And if he be able to fight with me, and if he smite me, then shall we be your servants. But if I be able [to prevail], and smite him, then shall ye be our servants, and ye shall serve us.'
10 And the Philistine said, 'Behold, I have defied the battle array of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.'
11 And when Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.
12 Now David was the son of a man, an Ephrathite, of Bethlehem in Judah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons.
13 And this man, in the days of Saul, had become an elder among men. And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the war: and the names of his sons that went to the war were Eliab his firstborn, and his second Abinadab, and his third Shammah.
