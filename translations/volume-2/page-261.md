Ἰεσιᾶ, καὶ Ἐλιὴλ, καὶ Ἰωζαὰρ, καὶ Ἰεσβαὰμ, οἱ Κορίται, καὶ Ἰωηλὰ, 7
καὶ Ζαβαδία υἱοὶ Ἱεροὰμ, υἱοὶ τοῦ Γεδώρ. Καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ 8
Γάδδι ἐχωρίσθησαν πρὸς Δαυὶδ ἐπὶ τῆς ἐρήμου ἰσχυροὶ, δυνατοὶ,
ἄνδρες παρατάξεως πολέμου, αἴροντες θυρεοὺς καὶ δόρατα, καὶ
πρόσωπον λέοντος τὰ πρόσωπα αὐτῶν, καὶ κοῦφοι ὡς δορκάδες
ἐπὶ τῶν ὀρέων ἐν τάχει. Ἀζὲρ δ᾽ ἄρχων, Ἀβδία δ᾽ δεύτερος, Ἐ- 9
λιὰβ δ᾽ τρίτος, Μασμὰν δ᾽ τέταρτος, Ἱερεμία δ᾽ πέμπτος, Ἐθθεὶ 10.11
δ᾽ ἕκτος, Ἐλιὴλ δ᾽ ἕβδομος, Ἰωνὰν δ᾽ ὄγδοος, Ἐλεζαβὰδ δ᾽ ἕνα- 12
τος, Ἱερεμίας δ᾽ δέκατος, Μαχαβαναὶ δ᾽ ἑνδέκατος. Οὗτοι ἐκ τῶν 13.14
υἱῶν Γὰδ, ἄρχοντες τῆς στρατιᾶς, εἰς τοῖς ἑκατὸν μικρὸς, καὶ μέ-
γας τοῖς χιλίοις. Οὗτοι οἱ διαβάντες τὸν Ἰορδάνην ἐν τῷ μηνὶ 15
τῷ πρώτῳ. Καὶ οὗτος πεπληρωκὼς ἐπὶ πᾶσαν κρηπῖδα αὐτοῦ.
καὶ ἐξεδίωξαν πάντας τοὺς κατοικοῦντας αὐλῶνας ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν
ἕως δυσμῶν. Καὶ ἦλθον ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν Βενιαμεὶν, καὶ Ἰούδα, εἰς 16
βοήθειαν τοῦ Δαυίδ. Καὶ Δαυὶδ ἐξῆλθεν εἰς ἀπάντησιν αὐτοῖς. καὶ 17
εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· εἰ εἰς εἰρήνην ἥκατε πρὸς με, εἰ ἐμοὶ καρδία καθ᾽ ἑαυτὴν ἐφ᾽ ὑμᾶς· καὶ εἰ τοῦ παραδοῦναί με τοῖς ἐχθροῖς μου, οὐκ
ἐν ἀληθείᾳ χειρὸς, ἴδοι ὁ Θεὸς τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν, καὶ ἐλέγξαι.
Καὶ πνεῦμα ἐνεδυνάμωσε τὸν Ἀμασαὶ τὸν ἄρχοντα τῶν τριάκον- 18
τα, καὶ εἶπε· πορεύου Δαυὶδ υἱὸς Ἰεσσαὶ, καὶ ὁ λαός σου· εἰρήνη
εἰρήνη σοι, εἰρήνη τοῖς βοηθοῖς σου, ὅτι ἐβοήθησέ σοι ὁ Θεός σου.
Καὶ προσεδέξατο αὐτοὺς Δαυὶδ, καὶ κατέστησεν αὐτοὺς ἄρχοντας
τῶν δυνάμεων. Καὶ ἀπὸ Μανασσῆ προσεχώρησαν πρὸς Δαυὶδ ἐν 19
τῷ ἐλθεῖν τοὺς ἀλλοφύλους ἐπὶ Σαοὺλ εἰς πόλεμον· καὶ οὐκ ἐβοή-
θησεν αὐτοῖς, ὅτι ἐν βουλῇ ἐγένετο παρὰ τῶν στρατηγῶν τῶν ἀλ-
λοφύλων λεγόντων, ἐν ταῖς κεφαλαῖς τῶν ἀνδρῶν ἐκείνων ἐπιστρέ-
ψει πρὸς τὸν Κύριον αὑτοῦ Σαούλ. Ἐν τῷ πορευθῆναι αὐτὸν εἰς 20
Σικελὰγ προσεχώρησαν αὐτῷ ἀπὸ Μανασσῆ, Ἑδνὰ, καὶ Ἰωζαβὰδ,
καὶ Ἰεδιὴλ, καὶ Μιχαὴλ, καὶ Ἰωζαβὲδ, καὶ Ἐλιοὺδ, καὶ Γαλαθί,
ἀρχηγοὶ χιλιάδων εἰσὶ τοῦ Μανασσῆ. Καὶ οὗτοι συνεμάχησαν τῷ 21
Δαυὶδ ἐπὶ τὸν Γεδδοὺρ, ὅτι δυνατοὶ ἰσχύος πάντες· καὶ ἦσαν ἡγού-
μενοι ἐπὶ τῇ στρατιᾷ, ὅτι ἡμέραν ἐξ ἡμέρας ἤρχοντο πρὸς Δαυὶδ 22
εἰς δύναμιν μεγάλην ὡς δύναμις Θεοῦ. Καὶ ταῦτα τὰ ὀνόματα 23
τῶν ἀρχόντων τῆς στρατιᾶς, οἱ ἐλθόντες πρὸς Δαυὶδ εἰς Χεβρὼν,
τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι τὴν βασιλείαν Σαοὺλ πρὸς αὐτὸν, κατὰ τὸν λόγον
Κυρίου. Υἱοὶ Ἰούδα θυρεοφόροι, ἓξ χιλιάδες καὶ ὀκτακόσιοι, δυνα- 24
τοῦ παρατάξεως.

**English Translation:**

**Chapter 12**

**7** Jesiah, and Eliel, and Jozaar, and Jesbaam, the Korites, and Joela,
**8** and Zabadias, the sons of Jeroam, the sons of Geddor.
Now from among the Gadites were there separated unto David, in the wilderness, men of might and valour,
**9** men arrayed for battle; bearing shields and spears,
**10** whose faces were as the face of a lion, and they were swift as gazelles
**11** upon the mountains in their speed. Azael the chief, Abdias the second,
**12** Eliab the third, Masman the fourth, Jeremias the fifth, Etthei the sixth, Eliel the seventh, Jonan the eighth, Elezabad the ninth,
**13** Jeremias the tenth, Machabanai the eleventh.
**14** These were of the sons of Gad, captains of the army; the least among them accounted for a hundred, and the greatest for a thousand.
**15** These are they who did cross the Jordan in the first month. And the river had then overflowed all its banks. And they did drive out all those dwelling in the valleys, from the east even unto the west.
**16** And there came from the sons of Benjamin, and of Judah, to the help of David.
**17** And David went forth to meet them; and he said unto them: "If ye be come to me in peace, and if my heart be truly with you; but if [ye be come] to betray me to mine enemies, not with a hand of truth, may the God of our fathers behold [it], and rebuke [it]."
**18** And the Spirit empowered Amasai, the chief of the thirty, and he said: "Go forth, David, son of Jesse, and thy people! Peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be unto thy helpers; for thy God hath helped thee."
**19** And David received them, and made them captains of the forces.
And from Manasseh, there came over to David when the Philistines came against Saul to war; yet he helped them not,
**20** for it was by counsel decided among the generals of the Philistines, saying: "Upon the heads of these men shall he turn back unto his own lord, Saul."
When he went to Ziklag, there came over to him from Manasseh: Edna, and Jozabad,
**21** and Jediel, and Michael, and Jozabed, and Elioud, and Galathi, who were chiefs of thousands of Manasseh. And these did help David against the Geddour [band of raiders], for they were all men of great strength;
**22** and they were leaders over the army, for day by day there came unto David a great host, like unto the host of God.
**23** And these are the names of the chiefs of the army, who came to David to Hebron, to turn over the kingdom of Saul unto him, according to the word of the Lord.
**24** The sons of Judah, shield-bearers, six thousand and eight hundred, mighty for battle array.
