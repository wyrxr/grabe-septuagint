636 ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Γ΄. ΚΕΦ. ΙΔ΄.
τῇ πόλει, καταφάγονται οἱ κύνες, καὶ τὸν τεθνηκότα ἐν τῷ ἀγρῷ
12 καταφάγονται τὰ πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, ὅτι Κύριος ἐλάλησε. Καὶ
σὺ ἀναστᾶσα πορεύθητι εἰς τὸν οἶκόν σου· ἐν τῷ εἰσέρχεσθαι πό-
13 δα σου τὴν πόλιν, ἀποθανεῖται τὸ παιδάριον. Καὶ κόψονται αὐ-
τὸν πᾶς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ θάψουσιν αὐτόν, ὅτι οὗτος μόνος εἰσελεύ-
σεται τῷ Ἱεροβοὰμ πρὸς τάφον, ὅτι εὑρέθη ἐν αὐτῷ ῥῆμα καλὸν
14 περὶ τοῦ Κυρίου Θεοῦ Ἰσραὴλ ἐν οἴκῳ Ἱεροβοάμ. Καὶ ἀναστήσει
Κύριος ἑαυτῷ βασιλέα ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ, ὃς πλήξει τὸν οἶκον Ἱεροβο-
15 ὰμ ταύτῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ· καὶ τί, καὶ νῦν; Κύριος πλήξει τὸν Ἰσρα-
ὴλ καθὰ κινεῖται ὁ κάλαμος ἐν τῷ ὕδατι· καὶ ἐκτιλεῖ τὸν Ἰσ-
ραὴλ ἀπὸ ἄνω τῆς χθονὸς τῆς ἀγαθῆς ταύτης, ἧς ἔδωκε τοῖς
πατράσιν αὐτῶν· καὶ λικμήσει αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ πέραν τοῦ ποταμοῦ,
ἀνθ᾿ οὗ ὅσον ἐποίησαν τὰ ἄλση αὐτῶν, παροργίζοντες τὸν Κύριον.
16 Καὶ παραδώσει Κύριος τὸν Ἰσραὴλ χάριν ἁμαρτιῶν Ἱεροβοάμ, ὃς
17 ἥμαρτε, καὶ ὃς ἐξημάρτε τὸν Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἀνέστη ἡ γυνὴ Ἱε-
ροβοάμ, καὶ ἐπορεύθη εἰς γῆν Σαριρά· καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς εἰσῆλθεν
18 ἐν τῷ προθύρῳ τοῦ οἴκου, καὶ τὸ παιδάριον ἀπέθανε. Καὶ ἔθα-
ψαν αὐτόν, καὶ ἐκόψαντο αὐτὸν πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα Κυ-
ρίου, ὃ ἐλάλησεν ἐν χειρὶ δούλου αὐτοῦ Ἀχιὰ τοῦ προφήτου. Καὶ
19 περισσὸν ῥημάτων Ἱεροβοὰμ ὅσα ἐπολέμησε, καὶ ὅσα ἐβασίλευ-
σεν, ἰδοὺ αὐτὰ γεγραμμένα ἐπὶ βιβλίου ῥημάτων τῶν ἡμερῶν τῶν
20 βασιλέων Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ αἱ ἡμέραι ἃς ἐβασίλευσεν Ἱεροβοάμ, εἴκο-
σι δύο ἔτη· καὶ ἐκοιμήθη μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐβασίλευ-
21 σε Ναδὰβ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀντ᾽ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ Ῥοβοὰμ υἱὸς Σαλωμὼν
ἐβασίλευσεν ἐπὶ Ἰούδαν· υἱὸς τεσσαράκοντα καὶ ἑνὸς ἐνιαυτῶν Ῥο-
βοὰμ ἐν τῷ βασιλεύειν αὐτόν· καὶ ἑπτακαίδεκα ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν
ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ τῇ πόλει, ἣν ἐξελέξατο Κύριος θέσθαι τὸ ὄνομα
αὐτοῦ ἐκεῖ ἐκ πασῶν φυλῶν τοῦ Ἰσραήλ· καὶ ὄνομα τῆς
22 μητρὸς αὐτοῦ Νααμὰ ἡ Ἀμανῖτις. Καὶ ἐποίησε Ῥοβοὰμ τὸ πο-
νηρὸν ἐνώπιον Κυρίου· καὶ παρεζήλωσαν αὐτὸν ἐν πᾶσιν οἷς ἐποί-
ησαν οἱ πατέρες αὐτῶν καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις αὐτῶν αἷς ἥμαρ-
23 τον. Καὶ ᾠκοδόμησαν καὶ αὐτοὶ ἑαυτοῖς ὑψηλά, καὶ στήλας, καὶ
ἄλση ἐπὶ πάντα βουνὸν ὑψηλόν, καὶ ὑποκάτω παντὸς ξύλου συ-
24 σκίου. Καὶ σύνδεσμος ἐγενήθη ἐν τῇ γῇ, καὶ ἐποίησαν ἀπὸ πάν-
των τῶν ἐδελυγμάτων τῶν ἐθνῶν ὧν ἐξῆρε Κύριος ἀπὸ προσώ-
25 που υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἐνιαυτῷ τῷ πέμπτῳ βα-

### 1 Kings

**11** (Continued from previous verse)
...[them that die] in the city, shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field,

**12** shall the fowls of the heaven consume; for the LORD hath spoken it. And thou, arise and get thee to thine house; for it shall come to pass, as thy foot entereth the city, that the child shall die.

**13** And all Israel shall mourn for him, and shall bury him: for he only of Jeroboam's house shall come to the grave; because in him was found a good inclination toward the LORD God of Israel, even in the house of Jeroboam.

**14** And the LORD shall raise Him up a king over Israel, who shall smite the house of Jeroboam in that day; and what [more need be said]? Even now [it beginneth].

**15** The LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water; and He shall root up Israel from off this good land, which He gave unto their fathers; and shall scatter them beyond the River, because they have made their sacred groves, thereby provoking the LORD to wrath.

**16** And the LORD shall give Israel over on account of the sins of Jeroboam, who did himself sin, and who made Israel to sin.

**17** And the wife of Jeroboam arose, and departed unto the land of Sarira; and it came to pass, as she entered

**18** into the threshold of the house, that the child died. And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of the LORD, which He had spoken by the hand of His servant Ahijah the prophet.

**19** Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.

**20** And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years; and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.

**21** And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put His Name there. And his mother's name was Naamah, an Ammonitess.

**22** And Rehoboam did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD. And they provoked Him to jealousy with all the abominations which their fathers had done, yea, and with their own sins which they had committed.

**23** For they also built for themselves high places, and sacred pillars, and cultic groves upon every high hill and under every luxuriant tree.

**24** And [spiritual] bonds were established in the land; and they wrought after all the abominations of the nations, whom the LORD had cast out from before the face of the children of Israel.

**25** And it came to pass in the fifth year of the reign of King Rehoboam,
