ΚΕΦ. ΚΔʹ. ΚΕʹ. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Αʹ. 531
αὑτῷ ἀγαθὰ καθὼς πεποίηκας σήμερον. Καὶ νῦν ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ γινώ- 21
σκω, ὅτι βασιλεύων βασιλεύσεις, καὶ στήσεται ἐν χερσί σου βασι-
λεία Ἰσραήλ· καὶ νῦν ὄμοσόν μοι ἐν Κυρίῳ, ὅτι οὐκ ἐξολοθρεύ- 22
σεις τὸ σπέρμα μου ὀπίσω μου, καὶ οὐκ ἀφανιεῖς τὸ ὄνομά μου
ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ πατρός μου. Καὶ ὤμοσε Δαυὶδ τῷ Σαούλ, καὶ 23
ἀπῆλθε Σαοὺλ εἰς τὸν τόπον αὑτοῦ, καὶ Δαυὶδ καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες αὐ-
τοῦ ἀνέβησαν εἰς τὴν Μεσσαρὰ στενήν.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΕʹ. XXV.

ΚΑΙ ἀπέθανε Σαμουήλ, καὶ συναθροίζονται πᾶς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ 1
κόπτονται αὑτόν, καὶ θάπτουσιν αὑτὸν ἐν οἴκῳ αὑτοῦ ἐν Ῥαμᾷ.
Καὶ ἀνέστη Δαυίδ, καὶ κατέβη εἰς τὴν ἔρημον Φαράν. Καὶ ἦν 2
ἄνθρωπος ἐν Μαῶν, καὶ τὰ ποίμνια αὑτοῦ ἐν τῷ Καρμήλῳ,
καὶ ὁ ἄνθρωπος μέγας σφόδρα, καὶ τούτῳ ποίμνια τρισχίλια, καὶ
χίλιαι αἶγες. Καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐν τῷ κείρειν τὰ ποίμνια αὑτοῦ ἐν τῷ
Καρμήλῳ, καὶ ὄνομα τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ Νάβαλ, καὶ ὄνομα τῇ γυναι- 3
κὶ αὑτοῦ Ἀβιγαία. Καὶ ἡ γυνὴ αὑτοῦ ἀγαθὴ τῇ συνέσει, καὶ κα-
λὴ τῷ εἴδει σφόδρα· καὶ ὁ ἄνθρωπος πονηρὸς καὶ σκληρὸς ἐν ἐπι-
τηδεύμασι, καὶ ὁ ἄνθρωπος κυνικός. Καὶ ἤκουσε Δαυὶδ ἐν τῇ ἐρή- 4
μῳ, ὅτι κείρει Νάβαλ ὁ Καρμήλιος τὸ ποίμνιον αὑτοῦ· καὶ ἀ- 5
πέστειλε Δαυὶδ δέκα παιδάρια, καὶ εἶπε Δαυὶδ τοῖς παιδαρίοις·
Ἀνάβητε εἰς Κάρμηλον, καὶ ἀπέλθατε πρὸς Νάβαλ, καὶ ἐρωτή-
σατε αὑτὸν ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί μου εἰς εἰρήνην, καὶ ἐρεῖτε τάδε· εἰς 6
ὥρας καὶ σὺ ὑγιαίνων καὶ ὁ οἶκός σου, καὶ πάντα τὰ σὰ ὑγιαί-
νοντα. Καὶ νῦν ἰδοὺ ἀκήκοα ὅτι κείρουσί σοι νῦν οἱ ποιμένες σου 7
οἳ ἦσαν μεθ᾽ ἡμῶν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, καὶ οὐκ ἀπεκωλύσαμεν αὑτούς,
καὶ οὐκ ἐνετειλάμεθα αὑτοῖς οὐδὲν πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας ὄντων αὑ-
τῶν ἐν Καρμήλῳ· ἐρώτησον τὰ παιδάριά σου, καὶ ἀπαγγελοῦσί 8
σοι, καὶ εὑρέτωσαν τὰ παιδάρια χάριν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς σου, ὅτι ἐφ᾽
ἡμέραν ἀγαθὴν ἥκομεν· δὸς δὴ ὃ ἂν εὕρῃ ἡ χείρ σου τοῖς παι-
σί σου, καὶ τῷ υἱῷ σου τῷ Δαυίδ. Καὶ ἔρχονται τὰ παιδάρια 9
Δαυὶδ καὶ λαλοῦσι πρὸς Νάβαλ κατὰ πάντα τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα ἐν
τῷ ὀνόματι Δαυίδ· καὶ ἀνεπηδήσε, καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Νάβαλ τοῖς παι- 10
σὶ Δαυίδ, καὶ εἶπε· τίς Δαυίδ, καὶ τίς υἱὸς Ἰεσσαί; σήμερον πε-
πληθυσμένοι εἰσὶν οἱ δοῦλοι, ἀναχωροῦντες ἕκαστος ἐκ προσώπου

**21** unto him good, even as thou hast done this day. And now, behold, I know that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand.
**22** Now therefore, swear unto me by the Lord, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father's house."
**23** And David swore unto Saul. And Saul went unto his own place, but David and his men went up unto the narrow Messara.

### CHAPTER XXV.

**1** And Samuel died; and all Israel were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him in his own house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.
**2** And there was a man in Maon, whose flocks were in Carmel; and the man was exceeding great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats. And it came to pass, as he was shearing his flocks in Carmel,
**3** that the name of the man was Nabal, and the name of his wife Abigail. And the woman was of good understanding, and very beautiful of countenance; but the man was evil and harsh in [his] dealings, yea, the man was a Cynic.
**4** And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal the Carmelite did shear his flocks.
**5** And David sent ten young men, and David said unto the young men, "Go up to Carmel, and come unto Nabal, and greet him in my name with peace, and ye shall say thus:
**6** 'May it be well with thee through the seasons, and mayest thou be in good health, and thy house, and all that is thine in health.'
**7** And now, behold, I have heard that thy shepherds do shear [their sheep] for thee this day; and they were with us in the wilderness, and we did not hinder them,
**8** nor did we lay any burden upon them all the days that they were in Carmel. Ask thy young men, and they will declare unto thee. Wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes, for we are come on a good day. Give, I pray thee, whatsoever thy hand may find unto thy servants, and to thy son David."
**9** So David's young men came and spoke unto Nabal according to all these words in the name of David.
**10** And Nabal sprang up, and answered David's servants, and said, "Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? Today are there many servants, who break away each from the presence of his master.
