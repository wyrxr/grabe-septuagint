πολεμῆσαι ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ Μαγγεδδώ. Καὶ ἐτόξευσαν οἱ τοξόται ἐπὶ 23
βασιλέα Ἰωσίαν, καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τοῖς παισὶν ἑαυτοῦ· ἐξ-
αγάγετέ με, ὅτι ἐπόνεσα σφόδρα. Καὶ ἐξήγαγον αὐτὸν οἱ παῖδες 24
αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἅρματος, καὶ ἀνεβίβασαν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὸ ἅρμα τὸ δευ-
τερεῦον ὃ ἦν αὐτῷ, καὶ ἤγαγον αὐτὸν εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἀπέθα-
νε, καὶ ἐτάφη μετὰ τῶν πατέρων ἑαυτοῦ· καὶ πᾶς Ἰούδα καὶ Ἱε-
ρουσαλὴμ ἐπένθησαν ἐπὶ Ἰωσίαν. Καὶ ἐθρήνησεν Ἱερεμίας ἐπὶ Ἰω- 25
σίαν, καὶ εἶπαν πάντες οἱ ἄρχοντες καὶ αἱ ἄρχουσαι θρῆνον ἐπὶ
Ἰωσίαν ἕως τῆς σήμερον· καὶ ἔδωκαν αὐτὸν εἰς πρόσταγμα ἐπὶ
Ἰσραήλ· καὶ ἰδοὺ γέγραπται ἐπὶ τῶν θρήνων. Καὶ ἦσαν οἱ λοιποὶ 26
λόγοι Ἰωσία καὶ ἡ ἐλπὶς αὐτοῦ γεγραμμένα ἐν νόμῳ Κυρίου, καὶ οἱ 27
λοιποὶ λόγοι αὐτοῦ οἱ πρῶτοι καὶ οἱ ἔσχατοι ἰδοὺ γεγραμμένοι ἐπὶ
βιβλίῳ βασιλέων Ἰσραὴλ καὶ Ἰούδα.

ΚΕΦ. ΛΣ΄. XXXVI.
ΚΑΙ ἔλαβεν ὁ λαὸς τῆς γῆς τὸν Ἰωάχαζ υἱὸν Ἰωσίου, καὶ 1
ἔχρισαν αὐτὸν εἰς βασιλέα ἀντὶ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ.
Υἱὸς εἴκοσι καὶ τριῶν ἐτῶν Ἰωάχαζ ἐν τῷ βασιλεύειν αὐτόν, καὶ 2
τρίμηνον ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ὄνομα τῆς μητρὸς αὐ-
τοῦ Ἀμιτάλ, θυγάτηρ Ἱερεμίου ἐκ Λοβνά. Καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ πο-
νηρὸν ἐνώπιον Κυρίου κατὰ πάντα ἃ ἐποίησαν οἱ πατέρες αὐτοῦ.
Καὶ ἔδησεν αὐτὸν Φαραὼ Νεχαὼ ἐν Δεβλαθὰ ἐν γῇ Αἱμάθ, τοῦ μὴ
βασιλεύειν αὐτὸν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ μετήγαγεν αὐτὸν ὁ βασι- 3
λεὺς εἰς Αἴγυπτον, καὶ ἐπέβαλε φόρον ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ἑκατὸν τάλαν-
τα ἀργυρίου καὶ τάλαντον χρυσίου. Καὶ κατέστησε Φαραὼ Νεχαὼ 4
τὸν Ἐλιακεὶμ υἱὸν Ἰωσίου βασιλέα ἐπὶ Ἰούδα ἀντὶ Ἰωσίου τοῦ
πατρὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ μετέστρεφε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ἰωακείμ. καὶ τὸν
Ἰωάχαζ ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ ἔλαβε Φαραὼ Νεχαώ, καὶ εἰσήγαγεν αὐ-
τὸν εἰς Αἴγυπτον, καὶ ἀπέθανεν ἐκεῖ, καὶ τὸ ἀργύριον καὶ τὸ χρυ-
σίον ἔδωκαν τῷ Φαραώ. τότε ἤρξατο ἡ γῆ φορολογεῖσθαι τοῦ
δοῦναι τὸ ἀργύριον ἐπὶ στόμα Φαραώ· καὶ ἕκαστος κατὰ δύναμιν
ἀπῄτει τὸ ἀργύριον καὶ τὸ χρυσίον παρὰ τοῦ λαοῦ τῆς γῆς, δοῦ-
ναι αὐτὸ Φαραὼ Νεχαώ. Ὃν εἴκοσι καὶ πέντε ἐτῶν Ἰωακεὶμ ἐν 5
τῷ βασιλεύειν αὐτόν, καὶ ἔνδεκα ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ,
καὶ ὄνομα τῆς μητρὸς αὐτοῦ Ζεχωρά, θυγάτηρ Νηρίου ἐκ Ῥαμά.

**Chapter 35 [continued]**

²²...to fight in the plain of Megiddo.

²³ And the archers shot at King Josiah; and the king said unto his servants, 'Lead me forth, for I am sore wounded.'

²⁴ And his servants took him out of the chariot, and brought him up into the second chariot which he had, and brought him to Jerusalem; and he died, and was buried with his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.

²⁵ And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah; and all the princes and the princesses spoke a lamentation for Josiah unto this day. And they made him an ordinance concerning Israel; and behold, it is written in the Lamentations.

²⁶ Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his hope, were written in the Law of the LORD.

²⁷ And the rest of his acts, the first and the last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.

**Chapter 36**

¹ Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him king in the stead of his father in Jerusalem.

² Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.

³ And Pharaoh Necho bound him in Diblah, in the land of Hamath, that he should not reign in Jerusalem. And the king carried him away into Egypt, and laid a tribute upon the land of a hundred talents of silver and one talent of gold.

⁴ And Pharaoh Necho made Eliakim the son of Josiah king over Judah in the stead of Josiah his father; and he turned his name to Jehoiakim. And Pharaoh Necho took Jehoahaz his brother, and brought him into Egypt; and he died there. And they gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh. Then the land began to be taxed, to give the silver at the word of Pharaoh; and each man, according to his ability, demanded the silver and the gold from the people of the land, to give it to Pharaoh Necho.

⁵ Whom, being twenty and five years old, Jehoiakim began to reign; and eleven years he reigned in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Zechorah, the daughter of Neriyah of Ramah.
