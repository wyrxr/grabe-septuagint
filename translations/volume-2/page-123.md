ΚΕΦ. Α΄. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Γ΄. 599
καὶ οὐκ ἐγνώρισας τῷ δούλῳ σου τίς καθήσεται ἐπὶ τὸν θρόνον τοῦ
κυρίου μου τοῦ βασιλέως μετ᾽ αὐτόν;
28 Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη ὁ βασιλεὺς Δαυίδ, καὶ εἶπε· καλέσατέ μοι τὴν Βηθσαβέε. Καὶ εἰσῆλθεν ἐνώπιον τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ ἔστη ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ.
29 Καὶ ὤμοσεν ὁ βασιλεύς, καὶ εἶπε· ζῇ Κύριος ὃς ἐλυτρώσατο τὴν ψυχήν μου ἐκ πάσης θλίψεως,
30 ὅτι καθὼς ὤμοσά σοι ἐν Κυρίῳ Θεῷ Ἰσραήλ, λέγων, ὅτι Σαλωμὼν ὁ υἱός σου βασιλεύσει μετ᾽ ἐμέ, καὶ αὐτὸς καθήσεται ἐπὶ τοῦ θρόνου μου ἀντ᾽ ἐμοῦ, ὅτι οὕτως ποιήσω τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ταύτῃ.
31 Καὶ ἔκυψε Βηθσαβεὲ ἐπὶ πρόσωπον ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, καὶ προσεκύνησε τῷ βασιλεῖ, καὶ εἶπε· ζήτω ὁ κύριός μου ὁ βασιλεύς Δαυίδ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα.
32 Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Δαυίδ· καλέσατέ μοι Σαδὼκ τὸν ἱερέα, καὶ Νάθαν τὸν προφήτην, καὶ Βαναίαν υἱὸν Ἰωιαδαέ. Καὶ εἰσῆλθον ἐνώπιον τοῦ βασιλέως.
33 Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς αὐτοῖς· λάβετε μεθ᾽ ὑμῶν τοὺς δούλους τοῦ κυρίου ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐπιβιβάσατε Σαλωμὼν τὸν υἱόν μου ἐπὶ τὴν ἡμίονον τὴν ἐμήν, καὶ καταγάγετε αὐτὸν εἰς τὸν Γιῶν,
34 καὶ χρίσατω αὐτὸν ἐκεῖ Σαδὼκ ὁ ἱερεύς, καὶ Νάθαν ὁ προφήτης εἰς βασιλέα ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ σαλπίσατε κερατίνῃ, καὶ ἐρεῖτε· ζήτω ὁ βασιλεὺς Σαλωμών.
35 Καὶ ἀναβήσεσθε ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἰσελεύσεται καὶ καθήσεται ἐπὶ τοῦ θρόνου μου, καὶ αὐτὸς βασιλεύσει ἀντὶ ἐμοῦ· καὶ ἐγὼ ἐνετειλάμην τοῦ εἶναι ἡγούμενον ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ καὶ ἐπὶ Ἰούδαν.
36 Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Βαναίας υἱὸς Ἰωιαδαὲ τῷ βασιλεῖ, καὶ εἶπε· γένοιτο· οὕτως πιστώσαι Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ κυρίου μου τοῦ βασιλέως.
37 Καθὼς ἦν Κύριος μετὰ τοῦ κυρίου μου τοῦ βασιλέως, οὕτως εἴη μετὰ Σαλωμών, καὶ μεγαλύναι τὸν θρόνον αὐτοῦ ὑπὲρ τὸν θρόνον τοῦ κυρίου μου τοῦ βασιλέως Δαυίδ.
38 Καὶ κατέβη Σαδὼκ ὁ ἱερεύς, καὶ Νάθαν ὁ προφήτης, καὶ Βαναίας υἱὸς Ἰωιαδαέ, καὶ ὁ Χερεθεΐ, καὶ ὁ Φελεθεῖ καὶ ἐπεκάθισαν τὸν Σαλωμὼν ἐπὶ τὴν ἡμίονον τοῦ βασιλέως Δαυίδ, καὶ ἀπήγαγον αὐτὸν εἰς τὸν Γιών.
39 Καὶ ἔλαβε Σαδὼκ ὁ ἱερεὺς τὸ κέρας τοῦ ἐλαίου ἐκ τῆς σκηνῆς, καὶ ἔχρισε τὸν Σαλωμών, καὶ ἐσάλπισε τῇ κερατίνῃ. Καὶ εἶπε πᾶς ὁ λαός· ζήτω ὁ βασιλεὺς Σαλωμών.
40 Καὶ ἀνέβη πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐχόρευον ἐν χοροῖς καὶ εὐφραινόμενοι εὐφροσύνην μεγάλην, καὶ ἐρράγη ἡ γῆ ἐν τῇ φωνῇ αὐτῶν.
41 Καὶ ἤκουσεν Ἀδωνίας, καὶ πάντες οἱ κλητοὶ αὑτοῦ, καὶ αὐτοὶ συνετέλεσαν φαγεῖν. Καὶ ἤκουσεν Ἰωὰβ τὴν φωνὴν

### A Royal Translation of the Third Book of Kingdoms, Chapter 1

**27** and thou hast not caused thy servant to know who shall sit upon the throne of my lord the King after him?"

**28** Then King David answered and said, "Call me Bathsheba." And she came in before the king, and stood before him.

**29** And the king sware, and said, "As the LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all trouble,
**30** surely as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying, 'Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he himself shall sit upon my throne in my stead'; even so will I certainly do this day."

**31** Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did obeisance to the king, and said, "Let my lord King David live for ever!"

**32** And King David said, "Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada." And they came in before the king.

**33** And the king said unto them, "Take with you the servants of your master, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon;
**34** and let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel; and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, 'God save King Solomon!'
**35** Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be leader over Israel and over Judah."

**36** And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, "Amen! So may the LORD God of my lord the King confirm it.
**37** As the LORD hath been with my lord the King, even so be He with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David."

**38** So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites went down, and set Solomon upon King David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.

**39** And Zadok the priest took a horn of oil out of the Tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, "God save King Solomon!"

**40** And all the people came up after him, and they danced in companies and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth was rent with the sound of them.

**41** And Adonijah heard, and all his invited guests, even as they had finished eating. And Joab heard the sound [of the trumpet],
