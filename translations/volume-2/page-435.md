καὶ οὐ προσθήσει, καὶ οὐ προνοήσει αὐτὸν ὁ τόπος αὐτοῦ οὐκέτι.
**10** Τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ θλάσειαν ἥττονες· αἱ δὲ χεῖρες αὐτοῦ πυρσεύσαισαν ὀδύνας.
**11** Ὀστᾶ αὐτοῦ ἐνεπλήσθη νεότητος αὐτοῦ, καὶ μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ χώματος κοιμηθήσεται.
**12** Ἐὰν γλυκανθῇ ἐν σώματι αὐτοῦ κακία, κρύψει αὐτὴν ὑπὸ τὴν γλῶσσαν αὐτοῦ·
**13** (οὐ) φείσεται αὐτῆς, καὶ οὐκ ἐγκαταλείψει αὐτήν, καὶ συνέξει αὐτὴν ἐν μέσω τοῦ λάρυγγος αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐ μὴ δυνηθῇ βοηθῆσαι ἑαυτῷ.
**14** Χολὴ ἀσπίδος ἐν γαστρὶ αὐτοῦ (καὶ πόνος)· πλοῦτος ἀδίκως συναγόμενος ἐξεμεθήσεται,
**15** ἐκ κοιλίας αὐτοῦ, (ἐξ οἰκίας δὲ αὐτοῦ) ἐξελκύσει αὐτὸν ἄγγελος (θανάτου.)
**16** Θυμὸν δὲ δρακόντων θηλάσει, καὶ ἀνέλοι αὐτὸν γλῶσσα ὄφεως.
**17** Μὴ ἴδοι ἀμελξιν νομάδων, μηδὲ νομάς μέλιτος καὶ βουτύρου.
**18** Εἰς κενὰ καὶ μάταια ἐκοπίασε (σχοίνη δὲ) πλοῦτον ἐξ οὗ οὐ γεύσεται, ὥσπερ στρύχνον ἀμάσητον, ἀκατάποτον·
**19** Πολλῶν γὰρ ἀδυνάτων οἴκους ἔθλασε, δίαιταν δὲ (αὐτῶν) ἥρπασε, καὶ οὐκ ἔστησε.
**20** Διὰ τοῦτο οὐκ ἔσται αὐτῷ σωτηρία ἐν τοῖς ὑπάρχουσιν αὐτοῦ, (οὐδὲ ἀνθήσει αὐτοῦ τὰ ἀγαθά·) ἐν ἐπιθυμίᾳ αὐτοῦ οὐ σωθήσεται.
**21** Οὐκ ἔστιν ὑπόλειμμα τοῖς βρώμασιν αὐτοῦ· διὰ τοῦτο οὐκ ἀνθήσει αὐτοῦ τὰ ἀγαθά.
**22** Ὅταν δοκῇ ἤδη πεπληρῶσθαι, θλιβήσεται· πᾶσα δὲ ἀνάγκη ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸν ἐπελεύσεται, εἰ πως εἴ πληρῶσαι γαστέρα αὐτοῦ.
**23** Ἐπαποστείλαι ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸν θυμὸν ὀργῆς, ῥίψαι δὲ ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸν ὀδύνας·
**24** καὶ οὐ μὴ σωθῇ ἐκ χειρὸς σιδήρου, τρώσαι (δὲ) αὐτὸν τόξον χάλκεον,
**25** καὶ διεξέλθοι διὰ σώματος αὐτοῦ βέλος. Ἀστραπὴ δὲ ἐν διαίταις αὐτοῦ (μὴ) περιπατήσαι· ἐπ᾽ αὐτῷ φόβοι, καὶ πᾶν σκότος αὐτὸν ὑπομείναι·
**26** κατέδεται (δὲ) αὐτὸν πῦρ ἄσβεστον, καὶ κακώσαι αὐτοῦ ἐπήλυτος τὸν οἶκον.
**27** Ἀνακαλύψαι αὐτοῦ ὁ οὐρανὸς τὰς ἀνομίας· γῆ δὲ ἐπανασταίη αὐτῷ.
**28** Ἐλκύσαι τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ ἀπώλεια εἰς τέλος· (καὶ) ἡμέρα ὀργῆς ἐπέλθοι αὐτῷ.
**29** Αὕτη ἡ μερὶς ἀνθρώπου ἀσεβοῦς παρὰ Κυρίου, καὶ κτῆμα ὑπαρχόντων αὐτοῦ παρὰ τοῦ ἐπισκόπου.

**1** ὙΠΟΛΑΒΩΝ δὲ Ἰώβ, λέγει· ἀκούσατέ (μου) ἀκούσατέ μου
**2** τῶν λόγων, ἵνα μὴ εἴη μοι αὕτη παρ᾽ ὑμῶν παράκλησις.
**3** Βασάσάτέ με, ἐγὼ δὲ λαλήσω· εἶτα μή μου καταγελᾶτε.
**4** Τί γάρ; μὴ (ἐξ) ἀνθρώπου ὁ ἔλεγξίς μου; καὶ διατὶ οὐ θυμωθήσομαι;
**5** Ἐμβλέφαντες εἰς ἐμὲ θαυμάσατε, χεῖρα θέντες ἐπὶ σιαγόνη.

## CHAPTER XX.

**9** and he shall add no more; neither shall his place acknowledge him any longer.
**10** May lesser ones crush his sons; and may his own hands cause sorrows to burn.
**11** His bones were filled with his youth, and with him shall it lie down upon the dust.
**12** If wickedness be sweet within his body, he shall hide it beneath his tongue.
**13** He shall (not) spare it, neither shall he forsake it; and he shall hold it fast within his throat, yet shall he not be able to help himself.
**14** The gall of an asp shall be in his belly (and pain); wealth unjustly gathered shall he vomit forth,
**15** from his belly; (yea, and from his house) an angel (of death) shall draw him forth.
**16** And he shall suck the wrath of dragons; and the tongue of a serpent shall slay him.
**17** May he not see the milking of flocks, neither streams of honey and butter.
**18** He hath toiled for empty and vain things; (yea, a measuring line of) wealth from which he shall not taste, like a nightshade unchewed, and impossible to swallow.
**19** For he hath crushed the houses of many helpless ones, and hath seized their sustenance; and he hath not established [them].
**20** Therefore shall there be no salvation for him in his possessions; (nor shall his good things flourish;) in his desire shall he not be saved.
**21** There shall be no remnant for his food; therefore shall his good things not flourish.
**22** When he thinketh himself already filled, he shall be afflicted; and every tribulation shall come upon him, if perchance he might fill his belly.
**23** May He send forth upon him the fury of His wrath, and cast upon him sorrows;
**24** and he shall not be saved from the hand of iron; (yea,) a bow of bronze shall wound him,
**25** and an arrow shall pass through his body. And may lightning (not) walk in his dwellings; fears [shall be] upon him, and all darkness shall endure him.
**26** And unquenchable fire shall consume him; and a stranger shall afflict his house.
**27** May the heaven reveal his iniquities; and may the earth rise up against him.
**28** May destruction draw his house to its utter end; (and) may the day of wrath come upon him.
**29** This is the portion of the ungodly man from the Lord, and the possession of his belongings from the Overseer.

## CHAPTER XXI.

**1** Then Job answered and said, Hearken (unto me), hearken unto my words,
**2** that this may not be [my] consolation from you.
**3** Question me, and I will speak; then mock me not.
**4** For what [ails me]? Is my complaint (indeed) from man? And why shall I not be angry?
**5** Gaze upon me, and be astonished, laying a hand upon your jaw.
