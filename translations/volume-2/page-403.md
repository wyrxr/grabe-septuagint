ἐλάλησεν Ἐσθὴρ πάντας τοὺς λόγους τούτους. Εἶπε δὲ Ἐσθὴρ 10
πρὸς Ἀχραδαῖον· πορεύθητι πρὸς Μαρδοχαῖον, καὶ εἰπὸν, ὅτι 11
πάντα τὰ ἔθνη τῆς βασιλείας γιγνώσκει, ὅτι πᾶς ἄνθρωπος καὶ
γυνὴ ὃς εἰσελεύσεται πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα εἰς τὴν αὐλὴν τὴν ἐσωτέ-
ραν ἄκλητος, οὐκ ἔξιν αὐτῷ σωτηρία. πλὴν ᾧ ἐκτείνῃ ὁ βασιλεὺς
τὴν χρυσῆν ῥάβδον, αὐτὸς σωθήσεται· καὶ ἐγὼ οὐκ ἐκλήθην εἰσελ-
θεῖν πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα, εἰσὶν αὗται ἡμέραι τριάκοντα. Καὶ ἀπήγ- 12
γειλεν Ἀχραδαῖος Μαρδοχαίῳ πάντας τοὺς λόγους Ἐσθήρ. Καὶ 13
εἶπε Μαρδοχαῖος πρὸς Ἀχραδαῖον· πορεύθητι, καὶ εἰπὸν αὐτῇ,
Ἐσθὴρ, μὴ εἴπῃς σεαυτῇ, ὅτι σωθήσομαι μόνη ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ
παρὰ πάντας τοὺς Ἰουδαίους. ῞Οτι ἐὰν παρακούσασα παρακούσῃς 14
ἐν τούτῳ τῷ καιρῷ, ἄλλοθεν (δὲ) βοήθεια καὶ σκέπη ἔσται τοῖς
Ἰουδαίοις· σὺ δὲ, καὶ ὁ οἶκος τοῦ πατρός σου ἀπολεῖσθε· καὶ τίς
οἶδεν, εἰ εἰς τὸν καιρὸν τοῦτον ἐβασίλευσας; Καὶ εἶπεν Ἐσθὴρ 15
ἐξαποστεῖλαι τὸν ἥκοντα, πρὸς Μαρδοχαῖον, λέγουσα πάλιν· βα- 16
δίσας ἐκκλησίασον τοὺς Ἰουδαίους τοὺς ἐν Σούσοις, καὶ νηστεύσα-
τε ἐπ᾽ ἐμοὶ, καὶ μὴ φάγητε, μηδὲ πίητε, ἐφ᾽ ἡμέρας τρεῖς νύκτα
καὶ ἡμέραν· καὶ ἐγὼ δὲ καὶ αἱ ἄβραι μου ἀσιτήσομεν· καὶ τότε
εἰσελεύσομαι πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα παρὰ τὸν νόμον, ἐὰν καὶ ἀπολέ-
σθαι με δέῃ. Καὶ βαδίσας Μαρδοχαῖος ἐποίησεν ὅσα ἐνετείλατο 17
αὐτῷ Ἐσθήρ. Καὶ Μαρδοχαῖος ἐδεήθη Κυρίου, μνημονεύων πάν-
τα τὰ ἔργα Κυρίου, καὶ εἶπε· Κύριε Θεὲ Κύριε βασιλεὺς πάντων
κρατῶν, ὅτι ἐν ἐξουσία σου τὸ πᾶν ἐστι, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ὁ ἀντιδο-
ξῶν σοι ἐν τῷ θέλειν σε σῶσαι τὸν Ἰσραήλ· ὅτι σὺ ἐποίησας τὸν
οὐρανὸν καὶ τὴν γῆν, καὶ πᾶν θαυμαζόμενον ἐν τῇ ὑπ᾽ οὐρανῷ·
Κύριος εἶ πάντων, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ὃς ἀντιτάξεται σοι τῷ Κυρίῳ·
σὺ πάντα γιγνώσκεις· σὺ οἶδας Κύριε, ὅτι οὐκ ἐν ὕβρει, οὐδὲ ἐν
ὑπερηφανείᾳ, οὐδὲ ἐν φιλοδοξίᾳ ἐποίησα τοῦτο, τὸ μὴ προσκυνεῖν
τὸν ὑπερήφανον Ἁμάν. ὅτι ηὐδόκουν φιλεῖν πέλματα ποδῶν αὐτοῦ
πρὸς σωτηρίαν Ἰσραήλ. ἀλλὰ ἐποίησα τοῦτο, ἵνα μὴ θῶ δόξαν
ἀνθρώπου ὑπεράνω δόξης Θεοῦ μου, καὶ οὐ προσκυνήσω οὐθένα,
πλὴν σοῦ τοῦ Κυρίου μου, καὶ οὐ ποιήσω αὐτὰ ἐν ὑπερηφανείᾳ.
καὶ νῦν Κύριε βασιλεὺς ὁ Θεὸς Ἀβραὰμ, φεῖσαι τοῦ λαοῦ σου,
ὅτι ἐπιβλέπουσιν ἡμῖν εἰς καταφθοράν, καὶ ἐπεθύμησαν ἀπολέσαι
τὴν ἐξ ἀρχῆς κληρονομίαν σου. μὴ ὑπερίδῃς τὴν μερίδα σου, ἣν σε-
αυτῷ ἐλυτρώσω ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου. ἐπάκουσον τῆς δεήσεώς μου,

Esther spake all these words [unto him].
<sup>10</sup> Then Esther said unto Achrabaios, "Go, and tell Mordecai,
<sup>11</sup> that all the nations of the king's dominion know, that whosoever, man or woman, shall come in unto the king into the inner court, uncalled, there is no way out unto salvation for him; save he to whom the king shall stretch forth the golden scepter, he shall be saved: and I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days."
<sup>12</sup> And Achrabaios reported unto Mordecai all the words of Esther.
<sup>13</sup> Then Mordecai said unto Achrabaios, "Go, and tell her, even Esther, 'Say not within thyself, that thou shalt escape in the king's house more than all the Jews.
<sup>14</sup> For if thou shalt altogether hold thy peace at this time, then shall there [indeed] arise help and deliverance to the Jews from another place; but thou, and thy father's house, ye shall perish: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?'"
<sup>15</sup> Then Esther bade [the messenger] return unto Mordecai, saying again:
<sup>16</sup> "Go, gather together the Jews that are found in Susa, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink for three days, night and day: and I also and my maidservants will fast likewise; and then will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law; and if I must perish, I perish."
<sup>17</sup> So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.

And Mordecai made supplication unto the Lord, calling to remembrance all the works of the Lord, and he said:

"O Lord, O God, O Lord, O King, Who rulest over all, for in Thy power is all [creation], and there is none that shall contend with Thee when Thou desirest to save Israel; for Thou hast made the heaven and the earth, and every wondrous thing that is under the heaven; Thou art Lord of all, and there is none who shall resist Thee, O Lord; Thou knowest all things; Thou knowest, O Lord, that not in pride, nor in arrogance, nor in vainglory did I do this, that I bowed not down to the arrogant Haman. For I was well content to kiss the soles of his feet for the salvation of Israel. But I did this, that I might not place the glory of man above the glory of my God, and I will worship none save Thee, my Lord, neither will I do these things in arrogance. And now, O Lord, O King, the God of Abraham, spare Thy people, for they gaze upon us to our destruction, and they have desired to destroy Thine inheritance from the beginning. Overlook not Thy portion, which Thou didst redeem for Thyself out of the land of Egypt. Hearken unto my supplication,"
