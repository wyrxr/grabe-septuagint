27 Ραββάθ υἱῶν Ἀμμών, καὶ κατέλαβε τὴν πόλιν τῆς βασιλείας. Καὶ
ἀπέστειλεν Ἰωὰβ ἀγγέλους πρὸς Δαυίδ, καὶ εἶπεν· ἐπολέμησα
28 πρὸς Ῥαββάθ, καὶ κατελαβόμην τὴν πόλιν τῶν ὑδάτων. Καὶ νῦν
σύναγε τὸ κατάλοιπον τοῦ λαοῦ, καὶ παρέμβαλε ἐπὶ τὴν πόλιν,
καὶ προκαταλαβοῦ αὐτήν, ἵνα μὴ προκαταλάβωμαι ἐγὼ τὴν πό-
29 λιν, καὶ κληθῇ τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐπ᾿ αὐτήν. Καὶ συνήγαγε Δαυίδ
πάντα τὸν λαόν, καὶ ἐπορεύθη πρὸς Ῥαββάθ, καὶ ἐπολέμησεν ἐν
30 αὐτῇ, καὶ κατελάβετο αὐτήν. Καὶ ἔλαβε τὸν στέφανον τοῦ βασι-
λέως αὐτῶν ἀπὸ τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὁ σταθμὸς αὐτοῦ τάλαν-
τον χρυσίου, καὶ λίθου τιμίου, καὶ ἦν ἐπὶ τῆς κεφαλῆς Δαυίδ,
31 καὶ σκῦλα τῆς πόλεως ἐξήνεγκε πολλὰ σφόδρα. Καὶ τὸν λαὸν
τὸν ἐν αὐτῇ ἐξήγαγε, καὶ ἔθηκεν ἐν τῷ πρίονι, καὶ ἐν τοῖς τρυ-
βόλοις τοῖς σιδηροῖς, καὶ διήγαγεν αὐτοὺς διὰ τοῦ πλινθίου. Καὶ
οὕτως ἐποίησε πάσαις ταῖς πόλεσιν υἱῶν Ἀμμών. Καὶ ἐπέστρε-
ψε Δαυίδ καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΓ΄. ΧΙΙΙ.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐγενήθη μετὰ ταῦτα καὶ τῷ Ἀβεσσαλὼμ υἱῷ Δαυίδ ἀ-
δελφὴ καλὴ τῷ εἴδει σφόδρα, καὶ ὄνομα αὐτῇ Θαμάρ, καὶ ἠγά-
2 πησεν αὐτὴν Ἀμνὼν υἱὸς Δαυίδ. Καὶ ἐθλίβετο Ἀμνὼν ὥστε ἀρ-
ρωστεῖν διὰ Θαμὰρ τὴν ἀδελφὴν αὐτοῦ, ὅτι παρθένος ἦν αὐτή,
καὶ ὑπέρογκον (καὶ) ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς Ἀμνὼν τοῦ ποιῆσαι αὐτῇ τί.
3 Καὶ ἦν τῷ Ἀμνὼν ἑταῖρος, καὶ ὄνομα αὐτῷ Ἰωναδάβ, υἱὸς Σα-
μαὰ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ Δαυίδ. Καὶ Ἰωναδὰβ ἀνὴρ σοφὸς σφόδρα, καὶ
4 εἶπεν αὐτῷ· τί σοι ὅτι σὺ οὕτως ἀσθενής, υἱὲ τοῦ βασιλέως, τὸ
πρωῒ πρωῒ; οὐχ ἀπαγγελεῖς μοι; καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Ἀμνών· Θαμὰρ
5 τὴν ἀδελφὴν Ἀβεσσαλὼμ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ μου ἐγὼ ἀγαπῶ. Καὶ εἶ-
πεν αὐτῷ Ἰωναδάβ· κοιμήθητι ἐπὶ τῆς κοίτης σου, καὶ μαλακί-
σθητι, καὶ εἰσελεύσεται ὁ πατήρ σου τοῦ ἰδεῖν σε, καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς
αὐτόν· ἐλθάτω δὴ Θαμὰρ ἡ ἀδελφή μου, καὶ ψωμισάτω με, καὶ
ποιησάτω κατ᾿ ὀφθαλμούς μου βρῶμα, ὅπως ἴδω καὶ φάγω ἐκ τῶν
6 χειρῶν αὐτῆς. Καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Ἀμνών, καὶ ἠρρώστησε, καὶ εἰσῆλ-
θεν ὁ βασιλεὺς ἰδεῖν αὐτόν. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἀμνὼν πρὸς τὸν βασι-
λέα· ἐλθάτω δὴ Θαμὰρ ἡ ἀδελφή μου πρός με, καὶ κολλυρισάτω
ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς μου δύο κολλυρίδας, καὶ φάγομαι ἐκ τῆς χειρὸς

### Chapter 12

**27** Rabbath of the children of Ammon, and he took the royal city.
And Joab sent messengers unto David, and said, I have fought
**28** against Rabbath, and I have taken the city of the waters.
Now therefore gather thou the rest of the people,
and encamp against the city, and take it,
lest I take the city myself,
**29** and my name be called upon it.
And David gathered all the people, and went to Rabbath,
and fought against it,
**30** and took it.
And he took the crown of their king from off his head,
and the weight thereof was a talent of gold,
and a precious stone: and it was upon David’s head;
**31** and the spoil of the city did he bring forth exceeding much.
And the people that were therein he brought forth,
and put them under saws, and under iron harrows,
and made them pass through the brickkiln.
And thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon.
And David returned, and all the people, unto Jerusalem.

### Chapter 13

**1** And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David
had a sister very beautiful to look upon,
whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.
**2** And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar;
for she was a virgin; and it was a great obstacle, (yea,)
and in Amnon’s eyes, what he might do unto her.
**3** But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab,
the son of Shimeah, David’s brother:
and Jonadab was a very wise man.
**4** And he said unto him, Why art thou, O son of the king,
thus lean from morning to morning?
wilt thou not tell me?
And Amnon said unto him, Tamar,
**5** my brother Absalom’s sister, I love.
And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed,
and feign thyself sick; and when thy father cometh to see thee,
thou shalt say unto him, [I pray thee,] let Tamar my sister come,
and give me food, and make meat in my sight,
that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.
**6** So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick:
and when the king was come to see him,
Amnon said unto the king, [I pray thee,] let Tamar my sister come unto me,
and make me two cakes in my sight, that I may eat them at her hand.
