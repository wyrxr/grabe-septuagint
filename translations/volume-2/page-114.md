6 χειμάρροι ἀνομίας ἐθάμβησάν με. Ὠδῖνες θανάτου ἐκύκλωσάν με,
7 προέφθασάν με σκληρότητες θανάτου. Ἐν τῷ θλίβεσθαί με ἐπικα-
   λέσομαι Κύριον, καὶ πρὸς τὸν Θεόν μου βοηθήσομαι, καὶ ἐπακού-
   σεται ἐκ ναοῦ αὐτοῦ φωνῆς μου, καὶ ἡ κραυγή μου ἐν τοῖς ὠσὶν
8 αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐταράχθη καὶ ἐσείσθη ἡ γῆ, καὶ τὰ θεμέλια τοῦ οὐ-
   ρανοῦ ἐταράχθησαν καὶ ἐσπαράχθησαν, ὅτι ἐθυμώθη Κύριος αὐ-
9 τοῖς. Ἀνέβη καπνὸς ἐν τῇ ὀργῇ αὐτοῦ, καὶ πῦρ ἐκ στόματος αὐ-
10 τοῦ κατέδεται· ἄνθρακες ἐξεκαύθησαν ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἔκλινεν οὐ-
11 ρανούς, καὶ κατέβη, καὶ γνόφος ὑποκάτω τῶν ποδῶν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ
   ἐκάθισε ἐπὶ Χερουβείμ, καὶ ἐπετάσθη, καὶ ὤφθη ἐπὶ πτερύγων
12 ἀνέμου. Καὶ ἔθετο σκότος ἀποκρυφὴν αὐτοῦ· κύκλῳ αὐτοῦ ἡ
13 σκηνὴ αὐτοῦ σκότος ὑδάτων, ἐπάχυνεν ἐν νεφέλαις ἀέρων. Ἀπὸ
14 τοῦ φέγγους ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ ἐξεκαύθησαν ἄνθρακες πυρός. Ἔβρόν-
15 τησε μὲν ἐξ οὐρανοῦ Κύριος, καὶ ὁ ὕψιστος ἔδωκε φωνὴν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ
   ἀπέστειλε βέλη, καὶ ἐσκόρπισεν αὐτούς· ἀστραπήν, καὶ ἐξέστη-
16 σεν αὐτούς. Καὶ ὤφθησαν ἀρέσεις θαλάσσης, καὶ ἀπεκαλύφθη
   θεμέλια τῆς οἰκουμένης ἐν τῇ ἐπιτιμήσει Κυρίου, ἀπὸ πνοῆς πνεύ-
17 ματος θυμοῦ αὐτοῦ. Ἀπέστειλεν ἐξ ὕψους καὶ ἀνέλαβέ με, εἵλ-
18 κυσε μέ ἐξ ὑδάτων πολλῶν· ἐῤῥύσατό με ἐξ ἐχθρῶν μου ἰσχυρός,
19 ἐκ τῶν μισούντων με, ὅτι ἐκραταιώθησαν ὑπὲρ ἐμέ. Προέφθασάν
20 με ἡμέραι θλίψεώς μου· καὶ ἐγένετο Κύριος ἐπιστήριγμά μου, καὶ
   ἐξήγαγέ με εἰς πλατυσμόν, καὶ ἐξείλατό με, ὅτι εὐδόκησεν ἐν ἐ-
21 μοί. Καὶ ἀνταπέδωκέ μοι Κύριος κατὰ τὴν δικαιοσύνην μου, καὶ
22 κατὰ τὴν καθαριότητα τῶν χειρῶν μου ἀνταπέδωκέ μοι. Ὅτι ἐ-
23 φύλαξα **ὁδοὺς** Κυρίου, καὶ οὐκ ἠσέβησα ἀπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ μου. Ὅτι
   πάντα τὰ κρίματα αὐτοῦ, κατεναντίον μου, καὶ τὰ δικαιώματα
24 αὐτοῦ, οὐκ ἀπέστην ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἔσομαι ἄμωμος αὐτῷ, καὶ
25 προφυλάξομαι ἀπὸ τῆς ἀνομίας μου. Καὶ ἀποδώσει μοι Κύριος
   κατὰ τὴν δικαιοσύνην μου, καὶ κατὰ τὴν καθαριότητα τῶν χειρῶν
26 μου ἐναντίον τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν αὐτοῦ. Μετὰ ὁσίου ὁσιωθήσῃ, καὶ
27 μετὰ ἀνδρὸς τελείου τελειωθήσῃ. Καὶ μετὰ ἐκλεκτοῦ ἐκλεκτὸς ἔσῃ,
28 καὶ μετὰ στρεβλοῦ διαστρέψεις. Καὶ τὸν λαὸν τὸν πτωχὸν σώ-
29 σεις, καὶ ὀφθαλμοὺς ἐπὶ μετεώρων ταπεινώσεις· ὅτι σὺ ὁ λύχνος
30 μου, Κύριε, καὶ Κύριος (μου) ἐκλάμπει μοι τὸ σκότος μου· ὅτι ἐν
   σοὶ δραμοῦμαι μονόζωνος, καὶ ἐν τῷ Θεῷ μου ὑπερβήσομαι τεί-
31 χος. Ὁ ἰσχυρός, ἄμωμος ἡ ὁδὸς αὐτοῦ· τὸ ῥῆμα Κυρίου **πεπυριωμένον**.

**CHAPTER 22**

**6** The torrents of lawlessness dismayed me.
**7** The pangs of death encompassed me; the cruelties of death overtook me. In my distress will I call upon the Lord, and unto my God will I cry for help; and He shall hear my voice out of His temple, and my cry shall come into His ears.

**8** Then the earth shook and quaked, and the foundations of the heavens were disturbed and rent asunder, because the Lord was wroth with them.
**9** There went up a smoke in His wrath, and fire from His mouth devoured; coals were kindled by it.
**10** And He bowed the heavens, and came down; and thick darkness was beneath His feet.
**11** And He sat upon the Cherubim, and He did fly; and He was seen upon the wings of the wind.
**12** And He made darkness His secret place; round about Him His tabernacle was the darkness of waters, He made them dense with the clouds of the skies.
**13** From the brightness before Him were coals of fire kindled.
**14** The Lord thundered from heaven, and the Most High uttered forth His voice.
**15** And He sent forth arrows, and scattered them; [He sent forth] lightning, and discomfited them.
**16** Then the channels of the sea were seen, and the foundations of the world were uncovered at the rebuke of the Lord, at the blast of the breath of His wrath.

**17** He sent from above and took me; He drew me out of many waters.
**18** He delivered me from my strong enemies,
**19** from those who hated me, for they were mighty beyond me. They overtook me in the day of my affliction; but the Lord was my stay.
**20** And He brought me forth into a spacious place; and He delivered me, because He delighted in me.
**21** And the Lord recompensed me according to my righteousness; and according to the cleanness of my hands did He recompense me.
**22** For I have kept the ways of the Lord, and have not wickedly departed from my God.
**23** For all His judgments were before me, and His statutes; I did not depart from them.
**24** And I shall be blameless before Him, and I shall keep myself from mine iniquity.
**25** And the Lord will recompense me according to my righteousness, and according to the cleanness of my hands in His eyesight.

**26** With the holy shalt Thou be holy, and with the perfect man shalt Thou be perfect.
**27** And with the elect shalt Thou be elect, and with the froward shalt Thou deal frowardly.
**28** And the poor people shalt Thou save, but the eyes of the haughty shalt Thou humble.
**29** For Thou art my lamp, O Lord; and the Lord [my Lord] doth lighten my darkness for me.
**30** For in Thee will I run, being girt [for battle], and in my God will I leap over a wall.
**31** God is mighty, His way is blameless; the word of the Lord is purified by fire.
