**Original Greek Text (with light OCR corrections):**

**8** Ἰωᾶς, υἱὸν Ἰωάχαζ υἱοῦ Ἰηοῦ βασιλέως Ἰσραήλ, λέγων· δεῦρο
**9** ὀρθῶμεν προσώποις. Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ἰωᾶς βασιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς
Ἀμασίαν βασιλέα Ἰούδα, λέγων· ὁ ἄκαν ἐν τῷ Λιβάνῳ ἀπέ-
στειλε πρὸς τὴν κέδρον τὴν ἐν τῷ Λιβάνῳ, λέγων· δὸς τὴν θυγα-
τέρα σου τῷ υἱῷ μου εἰς γυναῖκα, καὶ διῆλθε τὰ θηρία τοῦ ἀγροῦ τὰ
**10** ἐν τῷ Λιβάνῳ, καὶ συνεπάτησαν τὸν ἄκανα. Τύπτων ἐπάταξας
τὴν Ἰδουμαίαν, καὶ ἐπῆρέ σε ἡ καρδία σου, ἐνδοξάσθητι καθήμε-
νος ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ σου, καὶ ἵνα τί ἐρίζεις ἐν κακίᾳ σου; καὶ πεσῇ σὺ,
**11** καὶ Ἰούδας μετὰ σοῦ. Καὶ οὐκ ἤκουσεν Ἀμεσίας. Καὶ ἀνέβη Ἰωᾶς
βασιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ ὤφθησαν προσώποις, αὐτὸς καὶ Ἀμασίας
**12** βασιλεὺς Ἰούδα ἐν Βηθσαμὺς τῇ τῆς Ἰουδαίας. Καὶ ἔπταισεν Ἰού-
δας ἀπὸ προσώπου Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ ἔφυγεν ἀνὴρ εἰς τὸ σκήνωμα αὐ-
**13** τοῦ. Καὶ τὸν Ἀμεσσίαν βασιλέα Ἰούδα υἱὸν Ἰωᾶς υἱοῦ Ὀχοζίου
ἔλαβεν Ἰωᾶς υἱὸς Ἰωάχαζ βασιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ ἐν Βηθσαμύς. Καὶ
ἦλθεν εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ, καὶ διέκοψεν ἐν τείχει Ἱερουσαλὴμ, ἐν τῇ
**14** πύλῃ Ἐφραΐμ, ἕως τῆς πύλης τῶν γωνιῶν, τετρακοσίους πήχεις.
Καὶ ἔλαβε τὸ χρυσίον, καὶ τὸ ἀργύριον, καὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη τὰ
εὑρεθέντα ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου, καὶ ἐν θησαυροῖς οἴκου τοῦ βασιλέως,
καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς τῶν συμμίζεων, καὶ ἀπέστρεψεν εἰς Σαμάρειαν.
**15** Καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Ἰωᾶς, ὅσα ἐποίησεν ἐν δυναστείᾳ αὐ-
τοῦ, ἃ ἐπολέμησε μετὰ Ἀμεσσίου βασιλέως Ἰούδα, οὐκ ἰδοὺ ταῦτα
γεγραμμένα ἐν βιβλίῳ λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν Ἰσραήλ;
**16** Καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Ἰωᾶς μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐτάφη ἐν Σα-
μαρείᾳ μετὰ τῶν βασιλέων Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Ἱεροβοὰμ
**17** υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἔζησεν Ἀμεσίας υἱὸς Ἰωᾶς βασιλεὺς
Ἰούδα μετὰ τὸ ἀποθανεῖν Ἰωᾶς υἱὸν Ἰωάχαζ βασιλέα Ἰσραήλ,
**18** πεντεκαίδεκα ἔτη. Καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Ἀμεσίου, καὶ πάντα
ὅσα ἐποίησεν, οὐχὶ ταῦτα γεγραμμένα ἐπὶ βιβλίῳ λόγων τῶν ἡμε-
**19** ρῶν τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν Ἰούδα; Καὶ συνεστράφησαν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν σύ-
στρεμμα ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ, καὶ ἔφυγεν εἰς Λαχείς, καὶ ἀπέστειλαν
**20** ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ εἰς Λαχεὶς, καὶ ἐθανάτωσαν αὐτὸν ἐκεῖ. Καὶ ἦραν
αὐτὸν ἐφ᾿ ἵππων, καὶ ἐτάφη ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ μετὰ τῶν πατέρων
**21** αὐτοῦ ἐν πόλει Δαυΐδ. Καὶ ἔλαβε πᾶς ὁ λαὸς Ἰούδα τὸν Ἀζα-
ρίαν, καὶ αὐτὸς υἱὸς ἕξ καὶ δέκα ἐτῶν, καὶ ἐβασίλευσαν αὐτὸν
**22** ἀντὶ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ Ἀμεσσίου. Αὐτὸς ᾠκοδόμησε τὴν Αἰλὼθ,
καὶ ἀπέστρεψεν αὐτὴν τῷ Ἰούδα μετὰ τὸ κοιμηθῆναι τὸν βασιλέα

**Literary Translation:**

**8** Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, "Come,
**9** let us look one another in the face." Then Joash, the king of Israel, sent unto Amaziah, king of Judah, saying, "The thistle that was in Lebanon sent unto the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, 'Give thy daughter unto my son to wife.' But there passed by the beasts of the field that were
**10** in Lebanon, and they trampled the thistle. Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thy heart hath lifted thee up [in pride]. Take glory, [and] abide in thine own house. And wherefore shouldest thou contend to thine own hurt, that thou shouldest fall, both thou,
**11** and Judah with thee?" But Amaziah would not hearken. So Joash, the king of Israel, went up; and he and Amaziah,
**12** the king of Judah, met face to face at Bethshemesh, that [city] of Judah. And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and every man fled unto his tent.
**13** And Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the king of Israel, took Amaziah, king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Ahaziah, at Bethshemesh. And he came unto Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem, from
**14** the gate of Ephraim even unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits [of length]. And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house, and the sons of the mingled ones, and returned to Samaria.
**15** Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did in his might, and how he warred with Amaziah, the king of Judah, are they not behold, written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
**16** And Joash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. And Jeroboam,
**17** his son, reigned in his stead. And Amaziah, the son of Joash, the king of Judah, lived after the death of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the king of Israel,
**18** for fifteen years. And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the
**19** Kings of Judah? Now a conspiracy was formed against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish. But they sent
**20** after him to Lachish, and slew him there. And they bore him upon horses, and he was buried in Jerusalem with his fathers,
**21** in the city of David. And all the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king
**22** instead of his father Amaziah. He it was who built Elath, and restored it to Judah after that the king was fallen asleep [with his fathers].
