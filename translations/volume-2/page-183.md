ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Δʹ

ΚΕΦΑΛΑΙΟΝ Α΄.

1. ΚΑΙ ἠθέτησε Μωὰβ ἐν Ἰσραὴλ μετὰ τὸ ἀποθανεῖν Ἀχαάβ.
2. Καὶ ἔπεσεν Ὀχοζίας διὰ τοῦ δικτυωτοῦ τοῦ ἐν τῷ ὑπερῴῳ αὐτοῦ τῷ ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ, καὶ ἠῤῥώστησε· καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ἀγγέλους, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτούς· δεῦτε καὶ ἐπερωτήσατε ἐν τῇ Βάαλ μυῖαν, θεὸν Ἀκκαρών, εἰ ζήσομαι ἐκ τῆς ἀῤῥωστίας μου ταύτης.
3. Καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν ἐπερωτῆσαι δι᾽ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἄγγελος Κυρίου ἐκάλεσεν Ἠλιοὺ τὸν Θεσβίτην, λέγων· ἀνάστηθι, καὶ πορεύθητι εἰς συνάντησιν τῶν ἀγγέλων Ὀχοζίου βασιλέως Σαμαρείας, καὶ λαλήσεις πρὸς αὐτούς· εἰ παρὰ τὸ μὴ εἶναι Θεὸν ἐν Ἰσραὴλ, ὑμεῖς πορεύεσθε ἐπιζητῆσαι ἐν τῷ Βάαλ μυῖαν, θεὸν Ἀκκαρών;
4. καὶ οὐχ οὕτως. Ὅτι τάδε λέγει Κύριος· ἡ κλίνη (σου) ἐφ᾿ ἧς ἀνέβης ἐκεῖ, οὐ καταβήσῃ ἀπ᾿ αὐτῆς, ὅτι (ἐκεῖ) θανάτῳ ἀποθανῇ. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη Ἠλιοὺ, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτούς·
5. καὶ ἐπεστράφησαν οἱ ἄγγελοι πρὸς αὐτόν· καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτούς· τί ὅτι ἐπεστράφητε;
6. Καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς αὐτόν· ἀνὴρ ἀνέβη εἰς συνάντησιν ἡμῶν, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς ἡμᾶς· δεῦτε ἐπιστράφητε πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα τὸν ἀποστείλαντα ὑμᾶς, καὶ λαλήσατε πρὸς αὐτόν· τάδε λέγει Κύριος· εἰ παρὰ τὸ μὴ εἶναι Θεὸν ἐν Ἰσραὴλ, σὺ πορεύῃ ζητῆσαι ἐν τῇ Βάαλ μυῖαν, θεὸν Ἀκκαρών; οὐχ οὕτως. ἡ κλίνη ἐφ᾿ ἧς ἀνέβης ἐκεῖ, οὐ καταβήσῃ ἀπ᾿ αὐτῆς, ὅτι θανάτῳ ἀποθανῇ.
7. Καὶ ἐλάλησε πρὸς αὐτούς· τίς ἡ κρίσις τοῦ ἀνδρὸς τοῦ ἀναβάντος εἰς συνάντησιν ὑμῖν, καὶ λαλήσαντος πρὸς ὑμᾶς τοὺς λόγους τούτους;
8. Καὶ εἶπον πρὸς αὐτόν· ἀνὴρ δασὺς, καὶ ζώνην δερματίνην περιεζωσμένος τὴν ὀσφῦν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπεν· Ἠλιοὺ ὁ Θεσβίτης ἐστὶν οὗτος.
9. Καὶ ἀπέστειλε πρὸς αὐτὸν (ἡγούμενον) πεντηκόνταρχον καὶ τοὺς πεντήκοντα αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἀνέβη, καὶ ἦλθε πρὸς αὐτόν. Καὶ ἰδοὺ Ἠλιοὺ ἐκάθητο ἐπὶ τῆς κορυφῆς τοῦ ὄρους· καὶ ἐλάλησεν ὁ πεντηκόνταρχος πρὸς

**CHAPTER 1.**

**1** And Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
**2** And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber which was in Samaria, and he became sick. And he sent messengers, and said unto them, "Go, and inquire of Baal-fly, the god of Ekron, if I shall recover from this my sickness."
**3** And they departed to inquire by him. And an angel of the Lord called Elijah the Tishbite, saying, "Arise, and go to meet the messengers of Ahaziah, king of Samaria; and thou shalt speak unto them, [saying], 'Is it because there is no God in Israel, that ye go to seek of Baal-fly, the god of Ekron?'"
**4** "And it is not so. For thus saith the Lord: The bed [of thine] upon which thou art gone up there, thou shalt not come down from it, for [there] thou shalt surely die." So Elijah went, and spake unto them.
