ἐπὶ τῶν ἔργων, καὶ ἐπ᾿ αὐτῶν ἐπίσκοποι Ἰὲθ καὶ Ἀβδίας οἱ Λευῖται ἐξ υἱῶν Μεραρί, καὶ Ζαχαρίας καὶ Μοσολλὰμ ἐκ τῶν υἱῶν Καὰθ ἐπισκοπεῖν, καὶ πᾶς Λευίτης συνιὼν ἐν ὀργάνοις ᾠδῶν. 13 Καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν νωτοφόρων, καὶ ἐπὶ πάντων τῶν ποιοῦντων τὰ ἔργα, ἐργασία καὶ ἐργασία· καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν Λευιτῶν γραμματεῖς, καὶ κριταί, καὶ πυλωροί. 14 Καὶ ἐν τῷ ἐκφέρειν αὐτοὺς τὸ ἀργύριον τὸ εἰσοδιασθὲν εἰς οἶκον Κυρίου, εὗρε Χελκίας ὁ ἱερεὺς βιβλίον νόμου Κυρίου διὰ χειρὸς Μωϋσῆ. 15 Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Χελκίας, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς Σαφὰν τὸν γραμματέα· βιβλίον νόμου εὗρον ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου· καὶ ἔδωκε Χελκίας τὸ βιβλίον τῷ Σαφάν. 16 Καὶ εἰσήνεγκε Σαφὰν τὸ βιβλίον πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα, καὶ ἀπέδωκεν ἔτι τῷ βασιλεῖ λόγον, πᾶν τὸ δοθὲν ἀργύριον ἐν χειρὶ τῶν παίδων σου τῶν ποιοῦντων τὸ ἔργον. 17 Καὶ ἐχώνευσαν τὸ ἀργύριον τὸ εὑρεθὲν ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου, καὶ ἔδωκαν ἐπὶ χεῖρα τῶν ἐπισκόπων, καὶ ἐπὶ χεῖρα τῶν ποιοῦντων τὴν ἐργασίαν. 18 Καὶ ἀπήγγειλε Σαφὰν ὁ γραμματεὺς τῷ βασιλεῖ, λέγων· βιβλίον νόμου ἔδωκέ μοι Χελκίας ὁ ἱερεύς· καὶ ἀνέγνω αὐτὸ Σαφὰν ἐναντίον τοῦ βασιλέως. 19 Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἤκουσεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τοὺς λόγους τοῦ νόμου, καὶ διέρρηξε τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ· 20 καὶ ἐνετείλατο ὁ βασιλεὺς τῷ Χελκία, καὶ τῷ Ἀχικάμ, υἱῷ Σαφάν, καὶ τῷ Ἀβδὼν υἱῷ Μιχαία, καὶ τῷ Σαφὰν τῷ γραμματεῖ, καὶ τῷ Ἀσαΐᾳ παιδὶ τοῦ βασιλέως λέγων· 21 πορευθῆτε ζητήσατε τὸν Κύριον περὶ ἐμοῦ, καὶ περὶ παντὸς τοῦ καταλειφθέντος ἐν Ἰσραὴλ καὶ ἐν Ἰούδα περὶ τῶν λόγων τοῦ βιβλίου τοῦ εὑρεθέντος, ὅτι μέγας ὁ θυμὸς Κυρίου ἐκκέκαυται ἐν ἡμῖν, διότι οὐκ εἰσήκουσαν οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν τῶν λόγων Κυρίου, τοῦ ποιῆσαι κατὰ πάντα τὰ γεγραμμένα ἐν τῷ βιβλίῳ τούτῳ. 22 Καὶ ἐπορεύθη Χελκίας, καὶ οἷς εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς πρὸς Ὄλδαν τὴν προφῆτιν γυναῖκα Σελλὴμ υἱοῦ Θακουὰθ υἱοῦ Ἐσσερί, φυλάσσουσαν τὰς ἐντολάς, καὶ αὕτη κατῴκει ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐν Μεσαναι, καὶ ἐλάλησαν αὐτῇ κατὰ ταῦτα· 23 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ· εἴπατε τῷ ἀνδρὶ τῷ ἀποστείλαντι ὑμᾶς πρὸς μέ· 24 οὕτως λέγει Κύριος· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐπάγω κακὰ ἐπὶ τὸν τόπον τοῦτον, τοὺς πάντας λόγους τοὺς γεγραμμένους ἐν τῷ βιβλίῳ τῷ ἀνεγνωσμένῳ ἐναντίον τοῦ βασιλέως Ἰούδα, 25 ἀνθ᾿ ὧν ἐγκατέλιπόν με καὶ ἔθυσαν θεοῖς ἑτέροις, ἵνα παροργίσωσί με ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς ἔργοις τῶν χειρῶν ἑαυτῶν. Καὶ ἐξεκάθη ὁ θυμός μου ἐν τῷ τόπῳ τούτῳ, καὶ οὐ σβεσθήσεται.

**Chapter 44 [sic] of the Books of Judah II**

¹² Now over the works, and over them as overseers, were Jahath and Obadiah, Levites of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of Kohath, to oversee; and every Levite who was skilled in instruments of song.
¹³ And over the burden-bearers, and over all that wrought the work, task upon task [were they set]; and from among the Levites were scribes, and judges, and doorkeepers.

¹⁴ And it came to pass, as they brought forth the silver which had been brought into the House of the LORD, that Hilkiah the priest found a book of the Law of the LORD by the hand of Moses.
¹⁵ Then Hilkiah answered, and said unto Shaphan the scribe, "A book of the Law have I found in the House of the LORD." And Hilkiah delivered the book unto Shaphan.
¹⁶ And Shaphan brought the book unto the king, and moreover rendered an account unto the king, [saying], "All the silver that was delivered into the hand of thy servants, who do the work."
¹⁷ And they purified the silver that was found in the House of the LORD, and delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and into the hand of them that wrought the work.
¹⁸ And Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, "Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book of the Law." And Shaphan read it before the king.
¹⁹ And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the Law, that he rent his clothes.
²⁰ And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah, a servant of the king, saying,
²¹ "Go you, inquire of the LORD for me, and for all that is left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book which is found. For great is the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of the LORD, to do according to all that is written in this book."
²² So Hilkiah, and those to whom the king had spoken, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, who kept the commandments; and she dwelt in Jerusalem in Mesanai. And they spake unto her according to these words.
²³ And she said unto them, "Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: Tell you the man that sent you unto me,
²⁴ 'Thus saith the LORD: Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, even all the words that are written in the book which was read before the king of Judah,
²⁵ because they have forsaken Me, and have offered sacrifices unto other gods, that they might provoke Me to wrath with all the works of their hands. And My wrath is poured out upon this place, and it shall not be quenched.'"
