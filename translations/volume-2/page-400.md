ΚΕΦ. Β΄. ΕΣΘΗΡ. 876
19 Ἐσθὴρ, καὶ ἄφεσιν ἐποίησε τοῖς ὑπὸ τὴν βασιλείαν αὐτοῦ. Ὁ δὲ
20 Μαρδοχαῖος ἐθεράπευσεν ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ. Ἡ δὲ Ἐσθὴρ οὐχ ὑπέδειξε
   τὴν πατρίδα αὐτῆς· οὕτως γὰρ ἐνετείλατο αὐτῇ ὁ Μαρδοχαῖος,
   φοβεῖσθαι τὸν Θεὸν, καὶ ποιεῖν τὰ προστάγματα αὐτοῦ, καθὼς ἦν
21 μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ Ἐσθὴρ οὐκ ἤλλαξε τὴν ἀγωγὴν αὐτῆς. Καὶ ἐλυ-
   πήθησαν οἱ δύο εὐνοῦχοι τοῦ βασιλέως οἱ ἀρχισωματοφύλακες, ὅτι
   προήχθη ὁ Μαρδοχαῖος, καὶ ἐζήτουν ἀποκτεῖναι Ἀρταξέρξην τὸν
22 βασιλέα. Καὶ ἐδηλώθη Μαρδοχαίῳ ὁ λόγος, καὶ ἐσήμανεν Ἐσθὴρ
   τῇ βασιλίσσῃ, καὶ ἡ βασίλισσα ἐνεφάνισε τῷ βασιλεῖ Ἀρταξέρξῃ
23 τὰ τῆς ἐπιβουλῆς. Ὁ δὲ βασιλεὺς ἤτασε τοὺς δύο εὐνούχους, καὶ
   ἐκρέμασεν αὐτούς· καὶ προσέταξεν ὁ βασιλεὺς καταχωρίσαι εἰς
   μνημόσυνον ἐν τῇ βασιλικῇ βιβλιοθήκῃ, ὑπὲρ τῆς εὐνοίας Μαρδο-
   χαίου ἐν ἐγκωμίῳ.

1  ΜΕΤΑ τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα ἐδόξασεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἀρταξέρξης
   Ἀμὰν Ἀμαδαθοῦ Βουγαῖον, καὶ ὕψωσεν αὐτὸν, καὶ ἐπρωτοβάθρει
2  πάντων τῶν φίλων αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντες οἱ ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ προσεκύνουν
   Ἀμάν· οὕτως γὰρ ἐπέταξεν ὁ βασιλεὺς ποιῆσαι. Ὁ δὲ Μαρδοχαῖος
3  οὐ προσεκύνει αὐτῷ. Καὶ ἐλάλησαν οἱ ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ τοῦ βασιλέως
   τῷ Μαρδοχαίῳ· Μαρδοχαῖε, τί παρακούεις τὰ ὑπὸ τοῦ βασιλέως
4  λεγόμενα; Καθ᾿ ἑκάστην ἡμέραν ἔλεγον αὐτῷ, καὶ οὐχ ὑπήκουσεν
   αὐτῶν. Καὶ ὑπέδειξαν τῷ Ἀμάν, Μαρδοχαῖον μὴ ὑπακούοντα τοῖς
   τοῦ βασιλέως λόγοις, ὑπέδειξε γὰρ αὐτοῖς ὁ Μαρδοχαῖος, ὅτι Ἰου-
5  δαῖός ἐστι. Καὶ ἐπέγνω Ἀμὰν ἔτι οὐ προσκυνεῖ αὐτῷ Μαρδο-
6  χαῖος, καὶ ἐθυμώθη Ἀμὰν σφόδρα. Καὶ ἐβουλεύσατο ἀφανίσαι
7  πάντας τοὺς ὑπὸ τὴν Ἀρταξέρξου βασιλείαν Ἰουδαίους. Ἐν ἔτει
   δωδεκάτῳ βασιλεύοντος Ἀρταξέρξου, ψήφισμα ἐποίησε, καὶ ἔβα-
   λε κλήρους ἡμέραν ἐξ ἡμέρας, καὶ μῆνα ἐκ μηνὸς, ὥστε ἀπολέσαι
   ἐν μιᾷ ἡμέρᾳ τὸ γένος Μαρδοχαίου· καὶ ἔπεσεν ὁ κλῆρος εἰς τὴν
8  τεσσαρεσκαιδεκάτην τοῦ μηνὸς ὃς ἐστιν Ἀδάρ. Καὶ ἐλάλησε πρὸς
   τὸν βασιλέα Ἀρταξέρξην, λέγων· ὑπάρχει ἔθνος διεσπαρμένον ἐν
   τοῖς ἔθνεσιν ἐν πάσῃ τῇ βασιλείᾳ σου, οἱ δὲ νόμοι αὐτῶν ἔξαλλοι
   παρὰ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη, τῶν δὲ νόμων τοῦ βασιλέως παρακούουσι,
9  ⊕ καὶ τῷ βασιλεῖ οὐ συμφέρει ἐᾶσαι αὐτούς. Εἰ δοκεῖ οὖν τῷ βα

#### CHAPTER II

<sup>19</sup> Esther, and made a remission unto all those under his dominion.
<sup>20</sup> But Mordechai attended within the royal court. Now Esther had not made known her lineage, nor her country; for thus had Mordechai charged her, that she should fear God, and keep His commandments, even as he was with her. And Esther did not alter her [righteous] conduct.
<sup>21</sup> Now the two eunuchs of the king, who were the chief chamberlains, were filled with vexation, for that Mordechai had been advanced; and they sought to slay Artaxerxes the king.
<sup>22</sup> And the matter was made known unto Mordechai; and he did signify it unto Esther the queen, and the queen then revealed unto King Artaxerxes the devices of the conspiracy.
<sup>23</sup> Then the king examined the two eunuchs, and he caused them to be hanged. And the king commanded that the account be inscribed for a memorial in the royal library, concerning the faithfulness of Mordechai, [recorded] in an encomium.

#### CHAPTER III

<sup>1</sup> After these words, King Artaxerxes did exalt Haman, the son of Hamadatha the Bugaean, and did promote him, and set his seat above all his friends.
<sup>2</sup> And all the king's servants who were in the court did bow down and perform obeisance to Haman; for so had the king commanded them to do. But Mordechai did not bow down, nor did he perform obeisance.
<sup>3</sup> Then the king's servants, who were in the court, spoke unto Mordechai, saying, "Mordechai, why dost thou transgress the king's commandment?"
<sup>4</sup> Now when they spoke daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, then they made known unto Haman that Mordechai obeyed not the king's words; for Mordechai had declared unto them that he was a Jew.
<sup>5</sup> And when Haman perceived that Mordechai still did not bow down before him, then was Haman filled with exceeding wrath.
<sup>6</sup> And he took counsel to destroy all the Jews throughout the whole kingdom of Artaxerxes.
<sup>7</sup> In the twelfth year of King Artaxerxes' reign, he caused a decree to be made, and did cast lots, [from] day to day, and [from] month to month, so that he might destroy in one day the kindred of Mordechai; and the lot fell upon the fourteenth day of the month, which is Adar.
<sup>8</sup> And Haman said unto King Artaxerxes, "There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from [those of] all other peoples, and they keep not the king's laws;
<sup>9</sup> wherefore it is not for the king's profit to suffer them. If it therefore please the king, let it be decreed that they be utterly destroyed,"
