506 ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Α΄. ΚΕΦ. ΙΔ΄.
ἐπεσκέψαντο, καὶ ἰδοὺ οὐχ εὑρίσκεται Ἰωνάθαν καὶ ὁ αἴρων τὰ σκεύη
18 αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπε Σαοὺλ τῷ Ἀχιᾷ· προσάγαγε τὸ Ἐφούδ, ὅτι ἦν
19 ἡ κιβωτὸς τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἐνώπιον Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ
    ἐγενήθη ὡς ἐλάλει Σαοὺλ πρὸς τὸν ἱερέα, καὶ ὁ ἦχος ἐν τῇ πα-
    ρεμβολῇ τῶν ἀλλοφύλων ἐπορεύετο πορευόμενος καὶ ἐπλήθυνε. Καὶ
20 εἶπε Σαοὺλ πρὸς τὸν ἱερέα· συνάγαγε τὰς χεῖράς σου. Καὶ ἀνε-
    βόησε Σαοὺλ καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ὁ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔρχονται ἕως τοῦ
    πολέμου. Καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐγένετο ῥομφαία ἀνδρὸς ἐπὶ τὸν πλησίον αὐ-
21 τοῦ, σύγχυσις μεγάλη σφόδρα. Καὶ οἱ δοῦλοι οἱ ὄντες μετὰ τῶν
    ἀλλοφύλων ἐχθὲς καὶ τρίτην ἡμέραν, οἱ ἀναβαίνοντες εἰς τὴν πα-
    ρεμβολήν, ἐπεστράφησαν καὶ αὐτοὶ εἶναι μετὰ Ἰσραὴλ τῶν μετὰ
22 Σαοὺλ καὶ Ἰωνάθαν. Καὶ πᾶς ἀνὴρ Ἰσραὴλ οἱ κρυπτόμενοι ἐν τῷ ὄρει
    Ἐφραίμ, καὶ ἤκουσαν ὅτι πεφεύγασιν οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι· καὶ συνάπτ
23 καὶ αὐτοὶ ὀπίσω αὐτῶν εἰς πόλεμον. Καὶ ἔσωσε Κύριος ἐν τῇ
    ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ τὸν Ἰσραήλ· καὶ ὁ πόλεμος διῆλθε τὴν Βηθὰν
    καὶ πᾶς δ᾽ ὁ λαὸς ἦν μετὰ Σαοὺλ ὡς δέκα χιλιάδες ἀνδρῶν, καὶ
    ἦν ὁ πόλεμος διεσπαρμένος εἰς ὅλην τὴν πόλιν ἐν τῷ ὄρει Ἐφ-
24 ραίμ. Καὶ Σαοὺλ ἠγνόησεν ἄγνοιαν μεγάλην ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ,
    καὶ ἀρᾶται τῷ λαῷ, λέγων· ἐπικατάρατος ὁ ἄνθρωπος ὃς φάγεται
    ἄρτον ἕως ἑσπέρας καὶ ἐκδικήσω τὸν ἐχθρόν μου· καὶ οὐκ ἐγεύσατο
25 πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ἄρτου· Καὶ πᾶσα ἡ γῆ ἠρίστα. Καὶ Γὰρ δρυμὸς ἦν
26 μελισσῶνος κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ ἀγροῦ· καὶ εἰσῆλθεν ὁ λαὸς εἰς
    τὸν μελισσῶνα, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐπορεύετο λαλῶν· καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἐπιστρέφων
    τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ, ὅτι ἐφοβήθη ὁ λαὸς τὸν
27 ὅρκον Κυρίου. Καὶ Ἰωνάθαν οὐκ ἀκήκοει ἐν τῷ ὁρκίζειν τὸν πα-
    τέρα αὐτοῦ τὸν λαόν· καὶ ἐξέτεινε τὸ ἄκρον τοῦ σκήπτρου αὐτοῦ
    τοῦ ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἔβαψεν αὐτὸ εἰς τὸ κηρίον τοῦ μέλι-
    τος, καὶ ἐπέστρεψε τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ, καὶ
28 ἀνέβλεψαν οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη εἷς ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ,
    καὶ εἶπεν· ὀρκίσας ὤρκισεν ὁ πατήρ σου τὸν λαόν, λέγων· ἐπικα-
    τάρατος ὁ ἄνθρωπος ὃς φάγεται ἄρτον σήμερον, καὶ ἐξελύθη ὁ
29 λαός. Καὶ ἔγνω Ἰωνάθαν, καὶ εἶπεν· ἀπήλλαχεν ὁ πατήρ μου
    τὴν γῆν· ἴδε, διότι ἴδον οἱ ὀφθαλμοί μου ὅτι ἐγευσάμην βραχὺ
30 τοῦ μέλιτος τούτου, ἀλλ᾿ ὅτι ἔφαγεν ἔσθων σήμερον ὁ λαὸς τῶν
    σκύλων τῶν ἐχθρῶν αὐτῶν ὧν εὗρεν, ἔτι νῦν ἂν μείζων ἦν ἡ πληγὴ
31 ἐν τοῖς ἀλλοφύλοις. Καὶ ἐπάταξεν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἐκ τῶν

17 ...they searched, and behold, Jonathan was not found, nor he that bore his armor.
18 And Saul said unto Ahiah, "Bring near the Ephod." For the Ark of God was in that day before Israel.
19 And it came to pass, while Saul spake unto the priest, that the clamor in the camp of the Philistines went forth, going and increasing.
20 And Saul said unto the priest, "Draw back thine hands." And Saul and all the people that were with him cried out, and they came even unto the battle. And behold, there was a sword of a man upon his neighbor, a very great confusion.
21 And the servants who had been with the Philistines yesterday and the day before yesterday, those who came up into the camp, they also turned to be with Israel, even with those who were with Saul and Jonathan.
22 And every man of Israel who had hidden themselves in the Mount of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines had fled, then [they] joined themselves also after them unto the battle.
23 And the LORD saved Israel in that day. And the battle passed through Bethan. And all the people who were with Saul were about ten thousand men. And the battle was scattered throughout all the city in the Mount of Ephraim.
24 And Saul made a great error in that day, and he cursed the people, saying, "Cursed be the man that eateth bread until evening, until I have avenged myself upon mine enemies." And all the people tasted no bread.
25 And all the land had breakfasted. For there was a wood of honeycombs before the face of the field.
26 And the people entered into the honeycomb, and behold, it flowed forth making a sound; and [Jonathan] was not turning his hand unto his mouth, because the people feared the oath of the LORD.
27 But Jonathan had not heard when his father had sworn the people. And he stretched forth the end of his staff that was in his hand, and dipped it into the honeycomb of honey, and turned his hand unto his mouth, and his eyes were enlightened.
28 And one of the people answered, and said, "Thy father did solemnly swear the people, saying, 'Cursed be the man that eateth bread today.' And the people were disheartened."
29 And Jonathan knew, and said, "My father hath troubled the land! Behold, for my eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted but a little of this honey,
30 But if the people had eaten, yea, eating this day of the spoils of their enemies which they found, then even now would the slaughter among the Philistines have been much greater."
31 And he smote on that day from among the Philistines in Michmash.
