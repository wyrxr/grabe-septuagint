ΚΕΦ. Δʹ.

καὶ ἱλάσθητι τῷ κλήρῳ σου, καὶ στρέψον τὸ πένθος ἡμῶν εἰς εὐωχίαν, ἵνα ζῶντες ὑμνῶμεν τὸ ὄνομά σου Κύριε, καὶ μὴ ἀφανίσῃς τὸ σῶμα αἰνούντων σε. Καὶ πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ ἐκέκραξεν ἐξ ἰσχύος αὐτῶν, ὅτι ὁ θάνατος αὐτῶν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτῶν. καὶ Ἐσθὴρ ἡ βασίλισσα κατέφυγεν ἐπὶ τὸν Κύριον ἐν ἀγῶνι θανάτου κατειλημμένη, καὶ ἀφελομένη τὰ ἱμάτια τῆς δόξης αὐτῆς ἐνεδύσατο ἱμάτια στενοχωρίας καὶ πένθους, καὶ ἀντὶ τῶν ὑπερηφάνων ἡδυσμάτων, σποδοῦ καὶ κοπρίων ἔπλησε τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτῆς. καὶ τὸ σῶμα αὐτῆς ἐταπείνωσε σφόδρα καὶ πάντα τόπον ἀγαλλιάματος αὐτῆς κόσμου ἐπλήρωσε τρεπτῶν τριχῶν αὐτῆς. καὶ ἐδέετο Κυρίου Θεοῦ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ εἶπε· Κύριε ὁ Θεός μου ὁ βασιλεὺς ἡμῶν σὺ εἶ μόνος, βοήθησόν μοι τῇ μόνῃ, καὶ μὴ ἐχούσῃ βοηθὸν εἰ μὴ σέ, ὅτι κίνδυνός μου ἐν τῇ χειρί μου. ἐγὼ ἤκουον Κύριε, τοῦ πατρός μου, ὅτι σὺ Κύριε ἔλαβες τὸν Ἰσραὴλ ἐκ πάντων τῶν ἐθνῶν, καὶ τοὺς πατέρας ἡμῶν ἐκ πάντων τῶν προγόνων αὐτῶν εἰς κληρονομίαν αἰώνιον, καὶ ἐποίησας αὐτοῖς ὅσα ἐλάλησας αὐτοῖς. Καὶ νῦν ἡμαρτήκαμεν ἐνώπιόν σου, καὶ παρέδωκας ἡμᾶς εἰς χεῖρας τῶν ἐχθρῶν ἡμῶν, ἀνθ᾿ ὧν ἐδοξάσαμεν τοὺς θεοὺς αὐτῶν· δίκαιος εἰ Κύριε, καὶ νῦν οὐχ ἱκανώθησαν ἐν τῷ πικρασμῷ δουλείας ἡμῶν, ἀλλὰ ἔθηκαν τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τὰς χεῖρας τῶν εἰδώλων αὐτῶν, ἐξᾶραι ὁρισμὸν σώματός σου, καὶ ἀφανίσαι κληρονομίαν σου, καὶ ἐμφράξαι στόμα ὑμνούντων σοι, καὶ σβέσαι δόξαν οἴκου σου, καὶ θυσιαστηρίου σου, καὶ ἀνοῖξαι στόμα ἐθνῶν εἰς ἀρετὰς ματαίων, καὶ θαυμασθῆναι βασιλέα σάρκινον εἰς αἰῶνα. μὴ παραδῷς Κύριε τὸ σκῆπτρον σου τοῖς μὴ οὖσι, καὶ μὴ γελασάτωσαν ἐν τῇ πτώσει ἡμῶν, ἀλλὰ στρέψον τὴν βουλὴν αὐτῶν ἐπ᾿ αὐτούς. τὸν δὲ ἀρξάμενον ἐφ᾿ ἡμᾶς παραδειγμάτισον· μνήσθητι Κύριε, γνώσθητι ἐν καιρῷ θλίψεως ἡμῶν, καὶ ἐμὲ θάρσυνον βασιλεῦ τῶν θεῶν, καὶ πάσης ἀρχῆς ἐπικρατῶν. δὸς λόγον εὔρυθμον εἰς τὸ στόμα μου ἐνώπιον τοῦ λέοντος, καὶ μετάθες τὴν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ εἰς μῖσος τοῦ πολεμοῦντος ἡμᾶς, εἰς συντέλειαν αὐτοῦ καὶ τῶν ὁμονοούντων αὐτῷ. ἡμᾶς δὲ ῥῦσαι ἐν χειρί σου, καὶ βοήθησόν μοι τῇ μόνῃ, καὶ μὴ ἐχούσῃ βοηθὸν εἰ μὴ σὲ Κύριε· πάντων γνῶσιν ἔχεις, καὶ οἶδας ὅτι ἐμίσησα δόξαν ἀνόμων, καὶ βδελύσσομαι κοίτην ἀπεριτμήτων, καὶ παντὸς ἀλλοτρίου. σὺ οἶδας τὴν ἀνάγκην μου, ὅτι βδελύσσομαι τὸ σημεῖον τῆς ὑπερηφανείας μου, ὅ ἐστιν ἐπὶ τῆς κεφαλῆς μου ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ὀπτα-

...and be merciful unto Thine inheritance, and turn our mourning into feasting; that we, being alive, may hymn Thy Name, O Lord, and destroy not the company of them that praise Thee.
And all Israel cried out with all their strength, for their death was before their eyes.

And Esther the queen fled unto the Lord, being encompassed by the agony of death; and taking off the garments of her glory, she put on garments of distress and mourning, and instead of stately perfumes, she filled her head with ashes and dung. And she greatly humbled her body, and every place of her joyous ornament she filled with her unbound hair. And she prayed unto the Lord God of Israel, and said:

"O Lord, my God, Thou art our King alone; help me, who am alone and have no helper but Thee, for my peril is in mine hand.
I heard, O Lord, from my father, that Thou, O Lord, didst take Israel from among all the nations, and our fathers from among all their forefathers for an eternal inheritance, and Thou didst perform unto them all that Thou didst speak unto them.
And now we have sinned before Thee, and Thou hast delivered us into the hands of our enemies, because we glorified their gods; righteous art Thou, O Lord, and now they are not satisfied with the bitterness of our servitude, but have laid their hands upon the hands of their idols, to blot out the ordinance of Thy people, and to destroy Thine inheritance, and to stop the mouth of them that praise Thee, and to quench the glory of Thy house, and of Thy altar, and to open the mouth of the nations to the praises of vain things, and that a king of flesh might be marvelled at forever.
Deliver not, O Lord, Thy scepter unto them that are not, and let them not laugh at our fall, but turn their counsel upon themselves. And him that began against us, make a public example. Remember, O Lord, be known in the time of our tribulation, and strengthen me, O King of gods, and Ruler over every principality.
Give a gracious word into my mouth before the lion, and turn his heart to hatred of him that warreth against us, unto his utter destruction and of them that conspire with him.
But deliver us by Thy hand, and help me, who am alone and have no helper but Thee, O Lord. Thou hast knowledge of all things, and Thou knowest that I hate the glory of the lawless, and I abhor the bed of the uncircumcised, and of every stranger.
Thou knowest my necessity, that I abhor the symbol of my pride, which is upon my head in the day of my appearan—"
