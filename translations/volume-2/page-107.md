τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ Ἀβεσσαλώμ. Καὶ Ἀβεσσαλὼμ ὃν ἐχρί- 10
σαμεν ἐφ᾽ ἡμῶν, ἀπέθανεν ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ· καὶ νῦν ἵνατί ὑμεῖς κω-
φεύετε τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι (πρὸς) τὸν βασιλέα; Καὶ τὸ ῥῆμα παντὸς
Ἰσραὴλ ἦλθε πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα. Καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς Δαυὶδ ἀπέστει- 11
λε πρὸς Σαδὼκ καὶ πρὸς Ἀβιάθαρ, τοὺς ἱερεῖς, λέγων· λαλήσα-
τε πρὸς τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους Ἰούδα, λέγοντες· ἵνατί γίνεσθε ἔσχα-
τοι τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι (πρὸς) τὸν βασιλέα εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ; καὶ λό-
γος παντὸς Ἰσραὴλ ἦλθε πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ.
Ἀδελφοί μου ὑμεῖς, ὀστᾶ μου καὶ σάρκες μου ὑμεῖς, ἵνατί γίνε- 12
σθε ἔσχατοι τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι τὸν βασιλέα εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ; Καὶ 13
τῷ Ἀμισσαὶ ἐρεῖτε· οὐχὶ ὀστοῦν μου καὶ σάρξ μου σύ; καὶ νῦν τά-
δε ποιῆσαι μοι ὁ Θεὸς καὶ τάδε προσθείη, εἰ μὴ ἄρχων δυνάμε-
ως ἔσῃ ἐνώπιον ἐμοῦ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας ἀντὶ Ἰωάβ. Καὶ ἔκλινε 14
τὴν καρδίαν παντὸς ἀνδρὸς Ἰούδα ὡς ἀνδρὸς ἑνός. Καὶ ἀπέστει-
λαν πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα, λέγοντες· ἐπιστράφηθι, σύ, καὶ πάντες οἱ
δοῦλοί σου. Καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν ὁ βασιλεύς, καὶ ἦλθεν ἕως τοῦ Ἰορ- 15
δάνου. Καὶ ἄνδρες Ἰούδα ἦλθον εἰς Γάλγαλα τοῦ πορεύεσθαι εἰς
ἀπάντησιν τοῦ βασιλέως, διαβιβάσαι τὸν βασιλέα τὸν Ἰορδάνην.
Καὶ ἐτάχυνε Σεμεεί, υἱὸς Γηρὰ υἱοῦ τοῦ Ἰεμινεί, ἐκ Βαουρείμ, 16
καὶ κατέβη μετὰ ἀνδρὸς Ἰούδα εἰς ἀπάντησιν τοῦ βασιλέως Δαυίδ,
καὶ χίλιοι ἄνδρες μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ ἐκ τοῦ Βενιαμὶν καὶ Σιβὰ τὸ παι- 17
δάριον τοῦ οἴκου Σαούλ, καὶ δεκαπέντε υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ,
καὶ εἴκοσι δοῦλοι αὐτοῦ μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ· καὶ κατεύθυναν τὸν Ἰορδά-
νην ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ βασιλέως· καὶ ἐλειτούργησαν τὴν λειτουργίαν 18
τοῦ βασιλέως τοῦ διαβιβάσαι αὐτόν, (καὶ διέβη διάβασις τοῦ ἐξ-
εγεῖραι τὸν οἶκον τοῦ βασιλέως) καὶ τοῦ ποιῆσαι τὸ εὐθὲς ἐν ὀφ-
θαλμοῖς αὐτοῦ. Καὶ Σεμεεὶ υἱὸς Γηρὰ ἔπεσεν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον αὐ-
τοῦ ἐνώπιον τοῦ βασιλέως, διαβαίνοντος αὐτοῦ τὸν Ἰορδάνην, καὶ
εἶπε πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα· μὴ δὴ λογισάσθω ὁ κύριός μου ἀνομίαν, 19
καὶ μὴ μνησθῇς ὅσα ἠδίκησεν ὁ παῖς σου ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ᾗ ἐξεπο-
ρεύετο ὁ κύριός μου ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐξ Ἱερουσαλήμ, τοῦ θέσθαι τὸν
βασιλέα εἰς τὴν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ. Ὅτι ἔγνω ὁ δοῦλός σου, ὅτι ἐ- 20
γὼ ἥμαρτον· καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἦλθον σήμερον πρότερος παντὸς οἴκου

**19:9** ...his kingdom because of Absalom.

**10** And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in the battle. And now, why do ye tarry to turn back the King?' And the word of all Israel came unto the King.

**11** And King David sent unto Zadok and unto Abiathar, the priests, saying, 'Speak ye unto the elders of Judah, saying, "Why are ye the last to turn back the King unto his house?" And the word of all Israel came unto the King unto his house.

**12** Ye are my brethren, my bones and my flesh are ye. Why are ye the last to turn back the King unto his house?'

**13** And to Amisai ye shall say, 'Art not thou my bone and my flesh? Now therefore, so may God do unto me, and add yet more, if thou shalt not be commander of the host before me all thy days instead of Joab.'

**14** And he inclined the heart of all the men of Judah as the heart of one man. And they sent unto the King, saying, 'Return thou, and all thy servants.'

**15** And the King returned, and came unto the Jordan. And the men of Judah came to Gilgal to go forth to meet the King, to convey the King over the Jordan.

**16** And Shimei, the son of Gera, the son of the Jeminite, from Bahurim, hastened and came down with a man of Judah to meet King David,

**17** and a thousand men with him from Benjamin, and Ziba, the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons with him, and his twenty servants with him. And they made straight the Jordan before the King.

**18** And they performed the service of the King, to convey him over; (and a crossing did pass to raise up the household of the King) and to do that which was right in his eyes. And Shimei, the son of Gera, fell upon his face before the King, as he was crossing the Jordan,

**19** and said unto the King, 'Let not my lord impute iniquity [unto me], and remember not whatsoever thy servant did wickedly in the day when my lord the King went out of Jerusalem, to cause the King to lay it to his heart.

**20** For thy servant knoweth that I have sinned. And behold, I am come this day the first of all the house of Joseph, to come down to meet my lord the King.'

**21** And Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered, saying, 'Shall not Shimei therefore be put to death, because he cursed the Lord's anointed?'
