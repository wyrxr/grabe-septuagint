**536 ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Α΄. ΚΕΦ. Κς΄. ΚΖ.**
**19** ἀδίκημα; Καὶ νῦν ἀκουσάτω δὴ ὁ κύριός μου ὁ βασιλεὺς τὸ ῥῆμα
**20** τοῦ δούλου αὐτοῦ, εἰ ὁ Θεὸς ἐπίσειει σε εἰς ἐμέ, ὀσφρανθείη
**21** θυσία σου· καὶ εἰ υἱοὶ ἀνθρώπων, ἐπικατάρατοι οὗτοι ἐνώπιον Κυρίου,
**22** ὅτι ἐξέβαλόν με σήμερον μὴ ἐστηρίχθαι ἐν κληρονομίᾳ Κυρίου,
**23** λέγοντες· πορεύου, δούλευε θεοῖς ἑτέροις. Καὶ νῦν μὴ πέσοι τὸ
**24** αἷμά μου ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ἐξ ἐναντίας προσώπου Κυρίου, ὅτι
**25** ἐξελήλυθεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ ζητεῖν τὴν ψυχήν μου, καθὼς κα-
**26** ταδιώκει ὁ νυκτικόραξ ἐν τοῖς ὄρεσι. Καὶ εἶπε Σαούλ· ἡμάρτηκα·
**27** ἐπίστρεφε, τέκνον Δαυΐδ, ὅτι οὐ κακοποιήσω σε ἔτι, ἀνθ’ ὧν ἐντι-
**28** μος ψυχή μου ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς σου ἐν τῇ σήμερον· μεματαιῶμαι,
**29** καὶ ἠγνόησα πολλὰ σφόδρα. Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Δαυΐδ, καὶ εἶπε· ἰδοὺ
**30** τὸ δόρυ τοῦ βασιλέως, διελθέτω εἷς τῶν παιδαρίων καὶ λαβέτω
**31** αὐτό· καὶ Κύριος ἐπιστρέψει ἑκάστῳ τὰς δικαιοσύνας αὐτοῦ καὶ
**32** τὴν πίστιν αὐτοῦ· ὡς παρέδωκέ σε Κύριος σήμερον εἰς χεῖράς
**33** μου, καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησα ἐπενεγκεῖν χεῖρά μου ἐπὶ χριστὸν Κυρίου,
**34** καὶ ἰδοὺ καθὼς ἐμεγαλύνθη ἡ ψυχή σου σήμερον ἐν ταύτῃ ἐν ὀ-
**35** φθαλμοῖς μου, οὕτω μεγαλυνθείη ἡ ψυχή μου ἐνώπιον Κυρίου,
**36** καὶ ἐκσπάσοι με, καὶ ἐξέλοιτό με ἐκ πάσης θλίψεως. Καὶ εἶπε
**37** Σαοὺλ πρὸς Δαυΐδ· εὐλογημένος σὺ, τέκνον Δαυΐδ· καὶ ποιῶν ποι-
**38** ήσεις, καὶ δυνάμενος δυνήσῃ. Καὶ ἀπῆλθε Δαυΐδ εἰς τὴν ὁδὸν
**39** αὐτοῦ, καὶ Σαοὺλ ἀπέστρεψεν εἰς τὸν τόπον αὐτοῦ.

**ΚΕΦ. ΚΖ΄. XXVII.**

**1** ΚΑὶ εἶπε Δαυΐδ ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ, λέγων· νῦν προστεθή-
   σομαι ἐν ἡμέρᾳ μιᾷ εἰς χεῖρας Σαούλ, καὶ οὐκ ἔστι μοι ἀγαθὸν
   ἐὰν μὴ σωθῶ εἰς γῆν ἀλλοφύλων, καὶ ἀνὴρ ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ Σαοὺλ τοῦ
   ζητεῖν με εἰς πᾶν ὅριον Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ σωθήσομαι ἐκ χειρὸς αὐτοῦ.
**2** Καὶ ἀνέστη Δαυΐδ, καὶ διέβη αὐτὸς, καὶ οἱ ἑξακόσιοι ἄνδρες οἱ
   μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπορεύθη πρὸς ᾿Αγχοῦς υἱὸν Μωὰβ βασιλέα Γέθ.
**3** Καὶ ἐκάθισε Δαυΐδ μετὰ ᾿Αγχοῦς ἐν Γέθ, αὐτὸς, καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες
   αὐτοῦ ἕκαστος, καὶ ὁ οἶκος αὐτοῦ, καὶ Δαυΐδ καὶ ἀμφότεραι αἱ
   γυναῖκες αὐτοῦ, ᾿Αχινάαμ ἡ ᾿Ιεζραηλίτις, καὶ ᾿Αβιγαία ἡ γυνὴ
**4** Νάβαλ τοῦ Καρμηλίου. Καὶ ἀνηγγέλη τῷ Σαοὺλ ὅτι πέφευγε
**5** Δαυΐδ εἰς Γέθ, καὶ οὐ προσέθετο ἔτι ζητεῖν αὐτόν. Καὶ εἶπε
   Δαυΐδ πρὸς ᾿Αγχοῦς· εἰ δὴ εὕρηκεν ὁ δοῦλός σου χάριν ἐν ὀφθαλ-

**19** any wrong? And now, I pray thee, let my lord the King hear the words of his servant:
**20** If the LORD hath stirred thee up against me, let an offering of thine be a fragrant odor [unto Him];
**21** but if the sons of men have done this, cursed be they before the LORD,
**22** for they have driven me out this day from being established in the inheritance of the LORD,
**23** saying, 'Go, serve other gods.' Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth from before the face of the LORD,
**24** for the King of Israel is come forth to seek my soul,
**25** as one doth hunt a night-raven in the mountains."
**26** Then said Saul, "I have sinned. Return, my son David, for I will not harm thee again,
**27** forasmuch as my soul was precious in thy sight this day. I have played the fool,
**28** and have erred exceedingly."
**29** And David answered and said, "Behold, the king's spear! Let one of the young men pass over and take it.
**30** And the LORD shall render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness;
**31** forasmuch as the LORD delivered thee this day into mine hand,
**32** and I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD's Anointed.
**33** And behold, as thy soul was magnified this day in this matter in mine eyes,
**34** so let my soul be magnified before the LORD,
**35** and may He deliver me, and rescue me out of all tribulation."
**36** And Saul said to David, "Blessed art thou, my son David; thou shalt surely do [great things], and thou shalt surely prevail."
**37** And David went on his way, and Saul returned to his own place.

### CHAPTER XXVII

**1** And David said in his heart, "Now shall I be put to death one day by the hands of Saul, and it is not good for me unless I am saved into the land of the foreigners; and [then] Saul, [being] a man [far] from me, [shall cease] from seeking me throughout all the borders of Israel, and I shall be saved from his hand."
**2** And David arose, and he passed over, and the six hundred men that were with him, and went unto Achish the son of Moab, king of Gath.
**3** And David dwelt with Achish in Gath, he, and his men, every one with his household, and David, and both his wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail, Nabal's wife, the Carmelite.
**4** And it was told Saul that David had fled to Gath; and he sought him no more.
**5** Then said David unto Achish, "If now thy servant hath found favour in thine eyes,
