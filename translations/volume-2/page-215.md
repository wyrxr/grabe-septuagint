τέρων αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐβασίλευσε Φακείας υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ. **23** Ἐν ἔτει πεντηκοστῷ τοῦ Ἀζαρίου βασιλέως Ἰούδα ἐβασίλευσε Φακείας υἱὸς Μαναὴμ ἐπὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ, δύο ἔτη˙ **24** καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ πονηρὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς Κυρίου, οὐκ ἀπέστη ἀπὸ ἁμαρτιῶν Ἱεροβοὰμ υἱοῦ Ναβάτ, ὃς ἐξήμαρτε τὸν Ἰσραήλ. **25** Καὶ συνεστράφη ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν Φακεὲ υἱὸς Ῥομελίου, ὁ τριστάτης αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτὸν ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ ἐναντίον οἴκου τοῦ βασιλέως μετὰ τοῦ Ἀργόβ, καὶ μετὰ τοῦ Ἀριέ, καὶ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ πεντήκοντα ἄνδρας ἀπὸ τῶν τετρακοσίων, καὶ ἐθανάτωσεν αὐτόν, καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ. **26** Καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Φακείου, καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν, ἰδοὺ εἰσι γεγραμμένα ἐπὶ βιβλίου λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν Ἰσραήλ. **27** Ἐν ἔτει πεντηκοστῷ καὶ δευτέρῳ τοῦ Ἀζαρίου βασιλέως Ἰούδα ἐβασίλευσε Φακεὲ υἱὸς Ῥομελίου ἐπὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ, εἴκοσιν ἔτη. **28** Καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ πονηρὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς Κυρίου, οὐκ ἀπέστη ἀπὸ πασῶν ἁμαρτιῶν Ἱεροβοὰμ υἱοῦ Ναβάτ, ὃς ἐξήμαρτε τὸν Ἰσραήλ. **29** Ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις Φακεὲ βασιλέως Ἰσραὴλ ἦλθε Θαλγαφελλασὰρ βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων, καὶ ἔλαβε τὴν Αἴν, καὶ τὴν Ἄβελ Βεθμααχά, καὶ τὴν Ἰανώχ, καὶ τὴν Κενέζ, καὶ τὴν Ἀσώρ, καὶ τὴν Γαλαάδ, καὶ τὴν Γαλιλαίαν, πᾶσαν γῆν Νεφθαλείμ, καὶ ἀπώκισεν αὐτοὺς εἰς Ἀσσυρίους. **30** Καὶ συνέστρεψε σύστρεμμα Ὡσηὲ υἱὸς Ἠλὰ ἐπὶ Φακεὲ υἱὸν Ῥομελίου, καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτόν, καὶ ἐθανάτωσεν αὐτόν, καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ, (καὶ) ἐν ἔτει εἰκοστῷ Ἰωάθαμ υἱοῦ Ἀζαρίου. **31** Καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Φακεέ, καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν, ἰδοὺ ἐστι γεγραμμένα ἐπὶ βιβλίου λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν Ἰσραήλ. **32** Ἐν ἔτει δευτέρῳ Φακεὲ υἱοῦ Ῥομελίου βασιλέως Ἰσραὴλ ἐβασίλευσεν Ἰωάθαμ υἱὸς Ἀζαρίου βασιλέως Ἰούδα. **33** Υἱὸς εἴκοσι καὶ πέντε ἐτῶν ἦν ὁ ἐν τῷ βασιλεύειν αὐτόν, καὶ ἓξ καὶ δέκα ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ὄνομα τῆς μητρὸς αὐτοῦ Ἱερουσά, θυγάτηρ Σαδώχ. **34** Καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ εὐθὲς ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς Κυρίου κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν Ἀζαρίας ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ· **35** πλὴν τὰ ὑψηλὰ οὐκ ἐξῆρεν· ἔτι ὁ λαὸς ἐθυσίαζε, καὶ ἐθυμία ἐν τοῖς ὑψηλοῖς. Αὐτὸς ὠκοδόμησε τὴν πύλην οἴκου Κυρίου τὴν ἐπάνω. **36** Καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Ἰωάθαμ, καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν, οὐχὶ ταῦτα γεγραμμένα ἐπὶ βιβλίου λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν Ἰούδα; **37** Ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις ἤρξατο Κύριος ἐξαποστέλλειν ἐν Ἰούδα τὸν Ῥασσὼν βασιλέα Συρίας,
