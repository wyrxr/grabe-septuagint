5 βάλλουσιν εἰς Γελβουέ. Καὶ ἴδε Σαοὺλ τὴν παρεμβολὴν τῶν ἀλ-
6 λοφύλων, καὶ ἐφοβήθη, καὶ ἐξέστη ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ σφόδρα. Καὶ
ἐπηρώτησε Σαοὺλ διὰ Κυρίου, καὶ οὐκ ἀπεκρίθη αὐτῷ Κύριος ἐν
7 τοῖς ἐνυπνίοις, καὶ ἐν τοῖς δήλοις, καὶ ἐν τοῖς προφήταις. Καὶ
εἶπε Σαοὺλ τοῖς παισὶν αὐτοῦ· Ζητήσατέ μοι γυναῖκα ἐγγαστριμύ-
θου, καὶ πορεύσομαι πρὸς αὐτήν, καὶ ζητήσω ἐν αὐτῇ. Καὶ εἶ-
πον οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ πρὸς αὐτόν· Ἰδοὺ γυνὴ ἐγγαστρίμυθος ἐν
8 Ἀενδώρ. Καὶ περικαλύψατο Σαούλ, καὶ περιεβάλετο ἱμάτια
ἑτέρα, καὶ πορεύεται αὐτός, καὶ δύο ἄνδρες μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔρ-
χονται πρὸς τὴν γυναῖκα νυκτός, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ· μάντευσαι δή
9 μοι ἐν τῷ ἐγγαστριμύθῳ, καὶ ἀνάγαγέ μοι ὃν ἐὰν εἴπω σοι. Καὶ
εἶπεν ἡ γυνὴ πρὸς αὐτόν· Ἰδοὺ δὴ σὺ οἶδας ὅσα ἐποίησε Σαούλ,
ὡς ἐξωλόθρευσε τοὺς ἐγγαστριμύθους καὶ τοὺς γνώστας ἀπὸ τῆς
γῆς, καὶ ἱνατί σὺ παγιδεύεις τὴν ψυχήν μου θανατῶσαι αὐτήν;
10 Καὶ ὤμοσεν αὐτῇ Σαοὺλ ἐν Κυρίῳ, λέγων· Ζῇ Κύριος, εἰ ἀπαν-
11 τήσεταί σοι ἀδικία ἐν τῷ λόγῳ τούτῳ. Καὶ εἶπεν ἡ γυνή· τίνα
ἀναγάγω σοι; καὶ εἶπε· τὸν Σαμουὴλ ἀνάγαγέ μοι. Καὶ ἴδεν ἡ
12 γυνὴ τὸν Σαμουήλ, καὶ ἀνεβόησε φωνῇ μεγάλη. Καὶ εἶπεν ἡ
13 γυνὴ πρὸς Σαούλ· Ἱνατί παρελογίσω με; καὶ σὺ εἶ Σαούλ. Καὶ
εἶπεν αὐτῇ ὁ βασιλεύς· μὴ φοβοῦ, εἰπὲ τίνα ἑώρακας· καὶ εἶπεν
14 αὐτῷ ἡ γυνή· θεοὺς ἑώρακα ἀναβαίνοντας ἐκ τῆς γῆς. Καὶ εἶ-
πεν αὐτῇ· τί ἔγνως; καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· ἄνδρα ὄρθιον ἀναβαίνοντα
ἐκ τῆς γῆς, καὶ οὗτος διπλοΐδα ἀναβεβλημένος. Καὶ ἔγνω Σαούλ,
ὅτι Σαμουὴλ οὗτος, καὶ ἔκυψεν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν
15 γῆν, καὶ προσεκύνησεν αὐτῷ. Καὶ εἶπε Σαμουὴλ πρὸς Σαούλ·
ἱνατί παρηνώχλησάς με ἀναβῆναί με; καὶ εἶπε Σαούλ· Θλίβομαι σφό-
δρα, καὶ οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι πολεμοῦσιν ἐν ἐμοί, καὶ ὁ Θεὸς ἀφέστη-
κεν ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἐπακήκοέ μου ἔτι καὶ ἐν χειρὶ τῶν προφητῶν,
καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἐνυπνίοις· καὶ νῦν κέκληκά σε γνωρίσαι μοι τί
16 ποιήσω. Καὶ εἶπε Σαμουήλ· ἱνατί ἐπηρώτησάς με, καὶ Κύριος
17 ἀφέστηκεν ἀπὸ σοῦ, καὶ γέγονε μετὰ τοῦ πλησίον σου; Καὶ πε-
ποίηκε Κύριός σοι, καθὼς ἐλάλησε (Κύριός σοι) ἐν χειρί μου, καὶ
διαρρήξει Κύριος τὴν βασιλείαν σου ἐκ χειρός σου, καὶ δώσει αὐ-
18 τήν τῷ πλησίον σου τῷ Δαυίδ. Διότι οὐκ ἤκουσας τῆς φωνῆς
Κυρίου, καὶ οὐκ ἐποίησας θυμὸν ὀργῆς αὐτοῦ ἐν Ἀμαλήχ, διὰ τοῦτο
19 τὸ ῥῆμα ἐποίησέ σοι Κύριος ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ταύτῃ. Καὶ παραδώσει Κύ-

**5** pitched in Gilboa. And when Saul did see the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart was greatly dismayed within him.

**6** And Saul inquired of the LORD; yet the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.

**7** Then said Saul unto his servants, "Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her and inquire of her." And his servants said to him, "Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at En-dor."

**8** And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and went, he and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night. And he said unto her, "Divine unto me, I pray thee, by the familiar spirit, and bring up for me whomsoever I shall name unto thee."

**9** And the woman said unto him, "Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?"

**10** And Saul swore to her by the LORD, saying, "As the LORD liveth, there shall no punishment befall thee for this thing."

**11** Then said the woman, "Whom shall I bring up unto thee?" And he said, "Bring me up Samuel."

**12** And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice. And the woman spoke to Saul, saying, "Why hast thou deceived me? For thou art Saul."

**13** And the king said unto her, "Be not afraid: tell me what thou sawest." And the woman said unto Saul, "I saw gods ascending out of the earth."

**14** And he said unto her, "What form is he of?" And she said, "An upright man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle." And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.

**15** And Samuel said to Saul, "Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up?" And Saul answered, "I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by the hand of prophets, nor by dreams: and now have I called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do."

**16** Then said Samuel, "Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the LORD is departed from thee, and is become with thy neighbor?"

**17** And the LORD hath done to thee, according as He spake (the LORD to thee) by my hand: for the LORD hath rent the kingdom out of thy hand, and given it to thy neighbor, even to David.

**18** Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD, nor didst execute His fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the LORD done this thing unto thee this day.

**19** Moreover the LORD will deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines: and tomorrow shalt thou and thy sons with thee shall fall, and the camp of Israel shall the LORD deliver into the hand of the Philistines.
