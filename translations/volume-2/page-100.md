ΚΕΦ. ΙϚ΄.
σας ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἔδωκε Κύριος τὴν βασιλείαν ἐν χειρὶ ᾿Α- 8
βεσσαλὼμ τοῦ υἱοῦ σου· καὶ ἰδοὺ σὺ ἐν τῇ κακίᾳ σου, ὅτι ἀνὴρ
αἱμάτων σύ. Καὶ εἶπεν ᾿Αβεισαὶ υἱὸς Σαρουΐας πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα· 9
ἵνατί καταρᾶται ὁ κύων ὁ τεθνηκώς οὗτος τὸν κύριόν μου τὸν βα-
σιλέα; διαβήσομαι δὴ, καὶ ἀφελῶ τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπεν 10
ὁ βασιλεύς· τί ἐμοὶ καὶ ὑμῖν, υἱοὶ Σαρουΐας; ἀφεῖτε αὐτὸν, καὶ
οὕτως καταράσθω, ὅτι κύριος εἶπεν αὐτῷ καταράσθαι τὸν Δαυΐδ·
καὶ τίς ἐρεῖ, ὡς τί ἐποίησας οὕτως; Καὶ εἶπε Δαυΐδ πρὸς ᾿Α- 11
βισαὶ καὶ πρὸς πάντας τοὺς παῖδας αὐτοῦ· ἰδοὺ ὁ υἱός μου ὁ
ἐξελθὼν ἐκ τῆς κοιλίας μου ζητεῖ τὴν ψυχήν μου, καὶ προσέτι
νῦν ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ᾿Ιεμενεΐ· ἄφετε αὐτὸν, καὶ καταράσθω, ὅτι εἶπεν
αὐτῷ Κύριος· Εἴπως ἴδοι Κύριος ἐν τῇ ταπεινώσει μου, καὶ ἐπι- 12
στρέψει Κύριός μοι ἀγαθὰ ἀντὶ τῆς κατάρας αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ
ταύτῃ. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη Δαυΐδ καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ. Καὶ 13
Σεμεΐ ἐπορεύετο ἐκ πλευρᾶς τοῦ ὄρους ἐρχόμενος αὐτοῦ πορευό-
μενος, καὶ καταρώμενος, καὶ λιθάζων ἐν λίθοις ἐκ πλαγίων αὐ-
τοῦ, καὶ τῷ χοΐ πάσσων. Καὶ ἦλθεν ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς 14
μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἐκλελυμένοι, καὶ ἀνέψυξαν ἐκεῖ. Καὶ ᾿Αβεσσαλὼμ καὶ 15
πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ἀνδρῶν ᾿Ισραὴλ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς ῾Ιερουσαλήμ, καὶ ᾿Αχι-
τόφελ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐγενήθη ἡνίκα ἦλθε Χουσὶ ὁ ἀρχιεταῖρος 16
Δαυΐδ πρὸς ᾿Αβεσσαλὼμ, καὶ εἶπε Χουσὶ πρὸς ᾿Αβεσσαλὼμ· Ζή-
τω ὁ βασιλεύς. Καὶ εἶπεν ᾿Αβεσσαλὼμ πρὸς Χουσὶ, τοῦτο τὸ 17
ἔλεός σου μετὰ τοῦ ἑταίρου σου· ἵνατί οὐκ ἀπῆλθες μετὰ τοῦ ἑ-
ταίρου σου; Καὶ εἶπε Χουσὶ πρὸς ᾿Αβεσσαλὼμ· οὐχὶ, ἀλλὰ κατό- 18
πισθεν οὗ ἐξελέξατο Κύριος, καὶ ὁ λαὸς οὗτος, καὶ πᾶς ἀνὴρ ᾿Ισ-
ραὴλ, αὐτῷ ἔσομαι, καὶ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ καθήσομαι. Καὶ τὸ δεύ- 19
τερον τίνι ἐγὼ δουλεύσω; οὐχὶ ἐνώπιον τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ; καθά-
περ ἐδούλευσα ἐνώπιον τοῦ πατρός σου, οὕτως ἔσομαι (καὶ) ἐνώ-
πιον σου. Καὶ εἶπεν ᾿Αβεσσαλὼμ πρὸς ᾿Αχιτόφελ· φέρετε ἑαυτοῖς 20
βουλὴν τί ποιήσωμεν. Καὶ εἶπεν ᾿Αχιτόφελ πρὸς ᾿Αβεσσαλὼμ· 21
εἴσελθε πρὸς τὰς παλλακὰς τοῦ πατρός σου, ἃς κατέλιπε φυ-
λάσσειν τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀκούσεται πᾶς ᾿Ισραὴλ, ὅτι ἠσχύ-
νας τὸν πατέρα σου, καὶ ἐνισχύσουσιν αἱ χεῖρες πάντων τῶν με-
τὰ σοῦ. Καὶ ἔπηξαν τῷ ᾿Αβεσσαλὼμ τὴν σκηνὴν ἐπὶ τὸ δῶμα, 22
καὶ εἰσῆλθεν ᾿Αβεσσαλὼμ πρὸς τὰς παλλακὰς τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ
κατ᾿ ὀφθαλμοὺς παντὸς ᾿Ισραήλ. Καὶ ἡ βουλὴ ᾿Αχιτόφελ ἣν ἐβου- 23

**16:8** ...because thou didst reign in his stead; and the Lord hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son; and behold, thou art in thy wickedness, for thou art a man of blood.
**9** Then said Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, unto the king, "Why doth this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head."
**10** And the king said, "What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? Let him alone, and let him curse, for the Lord hath bidden him to curse David."
**11** And who shall say, "Why hast thou done so?" And David said unto Abishai, and to all his servants, "Behold, my son, which came forth from my bowels, seeketh my life; and how much more now this son of Iemeneï? Let him alone, and let him curse, for the Lord hath bidden him.
**12** It may be that the Lord will look upon my affliction, and that the Lord will return good unto me for his cursing this day."
**13** So David and his men went on their way. And Shimei went along the side of the mountain, coming by him as he went, and cursing, and casting stones at him from his side, and scattering dust.
**14** And the king, and all the people that were with him, came forth faint, and refreshed themselves there.
**15** And Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, entered into Jerusalem; and Ahithophel with him.
**16** And it came to pass, when Hushai, David's chief friend, came unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, "God save the king!"
**17** And Absalom said to Hushai, "Is this thy kindness to thy friend? Why wentest thou not with thy friend?"
**18** And Hushai said unto Absalom, "Nay, but with him whom the Lord, and this people, and all the men of Israel, have chosen, with him will I be, and with him will I remain.
**19** And secondly, whom shall I serve? Is it not before his son? As I have served before thy father, so shall I be also before thee."
**20** Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, "Give ye counsel among yourselves what we shall do."
**21** And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, "Go in unto thy father's concubines, whom he hath left to keep his house; and all Israel shall hear that thou hast made thy father to be abhorred, and the hands of all that are with thee shall be strengthened."
**22** So they pitched for Absalom a tent upon the roof; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.
**23** Now the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those former days, was as if one had inquired at the word of God; so was all the counsel of Ahithophel, both to David and also to Absalom.
