ΚΕΦ. ΙΑ´.              ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Γ´.                     627
ἐν καιρῷ γήρως Σαλωμών, καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες αὐτοῦ ἐξέκλιναν τὴν
καρδίαν αὐτοῦ ὀπίσω θεῶν ἑτέρων, καὶ οὐκ ἦν καρδία αὐτοῦ τελεία
μετὰ Κυρίου Θεοῦ αὐτοῦ, καθὼς ἡ καρδία Δαυὶδ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ.
Καὶ ἐπορεύθη Σαλωμὼν ὀπίσω τῆς ᾿Αστάρτης βδελύγματος Σι- 5
δωνίων, καὶ ὀπίσω τῶν Βασιλέων αὐτῶν, εἰδώλου υἱῶν ᾿Αμμών.
Καὶ ἐποίησε Σαλωμὼν τὸ πονηρὸν ἐνώπιον Κυρίου, καὶ οὐκ ἐ- 6
πορεύθη ὀπίσω Κυρίου, ὡς Δαυὶδ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ. Τότε ᾠκοδό- 7
μησε Σαλωμὼν ὑψηλὸν τῷ Χαμός, εἰδώλῳ Μωάβ, ἐν τῷ ὄρει
τῷ ἐπὶ πρόσωπον Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ τῷ Μελχόμ, εἰδώλῳ υἱῶν ᾿Αμ-
μὼν, καὶ τῇ ᾿Αστάρτῃ, βδελύγματι Σιδωνίων. Καὶ οὕτως ἐποί- 8
ησε πάσαις ταῖς γυναιξὶν αὐτοῦ ταῖς ἀλλοτρίαις, αἳ ἐθυμίαν καὶ
ἔθυον τοῖς εἰδώλοις αὐτῶν. Καὶ ὠργίσθη Κύριος ἐπὶ Σαλωμών, 9
ὅτι ἐξέκλινε καρδίαν αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ Κυρίου Θεοῦ Ἰσραήλ, τοῦ ὀφθέν-
τος αὐτῷ δίς, καὶ ἐντειλαμένου αὐτῷ ὑπὲρ τοῦ λόγου τούτου, τὸ 10
παράπαν μὴ πορευθῆναι ὀπίσω θεῶν ἑτέρων, καὶ φυλάξαι, καὶ ποι-
ῆσαι ἃ ἐνετείλατο αὐτῷ Κύριος ὁ Θεός. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς 11
Σαλωμών ᾿Ανθ᾿ ὧν ἐγένετο ταῦτα μετὰ σοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἐφύλαξας
τὰ προστάγματά μου, καὶ τὰς ἐντολάς μου ἃς ἐνετειλάμην σοι, δι-
ἀρρήσσων διαρρήξω τὴν βασιλείαν σου ἐκ χειρός σου, καὶ δώσω αὐ-
τὴν τῷ δούλῳ σου. Πλὴν ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις σου οὐ ποιήσω αὐτὰ 12
διὰ Δαυὶδ τὸν πατέρα σου ἐκ χειρὸς υἱοῦ σου λήψομαι αὐτήν. Πλὴν 13
ὅλην τὴν βασιλείαν οὐ μὴ λάβω˙ σκῆπτρον ἓν δώσω τῷ υἱῷ σου
διὰ Δαυὶδ τὸν δοῦλόν μου, καὶ διὰ Ἱερουσαλὴμ τὴν πόλιν ἣν ἐξε-
λεξάμην. Καὶ ἤγειρε Κύριος Σατᾶν τῷ Σαλωμών, τὸν ῞Αδερ τὸν 14
Ἰδουμαῖον, ἐκ τοῦ σπέρματος τῆς βασιλείας ἐν Ἰδουμαίᾳ. Καὶ ἐ- 15
γένετο ἐν τῷ ἐξολοθρεῦσαι Δαυὶδ τὸν Ἐδώμ ἐν τῷ πορευθῆναι
Ἰωάβ, τὸν ἄρχοντα τῆς δυνάμεως θάπτειν τοὺς τραυματίας, ἔκοψαν
πᾶν ἀρσενικὸν ἐν τῇ Ἰδουμαίᾳ. Ὅτι ἓξ μῆνας ἐκάθητο ἐκεῖ Ἰωάβ, 16
καὶ πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τῇ Ἰδουμαίᾳ, ἕως οὗ ἐξωλόθρευσε πᾶν ἀρσε-
νικὸν ἐκ τῆς Ἰδουμαίας. Καὶ ἀπέδρα ῞Αδερ αὐτός, καὶ πάντες 17
ἄνδρες Ἰδουμαῖοι τῶν παίδων τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ
εἰσῆλθεν εἰς Αἴγυπτον˙ καὶ ῞Αδερ παιδάριον μικρόν. Καὶ ἀνί- 18
στανται ἄνδρες ἐκ τῆς πόλεως Μαδιάμ, καὶ ἔρχονται εἰς Φαρὰν,
καὶ λαμβάνουσιν ἄνδρας μεθ᾿ αὐτῶν ἀπὸ Φαρὰν, καὶ ἔρχονται εἰς
Αἴγυπτον πρὸς Φαραὼ βασιλέα Αἰγύπτου˙ καὶ εἰσῆλθεν ῞Αδερ πρὸς
Φαραὼ, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ οἶκον, καὶ ἄρτους διέταξεν αὐτῷ, καὶ

#### CHAPTER 11

**4** It came to pass in the time of Solomon’s old age, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods; and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God, as was the heart of David his father.
**5** For Solomon went after Astarte, the abomination of the Sidonians, and after their Kings, the idol of the sons of Ammon.
**6** And Solomon did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked not after the Lord, as David his father.
**7** Then did Solomon build a high place for Chemosh, the idol of Moab, upon the mount that is before Jerusalem, and for Milcom, the idol of the sons of Ammon, and for Astarte, the abomination of the Sidonians.
**8** And so did he for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and offered sacrifices unto their idols.
**9** And the Lord was wroth with Solomon, because he had turned away his heart from the Lord God of Israel, Who had appeared unto him twice,
**10** and had commanded him concerning this matter, that he should in no wise go after other gods, but should keep and do that which the Lord God had commanded him.
**11** And the Lord said unto Solomon, “Forasmuch as this is come to pass with thee, and thou hast not kept My statutes, and My commandments, which I commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thine hand, and will give it unto thy servant.
**12** Nevertheless, in thy days will I not do it for David thy father’s sake; but out of the hand of thy son will I take it.
**13** Howbeit I will not take away the whole kingdom; but one tribe will I give to thy son for David My servant’s sake, and for Jerusalem the city which I have chosen.”
**14** And the Lord raised up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite, of the royal seed in Edom.
**15** And it came to pass, when David had utterly destroyed Edom, as Joab, the captain of the host, went to bury the wounded, they smote every male in Edom.
**16** For six months Joab abode there, and all Israel in Edom, until he had cut off every male from Edom.
**17** But Hadad fled, he and all the Edomite men, even of the servants of his father, with him; and they went into Egypt. And Hadad was but a little child.
**18** And men arose out of the city of Midian, and came to Paran; and they took men with them from Paran, and came into Egypt unto Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Hadad came unto Pharaoh, and he gave him an house, and appointed for him bread, and
