ΚΕΦ. Κ´. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Γ´. 651
23 Θεὸς ὀρέων Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ οὐ Θεὸς κοιλάδων, διὰ
τοῦτο ἐκραταίωσεν ὑπὲρ ἡμᾶς· ἐὰν δὲ πολεμήσωμεν αὐτοὺς κατ᾿
εὐθύ, εἰ μὴ κραταιώσομεν ὑπὲρ αὐτούς. Καὶ τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο ποιήσον·
24 ἀπόστησον τοὺς βασιλεῖς ἕκαστον εἰς τὸν τόπον αὐτῶν,
καὶ θοῦ σατράπας ἀντ᾿ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἀλλάξομέν σοι δύναμιν κατὰ
25 τὴν δύναμιν τὴν πεσοῦσαν ἀπὸ σοῦ, καὶ ἵππον κατὰ τὴν ἵππον, καὶ
ἅρματα κατὰ τὰ ἅρματα, καὶ πολεμήσομεν πρὸς αὐτοὺς κατ᾿ εὐθύ,
καὶ κραταιώσομεν ὑπὲρ αὐτοὺς· καὶ ἤκουσε τῆς φωνῆς αὐτῶν,
καὶ ἐποίησεν οὕτως. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐπιστρέψαντος τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ, καὶ
26 ἐπεσκέψατο υἱὸς ῎Αδερ τὴν Συρίαν, καὶ ἀνέβη εἰς ᾿Αφεκὰ εἰς πόλεμον
ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐπεσκέπησαν, καὶ διωκήθησαν,
27 καὶ παρεγένοντο εἰς ἀπάντησιν αὐτῶν· καὶ παρενέβαλον οἱ
υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐξεναντίας αὐτῶν ὡσεὶ δύο ποίμνια αἰγῶν· καὶ Συρία
ἔπλησε τὴν γῆν. Καὶ προσῆλθεν ἄνθρωπος τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ εἶπε
28 πρὸς βασιλέα Ἰσραήλ· τάδε λέγει Κύριος· ἀνθ᾿ ὧν εἶπε Συρία·
ὁ Θεὸς ὀρέων Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ οὐ Θεὸς κοιλάδων
αὐτὸς, καὶ δώσω τὴν δύναμιν τὴν μεγάλην ταύτην εἰς χεῖρα σὴν,
καὶ γνώσῃ ὅτι ἐγὼ Κύριος. Καὶ παρεμβάλλουσιν αὐτοὶ ἀπέναντι
29 τούτων ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας· καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῇ ἑβδόμῃ ἡμέρᾳ, καὶ προσήγαγεν
ὁ πόλεμος, καὶ ἐπάταξεν Ἰσραὴλ τὴν Συρίαν, ἑκατὸν χιλιάδας
πεζῶν ἐν ἡμέρᾳ μιᾷ. Καὶ ἔφυγον οἱ κατάλοιποι εἰς ᾿Αφεκὰ εἰς
30 τὴν πόλιν, καὶ ἔπεσε τὸ τεῖχος ἐπὶ εἴκοσι καὶ ἑπτὰ χιλιάδας
ἀνδρῶν τῶν καταλοίπων· καὶ υἱὸς ῎Αδερ ἔφυγε, καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς
τὸν οἶκον τοῦ κοιτῶνος, εἰς τὸ ταμιεῖον. Καὶ εἶπαν
31 πρὸς αὐτὸν παῖδες αὐτοῦ· ἰδοὺ δὴ οἴδαμεν ὅτι βασιλεῖς οἴκου Ἰσραήλ,
βασιλεῖς ἐλέους εἰσίν· ἐπιθώμεθα οὖν σάκκους ἐπὶ τὰς ὀσφύας
ἡμῶν, καὶ σχοινία ἐπὶ τὰς κεφαλὰς ἡμῶν, καὶ ἐξέλθωμεν
πρὸς βασιλέα Ἰσραήλ, εἴπως ζωογονήσει τὰς ψυχὰς ἡμῶν. Καὶ
32 περιεζώσαντο σάκκους ἐπὶ τὰς ὀσφύας αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔθηκαν σχοινία
ἐπὶ τὰς κεφαλὰς αὐτῶν, καὶ εἶπαν τῷ βασιλεῖ Ἰσραήλ· δοῦλός
σου υἱὸς ῎Αδερ λέγει· ζήτω δὴ ἡ ψυχή μου. Καὶ εἶπεν· εἰ ἔτι
ζῇ, ἀδελφός μου ἐστί· καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες οἰωνίσαντο, καὶ ἐσπεύσαντο,
33 καὶ ἀνελέξαν τὸν λόγον ἐκ τοῦ στόματος αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπον ἀδελφός
σου υἱὸς ῎Αδερ (λέγει)· Καὶ εἶπεν· εἰσέλθατε καὶ λάβετε αὐτόν·
καὶ ἐξῆλθε πρὸς αὐτὸν υἱὸς ῎Αδερ, καὶ ἀναβιβάζουσιν αὐτὸν
34 πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὸ ἅρμα. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτόν· τὰς πόλεις ἃς

**Chapter 20**
**23** "The God of the mountains is the Lord, the God of Israel, and He is not a God of the valleys. For this cause did He prevail over us. But if we shall make war against them in the plain, then assuredly shall we prevail over them."
**24** "Now therefore, perform this thing: Remove the kings, each man to his own place, and put governors in their stead.
**25** And we shall replace for thee an army according to the strength of the army which hath fallen from thee, and horse for horse, and chariots for chariots. And we shall fight against them in the plain, and then assuredly shall we prevail over them." And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so.
**26** And it came to pass, at the return of the year, that Ben-Hadad mustered Syria, and went up to Aphek, to make war against Israel.
**27** And the children of Israel were mustered, and were marshalled forth, and came to meet them; and the children of Israel encamped before them as two small flocks of goats; but Syria filled the land.
**28** And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of Israel, saying, "Thus saith the Lord: Because Syria hath said, 'The God of the mountains is the Lord, the God of Israel, and He is not a God of the valleys,' therefore will I give all this great multitude into thy hand, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord."
**29** And they encamped one over against the other for seven days. And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the battle was joined; and Israel smote Syria, a hundred thousand footmen in one day.
**30** And the rest fled into Aphek, into the city; and the wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand men of those that were left. And Ben-Hadad fled, and entered into the house of the bedchamber, even into the inner chamber.
**31** And his servants said unto him, "Behold now, we have perceived that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings. Let us therefore put sackcloth upon our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out unto the king of Israel; if peradventure he will keep our lives alive."
**32** So they girded sackcloth upon their loins, and put ropes upon their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, "Thy servant Ben-Hadad saith, 'Let my soul live.' " And he said, "If he yet liveth, he is my brother." And the men took it for an omen, and hasted,
**33** and caught the word out of his mouth, and said, "Thy brother Ben-Hadad [he] saith." And he said, "Go ye in, and fetch him." Then Ben-Hadad came forth unto him, and they caused him to come up unto him upon the chariot.
**34** And Ben-Hadad said unto him, "The cities, which my father took from thy father, I will restore unto thee; and thou shalt make for thyself bazaars in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria." And [Ahab said,] "And I will send thee away with a covenant."
