¹ ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο ἐν μηνὶ Χασελεῦ ἔτους εἰκοσοῦ, καὶ ἐγὼ ἤμην
² ἐν Σουσὰν ᾿Αβδειρρά. Καὶ ἦλθεν ᾿Ανανὶ εἷς ἀπὸ ἀδελφῶν μου, αὐ-

οἱ καταλειφθέντων ἀπὸ τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας, καὶ περὶ ᾿Ιερουσαλήμ.
³ Καὶ εἶπον πρὸς μὲ, οἱ καταλειπόμενοι οἱ καταλειφθέντες ἀπὸ τῆς
αἰχμαλωσίας ἐκεῖ ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ ἐν πονηρίᾳ μεγάλῃ καὶ ἐν ὀνειδι-
σμῷ, καὶ τείχη ᾿Ιερουσαλὴμ καθηρημένα, καὶ πύλαι αὐτῆς ἐν-
επρήσθησαν ἐν πυρί. ⁴ Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἀκοῦσαί με τοὺς λόγους
τούτους, ἐκάθισα, καὶ ἔκλαυσα, καὶ ἐπένθησα ἡμέρας, καὶ ἤμην

THE WORDS
OF THE SON OF HACHALIAH.

CHAPTER I.

¹ And it came to pass in the month of Chisleu, in the twentieth year, that I was
² in Susa, the Citadel. And Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and [certain] men of Judah; and I asked them concerning those who were saved, [even] those who were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.
³ And they said unto me, "The remaining ones, those who were left of the captivity there in the land, [are] in great affliction and in sore reproach; and the walls of Jerusalem are cast down, and her gates are burned with fire."

⁷ We have utterly corrupted ourselves against Thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which Thou didst command unto Moses Thy servant.
