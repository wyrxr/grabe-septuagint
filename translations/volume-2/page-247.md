#### CHAPTER 5

**6** of Reuben. And his brethren by their families, in their enumerations according to their generations:
**7** Joel the chief, and Zechariah, and Bale Ouzouz,
**8** the son of Samas, the son of Joel. This man dwelt in Aroer, and upon Nabau, and Beelmaon.
**9** And toward the east he dwelt, even unto the approaches of the wilderness, from the river Euphrates; for their cattle were many in the land of Gilead.
**10** And in the days of Saul, they made war against the sojourners; and those dwelling in their tents fell into their hands, even all them that were toward the east of Gilead.
**11** The sons of Gad dwelt over against them in the land of Bashan, even unto Selcha.
**12** Joel was the firstborn, and Sapham the second, and Janai, the scribe in Bashan.
**13** And their brethren, according to the houses of their families, were Michael, and Mosollam, and Sobathe, and Joreë, and Jachan, and Zouë, and Jothed, seven.
**14** These were the sons of Abichai, the son of Ouri, the son of Adai, the son of Gilead, the son of Michael, the son of Jesai, the son of Jeddai, the son of Achibouz,
**15** the son of Abdiel, the son of Gouni, a chief of the house of their families.

**18** The sons of Reuben, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, [were] valiant men, men bearing shields and swords, and drawing bows, and taught for war, forty-four thousand seven hundred and sixty, going forth to battle array.
**19** And they made war with the Hagrites, and Jeturians, and Naphisaians, and Nadabaians,
**20** and they prevailed against them; and the Hagrites, and all their encampments, were delivered into their hands, because they cried out unto God in the battle, and He heard them, for they trusted in Him.
**21** And they took their spoil, five thousand camels, and two hundred fifty thousand sheep, two thousand donkeys, and one hundred thousand human souls.
**22** For many were slain, because the battle was of God. And they dwelt in their stead until the captivity.
**23** And the half-tribe of Manasseh dwelt in the land, from Bashan even unto Baal, [and] Hermon, and Sanir, and Mount Aermon; and in Lebanon they were greatly multiplied.
**24** And these were the chiefs of the house of their families: Opher, and Jesiei, and
