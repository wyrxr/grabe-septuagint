**5** μοῖς σου, δότωσαν δὴ μοι τόπον ἐν μιᾷ τῶν πόλεων τῶν κατ᾽ ἀ-
γρόν, καὶ καθίσομαι ἐκεῖ· καὶ ἵνατί κάθηται ὁ δοῦλός σου ἐν πό-
λει βασιλευομένη μετὰ σοῦ; Καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ Ἄγχους ἐν τῇ ἡμέ-
**6** ρᾳ ἐκείνῃ τὴν Σικελάγ· διὰ τοῦτο ἐγενήθη Σικελάγ τῷ βασιλεῖ
τῆς Ἰουδαίας ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης. Καὶ ἐγενήθη ὁ ἀριθμὸς
**7** τῶν ἡμερῶν ὧν ἐκάθισε Δαυὶδ ἐν ἀγρῷ τῶν ἀλλοφύλων, ἡμέρας,
τέσσαρας μῆνας. Καὶ ἀνέβαινε Δαυὶδ καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐ-
**8** πετίθεντο ἐπὶ πάντα τὸν Γεσερί, καὶ τὸν Γεζραῖον, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν
Ἀμαληχίτην. Καὶ ἰδοὺ κατῳκεῖτο ἡ γῆ (ἡ ἀπὸ Γελαμσοὺρ ἀπὸ
ἀνηκόντων τετειχισμένων) καὶ ἕως γῆς Αἰγύπτου. Καὶ ἔτυπτε
**9** Δαυὶδ τὴν γῆν, καὶ οὐκ ἐζωογόνει ἄνδρα καὶ γυναῖκα· καὶ ἐλάμβανε
ποίμνια καὶ βουκόλια καὶ ὄνους καὶ καμήλους καὶ ἱματισμόν, καὶ
ἐπέστρεφε καὶ ἤρχοντο πρὸς Ἄγχους. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἄγχους πρὸς
**10** Δαυίδ· ἐπὶ τίνα ἐπέθεσθε σήμερον; καὶ εἶπε Δαυὶδ πρὸς Ἄγ-
χους· κατὰ νότον τῆς Ἰουδαίας, καὶ κατὰ νότον Ἰσραμηλεί, καὶ
κατὰ νότον τοῦ Κηνεί. Καὶ ἄνδρα καὶ γυναῖκα οὐκ ἐζωογόνησα
**11** τοῦ εἰσαγαγεῖν εἰς Γέθ, λέγων· μὴ ἀναγγείλωσιν εἰς Γὲθ καθ᾿
ἡμῶν, λέγοντες· τάδε ἐποίει Δαυίδ, καὶ τάδε τὸ δικαίωμα αὐτοῦ
πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας ἃς ἐκάθητο Δαυὶδ ἐν ἀγρῷ τῶν ἀλλοφύλων.
**12** Καὶ ἐπιστεύθη Ἄγχους ἐν τῷ Δαυὶδ σφόδρα, λέγων· ἤσχυνται
αἰσχυνόμενος ἐν τῷ λαῷ αὐτοῦ ἐν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἔσται μοι δοῦ-
λος εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα.

**1** ΚΑὶ ἐγένετο ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις, καὶ συναθροίζονται ἀλ-
λόφυλοι ἐν ταῖς παρεμβολαῖς αὐτῶν τοῦ ἐξελθεῖν πολεμεῖν ἐπὶ Ἰσ-
ραήλ. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἄγχους πρὸς Δαυίδ· γινώσκων γνώσῃ, ὅτι μετ᾿
ἐμοῦ ἐξελεύσῃ εἰς τὸν πόλεμον, σύ, καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες σου. Καὶ εἶ-
**2** πε Δαυὶδ πρὸς Ἄγχους· οὕτω νῦν γνώσῃ ἃ ποιήσει ὁ δοῦλός σου. Καὶ
εἶπεν Ἄγχους πρὸς Δαυίδ· οὕτως ἀρχισωματοφύλακα θήσομαί σε πά-
σας τὰς ἡμέρας.
**3** Καὶ Σαμουὴλ ἀπέθανε, καὶ ἐκόψαντο αὐτὸν πᾶς Ἰσ-
ραήλ, καὶ θάπτουσιν αὐτοὶ ἐν Ῥαμὰ ἐν πόλει αὐτοῦ. Καὶ Σαοὺλ πε-
ριεῖλε τοὺς ἐγγαστριμύθους καὶ τοὺς γνώστας ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς.
**4** Καὶ συναθροίζονται ἀλλόφυλοι, καὶ ἔρχονται καὶ παρεμβάλλουσιν εἰς
Σωνάμ. Καὶ συναθροίζει Σαοὺλ πάντα ἄνδρα Ἰσραήλ, καὶ παρεμ-

**7** Now the number of the days wherein David dwelt in the land of the foreigners, [was] days, four months.
**8** And David went up with his men, and they made a raid upon all the Geshurites, and the Girzites, and upon the Amalekites. And behold, the land was inhabited (which [stretched] from Telamsour, [even] from the fortified lands adjoining), and unto the land of Egypt.
**9** And David smote the land, and spared neither man nor woman alive; and he took flocks and herds and asses and camels and apparel, and returned and came unto Achish.
**10** Then said Achish unto David, "Upon whom have ye made a raid this day?" And David said unto Achish, "Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites."
**11** And [David said to himself,] "I spared neither man nor woman alive to bring them into Gath," saying, "Lest they should report to Gath concerning us," saying, "Thus did David, and such was his custom all the days that David dwelt in the land of the foreigners."
**12** And Achish trusted David greatly, saying, "He is utterly shamed among his people in Israel, and he shall be my servant forever."

**1** And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for to go out and fight against Israel. And Achish said unto David, "Thou shalt surely know that thou shalt go out with me to war, thou, and thy men."
**2** And David said unto Achish, "Now shalt thou know what thy servant will do." And Achish said unto David, "Therefore will I make thee keeper of my body-guard all the days [of thy life]."
**3** Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and they buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.
