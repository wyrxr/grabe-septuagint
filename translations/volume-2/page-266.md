ΚΕΦ. ΙΕ΄.
24 Καὶ Σωθενία, καὶ Ἰωσαφάτ, καὶ Ναθαναήλ, καὶ Ἀμασαί, καὶ Ζαχαρίας, καὶ Βαναί, καὶ Ἐλιέζερ οἱ ἱερεῖς σαλπίζοντες ταῖς σάλπιγξιν ἔμπροσθεν τῆς κιβωτοῦ τοῦ Θεοῦ. Καὶ Ἀβδεδδόμ, καὶ Ἰειὴλ πυλωροὶ τῆς κιβωτοῦ τοῦ Θεοῦ.
25 Καὶ ἦν Δαυίδ, καὶ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι Ἰσραήλ, καὶ οἱ χιλίαρχοι οἱ πορευόμενοι, τοῦ ἀναγαγεῖν τὴν κιβωτὸν τῆς διαθήκης Κυρίου ἐξ οἴκου Ἀβδεδδόμ ἐν εὐφροσύνῃ.
26 Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ κατισχῦσαι τὸν Θεὸν τοὺς Λευίτας αἴροντας τὴν κιβωτὸν τῆς διαθήκης Κυρίου, καὶ ἔθυσαν ἑπτὰ μόσχους, καὶ ἑπτὰ κριούς.
27 Καὶ Δαυίδ περιεζωσμένος ἐν στολῇ βυσσίνῃ, καὶ πάντες οἱ Λευῖται αἴροντες τὴν κιβωτὸν διαθήκης Κυρίου, καὶ οἱ ψαλτωδοί, καὶ Χενενίας ὁ ἄρχων τῶν ᾠδῶν τῶν ἀδόντων, καὶ ἐπὶ Δαυίδ στολῇ βυσσίνῃ.
28 Καὶ πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ ἀνάγοντες τὴν κιβωτὸν διαθήκης Κυρίου ἐν σημασίᾳ, καὶ ἐν φωνῇ σωφέρ, καὶ ἐν σάλπιγγι, καὶ ἐν κυμβάλοις, ἀναφωνοῦντες ἐν νάβλαις, καὶ ἐν κινύραις.
29 Καὶ ἐγένετο κιβωτὸς τῆς διαθήκης Κυρίου, καὶ ἦλθεν ἕως πόλεως Δαυίδ· καὶ Μελχόλ ἡ θυγάτηρ Σαοὺλ παρέκυψε διὰ τῆς θυρίδος, καὶ ἴδε τὸν βασιλέα Δαυίδ ὀρχούμενον, καὶ παίζοντα, καὶ ἐξουδένωσεν αὐτὸν ἐν τῇ ψυχῇ αὐτῆς.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΣ΄. ΧVΙ.

1 ΚΑΙ εἰσήνεγκαν τὴν κιβωτὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ ἀπηρείσαντο αὐτήν ἐν μέσῳ τῆς σκηνῆς ἧς ἔπηξεν αὐτῇ Δαυίδ, καὶ προσήνεγκαν ὁλοκαυτώματα, καὶ σωτηρίου ἐναντίον τοῦ Θεοῦ.
2 Καὶ συνετέλεσε Δαυίδ ἀναφέρων ὁλοκαυτώματα, καὶ σωτηρίου, καὶ εὐλόγησεν τὸν λαὸν ἐν ὀνόματι Κυρίου.
3 Καὶ διεμέρισε παντὶ ἀνδρὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἀπὸ ἀνδρὸς, καὶ ἕως γυναικὸς, τῷ ἀνδρὶ ἄρτον ἕνα ἀρτοκοπιακὸν, καὶ ἀμορίτην.
4 Καὶ ἔταξε κατὰ πρόσωπον τῆς κιβωτοῦ διαθήκης Κυρίου ἐκ τῶν Λευιτῶν λειτουργοῦντας, ἀναφωνοῦντας, καὶ ἐξομολογεῖσθαι, καὶ αἰνεῖν τὸν Κύριον Θεὸν Ἰσραήλ.
5 Ἀσὰφ δ᾽ ἡγούμενος, καὶ δεύτερος ὢν αὐτῷ Ζαχαρίας, ὁ Ἰειήλ, Σεμιραμώθ, καὶ Ἰαθιήλ, Ματταθίας, Ἐλιάβ, καὶ Βαναίας, καὶ Ἀβδεδδόμ· καὶ Ἰειὴλ ἐν ἐργάνοις, ἐν νάβλαις καὶ κινύραις, καὶ Ἀσὰφ ἐν κυμβάλοις ἀναφωνῶν·
6 Καὶ Βαναίας, καὶ Ὀζιὴλ οἱ ἱερεῖς ἐν ταῖς σάλπιγξι διαπαντὸς ἐναντίον τῆς κιβωτοῦ τῆς διαθήκης τοῦ Θεοῦ.
7 Ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, τότε ἔταξε Δαυίδ ἐν ἀρχῇ τοῦ αἰνεῖν τὸν
