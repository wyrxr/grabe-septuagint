τοῦ εἶναι ὀφθαλμούς σου ἀνεῳγμένους εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦτον νυκτὸς καὶ ἡμέρας, εἰς
τὸν τόπον ὃν εἶπας, Ἔσται τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐκεῖ, τοῦ εἰσακούειν τῆς
προσευχῆς ἧς ὁ δοῦλός σου προσεύχεται εἰς τὸν τόπον τοῦτον ἡ-
μέρας καὶ νυκτός. Καὶ εἰσακούσῃ τῆς φωνῆς τοῦ δούλου σου καὶ 30
Ἰσραήλ, ἃ ἂν προσεύχωνται εἰς τὸν τόπον τοῦτον· καὶ σὺ εἰσακού-
σῃ ἐν τῷ τόπῳ τῆς κατοικήσεώς σου, ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ· καὶ ποιή-
σεις, καὶ ἵλεως ἔσῃ. Ὅσα ἂν ἁμάρτῃ ἕκαστος τῷ πλησίον αὐ- 31
τοῦ, καὶ ἐὰν λάβῃ ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν ἀρὰν τοῦ ἀράσασθαι αὐτόν, καὶ ἔλ-
θῃ καὶ ἐξαγορεύσῃ κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου σου ἐν τῷ
οἴκῳ τούτῳ, Καὶ σὺ εἰσακούσῃ ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ ποιήσεις, καὶ 32
κρινεῖς τὸν λαόν σου Ἰσραήλ, ἀνυμηθῆναι ἄνομον, δοῦναι τὴν ὁδὸν
αὐτοῦ εἰς κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοῦ δικαιῶσαι δίκαιον, δοῦναι αὐτῷ
κατὰ τὴν δικαιοσύνην αὐτοῦ. Ἐν τῷ πταίσαι τὸν λαόν σου Ἰσ- 33
ραὴλ ἐνώπιον ἐχθρῶν, ἔτι ἁμαρτήσονταί σοι· καὶ ἐπιστρέψουσι πρὸς
σέ, καὶ ἐξομολογήσονται τῷ ὀνόματί σου, καὶ προσεύξονται καὶ δε-
ηθήσονται πρὸς σὲ ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τούτῳ. Καὶ σὺ εἰσακούσῃ ἐκ τοῦ 34
οὐρανοῦ, καὶ ἵλεως ἔσῃ ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις τοῦ λαοῦ σου Ἰσραήλ, καὶ
ἀποστρέψεις αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν γῆν ἣν ἔδωκας τοῖς πατράσιν αὐτῶν.
Ἐν τῷ συσχεθῆναι τὸν οὐρανόν, καὶ μὴ γενέσθαι ὑετόν, ἔτι ἁμαρ- 35
τήσονταί σοι· καὶ προσεύξονται εἰς τὸν τόπον τοῦτον, καὶ ἐξομο-
λογήσονται τῷ ὀνόματί σου , καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν αὐτῶν
ἐπιστρέψουσιν ὅταν ταπεινώσῃς αὐτούς· καὶ εἰσακούσῃ ἐκ τοῦ οὐ- 36
ρανοῦ, καὶ ἵλεως ἔσῃ ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις τοῦ δούλου σου, καὶ τοῦ λα-
οῦ σου Ἰσραήλ· ἔτι δηλώσεις αὐτοῖς τὴν ὁδὸν τὴν ἀγαθὴν πορεύ-
εσθαι ἐν αὐτῇ, καὶ δώσεις ὑετὸν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν σου, ἣν ἔδωκας τῷ
λαῷ σου ἐν κληρονομία. Λιμὸς ἐὰν γένηται ἐν τῇ γῇ, θάνατος 37
ἐὰν γένηται, ὅτι ἔσται ἐμπυρισμός, ἴκτερος, βροῦχος, ἐρυσίβη ἐὰν
γένηται, καὶ ἐκθλίψει αὐτὸν ἐχθρὸς αὐτοῦ ἐν μιᾷ τῶν πόλεων αὐ-
τοῦ· πᾶν συνάντημα, πάντα πόνον· Πᾶσαν προσευχήν, πᾶσαν δέ- 38
ησιν, ἐὰν γένηται παντὶ ἀνθρώπῳ παντὸς λαοῦ σου Ἰσραήλ, ὡς ἂν
γνῶσιν ἕκαστος ἀρχὴν καρδίας αὐτοῦ, καὶ διαπετάσῃ τὰς χεῖρας αὐ-
τοῦ εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦτον· Καὶ σὺ εἰσακούσῃ ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ἐξ 39
ἑτοίμου κατοικητηρίου σου, καὶ ἵλεως ἔσῃ, καὶ ποιήσεις, καὶ δώ-
σεις ἀνδρὶ κατὰ πάσας τὰς ἐξοὺς αὐτοῦ, καθὼς ἂν γνῶς τὴν καρ-
δίαν αὐτοῦ, ὅτι σὺ μονώτατος οἶδας τὴν καρδίαν πάντων υἱῶν ἀν-
θρώπων. Ὅπως φοβῶνταί σε πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας, ἃς αὐτοὶ ζῶσιν 40

### Translation of the Third Book of Kingdoms, Chapter 8

**29** that Thine eyes may be open toward this House night and day, even toward the place of which Thou hast said, 'My Name shall be there'; that Thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which Thy servant shall pray toward this place day and night.

**30** And Thou shalt hearken unto the voice of Thy servant and [of] Israel, whatsoever they shall pray toward this place; yea, Thou shalt hearken in the place of Thy habitation, in the heaven above, and Thou shalt act, and be merciful.

**31** If any man shall sin against his neighbor, and an oath be laid upon him to swear against him, and he come and confess before Thine altar in this House,

**32** Then Thou shalt hearken from heaven, and act, and judge Thy people Israel, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his own head; and to justify the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.

**33** When Thy people Israel be smitten before their enemies, though they shall have sinned against Thee; and shall turn again unto Thee, and confess Thy Name, and pray and make supplication unto Thee in this House,

**34** Then Thou shalt hearken from heaven, and be merciful unto the sins of Thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which Thou gavest unto their fathers.

**35** When the heaven be shut up, and there be no rain, though they shall have sinned against Thee; and they shall pray toward this place, and confess Thy Name, and turn from their sins when Thou shalt humble them,

**36** Then Thou shalt hearken from heaven, and be merciful unto the sins of Thy servant, and of Thy people Israel; and Thou shalt show them the good way wherein they should walk, and send rain upon Thy land, which Thou hast given unto Thy people for an inheritance.

**37** If there be famine in the land, if there be pestilence; for there shall be burning, jaundice, blight, [and] mildew if it come to pass; [or] if his enemy oppress him in any one of his cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness there be;

**38** Then every prayer, every supplication, which shall be made by any man of all Thy people Israel, when each one shall know the root [or] principle of his own heart, and shall spread forth his hands toward this House—

**39** Then Thou shalt hearken from heaven, from Thy prepared habitation, and be merciful, and act, and give unto every man according to all his outgoings, as Thou shalt know his heart; for Thou only knowest the heart of all the sons of men.

**40** That they may fear Thee all the days that they live.
