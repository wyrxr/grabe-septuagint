ΚΕΦ. ΙΕ´. ΙΕ´. ΤΩΝ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ ΙΟΥΔΑ Β´. 789
τῷ πεντεκαιδεκάτῳ ἔτει τῆς βασιλείας Ἀσά. Καὶ ἔθυσαν τῷ Κυ- 11
ρίῳ ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἀπὸ τῶν σκύλων ὧν ἤνεγκαν, μόσχους
ἑπτακοσίους, καὶ πρόβατα, ἑπτὰ χιλιάδας. Καὶ δίηλθον ἐν διαθή- 12
κῃ ζητῆσαι Κύριον Θεὸν τῶν πατέρων αὐτῶν ἐξ ὅλης τῆς καρδίας,
καὶ ἐξ ὅλης τῆς ψυχῆς αὐτῶν· καὶ πᾶς ὃς ἐὰν μὴ ἐκζητήσῃ τὸν 13
Κύριον Θεὸν Ἰσραήλ, ἀποθανεῖται ἀπὸ νεωτέρου ἕως πρεσβυτέρου,
καὶ ἀπὸ ἀνδρὸς ἕως γυναικός. Καὶ ὤμοσαν ἐν τῷ Κυρίῳ ἐν φωνῇ 14
μεγάλῃ, καὶ ἐν σάλπιγγι, καὶ ἐν κερατίναις. Καὶ ηὐφράνθησαν πᾶς 15
Ἰούδα περὶ τοῦ ὅρκου, ὅτι ἐξ ὅλης τῆς ψυχῆς αὐτῶν ὤμοσαν, καὶ
ἐν πάσῃ θελήσει ἐζήτησαν αὐτόν, καὶ εὑρέθη αὐτοῖς, καὶ κατέπαυ-
σεν αὐτοῖς Κύριος κυκλόθεν. Καὶ τὴν Μααχὰ τὴν μητέρα αὐτοῦ 16
μετέστησε τοῦ μὴ εἶναι τῇ Ἀστάρτῃ λειτουργοῦσαν, καὶ κατέκο-
ψε τὸ εἴδωλον, καὶ κατέκαυσεν ἐν χειμάῤῥῳ Κέδρων. Πλὴν τὰ ὑψη- 17
λὰ οὐκ ἐξῆραν, ἔτι ὑπῆρχεν ἐν τῷ Ἰούδα καὶ Ἰσραήλ· ἀλλ᾿ ἡ καρ-
δία Ἀσὰ ἐγένετο πλήρης πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἰσήνεγ- 18
κε τὰ ἅγια Δαυΐδ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰ ἅγια οἴκου Κυρίου
τοῦ Θεοῦ, ἀργύριον καὶ χρυσίον καὶ σκεύη. Καὶ πόλεμος οὐκ ἦν 19
μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἕως τοῦ πέμπτου καὶ τριακοστοῦ ἔτους τῆς βασιλείας Ἀσά.

ΚΕΦ. ΙϚʹ. XVI.

ΚΑΙ ἐν τῷ ὀγδόῳ καὶ τριακοστῷ ἔτει τῆς βασιλείας Ἀσά, 1
ἀνέβη Βασσὰ βασιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ ἐπὶ Ἰούδαν, καὶ ᾠκοδόμησε τὴν
Ῥαμὰ τοῦ μὴ δοῦναι ἔξοδον καὶ εἴσοδον τῷ Ἀσὰ βασιλεῖ Ἰούδα.
Καὶ ἔλαβεν Ἀσὰ χρυσίον καὶ ἀργύριον ἐκ θησαυρῶν οἴκου Κυρίου, 2
καὶ οἴκου τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ ἀπέστειλε πρὸς τὸν υἱὸν τοῦ Ἄδερ
βασιλέως Συρίας τὸν κατοικοῦντα ἐν Δαμασκῷ, λέγων· διάθου 3
διαθήκην ἀναμέσον ἐμοῦ, καὶ ἀναμέσον σοῦ, καὶ ἀναμέσον τοῦ πα-
τρός μου, καὶ ἀναμέσον τοῦ πατρός σου· ἰδοὺ ἀπέσταλκά σοι χρυ-
σίον καὶ ἀργύριον· δεῦρο καὶ διασκέδασον ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ τὸν Βασσὰ βα-
σιλέα Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἀπελθέτω ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ. Καὶ ἤκουσεν υἱὸς Ἄδερ 4
τοῦ βασιλέως Ἀσά, καὶ ἀπέστειλε τοὺς ἄρχοντας τῆς δυνάμεως
αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὰς πόλεις Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐπάταξε τὴν Ἀἰών, καὶ τὴν
Δάν, καὶ τὴν Ἀβελμαΐν, καὶ πάσας τὰς περιχώρους Νεφθαλί. Καὶ 5
ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἀκοῦσαι Βασσά, ἀπέλιπε τοῦ μηκέτι ᾠκοδομεῖν τὴν
Ῥαμά, καὶ κατέπαυσε τὸ ἔργον ἑαυτοῦ. Καὶ Ἀσὰ ὁ βασιλεὺς 6

**Chapter 15**

¹⁰...the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.
¹¹And they sacrificed unto the Lord on that day, from the spoil which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.
¹²And they entered into a covenant to seek the Lord God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul.
¹³And whosoever would not seek the Lord God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.
¹⁴And they swore unto the Lord with a loud voice, and with trumpets, and with cornets.
¹⁵And all Judah rejoiced at the oath; for with all their heart they had sworn, and with all their earnest desire they had sought Him; and He was found of them. And the Lord gave them rest round about.
¹⁶And Maachah his mother, even her did he remove, that she should no longer be a ministress to Ashtarte; and he cut down her idol, and burned it in the brook Kidron.
¹⁷Nevertheless, the high places were not removed; they still existed in Judah and Israel. But the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.
¹⁸And he brought in the consecrated things of David his father, and the consecrated things of the house of the Lord God, silver, and gold, and vessels.
¹⁹And there was no war with him until the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.

**Chapter 16**

¹And in the eight and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
²Then Asa took silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the Lord and of the king's house, and sent to the son of Ader, king of Syria, who dwelt in Damascus, saying,
³"Let there be a covenant between me and you, and between my father and your father. Behold, I have sent you silver and gold. Come, and cause Baasha king of Israel to withdraw from me, that he may depart from me."
⁴And the son of Ader hearkened unto King Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Aion, and Dan, and Abelmain, and all the surrounding regions of Naphtali.
⁵And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he ceased to build Ramah, and let his work cease.
⁶Then Asa the king...
