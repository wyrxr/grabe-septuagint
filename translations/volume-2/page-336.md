¹⁴ καὶ τῶν υἱῶν Ἀσάφ, Ζαχαρίας καὶ Ματθανίας. Καὶ τῶν υἱῶν
Αἰμάν, Ἰεϊὴλ καὶ Σεμεΐ· καὶ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰδιδοὺν Σαμαίας καὶ Ὀζιήλ.
¹⁵ Καὶ συνήγαγον τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτῶν, καὶ ἡγνίσθησαν κατὰ τὴν
ἐντολὴν τοῦ βασιλέως διὰ προστάγματος Κυρίου, καθαρίσαι τὸν
¹⁶ οἶκον Κυρίου. Καὶ εἰσῆλθον οἱ ἱερεῖς ἔσω εἰς τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου ἁγνί-
σαι, καὶ ἐξέβαλαν πᾶσαν τὴν ἀκαθαρσίαν τὴν εὑρεθεῖσαν ἐν τῷ οἴ-
κῳ Κυρίου, καὶ εἰς τὴν αὐλὴν οἴκου Κυρίου· καὶ ἐδέξαντο οἱ Λευῖ-
¹⁷ ται ἐκβαλεῖν εἰς τὸν χειμάῤῥουν Κέδρων ἔξω. Καὶ ἤρξαντο τῇ ἡμέ-
ρᾳ τῇ πρώτῃ νουμηνίᾳ τοῦ μηνὸς τοῦ πρώτου ἁγνίσαι, καὶ τῇ ἡμέ-
ρᾳ τῇ ὀγδόῃ τοῦ μηνὸς εἰσῆλθαν εἰς τὸν ναὸν τοῦ Κυρίου, καὶ ἤγνι-
σαν τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου ἐν ἡμέραις ὀκτώ, καὶ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑκκαιδε-
¹⁸ κάτῃ τοῦ μηνὸς τοῦ πρώτου συνετέλεσαν. Καὶ εἰσῆλθον ἔσω πρὸς
Ἐζεκίαν τὸν βασιλέα, καὶ εἶπαν· ἡγνίσαμεν πάντα τὰ ἐν οἴκῳ Κυ-
ρίου, τὸ θυσιαστήριον τῆς ὁλοκαυτώσεως καὶ τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ, καὶ
¹⁹ τὴν τράπεζαν τῆς προθέσεως καὶ τὰ σκεύη αὐτῆς, καὶ πάντα τὰ
σκευή ἃ ἐμίανεν Ἀχάζ ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐν τῇ βασιλεία αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ
ἀποστασίᾳ ἑαυτοῦ, ἡτοιμάκαμεν καὶ ἡγνίκαμεν, ἰδοὺ ἔστιν ἐναν-
²⁰ τίον τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου Κυρίου. Καὶ ὤρθρισεν Ἐζεκίας ὁ βασιλεύς,
καὶ συνήγαγε τοὺς ἄρχοντας τῆς πόλεως, καὶ ἀνέβη εἰς οἶκον Κυ-
²¹ ρίου. Καὶ ἀνήνεγκε μόσχους ἑπτά, κριοὺς ἑπτά, ἀμνοὺς ἑπτά, χι-
μάρους αἰγῶν ἑπτὰ περὶ ἁμαρτίας, περὶ τῆς βασιλείας, καὶ περὶ
²² τῶν ἁγίων, καὶ περὶ Ἰσραήλ· καὶ εἶπε τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἀαρὼν τοῖς ἱε-
ρεῦσιν ἀναβαίνειν ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον Κυρίου. Καὶ ἔθυσαν τοὺς
μόσχους, καὶ ἐδέξαντο οἱ ἱερεῖς τὸ αἷμα, καὶ προσέχεν ἐπὶ τὸ θυ-
σιαστήριον· καὶ ἔθυσαν τοὺς κριοὺς, καὶ προσέχεν τὸ αἷμα ἐπὶ τὸ
θυσιαστήριον· καὶ ἔθυσαν τοὺς ἀμνοὺς, καὶ περιέχεν τὸ αἷμα ἐπὶ
²³ θυσιαστηρίῳ. Καὶ προσήγαγον τοὺς χιμάρους τοὺς περὶ ἁμαρτίας
ἐναντίον τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ τῆς ἐκκλησίας, καὶ ἐπέθηκαν τὰς χεῖ-
²⁴ ρας ἑαυτῶν ἐπ᾿ αὐτούς· καὶ ἔθυσαν αὐτοὺς οἱ ἱερεῖς, καὶ ἐξιλάσαν-
το τὸ αἷμα αὐτῶν πρὸς τὸ θυσιαστήριον, καὶ ἐξιλάσαντο περὶ παν-
²⁴ τὸς Ἰσραήλ· ὅτι περὶ παντὸς Ἰσραήλ, εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεύς, ἡ ὁλοκαύ-
²⁵ τωσις, καὶ τὰ περὶ ἁμαρτίας. Καὶ ἔστησε τοὺς Λευΐτας ἐν οἴκῳ
Κυρίου ἐν κυμβάλοις, καὶ ἐν νάβλαις, καὶ ἐν κινύραις κατὰ τὴν
ἐντολὴν Δαυὶδ τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ Γὰδ τοῦ ὁρῶντος τῷ βασιλεῖ,
καὶ Νάθαν τοῦ προφήτου, ὅτι δι᾽ ἐντολῆς Κυρίου τὸ πρόσταγμα
²⁶ ἐν χειρὶ τῶν προφητῶν. Καὶ ἔζησαν οἱ Λευῖται ἐν ὀργάνοις Δαυίδ,

### Chapter 29

¹⁴ And of the sons of Asaph: Zacharias and Mattaniah. And of the sons of Heman: Jeiel and Semei. And of the sons of Idithun: Shemaiah and Oziah.

¹⁵ And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves according to the commandment of the king through the ordinance of the Lord, to cleanse the house of the Lord.

¹⁶ And the priests went within into the house of the Lord to sanctify [it], and cast out all the uncleanness that was found in the house of the Lord, and into the court of the house of the Lord; and the Levites received [it] to cast [it] out into the brook Kidron without.

¹⁷ And they began on the first day, the new moon of the first month, to sanctify; and on the eighth day of the month they came into the temple of the Lord, and sanctified the house of the Lord in eight days; and on the sixteenth day of the first month they finished.

¹⁸ And they went within unto Hezekiah the king, and said, "We have sanctified all that is in the house of the Lord: the altar of burnt offering and its vessels, and the table of the shewbread and its vessels, and all the equipment which Ahaz the king defiled in his reign in his apostasy; we have prepared and sanctified [them].

¹⁹ Behold, it is before the altar of the Lord."

²⁰ And Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the leaders of the city, and went up to the house of the Lord.

²¹ And he brought up seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he-goats for sin offerings, for the kingdom, and for the holy [places], and for Israel; and he said unto the sons of Aaron, the priests, to go up upon the altar of the Lord.

²² And they slew the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and paid attention upon the altar; and they slew the rams, and paid attention the blood upon the altar; and they slew the lambs, and contained the blood upon the altar.

²³ And they brought the he-goats for sin offerings before the king and the congregation, and they laid their hands upon them.

²⁴ And the priests slew them, and purified their blood towards the altar, and made atonement for all Israel; because for all Israel, said the king, [was] the burnt offering, and the sin offerings.

²⁵ And he set the Levites in the house of the Lord with cymbals, and with lyres, and with harps, according to the commandment of David the king, and of Gad the king's seer, and of Nathan the prophet; for by the commandment of the Lord was the ordinance in the hand of the prophets.

²⁶ And the Levites lived in the instruments of David,
