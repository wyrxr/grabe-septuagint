496 ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Α΄. ΚΕΦ. Θʹ.
μετ’ αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἰδοὺ πορευσόμεθα, καὶ τί εἰσοίσομεν τῷ ἀνθρώ-
πῳ τοῦ Θεοῦ; ὅτι ἄρτοι ἐκλελοίπασιν ἐκ τῶν ἀγγείων ἡμῶν,
καὶ πλεῖον οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν ἡμῖν, τοῦ εἰσενεγκεῖν τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ τοῦ
8 Θεοῦ τὸ ὑπάρχον ἡμῖν; Καὶ προσέθετο τὸ παιδάριον ἀποκριθῆ-
ναι τῷ Σαούλ, καὶ εἶπεν· ἰδοὺ εὕρηται ἐν τῇ χειρί μου τέταρτον
σίχλου ἀργυρίου, καὶ δώσεις τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ ἀπαγ-
9 γελεῖ ἡμῖν τὴν ὁδὸν ἡμῶν. (Καὶ ἔμπροσθεν ἐν Ἰσραὴλ τάδε ἐλε-
γεν ἕκαστος ἐν τῷ πορεύεσθαι ἐπερωτῆσαι Θεόν· δεῦτε καὶ πο-
ρευθῶμεν πρὸς τὸν βλέποντα· ὅτι τὸν προφήτην ἐκάλει ὁ λαὸς
10 ἔμπροσθεν, ὁ βλέπων.) Καὶ εἶπε Σαοὺλ πρὸς τὸ παιδάριον αὐτοῦ·
ἀγαθὸν τὸ ῥῆμά σου· δεῦρο καὶ πορευθῶμεν. Καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν εἰς
11 τὴν πόλιν οὗ ἦν ἐκεῖ ὁ ἄνθρωπος τοῦ Θεοῦ. Αὐτῶν ἀναβαινόν-
των τὴν ἀνάβασιν τῆς πόλεως, καὶ αὐτοὶ εὑρίσκουσι τὰ κοράσια
ἐξεληλυθότα ὑδρεύσασθαι ὕδωρ, καὶ λέγουσιν αὐταῖς· εἰ ἔστιν ἐν-
12 ταῦθα ὁ βλέπων; Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη τὰ κοράσια αὐτοῖς, καὶ λέγου-
σιν· ἔστιν, ἰδοὺ κατὰ πρόσωπον ὑμῶν· τάχυνον νῦν, ὅτι διὰ τὴν
ἡμέραν ἥκει εἰς τὴν πόλιν, ὅτι θυσία σήμερον τῷ λαῷ ἐν Βα-
13 μᾷ. Ὡς ἂν εἰσέλθητε τὴν πόλιν, οὕτως εὑρήσετε αὐτὸν ἐν τῇ
πόλει, πρὶν ἀναβῆναι αὐτὸν εἰς Βαμᾷ τοῦ φαγεῖν· ὅτι οὐ μὴ
φάγῃ ὁ λαὸς ἕως τοῦ ἐλθεῖν αὐτόν, ὅτι οὗτος εὐλογεῖ τὴν θυ-
σίαν, καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα ἐσθίουσιν οἱ ξένοι· καὶ νῦν ἀνάβητε, ὅτι
14 διὰ τὴν ἡμέραν εὑρήσετε αὐτόν. Καὶ ἀναβαίνουσι τὴν πόλιν αὐ-
τῶν εἰσπορευομένων εἰς μέσον τῆς πόλεως, καὶ ἰδοὺ Σαμουὴλ
15 ἐξῆλθεν εἰς τὴν ἀπάντησιν αὐτῶν, τοῦ ἀναβῆναι εἰς Βαμᾷ. Καὶ
Κύριος ἀπεκάλυψε τὸ ὠτίον Σαμουὴλ ἡμέρᾳ μιᾷ, ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ
16 ἐλθεῖν Σαοὺλ πρὸς αὐτόν, λέγων· ὡς δ’ ὁ καιρὸς οὗτος, αὔ-
ριον (αὔριον) ἀποστελῶ πρὸς σὲ ἄνδρα ἐκ γῆς Βενιαμείν, καὶ
χρίσεις αὐτὸν εἰς ἄρχοντα ἐπὶ τὸν λαόν μου Ἰσραήλ, καὶ
σώσει τὸν λαόν μου ἐκ χειρὸς ἀλλοφύλων· ὅτι ἐπέβλεψα ἐπὶ
τὴν ταπείνωσιν τοῦ λαοῦ μου, ὅτι ἦλθε βοὴ αὐτῶν πρὸς μέ.
17 Καὶ Σαμουὴλ εἶδε τὸν Σαούλ, καὶ Κύριος ἀπεκρίθη αὐτῷ· ἰδοὺ ὁ
18 ἄνθρωπος ὃν εἶπά σοι· οὗτος ἄρξει ἐν τῷ λαῷ μου. Καὶ προσήγαγε
Σαοὺλ πρὸς Σαμουὴλ εἰς μέσον τῆς πόλεως, καὶ εἶπεν· ἀπάγ-
19 γειλον δὴ μοι, ποῖος οἶκος τοῦ βλέποντος. Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Σαμουὴλ
τῷ Σαούλ, καὶ εἶπεν· ἐγώ εἰμι αὐτός· ἀνάβηθι ἔμπροσθέν μου εἰς
Βαμᾷ, καὶ φάγε μετ’ ἐμοῦ σήμερον, καὶ ἐξαποστελῶ σε πρωΐ, καὶ

**Chapter 9**

7
that was with him, "Behold, if we go, what shall we bring unto the man of God? For the bread is spent from out of our vessels, and there is nought else remaining unto us, to bring unto the man of God that which we have?"
8
Then the servant answered Saul once more, and said, "Lo, there is found in my hand a fourth part of a shekel of silver, and this shalt thou give unto the man of God, and he shall declare unto us our way."
9
(Now beforetime in Israel, when any man went to enquire of God, thus would he say: "Come, let us go unto him that seeth"; for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer by the people.)
10
And Saul said unto his servant, "Thy word is good; come, let us go." And they went unto the city where the man of God was.
11
As they went up the ascent of the city, they found young maidens come forth to draw water; and they said unto them, "Is the Seer here?"
12
And the maidens answered them, and said, "He is; behold, he is before your face. Make haste now, for he is come into the city this day, for there is a sacrifice for the people this day in Bamah.
13
As soon as ye enter into the city, so shall ye find him within the city, before he go up to Bamah to eat; for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice, and afterward do the invited ones eat. Now therefore, go ye up, for this day shall ye find him."
14
So they went up to the city; and as they entered into the midst of the city, behold, Samuel came forth to meet them, [intending] to go up to Bamah.
15
Now the Lord had unveiled unto Samuel's ear one day before Saul came unto him, saying,
16
"Even as at this time, tomorrow, yea, tomorrow, shall I send unto thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be a ruler over My people Israel, and he shall save My people from the hand of the Philistines; for I have looked upon the affliction of My people, for their cry hath come unto Me."
17
And when Samuel saw Saul, the Lord answered him, "Behold the man whom I spake of unto thee! This man shall rule over My people."
18
Then Saul drew nigh unto Samuel in the midst of the city, and said, "Tell me, I pray thee, which is the Seer's house."
19
And Samuel answered Saul, and said, "I am he. Go up before me unto Bamah, and eat with me today, and I will send thee away early tomorrow, and
