ΚΕΦ. ΙΕ΄. ΙΩΒ. 907
ἐρήμους, καὶ εἰσέλθοι εἰς οἴκους ἀοικήτους· ἃ δὴ ἐκεῖνος ἡτοίμασεν, ἄλλοι ἀποίσονται· οὔτε μὴ πλουτισθῇ, οὔτε μὴ μείνῃ τὰ 29
ὑπάρχοντα αὐτοῦ· οὐδὲ μὴ βάλῃ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν σκιάν, οὐδὲ μὴ ἐκφύγῃ σκότος· τὸν βλαστὸν αὐτοῦ μαράναι ἄνεμος, καὶ ἐκπέσοι αὐτοῦ τὸ ἄνθος. Μὴ πιστευέτω ὅτι ὑπομενεῖ· κενὰ γὰρ αὐτῷ ἀποθήσεται. Ἡ τομὴ αὐτοῦ πρὸ ὥρας φθαρήσεται, καὶ ὁ ῥάδαμνος 32
αὐτοῦ οὐ μὴ πυκάσῃ· τρυγηθείη δὲ ὥσπερ ὄμφαξ πρὸ ὥρας, καὶ 33
ἐκπέσοι ὥσπερ ἄνθος ἐλαίας. Μαρτύριον γὰρ ἀσεβοῦς θάνατος, 34
πῦρ δὲ κατακαύσει οἴκους δωροδεκτῶν· καὶ ἐν γαστρὶ λήψεται ὀδύνας, ἀποθήσεται δὲ αὐτῷ κενά, ἡ δὲ κοιλία αὐτοῦ ὑποίσει δόλον.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΕ΄. XVI.

ΥΠΟΛΑΒΩΝ δὲ Ἰώβ, λέγει· ἀκήκοα τοιαῦτα πολλά· παρακλήτορες κακῶν πάντες ὑμεῖς. Τί γάρ; μὴ τάξις ἐστὶ ῥήμασι 3
πνεύματος; ἢ τί παρενοχλήσει σοι ὅτι ἀποκρίνῃ; Καὶ ἐγὼ δὲ καθ᾿ 4
ὑμᾶς λαλήσω· εἴγε ὑπέκειτο ἡ ψυχὴ ὑμῶν ἀντὶ τῆς ἐμῆς ψυχῆς,
εἴτ᾿ ἐναλοῦμαι ὑμῖν λόγοις, κινήσω δὲ καθ᾿ ὑμῶν κεφαλήν· εἴη δὲ 5
ἰσχὺς ἐν τῷ στόματί μου, καὶ κίνησιν χειλέων μου οὐ φείσομαι.
Ἐὰν γὰρ λαλήσω, οὐκ ἀλγήσω τὸ τραῦμά μου· ἐὰν δὲ σιωπήσω, 6
τί ἔλαττον τρωθήσομαι; Νῦν δὲ κατακόπον με πεποίηκε, μωρόν, 7
σεσηπότα, καὶ ἐπελάβου μου· εἰς μαρτύριον ἐγενήθη, καὶ ἀνέστη 8
ἐν ἐμοὶ τὸ ψεῦδός μου, κατὰ πρόσωπόν μου ἀνταπεκρίθη. Ὀργῇ 9.10
χρησάμενος κατέβαλλέ με, ἔβρυξε (δὲ) ἐπ᾿ ἐμὲ τοὺς ὀδόντας αὐτοῦ·
βέλη πειρατηρίων αὐτοῦ ἐπ᾿ ἐμοὶ ἔπεσεν. Ἀχίσιν ὀφθαλμῶν ἐνήλατό μοι, ὀξεῖ ἔπαισέ με εἰς σιαγόνα· ὁμοθυμαδὸν δὲ κατέδραμον
ἐπ᾿ ἐμέ. Παρέδωκε γάρ με ὁ Κύριος εἰς χεῖρας ἀδίκου, ἐπὶ δὲ ἀσεβεῖς ἔρριψέ με· εἰρηνεύοντα διεσκέδασέ με, λαβών με τῆς κόμης 12
διέτιλε. Κατέτησέ με ὥσπερ σκοπόν· ἐκύκλωσάν με λόγχαις βάλλοντες εἰς νεφροὺς μου, οὐ φειδόμενοι· ἐξέχεαν εἰς γῆν τὴν χολήν
μου. Κατέβαλόν με πτώμα ἐπὶ πτώματι· ἔδραμον ἐπ᾿ ἐμὲ δυνατοί. Σάκκον ἐξέῤῥαψα ἐπὶ βύρση μου· τὸ δὲ σθένος μου εἰς γῆν ἔσβέσθη· ἡ γαστήρ μου συγκέκαυται ἀπὸ κλαυθμοῦ, ἐπὶ δὲ βλεφάρων 16
μου σκιὰ θανάτου. Ἄδικον γὰρ οὐδὲν ἦν ἐν χερσί μου· εὐχὴ δέ μου 17
καθαρά. Γῆ μὴ ἐπικαλύψῃς ἐφ᾿ αἵματι σαρκός μου, μηδὲ εἴη τόπος τῇ κραυγῇ μου. Καὶ νῦν ἰδοὺ ἐν οὐρανοῖς ὁ μάρτυς μου, ὁ δὲ 19

**28** desolate, and he shall enter into houses uninhabited; what things he did prepare, others shall carry away;
**29** neither shall he be enriched, nor shall his possessions remain.
**30** Neither shall he cast a shadow upon the earth, nor shall he escape darkness; the wind shall cause his sprout to wither, and his flower shall fall off.
**31** Let him not trust that he shall endure; for vain things shall be laid up for him.
**32** His cutting shall perish before its time, and his branch shall not grow thick.
**33** He shall be reaped as an unripe grape before its time, and shall fall off as an olive flower.
**34** For the witness of the ungodly is death, and fire shall consume the houses of those who take bribes.
**35** And in his belly shall he receive pains; and vain things shall be laid up for him, and his belly shall bring forth deceit.

## CHAPTER XVI.

**1** Then Job answered and said,
**2** I have heard many such things: ye are all miserable comforters.
**3** What then? Shall there be no end to words of wind? Or what troubleth thee that thou dost answer?
**4** I also could speak as ye do; if your soul were in the stead of my soul,
**5** then would I heap up words against you, and shake my head at you. Oh that there were strength in my mouth, and that I would not spare the moving of my lips!
**6** For if I speak, my grief is not assuaged; and if I forbear, what am I eased?
**7** But now hath He worn me out, and made me weary, and rendered me foolish, yea, even corrupted; and you have laid hold upon me.
**8** It hath become a witness [against me], and my falsehood hath risen up within me; it hath answered against me to my face.
**9** He hath torn me in His wrath, and cast me down; He hath gnashed upon me with His teeth; the arrows of His trials are fallen upon me.
**10** With sharp glances of His eyes He hath leapt upon me, with a sharp [blow] He hath smitten me upon the jaw; and with one accord they have run upon me.
**11** For the Lord hath delivered me into the hands of the unrighteous, and hath cast me upon the ungodly.
**12** Being at peace, He hath scattered me; He hath taken me by my hair, and torn [it] out.
**13** He hath caused me to waste away as a target; they have compassed me about with spears, shooting into my kidneys, and sparing not; they have poured out my gall upon the earth.
**14** They have cast me down, fall upon fall; mighty ones have run upon me.
**15** I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin; and my strength is extinguished in the dust.
**16** My belly is consumed by weeping, and upon my eyelids is the shadow of death.
**17** For there was no unrighteousness in my hands; and my prayer is pure.
**18** O Earth, cover not thou the blood of my flesh, neither let there be a resting place for my cry.
**19** Even now, behold, my Witness is in the heavens, and my Confidant [is] on high;
