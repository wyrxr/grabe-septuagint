ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Γ΄. ΚΕΦ. ΙϚ΄.
28 Καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Ἄμβρι μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ, καὶ θάπτεται ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ· καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Ἀχαὰβ ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ.
29 Ὁ δὲ Ἀχαὰβ υἱὸς Ἄμβρι ἐβασίλευσεν ἐπὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐν ἔτει τριακοστῷ καὶ ὀγδόῳ τοῦ Ἀσὰ βασιλέως Ἰούδα· βασιλεύσας δὲ Ἀχαὰβ υἱὸς Ἄμβρι ἐπὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ εἴκοσι καὶ δύο ἔτη.
30 Καὶ ἐποίησεν Ἀχαὰβ υἱὸς Ἄμβρι τὸ πονηρὸν ἐνώπιον Κυρίου ὑπὲρ πάντας τοὺς ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ.
31 Καὶ οὐκ ἦν αὐτῷ ἱκανὸν πορεύεσθαι ἐν ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις Ἱεροβοὰμ υἱοῦ Ναβάτ, καὶ ἔλαβε γυναῖκα τὴν Ἰεζάβελ, θυγατέρα Ἰεθεβαὰλ βασιλέως Σιδωνίων· καὶ ἐπορεύθη, καὶ ἐδούλευσε τῷ Βαάλ, καὶ προσεκύνησεν αὐτῷ.
32 Καὶ ἔστησε θυσιαστήριον τῷ Βαὰλ ἐν οἴκῳ τῶν προσοχθισμάτων αὐτοῦ, ὃν ᾠκοδόμησεν ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ.
33 Καὶ ἐποίησεν Ἀχαὰβ ἄλσος· καὶ προσέθηκεν Ἀχαὰβ τοῦ ποιῆσαι τοῦ παροργίσαι τὸν Κύριον Θεὸν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ τοῦ ἐξολοθρευθῆναι· ἐκακοποίησεν ὑπὲρ πάντας τοὺς βασιλεῖς Ἰσραὴλ τοὺς γενομένους ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ.
34 Ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις αὐτοῦ ᾠκοδόμησεν Ἀχιὴλ ὁ Βαιθηλίτης τὴν Ἰεριχώ, ἐν τῷ Ἀβειρὼν τῷ πρωτοτόκῳ αὐτοῦ ἐθεμελίωσεν αὐτήν, καὶ τῷ Σεγοὺβ τῷ νεωτέρῳ αὐτοῦ ἐπέστησε θύρας αὐτῆς κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα Κυρίου, ὃ ἐλάλησεν ἐν χειρὶ Ἰησοῦ υἱοῦ Ναυῆ.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΖ΄. XVII.

1 ΚΑΙ εἶπεν Ἠλιοὺ ὁ προφήτης Θεσβίτης ὁ ἐκ Θεσβῶν τῆς Γαλαὰδ πρὸς Ἀχαάβ· Ζῇ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τῶν δυνάμεων, ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ, ᾧ παρέστην ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ, εἰ ἔσται τὰ ἔτη ταῦτα δρόσος καὶ ὑετός, ὅτι εἰ μὴ διὰ στόματος λόγου μου.
2 Καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς Ἠλιού·
3 πορεύου ἐντεῦθεν κατ᾿ ἀνατολάς, καὶ κρύβηθι ἐν τῷ χειμάρρῳ Χορράθ τοῦ ἐπὶ προσώπου τοῦ Ἰορδάνου.
4 Καὶ ἔσται ἐκ τοῦ χειμάρρου πίεσαι ὕδωρ, καὶ τοῖς κόραξιν ἐντελοῦμαι διατρέφειν σε ἐκεῖ.
5 Καὶ ἐπορεύθη, καὶ ἐποίησε κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα Κυρίου, καὶ ἐκάθισεν ἐν τῷ χειμάρρῳ Χορράθ ἐπὶ πρόσωπον τοῦ Ἰορδάνου.
6 Καὶ οἱ κόρακες ἔφερον αὐτῷ ἄρτους καὶ κρέας τὸ πρωί, καὶ ἄρτον καὶ κρέας τὸ δείλης, καὶ ἐκ τοῦ χειμάρρου ἔπινεν ὕδωρ.
7 Καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ ἡμέρας, καὶ ἐξηράνθη ὁ χειμάρρους, ὅτι οὐκ ἐγένετο ὑετὸς ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς.
8 Καὶ ἐγένετο ῥῆμα

### Kings III, Chapter 16 (Cont.)

**28** And Ambri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria; and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.

**29** Now Ahab the son of Ambri began to reign over Israel in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah; and Ahab the son of Ambri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.

**30** And Ahab the son of Ambri did evil in the sight of the Lord, above all that were before him.

**31** And it was not enough for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, but he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians; and he went and served Baal, and worshipped him.

**32** And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of his abominations, which he had built in Samaria.

**33** And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab added [yet more] to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger, and his soul to be utterly destroyed; he did wickedly above all the kings of Israel who were before him.

**34** In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho; he laid the foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof in Segub his youngest, according to the word of the Lord, which He spake by the hand of Joshua the son of Nun.

### Kings III, Chapter 17

**1** And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of Tisbe in Gilead, said unto Ahab, "As the Lord God of hosts liveth, the God of Israel, before whom I stand, there shall not be in these years dew nor rain, but according to the word of my mouth."

**2** And the word of the Lord came unto Elijah, saying,

**3** "Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.

**4** And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there."

**5** So he went and did according unto the word of the Lord; for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.

**6** And the ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning, and bread and meat in the evening; and he drank water from the brook.

**7** And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there was no rain in the land.

**8** And the word...
