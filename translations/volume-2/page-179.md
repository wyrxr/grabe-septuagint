ΚΕΦ. ΚΒʹ. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Γʹ.
ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ ἐπάξω τὴν κακίαν ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΒʹ. XXII.

1 ΚΑὶ ἐκάθισε τρία ἔτη, καὶ οὐκ ἦν πόλεμος ἀναμέσον Συρίας, καὶ ἀναμέσον Ἰσραήλ.
2 Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἐνιαυτῷ τῷ τρίτῳ, καὶ κατέβη Ἰωσαφὰτ βασιλεὺς Ἰούδα πρὸς βασιλέα Ἰσραήλ.
3 Καὶ εἶπε βασιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς τοὺς παῖδας αὐτοῦ· εἰ οἴδατε ὅτι ἡμῖν Ῥεμμὰθ Γαλαάδ, καὶ ἡμεῖς σιωπῶμεν λαβεῖν αὐτὴν ἐκ χειρὸς βασιλέως Συρίας;
4 Καὶ εἶπε βασιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς Ἰωσαφάτ· εἰ ἀναβήσῃ μεθ᾿ ἡμῶν εἰς πόλεμον Ῥεμμὰθ Γαλαάδ; Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰωσαφὰτ πρὸς βασιλέα Ἰσραήλ· καθὼς ἐγώ, καὶ σὺ οὕτως· καθὼς ὁ λαός μου, ὁ λαός σου· καθὼς οἱ ἵπποι μου, οἱ ἵπποι σου.
5 Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰωσαφὰτ βασιλεὺς Ἰούδα πρὸς βασιλέα Ἰσραήλ· ἐπερωτήσατε δὴ σήμερον τὸν Κύριον.
6 Καὶ συνήθροισεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ πάντας τοὺς προφήτας ὥστε τετρακοσίους ἄνδρας, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς ὁ βασιλεύς· εἰ πορευθῶ εἰς Ῥεμμὰθ Γαλαὰδ εἰς πόλεμον, ἢ ἐπισχῶ; καὶ εἶπαν· ἀνάβαινε, ὅτι διδούς δώσει Κύριος εἰς χεῖρας τοῦ βασιλέως.
7 Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰωσαφὰτ πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Ἰσραήλ· Ἄρα οὐκ ἔστιν ὧδε προφήτης τοῦ Κυρίου οὐκ ἔτι, καὶ ἐπερωτήσομεν τὸν Κύριον δι᾿ αὐτοῦ;
8 Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς Ἰωσαφάτ· ἔτι ἐστιν ἀνὴρ εἷς τὸ ἐπερωτῆσαι τὸν Κύριον δι᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐγὼ μεμίσηκα αὐτόν, ὅτι οὐ λαλεῖ περὶ ἐμοῦ καλά, ἀλλ᾿ ἢ κακά, Μιχαίας υἱὸς Ἰεμλᾶ· καὶ εἶπεν Ἰωσαφὰτ βασιλεὺς Ἰούδα· μὴ λεγέτω ὁ βασιλεὺς οὕτως.
9 Καὶ ἐκάλεσεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ εὐνοῦχον ἕνα, καὶ εἶπε· τοτάχος Μιχαίαν υἱὸν Ἰεμλᾶ.
10 Καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ Ἰωσαφὰτ βασιλεὺς Ἰούδα ἐκάθηντο ἀνὴρ ἐπὶ τοῦ θρόνου αὐτοῦ ἔνοπλοι ἐν ταῖς πόλεσι Σαμαρείας· καὶ πάντες οἱ προφῆται ἐπροφήτευον ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν.
11 Καὶ ἐποίησεν αὐτῷ Σεδεκίας υἱὸς Χαναὰ κέρατα σιδηρᾶ, καὶ εἶπε· τάδε λέγει Κύριος· ἐν τούτοις κερατιεῖς τὴν Συρίαν ἕως συντελεσθῇ.
12 Καὶ πάντες οἱ προφῆται προεφήτευον οὕτως, λέγοντες· ἀνάβαινε εἰς Ῥεμμὰθ Γαλαάδ, καὶ εὐοδώσει, καὶ δώσει Κύριος εἰς χεῖράς σου τὸν βασιλέα.
13 Καὶ ὁ ἄγγελος ὁ πορευθεὶς καλέσαι τὸν Μιχαίαν, ἐλάλησεν αὐτῷ, λέγων· Ἰδοὺ δὴ λαλοῦσι πάντες οἱ προ-

**Chapter 21**
**(continued from verse 29)**
"...in his days, and in the days of his son will I bring the evil upon his house.

**Chapter 22**

**1** Now they continued three years, and there was no war betwixt Syria and betwixt Israel.
**2** And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went down to the king of Israel.
**3** And the king of Israel said unto his servants, "Know ye not that Ramoth-Gilead is ours? And we do keep silence [and fail] to take it out of the hand of the king of Syria?"
**4** And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, "Wilt thou go up with me to battle against Ramoth-Gilead?" And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, "As I am, so art thou; and my people, even as thy people; and my horses, even as thy horses."
**5** And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah said unto the king of Israel, "Inquire, I pray thee, this day of the Lord."
**6** Then the king of Israel gathered all the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, "Shall I go against Ramoth-Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?" And they said, "Go up; for the Lord shall surely deliver [it] into the hand of the king."
**7** And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, "Is there not here a prophet of the Lord besides, that we might inquire of the Lord by him?"
**8** And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, "There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the Lord: Micaiah the son of Imlah; but I hate him, for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but only evil." And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah said, "Let not the king say so."
**9** And the king of Israel called one of his eunuchs, and said, "Bring speedily Micaiah the son of Imlah!"
**10** Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, arrayed in their armor, in the city of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.
**11** And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said, "Thus saith the Lord: With these shalt thou gore Syria, until they be utterly consumed."
**12** And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, "Go up to Ramoth-Gilead, and prosper; for the Lord shall deliver the king into thine hand."
**13** And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, "Behold now, the words of all the pro-
