574 ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Β΄. ΚΕΦ. ΙΕ΄.
τοὺς ἀδελφούς σου μετὰ σοῦ, καὶ Κύριος ποιήσει μετὰ σοῦ ἔλεος
21 καὶ ἀλήθειαν. Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Ἐθεεὶ τῷ βασιλεῖ, καὶ εἶπε· Ζῇ Κύ-
ριος, καὶ ζῇ ὁ κύριός μου ὁ βασιλεύς, ὅτι εἰς τὸν τόπον οὗ ἂν ᾖ
ὁ κύριός μου ὁ βασιλεύς, καὶ ἐὰν εἰς θάνατον, καὶ ἐὰν εἰς ζωὴν
22 ὅτι ἐκεῖ ἔσται ὁ δοῦλός σου. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς πρὸς Ἐθεεὶ·
δεῦρο, καὶ διάβαινε μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ. Καὶ παρῆλθεν Ἐθεεὶ ὁ Γεθθαῖος,
23 καὶ πάντες οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ, καὶ πᾶς ὁ ὄχλος ὁ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ
πᾶσα ἡ γῆ ἔκλαιε φωνῇ μεγάλῃ. Καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς παρεπορεύον-
το, καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς παρερχόμενος ἐν τῷ χειμάρρῳ (τῶν) Κέδρων·
καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς παρεπορεύοντο ἐπὶ πρόσωπον ὁδοῦ τὴν ἔρημον.
24 Καὶ ἰδοὺ καὶ γε Σαδὼκ, καὶ πάντες οἱ Λευῖται μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, αἴ-
ροντες τὴν κιβωτὸν διαθήκης Κυρίου ἀπὸ Βαιθάρ. Καὶ ἔστησαν
τὴν κιβωτὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ. Καὶ ἀνέβη Ἀβιαθὰρ ἕως ἐπαύσατο πᾶς ὁ
25 λαὸς παρελθεῖν ἐκ τῆς πόλεως. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τῷ Σαδ-
δὼκ· ἀπόστρεψον τὴν κιβωτὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ εἰς τὴν πόλιν, καὶ κα-
θισάτω εἰς τὸν τόπον αὐτοῦ· ἐὰν εὕρω χάριν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς Κυ-
ρίου, καὶ ἐπιστρέψει με, καὶ δείξει μοι αὐτὴν καὶ τὴν εὐπρέπειαν
26 αὐτῆς. Καὶ ἐὰν εἴπῃ οὕτως· οὐχ ἠθέληκα ἐν σοί· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ εἴ-
27 μι, ποιείτω μοι κατὰ τὸ ἀγαθὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπεν
ὁ βασιλεὺς τῷ Σαδὼκ τῷ ἱερεῖ· ἴδετε, σὺ ἐπιστρέφεις εἰς τὴν
πόλιν ἐν εἰρήνῃ, καὶ Ἀχιμὰας ὁ υἱός σου, καὶ Ἰωνάθαν ὁ υἱὸς
28 Ἀβιαθὰρ, οἱ δύο υἱοὶ ὑμῶν μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν. Ἴδετε, ἐγὼ εἰμι, στρατεύομαι
ἐν Ἀραβὼθ τῆς ἐρήμου, ἕως τοῦ ἐλθεῖν ῥῆμα παρ᾿ ὑμῶν τοῦ
29 ἀπαγγεῖλαί μοι. Καὶ ἀπέστρεψε Σαδὼκ καὶ Ἀβιαθὰρ τὴν κι-
30 βωτὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἐκάθισεν ἐκεῖ. Καὶ Δαυὶδ
ἀνέβαινεν ἐν τῇ ἀναβάσει τῶν ἐλαιῶν ἀναβαίνων καὶ κλαίων, καὶ
τὴν κεφαλὴν ἐπικεκαλυμμένος, καὶ αὐτὸς ἐπορεύετο ἀνυπόδετος.
Καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ὁ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἐπεκάλυψεν ἀνὴρ τὴν κεφαλὴν αὑ-
31 τοῦ· καὶ ἀνέβαινον ἀναβαίνοντες καὶ κλαίοντες. Καὶ Δαυὶδ ἀνήγ-
γελθη, λέγοντες· Ἀχιτόφελ ἐν τοῖς συστρεφομένοις μετὰ Ἀβεσ-
σαλώμ. Καὶ εἶπε Δαυὶδ· διασκέδασον δὴ τὴν βουλὴν Ἀχιτόφελ,
32 Κύριε ὁ Θεός μου. Καὶ ἦν Δαυὶδ εἰσερχόμενος ἕως τοῦ Ῥὼς ,
οὗ προσεκύνησεν ἐκεῖ τῷ Θεῷ. Καὶ ἰδοὺ εἰς ἀπάντησιν αὐτοῦ Χου-
σεὶ ὁ ἀρχιεταῖρος Δαυὶδ, διερρηγὼς τὸν χιτῶνα αὐτοῦ, καὶ γῆ
33 ἐπὶ τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Δαυὶδ· ἐὰν διαβῇς μετ᾿
34 ἐμοῦ, καὶ ἔσῃ ἐπ᾿ ἐμὲ εἰς βάσταγμα. Καὶ ἐὰν εἰς τὴν πόλιν

**21** And Ittai answered the king, and said, "As the Lord liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in whatsoever place my lord the king shall be, whether it be unto death, or whether it be unto life, then there shall thy servant be."

**23** And the whole land wept with a great voice. And all the people passed over; and the king passed over in the brook (of the) Kidron. And all the people passed along toward the desert way.
**24** And behold, even Zadok, and all the Levites with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of the Lord from Bethar. And they set down the ark of God. And Abiathar went up, until all the people had ceased to pass forth from the city.
**25** And the king said unto Zadok, "Carry back the ark of God into the city, and let it abide in its place. If I shall find grace in the eyes of the Lord, then He will bring me again, and will show me both it and its comeliness.

**31** And it was told unto David, saying, "Ahithophel is among them that conspire with Absalom." And David said, "O Lord my God, I pray Thee, scatter Thou the counsel of Ahithophel."
