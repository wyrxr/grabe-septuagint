πολλά, καὶ ἀποσκευὴν, καὶ σκῦλα, καὶ σκεύη ἐπιθυμητὰ, καὶ ἐπώ-
λευσαν ἑαυτοῖς. Καὶ ἐγένοντο ἡμέραι τρεῖς σκυλευόντων αὐτῶν
τὰ σκῦλα, ὅτι πολλὰ ἦν. Καὶ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τετάρτῃ ἐπισυνήχθη- 26
σαν εἰς τὸν αὐλῶνα τῆς εὐλογίας, ἐκεῖ γὰρ ηὐλόγησαν τὸν Κύριον·
διὰ τοῦτο ἐκάλεσαν τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ τόπου ἐκείνου, Κοιλὰς εὐλογίας,
ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης. Καὶ ἐπέστρεψε πᾶς ἀνὴρ Ἰούδα εἰς Ἱε- 27
ρουσαλὴμ, καὶ Ἰωσαφὰτ ἡγούμενος αὐτῶν ἐν εὐφροσύνῃ μεγάλῃ,
ὅτι ηὔφρανεν αὐτοὺς Κύριος ἀπὸ τῶν ἐχθρῶν αὐτῶν. Καὶ εἰσῆλ- 28
θον εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐν νάβλαις, καὶ κινύραις, καὶ ἐν σάλπιγξιν
εἰς οἶκον Κυρίου. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἔκστασις Κυρίου ἐπὶ πάσας τὰς 29
βασιλείας τῆς γῆς, ἐν τῷ ἀκοῦσαι αὐτοὺς ὅτι ἐπολέμησε Κύριος
πρὸς τοὺς ὑπεναντίους Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ εἰρήνευσεν ἡ βασιλεία Ἰω- 30
σαφάτ, καὶ κατέπαυσεν αὐτῷ ὁ Θεὸς αὐτοῦ κυκλόθεν. Καὶ ἐβασί- 31
λευσεν Ἰωσαφὰτ ἐπὶ τὸν Ἰούδαν, ὢν ἐτῶν τριακονταπέντε ἐν τῷ
βασιλεῦσαι αὐτὸν, καὶ εἴκοσι καὶ πέντε ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ἱερου-
σαλὴμ, καὶ ὄνομα τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ Ἀζουβὰ, θυγάτηρ Σαλαί. Καὶ 32
ἐπορεύθη ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ Ἀσὰ, καὶ οὐκ ἐξέκλινε
τοῦ ποιῆσαι τὸ εὐθὲς ἐνώπιον Κυρίου· ἀλλὰ τὰ ὑψηλὰ ἔτι ὑπῆρ- 33
χε, καὶ ἔτι ὁ λαὸς οὐ κατεύθυνε τὴν καρδίαν αὐτῶν πρὸς Κύριον
Θεὸν τῶν πατέρων ἑαυτῶν. Καὶ οἱ λοιποὶ λόγοι Ἰωσαφάτ, οἱ πρῶ- 34
τοι καὶ οἱ ἔσχατοι, ἰδοὺ γεγραμμένοι ἐν λόγοις Ἰηοῦ τοῦ Ἀνανὶ,
ὃς κατέγραψε βιβλίον βασιλέων Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα ἐκοινώ- 35
νησεν Ἰωσαφὰτ βασιλεὺς Ἰούδα πρὸς Ὀχοζίαν βασιλέα Ἰσραὴλ,
καὶ οὗτος ἠνόμησεν, ἐν τῷ ποιῆσαι καὶ πορευθῆναι πρὸς αὐτὸν, 36
τοῦ ποιῆσαι πλοῖα τοῦ πορευθῆναι εἰς Θαρσεῖς. Καὶ ἐποίησε πλοῖα
ἐν Γασιὼν Γαβέρ. Καὶ ἐπροφήτευσεν Ἐλιέζερ ὁ τοῦ Δωδία ἀπὸ 37
Μαρισῆς ἐπὶ Ἰωσαφὰτ, λέγων· ὡς ἐφιλίασας τῷ Ὀχοζίᾳ, ἔθραυσε
Κύριος τὸ ἔργον σου, καὶ συνετρίβη τὰ πλοῖά σου· καὶ οὐκ ἐδυνά-
σθη τοῦ πορευθῆναι εἰς Θαρσεῖς.

²⁵ ...much livestock, and baggage, and spoil, and desirable vessels; and they made these spoil for themselves. And it came to pass that they were three days gathering the spoil, for it was exceeding much.

²⁶ And on the fourth day, they assembled themselves in the Valley of Blessing; for there they blessed the Lord: therefore the name of that place was called, The Valley of Blessing, even unto this day.

²⁷ Then every man of Judah and Jerusalem returned, and Jehoshaphat at their head, with great joy; for the Lord had made them to rejoice over their enemies.

²⁸ And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries, and with harps, and with trumpets, unto the house of the Lord.

²⁹ And the terror of the Lord came upon all the kingdoms of the earth, when they heard that the Lord had fought against the adversaries of Israel.

³⁰ So the kingdom of Jehoshaphat was at peace; for his God gave him rest round about.

³¹ And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Azubah, the daughter of Salai.

³² And he walked in the ways of Asa his father, and departed not from doing that which was right in the sight of the Lord.

³³ Nevertheless, the high places were not taken away: for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the Lord God of their fathers.

³⁴ Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are written in the records of Jehu the son of Hanani, who recorded a book of the kings of Israel.

³⁵ And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly, in that he did and went to him,

³⁶ to make ships to go to Tarshish. And he made ships in Ezion-geber.

³⁷ Then Eliezer the son of Dodiah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, "Because thou hast allied thyself with Ahaziah, the Lord hath broken thy work, and thy ships are shattered; and they were not able to go to Tarshish."

### CHAPTER XXI

¹ And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.

² And he had brethren, the sons of Jehoshaphat, six: Azariah, and Jeiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Mi[chael]...
