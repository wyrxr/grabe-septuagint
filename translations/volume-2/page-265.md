ΚΕΦ. ΙΕ΄.
τα Ἰσραὴλ εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ τοῦ ἀνενεγκεῖν τὴν κιβωτὸν Κυρίου εἰς τὸν τόπον ὅν ἡτοίμασεν αὐτῇ.
Καὶ συνήγαγε Δαυὶδ τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἀαρών, καὶ τοὺς Λευΐτας.
Τῶν υἱῶν Καάθ· Οὐριὴλ ὁ ἄρχων, καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ, ἑκατὸν εἴκοσι.
Τῶν υἱῶν Μεραρί· Ἀσαΐας ὁ ἄρχων, καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ, διακόσιοι καὶ εἴκοσι.
Τῶν υἱῶν Γηρσών· Ἰωὴλ ὁ ἄρχων, καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ, ἑκατὸν καὶ τριάκοντα.
Τῶν υἱῶν Ἐλισαφάν· Σεμαΐα ὁ ἄρχων, καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ, διακόσιοι.
Τῶν υἱῶν Χεβρών· Ἐλιὴλ ὁ ἄρχων, καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ, ὀγδοήκοντα.
Τῶν υἱῶν Ὀζιήλ· Ἀμιναδὰβ ὁ ἄρχων, καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ, ἑκατὸν δεκαδύο.
Καὶ ἐκάλεσε Δαυὶδ τὸν Σαδὼκ καὶ Ἀβιάθαρ τοὺς ἱερεῖς, καὶ τοὺς Λευΐτας, τὸν Οὐριήλ, Ἀσαΐαν, καὶ Ἰωήλ, καὶ Σεμαΐαν, καὶ Ἐλιήλ, καὶ Ἀμιναδάβ, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· ὑμεῖς ἄρχοντες πατριῶν τῶν Λευϊτῶν, ἁγνίσθητε ὑμεῖς καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ ὑμῶν, καὶ ἀνοίσετε τὴν κιβωτὸν τοῦ Κυρίου Θεοῦ Ἰσραήλ, οὐ ἡτοίμασα αὐτῇ.
Ὅτι οὐκ ἐν τῷ πρότερον ὑμᾶς εἶναι, διέκοψεν ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν ἐν ἡμῖν, ὅτι οὐκ ἐζητήσαμεν ἐν κρίματι.
Καὶ ἡγνίσθησαν οἱ ἱερεῖς καὶ οἱ Λευῖται, τοῦ ἀνενεγκεῖν τὴν κιβωτὸν τοῦ Κυρίου Θεοῦ Ἰσραήλ.
Καὶ ἔλαβον οἱ υἱοὶ τῶν Λευϊτῶν τὴν κιβωτὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ, ὡς ἐνετείλατο Μωσῆς ἐν λόγῳ Θεοῦ κατὰ τὴν γραφὴν ἐν ἀναφορεῦσιν ἐφ’ ἑαυτοῦς.
Καὶ εἶπε Δαυὶδ τοῖς ἄρχουσι τῶν Λευϊτῶν· στήσατε τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτῶν τοὺς ψαλτῳδοὺς ἐν ὀργάνοις ᾠδῶν, νάβλαις, καὶ κινύραις, καὶ κυμβάλοις, τοῦ φωνῆσαι εἰς ὕψος ἐν φωνῇ εὐφροσύνης.
Καὶ ἔστησαν οἱ Λευῖται τὸν Αἰμὰν υἱὸν Ἰωήλ· ἐκ τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτοῦ Ἀσὰφ υἱὸς Βαραχία· καὶ ἐκ τῶν υἱῶν Μεραρὶ ἀδελφῶν αὐτοῦ Αἰθὰν υἱὸς Κισαίου.
Καὶ μετ’ αὐτῶν οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτῶν, οἱ δεύτεροι, Ζαχαρίας, καὶ Ὀζιήλ, καὶ Σεμιραμώθ, καὶ Ἰειήλ, καὶ Ἀνανί, καὶ Ἐλιάβ, καὶ Βαναία, καὶ Μαασία, καὶ Ματταθίας, καὶ Ἐλιφαλά, καὶ Μακενία, καὶ Ἀβδεδδόμ, καὶ Ἰειήλ, καὶ Ὀζίας, οἱ πυλωροί.
Καὶ οἱ ψαλτῳδοί, Αἰμάν, Ἀσάφ, καὶ Αἰθάν, ἐν κυμβάλοις χαλκοῖς τοῦ ἀκουσθῆναι ποιῆσαι. Ζαχαρίας, καὶ Ὀζιήλ, Σεμιραμώθ, Ἰειήλ, καὶ Ἀνανί, καὶ Ἐλιάβ, καὶ Μαασίας, Βαναίας, ἐν νάβλαις ἐπὶ ἀλημώθ· καὶ Ματταθίας, καὶ Ἐλιφαλαίας, καὶ Μακενίας, καὶ Ἀβδεδδόμ, καὶ Ἰειήλ, καὶ Ὀζίας ἐν κινύραις ἀμασενειθ τοῦ ἐνισχύσαι· καὶ Χωνενία ἄρχων τῶν Λευϊτῶν ἄρχων τῶν ᾠδῶν, ὅτι συνετὸς ἦν.
Καὶ Βαραχία, καὶ Ἡλκανὰ πυλωροὶ τῆς κιβωτοῦ.

**3** Israel unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the Lord unto the place which he had prepared for it.
**4** And David gathered the sons of Aaron, and the Levites.
**5** Of the sons of Kohath: Uriel the chief, and his brethren, an hundred and twenty.
**6** Of the sons of Merari: Asaiah the chief, and his brethren, two hundred and twenty.

**11** And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites: Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, and Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab.
**12** And he said unto them, "Ye are the chiefs of the fathers' houses of the Levites; sanctify yourselves, ye and your brethren, and bring up the ark of the Lord God of Israel unto the place which I have prepared for it."
**13** "For because ye were not [present] at the first, our God made a breach among us, because we sought Him not according to the ordinance."
**14** So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves, to bring up the ark of the Lord God of Israel.
**15** And the sons of the Levites took the ark of God, as Moses commanded by the word of God, according to the writing, upon [their] shoulders with carrying poles.
**16** And David spake unto the chiefs of the Levites, "Appoint ye their brethren the singers with instruments of song, with psalteries, and with harps, and with cymbals, to lift up their voice aloud with a voice of joy."
**17** And the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah;
**18** And of the sons of Merari, of his brethren, Ethan the son of Kishi.
**19** And with them their brethren, of the second rank: Zechariah, and Uzziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Anani, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Eliphalah, and Mikneiah, and Obed-Edom, and Jehiel, and Uzziah, the doorkeepers.
**20** And the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were with cymbals of brass, to make a sound to be heard.
**21** Zechariah, and Uzziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, and Anani, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, were with psalteries upon Alamoth;
**22** And Mattithiah, and Eliphalaias, and Mikneiah, and Obed-Edom, and Jehiel, and Uzziah, were with harps upon Sheminith, to lead [the song] with strength.
**23** And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was chief of the songs, for he was skillful.
**24** And Berechiah, and Elkanah, were doorkeepers for the ark.
