`8` τολὰς μου, καὶ τὰ κρίματά μου· ὡς ἡ ἡμέρα αὕτη· καὶ νῦν κατὰ πρόσωπον πάσης ἐκκλησίας Κυρίου, καὶ ἐν ὠσὶ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν, φυλάσσεσθε καὶ ζητήσατε πάσας τὰς ἐντολὰς Κυρίου Θεοῦ ὑμῶν, ἵνα κληρονομήσητε τὴν γῆν τὴν ἀγαθήν, καὶ κατακληρονομήσητε τοῖς υἱοῖς ὑμῶν μεθ᾽ ὑμᾶς ἕως αἰῶνος. Καὶ νῦν Σαλωμὼν υἱέ μου,
`9` γνῶθι τὸν Θεὸν τῶν πατέρων σου, καὶ δούλευε αὐτῷ ἐν καρδίᾳ τελείᾳ, καὶ ψυχῇ θελούσῃ, ὅτι πάσας καρδίας ἐξετάζει Κύριος, καὶ πᾶν ἐνθύμημα γινώσκει. ἐὰν ζητήσῃς αὐτόν, εὑρεθήσεταί σοι· καὶ ἐὰν καταλείψῃς αὐτόν, καταλείψει σε εἰς τέλος.
`10` Ἴδε νῦν, ὅτι Κύριος ἡρέτικέ σε οἰκοδομῆσαι αὐτῷ οἶκον εἰς ἁγίασμα, ἴσχυε καὶ ποίει.
`11` Καὶ ἔδωκε Δαυΐδ Σαλωμὼν τῷ υἱῷ αὐτοῦ τὸ παράδειγμα τοῦ ναοῦ, καὶ τῶν οἴκων αὐτοῦ, καὶ Ζαχχὼ αὐτοῦ, καὶ τῶν ὑπερῴων, καὶ τῶν ἀποθηκῶν τῶν ἐσωτέρων, καὶ τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ ἐξιλασμοῦ.
`12` Καὶ τὸ παράδειγμα δ᾽ εἶχεν ἐν πνεύματι αὐτοῦ, τῶν αὐλῶν οἴκου Κυρίου, καὶ πάντων τῶν παστοφορίων τῶν κύκλῳ τῶν εἰς τὰς ἀποθήκας οἴκου Κυρίου, καὶ τῶν ἀποθηκῶν τῶν ἀγίων,
`13` Καὶ τῶν καταλυμάτων τῶν ἐφημεριῶν τῶν ἱερέων, καὶ τῶν Λευιτῶν εἰς πᾶσαν ἐργασίαν λειτουργίας οἴκου Κυρίου, καὶ τῶν ἀποθηκῶν τῶν λειτουργησίμων, σκευῶν τῆς λατρείας οἴκου Κυρίου.
`14` Καὶ τὸν σταθμὸν τῆς ὅλκης αὐτῶν τῶν τε χρυσῶν καὶ
`15` ἀργυρῶν, λυχνιῶν τὴν ὅλκην ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ, καὶ τῶν λύχνων.
`16` Ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ ὁμοίως τὸν σταθμὸν τῶν τραπεζῶν τῆς προθέσεως,
`17` ἑκάστης τραπέζης χρυσῆς, καὶ ὡσαύτως τῶν ἀργυρῶν. Καὶ τῶν κρεαγρῶν, καὶ σπονδείων, καὶ τῶν φιαλῶν τῶν χρυσῶν· καὶ τὸν σταθμὸν τῶν χρυσῶν καὶ τῶν ἀργυρῶν, κεφφουρέ, ἑκάστου σταθμοῦ.
`18` Καὶ τὸν τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου τῶν θυμιαμάτων ἐκ χρυσίου δοκίμου σταθμὸν ὑπέδειξεν αὐτῷ, καὶ τὸ παράδειγμα τοῦ ἅρματος τῶν Χερουβεὶμ τῶν διαπεπετασμένων ταῖς πτέρυξι, καὶ σκιαζόντων ἐπὶ τῆς κιβωτοῦ διαθήκης Κυρίου.
`19` Πάντα ἐν γραφῇ χειρὸς Κυρίου ἔδωκε Δαυΐδ Σαλωμών, κατὰ τὴν περιγενηθεῖσαν αὐτῷ σύνεσιν τῆς κατεργασίας τοῦ παραδείγματος.
`20` Καὶ εἶπε Δαυΐδ Σαλωμὼν τῷ υἱῷ αὐτοῦ· Ἴσχυε, καὶ ἀνδρίζου, καὶ ποίει, μὴ φοβοῦ μηδὲ πτοηθῆς, ὅτι Κύριος ὁ Θεός μου μετὰ σοῦ, οὐκ ἀνήσει σε, οὐδ᾽ οὐ μή σε ἐγκαταλείψῃ ἕως τοῦ συντελέσαι σε πᾶσαν ἐργασίαν λειτουργίας οἴκου Κυρίου. καὶ ἰδοὺ τὸ παράδειγμα τοῦ ναοῦ, καὶ τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ, καὶ Ζαχχὼ αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰ ὑπερῷα, καὶ τὰς ἀποθύρας

`8` ...[these] commandments, and My judgments, as on this day.
    And now, by these same precepts,
    and by My judgments, even as on this day,
    before the face of all the congregation of the Lord,
    and in the ears of our God,
    keep ye and seek ye all the commandments of the Lord your God,
    that ye may inherit the good land,
    and may cause it to be inherited by your sons after you, forever.
`9` And now, Solomon my son,
    know thou the God of thy fathers,
    and serve Him with a perfect heart and with a willing soul.
    For the Lord searcheth all hearts,
    and knoweth every imagination [of the thoughts].
    If thou seek Him, He shall be found of thee;
    but if thou forsake Him, He will cast thee off forever.
`10` See now, for the Lord hath chosen thee
    to build Him a house for a sanctuary:
    Be strong and do it.
`11` And David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the Temple,
    and of its houses, and its Zacchō,
    and of the upper chambers,
    and of the inner storehouses,
    and of the house of atonement.
`12` And the pattern he had by the Spirit,
    of the courts of the House of the Lord,
    and of all the chambers round about,
    for the storehouses of the House of the Lord,
    and of the storehouses of the holy things.
`13` And of the lodgings for the courses of the priests and of the Levites,
    for all the work of the service of the House of the Lord,
    and of the storehouses for the things of ministry,
    even the vessels of the service of the House of the Lord.
`14` And the weight for the full measure of these things,
    both of gold and of silver:
`15` [the weight] of the silver,
    the full measure of the lampstands gave he him,
    and of the lamps.
`16` Likewise, he gave him the weight of the tables of the showbread,
`17` of each table of gold, and likewise of the silver [tables];
    and of the fleshhooks, and of the libation bowls,
    and of the golden bowls;
    and the weight of the gold and of the silver,
    [even of the] Kephphoure, of each [respective] weight.
`18` And he showed him the weight of the altar of incense,
    [made] of refined gold,
    and the pattern of the chariot of the Cherubim,
    which spread out their wings,
    and overshadowed the ark of the covenant of the Lord.
`19` All these things, in writing by the hand of the Lord,
    David gave unto Solomon,
    according to the understanding that was bestowed upon him
    for the execution of the pattern.
`20` And David said unto Solomon his son:
    "Be strong, and play the man, and do it.
    Fear not, neither be dismayed,
    for the Lord my God is with thee.
    He will not fail thee, neither will He forsake thee,
    until thou hast finished all the work
    for the service of the House of the Lord.
    And behold, [here is] the pattern of the Temple,
    and of its house, and its Zacchō,
    and the upper chambers, and the inner gates."
