ΚΕΦ. Ι΄. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Δ΄. 681
Σαμαρεία, ἕως τοῦ ἀφανίσαι αὐτὸν κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα Κυρίου, ὃ ἐλά-
λησε πρὸς Ἠλιού. Καὶ συνήθροισεν Ἰηοῦ πάντα τὸν λαόν, καὶ εἶ- 18
πε πρὸς αὐτούς. Ἀχαάβ ἐδούλευσε τῷ Βάαλ ὀλίγα, Ἰηοῦ δουλεύ-
σει αὐτῷ πολλά. Καὶ νῦν πάντες οἱ προφῆται τοῦ Βάαλ, πάντας 19
τοὺς δούλους αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοὺς ἱερεῖς αὐτοῦ καλέσατε πρὸς μέ, ἀ-
νὴρ μὴ ἐπισκεπήτῳ, ὅτι θυσία μεγάλη μοι τῷ Βάαλ· πᾶς ὃς ἂν
ἐπισκεπῇ, οὐ ζήσεται· καὶ Ἰηοῦ ἐποίησεν ἐν πτερνισμῷ, ἵνα ἀπο-
λέσῃ τοὺς δούλους τοῦ Βάαλ. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰηοῦ· ἁγιάσατε ἱερείαν 20
τῷ Βάαλ. καὶ ἐκήρυξαν· Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ἰηοῦ ἐν παντὶ Ἰσραήλ· 21
καὶ ἦλθον πάντες οἱ δοῦλοι τοῦ Βάαλ· οὐ κατελείφθη ἀνὴρ ὃς οὐ
παρεγένετο. Καὶ εἰσῆλθον εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Βάαλ· καὶ ἐπλήσθη ὁ
οἶκος τοῦ Βάαλ στόμα εἰς στόμα. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰηοῦ τοῖς ἐπὶ τοῦ 22
Μισθαάλ· ἐξαγάγετε ἔνδυμα ἅπασι τοῖς δούλοις τοῦ Βάαλ. καὶ
ἐξήνεγκεν αὐτοῖς ὁ στολιστής. Καὶ εἰσῆλθεν Ἰηοῦ, καὶ Ἰωναδὰβ 23
υἱὸς Ῥηχὰβ εἰς οἶκον τοῦ Βάαλ, καὶ εἶπε τοῖς δούλοις τοῦ Βάαλ·
ἐρευνήσατε καὶ ἴδετε, εἰ ἔστι μεθ᾽ ὑμῶν τῶν δούλων Κυρίου, ὅτι
ἀλλ᾽ ἢ οἱ δοῦλοι τοῦ Βάαλ μονώτατοι. Καὶ εἰσῆλθε τοῦ ποιῆσαι 24
τὰ θυμιάματα, καὶ τὰ ὁλοκαυτώματα· καὶ Ἰηοῦ ἔταξεν ἑαυτῷ ἔξω
ὀγδοήκοντα ἄνδρας, καὶ εἶπεν· ἀνὴρ ὃς ἂν διασωθῇ ἀπὸ τῶν ἀν-
δρῶν ὧν ἐγὼ ἀνάγω ἐπὶ χεῖρας ὑμῶν, ἡ ψυχὴ αὐτοῦ ἀντὶ τῆς
ψυχῆς αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς συνετέλεσε ποιῶν τὴν ὁλοκαύτωσιν, 25
καὶ εἶπεν Ἰηοῦ τοῖς παρατρέχουσι, καὶ τοῖς τριστάταις· εἰσελθόν-
τες πατάξατε αὐτούς, ἀνὴρ μὴ ἐξελθέτω ἐξ αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐπάτα-
ξαν αὐτοὺς ἐν στόματι ῥομφαίας, καὶ ἔῤῥιψαν οἱ παρατρέχοντες,
καὶ οἱ τριστάται. Καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν ἕως πόλεως οἴκου τοῦ Βάαλ.
Καὶ ἐξήνεγκαν τὴν στήλην οἴκου τοῦ Βάαλ, καὶ ἐνέπρησαν αὐτήν. 26
Καὶ κατέσπασαν τὰς στήλας τοῦ Βάαλ, καὶ καθεῖλον τὸν οἶκον τοῦ 27
Βάαλ, καὶ ἔταξαν αὐτὸν εἰς λυτρῶνας ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης. Καὶ 28
ἠφάνισεν Ἰηοῦ τὸν Βάαλ ἐξ Ἰσραήλ. Πλὴν τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν Ἱερο- 29
βοὰμ υἱοῦ Ναβὰτ ὃς ἐξήμαρτε τὸν Ἰσραήλ, οὐκ ἀπέστη Ἰηοῦ ἀπὸ
ὀπίσω αὐτῶν· αἱ δαμάλεις αἱ χρυσαῖ αἱ ἐν Βαιθήλ, καὶ ἐν Δάν.
Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Ἰηοῦ· ἀνθ᾽ ὧν ὅσα ἠγάθυνας ποιῆσαι τὸ 30
εὐθὲς ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς μου, κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ μου ἐποίη-
σας τῷ οἴκῳ Ἀχαάβ, υἱοὶ τέταρτοι καθήσονται σοι ἐπὶ θρόνου Ἰ-
σραήλ. Καὶ Ἰηοῦ οὐκ ἐφύλαξε πορεύεσθαι ἐν νόμῳ Κυρίου Θεοῦ 31
Ἰσραὴλ ἐν ὅλῃ καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ· οὐκ ἀπέστη ἀπάνωθεν ἁμαρτιῶν

**17** Samaria, until he had utterly destroyed him, according to the word of the LORD, which He spake by Elijah.

**18** Then Jehu gathered all the people and said unto them, "Ahab served Baal but little; Jehu shall serve him much more."

**19** "Now therefore, call ye unto me all the prophets of Baal, and all his servants, and all his priests; let no man be missing, for a great sacrifice have I to Baal. Whosoever shall be missing shall not live." And Jehu did this with a crafty purpose, that he might destroy the servants of Baal.

**20** And Jehu said, "Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal." And they proclaimed it.

**21** And Jehu sent throughout all Israel, and all the servants of Baal came; there was not a man left who came not. And they came into the house of Baal, and the house of Baal was filled from wall to wall.

**22** And Jehu said unto those who were over the Vestry, "Bring forth vestments for all the servants of Baal." And the vestment-keeper brought them forth unto them.

**23** And Jehu went in, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab with him, into the house of Baal; and he said unto the servants of Baal, "Search ye and see whether there be with you any of the servants of the LORD, that none may be here but the servants of Baal only."

**24** And they went in to offer the sacrifices and the burnt offerings. Now Jehu had appointed eighty men for himself outside, and said, "If any man shall suffer to escape one of the men whom I bring into your hands, his life shall be forfeit for the life of him [that escapeth]."

**25** And it came to pass, when he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guards and to the captains, "Go in and smite them; let no man come forth from among them." And they smote them with the edge of the sword, and the guards and the captains cast them down. And they went unto the city of the house of Baal.

**26** And they brought forth the pillar from the house of Baal, and burned it.

**27** And they pulled down the pillars of Baal, and pulled down the house of Baal, and made it a latrine unto this day.

**28** Thus Jehu utterly destroyed Baal out of Israel.

**29** Nevertheless, from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, Jehu turned not away from following them: [even] the golden calves that were in Bethel, and that were in Dan.

**30** And the LORD said unto Jehu, "Because thou hast done well in doing that which is right in My sight, and hast done according to all that was in My heart concerning the house of Ahab, thy sons unto the fourth generation shall sit upon the throne of Israel."

**31** But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of Israel with all his heart; for he turned not away from the sins of Jeroboam, who made Israel to sin.
