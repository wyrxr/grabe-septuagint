αὐτοῦ εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ· καὶ ἔλαβεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τὰς δέκα γυναῖκας
τὰς παλλακίδας αὐτοῦ ἃς ἀφῆκε φυλάσσειν τὸν οἶκον, καὶ ἔδωκεν
αὐτὰς ἐν οἴκῳ φυλακῆς· καὶ διέθρεψεν αὐτὰς, καὶ πρὸς αὐτὰς οὐκ
εἰσῆλθε· καὶ ἦσαν συνηγούμεναι ἕως ἡμέρας θανάτου αὐτῶν, χῆραι ζῶ-
4 σαι. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς πρὸς Ἀμεσαΐ· βόησόν μοι τὸν ἄνδρα Ἰούδα
5 τρεῖς ἡμέρας, σὺ δὲ αὐτοῦ στῆθι. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη Ἀμεσαΐ τοῦ βοῆσαι
6 τὸν Ἰούδαν, καὶ ἐχρόνησεν ἀπὸ τοῦ καιροῦ οὗ ἐτάξατο αὐτῷ. Καὶ
εἶπε Δαυὶδ πρὸς Ἀβισαεί· νῦν κακοποιήσει ὑμᾶς Σαβεὲ υἱὸς Βο-
χορεί ὑπὲρ Ἀβεσσαλώμ. Καὶ νῦν λάβε τοὺς παῖδας τοῦ κυρίου
σου, καὶ καταδίωξον ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ, μήποτε εὕρῃ αὐτῷ πόλεις ὀχυρὰς,
καὶ σκιάσει τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς ἡμῶν. Καὶ ἐξῆλθον ὀπίσω
αὐτοῦ (καὶ) οἱ ἄνδρες Ἰωάβ, καὶ ὁ Χερεθεὶ, καὶ ὁ Φελεθεὶ,

Ἰωὰβ περιεζωσμένος μανδύαν τὸ ἔνδυμα αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ
περιεζωσμένος μάχαιραν ἐζευγμένην ἐπὶ τῆς ὀσφύος αὐτοῦ, ἐν κολεῷ
αὐτῆς. Καὶ ἡ μάχαιρα ἐξῆλθε, καὶ ἔπεσε. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰωὰβ
τῷ Ἀμεσαεί· εἰ ὑγιαίνεις σὺ, ἀδελφέ μου, Ἀμεσαεί; καὶ ἐκρά-
τησεν ἡ χεὶρ ἡ δεξιὰ Ἰωὰβ τοῦ πώγωνος Ἀμεσαΐ τοῦ καταφι-
10 λῆσαι αὐτόν. Καὶ Ἀμεσαΐ οὐκ ἐφυλάξατο τὴν μάχαιραν τὴν ἐν τῇ
χειρὶ Ἰωάβ· καὶ ἔπαισεν αὐτὸν ἐν αὐτῇ Ἰωὰβ ἐπὶ τὴν ψόαν, καὶ
ἐξεχύθη ἡ κοιλία αὐτοῦ εἰς τὴν γῆν, καὶ οὐκ ἐδευτέρωσεν αὐτῷ,
καὶ ἀπέθανε. Καὶ Ἰωὰβ καὶ Ἀβισαεὶ ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ ἐδίωξεν

αὐτὸν ἱμάτιον, καθ᾿ ὅτι εἶδε πάντα τὸν ἐρχόμενον ἐπὶ αὐτὸν ἐστηκότα.

**CHAPTER 20**

**3** And when David came unto his house in Jerusalem, the King took the ten women, his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and he placed them in a house of confinement; and he nourished them, but he went not in unto them. And they were kept gathered until the day of their death, [being] living widows.

**4** Then said the King unto Amasa, 'Summon for me the men of Judah within three days, and do thou thyself stand there.'

**5** So Amasa went to summon Judah, but he lingered beyond the appointed time.

**6** And David said unto Abishai, 'Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more mischief than Absalom. Take thou now the servants of thy lord, and pursue after him, lest he find for himself fortified cities, and overshadow our eyes.'

**7** So there went forth after him [namely], the men of Joab, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men; and they went forth out of Jerusalem to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.

**8** And they were by the great stone which is in Gibeon; and Amasa came before them. Now Joab was girded with a cloak, his garment, and upon it he was girded with a sword fastened upon his loins in its sheath.

**9** And the sword came forth and fell. Then said Joab unto Amasa, 'Art thou in health, my brother, Amasa?' And the right hand of Joab took Amasa by the beard to kiss him.

**10** But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand; and Joab smote him therewith upon the loin, and his bowels were shed forth upon the ground, and he struck him not a second time, and he died. Then Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.

**11** And a certain man of Joab's young men stood over him, and said, 'Whosoever is for Joab, and whosoever is for David, let him follow Joab!'

**12** And Amasa lay wallowing in blood in the midst of the highway. And the man saw that all the people stood still; and he removed Amasa out of the highway into a field; and cast a garment upon him, because he saw that every man that came upon him stood still.

**13** And when he was removed from the highway, all the men of Israel passed on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.

**14** And he passed through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and unto Bethmaachah; and all in Charrei assembled themselves, and came after him.

**15** And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, and cast up a mound against the city, and
