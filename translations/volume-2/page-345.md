    ΚΕΦ. ΛΓʹ. ΤΩΝ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ ΙΟΥΔΑ Βʹ. 821
    ἤγαγον εἰς Βαβυλῶνα. Καὶ ὡς ἐθλίβη, ἐζήτησε τὸ πρόσωπον Κυ- 12
    ρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐταπεινώθη σφόδρα ἀπὸ προσώπου τοῦ
    Θεοῦ πατέρων ἑαυτοῦ· καὶ προσηύξατο πρὸς αὐτόν, καὶ ἐπήκουσεν 13
    αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπήκουσε τῆς βοῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν αὐτὸν εἰς Ἱε-
    ρουσαλὴμ ἐπὶ τὴν βασιλείαν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔγνω Μανασσῆ, ὅτι Κύ-
    ριος αὐτός ἐστιν ὁ Θεός. Καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα ᾠκοδόμησε τεῖχος ἔξω 14
    τῆς πόλεως Δαυὶδ ἀπὸ λιβὸς κατὰ νότον ἐν τῷ χειμάῤῥῳ, καὶ κατὰ
    τὴν εἴσοδον τὴν διὰ τῆς πύλης τῆς ἰχθυϊκῆς, καὶ περιεκύκλωσε τὸ
    ἄδυτον, καὶ πορευομένων τὴν πύλην τὴν κυκλόθεν, καὶ εἰς αὐτὸ
    Ὀφλᾷ, καὶ ὕψωσε σφόδρα, καὶ κατέστησεν ἄρχοντας τῆς δυνάμεως
    ἐν πάσαις ταῖς πόλεσι ταῖς τειχήρεσιν ἐν Ἰούδᾳ. Καὶ περιεῖλε τοὺς 15
    θεοὺς τοὺς ἀλλοτρίους καὶ τὸ γλυπτὸν ἐξ οἴκου Κυρίου, καὶ πάν-
    τα τὰ θυσιαστήρια, ἃ ᾠκοδόμησεν ἐν ὄρει οἴκου Κυρίου, καὶ ἐν Ἱε-
    ρουσαλήμ, καὶ ἔξω τῆς πόλεως· καὶ κατώρθωσε τὸ θυσιαστήριον 16
    Κυρίου, καὶ ἐθυσίασεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸ θυσίαν σωτηρίου καὶ αἰνέσεως· καὶ
    εἶπε τῷ Ἰούδᾳ, τοῦ δουλεύειν Κυρίῳ Θεῷ Ἰσραήλ. Πλὴν ὁ λαὸς 17
    ἔτι ἐπὶ τῶν ὑψηλῶν ἐθυσίαζε, πλὴν Κυρίῳ Θεῷ αὐτῶν. Καὶ τὰ 18
    λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Μανασσῆ, καὶ ἡ προσευχὴ αὐτοῦ ἡ πρὸς τὸν
    Θεόν, καὶ οἱ λόγοι τῶν ὁρώντων τῶν λαλούντων πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐπ᾿
    ὀνόματι Κυρίου Θεοῦ Ἰσραήλ, ἰδοὺ ἐπὶ λόγων προσευχῆς αὐτοῦ, 19
    καὶ ὡς ὑπήκουσεν αὐτοῦ. καὶ πᾶσαι αἱ ἁμαρτίαι αὐτοῦ, καὶ αἱ ἀπο-
    στασίαι αὐτοῦ, καὶ οἱ τόποι ἐφ᾿ οἷς ᾠκοδόμησεν ἐν αὐτοῖς τὰ ὑψη-
    λά, καὶ ἔστησεν ἐκεῖ ἄλση καὶ γλυπτά, πρὸ τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι, ἰδοὺ
    γέγραπται ἐπὶ λόγων τῶν ὁρώντων. Καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Μανασσῆς μετὰ 20
    τῶν πατέρων ἑαυτοῦ, καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν ἐν παραδείσῳ οἴκου αὐτοῦ.
    Καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ Ἀμὼν υἱὸς αὐτοῦ. Ὄν ἐτῶν εἴκοσι 21
    καὶ δύο Ἀμὼν ἐν τῷ βασιλεύειν αὐτόν, καὶ δύο ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν
    Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ πονηρὸν ἐνώπιον Κυρίου, ὡς ἐποίη- 22
    σε Μανασσῆς ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ· καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς εἰδώλοις οἷς ἐποίησεν
    ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ Μανασσῆς, ἔθυεν Ἀμὼν καὶ ἐδούλευεν αὐτοῖς· καὶ 23
    οὐκ ἐταπεινώθη ἐναντίον Κυρίου, ὡς ἐταπεινώθη Μανασσῆς ὁ πα-
    τὴρ αὐτοῦ, ὅτι υἱὸς αὐτοῦ Ἀμὼν ἐπλήθυνε πλημμέλειαν. Καὶ 24
    ἐπέθεντο αὐτῷ οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπάταξαν αὐτὸν ἐν οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ.
    Καὶ ἐπάταξεν ὁ λαὸς τῆς γῆς τοὺς ἐπιτιθεμένους ἐπὶ τὸν βασιλέα 25
    Ἀμών, καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν ὁ λαὸς τῆς γῆς τὸν Ἰωσίαν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ
    ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ.

    **Chapter 33**

    ¹¹...[brought him] to Babylon.
    ¹² And when he was afflicted, he sought the face of the LORD his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers;
    ¹³ and he prayed unto Him, and He heard him, yea, He heard his cry, and brought him again to Jerusalem, unto his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD Himself is God.
    ¹⁴ Now after this, he built a wall without the city of David, on the southwest side, southward by the torrent, and at the entrance through the Fish Gate; and he encompassed the citadel, and the gate of those going round about, and [extending] into Ophel; and he raised it up exceedingly high; and he set captains of the host in all the fortified cities in Judah.
    ¹⁵ And he took away the foreign gods, and the graven image out of the house of the LORD, and all the altars which he had built on the mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and without the city.
    ¹⁶ And he restored the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon sacrifices of peace offerings and of thanksgiving; and he commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel.
    ¹⁷ Nevertheless the people sacrificed still in the high places, yet only unto the LORD their God.
    ¹⁸ Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers who spake to him in the Name of the LORD God of Israel,
    ¹⁹ behold, they are upon the words of his prayer, and how [the Lord] harkened unto him. And all his sins, and his backslidings, and the places wherein he built high places for them, and set up Asherah poles and graven images there, before he turned back; behold, these are written in the words of the seers.
    ²⁰ And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the garden of his own house. And Amon his son reigned in his stead.
    ²¹ Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.
    ²² And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as Manasseh his father had done: for Amon sacrificed unto all the idols which Manasseh his father had made, and served them.
    ²³ And he humbled not himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; for Amon his son greatly multiplied trespass.
    ²⁴ And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own house.
    ²⁵ And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against King Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.
