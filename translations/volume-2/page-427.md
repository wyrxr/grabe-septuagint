24 ταὶ σοι εἰρήνη· ἡσυχάσεις γάρ, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ὁ πολεμῶν σε· μετα-
25 βαλόμενοι δὲ πολλοὶ σου δεηθήσονται. ᾿Οφθαλμοὶ δὲ ἀσεβῶν τα-
26 κήσονται, καὶ σωτηρία αὐτοὺς ἀπολείψει· ἡ γὰρ ἐλπὶς αὐτῶν ἀπώ-
27 λεια ψυχῆς. (᾿Οφθαλμοὶ δὲ ἀσεβῶν τακήσονται· παρ᾿ αὐτῷ γὰρ σο-
28 φία καὶ δύναμις.)

**ΚΕΦ. ΙΒ´. ΧΙΙ.**

1 ὙΠΟΛΑΒΩΝ δὲ ᾿Ιώβ, λέγει· εἶτα ὑμεῖς ἐστε ἄνθρωποι μό-
2 νοι; ἢ μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν τελευτήσει σοφία; Καὶ ἐμοὶ μὲν καρδία καθ᾿
3 ὑμᾶς ἐστι. Δίκαιος γὰρ ἀνὴρ καὶ ἄμεμπτος ἐγενήθη εἰς χλευα-
4 σμόν· εἰς χρόνον γὰρ τακτὸν ἡτοίμαστο πεσεῖν (με) ὑπ᾿ ἄλλοις,
5 οἴκους τε αὐτοῦ ἐκπορθεῖσθαι ὑπὸ ἀνόμων. Οὐ μὴν δὲ ἀλλὰ μη-
6 δεὶς πεποιθέτω, πονηρὸς ὤν, ἀθῶος ἔσεσθαι, ὅσοι παροργίζουσι
7 τὸν Κύριον, ὡς οὐχὶ καὶ ἔτασις αὐτῶν ἔσται. ᾿Αλλὰ δὴ ἐπερωτή-
8 σον τετράποδα, ἐάν σοι εἴπῃ, πετεινά τε οὐρανοῦ, ἐάν σοι ἀναγ-
9 γείλῃ· ἐκδιηγήσῃ δὲ γῆ, ἐάν σοι φράσῃ, καὶ (εἰ) ἐξηγήσονται σοι
10 οἱ ἰχθύες τῆς θαλάσσης. (῞Οτι) τίς οὐκ ἔγνω ἐν πᾶσι τούτοις,
11 ὅτι χεὶρ Κυρίου ἐποίησε ταῦτα; ῞Οτι ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ ψυχὴ πάν-
12 των τῶν ζώντων, καὶ πνεῦμα πάσης σαρκὸς ἀνθρώπου. Οὓς μὲν
13 γὰρ ῥήματα διακρίνει, λάρυγξ δὲ σῖτα γεύεται ἑαυτῷ. ᾿Εν πολ-
14 λῷ χρόνῳ σοφία εὑρίσκεται· ἐν δὲ μακρῷ βίῳ ἐπιστήμη. Παρ᾿ αὐ-
15 τῷ σοφία καὶ δύναμις, (παρ) αὐτῷ βουλὴ καὶ σύνεσις. ᾿Εὰν κατα-
16 βάλῃ, τίς οἰκοδομήσει; ἐὰν δὲ καὶ ἀποκλείσῃ κατὰ ἀνθρώπου, τίς
17 ἀνοίξει; ᾿Εὰν κωλύσῃ τὸ ὕδωρ, ξηρανεῖ τὴν γῆν ἐὰν δὲ (καὶ) ἐπα-
18 φῇ, ἀπώλεσεν αὐτὴν καταστρέψας. Παρ᾿ αὐτῷ κράτος καὶ ἰσχύς·
19 (παρ᾿) αὐτῷ ἐπιστήμη καὶ σύνεσις. Διάγων βουλευτὰς (γῆς) αἰχ-
20 μαλώτους, κριτὰς δὲ γῆς ἐξέστησε· καθίζων βασιλεῖς ἐπὶ θρόνους
21 καὶ περιζωννύων (αὐτοὺς) ζώνῃ ὀσφύας αὐτῶν. Ὁ ἐξαποστέλλων ἱε-
22 ρεῖς αἰχμαλώτους, δυνάστας δὲ γῆς κατέστρεφε. Διαλλάσσων χείλη
23 πιστῶν· σύνεσιν δὲ πρεσβυτέρων ἔγνω. ᾿Εκχέων ἀτιμίαν ἐπ᾿ ἀρχον-
24 τας· ταπεινοὺς δὲ ἰάσατο. Ὁ ἀποκαλύπτων βαθέα ἐκ σκότους, ἤγαγε
25 δὲ εἰς φῶς σκιὰν θανάτου. Πλανῶν ἔθνη, καὶ ἀπολλύων αὐτά·
26 καταστρωννύων ἔθνη, καὶ καθοδηγῶν αὐτά. Διαλλάσσων καρδίας
27 ἀρχόντων λαοῦ τῆς γῆς, ἐπλάνησε δὲ αὐτοὺς ὁδῷ ᾗ οὐκ ᾔδεισαν·
28 ψηλαφήσειαν σκότος, καὶ οὐ φῶς, πλανηθείησαν δὲ ὥσπερ ὁ μεθύων.

## CHAPTER XI.

**24** ...unto thee peace shall shine forth; for thou shalt be quiet, and there shall be none to make war against thee;
**25** and many shall turn themselves, and shall supplicate thee. But the eyes of the ungodly shall melt away,
**26** and salvation shall forsake them; for their hope is the perdition of the soul.
**27** (The eyes of the ungodly, moreover, shall melt away; for with Him are wisdom
**28** and power.)

## CHAPTER XII.

**1** Then Job answered and said: "Are ye indeed the only men?
**2** Or shall wisdom die with you? But with me indeed is a heart even as
**3** yours. For a man just and blameless hath been made into a derision;
**4** for unto an appointed time was I prepared to fall [before] others,
**5** and his houses to be plundered by the lawless. Yet let no man,
**6** being wicked, be confident that he shall be guiltless, [even] all those who provoke
**7** the Lord, as if their scrutiny shall not also come to pass. But now, I pray thee, ask
**8** the four-footed beasts, if they will tell thee, and the fowls of heaven, if they will declare
**9** unto thee; and the earth shall relate [it], if it will speak unto thee, and [if] the
**10** fishes of the sea shall explain unto thee. (For) who hath not known in all these things,
**11** that the hand of the Lord hath wrought these? For in His hand is the soul of all
**12** living things, and the spirit of all human flesh. For some indeed
**13** distinguish words, but the throat doth taste food for itself. In much
**14** time is wisdom found; but in a long life, knowledge. With Him [are]
**15** wisdom and power, (with) Him [are] counsel and understanding. If He should
**16** cast down, who shall build up? And if He should shut up [a man] in prison, who shall
**17** open? If He should restrain the water, He shall dry up the earth; but if (also) He should release
**18** it, He hath destroyed it, having overthrown [it]. With Him [are] dominion and strength;
**19** (with) Him [are] knowledge and understanding. He leadeth counselors (of the earth) away
**20** captive, and judges of the earth He hath made to go astray; setting kings upon thrones,
**21** and girding (them) with a girdle upon their loins. He that sendeth forth priests
**22** captive, and hath overthrown the powerful ones of the earth. Changing the lips
**23** of the faithful; and the understanding of elders He hath known. Pouring forth dishonor upon
**24** princes; but the humble He hath healed. He that revealeth deep things out of darkness,
**25** and hath brought forth into light the shadow of death. He that leadeth nations astray, and destroyeth them;
**26** overthrowing nations, and guiding them. Changing the hearts
**27** of the rulers of the people of the earth, and hath caused them to wander in a way they knew not;
**28** they shall grope in darkness, and not in light, and they shall be made to wander as a drunken man.
