ΚΕΦ. ΙΗʹ. ʹ. ΤΩΝ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ ΙΟΥΔΑ Βʹ. 793
μένους τὸν Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τοῖς ὄρεσιν ὡς πρόβατα, οἷς οὐκ ἔστι ποι-
μήν· καὶ εἶπε Κύριος· οὐκ ἔχουσιν ἡγούμενον οὗτοι, ἀναστρεφέτω-
σαν ἕκαστος εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ ἐν εἰρήνῃ. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς 17
Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς Ἰωσαφάτ· οὐκ εἶπόν σοι· οὐ προφητεύει περὶ ἐμοῦ
ἀγαθὰ ἀλλ᾿ ἢ κακά; Καὶ εἶπεν· οὐχ οὕτως· ἀκούσατε λόγον Κυ- 18
ρίου· εἶδον τὸν Κύριον καθήμενον ἐπὶ θρόνου αὐτοῦ, καὶ πᾶσα δύ-
ναμις τοῦ οὐρανοῦ παρειστήκει ἐκ δεξιῶν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐξ ἀριστερῶν
αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος· τίς ἀπατήσει τὸν Ἀχαὰβ βασιλέα Ἰσ- 19
ραήλ, καὶ ἀναβήσεται, καὶ πεσεῖται ἐν Ῥαμμὼθ Γαλαάδ; Καὶ
εἶπεν· οὗτος εἶπεν οὕτως, καὶ οὗτος εἶπεν οὕτως· καὶ ἐξῆλθε τὸ 20
πνεῦμα, καὶ ἔστη ἐνώπιον Κυρίου, καὶ εἶπεν· ἐγὼ ἀπατήσω αὐτόν.
Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος· ἐν τίνι; Καὶ εἶπεν· ἐξελεύσομαι, καὶ ἔσομαι 21
πνεῦμα ψευδὲς ἐν στόματι πάντων τῶν προφητῶν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶ-
πεν· ἀπατήσεις, καὶ δυνήσῃ. Ἔξελθε, καὶ ποίησον οὕτως. Καὶ νῦν 22
ἰδοὺ ἔδωκε Κύριος πνεῦμα ψευδὲς ἐν στόματι πάντων τῶν προφη-
τῶν σου τούτων, καὶ Κύριος ἐλάλησεν ἐπὶ σὲ κακά· καὶ ἤγγισε Σε- 23
δεκίας υἱὸς Χαναανὰ, καὶ ἐπάταξε τὸν Μιχαίαν ἐπὶ τὴν σιαγόνα,
καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· ποία τῇ ὁδῷ παρῆλθε πνεῦμα Κυρίου παρ᾿ ἐμοῦ
τοῦ λαλῆσαι πρὸς σέ; Καὶ εἶπε Μιχαίας· ἰδοὺ ὄψῃ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ
ἐκείνῃ, ἐν ᾗ εἰσελεύσῃ ταμιεῖον ἐκ ταμιείου τοῦ κατακρυβῆναι. Καὶ 25
εἶπε βασιλεὺς Ἰσραήλ· λάβετε τὸν Μιχαίαν, καὶ ἀποστρέψατε πρὸς
Ἐμὴρ τὸν ἄρχοντα τῆς πόλεως, καὶ πρὸς Ἰωὰς ἄρχοντα, υἱὸν
τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ ἐρεῖτε· οὕτως εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς ἀπόθεσθε τοῦ- 26
τον εἰς οἶκον φυλακῆς, καὶ ἐσθιέτω ἄρτον θλίψεως, καὶ ὕδωρ θλί-
ψεως, ἕως τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι με ἐν εἰρήνῃ. Καὶ εἶπε Μιχαίας· ἐὰν 27
ἐπιστρέφων ἐπιστρέψῃς ἐν εἰρήνῃ, οὐκ ἐλάλησε Κύριος ἐν ἐμοί.
Καὶ εἶπεν· ἀκούσατε λαοὶ πάντες. Καὶ ἀνέβη βασιλεὺς Ἰσραήλ, 28
καὶ Ἰωσαφάτ βασιλεὺς Ἰούδα εἰς Ῥαμμὼθ Γαλαάδ. Καὶ εἶπε βα- 29
σιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς Ἰωσαφάτ· κατακαλύφθω με, καὶ εἰσελεύσομαι
εἰς πόλεμον, καὶ σὺ ἔνδυσαι τὸν ἱματισμόν μου· καὶ συνεκάλυψατο
ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸν πόλεμον. Καὶ βασιλεὺς 30
Συρίας ἐνετείλατο τοῖς ἄρχουσι τῶν ἁρμάτων τοῖς μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ,
λέγων· μὴ πολεμεῖτε τὸν μικρὸν καὶ τὸν μέγαν, ἀλλ᾿ ἢ τὸν βα-
σιλέα Ἰσραὴλ μόνον. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς εἶδον οἱ ἄρχοντες τῶν ἀρ- 31
μάτων τὸν Ἰωσαφάτ, καὶ αὐτοὶ εἶπαν· βασιλεὺς Ἰσραήλ ἐστι, καὶ
ἐκύκλωσαν αὐτὸν τοῦ πολεμεῖν· καὶ ἐβόησεν Ἰωσαφάτ, καὶ Κύ-

**Chapter 18**

¹⁶[And Micaiah said,] "I beheld all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. And the Lord said, 'These have no leader; let them return, every man, unto his house in peace.'"
¹⁷Then the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, "Did I not tell thee, 'He prophesieth not good concerning me, but only evil'?"
¹⁸And Micaiah said, "Not so! Hear ye the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord sitting upon His throne, and all the host of heaven stood by Him, on His right hand and on His left.
¹⁹And the Lord said, 'Who shall entice Ahab, the king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?' And one spake thus, and another spake thus.
²⁰Then there came forth a spirit and stood before the Lord, and said, 'I will entice him.'
²¹And the Lord said unto him, 'Wherewith?' And he answered, 'I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.' And [the Lord] said, 'Thou shalt entice him, and thou shalt prevail. Go forth, and do so.'
²²Now therefore, behold, the Lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets; for the Lord hath spoken evil concerning thee."
²³Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah drew near and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, "Which way passed the Spirit of the Lord from me to speak unto thee?"
²⁴And Micaiah said, "Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go into a hidden chamber within a chamber to hide thyself."
²⁵Then the king of Israel said, "Take Micaiah, and send him back unto Amon, the governor of the city, and to Joash, the son of the king.
²⁶And say, 'Thus saith the king: Put this fellow in the house of the prison, and let him eat the bread of affliction and the water of affliction, until I return in peace.'"
²⁷And Micaiah said, "If thou shalt indeed return in peace, then hath the Lord not spoken in me." And he added, "Hear ye, all ye people!"
²⁸So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.
²⁹And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, "Let me disguise myself, and I will go into the battle; but do thou put on my raiment." And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.
³⁰Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of his chariots that were with him, saying, "Fight ye neither with the small nor with the great, but only with the king of Israel."
³¹And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, "It is the king of Israel!" And they compassed him about to fight; but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the Lord did save him.
