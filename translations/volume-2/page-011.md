λεί ἐν θυμιάματι καὶ ἐν θυσίαις ἕως αἰῶνος. Καὶ κοιμᾶται Σα- 15
μουὴλ ἕως πρωΐ, καὶ ὤρθρισε τὸ πρωΐ, καὶ ἤνοιξε τὰς θύρας οἴ-
κου Κυρίου. Καὶ Σαμουὴλ ἐφοβήθη ἀναγγεῖλαι τὴν ὅρασιν τῷ Ἡ-
λεί. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἤλεὶ πρὸς Σαμουήλ· Σαμουὴλ τέκνον. Καὶ εἶ- 16
πεν· ἰδοὺ ἐγώ. Καὶ εἶπε· τί τὸ ῥῆμα τὸ λαληθὲν πρὸς σέ; μὴ 17
δὴ κρύψῃς ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ· τάδε ποιήσαι σοι ὁ Θεὸς καὶ τάδε προσ-
θείη, ἐὰν κρύψῃς ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ ῥῆμα ἐκ πάντων τῶν λόγων τῶν λα-
ληθέντων σοι ἐν τοῖς ὠσί σου. Καὶ ἀπήγγειλεν αὐτῷ Σαμουὴλ 18
πάντας τοὺς λόγους, καὶ οὐκ ἔκρυψεν ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἤ-
λεὶ· Κύριος αὐτός, τὸ ἀγαθὸν ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ (αὐτὸς) ποιήσει. Καὶ 19
ἐμεγαλύνθη Σαμουήλ, καὶ Κύριος ἦν μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἔπε-
σεν ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν λόγων αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν. Καὶ ἔγνωσαν 20
πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ ἀπὸ Δὰν καὶ ἕως Βηρσαβεέ, ὅτι πιστὸς Σαμουὴλ
εἰς προφήτην τῷ Κυρίῳ. Καὶ προσέθετο Κύριος δηλωθῆναι ἐν Ση- 21
λὼ, ὅτι ἀπεκαλύφθη Κύριος πρὸς Σαμουήλ. Καὶ ἐπιστεύθη Σα-
μουὴλ προφήτης γενέσθαι τοῦ Κυρίου εἰς πάντα Ἰσραὴλ ἀπ᾿ ἄ-
κρων τῆς γῆς ἕως ἄκρων. Καὶ Ἤλεὶ πρεσβύτης σφόδρα, καὶ οἱ
υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ πορευόμενοι ἐπορεύοντο, καὶ πονηρὰ ἡ ὁδὸς αὐτῶν ἐνώ-
πιον Κυρίου.

ΚΕΦ. Δ΄. IV.

ΚΑΙ ἐγενήθη ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις, καὶ συναθροίζονται ἀλ- 1
λόφυλοι εἰς πόλεμον ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ· καὶ ἐξῆλθεν εἰς ἀπάντησιν αὐτοῖς
Ἰσραὴλ εἰς πόλεμον, καὶ παρεμβάλλουσιν ἐπὶ Ἀβενέζερ, καὶ οἱ ἀλ-
λόφυλοι παρεμβάλλουσιν ἐν Ἀφέκ. Καὶ παρατάσσονται οἱ ἀλλόφυ- 2
λοι εἰς πόλεμον ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ· καὶ ἔκλινεν ὁ πόλεμος, καὶ ἔπται-
σεν ἀνὴρ Ἰσραὴλ ἐνώπιον ἀλλοφύλων, καὶ ἐπλήγησαν ἐν τῇ πα-
ρατάξει ἐν ἀγρῷ τέσσαρες χιλιάδες ἀνδρῶν. Καὶ ἦλθεν ὁ λαὸς εἰς 3
τὴν παρεμβολήν, καὶ εἶπαν οἱ πρεσβύτεροι Ἰσραήλ· κατὰ τί ἔ-
πταισεν ἡμᾶς Κύριος σήμερον ἐνώπιον ἀλλοφύλων; λάβωμεν πρὸς
ἡμᾶς ἐκ Σηλὼ τὴν κιβωτὸν τῆς διαθήκης τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν (εἰς
Σηλὼμ), καὶ ἐξελθέτω ἐν μέσῳ ἡμῶν, καὶ σώσει ἡμᾶς ἐκ χει-
ρὸς ἐχθρῶν ἡμῶν. Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ὁ λαὸς εἰς Σηλὼ, καὶ αἴρου- 4
σιν ἐκεῖθεν τὴν κιβωτὸν τῆς διαθήκης Κυρίου τῶν δυνάμεων καθῃ-
μένου Χερουβείμ· καὶ ἀμφότεροι υἱοὶ Ἤλεὶ μετὰ τῆς κιβωτοῦ τῆς

**Chapter 3**

15 ...be purged with incense nor with sacrifice for ever." And Samuel slept until the morning light; and he rose betimes in the morning, and opened the doors of the House of the Lord. But Samuel feared to declare the vision unto Eli.
16 Then Eli called unto Samuel and said, "Samuel, my son." And he answered, "Behold, I am [here]."
17 And he said, "What is the word that was spoken unto thee? I pray thee, hide it not from me. God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide from me a [single] word of all the words that were spoken unto thee in thine ears."
18 And Samuel told him all the words, and hid nothing from him. And Eli said, "He is the Lord; that which is good in His sight, He [Himself] shall do."
19 And Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him, and suffered none of his words to fall to the ground.
20 And all Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, knew that Samuel was a faithful prophet unto the Lord.
21 And the Lord continued to manifest Himself in Shiloh, for the Lord was revealed unto Samuel. And Samuel was believed to be a prophet of the Lord throughout all Israel, from the uttermost parts of the land even unto the uttermost parts [thereof].
Now Eli was exceeding old; and his sons, continuing on their way, went, and their path was wicked before the Lord.

**Chapter 4**

1 And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered themselves together to battle against Israel; and Israel went out to meet them in war. And they encamped at Ebenezer, and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.
2 And the Philistines arrayed themselves for battle against Israel; and the battle turned, and Israel was defeated before the Philistines, and there were smitten in the battle-line in the field, four thousand men.
3 And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, "Wherefore hath the Lord smitten us this day before the Philistines? Let us fetch unto us from Shiloh the Ark of the Covenant of our God (unto Shiloh), that it may come among us and save us from the hand of our enemies."
4 So the people sent to Shiloh, and brought thence the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord of Hosts, Who sitteth [enthroned] upon the Cherubim. And both the sons of Eli were with the Ark thereof.
