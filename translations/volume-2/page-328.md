σι παρεγένετο δύναμις Συρίας. Καὶ ὁ Θεὸς παρέδωκεν εἰς τὰς χεῖ-
ρας αὐτῶν δύναμιν πολλὴν σφόδρα, ὅτι ἐγκατέλιπον Κύριον τὸν
25 Θεὸν τῶν πατέρων ἑαυτῶν· καὶ μετὰ Ἰωὰς ἐποίησε κρίματα. Καὶ
μετὰ τὸ ἀπελθεῖν αὐτοὺς ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ, ἐν τῷ ἐγκαταλιπεῖν αὐτὸν
ἐν μαλακίαις μεγάλαις, καὶ ἐπέθεντο αὐτῷ οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ ἐν αἵ-
μασιν υἱοῦ Ἰωδαὲ τοῦ ἱερέως, καὶ ἐθανάτωσαν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τῆς κλί-
νης αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀπέθανε· καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν ἐν πόλει Δαυίδ, καὶ
26 οὐκ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν ἐν τῷ τάφῳ τῶν βασιλέων. Καὶ οἱ ἐπιθέμενοι
ἐπ᾿ αὐτόν, Ζαβὲδ ὁ τοῦ Σαμαὰδ ὁ Ἀμμανίτης, καὶ Ἰωζαβὲδ ὁ τοῦ
27 Σαμαρίθ ὁ Μωαβίτης. Καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ πάντες, καὶ προσῆλθον
αὐτῷ οἱ πέντε. Καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ ἰδοὺ γεγραμμένα ἐπὶ γραφὴν τῶν
βασιλέων, καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Ἀμασίας υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΕ´. XXV.

1 ὪΝ πέντε καὶ εἴκοσι ἐτῶν ἐβασίλευσεν Ἀμασίας, καὶ εἴκοσι
καὶ ἐννέα ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ὄνομα τῇ μητρὶ
2 αὐτοῦ Ἰωαδὶν ἀπὸ Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ εὐθὲς ἐνώπιον
3 Κυρίου, ἀλλ᾿ οὐκ ἐν καρδίᾳ πλήρει. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς κατέσχη ἡ βα-
σιλεία ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐθανάτωσε τοὺς παῖδας ἑαυτοῦ τοὺς φο-
4 νεύσαντας τὸν βασιλέα πατέρα αὐτοῦ. Καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτῶν οὐκ
ἀπέκτεινε κατὰ τὴν διαθήκην νόμου Κυρίου, καθὼς γέγραπται, ὡς
ἐνετείλατο Κύριος, λέγων· οὐκ ἀποθανοῦνται πατέρες ὑπὲρ τέκνων,
καὶ υἱοὶ οὐκ ἀποθανοῦνται ὑπὲρ πατέρων, ἀλλ᾿ ἕκαστος τῇ ἑαυ-
5 τοῦ ἁμαρτίᾳ ἀποθανοῦνται. Καὶ συνήγαγεν Ἀμασίας τὸν οἶκον
Ἰούδα, καὶ ἀνέστησεν αὐτοὺς κατ᾿ οἴκους πατριῶν αὐτῶν εἰς χι-
λιάρχους καὶ ἑκατοντάρχους ἐν παντὶ Ἰούδα καὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ.
Καὶ ἠρίθμησεν αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ εἰκοσαετοῦς καὶ ἐπάνω, καὶ εὗρεν αὐ-
τοὺς τριακοσίας χιλιάδας, δυνατοὺς ἐξελθεῖν εἰς πόλεμον, κρα-
6 τοῦντας δόρυ καὶ θυρεόν. Καὶ ἐμισθώσατο ἀπὸ Ἰσραὴλ ἑκατὸν
7 χιλιάδας, δυνατοὺς ἰσχύϊ, ἑκατὸν ταλάντων ἀργυρίου. Καὶ ἄν-
θρωπος τοῦ Θεοῦ ἦλθε πρὸς αὐτόν, λέγων· βασιλεῦ, οὐ παρελεύ-
σεται μετὰ σοῦ δύναμις Ἰσραήλ, ὅτι οὐκ ἔστι Κύριος μετὰ Ἰσ-
8 ραήλ, πάντων τῶν υἱῶν Ἐφραίμ. Ὅτι ἐὰν ὑπολάβῃς κατισχῦσαι
ἐν τούτοις, καὶ τροπώσεταί σε Κύριος ἔναντι τῶν ἐχθρῶν, ὅτι ἔστι
9 παρὰ Κυρίου κατισχῦσαι ἐν τούτοις, καὶ τροπώσεσθαι. Καὶ εἶπεν

**English Translation:**

#### CHAPTER XXIV.

²⁴ ...[with a small company of men] did the host of Syria come. And God delivered into their hands a very great host, because they had forsaken the Lord God of their fathers.

²⁵ And against Joash, He executed judgments. And when they were departed from him, [and] had left him in great infirmities, then his servants conspired against him, by reason of the blood of the son of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him upon his bed, and he died. And they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchers of the kings.

²⁶ Now they that conspired against him were Zabad, the son of Samaad, the Ammonite, and Jehozabad, the son of Samarith, the Moabite.

²⁷ And his sons, all of them, and the five [others] came unto him. And the rest, behold, are written in the record of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.

#### CHAPTER XXV.

¹ Amaziah was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Ioadin, of Jerusalem.

² And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, but not with a perfect heart.

³ And it came to pass, when the kingdom was established in his hand, that he slew his servants who had slain the king his father.

⁴ But their children he slew not, according to the covenant of the Law of the Lord, as it is written, as the Lord commanded, saying, “Fathers shall not die for their children, nor shall children die for their fathers; but each one shall die for his own sin.”

⁵ Moreover, Amaziah gathered the house of Judah, and set them according to the houses of their fathers, under captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, throughout all Judah and Jerusalem. And he numbered them from twenty years old and upward, and found them three hundred thousand choice men, able to go forth to war, holding spear and shield.

⁶ He hired also out of Israel an hundred thousand mighty men of valor, for an hundred talents of silver.

⁷ And there came a man of God to him, saying, “O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the Lord is not with Israel, [nor] with any of the sons of Ephraim.

⁸ For if thou shalt presume to prevail with these, then the Lord shall turn thee back before thine enemies; for with the Lord doth rest the power to make strong through these, or to cause to be put to flight.”

⁹ And [Amaziah] said
