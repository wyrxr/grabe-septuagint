**1** ΚΑὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἀνάγειν Κύριον τὸν Ἠλιοὺ ἐν συσσεισμῷ ὡς εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν, καὶ ἐπορεύθη Ἠλιοὺ καὶ Ἐλισσαιὲ ἐκ Γαλγάλων.
**2** Καὶ εἶπεν Ἠλιοὺ πρὸς Ἐλισσαιέ· κάθου δὴ ἐνταῦθα, ὅτι Κύριος ἀπέστειλέ με ἕως Βαιθήλ. καὶ εἶπεν Ἐλισσαιέ· Ζῇ Κύριος, καὶ ζῇ ἡ ψυχή σου, εἰ καταλείψω σε· καὶ ἦλθον εἰς Βαιθήλ.
**3** Καὶ ἦλθον οἱ υἱοὶ τῶν προφητῶν οἱ εἰς Βαιθήλ πρὸς Ἐλισσαιέ, καὶ εἶπον πρὸς αὐτὸν (οἱ υἱοὶ τῶν προφητῶν)· εἰ ἔγνως, ὅτι Κύριος σήμερον λαμβάνει τὸν κύριόν σου ἀπάνωθεν τῆς κεφαλῆς σου; καὶ εἶπε· καὶ ἐγὼ ἔγνωκα, σιωπᾶτε.

**1** And it came to pass, when the Lord would take up Elijah in a commotion, as it were, into heaven, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgals.
**2** And Elijah said unto Elisha, "Tarry here, I pray thee, for the Lord hath sent me as far as Bethel." And Elisha said, "As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee!" So they came to Bethel.
**3** And the sons of the prophets who were in Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said unto him (even the sons of the prophets), "Knowest thou that the Lord will take thy master from over thy head today?" And he said, "Yea, I know [it]; hold ye your peace!"

**10** And Elijah said, "Thou hast asked a hard thing [of me]. Nevertheless, if thou shalt see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so."
