ΚΕΦ. ΙΗ΄.
**7** μῷ Ἐφραίμ. Καὶ ἔπταισεν ἐκεῖ (πᾶς) ὁ λαὸς Ἰσραὴλ ἐνώπιον τῶν παίδων Δαυΐδ, καὶ ἐγένετο ἡ θραῦσις μεγάλη ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ
**8** ἐκείνῃ, εἴκοσι χιλιάδες ἀνδρῶν. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐκεῖ ὁ πόλεμος διεσπαρμένος ἐπὶ πρόσωπον πάσης τῆς γῆς. Καὶ ἐπλεόνασεν ὁ δρυμὸς τοῦ καταφαγεῖν ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ ὑπὲρ οὓς κατέφαγεν ἡ μάχαιρα ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ.
**9** Καὶ συνήντησεν Ἀβεσσαλὼμ ἐνώπιον τῶν παίδων Δαυΐδ· καὶ Ἀβεσσαλὼμ ἐπιβεβηκὼς ἐπὶ τοῦ ἡμιόνου αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἰσῆλθεν ὁ ἡμίονος ὑπὸ τὸ δάσος τῆς δρυὸς τῆς μεγάλης, καὶ περιεπλάκη ἡ κεφαλὴ αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ δρυΐ, καὶ ἐκρεμάσθη ἀναμέσον τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ ἀναμέσον τῆς γῆς, καὶ ὁ ἡμίονος ὁ ὑποκάτω αὐτοῦ, παρῆλθε.
**10** Καὶ ἴδεν ἀνὴρ εἷς, καὶ ἀνήγγειλε τῷ Ἰωάβ, καὶ εἶπεν· Ἰδοὺ
**11** ἑώρακα τὸν Ἀβεσσαλὼμ κρεμάμενον ἐν τῇ δρυΐ. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰωὰβ τῷ ἀνδρὶ τῷ ἀγγέλλοντι αὐτῷ· καὶ ἰδοὺ ἑώρακας· τί ὅτι οὐκ ἐπάταξας αὐτὸν ἐκεῖ εἰς τὴν γῆν; καὶ ἐγὼ ἂν ἐδεδώκειν σοι δέκα ἀργυρίου καὶ παραζώνην μίαν.
**12** Εἶπε δὲ ἀνὴρ πρὸς Ἰωάβ· καὶ ἐγὼ εἰμι, ἵστημι ἐπὶ τὰς χεῖράς μου χιλίους σίκλους ἀργυρίου, οὐ μὴ ἐπιβάλω τὴν χεῖρά μου ἐπὶ τὸν υἱὸν τοῦ βασιλέως, ὅτι ἐν τοῖς ὠσὶν ἡμῶν ἐνετείλατο ὁ βασιλεύς σοι, καὶ τῷ Ἀβεσσαί, καὶ τῷ Ἐθθεί,
**13** λέγων· φυλάξατέ μοι τὸ παιδάριον, τὸν Ἀβεσσαλώμ, μὴ ποιῆσαι ἐν τῇ ψυχῇ αὐτοῦ ἄδικον. Καὶ πᾶς λόγος οὐ λήσεται ἀπὸ
**14** τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ σὺ στήσῃ ἐξεναντίας. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰωὰβ τοῦτο ἐγὼ ἄρξομαι ἐνώπιόν σου. Καὶ ἔλαβεν Ἰωὰβ τρία βέλη ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐνέπηξεν αὐτὰ εἰς τὴν καρδίαν Ἀβεσσαλώμ, ἔτι αὐτοῦ ζῶντος ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ τῆς δρυός.
**15** Καὶ ἐκύκλωσαν δέκα παιδάρια αἴροντα τὰ σκεύη Ἰωάβ, καὶ ἐπάταξαν τὸν Ἀβεσσαλώμ, καὶ ἐθανάτωσαν αὐτόν.
**16** Καὶ ἐσάλπισεν Ἰωὰβ ἐν κερατίνῃ, καὶ ἀπέστρεψεν ὁ λαὸς τοῦ μὴ διώκειν ὀπίσω Ἰσραὴλ, ἔτι ἐφείδετο Ἰωὰβ τοῦ λαοῦ.
**17** Καὶ ἔλαβε τὸν Ἀβεσσαλώμ, καὶ ἔῤῥιψεν αὐτὸν εἰς χάσμα μέγα ἐν τῷ δρυμῷ εἰς τὸν βόθυνον τὸν μέγαν, καὶ ἐστήλωσεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν σωρὸν λίθων μέγαν σφόδρα. Καὶ πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ ἔφυγεν ἀνὴρ εἰς τὸ σκήνωμα αὐτοῦ.
**18** Καὶ Ἀβεσσαλὼμ ἔτι ζῶν ἔλαβε, καὶ ἐστήλωσεν αὐτῷ (λαβεῖν) τὴν στήλωσιν τὴν ἐν τῇ κοιλάδι τοῦ βασιλέως, (ὡς) ὅτι εἶπεν· οὐκ ἔστι μοι υἱὸς ἕνεκεν τοῦ ἀναμνῆσαι τὸ ὄνομά μου· καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὴν στήλην ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὴν στήλην, Χεὶρ Ἀβεσσαλὼμ ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης.
**19** Καὶ Ἀχιμάας υἱὸς Σαδὼκ εἶπε· δράμω δὴ, καὶ εὐαγγελίᾳ τῷ βασιλεῖ, ὅτι ἔκρινε Κύριος ἐκ χειρὸς τῶν ἐχθρῶν αὐτοῦ.

**7** ... of Ephraim. And the people of Israel, even all of them, were there defeated before the servants of David, and the slaughter was great on that day,
**8** even twenty thousand men. And the battle there was scattered over the face of all the land. And the forest consumed more of the people than those whom the sword consumed on that day.

**9** And Absalom came upon the servants of David; and Absalom was mounted upon his mule, and the mule went under the dense growth of the great oak, and his head became entangled in the oak, and he was left hanging between heaven and earth, while the mule beneath him passed onward.

**10** And one man saw it, and told Joab, and said, 'Behold,
**11** I have seen Absalom hanging in the oak.' And Joab said unto the man who told him, 'And behold, thou hast seen him! Why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? Then would I have given thee ten [shekels of] silver and one belt.'

**12** And the man said unto Joab, 'Though I were to hold in my hands a thousand shekels of silver, yet would I not lay my hand upon the king's son; for in our hearing the king charged thee, and Abishai, and Ittai,
**13** saying, "Deal gently, for my sake, with the young man, even with Absalom, and do no harm to his person." And no word shall be hidden from the king, and thou wouldst stand as his adversary.'

**14** And Joab said, 'I will not tarry thus with thee concerning this.' And Joab took three darts in his hand, and thrust them into the heart of Absalom, whilst he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.
**15** And ten young men, bearing Joab's armor, surrounded him, and smote Absalom, and slew him.

**16** And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people turned back from pursuing after Israel, for Joab spared the people yet.

**17** And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great chasm in the forest, even into a great pit, and they raised over him a very great heap of stones. And all Israel fled, every man to his tent.

**18** Now Absalom, whilst he was yet alive, had taken and set up for himself (to possess) the pillar which is in the King's Valley, for he had said, 'I have no son to keep my name in remembrance.' And he called the pillar after his own name, and he called the pillar, 'Absalom's Hand,' even unto this day.

**19** And Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, 'Let me now run, and bring good tidings unto the king, that the Lord hath judged him from the hand of his enemies.'
