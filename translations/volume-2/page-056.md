11 τοῦ κυρίου αὐτοῦ. Καὶ λήψομαι τοὺς ἄρτους μου καὶ τὸν οἶνόν
μου καὶ τὰ θύματά μου ἃ τέθυκα τοῖς κείρουσί μου τὰ πρόβατα,
12 καὶ δώσω αὐτὰ ἀνδράσιν, οἷς οὐκ οἶδα πόθεν εἰσί; Καὶ ἀπεστάφησαν τὰ παιδάρια Δαυΐδ εἰς ὁδὸν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἀνέστρεψαν, καὶ
ἦλθαν, καὶ ἀνήγγειλαν τῷ Δαυΐδ κατὰ πάντα τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα.
13 Καὶ εἶπε Δαυΐδ τοῖς ἀνδράσιν αὐτοῦ· Ζώσασθε ἕκαστος τὴν ῥομφαίαν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ περιεζώσαντο ἀνὴρ τὴν μάχαιραν αὐτοῦ· καὶ
περιεζώσατο καὶ Δαυΐδ τὴν μάχαιραν αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἀνέβησαν ὀπίσω
Δαυΐδ, ὡς τετρακόσιοι ἄνδρες· καὶ οἱ διακόσιοι ἐκάθισαν μετὰ
14 τῶν σκευῶν. Καὶ τῇ Ἀβιγαίᾳ γυναικὶ Νάβαλ ἀπήγγειλεν ἓν τῶν
παιδαρίων, λέγων· Ἰδοὺ ἀπέστειλε Δαυΐδ ἀγγέλους ἐκ τῆς ἐρήμου
15 εὐλογῆσαι τὸν κύριον ἡμῶν, καὶ ἐξέκλινεν ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν. Καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες ἀγαθοὶ ἡμῖν σφόδρα οὐκ ἀπεκώλυσαν ἡμᾶς, οὐδὲ ἐνετείλαντο ἡμῖν οὐδὲν πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας ἃς ἦμεν παρ᾿ αὐτοῖς. Καὶ ἐν
16 τῷ εἶναι ἡμᾶς ἐν ἀγρῷ, ὡς τεῖχος ἦσαν περὶ ἡμᾶς καὶ τὴν νύκτα καὶ τὴν ἡμέραν πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας ἃς ἤμεθα παρ᾿ αὐτοῖς
17 ποιμαίνοντες τὸ ποίμνιον. Καὶ νῦν γνῶθι καὶ ἴδε· τί σὺ ποιήσεις, ὅτι συντετέλεσται ἡ κακία εἰς τὸν κύριον ἡμῶν, καὶ εἰς πάντο τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ· καὶ οὗτος υἱὸς λοιμός, καὶ οὐκ ἔστι λαλῆσαι πρὸς αὐτόν.
18 Καὶ ἔσπευσεν Ἀβιγαία καὶ ἔλαβε διακοσίους
ἄρτους καὶ δύο ἀγγεῖα οἴνου, καὶ πέντε πρόβατα πεποιημένα, καὶ
πέντε οἰφεὶ ἀλφίτου, καὶ γόμορ ἓν σταφίδος, καὶ διακοσίας παλάθας, καὶ ἔθετο ἐπὶ τοὺς ὄνους.
19 Καὶ εἶπε τοῖς παιδαρίοις αὐτῆς· προπορεύεσθε ἔμπροσθέν μου, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ὀπίσω ὑμῶν παραγίνομαι, καὶ τῷ ἀνδρὶ αὐτῆς Νάβαλ οὐκ ἀπήγγειλε.
20 Καὶ ἐγενήθη, αὐτῆς ἐπιβεβηκυίης ἐπὶ τὴν ὄνον καὶ καταβαινούσης ἐν σκέπῃ τοῦ ὄρους, καὶ ἰδοὺ Δαυΐδ καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες αὐτοῦ κατέβαινον εἰς
συνάντησιν αὐτῆς, καὶ ἀπήντησεν αὐτοῖς.
21 Καὶ Δαυΐδ εἶπεν· ἴσως εἰς ἄδικον πεφύλακα πάντα τὰ αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, καὶ οὐκ ἐνετειλάμεθα λαβεῖν ἐκ πάντων τῶν αὐτοῦ οὐθέν, καὶ ἀνταπέδωκέ μοι πονηρὰ ἀντὶ ἀγαθῶν.
22 Τάδε ποιήσαι ὁ Θεὸς τῷ Δαυΐδ καὶ τάδε προσθείη, εἰ ὑπολείψομαι ἐκ πάντων τῶν τοῦ Νάβαλ ἕως
πρωῒ οὐροῦντα πρὸς τοῖχον.
23 Καὶ ἴδεν Ἀβιγαία τὸν Δαυΐδ, καὶ
ἔσπευσε, καὶ κατεπήδησεν ἀπὸ τῆς ὄνου, καὶ ἔπεσεν ἐνώπιον Δαυΐδ
ἐπὶ πρόσωπον αὐτῆς, καὶ προσεκύνησεν αὐτῷ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν.
24 Καὶ ἔπεσεν ἐπὶ τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπεν· ἐν ἐμοί, Κύριέ μου, ἡ

**11** [of] his master. And shall I take my bread, and my wine, and my slaughtered provisions, which I have made ready for my shearers, and give them unto men whom I know not whence they be?"
**12** So David's young men turned back on their way, and returned, and came and declared unto David all these words.
**13** And David said unto his men, "Gird ye on every man his sword." And every man girded on his sword; and David also girded on his sword. And there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred remained with the baggage.
**14** But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, "Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to bless our master; but he reviled them.
**15** And the men were very good unto us, and they did not hinder us, neither did they lay any burden upon us all the days that we were with them.
**16** And while we were in the field, they were a wall unto us both by night and by day, all the days that we were with them, keeping the flock.
**17** Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his house: for this man is a son of pestilence, and it is not possible to speak unto him."
**18** Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two vessels of wine, and five sheep dressed, and five ephahs of parched [grain], and one omer of raisins, and two hundred fig-cakes, and laid them on asses.
**19** And she said unto her young men, "Go on before me; behold, I come after you." But she told not her husband Nabal.
**20** And it came to pass, as she rode on the ass, and came down by the covert of the mountain, behold, David and his men came down against her; and she met them.
**21** And David had said, "Surely it was for nought that I have kept all that belonged to him in the wilderness, so that we commanded not to take aught from all that was his; and he hath repaid me evil for good.
**22** So and more also do God unto David, and so add [unto him], if I leave of all that belong to Nabal, by the morning light, one that urinates against the wall."
**23** And when Abigail saw David, she made haste, and dismounted from the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground.
**24** And she fell at his feet, and said, "Upon me, my lord, let the iniquity be."
