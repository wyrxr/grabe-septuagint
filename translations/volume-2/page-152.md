ΚΕΦ. ΙΑ ́.
γῆν ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ. Καὶ εὗρεν ῞Αδερ χάριν ἐναντίον Φαραὼ σφόδρα, 19
καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ γυναῖκα, ἀδελφὴν τῆς γυναικὸς αὐτοῦ, ἀδελ-
φὴν Θεκτεμίνας τὴν μείζω. Καὶ ἔτεκεν αὐτῷ ἡ ἀδελφὴ Θεκτεμίνας 20
τῷ ῞Αδερ τὸν Γανηβάθ, υἱὸν αὐτῆς· καὶ ἐξέθρεψεν αὐτὸν Θεκτεμίνα
ἐν μέσῳ υἱῶν Φαραώ· καὶ ἦν Γανηβὰθ ἐν μέσῳ υἱῶν
Φαραώ. Καὶ ῞Αδερ ἤκουσεν ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ ὅτι κεκοίμηται Δαυὶδ μετὰ 21
τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὅτι τέθνηκεν Ἰωὰβ ὁ ἄρχων τῆς στρατιᾶς,
καὶ εἶπεν ῞Αδερ πρὸς Φαραώ, ἐξαπόστειλόν με, καὶ ἀποστρέ-
ψω εἰς τὴν γῆν μου. Καὶ εἶπε Φαραώ, τίνι σὺ ἐλαττονῇ μετ’ 22
ἐμοῦ; καὶ ἰδοὺ σὺ ζητεῖς ἀπελθεῖν εἰς τὴν γῆν σου; καὶ εἶπεν
αὐτῷ ῞Αδερ, ὅτι ἐξαποστέλλων ἐξαποστελεῖς με· καὶ ἀνέστρεψεν
῞Αδερ εἰς τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἤγειρε Κύριος Σατᾶν τῷ Σαλωμὼν 23
τὸν Ῥαζὼν, υἱὸν Ἐλιαδὰν τὸν Βαραμεὲθ Ἀδαδέζερ βασιλέα
Σουβά, κύριον αὐτοῦ. Καὶ συνηθροίσθησαν ἐπ’ αὐτὸν ἄνδρες, καὶ 24
ἦν ἄρχων συστρέμματος ἐν τῷ ἀποκτείνειν Δαυὶδ αὐτούς· καὶ ἐ-
πορεύθησαν Δαμασκὸν, καὶ ἐκάθισαν ἐν αὐτῇ, καὶ ἐβασίλευσαν ἐν
Δαμασκῷ. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἀντικείμενος τῷ Ἰσραὴλ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας 25
Σαλωμών· αὕτη ἡ κακία ῞Αδερ· καὶ ἐβαρυθύμησεν Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ
ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν τῷ Ἐδώμ. Καὶ Ἱεροβοὰμ, υἱὸς Ναβὰτ, ὁ Ἐφραθὶ 26
ἐκ τῆς Σαριδά, (καὶ ὄνομα τῆς μητρὸς αὐτοῦ Σαρουά, γυνὴ χήρα,)
δοῦλος Σαλωμὼν, καὶ ὕψωσε χεῖρα ἐν τῷ βασιλεῖ.
Καὶ τοῦτο τὸ πρᾶγμα, ὡς ἐπήρπατο χεῖρας ἐπὶ βασιλέα Σαλωμὼν 27
ᾠκοδόμησε τὴν ἄκραν, καὶ συνέκλεισε τὸν φραγμὸν τῆς πόλεως
Δαυὶδ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ὁ ἄνθρωπος Ἱεροβοὰμ ἰσχυρὸς 28
δυνάμει· καὶ εἶδε Σαλωμὼν τὸ παιδάριον ὅτι ἀνὴρ ἔργων ἐστὶ,
καὶ κατέστησεν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ ἄρσεις οἴκου Ἰωσήφ. Καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐν 29
τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ, καὶ Ἱεροβοὰμ ἐξῆλθεν ἐξ Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ εὗρεν
αὐτὸν Ἀχιὰς ὁ Σηλωνίτης ὁ προφήτης ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ, καὶ ἀπέστησεν
αὐτὸν ἐκ τῆς ὁδοῦ· καὶ ὁ Ἀχιὰς περιβεβλημένος ἱματίῳ
καινῷ· καὶ ἀμφότεροι ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ. Καὶ ἐπελάβετο Ἀχιὰ τοῦ 30
ἱματίου αὐτοῦ τοῦ καινοῦ τοῦ ἐπ’ αὐτῷ, καὶ διέρρηξεν αὐτὸ δώδεκα
ῥήγματα. Καὶ εἶπε τῷ Ἱεροβοὰμ, λαβὲ σεαυτῷ δέκα ῥήγματα, 31
ὅτι τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ, Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ῥήσσω τὴν
βασιλείαν ἐκ χειρὸς Σαλωμὼν, καὶ δώσω σοι δέκα ῥήγματα.
Καὶ δύο σκῆπτρα ἔσονται αὐτῷ διὰ τὸν δοῦλόν μου Δαυὶδ, καὶ διὰ 32
Ἱερουσαλὴμ τὴν πόλιν ἣν ἐξελεξάμην ἐν αὐτῇ ἐκ πασῶν φυλῶν

**19** and gave him land. And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, insomuch that he gave him a wife, the sister of his own wife, even the elder sister of Tahpenes.
**20** And the sister of Tahpenes bore unto Hadad his son, Genubath; and Tahpenes nourished him among the sons of Pharaoh, and Genubath was among the sons of Pharaoh.
**21** And Hadad heard in Egypt that David was fallen asleep with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead; and Hadad said unto Pharaoh, “Send me away, and I will return unto mine own land.”
**22** And Pharaoh said unto him, “Wherein art thou diminished whilst with me, that, behold, thou seekest to depart unto thine own land?” And Hadad said unto him, “Nay, but thou must surely send me forth.” And Hadad returned unto his own land.
**23** And the Lord raised up an adversary unto Solomon, even Rezon, the son of Eliada, the Baramaeth Hadadezer, king of Zobah, his master.
**24** And men gathered unto him, and he was captain of a troop when David slew them; and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus.
**25** And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon; this was the wickedness of Hadad; and Israel was grieved, and he reigned in Edom.
**26** And Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda (and the name of his mother was Zeruah, a widowed woman), a servant of Solomon, lifted up his hand against the king.
**27** And this was the matter, when he had lifted up hands against King Solomon: for Solomon built the citadel, and closed up the breach of the city of David his father.
**28** And the man Jeroboam was mighty in strength; and Solomon saw the youth, that he was a man of [great] works, and appointed him over the levies of the house of Joseph.
**29** And it came to pass at that time, that Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, and Ahijah the Shilonite the prophet found him in the way, and turned him aside out of the way; and Ahijah was clothed with a new garment; and they two were in the field.
**30** And Ahijah laid hold of his new garment that was upon him, and rent it into twelve pieces.
**31** And he said to Jeroboam, “Take unto thyself ten pieces, for thus saith the Lord God of Israel: ‘Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give unto thee ten pieces [tribes].’”
**32** “But two scepters [tribes] shall be to him, for My servant David’s sake, and for Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen therein out of all the tribes [of Israel].”
