29 δὲ ἔστιν ὁ τετοκὼς (συνοχὰς καὶ) βώλους δρόσου; Ἐκ γαστρὸς
30 δὲ τίνος ἐκπορεύεται κρύσταλλος; πάγην δὲ ἐν οὐρανῷ τίς τέτο-
31 κεν, ἢ καταβαίνει ὡς ὕδωρ ῥέον; πρόσωπον δὲ ἀβύσσου τίς ἔπηξας;
32 Ἢ διανοίξεις Μαζουρὼθ ἐν καιρῷ αὐτοῦ; καὶ ἔσπερον ἐπὶ
33 κώμης αὐτοῦ (καὶ) ἄξεις αὐτά; Ἐπίστασαι δὲ τροπὰς οὐρανοῦ,
34 ἢ τὰ ὑπ᾽ οὐρανὸν ὁμοθυμαδὸν γινόμενα; Καλέσεις δὲ νέφος φω-
35 νῇ, καὶ δρόμῳ ὕδατος λάβρου ὑπακούσεταί σοι; Ἀποστελεῖς δὲ
36 κεραυνούς, καὶ πορεύσονται; ἐροῦσί δέ σοι, τί ἐστι; Τίς ἔδωκε
37 γυναιξὶν ὑφάσματος σοφίαν, καὶ ποικιλτικὴν (σοφίας) ἐπιστή-
38 μην; Τίς δὲ ὁ ἀριθμῶν νέφη σοφία, οὐρανὸν δὲ εἰς γῆν ἔκλινε;
39 Κέχυται γὰρ ὥσπερ γῆ χωνεία, κεκόλληκε δὲ αὐτὸν ὥσπερ κύ-
40 βον λίθοις. Θηρεύσεις δὲ λέουσι βοράν, ψυχὰς δὲ δρακόντων
41 ἐμπλήσεις; Δεδοίκασι γὰρ ἐν κοίταις αὐτῶν, κάθηνται δὲ ἐν
    ὕλαις ἐνεδρεύοντες. Τίς δὲ ἡτοίμασε κόρακι βοράν; νεοσσοὶ δὲ
    αὐτοῦ πρὸς Κύριον (αὐτοῦ) κεκράγασι, πλανώμενοι τὰ σῖτα
    ζητοῦντες.

1 Ἢ ἔγνως καιρὸν τοκετοῦ τραγελάφων πέτρας, ἐφύλαξας δὲ ὠδῖ-
2 νας ἐλάφων; Ἠρίθμησας δὲ αὐτῶν μῆνας πλήρεις τοκετοῦ, ὠδῖ-
3 νας δὲ αὐτῶν ἔλυσας; Ἐξέθρεψας δὲ αὐτῶν τὰ παιδία ἄνευ φό-
4 βου, ὠδῖνας δὲ αὐτῶν ἐξαποστελεῖς; Ἀποῤῥήξουσι τὰ τέκνα αὐ-

6 κάμψουσιν αὐτοῖς. Τίς δ᾽ ἔστιν ὁ ἀφεὶς ὄνον ἄγριον ἐλεύθερον;
7 δεσμοὺς δὲ αὐτοῦ τίς ἔλυσεν; Ἐθέμην δὲ αὐτοῦ τὴν δίαιταν ἔρη-
8 μον, καὶ τὰ σκηνώματα αὐτοῦ ἁλμυρίδα. Καταγελῶν πολυοχλίας
9 πόλεως, μέμψιν δὲ φορολόγου οὐκ ἀκούων. Κατασκέψεται ὄρη
10 νομὴν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὀπίσω παντὸς χλωροῦ ζητήσει. Βουλήσεται δὲ
    σοι (ἀτρίπελος) μονόκερως δουλεῦσαι, ἢ κοιμηθῆναι ἐπὶ φάτνης
11 σου; Δήσεις δὲ αὐτοῦ ἐν ἱμᾶσι ζυγόν; ἢ ἑλκύσει σοι αὔλακας ἐν
12 πεδίῳ; Πέποιθας δὲ ἐπ᾽ αὐτῷ, ὅτι πολλὴ ἡ ἰσχὺς αὐτοῦ; καὶ
13 ἐπαφήσεις αὐτῷ τὰ ἔργα σου; Πιστεύσεις δὲ αὐτῷ, ὅτι ἀποδώσει
14 σοι τὸν σπόρον, καὶ εἰσοίσει σου τὴν ἅλωνα; Πτέρυξ τερπομένων
    Νεέλασα, ἐὰν συλλαβῇ Ἀσίδα καὶ Νέεσσα· (ἐλάλησαν) ὅτι ἀφήσει

## CHAPTER XXXVIII.

...
**29** And who is he that hath begotten (the bands and) the clods of dew? And from whose womb doth the ice proceed?
**30** Who hath begotten the frost in heaven, or caused it to descend as flowing water?
**31** And who hast Thou made firm the face of the abyss?
**32** Or wilt thou open Mazzaroth in its season? And wilt thou lead the evening [star] and them upon its village?
**33** Knowest thou then the turnings of heaven, or the things that come to pass under heaven with one accord?
**34** And wilt thou call the cloud with thy voice, and shall it obey thee with a rush of raging water?
**35** And wilt thou send forth the thunderbolts, and shall they go? And shall they say unto thee, 'What is it?'
**36** Who hath given unto women the wisdom of weaving, and knowledge of skill in ornamental work (of wisdom)?
**37** Who then is he that numbereth the clouds with wisdom, and hath bent down the heaven unto the earth?
**38** For it is poured out like earth [made ready for] casting, and He hath fastened it with stones as a cube.
**39** Wilt thou then hunt prey for the lions? And wilt thou fill the lives of the dragons?
**40** For they lurk in their lairs; yea, they sit in the thickets lying in wait.
**41** Who then hath prepared food for the raven, when his young ones cry unto their Lord, straying and seeking for their food?

## CHAPTER XXXIX.

**1** Knowest thou the time when the rock-goats bring forth? Or hast thou observed the birth pangs of the hinds?
**2** Hast thou numbered their months full for birth, and loosed their birth pangs?
**3** Hast thou then reared their young without fear, and dost thou bring forth their pangs?
**4** Their young shall then break away [from them], they shall multiply in their offspring;
**5** They shall go forth, and shall not return unto them.
**6** Who then is he that hath let the wild ass go free? And who hath loosed his bonds?
**7** I have then appointed his dwelling a wilderness, and his tabernacles salt land.
**8** He derideth the multitude of the city, and heareth not the reproach of the tax-gatherer.
**9** He shall look upon the mountains for his pasture, and seek after every green thing.
**10** Will the (unyielding) unicorn be willing to serve thee, or to abide by thy manger?
**11** Wilt thou then bind his yoke with thongs? Or will he draw furrows for thee in the plain?
**12** Hast thou then trusted him, because his strength is great? And wilt thou commit thy labors unto him?
**13** Wilt thou then believe him, that he will restore unto thee thy seed, and bring in thy harvest?
**14** The wing of the exultant Neelas, if it shall seize Aspida and Neessa; (for they said) that it will forsake
