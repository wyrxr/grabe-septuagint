ΚΕΦ. ΙϚʹ. ΙΖʹ.
36 τηρίας ἡμῶν, καὶ ἄθροισον ἡμᾶς, καὶ ἐξελοῦ ἡμᾶς ἐκ τῶν ἐθνῶν,
τοῦ αἰνεῖν τὸ ὄνομα τὸ ἅγιόν σου, καὶ καυχᾶσθαι ἐν ταῖς αἰνέσεσί
σου. Εὐλογημένος Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραὴλ ἀπὸ τοῦ αἰῶνος καὶ ἕως
τοῦ αἰῶνος. Καὶ ἐρεῖ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς, ἀμήν. Καὶ ἤνεσαν τῷ Κυρίῳ.
37 Καὶ κατέλιπεν ἐκεῖ ἐναντίον τῆς κιβωτοῦ διαθήκης Κυρίου τὸν
Ἀσάφ, καὶ τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ, τοῦ λειτουργεῖν ἐναντίον τῆς κιβω-
38 τοῦ διαπαντὸς τὸ τῆς ἡμέρας εἰς ἡμέραν. Καὶ Ἀβδεδδὸμ, καὶ οἱ
ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ ἑξήκοντα καὶ ὀκτώ· καὶ Ἀβδεδδὸμ υἱὸς Ἰδιθοὺν, καὶ
39 Ὠσηὲ εἰς πυλωρούς. Καὶ τὸν Σαδὼκ τὸν ἱερέα, καὶ τοὺς ἀδελ-
φοὺς αὐτοῦ τοὺς ἱερεῖς, ἐναντίον σκηνῆς Κυρίου ἐν Βαμὰ τῇ ἐν Γα-
40 βαὼν, τοῦ ἀναφέρειν ὁλοκαυτώματα τῷ Κυρίῳ ἐπὶ τοῦ θυσιαστη-
ρίου τῶν ὁλοκαυτωμάτων διαπαντὸς τοπρωΐ καὶ τοεσπέρας, καὶ
κατὰ πάντα τὰ γεγραμμένα ἐν νόμῳ Κυρίου, ὅσα ἐνετείλατο ἐφ᾿
41 υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ ἐν χειρὶ Μωυσῆ τοῦ θεράποντος τοῦ Θεοῦ. Καὶ
μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ Αἰμὰν, καὶ Ἰδιθοὺν, καὶ οἱ λοιποὶ ἐκλεγέντες ἐπ᾿ ὀνό-
ματος τοῦ αἰνεῖν τὸν Κύριον, ὅτι εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ·
42 καὶ μετ᾿ αὐτῶν σάλπιγγες, καὶ κύμβαλα τοῦ ἀναφωνεῖν, καὶ ὄρ-
43 γανα τῶν ᾠδῶν τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰδιθοὺν εἰς τὴν πύλην. Καὶ
ἐπορεύθη πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ἕκαστος εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπέστρεψε
Δαυὶδ τοῦ εὐλογῆσαι τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΖʹ. XVII.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο ὡς κατώκησε Δαυὶδ ἐν οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπε
Δαυὶδ πρὸς Νάθαν τὸν προφήτην· Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ κατοικῶ ἐν οἴκῳ κε-
2 δρίνῳ, καὶ ἡ κιβωτὸς διαθήκης Κυρίου ὑποκάτω δέρρεων. Καὶ εἶ-
πε Νάθαν πρὸς Δαυίδ· πᾶν τὸ ἐν τῇ ψυχῇ σου ποίει, ὅτι ὁ Θεὸς
3 μετὰ σοῦ. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῇ νυκτὶ ἐκείνῃ, καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυ-
4 ρίου πρὸς Νάθαν, λέγων πορεύου, καὶ εἰπὸν πρὸς Δαυὶδ τὸν παῖ-
δά μου· οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος· οὐ σὺ οἰκοδομήσεις μοι οἶκον τοῦ κατ-
5 οικῆσαί με ἐν αὐτῷ· ὅτι οὐ κατῴκησα ἐν οἴκῳ ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέρας ἧς
ἀνήγαγον τὸν Ἰσραὴλ ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης, καὶ ἤμην ἐν σκηνῇ,
6 καὶ ἐν καταλύματι. Ἐν πᾶσιν οἷς διῆλθον ἐν παντὶ Ἰσραὴλ, εἰ
λαλῶν ἐλάλησα πρὸς μίαν φυλὴν Ἰσραὴλ, (ἑνὶ τῶν κριτῶν Ἰσραὴλ,)
οἷς ἐνετειλάμην τοῦ ποιμαίνειν τὸν λαόν μου, λέγων· ὅτι οὐκ ᾠκο-
7 δομήκατέ μοι οἶκον κέδρινον; καὶ νῦν οὕτως ἐρεῖς τῷ δούλῳ μου

**Chapter 16**

**36** —vation, and gather us, and deliver us from among the nations, that we may praise Thy holy Name, and glory in Thy praises. Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, from everlasting and to everlasting. And all the people shall say, Amen. And they praised the Lord.

**37** And there he left before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, [performing] the service of each day.

**38** And Obed-Edom, and his brethren, three score and eight; and Obed-Edom the son of Jeduthun, and Hosah, for doorkeepers.

**39** And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the Lord in Bamah, which is in Gibeon,

**40** To offer burnt offerings unto the Lord upon the altar of burnt offerings continually, both in the morning and in the evening, and according to all things written in the Law of the Lord, as many as He commanded upon the sons of Israel by the hand of Moses the servant of God.

**41** And with him, Heman, and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen by name, to praise the Lord, because His mercy endureth forever;

**42** And with them, trumpets and cymbals for sounding aloud, and instruments for the songs of God, and the sons of Jeduthun for the gate.

**43** And all the people departed every man to his own house; and David returned to bless his house.

**Chapter 17**

**1** And it came to pass, when David dwelt in his own house, that David said unto Nathan the prophet, "Behold, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of the Lord dwelleth beneath skins."

**2** Then Nathan said unto David, "Do all that is in thine heart, for God is with thee."

**3** And it came to pass in that night, that the word of the Lord came to Nathan, saying,

**4** "Go and speak unto David My servant, saying, 'Thus saith the Lord: Thou shalt not build Me an house to dwell in.

**5** For I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel until this day, but have been in a tent, and in a tabernacle.

**6** In all the places wherein I have walked among all Israel, spake I a word to any one of the tribes of Israel (or to one of the judges of Israel), whom I commanded to shepherd My people, saying, "Why have ye not built Me an house of cedar?"'

**7** Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto My servant David,"
