Ἀσὰφ ἐν κυμβάλοις τοῦ αἰνεῖν τὸν Κύριον ἐπὶ χεῖρας Δαυὶδ βα-
σιλέως Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἀπεκρίθησαν ἐν αἴνῳ καὶ ἀνθομολογήσει τῷ **11**
Κυρίῳ, ὅτι ἀγαθόν, ὅτι εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ.
Καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ἐσήμανε φωνῇ μεγάλῃ αἰνεῖν τῷ Κυρίῳ ἐπὶ τῇ θε-
μελιώσει οἴκου Κυρίου. Καὶ πολλοὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ἱερέων καὶ τῶν Λευι- **12**
τῶν καὶ ἄρχοντες τῶν πατριῶν οἱ πρεσβύτεροι, οἳ εἴδοσαν τὸν οἶ-
κον τὸν πρῶτον ἐν θεμελιώσει αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοῦτον τὸν οἶκον ἐν ὀφ-
θαλμοῖς ἑαυτῶν, ἔκλαιον φωνῇ μεγάλῃ, καὶ ὁ ὄχλος ἐν Σημασίᾳ
μετ᾽ εὐφροσύνης τοῦ ὑψῶσαι ᾠδήν. Καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ λαὸς ἐπιγινώ- **13**
σκων τὴν φωνὴν Σημασίας τῆς εὐφροσύνης ἀπὸ τῆς φωνῆς τοῦ
κλαυθμοῦ τοῦ λαοῦ, ὅτι ὁ λαὸς ἐκραύγασε φωνῇ μεγάλῃ, καὶ ἡ
φωνὴ ἠκούετο ἕως ἀπὸ μακρόθεν.

ΚΑΙ ἤκουσαν οἱ θλίβοντες Ἰούδα καὶ Βενιαμείν, ὅτι υἱοὶ τῆς **1**
ἀποικίας οἰκοδομοῦσιν οἶκον τῷ Κυρίῳ Θεῷ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἤγγισαν **2**
πρὸς Ζοροβάβελ καὶ πρὸς τοὺς ἄρχοντας τῶν πατριῶν, καὶ εἶπον
αὐτοῖς· οἰκοδομήσομεν μεθ᾽ ὑμῶν, ὅτι ὡς ὑμεῖς ἐκζητοῦμεν τῷ Θεῷ
ὑμῶν, καὶ αὐτῷ ἡμεῖς θυσιάζομεν ἀπὸ ἡμερῶν Ἀσαραδδὼν βασι-
λέως Ἀσσοὺρ τοῦ ἐνέγκαντος ἡμᾶς ὧδε. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτοὺς **3**
Ζοροβάβελ καὶ Ἰησοῦς καὶ οἱ κατάλοιποι τῶν ἀρχόντων τῶν πα-
τριῶν τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, οὐχ ἡμῖν καὶ ὑμῖν τοῦ οἰκοδομῆσαι οἶκον τῷ
Θεῷ ὑμῶν, ὅτι ἡμεῖς αὐτοὶ ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ οἰκοδομήσομεν τῷ Κυρίῳ
Θεῷ ἡμῶν, ὡς ἐνετείλατο ἡμῖν Κῦρος ὁ βασιλεὺς Περσῶν. Καὶ **4**
ἦν ὁ λαὸς τῆς γῆς ἐκλύων τὰς χεῖρας τοῦ λαοῦ Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐνεπό-
διζον αὐτοὺς τοῦ οἰκοδομεῖν, καὶ μισθούμενοι ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς βουλευό- **5**
μενοι τοῦ διασκεδάσαι βουλὴν αὐτῶν πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας Κύρου βα-
σιλέως Περσῶν, καὶ ἕως βασιλείας Δαρείου βασιλέως Περσῶν. Καὶ **6**
ἐν βασιλείᾳ Ἀσσουήρου (Περσῶν) καὶ ἐν ἀρχῇ βασιλείας αὐτοῦ
ἔγραφαν ἐπιστολὴν ἐπὶ οἰκοῦντας Ἰούδα καὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ ἐν **7**
ἡμέραις Ἀρθασασθὰ ἔγραφεν ἐν εἰρήνῃ Μιθραδάτης Ταβεὴλ σὺν
καὶ τοῖς λοιποῖς συνδούλοις αὐτοῦ, πρὸς Ἀρθασασθὰ βασιλέα Περ-
σῶν ἔγραφεν ὁ φορολόγος γραφὴν Συριστεὶ καὶ ἡρμηνευμένην.
Ῥεοὺμ Βααλτὰμ καὶ Σαμψαὶ ὁ γραμματεὺς ἔγραφαν ἐπιστολὴν μίαν **8**
κατὰ Ἱερουσαλὴμ τῷ Ἀρθασασθὰ βασιλεῖ.
Τάδε ἔκρινε Ῥεοὺμ **9**

¹⁰ Asaph, with cymbals, to praise the Lord according to the directions of David, king of Israel.
¹¹ And they answered, giving praise and thanksgiving unto the Lord, [saying], "For He is good, for His mercy endureth forever upon Israel!" And all the people did shout with a great voice to praise the Lord upon the laying of the foundation of the house of the Lord.
¹² And many of the priests and the Levites, and the chief fathers, the elders, who had seen the first house in its foundation, and [now saw] this house with their own eyes, did weep with a great voice; and the multitude, with an outward expression of joy, did lift up a song.
¹³ And the people could not discern the voice of the outward expression of joy from the voice of the weeping of the people, for the people did shout with a great voice, and the voice was heard even from afar.

² then they drew near unto Zerubbabel and unto the heads of the fathers’ houses, and said unto them, "We will build with you; for as ye do seek your God, even so do we seek Him, and unto Him do we sacrifice since the days of Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, who brought us up hither."
³ But Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the rest of the heads of the fathers’ houses of Israel said unto them, "It is not for us and for you to build a house unto our God; for we ourselves alone will build unto the Lord our God, as Cyrus the king of Persia commanded us."

⁶ And in the reign of Ahasuerus (of Persia), and in the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.
⁷ And in the days of Artaxerxes, Mithradates [and] Tabeel, with the rest of their fellow servants, did write [a letter] with salutations of peace; [and] to Artaxerxes the king of Persia, the tax-collector did write a letter in the Aramaic tongue and [fully] interpreted.
