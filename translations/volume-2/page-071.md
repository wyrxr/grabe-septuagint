παιξάτωσαν ἐνώπιον ἡμῶν. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰωάβ· ἀναστήτωσαν. Καὶ 15
ἀνέστησαν καὶ παρῆλθον ἐν ἀριθμῷ τῶν παίδων Βενιαμεὶν δώδε-
κα τῷ Ἰσοβοσθὲ υἱοῦ Σαούλ, καὶ δώδεκα ἐκ τῶν παίδων Δαυίδ.
Καὶ ἐκράτησαν ἕκαστος τῇ χειρὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν τοῦ πλησίον αὐ- 16
τοῦ, καὶ μάχαιρα αὐτοῦ εἰς πλάγιον τοῦ πλησίον αὐτοῦ, καὶ πί-
πτουσι κατὰ τὸ αὐτό. Καὶ ἐκλήθη τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ τόπου ἐκείνου,
Μέρις τῶν ἐπιβούλων, ἢ ἔστιν ἐν Γαβαών. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὁ πόλε- 17
μος σκληρὸς ὥστε λίαν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ. Καὶ ἔπαισεν Ἀβεν-
νὴρ καὶ ἄνδρες Ἰσραὴλ ἐνώπιον τῶν παίδων Δαυίδ. Καὶ ἐγένον- 18
το ἐκεῖ τρεῖς υἱοὶ Σαρουίας, Ἰωάβ, καὶ Ἀβισαί, καὶ Ἀσαήλ. Καὶ
Ἀσαὴλ κοῦφος τοῖς ποσὶν αὐτοῦ, ὡσεὶ μία δορκὰς ἐν ἀγρῷ. Καὶ 19
κατεδίωξεν Ἀσαὴλ ὀπίσω Ἀβεννήρ, καὶ οὐκ ἐξέκλινε τοῦ πορεύ-
εσθαι εἰς τὰ δεξιὰ οὐδὲ εἰς τὰ ἀριστερὰ κατόπισθεν Ἀβεννήρ.
Καὶ ἐπέβλεψεν Ἀβεννὴρ εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπεν· εἶ σὺ 20
αὐτὸς Ἀσαήλ; καὶ εἶπεν (αὐτῷ)· ἐγὼ εἰμι· καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Ἀ- 21
βεννήρ· ἔκκλινον σὺ εἰς δεξιὰ ἢ εἰς τὰ ἀριστερὰ, καὶ κατάσχε
σεαυτῷ ἐν τῶν παιδαρίων, καὶ λαβὲ σεαυτῷ τὴν πανοπλίαν αὐτοῦ.
Καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησεν Ἀσαὴλ ἐκκλίνειν ἐκ τῶν ὄπισθεν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ 22
προσέθετο ἔτι Ἀβεννὴρ λέγων τῷ Ἀσαήλ· ἀπόστηθι ἀπ᾽ ἐμοῦ,
ἵνα μὴ πατάξω σε εἰς τὴν γῆν· καὶ πῶς ἀρῶ τὸ πρόσωπόν μου
πρὸς Ἰωάβ; Καὶ ποῦ ἐστι ταῦτα; ἀπόστρεφε πρὸς Ἰωάβ τὸν ἀ- 23
δελφόν σου. Καὶ οὐκ ἐβούλετο τοῦ ἀποστῆναι. Καὶ τύπτει αὐ-
τὸν Ἀβεννὴρ ἐν τῷ ὀπίσω τοῦ δόρατος ἐπὶ τὴν ψόαν, καὶ ἐξῆλ-
θε τὸ δόρυ ἐκ τῶν ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ, καὶ πίπτει ἐκεῖ, καὶ ἀποθνή-
σκει ὑποκάτω αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐγένετο πᾶς ὁ ἐρχόμενος ἕως τοῦ τό-
που, οὗ ἔπεσεν ἐκεῖ Ἀσαὴλ καὶ ἀπέθανε, καὶ ὑφίστατο. Καὶ κα- 24
τεδίωξεν Ἰωάβ καὶ Ἀβισαί ὀπίσω Ἀβεννήρ, καὶ ὁ ἥλιος ἔδυνε.
Καὶ αὐτοὶ εἰσῆλθον ἕως τοῦ βουνοῦ Ἀμμά, ὃ ἔστιν ἐπὶ προσώ-
που Γαι, ὁδὸν ἔρημον Γαβαών. Καὶ συναθροίζονται υἱοὶ Βενιαμεὶν 25
οἱ ὀπίσω Ἀβεννήρ, καὶ ἐγεννήθησαν εἰς συνάντησιν μίαν, καὶ ἔ-
στησαν ἐπὶ κεφαλὴν βουνοῦ ἑνός. Καὶ ἐκάλεσεν Ἀβεννὴρ Ἰωάβ, 26
καὶ εἶπεν· μὴ εἰς νῖκος καταφάγεται ῥομφαία; ἢ οὐκ οἶδας ὅτι
πικρὰ ἔσται εἰς τὰ ἔσχατα; καὶ ἕως πότε οὐ μὴ εἴπῃς τῷ λαῷ
ἀποστρέφειν ἀπὸ ὄπισθεν τῶν ἀδελφῶν ἡμῶν; Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰωάβ· 27
Ζῇ Κύριος, ὅτι εἰ μὴ ἐλάλησας, διότι τότε ἐκ πρωΐθεν ἀνέβη ὁ
λαὸς, ἕκαστος κατόπισθεν τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐσάλπισεν 28

**14** "Let them now play before us." And Joab said, "Let them arise."

**15** So there arose and went over, by number, twelve of the young men of Benjamin for Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, and twelve of the young men of David.

**16** And each one caught his fellow by the head with his hand, and thrust his sword into his fellow's side; so they fell down together in that same moment. And the name of that place was called, "The Portion of the Plotters," which is in Gibeon.

**17** And there was a very fierce battle that day. And Abner and the men of Israel were smitten before the young men of David.

**18** And there were three sons of Zeruiah present: Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel. And Asahel was swift of foot, as a wild roe in the field.

**19** And Asahel pursued after Abner, and turned not aside from following Abner, neither to the right hand nor to the left.

**20** Then Abner looked behind him, and said, "Art thou Asahel himself?" And he said (unto him), "I am."

**21** And Abner said unto him, "Turn thee aside to the right hand, or to the left, and lay hold for thyself *among* the young men, and take their armor for thyself."

**22** Yet Asahel would not turn aside from behind him. And Abner spoke yet again to Asahel, saying, "Turn thee aside from me, lest I smite thee to the ground. For how then shall I lift up my face to Joab?"

**23** "And wherefore are these things? Turn back now to Joab thy brother." But he would not turn aside. So Abner smote him with the hinder end of the spear upon the loins, and the spear came out behind him. And he fell down there and died beneath it. And it came to pass that every man who came unto the place where Asahel had fallen down and died, stood still.

**24** Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner, and the sun did set. And they came unto the hill of Ammah, which is before Gai, by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.

**25** And the sons of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and were born into one assembly, and stood on the top of one hill.

**26** Then Abner called to Joab, and said, "Shall the sword devour for ever? Or knowest thou not that it will be bitter in the end? How long then wilt thou not command the people to return from following their brethren?"

**27** And Joab said, "As the Lord liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, then surely from the morning the people would have gone up, each one from following his brother."

**28** So Joab blew the trumpet,
