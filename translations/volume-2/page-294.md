¹⁶ πέντε τὸ ὕψος, καὶ τὰς κεφαλὰς αὐτῶν πήχεων πέντε. Καὶ ἐποίησε Σερσερὼθ ἐν τῷ Δαβείρ, καὶ ἔδωκεν ἐπὶ τῶν κεφαλῶν τῶν στύλων, καὶ ἐποίησε ῥοίσκους ἑκατόν, καὶ ἔθηκεν ἐπὶ τῶν χαλαστῶν.
¹⁷ Καὶ ἔστησε τοὺς στύλους κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ ναοῦ, ἕνα ἐκ δεξιῶν, καὶ ἕνα ἐξ εὐωνύμων, καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ ἐκ δεξιῶν, Κατόρθωσις, καὶ τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ ἐξ ἀριστερῶν, Ἰσχύς.

ΚΕΦ. Δ΄. IV.

¹ ΚΑΙ ἐποίησε τὸ θυσιαστήριον χαλκοῦν, εἴκοσι πήχεων μῆκος,
² καὶ εἴκοσι πήχεων τὸ εὖρος, καὶ πήχεων δέκα τὸ ὕψος. Καὶ ἐποίησε τὴν θάλασσαν χυτήν, πήχεων δέκα τὴν διαμέτρησιν, στρογγύλην κυκλόθεν, καὶ πέντε πήχεων τὸ ὕψος, καὶ τὸ κύκλωμα πήχεων
³ τριάκοντα· καὶ ὁμοίωμα μόσχων ὑποκάτωθεν αὐτῆς, κύκλῳ κυκλοῦσιν αὐτήν· δέκα πήχεις περιέχουσι τὸν λουτῆρα κυκλόθεν·
⁴ δύο γένη ἐχώνευσαν τοὺς μόσχους ἐν τῇ χωνεύσει αὐτῶν· ἦ ἐποίησαν αὐτοὺς δώδεκα μόσχους, οἱ τρεῖς βλέποντες βορρᾶν, καὶ οἱ τρεῖς βλέποντες δυσμάς, καὶ οἱ τρεῖς βλέποντες νότον, καὶ οἱ τρεῖς βλέποντες κατὰ ἀνατολάς, καὶ ἡ θάλασσα ἐπ᾿ αὐτῶν ἄνω, ἦσαν τὰ
⁵ ὀπίσθια αὐτῶν ἔσω· καὶ τὸ πάχος αὐτῆς παλαιστῆς, καὶ τὸ χεῖλος αὐτῆς, ὡς χεῖλος ποτηρίου, διαγεγλυμμένα βλαστούς κρίνου,
⁶ χωροῦσα μετρητὰς τρισχιλίους, καὶ ἐξετέλεσε. Καὶ ἐποίησε λουτῆρας δέκα, καὶ ἐπέθηκε τοὺς πέντε ἐκ δεξιῶν, καὶ τοὺς πέντε ἐξ ἀριστερῶν, τοῦ πλύνειν ἐν αὐτοῖς τὰ ἔργα τῶν ὁλοκαυτωμάτων, καὶ ἀποκλύζειν ἐν αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἡ θάλασσα εἰς τὸ νίπτεσθαι τοὺς ἱερεῖς ἐν αὐτῇ.
⁷ Καὶ ἐποίησε τὰς λυχνίας τὰς χρυσᾶς δέκα κατὰ τὸ κρίμα αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔθηκεν ἐν τῷ ναῷ, πέντε ἐκ δεξιῶν, καὶ πέντε
⁸ ἐξ ἀριστερῶν. Καὶ ἐποίησε τραπέζας δέκα, καὶ ἔθηκεν ἐν τῷ ναῷ, πέντε ἐκ δεξιῶν, καὶ πέντε ἐξ εὐωνύμων, καὶ ἐποίησε φιάλας χρυσᾶς ἑκατόν,
⁹ καὶ ἐποίησε τὴν αὐλὴν τῶν ἱερέων, καὶ τὴν αὐλὴν τὴν μεγάλην, καὶ τὰς θύρας τῇ αὐλῇ, καὶ θυρώματα φϋτῶν κατακεχαλκωμένα χαλκῷ.
¹⁰ Καὶ τὴν θάλασσαν ἔθηκεν ἀπὸ γωνίας τοῦ
¹¹ οἴκου ἐκ δεξιῶν ὡς πρὸς ἀνατολὰς κατέναντι. Καὶ ἐποίησε Χειρὰμ τὰς κρεάγρας, καὶ τὰ πυρεῖα, καὶ τὴν ἐσχάραν τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου, καὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ· καὶ συντετέλεσε Χειρὰμ ποιῆσαι πᾶσαν τὴν ἐργασίαν ἣν ἐποίησε τῷ βασιλεῖ Σαλωμὼν ἐν οἴκῳ τοῦ [Θεοῦ].

**The Second Book of Chronicles**
**CHAPTER 3**

¹⁶ five cubits in height; and their capitals five cubits. And he made Ser-seroth within the Oracle, and he placed them upon the capitals of the pillars; and he made an hundred pomegranates, and put them upon the garlands.
¹⁷ And he set up the pillars before the Temple, one on the right hand, and one on the left; and he called the name of that on the right hand, Katorthosis [Establishment], and the name of that on the left, Ischys [Strength].

**CHAPTER 4**

¹ And he made an altar of bronze, twenty cubits in length,
² and twenty cubits in breadth, and ten cubits in height. And he made the molten Sea, ten cubits in its diameter, round about, and five cubits in height, and its circumference
³ thirty cubits. And a likeness of calves was beneath it, encircling it round about; ten cubits did encompass the laver round about.
⁴ Two kinds cast the calves in their casting; or, they made them twelve calves: three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the Sea was set above them, and their hinder parts were inward.
⁵ And its thickness was a handbreadth; and its brim was as the brim of a cup, carved [with] lily blossoms,
⁶ containing three thousand baths; and he finished it. And he made ten lavers, and he set five on the right hand, and five on the left, for the washing therein of the work of the burnt offerings, and for rinsing therein; and the Sea was for the priests to wash themselves in it.
⁷ And he made the ten golden lampstands, according to their ordinance, and he placed them in the Temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.
⁸ And he made ten tables, and placed them in the Temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left; and he made an hundred golden bowls.
⁹ And he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and the doors for the court, and wooden door-frames overlaid with bronze.
¹⁰ And he set the Sea from the right corner of the house,
¹¹ eastward, over against [it]. And Huram made the flesh-hooks, and the firepans, and the grate of the altar, and all the vessels thereof. And Huram finished to make all the work which he made for King Solomon in the House of [God].
