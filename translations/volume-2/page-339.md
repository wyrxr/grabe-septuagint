ΚΕΦ. ΛΑ΄. ΤΩΝ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ ΙΟΥΔΑ Β΄. 815
καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς ἐδέχοντο τὰ αἵματα ἐκ χειρὸς τῶν Λευιτῶν. Ὅτι 17
πλῆθος τῆς ἐκκλησίας οὐχ ἡγνίσθη, καὶ οἱ Λευῖται ἦσαν τοῦ θύειν
τὸ Φασὲκ παντὶ τῷ μὴ δυναμένῳ ἁγνισθῆναι τῷ Κυρίῳ· ὅτι τὸ 18
πλεῖστον τοῦ λαοῦ ἀπὸ Ἐφραΐμ, καὶ Μανασσῆ, καὶ Ἰσσάχαρ, καὶ
Ζαβουλὼν οὐχ ἡγνίσθησαν, ἀλλὰ ἔφαγον τὸ Φασὲκ παρὰ τὴν γρα-
φήν. Καὶ προσηύξατο Ἑζεκίας περὶ αὐτῶν λέγων· Κύριος ὁ ἀγα-
θὸς ἐξιλάσθω, ὑπὲρ πάσης καρδίας κατευθυνούσης ἐκζητῆσαι Κύ- 19
ριον τὸν Θεὸν τῶν πατέρων ἑαυτοῦ, καὶ οὐ κατὰ τὴν ἁγνείαν τῶν
ἁγίων. Καὶ ἐπήκουσε Κύριος τῷ Ἑζεκία, καὶ ἰάσατο τὸν λαόν. 20
Καὶ ἐποίησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ οἱ εὑρεθέντες ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ τὴν 21
ἑορτὴν τῶν ἀζύμων ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας ἐν εὐφροσύνῃ μεγάλῃ, καὶ καθυμνοῦντες
τῷ Κυρίῳ ἡμέραν καθ᾿ ἡμέραν, καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς καὶ οἱ Λευῖ-
ται ἐν ὀργάνοις τῷ Κυρίῳ. Καὶ ἐλάλησεν Ἑζεκίας ἐπὶ πᾶσαν καρ- 22
δίαν τῶν Λευιτῶν, καὶ τῶν συνιόντων σύνεσιν ἀγαθὴν τῷ Κυρίῳ·
καὶ συνετέλεσαν τὴν ἑορτὴν τῶν ἀζύμων ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας θύοντες θυ-
σίας σωτηρίου, καὶ ἐξομολογούμενοι τῷ Κυρίῳ Θεῷ τῶν πατέρων
ἑαυτῶν. Καὶ ἐβουλεύσατο ἡ ἐκκλησία ἅμα ποιῆσαι ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας 23
ἄλλας· καὶ ἐποίησαν ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας ἐν εὐφροσύνῃ. Ὅτι Ἑζεκίας ἀπ- 24
ήρξατο τῷ Ἰούδα, τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ μόσχους χιλίους καὶ ἑπτακισχίλια
πρόβατα, καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες ἀπήρξαντο τῷ λαῷ μόσχους χιλίους,
καὶ πρόβατα δέκα χιλιάδας, καὶ τὰ ἅγια τῶν ἱερέων εἰς πλῆθος.
Καὶ ηὐφράνθη πᾶσα ἡ ἐκκλησία, οἱ ἱερεῖς καὶ οἱ Λευῖται, καὶ πᾶ- 25
σα ἡ ἐκκλησία Ἰούδα, καὶ οἱ εὑρεθέντες ἐξ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ οἱ προσήλυ-
τοι οἱ ἐλθόντες ἀπὸ γῆς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ οἱ κατοικοῦντες ἐν Ἰούδα.
Καὶ ἐγένετο εὐφροσύνη μεγάλη ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ· ἀπὸ τῶν ἡμερῶν 26
τοῦ Σαλωμὼν υἱοῦ Δαυὶδ βασιλέως Ἰσραὴλ οὐκ ἐγένετο τοιαύτη
ἑορτὴ ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ ἀνέστησαν οἱ ἱερεῖς καὶ οἱ Λευῖται, καὶ 27
ηὐλόγησαν τὸν λαόν, καὶ ἐπηκούσθη ἡ φωνὴ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἦλθεν ἡ
προσευχὴ αὐτῶν εἰς τὸ κατοικητήριον τὸ ἅγιον αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν.

ΚΕΦ. ΛΑ΄. ΧΧΧΙ.

ΚΑΙ ὡς συνετελέσθη πάντα ταῦτα, ἐξῆλθε πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ οἱ 1
εὑρεθέντες ἐν πόλεσιν Ἰούδα, καὶ συνέτριψαν τὰς στήλας, καὶ ἐξέκο-
ψαν τὰ ἄλση, καὶ κατέσπασαν τὰ ὑψηλά, καὶ τοὺς βωμοὺς ἀπὸ
πάσης Ἰουδαίας καὶ Βενιαμείν, καὶ ἐξ Ἐφραΐμ, καὶ ἀπὸ Μανασσῆ

### English Translation

### Chapter 31

¹⁷ And the priests received the bloods from the hand of the Levites. For a multitude of the congregation was not sanctified; therefore the Levites were to slay the Passover for all them that could not sanctify themselves unto the Lord. ¹⁸ For the most part of the people, from Ephraim, and Manasseh, and Issachar, and Zebulun, were not sanctified, but they ate the Passover contrary to the Scripture. ¹⁹ And Hezekiah prayed concerning them, saying, "May the good Lord be propitious, for every heart that directeth itself to seek the Lord, the God of his fathers, and not according to the purity of the holy [rites]." ²⁰ And the Lord heard Hezekiah, and healed the people.

²¹ And the sons of Israel that were found in Jerusalem kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with great gladness; and they sang praise unto the Lord day by day, both the priests and the Levites, with instruments unto the Lord. ²² And Hezekiah spoke to the heart of all the Levites, and of them that were endowed with good understanding unto the Lord; and they completed the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days, sacrificing peace offerings, and giving praise unto the Lord God of their fathers.

²³ And the assembly resolved together to keep another seven days; and they kept seven days with gladness. ²⁴ For Hezekiah offered unto Judah, unto the assembly, a thousand calves and seven thousand sheep; and the princes offered unto the people a thousand calves and ten thousand sheep, and the holy portions of the priests in abundance.

²⁵ And all the assembly rejoiced, both the priests and the Levites, and all the assembly of Judah, and those who were found from Israel, and the proselytes who had come out of the land of Israel, and those who dwelt in Judah. ²⁶ And there was great gladness in Jerusalem; for since the days of Solomon, the son of David, King of Israel, there had not been such a feast in Jerusalem.

²⁷ And the priests and the Levites arose and blessed the people; and their voice was heard, and their prayer came into His holy habitation, even unto heaven.

### Chapter 31

¹ And when all these things were finished, all Israel who were found in the cities of Judah went out, and they broke in pieces the pillars, and cut down the groves, and pulled down the high places, and the altars from all Judea and Benjamin, and from Ephraim, and from Manasseh,
