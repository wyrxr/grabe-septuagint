ΚΕΦ. ΚΗ'. ΚΘ'. ΤΩΝ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ ΙΟΥΔΑ Β'. 811
27 Καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Ἄχαζ μετὰ τῶν πατέρων ἑαυτοῦ, καὶ ἐτάφη ἐν πόλει Δαυΐδ, ὅτι οὐκ εἰσήνεγκαν αὐτὸν εἰς τοὺς τάφους τῶν βασιλέων Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Ἑζεκίας υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΘ'. ΧΧΙΧ.

1 ΚΑΙ Ἑζεκίας ἐβασίλευσεν ὧν εἴκοσι καὶ πέντε ἐτῶν, καὶ εἴκοσι ἐννέα ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ὄνομα τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ Ἀβιὰ, θυγάτηρ Ζαχαρίου.
2 Καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ εὐθὲς ἐνώπιον Κυρίου, κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησε Δαυΐδ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ.
3 Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἔστη ἐπὶ τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ, ἐν τῷ πρώτῳ μηνὶ ἀνέωξε τὰς θύρας οἴκου Κυρίου, καὶ ἐπεσκεύασεν αὐτάς.
4 Καὶ εἰσήγαγε τοὺς ἱερεῖς καὶ τοὺς Λευΐτας, καὶ κατέστησεν αὐτοὺς εἰς τὸ κλίτος τὸ πρὸς ἀνατολὰς, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς·
5 ἀκούσατε οἱ Λευῖται, νῦν ἁγνίσθητε, καὶ ἁγνίσατε τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου Θεοῦ πατέρων ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐκβάλετε τὴν ἀκαθαρσίαν ἐκ τῶν ἁγίων.
6 Ὅτι ἀπέστησαν οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν, καὶ ἐποίησαν τὸ πονηρὸν ἐναντίον Κυρίου Θεοῦ ἡμῶν, καὶ ἐγκατέλιπον αὐτὸν, καὶ ἀπέστρεψαν τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτῶν ἀπὸ τῆς σκηνῆς Κυρίου, καὶ ἔδωκαν αὐχένα.
7 Καὶ ἀπέκλεισαν τὰς θύρας τοῦ ναοῦ, καὶ ἔσβεσαν τοὺς λύχνους, καὶ θυμίαμα οὐκ ἐθυμίασαν, καὶ ὁλοκαυτώματα οὐ προσήνεγκαν ἐν τῷ ἁγίῳ, Θεῷ Ἰσραήλ.
8 Καὶ ὠργίσθη θυμῷ Κύριος ἐπὶ τὸν Ἰούδαν καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτοὺς εἰς ἔκστασιν, καὶ εἰς ἀφανισμὸν, καὶ εἰς συριγμὸν, ὡς ὑμεῖς ὁρᾶτε τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς ὑμῶν.
9 Καὶ ἰδοὺ πεπλήγασιν οἱ πατέρες ὑμῶν ἐν μαχαίρᾳ, καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ ὑμῶν, καὶ αἱ θυγατέρες ὑμῶν, καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες ὑμῶν ἐν αἰχμαλωσίᾳ ἐν γῇ οὐχ αὐτῶν, ὃ καὶ νῦν ἐστιν.
10 Ἐπὶ τούτοις νῦν ἐστιν ἐπὶ καρδίας διαθέσθαι διαθήκην μου, διαθήκην Κυρίου Θεοῦ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἀποστρέψει τὴν ὀργὴν τοῦ θυμοῦ αὐτοῦ ἀφ᾿ ἡμῶν.
11 Καὶ νῦν μὴ διαλίπητε, ὅτι ἐν ὑμῖν ἡρέτικε Κύριος στῆναι ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ λειτουργεῖν, καὶ εἶναι αὐτῷ λειτουργοῦντας καὶ θυμιῶντας.
12 Καὶ ἀνέστησαν οἱ Λευῖται, Μαὰθ ὁ τοῦ Ἀμασὶ, καὶ Ἰωὴλ ὁ τοῦ Ἀζαρίου ἐκ τῶν υἱῶν Καὰθ· καὶ ἐκ τῶν υἱῶν Μεραρὶ, Κεὶς ὁ τοῦ Ἀβδὶ, καὶ Ἀζαρίας ὁ τοῦ Ἰαλλήλ· καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν Γεδσὼν, Ἰωὰ ὁ τοῦ Ζεμμὰθ καὶ Ἰωαδὰν ὁ τοῦ Ἰωαχά·
13 Καὶ τῶν υἱῶν Ἐλισαφὰν, Ζαμβρὶ, καὶ Ἰεϊὴλ·

### English Translation

### Chapter 28

²⁷ And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David, because they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel; and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.

### Chapter 29

¹ And Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old, and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Abia, the daughter of Zacharias.

² And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that David his father had done.

³ And it came to pass, as he was established in his reign, that in the first month he opened the doors of the house of the Lord, and repaired them.

⁴ And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the eastern quarter, and said unto them,

⁵ "Hearken, ye Levites, now sanctify yourselves, and sanctify the house of the Lord God of your fathers, and cast forth the uncleanness out of the holy [places].

⁶ For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the sight of the Lord our God, and have forsaken Him; and they have turned away their faces from the tabernacle of the Lord, and have offered [a] stiff neck.

⁷ And they have shut up the doors of the temple, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense, nor offered burnt offerings in the holy [place], unto the God of Israel.

⁸ Wherefore the wrath of the Lord was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and He hath delivered them into a terror, and into a ruination, and into a byword, as ye see with your own eyes.

⁹ For lo, our fathers are fallen by the sword, and our sons, and our daughters, and our wives, are in captivity in a land not their own; which [state] is even unto this day.

¹⁰ Now upon these things, it is in mine heart to make my covenant, even the covenant of the Lord God of Israel, that His fierce wrath may turn away from us.

¹¹ And now, be ye not negligent: for the Lord hath chosen you to stand before Him, to minister unto Him, and that ye should be His ministers and burn incense."

¹² Then the Levites arose: Maath the son of Amasi, and Joell the son of Azariah, of the sons of Kohath; and of the sons of Merari, Keis the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jalleel; and of the sons of Gedson, Joah the son of Zemmath, and Joadan the son of Joacha;

¹³ And of the sons of Elisaphan, Zambri, and Jeiel.
