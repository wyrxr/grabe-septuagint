**ΚΕΦ. Ϛ΄. VI.**

**23** γὰρ ἄγριοι εἰρηνεύσουσί σοι, ὅτι μετὰ τῶν λίθων τοῦ ἀγροῦ ἡ διαθήκη σου, καὶ τὰ θηρία τοῦ ἀγροῦ εἰρηνεύσει σοι.
**24** Καὶ γνώσῃ ὅτι ἐν εἰρήνῃ τὸ σπέρμα σου καὶ ἐπισκοπὴ τῆς εὐπρεπείας σου, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἁμάρτῃς. Εἶτα γνώσῃ ὅτι εἰρηνεύσει σου ὁ οἶκος, ἡ δὲ δίαιτα τῆς σκηνῆς σου οὐ μὴ ἁμάρτῃ.
**25** Καὶ γνώσῃ ἔτι πολὺ τὸ σπέρμα σου, τὰ δὲ τέκνα σου ἔσαι ὥσπερ τὸ παμβότανον τοῦ ἀγροῦ·
**26** ἐλεύσῃ δὲ ἐν τάφῳ ὥσπερ σῖτος ὥριμος κατὰ καιρὸν αὐτοῦ θεριζόμενος, ἢ ὥσπερ θημωνία ἅλωνος καθ᾿ ὥραν συγκομισθεῖσα.
**27** Ἰδοὺ ταῦτα οὕτως ἐξηγιάσαμεν, ταῦτά ἐστιν ἃ ἀκηκόαμεν· σὺ δὲ γνῶθι σεαυτῷ τί ἔπραξας.

**ΚΕΦ. Ϛ΄. VI.**

**1** ὙΠΟΛΑΒΩΝ δὲ Ἰὼβ, λέγει·
**2** εἰ γάρ τις ἱστῶν στήσαι μου τὴν ὀργὴν, τὰς δὲ ὀδύνας μου ἆραι ἐν ζυγῷ ὁμοθυμαδὸν,
**3** καὶ δὴ ἄμμου παραλίας βαρύτεραι εἰσιν· ἀλλ᾿, ὡς ἔοικε, τὰ ῥήματα μου ἐστὶ φαῦλα.
**4** Βέλη γὰρ Κυρίου ἐν τῷ σώματί μου ἐστὶν, ὧν ὁ θυμὸς ἐκπίνει μου τὸ αἷμα· ὅταν ἀρξάμαι λαλεῖν κεντοῦσί με.
**5** Τί γάρ; μὴ διακενῆς κεκράζεται ὄνος ἄγριος, ἀλλ᾿ ἢ τὰ σῖτα ζητῶν;
**6** εἰ δὲ καὶ ῥήξει φωνὴν βοῦς, ἐπὶ φάτνης ἔχων τὰ βρώματα; Εἰ βρωθήσεται ἄρτος ἄνευ ἁλός; Εἰ δὲ καὶ ἔστι γεῦμα ἐν ῥήμασι κενοῖς;
**7** Οὐ δύναται δέ μου παύσασθαι ἡ ψυχή· βρόμον γὰρ ὁρῶ τὰ σῖτά μου, ὥσπερ ὀσμὴν λέοντος.
**8** Εἰ γὰρ δῴη, καὶ ἔλθῃ μου ἡ αἴτησις, καὶ τὴν ἐλπίδα μου δῴη ὁ Θεὸς,
**9** ἀρξάμενος ὁ Κύριος τρωσάτω με, εἰς τέλος δὲ μή με ἀνελέτω·
**10** εἴη δέ (μοι) ἡ πόλις μου τάφος, ἐφ᾿ ἧς ἐπὶ τειχέων ἠλλόμην (ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς). Οὐ μὴ φείσομαι· οὐ γὰρ ἐψευσάμην ἐν ῥήματι ἁγίου Θεοῦ μου.
**11** Τίς γάρ μου ἡ ἰσχὺς ἔτι ὑπομενῶ; ἢ τίς μου ὁ χρόνος, ὅτι ἀνέχεται μου ἡ ψυχή;
**12** Μὴ ἰσχὺς λίθων ἢ ἰσχὺς μου; ἢ αἱ σάρκες μου εἰσὶ χαλκαῖ;
**13** Ἢ οὐκ ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ ἐπεποίθην; βοήθεια δὲ ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ ἀπέστιν· ἀπείπατο δέ με ἔλεος, καὶ ἐπισκοπὴ Κυρίου ὑπερίδε με.
**14** Οὐ προσίδον με οἱ ἐγγύτατοί μου· ὥσπερ χειμάρρους ἐκλείπων, ἢ ὥσπερ χύματα, παρῆλθόν με·
**15** οἵτινές με εὐλαβοῦντο, νῦν ἐπιπεπτώκασί μοι.
**16** Ὥσπερ χιὼν, ἢ κρύσταλλος πεπηγὼς, καθὼς τακεὶς θέρμης γινομένης,
**17** οὐκέτι ἐγνώσθη ὅπου ἦν· οὕτως καὶ ἐγὼ κατελείφθην ὑπὸ πάντων,
**18** ἀπωλόμην τε, καὶ ἔξοικος ἐγενόμην.
**19** Ἴδετε ὁδοὺς Θαιμανῶν, καὶ
**20** ἄτραπους Σαβὼν οἱ διορίζοντες αἰσχύνθητε· αἰσχύνην (οἱ δρῶντες) ὀφειλήσουσιν, οἱ ἐπὶ πόλεσι καὶ χρήμασι πεποιθότες.
**21** Ἀτὰρ δὲ καὶ ὑμεῖς ἐπέβητέ μοι ἀνελεημόνως· ὥστε ἰδόντες τὸ ἐμὸν τραῦμα φοβήθητε.
**22** Τί γάρ; μὴ τι ὑμᾶς ἤτησα; ἢ τῆς παρ᾽ ὑμῶν ἰσχύος ἐπιδέομαι;
**23** Ὥστε σῶσαί με ἐκ χειρὸς ἐχθρῶν, ἢ ῥύσασθαί με ἐκ χειρὸς δυνάστου;
**24** Διδάξατέ με, ἐγὼ δὲ κωφεύσω· εἴτι πεπλάνημαι, φράσατέ μοι.
**25** Ἀλλ᾽, ὡς ἔοικε, φαῦλα ἀνδρὸς ἀληθινοῦ ῥήματα.
**26** Οὐ γὰρ παρ᾽ ὑμῶν (ῥῆμα, οὐδὲ) ἰσχὺν αἰτοῦμαι, οὐδὲ ὁ ἔλεγχος ὑμῶν τὰ ῥήματά μου παύσει,
**27** οὐδὲ φθέγματος ῥήματος ὑμῶν ἀνέξομαι.
**28** Πλὴν ὅτι ὀρφανῷ ἐπιπίπτετε, ἐναλλάσσεσθε δὲ ἐπὶ φίλῳ ὑμῶν.
**29** Νυνὶ δὲ ἐμβλέψας εἰς πρόσωπα ὑμῶν, οὐ ψεύσομαι.
**30** Καθίσατε δὴ, καὶ μὴ εἴη ἄδικον (ἐν κρίσει)· καὶ πάλιν τῷ δικαίῳ συνέρχεσθε.
**31** Οὐ γάρ ἐστιν ἄδικον ἐν γλώσσῃ μου· οὐχὶ δὲ (καὶ) ὁ λάρυγξ μου σύνεσιν μελετᾷ;

## CHAPTER V.

**23** For the wild beasts shall be at peace with thee; for with the stones of the field is thy covenant, and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.
**24** And thou shalt know that thy seed is in peace, and a visitation of thy well-being, and thou shalt not fail. Then shalt thou know that thy house shall be in peace, and the dwelling of thy tent shall not go astray.
**25** And thou shalt know that thy seed shall be greatly multiplied, and thy children shall be as the rich herbage of the field.
**26** Thou shalt come to thy grave as corn that is ripe, reaped in its due season, or as a stack upon the threshing-floor gathered in its appointed time.
**27** Behold, these things have we thus ascertained, these are the matters which we have heard; but thou, know thou for thyself what thou hast wrought.

## CHAPTER VI.

**1** Then Job answered and said,
**2** Oh that one would set my grief in a balance, and lift up my pains together in the scales!
**3** For now they are heavier than the sand of the seashore; but, as it seemeth, my words are unseemly.
**4** For the arrows of the Lord are within my body, whose venom doth drink up my blood; whensoever I begin to speak, they pierce me through.
**5** For what reason? Doth the wild ass bray without cause, unless it seeketh fodder?
**6** Or doth the ox bellow, having his food at the manger? Shall bread be eaten without salt? Or is there any savor in empty words?
**7** My soul hath no power to cease [its grieving]; for I behold my food as a roaring terror, [even] as the scent of a lion.
**8** Oh, that my petition might be granted, and that my hope, which God would bestow, might come!
**9** That the Lord would begin to wound me, but not utterly destroy me.
**10** And let my city be my tomb, upon whose walls I once did leap (upon it). I will not hold back; for I have not been false to the word of my holy God.
**11** For what is my strength, that I should yet endure? Or what is my allotted span, that my soul should bear up?
**12** Is my strength the strength of stones? Or are my flesh made of bronze?
**13** Did I not trust in it? But help is far from me; and mercy hath renounced me, and the oversight of the Lord hath disdained me.
**14** My nearest kinsmen have not regarded me; they have passed me by as a failing torrent, or as rushing floods.
**15** They who once held me in reverence, now have fallen upon me.
**16** Like snow, or frozen ice, which, as heat cometh, doth melt away,
**17** So that it is no longer known where it once was; so also have I been forsaken by all,
**18** And I perished, and became an outcast.
**19** Behold the paths of the Temanites, and
**20** The tracks of Sheba, those who traverse them, be ye ashamed. Shame shall they owe (even they who do these things), who trust in cities and in riches.
**21** But ye also have come upon me without mercy, so that seeing my wound, ye were dismayed.
**22** For what? Have I asked aught of you? Or do I stand in need of strength from you?
**23** That ye should save me from the hand of mine enemies, or deliver me from the hand of a mighty oppressor?
**24** Teach me, and I shall hold my peace; and wherein I have erred, declare it unto me.
**25** But it seemeth that the words of a truthful man are contemned.
**26** For I ask not from you (a word, nor) strength; neither shall your reproof put an end to my words,
**27** Neither will I endure the utterance of your word.
**28** But ye fall upon the orphan, and bargain over your friend.
**29** But now, having looked upon your faces, I will not lie.
**30** Sit ye now, and let there be no injustice (in judgment); and again, give heed to that which is righteous.
**31** For there is no injustice upon my tongue; and doth not my throat meditate upon wisdom?
