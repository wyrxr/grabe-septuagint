ΚΕΦ. Ηʹ. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Γʹ. 621
των τῶν λαῶν τῆς γῆς, καθώς ἐλάλησας ἐν χειρὶ Μωυσῆ δούλου
σου, ἐν τῷ ἐξαγαγεῖν σε τοὺς πατέρας ἡμῶν ἐξ Αἰγύπτου. Τότε ἐ-
λάλησε Σαλωμὼν ὑπὲρ τοῦ οἴκου σου, ὡς συνετέλεσε τοῦ οἰκοδο-
μῆσαι αὐτόν, Ἥλιον ἐγνώρισεν ἐν οὐρανῷ· Κύριος εἶπε τοῦ κα-
τοικεῖν ἐν γνόφῳ· οἰκοδόμησον οἶκόν μου, οἶκον εὐπρεπῆ σεαυτῷ
τοῦ κατοικεῖν ἐπὶ καινότητος· οὐχὶ αὕτη γέγραπται ἐν βίβλῳ τῆς
ᾠδῆς; Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς συνετέλεσε Σαλωμὼν προσευχόμενος πρὸς 54
Κύριον ὅλην τὴν προσευχήν, καὶ τὴν δέησιν ταύτην, καὶ ἀνέστη
ἀπὸ προσώπου τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου Κυρίου ὀκλακὼς ἐπὶ τὰ γόνατα
αὐτοῦ, καὶ αἱ χεῖρες αὐτοῦ διαπεπετασμέναι εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν. Καὶ 55
ἔστη, καὶ εὐλόγησε πᾶσαν ἐκκλησίαν Ἰσραὴλ φωνῇ μεγάλη, λέγων·
εὐλογητὸς Κύριος σήμερον, ὃς ἔδωκε κατάπαυσιν τῷ λαῷ αὐτοῦ 56
Ἰσραήλ, κατὰ πάντα ἃ ἐλάλησεν· οὐ διεφώνησε λόγος εἷς ἐν πᾶσι
τοῖς λόγοις αὐτοῦ τοῖς ἀγαθοῖς οἷς ἐλάλησεν ἐν χειρὶ Μωυσῆ
δούλου αὐτοῦ. Γένοιτο Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν μεθ᾽ ἡμῶν, καθὼς 57
ἦν μετὰ τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν· μὴ ἐγκαταλείποιτο ἡμᾶς, μηδὲ ἀπο-
στρέψαιτο ἡμᾶς, ἐπικλῖναι καρδίας ἡμῶν πρὸς αὐτὸν τοῦ πορεύε- 58
σθαι ἐν πάσαις ὁδοῖς αὐτοῦ, καὶ φυλάσσειν πάσας ἐντολὰς αὐτοῦ,
καὶ προστάγματα αὐτοῦ, ἃ ἐνετείλατο τοῖς πατράσιν ἡμῶν. Καὶ 59
ἔστωσαν οἱ λόγοι μου οὗτοι οὓς δεδέημαι ἐνώπιον Κυρίου Θεοῦ
ἡμῶν, ἐγγίζοντες πρὸς Κύριον Θεὸν ἡμῶν ἡμέρας καὶ νυκτός, τοῦ
ποιεῖν τὸ δικαίωμα τοῦ δούλου σου, καὶ τὸ δικαίωμα λαοῦ σου Ἰσ-
ραήλ, ρῆμα ἡμέρας ἐν ἡμέρᾳ αὐτοῦ. Ὅπως γνῶσι πάντες οἱ λαοὶ
τῆς γῆς, ὅτι Κύριος αὐτὸς ὁ Θεός· καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἔτι. Καὶ ἔστωσαν 61
αἱ καρδίαι ἡμῶν τέλειαι πρὸς Κύριον τὸν Θεὸν ἡμῶν,
καὶ ὁσίως πορεύεσθαι ἐν τοῖς προστάγμασιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ φυλάσσειν
ἐντολὰς αὐτοῦ, ὡς ἡ ἡμέρα αὕτη. Καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ πάντες 62
οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ ἔθυσαν θυσίαν ἐνώπιον Κυρίου. Καὶ ἔ- 63
θυσεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Σαλωμὼν τὰς θυσίας τῶν εἰρηνικῶν ἃς ἔθυσε
τῷ Κυρίῳ, βοῶν εἴκοσι καὶ δύο χιλιάδας , καὶ προβάτων ἑκατὸν
εἴκοσι χιλιάδας· καὶ ἐνεκαίνισε τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου ὁ βασιλεύς, καὶ
πάντες οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ. Τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἡγίασεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τὸ 64
μέσον τῆς αὐλῆς τὸ κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ οἴκου Κυρίου· ὅτι ἐποίησεν
ἐκεῖ τὴν ὁλοκαύτωσιν, καὶ τὸ δῶρον, καὶ τὰς θυσίας, καὶ
τὰ στέατα τῶν εἰρηνικῶν, ὅτι τὸ θυσιαστήριον τὸ χαλκοῦν τὸ ἐνώ-

**53** ...of all the peoples of the earth, even as Thou spakest by the hand of Moses Thy servant, when Thou didst bring forth our fathers out of Egypt.

Then spake Solomon concerning Thy House, when he had finished building it: "The sun hath known [its place] in the heaven; the Lord said that He would dwell in darkness: Build Thou My house, a beautiful house for Thyself, to dwell in upon newness." Is not this written in the Book of the Ode?

**54** And it came to pass, when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the Lord, that he arose from before the altar of the Lord, kneeling upon his knees, with his hands spread forth toward heaven.

**55** And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying:

**56** "Blessed be the Lord this day, who hath given rest unto His people Israel, according to all that He spake; there hath not failed one word of all His good words, which He spake by the hand of Moses His servant.

**57** May the Lord our God be with us, as He was with our fathers; may He not forsake us, neither turn Himself from us,

**58** but incline our hearts unto Him, to walk in all His ways, and to keep all His commandments and His statutes, which He commanded our fathers.

**59** And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the Lord our God, be nigh unto the Lord our God day and night, to the end that He may maintain the cause of Thy servant, and the cause of Thy people Israel, [even] the matter of each day in its due day;

**60** that all the peoples of the earth may know that the Lord He is God, and that there is none other.

**61** And let our hearts be perfect toward the Lord our God, to walk piously in His statutes, and to keep His commandments, even as it is this day."

**62** And the king, and all the children of Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the Lord.

**63** And King Solomon offered the sacrifices of peace offerings, which he offered unto the Lord, twenty-two thousand oxen and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep. And the king, and all the children of Israel, dedicated the House of the Lord.

**64** The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the House of the Lord; for there he offered the burnt offering, and the [cereal] offering, and the sacrifices, and the fat portions of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar that was before the Lord was too small to receive the burnt offering, and the [cereal] offering, and the sacrifices of the peace offerings.
