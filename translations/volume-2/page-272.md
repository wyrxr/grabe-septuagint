τοῦ· καὶ ἦλθον, καὶ παρενέβαλον κατέναντι τοῦ Μηδαβά. Καὶ υἱοὶ 7
᾿Αμμὼν συνήχθησαν ἐκ τῶν πόλεων αὐτῶν, καὶ ἦλθον εἰς τὸ πολεμῆσαι.
Καὶ ἤκουσε Δαυίδ, καὶ ἀπέστειλε τὸν ᾿Ιωάβ, καὶ πᾶσαν 8
τὴν στρατιὰν τῶν δυνατῶν. Καὶ ἐξῆλθον υἱοὶ ᾿Αμμὼν, καὶ παρατάσσονται 9
εἰς πόλεμον παρὰ τὸν πυλῶνα τῆς πόλεως· καὶ οἱ βασιλεῖς
οἱ ἐλθόντες παρενέβαλον καθ᾿ ἑαυτοὺς ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ. Καὶ εἶδεν 10
᾿Ιωάβ, ὅτι γεγόνασιν ἀντιπρόσωποι τοῦ πολεμεῖν πρὸς αὐτὸν κατὰ
πρόσωπον καὶ ἐξόπισθεν, καὶ ἐξελέξατο ἐκ παντὸς νεανίου ἐξ ᾿Ισραὴλ,
καὶ παρετάξατο ἐναντίον τοῦ Σύρου. Καὶ τὸ κατάλοιπον 11
τοῦ λαοῦ ἔδωκεν ἐν χειρὶ ᾿Αβεσσὰ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ παρετάξαντο
ἐξεναντίας υἱῶν ᾿Αμμών. Καὶ εἶπεν· ἐὰν κρατήσῃ ὑπὲρ ἐμὲ ὁ 12
Σύρος, καὶ ἔσῃ μοι εἰς σωτηρίαν· καὶ ἐὰν υἱοὶ ᾿Αμμὼν κρατήσωσιν
ὑπὲρ σὲ, καὶ σώσω σε· ἀνδρίζου, καὶ ἐνισχύσωμεν περὶ τοῦ λαοῦ 13
ἡμῶν, καὶ περὶ τῶν πόλεων τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν, καὶ Κύριος τὸ ἀγαθὸν
ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτοῦ ποιήσει. Καὶ παρετάξατο ᾿Ιωάβ, καὶ ὁ 14
λαὸς ὁ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ κατέναντι Σύρων εἰς πόλεμον, καὶ ἔφυγον ἀπ᾿
αὐτοῦ. Καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ ᾿Αμμὼν εἶδον ὅτι ἔφυγον Σύροι, καὶ ἔφυγον 15
καὶ αὐτοὶ ἀπὸ προσώπου ᾿Ιωάβ, καὶ ἀπὸ προσώπου ᾿Αβεσσὰ τοῦ
ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἰσῆλθον εἰς τὴν πόλιν. Καὶ ἦλθεν ᾿Ιωὰβ εἰς
῾Ιερουσαλήμ. Καὶ ἴδε Σύρος ὅτι ἐτροπώσατο αὐτὸν ᾿Ισραὴλ, καὶ 16
ἀπέστειλεν ἀγγέλους· καὶ ἐξήγαγον τὸν Σύρον ἐκ τοῦ πέραν τοῦ
ποταμοῦ, καὶ Σωφὰχ ἀρχιστράτηγος δυνάμεως ᾿Αδρααζὰρ ἔμπροσθεν
αὐτῶν· καὶ ἀπηγγέλη τῷ Δαυίδ, καὶ συνήγαγε τὸν πάντα 17
᾿Ισραὴλ, καὶ διέβη τὸν ᾿Ιορδάνην, καὶ ἦλθεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς, καὶ παρετάξατο
πρὸς αὐτούς· καὶ παρατάσσεται Δαυίδ ἐξεναντίας τοῦ
Σύρου εἰς πόλεμον· καὶ ἐπολέμησαν αὐτόν. Καὶ ἔφυγε Σύρος ἀπὸ 18
προσώπου ᾿Ισραήλ· καὶ ἀπέκτεινε Δαυίδ ἀπὸ τοῦ Σύρου ἑπτὰ χιλιάδας
ἁρμάτων, καὶ τεσσαράκοντα χιλιάδας πεζῶν, καὶ τὸν Σωφὰχ
τὸν ἀρχιστράτηγον δυνάμεως ἀπέκτεινε. Καὶ εἶδον παῖδες 19
᾿Αδρααζὰρ, ὅτι ἐπταίκασιν ἀπὸ προσώπου ᾿Ισραὴλ, καὶ διέθεντο
μετὰ Δαυίδ, καὶ ἐδούλευσαν αὐτῷ· καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησε Σύρος τοῦ
βοηθῆσαι τοῖς υἱοῖς ᾿Αμμὼν ἔτι.

**7** his [people]; and they came and encamped over against Medaba. And the children of Ammon were gathered out of their cities, and came to wage war.
**8** And David heard [thereof], and sent Joab, and all the army of the mighty men.
**9** And the children of Ammon came out, and set themselves in battle array at the gate of the city; and the kings that were come encamped by themselves in the plain.
**10** And when Joab saw that they were arrayed against him, both before and behind, then he chose out of all the young men of Israel, and put them in battle array against the Syrian.
**11** And the rest of the people he gave into the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set themselves in battle array against the children of Ammon.
**12** And he said, "If the Syrian prevail against me, then shalt thou be for my salvation; and if the children of Ammon prevail against thee, then will I save thee.
**13** Be of good courage, and let us strengthen ourselves for our people, and for the cities of our God; and the Lord shall do that which is good in His sight."
**14** So Joab, and the people that were with him, drew nigh before the Syrians unto battle, and they fled from him.
**15** And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, then fled they also from before Joab, and from before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. And Joab came to Jerusalem.
**16** And when the Syrians saw that Israel had put them to flight, they sent messengers; and brought forth the Syrians that were beyond the river, and Shophach, the captain of the host of Hadadezer, went before them.
**17** And it was told David, and he gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set himself in battle array against them. And David set himself in battle array against the Syrian for war; and they fought with him.
**18** And the Syrian fled from before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand men of chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and Shophach, the captain of the host, he slew.
**19** And when the servants of Hadadezer saw that they were smitten before Israel, then they made peace with David, and served him. And the Syrians would no more help the children of Ammon.
