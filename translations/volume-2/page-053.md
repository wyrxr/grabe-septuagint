ΚΕΦ. ΚΓʹ. ΚΔʹ. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Αʹ. 529
οὗ εἴπατε, μήποτε πανουργεύσηται. Καὶ γνῶτε καὶ ἴδετε ἐκ πάν- 23
των τῶν τόπων ὅπου κρύβηται ἐκεῖ, καὶ ἐπιστρέψατε πρὸς μὲ
εἰς ἕτοιμον, καὶ πορεύσομαι μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν· καὶ ἔσται, εἰ ἔστιν ἐπὶ
τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἐξερευνήσω αὐτὸν ἐν πάσαις χιλιάσιν Ἰούδα. Καὶ 24
ἀνέστησαν καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν οἱ Ζιφαῖοι ἔμπροσθεν Σαούλ. Καὶ Δαυὶδ
καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ τῇ Μαὼν καθ᾿ ἑσπέραν ἐκ δε-
ξιῶν τοῦ Ἰεσαιμοῦ. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη Σαοὺλ καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες αὐτοῦ 25
ζητεῖν αὐτόν. Καὶ ἀπηγγέλῃ τῷ Δαυίδ, καὶ κατέβη εἰς τὴν πέ-
τραν τὴν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ Μαὼν. Καὶ ἤκουσε Σαούλ, καὶ κατεδίω-
ξεν ὀπίσω Δαυὶδ εἰς τὴν ἔρημον Μαὼν. Καὶ πορεύονται Σαοὺλ 26
καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες αὐτοῦ ἐκ μέρους τοῦ ὄρους ἐκ τούτου, καὶ ἦν Δαυὶδ
καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες αὐτοῦ ἐκ μέρους τοῦ ὄρους ἐκ τούτου. Καὶ ἐγέ-
νετο Δαυὶδ σκεπαζόμενος πορεύεσθαι ἀπὸ προσώπου Σαούλ. Καὶ
Σαοὺλ καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες αὐτοῦ παρενέβαλον ἐπὶ Δαυὶδ καὶ τοὺς ἄν-
δρας αὐτοῦ, συλλαβεῖν αὐτούς. Καὶ ἄγγελος ἦλθε πρὸς Σαούλ, 27
λέγων· σπεῦδε καὶ δεῦρο, ὅτι ἐπέθεντο ἀλλόφυλοι ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν.
Καὶ ἀνέστρεψε Σαοὺλ μὴ καταδιώκειν ὀπίσω Δαυίδ, καὶ ἐπορεύθη 28
εἰς συνάντησιν τῶν ἀλλοφύλων· διὰ τοῦτο ἐπεκλήθη ὁ τόπος ἐκεῖνος
πέτρα ἡ μερισθεῖσα.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΔʹ. XXIV.

Καὶ ἀνέβη Δαυὶδ ἐκεῖθεν, καὶ ἐκάθισεν ἐν στενοῖς Ἐγγαδδί. 1
Καὶ ἐγενήθη ὡς ἀνέστρεψε Σαοὺλ ἀπὸ ὀπίθεν τῶν ἀλλοφύλων, 2
καὶ ἀπηγγέλῃ αὐτῷ, λέγων· ὅτι Δαυὶδ ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ Ἐγγαδδί.
Καὶ ἔλαβε μεθ᾿ ἑαυτοῦ τρεῖς χιλιάδας ἀνδρῶν ἐκλεκτοὺς ἐκ παν- 3
τὸς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐπορεύθη ζητεῖν τὸν Δαυίδ, καὶ τοὺς ἄνδρας αὐτοῦ
ἐπὶ πρόσωπον Ἀσειμείν. Καὶ ἦλθεν εἰς τὰς ἀγέλας τῶν ποιμενί- 4
ων τὰς ἐπὶ τῆς ὁδοῦ, καὶ ἦν ἐκεῖ σπήλαιον· καὶ εἰσῆλθε Σαοὺλ
παρασκευάσασθαι, καὶ Δαυὶδ καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες αὐτοῦ ἐσώτερον τοῦ
σπηλαίου ἐκάθηντο. Καὶ εἶπαν οἱ ἄνδρες Δαυὶδ πρὸς αὐτόν· ἴ- 5
δοὺ ἡ ἡμέρα αὕτη, ἣν εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς σὲ παραδοῦναι τὸν ἐχ-
θρόν σου εἰς τὰς χεῖράς σου, καὶ ποιήσεις αὐτῷ ὡς ἀγαθὸν ἐν ὀ-
φθαλμοῖς σου. Καὶ ἀνέστη Δαυίδ, καὶ ἀφεῖλε τὸ πτερύγιον τῆς δι-
πλοΐδος τῆς Σαοὺλ λαθραίως. Καὶ ἐγενήθη μετὰ ταῦτα, καὶ ἐπά- 6
ταξε καρδία Δαυὶδ αὐτόν, ὅτι ἀφεῖλε τὸ πτερύγιον τῆς διπλοΐδος

**CHAPTER 23.**

**23** [even] where ye have said, lest he deal craftily. And know ye and see out of all the places where he hideth himself there, and return ye unto me [when ye are] ready; and I will go with you. And it shall be, if he be upon the earth, then will I search him out among all the thousands of Judah.
**24** And the Ziphites arose and went forth before Saul. Now David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, toward evening, on the right hand of Jeshimon.
**25** And Saul and his men went to seek him. And it was told unto David, and he went down to the rock that is in the wilderness of Maon. And Saul heard [thereof], and pursued after David into the wilderness of Maon.
**26** And Saul and his men went forth upon this side of the mountain; and David and his men were upon that side of the mountain. And David made haste to go away from the presence of Saul. And Saul and his men encompassed David and his men, to take them.
**27** And a messenger came unto Saul, saying, "Haste thee and come, for the Philistines have invaded the land."
**28** And Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went to meet the Philistines. Therefore was that place called the Rock of Divisions.

**CHAPTER 24.**

**1** And David went up from thence, and dwelt in the strongholds of Engaddi.
**2** And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from pursuing the Philistines, it was told him, saying, "Behold, David is in the wilderness of Engaddi."
**3** And he took with him three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the face of Aseimein.
**4** And he came to the sheepfolds by the way, where there was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet. Now David and his men abode in the inner part of the cave.
**5** And the men of David said unto him, "Behold, this is the day, concerning which the Lord spake unto thee, [that He would] deliver thine enemy into thy hands; and thou shalt do to him as it shall seem good in thine eyes."
**6** Then David arose, and stealthily cut off the skirt of Saul's robe. And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off the skirt of [Saul's] robe.
