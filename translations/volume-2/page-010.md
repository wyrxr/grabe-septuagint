ἔνι, λέγων· παῤῥαῤῥιφόν με ἐπὶ μίαν τῶν ἱερατειῶν τοῦ φα-
γεῖν ἄρτον.

ΚΕΦ. Γ΄. ΙΙΙ.

1 ΚΑὶ τὸ παιδάριον Σαμουὴλ ἦν λειτουργῶν τῷ Κυρίῳ ἐνώ-
πιον Ἤλεὶ τοῦ ἱερέως. Καὶ ῥῆμα Κυρίου ἦν τίμιον ἐν ταῖς ἡ-
2 μέραις ἐκείναις· οὐκ ἦν ὅρασις διαστέλλουσα. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῇ
ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, καὶ Ἤλεὶ ἐκάθευδεν ἐν τῷ τόπῳ αὑτοῦ· καὶ οἱ
ὀφθαλμοὶ αὑτοῦ ἤρξαντο βαρύνεσθαι, καὶ οὐκ ἠδύνατο βλέπειν.
3 Καὶ ὁ λύχνος τοῦ Θεοῦ πρὶν ἐπισκευασθῆναι, καὶ Σαμουὴλ ἐκά-
4 θευδεν ἐν τῷ ναῷ Κυρίου, οὗ ἡ κιβωτὸς τοῦ Θεοῦ. Καὶ ἐκάλε-
5 σε Κύριος Σαμουήλ, Σαμουήλ. Καὶ εἶπεν· ἰδοὺ ἐγώ. Καὶ ἔδρα-
με πρὸς Ἤλεὶ, καὶ εἶπεν· ἰδοὺ ἐγώ, ὅτι κέκληκάς με. Καὶ
εἶπεν· οὐ κέκληκά σε, ἀνάστρεφε, κάθευδε. Καὶ ἀνέστρεψε, καὶ
6 ἐκάθευδε. Καὶ προσέθετο Κύριος, καὶ ἐκάλεσεν ἔτι Σαμουὴλ,
Σαμουήλ. Καὶ ἀνέστη Σαμουὴλ, καὶ ἐπορεύθη πρὸς Ἤλεὶ τὸ δεύ-
τερον, καὶ εἶπεν· ἰδοὺ ἐγώ, ὅτι κέκληκάς με. Καὶ εἶπεν· οὐ κέ-
7 κληκά σε υἱέ μου, ἀνάστρεφε, κάθευδε. Καὶ Σαμουὴλ πρὶν ἢ γνῶ-
8 ναι τὸν Θεὸν, καὶ πρὶν ἀποκαλυφθῆναι αὐτῷ ῥῆμα Κυρίου. Καὶ
προσέθετο Κύριος καλέσαι ἐπὶ Σαμουὴλ ἐν τρίτῳ· καὶ ἀνέστη,
καὶ ἐπορεύθη πρὸς Ἤλεὶ, καὶ εἶπεν· ἰδοὺ ἐγώ, ὅτι κέκληκάς με.
9 Καὶ ἐσοφίσατο Ἤλεὶ ὅτι Κύριος κέκληκε τὸ παιδάριον. Καὶ εἶ-
πεν Ἤλεὶ τῷ Σαμουήλ· ἀνάστρεφε, κάθευδε τέκνον· καὶ ἔσται ἐὰν
καλέσῃ σε, καὶ ἐρεῖς· λάλε Κύριε, ὅτι ἀκούει ὁ δοῦλός σου. Καὶ
10 ἐπορεύθη Σαμουὴλ, καὶ ἐκοιμήθη ἐν τῷ τόπῳ αὑτοῦ. Καὶ ἦλθε
Κύριος καὶ κατέστη, καὶ ἐκάλεσεν αὐτὸν ὡς ἅπαξ καὶ ἅπαξ·
Σαμουήλ, Σαμουήλ. Καὶ εἶπε Σαμουήλ· λάλει, ὅτι ἀκούει ὁ
11 δοῦλός σου. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Σαμουήλ· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ποιῶ τὰ
ῥήματά μου ἐν Ἰσραὴλ, ὥστε παντὸς ἀκούοντος αὐτὰ, ἠχήσει
12 ἀμφότερα τὰ ὦτα αὑτοῦ. Ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἐπεγερῶ ἐπὶ Ἤ-
λεὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐλάλησα εἰς τὸν οἶχον αὑτοῦ· ἄρξομαι καὶ ἐπιτε-
13 λέσω. Καὶ ἀνήγγειλα αὐτῷ ὅτι ἐκδικήσω ἐγὼ ἐπὶ τὸν οἶχον
αὑτοῦ ἕως αἰῶνος ἐν ἀδικίαις υἱῶν αὑτοῦ, αἷς ἔγνω, ὅτι κακο-
λογοῦντες Θεὸν υἱοὶ αὑτοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἐνουθέτει αὑτοὺς καὶ οὐδ’
14 οὕτως. Ὄμοσα τῷ οἴχῳ Ἤλεὶ, εἰ ἐξιλασθήσεται ἀδικία οἴχου Ἤ-

**Chapter 2**

36 "for an obol of silver and for a loaf of bread, and there is [one] saying: 'Cast me, I pray thee, upon one of the priesthoods, that I may eat bread.'"

**Chapter 3**

1 Now the child Samuel ministered unto the Lord before Eli the priest. And the word of the Lord was precious in those days;
2 there was no distinct vision. And it came to pass on that day, as Eli lay down in his place—for his eyes had begun to wax heavy, so that he could not see—
3 Now the lamp of God, ere it was trimmed [for the night], and Samuel lay down
4 in the temple of the Lord, where the ark of God was. And the Lord called,
5 "Samuel, Samuel." And he said, "Behold, I am [here]." And he ran unto Eli, and said, "Behold, I am [here], for thou hast called me." And he said, "I have not called thee; return, lie down." And he returned, and
6 lay down. And the Lord added [His call], and called again, "Samuel, Samuel." And Samuel arose, and went unto Eli a second time, and said, "Behold, I am [here], for thou hast called me." And he said, "I have not called thee,
7 my son; return, lie down." Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord, neither had the word of the Lord been revealed unto him.
8 And the Lord called Samuel a third time; and he arose, and went unto Eli, and said, "Behold, I am [here], for thou hast called me."
9 And Eli perceived that the Lord had called the child. And Eli said unto Samuel, "Return, lie down, my son; and it shall be, if He call thee, that thou shalt say, 'Speak, Lord, for Thy servant heareth.'"
10 And Samuel went, and lay down in his place. And the Lord came, and stood, and called as at other times: "Samuel, Samuel." Then Samuel answered, "Speak; for Thy servant heareth."
11 And the Lord said unto Samuel, "Behold, I bring to pass My word in Israel, so that at the sound thereof, both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.
12 On that day will I raise up against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house; I will begin, and I will finish.
13 For I have declared unto him that I will visit My vengeance upon his house forever, for the iniquities of his sons, which he knew, that his sons spoke evil of God, yet he did not admonish them, nor even thus.
14 And I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall never be purged with incense nor with sacrifice for ever."
