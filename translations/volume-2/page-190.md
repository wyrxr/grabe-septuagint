**14** τοῦ· καὶ μάλα υἱὸς οὐκ ἔστιν αὐτῇ, καὶ ὁ ἀνὴρ αὐτῆς (οὐκ ἔστιν) πρεσβύτης.
**15** Καὶ εἶπε· κάλεσον αὐτήν. Καὶ ἐκάλεσεν αὐτήν· καὶ ἔστη παρὰ τὴν θύραν.
**16** Καὶ εἶπεν Ἐλισσαιὲ πρὸς αὐτήν· εἰς τὸν καιρὸν τοῦτον, ὡς ἡ ὥρα, ζῶσα σὺ, περιελήφυσαι υἱόν· ἡ δὲ εἶπε·
**17** μή, κύριε, ἄνθρωπε τοῦ Θεοῦ, μὴ διαψεύσῃ τὴν δούλην σου. Καὶ ἐν γαστρὶ ἔλαβεν ἡ γυνὴ, καὶ ἔτεκεν υἱὸν εἰς τὸν καιρὸν τοῦτον, ὡς ἡ ὥρα, ζῶσα, ὡς ἐλάλησε πρὸς αὐτὴν Ἐλισσαιέ.
**18** Καὶ ἠδρύνθη τὸ παιδάριον· καὶ ἐγένετο, ἡνίκα ἐξῆλθε πρὸς τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ, πρὸς τοὺς θερίζοντας, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ· τὴν κε-
**19** φαλήν μου, τὴν κεφαλήν μου. καὶ εἶπε τῷ παιδαρίῳ· ἆρον αὐτὸν πρὸς τὴν μητέρα αὐτοῦ.
**20** Καὶ ἦρεν αὐτὸν πρὸς τὴν μητέρα αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐκοιμήθη ἐπὶ τῶν γονάτων αὐτῆς ἕως μεσημβρίας, καὶ ἀπέθανε.
**21** Καὶ ἤνεγκεν αὐτὸν, καὶ ἐκοίμισεν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὴν κλίνην τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τοῦ Θεοῦ· καὶ ἀπέκλεισε κατ᾽ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐξῆλθε καὶ
**22** ἐκάλεσε τὸν ἄνδρα αὐτῆς, καὶ εἶπεν· ἀπόστειλον δή μοι ἓν τῶν παιδαρίων καὶ μίαν τῶν ὄνων, καὶ δραμοῦμαι ἕως τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τοῦ
**23** Θεοῦ, καὶ ἐπιστρέψω. Καὶ εἶπε· τί ὅτι σὺ πορεύῃ πρὸς αὐτὸν σήμερον; οὐ νεομηνία, οὐδὲ σάββατον. ἡ δὲ εἶπεν· εἰρήνη. Καὶ ἐπέ-
**24** σαξε τὴν ὄνον, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς τὸ παιδάριον ἑαυτῆς· ἄγε, πορεύου, μὴ ἐπίσχῃς μοι τοῦ ἐπιβῆναι, ὅτι ἐὰν εἴπω σοι. Δεῦρο καὶ πο-
**25** ρεύθη, καὶ ἐλθὼν πρὸς τὸν ἄνθρωπον τοῦ Θεοῦ εἰς ὄρος τὸ Καρμήλιον. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς εἶδεν Ἐλισσαιὲ ἐρχομένην αὐτὴν, καὶ εἶπε
**26** πρὸς Γιεζεὶ τὸ παιδάριον αὐτοῦ· Ἰδοὺ ἡ Σουναμῖτις ἐκείνη. Νῦν δράμε εἰς ἀπάντησιν αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐρεῖς· ἡ εἰρήνη σοι; ἡ εἰρήνη τῷ
**27** ἀνδρί σου; ἡ εἰρήνη τῷ παιδαρίῳ; ἡ δὲ εἶπεν· εἰρήνη. Καὶ ἦλθε πρὸς τὸν Ἐλισσαιὲ εἰς τὸ ὄρος, καὶ ἐπελάβετο τῶν ποδῶν αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἤγγισε Γιεζεὶ ἀπώσασθαι αὐτήν. καὶ εἶπεν Ἐλισσαιέ· ἄφες αὐτήν· ὅτι ἡ ψυχὴ αὐτῆς κατώδυνος αὐτὴ, καὶ Κύριος ἀπέκρυψεν ἀπ᾽ ἐμοῦ καὶ οὐκ ἀνήγγειλέ μοι.
**28** Ἡ δὲ εἶπε· μὴ ᾐτησάμην υἱὸν παρὰ τοῦ κυρίου μου; ὅτι οὐκ εἶπα· οὐ πλανήσεις μετ᾽ ἐμοῦ;
**29** Καὶ εἶπεν Ἐλισσαιὲ τῷ Γιεζεί· ζῶσαι τὴν ὀσφύν σου, καὶ λάβε τὴν βακτηρίαν μου ἐν τῇ χειρί σου, καὶ δεῦρο, ὅτι ἐὰν εὕρῃς ἄνδρα οὐκ εὐλογήσεις αὐτὸν, καὶ ἐὰν εὐλογήσῃ σε ἀνὴρ, οὐκ ἀποκριθήσῃ αὐτῷ· καὶ ἐπιθήσεις τὴν βακτηρίαν μου ἐπὶ πρόσωπον τοῦ παιδαρίου.
**30** Καὶ εἶπεν ἡ μήτηρ τοῦ παιδαρίου· Ζῇ Κύριος, καὶ ζῇ ἡ ψυχή σου εἰ ἐγκαταλείψω σε. καὶ ἀνέστη Ἐλισσαιὲ, καὶ ἐπορεύθη ὀπίσω αὐτῆς. Καὶ

**English Translation:**

**THE FOURTH BOOK OF THE KINGS. CHAPTER FOUR.**

**14** "Verily, a son hath she not, and her husband is old."
**15** And he said, "Call her." And he called her, and she stood by the door.
**16** And Elisha said unto her, "At this time, as the season [is due], thou shalt surely bear a son." And she said,
**17** "Nay, my lord, O man of God, do not deceive thy handmaid." And the woman conceived, and bore a son at that set time, as the season [was due], even as Elisha had spoken unto her.
**18** And the child grew. And it came to pass on a day, when he went forth to his father, unto the reapers, that he said unto his father, "My head, my head!"
**19** And he said unto his servant, "Bear him unto his mother."
**20** And he bare him unto his mother, and he lay upon her knees until noon, and died.
**21** And she brought him up, and laid him upon the bed of the man of God, and shut [the door] upon him, and went out, and
**22** called unto her husband, and said, "Send me now one of the servants, and one of the she-asses, that I may run unto the man of God, and return."
**23** And he said, "Wherefore dost thou go to him today? It is neither new moon, nor sabbath." And she said, "Peace." And she saddled
**24** the she-ass, and said unto her servant, "Drive forth, and go; hinder me not in riding, save what I tell thee." So she went, and came
**25** unto the man of God at Mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when Elisha saw her coming, that he said
**26** unto Gehazi, his servant, "Behold, yonder Shunammite woman! Now run, I pray thee, to meet her, and say, 'Is it peace with thee? Is it peace with thy husband? Is it peace with the child?'" And she answered, "Peace."
**27** And she came unto Elisha at the mountain, and laid hold upon his feet. And Gehazi drew near to thrust her away. But Elisha said, "Let her alone; for her soul is in bitter pain, and the Lord hath hidden it from me, and hath not made it known unto me."
**28** And she said, "Did I ask a son of my lord? Did I not say, 'Thou shalt not deceive me [with vain hopes]?'"
**29** Then Elisha said to Gehazi, "Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way. If thou meet any man, thou shalt not salute him; and if any man salute thee, thou shalt not answer him. And lay my staff upon the face of the child."
**30** And the mother of the child said, "As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee." And Elisha arose, and followed after her. And
