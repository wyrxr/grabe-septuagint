22 Ὅτι ναῦς Θαρσεῖς τῷ βασιλεῖ ἐν τῇ θαλάσσῃ μετὰ τῶν
νηῶν Χειράμ· μία διὰ τριῶν ἐτῶν ἤρχετο τῷ βασιλεῖ ναῦς ἐκ
Θαρσεῖς χρυσίου, καὶ ἀργυρίου, καὶ ὀδόντων ἐλεφαντίνων, καὶ πι-
23 θήκων, καὶ ταώνων. Καὶ ἐμεγαλύνθη Σαλωμὼν ὑπὲρ πάντας τοὺς
24 βασιλεῖς τῆς γῆς πλούτῳ καὶ φρονήσει. Καὶ πάντες βασιλεῖς
τῆς γῆς ἐζήτουν τὸ πρόσωπον Σαλωμῶν, τοῦ ἀκοῦσαι τῆς φρο-
25 νήσεως αὐτοῦ, ἧς ἔδωκε Κύριος τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ αὐτοὶ ἔ-
φερον πρὸς αὐτὸν τὰ δῶρα αὐτοῦ, σκεύη ἀργυρᾶ, καὶ σκεύη χρυ-
σᾶ, καὶ ἱματισμόν, στακτήν, καὶ ἡδύσματα, καὶ ἵππους, καὶ ἡ-
26 μιόνους, τὸ κατ᾿ ἐνιαυτὸν ἐνιαυτόν. Καὶ συνέλεξε Σαλωμὼν ἅρ-
ματα καὶ ἵππους, καὶ ἦσαν τῷ Σαλωμὼν τεσσαράκοντα χιλιάδες
θήλειαι ἵπποι καὶ εἰς ἅρματα, καὶ δώδεκα χιλιάδες ἱππέων· καὶ
ἔθετο αὐτὰς ἐν ταῖς πόλεσι τῶν ἁρμάτων, καὶ μετὰ τοῦ βασιλέως
ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ· καὶ ἦν ἡγούμενος πάντων τῶν βασιλέων ἀπὸ τοῦ
27 ποταμοῦ, καὶ ἕως γῆς ἀλλοφύλων, καὶ ἕως ὁρίων Αἰγύπτου. Καὶ
ἔδωκεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τὸ ἀργύριον καὶ τὸ χρυσίον ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ ὡς
λίθους, καὶ τὰς κέδρους ἔδωκεν ὡς συκαμίνους τὰς ἐν τῇ πεδι-
28 νῇ, εἰς πλῆθος. Καὶ ἡ ἔξοδος τῶν ἵππων Σαλωμὼν ἐξ Αἰγύ-
πτου, καὶ ἐκ Θεκουὲ ἔμποροι τοῦ βασιλέως· καὶ ἐλάμβανον ἐκ Θε-
κουὲ ἐν ἀλλάγματι.
29 Καὶ ἀνέβαινεν ἡ ἔξοδος, ἅρματα ἐξ Αἰγύ-
πτου ἀντὶ ἑκατὸν ἀργυρίου· οὕτω πᾶσι τοῖς βασιλεῦσι Χεττιείμ,
καὶ βασιλεῦσι Συρίας κατὰ θάλασσαν ἐξεπορεύοντο.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΑ΄.

1 ΚΑΙ ὁ βασιλεὺς Σαλωμὼν φιλογύναιος ἦν, καὶ ἔλαβε γυναῖ-
κας ἀλλοτρίας πολλάς, καὶ τὴν θυγατέρα Φαραώ, Μωαβίτιδας, καὶ
Ἀμμανίτιδας, καὶ Ἰδουμαίας, Συρίας, Χετταίας, καὶ Ἀμορραίας, ἐκ
2 τῶν ἐθνῶν ὧν ἀπεῖπε Κύριος τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ, Οὐκ εἰσελεύσεσθε εἰς
αὐτούς, καὶ αὐτοὶ οὐκ εἰσελεύσονται εἰς ὑμᾶς, μὴ ἐκκλίνωσι τὰς καρδί-
3 ας ὑμῶν ὀπίσω εἰδώλων αὐτῶν· εἰς αὐτοὺς ἐκολλήθη Σαλωμὼν τοῦ ἀ-
γαπῆσαι. Καὶ ἦσαν αὐτῷ γυναῖκες ἄρχουσαι ἑπτακόσιαι, καὶ παλλακαὶ
4 τριακόσιαι, καὶ ἔκλιναν γυναῖκες αὐτοῦ τὴν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐγενήθη

#### CHAPTER 10

**22** For the king had a fleet of Tarshish upon the sea, with the ships of Hiram. Once every three years came a ship unto the king from Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, and tusks of ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
**23** So King Solomon was magnified above all the kings of the earth, in both riches and wisdom.
**24** And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear the wisdom which the Lord had put into his heart.
**25** And they brought every man his present: vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and apparel, stacte, and spices, horses, and mules; a rate year by year.
**26** And Solomon gathered together chariots and horses; and he had forty thousand mares for chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; and he placed them in the cities appointed for chariots, and with the king in Jerusalem. And he ruled over all the kings, from the River [Euphrates] even unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the borders of Egypt.
**27** And the king made silver and gold to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he as the sycamore trees that are in the plain, in abundance.
**28** And the exportation of Solomon's horses was from Egypt. And the king's merchants brought them from Thekoue; and they received them from Thekoue by way of exchange.
**29** And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for an hundred [shekels] of silver: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria by the sea, were they exported.

#### CHAPTER 11

**1** Now King Solomon was a lover of women, and he took many foreign women, even the daughter of Pharaoh, Moabite women, and Ammonite women, and Edomite women, Syrian women, Hittite women, and Amorite women, from the nations concerning which the Lord had said unto the children of Israel,
**2** "Ye shall not go in unto them, neither shall they come in unto you; lest they turn away your hearts after their idols."
**3** Unto these Solomon did cleave in love. And he had seven hundred wives, who were princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart.
**4** And it came to pass,
