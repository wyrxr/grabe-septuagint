ΠΑΡΑΛΕΙΠΟΜΕΝΩΝ
ΤΩΝ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ ΙΟΥΔΑ Β΄.

ΚΕΦΑΛΑΙΟΝ Α΄. Ι.

¹ ΚΑΙ ἐνίσχυσε Σαλωμὼν υἱὸς Δαυὶδ ἐπὶ τὴν βασιλείαν αὐτοῦ,
   καὶ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς αὐτοῦ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐμεγάλυνεν αὐτὸν εἰς
² ὕψος. Καὶ εἶπε Σαλωμὼν πρὸς πάντα Ἰσραήλ, τοῖς χιλιάρχοις,
   καὶ τοῖς ἑκατοντάρχοις, καὶ τοῖς κριταῖς, καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς ἄρχου-
³ σιν ἐναντίον Ἰσραήλ, τοῖς ἄρχουσι τῶν πατριῶν. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη
   Σαλωμὼν, καὶ πᾶσα ἡ ἐκκλησία μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ εἰς τὴν ὑψηλὴν τὴν
   ἐν Γαβαών, οὗ ἐκεῖ ἦν ἡ σκηνὴ τοῦ μαρτυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ, ἣν ἐποίη-
⁴ σε Μωϋσῆς παῖς Κυρίου ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ. ᾿Αλλὰ κιβωτὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ
   ἀνήνεγκε Δαυὶδ ἐκ πόλεως Καριαθιαρείμ, ὅτι ἡτοίμασεν αὐτῇ
⁵ Δαυὶδ, ὅτι ἔπηξεν αὐτῇ σκηνὴν Δαυὶδ ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ τὸ
   θυσιαστήριον τὸ χαλκοῦν ὃ ἐποίησε Βεσελεὴλ υἱὸς Οὐρίου, υἱοῦ
   Ὤρ, ἐκεῖ ἦν ἔναντι τῆς σκηνῆς Κυρίου. Καὶ ἐξεζήτησεν αὐτὸ Σα-
⁶ λωμὼν, καὶ ἡ ἐκκλησία ὅλη. Καὶ ἀνήνεγκεν ἐκεῖ Σαλωμὼν ἐπὶ τὸ
   θυσιαστήριον τὸ χαλκοῦν ἐνώπιον Κυρίου τὸ ἐν σκηνῇ, καὶ ἀνήνεγ-
⁷ κεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸ ὁλοκαυτώσιν χιλίαν. Ἐν τῇ νυκτὶ ἐκείνῃ ὤφθη ὁ
⁸ Θεὸς τῷ Σαλωμὼν, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· αἴτησαι τί σοι δῶ. Καὶ εἶ-
   πε Σαλωμὼν πρὸς τὸν Θεόν· σὺ ἐποίησας μετὰ Δαυὶδ τοῦ πατρὸς
⁹ μου ἔλεος μέγα, καὶ ἐβασίλευσάς με ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ νῦν, Κύριε ὁ
   Θεός, πιστωθήτω τὸ ὄνομά σου ἐπὶ Δαυὶδ πατέρα μου, ὅτι σὺ ἐβα-
¹⁰ σίλευσάς με ἐπὶ λαὸν πολύν, ὡς ὁ χοῦς τῆς γῆς· νῦν σοφίαν καὶ
   σύνεσιν δός μοι, καὶ ἐξελεύσομαι ἐνώπιον τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου, καὶ
¹¹ εἰσελεύσομαι, ὅτι τίς κρινεῖ τὸν λαόν σου τὸν μέγαν τοῦτον; Καὶ
   εἶπεν ὁ Θεὸς πρὸς Σαλωμὼν ἀνθ᾿ ὧν ἐγένετο τοῦτο ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ
   σου, καὶ οὐκ ᾐτήσω πλοῦτον χρημάτων, οὐδὲ δόξαν, οὐδὲ τὴν ψυ-
   χὴν τῶν ὑπεναντίων, καὶ ἡμέρας πολλὰς οὐκ ᾐτήσω, καὶ ᾐτήσας
   σεαυτῷ σοφίαν καὶ σύνεσιν, ὅπως κρίνῃς τὸν λαόν μου, ἐφ᾿ ὃν ἐβα-
¹² σίλευσα σέ ἐπ᾿ αὐτόν· τὴν σοφίαν καὶ τὴν σύνεσιν δίδωμί σοι, καὶ

**THE SECOND BOOK OF THE CHRONICLES OF THE KINGS OF JUDAH**

**CHAPTER 1**

¹ And Solomon, David's son, was strengthened in his kingdom,
and the Lord his God was with him, and magnified him to a great height.
² Then Solomon spake unto all Israel: to the commanders of thousands,
and to the commanders of hundreds, and to the judges, and to all the
³ princes of Israel, [even] the chief fathers. And Solomon went,
and all the congregation with him, to the high place
that was in Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the testimony of God, which
⁴ Moses the servant of the Lord had made in the wilderness. Yet the ark of God
had David brought up from the city of Kiriath-jearim, for he had prepared for it,
⁵ [yea], David had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem. And the
altar of bronze, which Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of
Hur, had made, was there before the tabernacle of the Lord. And Solomon
⁶ sought it, and all the congregation. And Solomon offered there upon the
altar of bronze before the Lord, [even] that which was in the tabernacle; and he offered
⁷ upon it a thousand burnt offering. In that night the
⁸ God appeared unto Solomon, and said unto him, "Ask what I shall give unto you." And
Solomon said unto God, "You have shown unto David my father
⁹ great mercy, and have made me to reign in his stead; and now, O Lord
God, let your name be confirmed upon David my father, because you
¹⁰ have made me to reign over a great people, as the dust of the earth. Now therefore, give me wisdom and
understanding, that I may go out and come in before this people,
¹¹ for who is able to judge this your great people?" And
God said unto Solomon, "Because this was in your heart,
and you did not ask for riches of money, nor glory, nor the life
of your adversaries, neither did you ask for many days; and, having asked
for yourself wisdom and understanding, that you may judge my people, over whom
¹² I have made you king: the wisdom and the understanding I give unto you; and
