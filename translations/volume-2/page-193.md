ΚΕΦ. Ε΄. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Δ΄.
**12** λεπρῶν· οὐχὶ ἀγαθοὶ Ναεβανὰ καὶ Φαρφάρ, ποταμοὶ Δαμασκοῦ, ὑπὲρ πάντα τὰ ὕδατα Ἰσραήλ; οὐ πορευθεὶς λούσομαι ἐν αὐτοῖς, καὶ καθαρισθήσομαι; καὶ ἐξέκλινε καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ἐν θυμῷ.
**13** Καὶ ἤγγισαν οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐλάλησαν πρὸς αὐτόν· πάτερ, μέγαν λόγον ἐλάλησεν ὁ προφήτης πρός σε, οὐχὶ ποιήσεις; καὶ ὅτι εἶπε πρός σε, λοῦσαι καὶ καθαρίσθητι.
**14** Καὶ κατέβη Ναιμάν, καὶ ἐβαπτίσατο ἐν τῷ Ἰορδάνῃ ἑπτάκις κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα Ἐλισσαίε. Καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν ἡ σάρξ αὐτοῦ ὡς σάρξ παιδαρίου μικροῦ, καὶ ἐκαθαρίσθη.
**15** Καὶ ἐπέστρεψε πρὸς Ἐλισσαῖε αὐτός, καὶ πᾶσα ἡ παρεμβολὴ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἦλθε, καὶ ἔστη εἰς πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπεν· Ἰδοὺ δὴ ἔγνωκα ὅτι οὐκ ἔστι Θεὸς ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ, ὅτι ἀλλ᾿ ἢ ἐν τῷ Ἰσραήλ· καὶ νῦν λάβε τὴν εὐλογίαν παρὰ τοῦ δούλου σου.
**16** Καὶ εἶπεν Ἐλισσαῖε· Ζῇ Κύριος ᾧ παρέστην ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ, εἰ λήψομαι· καὶ παρεβιάσατο αὐτὸν λαβεῖν, καὶ ἠπείθησε.
**17** Καὶ εἶπε Ναιμάν· καὶ εἰ μή, δοθήτω δὴ τῷ δούλῳ σου γόμος ζεύγους ἡμιόνων ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς· ὅτι οὐ ποιήσει ἔτι ὁ δοῦλός σου ὁλοκαύτωμα καὶ θυσίαν θεοῖς ἑτέροις, ἀλλ᾿ ἢ τῷ Κυρίῳ τῷ ῥήματι τούτῳ.
**18** Καὶ ἱλάσεται Κύριος τῷ δούλῳ σου ἐν τῷ εἰσπορεύεσθαι τὸν κύριόν μου εἰς οἶκον Ῥεμμὰν προσκυνῆσαι ἐκεῖ· καὶ αὐτὸς ἐπαναπαύσεται ἐπὶ τῆς χειρός μου, καὶ προσκυνήσω ἐν οἴκῳ Ῥεμμάν· ἐν τῷ προσκυνεῖν αὐτὸν ἐν οἴκῳ Ῥεμμάν, καὶ ἱλασθήσεται δὴ Κύριος τῷ δούλῳ σου ἐν τῷ λόγῳ τούτῳ.
**19** Καὶ εἶπεν Ἐλισσαῖε πρὸς Ναιμάν· δεῦρο εἰς εἰρήνην· καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ εἰς Χειβραθὰ τῆς γῆς (Ἰσραήλ).
**20** Καὶ εἶπε Γιεζὶ τὸ παιδάριον Ἐλισσαῖε· Ἰδοὺ ἐφείσατο ὁ κύριός μου τοῦ Ναιμὰν τοῦ Σύρου τούτου, τοῦ μὴ λαβεῖν ἐκ χειρὸς αὐτοῦ ὧν ἐνήνοχε· Ζῇ Κύριος, ὅτι εἰ μὴ δραμοῦμαι ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ, καὶ λήψομαι παρ᾿ αὐτοῦ τι.
**21** Καὶ ἐδίωξε Γιεζὶ ὀπίσω τοῦ Ναιμάν· καὶ εἶδεν αὐτὸν Ναιμὰν τρέχοντα ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν εἰς ἀπάντησιν αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἅρματος, καὶ εἶπεν· εἰρήνη;
**22** Καὶ εἶπεν· εἰρήνη· ὁ κύριός μου ἀπέστειλέ με, λέγων· Ἰδοὺ νῦν τοῦτο· ἦλθον πρός με δύο παιδάρια ἐξ ὄρους Ἐφραΐμ ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν τῶν προφητῶν· δὸς δὴ αὐτοῖς· τάλαντον ἀργυρίου, καὶ δύο ἀλλασσομένας στολάς.
**23** Καὶ εἶπε Ναιμάν· οὔκουν λάβε διτάλαντον ἀργυρίου· καὶ ἐβιάσατο αὐτόν, καὶ ἔδησε διτάλαντον ἀργυρίου ἐν δυσὶ θυλάκοις, καὶ δύο ἀλλασσομένας στολάς, καὶ ἔδωκεν ἐπὶ δύο παιδάρια αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἦραν ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ.
**24** Καὶ ἦλθεν εἰς τὸ σκοτεινόν, καὶ ἔλαβεν ἐκ τῶν

**English Translation:**

**CHAPTER FIVE.**

**12** [leprosy.] Are not Naebana and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Shall I not go and wash in them, and be made clean? So he turned himself and departed in a rage.

**13** And his servants drew near, and spake unto him, saying, "My father, if the prophet had spoken unto thee a great matter, wouldest thou not have performed it? How much more then, when he saith unto thee, 'Wash, and be made clean'?"

**14** Then Naaman went down, and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the word of Elisha. And his flesh was restored unto him as the flesh of a little child, and he was made clean.

**15** And he returned unto Elisha, he himself, and all his company with him; and he came, and stood before him, and said, "Behold now, I know that there is no God in all the earth, save only in Israel. And now, I pray thee, receive a blessing from thy servant."

**16** And Elisha said, "As the Lord liveth, before Whom I stand, I will not take [it]." And he urged him to take [it], but he refused.

**17** And Naaman said, "If not, then let there be given, I pray thee, unto thy servant a burden of two mules' worth of earth; for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the Lord by this word [of mine]."

**18** "May the Lord, I pray thee, pardon thy servant in this thing: when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth upon my hand, and I bow myself down in the house of Rimmon. For when he boweth down in the house of Rimmon, may the Lord pardon thy servant concerning this matter."

**19** And Elisha said unto Naaman, "Go in peace." And he departed from him unto Cheibratha of the land (Israel).

**20** And Gehazi, the servant of Elisha, said, "Behold, my master hath spared this Naaman, the Syrian, in that he took not from his hand that which he brought. As the Lord liveth, I will surely run after him, and take something from him!"

**21** And Gehazi pursued after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running after him, he turned back to meet him from the chariot, and said, "Is all well?"

**22** And he said, "All is well. My master hath sent me, saying, 'Behold, now this: there are come unto me two young men from Mount Ephraim, of the sons of the prophets. Give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of raiment.'"

**23** And Naaman said, "Nay, I pray thee, take two talents of silver." And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of raiment, and gave them unto two of his servants, and they bare them before him.

**24** And when he came to the secret place, he took [them] from the [hands of his servants].
