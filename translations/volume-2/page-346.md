    ΚΕΦ. ΛΔ΄· XXXIV.
    1 ὩΝ ὀκτὼ ἐτῶν Ἰωσίας ἐν τῷ βασιλεύειν αὐτὸν, καὶ τριακον-
    2 ταὲν ἔτος ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ εὐθὲς ἐναν-
    τίον Κυρίου, καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἐν ὁδοῖς Δαυὶδ τοῦ πατρὸς ἑαυτοῦ, καὶ
    3 οὐκ ἐξέκλινε δεξιὰ καὶ ἀριστερά. Καὶ ἐν τῷ ὀγδόῳ ἔτει τῆς βασι-
    λείας αὐτοῦ, καὶ αὐτὸς ἔτι παιδάριον ἤρξατο τοῦ ζητῆσαι Κύριον
    τὸν Θεὸν Δαυὶδ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐν τῷ δωδεκάτῳ ἔτει τῆς
    βασιλείας αὐτοῦ ἤρξατο τοῦ καθαρίσαι τὸν Ἰούδαν, καὶ τὴν Ἱερου-
    σαλὴμ ἀπὸ τῶν ὑψηλῶν, καὶ τῶν ἀλσέων, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν περιβω-
    4 μίων, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν χωνευτῶν· καὶ κατέστρεψαν κατὰ πρόσωπον
    αὐτοῦ τὰ θυσιαστήρια τῶν Βααλείμ, καὶ τὰ ὑψηλὰ τὰ ἐπ᾿ αὐτῶν·
    καὶ ἔκοψε τὰ ἄλση καὶ τὰ γλυπτά, καὶ τὰ χωνευτά, συνέτριψε, καὶ
    ἐλέπτυνε καὶ ἐῤῥίφεν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον τῶν μνημάτων τῶν θυσιαζόν-
    5 των αὐτοῖς. Καὶ ὀστᾶ ἱερέων κατέκαυσεν ἐπὶ τὰ θυσιαστήρια, καὶ
    6 ἐκαθάρισε τὸν Ἰούδαν καὶ τὴν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἐν πόλεσιν Ἐφραίμ,
    καὶ Μανασσῆ, καὶ Συμεών, καὶ Νεφθαλεί, καὶ τοῖς τόποις αὐτῶν
    7 κύκλῳ. Καὶ κατέσπασε τὰ ἄλση, καὶ τὰ θυσιαστήρια, καὶ τὰ εἴ-
    δωλα κατέκοψε λεπτά, καὶ πάντα τὰ ὑψηλὰ κατέκοψεν ἀπὸ πάσης
    8 τῆς γῆς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἀπέστρεψεν εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ ἐν τῷ ὀκ-
    τωκαιδεκάτῳ ἔτει τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ ὅτε συνετέλεσε τοῦ καθα-
    ρίσαι τὴν γῆν, καὶ τὸν οἶκον τῆς βασιλείας ἀπέστειλε τὸν Σαφὰν
    υἱὸν Ἐσελία, καὶ τὸν Μαασίαν ἄρχοντα τῆς πόλεως, καὶ τὸν Ἰουὰχ
    υἱὸν Ἰωάχαζ τὸν ὑπομνηματογράφον ἑαυτοῦ, κραταιῶσαι τὸν οἶ-
    9 κον Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ἑαυτοῦ. Καὶ ἦλθον πρὸς Χελκίαν τὸν ἱερέα
    τὸν μέγαν, καὶ ἔδωκαν τὸ ἀργύριον τὸ εἰσενεχθὲν εἰς οἶκον Θεοῦ,
    ὃ συνήγαγον οἱ Λευῖται φυλάσσοντες τὴν πύλην ἐκ χειρὸς Μανασ-
    σῆ καὶ Ἐφραίμ, καὶ τῶν ἀρχόντων, καὶ ἀπὸ παντὸς καταλοίπου
    ἐν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ υἱῶν Ἰούδα (καὶ Ἰσραὴλ) καὶ Βενιαμείν, καὶ οἰ-
    10 κούντων ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ ἔδωκαν αὐτὸ ἐπὶ χεῖρα ποιοῦντων
    τὰ ἔργα, οἱ καθισάμενοι ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου, καὶ ἔδωκαν αὐτὸ ποιοῦ-
    σι τὰ ἔργα οἱ ἐποίουν ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου, ἐπισκευάσαι καὶ κατισχύ-
    11 σαι τὸν οἶκον· καὶ ἔδωκαν τοῖς τέκτοσι, καὶ τοῖς οἰκοδόμοις, (καὶ)
    ἀγοράσαι λίθους τετραπόδους, καὶ ξύλα εἰς δοκοὺς στεγάσαι τοὺς
    12 οἴκους οὓς ἐξωλέθρευαν βασιλεῖς Ἰούδα. Καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες ἐν πίστει

    **Chapter 34**

    ¹ Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign,
    ² and one and thirty years reigned he in Jerusalem. And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the ways of David his father,
    ³ and turned not aside to the right hand, nor to the left. For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet a youth, he began to seek the LORD, the God of David his father; and in the twelfth year of his reign he began to cleanse Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and from the Asherah poles, and from the altars, and from the molten images.
    ⁴ And they overthrew before him the altars of the Baalim, and the high places that were upon them; and he cut down the Asherah poles and the graven images, and the molten images he broke in pieces; and he ground [them] to powder and cast [them] upon the faces of the graves of them that sacrificed unto them.
    ⁵ And he burned the bones of the priests upon their altars; and he cleansed Judah and Jerusalem,
    ⁶ yea, and in the cities of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and Simeon, and Naphtali, and their places round about.
    ⁷ And he pulled down the Asherah poles, and the altars, and the idols he cut in pieces, making them small; and all the high places he cut down from all the land of Israel, and returned to Jerusalem.
    ⁸ Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had finished cleansing the land and the royal house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz, his recorder, to strengthen the house of the LORD his God.
    ⁹ And they came unto Hilkiah the high priest, and delivered the silver which had been brought into the house of God, which the Levites who guarded the gate had gathered from the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and from the princes, and from all the remnant in Israel, and of the sons of Judah (and Israel) and Benjamin, and of them that dwelt in Jerusalem.
    ¹⁰ And they delivered it into the hand of them that did the work, who were appointed in the house of the LORD; yea, they gave it unto them that did the work, who wrought in the house of the LORD, to repair and to strengthen the house.
    ¹¹ And they gave [it] to the carpenters, and to the builders, (and) to buy squared stones, and timber for beams to roof the houses
    ¹² which the kings of Judah had destroyed. Now the men were faithful in their work.
