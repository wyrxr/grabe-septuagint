4 σολλὰμ, τὸν γραμματέα τοῦ οἴκου Κυρίου, λέγων· ἀνάθηθι πρὸς
Χελκίαν τὸν ἱερέα τὸν μέγαν, καὶ σφράγισον τὸ ἀργύριον τὸ εἰ-
σενεχθὲν εἰς οἶκον Κυρίου, ὃ συνήγαγον οἱ φυλάσσοντες τὸν σταθ-
5 μὸν παρὰ τοῦ λαοῦ, καὶ δότωσαν αὐτὸ ἐπὶ χεῖρα ποιούντων τὰ
ἔργα, τῶν καθεσταμένων ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου. καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὸ τοῖς
ποιοῦσι τὰ ἔργα, τοῖς ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου, τοῦ κατισχῦσαι τὸ βεδὲχ
6 τοῦ οἴκου, τοῖς τέκτοσι, καὶ τοῖς οἰκοδόμοις, καὶ τοῖς τειχι-
σταῖς, καὶ τοῦ κτήσασθαι ξύλα, καὶ λίθους λατομητούς, τοῦ κρα-
7 ταιῶσαι τὸ βεδὲχ τοῦ οἴκου· πλὴν οὐκ ἐξελογίζοντο αὐτοῖς τὸ
8 ἀργύριον τὸ διδόμενον αὐτοῖς, ὅτι ἐν πίστει αὐτοὶ ποιοῦσι. Καὶ
εἶπε Χελκίας ὁ ἱερεὺς ὁ μέγας πρὸς Σαφφὰν τὸν γραμματέα· βι-
βλίον τοῦ νόμου εὗρον ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου. Καὶ ἔδωκε Χελκίας τὸ
9 βιβλίον πρὸς Σαφφᾶν, καὶ ἀνέγνω αὐτό. Καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς οἶ-
κον Κυρίου πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα, καὶ ἐπέστρεψε τῷ βασιλεῖ ῥῆμα,
καὶ εἶπεν· ἐχώνευσαν οἱ δοῦλοί σου τὸ ἀργύριον τὸ εὑρεθὲν ἐν
τῷ οἴκῳ Κυρίου, καὶ ἔδωκαν αὐτὸ ἐπὶ χεῖρα ποιούντων τὰ ἔργα,
10 τῶν καθεσταμένων ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου. Καὶ εἶπε Σαφφὰν ὁ γραμματεὺς
πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα, λέγων· βιβλίον ἔδωκέ μοι Χελκίας ὁ ἱερεὺς· καὶ
11 ἀνέγνω αὐτὸ Σαφφὰν ἐνώπιον τοῦ βασιλέως. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἤκου-
σεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τοὺς λόγους τοῦ βιβλίου τοῦ νόμου, καὶ ἐξέῤῥηξε τὰ
12 ἱμάτια ἑαυτοῦ. Καὶ ἐνετείλατο ὁ βασιλεὺς τῷ Χελκία τῷ ἱερεῖ,
καὶ τῷ Ἀχικὰμ υἱῷ Σαφφᾶν, καὶ τῷ Ἀχοβὼρ υἱῷ Μιχαίου, καὶ
τῷ Σαφφὰν τῷ γραμματεῖ, καὶ τῷ Ἀσαΐᾳ δούλῳ τοῦ βασιλέως,
13 λέγων· δεῦτε, ἐκζητήσατε τὸν Κύριον περὶ ἐμοῦ, καὶ περὶ παν-
τὸς τοῦ λαοῦ, καὶ περὶ παντὸς τοῦ Ἰούδα, περὶ τῶν λόγων τοῦ
βιβλίου τοῦ εὑρεθέντος τούτου, ὅτι μεγάλη ἡ ὀργὴ Κυρίου ἡ
ἐκκεκαυμένη ἐν ἡμῖν, ὑπὲρ οὗ οὐκ ἤκουσαν οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν τῶν
λόγων τοῦ βιβλίου τούτου, τοῦ ποιεῖν κατὰ πάντα τὰ γεγραμ-
14 μένα καθ᾿ ἡμῶν. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη Χελκίας ὁ ἱερεύς, καὶ Ἀχικὰμ,
καὶ Ἀχοβὼρ, καὶ Σαφφᾶν, καὶ Ἀσαΐας πρὸς Ὄλδαν τὴν προ-
φῆτιν, γυναῖκα Σελλοὺμ, υἱοῦ Θεκκουὲ, υἱοῦ Ἀρὰς, τοῦ ἱματιο-
φύλακος· καὶ αὕτη κατώκει ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐν τῇ μασεναᾷ· καὶ
15 ἐλάλησαν πρὸς αὐτήν. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτοὺς· τάδε λέγει Κύριος
ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ· εἴπατε τῷ ἀνδρὶ τῷ ἀποστείλαντι ὑμᾶς πρὸς
16 με, τάδε λέγει Κύριος· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐπάγω κακὰ ἐπὶ τὸν τόπον
τοῦτον, καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς ἐνοικοῦντας αὐτὸν, πάντας τοὺς λόγους τῆς

### 2 Kings 22

**4** [to] Sollam, the scribe of the house of the Lord, saying, "Go up unto Hilkiah the high priest, and take account of the money that hath been brought into the house of the Lord, which they that keep the post have gathered from the people;
**5** and let them deliver it into the hand of them that do the work, who are appointed over the house of the Lord. And he delivered it unto them that do the work, even to those in the house of the Lord, to strengthen the `bedeq` [repairs] of the house,
**6** unto the carpenters, and unto the builders, and unto the masons; and to acquire timbers and hewn stones, to strengthen the `bedeq` of the house.
**7** Howbeit, no reckoning was made with them of the money given to them, for they wrought faithfully."
**8** And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, "A book of the Law have I found in the house of the Lord." And Hilkiah gave the
**9** book unto Shaphan, and he read it. And he went into the house of the Lord unto the king, and reported a word unto the king, saying,
**10** "Thy servants have melted down the silver that was found in the house of the Lord, and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work, who are appointed over the house of the Lord." And Shaphan the scribe spoke unto the king, saying, "Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book"; and
**11** Shaphan read it before the king. And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the book of the Law, that he rent his garments.
**12** And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Micaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the servant of the king, saying,
**13** "Come ye, inquire of the Lord for me, and for all the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that hath been found; for great is the wrath of the Lord that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according to all things that are written against us."
**14** So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; and she dwelt in Jerusalem in the Masenah; and
**15** they spoke with her. And she said unto them, "Thus saith the Lord God of Israel: Tell the man that sent you unto me,
**16** Thus saith the Lord: 'Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the words of the
