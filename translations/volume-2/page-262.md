25 τὸ παρατάξεως. Τῶν υἱῶν Συμεών, δυνατοὶ ἰσχύος εἰς παράταξιν,
26 ἑπτὰ χιλιάδες καὶ ἑκατόν. Καὶ υἱῶν Λευΐ, τετραχιλίοι καὶ
27 ἑξακόσιοι. Καὶ Ἰωδαὲ ὁ ἡγούμενος τῶν Ἀαρών, καὶ μετ’ αὐτοῦ
28 τρεῖς χιλιάδες καὶ ἑπτακόσιοι. Καὶ Σαδώκ, νέος, δυνατὸς ἰσχύϊ,
29 καὶ τῆς πατρικῆς οἰκίας αὐτοῦ ἄρχοντες εἴκοσι καὶ δύο. Καὶ ἐκ
30 τῶν υἱῶν Βενιαμεὶν τῶν ἀδελφῶν Σαούλ, τρεῖς χιλιάδες· καὶ ἔτι
τὸ πλεῖστον αὐτῶν ἀπεσκόπει τὴν φυλὴν οἴκου Σαούλ. Καὶ ἀπὸ
υἱῶν Ἐφραΐμ, εἴκοσι χιλιάδες καὶ ὀκτακόσιοι, δυνατοὶ ἰσχύϊ, ἄν-
31 δρες ὀνομαστοὶ κατ’ οἴκους πατριῶν αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἡμίσους
φυλῆς Μανασσῆ, δεκαοκτὼ χιλιάδες, οἳ ὠνομάσθησαν ἐν ὀνόματι
32 τοῦ βασιλεῦσαι τὸν Δαυΐδ. Καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσσάχαρ, γινώ-
σκοντες σύνεσιν εἰς τοὺς καιρούς, γινώσκοντες τί ποιῆσαι Ἰσραὴλ
εἰς τὰς ἀρχὰς αὐτῶν, διακόσιοι, καὶ πάντες ἀδελφοὶ αὐτῶν μετ’
33 αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἀπὸ Ζαβουλὼν ἐκπορευόμενοι εἰς παράταξιν πολέμου ἐν
πᾶσι σκεύεσι πολεμικοῖς, πεντήκοντα χιλιάδες βοηθῆσαι τῷ Δαυΐδ
34 οὐ χεροκένως. Καὶ ἀπὸ Νεφθαλείμ ἄρχοντες χίλιοι, καὶ μετ’ αὐ-
35 τῶν ἐν θυρεοῖς καὶ δόρασι, τριακονταεπτὰ χιλιάδες. Καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν
Δανιτῶν παρατασσόμενοι εἰς πόλεμον εἴκοσι καὶ ὀκτὼ χιλιάδες
36 καὶ ὀκτακόσιοι. Καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ Ἀσὴρ ἐκπορευόμενοι βοηθῆσαι εἰς
37 πόλεμον, τεσσαράκοντα χιλιάδες. Καὶ ἐκ πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου ἀπὸ
38 Ῥουβήν, καὶ Γάδδι, καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἡμίσους φυλῆς Μανασσῆ ἐν πᾶ-
σι σκεύεσι πολεμικοῖς, ἑκατὸν εἴκοσι χιλιάδες. Πάντες οὗτοι ἄν-
δρες πολεμισαί, παρατασσόμενοι παράταξιν ἐν ψυχῇ εἰρηνικῇ· καὶ
ἦλθον εἰς Χεβρὼν τοῦ βασιλεῦσαι τὸν Δαυΐδ ἐπὶ πάντα Ἰσραήλ.
39 Καὶ ὁ κατάλοιπος Ἰσραὴλ ψυχὴ μία. Καὶ ἦσαν ἐκεῖ ἡμέρας τρεῖς
ἐσθίοντες καὶ πίνοντες, ὅτι ἡτοίμασαν αὐτοῖς οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτῶν.
40 Καὶ οἱ ὁμοροῦντες αὐτοῖς ἕως Ἰσσάχαρ, καὶ Ζαβουλών, καὶ Νε-
φθαλείμ, ἔφερον αὐτοῖς ἐπὶ τῶν καμήλων, καὶ τῶν ὄνων, καὶ τῶν
ἡμιόνων, καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν μόσχων βρώματα, ἄλευρα, παλάθας, στα-
φίδας, οἶνον, καὶ ἔλαιον, μόσχους καὶ πρόβατα εἰς πλῆθος, ὅτι
εὐφροσύνη ἐν Ἰσραήλ.

**ΚΕΦ. ΙΓʹ. XIII.**
1 ΚΑΙ ἐβουλεύσατο Δαυΐδ μετὰ τῶν χιλιάρχων καὶ τῶν ἑκατοντάρχων,
παντὶ ἡγουμένῳ. Καὶ εἶπε Δαυΐδ τῇ πάσῃ ἐκκλησίᾳ

**Chapter 12**

**25** Concerning the battle array: Of the sons of Simeon, men mighty in valor for battle array, seven thousand and one hundred.
**26** And of the sons of Levi, four thousand and six hundred.
**27** And Jehoiada, the chief of the Aaronites, and with him three thousand and seven hundred.
**28** And Zadok, a young man, mighty in strength; and of his father's house, twenty and two chiefs.
**29** And from among the sons of Benjamin, the brethren of Saul, three thousand; yet the greater part of them did still keep allegiance to the tribe of the house of Saul.
**30** And from the sons of Ephraim, twenty thousand and eight hundred, men mighty in valor, men renowned throughout the houses of their fathers' families.
**31** And from the half-tribe of Manasseh, eighteen thousand, who were named by name to make David king.
**32** And from the sons of Issachar, men who had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do concerning their rulers; two hundred chiefs, and all their brethren were with them.
**33** And from Zebulun, those who went forth into battle array, with all weapons of war, fifty thousand to help David, and that not with empty hands.
**34** And from Naphtali, a thousand chiefs, and with them, bearing shields and spears, thirty and seven thousand.
**35** And from the Danites, those arrayed for war, twenty and eight thousand and eight hundred.
**36** And from Asher, those who went forth to help in war, forty thousand.
**37** And from beyond Jordan, from Reuben, and Gad, and from the half-tribe of Manasseh, with all weapons of war, one hundred and twenty thousand.
**38** All these were men of war, arrayed for battle with a peaceful spirit; and they came to Hebron to make David king over all Israel.
**39** And the rest of Israel were of one accord. And they abode there three days, eating and drinking, for their brethren had made ready [provisions] for them.
**40** And those who bordered them, even unto Issachar, and Zebulun, and Naphtali, brought unto them upon camels, and upon asses, and upon mules, and upon oxen, provisions: meal, and cakes of figs, and dried grapes, and wine, and oil, and calves, and sheep in abundance; for there was joy in Israel.

**Chapter 13**

**1** And David took counsel with the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, [yea], with every leader.
**2** And David said unto all the congregation of Israel:
