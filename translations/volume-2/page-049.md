**ΚΕΦ. ΚΑ΄. ΧΧΙ.**

9 ἡ ῥομφαία Γολιὰθ τοῦ ἀλλοφύλου, ὃν ἐπάταξας ἐν τῇ κοιλάδι Ἡλὰ· καὶ αὕτη εἰλημμένη ἦν ἐν ἱματίῳ ὀπίσω τῆς ἐπωμίδος· εἰ ταύτην λήψῃ, σεαυτῷ λαβέ, ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν ἑτέρα πάρεξ ταύτης ἐνταῦθα. Καὶ εἶπε Δαυΐδ· ἰδοὺ οὐκ ἔστιν ὥσπερ αὕτη· δός μοι αὐτήν.
10 Καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὴν αὐτῷ· καὶ ἀνέστη Δαυΐδ, καὶ ἔφυγεν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἐκ προσώπου Σαούλ. Καὶ ἦλθε Δαυΐδ πρὸς Ἀγχοῦς βασιλέα Γέθ.
11 Καὶ εἶπαν οἱ παῖδες Ἀγχοῦς πρὸς αὐτόν· οὐχὶ οὗτος Δαυΐδ ὁ βασιλεὺς τῆς γῆς; οὐχὶ τούτῳ ἦρχον αἱ χορεύουσαι, λέγουσαι· Ἐπάταξε Σαοὺλ ἐν χιλιάσιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ Δαυΐδ ἐν μυριάσιν αὐτοῦ;
12 Καὶ ἔθηκε Δαυΐδ τὰ ῥήματα ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐφοβήθη σφόδρα ἀπὸ προσώπου Ἀγχοῦς βασιλέως Γέθ.
13 Καὶ ἠλλοίωσε τὸν τρόπον αὐτοῦ, ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ, καὶ προσεποιήσατο ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, καὶ ἐτυμπάνιζεν ἐπὶ ταῖς θύραις τῆς πόλεως, καὶ παρεφέρετο ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔπιπτεν ἐπὶ τὰς θύρας τῆς πύλης, καὶ κατέῤῥει τὰ σίελα αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὸν πώγωνα αὐτοῦ.
14 Καὶ εἶπεν Ἀγχοῦς πρὸς τοὺς παῖδας αὐτοῦ· Ἰδοὺ ἴδετε ἄνδρα ἐπίληπτον, ἱνατί εἰσηγάγετε αὐτὸν πρὸς μέ;
15 Ἢ ἐλαττοῦμαι ἐπιλήπτων ἐγὼ ὅτι εἰσαγήγατε αὐτὸν ἐπιληπτεύεσθαι πρὸς μέ; οὗτος οὐκ εἰσελεύσεται εἰς οἰκίαν μου.

**ΚΕΦ. ΚΒ΄. XXII.**

1 ΚΑὶ ἀπηλλάγη Δαυΐδ ἐκεῖθεν, καὶ ἔρχεται καὶ διεσώθη εἰς τὸ σπήλαιον τὸ Ὀδολάμ, καὶ ἀκούουσιν οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ πᾶς ὁ οἶκος τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ καταβαίνουσιν πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐκεῖ.
2 Καὶ συνήγοντο πρὸς αὐτὸν πᾶς ἐν ἀνάγκῃ, καὶ πᾶς ὑπόχρεως, καὶ πᾶς κατώδυνος τῇ ψυχῇ, καὶ ἦν ἐπ᾿ αὐτῶν ἡγούμενος, καὶ ἦσαν μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ὡς τετρακόσιοι ἄνδρες.
3 Καὶ ἀπῆλθε Δαυΐδ ἐκεῖθεν εἰς Μασσηφὰ τῆς Μωάβ. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς βασιλέα Μωάβ· γινέσθωσαν δὴ ὁ πατήρ μου καὶ ἡ μήτηρ μου παρὰ σοί, ἕως ὅτου γνῶ ὅ,τι ποιήσει μοι ὁ Θεός.
4 Καὶ παρεκάλεσε τὸ πρόσωπον τοῦ βασιλέως Μωάβ, καὶ κατώκουν μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας, ὄντος τοῦ Δαυΐδ ἐν τῇ περιοχῇ.
5 Καὶ εἶπε Γὰδ ὁ προφήτης πρὸς Δαυΐδ· μὴ κάθου ἐν τῇ περιοχῇ· πορεύου, καὶ ἥξεις εἰς γῆν τοῦ Ἰούδα. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη Δαυΐδ, καὶ ἦλθε, καὶ ἐκάθισεν ἐν τῇ πόλει Ἀριάθ.
6 Καὶ ἤκουσε Σαούλ, ὅτι

**CHAPTER 21.**

**9** "Behold, the sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou smotest in the Valley of Elah; and lo, it was wrapped in a garment behind the ephod. If thou wilt take this, take it for thyself, for there is none other here save this." And David said, "Behold, there is none like it! Give it me."
**10** And he gave it him. And David arose, and fled on that day from the face of Saul. And David came unto Achish, the king of Gath.
**11** And the servants of Achish said unto him, "Is not this David, the king of the land? Was it not of him that the dancing women did sing, saying, 'Saul hath smitten his thousands, and David his ten thousands?'"
**12** And David laid up these words in his heart, and he feared greatly before Achish, the king of Gath.
**13** And he altered his demeanor before him, and feigned [madness] on that day, and made marks upon the doors of the city; and he behaved wildly with his hands, and fell upon the doors of the gate, and his spittle ran down upon his beard.
**14** And Achish said unto his servants, "Behold, ye see a man afflicted with a seizure; wherefore have ye brought him to me?
**15** Am I then lacking men afflicted with seizures, that ye have brought this man to suffer a seizure before me? This man shall not come into my house."

**CHAPTER 22.**

**1** And David departed thence, and came and escaped unto the cave of Adullam. And his brethren heard [of it], and all the house of his father, and they went down unto him there.
**2** And there gathered themselves unto him every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was bitter of soul; and he became a captain over them. And there were with him about four hundred men.
**3** And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab. And he said unto the king of Moab, "I pray thee, let my father and my mother dwell with thee, until I know what God shall do for me."
**4** And he besought the favor of the king of Moab, and they dwelt with him all the days that David was in the stronghold.
**5** And Gad the prophet said unto David, "Abide not in the stronghold; depart, and thou shalt come into the land of Judah." And David departed, and came and dwelt in the city of Hareth.
**6** And Saul heard that...
