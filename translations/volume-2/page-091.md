αὐτῆς. Καὶ ἀπέστειλε Δαυὶδ πρὸς Θαμὰρ εἰς τὸν οἶκον, λέγων· 7
πορεύθητι δὴ εἰς τὸν οἶκον Ἀμνὼν τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου, καὶ ποίησον
αὐτῷ τὸ βρῶμα. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη Θαμὰρ εἰς τὸν οἶκον Ἀμνὼν ἀδελφοῦ 8
αὐτῆς· καὶ αὐτὸς κοιμώμενος. Καὶ ἔλαβε τὸ σταῖς καὶ
ἐφύρασε, καὶ ἐκολλύρισε κατ᾿ ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἥψησε τὰς
κολλυρίδας, καὶ ἔλαβε τὸ τήγανον καὶ κατεκένωσεν ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ, 9
καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησε φαγεῖν. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἀμνών· ἐξαγάγετε πάντα ἄνδρα ἀπὸ ἐπάνωθέν μου. Καὶ ἐξήγαγον πάντα ἄνδρα ἀπὸ
ἐπάνωθεν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἀμνὼν πρὸς Θαμάρ· εἰσένεγκε 10
τὸ βρῶμα εἰς τὸ ταμεῖον, καὶ φάγομαι ἐκ τῆς χειρός σου. Καὶ
ἔλαβε Θαμὰρ τὰς κολλυρίδας ἃς ἐποίησε, καὶ εἰσήνεγκε τῷ Ἀμνὼν ἀδελφῷ αὐτῆς εἰς τὸν κοιτῶνα. Καὶ προσήγαγεν αὐτῷ τοῦ 11
φαγεῖν, καὶ ἐπελάθετο αὐτῆς, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ· δεῦρο, κοιμήθητι
μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ, ἀδελφή μου. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· μὴ, ἀδελφέ μου, μὴ 12
ταπεινώσῃς με, διότι οὐ ποιηθήσεται οὕτως ἐν Ἰσραήλ· μὴ ποιήσῃς τὴν ἀφροσύνην ταύτην. Καὶ ἐγὼ ποῦ ἀποίσω τὸ ὄνειδός 13
μου; καὶ σὺ ἔσῃ ὡς εἷς τῶν ἀφρόνων ἐν Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ νῦν λάλησον δὴ πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα, ὅτι οὐ μὴ κωλύσῃ με ἀπὸ σοῦ. Καὶ 14
οὐκ ἠθέλησεν Ἀμνὼν τοῦ ἀκοῦσαι τῆς φωνῆς αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐκραταιώθη ὑπὲρ αὐτήν, καὶ ἐταπείνωσεν αὐτήν, καὶ ἐκοιμήθη μετ᾿ αὐτῆς.
Καὶ ἐμίσησεν αὐτὴν Ἀμνὼν μῖσος μέγα σφόδρα, ὅτι μέγα τὸ 15
μῖσος ὃ ἐμίσησεν αὐτὴν ὑπὲρ τὴν ἀγάπην ἣν ἠγάπησεν αὐτήν.
Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ Ἀμνών· ἀνάστηθι, πορεύου. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Θαμάρ 16
περὶ τῆς κακίας τῆς μεγάλης ταύτης ὑπὲρ ἑτέραν ἣν ἐποίησας μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ, τοῦ ἐξαποστεῖλαί με. Καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησεν Ἀμνὼν
ἀκοῦσαι τῆς φωνῆς αὐτῆς. Καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸ παιδάριον αὐτοῦ, τὸν 17
προεστηκότα τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· ἐξαποστείλατε δὴ
ταύτην ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ ἔξω, καὶ ἀπόκλεισον τὴν θύραν ὀπίσω αὐτῆς. Καὶ ἐπ᾿ 18
αὐτῆς ἦν χιτὼν καρπωτός, ὅτι οὕτως ἐνεδιδύσκοντο αἱ θυγατέρες
τοῦ βασιλέως αἱ παρθένοι τοὺς ἐπενδύτας αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐξήγαγεν
αὐτὴν ὁ λειτουργὸς αὐτοῦ ἔξω, καὶ ἀπέκλεισε τὴν θύραν ὀπίσω
αὐτῆς. Καὶ ἔλαβε Θαμὰρ σποδόν, καὶ ἐπέθηκεν ἐπὶ τῆς κεφαλῆς 19
αὐτῆς, καὶ τὸν χιτῶνα τὸν καρπωτὸν τὸν ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς διέρρηξε, καὶ ἐπέθηκε τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῆς ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτῆς, καὶ
ἐπορεύθη πορευομένη καὶ κράζουσα. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτὴν Ἀβεσσαλὼμ ὁ 20
ἀδελφὸς αὐτῆς· μὴ Ἀμνὼν ὁ ἀδελφός σου ἐγένετο με-

### Chapter 13

**7** her hand. And David sent unto Tamar to the house, saying,
Go now unto the house of Amnon thy brother,
and make him food.
**8** And Tamar went unto the house of Amnon her brother;
and he was laid down.
And she took flour, and kneaded it,
and made cakes before his eyes, and did bake the cakes.
**9** And she took the pan and poured [them] out before him;
but he would not eat.
And Amnon said, Send forth every man from my presence.
And they sent forth every man from him.
**10** And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the food into the inner chamber,
that I may eat of thy hand.
And Tamar took the cakes which she had made,
and brought them unto Amnon her brother into the bedchamber.
**11** And she brought [it] near unto him to eat;
and he forgat her, and said unto her,
Come, lie with me, my sister.
**12** And she said unto him, Nay, my brother, do not humble me:
for such a thing ought not to be done in Israel;
do not thou this folly.
**13** And I, whither shall I bear my reproach?
And thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel.
Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king;
for he will not withhold me from thee.
**14** But Amnon would not hearken unto her voice:
and he was stronger than she, and he humbled her, and lay with her.
**15** Then Amnon hated her with a great hatred;
for the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater
than the love wherewith he had loved her.
And Amnon said unto her, Arise, begone.
**16** And Tamar said unto him, This great evil, in sending me forth,
is greater than the other which thou didst unto me.
But Amnon would not hearken unto her voice.
**17** And he called his servant that was set over his house, and said unto him,
Send forth now this [woman] from me,
and shut thou the door after her.
**18** Now she had a long-sleeved tunic upon her;
for with such robes were the virgin daughters of the king attired.
And his minister brought her out,
and shut the door after her.
**19** And Tamar took ashes, and put them on her head,
and rent her long-sleeved tunic that was upon her;
and she laid her hands on her head,
and went on her way weeping and crying out.
**20** And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee?
