¹⁹ And the children of the captivity kept the Passover upon the fourteenth [day] of the first month.
²⁰ For the priests and the Levites were purified, until, unto all, they were clean. And they slew the Passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves.
²¹ And the children of Israel, who were come from the captivity, and all such as had separated themselves from the uncleanness of the nations of the land unto them, did eat of the Passover, [seeking] the Lord their God of Israel.
²² And they kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with joy: for the Lord had made them joyful, and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of the God of Israel.

⁸ And they came unto Jerusalem in the fifth month; this was the seventh year of the king.
⁹ For on the first day of the first month he set forth upon the ascent from Babylon; and on the first day of the fifth month they came unto Jerusalem, because the Hand of his God was good upon him.
¹⁰ For Ezra had given his heart to seek the Law [of the Lord], and to do and to teach in Israel [His] prescripts and decrees.
¹¹ Now this is the declaration of the decree, which Artaxerxes gave unto Ezra the priest, the scribe of the book of the words of the commandments of the Lord, and of His statutes concerning Israel.
