καὶ τὴν Ἰεσυνὰ καὶ τὰς κώμας αὐτῆς, καὶ τὴν Ἐφρὼν καὶ τὰς κώ-
μας αὐτῆς. Καὶ οὐκ ἔσχεν ἰσχὺν Ἱεροβοὰμ ἔτι πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας 20
Ἀβιὰ, καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτὸν Κύριος· καὶ ἐτελεύτησε. Καὶ κατίσχυ- 21
σεν Ἀβιὰ, καὶ ἔλαβεν ἑαυτῷ γυναῖκας δεκατέσσαρας, καὶ ἐγέννησεν
υἱοὺς εἰκοσιδύο καὶ θυγατέρας δεκαέξ. Καὶ οἱ λοιποὶ λόγοι Ἀβιὰ, 22
καὶ αἱ πράξεις αὐτοῦ, καὶ οἱ λόγοι αὐτοῦ, γεγραμμένοι ἐπὶ βιβλίῳ
τοῦ προφήτου Ἀδδώ.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΔʹ. XIV.

ΚΑΙ ἀπέθανεν Ἀβιὰ μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔθαψαν 1
αὐτὸν ἐν πόλει Δαυΐδ, καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Ἀσὰ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀντ’ αὐτοῦ.
ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις Ἀσὰ ἡσύχασεν ἡ γῆ Ἰούδα ἔτη δέκα· καὶ ἐποίησε 2
τὸ καλὸν καὶ τὸ εὐθὲς ἐνώπιον Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ἑαυτοῦ· καὶ ἀπέστη- 3
σε τὰ θυσιαστήρια τῶν ἀλλοτρίων, καὶ τὰ ὑψηλὰ, καὶ συνέτριψε
τὰς στήλας, καὶ ἐξέκοψε τὰ ἄλση, καὶ εἶπε τῷ Ἰούδα ἐκζητῆσαι τὸν 4
Κύριον Θεὸν τῶν πατέρων ἑαυτῶν, καὶ ποιῆσαι τὸν νόμον, καὶ
τὰς ἐντολάς. Καὶ ἀπέστησεν ἀπὸ πασῶν τῶν πόλεων Ἰούδα τὰ 5
θυσιαστήρια, καὶ τὰ εἴδωλα, καὶ εἰρήνευσε πόλεις τειχήρεις ἐν γῇ 6
Ἰούδα, ὅτι εἰρήνευσεν ἡ γῆ, καὶ οὐκ ἦν αὐτῷ πόλεμος ἐν τοῖς ἔ-
τεσι τούτοις, ὅτι κατέπαυσεν αὐτῷ Κύριος. Καὶ εἶπε τῷ Ἰούδα· 7
οἰκοδομήσωμεν τὰς πόλεις ταύτας, καὶ ποιήσωμεν τείχη, καὶ πύρ-
γους, καὶ πύλας, καὶ μοχλοὺς, ἐν ᾧ τῆς γῆς κυριεύομεν. ὅτι κα-
θὼς ἐξεζητήσαμεν Κύριον Θεὸν ἡμῶν, ἐξεζήτησεν ἡμᾶς, καὶ κατ-
έπαυσεν ἡμᾶς κυκλόθεν, καὶ εὐώδωσεν ἡμῖν. Καὶ ἐγένετο τῷ Ἀσὰ 8
δύναμις ὁπλοφόρων αἰρόντων θυρεοὺς καὶ δόρατα ἐν γῇ Ἰούδα,
τριακόσιαι χιλιάδες, καὶ ἐν γῇ Βενιαμεὶν πελτασταὶ καὶ τοξόται,
διακόσιαι καὶ ὀγδοήκοντα χιλιάδες, πάντες οὗτοι πολεμισταὶ δυ-
νάμεως. Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς Ζαρὲ ὁ Αἰθίοψ ἐν δυνάμει, ἐν 9
χιλίαις χιλιάσι, καὶ ἅρμασι τριακοσίοις, καὶ ἦλθεν ἕως Μαρησά.
Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Ἀσὰ εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτῷ, καὶ παρετάξατο πόλεμον 10
ἐν τῇ φάραγγι κατὰ βορρᾶν Μαρησά. Καὶ ἐβόησεν Ἀσὰ πρὸς Κύ- 11
ριον Θεὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπε· Κύριε, οὐκ ἀδυνατεῖ παρὰ σοὶ σώζειν
ἐν πολλοῖς καὶ ἐν ὀλίγοις, κατίσχυσον ἡμᾶς, Κύριε ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν,
ὅτι ἐπὶ σοὶ πεποίθαμεν, καὶ ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί σου ἤλθομεν ἐπὶ
πλῆθος τὸ πολὺ τοῦτο· Κύριε ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν, μὴ κατισχυσάτω πρὸς

**Chapter 13**

...and Jeshana with its villages, and Ephron with its villages.
²⁰And Jeroboam had no more strength throughout all the days of Abijah; and the Lord smote him, and he died.
²¹And Abijah grew mighty, and took to himself fourteen wives, and begat twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.
²²Now the rest of the matters of Abijah, and his deeds, and his words, behold, they are written in the book of the prophet Iddo.

**Chapter 14**

¹And Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and Asa his son reigned in his stead.
²In the days of Asa, the land of Judah rested for ten years.
And he did that which was good and upright in the sight of the Lord his God.
³And he removed the altars of the foreign gods, and the high places; and he broke down the sacred pillars, and cut down the Asherim.
⁴And he commanded Judah to seek the Lord God of their fathers, and to do the Law, and the commandments.
⁵Moreover, he took away out of all the cities of Judah the altars and the idols.
⁶And he fortified walled cities in the land of Judah; for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years, because the Lord had given him rest.
⁷And he said unto Judah, "Let us build these cities, and make walls, and towers, and gates, and bars; whilst we yet possess the land.
Forasmuch as we have sought the Lord our God, He hath sought us, and hath given us rest on every side, and hath prospered us."
⁸And Asa had an army of armed men, bearing shields and spears, in the land of Judah, three hundred thousand; and in the land of Benjamin, men bearing light shields and archers, two hundred and eighty thousand: all these were mighty men of valour.
⁹And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an army, with a thousand thousands, and three hundred chariots; and he came unto Mareshah.
¹⁰And Asa went out to meet him, and he set the battle in array in the valley towards the north of Mareshah.
¹¹And Asa cried unto the Lord his God, and said, "O Lord, it is not difficult for You to save, whether with many or with few. Strengthen us, O Lord our God; for in You we have put our trust, and in Your Name have we come against this great multitude. O Lord our God, let not [any] man prevail against [You]."
