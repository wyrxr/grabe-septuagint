⁷ λη ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης· καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἀνομίαις ἡμῶν παρεδόθημεν
   ἡμεῖς καὶ οἱ βασιλεῖς ἡμῶν καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ ἡμῶν ἐν χειρὶ βασιλέων
   ἐθνῶν ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ, καὶ ἐν αἰχμαλωσίᾳ, καὶ ἐν διαρπαγῇ, καὶ
⁸ ἐν αἰσχύνη προσώπου ἡμῶν, ὡς ἡ ἡμέρα αὕτη. Καὶ νῦν ἐπιεικεύσατο
   ἡμῖν Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν τοῦ καταλιπεῖν ἡμῖν εἰς σωτηρίαν,
   καὶ δοῦναι ἡμῖν στήριγμα ἐν τόπῳ ἁγιάσματος αὑτοῦ, τοῦ
   φωτίσαι ὀφθαλμοὺς ἡμῶν καὶ δοῦναι ζωοποίησιν μικρὰν ἐν τῇ δου-
⁹ λείᾳ ἡμῶν· ὅτι δοῦλοι ἐσμέν, καὶ ἐν τῇ δουλείᾳ ἡμῶν οὐκ ἐγκατέλιπεν
   ἡμᾶς Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν· καὶ ἔκλινεν ἐφ᾿ ἡμᾶς ἔλεος ἐνώπιον
   βασιλέων Περσῶν, δοῦναι ἡμῖν ζωοποίησιν τοῦ ὑψῶσαι αὑτοὺς
   τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν, καὶ ἀναστῆσαι τὰ ἔρημα αὐτῆς,
¹⁰ καὶ τοῦ δοῦναι ἡμῖν φραγμὸν ἐν Ἰούδᾳ καὶ ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ. Τί εἴπομεν
   ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν μετὰ τοῦτο; ὅτι ἐγκατελίπομεν ἐντολάς σου,
¹¹ ἃς ἔδωκας ἡμῖν ἐν χειρὶ δούλων σου τῶν προφητῶν, λέγων· ἡ γῆ,
   εἰς ἣν εἰσπορεύεσθε κληρονομῆσαι αὐτήν, γῆ μετακινουμένη ἐστὶν
   ἐν μετακινήσει λαῶν τῶν ἐθνῶν ἐν μακρύμασιν αὐτῶν, ὧν ἔπλησαν
¹² αὐτὴν ἀπὸ σώματος ἐπὶ σῶμα ἐν ἀκαθαρσίαις αὐτῶν· καὶ νῦν
   τὰς θυγατέρας ὑμῶν μὴ δότε τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτῶν, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν θυ-
   γατέρων αὐτῶν μὴ λάβητε τοῖς υἱοῖς ὑμῶν, καὶ οὐκ ἐκζητήσετε
   εἰρήνην αὐτῶν καὶ ἀγαθὸν αὐτῶν ἕως αἰῶνος, ὅπως ἐνισχύσητε καὶ
   φάγητε τὰ ἀγαθὰ τῆς γῆς, καὶ κληρονομήσητε τοῖς υἱοῖς ὑμῶν
¹³ ἕως αἰῶνος. Καὶ μετὰ πᾶν τὸ ἐρχόμενον ἐφ᾿ ἡμᾶς ἐν ποιήμασιν
   ἡμῶν τοῖς πονηροῖς καὶ ἐν πλημμελείᾳ ἡμῶν τῇ μεγάλῃ, ὅτι οὐκ
   ἔστιν ὡς ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν, ὅτι ἐκούφισας ἡμῶν τὰς ἀνομίας, καὶ ἔδωκας
   ἡμῖν σωτηρίαν·
¹⁴ ὅτι ἀπεστρέψαμεν διασκεδάσαι ἐντολάς σου,
   καὶ ἐπιγαμβρεῦσαι τοῖς λαοῖς τῶν γαιῶν· μὴ παροξυνθῇς ἐν ἡμῖν
   ἕως συντελείας, τοῦ μὴ εἶναι ἐγκατάλειμμα καὶ διασωζόμενον.
¹⁵ Κύριε ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραὴλ δίκαιος σύ, ὅτι κατελείφθημεν διασωζόμενοι,
   ὡς ἡ ἡμέρα αὕτη· ἰδοὺ ἡμεῖς ἐναντίον σου ἐν πλημμελείαις
   ἡμῶν, ὅτι οὐκ ἐστι στῆναι ἐνώπιόν σου ἐπὶ τούτῳ.

**ΚΕΦ. Ιʹ.**

¹ ΚΑΙ ὡς προσηύξατο Ἔζρας, καὶ ὡς ἐξηγόρευσε κλαίων καὶ
   προσευχόμενος ἐνώπιον οἴκου τοῦ Θεοῦ, συνήχθησαν πρὸς αὐτὸν
   ἀπὸ Ἰσραὴλ ἐκκλησία πολλὴ σφόδρα, ἄνδρες καὶ γυναῖκες καὶ νεανίσκοι,

#### EZRA
#### Chapter 9

⁷ ...unto this day; and in our iniquities were we delivered,
   both we, and our kings, and our sons, into the hand of the kings of the nations,
   by the sword, and into captivity, and into plunder, and
⁸ unto the confusion of our countenances, as it is this day.
   And now, the Lord our God hath been gracious unto us,
   to leave us a remnant for deliverance, and to give us a firm place
   in His holy sanctuary, to enlighten our eyes and to grant us
   a small quickening in our bondage;
⁹ For bondservants are we, and in our bondage the Lord our God
   hath not forsaken us; but He hath extended mercy unto us
   in the sight of the kings of Persia, to grant us a quickening
   to raise up for ourselves the House of our God,
   and to restore its desolate places,
¹⁰ and to give us a wall of defense in Judah and in Jerusalem.
   What then shall we say, O our God, after this?
   For we have forsaken Thy commandments,
¹¹ which Thou gavest unto us by the hand of Thy servants the prophets, saying:
   "The land, into which ye enter to inherit it,
   is a land of separation, through the alienations of the peoples of the nations,
   in their profanations, wherewith they have filled it utterly
¹² with their uncleanness. And now, ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons,
   neither shall ye take their daughters unto your sons;
   and ye shall not seek their peace nor their good forever,
   that ye may be strengthened, and eat the good things of the land,
   and inherit it for your sons forever."
¹³ And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds and for our great trespass,
   [yet it is] because there is none like our God, because Thou hast lightened our iniquities,
   and hast given us salvation;
¹⁴ If we again turn away to disregard Thy commandments,
   and to intermarry with the peoples of the lands,
   then be not Thou provoked against us even unto utter destruction,
   that there be left no remnant nor any preserved.
¹⁵ O Lord God of Israel, righteous art Thou;
   for we are left a saved remnant, as it is this day.
   Behold, we are before Thee in our trespasses,
   for none can stand before Thee because of this.

¹ Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and supplicating
   before the House of God, there gathered unto him out of Israel
   a very great congregation, both men and women and young men,
