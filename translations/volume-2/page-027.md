ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Α´. 503
ΚΕΦ. ΙΓ´. ΧΙΙΙ.
Υἱὸς ἐνιαυτοῦ ἦν Σαούλ, ἐν τῷ βασιλεύειν αὐτὸν, καὶ δύο ἔτη 1
ἐβασίλευσεν ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ· καὶ ἐκλέγεται ἑαυτῷ Σαούλ τρεῖς 2
χιλιάδας ἀνδρῶν· ἐκ τῶν ἀνδρῶν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἦσαν μετὰ Σαούλ
δισχίλιοι οἱ ἐν Μαχμὰς, καὶ ἐν τῷ ὄρει Βαιθήλ, καὶ χίλιοι ἦ-
σαν μετὰ Ἰωνάθαν ἐν Γαβαὰ τοῦ Βενιαμείν· καὶ τὸ κατάλοιπον
τοῦ λαοῦ ἐξαπέστειλεν ἕκαστον εἰς τὸ σκήνωμα αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐπά- 3
ταξεν Ἰωνάθαν τὸν Νασεὶβ τὸν ἀλλόφυλον τὸν ἐν τῷ βουνῷ, καὶ
ἀκούουσιν οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι· καὶ Σαοὺλ σάλπιγγι σαλπίζει εἰς πᾶσαν
τὴν γῆν, λέγων· ἠθετήκασιν οἱ δοῦλοι. Καὶ πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ ἤκουσαν 4
λεγόντων, πέπαικε Σαοὺλ τὸν Νασεὶβ τὸν ἀλλόφυλον, καὶ ἠσχύνθησαν
Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τοῖς ἀλλοφύλοις· καὶ ἀνεβόησεν ὁ λαὸς ὀπίσω Σαοὺλ ἐν
Γαλγάλοις. Καὶ οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι συνάγονται εἰς πόλεμον ἐπὶ Ἰσραὴλ, 5
καὶ ἀναβαίνουσιν ἐπὶ Ἰσραὴλ τριάκοντα χιλιάδες ἁρμάτων,
καὶ ἓξ χιλιάδες ἱππέων, καὶ λαὸς ὡς ἡ ἄμμος ἡ παρὰ τὸ χεῖ-
λος τῆς θαλάσσης τῷ πλήθει· καὶ ἀναβαίνουσι καὶ παρεμβάλλου-
σιν ἐν Μαχμὰς ἐξ ἐναντίας Βαιθωρῶν κατὰ νότου. Καὶ ἀνὴρ 6
Ἰσραὴλ εἶδεν ὅτι στενῶς αὐτῷ μὴ προσάγειν αὐτὸν, καὶ ἐκρύβη
ὁ λαὸς ἐν τοῖς σπηλαίοις, καὶ ἐν ταῖς μάνδραις, καὶ ἐν ταῖς πέ-
τραις, καὶ ἐν τοῖς βόθροις, καὶ ἐν τοῖς λάκκοις. Καὶ οἱ ἐκβαί- 7
νοντες διέβησαν τὸν Ἰορδάνην εἰς γῆν Γὰδ καὶ Γαλαάδ· καὶ Σα-
οὺλ ἔτι ἦν ἐν Γαλγάλοις, καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ἐξέστη ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ.
Καὶ διέλιπεν ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας τῷ μαρτυρίῳ ὡς εἶπε Σαμουὴλ, καὶ οὐ 8
παρεγένετο Σαμουὴλ εἰς Γάλγαλα· καὶ διεσπάρη ὁ λαὸς αὐτοῦ
ἀπ᾽ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπε Σαούλ· προσαγάγετε ὅπως ποιήσω ὁλοκαύ- 9
τωσιν καὶ εἰρηνικάς· καὶ ἀνήνεγκε τὴν ὁλοκαύτωσιν. Καὶ ἐγένε- 10
το ὡς συνετέλεσεν ἀναφέρων τὴν ὁλοκαύτωσιν, καὶ Σαμουὴλ πα-
ραγίνεται· καὶ ἐξῆλθε Σαοὺλ εἰς ἀπάντησιν αὐτῷ, εὐλογῆσαι αὐ-
τόν. Καὶ εἶπε Σαμουήλ· τί πεποίηκας; Καὶ εἶπε Σαούλ· ὅτι εἶδον 11
ὡς διεσπάρη ὁ λαὸς ἀπ᾽ ἐμοῦ, καὶ σὺ οὐ παρεγένου ὡς διετάξω
ἐν τῷ μαρτυρίῳ τῶν ἡμερῶν, καὶ οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι συνήχθησαν εἰς
Μαχμὰς, καὶ εἶπα· νῦν καταβήσονται οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι πρὸς μὲ εἰς 12
Γάλγαλα, καὶ τοῦ προσώπου τοῦ Κυρίου οὐκ ἐδεήθην, καὶ ἐνεκρατευσάμην
καὶ ἀνήνεγκα τὴν ὁλοκαύτωσιν. Καὶ εἶπε Σαμουὴλ 13
πρὸς Σαούλ· μεμώρανταί σοι, ὅτι οὐκ ἐφύλαξας τὴν ἐντολήν μου
ἣν ἐνετείλατό σοι Κύριος· ὡς νῦν ἡτοίμασε Κύριος τὴν βασιλεί- 14
αν σου ἐπὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἕως αἰῶνος· καὶ νῦν ἡ βασιλεία σου οὐ στή-
σεται σοι, καὶ ζητήσει Κύριος ἑαυτῷ ἄνθρωπον κατὰ τὴν καρ-
δίαν αὑτοῦ, καὶ ἐντελεῖται Κύριος αὑτῷ εἰς ἄρχοντα ἐπὶ τὸν λα- 15
ὸν αὑτοῦ, ὅτι οὐκ ἐφύλαξας ὅσα ἐνετείλατό σοι Κύριος. Καὶ
ἀνέστη Σαμουήλ, καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ἐκ Γαλγάλων· καὶ τὸ κατάλειμ-
μα τοῦ λαοῦ ἀνέβη ὀπίσω Σαοὺλ εἰς ἀπάντησιν ὀπίσω τοῦ λαοῦ
τοῦ πολεμιστοῦ, αὑτῶν παραγενομένων ἐκ Γαλγάλων εἰς Γα-
βαὰ Βενιαμείν· καὶ ἐπεσκέψατο Σαοὺλ τὸν λαὸν τὸν εὑρεθέν-
τα μετ᾿ αὑτοῦ ὡς ἑξακοσίους ἄνδρας. Καὶ Σαοὺλ καὶ Ἰωνά- 16
θαν υἱὸς αὑτοῦ καὶ ὁ λαὸς οἱ εὑρεθέντες μετ᾿ αὑτῶν ἐκάθισαν
ἐν Γαβαὰ Βενιαμείν καὶ ἔκλαιον, καὶ οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι παρεμβεβλή-
κεισαν ἐν Μαχμάς. Καὶ ἐξῆλθε διαφθείρων ἐξ ἀγροῦ ἀλλοφύλων 17
τρισὶν ἀρχαῖς· ἡ ἀρχὴ ἡ μία ἐπιβλέπουσα ὁδὸν Γοφερὰ ἐπὶ γῆν
Σωγάλ, καὶ ἡ ἀρχὴ ἡ μία ἐπιβλέπουσα ὁδὸν Βαιθωρών, 18
καὶ ἡ ἀρχὴ ἡ μία ἐπιβλέπουσα ὁδὸν Γαβαέ, τὴν εἰσχύπτουσαν
ἐπὶ Γαὶ τὴν Σαβεὶμ τὴν ἔρημον. Καὶ τέκτων σιδήρου οὐχ εὑ- 19
ρίσκετο ἐν πάσῃ γῇ Ἰσραήλ, ὅτι εἶπον οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι, μὴ ποι- 20
ήσωσιν οἱ Ἑβραῖοι ῥομφαίαν καὶ δόρυ. Καὶ κατέβαινον πᾶς Ἰσ-
ραὴλ εἰς γῆν ἀλλοφύλων, χαλκεύειν ἕκαστος τὸ θεριστήριον αὑτοῦ
καὶ τὸ σκεῦος αὑτοῦ, καὶ ἕκαστος τὴν ἀξίνην αὑτοῦ καὶ τὸ δρέ- 21
πανον αὑτοῦ. Καὶ ἦν ὁ τρυγητὸς ἕτοιμος τοῦ θερίζειν· τὰ δὲ
σκευὴ ἦν τρεῖς σίκλοι εἰς τὸν ὀδόντα, καὶ τῇ ἀξίνῃ καὶ τῷ δρε-
πάνῳ ὑπόστασις ἦν ἡ αὐτή. Καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις τοῦ 22
πολέμου Μαχμάς, καὶ οὐχ εὑρέθη ῥομφαία καὶ δόρυ ἐν χειρὶ
παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ τοῦ μετὰ Σαοὺλ καὶ μετὰ Ἰωνάθαν καὶ εὑρέθη
τῷ Σαοὺλ καὶ τῷ Ἰωνάθαν υἱῷ αὑτοῦ. Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ἐξ ὑποστάσεως 23
τῶν ἀλλοφύλων εἰς τὸ πέραν Μαχμάς.

**2. Free and Highly Literary Translation:**

1 A son of a year was Saul when he began to reign; and two years he reigned over Israel.
2 And Saul chose for himself three thousand men out of the men of Israel; and two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in the mount of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. And the rest of the people he sent away, every man unto his own tent.
3 And Jonathan smote the Philistine garrison that was in the hill, and the Philistines heard thereof. And Saul caused a trumpet to sound throughout all the land, saying, "The servants have transgressed."
4 And all Israel heard them saying, "Saul hath smitten the Philistine garrison," and Israel was put to shame among the Philistines. And the people cried aloud after Saul in Gilgal.
5 And the Philistines gathered themselves together to war against Israel; and they came up against Israel with thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is upon the seashore in multitude. And they came up and encamped in Michmash, over against Bethoron to the south.
6 And when any man of Israel saw that it was straitened for them not to draw nigh, the people hid themselves in caves, and in folds, and in rocks, and in pits, and in cisterns.
7 And those who went forth passed over Jordan unto the land of Gad and Gilead. And Saul was yet in Gilgal, and all the people departed from him.
8 And he tarried seven days for the appointed testimony, as Samuel had said; yet Samuel came not to Gilgal, and the people were scattered from him.
9 And Saul said, "Bring hither that I may offer a burnt offering and peace offerings." And he offered up the burnt offering.
10 And it came to pass, as he had finished offering up the burnt offering, that Samuel came. And Saul went out to meet him, to salute him.
11 And Samuel said, "What hast thou done?" And Saul said, "Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not at the appointed testimony of the days, and that the Philistines were gathered together at Michmash,
12 I said, 'Now will the Philistines come down upon me to Gilgal, and I have not entreated the face of the LORD.' And I constrained myself and offered up the burnt offering."
13 And Samuel said unto Saul, "Thou hast acted foolishly, for thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which He commanded thee. For now would the LORD have established thy kingdom over Israel forever.
14 But now thy kingdom shall not stand for thee, and the LORD shall seek for Himself a man after His own heart, and the LORD shall appoint him to be ruler over His people, because thou hast not kept whatsoever the LORD commanded thee."
15 And Samuel arose and departed from Gilgal. And the remnant of the people went up after Saul unto a meeting, behind the people of war, they themselves having come from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul mustered the people that were found with him, about six hundred men.
16 And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were found with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin and wept. And the Philistines had encamped in Michmash.
17 And spoilers came forth from the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company looked toward the way of Ophrah, unto the land of Shual;
18 And another company looked toward the way of Bethoron; and the third company looked toward the way of Geba, which dips down unto Gai and the desert plain of Zeboim.
19 Now there was no smith of iron found throughout all the land of Israel, for the Philistines had said, "Lest the Hebrews make swords and spears."
20 But all Israel went down to the land of the Philistines, each man to forge his reaping hook and his implement, and each man his axe and his pruning hook.
21 And the vintage was ready for reaping. And the charge for the tools was three shekels for the edge; and for the axe and for the pruning hook the standing-charge was the same.
22 And it came to pass in the days of the battle of Michmash, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and with Jonathan. But they were found with Saul and with Jonathan his son.
23 And a garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.
