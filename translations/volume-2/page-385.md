and leaves of thick trees,
to make for them booths, according to that which was written.

<sup>16</sup> And the people went forth, and brought [them],
and made for themselves booths, every man upon his housetop,
and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God,
and in the broad places of the city,
and even unto the gate of Ephraim.

<sup>17</sup> And all the congregation of them that were returned out of the captivity
made booths, and sat in booths;
for since the days of Joshua, the son of Nun,
the children of Israel had not done so until that day.
And there was exceeding great gladness.

<sup>18</sup> And Ezra read in the book of the Law of God day by day,
from the first day unto the last day.
And they kept the feast seven days;
and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly,
according to the ordinance.

<sup>5</sup> And the Levites, Jeshua and Kadmiel, said:
"Arise, bless the Lord your God from everlasting to everlasting.
And they shall bless Thy glorious Name,
and they shall exalt [it] above all blessing and praise."

<sup>6</sup> And Ezra said:
"Thou art the Lord alone;
Thou hast made the heaven, and the heaven of heavens, with all their host;
the earth and all things that are therein,
the seas and all that is in them;
and Thou quickenest all things,
and the host of the heavens worshippeth Thee.

<sup>7</sup> Thou art the Lord God, Who didst choose Abram,
and broughtest him forth out of the land of the Chaldeans,
and gavest him the name Abraham.
