### 1 Kings

#### CHAPTER XIV.

**25** ...of King Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem;
**26** And he took the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; and the golden spears which David had taken from the hand of the servants of Adrazaar king of Zobah, he brought them into Jerusalem. He took all things; yea, he took the golden shields, even all that Solomon had made.
**27** And King Rehoboam made in their stead shields of bronze; and he entrusted them unto the hands of the chiefs of the guard, who kept the gate of the king's house.

**5** Because David did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and turned not aside from any thing that He commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.
**6** And there was war between Rehoboam and between Jeroboam all the days of their lives.
**7** Now the rest of the acts of Abijah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijah,
