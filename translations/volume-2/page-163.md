ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Γʹ.                   ΚΕΦ. ΙΕʹ.

22 σά, καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν ἐν αὐτοῖς ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἀσὰ πᾶν βουνὸν Βενιαμείν, καὶ τὴν σκοπιάν.
23 Καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Ἀσά, καὶ πᾶσα ἡ δυναστεία αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντα ἃ ἐποίησε, καὶ τὰς πόλεις ἃς ᾠκοδόμησεν, οὐχ ἰδοὺ ταῦτα γεγραμμένα ἐστὶν ἐπὶ βιβλίου λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν Ἰούδα; Πλὴν ἐν τῷ καιρῷ τοῦ γήρους αὐτοῦ ἐπόνεσε τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ.
24 Καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Ἀσὰ μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ, καὶ θάπτεται μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ ἐν πόλει Δαυὶδ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Ἰωσαφὰτ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ.
25 Καὶ Ναδὰβ υἱὸς Ἱεροβοὰμ βασιλεύει ἐπὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐν ἔτει δευτέρῳ τοῦ Ἀσὰ βασιλέως Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν ἐπὶ Ἰσραὴλ δύο ἔτη.
26 Καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ πονηρὸν ἐνώπιον Κυρίου, καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἐν ὁδῷ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις ἐξήμαρτε τὸν Ἰσραήλ.
27 Καὶ περικαθίσεν αὐτὸν Βαασὰ υἱὸς Ἀχιὰ ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον Ἰσαχάρ, καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτὸν Βαασὰ ἐν Γαβαθῶν τῇ τῶν ἀλλοφύλων· καὶ Ναδάβ, καὶ πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ περικάθητο ἐπὶ Γαβαθών.
28 Καὶ ἐθανάτωσεν αὐτὸν Βαασὰ ἐν ἔτει τρίτῳ Ἀσὰ βασιλέως Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ.
29 Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἐβασίλευσε, καὶ ἐπάταξε τὸν σύμπαντα οἶκον Ἱεροβοάμ, ἕως τοῦ ἐξολοθρεῦσαι αὐτόν, καὶ οὐχ ὑπελείπετο πᾶσαν πνοὴν τοῦ Ἱεροβοάμ, κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα Κυρίου ὃ ἐλάλησεν ἐν χειρὶ δούλου αὐτοῦ Ἀχιὰ τοῦ Σηλωνίτου,
30 περὶ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν Ἱεροβοάμ, ὃς ἥμαρτε, καὶ ὃς ἐξήμαρτε τὸν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐν τῷ παροργισμῷ αὐτοῦ ὡς παρώργισε τὸν Κύριον Θεὸν Ἰσραήλ.
31 Καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Ναδάβ, καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν, οὐχὶ ταῦτα γεγραμμένα ἐν βιβλίῳ λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν Ἰσραήλ;
32 Καὶ πόλεμος ἦν μεταξὺ Ἀσά, καὶ μεταξὺ Βαασὰ βασιλέως Ἰσραὴλ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας αὐτῶν.
33 Καὶ ἐν τῷ ἔτει τῷ τρίτῳ τοῦ Ἀσὰ βασιλέως Ἰούδα βασιλεύει Βαασὰ υἱὸς Ἀχιὰ ἐπὶ πάντα Ἰσραὴλ ἐν Θερσᾶ εἴκοσι καὶ τέσσαρα ἔτη.
34 Καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ πονηρὸν ἐνώπιον Κυρίου, καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἐν ὁδῷ Ἱεροβοὰμ υἱοῦ Ναβάτ, καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις αὐτοῦ ὡς ἐξήμαρτε τὸν Ἰσραήλ.

**22** ...and therewith King Asa did build all the hill country of Benjamin, and the watchtower.
**23** Now the rest of the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he wrought, and the cities which he built, are they not, behold, written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Nevertheless, in the time of his old age, he was diseased in his feet.
**24** And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead.
**25** And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah; and he reigned over Israel for two years.
**26** And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the way of his father, and in the sins whereby he made Israel to sin.
**27** And Baasha the son of Ahijah did set himself against him, concerning the house of Issachar; and Baasha smote him in Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab, and all Israel, were then besieging Gibbethon.
**28** And Baasha slew him in the third year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.
**29** And it came to pass, when he had begun to reign, that he smote all the house of Jeroboam, until he had destroyed it, and left not any living soul of Jeroboam, according to the word of the Lord, which He spake by the hand of His servant Ahijah the Shilonite,
**30** because of the sins of Jeroboam, who sinned, and who made Israel to sin, and for the provocation whereby he had provoked the Lord God of Israel.
**31** Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he wrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
**32** And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel throughout all their days.
**33** In the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha the son of Ahijah began to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, and reigned for four and twenty years.
**34** And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sins, by which he made Israel to sin.
