**Original Greek Text:**
**43** καὶ ἐσθιέτωσαν, ὅτι τάδε λέγει Κύριος· φάγονται, καὶ καταλείψουσι·

τὸ ῥῆμα Κυρίου.

**The Fourth Book of the Kings. Chapter Five.**

**1** Καὶ Ναιμὰν ὁ ἄρχων τῆς δυνάμεως τῆς Συρίας ἦν ἀνὴρ μέγας ἐνώπιον τοῦ κυρίου αὐτοῦ, καὶ τεθαυμασμένος προσώπῳ, ὅτι ἐν αὐτῷ ἔδωκε Κύριος σωτηρίαν τῇ Συρίᾳ· καὶ ὁ ἀνὴρ ἦν δυνατὸς ἰσχύϊ, λελεπρωμένος.
**2** Καὶ Συρία ἐξῆλθον μονόζωνοι, καὶ ἠχμαλώτευσαν ἐκ γῆς Ἰσραὴλ νεάνιδα μικράν, καὶ ἦν ἐνώπιον τῆς γυναικὸς Ναιμάν.
**3** Ἡ δὲ εἶπε τῇ κυρίᾳ αὐτῆς. Ὄφελον ὁ κύριός μου ἐνώπιον τοῦ προφήτου τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ· τότε ἀποσυνάξει αὐτὸν ἀπὸ τῆς λέπρας αὐτοῦ.
**4** Καὶ εἰσῆλθε, καὶ ἀπήγγειλε τῷ κυρίῳ ἑαυτῆς, καὶ εἶπεν οὕτως καὶ οὕτως ἐλάλησεν ἡ νεάνις ἡ ἐκ γῆς Ἰσραήλ.
**5** Καὶ εἶπε βασιλεὺς Συρίας πρὸς Ναιμὰν δεῦρο, εἴσελθε, καὶ ἐξαποστελῶ βιβλίον πρὸς βασιλέα Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη, καὶ ἔλαβεν ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ δέκα τάλαντα ἀργυρίου, καὶ ἑξακισχιλίους χρυσούς, καὶ δέκα ἀλλασσομένας στολάς·
**6** Καὶ ἤνεγκε τὸ βιβλίον πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Ἰσραήλ, λέγων· καὶ νῦν ὡς ἂν ἔλθῃ τὸ βιβλίον τοῦτο πρὸς σέ, ἰδοὺ ἀπέστειλα πρὸς σὲ Ναιμὰν τὸν δοῦλόν μου, καὶ ἀποσυνάξεις αὐτὸν ἐκ τῆς λέπρας αὐτοῦ.
**7** Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἀνέγνω ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ τὸ βιβλίον, διέρρηξε τὰ ἱμάτια ἑαυτοῦ, καὶ εἶπεν· ὁ Θεὸς ἐγὼ τοῦ θανατῶσαι, καὶ ζωοποιῆσαι, ὅτι οὗτος ἀποστέλλει πρὸς μὲ ἀποσυνάξαι ἄνδρα ἐκ τῆς λέπρας αὐτοῦ; ὅτι πλὴν γνῶτε δὴ καὶ ἴδετε, ὅτι προφασίζεται οὗτός μοι.
**8** Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἤκουσεν Ἐλισσαῖε ἄνθρωπος τοῦ Θεοῦ, ὅτι διέρρηξεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ τὰ ἱμάτια ἑαυτοῦ, καὶ ἀπέστειλε πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Ἰσραήλ, λέγων· ἱνατί διέρρηξας τὰ ἱμάτιά σου; ἐλθέτω δὴ πρὸς μὲ Ναιμάν, καὶ γνώτω ὅτι ἐστὶ προφήτης ἐν Ἰσραήλ.
**9** Καὶ ἦλθε Ναιμὰν ἐν ἵππῳ καὶ ἅρματι, καὶ ἔστη ἐπὶ τῆς θύρας τοῦ οἴκου Ἐλισσαῖε.
**10** Καὶ ἀπέστειλε πρὸς αὐτὸν Ἐλισσαῖε ἄγγελον, λέγων· πορευθεὶς λοῦσαι ἑπτάκις ἐν τῷ Ἰορδάνῃ, καὶ ἐπιστρέψει ἡ σάρξ σου σοι, καὶ καθαρισθήτῃ.
**11** Καὶ ἐθυμώθη Ναιμάν, καὶ ἀπῆλθε, καὶ εἶπεν· ἰδοὺ εἶπον, πρὸς μὲ πάντως ἐξελεύσεται, καὶ στήσεται, καὶ ἐπικαλέσεται ἐν ὀνόματι Κυρίου Θεοῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπιθήσει τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὸν τόπον, καὶ συνάξει τὸ

**THE FOURTH BOOK OF THE KINGS. CHAPTER FOUR.**

**43** "and let them eat; for thus saith the Lord: They shall eat, and shall leave [some]."
**44** And he set [it] before them; and they did eat, and left thereof, according to the word of the Lord.

**THE FOURTH BOOK OF THE KINGS. CHAPTER FIVE.**

**1** Now Naaman, the commander of the host of Syria, was a man great in valor before his master, and one much esteemed in presence; for by him the Lord had given deliverance unto Syria. And the man was mighty in strength, [but he was] a leper.

**2** And the Syrians had gone out in raiding bands, and had carried away captive out of the land of Israel a young maiden; and she stood before Naaman's wife.

**3** And she said unto her mistress, "Would that my lord were before the prophet of God who is in Samaria! Then would he remove from him his leprosy."

**4** And Naaman came in, and reported unto his lord, saying, "Thus and thus spoke the maiden who is from the land of Israel."

**5** Then the king of Syria said unto Naaman, "Go now, I pray thee, enter [my presence], and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel." And Naaman went, and took in his hand ten talents of silver, and six thousand [pieces of] gold, and ten changes of raiment.

**6** And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, "And now, when this letter shall come unto thee, behold, I have sent unto thee Naaman my servant, and thou shalt remove from him his leprosy."

**7** And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his garments, and said, "Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to remove a man from his leprosy? For know ye now and see, that he seeketh a quarrel against me."

**8** And it came to pass, when Elisha, the man of God, heard that the king of Israel had rent his garments, that he sent unto the king of Israel, saying, "Wherefore hast thou rent thy garments? Let Naaman come now unto me, and let him know that there is a prophet in Israel."

**9** So Naaman came with [his] horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.

**10** And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, "Go and wash thyself seven times in the Jordan, and thy flesh shall be restored unto thee, and thou shalt be cleansed."

**11** But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, "Lo, I thought, 'He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the Lord his God, and lay his hand upon the place, and remove the [leprosy]...'"
