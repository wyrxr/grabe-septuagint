1.2 ὙΠΟΛΑΒΩΝ δὲ Ἐλιφὰζ ὁ Θαιμανίτης, λέγει· πότερον σοφὸς
3 ἀπόκρισιν δώσει συνέσεως πνεύματος; ἐμπλήσει δὲ πόνον γαστρός,
ἐλέγχων (με) ἐν ῥήμασιν οἷς οὐ δεῖ, καὶ ἐν λόγοις οἷς οὐδὲν ὄφε-
4 λος; Ὅτι καί σου ἀπεποιήσω φόβον, συνετελέσω δὲ ῥήματα τοιαῦ-
5 τα ἔναντι Κυρίου· ἔνοχος εἶ ῥήμασι στόματός σου, καὶ οὐ διέκρι-
6 νας ῥήματα δυναστῶν. Ἐλέγξει σε τὸ σὸν στόμα, καὶ μὴ ἐγὼ,
7 τὰ δὲ χείλη σου καταμαρτυρήσει σου. Τί γάρ; μὴ πρῶτος ἄν-
8 θρωπος ἐγεννήθης; ἢ πρὸ θινῶν ἐπάγης; Ἢ σύνταγμα Κυρίου
9 ἀκήκοας; ἢ εἰς σὲ ἀφίκετο σοφία; Τί γὰρ οἶδας ὃ οὐκ οἴδαμεν;
10 ἢ τί σὺ νοήσεις ὃ οὐχὶ καὶ ἡμεῖς; Καίγε πρεσβύτης, καίγε πα-
11 λαιὸς ἐν ἡμῖν, βαρύτερος τοῦ πατρὸς σου ἡμέραις. Ὀλίγα ὧν
ἡμάρτηκας μεμαστίγωσαι· μεγάλως ὑπερβαλλόντως λελάληκας.
12 Τί (ὅτι) ἐτόλμησεν ἡ καρδία σου; ἢ τί (σοι) ὑπήνεγκαν οἱ ὀφθαλ-
13 μοί σου; Ὅτι θυμὸν ἐξέρρηξας ἔναντι Κυρίου, ἐξήγαγες δὲ ἐκ στό-
14 ματος ῥήματα τοιαῦτα. Τίς γὰρ ὢν βροτὸς, ὅτι ἔσται ἄμεμπτος,
15 ἢ ὡς ἐσόμενος δίκαιος γεννητὸς γυναικός; Εἰ κατὰ ἁγίων αὐτοῦ
οὐ πιστεύει, (μέμψις) ὁ οὐρανὸς δὲ οὐ καθαρὸς ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ,
16 (ἄστρα δὲ οὐκ ἄμεμπτα)· ἔα δὲ ἐβδελυγμένος καὶ ἀκάθαρτος ἀνὴρ,
17 πίνων ἀδικίαν ἴσα ποτῷ. Ἀναγγελῶ (οὖν) σοι, σὺ δέ μου ἄκουε·
18 ἃ δὲ ἑώρακα, ἀναγγελῶ σοι, ἃ σοφοὶ ἀνήγγειλαν, καὶ οὐκ ἔκρυ-
19 ψαν πατέρες αὐτῶν. Αὐτοῖς μόνοις ἐδόθη ἡ γῆ, καὶ οὐκ ἀπῆλθεν
20 ἀλλογενὴς ἐπ᾿ αὐτούς. Πᾶς ὁ βίος ἀσεβοῦς ἐν φροντίδι· ἔτη δὲ
21 ἀριθμητὰ δεδομένα δυνάστῃ, ὁ δὲ φόβος αὐτοῦ ἐν ὠσῖν αὐτοῦ· ὅταν
22 δοκῇ ἤδη εἰρηνεύεσθαι, τότε ἥξει ἡ καταστροφὴ αὐτοῦ. Μὴ πι-
στευέτω ἀποστραφῆναι ἀπὸ σκότους· ἐντέταλται γὰρ ἤδη εἰς χεῖ-
23 ρας σιδήρου, (καταπίπτει δὲ εἰς ἐξάλειψιν,) καὶ κατατέτακται εἰς
24 σῖτα γυψίν· οἶδε δὲ ἐν ἑαυτῷ ὅτι μένει εἰς πτῶμα. Ἡμέρα σκο-
τεινὴ φοβήσει αὐτὸν, ἀνάγκη δὲ καὶ θλῖψις αὐτὸν καθεῖ, ὥσπερ
25 στρατηγὸς πρωτοστάτης πεπτωκώς. Ὅτι ἦρκε χεῖρας ἔναντι Κυ-
26 ρίου, ἔναντι δὲ Κυρίου παντοκράτορος ἐτραχηλίασεν· ἔδραμε δὲ
27 ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ ὕβρει, ἐν τάχει νώτου ἀσπίδος αὐτοῦ· ὅτι ἐκάλυψε
τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἐν στέατι αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐποίησε περιστόμιον ἐπὶ
28 τῶν μηρῶν (αὐτοῦ· αἶνος δὲ αὐτοῦ ὕβρις.) Αὐλισθείη δὲ πόλεις

## CHAPTER XV.

**1** Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
**2** Doth a wise man render forth an answer wrought of the spirit of understanding?
**3** And fill his belly with pain, rebuking [me] with words that are unseemly, and with sayings wherein is no profit?
**4** For thou hast cast off fear, and hast uttered such words before the Lord.
**5** Thou art condemned by the words of thine own mouth, and hast not discerned the words of the Mighty One.
**6** Thine own mouth shall condemn thee, and not I; and thy lips shall testify against thee.
**7** What then? Wast thou born the first man? Or wast thou formed before the shores [of the sea]?
**8** Hast thou heard the ordinance of the Lord? Or hath wisdom come to thee alone?
**9** For what knowest thou, that we know not?
**10** Or what dost thou understand, which we also comprehend not?
**11** And verily, there is among us an aged man, yea, and one ancient, heavier than thy father in days. For the few things wherein thou hast sinned, thou hast been scourged; but greatly and exceedingly hast thou spoken.
**12** What [is it] that thy heart hath dared? Or what have thine eyes brought unto thee?
**13** For thou hast burst forth in wrath before the Lord, and hast brought forth such words out of thy mouth.
**14** For what mortal man, being [but dust], shall be blameless?
**15** Or how shall he that is born of woman be righteous? If in His holy ones He putteth not His trust, (though the heavens themselves are without blame,) and the heaven is not pure before Him,
**16** (And the stars are not blameless). Lo! then an abominable and impure man, who drinketh iniquity as [one drinketh] water!
**17** Therefore will I declare unto thee; but do thou give ear to me.
**18** And what I have seen, I will declare unto thee; that which wise men have shown forth, and their fathers have not concealed.
**19** To them alone was the earth given, and no stranger did pass among them.
**20** All the life of the ungodly man is in anxiety; and the years
**21** Numbered are [his allotted] years, given to the powerful one; and his fear is ever in his ears, when
**22** He imagineth himself to be at peace, then shall his destruction come. Let him not trust to escape from darkness;
**23** For he is already appointed unto the hands of iron, (and he falleth into utter destruction,) and is appointed for meat to vultures.
**24** And he knoweth within himself that he doth remain for a fall. A dark day shall put him in fear;
**25** And necessity and tribulation shall seize upon him, even as a chief commander that is fallen.
**26** Because he hath stretched forth his hands against the Lord, and before the Lord Almighty hath he stiffened his neck;
**27** And hath run against Him with insolence, with the swift boss of his shield; because he hath covered his face with his fat, and hath made a covering upon his thighs:
**28** (His very praise being but insolence.) He shall lodge in desolate cities, and shall enter into houses uninhabited;
