16 ἔθυσαν θυσίας ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ τῷ Κυρίῳ. Καὶ οἱ πέντε σατράπαι
τῶν ἀλλοφύλων ἑώρων καὶ ἀνέστρεψαν εἰς Ἀκκαρὼν ἐν
17 τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ. Καὶ αὗται αἱ ἕδραι αἱ χρυσαῖ, ἃς ἀπέδωκαν οἱ
ἀλλόφυλοι τῆς βασάνου τῷ Κυρίῳ· τῆς Ἀζώτου μίαν, τῆς Γάζης
18 μίαν, τῆς Ἀσκάλονος μίαν, τῆς Γὲθ μίαν, τῆς Ἀκκαρὼν μίαν. Καὶ
μῦς οἱ χρυσοῖ κατ᾿ ἀριθμὸν πασῶν τῶν πόλεων τῶν ἀλλοφύλων
τῶν πέντε σατραπῶν, ἐκ πόλεως ἐστερεωμένης καὶ ἕως κώμης
τοῦ Φερεζαίου, καὶ ἕως λίθου τοῦ μεγάλου, οὗ ἐπέθηκαν ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῦ
τὴν κιβωτὸν διαθήκης Κυρίου, (καὶ) ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης, τοῦ
19 ἐν ἀγρῷ Ἰησοῦ τοῦ Βεθσαμυσίτου. Καὶ οὐκ ἠσμένισαν υἱοὶ Ἰεχονίου
ἐν τοῖς ἀνδράσι Βεθσαμύς, ὅτι εἶδον κιβωτὸν Κυρίου· καὶ
ἐπάταξεν ἐν αὐτοῖς ἑβδομήκοντα ἄνδρας, καὶ πεντήκοντα χιλιάδας
ἀνδρῶν. Καὶ ἐπένθησεν ὁ λαός, ὅτι ἐπάταξε Κύριος ἐν τῷ λαῷ πληγὴν
20 μεγάλην σφόδρα. Καὶ εἶπαν οἱ ἄνδρες οἱ ἐκ Βεθσαμύς· τίς δυνήσεται
διελθεῖν ἐνώπιον Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ ἁγίου τούτου; καὶ
21 πρὸς τίνα ἀναβήσεται κιβωτὸς Κυρίου ἀφ᾿ ἡμῶν; Καὶ ἀποστέλλουσιν
ἀγγέλους πρὸς τοὺς κατοικοῦντας Καριαθιαρείμ, λέγοντες·
ἀπεστρόφασιν ἀλλόφυλοι τὴν κιβωτὸν Κυρίου, κατάβητε καὶ ἀναγάγετε
αὐτὴν πρὸς ἑαυτούς.

**ΚΕΦ. Ζ΄.** VII.

1 ΚΑΙ ἔρχονται οἱ ἄνδρες Καριαθιαρείμ, καὶ ἀνάγουσι τὴν
κιβωτὸν διαθήκης Κυρίου, καὶ εἰσάγουσιν αὐτὴν εἰς οἶκον Ἀμιναδάβ
τὸν ἐν τῷ βουνῷ· καὶ τὸν Ἐλεάζαρ υἱὸν αὐτοῦ ἡγίασαν φυλάσσειν
2 τὴν κιβωτὸν διαθήκης Κυρίου. Καὶ ἐγενήθη ἀφ᾿ ἧς ἡμέρας ἦν
ἡ κιβωτὸς ἐν Καριαθιαρείμ, ἐπληθύνθησαν αἱ ἡμέραι, καὶ ἐγένοντο εἴκοσιν
3 ἔτη· καὶ ἐπέβλεψε πᾶς ὁ οἶκος Ἰσραὴλ ὀπίσω Κυρίου. Καὶ εἶπε
Σαμουὴλ πρὸς πάντα οἶκον Ἰσραὴλ, λέγων· εἰ ἐν ὅλῃ καρδίᾳ ὑμῶν
ὑμεῖς ἐπιστρέφετε πρὸς Κύριον, περιέλετε τοὺς θεοὺς τοὺς ἀλλοτρίους
ἐκ μέσου ὑμῶν καὶ τὰ ἄλση, καὶ ἑτοιμάσατε τὰς καρδίας
ὑμῶν πρὸς Κύριον, καὶ δουλεύσατε αὐτῷ μόνῳ, καὶ ἐξελεῖται
4 ὑμᾶς ἐκ χειρὸς ἀλλοφύλων. Καὶ περιεῖλαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ
τὰς Βααλεὶμ καὶ τὰ ἄλση Ἀσταρώθ, καὶ ἐδούλευσαν τῷ Κυρίῳ
5 μόνῳ. Καὶ εἶπε Σαμουὴλ· ἀθροίσατε τὸν πάντα Ἰσραὴλ εἰς Μασσηφάθ,
6 καὶ προσεύξομαι περὶ ὑμῶν πρὸς Κύριον. Καὶ συνήχθη-

**Chapter 6**

16 And they offered sacrifices on that day unto the Lord. And the five satraps of the Philistines beheld [these things], and returned unto Akkarōn on that same day.

17 And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines rendered for the affliction unto the Lord: one for Azōtos, one for Gazē, one for Askalonos, one for Geth, and one for Akkarōn.

18 And the golden mice were according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines, of the five satraps, from the fortified city even unto the village of the Perizzite, and even unto the great stone whereon they laid the Ark of the covenant of the Lord (and) even unto this day, [which standeth] in the field of Joshua, the Bethsamysite.

19 And the sons of Jechoniah did not rejoice gladly among the men of Bethsamys, because they had seen the Ark of the Lord; and He smote among them seventy men, and fifty thousand men. And the people mourned, because the Lord had smitten the people with a very great plague.

20 And the men of Bethsamys said, "Who shall be able to stand before the Lord, this holy God? And unto whom shall the Ark of the Lord depart from us?"

21 And they send messengers unto those who dwell in Kariathiareim, saying, "The Philistines have returned the Ark of the Lord; come ye down and bring it up unto yourselves."

**Chapter 7**

1 And the men of Kariathiareim came, and brought up the Ark of the covenant of the Lord, and brought it into the house of Aminadab, who was on the hill; and they sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the Ark of the covenant of the Lord.

2 And it came to pass, from the day that the Ark was in Kariathiareim, that the days were multiplied, and they became twenty years; and all the house of Israel turned after the Lord.

3 And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, "If with all your heart ye turn unto the Lord, then remove the foreign gods from your midst and the groves, and prepare your hearts unto the Lord, and serve Him alone, and He shall deliver you from the hand of the Philistines."

4 And the sons of Israel removed the Baalim and the groves of Ashtaroth, and served the Lord alone.

5 And Samuel said, "Gather all Israel unto Massaphath, and I will pray for you unto the Lord."
