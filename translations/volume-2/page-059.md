**ΚΕΦ. ΚΖ΄. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Α΄. 535**
**5** Ἔνθεν ἐν λαμπήνῃ, καὶ ὁ λαὸς παρεμβεβληκὼς κύκλῳ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ
**6** ἀπεκρίθη Δαυίδ, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς ᾿Αβιμέλεχ τὸν Χετταῖον, καὶ πρὸς
᾿Αβισαὶ, υἱὸν Σαρουΐα, ἀδελφὸν ᾿Ιωάβ, λέγων· τίς εἰσελεύσεται
μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ πρὸς Σαοὺλ εἰς τὴν παρεμβολήν; καὶ εἶπεν ᾿Αβισαὶ,
**7** ἐγὼ εἰσπορεύσομαι μετὰ σοῦ. Καὶ εἰσπορεύεται Δαυὶδ καὶ ᾿Αβισαὶ
εἰς τὸν λαὸν τὴν νύκτα· καὶ ἰδοὺ Σαοὺλ καθεύδων ὕπνωσεν ἐν λαμ-
πήνῃ, καὶ τὸ δόρυ αὐτοῦ ἐντεπηγὸς εἰς τὴν γῆν πρὸς κεφαλῆς αὐ-
τοῦ, καὶ ᾿Αβεννὴρ καὶ ὁ λαὸς αὐτοῦ ἐκάθευδε κύκλῳ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ
**8** εἶπεν ᾿Αβισαὶ πρὸς Δαυίδ· ἀπέκλεισε Κύριος σήμερον τὸν ἐχθρόν
σου εἰς χεῖράς σου, καὶ νῦν πατάξω αὐτὸν τῷ δόρατι εἰς γῆν ἅ-
παξ, καὶ οὐ δευτερώσω αὐτῷ. Καὶ
**9** εἶπε Δαυὶδ πρὸς ᾿Αβισαί· μὴ
διαφθείρῃς αὐτὸν, ὅτι τίς ἐποίσει χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ χριστὸν Κυ-
ρίου καὶ ἀθωθήσεται; Καὶ
**10** εἶπε Δαυίδ· ζῇ Κύριος, ὅτι ἐὰν μὴ
Κύριος παίσῃ αὐτὸν, ἢ ἡμέρα αὐτοῦ ἔλθῃ καὶ ἀποθάνῃ, ἢ εἰς πό-
λεμον καταβῇ καὶ προστεθῇ,
**11** μηδαμῶς μοι παρὰ Κυρίου ἐπενεγ-
κεῖν χεῖρά μου ἐπὶ χριστὸν Κυρίου· καὶ νῦν λάβε δὴ τὸ δόρυ ἀπὸ
προσκεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ καὶ τὸν φιακὸν τοῦ ὕδατος, καὶ ἀπέλθωμεν καθ᾿
ἑαυτούς. Καὶ
**12** ἔλαβε Δαυὶδ τὸ δόρυ καὶ τὸν φιακὸν τοῦ ὕδατος ἀπὸ
προσκεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀπῆλθον καθ᾿ ἑαυτούς· καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ βλέ-
πων, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ γινώσκων, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ ἐξεγειρόμενος, πάν-
τες ὑπνοῦντες, ὅτι θάμβος Κυρίου ἔπεσεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῦς. Καὶ
**13** διέβη
Δαυὶδ εἰς τὸ πέραν, καὶ ἔστη ἐπὶ τὴν κορυφὴν τοῦ ὄρους μακρό-
θεν, καὶ πολλὴ ἡ ὁδὸς ἀναμέσον αὐτῶν. Καὶ
**14** προσεκαλέσατο Δαυὶδ
τὸν λαὸν, καὶ τῷ ᾿Αβεννὴρ ἐλάλησε, λέγων· οὐκ ἀποκριθῇ ᾿Α-
βεννὴρ; Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη ᾿Αβεννὴρ, καὶ εἶπε· τίς εἶ σὺ ὁ καλῶν με
πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα; Καὶ
**15** εἶπε Δαυὶδ πρὸς ᾿Αβεννὴρ· οὐχ ἀνὴρ σύ;
καὶ τίς, ὡς σὺ, ἐν ᾿Ισραήλ; καὶ διατὶ οὐ φυλάσσεις τὸν κύριον
σου τὸν βασιλέα ὅτι εἰσῆλθεν εἷς ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ διαφθεῖραι τὸν βα-
σιλέα τὸν κύριόν σου. Καὶ
**16** οὐκ ἀγαθὸν τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο, ὃ πεποί-
ηκας· ζῇ Κύριος, ὅτι υἱοὶ θανατώσεως ὑμεῖς, οἱ φυλάσσοντες τὸν
βασιλέα τὸν κύριον ἡμῶν τὸν χριστὸν Κυρίου. Καὶ νῦν ἴδε δὴ
τὸ δόρυ τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ ὁ φιακὸς τοῦ ὕδατος, ποῦ ἐστι τὰ πρὸς
κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ. Καὶ
**17** ἐπέγνω Σαοὺλ τὴν φωνὴν Δαυίδ, καὶ εἶπεν·
ἡ φωνή σου αὕτη, τέκνον Δαυίδ; καὶ εἶπε Δαυίδ· δοῦλός σου, κύ-
ριε βασιλεῦ, καὶ
**18** εἶπε Δαυίδ· ἵνατί τοῦτο ὁ κύριος καταδιώκει ὀ-
πίσω τοῦ δούλου αὐτοῦ; ὅτι τί ἡμάρτηκα; καὶ τί εὑρέθη ἐν ἐμοὶ

**5** there, by the lamplight, and the people were encamped in a circle about him.
**6** And David answered, and spake unto Abimelech the Hittite, and unto Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, saying, "Who shall go down with me unto Saul into the camp?" And Abishai said,
**7** "I will go in with thee." So David and Abishai went into the camp of the people by night; and behold, Saul lay fast asleep in the lamplight, and his spear was stuck in the ground at his head. And Abner and his people slept round about him.
**8** Then said Abishai unto David, "The LORD hath this day delivered thine enemy into thine hand; now therefore let me smite him with the spear to the earth but once, and I shall not need to strike him a second time."
**9** And David said to Abishai, "Destroy him not; for who can lay his hand upon the LORD's anointed, and be held guiltless?"
**10** And David said, "As the LORD liveth, unless the LORD Himself smite him, or his day shall come that he die, or he shall go down into battle and perish,
**11** [God forbid] that I should lay mine hand upon the LORD's anointed. And now, I pray thee, take thou the spear that is at his head, and the jar of water, and let us go our way unperceived."
**12** So David took the spear and the jar of water from Saul's head, and they departed unperceived. And there was none that saw it, nor none that knew it, neither any that awakened; for they were all asleep, because a deep slumber from the LORD had fallen upon them.
**13** Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of the mountain afar off; a great space being between them.
**14** And David called to the people, and to Abner he spake, saying, "Wilt thou not answer, Abner?" Then Abner answered and said, "Who art thou that dost call to the king?"
**15** And David said to Abner, "Art thou not a man? And who is like unto thee in Israel? Why then hast thou not kept watch over thy lord the king? For one of the people came in to destroy the king thy lord."
**16** "This thing which thou hast done is not good. As the LORD liveth, ye are sons of death, ye who guard the king our lord, the LORD's anointed. And now, I pray thee, see where is the king's spear, and the jar of water, which were at his head."
**17** And Saul knew David's voice, and said, "Is this thy voice, my son David?" And David said, "It is the voice of thy servant, my lord, O King."
**18** And David said, "Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant? For what evil have I committed? Or what transgression hath been found in me,
