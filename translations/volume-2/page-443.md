ἐμοῦ) ἐμακάρισάν με, καὶ γλῶσσα αὐτῶν τῷ λάρυγγι αὐτῶν
ἐκολλήθη· ὅτι οὓς ἤκουσε, καὶ ἐμακάρισέ με, ὀφθαλμὸς δέ με 11
ἰδὼν ἐξέκλινε. Διέσωσα γὰρ πτωχὸν ἐκ χειρὸς δυνάστου, καὶ 12
ὀρφανῷ, ᾧ οὐχ ὑπῆρχε βοηθός· ἐβοήθησα· εὐλογία ἀπολλυμέ- 13
νου ἐπ᾽ ἐμὲ ἔλθοι, στόμα δὲ χήρας ηὐλόγησέ με. Δικαιοσύνη 14
δὲ ἐνεδύκειν, ἡμφιασάμην δὲ κρῖμα ἴσα διπλοΐδι. Ὀφθαλμὸς ἦ- 15
μην τυφλῷ, ποῦς δὲ χωλῷ· ἐγὼ ἤμην πατὴρ ἀδυνάτων, δίκην 16
δὲ ἣν οὐκ ᾔδειν ἐξιχνίασα· συνέτριψα δὲ μύλας ἀδίκων, ἐκ δὲ 17
μέσου ὁδόντων αὐτῶν ἅρπαγμα ἐξέσπασα. Εἶπον δέ· ἡλικία μου 18
γηράσει ὡς περ στέλεχος φοίνικος, πολὺν (δὲ) χρόνον βιώσω· ἡ 19
ῥίζα μου διήνοικται ἐπὶ ὕδατος, καὶ δρόσος αὐλισθήσεται ἐπὶ
τῷ θερισμῷ μου· ἡ δόξα μου καινὴ μετ᾽ ἐμοῦ, καὶ τὸ τόξον μου 20
ἐν χειρί μου πορεύσεται. (Πρεσβύτεροι) ἀκούσαντές μου προσέ- 21
χον, ἐσιώπησαν δὲ ἐπὶ τῇ ἐμῇ βουλῇ· ἐπὶ (δὲ) τῷ ἐμῷ ῥήματι 22
οὐ προσέθεντο, καὶ περιχαρείς ἐγίνοντο ὁπότε αὐτοῖς ἐλάλουν·
ὥσπερ γῆ διψῶσα προσδεχομένη ὑετόν, οὕτως οὗτοι τὴν ἐμὴν 23
λαλιὰν (προσεδέχοιτο). Εἰ ἐγέλων πρὸς αὐτοὺς, οὐκ ἐπίστευον· 24
καὶ φῶς τοῦ προσώπου μου οὐκ ἀπέπιπτεν. Ἐξελεξάμην ὁδὸν 25
αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐκάθισα ἄρχων, καὶ κατεσκήνουν ὡσεὶ βασιλεὺς ἐν
μονοζώνοις, ἐν τρόπῳ πενθινοὺς παρακαλῶν.

ΚΕΦ. Λ´. XXX.

Νυνὶ δὲ κατεγέλασάν μου ἐλάχιστοι· νῦν νουθετοῦσί με 1
ἐν μέρει ἡμερῶν ὧν ἐξουδένουν τοὺς πατέρας αὐτῶν, οὓς οὐχ
ἡγησάμην ἀξίους εἶναι κυνῶν τῶν ἐμῶν νομάδων. Καί γε ἰσχὺς 2
χειρῶν αὐτῶν ἵνατί μοι; ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς ἀπώλετο συντέλεια. Ἐν ἐν- 3
δείᾳ καὶ λιμῷ ἄγονοι· οἳ φεύγοντες ἄνυδρον ἐχθὲς συνοχὴν
καὶ ταλαιπωρίαν· οἳ περικλῶντες ἅλιμα ἐπὶ ἠχοῦντι, (ὧν ἅλιμα 4.5
ἦν αὐτῶν τὰ σῖτα·) ἄτιμοί τε καὶ πεφαυλισμένοι, ἐνδεεῖς παν-
τὸς ἀγαθοῦ, οἳ καὶ ῥίζας ξύλων ἐμασῶντο ὑπὸ λιμοῦ μεγάλου.
Ἐπανέστησάν μοι κλέπται, ὧν οἱ οἶκοι αὐτῶν ἦσαν τρῶγλαι 6
τῶν πετρῶν· ἀναμέσον εὐήχων βοήσονται, οἳ ὑπὸ φρύγανα ἄγρια 7
διητῶντο· ἀφρόνων υἱοὶ καὶ ἀτίμων, ὄνομα καὶ κλέος ἐσβεσμέ- 8
νον ἀπὸ γῆς. Νυνὶ δὲ κιθάρα αὐτῶν ἐγώ εἰμι, καὶ ἐμὲ θρύλλη- 9
μα ἔχουσιν· ἐβδελύξαντό με ἀποστάντες μακράν, ἀπὸ δὲ προσώ- 10

## CHAPTER XXIX.

**11** (concerning me) did bless me; and their tongue did cleave to their throats; because those whom it heard, and did bless me, and an eye, seeing me, did turn [and bear witness].
**12** For I delivered the poor from the hand of the oppressor;
**13** and to the orphan, who had no helper, did I give aid. The blessing of him that was perishing would come upon me, and the mouth of the widow did bless me.
**14** Righteousness did I put on, and I did array myself with judgment as with a double cloak.
**15** I was an eye to the blind, and a foot to the lame;
**16** I was a father to the helpless, and the cause which I knew not, did I search out.
**17** And I did break the jaws of the unrighteous, and from the midst of their teeth did I pluck the prey.
**18** And I said: 'My age shall grow old as a palm tree's trunk,
**19** and a long (while) shall I live. My root is opened wide unto the water, and dew shall lodge upon
**20** my harvest. My glory is renewed with me, and my bow in my hand shall go forth.'
**21** (Elders) hearing me, did attend, and were silent at my counsel;
**22** and at (my) word they did not add [anything], and they became exceedingly joyful when I spake unto them;
**23** as thirsty ground expecting rain, so did these receive my speech (would they receive).
**24** If I smiled upon them, they believed it not;
**25** and the light of my countenance did not diminish. I chose their way,
**26** and sat as a ruler, and I did dwell as a king among those who were alone, comforting mourners.

## CHAPTER XXX.

**1** But now the least have mocked me; now they do admonish me in the portion of [these] days, [even they] whose fathers I did disdain,
**2** whom I did not account worthy to be with the dogs of my flock. And what strength of their hands is it to me?
**3** Upon them hath destruction fallen. In want and famine were they barren; who fled to the waterless [desert], yesterday having known distress and misery;
**4** who did pluck salt-herbs by an echoing [cliff], (whose salt-herbs were their food indeed;)
**5** and they were dishonored and made worthless, lacking all manner of good;
**6** who even gnawed the roots of trees by reason of a great famine. Thieves rose up against me, whose houses were caves
**7** of the rocks; among echoing [places] did they cry aloud, who dwelt beneath wild brushwood;
**8** sons of fools and of men dishonored, whose name and fame are utterly extinguished from the earth.
**9** But now I am become their lyre, and a byword have they made of me;
**10** they have abhorred me, standing afar off; and from my face
