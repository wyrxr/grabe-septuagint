[23:4 continued] καὶ ἐν Θεῷ φωτός.
[23:5] Τῇ πρωΐας, ἀνατεῖλαι ὁ Ἥλιος τὸ πρωΐ, οὐ παρῆλθεν ἐκ φέγγους, καὶ ὡς ἐξ ὑετοῦ χλόης ἀπὸ γῆς. Οὐ γὰρ οὕτως ὁ οἶκός μου μετὰ ἰσχυροῦ· διαθήκην γὰρ αἰώνιον ἑτοίμην ἔθετό μοι ἐν παντὶ καιρῷ πεφυλαγμένην· ὅτι πᾶσα σωτηρία μου καὶ πᾶν θέλημα, ὅτι οὐ μὴ βλαστήσῃ ὁ παράνομος.
[23:6] Ὥσπερ ἄκανθα ἐξωσμένη πάντες αὐτοῦ, ὅτι οὐ χειρὶ ληφθήσονται, καὶ ἀνὴρ οὐ κοπιάσει ἐν αὐτοῖς. Καὶ πλῆρες σιδήρου, καὶ ξύλον δόρατος, καὶ ἐν πυρὶ καύσει καὶ
[23:7] καυθήσεται αἰσχύνη αὐτῶν. Ταῦτα τὰ ὀνόματα τῶν δυνατῶν τοῦ Δαυΐδ· Ἰεσβοσθαΐ ὁ Χαναναῖος, ἄρχων τοῦ τρίτου (αὐτὸς) ἐστίν.
[23:9] Ἀδεινῶν ὁ Ἀσωναῖος, ἐπὶ ὀκτακοσίους τραυματίας εἰσάπαξ. Καὶ μετ᾿ αὐτὸν Ἐλεάζαρ, υἱὸς πατραδέλφου αὐτοῦ, υἱὸς Σουσεὶ τοῦ ἐν τοῖς τρισὶ δυνατοῖς μετὰ Δαυΐδ, ἐν τῷ ὀνειδίσαι αὐτὸν ἐν τοῖς ἀλλοφύλοις, συνήχθησαν ἐκεῖ εἰς πόλεμον, καὶ ἀνέβησεν ἀνὴρ Ἰσραήλ.
[23:10] Αὐτὸς ἀνέστη, καὶ ἐπάταξεν ἐν τοῖς ἀλλοφύλοις, ἕως οὗ ἐκόπασεν ἡ χεὶρ αὐτοῦ, καὶ προσεκολλήθη ἡ χεὶρ αὐτοῦ πρὸς τὴν μάχαιραν. Καὶ ἐποίησε Κύριος σωτηρίαν μεγάλην ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ·
[23:11] καὶ ὁ λαὸς ἐκάθητο ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ πλὴν ἐκδιδύσκειν. Καὶ μετ᾿ αὐτὸν Σαμμαίας, υἱὸς Ἀγολὰ, ὁ Ἀρχυγαῖος· καὶ συνήχθησαν οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι εἰς θηρία. Καὶ ἦν ἐκεῖ μερὶς τοῦ ἀγροῦ πλήρης φακοῦ.
[23:12] Καὶ ὁ λαὸς ἔφυγεν ἐκ προσώπου ἀλλοφύλων· καὶ ἐστηλώθη ἐν μέσῳ τῆς μερίδος, καὶ ἐξείλατο αὐτὴν, καὶ ἐπάταξε τοὺς ἀλλοφύλους.
[23:13] Καὶ ἐποίησε Κύριος σωτηρίαν μεγάλην. Καὶ κατέβησαν τρεῖς ἀπὸ τῶν τριάκοντα, καὶ κατέβησαν εἰς Κασωὰρ πρὸς Δαυΐδ εἰς τὸ σπήλαιον Ὀδολάμ· καὶ τάγμα τῶν ἀλλοφύλων παρενέβαλον ἐν τῇ κοιλάδι Ῥαφαείν.
[23:14] Καὶ Δαυΐδ τότε ἐν τῇ περιοχῇ, καὶ τὸ ὑπόστημα τῶν ἀλλοφύλων τότε ἐν Βηθλεέμ.
[23:15] Καὶ ἐπεθύμησε Δαυΐδ, καὶ εἶπε· τίς ποτιεῖ με ὕδωρ ἐκ τοῦ λάκκου τοῦ ἐν Βηθλεὲμ τοῦ ἐν τῇ πύλῃ; τὸ δὲ σύστημα τῶν ἀλλοφύλων τότε ἐν Βηθλεέμ.
[23:16] Καὶ διέρρηξαν οἱ τρεῖς δυνατοὶ ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ τῶν ἀλλοφύλων, καὶ ὑδρεύσαντο ὕδωρ ἐκ τοῦ λάκκου τοῦ ἐν Βηθλεὲμ τοῦ ἐν τῇ πύλῃ. Καὶ ἔλαβον, καὶ παρεγένοντο πρὸς Δαυΐδ, καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησε πιεῖν αὐτό.
[23:17] Καὶ ἔσπεισεν αὐτὸ τῷ Κυρίῳ, καὶ εἶπεν· ἵλεώς μοι, Κύριε, τοῦ ποιῆσαι τοῦτο, εἰ αἷμα τῶν ἀνδρῶν τῶν πορευθέντων ἐν ταῖς ψυχαῖς αὐτῶν πίομαι. Καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησε πιεῖν αὐτό.
[23:18] Ταῦτα ἐποίησαν οἱ τρεῖς δυνατοί. Καὶ Ἀβισαί, ἀδελφὸς Ἰωὰβ, υἱὸς Σαρουίας, αὐτὸς ἄρχων ἐν τοῖς τρισί,

**CHAPTER 23**

**4** And in God of light.
**5** In the morning, when the Sun ariseth in the morning, it doth not pass from its brightness, and as [the] grass from the earth [springeth forth] from the rain. Is not my house thus with the Mighty One? For an everlasting covenant, prepared, He hath made with me, preserved at every season; for all my salvation and all [my] desire [is this], that the lawless one shall not flourish.
**6** As thorns thrust away are all of them, for by hand shall they not be taken; and no man shall labour among them. But [one must be] fully [armed] with iron, and [with] a shaft of a spear; and with fire shall he burn [them], and
**7** their shame shall be consumed. These are the names of the mighty men of David: Jeshboshaï the Canaanite, chief of the three; he is.
**9** Adinon the Asonite, [who slew] eight hundred wounded at one time. And after him [was] Eleazar, the son of his paternal uncle, the son of Sousei, who was among the three mighty men with David. When he reproached him among the Philistines, they were gathered there for war, and a man of Israel
**10** rose up, and smote among the Philistines, until his hand grew weary, and his hand clave unto the sword. And the Lord wrought a great salvation in that day;
**11** and the people abode behind him, save for to strip [the slain]. And after him [was] Sammaias, the son of Agola, the Archygaeus; and the Philistines were gathered for wild beasts. And there was there a portion of a field full of lentils.
**12** And the people fled from the face of the Philistines; and he stood firm in the midst of the portion, and delivered it, and smote the Philistines.
**13** And the Lord wrought a great salvation. And three of the thirty went down, and went down to Kasōar unto David, into the cave of Odolam; and a troop of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Raphaim.
**14** And David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.
**15** And David longed, and said, "Who shall give me water to drink from the well that is in Bethlehem, which is by the gate?" Now the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.
**16** And the three mighty men brake through the camp of the Philistines, and drew water from the well that is in Bethlehem, which is by the gate. And they took [it], and came unto David, and he would not drink it.
**17** And he poured it out unto the Lord, and said, "Far be it from me, O Lord, to do this thing, [lest] I should drink the blood of the men who went forth with their lives." And he would not drink it.
**18** These things did the three mighty men. And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Saruiah, he was chief among the three,
