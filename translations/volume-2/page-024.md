ΚΕΦ. ΙΑ΄.
3 Καὶ λεγουσιν αὐτῷ οἱ ἄνδρες Ἰαβείς· ἄνες ἡμῖν ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας,
4 σώζων ἡμᾶς, καὶ ἐξελευσόμεθα πρὸς ὑμᾶς. Καὶ ἔρχονται οἱ ἄγγελοι εἰς Γαβαὰ πρὸς Σαούλ, καὶ λαλοῦσι τοὺς λόγους εἰς τὰ
ὦτα τοῦ λαοῦ· καὶ ἦραν πᾶς ὁ λαὸς τὴν φωνὴν αὑτῶν, καὶ ἔκλαυσαν.
5 Καὶ ἰδοὺ Σαοὺλ ἤρχετο μετὰ τὸ πρωΐ ἐξ ἀγροῦ, καὶ εἶπε Σαούλ· τί ὁ λαὸς ὅτι κλαίει; καὶ διηγοῦνται αὐτῷ τὰ ῥήματα τῶν ἀνδρῶν Ἰαβείς.
6 Καὶ ἐφήλατο πνεῦμα Κυρίου ἐπὶ Σαοὺλ ὡς ἤκουσε τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα, καὶ ἐθυμώθη ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς ὀργὴ αὐτοῦ σφόδρα.
7 Καὶ ἔλαβε δύο βόας, καὶ ἐμέλισεν αὐτάς, καὶ ἀπέστειλεν εἰς πᾶν ὅριον Ἰσραὴλ ἐν χειρὶ ἀγγέλων (αὐτῶν), λέγων· ὅς οὐκ ἔστιν ἐκπορευόμενος ὀπίσω Σαοὺλ καὶ ὀπίσω Σαμουήλ, κατὰ τάδε ποιήσουσι τοῖς βουσὶν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐπῆλθεν ἔκστασις Κυρίου ἐπὶ τὸν λαὸν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐβόησαν ὡς ἀνὴρ εἷς.
8 Καὶ ἐπισκέπτεται αὐτοὺς ἐν Βεζέκ, πάντα ἄνδρα Ἰσραὴλ ἑξακοσίας χιλιάδας.
9 Καὶ εἶπε τοῖς ἀγγέλοις τοῖς ἐρχομένοις· τάδε ἐρεῖτε τοῖς ἀνδράσιν Ἰαβεὶς Γαλαάδ· αὔριον ἔσται ὑμῖν ἡ σωτηρία διαθερμάναντος τοῦ ἡλίου. Καὶ ἦλθον οἱ ἄγγελοι εἰς τὴν πόλιν καὶ
10 ἀπαγγέλλουσι τοῖς ἀνδράσιν Ἰαβείς, καὶ ηὐφράνθησαν. Καὶ εἶπαν οἱ ἄνδρες Ἰαβεὶς πρὸς Νάας τὸν Ἀμανίτην· αὔριον ἐξελευσόμεθα πρὸς ὑμᾶς, καὶ ποιήσετε ἡμῖν τὸ ἀγαθὸν ἐνώπιον ὑμῶν.
11 Καὶ ἐγενήθη μετὰ τὴν αὔριον, καὶ ἔθετο Σαοὺλ τὸν λαὸν εἰς τρεῖς ἀρχάς, καὶ εἰσπορεύονται εἰς μέσον τῆς παρεμβολῆς ἐν φυλακῇ τῇ πρωϊνῇ, καὶ ἔπληξαν τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἀμμὼν ἕως διεθερμάνθη ἡ ἡμέρα. Καὶ ἐγενήθη καὶ οἱ ὑπολελειμμένοι διεσπάρησαν, καὶ οὐχ
12 ὑπελείφθησαν ἐν αὐτοῖς δύο κατὰ τὸ αὐτό. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ λαὸς πρὸς Σαμουήλ· τίς ὁ εἶπας ὅτι Σαοὺλ οὐ βασιλεύσει ἡμῶν; παράδος τοὺς ἄνδρας, καὶ θανατώσομεν αὐτούς.
13 Καὶ εἶπε Σαούλ· οὐκ ἀποθανεῖται οὐδεὶς ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ταύτῃ, ὅτι σήμερον ἐποίησε Κύριος σωτηρίαν ἐν Ἰσραήλ.
14 Καὶ εἶπε Σαμουὴλ πρὸς τὸν λαόν, λέγων· πορευθῶμεν εἰς Γάλγαλα, καὶ ἐγκαινίσωμεν ἐκεῖ τὴν βασιλείαν.
15 Καὶ ἐπορεύθη πᾶς ὁ λαὸς εἰς Γάλγαλα, καὶ ἔχρισεν Σαμουὴλ ἐκεῖ εἰς βασιλέα τὸν Σαοὺλ ἐνώπιον Κυρίου ἐν Γαλγάλοις· καὶ ἔθυσαν ἐκεῖ θυσίας καὶ εἰρηνικὰς ἐνώπιον Κυρίου, καὶ ηὐφράνθη Σαμουὴλ ἐκεῖ καὶ πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ ἕως τε λίαν.

**1 Kings, Chapter 11**

3 And the men of Jabesh said unto him, "Grant us seven days,
4 [that salvation may be wrought for us], and then we will come forth unto you." And the messengers came unto Gibeah to Saul, and spake these words in the ears of the people; and all the people lifted up their voice, and wept.
5 And behold, Saul came after the morning from the field, and Saul said, "What aileth the people, that they weep?" And they recounted unto him the words of the men of Jabesh.
6 And the Spirit of the Lord leapt upon Saul when he heard these words, and his wrath against them was kindled exceedingly.
7 And he took two oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hand of messengers (of their own), saying, "Whosoever goeth not forth after Saul and after Samuel, even so shall it be done unto his oxen." And the terror of the Lord came upon the people of Israel, and they cried out as one man.
8 And he mustered them in Bezek, all the men of Israel, six hundred thousand.
9 And he said unto the messengers who had come, "Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabesh-Gilead: 'Tomorrow shall deliverance come unto you, when the sun waxeth hot.'" And the messengers came into the city and
10 declared unto the men of Jabesh, and they rejoiced. And the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash the Ammonite, "Tomorrow will we come forth unto you, and ye shall do with us that which is good in your sight."
11 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Saul set the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and they smote the sons of Ammon until the day grew hot. And it came to pass that the remnant were scattered, and there remained not
12 two of them together. And the people said unto Samuel, "Who is he that said, 'Shall Saul not reign over us?' Deliver up the men, that we may put them to death!"
13 And Saul said, "There shall no man be put to death this day, for today the Lord hath wrought salvation in Israel."
14 Then said Samuel unto the people, saying, "Come, let us go to Gilgal, and there let us renew the kingdom."
15 And all the people went to Gilgal, and there Samuel anointed Saul king before the Lord in Gilgal; and they offered there sacrifices and peace offerings before the Lord, and Samuel rejoiced there, and all Israel with him, even exceedingly.
