θῆσαι εἰς τοὺς ἱερεῖς Κυρίου. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τῷ Δωὴκ˙ 18
ἐπιστρέφου σὺ, καὶ ἀπάντα˙ εἰς τοὺς ἱερεῖς˙ καὶ ἐπεστράφη
Δωὴκ ὁ Σύρος, καὶ ἐθανάτωσε τοὺς ἱερεῖς Κυρίου ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ
ἐκείνῃ, τριακοσίους καὶ πέντε ἄνδρας, πάντας αἴροντας Ἐφοὺδ
λίνον. Καὶ τὴν Νοβᾶ τὴν πόλιν τῶν ἱερέων ἐπάταξεν ἐν στόματι 19
ῥομφαίας ἀπὸ ἀνδρὸς ἕως γυναικὸς ἀπὸ νηπίου ἕως θηλάζοντος,
καὶ μόσχου, καὶ ὄνου, καὶ προβάτου. Καὶ διασώζεται υἱὸς εἷς 20
τῷ Ἀχιμέλεχ υἱῷ Ἀχιτὼβ, καὶ ὄνομα Ἀβιάθαρ, καὶ ἔφυγεν ὀπίσω
Δαυΐδ˙ καὶ ἀπήγγειλεν Ἀβιάθαρ τῷ Δαυΐδ, ὅτι ἐθανάτωσε 21
Σαοὺλ πάντας τοὺς ἱερεῖς τοῦ Κυρίου. Καὶ εἶπε Δαυΐδ τῷ Ἀβιάθαρ˙ 22
ἤδειν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, ὅτι Δωὴκ ὁ Σύρος ὅτι ἀπαγγέλλων ἀπαγγελει̃
τῷ Σαούλ˙ ἐγώ εἰμι αἴτιος τῶν ψυχῶν (ἐκείνων) οἴκου τοῦ πατρός σου˙
κάθου μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ˙ μὴ φοβοῦ, ὅτι οὐκ ἐὰν 23
ζητῶ τῇ ψυχῇ μου τόπον, ζητήσω καὶ τῇ ψυχῇ σου, ὅτι πεφύλαξαι
σὺ παρ᾿ ἐμοί.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΓ´. ΧΧΙΙΙ.

ΚΑΙ ἀπηγγέλη τῷ Δαυΐδ, λέγοντες˙ Ἰδοὺ οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι πολεμοῦσιν 1
ἐν τῇ Κεειλᾷ, καὶ αὐτοὶ διαρπάζουσι τοὺς ἅλωνας. Καὶ ἐπηρώτησε 2
Δαυΐδ διὰ τοῦ Κυρίου, λέγων˙ εἰ πορευθῶ, καὶ πατάξω τοὺς
ἀλλοφύλους τούτους˙ Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Δαυΐδ˙ πορεύου, καὶ
κατάξεις ἐν τοῖς ἀλλοφύλοις τούτοις, καὶ σώσεις τὴν
Κεειλά. Καὶ εἶπαν οἱ ἄνδρες τοῦ Δαυΐδ πρὸς αὐτόν˙ Ἰδοὺ ἡμεῖς 3
ἐνταῦθα ἐν τῇ Ἰουδαίᾳ φοβούμεθα, καὶ πῶς ἔσται ἐὰν πορευθῶμεν
ἐν Κεειλᾷ, εἰς τὰ σκῦλα τῶν ἀλλοφύλων εἰ πορευόμεθα;
Καὶ προσέθετο ἔτι Δαυΐδ ἐρωτῆσαι διὰ τοῦ Κυρίου καὶ ἀπεκρίθη 4
αὐτῷ Κύριος, καὶ εἶπεν˙ ἀνάστηθι (πρὸς αὐτόν), καὶ κατάβηθι εἰς
Κεειλὰ, ὅτι ἐγὼ παραδίδωμι τοὺς ἀλλοφύλους εἰς χεῖράς σου. Καὶ 5
ἐπορεύθη Δαυΐδ καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες οἱ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ εἰς Κεειλὰ, καὶ ἐπολέμησεν
ἐν τοῖς ἀλλοφύλοις˙ καὶ ἔφυγον ἐκ προσώπου αὐτοῦ, καὶ
(οὐκ) ἀπήγαγε τὰ κτήνη αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπάταξεν ἐν αὐτοῖς πληγὴν
μεγάλην, καὶ ἔσωσε Δαυΐδ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας Κεειλά. Καὶ ἐγένετο 6
ἐν τῷ φεύγειν Ἀβιάθαρ υἱὸν Ἀχιμέλεχ πρὸς Δαυΐδ, καὶ αὐτὸς
μετὰ Δαυΐδ εἰς Κεειλὰ, ἔχων Ἐφοὺδ ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ 7
ἀπηγγέλη τῷ Σαούλ, ὅτι ἥκει ὁ Δαυΐδ εἰς Κεειλὰ, καὶ εἶπε Σαούλ· οὐχ᾽
πέπρακεν αὐτὸν ὁ Θεὸς εἰς χεῖράς μου, ὅτι ἀποκέκλεισται
εἰσελθὼν εἰς πόλιν θυρῶν καὶ μοχλῶν.

**CHAPTER 22.**

**18** the servants of the Lord. And the king said unto Doeg, "Turn thou, and fall upon the priests." And Doeg the Syrian turned himself, and he slew the priests of the Lord on that day, even three hundred and five men, all of them bearing a linen ephod.
**19** And Nob, the city of the priests, he smote with the edge of the sword, both man and woman, both infant and suckling, and ox, and ass, and sheep.
**20** And there escaped one son unto Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, whose name was Abiathar, and he fled after David.
**21** And Abiathar declared unto David that Saul had slain all the priests of the Lord.
**22** And David said unto Abiathar, "I knew it on that day, that Doeg the Syrian, that reporting he would report it unto Saul. I am the cause of the souls (even of those ones) of the house of thy father.
**23** Abide thou with me; fear not; for whensoever I shall seek a place for my life, then will I seek also a place for thy life, for thou hast been kept safe with me."

**CHAPTER 23.**

**1** And it was told unto David, saying, "Behold, the Philistines wage war against Keilah, and they themselves plunder the threshing floors."
**2** And David inquired of the Lord, saying, "Shall I go and smite these Philistines?" And the Lord said unto David, "Go, and thou shalt bring low these Philistines, and thou shalt save Keilah."
**3** And the men of David said unto him, "Behold, we are here in Judah, and we are afraid; and how shall it be if we go into Keilah, unto the spoils of the Philistines, if indeed we shall go?"
**4** And David added yet again to inquire of the Lord. And the Lord answered him and said, "Arise [unto him], and go down into Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thy hands."
**5** So David went, and the men that were with him, into Keilah, and he waged war against the Philistines. And they fled from before his face, and he did not lead away their cattle, and he smote among them a great slaughter. And David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.
**6** And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled unto David, that he was with David in Keilah, having an ephod in his hand.
**7** And it was told unto Saul, that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, "Hath not God delivered him into my hands? For he is shut in, having entered a city of gates and bars."
