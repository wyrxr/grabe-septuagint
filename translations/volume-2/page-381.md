<sup>14</sup> τῶν προφητῶν, οἳ ἦσαν φοβερίζοντές με.
<sup>15</sup> Καὶ ἐτελέσθη τὸ τεῖχος πέμπτῃ καὶ εἰκάδι τοῦ Ἐλούλ, εἰς πεντήκοντα καὶ δύο ἡμέρας.
<sup>16</sup> Καὶ ἐγένετο ἡνίκα ἤκουσαν πάντες οἱ ἐχθροὶ ἡμῶν, καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν πάντα τὰ ἔθνη τὰ κύκλῳ ἡμῶν, καὶ ἔπεσε φόβος σφόδρα ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔγνωσαν ὅτι παρὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν ἐγενήθη τελειωθῆναι τὸ ἔργον τοῦτο.
<sup>17</sup> Καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις ἀπὸ πολλῶν ἐντίμων Ἰούδα ἐπιστολαὶ ἐπορεύοντο πρὸς Τωβίαν, καὶ αἱ Τωβία ἔρχοντο πρὸς αὐτούς· ὅτι πολλοὶ ἐν Ἰούδᾳ ἔνορκοι ἦσαν αὐτῷ, ὅτι γαμβρὸς ἦν τοῦ Σεχενία υἱοῦ Ἡραέ· καὶ Ἰωνάθαν υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἔλαβε τὴν θυγατέρα Μεσουλάμ υἱοῦ Βαραχία εἰς γυναῖκα.
<sup>18</sup> καὶ τοὺς λόγους αὐτοῦ ἦσαν λέγοντες πρὸς μέ, καὶ λόγους μου ἦσαν ἐκφέροντες αὐτῷ. καὶ ἐπιστολὰς ἀπέστειλε Τωβίας φοβερίσαι με.

<sup>1</sup> ΚΑὶ ἐγένετο ἡνίκα ᾠκοδομήθη τὸ τεῖχος, καὶ ἔστησα τὰς θύρας, καὶ ἐπεσκέπησαν οἱ πυλωροί, καὶ οἱ ἄδοντες, καὶ οἱ Λευῖται.
<sup>2</sup> Καὶ ἐνετειλάμην τῷ Ἀνανία ἀδελφῷ μου, καὶ τῷ Ἀνανία ἄρχοντι τῆς Βειρὰ ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, ὅτι αὐτὸς ἦν ὡς ἀνὴρ ἀληθὴς καὶ φοβούμενος τὸν Θεὸν παρὰ πολλούς·
<sup>3</sup> καὶ εἶπον αὐτοῖς, οὐκ ἀνοιγήσονται πύλαι Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἕως ἅμα τῷ ἡλίῳ· καὶ ὅτι αὐτῶν ἔτι γρηγορούντων, κλειέσθωσαν αἱ θύραι, καὶ σφηνούσθωσαν καὶ στῆσον προφύλακας οἰκούντων ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, ἀνὴρ ἐν προφυλακῇ ἑαυτοῦ, καὶ ἀνὴρ ἀπέναντι οἰκίας ἑαυτοῦ.
<sup>4</sup> Καὶ ἡ πόλις πλατεῖα καὶ μεγάλη, καὶ ὁ λαὸς ὀλίγος ἐν αὐτῇ, καὶ οὐκ ἦσαν οἰκίαι οἰκοδομημέναι.
<sup>5</sup> Καὶ ἔδωκεν ὁ Θεὸς εἰς τὴν καρδίαν μου, καὶ συνῆξα τοὺς ἐντίμους καὶ τοὺς ἄρχοντας καὶ τὸν λαὸν εἰς συνοδίας, καὶ εὗρον βιβλίον τῆς συνοδίας οἱ ἀνέβησαν ἐν πρώτοις· καὶ εὗρον γεγραμμένον ἐν αὐτῷ,

<sup>14</sup> of the prophets, who sought to make me afraid.
<sup>15</sup> And the wall was finished on the fifth and twentieth day of [the month] Elul, in fifty and two days.
<sup>16</sup> And it came to pass, when all our enemies heard thereof, and all the nations that were about us feared, and exceeding fear fell upon their eyes; and they knew that this work was wrought by our God.
<sup>17</sup> Moreover, in those days, many noblemen of Judah sent letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them; for many in Judah were bound unto him by oath, because he was the son-in-law of Shechaniah, the son of Arah; and Jonathan his son had taken the daughter of Meshullam, the son of Berechiah, to wife.
<sup>18</sup> And they spake his words before me, and carried forth my words unto him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.

#### CHAPTER VII.

And set ye watchmen from among the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every man in his watch, and every man over against his own house."
<sup>4</sup> Now the city was wide and great, but the people therein were few, and the houses were not yet builded.
<sup>5</sup> And my God put it into mine heart, and I gathered together the noblemen, and the rulers, and the people to be enrolled by genealogies. And I found a book of the genealogy of them which came up first; and I found written therein:
<sup>6</sup> "These are the children of the province that went up out of the captivity of the colony, whom Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, had carried away, and who returned unto Jerusalem and unto Judah, every man unto his own city; even with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Ezra, Reelaiah, Nahum, Baanah, Mispar, the men of the people of Israel."
<sup>7</sup> The children of Pharos, two thousand, one hundred, and seventy-
