ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Γ. ΚΕΦ. ΙΗʹ.
26 καὶ πῦρ μὴ ἐπιθῆτε. Καὶ ἔλαβον τὸν μόσχον ὃν ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς,
καὶ ἐποίησαν, καὶ ἐπεκαλοῦντο ἐν ὀνόματι τοῦ Βάαλ ἐκ πρωΐθεν
ἕως μεσημβρίας, καὶ εἶπον· ἐπάκουσον ἡμῶν, ὁ Βάαλ, ἐπάκου-
σον ἡμῶν· καὶ οὐκ ἦν φωνή, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἀκρόασις· καὶ διέτρεχον
27 ἐπὶ τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου οὗ ἐποίησαν. Καὶ ἐγένετο μεσημβρία, καὶ ἐμυκτήρισεν
αὐτοὺς Ἠλιοὺ ὁ Θεσβίτης, καὶ εἶπεν· ἐπικαλεῖσθε ἐν
φωνῇ μεγάλῃ· ὅτι θεός ἐστιν, ὅτι ἀδολεσχία αὐτῷ ἐστιν, καὶ ἅμα
μή ποτε χρηματίζει αὐτὸς ἢ μή ποτε καθεύδει αὐτὸς, καὶ ἐξαναστήσεται.
28 Καὶ ἐπεκαλοῦντο ἐν φωνῇ μεγάλῃ, καὶ κατετέμνοντο κατὰ τὸ κρῖμα αὐ-
τῶν ἐν μαχαίραις καὶ ἐν σειρομάσταις, ἕως ἐκχύσεως αἵματος ἐπ᾿
29 αὐτούς. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς παρῆλθε τὸ δειλινὸν, καὶ ἐπροφήτευσαν ὡς ὁ
καιρὸς τοῦ ἀναβῆναι τὴν θυσίαν, καὶ οὐκ ἦν φωνή, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἀκρόασις.
Καὶ ἐλάλησεν Ἠλιοὺ ὁ Θεσβίτης πρὸς τοὺς προφήτας τῶν προσοχθι-
σμάτων, λέγων· μετάστητε ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν, κἀγὼ ποιήσω τὸ ὁλο-
30 καύτωμά μου· καὶ μετέστησαν, καὶ ἀπῆλθον. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἠλιοὺ πρὸς
τὸν λαόν· προσαγάγετε πρὸς μέ· καὶ προσήγαγε πᾶς ὁ λαὸς
πρὸς αὐτὸν, καὶ ἰάσατο τὸ θυσιαστήριον Κυρίου τὸ κατεσκαμμέ-
31 νον. Καὶ ἔλαβεν Ἠλιοὺ δώδεκα λίθους κατὰ ἀριθμὸν φυλῶν τοῦ
Ἰακώβ, ᾧ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς αὐτὸν, λέγων· Ἰσραὴλ ἔσται τὸ
32 ὄνομά σου. Καὶ ᾠκοδόμησε τοὺς λίθους ἐν ὀνόματι Κυρίου, καὶ ἐποίησε
θάλασσαν χωροῦσαν δύο μετρητὰς σπέρματος κυκλόθεν τοῦ
33 θυσιαστηρίου. Καὶ ἐστοίβασε τὰς σχίδρακας ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον ὃ
ἐποίησε, καὶ ἐμέλισε τὸ ὁλοκαύτωμα, καὶ ἐπέθηκεν ἐπὶ τὰς σχί-
34 δρακας, καὶ ἐστοίβασεν ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον. Καὶ εἶπε· λάβετέ μοι
τέσσαρας ὑδρίας ὕδατος, καὶ ἐπιχέετε ἐπὶ τὸ ὁλοκαύτωμα, καὶ
ἐπὶ τὰς σχίδρακας. Καὶ εἶπε· δευτερώσατε· καὶ ἐδευτέρωσαν· καὶ
35 εἶπε· τρισσώσατε· καὶ ἐτρίσσωσαν. Καὶ διεπορεύετο τὸ ὕδωρ κύ-
κλῳ τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου, καὶ τὴν θάλασσαν ἔπλησαν ὕδατος. Καὶ
36 ἐγένετο, κατὰ ἀνάβασιν τοῦ δώρου, καὶ ἀνεβόησεν Ἠλιοὺ εἰς τὸν
οὐρανὸν, καὶ εἶπε· Κύριε ὁ Θεὸς Ἀβραὰμ, καὶ Ἰσαὰκ, καὶ Ἰσραὴλ,
σήμερον γνώτωσαν, ὅτι σὺ εἶ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραὴλ, κἀγὼ
37 δοῦλός σου, καὶ διὰ σὲ πεποίηκα τὰ ἔργα ταῦτα. Ἐπάκουσόν μου,
Κύριε, ἐπάκουσόν μου, καὶ γνώτωσαν ὁ λαὸς οὗτος, ὅτι σὺ εἶ Κύ-
ριος ὁ Θεὸς (μόνος), καὶ σὺ ἐπέστρεψας τὴν καρδίαν τοῦ λαοῦ
38 τούτου ὀπίσω. Καὶ ἔπεσε πῦρ παρὰ Κυρίου ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ
κατέφαγε τὰ ὁλοκαυτώματα, καὶ τὰς σχίδρακας, καὶ τοὺς λίθους,

**26** —and put no fire [under it]. And they took the calf which he had given them, and prepared it, and called upon the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, "Hear us, O Baal, hear us!" But there was no voice, nor any [who did] hear; and they leaped upon the altar which they had made.
**27** And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah the Tishbite mocked them, and said, "Cry aloud! For he is a god; for a long discourse [occupies] him, and perchance he is holding converse himself, or peradventure he sleepeth, and shall awake."
**28** And they cried aloud with a great voice, and cut themselves after their custom with knives and with scourges, till the blood gushed out upon them.
**29** And it came to pass, when the afternoon was past, and they prophesied until the time of the ascending of the offering, that there was no voice, nor any [who did] hear. Then Elijah the Tishbite spake unto the prophets of the abominations, saying, "Stand aside from now, and I will make my burnt offering." And they stood aside, and went away.
**30** And Elijah said unto the people, "Come near unto me." And all the people came near unto him; and he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down.
**31** And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of Jacob, unto whom the Lord spake, saying, "Israel shall be thy name."
**32** And he built the stones in the name of the Lord; and he made a trench [around] the altar, holding two measures of seed.
**33** And he piled the wood upon the altar which he had made, and cut the burnt offering in pieces, and laid it on the wood, and piled it upon the altar.
**34** And he said, "Take for me four pitchers of water, and pour [it] on the burnt offering, and on the wood." And he said, "Do it a second time." And they did it a second time. And he said, "Do it a third time." And they did it a third time.
**35** And the water ran round about the altar, and they filled the trench with water.
**36** And it came to pass, at the time of the ascending of the offering, that Elijah cried aloud unto Heaven, and said, "O Lord God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, let them know this day that Thou art the Lord God of Israel, and that I am Thy servant, and that by Thy word I have done all these things.
**37** Hear me, O Lord, hear me! And let this people know that Thou art the Lord God [alone], and that Thou hast turned back the heart of this people [unto Thyself]."
**38** Then the fire of the Lord fell from Heaven, and consumed the burnt offerings, and the wood, and the stones,
