1 ΒΡΟΤΟΣ γὰρ γεννητὸς γυναικὸς ὀλιγόβιος, καὶ πλήρης ὀργῆς·
2 ἢ ὥσπερ ἄνθος ἀνθῆσαν ἐξέπεσεν· ἀπέδρα δὲ ὥσπερ σκιά,
3 καὶ οὐ μὴ στῇ. Οὐχὶ καὶ τούτου λόγον ἐποίησω; καὶ τοῦτον
4 ἐποίησας ἐν κρίματι εἰσελθεῖν ἐπὶ σοῦ; Τίς γὰρ ἔσται καθαρὸς
5 ἀπὸ ῥύπου; οὐδὲ εἷς, ἐὰν καὶ μιᾶς ἡμέρας γένηται ὁ βίος αὐτοῦ
6 ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς. Ἀριθμητοὶ δὲ μῆνες αὐτοῦ παρὰ σοί· (εἰς) χρόνον
7 (γάρ) ἔθου, καὶ οὐ μὴ ὑπερβῇ. Ἀπόσα ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ, ἵνα ἡσυχάσῃ,
8 καὶ εὐδοκήσῃ αὐτοῦ τὸν βίον ὥσπερ μισθωτός. Ἔστι γὰρ δένδρῳ
9 ἐλπίς· ἐὰν δὲ (καὶ) ἐκκοπῇ, πάλιν ἀνθήσει, καὶ ὁ βλάδαμος αὐτοῦ
10 οὐ μὴ ἐκλείπῃ· ἐὰν γὰρ γηράσῃ ἐν γῇ ἡ ῥίζα αὐτοῦ, ἐν δὲ πέτρᾳ
11 τελευτήσῃ τὸ στέλεχος αὐτοῦ, ἀπὸ ὀσμῆς ὕδατος ἀνθήσει, καὶ
12 ποιήσει θερισμὸν ὥσπερ νεόφυτον· ἀνὴρ δὲ τελευτήσας ᾤχετο, καὶ
13 πεσὼν βροτὸς οὐκέτι ἐστί. Χρόνῳ γὰρ σπανίζεται θάλασσα, πο-
14 ταμὸς δὲ ἐρημωθεὶς ξηρανθήσεται. Ἄνθρωπος δὲ κοιμηθεὶς οὐ μὴ
15 ἀναστῇ, καὶ οὐ μὴ συῤῥαφῇ, ἕως ἂν ὁ οὐρανὸς παλαιωθῇ, καὶ οὐκ
16 ἐξυπνισθήσονται ἐξ ὕπνου αὐτῶν. Εἰ γὰρ ὤφελον ἐν ἅδῃ με φυλά-
17 ξεις, κρύψεις δέ με ἕως ἂν παύσηταί σου ἡ ὀργή, καὶ τάξῃ μοι
18 χρόνον ἐν ᾧ μνείαν μου ποιήσῃ. Ἐὰν γὰρ ἀποθάνῃ ἄνθρωπος, μήτι
19 ζήσεται, συντελέσας ἡμέρας τοῦ βίου αὐτοῦ; ὑπομενῶ (σε) ἕως ἂν
20 πάλιν γένωμαι· εἶτα καλέσεις (με), ἐγὼ δέ σοι ὑπακούσομαι· τὰ
21 δὲ ἔργα τῶν χειρῶν σου μὴ ἀποποιοῦ. Ἠρίθμησας δέ μου τὰ
22 ἐπιτηδεύματα, καὶ οὐ μὴ παρέλθῃ σε οὐδὲν τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν μου·
23 ἐσφράγισας δέ μου τὰ ἁμαρτήματα ἐν βαλαντίῳ, καὶ ἐπεσημά-
24 νω εἴ τι ἄκων παρέβην. Καὶ πλὴν ὄρος πίπτον πεσεῖται, καὶ πέ-
25 τρα παλαιωθήσεται ἐκ τοῦ τόπου αὐτῆς· λίθους ἐλέανεν ὕδατα,
26 καὶ κατέκλυσεν ὕδατα ὕπτια τοῦ χώματος τῆς γῆς· καὶ ὑπομονὴν
27 ἀνθρώπου ἀπώλεσας, ὥσας αὐτὸν εἰς τέλος, καὶ ᾤχετο· (καὶ)
28 μετέστησας αὐτοῦ τὸ πρόσωπόν (σου), καὶ ἐξαπέστειλας αὐτόν.
29 Πολλῶν δὲ γενομένων τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ, οὐκ οἶδεν· ἐάν τε ὀλίγοι
30 γένωνται, οὐκ ἐπίσαιται. Ἀλλ’ ἢ αἱ σάρκες αὐτοῦ ἐπ’ αὐτῷ ἤλγη-
31 σαν· ἡ δὲ ψυχὴ αὐτοῦ ἐπ’ αὐτῷ ἐπένθησεν.

## CHAPTER XIV.

**1** For mortal man, born of woman, is of few days, and full of wrath;
**2** Or as a blossom, having bloomed, he doth fall away; and fleeth as a shadow,
**3** And shall not stand. Wilt Thou not also take account of such a one as this? And Him
**4** Hast Thou made to enter into judgment with Thee? For who shall be clean
**5** From pollution? No, not one, though his life be but of one day
**6** Upon the earth. But his months are numbered with Thee; for to [a fixed] time
**7** [Indeed,] Thou hast set [his bounds], and he shall not transgress [them]. Turn away from him, that he may be quiet,
**8** And may have pleasure in his life, as a hired servant [doth his day]. For there is to a tree
**9** Hope; for if it be cut down, it will blossom again, and its branch
**10** Shall not fail; for if its root wax old in the earth, and its stock die in the rock,
**11** Yet from the scent of water it will bud, and
**12** Shall bring forth a harvest as a newly-planted shoot. But man, having died, is departed, and
**13** Man, when he is fallen, is no more. For by time is the sea diminished, and a river,
**14** Being made desolate, shall be dried up. But man, having fallen asleep, shall not
**15** Arise again, neither shall he be stitched together, until the heaven be waxen old, and they shall not
**16** Be awakened out of their sleep. Oh that Thou wouldst hide me in Hades,
**17** And conceal me until Thy wrath be turned away, and Thou appoint me
**18** A time wherein Thou wilt remember me. For if a man die, shall he surely not
**19** Live [again], having finished the days of his life? I will wait [for Thee] until
**20** I become again [alive]; then shalt Thou call (me), and I will answer Thee; and the
**21** Works of Thy hands do Thou not reject. Thou hast numbered, moreover, my
**22** Doings, and nothing of my sins shall escape Thee;
**23** Yea, Thou hast sealed up my sins in a bag, and hast marked
**24** If I have transgressed aught unwillingly. But verily, a falling mountain shall fall, and a rock
**25** Shall be worn away from its place. Waters have worn smooth the stones,
**26** And waters supine have overwhelmed the soil of the earth; and Thou hast destroyed the patience
**27** Of man, and hast moved him to the end, and he is gone; (and)
**28** Thou hast removed his countenance from Thy [presence], and sent him away.
**29** But if his sons be many, he knoweth it not; and if they be few,
**30** He shall not perceive it. But only his flesh upon him doth pain,
**31** And his soul within him mourneth.
