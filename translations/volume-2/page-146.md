ΚΕΦ. Ηʹ. Θʹ.
65 δῶρον, καὶ τὰς θυσίας τῶν εἰρηνικῶν ὑπενεγκεῖν. Καὶ ἐποίησε
Σαλωμὼν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ τὴν ἑορτήν, καὶ πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ μετ᾿
αὐτοῦ, ἐκκλησία μεγάλη, ἀπὸ τῆς εἰσόδου Αἰμὰθ ἕως ποταμοῦ
Αἰγύπτου, ἐνώπιον Κυρίου Θεοῦ ἡμῶν ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ ᾧ ᾠκοδόμη-
σεν, ἐσθίων, καὶ πίνων, καὶ εὐφραινόμενος ἐνώπιον Κυρίου Θεοῦ
ἡμῶν ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας, καὶ ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας, τεσσαρεσκαίδεκα ἡμέρας.
66 Καὶ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ὀγδόῃ ἐξαπέστειλε τὸν λαόν· καὶ εὐλόγησαν
τὸν βασιλέα, καὶ ἀπῆλθον ἕκαστος εἰς τὰ σκηνώματα αὐτοῦ χαί-
ροντες· καὶ ἀγαθῇ καρδίᾳ ἐπὶ πᾶσι τοῖς ἀγαθοῖς οἷς ἐποίησε Κύ-
ριος τῷ Δαυὶδ δούλῳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ τῷ Ἰσραὴλ λαῷ αὐτοῦ·

ΚΕΦ. Θ΄. ΙΧ.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐγενήθη ὡς συνετέλεσε Σαλωμὼν οἰκοδομῶν τὸν οἶκον
Κυρίου, καὶ τὸν οἶκον τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν πραγματείαν
2 Σαλωμὼν, ὅσα ἠθέλησε ποιῆσαι. Καὶ ὤφθη Κύριος τῷ Σαλω-
3 μὼν δεύτερον, καθὼς ὤφθη αὐτῷ ἐν Γαβαών. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος
πρὸς αὐτόν. Ἤκουσα τῆς φωνῆς τῆς προσευχῆς σου, καὶ τῆς δε-
ήσεως ἧς ἐδεήθης ἐνώπιον ἐμοῦ· πεποίηκά σοι κατὰ πᾶσαν τὴν
προσευχὴν σου· ἡγίασα τὸν οἶκον τοῦτον ὃν ᾠκοδόμησας τοῦ θέ-
σθαι τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐκεῖ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα· καὶ ἔσονται οἱ ὀφθαλμοί
μου, καὶ ἡ καρδία μου ἔχει πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας.
4 Καὶ σὺ ἐὰν πορευθῇς ἐνώπιόν μου, καθὼς ἐπορεύθη Δαυὶδ ὁ πατήρ σου, ἐν ὁσι-
ότητι καρδίας, ἐν εὐθύτητι, τοῦ ποιεῖν κατὰ πάντα ἃ ἐνετειλάμην
5 αὐτῷ, καὶ τὰ προστάγματά μου, καὶ τὰς ἐντολάς μου φυλάξῃς,
καὶ ἀναστήσω τὸν θρόνον σου ἐπὶ Ἰσραὴλ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, καθὼς
ἐλάλησα Δαυὶδ τῷ πατρί σου, λέγων· Οὐκ ἐξαρθήσεταί σου ἀνὴρ
6 ἡγούμενος ἐν Ἰσραήλ. Ἐὰν δὲ ἀποστραφέντες ἀποστραφῆτε ὑμεῖς,
καὶ τὰ τέκνα ὑμῶν ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ, καὶ μὴ φυλάξητε τὰς ἐντολάς μου,
καὶ τὰ προστάγματά μου ἃ ἔδωκε Μωσῆς, ἐνώπιον ὑμῶν, καὶ
πορευθῆτε, καὶ δουλεύσητε θεοῖς ἑτέροις, καὶ προσκυνήσητε αὐτοῖς,
7 Καὶ ἐξαρῶ τὸν Ἰσραὴλ ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς ἧς ἔδωκα αὐτοῖς, καὶ τὸν
οἶκον τοῦτον ὃν ἡγίασα τῷ ὀνόματί μου ἀποῤῥίψω ἐκ προσώπου
μου· καὶ ἔσται Ἰσραὴλ εἰς ἀφανισμόν, καὶ εἰς λάλημα εἰς πάν-
8 τας τοὺς λαούς. Καὶ ὁ οἶκος οὗτος ἔσται ὑψηλός. πᾶς ὁ διαπορευόμενος δι᾿ αὐτοῦ ἐκστήσεται, καὶ συριεῖ, καὶ ἐροῦσιν· ἕνεκα

**65** ...and the [cereal] offering, and to bear up the sacrifices of the peace offerings. And Solomon held the feast on that day, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the River of Egypt, before the Lord our God, in the house which he had built, eating and drinking and rejoicing before the Lord our God, seven days, and seven days, even fourteen days.

**66** And on the eighth day he sent the people away; and they blessed the king, and departed each man unto his tents, rejoicing and with glad hearts for all the goodness which the Lord had wrought for David His servant, and for Israel His people.

#### CHAPTER 9

**1** And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished building the House of the Lord, and the king's house, and all the enterprise of Solomon,

**2** whatsoever he desired to do,

**3** that the Lord appeared unto Solomon a second time, as He had appeared unto him in Gibeon. And the Lord said unto him: "I have heard the voice of thy prayer, and of the supplication which thou hast made before Me; I have wrought for thee according to all thy prayer. I have hallowed this house which thou hast built, to set My Name there forever; and My eyes, and My heart shall be there continually, for all days.

**4** And if thou wilt walk before Me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I commanded him,

**5** and if thou wilt keep My statutes and My commandments, then will I establish thy throne upon Israel forever, as I spake unto David thy father, saying: 'There shall not fail thee a man to rule in Israel.'

**6** But if ye shall turn away and utterly abandon Me, ye and your children, and shall not keep My commandments and My statutes, which Moses gave before you, and go and serve other gods, and worship them,

**7** then will I cut off Israel from the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for My Name, will I cast out of My sight; and Israel shall become a desolation, and a byword among all peoples.

**8** And this house, once so high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss, and they shall say, 'Wherefore...'
