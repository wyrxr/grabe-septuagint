21 ἀνέστην τοπρωῒ θηλάσαι τὸν υἱόν μου, καὶ ἐκεῖνος ἦν τεθνηκώς. Καὶ
ἰδοὺ κατενόησα αὐτὸν τοπρωῒ, καὶ ἰδοὺ οὐκ ἦν ὁ υἱός μου ὃν ἔτε-
κον. 22 Καὶ εἶπεν ἡ γυνὴ ἡ ἑτέρα· οὐχί, ἀλλ᾽ ὁ υἱός σου ἐστιν
ὁ νεκρός, υἱὸς δὲ ἐμὸς ὁ ζῶν. Ἡ δὲ λαλεῖ, καὶ αὐτὴ ἔλεγεν·
οὐχί, ἀλλ᾽ ὁ υἱός μου ὁ ζῶν, ὁ δὲ υἱός σου ὁ τεθνηκώς· καὶ ἐ-
λάλησαν ἐνώπιον τοῦ βασιλέως. 23 Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς αὐταῖς·
σὺ λέγεις, οὗτος ὁ υἱός μου ὁ ζῶν, καὶ ὁ υἱὸς ταύτης ὁ τεθνη-
κώς· σὺ δὲ λέγεις· οὐχί, ἀλλ᾽ ὁ υἱός σου ὁ τεθνηκώς, καὶ ὁ υἱ-
ός μου ὁ ζῶν. 24 Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεύς, λάβετέ μοι μάχαιραν· καὶ
προσήνεγκαν τὴν μάχαιραν ἐνώπιον τοῦ βασιλέως. 25 Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ
βασιλεύς· διέλετε τὸ παιδίον τὸ θηλάζον τὸ ζῶν εἰς δύο, καὶ δό-
τε τὸ ἥμισυ αὐτοῦ ταύτῃ, καὶ τὸ ἥμισυ αὐτοῦ ταύτῃ. 26 Καὶ ἀ-
πεκρίθη ἡ γυνὴ ἧς ὁ υἱὸς ἦν ὁ ζῶν, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα·
ὅτι ἐταράχθη ἡ μήτρα αὐτῆς ἐπὶ τῷ υἱῷ αὐτῆς, καὶ εἶπεν· ἐν ἐ-
μοὶ κύριε, δότε αὐτῇ τὸ παιδίον τὸ ζῶν, καὶ θανάτῳ μὴ θανα-
τώσητε αὐτό. 27 Καὶ αὕτη εἶπε· μήτε ἐμοί, μήτε αὐτῇ ἔστω, διέλε-
τε αὐτό. Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη ὁ βασιλεύς, καὶ εἶπε· δότε αὐτῇ τὸ παι-
δίον τὸ ζῶν τῇ εἰπούσῃ, δότε αὐτῇ αὐτό, καὶ θανάτῳ μὴ θανα-
τώσητε αὐτό· αὕτη ἡ μήτηρ αὐτοῦ. 28 Καὶ ἤκουσαν πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ
τὸ κρίμα τοῦτ᾽ ὃ ἔκρινεν ὁ βασιλεύς, καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν ἀπὸ προ-
σώπου τοῦ βασιλέως, ὅτι εἶδον ὅτι φρόνησις Θεοῦ ἐν αὐτῷ τοῦ
ποιεῖν δικαίωμα.

ΚΕΦ. Δ΄. IV.

1 ΚΑΙ ἦν ὁ βασιλεὺς Σαλωμὼν βασιλεύων ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ.
2 Καὶ οὗτοι οἱ ἄρχοντες οἱ ἦσαν αὐτῷ· Ἀζαρίας υἱὸς Σαδὼκ, ὁ
ἱερεύς· 3 Ἐλιαρὲφ καὶ Ἀχία υἱὸς Σεισὰ, γραμματεῖς· καὶ Ἰωσα-
φὰτ υἱὸς Ἀχιλουδ, ἀναμνήσκων· 4 καὶ Βαναίας υἱὸς Ἰωαδαὲ ἐπὶ
τῆς στρατείας· καὶ Σαδὼκ καὶ Ἀβιάθας, ἱερεῖς· 5 καὶ Ἀζαρίας
υἱὸς Νάθαν ἐπὶ τῶν καθεσταμένων· καὶ Ζαββοὺδ υἱὸς Νάθαν ἱε-
ρεύς, ἑταῖρος τοῦ βασιλέως· 6 καὶ Ἀχισὰρ ἦν οἰκονόμος, καὶ Ἡ-
λιάκ ὁ οἰκονόμος· καὶ Ἐλιὰβ υἱὸς Σαρὰτ ἐπὶ τῆς πατριᾶς· καὶ
Ἀδωνιρὰμ υἱὸς Ἀβδὼ ἐπὶ τῶν φόρων. 7 Καὶ τῷ Σαλωμὼν δώδεκα
καθεσταμένοι ἐπὶ πάντα Ἰσραήλ, χορηγεῖν τῷ βασιλεῖ καὶ τῷ οἴ-
κῳ αὐτοῦ· μῆνα ἕν ἐν τῷ ἐνιαυτῷ ἐγίνετο ἐπὶ τὸν ἕνα χορηγεῖν.

### A Royal Translation of the Third Book of Kingdoms, Chapter 3

**21** I rose up in the morning to give suck to my son, and lo, he was dead. And behold, I considered him in the morning, and behold, it was not my son, whom I had borne.

**22** And the other woman said, "Nay, but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living." And she spoke, yea, she said, "Nay, but my son is the living, and thy son is the dead." And they spoke before the king.

**23** And the king said unto them, "Thou sayest, 'This is my son that liveth, and this woman's son is the dead'; and thou sayest, 'Nay, but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living.'"

**24** And the king said, "Bring me a sword." And they brought a sword before the king.

**25** And the king said, "Divide the living suckling child into two, and give the half thereof to the one, and the half thereof to the other."

**26** Then the woman whose son was the living answered and said unto the king (for her bowels yearned upon her son), "O my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it!"

**27** And this [other] woman said, "Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it." And the king answered and said, "Give unto her the living child that spake, give it unto her, and in no wise slay it; for she is the mother thereof."

**28** And all Israel heard the judgment which the king had judged, and they feared before the king; for they perceived that the wisdom of God was in him, to execute righteous judgment.
