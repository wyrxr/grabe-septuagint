ΚΑΙ ἐξεκκλησίασεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Σαλωμὼν πάντας τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους Ἰσραήλ, συντάξας κεφαλὰς τῶν ῥάβδων, ἐπηρμένους τῶν πατέρων τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Σαλωμὼν ἐν Σιών, τοῦ ἀνενεγκεῖν τὴν κιβωτὸν διαθήκης Κυρίου ἐκ πόλεως Δαυΐδ· αὕτη ἐστὶ Σιών. Καὶ ἐξεκλησιάσθησαν πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Σαλωμὼν πᾶς ἀνὴρ Ἰσραὴλ ἐν μηνὶ Ἀθανεὶμ ἐν τῇ ἑορτῇ· αὐτὸς ὁ μὴν ἑβδομηκοστὸς ἕβδομος. Καὶ ἦλθον πάντες οἱ πρεσβύτεροι Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἦραν οἱ ἱερεῖς τὴν κιβωτόν. Καὶ ἀνεβίβασαν τὴν κιβωτὸν Κυρίου, καὶ τὸ σκήνωμα τοῦ μαρτυρίου, καὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη τὰ ἅγια, τὰ ἐν τῷ σκηνώματι τοῦ μαρτυρίου· καὶ ἀνεβίβασαν αὐτὰ οἱ ἱερεῖς καὶ οἱ Λευῖται. Καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς Σαλωμών, καὶ πᾶσα συναγωγὴ Ἰσραήλ, οἱ συντεταγμένοι ἐπ’ αὐτόν, σὺν αὐτῷ ἔμπροσθεν τῆς κιβωτοῦ θύοντες πρόβατα, καὶ βόας, ἃ οὐ ψηφισθήσεται, ἀναρίθμητα ἀπὸ πλήθους. Καὶ εἰσφέρουσιν οἱ ἱερεῖς τὴν κιβωτὸν διαθήκης Κυρίου εἰς τὸν τόπον αὐτῆς, εἰς τὸ δαβεὶρ τοῦ οἴκου, εἰς τὰ ἅγια τῶν ἁγίων, ὑπὸ τὰς πτέρυγας τῶν χερουβείμ. Ὅτι τὰ χερουβεὶμ διαπεπετασμένα ταῖς πτέρυξιν ἐπὶ τὸν τόπον τῆς κιβωτοῦ· καὶ περιεκάλυπτον τὰ χερουβεὶμ τὴν κιβωτόν, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ ἅγια αὐτῆς ἐπάνωθεν. Καὶ ὑπερεῖχον τὰ ἡγιασμένα· καὶ ἐνεβλέποντο αἱ κεφαλαὶ τῶν ἡγιασμένων ἐκ τῶν ἁγίων εἰς πρόσωπον τοῦ δαβείρ, καὶ οὐκ ὤπτοντο ἔξω, καὶ ἐγένοντο ἐκεῖ ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης. Οὐκ ἦν ἐν τῇ κιβωτῷ πλὴν δύο πλάκες λίθιναι, πλάκες τῆς διαθήκης, ἃς ἔθηκε Μωσῆς ἔχει ἐν Χωρήβ, ἃς διέθετο Κύριος μετὰ υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τῷ ἐκπορεύεσθαι αὐτοὺς ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἐξῆλθον οἱ ἱερεῖς ἐκ τοῦ ἁγίου, καὶ ἡ νεφέλη ἔπλησε τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου. Καὶ οὐκ ἐδύναντο οἱ ἱερεῖς στῆναι λειτουργεῖν ἀπὸ προσώπου τῆς νεφέλης, ὅτι ἔπλησε δόξα Κυρίου τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου. Τότε εἶπε Σαλωμών· Κύριος εἶπε τοῦ σκηνῶσαι ἐν γνόφῳ. Ὠκοδόμησα οἶκον κατοικητηρίου σοι, ἕδρασμα τῆς καθέδρας σου αἰῶνος. Καὶ ἀπέστρεψεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ, καὶ εὐλόγησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς πάντα Ἰσραήλ· καὶ πᾶσα ἐκκλησία Ἰσραὴλ εἰστήκει. Καὶ εἶπεν· Εὐλογητὸς Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ σήμερον, ὃς ἐλάλησεν ἐν στόματι αὐτοῦ περὶ Δαυΐδ

### A Royal Translation of the Third Book of Kingdoms, Chapter 8

**Chapter 8**

**1** And King Solomon gathered all the elders of Israel, having assembled the heads of the tribes, [even those] raised up from the fathers of the children of Israel, unto King Solomon in Zion, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the city of David; this [city] is Zion.
**2** And all the men of Israel were assembled unto King Solomon, in the month Ethanim, at the feast; this [is] the seventh month.
**3** And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests bore the ark.
**4** And they brought up the ark of the Lord, and the tabernacle of witness, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle of witness; and the priests and the Levites brought them up.
**5** And King Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, who were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, which could not be numbered, [being] innumerable for their multitude.
**6** And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord into its place, into the inner sanctuary of the House, even into the Holy of Holies, under the wings of the cherubim.
**7** For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark; and the cherubim covered the ark, and its sacred [parts] from above.
**8** And the holy [staves] extended beyond; and the heads of the holy [staves] were seen from the Holy Place, before the inner sanctuary, yet they were not seen without; and there they remain unto this day.
**9** There was nothing in the ark, save the two tables of stone, the tables of the covenant, which Moses did place, [and which] it has [from its origin] in Horeb, which the Lord made with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.
**10** And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the House of the Lord.
**11** So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for the glory of the Lord had filled the House of the Lord.
**12** Then spake Solomon: "The Lord said that He would dwell in thick darkness.
**13** I have built a House [as] a habitation for You, a firm place for Your dwelling forever."
**14** And the king turned his face about, and the king blessed all Israel; (and all the congregation of Israel stood).
**15** And he said, "Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, this day, who spoke with His mouth concerning David..."
