Ἀσὰφ ἀπ᾿ ἀρχῆς πρῶτος τῶν ἀδόντων καὶ ὕμνον καὶ αἴνεσιν τῷ
Θεῷ. Καὶ πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ ἐν ἡμέραις Ζοροβάβελ καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέ- 47
ραις Νεεμίου, διδόντες μερίδας τῶν ἀδόντων καὶ τῶν πυλωρῶν,
λόγον ἡμέρας ἐν ἡμέρᾳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἁγιάζοντες τοῖς Λευίταις, καὶ
οἱ Λευῖται ἁγιάζοντες τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἀαρών.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΓ΄. ΧΙΙΙ.

ΕΝ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἀνεγνώσθη ἐν βιβλίῳ Μωσῆ ἐν ὠσὶ 1
τοῦ λαοῦ. καὶ εὑρέθη γεγραμμένον ἐν αὐτῷ, ὅπως μὴ εἰσέλθωσιν
Ἀμμανῖται καὶ Μωαβῖται ἐν ἐκκλησίᾳ Θεοῦ ἕως αἰῶνος, ὅτι οὐ 2
συνήντησαν τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραὴλ ἐν ἄρτῳ καὶ ἐν ὕδατι, καὶ ἐμισθώ-
σαντο ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν τὸν Βαλαὰμ καταράσασθαι· καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν ὁ Θεὸς
ἡμῶν τὴν κατάραν εἰς εὐλογίαν. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἤκουσαν τὸν νό- 3
μον, καὶ ἐχωρίσθησαν πᾶς ἐπίμικτος ἐν Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ πρὸ τούτου 4
Ἐλιασεὶβ ὁ ἱερεὺς οἰκῶν ἐν γαζοφυλακίῳ οἴκου τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν
ἐγγίων Τωβίᾳ· καὶ ἐποίησεν αὐτῷ γαζοφυλάκιον μέγα· καὶ ἐκεῖ 5
ἦσαν πρότερον διδόντες τὴν Μαναάν, καὶ τὸν λίβανον, καὶ τὰ
σκευή, καὶ τὴν δεκάτην τοῦ σίτου καὶ τοῦ οἴνου καὶ τοῦ ἐλαίου,
ἐντολὴν τῶν Λευιτῶν καὶ τῶν ἀδόντων καὶ τῶν πυλωρῶν, καὶ
ἀπαρχὰς τῶν ἱερέων. Καὶ ἐν παντὶ τούτῳ οὐκ ἤμην ἐν Ἱερου- 6
σαλήμ, ὅτι ἐν ἔτει τριακοστῷ καὶ δευτέρῳ τοῦ Ἀρθασασθὰ βασι-
λέως Βαβυλῶνος ἦλθον πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα, καὶ μετὰ τὸ τέλος τῶν
ἡμερῶν ᾐτησάμην παρὰ τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ ἦλθον εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ, 7
καὶ συνῆκα ἐν τῇ πονηρίᾳ ᾗ ἐποίησεν Ἐλιασεὶβ τῷ Τωβίᾳ, ποιῆ-
σαι αὐτῷ γαζοφυλάκιον ἐν αὐλῇ οἴκου τοῦ Θεοῦ. Καὶ πονηρόν 8
μοι ἐφάνη σφόδρα· καὶ ἐξέβριψα πάντα τὰ σκεύη οἴκου Τωβία ἔξω
ἀπὸ τοῦ γαζοφυλακίου. Καὶ εἶπα, καὶ ἐκαθάρισαν τὰ γαζοφυλά- 9
κια· καὶ ἐπέστρεψα ἐκεῖ σκεύη οἴκου τοῦ Θεοῦ, τὴν Μαναὰν καὶ
τὸν λίβανον. Καὶ ἔγνων ὅτι μερίδες τῶν Λευιτῶν οὐκ ἐδόθησαν. 10
καὶ ἐφύγοσαν ἀνὴρ εἰς ἀγρὸν αὐτοῦ, οἱ Λευῖται καὶ οἱ ἄδοντες,
ποιοῦντες τὸ ἔργον. Καὶ ἐμαχεσάμην τοῖς στρατηγοῖς, καὶ εἶπον· 11
διὰ τί ἐγκατελείφθη ὁ οἶκος τοῦ Θεοῦ; καὶ συνήγαγον αὐτούς,
καὶ ἔστησα αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ στάσει αὐτῶν. Καὶ πᾶς Ἰούδα ἤνεγκαν 12
δεκάτην τοῦ πυροῦ καὶ τοῦ οἴνου καὶ τοῦ ἐλαίου εἰς τοὺς θησαυ-
ροὺς ἐπὶ χεῖρα Σελεμία τοῦ ἱερέως, καὶ Σαδὼκ τοῦ γραμματέως, 13

#### NEHEMIAH CHAPTER XII

<sup>46</sup> Asaph, from the beginning, was the chief of the singers, and [he established] hymn and praise unto God.
<sup>47</sup> And all Israel, in the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah, did give portions unto the singers and the gatekeepers, a daily portion on its appointed day; and they consecrated [offerings] for the Levites, and the Levites in turn consecrated [portions] for the sons of Aaron.

#### NEHEMIAH CHAPTER XIII

<sup>1</sup> On that selfsame day was read from the book of Moses, in the hearing of the people; and it was found written therein, that the Ammonites and the Moabites should not enter into the assembly of God for ever;
<sup>2</sup> for they had not met the children of Israel with bread and with water, and had hired against them Balaam to curse them; but our God turned the curse into a blessing.
<sup>3</sup> And it came to pass, when they heard the law, that all the mixed multitude in Israel separated themselves.
<sup>4</sup> But before this, Eliashib the priest, dwelling in the treasury chamber of the House of our God, being allied to Tobiah,
<sup>5</sup> had prepared for him a great chamber. And there, aforetime, were they giving the Manna, and the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithe of the grain, and of the wine, and of the oil – [which was] the enjoined portion of the Levites, and of the singers, and of the gatekeepers – and the firstfruits of the priests.
<sup>6</sup> Now in all this time, I was not in Jerusalem; for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes, the king of Babylon, I had come unto the king. And after the completion of certain days, I sought leave of the king, and came unto Jerusalem.
<sup>7</sup> And I then understood the evil which Eliashib had wrought for Tobiah, in preparing for him a chamber in the court of the House of God.
<sup>8</sup> And it seemed evil unto me exceeding greatly; wherefore I cast forth all the household vessels of Tobiah out of the chamber.
<sup>9</sup> And I gave order, and they purified the chambers; and I restored thither the vessels of the House of God, the Manna and the frankincense.
<sup>10</sup> And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given [unto them]; so that every man of the Levites and the singers, who did the work, had fled to his own field.
<sup>11</sup> Then contended I with the rulers, and said, "Wherefore is the House of God forsaken?" And I gathered them together, and set them in their proper station.
<sup>12</sup> And all Judah brought the tithe of the grain and of the wine and of the oil into the treasuries, into the hand of Shelemiah the priest, and of Zadok the scribe,
<sup>13</sup> and of Pedaiah, one of the Levites.
