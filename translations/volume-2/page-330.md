²⁰ τησε τοὺς θεοὺς τῶν Ἰδουμαίων. ²¹ Καὶ ἀνέβη Ἰωὰς βασιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ ὤφθησαν ἀλλήλοις, αὐτὸς καὶ Ἀμασίας βασιλεὺς Ἰούδα ²² ἐν Βαιθσαμὺς, ἥ ἐστι τοῦ Ἰούδα. Καὶ ἐτροπώθη Ἰούδας κατὰ πρόσωπον Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ ἔφυγον ἕκαστος εἰς τὸ σκήνωμα αὐτοῦ. ²³ Καὶ τὸν Ἀμασίαν βασιλέα Ἰούδα τὸν τοῦ Ἰωὰς υἱοῦ Ἰωάχαζ **κατέλαβεν** Ἰωὰς βασιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ ἐν Βαιθσαμὺς, καὶ εἰσήγαγεν αὐτὸν εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ, καὶ κατέσπασεν ἀπὸ τοῦ τείχους Ἱερουσαλὴμ, ἀπὸ πύλης Ἐφραὶμ ἕως πύλης γωνίας, τετρακοσίους πήχεις. ²⁴ Καὶ πᾶν τὸ χρυσίον, καὶ τὸ ἀργύριον, καὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη τὰ εὑρεθέντα ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου, καὶ παρὰ τῷ Ἀβδεδδὸμ, καὶ τοὺς θησαυροὺς οἴκου τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς τῶν συμμίξεων, καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν εἰς Σαμάρειαν. ²⁵ Καὶ ἔζησεν Ἀμασίας ὁ τοῦ Ἰωὰς βασιλεὺς Ἰούδα μετὰ τὸ ἀποθανεῖν Ἰωὰς τὸν τοῦ Ἰωάχαζ βασιλέα Ἰσραὴλ ἔτη δεκαπέντε. ²⁶ Καὶ οἱ λοιποὶ λόγοι Ἀμασίου, οἱ πρῶτοι καὶ οἱ ἔσχατοι, οὐκ ἰδοὺ γεγραμμένοι ἐπὶ βιβλίου βασιλέων Ἰούδα καὶ Ἰσραήλ; ²⁷ Καὶ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ᾧ ἀπέστη Ἀμασίας ἀπὸ Κυρίου, καὶ ἐπέθεντο αὐτῷ ἐπίθεσιν, καὶ ἔφυγεν ἀπὸ Ἱερουσαλὴμ εἰς Λαχεῖς, καὶ ἀπέστειλαν κατόπισθεν αὐτοῦ εἰς Λαχεῖς, καὶ ἐθανάτωσαν αὐτὸν ἐκεῖ. ²⁸ Καὶ ἀνέλαβον αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τῶν ἵππων, καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ ἐν πόλει Δαυίδ.

#### CHAPTER XXVI.

¹ ΚΑΙ ἔλαβε πᾶς ὁ λαὸς τῆς γῆς τὸν Ὀζίαν, καὶ αὐτὸς υἱὸς δέκα καὶ ἕξ ἐτῶν, καὶ ἐβασίλευσαν αὐτὸν ἀντὶ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ Ἀμασίου. ² Αὐτὸς ᾠκοδόμησε τὴν Αἰλὰθ, αὐτὸς ἐπέστρεψεν αὐτὴν τῷ Ἰούδα μετὰ τὸ κοιμηθῆναι τὸν βασιλέα μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ. ³ Υἱὸς δεκαὲξ ἐτῶν ἐβασίλευσεν Ὀζίας, καὶ πεντήκοντα καὶ δύο ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ, καὶ ὄνομα τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ Ἰεχελία ἀπὸ Ἱερουσαλήμ. ⁴ Καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ εὐθὲς ἐνώπιον Κυρίου, κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν Ἀμασίας ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ. ⁵ Καὶ ἦν ἐκζητῶν τὸν Κύριον ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις Ζαχαρίου τοῦ συνίοντος ἐν φόβῳ Κυρίου, καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις αὐτοῦ ἐζήτησε τὸν Κύριον, καὶ εὐώδωσεν αὐτῷ Κύριος. ⁶ Καὶ ἐξῆλθε καὶ ἐπολέμησε πρὸς τοὺς ἀλλοφύλους, καὶ κατέσπασε τὰ τείχη Γεθ, καὶ τὰ τείχη Ἰαβνήρ, καὶ τὰ τείχη Ἀζώτου, καὶ ᾠκοδόμησε πόλεις Ἀζώτου, καὶ ἐν [τοῖς ἀλλοφύλοις].

#### CHAPTER XXV. [CONTINUED]

²⁰ ...he had sought after the gods of the Edomites.

²¹ Then Joash king of Israel went up, and they looked one another in the face, even he and Amaziah king of Judah, ²² in Beth-shemesh, which belongeth to Judah. And Judah was put to the rout before Israel, and every man fled to his own tent.

²³ And Joash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, [even] him who was the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, in Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem; and he broke down from the wall of Jerusalem, from the Gate of Ephraim even unto the Corner Gate, four hundred cubits.

²⁴ And all the gold, and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of the Lord, and with Obed-edom, and the treasures of the king's house, and the sons of the hostages, he returned unto Samaria.

²⁵ And Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel.

²⁶ Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, the first and the last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?

²⁷ And in the time when Amaziah turned away from the Lord, they conspired a conspiracy against him, and he fled from Jerusalem to Lachish; and they sent after him to Lachish, and there they slew him.

²⁸ And they brought him back upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the City of David.

#### CHAPTER XXVI.

¹ And all the people of the land took Uzziah, who was a son of sixteen years, and they made him king in the room of his father Amaziah.

² He it was that built Elath, and he restored it to Judah after the king had fallen asleep with his fathers.

³ Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign, and fifty and two years reigned he in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem.

⁴ And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that Amaziah his father had done.

⁵ And he continued to seek the Lord in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the fear of the Lord; and in his days he sought the Lord, and the Lord prospered him.

⁶ And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and broke down the walls of Gath, and the walls of Jabneh, and the walls of Ashdod, and built cities in Ashdod, and among [the Philistines].
