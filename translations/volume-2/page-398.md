15 τες Περσῶν καὶ Μήδων, οἱ ἐγγὺς τοῦ βασιλέως, οἱ πρῶτοι παρακαθήμενοι τῷ βασιλεῖ, καὶ ἀπήγγειλαν αὐτῷ κατὰ τοὺς νόμους, ὡς δεῖ ποιῆσαι Ἄστιν τῇ βασιλίσσῃ, ὅτι οὐκ ἐποίησε τὰ ὑπὸ τοῦ
16 βασιλέως προσαχθέντα διὰ τῶν εὐνούχων. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ Μουχαῖος πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα καὶ τοὺς ἄρχοντας· οὐ τὸν βασιλέα μόνον ἠτίμασεν Ἄστιν ἡ βασίλισσα, ἀλλὰ καὶ πάντας τοὺς ἄρχοντας, καὶ
17 τοὺς ἡγουμένους τοῦ βασιλέως. Καὶ γὰρ διηγήσατο αὐτοῖς τὰ ῥήματα τῆς βασιλίσσης, καὶ ὡς ἀντεῖπε τῷ βασιλεῖ· ὡς οὖν ἀντεῖπε
18 τῷ βασιλεῖ Ἀρταξέρξη, οὕτω σήμερον αἱ τυραννίδες αἱ λοιπαὶ αἱ τῶν ἀρχόντων Περσῶν καὶ Μήδων ἀκούσασαι τὰ τῷ βασιλεῖ λεχθέντα ὑπ᾿ αὐτῆς, τολμήσουσιν ὁμοίως ἀτιμάσαι τοὺς ἄνδρας αὑτῶν.
19 Εἰ οὖν δοκεῖ τῷ βασιλεῖ προσταξάτω βασιλικόν, καὶ γραφήτω κατὰ τοὺς νόμους Μήδων καὶ Περσῶν, καὶ μὴ ἄλλως χρησάσθω, μηδὲ εἰσελθέτω ἔτι ἡ βασίλισσα πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Ἀρταξέρξην, καὶ τὴν βασιλείαν αὐτῆς ὁ βασιλεὺς δότω γυναικὶ κρείττονι αὐτῆς.
20 Καὶ ἀκουσθήτω ὁ λόγος τοῦ βασιλέως, ὃν ἂν ποιήσῃ ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ ἑαυτοῦ, ἔτι ἀληθής· καὶ οὕτως πᾶσαι αἱ γυναῖκες περιθήσουσιν τιμὴν τοῖς ἀνδράσιν ἑαυτῶν, ἀπὸ πτωχοῦ ἕως πλουσίου.
21 Καὶ ἤρεσεν ὁ λόγος τῷ βασιλεῖ καὶ τοῖς ἄρχουσι· καὶ ἐποίησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς καθὰ ἐλάλησεν ὁ Μουχαῖος,
22 καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐν πάσῃ τῇ βασιλείᾳ εἰς χώραν καὶ χώραν, κατὰ τὴν λέξιν αὐτῶν, ὥστε εἶναι αὐτοῖς φόβον ἐν ταῖς οἰκίαις αὐτῶν.

1 ΚΑΙ μετὰ τοὺς λόγους τούτους ἐκόπασεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τοῦ θυμοῦ, ἐμνήσθη γὰρ τῆς Ἄστιν καθὰ ἐποίησε, καὶ ὅσα αὐτῇ κατεκρίθη.
2 Καὶ εἶπαν οἱ διάκονοι τοῦ βασιλέως· ζητηθήτω τῷ βασιλεῖ κοράσια ἄφθορα καλὰ τῷ εἴδει.
3 Καὶ καταστήσει ὁ βασιλεὺς κωμάρχας ἐν πάσαις ταῖς χώραις τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐπιλεξάτωσαν κοράσια παρθενικὰ καλὰ τῷ εἴδει εἰς Σοῦσαν τὴν πόλιν εἰς τὸν γυναικῶνα, καὶ παραδοθήτωσαν τῷ εὐνούχῳ τοῦ βασιλέως τῷ φύλακι τῶν γυναικῶν· καὶ δοθήτω σμήγμα, καὶ ἡ λοιπὴ ἐπιμέλεια.
4 Καὶ ἡ γυνὴ ἡ ἂν ἀρέσῃ τῷ βασιλεῖ, βασιλεύσει ἀντὶ Ἄστιν.
5 Καὶ ἤρεσε τῷ βασιλεῖ τὸ πρᾶγμα, καὶ ἐποίησεν οὕτως. Καὶ ἄνθρωπος Ἰουδαῖος ἦν ἐν Σούσοις τῇ πόλει, καὶ ὄνομα αὐτῷ Μαρδοχαῖος ὁ

#### THE BOOK OF ESTHER
#### CHAPTER I

<sup>15</sup> of the Persians and Medes, who were nigh unto the king, the chief who sat with the king; and they declared unto him, according to the laws, what ought to be done unto Queen Astin, forasmuch as she did not perform the things brought forth by the king through the eunuchs.
<sup>16</sup> And Mouchaios said unto the king and unto the princes, "Not the king only hath Queen Astin dishonored, but also all the princes and the chiefs of the king.
<sup>17</sup> For he did recount unto them the words of the queen, and how she gainsaid the king. As therefore she gainsaid King Artaxerxes,
<sup>18</sup> so today shall the other noblewomen of the rulers of the Persians and Medes, having heard what was said unto the king by her, likewise dare to dishonor their own husbands.
<sup>19</sup> If it therefore please the king, let a royal decree be issued, and let it be written according to the laws of the Medes and Persians, and let it not be otherwise made use of; nor let the queen any more come in unto King Artaxerxes, and let the king give her kingdom unto a woman better than she.
<sup>20</sup> And let the word of the king, which he shall make in his kingdom, be heard and hold yet true; and so shall all the women render honor unto their own husbands, from the poor unto the rich."
<sup>21</sup> And the word pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according as Mouchaios had spoken,
<sup>22</sup> and the king sent [letters] throughout all the kingdom, unto every province, according to their own tongue, so that awe should be in their households for them [the husbands].

#### CHAPTER II

<sup>1</sup> And after these words, the king's wrath was assuaged; for he remembered Astin, and what she had done, and what had been decreed concerning her.
<sup>2</sup> Then said the king's servants, "Let there be sought for the king young virgins, unblemished and fair of countenance.
<sup>3</sup> And let the king appoint governors over the provinces in all the lands of his kingdom; and let them choose fair young virgins, beautiful of countenance, [and bring them] unto Susa the city, into the women's quarters; and let them be delivered unto the king's eunuch, the keeper of the women. And let ointments be given them, and the rest of the [requisite] care.
<sup>4</sup> And the woman who shall please the king, she shall reign in the stead of Astin."
<sup>5</sup> And the matter pleased the king; and he did so. Now there was a certain Jewish man in Susa the city, and his name was Mardochaios, the [son] of
