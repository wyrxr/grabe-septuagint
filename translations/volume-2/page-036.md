ΚΕΦ. ΙϚ΄.

11 Ἰεσσαί· ἐκλελοίπασι τὰ παιδάρια; καὶ εἶπεν· ἔτι ὁ μικρός, ἰδοὺ
    ποιμαίνει ἐν τῷ ποιμνίῳ. Καὶ εἶπε Σαμουὴλ πρὸς Ἰεσσαί· ἀπό-
    στειλον καὶ λάβε αὐτόν, ὅτι οὐ μὴ κατακλιθῶμεν ἕως τοῦ ἐλ-
12 θόντ᾽ αὐτὸν ἐνταῦθα. Καὶ ἀπέστειλε καὶ εἰσήγαγεν αὐτόν. Καὶ
    οὗτος πυῤῥάκης μετὰ κάλλους ὀφθαλμῶν, καὶ ἀγαθὸς ὁράσει Κυ-
    ρίῳ. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Σαμουήλ· ἀνάστα, χρῖσον τὸν Δαυ-
13 ὶδ, ὅτι οὗτός ἐστιν ἀγαθός. Καὶ ἔλαβε Σαμουὴλ τὸ κέρας τοῦ ἐ-
    λαίου, καὶ ἔχρισεν αὐτὸν ἐν μέσῳ τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐ-
    φήλατο πνεῦμα Κυρίου ἐπὶ Δαυὶδ ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέρας ἐκείνης, καὶ
    ἐπάνω. Καὶ ἀνέστη Σαμουήλ, καὶ ἀπῆλθεν εἰς Ἀραμαθαίμ.
14 Καὶ πνεῦμα Κυρίου ἀπέστη ἀπὸ Σαούλ, καὶ ἔπνιγεν αὐτὸν πνεῦμα
15 πονηρὸν παρὰ Κυρίου. Καὶ εἶπαν οἱ παῖδες Σαούλ πρὸς αὐτόν·
16 ἰδοὺ δὴ πνεῦμα Κυρίου πονηρὸν πνίγει σε, εἰπάτωσαν δὴ οἱ δοῦ-
    λοί σου ἐνώπιόν σου, καὶ ζητησάτωσαν τῷ Κυρίῳ ἡμῶν ἄνδρα
    εἰδότα ψάλλειν ἐν κινύρᾳ. Καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῷ εἶναι ἐν σοὶ πνεῦμα
    πονηρὸν, καὶ ψαλῇ ἐν τῇ κινύρᾳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀγαθόν σοι ἔσται καὶ
    ἀναπαύσει σε.
17 Καὶ εἶπε Σαούλ πρὸς τοὺς παῖδας αὐτοῦ· ἴδετε δὴ μοι ἄνδρα
    ὀρθῶς ψάλλοντα, καὶ εἰσαγάγετε αὐτὸν πρὸς μέ.
18 Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη εἷς τῶν παιδαρίων αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπεν· ἰδοὺ ἑώρακα υἱὸν
    τῷ Ἰεσσαὶ Βηθλεεμίτην, καὶ αὐτὸν εἰδότα ψάλλειν, καὶ ὁ ἀνὴρ
    συνετὸς, καὶ ὁ ἀνὴρ πολεμιστὴς, καὶ σοφὸς λόγῳ, καὶ ἀνὴρ ἀγα-
    θὸς τῷ εἴδει, καὶ Κύριος μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ.
19 Καὶ ἀπέστειλε Σαοὺλ ἀγ-
    γέλους πρὸς Ἰεσσαί, λέγων· ἀπόστειλον πρὸς με Δαυὶδ τὸν υἱόν
    σου τὸν ἐν τῷ ποιμνίῳ σου.
20 Καὶ ἔλαβεν Ἰεσσαὶ γόμορ ἄρτων, καὶ
    ἀσκὸν οἴνου, καὶ ἔριφον ἐξ αἰγῶν ἕνα, καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν ἐν χειρὶ
    Δαυὶδ πρὸς Σαούλ·
21 καὶ παρειστήκει ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἠγάπησεν
    αὐτὸν σφόδρα· καὶ ἐγενήθη αὐτῷ αἴρων σκεύη αὐτοῦ.
22 Καὶ ἀπέ-
    στειλε Σαούλ πρὸς Ἰεσσαί, λέγων· παριστάσθω δὴ Δαυὶδ ἐνώπιον
    ἐμοῦ, ὅτι εὗρε χάριν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς μου.
23 Καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐν τῷ εἶναι
    πνεῦμα πονηρὸν ἐπὶ Σαούλ, καὶ ἐλάμβανε Δαυὶδ τὴν κινύραν, καὶ
    ἔψαλλεν ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀνέψυχε Σαούλ, καὶ ἀγαθὸν αὐτῷ,
    καὶ ἀρίστατο ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ τὸ πνεῦμα τὸ πονηρόν.

**1 Samuel 16**

11 Jesse, 'Are the youths lacking?' And he said, 'There remaineth yet the youngest; behold, he doth tend the flock.' And Samuel said unto Jesse, 'Send and fetch him, for we shall not sit down until he come hither.'
12 And he sent and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, with beautiful eyes, and goodly to look upon unto the LORD.
13 And the LORD said unto Samuel, 'Arise, anoint David, for he is good.' And Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren. And the Spirit of the LORD leaped upon David from that day, and upward. And Samuel rose up, and went away unto Ramah.
14 And the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD choked him.
15 And the servants of Saul said unto him,
16 'Behold now, an evil spirit from the LORD doth choke thee. Let thy servants speak before thee, and let them seek for our lord a man knowing how to play upon the lyre. And it shall be, when the evil spirit is upon thee, and it be played upon his lyre, that it shall be good for thee and shall refresh thee.'
17 And Saul said unto his servants, 'Provide me now a man who can play skillfully, and bring him unto me.'
18 And one of his youths answered and said, 'Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse, a Bethlehemite, and he knoweth how to play, and the man is prudent, and the man is a warrior, and wise in speech, and a man good in appearance, and the LORD is with him.'
19 And Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, saying, 'Send unto me David thy son, him that is with thy flock.'
20 And Jesse took a homer of loaves, and a skin of wine, and one kid of the goats, and sent them by the hand of David unto Saul.
21 And he stood before him, and he loved him exceedingly; and he became his armourbearer.
22 And Saul sent unto Jesse, saying, 'Let David, I pray thee, stand before me, for he hath found favour in my sight.'
23 And it came to pass, when the evil spirit was upon Saul, that David took the lyre, and played with his hand, and Saul was refreshed, and it was good unto him, and the evil spirit departed from him.
