ΚΕΦ. ΙΑ΄. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Δ΄. 683
τοῦ βασιλέως ἐν τῷ ἐκπορεύεσθαι αὐτόν, καὶ ἐν τῷ εἰσπορεύε-
σθαι αὐτόν· καὶ ἐποίησαν οἱ ἑκατόνταρχοι πάντα ὅσα ἐνετεί- 9
λατο Ἰωδαὲ ὁ συνετός. Καὶ ἔλαβεν ἀνὴρ τοὺς ἄνδρας αὐτοῦ,
καὶ τοὺς εἰσπορευομένους τὸ σάββατον μετὰ τῶν ἐκπορευομέ-
νων τὸ σάββατον, καὶ ἐπῆλθον πρὸς Ἰωδαὲ τὸν ἱερέα. Καὶ 10
ἔδωκεν ὁ ἱερεὺς τοῖς ἑκατοντάρχοις τοὺς σειρομάστας, καὶ τοὺς
τρισσοὺς τοῦ βασιλέως Δαυΐδ τοὺς ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου. Καὶ ἔστη- 11
σαν οἱ παρατρέχοντες ἀνήρ, καὶ τὸ σκεῦος αὐτοῦ ἐν χειρὶ αὐ-
τοῦ ἀπὸ τῆς ὠμίας τοῦ οἴκου τῆς δεξιᾶς ἕως τῆς ὠμίας τοῦ οἴ-
κου τῆς εὐωνύμου τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου, καὶ τοῦ οἴκου ἐπὶ τὸν βα-
σιλέα κύκλῳ. Καὶ ἐξαπέστειλε τὸν υἱὸν τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ ἔδω- 12
κεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν τὸ Νεζέρ, καὶ τὸ μαρτύριον, καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν αὐτόν, καὶ
ἔχρισεν αὐτόν. Καὶ ἐκρότησαν τῇ χειρί, καὶ εἶπαν· Ζήτω ὁ βασι-
λεύς. Καὶ ἤκουσε Γοθολία τὴν φωνὴν τῶν τρεχόντων τοῦ λαοῦ, 13
καὶ εἰσῆλθε πρὸς τὸν λαὸν εἰς οἶκον Κυρίου, καὶ εἶδε, καὶ ἰδοὺ 14
ὁ βασιλεὺς εἰστήκει ἐπὶ τοῦ στύλου κατὰ τὸ κρίμα· καὶ οἱ ᾠδοί,
καὶ αἱ σάλπιγγες πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα, καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς τῆς γῆς χαί-
ρων, καὶ σαλπίζων ἐν σάλπιγγι. Καὶ διέρρηξε Γοθολία τὰ ἱμάτια
ἑαυτῆς, καὶ ἐβόησε, σύνδεσμος, σύνδεσμος. Καὶ ἐνετείλατο Ἰωδαὲ 15
ὁ ἱερεὺς τοῖς ἑκατοντάρχοις τοῖς ἐπισκόποις τῆς δυνάμεως, καὶ
εἶπε πρὸς αὐτούς· ἐξαγάγετε αὐτὴν ἔξωθεν τῶν Σαδηρῶθ, καὶ ὁ
εἰσπορευόμενος ὀπίσω αὐτῆς θανατωθήσεται ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ· ὅτι εἶπεν
ὁ ἱερεύς, καὶ μὴ ἀποθάνῃ ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου. Καὶ ἐπέθηκαν αὐ- 16
τῇ χεῖρας, καὶ εἰσῆλθαν ὁδὸν εἰσόδου τῶν ἵππων οἴκου τοῦ βασι-
λέως, καὶ ἀπέθανεν ἐκεῖ. Καὶ διέθετο Ἰωδαὲ διαθήκην ἀναμέσον 17
Κυρίου, καὶ ἀναμέσον τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ ἀναμέσον τοῦ λαοῦ, τοῦ
εἶναι εἰς λαὸν τῷ Κυρίῳ· καὶ ἀναμέσον τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ ἀνα-
μέσον τοῦ λαοῦ. Καὶ εἰσῆλθε πᾶς ὁ λαὸς τῆς γῆς εἰς οἶκον τοῦ 18
Βάαλ, καὶ κατέσπασαν αὐτόν, καὶ τὰ θυσιαστήρια αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰς
εἰκόνας αὐτοῦ συνέτριψαν ἀγαθῶς· καὶ τὸν Μαχὰν τὸν ἱερέα τοῦ
Βάαλ ἀπέκτειναν κατὰ πρόσωπον τῶν θυσιαστηρίων. καὶ ἔθηκεν ὁ
ἱερεὺς ἐπισκόπους εἰς τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου. Καὶ ἔλαβε τοὺς ἑκατον- 19
τάρχους, καὶ τὸν Χορῥεί, καὶ τὸν Ῥασεὶμ, καὶ πάντα τὸν λαὸν
τῆς γῆς, καὶ κατήγαγεν τὸν βασιλέα ἐξ οἴκου Κυρίου, καὶ εἰσῆλθον
ὁδὸν πύλης τῶν παρατρεχόντων οἴκου τοῦ βασιλέως· καὶ ἐκάθισεν
(αὐτὸν) ἐπὶ θρόνου τῶν βασιλέων. Καὶ ἐχάρη πᾶς ὁ λαὸς τῆς γῆς, 20

**9** And the captains did all that Jehoiada the prudent had commanded. And each man took his men, even those who entered on the Sabbath with those who went out on the Sabbath, and they came unto Jehoiada the priest.

**10** And the priest gave unto the captains the shields and the spears of King David, which were in the house of the LORD.

**11** And the runners stood, every man with his weapon in his hand, from the right corner of the house unto the left corner of the house, by the altar and by the house, round about the king.

**12** And he brought forth the king's son, and placed upon him the crown, and the testimony, and made him king, and anointed him. And they clapped their hands, and cried, "Long live the king!"

**13** And when Athaliah heard the voice of the people running, she came unto the people into the house of the LORD,

**14** and she looked, and behold, the king stood by the pillar, as was the custom; and the singers and the trumpets were with the king, and all the people of the land rejoiced and blew with trumpets. Then Athaliah tore her garments, and cried, "Conspiracy! Conspiracy!"

**15** And Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains, the overseers of the force, and said unto them, "Lead her forth out of the guarded ranks; and whosoever followeth after her, let him be slain with the sword." For the priest had said, "Let her not die in the house of the LORD."

**16** And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way of the entry of the horses into the king's house, and there she died.

**17** And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD, and between the king, and between the people, that they should be the LORD's people; yea, and a covenant between the king and the people.

**18** And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and pulled it down; and they broke in pieces his altars and his images right thoroughly; and they slew Machan, the priest of Baal, before the altars. And the priest set overseers over the house of the LORD.

**19** And he took the captains, and Chorrhei, and Raseim, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of the LORD, and they came by the way of the gate of the runners to the king's house; and he seated [him] upon the throne of the kings.

**20** And all the people of the land rejoiced.
