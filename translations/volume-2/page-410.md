λοιμότητι, καὶ προσέχειν εἰς τὰ μετὰ ταῦτα, εἰς τὸ τὴν βασιλείαν ἀτάραχον τοῖς πᾶσιν ἀνθρώποις μετ᾿ εἰρήνης παρεξόμεθα, οὐ χρώμενοι ταῖς μεταβολαῖς, τὰ δὲ ὑπὸ τὴν ξίφιν ἐρχόμενα διακρίνοντες ἀεὶ μετὰ ἐπιεικεστέρας ἀπαντήσεως. Ὡς γὰρ Ἀμὰν Ἀμαδαθοῦ Μακεδὼν ταῖς ἀληθείαις ἀλλότριος τοῦ τῶν Περσῶν αἵματος, καὶ πολὺ διεστηκὼς τῆς ἡμετέρας χρηστότητος, ἐπιζενωθεὶς ἡμῖν, ἔτυχεν ἧς ἔχομεν πρὸς πᾶν ἔθνος φιλανθρωπίας ἐπὶ τοσοῦτον, ὥστε ἀναγορεύεσθαι ἡμῶν πατέρα, καὶ προσκυνούμενον ὑπὸ πάντων, τὸ δεύτερον τοῦ βασιλικοῦ θρόνου πρόσωπον διατελεῖν· οὐκ ἐνέγκας δὲ τὴν ὑπερηφανίαν, ἐπετήδευσε τῆς ἀρχῆς ἡμᾶς στερῆσαι, καὶ τοῦ πνεύματος, τόν τε ἡμέτερον σωτῆρα, καὶ διαπαντὸς εὐεργέτην Μαρδοχαῖον, καὶ τὴν ἄμεμπτον τῆς βασιλείας κοινωνὸν Ἐσθὴρ σὺν παντὶ τῷ τούτων ἔθνει, πολυπλόκοις μεθόδων παραλογισμοῖς αἰτησάμενος εἰς ἀπώλειαν· διὰ γὰρ τῶν τρόπων τούτων ᾠήθη λαβεῖν ἡμᾶς ἐρήμους, τήν τε Περσῶν ἐπικράτειαν εἰς τοὺς Μακεδόνας μετάξαι. ἡμεῖς δὲ τοὺς ὑπὸ τοῦ τρισαλιτηρίου παραδεδομένους εἰς ἀφανισμὸν Ἰουδαίους, εὑρίσκομεν κακούργους οὐκ ὄντας δικαιοτάτοις δὲ πολιτευομένους νόμοις, ὄντας δὲ υἱοὺς ὑψίστου μεγίστου ζῶντος Θεοῦ, τοῦ κατευθύνοντος ἡμῖν τε καὶ τοῖς προγόνοις ἡμῶν τὴν βασιλείαν ἐν τῇ καλλίστῃ διαθέσει. καλῶς οὖν ποιήσετε μὴ προχρησάμενοι τοῖς ὑπὸ Ἀμὰν Ἀμαδαθοῦ ἀποσταλεῖσι γράμμασι. διὰ τὸ αὐτὸν ταῦτα ἐξεργασάμενον πρὸς ταῖς Σούσων πύλαις ἐσταυρῶσθαι σὺν τῇ πανοικίᾳ, τὴν καταξίαν τοῦ τὰ πάντα ἐπικρατοῦντος Θεοῦ διατάχους ἀποδόντος αὐτῷ κρίσιν. τὸ δὲ ἀντίγραφον τῆς ἐπιστολῆς ταύτης ἐκτεθέντες ἐν παντὶ τόπῳ μετὰ παῤῥησίας, ἐᾶν τοὺς Ἰουδαίους χρῆσθαι τοῖς ἑαυτῶν νόμοις, καὶ συνεπισχύειν αὐτοῖς, ὅπως τοὺς ἐν καιρῷ θλίψεως ἐπιθεμένους αὐτοῖς, ἀμύνωνται τῇ τρισκαιδεκάτῃ τοῦ δωδεκάτου μηνὸς Ἀδὰρ τῇ αὐτῇ ἡμέρᾳ. ταύτην γὰρ ὁ ἐπὶ πάντα δυναστεύων Θεὸς ἀντ᾿ ὀλεθρίας τοῦ ἐκλεκτοῦ γένους, ἐποίησεν αὐτοῖς εὐφροσύνην. καὶ ὑμεῖς οὖν ἐν ταῖς ἐπωνύμοις ὑμῶν ἑορταῖς, ἐπίσημον ἡμέραν μετὰ πάσης εὐωχίας ἄγετε, ὅπως καὶ νῦν καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα σωτηρία μὲν ὑμῶν, καὶ τῶν εὐνοούντων τοῖς Πέρσαις, τῶν δὲ ὑμῖν ἐπιβουλευσάντων μνημόσυνον τῆς ἀπωλείας. πᾶσα δὲ πόλις ἢ χώρα τὸ σύνολον, ἥτις κατὰ ταῦτα μὴ ποιήσῃ, δόρατι καὶ πυρὶ καταναλωθήσεται μετ᾿ ὀργῆς. οὐ μόνον ἀνθρώ-

...[by] the pestilence [of their corruption]; and to give heed unto the things which follow, to the end that we may provide the kingdom undisturbed unto all men with peace, not making use of alterations, but ever discerning those matters which come under the sword with a more equitable response. Forasmuch as Haman, the son of Hammedatha, a Macedonian, was in truth alien from the blood of the Persians, and far removed from our goodness, yet, being received by us, he obtained of that benevolence which we bear towards every nation to such a measure, that he was proclaimed our father, and, being worshipped by all, did continue as the second person of the royal throne; but he, being unable to bear his pride, did contrive to deprive us of our dominion and of our very spirit, and [did also seek to destroy] Mordecai, our savior and perpetual benefactor, and Esther, the blameless partner of our kingdom, together with all their nation, having sought their utter destruction by intricate deceits and cunning methods. For by these means he deemed to render us desolate, and to transfer the sovereignty of the Persians unto the Macedonians. But we find that the Jews, who were by that thrice-accursed man delivered unto annihilation, are no evildoers, but rather do govern themselves by most righteous laws; and that they are the sons of the Most High, Most Great, Living God, Who doth ever direct our kingdom, both for us and for our forefathers, in the most excellent disposition. Therefore shall ye do well not to make fore-use of the letters sent by Haman, the son of Hammedatha; for he, having wrought these things, hath been crucified at the gates of Susa with his whole household, the God Who holdeth sway over all things having swiftly rendered unto him a judgment [most] worthy [of his deeds]. And the copy of this epistle having been set forth in every place with all boldness, ye are to permit the Jews to make use of their own laws, and to give them aid; to the end that they may defend themselves against those who shall assault them in the time of distress, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, Adar, upon that very day. For this day hath God, Who reigneth over all, made unto them a day of rejoicing, instead of destruction for the chosen race. And ye, therefore, in your memorial feasts, shall keep this day as a notable day with all feasting, so that both now and hereafter there may be salvation for you, and for them that bear goodwill unto the Persians, but for those who did conspire against you, a memorial of their destruction. And every city or country whatsoever, which shall not perform according to these commandments, shall be consumed by spear and by fire with wrath, not only to men...
