ΕΤΟΥΣ δευτέρου βασιλεύοντος Ἀρταξέρξου τοῦ μεγάλου βασιλέως τῇ μιᾷ τοῦ Νισάν, ἐνύπνιον εἶδε Μαρδοχαῖος ὁ τοῦ Ἰαΐρου, τοῦ Σεμεΐου, τοῦ Κισαίου, ἐκ τῆς φυλῆς Βενιαμείν, ἄνθρωπος Ἰουδαῖος, οἰκῶν ἐν Σούσοις τῇ πόλει, ἄνθρωπος μέγας, θεραπεύων ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ τοῦ βασιλέως˙ ἦν δὲ ἐκ τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας, ἧς ᾐχμαλώτευσε Ναβουχοδονόσορ ὁ βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος ἐξ Ἱερουσαλὴμ, μετὰ Ἰεχονίου τοῦ βασιλέως τῆς Ἰουδαίας˙ καὶ τοῦτο αὐτοῦ τὸ ἐνύπνιον˙ καὶ ἰδοὺ φωναὶ θορύβου, βρονταὶ, καὶ σεισμὸς, καὶ τάραχος ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς. Καὶ ἰδοὺ δύο δράκοντες μεγάλοι, ἕτοιμοι προσῆλθον ἀμφότεροι παλαίειν˙ καὶ ἐγένοντο αὐτῶν φωναὶ μεγάλαι, καὶ τῇ φωνῇ αὐτῶν ἡτοιμάσθη πᾶν ἔθνος εἰς πόλεμον, ὥστε πολεμῆσαι δικαίων ἔθνος. Καὶ ἰδοὺ ἡμέρα σκότους καὶ γνόφου, θλίψις καὶ στενοχωρία, καὶ κάκωσις καὶ τάραχος μέγας ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἐταράχθη πᾶν ἔθνος δίκαιον φοβούμενοι τὰ ἑαυτῶν κακὰ, καὶ ἡτοιμάσθησαν ἀπολέσθαι, καὶ ἐδέησαν πρὸς τὸν Θεόν. ἀπὸ δὲ τῆς βρῶς αὐτῶν ἐγένετο ὡσανεὶ ἀπὸ μικρᾶς πηγῆς ποταμὸς μέγας, ὕδωρ πολύ. καὶ φῶς καὶ ὁ ἥλιος ἀνέτειλε, καὶ οἱ ταπεινοὶ ὑψώθησαν, καὶ κατέφαγον τοὺς ἐνδόξους˙ καὶ διεγερθεὶς Μαρδοχαῖος ὁ ἑωρακὼς τὸ ἐνύπνιον τοῦτο, καὶ τί ὁ Θεὸς βεβούλευται ποιῆσαι, εἶχε τὸ ἐνύπνιον τοῦτο ἐν καρδίᾳ, καὶ ἐν παντὶ λόγῳ ἠθέλησεν αὐτὸ ἐπιγνῶναι ἕως νυκτός˙ καὶ ἡσύχασε Μαρδοχαῖος ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ μετὰ Γαβαθὰ καὶ Θάρρα τῶν δύο εὐνούχων τοῦ βασιλέως, τῶν φυλασσόντων τὴν αὐλὴν, ἤκουσε γὰρ τοὺς λογισμοὺς αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰς μερίμνας αὐτῶν ἐξηρεύνησε. καὶ ἔμαθεν, ὅτι ἑτοιμάζουσι τὰς χεῖρας ἐπιβαλεῖν Ἀρταξέρξη τῷ βασιλεῖ. καὶ ὑπέδειξε τῷ βασιλεῖ περὶ αὐτῶν. καὶ ἐζήτησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τοὺς δύο εὐνούχους, καὶ ὁμολογήσαντες ἀπήγχθησαν. Καὶ ἔγραψεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τοὺς λόγους τούτους εἰς μνημόσυνον, καὶ Μαρδοχαῖος ἔγραψε περὶ τῶν λόγων τούτων. καὶ ἐπέταξεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Μαρδοχαίῳ θεραπεύειν ἐν τῇ

##### CHAPTER XI

<sup>2</sup> In the second year of the reign of Artaxerxes the Great King, on the first day of Nisan, Mardochaios, the son of Jair, the son of Semeias, the son of Kiseos, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Jewish man, dwelling in Susa the city, a great man, ministering in the court of the king;
<sup>3</sup> he was one of those carried away captive, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away captive from Jerusalem, with Jechonias the king of Judaea. And this was his dream:
<sup>4</sup> And behold, there were sounds of tumult, and thunders, and an earthquake, and a disturbance upon the earth.
<sup>5</sup> And behold, two great dragons, made ready, came forth both to wrestle;
<sup>6</sup> and great voices were made by them, and at their voice every nation was prepared for war, so as to make war against a nation of righteous men.
<sup>8</sup> And behold, a day of darkness and of gloom, tribulation and distress, and great vexation and disturbance upon the earth;
<sup>9</sup> and every righteous nation was disturbed, fearing their own evils,
<sup>10</sup> and they were prepared to perish, and they made supplication unto God.
<sup>11</sup> And from their eating there came to be as it were from a small spring a great river, [even] much water.
<sup>12</sup> And light and the sun arose, and the humble were exalted, and they devoured the glorious ones.

##### CHAPTER XII

<sup>1</sup> And Mardochaios, having awakened, who had seen this dream, and what God had purposed to do, held this dream in his heart, and with all diligence he sought to discern it until night.
<sup>5</sup> And Mardochaios rested in the court with Gabatha and Tharra, the two eunuchs of the king, who guarded the court; for he heard their reasonings, and he searched out their concerns.
<sup>6</sup> And he learned that they were preparing to lay hands upon Artaxerxes the king.
<sup>7</sup> And he showed them unto the king. And the king sought out the two eunuchs, and having confessed, they were hanged.
<sup>8</sup> And the king wrote these things for a memorial, and Mardochaios wrote concerning these matters. And the king commanded Mardochaios to serve in the court.
