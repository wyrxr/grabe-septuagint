βαωνίτας, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτούς. Καὶ οἱ Γαβαωνῖται οὐχὶ υἱοὶ 2
Ἰσραὴλ εἰσιν, ἔτι ἀλλ’ ἢ ἐκ λείμματος τοῦ Ἀμορραίου, καὶ οἱ
υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ὤμοσαν αὐτοῖς. Καὶ ἐζήτησε Σαοὺλ πατάξαι αὐτοὺς 3
ἐν τῷ ζηλῶσαι αὐτὸν τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ καὶ Ἰούδα. Καὶ εἶπε
Δαυὶδ πρὸς τοὺς Γαβαωνίτας· τί ποιήσω ὑμῖν; καὶ ἐν τίνι ἐξιλάσομαι,
καὶ εὐλογήσητε τὴν κληρονομίαν Κυρίου; Καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῷ 4
οἱ Γαβαωνῖται· οὐκ ἔστιν ἡμῖν ἀργύριον καὶ χρυσίον μετὰ Σαούλ,
καὶ μετὰ τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἡμῖν ἀνὴρ θανατῶσαι
ἐν Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ εἶπε· τί ὑμεῖς λέγετε, καὶ ποιήσω ὑμῖν; Καὶ εἶ- 5
παν πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα· ὁ ἀνὴρ ὃς συνετέλεσεν ἐφ’ ἡμᾶς, καὶ ἐδίωξεν ἡμᾶς ὃς παρελογίσατο ἐξολοθρεῦσαι ἡμᾶς, ἀφανίσωμεν αὐτὸν, τοῦ μὴ
ἐστάναι αὐτὸν ἐν παντὶ ὁρίῳ Ἰσραήλ. Δότω ἡμῖν ἑπτὰ ἄνδρας ἐκ 6
τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐξηλιάσωμεν αὐτοὺς τῷ Κυρίῳ ἐν Γαβαὼν
Σαούλ, ἐκλεκτὸς Κυρίου. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεύς· ἐγὼ δώσω. Καὶ ἐφεί- 7
σατο ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐπὶ Μεμφιβοσθαί, υἱὸν Ἰωνάθαν υἱοῦ Σαούλ, διὰ τὸν
ὅρκον Κυρίου τὸν ἀναμέσον αὐτῶν, καὶ ἀναμέσον Δαυὶδ καὶ ἀναμέσον Ἰωνάθαν υἱοῦ Σαούλ. Καὶ ἔλαβεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τοὺς δύο υἱοὺς 8
Ῥεσφὰ θυγατρὸς Ἀϊᾶ οὓς ἔτεκε τῷ Σαούλ, τὸν Ἑρμωνιεί,
καὶ τὸν Μεμφιβοσθαί, καὶ τοὺς πέντε υἱοὺς Μιχὰλ θυγατρὸς Σαούλ, 9
οὓς ἔτεκε τῷ Ἐσδριήλ, υἱῷ Βερζελλεὶ τῷ Μουλαβείτῃ. Καὶ
ἔδωκεν αὐτοὺς ἐν χειρὶ τῶν Γαβαωνιτῶν, καὶ ἐξηλίασαν αὐτοὺς ἐν
τῷ ὄρει ἐναντίον Κυρίου. Καὶ ἔπεσαν οἱ ἑπτὰ αὐτοὶ ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό·
καὶ αὐτοὶ δὲ ἐθανατώθησαν ἐν ἡμέραις θερισμοῦ, ἐν πρώτοις, ἐν 10
ἀρχῇ θερισμοῦ κριθῶν. Καὶ ἔλαβε Ῥεσφὰ θυγάτηρ Ἀϊᾶ τὸν σάκκον,
καὶ ἔπηξεν αὐτῇ πρὸς τὴν πέτραν ἐν ἀρχῇ θερισμοῦ κριθῶν,
ἕως ἔσταξεν ὕδωρ ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ· καὶ οὐκ ἔδωκε τὰ
πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καταπαῦσαι ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς ἡμέρας, καὶ τὰ θηρία 11
τοῦ ἀγροῦ νυκτός. Καὶ ἀπηγγέλη τῷ Δαυὶδ ὅσα ἐποίησε Ῥεσφὰ,
θυγάτηρ Ἀϊᾶ, παλλακὴ Σαούλ, καὶ ἐξελύθησαν. Καὶ κατέλαβεν 12
αὐτοὺς Δὰν υἱὸς Ἰωὰ ἐκ τῶν ἀπογόνων τῶν γιγάντων. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη
Δαυὶδ, καὶ ἔλαβε τὰ ὀστᾶ Σαούλ, καὶ τὰ ὀστᾶ Ἰωνάθαν
τοῦ υἱοῦ παρὰ τῶν ἀνδρῶν υἱῶν Ἰαβεὶς Γαλαάδ, οἳ ἔκλεψαν αὐτοὺς ἐκ τῆς πλατείας Βηθσάν, ὅτι ἔστησαν αὐτοὺς ἐκεῖ οἱ
ἀλλόφυλοι ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ᾗ ἐπάταξαν [αὐτὸν] οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι ἐν Γελ- 13
βουὲ τὸν Σαούλ. Καὶ ἀνήνεγκεν ἐκεῖθεν τὰ ὀστᾶ Σαούλ, καὶ
τὰ ὀστᾶ Ἰωνάθαν τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ συνήγαγε τὰ ὀστᾶ

**CHAPTER 21**

**2** ...the Gibeonites, and spake unto them. Now the Gibeonites were not indeed sons of Israel, but rather yet of the remnant of the Amorites; and the sons of Israel had sworn unto them.

**3** But Saul sought to smite them down, in his fervent zeal for the sons of Israel and Judah. Then David said unto the Gibeonites, 'What shall I do for you? And with what shall I make expiation, that ye may bless the inheritance of the Lord?'

**4** And the Gibeonites answered him, 'We have no [desire for] silver or gold from Saul, nor from his house; neither is it for us to put a man to death in Israel.'

**5** And he said, 'What say ye, that I should do for you?' And they answered the king, 'The man who consumed us, and persecuted us, who devised to utterly destroy us, let him be utterly destroyed, so that he may not remain in any border of Israel.

**6** Give unto us seven men of his sons, that we may hang them up unto the Lord in Gibeon of Saul, the chosen of the Lord.'

**7** And the king said, 'I will give them.' But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of the oath of the Lord which was between them, even between David and between Jonathan, the son of Saul.

**8** And the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth;

And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites; and they hanged them up on the mountain before the Lord. And the seven of them fell together; and they were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, in the beginning of the barley harvest.

**10** And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for herself upon the rock, from the beginning of barley harvest until water dropped upon them from heaven; and she suffered not the fowls of the air to rest upon them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.

**11** And it was reported unto David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, Saul's concubine, had done, and they were released.

**12** And Dan the son of Joah, of the descendants of the giants, overtook them. And David went, and took the bones of Saul, and the bones of Jonathan his son, from the men of Jabesh-Gilead, who had stolen them from the broad place of Bethshan; for the Philistines had set them up there on the day when the Philistines smote [him], even Saul, in Gilboa.

**13** And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul, and the bones of Jonathan his son, and gathered the bones...
