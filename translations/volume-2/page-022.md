ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Α΄. ΚΕΦ. Γ΄.
3 ἤσω ὑπὲρ τοῦ υἱοῦ μου; Καὶ ἀπελεύσῃ ἐκεῖθεν, καὶ ἐπέκεινα ἥξεις
ἕως τῆς δρυὸς Θαβώρ, καὶ εὑρήσεις ἐκεῖ τρεῖς ἄνδρας ἀναβαίνοντας
πρὸς τὸν Θεὸν εἰς Βαιθήλ, ἕνα αἴροντα τρία αἰγίδια, καὶ ἕνα αἴροντα
τρία ἀγγεῖα ἄρτων, καὶ ἕνα αἴροντα ἀσκὸν οἴνου·
4 καὶ ἐρωτήσουσι σε τὰ εἰς εἰρήνην, καὶ δώσουσι σοι δύο ἀπαρχὰς
ἄρτων, καὶ λήψῃ ἐκ τῆς χειρὸς αὐτῶν.
5 Καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα εἰσελεύσῃ εἰς τὸν βουνὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ, οὗ ἐστιν (τὸ ἀνάστημα
τῶν ἀλλοφύλων) ἐκεῖ Νασὶβ ὁ ἀλλόφυλος. καὶ ἔσται ὡς ἂν εἰσέλθητε ἐκεῖ
εἰς τὴν πόλιν, καὶ ἀπαντήσεις χορῷ προφητῶν καταβαινόντων ἐκ τῆς Βαμᾶ,
καὶ ἔμπροσθεν αὐτῶν νάβλα, καὶ τύμπανα, καὶ αὐλός, καὶ κινύρα, καὶ αὐτοὶ
6 προφητεύοντες· καὶ ἐφαλεῖται ἐπὶ σὲ πνεῦμα Κυρίου, καὶ προφητεύσεις μετ᾿
αὐτῶν, καὶ στραφήσῃ εἰς ἄνδρα ἄλλον.
7 Καὶ ἔσται ὅταν ἥξῃ τὰ σημεῖα ταῦτα ἐπὶ σέ, ποίει πάντα ὅσα ἐὰν εὕρῃ ἡ
χείρ σου, ὅτι Θεὸς μετὰ σοῦ.
8 Καὶ καταβήσῃ ἔμπροσθεν τῆς Γάλγαλα, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ καταβαίνω πρὸς σὲ
ἀνενεγκεῖν ὁλοκαύτωσιν καὶ θῦσαι θυσίας εἰρηνικάς· ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας διαλείψεις
ἕως τοῦ ἐλθεῖν με πρὸς σέ, καὶ γνωρίσω σοι ἃ ποιήσεις.
9 Καὶ ἐγενήθη ὥστε ἐπιστραφῆναι τῷ ὤμῳ αὐτοῦ ἀπελθεῖν ἀπὸ Σαμουήλ, καὶ
μετέστρεψεν αὐτῷ ὁ Θεὸς καρδίαν ἄλλην· καὶ ἦλθε πάντα τὰ σημεῖα ταῦτα ἐν
τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ.
10 Καὶ ἔρχεται ἐκεῖθεν εἰς τὸν βουνὸν (τῶν προφητῶν) καὶ ἰδοὺ χορὸς προφητῶν
ἐξεναντίας αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἥλατο ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν πνεῦμα Θεοῦ, καὶ προεφήτευσεν ἐν μέσῳ
αὐτῶν.
11 Καὶ ἐγενήθησαν ἅπαντες οἱ εἰδότες αὐτὸν ἐχθὲς καὶ τρίτης, καὶ εἶδον, καὶ
ἰδοὺ αὐτὸς ἐν μέσῳ τῶν προφητῶν προφητεύων· καὶ εἶπαν ὁ λαὸς ἕκαστος πρὸς
τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ· τί τοῦτο τὸ γεγονὸς τῷ υἱῷ Κείσ; ἢ καὶ Σαοὺλ ἐν
προφήταις;
12 Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη τις αὐτῶν, καὶ εἶπε· καὶ τίς πατὴρ αὐτοῦ; οὐ Κείς; Διὰ τοῦτο
ἐγενήθη εἰς παραβολήν· ἢ καὶ Σαοὺλ ἐν προφήταις;
13 Καὶ συνετέλεσε προφητεύων, καὶ ἔρχεται εἰς τὸν βουνόν.
14 Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ οἰκεῖος αὐτοῦ πρὸς αὐτὸν καὶ πρὸς τὸ παιδάριον αὐτοῦ· ποῦ
ἐπορεύθητε;
15 Καὶ εἶπαν· ζητεῖν τὰς ὄνους, καὶ εἴδομεν ὅτι οὐκ εἰσι, καὶ εἰσήλθομεν πρὸς
Σαμουήλ.
16 Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ οἰκεῖος πρὸς Σαούλ· ἀπάγγειλον δή μοι, τί εἶπέ σοι Σαμουήλ;
Καὶ εἶπε Σαούλ πρὸς τὸν οἰκεῖον αὐτοῦ· ἀπήγγειλεν ἀπαγγέλλων μοι, ὅτι
εὕρηνται αἱ ὄνοι· τὸ δὲ ῥῆμα τῆς βασιλείας οὐκ ἀπήγγειλεν αὐτῷ ἃ εἶπε
Σαμουήλ.
17 Καὶ παρήγγειλε Σαμουὴλ

**1 Kings, Chapter 3** *(sic)*

3 "What shall I be unto my son?" And thou shalt go forth from thence, and shalt come further even unto the Oak of Tabor, and there shalt thou find three men going up unto God to Bethel; one bearing three kid-goats, and one bearing three loaves of bread, and one bearing a wineskin.
4 And they shall salute thee, and shall give unto thee two portions of bread, and thou shalt receive them from their hand.
5 And after this thou shalt come to the hill of God, where [is] (the garrison of the Philistines) even Nasib the Philistine. And it shall come to pass, as ye come thither unto the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the High Place, and before them [shall be] a lyre, and tambourines, and a flute, and a harp, and they themselves prophesying.
6 And the Spirit of the Lord shall leap upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.
7 And it shall be, when these signs are come unto thee, do thou whatsoever thy hand may find [to do]; for God is with thee.
8 And thou shalt go down before Gilgal, and behold, I come down unto thee to offer up a burnt offering, and to sacrifice peace offerings. Seven days shalt thou tarry, until I come unto thee, and I will make known unto thee what thou shalt do.
9 And it came to pass, as he turned about to go from Samuel, that God turned unto him another heart; and all these signs came to pass on that day.
10 And he came from thence to the hill (of the prophets), and behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God leaped upon him, and he prophesied in the midst of them.
11 And it came to pass, when all that knew him previously did see, and behold, he was in the midst of the prophets prophesying; then the people said every man to his neighbour, "What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?"
12 And one of them answered and said, "And who is his father? Is it not Kish?" Therefore it became a proverb, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"
13 And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the hill.
14 Then his kinsman said unto him, and unto his servant, "Whither went ye?"
15 And they said, "To seek the asses; and when we saw that they were not [found], we went in to Samuel."
16 Then his kinsman said to Saul, "Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto thee." And Saul said unto his kinsman, "He told me plainly that the asses were found; but of the matter of the kingdom, that which Samuel had said, he told him not."
17 And Samuel commanded
