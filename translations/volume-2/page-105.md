ΚΕΦ. ΙΗʹ.         ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Βʹ.         581
εὐαγγελίᾳ τῷ βασιλεῖ, ὅτι ἔκρινε Κύριος ἐκ χειρὸς τῶν ἐχθρῶν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Ἰωάβ· οὐκ ἀνὴρ εὐαγγελίας σὺ ἐν 20
τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ταύτῃ, καὶ εὐαγγελίῃ ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ἄλλῃ· ἐν δὲ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ
ταύτῃ οὐκ εὐαγγελίῃ, οὗ ἕνεκεν ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ βασιλέως ἀπέθανε.
Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰωὰβ τῷ Χουσεί· βαδίσας ἀνάγγειλον τῷ βασιλεῖ ὅσα 21
εἶδες. Καὶ προσεκύνησε Χουσεὶ τῷ Ἰωάβ, καὶ ἐξῆλθε. Καὶ προσέθετο 22
ἔτι Ἀχιμάας υἱὸς Σαδώκ, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς Ἰωάβ· καὶ ἔσται ὅτι δράμω καὶ ἐγὼ ὀπίσω τοῦ Χουσεί. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰωάβ· ἵνατί τοῦτο σὺ τρέχεις, υἱέ μου; δεῦρο, οὐκ ἔστι σοι εὐαγγελία πρὸς
ὠφέλειαν πορευομένῳ. Καὶ εἶπε· τί γὰρ ἐὰν δραμοῦμαι. Καὶ 23
εἶπεν αὐτῷ Ἰωάβ· δράμε. Καὶ ἔδραμεν Ἀχιμάας ὁδὸν τὴν τοῦ
Καιχάρ, καὶ ὑπερέβη τὸν Χουσεί. Καὶ Δαυὶδ ἐκάθητο ἀναμέσον 24
τῶν δύο πυλῶν. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη ὁ σκοπὸς εἰς τὸ δῶμα τῆς πύλης πρὸς τὸ τεῖχος, καὶ ἐπῆρε τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶδε,
καὶ ἰδοὺ ἀνὴρ τρέχων μόνος ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἀνεβόησεν ὁ σκοπὸς, 25
καὶ ἀπήγγειλε τῷ βασιλεῖ. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεύς· εἰ μόνος
ἐστὶν, εὐαγγελία ἐν τῷ στόματι αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐπορεύετο πορευόμενος καὶ ἐγγίζων. Καὶ εἶδεν ὁ σκοπὸς ἄνδρα ἕτερον τρέχοντα. 26
Καὶ ἐβόησεν ὁ σκοπὸς πρὸς τῇ πύλῃ, καὶ εἶπεν· ἰδοὺ ἀνὴρ ἕτερος τρέχων μόνος. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεύς· καὶ γε οὗτος εὐαγγελιζόμενος. 27
Εἶπε δὲ ὁ σκοπός· ἐγὼ ὁρῶ τὸν δρόμον τοῦ πρώτου ὡς δρόμον Ἀχιμάας υἱοῦ Σαδώκ. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεύς·
ἀνὴρ ἀγαθὸς οὗτος, καί γε εἰς εὐαγγελίαν ἀγαθὴν ἐλεύσεται. Καὶ 28
ἐβόησεν Ἀχιμάας, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα, εἰρήνη· καὶ προσεκύνησε τῷ βασιλεῖ ἐπὶ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, καὶ εἶπεν·
εὐλογητὸς Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου, ὡς ἀπέκλεισε τοὺς ἄνδρας τοὺς ἀντάραντας τὴν χεῖρα αὐτῶν ἐν τῷ κυρίῳ μου τῷ βασιλεῖ. Καὶ 29
εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεύς· εἰρήνη τῷ παιδαρίῳ, τῷ Ἀβεσσαλώμ; Καὶ εἶπεν Ἀχιμάας· εἶδον τὸ πλῆθος τὸ μέγα τοῦ ἀποστεῖλαι τὸν δοῦλον τοῦ βασιλέως Ἰωὰβ καὶ τὸν δοῦλόν σου, καὶ οὐκ ἔγνων τί
ἐκεῖ. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεύς· ἐπίστρεφον, στηλώθητι ὧδε. Καὶ 30
ἐπεστράφη, καὶ ἔστη. Καὶ ἰδοὺ ὁ Χουσεὶ παρεγένετο, καὶ εἶπε τῷ 31
βασιλεῖ· εὐαγγελισθήτω Χουσεὶ ὁ κύριός μου ὁ βασιλεύς, ὅτι ἔκρινέ σοι Κύριος σήμερον ἐκ χειρὸς πάντων τῶν ἐγειρομένων ἐπὶ
σέ. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς πρὸς τὸν Χουσεί· εἰ εἰρήνη τῷ παιδαρίῳ, 32
τῷ Ἀβεσσαλώμ; Καὶ εἶπε Χουσεί· γένοιτο, ὡς τὸ παι-

**19** ...bring good tidings unto the king, that the Lord hath judged [him] from the hand of his enemies.'

**20** And Joab said unto him, 'Thou art not a man to bring good tidings on this day; but thou shalt bring good tidings on another day. On this day thou shalt not bear glad tidings, because of him for whom the king's son is dead.'

**21** And Joab said unto Hushai, 'Go, and declare unto the king whatsoever thou hast seen.' And Hushai bowed himself down unto Joab, and he departed.

**22** And Ahimaaz the son of Zadok added yet [again], and he said unto Joab, 'And it shall be, that I also will run after Hushai.' And Joab said, 'Wherefore dost thou thus run, my son? [Draw] nigh, for there are no good tidings for thee to carry for profit.'

**23** And he said, 'But what if I run?' And Joab said unto him, 'Run!' And Ahimaaz ran by the way of the Kaiχar, and he outran Hushai.

**24** Now David sat between the two gates. And the watchman went up to the roof of the gate, toward the wall, and he lifted up his eyes, and he saw, and behold, a man running alone before him.

**25** And the watchman cried out, and told the king. And the king said, 'If he be alone, then good tidings are in his mouth.' And he went on, going and drawing nearer.

**26** And the watchman saw another man running. And the watchman cried out unto the gate, and said, 'Behold, another man running alone.' And the king said, 'And this man also is a bringer of good tidings.'

**27** Then the watchman said, 'I discern the running of the first man as the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.' And the king said, 'This man is a good man, and he shall surely come with good tidings.'

**28** And Ahimaaz cried out, and said unto the king, 'Peace!' And he bowed himself down to the king upon his face to the ground, and said, 'Blessed be the Lord thy God, who hath shut up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.'

**29** And the king said, 'Is it well with the young man, with Absalom?' And Ahimaaz said, 'I saw the great multitude at the dispatching of Joab, the king's servant, and of thy servant, and I knew not what was there.'

**30** And the king said, 'Turn aside, stand still here.' And he turned aside, and stood still.

**31** And behold, Hushai arrived, and said unto the king, 'Let good tidings be proclaimed! O my lord the King, for the Lord hath judged for thee this day from the hand of all them that rose up against thee.'

**32** And the king said unto Hushai, 'Is it well with the young man, with Absalom?' And Hushai said, 'May it be so, that the enemies of my lord the king, and all those who rise up against him for evil, be as the young man.'
