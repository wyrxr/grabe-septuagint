**11** ἀπὸ δὲ προσώπου μου οὐκ ἐφείσαντο πτυέλου. Ἀνοίξας (γὰρ ὧδε) φαρέτραν
**12** αὐτοῦ ἐκάκωσέ με· καὶ χαλινὸν τοῦ προσώπου μου ἐξαπέστειλαν·
**13** ἐπὶ δεξιῶν τοῦ βλαστοῦ ἐπανέστησαν, πόδας αὐτῶν ἐξέτειναν,
**14** καὶ ὡδοποίησαν ἐπ᾽ ἐμὲ τρίβους ἀπωλείας αὑτῶν. Ἐξετρίβησαν
τρίβοι μου· ἐξέδυσαν γάρ με τὴν στολήν μου. Βέλεσιν αὐτοῦ
**15** κατηκόντισέ με· κέχρηται δέ μοι ὡς ἐβούλετο. Ἐν ὀδύναις πέφυρμαι,
**16** ἐπιστρέφονται (δὲ) μοι αἱ ὀδύναι· ᾤχετό μου ἡ ἐλπὶς
ὥσπερ πνεῦμα, καὶ ὥσπερ νέφος ἡ σωτηρία μου παρῆλθεν.
**17** Καὶ νῦν ἐπ᾽ ἐμὲ ἐχυθήσεται ἡ ψυχή μου· ἔχουσι δέ με ἡμέραι
ὀδυνῶν, νυκτὸς δέ μου τὰ ὀστᾶ συνέθλασαν, καὶ τὰ νεῦρά μου
**18** διαλύεται. Ἐν πολλῇ ἰσχύϊ ἐπελάβετό μου τῆς στολῆς· ὥσπερ
**19** τὸ περιστόμιον τοῦ χιτῶνός μου περιέσχε με. Ἤγηται δέ με
**20** ἴσα πηλῷ· ἐν γῇ καὶ σποδῷ ἡ μερίς μου. Κέκραγα δὲ πρὸς σέ,
**21** καὶ οὐκ εἰσακούεις μου· ἔστησα, καὶ κατενόησάς με. Ἐπέθησας
**22** δέ μοι ἀνελεημόνως, ὡς χειρὶ κραταιᾷ με ἐμαστίγωσας· ἔταξας
**23** δέ με ἐν ὀδύναις, καὶ ἀπέρριψάς με ἀπὸ σωτηρίας. Οἶδα γὰρ
**24** ὅτι θανάτός με ἐκτρίψει· οἰκία γὰρ γῇ παντὶ θνητῷ. Εἰ γὰρ
ὄφελον δυναίμην ἐμαυτὸν χειρώσασθαι, ἢ δεηθῆναι ἑτέρου, καὶ
**25** ποιήσει μοι τοῦτο. Ἐγὼ δὲ ἐπὶ παντὶ ἀδυνάτῳ ἔκλαυσα, καὶ
**26** ἐστέναξα ἰδὼν ἄνδρα ἐν ἀνάγκῃ.—Καὶ ἐπέχων ἐγὼ ἐν ἀγαθοῖς·
**27** καὶ ἰδοὺ συνήντησάν μοι μᾶλλον ἡμέραι κακῶν. Ἡ κοιλία μου
ἐξέζεσε, καὶ οὐ σιωπήσεται· προέφθασαν (δέ) με ἡμέραι
**28** πτωχείας. Στενῶν πεπόρευμαι ἄνευ θυμοῦ· ἕστηκα δὲ ἐν
**29** ἐκκλησίᾳ κεκραγώς. Ἀδελφὸς γέγονα σειρήνων, ἑταῖρος δὲ
**30** στρουθῶν.—Τὸ (δὲ) δέρμα μου μεμελάνωται μεγάλως, τὰ δὲ ὀστᾶ μου
**31** ἀπὸ καύματος συνεφρύγη.—Ἀπέβη δὲ εἰς πένθος ἡ κιθάρα μου,
ὁ δὲ ψαλμός μου εἰς κλαυθμὸν (ἐμοί).

## CHAPTER XXX.

**11** [They have not spared] to spit upon my face. For he hath opened his quiver here, and afflicted me;
**12** and they let loose the bridle upon my countenance.
**13** Upon the right [side] of my shoot did they rise up; their feet did they stretch forth,
**14** and they did make upon me the paths of their own destruction. My paths were broken down; for they did strip me of my raiment. With his arrows did he shoot me down;
**15** and he hath dealt with me as he pleased. In pangs am I steeped,
**16** and the pangs return unto me; my hope hath departed as a spirit, and as a cloud hath my salvation passed by.
**17** And now upon me shall my soul be poured out; and days of anguish hold me fast, and by night have they crushed my bones, and my sinews
**18** are dissolved. With great strength did he lay hold of my raiment; as
**19** the collar of my tunic, so hath it encompassed me. And he hath accounted me
**20** as the mud; in earth and in ashes is my portion. And I cried out unto Thee, O Lord,
**21** and Thou dost not hearken unto me. I did stand [before Thee], and Thou didst observe me. Thou hast laid upon
**22** me without mercy, as with a mighty hand Thou didst scourge me; Thou hast set
**23** me in anguish, and Thou hast cast me off from salvation. For I know
**24** that Death shall utterly destroy me; for the earth is the house for every mortal man. O that I might control myself, or entreat another, and he shall do this for me.
**25** But I did weep for every helpless man, and I did groan when I saw a man in distress.—
**26** And though I waited in good fortune;
**27** behold, rather, days of evil have encountered me. My belly hath boiled over, and it shall not cease [its lament]; and the days of poverty have overtaken me.
**28** I have walked in distress without [my] passion; and I stood in the assembly, crying out.
**29** I am become a brother to the sirens, and a companion to the ostriches.—
**30** And my skin is greatly blackened, and my bones were scorched by the fever.—
**31** And my lyre hath been turned into mourning, and my psalm into weeping for me.

## CHAPTER XXXI.

**1** I made a covenant with mine eyes; and I shall not heed [to look] upon a virgin.
**2** For what portion hath God given from above, and what inheritance of the Almighty from the Most High?
**3** Is it not destruction for the unrighteous, and alienation for them that work iniquity?
**4** Doth He not Himself behold my way, and shall He not number all my steps?
**5** If indeed I had walked with jesters, or if he had hastened into deceit, the
