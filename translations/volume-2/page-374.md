12 Καὶ ἀνέστην νυκτός, ἐγὼ καὶ ἄνδρες ὀλίγοι μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ, καὶ οὐκ
    ἀπήγγειλα ἀνθρώπῳ τί ὁ Θεὸς δίδωσιν εἰς καρδίαν μου τοῦ ποιῆ-
    σαι μετὰ τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ κτῆνος οὐκ ἔστι μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ, εἰ μὴ τὸ
13 κτῆνος ᾧ ἐγὼ ἐπιβαίνω ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ. Καὶ ἐξῆλθον ἐν πύλῃ τοῦ Γω-
    ηλά, καὶ πρὸς στόμα πηγῆς τῶν συκῶν, καὶ εἰς πύλην τῆς κο-
    πρίας. καὶ ἤμην συντρίβων ἐν τῷ τείχει Ἱερουσαλὴμ δ᾽ αὐτοὶ καθ-
    αιροῦσι, καὶ πύλαι αὐτῆς κατεβρώθησαν ἐν πυρί.
14 Καὶ παρῆλθον ἐπὶ πύλην τοῦ Ἂὶν καὶ εἰς κολυμβήθραν τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ οὐκ ἦν τό-
    πος τῷ κτήνει παρελθεῖν ὑποκάτω μου.
15 Καὶ ἤμην ἀναβαίνων ἐν τῷ τείχει χειμάρρου νυκτός· καὶ ἤμην συντρίβων ἐν τῷ τείχει,
16 καὶ ἤμην ἐν πύλῃ τῆς φάραγγος, καὶ ἐπέστρεψα. Καὶ οἱ φυλάσ-
    σοντες οὐκ ἔγνωσαν τί ἐπορεύθην, καὶ τί ἐγὼ ποιῶ· καὶ τοῖς Ἰου-
    δαίοις, καὶ τοῖς ἱερεῦσι, καὶ τοῖς ἐντίμοις, καὶ τοῖς στρατηγοῖς,
    καὶ τοῖς καταλοίποις τοῖς ποιοῦσι τὰ ἔργα, ἕως τότε οὐκ ἀπήγ-
17 γειλα. Καὶ εἶπα πρὸς αὐτούς· ὑμεῖς βλέπετε τὴν πονηρίαν, ἐν ᾗ
    ἐσμὲν ἐν αὐτῇ, πῶς Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἔρημος, καὶ αἱ πύλαι αὐτῆς ἐδό-
    θησαν πυρί· δεῦτε, καὶ διοικοδομήσωμεν τὸ τεῖχος Ἱερουσαλήμ,
18 καὶ οὐκ ἐσόμεθα ἔτι ὄνειδος. Καὶ ἀπήγγειλα αὐτοῖς τὴν χεῖρα
    τοῦ Θεοῦ ἣ ἔστιν ἀγαθὴ ἐπ᾿ ἐμέ, καὶ τοὺς λόγους τοῦ βασιλέως
    οὓς εἶπέ μοι· καὶ εἶπα, ἀναστῶμεν, καὶ οἰκοδομήσωμεν· καὶ ἐκρα-
19 ταιώθησαν αἱ χεῖρες αὐτῶν εἰς ἀγαθόν. Καὶ ἤκουσε Σαναβαλλὰτ
    ὁ Ἀρωνί, καὶ Τωβία ὁ δοῦλος δ᾽ Ἀμμωνὶ, καὶ Γησὰμ ὁ Ἀραβί,
    καὶ ἐξεγέλασαν ἡμᾶς, καὶ ἦλθον ἐφ᾿ ἡμᾶς, καὶ εἶπον· τί τὸ ῥῆμα
20 τοῦτο ὃ ὑμεῖς ποιεῖτε; ἢ ἐπὶ τὸν βασιλέα ὑμεῖς ἀποστατεῖτε; Καὶ
    ἐπέστρεψα αὐτοῖς λόγον, καὶ εἶπα αὐτοῖς· ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ οὐρανοῦ αὐ-
    τὸς εὐοδώσει ἡμῖν, καὶ ἡμεῖς δοῦλοι αὐτοῦ καθαροί, καὶ οἰκοδο-
    μήσομεν. καὶ ὑμῖν οὐκ ἔστι μερίς, καὶ δικαιοσύνη, καὶ μνημόσυνον
    ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ.

ΚΕΦ. Γ΄. ΙΙΙ.

1   ΚΑΙ ἀνέστη Ἐλισοὺβ ὁ ἱερεὺς ὁ μέγας, καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ
    οἱ ἱερεῖς, καὶ ᾠκοδόμησαν τὴν πύλην τὴν προβατικήν· αὐτοὶ ἡγία-
    σαν αὐτήν, καὶ ἔστησαν θύρας αὐτῆς, καὶ ἕως πύργου τῶν ἑκα-
2   τὸν ἡγίασαν, ἕως πύργου Ἀναμεήλ. Καὶ ἐπὶ χεῖρας υἱῶν ἀνδρῶν

12 And I arose by night, I and a few men with me; and I told no man what God had put into my heart to do for Israel. And there was no beast with me, save the beast whereon I rode.
13 Then I went forth by the Gate of Golah, and toward the mouth of the Fountain of the Fig Trees, and to the Dung Gate. And I was making my way through the breaches in the wall of Jerusalem, and they themselves did pull it down; and its gates were consumed with fire.
14 And I passed on to the Ain Gate, and to the King's Pool; and there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass through.
15 And I was going up along the wall of the ravine by night; and I was making my way through the breaches in the wall, and I was at the Valley Gate, and I returned.
16 Now the guards knew not whither I went, nor what I was doing. Neither had I yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.
17 Then said I unto them, "Ye see the distress wherein we are, how Jerusalem lieth waste, and its gates are given unto fire. Come now, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we may be no more a reproach."
18 And I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; and also of the words of the king which he had spoken unto me. And I said, "Let us arise, and build." So they strengthened their hands for good.
19 But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, and the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arab, heard thereof, they scoffed at us; and they came unto us, and said, "What is this thing that ye do? Will ye rebel against the king?"
20 Then I answered them a word, and said unto them, "The God of heaven, He shall prosper us; and we His pure servants, we shall build. But ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial in Jerusalem."

CHAPTER III.

1 Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests, and they built the Sheep Gate. They sanctified it, and set up the doors thereof; and they sanctified it even unto the Tower of the Hundred, unto the Tower of Anameel.
2 And next to them built the men of Jericho; and next to them built the sons of Zachuur the son of Amari.
3 And the Fish Gate built the sons of Hasana; they roofed it, and set up its doors, and its bolts, and its bars.
