ΚΕΦ. ΙΗʹ. ΙΘʹ.                                             Ι Ω Β.                                    909
θηρεύσειαν τὰ ὑπάρχοντα αὐτοῦ ἐλάχιστοι, καὶ σφαλείη αὐτοῦ ἡ βουλή. 8
Ἐμβληθείη δὲ ὁ ποῦς αὐτοῦ ἐν παγίδι, καὶ ἐν δικτύῳ εἰλιχθείη· ἔλθοισαν δὲ 9
ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν παγίδες (κύκλοθεν, καὶ) κατισχύσει ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν διψῶντας·
κέρυπται δὲ ἐν τῇ γῇ σχοινίον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἡ σύλληψις αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ 10
τρίβον κύκλοθεν. (Καὶ) ὀλέσειαν αὐτὸν ὀδῦναι· πολλοὶ δὲ περὶ πόδας 11
αὐτοῦ ἔλθοισαν ἐν λιμῷ στενῷ, καὶ πτῶμα αὐτῷ ἡτοίμαστο 12
ἐξαίσιον. Βρωθείησαν αὐτοῦ κλῶνες ποδῶν, κατέδεται δὲ αὐτοῦ 13
τὰ ὡραῖα θάνατος. Ἐκραυγείη δὲ ἐκ διαίτης αὐτοῦ ἴασις· σχοίη 14
δὲ αὐτὸν ἀνάγκη (καὶ) αἰτία βασιλικὴ, κατασκηνώσει ἐν τῇ σκηνῇ 15
αὐτοῦ (καὶ) ἐν νυκτὶ αὐτοῦ. Κατασπαρήσεται τὰ εὐπρεπῆ αὐτοῦ
θείῳ· ὑποκάτωθεν αἱ ῥίζαι αὐτοῦ ξηρανθήσονται, καὶ ἐπάνωθεν 16
ἐπιπεσεῖται θερισμὸς αὐτοῦ. Τὸ μνημόσυνον αὐτοῦ ἀπόλοιτο ἐκ 17
γῆς, καὶ οὐκ ὑπάρχοι ὄνομα αὐτῷ ἐπὶ πρόσωπον ἐξωτέρω· (καὶ) 18
ἀπώσειαν αὐτὸν ἐκ φωτὸς εἰς σκότος. Οὐκ ἔσται ἐπίγνωστος ἐν 19
τῷ λαῷ αὐτοῦ, οὐδὲ σεσωσμένος ἐν τῇ ὑπ᾿ οὐρανὸν ὁ οἶκος αὐτοῦ·
ἀλλ᾿ ἐν τοῖς αὐτοῦ ζήσονται ἕτεροι. Ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ ἐξενάξαν ἔσχατοι· 20
πρώτους δὲ ἔσχε θαῦμα. Οὗτοι εἰσιν οἶκοι ἀδίκων, οὗτος δὲ τρόπος 21
τῶν μὴ εἰδότων τὸν Κύριον.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΘʹ. XIX.

ὙΠΟΛΑΒΩΝ δὲ Ἰὼβ, λέγει· ἕως πότε ἔγκοπον ποιήσετε 1.2
τὴν ψυχήν μου, καὶ καθελεῖτέ με λόγοις; Γνῶτε μόνον, ὅτι ὁ 3
Κύριος ἐποίησέ μοι οὕτως· (καὶ) καταλαλεῖτέ με, οὐκ αἰσχυνόμενοι 4
(με καὶ) ἐπικεισθέ μοι. Ναὶ δὴ ἐγὼ ἐπ᾿ ἀληθείας ἐπλανήθην, καὶ
παρ᾿ ἐμοὶ αὔλιζεται πλάνος, λαλήσαι ῥῆμα ὃ οὐκ ἔδει, τὰ δὲ ῥή-
ματά μου πλανᾶται, καὶ οὐκ ἐπὶ καιροῦ. Ἔα δὲ ὅτι ἐπ᾿ ἐμοὶ με- 5
γαλύνεσθε, ἐναλλάσσεσθε δέ μοι ὀνείδει· γνῶτε οὖν ὅτι ὁ Κύριος ἐστιν 6
ὁ ταράξας με, ὀχύρωμα δὲ αὐτοῦ ἐπ᾿ ἐμὲ ὕψωσεν. Ἰδοῦ γελῶ 7
ὀνείδη, καὶ οὐ λαλήσω· κεκράξομαι, καὶ οὐδαμοῦ κρίμα. Κύκλῳ 8
περιωκοδόμημαι, καὶ οὐ μὴ διαβῶ· ἐπὶ δὲ ἀτραποῦς μου σκότος
ἔθετο. Τὴν δόξαν μου ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ ἐξέδυσε, καὶ ἀφεῖλε στέφανον ἀπὸ 9
κεφαλῆς μου· διέσπασε δέ με κύκλῳ, καὶ ᾠχόμην· ἐξέκοψε δὲ ὥσπερ 10
δένδρον τὴν ἐλπίδα μου. Δεινῶς δέ μοι ὀργῇ ἐχρήσατο, ἡγήσατο 11
δέ με ὥσπερ ἐχθρόν· ὁμοθυμαδὸν αὐτοῦ ἦλθε τὰ πειρατήρια ἐπ᾿ 12
ἐμὲ, ταῖς ὁδοῖς μου ἐκύκλωσάν (με) ἐγκάθετοι. Ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ (δὲ) ἀπέστησαν 13

## CHAPTER XVIII.

**7** Let the most meager [of men] hunt his possessions, and let his counsel fail.
**8** Yea, let his foot be cast into a snare, and in a net let him be entangled;
**9** and let snares come upon him (from all sides), and let them prevail against him [as eagerly as] those who thirst.
**10** And his cord is hidden in the earth, and his trap is upon the path all around.
**11** (And) let pangs destroy him; and let many come about his feet amidst a grievous famine, and a terrible fall is prepared for him.
**12** Let the branches of his feet be eaten, and Death shall devour his prime [of life].
**13** And let a wail for healing be raised from his dwelling;
**14** yet let necessity (and) a royal accusation hold him fast, and it shall make its dwelling in his tent,
**15** (and) in his night. His comely things shall be scattered with brimstone;
**16** beneath, his roots shall wither, and above, his harvest shall fall.
**17** Let his memorial perish from the earth, and let no name remain for him upon the face of the outer [world];
**18** (and) let them thrust him forth from light into darkness.
**19** He shall not be known among his people, nor shall his house be preserved beneath the heaven;
**20** but in his [possessions] shall strangers live. Upon him shall the last [generations] sigh; but the first [generations] had wonder.
**21** These are the houses of the unrighteous, and this is the manner of those who know not the Lord.

## CHAPTER XIX.

**1** Then Job answered and said,
**2** How long will ye weary my soul, and humble me with words?
**3** Know ye only, that the Lord it is Who hath done thus unto me; (and) ye speak evil against me, not being ashamed (of me, and) ye press upon me.
**4** Yea verily, I have truly gone astray, and a deceiver maketh his dwelling with me, to speak a word which was not fitting; and my words wander, and are not timely.
**5** But cease ye, for ye magnify yourselves against me, and ye turn against me with reproach.
**6** Know then that the Lord it is Who hath troubled me, and His stronghold hath He raised upon me.
**7** Behold, I scorn [your] reproaches, yet I will not speak; I will cry out, yet there is no judgment.
**8** I have been walled around, and I shall not pass through; and upon my paths hath He set darkness.
**9** He hath stripped my glory from me, and hath taken the crown from my head;
**10** and He hath scattered me all around, and I am perished; and He hath cut off my hope like a tree.
**11** And terribly hath He used wrath against me, and hath deemed me as an enemy.
**12** His trials have come upon me with one accord; [and His] ambushes have surrounded (me) on my paths.
**13** From me (then) have my brethren turned away; they have known strangers rather than me.
