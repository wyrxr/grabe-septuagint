τῆς ἐπισκέψεως τοῦ λαοῦ τῷ Δαυίδ. Καὶ ἦν πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ χίλιαι
χιλιάδες καὶ ἑκατὸν χιλιάδες ἀνδρῶν ἐσπασμένων μάχαιραν· καὶ
Ἰούδας τετρακόσιαι καὶ ἑβδομήκοντα χιλιάδες ἀνδρῶν ἐσπασμέ-
6 νων μάχαιραν. Καὶ τὸν Λευί, καὶ τὸν Βενιαμεὶν οὐκ ἠρίθμησεν
ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῶν, ὅτι προσώχθισεν ὁ λόγος τοῦ βασιλέως τὸν Ἰωάβ.
7 Καὶ πονηρὸν ἐφάνη ἐναντίον τοῦ Θεοῦ περὶ τοῦ πράγματος τού-
8 του, καὶ ἐπάταξε τὸν Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ εἶπε Δαυὶδ πρὸς τὸν Θεόν·
ἡμάρτηκα σφόδρα, ὅτι ἐποίησα τὸ πρᾶγμα τοῦτο· καὶ νῦν περί-
ελε δὴ τὴν κακίαν παιδός σου, ὅτι ἐματαιώθην σφόδρα. Καὶ ἐλά-
9 λησε Κύριος πρὸς Γὰδ ὁρῶντα Δαυίδ, λέγων· πορεύου, καὶ λάλη-
10 σον πρὸς Δαυίδ, λέγων· οὕτως λέγει Κύριος· τρία αἰρῶ ἐγὼ ἐπὶ
11 σέ, καὶ ἐκλέξαι σεαυτῷ ἓν ἐξ αὐτῶν, καὶ ποιήσω σοι. Καὶ ἦλθε
Γὰδ πρὸς Δαυίδ, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· οὕτως λέγει Κύριος· ἔκλεξαι
12 σεαυτῷ, ἢ τρία ἔτη λιμοῦ, ἢ τρεῖς μῆνας φεύγειν σε ἐκ προσώπου
ἐχθρῶν σου, καὶ μάχαιραν ἐχθρῶν σου τοῦ ἐξολοθρεῦσαι, ἢ τρεῖς
ἡμέρας ῥομφαίαν Κυρίου καὶ θάνατον ἐν τῇ γῇ, καὶ ἄγγελος Κυ-
ρίου ἐξολοθρεύων ἐν πάσῃ κληρονομίᾳ Ἰσραήλ· καὶ νῦν ἴδε τί ἀπο-
13 κριθῶ τῷ ἀποστείλαντί με λόγον. Καὶ εἶπε Δαυὶδ πρὸς Γάδ· χαλεπά
μοι καὶ τὰ τρία (ταῦτα) σφόδρα· ἐμπεσοῦμαι δὴ εἰς χεῖρας Κυ-
ρίου, ὅτι πολλοὶ οἱ οἰκτιρμοὶ αὐτοῦ σφόδρα, καὶ εἰς χεῖρας ἀν-
14 θρώπων οὐ μὴ ἐμπέσω. Καὶ ἔδωκε Κύριος θάνατον ἐν Ἰσραήλ,
15 καὶ ἔπεσαν ἐξ Ἰσραὴλ ἑβδομήκοντα χιλιάδες ἀνδρῶν. Καὶ ἀπέστει-
λεν ὁ Θεὸς ἄγγελον εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ τοῦ ἐξολοθρεῦσαι αὐτήν· καὶ
ὡς ἐξωλόθρευεν, εἶδε Κύριος, καὶ μετεμελήθη ἐπὶ τῇ κακίᾳ· καὶ
εἶπε τῷ ἀγγέλῳ τῷ ἐξολοθρεύοντι· ἱκανούσθω σοι, ἄνες τὴν χεῖ-
ρά σου· καὶ ὁ ἄγγελος Κυρίου ἑστὼς ἐν τῷ ἅλῳ Ὀρνὰ τοῦ Ἰεβου-
16 σαίου, καὶ ἐπῆρε Δαυὶδ τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἴδε τὸν ἄγγε-
λον Κυρίου ἑστῶτα ἀναμέσον τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἀναμέσον τοῦ οὐρανοῦ,
καὶ ἡ ῥομφαία αὐτοῦ ἐσπασμένη ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ, ἐκτεταμένη
ἐπὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ· καὶ ἔπεσε Δαυίδ, καὶ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι περιβεβλη-
17 μένοι ἐν σάκκοις ἐπὶ πρόσωπον αὐτῶν. Καὶ εἶπε Δαυὶδ πρὸς τὸν
Θεόν· οὐκ ἐγὼ εἶπα τοῦ ἀριθμῆσαι ἐν τῷ λαῷ; καὶ ἐγὼ εἰμι ὁ
ἁμαρτῶν, κακοποιῶν ἐκακοποίησα, καὶ ταῦτα τὰ πρόβατα τί ἐ-
ποίησαν; Κύριε ὁ Θεός, γενηθήτω ἡ χείρ σου ἐν ἐμοί, καὶ ἐν τῷ
οἴκῳ τοῦ πατρός μου, καὶ μὴ ἐν τῷ λαῷ σου εἰς ἀπώλειαν, Κύριε.
18 Καὶ ἄγγελος Κυρίου τῷ Γὰδ εἶπε τοῦ εἰπεῖν πρὸς Δαυίδ, ἵνα ἀνα-

**5** of the numbering of the people unto David. And all Israel were a thousand thousands and an hundred thousands of men that drew sword; and Judah were four hundred and seventy thousands of men that drew sword.
**6** But Levi and Benjamin he numbered not among them, for the word of the king had displeased Joab.
**7** And the thing appeared evil in the sight of God concerning this matter, and He smote Israel.
**8** Then David said unto God, "I have sinned grievously, for I have done this thing; and now, I pray Thee, take away the iniquity of Thy servant, for I have acted exceeding foolishly."
**9** And the LORD spake unto Gad, David's seer, saying, "Go and speak unto David, saying, 'Thus saith the LORD:
**10** Three things I bring upon thee, and choose thou for thyself one of them, and I will do it unto thee.'"
**11** So Gad came unto David and said unto him, "Thus saith the LORD: 'Choose for thyself,
**12** either three years of famine, or three months that thou flee from before thy foes, and the sword of thine enemies to destroy [thee]; or three days the sword of the LORD and death in the land, and the Angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the inheritance of Israel. And now, see what I shall answer to Him that sent me with a word.'"
**13** And David said unto Gad, "Grievous [are] these [things] unto me exceedingly. I will surely fall into the hands of the LORD, for His mercies are very many; and into the hands of men I will not fall."
**14** So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel, and there fell of Israel seventy thousands of men.
**15** And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it; and as he was destroying, the LORD saw, and He was moved to relent concerning the evil. And He said to the angel that destroyed, "It is enough for thee; stay now thine hand." And the Angel of the LORD stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.
**16** Then David lifted up his eyes and saw the Angel of the LORD standing between the earth and the heaven, and His sword drawn in His hand, stretched forth over Jerusalem. And David fell upon his face, and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, [fell likewise] upon their faces.
**17** And David said unto God, "Was it not I that commanded to number the people? And I it is that have sinned, and have indeed done evil. But these sheep, what have they done? O Lord, my God, let Thy hand, I pray Thee, be against me, and against the house of my father, and not against Thy people unto destruction, O Lord."
**18** Then the Angel of the LORD commanded Gad to speak unto David, that he should go up
