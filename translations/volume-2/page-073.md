ΚΕΦ. Γ΄. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Β΄. 549
λειαν τὴν βασιλείαν ἀπὸ τοῦ οἴκου Σαούλ, καὶ τοῦ ἀναστῆσαι τὸν
θρόνον Δαυὶδ ἐπ᾽ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν Ἰούδαν ἀπὸ Δὰν καὶ ἕως
Βηρσαβεέ. Καὶ οὐκ ἠδυνάσθη ἔτι Ἰσβοσθὲ ἀποκριθῆναι τῷ Ἀβεν- 11
νὴρ ἔρημα, ἀπὸ τοῦ φοβεῖσθαι αὐτόν. Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ἀβεννὴρ 12
ἀγγέλους πρὸς Δαυὶδ εἰς Θηλὰμ οὗ γ᾽ ἦν, παραχρῆμα, λέγων,
διάθου διαθήκην σου μετ᾽ ἐμοῦ. καὶ ἰδοὺ ἡ χεὶρ μου μετὰ σοῦ τοῦ
ἐπιστρέψαι ἐπὶ σὲ πάντα τὸν οἶκον Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ εἶπε Δαυίδ· κα- 13
λῶς· ἐγὼ διαθήσομαι πρὸς σὲ διαθήκην, πλὴν λόγον ἕνα ἐγὼ αἰ-
τοῦμαι παρὰ σοῦ, λέγων· οὐκ ὄψῃ τὸ πρόσωπόν μου, ἐὰν μὴ ἀ-
γάγῃς τὴν Μελχὰλ θυγατέρα Σαούλ, παραγινομένου σου ἰδεῖν τὸ
πρόσωπόν μου. Καὶ ἀπέστειλε Δαυὶδ ἀγγέλους πρὸς Ἰσβοσθὲ υἱ- 14
ὸν Σαούλ, λέγων· ἀπόδος μοι τὴν γυναῖκά μου τὴν Μελχάλ, ἣν
ἔλαβον ἐμαυτῷ ἐν ἑκατὸν ἀκροβυστίαις ἀλλοφύλων. Καὶ ἀπέστει- 15
λεν Ἰσβοσθέ, καὶ ἔλαβεν αὐτὴν παρὰ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς αὐτῆς, παρὰ Φαλ-
τιὴλ υἱοῦ Λαείς. Καὶ ἐπορεύετο (σὺν αὐτῇ) ὁ ἀνὴρ αὐτῆς μετ᾽ 16
αὐτῆς κλαίων ὀπίσω αὐτῆς ἕως Βαουρείμ. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτὸν
Ἀβεννήρ· πορεύου, ἀνάστρεφε· καὶ ἀνέστρεψε. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἀβεν- 17
νὴρ πρὸς τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους Ἰσραήλ, λέγων· ἐχθὲς καὶ τρίτην
ἐζητεῖτε τὸν Δαυὶδ βασιλεύειν ἐφ᾽ ὑμῶν. Καὶ νῦν ποιήσατε, ὅ,τι 18·
Κύριος ἐλάλησε περὶ Δαυὶδ λέγων· ἐν χειρὶ Δαυὶδ τοῦ δούλου
μου σώσω τὸν Ἰσραὴλ ἐκ χειρὸς ἀλλοφύλων, καὶ ἐκ χειρὸς πάν-
των τῶν ἐχθρῶν αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐλάλησεν Ἀβεννὴρ καί γε ἐν τοῖς 19
ὦσι Βενιαμείν, καὶ ἐπορεύθη Ἀβεννὴρ τοῦ λαλῆσαι εἰς τὰ ὦτα
Δαυὶδ εἰς Χεβρὼν πάντα ὅσα ἤρεσεν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ
ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς παντὸς οἴκου Βενιαμείν. Καὶ ἦλθεν Ἀβεννὴρ πρὸς 20
Δαυὶδ εἰς Χεβρών, καὶ μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ εἴκοσιν ἄνδρες· καὶ ἐποίησε
Δαυὶδ τῷ Ἀβεννήρ, καὶ τοῖς ἀνδράσι τοῖς μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ πότον. Καὶ 21
εἶπεν Ἀβεννὴρ πρὸς Δαυίδ· ἀναστήσομαι δή, καὶ πορεύσομαι, καὶ
συναθροίσω πρὸς τὸν κύριόν μου τὸν βασιλέα πάντα τὸν Ἰσραήλ,
καὶ διαθήσομαι μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ διαθήκην, καὶ βασιλεύσεις ἐπὶ πᾶσιν
οἷς ἐπιθυμεῖ ἡ ψυχή σου. Καὶ ἀπέστειλε Δαυὶδ τὸν Ἀβεννήρ, καὶ
ἐπορεύθη ἐν εἰρήνῃ. Καὶ ἰδοὺ οἱ παῖδες Δαυὶδ καὶ Ἰωὰβ παρεγένοντο 22
ἐκ τῆς ἐξοδίας, καὶ σκῦλα πολλὰ μεθ᾽ αὑτῶν ἔφερον. Καὶ Ἀβεν-
νὴρ οὐκ ἦν μετὰ Δαυὶδ ἐν Χεβρών, ὅτι ἀπεστάλκει αὐτὸν καὶ ἀ-
πεληλύθει ἐν εἰρήνῃ. Καὶ Ἰωὰβ καὶ πᾶσα ἡ στρατιὰ αὐτοῦ ἦλ- 23
θασαν, καὶ ἀπηγγέλη τῷ Ἰωάβ, λέγοντες· ἥκει Ἀβεννὴρ υἱὸς Νὴρ

**10** —[to take away] the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to raise up the throne of David over Israel, and over Judah, from Dan even unto Beersheba.

**11** And Ishbosheth could not answer Abner [a] word any more, because he feared him.

**12** Then Abner sent messengers unto David to Thelam, where he was, forthwith, saying, "Make thy covenant with me, and behold, my hand [shall be] with thee, to bring all the house of Israel back unto thee."

**13** And David said, "Well; I will make a covenant with thee, save that one thing I require of thee, saying: Thou shalt not see my face, except thou bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when thou comest to behold my face."

**14** And David sent messengers unto Ishbosheth, Saul's son, saying, "Restore unto me Michal my wife, whom I took for myself with a hundred foreskins of the Philistines."

**15** And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, from Phaltiel the son of Laish.

**16** And her husband went (with her) with her, weeping behind her, until Baal-Hebron. And Abner said unto him, "Go, return." And he returned.

**17** And Abner spake unto the elders of Israel, saying, "In time past ye sought for David to reign over you.

**18** And now do ye that which the Lord spake concerning David, saying, 'By the hand of David my servant will I save Israel from the hand of the Philistines, and from the hand of all their enemies.'"

**19** And Abner spake even into the ears of Benjamin; and Abner went to speak into the ears of David in Hebron all that was pleasing in the eyes of Israel, and in the eyes of all the house of Benjamin.

**20** So Abner came to David in Hebron, and with him twenty men. And David made for Abner, and for the men that were with him, a feast.

**21** And Abner said unto David, "I will arise now, and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, and I will make a covenant with him, and thou shalt reign over all that thy soul desireth." And David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.

**22** And behold, the young men of David and Joab came from the expedition, and brought many spoils with them. But Abner was not with David in Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he had departed in peace.

**23** And Joab and all his army were come, and it was told Joab, saying, "Abner the son of Ner is come"
