624 ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Γ΄. ΚΕΦ. Θ΄. Ι΄.
γῆ, οὓς οὐκ ἠδύναντο οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐξολοθρεῦσαι αὐτούς· καὶ
ἀνήγαγεν αὐτοὺς Σαλωμὼν εἰς φόρον δουλείας ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας
22 ταύτης. Καὶ ἐκ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ οὐκ ἔδωκε Σαλωμὼν εἰς πράγ-
ματα, ὅτι αὐτοὶ ἦσαν ἄνδρες πολεμισταί, καὶ παῖδες αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἄρ-
χοντες αὐτοῦ, καὶ τρισσοὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἄρχοντες αὐτοῦ τῶν ἁρμά-
23 των, καὶ ἱππεῖς αὐτοῦ. Οὗτοι οἱ ἄρχοντες οἱ ἐστηλωμένοι οἱ
ἐπὶ τοῦ ἔργου τοῦ Σαλωμών, πεντήκοντα καὶ πεντακόσιοι, ἐπικρα-
24 τοῦντες ἐν τῷ λαῷ, οἱ ποιοῦντες ἐν τῷ ἔργῳ. Πλὴν θυγάτηρ
Φαραὼ ἀνέβη ἐκ πόλεως Δαυὶδ πρὸς οἶκον αὐτῆς, ὃν ᾠκοδόμη-
25 σε σὺν τὴν Μελώ. Καὶ ἀνεβίβασε Σαλωμὼν τρεῖς καθόδους ἐν
τῷ ἐνιαυτῷ ὁλοκαύτωμα, καὶ εἰρηνικὰς ἐπὶ τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου ὃ ᾠ-
κοδόμησε τῷ Κυρίῳ, καὶ ἐθυμία αὐτὸς εἰς πρόσωπον Κυρίου· καὶ
26 ἀπήρτισε σὺν τὸν οἶκον. Καὶ ναῦν ὑπὲρ οὗ ἐποίησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς
Σαλωμὼν ἐν Γασίων Γαβέρ, τὴν οὖσαν ἐχομένην Αἰλάθ, ἐπὶ τοῦ
27 χείλους τῆς ἐσχάτης θαλάσσης, ἐν γῇ Ἐδώμ. Καὶ ἀπέστειλε
Χειρὰμ ἐν τῇ νηῒ τῶν παίδων αὐτοῦ ἄνδρας ναυτικοὺς ἐλαύνειν
28 εἰδότας θάλασσαν μετὰ τῶν παίδων Σαλωμών. Καὶ ἦλθον εἰς
Σωφαρά, καὶ ἔλαβον ἐκεῖθεν χρυσίου τετρακόσια καὶ εἴκοσι τάλαν-
τα, καὶ ἤνεγκαν τῷ βασιλεῖ Σαλωμών.

ΚΕΦ. Ι΄.

1 ΚΑΙ βασίλισσα Σαβὰ ἤκουσε τὸ ὄνομα Σαλωμῶν, καὶ τὸ ὄ-
2 νομα Κυρίου, καὶ ἦλθε πειράσαι αὐτὸν ἐν αἰνίγμασι. Καὶ ἦλθεν εἰς
Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐν δυνάμει βαρείᾳ σφόδρα· καὶ κάμηλοι αἴρουσαι
ἡδύσματα, καὶ χρυσὸν πολὺν σφόδρα, καὶ λίθον τίμιον· καὶ εἰ-
σῆλθε πρὸς Σαλωμών, καὶ ἐλάλησεν αὐτῷ πάντα ὅσα ἦν ἐν τῇ
3 καρδίᾳ αὐτῆς. Καὶ ἀπήγγειλεν αὐτῇ Σαλωμὼν πάντας τοὺς λό-
γους αὐτῆς· οὐκ ἦν λόγος παρεωραμένος ὑπὸ τοῦ βασιλέως, ὃν
4 οὐκ ἀπήγγειλεν αὐτῇ. Καὶ εἶδε βασίλισσα Σαβὰ πᾶσαν φρόνησιν
5 Σαλωμῶν, καὶ τὸν οἶκον ὃν ᾠκοδόμησε. Καὶ τὰ βρώματα Σα-
λωμῶν, καὶ τὴν καθέδραν τῶν παίδων αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὴν στάσιν λει-
τουργῶν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὸν ἱματισμὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοὺς οἰνοχόους αὐ-
τοῦ, καὶ τὴν ὁλοκαύτωσιν αὐτοῦ ἣν ἀνέφερεν ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου· καὶ
6 ἐξ ἑαυτῆς ἐγένετο. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Σαλωμῶν· Ἀ-
ληθινὸς ὁ λόγος ὃν ἤκουσα ἐν τῇ γῇ μου, περὶ τοῦ λόγου σου καὶ

#### CHAPTER 9

**21** ...their children who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel were not able to utterly destroy, even them did Solomon levy for a tribute of bond-service unto this day.
**22** But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen [for these tasks]; for they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.
**23** These were the chief officers appointed over Solomon’s work, five hundred and fifty, who ruled over the people, overseeing the work.
**24** Now Pharaoh’s daughter went up out of the city of David unto her own house, which he had built, together with Millo.
**25** And three times in a year did Solomon offer whole burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he had built unto the Lord. And he himself burned incense before the face of the Lord; and so he completed the House.
**26** And King Solomon built a fleet of ships in Gasion Gaber, which is beside Ailath, upon the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.
**27** And Hiram sent in the fleet his servants, even shipmen who had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.
**28** And they came to Sophara, and took thence four hundred and twenty talents of gold, and brought [it] to King Solomon.

#### CHAPTER 10

**1** Now when the Queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, and the name of the Lord, she came to test him with hard questions.
**2** And she came to Jerusalem with a very great retinue, with camels bearing spices, and very much gold, and precious stones. And when she came to Solomon, she spoke with him of all that was in her heart.
**3** And Solomon declared unto her all her matters; there was no matter hid from the king which he told her not.
**4** And when the Queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,
**5** And his food, and the seating of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his own burnt offering which he offered up in the House of the Lord, there was no more spirit in her.
**6** And she said unto King Solomon, "It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom."
