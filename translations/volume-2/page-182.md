43. Ζουβᾶ, θυγάτηρ Σαλαΐ. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἐν πάσῃ ὁδῷ Ἀσὰ τοῦ πα-
    τρὸς αὐτοῦ, οὐκ ἐξέκλινεν ἀπ᾽ αὐτῆς τοῦ ποιῆσαι τὸ εὐθὲς ἐνώπιον
    Κυρίου· πλὴν τῶν ὑψηλῶν οὐκ ἐξῆρεν· ἔτι δ᾽ ὁ λαὸς ἐθυσίαζε, καὶ
44. ἐθυμίων ἐν τοῖς ὑψηλοῖς. Καὶ εἰρήνευσεν Ἰωσαφὰτ μετὰ βασιλέως
45. Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Ἰωσαφάτ, καὶ αἱ δυναστεῖαι
    αὐτοῦ, ὅσα ἐποίησε, καὶ ὅσα ἐπολέμησεν, οὐχὶ ταῦτα γεγραμμένα
    ἐν βιβλίῳ λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν τῶν βασιλέων Ἰούδα;
46. Καὶ περισσὸν τοῦ ἐνδιηλλαγμένου δ᾽ ὑπελείφθη ἐν ἡμέραις Ἀσὰ πατρὸς
    αὐτοῦ, ἐπέλεξεν ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς.
47. Καὶ βασιλεὺς οὐκ ἦν ἐν Ἐδώμ ἐστηλωμένος.
48. Καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἰωσαφὰτ ἐποίησε νῆας Θαρσεῖς,
    τοῦ πορευθῆναι Ὠφειρὰ εἰς χρυσίον, καὶ οὐκ ἐπορεύθησαν, ὅτι συ-
49. νετρίβησαν νῆες ἐν Ἀσεὼν Γαβέρ. Τότε εἶπεν Ὀχοζίας υἱὸς Ἀ-
    χαὰβ πρὸς Ἰωσαφάτ· πορευθήτωσαν δοῦλοί μου μετὰ τῶν δούλων
50. σου ἐν ταῖς ναυσίν· καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησεν Ἰωσαφάτ. Καὶ ἐκοιμήθη
    Ἰωσαφὰτ μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐτάφη παρὰ τοῖς πατρά-
    σιν αὐτοῦ ἐν πόλει Δαυὶδ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Ἰωρὰμ
51. υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀντ᾽ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ Ὀχοζίας υἱὸς Ἀχαὰβ ἐβασίλευσεν ἐπὶ
    Ἰσραὴλ ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ ἐν ἔτει ἑπτακαιδεκάτῳ Ἰωσαφὰτ βασιλέως
52. Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ἰσραὴλ δύο ἔτη, Καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ πο-
    νηρὸν ἐνώπιον Κυρίου, καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἐν ὁδῷ Ἀχαὰβ τοῦ πατρὸς
    αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐν ὁδῷ Ἰεζάβελ τῆς μητρὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἁμαρ-
53. τίαις Ἱεροβοὰμ υἱοῦ Ναβάτ, ὃς ἐξήμαρτε τὸν Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἐδού-
    λευσε τοῖς Βααλεῖμ, καὶ προσεκύνησεν αὐτοῖς, καὶ παρώργισε τὸν
    Κύριον Θεὸν Ἰσραήλ, κατὰ πάντα τὰ γενόμενα ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ.

**Chapter 22**
**(continued)**

**43** Zubâ, the daughter of Salaï. And he walked in all the way of Asa his father, nor turned aside from it, to do that which was right in the sight of the Lord. Howbeit, the high places were not removed; the people still did sacrifice and burn incense in the high places.
**44** And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.
**45** Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his mighty deeds, all that he did, and all that he warred, are not these things written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Judah?
**46** Moreover, the remnant of those who had perverted themselves, which remained in the days of Asa his father, he took away out of the land.
**47** And there was no king established in Edom.
**48** And King Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish, to go to Ophir for gold; but they went not, for the ships were broken at Ezion-Geber.
**49** Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, "Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships." But Jehoshaphat would not.
**50** And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David, his father; and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.
**51** And Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat, King of Judah, and he reigned over Israel two years.
**52** And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the way of Ahab his father, and in the way of Jezebel his mother, and in the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
**53** And he served the Baalim and worshipped them, and provoked to anger the Lord God of Israel, according to all the things that had been done before him.
