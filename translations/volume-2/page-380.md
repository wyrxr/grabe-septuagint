1 ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο καθὼς ἠκούσθη τῷ Σαναβαλλάτ, καὶ Τωβία, καὶ
    τῷ Γησὰμ τῷ Ἄραβι, καὶ τοῖς καταλοίποις τῶν ἐχθρῶν ἡμῶν,
    ὅτι ᾠκοδόμησα τὸ τεῖχος, καὶ οὐ κατελείφθη ἐν αὐτοῖς πνοή· καὶ
    γε ἕως τοῦ καιροῦ ἐκείνου θύρας οὐκ ἀπέστησα ἐν ταῖς πύλαις.
2 Καὶ ἀπέστειλε Σαναβαλλὰτ καὶ Γησὰμ πρὸς μέ, λέγων· δεῦρο,
    καὶ συναχθῶμεν ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ ἐν ταῖς κώμαις ἐν πεδίῳ Ὠνώ· καὶ
3 αὐτοὶ λογιζόμενοί μοι ποιῆσαι πονηρίαν. Καὶ ἀπέστειλα ἐπ᾿ αὐ-
    τοὺς ἀγγέλους, λέγων· ἔργον μέγα ἐγὼ ποιῶ, καὶ οὐ δυνήσομαι
    καταβῆναι, μή ποτε καταπαύσῃ τὸ ἔργον· ὡς ἂν τελειώσω αὐτό,
    καταβήσομαι πρὸς ὑμᾶς.
4 Καὶ ἀπέστειλαν πρὸς μὲ ὡς τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο· καὶ ἀπέστειλα αὐτοῖς κατὰ ταῦτα.
5 Καὶ ἀπέστειλε πρὸς μὲ Σαναβαλλὰτ τὸν παῖδα ἑαυτοῦ, καὶ ἐπιστολὴν ἀνεῳγμένην ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ.
6 Καὶ ἦν γεγραμμένον ἐν αὐτῇ· ἐν ἔθνεσιν ἠκούσθη ὅτι σὺ καὶ οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι λογίζεσθε ἀποστατῆσαι, διὰ τοῦτο σὺ οἰκο-
7 δομεῖς τὸ τεῖχος, καὶ σὺ γίνῃ αὐτοῖς εἰς βασιλέα. Καὶ πρὸς
    τούτοις προφήτας ἔστησας σεαυτῷ, ἵνα καθίσῃς ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ εἰς
    βασιλέα ἐν Ἰούδα· καὶ νῦν ἐπαγγελήσονται τῷ βασιλεῖ οἱ λόγοι
8 οὗτοι· καὶ νῦν δεῦρο βουλευσώμεθα ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ. Καὶ ἀπέστειλα πρὸς
    αὐτόν, λέγων· οὐκ ἐγενήθη ὡς οἱ λόγοι οὗτοι ὡς σὺ λέγεις, ὅτι
9 ἀπὸ καρδίας σου σὺ ψεύδῃ αὐτούς. Ὅτι πάντες φοβερίζουσιν ἡμᾶς,
    λέγοντες· ἐκλυθήσονται αἱ χεῖρες αὐτῶν ἀπὸ τοῦ ἔργου τούτου,
10 καὶ οὐ ποιηθήσεται· καὶ νῦν ἐκραταίωσα τὰς χεῖράς μου. Κἀγὼ
    εἰσῆλθον εἰς οἶκον Σεμεΐ υἱοῦ Δαλαία, υἱοῦ Μεηταβεήλ, καὶ αὐτὸς
    συνεχόμενος, καὶ εἶπε· συναχθῶμεν εἰς οἶκον τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐν μέσῳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ κλείσωμεν τὰς θύρας αὐτοῦ, ὅτι ἔρχονται νυκτὸς φονεῦσαί σε.
11 Καὶ εἶπον· τίς ἐστιν ὁ ἀνὴρ οἷος ἐγώ, φεύξεται; ἢ τίς
    οἷος ἐγώ, ὃς εἰσελεύσεται εἰς τὸν οἶκον, καὶ ζήσεται;
12 Καὶ ἐπέγνων, καὶ ἰδοὺ ὁ Θεὸς οὐκ ἀπέστειλεν αὐτόν, ὅτι ἡ προφητεία
    λόγος κατ᾿ ἐμοῦ. καὶ Τωβίας καὶ Σαναβαλλὰτ ἐμισθώσαντο ἐπ᾿
13 ἐμὲ ὄχλον, ὅπως φοβηθῶ, καὶ ποιήσω οὕτως, καὶ ἁμάρτω, καὶ
    γένωμαι αὐτοῖς εἰς ὄνομα πονηρόν, ὅπως ἀνειδίσωσί με.
14 Μνήσθητι ὁ Θεός μου, τῷ Τωβία καὶ τῷ Σαναβαλλάτ, ὡς τὰ ποιήματα αὐτοῦ ταῦτα, καὶ τῷ Νωαδίᾳ τῷ προφήτῃ, καὶ τοῖς καταλοίποις

#### CHAPTER VI.

<sup>1</sup> And it came to pass, when it was heard by Sanballat, and Tobiah, and by Geshem the Arabian, and by the rest of our enemies, that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; and indeed, even unto that time, I had not yet set up the doors in the gates.

<sup>2</sup> Then Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, "Come thou, and let us meet together in the villages in the plain of Ono."

<sup>3</sup> But they had purposed to do me mischief. And I sent messengers unto them, saying, "I do a great work, and I cannot come down; lest the work cease, should I descend. As soon as I shall finish it, then will I come down unto you."

<sup>4</sup> And they sent unto me according to this word; and I sent unto them after the same manner.

<sup>5</sup> Then Sanballat sent his servant unto me, and in his hand was an open letter.

<sup>6</sup> And it was written therein: "Among the nations hath it been heard, that thou and the Jews do plot to revolt; and for this cause thou buildest

<sup>7</sup> the wall, and thou art become their king. And moreover, thou hast appointed prophets to thyself, that thou mightest be king in Jerusalem, [even] king in Judah; and now these words shall be reported unto the king.

<sup>8</sup> Come now therefore, and let us counsel together." Then I sent unto him, saying, "There hath been no such thing done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart."

<sup>9</sup> For they all endeavored to make us afraid, saying, "Their hands shall be weakened from this work,

<sup>10</sup> and it shall not be accomplished." And now, I strengthened my hands. And I went into the house of Shemei the son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabeel, and he, being constrained, said, "Let us assemble into the house of God, even into the midst thereof, and let us shut the doors thereof, for they come by night to slay thee."

<sup>11</sup> And I said, "Who is a man such as I, that would flee? Or who is there such as I, who would enter into the [holy] House, and live [thereby]?"

<sup>12</sup> And I perceived, and behold, God had not sent him; for the prophecy was a word against me. And Tobiah and Sanballat had hired a mob against me,

<sup>13</sup> that I should be afraid, and do thus, and sin, and become unto them an evil name, that they might reproach me.

<sup>14</sup> Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their deeds, and Noadiah the prophet, and the rest [of the prophets].
