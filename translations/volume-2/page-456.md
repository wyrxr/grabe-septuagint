7 πείνασον, ὑπερήφανον δὲ σβέσον· στῆψον δὲ ἀσεβεῖς παραχρῆμα,
8 κρύψον δὲ αὐτοὺς εἰς γῆν (ἔξω) ὁμοθυμαδόν, τὰ δὲ πρόσωπα
9 αὐτῶν ἀτιμίας ἔμπλησον· ὁμολογήσω ἄρα ὅτι δύναταί σου ἡ δε-
10 ξιὰ σῶσαί σε. Ἀλλ᾽ ἰδοὺ, παρὰ σοὶ θηρία ἴσα βουσὶν χόρτον ἐσθίει·
11 ἰδοὺ δὴ ἡ ἰσχὺς αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ ὀσφύος αὐτοῦ, ἡ δὲ δύναμις αὐτοῦ ἐπ᾽
12 ὀμφαλοῦ γαστρὸς αὐτοῦ· ἔστησεν οὐρὰν αὐτοῦ ὥσπερ κυπάρισσον,
13 τὰ δὲ νεῦρα αὐτοῦ (ὥσπερ σχοινία) συμπέπλεκται. Αἱ πλευραὶ αὐ-
14 τοῦ ὡς πέτραι χαλκαῖ, ἡ δὲ ῥάχις αὐτοῦ ὡς τύχος σιδήρεος.
15 Τοῦτό ἐστιν ἀρχὴ πλάσματος Κυρίου, πεποιημένον εἰς τὸ ἐγκα-
    ταπαίζεσθαι ὑπὸ τῶν ἀγγέλων αὐτοῦ. Ἐπελθὼν δὲ ἐπ᾽ ὄρος ἀκρό-
16 τομον, ἐποίησε χαρμονὴν τετράποσιν ἐν τῷ ἀγρῷ. Ὑπὸ παντο-
    δαπὰ δένδρα κοιμᾶται, παρὰ κάλαμον καὶ πάπυρον καὶ βούτομον·
17 σκιάζονται δὲ αὐτῷ δένδρα μεγάλα σὺν ῥαδάμνοις, καὶ κλῶνες
18 ἄγνου. Ἐὰν γένηται πλημμύρα, οὐ μὴ αἰσθήται, πέποιθεν ὅτε
19 προσκρούσει ὁ Ἰορδάνης εἰς τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ· ἐν τῷ ὀφθαλμῷ
20.21 αὐτοῦ δέχεται αὐτόν, ἐνσκολιευόμενος τρήσεις ῥῖνα (αὐτοῦ). Ἄξεις
    δὲ δράκοντα ἐν ἀγγίστρῳ; περιθήσεις δὲ φορβαίαν περὶ ῥῖνα αὐ-
    τοῦ; (καὶ) εἰ εἱλήσεις χλοιὸν ἐν τῷ μυκτῆρι αὐτοῦ; ψελλίῳ δὲ
22 τρυπήσεις τὸ χεῖλος αὐτοῦ; λαλήσει δέ σοι δεήσεις καὶ ἱκετηρίας
23 μαλακῶς; θήσεται δὲ μετὰ σοῦ διαθήκην; λήψῃ δὲ αὐτὸν δοῦ-
24 λον αἰώνιον; καὶ ἐμπαίζεις αὐτῷ ὥσπερ ὀρνέῳ; θήσεις δὲ αὐ-
25 τὸν ὥσπερ στρουθίον παιδίῳ; ἐνσιτοῦνται δὲ ἐν αὐτῷ ἔθνη, καὶ
26 μεριτεύονται αὐτὸν φοινίκων γένη; πᾶν δὲ πλωτὸν συνελθὸν οὐ
    μὴ ἐνέγκῃ (μίαν) βύρσαν οὐρᾶς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐν πλοίοις ἁλιέων κε-
27 φαλὴν αὐτοῦ. Ἐπιθήσεις δὲ ἐπ᾽ αὐτῷ χεῖρα, μνησθεὶς πολέμου
28 τοῦ γιγνομένου ἐν τῷ σώματι αὐτοῦ; καὶ μηκέτι γινέσθω οὐχ
    ἑώρακας αὐτὸν, οὐδὲ ἐπὶ τοῖς λεγομένοις τεθαύμακας;

1 Οὐ δέδοικας (αὐτὸν), ὅτι ἡτοίμασταί μοι; τίς γάρ ἐστιν ὁ

4 δι᾽ αὐτὸν, καὶ λόγος δυνάμεων ἐλεήσει τὸν ἴσον αὐτοῦ. Τίς (δὲ)
    ἀνακαλύψει πρόσωπον ἐνδύσεως αὐτοῦ; εἰς δὲ πτύξιν θώρακος αὐ-

## CHAPTER XL.

**7** Cause thou to hunger, and quench the proud; and humble the impious straightway.
**8** And hide them, [yea, even] outside, unitedly in the earth, and fill their faces with dishonor.
**9** Then will I confess that thy right hand is able to save thee.
**10** But behold! with thee do beasts, like unto cattle, eat grass.
**11** Behold, his strength is upon his loins, and his power is upon the navel of his belly.
**12** He hath set his tail like a cypress tree;
**13** And his sinews (as it were, ropes) are intertwined.
**14** His ribs are like brazen stones, and his backbone is like a rampart of iron.
**15** This is the beginning of the Lord's creation, made to be mocked by His angels. When he goeth forth upon a steep mountain, he hath made gladness for the four-footed beasts in the field.
**16** Under various trees he slumbereth, beside the reed and the papyrus and the bulrush;
**17** And great trees with willows do overshadow him, and branches of the chaste tree.
**18** If a flood should occur, he will not perceive it; he is confident when the Jordan shall rush into his mouth.
**19** In his eye he receiveth it;
**20** [And,] twisting, wilt thou pierce his nose? Wilt thou lead a dragon with a hook?
**21** And wilt thou put a muzzle about his nose? And if thou wilt coil a rope in his nostril? And with a ring wilt thou bore his lip?
**22** Will he speak unto thee supplications and entreaties gently?
**23** And will he make a covenant with thee? Wilt thou take him as an eternal servant?
**24** And dost thou play with him as with a bird? And wilt thou set him as a sparrow for a child?
**25** And do nations feed upon him? And do races of Phoenicians divide him?
**26** Yea, every sailing vessel, gathering together, shall not bring [even one] hide of his tail, nor his head in fishing boats.
**27** And wilt thou lay thy hand upon him, having remembered the battle that doth occur in his body?
**28** And let it no longer happen [that thou attempt this]! Hast thou not seen him, nor wondered at the things spoken concerning him?

## CHAPTER XLI.

**1** Hast thou not feared him, because he hath been prepared for Me? For who is he that resisteth Me?
**2** Or who is he that will stand against Me and remain?
**3** Is not all that is under heaven Mine? I will not be silent concerning him;
**4** And a word of [My] powers shall pity his like. And who will uncover the face of his covering? And into the fold of his breastplate, who would enter?
**5** And who will open the gates of his face?
