Κυρίου, καὶ τοὺς θησαυροὺς τοὺς ἐν οἴκῳ τοῦ βασιλέως, τὰ πάντα
ἔλαβε· καὶ ἔλαβε τοὺς θυρεοὺς τοὺς χρυσοῦς οὓς ἐποίησε Σαλωμῶν.
¹⁰ Καὶ ἐποίησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ῥοβοὰμ θυρεοὺς χαλκοῦς ἀντ᾿ αὐτῶν·
καὶ κατέστησεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν Σουσακεὶμ ἄρχοντας παρατρεχόντων,
τοὺς φυλάσσοντας τὸν πυλῶνα τοῦ βασιλέως.
¹¹ Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ εἰσελθεῖν τὸν βασιλέα εἰς οἶκον Κυρίου,
εἰσεπορεύοντο οἱ φυλάσσοντες, καὶ οἱ παρατρέχοντες,
καὶ οἱ ἐπιστρέφοντες εἰς ἀπάντησιν τῶν παρατρεχόντων.
¹² Καὶ ἐν τῷ ἐντραπῆναι αὐτὸν, ἀπεστράφη ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἡ ὀργὴ Κυρίου,
καὶ οὐκ εἰς καταφθοράν εἰς τέλος·
καὶ γὰρ ἐν τῷ Ἰούδα ἦσαν λόγοι ἀγαθοί, καὶ ἀρεστοὶ ἐν πᾶσι.
¹³ Καὶ κατίσχυσεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ῥοβοὰμ ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν·
καὶ τεσσαράκοντα καὶ ἑνὸς ἐτῶν Ῥοβοὰμ ἐν τῷ βασιλεῦσαι αὐτὸν,
καὶ ἑπτακαίδεκα ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ,
ἐν τῇ πόλει ᾗ ἐξελέξατο Κύριος ἐπονομάσαι τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ ἐκεῖ
ἐκ πασῶν φυλῶν Ἰσραήλ·
καὶ ὄνομα τῆς μητρὸς αὐτοῦ Νοομμὰ ἡ Ἀμμανῖτις.
¹⁴ Καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ πονηρὸν, ὅτι οὐ κατεύθυνε τὴν καρδίαν ἑαυτοῦ
ἐκζητῆσαι τὸν Κύριον.
¹⁵ Καὶ λόγοι Ῥοβοὰμ οἱ πρῶτοι καὶ οἱ ἔσχατοι,
οὐκ ἰδοὺ γεγραμμένοι ἐν τοῖς λόγοις Σαμαία τοῦ προφήτου,
καὶ Ἀδδὼ τοῦ ὁρῶντος, καὶ αἱ πράξεις αὐτοῦ;
καὶ ἐπολέμει Ῥοβοὰμ πρὸς Ἱεροβοὰμ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας.
¹⁶ Καὶ ἀπέθανε Ῥοβοὰμ, καὶ ἐτάφη μετὰ τῶν πατέρων ἑαυτοῦ
ἐν πόλει Δαυΐδ, καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Ἀβιὰ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ.

**ΚΕΦ. ΙΓ΄. ΧΙΙΙ.**

¹ Ἐν τῷ ὀκτωκαιδεκάτῳ ἔτει τῆς βασιλείας Ἱεροβοὰμ ἐβασίλευσεν
Ἀβιὰ ἐπὶ Ἰούδαν.
² Τρία ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ,
καὶ ὄνομα τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ Μααχὰ, θυγάτηρ Οὐριὴλ ἀπὸ Γαβαών.
³ Καὶ πόλεμος ἦν ἀναμέσον Ἀβιὰ, καὶ ἀναμέσον Ἱεροβοάμ.
Καὶ παρετάξατο Ἀβιὰ τὸν πόλεμον ἐν δυνάμει, πολεμικῆς δυνάμεως,
τετρακοσίαις χιλιάσιν ἀνδρῶν δυνατῶν.
Καὶ Ἱεροβοὰμ παρετάξατο πρὸς αὐτὸν πόλεμον ἐν ὀκτακοσίαις
χιλιάσιν δυνατῶν, πολεμικῶν δυνάμεως.
⁴ Καὶ ἀνέστη Ἀβιὰ ἀπὸ τοῦ ὄρους Σομόρων, ὅ ἐστιν ἐν τῷ ὄρει Ἐφραΐμ,
καὶ εἶπεν· ἀκούσατε Ἱεροβοὰμ καὶ πᾶς Ἰσραήλ·
οὐχ ὑμῖν γνῶναι ὅτι Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραὴλ δέδωκε βασιλείαν
ἐπὶ τὸν Ἰσραὴλ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τῷ Δαυΐδ, καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ

**Chapter 12**

...[even] the Lord, and the treasures that were in the king's house; all these he took. He took also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
¹⁰ And King Rehoboam made shields of bronze in their stead. And Shishak appointed over him [Rehoboam] chiefs of the runners, even those who guarded the king's gate.
¹¹ And it came to pass, when the king entered the house of the Lord, that the guards went in, and the runners, and those who returned to meet the runners.
¹² And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the Lord turned from him, and not to destruction utterly; for indeed, in Judah were there good words, and acceptable in all things.
¹³ And King Rehoboam grew strong in Jerusalem, and he reigned. And Rehoboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign; and seventeen years he reigned in Jerusalem, in the city which the Lord had chosen to place His Name there, from all the tribes of Israel. And the name of his mother was Naamah, the Ammonitess.
¹⁴ And he did evil, for he did not prepare his heart to seek the Lord.
¹⁵ Now the acts of Rehoboam, the first and the last, are they not written in the words of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer, and his deeds? And Rehoboam warred against Jeroboam all his days.
¹⁶ And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David. And Abijah his son reigned in his stead.

**Chapter 13**

¹ Now in the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, Abijah began to reign over Judah.
² Three years he reigned in Jerusalem. And the name of his mother was Maacah, the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah.
³ And war there was between Abijah and Jeroboam. And Abijah drew up [his] battle-line with a host, [even] a power of war, four hundred thousand mighty men. And Jeroboam drew up [his] battle-line against him with eight hundred thousand mighty men, [and] of military power.
⁴ And Abijah stood up upon Mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, and he said, "Hearken, Jeroboam, and all Israel! Do ye not know that the Lord, the God of Israel, hath given the kingdom over Israel to David, and to his sons, forever,
