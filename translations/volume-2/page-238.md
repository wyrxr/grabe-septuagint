ἄρχοντος τῆς δυνάμεως τὸν ἐκτάσσοντα τὸν λαὸν τῆς γῆς, καὶ
ἑξήκοντα ἄνδρας τοῦ λαοῦ τῆς γῆς, τοὺς εὑρεθέντας ἐν τῇ πό-
20 λει. Καὶ ἔλαβεν αὐτοὺς Ναβουζαρδὰν ὁ ἀρχιμάγειρος, καὶ ἀ-
21 πήγαγεν αὐτοὺς πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Βαβυλῶνος εἰς Δεβλαθά. Καὶ
ἔπαισεν αὐτοὺς βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος, καὶ ἐθανάτωσεν αὐτοὺς
ἐν Δεβλαθὰ ἐν γῇ Αἰμάθ, καὶ ἀπῳκίσθη Ἰούδας ἐπάνωθεν τῆς
22 γῆς αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ὁ λαὸς ὁ καταλειφθεὶς ἐν γῇ Ἰούδα, οὓς κα-
τέλιπε Ναβουχοδονόσορ βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος, καὶ κατέστησεν
23 ἐπ᾿ αὐτῶν τὸν Γοδολίαν υἱὸν Ἀχικάμ υἱοῦ Σαφάν. Καὶ ἤκουσαν
πάντες οἱ ἄρχοντες τῆς δυνάμεως, αὐτοί, καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες αὐτῶν,
ὅτι κατέστησε βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος τὸν Γοδολίαν, καὶ ἦλθον
πρὸς Γοδολίαν εἰς Μασσηφᾶ, καὶ Ἰσμαὴλ υἱὸς Ναθανίου, καὶ
Ἰωναν υἱὸς Καρηθ, καὶ Σαραίας υἱὸς Θαναμὰθ ὁ Νετωφαθί-
της, καὶ Ἰεζονίας υἱὸς τοῦ Μαχαθεῖ, αὐτοί, καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες
24 αὐτῶν. Καὶ ὤμοσεν αὐτοῖς Γοδολίας, καὶ τοῖς ἀνδράσιν αὐτῶν,
καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· μὴ φοβεῖσθε πάροδον τῶν Χαλδαίων, καθί-
σατε ἐν τῇ γῇ, καὶ δουλεύσατε τῷ βασιλεῖ Βαβυλῶνος, καὶ
25 καλῶς ἔσται ὑμῖν. Καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐν τῷ ἑβδόμῳ μηνὶ ἦλθεν Ἰσμαὴλ
υἱὸς Ναθανίου υἱοῦ Ἐλισαμὰ ἐκ τοῦ σπέρματος τῶν βασιλέων,
καὶ δέκα ἄνδρες μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπάταξαν τὸν Γοδολίαν, καὶ
ἀπέθανε, καὶ τοὺς Ἰουδαίους, καὶ τοὺς Χαλδαίους, οἳ ἦσαν με-
26 τ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἐν Μασσηφᾷ. Καὶ ἀνέστη πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ἀπὸ μικροῦ, καὶ ἕως
μεγάλου, καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες τῶν δυνάμεων, καὶ εἰσῆλθον εἰς Αἴγυ-
27 πτον, ὅτι ἐφοβήθησαν ἀπὸ προσώπου τῶν Χαλδαίων. Καὶ ἐγενήθη
ἐν τῷ τριακοστῷ καὶ ἑβδόμῳ ἔτει τῆς μετοικεσίας τοῦ Ἰωαχεὶν
βασιλέως Ἰούδα, ἐν τῷ δωδεκάτῳ μηνί, ἑβδόμῃ καὶ εἰκάδι τοῦ
μηνός, ὕψωσεν Εὐειλμαρωδὰχ βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος ἐν τῷ ἐνιαυτῷ
τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ τὴν κεφαλὴν Ἰωαχεὶν βασιλέως Ἰούδα, καὶ
28 ἐξήγαγεν αὐτὸν ἐξ οἴκου φυλακῆς αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐλάλησε μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ
ἀγαθά, καὶ ἔδωκε τὸν θρόνον αὐτοῦ ἐπάνωθεν τῶν θρόνων τῶν
29 βασιλέων τῶν μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἐν Βαβυλῶνι. Καὶ ἠλλοίωσε τὰ ἱμάτια
τῆς φυλακῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἤσθιεν ἄρτον διαπαντὸς ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ.
30 πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς ζωῆς αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἡ ἑστιατορία αὐτοῦ
ἑστιατορία διαπαντὸς ἐδόθη αὐτῷ ἐξ οἴκου τοῦ βασιλέως, λόγον
ἡμέρας ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ αὐτοῦ, πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς ζωῆς αὐτοῦ.

### English Translation

### 2 Kings 25

**19** ...the scribe of the captain of the host, even him that mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, such as were found in the city.
**20** And Nebuzaradan, the chief executioner, took them, and brought them unto the king of Babylon, to Riblah.
**21** And the king of Babylon struck them, and put them to death in Riblah, in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away captive from his own land.
**22** As for the people who remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, had left, he appointed over them Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan.
**23** And all the captains of the forces, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor; and they came unto Gedaliah at Mizpah: [even] Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men.
**24** And Gedaliah swore unto them, and unto their men, and said to them: "Fear ye not the approach of the Chaldeans; dwell ye in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you."
**25** And it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal seed, came, and ten men with him, and they smote Gedaliah, that he died; and [they smote] the Jews and the Chaldeans that were with him in Mizpah.
**26** And all the people arose, from the least even unto the greatest, and the captains of the forces, and they went into Egypt; for they were afraid of the Chaldeans.
**27** And it came to pass in the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin, king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, that Evil-merodach, king of Babylon, in the year of his [own] reign, did lift up the head of Jehoiachin, king of Judah, and brought him forth out of the house of his prison.
**28** And he spoke kindly with him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon.
**29** And he did change the garments of his prison, and he did eat bread continually before him, all the days of his life.
**30** And his allowance, even a continual allowance, was given him from the king's house, a portion for each day on its day, all the days of his life.
