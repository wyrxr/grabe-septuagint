σὲ ἄνθρωπος. Καὶ ἐπάταξεν Κύριος τοὺς Αἰθίοπας ἐναντίον Ἰούδα, 12
καὶ ἔφυγον οἱ Αἰθίοπες· καὶ κατεδίωξεν αὐτοὺς Ἀσὰ καὶ ὁ λαὸς 13
αὐτοῦ ἕως Γεδώρ. καὶ ἔπεσον Αἰθίοπες ὥστε μὴ εἶναι ἐν αὐτοῖς
περιποίησιν, ὅτι συνετρίβησαν ἐνώπιον Κυρίου, καὶ ἐνώπιον τῆς
δυνάμεως αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐσκύλευσαν σκῦλα πολλά. Καὶ ἐξέκοψαν τὰς 14
κώμας αὐτῶν κύκλῳ Γεδώρ, ὅτι ἐγενήθη ἔκστασις Κυρίου ἐπ’ αὐ-
τοὺς, καὶ ἐσκύλευσαν πάσας τὰς πόλεις αὐτῶν, ὅτι πολλὰ σκῦλα
ἐγενήθη αὐτοῖς. καὶ γε σκηνὰς κτήσεων, τοὺς Ἀμαζονεῖς ἐξέκο- 15
ψαν, καὶ ἔλαβον πρόβατα πολλὰ καὶ καμήλους, καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν εἰς
Ἱερουσαλήμ.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΕʹ. XV.

Καὶ Ἀζαρίας υἱὸς Ὠδὴδ, ἐγένετο ἐπ’ αὐτὸν πνεῦμα Κυρίου. 1
Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν εἰς ἀπάντησιν Ἀσὰ, καὶ παντὶ Ἰούδα καὶ Βενιαμείν, 2
καὶ εἶπεν· ἀκούσατέ μου, Ἀσὰ, καὶ πᾶς Ἰούδας καὶ Βενιαμείν·
Κύριος μεθ’ ὑμῶν ἐν τῷ εἶναι ὑμᾶς μετ’ αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐὰν ἐκζητή-
σητε αὐτὸν, εὑρεθήσεται ὑμῖν· καὶ ἐὰν ἐγκαταλείπητε αὐτὸν, ἐγ-
καταλείψει ὑμᾶς. Καὶ ἡμέραι πολλαὶ τῷ Ἰσραὴλ ἐν οὐ θεῷ ἀλη- 3
θινῷ, καὶ οὐχ ἱερέως ὑποδεικνύντος, καὶ ἐν οὐ νόμῳ. Καὶ ἐπι- 4
στρέψει αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ Κύριον Θεὸν Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ εὑρεθήσεται αὐτοῖς.
Καὶ ἐν ἐκείνῳ τῷ καιρῷ οὐκ ἔστιν εἰρήνη τῷ ἐκπορευομένῳ, καὶ 5
τῷ εἰσπορευομένῳ, ὅτι ἔκστασις Κυρίου ἐπὶ πάντας τοὺς κατοί-
κοῦντας τὰς χώρας. Καὶ πολεμήσει ἔθνος πρὸς ἔθνος, καὶ πόλις 6
πρὸς πόλιν, ὅτι ὁ Θεὸς ἐξέστησεν αὐτοὺς ἐν πάσῃ θλίψει. Καὶ 7
ὑμεῖς ἰσχύσατε, καὶ μὴ ἐκλυέσθωσαν αἱ χεῖρες ὑμῶν, ὅτι ἐστὶ μι-
σθὸς τῇ ἐργασίᾳ ὑμῶν. Καὶ ἐν τῷ ἀκοῦσαι τοὺς λόγους τούτους, 8
καὶ τὴν προφητείαν Ἀζαρίου τοῦ προφήτου, καὶ κατίσχυσε καὶ
ἐξέβαλε τὰ βδελύγματα ἀπὸ πάσης τῆς γῆς Ἰούδα, καὶ Βενια-
μείν, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν πόλεων ὧν κατέσχεν ἐν ὄρει Ἐφραὶμ, καὶ ἐν-
εκαίνισε τὸ θυσιαστήριον Κυρίου, ὃ ἦν ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ ναοῦ Κυ-
ρίου. Καὶ ἐξεκκλησίασε τὸν Ἰούδαν, καὶ Βενιαμείν, καὶ τοὺς προσ- 9
ηλύτους τοὺς παροικοῦντας μετ’ αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ Ἐφραὶμ, καὶ ἀπὸ
Μανασσῆ, καὶ ἀπὸ Συμεών, ὅτι προσετέθησαν πρὸς αὐτὸν πολλοὶ
τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τῷ ἰδεῖν αὐτοὺς, ὅτι Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς αὐτοῦ μετ’ αὐ-
τοῦ. Καὶ συνήχθησαν εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐν τῷ μηνὶ τῷ τρίτῳ ἐν 10

**Chapter 14**

¹²...O Lord our God, let not any man prevail against Thee."
And the Lord smote the Ethiopians before Judah;
¹³and the Ethiopians fled. And Asa and his people pursued them unto Gedor; and the Ethiopians fell, so that none were preserved alive among them, for they were shattered before the Lord, and before His might;
¹⁴and they plundered much spoil. And they cut off their villages round about Gedor; for a great dread from the Lord had fallen upon them; and they plundered all their cities, for much spoil was found in them.
¹⁵And yea, they cut off the tents of [their] possessions [and] the Amazons; and they took much sheep and camels, and returned to Jerusalem.

**Chapter 15**

¹And the Spirit of the Lord came upon Azariah the son of Oded.
²And he went out to meet Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin, and said, "Hearken unto me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin: The Lord is with you, while ye are with Him; and if ye seek Him, He will be found of you; but if ye forsake Him, He will forsake you.
³For many days Israel hath been without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law;
⁴yet shall they turn unto the Lord God of Israel, and He shall be found of them.
⁵And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in; for great terrors from the Lord were upon all the inhabitants of the lands.
⁶And nation shall be shattered against nation, and city against city,
⁷for God did vex them with all adversity. But be ye strong, and let not your hands be slack, for your work shall be rewarded."
⁸And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Azariah the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken in the Mount Ephraim; and he renewed the altar of the Lord, which was before the porch of the Lord.
⁹And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers that sojourned with them out of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and Simeon; for many of Israel had fallen to him, when they saw that the Lord his God was with him.
¹⁰So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in
