#### NEHEMIAH CHAPTER 8

<sup>3</sup> on the first [day] of the seventh month.
And Ezra read therein from the hour when the sun began to give light,
even until the midst of the day,
before the men and the women,
and those who could understand;
and the ears of all the people were attentive to the book of the Law.

<sup>4</sup> And Ezra the scribe stood upon a wooden pulpit;
and there stood beside him, on his right hand, Mattathias, and Samaías, and Ananias, and Ouria, and Chelkeia, and Maasia;
and on his left hand Phadaías, and Mishael, and Melchias, and Asom, and Asabadama, and Zacharias, and Mesollam.

<sup>5</sup> And Ezra opened the book before all the people;
for he was elevated above all the people.
And it came to pass, when he opened it, that all the people stood up.

<sup>6</sup> And Ezra blessed the Lord, the great God.
And all the people answered and said, "Amen!"
lifting up their hands;
and they bowed their heads, and prostrated themselves before the Lord, with their faces to the ground.

<sup>7</sup> And Jesus, and Banaías, and Sarabia, were instructing the people in the Law;
and the people remained in their station.

<sup>8</sup> And they read in the book of the Law of God,
and Ezra taught, and expounded [it], distinguishing [the meaning] with the knowledge of the Lord;

<sup>9</sup> And Nehemiah, and Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who instructed the people,
said unto all the people,
"This day is holy unto the Lord our God;

For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the Law.

<sup>10</sup> Then he said unto them,
"Go your way, eat the rich [foods], and drink the sweet [drinks],
and send portions unto those who have nought;
for this day is holy unto our Lord;
and be ye not disheartened, for it is our strength."

<sup>11</sup> And. the Levites silenced all the people, saying,

<sup>12</sup> "Be silent, for the day is holy; neither be cast down."
And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great rejoicing,
because they understood the words which had been made known unto them.

<sup>13</sup> And on the second day, the chiefs of the fathers' houses from among all the people,
the priests, and the Levites, gathered together unto Ezra the scribe,
to give heed unto all the words of the Law.

<sup>14</sup> And they found written in the Law,
which the Lord had commanded by Moses,
that the children of Israel should dwell in booths during the feast in the seventh month,

<sup>15</sup> and that they should proclaim with trumpets in all their cities, and in Jerusalem.
And Ezra said, "Go forth unto the mountain, and bring olive leaves, and leaves of cypress trees, and"
