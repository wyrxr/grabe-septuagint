          ἕκαστος ἐκ τῆς ἰδίας χώρας πρὸς αὐτὸν (τοῦ παρακαλέσαι καὶ ἐπισκέψασθαι αὐτόν.) Ἐλιφὰζ ὁ Θαιμανῶν βασιλεύς, καὶ Βαλδὰδ Σαυχαίων τύραννος, καὶ Σωφὰρ ὁ Μιναίων βασιλεύς· καὶ παρεγένοντο ὁμοθυμαδὸν πρὸς αὐτόν, τοῦ παρακαλέσαι καὶ ἐπισκέψασθαι αὐτόν.
12       Ἰδόντες δὲ αὐτὸν πόρρωθεν, οὐκ ἐπέγνωσαν, καὶ βοήσαντες φωνῇ μεγάλη ἔκλαυσαν· ῥήξαντες δὲ ἕκαστος τὴν ἑαυτοῦ στολήν, καὶ καταπασάμενοι γῆν ἐπὶ τὰς κεφαλὰς αὐτῶν εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν,
13       παρεκάθηντο αὐτῷ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας καὶ ἑπτὰ νύκτας, καὶ οὐδεὶς αὐτῶν ἐλάλησε πρὸς αὐτὸν λόγον· ἑώρων γὰρ τὴν πληγὴν δεινὴν οὖσαν καὶ μεγάλην σφόδρα.

1        (ΚΑΙ) μετὰ ταῦτα ἤνοιξεν Ἰὼβ τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ, καὶ κατηράσατο τὴν ἡμέραν αὐτοῦ·
2.3      καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Ἰὼβ, λέγων· ἀπόλοιτο ἡ ἡμέρα ἐν ᾗ ἐγεννήθην ἐν αὐτῇ καὶ ἡ νὺξ ἐν ᾗ εἶπον· ἰδοὺ ἄρσεν.
4        Ἡ ἡμέρα ἐκείνη εἴη σκότος, καὶ μὴ ἀναζητήσαι αὐτὴν ὁ Κύριος ἄνωθεν, μηδὲ ἔλθοι εἰς αὐτὴν φέγγος·
5        ἐκλάβοι δὲ αὐτὴν σκότος καὶ σκιὰ θανάτου, (καὶ) ἐπέλθοι ἐπ᾽ αὐτὴν γνόφος. Καὶ ταραχθείη ἡ
6        ἡμέρα (ἐκείνη), καὶ ἡ νὺξ ἐκείνη· ἀπενέγκοιτο αὐτὴν σκότος· μὴ
7        εἴη εἰς ἡμέρας ἐνιαυτοῦ, μηδὲ ἀριθμηθείη εἰς ἡμέρας μηνῶν. Ἀλλὰ ἡ νὺξ ἐκείνη εἴη ὀδύνη, καὶ μὴ ἔλθοι ἐπ᾽ αὐτὴν εὐφροσύνη, μηδὲ
8        χαρμονή· ἀλλὰ καταράσαιτο αὐτὴν ὁ καταρώμενος τὴν ἡμέραν ἐκείνην, ὁ μέλλων τὸ μέγα κῆτος χειρώσασθαι.
9        Σκοτωθείη τὰ ἄστρα τῆς νυκτὸς ἐκείνης· ὑπομείναι, καὶ μὴ ἔλθοι εἰς φωτισμόν, μηδὲ
10       ἴδοι ἑωσφόρον ἀνατέλλοντα· ὅτι οὐ συνέκλεισε πύλας γαστρὸς μητρός μου·
11       ἀπήλλαξε γὰρ ἂν πόνον ἀπὸ ὀφθαλμῶν μου. Διατί γὰρ ἐν κοιλίᾳ οὐκ ἐτελεύτησα; ἐκ γαστρὸς δὲ ἐξῆλθον, καὶ οὐκ εὐθὺς
12       ἀπωλόμην; (Και) ἵνατί συνήντησέ μοι γόνατα; ἵνατί δὲ μαστοὺς
13       ἐθήλασα (μητρός μου); (Νῦν ἂν κοιμηθεὶς ἡσύχασα, ὑπνώσας δὲ
14       ἀνεπαυσάμην, μετὰ βασιλέων καὶ βουλευτῶν γῆς, οἳ ἐγαυριῶντο
15       ἐπὶ ξίφεσι, καὶ μετὰ ἀρχόντων, ὧν πολὺς ὁ χρυσὸς, οἳ ἔπλησαν
16       τοὺς οἴκους αὐτῶν ἀργυρίου.) Ἡ ὥσπερ ἔκτρωμα ἐκπορευόμενον
17       ἐκ μήτρας μητρός, ἢ ὥσπερ νήπιοι οἳ οὐκ εἶδον φῶς. Ἐκεῖ ἀσεβεῖς
18       ἐξέπαυσαν θυμὸν ὀργῆς· ἐκεῖ ἀνεπαύσαντο κατάκοποι σώματι· ὁμοθυμαδὸν δὲ δι᾽ αἰῶνος εὐθηνήσαν, οὐκ (ἔτι) ἤκουσαν φωνὴν φορολόγου·

each one from his own country unto him, (to comfort and to visit him:) Eliphaz the king of the Temanites, and Bildad the ruler of the Shuhites, and Zophar the king of the Minaean; and they came together unto him, to comfort and to visit him.

12 And when they saw him afar off, they knew him not; and they lifted up their voice with a great cry, and wept. And each one tore his own garment, and they cast earth upon their heads toward heaven.

13 And they sat down with him upon the earth seven days and seven nights, and no man spake a word unto him; for they saw that his plague was sore and very great.

## CHAPTER III.

1 [And] after these things, Job opened his mouth, and cursed his day.

2-3 And Job answered and said, "Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night wherein they said, 'Behold, a male [child is born]!'"

4 "Let that day be darkness; let not the Lord seek it from above, nor let light come upon it.

5 But let darkness and the shadow of death seize upon it; [and] let thick gloom come upon it. And let that day, [even that day], and that night, be troubled;

6 Let darkness carry it away.

7 Let it not be among the days of the year, nor let it be numbered among the days of the months. But let that night be pain, and let not joy come upon it, nor gladness.

8 But let him curse it that curses that day, he that is about to subdue the great sea-monster."

9 "Let the stars of that night be darkened; let it wait, and let light not come [forth], nor let it behold the morning star ascending;

10 Because it shut not up the gates of my mother's womb.

11 For then would it have removed pain from my eyes. For why died I not in the womb? [Or] when I came forth from the belly, why perished I not straightway?

12 [And] wherefore did knees receive me? And wherefore did I suckle breasts [of my mother]?

13 (Now would I have lain down and been quiet; I would have slept, and then had I been at rest,

14 With kings and counselors of the earth, who gloried in swords;

15 And with princes, whose gold was abundant, who filled their houses with silver.)

16 Or as an untimely birth which cometh forth from the mother's womb, or as infants who have not seen light.

17 There the wicked have ceased from their raging anger; there those weary in body have rested.

18 But they prospered together for ever; they heard not [again] the voice of the tax-collector.
