### Chapter 8

**3** ...bearing tribute. And David smote Adraazar, the son of Raab, king of Souba, as he went forth to establish his dominion upon the river Euphrates.
**4** And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen. And David utterly disabled all the chariots, but reserved unto himself of them one hundred chariots.
**5** And the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Adraazar, king of Souba; and David smote of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.
**6** And David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought tribute. And the Lord preserved David whithersoever he went.
**7** And David took the golden armlets that were upon the servants of Adraazar, king of Souba, and brought them unto Jerusalem. And Sousakeim, king of Egypt, took them, when he went up against Jerusalem in the days of Rehoboam, the son of Solomon.
**8** And from Mazethch, and from the choice cities of Adraazar, did King David take exceeding much bronze. With this did Solomon make the bronze Sea, and the pillars, and the lavers, and all the vessels.
**9** Now when Thoei, the king of Hemath, heard that David had smitten all the host of Adraazar,
**10** he sent Ieddoram his son unto King David, to enquire of him concerning peace, and to bless him, because he had fought against Adraazar and smitten him; for Adraazar had been his adversary. And in his hand were vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of bronze.
**11** These also did King David consecrate unto the Lord, with the silver and the gold that he had consecrated from all the cities which he had subdued,
**12** from Idoumaia, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from Amalek, and from the Philistines; and from the spoils of Adraazar, the son of Raab, king of Souba.
**13** And David made him a name; and when he returned, he smote Idoumaia in Gemela, even eighteen thousand [men].
**14** And he put garrisons in Idoumaia; throughout all Idoumaia did he set appointed governors, and all the Idoumaeans became servants unto the king. And the Lord preserved David whithersoever he went.
**15** So David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice unto all his people.
**16** And Joab the son of Sarouia was over the host.
