### CHAPTER I.

**1** NOW it came to pass, after the death of Saul, that David returned from smiting the Amalekites, and David abode in Ziklag two days.
**2** And it came to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp, from the people of Saul, with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head. And it was so, when he came to David, that he fell upon his face to the earth, **3** and did obeisance unto him. And David said unto him, "Whence comest thou?" And he answered him, "Out of the camp of Israel have I escaped."
**4** And David said unto him, "What is the matter? Tell me, I pray thee." And he answered, "That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also."
**5** And David said unto the young man that told him, "How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?"
**6** And the young man that told him said, "By [chance] did they fall upon Mount Gilboa; and, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, behold, the chariots and **7** the horsemen pressed hard upon him, (and he fell). And he looked behind him, and saw me, and called unto me, and I answered, 'Here am I.'
**8** And he said unto me, 'Who art thou?' And I answered him, 'I am an Amalekite.'
**9** And he said unto me, 'Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me; for a terrible darkness hath seized me, for all my soul is yet within me.'
**10** So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I knew that he could not live after his fall; and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was upon his arm, **11** and have brought them hither unto my lord." Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were [with him].
