σπάρη ἐπάνωθεν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ συνέλαβον τὸν βασιλέα, καὶ ἤγα- 6
γον αὐτὸν πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Βαβυλῶνος εἰς Δεβλαθά· καὶ ἐ-
λάλησε μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ κρίσιν. Καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς Σεδεκίου ἔσφαξε κα- 7
τ᾿ ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς Σεδεκίου ἐξετύφλωσε,
καὶ ἔδησεν αὐτὸν ἐν πέδαις, καὶ ἤγαγεν εἰς Βαβυλῶνα. Καὶ ἐν 8

νεακαιδέκατος τῷ Ναβουχοδονόσορ βασιλεῖ Βαβυλῶνος) (καὶ)
ἦλθε Ναβουζαρδὰν ὁ ἀρχιμάγειρος, ἑστὼς ἐνώπιον Βασιλέως 9
Βαβυλῶνος, εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ ἐνέπρησε τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου,
καὶ τὸν οἶκον τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ πάντα τοὺς οἴκους Ἱερου-

Ναβουζαρδὰν ὁ ἀρχιμάγειρος. Καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν πτωχῶν τῆς γῆς 12
ὑπέλιπεν ὁ ἀρχιμάγειρος εἰς ἀμπελουργούς, καὶ εἰς Γηβείμ.
Καὶ τοὺς στύλους τοὺς χαλκοῦς τοὺς ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου, καὶ τοὺς 13
Μεχωνῶ, καὶ τὴν θάλασσαν τὴν χαλκῆν τὴν ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου
συνέτριψαν οἱ Χαλδαῖοι, καὶ ἦραν τὸν χαλκὸν αὐτῶν εἰς Βα-
βυλῶνα. Καὶ τοὺς λέβητας, καὶ τὰ Ἰαμίν, καὶ τὰς φιάλας, 14
καὶ τὰς θυίσκας, καὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη τὰ χαλκᾶ ἐν οἷς λει-
τουργοῦσιν ἐν αὐτοῖς, ἔλαβε. Καὶ τὰ πυρεῖα, καὶ τὰς φιάλας 15
τὰς ἀργυρᾶς, καὶ τὰς χρυσᾶς ἔλαβεν ὁ ἀρχιμάγειρος, στύλους 16
δύο, καὶ τὴν θάλασσαν μίαν, καὶ τὰς Μεχωνῶ ἃς ἐποίησε
Σαλωμὼν τῷ οἴκῳ Κυρίου· οὐκ ἦν σταθμὸς τοῦ χαλκοῦ πάντων
τῶν σκευῶν. Ὀκτωκαίδεκα πηχῶν ὕψος τοῦ στύλου τοῦ ἑνός, 17
καὶ τὸ χωθὰρ ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῦ τὸ χαλκοῦν. καὶ τὸ ὕψος τοῦ χωθὰρ
τριῶν πηχῶν· Σαβαχά, καὶ ῥοαὶ ἐπὶ τοῦ χωθὰρ κύκλῳ, τὰ
πάντα χαλκᾶ, καὶ κατὰ τὰ αὐτὰ τῷ στύλῳ τῷ δευτέρῳ ἐπὶ
τῷ Σαβαχά. Καὶ ἔλαβεν ὁ ἀρχιμάγειρος τὸν Σαραίαν ἱερέα τὸν 18
πρῶτον, καὶ τὸν Σοφονίαν υἱὸν τῆς δευτερώσεως, καὶ τοὺς
τρεῖς τοὺς φυλάσσοντας τὸν σταθμόν. Καὶ ἐκ τῆς πόλεως ἔλα- 19
βεν εὐνοῦχον ἕνα, ὃς ἦν ἐπιστάτης ἐπὶ τῶν ἀνδρῶν τῶν πο-
