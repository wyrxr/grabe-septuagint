9 σης. Καὶ εἶπε τοῖς ἀγγέλοις υἱοῦ Ἄδερ˙ λέγετε τῷ κυρίῳ ὑμῶν
τῷ βασιλεῖ˙ πάντα ὅσα ἀπέσταλκας πρὸς τὸν δοῦλόν σου, ἐν πρώτοις ποιήσω, τὸ δὲ ῥῆμα τοῦτο οὐ δυνήσομαι ποιῆσαι˙ καὶ ἀπῆ-
10 ραν οἱ ἄνδρες, καὶ ἀνέστρεψαν αὐτῷ λόγον. Καὶ ἀνταπέστειλε πρὸς
αὐτὸν υἱὸς Ἄδερ, λέγων˙ τάδε ποιήσαισάν μοι οἱ θεοί, καὶ τάδε
προσθείησαν, εἰ ἐκποιήσει ὁ χοῦς Σαμαρείας ταῖς ἀλώπεξι παντὶ
11 τῷ λαῷ, τοῖς πεζοῖς μου. Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη βασιλεὺς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ
12 εἶπεν˙ ἰκανούσθω˙ μὴ καυχάσθω ὁ κυρτός, ὡς ὁ ὀρθός. Καὶ ἐ-
γένετο ὡς ἀπεκρίθη αὐτῷ τὸν λόγον τοῦτον, πίνων ἦν αὐτός, καὶ
πάντες οἱ βασιλεῖς μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ ἐν σκηναῖς˙ καὶ εἶπε τοῖς παισίν
αὐτοῦ˙ οἰκοδομήσατε χάρακα˙ καὶ ἔθεντο χάρακα ἐπὶ τὴν πόλιν.
13 Καὶ ἰδοὺ προφήτης εἷς προσῆλθε τῷ Ἀχαὰβ τῷ βασιλεῖ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ εἶπε˙ τάδε λέγει Κύριος˙ εἰ ἑώρακας πάντα τὸν ὄχλον
τὸν μέγαν τοῦτον; ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ δίδωμι αὐτὸν εἰς χεῖρας σὰς σήμε-
14 ρον, καὶ γνώσῃ ὅτι ἐγὼ Κύριος. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἀχαάβ˙ ἐν
τίνι; καὶ εἶπε˙ τάδε λέγει Κύριος˙ ἐν τοῖς παιδαρίοις τῶν ἀρ-
χόντων τῶν χωρῶν˙ καὶ εἶπεν Ἀχαάβ˙ τίς συνάψει τὸν πόλεμον;
15 καὶ εἶπε˙ σύ. Καὶ ἐπεσκέψατο τοὺς παῖδας τῶν ἀρχόντων τῶν
χωρῶν˙ καὶ ἐγένοντο διακόσιοι τριάκοντα καὶ δύο˙ καὶ μετὰ ταῦ-
τα ἐπεσκέψατο σύμπαντα τὸν λαόν, πάντα υἱὸν δυνάμεως, ἑπτὰ
16 χιλιάδας. Καὶ ἐξῆλθε μεσημβρίας˙ καὶ υἱὸς Ἄδερ πίνων, μεθύων
ἐν Σοκχὼθ αὐτὸς καὶ οἱ βασιλεῖς, τριάκοντα καὶ δύο βασιλεῖς συμ-
17 βοηθοὶ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐξῆλθον παιδάρια ἀρχόντων τῶν χωρῶν ἐν πρώ-
τοις˙ καὶ ἀπέστειλεν υἱὸς Ἄδερ, καὶ ἀνήγγειλαν αὐτῷ, λέγοντες.
18 ἄνδρες ἐξεληλύθασιν ἐκ Σαμαρείας. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς˙ εἰ εἰς εἰ-
ρήνην ἐκπορεύονται, συλλάβετε αὐτοὺς ζῶντας, καὶ εἰ εἰς πόλε-
19 μον ἐξῆλθον, ζῶντας συλλάβετε αὐτούς. Καὶ μὴ ἐξελθάτωσαν ἐκ
τῆς πόλεως τὰ παιδάρια ἀρχόντων τῶν χωρῶν˙ καὶ ἡ δύναμις
20 ὀπίσω αὐτῶν, ἐπάταξεν ἕκαστος τὸν παρ᾽ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔφυγε Συ-
ρία˙ καὶ κατεδίωξεν αὐτοὺς Ἰσραήλ˙ καὶ σώζεται υἱὸς Ἄδερ βα-
21 σιλεὺς Συρίας ἐφ᾽ ἵππῳ σὺν ἱππεῦσι τισί. Καὶ ἐξῆλθε βασιλεὺς
Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἔλαβε τοὺς ἵππους, καὶ τὰ ἅρματα, καὶ ἐπάταξεν ἐν
22 Συρίᾳ πληγὴν μεγάλην. Καὶ προσῆλθεν ὁ προφήτης πρὸς βασιλέα
Ἰσραήλ, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ˙ κραταιοῦ, καὶ γνῶθι, καὶ ἴδε τί ποιή-
σεις, ὅτι ἐπιστρέψαντος τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ υἱὸς Ἄδερ βασιλεὺς Συρίας
23 ἄνεισιν ἐπί σε. Καὶ οἱ παῖδες βασιλέως Συρίας εἶπαν πρὸς αὐτόν˙

**Chapter 20**
**9** Then he said unto the messengers of Ben-Hadad, "Say ye unto your lord the king, 'All whatsoever thou didst send unto thy servant at the first, I will surely do; but this thing I may not do.' " And the men departed, and brought him word again.
**10** And Ben-Hadad sent again unto him, saying, "Thus do the gods unto me, and more also add they, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for the foxes [of] all my people, even my footmen."
**11** And the king of Israel answered and said, "Let him be content; let not him that girdeth [on his armor] boast himself as he that unarmeth [it]."
**12** And it came to pass, when he had answered him this word, that Ben-Hadad himself was drinking, and all the kings with him in tents; and he said unto his servants, "Build ye a palisade!" And they set a palisade against the city.
**13** And behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab the king of Israel, and said, "Thus saith the Lord: Hast thou seen all this great multitude? Behold, I give him into thy hands this day, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord."
**14** And Ahab said, "By whom?" And he said, "Thus saith the Lord: By the young men of the princes of the provinces." And Ahab said, "Who shall join the battle?"
**15** And he said, "Thou." And he reviewed the young men of the princes of the provinces; and they were two hundred and thirty-two. And after these, he reviewed all the people, every son of strength, seven thousand.
**16** And they went out at noon. And Ben-Hadad was drinking, being drunken in Succoth, he and the kings, thirty and two kings, his fellow helpers.
**17** And the young men of the princes of the provinces went forth first. And Ben-Hadad sent [scouts], and they brought him word, saying,
**18** "Men have come forth from Samaria." And he said unto them, "If they come forth for peace, seize them alive; and if they came forth for war, seize them alive."
**19** And let not the young men of the princes of the provinces go forth from the city! And the force
**20** behind them, each smote his man; and Syria fled, and Israel pursued them. And Ben-Hadad, king of Syria, escaped on a horse with certain horsemen.
**21** And the king of Israel went forth, and took the horses, and the chariots, and smote Syria with a great slaughter.
**22** And the prophet came near unto the king of Israel, and said unto him, "Strengthen thyself, and know, and see what thou shalt do; for at the return of the year, Ben-Hadad, king of Syria, shall come up against thee."
**23** And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him,
