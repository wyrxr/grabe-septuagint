...of the sons of Ithamar, according to their registration, according to their service, by the houses of their ancestral families.
4 And the sons of Eleazar were found to be more numerous for chief men among the mighty, than were the sons of Ithamar.
And he divided them, allotting unto the sons of Eleazar sixteen chiefs of ancestral houses, and unto the sons of Ithamar eight, according to their ancestral houses.
5 And he divided them by lots, these over against those; for they were governors of the sanctuary, and rulers for the Lord, among the sons of Eleazar and among the sons of Ithamar.
6 And Shemaiah, the son of Nethaneel, the scribe, from the Levites, wrote them down before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the chiefs of the ancestral houses of the priests, and of the Levites, [assigning] one by one unto Eleazar, and one by one unto Ithamar.

28 Unto Mahli, Eleazar.
