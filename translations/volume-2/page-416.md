**Ι Ω Β. ΚΕΦ. Α΄.**

11 εὐλόγησας, καὶ τὰ κτήνη αὑτοῦ πολλὰ ἐποίησας ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς. Ἀλλὰ
    ἀπόστειλον τὴν χεῖρά σου, καὶ ἅψαι πάντων ὧν ἔχει· εἰ μὴν εἰς
    πρόσωπόν σου σὲ εὐλογήσει.
12 Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ Κύριος τῷ διαβόλῳ· ἰδοὺ πάντα ὅσα ἐστὶν αὐτῷ, ἐν τῇ
    χειρί σου δίδωμι, ἀλλὰ αὐτοῦ μὴ
13 ἅψῃ. Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ὁ διάβολος ἀπὸ προσώπου Κυρίου. Καὶ ἐγένετο
    ὡς ἡ ἡμέρα αὕτη, καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ Ἰώβ, καὶ αἱ θυγατέρες αὐτοῦ
    ἤσθιον καὶ ἔπινον οἶνον ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτῶν τοῦ
14 πρεσβυτέρου. Καὶ ἰδοὺ ἄγγελος ἦλθε πρὸς Ἰώβ, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ·
    τὰ ζεύγη τῶν βοῶν ἠροτρία, καὶ αἱ θήλειαι ὄνοι ἐβόσκοντο ἐχόμε-
15 ναι αὐτῶν· καὶ ἐλθόντες οἱ αἰχμαλωτεύοντες ᾐχμαλώτευσαν αὐτοὺς,
    καὶ τοὺς παῖδας ἐπάταξαν ἐν στόματι μαχαίρας· καὶ ἐσώθην ἐγὼ
    μόνος, καὶ ἦλθον τοῦ ἀπαγγεῖλαί σοι.
16 Ἔτι τούτου λαλοῦντος, ἦλθεν ἕτερος ἄγγελος πρὸς Ἰώβ, καὶ εἶπεν
    αὐτῷ· πῦρ Θεοῦ ἔπεσεν ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ (ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν), καὶ κατέκαυσε
    τὰ πρόβατα, καὶ τοὺς ποιμένας κατέφαγεν ὁμοίως· καὶ ἐσώθην ἐγὼ
    μόνος, καὶ ἦλθον τοῦ ἀπαγγεῖλαί σοι.
17 Ἔτι τούτου λαλοῦντος, ἕτερος ἄγγελος ἔρχεται πρὸς Ἰώβ, καὶ λέγει
    αὐτῷ· οἱ ἱππεῖς ἐποίησαν ἡμῖν ἀρχὰς τρεῖς, καὶ ἐκύκλωσαν τὰς
    καμήλους, καὶ ᾐχμαλώτευσαν αὐτὰς, καὶ τοὺς παῖδας ἀπέκτειναν
    ἐν μαχαίραις· καὶ ἐσώθην ἐγὼ μόνος, καὶ ἦλθον τοῦ ἀπαγγεῖλαί σοι.
18 Ἔτι τούτου λαλοῦντος, ἄλλος ἄγγελος ἔρχεται πρὸς Ἰώβ, λέγων· τῶν
    υἱῶν σου καὶ τῶν θυγατέρων σου ἐσθιόντων καὶ πινόντων οἶνον
    παρὰ (τῷ υἱῷ σου) τῷ ἀδελφῷ αὐτῶν τῷ πρεσβυτέρῳ,
19 ἐξαίφνης πνεῦμα μέγα ἦλθεν ἀπὸ τῆς ἐρήμου, καὶ ἥψατο τῶν
    τεσσάρων γωνιῶν τῆς οἰκίας, καὶ ἔπεσεν ἡ οἰκία ἐπὶ τὰ παιδία σου,
    καὶ ἐτελεύτησαν· καὶ ἐσώθην ἐγὼ μόνος, καὶ ἦλθον τοῦ ἀπαγγεῖλαί σοι.
20 Οὕτως (ἀκούσας) Ἰὼβ ἀναστὰς διέρρηξε τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐκείρατο
    τὴν κόμην τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ, (καὶ κατεπάσατο γῆν ἐπὶ τῆς κεφαλῆς
    αὐτοῦ,) καὶ
21 πεσὼν χαμαὶ προσεκύνησε (τῷ Κυρίῳ), καὶ εἶπεν· αὐτὸς γυμνὸς
    ἐξῆλθον ἐκ κοιλίας μητρός μου, γυμνὸς καὶ ἀπελεύσομαι ἐκεῖ· ὁ
    Κύριος ἔδωκεν, ὁ Κύριος ἀφείλατο· ὡς τῷ Κυρίῳ ἔδοξεν, οὕτω καὶ
    ἐγένετο· εἴη τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου εὐλογημένον (εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας).
22 Ἐν τούτοις πᾶσι τοῖς συμβεβηκόσιν αὐτῷ οὐχ ἥμαρτεν Ἰὼβ οὐδὲν
    ἔναντι Κυρίου, (οὐδὲ ἐν τοῖς χείλεσιν αὐτοῦ)· καὶ οὐκ ἔδωκεν
    ἀφροσύνην τῷ Θεῷ.

11 Thou hast blessed, and his cattle Thou hast multiplied upon the earth.
    But stretch forth now Thy hand, and touch all that he hath; [and see]
    if he will not curse Thee to Thy face.

12 And the Lord said unto the devil, "Behold, all that he hath, I give into
    thy hand; but against his person, thou shalt not stretch forth thy
    hand."
13 So the devil went forth from the presence of the Lord. And it came to
    pass on a certain day, that the sons of Job, and his daughters, did eat
    and drink wine in the house of their eldest brother.

14 And behold, there came a messenger unto Job, and said unto him,
    "The yokes of oxen were ploughing, and the she-asses were grazing
    beside them;
15 and those who led captive came and carried them away captive, and smote
    the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to
    tell thee."

16 While he was yet speaking, there came another messenger unto Job, and
    said unto him, "The fire of God fell from heaven (upon the earth), and
    burned up the sheep, and devoured the shepherds likewise; and I only am
    escaped alone to tell thee."

17 While he was yet speaking, there came another messenger unto Job, and
    saith unto him, "The horsemen formed for us three bands, and
    surrounded the camels, and carried them away captive, and slew the
    servants with swords; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee."

18 While he was yet speaking, another messenger came unto Job, saying,
    "While thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine with
    (thy son) their eldest brother,
19 suddenly a great wind came from the desert, and smote the four corners
    of the house, and the house fell upon thy children, and they died; and
    I only am escaped alone to tell thee."

20 Thus (having heard) Job arose, and tore his garments, and shaved the
    hair of his head, (and sprinkled earth upon his head,)
21 and falling to the ground he worshipped (the Lord), and said, "Naked
    came I forth from my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither;
    the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; as it pleased the Lord,
    so also it came to pass; blessed be the Name of the Lord (unto the ages)."

22 In all these things that befell him, Job sinned nothing before the Lord,
    (neither with his lips); nor did he ascribe folly unto God.
