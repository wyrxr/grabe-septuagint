ΚΕΦ. ΚΗ΄. XXVIII.
10 ἐξέτεινε χεῖρα αὐτοῦ, κατέστρεψε (δὲ) ἐκ ῥιζῶν ὄρη· δίνας δὲ πο-
11 ταμῶν ἔῤῥηξε, πᾶν δὲ τίμιον ἴδεν αὐτοῦ ὁ ὀφθαλμός· καὶ βάθη
12 ποταμῶν ἀνεκάλυψεν, ἔδειξε δὲ αὐτοῦ δύναμιν εἰς φῶς. Ἡ δὲ
13 σοφία πόθεν εὑρέθη; ποῖος δὲ τόπος ἐστὶν ἐπιστήμης; Οὐκ
14 οἶδε βροτὸς ὁδὸν αὐτῆς, οὐδὲ μὴ εὑρέθῃ ἐν ἀνθρώποις. Ἄβυσ-
15 σος εἶπεν, οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν ἐμοί· καὶ θάλασσα εἶπεν, οὐκ ἔστι μετ᾿
16 ἐμοῦ. Οὐ δώσει σύγκλεισμον ἀντ᾿ αὐτῆς, καὶ οὐ σταθήσεται ἀρ-
17 γύριον ἀντάλλαγμα αὐτῆς. Καὶ οὐ συμβασταχθήσεται χρυσίῳ
18 Ὤφειρ, ἐν ὄνυχι τιμίῳ καὶ σαπφείρῳ· (καὶ) οὐκ ἰσωθήσεται
19 αὐτῇ χρυσίον καὶ ὕαλος, καὶ τὸ ἄλλαγμα αὐτῆς σκεύη χρυσᾶ.
20 Μετέωρα καὶ Γαβεῖς οὐ μνησθήσεται, καὶ ἔλκυσον σοφίαν ὑπὲρ
21 τὰ ἐσώτατα· οὐκ ἰσωθήσεται αὐτῇ τοπάζιον Αἰθιοπίας, χρυσίῳ
22 καθαρῷ οὐ συμβασταχθήσεται. Ἡ δὲ σοφία πόθεν εὑρέθη; ποῖος
23 δέ ἐστι τόπος συνέσεως; Λέληθε πάντα ἄνθρωπον, καὶ ἀπὸ πετει-
24 νῶν τοῦ οὐρανοῦ (οὐκ) ἐκρύβη. Ἡ ἀπώλεια καὶ ὁ θάνατος εἶπαν,
25 ἀκηκόαμεν αὐτῆς τὸ κλέος. Ὁ Θεὸς εὖ συνέστησεν αὐτῆς τὴν
26 ὁδόν· αὐτὸς γὰρ οἶδε τὸν τόπον αὐτῆς. Αὐτὸς γὰρ τὴν ὑπ᾿ οὐ-
27 ρανὸν πᾶσαν ἐφορᾷ, εἰδὼς τὰ ἐν τῇ γῇ πάντα ἃ ἐποίησεν, (ἐποίη-
28 σε δὲ) ἀνέμων σταθμόν, καὶ ὑδάτων μέτρα. Ὅτε ἐποίησεν οὗτος
29 ὑετόν, ἠρίθμησε, καὶ ὁδὸν ἐντινάγματι φωνῆς. Τότε ἴδεν αὐτήν,
30 καὶ ἐξηγήσατο αὐτήν, ἑτοιμάσας ἐξιχνίασεν. Εἶπε δὲ ἀνθρώπῳ·
31 ἰδοὺ ἡ θεοσέβεια ἐστι σοφία, τὸ δὲ ἀπέχεσθαι ἀπὸ κακῶν, ἐστὶν
32 ἐπιστήμη.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΘ´. XXIX.

1 ΠΡΟΣΘΕΣΙΣ δὲ ἔτι τῷ προοιμίῳ Ἰὼβ λέγει: τίς ἄν με θείη
2 (μῆνα) κατὰ μῆνα (ἡμερῶν) τῶν ἔμπροσθεν ἡμερῶν, ὧν ὁ Θεὸς
3 ἐφύλαττέ με; Ὡς ὅτε ηὔγει λύχνος αὐτοῦ ὑπὲρ κεφαλῆς μου,
4 ὅτε ἐν τῷ φωτὶ αὐτοῦ ἐπορευόμην ἐν σκότει· ὅτε ἤμην ἐπιβρι-
5 θων ὁδοῖς, ὅτε ὁ Κύριος ἐπισκοπὴν ἐποιεῖτο τοῦ οἴκου μου·
6 ὅτε ἤμην ὑλώδης λίαν, κύκλῳ δὲ μου οἱ παῖδες μου· ὅτε ἐ-
7 χέοντό μου αἱ ὁδοὶ βουτύρῳ, τὰ δὲ ὄρη μου ἐχείτο γάλακτι·
8 ὅτε ἐξεπορευόμην ὄρθριος ἐν πόλει, ἐν δὲ πλατείαις ἐτίθετό μου
9 ὁ δίφρος. Ἰδόντες με νεανίσκοι ἐκρύβησαν ἑαυτοῖς, πρεσβῦται
10 δὲ στάντες ἐπανάστησαν· ἄδροὶ δὲ ἐπαύσαντο λαλοῦντες, δάκτυ-
11 λον ἐπιτιθέντες ἐπὶ στόματι αὐτῶν. Οἱ δὲ ἀκούσαντες (περὶ
12 ἐμοῦ) ἐμακάρισάν με, καὶ γλῶσσα αὐτῶν τῷ λάρυγγι αὐτῶν
13 ἐκολλήθη· ὅτι οὓς ἤκουσε, καὶ ἐμακάρισέ με, ὀφθαλμὸς δέ με
14 ἰδὼν ἐξέκλινε. Διέσωσα γὰρ πτωχὸν ἐκ χειρὸς δυνάστου, καὶ
15 ὀρφανῷ, ᾧ οὐχ ὑπῆρχε βοηθός, ἐβοήθησα· εὐλογία ἀπολλυμέ-
16 νου ἐπ᾽ ἐμὲ ἔλθοι, στόμα δὲ χήρας ηὐλόγησέ με. Δικαιοσύνη
17 δὲ ἐνεδύκειν, ἡμφιασάμην δὲ κρῖμα ἴσα διπλοΐδι. Ὀφθαλμὸς ἦ-
18 μην τυφλῷ, ποῦς δὲ χωλῷ· ἐγὼ ἤμην πατὴρ ἀδυνάτων, δίκην
19 δὲ ἣν οὐκ ᾔδειν ἐξιχνίασα· συνέτριψα δὲ μύλας ἀδίκων, ἐκ δὲ
20 μέσου ὁδόντων αὐτῶν ἅρπαγμα ἐξέσπασα. Εἶπον δέ· ἡλικία μου
21 γηράσει ὡς περ στέλεχος φοίνικος, πολὺν (δὲ) χρόνον βιώσω· ἡ
22 ῥίζα μου διήνοικται ἐπὶ ὕδατος, καὶ δρόσος αὐλισθήσεται ἐπὶ
23 τῷ θερισμῷ μου· ἡ δόξα μου καινὴ μετ᾽ ἐμοῦ, καὶ τὸ τόξον μου
24 ἐν χειρί μου πορεύσεται. (Πρεσβύτεροι) ἀκούσαντές μου προσέ-
25 χον, ἐσιώπησαν δὲ ἐπὶ τῇ ἐμῇ βουλῇ· ἐπὶ (δὲ) τῷ ἐμῷ ῥήματι
26 οὐ προσέθεντο, καὶ περιχαρεις ἐγίνοντο ὁπότε αὐτοῖς ἐλάλουν·
27 ὥσπερ γῆ διψῶσα προσδεχομένη ὑετόν, οὕτως οὗτοι τὴν ἐμὴν
28 λαλιὰν (προσεδέχοιτο). Εἰ ἐγέλων πρὸς αὐτοὺς, οὐκ ἐπίστευον·
29 καὶ φῶς τοῦ προσώπου μου οὐκ ἀπέπιπτεν. Ἐξελεξάμην ὁδὸν
30 αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐκάθισα ἄρχων, καὶ κατεσκήνουν ὡσεὶ βασιλεὺς ἐν
31 μονοζώνοις, ἐν τρόπον πενθινοὺς παρακαλῶν.

## CHAPTER XXVIII.

**10** He hath stretched forth his hand, [and] hath overturned mountains from their very roots.
**11** And he hath burst forth the sources of rivers, and his eye hath seen every precious thing.
**12** And the depths of rivers hath he uncovered, and his power hath he shown forth unto the light.
**13** But whence is wisdom found? And what place is [there] for understanding?
**14** Mortal man knows not her way, neither shall she be found among men.
**15** The Abyss hath said, 'It is not within me'; and the Sea hath said, 'It is not with me.'
**16** No price shall be given in exchange for her, nor shall silver be established as her ransom.
**17** Neither shall she be weighed against gold
**18** of Ophir, nor against precious onyx and sapphire; (and) neither shall she be equated with
**19** her, [neither] gold nor crystal; nor shall golden vessels be her exchange.
**20** Things held aloft, and Gabes, shall not be remembered; and draw forth wisdom
**21** from beyond the innermost parts. The topaz of Ethiopia shall not be equated with her,
**22** nor shall she be weighed against pure gold. But whence is wisdom found?
**23** And what place is [there] for understanding? It is hidden from all mankind,
**24** and from the birds of the heaven is it (not) hid.
**25** Perdition and Death have said, 'We have heard the report of her fame.'
**26** God hath well established her way; for He Himself knoweth her place.
**27** For He doth oversee all things that are under heaven, knowing all that He hath made in the earth;
**28** (and He hath made) a weight for the winds, and measures for the waters.
**29** When He made the rain, this [did He] number; and a path for the blast of a voice.
**30** Then did He see her, and declare her; having prepared, He did trace her out.
**31** And He said unto man: 'Behold, godliness is wisdom, and to abstain from evil is
**32** understanding.'

## CHAPTER XXIX.

**1** Moreover, Job continued yet his lament, and said: 'Oh, that one would set me
**2** [as I was in the] (month) from month to month, [and as in the] (days) of the former days, wherein God
**3** did keep watch over me! As when His lamp did shine above my head,
**4** when by His light I walked through darkness; when I was [still] full of vigor in my ways,
**5** when the Lord did oversee my house;
**6** when I was yet most verdant, and my children were round about me; when my
**7** paths did flow with butter, and my mountains did stream with milk;
**8** when I went forth early into the city, and in the broad places was set my
**9** throne. Young men, seeing me, hid themselves away; and the elders
**10** did stand, and rose up. And the mighty men ceased their speaking, laying a finger
**11** upon their mouths. And they who heard (concerning
**12** me) did bless me, and their tongue did cleave to their throats;
**13** because those whom it heard, it did bless me; and an eye, seeing me, did turn [and bear witness].
**14** For I delivered the poor from the hand of the oppressor, and
**15** to the orphan, who had no helper, did I give aid. The blessing of him that was perishing
**16** would come upon me, and the mouth of the widow did bless me. Righteousness
**17** did I put on, and I did array myself with judgment as with a double cloak.
**18** I was an eye to the blind, and a foot to the lame; I was a father to the helpless, and the cause
**19** which I knew not, did I search out. And I did break the jaws of the unrighteous, and from
**20** the midst of their teeth did I pluck the prey. And I said: 'My age
**21** shall grow old as a palm tree's trunk, and a long (while) shall I live. My
**22** root is opened wide unto the water, and dew shall lodge upon
**23** my harvest. My glory is renewed with me, and my bow
**24** in my hand shall go forth.' (Elders) hearing me, did attend,
**25** and were silent at my counsel; and at (my) word
**26** they did not add [anything], and they became exceedingly joyful when I spake unto them;
**27** as thirsty ground expecting rain, so did these receive my
**28** speech (would they receive). If I smiled upon them, they believed it not;
**29** and the light of my countenance did not diminish. I chose their way,
**30** and sat as a ruler, and I did dwell as a king among
**31** those who were alone, comforting mourners.
