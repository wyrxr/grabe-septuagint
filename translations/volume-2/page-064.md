**ΚΕΦ. ΚΘ΄. ΧΧΙΧ.**
**5** λέγοντες· ἐπάταξε Σαοὺλ ἐν χιλιάσιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ Δαυὶδ ἐν μυριάσιν;
**6** Καὶ ἐκάλεσεν Ἀγχοῦς τὸν Δαυίδ, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· Ζῇ Κύριος, ὅτι εὐθὺς σὺ καὶ ἀγαθὸς ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς μου, καὶ ἡ ἔξοδός σου καὶ ἡ εἴσοδός σου μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ, καὶ ὅτι οὐχ εὕρηκα ἐν σοὶ κακίαν ἀφ᾿ ἧς ἡμέρας ἥκεις πρὸς με ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας τῆς σήμερον, καὶ ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς τῶν σατραπῶν οὐκ ἀγαθὸς σύ.
**7** Καὶ νῦν ἀνάστρεφε καὶ πορεύου εἰς εἰρήνην, καὶ οὐ μὴ ποιήσεις κακίαν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς τῶν σατραπῶν τῶν ἀλλοφύλων.
**8** Καὶ εἶπε Δαυὶδ πρὸς Ἀγχοῦς· τί πεποίηκά σοι καὶ τί εὗρες ἐν τῷ δούλῳ σου ἀφ᾿ ἧς ἡμέρας ἤμην ἐνώπιόν σου καὶ ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης, ὅτι οὐ μὴ ἔλθω πολεμῆσαι τοὺς ἐχθροὺς τοῦ κυρίου μου τοῦ βασιλέως;
**9** Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Ἀγχοῦς καὶ εἶπε πρὸς Δαυίδ· οἶδα ὅτι ἀγαθὸς σὺ ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς μου καθὼς ἄγγελος Θεοῦ, ἀλλ᾿ οἱ σατράπαι τῶν ἀλλοφύλων λέγουσιν, οὐχ ἥξει μεθ᾿ ἡμῶν εἰς πόλεμον.
**10** Καὶ νῦν ὄρθρισον τοπρωΐ, καὶ οἱ παῖδες τοῦ κυρίου σου οἱ ἤκοντες μετὰ σοῦ, καὶ πορεύεσθε εἰς τὸν τόπον οὗ κατέστησα ὑμᾶς, καὶ λόγον λοιμὸν μὴ θῇς ἐν καρδίᾳ σου, ὅτι ἀγαθὸς σὺ ἐνώπιον ἐμοῦ, καὶ διορθίσατε ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ, καὶ φωτισάτω ὑμῖν, καὶ πορεύθητε.
**11** Καὶ ὤρθρισε Δαυὶδ αὐτὸς καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες αὐτοῦ ἀπελθεῖν τοπρωΐ καὶ φυλάσσειν τὴν γῆν τῶν ἀλλοφύλων, καὶ οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι ἀνέβησαν πολεμεῖν ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ.

**ΚΕΦ. Λ΄. XXX.**

**1** ΚΑΙ ἐγενήθη εἰσελθόντος Δαυὶδ καὶ τῶν ἀνδρῶν αὐτοῦ εἰς Σικελὰγ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τρίτῃ, καὶ Ἀμαλὴκ ἀπέθετο ἐπὶ τὸν νότον καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν Σικελὰγ, καὶ ἐπάταξε τὴν Σικελὰγ, καὶ ἐνέπρησεν αὐτὴν ἐν πυρί. Καὶ ᾐχμαλώτευσε καὶ τὰς γυναῖκας καὶ πάντα τὰ ἐν αὐτῇ ἀπὸ μικροῦ καὶ ἕως μεγάλου· οὐκ ἐθανάτωσεν ἄνδρα καὶ γυναῖκα, ἀλλ᾿ ᾐχμαλώτευσαν, καὶ ἀπῆλθον εἰς τὴν ὁδὸν αὐτῶν.
**3** Καὶ ἦλθε Δαυὶδ καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες αὐτοῦ εἰς τὴν πόλιν, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐμπεπύρισται ἐν πυρί, αἱ δὲ γυναῖκες αὐτῶν καὶ αἱ θυγατέρες αὐτῶν αἰχμαλωτευόμενοι.
**4** Καὶ ἦρε Δαυὶδ καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες αὐτοῦ τὴν φωνὴν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔκλαυσαν ἕως ὅτου οὐκ ἦν ἐν αὐτοῖς ἰσχὺς ἔτι τοῦ κλαίειν.
**5** Καὶ ἀμφότεραι αἱ γυναῖκες Δαυὶδ ᾐχμαλωτεύθησαν, Ἀχινάαμ ἡ Ἰεζραηλίτις, καὶ Ἀβιγαία ἡ γυνὴ Νάβαλ τοῦ

**CHAPTER XXIX.**

**5** ...singing, "Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands?"

**6** Then Achish called David, and said unto him, "As the LORD liveth, thou art upright, and good in my sight; and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the camp is [good]; for I have found no evil in thee since the day thou camest unto me, even unto this day. Nevertheless, in the eyes of the princes thou art not good.

**7** Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the princes of the Philistines."

**8** Then David said unto Achish, "What have I done to thee? And what hast thou found in thy servant, since the day I have been before thee even unto this day, that I may not go to fight against the enemies of my lord the King?"

**9** And Achish answered and said unto David, "I know that thou art good in my sight, as an angel of God; but the princes of the Philistines say, 'He shall not come up with us to battle.'

**10** Now therefore, rise up early in the morning, thou, and the servants of thy lord who came with thee, and go unto the place where I have appointed you. And set no evil matter in thine heart, for thou art good in my sight. And set yourselves aright on the way, and may light be unto you, then go."

**11** So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning, and to guard the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to fight against Israel.

**CHAPTER XXX.**

**1** AND it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that Amalek had invaded the south, and Ziklag; and they smote Ziklag, and burned it with fire. And they took captive both the women and all that were therein, from the least even unto the greatest; they slew no man nor woman, but carried them away captive, and went on their way.

**3** So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives and their daughters were taken captive.

**4** Then David and his men lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.

**5** And David's two wives were taken captive: Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the
