656 ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Γ´. ΚΕΦ. ΚΒ´.
φῆται ἐν στόματι ἑνὶ καλὰ περὶ τοῦ βασιλέως, γίνου δὴ καὶ σὺ
εἰς λόγους σου κατὰ τοὺς λόγους ἑνὸς τούτων, καὶ λάλῃσον καλά.
14 Καὶ εἶπε Μιχαίας· Ζῇ Κύριος, ὅτι ἃ ἐὰν εἴπῃ Κύριος πρὸς με,
15 ταῦτα λαλήσω. Καὶ ἦλθε πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα· καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασι-
λεὺς αὐτῷ· Μιχαία, εἰ ἀναβῶ εἰς Ῥεμμὰθ Γαλαὰδ εἰς πόλεμον
ἢ ἐπισχῶ; Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτόν· ἀνάβαινε, καὶ εὐοδώσῃ, καὶ δώ-
16 σει Κύριος εἰς χεῖρας τοῦ βασιλέως. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ βασι-
λεὺς· ἔτι δὶς ἐγὼ ὁρκίζω σε, ὅπως λαλήσῃς πρὸς με ἀλήθειαν ἐν
17 ὀνόματι Κυρίου; Καὶ εἶπεν, οὐχ οὕτως· ἑώρακα πάντα τὸν Ἰσ-
ραὴλ διεσπαρμένον ἐν τοῖς ὄρεσιν ὡς ποίμνιον, ᾧ οὐκ ἔστι ποι-
μή· καὶ εἶπε Κύριος· οὐ κύριος τούτοις· ἀναστρεφέτω ἕκαστος
18 εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ ἐν εἰρήνῃ. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ
πρὸς Ἰωσαφὰτ βασιλέα Ἰούδα· οὐκ εἶπα πρὸς σὲ, ὅτι οὐ προφη-
19 τεύει οὗτός μοι καλὰ, ἀλλ᾿ ἢ κακά; Καὶ εἶπε Μιχαίας·
οὐχ οὕτως· οὐχ ἐγώ. ῎Ακουε ῥῆμα Κυρίου· οὐχ οὕτως. Εἶδον τὸν
Κύριον Θεὸν Ἰσραὴλ καθήμενον ἐπὶ τοῦ θρόνου αὐτοῦ, καὶ πᾶσα
ἡ στρατιὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ εἰστήκει περὶ αὐτὸν ἐκ δεξιῶν αὐτοῦ, καὶ
20 ἐξ εὐωνύμων αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος· τίς ἀπατήσει τὸν Ἀχαὰβ
βασιλέα Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ ἀναβήσεται, καὶ πεσεῖται ἐν Ῥεμμὰθ Γα-
21 λαάδ; καὶ εἶπεν οὗτος οὕτως, καὶ οὗτος εἶπεν οὕτως. Καὶ ἐξῆλ-
θε πνεῦμα, καὶ ἔστη ἐνώπιον Κυρίου, καὶ εἶπεν· ἐγὼ ἀπατήσω
22 αὐτόν. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς αὐτόν· ἐν τίνι; Καὶ εἶπεν· ἐξε-
λεύσομαι, καὶ ἔσομαι πνεῦμα ψευδὲς ἐν στόματι πάντων τῶν προ-
φητῶν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπεν· ἀπατήσεις, καί γε δυνήσῃ· ἔξελθε, καὶ
23 ποίησον οὕτως. Καὶ νῦν ἰδοὺ ἔδωκε Κύριος πνεῦμα ψευδὲς ἐν στό-
ματι πάντων τῶν προφητῶν σου τούτων, καὶ Κύριος ἐλάλησεν ἐ-
24 πὶ σὲ κακά. Καὶ προσῆλθε Σεδεκίας υἱὸς Χαναὰ, καὶ ἐπάταξε
τὸν Μιχαίαν ἐπὶ τὴν σιαγόνα, καὶ εἶπε· ποῖον τοῦτο παρῆλθε
25 πνεῦμα Κυρίου παρ᾿ ἐμοῦ, τοῦ λαλῆσαι ἐν σοί; Καὶ εἶπε Μιχαί-
ας· ἰδοὺ σὺ ὕφῃ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, ὅταν εἰσέλθῃς ταμιεῖον τοῦ
26 ταμιείου, τοῦ κρυβῆναι. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἰσραήλ· Λάβετε τὸν
Μιχαίαν, καὶ ἀποστρέψατε αὐτὸν πρὸς Ἀμμὼν τὸν ἄρχοντα τῆς
27 πόλεως, καὶ πρὸς Ἰωὰς υἱὸν τοῦ βασιλέως· καὶ εἶπον· τάδε
λέγει ὁ βασιλεύς· Θέσθε τοῦτον ἐν φυλακῇ, καὶ ἐσθιέτω ἄρτον
θλίψεως, καὶ ὕδωρ θλίψεως, ἕως τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι με ἐν εἰρήνῃ.
28 Καὶ εἶπε Μιχαίας· ἐὰν ἐπιστρέφων ἐπιστρέψῃς ἐν εἰρήνῃ, οὐκ ἐλά-

**Chapter 22**
**(continued)**

**13** ...the prophets do speak good concerning the king, with one mouth; be thou also in thy words as the words of one of these, and speak thou good.
**14** And Micaiah said, "As the Lord liveth, whatsoever the Lord saith unto me, that will I speak."
**15** So he came to the king; and the king said unto him, "Micaiah, shall I go up to Ramoth-Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?" And he answered him, "Go up, and thou shalt prosper; for the Lord shall deliver [it] into the hand of the king."
**16** And the king said unto him, "How many times more shall I adjure thee, that thou speak unto me the truth in the Name of the Lord?"
**17** And he said, "Not so [as I have said]; I have seen all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as a flock that hath no shepherd; and the Lord said, 'There is no lord to these; let every man return unto his house in peace.'"
**18** And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, "Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but only evil?"
**19** And Micaiah said, "Not so; it is not I. Hearken [ye] the word of the Lord; not so. I saw the Lord God of Israel sitting upon His throne, and all the host of heaven stood round about Him, on His right hand and on His left."
**20** And the Lord said, "Who shall deceive Ahab, the king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-Gilead?" And this one said thus, and that one said thus.
**21** And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the Lord, and said, "I will deceive him."
**22** And the Lord said unto him, "Wherewith?" And he said, "I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets." And He said, "Thou shalt deceive [him], and thou shalt indeed prevail; go forth, and do so."
**23** "And now, behold, the Lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the Lord hath spoken evil concerning thee."
**24** Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah drew near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, "Which way went the Spirit of the Lord from me to speak in thee?"
**25** And Micaiah said, "Behold, thou shalt weave in that day, when thou shalt go into a chamber within a chamber, to hide thyself."
**26** And the king of Israel said, "Take Micaiah, and send him back unto Ammon the governor of the city, and unto Joash the king's son;"
**27** And say, "Thus saith the king: Put this man in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction, and with water of affliction, until I return in peace."
**28** And Micaiah said, "If thou return at all in peace, the Lord hath not spoken by me." And he said, "Hearken, all ye people!"
