μὲν τὸ τεῖχος, καὶ πονηρὸν ἦν αὐτῷ, καὶ ὠργίσθη ἐπὶ πολὺ, καὶ
ἐξεγέλα ἐπὶ τοῖς Ἰουδαίοις. Καὶ εἶπεν ἐνώπιον τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐ- 2
τοῦ· αὕτη ἡ δύναμις Σομόρων, ὅτι οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι οὗτοι οἰκοδομοῦσι
τὴν ἑαυτῶν πόλιν; ἄρα θυσιάζουσιν; ἄρα δυνήσονται; καὶ σήμε-
ραγ ἰάσονται τοὺς λίθους, μετὰ τὸ χῶμα γενέσθαι γῆς καυθέντας.
Καὶ Τωβίας ὁ Ἀμμανίτης ἐχόμενα αὐτοῦ ἦλθε, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὖ- 3
τούς· μὴ θυσιάζουσιν ἢ φάγονται ἐπὶ τοῦ τόπου αὐτῶν; οὐχὶ ἀνα-
θήσεται ἀλώπηξ, καὶ καθελεῖ τὸ τεῖχος λίθων αὐτῶν; Ἅκουσον 4
ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν, ὅτι ἐγενήθημεν εἰς μυκτήρισμὸν, καὶ ἐπίστρεφον ὀνει- 5
δισμὸν αὐτῶν εἰς κεφαλὴν αὐτῶν, καὶ δὸς αὐτοὺς εἰς μυκτήρισμὸν
ἐν γῇ αἰχμαλωσίας, καὶ μὴ καλύψῃς ἐπὶ ἀνομίαν. Καὶ ἐγένετο 6.7
ὡς ἤκουσε Σαναβαλλὰτ καὶ Τωβία καὶ οἱ Ἄραβες καὶ οἱ Ἀμμα-
νῖται, ὅτι ἀνέβη ἡ φυγὴ τοῖς τείχεσιν Ἱερουσαλήμ, ὅτι ἤρξαντο αἱ
διασφαγαὶ ἀναφράσσεσθαι, καὶ πονηρὸν αὐτοῖς ἐφάνη σφόδρα. Καὶ 8
συνήχθησαν πάντες ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ, ἐλθεῖν καὶ παρατάξασθαι ἐν Ἱερου-
σαλήμ, καὶ ποιῆσαι αὐτὴν ἀφανῆ. Καὶ προσηυξάμεθα πρὸς τὸν 9
Θεὸν ἡμῶν, καὶ ἐστήσαμεν προφύλακας ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς ἡμέρας καὶ νυ-
κτὸς ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτῶν. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰούδας· συνετρίβη ἡ ἰσχὺς 10
τῶν ἐχθρῶν, καὶ ὁ χοῦς πολὺς, καὶ ἡμεῖς οὐ δυνησόμεθα οἰκοδο-
μεῖν ἐν τῷ τείχει. Καὶ εἶπαν οἱ θλίβοντες ἡμᾶς· οὐ γνώσονται, 11
καὶ οὐκ ὄψονται, ἕως ὅτου ἔλθωμεν εἰς μέσον αὐτῶν, καὶ φονεύ-
σωμεν αὐτοὺς, καὶ καταπαύσωμεν τὸ ἔργον. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἤλ- 12
θοσαν οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι οἱ οἰκοῦντες ἐχόμενα αὐτῶν, καὶ εἶπον ἡμῖν·
ἀναβαίνουσιν ἐκ πάντων τῶν τόπων ἐφ᾽ ἡμᾶς. Καὶ ἔστησα εἰς τὰ 13
κατώτατα τοῦ τόπου κατόπισθεν τοῦ τείχους ἐν τοῖς σκεπνιοῖς,
καὶ ἔστησα τὸν λαὸν κατὰ δήμους μετὰ ῥομφαιῶν ἑαυτῶν, λόγ-
χας αὐτῶν καὶ τόξα ἑαυτῶν. Καὶ ἰδὸν, καὶ ἀνέσχην, καὶ εἶπον πρὸς 14
τοὺς ἐντίμους, καὶ πρὸς τοὺς στρατηγοὺς, καὶ πρὸς τοὺς καταλοί-
πους τοῦ λαοῦ· μὴ φοβηθῆτε ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτῶν, μνήσθητε τοῦ
Θεοῦ ἡμῶν τοῦ μεγάλου καὶ φοβεροῦ, καὶ παρατάξασθε περὶ τῶν
ἀδελφῶν ὑμῶν, υἱῶν ὑμῶν καὶ θυγατέρων ὑμῶν, γυναικῶν ὑμῶν,
καὶ οἴκων ὑμῶν. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἡνίκα ἤκουσαν οἱ ἐχθροὶ ὑμῶν ὅτι 15
ἐγνώσθη ἡμῖν, καὶ διεσκέδασεν ὁ Θεὸς τὴν βουλὴν αὐτῶν· καὶ ἐπ-
εστρέψαμεν πάντες ἡμεῖς εἰς τὸ τεῖχος, ἀνὴρ εἷς τὸ ἔργον αὐτοῦ.
Καὶ ἐγένετο ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέρας ἐκείνης ἥμισυ τῶν ἐκτετιναγμέ- 16
νων ἐποίουν τὸ ἔργον, καὶ ἥμισυ αὐτῶν ἀντείχοντο, καὶ κἀτ-

CHAPTER IV.
[THE SON OF HACHALIAH.]

Now when Sanballat heard that we built the wall, it was evil unto him, and he was greatly wroth, and he scoffed at the Jews.
2 And he spake before his brethren, saying, "What is this strength of the Samaritans, that these Jews do build their own city? Will they offer sacrifice? will they be able [to accomplish it]? And this day-rag, will they restore the stones, after they have become a heap of burnt earth?"
3 And Tobiah the Ammonite, who stood next to him, came and spake unto them, "Will they not offer sacrifice, or eat upon their own place? Will not a fox ascend, and pull down their wall of stones?"
4 Hear, O our God, for we are become a derision;
5 And turn back their reproach upon their own head: yea, give them for a derision in the land of captivity, and cover not over [their] iniquity.
6 Now it came to pass, when Sanballat and Tobiah and the Arabs and the Ammonites heard that the flight had ascended to the walls of Jerusalem, and that the slaughters had begun to be blocked up, that it appeared very evil unto them.
8 And they all gathered themselves together, to come and to draw up in battle array against Jerusalem, and to make it invisible.
9 And we prayed unto our God, and we set guards over them day and night, from their presence.
10 And Judah said, "The strength of the enemies is broken, and the dust is great; and we shall not be able to build on the wall."
11 And those who oppressed us said, "They shall not know, nor shall they see, until we come into their midst, and slay them, and stop the work."
12 And it came to pass, when the Jews who dwelt next to them came, and said unto us, "They are coming up from all places against us."
13 And I set [the people] in the lower parts of the place, behind the wall, in the sheltered places, and I set the people by their clans, with their own swords, their spears, and their own bows.
14 And seeing, and I held forth, and I said unto the nobles, and unto the rulers, and unto the remnant of the people, "Be ye not afraid before their face; remember our God, the great and awesome [one], and fight ye for your brethren, your sons and your daughters, your wives, and your houses."
15 And it came to pass, when your enemies heard that it was known unto us, that God had scattered their counsel. And we all returned unto the wall, each man to his own work.
16 And it came to pass from that day, that half of those who were drawn forth did the work, and half of them held forth, and...
