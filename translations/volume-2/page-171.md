ΚΕΦ. ΙΗʹ. ΙΘʹ. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Γʹ. 647
38 καὶ τὸν χοῦν· καὶ τὸ ὕδωρ τὸ ἐν τῇ θαλάσσῃ ἐξέλειψε τὸ πῦρ.
39 Καὶ εἶδαν πᾶς ὁ λαὸς, καὶ ἔπεσαν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον αὑτῶν, καὶ εἶπαν· ἀληθῶς Κύριος αὐτὸς ἔστιν ὁ Θεός.
40 Καὶ εἶπεν Ἠλιοὺ πρὸς τὸν λαόν· συλλάβετε τοὺς προφήτας τοῦ Βάαλ, μηθεὶς σωθήτω ἐξ αὐτῶν· καὶ συνέλαβον αὐτοὺς καὶ κατάγει αὐτοὺς Ἠλιοὺ εἰς τὸν χειμάρρουν Κεισῶν, καὶ ἔσφαξεν αὐτοὺς ἐκεῖ.
41 Καὶ εἶπεν Ἠλιοὺ πρὸς Ἀχαάβ· ἀνάβηθι, καὶ φάγε, καὶ πίε, ὅτι φωνὴ τῶν ποδῶν τοῦ ὑετοῦ.
42 Καὶ ἀνέβη Ἀχαάβ τοῦ φαγεῖν καὶ πιεῖν· καὶ Ἠλιοὺ ἀνέβη εἰς τὴν κορυφὴν τοῦ Καρμήλου, καὶ ἔκυψεν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, καὶ ἔθηκε πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἀναμέσον τῶν γονάτων αὐτοῦ.
43 Καὶ εἶπε τῷ παιδαρίῳ ἑαυτοῦ· ἀνάβηθι, καὶ ἐπίβλεψον ὁδὸν τῆς θαλάσσης. Καὶ ἀνέβη, καὶ ἐπέβλεψε τὸ παιδάριον, καὶ εἶπεν· οὐκ ἔστιν οὐδέν. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἠλιοὺ· καὶ σὺ ἐπίστρεφον ἑπτάκις.
44 Καὶ ἐπέστρεψε τὸ παιδάριον ἑπτάκις· καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἑβδόμῳ, καὶ ἴδοὺ νεφέλη μικρὰ, ὡς ἴχνος ἀνδρὸς, ἀνάγουσα ὕδωρ· καὶ εἶπεν· ἀνάβηθι, καὶ εἰπὸν τῷ Ἀχαάβ· ζεῦξον τὸ ἅρμα σου, καὶ κατάβηθι, μὴ καταλάβῃ σε ὁ ὑετός.
45 Καὶ ἐγένετο ἕως ὧδε, καὶ ἕως ὧδε, καὶ ὁ οὐρανὸς συνεσκότασε νεφέλαις, καὶ πνεύματι, καὶ ἐγένετο ὁ ὑετὸς μέγας· καὶ ἔκλαιε, καὶ ἐπορεύθη Ἀχαὰβ εἰς Ἰεζράελ.
46 Καὶ χεὶρ Κυρίου ἐγένετο ἐπὶ τὸν Ἠλιοὺ, καὶ συνέσφιγξε τὴν ὀσφῦν αὑτοῦ, καὶ ἔτρεχεν ἔμπροσθεν Ἀχαὰβ τοῦ ἐλθεῖν εἰς Ἰεζράελ.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΘʹ. ΧΙΧ.

1 ΚΑΙ ἀνήγγειλεν Ἀχαὰβ τῇ Ἰεζάβελ γυναικὶ αὑτοῦ πάντα ἃ ἐποίησεν Ἠλιοὺ, καὶ ὡς ἀπέκτεινε πάντας τοὺς προφήτας ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ.
2 Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ἰεζάβελ ἄγγελον πρὸς Ἠλιοὺ, καὶ εἶπεν· εἰ σὺ εἶ Ἠλίας κἀγὼ Ἰεζάβελ, τάδε ποιήσαισάν μοι οἱ θεοὶ, καὶ τάδε προσθείησαν, ὅτι τὴν ὥραν ταύτην αὔριον θήσομαι τὴν ψυχήν σου καθὼς ψυχὴν ἑνὸς ἐξ αὑτῶν.
3 Καὶ ἐφοβήθη Ἠλιοὺ, καὶ ἀνέστη, καὶ ἀπῆλθε κατὰ τὴν ψυχὴν ἑαυτοῦ, καὶ ἔρχεται εἰς Βηρσαβεὲ τὴν Ἰούδα, καὶ ἀφῆκε τὸ παιδάριον αὑτοῦ ἐκεῖ.
4 Καὶ αὐτὸς ἐπορεύθη ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ ὁδὸν ἡμέρας, καὶ ἦλθε, καὶ ἐκάθισεν ὑποκάτω Ῥαθμέν, καὶ ἠτήσατο τὴν ψυχὴν αὑτοῦ ἀποθανεῖν. Καὶ εἶπεν· ἱκανούσθω νῦν, Κύριε, λαβὲ τὴν ψυχήν μου ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ, Κύριε, ὅτι οὐ κρείσσων ἐγὼ εἰμι ὑπὲρ τοὺς πατέρας μου.

**Chapter 18**

**38** —and the dust; and the fire consumed the water that was in the trench.
**39** And when all the people saw [it], they fell upon their faces, and they said, "Verily, the LORD, He is God!"
**40** And Elijah said unto the people, "Seize ye the prophets of Baal; let no one of them escape." And they seized them; and Elijah brought them down unto the torrent Kishon, and slew them there.
**41** And Elijah said unto Ahab, "Go up, eat, and drink; for there is the sound of the footsteps of the rain."
**42** So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up unto the top of Carmel; and he bowed himself down upon the earth, and he put his face between his knees.
**43** And he said unto his servant, "Go up now, [and] look toward the way of the sea." And he went up, and the servant looked, and said, "There is nothing." And Elijah said, "Go again seven times."
**44** And the servant went again seven times; and it came to pass on the seventh [time], behold, a small cloud, as the footprint of a man, rising [and] bearing water. And he said, "Go up, [and] say unto Ahab, 'Harness thy chariot, and get thee down, lest the rain overtake thee.'"
**45** And it came to pass in the space of a moment, that the heaven darkened with clouds and with wind, and there was a great rain; and it rained down heavily, and Ahab went to Jezreel.
**46** And the hand of the LORD was upon Elijah; and He girded up his loins, and he ran before Ahab, until he came to Jezreel.

**Chapter 19**

**1** AND Ahab told Jezebel his wife all things that Elijah had done, and how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.
**2** And Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, and said, "If thou art Elijah, and I am Jezebel, may the gods do so to me, and add yet more [unto it], for by this hour tomorrow I shall make thy life as the life of one of them."
**3** And Elijah was afraid, and he arose, and went away for his life, and came to Beer-sheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there.
**4** But he himself went into the wilderness a day's journey, and came and sat down under a juniper tree; and he requested for his soul to die. And he said, "It is enough now, O LORD; take my life from me, O LORD, for I am not better than my fathers."
