1 ΚΑΙ ἀλλόφυλοι ἐπολέμησαν πρὸς Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ ἔφυγον ἀπὸ
προσώπου ἀλλοφύλων, καὶ ἔπεσον τραυματίαι ἐν ὄρει Γελβουέ.
2 Καὶ κατεδίωξαν ἀλλόφυλοι ὀπίσω Σαούλ, καὶ ὀπίσω υἱῶν αὐτοῦ·
καὶ ἐπάταξαν ἀλλόφυλοι τὸν Ἰωνάθαν, καὶ τὸν Ἀμιναδάβ, καὶ
τὸν Μελχισουέ, υἱοὺς Σαούλ. 3 Καὶ ἐβαρύνθη ὁ πόλεμος ἐπὶ τῷ Σαούλ·
καὶ εὗρον αὐτὸν οἱ τοξόται ἐν τοῖς τόξοις καὶ πόνοις, καὶ ἐπόνε-
σεν ἀπὸ τῶν τόξων. 4 Καὶ εἶπε Σαοὺλ τῷ αἴροντι τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ·
σπάσαι τὴν ῥομφαίαν σου, καὶ ἐκκέντησόν με ἐν αὐτῇ, μὴ ἔλθωσιν
οἱ ἀπερίτμητοι οὗτοι καὶ ἐμπαίξωσι μοι. Καὶ οὐκ ἐβούλετο ὁ αἴ-
ρων τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ, ὅτι ἐφοβεῖτο σφόδρα. Καὶ ἔλαβε Σαοὺλ τὴν
ῥομφαίαν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔπεσεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτήν. 5 Καὶ εἶδεν ὁ αἴρων τὰ σκεύη
αὐτοῦ, ὅτι ἀπέθανε Σαούλ, καὶ ἔπεσε καὶ γε αὐτὸς ἐπὶ τὴν ῥομ-
φαίαν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀπέθανε. 6 Καὶ ἀπέθανε Σαοὺλ, καὶ τρεῖς υἱοὶ
αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ· καὶ πᾶς ὁ οἶκος αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ ἀπέ-
θανε. 7 Καὶ εἶδε πᾶς ἀνὴρ Ἰσραὴλ ὁ ἐν τῷ αὐλῶνι, ὅτι ἔφυγεν Ἰσ-
ραὴλ, καὶ ὅτι ἀπέθανε Σαοὺλ, καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ κατέλιπον
τὰς πόλεις αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔφυγόν· καὶ ἦλθον ἀλλόφυλοι καὶ κατῴκη-

### CHAPTER 9.
**37** and Kish, and Baal, and Ner, and Nadab, and Gedour; and the brethren of Zachour, and Makeloth.
**38** And Makeloth begat Sama. And these dwelt in the midst of their brethren in Hierousalem, even with their brethren.
**39** And Ner begat Kish, and Kish begat Saul, and Saul begat Ionathan, and Melchisoue, and Aminadab, and Baal.
**40** And the son of Ionathan was Mechribaal; and Mechribaal begat Micha.
**41** And the sons of Micha were Phithon, and Malloch, and Thara.
**42** And Chaaz begat Iada. And Iada begat Galemeth, and Azmoth, and Zambri.
**43** And Zambri begat Masa. And Masa begat Raua; and Raphaia was his son, and Eleasa his son, and Esēl his son.
**44** And to Esēl were six sons; and these were their names: Ezrikam his firstborn, and Ishmael, and Saria, and Abdia, and Anan, and Asa. These were the sons of Esēl.

### CHAPTER 10.
**1** Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down wounded upon Mount Gelboue.
**2** And the Philistines pursued after Saul, and after his sons; and the Philistines slew Ionathan, and Aminadab, and Melchisoue, the sons of Saul.
**3** And the battle grew grievous upon Saul; and the archers found him amid the bows and pains, and he was greatly distressed by the bows.
**4** Then said Saul unto his armor-bearer, "Draw forth thy sword, and pierce me therewith, lest these uncircumcised come and mock me." But his armor-bearer would not, for he was sore afraid. Wherefore Saul took his own sword, and fell upon it.
**5** And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell upon his sword, and died.
**6** So Saul died, and his three sons died on that day; and all his house died together.
**7** And when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that Israel had fled, and that Saul was dead, and his sons with him, they forsook their cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt therein.
**8** And it came to pass on the morrow, that the Philistines came to strip the slain, and they found Saul, and his [sons],
