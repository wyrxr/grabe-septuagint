ΚΕΦ. ΙΖʹ. ΙΗʹ.
24 σον καθὼς ἐλάλησας, καὶ πιστωθήτω, καὶ μεγαλυνθήτω τὸ ὄνομά σου ἕως αἰῶνος, λεγόντων· Κύριε, Κύριε παντοκράτωρ, ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ὁ οἶκος Δαυὶδ παιδός σου ἀνωρθωμένος ἐναντίον σου.
25 Ὅτι σὺ, Κύριε, ἤνοιξας τὸ οὖς τοῦ παιδός σου τοῦ οἰκοδομῆσαι αὐτῷ οἶκον, διὰ τοῦτο εὗρεν ὁ παῖς σου τοῦ προσεύξασθαι κατὰ
26 πρόσωπόν σου. Καὶ νῦν, Κύριε, σὺ εἶ αὐτὸς ὁ Θεός, καὶ ἐλάλησας
27 ἐπὶ τὸν δοῦλόν σου τὰ ἀγαθὰ ταῦτα. Καὶ νῦν ἤρξω τοῦ εὐλογῆσαι τὸν οἶκον τοῦ παιδός σου, τοῦ εἶναι εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα ἐναντίον σου· ὅτι σὺ, Κύριε, εὐλόγησας, καὶ εὐλόγησον εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΗʹ. XVIII.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο μετὰ ταῦτα, καὶ ἐπάταξε Δαυὶδ τοὺς ἀλλοφύλους, καὶ ἐτροπώσατο αὐτούς, καὶ ἔλαβε τὴν Γὲθ, καὶ τὰς χώρας αὐτῆς ἐκ χειρὸς ἀλλοφύλων.
2 Καὶ ἐπάταξε τὴν Μωὰβ, καὶ ἦσαν Μωαβῖται παῖδες τῷ Δαυὶδ φέροντες δῶρα.
3 Καὶ ἐπάταξε Δαυὶδ τὸν Ἀδρααζὰρ βασιλέα Σουβὰ Ἡμὰθ, πορευομένου αὐτοῦ ἐπιστῆσαι χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ ποταμὸν Εὐφράτην.
4 Καὶ προκατελάβετο Δαυὶδ αὐτῷ χίλια ἅρματα, καὶ ἑπτὰ χιλιάδας ἵππων, καὶ εἴκοσι χιλιάδας ἀνδρῶν πεζῶν. Καὶ παρέλυσε Δαυὶδ πάντα τὰ ἅρματα, καὶ ὑπελείπετο ἐξ αὐτῶν ἑκατὸν ἅρματα.
5 Καὶ ἦλθε Σύρος ἐκ Δαμασκοῦ βοηθῆσαι Ἀδρααζὰρ βασιλεῖ Σουβὰ, καὶ ἐπάταξε Δαυὶδ ἐν τῷ Σύρῳ εἴκοσι καὶ δύο χιλιάδας ἀνδρῶν.
6 Καὶ ἔθετο Δαυὶδ φρουρὰν ἐν Συρίᾳ τῇ κατὰ Δαμασκὸν, καὶ ἦσαν τῷ Δαυὶδ εἰς παῖδας φέροντας δῶρα. Καὶ ἔσωζε Κύριος τὸν Δαυὶδ ἐν πᾶσιν οἷς ἐπορεύετο.
7 Καὶ ἔλαβε Δαυὶδ τοὺς κλοιοὺς τοὺς χρυσοὺς οἳ ἦσαν ἐπὶ τοὺς παῖδας Ἀδρααζὰρ, καὶ ἤνεγκεν αὐτοὺς εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ.
8 Καὶ ἐκ τῆς Ματεβὴθ, καὶ ἐκ τῶν ἐκλεκτῶν πόλεων τῶν Ἀδρααζὰρ ἔλαβε Δαυὶδ χαλκὸν πολὺν σφόδρα· ἐξ αὐτοῦ ἐποίησε Σαλωμὼν τὴν θάλασσαν τὴν χαλκῆν, καὶ τοὺς στύλους, καὶ τὰ σκεύη τὰ χαλκᾶ.
9 Καὶ ἤκουσε Θοοῦ βασιλεὺς Ἡμὰθ, ὅτι ἐπάταξε Δαυὶδ
10 τὴν πᾶσαν δύναμιν Ἀδρααζὰρ βασιλέως Σουβὰ· καὶ ἀπέστειλε τὸν Ἀδουρὰμ υἱὸν αὐτοῦ πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Δαυὶδ, τοῦ ἐρωτῆσαι αὐτὸν τὰ εἰς εἰρήνην, καὶ τοῦ εὐλογῆσαι αὐτὸν ὑπὲρ οὗ ἐπολέμησε τὸν Ἀδρααζὰρ, καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτὸν, ὅτι ἀνὴρ πολέμιος Θοοῦ ἦν τῷ Ἀδρααζὰρ· καὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη χρυσᾶ, καὶ ἀργυρᾶ, καὶ χαλ-

**24** ...act as Thou hast spoken, and let it be established, and let Thy Name be magnified for ever, while men declare, "The Lord, the Lord Almighty, is the God of Israel; and the house of David Thy servant is established before Thee."
**25** For Thou, O Lord, hast opened the ear of Thy servant, that Thou wouldst build him a house; therefore hath Thy servant found [it in his heart] to pray before Thy face.
**26** And now, O Lord, Thou art that God Himself, and Thou hast spoken these good things concerning Thy servant.
**27** And now Thou hast begun to bless the house of Thy servant, that it may be before Thee for ever; for Thou, O Lord, hast blessed [it], and [therefore] bless it for ever.

**Chapter 18**

**1** And it came to pass after these things, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them; and he took Gath, and her towns from the hand of the Philistines.
**2** And he smote Moab, and the Moabites became servants to David, bringing gifts.
**3** And David smote Hadarezer, king of Zobah of Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates.
**4** And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen. And David disabled all the chariots, but reserved from them an hundred chariots.
**5** And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David smote of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.
**6** And David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus, and the Syrians became servants to David, bringing gifts. And the Lord preserved David whithersoever he went.
**7** And David took the golden shields which were upon the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
**8** And from Tibhath, and from the choice cities of Hadarezer, David took exceeding much brass; from it Solomon made the brazen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.
**9** Now when Tou king of Hamath heard
**10** that David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah, he sent Hadoram his son to King David, to enquire of him concerning peace, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadarezer and smitten him; for Hadarezer had been at war with Tou. And he sent all manner of vessels of gold, and of silver, and of brass.
