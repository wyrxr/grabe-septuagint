ἐν τῇ περιοχῇ, καὶ ἐκλήθη αὕτη ἡ πόλις Δαυίδ. Καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν αὐτὴν πόλιν κύκλῳ ἀπὸ τῆς ἄκρας, καὶ τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ.
Καὶ ἐπορεύετο Δαυίδ πορευόμενος καὶ μεγαλυνόμενος, καὶ Κύριος 10
ὁ Θεὸς ὁ παντοκράτωρ μετ’ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἀπέστειλε Χειρὰμ βα- 11
σιλεὺς Τύρου ἀγγέλους πρὸς Δαυίδ, καὶ ξύλα κεδρίνα, καὶ τέκτονας ξύλων, καὶ τέκτονας λίθων τοίχου· καὶ ᾠκοδόμησαν οἶκον
τῷ Δαυίδ. Καὶ ἔγνω Δαυίδ, ὅτι ἡτοίμασεν αὐτὸν Κύριος εἰς βα- 12
σιλέα ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ὅτι ἐπήρθη ἡ βασιλεία αὐτοῦ διὰ τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἔλαβε Δαυίδ ἔτι παλλακὰς καὶ γυναῖκας ἐξ Ἱερουσαλὴμ μετὰ τὸ ἐλθεῖν αὐτὸν ἐκ Χεβρών· καὶ ἐγένοντο ἔτι τῷ Δαυίδ υἱοὶ καὶ θυγατέρες. Καὶ ταῦτα τὰ ὀνόματα 14
τῶν γεννηθέντων αὐτῷ ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ· Σαμμουέ, καὶ Σωβάβ, καὶ
Νάθαν, καὶ Σαλωμών, καὶ Ἰεβάδ, καὶ Ἑλισουέ, καὶ Ναφέχ, καὶ 15
Ἰαφιέ, 16 καὶ Ἐλισαμά, καὶ Ἐλιδαέ, καὶ Ἐλιφαλάθ. Καὶ ἤκου- 17
σαν ἀλλόφυλοι ὅτι κέχρισται Δαυίδ βασιλεὺς ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἀνέβησαν πάντες οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι ζητεῖν τὸν Δαυίδ. Καὶ ἤκουσε Δαυίδ
καὶ κατέβη εἰς τὴν περιοχήν. Καὶ οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι παραγίνονται, καὶ 18
συνέπεσαν εἰς τὴν κοιλάδα τῶν Τιτάνων. Καὶ ἠρώτησε Δαυίδ διὰ 19
Κυρίου, λέγων· εἰ ἀναβῶ πρὸς τοὺς ἀλλοφύλους, καὶ παραδώσεις αὐτοὺς εἰς τὰς χεῖράς μου; καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Δαυίδ·
ἀνάβαινε, ὅτι παραδιδοὺς παραδώσω τοὺς ἀλλοφύλους εἰς τὰς χειράς σου. Καὶ ἦλθε Δαυίδ ἐκ τῶν ἐπάνω διακοπῶν, καὶ διέκοψε 20
τοὺς ἀλλοφύλους ἐκεῖ, καὶ Δαυίδ εἶπε· διέκοψε Κύριος τοὺς ἐχθρούς μου τοὺς ἀλλοφύλους ἐνώπιον ἐμοῦ, ὡς διακόπτεται ὕδατα·
διὰ τοῦτο ἐκλήθη τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ τόπου ἐκείνου, Ἐπάνω διακοπῶν.
Καὶ καταλιμπάνουσι ἐκεῖ τοὺς θεοὺς αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔλαβε Δαυίδ αὐ- 21
τοὺς, καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες οἱ μετ’ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ προσέθεντο ἔτι ἀλλό- 22
φυλοι τοῦ ἀναβῆναι καὶ συνέπεσαν ἐν τῇ κοιλάδι τῶν Τιτάνων.
Καὶ ἐπηρώτησε Δαυίδ διὰ Κυρίου· καὶ εἶπε Κύριος· οὐκ ἀναβήσῃ 23
εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτῶν, ἀποστρέφου ἀπ’ αὐτῶν, καὶ περιπεσῇ αὐτοῖς πλησίον τοῦ κλαυθμῶνος. Καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῷ ἀκοῦσαί σε τὴν 24
φωνὴν τοῦ συγκλεισμοῦ τοῦ ἄλσους τοῦ κλαυθμῶνος, τότε καταβήσῃ πρὸς αὐτοὺς, ὅτι τότε ἐξελεύσεται Κύριος ἔμπροσθέν σου κόπτειν ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ τῶν ἀλλοφύλων. Καὶ ἐποίησε Δαυίδ καθὼς 25
ἐνετείλατο αὐτῷ Κύριος, καὶ ἐπάταξε τοὺς ἀλλοφύλους ἀπὸ Γαβαὼν ἕως τῆς γῆς Γαζηρά.

### Chapter 5

**9** And David dwelt in the stronghold, and it was called the City of David. And he built the city round about from the citadel, and [he built] his house.
**10** And David went on, waxing greater and greater; and the LORD God Almighty was with him.
**11** And Hiram, king of Tyre, sent messengers unto David, and cedar timbers, and carpenters of wood, and masons of wall stones; and they built a house for David.
**12** And David knew that the LORD had appointed him as king over Israel, and that his kingdom was exalted for the sake of His people Israel.
**13** And David took yet more concubines and wives from Jerusalem, after he came from Hebron; and unto David were yet more sons and daughters born.
**14** And these are the names of those born unto him in Jerusalem: Sammuae, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon, and Iebaad, and Elisoue, and Naphech,
**15** and Iaphie,
**16** and Elisama, and Elidae, and Eliphalath.
**17** And the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over Israel, and all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard [of it], and went down to the stronghold.
**18** And the Philistines came, and deployed themselves in the Valley of the Titans.
**19** And David inquired of the Lord, saying, "Shall I go up against the Philistines, and wilt Thou deliver them into mine hands?" And the Lord said unto David, "Go up; for I will surely deliver the Philistines into thine hands."
**20** And David came from the Upper Breaches, and broke the Philistines there. And David said, "The Lord hath broken mine enemies the Philistines before me, as waters are broken forth." Therefore the name of that place was called, Upper Breaches.
**21** And they left their gods there, and David took them, and the men who were with him.
**22** And the Philistines added yet again to come up, and deployed themselves in the Valley of the Titans.
**23** And David inquired of the Lord. And the Lord said, "Thou shalt not go up to meet them; turn thee away from them, and thou shalt fall upon them near the place of weeping."
**24** "And it shall be, when thou shalt hear the sound of the closing-in of the grove of weeping, then thou shalt go down against them, for then shall the Lord go out before thee to strike in the battle of the Philistines."
**25** And David did as the Lord commanded him, and he smote the Philistines from Gibeon even unto the land of Gazera.
