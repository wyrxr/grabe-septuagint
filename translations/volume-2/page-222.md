ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Δʹ. ΚΕΦ. ΙΗʹ.
15 τριακόσια τάλαντα ἀργυρίου, καὶ τριάκοντα τάλαντα χρυσίου.
16 Καὶ ἔδωκεν Ἑζεκίας πᾶν τὸ ἀργύριον τὸ εὑρεθὲν ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου, καὶ ἐν θησαυροῖς οἴκου τοῦ βασιλέως. Ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ συνέκοψεν Ἑζεκίας τὰς θύρας ναοῦ Κυρίου, καὶ τὰ ἐστηριγμένα ἃ ἐχρύσωσεν Ἑζεκίας βασιλεὺς Ἰούδα, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὰ βασιλεῖ Ἀσσυρίων.
17 Καὶ ἀπέστειλε βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων τὸν Θαρθαν, καὶ τὸν Ῥαβσαρεῖς, καὶ τὸν Ῥαψάκην ἐκ Λαχεὶς πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Ἑζεκίαν ἐν δυνάμει βαρείᾳ ἐπὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ.
18 Καὶ ἀνέβησαν, καὶ ἦλθον εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἔστησαν ἐν τῷ ὑδραγωγῷ τῆς κολυμβήθρας τῆς ἄνω, ἥ ἐστιν ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ τοῦ ἀγροῦ τοῦ γναφέως. Καὶ ἐβόησαν πρὸς Ἑζεκίαν, καὶ ἦλθον πρὸς αὐτὸν Ἑλιακεὶμ ὁ υἱὸς Χελκίου ὁ οἰκονόμος, καὶ Σομνὰς ὁ γραμματεύς, καὶ Ἰωὰς ὁ υἱὸς Σαφὰτ ὁ ἀναμιμνήσκων.
19 Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτοὺς Ῥαψάκης· εἴπατε δὴ πρὸς Ἑζεκίαν· τάδε λέγει ὁ βασιλεὺς ὁ μέγας, βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων.
20 Τίς ἡ πεποίθησις αὕτη ἣν πέποιθας; Εἶπας· πλὴν λόγοι χειλέων, βουλὴ καὶ δύναμις εἰς πόλεμον· καὶ νῦν τίνι πεποιθὼς ἠθέτησας ἐν ἐμοί;
21 Νῦν ἰδοὺ πέποιθας σαυτῷ ἐπὶ τὴν ῥάβδον τὴν καλαμίνην τὴν τεθλασμένην ταύτην, ἐπ᾽ Αἴγυπτον; ὃς ἂν στηριχθῇ ἀνὴρ ἐπ᾽ αὐτήν, καὶ εἰσελεύσεται εἰς τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ, καὶ τρυπήσει αὐτήν. οὕτως Φαραὼ βασιλεὺς Αἰγύπτου πᾶσι τοῖς πεποιθόσιν ἐπ᾽ αὐτόν.
22 Καὶ ὅτι εἶπας πρὸς μέ, ἐπὶ Κύριον Θεὸν πεποίθαμεν· οὐχὶ αὐτὸς (οὗτος) ὁ ἀπέστησεν Ἑζεκίας τὰ ὑψηλὰ αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰ θυσιαστήρια αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπε τῷ Ἰούδα, καὶ τῇ Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐνώπιον τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου τούτου προσκυνήσετε ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ;
23 Καὶ νῦν μίχθητε δὴ τῷ κυρίῳ μου, τῷ βασιλεῖ Ἀσσυρίων, καὶ δώσω σοι δισχιλίους ἵππους, εἰ δυνήσῃ δοῦναι σαυτῷ ἐπιβάτας ἐπ᾽ αὐτούς.
24 Καὶ πῶς ἀποστρέψεις τὸ πρόσωπον τοπάρχου ἑνὸς τῶν δούλων τοῦ κυρίου μου τῶν ἐλαχίστων; καὶ ἤλπισας σαυτῷ ἐπ᾽ Αἴγυπτον εἰς ἅρματα καὶ ἱππεῖς;
25 Νῦν οὖν μὴ ἄνευ Κυρίου ἀνέβημεν ἐπὶ τὸν τόπον τοῦτον τοῦ διαφθεῖραι αὐτόν· Κύριος εἶπε πρὸς μέ, ἀνάβηθι ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ταύτην, καὶ διάφθειρον αὐτήν. Καὶ εἶπεν.
26 Ἑλιακεὶμ υἱὸς Χελκίου, καὶ Σομνάς, καὶ Ἰωὰς πρὸς Ῥαψάκην · λάλησον δὴ πρὸς τοὺς παῖδάς σου Συριστί, ὅτι ἀκούομεν ἡμεῖς, καὶ οὐ λαλήσεις πρὸς ἡμᾶς Ἰουδαϊστὶ ἐν τοῖς ὠσὶ τοῦ λαοῦ τοῦ ἐπὶ τοῦ τείχους.
27 Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτοὺς Ῥαψάκης· μὴ πρὸς τὸν κύριόν σου, καὶ πρὸς σὲ ἀπέστειλέ με ὁ κύριός μου λαλῆσαι τοὺς λόγους τούτους;

### Literary Translation:

### 2 Kings 18

**15** ...three hundred talents of silver, and thirty talents of gold.
**16** And Hezekiah gave all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasuries of the king's house. In that time, Hezekiah stripped the doors of the temple of the LORD, and the doorposts which Hezekiah, king of Judah, had overlaid with gold, and gave them to the king of Assyria.
**17** And the king of Assyria sent Tartan, and Rab-saris, and Rabshakeh from Lachish to King Hezekiah with a great army against Jerusalem.
**18** And they went up, and came to Jerusalem, and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller's field. And they cried out to Hezekiah; and there came forth to them Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Shaphat, the recorder.
**19** And Rabshakeh said unto them, "Say now to Hezekiah, 'Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria:
**20** What confidence is this wherein thou trustest? Thou sayest, [but these are] but words of lips, [that there is] counsel and strength for war. And now, in whom dost thou trust, that thou hast rebelled against me?'"
**21** "Now, behold, thou trustest in thyself upon this broken reed-staff, upon Egypt? If a man lean upon it, it shall go into his hand, and pierce it. So is Pharaoh, king of Egypt, unto all that trust in him."
**22** "And if thou sayest unto me, 'We trust in the LORD our God': is it not he, even this Hezekiah, who hath removed His high places and His altars, and hath said to Judah and Jerusalem, 'Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem'?"
**23** "And now, make a pledge, I pray thee, to my lord, the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them."
**24** "And how then wilt thou turn away the face of one governor, even of the least of my master's servants? And dost thou hope in thyself for Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?"
**25** "Now, therefore, have we not come up without the LORD against this place to destroy it? The LORD said unto me, 'Go up against this land, and destroy it.'" And he said:
**26** Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah, said unto Rabshakeh, "Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian tongue, for we understand it; and speak not to us in the Jews' language in the ears of the people that are on the wall."
**27** And Rabshakeh said unto them, "Hath my master sent me [only] unto thy master, and unto thee, to speak these words?"
