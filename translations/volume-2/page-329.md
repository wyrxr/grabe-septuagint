ΚΕΦ. ΚΕ΄. ΤΩΝ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ ΙΟΥΔΑ Β΄.
Ἀμασίας τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ τοῦ Θεοῦ· καὶ τί ποιήσω τὰ ἑκατὸν τάλαν-
τα ἃ ἔδωκα τῇ δυνάμει Ἰσραήλ; Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ ἄνθρωπος τοῦ Θεοῦ·
ἔστι τῷ Κυρίῳ δοῦναί σοι πλεῖστα τούτων. Καὶ διεχώρισεν Ἀμα-
σίας τῇ δυνάμει τῇ ἐλθούσῃ πρὸς αὐτὸν ἀπὸ Ἐφραίμ, ἀπελθεῖν εἰς
τὸν τόπον ἑαυτῶν. Καὶ ἐθυμώθησαν σφόδρα ἐπὶ Ἰούδαν, καὶ ὑπ-
έστρεψαν εἰς τὸν τόπον ἑαυτῶν ἐν ὀργῇ θυμοῦ. Καὶ Ἀμασίας κατ-
ίσχυσε, καὶ παρέλαβε τὸν λαὸν ἑαυτοῦ, καὶ ἐπορεύθη εἰς τὴν κοι-
λάδα τῶν ἁλῶν, καὶ ἐπάταξεν ἐκεῖ τοὺς υἱοὺς Σηείρ, δέκα χιλιά-
δας· καὶ δέκα χιλιάδας ἐζώγρησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰούδα, καὶ ἔφερον αὐ-
τοὺς ἐπὶ τὸ ἄκρον τοῦ κρημνοῦ, καὶ κατεκρήμνιζον αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ τοῦ
ἄκρου τοῦ κρημνοῦ, καὶ πάντες διερρήγνυντο. Καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ τῆς δυ-
νάμεως οὓς ἀπέστρεψεν Ἀμασίας τοῦ μὴ πορευθῆναι μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ
εἰς πόλεμον, καὶ ἐπέθεντο ἐπὶ τὰς πόλεις Ἰούδα ἀπὸ Σαμαρείας
ἕως Βαιθωρών· καὶ ἐπάταξαν ἐν αὐτοῖς τρεῖς χιλιάδας, καὶ ἐσκύ-
λευσαν σκῦλα πολλά. Καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ τὸ ἐλθεῖν Ἀμασίαν πα-
τάξαντα τὴν Ἰδουμαίαν, καὶ ἤνεγκε πρὸς αὐτοὺς τοὺς θεοὺς υἱῶν
Σηείρ, καὶ ἔστησεν αὐτοὺς ἑαυτῷ εἰς θεούς, καὶ ἐναντίον αὐτῶν
προσεκύνει, καὶ αὐτοῖς αὐτὸς ἔθυε. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὀργὴ Κυρίου ἐπὶ
Ἀμασίαν, καὶ ἀπέστειλεν αὐτῷ προφήτην, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· τί ἐζή-
τησας τοὺς θεοὺς τοῦ λαοῦ, οἳ οὐκ ἐξείλαντο τὸν λαὸν ἑαυτῶν ἐκ
χειρός σου; Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ λαλῆσαι αὐτῷ πρὸς αὐτόν, καὶ
εἶπεν αὐτῷ· μὴ σύμβουλον τοῦ βασιλέως δέδωκά σε; πρόσεχε ἵνα
μὴ μαστιγωθῇς· καὶ ἐσιώπησεν ὁ προφήτης, καὶ εἶπεν· ὅτι γινώ-
σκω, ὅτι ἐβούλετο ἐπὶ σοὶ τοῦ καταφθεῖραί σε, ὅτι ἐποίησας τοῦ-
το, καὶ οὐκ ἐπήκουσας τῆς συμβουλίας μου. Καὶ ἐβουλεύσατο Ἀ-
μασίας ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἰούδα, καὶ ἀπέστειλε πρὸς Ἰωὰς υἱὸν Ἰωάχαζ
υἱοῦ Ἰηοῦ βασιλέα Ἰσραήλ, λέγων· δεῦρο, ὀφθῶμεν προσώποις.
Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ἰωὰς βασιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς Ἀμασίαν βασιλέα
Ἰούδα, λέγων· ὁ Ἄκανθος ὁ ἐν τῷ Λιβάνῳ ἀπέστειλε πρὸς τὴν κέ-
δρον τὴν ἐν τῷ Λιβάνῳ, λέγων· δὸς τὴν θυγατέρα σου τῷ υἱῷ μου
εἰς γυναῖκα, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐλεύσεται τὰ θηρία τοῦ ἀγροῦ τὰ ἐν τῷ Λι-
βάνῳ· καὶ ἦλθαν τὰ θηρία, καὶ κατεπάτησαν τὸν Ἄκανθον. Εἶπας,
ἰδοὺ ἐπάταξας τὴν Ἰδουμαίαν, καὶ ἐπαίρει σε ἡ καρδία σου ἡ βα-
ρεῖα, νῦν κάθησο ἐν οἴκῳ σου, καὶ ἵνατί συμβάλλεις ἐν κακίᾳ, καὶ
πεσῇ σύ, καὶ Ἰούδας μετὰ σοῦ; Καὶ οὐκ ἤκουσεν Ἀμασίας, ὅτι
παρὰ Κυρίου ἐγένετο τοῦ παραδοῦναι αὐτὸν εἰς χεῖρας, ὅτι ἐξεζή-

#### CHAPTER XXV. [CONTINUED]

⁹ And Amaziah said unto the man of God, “What then shall I do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel?” And the man of God said, “The Lord is able to give thee much more than these.”

¹⁰ Then Amaziah separated the army that had come to him from Ephraim, to depart unto their own place. And they were exceeding wroth against Judah, and returned to their own place in the wrath of [their] fury.

¹¹ And Amaziah took courage, and led forth his own people, and went to the Valley of Salt, and there he smote the sons of Seir, ten thousand [men].

¹² And ten thousand [more] did the sons of Judah take alive, and brought them to the top of a rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, so that all of them were broken in pieces.

¹³ Now the sons of the host whom Amaziah had sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Beth-horon, and smote in them three thousand [men], and took much spoil.

¹⁴ And it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from smiting the Edomites, that he brought unto them the gods of the sons of Seir, and set them up to him for gods, and before them he bowed himself down, and unto them he himself offered sacrifice.

¹⁵ And the wrath of the Lord was kindled against Amaziah, and He sent unto him a prophet, and said unto him, “Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which have not delivered their own people out of thy hand?”

¹⁶ And it came to pass, as he spake with him, that he said unto him, “Have I made thee a counselor of the king? Take heed lest thou be smitten!” And the prophet held his peace, and said, “For I know that [the Lord] hath purposed to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.”

¹⁷ Then Amaziah king of Judah took counsel, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, “Come, let us look one another in the face.”

¹⁸ And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, “The Thornbush that was in Lebanon sent to the Cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give thy daughter to my son to wife.’ And behold, the beasts of the field that were in Lebanon came, and trampled down the Thornbush.”

¹⁹ “Thou hast said, ‘Behold, thou hast smitten Edom,’ and thy heavy heart lifteth thee up. Now abide in thine house, and why wilt thou contend in evil, that thou shouldest fall, both thou, and Judah with thee?”

²⁰ But Amaziah would not hear; for it was of the Lord, that He might deliver him into [the] hands [of his enemies], because he had sought after...
