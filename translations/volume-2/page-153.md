Ἰσραήλ. Ἀνθ᾿ ὧν κατέλιπέ με, καὶ ἐποίησε τῇ Ἀστάρτῃ βδελύγματι 33
Σιδωνίων, καὶ τῷ Χαμὼς, καὶ τοῖς εἰδώλοις Μωὰβ, καὶ τῷ βασιλεῖ
αὐτῶν προσοχθίσματι υἱῶν Ἀμμὼν· καὶ οὐκ ἐπορεύθη ἐνώπιον Κυρίου
ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς μου, τοῦ ποιῆσαι τὸ εὐθὲς ἐνώπιον ἐμοῦ, καὶ διακριβείας
μου, καὶ κρίσεις μου, ὡς Δαυὶδ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ οὐ μὴ λάβω 34
ὅλην τὴν βασιλείαν ἐκ χειρὸς αὐτοῦ, διότι ἀντιτασσόμενος ἀντιτάξομαι
αὐτῷ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς ζωῆς αὐτοῦ, διὰ Δαυὶδ τὸν δοῦλόν μου, ὃν
ἐξελεξάμην αὐτὸν, ὃς ἐφύλαξεν ἐντολάς μου, καὶ ἀκριβασμόν. Καὶ 35
λήψομαι τὴν βασιλείαν ἐκ χειρὸς τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ δώσω σοι τὰ δέκα
σκῆπτρα. Τῷ δὲ υἱῷ αὐτοῦ δώσω δύο σκῆπτρα, ὅπως ᾖ θέσις τῷ 36
δούλῳ μου Δαυὶδ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας ἐνώπιον ἐμοῦ ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ
τῇ πόλει, ἣν ἐξελεξάμην ἐμαυτῷ τοῦ θέσθαι τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐκεῖ. Καὶ 37
σὺ λήψῃ, καὶ βασιλεύσεις ἐν οἷς ἐπιθυμεῖ ἡ ψυχή σου, καὶ σὺ ἔσῃ
βασιλεὺς ἐπὶ τὸν Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἔσται ἐὰν φυλάξῃς πάντα ὅσα ἂν 38
ἐντείλωμαί σοι, καὶ πορευθῇς ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς μου, καὶ ποιήσεις τὸ εὐθὲς
ἐνώπιον ἐμοῦ, φυλάξασθαι τὰς ἐντολάς μου, καὶ τὰ προστάγματά μου,
καθὼς ἐποίησε Δαυὶδ ὁ δοῦλός μου, καὶ ἔσομαί μετὰ σοῦ, καὶ οἰκοδομήσω
οἶκον πιστὸν, καθὼς ᾠκοδόμησα τῷ Δαυὶδ, καὶ δώσω σοι τὸν Ἰσραήλ.
Καὶ κακουχήσω τὸ σπέρμα Δαυὶδ διὰ ταύτην, πλὴν οὐ πάσας τὰς 39
ἡμέρας. Καὶ ἐζήτησε Σαλωμὼν θανατῶσαι τὸν Ἱεροβοάμ. Καὶ 40
ἀνέστη Ἱεροβοὰμ, καὶ ἀπέδρα εἰς Αἴγυπτον πρὸς Σουσακεὶμ βασιλέα
Αἰγύπτου, καὶ ἦν ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ ἕως οὗ ἀπέθανε Σαλωμών. Καὶ τὰ 41
λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Σαλωμὼν καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησε, καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν
φρόνησιν αὐτοῦ, οὐκ ἰδοὺ ταῦτα γεγραμμένα ἐν βιβλίῳ ῥημάτων
Σαλωμὼν; Καὶ αἱ ἡμέραι ἃς ἐβασίλευσε Σαλωμὼν ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ 42
ἐπὶ πάντα Ἰσραὴλ τεσσαράκοντα ἔτη. Καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Σαλωμὼν 43
μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν ἐν πόλει Δαυὶδ τοῦ πατρὸς
αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐβασίλευσε Ῥοβοὰμ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΒ΄. ΧΙΙ.

ΚΑΙ πορεύεται ὁ βασιλεὺς Ῥοβοὰμ εἰς Σίκιμα, ἔτι εἰς Σίκιμα ἤρχετο 1
πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ βασιλεῦσαι αὐτόν. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἤκουεν Ἱεροβοὰμ 2
υἱὸς Ναβὰτ, καὶ αὐτοῦ ἔτι ὄντος ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ

**33** Because that he hath forsaken Me, and hath worshipped Ashtoreth, the abomination of the Sidonians, and Chemosh, and the idols of Moab, and their king, the detestable thing of the sons of Ammon; and hath not walked before the Lord in My ways, to do that which is right in My sight, even My exact statutes, and My judgments, as David his father.

**34** Yet will I not take the whole kingdom out of his hand, for I will surely set Myself against him all the days of his life, for David My servant’s sake, whom I chose, even him, who kept My commandments, and My ordinances.

**35** And I will take the kingdom out of the hand of his son, and will give unto thee ten scepters [tribes].

**36** But unto his son will I give two scepters [tribes], that there may be a lasting establishment for My servant David all the days before Me in Jerusalem the city, which I have chosen for Myself to place My Name there.

**37** And thou shalt receive, and shalt reign over all that thy soul desireth, and thou shalt be king over Israel.

**38** And it shall be, if thou wilt keep all things whatsoever I shall command thee, and walk in My ways, and do that which is right in My sight, to keep My commandments, and My statutes, as David My servant did, then will I be with thee, and will build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and will give unto thee Israel.

**39** And I will afflict the seed of David for this [cause], but not perpetually.

**40** And Solomon sought to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt unto Shishak the king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until Solomon died.

**41** And the rest of the words of Solomon, and all that he did, and all his wisdom, are not these things written in the book of the words of Solomon?

**42** And the days which Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel were forty years.

**43** And Solomon slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David his father, and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.

### CHAPTER XII

**1** And King Rehoboam went unto Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem, yea, unto Shechem, to make him king.

**2** And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard [of it], (for he was yet in Egypt).
