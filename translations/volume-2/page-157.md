ΚΕΦ. ΙΓ´. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Γ´. 633
τοῦ Θεοῦ· δεήθητι τοῦ προσώπου Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ σου, καὶ πρόσευξαι περὶ ἐμοῦ, καὶ ἐπιστρεψάτω ἡ χείρ μου πρὸς με. Καὶ ἐδεήθη ὁ ἄνθρωπος τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ προσώπου Κυρίου, καὶ ἐπέστρεψε τὴν χεῖρα τοῦ βασιλέως πρὸς αὐτόν, καὶ ἐγένετο καθὼς πρότερον. Καὶ ἐλάλησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς πρὸς τὸν ἄνθρωπον τοῦ Θεοῦ· 7
εἴσελθε μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ εἰς οἶκον, καὶ ἀρίστησον, καὶ δώσω σοι δόμα.
Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ ἄνθρωπος τοῦ Θεοῦ πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα· ἐὰν δῷς μοι 8
τὸ ἥμισυ τοῦ οἴκου σου, οὐκ εἰσελεύσομαι μετὰ σοῦ, οὐδὲ μὴ φάγω
ἄρτον, οὐδὲ μὴ πίω ὕδωρ ἐν τῷ τόπῳ τούτῳ. Ὅτι οὕτως ἐνε- 9
τείλατό μοι ἐν λόγῳ Κύριος, λέγων· Μὴ φάγῃς ἄρτον, καὶ μὴ πίῃς ὕδωρ, καὶ μὴ ἐπιστρέψῃς ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ ᾗ ἐπορεύθης ἐν αὐτῇ. Καὶ 10
ἀπῆλθεν ἐν ὁδῷ ἄλλῃ, καὶ οὐκ ἀνέστρεψεν ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ ᾗ ἦλθεν ἐν
αὐτῇ εἰς Βαιθήλ. Καὶ προφήτης εἷς πρεσβύτης κατώκει ἐν Βαιθήλ, 11
καὶ ἔρχονται οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ διηγήσαντο αὐτῷ πάντα τὰ ἔργα ἃ ἐποίησεν ὁ ἄνθρωπος τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐν Βαιθήλ, τοὺς λόγους οὓς ἐλάλησε τῷ βασιλεῖ, καὶ ἀπέστρεψαν τὸ πρόσωπον τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐλάλησε πρὸς αὐτοὺς ὁ πατὴρ αὐτῶν, λέγων· ποία 12
ὁδῷ πεπόρευται; καὶ δεικνύουσιν αὐτῷ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ τὴν ὁδὸν ἐν ᾗ
ἀπῆλθεν ὁ ἄνθρωπος τοῦ Θεοῦ ὁ ἐξελθὼν ἐξ Ἰούδα. Καὶ εἶπε τοῖς 13
υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ· ἐπισάξατέ μοι τὴν ὄνον· καὶ ἐπέσαξαν αὐτῷ τὴν ὄνον,
καὶ ἐπέβη ἐπ᾿ αὐτήν. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη κατόπισθεν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τοῦ 14
Θεοῦ, καὶ εὗρεν αὐτὸν καθήμενον ὑπὸ δρῦν, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· εἰ σὺ εἶ ὁ ἄνθρωπος τοῦ Θεοῦ ὁ ἐληλυθὼς ἐξ Ἰούδα; καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ·
ἐγώ. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· δεῦρο μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν, καὶ φάγε 15
ἄρτον. Καὶ εἶπεν· οὐ μὴ δύνωμαι τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι μετὰ σοῦ, οὐδὲ 16
φάγομαι ἄρτον, οὐδὲ πίομαι ὕδωρ ἐν τῷ τόπῳ τούτῳ. Ὅτι οὕ- 17
τως ἐντέταλταί μοι ἐν λόγῳ Κύριος, λέγων· οὐ μὴ φάγῃς ἐκεῖ ἄρτον,
καὶ μὴ πίῃς ὕδωρ, καὶ μὴ ἐπιστρέψῃς ἐκεῖ ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ ᾗ ἐπορεύθης
ἐν αὐτῇ. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτόν· κἀγὼ προφήτης εἰμὶ καθὼς σύ, 18
καὶ ἄγγελος λελάληκέ μοι ἐν ῥήματι Κυρίου, λέγων· ἐπίστρεψαι
αὐτὸν πρὸς σεαυτὸν εἰς τὸν οἶκόν σου, καὶ φάγεται ἄρτον, καὶ πίεται ὕδωρ· καὶ ἐψεύσατο αὐτῷ. Καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν αὐτὸν σὺν ἑαυτῷ, 19
καὶ ἔφαγεν ἄρτον ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔπιεν ὕδωρ. Καὶ ἐγένε- 20
το αὐτῶν καθημένων ἐπὶ τῆς τραπέζης, καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου
πρὸς τὸν προφήτην τὸν ἐπιστρέψαντα αὐτόν· Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς τὸν ἄν- 21
θρωπον τοῦ Θεοῦ τὸν ἥκοντα ἐξ Ἰούδα, λέγων· τάδε λέγει Κύριος·

**6** [Then King Jeroboam spake unto] the man of God, and said, "Entreat now the favor of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored to me." And the man of God entreated the favor of the LORD, and He restored the king's hand unto him; and it became as it was aforetime.
**7** And the king spake unto the man of God, saying, "Come home with me, and refresh thyself with bread, and I will give thee a reward."
**8** And the man of God said unto the king, "Though thou wouldest give me half of thine house, yet will I not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place;
**9** for so was it commanded me by the word of the LORD, saying, 'Thou shalt eat no bread, nor drink water, neither shalt thou return by the way that thou camest.'"
**10** So he departed by another way, and returned not by the way wherein he came unto Bethel.
**11** Now there dwelt in Bethel an old prophet; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel, [even] the words which he had spoken unto the king; and they turned the face of their father.
**12** And their father spake unto them, saying, "By what way went he?" And his sons showed him the way which the man of God, that came from Judah, had gone.
**13** And he said unto his sons, "Saddle me the ass." So they saddled him the ass, and he rode thereon.
**14** And he went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak; and he said unto him, "Art thou the man of God that camest from Judah?" And he answered him, "I am."
**15** And he said unto him, "Come home with me, and eat bread."
**16** And he said, "I may not return with thee, nor eat bread, nor drink water in this place;
**17** for a word from the LORD hath been given me, saying, 'Thou shalt not eat bread there, nor drink water, neither shalt thou return there by the way which thou camest.'"
**18** And he said unto him, "I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel hath spoken unto me by the word of the LORD, saying, 'Bring him back with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water.'" And he lied unto him.
**19** So he turned back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water.
**20** And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the LORD came unto the prophet that had brought him back;
**21** and he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, "Thus saith the LORD: "
