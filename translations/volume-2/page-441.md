πράξας. Οὐ μὴν δὲ ἀλλ᾽ εἴησαν οἱ ἐχθροί μου ὥσπερ ἡ καταστροφὴ
τῶν ἀσεβῶν, καὶ οἱ ἐπανιστάμενοί μοι ὥσπερ ἡ ἀπώλεια τῶν
παρανόμων. Ναὶ μὴν τίς γάρ ἐστιν (ἔτι) ἐλπὶς ἀσεβεῖ ὅτι ἐπέχει;
(μὴ) πεποιθὼς ἐπὶ Κύριον εἰ ἄρα σωθήσεται; Ἢ τὴν δέησιν αὐ-
τοῦ ἀκούσηι ὁ Κύριος; ἐπελθούσης δὲ αὐτῶι ἀνάγκης, μὴ ἔχει τινὰ
παῤῥησίαν ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ; ἢ ὡς ἐπικαλεσαμένου αὐτὸν, εἰσακούσε-
ται αὐτοῦ; Ἀλλὰ δὴ ἀναγγελῶ ὑμῖν τί ἐστιν ἐν χειρὶ Κυρίου, ἅ
ἐστι παρὰ τῶι παντοκράτορι, οὐ ψεύσομαι. Ἰδοὺ (δὴ) πάντες ὑμεῖς
ἑωράκατε· διατὶ δὲ κενὰ κενοῖς ἐπιβάλλεσθε; Αὕτη ἡ μερὶς ἀνθρώ-
που ἀσεβοῦς παρὰ Κυρίου· κτῆμα δὲ δυναστῶν ἐξελεύσεται παρὰ
παντοκράτορος ἐπ᾽ αὐτούς. Ἐὰν πολλοὶ γένωνται οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ, εἰς
σφαγὴν ἔσονται, ἐὰν δὲ καὶ ἀνδρωθῶσι, προσαἰτήσωσιν· οἱ δὲ περι-
όντες αὐτοῦ (κακῶι) θανάτωι τελευτήσουσι, καὶ χήρας αὐτῶν οὐδεὶς
ἐλεήσει. Ἐὰν συναγάγηι ὥσπερ γῆν ἀργύριον, ἴσα δὲ πηλῶι χρυ-
σίον ἑτοιμάσηι, ταῦτα πάντα δίκαιοι περιποιήσονται, τὰ δὲ χρή-
ματα αὐτοῦ ἀληθινοὶ καθεξοῦσιν· ἀπέβη δὲ ὁ οἶκος αὐτοῦ ὥσπερ
σητὸς, καὶ ὥσπερ ἀράχνηι ἃ συνετήρησε. Πλούσιος κοιμηθήσεται
καὶ οὐ προσθήσει, ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ διήνοιξε, καὶ οὐχ ἔστι. (Κοι-
μηθέντι) συναντήσονται αὐτῶι ὥσπερ ὕδωρ ἐδῦναι, νυκτὶ δὲ ὑφ-
είλατο αὐτὸν γνόφος· ἀναλήψεται αὐτὸν καύσων, καὶ ἀπελεύσεται,
καὶ λικμήσει αὐτὸν ἐκ τοῦ τόπου αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀποῤῥίψει ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸν,
καὶ οὐ φείσεται· ἐκ χειρὸς αὐτοῦ φυγὴ φεύξεται· κροτήσει ἐπ᾽ αὐ-
τὸν χεῖρας αὐτοῦ, καὶ συριεῖ αὐτὸν ἐκ τοῦ τόπου αὐτοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΗ΄. XXVIII.
ἜΣΤΙ γὰρ ἀργυρίωι τόπος ὅθεν γίνεται, τόπος δὲ χρυσίωι
ὅθεν διηθεῖται· σίδηρος μὲν γὰρ ἐκ γῆς γίνεται, χαλκὸς δὲ ἴσα λί-
θωι λατομεῖται. Τάξιν ἔθετο σκότει, καὶ (καιρῶν) πᾶν πέρας αὐ-
τὸ ἐξακριβάζεται. Λίθος σκοτία καὶ σκιὰ θανάτου· διακοπὴ χει-
μάρρου ἀπὸ κονίας. Οἱ δὲ ἐπιλανθανόμενοι ὁδὸν δικαιοσύνης ἠσθέ-
νησαν· ἐκ βροτῶν ἐσαλεύθησαν. Γῆ, ἐξ αὐτῆς ἐξελεύσεται ἄρτος,
ὑποκάτω αὐτῆς ἐστράφη ὡς πῦρ. Τόπος σαπφείρου (καὶ) οἱ λίθοι
αὐτῆς, καὶ χῶμα χρυσίον αὐτῶι. Τρίβος, οὐκ ἔγνω αὐτὴν πετει-
νῶν, καὶ οὐ παρέβλεψεν αὐτὴν ὀφθαλμὸς γυπός· οὐκ ἐπάτησαν αὐ-
τὴν υἱοὶ ἀλαζόνων, οὐ παρῆλθεν ἐπ᾽ αὐτῆς λέων. Ἐν ἀκροτόμωι

## CHAPTER XXVII.

**7** For I am not conscious to myself of having done anything amiss. But let my foes be as the destruction of the ungodly, and those who rise up against me as the ruin of the lawless.
**8** For what [is] the hope of the ungodly, when he trusts that he shall endure? Will he, perchance, be saved, though he trusts not in the Lord?
**9** Or shall the Lord hear his petition? And when affliction comes upon him, has he any boldness before Him? Or, as one who has called upon Him, shall He hear him?
**10** But indeed, I will declare unto you what is in the hand of the Lord, and what things are with the Almighty; I will not lie.
**11** Behold, [now] all of you have seen; but why do you lay vain things upon vain [answers]?
**12** This is the portion of the ungodly man from the Lord, and the possession of the mighty shall come forth upon them from the Almighty.
**13** If his children be many, they shall be for slaughter; and if they grow to manhood, they shall beg for bread.
**14** And his survivors shall die by an evil death, and no man shall pity their widows.
**15** If he gather silver as the dust, and prepare gold as the mire,
**16** All these things the righteous shall acquire, and his possessions the upright shall possess.
**17** But his house has vanished as the moth, and as a spider's web are the things which he guarded.
**18** The rich man shall lie down, and shall not add [to his wealth]; he opens his eyes, and he is no more.
**19** [When he has fallen asleep], they shall meet him, [and he shall be] as waters that sink; and in the night a thick darkness has stolen him away.
**20** A scorching heat shall seize him, and he shall depart; and it shall winnow him from his place, and shall cast [itself] upon him, and shall not spare [him].
**21** Flight itself shall flee from his hand; [it] shall clap its hands over him, and shall hiss him out of his place.

## CHAPTER XXVIII.

**1** For there is a place for silver whence it comes, and a place for gold whence it is refined.
**2** For iron is taken from the earth, and bronze is mined like unto stone.
**3** He has set order in darkness, and every limit [of all things], it does discern precisely. A stone [is] darkness, and the shadow of death; a severance of the winter-torrent from the dust.
**4** But those who forget the way of righteousness have become weakened; they have been shaken from among mortals.
**5** The earth, from it comes forth bread; beneath it, it is turned as fire.
**6** A place of sapphire and its stones, and a mound of gold for it.
**7** A path, the birds have not known it, and the eye of the vulture has not seen it.
**8** The sons of arrogant men have not trodden upon it, nor has the lion passed over it.
**9** In the sheer cliff,
