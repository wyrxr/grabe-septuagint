ΚΕΦ. ΚΔ΄. XXIV.

1 ΚΑΙ προσέθετο ὀργὴ Κυρίου ἐκκαῆναι ἐν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐπέσεισε τὸν Δαυὶδ ἐν αὐτοῖς, λέγων· βάδιζε, ἀρίθμησον τὸν Ἰσραὴλ
2 καὶ τὸν Ἰούδαν. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς πρὸς Ἰωὰβ ἄρχοντα τῆς ἰσχύος τὸν μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ· διελθε δὴ πάσας φυλὰς τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, ἀπὸ Δὰν καὶ ἕως Βηρσαβεέ, καὶ ἐπίσκεψαι τὸν λαόν, καὶ γνώσομαι τὸν
3 ἀριθμὸν τοῦ λαοῦ. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰωὰβ πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα· καὶ προσθείη Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου πρὸς τὸν λαὸν ὥσπερ αὐτούς, καὶ ὥσπερ αὐτοὺς ἑκατονταπλασίων, καὶ οἱ ὀφθαλμοί τοῦ κυρίου μου τοῦ βασιλέως ὁρῶντες. Καὶ ὁ κύριός μου ὁ βασιλεὺς ἱνατί βούλεται ἐν
4 τῷ λόγῳ τούτῳ; Καὶ ὑπερίσχυσεν ὁ λόγος τοῦ βασιλέως πρὸς Ἰωάβ, καὶ εἰς τοὺς ἄρχοντας τῆς δυνάμεως. Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Ἰωὰβ καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες τῆς ἰσχύος ἐνώπιον τοῦ βασιλέως ἐπισκέψασθαι τὸν
5 λαὸν τὸν Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ διέβησαν τὸν Ἰορδάνην, καὶ παρενέβαλον ἐν Ἀροὴρ ἐκ δεξιῶν τῆς πόλεως τῆς ἐν μέσῳ τῆς φάραγγος Γὰδ
6 καὶ Ἑλιάζηρ. Καὶ ἦλθον εἰς Γαλαάδ, καὶ εἰς γῆν Ἐθδὼν Ἀδασαί, καὶ παρεγένοντο εἰς Δὰν Ἰάσαν (καὶ Ἰούδαν) καὶ ἐκύκλωσαν εἰς Σιδῶνα (τὴν μεγάλην).
7 Καὶ ἦλθον εἰς Μάφαρ Τύρου καὶ πάσας τὰς πόλεις τοῦ Εὐαίου καὶ τοῦ Χανανίου. Καὶ ἦλθαν κατὰ νότον Ἰούδα εἰς Βηρσαβεέ,
8 καὶ περιώδευσαν ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ· καὶ παρεγένοντο ἀπὸ τέλους ἐννέα μηνῶν καὶ εἴκοσι ἡμερῶν
9 εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ ἔδωκεν Ἰωὰβ τὸν ἀριθμὸν τῆς ἐπισκέψεως τοῦ λαοῦ πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα. Καὶ ἐγένετο Ἰσραήλ, ὀκτακόσιαι χιλιάδες ἀνδρῶν δυνάμεως σπωμένων ῥομφαίαν. Καὶ ἀνὴρ Ἰού-
10 δα, πεντακόσιαι χιλιάδες ἀνδρῶν μαχητῶν. Καὶ ἐπάταξε καρδία Δαυὶδ αὐτὸν μετὰ τὸ ἀριθμῆσαι τὸν λαόν. Καὶ εἶπε Δαυὶδ πρὸς Κύριον· ἥμαρτον σφόδρα, ὅτι ἐποίησα τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο· Νῦν, Κύριε, παραβίβασον δὴ τὴν ἀνομίαν τοῦ δούλου σου, ὅτι ἐμωράνθην
11 σφόδρα. Καὶ ἀνέστη Δαυὶδ τοπρωΐ. Καὶ λόγος Κυρίου ἐγένετο
12 πρὸς Γὰδ τὸν προφήτην, τὸν ὁρῶντα τοῦ Δαυίδ, λέγων· πορευθῆτι καὶ λάλησον πρὸς Δαυίδ, λέγων τάδε λέγει Κύριος· τρία ἐγώ εἰμι αἵρω ἐπὶ σέ, καὶ ἐκλέξαι σεαυτῷ ἐν ἐξ αὐτῶν, καὶ ποιήσω σοι.
13 Καὶ εἰσῆλθε Γὰδ πρὸς Δαυίδ, καὶ ἀνήγγειλεν αὐτῷ, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· εἰ ἔλθῃ σοι τρία ἔτη λιμὸς ἐν τῇ γῇ σου, ἢ τρεῖς

**CHAPTER 24**

1 And again the wrath of the Lord was kindled in Israel, and He incited David among them, saying, "Go, number Israel
2 and Judah." And the king said unto Joab, the captain of the host, who was with him, "Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, and number the people, that I may know the number of the people."
3 And Joab said unto the king, "May the Lord thy God add unto the people, even as they are, and a hundredfold more than they are, and may the eyes of my lord the king behold [it]. But why doth my lord the king desire this thing?"
4 But the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. So Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king to number
5 the people of Israel. And they crossed over the Jordan, and pitched their tents in Aroer, on the right side of the city which is in the midst of the valley of Gad,
6 and by Eliazēr. And they came to Gilead, and to the land of Ethdon Adasai, and they came to Dan Jasan (and Judah), and they compassed about unto Sidon (the great).
7 And they came to Maphar of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivite and of the Canaanite. And they came southward into Judah, to Beersheba,
8 and they traversed all the land. And from the end of nine months and twenty days they came
9 unto Jerusalem. And Joab delivered the sum of the numbering of the people unto the king. And there were of Israel, eight hundred thousand mighty men that drew the sword; and of the men of
10 Judah, five hundred thousand men of war. And David's heart smote him after he had numbered the people. And David said unto the Lord, "I have sinned grievously, for I have done this thing. Now, O Lord, I pray Thee, take away the iniquity of Thy servant, for I have played the fool
11 exceedingly." And when David was risen in the morning, the word of the Lord came
12 unto Gad the prophet, David's seer, saying, "Go and speak unto David, saying, 'Thus saith the Lord: Three [judgments] I do lay upon thee; choose thee one of them, and I will do it unto thee.'"
13 So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, "Shall there come unto thee three years of famine in thy land? Or three..."
