ΚΕΦ. Ε´.
εἶπον αὐτοῖς· ἀπαιτήσει ἀνὴρ τὸν ἀδελφὸν ἑαυτοῦ ὑμεῖς ἀπαιτεῖτε ;
καὶ ἔδωκα ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς ἐκκλησίαν μεγάλην, καὶ εἶπον αὐτοῖς· ἡμεῖς 8
κεκτήμεθα τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς ἡμῶν τοὺς Ἰουδαίους τοὺς πωλουμένους
τοῖς ἔθνεσιν ἐν ἑκουσίῳ ἡμῶν· καὶ ὑμεῖς πωλεῖτε τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς
ὑμῶν καὶ παραδοθήσονται ἡμῖν; καὶ ἡσύχασαν, καὶ οὐχ οὕτως
ἐν φόβῳ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν ἀπελεύσεσθε ἀπὸ ὀνειδισμοῦ τῶν ἐθνῶν
τῶν ἐχθρῶν ἡμῶν. Καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοί μου, καὶ οἱ γνωστοί μου, καὶ 10
ἐγώ, ἐθήκαμεν ἑαυτοῖς ἀργύριον καὶ σῖτον· ἐγκατελίπομεν δὴ τὴν
ἀπαίτησιν ταύτην. Ἐπιστρέψατε δὴ αὐτοῖς ὡς σήμερον ἀγροὺς 11
αὐτῶν καὶ ἀμπελῶνας αὐτῶν, ἐλαιῶνας αὐτῶν καὶ οἰκίας αὐτῶν,
καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀργυρίου τὸν σῖτον καὶ τὸν οἶνον καὶ τὸ ἔλαιον ἐξενέγκατε ἑαυτοῖς.
Καὶ εἶπαν· ἀποδώσομεν, καὶ παρ᾽ αὐτῶν οὐ 12
ζητήσομεν, οὕτως ποιήσομεν καθὼς σὺ λέγεις. καὶ ἐκάλεσα τοὺς
ἱερεῖς, καὶ ὥρκισα αὐτοὺς ποιῆσαι ὡς τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο. Καὶ τὴν 13
ἀναβολήν μου ἐξετίναξα, καὶ εἶπον· οὕτως ἐκτινάξαι ὁ Θεὸς πάν-
τα ἄνδρα ὃς οὐ στήσει τὸν λόγον τοῦτον, ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ καὶ
ἐκ κόπου αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔσται οὕτως ἐκτετιναγμένος καὶ κενός. καὶ
εἶπε πᾶσα ἡ ἐκκλησία, ἀμήν· καὶ ἤνεσαν τὸν Κύριον. καὶ ἐποίη-
σεν ὁ λαὸς τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο. Ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέρας ἧς ἐνετείλατό μοι 14
εἶναι εἰς ἄρχοντα αὐτῶν ἐν γῇ Ἰούδα, ἀπὸ ἔτους εἰκοστοῦ καὶ ἕως
ἔτους τριακοστοῦ καὶ δευτέρου τῷ Ἀρθασασθά, ἔτη δώδεκα, ἐγὼ
καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοί μου βίαν αὐτῶν οὐκ ἔφαγον. Καὶ τὰς βίας τὰς 15
πρώτας ἃς πρὸ ἐμοῦ ἐβάρυναν ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς, καὶ ἐλάβοσαν παρ᾽ αὐ-
τῶν ἐν ἄρτοις καὶ ἐν οἴνῳ ἔσχατον ἀργύριον, δίδραχμα τεσσαρά-
κοντα· καὶ οἱ ἐκτετιναγμένοι αὐτῶν ἐξουσιάζονται ἐπὶ τὸν λαόν.
κἀγὼ οὐκ ἐποίησα οὕτως ἀπὸ προσώπου φόβου Θεοῦ. Καὶ ἐν ἔρ- 16
γῳ τοῦ τείχους τούτων οὐκ ἐκράτησα, ἀγρὸν οὐκ ἐκτησάμην· καὶ
πάντες οἱ συνηγμένοι ἐκεῖ ἐπὶ τὸ ἔργον. Καὶ οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι ἑκατὸν 17
καὶ πεντήκοντα ἄνδρες, καὶ ἐρχόμενοι πρὸς ἡμᾶς ἀπὸ τῶν ἐθνῶν
τῶν κύκλῳ ἡμῶν ἐπὶ τραπέζαν μου. Καὶ ἦν γιγνόμενον εἰς ἡμέ- 18
ραν μίαν μόσχος εἷς, καὶ πρόβατα ἓξ ἐκλεκτὰ καὶ χίμαρος ἐγί-
γνοντό μοι. καὶ ἀναμέσον τῶν δέκα ἡμερῶν ἐν πᾶσιν οἶνος τῷ πλή-
θει. καὶ σὺν τούτοις ἄρτους τῆς βίας οὐκ ἐζήτησα, ὅτι βαρεῖα ἡ
δουλεία ἐπὶ τὸν λαὸν τοῦτον. Μνήσθητί μου ὁ Θεὸς εἰς ἀγαθὸν 19
πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησα τῷ λαῷ τούτῳ.

#### CHAPTER V.

<sup>7</sup> ...and I said unto them, "Doth a man exact [usury] from his own brother? Ye yourselves do exact [it]?"
<sup>8</sup> And I gathered a great assembly against them, and I spake unto them, saying, "We have redeemed our brethren, the Jews, who were sold unto the nations by our own ransom. And do ye [now] sell your brethren, and shall they be delivered unto us [to be bought again]?" And they held their peace, and found no word [to answer].
<sup>9</sup> And I said, "Not good is this thing that ye do. Ought ye not so to walk in the fear of our God, because of the reproach of the nations, our enemies?
<sup>10</sup> Moreover, my brethren, and my kinsfolk, and I, we have lent [to others] money and corn. Let us forego, I pray you, this exaction.
<sup>11</sup> Restore unto them, I pray you, even this very day, their fields, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses; and from the silver, the grain, the wine, and the oil [which ye have taken], do ye offer forth for yourselves."
<sup>12</sup> And they said, "We will restore [it], and we will not require [it] from them; so will we do as thou sayest." And I called the priests, and made them swear to do according to this word.
<sup>13</sup> And I shook out my garment, and I said, "So may God shake out every man who shall not keep this word, from his house and from his labor, and so shall he be shaken out and empty." And all the assembly said, "Amen," and praised the Lord. And the people did according to this word.
<sup>14</sup> From the day that I was commanded to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes, [which is] twelve years, neither I nor my brethren did partake of their forced levy.
<sup>15</sup> And the former governors that were before me had burdened them, and had taken from them, in bread and in wine, even a last sum of silver, forty didrachmas; and their appointed agents did exercise dominion over the people. But I did not so, because of the fear of God.
<sup>16</sup> And in the work of these walls I seized nothing, neither acquired I any field; and all those gathered there [did likewise] unto the work.
<sup>17</sup> Moreover, the Jews, one hundred and fifty men, and those who came unto us from among the nations that were around us, [were] at my table.
<sup>18</sup> And there was made ready for me, each day, one ox, and six choice sheep; and a kid they were made for me. And within the space of ten days, wine was in abundance for all [my guests]. And withal, the bread of the governor's levy I sought not, for heavy was the servitude upon this people.
<sup>19</sup> Remember me, O my God, for good, all that I have done for this people.
