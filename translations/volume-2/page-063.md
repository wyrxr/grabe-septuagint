**ΚΕΦ. ΚΗ΄. ΚΘ΄. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Α΄.**
**19** Κύριος τὸν Ἰσραὴλ μετὰ σοῦ εἰς χεῖρας ἀλλοφύλων, καὶ αὔριον σὺ καὶ οἱ υἱοί σου μετὰ σοῦ πεσοῦνται, καὶ τὴν παρεμβολὴν Ἰσραὴλ δώσει Κύριος εἰς χεῖρας ἀλλοφύλων.
**20** Καὶ ἔσπευσε Σαούλ, καὶ ἔπεσεν ἑστηκὼς ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, καὶ ἐφοβήθη σφόδρα ἀπὸ τῶν λόγων Σαμουήλ, καὶ ἰσχὺς οὐκ ἦν ἐν αὐτῷ ἔτι, οὐ γὰρ ἔφαγεν ἄρτον ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν ἐκείνην καὶ ὅλην τὴν νύκτα.
**21** Καὶ εἰσῆλθεν ἡ γυνὴ πρὸς Σαούλ, καὶ ἴδεν ὅτι ἔσπευδε σφόδρα, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτόν· Ἰδοὺ δὴ ἤκουσεν ἡ δούλη σου τῆς φωνῆς σου, καὶ ἐθέμην τὴν ψυχήν μου ἐν τῇ χειρί μου, καὶ ἤκουσα τοὺς λόγους οὓς ἐλάλησάς μοι· καὶ νῦν ἄκουσον δὴ τῆς φωνῆς τῆς δούλης σου, καὶ
**22** παραθήσω ἐνώπιόν σου ψωμὸν ἄρτου, καὶ φάγε, καὶ ἔσται ἐν σοὶ ἰσχύς, ὅτι πορεύῃ ἐν ὁδῷ.
**23** Καὶ οὐκ ἐβουλήθη φαγεῖν· καὶ παρεβιάζοντο αὐτὸν οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ καὶ ἡ γυνή, καὶ ἤκουσε τῆς φωνῆς αὐτῶν, καὶ ἀνέστη ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἐκάθισεν ἐπὶ τὸν δίφρον.
**24** Καὶ τῇ γυναικὶ ἦν δάμαλις νομὰς ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ· καὶ ἔσπευσε καὶ ἔθυσεν αὐτήν· καὶ ἔλαβεν ἄλευρα καὶ ἐφύρασε, καὶ ἔπεψεν ἄζυμα,
**25** καὶ προσήγαγεν ἐνώπιον Σαούλ, καὶ ἐνώπιον τῶν παίδων αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἔφαγον, καὶ ἀνέστησαν, καὶ ἀπῆλθον τὴν νύκτα ἐκείνην.

**ΚΕΦ. ΚΘ΄. ΧΧΙΧ.**

**1** ΚΑΙ συναθροίζονται ἀλλόφυλοι πάσας τὰς παρεμβολὰς αὑτῶν εἰς Ἀφέκ, καὶ Ἰσραὴλ παρενέβαλεν ἐν Ἀενδὼρ τὴν ἐν Ἰζραέλ.
**2** Καὶ σατράπαι τῶν ἀλλοφύλων παρεπορεύοντο εἰς ἑκατοντάδας καὶ χιλιάδας, καὶ Δαυὶδ καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες αὐτοῦ παρεπορεύοντο ἐπ᾽ ἐσχάτῳ μετὰ Ἀγχοῦς.
**3** Καὶ εἶπον οἱ σατράπαι τῶν ἀλλοφύλων· τίνες οἱ διαπορευόμενοι οὗτοι; καὶ εἶπεν Ἀγχοῦς πρὸς τοὺς στρατηγοὺς τῶν ἀλλοφύλων· οὐχ οὗτος Δαυὶδ ὁ δοῦλος Σαούλ βασιλέως Ἰσραήλ, ὃς γέγονε μεθ᾽ ἡμῶν ἡμέρας τοῦτο δεύτερον ἔτος; καὶ οὐχ εὕρηκα ἐν αὐτῷ οὐδὲν ἀφ᾽ ἧς ἡμέρας ἐνέπεσε πρὸς με καὶ ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης.
**4** Καὶ ἐλυπήθησαν ἐπ᾽ αὐτῷ οἱ στρατηγοὶ τῶν ἀλλοφύλων, καὶ λέγουσιν αὐτῷ· ἀπόστρεφον τὸν ἄνδρα καὶ ἀποστραφήτω εἰς τὸν τόπον αὑτοῦ, οὗ κατέστησας αὐτὸν ἐκεῖ, καὶ μὴ ἐρχέσθω μεθ᾽ ἡμῶν εἰς τὸν πόλεμον, καὶ μὴ γινέσθω ἐπίβουλος τῆς παρεμβολῆς. Καὶ ἐν τίνι διαλλαγήσεται οὗτος τῷ κυρίῳ αὐτοῦ; οὐχὶ ἐν ταῖς κεφαλαῖς τῶν ἀνδρῶν ἐκείνων;
**5** Οὐχ οὗτος Δαυίδ, ᾧ ἐξῆρχον ἐν χοροῖς, λέγοντες· ἐπάταξε Σαούλ ἐν χιλιάσιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ Δαυὶδ ἐν μυριάσι;
**6** Καὶ ἐκάλεσεν Ἀγχοῦς τὸν Δαυίδ, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· Ζῇ Κύριος, ὅτι εὐθὺς σὺ καὶ ἀγαθὸς ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς μου, καὶ ἡ ἔξοδός σου καὶ ἡ εἴσοδός σου μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ, καὶ ὅτι οὐχ εὕρηκα ἐν σοὶ κακίαν ἀφ᾿ ἧς ἡμέρας ἥκεις πρὸς με ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας τῆς σήμερον, καὶ ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς τῶν σατραπῶν οὐκ ἀγαθὸς σύ.
**7** Καὶ νῦν ἀνάστρεφε καὶ πορεύου εἰς εἰρήνην, καὶ οὐ μὴ ποιήσεις κακίαν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς τῶν σατραπῶν τῶν ἀλλοφύλων.
**8** Καὶ εἶπε Δαυὶδ πρὸς Ἀγχοῦς· τί πεποίηκά σοι καὶ τί εὗρες ἐν τῷ δούλῳ σου ἀφ᾿ ἧς ἡμέρας ἤμην ἐνώπιόν σου καὶ ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης, ὅτι οὐ μὴ ἔλθω πολεμῆσαι τοὺς ἐχθροὺς τοῦ κυρίου μου τοῦ βασιλέως;
**9** Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Ἀγχοῦς καὶ εἶπε πρὸς Δαυίδ· οἶδα ὅτι ἀγαθὸς σὺ ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς μου καθὼς ἄγγελος Θεοῦ, ἀλλ᾿ οἱ σατράπαι τῶν ἀλλοφύλων λέγουσιν, οὐχ ἥξει μεθ᾿ ἡμῶν εἰς πόλεμον.
**10** Καὶ νῦν ὄρθρισον τοπρωΐ, καὶ οἱ παῖδες τοῦ κυρίου σου οἱ ἤκοντες μετὰ σοῦ, καὶ πορεύεσθε εἰς τὸν τόπον οὗ κατέστησα ὑμᾶς, καὶ λόγον λοιμὸν μὴ θῇς ἐν καρδίᾳ σου, ὅτι ἀγαθὸς σὺ ἐνώπιον ἐμοῦ, καὶ διορθίσατε ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ, καὶ φωτισάτω ὑμῖν, καὶ πορεύθητε.
**11** Καὶ ὤρθρισε Δαυὶδ αὐτὸς καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες αὐτοῦ ἀπελθεῖν τοπρωΐ καὶ φυλάσσειν τὴν γῆν τῶν ἀλλοφύλων, καὶ οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι ἀνέβησαν πολεμεῖν ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ.

**ΚΕΦ Λ΄. XXX.**

**1** ΚΑΙ ἐγενήθη εἰσελθόντος Δαυὶδ καὶ τῶν ἀνδρῶν αὐτοῦ εἰς Σικελὰγ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τρίτῃ, καὶ Ἀμαλὴκ ἀπέθετο ἐπὶ τὸν νότον καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν Σικελὰγ, καὶ ἐπάταξε τὴν Σικελὰγ, καὶ ἐνέπρησεν αὐτὴν ἐν πυρί.
**2** Καὶ ᾐχμαλώτευσε καὶ τὰς γυναῖκας καὶ πάντα τὰ ἐν αὐτῇ ἀπὸ μικροῦ καὶ ἕως μεγάλου· οὐκ ἐθανάτωσεν ἄνδρα καὶ γυναῖκα, ἀλλ᾿ ᾐχμαλώτευσαν, καὶ ἀπῆλθον εἰς τὴν ὁδὸν αὐτῶν.
**3** Καὶ ἦλθε Δαυὶδ καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες αὐτοῦ εἰς τὴν πόλιν, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐμπεπύρισται ἐν πυρί, αἱ δὲ γυναῖκες αὐτῶν καὶ αἱ θυγατέρες αὐτῶν αἰχμαλωτευόμενοι.
**4** Καὶ ἦρε Δαυὶδ καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες αὐτοῦ τὴν φωνὴν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔκλαυσαν ἕως ὅτου οὐκ ἦν ἐν αὐτοῖς ἰσχὺς ἔτι τοῦ κλαίειν.
**5** Καὶ ἀμφότεραι αἱ γυναῖκες Δαυὶδ ᾐχμαλωτεύθησαν, Ἀχινάαμ ἡ Ἰεζραηλίτις, καὶ Ἀβιγαία ἡ γυνὴ Νάβαλ τοῦ [Καρμηλίου].

2. A free and highly literary translation:

**20** Then Saul made haste and fell his full length upon the earth, and was sore afraid because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all that day, nor all that night.

**21** And when the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, she said unto him, "Behold, thy handmaid hath hearkened unto thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto the words which thou spakest unto me. Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid, and

**22** let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength in thee, for thou art to journey on thy way."

**23** But he refused, and said, "I will not eat." But his servants, and the woman, constrained him; and he hearkened unto their voice, and arose from the earth, and sat upon the couch.

**24** And the woman had a fatted calf in the house; and she made haste and slew it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof.

**25** And she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.

**CHAPTER XXIX.**

**1** NOW the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and Israel encamped in En-dor, which is in Jezreel.

**2** And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands; and David and his men passed on in the rear with Achish.

**3** Then said the princes of the Philistines, "Who are these passing through?" And Achish answered unto the princes of the Philistines, "Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who hath been with us now for these two years? And I have found no fault in him since the day he defected unto me, even unto this day."

**4** And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and they said unto him, "Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place where thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us. For wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master? Shall it not be with the heads of these men?"

**5** "Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, 'Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands'?"

**6** Then Achish called David, and said unto him, "As the LORD liveth, thou art upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the camp is good in my sight; for I have found no evil in thee since the day thou camest unto me, even unto this day. Nevertheless, the princes favour thee not.

**7** Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the princes of the Philistines."

**8** Then David said unto Achish, "What have I done? And what hast thou found in thy servant, so long as I have been before thee unto this day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?"

**9** And Achish answered and said unto David, "I know that thou art good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding, the princes of the Philistines have said, 'He shall not go up with us to the battle.'

**10** Now therefore, rise up early in the morning, thou, and the servants of thy lord that are come with thee; and go unto the place where I have appointed you. And set not an evil matter in thine heart, for thou art good in my sight. And set yourselves aright on the way, and may light be unto you; then go."

**11** So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning, and to return to guard the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to fight against Israel.

**CHAPTER XXX.**

**1** AND it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire.

**2** And had taken the women captive, and all that were therein, from the least even unto the greatest; they slew no man nor woman, but carried them away, and went on their way.

**3** So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives and their daughters were taken captive.

**4** Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.

**5** And David's two wives were taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
