υἱὸς Σαρουΐα ἐπὶ τῆς στρατιᾶς. Καὶ Ἰωσαφὰτ υἱὸς Ἀχιλουδ ἐπὶ
τῶν ὑπομνημάτων. Καὶ Σαδὼκ υἱὸς Ἀχιτὼβ καὶ Ἀχιμέλεχ υἱὸς
Ἀβιάθαρ, ἱερεῖς. Καὶ Σραΐας ὁ γραμματεύς. Καὶ Βαναγαΐας υἱὸς
Ἰωδαὲ σύμβουλος. Καὶ ὁ Χερεθθεί, καὶ ὁ Φελεθθεί, καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Δαυὶδ
αὐλάρχαι ἦσαν.

**ΚΕΦ. Θʹ. IX.**

**1** ΚΑΙ εἶπε Δαυίδ· εἰ ἔστιν ἔτι ὑπολελειμμένος τῷ οἴκῳ Σαοὺλ,
καὶ ποιήσω μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἔλεος ἕνεκεν Ἰωνάθαν;
**2** Καὶ ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου Σαοὺλ ἦν παῖς, καὶ ὄνομα αὐτῷ Σιβά. καὶ καλοῦσιν
αὐτὸν πρὸς Δαυίδ· Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτὸν ὁ βασιλεύς· εἰ σὺ εἶ Σιβά;
καὶ εἶπεν· ἐγὼ δοῦλος σός.
**3** Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεύς· εἰ ὑπολέλειπται τῷ οἴκῳ Σαοὺλ ἔτι
ἀνήρ, καὶ ποιήσω μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἔλεος Θεοῦ; καὶ εἶπε Σιβὰ πρὸς τὸν
βασιλέα· ἔτι ἐστὶν υἱὸς τῷ Ἰωνάθαν πεπληγὼς τοὺς πόδας.
**4** Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεύς· ποῦ οὗτος; καὶ εἶπε Σιβὰ πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα·
ἰδοὺ ἐν οἴκῳ Μαχεὶρ υἱοῦ Ἀμιὴλ, ἐκ τῆς Λοδάβαρ.
**5** Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ὁ βασιλεὺς, καὶ ἔλαβεν αὐτὸν ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου Μαχεὶρ,
υἱοῦ Ἀμιὴλ, ἐκ τῆς Λοδάβαρ.
**6** Καὶ παραγίνεται Μεμφιβοσθαὶ, υἱὸς Ἰωνάθαν υἱοῦ Σαοὺλ, πρὸς
τὸν βασιλέα Δαυίδ, καὶ ἔπεσεν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ, καὶ προσεκύνησεν
αὐτῷ· Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Δαυίδ· Μεμφιβοσθαί; καὶ εἶπεν· ἰδοὺ ὁ
δοῦλός σου.
**7** Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Δαυίδ· μὴ φοβοῦ, ὅτι ποιῶν ποιήσω ἔλεος μετὰ
σοῦ διὰ Ἰωνάθαν τὸν πατέρα σου, καὶ ἀποκαταστήσω σοι πάντα
ἀγρὸν Σαοὺλ τοῦ πατρός σου, καὶ σὺ φαγῇ ἄρτον ἐπὶ τῆς τραπέζης
μου διαπαντός.
**8** Καὶ προσεκύνησε Μεμφιβοσθαὶ, καὶ εἶπε· τίς εἰμι ὁ δοῦλός σου,
ὅτι ἐπέβλεψας ἐπὶ τὸν κύνα τὸν τεθνηκότα τὸν ὅμοιον ἐμοί;
**9** Καὶ ἐκάλεσεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Σιβὰ τὸ παιδάριον Σαοὺλ, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς
αὐτόν· πάντα ὅσα ἐστὶ τῷ Σαοὺλ καὶ ὅλῳ τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ, δέδωκα
τῷ υἱῷ τοῦ κυρίου σου.
**10** Καὶ ἐργᾷ αὐτῷ τὴν γῆν, σὺ, καὶ οἱ υἱοί σου, καὶ οἱ δοῦλοί σου,
καὶ εἰσοίσεις τῷ υἱῷ τοῦ Κυρίου σου ἄρτους, καὶ ἔδεται αὐτούς·
καὶ Μεμφιβοσθαὶ υἱὸς τοῦ κυρίου σου φάγεται ἄρτους διαπαντὸς
ἐπὶ τῆς τραπέζης μου. Καὶ τῷ Σιβᾷ ἦσαν πεντεκαίδεκα υἱοὶ καὶ
εἴκοσι δοῦλοι.
**11** Καὶ εἶπε Σιβὰ πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα· κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἐντέταλται
ὁ Κύριός μου ὁ βασιλεὺς τῷ δούλῳ αὑτοῦ, οὕτω ποιήσει ὁ δοῦλός σου.

### Chapter 9

**1** And David said, Is there yet any left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan’s sake?
**2** And of the house of Saul there was a servant, whose name was Siba; and they called him unto David. And the king said unto him, Art thou Siba? And he answered, I am thy servant.
**3** And the king said, Is there yet a man remaining of the house of Saul, that I may show him the mercy of God? And Siba said unto the king, There is yet a son of Jonathan, who is smitten in his feet.
**4** And the king said, Where is he? And Siba said unto the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of Amiel, in Lodabar.
**5** Then the king sent and fetched him out of the house of Machir, the son of Amiel, from Lodabar.
**6** And Memphibosthai, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came unto King David, and fell on his face, and prostrated himself before him. And David said unto him, Memphibosthai? And he answered, Behold, thy servant!
**7** And David said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely show thee kindness for Jonathan thy father’s sake, and will restore unto thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually.
**8** And Memphibosthai prostrated himself and said, What is thy servant, that thou shouldst regard [even] such a dead dog as I am?
**9** Then the king called Siba, Saul’s young servant, and said unto him, All that belonged to Saul and to all his house have I given unto thy master’s son.
**10** And thou shalt till the land for him, thou, and thy sons, and thy servants; and thou shalt bring in loaves for thy master’s son, and he shall eat them. And Memphibosthai, thy master’s son, shall eat bread continually at my table. Now Siba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.
**11** Then said Siba unto the king, According to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do.
