ὡς πίπτει ἡ δρόσος ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, καὶ οὐχ ὑπολειψόμεθα ἐν αὐ-
13 τῷ καὶ ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς ἀνδράσι τοῖς μετ’ αὐτοῦ καί γε ἕνα. Καὶ
ἐὰν εἰς τὴν πόλιν συναχθῇ, καὶ λήψεται πᾶς (ἀνὴρ) Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς
τὴν πόλιν ἐκείνην σχοινία, καὶ συροῦμεν αὐτὴν ἕως εἰς τὸν χει-
14 μάρρουν, ὅπως μὴ καταλειφθῇ ἐκεῖ μηδὲ λίθος. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἀβεσ-
σαλὼμ καὶ πᾶς ἀνὴρ Ἰσραὴλ ἀγαθὴ ἡ βουλὴ Χουσεὶ τοῦ Ἀρα-
χεὶ ὑπὲρ τὴν βουλὴν Ἀχιτόφελ. Καὶ Κύριος ἐνετείλατο διασκε-
δάσαι τὴν βουλὴν Ἀχιτόφελ τὴν ἀγαθήν, ὅπως ἂν ἐπαγάγῃ Κύ-
15 ριος ἐπὶ Ἀβεσαλὼμ τὰ κακὰ πάντα. Καὶ εἶπε Χουσεὶ πρὸς Σα-
δὼκ καὶ Ἀβιάθαρ, τοὺς ἱερεῖς· οὕτως καὶ οὕτως συνεβούλευσεν
Ἀχιτόφελ τῷ Ἀβεσαλὼμ καὶ τοῖς πρεσβυτέροις Ἰσραήλ· καὶ
16 οὕτως καὶ οὕτως συνεβούλευσα ἐγώ. Καὶ νῦν ἀποστείλατε ταχύ, καὶ
ἀπαγγείλατε τῷ Δαυΐδ, λέγοντες· μὴ αὐλισθῇς τὴν νύκτα ἐν Ἀ-
ραβὼθ τῆς ἐρήμου, καί γε διαβαίνων σπεῦσον, μήποτε καταπίῃ
17 τὸν βασιλέα, καὶ πάντα τὸν λαὸν τὸν μετ’ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ Ἰωνάθαν
καὶ Ἀχιμάας εἰστήκεισαν ἐν τῇ πηγῇ Ῥωγήλ, καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἡ
παιδίσκη, καὶ ἀνήγγειλεν αὐτοῖς. Καὶ αὐτοὶ πορεύονται, καὶ ἀν-
αγγέλλουσι τῷ βασιλεῖ Δαυΐδ, ὅτι οὐκ ἐδύναντο ὀφθῆναι τοῦ εἰ-
18 σελθεῖν εἰς τὴν πόλιν. Καὶ εἶδεν αὐτοὺς παιδάριον, καὶ ἀπήγ-
γειλε τῷ Ἀβεσαλώμ. Καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν οἱ δύο ταχέως, καὶ εἰ-
σῆλθον εἰς οἰκίαν ἀνδρὸς ἐν Βαουρείμ· καὶ αὐτῷ λάκκος ἐν τῇ
19 αὐλῇ, καὶ κατέβησαν ἐκεῖ. Καὶ ἔλαβεν ἡ γυνή, καὶ διεπέτα-
σε τὸ ἐπικάλυμμα ἐπὶ πρόσωπον τοῦ λάκκου, καὶ ἔψυξεν ἐπ’ αὐ-
τῷ Ἀραρώθ, καὶ οὐκ ἐγνώσθη ῥῆμα. Καὶ ἦλθαν οἱ παῖδες Ἀβες-
20 σαλὼμ πρὸς τὴν γυναῖκα εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν, καὶ εἶπαν· ποῦ Ἀχι-
μάας καὶ Ἰωνάθαν; καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς ἡ γυνή· παρῆλθον μικρὸν
τοῦ ὕδατος· καὶ ἐζήτησαν, καὶ οὐχ εὗρον, καὶ ἀνέστρεψαν εἰς
21 Ἱερουσαλήμ. Ἐγένετο δὲ μετὰ τὸ ἀπελθεῖν αὐτούς, καὶ ἀνέβη-
σαν ἐκ τοῦ λάκκου, καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν, καὶ ἀνήγγειλαν τῷ βασιλεῖ
Δαυΐδ, καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς Δαυΐδ· ἀνάστητε, καὶ διάβητε ταχέως τὸ
22 ὕδωρ, ὅτι οὕτως ἐβουλεύσατο περὶ ὑμῶν Ἀχιτόφελ. Καὶ ἀνέστη
Δαυΐδ καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ὁ μετ’ αὐτοῦ, καὶ διέβησαν τὸν Ἰορδά-
νην ἕως τοῦ φωτὸς τοῦ πρωΐ, ἕως ἑνὸς οὐκ ἔλαβεν ὃς οὐ διῆλθεν
23 τὸν Ἰορδάνην. Καὶ Ἀχιτόφελ εἶδεν ὅτι οὐκ ἐγενήθη ἡ βουλὴ αὐ-
τοῦ, καὶ ἐπέσαξε τὴν ὄνον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀνέστη, καὶ ἀπῆλθεν εἰς
τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ εἰς τὴν πόλιν αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐνετείλατο τῷ οἴκῳ

as the dew falleth upon the ground; and we shall not leave of him, nor of all the men that are with him, even one.

**13** And if he be gathered into a city, then shall all [the men of] Israel take ropes against that city, and we shall drag it into the torrent, that not even a stone be left there.

**14** And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, "Good is the counsel of Hushai the Archite, better indeed than the counsel of Ahithophel." For the Lord had commanded to scatter the good counsel of Ahithophel, that the Lord might bring all evils upon Absalom.

**15** Then said Hushai to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, "Thus and thus hath Ahithophel counseled Absalom and the elders of Israel;

**16** and thus and thus have I counseled. Now therefore, send quickly, and tell David, saying, 'Lodge not this night in Araboth of the wilderness, and indeed, making haste, pass over, lest he swallow up the king, and all the people that are with him.'"

**17** Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stood by the spring Rogel, and the maidservant went forth and told them. And they departed and told King David, for they could not be seen to enter into the city.

**18** And a boy saw them and reported [it] to Absalom. And the two went quickly and entered into the house of a man in Bahurim; and he had a well in his courtyard, and they went down there.

**19** And the woman took [a covering], and she spread the covering upon the mouth of the well, and she cooled Araroth upon it; and no word was known [of them].

**20** And the servants of Absalom came unto the woman at the house, and they said, "Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?" And the woman said unto them, "They have passed a little beyond the water." And they sought, and found them not, and returned to Jerusalem.

**21** And it came to pass, after they had gone, that they came up out of the well and departed, and they told King David, and said to David, "Arise ye, and pass over the water quickly, for thus hath Ahithophel counseled concerning you."

**22** And David arose and all the people that were with him, and they crossed the Jordan until the light of the morning, until not one was left who had not crossed the Jordan.

**23** And Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not done, and he saddled his ass, and arose, and departed to his house, to his city; and he gave charge to his household,
