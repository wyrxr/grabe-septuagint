καθὼς γέγραπται ἐν νόμῳ Μωϋσῇ, ἐν εὐφροσύνῃ, καὶ ἐν ᾠδαῖς
19 διὰ χειρὸς Δαυίδ. Καὶ ἔστησαν οἱ πυλωροὶ ἐπὶ τὰς πύλας οἴκου
20 Κυρίου, καὶ οὐκ εἰσελεύσεται ἀκάθαρτος εἰς πᾶν πρᾶγμα. Καὶ
ἔλαβε τοὺς πατριάρχας, καὶ τοὺς δυνατούς, καὶ τοὺς ἄρχοντας
τοῦ λαοῦ, καὶ πάντα τὸν λαὸν τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἀνεβίβασαν τὸν βα-
σιλέα εἰς οἶκον Κυρίου, καὶ εἰσῆλθε διὰ τῆς πύλης τῆς ἐσωτέρας
εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ ἐκάθισαν τὸν βασιλέα ἐπὶ τὸν
21 θρόνον τῆς βασιλείας. Καὶ ηὐφράνθη πᾶς ὁ λαὸς τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἡ
πόλις ἡσύχασε, καὶ τὴν Γοθολίαν ἐθανάτωσαν μαχαίρᾳ.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΔʹ. XXIV.

1 ὯΝ ἑπτὰ ἐτῶν Ἰωὰς ἐν τῷ βασιλεῦσαι αὐτόν, καὶ τεσσαρά-
κοντα ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ὄνομα τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ
2 Σαβιὰ ἐκ Βηρσαβεέ. Καὶ ἐποίησεν Ἰωὰς τὸ εὐθὲς ἐνώπιον Κυ-
3 ρίου πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας Ἰωδαὲ τοῦ ἱερέως. Καὶ ἔλαβεν ἑαυτῷ Ἰω-
4 δαὲ δύο γυναῖκας, καὶ ἐγέννησαν υἱοὺς καὶ θυγατέρας. Καὶ ἐγέ-
νετο μετὰ ταῦτα, καὶ ἐγένετο ἐπὶ καρδίαν Ἰωὰς ἐπισκευάσαι τὸν
5 οἶκον Κυρίου, καὶ συνήγαγε τοὺς ἱερεῖς, καὶ τοὺς Λευίτας, καὶ εἶ-
πεν αὐτοῖς· ἐξέλθατε εἰς τὰς πόλεις Ἰούδα, καὶ συναγάγετε ἀπὸ
παντὸς Ἰσραὴλ ἀργύριον κατισχῦσαι τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου ἐνιαυτὸν
κατ’ ἐνιαυτόν, καὶ σπεύσατε λαλῆσαι, καὶ οὐκ ἔσπευσαν οἱ Λευῖ-
6 ται. Καὶ ἐκάλεσεν Ἰωὰς ὁ βασιλεὺς τὸν Ἰωδαὲ τὸν ἄρχοντα, καὶ
εἶπεν αὐτῷ· Διατί οὐκ ἐπεσκέψω περὶ τῶν Λευιτῶν τοῦ εἰσενέγ-
και ἀπὸ Ἰούδα καὶ Ἱερουσαλὴμ τὸ κεκριμένον ὑπὸ Μωϋσῆ ἀνθρώ-
που τοῦ Θεοῦ, ὅτε ἐξεκκλησίασε τὸν Ἰσραὴλ εἰς τὴν σκηνὴν τοῦ
7 μαρτυρίου; Ὅτι Γοθολία ἦν ἡ ἄνομος, καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτῆς κατ-
έσπασαν τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Θεοῦ, καί γε τὰ ἅγια οἴκου Κυρίου ἐποίη-
8 σαν τῆς Βααλείμ. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεύς· γενηθήτω γλωσσόκομον,
9 καὶ τεθήτω ἐν πύλῃ οἴκου Κυρίου ἔξω. Καὶ κηρυξάτωσαν ἐν Ἰού-
δᾳ, καὶ ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, εἰσενεγκεῖν τῷ Κυρίῳ, καθὼς εἶπε Μωϋ-
10 σῆς παῖς τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐπὶ τὸν Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ. Καὶ ἔδωκαν
πάντες ἄρχοντες καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαός, καὶ εἰσέφερον καὶ ἐνέβαλον εἰς
11 τὸ γλωσσόκομον ἕως οὗ ἐπληρώθη. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἔφερον τὸ
γλωσσόκομον πρὸς τοὺς προστάτας τοῦ βασιλέως διὰ χειρὸς τῶν
Λευιτῶν, καὶ ὡς εἶδον ὅτι ἐπλεόνασε τὸ ἀργύριον, καὶ ἦλθεν ὁ

**CHAPTER XXIII. OF THE KINGDOMS OF JUDAH. II.**

¹⁸ ...according as it is written in the Law of Moses, with rejoicing and with songs, by the hand of David.

¹⁹ And the gatekeepers took their stand at the gates of the House of the Lord, that no unclean person might enter into any part [thereof].

²⁰ And he took the chiefs of the fathers, and the mighty men, and the rulers of the people, and all the people of the land; and they brought the king up to the House of the Lord. And he came in through the inner gate into the house of the king, and they seated the king upon the royal throne.

²¹ And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was at peace. And Gotholia they slew with the sword.

**CHAPTER XXIV.**

¹ Joash was seven years of age when he began to reign, and forty years he reigned in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Sabia of Beersheba.

² And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the Lord all the days of Jehoiada the priest.

³ And Jehoiada took for himself two wives, and they bare him sons and daughters.

⁴ And it came to pass after these things, that it came into the heart of Joash to repair the House of the Lord.

⁵ And he gathered the priests and the Levites, and said unto them, “Go forth into the cities of Judah, and gather ye silver from all Israel to strengthen the House of the Lord year by year; and make haste to proclaim [this matter].” But the Levites hastened not.

⁶ And Joash the king called for Jehoiada the chief priest, and said unto him, “Wherefore hast thou not overseen the Levites, that they should bring in from Judah and Jerusalem that which was decreed by Moses the man of God, when he gathered Israel unto the Tabernacle of Testimony?”

⁷ For Gotholia, the lawless one, and her sons had broken down the House of God; yea, and the holy things of the House of the Lord did they make for the Baals.

⁸ And the king commanded, saying, “Let there be made a money-chest, and let it be set without the gate of the House of the Lord.”

⁹ And let them make proclamation in Judah and in Jerusalem, to bring unto the Lord, even as Moses the servant of God had enjoined upon Israel in the wilderness.

¹⁰ And all the princes and all the people gave; and they brought in and cast into the money-chest, until it was filled.

¹¹ And it came to pass, when they brought the money-chest unto the king’s overseers by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that the silver did much abound, then came the...
