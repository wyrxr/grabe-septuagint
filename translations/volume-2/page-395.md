ΚΕΦ. ΙΓ´.             ΥΙΟΥ ΑΧΑΛΙΑ.           871
αὑτῷ, καὶ ἀγαπώμενος τῷ Θεῷ ἦν, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὸν ὁ Θεὸς εἰς
βασιλέα ἐπὶ πάντα Ἰσραήλ, καὶ τοῦτον ἐξέκλιναν αἱ γυναῖκες αἱ
ἀλλότριαι.
27 Καὶ ὑμῶν μὴ ἀκουσόμεθα ποιῆσαι τὴν πᾶσαν πονηρίαν ταύτην,
ἀσυνθετήσαι ἐν τῷ Θεῷ ἡμῶν καθίσαι γυναῖκας ἀλλοτρίας.
28 Καὶ ἀπὸ υἱῶν Ἰωιαδὰ τοῦ Ἐλισοῦβ τοῦ ἱερέως τοῦ μεγάλου
νυμφίου τοῦ Σαναβαλλὰτ τοῦ Οὐρανίτου, καὶ ἐξέβρασα αὐτὸν ἀπ᾿
ἐμοῦ.
29 Μνήσθητι αὐτοῖς ὁ Θεὸς ἐπὶ ἀγγιστεία τῆς ἱερατείας καὶ
διαθήκης τῆς ἱερατείας, καὶ τοὺς Λευίτας.
30 Καὶ ἐκαθάρισα αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ πάσης ἀλλοτριώσεως, καὶ ἔστησα
ἐφημερίας τοῖς ἱερεῦσι καὶ τοῖς Λευίταις, ἀνὴρ εἰς τὸ ἔργον αὐτοῦ.
31 Καὶ τὸ δῶρον τῶν ξυλοφόρων ἐν καιροῖς ἀπὸ χρόνων, καὶ ἐν
τοῖς βαχουρίαις, μνήσθητί μου ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν εἰς ἀγαθωσύνην.

#### NEHEMIAH CHAPTER XIII

<sup>26</sup> like unto him, and he was beloved of God, and God made him king over all Israel; nevertheless, even him did the foreign women cause to sin.
<sup>27</sup> And shall we then hearken unto you to commit all this great wickedness, to transgress against our God by taking foreign wives?

<sup>28</sup> And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite; therefore I drove him from me.
<sup>29</sup> Remember them, O God, for the defiling of the priesthood, and for the covenant of the priesthood, yea, and the Levites.

<sup>30</sup> Thus I cleansed them from all foreignness, and I set the courses for the priests and for the Levites, each man for his own work.
<sup>31</sup> And for the wood offering at its appointed times, and for the firstfruits, remember me, O our God, for good.
