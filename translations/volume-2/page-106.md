ΚΕΦ. ΙΗʹ.         ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Βʹ.         582
33 δάριον, οἱ ἐχθροὶ τοῦ κυρίου μου τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ πάντες ὅσοι
ἐπανέστησαν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν εἰς κακά. Καὶ ἐταράχθη ὁ βασιλεύς, καὶ
ἀνέβη εἰς τὸ ὑπερῶον τῆς πύλης, καὶ ἔκλαυσε, καὶ οὕτως εἶπεν ἐν τῷ
πορεύεσθαι αὐτόν· υἱέ μου ᾿Αβεσσαλώμ, υἱέ μου, υἱέ μου, ᾿Αβεσσαλώμ,
τίς δώῃ τὸν θάνατόν μου ἀντὶ σοῦ; ᾿Αβεσσαλώμ, υἱέ μου, υἱέ μου.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΘ´. ΧΙΧ.

1 ΚΑΙ ἀνηγγέλη τῷ ᾿Ιωάβ, λέγοντες· ᾿Ιδοὺ ὁ βασιλεὺς κλαίει
2 καὶ πενθεῖ ἐπὶ ᾿Αβεσσαλώμ. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἡ σωτηρία ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ
   ἐκείνῃ εἰς πένθος παντὶ τῷ λαῷ, ὅτι ἤκουσεν ὁ λαὸς ἐν τῇ ἡ-
   μέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ λέγων, ὅτι λυπεῖται ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐπὶ τῷ υἱῷ αὐτοῦ.
3 Καὶ διεκλέπτετο ὁ λαὸς ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ τοῦ εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὴν
   πόλιν, καθὼς διακλέπτεται ὁ λαὸς οἱ αἰσχυνόμενοι ἐν τῷ φυγείν
4 αὐτοὺς ἐν πολέμῳ. Καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐπέκρυψε τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ·
   καὶ ἔκραξεν ὁ βασιλεὺς (ἐν) φωνῇ μεγάλῃ, λέγων· υἱέ μου ᾿Αβεσ-
5 σαλώμ, ᾿Αβεσσαλώμ, υἱέ μου, υἱέ μου. Καὶ εἰσῆλθεν ᾿Ιωὰβ πρὸς τὸν
   βασιλέα εἰς τὸν οἶκον, καὶ εἶπε· κατήσχυνας σήμερον τὸ πρόσωπον πάν-
   των τῶν δούλων σου τῶν ἐξαιρούντων σε σήμερον, καὶ τὴν ψυχὴν
   τῶν υἱῶν σου, καὶ τῶν θυγατέρων σου, καὶ ψυχὴν τῶν γυναικῶν
6 σου, καὶ ψυχὴν τῶν παλλακῶν σου, τοῦ ἀγαπᾶν τοὺς μισοῦντάς σε,
   καὶ μισεῖν τοὺς ἀγαπῶντάς σε. Καὶ ἀνήγγειλας σήμερον, ὅτι οὐκ
   εἰσὶν οἱ ἄρχοντές σου, οὐδὲ παῖδες· ὅτι ἔγνωκα σήμερον, ὅτι εἰ
   ᾿Αβεσσαλὼμ ἔζη, πάντες ἡμεῖς νεκροὶ σήμερον, ὅτι τότε τὸ εὐθὲς
7 ἦν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς σου. Καὶ νῦν ἀναστὰς ἔξελθε, καὶ λάλησον εἰς
   τὴν καρδίαν τῶν δούλων σου, ὅτι ἐν Κυρίῳ ὤμοσα, ὅτι εἰ μὴ ἐκ-
   πορεύσῃ σήμερον, εἰ αὐλισθήσεται μετὰ σοῦ ἀνὴρ τὴν νύκτα ταύ-
   την. Καὶ ἐπίγνωθι σεαυτῷ, καὶ κακόν σοι τοῦτο ὑπὲρ πᾶν τὸ κα-
8 κὸν τὸ ἐπελθὸν σοι ἐκ νεότητός σου ἕως τοῦ νῦν. Καὶ ἀνέστη ὁ
   βασιλεύς, καὶ ἐκάθισεν ἐν τῇ πύλῃ, καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ἀνήγγειλαν,
   λέγοντες· ἰδοὺ ὁ βασιλεὺς κάθηται ἐν τῇ πύλῃ. Καὶ εἰσῆλθε πᾶς
   ὁ λαὸς κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ βασιλέως· καὶ ᾿Ισραὴλ ἔφυγεν ἀνὴρ
9 εἰς τὰ σκηνώματα αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἦν πᾶς ὁ λαὸς κρινόμενος ἐν πά-
   σαις φυλαῖς ᾿Ισραήλ, λέγοντες· ὁ βασιλεὺς Δαυὶδ ἐῤῥύσατο ἡμᾶς
   ἐκ χειρὸς (ἀπὸ) πάντων τῶν ἐχθρῶν ἡμῶν, καὶ αὐτὸς ἐῤῥύσατο ἡμᾶς
   ἐκ χειρὸς ἀλλοφύλων, καὶ νῦν πέφευγεν ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἀπὸ

**18:33** ...the young man be, even the enemies of my lord the King, and all they who rise up against him for evil.'

And the King was troubled, and went up to the upper chamber of the gate, and wept; and as he walked, thus he said: 'My son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! Who would grant me my death instead of thee? Absalom, my son, my son!'

### Chapter 19

**1** And it was announced unto Joab, saying, 'Behold, the King weepeth,

**2** and mourneth for Absalom.' And the deliverance in that day was turned into mourning for all the people; for the people heard on that day, saying, 'The King is grieved for his son.'

**3** And the people stole away in that day to enter into the city, even as a people ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.

**4** And the King covered his face; and the King cried out with a great voice, saying, 'My son Absalom!

**5** Absalom, my son, my son!' And Joab came in unto the King into the house, and said, 'Thou hast shamed this day the face of all thy servants who have delivered thee this day, and the life of thy sons, and of thy daughters, and the life of thy wives,

**6** and the life of thy concubines; for thou dost love them that hate thee, and hate them that love thee. And thou hast declared this day, that thy princes are as nothing, nor thy servants [of any account]; for I know this day, that if Absalom had lived, then all of us would be dead this day; for then that which was right was in thy sight.

**7** Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak to the heart of thy servants; for I have sworn by the Lord, that if thou goest not forth this day, then shall no man lodge with thee this night. And know thou, for thy part, that this evil shall be unto thee above all the evil that hath befallen thee from thy youth until now.'

**8** And the King arose, and sat in the gate. And it was announced unto all the people, saying, 'Behold, the King sitteth in the gate.' And all the people came in before the face of the King. And Israel fled, every man

**9** to his tents. And all the people were disputing among all the tribes of Israel, saying, 'King David delivered us from the hand of all our enemies, and he himself delivered us from the hand of the Philistines; and now hath he fled from the land, and from
