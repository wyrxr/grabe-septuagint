τὰς παρεμβολὰς αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἔλαβεν Δαυὶδ τὴν κεφαλὴν τοῦ ἀλ- 54
λοφύλου, καὶ ἤνεγκεν αὐτὴν εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ τὰ σκεύη αὐ-
τοῦ ἔθηκεν ἐν τῷ σκηνώματι αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ὡς εἶδε Σαοὺλ τὸν 55
Δαυὶδ ἐκπορευόμενον εἰς ἀπάντησιν τοῦ ἀλλοφύλου, εἶπε πρὸς Ἀ-
βενὴρ τὸν ἄρχοντα τῆς δυνάμεως, Υἱὸς τίνος ὁ νεανίσκος οὗτος;
καὶ εἶπεν Ἀβενήρ, Ζῇ ἡ ψυχή σου, βασιλεῦ, εἰ οἶδα. Καὶ εἶπεν 56
ὁ βασιλεύς, ἐπερώτησον σύ, υἱὸς τίνος ὁ νεανίσκος οὗτος. Καὶ 57
ὡς ἐπέστρεψε Δαυὶδ τοῦ πατάξαι τὸν ἀλλόφυλον, καὶ παρέ-
λαβεν αὐτὸν Ἀβενήρ, καὶ εἰσήγαγεν αὐτὸν ἐνώπιον Σαούλ, καὶ ἡ
κεφαλὴ τοῦ ἀλλοφύλου ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐ- 58
τὸν Σαούλ, Υἱὸς τίνος εἶ παιδάριον; καὶ εἶπε Δαυίδ, Υἱὸς δού-
λου σου Ἰεσσαὶ τοῦ Βηθλεεμίτου.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΗʹ. XVIII.

ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο ὡς συνετέλεσε λαλῶν πρὸς Σαούλ, καὶ ἡ ψυ- 1
χὴ Ἰωνάθαν συνδεδέχθη τῇ ψυχῇ Δαυίδ, καὶ ἠγάπησεν αὐτὸν Ἰω-
νάθαν κατὰ τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἔλαβεν αὐτὸν Σαοὺλ ἐν τῇ 2
ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ. καὶ οὐκ ἔδωκεν αὐτὸν ἐπιστρέψαι ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ
πατρὸς αὐτοῦ. Καὶ διέθετο Ἰωνάθαν καὶ Δαυίδ, ἐν τῷ ἀγαπᾶν 3
αὐτὸν κατὰ τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐξεδύσατο Ἰωνάθαν τὸν ἐπαν- 4
δύτην τὸν ἐπάνω, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὸν τῷ Δαυίδ, καὶ τὸν μανδύαν
αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἕως τῆς ῥομφαίας αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἕως τοῦ τόξου αὐτοῦ,
καὶ ἕως τῆς ζώνης αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐξεπορεύετο Δαυὶδ ἐν πᾶσιν οἷς 5
ἀπέστειλεν αὐτὸν Σαούλ· συνῆκεν· καὶ κατέστησεν αὐτὸν Σαοὺλ
ἐπὶ τοὺς ἄνδρας τοῦ πολέμου· καὶ ἤρεσεν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς παντὸς
τοῦ λαοῦ, καίγε ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς δούλων Σαούλ. Καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐν 6
τῷ εἰσπορεύεσθαι αὐτοὺς ἐν τῷ ἐπιστρέφειν Δαυὶδ ἀπὸ τοῦ πα-
τάξαι τὸν ἀλλόφυλον· καὶ ἐξῆλθον αἱ χορεύουσαι εἰς συνάντησιν
Δαυὶδ ἐκ πασῶν τῶν πόλεων Ἰσραήλ, καὶ χορεύουσαι εἰς ἀπάν-
τησιν Σαοὺλ τοῦ βασιλέως ἐν τυμπάνοις, καὶ χαρμοσύνῃ, καὶ ἐν
κυμβάλοις. Καὶ ἐξῆλθον αἱ γυναῖκες αἱ παίζουσαι, καὶ ἔλεγον, 7
ἐπάταξε Σαοὺλ ἐν χιλιάσιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ Δαυὶδ ἐν μυριάσιν αὐτοῦ.
Καὶ πονηρὸν ἐφάνη τὸ ῥῆμα ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς Σαοὺλ περὶ τοῦ λόγου, 8
καὶ εἶπεν, ἔδωκαν τῷ Δαυὶδ τὰς μυριάδας, καὶ ἐμοὶ ἔδωκαν τὰς
χιλιάδας· καὶ τί αὐτῷ πλὴν ἡ βασιλεία; Καὶ ἦν Σαοὺλ ὑποβλε- 9

their camps.
54 And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; and his armor he placed in his dwelling.
55 And when Saul saw David going forth to meet the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the commander of the army, "Whose son is this youth?" And Abner answered, "As thy soul liveth, O king, I know not."
56 And the king said, "Do thou inquire, whose son this youth is."
57 And as David returned from smiting the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul, and the head of the Philistine was in his hand.
58 And Saul said unto him, "Whose son art thou, O young man?" And David answered, "I am the son of thy servant Jesse, the Bethlehemite."

CHAPTER XVIII.
1 And it came to pass, when he had ceased speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.
2 And Saul took him that day, and would not suffer him to return any more to his father's house.
3 Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.
4 And Jonathan stripped himself of the upper mantle that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his cloak, and even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.
5 And David went forth whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was pleasing in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants.
6 And it came to pass, when they were coming home, as David was returning from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the dancing women came out of all the cities of Israel, to meet David, and dancing to meet Saul the king, with tambourines, with joy, and with cymbals.
7 And the women who played [instruments and sang] answered one another as they played, and said, "Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands."
8 And this saying displeased Saul, and it seemed evil in his eyes; and he said, "They have ascribed unto David tens of thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands; and what more can he have but the kingdom?"
9 And Saul eyed David from that day and onward.
