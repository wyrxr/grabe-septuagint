    φθεγγομένους ἐν κινύραις, καὶ ἐν νάβλαις, καὶ ἐν κυμβάλοις. Καὶ
    ἐγένετο ὁ ἀριθμὸς αὐτῶν κατὰ κεφαλὴν αὐτῶν ἐργαζομένων ἐν
    2 τοῖς ἔργοις αὐτῶν. Υἱοὶ Ἀσάφ· Ζαχχούρ, καὶ Ἰωσήφ, καὶ Να-

1 And David the king, and the captains of the host, did set apart for the service the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who did prophesy with lyres, with harps, and with cymbals. And the number of them, according to their head, who labored in their works, was made manifest.

2 The sons of Asaph: Zaccur, and Joseph, and Nethaniah, and Ishiiah; the sons of Asaph, [who were] attendants unto the king.

3 Unto Jeduthun: the sons of Jeduthun, Gedaliah, Zeri, and Jeshaiah, and Shimei, and Hashabiah, and Mattathiah; six [sons were these] with their father Jeduthun, who did make music with the lyre, [offering] thanksgiving and praise unto the Lord.
