τὸν εἰς τὴν πλατείαν τῆς πύλης τῆς φάραγγος, καὶ ἐλάλησεν ἐπὶ
7 τὴν καρδίαν αὐτῶν, λέγων· ἰσχύσατε, καὶ ἀνδρίζεσθε, μὴ φοβηθῆτε,
μηδὲ πτοηθῆτε ἀπὸ προσώπου βασιλέως Ἀσσούρ, καὶ ἀπὸ
προσώπου παντὸς τοῦ ἔθνους τοῦ μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ, ὅτι μεθ᾽ ἡμῶν πλείονες
8 ἢ μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ· μετὰ αὐτοῦ βραχίονες σάρκινοι, μεθ᾽ ἡμῶν δὲ
Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν τοῦ σῴζειν, καὶ τοῦ πολεμεῖν τὸν πόλεμον
ἡμῶν· καὶ κατεθάρσησεν ὁ λαὸς ἐπὶ τοῖς λόγοις Ἑζεκίου βασιλέως
9 Ἰούδα. Καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα ἀπέστειλε Σενναχηρεὶμ βασιλεὺς
Ἀσσυρίων τοὺς παῖδας ἑαυτοῦ ἐπὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ αὐτὸς ἐπὶ
Λαχείρ, καὶ πᾶσα ἡ στρατιὰ μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀπέστειλε πρὸς Ἑζε-
κίαν βασιλέα Ἰούδα, καὶ πρὸς πάντα Ἰούδαν τὸν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ,
10 λέγων· οὕτως λέγει Σενναχηρεὶμ ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων· ἐπὶ τίνι
11 ὑμεῖς πεποίθατε, καὶ κάθησθε ἐν τῇ περιοχῇ ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ; Οὐχὶ
Ἑζεκίας ἀπατᾷ ὑμᾶς τοῦ παραδοῦναι ὑμᾶς εἰς θάνατον, καὶ εἰς
λιμόν, καὶ εἰς δίψαν, λέγων· Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν σώσει ἡμᾶς ἐκ
12 χειρὸς βασιλέως Ἀσσούρ; Οὐχ οὗτός ἐστιν Ἑζεκίας, ὃς περιεῖλε
τὰ θυσιαστήρια αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰ ὑψηλὰ αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπε τῷ Ἰούδα,
καὶ τοῖς κατοικοῦσιν Ἱερουσαλήμ, λέγων· κατέναντι τοῦ θυσια-
13 στηρίου τούτου προσκυνήσετε, καὶ ἐπ᾽ αὐτοῦ θυμιάσετε; Οὐ γνώ-
σεσθε τί ἐγὼ ἐποίησα, καὶ οἱ πατέρες μου πᾶσι τοῖς λαοῖς τῶν
χωρῶν; μὴ δυνάμενοι ἐδύναντο θεοὶ τῶν ἐθνῶν πάσης τῆς γῆς σῶσαι
14 τὸν λαὸν αὐτῶν ἐκ χειρός μου; Τίς ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς θεοῖς τῶν
ἐθνῶν τούτων, οὓς ἐξωλέθρευσαν οἱ πατέρες μου; μὴ ἠδύναντο σῶσαι
τὸν λαὸν ἑαυτῶν ἐκ χειρός μου, ὅτι δυνήσεται ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν
15 σῶσαι ὑμᾶς ἐκ χειρός μου; Νῦν οὖν μὴ ἀπατάτω ὑμᾶς Ἑζεκίας,
καὶ μὴ πεποιθέναι ὑμᾶς ποιείτω κατὰ ταῦτα, καὶ μὴ πιστεύετε
αὐτῷ, ὅτι οὐ μὴ δύνηται ὁ Θεὸς παντὸς ἔθνους καὶ βασιλείας τοῦ
σῶσαι τὸν λαὸν ἑαυτοῦ ἐκ χειρός μου, καὶ ἐκ χειρὸς πατέρων μου,
16 ὅτι Θεὸς ὑμῶν οὐ μὴ σώσει ὑμᾶς ἐκ χειρός μου. Καὶ ἔτι ἐλάλησαν
οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ Κύριον Θεόν, καὶ ἐπὶ Ἑζεκίαν παῖδα αὐτοῦ.
17 Καὶ βιβλίον ἔγραψεν ὀνειδίζειν τὸν Κύριον Θεὸν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ
εἶπε περὶ αὐτοῦ, λέγων· ὡς θεοὶ τῶν ἐθνῶν τῆς γῆς οὐκ ἐξείλαντο
τοὺς λαοὺς ἑαυτῶν ἐκ χειρός μου, οὕτως οὐ μὴ ἐξέληται ὁ Θεὸς
18 Ἑζεκίου λαὸν ἐμαυτοῦ ἐκ χειρός μου. Καὶ ἐβόησε φωνῇ μεγάλη
Ἰουδαϊστὶ ἐπὶ τὸν λαὸν Ἱερουσαλήμ τὸν ἐπὶ τοῦ τείχους, τοῦ βοηθῆσαι
αὐτοῖς, καὶ κατασκάσαι, ὅπως προκαταλάβωνται τὴν πόλιν·

### Chapter 32

⁶...unto him in the broad place of the gate of the valley, and he spake unto their heart, saying,
⁷ "Be strong and play the man; be not afraid, neither be dismayed before the face of the king of Asshur, nor before the face of all the nation that is with him; for with us are more
⁸ than with him. With him are arms of flesh, but with us is the Lord our God, to save us and to fight our battles." And the people took heart at the words of Hezekiah, king of Judah.

⁹ And after these things, Sennacherib king of the Assyrians sent his servants unto Jerusalem (for he himself was at Lachish, with all his army), and he sent unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that was in Jerusalem,
¹⁰ saying, "Thus saith Sennacherib, the king of the Assyrians: On what [then] do ye trust, that ye remain under siege in Jerusalem?
¹¹ Hath not Hezekiah beguiled you, that he might deliver you over unto death, and unto famine, and unto thirst, by saying, 'The Lord our God shall save us from the hand of the king of Asshur'?
¹² Is not this Hezekiah, who hath taken away his altars and his high places, and hath said unto Judah and unto the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, 'Before this altar shall ye worship, and upon it shall ye burn incense?'
¹³ Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of all the earth able to save their people from my hand?
¹⁴ Who among all the gods of these nations, whom my fathers utterly destroyed, were able to save their own people from my hand, that your God should be able to save you from my hand?
¹⁵ Now, therefore, let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor cause you to trust in these things, and believe him not; for no god of any nation or kingdom shall in any wise be able to save his people from my hand, nor from the hand of my fathers;
¹⁶ for your God shall in no wise save you from my hand." And yet more did his servants speak against the Lord God, and against Hezekiah, His servant.
¹⁷ And he wrote a letter to rail upon the Lord God of Israel, and spake concerning Him, saying, "As the gods of the nations of the earth delivered not their own peoples from my hand, so also shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver the people, even my own, from my hand."
¹⁸ And he cried with a great voice in the Judean tongue unto the people of Jerusalem who were upon the wall, [intending] to help them, and to cast them down [in spirit], that they might take the city.
