ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Γ΄.

ΚΕΦ. ΙϚ΄. XVI.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου ἐν χειρὶ Ἰησοῦ υἱοῦ Ἀνανί, πρὸς Βαασά·
2 Ἀνθ’ ὧν ὕψωσά σε ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἔδωκά σε ἡγούμενον ἐπὶ τὸν λαόν μου Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐπορεύθης ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ Ἱεροβοάμ, καὶ ἐξήμαρτες τὸν λαόν μου Ἰσραήλ, τοῦ παροργίσαι με ἐν
3 τοῖς ματαίοις αὐτῶν, ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐξεγείρω ὀπίσω Βαασά, καὶ ὀπί- σθεν τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ, καὶ δώσω τὸν οἶκόν σου ὡς τὸν οἶκον Ἰεροβοὰμ υἱοῦ Ναβάτ.
4 Τὸν τεθνηκότα τοῦ Βαασὰ ἐν τῇ πόλει καταφάγονται οἱ κύνες, καὶ τὸν τεθνηκότα αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ καταφάγονται αὐτὸν τὰ πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ.
5 Καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Βαασά, καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησε, καὶ δυναστείαὶ αὐτοῦ, οὐχὶ ταῦτα γεγραμμένα ἐπὶ βιβλίῳ λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν τῶν βασιλέων Ἰσραήλ;
6 Καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Βαασὰ μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ καὶ θάπτεται ἐν Θερσᾶ, καὶ βασιλεύει Ἠλὰ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀντ’ αὐτοῦ (ἐν τῷ εἰκοστῷ ἔτει βασιλέως Ἀσά).
7 Καὶ ἐν χειρὶ Ἰησοῦ υἱοῦ Ἀνανὶ τοῦ προφήτου ἐλάλησε Κύριος ἐπὶ Βαασά, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπὶ πᾶσαν τὴν κακίαν ἣν ἐποίησεν ἐνώπιον Κυρίου, τοῦ παροργίσαι αὐτὸν ἐν τοῖς ἔργοις τῶν χειρῶν αὐτοῦ, τοῦ εἶναι καθὼς ὁ οἶκος Ἱεροβοάμ, καὶ ὑπὲρ τοῦ πατάξαι αὐτόν.
8 Ἐν ἔτει εἰκοστῷ καὶ ἔκτῳ ἐπὶ τοῦ Ἀσὰ βασιλέως Ἰούδα ἐβασίλευσεν Ἠλὰ υἱὸς Βαασὰ ἐπὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐν Θερσᾷ δύο ἔτη.
9 Καὶ συνέστρεφεν ἐπ’ αὐτὸν παῖς αὐτοῦ Ζαμβρὶ ὁ ἄρχων τῆς ἡμίσους τῆς ἵππου, καὶ αὐτὸς ἦν ἐν Θερσᾷ πίνων, μεθύων ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ Ἀρασᾶ τοῦ οἰκονόμου ἐν Θερσᾷ.
10 Καὶ εἰσῆλθε Ζαμβρί, καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτόν, καὶ ἐθανάτωσεν αὐτόν, ἐν ἔτει εἰκοστῷ καὶ ἑβδόμῳ τοῦ Ἀσὰ βασιλέως Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν ἀντ’ αὐτοῦ.
11 Καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐν τῷ βασιλεῦσαι αὐτόν, ἐν τῷ καθίσαι αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τοῦ θρόνου αὐτοῦ, ἐπάταξεν ὅλον τὸν οἶκον (αὐτοῦ) τοῦ Βαασά· οὐχ ὑπέλιπεν αὐτῷ οὐροῦντα πρὸς τοῖχον, καὶ ἀγχιστεῖς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἑταῖρον αὐτοῦ.
12 Καὶ ἐξέτριψε Ζαμβρὶ ὅλον τὸν οἶκον Βαασὰ κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα Κυρίου, ὃ ἐλάλησεν ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον Βαασά, καὶ πρὸς Ἰησοῦ τὸν προφήτην,
13 περὶ πασῶν τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν Βαασά, καὶ Ἠλὰ τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ, ὡς ἥμαρτον καὶ ὡς ἐξήμαρτον τὸν Ἰσραήλ, τοῦ παροργίσαι Κύριον Θεὸν τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τοῖς ματαίοις αὐτῶν.
14 Καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν

### Kings III, Chapter 16

**1** And there came a word of the Lord by the hand of Jehu the son of Hanani unto Baasha, saying:

**2** "Forasmuch as I exalted thee from the dust, and made thee a leader over My people Israel, yet thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam, and hast caused My people Israel to sin, that they might provoke Me to anger with their vain [idols];
**3** behold, I will utterly sweep away Baasha, and the house of his [posterity]; and I will make thy house like unto the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
**4** Him that dieth of Baasha in the city, the dogs shall devour; and him that dieth of his [house] in the field, the fowls of the heaven shall devour him."

**5** Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and all that he wrought, and his mighty deeds, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
**6** So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah; and Elah his son reigned in his stead (in the twentieth year of King Asa).
**7** Moreover, by the hand of Jehu the son of Hanani the prophet, came the word of the Lord against Baasha, and against his house, and against all the evil which he had wrought in the sight of the Lord, to provoke Him to anger with the works of his hands, that his house might be as the house of Jeroboam, and because he smote him.

**8** In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah the son of Baasha began to reign over Israel in Tirzah, and reigned two years.
**9** And his servant Zimri, the captain of half his chariots, conspired against him, while he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, the steward in Tirzah.
**10** And Zimri went in, and smote him, and slew him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah; and he reigned in his stead.
**11** And it came to pass, when he began to reign, and when he sat on his throne, that he smote all the house (of him) of Baasha: he left him not a single male, nor any kinsmen of his, nor his friends.
**12** Thus Zimri destroyed all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the Lord, which He spake against the house of Baasha by Jehu the prophet,
**13** for all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, which they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger with their vain [idols].
**14** Now the rest of the acts of
