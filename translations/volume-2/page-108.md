ΚΕΦ. ΙΘ´. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Β´. 584
22 ρίου; Καὶ εἶπε Δαυίδ· τί ἐμοὶ καὶ ὑμῖν, υἱοὶ Σαρουίας, ὅτι γίνεσθέ μοι
   σήμερον εἰς ἐπίβουλον; σήμερον οὐ θανατωθήσεται τις ἀνὴρ ἐξ Ἰσραήλ,
23 ὅτι οὐκ οἶδα εἰ σήμερον (ἐμοὶ) ἐγὼ βασιλεύω ἐπὶ τὸν Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ εἶπεν
   ὁ βασιλεὺς πρὸς Σεμεεί· οὐ μὴ ἀποθάνῃς. Καὶ ὤμοσεν αὐτῷ ὁ
24 βασιλεύς. Καὶ Μεμφιβοσθαὶ υἱὸς Σαοὺλ κατέβη εἰς ἀπάντησιν τοῦ
   βασιλέως, καὶ οὐκ ἐθεράπευσε τοὺς πόδας αὑτοῦ, οὐδὲ ὠνυχίσατο,
   οὐδὲ ἐποίησε τὸν μύστακα αὑτοῦ, καὶ τὰ ἱμάτια αὑτοῦ οὐκ
   ἔπλυνεν ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέρας ἧς ἀπῆλθεν ὁ βασιλεὺς ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας
25 ἧς παρεγένετο ἐν εἰρήνῃ. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὅτε εἰσῆλθεν εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ
   εἰς ἀπάντησιν τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ εἶπεν αὑτῷ ὁ βασιλεύς·
26 τί ὅτι οὐκ ἐπορεύθης μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ, Μεμφιβοσθαί; Καὶ εἶπε
   πρὸς αὐτὸν Μεμφιβοσθαί· κύριέ μου βασιλεῦ, ὁ δοῦλός μου παρελογίσατό
   με, ὅτι εἶπεν ὁ παῖς σου αὑτῷ· ἐπίσαξον μοι τὴν ὄνον
   καὶ ἐπιβῶ ἐπ᾿ αὑτήν, καὶ πορεύσομαι μετὰ τοῦ βασιλέως, ὅτι
27 χωλὸς ὁ δοῦλός σου· καὶ μεθώδευσεν ἐν τῷ δούλῳ σου πρὸς τὸν
   κύριόν μου τὸν βασιλέα· καὶ ὁ κύριός μου ὁ βασιλεὺς ὡς ἄγγελος
28 τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ ποίησον τὸ ἀγαθὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς σου. Ὅτι οὐκ
   ἦν πᾶς ὁ οἶκος τοῦ πατρός μου, ἀλλ᾿ ἢ ὅτι ἄνδρες θανάτου τῷ
   κυρίῳ μου τῷ βασιλεῖ· καὶ ἔθηκας τὸν δοῦλόν σου ἐν τοῖς ἐσθίουσι
   τὴν τράπεζάν σου· καὶ τί ἐστι μοι ἔτι δικαίωμα, καὶ τοῦ
   κεκραγέναι με, ἔτι πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα;
29 Καὶ εἶπεν αὑτῷ ὁ βασιλεύς· ἵνατί λαλεῖς ἔτι τοὺς λόγους σου;
   εἶπον· σὺ καὶ Σιβὰ διελέσθε τὸν ἀγρόν.
30 Καὶ εἶπε Μεμφιβοσθαὶ πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα· καὶ τὰ πάντα λαβέτω
   μετὰ τὸ παραγενέσθαι τὸν κύριόν μου τὸν βασιλέα ἐν εἰρήνῃ εἰς τὸν οἶκον
   αὑτοῦ.
31 Καὶ Βερζελλεὶ ὁ Γαλααδίτης κατέβη ἐκ Ῥωγελλείμ, καὶ διέβη
   μετὰ τοῦ βασιλέως τὸν Ἰορδάνην ἐκπέμψαι αὐτὸν τὸν Ἰορδάνην.
32 Καὶ Βερζελλεὶ ἀνὴρ πρεσβύτερος σφόδρα, υἱὸς ὀγδοήκοντα ἐτῶν,
   καὶ αὐτὸς διέθρεψε τὸν βασιλέα ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ αὑτὸν ἐν Μααναείμ,
   ὅτι ἀνὴρ μέγας ἐστὶ σφόδρα.
33 Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς πρὸς Βερζελλεί· σὺ διαβήσῃ μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ,
   καὶ διαθρέψω τὸν οἶκόν σου μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ.
34 Καὶ εἶπε Βερζελλεὶ πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα· πόσαι ἡμέραι ἐτῶν ζωῆς μου,
   ὅτι ἀναβήσομαι μετὰ τοῦ βασιλέως εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ;
35 Υἱὸς ὀγδοήκοντα ἐτῶν ἐγώ εἰμι σήμερον, εἰ γνώσομαι ἀναμέσον
   ἀγαθοῦ καὶ κακοῦ; εἰ γεύσεται ὁ δοῦλός σου ἔτι ἢ φάγομαι ἢ πίομαι;
   ἢ ἀκούσομαι ἔτι φωνὴν ἀδόντων ἢ ἀδουσῶν; καὶ ἵνατί ἔσται ὁ δοῦλός
   σου ἔτι καὶ εἰς φόρτιον

**19:22** And David said, 'What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye are become mine adversaries this day? No man of Israel shall be put to death this day,

**23** for I know not if I myself reign over Israel this day.' And the King said unto Shimei, 'Thou shalt not die.' And the King swore unto him.

**24** And Mephibosheth, the son of Saul, came down to meet the King, and had not dressed his feet, nor pared his nails, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his garments, from the day the King departed until the day

**25** he came in peace. And it came to pass, when he came into Jerusalem to meet the King, that the King said unto him,

**26** 'Why is it that thou wentest not with me, Mephibosheth?' And Mephibosheth said unto him, 'My lord, O King, my servant did deceive me; for thy servant [Mephibosheth] said unto him [Ziba], "Saddle for me the ass, that I may ride thereon and go with the King, for thy servant is lame."

**27** And he did deal craftily against thy servant unto my lord the King. But my lord the King is as an angel of God,

**28** and do thou that which is good in thine eyes. For all the house of my father were but men appointed unto death before my lord the King; yet didst thou set thy servant among those who eat at thy table. And what right have I yet, or to what end should I cry out further unto the King?'

**29** And the King said unto him, 'Wherefore speakest thou yet thy words? I have said, "Thou and Ziba shall divide the field."'

**30** And Mephibosheth said unto the King, 'Yea, let him take all, after my lord the King is come in peace unto his own house.'

**31** And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and crossed over the Jordan with the King, to convey him over the Jordan.

**32** Now Barzillai was a very aged man, fourscore years old. And he himself had nourished the King in his house, even him, in Mahanaim, for he was a very great man.

**33** And the King said unto Barzillai, 'Thou shalt pass over with me, and I will nourish thy household with me in Jerusalem.'

**34** And Barzillai said unto the King, 'How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the King unto Jerusalem?

**35** I am this day fourscore years old. Shall I discern between good and evil? Shall thy servant yet taste, or shall I eat, or shall I drink? Or shall I yet hear the voice of singing men or singing women? And why should thy servant yet be also a burden
