3 Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ ὁ βασιλεύς· τί θέλεις Ἐσθήρ; καὶ τί σοι ἐστὶ τὸ
4 ἀξίωμα; ἕως τοῦ ἡμίσους τῆς βασιλείας μου, καὶ ἔσται σοι. Εἶπε
   δὲ Ἐσθήρ· ἡμέρα μοι σήμερον ἐπίσημός ἐστιν· εἰ οὖν δοκεῖ τῷ βα-
5 σιλεῖ, ἐλθέτω ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ Ἀμὰν εἰς τὴν δοχήν, ἣν ποιήσω σή-
   μερον. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεύς· κατασπεύσατε Ἀμάν, ποιῆσαι τὸν
6 λόγον Ἐσθήρ. Καὶ παρεγίνοντο ἀμφότεροι ἐπὶ τὴν δοχήν, ἣν εἶ-
   πεν Ἐσθήρ. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς πρὸς Ἐσθὴρ ἐν τῷ πότῳ τοῦ
7 οἴνου· τί ἐστιν Ἐσθὴρ ἡ βασίλισσα; καὶ ἔσται σοι ὅσα ἀξιοῖς. Καὶ
8 εἶπεν Ἐσθήρ· τὸ αἴτημά μου, καὶ τὸ ἀξίωμά μου· εἰ εὗρον χάριν
   ἐναντίον τοῦ βασιλέως, ἐλθάτω ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ Ἀμὰν ἐπὶ τὴν αὔ-
9 ριον εἰς τὴν δοχήν, ἣν ποιήσω αὐτοῖς, καὶ αὔριον γὰρ ποιήσω τὰ
   αὐτά. Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Ἀμὰν ἀπὸ τοῦ βασιλέως ὑπερχαρὴς εὐφραι-
10 νόμενος· ἐν δὲ τῷ ἰδεῖν Μαρδοχαῖον τὸν Ἰουδαῖον ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ, ἐθυ-
   μώθη Ἀμὰν σφόδρα. Καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὰ ἴδια, καὶ ἐκάλεσε τοὺς
11 φίλους, καὶ Σωσάραν τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὑπέδειξεν αὐτοῖς τὸν
   πλοῦτον αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὴν δόξαν ἣν ὁ βασιλεὺς περιέθηκεν αὐτῷ, καὶ
12 ὡς ἐποίησεν αὐτὸν πρῶτον ἡγεῖσθαι τῆς βασιλείας. Καὶ εἶπεν
   Ἀμάν· οὐ κέκληκεν Ἐσθὴρ ἡ βασίλισσα μετὰ τοῦ βασιλέως οὐδέ-
13 να εἰς τὴν δοχήν, ἀλλ᾿ ἢ ἐμέ, καὶ εἰς τὴν αὔριον κέκλημαι. Καὶ
   ταῦτά μοι οὐκ ἀρέσκει, ὅταν ἴδω Μαρδοχαῖον τὸν Ἰουδαῖον ἐν τῇ
14 αὐλῇ. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτὸν Σωσάρα ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ, καὶ οἱ φίλοι·
   κοπτήτω σοι ξύλον πηχῶν πεντήκοντα, ὄρθρου δὲ εἶπον τῷ βασιλεῖ,
   καὶ κρεμασθήτω Μαρδοχαῖος ἐπὶ τοῦ ξύλου· σὺ δὲ εἴσελθε εἰς τὴν
   δοχὴν σὺν τῷ βασιλεῖ, καὶ εὐφραίνου. Καὶ ἤρεσε τὸ ῥῆμα τῷ
   Ἀμάν, καὶ ἡτοιμάσθη τὸ ξύλον.

ΚΕΦ. Ϛ΄. VI.

1 Ὁ δὲ Κύριος ἀπέσησε τὸν ὕπνον ἀπὸ τοῦ βασιλέως τὴν νύκτα
2 ἐκείνην. καὶ εἶπε τῷ διακόνῳ αὐτοῦ εἰσφέρειν γράμματα μνημό-
   συνα τῶν ἡμερῶν ἀναγιγνώσκειν αὐτῷ· εὗρε δὲ τὰ γράμματα τὰ
   γραφέντα περὶ Μαρδοχαίου, ὡς ἀπήγγειλε τῷ βασιλεῖ περὶ τῶν
   δύο εὐνούχων τοῦ βασιλέως ἐν τῷ φυλάσσειν αὐτοὺς, καὶ ζητῆσαι
3 ἐν τῷ ἐπιβαλεῖν αὐτοὺς τὰς χεῖρας Ἀρταξέρξη. Εἶπε δὲ ὁ βασι-
   λεύς· τίνα δόξαν ἢ χάριν ἐποιήσαμεν τῷ Μαρδοχαίῳ; καὶ εἶπον
   τὰ παιδάρια τῷ βασιλεῖ οἱ ἐκ τῆς διακονίας· οὐκ ἐποίησας αὐτῷ

### Chapter 5

3 And the king said unto her, "What wilt thou, Esther? And what is thy request? [Even] to the half of my kingdom, and it shall be given thee."

4 Then said Esther, "This day is for me a solemn day. If it therefore seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come unto the banquet which I shall prepare this day."

5 And the king said, "Hasten Haman, to perform the word of Esther." So the king and Haman came both unto the banquet which Esther had spoken [of].

6 And the king said unto Esther at the drinking of the wine, "What is it, Queen Esther? And whatsoever thou dost desire, it shall be granted thee."

7 Then said Esther, "My petition and my request [is this]:
8 If I have found favor in the sight of the king, let the king and Haman come tomorrow unto the banquet which I shall prepare for them; for tomorrow also will I do the same [things]."

9 Then Haman went forth from the king exceeding joyful and delighted;
10 but when he saw Mordecai the Jew in the court, Haman was filled with exceeding wrath.

11 And he came into his own house, and called for his friends, and Zosara his wife; and he showed them his riches, and the glory wherewith the king had invested him,
12 and how he had made him first in the governance of the kingdom. And Haman said, "Queen Esther hath called no man save me unto the banquet with the king, and for tomorrow also am I called.
13 Yet all this pleaseth me not, whensoever I see Mordecai the Jew in the court."

14 Then said Zosara his wife and all his friends unto him, "Let a gallows be made for thee of fifty cubits high, and in the morning speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon; then go thou in with the king unto the banquet, and make merry." And the saying pleased Haman, and the gallows was prepared.

### Chapter 6

1 But the Lord took away sleep from the king that night.
2 And he bade his servant to bring in the records of the daily chronicles to read unto him. And he found the writings that were written concerning Mordecai, how he had reported unto the king concerning the two eunuchs of the king while they guarded [him], and how they sought to lay hands on Artaxerxes.
3 Then said the king, "What honor or favor have we done to Mordecai?" And the young men from his service answered the king, "Thou hast done nothing for him."
