1 ΑΚΟΥΕ ('Ἰὼβ) ἀκοὴν ἐν ὀργῇ θυμοῦ Κυρίου, καὶ μελέτη ἐκ
2 στόματος αὐτοῦ ἐξελεύσεται. Ὑποκάτω παντὸς τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ἡ
3 ἀρχὴ αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὸ φῶς αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ πτερύγων γῆς. Ὀπίσω αὐ-
τοῦ βοήσεται φωνή, βροντήσει ἐν φωνῇ ὕβρεως αὐτοῦ· καὶ οὐκ
4 ἀνταλλάξει αὐτούς, ὅτι ἀκούσει φωνὴν αὐτοῦ. Βροντήσει δ᾽ ἰσχυ-
ρὸς ἐν φωνῇ αὐτοῦ θαυμασίᾳ· ἐποίησε γὰρ μεγάλα, ἃ οὐκ ᾔδειμεν.
5 Συντάσσων χιόνι, ἐπὶ γῆς γίνου· καὶ χειμὼν ὑετοῦ, καὶ χειμὼν
6 ὑετῶν δυναστείας αὐτοῦ. Ἐν χειρὶ παντὸς ἀνθρώπου κατασφρα-
γίζει, ἵνα γνῷ πᾶς ἄνθρωπος τὴν ἑαυτοῦ ἀσθένειαν. Εἰσῆλθε δὲ
7 θηρία ὑπὸ σκέπης, καὶ ἡσύχασεν ἐπὶ κοίταις. Ἐκ ταμείων ἐξέρ-
8 χονται αἱ δῖναι· ἀπὸ δὲ ἀκρωτηρίων ψῦχος. Καὶ ἀπὸ πνοῆς ἰσχυ-
9 ροῦ δώσει πάγος· διαχίζει δὲ ὕδωρ, ὡς ἐὰν βούληται. Καὶ ἐκλε-
10 κτὸν καταπλήσει νεφέλη· διασκορπίσει νέφος φῶς αὐτοῦ. Καὶ αὐ-
11 τὸν κυκλώματα διαστρέφει. Ἐν Θεεβουλαβὼθ εἰς ἔργα αὐτῶν
πάντα ὅσα ἂν ἐντείλῃ αὐτοῖς, ταῦτα συντέτακται παρ᾽ αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ
12 τῆς γῆς· ἐάν τε εἰς παιδείαν, ἐάν τε εἰς τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ, ἐάν τε
13 εἰς ἔλεος (αὐτοῦ), εὑρήσει αὐτόν. Ἐνωτίζου Ἰὼβ ταῦτα· στῆθι
14 καὶ νουθετοῦ δύναμιν Κυρίου. Οἶδας ὡς ἔθετο ὁ Θεὸς ἔργα αὐ-
15 τοῦ, ποιήσας φῶς ἐκ σκότους; Ἐπίστασαι δὲ διάκρισιν νεφῶν,
16 ἐξαίσια δὲ πτώματα πονηρῶν; Σοῦ δὲ ἡ στολὴ θερμή, ἡσυχάζε-
17 ται δὲ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς ἀπὸ νότου. Στερεώσεις μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ εἰς πα-
18 λαιώματα, ἰσχυρὰ ὡς ὅρασις ἐπιχὐσεως; Διότι διδάξον με, τί
19 ἐροῦμεν αὐτῷ· καὶ παυσώμεθα πολλὰ λέγοντες. Μὴ βίβλος ἢ
20 γραμματεὺς μοι παρέστηκεν, ἵνα ἄνθρωπον ἑστὼς κατασιωπήσω;
21 Πᾶσι γὰρ οὐχ ὁρατὸν φῶς· τηλαυγὲς ἔστιν ἐν τοῖς παλαιώμασιν,
ὥσπερ τὸ παρ᾽ αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ νεφῶν ἐξῆλθεν. Ἀπὸ βορρᾶ νέφη χρυ-
22 σαυγοῦντα· ἐπὶ τούτοις μεγάλη ἡ δόξα καὶ τιμὴ τοῦ παντοκρά-
τορος, καὶ οὐχ εὑρίσκομεν ἄλλον ὅμοιον (αὐτῷ καὶ) τῇ ἰσχύϊ αὐ-
23 τοῦ. Ὁ τὰ δίκαια κρίνων, οἴει ὅτι οὐκ εἰσακούει αὐτός; διὸ φο-
βηθήσονται αὐτὸν ἄνθρωποι· φοβηθήσονται δὲ αὐτὸν καὶ οἱ σο-
φοὶ τῇ καρδίᾳ.

## CHAPTER XXXVII.

**34** ...unrighteousness. And concerning this, my heart was troubled, and was moved from its place.

**1** Hear thou, O Job, the tidings of the Lord's fervent wrath; and from His mouth shall a pronouncement proceed.
**2** Beneath the whole heaven is His dominion, and His light [shineth] upon the wings of the earth.
**3** After Him shall a voice cry out; He shall thunder with the sound of His mighty grandeur;
**4** and He shall not alter these [thunders], for He shall hearken unto His [own] voice. Moreover, the Mighty One shall thunder with His voice marvelous; for He hath performed great things, which we did not know.
**5** He commandeth the snow, saying, "Be thou upon the earth!"; and the rain in winter, and the winter of the rains of His dominion.
**6** In the hand of every man He sealeth [their works], so that every man may come to know his own weakness.
**7** And the wild beasts have entered into their shelters, and have rested upon their lairs.
**8** From out of the chambers do the whirlwinds issue forth, and from the extremities [of the earth cometh] the bitter cold.
**9** And from the breath of the Mighty One shall frost be given; and He cleaveth the water, even as He willeth.
**10** And a cloud shall strike down the chosen [hail]; a cloud shall scatter His light.
**11** And circuits turn it about. By His counsels, for their works, all things whatsoever He may command them, these are arranged by Him upon the earth:
**12** whether it be for instruction, or for His land, or for [His] mercy, He shall bring it forth.
**13** Give ear, O Job, to these things; stand thou [still] and consider the power of the Lord.
**14** Knowest thou how God hath set forth His works, creating light out of darkness?
**15** And knowest thou the discernment of the clouds, and the prodigious downfallings of the wicked?
**16** Yet thy garment is warm; and the earth is made tranquil by the south wind.
**17** Wilt thou, with Him, make firm the ancient [heavens], [which are] mighty as a vision of an outpouring?
**18** Wherefore, instruct me, what we shall say unto Him; and let us cease from speaking many words.
**19** Hath a book or a scribe stood by me, that I, standing, should silence a man?
**20** For unto all is not the light visible; it is resplendent in the ancient firmament, even as that [light] from Him issued forth upon the clouds.
**21** From the north [come] clouds radiant as gold; in these is the great glory and honor of the Almighty,
**22** and we find none other like unto Him, and in His strength.
**23** He that judgeth righteous things—dost thou imagine that He Himself doth not hearken? Wherefore men shall fear Him; yea, and the wise in heart shall fear Him.
