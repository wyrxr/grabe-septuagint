πορευθῇ εἰς Γὲθ πρὸς Ἄγγις τοῦ ἐκζητῆσαι τοὺς δούλους αὐ-
τοῦ. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη Σεμεεί, καὶ ἤγαγε τοὺς δούλους αὐτοῦ ἐκ
Γέθ. Καὶ ἀπηγγέλῃ τῷ Σαλωμὼν, λέγοντες· ὅτι ἐπορεύθη Σε- 41
μεεὶ ἐξ Ἱερουσαλὴμ εἰς Γέθ, καὶ ἐπέστρεψε τοὺς δούλους αὐτοῦ.
Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ὁ βασιλεύς, καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸν Σεμεεί, καὶ εἶπε 42
πρὸς αὐτόν· οὐχὶ ὤρκισά σε κατὰ τοῦ Κυρίου, καὶ ἐπεμαρτυρά-
μην σοι, λέγων· ἐν ᾗ ἂν ἡμέρᾳ ἐξέλθῃς ἐξ Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ πο-
ρευθῇς εἰς δεξιὰ ἢ εἰς ἀριστερά, γινώσκων γνῶσιν ὅτι θανάτῳ ἀ-
ποθανῇ; Καὶ εἰπάς μοι· ἀγαθὸν τὸ ῥῆμα ὃ ἤκουσας. Καὶ τί οὐκ 43
ἐφύλαξας τὸν ὅρκον τοῦ Κυρίου, καὶ ἐντολὴν ἣν ἐνετειλά-
μην κατὰ σοῦ; Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς πρὸς Σεμεεί· σὺ ἔγνως 44
πᾶσαν τὴν κακίαν σου ἣν ἔγνω ἡ καρδία σου, ἃ ἐποίησας τῷ Δαυὶδ
τῷ πατρί μου· καὶ ἀνταπέδωκε Κύριος τὴν κακίαν σου εἰς κεφα-
λήν σου. Καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς Σαλωμὼν εὐλογημένος, καὶ ὁ θρόνος 45
Δαυὶδ ἔσται ἕτοιμος ἐνώπιον Κυρίου εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα. Καὶ ἐνε- 46
τείλατο ὁ βασιλεὺς Σαλωμὼν τῷ Βαναίᾳ υἱῷ Ἰωιάδαε· καὶ ἐξῆλ-
θε, καὶ ἀνεῖλεν αὐτόν, καὶ ἀπέθανε.

ΚΕΦ. Γ΄. III.

ΤΗΣ δὲ βασιλείας ἑδρασθείσης ἐν χειρὶ Σαλωμὼν, ἐπιγαμίαν 1
ἐποιήσατο Σαλωμὼν πρὸς Φαραὼ βασιλέα Αἰγύπτου· καὶ ἔλαβε
τὴν θυγατέρα Φαραώ, καὶ εἰσήγαγεν αὐτὴν εἰς τὴν πόλιν Δαυίδ,
ἕως οὗ συνετέλεσεν οἰκοδομῶν τὸν οἶκον ἑαυτοῦ, καὶ τὸν οἶκον
Κυρίου, καὶ τὸ τεῖχος Ἱερουσαλὴμ κύκλῳ. Πλὴν ὁ λαὸς ἦσαν 2
θυμιῶντες ἐν τοῖς ὑψηλοῖς, ὅτι οὐκ ᾠκοδομήθη οἶκος τῷ ὀνόματι
Κυρίου ἕως τῶν ἡμερῶν ἐκείνων. Καὶ ἠγάπησε Σαλωμὼν τὸν 3
Κύριον πορεύεσθαι ἐν τοῖς προστάγμασι Δαυὶδ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ,
πλὴν ἐν τοῖς ὑψηλοῖς αὐτὸς ἔθυε καὶ ἐθυμία. Καὶ ἀνέστη καὶ 4
ἐπορεύθη ὁ βασιλεὺς εἰς Γαβαών θῦσαι ἐκεῖ, ὅτι αὕτη ὑψηλοτάτη,
καὶ μεγάλη· χίλιαν ὁλοκαύτωσιν ἀνήνεγκε Σαλωμὼν ἐπὶ τὸ θυσια-
στήριον ἐκεῖνο ἐν Γαβαών. Καὶ ὤφθη τῷ Σαλωμὼν ὁ Κύριος 5
ἐν ὕπνῳ τὴν νύκτα. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Σαλωμὼν· αἴτησαί τι
αἴτημα σεαυτῷ. Καὶ εἶπε Σαλωμὼν· σὺ ἐποίησας μετὰ δούλου 6
σου Δαυὶδ τοῦ πατρός μου ἔλεος μέγα, καθώς διῆλθεν ἐνώπιον
σου ἐν ἀληθείᾳ, καὶ ἐν δικαιοσύνῃ, καὶ ἐν εὐθύτητι καρδίας μετὰ

### A Royal Translation of the Third Book of Kingdoms, Chapter 2

**40** ...and went unto Gath unto Achish to seek his servants. And Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.

**41** And it was reported unto Solomon, saying, "That Shimei went forth from Jerusalem unto Gath, and hath returned with his servants."

**42** Then the king sent and called Shimei, and said unto him, "Did I not make thee swear by the LORD, and did I not testify unto thee, saying: 'On whatsoever day thou shalt go forth from Jerusalem, and shalt go to the right hand or to the left, thou shalt surely know with knowledge that thou shalt die by death?' And didst thou say unto me: 'Good is the word which thou hast heard?'"

**43** "And why didst thou not keep the oath of the LORD, and the commandment which I laid upon thee?"

**44** And the king said unto Shimei, "Thou hast known all the wickedness of thine heart, which thou didst unto David my father; and the LORD hath repaid thy wickedness upon thine own head.

**45** But King Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD forever."

**46** And King Solomon commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he went forth, and slew him, and he died.

### Chapter 3

**1** Now the kingdom being established in the hand of Solomon, he made a marriage alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt. And he took the daughter of Pharaoh, and brought her into the City of David, until he had completed building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.

**2** Nevertheless, the people were offering incense in the high places, because there was no house built unto the Name of the LORD until those days.

**3** And Solomon loved the LORD, to walk in the statutes of David his father; save that he himself sacrificed and burned incense in the high places.

**4** And the king arose and went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for this was a very high and great [place]; a thousand burnt offering did Solomon offer upon that altar in Gibeon.

**5** And the LORD appeared unto Solomon in a dream by night. And the LORD said unto Solomon, "Ask for thyself whatsoever thou wilt ask."

**6** And Solomon said, "Thou hast shown unto Thy servant David my father great mercy, as he did walk before Thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with..."
