⁴ σαλὴμ. Καὶ ἔδοξαν λόγον διελθεῖν κήρυγμα ἐν παντὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἀπὸ Βηρσαβεὲ ἕως Δὰν, ἐλθόντας ποιῆσαι τὸ Φασὲκ Κυρίῳ Θεῷ Ἰσραὴλ ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, ὅτι πλῆθος οὐκ ἐποίησε κατὰ τὴν ⁵ γραφήν. ⁶ Καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν οἱ τρέχοντες σὺν ταῖς ἐπιστολαῖς παρὰ τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ τῶν ἀρχόντων εἰς πάντα Ἰσραὴλ καὶ Ἰούδαν κατὰ τὸ πρόσαγμα τοῦ βασιλέως, λέγοντες· υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐπιστρέψατε πρὸς Κύριον Θεὸν Ἀβραὰμ καὶ Ἰσαὰκ καὶ Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ ἐπιστρέφει τοὺς ἀνασεσωσμένους, τοὺς καταλειφθέντας ἀπὸ χειρὸς ⁷ βασιλέως Ἀσσούρ. ⁸ Καὶ μὴ γίνεσθε καθὼς οἱ πατέρες ὑμῶν, καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ ὑμῶν, οἳ ἀπέστησαν ἀπὸ Κυρίου Θεοῦ πατέρων ἑαυτῶν, καὶ παρέδωκεν αὐτοὺς εἰς ἐρήμωσιν καθὼς ὑμεῖς ὁρᾶτε. ⁹ Καὶ νῦν μὴ σκληρύνητε τοὺς τραχήλους ὑμῶν, ὡς οἱ πατέρες ὑμῶν, δότε δόξαν Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ, καὶ εἰσέλθατε εἰς τὸ ἁγίασμα αὐτοῦ ὃ ἡγίασεν εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, καὶ δουλεύσατε τῷ Κυρίῳ Θεῷ ὑμῶν, καὶ ἀποστρέψει ἀφ᾿ ὑμῶν θυμὸν ὀργῆς. ¹⁰ Ὅτι ἐν τῷ ἐπιστρέφειν ὑμᾶς πρὸς Κύριον, οἱ ἀδελφοὶ ὑμῶν καὶ τὰ τέκνα ὑμῶν ἔσονται ἐν οἰκτιρμοῖς ἔναντι πάντων αἰχμαλωτισάντων αὐτοὺς, καὶ ἐπιστρέψει εἰς τὴν γῆν ταύτην, ὅτι ἐλεήμων καὶ οἰκτίρμων Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν, καὶ οὐκ ἀποστρέψει τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἀφ᾿ ὑμῶν, ἐὰν ἐπιστρέψωμεν πρὸς αὐτόν. ¹¹ Καὶ οἱ τρέχοντες ἦσαν διαπορευόμενοι πόλιν ἐκ πόλεως ἐν τῷ ὄρει Ἐφραΐμ, καὶ Μανασσῆ, καὶ ἕως Ζαβουλών. Καὶ ἐγένοντο ὡς καταγελῶντες αὐτῶν, καὶ καταμωκώμενοι. ¹² Ἀλλὰ ἄνθρωποι Ἀσὴρ, καὶ ἀπὸ Μανασσῆ, καὶ ἀπὸ Ζαβουλὼν ἐνετράπησαν, καὶ ἦλθον εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ καὶ εἰς Ἰούδα. ¹³ Καὶ ἐγένετο χεὶρ Κυρίου δοῦναι αὐτοῖς καρδίαν μίαν ἐλθεῖν, τοῦ ποιῆσαι κατὰ τὸ πρόσταγμα τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ τῶν ἀρχόντων ἐν λόγῳ Κυρίου. ¹⁴ Καὶ συνήχθησαν εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ πολὺς λαὸς τοῦ ποιῆσαι τὴν ἑορτὴν τῶν ἀζύμων ἐν τῷ μηνὶ τῷ δευτέρῳ, ἐκκλησία πολλὴ σφόδρα. ¹⁵ Καὶ ἀνέστησαν, καὶ καθεῖλαν τὰ θυσιαστήρια τὰ ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ, καὶ πάντα ἐν οἷς ἐθυμίων τοῖς ψευδέσι, κατέσπασαν καὶ ἔρριψαν εἰς τὸν χειμάρρουν Κέδρων. ¹⁶ Καὶ ἔθυσαν τὸ Φασὲκ τῇ τεσσαρεσκαιδεκάτῃ τοῦ μηνὸς τοῦ δευτέρου. Καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς καὶ οἱ Λευῖται ἐνετράπησαν καὶ ἡγνίσθησαν, καὶ εἰσήνεγκαν ὁλοκαυτώματα εἰς οἶκον Κυρίου. Καὶ ἔστησαν ἐπὶ τὴν στάσιν ἑαυτῶν, κατὰ τὸ κρίμα ἑαυτῶν, κατὰ τὴν ἐντολὴν Μωυσῆ ἀνθρώπου τοῦ Θεοῦ,

### Chapter 30

⁴ Salem. And they resolved to send a proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba even unto Dan, that they should come to keep the Passover unto the Lord God of Israel in Jerusalem; ⁵ for a multitude had not kept it according to the Scripture.

⁶ So the runners went forth with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, according to the commandment of the king, saying, "Ye sons of Israel, turn ye again unto the Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, ⁷ that He may return unto those who are saved, which are left from the hand of the king of Assyria.

⁸ And be ye not as your fathers, and as your brethren, who trespassed against the Lord God of their fathers, and He gave them up to desolation, even as ye yourselves do see. ⁹ And now, harden not your necks, as did your fathers; but give glory unto the Lord your God, and enter ye into His sanctuary, which He hath sanctified forever. And serve the Lord your God, that He may turn away from you the fierceness of His wrath.

¹⁰ For if ye turn again unto the Lord, your brethren and your children shall find mercy before all them that have carried them away captive, and He shall return to this land; for the Lord your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away His face from you, if we turn unto Him."

¹¹ So the runners went from city to city through the mount of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and even unto Zebulun. But they became as those who mocked them, and scorned them. ¹² Nevertheless, certain men of Asher, and of Manasseh, and of Zebulun, humbled themselves, and came unto Jerusalem and unto Judah.

¹³ Moreover, the hand of the Lord was upon them, to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by the word of the Lord. ¹⁴ And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation.

¹⁵ And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars whereon they offered incense unto false gods, they pulled down and cast into the brook Kidron. ¹⁶ Then they slaughtered the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month; and the priests and the Levites, being humbled, sanctified themselves, and brought in burnt offerings unto the house of the Lord. And they stood at their posts, according to their ordinance, according to the commandment of Moses, the man of God.
