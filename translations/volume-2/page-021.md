πάντα τὰ ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ σου ἀπαγγελῶ σοι. Καὶ περὶ τῶν ὄνων 20
τῶν ἀπολωλυιῶν σοι σήμερον τριταίων, μὴ θῇς τὴν καρδίαν σου
αὐταῖς, ὅτι εὕρηνται. καὶ τίνι τὰ ὡραῖα τοῦ Ἰσραήλ; οὐ σοί, καὶ
παντὶ τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ πατρός σου; Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Σαούλ, καὶ εἶπεν· 21
οὐχὶ ἀνδρὸς υἱὸς Ἰεμιναίου ἐγώ εἰμι, τοῦ μικροτέρου σκήπτρου φυ-
λῆς Ἰσραήλ; καὶ τῆς φυλῆς τῆς ἐλαχίστης ἐξ ὅλου σκήπτρου Βε-
νιαμείν; καὶ ἵνατί ἐλάλησας πρὸς με κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο; Καὶ 22
ἔλαβε Σαμουὴλ τὸν Σαοὺλ καὶ τὸ παιδάριον αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἰσήγαγεν
αὐτοὺς εἰς τὸ κατάλυμα, καὶ ἔθετο αὐτοῖς τόπον ἐν πρώτοις τῶν
κεκλημένων, ὡσεὶ ἑβδομήκοντα ἀνδρῶν. Καὶ εἶπε Σαμουὴλ τῷ 23
μαγείρῳ· δός μοι τὴν μερίδα ἣν ἔδωκά σοι, ἣν εἶπά σοι θεῖναι
αὐτὴν παρὰ σοί. Καὶ ὕψωσεν ὁ μάγειρος τὴν κωλέαν καὶ τὸ ἐπ᾽ 24
αὐτῇ, καὶ παρέθηκεν αὐτὴν ἐνώπιον Σαούλ. Καὶ εἶπε Σαμουὴλ
τῷ Σαούλ· Ἰδοὺ ὑπόλειμμα, παράθες αὐτὸ ἐνώπιόν σου καὶ φάγε,
ὅτι εἰς μαρτυρίαν τέθειταί σοι παρὰ τοῦ λαοῦ, ἀπόκνιζε. Καὶ ἔ-
φαγε Σαοὺλ μετὰ Σαμουὴλ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ. Καὶ κατέβη ἐκ 25
τῆς Βαμᾶ εἰς τὴν πόλιν. καὶ διέστρωσαν τῷ Σαούλ ἐπὶ τῷ δώ- 26
ματι, καὶ ἐκοιμήθη. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἀνέβαινεν ὁ ὄρθρος, καὶ ἐκάλεσε
Σαμουὴλ τὸν Σαοὺλ ἐπὶ τῷ δώματι, λέγων· ἀνάστα, καὶ ἐξαποστελῶ
σε. Καὶ ἀνέστη Σαούλ, καὶ ἐξῆλθε Σαοὺλ αὐτὸς καὶ Σαμουὴλ ἕως
ἔξω. Αὐτῶν καταβαινόντων εἰς μέρος τῆς πόλεως, καὶ Σαμουὴλ
εἶπε τῷ Σαούλ· εἶπον τῷ νεανίσκῳ, καὶ διελθέτω ἔμπροσθεν ἡμῶν.
(καὶ διῆλθεν) καὶ σὺ στῆθι ὡς σήμερον, καὶ ἀκουστὸν σοι ῥῆμα Θεοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. Ι΄. Χ.

ΚΑΙ ἔλαβε Σαμουὴλ τὸν φιακὸν τοῦ ἐλαίου, καὶ ἐπέχεεν ἐπὶ 1
τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐφίλησεν αὐτόν, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· οὐχὶ κέ-
χρικέ σε Κύριος εἰς ἄρχοντα ἐπὶ τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ; καὶ
σὺ ἄρξεις ἐν λαῷ Κυρίου, καὶ σώσεις αὐτὸν ἐκ χειρὸς ἐχθρῶν αὐ-
τοῦ κυκλόθεν. Καὶ τοῦτό σοι τὸ σημεῖον, ὅτι κέχρικέ σε Κύριος 2
ἐπὶ κληρονομίαν αὐτοῦ εἰς ἄρχοντα· ὡς ἂν ἀπέλθῃς σήμερον ἀπ᾿
ἐμοῦ, καὶ εὑρήσεις δύο ἄνδρας πρὸς τοῖς τάφοις Ῥαχὴλ ἐν τῷ
ὁρίῳ τοῦ Βενιαμεῖν ἀλλομένους μεγάλα, καὶ ἐροῦσί σοι· εὕρηνται
αἱ ὄνοι ἃς ἐπορεύθητε ζητεῖν· καὶ ἰδοὺ ἀποτέτινακται ὁ πατὴρ
σου τὸ ῥῆμα τῶν ὄνων, καὶ ἐδαψιλεύσατο δι᾽ ὑμᾶς, λέγων· τί ποι-

**Chapter 9**

20
all that is in thine heart I will declare unto thee. And as for the asses that have been lost unto thee now these three days, set not thy heart upon them, for they are found. And to whom belong all the desirable things of Israel? Is it not unto thee, and to all the house of thy father?"
21
Then Saul answered and said, "Am I not a Benjamite, a son of a man, of the smallest scepter of the tribe of Israel? Yea, and of the least tribe from all the scepter of Benjamin? And why hast thou spoken unto me after this manner?"
22
Then Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the guest-chamber, and gave them a place among the chief of those that were invited, about seventy men.
23
And Samuel said unto the cook, "Give me the portion which I gave thee, which I told thee to set aside with thee."
24
And the cook lifted up the leg and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said unto Saul, "Behold, the reserved portion; set it before thee and eat, for it hath been set aside for thee as a testimony from the people; now take of it." And Saul did eat with Samuel on that day.
25
And they went down from the High Place into the city.
26
And they spread a bed for Saul upon the housetop, and he slept. And it came to pass, as the morning arose, that Samuel called Saul upon the housetop, saying, "Arise, and I will send thee away." And Saul arose, and Saul himself went out, and Samuel, until they were outside.
27
As they were going down to a part of the city, Samuel said unto Saul, "Tell the young man, that he pass on before us" (and he passed on), "and do thou stand still now, and the word of God shall be made known unto thee."

**Chapter 10**

1
Then Samuel took the flask of oil, and poured it upon his head; and he kissed him, and said unto him, "Hath not the Lord anointed thee to be a ruler over His people, even over Israel? And thou shalt rule over the people of the Lord, and shalt save them from the hand of their enemies round about.
2
And this shall be a sign unto thee, that the Lord hath anointed thee to be ruler over His inheritance: As soon as thou art departed from me this day, then shalt thou find two men by Rachel's tombs in the border of Benjamin, leaping greatly; and they shall say unto thee, 'The asses are found which ye went to seek'; and behold, thy father hath cast off the matter of the asses, and hath become greatly distraught concerning you, saying, 'What shall I do for my son?'"
