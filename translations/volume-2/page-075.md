βασιλέως τοῦ θανατῶσαι τὸν Ἀβεννὴρ υἱὸν Νήρ. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ 38
βασιλεὺς πρὸς τοὺς παῖδας αὐτοῦ· οὐκ οἴδατε, ὅτι ἡγούμενος μέ-
γας πέπτωκεν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ταύτῃ ἐν τῷ Ἰσραήλ; Καὶ ὅτι ἐγὼ 39
εἰμὶ σήμερον συγγενὴς καὶ καθεσταμένος ὑπὸ βασιλέως; οἱ δὲ ἄν-
δρες οὗτοι υἱοὶ Σαρουίας σκληρότεροί μου εἰσίν· ἀνταποδῷ Κύριος
τῷ ποιοῦντι πονηρὰ κατὰ τὴν κακίαν αὐτοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. Δ΄. IV.

ΚΑὶ ἤκουσεν Ἰσβοσθὲ υἱὸς Σαούλ, ὅτι τέθνηκεν Ἀβεννὴρ ἐν 1
Χεβρὼν, καὶ ἐξελύθησαν αἱ χεῖρες αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντες οἱ ἄνδρες
Ἰσραὴλ παρείθησαν. Καὶ δύο ἄνδρες ἡγούμενοι συστρεμμάτων τῷ 2
Ἰσβοσθὲ υἱῷ Σαούλ· ὄνομα τῷ ἑνί, Βαανὰ, καὶ ὄνομα τῷ δευτέ-
ρῳ, Ῥηχὰβ, υἱοὶ Ῥεμμὼν τοῦ Βηρωθαίου ἐκ τῶν υἱῶν Βενιαμείν·
ἔτι Βηρωθὸ ἐλογίζετο τοῖς υἱοῖς Βενιαμείν. Καὶ ἀπέδρασαν οἱ Βη- 3
ρωθαῖοι εἰς Γεθθεὶμ, καὶ ἦσαν ἐκεῖ παροικοῦντες ἕως τῆς ἡμέ-
ρας ταύτης. Καὶ τῷ Ἰωνάθαν υἱῷ Σαοὺλ υἱὸς πεπληγὼς τοὺς 4
πόδας, υἱὸς ἐτῶν πέντε, καὶ οὗτος ἐν τῷ ἐλθεῖν τὴν ἀγγελίαν Σα-
οὺλ καὶ Ἰωνάθαν τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ ἐξ Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ ἦρεν αὐτὸν ἡ
τιθηνὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔφυγε. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ σπεύδει αὐτὸν καὶ
ἀναχωρεῖν, καὶ ἔπεσε, καὶ ἐχωλάνθη, καὶ ὄνομα αὐτῷ Μεμφιβο-
σθέ. Καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ῥεμμὼν τοῦ Βηρωθαίου, Ῥηχὰβ 5
καὶ Βαανὰ, καὶ εἰσῆλθον ἐν τῷ καύματι τῆς ἡμέρας εἰς οἶκον
Ἰσβοσθὲ, καὶ αὐτὸς ἐκάθευδεν ἐν τῇ κοίτῃ τῆς μεσημβρίας. 6
Καὶ ἰδοὺ ἡ θυρωρὸς τοῦ οἴκου ἐκάθαιρε πυροὺς, καὶ ἐνύσταζε, καὶ
ἐκάθευδε, καὶ Ῥηχὰβ καὶ Βαανὰ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ διέλαβον, καὶ εἰσ- 7
ῆλθον εἰς τὸν οἶκον. Καὶ Ἰσβοσθὲ ἐκάθευδεν ἐπὶ τῆς κλίνης
αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ κοιτῶνι αὐτοῦ, καὶ τύπτουσιν αὐτὸν, καὶ θανατοῦσιν
αὐτὸν, καὶ ἀφαιροῦσι τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔλαβον τὴν κεφα-
λὴν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀπῆλθον ὁδὸν τὴν κατὰ δυσμὰς ὅλην τὴν νύκτα.
Καὶ ἤνεγκαν τὴν κεφαλὴν Ἰσβοσθὲ τῷ Δαυὶδ εἰς Χεβρὼν, καὶ 8
εἶπον πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα· Ἰδοὺ κεφαλὴ Ἰσβοσθὲ υἱοῦ Σαοὺλ τοῦ
ἐχθροῦ σου, ὃς ἐζήτει τὴν ψυχήν σου, καὶ ἔδωκε Κύριος τῷ κυ-
ρίῳ (μου) βασιλεῖ ἐκδίκησιν τῶν ἐχθρῶν αὐτοῦ, ὡς ἡ ἡμέρα αὕ- 9
τη, ἐκ Σαοὺλ τοῦ ἐχθροῦ σου, καὶ ἐκ τοῦ σπέρματος αὐτοῦ. Καὶ
ἀπεκρίθη Δαυὶδ τῷ Ῥηχὰβ καὶ τῷ Βαανᾷ ἀδελφῷ αὐτοῦ, υἱοῖς

**38** And the king said unto his servants, "Know ye not that a great prince hath fallen this day in Israel?
**39** And [as for] me, though I be this day [but] a kinsman and one appointed by the King; yet these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too hard for me. The Lord shall recompense him that doeth evil according to his wickedness."

### Chapter 4

**1** Now when Ishbosheth the son of Saul heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were weakened, and all the men of Israel were dismayed.
**2** And two men, captains of bands, belonged to Ishbosheth the son of Saul; the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (for Beeroth was reckoned to the children of Benjamin.
**3** And the Beerothites had fled to Gittaim, and were sojourning there until this day.)
**4** And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son who was lame in his feet; he was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan his son from Israel. And his nurse took him up and fled; and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee and to go away, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.
**5** And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, journeyed forth and came into the house of Ishbosheth in the heat of the day, as he lay on his bed at noon.
**6** And behold, the doorkeeper of the house was cleaning wheat, and she slumbered and slept; and Rechab and Baanah, the brothers, passed through, and entered into the house.
**7** And Ishbosheth was sleeping upon his bed in his bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and took off his head, and took his head, and went away by the way of the west all the night.
**8** And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron, and said unto the king, "Behold, the head of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul thine enemy, who sought thy life; and the Lord hath given unto my lord the King vengeance this day upon his enemies, [even] upon Saul thine enemy, and upon his seed."
