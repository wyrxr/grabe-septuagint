ΚΕΦ. ΙΗʹ. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Δʹ. 699
γους τούτους; οὐχὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς ἄνδρας τοὺς καθημένους ἐπὶ τοῦ τεί-
χους, τοῦ φαγεῖν τὴν κόπρον αὐτῶν, καὶ πιεῖν τὸ οὗρον αὐτῶν
μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν; Καὶ ἔστη Ῥαψάκης, καὶ ἐβόησε φωνῇ μεγάλῃ Ἰου- 28
δαϊστί, καὶ ἐλάλησε, καὶ εἶπεν· ἀκούσατε τοὺς λόγους τοῦ βασι-
λέως τοῦ μεγάλου, βασιλέως Ἀσσυρίων˙ Τάδε λέγει ὁ βασιλεὺς 29
μὴ ἐξαιρέτω ὑμᾶς Ἑζεκίας, ὅτι οὐ μὴ δύνηται ὑμᾶς ἐξελέσθαι ἐκ
χειρός μου˙ Καὶ μὴ ἀπελπιζέτω ὑμᾶς Ἑζεκίας πρὸς Κύριον, λέ- 30
γων· ἐξελούμενος ἐξελεῖται ἡμᾶς Κύριος, οὐ μὴ παραδοθῇ ἡ πόλις
αὕτη ἐν χειρὶ βασιλέως Ἀσσυρίων. Μὴ ἀκούετε Ἑζεκίου, ὅτι τάδε 31
λέγει ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων· ποιήσατε μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ εὐλογίαν, καὶ ἐ-
ξέλθατε πρὸς με, καὶ πίεται ἀνὴρ τὴν ἄμπελον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀνὴρ
τὴν συκῆν αὐτοῦ φάγεται, καὶ πίεται ὕδωρ τοῦ λάκκου αὐτοῦ,
ἕως ἔλθω, καὶ λάβω ὑμᾶς εἰς γῆν ὡς ἡ γῆ ὑμῶν, γῆ σίτου, καὶ οἴ- 32
νου, καὶ ἀμπελώνων, καὶ ἄρτου, γῆ ἐλαίας ἐλαίου, καὶ μέλιτος,
καὶ ζήσετε, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἀποθάνητε, καὶ μὴ ἀκούετε Ἑζεκίου, ὅτι
ἀπατᾷ ὑμᾶς λέγων, Κύριος ῥύσεται ὑμᾶς. Μὴ ῥυόμενοι ἐῤῥύσαν- 33
το οἱ θεοὶ τῶν ἐθνῶν ἕκαστος τὴν ἑαυτοῦ χώραν ἐκ χειρὸς βασι-
λέως Ἀσσυρίων; ποῦ ἐστιν ὁ Θεὸς Αἰμάθ, καὶ Ἀρφάδ; ποῦ ἐ- 34
στιν ὁ Θεὸς Σεφφαρουαΐμ, Ἀνά, καὶ Αὐά; μὴ ἐξεῖλαντο Σαμάρειαν
ἐκ χειρός μου; Τίς ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς θεοῖς τῶν γαιῶν, οἱ ἐξεῖλαντο 35
τὰς γαίας αὐτῶν ἐκ χειρός μου, ὅτι ἐξελεῖται Κύριος τὴν Ἱε-
ρουσαλὴμ ἐκ χειρός μου; Καὶ ἐκώφευσαν, καὶ οὐκ ἀπεκρίθησαν 36
αὐτῷ λόγον, ὅτι ἐντολὴ τοῦ βασιλέως, λέγων, οὐκ ἀποκριθήσεσθε
αὐτῷ. Καὶ εἰσῆλθεν Ἐλιακείμ, υἱὸς Χελκίου, ὁ οἰκονόμος, (ὁ 37
υἱὸς Χελκίου) καὶ Σομνὰς ὁ γραμματεὺς, καὶ Ἰωὰς υἱὸς Ἀσὰφ
ὁ ἀναμιμνήσκων, πρὸς τὸν Ἑζεκίαν, διεῤῥηχότες τὰ ἱμάτια, καὶ
ἀνήγγειλαν αὐτῷ τοὺς λόγους Ῥαψάκου.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΘʹ. ΧΙΧ.

ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο ὡς ἤκουσεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἑζεκίας, καὶ διέρρηξε 1
τὰ ἱμάτια ἑαυτοῦ, καὶ περιεβάλετο σάκκον, καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς οἶκον
Κυρίου. Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ἐλιακεὶμ τὸν οἰκονόμον, καὶ Σομνὰν 2
τὸν γραμματέα, καὶ τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους τῶν ἱερέων περιβεβλημέ-
νους σάκκους πρὸς Ἡσαΐαν τὸν προφήτην υἱὸν Ἀμὼς. καὶ εἶπον 3
πρὸς αὐτόν· τάδε λέγει Ἑζεκίας· ἡμέρα θλίψεως, καὶ ἐλεγμοῦ, καὶ

### Literary Translation:

### 2 Kings 18

**27** ...these words? Hath my master not sent me to the men which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own urine with you?"
**28** Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and spake, and said,
**29** "Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria! Thus saith the king: 'Let not Hezekiah deceive you, for he shall not be able to deliver you out of my hand;
**30** Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, "The LORD will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria."
**31** Hearken not unto Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, "Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me, and every man shall eat of his own vine, and every man shall eat of his own fig tree, and drink the waters of his own cistern;
**32** until I come and take you away to a land like unto your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of vineyards and bread, a land of olive oil and of honey, that ye may live and not die. And hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, 'The LORD will deliver us.'
**33** Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
**34** Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivah? Have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
**35** Who among all the gods of the countries hath delivered their country out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?"'
**36** But they held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, "Ye shall not answer him."
**37** Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, (even the son of Hilkiah,) and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.

### 2 Kings 19

**1** And it came to pass, when King Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.
**2** And he sent Eliakim, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.
**3** And they said unto him, "Thus saith Hezekiah, 'This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of"
