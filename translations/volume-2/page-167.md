Κυρίου πρὸς Ἠλιοὺ λέγων· ἀνάστηθι καὶ πορεύθητι εἰς Σαρεπτὰ 9
τῆς Σιδωνίας, καὶ καθήσῃ ἐκεῖ· ἰδοὺ ἐντέταλμαι ἐκεῖ γυναικὶ χή-
ρᾳ τοῦ διατρέφειν σε. Καὶ ἀνέστη, καὶ ἐπορεύθη εἰς Σαρεπτὰ, καὶ 10
ἦλθεν εἰς τὸν πυλῶνα τῆς πόλεως· καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐκεῖ γυνὴ χήρα συν-
έλεγε ξύλα· καὶ ἐβόησεν ὀπίσω αὐτῆς Ἠλιοὺ, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ· λά-
βε δὴ μοι ὀλίγον ὕδωρ εἰς ἄγγος, καὶ πίομαι. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη λα- 11
βεῖν, καὶ ἐβόησεν ὀπίσω αὐτῆς Ἠλιοὺ, καὶ εἶπεν· λήψῃ δὴ μοι ψω-
μὸν ἄρτου τοῦ ἐν τῇ χειρί σου. Καὶ εἶπεν ἡ γυνή· Ζῇ Κύριος ὁ 12
Θεός σου, εἰ ἔστι μοι ἐγκρυφίας, ἀλλ᾿ ἢ ὅσον δραξ ἀλεύρου ἐν τῇ
ὑδρίᾳ, καὶ ὀλίγον ἔλαιον ἐν τῷ καψάκῃ· καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ συλλέγω
δύο ξυλάρια, καὶ εἰσελεύσομαι, καὶ ποιήσω αὐτὸ ἐμαυτῇ, καὶ τοῖς
τέκνοις μου, καὶ φαγόμεθα αὐτὸ, καὶ ἀποθανούμεθα. Καὶ Ἠλιοὺ 13
εἶπε πρὸς αὐτήν· θάρσει, εἴσελθε, καὶ ποίησον κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμά σου·
ἀλλὰ ποιήσόν μοι ἐκεῖθεν ἐγκρυφίαν μικρὸν ἐν πρώτοις, καὶ ἐξοί-
σεις μοι· ἑαυτῇ δὲ καὶ τοῖς τέκνοις σου ποιήσεις ἐπ᾿ ἐσχάτῳ. Ὅτι 14
τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ· ἡ ὑδρία τοῦ ἀλεύρου οὐκ ἐκ-
λείψει, καὶ ὁ καψάκης τοῦ ἐλαίου οὐκ ἐλαττονήσει ἕως ἡμέρας τοῦ
δοῦναι Κύριον ὑετὸν ἐπὶ προσώπου τῆς γῆς. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἡ γυνή, 15
καὶ ἐποίησε κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα Ἠλιοὺ, καὶ ἤσθιεν αὐτὸς, καὶ αὐτὴ,
καὶ τὰ τέκνα αὐτῆς, (καὶ) ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης. Καὶ ἡ ὑδρία 16
τοῦ ἀλεύρου οὐκ ἐξέλιπε, καὶ ὁ καψάκης τοῦ ἐλαίου οὐκ ἠλαττο-
νήθη κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα Κυρίου ὃ ἐλάλησεν ἐν χειρὶ Ἠλιοῦ. Καὶ ἐγέ- 17
νετο μετὰ τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα, καὶ ἠῤῥώστησεν ὁ υἱὸς τῆς γυναικὸς
τῆς κυρίας τοῦ οἴκου· καὶ ἦν ἡ ἀῤῥωστία αὐτοῦ κραταιὰ σφόδρα,
ἕως οὗ οὐχ ὑπελείφθη ἐν αὐτῷ πνεῦμα. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς Ἠ- 18
λιοῦ· τί ἐμοί, καὶ σοὶ, ἄνθρωπε τοῦ Θεοῦ; εἰσῆλθες πρὸς
μέ τοῦ ἀναμνῆσαι τὰς ἀδικίας μου, καὶ θανατῶσαι τὸν υἱ-
όν μου; Καὶ εἶπεν Ἠλιοὺ πρὸς τὴν γυναῖκα· δός μοι τὸν υἱόν σου 19
καὶ ἔλαβεν αὐτὸν ἐκ τοῦ κόλπου αὐτῆς, καὶ ἀνήγαγεν αὐτὸν εἰς
τὸ ὑπερῶον ἐν ᾧ αὐτὸς ἐκάθητο ἐκεῖ, καὶ ἐκοίμισεν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τῆς
κλίνης αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἀνεβόησεν Ἠλιοὺ, καὶ εἶπεν· οἴ μοι Κύριε, ὁ 20
μάρτυς τῆς χήρας μεθ᾿ ἧς ἐγὼ κατοικῶ μετ᾿ αὐτῆς, σὺ κεκάκω-
κας τοῦ θανατῶσαι τὸν υἱὸν αὐτῆς. Καὶ ἐνεφύσησε τῷ παιδαρίῳ 21
τρὶς, καὶ ἐπεκαλέσατο τὸν Κύριον, καὶ εἶπε· Κύριε ὁ Θεός μου,
ἐπιστραφήτω δὴ ἡ ψυχὴ τοῦ παιδαρίου τούτου εἰς αὐτόν. Καὶ ἐγέ- 22
νετο οὕτως, καὶ ἀνεβόησε, καὶ ἤκουσε Κύριος ἐν φωνῇ Ἠλιοὺ· καὶ

### Kings III, Chapter 17

**8** And the word of the Lord came unto Elijah, saying,
**9** "Arise, and get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Sidon, and thou shalt dwell there; behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to nourish thee."
**10** And he arose, and went to Zarephath; and when he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow woman was there gathering sticks. And Elijah called after her, and said unto her, "Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink."
**11** And as she was going to fetch it, Elijah called after her, and said, "Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread which is in thine hand."
**12** And the woman said, "As the Lord thy God liveth, I have no baked cake, but only a handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse; and, behold, I am gathering two small sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and for my children, that we may eat it, and die."
**13** And Elijah said unto her, "Fear not; go and do as thou hast said; but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it forth unto me: and for thyself and for thy children shalt thou make [it] afterwards.
**14** For thus saith the Lord God of Israel, 'The barrel of meal shall not fail, neither shall the cruse of oil diminish, until the day that the Lord shall send rain upon the face of the earth.'"
**15** And she went and did according to the word of Elijah: and he, and she, and her children did eat, [and so did they continue to eat] from that day.
**16** And the barrel of meal failed not, neither did the cruse of oil diminish, according to the word of the Lord, which He spake by the hand of Elijah.
**17** And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was exceeding sore, until there was no breath left in him.
**18** And she said unto Elijah, "What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? Art thou come unto me to call my sins to remembrance, and to slay my son?"
**19** And Elijah said unto the woman, "Give me thy son." And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into the loft where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.
**20** And Elijah cried unto the Lord, and said, "Alas, O Lord, witness of this widow, with whom I dwell, yea, with her do I dwell, hast Thou brought this evil upon her, to cause her son to die?"
**21** And he breathed upon the child thrice, and called upon the Lord, and said, "O Lord my God, let now the soul of this child return unto him."
**22** And it came to pass thus, and he cried out, and the Lord heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child returned to his inward parts, and he lived.
