ΚΕΦ. Η'. VIII.
...κατὰ τὰς φυλακὰς αὐτῶν, τοῦ αἰνεῖν καὶ λειτουργεῖν κατέναντι τῶν ἱερέων κατὰ τὸν λόγον ἡμέρας ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ. Καὶ οἱ πυλωροὶ κατὰ τὰς διαιρέσεις αὐτῶν εἰς πύλην καὶ πύλην· ὅτι οὕτως ἐντολὴ Δαυὶδ ἀνθρώπου τοῦ Θεοῦ·
¹⁵ Οὐ παρῆλθον τὰς ἐντολὰς τοῦ βασιλέως περὶ τῶν ἱερέων καὶ τῶν Λευιτῶν εἰς πάντα λόγον, καὶ εἰς τοὺς θησαυρούς.
¹⁶ Καὶ ἡτοιμάσθη πᾶσα ἡ ἐργασία, ἀφ᾽ ἧς ἡμέρας ἐθεμελιώθη ἕως οὗ ἐτελείωσε Σαλωμὼν τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου.
¹⁷ Τότε ὤχετο Σαλωμὼν εἰς Γασιὼν Γαβέρ, καὶ εἰς τὴν Αἰλὰθ τὴν παραθαλασσίαν ἐν γῇ Ἰδουμαίᾳ.
¹⁸ Καὶ ἀπέστειλε Χειρὰμ ἐν χειρὶ παίδων αὑτοῦ πλοῖα, καὶ παῖδας εἰδότας θάλασσαν, καὶ ὤχοντο μετὰ τῶν παίδων Σαλωμὼν εἰς Σωφιρά, καὶ ἔλαβον ἐκεῖθεν τετρακόσια καὶ πεντήκοντα τάλαντα χρυσίου, καὶ ἦλθον πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Σαλωμών.

ΚΕΦ. Θ'. ΙΧ.
¹ ΚΑὶ βασίλισσα Σαβὰ ἤκουσε τὸ ὄνομα Σαλωμῶν, καὶ ἦλθε τοῦ πειράσαι Σαλωμὼν ἐν αἰνίγμασιν εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐν δυνάμει βαρεία σφόδρα· καὶ κάμηλοι αἴρουσαι ἀρώματα καὶ χρυσίον εἰς πλῆθος, καὶ λίθον τίμιον· καὶ ἦλθε πρὸς Σαλωμὼν, καὶ ἐλάλησε πρὸς αὐτὸν πάντα ὅσα ἦν ἐν τῇ ψυχῇ αὐτῆς.
² Καὶ ἀνήγγειλεν αὐτῇ Σαλωμὼν πάντας τοὺς λόγους αὐτῆς, καὶ οὐ παρῆλθε λόγος ἀπὸ Σαλωμὼν ὃν οὐκ ἀπήγγειλεν αὐτῇ.
³ Καὶ ἴδε βασίλισσα Σαβὰ τὴν σοφίαν Σαλωμὼν, καὶ τὸν οἶκον ὃν ᾠκοδόμησε,
⁴ καὶ τὰ βρώματα τῶν τραπεζῶν, καὶ καθεδρὰν παίδων αὐτοῦ, καὶ στάσιν λειτουργῶν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἱματισμὸν αὐτῶν, καὶ οἰνοχόους αὐτοῦ, καὶ στολισμὸν αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰ ὁλοκαυτώματα ἃ ἀνέφερεν ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου, καὶ ἐξ ἑαυτῆς ἐγένετο·
⁵ καὶ εἶπε πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα· ἀληθινὸς ὁ λόγος ὃν ἤκουσα ἐν τῇ γῇ μου περὶ τῶν λόγων σου, καὶ περὶ τῆς σοφίας σου·
⁶ καὶ οὐκ ἐπίστευσα τοῖς λόγοις ἕως οὗ ἦλθον, καὶ εἶδον οἱ ὀφθαλμοί μου, καὶ ἰδοὺ οὐκ ἀπηγγέλη μοι ἥμισυ τοῦ πλήθους τῆς σοφίας σου, καὶ προσέθηκας ἐπὶ τὴν ἀκοὴν ἣν ἤκουσα·
⁷ μακάριοι οἱ ἄνδρες σου, μακάριοι οἱ παῖδες σου, οὗτοι οἱ παρεστηκότες σοι διαπαντὸς καὶ ἀκούοντες τὴν σοφίαν σου.
⁸ Ἔστω Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου ηὐλογημένος, ὃς ἠθέλησεν ἐν σοὶ, τοῦ δοῦναί σε ἐπὶ θρόνου αὐτοῦ εἰς βασιλέα Κυρίῳ Θεῷ σου· ἐν τῷ ἀγαπῆσαι Κύριον τὸν Θεόν σου τὸν Ἰσραὴλ τοῦ στῆσαι αὐτὸν εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, καὶ ἔδωκε

CHAPTER 8.

...their watches, to praise and to minister before the priests, according to the duty of each day. And the doorkeepers according to their divisions, [for] each gate; for thus was the commandment of David, the man of God.
¹⁵ They did not transgress the commandments of the king concerning the priests and the Levites in any matter, nor concerning the treasuries.
¹⁶ And all the work was made ready, from the day that it was founded until Solomon had finished the house of the LORD.
¹⁷ Then went Solomon to Gasion Gaber, and to Ailath, which is by the sea, in the land of Idumaea.
¹⁸ And Hiram sent by the hand of his servants ships, and servants who had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the servants of Solomon unto Sophira, and took from thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and came unto King Solomon.

CHAPTER 9.

¹ And when the Queen of Sheba heard of the name of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with riddles to Jerusalem, with a retinue exceeding mighty; and camels bearing spices and gold in great abundance, and precious stone. And she came unto Solomon, and she spoke with him all that was in her heart.
² And Solomon declared unto her all her words, and there was no word from Solomon which he declared not unto her.
³ And when the Queen of Sheba saw the wisdom of Solomon, and the house which he had built,
⁴ and the food of his tables, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and their attire; and the burnt offerings which he offered in the house of the LORD, and she was [as one] beside herself.
⁵ And she said unto the king, "True is the report which I heard in mine own land concerning thy sayings, and concerning thy wisdom.
⁶ And I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen; and behold, the half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told unto me; for thou hast added unto the fame which I heard.
⁷ Blessed are thy men, and blessed are thy servants! These who stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.
⁸ Blessed be the LORD thy God, who hath delighted in thee, to set thee upon His throne as king for the LORD thy God: because the LORD thy God loved Israel, to establish him for ever; and he hath made..."
