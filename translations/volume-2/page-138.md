ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Γ΄. ΚΕΦ. Ζ΄.
**14** υἱὸν γυναικὸς χήρας, καὶ οὗτος ἀπὸ τῆς φυλῆς Νεφθαλείμ· καὶ
ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ ἀνὴρ τίμιος, τέκτων χαλκοῦ, καὶ πεπληρωμένος
τῆς τέχνης, καὶ συνέσεως, καὶ ἐπιγνώσεως τοῦ ποιεῖν πᾶν ἔργον
ἐν χαλκῷ· καὶ εἰσήχθη πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Σαλωμὼν καὶ ἐποίησε
**15** πάντα τὰ ἔργα. Καὶ ἐχώνευσε τοὺς δύο στύλους τῷ αἰλὰμ
τοῦ οἴκου, ὀκτωκαίδεκα πήχεις ὕψος τοῦ στύλου, καὶ περίμετρον
τεσσαρεσκαίδεκα πήχεις ἐκύκλουν αὐτὸν τὸ πάγος τοῦ στύλου τεσ-
σάρων δακτύλων τὰ κοιλώματα· καὶ οὕτως ὁ στύλος ὁ δεύτερος.
**16** Καὶ δύο ἐπιθέματα ἐποίησε δοῦναι ἐπὶ τὰς κεφαλὰς τῶν στύλων
χωνευτά, χαλκᾶ· πέντε πήχεις τὸ ὕψος τοῦ ἐπιθέματος τοῦ ἑνός,
**17** καὶ πέντε πήχεις τὸ ὕψος τοῦ ἐπιθέματος τοῦ δευτέρου. Καὶ
ἐποίησε δύο δίκτυα περικαλύψαι τὰ ἐπίθεμα τῶν στύλων· καὶ δίκτυον
**18** τῷ ἐπιθέματι τῷ ἑνί, καὶ δίκτυον τῷ ἐπιθέματι τῷ δευτέρῳ. Καὶ
ἔργον κρεμαστόν, δύο στίχοι ῥοῶν χαλκῶν, δεδικτυωμένοι, ἔργον κρε-
μαστῶν, στίχος ἐπὶ στίχον· καὶ οὕτως ἐποίησε τῷ ἐπιθέματι τῷ δευτέρῳ.
**19** Καὶ ἐπιθέματα ἐπὶ τῶν κεφαλῶν τῶν στύλων, ἔργον κρίνου, κατὰ τὸ
**20** αἰλάμ, τεσσάρων πηχῶν. Καὶ μέλαθρον ἐπ᾿ ἀμφοτέρων τῶν στύλων,
καὶ ἐπάνωθεν τῶν πλευρῶν ἐπίθεμα μέλαθρον, καὶ τῶν ῥόων πέντε στίχοι κύκλῳ ἐπὶ τῆς κεφαλῖδος τῆς δευτέρας.
**21** Καὶ ἔστησε τοὺς στύλους τοῦ αἰλὰμ τοῦ ναοῦ· καὶ ἔστησε τὸν στύλον
τὸν ἕνα, καὶ ἐπεκάλεσε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ἰαχούν· καὶ ἔστησε τὸν
**22** στύλον τὸν δεύτερον, καὶ ἐπεκάλεσε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Βοός. Καὶ
ἐπὶ τῶν κεφαλῶν ἔργον κρίνου, καὶ ἐτελειώθη τὸ ἔργον τῶν στύλων.
**23** Καὶ ἐποίησε τὴν θάλασσαν αὐτὴν δέκα ἐν πήχει ἀπὸ τοῦ
χείλους αὐτῆς ἕως τοῦ χείλους αὐτῆς, στρογγύλον κύκλῳ τὸ αὐτό· πέντε ἐν πήχει ὕψος αὐτῆς, καὶ συνηγμένοι τρεῖς καὶ τριάκοντα
**24** ἐν πήχει ἐκύκλουν αὐτὴν κύκλῳ. Καὶ ὑποστηρίγματα ὑποκάτωθεν τοῦ χείλους αὐτῆς κυκλόθεν ἐκύκλουν αὐτὴν δέκα ἐν πήχει κυκλόθεν· δύο στίχοι τῶν ὑποστηριγμάτων κεχυμένοι ἐν τῇ
**25** χύσει αὐτῆς ἑστῶτες. Καὶ δώδεκα βόες ὑποκάτω τῆς θαλάσσης,
οἱ τρεῖς ἐπιβλέποντες βορρᾶν, καὶ οἱ τρεῖς ἐπιβλέποντες θάλασσαν,
καὶ οἱ τρεῖς ἐπιβλέποντες Νότον, καὶ οἱ τρεῖς ἐπιβλέποντες ἀνα-
τολήν, καὶ ἡ θάλασσα ἐπ᾿ αὐτῶν ἐπάνωθεν, καὶ πάντα τὰ ὀπί-
**26** σθια εἰς τὸν οἶκον. Καὶ τὸ πάγος αὐτοῦ παλαιστής· καὶ τὸ χείλος αὐτῆς ὡς ἔργον χείλους ποτηρίου, βλάστος κρίνου, δισχιλίους
**27** χοεῖς χωροῦντας. Καὶ ἐποίησε τὰς Μεχωνὼθ δέκα χαλκᾶς,
**28** πέντε πήχεις μῆκος τῆς Μεχωνὼδ τῆς μιᾶς, καὶ τέσσαρες πήχεις
πλάτος αὐτῆς, καὶ ἓξ πήχει ὕψος αὐτῆς. Καὶ τοῦτο τὸ ἔργον
τῶν Μεχωνώδ, συγκλειστὸν αὐτοῖς, καὶ συγκλειστὸν ἀναμέσον τῶν
ἐξεχομένων.
**29** Καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ συγκλείσματα αὐτῶν ἀναμέσον ἐξεχομένων
λέοντες καὶ βόες καὶ χερουβείμ· καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν ἐξεχομένων, οὕτω
καὶ ἐπάνωθεν καὶ ὑποκάτωθεν τῶν λεόντων καὶ τῶν βοῶν χῶραι, ἔργον καταβάσεως.
**30** Καὶ τέσσαρες τροχοὶ χαλκοῖ τῇ Μεχωνὼθ τῇ μιᾷ, καὶ τὰ προσέχοντα χαλκᾶ, καὶ τέσσαρα μέση αὐτῶν, ὦμίαι αὐτοῖς ὑποκάτω τῶν λουτήρων, αἱ ὦμίαι κεχυμέναι ἀπὸ πέραν ἀνδρὸς προσκείμεναι.
**31** Καὶ στόμα αὐτοῦ ἔσωθεν τῆς κεφαλίδος ἄνωθεν ἐν πήχει, καὶ στόμα αὐτοῦ στρογγυλοῦν ποίημα οὕτω πήχεως, καὶ ἡμίσους τοῦ πήχεως· καὶ γε ἐπὶ στόματος αὐτοῦ διατορεύματα, καὶ διάπηγα αὐτῶν τετράγωνα, οὐ στρογγύλα.
**32** Καὶ τέσσαρες τροχοὶ εἰς ὑποκάτωθεν τῶν διαπήγων, καὶ χεῖρες ἐν τοῖς τροχοῖς· ἐν τῇ Μεχωνώθ· καὶ τὸ ὕψος τοῦ τροχοῦ τοῦ ἑνὸς πήχεως, καὶ ἡμίσους τοῦ πήχεως.
**33** Καὶ τὸ ἔργον τῶν τροχῶν ἔργον τροχῶν ἅρματος· αἱ χεῖρες αὐτῶν, καὶ αὐχένες αὐτῶν, καὶ οἱ νῶτοι αὐτῶν, καὶ ἡ πραγματεία αὐτῶν ἴσα πάντα χωρευτά.
**34** Αἱ τέσσαρες ὦμίαι ἐπὶ τῶν τεσσάρων γωνιῶν τῆς μεχωνὼθ τῆς μιᾶς, ἐκ τῆς μεχωνὼθ οἱ ὦμοι αὐτῆς.
**35** Καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς κεφαλῆς τῆς μεχωνὼθ ἥμισυ τοῦ πήχεως μέγεθος στρογγύλον κύκλῳ ἐπὶ τῆς κεφαλῆς τῆς μεχωνώθ· καὶ ἀρχὴ χειρῶν αὐτῆς καὶ τὰ συγκλείσματα αὐτῆς ἐξ αὐτῆς· καὶ ἠνοίγετο ἐπὶ τὰς ἀρχὰς τῶν χειρῶν αὐτῆς.
**36** Καὶ τὰ συγκλείσματα αὐτῆς χερουβείμ, καὶ λέοντες, καὶ φοίνικες, ἑστῶτα, ἐχόμενον ἕκαστον κατὰ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἔσω καὶ τὰ κυκλόθεν.
**37** Κατ᾽ αὐτὴν ἐποίησε πάσας τὰς δέκα μεχωνώθ, τάξις μία, καὶ μέτρον ἕν, τέρμα ἕν πάσαις.
**38** Καὶ ἐποίησε δέκα χυτρογαύλους χαλκοῦς, τεσσαράκοντα χοεῖς χωροῦντα τὸν χυτρόγαυλον τὸν ἕνα τεσσάρων πηχῶν· ὁ χυτρόγαυλος ὁ εἷς ἐπὶ τῆς μεχωνὼθ τῆς μιᾶς ταῖς δέκα μεχωνώθ.
**39** Καὶ ἔθετο τὰς μεχωνὼδ πέντε ἀπὸ τῆς ὦμίας τοῦ οἴκου ἐκ δεξιῶν, καὶ πέντε ἐπ᾽ ὦμίαν τοῦ οἴκου ἐξ ἀριστερῶν αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἡ θάλασσα ἀπὸ τῆς ὦμίδος τοῦ οἴκου ἐκ δεξιῶν κατ᾽ ἀνατολὰς ἀπὸ τοῦ κλίτους τοῦ νότου.
**40** Καὶ ἐποίησε Χειρὰμ τοὺς λέβητας, καὶ τὰς θερμαστρεῖς, καὶ τὰς φιάλας· καὶ συνετέλεσε Χειρὰμ ποιῶν πάντα τὰ ἔργα ἃ ἐποίησε τῷ βασιλεῖ Σαλωμὼν ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου.

**2. A Royal Translation of the Third Book of Kingdoms, Chapter 7**

**Chapter 7**

**14** ...a son of a widow woman, and he was of the tribe of Naphtali; and
his father was a man of renown, a worker in bronze, and filled
with skill, and understanding, and knowledge to do all manner of work
in bronze: and he was brought unto King Solomon, and he made
**15** all the works. And he cast the two pillars for the porch
of the house, eighteen cubits was the height of the pillar, and a circumference
of fourteen cubits did encompass it; the thickness of the pillar,
[even] the hollow parts, [was] four fingers: and so was the second pillar.
**16** And two capitals he made to be placed upon the heads of the pillars,
molten, of bronze; five cubits was the height of the one capital,
**17** and five cubits was the height of the second capital. And
he made two networks to cover the capitals of the pillars; and a network
**18** for the one capital, and a network for the second capital. And
[he made] a hanging work, two rows of bronze pomegranates, interwoven, a
hanging work, row upon row; and thus he made for the second capital.
**19** And capitals upon the heads of the pillars, [wrought with] lily-work, according to the
**20** porch, [measuring] four cubits. And a beam upon both the pillars,
and above, upon the sides, a capital beam, and of the pomegranates
five rows round about upon the second chapiter.
**21** And he set up the pillars of the porch of the temple; and he set up the
one pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin; and he set up the
**22** second pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz. And
upon the heads [was] lily-work, and so was the work of the pillars finished.
**23** And he made the Sea itself, ten cubits [in diameter] from its
brim unto its brim, perfectly round; five cubits was its height, and
gathered thirty and three cubits did encompass it round about.
**24** And projections beneath its brim, round about, did encompass it, ten [projections]
per cubit, all around; two rows of the projections were cast in its
casting, [as they stood].
**25** And twelve oxen [were] beneath the Sea,
three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the sea,
and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the
east; and the Sea [was set] upon them above, and all the hind parts [were]
**26** backwards, into the house. And its thickness [was] a handbreadth; and its brim
[was] like the work of the brim of a cup, [with] a lily bloom,
containing two thousand baths.
**27** And he made the ten bases of bronze;
**28** five cubits was the length of the one base, and four cubits
the breadth thereof, and six cubits the height thereof. And this was the work
of the bases: [it was] enclosed for them, and enclosed between the
projections.
**29** And upon their enclosures, between the projections, [were]
lions and oxen and cherubim; and upon the projections, likewise,
both above and beneath the lions and the oxen, [were] panels,
[with] chased work.
**30** And four bronze wheels for the one base, and their attachments [were]
of bronze, and four axles [were] among them; supports for them beneath
the lavers, the supports cast [such as extend] from beyond a man, [and were] affixed.
**31** And its mouth within the capital above, [was] of one cubit,
and its mouth, [being] a round work, [was] thus of a cubit
and half a cubit; and indeed upon its mouth [were] carvings,
and their panels [were] four-square, not round.
**32** And four wheels [were placed] beneath the panels, and [there were]
spokes in the wheels, within the base; and the height of the
one wheel [was] a cubit and half a cubit.
**33** And the work of the wheels [was like] the work of chariot wheels;
their spokes, and their hubs, and their felloes, and their construction
were all of them cast alike.
**34** The four supports were upon the four corners of the
one base; from the base were its supports.
**35** And upon the top of the base, half a cubit [was] its round
size round about upon the top of the base; and the beginning of its supports
and its enclosures [were] from it; and it opened upon the beginnings of its supports.
**36** And its enclosures [were decorated with] cherubim, and lions, and palm trees,
standing, each one situated according to its own aspect, within and round about.
**37** After this manner he made all the ten bases;
one pattern, and one measure, one finishing for all of them.
**38** And he made ten bronze lavers, containing forty baths,
each one laver of four cubits; the one laver [was placed]
upon the one base, [this being so] for the ten bases.
**39** And he set the bases, five from the side of the house on the right hand,
and five toward the side of the house on the left hand thereof; and the Sea
[he placed] from the side of the house on the right hand, eastward,
from the south side.
**40** And Hiram made the pots, and the shovels, and the bowls;
and Hiram finished doing all the works which he made for King
Solomon in the House of the Lord.
