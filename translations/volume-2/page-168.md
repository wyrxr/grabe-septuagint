ΚΕΦ. ΙΖ΄. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Γ΄. 644
ἐπεστράφη ἡ ψυχὴ τοῦ παιδαρίου πρὸς ἔγκατον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔζησε.
23 Καὶ ἔλαβεν Ἠλιοὺ τὸ παιδάριον, καὶ κατήγαγεν αὐτὸν ἀπὸ τοῦ
ὑπερῴου εἰς τὸν οἶκον, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὸ τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ· καὶ εἶ-
24 πεν Ἠλιοὺ· βλέπε, ζῇ ὁ υἱός σου. Καὶ εἶπεν ἡ γυνὴ πρὸς Ἠλιοὺ·
ἰδοὺ τοῦτο ἔγνωκα ὅτι ἄνθρωπος Θεοῦ εἶ, καὶ ῥῆμα Κυρίου ἐν
στόματί σου ἀληθινόν.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΗ΄. XVIII.

1 ΚΑὶ ἐγένετο μεθ᾿ ἡμέρας πολλὰς, καὶ ῥῆμα Κυρίου ἐγένετο
πρὸς Ἠλιοὺ ἐν τῷ ἐνιαυτῷ τῷ τρίτῳ, λέγων· πορεύθητι, καὶ ὄ-
2 φθητι τῷ Ἀχαάβ, καὶ δώσω ὑετὸν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον τῆς γῆς. Καὶ
ἐπορεύθη Ἠλιοὺ τοῦ ὀφθῆναι τῷ Ἀχαάβ, καὶ ἦν λιμὸς κραταιὸς
3 ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ. Καὶ ἐκάλεσεν Ἀχαὰβ τὸν Ἀβδιοὺ τὸν οἰκονόμον·
4 καὶ Ἀβδιοὺ ἦν φοβούμενος τὸν Κύριον σφόδρα. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ
τύπτειν Ἰεζάβελ τοὺς προφήτας Κυρίου, καὶ ἔλαβεν Ἀβδιοὺ ἑκα-
τὸν ἄνδρας προφήτας, καὶ ἔκρυψεν αὐτοὺς κατὰ πεντήκοντα ἐν σπη-
5 λαίῳ, καὶ διέτρεφεν αὐτοὺς ἐν ἄρτῳ καὶ ὕδατι. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἀχα-
ἀβ πρὸς Ἀβδιοὺ· δεῦρο, καὶ διέλθωμεν εἰς τὸ πεδίον ἐπὶ τὰς πη-
γὰς τῶν ὑδάτων, καὶ ἐπὶ πάντας χειμάρρους, ἐάν πως εὕρωμεν
βοτάνην, καὶ περιποιησώμεθα ἵππους, καὶ ἡμιόνους, καὶ οὐχ ἐξολο-
6 θρευθήσονται ἀπὸ τῶν κτηνῶν. Καὶ ἐμέρισαν αὐτοῖς τὴν ὁδὸν τοῦ
διελθεῖν αὐτήν· Ἀχαὰβ ἐπορεύθη ἐν ὁδῷ ἄλλῃ μόνος, καὶ Ἀβδιοὺ
7 ἐπορεύθη ἐν ὁδῷ ἄλλῃ μόνος. Καὶ ἦν Ἀβδιοὺ ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ· καὶ ἀ-
πῆλθεν Ἠλιοὺ εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτοῦ μόνος· καὶ Ἀβδιοὺ ἔσπευσε,
καὶ ἔπεσεν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπεν· εἰ σὺ εἶ αὐτὸς, κύ-
8 ριέ μου Ἠλιού; Καὶ εἶπεν Ἠλιοὺ αὐτῷ· ἐγώ· πορεύου, εἶπον
τῷ κυρίῳ σου, ἰδοὺ Ἠλιού. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἀβδιοὺ· τί ἡμάρτηκα, ὅτι
10 δώσεις τὸν δοῦλόν σου εἰς χεῖρας Ἀχαὰβ τοῦ θανατῶσαί με; Ζῇ
Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου, εἰ ἔστιν ἔθνος ἢ βασιλεία, οὗ οὐκ ἀπέσταλ-
κέ (με) ὁ κύριός μου ζητεῖν σε· καὶ εἶπον, οὐχ ἔστι· καὶ ἐνέπρη-
11 σε τὰς χώρας αὐτῆς, καὶ τὴν βασιλείαν, ὅτι οὐχ εὕρηκέ σε. Καὶ
νῦν, πορεύου, σὺ λέγεις, καὶ ἀνάγγελε τῷ κυρίῳ σου, ἰδοὺ Ἠλιού.
12 Καὶ ἔσται ἐὰν ἐγὼ ἀπέλθω ἀπὸ σοῦ, καὶ πνεῦμα Κυρίου ἀρεῖ σε
εἰς γῆν ἣν οὐκ οἶδα, καὶ εἰσελεύσομαι ἀπαγγεῖλαι τῷ Ἀχαάβ,
καὶ οὐχ εὑρήσει σε, καὶ ἀποκτενεῖ με· καὶ ὁ δοῦλός σου ἐστὶ φο-

### Kings III, Chapter 17

**22** And the soul of the child returned unto his inward parts, and he lived.
**23** And Elijah took the child, and brought him down from the upper room into the house, and delivered him unto his mother. And Elijah said, "Behold, thy son liveth!"
**24** And the woman said unto Elijah, "Behold, now I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of the Lord in thy mouth is truth."

### Chapter 18

**1** And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the Lord came unto Elijah in the third year, saying, "Go, and shew thyself unto Ahab; and I shall send rain upon the face of the earth."
**2** So Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And there was a mighty famine in Samaria.
**3** And Ahab called unto Abdiou, his steward.
**4** Now Abdiou feared the Lord greatly. And it came to pass, when Jezebel did cut off the prophets of the Lord, that Abdiou took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and nourished them with bread and water.
**5** And Ahab said unto Abdiou, "Come, let us pass through the land unto the springs of water, and unto all the brooks, if perchance we may find fodder, and thereby preserve the horses and mules, so that they may not be utterly destroyed from among the beasts."
**6** And they divided the way between them, that they might pass through it. Ahab went by one way alone, and Abdiou went by another way alone.
**7** And as Abdiou was on the way, behold, Elijah went alone to meet him. And Abdiou hastened, and fell upon his face, and said, "Art thou indeed he, my lord Elijah?"
**8** And Elijah said unto him, "I am. Go, tell thy lord, 'Behold, Elijah [is here].'"
**9** Then said Abdiou, "What sin have I committed, that thou wouldst deliver thy servant into the hands of Ahab to slay me?"
**10** "As the Lord thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent [me] to seek thee. And when they said, 'He is not [here],' then did he burn its lands and the kingdom, because he found thee not."
**11** "And now, thou sayest, 'Go, and tell thy lord, 'Behold, Elijah [is here].'"
**12** "And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am departed from thee, that the Spirit of the Lord shall carry thee into a land which I know not; and when I shall come to tell Ahab, and he shall not find thee, then will he slay me. And thy servant is [one who] feareth—"
