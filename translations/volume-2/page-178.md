ΚΕΦ. ΚΑ΄.
16 οὐκ ἔστι Ναβουθαὶ ζῶν, ὅτι τέθνηκε. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἤκουσεν
Ἀχαάβ, ὅτι τέθνηκε Ναβουθαὶ ὁ Ἰεζραηλίτης, καὶ διέρρηξε τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ, καὶ περιεβάλετο σάκχον. Καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ ταῦτα,
καὶ ἀνέστη Ἀχαάβ, καὶ κατέβη εἰς τὸν ἀμπελῶνα Ναβουθαὶ τοῦ
17 Ἰεζραηλίτου κληρονομῆσαι αὐτόν. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Ἠλιοὺ
18 τὸν Θεσβίτην, λέγων· ἀνάστηθι, καὶ κατάβηθι εἰς ἀπάντησιν Ἀχαάβ βασιλέως Ἰσραὴλ τοῦ ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ, ὅτι οὗτος ἐν ἀμπελῶνι Ναβουθαὶ ὅτι καταβέβηκεν ἐκεῖ κληρονομῆσαι αὐτόν.
19 Καὶ λαλήσεις πρὸς αὐτόν, λέγων· τάδε λέγει Κύριος· ὡς σὺ ἐφόνευσας, καὶ ἐκληρονόμησας, διὰ τοῦτο τάδε λέγει Κύριος· ἐν παντὶ
τόπῳ ᾧ ἔλειξαν οἱ κύνες καὶ αἱ ὗες τὸ αἷμα Ναβουθαί, ἐκεῖ λείξουσιν οἱ κύνες τὸ αἷμά σου, καὶ πόρναι λούσονται ἐν τῷ αἵμα20 τί σου. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἀχαάβ πρὸς Ἠλιού· εἰ εὕρηκάς με ἐχθρός
μου; καὶ εἶπεν· εὕρηκα· διότι μάτην πέπρασαι, ποιῆσαι τὸ πονηρὸν ἐνώπιον Κυρίου, παροργίσαι αὐτόν.
21 Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐπάγω ἐπὶ σὲ κακά· καὶ ἐκκαύσω ὀπίσω σου, καὶ ἐξολοθρεύσω τοῦ Ἀχαάβ
οὐροῦντα πρὸς τοῖχον, καὶ συνεγχόμενον καὶ ἐγκαταλελειμμένον ἐν
22 Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ δώσω τὸν οἶκόν σου ὡς τὸν οἶκον Ἱεροβοὰμ υἱοῦ
Ναβάτ, καὶ ὡς τὸν οἶκον Βαασὰ υἱοῦ Ἀχιά, περὶ τῶν παροργισμάτων ὧν παρώργισας, καὶ ἐξήμαρτες τὸν Ἰσραήλ.
23 Καὶ τῇ Ἰεζάβελ ἐλάλησε Κύριος, λέγων· οἱ κύνες καταφάγονται αὐτὴν ἐν
24 τῷ προτειχίσματι τοῦ Ἰεζράελ. Τὸν τεθνηκότα τοῦ Ἀχαὰβ ἐν τῇ
πόλει καταφάγονται οἱ κύνες, καὶ τὸν τεθνηκότα αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ καταφάγονται τὰ πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ.
25 Πλὴν ματαίως ἐπράθη Ἀχαάβ, ὃς ἐπράθη τοῦ ποιῆσαι τὸ πονηρὸν ἐνώπιον Κυρίου,
26 ὡς μετέθηκεν αὐτὸν Ἰεζάβελ ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐβδελύχθη σφόδρα πορεύεσθαι ὀπίσω τῶν ἐθελυγμάτων κατὰ πάντα ἃ ἐποίησεν
ὁ Ἀμορραῖος, ὃν ἐξωλόθρευσε Κύριος ἀπὸ προσώπου υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ.
27 Καὶ ὑπὲρ τοῦ λόγου οὗ κατενύγη Ἀχαάβ ἀπὸ προσώπου Κυρίου, καὶ ἐπορεύετο κλαίων, καὶ διέρρηξε τὸν χιτῶνα αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐζώσατο σάκχον ἐπὶ τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐνήστευσε, καὶ
περιεβάλετο σάκχον ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ᾗ ἐπάταξε Ναβουθαὶ τὸν Ἰεζραηλίτην, καὶ ἐπορεύθη κεκλιμένος.
28 Καὶ ἐγένετο ῥῆμα Κυρίου ἐν χειρὶ δούλου αὐτοῦ Ἠλιοὺ περὶ Ἀχαάβ, καὶ εἶπε Κύριος·
29 ἑώρακας ὡς κατενύγη Ἀχαάβ ἀπὸ προσώπου μου; οὐκ ἐπάξω τὴν κακίαν

**Chapter 21**

**(continued from verse 15)**
"...Naboth is not living, for he is dead. And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth the Jezreelite was dead, that he rent his garments, and clothed himself with sackcloth. And it came to pass after these things, that Ahab arose, and went down unto the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite to inherit it.

**17** And the Lord said unto Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
**18** "Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who dwelleth in Samaria; for behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, for he is gone down thither to inherit it.
**19** And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, 'Thus saith the Lord: As thou hast murdered, and taken possession, therefore thus saith the Lord: In every place where the dogs and the swine did lick the blood of Naboth, there shall the dogs lick thy blood, and harlots shall wash themselves in thy blood.'"
**20** And Ahab said unto Elijah, "Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?" And he answered, "I have found thee; because thou art sold for naught to work wickedness in the sight of the Lord, to provoke Him to anger.
**21** Behold, I will bring upon thee evils: and I will utterly consume after thee, and will cut off from Ahab every male that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and him that is left desolate in Israel.
**22** And I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocations wherewith thou hast provoked [Me to anger], and hast made Israel to sin.
**23** And of Jezebel also spake the Lord, saying, 'The dogs shall eat her in the rampart of Jezreel.'
**24** Him that dieth of Ahab in the city shall the dogs devour; and him that dieth of his [house] in the field shall the fowls of the heaven devour.
**25** But Ahab was sold for naught, yea, he was sold to work wickedness in the sight of the Lord,
**26** according as Jezebel his wife did incite him. And he did exceedingly make himself abominable by going after idols, according to all the things that the Amorite did, whom the Lord had utterly destroyed from before the face of the children of Israel.
**27** And concerning the word wherewith Ahab was pierced to the heart before the Lord, he went weeping, and rent his tunic, and girded his body with sackcloth, and fasted; yea, he put on sackcloth on the very day that Naboth the Jezreelite was smitten, and he walked bowed down [in sorrow].
**28** And the word of the Lord came unto Elijah, His servant, concerning Ahab, saying,
**29** 'Hast thou seen how Ahab hath been humbled before My face? I will not bring the evil..."
