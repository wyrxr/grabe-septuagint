σίας μου. βδελύσσομαι αὐτὸ ὡς ῥάκος καταμηνίων, καὶ οὐ φορῶ
αὐτὸ ἐν ἡμέραις ἡσυχίας μου. καὶ οὐκ ἔφαγεν ἡ δούλη σου τράπεζαν Ἀμάν, καὶ οὐκ ἐδόξασα συμπόσιον βασιλέως, οὐδὲ ἔπιον
οἶνον σπονδῶν. καὶ οὐκ ηὐφράνθη ἡ δούλη σου ἀφ᾽ ἡμέρας μεταβολῆς μου μέχρι νῦν, πλὴν ἐπὶ σοὶ Κύριε ὁ Θεὸς Ἀβραάμ. ὁ Θεὸς
ὁ ἰσχύων ἐπὶ πάντας, εἰσάκουσον φωνῆς ἀπηλπισμένων, καὶ ῥῦσαι
ἡμᾶς ἐκ χειρὸς τῶν πονηρευομένων, καὶ ῥῦσαι με ἐκ τοῦ φόβου μου.

ΚΕΦ. Ε΄. V.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐγενήθη ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τρίτῃ ὡς ἐπαύσατο προσευχομένη, ἐξεδύσατο τὰ ἱμάτια τῆς θεραπείας, καὶ περιεβάλετο τὴν
δόξαν αὐτῆς. καὶ γενηθεῖσα ἐπιφανής, ἐπικαλεσαμένη τὸν πάντων
ἐπόπτην Θεὸν καὶ σωτῆρα, παρέλαβε τὰς δύο ἄβρας. καὶ τῇ μὲν
μιᾷ ἐπηρείδοτο ὡς τρυφευομένη, ἡ δὲ ἑτέρα ἐπηκολούθει κουφίζουσα τὴν ἔνδυσιν αὐτῆς. καὶ αὐτὴ ἐρυθριῶσα ἀκμῇ κάλλους αὐτῆς. καὶ τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτῆς ἱλαρόν, ὡς προσφιλές. ἡ δὲ καρδία
αὐτῆς ἀπεστενωμένη ἀπὸ τοῦ φόβου. καὶ εἰσελθοῦσα πάσας τὰς
θύρας, ἔστη ἐνώπιον τοῦ βασιλέως. καὶ αὐτὸς ἐκάθητο ἐπὶ τοῦ θρόνου τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὴν στολὴν τῆς ἐπιφανείας αὐτοῦ
ἐνδεδύκει, ὅλος διὰ χρυσοῦ καὶ λίθων πολυτελῶν, καὶ ἦν φοβερὸς
σφόδρα. καὶ ἦρε τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ πεπυρωμένον δόξῃ, ἐν ἀκμῇ
θυμοῦ· καὶ ἔπεσεν ἡ βασίλισσα, καὶ μετέβαλε τὸ χρῶμα αὐτῆς ἐν
ἐκλύσει, καὶ ἐπέκυψεν ἐπὶ τῆς κεφαλῆς τῆς ἄβρας τῆς προπορευομένης αὐτῆς, καὶ μετέβαλεν ὁ Θεὸς τὸ πνεῦμα τοῦ βασιλέως εἰς
πραΰτητα, καὶ ἀγωνιάσας ἀνεπηδήσεν ἀπὸ τοῦ θρόνου αὐτοῦ, καὶ
ἀνέλαβεν αὐτὴν ἐπὶ τὰς ἀγκάλας αὐτοῦ μέχρις οὗ κατέστη. καὶ
παρεκάλει αὐτὴν λόγοις εἰρηνικοῖς, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ· τί ἐστιν Ἑσθήρ;
ἐγὼ δ᾽ ἀδελφός σου, θάρσει, οὐ μὴ ἀποθάνῃς· ὅτι κοινὸν τὸ πρόσταγμα ἡμῶν ἐστι· πρόσελθε.
2 Καὶ ἄρας τὴν χρυσῆν ῥάβδον, ἐπέθηκεν ἐπὶ τὸν τράχηλον αὐτῆς, καὶ ἠσπάσατο τὴν Ἑσθήρ, καὶ
εἶπε· λάλῃσόν μοι· καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· εἶδόν σε Κύριε ὡς ἄγγελον
Θεοῦ, καὶ ἐταράχθη ἡ καρδία μου ἀπὸ φόβου τῆς δόξης σου, ὅτι
θαυμαστὸς εἶ Κύριε, καὶ τὸ πρόσωπόν σου χαρίτων μεστόν· ἐν δὲ
τῷ διαλέγεσθαι αὐτὴν ἔπεσεν ἀπὸ ἐκλύσεως αὐτῆς. Καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐταράσσετο, καὶ πᾶσα ἡ θεραπεία αὐτοῦ παρεκάλει αὐτήν.

...-ance. I detest it as a rag of menstrual cloths, and I wear it not in the days of my tranquility. And Thy handmaiden hath not eaten at the table of Haman, nor have I glorified the king's banquet, neither have I drunk the wine of [pagan] libations. And Thy handmaiden hath not rejoiced from the day of my elevation until now, save in Thee, O Lord, the God of Abraham. O God, who art mighty over all, hearken unto the voice of them that have despaired, and deliver us from the hand of them that work wickedness, and deliver me from my fear.

### Chapter 5

1 Now it came to pass on the third day, as she ceased her prayer, she took off the garments of her humiliation and put on her royal splendor. And, having become radiant, she called upon the God and Savior, the Overseer of all, and took her two maids. And upon the one she leaned, as one pampered in luxury, whilst the other followed, lightening her attire. And she herself was blushing with the fullness of her beauty, and her face was cheerful, as if beloved. But her heart was sore distressed by fear.

And having passed through all the doors, she stood before the king. And he sat upon the throne of his kingdom, and was clad in the robe of his majesty, [all] of gold and precious stones, and he was exceedingly terrible. And he lifted up his face, inflamed with glory, in the height of his wrath; and the queen fell, and her countenance changed with faintness, and she leaned upon the head of her maid that went before her.

And God changed the spirit of the king to gentleness, and, being in anguish, he leaped from his throne, and took her into his arms until she was settled. And he comforted her with words of peace, and said unto her: "What is it, Esther? I am thy brother, be of good courage, thou shalt not die; for this commandment is common unto us both. Draw nigh."

2 And taking the golden scepter, he laid it upon her neck, and embraced Esther, and said, "Speak unto me." And she said unto him, "I saw thee, O Lord, as an angel of God, and my heart was troubled from fear of thy glory, for thou art wonderful, O Lord, and thy face is full of grace." But while she was speaking, she fell again from her faintness. And the king was troubled, and all his attendants comforted her.
