ΚΕΦ. Θʹ. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Γʹ. 623
9 τίνος ἐποίησε Κύριος οὕτως τῇ γῇ ταύτῃ, καὶ τῷ οἴκῳ τούτῳ;
Καὶ ἐροῦσιν, ᾿Ανθ᾿ ὧν ἐγκατέλιπον τὸν Κύριον Θεὸν αὐτῶν, ὃς
ἐξήγαγε τοὺς πατέρας αὐτῶν, ἐξ Αἰγύπτου ἐξ οἴκου δουλείας, καὶ
ἀντελάβοντο θεῶν ἑτέρων, καὶ προσεκύνησαν αὐτοῖς, διὰ τοῦτο ἐ-
πήγαγε Κύριος ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς σύμπασαν τὴν κακίαν ταύτην.
10 Τότε ἀνήγαγε Σαλωμὼν τὴν θυγατέρα Φαραὼ ἐκ πόλεως Δαυὶδ εἰς τὸν
οἶκον αὑτοῦ, ὃν ᾠκοδόμησεν ἑαυτῷ. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν ταῖς ἡμέ-
ραις ἐκείναις, εἴκοσιν ἔτη ἐν οἷς ᾠκοδόμησε Σαλωμὼν τοὺς δύο
οἴκους, τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου, καὶ τὸν οἶκον τοῦ βασιλέως.
11 Χειρὰμ βασιλεὺς Τύρου ἀντελάβετο τοῦ Σαλωμὼν ἐν ξύλοις κεδίνοις, καὶ
ἐν χρυσίῳ, καὶ παντὶ θελήματι αὐτοῦ· τότε ᾠκοδόμησεν ὁ βασι-
λεὺς Σαλωμὼν τῷ Χειρὰμ εἴκοσι πόλεις ἐν τῇ γῇ τῇ Γαλιλαίᾳ.
12 Καὶ ἐξῆλθε Χειρὰμ ἐκ Τύρου, καὶ ἐπορεύθη εἰς τὴν Γαλιλαίαν
τοῦ ἰδεῖν τὰς πόλεις ἃς ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ Σαλωμὼν· καὶ οὐκ ἤρεσαν
αὐτῷ.
13 Καὶ εἶπε, τί αἱ πόλεις αὗται ἃς ἔδωκάς μοι, ἀδελφέ; καὶ
ἐκάλεσεν αὐτάς, Ὄριον, ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης.
14 Καὶ ἤνεγκε Χειρὰμ τῷ Σαλωμὼν ἑκατὸν καὶ εἴκοσι τάλαντα χρυσίου.
15 Αὕτη ἡ πραγματεία τῆς προνομῆς, ἧς ἀνήνεγκεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Σαλω-
μὼν οἰκοδομῆσαι τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου, καὶ τὸν οἶκον τοῦ βασιλέως,
καὶ σὺν τὴν Μελλώ, καὶ τὴν ἄκραν, τοῦ περιφράξαι τὸν φραγμὸν
τῆς πόλεως Δαυίδ, καὶ τὴν ᾿Ασσοὺρ, καὶ σὺν τὴν Μεδὼν, καὶ τὸ
τεῖχος Ἱερουσαλὴμ, καὶ τὴν ᾿Εσὲρ, καὶ τὴν Μαγδὼ, καὶ τὴν Γε-
ζέρ.
16 Φαραὼ βασιλεὺς Αἰγύπτου ἀνέβη, καὶ κατελάβετο τὴν Γε-
ζὲρ, καὶ ἐνέπρησεν αὐτὴν ἐν πυρί, καὶ σὺν τὸν Χαναναῖον τὸν κα-
θήμενον ἐν τῇ πόλει ἀπέκτεινεν· καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὴν ἀποστολὰς τῇ
θυγατρὶ αὐτοῦ, γυναικὶ Σαλωμῶν.
17 Καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν Σαλωμὼν τὴν Γαζὲρ, καὶ τὴν Βαιθωρὼν τὴν κατωτάτην,
18 Καὶ τὴν Βαλαδ, καὶ τὴν Θερμὰθ ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ,
19 Καὶ ἐν τῇ γῇ πάσας τὰς πόλεις τῶν σκηνωμάτων, αἳ ἦσαν τῷ Σαλωμὼν,
καὶ τὰς πόλεις τῶν ἁρμάτων, καὶ πάσας τὰς πόλεις τῶν ἱππέων,
καὶ τὴν πραγματείαν Σαλωμὼν ἣν ἐπραγματεύσατο οἰκοδομῆσαι ἐν
Ἱερουσαλὴμ, καὶ ἐν τῷ Λιβάνῳ, καὶ ἐν πᾶσι τῇ γῇ τοῦ μὴ κατάρξαι
αὐτοῦ.
20 Πάντα τὸν λαὸν τὸν ὑπολελειμμένον ὑπὸ τοῦ ᾿Αμοῤῥαίου, καὶ τοῦ Χετ-
ταίου, καὶ τοῦ Φερεζαίου, καὶ τοῦ Χαναναίου, καὶ τοῦ Εὐαίου,
καὶ τοῦ Ἰεβουσαίου, καὶ τοῦ Γεργεσαίου, τοῦ μὴ ἐκ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσ-
21 ραὴλ ὄντων, τὰ τέκνα αὐτῶν τὰ ὑπολελειμμένα μετ᾿ αὐτοὺς ἐν τῇ
γῇ, οὓς οὐκ ἠδύναντο οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐξολοθρεῦσαι αὐτούς· καὶ
ἀνήγαγεν αὐτοὺς Σαλωμὼν εἰς φόρον δουλείας ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας
ταύτης.

#### CHAPTER 9

**9** ...`Wherefore hath the Lord done thus unto this land, and unto this House?` And they shall answer, `Because they forsook the Lord their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage, and embraced other gods and worshipped them; therefore hath the Lord brought upon them all this evil.`"

**10** Then Solomon brought up Pharaoh’s daughter out of the city of David unto his house, which he had built for himself. And it came to pass in those days, [even] twenty years, in which Solomon had built the two houses, the House of the Lord, and the house of the king.

**11** Now Hiram, king of Tyre, had furnished Solomon with cedar timber, and with gold, and with whatsoever he desired. Then King Solomon built for Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.

**12** And Hiram came out from Tyre, and journeyed into Galilee to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they pleased him not.

**13** And he said, "What cities are these which thou hast given me, my brother?" And he called them [the] Boundary, unto this day.

**14** And Hiram sent to Solomon one hundred and twenty talents of gold.

**15** This is the account of the levy which King Solomon raised to build the House of the Lord, and the house of the king, and also Millo, and the citadel, to fortify the enclosure of the city of David; and Assour, and also Medon, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Magdo, and Gezer.

**16** For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burned it with fire, and slain the Canaanite who dwelt in the city; and had given it as a dowry unto his daughter, Solomon’s wife.

**17** And Solomon built Gezer, and Lower Beth-horon,

**18** And Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness,

**19** And in the land, all the store cities which Solomon had, and the cities for chariots, and all the cities for horsemen; and all the enterprise of Solomon which he undertook to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land, [even that] which he had not yet begun to fully possess.

**20** All the people that were left of the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, who were not of the children of Israel,

**21** their children who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel were not able to utterly destroy, even them did Solomon levy for a tribute of bond-service unto this day.
