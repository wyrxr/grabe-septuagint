**Original Text with Light OCR Corrections:**
βούμενος τὸν Κύριον ἐκ νεότητος αὐτοῦ. Καὶ οὐκ ἀνηγγέλη σοι τῷ κυρίῳ μου οἷα πεποίηκα ἐν τῷ ἀποκτείνειν Ἰεζάβελ τοὺς προφήτας Κυρίου, καὶ ἔκρυψα ἀπὸ τῶν προφητῶν Κυρίου ἑκατὸν ἄνδρας, ἀνὰ πεντήκοντα ἄνδρας ἐν σπηλαίῳ, καὶ ἔθρεψα αὐτοὺς ἐν ἄρτῳ, καὶ ὕδατι; Καὶ νῦν σὺ λέγεις· πορεύου, καὶ λέγε τῷ κυρίῳ σου, ἰδοὺ Ἠλιοὺ· καὶ ἀποκτενεῖ με; Καὶ εἶπεν Ἠλιοὺ· ζῇ Κύριος τῶν δυνάμεων ᾧ παρέστην ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ, ὅτι σήμερον ὀφθήσομαι αὐτῷ. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη Ἀβδιοὺ εἰς συνάντησιν τῷ Ἀχαάβ, καὶ ἀπήγγειλεν αὐτῷ· καὶ ἐξέδραμεν Ἀχαάβ, καὶ ἐπορεύθη εἰς συνάντησιν Ἠλιοὺ. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς εἶδεν Ἀχαὰβ τὸν Ἠλιοὺ, καὶ εἶπεν Ἀχαὰβ πρὸς Ἠλιοὺ· εἰ σὺ εἶ αὐτὸς ὁ διαστρέφων τὸν Ἰσραήλ; Καὶ εἶπεν Ἠλιοὺ· οὐ διαστρέφω τὸν Ἰσραήλ, ὅτι ἀλλ᾿ ἢ σὺ, καὶ ὁ οἶκος τοῦ πατρός σου ἐν τῷ καταλιμπάνειν ὑμᾶς τὸν Κύριον θεὸν ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐπορεύθης ὀπίσω τῶν Βααλέιμ. Καὶ νῦν ἀπόστειλον, συνάθροισον πρὸς μὲ πάντα Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς τὸ ὄρος τὸ Καρμήλιον, καὶ τοὺς προφήτας τοῦ Βαὰλ τετρακοσίους καὶ πεντήκοντα, καὶ προφήτας τῆς αἰσχύνης τετρακοσίους καὶ πεντήκοντα, καὶ τοὺς προφήτας τῶν ἀλσῶν τετρακοσίους, ἐσθίοντας τράπεζαν Ἰεζάβελ. Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ἀχαὰβ εἰς πάντα Ἰσραήλ, καὶ συνήγαγε πάντας τοὺς προφήτας εἰς ὄρος τὸ Καρμήλιον. Καὶ προσήγαγεν Ἠλιοὺ πρὸς πάντα τὸν λαὸν, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς Ἠλιοὺ· ἕως πότε ὑμεῖς χωλανεῖτε ἐπ᾿ ἀμφοτέραις ταῖς ἰγνύαις; εἰ Κύριός ἐστιν ὁ Θεός, πορεύεσθε ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ· εἰ δὲ ὁ Βαὰλ αὐτὸς, πορεύεσθε ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ· καὶ οὐκ ἀπεκρίθη ὁ λαὸς αὐτῷ λόγον. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἠλιοὺ πρὸς τὸν λαὸν· ἐγὼ ὑπολέλειμμαι προφήτης τοῦ Κυρίου μενώτατος· καὶ οἱ προφῆται τοῦ Βαὰλ, τετρακόσιοι καὶ πεντήκοντα ἄνδρες, καὶ προφῆται τοῦ ἄλσους τετρακόσιοι. Δότωσαν ἡμῖν δύο βόας, καὶ ἐκλεξάσθωσαν ἑαυτοῖς τὸν ἕνα, καὶ μελισάτωσαν, καὶ ἐπιθέτωσαν ἐπὶ τῶν ξύλων, καὶ πῦρ μὴ ἐπιθέτωσαν· καὶ ἐγὼ ποιήσω τὸν βοῦν τὸν ἄλλον, καὶ δώσω ἐπὶ τὰ ξύλα, καὶ πῦρ οὐ μὴ ἐπιθῶ. Καὶ βοᾶτε ἐν ὀνόματι Θεοῦ ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐγὼ ἐπικκαλέσομαι ἐν ὀνόματι Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ μου, καὶ ἔσται ὁ Θεὸς ὃς ἐὰν ἐπακούσῃ ἐν πυρί, οὗτος Θεός. Καὶ ἀπεκρίθησαν πᾶς ὁ λαὸς, καὶ εἶπαν· καλὸν τὸ ῥῆμα ὃ ἐλάλησας. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἠλιοὺ τοῖς προφήταις τῆς αἰσχύνης· ἐκλέξασθε ἑαυτοῖς τὸν μόσχον τὸν ἕνα, καὶ ποιήσατε πρῶτοι, ὅτι πολλοὶ ὑμεῖς· καὶ ἐπικαλεῖσθε ἐν ὀνόματι Θεοῦ ὑμῶν,

—**12**— the Lord from his youth. And hath it not been told my lord what things I did, when Jezebel did slay the prophets of the Lord, how I hid an hundred men of the Lord's prophets by fifty in a cave, and nourished them with bread and water?
**13** And now thou sayest, 'Go, and tell thy lord, "Behold, Elijah [is here]"'; and he shall slay me?"
**14** And Elijah said, "As the Lord of Hosts liveth, before Whom I stand, surely this day will I shew myself unto him."
**15** So Abdiou went to meet Ahab, and told him. And Ahab ran out, and went to meet Elijah.
**16** And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto Elijah, "Art thou he that troubleth Israel?"
**17** And Elijah said, "I trouble not Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the Lord your God, and thou hast followed after the Baalim."
**18** "Now therefore, send and gather unto me all Israel unto Mount Carmel; and the prophets of Baal, four hundred and fifty; and the prophets of shame, four hundred and fifty; and the prophets of the groves, four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table."
**19** So Ahab sent unto all Israel, and gathered all the prophets unto Mount Carmel.
**20** And Elijah drew near unto all the people, and Elijah said unto them, "How long halt ye between two opinions? If the Lord be God, follow Him; but if Baal be he, then follow him." And the people answered him not a word.
**21** Then said Elijah unto the people, "I am left [as] a prophet of the Lord, most few [in number]; and the prophets of Baal are four hundred and fifty men, and the prophets of the grove are four hundred."
**22** "Let them therefore give us two oxen; and let them choose for themselves one ox, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under it. And I will dress the other ox, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under it."
**23** "And call ye on the name of your God, and I will call on the name of the Lord my God. And the God that answereth by fire, He is God." And all the people answered and said, "The word which thou hast spoken is good."
**24** And Elijah said unto the prophets of shame, "Choose for yourselves the one calf, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your God,"
