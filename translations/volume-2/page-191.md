**31** Γιεζεὶ διῆλθεν ἔμπροσθεν αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐπέθηκε τὴν βακτηρίαν ἐπὶ
πρόσωπον τοῦ παιδαρίου, καὶ οὐκ ἦν φωνή, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἀκρόασις·
καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν εἰς ἀπάντησιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀπήγγειλεν αὐτῷ, λέ-
γων οὐκ ἠγέρθη τὸ παιδάριον.
**32** Καὶ εἰσῆλθεν Ἐλισσαῖε εἰς τὸν οἶκον, καὶ ἰδοὺ τὸ παιδάριον τεθνηκὸς κεκοιμημένον ἐπὶ τὴν κλίνην αὐτοῦ.
**33** Καὶ εἰσῆλθεν Ἐλισσαῖε εἰς τὸν οἶκον, καὶ ἀπέκλεισε τὴν θύραν κατὰ τῶν δύο αὐτῶν· καὶ προσηύξατο πρὸς Κύριον,
**34** καὶ ἀνέβη καὶ ἐκοιμήθη ἐπὶ τὸ παιδάριον, καὶ ἔθηκε τὸ στόμα ἑαυτοῦ ἐπὶ τὸ
στόμα αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐ-
τοῦ, καὶ τὰς χεῖρας ἑαυτοῦ ἐπὶ τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ· καὶ διέκαμψεν
ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν, καὶ διεθερμάνθη ἡ σὰρξ τοῦ παιδαρίου.
**35** Καὶ ἐπέστρεψε, καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ ἔνθεν καὶ ἔνθεν· καὶ ἀνέβη, καὶ συνέ-
καμψεν ἐπὶ τὸ παιδάριον ἕως ἑπτάκις· καὶ ἤνοιξε τὸ παιδάριον
τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς ἑαυτοῦ.
**36** Καὶ ἐξεβόησεν Ἐλισσαῖε πρὸς Γιεζεὶ, καὶ εἶπε· κάλεσον τὴν Σουναμῖτιν ταύτην. καὶ ἐκάλεσεν αὐτὴν καὶ εἰ-
σῆλθε πρὸς αὐτόν. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἐλισσαῖε· λάβε τὸν υἱόν σου.
**37** Καὶ εἰσῆλθεν ἡ γυνὴ, καὶ ἐπέπεσεν ἐπὶ τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ, καὶ προσ-
εκύνησεν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, καὶ ἔλαβε τὸν υἱὸν αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐξῆλθε.
**38** Καὶ Ἐλισσαῖε ἐπέστρεψεν εἰς Γάλγαλα. καὶ δὲ λιμὸς ἐν τῇ γῇ.
καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ τῶν προφητῶν ἐκάθηντο ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἐλισ-
σαιε τῷ παιδαρίῳ αὐτοῦ· ἐπίστησον τὸν λέβητα τὸν μέγαν, καὶ
ἕψε ἔψημα τοῖς υἱοῖς τῶν προφητῶν.
**39** Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν εἰς τὸν ἀγρὸν συλλέξαι ἀριῶθ᾽· καὶ εὗρεν ἄμπελον ἐν τῷ ἀγρῷ, καὶ συνέλεξεν
ἀπ᾿ αὐτῆς τολύπην ἀγρίαν πλήρες τὸ ἱμάτιον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐλθὼν ἐνέ-
βαλεν εἰς τὸν λέβητα τοῦ ἐψήματος, ὅτι οὐκ ἔγνωσαν.
**40** Καὶ ἐνέχεαν τοῖς ἀνδράσι φαγεῖν· καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἐσθίειν αὐτοὺς ἐκ
τοῦ ἐψήματος, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἀνεβόησαν, καὶ εἶπαν· θάνατος ἐν τῷ λέ-
βητι, ἄνθρωπε τοῦ Θεοῦ· καὶ οὐκ ἠδύναντο φαγεῖν.
**41** Καὶ εἶπε· λάβετε ἄλευρον, καὶ ἐμβάλλετε εἰς τὸν λέβητα. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἐλισ-
σαιε πρὸς Γιεζεὶ τὸ παιδάριον· ἔγχει τῷ λαῷ, καὶ ἐσθιέτωσαν· καὶ
οὐκ ἐγενήθη ἐκεῖ ῥῆμα πονηρὸν ἐν τῷ λέβητι.
**42** Καὶ ἀνὴρ διῆλθεν ἐκ Βααλσαλισὰ, καὶ ἤνεγκε πρὸς τὸν ἄνθρωπον τοῦ Θεοῦ ἄρτους
πρωτογεννημάτων, εἴκοσιν ἄρτους κριθίνους, καὶ παλάθας Βαχελλὼ,
καὶ εἶπε· δότε τῷ λαῷ, καὶ ἐσθιέτωσαν.
**43** Καὶ εἶπεν δὲ λειτουργὸς αὐτοῦ· τί δῶ τοῦτο ἐνώπιον ἑκατὸν ἀνδρῶν; καὶ εἶπε· δὸς τῷ λαῷ,

**THE FOURTH BOOK OF THE KINGS. CHAPTER FOUR.**

**31** And Gehazi passed on before her, and he laid the staff upon the face of the child; yet there was no voice, neither any hearkening. And he turned back to meet him, and reported unto him, saying, "The child hath not awaked."
**32** And Elisha entered into the house, and, behold, the child lay dead upon his bed.
**33** And Elisha went into the house, and he shut the door upon the two of them; and he prayed unto the Lord.
**34** And he went up, and laid himself upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands; and he stretched himself upon him, and the flesh of the child waxed warm.
**35** Then he returned [from the child], and walked in the house, hither and thither; and went up, and bent himself upon the child seven times: and the child opened his eyes.
**36** And Elisha called to Gehazi, and said, "Call this Shunammite woman." So he called her, and she came in unto him. And Elisha said, "Take up thy son."
**37** Then she came in, and fell at his feet, and prostrated herself upon the ground, and took up her son, and went out.
**38** And Elisha returned to Gilgal; and there was a famine in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him. And he said unto his servant, "Set on the great pot, and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets."
**39** And one went out into the field to gather wild herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof a wild gourd, [filling] his garment; and he came and put [them] into the pot of pottage: for they knew not [what they were].
**40** So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out and said, "O man of God, there is death in the pot!" And they could not eat thereof.
**41** And he said, "Bring meal." And he cast it into the pot; and Elisha said unto Gehazi, his servant, "Pour out for the people, and let them eat." And there was no evil thing in the pot.
**42** And there came a man from Baal-shalisha, and brought unto the man of God bread of the firstfruits, even twenty loaves of barley, and cakes of Bacchello; and he said, "Give unto the people, that they may eat."
**43** And his servant said, "How shall I set this before a hundred men?" And he said, "Give unto the people,"
