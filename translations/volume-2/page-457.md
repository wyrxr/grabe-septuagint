κύκλῳ ὀδόντων αὐτοῦ φόβος. Ἔγκατα (δὲ) αὐτοῦ ἀσπίδες χαλ- 6
καῖ, καὶ σύνδεσμος αὐτοῦ ὥσπερ σμυρίτης λίθος, εἷς ἐκ τοῦ ἑνὸς 7
κολλῶνται, πνεῦμα δὲ οὐ μὴ διέλθῃ αὐτόν· ἀνὴρ τῷ ἀδελφῷ αὑ- 8
τοῦ προσκολληθήσεται, συνέχωνται, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἀποσπασθῶσιν. Ἐν 9
πταρμῷ αὐτοῦ ἐπιφώσκεται φέγγος· οἱ δὲ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτοῦ εἶδος 10
ἑωσφόρου. Ἐκ στόματος αὐτοῦ ἐκπορεύονται λαμπάδες καιόμε- 10
ναι, καὶ διαριπτοῦνται ἐσχάραι πυρός· ἐκ μυκτήρων αὐτοῦ ἐκπο- 11
ρεύεται καπνὸς καμίνου καιομένης πυρὶ ἀνθράκων· ἡ ψυχὴ αὐτοῦ 12
ἄνθρακες, φλὸξ δὲ ἐκ στόματος αὐτοῦ ἐκπορεύεται. Ἐν δὲ τρα- 13
χήλῳ αὐτοῦ αὐλίζεται δύναμις· ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ προτρέχει ἀπώ-
λεια. Σάρκες δὲ σώματος αὐτοῦ κεκόλληνται· καταχέει ἐπ᾽ αὐ- 14
τόν, οὐ σαλευθήσεται· ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ πέπηγεν ὥσπερ λίθος, ἔση- 15
κε δὲ ὥσπερ ἄκμων ἀήλατος. Στραφέντος αὐτοῦ, φόβος θηρίοις 16
τετράποσιν ἀλλομένοις ἐπὶ γῆς. Ἐὰν συναντήσωσιν αὐτῷ λόγχαι, 17
οὐδὲν οὐ μὴ ποιήσωσιν αὐτῷ δόρυ ἐπηρμένον καὶ θώραξ· ἤγηται 18
μὲν γὰρ σίδηρον ὥσπερ ἄχυρα, χαλκὸν δὲ ὥσπερ ξύλον σαπρόν· 19
οὐ μὴ τρώσῃ αὐτὸν τόξον χάλκεον· ἤγηται γὰρ πετροβόλον ὡς 19
χόρτον, ὡς καλάμη ἐλογίσθη αὐτῷ σφύρα· καταγελᾷ δὲ σεισμοῦ 20
πυρφόρου. Ἡ στρωμνὴ αὐτοῦ ὀβελίσκοι ὀξεῖς, πᾶς δὲ χρυσὸς θα- 21
λάσσης ὑπ᾽ αὐτὸν ὥσπερ πηλὸς ἀμύθητος. Ἀναζεῖ τὴν ἄβυσσον 22
ὥσπερ χαλκεῖον· ἤγηται δὲ τὴν θάλασσαν ὥσπερ ἐξάλειπτρον, τὸν 23
δὲ τάρταρον τῆς ἀβύσσου ὥσπερ αἰχμάλωτον· ἐλογίσατο ἄβυσσον
εἰς περίπατον. Οὐκ ἔστιν οὐδὲν ἐπὶ γῆς ὅμοιον αὐτῷ, πεποιημέ- 24
νον ἐγκαταπαίζεσθαι ὑπὸ τῶν ἀγγέλων μου· πᾶν ὑψηλὸν ὁρᾷ, αὐ- 25
τὸς δὲ βασιλεὺς πάντων τῶν ἐν τοῖς ὕδασιν.

**ΚΕΦ. ΜΒ΄. XLII.**

ΥΠΟΛΑΒΩΝ δὲ Ἰώβ, λέγει τῷ Κυρίῳ· οἶδα ὅτι δύνασαι 1.2
πάντα, ἀδυνατεῖ δέ σοι οὐδέν. Τίς γάρ ἐστιν ὁ κρύπτων σε βου- 3
λήν, φειδόμενος δὲ ῥημάτων, καὶ σὲ οἴεται κρύπτειν; Ἀνηγγέλῃ
δέ μοι ἃ οὐκ ᾔδειν, μεγάλα καὶ θαυμαστά, ἃ οὐκ ἠπιστάμην.
Ἄκουσον δὴ μου Κύριε, ἵνα κἀγὼ λαλήσω· ἐρωτήσω δέ σε, σὺ δὲ 4
με δίδαξον. Ἀκοὴ μὲν ὠτὸς (ἀκοῆς) ἤκουόν σου τοπρότερον, νυνὶ 5
δὲ ὁ ὀφθαλμός μου ἑώρακέ σε· διὸ ἐφαύλισα ἐμαυτόν, καὶ ἐτάχην, 6
ἤγημαι δὲ ἐμαυτόν γῆν καὶ σποδόν. Ἐγένετο δὲ μετὰ τὸ λαλή- 7

## CHAPTER XLI.

**6** Around his teeth is terror. And his belly [is of] brazen shields, and his bond is as an emery stone.
**7** One cleaveth to another, and breath shall not pass through him.
**8** A man shall cleave unto his brother; they are held fast together, and they shall not be torn asunder.
**9** At his sneeze a light doth shine forth; and his eyes are like unto the morning star.
**10** Out of his mouth issue burning torches, and sparks of fire are scattered abroad.
**11** Out of his nostrils issueth smoke as from a furnace burning with fire of coals;
**12** His breath [is] coals, and a flame issueth from his mouth.
**13** And in his neck doth power lodge; before him runneth destruction.
**14** The flesh of his body is joined fast; though [one] poureth [blows] upon him, he shall not be shaken.
**15** His heart is hardened as a stone, and he hath set it as an immovable anvil.
**16** When he turneth, there is terror to the four-footed beasts leaping upon the earth.
**17** If spears should meet him, they shall do naught to him; [nor] a lifted spear, nor a breastplate.
**18** For he counteth iron as chaff, and bronze as rotten wood.
**19** A brazen bow shall not wound him; for he counteth the stone-thrower as grass, and a hammer is reckoned unto him as stubble. And he laugheth at a fiery shock.
**21** His bed [is of] sharp pointed stakes, and all the gold of the sea beneath him [is] as immeasurable mud.
**22** He maketh the abyss to boil up as a coppersmith’s forge; and he deemeth the sea as an unguent,
**23** and the Tartarus of the abyss as a captive; he hath considered the abyss for a walk.
**24** There is nothing upon earth like unto him, made to be mocked by My angels.
**25** Every high thing he doth behold, and he himself is king of all those in the waters.

## CHAPTER XLII.

**1-2** Then Job answered the Lord and said: I know that Thou art able [to do] all things, and nothing is impossible for Thee.
**3** For who is he that hideth Thy counsel, and spareth [his] words, and imagineth to hide [aught from] Thee? It was declared unto me that which I knew not, great and wonderful things, which I understood not.
**4** Hearken now unto me, O Lord, that I also may speak; I will question Thee, and do Thou teach me.
**5** By the hearing of the ear (of hearing) did I hear of Thee heretofore, but now mine eye hath seen Thee.
**6** Wherefore I have condemned myself, and am melted [away], and have esteemed myself [as] earth and ashes.
**7** And it came to pass after the Lord had spoken all these words unto Job...
