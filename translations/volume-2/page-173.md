**19** καὶ πᾶν στόμα ὃ οὐ προσεκύνησεν αὐτῷ. Καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ἐκεῖθεν,
καὶ εὑρίσκει τὸν Ἑλισσαῖε υἱὸν Σαφάτ, καὶ αὐτὸς ἠροτρία ἐν βουσῖ· δώδεκα ζεύγη βοῶν ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ, καὶ αὐτὸς ἐν τοῖς δώδεκα·
καὶ ἀπῆλθεν (Ἑλισσαῖε) ἐπ᾿ αὐτόν, καὶ ἐπέρριψε τὴν μηλωτὴν αὐτοῦ ἐπ᾿ αὐτόν. Καὶ κατέλιπεν Ἑλισσαῖε τὰς βόας, καὶ ἔπεδραμεν
**20** ὀπίσω Ἠλιοῦ, καὶ εἶπε· καταφιλήσω τὸν πατέρα μου, καὶ τὴν
μητέρα μου, καὶ ἀκολουθήσω ὀπίσω σου. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· πορεύου,
ἀνάστρεφε, ὅτι πεποίηκά σοι. Καὶ ἀνέστρεψεν ἐξ ὄπισθεν αὐτοῦ·
καὶ ἔλαβε τὰ ζεύγη τῶν βοῶν, καὶ ἔθυσε, καὶ ἐν τοῖς σκεύεσι
**21** τῶν βοῶν ἥψησεν αὐτά, καὶ ἔδωκε τῷ λαῷ, καὶ ἔφαγον· καὶ ἀνέστη, καὶ ἐπορεύθη ὀπίσω Ἠλιοῦ, καὶ ἐλειτούργει αὐτῷ.

ΚΑὶ ὁ υἱὸς Ἄδερ βασιλεὺς Συρίας συνήθροισε πᾶσαν τὴν δύ-
**1** ναμιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀνέβη, καὶ περιεκάθισεν ἐπὶ Σαμάρειαν, καὶ τρι
ακονταδύο βασιλεῖς μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ πᾶς ἵππος, καὶ ἅρμα· καὶ ἀνέβησαν, καὶ περιεκάθισαν ἐπὶ Σαμάρειαν, καὶ ἐπολέμησαν ἐπ᾿ αὐτήν. Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ἀγγέλους πρὸς Ἀχαὰβ βασιλέα Ἰσραὴλ εἰς
**2** τὴν πόλιν, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτόν· τάδε λέγει ὁ υἱὸς Ἄδερ· τὸ ἀρ
γύριόν σου, καὶ τὸ χρυσίον σου ἐμόν ἐστι, καὶ αἱ γυναῖκές σου,
**3** καὶ τὰ τέκνα σου τὰ καλὰ ἐμά ἐστι. Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη ὁ βασιλεὺς
**4** Ἰσραήλ, καὶ εἶπε· καθὼς ἐλάλησάς (μοι) κύριέ μου βασιλεῦ, σός
εἰμι ἐγώ, καὶ πάντα τὰ ἐμά. Καὶ ἀνέστρεψαν οἱ ἄγγελοι, καὶ
**5** εἶπαν (πρὸς αὐτόν)· τάδε λέγει ὁ υἱὸς Ἄδερ· ἐγὼ ἀπέστρεψα πρὸς
σέ, λέγων· τὸ ἀργύριόν σου, καὶ τὸ χρυσίον σου, καὶ τὰς γυναῖκάς σου, καὶ τὰ τέκνα σου ἐμοὶ δώσεις· ὅτι ταύτην τὴν ὥραν αὐ
**6** ρίον ἀποστελῶ τὰς παῖδάς μου πρὸς σέ, καὶ ἐρευνήσουσι τὸν οἶκόν σου, καὶ τοὺς οἴκους τῶν παίδων σου, καὶ ἔσται πάντα τὰ ἐπιθυμητὰ ὀφθαλμῶν αὐτῶν ἐφ᾿ ἃ ἂν ἐπιβάλωσι τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν,
καὶ λήψονται. Καὶ ἐκάλεσεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ πάντας τοὺς πρε
**7** σβυτέρους τῆς γῆς, καὶ εἶπε· γνῶτε δή, καὶ ἴδετε ὅτι κακίαν οὗ
τος ζητεῖ, ὅτι ἀπέσταλκε πρὸς μὲ περὶ τῶν γυναικῶν μου, καὶ
περὶ τῶν υἱῶν μου, καὶ περὶ τῶν θυγατέρων μου· τὸ χρυσίον μου,
καὶ τὸ ἀργύριόν μου, οὐκ ἀπεκώλυσα ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπαν αὐ

**Chapter 19**
**19** and every mouth which hath not kissed him. And he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was ploughing with oxen; twelve yoke of oxen were before him, and he himself was with the twelfth. And he went unto him, (even Elisha,) and cast his mantle upon him.
**20** And Elisha left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, "Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee." And he said unto him, "Go, turn back again: for what have I done unto thee?"
**21** And he returned from following him, and took the yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the implements of the oxen, and gave thereof unto the people, and they did eat. And he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him.

**Chapter 20**
**1** And Ben-Hadad, the king of Syria, gathered all his host together: and he went up, and besieged Samaria, and thirty and two kings were with him, and horses, and chariots. And they went up, and besieged Samaria, and fought against it.
**2** And he sent messengers to Ahab, king of Israel, into the city, and said unto him, "Thus saith Ben-Hadad: Thy silver, and thy gold, is mine;
**3** thy wives also, and thy fairest children, are mine."
**4** And the king of Israel answered and said, "My lord, O king, according as thou hast spoken (unto me), I am thine, and all that I have."
**5** And the messengers came again, and said (unto him), "Thus speaketh Ben-Hadad, saying, 'I sent indeed unto thee, saying: Thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children;'
**6** for by this hour tomorrow I will send my servants unto thee, and they shall search thine house, and the houses of thy servants; and whatsoever is pleasant in their eyes, upon that shall they lay their hands, and take it away."
**7** Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, "Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief: for he did send unto me for my wives, and for my sons, and for my daughters; my gold, and my silver, I did not withhold from him."
**8** And all the elders and all the people said unto him, "Hearken not unto him, nor consent—"
