λῃ Δαυὶδ ἀνθρώπου τοῦ Θεοῦ, ἐφημερίαν πρὸς ἐφημερίαν.
Ἐν τῷ συναγαγεῖν με τοὺς πυλωρούς, ἐν ἡμέραις Ἰωακεὶμ υἱοῦ Ἰησοῦ, υἱοῦ Ἰωσεδέκ. καὶ ἐν ἡμέραις Νεεμία, καὶ Ἔζρα, ὁ ἱερεὺς καὶ ὁ γραμματεύς.
Καὶ ἐν ἐγκαινίοις τείχους Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐζήτησαν τοὺς Λευίτας ἐν τοῖς τόποις αὐτῶν τοῦ ἐνέγκαι αὐτοὺς εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ, ποιῆσαι ἐγκαίνια καὶ εὐφροσύνην ἐν θωδαθὰ, καὶ ἐν ᾠδαῖς κυμβαλίζοντες, καὶ ψαλτήρια, καὶ κινύραι.
Καὶ συνήχθησαν οἱ υἱοὶ τῶν ᾀδόντων καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς περιχώρου κυκλόθεν εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἀπὸ ἐπαύλεων, καὶ ἀπὸ ἀγρῶν,
ὅτι ἐπαύλεις ᾠκοδόμησαν ἑαυτοῖς οἱ ᾄδοντες ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ.
Καὶ ἐκαθαρίσθησαν οἱ ἱερεῖς καὶ οἱ Λευῖται, καὶ ἐκαθάρισαν τὸν λαὸν καὶ τοὺς πυλωροὺς καὶ τὸ τεῖχος.
Καὶ ἀνήνεγκα τοὺς ἄρχοντας Ἰούδα ἐπάνω τοῦ τείχους, καὶ ἔστησα δύο περὶ αἰνέσεως μεγάλους, καὶ διῆλθον ἐκ δεξιῶν ἐπάνω τοῦ τείχους τῆς κοπρίας.
Καὶ ἐπορεύθη ὀπίσω αὐτῶν Ὠσαία καὶ ἡμίσυ ἀρχόντων Ἰούδα,
καὶ Ἀζαρίας, καὶ Ἔζρα, καὶ Μεσολλὰμ,
Ἰούδα, καὶ Βενιαμείν, καὶ Σαμαία, καὶ Ἱερεμίας,
καὶ ἀπὸ υἱῶν τῶν ἱερέων ἐν σάλπιγξι, Ζαχαρίας υἱὸς Ἰωνάθαν, υἱὸς Σαμαία, υἱὸς Μαθθανία, υἱὸς Μιχαία, υἱὸς Ζαχχούρ, υἱὸς Ἀσάφ.
Καὶ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ, Σαμαία, καὶ Ὀζιὴλ, Γελὼλ, Ἰαμὰ, Ἄϊα, Ναθαναὴλ, καὶ Ἰούδα, Ἀνανὶ, τοῦ αἰνεῖν ἐν ᾠδαῖς Δαυὶδ ἀνθρώπου τοῦ Θεοῦ.
καὶ Ἔζρας ὁ γραμματεὺς ἔμπροσθεν αὐτῶν ἐπὶ πύλης, τοῦ αἰνεῖν κατέναντι αὐτῶν. καὶ ἀνέβησαν ἐπὶ κλίμακας πόλεως Δαυὶδ ἐν ἀναβάσει τοῦ τείχους ἐπάνωθεν τοῦ οἴκου Δαυὶδ καὶ ἕως πύλης τοῦ ὕδατος Ἐφραΐμ,
καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν πύλην ἰχθυηρὰν, καὶ πύργου Ἀναμεὴλ, καὶ ἕως πύλης τῆς προβατικῆς.
Καὶ ἠκούσθησαν οἱ ἄδοντες, καὶ ἐπεσκέπησαν·
Καὶ ἔθυσαν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ θυσιάσματα μεγάλα, καὶ ηὐφράνθησαν, ὅτι ὁ Θεὸς ηὔφρανεν αὐτοὺς μεγάλως. καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ τέκνα αὐτῶν ηὐφράνθησαν, καὶ ἠκούσθη εὐφροσύνη ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἀπὸ μακρόθεν.
Καὶ κατέστησαν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἄνδρας ἐπὶ τῶν γαζοφυλακίων, τοῖς θησαυροῖς, ταῖς ἀπαρχαῖς, καὶ ταῖς δεκάταις, καὶ τοῖς συνηγμένοις ἐν αὐτοῖς ἄρχουσι τῶν πόλεων μερίδας τοῖς ἱερεῦσι καὶ τοῖς Λευίταις, ὅτι εὐφροσύνη ἦν ἐν Ἰούδᾳ καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς ἱερεῖς, καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς Λευίτας τοὺς ἑστῶτας.
Καὶ ἐφύλαξαν φυλακὰς Θεοῦ ἑαυτῶν, καὶ φυλακὰς τοῦ καθαρισμοῦ, καὶ τοὺς ᾄδοντας, καὶ τοὺς πυλωροὺς, ὡς ἐντολαὶ Δαυὶδ, καὶ Σαλωμὼν υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ.
Ὅτι ἐν ἡμέραις Δαυὶδ Ἀσὰφ ἀπ᾿ ἀρχῆς πρῶτος τῶν ἀδόντων καὶ ὕμνον καὶ αἴνεσιν τῷ Θεῷ.

#### NEHEMIAH CHAPTER 12

...for David, the man of God, course after course.

<sup>25</sup> In the days when I gathered the gatekeepers, [even] in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah, and Ezra, the priest and the scribe.
<sup>27</sup> And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, they sought the Levites out of all their places, that they might bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with rejoicing and with thanksgivings, and with songs, playing on cymbals, and psalteries, and lyres.
<sup>28</sup> And the sons of the singers were gathered, both from the region round about Jerusalem, and from the villages, and from the fields;
<sup>29</sup> for the singers had built themselves villages in Jerusalem.
<sup>30</sup> And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and they purified the people, and the gatekeepers, and the wall.
<sup>31</sup> And I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and I set two great companies for thanksgiving, and they went forth from the right side upon the wall, even unto the Dung Gate.
<sup>32</sup> And after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah,
<sup>33</sup> and Azariah, and Ezra, and Meshullam,
<sup>34</sup> Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah;
<sup>35</sup> and of the sons of the priests with trumpets: Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph.
<sup>36</sup> And his brethren: Shemaiah, and Uzziel, Gelul, Jama, Aiah, Nethanel, and Judah, Hanani, who were to praise with the songs of David, the man of God.
<sup>37</sup> And Ezra the scribe went before them upon the gate, to praise before them. And they went up by the stairs of the City of David, by the ascent of the wall above the House of David, and even unto the Water Gate of Ephraim;
<sup>39</sup> and upon the Fish Gate, and the Tower of Hananeel, and even unto the Sheep Gate.
<sup>42</sup> And the singers were heard, and they were sheltered.
<sup>43</sup> And they offered great sacrifices on that day, and rejoiced; for God had made them rejoice with great joy. And their wives also and their children rejoiced; and the joy of Jerusalem was heard afar off.
<sup>44</sup> And on that day, men were appointed over the treasuries, for the stores, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes, and for those gathered therein as rulers of the cities, to give portions unto the priests and unto the Levites; for there was great joy in Judah, and among the priests, and among the Levites who stood in service.
<sup>45</sup> And they kept their own duties before God, and the duties of purification, and [the duties of] the singers, and the gatekeepers, according to the commandments of David and Solomon his son.
<sup>46</sup> For in the days of David, Asaph, from the beginning, was the chief of the singers, and [he established] hymn and praise unto God.
