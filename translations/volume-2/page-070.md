ΚΕΦ. Β΄. ΙΙ.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο μετὰ ταῦτα καὶ ἐπηρώτησε Δαυὶδ ἐν Κυρίῳ, λέγων· εἰ ἀναβῶ εἰς μίαν τῶν πόλεων Ἰούδα; καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς αὐτόν· ἀνάβηθι· καὶ εἶπε Δαυὶδ· ποῦ ἀναβῶ; καὶ εἶπεν·
2 εἰς Χεβρών. Καὶ ἀνέβη ἐκεῖ Δαυίδ, καὶ ἀμφότεραι αἱ γυναῖκες αὐτοῦ, Ἀχινάαμ ἡ Ἰζραηλῖτις, καὶ Ἀβιγαία ἡ γυνὴ Νάβαλ τοῦ
3 Καρμηλίτου. Καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες αὐτοῦ οἱ μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ, οὗ ἐὰν ἤγαγε Δαυίδ, ἕκαστος καὶ ὁ οἶκος αὐτοῦ, καὶ κατῴκουν ἐν ταῖς πόλεσι Χεβρών.
4 Καὶ ἔρχονται ἄνδρες τῆς Ἰουδαίας, καὶ χρίουσιν ἐκεῖ τὸν Δαυὶδ ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον Ἰούδα τοῦ βασιλεύειν ἐπ᾽ αὐτούς· καὶ ἀπήγγειλαν τῷ Δαυίδ, λέγοντες· ὅτι οἱ ἄνδρες Ἰαβεὶς τῆς
5 Γαλααδίτιδος ἔθαψαν τὸν Σαούλ. Καὶ ἀπέστειλε Δαυὶδ ἀγγέλους πρὸς τοὺς ἡγουμένους Ἰαβεὶς τῆς Γαλααδίτιδος, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτούς· εὐλογημένοι ὑμεῖς τῷ Κυρίῳ, ὅτι πεποιήκατε τὸ ἔλεος
6 τοῦτο εἰς τὸν κύριον ὑμῶν, εἰς Σαούλ, καὶ ἐθάψατε αὐτόν. Καὶ νῦν ποιῆσαι Κύριος μεθ᾽ ὑμῶν ἔλεος καὶ ἀλήθειαν, καί γε ἐγὼ ποιήσω μεθ᾽ ὑμῶν τὸ ἀγαθὸν τοῦτο, ὅτι ἐποιήσατε τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο.
7 Καὶ νῦν κραταιούσθωσαν αἱ χεῖρες ὑμῶν, καὶ γίνεσθε εἰς υἱοὺς δυνατούς, ὅτι τέθνηκεν ὁ κύριος ὑμῶν Σαούλ, καί γε ἐμὲ κέ-χρικεν ὁ οἶκος Ἰούδα εἰς βασιλέα ἐφ᾽ ἑαυτούς.
8 Καὶ Ἀβεννὴρ υἱὸς Νὴρ ἀρχιστράτηγος τοῦ Σαούλ ἔλαβε τὸν Ἰσβοσθὲ υἱὸν Σαούλ,
9 καὶ ἀνεβίβασεν αὐτὸν ἐκ τῆς παρεμβολῆς, καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὴν Γαλααδῖτιν, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν Θασουρί, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν Ἰεζραήλ, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν Ἐφραίμ, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν Βενιαμείν, καὶ ἐπὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἅπαντα.
10 Τεσσαράκοντα ἐτῶν Ἰσβοσθὲ υἱὸς Σαούλ, ὅτε ἐβασίλευσεν ἐπὶ τὸν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ δύο ἔτη ἐβασίλευσε, πλὴν τοῦ οἴκου Ἰούδα, οἳ ἦσαν ὀπίσω Δαυίδ.
11 Καὶ ἐγένοντο αἱ ἡμέραι ἃς Δαυὶδ ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Χεβρὼν ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον Ἰούδα, ἑπτὰ ἔτη καὶ ἓξ μῆνας.
12 Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Ἀβεννὴρ υἱὸς Νήρ, καὶ οἱ παῖδες Ἰσβοσθὲ υἱοῦ Σαούλ ἐκ Μαναεὶμ εἰς Γαβαών.
13 Καὶ Ἰωὰβ υἱὸς Σαρουία, καὶ οἱ παῖδες Δαυὶδ ἐξήλθοσαν ἐκ Χεβρὼν, καὶ συναντῶσιν αὐτοῖς ἐπὶ τὴν κρήνην τὴν (ἐν) Γαβαὼν ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό, καὶ ἐκάθισαν αὐτοὶ ἐπὶ τὴν κρήνην ἐντεῦθεν,
14 καὶ οὗτοι ἐπὶ τὴν κρήνην ἐντεῦθεν. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἀβεννὴρ πρὸς Ἰωάβ· ἀναστήτωσαν δὴ τὰ παιδάρια, καὶ

**1** And it came to pass after this, that David inquired of the Lord, saying, "Shall I go up into one of the cities of Judah?" And the Lord said unto him, "Go up." And David said, "Whither shall I go up?" And He said, "Unto Hebron."
**2** So David went up thither, and both his wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
**3** And his men that were with him, whomsoever David had brought, each one with his household, they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.
**4** Then came the men of Judah, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, "The men of Jabesh Gilead have buried Saul."
**5** And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh Gilead, and said unto them, "Blessed be ye of the Lord, that ye have shown this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him.
**6** And now may the Lord show you mercy and truth; and I also will requite you this good, because ye have done this thing.
**7** Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant men; for your lord Saul is dead, and the house of Judah hath also anointed me king over them."
**8** But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ishbosheth the son of Saul,
**9** and brought him over from the camp, and made him king over Gilead, and over Asher, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.
**10** Ishbosheth, Saul's son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.
**11** And the days that David reigned in Hebron over the house of Judah were seven years and six months.
**12** And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
**13** And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out from Hebron, and met them together at the well (which is) in Gibeon. And they sat down, these on one side of the well,
**14** and those on the other side of the well. And Abner said to Joab, "Let the young men now arise, and [play before us]."
