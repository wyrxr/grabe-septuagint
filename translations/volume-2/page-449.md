7 βίαιον τὸ βέλος μου ἄνευ ἀδικίας. Τίς ἀνὴρ ὥσπερ Ἰώβ, πί-
  νων μυκτηρισμὸν ὥσπερ ὕδωρ;
8 Οὐχ ἁμαρτὼν, οὐδὲ ἀσεβήσας, οὐδὲ κοινωνήσας ὁδοῦ μετὰ τῶν ποιοῦντων τὰ ἄνομα, τοῦ πο-
  ρευθῆναι μετὰ ἀνδρῶν ἀσεβῶν.
9 Μὴ γὰρ εἴπῃς, ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν ἐπισκοπὴ ἀνδρός· καὶ ἐπισκοπὴ αὐτοῦ παρὰ Κυρίῳ.
10 Διὸ συνετοὶ καρδίᾳ, ἀκούσατέ μου· μὴ μοι εἴη ἔναντι Κυρίου ἀσεβῆσαι, ἔναντι δὲ παντοκράτορος ταράξαι τὸ δίκαιον·
11 ἀλλὰ γὰρ ἀποδίδωσιν ἀνθρώπῳ καθ᾿ ἃ ποιεῖ ἕκαστος αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐν τρίβῳ ἀνδρὸς εὑρήσει αὐτόν.
12 Οἴῃ δὲ τὸν Κύριον τὰ ἄτοπα ποιήσειν; ἢ ὁ παντοκράτωρ ταράξει τὸ δίκαιον;
13 Ὁς ἐποίησε τὴν γῆν; τίς δέ ἐστιν ὁ ποιήσας τὴν ὑπ᾿ οὐρανὸν, καὶ τὰ ἐνόντα πάντα;
14 Εἰ γὰρ βούλοιτο συνέχειν, καὶ τὸ πνεῦμα παρ᾿ αὐτῷ κατασχεῖν,
15 τελευτήσει πᾶσα σὰρξ ὁμοθυμαδὸν, βροτὸς δὲ εἰς γῆν ἀπελεύσεται ὅθεν καὶ ἐπλάσθη.
16 Εἰ δὲ μὴ νουθετῇ, ἄκουε ταῦτα (Ἰὼβ), ἐνωτίζου φωνὴν ῥημάτων.
17 Εἰ δὲ σὺ οὐκ οἴει τὸν μισοῦντα τὰ ἄνομα καὶ τὸν ὀλλύντα τοὺς πονηροὺς, **ἔστιν** αἰώνιον καὶ δίκαιον;
18 Ἀσεβὴς ὁ λέγων βασιλεῖ, παρανομεῖς, ἀσεβέστατε, τοῖς ἄρχουσιν·
19 ὃς οὐκ αἰσχυνθῇ πρόσωπον ἐντίμων, οὐδὲ οἶδεν τιμὴν θέσθαι ἀδροῖς, τοῦ θαυμασθῆναι τὰ πρόσωπα αὐτῶν.
20 Κενὰ δὲ αὐτοῖς ἀποθήσεται τῷ κεκραγέναι καὶ δεῖσθαι ἀνδρός· ἐχρήσαντο γὰρ παρανόμως, ἐκκλειομένων ἀδυνάτων.
21 Αὐτὸς γὰρ ὁρατὴς ἐστιν ἔργων ἀνθρώπων, λέληθε δὲ αὐτὸν οὐδὲν ὧν πράσσουσιν·
22 οὐδὲ **ἔστι** τόπος οὐδὲ σκιὰ θανάτου, τοῦ κρυβῆναι τοὺς ποιοῦντας τὰ ἄνομα·
23 ὅτι οὐκ ἐπ᾿ ἄνδρα θήσει ἔτι.
24 Ὁ γὰρ Κύριος τὰ πάντα ἐφορᾷ, ὃ καταλαμβάνων ἀνεξιχνίαστα, ἔνδοξά τε καὶ ἐξαίσια, ὧν οὐκ ἔστιν ἀριθμός·
25 γνωρίζων αὐτῶν τὰ ἔργα· καὶ στρέφει νύκτα, καὶ ταπεινωθήσονται.
26 Ἔσβεσε δὲ ἀσεβεῖς, καὶ δρατοὶ ἐγένοντο ἐναντίον τῶν ἐχθρῶν·
27 ὅτι ἐξέκλιναν ἐκ νόμου Θεοῦ, δικαιώματα δὲ αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἐπέγνωσαν·
28 τοῦ ἐπαγαγεῖν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν κραυγὴν πένητος, καὶ κραυγὴν πτωχῶν εἰσακούσεται.
29 Καὶ αὐτὸς ἡσυχίαν παρέξει, καὶ τίς καταδικάσεται; καὶ κρύψει πρόσωπον, καὶ τίς ὄψεται αὐτόν;
30 καὶ κατὰ ἔθνους καὶ κατὰ ἀνθρώπου ὁμοῦ, βασιλεύων ἄνθρωπον ὑποκριτὴν ἀπὸ δυσκολίας λαοῦ.
31 Ὅτι πρὸς τὸν ἰσχυρὸν ὁ λέγων· εἴληφα, οὐκ ἐνεχυράσω· ἄνευ ἐμαυτοῦ ὄψομαι, σὺ δίδαξόν με· εἰ ἀδικίαν ἠργασάμην,
32 οὐ μὴ προσθῶ. Μὴ παρὰ σοῦ ἀποτίσει αὐτὴν, ὅτι ἀπώσω;
33 ὅτι σὺ ἐκλέξῃ καὶ οὐκ ἐγὼ, καὶ τί ἔγνως, λάλησον.
34 Διὸ συνετοὶ καρδίᾳ ἐροῦσι ταῦτα, ἀνὴρ δὲ φρόνιμος ἀκήκοέ μου τὸ ῥῆμα.
35 Ἰὼβ οὐκ ἐν συνέσει ἐλάλησε, τὰ δὲ ῥήματα αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἐν ἐπιστήμῃ.
36 Οὐ μὴν δὲ ἀλλὰ μάθε Ἰὼβ, μὴ δῶς ἔτι ἀπόκρισιν ὥσπερ οἱ ἄφρονες·
37 ἵνα μὴ προσθῶμεν ἐφ᾿ ἁμαρτίαις ἡμῶν ἀνομία δὲ ἐφ᾿ ἡμῖν λογισθήσεται, πολλὰ λαλοῦσι ῥήματα ἐναντι Κυρίου.

## CHAPTER XXXIV.

**7** My arrow is violent without injustice. What man is like Job,
    who drinketh up scorn like water?
**8** He hath not sinned, neither wrought impiety, neither hath he shared a path
    with them that work lawlessness, that he might walk with ungodly men.
**9** For say not, that 'there is no oversight of man,' for his oversight is with the Lord.
**10** Therefore, ye wise of heart, hearken unto me: Far be it from me to be ungodly before the Lord,
    and before the Almighty to pervert that which is just;
**11** but indeed, He rendereth unto man according to what each of them doth,
    and in the path of a man shall He find him.
**12** Deemest thou that the Lord will do evil? Or will the Almighty pervert justice?
**13** Who made the earth? And who is He that made that which is under heaven, and all things therein?
**14** For if He would gather [all life] unto Himself, and hold back His spirit with Him,
**15** all flesh shall perish together, and mortal man shall return to the earth whence he was formed.
**16** If thou be not chastened thereby, hear these things, O Job; give ear unto the voice of [my] words.
**17** And if thou dost not believe that He who hateth lawless deeds and destroyeth the wicked,
    is eternal and righteous?
**18** Ungodly is he who saith unto a king, 'Thou transgressest the law,'
    or unto rulers, 'Thou most impious one!'
**19** He who respecteth not the person of those in honour, neither knoweth how to give honour
    to the powerful, such that their faces should be admired.
**20** But vain things shall be laid up for them by reason of their crying out and seeking aid from man;
    for they have used [their power] lawlessly, while the weak were shut out.
**21** For He Himself is the Observer of the works of men, and naught of that which they do is hidden from Him.
**22** Neither is there any place nor shadow of death, for them that work lawlessness to hide themselves;
**23** for He shall no more lay [judgment] upon man.
**24** For the Lord doth behold all things, He who graspeth things untraceable,
    both glorious and wondrous, of which there is no number;
**25** knowing their works; and He turneth [their] night [upon them], and they shall be humbled.
**26** And He hath quenched the ungodly, and they were made manifest before their foes;
**27** because they turned aside from the Law of God, and His ordinances they did not acknowledge;
**28** so that the cry of the poor might reach Him, and the cry of the needy He shall hear.
**29** And if He Himself granteth quietness, who then shall condemn?
    And if He hideth His face, who then shall behold Him?
**30** [He ruleth] both over a nation and over a man alike, reigning, [He removes] the hypocritical man
    from the affliction of the people.
**31** For [it is] to the Mighty One that one should say: 'I have borne [my punishment];
    Thou didst not exact a pledge. That which I discern not myself, I shall perceive; do Thou teach me.
    If I have wrought injustice,
**32** I shall not add [to it again].' Shall He repay it from thee, because thou hast rejected [Him]?
**33** For thou shalt choose, and not I. Therefore, what thou knowest, speak.
**34** Therefore, ye wise of heart, shall speak thus: 'A man of understanding hath heard my word.
**35** Job hath not spoken with wisdom, and his words are not with knowledge.'
**36** Nay, but learn, O Job, give no more answer as do the foolish;
**37** lest we add iniquity unto our sins, and lawlessness be accounted unto us,
    who speak many words before the Lord."
