πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ, καὶ εὐλόγησε τὴν πᾶσαν ἐκκλησίαν Ἰσραήλ· καὶ
πᾶσα ἡ ἐκκλησία Ἰσραὴλ παρειστήκει, καὶ εἶπεν· εὐλογητὸς Κύ- 4
ριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ, ὡς ἐλάλησεν ἐν στόματι αὐτοῦ πρὸς Δαυΐδ τὸν
πατέρα μου, καὶ ἐν χερσὶν αὐτοῦ ἐπλήρωσε, λέγων· ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέ- 5
ρας ἧς ἀνήγαγον τὸν λαόν μου ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, οὐκ ἐξελεξάμην
ἐν πόλει ἀπὸ πασῶν φυλῶν Ἰσραήλ, τοῦ οἰκοδομῆσαι οἶκον, τοῦ
εἶναι ὄνομά μου ἐκεῖ, καὶ οὐκ ἐξελεξάμην ἐν ἀνδρί, τοῦ εἶναι εἰς
ἡγούμενον ἐπὶ τὸν λαόν μου Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἐξελεξάμην ἐν Ἱερουσα- 6
λὴμ γενέσθαι (τοῦ εἶναι) τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐκεῖ, καὶ ἐξελεξάμην ἐν
Δαυΐδ ὥστε εἶναι ἐπὶ τοῦ λαοῦ μου Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐπὶ καρ- 7
δίαν Δαυΐδ τοῦ πατρός μου, τοῦ οἰκοδομῆσαι οἶκον τῷ ὀνόματι
Κυρίου Θεοῦ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Δαυΐδ τὸν πατέρα 8
μου· διότι ἐγένετο ἐπὶ καρδίαν σου τοῦ οἰκοδομῆσαι οἶκον τῷ ὀνό-
ματί μου, καλῶς ἐποίησας, ὅτι ἐγένετο ἐπὶ τὴν καρδίαν σου. Πλὴν 9
σὺ οὐκ οἰκοδομήσεις τὸν οἶκον, ἔτι ὁ υἱός σου ὃς ἐξελεύσεται ἐκ
τῆς ὀσφύος σου, οὗτος οἰκοδομήσει τὸν οἶκον τῷ ὀνόματί μου.
Καὶ ἀνέστησε Κύριος τὸν λόγον αὐτοῦ, ὃν ἐλάλησε, καὶ ἐγενήθην 10
ἀντὶ Δαυΐδ πατρός μου, καὶ ἐκάθισα ἐπὶ τὸν θρόνον Ἰσραήλ, κα-
θὼς ἐλάλησε Κύριος· καὶ ᾠκοδόμησα τὸν οἶκον τῷ ὀνόματι Κυ-
ρίου Θεοῦ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἔθηκα ἐκεῖ τὴν κιβωτὸν ἐν ᾗ ἐκεῖ διαθήκη 11
Κυρίου, ἣν διέθετο τῷ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἔστη κατέναντι τοῦ θυσια- 12
στηρίου Κυρίου, ἔναντι πάσης ἐκκλησίας Ἰσραήλ, καὶ διεπέτασε
τὰς χεῖρας ἑαυτοῦ, ὅτι ἐποίησε Σαλωμὼν βάσιν χαλκῆν, καὶ ἔθη- 13
κεν αὐτὴν ἐν μέσω τῆς αὐλῆς τοῦ ἱεροῦ, πέντε πήχεων τὸ μῆκος
αὐτῆς, καὶ πέντε πήχεων τὸ εὖρος αὐτῆς, καὶ τριῶν πήχεων τὸ
ὕψος αὐτῆς· καὶ ἔστη ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς, καὶ ἔπεσεν ἐπὶ τὰ γόνατα αὐτοῦ
ἔναντι πάσης ἐκκλησίας Ἰσραήλ, καὶ διεπέτασε τὰς χεῖρας αὑ-
τοῦ εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν, καὶ εἶπε· Κύριε ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ, οὐκ ἔστιν 14
ὅμοιός σοι Θεὸς ἐν οὐρανῷ καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, φυλάσσων τὴν διαθή-
κην καὶ τὸ ἔλεος τοῖς παισί σου τοῖς πορευομένοις ἐναντίον σου ἐν
ὅλῃ καρδίᾳ, ἃ ἐφύλαξας τῷ παιδί σου Δαυΐδ τῷ πατρί μου, ἃ ἐλά- 15
λησας αὐτῷ λέγων, καὶ ἐλάλησας ἐν τῷ στόματί σου, καὶ ἐν χει-
ρί σου ἐπλήρωσας, ὡς ἡ ἡμέρα αὕτη· καὶ νῦν, Κύριε ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσ- 16
ραήλ, φύλαξον τῷ παιδί σου τῷ Δαυΐδ τῷ πατρί μου, ἃ ἐλάλησας
αὐτῷ, λέγων· οὐκ ἐκλείψει σοι ἀνὴρ ἀπὸ προσώπου μου καθήμε-
νος ἐπὶ θρόνου Ἰσραήλ, πλὴν ἐὰν φυλάξωσιν οἱ υἱοί σου τὴν ὁδὸν

**CHAPTER 6**

And the king turned his face, and blessed all the congregation of Israel; and all the congregation of Israel stood by.
⁴ And he said, "Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, Who spake with His mouth unto David my father, and with His hands hath fulfilled [it], saying:
⁵ 'From the day that I brought My people forth out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house, that My Name might be there; neither chose I any man to be a ruler over My people Israel.
⁶ But I chose Jerusalem, that My Name should be established there (even to be); and I chose David to be over My people Israel.
⁷ And it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the Name of the Lord God of Israel.
⁸ And the Lord said unto David my father, "Forasmuch as it was in thine heart to build a house for My Name, thou didst well that it was in thine heart.
⁹ Nevertheless, thou shalt not build the house; but thy son who shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for My Name."
¹⁰ And the Lord hath performed His word which He spake; for I am risen up in the stead of David my father, and have sat upon the throne of Israel, as the Lord spake.
¹¹ And I have built the house for the Name of the Lord God of Israel, and there have I put the Ark, wherein is the covenant of the Lord, which He made with Israel.'
¹² And he stood before the altar of the Lord, before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands.
¹³ (For Solomon had made a brazen platform, and set it in the midst of the court, the length thereof was five cubits, and the breadth thereof five cubits, and the height thereof three cubits; and he stood upon it, and kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven, and said:)
¹⁴ "O Lord God of Israel, there is no God like Thee in heaven nor in the earth, keeping covenant and mercy with Thy servants who walk before Thee with all their heart;
¹⁵ Thou Who hast kept unto Thy servant David my father that which Thou spakest unto him, saying, yea, Thou spakest with Thy mouth, and with Thy hand hast fulfilled [it], as it is this day.
¹⁶ Now therefore, O Lord God of Israel, keep with Thy servant David my father that which Thou hast spoken unto him, saying, 'There shall not fail thee a man from My presence to sit upon the throne of Israel, provided that thy children keep their way..."
