ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Α´. 501
ΚΕΦ. ΙΒ´. ΧΙΙ.
ΚΑΙ εἶπε Σαμουὴλ πρὸς πάντα ἄνδρα Ἰσραήλ· Ἰδοὺ ἤκουσα 1
φωνῆς ὑμῶν εἰς πάντα ὅσα εἴπατέ μοι, καὶ ἐβασίλευσα ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς
βασιλέα· καὶ νῦν ἰδοὺ ὁ βασιλεὺς διαπορεύεται ἐνώπιον ὑμῶν, καὶ 2
ἐγὼ γεγήρακα καὶ καθήσομαι, καὶ οἱ υἱοί μου ἰδοὺ ἐν ὑμῖν· κἀ-
γὼ ἰδοὺ διελήλυθα ἐνώπιον ὑμῶν ἐκ νεότητός μου καὶ ἕως τῆς ἡ-
μέρας ταύτης. Ἰδοὺ ἐγώ, ἀποκρίθητε κατ᾿ ἐμοῦ ἐνώπιον Κυρίου 3
καὶ ἐνώπιον χριστοῦ αὐτοῦ· μόσχον τίνος εἴληφα, ἢ ὄνον τίνος εἴ-
ληφα, ἢ τίνα κατεδυνάστευσα, ἢ τίνα ἐξεπίεσα, ἢ ἐκ χειρός τί-
νος εἴληφα ἐξίλασμα, ἢ ὑπόδημα; ἀποκρίθητε κατ᾿ ἐμοῦ, καὶ ἀ-
ποδώσω ὑμῖν. Καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς Σαμουήλ· οὐκ ἠδίκησας ἡμᾶς καὶ 4
οὐ κατεδυνάστευσας ἡμᾶς, καὶ οὐκ εἴληφας ἐκ χειρὸς οὐδενὸς οὐ-
δέν. Καὶ εἶπε Σαμουὴλ πρὸς τὸν λαόν· μάρτυς Κύριος ἐν ὑμῖν, καὶ 5
μάρτυς χριστὸς αὐτοῦ σήμερον ἐν ταύτῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ, ὅτι οὐχ εὑρήκατε ἐν
χειρί μου οὐδέν. Καὶ εἶπαν· μάρτυς. Καὶ εἶπε Σαμουὴλ πρὸς τὸν λαόν, 6
λέγων· μάρτυς Κύριος ὁ ποιήσας τὸν Μωσῆν καὶ τὸν ᾿Ααρών, καὶ ὁ ἀ-
ναγαγὼν τοὺς πατέρας ὑμῶν ἐξ Αἰγύπτου. Καὶ νῦν κατάστητε, 7
καὶ δικάσω ὑμᾶς ἐνώπιον Κυρίου, καὶ ἀπαγγελῶ ὑμῖν τὰς πά-
σας δικαιοσύνας Κυρίου, ἃς ἐποίησεν ἐν ὑμῖν καὶ ἐν τοῖς πατρά-
σιν ὑμῶν· ὡς εἰσῆλθεν Ἰακὼβ καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ εἰς Αἴγυπτον, 8
καὶ ἐταπείνωσεν αὐτοὺς Αἴγυπτος· καὶ ἐβόησαν οἱ πατέρες ὑμῶν
πρὸς Κύριον, καὶ ἀπέστειλε Κύριος τὸν Μωσῆν καὶ τὸν ᾿Αα-
ρών, καὶ ἐξήγαγε τοὺς πατέρας ὑμῶν ἐξ Αἰγύπτου, καὶ κατώ-
κισεν αὐτοὺς ἐν τῷ τόπῳ τούτῳ. Καὶ ἐπελάθοντο τοῦ Κυρίου Θεοῦ 9
αὐτῶν, καὶ ἀπέδοτο αὐτοὺς εἰς χεῖρας Σισάρα ἀρχιστρατήγου Ἰ-
αβεὶν βασιλέως ᾿Ασώρ, καὶ εἰς χεῖρας ἀλλοφύλων, καὶ εἰς χεῖ-
ρας βασιλέως Μωάβ, καὶ ἐπολέμησαν ἐν αὐτοῖς. Καὶ ἐβόησαν 10
πρὸς Κύριον, καὶ ἔλεγον· ἡμάρτομεν, ὅτι ἐγκαταλελοίπαμεν τὸν
Κύριον, καὶ ἐδουλεύσαμεν τοῖς Βααλεὶμ καὶ τοῖς ἄλσεσιν· καὶ
νῦν ἐξελοῦ ἡμᾶς ἐκ χειρὸς ἐχθρῶν ἡμῶν, καὶ δουλεύσομέν σοι.
Καὶ ἀπέστειλε Κύριος τὸν Ἱεροβάαλ, καὶ τὸν Βαράκ, καὶ τὸν 11
Ἰεφθάε, καὶ τὸν Σαμουήλ, καὶ ἐξείλατο ὑμᾶς ἐκ χειρὸς ἐχθρῶν
ὑμῶν τῶν κυκλόθεν, καὶ κατῳκεῖτε πεποιθότες. Καὶ ἴδετε ὅτι 12
Νάας βασιλεὺς υἱῶν ᾿Αμμὼν ἦλθεν ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς, καὶ εἴπατε· οὐχὶ,

**1 Kings, Chapter 12**

1 And Samuel said unto all Israel: "Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye have said unto me, and have set a king over you;
2 And now, behold, the king walketh before you; and I am grown old and will sit [down], and behold, my sons are among you. And behold, I have walked before you from my youth even until this day.
3 Behold, here I am: testify against me before the Lord and before His Anointed. Whose ox have I taken? Or whose ass have I taken? Or whom have I defrauded? Or whom have I oppressed? Or from whose hand have I received a bribe or a shoe? Answer against me, and I will restore it unto you."
4 And they said unto Samuel, "Thou hast not wronged us, nor hast thou oppressed us, neither hast thou taken anything from the hand of any man."
5 And Samuel said unto the people, "The Lord is witness among you, and His Anointed is witness this day, that ye have found naught in my hand." And they said, "He is witness."
6 Then Samuel said unto the people, saying, "The Lord is witness, even He that made Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers forth out of Egypt.
7 Now therefore, stand still, that I may plead with you before the Lord, and declare unto you all the righteous acts of the Lord, which He hath done among you and among your fathers:
8 When Jacob and his sons came into Egypt, and Egypt did humble them; then your fathers cried unto the Lord, and the Lord sent Moses and Aaron, and brought your fathers forth out of Egypt, and made them to dwell in this place.
9 But they forgot the Lord their God, and He sold them into the hand of Sisera, the captain of the host of Jabin, king of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab; and they fought against them.
10 And they cried unto the Lord, and said, 'We have sinned, for we have forsaken the Lord, and have served the Baalim and the groves. But now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve Thee.'
11 And the Lord sent Jerubbaal, and Barak, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelt in safety.
12 And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said, 'Nay;'"
