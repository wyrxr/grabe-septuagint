Ἔλαβε τὴν πόλιν. Καὶ ἐπορεύετο Δαυὶδ πορευόμενος καὶ μεγαλυνόμενος, καὶ Κύριος παντοκράτωρ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ οὗτοι οἱ ἄρχοντες τῶν δυνατῶν, οἳ ἦσαν τῷ Δαυίδ, οἳ κατισχύοντες μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ αὐτοῦ μετὰ παντὸς Ἰσραήλ, τοῦ βασιλεῦσαι αὐτὸν κατὰ τὸν λόγον Κυρίου ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ οὗτος ὁ ἀριθμὸς τῶν δυνατῶν τοῦ Δαυίδ· Ἰσεβαὰμ υἱὸς Ἀχαμανὶ πρωτότοκος, τῶν τριάκοντα· οὗτος ἐσπάσατο τὴν ῥομφαίαν αὐτοῦ ἅπαξ ἐπὶ τριακοσίους τραυματίας ἐν καιρῷ ἑνί. Καὶ μετ᾿ αὐτὸν Ἐλεάζαρ υἱὸς Δωδαὶ ὁ Ἀχωχί· οὗτος ἦν ἐν τοῖς τρισὶ δυνατοῖς. Οὗτος ἦν μετὰ Δαυὶδ ἐν Φασοδομίν· καὶ οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι συνήχθησαν ἐκεῖ εἰς πόλεμον, καὶ ἦν μερὶς τοῦ ἀγροῦ πλήρης κριθῶν, καὶ ὁ λαὸς ἔφυγεν ἀπὸ προσώπου ἀλλοφύλων. Καὶ ἔστη ἐν μέσῳ τῆς μερίδος, καὶ ἔσωσεν αὐτήν, καὶ ἐπάταξε τοὺς ἀλλοφύλους, καὶ ἐποίησε Κύριος σωτηρίαν μεγάλην. Καὶ κατέβησαν οἱ τρεῖς ἐκ τῶν τριάκοντα ἀρχόντων εἰς τὴν πέτραν πρὸς Δαυίδ, εἰς τὸ σπήλαιον Ὀδολλάμ, καὶ ἡ παρεμβολὴ τῶν ἀλλοφύλων παρεμβεβλήκει ἐν τῇ κοιλάδι τῶν γιγάντων. Καὶ Δαυὶδ τότε ἐν τῇ περιοχῇ, καὶ τὸ ὑπόστημα τῶν ἀλλοφύλων τότε ἐν τῇ Βηθλεέμ. Καὶ ἐπεθύμησε Δαυίδ, καὶ εἶπε· τίς ποτιεῖ με ὕδωρ ἐκ τοῦ λάκκου Βηθλεὲμ τοῦ ἐν τῇ πύλῃ; Καὶ διέρρηξαν οἱ τρεῖς τὴν παρεμβολὴν τῶν ἀλλοφύλων· καὶ ὑδρεύσαντο ὕδωρ ἐκ τοῦ λάκκου τοῦ ἐν Βηθλεέμ, ὃς ἦν ἐν τῇ πύλῃ, καὶ ἔλαβον, καὶ ἦλθον πρὸς Δαυίδ· καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησε Δαυὶδ τοῦ πιεῖν αὐτό, καὶ ἔσπεισεν αὐτὸ τῷ Κυρίῳ, καὶ εἶπεν· ἵλεώς μοι ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ ποιῆσαι τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο· εἰ αἷμα ἀνδρῶν τούτων πίομαι ἐν ψυχαῖς αὐτῶν; ὅτι ἐν ψυχαῖς αὐτῶν ἤνεγκαν αὐτό· καὶ οὐκ ἐβούλετο πιεῖν αὐτό. Ταῦτα ἐποίησαν οἱ τρεῖς δυνατοί. Καὶ Ἀβεσσαὶ ὁ ἀδελφὸς Ἰωάβ, οὗτος ἦν ἄρχων τῶν πατριῶν· οὗτος ἐσπάσατο τὴν ῥομφαίαν αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ ἑξακοσίους τραυματίας ἐν καιρῷ ἑνί, οὗτος ἦν ὀνομαστὸς ἐν τοῖς τρισίν, ἀπὸ τῶν τριῶν ὑπὲρ τοὺς δύο ἐνδόξος, καὶ ἦν αὐτὸς εἰς ἄρχοντα, καὶ ἕως τῶν τριῶν οὐκ ἤρχετο. Καὶ Βαναίας υἱὸς Ἰωδαὲ υἱὸς ἀνδρὸς δυνατοῦ, πολλὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ ὑπὲρ Καβασαήλ· οὗτος ἐπάταξε τοὺς δύο Ἀριὴλ Μωάβ, καὶ οὗτος κατέβη, καὶ ἐπάταξε τὸν λέοντα ἐν τῷ λάκκῳ ἐν ἡμέρᾳ χιόνος. Καὶ οὗτος ἐπάταξε τὸν ἄνδρα τὸν Αἰγύπτιον, ἄνδρα δρατὸν πεντάπηχον, καὶ ἐν τῇ χειρὶ τοῦ Αἰγυπτίου δόρυ ὡς ἀντίον ὑφαινόντων, καὶ κατέβη ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν Βαναίας ἐν ῥάβδῳ, καὶ

**English Translation:**

He took the city.

**9** And David went forth, growing in power and might, for the Lord Almighty was with him.

**10** Now these are the chiefs of the mighty men who were with David, who prevailed with him in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king over Israel, according to the word of the Lord.

**11** And this is the number of David’s mighty men: Ishbaam, the son of Hachmoni, the firstborn of the thirty; he once drew his sword against three hundred wounded men in a single encounter.

**12** And after him was Eleazar, the son of Dodai the Ahohite; he was among the three mighty men.

**13** He was with David in Phasodomin, when the Philistines were gathered there to battle; and there was a portion of the field full of barley, and the people fled from the presence of the Philistines.

**14** But he stood in the midst of that portion [of the field], and saved it, and smote the Philistines; and the Lord wrought a great salvation.

**15** And three of the thirty chiefs went down to the rock, unto David, to the cave of Odollam,

**16** and the camp of the Philistines was pitched in the valley of the Giants.

**17** Now David was then in the stronghold, and the Philistine garrison was then in Bethlehem.

**18** And David longed, and said, "Who shall give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate?"

**19** And the three broke through the camp of the Philistines; and they drew water from the well that is in Bethlehem, which was by the gate, and took it, and came to David. But David would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the Lord, and said,

**20** "My God forbid me to do this thing! Shall I drink the blood of these men with their lives?" For they brought it at the peril of their lives. And he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men.

**21** And Abishai, the brother of Joab, he was chief of the families; he drew his sword against six hundred wounded men in one encounter. He was renowned among the thirty,

**22** more glorious than two from the three, and he was a chief; yet he attained not to the three. And Banaiah, the son of Jehoiada, the son of a mighty man, whose many deeds were above Kabzeel: he smote the two Ariels of Moab, and he went down and smote a lion in a pit on a snowy day.

**23** And he smote the Egyptian man, an imposing man five cubits [tall]; and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's beam. And Banaiah went down to him with a staff, and
