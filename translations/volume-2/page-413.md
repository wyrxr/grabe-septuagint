889 ΕΣΘΗΡ. ΚΕΦ. Θʹ. Ιʹ.
27 γενεὰν καὶ γενεάν, καὶ πατριάν, καὶ πόλιν, καὶ χώραν. Αἱ δὲ
28 ἡμέραι αὗται τῶν Φρουραί, ἀχθήσονται τὸν ἅπαντα χρόνον, καὶ
    τὸ μνημόσυνον αὐτῶν οὐ μὴ ἐκλίπῃ ἐκ τῶν γενεῶν.
29 Καὶ ἔγραφεν ᾿Εσθὴρ ἡ βασίλισσα, θυγάτηρ ᾿Αμιναδάβ, καὶ Μαρ-
    δοχαῖος ὁ ᾿Ιουδαῖος, ὅσα ἐποίησαν, τό τε στερέωμα τῆς ἐπι-
    στολῆς τῶν Φρουραί.
30 Καὶ Μαρδοχαῖος καὶ ᾿Εσθὴρ ἡ βασίλισσα ἔστησαν ἑαυτοῖς καθ᾿
    ἑαυτῶν, καὶ τότε στήσαντες κατὰ τῆς ὑγιείας ἑαυτῶν καὶ τὴν
    βουλὴν ἑαυτῶν.
31 Καὶ ᾿Εσθὴρ λόγῳ ἔζησεν εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, καὶ ἐγράφη εἰς μνημό-
    συνον.

ΚΕΦ. Ιʹ. X.
1 Ἔγραψε δὲ ὁ βασιλεὺς τέλη ἐπὶ τὴν βασιλείαν τῆς τε γῆς καὶ
    τῆς θαλάσσης,
2 καὶ τὴν ἰσχὺν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀνδραγαθίαν, πλοῦτόν τε καὶ δόξαν τῆς
    βασιλείας αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἰδοὺ γέγραπται ἐν τῷ βιβλίῳ βασιλέων
    Περσῶν καὶ Μήδων, εἰς μνημόσυνον.
3 Ὁ γὰρ Μαρδοχαῖος διεδέχετο τὸν βασιλέα ᾿Αρταξέρξην, καὶ μέ-
    γας ἦν ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ, καὶ δεδοξασμένος ὑπὸ τῶν ᾿Ιουδαίων
    καὶ φιλούμενος, διηγεῖτο τὴν ἀγωγὴν παντὶ τῷ ἔθνει αὐτοῦ. Καὶ
    εἶπε Μαρδοχαῖος· παρὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐγένετο ταῦτα· ἐμνήσθην γὰρ
    περὶ τοῦ ἐνυπνίου οὗ εἶδον περὶ τῶν λόγων τούτων. οὐδὲ γὰρ
    παρῆλθεν ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν λόγος· ἡ μικρὰ πηγὴ ἐγένετο ποταμός, καὶ
    ἦν φῶς, καὶ ἥλιος, καὶ ὕδωρ πολύ. ᾿Εσθὴρ ἔστιν ὁ ποταμός,
    ἣν ἐγάμησεν ὁ βασιλεύς, καὶ ἐποίησε βασίλισσαν· οἱ δὲ δύο
    δράκοντες, ἐγώ εἰμι καὶ ᾿Αμάν· τὰ δὲ ἔθνη τὰ συναχθέντα
    ἀπολέσαι τὸ ὄνομα τῶν ᾿Ιουδαίων. τὸ δὲ ἔθνος τὸ ἐμόν, οὗτός
    ἐστιν ὁ ᾿Ισραήλ, οἱ **βοήσαντες** πρὸς τὸν Θεόν, καὶ σωθέντες· καὶ
    ἔσωσε Κύριος τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐρύσατο ἡμᾶς ἐκ πάντων τῶν
    κακῶν τούτων· καὶ ἐποίησεν ὁ Θεὸς τὰ σημεῖα, καὶ τὰ τέρατα τὰ
    μεγάλα, ἃ οὐ γέγονεν ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι. διὰ τοῦτο ἐποίησε κλήρους
    δύο, ἕνα τῷ λαῷ τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ ἕνα πᾶσι τοῖς ἔθνεσι· καὶ ἦλθον
    οἱ δύο κλῆροι εἰς ὥραν καὶ καιρόν, καὶ εἰς ἡμέραν κρίσεως,
    ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ καὶ πᾶσιν ἔθνεσι· καὶ ἐμνήσθη ὁ Κύριος τοῦ
    λαοῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐδικαίωσε τὴν κληρονομίαν αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἔσονται
    αὐτοῖς αἱ ἡμέραι αὗται, ἐν μηνὶ ᾿Αδὰρ τῇ τεσσαρεσκαιδεκάτῃ,
    καὶ τῇ πεντεκαιδεκάτῃ τοῦ αὐτοῦ μηνός, μετὰ συναγωγῆς καὶ
    χαρᾶς καὶ εὐφροσύνης ἐνώπιον τοῦ

### Esther

**Chapter 9**

<sup>27</sup> ...every generation, and by every family, and in every city, and in every province.
<sup>28</sup> But these days of Purim shall be observed throughout all time, and the memorial thereof shall not fail from among their generations.

<sup>29</sup> And Esther the queen, the daughter of Aminadab, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote all that they had done, and the confirmation of the epistle of Purim. <sup>30</sup> And Mordecai and Esther the queen established [these things] for themselves by their own authority; and thereafter did they establish [them] for their well-being and by their own counsel. <sup>31</sup> And Esther, by her word, lived forevermore; and it was written for a memorial.

### Chapter 10

<sup>1</sup> Now the king laid a tribute upon the kingdom, both of the land and of the sea. <sup>2</sup> And all the acts of his power and his might, and [the account of] the wealth and glory of his kingdom, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Persia and Media, for a memorial.

<sup>3</sup> For Mordecai was next unto King Artaxerxes, and was great in the kingdom, and honoured by the Jews and beloved of them; he recounted his manner of life unto all his nation. And Mordecai said: These things came to pass from God; for I remembered concerning the dream which I saw concerning these matters. For no word of them hath failed. The small spring became a river, and there was light, and a sun, and much water. Esther is the river, whom the king married, and made queen; and the two dragons, these are I and Haman; and the nations which were gathered together to destroy the name of the Jews. And my nation, this is Israel, they that cried out unto God, and were saved; and the Lord saved His people, and delivered us from all these evils; and God wrought signs, and great wonders, which have not come to pass among the nations. For this cause did He make two lots, one for the people of God, and one for all the nations; and the two lots came at an appointed hour and a time, even into a day of judgment, before God and all nations; and the Lord remembered His people, and justified His inheritance; and these days shall be unto them, in the month Adar on the fourteenth and on the fifteenth day of the same month, with assembly and joy and gladness before God...
