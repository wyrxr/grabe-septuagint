²⁷ βίου, ἐάν τε εἰς δεσμά. Εὐλογητὸς Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τῶν πατέρων
ἡμῶν, ὃς ἔδωκεν οὕτως ἐν καρδίᾳ τοῦ βασιλέως, τοῦ δοξάσαι τὸν
²⁸ οἶκον Κυρίου τὸν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἐπ’ ἐμὲ ἔκλινεν ἔλεος ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ τῶν συμβούλων αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντων τῶν
ἀρχόντων τοῦ βασιλέως, τῶν ἐπηρμένων. καὶ ἐγὼ ἐκραταιώθην
ὡς χεὶρ Κυρίου ἡ ἀγαθὴ ἐπ’ ἐμέ, καὶ συνῆξα ἀπὸ Ἰσραὴλ ἄρχοντας ἀναβῆναι μετ’ ἐμοῦ.

#### Chapter 7

²⁷ his livelihood, or unto bonds. Blessed be the Lord, the God of our fathers,
²⁸ Who hath put such [a thing] in the heart of the king, to glorify the House of the Lord which is in Jerusalem; and upon me He inclined mercy in the eyes of the king and of his counselors, and of all the king's exalted rulers. And I was strengthened, as the good hand of the Lord was upon me, and I gathered from Israel chief men to go up with me.

#### Chapter 8

¹ Now these are the chief men of their fathers' houses, the leaders who came up with me in the reign of Artaxerxes, the king of Babylon.
² Of the sons of Phinehas, Gershom; of the sons of Ithamar, Daniel; of the sons of David,
³ Attush; of the sons of Shechaniah; of the sons of Phoros, Zechariah, and with him an hundred and fifty [men] of the company.
⁴ And of the sons of Pahath-Moab, Elianah the son of Zeraiah, and with him two hundred males.
⁵ And of the sons of Zathoe, Shechaniah the son of Aziel, and with him three hundred males.
⁶ And of the sons of Adin, Obed the son of Jonathan, and with him fifty males.
⁷ And of the sons of Elam, Isaiah the son of Athaliah, and with him seventy males.
⁸ And of the sons of Shephatiah, Zebadiah the son of Michael, and with him eighty males.
⁹ And of the sons of Joab, Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him two hundred and eighteen males.
¹⁰ And of the sons of Baani, Shelomith the son of Josiphiah, and with him an hundred and sixty males.
¹¹ And of the sons of Bebai, Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with him twenty-eight males.
¹² And of the sons of Azgad, Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and with him an hundred and ten males.
¹³ And of the sons of Adonikam, the last ones; and these are their names: Eliphalat, Jehiel, and Shemaiah, and with them sixty males.
¹⁴ And of the sons of Baguai, Uthai and Zabbud, and with him seventy males.
¹⁵ And I gathered them together unto the river that cometh toward Euhi, and there we encamped three days.
¹⁶ And I understood among the people and among the priests that I found no sons of Levi there. And I sent unto Eleazar, unto Ariel, unto Shemaiah,
¹⁷ and unto Alonam, and unto Jarib, and unto Elnatham, and unto Nathan, and unto Zechariah, and unto Meshullam, and unto Joiarib, and unto Elnathan, men of understanding. And I sent them forth unto leaders in Argyrion of the place, and I put words in their mouth to speak
¹⁸ unto their brethren, the Nethinim, in Argyrion of the place, that they should bring us singers for the House of our God. And they came unto us, as the good hand of our God was upon us: a man Sachon of the sons of Mooli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel.
¹⁹ And in the beginning there came his sons and his brethren, eighteen [men]; and Hashabiah, and Isaiah of
²⁰ the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty [men]. And of the Nethinim, whom David and the princes had given for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinim, all of them were assembled by name.
²¹ And I proclaimed a fast there, by the river Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God, to seek of Him a straight way for us,
²² and for our children, and for all our possessions. For I was ashamed to ask of the king a force and horsemen to save us from the enemy in the way, for we had spoken unto the king, saying: "The hand of our God is upon all them that seek Him for good, and His strength,
²³ and His wrath is upon all them that forsake Him." So we fasted and sought [guidance] from our God concerning this, and He heard us.
²⁴ And I set apart twelve of the chief priests, even Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and with them ten of their brethren.
²⁵ And I delivered unto them the silver and the gold and the vessels, [being] the first offerings for the House of our God, which the king and his counselors and his princes had elevated, and all Israel who were found [there].
²⁶ And I delivered into their hands six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels of an hundred talents, and an hundred talents of gold.
²⁷ And twenty golden bowls for the journey, [worth] a thousand drachmas,
²⁸ and vessels of fine shining bronze, being various, and precious as gold. And I said unto them: "Ye are holy unto the Lord God, and the vessels are holy,
²⁹ and the silver and the gold are freewill offerings unto the Lord God of your fathers. Be watchful and keep them, until ye stand before the chief priests and the Levites and the chief men of the fathers' houses in Jerusalem, unto the chambers of the House of the Lord."
³⁰ And the priests and the Levites received by weight the silver and the gold and
³¹ the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the House of our God.
³² And we departed from the river Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month to go unto Jerusalem; and the hand of our God was upon us.
