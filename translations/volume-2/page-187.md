θεν εἰς τὸ ὄρος τὸ Καρμήλιον, καὶ ἐκεῖθεν ὑπέστρεψεν εἰς Σαμάρειαν.

ΚΕΦ. Γ΄. ΙΙΙ.

**1** ΚΑὶ Ἰωρὰμ υἱὸς Ἀχαὰβ ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ἰσραήλ, ἐν ἔτει ὀκτωκαιδεκάτῳ Ἰωσαφὰτ βασιλέως Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐβασίλευσε δώδεκα ἔτη.
**2** Καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ πονηρὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς Κυρίου· πλὴν οὐχ ὡς ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐχ ὡς ἡ μήτηρ αὐτοῦ· καὶ μετέστησε τὰς στήλας τοῦ Βάαλ, ἃς ἐποίησεν ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ.
**3** Πλὴν ἐν τῇ ἁμαρτίᾳ Ἱεροβοὰμ υἱοῦ Ναβάτ, ὃς ἐξήμαρτε τὸν Ἰσραήλ, ἐκολλήθη, οὐκ ἀπέσπῃ ἀπ᾿ αὐτῆς.
**4** Καὶ Μωσὰβ βασιλεὺς Μωὰβ ἦν Νωκήδ, καὶ ἐπέστρεψε τῷ βασιλεῖ Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τῇ ἐπαναστάσει ἑκατὸν χιλιάδας ἀρνῶν, καὶ ἑκατὸν χιλιάδας κριῶν ἐπὶ πόκων.
**5** Καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ τὸ ἀποθανεῖν Ἀχαάβ, καὶ ἠθέτησε βασιλεὺς Μωὰβ ἐν βασιλεῖ Ἰσραήλ.
**6** Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἰωρὰμ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἐκ Σαμαρείας, καὶ ἐπεσκέψατο τὸν Ἰσραήλ.
**7** Καὶ ἐπορεύθη, καὶ ἐξαπέστειλε πρὸς Ἰωσαφὰτ βασιλέα Ἰούδα, λέγων· βασιλεὺς Μωὰβ ἠθέτησεν ἐν ἐμοί· εἰ πορεύσῃ μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ εἰς Μωὰβ εἰς πόλεμον; Καὶ εἶπεν· ἀναβήσομαι· ὅμοιός μοι, ὅμοιός σοι· ὡς ὁ λαός μου, ὁ λαός σου· ὡς οἱ ἵπποι μου, οἱ ἵπποι σου.
**8** Καὶ εἶπε· ποίαν ὁδὸν ἀναβῶ; καὶ εἶπεν· ὁδὸν ἔρημον Ἐδώμ.
**9** Καὶ ἐπορεύθη ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἰούδα, καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἐδώμ, καὶ ἐκύκλωσαν ὁδὸν ἑπτὰ ἡμερῶν· καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὕδωρ τῇ παρεμβολῇ, καὶ τοῖς κτήνεσι τοῖς ἐν τοῖς ποσὶν αὐτῶν.
**10** Καὶ εἶπε βασιλεὺς Ἰσραήλ· ὤ, ὅτι κέκληκε Κύριος τοὺς τρεῖς βασιλεῖς παρερχομένους δοῦναι αὐτοὺς ἐν χεῖρι Μωάβ.
**11** Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰωσαφάτ· εἰ οὐκ ἔστιν ὧδε προφήτης τοῦ Κυρίου, καὶ ἐπιζητήσωμεν τὸν Κύριον παρ᾿ αὐτοῦ; καὶ ἀπεκρίθη εἷς τῶν παίδων βασιλέως Ἰσραήλ, καὶ εἶπεν· ὧδε Ἐλισσαῖε υἱὸς Σαφάτ, ὃς ἐπέχεεν ὕδωρ ἐπὶ χεῖρας Ἠλιοῦ.
**12** Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰωσαφάτ· ἔστιν σὺν αὐτῷ ῥῆμα Κυρίου. καὶ κατέβησαν πρὸς αὐτὸν βασιλεὺς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ Ἰωσαφὰτ βασιλεὺς Ἰούδα, καὶ βασιλεὺς Ἐδώμ.
**13** Καὶ εἶπεν Ἐλισσαῖε πρὸς βασιλέα Ἰσραήλ· τί ἐμοὶ καὶ σοί; δεῦρο πρὸς τοὺς προφήτας τοῦ πατρός σου, καὶ πρὸς τοὺς προφήτας τῆς μητρός σου. καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἰσραήλ· μὴ, ὅτι κέκληκε Κύριος τοὺς τρεῖς βασιλεῖς παρερχομένους τοῦ δοῦναι αὐτοὺς εἰς χεῖρας Μωάβ.
**14** Καὶ εἶπεν Ἐλισσαῖε· Ζῇ Κύριος τῶν δυνάμεων

### Chapter III.

**1** Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah; and he reigned twelve years.
**2** And he wrought that which was evil in the sight of the Lord; yet not as his father, nor as his mother; for he put away the cultic pillars of Baal, which his father had made.
**3** Nevertheless, unto the sin of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin, he clave; he was not drawn away from it.
**4** And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto the king of Israel, in rebellion, an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams with their wool.
**5** And it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab transgressed against the king of Israel.
**6** And King Jehoram went forth the same day out of Samaria, and mustered Israel.
**7** And he went, and sent unto Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, saying, "The king of Moab hath rebelled against me; wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle?" And he answered, "I will go up; [I am] like unto me, like unto thee; as my people, thy people; as my horses, thy horses."
**8** And he said, "By what way shall I go up?" And he answered, "By the way of the wilderness of Edom."
**9** So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom; and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey: and there was no water for the host, nor for the cattle that followed them.
**10** And the king of Israel said, "Alas! For the Lord hath called these three kings, coming hither, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!"
**11** And Jehoshaphat said, "Is there not here a prophet of the Lord, that we may inquire of the Lord by him?" And one of the servants of the king of Israel answered and said, "Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah."
**12** And Jehoshaphat said, "The word of the Lord is with him." So the king of Israel, and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, and the king of Edom went down to him.
**13** And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, "What have I to do with thee? Go unto the prophets of thy father, and unto the prophets of thy mother." And the king of Israel said unto him, "Nay, but the Lord hath called these three kings, coming hither, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!"
**14** And Elisha said, "As the Lord of Hosts liveth,
