πατρὸς αὐτοῦ. Καὶ Δαυὶδ διῆλθεν εἰς Μαναείμ, καὶ Ἀβεσσα- 24
λὼμ διῆλθε τὸν Ἰορδάνην, αὐτὸς καὶ πᾶς ἀνὴρ Ἰσραὴλ μετ’ αὐ-

ΚΑΙ ἐπεσκέψατο Δαυὶδ τὸν λαὸν τὸν μετ’ αὐτοῦ, καὶ κατέ- 1
στησεν ἐπ’ αὐτῶν ἑκατοντάρχους καὶ χιλιάρχους. Καὶ ἀπέστειλε 2
Δαυὶδ τὸν λαόν, τὸ τρίτον ἐν χειρὶ Ἰωάβ, καὶ τὸ τρίτον ἐν χει-
ρὶ Ἀβισσαί, υἱοῦ Σαρουίας, ἀδελφοῦ Ἰωάβ, καὶ τὸ τρίτον ἐν χει-
ρὶ Ἐθοεὶ τοῦ Γεθθαίου. Καὶ εἶπε Δαυὶδ πρὸς τὸν λαόν· ἐξελθὼν
ἐξελεύσομαι καί γε ἐγὼ μεθ’ ὑμῶν. Καὶ εἶπαν· οὐκ ἐξελεύσῃ, 3
ὅτι ἐὰν φυγῇ φυγῶμεν, οὐ θήσουσιν ἐφ’ ἡμᾶς καρδίαν· καὶ ἐὰν
ἀποθάνωμεν τὸ ἥμισυ ἡμῶν, οὐ θήσουσιν ἐφ’ ἡμᾶς καρδίαν, ὅτι σὺ
ὡς ἡμεῖς δέκα χιλιάδες. Καὶ νῦν ἀγαθόν, ἔτι ἔσῃ ἡμῖν ἐν τῇ
πόλει βοήθεια. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτοὺς ὁ βασιλεύς· ὃ ἐὰν ἀρέσῃ 4
ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς ὑμῶν, ποιήσω. Καὶ ἔστη ὁ βασιλεὺς ἀνὰ χεῖρα
τῆς πύλης· καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ἐξεπορεύετο εἰς ἑκατοντάδας καὶ εἰς
χιλιάδας. Καὶ ἐνετείλατο ὁ βασιλεὺς τῷ Ἰωάβ, καὶ τῷ Ἀβισσαί, 5
καὶ τῷ Ἐθοεί, λέγων· φείσασθέ μοι τοῦ παιδαρίου, τοῦ Ἀβεσ-
σαλώμ· καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ἤκουσεν ἐντελλομένου τοῦ βασιλέως πᾶ-

**24** And David passed over unto Mahanaim. And Absalom crossed the Jordan, he himself and all the men of Israel with him.

**25** And Absalom appointed Amasa instead of Joab over the host. Now Amasa was the son of a man, and his name was Jether the Israelite; this same went in to Abigail, the daughter of Nahash, sister of Zeruiah, Joab's mother.

**26** And all Israel encamped with Absalom in the land of Gilead.

**27** And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash, from Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and Machir the son of Amiel, from Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite, from Rogelim,

**28** brought forth ten beds, and tapestries, and ten cauldrons, and vessels of earthenware, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and groats, and beans, and lentils,

**29** and honey, and butter, and sheep, and Sapphod of oxen; and these they brought to David and to the people that were with him, to eat; for he said, 'The people are hungry, and thirsty, and faint in the wilderness.'

**3** But they answered, 'Thou shalt not go forth! For if we flee, they will not care for us; and if half of us perish, they will not regard us. For thou art [worth] as ten thousand of us. And now it is good that thou shouldst be to us in the city as a help.'

**4** And the king said unto them, 'Whatsoever seemeth good in your eyes, that will I do.' And the king stood by the gate's side; and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.

**5** And the king charged Joab, and Abishai, and Ittai, saying, 'Deal gently, for my sake, with the young man, even with Absalom.' And all the people heard when the king gave charge unto all the commanders concerning Absalom.
