¹ ΚΑΙ ἐν τῷ πρώτῳ ἔτει Κύρου τοῦ βασιλέως Περσῶν, τοῦ

Κύρος βασιλεὺς Περσῶν· πάσας τὰς βασιλείας τῆς γῆς ἔδωκέ μοι
Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ αὐτὸς ἐπεσκέψατο ἐπ᾿ ἐμὲ τοῦ
³ οἰκοδομῆσαι αὐτῷ οἶκον ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ τῇ ἐν τῇ Ἰουδαίᾳ. Τίς

**CHAPTER 1**

¹ Now in the first year of Cyrus the king of Persia, that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia,

² and he proclaimed a voice throughout all his kingdom, and also in writing, saying: "Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: All the kingdoms of the earth has the Lord God of Heaven given unto me; and He Himself has charged me

³ to build Him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whosoever among you of all His people, may his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and let him build the house of the God of Israel; He Himself [is] the God who is in Jerusalem.

⁴ And every one that remaineth from all the places where he sojourneth there, let the men of his place furnish him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with cattle, together with the freewill-offering for the house of God, which is in Jerusalem."

⁵ Then rose up the heads of the fathers' houses of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests and the Levites, even all whose spirit God had stirred up to go up to build the house of the Lord, which is in Jerusalem.

⁶ And all they that were round about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, and with goods, and with cattle, and with precious gifts, beside that which was offered willingly.

⁷ Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the Lord, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his god.

⁸ And Cyrus king of Persia brought them forth by the hand of Mithridates Gasbarnios, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.

⁹ And this is the number of them: thirty golden cooling-bowls, and one thousand silver cooling-bowls, twenty and nine altered [vessels], thirty golden Kephoureh-bowls, and three hundred and ten double silver [bowls],

¹⁰ one thousand other vessels. All the vessels of gold and of silver [were] five thousand four hundred.
