ΕΓΕΝΕΤΟ δὲ ὡς ἡ ἡμέρα αὕτη, καὶ ἦλθον οἱ ἄγγελοι τοῦ 1
Θεοῦ παραστῆναι ἔναντι Κυρίου. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ Κύριος τῷ διαβόλῳ· 2
πόθεν σὺ ἔρχῃ; τότε εἶπεν ὁ διάβολος ἔναντι Κυρίου· διαπορευθεὶς
τὴν ὑπ᾽ οὐρανόν, καὶ ἐμπεριπατήσας τὴν σύμπασαν, πάρειμι. Εἶπε 3
δὲ ὁ Κύριος πρὸς τὸν διάβολον· προσέσχες οὖν τῷ θεράποντί μου
Ἰώβ; ὅτι οὐκ ἔστι κατ᾽ αὐτὸν τῶν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς ἄνθρωπος (ὅμοιος
αὐτῷ), ἄμεμπτος, (δίκαιος) ἀληθινός, θεοσεβής, ἀπεχόμενος ἀπὸ
παντὸς κακοῦ, ἔτι δὲ ἔχεται ἀκακίας· σὺ δὲ εἶπας τὰ ὑπάρχοντα 4
αὐτοῦ ἀπολέσαι διακενῆς. Ὑπολαβὼν δὲ ὁ διάβολος, εἶπε τῷ Κυρίῳ·
δέρμα ὑπὲρ δέρματος, καὶ πάντα ὅσα ὑπάρχει τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ,
δώσει ὑπὲρ τῆς ψυχῆς αὐτοῦ· οὐ μὴν δὲ ἀλλὰ ἀποστείλας τὴν χεῖρά 5
σου, ἅψαι τῶν ὀστῶν αὐτοῦ καὶ τῶν σαρκῶν αὐτοῦ, εἰ μὴ εἰς
πρόσωπόν σου σὲ εὐλογήσει. Εἶπε δὲ ὁ Κύριος τῷ διαβόλῳ· ἰδοὺ 6
παραδίδωμί σοι αὐτόν· μόνον τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ διαφύλαξον. Ἐξῆλθε 7
δὲ ὁ διάβολος ἀπὸ προσώπου τοῦ Κυρίου, καὶ ἔπαισε τὸν Ἰὼβ
ἕλκει πονηρῷ ἀπὸ ποδῶν ἕως κεφαλῆς. Καὶ ἔλαβεν (Ἰὼβ) ἑαυτῷ 8
ὄστρακον, ἵνα ἀποξέῃ τὸν ἰχῶρα αὐτοῦ· καὶ αὐτὸς ἐκάθητο ἐπὶ τῆς
κοπρίας ἔξω τῆς πόλεως. Χρόνου δὲ πολλοῦ προβεβηκότος, καὶ εἶπεν 9
αὐτῷ ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ· μέχρις τίνος καρτερήσεις λέγων· ἰδοὺ,
ἀναμενῶ χρόνον ἔτι μικρόν, προσδεχόμενος τὴν ἐλπίδα τῆς σωτηρίας
μου. Ἰδοὺ γὰρ ἠφάνισται τὸ μνημόσυνόν σου ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς,
υἱοί σου καὶ θυγατέρες, τῆς ἐμῆς κοιλίας ὠδῖνες καὶ πόνοι, οὓς εἰς
τὸ κενὸν ἐκοπίασα μετὰ μόχθων· σὺ δὲ αὐτὸς ἐν σαπρίᾳ σκωλήκων
κάθησαι διανυκτερεύων αἴθριος· καὶ ἐγὼ πλανῆτις καὶ λάτρις, τόπον
ἐκ τόπου περιερχομένη, καὶ οἰκίαν ἐξ οἰκίας, προσδεχομένη
τὸν ἥλιον πότε δύσῃ, ἵνα ἀναπαύσωμαι τῶν μόχθων, καὶ τῶν περιεχουσῶν
με ὀδυνῶν, αἵ με νῦν συνέχουσιν. Ἀλλ᾽ εἰπόν τι ῥῆμα εἰς
Κύριον καὶ τελεύτα. Ὁ δὲ ἐμβλέψας αὐτῇ εἶπεν· (ἵνατί) ὥσπερ 10
μία τῶν ἀφρόνων γυναικῶν (οὕτως) ἐλάλησας. Εἰ τὰ μὲν ἀγαθὰ
ἐδεξάμεθα ἐκ χειρὸς Κυρίου, τὰ δὲ κακὰ οὐχ ὑποίσομεν; ἐν τούτοις
πᾶσι τοῖς συμβεβηκόσιν αὐτῷ οὐχ ἥμαρτεν Ἰὼβ οὐδὲ ἐν τοῖς
χείλεσιν αὐτοῦ ἔναντι τοῦ Θεοῦ. Ἀκούσαντες δὲ οἱ τρεῖς φίλοι 11
αὐτοῦ τὰ κακὰ πάντα ταῦτα τὰ ἐπελθόντα αὐτῷ, παρεγένοντο ἑκα-

## CHAPTER II.

1 Now again it came to pass upon a certain day, that the angels of God
    came to present themselves before the Lord.

2 And the Lord said unto the devil, "Whence comest thou?" Then the
    devil answered the Lord and said, "From going to and fro in the earth,
    and from walking up and down in it, am I come."

3 And the Lord said unto the devil, "Hast thou considered My servant Job?
    For there is none like him in the earth, [none like him,] a blameless,
    [righteous], true, God-fearing man, abstaining from all evil; and yet
    he holdeth fast his integrity, though thou stirredst Me up against him
    to destroy his possessions without cause."

4 Then the devil answered the Lord and said, "Skin for skin! Yea, all that
    a man hath will he give for his life.

5 But stretch forth now Thy hand, and touch his bone and his flesh, [and
    see] if he will not curse Thee to Thy face."

6 And the Lord said unto the devil, "Behold, he is in thy hand; only save
    his life."

7 So went the devil forth from the presence of the Lord, and smote Job with
    sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.

8 And (Job) took for himself a potsherd, wherewith to scrape away his
    matter; and he sat down upon the dung-heap outside the city.

9 And when much time had passed, his wife said unto him, "How long wilt
    thou endure, saying, 'Behold, I will wait yet a little while, expecting
    the hope of my salvation'? For behold, thy memorial is perished from the
    earth, even thy sons and thy daughters, the pangs and sorrows of my
    womb, whom I have toiled in vain with great labor. But thou thyself
    sittest among the decay of worms, passing thy nights in the open air;
    and I, a wanderer and a servant, going about from place to place, and
    from house to house, awaiting the sun when it setteth, that I may rest
    from my labors, and from the pains that now encompass me. But speak
    some word unto the Lord, and die."

10 But he looked upon her, and said, "Wherefore hast thou spoken thus, as
    one of the foolish women? If we have received good things from the hand
    of the Lord, shall we not endure evil things?" In all these things that
    befell him, Job sinned nothing, neither with his lips, before God.

11 Now when Job's three friends heard of all these evils that had come upon
    him, they came, ἑκα-
