αὐτῶν τοῦ πορεύεσθαι ἐν τῷ νόμῳ μου, ὡς ἐπορεύθης ἐναντίον
17 μου. Καὶ νῦν, Κύριε ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ, πιστωθήτω δὴ τὸ ῥῆμά σου
18 ὃ ἐλάλησας τῷ παιδί σου, τῷ Δαυίδ, ὅτι εἰ ἀληθῶς κατοικήσει ὁ
Θεὸς μετὰ ἀνθρώπων ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς; εἰ ὁ οὐρανὸς καὶ ὁ οὐρανὸς
τοῦ οὐρανοῦ οὐκ ἀρκέσουσί σοι, καὶ τίς ὁ οἶκος οὗτος ὃν ᾠκοδόμησα;
19 καὶ ἐπιβλέψῃ ἐπὶ τὴν προσευχὴν παιδός σου, καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν δέησίν
μου, Κύριε ὁ Θεός, τοῦ ἐπακοῦσαι τῆς δεήσεως, καὶ τῆς προσευχῆς
20 ἧς ὁ παῖς σου προσεύχεται ἐναντίον σου σήμερον, τοῦ εἶναι
ὀφθαλμούς σου ἀνεῳγμένους ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον τοῦτον ἡμέρας καὶ νυκτὸς,
εἰς τὸν τόπον τοῦτον ὃν εἶπας ἐπικληθῆναι τὸ ὄνομά σου
21 ἐκεῖ, τοῦ ἀκοῦσαι τῆς προσευχῆς, ἧς ὁ παῖς σου προσεύχεται εἰς
τὸν τόπον τοῦτον, καὶ ἀκούσῃ τῆς δεήσεως τοῦ παιδός σου, καὶ
λαοῦ σου Ἰσραήλ, ἃ ἂν προσεύξωνται εἰς τὸν τόπον τοῦτον· καὶ
σὺ εἰσακούσῃ ἐν τῷ τόπῳ τῆς κατοικήσεώς σου ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ,
22 καὶ ἀκούσῃ, καὶ ἵλεως ἔσῃ. Ἐὰν ἁμάρτῃ ἀνὴρ τῷ πλησίον αὐτοῦ,
καὶ λάβῃ ἐπ’ αὐτὸν ἀρὰν τοῦ ἀρᾶσθαι αὐτὸν, καὶ ἔλθῃ καὶ ἀράσηται
23 κατέναντι τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τούτῳ, καὶ σὺ εἰσακούσῃ
ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ ποιήσεις, καὶ κρινεῖς τοὺς δούλους σου
τοῦ ἀποδοῦναι τῷ ἀνόμῳ, καὶ ἀποδοῦναι ὁδοὺς αὐτοῦ εἰς κεφαλὴν
αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοῦ δικαιῶσαι δίκαιον, τοῦ ἀποδοῦναι αὐτῷ κατὰ τὴν
24 δικαιοσύνην αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐὰν θραυσθῇ ὁ λαός σου Ἰσραὴλ κατέναντι
τοῦ ἐχθροῦ, ἐὰν ἁμάρτωσί σοι, καὶ ἐπιστρέψωσι, καὶ ἐξομολογήσωνται
τῷ ὀνόματί σου, καὶ προσεύξωνται, καὶ δεηθῶσιν ἐναντίον
25 σου ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τούτῳ, καὶ σὺ εἰσακούσῃ ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ
ἵλεως ἔσῃ ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις τοῦ λαοῦ σου Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἀποστρέψεις
αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν γῆν ἣν ἔδωκας αὐτοῖς, καὶ τοῖς πατράσιν αὐτῶν.
26 Ἐν τῷ συσχεθῆναι τὸν οὐρανὸν, καὶ μὴ γενέσθαι ὑετὸν, ὅτι ἡμάρτησόνταί
σοι, καὶ προσεύξονται εἰς τὸν τόπον τοῦτον, καὶ αἰνέσουσι
τὸ ὄνομά σου, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν αὐτῶν ἐπιστρέψουσιν, ὅτι
27 ταπεινώσεις αὐτούς. Καὶ σὺ εἰσακούσῃ ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ ἵλεως
ἔσῃ ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις τῶν παίδων σου, καὶ τοῦ λαοῦ σου Ἰσραήλ, ὅτι
δηλώσεις αὐτοῖς τὴν ὁδὸν τὴν ἀγαθὴν, ἐν ᾗ πορεύσονται ἐν αὐτῇ,
καὶ δώσεις ὑετὸν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν σου, ἣν ἔδωκας τῷ λαῷ σου εἰς κληρονομίαν.
28 Λιμὸς ἐὰν γένηται ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, θάνατος ἐὰν γένηται,
ἀνεμοφθορία καὶ ἴκτερος, ἀκρὶς καὶ βροῦχος ἐὰν γένηται, ἐὰν θλίψῃ
αὐτὸν ὁ ἐχθρὸς κατέναντι τῶν πόλεων αὐτῶν, κατὰ πᾶσαν

¹⁷ And now, O Lord God of Israel, let Thy word be established which Thou spakest unto Thy servant, unto David.
¹⁸ For if God indeed shall dwell with men upon the earth? Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain Thee; and what then is this house which I have built?
¹⁹ And mayest Thou look upon the prayer of Thy servant, and upon my supplication, O Lord God, to hearken unto the supplication and the prayer which Thy servant prayeth before Thee this day,
²⁰ that Thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night, even upon this place of which Thou hast said that Thy Name should be called there; to hearken unto the prayer which Thy servant prayeth toward this place;
²¹ and hear Thou the supplication of Thy servant, and of Thy people Israel, whatsoever they shall pray toward this place; and Thou shalt hear from the place of Thy habitation, from heaven, and shalt hear, and be merciful.
²² If a man shall sin against his neighbor, and an oath be laid upon him to swear against him, and he come and swear before Thine altar in this house;
²³ then Thou shalt hear from heaven, and shalt do, and shalt judge Thy servants, by recompensing the wicked, and by bringing his ways upon his own head, and by justifying the righteous, by giving him according to his righteousness.
²⁴ And if Thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against Thee, and they turn again, and confess Thy Name, and pray, and make supplication before Thee in this house;
²⁵ then Thou shalt hear from heaven, and shalt be merciful unto the sins of Thy people Israel, and shalt bring them again unto the land which Thou gavest unto them, and unto their fathers.
²⁶ When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they shall have sinned against Thee, and they shall pray toward this place, and praise Thy Name, and turn from their sins, because Thou wilt humble them;
²⁷ then Thou shalt hear from heaven, and shalt be merciful unto the sins of Thy servants, and of Thy people Israel, for Thou wilt show them the good way wherein they should walk, and wilt send rain upon Thy land, which Thou gavest to Thy people for an inheritance.
²⁸ If there be famine in the land, if there be pestilence, blight and mildew, locust and cankerworm, if the enemy oppress him within his cities, [or] according to every
