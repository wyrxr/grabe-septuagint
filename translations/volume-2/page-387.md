μῳ, οὐχ ὑστέρησαν· ἱμάτια αὐτῶν οὐκ ἐπαλαιώθησαν καὶ ὑποδήματα
22 αὐτῶν οὐ διερράγησαν. Καὶ ἔδωκας αὐτοῖς βασιλείας, καὶ
λαοὺς διέμερισας αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἐκληρονόμησαν τὴν γῆν Σηὼν βασιλέως
Ἑσεβὼν, καὶ τὴν γῆν Ὤγ βασιλέως τοῦ Βασάν.
23 Καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτῶν ἐπλήθυνας ὡς τοὺς ἀστέρας τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ
εἰσήγαγες αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν γῆν ἣν εἶπας τοῖς πατράσιν αὐτῶν, καὶ
ἐκληρονόμησαν αὐτήν.
24 Καὶ ἐξέτριψας ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν τοὺς κατοικοῦντας τὴν γῆν τῶν
Χαναναίων, καὶ ἔδωκας αὐτοὺς εἰς τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν, καὶ τοὺς
βασιλεῖς αὐτῶν καὶ τοὺς λαοὺς τῆς γῆς, ποιῆσαι αὐτοῖς ὡς ἀρεστὸν
ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν.
25 Καὶ κατελάβοσαν πόλεις ὑψηλὰς, καὶ ἐκληρονόμησαν οἰκίας
πλήρεις πάντων ἀγαθῶν, λάκκους λελατομημένους, ἀμπελῶνας καὶ
ἐλαιῶνας, καὶ πᾶν ξύλον βρώσιμον εἰς πλῆθος· καὶ ἐφάγοσαν, καὶ
ἐνεπλήσθησαν, καὶ ἐλιπάνθησαν, καὶ ἐνετρύφησαν ἐν ἀγαθωσύνη
σου τῇ μεγάλῃ.
26 Καὶ ἤλλαξαν, καὶ ἀπέστησαν ἀπὸ σοῦ, καὶ ἔῤῥιψαν τὸν νόμον
σου ὀπίσω σώματος αὐτῶν· καὶ τοὺς προφήτας σου ἀπέκτειναν, οἳ
διεμαρτυροῦντο ἐν αὐτοῖς ἐπιστρέψαι αὐτοὺς πρὸς σέ· καὶ ἐποίησαν
παροργισμοὺς μεγάλους.
27 Καὶ ἔδωκας αὐτοὺς ἐν χειρὶ θλιβόντων αὐτοὺς, καὶ ἔθλιψαν
αὐτούς· καὶ ἀνεβόησαν πρὸς σὲ ἐν καιρῷ θλίψεως αὐτῶν, καὶ σὺ
ἐξ οὐρανοῦ ἤκουσας, καὶ ἐν οἰκτιρμοῖς σου τοῖς μεγάλοις ἔδωκας
αὐτοῖς σωτῆρας, καὶ ἔσωσας αὐτοὺς ἐκ χειρὸς θλιβόντων αὐτοὺς.
28 Καὶ ὡς ἀνεπαύσαντο, ἐπέστρεψαν ποιῆσαι τὸ πονηρὸν ἐνώπιόν
σου· καὶ ἐγκατέλιπες αὐτοὺς εἰς χεῖρας ἐχθρῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ κατήρξαν
ἐν αὐτοῖς. καὶ πάλιν ἀνεβόησαν πρὸς σὲ, καὶ σὺ οὐρανοῦ εἰσήκουσας,
καὶ ἐῤῥύσω αὐτοὺς ἐν οἰκτιρμοῖς σου πολλοῖς.
29 καὶ ἐπεμαρτύρω αὐτοῖς ἐπιστρέψαι αὐτοὺς εἰς τὸν νόμον σου· καὶ
οὐκ ἤκουσαν, ἀλλ᾿ ἐν ταῖς ἐντολαῖς σου καὶ τοῖς κρίμασί σου
ἡμάρτοσαν, ἃ ποιήσας αὐτὰ ἄνθρωπος ζήσεται ἐν αὐτοῖς· καὶ ἔδωκαν
νῶτον ἀπειθοῦντα, καὶ τράχηλον ἑαυτῶν ἐσκλήρυναν, καὶ οὐκ
ἤκουσαν.
30 Καὶ ἤλκυσας ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς ἔτη πολλὰ, καὶ ἐπεμαρτύρω αὐτοῖς ἐν
πνεύματί σου ἐν χειρὶ προφητῶν σου, καὶ οὐκ ἐνωτίσαντο, καὶ ἔδωκας
αὐτοὺς ἐν χειρὶ λαῶν τῆς γῆς.
31 Καὶ σὺ ἐν οἰκτιρμοῖς σου τοῖς πολλοῖς οὐκ ἐποίησας αὐτοὺς
συντέλειαν, καὶ οὐκ ἐγκατέλιπες αὐτοὺς, ὅτι ἰσχυρὸς εἶ, καὶ ἐλεήμων,
καὶ οἰκτίρμων.
32 Καὶ νῦν ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν ὁ ἰσχυρὸς, ὁ μέγας, ὁ κραταιὸς, καὶ ὁ
φοβερὸς, φυλάσσων τὴν διαθήκην καὶ τὸ ἔλεός σου, μὴ ὀλιγωθήτω
ἐνώπιόν σου

#### NEHEMIAH CHAPTER 9

<sup>21</sup> They lacked nothing;
their garments waxed not old,
nor their sandals were torn.
<sup>22</sup> Moreover, Thou gavest them kingdoms,
and didst divide peoples unto them;
and they inherited the land of Sihon, king of Heshbon,
and the land of Og, king of Bashan.
<sup>23</sup> And their sons didst Thou multiply as the stars of heaven,
and didst bring them into the land
which Thou hadst promised unto their fathers,
and they inherited it.
<sup>24</sup> And Thou didst drive out before them
the inhabitants of the land, even the Canaanites,
and didst deliver them into their hands,
both their kings and the peoples of the land,
to do with them as was pleasing in their sight.
<sup>25</sup> And they took possession of high cities,
and inherited houses full of all good things,
cisterns already hewn,
vineyards and olive groves,
and every fruit tree in abundance;
so they did eat, and were filled, and waxed fat,
and delighted themselves in Thy great goodness.
<sup>26</sup> Yet they turned, and departed from Thee,
and cast Thy Law behind their backs;
and Thy prophets they slew,
who did bear witness among them,
that they might turn unto Thee;
and they wrought great provocations.
<sup>27</sup> Therefore, didst Thou deliver them into the hand of their oppressors,
and they did oppress them;
but they cried unto Thee in the time of their distress,
and Thou from heaven didst hear,
and in Thy great compassions didst Thou give them deliverers,
who saved them from the hand of their oppressors.
<sup>28</sup> But when they had rest,
they turned again to do evil before Thee;
and Thou didst forsake them into the hands of their enemies,
and they had dominion over them.
Yet again they cried unto Thee,
and Thou didst hear from heaven,
and didst rescue them in Thy manifold mercies.
<sup>29</sup> And Thou didst testify against them,
to turn them back unto Thy Law;
but they hearkened not,
but in Thy commandments and Thy judgments
did they sin,
[even those] which if a man do, he shall live in them.
And they gave a rebellious back,
and stiffened their neck,
and hearkened not.
<sup>30</sup> Moreover, many years didst Thou bear with them,
and didst testify against them by Thy Spirit,
through the hand of Thy prophets;
but they gave no ear,
and Thou didst deliver them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.
<sup>31</sup> Nevertheless, in Thy many compassions,
Thou didst not utterly consume them,
nor didst Thou forsake them;
for Thou art mighty, and merciful, and compassionate.
<sup>32</sup> And now, O our God, the Mighty, the Great,
the Powerful, and the Awesome,
Who keepest the covenant and Thy mercy,
let not all this trouble seem slight before Thee,
