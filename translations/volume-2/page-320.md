13 θαλμοὶ ἡμῶν. Καὶ πᾶς Ἰούδας ἑστηκὼς ἐναντίον Κυρίου, καὶ τὰ
14 παιδία αὐτῶν, καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες αὐτῶν. Καὶ τῷ Ὀζιὴλ τῷ τοῦ Ζα-
      χαρία, τῷ υἱῷ Βαναίου, τῷ υἱῷ Ἐλεήλ, τοῦ Ματθανίου τοῦ
15 Λευίτου ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν Ἀσάφ, ἐγένετο ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν πνεῦμα Κυρίου
      ἐν τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ, καὶ εἶπεν· ἀκούσατε πᾶς Ἰούδα, καὶ οἱ κατοικοῦν-
      τες Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἰωσαφάτ· τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὑ-
      μῖν αὐτοῖς· μὴ φοβεῖσθε, μηδὲ πτοηθῆτε ἀπὸ προσώπου τοῦ ὄχ-
      λου τοῦ πολλοῦ τούτου, ὅτι οὐχ ὑμῖν ἐστιν ἡ παράταξις, ἀλλ᾿ ἡ
16 τῷ Θεῷ· αὔριον κατάβητε ἐπ᾿ αὐτούς· ἰδοὺ ἀναβαίνουσι κατὰ τὴν
      ἀνάβασιν Ἄσσεις, καὶ εὑρήσετε αὐτοὺς ἐπ᾿ ἄκρου ποταμοῦ τῆς
17 ἐρήμου Ἰεριήλ. Οὐχ ὑμῖν ἐστι πολεμῆσαι· ταῦτα σύνετε, καὶ ἴδε-
      τε τὴν σωτηρίαν Κυρίου μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν, Ἰούδα καὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ· μὴ
      φοβεῖσθε, μηδὲ πτοηθῆτε· αὔριον ἐξελθεῖν εἰς ἀπάντησιν αὐτοῖς, καὶ
18 Κύριος μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν. Καὶ κύψας Ἰωσαφὰτ ἐπὶ πρόσωπον ἑαυτοῦ,
      καὶ πᾶς Ἰούδα, καὶ οἱ κατοικοῦντες ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, ἔπεσον ἐναν-
19 τίον Κυρίου προσκυνῆσαι Κυρίῳ. Καὶ ἀνέστησαν οἱ Λευῖται ἀπὸ
      τῶν υἱῶν Καάθ, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν Κορέ, αἰνεῖν Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ
20 Ἰσραὴλ ἐν φωνῇ μεγάλῃ εἰς ὕψος, καὶ ὤρθρισαν τοπρωΐ, καὶ ἐξ-
      ἦλθον εἰς τὴν ἔρημον Θεκωέ· καὶ ἐν τῷ ἐξελθεῖν αὐτούς, ἔστη Ἰω-
      σαφὰτ καὶ ἐβόησε, καὶ εἶπεν· ἀκούσατέ μου, Ἰούδα, καὶ οἱ κατοικοῦντες
      ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ· ἐμπιστεύσατε ἐν Κυρίῳ Θεῷ ὑμῶν, καὶ
21 ἐμπιστευθήσεσθε· ἐμπιστεύσατε ἐν προφήτῃ αὐτοῦ, καὶ εὐοδωθήσε-
      σθε. Καὶ ἐβουλεύσατο μετὰ τοῦ λαοῦ, καὶ ἔστησε ψαλτῳδοὺς καὶ
      αἰνοῦντας, ἐξομολογεῖσθαι καὶ αἰνεῖν τὰ ἅγια ἐν τῷ ἐξελθεῖν ἔμ-
      προσθεν τῆς δυνάμεως, καὶ ἔλεγον· ἐξομολογεῖσθε τῷ Κυρίῳ, ὅτι
22 εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐν τῷ ἐνάρξασθαι τῆς αἰνέ-
      σεως αὐτοῦ καὶ τῆς ἐξομολογήσεως, ἔδωκε Κύριος πολεμεῖν τοὺς
      υἱοὺς Ἀμμὼν ἐπὶ Μωὰβ καὶ ὄρος Σηείρ τοὺς ἐξελθόντας ἐπὶ Ἰού-
23 δαν, καὶ ἐτροπώθησαν. Καὶ ἀνέστησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἀμμὼν καὶ Μωὰβ
      ἐπὶ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας ὄρος Σηείρ, ἐξολεθρεῦσαι καὶ ἐκτρῖψαι. καὶ
      ὡς συνετέλεσαν τοὺς κατοικοῦντας Σηείρ, ἀνέστησαν εἰς ἀλλήλους
24 τοῦ ἐξολεθρευθῆναι. Καὶ Ἰούδας ἦλθεν ἐπὶ τὴν σκοπιὰν τῆς ἐρή-
      μου, καὶ ἐπέβλεψε, καὶ εἶδε τὸ πλῆθος· καὶ ἰδοὺ πάντες νεκροὶ πε-
25 πτωκότες ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, οὐκ ἦν σωζόμενος. Καὶ ἦλθεν Ἰωσαφὰτ
      καὶ ὁ λαὸς αὐτοῦ σκυλεῦσαι τὰ σκῦλα αὐτῶν, καὶ εὗρον κτήνη

¹³ [but] our eyes [are] upon Thee. And all Judah stood before the Lord, with their little children and their wives.

¹⁴ And upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of the Lord in the midst of the assembly; and he said,

²² And when they began to sing praises and to give thanks, the Lord caused the children of Ammon to make war against Moab and Mount Seir, who had come against Judah; and they were routed.

²³ For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir, to utterly destroy and to root them out. And when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, they stood up against one another to destroy each other.

²⁴ And when Judah came upon the watchtower in the wilderness, and looked, they saw the multitude: and, behold, all were dead bodies fallen upon the earth, and none had escaped.
