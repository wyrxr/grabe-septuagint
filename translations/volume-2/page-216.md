ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Δʹ. ΚΕΦ. ΙΕʹ. ΙΣʹ.
**38** καὶ τὸν Φακεὲ υἱὸν Ῥομελίου. Καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Ἰωάθαμ μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐτάφη μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ ἐν πόλει Δαυὶδ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Ἄχαζ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΣΤʹ. XVI.
**1** Ἐν ἔτει ἑπτακαιδεκάτῳ Φακεὲ υἱοῦ Ῥομελίου ἐβασίλευσεν Ἄχαζ υἱὸς Ἰωάθαμ βασιλέως Ἰούδα. **2** Υἱὸς εἴκοσι ἐτῶν ἦν Ἄχαζ ἐν τῷ βασιλεύειν αὐτὸν, καὶ ἐκκαίδεκα ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ἰερουσαλήμ. Καὶ οὐκ ἐποίησε τὸ εὐθὲς ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς Κυρίου Θεοῦ αὐτοῦ πιστῶς, ὡς Δαυὶδ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ. **3** Καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἐν ὁδῷ Ἱεροβοὰμ υἱοῦ Ναβὰτ βασιλέως Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ γε τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ διῆγεν ἐν πυρὶ κατὰ τὰ βδελύγματα τῶν ἐθνῶν ὧν ἐξῆρε Κύριος ἀπὸ προσώπου τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ. **4** Καὶ ἐθυσίαζε καὶ ἐθυμία ἐν τοῖς ὑψηλοῖς, καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν βουνῶν, καὶ ὑποκάτω παντὸς ξύλου ἀλσώδους. **5** Τότε ἀνέβη Ῥαασσὼν βασιλεὺς Συρίας, καὶ Φακεὲ υἱὸς Ῥομελίου βασιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ εἰς πόλεμον, καὶ ἐπολιόρκουν ἐπὶ Ἄχαζ, καὶ οὐκ ἐδύναντο πολεμεῖν. **6** Ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ ἀπέστρεψε Ῥαασσὼν βασιλεὺς Συρίας τὴν Αἰλὰμ τῇ Συρίᾳ, καὶ ἐξέβαλε τοὺς Ἰουδαίους ἐξ Αἰλὰμ, καὶ Ἰδουμαῖοι ἦλθον εἰς Αἰλὰμ, καὶ κατῴκησαν ἐκεῖ ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης. **7** Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ἄχαζ ἀγγέλους πρὸς Θαλγαθφελλασσὰρ βασιλέα Ἀσσυρίων, λέγων· δοῦλός σου, καὶ υἱός σου ἐγὼ, ἀνάβηθι, καὶ σῶσόν με ἐκ χειρὸς βασιλέως Συρίας, καὶ ἐκ χειρὸς βασιλέως Ἰσραὴλ, τῶν ἐπανισταμένων ἐπ᾿ ἐμέ. **8** Καὶ ἔλαβεν Ἄχαζ τὸ ἀργύριον, καὶ τὸ χρυσίον τὸ εὑρεθὲν ἐν θησαυροῖς οἴκου Κυρίου, καὶ οἴκου τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ ἀπέστειλε τῷ βασιλεῖ Ἀσσυρίων δῶρα. **9** Καὶ ἤκουσεν αὐτοῦ βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων· καὶ ἀνέβη βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων εἰς Δαμασκὸν, καὶ συνέλαβεν αὐτὴν, καὶ ἀπῴκισεν αὐτὴν Κυρῖνον δὲ καὶ τὸν Ῥαασσὼν ἐθανάτωσε. **10** Καὶ ἐπορεύθη βασιλεὺς Ἄχαζ εἰς ἀπάντησιν τῷ Θαλγαθφελλασσὰρ βασιλεῖ Ἀσσυρίων εἰς Δαμασκὸν· καὶ εἶδε τὸ θυσιαστήριον τὸ ἐν Δαμασκῷ. Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἄχαζ πρὸς Οὐρίαν τὸν ἱερέα τὸ ὁμοίωμα τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου, καὶ τὸν ῥυθμὸν αὐτοῦ εἰς πᾶσαν ποίησιν αὐτοῦ. **11** Καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν Οὐρίας ὁ ἱερεὺς τὸ θυσιαστήριον κατὰ πάντα

### 2 Kings 15

**38** and Pekah, the son of Remaliah. And Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.

### 2 Kings 16

**1** In the seventeenth year of Pekah, the son of Remaliah, Ahaz, the son of Jotham, king of Judah, began to reign.
**2** Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And he did not that which was right in the sight of the LORD his God faithfully, as David his father [had done].
**3** But he walked in the way of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, king of Israel; yea, he even caused his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom the LORD had cast out from before the face of the children of Israel.
**4** And he sacrificed and burned incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
**5** Then Rezin, king of Syria, and Pekah, the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, came up to Jerusalem to war; and they besieged Ahaz, but they could not overcome him.
**6** At that time Rezin, king of Syria, recovered Elath to Syria, and drove out the Jews from Elath; and the Edomites came to Elath, and dwelt there unto this day.
**7** And Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-Pileser, king of Assyria, saying, "I am thy servant and thy son; come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, who rise up against me."
**8** And Ahaz took the silver and the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and of the king's house, and sent [it as] a present to the king of Assyria.
**9** And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him; for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried its [people] away captive; and Kyrenos and Rezin he put to death.
**10** And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-Pileser, king of Assyria; and he saw the altar that was at Damascus. And king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the pattern of the altar, and the fashion thereof, according to all the workmanship thereof.
**11** And Urijah the priest built the altar according to all
