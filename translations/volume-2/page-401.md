σιλεῖ, δογματισάτω ἀπολέσαι αὐτούς, κἀγὼ διαγράφω εἰς τὸ γα-

μενος ὁ βασιλεὺς τὸν δακτύλιον αὐτοῦ, ἔδωκεν εἰς χεῖρας τῷ Ἀμάν,
σφραγίσαι κατὰ τῶν γεγραμμένων κατὰ τῶν Ἰουδαίων. Καὶ εἶ- 11
πεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τῷ Ἀμάν· τὸ μὲν ἀργύριον ἔχε, τῷ δὲ ἔθνει χρῶ
ὡς βούλει. Καὶ ἐκλήθησαν οἱ γραμματεῖς τοῦ βασιλέως μηνὶ πρώ- 12
τῳ τῇ τρισκαιδεκάτῃ, καὶ ἔγραφαν ὡς προσέταξεν Ἀμὰν τοῖς στρα-
τηγοῖς, καὶ τοῖς ἄρχουσι κατὰ πᾶσαν χώραν ἀπὸ τῆς Ἰνδικῆς ἕως
τῆς Αἰθιοπίας, ταῖς ἑκατὸν εἴκοσι καὶ ἑπτὰ χώραις, τοῖς τε ἄρ-
χουσι τῶν ἐθνῶν κατὰ τὴν αὐτῶν λέξιν, δι᾿ Ἀρταξέρξου τοῦ βα-
σιλέως. Καὶ ἀπεστάλη διὰ βιβλιαφόρων εἰς τὴν Ἀρταξέρξου βα-
σιλείαν, ἀφανίσαι τὸ γένος τῶν Ἰουδαίων ἐν ἡμέρᾳ μιᾷ μηνὸς δω- 13

δὲ ἐπιστολῆς ἐστι τὸ ἀντίγραφον τόδε· βασιλεὺς μέγας Ἀρταξέρ-
ξης τοῖς ἀπὸ τῆς Ἰνδικῆς ἕως τῆς Αἰθιοπίας ἑκατὸν εἴκοσι καὶ
ἑπτὰ χωρῶν ἄρχουσι καὶ τοπάρχαις ὑποτεταγμένοις τάδε γράφει·
πολλῶν ἐπάρξας ἐθνῶν, καὶ πάσης ἐπικρατήσας τῆς οἰκουμένης,
ἐβουλήθην μὴ τῷ θράσει τῆς ἐξουσίας ἐπαιρόμενος, ἐπιεικέστερον
δὲ καὶ μετὰ ἡπιότητος ἀεὶ διεξάγων τοὺς τῶν ὑποτεταγμένων
ἀκυμάντους διὰ παντὸς καταστῆσαι βίους, τήν τε βασιλείαν ἤρεμον
καὶ πορευτὴν ἄχρι περάτων παρεξόμενος, ἀνανεώσασθαί τε τὴν
ποθουμένην παρὰ πᾶσιν ἀνθρώποις εἰρήνην. πυθνομένου δέ μου
τῶν συμβούλων, πῶς ἂν ἀχθείη τοῦτο ἐπὶ πέρας, δ̓ σωφροσύνη
παρ᾿ ἡμῖν διενέγκας, καὶ ἐν τῇ εὐνοίᾳ ἀπαραλλάκτως, καὶ βεβαίᾳ
πίστει ἀποδεδειγμένος, καὶ δεύτερον τῶν βασιλέων γέρας ἀπενεγ-
κάμενος Ἀμάν, ὑπέδειξεν ἡμῖν ἐν πάσαις ταῖς κατὰ τὴν οἰκουμέ-
νην φυλαῖς ἀναμεμίχθαι δυσμενῆ λαόν τινα, τοῖς νόμοις ἀντίθετον
πρὸς πᾶν ἔθνος, τά τε τῶν βασιλέων παραπέμποντας διηνεκῶς δια-
τάγματα, πρὸς τὸ μὴ κατατίθεσθαι τὴν ὑφ᾿ ἡμῶν κατευθυνομένην
ἀμέμπτως συναρχίαν. διελῃφότες οὖν τόδε ἔθνος μονώτατον ἐν
ἀντιπαραγωγῇ παντὶ διαπαντὸς ἀνθρώπῳ κείμενον, διαγωγὴν νό-
μων ξενίζουσαν παραλλάσσον, καὶ δυσνοοῦν τοῖς ἡμετέροις πράγ-
μασι τὰ χείριστα συντελοῦν κακά, καὶ πρὸς τὸ μὴ τὴν βασιλείαν
εὐσταθείας τυγχάνειν· προσετάξαμεν οὖν τοὺς σημαινομένους ὑμῖν
ἐν τοῖς γεγραμμένοις ὑπὸ Ἀμὰν τοῦ τεταγμένου ἐπὶ τῶν πραγμά-

#### CHAPTER III

<sup>9</sup> If it therefore please the king, let it be decreed that they be utterly destroyed, and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the king's treasury.
<sup>10</sup> And the king took off his ring from his hand, and gave it into the hands of Haman, to seal [the document] which was written against the Jews.
<sup>11</sup> And the king said unto Haman, "The silver is thine to keep; but as for the people, do with them as it pleaseth thee."
<sup>12</sup> Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month; and they wrote, according as Haman had commanded, unto the king's generals, and to the governors that were over every province from India unto Ethiopia, to the one hundred and twenty and seven provinces, and unto the rulers of the peoples, according to their own language; [and this was done] by King Artaxerxes.
<sup>13</sup> And it was sent by messengers into the kingdom of Artaxerxes, to utterly destroy the race of the Jews in one day, even on the twelfth month, which is Adar, and to plunder their possessions. And the copy of the letter is this:

King Artaxerxes the Great unto the rulers and toparchs who are subject unto him from India even unto Ethiopia, over one hundred and twenty and seven provinces, thus doth he write:

Forasmuch as I have held sway over many nations, and have gotten the dominion over all the inhabited earth, I purposed, not being lifted up by the boldness of power, but ever conducting myself more gently and with mildness, to establish the lives of those subject [unto me] in perpetual tranquility, and to render the kingdom calm and traversable even unto its uttermost bounds, and to renew the peace which is desired by all mankind.

And when I inquired of my counselors, how this might be brought to pass—but prudence amongst us excelling, and in loyalty unswerving, and in firm faith proven, and bearing off the second royal honor, Haman—he did show unto us that throughout all the tribes in the inhabited world there is mingled a certain hostile people, whose laws are contrary unto every nation, and who do perpetually set aside the ordinances of kings, so as to hinder the blameless conjoint rule, which is directed by us, from being established. Therefore, having perceived this nation to be altogether singular, and ever standing in opposition to every man, changing [itself] by a foreign conduct of laws, and being ill-disposed toward our affairs, perpetrating the direst evils, and preventing the kingdom from attaining stability, we have therefore commanded that those whom Haman, who is appointed over affairs, and our second father, hath indicated unto you in the writings, all of them, with their wives and children,
