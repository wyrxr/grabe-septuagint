ΚΕΦ. Ιʹ.
6 ὀφθαλμοῖς σου ποιήσομεν. Καὶ ἔγραφε πρὸς αὐτοὺς βιβλίον δεύ-
τερον, λέγων· εἰ ἐμοὶ ὑμεῖς, καὶ τῆς φωνῆς μου ὑμεῖς εἰσακούετε,
λάβετε τὴν κεφαλὴν ἀνδρῶν τῶν υἱῶν τοῦ κυρίου ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐνέγ-
κατε πρὸς μέ, ὡς ἡ ὥρα αὔριον, εἰς ᾿Ιεζράελ. Καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ
βασιλέως ἦσαν ἑβδομήκοντα ἄνδρες, οὗτοι ἄδροι τῆς πόλεως ἐξέ-
7 τρεφον αὐτούς. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἦλθε τὸ βιβλίον πρὸς αὐτοὺς, καὶ
ἔλαβον τοὺς υἱοὺς τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ ἔσφαξαν ἑβδομήντα ἄνδρας,
καὶ ἔθηκαν τὰς κεφαλὰς αὐτῶν ἐν καρτάλλοις, καὶ ἀπέστειλαν
8 αὐτὰς πρὸς αὐτὸν εἰς ᾿Ιεζράελ. Καὶ ἦλθεν ὁ ἄγγελος, καὶ ἀπήγ-
γειλε, λέγων· ἤνεγκαν τὰς κεφαλὰς τῶν υἱῶν τοῦ βασιλέως. καὶ
εἶπε· θέτε αὐτὰς βουνοὺς δύο παρὰ τὴν θύραν τῆς πόλεως εἰς
9 πρωΐ. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν πρωΐᾳ, καὶ ἐξῆλθε, καὶ ἔστη, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς
πάντα τὸν λαόν· δίκαιοι ὑμεῖς, ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ εἰμι συνεστράφην ἐπὶ τὸν
κύριόν μου, καὶ ἀπέκτεινα αὐτόν. Καὶ τίς ἐπάταξε πάντας τούτους;
10 Ἴδετε ἀπὸ τοῦ, ὅτι οὐ πεσεῖται ἀπὸ τοῦ ῥήματος Κυρίου, εἰς τὴν
γῆν, οὗ ἐλάλησε Κύριος ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον ᾿Αχαάβ. Καὶ Κύριος ἐποίη-
11 σεν ὅσα ἐλάλησεν ἐν χειρὶ δούλου αὐτοῦ ᾿Ηλιοῦ. Καὶ ἐπάταξεν
᾿Ιηοῦ πάντας τοὺς ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ ᾿Αχαὰβ καταλειφθέντας ἐν τῷ ᾿Ιεζ-
ράελ, καὶ πάντας τοὺς ἁδροὺς αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοὺς γνωστάς αὐτοῦ,
καὶ τοὺς ἱερεῖς αὐτοῦ, ὥστε μὴ καταλιπεῖν αὐτοῦ κατάλειμμα.
12 Καὶ ἀνέστη, καὶ ἦλθε, καὶ ἐπορεύθη εἰς Σαμάρειαν, αὐτὸς ἐν Βαι-
13 θακάδ τῶν ποιμένων ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ. Καὶ ᾿Ιηοῦ εὗρε τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς
᾿Οχοζίου βασιλέως ᾿Ιούδα, καὶ εἶπε· τίνες ὑμεῖς; καὶ εἶπον· οἱ
ἀδελφοὶ ᾿Οχοζίου ἡμεῖς, καὶ κατέβημεν εἰς εἰρήνην τῶν υἱῶν τοῦ
14 βασιλέως. καὶ τῶν υἱῶν τῆς δυναστευούσης. Καὶ εἶπε· συλλάβετε
αὐτοὺς ζῶντας. Καὶ συνελάβοντο αὐτοὺς ζῶντας, καὶ ἔσφαξαν αὐ-
τοὺς εἰς Βαιθακάδ, τεσσαράκοντα καὶ δύο ἄνδρας· οὐ κατέλιπεν
ἄνδρα ἐξ αὐτῶν.
15 Καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἐκεῖθεν, καὶ εὗρε τὸν ᾿Ιωναδὰβ υἱὸν
Ῥηχὰβ εἰς ἀπάντησιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ εὐλόγησεν αὐτόν. καὶ εἶπε πρὸς
αὐτὸν ᾿Ιηοῦ· εἰ ἔστι (μετὰ σοῦ) καρδία σου εὐθεῖα, καθὼς ἡ καρδία
μου μετὰ τῆς καρδίας σου; καὶ εἶπεν ᾿Ιωναδάβ· ἔστιν. καὶ εἶπεν
᾿Ιηοῦ· καὶ εἰ ἔστι, δὸς τὴν χεῖρά σου. καὶ ἔδωκε τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ·
καὶ ἀνεβίβασεν αὐτὸν πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὸ ἅρμα, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὑ-
16 τὸν· δεῦρο μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ, καὶ ἴδε ἐν τῷ ζηλῶσαί με τῷ Κυρίῳ· καὶ
17 ἐπεκάθισεν αὐτὸν ἐν τῷ ἅρματι αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς Σαμά-
ρειαν, καὶ ἐπάταξε πάντας τοὺς καταλειφθέντας τοῦ ᾿Αχαὰβ ἐν

Then he wrote a second letter unto them, saying, "If ye be for me, and if ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the heads of the sons of your master, and bring them unto me by this hour tomorrow to Jezreel." Now the king's sons were seventy men, [and] these chief men of the city brought them up.

**7** And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and slew seventy men, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them to him to Jezreel.

**8** And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, "They have brought the heads of the king's sons." And he said, "Lay ye them in two heaps by the entrance of the city until the morning."

**9** And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said unto all the people, "Ye are righteous. Behold, I am. I conspired against my master, and slew him. But who hath smitten all these?

**10** Know ye now, that there shall not fall to the ground one word of the LORD, which the LORD spake concerning the house of Ahab.

**11** And the LORD hath done whatsoever He spake by the hand of His servant Elijah. And Jehu smote all them that were left of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his chief men, and his kinsfolk, and his priests, until he left him no remnant.

**12** And he arose, and departed, and went to Samaria, [and he was] at Beth-eked of the Shepherds on the way.

**13** And Jehu found the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, "Who are ye?" And they answered, "We are the brethren of Ahaziah, and we are come down to greet the sons of the king, and the sons of the ruling queen."

**14** And he said, "Take them alive." So they took them alive, and slew them at Beth-eked, forty and two men; he left not a single man of them.

**15** And when he had departed thence, he found Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him; and he blessed him. And Jehu said unto him, "If thine heart be upright (with thee), as my heart is with thy heart?" And Jehonadab answered, "It is." Then Jehu said, "And if it be, give me thine hand." And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot, and he said unto him,

**16** "Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD."

**17** So he made him sit in his chariot, and he came into Samaria, and smote all that remained unto Ahab in
