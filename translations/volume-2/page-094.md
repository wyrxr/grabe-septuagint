ΚΕΦ. ΙΔʹ. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Βʹ. 570
6 ἀνήρ μου. Καί γε τῇ δούλῃ σου δύο υἱοί, καὶ ἐμαχέσαντο ἀμφότε-
ροι ἐν τῷ ἀγρῷ, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ ἐξαιρούμενος ἀναμέσον αὐτῶν.
Καὶ ἔπαισεν εἷς τὸν ἕνα ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐθανάτωσεν αὐτόν.
7 Καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐπανέστη ὅλη ἡ πατριὰ πρὸς τὴν δούλην σου, καὶ εἶπαν·
Δὸς τὸν παίσαντα τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ θανατώσομεν αὐτὸν ἀν-
τὶ τῆς ψυχῆς τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ οὗ ἀπέκτεινε, καὶ ἐξαροῦμεν
καί γε τὸν κληρονόμον ἡμῶν. Καὶ σβέσουσι τὸν ἄνθρακά μου τὸν
καταλειφθέντα, ὥστε μὴ θέσθαι τῷ ἀνδρί μου ὄνομα καὶ κατά-
8 λειμμα ἐπὶ προσώπου τῆς γῆς. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς πρὸς τὴν
γυναῖκα· ῾Υγιαίνουσα βάδιζε εἰς τὸν οἶκόν σου, κἀγὼ ἐντελοῦμαι
9 περὶ σοῦ. Καὶ εἶπεν ἡ γυνὴ ἡ Θεκωίτις πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα· ἐπ᾿
ἐμέ, κύριέ μου βασιλεῦ, ἡ ἀνομία καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον τοῦ πατρός
10 μου, καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ ὁ θρόνος αὐτοῦ ἀθῶος. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ
βασιλεύς· τίς ὁ λαλῶν πρὸς σε, καὶ ἄξεις αὐτὸν πρὸς ἐμέ, καὶ
11 οὐ μὴ προσθήσει ἔτι ἅψασθαι αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπε· μνημονευσάτω
δὴ ὁ βασιλεὺς τὸν Κύριον Θεὸν αὐτοῦ πληθῦναι ἀγχιστέα τοῦ αἵ-
ματος τοῦ διαφθεῖραι, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἐξάρσι τὸν υἱόν μου. Καὶ εἶ-
πε· Ζῇ Κύριος, εἰ πεσεῖται ἀπὸ τῆς τριχὸς τοῦ υἱοῦ σου ἐπὶ τὴν
12 γῆν. Καὶ εἶπεν ἡ γυνή· λαλησάτω δὴ ἡ δούλη σου πρὸς τὸν κύ-
13 ριόν μου τὸν βασιλέα ῥῆμα. Καὶ εἶπε· λάλησον. Καὶ εἶπεν ἡ γυ-
νή· ἵνατί ἐλογίσω τοιοῦτο ἐπὶ λαὸν Θεοῦ; ἢ ἐκ στόματος τοῦ
βασιλέως ὁ λόγος οὗτος ὡς πλημμέλεια, τοῦ μὴ ἐπιστρέψαι πρὸς
14 τὸν βασιλέα τὸν ἐξωσμένον αὐτοῦ; Ὅτι θανάτῳ ἀποθανούμεθα,
καὶ ὥσπερ τὸ ὕδωρ τὸ καταφερόμενον ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, ὃ οὐ συναχθή-
σεται· καὶ λήψεται ὁ Θεὸς τὴν ψυχήν, καὶ διαλογιζόμενος λογι-
σμοὺς τοῦ [μὴ] ἐξῶσαι ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἐξωσμένον. Καὶ νῦν ὁ ἦλθον λαλῆσαι
15 πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα τὸν κύριόν μου, τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο, ὅτι ἔφεταί με
ὁ λαός, καὶ ἐρεῖ ἡ δούλη σου· λαλησάτω δὴ πρὸς τὸν
βασιλέα, εἴπως ποιήσει ὁ βασιλεὺς τὸ ῥῆμα τῆς δούλης αὐτοῦ,
16 ὅτι ἀκούσει ὁ βασιλεύς· ῥυσάσθω δὴ τὴν δούλην αὐτοῦ ἐκ χει-
ρὸς τοῦ ἀνδρὸς τοῦ ζητοῦντος ἐξᾶραί με καὶ τὸν υἱόν μου κατὰ
17 τὸ αὐτὸ ἀπὸ κληρονομίας Θεοῦ. Καὶ εἶπεν ἡ γυνή· εἴη δὴ ὁ
λόγος τοῦ κυρίου μου τοῦ βασιλέως εἰς θυσίαν· ὅτι καθώς ἄγγε-
λος τοῦ Θεοῦ, οὕτως ὁ κύριός μου ὁ βασιλεύς, τοῦ ἀκούειν τὸ
ἀγαθὸν καὶ τὸ πονηρόν· καὶ κύριος ὁ Θεός σου ἔσται μετά σου.
18 Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη ὁ βασιλεύς, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς τὴν γυναῖκα· μὴ δὴ κρύ-

### Chapter 14

**6** my husband. And thy handmaid had two sons, and they both strove together in the field, and there was none to part them. And the one smote his brother, and slew him.
**7** And behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid, and they have said, "Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may put him to death for the life of his brother whom he slew, and that we may destroy even our heir." So shall they quench my coal which is left, that there be not to my husband a name and a remnant upon the face of the earth.
**8** And the king said unto the woman, "Go in safety to thine house, and I will give charge concerning thee."
**9** And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, "Upon me, my lord, O king, be the iniquity, and upon my father's house; and the king and his throne shall be guiltless."
**10** And the king said, "Whosoever speaketh against thee, bring him unto me, and he shall not again touch thee."
**11** Then said she, "Let the king, I pray thee, remember the Lord thy God, that the avenger of blood do not multiply [destruction], and that they shall not destroy my son." And he said, "As the Lord liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth."
**12** Then said the woman, "Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak a word unto my lord the king."
**13** And he said, "Speak." And the woman said, "Wherefore then hast thou devised such a thing against the people of God? Or is it that out of the mouth of the king this word is as a trespass, that the king may not bring home his banished one?"
**14** For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; yet God doth take away the soul, and deviseth means that His banished one should [not] be cast out from Him.
**15** Now therefore, I am come to speak this word unto my lord the king, because the people did press upon me. And thine handmaid said, "Let me now speak unto the king, if peradventure the king will perform the word of his handmaid,"
**16** for the king will hear, and he shall deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that seeketh to destroy me and my son together from the inheritance of God.
**17** Then said the woman, "Let the word of my lord the king, I pray thee, be for a sacrifice; for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king, to discern the good and the evil: and the Lord thy God shall be with thee."
**18** Then the king answered and said unto the woman, "Hide it not from me, I pray thee,"
