ΠΑΡΑΛΕΙΠΟΜΕΝΩΝ ΚΕΦ. ΙϚʹ. ΙΖʹ.
7 ἤγαγε πάντα τὸν Ἰούδαν, καὶ ἔλαβε τοὺς λίθους τῆς Ῥαμὰ καὶ
    τὰ ξύλα αὐτῆς, ἃ ᾠκοδόμησε Βαασά, καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν ἐν αὐτοῖς
    τὴν Γαβαὲ καὶ τὴν Μασφά. Καὶ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ ἦλθεν Ἀνα-
    νὶ ὁ προφήτης πρὸς βασιλέα Ἰούδα Ἀσά, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· ἐν τῷ
    πεποιθέναι σε ἐπὶ βασιλέα Συρίας, καὶ μὴ πεποιθέναι σε ἐπὶ Κύ-
    ριον Θεόν σου, διὰ τοῦτο ἐσώθη ἡ δύναμις Συρίας ἀπὸ τῆς χειρός
8 σου. Οὐχ οἱ Αἰθίοπες καὶ Λίβυες ἦσαν ἐν δύναμιν πολλήν, εἰς
    θάρσος, εἰς ἱππεῖς, εἰς πλῆθος σφόδρα; καὶ ἐν τῷ πεποιθέναι σε
9 ἐπὶ Κύριον παρέδωκεν εἰς τὰς χεῖράς σου; Ὅτι οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ Κυ-
    ρίου ἐπιβλέπουσιν ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ, κατισχύσαι ἐν πάσῃ καρδίᾳ πλή-
    ρει πρὸς αὐτόν. Καὶ νῦν ἠγνόηκας ἐπὶ τούτῳ, ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν ἔσται
10 μετὰ σοῦ πόλεμος. Καὶ ἐθυμώθη Ἀσὰ τῷ προφήτῃ, καὶ παρέθε-
    το αὐτὸν εἰς φυλακήν, ὅτι ὠργίσθη ἐπὶ τούτῳ· καὶ ἐλυμήνατο
11 Ἀσὰ ἐν τῷ λαῷ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ. Καὶ ἰδοὺ οἱ λόγοι Ἀσά, οἱ
    πρῶτοι καὶ οἱ ἔσχατοι, γεγραμμένοι ἐν βιβλίῳ βασιλέων Ἰούδα
12 καὶ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἐμαλακίσθη Ἀσὰ ἐν τῷ ἐνάτῳ καὶ τριακοστῷ
    ἔτει τῆς βασιλείας ἑαυτοῦ τοὺς πόδας, ἕως σφόδρα ἐμαλακίσθη·
    καὶ ἐν τῇ μαλακίᾳ ἑαυτοῦ οὐκ ἐξεζήτησε τὸν Κύριον, ἀλλὰ τοὺς
13 ἰατρούς. Καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Ἀσὰ μετὰ τῶν πατέρων ἑαυτοῦ, καὶ ἐτε-
    λεύτησεν ἐν τῷ τεσσαρακοστῷ καὶ ἑνὶ ἔτει τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ.
14 Καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν ἐν τῷ μνήματι, ᾧ ὤρυξεν ἑαυτῷ ἐν πόλει
    Δαυίδ, καὶ ἐκοίμισαν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τῆς κλίνης, καὶ ἐπλήρωσαν ἀρω-
    μάτων, καὶ γένη μύρων μυρεψῶν, καὶ ἐποίησαν αὐτῷ ἐκφορὰν με-
    γάλην ἕως σφόδρα.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐβασίλευσεν Ἰωσαφὰτ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ κατ-
2 ίσχυσεν Ἰωσαφὰτ ἐπὶ τὸν Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἔδωκε δύναμιν ἐν πάσαις
    ταῖς πόλεσιν Ἰούδα ταῖς ὀχυραῖς, καὶ κατέστησεν ἡγουμένους ἐν
    πάσαις ταῖς πόλεσιν Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐν πόλεσιν Ἐφραίμ, ἃς προκα-
3 τελάβeto Ἀσὰ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐγένετο Κύριος μετὰ Ἰωσα-
    φάτ, ὅτι ἐπορεύθη ἐν ὁδοῖς τοῦ πατρὸς ἑαυτοῦ ταῖς πρώταις, καὶ
4 οὐκ ἐξεζήτησε τὰ εἴδωλα, ἀλλὰ Κύριον τὸν Θεὸν τοῦ πατρὸς
    ἑαυτοῦ ἐξεζήτησε, καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἐντολαῖς τοῦ πατρὸς ἑαυτοῦ ἐπορεύ-
5 θη, καὶ οὐχ ὡς τῷ Ἰσραὴλ τὰ ἔργα. Καὶ κατηύθυνε Κύριος τὴν

**Chapter 16**

⁷Then Asa the king led forth all Judah, and they took the stones of Ramah and the timbers thereof, which Baasha had built; and with them he built Geba and Mizpah. And in that selfsame time, Hanani the prophet came unto Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, "Forasmuch as thou hast put thy trust in the king of Syria, and hast not put thy trust in the Lord thy God, therefore hath the host of Syria escaped out of thy hand.
⁸Were not the Ethiopians and the Libyans a mighty host, in great power, [even] for their boldness, and for their horsemen, and for an exceeding multitude? Yet when thou didst put thy trust in the Lord, He delivered them into thine hand.
⁹For the eyes of the Lord sweep through all the earth, to strengthen every heart that is perfect toward Him. In this matter hast thou acted foolishly; therefore from this time forth, war shall be against thee."
¹⁰Then Asa was wroth with the prophet, and cast him into prison; for he was enraged at this thing. And Asa oppressed certain of the people at that time.
¹¹Now behold, the acts of Asa, the first and the last, lo, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
¹²And Asa became diseased in his feet in the thirty and ninth year of his reign, until he was exceedingly diseased. And in his infirmity, he sought not the Lord, but rather the physicians.
¹³And Asa slept with his fathers, and he died in the forty and first year of his reign.
¹⁴And they buried him in the sepulchre which he had hewn for himself in the City of David. And they laid him upon the bier, and filled it with aromatics and sundry kinds of the perfumers' compounds, and they made for him an exceedingly great burning.

**Chapter 17**

¹And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead. And Jehoshaphat prevailed against Israel.
²And he placed garrisons in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set governors in all the cities of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had previously seized.
³And the Lord was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the former ways of Asa his father, and sought not after idols,
⁴But he sought the Lord God of his father, and walked in the commandments of his father, and not after the works of Israel.
⁵And the Lord established the kingdom...
