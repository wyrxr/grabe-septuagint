μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐκόψαντο, καὶ ἔκλαυσαν, καὶ ἐνήστευσαν ἕως 12
δείλης ἐπὶ Σαοὺλ, καὶ ἐπὶ Ἰωνάθαν τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν λαὸν
Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον Ἰσραήλ, ὅτι ἐπλήγησαν ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ.
Καὶ εἶπε Δαυὶδ τῷ παιδαρίῳ τῷ ἀπαγγέλλοντι αὐτῷ· πόθεν εἶ 13
σύ; καὶ εἶπεν· υἱὸς ἀνδρὸς παροίκου Ἀμαληκίτου ἐγώ εἰμι. Καὶ 14
εἶπεν αὐτῷ Δαυὶδ· πῶς οὐκ ἐφοβήθης ἐπενεγκεῖν χεῖρά σου δια-
φθεῖραι τὸν χριστὸν Κυρίου; Καὶ ἐκάλεσε Δαυὶδ ἓν τῶν παιδα- 15
ρίων αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπε· προσελθὼν ἀπάντησον αὐτῷ. Καὶ ἐπάτα-
ξεν αὐτὸν, καὶ ἀπέθανε. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτὸν Δαυὶδ· τὸ αἷμά 16
σου ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλήν σου, ὅτι τὸ στόμα σου ἀπεκρίθη κατὰ σοῦ,
λέγον, ὅτι ἐγὼ ἐθανάτωσα τὸν χριστὸν Κυρίου. Καὶ ἐθρήνησε 17
Δαυὶδ τὸν θρῆνον τοῦτον ἐπὶ Σαοὺλ καὶ ἐπὶ Ἰωνάθαν τὸν υἱὸν αὐ-
τοῦ, καὶ εἶπε τοῦ διδάξαι τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰούδα τόξον· ἰδοὺ γέγρα- 18
πται ἐπὶ βιβλίου τοῦ εὐθοῦς. Στήλωσον Ἰσραὴλ (ἐπὶ τὰ ὕψη σου) 19
περὶ τεθνηκότων σου τραυματιῶν· πῶς ἔπεσαν δυνατοί; Μὴ ἀναγ- 20
γείλητε ἐν Γὲθ, καὶ μὴ εὐαγγελίσησθε ἐν ταῖς ἐξόδοις Ἀσκά-
λωνος, μή ποτε εὐφρανθῶσι θυγατέρες ἀλλοφύλων, μή ποτε ἀγαλ-
λιάσωνται θυγατέρες τῶν ἀπεριτμήτων. Ὄρη τὰ ἐν Γελβουέ, μὴ 21
καταβήτω δρόσος μηδὲ ὑετὸς πέσοι ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς· καὶ ἀγροὶ ἀπαρ-
χῶν, ὅτι ἐκεῖ προσωχθίσθη θυρεὸς δυνατῶν· θυρεὸς Σαοὺλ οὐκ
ἐχρίσθη ἐν ἐλαίῳ. Ἀφ᾿ αἵματος τραυματιῶν, ἀπὸ στέατος δυνα- 22
τῶν, τόξον Ἰωνάθαν οὐκ ἀπεστράφη κενὸν εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω, καὶ ῥομ-
φαία Σαοὺλ οὐκ ἀνέκαμψε κενή. Σαοὺλ καὶ Ἰωνάθαν οἱ ἠγαπη- 23
μένοι καὶ ὡραῖοι οὐ διακεχωρισμένοι, εὐπρεπεῖς ἐν τῇ ζωῇ αὐτῶν,
καὶ ἐν τῷ θανάτῳ αὐτῶν οὐ διεχωρίσθησαν· ὑπὲρ ἀετοὺς κοῦ-
φοι, καὶ ὑπὲρ λέοντα ἐκραταιώθησαν. Θυγατέρες Ἰσραὴλ ἐπὶ Σα- 24
οὺλ κλαύσατε, τὸν ἐνδιδύσκοντα ὑμᾶς κόκκινα μετὰ κόσμου ὑμῶν,
τὸν ἀναφέροντα κόσμον χρύσεον ἐπὶ τὰ ἐνδύματα ὑμῶν. Πῶς ἔ- 25
πεσαν δυνατοὶ ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ πολέμου, Ἰωνάθαν ἐπὶ τὰ ὕψη σου
τραυματίας; Ἀλγῶ ἐπὶ σοὶ, ἀδελφέ μου Ἰωνάθαν, ὡραιώθης μοι 26
σφόδρα, ἐθαυμαστώθη ἡ ἀγάπησίς σου ἐμοὶ ὑπὲρ ἀγάπην γυναι-
κῶν. Πῶς ἔπεσαν δυνατοὶ, καὶ ἀπώλοντο σκεύη πολεμικά; } 27

**12** with him. And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until the evening, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Judah, and for the house of Israel, because they were smitten by the sword.
**13** And David said unto the young man that told him, "Whence comest thou?" And he answered, "I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite."
**14** And David said unto him, "How wast thou not afraid to lay thine hand to destroy the anointed of the Lord?"
**15** Then David called one of his young men, and said, "Go near, [and] fall upon him." And he smote him, and he died.
**16** And David said unto him, "Thy blood [be] upon thine own head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, 'I have slain the anointed of the Lord.'"
**17** And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son;
**18** and he commanded to teach the children of Judah the bow. Behold, it is written in the book of the Upright.
**19** O Israel, set forth [the memorial] (upon thy high places) concerning thy wounded and thy dead! How are the mighty fallen!
**20** Tell it not in Gath, neither publish it in the streets of Ashkelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
**21** Ye mountains of Gilboa, let no dew nor rain fall upon you; neither [let there be] fields of offerings; for there was cast away the shield of the mighty, the shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.
**22** From the blood of the wounded, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back empty, and the sword of Saul returned not void.
**23** Saul and Jonathan, the beloved and the beautiful, not separated, comely in their life, and in their death they were not parted; they were swifter than eagles, and stronger than lions.
**24** Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with [your] adornments, who brought up golden ornaments upon your garments.
**25** How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan, wounded upon thy high places!
**26** I am pained for thee, my brother Jonathan; exceedingly fair wast thou unto me. Thy love for me was wonderful, [surpassing] the love of women.
**27** How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!
