ΚΕΦ. ΚΘ´. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΝ ΙΟΥΔΑ Α´.
...ἐπὶ παντὸς βασιλέως ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ.
`26` Καὶ Δαυὶδ υἱὸς Ἰεσσαὶ ἐβασίλευσεν ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ, ἔτη τεσσαράκοντα,
`27` ἐν Χεβρὼν ἔτη ἑπτὰ, καὶ ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἔτη τριακοντατρία.
`28` Καὶ ἐτελεύτησεν ἐν γήρει καλῷ, πλήρης ἡμερῶν, πλούτῳ καὶ δόξῃ, καὶ ἐβασίλευσε Σαλωμὼν υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ.
`29` Οἱ δὲ λοιποὶ λόγοι τοῦ βασιλέως Δαυὶδ οἱ πρότεροι καὶ οἱ ὕστεροι, γεγραμμένοι εἰσὶν ἐν λόγοις Σαμουὴλ τοῦ
`30` βλέποντος, καὶ ἐπὶ λόγων Νάθαν τοῦ προφήτου, καὶ ἐπὶ λόγων Γὰδ τοῦ βλέποντος, περὶ πάσης τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ, καὶ τῆς δυναστείας αὐτοῦ, καὶ οἱ καιροὶ οἳ ἐγένοντο ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐπὶ πάσας βασιλείας τῆς γῆς.

Παραλειπομένων τῶν βασιλειῶν Ἰούδα α´ τέλος.

`25` ...[king] before him.
`26` And David the son of Jesse reigned over Israel forty years:
`27` Seven years he reigned in Hebron, and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.
`28` And he died in a good old age, full of days, [abounding] in wealth and glory. And Solomon his son reigned in his stead.
`29` Now the rest of the chronicles of King David, the former and the latter,
`30` are recorded in the chronicles of Samuel the Seer, and in the chronicles of Nathan the Prophet, and in the chronicles of Gad the Seer; concerning all his kingship and his dominion, and the times which befell him, and upon Israel, and upon all the kingdoms of the earth.

Here ends the First Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah.
