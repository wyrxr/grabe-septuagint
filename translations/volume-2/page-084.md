τοῦ, οὕτω ποιήσει ὁ δοῦλός σου. Καὶ Μεμφιβοσθαὶ ἤσθιεν ἐπὶ τῆς
**12** τραπέζης Δαυὶδ καθὼς εἷς τῶν υἱῶν τοῦ βασιλέως. Καὶ τῷ Μεμ-

κατώκει ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, ὅτι ἐπὶ τῆς τραπέζης τοῦ βασιλέως αὐ-
τὸς ἤσθιε διαπαντὸς· καὶ αὐτὸς ἦν χωλὸς ἀμφοτέροις τοῖς πο-
σὶν αὐτοῦ.

**ΚΕΦ. Ι΄. Χ.**

**1** Καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ ταῦτα καὶ ἀπέθανε βασιλεὺς υἱῶν Ἀμμὼν
**2** καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Ἀνὼν υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπε Δαυὶδ·
ποιήσω ἔλεος μετὰ Ἀνὼν υἱοῦ Ναάς, ὃν τρόπον ἐποίησεν ὁ πα-
τὴρ αὐτοῦ μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ ἔλεος. Καὶ ἀπέστειλε Δαυὶδ παρακαλέσαι
αὐτὸν ἐν χειρὶ τῶν δούλων αὐτοῦ περὶ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ· καὶ
**3** παρεγένοντο οἱ παῖδες Δαυὶδ εἰς τὴν γῆν υἱῶν Ἀμμών. Καὶ
εἶπον ἄρχοντες υἱῶν Ἀμμὼν πρὸς Ἀνὼν τὸν κύριον αὐτῶν· μὴ
παρὰ τὸ δοξάζειν Δαυὶδ τὸν πατέρα σου ἐνώπιόν σου, ὅτι ἀπέ-
στειλέ σοι παρακαλοῦντας; οὐχ ἵνα ἐρευνήσωσι τὴν πόλιν καὶ κατα-
σκοπήσωσι αὐτὴν καὶ τοῦ κατασκευάσθαι αὐτὴν ἀπέστειλε
**4** Δαυὶδ τοὺς παῖδας αὐτοῦ πρὸς σέ; Καὶ ἔλαβεν Ἀνὼν τοὺς
παῖδας Δαυὶδ, καὶ ἐξύρησε τοὺς πώγωνας αὐτῶν, καὶ ἀπέ-
κοψε τοὺς μανδύας αὐτῶν ἐν τῷ ἡμίσει ἕως τῶν ἰσχίων αὐ-
**5** τῶν, καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν αὐτούς. Καὶ ἀνήγγειλαν τῷ Δαυὶδ ὑπὲρ
τῶν ἀνδρῶν, καὶ ἀπέστειλεν εἰς ἀπάντησιν αὐτῶν, ὅτι ἦσαν οἱ ἄν-
δρες ἠτιμασμένοι σφόδρα. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεύς· καθίσατε ἐν
Ἱεριχὼ ἔως τοῦ ἀνατεῖλαι τοὺς πώγωνας ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐπιστραφήσεσθε.
**6** Καὶ εἶδον οἱ υἱοὶ Ἀμμὼν ὅτι κατησχύνθη ὁ λαὸς ἐν Δαυίδ.
Καὶ ἀπέστειλαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἀμμὼν, καὶ ἐμισθώσαντο τὴν Συρίαν Βαι-
θροὼβ, καὶ τὴν Συρίαν Σουβὰ, εἴκοσι χιλιάδας πεζῶν, καὶ τὸν βα-
λέα Μααχὰ χιλίους ἄνδρας, καὶ Ἰστὼβ δώδεκα χιλιάδας ἀνδρῶν.
**7** Καὶ ἤκουσε Δαυὶδ, καὶ ἀπέστειλε τὸν Ἰωὰβ καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν δύνα-
**8** μιν, τοὺς δυνατούς. Καὶ ἐξῆλθον οἱ υἱοὶ Ἀμμὼν καὶ παρετάξαντο
πόλεμον παρὰ τῇ θύρᾳ τῆς πύλης· Συρία Σουβὰ, καὶ Ῥοώβ, καὶ
**9** Ἰστὼβ, καὶ Μααχὰ, μόνοι ἐν ἀγρῷ. Καὶ εἶδεν Ἰωὰβ ὅτι ἐγε-
νήθη πρὸς αὐτὸν ἀντιπρόσωπον τοῦ πολέμου ἐκ τοῦ κατὰ πρόσω-

### Chapter 9

**11** …So shall thy servant do. And Memphibosthai did eat at the
**12** table of David, as one of the king's sons. Now Memphibosthai had a young son, whose name was Micha;
**13** and all the household of Siba were servants unto Memphibosthai. And Memphibosthai dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually at the king’s table; and he was lame in both his feet.

### Chapter 10

**1** And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died,
**2** and Hanon his son reigned in his stead. And David said, I will show kindness unto Hanon the son of Naas, according as his father showed kindness unto me. And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants concerning his father; and
**3** the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon. Then said the princes of the children of Ammon unto Hanon their lord, Doth David not make show of honoring thy father before thee, in that he hath sent thee comforters? Is it not rather that they might search the city, and spy it out, and prepare its destruction, that David hath sent his servants unto thee?
**4** And Hanon took the servants of David, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even unto their buttocks, and sent them away.
**5** And they told David concerning the men; and he sent to meet them, because the men were sorely dishonoured. And the king said, Abide ye in Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.
**6** And when the children of Ammon saw that the people were made odious unto David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-Rehob, and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and the king of Maachah a thousand men, and Istob twelve thousand men.
**7** And when David heard of it, he sent Joab and all the forces,
**8** even the mighty men. And the children of Ammon came out and set themselves in battle array at the entrance of the gate: and Syria of Zoba, and Rohob, and
**9** Istob, and Maachah, were by themselves in the field. And when Joab saw that the face of the battle was against him, from before
