ΚΕΦ. ΙΔʹ. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Αʹ. 505
3 ἱερεὺς τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐν Σηλὼμ αἴρων Ἐφοὺδ· καὶ ὁ λαὸς οὐκ ᾔδει
ὅτι πεπόρευται Ἰωνάθαν.
4 Καὶ ἀναμέσον τῆς διαβάσεως οὐ ἐζήτει Ἰωνάθαν διαβῆναι εἰς τὴν ὑπόστασιν τῶν ἀλλοφύλων, καὶ ὁδοὺς πέτρας ἐκ τούτου, καὶ ὁδοὺς πέτρας ἐκ τούτου· ὄνομα τῷ ἑνὶ Βασεὲς, καὶ ὄνομα τῷ ἄλλῳ Σεννά.
5 Ἡ ὁδὸς ἡ μία ἀπὸ βορρᾶ ἐρχομένῳ Μαχμὰς· καὶ ἡ ὁδὸς ἡ ἄλλη ἀπὸ νότου ἐρχομένῳ Γαβαέ.
6 Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰωνάθαν πρὸς τὸ παιδάριον τὸ αἴρον τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ· δεῦρο, διαβῶμεν εἰς Μασσὰβ τῶν ἀπεριτμήτων τούτων, εἴτι ποιήσαι Κύριος ἡμῖν, ὅτι οὐκ ἔστι τῷ Κυρίῳ συνεχομένῳ σώζειν ἐν πολλοῖς ἢ ἐν ὀλίγοις.
7 Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ αἴρων τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ· ποίηει πᾶν ὃ ἐὰν ἡ καρδία σου ἐκκλίνῃ. Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ μετὰ σοῦ, ὡς ἡ καρδία σου καρδία μου.
8 Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰωνάθαν· Ἰδοὺ ἡμεῖς διαβαίνομεν πρὸς τοὺς ἄνδρας, καὶ κατακυλισθήσομεθα πρὸς αὐτούς.
9 Ἐὰν τάδε εἴπωσι πρὸς ἡμᾶς, ἀπόστητε ἐκεῖ ἕως ἂν ἀπαγγείλωμεν ὑμῖν· καὶ στησόμεθα ἐφ᾿ ἑαυτοῖς, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἀναβῶμεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτούς.
10 Καὶ ἐὰν τάδε εἴπωσι πρὸς ἡμᾶς, ἀνάβητε πρὸς ἡμᾶς· καὶ ἀναβησόμεθα, ὅτι παραδέδωκεν αὐτοὺς Κύριος εἰς χεῖρας ἡμῶν· τοῦτο ἡμῖν τὸ σημεῖον.
11 Καὶ εἰσῆλθον ἀμφότεροι εἰς Μεσσὰβ τῶν ἀλλοφύλων· καὶ λέγουσιν οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι· ἰδοὺ οἱ Ἑβραῖοι ἐκπορεύονται ἐκ τῶν τρωγλῶν αὐτῶν, οὗ ἐκρύβησαν ἐκεῖ.
12 Καὶ ἀπεκρίθησαν οἱ ἄνδρες τῆς Μεσσὰβ πρὸς Ἰωνάθαν καὶ πρὸς τὸν αἴροντα τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ, καὶ λέγουσιν· ἀνάβητε πρὸς ἡμᾶς, καὶ γνωριοῦμεν ὑμῖν ῥῆμα. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰωνάθαν πρὸς τὸν αἴροντα τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ· ἀνάβηθι ὀπίσω μου, ὅτι παρέδωκεν αὐτοὺς Κύριος εἰς τὰς χεῖρας Ἰσραήλ·
13 καὶ ἀνέβη Ἰωνάθαν ἐπὶ τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὁ αἴρων τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐπέβλεψαν κατὰ πρόσωπον Ἰωνάθαν, καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτοὺς· καὶ ὁ αἴρων τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ ἐπεδίδου ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ.
14 Καὶ ἐγενήθη ἡ πληγὴ ἡ πρώτη ἣν ἐπάταξεν Ἰωνάθαν καὶ ὁ αἴρων τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ, ὡς εἴκοσιν ἄνδρας ἐν βολίσι καὶ ἐν πετροβόλοις καὶ ἐν κοχλάσι τοῦ πεδίου.
15 Καὶ ἐγενήθη ἔκστασις ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ καὶ ἐν ἀγρῷ· καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ὁ ἐν Μεσσάβ, καὶ οἱ διαφθείροντες ἐξέστησαν, καὶ αὐτοὶ οὐκ ἤθελον ποιεῖν καὶ ἐθάμβησεν ἡ γῆ, καὶ ἐγενήθη ἔκστασις παρὰ Κυρίου.
16 Καὶ ἴδον οἱ σκοποὶ τοῦ Σαοὺλ ἐν Γαβαὰ Βενιαμείν, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἡ παρεμβολὴ τεταραγμένη ἔνθεν καὶ ἔνθεν.
17 Καὶ εἶπε Σαοὺλ τῷ λαῷ τῷ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ· ἐπισκέψασθε δὴ, καὶ ἴδετε τίς πεπόρευται ἐξ ὑμῶν· καὶ

**CHAPTER 14**

3 ...the priest of God in Shiloh, wearing the Ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.
4 Now between the passes, where Jonathan sought not to go over unto the Philistines' garrison, there were rocky crags on this side and rocky crags on that side; the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other was Seneh.
5 The one path was from the north, coming toward Michmash; and the other path was from the south, coming toward Geba.
6 And Jonathan said unto the young man that bore his armor, "Come, let us go over unto this garrison of the uncircumcised. Peradventure the LORD will work for us, for it is not for the LORD, by being constrained, to save whether by many or by few."
7 And his armor-bearer said unto him, "Thou shalt do all whatsoever thine heart inclineth. Behold, I am with thee; as thy heart is, so is my heart."
8 Then said Jonathan, "Behold, we are going over unto these men, and we shall roll down before them.
9 If they say thus unto us, 'Tarry ye there until we announce [unto] you,' then we shall stand in our place, and we shall not go up unto them.
10 But if they say thus unto us, 'Come up unto us,' then we shall go up, for the LORD hath delivered them into our hands; and this shall be a sign unto us."
11 So both of them went over unto the Philistine outpost. And the Philistines said, "Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of their holes, where they had hid themselves there."
12 And the men of the outpost answered Jonathan and his armor-bearer, and they said, "Come up unto us, and we will show you a thing." And Jonathan said unto his armor-bearer, "Come up after me, for the LORD hath delivered them into the hands of Israel."
13 And Jonathan went up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armor-bearer after him. And they looked down upon Jonathan's face, and he smote them; and his armor-bearer did deliver [the blows] after him.
14 And the first slaughter which Jonathan and his armor-bearer made was about twenty men, [who fell] among darts and among stone-throwers and among the pebbles of the field.
15 And there was a panic in the camp and in the field, and all the people that were in the outpost, even the spoilers, were seized with terror, and they themselves desired not to act. And the earth quaked, and there was a panic from the LORD.
16 And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and behold, the camp was in disarray hither and thither.
17 And Saul said unto the people that were with him, "Search now, and see who is gone from among you." And
