ΚΕΦ. ΙΘʹ. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Δʹ. 701
Καὶ νῦν, Κύριε, ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν, σῶσον ἡμᾶς ἐκ χειρὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ 19
γνώσονται πᾶσαι αἱ βασιλεῖαι τῆς γῆς, ὅτι σὺ εἶ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς
μόνος. Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ἠσαΐας υἱὸς Ἀμμὼς πρὸς Ἑζεκίαν, λέ- 20
γων· τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τῶν δυνάμεων, Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ· ἃ
προσηύξω πρὸς με περὶ Σενναχηρεὶμ βασιλέως Ἀσσυρίων, ἤκουσα.
Οὗτος ὁ λόγος ὃν ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς αὐτόν· ἐξουδένωσέ σε, 21
καὶ ἐμυκτήρισέ σε παρθένος θυγάτηρ Σιών, ἐπὶ σὲ κεφαλὴν ἐκί-
νησε θυγάτηρ Ἱερουσαλήμ· τίνα ὠνείδισας, καὶ ἐβλασφήμησας; 22
Καὶ ἐπὶ τίνα ὕψωσας φωνήν, καὶ ἤρας εἰς ὕψος τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς
σου; εἰς τὸν ἅγιον τοῦ Ἰσραήλ· ἐν χειρὶ ἀγγέλων σου ὠνείδισας 23
Κύριον, καὶ εἶπας· ἐν τῷ πλήθει τῶν ἀρμάτων μου ἐγὼ ἀνέβην
εἰς ὕψος ὀρέων (μου), μηροὺς τοῦ Λιβάνου, καὶ ἔκοψα τὸ μέγε-
θος τῆς κέδρου αὐτοῦ, τὰ ἐκλεκτὰ κυπαρίσσων αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἰσῆλ-
θον εἰς Μελὸν τέλους αὐτοῦ, δρυμοῦ Καμήλου αὐτοῦ. Ἐγὼ ἔψυξα, 24
καὶ ἔπιον ὕδατα ἀλλότρια, καὶ ἐξηρήμωσα τῷ ἴχνει τοῦ ποδός
μου πάντας τοὺς ποταμοὺς περιοχῆς. Μὴ οὐκ ἤκουσας; ἀπὸ μα- 25
κρόθεν αὐτὴν ἐποίησα, (εἰς) ἀπὸ ἡμερῶν ἀρχῆθεν ἔπλασα αὐτήν,
καὶ νῦν ἤγαγον αὐτήν· καὶ ἐγενήθη εἰς ἐπάρσεις ἀποικεσιῶν μα-
χίμων πόλεις ὀχυράς. Καὶ οἱ ἐνοικοῦντες ἐν αὐταῖς ἠσθένησαν 26
τῇ χειρί, ἔπτυξαν καὶ κατησχύνθησαν, ἐγένοντο χόρτος ἀγροῦ, ἢ
χλωρὰ βοτάνη, ἢ χλόη δωμάτων, καὶ πάτημα ἀπέναντι ἐστηκό-
τος. Καὶ τὴν καθέδραν σου, καὶ τὴν ἔξοδόν σου, καὶ τὴν εἴσο- 27
δόν σου ἔγνων, καὶ τὸν θυμόν σου ἐπ᾽ ἐμέ, διὰ τὸ ὀργισθῆναί σε 28
ἐπ᾽ ἐμέ, καὶ τὸ στρηνός σου ἀνέβη ἐν τοῖς ὠσί μου· καὶ θήσω τὰ
ἀγκιστρά μου ἐν τοῖς μυκτήρσι σου, καὶ χαλινὸν ἐν τοῖς χείλεσί
σου, καὶ ἀποστρέψω σε ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ ᾗ ἦλθες ἐν αὐτῇ. Καὶ τοῦτό 29
σοι τὸ σημεῖον· φάγε τοῦτον τὸν ἐνιαυτὸν αὐτόματα, καὶ τῷ ἔτει
τῷ δευτέρῳ τὰ ἀνατέλλοντα, καὶ τῷ ἔτει τῷ τρίτῳ σπορά, καὶ
ἀμητός, καὶ φυτεία ἀμπελώνων, καὶ φάγεσθε τὸν καρπὸν αὐτῶν.
Καὶ προσθήσει τὸ διασεσωσμένον οἴκου Ἰούδα, τὸ ὑπολειφθέν, ῥί- 30
ζαν κάτω, καὶ ποιήσει καρπὸν ἄνω. Ὅτι ἐξ Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐξελεύ- 31
σεται κατάλειμμα, καὶ ἀνασωζόμενος ἐξ ὄρους Σιών. ὁ ζῆλος Κυ-
ρίου τῶν δυνάμεων ποιήσει τοῦτο. Οὐχ οὕτως; τάδε λέγει Κύριος 32
πρὸς βασιλέα Ἀσσυρίων· οὐκ εἰσελεύσεται εἰς τὴν πόλιν ταύτην,
καὶ οὐ τοξεύσει ἐκεῖ βέλος, καὶ οὐ προφθάσει αὐτὴν θυρεός, καὶ οὐ
μὴ ἐκχέῃ πρὸς αὐτὴν πρόχωμα· τῇ ὁδῷ ᾗ ἦλθεν, ἐν αὐτῇ ἀπο- 33
στραφήσεται, καὶ τὴν πόλιν ταύτην οὐκ εἰσελεύσεται, λέγει Κύριος.

### Literary Translation:

### 2 Kings 19

**19** And now, O LORD our God, save us, we beseech Thee, from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that Thou art the LORD God alone.
**20** Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, "Thus saith the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel: 'I have heard that which thou hast prayed unto Me concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria.
**21** This is the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning him: "The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised thee and scorned thee; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.
**22** Whom hast thou reproached, and whom hast thou blasphemed? And against whom hast thou lifted up thy voice, and raised thine eyes on high? Even against the Holy One of Israel.
**23** By the hand of thy messengers hast thou reproached the LORD, and hast said, 'With the multitude of my chariots, I have ascended to the height of my mountains, [even] to the sides of Lebanon; and I have cut down the tallness of its cedars, the choicest of its cypresses; and I have entered into the Melon of its end, [even] the forest of its Carmel.
**24** I myself have dug and drunk foreign waters; and with the sole of my foot have I dried up all the rivers of the region.'
**25** Hast thou not heard that long ago I did it; [yea], from the days of old I formed it? And now have I brought it to pass, that fortified cities should become exalted heaps of desolate dwellings.
**26** And the inhabitants thereof were weakened in their hand; they were dismayed and put to shame; they became as the grass of the field, or the green herb, or the grass of the rooftops, and a trampling underfoot before that which stands [firm].
**27** And I know thy dwelling, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against Me.
**28** Because thou art wroth against Me, and thy insolence is come up into Mine ears, therefore will I put My hook in thy nose, and My bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.
**29** And this shall be a sign unto thee: Ye shall eat this year that which groweth of itself, and in the second year that which springs forth, and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.
**30** And the preserved remnant of the house of Judah, that which is left, shall put forth root downward, and shall bear fruit upward.
**31** For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of Mount Zion. The zeal of the LORD of hosts shall perform this.
**32** Not so! Thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria: "He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor shall the shield prevent its approach, nor cast up a mound against it.
**33** By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and into this city shall he not come," saith the LORD.'
