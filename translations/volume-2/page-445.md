ποὺς μου· ἵστα με γὰρ ἐν ζυγῷ δικαίῳ, οἶδε δὲ ὁ Κύριος τὴν 6
ἀκακίαν μου. Εἰ ἐξέκλινεν ὁ ποὺς μου ἀπὸ τῆς ὁδοῦ (αὐτοῦ), εἰ 7
δὲ καὶ τῷ ὀφθαλμῷ μου ἐπηκολούθησεν ἡ καρδία μου, καὶ εἰ ἐν
ταῖς χερσὶ μου ἥψαμην δώρων· σπείραιμι ἄρα, καὶ ἄλλοι φάγοισαν, 8
ἀῤῥίζος δὲ γενοίμην ἐπὶ γῆς. Εἰ ἐπηκολούθησεν ἡ καρδία μου γυ- 9
ναικὶ (ἀνδρὸς) ἑταίρου· εἰ (δὲ) καὶ ἔγκαθετος ἐγενόμην ἐπὶ θύραις 10
αὐτῆς· ἀλέσαι ἄρα καὶ ἡ γυνή μου ἄλλῳ, τὰ δὲ νήπιά μου ταπει- 11
νωθείη. Θυμὸς γὰρ ὀργῆς ἀκάθεκτος, τὸ μιᾶναι ἀνδρὸς γυναῖκα· 12
καὶ πῦρ γάρ ἐστι καιόμενον ἐπὶ πάντων τῶν ἡμερῶν· οὐ δ᾽ ἂν 13
ἐπέλθῃ, ἐκ ῥιζῶν ἀπώλεσεν. Εἰ δὲ καὶ ἐφαύλισα κρῖμα θεράπον- 14

σω, ἐὰν ἔτασίν μου ποιήσῃ ὁ Κύριος; ἐὰν δὲ καὶ ἐπισκοπήν, τίνα 16
ἀπόκρισιν ποιήσομαι; Πότερον οὐχ ὡς ἐγὼ ἐγενόμην ἐν γαστρί, 17
καὶ ἐκεῖνοι γεγόνασι; γεγόναμεν δὲ ἐν τῇ αὐτῇ κοιλίᾳ. Ἀδύνατοι 18
δὲ ἣν ποτε εἶχον χρείαν, οὐκ ἀπέτυχον, καὶ χήρας τὸν ὀφθαλμὸν 19
οὐκ ἔτηξα. Εἰ δὲ καὶ τὸν ψωμόν μου ἔφαγον μόνος, καὶ οὐχὶ 20
μετέδωκα ὀρφανῷ ἐξ αὐτοῦ· ὅτι ἐκ νεότητός μου ἐξέτρεφον 21
ὡς πατήρ, καὶ ἐκ γαστρὸς μητρός μου ὡδήγησα· εἰ δὲ καὶ ὑπερεῖδον 22
γυμνὸν ἀπολλύμενον, καὶ οὐκ ἠμφίασα· ἀδύνατοι δὲ εἰ μὴ 23
εὐλόγουν με, ἀπὸ δὲ κουρᾶς ἀρνῶν μου ἐθερμάνθησαν οἱ ὦμοι αὐ- 24
τῶν· εἰ (δὲ καὶ) ἐπῆρα ὀρφανῷ χειρά μου, πεποιθὼς ὅτι πολλή μοι 25
βοήθεια πάρεστιν· ἀποσταίη ἄρα ἀπὸ τῆς κλειδὸς ὁ ὦμός μου, ὁ 26
δὲ βραχίων μου ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀγκῶνος μου συντριβείη. Φόβος γὰρ Κυρίου 27
συνείχε με· καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ λήμματος αὐτοῦ οὐχ ὑποίσω. Εἰ ἔταξα 28
χρυσίον ἰσχύν μου, εἰ δὲ καὶ λίθῳ πολυτελεῖ ἐπεποίθησα, εἰ δὲ 29
καὶ εὐφράνθην πολλοῦ πλούτου γενομένου μοι, καὶ εἰ ἐπ᾽ ἀναριθμήτοις 30
ἐθέμην χειρά μου· (ἢ οὐχ ὁρῶ μὲν ἥλιον τὸν ἐπιφαύσκοντα (καὶ) 31
ἐκλείποντα, σελήνην δὲ φθίνουσαν, οὐ γὰρ ἐπ᾽ αὐτοῖς ἐστι) καὶ εἰ
ἠπατήθη λάθρα ἡ καρδία μου, εἰ δὲ (καὶ) χειρά μου ἐπιθεὶς ἐπὶ
στόματί μου ἐφίλησα· καὶ τοῦτό μοι ἄρα ἀνομία λογισθείη μεγάλη, 32
ὅτι ἐψεύσαμην ἔναντι Κυρίου τοῦ ὑψίστου. Εἰ δὲ καὶ ἐπιχαρὴς 33
ἐγενόμην ἐπὶ πτώματι ἐχθροῦ μου, καὶ εἰ εἶπεν ἡ καρδία μου, εὖγε,
εὖγε· ἀκοῦσαι ἄρα τὸ οὖς μου τὴν κατάραν μου, θρυλληθείην δὲ 34
ὑπὸ λαοῦ μου κακούμενος. Εἰ δὲ καὶ πολλάκις εἶπον αἱ θεράπαιναι 35
μου, τίς ἂν δώῃ ἡμῖν τῶν σαρκῶν αὐτοῦ οὐ πλησθῆναι; λίαν μου
χρηστοῦ ὄντος. Ἔξω δὲ οὐκ ἠυλίζετο

## CHAPTER XXXI.

...my foot; for He hath set me in a just balance, and the Lord knoweth my blamelessness.
**6** If my foot hath turned aside from His way,
**7** or if my heart hath followed mine eye, and if in my hands I have touched gifts;
**8** then let me sow, and let others eat, and let me become uprooted from the earth.
**9** If my heart hath followed a woman, the wife of another man;
**10** or if I became an [ambusher] at her doors;
**11** then let my wife grind for another, and let my infants be humbled.
**12** For it is a wrath of uncontrolled anger, to defile a man’s wife;
**13** and for it is a fire burning upon all days; and if it come upon [one], it hath destroyed from the roots.
**14** But if I have despised the right of my servant or my maidservant, when they contended with me;
**15** for what shall I do when the Lord shall make an examination of me? And if He make a visitation, what answer shall I make?
**16** Did not I come into being in the womb, as they also came into being? And we were made in the same belly.
**17** And the helpless, when they had need, they failed not [to find help],
**18** and I did not cause the eye of the widow to melt [with weeping].
**19** If also I ate my morsel alone, and did not share of it with the orphan;
**20** for from my youth did I nourish [them] as a father, and from my mother’s womb did I guide [them].
**21** And if I overlooked a naked man perishing, and did not clothe [him];
**22** and the helpless, if they did not bless me, and from the shearing of my lambs their shoulders were warmed;
**23** if (also) I lifted my hand against an orphan, trusting that much help was present for me;
**24** then let my shoulder depart from its collarbone, and let my arm be broken from my elbow.
**25** For the fear of the Lord held me fast; and from His retribution shall I not endure.
**26** If I made gold my strength, or if I trusted in a precious stone;
**27** or if I rejoiced when much wealth came unto me, and if I laid my hand upon countless [possessions];
**28** (Or do I not indeed see the sun shining and setting, and the moon waning, for it is not upon them [any power]); and if my heart was secretly deceived, or if, laying my hand upon my mouth, I kissed [it];
**29** then that also would be reckoned to me as a great iniquity, because I lied before the Lord Most High.
**30** And if I rejoiced over the downfall of my enemy, or if my heart said, 'Well done, well done!'
**31** then let mine ear hear my curse, and let me be utterly disgraced by my people, being afflicted.
**32** And if my handmaids often said, 'Who would give us of his flesh, [and we would] not be filled?' —seeing that I was exceedingly kind.
**33** And no stranger did lodge abroad
