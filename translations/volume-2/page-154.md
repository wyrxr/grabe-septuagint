630 ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Γ΄. ΚΕΦ. ΙΒ΄.
ὡς ἔφυγεν ἐκ προσώπου τοῦ βασιλέως Σαλωμὼν, καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν
Ἱεροβοὰμ ἐξ Αἰγύπτου. Καὶ ἀπέστειλαν, καὶ ἐκάλεσαν αὐτόν·
καὶ ἦλθεν Ἱεροβοάμ, καὶ πᾶσα ἡ ἐκκλησία Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ
ἐλάλησεν ὁ λαὸς πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Ῥοβοὰμ, λέγοντες· Ὁ πατήρ
σου ἐβάρυνε τὸν κλοιὸν ἡμῶν, καὶ σὺ νῦν κούφισον ἀπὸ τῆς
δουλείας τοῦ πατρός σου τῆς σκληρᾶς, καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ κλοιοῦ αὐτοῦ
τοῦ βαρέως, οὗ ἔδωκεν ἐφ᾿ ἡμᾶς, καὶ δουλεύσομέν σοι. Καὶ εἶπε
πρὸς αὐτούς· Ἀπέλθετε ἕως τριῶν ἡμερῶν, καὶ ἀναστρέψατε
πρὸς μέ· καὶ ἀπῆλθον. Καὶ παρήγγειλεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ῥοβοὰμ
τοῖς πρεσβυτέροις, οἳ ἦσαν παρεστῶτες ἐνώπιον Σαλωμὼν τοῦ πατρὸς
αὐτοῦ, ἔτι ζῶντος αὐτοῦ, λέγων· πῶς ὑμεῖς βουλεύεσθε,
καὶ ἀποκριθῶ τῷ λαῷ τούτῳ λόγον; Καὶ ἐλάλησαν πρὸς αὐτὸν,
λέγοντες· εἰ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ταύτῃ ἔσῃ δοῦλος τῷ λαῷ τούτῳ, καὶ
δουλεύσεις αὐτοῖς, καὶ εὐίξεις αὐτοῖς, καὶ λαλήσεις αὐτοῖς λόγους
ἀγαθοὺς, καὶ ἔσονται σοι δοῦλοι πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας. Καὶ ἐγκατέλιπε
τὴν βουλὴν τῶν πρεσβυτέρων ἃ συνεβουλεύσαντο αὐτῷ,
καὶ συνεβουλεύσατο μετὰ τῶν παιδαρίων τῶν ἐκτραφέντων μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ,
τῶν παρεστηκότων πρὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς,
τί ὑμεῖς συμβουλεύετε; καὶ τί ἀποκριθῶ τῷ λαῷ τούτῳ, τοῖς λαλήσασι
πρὸς μέ, λεγόντων, κούφισον ἀπὸ τοῦ κλοιοῦ, οὗ ἔδωκεν
ὁ πατήρ σου ἐφ᾿ ἡμᾶς; Καὶ ἐλάλησαν πρὸς αὐτὸν τὰ παιδάρια
τὰ ἐκτραφέντα μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, οἱ παρεστηκότες πρὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ,
λέγοντες· τάδε λαλήσεις τῷ λαῷ τούτῳ, τοῖς λαλήσασι πρὸς σὲ,
λέγοντες· ὁ πατήρ σου ἐβάρυνε τὸν κλοιὸν ἡμῶν, καὶ σὺ νῦν κούφισον
ἀφ᾿ ἡμῶν, τάδε λαλήσεις πρὸς αὐτούς· ἡ μικρότης μου παχυτέρα
ὑπὲρ τὴν ὀσφῦν τοῦ πατρός μου. Καὶ νῦν ὁ πατήρ μου
ἐπεδάκνωσεν ὑμᾶς κλοιῷ βαρεῖ, κἀγὼ προσθήσω ἐπὶ τὸν κλοιὸν
ὑμῶν· ὁ πατήρ μου ἐπαίδευσεν ὑμᾶς ἐν μάστιξιν, ἐγὼ δὲ παιδεύσω
ὑμᾶς ἐν σκορπίοις. Καὶ παρεγένοντο πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα
Ῥοβοὰμ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τρίτῃ, καθότι ἐλάλησεν αὐτοῖς ὁ
βασιλεύς, λέγων· Ἀναστράφητε πρὸς μέ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τρίτῃ. Καὶ
ἀπεκρίθη ὁ βασιλεὺς πρὸς τὸν λαὸν σκληρά· καὶ ἐγκατέλιπε Ῥοβοὰμ
τὴν βουλὴν τῶν πρεσβυτέρων, ἃ συνεβουλεύσαντο αὐτῷ, Καὶ
ἐλάλησε πρὸς αὐτοὺς, καὶ συνελάλησε πρὸς αὐτοὺς κατὰ τὴν βουλὴν
τῶν παιδαρίων, λέγων· ὁ πατήρ μου ἐβάρυνε τὸν κλοιὸν ὑμῶν,
κἀγὼ προσθήσω ἐπὶ τὸν κλοιὸν ὑμῶν· ὁ πατήρ μου ἐπαίδευσεν

**3** Then they sent, and called him; and Jeroboam came, and all the congregation of Israel.
**4** And the people spake unto King Rehoboam, saying, Thy father made our yoke grievous, and thou now do thou lighten [us] from the harsh servitude of thy father, and from his heavy yoke which he did lay upon us, and we will serve thee.
**5** And he said unto them, Depart ye for yet three days, then return unto me. And the people departed.
**6** And King Rehoboam consulted with the elders, who had stood before Solomon his father while he was yet living, saying, How do ye counsel that I may give answer to this people?
**7** And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and be agreeable unto them, and speak good words to them, then they shall be thy servants for all days.
**8** But he forsook the counsel of the elders, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him.
**9** And he said unto them, What counsel do ye give? And what shall I answer to this people, who spake unto me, saying, Lighten [us] from the yoke which thy father did lay upon us?
**10** And the young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him, spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people, who spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke grievous, and thou now make [it] lighter for us; thus shalt thou speak unto them, My little finger is thicker than my father's loins.
