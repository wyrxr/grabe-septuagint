οὐθέν· ἐν δὲ τῷ πυνθάνεσθαι τὸν βασιλέα περὶ τῆς εὐνοίας Μαρ- 4
δοχαίου, ἰδοὺ Ἀμὰν ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ. εἶπε δὲ ὁ βασιλεὺς· τίς ἐν τῇ
αὐλῇ; ὁ δὲ Ἀμὰν εἰσῆλθεν εἰπεῖν τῷ βασιλεῖ, κρεμάσαι τὸν Μαρ-
δοχαῖον ἐπὶ τῷ ξύλῳ, ᾧ ἡτοίμασε. Καὶ εἶπον οἱ ἐκ τῆς διακο- 5
νίας τοῦ βασιλέως· ἰδοὺ Ἀμὰν ἔστηκεν ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ· καὶ εἶπεν ὁ
βασιλεὺς· καλέσατε αὐτόν. Εἶπε δὲ ὁ βασιλεὺς τῷ Ἀμὰν· τί ποιή- 6
σω τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ, ὃν ἐγὼ θέλω δοξάσαι; εἶπε δὲ ἐν ἑαυτῷ Ἀμὰν·
τίνα θέλει ὁ βασιλεὺς δοξάσαι εἰ μὴ ἐμέ; Εἶπε δὲ πρὸς τὸν βα- 7
σιλέα· ἄνθρωπον ὃν ὁ βασιλεὺς θέλει δοξάσαι, ἐνεγκάτωσαν οἱ 8
παῖδες τοῦ βασιλέως στολὴν βυσσίνην ἣν ὁ βασιλεὺς περιβάλλεται,
καὶ ἵππον ἐφ᾿ ὃν ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐπιβαίνει, καὶ δότω ἐνὶ τῶν φίλων 9
τοῦ βασιλέως τῶν ἐνδόξων, καὶ στολισάτω τὸν ἄνθρωπον ὃν ὁ βα-
σιλεὺς ἀγαπᾷ· καὶ ἀναβιβασάτω αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὸν ἵππον, καὶ κηρυσ-
σέτω διὰ τῆς πλατείας τῆς πόλεως, λέγων· οὕτως ἔσται παντὶ
ἀνθρώπῳ, ὃν ὁ βασιλεὺς δοξάζει. Εἶπε δὲ ὁ βασιλεὺς τῷ Ἀμὰν· 10
καλῶς ἐλάλησας· οὕτως ποίησον τῷ Μαρδοχαίῳ τῷ Ἰουδαίῳ, τῷ
θεραπεύοντι ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ, ὃν εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεύς, καὶ μὴ παραπεσά-
τω σου λόγος ὧν ἐλάλησας. Ἔλαβε δὲ Ἀμὰν τὴν στολὴν καὶ τὸν 11
ἵππον, καὶ ἐστόλισε τὸν Μαρδοχαῖον, καὶ ἀνεβίβασεν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ
τὸν ἵππον, καὶ διῆλθε διὰ τῆς πλατείας τῆς πόλεως, καὶ ἐκήρυσ-
σε λέγων· οὕτως ἔσται παντὶ ἀνθρώπῳ ὃν ὁ βασιλεὺς θέλει δοξά-
σαι. Ἐπέστρεψε δὲ ὁ Μαρδοχαῖος εἰς τὴν αὐλὴν· Ἀμὰν δὲ ὑπ- 12
έστρεψεν εἰς τὰ ἴδια λυπούμενος κατὰ κεφαλῆς. Καὶ διηγήσατο 13
Ἀμὰν τὰ συμβεβηκότα αὐτῷ Σωσάρα τῇ γυναικὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοῖς
φίλοις. καὶ εἶπον πρὸς αὐτὸν οἱ φίλοι, καὶ ἡ γυνὴ· εἰ ἐκ γένους
Ἰουδαίων Μαρδοχαῖος, ἤρξαι ταπεινοῦσθαι ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ, πεσὼν
πεσῇ, οὐ μὴ δύνη αὐτὸν ἀμύνασθαι, ὅτι ὁ Θεὸς ὁ ζῶν μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ.
Ἔτι αὐτῶν λαλούντων, παραγίνονται οἱ εὐνοῦχοι, ἐπισπεύδοντες 14
τὸν Ἀμὰν ἐπὶ τὸν πότον ὃν ἡτοίμασεν Ἐσθήρ.

ΚΕΦ. Ζʹ. VII.

ΕΙΣΗΛΘΕ δὲ ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ Ἀμὰν, συμπιεῖν τῇ βασιλίσ- 1
σῃ. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἐσθὴρ τῇ δευτέρᾳ ἡμέρᾳ ἐν τῷ πότῳ· 2
τί ἐστιν Ἐσθὴρ ἡ βασίλισσα; καὶ τί τὸ αἴτημά σου; καὶ τί τὸ
ἀξίωμά σου; καὶ ἔσται σοι ἕως τοῦ ἡμίσους τῆς βασιλείας μου.

### Chapter 6

4 nothing. Yet when the king made inquiry concerning the favor of Mordecai, behold, Haman was in the court. Then said the king, "Who is in the court?"

5 But Haman entered, meaning to tell the king, that he might hang Mordecai on the gallows which he had prepared. And the servants of the king answered him, saying, "Behold, Haman standeth in the court." Then the king said, "Call him."

6 And the king said unto Haman, "What shall be done unto the man whom I delight to honor?" Now Haman said in his heart, "Whom would the king delight to honor more than myself?"

7 Then said he unto the king, "For the man whom the king delighteth to honor,
8 let the king's servants bring forth the royal apparel, [even] the fine linen robe which the king himself doth wear,
9 and the horse that the king doth ride upon. And let [this] be delivered to one of the king's most noble friends, that he may array the man whom the king loveth; and let him cause him to ride upon the horse, and proclaim throughout the street of the city, saying, 'Thus shall it be done unto every man whom the king delighteth to honor!'"

10 Then the king said to Haman, "Thou hast spoken well; do even so unto Mordecai the Jew, who serveth in the court, of whom the king hath spoken, and let no word fail of all that thou hast spoken."

11 So Haman took the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and caused him to ride upon the horse, and went through the street of the city, and proclaimed, saying, "Thus shall it be done unto every man whom the king delighteth to honor!"

12 And Mordecai returned to the court; but Haman hastened to his own house, mourning and with his head covered [in shame].

13 And Haman recounted unto Zosara his wife and all his friends all that had befallen him. Then said his friends and Zosara his wife unto him, "If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him; for the Living God is with him."

14 And while they were yet speaking, came the king's chamberlains, and hastened Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared.

### Chapter 7

1 So the king and Haman came to drink with Esther the queen.

2 And the king said unto Esther on the second day at the wine banquet, "What is it, Queen Esther? and what is thy petition? and what is thy request? And it shall be granted unto thee, even to the half of my kingdom."
