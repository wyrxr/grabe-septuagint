6 ἔγνωσται Δαυίδ, καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες οἱ μετ’ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ Σαοὺλ ἐκάθητο ἐν τῷ βουνῷ ὑπὸ τὴν ἀρουραν τὴν ἐν Ῥαμᾷ, καὶ τὸ δόρυ ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντες οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ παρειστήκεισαν
7 αὐτῷ. Καὶ εἶπε Σαοὺλ πρὸς τοὺς παῖδας αὐτοῦ τοὺς παρεστηκότας αὐτῷ (καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς)· ᾿Ακούσατε δὴ υἱοὶ Ἰεμεινί, εἰ
8 ἀληθῶς πᾶσιν ὑμῖν δώσει ὁ υἱὸς Ἰεσσαὶ ἀγροὺς καὶ ἀμπελῶνας, καὶ πάντας ὑμᾶς τάξει χιλιάρχους καὶ ἑκατοντάρχους· ὅτι σύγκεισθε πάντες ὑμεῖς ἐπ’ ἐμέ, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἀποκαλύπτων τὸ ὠτίον μου, ἐν τῷ διαθέσθαι τὸν υἱόν μου διαθήκην μετὰ τοῦ υἱοῦ Ἰεσσαί, καὶ οὐκ ἔστι πονῶν ἐξ ὑμῶν περὶ ἐμοῦ, καὶ ἀποκαλύπτων
9 τὸ ὠτίον μου, ὅτι ἐπήγειρεν υἱός μου τὸν δοῦλόν μου ἐπ’ ἐμὲ εἰς ἐχθρόν, ὡς ἡ ἡμέρα αὕτη; Καὶ ἀποκρίνεται Δωὴκ ὁ Σύρος ὁ καθεστηκὼς ἐπὶ τὰς ἡμιόνους Σαούλ, καὶ εἶπεν· ἑώρακα τὸν υἱὸν Ἰεσσαὶ παραγινόμενον εἰς Νοβὰ πρὸς ᾿Αβιμέλεχ υἱὸν ᾿Αχιτὼβ τὸν
10 ἱερέα· καὶ ἠρώτα αὐτῷ διὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ ἐπισιτισμὸν ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ, καὶ τὴν ῥομφαίαν Γολιὰθ τοῦ ἀλλοφύλου ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ.
11 Καὶ ἀπέστειλε (Σαοὺλ) ὁ βασιλεὺς καλέσαι τὸν ᾿Αβιμέλεχ υἱὸν ᾿Αχιτὼβ τὸν ἱερέα καὶ πάντας τοὺς υἱοὺς τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ τοὺς ἱερεῖς (τοῦ Κυρίου) τοὺς ἐν Νοβάθ· καὶ παρεγένοντο πάντες πρὸς
12 τὸν βασιλέα· καὶ εἶπε Σαούλ· ἄκουε δὴ υἱὲ ᾿Αχιτώβ· καὶ εἶπεν· ἰδοὺ ἐγώ, λάλει Κύριε.
13 Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Σαούλ· ἵνατι συνέθου σὺ κατ’ ἐμοῦ καὶ ὁ υἱὸς Ἰεσσαὶ δοῦναι σε αὐτῷ ἄρτον, καὶ ῥομφαίαν, καὶ ἐπερωτᾶν αὐτῷ διὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ θέσθαι αὐτὸν ἐπ’ ἐμὲ εἰς ἐχθρόν,
14 ὡς ἡ ἡμέρα αὕτη; Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη ᾿Αχιμέλεχ τῷ βασιλεῖ, καὶ εἶπε· καὶ τίς ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς δούλοις σου ὡς Δαυὶδ πιστός, καὶ γαμβρὸς τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ ἄρχων παντὸς παραγγέλματός σου, καὶ
15 ἔνδοξος ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ σου; ἢ σήμερον ἤργμαι ἐρωτᾶν αὐτῷ διὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ; μηδαμῶς, μὴ δότω ὁ βασιλεὺς κατὰ δούλου αὐτοῦ λόγον, καὶ ἐφ’ ὅλον τὸν οἶκον τοῦ πατρός μου, ὅτι οὐκ ᾔδει ὁ δοῦλος ὁ
16 σὸς ἐν πᾶσι τούτοις ῥῆμα μικρόν, ἢ μέγα. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Σαούλ· θανάτῳ ἀποθανῇ, ᾿Αχιμέλεχ, σύ, καὶ πᾶς ὁ οἶκος τοῦ
17 πατρός σου. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τοῖς παρατρέχουσι τοῖς ἐφεστηκόσιν ἐπ’ αὐτῷ· προσαγάγετε καὶ θανατοῦτε τοὺς ἱερεῖς τοῦ Κυρίου, ὅτι ἡ χεὶρ αὐτῶν μετὰ Δαυίδ, καὶ ὅτι ἔγνωσαν ὅτι φεύγει αὐτός, καὶ οὐκ ἀπεκάλυψαν τὸ ὠτίον μου. Καὶ οὐκ ἐβουλήθησαν οἱ παῖδες τοῦ βασιλέως ἐπενεγκεῖν τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν ἀποκτεῖναι

**CHAPTER 22.**

**6** it was known that David [had come], and the men that were with him. And Saul sat on the hill beneath the cultivated field which was in Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants stood by him.
**7** And Saul said unto his servants that stood about him (and he spake unto them), "Hear now, ye sons of Jemini, if indeed
**8** the son of Jesse will give unto all of you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds? For ye are all leagued against me, and there is none that uncovereth my ear, when my son maketh a covenant with the son of Jesse; and there is none among you that grieveth concerning me, and uncovereth
**9** my ear, that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to be an enemy, as it is this day?" Then answered Doeg the Syrian, who was set over the mules of Saul, and said, "I have seen the son of Jesse coming to Nob unto Abimelech, the son of Ahitub, the
**10** priest; and he inquired of God for him, and gave him provisions, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine."
**11** And the king [Saul] sent to call Abimelech the son of Ahitub the priest, and all the sons of his father, the priests [of the Lord] that were in Nob; and they came all of them unto
**12** the king. And Saul said, "Hear now, son of Ahitub." And he answered, "Behold, here am I; speak, my lord."
**13** And Saul said unto him, "Wherefore have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou didst give him bread, and a sword, and didst inquire for him through God, that he should rise up against me as an enemy,
**14** as it is this day?" And Ahimelech answered the king, and said, "And who among all thy servants is so faithful as David, who is also the king's son-in-law, and the chief over all thy command, and
**15** honored in thine house? Or have I this day begun to inquire for him through God? God forbid! Let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor unto all the house of my father, for thy servant knew nothing,
**16** thy servant knew nothing of all these things, either small or great." Then said King Saul, "Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all the house of thy
**17** father." And the king said unto the runners who stood about him, "Draw nigh, and slay the priests of the Lord; for their hand is with David, and because they knew that he fled, and did not uncover my ear." But the servants of the king would not put forth their hands to slay
