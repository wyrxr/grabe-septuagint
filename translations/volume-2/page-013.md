κιβωτοῦ τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ ἔπεσεν ἀπὸ τοῦ δίφρου ὀπισθίως ἐχόμε-
νος τῆς πύλης, καὶ συνετρίβη δ νῶτος αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀπέθανεν, ὅτι
πρεσβύτης δ ἄνθρωπος καὶ βαρύς· καὶ αὐτὸς ἔκρινε τὸν Ἰσραὴλ
εἴκοσιν ἔτη. Καὶ νύμφη αὐτοῦ γυνὴ Φινεὲς συνειληφυῖα τοῦ τεκεῖν· 19
καὶ ἤκουσε τὴν ἀγγελίαν, ὅτι ἐλήφθη ἡ κιβωτὸς τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ
ὅτι τέθνηκεν ὁ πενθερὸς αὐτῆς καὶ ὁ ἀνὴρ αὐτῆς, καὶ ἔκλασε καὶ
ἔτεκεν, ὅτι ἐπεστράφησαν ἐπ᾽ αὐτὴν ὠδῖνες αὐτῆς· καὶ ἐν τῷ και- 20
ρῷ αὐτῆς ἀποθνήσκει. Καὶ εἶπον αὐτῇ αἱ γυναῖκες αἱ παρεστη-
κυῖαι αὐτῇ· μὴ φοβοῦ, ὅτι υἱὸν τέτοκας. Καὶ οὐκ ἀπεκρίθη, καὶ
οὐκ ἐνόησεν ἡ καρδία αὐτῆς. Καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸ παιδάριον Οὐαῖγα- 21
ἔθωδ, καὶ εἶπαν ὑπὲρ τῆς κιβωτοῦ τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ ὑπὲρ τοῦ πεν-
θεροῦ αὐτῆς, καὶ ὑπὲρ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς αὐτῆς· ἀπώχισται δόξα ἀπὸ
Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τῷ ληφθῆναι τὴν κιβωτὸν Κυρίου, καὶ διὰ τὸ τεθνη-
κέναι τὸν πενθερὸν αὐτῆς, καὶ τὸν ἄνδρα αὐτῆς. Καὶ εἶπεν· ἀπώ- 22
κισται δόξα ἀπὸ Ἰσραὴλ, ὅτι ἐλήφθη ἡ κιβωτὸς τοῦ Θεοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. Εʹ. V.

ΚΑὶ ἀλλόφυλοι ἔλαβον τὴν κιβωτὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ εἰσήνεγκαν 1
αὐτὴν ἐξ Ἀβενέζερ εἰς Ἄζωτον. Καὶ ἔλαβον ἀλλόφυλοι τὴν κιβωτὸν 2
τοῦ Κυρίου, καὶ εἰσήνεγκαν αὐτὴν εἰς οἶκον Δαγών, καὶ παρέστη-
σαν αὐτὴν παρὰ Δαγών. Καὶ ὤρθρισαν οἱ Ἀζώτιοι τῇ ἐπαύριον, 3
καὶ εἰσῆλθαν εἰς οἶκον Δαγὼν· καὶ ἴδαν, καὶ ἰδοὺ Δαγὼν πεπτω-
κὼς ἐπὶ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ἐνώπιον κιβωτοῦ τοῦ Θεοῦ.
Καὶ ἤγειραν τὸν Δαγών, καὶ κατέστησαν αὐτὸν εἰς τὸν τόπον
αὐτοῦ. (Καὶ ἐβαρύνθη χεὶρ Κυρίου ἐπὶ τοὺς Ἀζωτίους, καὶ ἐβά-
σάνισεν αὐτούς· καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτοὺς εἰς τὰς ἕδρας αὐτῶν, τὴν
Ἄζωτον καὶ τὸ ὅριον αὐτῆς.) Καὶ ἐγένετο ὅτε ὤρθρισαν τὸ πρωῒ 4
τῇ ἐπαύριον, καὶ ἰδοὺ Δαγὼν πεπτωκὼς ἐπὶ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ
τὴν γῆν ἐνώπιον κιβωτοῦ διαθήκης Κυρίου· καὶ ἡ κεφαλὴ Δαγὼν
καὶ ἀμφότερα τὰ ἴχνη χειρῶν αὐτοῦ ἀφῃρημένα ἐπὶ τὰ ἐμπρό-
σθια Ἀμαρεθ ἕκαστον· (καὶ ἀμφότεροι οἱ καρποὶ τῶν χειρῶν αὐτοῦ
πεπτωκότες ἐπὶ τὸ πρόθυρον) πλὴν ἡ ῥάχις Δαγὼν ὑπελείφθη.
Διὰ τοῦτο οὐκ ἐπιβαίνουσιν οἱ ἱερεῖς Δαγὼν καὶ πᾶς ὁ εἰσπο- 5
ρευόμενος εἰς οἶκον Δαγὼν ἐπὶ βαθμὸν οἴκου Δαγὼν ἐν Ἀζώτῳ
ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης, ὅτι ὑπερβαίνοντες ὑπερβαίνουσι. Καὶ ἐβά- 6

**Chapter 4**

18 ...the Ark of God, he fell from off the seat backward, by the gate, and his back was broken, and he died; for the man was old and heavy. And he had judged Israel twenty years.

19 And his daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was with child, about to give birth. And she heard the tidings, that the Ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead; and she travailed and gave birth, for her pangs had turned upon her.

20 And in the time of her dying, the women that stood by her said unto her, "Fear not, for thou hast borne a son." But she answered not, neither did her heart understand.

21 And she named the child Uaiga-ethod; and they said concerning the Ark of God, and concerning her father-in-law, and concerning her husband, "Glory hath departed from Israel, for the Ark of the Lord was taken, and because her father-in-law was dead, and her husband."

22 And she said, "Glory hath departed from Israel: for the Ark of God is taken."

**Chapter 5**

1 Now the Philistines took the Ark of God, and they brought it from Aben-ezer unto Azotus.

2 And the Philistines took the Ark of the Lord, and brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.

3 And when the people of Azotus arose early on the morrow, and entered into the house of Dagon, they saw, and behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the Ark of God. And they took up Dagon, and set him in his place. (Now the hand of the Lord was heavy upon the men of Azotus, and He tormented them; and He smote them in their secret parts, even Azotus and its border.)

4 And it came to pass, when they arose early in the morning on the morrow, that behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord; and the head of Dagon and both the marks of his hands were cut off, upon the forefront of Amareth each; (and both the fruits of his hands were fallen upon the threshold) howbeit, the spine of Dagon was left.

5 Therefore the priests of Dagon, and all that come into the house of Dagon, do not tread upon the step of the house of Dagon in Azotus unto this day, because they do utterly overstep [it].

6 And the hand of the Lord was heavy upon Azotus.
