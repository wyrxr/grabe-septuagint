### CHAPTER 9.
**17** The gatekeepers were Shalloum, and Akoub, and Telman, and Aiman,
**18** and their brethren. Now Shalloum was their chief. And until this time, at the King's Gate,
on the eastern side, these were the gates of the encampments of the sons of
**19** Levi. And Shalloum, the son of Chōre, the son of Abiasaph, the son of Kore,
and his brethren, of the house of his father, the Korites, were upon the works of the service,
keeping the watches of the tabernacle; and their fathers were over the encampment of the Lord,
keeping the entrance.
**20** And Phinees, the son of Eleazar, was their leader before the Lord,
and these were with him.
**21** Zacharias, the son of Mosollam, was the gatekeeper of the door of the tabernacle of testimony.
**22** All the chosen ones for the gates, in the gates, were two hundred and twelve.
These were in their courts, and their reckoning.
David did sustain these, and Samuel the Seer, who discerned by their faithfulness.
**23** And these, and their sons, were over the gates in the House of the Lord,
in the house of the tabernacle, to keep watch.
**24** According to the four winds were the gates: toward the east,
the sea [to the west], the north, and the south.
**25** And their brethren in their courts were [appointed] to come in
every seven days, from time to time, with these.
**26** For four mighty men of the gates were [entrusted] with [their charge] in faithfulness.
The Levites were over the chambers, and over the treasures of the House of God;
they shall encamp [there], for the watch was upon them; and these were over the keys
**27** to open the doors of the sanctuary early in the morning.
**28** And some of them were over the equipment of the service,
for they were to bring them in by number, and by number were they to carry them out.
**29** And some of them were appointed over the vessels, and over all the holy vessels,
and over the fine flour, and the
**30** wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices.
And of the sons of the priests were perfumers of the holy anointing oil, and for the spices.
**31** And Mattabias, of the Levites, this one, the firstborn of Shalloum the Korite,
was faithfully entrusted with the works of the sacrifice of the pan for the great high priest.
**32** And Banaia, the Kohathite, of their brethren, was over the showbread,
to prepare it Sabbath by Sabbath.
**33** And these were the singers, chief fathers of the Levites, appointed for their daily courses,
because their work was upon them day and night.
**34** These were chief fathers of the Levites according to their generations;
these chief men dwelt in Hierousalem.
**35** And in Gabaon dwelt the father of Gabaon, Ieiel; and the name of his wife
**36** was Mocha. And his firstborn son was Abdon, and Ieiel.
