Ἰωὰβ τῇ σάλπιγγι, καὶ ἀπέστησαν πᾶς ὁ λαὸς, καὶ οὐ κατεδίωξαν 28
ὀπίσω τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ οὐ προσέθεντο ἔτι τοῦ πολεμεῖν. Καὶ 29
Ἀβεννὴρ καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες αὐτοῦ ἀπῆλθον εἰς δυσμὰς ὅλην τὴν νύκτα
ἐκείνην, καὶ διέβαινον τὸν Ἰορδάνην, καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν ὅλην τὴν
παρατείνουσαν, καὶ ἔρχονται εἰς παρεμβολήν. Καὶ Ἰωὰβ ἀπέστρε- 30
ψεν ἀπὸ ὀπίσω τοῦ Ἀβεννήρ, καὶ συνήθροισε πάντα τὸν λαόν, καὶ
ἐπεσκέπτησαν τῶν παίδων Δαυὶδ ἐννεακαίδεκα ἄνδρες, καὶ Ἀσαήλ. 31
Καὶ Ἀσαὴλ καὶ οἱ παῖδες Δαυὶδ ἐπάταξαν τῶν υἱῶν Βενιαμεὶν, τῶν ἀνδρῶν
Ἀβεννὴρ, τριακοσίους ἑξήντα ἄνδρας παρ᾿ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ αἴρουσι 32
τὸν Ἀσαήλ, καὶ θάπτουσιν αὐτὸν ἐν τῷ τάφῳ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ
τῷ ἐν Βηθλεέμ. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη ὅλην τὴν νύκτα Ἰωὰβ καὶ οἱ
ἄνδρες οἱ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ διέφυξεν αὐτοῖς ἐν Χεβρών.

ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο ὁ πόλεμος ἐπὶ πολὺ ἀναμέσον τοῦ οἴκου Σαοὺλ, 1
καὶ ἀναμέσον τοῦ οἴκου Δαυίδ. Καὶ ὁ οἶκος Δαυὶδ ἐπορεύετο
καὶ ἐκραταιοῦτο, καὶ ὁ οἶκος Σαοὺλ ἐπορεύετο καὶ ἠσθένει.
Καὶ ἐτέχθησαν τῷ Δαυὶδ υἱοὶ ἐν Χεβρών. Καὶ ἦν ὁ πρωτότοκος 2
αὐτοῦ Ἀμνὼν τῆς Ἀχινάαμ τῆς Ἰσραηλίτιδος, καὶ ὁ δεύτερος 3
αὐτοῦ Δαλουία τῆς Ἀβιγαίας τῆς Καρμηλίας, καὶ ὁ τρίτος
Ἀβεσσαλὼμ, υἱὸς Μααχὰθ, θυγατρὸς Θολμεὶ βασιλέως Γεσσίρ,
καὶ ὁ τέταρτος Ὀρνίας, υἱὸς Ἀγγίθ. Καὶ ὁ πέμπτος Σαφαθία, τῆς 4
Ἀβιτάλ, 5
καὶ ὁ ἕκτος Ἰεθεραὰμ, τῆς Αἰγλὰ, γυναικὸς Δαυίδ. Οὗτοι 6
ἐτέχθησαν τῷ Δαυὶδ ἐν Χεβρών. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ εἶναι
τὸν πόλεμον ἀναμέσον οἴκου Σαοὺλ, καὶ ἀναμέσον οἴκου Δαυίδ,
καὶ Ἀβεννὴρ ἦν κρατῶν τοῦ οἴκου Σαοῦλ. Καὶ τῷ Σαοὺλ παλλακὴ 7
Ῥεσφά, θυγάτηρ Ἰόλ. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰσοβοσθὲ υἱὸς Σαοὺλ πρὸς
Ἀβεννήρ, “Τί ὅτι εἰσῆλθες πρὸς τὴν παλλακὴν τοῦ πατρός μου;”
Καὶ ἐθυμώθη σφόδρα Ἀβεννὴρ περὶ τοῦ λόγου Ἰσοβοσθὲ, καὶ εἶπεν 8
Ἀβεννὴρ πρὸς αὐτόν, “Μὴ κεφαλὴ κυνὸς ἐγώ εἰμι; Σήμερον
ἐποίησα ἔλεος μετὰ τοῦ οἴκου Σαοὺλ τοῦ πατρός σου, καὶ περὶ
ἀδελφῶν καὶ περὶ γνωρίμων, καὶ οὐκ ηὐτομόλησα εἰς τὸν οἶκον
Δαυίδ, καὶ ἐπιζητεῖς ἐπ᾿ ἐμὲ ὑπὲρ ἀδικίας γυναικὸς σήμερον;
Τάδε ποιήσαι ὁ Θεὸς τῷ Ἀβεννὴρ, καὶ τάδε προσθείη αὐτῷ, 9
ὅτι καθὼς ὤμοσε Κύριος τῷ Δαυίδ, ὅτι οὕτω ποιήσω αὐτῷ, περιε- 10

**28** So Joab blew the trumpet, and all the people ceased [pursuing], and they pursued no more after Israel, and they continued no further to fight.

**29** And Abner and his men went toward the west all that night, and they crossed the Jordan, and they journeyed all the full extent [of the way], and they came unto the camp.

**30** And Joab turned back from following Abner, and gathered all the people, and they counted of the young men of David nineteen men, and Asahel [besides].

**31** Now Asahel and the young men of David had smitten of the sons of Benjamin, even of Abner's men, three hundred and threescore men from his side.

**32** And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the tomb of his father, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and the men that were with him journeyed all that night, and he brought them to safety in Hebron.

### CHAPTER 3

**1** And it came to pass that the war was prolonged for a great while between the house of Saul and between the house of David. And the house of David went forward and grew strong, but the house of Saul went forward and waxed weak.

**2** And sons were born unto David in Hebron. And his firstborn
**3** was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess; and his second, Dalouia, of Abigail the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom, the son of Maacah, the daughter of Tolmai, king of Gessir;
**4** and the fourth, Ornios, the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah, of
**5** Abital; and the sixth, Ithream, of Egla, David's wife.
**6** These were born unto David in Hebron. And it came to pass, whilst the war was between the house of Saul and between the house of David,
**7** that Abner was strengthening the house of Saul. Now Saul had a concubine named Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. And Ishbosheth, Saul's son, said unto Abner, "Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father's concubine?"

**8** Then Abner was exceeding wroth concerning the words of Ishbosheth, and Abner said unto him, "Am I a dog's head? This day have I shown mercy unto the house of Saul thy father, and for his brethren, and for his friends, and I have not turned traitor to the house of David; and dost thou now seek to lay a charge against me today concerning a woman's injustice?
**9** May God do so to Abner, and more also add to him, [I swear] that as the Lord swore unto David,
**10** that so shall I do unto him: to take away the kingdom—
