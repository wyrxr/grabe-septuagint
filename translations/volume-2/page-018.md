ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Α´.
ΚΕΦ. Η´. VIII.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο ὡς ἐγήρασε Σαμουήλ, καὶ κατέστησε τοὺς υἱοὺς
2 αὐτοῦ δικαστὰς τῷ ᾿Ισραήλ. Καὶ ταῦτα τὰ ὀνόματα τῶν υἱῶν
3 αὐτοῦ· πρωτότοκος Ἰωήλ, καὶ ὄνομα τοῦ δευτέρου αὐτοῦ Ἀβιά,
    δικασταὶ ἐν Βηρσαβεέ. Καὶ οὐκ ἐπορεύθησαν οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ
4 ἐν ὁδῷ αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐξέκλιναν ὀπίσω τῆς συντελείας, καὶ ἐλάμβανον
    δῶρα, καὶ ἐξέκλιναν δικαιώματα. Καὶ συναθροίζονται πάν-
5 τες ἄνδρες ᾿Ισραήλ, καὶ παραγίνονται πρὸς Σαμουὴλ εἰς Ἀρ-
    μαθαίμ, καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῷ· Ἰδοὺ σὺ γεγήρακας, καὶ οἱ υἱοί σου οὐ
6 πορεύονται ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ σου· καὶ νῦν κατάστησον ἐφ᾽ ἡμᾶς βασι-
    λέα δικάζειν ἡμᾶς, καθὰ καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ ἔθνη. Καὶ ἦν πονηρὸν
7 τὸ ῥῆμα ἐνώπιον Σαμουήλ, ὡς εἶπαν· δὸς ἡμῖν βασιλέα δικάζειν
    (ἐφ᾽) ἡμᾶς· Καὶ προσηύξατο Σαμουὴλ πρὸς Κύριον. Καὶ εἶπε
    Κύριος πρὸς Σαμουήλ· ἄκουε τῆς φωνῆς τοῦ λαοῦ, καθὰ ἂν λα-
8 λήσωσι σοι· ὅτι οὐ σὲ ἐξουθενήκασιν, ἀλλ᾽ ἢ ἐμὲ ἐξουθενήκασι,
    τοῦ μὴ βασιλεύειν ἐπ᾽ αὐτῶν. Κατὰ πάντα τὰ ποιήματα ἃ ἐποί-
    ησάν μοι, ἀφ᾽ ἧς ἡμέρας ἀνήγαγον αὐτοὺς ἐξ Αἰγύπτου καὶ ἕως
    τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης, καὶ ἐγκατέλιπόν με, καὶ ἐδούλευον θεοῖς ἑτέ-
9 ροις, οὕτως αὐτοὶ ποιοῦσι καὶ σοί. Καὶ νῦν ἄκουε τῆς φωνῆς αὐτῶν·
    πλὴν ὅτι διαμαρτυρόμενος διαμαρτύρῃ αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἀπαγγελεῖς αὐτοῖς
10 τὸ δικαίωμα τοῦ βασιλέως, ὃς βασιλεύσει ἐπ᾽ αὐτούς. Καὶ εἶπε
    Σαμουὴλ πᾶν τὸ ῥῆμα Κυρίου πρὸς τὸν λαόν, τοὺς αἰτοῦν-
11 τας παρ᾽ αὐτοῦ βασιλέα. Καὶ εἶπε· Τοῦτο ἔσται τὸ δικαίωμα τοῦ
    βασιλέως, ὃς βασιλεύσει ἐφ᾽ ὑμᾶς· Τοὺς υἱοὺς ὑμῶν λήψεται, καὶ
    θήσεται αὐτοὺς ἐν ἅρμασιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐν ἱππεῦσιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ
12 προτρέχοντας τῶν ἁρμάτων αὐτοῦ· καὶ θέσθαι αὐτοὺς ἑαυτῷ χιλιάρχους,
    καὶ ἑκατοντάρχους, καὶ θερίζειν θερισμὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ
    τρυγᾷν τρυγητὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ποιεῖν σκεύη πολεμικὰ αὐτοῦ, καὶ
13 σκεύη ἁρμάτων αὐτοῦ· καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας ὑμῶν λήψεται εἰς μυρευούς,
    καὶ εἰς μαγειρίσσας, καὶ εἰς πεσσούσας.
14 Καὶ τοὺς ἀγροὺς ὑμῶν καὶ τοὺς ἀμπελῶνας ὑμῶν καὶ τοὺς ἐλαιῶνας ὑμῶν τοὺς
15 ἀγαθοὺς λήψεται, καὶ δώσει τοῖς δούλοις αὐτοῦ· καὶ τὸ σπέρμα
    ὑμῶν καὶ τοὺς ἀμπελῶνας ὑμῶν ἀποδεκατώσει, καὶ δώσει τοῖς εὐνούχοις
    αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοῖς δούλοις αὐτοῦ.
16 Καὶ τοὺς δούλους ὑμῶν

**Chapter 8**

1
And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.

2
And these were the names of his sons:

3
the firstborn, Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah; [and they were] judges in Beersheba. But his sons walked not in his way;

4
but they turned aside after gain, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.

5
Then all the men of Israel gathered themselves together, and came unto Samuel to Ramathaim, and said unto him, "Behold, thou art grown old, and thy sons walk not in thy way;

6
now therefore, make us a king to judge us, like unto all the [other] nations."

7
And the thing was evil in the sight of Samuel, when they said, "Give us a king to judge (over) us." And Samuel prayed unto the Lord. And the Lord said unto Samuel, "Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they shall speak unto thee;

8
for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected Me, that I should not reign over them. According to all the works which they have done unto Me, from the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, when they have forsaken Me and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.

9
Now therefore hearken unto their voice; nevertheless, thou shalt solemnly protest unto them, and shalt declare unto them

10
the manner of the king that shall reign over them." And Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the people that asked of him a king.

11
And he said, "This shall be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and put them in his chariots, and among his horsemen,

12
and [they shall be] running before his chariots. And he will appoint them for himself captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds; and [he will command them] to reap his harvest, and to gather his vintage, and to make his instruments of war, and

13
his instruments for his chariots. And your daughters he will take for perfumers, and for cooks, and for bakers.

14
And your fields, and your vineyards, and your best olive trees,

15
he will take, and give them to his servants. And your seed, and your vineyards, he will decimate, and give [the tithe thereof] to his eunuchs and to his servants.

16
And your male servants,
