13 σίας ὁ τοῦ Ἀλδὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς ἐρχομένους ἀπὸ τοῦ πολέμου, καὶ εἶπαν
   αὐτοῖς· Οὐ μὴ εἰσαγάγητε τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν ὧδε πρὸς ἡμᾶς. Ἔτι
   εἰς τὸ ἁμαρτάνειν τῷ Κυρίῳ ἐφ᾿ ἡμᾶς ὑμεῖς λέγετε προσθεῖναι ἐπὶ
   ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις ἡμῶν, καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν ἄγνοιαν ἡμῶν, ὅτι πολλὴ ἡ
14 ἁμαρτία ἡμῶν, καὶ ὀργὴ θυμοῦ Κυρίου ἐπὶ τὸν Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἀφῆκαν
   οἱ πολεμισταὶ τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν καὶ τὰ σκῦλα ἐναντίον τῶν
15 ἀρχόντων, καὶ πάσης τῆς ἐκκλησίας. Καὶ ἀνέστησαν ἄνδρες οἳ
   ἐπεκλήθησαν ἐν ὀνόματι, καὶ ἀντελάβοντο τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας, καὶ
   πάντας τοὺς γυμνοὺς περιέβαλον ἀπὸ τῶν σκύλων, καὶ ἐνέδυσαν
   αὐτούς, καὶ ὑπέδησαν αὐτοὺς, καὶ ἔδωκαν φαγεῖν καὶ ἀλείψασθαι,
16 καὶ ἀντελάβοντο ἐν ὑποζυγίοις παντὸς ἀσθενοῦντος, καὶ κατέστησαν
   αὐτοὺς εἰς Ἱεριχὼ πόλιν Φοινίκων πρὸς τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτῶν, καὶ
   ὑπέστρεψαν εἰς Σαμάρειαν. Ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ ἀπέστειλεν ὁ
   βασιλεὺς Ἄχαζ πρὸς βασιλέα Ἀσοὺρ βοηθῆσαι αὐτῷ,
17 καὶ ἐν τούτῳ, ὅτι Ἰδουμαῖοι ἐπέθεντο, καὶ ἐπάταξαν ἐν Ἰούδα,
18 καὶ ᾐχμαλώτευσαν αἰχμαλωσίαν. Καὶ οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι ἐπέθεντο ἐπὶ
   τὰς πόλεις τῆς πεδινῆς, καὶ ἀπὸ λιβὸς τοῦ Ἰούδα, καὶ ἔλαβον τὴν
   Βαιθσαμὺς, καὶ τὴν Ἀἴλων, καὶ τὴν Γαδηρὼθ, καὶ τὴν Σωχὼ καὶ
   τὰς κώμας αὐτῆς, καὶ τὴν Θαμνὰ καὶ τὰς κώμας αὐτῆς, καὶ τὴν
19 Γαμζὼ καὶ τὰς κώμας αὐτῆς· καὶ κατώκησαν ἐκεῖ. Ὅτι ἐταπείνωσε
   Κύριος τὸν Ἰούδαν διὰ Ἄχαζ βασιλέα Ἰούδα, ὅτι ἀπέστη
20 ἀποστάσει ἀπὸ Κυρίου. Καὶ ἦλθεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν Θαλγαβφαλνασὰρ
21 βασιλεὺς Ἀσοὺρ, καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτόν. Καὶ ἔλαβεν Ἄχαζ τὰ ἐν
   οἴκῳ Κυρίου, καὶ τὰ ἐν οἴκῳ τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ τῶν ἀρχόντων,
22 καὶ ἔδωκε τῷ βασιλεῖ Ἀσοὺρ· καὶ οὐκ εἰς βοήθειαν αὐτῷ, ἀλλ' ἤ
   τῷ θλιβῆναι αὐτόν· καὶ προσέθηκε τοῦ ἀποστῆναι ἀπὸ Κυρίου, καὶ
23 εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἄχαζ· Ἐκζητήσω τοὺς θεοὺς Δαμασκοῦ τοὺς
   τύπτοντάς με, καὶ εἶπεν· οἱ θεοὶ βασιλέως Συρίας αὐτοὶ κατισχύ-
   σουσιν αὐτοὺς, αὐτοῖς τοίνυν θύσω, καὶ ἀντιλήψονται μου. καὶ αὐτοῦ
24 ἐγένοντο αὐτῷ εἰς σκῶλον, καὶ παντὶ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἀπέστησεν Ἄχαζ
   τὰ σκεύη οἴκου Κυρίου, καὶ κατέκοψεν αὐτὰ, καὶ ἔκλεισε
   τὰς θύρας οἴκου Κυρίου, καὶ ἐποίησεν αὐτῷ θυσιαστήρια ἐν πάσῃ
25 γωνίᾳ ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἐν πάσῃ πόλει καὶ πόλει ἐν Ἰούδα
   ἐποίησεν ὑψηλὰ θυμιᾶν θεοῖς ἀλλοτρίοις, καὶ παρώργισαν Κύριον
   Θεὸν τῶν πατέρων ἑαυτῶν.
26 Καὶ οἱ λοιποὶ λόγοι αὐτοῦ, καὶ αἱ πράξεις αὐτοῦ αἱ πρῶται καὶ
   ἔσχαται, ἰδοὺ γεγραμμέναι ἐπὶ βιβλίῳ βασιλέων Ἰούδα καὶ Ἰσραήλ.

### English Translation

¹³ Amasias the son of Adli, against them that came from the war; and they said unto them, "Ye shall not bring the captives hither unto us. Do ye yet mean to add unto our sins and unto our folly, that we should incur further judgment from the Lord upon us? For great is our sin, and the fierce wrath of the Lord is upon Israel."
¹⁴ So the warriors released the captives and the spoil before the chief men, and all the congregation.
¹⁵ And there rose up men who were chosen by name, and they took charge of the captives, and clothed all the naked from the spoil, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to anoint themselves;
¹⁶ and they took charge on beasts of burden of every one that was weak, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palms, unto their brethren; and they returned unto Samaria. At that time, King Ahaz sent unto the king of Assur to help him,
¹⁷ and in this [distress], because the Idumaeans had attacked, and smitten Judah,
¹⁸ and carried away captives. And the Philistines also attacked the cities of the lowland, and from the south of Judah; and they took Beth-Shemesh, and Aijalon, and Gederoth, and Sokho with her villages, and Timnah with her villages, and Gimzo with her villages; and they dwelt there.
¹⁹ For the Lord had humbled Judah because of Ahaz king of Judah, for he had utterly rebelled against the Lord.
²⁰ And Thalgathphalnasar king of Assur came against him, and smote him.
²¹ And Ahaz took the things that were in the house of the Lord, and those in the king's house and in the houses of the chief men, and gave [them] to the king of Assur;
²² and [this was] not for his help, but rather for his distress. And he did yet further rebel against the Lord, and King Ahaz said,
²³ "I will seek the gods of Damascus that smote me." And he said, "The gods of the king of Syria, they themselves do make them strong. Therefore will I sacrifice unto them, and they shall help me." And his own [idols] became a snare unto him, and unto all Israel.
²⁴ And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of the Lord, and cut them in pieces, and shut up the doors of the house of the Lord, and he made for himself altars in every corner in Jerusalem;
²⁵ and in every single city in Judah he made high places to burn incense unto strange gods, and provoked to wrath the Lord God of their fathers.
²⁶ Now the rest of his acts, and all his deeds, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
