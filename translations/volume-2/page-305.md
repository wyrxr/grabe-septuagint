**ΚΕΦ. Θʹ. Ι. ΤΩΝ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ ΙΟΥΔΑ Βʹ. 781**
Καὶ αὐτοὶ ἔφερον ἕκαστος τὰ δῶρα αὐτοῦ, σκεύη ἀργυρᾶ, καὶ 24
σκεύη χρυσᾶ, καὶ ἱματισμόν, στακτὴν καὶ ἡδύσματα, καὶ ἵππους
καὶ ἡμιόνους, τὸ κατ᾿ ἐνιαυτὸν ἐνιαυτόν. Καὶ ἦσαν τῷ Σαλωμὼν 25
τέσσαρες μυριάδες θήλειαι ἵππων εἰς ἅρματα, καὶ δώδεκα χιλιά-
δες ἱππέων, καὶ ἔθετο αὐτοὺς ἐν πόλεσι τῶν ἁρμάτων, καὶ μετὰ
τοῦ βασιλέως ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ ἦν ἡγούμενος πάντων τῶν βα- 26
σιλέων ἀπὸ τοῦ ποταμοῦ, καὶ ἕως τῆς γῆς ἀλλοφύλων, καὶ ἕως
ὁρίου Αἰγύπτου. Καὶ ἔδωκεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τὸ χρυσίον καὶ τὸ ἀργύ- 27
ριον ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ ὡς λίθους, καὶ τὰς κέδρους ὡς συκαμίνους
τὰς ἐν τῇ πεδινῇ εἰς πλῆθος. Καὶ ἡ ἔξοδος τῶν ἵππων ἐξ Αἰγύ- 28
πτου τῷ Σαλωμών, καὶ ἐκ πάσης τῆς γῆς. Καὶ οἱ κατάλοιποι 29
λόγοι Σαλωμὼν οἱ πρῶτοι καὶ οἱ ἔσχατοι, ἰδοὺ οὗτοι γεγραμμένοι
ἐπὶ τῶν λόγων Νάθαν τοῦ προφήτου, καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν λόγων ᾿Αχία
τοῦ Σηλωνίτου, καὶ ἐν ταῖς δράσεσιν ᾿Ιωὴλ τοῦ ὁρῶντος περὶ ῾Ιε-
ροβοὰμ υἱοῦ Ναβάτ. Καὶ ἐβασίλευσε Σαλωμὼν ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐπὶ 30
πάντα ᾿Ισραὴλ τεσσαράκοντα ἔτη. Καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Σαλωμών, καὶ 31
ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν ἐν πόλει Δαυὶδ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐβασίλευσε
῾Ροβοὰμ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ.

**ΚΕΦ. Ιʹ. Χ.**

ΚΑΙ ἦλθε ῾Ροβοὰμ εἰς Συχέμ, ὅτι εἰς Συχὲμ ἤρχετο πᾶς 1
᾿Ισραὴλ βασιλεῦσαι αὐτόν. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἤκουσεν Ἱεροβοὰμ 2
υἱὸς Ναβάτ, καὶ αὐτὸς ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ, ὡς ἔφυγεν ἀπὸ προσώπου
Σαλωμὼν τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ κατώκησεν Ἱεροβοὰμ ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ,
καὶ ἀπέστρεψεν Ἱεροβοὰμ ἐξ Αἰγύπτου. Καὶ ἀπέστειλαν, καὶ 3
ἐκάλεσαν αὐτόν, καὶ ἦλθεν Ἱεροβοάμ, καὶ πᾶσα ἡ ἐκκλησία ᾿Ισ-
ραὴλ πρὸς βασιλέα ῾Ροβοάμ, λέγοντες· ὁ πατήρ σου ἐσκλήρυνε τὸν 4
ζυγὸν ἡμῶν, καὶ νῦν ἄφες ἀπὸ τῆς δουλείας τοῦ πατρός σου τῆς
σκληρᾶς, καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ ζυγοῦ αὐτοῦ τοῦ βαρέος, οὗ ἔδωκεν ἐφ᾿ ἡμᾶς,
καὶ δουλεύσομέν σοι. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· πορεύεσθε ἕως τριῶν ἡμε- 5
ρῶν, καὶ ἔρχεσθε πρός μέ· καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ὁ λαός. Καὶ συνήγαγεν 6
**ὁ** βασιλεὺς ῾Ροβοὰμ τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους τοὺς ἑστηκότας ἐναντίον
Σαλωμὼν τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ ζῆν αὐτόν, λέγων· πῶς ὑμεῖς
βουλεύεσθε τοῦ ἀποκριθῆναι τῷ λαῷ τούτῳ λόγον; Καὶ ἐλάλη- 7
σαν αὐτῷ, λέγοντες· ἐὰν ἐν τῇ σήμερον γένῃ εἰς ἀγαθὸν τῷ λαῷ

**Chapter 9**

24 And they brought, each one, his own gifts: vessels of silver and vessels of gold, and raiment, stacte and spices, and horses and mules, year by year.
25 And Solomon had forty thousand mares for chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; and he placed them in the chariot cities, and with the king in Jerusalem.
26 And he was overlord of all the kings, from the River even unto the land of the Philistines, and even unto the border of Egypt.
27 And the king made gold and silver in Jerusalem as stones, and the cedars as sycamore trees which are in the plain, in great abundance.
28 And the export of horses for Solomon [came] from Egypt, and from all the land.
29 Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, the first and the last, behold, these are written in the words of Nathan the prophet, and in the words of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Joel the seer, concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
30 And King Solomon reigned over all Israel forty years.
31 And Solomon slept, and they buried him in the city of David his father; and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.

**Chapter 10**

1 And Rehoboam came to Shechem, for all Israel came to Shechem to make him king.
2 And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard [this]; (now he was in Egypt, for he had fled from the face of Solomon the king, and Jeroboam had dwelt there in Egypt); [that] Jeroboam returned from Egypt.
3 And they sent and called him; and Jeroboam came, and all the assembly of Israel unto King Rehoboam, saying:
4 "Thy father made our yoke grievous; and now, do thou ease [us] from the hard service of thy father, and from his heavy yoke, which he did lay upon us, and we will serve thee."
5 And he said unto them, "Go ye yet for three days, then come again to me." And the people departed.
6 And King Rehoboam gathered the elders who stood before Solomon his father in his lifetime, saying, "How do ye counsel that I may answer this people a word?"
7 And they spoke unto him, saying, "If thou be kind to this people today, and please them, and speak unto them good words..."
