ΚΕΦ. Ηʹ. VIII.

¹ ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο μετὰ εἴκοσιν ἔτη ἐν οἷς ᾠκοδόμησε Σαλωμὼν
² τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου, καὶ τὸν οἶκον ἑαυτοῦ, καὶ τὰς πόλεις ἃς ἔδωκε Χειρὰμ τῷ Σαλωμῶν, ᾠκοδόμησεν αὐτὰς Σαλωμῶν, καὶ κατ-
³ ῴκισεν ἐκεῖ τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἦλθε Σαλωμὼν εἰς Αἰμὰθ Σωβά, καὶ κατίσχυσεν αὐτήν· καὶ ᾠκοδόμησε τὴν Θεδμὼρ ἐν τῇ
⁴ ἐρήμῳ, καὶ πάσας τὰς πόλεις τὰς ὀχυρὰς ἃς ᾠκοδόμησεν ἐν Ἡ-
⁵ μάθ. Καὶ ᾠκοδόμησε τὴν Βαιθωρὼν τὴν ἄνω, καὶ τὴν Βαιθωρὼν
⁶ τὴν κάτω, πόλεις ὀχυράς· τείχη, πύλαι, καὶ μοχλοί· καὶ τὴν Βαλαάς, καὶ πάσας τὰς πόλεις τὰς ὀχυρὰς αἳ ἦσαν τῷ Σαλωμῶν, καὶ πάσας τὰς πόλεις τῶν ἁρμάτων, καὶ πάσας τὰς πόλεις τῶν ἱππέων· καὶ ὅσα ἐπεθύμησε Σαλωμὼν κατὰ τὴν ἐπιθυμίαν τοῦ οἰκοδομῆσαι ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἐν τῷ Λιβάνῳ, καὶ ἐν πάσῃ τῇ βασιλεία αὐτοῦ.
⁷ Πᾶς δ᾽ ὁ λαὸς ὁ καταλειφθεὶς ἀπὸ τοῦ Χετταίου, καὶ τοῦ Ἀμοῤῥαίου, καὶ τοῦ Φερεζαίου, καὶ τοῦ Εὐαίου, καὶ τοῦ
⁸ Ἱεβουσαίου, οἳ οὐκ εἰσὶν ἐκ τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, ἦσαν ἐκ τῶν υἱῶν αὐτῶν τῶν καταλειφθέντων μετ᾿ αὐτοὺς ἐν τῇ γῇ, οὓς οὐκ ἐξωλέθρευσαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἀνήγαγεν αὐτοὺς Σαλωμὼν εἰς φόρον ἕως τῆς
⁹ ἡμέρας ταύτης. Καὶ ἐκ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ οὐκ ἔδωκε Σαλωμὼν εἰς παῖδας τῇ βασιλείᾳ αὐτοῦ· ὅτι αὐτοὶ ἄνδρες πολεμισταί, καὶ
¹⁰ ἄρχοντες, καὶ δυνατοί, καὶ ἄρχοντες ἁρμάτων καὶ ἱππέων. Καὶ οὗτοι ἄρχοντες τῶν προστατῶν τῷ βασιλεῖ Σαλωμῶν, πεντήκοντα
¹¹ καὶ διακόσιοι ἐργοδιωκτοῦντες ἐν τῷ λαῷ. Καὶ τὴν θυγατέρα Φαραὼ Σαλωμὼν ἀνήγαγεν ἐκ πόλεως Δαυὶδ εἰς τὸν οἶκον ὃν ᾠκοδόμησεν αὐτῇ, ὅτι εἶπεν· οὐ κατοικήσει γυνή μου ἐν πόλει Δαυὶδ τοῦ βασιλέως Ἰσραήλ, ὅτι ἅγιός ἐστιν οὗ εἰσῆλθεν ἐκεῖ κιβωτὸς Κυρίου·
¹² τότε ἀνήνεγκε Σαλωμὼν ὁλοκαυτώματα τῷ Κυρίῳ ἐπὶ
¹³ τὸ θυσιαστήριον Κυρίου, ὃ ᾠκοδόμησεν ἀπέναντι τοῦ ναοῦ, καὶ κατὰ τὸν λόγον ἡμέρας ἐν ἡμέρᾳ, τοῦ ἀναφέρειν κατὰ τὰς ἐντολὰς Μωσῆ ἐν τοῖς σαββάτοις, καὶ ἐν τοῖς μησί, καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἑορταῖς, τρεῖς καιροὺς τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ, ἐν τῇ ἑορτῇ τῶν ἀζύμων, καὶ ἐν

CHAPTER 8.

¹ And it came to pass, when twenty years were fulfilled, in the which Solomon had built
² the house of the LORD, and his own house, [that] the cities which Hiram had given unto Solomon, Solomon built them, and [then] settled
³ there the sons of Israel. And Solomon went forth to Hamath-zobah, and took it by strength. And he built Tadmor in the
⁴ wilderness, and all the strong cities which he had built in Hamath.
⁵ And he built Beth-horon the Upper, and Beth-horon
⁶ the Lower, fortified cities; [with] walls, gates, and bars; and Baalath, and all the strong cities that were Solomon's, and all the cities of chariots, and all the cities of horsemen; and whatsoever Solomon desired, according to the longing of his soul, to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and throughout all his kingdom.
⁷ As for all the people that were left of the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the
⁸ Jebusite, who were not of Israel, [but rather] of their sons who were left after them in the land, whom the sons of Israel did not utterly destroy, these did Solomon raise up for tribute unto this
⁹ day. But of the sons of Israel did Solomon make no bondservants for his kingdom; for they were men of war, and
¹⁰ princes, and mighty men, and captains of chariots and of horsemen. And these were the chief of the overseers of King Solomon, two hundred
¹¹ and fifty, overseeing the work among the people. And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the City of David unto the house which he had built for her; for he said, "My wife shall not dwell in the City of David, the king of Israel's [city], for it is holy whereinto the ark of the LORD hath come."
¹² Then did Solomon offer up burnt offerings unto the LORD upon
¹³ the altar of the LORD, which he had built before the Temple; and [this he did] according to the daily word, [so] to offer according to the commandments of Moses, on the Sabbaths, and on the New Moons, and on the Feasts, three times in the year: in the Feast of Unleavened Bread, and in
¹⁴ the Feast of Weeks, and in the Feast of Tabernacles. And he appointed, according to the ordinance of David his father, the divisions of the priests according to their ministries. And the Levites according to their watches,
