ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Α΄. ΚΕΦ. ΙΔ΄.
νάν· ἀπάγγειλόν μοι τί πεποίηκας· καὶ ἀπήγγειλεν αὐτῷ Ἰωνά-
θαν· καὶ εἶπε· γευσάμενος ἐγευσάμην ἐν ἄκρῳ τῷ σκήπτρῳ τῷ
44 ἐν τῇ χειρί μου βραχὺ μέλι, ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἀποθνήσκω. Καὶ εἶπεν
αὐτῷ Σαούλ· τάδε ποιήσαι μοι ὁ Θεὸς καὶ τάδε προσθείη, ὅτι
45 θανάτῳ ἀποθανῇ σήμερον. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ λαὸς πρὸς Σαούλ· εἰ σή-
μερον θανατωθήσεται ὁ ποιήσας τὴν σωτηρίαν ἐν Ἰσραήλ; τὴν
μεγάλην ταύτην; ἵλεως· Ζῇ Κύριος, εἰ πεσεῖται ἀπὸ τῆς τριχὸς
τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, ὅτι ὁ λαὸς τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐποίησε
τὴν ἡμέραν ταύτην· καὶ προσήύξατο ὁ λαὸς περὶ Ἰωνάθαν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ
46 ἐκείνῃ, καὶ οὐκ ἀπέθανε. Καὶ ἀνέβη Σαούλ ἀπὸ ὄπισθεν τῶν
47 ἀλλοφύλων· καὶ οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι ἀπῆλθον εἰς τὸν τόπον αὐτῶν. Καὶ
Σαούλ ἔλαχε τοῦ βασιλεύειν ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ· καὶ ἐπολέμει κύκλῳ
πάντας τοὺς ἐχθροὺς αὐτοῦ, εἰς τὸν Μωάβ, καὶ εἰς τοὺς υἱοὺς
Ἀμμῶν, καὶ εἰς τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἐδὼμ, καὶ εἰς τὸν Βεθὼρ, καὶ εἰς
Βασιλέα Σουβὰ, καὶ εἰς τοὺς ἀλλοφύλους· οὗ ἂν ἐστράφη, ἐσώ-
48 ζετο. Καὶ ἐποίησε δύναμιν, καὶ ἐπάταξε τὸν Ἀμαλήκ· καὶ ἐξεί-
49 λατο τὸν Ἰσραὴλ ἐκ χειρὸς τῶν καταπατούντων αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἦσαν
οἱ υἱοὶ Σαοὺλ Ἰωνάθαν, καὶ Ἰσουεὶ καὶ Μελχισουέ· καὶ ὀνόματα
τῶν δύο θυγατέρων αὐτοῦ, ὄνομα τῇ πρωτοτόκῳ Μερόβ, καὶ ὄνο-
50 μα τῇ δευτέρᾳ Μελχόλ. Καὶ ὄνομα τῇ γυναικὶ αὐτοῦ Ἀχινοόμ,
θυγάτηρ Ἀχιμάας· καὶ ὄνομα τῷ ἀρχιστρατήγῳ αὐτοῦ Ἀβενὴρ,
51 υἱὸς Νὴρ, υἱοῦ οἰκείου Σαούλ. Καὶ Κεὶς πατὴρ Σαούλ, καὶ Νὴρ
52 πατὴρ Ἀβενὴρ, υἱὸς Ἰαμεὶν, υἱοῦ Ἀβιήλ. Καὶ ἦν ὁ πόλεμος κρα-
ταιὸς ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀλλοφύλους πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας Σαούλ. Καὶ ἰδὼν
Σαοὺλ πάντα ἄνδρα δυνατὸν, καὶ πάντα ἄνδρα υἱὸν δυνάμεως,
καὶ συνήγαγεν αὐτοὺς πρὸς αὐτόν.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΕ΄. XV.

1 ΚΑΙ εἶπε Σαμουὴλ πρὸς Σαούλ· ἐμὲ ἀπέστειλε Κύριος χρί-
σαί σε εἰς βασιλέα ἐπὶ τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ, ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ· καὶ νῦν ἄ-
2 κουσον τῆς φωνῆς τῶν λόγων Κυρίου· τάδε εἶπε Κύριος Σαβαώθ·
νῦν ἐκδικήσω ἃ ἐποίησεν Ἀμαλὴκ τῷ Ἰσραήλ, ὡς ἀπήντησεν
3 αὐτῷ ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ ἀναβαίνοντος αὐτοῦ ἐξ Αἰγύπτου· καὶ νῦν πο-
ρεύου, καὶ πατάξεις τὸν Ἀμαλὴκ καὶ Ἰερεὶμ καὶ πάντα τὰ αὐτοῦ,
καὶ οὐ περιποιήσῃ ἐξ αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐξολοθρεύσεις αὐτόν· καὶ ἀνα-

**1 Samuel 14**
43 ...than: "Tell me what thou hast done." And Jonathan answered him and said,
44 "I did taste, indeed, with the tip of the rod that was in my hand, a little honey; and behold, I must die."
45 And Saul said unto him, "May God do so to me, and more also, for thou shalt surely die this day." But the people said unto Saul, "Shall he who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel be put to death this day? Far be it! As the LORD liveth, if one hair of his head shall fall to the ground, for the people of God have wrought this day!" And the people prayed for Jonathan that day;
46 and he died not. And Saul went up from pursuing the Philistines;
47 and the Philistines departed to their own place. And Saul took possession of the kingdom over Israel; and he warred round about against all his enemies: against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against the children of Edom, and against Bethhoron, and against the King of Zobah, and against the Philistines. Whithersoever he turned, he was delivered.
48 And he wrought a mighty deed, and smote Amalek; and he delivered Israel out of the hand of those who oppressed them.
49 Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Malchishua; and the names of his two daughters were Merab, the elder, and Michal, the younger.
50 And the name of his wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz; and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, a kinsman of Saul.
51 And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner, the father of Abner, was the son of Iamin, the son of Abiel.
52 And the war was fierce against the Philistines all the days of Saul. And when Saul saw any valiant man, and any man [who was a] son of strength, he gathered him unto himself.

**1 Samuel 15**
1 Then Samuel said unto Saul, "The LORD hath sent me to anoint thee king over His people, over Israel. Now therefore, hearken unto the voice of the words of the LORD.
2 Thus saith the LORD of Hosts: I will now avenge that which Amalek did to Israel, how he set himself against him in the way, when he came up out of Egypt.
3 Now go and smite Amalek, and Jeremy, and all that pertain unto him, and spare not any of him; but utterly destroy him; and utterly curse..."
