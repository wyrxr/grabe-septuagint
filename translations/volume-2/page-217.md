ΚΕΦ. Ιϛʹ. ΙΖʹ. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Δʹ. 693
ὅσα ἀπέστειλεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἄχαζ ἐκ Δαμασκοῦ οὕτως ἐποίησεν
Οὐρίας ὁ ἱερεύς, ἕως ἔρχεσθαι τὸν βασιλέα Ἄχαζ ἀπὸ Δαμασκοῦ.
Καὶ ἦλθεν ὁ βασιλεὺς ἀπὸ Δαμασκοῦ, καὶ εἶδεν ὁ βασιλεὺς 12
τὸ θυσιαστήριον, καὶ προσῆλθεν ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον,
καὶ ἀνέβη ἐπ᾿ αὐτό· καὶ ἐθυμίασε τὴν ὁλοκαύτωσιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὴν 13
θυσίαν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔσπεισε τὴν σπονδὴν αὐτοῦ, καὶ προσέχεε τὸ
αἷμα τῶν εἰρηνικῶν τῶν αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον, τὸ χαλκοῦν,
τὸ ἀπέναντι Κυρίου. Καὶ προσήγαγε τὸ πρόσωπον τοῦ οἴκου Κυ- 14
ρίου, (καὶ) ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀναμέσον τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου, καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀνα-
μέσον τοῦ οἴκου Κυρίου· καὶ ἔδειξεν αὐτὸ ἐπὶ μηρὸν τοῦ θυσια-
στηρίου κατὰ βορρᾶν· καὶ ἐνετείλατο ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἄχαζ τῷ Οὐρίᾳ 15
τῷ ἱερεῖ, λέγων· ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον τὸ μέγα πρόσφερε τὴν ὁλο-
καύτωσιν τὴν πρωϊνήν, καὶ τὴν θυσίαν τὴν ἑσπερινήν, καὶ τὴν
ὁλοκαύτωσιν τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ τὴν θυσίαν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὴν ὁλο-
καύτωσιν παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ τῆς γῆς, καὶ τὴν θυσίαν αὐτῶν, καὶ
σπονδὴν αὐτῶν, καὶ πᾶν αἷμα ὁλοκαυτώσεως, καὶ πᾶν αἷμα θυ-
σίας ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸ προσχεεῖς· καὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον τὸ χαλκοῦν ἔσται
μοι εἰς πρωΐ. Καὶ ἐποίησεν Οὐρίας ὁ ἱερεὺς κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἐνε- 16
τείλατο αὐτῷ ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἄχαζ. Καὶ συνέκοψεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἄ- 17
χαζ τὰ συγκλείσματα τῶν μεχωνὼθ, καὶ μετῆρεν ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν τὸν
λουτῆρα, καὶ τὴν θάλασσαν καθεῖλεν ἀπὸ τῶν βοῶν τῶν χαλκῶν
τῶν (δέκα) ὑποκάτω αὐτῆς, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὴν ἐπὶ βάσιν λιθίνην.
Καὶ τὸν θεμέλιον τῆς καθέδρας ᾠκοδόμησεν ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου, καὶ 18
τὴν εἴσοδον τοῦ βασιλέως τὴν ἔξω ἐπέστρεφεν ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου
ἀπὸ προσώπου τοῦ βασιλέως Ἀσσυρίων. Καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λό- 19
γων Ἄχαζ ὅσα ἐποίησεν, οὐχὶ ταῦτα γεγραμμένα ἐπὶ βιβλίῳ
λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν Ἰούδα; Καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Ἄχαζ 20
μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐτάφη μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ
ἐν πόλει Δαυΐδ, καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Ἑζεκίας υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΖʹ. XVII.

ἝΝ ἔτει δωδεκάτῳ τῷ Ἄχαζ βασιλεῖ Ἰούδα ἐβασίλευσεν 1
Ὠσηὲ υἱὸς Ἡλὰ ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ, ἐπὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐννέα ἔτη· καὶ ἐποίησε 2
τὸ πονηρὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς Κυρίου, πλὴν οὐχ ὡς οἱ βασιλεῖς Ἰσραὴλ
οἱ ἦσαν ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ. Ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν ἀνέβη Σαλαμανασὰρ βασι- 3

### Literary Translation:

### 2 Kings 16

**11** all things whatsoever King Ahaz had sent from Damascus, even so did Urijah the priest; until King Ahaz came from Damascus.
**12** And the king came from Damascus, and the king saw the altar, and the king drew near unto the altar, and went up thereon.
**13** And he offered up his burnt offering, and his meat offering, and poured forth his drink offering, and he sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings upon the brazen altar, which was before the LORD.
**14** And he brought near the face of the house of the LORD; (and) from between the altar, and from between the house of the LORD, he set it upon the side of the altar toward the north.
**15** And King Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, "Upon the great altar offer thou the morning burnt offering, and the evening meat offering, and the burnt offering of the king, and his meat offering, and the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their meat offering, and their drink offering; and all the blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the meat offering, thou shalt pour upon it; and the brazen altar shall be for me in the morning."
**16** And Urijah the priest did according to all things whatsoever King Ahaz had commanded him.
**17** And King Ahaz cut off the panels of the stands, and removed the lavers from them; and he took down the [bronze] sea from off the brazen oxen, even the (ten) which were under it, and he placed it upon a pavement of stone.
**18** And the foundation of the royal dais he built in the house of the LORD; and the outer entrance of the king he turned in the house of the LORD, because of the king of Assyria.
**19** Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
**20** And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.

### 2 Kings 17

**1** In the twelfth year of Ahaz, king of Judah, Hoshea, the son of Elah, began to reign in Samaria over Israel for nine years.
**2** And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; yet not as the kings of Israel that were before him.
**3** Against him came up Shalmaneser, king [of Assyria].
