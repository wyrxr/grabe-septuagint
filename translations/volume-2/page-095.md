ΚΕΦ. ΙΔʹ. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Βʹ. 571
κρύψης ἀπ᾽ ἐμοῦ ῥῆμα, ὃ ἐγὼ ἐπερωτῶ σε. Καὶ εἶπεν ἡ γυνή·
λαλησάτω δὴ ὁ κύριός μου ὁ βασιλεύς. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεύς· 19
μὴ ἡ χεὶρ Ἰωὰβ μετὰ σοῦ ἐν παντὶ τούτῳ; καὶ εἶπεν ἡ γυνή
τῷ βασιλεῖ· Ζῇ ἡ ψυχή σου, κύριέ μου βασιλεῦ, εἰ ἔστιν εἰς τὰ
δεξιὰ ἢ εἰς τὰ ἀριστερὰ ἐκ πάντων (τούτων) ὧν ἐλάλησεν ὁ κύ-
ριός μου ὁ βασιλεύς, ὅτι ὁ δοῦλός σου Ἰωὰβ αὐτὸς ἐνετείλατό
μοι, καὶ αὐτὸς ἔθετο ἐν τῷ στόματι (μου) τῆς δούλης σου πάντας
τοὺς λόγους τούτους. Ἕνεκεν τοῦ περιελθεῖν τὸ πρόσωπον τοῦ 20
ῥήματος τούτου, ὃ ἐποίησεν ὁ δοῦλός σου Ἰωὰβ τὸν λόγον τοῦτον·
καὶ ὁ κύριός μου (Ἰωὰβ) σοφὸς καθὼς σοφία ἀγγέλου τοῦ Θεοῦ,
τοῦ γνῶναι πάντα τὰ ἐν τῇ γῇ. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεύς πρὸς Ἰ- 21
ωάβ· ἰδοὺ δὴ ἐποίησά σοι κατὰ τὸν λόγον σου τοῦτον· καὶ πορεύ-
θητι, (καὶ) ἐπίστρεφον τὸ παιδάριον, τὸν Ἀβεσσαλώμ. Καὶ ἔπε- 22
σεν Ἰωὰβ ἐπὶ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, καὶ προσεκύνησε,
καὶ εὐλόγησε τὸν βασιλέα. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰωάβ· σήμερον ἔγνω ὁ
δοῦλός σου ὅτι εὗρον χάριν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς σου, κύριέ μου βασιλεῦ,
ὅτι ἐποίησεν ὁ κύριός μου ὁ βασιλεὺς τὸν λόγον τοῦ δούλου αὐ-
τοῦ. Καὶ ἀνέστη Ἰωάβ, καὶ ἐπορεύθη εἰς Γεδσούρ, καὶ ἤγαγε 23
τὸν Ἀβεσσαλὼμ εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεύς· ἀποστρα- 24
φήτω εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὸ πρόσωπόν μου μὴ βλεπέτω. Καὶ
ἀπέστρεψεν ὁ Ἀβεσσαλὼμ εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὸ πρόσω-
πον τοῦ βασιλέως οὐκ εἶδε. Καὶ ὡς Ἀβεσσαλὼμ οὐκ ἦν ἀνὴρ 25
καλὸς ἐν παντὶ Ἰσραήλ, αἰνετὸς σφόδρα, ἀπὸ ἴχνους ποδὸς αὐτοῦ
καὶ ἕως κορυφῆς αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἦν ἐν αὐτῷ μῶμος. Καὶ ἐν τῷ κεί- 26
ρεσθαι αὐτὸν τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐγένετο ἀπ᾽ ἀρχῆς ἡμερῶν
εἰς ἡμέρας ὡς ἂν ἐκείρετο, ὅτι κατεβαρύνετο ἐπ᾽ αὐτόν, καὶ χει-
ρόμενος αὐτὴν ἔστησε τὴν τρίχα τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ διακοσίους σί-
κλους ἐν τῷ σίκλῳ τῷ βασιλικῷ. Καὶ ἐτέχθησαν τῷ Ἀβεσσα- 27
λὼμ τρεῖς υἱοί, καὶ θυγάτηρ μία· καὶ ὄνομα αὐτῇ Θαμάρ· αὔ-
τη ἦν γυνὴ καλὴ σφόδρα· καὶ γίνεται γυνὴ τῷ Ῥοβοὰμ υἱῷ Σα-
λωμών, καὶ τίκτει αὐτῷ τὸν Ἀβιάν. Καὶ ἐκάθισεν Ἀβεσσαλὼμ 28
ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ δύο ἔτη ἡμερῶν, καὶ τὸ πρόσωπον τοῦ βασιλέως
οὐκ εἶδε. Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ἀβεσσαλὼμ πρὸς Ἰωὰβ ἀποστεῖλαι 29
αὐτὸν πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα, καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησεν ἐλθεῖν πρὸς αὐτόν. Καὶ
ἀπέστειλεν ἐκ δευτέρου πρὸς αὐτόν, καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησε παραγενέ-
σθαι. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς τοὺς παῖδας αὐτοῦ Ἀβεσσαλώμ· ἴδετε, ἡ 30

**18** "hide not from me the word which I ask of thee." And the woman said, "Let my lord the king, I pray thee, speak." And the king said,
**19** "Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this?" And the woman said unto the king, "As thy soul liveth, my lord, O king, there is no turning to the right hand or to the left from all (these things) which my lord the king hath spoken; for thy servant Joab, he himself did command me, and he himself did put all these words into the mouth of thine handmaid.
**20** For to compass the face of this matter, thy servant Joab hath done this thing; and my lord Joab is wise, as is the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth."
**21** And the king said unto Joab, "Behold, I have done for thee according to this thy word; and go, and bring back the young man, even Absalom."
**22** And Joab fell upon his face to the ground, and bowed himself, and blessed the king. And Joab said, "Today thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, because my lord the king hath performed the word of his servant."
**23** And Joab arose, and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
**24** And the king said, "Let him turn aside into his own house, and let him not see my face." And Absalom turned aside into his own house, and saw not the king's face.
**25** And there was not in all Israel a man so fair as Absalom, greatly to be praised; from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.
**26** And when he did poll his head, and it came to pass from [the beginning of] days unto days, as oft as he polled it, for it was heavy upon him, and he took it in his hand and weighed the hair of his head two hundred shekels by the king's weight.
**27** And unto Absalom were born three sons, and one daughter; and her name was Tamar. This woman was very beautiful; and she became the wife of Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, and bore him Abijah.
**28** And Absalom dwelt in Jerusalem for two years of days, and saw not the king's face.
**29** And Absalom sent unto Joab, [desiring him] to send him to the king; but he would not come unto him. And he sent again a second time unto him, but he would not come.
**30** And Absalom said unto his servants, "Behold, Joab's portion in the field is adjoining mine, and he hath barley there; go ye, and set it on fire with fire."
