### Original Greek Text:
27 σῆς. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος· καί γε τὸν Ἰούδαν ἀποστήσω ἀπὸ τοῦ προσώπου μου, καθὼς ἀπέστησα τὸν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἀπώσομαι τὴν πόλιν ταύτην ἣν ἐξελεξάμην, τὴν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ τὸν οἶκον οὗ εἶπον, ἔσται τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐκεῖ.
28 Καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Ἰωσίου, καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν, οὐχὶ ταῦτα γεγραμμένα ἐπὶ βιβλίου λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν Ἰούδα;
29 Ἐν δὲ ταῖς ἡμέραις αὐτοῦ ἀνέβη Φαραὼ Νεχαὼ βασιλεὺς Αἰγύπτου ἐπὶ βασιλέα Ἀσσυρίων ἐπὶ ποταμὸν Εὐφράτην· καὶ ἐπορεύθη Ἰωσίας εἰς ἀπάντησιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐθανάτωσεν αὐτὸν ἐν Μαγεδδὼ ἐν τῷ ἰδεῖν αὐτόν.
30 Καὶ ἐπεβίβασαν αὐτὸν νεκρὸν οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ ἐκ Μαγεδδῶ, καὶ ἤγαγον αὐτὸν εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν ἐν τῷ τάφῳ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἔλαβεν ὁ λαὸς τῆς γῆς τὸν Ἰωάχαζ υἱὸν Ἰωσίου, καὶ ἔχρισαν αὐτόν, καὶ ἐβασίλευσαν αὐτὸν ἀντὶ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ.
31 Υἱὸς εἴκοσι καὶ τριῶν ἐτῶν ἦν Ἰωάχαζ ἐν τῷ βασιλεύειν αὐτόν, καὶ τρεῖς μῆνας ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ὄνομα τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ Ἀμιτάλ, θυγάτηρ Ἱερεμίου, ἐκ Λοβενά.
32 Καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ πονηρὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς Κυρίου, κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησαν οἱ πατέρες αὐτοῦ.
33 Καὶ μετέστησεν αὐτὸν Φαραὼ Νεχαὼ ἐν Δεβλαὰ ἐν γῇ Ἀιμὰθ τοῦ μὴ βασιλεύειν αὐτὸν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἔδωκε ζημίαν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, ἑκατὸν τάλαντα ἀργυρίου, καὶ ἑκατὸν τάλαντα χρυσίου.
34 Καὶ ἐβασίλευσε Φαραὼ Νεχαὼ ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς τὸν Ἐλιακείμ, υἱὸν Ἰωσίου βασιλέως Ἰούδα, ἀντὶ Ἰωσίου τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐπέστρεψε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ἰωακείμ· καὶ τὸν Ἰωάχαζ ἔλαβε, καὶ εἰσήνεγκεν εἰς Αἴγυπτον· καὶ ἀπέθανεν ἐκεῖ.
35 Καὶ τὸ ἀργύριον καὶ τὸ χρυσίον ἔδωκεν Ἰωακεὶμ τῷ Φαραὼ Νεχαώ, πλὴν ἐτιμογράφησε τὴν γῆν τοῦ δοῦναι τὸ ἀργύριον ἐπὶ στόματος Φαραώ· ἀνὴρ κατὰ τὴν συντίμησιν αὐτοῦ ἔδωκαν τὸ ἀργύριον, καὶ τὸ χρυσίον μετὰ τοῦ λαοῦ τῆς γῆς, τοῦ δοῦναι τῷ Φαραὼ Νεχαώ.
36 Υἱὸς εἴκοσι καὶ πέντε ἐτῶν Ἰωακεὶμ ἐν τῷ βασιλεύειν αὐτόν, καὶ ἔνδεκα ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ὄνομα τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ Ἰελδάφ, θυγάτηρ Φαδαΐλ, ἐκ Ῥουμά.
37 Καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ πονηρὸν ἐνώπιον Κυρίου, κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησαν οἱ πατέρες αὐτοῦ·

### Literary Translation:

### 2 Kings 23

**27** ...Manasseh. And the Lord said, "Verily, I will remove Judah also from My presence, just as I have removed Israel; and I will cast off this city, Jerusalem, which I have chosen, and the house whereof I said, 'My Name shall be there.'"
**28** Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
**29** In his days, Pharaoh Necho, the king of Egypt, went up against the king of Assyria unto the river Euphrates; and Josiah went forth to meet him, and he [Pharaoh] slew him in Megiddo when he saw him.
**30** And his servants carried his dead body from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulchre. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz, the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father's stead.
**31** Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
**32** And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his fathers had done.
**33** And Pharaoh Necho removed him [from reigning] in Diblah, in the land of Hamath, that he should not reign in Jerusalem; and he imposed a tribute upon the land, a hundred talents of silver, and a hundred talents of gold.
**34** And Pharaoh Necho made Eliakim, the son of Josiah, king over them, in the stead of Josiah his father. And he changed his name to Jehoiakim; and he took Jehoahaz, and brought him into Egypt; and he died there.
**35** And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold unto Pharaoh Necho; yet he levied a tax upon the land to give the silver at the commandment of Pharaoh. Every man according to his assessment gave they the silver and the gold, with the people of the land, to give it unto Pharaoh Necho.
**36** Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Ieldaf, the daughter of Phadael of Rumah.
**37** And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his fathers had done.
