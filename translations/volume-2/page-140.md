δύο, καὶ τὰ στρεπτὰ τῶν στύλων ἐπὶ τῶν κεφαλῶν τῶν στύλων δύο· καὶ
τὰ δίκτυα δύο τοῦ καλύπτειν ἀμφότερα τὰ στρεπτὰ τῶν γλυφῶν τὰ ὄν-
42 τα ἐπὶ τῶν ξύλων. Τὰς ῥοὰς τετρακοσίας ἀμφοτέροις τοῖς δικτύοις, δύο
στίχοι ῥοῶν τῷ δικτύῳ τῷ ἑνί, περικαλύπτειν ἀμφότερα τὰ ὄντα τὰ
43 στρεπτὰ τῆς μεχωνὼθ ἐπ᾿ ἀμφοτέροις τοῖς στύλοις. Καὶ τὰς
μεχωνὼθ δέκα, καὶ τοὺς χυτρογαύλους δέκα ἐπὶ τῆς μεχωνὼθ.
44 Καὶ τὴν θάλασσαν μίαν, καὶ τοὺς βόας δώδεκα ὑποκάτω τῆς θα-
45 λάσσης. Καὶ τοὺς λέβητας, καὶ τὰς θερμαστρεῖς, καὶ τὰς φιά-
λας, καὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη, ἃ ἐποίησε Χειρὰμ τῷ βασιλεῖ Σαλω-
μῶν, τῷ οἴκῳ Κυρίου· καὶ οἱ στύλοι τεσσαράκοντα ὀκτὼ τοῦ οἴ-
κου τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ Κυρίου· πάντα τὰ ἔργα
46 τοῦ βασιλέως ἃ ἐποίησε Χειρὰμ χαλκᾶ ἄρδην. Ἐν τῷ περιείχῳ
τοῦ Ἰορδάνου ἐχώνευσεν αὐτὰ ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐν τῷ πάχει τῆς γῆς,
ἀναμέσον Σοκχώθ, καὶ ἀναμέσον Σοκχώθ, καὶ ἀναμέσον Σιαράμ.
47 Οὐκ ἦν σταθμὸς τοῦ χαλκοῦ οὗ ἐποίησε, πάντα τὰ ἔργα ταῦτα
ἐκ πλήθους σφόδρα, οὐκ ἦν τέρμα τῶν σταθμῶν τοῦ χαλκοῦ ζέοντος.
48 Καὶ ἔδωκεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Σαλωμὼν ἐπὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη·
ἀπὸ τοῦ πλήθους σφόδρα σφόδρα, οὐκ ἦν σταθμὸς τοῦ χαλκοῦ·
καὶ ἐποίησε Σαλωμὼν πάντα τὰ σκεύη τὰ ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ Κυρίου,
τὸ θυσιαστήριον τὸ χρυσοῦν, καὶ τὴν τράπεζαν ἐφ᾿ ἧς οἱ ἄρτοι
49 τῆς προσφορᾶς, χρυσῆν. Καὶ τὰς λυχνίας πέντε ἐκ δεξιῶν, καὶ
πέντε ἐξ ἀριστερῶν κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ δαβείρ, χρυσᾶς, συγ-
κλειομένας, καὶ τὰ λαμπάδια, καὶ τοὺς λύχνους, καὶ τὰς ἐπαρυ-
50 στρίδας χρυσᾶς τρεῖς. Καὶ τὰ πρόθυρα, καὶ οἱ ἦλοι, καὶ αἱ φιάλαι τὰ
τρυβλία, καὶ αἱ θύισκαι χρυσαῖ, συγκλειστά· καὶ τὰ θυρώματα
τῶν θυρῶν τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ ἐσωτάτου ἁγίου ἁγίων, καὶ τὰς θύρας
51 τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ ναοῦ χρυσᾶς. Καὶ ἀνεπληρώθη τὸ ἔργον ὃ ἐποί-
ησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Σαλωμὼν οἴκου Κυρίου· καὶ εἰσήνεγκε Σαλω-
μὼν τὰ ἅγια Δαυὶδ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντα τὰ ἅγια Σα-
λωμὼν, τὸ ἀργύριον, καὶ τὸ χρυσίον, καὶ τὰ σκεύη ἔδωκεν εἰς
τοὺς θησαυροὺς οἴκου Κυρίου.

### A Royal Translation of the Third Book of Kingdoms, Chapter 7

**Chapter 7**

**41** ...two, even the wreathen works for the pillars upon the heads of the pillars, two; and the two networks, to cover both the wreathen carvings that were upon the beams.
**42** The four hundred pomegranates for both the networks, [even] two rows of pomegranates for the one network, to cover both the wreathen works of the base [that were set] upon both the pillars.
**43** And the ten bases, and the ten lavers upon the base.
**44** And the one Sea, and the twelve oxen beneath the Sea.
**45** And the pots, and the shovels, and the bowls, and all the vessels, which Hiram made for King Solomon, for the House of the Lord.
**46** And the pillars, forty-eight, of the king’s house and of the House of the Lord; all the works of the king which Hiram made were wholly of bronze.
**47** In the region of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the thick soil of the land, between Succoth, and between Succoth, and between Zaretan. There was no weight of the bronze which he made, for all these works were of exceeding great abundance; there was no end to the weights of the molten bronze.
**48** And King Solomon provided for all the vessels; from the abundance, exceeding great, there was no weight of the bronze. And Solomon made all the vessels that were in the House of the Lord: the golden altar, and the table whereupon the loaves of the presentation did lie, [which was also] golden.
**49** And the five lampstands on the right hand, and five on the left hand, before the inner sanctuary, [all] of gold, [and they were] closed; and the lamps, and the wicks, and the three golden snuffers.
**50** And the thresholds, and the hinges, and the bowls, [and] the dishes, and the censers, [all] of gold, [and they were] fastened; and the door-frames of the doors of the innermost House, [even] the Holy of Holies, and the doors of the House of the Temple, [all were of] gold.
**51** And the work was completed which King Solomon made for the House of the Lord. And Solomon brought in the holy things of David his father, and all the holy things of Solomon, the silver, and the gold, and the vessels he did give into the treasuries of the House of the Lord.
