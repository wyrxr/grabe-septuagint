¹ ΚΑΙ ἤρξατο Σαλωμὼν τοῦ οἰκοδομεῖν τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου ἐν
Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐν ὄρει τοῦ Ἀμορία, οὗ ὤφθη Κύριος τῷ Δαυὶδ πα-
τρὶ αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ τόπῳ, ᾧ ἡτοίμασε Δαυὶδ ἐν ἅλῳ Ὀρνᾶ τοῦ Ἰε-
βουσαίου.
² Καὶ ἤρξατο οἰκοδομῆσαι ἐν τῷ μηνὶ τῷ δευτέρῳ ἐν τῷ
ἔτει τῷ τετάρτῳ τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ.
³ Καὶ ταῦτα ἤρξατο Σαλωμὼν τοῦ οἰκοδομῆσαι τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Θεοῦ· μῆκος πήχεων, ἡ
διαμέτρησις ἡ πρώτη πήχεων ἑξήκοντα, καὶ εὖρος πήχεων εἴκοσι.
⁴ Καὶ Αἰλὰμ κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ οἴκου, μῆκος ἐπὶ πρόσωπον πλά-
τους τοῦ οἴκου πήχεων εἴκοσι, καὶ ὕψος πήχεων ἑκατὸν εἴκοσι,
καὶ κατεχρύσωσεν αὐτὸν χρυσίῳ καθαρῷ ἔσωθεν.
⁵ Καὶ τὸν οἶκον τὸν μέγαν ἐξύλωσε ξύλοις κεδρίνοις, καὶ κατεχρύσωσε χρυσίῳ κα-
θαρῷ· καὶ ἔγλυψεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῦ φοίνικας καὶ χαλαστά.
⁶ Καὶ ἐκόσμησε τὸν οἶκον λίθοις τιμίοις εἰς δόξαν, καὶ χρυσίῳ χρυσοῦ τοῦ ἐκ Φα-
ρουίμ,

Χερουβεὶμ ἐπὶ τῶν τοίχων.
⁸ Καὶ ἐποίησε τὸν οἶκον τοῦ ἁγίου τῶν ἁγίων μῆκος αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ πρόσωπον πλάτος τοῦ οἴκου, πήχεων εἴ-
κοσι, καὶ τὸ εὖρος πήχεων εἴκοσι, καὶ κατεχρύσωσεν αὐτὸν χρυσίῳ
καθαρῷ εἰς Χερουβείμ, εἰς τάλαντα ἑξακόσια.
⁹ Καὶ ὁλκὴ τῶν ἥλων, ὁλκὴ τοῦ ἑνὸς πεντήκοντα σίκλοι χρυσίου, καὶ τὸ ὑπερῶον ἐχρύ-
σωσεν (ἐν) χρυσίῳ.

¹¹ Καὶ αἱ πτέρυγες τῶν Χερουβείμ, τὸ μῆκος πήχεων εἴκοσι, καὶ ἡ πτέ-
ρυξ ἡ μία πήχεων πέντε, ἀπτομένη τοῦ τοίχου τοῦ οἴκου, καὶ ἡ
πτέρυξ ἡ ἑτέρα πήχεων πέντε, ἀπτομένη τῆς πτέρυγος τοῦ Χε-
ροὺβ τοῦ ἑτέρου.
¹² Καὶ ἡ πτέρυξ τοῦ Χεροὺβ τοῦ ἑνὸς πήχεων πέντε, ἀπτομένη τοῦ τοίχου τοῦ οἴκου, καὶ ἡ πτέρυξ ἡ ἑτέρα πήχεων
πέντε, ἀπτομένη τῆς πτέρυγος τοῦ Χεροὺβ τοῦ ἑτέρου.
¹³ Καὶ πτέ-
ρυγες τῶν Χερουβεὶμ τούτων διαπεπετασμέναι πήχεων εἴκοσι, καὶ
αὐτὰ ἑστηκότα ἐπὶ τοὺς πόδας αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰ πρόσωπα αὐτῶν εἰς
τὸν οἶκον.
¹⁴ Καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ καταπέτασμα ἐξ ὑακίνθου, καὶ πορφύ-
ρας, καὶ κοκκίνου, καὶ βύσσου, καὶ ὕφανεν ἐν αὐτῷ Χερουβείμ.
¹⁵ Καὶ ἐποίησεν ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ οἴκου στύλους δύο πήχεων τριακονταπέντε τὸ ὕψος.

**The Second Book of Chronicles**
**CHAPTER 3**

¹ And Solomon began to build the house of the Lord in Jerusalem upon the Mount of Moriah, where the Lord had appeared unto David his father, in the place which David had prepared in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
² And he began to build in the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.
³ And these are the measurements wherewith Solomon began to build the House of God: the length in cubits, the first measurement, was sixty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.
⁴ And the Ailam before the house, its length in front of the breadth of the house was twenty cubits, and its height one hundred and twenty cubits; and he overlaid it within with pure gold.
⁵ And the great house he paneled with cedar wood, and overlaid it with pure gold; and he carved thereon palm trees and garlands.
⁶ And he adorned the house with precious stones for glory; and with gold, even the gold from Pharuim;
⁷ and he overlaid the house, and the walls, and the gate-posts, and the ceilings, and the doors with gold, and he carved Cherubim upon the walls.
⁸ And he made the House of the Holy of Holies, its length in front of the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and its breadth twenty cubits; and he overlaid it with pure gold for Cherubim, for six hundred talents.
⁹ And the weight of the nails, the weight of each one was fifty shekels of gold; and the upper chamber he overlaid [with] gold.
¹⁰ And in the House of the Holy of Holies he made two Cherubim, a work of wood; and he overlaid them with gold.
¹¹ And the wings of the Cherubim, their length was twenty cubits: and one wing was five cubits, touching the wall of the house; and the other wing was five cubits, touching the wing of the other Cherub.
¹² And the wing of the one Cherub was five cubits, touching the wall of the house; and the other wing was five cubits, touching the wing of the other Cherub.
¹³ And the wings of these Cherubim were spread forth twenty cubits; and they stood upon their feet, and their faces were toward the house.
¹⁴ And he made the veil of hyacinth, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen; and he wove Cherubim into it.
¹⁵ And he made before the house two pillars, thirty-five cubits in height.
