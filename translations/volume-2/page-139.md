πέντε πήχεις μῆκος τῆς Μεχωνὼδ τῆς μιᾶς, καὶ τέσσαρες πήχεις
πλάτος αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐξ ἓν πήχει ὕψος αὐτῆς. Καὶ τοῦτο τὸ ἔργον 28
τῶν Μεχωνώδ, συγκλειστὸν αὐτοῖς, καὶ συγκλειστὸν ἀναμέσον τῶν
ἐξεχομένων. Καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ συγκλείσματα αὐτῶν ἀναμέσον ἐξεχομένων 29
λέοντες καὶ βόες καὶ χερουβείμ· καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν ἐξεχομένων, οὕτω
καὶ ἐπάνωθεν καὶ ὑποκάτωθεν τῶν λεόντων καὶ τῶν βοῶν χῶ-
ραι, ἔργον καταβάσεως. Καὶ τέσσαρες τροχοὶ χαλκοῖ τῇ Μεχω-
νὼθ τῇ μιᾷ, καὶ τὰ προσέχοντα χαλκᾶ, καὶ τέσσαρα μέση αὐτῶν, 30
ὦμίαι αὐτοῖς ὑποκάτω τῶν λουτήρων, αἱ ὦμίαι κεχυμέναι ἀπὸ πέ-
ραν ἀνδρὸς προσκείμεναι. Καὶ στόμα αὐτοῦ ἔσωθεν τῆς κεφα- 31
λίδος ἄνωθεν ἐν πήχει, καὶ στόμα αὐτοῦ στρογγυλοῦν ποίημα
οὕτω πήχεως, καὶ ἡμίσους τοῦ πήχεως· καὶ γε ἐπὶ στόματος
αὐτοῦ διατορεύματα, καὶ διάπηγα αὐτῶν τετράγωνα, οὐ στρογγύ-
λα. Καὶ τέσσαρες τροχοὶ εἰς ὑποκάτωθεν τῶν διαπήγων, καὶ χει- 32
ρες ἐν τοῖς τροχοῖς· ἐν τῇ Μεχωνώθ· καὶ τὸ ὕψος τοῦ τροχοῦ
τοῦ ἑνὸς πήχεως, καὶ ἡμίσους τοῦ πήχεως. Καὶ τὸ ἔργον τῶν 33
τροχῶν ἔργον τροχῶν ἅρματος· αἱ χεῖρες αὐτῶν, καὶ αὐχένες αὐ-
τῶν, καὶ οἱ νῶτοι αὐτῶν, καὶ ἡ πραγματεία αὐτῶν ἴσα πάντα
χωρευτά. Αἱ τέσσαρες ὦμίαι ἐπὶ τῶν τεσσάρων γωνιῶν τῆς με- 34
χωνὼθ τῆς μιᾶς, ἐκ τῆς μεχωνὼθ οἱ ὦμοι αὐτῆς. Καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς 35
κεφαλῆς τῆς μεχωνὼθ ἥμισυ τοῦ πήχεως μέγεθος στρογγύλον κύ-
κλῳ ἐπὶ τῆς κεφαλῆς τῆς μεχωνώθ· καὶ ἀρχὴ χειρῶν αὐτῆς καὶ
τὰ συγκλείσματα αὐτῆς ἐξ αὐτῆς· καὶ ἠνοίγετο ἐπὶ τὰς ἀρχὰς
τῶν χειρῶν αὐτῆς. Καὶ τὰ συγκλείσματα αὐτῆς χερουβείμ, καὶ 36
λέοντες, καὶ φοίνικες, ἑστῶτα, ἐχόμενον ἕκαστον κατὰ πρόσωπον
αὐτοῦ ἔσω καὶ τὰ κυκλόθεν. Κατ᾽ αὐτὴν ἐποίησε πάσας τὰς δέ- 37
κα μεχωνώθ, τάξις μία, καὶ μέτρον ἕν, τέρμα ἕν πάσαις. Καὶ 38
ἐποίησε δέκα χυτρογαύλους χαλκοῦς, τεσσαράκοντα χοεῖς χωροῦν-
τα τὸν χυτρόγαυλον τὸν ἕνα τεσσάρων πηχῶν· ὁ χυτρόγαυλος ὁ
εἷς ἐπὶ τῆς μεχωνὼθ τῆς μιᾶς ταῖς δέκα μεχωνώθ. Καὶ ἔθετο 39
τὰς μεχωνὼδ πέντε ἀπὸ τῆς ὦμίας τοῦ οἴκου ἐκ δεξιῶν, καὶ
πέντε ἐπ᾽ ὦμίαν τοῦ οἴκου ἐξ ἀριστερῶν αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἡ θάλασσα
ἀπὸ τῆς ὦμίδος τοῦ οἴκου ἐκ δεξιῶν κατ᾽ ἀνατολὰς ἀπὸ τοῦ κλί-
τους τοῦ νότου. Καὶ ἐποίησε Χειρὰμ τοὺς λέβητας, καὶ τὰς θερ- 40
μαστρεῖς, καὶ τὰς φιάλας· καὶ συνετέλεσε Χειρὰμ ποιῶν πάντα τὰ
ἔργα ἃ ἐποίησε τῷ βασιλεῖ Σαλωμὼν ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου.

**2. A Royal Translation of the Third Book of Kingdoms, Chapter 7**

**Chapter 7**

**28** ...five cubits was the length of the one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and from one cubit was its height. And this was the work of the bases, [even] enclosed panels for them, and [also] enclosed between the projections.
**29** And upon their enclosures, between the projections, [were graven] lions and oxen and cherubim; and upon the projections, likewise, both above and beneath the lions and the oxen, [were] panels, [wrought with] chased work.
**30** And there were four bronze wheels for the one base, and their attachments [were] of bronze, and four axles [were placed] among them; [and there were] supports for them beneath the lavers, the [same] supports cast [such as extended] from beyond the measure of a man, [and were] affixed.
**31** And its mouth within the capital above, [was] of one cubit, and its mouth, [being] a round work, [was] thus a cubit and half a cubit; and indeed upon its mouth [were] carvings, and their panels [were] four-square, not round.
**32** And four wheels [were placed] beneath the panels, and [there were] spokes in the wheels, within the base; and the height of the one wheel [was] a cubit and half a cubit.
**33** And the work of the wheels [was like] the work of chariot wheels; their spokes, and their hubs, and their felloes, and their construction were all of them cast alike.
**34** The four supports were upon the four corners of the one base; from the base itself were its supports.
**35** And upon the top of the base, half a cubit [was] its round magnitude round about upon the top of the base; and the beginning of its supports and its enclosures [were] from it; and it did unfold upon the commencement of its supports.
**36** And its enclosures [were decorated with] cherubim, and lions, and palm trees, standing; each one situated according to its own aspect, within and round about.
**37** After this manner he made all the ten bases; one pattern, and one measure, one finishing for all of them.
**38** And he made ten bronze lavers, containing forty baths, each one laver of four cubits; the one laver [was placed] upon the one base, [this being so] for all the ten bases.
**39** And he set the bases, five from the side of the house on the right hand, and five toward the side of the house on the left hand thereof; and the Sea [he placed] from the side of the house on the right hand, eastward, from the south side.
**40** And Hiram made the pots, and the shovels, and the bowls; and Hiram finished doing all the works which he made for King Solomon in the House of the Lord.
