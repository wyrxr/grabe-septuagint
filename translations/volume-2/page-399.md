#### THE BOOK OF ESTHER
#### CHAPTER II

<sup>5</sup> of Jairus, the [son] of Semei, the [son] of Kisai, of the tribe of Benjamin;
<sup>6</sup> who was a captive from Jerusalem, whom Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, had led captive.
<sup>7</sup> And he had a foster daughter, the daughter of Aminadab, his father's brother, and her name was Esther. And when her parents had departed this life, he brought her up for himself unto [his] wife.
<sup>8</sup> And the maiden was fair of countenance. And when the king's decree was heard, many maidens were gathered unto Susa the city, under the hand of Gai; and Esther was brought unto Gai, the keeper
<sup>9</sup> of the women. And the maiden pleased him, and she found favour in his sight. And he made haste to give her the ointments and her portion, and the seven maidens appointed unto her from the royal [household]; and he dealt well with her and with her maidens in the women's quarters.
<sup>10</sup> And Esther did not declare her lineage, nor her country; for Mordechai had charged her that she should not declare it.
<sup>11</sup> And daily Mordechai walked by the court of the women's quarters, watching what should happen unto Esther.
<sup>12</sup> And when it was time for a maiden to come in unto the king, when the appointed season—[that is, for] maidens [lasting] twelve months—was to be completed (for thus are the days of purification completed: six months anointed with oil of myrrh, and six months with perfumes and with the ointments of the women),
<sup>13</sup> then she cometh in unto the king. And to whomsoever she should speak, he shall deliver her, [for] her to enter with her, from the women's quarters unto the royal chambers;
<sup>14</sup> in the evening she cometh in, and in the morning she returneth unto the second women's quarters, where Gai, the king's eunuch, the keeper of the women, [was]; and she cometh no more in unto the king, except she be called by name.
<sup>15</sup> Now when the time of Esther, the daughter of Aminadab, the brother of Mordechai's father—whom he had taken for himself as a daughter—was come, that she should go in unto the king, she did not disregard any word of those things which Gogaios, the king's eunuch, the keeper of the women, had told her; for Esther found favour in the sight of all them that beheld her.
<sup>16</sup> So Esther came in unto Artaxerxes the king in the twelfth month, which is Adar, in the seventh year of his
<sup>17</sup> reign. And the king loved Esther, and she found favour beyond all the virgins, and he set upon her the queenly diadem.
<sup>18</sup> And the king made a feast for all his friends and his mighty men for seven days, and he magnified the marriage.

ΚΕΦ. Β΄. ΕΣΘΗΡ. 875
τοῦ Ἰαΐρου, ὁ τοῦ Σεμεΐου, τοῦ Κεισαίου, ἐκ φυλῆς Βενιαμίν, ὃς 6
ἦν αἰχμάλωτος ἐξ Ἱερουσαλήμ, ὃν ᾐχμαλώτευσε Ναβουχοδονόσορ 7
βασιλεὺς Βαβυλῶνος. Καὶ ἦν τούτῳ παῖς θρεπτὴ, θυγάτηρ Ἀμιναδὰβ
ἀδελφοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὸ ὄνομα αὐτῆς Ἐσθήρ· ἐν δὲ
τῷ μεταλλάξαι αὐτῆς τοὺς γονεῖς, ἐπαίδευσεν αὐτὴν αὐτῷ εἰς γυναῖκα· 8
καὶ ἦν τὸ κοράσιον καλὸν τῷ εἴδει. Καὶ ὅτε ἠκούσθη τὸ
τοῦ βασιλέως πρόσταγμα, συνήχθησαν κοράσια πολλὰ εἰς Σοῦσαν
τὴν πόλιν ὑπὸ χεῖρα Γαΐ, καὶ ἤχθη Ἐσθὴρ πρὸς Γαΐ τὸν φύλακα
τῶν γυναικῶν, καὶ ἤρεσεν αὐτῷ τὸ κοράσιον, καὶ εὗρε χάριν ἐνώπιον 9
αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἔσπευσεν αὐτῇ δοῦναι τὸ σμήγμα, καὶ τὴν μερίδα,
καὶ τὰ ἑπτὰ κοράσια τὰ ἀποδεδειγμένα αὐτῇ ἐκ βασιλικοῦ·
καὶ ἐχρήσατο αὐτῇ καλῶς καὶ ταῖς ἄβραις αὐτῆς ἐν τῷ γυναικῶνι.
Καὶ οὐχ ὑπέδειξεν αὐτῆς τὸ γένος Ἐσθὴρ, οὐδὲ τὴν πατρίδα· ὁ 10
γὰρ Μαρδοχαῖος ἐνετείλατο αὐτῇ μὴ ἀπαγγεῖλαι. Καὶ καθ’ ἑκάστην 11
ἡμέραν ὁ Μαρδοχαῖος περιεπάτει κατὰ τὴν αὐλὴν τὴν γυναικείων,
ἐπισκοπῶν τί Ἐσθὴρ συμβαίνει. Καὶ ὅταν ἦν καιρὸς κορασίου 12
εἰσελθεῖν πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα, ὅταν ἀναπληρωθῇ καιρὸς κοράσια
μῆνες δεκαδύο· (οὕτως γὰρ ἀναπληροῦνται αἱ ἡμέραι τῆς θεραπείας
μῆνας ἓξ ἀλειφομένας ἐν μυρινίνῳ ἐλαίῳ, καὶ μῆνας ἓξ ἐν
τοῖς ἀρώμασι, καὶ ἐν τοῖς σμήγμασι τῶν γυναικῶν,) Καὶ τότε 13
εἰσπορεύεται πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα· καὶ ᾧ ἂν εἴπῃ, παραδώσει αὐτὴν
συνεισέρχεσθαι αὐτὴν ἀπὸ τοῦ γυναικῶνος ἕως τῶν βασιλείων, δείλης 14
εἰσπορεύεται, καὶ πρὸς ἡμέραν ἀποτρέχει εἰς τὸν γυναικῶνα τὸν
δεύτερον, οὗ τε Γαΐ ὁ εὐνοῦχος τοῦ βασιλέως ὁ φύλαξ τῶν γυναικῶν,
καὶ οὐκ ἔτι εἰσπορεύεται πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα, ἐὰν μὴ κληθῇ
ὀνομαστί. Ἐν δὲ τῷ ἀναπληροῦσθαι τὸν χρόνον Ἐσθὴρ θυγατρὸς 15
Ἀμιναδὰβ ἀδελφοῦ πατρὸς Μαρδοχαίου ἦν ἔλαβεν αὐτῷ εἰς θυγατέρα
τοῦ εἰσελθεῖν πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα, οὐδὲν ἠθέτησε ῥῆμα ὧν
αὐτῇ ἔλεγε Γογαῖος ὁ εὐνοῦχος τοῦ βασιλέως ὁ φύλαξ τῶν γυναικῶν·
ἦν γὰρ Ἐσθὴρ εὑρίσκουσα χάριν ἐνώπιον πάντων τῶν βλεπόντων
αὐτήν. Καὶ εἰσῆλθεν Ἐσθὴρ πρὸς τὸν Ἀρταξέρξην τὸν 16
βασιλέα τῷ δωδεκάτῳ μηνὶ, ὃς ἐστιν Ἀδὰρ, τῷ ἑβδόμῳ ἔτει τῆς
βασιλείας αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἠράσθη ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἐσθὴρ, καὶ εὗρε χάριν 17
παρὰ πάσας τὰς παρθένους, καὶ ἐπέθηκεν αὐτῇ τὸ διάδημα τὸ γυναικεῖον.
Καὶ ἐποίησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς πότον πᾶσι τοῖς φίλοις αὐτοῦ 18
καὶ ταῖς δυνάμεσιν ἐφ᾽ ἡμέρας ἑπτὰ, καὶ ὕψωσε τοὺς γάμους.
