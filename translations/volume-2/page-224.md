ΚΕΦ. ΙΘʹ.
**3** παροργισμοῦ, ἡ ἡμέρα αὕτη· ὅτι ἦλθον υἱοὶ ἕως ὠδίνων, καὶ ἰσχὺς οὐκ ἔστι τῇ τικτούσῃ·
**4** εἴ πως εἰσακούσεται Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου πάντας τοὺς λόγους Ῥαψάκου, ὃν ἀπέστειλεν αὐτὸν βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων ὁ κύριος αὐτοῦ ὀνειδίζειν Θεὸν ζῶντα, καὶ βλασφημεῖν ἐν λόγοις οἷς ἤκουσε Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου, καὶ λήψῃ προσευχὴν περὶ τοῦ λείμματος τοῦ εὑρισκομένου.
**5** Καὶ ἦλθον οἱ παῖδες τοῦ βασιλέως Ἑζεκίου πρὸς Ἡσαΐαν.
**6** Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς Ἡσαΐας· τάδε ἐρεῖτε πρὸς τὸν κύριον ὑμῶν· τάδε λέγει Κύριος· μὴ φοβοῦ ἀπὸ προσώπου τῶν λόγων ὧν ἤκουσας, ὧν ἐβλασφήμησαν τὰ παιδάρια βασιλέως Ἀσσυρίων ἐμέ·
**7** ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ δίδωμι ἐν αὐτῷ πνεῦμα, καὶ ἀκούσεται ἀγγελίαν, καὶ ἀποστραφήσεται εἰς τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ· καὶ καταβαλῶ αὐτὸν ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ ἐν τῇ γῇ αὐτοῦ.
**8** Καὶ ἀπέστρεψε Ῥαψάκης, καὶ εὗρε τὸν βασιλέα Ἀσσυρίων πολεμοῦντα ἐπὶ Λοβνὰ·
**9** ὅτι ἤκουσεν ὅτι ἀπῆρεν ἀπὸ Λαχείε. Καὶ ἤκουσε περὶ Θαρακὰ βασιλέως Αἰθιόπων, λέγων· ἰδοὺ ἐξῆλθε πολεμεῖν μετὰ σοῦ·
**10** καὶ ἀπέστρεψε, καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ἀγγέλους πρὸς Ἑζεκίαν, λέγων· τάδε ἐρεῖτε πρὸς Ἑζεκίαν βασιλέα Ἰούδα τῷ λέγειν· μὴ ἐπαιρέτω σε ὁ Θεός σου, ἐφ᾽ ᾧ σὺ πέποιθας ἐπ᾽ αὐτῷ, λέγων· οὐ μὴ παραδοθῇ Ἱερουσαλὴμ εἰς χεῖρας βασιλέως Ἀσσυρίων·
**11** ἰδοὺ σὺ ἤκουσας πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησαν βασιλεῖς Ἀσσυρίων πάσαις ταῖς γαίαις τοῦ ἀναθεματίσαι αὐτάς, καὶ σὺ ῥυσθήσῃ;
**12** Μὴ ἐξείλαντο αὐτοὺς οἱ θεοὶ τῶν ἐθνῶν, οὓς διέφθειραν οἱ πατέρες μου, τήν τε Γωζὰν, καὶ τὴν Χαῤῥὰν, καὶ τὴν Ῥαφὲθ, καὶ υἱοὺς Ἐδὲν τοὺς ἐν θαλασσάρ;
**13** Ποῦ ἐστιν ὁ βασιλεὺς Αἰμάθ, καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἀρφὰδ, καὶ βασιλεὺς τῆς πόλεως Σεφφαρουαΐμ, Ἀνὰ, καὶ Αὐά;
**14** Καὶ ἔλαβεν Ἑζεκίας τὰ βιβλία ἐκ χειρὸς τῶν ἀγγέλων, καὶ ἀνέγνω αὐτά· καὶ ἀνέβη εἰς οἶκον Κυρίου, καὶ ἀνέπτυξεν αὐτὰ Ἑζεκίας ἐναντίον Κυρίου.
**15** Καὶ προσηύξατο Ἑζεκίας εἰς πρόσωπον Κυρίου, καὶ εἶπε· Κύριε, ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ, ὁ καθήμενος ἐπὶ τῶν Χερουβείμ, σὺ εἶ ὁ Θεὸς μόνος ἐν πάσαις ταῖς βασιλείαις τῆς γῆς, σὺ ἐποίησας τὸν οὐρανὸν,
**16** καὶ τὴν γῆν, Κλῖνον, Κύριε, τὸ οὖς σου, καὶ ἄκουσον· ἄνοιξον, Κύριε, τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς σου, καὶ ἴδε· καὶ ἄκουσον τοὺς λόγους Σενναχηρείμ οὓς ἀπέστειλεν ὀνειδίζειν Θεὸν ζῶντα.
**17** Ὅτι ἀλήθεια, Κύριε, ἠρήμωσαν βασιλεῖς Ἀσσυρίων τὰ ἔθνη, καὶ τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν,
**18** καὶ ἔδωκαν τοὺς θεοὺς αὐτῶν εἰς τὸ πῦρ, ὅτι οὐ θεοί εἰσιν, ἀλλ᾽ ἢ ἔργα χειρῶν ἀνθρώπων, ξύλα καὶ λίθος· καὶ ἀπώλεσαν αὐτούς.

### Literary Translation:

### 2 Kings 19

**3** provocation; this day it is [indeed]: for the children are come even unto the birth, and there is not strength for her that travaileth.
**4** If so be that the LORD thy God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria, his master, hath sent to reproach the Living God, and to blaspheme with the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore, do thou lift up a prayer for the remnant that is found."
**5** So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
**6** And Isaiah said unto them, "Thus shall ye say to your master: 'Thus saith the LORD, "Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me.
**7** Behold, I will put a spirit in him, and he shall hear a rumor, and shall return unto his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land."'"
**8** So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Lobna;
**9** for he had heard that he [Sennacherib] had departed from Lachish. And when he heard concerning Tirhakah, king of Ethiopia, saying, "Behold, he is come out to fight with thee,"
**10** he turned again, and sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying, "Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying: 'Let not thy God, in Whom thou hast trusted, deceive thee, saying, "Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria."
**11** Behold, thou hast heard all that the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands, utterly destroying them: and shalt thou be delivered?
**12** Have the gods of the nations delivered them, whom my fathers have destroyed, [even] Gozan, and Harran, and Rapheth, and the children of Eden which were in Telassar?
**13** Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, [of] Hena, and Ivah?'"
**14** And Hezekiah received the letters from the hand of the messengers, and read them; and Hezekiah went up into the house of the LORD, and spread them out before the LORD.
**15** And Hezekiah prayed before the face of the LORD, and said, "O LORD, God of Israel, Who sittest upon the Cherubim, Thou art God, [Thou] alone, in all the kingdoms of the earth; Thou hast made the heaven
**16** and the earth. Incline, O LORD, Thine ear, and hear; open, O LORD, Thine eyes, and see; and hear the words of Sennacherib, which he hath sent to reproach the Living God.
**17** For of a truth, O LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations, and their lands,
**18** and have cast their gods into the fire: for they are no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone; therefore have they destroyed them."
