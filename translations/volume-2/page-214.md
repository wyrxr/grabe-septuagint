**7** καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ ἐν πόλει Δαυίδ, καὶ
**8** ἐβασίλευσεν Ἰωάθαμ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ. Ἐν ἔτει τριακοστῷ
καὶ ὀγδόῳ ἔτει τοῦ Ἀζαρίου βασιλέως Ἰούδα ἐβασίλευσεν Ζαχα-
**9** ρίας υἱὸς Ἱεροβοὰμ ἐπὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ ἑξάμηνον. Καὶ ἐποίη-
σε τὸ πονηρὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς Κυρίου, καθὰ ἐποίησαν οἱ πατέρες
αὐτοῦ, οὐκ ἀπέστη ἀπὸ ἁμαρτιῶν Ἱεροβοὰμ υἱοῦ Ναβάτ, ὃς ἐξή-
**10** μαρτε τὸν Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ συνεστράφησαν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν Σελλοὺμ υἱὸς
Ἰαβείς, καὶ Κεβλαάμ, καὶ ἐπάταξαν αὐτὸν (κατέναντι τοῦ λαοῦ,)
**11** καὶ ἐθανάτωσαν αὐτόν· καὶ Σελλοὺμ ἐβασίλευσεν ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ
τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Ζαχαρίου ἰδοὺ ἐστι γεγραμμένα ἐπὶ βιβλίου
**12** λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν Ἰσραήλ. Ὁ λόγος Κυρίου ὃν
ἐλάλησε πρὸς Ἰηοῦ, λέγων, υἱοὶ τέταρτοι καθήσονται σοι ἐπὶ θρό-
**13** νου Ἰσραήλ· καὶ ἐγένετο οὕτως. Καὶ Σελλοὺμ υἱὸς Ἰαβεὶς ἐβα-
σίλευσεν ἐν ἔτει τριακοστῷ καὶ ἐννάτῳ τοῦ Ἀζαρίου βασιλέως
**14** Ἰούδα, ἐβασίλευσε Σελλοὺμ μῆνα ἡμερῶν ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ. Καὶ ἀνέβη
Μαναὴμ υἱὸς Γαδδεὶ ἐκ Θερσιλά, καὶ ἦλθεν εἰς Σαμάρειαν, καὶ
ἐπάταξε τὸν Σελλοὺμ υἱὸν Ἰαβεὶς ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ, καὶ ἐθανάτωσεν
**15** αὐτόν, καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Σελ-
λούμ, καὶ ἡ συστροφὴ αὐτοῦ ᾗ συνεστράφη, ἰδοὺ εἰσι γεγραμμέ-
**16** να ἐπὶ βιβλίου λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν Ἰσραήλ. Τότε
ἐπάταξε Μαναὴμ τὴν Θαιψά, καὶ πάντα τὰ ἐν αὐτῇ, καὶ τὰ ὅρια
αὐτῆς ἀπὸ Θερσά, ὅτι οὐκ ἤνοιξαν αὐτῷ, καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτήν,
**17** καὶ τὰς ἐν γαστρὶ ἐχούσας ἀνέρρηξεν. Ἐν ἔτει τριακοστῷ καὶ ἐν-
νάτῳ Ἀζαρία βασιλέως Ἰούδα (καὶ) ἐβασίλευσε Μαναὴμ υἱὸς Γαδ-
**18** δεὶ ἐπὶ Ἰσραὴλ δέκα ἔτη ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ. Καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ πονηρὸν
ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς Κυρίου, οὐκ ἀπέστη ἀπὸ πασῶν ἁμαρτιῶν Ἱεροβοὰμ
**19** υἱοῦ Ναβάτ, ὃς ἐξήμαρτε τὸν Ἰσραήλ. Ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις αὐτοῦ,
ἀνέβη Φοὺλ βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, καὶ Μαναὴμ ἔδωκε
τῷ Φοὺλ χίλια τάλαντα ἀργυρίου εἶναι τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ σὺν αὐτῷ,
**20** τοῦ ἐνισχύσαι τὸ βασίλειον ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐξήνεγκε Μα-
ναὴμ τὸ ἀργύριον ἐπὶ τὸν Ἰσραήλ, ἐπὶ πᾶν δυνατὸν ἐν ἰσχύϊ, δοῦ-
ναι τῷ βασιλεῖ τῶν Ἀσσυρίων πεντήκοντα σίκλους ἀργυρίου τῷ
**21** ἀνδρὶ τῷ ἑνί. Καὶ ἀπέστρεψε βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων, καὶ οὐκ ἔστη
ἐκεῖ ἐν τῇ γῇ. Καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Μαναὴμ, καὶ πάντα ὅσα
**22** ἐποίησεν, οὐχὶ ταῦτα γεγραμμένα ἐπὶ βιβλίου λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν
τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν Ἰσραήλ; Καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Μαναὴμ μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ.

**Literary Translation:**

### 2 Kings 15

**7** and they buried him with his fathers in the City of David.
**8** And Jotham his son reigned in his stead. In the thirtieth and eighth year of Azariah, king of Judah, Zachariah, the son of Jeroboam, began to reign over Israel in Samaria, [and he reigned for] six months.
**9** And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according as his fathers had done; he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin.
**10** And Shallum, the son of Jabesh, and Kehbalam conspired against him, and smote him (before the people,)
**11** and slew him; and Shallum reigned in his stead. Now the rest of the acts of Zachariah, behold, they are written in the Book
**12** of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. [This was] the word of the LORD, which He spake unto Jehu, saying, "Thy sons of the fourth generation shall sit for thee upon the throne of Israel."
**13** And it came to pass thus. And Shallum, the son of Jabesh, began to reign in the thirty and ninth year of Azariah, king of Judah.
**14** Shallum reigned a full month in Samaria. And Menahem, the son of Gadi, came up from Tirzah, and came to Samaria, and smote Shallum, the son of Jabesh, in Samaria, and slew him,
**15** and reigned in his stead. Now the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy by which he conspired, behold, they are written
**16** in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that was therein, and its borders from Tirzah, because they opened not [their gates] to him; and he smote it,
**17** and the women that were with child he ripped up. In the thirty and ninth year of Azariah, king of Judah, Menahem, the son of Gadi, began to reign over Israel for ten years in Samaria.
**18** And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat,
**19** who caused Israel to sin. In his days, Pul, king of Assyria, came up against the land; and Menahem gave unto Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him,
**20** to strengthen the kingdom in his hand. And Menahem exacted the silver from Israel, from all mighty men of wealth, to give unto the king of Assyria fifty shekels of silver to each man.
**21** And the king of Assyria turned back, and abode not there in the land. Now the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did,
**22** behold, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? And Menahem slept with his fathers.
