808                     ΠΑΡΑΛΕΙΠΟΜΕΝΩΝ                 ΚΕΦ. ΚϚ΄. ΚΖ΄.
                       Ἀζαρίας ὁ ἱερεὺς ὁ πρῶτος καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς, καὶ ἰδοὺ αὐτὸς
                       μετώπῳ, καὶ κατέσπευσαν αὐτὸν ἐκεῖθεν, καὶ γὰρ αὐτὸς ἔσπευσεν
21 ἐξελθεῖν, ὅτι ἤλεγξεν αὐτὸν Κύριος. Καὶ ἦν Ὀζίας ὁ βασιλεὺς
   λεπρὸς ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας τῆς τελευτῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐν οἴκῳ Ἄφρουσὼθ
   ἐκάθητο λεπρός, ὅτι ἀπεσχίσθη ἀπὸ οἴκου Κυρίου. Καὶ Ἰωά-
22 θαμ ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ χρίνων τὸν λαὸν τῆς
   γῆς. Καὶ οἱ λοιποὶ λόγοι Ὀζίου τοῦ βασιλέως, οἱ πρῶτοι καὶ οἱ
23 ἔσχατοι, ἰδοὺ εἰσὶ γεγραμμένοι ὑπὸ Ἰεσσίου τοῦ προφήτου. Καὶ
   ἐκοιμήθη Ὀζίας μετὰ τῶν πατέρων ἑαυτοῦ, καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν
   μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ (μετὰ) τῆς ταφῆς τῶν βα-
   σιλέων, ὅτι εἶπαν, ὅτι λεπρός ἐστι. Καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Ἰωάθαμ ὁ
   υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ.

                       ΚΕΦ. ΚΖ΄. XXVII.

1  Υἱὸς εἴκοσι καὶ πέντε ἐτῶν Ἰωάθαμ ἐν τῷ βασιλεῦσαι αὐ-
   τὸν, καὶ δεκαὲξ ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ὄνομα τῆς
2  μητρὸς αὐτοῦ Ἱερουσά, θυγάτηρ Σαδώχ. Καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ εὐθὲς
   ἐνώπιον Κυρίου, κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν Ὀζίας ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ,
   ἀλλ᾿ οὐκ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸν ναὸν Κυρίου, καὶ ἔτι ὁ λαὸς κατεφθεί-
3  ρετο. Αὐτὸς ᾠκοδόμησε τὴν πύλην οἴκου Κυρίου (καὶ) τὴν ὑψηλήν,
   καὶ ἐν τείχει τοῦ Ὀφλὰ ᾠκοδόμησε πολλά. Καὶ πόλεις ᾠκο-
4  δόμησεν ἐν ὄρει Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐν τοῖς δρυμοῖς, καὶ οἰκήσεις, καὶ πύρ-
   γους. Αὐτὸς ἐμαχέσατο πρὸς βασιλέα υἱῶν Ἀμμὼν, καὶ κατ-
5  ίσχυσεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτόν. καὶ ἐδίδουν αὐτῷ οἱ υἱοὶ Ἀμμὼν κατ᾿ ἐνιαυτὸν
   ἑκατὸν τάλαντα ἀργυρίου, καὶ δέκα χιλιάδας χόρων πυροῦ, καὶ
   κριθῶν δέκα χιλιάδας. ταῦτα ἔφερεν αὐτῷ βασιλεὺς υἱῶν Ἀμμὼν
   κατ᾿ ἐνιαυτὸν, ἐν τῷ πρώτῳ ἔτει καὶ ἐν τῷ δευτέρῳ καὶ τῷ τρίτῳ.
6  Κατίσχυσεν Ἰωάθαμ, ὅτι ἡτοίμασε τὰς ὁδοὺς αὐτοῦ ἐναν-
7  τίον Κυρίου Θεοῦ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ οἱ λόγοι Ἰωάθαμ οἱ λοιποὶ, καὶ ὁ
   πόλεμος, καὶ αἱ πράξεις αὐτοῦ, ἰδοὺ γεγραμμένοι ἐπὶ βιβλίῳ βα-
8  σιλέων Ἰούδα καὶ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ εἴκοσι καὶ πέντε ἐτῶν ἦν βασι-
   λεύσας, καὶ ἓξ καὶ δέκα ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ ἐκοι-
9  μήθη Ἰωάθαμ μετὰ τῶν πατέρων ἑαυτοῦ, καὶ ἐτάφη ἐν πόλει
   Δαυΐδ, καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Ἄχαζ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ.

### English Translation

#### CHAPTER XXVI. [CONTINUED]

²⁰ ...Azariah the chief priest, and the [other] priests; and behold, he [was afflicted] in his forehead. And they hastened him out from thence; yea, he himself hastened to go forth,
²¹ for the Lord had smitten him. And Uzziah the king was leprous until the day of his death, and dwelt, being leprous, in a house of Aphrousoth; for he was cut off from the house of the Lord. And Jotham his son, during his father's reign, did govern the people of the land.
²² Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah the king, both the first and the last,
²³ behold, they are written by Isaiah the prophet. So Uzziah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the field, [yet apart from] the burial of the kings; because they said, "He is leprous." And Jotham his son reigned in his stead.

#### CHAPTER XXVII.

¹ Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and sixteen years reigned he in Jerusalem. And the name of his mother was Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok.
² And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that Uzziah his father had done; yet he entered not into the temple of the Lord. And still the people did corrupt themselves.
³ He built the gate of the house of the Lord, [even] the high [gate]; and upon the wall of the Ophel he built much.
⁴ Moreover, cities he built in the mountain of Judah, and in the forests, and dwellings, and towers.
⁵ He fought also against the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed against him. And the Ammonites gave unto him, year by year, a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand measures of barley. These things did the king of the Ammonites bring unto him year by year, in the first year, and in the second, and in the third.
⁶ So Jotham prevailed, because he prepared his ways before the Lord his God.
⁷ Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and his wars, and his deeds, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
⁸ And he was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and sixteen years reigned he in Jerusalem.
⁹ And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David. And Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.
