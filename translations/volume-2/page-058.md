36 ἔως σφόδρα, καὶ οὐκ ἀπήγγειλεν αὐτῷ ῥῆμα μικρὸν ἢ μέγα ἕως
37 φωτὸς τοῦ πρωΐ. Καὶ ἐγένετο πρωΐ, ὡς ἐξένηψεν ἀπὸ τοῦ οἴνου
Νάβαλ, ἀπήγγειλεν ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα· καὶ ἐνα-
πέθανεν ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ ἐν αὐτῷ, καὶ αὐτὸς γίνεται ὡσεὶ λίθος.
38 Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡσεὶ δέκα ἡμέραι, καὶ ἐπάταξε Κύριος τὸν Νάβαλ,
39 καὶ ἀπέθανε. Καὶ ἤκουσε Δαυὶδ ὅτι ἀπέθανε Νάβαλ, καὶ εἶπεν·
Εὐλογητὸς Κύριος, ὃς ἔκρινε τὴν κρίσιν τοῦ ὀνειδισμοῦ ἐμοῦ ἐκ
χειρὸς τοῦ Νάβαλ, καὶ τὸν δοῦλον αὐτοῦ περιεποιήσατο ἐκ χει-
ρὸς κακῶν, καὶ τὴν κακίαν Νάβαλ ἀπέστρεψε Κύριος εἰς κεφα-
λὴν αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἀπέστειλε Δαυὶδ καὶ ἐλάλησε περὶ ᾿Αβιγαίας,
40 λαβεῖν αὐτὴν ἑαυτῷ εἰς γυναῖκα. Καὶ ἦλθον οἱ παῖδες Δαυὶδ πρὸς
᾿Αβιγαίαν εἰς Κάρμηλον, καὶ ἐλάλησαν αὐτῇ, λέγοντες· Δαυὶδ ἀ-
41 πέστειλεν ἡμᾶς πρὸς σὲ λαβεῖν σε αὐτῷ εἰς γυναῖκα. Καὶ ἀνέ-
στη καὶ προσεκύνησεν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, καὶ εἶπεν· ἰδοὺ
ἡ δούλη σου εἰς παιδίσκην νίψαι πόδας τῶν παίδων τοῦ κυρί-
42 ου μου. Καὶ ἐτάχυνε καὶ ἀνέστη ᾿Αβιγαία, καὶ ἐπέβη ἐπὶ τὴν
ὄνον, καὶ πέντε κοράσια ἠκολούθουν αὐτῇ, καὶ ἐπορεύθη ὀπίσω
τῶν παίδων Δαυίδ, καὶ γίνεται αὐτῷ εἰς γυναῖκα.
43 Καὶ τὴν ᾿Αχινὰμ ἔλαβε Δαυὶδ ἐξ ᾿Ιεζραέλ, καὶ ἦσαν ἀμφότεραι αὐτῷ γυναῖκες.
44 Καὶ Σαοὺλ ἔδωκε Μελχὸλ τὴν θυγατέρα αὐτοῦ τὴν γυναῖκα Δαυὶδ τῷ Φαλτὶ υἱῷ Λαῒς τῷ ἐκ Γαλλείμ.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΣ΄.

1 ΚΑὶ ἔρχονται οἱ Ζιφαῖοι ἐκ τῆς αὐχμώδους πρὸς τὸν Σαοὺλ
εἰς τὸν βουνόν, λέγοντες· ἰδοὺ Δαυὶδ σκεπάζεται παρ᾿ ἡμῖν ἐν
τῷ βουνῷ τοῦ ᾿Εχελά, τοῦ κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ ᾿Ιεσσαιμοῦ.
2 Καὶ ἀνέστη Σαοὺλ καὶ κατέβη εἰς τὴν ἔρημον Ζείφ, καὶ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ
τρεῖς χιλιάδες ἀνδρῶν ἐκλεκτῶν ἐξ ᾿Ισραήλ, ζητεῖν τὸν Δαυὶδ ἐν
τῇ ἐρήμῳ Ζείφ.
3 Καὶ παρενέβαλε Σαοὺλ ἐν τῷ βουνῷ τοῦ ᾿Εχελὰ τοῦ ἐπὶ προσώπου τοῦ ᾿Ιεσσαιμοῦ ἐπὶ τῆς ὁδοῦ, καὶ Δαυὶδ ἐκάθισεν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ. Καὶ εἶδε Δαυίδ, ὅτι ἥκει Σαοὺλ ὀπίσω
4 αὐτοῦ εἰς τὴν ἔρημον. Καὶ ἀπέστειλε Δαυὶδ κατασκόπους, καὶ
5 ἔγνω ὅτι ἥκει Σαοὺλ ἕτοιμος ἐκ Κειλά. Καὶ ἀνέστη Δαυὶδ λά-
θρα, καὶ πορεύεται εἰς τὸν τόπον οὗ ἐκάθευδεν ἐκεῖ Σαούλ, καὶ
ἐκεῖ ᾿Αβεννήρ, υἱὸς Νήρ, ἀρχιστράτηγος αὐτοῦ. Καὶ Σαοὺλ ἐκά-
