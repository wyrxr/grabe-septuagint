ΚΕΦ. ΛϚʹ. ΤΩΝ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ ΙΟΥΔΑ Βʹ. 829
πατέρων αὐτῶν ἐν χειρὶ προφητῶν αὐτοῦ, ὀρθρίζων καὶ ἀποστέλ-
λων τοὺς ἀγγέλους ἑαυτοῦ, ὅτι ἦν φειδόμενος τοῦ λαοῦ ἑαυτοῦ, καὶ
τοῦ ἁγιάσματος αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἦσαν μυκτήριζοντες ἀγγέλους αὐτοῦ, 16
καὶ ἐξουθενοῦντες τοὺς λόγους αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐμπαίζοντες ἐν τοῖς προ-
φήταις αὐτοῦ, ἕως ἀνέβη θυμὸς Κυρίου ἐν τῷ λαῷ αὐτοῦ, ἕως οὐκ
ἦν ἴαμα. Καὶ ἤγαγεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς βασιλέα Χαλδαίων, καὶ ἀπέκτει- 17
νε τοὺς νεανίσκους αὐτῶν ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ ἐν οἴκῳ ἁγιάσματος αὐτοῦ.
καὶ οὐκ ἐφείσατο τοῦ Σεδεκίου, καὶ τὰς παρθένους αὐτῶν οὐκ ἠλέη-
σε, καὶ τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους αὐτῶν ἀπήγαγον, τὰ πάντα παρέδωκεν
ἐν χερσὶν αὐτῶν· καὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη οἴκου τοῦ Θεοῦ τὰ μεγάλα 18
καὶ τὰ μικρά, καὶ τοὺς θησαυροὺς οἴκου Κυρίου, καὶ πάντας τοὺς
θησαυροὺς τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ μεγιστάνων πάντα εἰσήνεγκεν εἰς Βα-
βυλῶνα. Καὶ ἐνέπρησε τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου, καὶ κατέσκαψε τὸ τεῖ- 19
χος Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ τὰς βάσεις αὐτῆς ἐνέπρησεν ἐν πυρί, καὶ
πᾶν σκεῦος ὡραῖον εἰς ἀφανισμόν. Καὶ ἀπώκισε τοὺς καταλοί- 20
πους εἰς Βαβυλῶνα, καὶ ἦσαν αὐτῷ καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ εἰς δού-
λους ἕως βασιλείας Μήδων, τοῦ πληρωθῆναι λόγον Κυρίου διὰ στό- 21
ματος Ἱερεμίου, ἕως τοῦ προσδέξασθαι τὴν γῆν τὰ σάββατα αὐ-
τῆς σαββατίσαι, πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς ἐρημώσεως αὐτῆς ἐσαβ-
βάτισεν εἰς συμπλήρωσιν ἐτῶν ἑβδομήκοντα. Ἔτους πρώτου Κύ- 22
ρου βασιλέως Περσῶν, μετὰ τὸ πληρωθῆναι ῥῆμα Κυρίου διὰ στό-
ματος Ἱερεμίου, ἐξήγειρε Κύριος τὸ πνεῦμα Κύρου βασιλέως Περ-
σῶν, καὶ παρήγγειλε τοῦ κηρύξαι αὐτοὺς ἐν πάσῃ τῇ βασιλείᾳ
αὐτοῦ ἐν γραπτῷ, λέγων· τάδε λέγει Κῦρος βασιλεὺς Περσῶν· 23
πάσας τὰς βασιλείας τῆς γῆς ἔδωκέ μοι Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ οὐρα-
νοῦ, καὶ αὐτὸς ἐνετείλατό μοι οἰκοδομῆσαι αὐτῷ οἶκον ἐν Ἱερου-
σαλήμ ἐν τῇ Ἰουδαίᾳ. τίς ἐξ ὑμῶν ἐκ παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ;
ἔσται ὁ Θεὸς αὐτοῦ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀναβήτω.
Παραλειπομένων τῶν βασιλειῶν Ἰούδα β´ τέλος.

**Chapter 36**

¹⁵...of their fathers by the hand of His prophets, rising early and sending His messengers; for He had compassion upon His people, and upon His sanctuary.

¹⁶ But they mocked God's messengers, and despised His words, and scorned His prophets, until the Lord's wrath rose against His people, till there was no remedy.

¹⁷ Therefore He brought upon them the king of the Chaldeans, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of His sanctuary, and spared not Zedekiah, nor had compassion upon their virgins, and led away their elders; all things did He deliver into their hands.

¹⁸ And all the vessels of God's house, great and small, and the treasures of the Lord's house, and all the treasures of the king and of his magnates, all these he brought into Babylon.

¹⁹ And he burned the Lord's house, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem, and burned its foundations with fire, and every precious vessel did he consign to utter destruction.

²⁰ And he carried away the remnant into Babylon; and they were servants to him and to his sons until the reign of the Medes,

²¹ to fulfill the Lord's word by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land might enjoy her sabbaths, [and] keep her sabbath; all the days of her desolation she kept sabbath, until the completion of seventy years.

²² Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, after the Lord's word by the mouth of Jeremiah had been fulfilled, the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, and he commanded to make them known by proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and also in writing, saying:

²³ Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: All the kingdoms of the earth has the Lord God of Heaven given to me; and He Himself has charged me to build Him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whosoever among you of all His people, may his God be with him, and let him go up.
