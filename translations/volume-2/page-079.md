### Chapter 6

**14** ...instruments well-tuned before the Lord; and David was clothed with a linen ephod.
**15** And David and all the house of Israel brought up the Ark of the Lord with a shout and with the sound of a trumpet.
**16** And it came to pass, as the Ark of the Lord came unto the City of David, that Michal, the daughter of Saul, looked out through the window, and saw King David playing [upon instruments] and dancing before the Lord; and she despised him in her heart.
**17** And they brought the Ark of the Lord, and set it in its place, in the midst of the tent which David had pitched for it. And David offered up burnt offerings before the Lord, and peace offerings.
**18** And David finished offering up the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, and blessed the people in the Name of the Lord of Hosts.
**19** And he distributed unto all the people, to all the multitude of Israel, from Dan even unto Beersheba, both to man and to woman, to every one a cake of bread, and a fried cake [made] from the pan, and a grill-cake. And all the people departed, every one to his own house.
**20** And David returned to bless his household; and Michal, the daughter of Saul, went out to meet David, and blessed him [sarcastically], and said, "How glorious is the King of Israel today, who hath uncovered himself today in the eyes of the maidservants of his own servants, as one uncovereth himself without shame among the dancers!"
**21** And David said unto Michal, "Before the Lord, Who chose me above thy father and above all his house, to appoint me as ruler over His people, over Israel,
**22** I will play and dance before the Lord, and I will be still more uncovered in this manner; and I shall be despised in thine eyes, yet with the maidservants of whom thou hast spoken, shall I be glorified."
**23** And unto Michal, the daughter of Saul, there was no child unto the day of her death.
