ΚΕΦ. Ε΄. ΤΩΝ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ ΙΟΥΔΑ Β΄.
πληγὴν, καὶ πάντα πόνον, καὶ πᾶσα προσευχὴ, καὶ πᾶσα δέησις 29
ἣ ἐὰν γένηται παντὶ ἀνθρώπῳ, καὶ παντὶ λαῷ σου Ἰσραὴλ, ἐὰν
γνῷ ἄνθρωπος τὴν ἀφὴν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὴν μαλακίαν αὐτοῦ, καὶ διαπετάσῃ
τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦτον, καὶ σὺ εἰσακούσῃ 30
ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ἐξ ἑτοίμου κατοικητηρίου σου, καὶ ἐλάσῃ, καὶ δώ-
σεις ἀνδρὶ κατὰ τὰς ὁδοὺς αὐτοῦ, ὡς ἂν γνῷς τὴν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ,
ὅτι μονώτατος γινώσκεις τὴν καρδίαν υἱῶν ἀνθρώπων, ὅπως φο- 31
βῶνται τὰς ὁδούς σου πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας ἃς αὐτοὶ ζῶσιν ἐπὶ προ-
σώπου πάσης τῆς γῆς, ἧς ἔδωκας τοῖς πατράσιν ἡμῶν. Καὶ πᾶς 32
ἀλλότριος, ὃς οὐκ ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ σου Ἰσραὴλ ἐστιν αὐτὸς, καὶ ἔλθῃ
ἐκ γῆς μακρόθεν διὰ τὸ ὄνομά σου τὸ μέγα, καὶ τὴν χεῖρά σου τὴν
κραταιὰν, καὶ βραχίονά σου τὸν ὑψηλὸν, καὶ ἔλθωσι καὶ προσεύ-
ξωνται εἰς τὸν τόπον τοῦτον, καὶ σὺ εἰσακούσῃ ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ἐξ 33
ἑτοίμου κατοικητηρίου σου, καὶ ποιήσεις κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἂν ἐπι-
καλέσηταί σε ὁ ἀλλότριος, ὅπως γνῶσι πάντες οἱ λαοὶ τῆς γῆς
τὸ ὄνομά σου, καὶ τοῦ φοβεῖσθαί σε, ὡς ὁ λαός σου Ἰσραὴλ, τοῦ
γνῶναι ὅτι ἐπικέκληται τὸ ὄνομά σου ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον τοῦτον, ὃν
ᾠκοδόμησα. Ἐὰν δὲ ἐξέλθῃ ὁ λαός σου εἰς πόλεμον ἐπὶ τοὺς 34
ἐχθροὺς αὐτοῦ ἐν ὁδῷ ᾗ ἀποστελεῖς αὐτοὺς, καὶ προσεύξωνται
πρὸς σὲ κατὰ τὴν ὁδὸν τῆς πόλεως ταύτης ἣν ἐξελέξω ἐν αὐτῇ,
καὶ οἴκου οὗ ᾠκοδόμησα τῷ ὀνόματί σου, καὶ ἀκούσῃ ἐκ τοῦ οὐ- 35
ρανοῦ τῆς δεήσεως αὐτῶν καὶ τῆς προσευχῆς αὐτῶν, καὶ ποιήσεις
τὸ δικαίωμα αὐτῶν. Ὅτι ἁμαρτήσονταί σοι, ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν ἄν- 36
θρωπος ὃς οὐχ ἁμαρτήσεται, καὶ πατάξεις αὐτοὺς, καὶ παραδώ-
σεις αὐτοὺς κατὰ πρόσωπον ἐχθρῶν, καὶ αἰχμαλωτεύσουσιν αὐτοὺς
οἱ αἰχμαλωτεύοντες αὐτοὺς εἰς γῆν ἐχθρῶν, εἰς γῆν μακρὰν ἢ ἐγ- 37
γὺς, καὶ ἐπιστρέψουσι καρδίαν αὐτῶν ἐν τῇ γῇ αὐτῶν οὗ μετήχθη-
σαν ἐκεῖ, καί γε ἐπιστρέψωσι, καὶ δεηθῶσί σου ἐν τῇ αἰχμαλωσίᾳ
αὐτῶν, λέγοντες· ἡμάρτομεν, ἠδικήσαμεν, ἠνομήσαμεν· καὶ ἐπι- 38
στρέψωσι πρὸς σὲ ἐν ὅλῃ καρδίᾳ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐν ὅλῃ ψυχῇ αὐτῶν
ἐν γῇ αἰχμαλωτευσάντων αὐτοὺς, ὅπου ἠχμαλώτευσαν αὐτοὺς,
καὶ προσεύξωνται ὁδὸν γῆς αὐτῶν ἧς ἔδωκας τοῖς πατράσιν αὐ-
τῶν, καὶ τῆς πόλεως ἧς ἐξελέξω, καὶ τοῦ οἴκου οὗ ᾠκοδόμησα
τῷ ὀνόματί σου, καὶ ἀκούσῃ ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ἐξ ἑτοίμου κατοικη- 39
τηρίου σου τῆς προσευχῆς αὐτῶν, καὶ τῆς δεήσεως αὐτῶν, καὶ
ποιήσεις κρίματα, καὶ ἵλεως ἔσῃ τῷ λαῷ τῷ ἁμαρτόντι σοι. Νῦν, 40

CHAPTER 5. OF THE KINGDOMS OF JUDAH II.

²⁹ [And for] every plague, and every pain, and every prayer, and every supplication that shall be made by any man, and by all Thy people Israel, if a man shall know his affliction and his sickness, and spread forth his hands toward this house;
³⁰ then Thou shalt hear from heaven, from Thy established dwelling place, and shalt judge, and shalt give unto every man according to his ways, as Thou knowest his heart; for Thou only knowest the heart of the sons of men,
³¹ that they may fear Thy ways all the days that they live upon the face of all the earth which Thou gavest unto our fathers.
³² Moreover, concerning every stranger who is not of Thy people Israel, and he shall come from a far country for Thy great Name's sake, and Thy strong hand, and Thy high arm, and they shall come and pray toward this place;
³³ then Thou shalt hear from heaven, from Thy established dwelling place, and shalt do according to all things whatsoever the stranger shall call upon Thee for; that all the peoples of the earth may know Thy Name, and to fear Thee, as Thy people Israel [doth], to know that Thy Name is called upon this house which I have built.
³⁴ And if Thy people go out to war against their enemies in the way wherein Thou shalt send them, and they pray unto Thee toward the path of this city which Thou hast chosen therein, and of the house which I have built unto Thy Name;
³⁵ then Thou shalt hear from heaven their supplication and their prayer, and shalt execute their right.
³⁶ For they shall sin against Thee, for there is no man who shall not sin, and Thou shalt smite them, and shalt deliver them before the face of their enemies, and those that take them captive shall take them captive into the land of their enemies, into a land far or near;
³⁷ and they shall turn their heart in their land whither they were carried away, yea, and if they turn and make supplication unto Thee in their captivity, saying, "We have sinned, we have dealt unjustly, we have acted lawlessly;"
³⁸ and they shall turn unto Thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of them that have taken them captive, where they were taken captive, and shall pray toward the path of their land which Thou gavest unto their fathers, and of the city which Thou hast chosen, and of the house which I have built unto Thy Name;
³⁹ then Thou shalt hear from heaven, from Thy established dwelling place, their prayer and their supplication, and shalt execute judgments, and shalt be merciful unto Thy people who have sinned against Thee.
⁴⁰ Now,
