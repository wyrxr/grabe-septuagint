ΚΕΦ. Ι΄. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Α΄. 499
Σαμουὴλ παντὶ τῷ λαῷ πρὸς Κύριον εἰς Μασσηφάθ. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς 18
υἱοὺς Ἰσραήλ· τάδε εἶπε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ, λέγων· ἐγὼ ἀνήγαγον
τὸν Ἰσραὴλ ἐξ Αἰγύπτου, καὶ ἐξειλάμην ὑμᾶς ἐκ χειρὸς Φαραὼ
βασιλέως Αἰγύπτου, καὶ ἐκ πασῶν τῶν βασιλέων τῶν ἐκθλιβουσῶν ὑμᾶς.
Καὶ ὑμεῖς σήμερον ἐξουδενώκατε τὸν Θεὸν ὑμῶν, ὃς αὐτός ἐστι σωτὴρ 19
ὑμῶν ἐκ πάντων τῶν κακῶν ὑμῶν καὶ θλίψεων ὑμῶν, καὶ εἴπατε·
οὐχί, ἀλλ᾽ ἢ βασιλέα στήσεις ἐφ᾽ ὑμῶν. Καὶ νῦν κατάστητε ἐνώπιον
Κυρίου κατὰ τὰ σκῆπτρα ὑμῶν καὶ κατὰ τὰς χιλιάδας ὑμῶν.
Καὶ προσήγαγε Σαμουὴλ πάντα τὰ σκῆπτρα Ἰσραήλ, καὶ κατακληροῦται 20
σκῆπτρον Βενιαμείν·
φυλὴ Ματταρεί· καὶ προσάγουσιν τὴν φυλὴν Ματταρεὶ εἰς ἄνδρας, 21
καὶ κατακληροῦται Σαοὺλ υἱὸς Κείσ· καὶ ἐζήτει αὐτόν, καὶ οὐχ
εὑρίσκετο.
Καὶ ἐπηρώτησεν ἔτι Σαμουὴλ ἐν Κυρίῳ· εἰ ἔρχεται ἔτι ἐνταῦθα 22
ἀνήρ; Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος· ἰδοὺ αὐτὸς κέκρυπται ἐν ταῖς σκευέσι.
Καὶ ἔδραμε καὶ λαμβάνει αὐτὸν ἐκεῖθεν, καὶ κατέστησεν ἐν μέσῳ 23
τοῦ λαοῦ· καὶ ὑψώθη ὑπὲρ πάντα τὸν λαὸν ὑπερωμίαν καὶ ἐπάνω.
Καὶ εἶπε Σαμουὴλ πρὸς ἅπαντα τὸν λαόν· εἰ ἑωράκατε ὃν ἐκλέλεκται 24
ἑαυτῷ Κύριος, ἔτι οὐκ ἔστιν ὅμοιος αὐτῷ ἐν πᾶσιν ὑμῖν; Καὶ ἔγνωσαν
πᾶς ὁ λαός, καὶ ζήτω, εἶπαν, ὁ βασιλεύς.
Καὶ εἶπε Σαμουὴλ πρὸς τὸν λαὸν τὸ δικαίωμα τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ 25
ἔγραψεν ἐν βιβλίῳ, καὶ ἔθηκεν ἐνώπιον Κυρίου· καὶ ἐξαπέστειλε
Σαμουὴλ πάντα τὸν λαόν, καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ἕκαστος εἰς τὸν τόπον αὐτοῦ.
Καὶ Σαοὺλ ἀπῆλθεν εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ εἰς Γαβαά· καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν 26
υἱοὶ δυνάμενοι, ὧν ἥψατο Κύριος καρδίας αὐτῶν, μετὰ Σαούλ.
Καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ λοιμοὶ εἶπαν· τίς σώσει ἡμᾶς οὗτος; καὶ ἠτίμασαν αὐτόν, 27
καὶ οὐκ ἤνεγκαν αὐτῷ δῶρα.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΑ΄. ΧΙ.

ΚΑΙ ἐγενήθη ὡς μετὰ μῆνα, καὶ ἀνέβη Νάας ὁ Ἀμανίτης, 1
καὶ παρεμβάλλει ἐπὶ Ἰαβεὶς Γαλαάδ. Καὶ εἶπαν πάντες οἱ ἄνδρες
Ἰαβεὶς πρὸς Νάας τὸν Ἀμανίτην· διάθου ἡμῖν διαθήκην, καὶ
δουλεύσομέν σοι.
Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτοὺς Νάας ὁ Ἀμανίτης· ἐν ταύτῃ τῇ διαθήκῃ 2
διαθήσομαι ὑμῖν, ἐν τῷ ἐξορύξαι ὑμῶν πάντα τὸν ὀφθαλμὸν δεξιόν,
καὶ θήσομαι αὐτὸν ὄνειδος ἐπὶ πάντα Ἰσραήλ.

**1 Kings, Chapter 10**

18 unto all the people to the Lord in Mizpah. And he said unto the sons of Israel, "Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, saying: 'I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you out of the hand of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and out of the hand of all the kings that oppressed you.
19 And ye yourselves this day have rejected your God, who is Himself your saviour from all your evils and from your afflictions; and ye have said, "Nay, but a king shalt thou set over us." Now therefore present yourselves before the Lord, by your tribes and by your thousands.'"
20 And Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel, and the tribe of Benjamin was chosen by lot.
21 the tribe of Matri. And they brought the tribe of Matri by its men, and Saul the son of Kish was chosen by lot; and they sought him, but he could not be found.
22 And Samuel inquired yet again of the Lord, "Is the man yet come hither?" And the Lord said, "Behold, he hath hidden himself among the baggage."
23 And he ran and fetched him thence, and set him in the midst of the people; and he was taller than all the people by a shoulder and upward.
24 And Samuel said unto all the people, "Have ye seen him whom the Lord hath chosen for Himself? Is there none like him among all of you?" And all the people knew, and they said, "Long live the king!"
25 Then Samuel told the people the ordinance of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the Lord. And Samuel sent all the people away, and every man departed unto his own place.
26 And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him the sons of might, whose hearts the Lord had touched, with Saul.
27 But the sons of Belial said, "How shall this man save us?" And they despised him, and brought him no presents.

**1 Kings, Chapter 11**

1 And it came to pass after about a month, that Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabesh-Gilead. And all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash the Ammonite, "Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee."
2 And Nahash the Ammonite said unto them, "On this condition will I make a covenant with you: that I may gouge out every man's right eye from among you, and lay it as a reproach upon all Israel."
