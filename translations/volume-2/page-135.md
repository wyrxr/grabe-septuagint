**3** Καὶ τὸ αἴθλαμ κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ ναοῦ τοῦ οἴκου, καὶ εἴκοσιν ἐν πήχει μῆκος αὐτοῦ κατὰ πρόσωπον εἰς τὸ ὕψος τοῦ οἴκου· δέκα πήχεις πλάτος αὐτοῦ κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ οἴκου· καὶ ᾠκοδόμησε τὸν οἶκον, καὶ συνετέλεσεν αὐτόν.
**4** Καὶ ἐποίησε τῷ οἴκῳ θυρίδας παρακυπτομένας κρυπτάς.
**5** Καὶ ἔδωκεν ἐπὶ τὸν τοῖχον τοῦ οἴκου μέλαθρα κυκλόθεν σὺν τοίχοις τοῦ οἴκου κυκλόθεν τῷ ναῷ καὶ τὸ δαβείρ. Καὶ ἐποίησε πλευρὰς κυκλόθεν.
**6** Ἡ πλευρὰ ἡ ὑποκάτω ἓξ πήχεων τὸ πλάτος αὐτῆς, καὶ τὸ μέσον ἓξ πήχεων πλάτος, καὶ ἡ τρίτη ἑπτὰ ἐν πήχει τὸ πλάτος αὐτῆς· ὅτι διαστήματα ἔδωκε τῷ οἴκῳ κυκλόθεν ἔξωθεν τοῦ οἴκου, ὅπως μὴ ἐπιλαμβάνωνται τῶν τοίχων τοῦ οἴκου.
**7** Καὶ ὁ οἶκος ἐν τῷ οἰκοδομεῖσθαι αὐτὸν λίθοις ἀκροτόμοις ἀργοῖς ᾠκοδομήθη· καὶ σφύρα, καὶ πέλεκυς, καὶ πᾶν σκεῦος σιδηροῦν οὐκ ἤκουστο ἐν τῷ οἰκοδομεῖσθαι αὐτόν.
**8** Καὶ ὁ πυλὼν τῆς πλευρᾶς τῆς ὑποκάτωθεν ὑπὸ τὴν ὠμίαν τοῦ οἴκου τὴν δεξιάν, καὶ εἰλικτὴ ἀνάβασις εἰς τὸ μέσον, καὶ ἐκ τῆς μέσης ἐπὶ τὰ τριώροφα.
**9** Καὶ ᾠκοδόμησε τὸν οἶκον, καὶ συνετέλεσεν αὐτόν· καὶ ἐκοιλοστάθμησε τὸν οἶκον φατνώσει καὶ διατάξεσι, κέδροις.
**10** Καὶ ᾠκοδόμησε τοὺς ἐνδέσμους δι᾽ ὅλου τοῦ οἴκου πέντε ἐν πήχει τὸ ὕψος αὐτοῦ, καὶ συνέσχε τὸν ἔνδεσμον ἐν ξύλοις κεδρίνοις.
**11** Καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς Σαλωμών, λέγων·
**12** Ὁ οἶκος οὗτος ὃν σὺ οἰκοδομεῖς, ἐὰν ἐξέρχῃ τοῖς προστάγμασί μου, καὶ τὰ κρίματά μου ποιῇς, καὶ φυλάσσῃς πάσας τὰς ἐντολάς μου ἀναστρέφεσθαι ἐν αὐταῖς, στήσω τὸν λόγον μου σὺν σοὶ ὃν ἐλάλησα πρὸς Δαυίδ τὸν πατέρα σου.
**13** Καὶ κατασκηνώσω ἐν μέσῳ υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ οὐκ ἐγκαταλείψω τὸν λαόν μου Ἰσραήλ.
**14** Καὶ ᾠκοδόμησε Σαλωμὼν τὸν οἶκον, καὶ συνετέλεσεν αὐτόν.
**15** Καὶ ᾠκοδόμησε τοὺς τοίχους τοῦ οἴκου ἔσωθεν διὰ ξύλων κεδρίνων ἀπὸ τοῦ ἐδάφους τοῦ οἴκου, καὶ ἕως τῶν τοίχων, καὶ ἕως τῶν δοκῶν· ἐκοιλοστάθμησε συνεχομένα ξύλοις ἔσωθεν· καὶ περιέσχε τὸ ἔσω τοῦ οἴκου ἐν πλευραῖς πευκίναις.
**16** Καὶ ᾠκοδόμησε τοὺς εἴκοσι πήχεις ἀπ᾽ ἄκρου τοῦ τοίχου τὸ πλευρὸν τὸ ἓν ἀπὸ τοῦ ἐδάφους τοῦ οἴκου, ἕως τῶν δοκῶν· καὶ ἐποίησεν αὐτῷ ἔσωθεν τοῦ δαβείρ εἰς τὸ ἅγιον τῶν ἁγίων.
**17** Καὶ τεσσαράκοντα πηχῶν ἦν ὁ οἶκος· οὗτος ὁ ναὸς ὁ ἐσώτατος.
**18** Καὶ διὰ κέδρου πρὸς τὸν οἶκον ἔσω πλοκὴν ἐπαναστάσεις, καὶ πέταλα, καὶ ἀνάγλυφα πάντα κέδρινα· οὐκ ἐφαίνετο λίθος·
**19** κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ δαβείρ, ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ οἴκου ἔσωθεν ἡτοίμασε δοῦναι ἐκεῖ τὴν κιβωτὸν διαθήκης Κυρίου.

**A Royal Translation of the Third Book of Kingdoms, Chapter 6**

**3** And the porch before the temple of the house, the length thereof was twenty cubits according to the front toward the height of the house; and the breadth thereof ten cubits according to the front of the house. And he built the house, and finished it.
**4** And he made for the house windows that were recessed and hidden.
**5** And he set against the wall of the house rafters all around, with the walls of the house all around for the nave and the inner sanctuary. And he made side chambers all around.
**6** The lowest side chamber, the breadth thereof was six cubits; and the middle [one], six cubits in breadth; and the third [one], seven cubits in breadth: because he made offsets for the house round about, on the outside of the house, so that [the beams thereof] might not take hold of the walls of the house.
**7** And the house, when it was being built, was built of stones perfectly dressed, [yet] unworked; and hammer, nor axe, nor any tool of iron was heard, when it was being built.
**8** And the door of the lowest side chamber was at the right side of the house, and a winding stair ascended to the middle [story], and from the middle [story] unto the third story.
**9** And he built the house, and finished it; and he covered the house with wainscoting and courses, [all of] cedar.
**10** And he built the girders throughout the house, five cubits was the height thereof; and he secured the girder with cedar timbers.
**11** And the word of the Lord came unto Solomon, saying:
**12** "This house which thou buildest, if thou walkest forth in My statutes, and performest My judgments, and observest all My commandments to conduct thyself in them, then will I establish My word with thee, which I spake unto David thy father.
**13** And I will dwell in the midst of the sons of Israel, and I will not forsake My people Israel."
**14** So Solomon built the house, and finished it.
**15** And he built the walls of the house within with cedar timbers, from the floor of the house, even unto the walls, and unto the roof-beams; he paneled [them], held fast with timbers within; and he covered the interior of the house with fir-wood planks.
**16** And he built the space of twenty cubits from the innermost wall, [even] the one partition, from the floor of the house, up to the roof-beams; and he made [it] within, [to be] the inner sanctuary, [which is] the Holy of Holies.
**17** And the house [before the sanctuary] was forty cubits [long]; this was the innermost nave.
**18** And throughout the house within, [there was] cedar with interwoven relief-work, and flowers, and carved-work, all of cedar; no stone was visible.
**19** Before the inner sanctuary, in the midst of the house within, he prepared to place there the ark of the covenant of the Lord.
