**ΚΕΦ. ΛΓ´. XXXIII.**

19 ἐν πολέμῳ. Πάλιν δὲ ἤλεγξεν αὐτὸν ἐν μαλακίᾳ ἐπὶ κοίτης,
20 καὶ πλῆθος ὀστέων αὐτοῦ ἐνάρκησε· πᾶν δὲ βρωτὸν σίτου οὐ
   μὴ δύνηται προσδέξασθαι, καὶ ἡ ψυχὴ αὐτοῦ βρῶσιν ἐπιθυμήσει·
21 ἕως ἂν σαπῶσιν αὐτοῦ αἱ σάρκες, καὶ ἀποδείξῃ τὰ ὀστᾶ
22 αὐτοῦ κενά· ἐγγίσῃ δὲ ἡ ψυχὴ αὐτοῦ εἰς θάνατον, ἡ δὲ ζωὴ
23 αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ ᾅδῃ. Ἐὰν ὦσι χίλιοι ἄγγελοι θανατηφόροι, εἷς ἐξ
   αὐτῶν οὐ μὴ τρώσῃ αὐτόν. Ἐὰν νοήσῃ τῇ καρδίᾳ ἐπιστραφῆναι
   ἐπὶ τὸν Κύριον, ἀναγγείλῃ δὲ ἀνθρώπῳ τὴν ἑαυτοῦ μέμψιν,
24 καὶ τὴν ἄνοιαν αὐτοῦ δείξῃ· ἀνθέξεται αὐτοῦ, τοῦ μὴ πεσεῖν αὐτὸν
   εἰς θάνατον, ἀνανεώσει δὲ αὐτοῦ τὸ σῶμα, ὥσπερ ἀλοιφὴν
25 ἐπὶ τοίχου, καὶ τὰ ὀστᾶ αὐτοῦ ἐμπλήσει μυελοῦ· ἀπαλυνεῖ δὲ
   αὐτοῦ τὰς σάρκας ὥσπερ νηπίου, καὶ ἀποκαταστήσει αὐτὸν ἀνδρωθέντα
   ἐν ἀνθρώποις. Εὔξεται πρὸς Κύριον, καὶ δεκτὰ αὐτῷ
26 ἔσται, εἰσελεύσεται δὲ προσώπῳ καθαρῷ σὺν ἐξηγορίᾳ· ἀποδώσει
   δὲ ἀνθρώπῳ τὴν δικαιοσύνην αὐτοῦ. Εἶτα τότε ἀπομέμψεται
   ἄνθρωπος αὐτὸς ἑαυτῷ, λέγων· οἷα συνετελούμην; καὶ
27 οὐκ ἄξια ἤτασέ με ὧν ἥμαρτον. Σῶσον τὴν ψυχήν μου, τοῦ
28 μὴ ἐλθεῖν εἰς διαφθοράν, καὶ ἡ ζωή μου φῶς ὄψεται. Ἰδού,
29 ταῦτα πάντα ἐργᾶται ὁ ἰσχυρὸς ὁδοὺς τρεῖς μετὰ ἀνδρός· καὶ
30 ἐῤῥύσατο τὴν ψυχήν μου ἐκ θανάτου, ἵνα ἡ ψυχή μου ἐν φωτὶ
   αἰνῇ αὐτόν. (Ὑπολαβὼν δὲ Ἐλιοὺς, λέγει· ἀκούσατέ μου σοφοὶ,
   ἐπιστάμενοι ἐνωτίζεσθε τὸ καλόν· ὅτι εἴρηκεν Ἰώβ· ἰδοὺ, ταῦτα
   πάντα ἐργᾶται ὁ ἰσχυρὸς ὁδοὺς τρεῖς μετὰ ἀνδρὸς, τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι
   ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ ἐκ διαφθοράς, τοῦ φωτίσαι αὐτῷ ἐν φωτὶ
31 ζώντων.) Πρόσεχε Ἰὼβ, καὶ ἄκουσόν μου, κώφευσον, καὶ ἐγὼ
32 λαλήσω. Εἰ εἰσί σοι λόγοι, ἀποκρίθητί μοι, λάλησον, θέλω γὰρ
33 σὲ δικαιωθῆναι· εἰ δέ μὴ, σὺ ἄκουσόν μου, κώφευσον, καὶ διδάξω
   σε σοφίαν.

**ΚΕΦ. ΛΔ´. XXXIV.**

1.2 ὙΠΟΛΑΒΩΝ δὲ Ἐλιοὺς λέγει· ἀκούσατε ῥήματά μου σοφοὶ,
3  ἐπιστάμενοι ἐνωτίζεσθε (τὸ καλόν)· ὅτι οὓς δοκιμάζει λόγους,
   λάρυγξ δὲ γεύεται βρῶσιν.
4  Κρίσιν ἑλώμεθα ἑαυτοῖς· γνῶμεν ἀνὰ μέσον αὐτῶν, τί καλόν.
5  Ὅτι εἴρηκεν Ἰώβ· δίκαιός εἰμι, καὶ ὁ
6  Κύριος ἀπήλλαξέ μου τὸ κρίμα, καὶ ἐψεύσατο τῷ κρίματί μου·

## CHAPTER XXXIII. (continued)

**19** In war. But again He hath chastised him with weakness upon [his] bed;
**20** and the multitude of his bones grew numb; and he shall not be able to receive any food of wheat, yet his soul shall long for nourishment,
**21** until his flesh decayeth, and his bones he shall reveal, [being] bare;
**22** and his soul shall draw nigh unto death, and his life unto Hades.
**23** If there be a thousand angels of death, yet not one of them shall wound him. If he perceiveth in his heart to turn again unto the Lord, and doth declare unto a man his own fault,
**24** and maketh plain his folly; then shall He restrain him, that he fall not into death, and He shall renew his body, as a smooth plaster upon a wall,
**25** and his bones shall He fill with marrow; and He shall make his flesh tender as [the flesh of] a child, and shall restore him, [fully] matured, among men.
**26** He shall pray unto the Lord, and it shall be acceptable unto Him; and he shall come forth with a pure countenance with [his] confession; and He shall restore unto man his righteousness.
**27** Then shall a man blame himself, saying: 'What manner of things have I wrought?
**28** [He did] not chastise me according to the measure of my sin. Save my soul from going into corruption, and my life shall behold light.'
**29** Behold!
**30** All these things the Mighty One worketh in three ways with a man; and He hath delivered my soul from death, that my soul might praise Him in light.
    (Then Elihu answered and said: 'Hearken unto me, ye wise, ye that are knowing, give ear unto that which is good; for Job hath said: "Behold, all these things the Mighty One doeth in three ways with a man, to turn his soul from corruption, to enlighten him in the light of the living."')
**31** Attend, O Job, and hearken unto me; be thou silent, and I will speak.
**32** If thou hast words, answer me, speak; for I desire thee to be justified.
**33** But if not, do thou hearken unto me; be silent, and I will teach thee wisdom.

## CHAPTER XXXIV.

**1.2** Then Elihu answered and said:
    "Hearken unto my words, ye wise,
**3** ye that are knowing, give ear unto (that which is good);
    for [even as] words are tried, so doth the gullet taste food.
**4** Let us choose judgment for ourselves; let us discern among them what is good.
**5** For Job hath said: 'I am righteous,
**6** and the Lord hath taken away my right, and hath dealt falsely with my judgment;
