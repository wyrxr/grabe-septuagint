ΚΕΦ. ΙΗʹ. ΙΘʹ.
32 ριος ἔσωσεν αὐτὸν, καὶ ἀπέστρεψεν αὐτοὺς ὁ Θεὸς ἀπ᾽ αὐτοῦ.
33 Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἴδον οἱ ἄρχοντες τῶν ἁρμάτων ὅτι οὐκ ἦν βασιλεὺς
    Ἰσραὴλ, ἀπέστρεψαν ἀπ᾽ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἀνὴρ ἐνέτεινε τόξον εὐστό-
    χως, καὶ ἐπάταξε τὸν βασιλέα Ἰσραὴλ ἀναμέσον τοῦ πνεύμονος,
    καὶ ἀναμέσον τοῦ θώρακος· καὶ εἶπε τῷ ἡνιόχῳ· ἐπίστρεφε τὴν χεῖ-
34 ρά σου, καὶ ἐξάγαγέ με ἐκ τοῦ πολέμου, ὅτι ἐπόνεσα. Καὶ ἐπρο-
    πώθη ὁ πόλεμος ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ ἦν
    ἑστηκὼς ἐπὶ τοῦ ἅρματος ἕως ἑσπέρας ἐξ ἐναντίας Συρίας, καὶ
    ἀπέθανε δύνοντος τοῦ ἡλίου.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΘʹ. ΧΙΧ.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐπέστρεψεν Ἰωσαφὰτ βασιλεὺς Ἰούδα εἰς τὸν οἶκον ἑαυ-
2 τοῦ τὸν ἐν εἰρήνῃ εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν εἰς ἀπάντησιν αὐτοῦ
    Ἰηοῦ ὁ τοῦ Ἀνανὶ ὁ προφήτης· καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· βασιλεῦ Ἰωσα-
    φὰτ, εἰ ἁμαρτωλῷ σὺ βοηθεῖς, ἢ μισουμένῳ ὑπὸ Κυρίου φιλιάζεις;
3 διὰ τοῦτο ἐγένετο ἐπὶ σὲ ὀργὴ παρὰ Κυρίου· ἀλλ᾽ ἢ λόγοι ἀγα-
    θοὶ εὑρέθησαν ἐν σοὶ, ὅτι ἐξῆρας τὰ ἄλση ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς Ἰούδα, καὶ
4 κατηύθυνας τὴν καρδίαν σου ἐκζητῆσαι τὸν Κύριον. Καὶ κατώκη-
    σεν Ἰωσαφὰτ ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ, καὶ πάλιν ἐξῆλθεν εἰς τὸν λαὸν ἀπὸ
    Βηρσαβεὲ ἕως ὄρους Ἐφραὶμ, καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ Κύριον
5 Θεὸν τῶν πατέρων αὐτῶν. Καὶ κατέστησε κριτὰς ἐν πάσαις ταῖς
6 πόλεσιν Ἰούδα ταῖς ὀχυραῖς, ἐν πόλει καὶ πόλει. Καὶ εἶπε τοῖς
    κριταῖς· ἴδετε τί ὑμεῖς ποιεῖτε, ὅτι οὐκ ἀνθρώπῳ ὑμεῖς κρίνετε,
7 ἀλλ᾽ ἢ τῷ Κυρίῳ, καὶ μεθ᾽ ὑμῶν λόγοι τῆς κρίσεως. Καὶ νῦν γε-
    νέσθω φόβος Κυρίου ἐφ᾽ ὑμᾶς, καὶ φυλάσσετε, καὶ ποιήσατε, ὅτι
    οὐκ ἔστι μετὰ Κυρίου Θεοῦ ἡμῶν ἀδικία, οὐδὲ θαυμάσαι πρόσω-
8 πον, οὐδὲ λαβεῖν δῶρα. Καὶ γε ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ κατέστησεν Ἰω-
    σαφὰτ τῶν ἱερέων, καὶ τῶν Λευιτῶν, καὶ τῶν πατριαρχῶν Ἰσραὴλ
    εἰς κρίσιν Κυρίου, καὶ κρίνειν τοὺς κατοικοῦντας ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ.
9 Καὶ ἐνετείλατο πρὸς αὐτοὺς, λέγων· οὕτως ποιήσετε ἐν φόβῳ Κυ-
10 ρίου, ἐν ἀληθείᾳ, καὶ ἐν πλήρει καρδίᾳ, πᾶς ἀνὴρ κρίσιν τὴν ἐλ-
    θοῦσαν πρὸς ὑμᾶς τῶν ἀδελφῶν ὑμῶν τῶν κατοικούντων ἐν ταῖς
    πόλεσιν αὐτῶν ἀναμέσον αἷμα αἵματος, καὶ ἀναμέσον προστάγ-
    ματος καὶ ἐντολῆς, καὶ δικαιώματα καὶ κρίματα· καὶ διαστελεῖ-
    σθε αὐτοῖς, καὶ οὐχ ἁμαρτήσονται τῷ Κυρίῳ, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ἐφ᾽

**Chapter 18**

³² the Lord saved him; and God turned them away from him.
³³ And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from him. And a certain man drew a bow with full aim, and smote the king of Israel between the lung and the breastplate. And [Ahab] said to the driver of his chariot, "Turn thine hand, and lead me forth from the battle, for I am sorely wounded."
³⁴ And the battle waxed sore that day, and the king of Israel stood up in his chariot until the evening, over against Syria; and he died when the sun did set.

**Chapter 19**

¹ And Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, returned to his house in peace, to Jerusalem.
² And Jehu the son of Hanani, the prophet, went forth to meet him, and said unto him, "O King Jehoshaphat, shouldest thou help the wicked, or befriend those hated by the Lord?
³ Therefore is wrath come upon thee from the Lord. Nevertheless, good things have been found in thee, for thou hast taken away the groves out of the land of Judah, and hast prepared thy heart to seek the Lord."
⁴ And Jehoshaphat dwelt in Jerusalem. And again he went forth among the people, from Beersheba even unto Mount Ephraim, and brought them back unto the Lord God of their fathers.
⁵ And he set judges in all the fortified cities of Judah, in every city.
⁶ And he said to the judges, "Take heed what ye do; for ye judge not for man, but for the Lord, and with you are the words of judgment.
⁷ Now therefore, let the fear of the Lord be upon you. Take heed and do it, for with the Lord our God there is no iniquity, nor respect of persons, nor taking of gifts."
⁸ Moreover, in Jerusalem, Jehoshaphat appointed of the priests, and of the Levites, and of the patriarchs of Israel for the judgment of the Lord, and to judge those who dwell in Jerusalem.
⁹ And he charged them, saying, "Thus shall ye do in the fear of the Lord, in truth, and with a perfect heart: concerning every matter of judgment that shall come unto you from your brethren who dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, and between statute and commandment, and ordinances and judgments;
¹⁰ and ye shall instruct them, and they shall not sin against the Lord, and there shall not be upon..."
