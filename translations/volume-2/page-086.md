3 τος· καὶ ἡ γυνὴ καλὴ τῷ εἴδει σφόδρα. Καὶ ἀπέστειλε Δαυίδ,
  καὶ ἐζήτησε τὴν γυναῖκα, καὶ εἶπεν· οὐχὶ αὕτη Βηρσαβεέ, ἡ θυ-
4 γάτηρ Ἐλιάβ, ἡ γυνὴ Οὐρίου τοῦ Χετταίου; Καὶ ἀπέστειλε Δαυίδ
  ἀγγέλους, καὶ ἔλαβεν αὐτήν, καὶ εἰσῆλθε πρὸς αὐτήν, καὶ ἐκοιμή-
  θη μετ᾿ αὐτῆς. Καὶ αὕτη ἁγιαζομένη ἀπὸ ἀκαθαρσίας αὐτῆς,

  βεν ἡ γυνή· καὶ ἀποστείλασα ἀπήγγειλε τῷ Δαυίδ, καὶ εἶπεν·
6 ἐγώ εἰμι ἐν γαστρὶ ἔχω. Καὶ ἀπέστειλε Δαυίδ πρὸς Ἰωάβ, λέ-

### Chapter 11

**3** And the woman was exceedingly beautiful to look upon. And David sent and enquired concerning the woman, and he said, Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliab, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?

**4** And David sent messengers, and took her; and he came in unto her, and lay with her. And she, being purified from her uncleanness,

**5** returned (her) unto her house. And the woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said, I have conceived.

**6** And David sent unto Joab, saying, Send unto me Uriah the Hittite.

**7** And Joab sent Uriah unto David. And Uriah came unto him; and David enquired of the peace of Joab, and of the peace of the people, and of the peace of the war.

**8** And David said unto Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uriah went out of the king’s house, and there went out after him a provision from the king’s house.

**9** But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s house with the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.

**10** And they told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto his house. And David said unto Uriah, Art thou not come from a journey? Why then didst thou not go down unto thine house?

**11** And Uriah said unto David, (If) the ark, and Israel, and Judah dwell in tents, and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord encamp in the open field, shall I then go into mine house to eat, and to drink, and to lie with my wife? (And) how [can this be]? As thy soul liveth, [I will not do] this thing.

**12** And David said unto Uriah, Tarry here this day also, and tomorrow I will send thee away. And Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the next day.

**13** And David called him, and he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk. And he went out in the evening to lie down, (and) [even] upon his couch with the servants of his lord,

**14** and went not down to his house. And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter unto Joab, and sent (David) [it] by the hand of

**15** Uriah. And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the fierce battle, and retreat ye from behind him, that he may be smitten, and die.

**16** And it came to pass, as Joab kept watch over the city, that he put Uriah in the place where
