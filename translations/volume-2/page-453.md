1 ΜΕΤΑ δὲ τὸ παύσασθαι Ἐλιοῦν τῆς λέξεως εἶπεν ὁ Κύριος
2 τῷ Ἰὼβ διὰ λαίλαπος καὶ νέφους· τίς οὗτος ὁ κρύπτων με βου-
3 λὴν, συνέχων δὲ ῥήματα ἐν καρδίᾳ, ἐμὲ δὲ οἴεται κρύπτειν; Ζῶ-
4 σαι ὥσπερ ἀνὴρ τὴν ὀσφύν σου· ἐρωτήσω δέ σε, σὺ δέ μοι ἀπο-
5 κρίθητι. Ποῦ ἦσθα ὅτε ἐθεμελίωσα τὴν γῆν; ἀνάγγειλόν μοι εἰ
6 ἐπίστασαι σύνεσιν. Τίς ἔθετο τὰ μέτρα αὐτῆς, εἰ οἶδας; ἢ τίς
7 ὁ ἐπαγαγὼν σπαρτίον ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς; Ἐπὶ τίνος (δὲ) οἱ κρίκοι αὐ-
8 τῆς πεπήγασι; Τίς δέ ἐστιν ὁ βαλὼν λίθον γωνιαῖον (ἐπ᾿) αὐ-
9 τῆς; Ὅτε ἐγενήθη ἄστρα, ἤνεσάν με ἐν φωνῇ μεγάλῃ πάντες
10 ἄγγελοί μου (καὶ ὕμνησαν). Ἔφραξα δὲ θάλασσαν πύλαις, ὅτε
11 ἐμαίοῦτο, καὶ ἐκ κοιλίας μητρὸς αὐτῆς ἐξεπορεύετο· ἔθεμην δὲ
12 αὐτῇ νέφος ἀμφίασιν, ὀμίχλη δὲ αὐτὴν ἐσπαργάνωσα· ἔθεμην
13 δὲ αὐτῇ ὅρια, περιθεὶς κλεῖθρα καὶ πύλας· εἶπον δὲ αὐτῇ· μέχρι
14 τούτου ἐλεύσῃ, καὶ οὐχ ὑπερβήσῃ, ἀλλ᾿ ἐν σεαυτῇ συντριβήσε-
15 ταί σου τὰ κύματα. Ἢ ἐπὶ σοῦ συντέταχα φέγγος πρωϊνόν;
16 Ἑωσφόρος δὲ οἶδε τὴν ἑαυτοῦ τάξιν, ἐπιλαβέσθαι πτερύγων γῆς,
17 καὶ ἐκτινάξαι ἀσεβεῖς ἐξ αὐτῆς; Ἢ σὺ λαβὼν γῆν πηλὸν ἔπλα-
18 σας ζῶον; καὶ λαλητὸν αὐτὸ ἔθου ἐπὶ γῆς; Ἀφείλω δὲ ἀπὸ
19 ἀσεβῶν τὸ φῶς; καὶ βραχίονα ὑπερηφάνων συνέτριψας; Ἦλθες
20 δὲ ἐπὶ πηγὴν θαλάσσης; ἐν δὲ ἴχνεσιν ἀβύσσου περιεπάτησας;
21 Ἀνοίγονται δέ σοι φόβῳ πύλαι θανάτου; πυλωροὶ δὲ ᾅδου ἰδόν-
22 τες σε ἔπτηξαν; Νουθέτησαι δὲ τὸ εὖρος τῆς ὑπ᾿ οὐρανόν;
23 ἀνάγγειλον δέ μοι, πόση ἥτις ἐστίν. Ἐν ποίᾳ δὲ γῆ ἀυλίζεται
24 φῶς; σκότους δὲ ποῖός ἐστι τόπος; Εἰ ἄρα ἀγάγοις με εἰς ὅρια
25 αὐτῶν; εἰ δὲ καὶ ἐπίστασαι τρίβους αὐτῶν; Οἶδας ἄρα, ὅτι
26 τότε γεγέννησαι, ἀριθμὸς δὲ ἐτῶν σου πολύς; Ἦλθες δὲ ἐπὶ
27 θησαυροὺς χιόνος; θησαυροὺς δὲ χαλάζης ἑώρακας; Ἀπόκειν-
28 ται δέ (σοι) εἰς ὥραν ἐχθρῶν, εἰς ἡμέραν πολέμου καὶ μάχης.
29 Πόθεν δὲ ἐκπορεύεται πάχνη, ἢ διασκεδάννυται νότος εἰς τὴν
30 ὑπ᾿ οὐρανόν; Τίς δὲ ἡτοίμασεν ὑετῷ λάβρῳ ῥύσιν, ὁδὸν δὲ
31 κυδοιμῷ; Τοῦ ὑετίσαι ἐπὶ γῆν οὗ οὐκ ἀνὴρ, ἔρημον οὗ οὐχ
32 ὑπάρχει ἄνθρωπος ἐν αὐτῇ· τοῦ χορτάσαι ἄβατον καὶ ἀοίκητον,
33 καὶ τοῦ ἐκβλαστῆσαι ἔξοδον χλόης. Τίς ἐστιν ὑετοῦ πατήρ; τίς

## CHAPTER XXXVIII.

**1** Then after Elihu had ceased from his speech, the LORD spake unto Job out of a whirlwind and a cloud, saying,
**2** "Who is this that obscureth counsel from Me, holding back [his] words in his heart, and supposeth he can hide [aught] from Me?
**3** Gird up thy loins now like a man; I will question thee, and do thou answer Me.
**4** Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare unto Me, if thou knowest understanding.
**5** Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? Or who stretched the line upon it?
**6** Whereupon (then) are the bases thereof fastened? Or who is he that laid the corner-stone (upon) it?
**7** When the stars were made, all My angels praised Me with a great voice (yea, and hymned Me).
**8** And I shut in the sea with gates, when it was being delivered, and issued forth from its mother's womb;
**9** And I appointed for it a cloud as raiment, and I swaddled it with mist;
**10** And I appointed for it its bounds, surrounding it with bars and gates;
**11** And I said unto it, 'Hitherto shalt thou come, and no further shalt thou pass; but within thyself shall thy waves be broken.'
**12** Or hast thou ordered the morning light, [as if it were given] unto thy charge? Doth the Morning Star know its own appointed order, to lay hold upon the wings of the earth,
**13** and to shake out the wicked from it? Or hast thou, taking the earth as clay, fashioned a living creature?
**14** And made it a speaking thing upon the earth? Hast thou taken away the light from the wicked?
**15** And hast thou crushed the arm of the proud? Hast thou come to the springs of the sea?
**16** Or hast thou walked in the depths of the abyss? Are the gates of death opened unto thee in fear?
**17** Or do the gatekeepers of Hades tremble at thy sight? Art thou then instructed concerning the breadth of the space beneath the heaven?
**18** Declare unto Me then, how great it is. In what land then doth light make its dwelling?
**19** And what is the place of darkness? If then thou couldst lead Me to their boundaries?
**20** Yea, and if thou knowest their paths? Knowest thou then, that thou wast born at that time, and that the number of thy years is great?
**21** Hast thou then come to the treasuries of the snow? And hast thou beheld the treasuries of the hail?
**22** And are they then laid up (for thee) against the time of enemies, against the day of war and battle?
**23** From whence then cometh the hoarfrost, or from where is the south wind scattered under the heaven?
**24** And who hath prepared a channel for the raging rain, and a way for the tempest?
**25** To cause it to rain upon a land where no man is, upon a wilderness where no human dwelleth therein;
**26** to satisfy the desolate and uninhabited [place], and to cause the growth of grass to spring forth.
**27** Who is the father of the rain?"
