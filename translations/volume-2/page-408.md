ΕΣΘΗΡ. ΚΕΦ. Ζ'. Η'.
3 Καὶ ἀποκριθεῖσα, εἶπεν· εἰ εὗρον χάριν ἐνώπιον τοῦ βασιλέως δοθήτω ἡ ψυχή τῷ αἰτήματί μου, καὶ ὁ λαός μου τῷ ἀξιώματί μου.
4 Ἐπράθημεν γὰρ ἐγώ τε καὶ ὁ λαός μου εἰς ἀπώλειαν, καὶ διαρπαγήν, καὶ δουλείαν, ἡμεῖς καὶ τὰ τέκνα ἡμῶν εἰς παῖδας καὶ παιδίσκας, καὶ παρήκουσα· οὐ γὰρ ἄξιος ὁ διάβολος τῆς αὐλῆς τοῦ
5 βασιλέως. Εἶπε δὲ ὁ βασιλεὺς· τίς οὗτος, ὃς τις ἐτόλμησε ποιῆσαι τὸ πρᾶγμα τοῦτο;
6 Εἶπε δὲ Ἐσθήρ· ἄνθρωπος ἐχθρὸς Ἀμὰν ὁ πονηρὸς οὗτος. Ἀμὰν δὲ ἐταράχθη ἀπὸ τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ τῆς
7 βασιλίσσης. Ὁ δὲ βασιλεὺς ἐξανέστη ἐκ τοῦ συμποσίου εἰς τὸν κῆπον· ὁ δὲ Ἀμὰν παρητεῖτο τὴν βασίλισσαν· ἑώρα γὰρ αὐτὸν ἐν
8 κακοῖς ὄντα. Ἐπέστρεψε δὲ ὁ βασιλεὺς ἀπὸ τοῦ κήπου. Ἀμὰν δὲ ἐπιπεπτωκὼς (καὶ ἔπεσεν) ἐπὶ τὴν κλίνην, ἀξιῶν αὐτήν· εἶπε δὲ ὁ βασιλεύς· ὥστε καὶ τὴν γυναῖκα ἐκβιάζει ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ μου; Ἀμὰν
9 δὲ ἀκούσας, διετράπη τῷ προσώπῳ. Εἶπε δὲ Βουγαθὰν εἷς τῶν εὐνούχων πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα· ἰδοὺ καὶ τὸ ξύλον ὃ ἡτοίμασεν Ἀμὰν Μαρδοχαίῳ τῷ λαλήσαντι περὶ τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ ὠρθωται ἐν τοῖς Ἀμὰν πηχῶν πεντήκοντα. εἶπε δὲ ὁ βασιλεύς· σταυρωθήτω
10 ἐπ’ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐκρεμάσθη Ἀμὰν ἐπὶ τοῦ ξύλου οὗ ἡτοίμασε Μαρδοχαίῳ· καὶ τότε ἐκόπασεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τοῦ θυμοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. Η'. VIII.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐν αὐτῇ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἀρταξέρξης ἐδωρήσατο Ἐσθὴρ ὅσα ὑπῆρχεν Ἀμὰν τῷ διαβόλῳ, καὶ Μαρδοχαῖος δὲ προσεκλήθη ὑπὸ τοῦ βασιλέως. ὑπέδειξε γὰρ Ἐσθήρ, ὅτι ἐνοικεῖται
2 αὐτῇ. Ἔλαβε δὲ ὁ βασιλεὺς τὸν δακτύλιον ὃν ἀφείλατο τοῦ Ἀμὰν, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὸν Μαρδοχαίῳ, καὶ κατέστησεν Ἐσθὴρ Μαρδοχαῖον ἐπὶ πάντων τῶν Ἀμάν.
3 Καὶ προσθεῖσα ἐλάλησε πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα, καὶ προσέπεσε πρὸς τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἠξίου ἀφελεῖν τὴν Ἀμὰν κακίαν, καὶ ὅσα ἐποίησε τοῖς Ἰουδαίοις.
4 Καὶ ἐξέτεινεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἐσθὴρ τὴν ῥάβδον τὴν χρυσῆν· ἐξηγέρθη δὲ
5 Ἐσθὴρ παρεστηκέναι τῷ βασιλεῖ. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἐσθήρ· εἰ δοκεῖ σοι, καὶ εὗρον χάριν ἐνώπιόν σου, πεμφθήτω ἀποστρέψαι τὰ γράμματα τὰ ἐξαπεσταλμένα ὑπὸ Ἀμάν, τὰ γραφέντα ἀπολέσθαι τοὺς Ἰουδαίους, ὅσοι εἰσὶν ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ σου. πῶς γὰρ δυνήσομαι ἐπιδεῖν τὴν κάκωσιν τοῦ λαοῦ μου, καὶ πῶς δυνήσομαι σωθῆναι

### Chapter 7

3 And she answered and said, "If I have found grace in the sight of the king, let my life be given unto my petition, and my people unto my request.

4 For we have been sold, both I and my people, to destruction, and to plunder, and to servitude, even we and our children to be menservants and maidservants; and I failed to heed: for the Adversary is not worthy of the king's court."

5 Then said the king, "Who is this, who hath dared to do this thing?"

6 And Esther said, "The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman!" Then Haman was troubled before the king and the queen.

7 And the king rose up from the banquet into the garden; but Haman entreated the queen, for he saw that he was in evil plight.

8 And the king returned from the garden. And Haman had fallen upon the couch (yea, he fell) entreating her. Then said the king, "Will he also force the queen in my own house?" And Haman, when he heard this, was confounded in his countenance.

9 Then said Bugathan, one of the chamberlains, unto the king, "Behold, the gallows also, which Haman prepared for Mordecai, who spake concerning the king, standeth erected at Haman's [house], being fifty cubits high." Then the king said, "Let him be impaled thereon!"

10 So Haman was hanged upon the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. And then the king's wrath was appeased.

### Chapter 8

1 Now on that very day did King Artaxerxes bestow upon Esther all that belonged unto Haman the Devil. And Mordecai also was called before the king, for Esther had shown that he dwelt with her.

2 And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther appointed Mordecai over all the possessions of Haman.

3 And Esther spoke yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and earnestly besought him to turn away the evil of Haman, and all that he had devised against the Jews.

4 And the king held forth the golden scepter toward Esther. So Esther arose and stood before the king.

5 And Esther said, "If it please the king, and if I have found favor in his sight, let it be sent to reverse the letters which were sent forth by Haman, even those that were written to destroy the Jews who are in thy kingdom. For how can I endure to see the calamity of my people? and how can I be saved..."
