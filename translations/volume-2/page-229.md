ΚΕΦ. ΚΑ΄. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Δ΄. 705
προνομὴν πᾶσι τοῖς ἐχθροῖς αὐτῶν, ἀνθ᾿ ὧν ἐποίησαν τὸ πονηρὸν 15
ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς μου, καὶ ἦσαν παροργίζοντές με ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέρας
ἧς ἐξήγαγον τοὺς πατέρας αὐτῶν ἐξ Αἰγύπτου, καὶ ἕως τῆς ἡμέ-
ρας ταύτης· καὶ γε αἷμα ἀθῶον ἐξέχεε Μανασσῆς πολὺ σφόδρα, 16
ἕως οὗ ἔπλησε τὴν Ἱερουσαλὴμ στόμα εἰς στόμα, πλὴν ἀπὸ τῶν
ἁμαρτιῶν αὐτοῦ ὧν ἐξήμαρτε τὸν Ἰούδαν, τοῦ ποιῆσαι τὸ πονηρὸν
ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς Κυρίου. Καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Μανασσῆ, καὶ 17
πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησε, καὶ ἡ ἁμαρτία αὐτοῦ ἣν ἥμαρτεν, οὐχὶ ταῦτα
γεγραμμένα ἐπὶ βιβλίῳ λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν Ἰούδα;
Καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Μανασσῆς μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐτάφη 18
ἐν κήπῳ τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ, ἐν κήπῳ Ὀζά. Καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Ἀμ-
μὼν υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ. Υἱὸς εἴκοσι καὶ δύο ἐτῶν Ἀμμὼν 19
ἐν τῷ βασιλεύειν αὐτόν, καὶ δύο ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ,
καὶ ὄνομα τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ Μασσαλαμειθ, θυγάτηρ Ἀροῦς ἐξ Ἰε-
τειβά. Καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ πονηρὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς Κυρίου, καθὼς ἐποίη- 20
σε Μανασσῆς ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἐν πάσῃ ὁδῷ ᾗ ἐπο- 21
ρεύθη ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐλάτρευσε τοῖς εἰδώλοις οἷς ἐλάτρευσεν
ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ, καὶ προσεκύνησεν αὐτοῖς· καὶ ἐγκατέλιπε τὸν Κύ- 22
ριον Θεὸν τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἐπορεύθη ἐν ὁδῷ Κυρίου.
Καὶ συνεστάφησαν οἱ παῖδες Ἀμμὼν πρὸς αὐτόν, καὶ ἐθανάτω- 23
σαν τὸν βασιλέα ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐπάταξε πᾶς ὁ λαὸς τῆς 24
γῆς πάντας τοὺς συστραφέντας ἐπὶ τὸν βασιλέα Ἀμμών, καὶ ἐβα-
σίλευσεν ὁ λαὸς τῆς γῆς τὸν Ἰωσίαν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ 25
τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Ἀμμών, ὅσα ἐποίησεν, οὐκ ἰδοῦ ταῦτα γε-
γραμμένα ἐπὶ βιβλίῳ λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν Ἰούδα;
Καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν ἐν τῷ τάφῳ αὐτοῦ ἐν κήπῳ Ὀζά, καὶ ἐβασίλευ- 26
σεν Ἰωσίας υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΒ΄. XXII.

Υἱὸς ὀκτὼ ἐτῶν Ἰωσίας ἐν τῷ βασιλεύειν αὐτόν, καὶ τριά- 1
κοντα καὶ ἓν ἔτος ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ὄνομα τῇ μη-
τρὶ αὐτοῦ Ἰεδιδά, θυγάτηρ Ἑδειὰ ἐκ Βασουρώθ. Καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ 2
εὐθὲς ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς Κυρίου, καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἐν πάσῃ ὁδῷ Δαυΐδ τοῦ
πατρὸς αὐτοῦ, οὐκ ἀπέστη δεξιὰ ἢ ἀριστερά. Καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐν τῷ 3
ὀκτωκαιδεκάτῳ ἔτει τῷ βασιλεῖ Ἰωσία, ἐν τῷ μηνὶ τῷ ἑβδόμῳ
ἐξαπέστειλεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τὸν Σαφφάν, υἱὸν Ἑσσελίου υἱοῦ Μεσ-

## Literary Translation:

### 2 Kings 21

**15** [for] a spoil unto all their enemies, because of that which they had done wickedly in My sight, and had provoked Me to wrath, from the day that I brought forth their fathers out of Egypt, even until this day.
**16** Moreover, Manasseh shed innocent blood exceeding much, until he had filled Jerusalem mouth to mouth; besides his sins, wherewith he made Judah to sin, in doing evil in the sight of the Lord.
**17** Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin which he committed, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
**18** And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza. And Amon his son reigned in his stead.
**19** Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.
**20** And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, as Manasseh his father had done.
**21** And he walked in all the way that his father had walked, and served the idols which his father had served, and worshipped them.
**22** And he forsook the Lord God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the Lord.
**23** And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the king in his own house.
**24** And the people of the land smote all them that had conspired against King Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.
**25** Now the rest of the acts of Amon, which he did, behold, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
**26** And they buried him in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza; and Josiah his son reigned in his stead.

### 2 Kings 22

**1** Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath.
**2** And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, and walked in all the way of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.
**3** And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, in the seventh month, that the king sent Shaphan, the son of Azaliah, the son of Mes[hullam]—
