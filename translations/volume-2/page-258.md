**9** υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ πεπτωκότας ἐν τῷ ὄρει Γελβουέ. Καὶ ἐξέδυσαν αὐτὸν, καὶ ἔλαβον τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀπέστειλαν εἰς γῆν ἀλλοφύλων κύκλῳ τοῦ εὐαγγελίσασθαι τοῖς εἰδώλοις αὐτῶν, καὶ τῷ λαῷ. **10** Καὶ ἔθηκαν τὰ σκεύη αὐτῶν ἐν οἴκῳ θεοῦ αὐτῶν· καὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ ἔθηκαν ἐν οἴκῳ Δαγών. **11** Καὶ ἤκουσαν πάντες οἱ κατοικοῦντες Γαλαὰδ πάντα ἃ ἐποίησαν ἀλλόφυλοι τῷ Σαοὺλ ἐν τῷ Ἰσραήλ. **12** Καὶ ἠγέρθησαν ἐκ Γαλαὰδ πᾶς ἀνὴρ δυνατὸς, καὶ ἔλαβον τὸ σῶμα Σαοὺλ, καὶ τὰ σώματα τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἤνεγκαν αὐτὰ εἰς Γαβεῖς, καὶ ἔθαψαν τὰ ὀστᾶ **13** αὐτῶν ὑπὸ τὴν δρῦν ἐν Γαβεῖς· καὶ ἐνήστευσαν ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας. Καὶ ἀπέθανε Σαοὺλ ἐν ταῖς ἀνομίαις αὐτοῦ, αἷς ἠνόμησε τῷ Κυρίῳ κατὰ τὸν λόγον Κυρίου, διότι οὐκ ἐφύλαξεν, ὅτι ἐπηρώτησε Σαοὺλ ἐν τῷ ἐγγαστριμύθῳ τοῦ ζητῆσαι, καὶ ἀπεκρίνατο αὐτῷ Σαμουὴλ **14** ὁ προφήτης, καὶ οὐκ ἐξεζήτησε τὸν Κύριον Σαούλ· καὶ ἀπέκτεινεν αὐτὸν, καθότι οὐκ ἠρώτησεν ἐν Κυρίῳ, καὶ ἐπέστρεψε τὴν βασιλείαν τῷ Δαυὶδ υἱῷ Ἰεσσαί.

**ΚΕΦ. ΙΑ΄. ΧΙ.**

**1** ΚΑΙ ἦλθε πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς Δαυὶδ ἐν Χεβρὼν, λέγοντες· ἰδοὺ **2** ὀστᾶ σου καὶ σάρκες σου ἡμεῖς. Καὶ ἐχθὲς καὶ τρίτην ὄντος Σαοὺλ βασιλέως, σὺ ἦσθα ὁ ἐξάγων καὶ εἰσάγων τὸν Ἰσραήλ· καὶ εἶπε Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου σοι· Σὺ ποιμανεῖς τὸν λαόν μου τὸν Ἰσραὴλ, **3** καὶ σὺ ἔσῃ εἰς ἡγούμενον ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἦλθον πάντες πρεσβύτεροι Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα ἐν Χεβρὼν. Καὶ διέθετο αὐτοῖς ὁ βασιλεὺς Δαυὶδ διαθήκην ἐν Χεβρὼν ἔναντι Κυρίου· καὶ ἔχρισαν τὸν Δαυὶδ εἰς βασιλέα ἐπὶ Ἰσραὴλ κατὰ τὸν λόγον Κυρίου διὰ χειρὸς Σαμουήλ. **4** Καὶ ἐπορεύθη ὁ βασιλεὺς, καὶ ἄνδρες Ἰσραὴλ ἐπὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ, αὕτη Ἰεβοὺς, καὶ ἐκεῖ οἱ Ἰεβουσαῖοι οἱ κατοικοῦντες τὴν γῆν. **5** Εἶπαν δὲ οἱ κατοικοῦντες Ἰεβοὺς τῷ Δαυὶδ, οὐκ εἰσελεύσῃ ὧδε. Καὶ προκατελάβετο τὴν περιοχὴν Σιὼν· αὕτη ἡ **6** πόλις Δαυίδ. Καὶ εἶπε Δαυίδ· πᾶς τύπτων Ἰεβουσαῖον ἐν πρώτοις, καὶ ἔσται εἰς ἄρχοντα, καὶ εἰς στρατηγόν· καὶ ἀνέβη ἐπ᾿ αὐτὴν ἐν πρώτοις Ἰωὰβ υἱὸς Σαρουίας, καὶ ἐγένετο εἰς ἄρχοντα. **7** Καὶ ἐκάθισε Δαυὶδ ἐν τῇ περιοχῇ· διὰ τοῦτο ἐκάλεσεν αὐτὴν, πόλιν Δαυίδ. **8** Καὶ ᾠκοδόμησε τὴν πόλιν κύκλῳ. Καὶ ἐπολέμησε, καὶ ἔλαβε τὴν πόλιν.

### CHAPTER 10.

**9** his sons, fallen upon Mount Gelboue. And they stripped him, and took his head, and his armour; and sent [them] into the land of the Philistines round about, to bear tidings to their idols, and to the people.
**10** And they put his armour in the house of their gods; and his head they set in the house of Dagon.
**11** And all they that dwelt in Galaad heard all that the Philistines had done unto Saul in Israel.
**12** Then all the valiant men arose from Galaad, and took the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons; and they brought them to Gabeis, and buried their bones
**13** beneath the oak in Gabeis; and they fasted for seven days. Thus Saul died for his transgressions, which he committed against the Lord, [even] against the word of the Lord, which he kept not; because he consulted with the spiritist, seeking [guidance], **14** and Samuel the prophet answered him, yet Saul sought not the Lord. Therefore He slew him, because he inquired not of the Lord, and turned the kingdom unto David, the son of Jesse.

### CHAPTER 11.

**1** And all Israel came unto David to Chebron, saying, "Behold,
**2** we are thy bone and thy flesh. Moreover, even yesterday and the third day, when Saul was king, thou wast he that did lead out and bring in Israel; and the Lord thy God said unto thee, 'Thou shalt shepherd My people Israel,
**3** and thou shalt be a leader over Israel.'" So all the elders of Israel came to the king in Chebron; and King David made a covenant with them in Chebron before the Lord. And they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the Lord by the hand of Samuel.
**4** And the king and all the men of Israel went to Hierousalem (this is Jebous); and there were the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land.
**5** But the inhabitants of Jebous said unto David, "Thou shalt not come hither." Nevertheless, David took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the City of David.
**6** And David said, "Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first, he shall be chief and commander." So Joab the son of Sarouia went up first upon it, and he became chief.
**7** And David dwelt in the stronghold; therefore they called it the City of David.
**8** And he built the city round about. And he fought, and took the city.
