ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Δʹ. ΚΕΦ. Θʹ.
17 βασιλεὺς Ἰούδα κατέβη ἰδεῖν τὸν Ἰωράμ. Καὶ ὁ σκοπὸς ἀνέβη ἐπὶ
τὸν πύργον ἐν Ἰεζράελ, καὶ εἶδε τὸν κονιορτὸν Ἰηοῦ ἐν τῷ αὐ-
τὸν παραγίνεσθαι, καὶ εἶπε· κονιορτὸν ἐγὼ βλέπω. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰω-
ράμ· λάβε ἐπιβάτην, καὶ ἀπόστειλον ἔμπροσθεν αὐτῶν, καὶ εἰπάτω·
18 ἡ εἰρήνη; Καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἐπιβάτης ἵππου εἰς ἀπάντησιν αὐτῷ, καὶ
εἶπε· τάδε λέγει ὁ βασιλεύς· ἡ εἰρήνη; καὶ εἶπεν Ἰηοῦ· τί σοι
καὶ εἰρήνη; ἐπίστρεφε πρὸς τὸ ὀπίσω μου. καὶ ἀπήγγειλεν ὁ σκο-
πός, λέγων· ἦλθεν ὁ ἄγγελος ἕως αὐτῶν, καὶ οὐκ ἀνέστρεψεν.
19 Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ἐπιβάτην ἵππου δεύτερον, καὶ ἦλθε πρὸς αὐτόν,
καὶ εἶπε· τάδε λέγει ὁ βασιλεύς· ἡ εἰρήνη; καὶ εἶπεν Ἰηοῦ· τί
20 σοι καὶ εἰρήνη; ἐπίστρεφε εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω μου. Καὶ ἀπήγγειλεν ὁ
σκοπός, λέγων· ἦλθεν ἕως αὐτῶν, καὶ οὐκ ἀνέστρεψεν, καὶ ὁ ἄγων
21 ἦγεν τὸν Ἰηοῦ υἱὸν Ναμεσσί, ὅτι ἐν παραλλαγῇ ἐγένετο. Καὶ
εἶπεν Ἰωράμ· ζεῦξον. καὶ ἔζευξαν ἅρμα· καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Ἰωρὰμ βα-
σιλεὺς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ Ὀχοζίας βασιλεὺς Ἰούδα, ἀνὴρ ἐν τῷ ἅρματι
αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐξῆλθον εἰς ἀπάντησιν Ἰηοῦ, καὶ εὗρον αὐτὸν ἐν τῇ
22 μερίδι Ναβουθαὶ τοῦ Ἰεζραηλίτου. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς εἶδεν Ἰωράμ
τὸν Ἰηοῦ, καὶ εἶπεν· ἡ εἰρήνη, Ἰηοῦ; καὶ εἶπεν Ἰηοῦ· τί εἰρήνη;
ἔτι αἱ πορνεῖαι Ἰεζάβελ τῆς μητρός σου, καὶ τὰ φάρμακα αὐτῆς
23 τὰ πολλά. Καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν Ἰωρὰμ τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔφυγε·
24 καὶ εἶπε πρὸς Ὀχοζεί· δόλος Ὀχοζεί. Καὶ ἐπλήσεν Ἰηοῦ τὴν
χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ τόξῳ, καὶ ἐπάταξε τὸν Ἰωρὰμ ἀναμέσον τῶν
βραχιόνων αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐξῆλθε τὸ βέλος αὐτοῦ διὰ τῆς καρδίας αὐ-
25 τοῦ· καὶ ἔκαμψεν ἐπὶ τὰ γόνατα αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς Βαδεκὰρ
τὸν τριστάτην αὐτοῦ· ῥῖψαι αὐτὸν ἐν τῇ μερίδι τοῦ ἀγροῦ Ναβου-
θαὶ τοῦ Ἰεζραηλίτου, ὅτι μνημονεύω, ἐγὼ καὶ σὺ ἐπιβεβηκότες
ἐπὶ ζεύγη ὀπίσω Ἀχαάβ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ Κύριος ἔλαβεν ἐπ᾿
26 αὐτὸν τὸ λῆμμα τοῦτο. Εἰ μὴ τὰ αἵματα Ναβουθαὶ, καὶ τὰ αἵ-
ματα τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ εἶδον ἐχθές, φησί Κύριος, καὶ ἀνταποδώσω
αὐτῷ ἐν τῇ μερίδι ταύτῃ, φησί Κύριος. Καὶ νῦν ἄρας δὴ ῥῖψον
27 αὐτὸν ἐν τῇ μερίδι, κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα Κυρίου. Καὶ Ὀχοζίας βασι-
λεὺς Ἰούδα εἶδε, καὶ ἔφυγεν ὁδὸν Βαιθγάν. Καὶ ἐδίωξεν ὀπίσω
αὐτοῦ Ἰηοῦ, καὶ εἶπε, καί γε αὐτόν. καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτὸν ἐν τῷ
ἅρματι πρὸς τὸ ἀναβαίνειν Γαῒ, ἢ ἐστιν Ἰεβλαάμ· καὶ ἔφυγεν εἰς
28 Μαγεδδὼ, καὶ ἀπέθανεν ἐκεῖ. Καὶ ἐνεβίβασαν αὐτὸν οἱ παῖδες αὐ-
τοῦ εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν ἐν τῷ τάφῳ αὐτοῦ, μετὰ

**17** King Ahaziah of Judah came down to see Joram. And the watchman went up to the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the dust of Jehu as he drew near, and he said, "I see dust." Then Joram said, "Take a horseman, and send [him] forth before them, and let him say:
**18** 'Is it peace?' " And there went forth a horseman to meet him, and he said, "Thus saith the king: 'Is it peace?' " And Jehu said, "What hast thou to do with peace? Turn thee behind me." And the watchman reported, saying, "The messenger came even unto them, and he hath not returned."
**19** And he sent out a second horseman, and he came to him, and said, "Thus saith the king: 'Is it peace?' " And Jehu said, "What hast thou to do with peace? Turn thee behind me."
**20** And the watchman reported, saying, "He came even unto them, and he hath not returned; and the manner of his driving was like the driving of Jehu the son of Namessi; for his driving was furious."
**21** Then Joram said, "Harness [the chariot]." And they harnessed his chariot. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went forth, each in his chariot, and they went out to meet Jehu; and they found him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.
**22** And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, he said, "Is it peace, Jehu?" And Jehu answered, "What peace [can there be], whilst the harlotries of Jezebel thy mother and her many sorceries yet remain?"
**23** And Joram turned his hands [to flee], and fled.
**24** And [Jehu] said unto Ahaziah, "Treachery, Ahaziah!" And Jehu filled his hand with his bow, and smote Joram between his arms, and the arrow went out through his heart; and he sank down upon his knees.
**25** Then said Jehu to Badekar his chief aide, "Cast him into the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for I remember, when I and thou rode together upon chariots behind Ahab his father, how that the LORD took this burden upon him.
**26** 'Surely I have seen the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons yesterday,' saith the LORD; 'and I will repay him in this portion,' saith the LORD. Now therefore, take [him] up, and cast him into the portion, according to the word of the LORD."
**27** But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw [this], he fled by the way of Bethgan. And Jehu pursued after him, and said, "And him also!" And he smote him in his chariot upon the ascent to Gai, which is Ieblaam; and he fled to Megiddo, and died there.
**28** And his servants carried him up to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre with
