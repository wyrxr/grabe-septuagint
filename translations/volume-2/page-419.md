**Ι Ω Β. 895**

**19** μικρὸς καὶ μέγας ἐκεῖ ἐστι, καὶ θεράπων οὐ δεδοικὼς τὸν Κύριον αὐτοῦ.
**20** Ἵνατί γὰρ δέδοται τοῖς ἐν πικρίᾳ (ψυχῆς) φῶς, ζωὴ δὲ ταῖς ἐν ὀδύναις ψυχαῖς;
**21** Οἳ ἱμείρονται θανάτου, καὶ οὐ τυγχάνουσιν,
**22** ἀνορύσσοντες αὐτὸν ὥσπερ θησαυρόν· περιχαρείς δὲ ἐγένοντο, ἐὰν κατατύχωσι (θανάτου).
**23** Θάνατος γὰρ ἀνδρὶ ἀνάπαυσις, οὗ ἡ ὁδὸς ἀπεκρύφθη· συνέκλεισε γὰρ ὁ Θεὸς κατ᾿ αὐτοῦ.
**24** Πρὸ γὰρ τῶν σίτων μου στεναγμός μου ἥκει, δακρύω δὲ ἐγὼ συνεχομένος φόβῳ·
**25** φόβος γὰρ ὃν εὐλαβούμην, ἦλθέ μοι, καὶ ὃν ἐδεδοίκειν, συνήντησέ μοι.
**26** Οὔτε εἰρήνευσα, οὔτε ἡσύχασα, οὔτε ἀνεπαυσάμην· ἦλθε δὲ μοι ὀργή.

**ΚΕΦ. Δ΄. IV.**

**1-2** Ὑπολαβὼν δὲ Ἐλιφάζ ὁ Θαιμανίτης, λέγει· μὴ πολλάκις σοι λελάληται ἐν κόπῳ; ἰσχὺν δὲ ῥημάτων σου τίς ὑποίσει;
**3** Εἰ γὰρ σὺ ἐνουθέτησας πολλούς, καὶ χεῖρας ἀσθενούντων παρεκάλεσας,
**4** ἀσθενοῦντας δὲ ἐξανέστησας ῥήμασι, γόνασι δὲ ἀδυνατοῦσι περιέθηκας θάρσος·
**5** νυνὶ δὲ ἥκει ἐπὶ σὲ πόνος, καὶ ἥφατό σου, σὺ δὲ ἐσπούδακας.
**6** Πότερον οὐχὶ ὁ φόβος σου ἐστιν ἐν ἀφροσύνῃ, καὶ ἡ ἐλπίς σου, καὶ ἡ ἀκακία τῆς ὁδοῦ σου;
**7** Μνήσθητι οὖν, τίς καθαρὸς ὢν ἀπώλετο; ἢ πότε ἀληθινοὶ ὁλόριζοι ἀπώλοντο;
**8** Καθ᾽ ὃν τρόπον ἴδον τοὺς ἀροτριῶντας τὰ ἄτοπα· οἱ δὲ σπείροντες αὐτά, ὀδύνας θεριοῦσιν ἑαυτοῖς·
**9** ἀπὸ προστάγματος Κυρίου ἀπολοῦνται, ἀπὸ δὲ πνεύματος ὀργῆς αὐτοῦ ἀφανισθήσονται.
**10** Στόνος λέοντος, φωνὴ δὲ λεαίνης, γαυρίαμα δὲ δρακόντων ἐσβέσθη·
**11** μυρμηκολέων ὤλετο παρὰ τὸ μὴ ἔχειν βοράν· σκύμνοι δὲ λεόντων ἔλιπον ἀλλήλους.
**12** Εἰ δέ τι ῥῆμα ἀληθινὸν ἐγεγόνει ἐν λόγοις σου, οὐδὲν ἂν τούτων κακῶν συνήντησέ σοι.
**13** Πότερον οὖν οὐ δέξεται (σου) τὸ οὖς μου ἐξαίσια παρ᾽ αὐτοῦ; (ἐξαίσιοι γὰρ) φόβοι καὶ ἠχὼ νυκτερινή,
**14** ἐπιπίπτων φόβος ἐπ᾿ ἀνθρώπους, φρίκη (δέ) μοι συνήντησε καὶ τρόμος, καὶ μεγάλως μου τὰ ὀστᾶ συνέσεισε·
**15** καὶ πνεῦμα ἐπὶ πρόσωπόν μου ἐπῆλθεν, ἔφριξαν δέ μου τρίχες καὶ σάρκες.
**16** Καὶ ἀνέστην καὶ οὐκ ἐπέγνων. Ἴδον καὶ οὐκ ἦν μορφὴ πρὸ ὀφθαλμῶν μου· ἀλλ᾿ ἢ αὔραν καὶ φωνὴν ἤκουον·
**17** τί γάρ; μὴ καθαρὸς ἔσται βροτὸς ἔναντι Κυρίου; ἢ ἀπὸ τῶν ἔργων αὐτοῦ ἄμεμπτος ἀνήρ;
**18** Εἰ κατὰ παίδων αὐτοῦ οὐ πιστεύει, κατὰ δὲ ἀγγέλων αὐτοῦ σκολιόν τι ἐπενόησε·
**19** ἔα δὲ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας οἰκίας πηλίνας, ἐξ ὧν καὶ αὐτοί

## CHAPTER III.

19 There the small and great are alike, and the servant fears not his own master.

20 For wherefore is light bestowed upon the bitter in [spirit], or life unto those souls in anguish?

21 Who long for death, and obtain it not,

22 Digging for it as for hid treasure; yea, they rejoice exceedingly, if they but find it.

23 For death is rest unto a man whose way hath been concealed, for God hath shut him in against his will.

24 For before my food, my groaning cometh; and I weep, being seized by fear.

25 For the very fear I dreaded, that hath come upon me; and that which I did greatly fear, hath met me.

26 I knew neither peace, nor quietude, nor found I rest; but wrath hath come upon me.

## CHAPTER IV.

1-2 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said: "Hath it not oft been spoken unto thee in weariness? But who can bear the force of thy words?

3 For if thou hast admonished many, and strengthened the hands of the infirm,

4 And by thy words hast raised up those that stumbled, and unto the enfeebled knees hast imparted courage;

5 But now is anguish come upon thee, and it doth cleave unto thee, and thou art greatly troubled.

6 Is not thy reverence [for God] become folly, and thy hope, and the blamelessness of thy way?

7 Remember, I pray thee, who that was pure hath perished? Or when have the truly upright been utterly cut off?

8 According to what I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and they that sow the same, shall reap sorrows for themselves;

9 By the breath of the Lord's command shall they perish, and by the blast of His wrath shall they be consumed.

10 The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the lioness, and the proud boasting of the dragons, have been quenched.

11 The ant-lion hath perished for want of prey, and the lion's whelps have left one another.

12 Now if any true word had been in thy discourse, none of these evils would have befallen thee.

13 Will not mine ear then receive extraordinary tidings (concerning thee) from Him? (For indeed, they are extraordinary.) Fears, and a night vision,

14 A fear that falleth upon men. And dread (indeed) met me, and trembling, and greatly did it shake my bones;

15 And a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood upright.

16 And I stood, yet discerned it not. I saw, but no form was before mine eyes; only a whisper and a voice did I hear:

17 "What then? Shall mortal man be pure before God? Or a man be blameless by his works?

18 If in His children He doth place no trust, and in His angels He hath perceived some blemish;

19 How much more them that dwell in houses of clay, of which even they themselves..."
