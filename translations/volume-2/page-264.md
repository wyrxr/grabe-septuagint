3 αὐτοῦ διὰ τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἔλαβε Δαυὶδ ἔτι γυναῖκας ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ· καὶ ἐτέχθησαν Δαυὶδ ἔτι υἱοὶ καὶ θυγατέρες.
4 Καὶ ταῦτα τὰ ὀνόματα αὐτῶν τῶν τεχθέντων, οἳ ἦσαν αὐτῷ ἐν
5 Ἱερουσαλήμ· Σαμμαοὺ, καὶ Σωβάβ, Νάθαν, καὶ Σαλωμών, καὶ
6 Ἰεβαὰρ, καὶ Ἐλισαῦ, καὶ Ἐλιφαλέτ, καὶ Ναγὲθ, καὶ Ναφὰγ, καὶ
7 Ἰαφιὲ, καὶ Ἐλισαμὰ, καὶ Βαλλιαδὰ, καὶ Ἐλιφαλέτ.
8 Καὶ ἤκουσαν ἀλλόφυλοι ὅτι ἐχρίσθη Δαυὶδ βασιλεὺς ἐπὶ πάντα Ἰσραήλ· καὶ ἀνέβησαν πάντες οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι ζητῆσαι τὸν Δαυίδ.
9 Καὶ ἐξῆλθε Δαυὶδ, ὡς ἤκουσεν, εἰς ὑπάντησιν αὐτοῖς.
10 Καὶ ἀλλόφυλοι ἦλθον, καὶ συνέπεσαν ἐν τῇ κοιλάδι τῶν γιγάντων. Καὶ ἐπηρώτησε Δαυὶδ διὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ, λέγων· εἰ ἀναβῶ ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀλλοφύλους, καὶ δώσεις αὐτοὺς εἰς τὰς χεῖράς μου; Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Κύριος· ἀνάβηθι, καὶ δώσω αὐτοὺς εἰς τὰς χεῖράς σου.
11 Καὶ ἀνέβη εἰς Βαὰλ Φαρασεὶν, καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτοὺς ἐκεῖ Δαυίδ. Καὶ εἶπε Δαυίδ· διέκοψεν ὁ Θεὸς τοὺς ἐχθροὺς μου ἐν χειρὶ μου, ὡς διακοπὴν ὕδατος. διὰ
12 τοῦτο ἐκάλεσε τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ τόπου ἐκείνου, Διακοπὴ Φαρασείν. Καὶ ἐγκατέλιπον ἐκεῖ τοὺς θεοὺς αὐτῶν. Καὶ εἶπε Δαυὶδ κατακαῦσαι αὐτοὺς ἐν πυρί.
13 Καὶ προσέθεντο ἔτι ἀλλόφυλοι, καὶ συνέπεσαν ἔτι ἐν τῇ κοιλάδι τῶν γιγάντων.
14 Καὶ ἠρώτησε Δαυὶδ ἔτι ἐν Θεῷ. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ Θεός· οὐ πορεύσῃ ὀπίσω αὐτῶν· ἀποστρέφου ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν, καὶ παρέσῃ αὐτοῖς πλησίον τῶν ἀπίων.
15 Καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῷ ἀκοῦσαί σε τὴν φωνὴν τοῦ συσσεισμοῦ τῶν ἄκρων τῶν ἀπίων, τότε ἐξελεύσῃ εἰς τὸν πόλεμον, ὅτι ἐξῆλθεν ὁ Θεὸς ἔμπροσθεν σου τοῦ πατάξαι τὴν παρεμβολὴν τῶν ἀλλοφύλων.
16 Καὶ ἐποίησε καθὼς ἐνετείλατο αὐτῷ ὁ Θεός· καὶ ἐπάταξε τὴν παρεμβολὴν τῶν ἀλλοφύλων ἀπὸ Γαβαὼν ἕως Γαζηρά.
17 Καὶ ἐγένετο τὸ ὄνομα Δαυὶδ ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ, καὶ Κύριος ἔδωκε τὸν φόβον αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΕʹ. XV.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐποίησεν αὐτῷ οἰκίας ἐν πόλει Δαυὶδ, καὶ ἡτοίμασε τὸν τόπον τῆς κιβωτοῦ τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ ἐποίησεν αὐτῇ σκηνήν.
2 Τότε εἶπε Δαυίδ· οὐκ ἔστιν ἆραι τὴν κιβωτὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ, ἀλλ᾿ ἢ τοὺς Λευίτας, ὅτι αὐτοὺς ἐξελέξατο Κύριος αἴρειν τὴν κιβωτὸν Κυρίου, καὶ λειτουργεῖν αὐτῇ ἕως αἰῶνος.
3 Καὶ συνήγαγε Δαυὶδ τὸν πάντα Ἰσραὴλ εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ τοῦ ἀνενεγκεῖν τὴν κιβωτὸν Κυρίου εἰς τὸν τόπον ὅν ἡτοίμασεν αὐτῇ.

**Chapter 14**

**3** His kingdom [was exalted] for His people Israel's sake. And David took yet more wives in Jerusalem; and there were born unto David yet more sons and daughters.
**4** And these are the names of them that were born, who were unto him in Jerusalem:
**5** Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,
**6** And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Eliphelet, and Nogah, and Nepheg,
**7** And Japhia, and Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphelet.
**8** And the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel; and all the Philistines went up to seek David.
**9** And David went out to meet them, when he heard thereof.
**10** And the Philistines came, and spread themselves in the Valley of Rephaim. And David enquired of God, saying, “Shall I go up against the Philistines? And wilt Thou deliver them into my hands?” And the Lord said unto him, “Go up, and I will deliver them into thy hands.”
**11** So he went up to Baal-Perazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, “God hath broken through mine enemies by my hand, as the breaking forth of waters.” Therefore,
**12** He called the name of that place Perez-Perazim. And they left their gods there; and David commanded that they should be burnt with fire.
**13** And the Philistines returned yet again, and spread themselves once more in the Valley of Rephaim.
**14** And David enquired again of God. And God said unto him, “Thou shalt not go up after them; turn away from them, and thou shalt come upon them nigh unto the pear trees.
**15** And it shall be, when thou shalt hear the sound of the rustling of the tops of the pear trees, then thou shalt go out to battle; for God is gone forth before thee to smite the camp of the Philistines.”
**16** And he did as God commanded him; and they smote the camp of the Philistines from Gibeon even unto Gezer.
**17** And the name of David went out into all the lands; and the Lord laid the fear of him upon all nations.

**Chapter 15**

**1** Moreover, David made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched a tent for it.
**2** Then David said, “It is not lawful for any to carry the ark of God save the Levites; for them hath the Lord chosen to bear the ark of the Lord, and to minister unto it forever.”
**3** And David gathered all Israel to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the Lord unto its place, which he had prepared for it.
