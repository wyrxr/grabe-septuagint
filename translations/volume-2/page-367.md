³¹ ἡμῖν, καὶ ἐῤῥύσατο ἡμᾶς ἀπὸ χειρὸς ἐχθροῦ καὶ πολεμίου ἐν τῇ
   ὁδῷ, καὶ ἤλθομεν εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἐκαθίσαμεν ἐκεῖ ἡμέρας
³² τρεῖς. Καὶ ἐγενήθη τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τετάρτῃ ἐστήσαμεν τὸ ἀργύριον
   καὶ τὸ χρυσίον καὶ τὰ σκεύη ἐν οἴκῳ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν ἐπὶ χεῖρα Μαρμὼθ
   υἱοῦ Οὐρία τοῦ ἱερέως, καὶ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ Ἐλεάζαρ υἱὸς Φινεές, καὶ
   μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ Ἰωζαβὰδ υἱὸς Ἰησοῦ, καὶ Νωαδία υἱὸς Βαναία οἱ Λευῖται,
³³ ἐν ἀριθμῷ καὶ ἐν σταθμῷ τὰ πάντα, καὶ ἐγράφη πᾶς ὁ σταθμός.
³⁴ Ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ, οἱ ἐλθόντες ἀπὸ τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας υἱοὶ
   τῆς παροικίας προσήνεγκαν ὁλοκαυτώσεις τῷ Θεῷ Ἰσραήλ, μόσχους δώδεκα περὶ παντὸς Ἰσραήλ, κριοὺς ἐνενηκονταέξ, ἀμνοὺς
   ἑβδομηκονταεπτά, χιμάρους περὶ ἁμαρτίας δώδεκα, τὰ πάντα ὁλοκαυτώματα τῷ Κυρίῳ.
³⁵ Καὶ ἔδωκαν τὸ νόμισμα τοῦ βασιλέως
   τοῖς διοικηταῖς τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ ἐπάρχοις πέραν τοῦ ποταμοῦ·
   καὶ ἐδόξασαν τὸν λαὸν καὶ τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Θεοῦ.

**ΚΕΦ. Θʹ.**

¹ ΚΑΙ ὡς ἐτελέσθη ταῦτα, ἤγγισαν πρὸς με οἱ ἄρχοντες, λέγοντες· οὐκ ἐχωρίσθη ὁ λαὸς Ἰσραὴλ καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς καὶ οἱ Λευῖται ἀπὸ λαῶν τῶν γαιῶν ἐν μακρύμασιν αὐτῶν, τῷ Χανανὶ ὁ
   Ἔθδι, ὁ Φερεζί, ὁ Ἰεβουσί, ὁ Ἀμμωνί, ὁ Μωαβί, ὁ Μωφρί, καὶ
   ὁ Ἀμορί,
² ὅτι ἐλάβοσαν ἀπὸ θυγατέρων αὐτῶν ἑαυτοῖς καὶ τοῖς
   υἱοῖς ἑαυτῶν· καὶ παρήχθη σπέρμα τὸ ἅγιον ἐν λαοῖς τῶν γαιῶν,
   καὶ χεὶρ τῶν ἀρχόντων ἐν τῇ ἀσυνθεσίᾳ ταύτῃ ἐν ἀρχῇ.
³ Καὶ ὡς
   ἤκουσα τὸν λόγον τοῦτον, διέῤῥηξα τὰ ἱμάτιά μου, καὶ ἐπαλλόμην, καὶ ἔτιλλον ἀπὸ τῶν τριχῶν τῆς κεφαλῆς μου καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ
   πώγωνός μου, καὶ ἐκαθήμην ἠρεμάζων.
⁴ Καὶ συνήχθησαν πρὸς με
   πᾶς ὁ διώκων λόγον Θεοῦ Ἰσραὴλ ἐπὶ ἀσυνθεσίᾳ τῆς ἀποικεσίας·
   κἀγὼ καθήμενος ἠρεμάζων ἕως τῆς θυσίας τῆς ἑσπερινῆς.
⁵ Καὶ ἐν
   θυσίᾳ τῇ ἑσπερινῇ ἀνέστην ἀπὸ τῆς ταπεινώσεώς μου· καὶ ἐν τῷ
   διαῤῥῆξαί με τὰ ἱμάτιά μου, καὶ ἐπαλλόμην, καὶ κλίνω ἐπὶ τὰ γόνατά μου, καὶ ἐκπετάζω τὰς χεῖράς μου πρὸς Κύριον τὸν Θεόν,
⁶ καὶ εἶπα· Κύριε ἠσχύνθην καὶ ἐνετράπην τοῦ ὑψῶσαι, Θεέ μου,
   τὸ πρόσωπόν μου πρὸς σὲ, ὅτι αἱ ἀνομίαι ἡμῶν ἐπληθύνθησαν ὑπὲρ
   κεφαλῆς ἡμῶν, καὶ αἱ πλημμέλειαι ἡμῶν ἐμεγαλύνθησαν ἕως εἰς
   οὐρανόν.
⁷ Ἀπὸ ἡμερῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν ἐσμὲν ἐν πλημμελείᾳ μεγάλῃ ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης·

³¹ us; and He delivered us from the hand of the enemy and of the adversary in the way.
   And we came unto Jerusalem, and rested there three days.
³² And it came to pass on the fourth day, that we weighed out the silver and the gold
   and the vessels in the House of our God into the hand of Marmoth the son of Uria the priest;
   and with him [was] Eleazar the son of Phinehas, and with him Jozabad the son of Jeshua,
   and Noadiah the son of Banaiah, the Levites,
³³ by number and by weight were all things; and all the weight was recorded.
³⁴ At that time, the children of the captivity, who had come from the exile, offered
   burnt offerings unto the God of Israel: twelve bulls for all Israel,
   ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, twelve he-goats for a sin offering;
   all these were burnt offerings unto the Lord.
³⁵ And they delivered the king's command unto the king's governors and the prefects
   beyond the river; and they caused the people and the House of God to be honored.

¹ Now when these things were finished, the princes came near unto me, saying:
   "The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves
   from the peoples of the lands, [even] from their abominations:
   from the Canaanite, the Hethdi, the Perizzite, the Jebusite, the Ammonite,
   the Moabite, the Mophri, and the Amorite,
² for they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons;
   and the holy seed hath been mingled with the peoples of the lands,
   and the hand of the rulers hath been first in this trespass."
³ And when I heard this word, I rent my garments, and I trembled greatly,
   and I plucked from the hair of my head and from my beard, and I sat down desolate.
⁴ And there gathered unto me all who trembled at the word of the God of Israel,
   because of the trespass of the exiles; and I sat desolate until the evening sacrifice.
⁵ And at the evening sacrifice, I rose up from my humiliation;
   and while I did rend my garments, and was greatly moved,
   I bowed upon my knees and spread forth my hands unto the Lord my God,
⁶ and I said: "O my Lord, I am ashamed and confounded to lift up, O my God,
   my face unto Thee; for our iniquities are multiplied above our head,
   and our trespasses are grown great even unto the heavens.
⁷ From the days of our fathers have we been in great trespass unto this day;
