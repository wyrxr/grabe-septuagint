ΚΕΦ. ΚΒ´. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Γ´. 657
λησε Κύριος ἐν ἐμοί. Καὶ εἶπεν· ἀκούσατε, λαοὶ πάντες. Καὶ ἀ- 29
νέβη βασιλεὺς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ Ἰωσαφὰτ βασιλεὺς Ἰούδα μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ εἰς
Ῥεμμὰθ Γαλαάδ. Καὶ εἶπε βασιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς Ἰωσαφὰτ βα- 30
σιλέα Ἰούδα· συγκαλύψομαι, καὶ εἰσελεύσομαι εἰς τὸν πόλεμον,
καὶ σὺ ἔνδυσαι τὸν ἱματισμόν μου. καὶ συνεκάλυψατο ὁ βασιλεὺς
Ἰσραήλ, καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸν πόλεμον. Καὶ βασιλεὺς Συρίας ἐνε- 31
τείλατο τοῖς ἄρχουσι τῶν ἁρμάτων αὐτοῦ τριάκοντα καὶ δύο, λέ-
γων· μὴ πολεμεῖτε μικρὸν καὶ μέγαν, ἀλλ᾽ ἢ τὸν βασιλέα Ἰσραὴλ
μονώτατον. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς εἶδον οἱ ἄρχοντες τῶν ἁρμάτων τὸν 32
Ἰωσαφὰτ βασιλέα Ἰούδα, καὶ αὐτοὶ εἶπον· φαίνεται βασιλεὺς Ἰσ-
ραὴλ οὗτος· καὶ ἐκύκλωσαν αὐτὸν πολεμῆσαι· καὶ ἀνέκραξεν Ἰω-
σαφάτ. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς εἶδον οἱ ἄρχοντες τῶν ἁρμάτων, ὅτι οὐκ 33
ἔστι βασιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ οὗτος, καὶ ἀπέστρεψαν ἀπ᾽ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐπέ- 34
τεινεν εἰς τὸ τόξον εὐστόχως, καὶ ἐπάταξε τὸν βασιλέα Ἰσραὴλ
ἀναμέσον τοῦ πνεύμονος, καὶ ἀναμέσον τοῦ θώρακος· καὶ εἶπε τῷ
ἡνιόχῳ αὐτοῦ· ἐπίστρεφον τὴν χεῖρά σου, καὶ ἐξάγαγέ με ἐκ τοῦ
πολέμου, ὅτι τέτρωμαι. Καὶ ἐτροπώθη ὁ πόλεμος ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ 35
ἐκείνῃ, καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς ἦν ἑστηκὼς ἐπὶ τοῦ ἅρματος ἐξεναντίας Συ-
ρίας ἀπὸ πρωὶ ἕως ἑσπέρας, καὶ ἀπέχυνε τὸ αἷμα ἐκ τῆς πληγῆς
εἰς τὸν κόλπον τοῦ ἅρματος, καὶ ἀπέθανεν ἑσπέρας, καὶ ἐξεπο-
ρεύετο τὸ αἷμα ἐκ τῆς τροπῆς ἕως τοῦ κόλπου τοῦ ἅρματος. Καὶ 36
ἔστη ὁ στρατοκήρυξ ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ, δύνοντος τοῦ ἡλίου, λέγων·
Ἕκαστος εἰς τὴν ἑαυτοῦ πόλιν, καὶ ἕκαστος εἰς τὴν ἑαυτοῦ γῆν
ἀποτρεχέτω, ὅτι τέθνηκεν ὁ βασιλεύς· καὶ ἦλθεν εἰς Σαμάρειαν, 37
καὶ ἔθαψαν τὸν βασιλέα ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ. Καὶ ἀπένιψαν τὸ ἅρμα ἐπὶ 38
τὴν κρήνην Σαμαρείας, καὶ ἐξέλειξαν αἱ ὗες, καὶ οἱ κύνες τὸ αἷμα
αὐτοῦ, καὶ αἱ πόρναι ἐλούσαντο ἐν τῷ αἵματι, κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα Κυ-
ρίου ὃ ἐλάλησε. Καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Ἀχαάβ, καὶ πάντα ἃ 39
ἐποίησε, καὶ οἶκον ἐλεφάντινον ὃν ᾠκοδόμησε, καὶ πάσας τὰς πό-
λεις ἃς ἐποίησεν, οὐκ ἰδοὺ ταῦτα γέγραπται ἐν βιβλίῳ λόγων τῶν
ἡμερῶν τῶν βασιλέων Ἰσραήλ; Καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Ἀχαὰβ μετὰ τῶν 40
πατέρων αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Ὀχοζίας υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀντ᾽ αὐτοῦ.
Καὶ Ἰωσαφὰτ υἱὸς Ἀσὰ ἐβασίλευσεν ἐπὶ Ἰούδαν ἐν ἔτει τετάρτῳ 41
τοῦ Ἀχαὰβ βασιλέως Ἰσραήλ (ἐβασίλευσεν). Ἰωσαφὰτ υἱὸς τριά- 42
κοντα καὶ πέντε ἐτῶν ἐν τῷ βασιλεύειν αὐτόν· καὶ εἴκοσι καὶ πέν-
τε ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ὄνομα τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ Ἀ-

**Chapter 22**
**(continued)**

...the Lord hath not spoken by me."
And he said, "Hearken, O all ye people!"

**29** So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, went up with him unto Ramoth-Gilead.
**30** And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, "I will disguise myself, and so enter into the battle; but do thou put on my apparel." Thus the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.
**31** Now the king of Syria had commanded his thirty and two chariot captains, saying, "Fight ye neither with small nor with great, but only with the king of Israel, even him alone."
**32** And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, they themselves said, "This appeareth to be the king of Israel." And they encircled him to fight; but Jehoshaphat cried out.
**33** And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from him.
**34** And a certain man drew his bow skillfully, and smote the king of Israel between the lung and between the breastplate; and he said unto his charioteer, "Turn thy hand, and carry me forth from the battle, for I am wounded."
**35** And the battle was turned in that day, and the king was standing in his chariot against Syria from morning until evening; and the blood poured forth from the wound into the bosom of the chariot. And he died in the evening, and the blood issued forth from the turning of the wound unto the bosom of the chariot.
**36** And the herald stood in the camp at the setting of the sun, saying, "Let every man depart unto his own city, and every man unto his own land, for the king is dead!"
**37** And he came unto Samaria, and they buried the king in Samaria.
**38** And they washed the chariot by the spring of Samaria, and the swine and the dogs licked up his blood, and the harlots bathed themselves in the blood, according to the word of the Lord which He had spoken.
**39** Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and all the cities which he made, are not these things written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel?
**40** So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.
**41** And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab, king of Israel (he reigned).
**42** Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And the name of his mother was A[zubah].
