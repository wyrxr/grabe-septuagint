**Original Greek Text (with light OCR corrections):**

**23** μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ. Ἐν ἔτει πεντεκαιδεκάτῳ τοῦ Ἀμεσσίου, υἱοῦ Ἰωὰς, βασιλέως Ἰούδα, ἐβασίλευσεν Ἱεροβοὰμ υἱὸς Ἰωὰς βασιλέως Ἰσραὴλ ἐπὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ τεσσαράκοντα καὶ ἓν ἔτος.
**24** Καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ πονηρὸν ἐνώπιον Κυρίου· οὐκ ἀπέστη ἀπὸ πασῶν ἁμαρτιῶν Ἱεροβοὰμ υἱοῦ Ναβὰτ, ὃς ἐξήμαρτε τὸν Ἰσραήλ.
**25** Αὐτὸς ἀπέστησε τὸ ὅριον Ἰσραὴλ ἀπὸ εἰσόδου Αἰμὰθ ἕως τῆς θαλάσσης τῆς Ἄραβα κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα Κυρίου Θεοῦ Ἰσραὴλ, ὃς ἐλάλησεν ἐν χειρὶ δούλου αὐτοῦ Ἰωνᾶ, υἱοῦ Ἀμαθὶ, τοῦ προφήτου τοῦ ἐκ Γεθαχοβέρ.
**26** Ὅτι εἶδε Κύριος τὴν ταπείνωσιν Ἰσραὴλ πικρὰν σφόδρα, καὶ ὀλιγοστοὺς συνεχομένους, καὶ ἐσπανισμένους, καὶ ἐγκαταλελειμμένους, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ βοηθῶν τῷ Ἰσραήλ.
**27** Καὶ οὐκ ἐλάλησε Κύριος ἐξαλείψαι τὸ σπέρμα Ἰσραὴλ ὑποκάτωθεν τοῦ οὐρανοῦ· καὶ ἔσωσεν αὐτοὺς διὰ χειρὸς Ἱεροβοὰμ υἱοῦ Ἰωὰς.
**28** Καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Ἱεροβοὰμ, καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησε, καὶ αἱ δυναστεῖαι αὐτοῦ, ὅσα ἐπολέμησε, καὶ ὅσα ἀπέστρεψε τὴν Δαμασκὸν, καὶ τὴν Αἰμὰθ τῷ Ἰούδα ἐν Ἰσραὴλ, οὐχὶ ταῦτα γεγραμμένα ἐπὶ βιβλίῳ λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν Ἰσραήλ;
**29** Καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Ἱεροβοὰμ μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ, μετὰ βασιλέων Ἰσραήλ· καὶ ἐβασίλευσε Ζαχαρίας υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀντὶ (τοῦ πατρὸς) αὐτοῦ.

### 2 Kings 15

**1** ΕΝ ἔτει εἰκοστῷ καὶ ἑβδόμῳ ἔτει τῷ Ἱεροβοὰμ βασιλεῖ Ἰσραὴλ ἐβασίλευσεν Ἀζαρίας, υἱὸς Ἀμεσσίου βασιλέως Ἰούδα.
**2** Υἱὸς ἑκκαίδεκα ἐτῶν ἦν ἐν τῷ βασιλεύειν αὐτὸν, καὶ πεντήκοντα καὶ δύο ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ, καὶ ὄνομα μητρὶ αὐτοῦ Ἰεχελία ἐξ Ἱερουσαλήμ.
**3** Καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ ἀγαθὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς Κυρίου, κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν Ἀμεσσίας ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ.
**4** Πλὴν τῶν ὑψηλῶν οὐκ ἐξῆρεν· ἔτι δ᾽ὁ λαὸς ἐθυσίαζε, καὶ ἐθυμίμων ἐν τοῖς ὑψηλοῖς.
**5** Καὶ ἥψατο Κύριος τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ ἦν λελεπρωμένος ἕως ἡμέρας θανάτου αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν οἴκῳ Ἀφφουσιώθ. Καὶ Ἰωαθὰμ υἱὸς τοῦ βασιλέως ἐπὶ τῷ οἴκῳ κρίνων τὸν λαὸν τῆς γῆς.
**6** Καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Ἀζαρίου, καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν, οὐχὶ ταῦτα γεγραμμένα ἐν βιβλίῳ λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν Ἰούδα;
**7** Καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Ἀζαρίας μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ,

**Literary Translation:**

### 2 Kings 14

**23** [And he slept] with his fathers. In the fifteenth year of Amaziah, the son of Joash, king of Judah, Jeroboam, the son of Joash, king of Israel, began to reign over Israel in Samaria, [and he reigned] for forty and one years.
**24** And he wrought that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin.
**25** He restored the border of Israel from the entrance of Hamath even unto the Sea of the Arabah, according to the word of the LORD God of Israel, which He spake by the hand of His servant Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet, who was from Gath-hepher.
**26** For the LORD saw the affliction of Israel, that it was exceedingly bitter, and [that] they who were oppressed were few, and impoverished, and forsaken; and there was no helper for Israel.
**27** And the LORD had not spoken to blot out the name of Israel from under heaven; and He saved them by the hand of Jeroboam, the son of Joash.
**28** Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his mighty deeds, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath for Judah in Israel, behold, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
**29** And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of Israel; and Zachariah, his son, reigned in the stead of his father.

### 2 Kings 15

**1** In the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam, king of Israel, Azariah, the son of Amaziah, king of Judah, began to reign.
**2** Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign, and fifty and two years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem.
**3** And he did that which was good in the sight of the LORD, according to all that Amaziah, his father, had done.
**4** Howbeit the high places were not removed; the people still sacrificed and offered incense upon the high places.
**5** And the LORD smote the king, and he was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a separate house, in Aphphusioth. And Jotham, the king's son, was over the royal house, judging the people of the land.
**6** Now the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, behold, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
**7** And Azariah slept with his fathers,
