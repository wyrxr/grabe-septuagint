εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ καὶ ἐν Ἰούδα, καὶ κατήργησαν αὐτοὺς ἐν ἵπποις
24 καὶ δυνάμει. Τότε ἤργησε τὸ ἔργον οἴκου τοῦ Θεοῦ τὸ ἐν Ἱερου-

τοῦ βασιλέως Περσῶν.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐπροφήτευσεν Ἀγγαῖος ὁ προφήτης καὶ Ζαχαρίας ὁ τοῦ
Ἀδδὼ προφητείαν ἐπὶ τοὺς Ἰουδαίους τοὺς ἐν Ἰούδα καὶ Ἱερου-
2 σαλὴμ ἐν ὀνόματι Κυρίου Θεοῦ Ἰσραὴλ ἐπ᾽ αὐτούς. Τότε ἀνέση-
σαν Ζοροβάβελ ὁ τοῦ Σαλαθιὴλ καὶ Ἰησοῦς υἱὸς Ἰωσεδέκ, καὶ ἤρ-
ξαντο οἰκοδομεῖν τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Θεοῦ τὸν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ· καὶ μετ᾽
3 αὐτῶν οἱ προφῆται τοῦ Θεοῦ βοηθοῦντες αὐτοῖς. Ἐν αὐτῷ τῷ
καιρῷ ἦλθεν ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς Θαθθαναὶ ἔπαρχος πέραν τοῦ ποταμοῦ,
καὶ Σαθαρβουζαναὶ, καὶ οἱ σύνδουλοι αὐτῶν, καὶ τοῖα εἶπον αὐ-
τοῖς· τίς ἔθηκεν ὑμῖν γνώμην τοῦ οἰκοδομῆσαι τὸν οἶκον τοῦτον,
4 καὶ τὴν χορηγίαν ταύτην καταρτίσασθαι; Τότε ταῦτα εἶπον αὐ-
τοῖς· τίνα ἐστι τὰ ὀνόματα τῶν ἀνδρῶν τῶν οἰκοδομούντων τὴν
5 πόλιν ταύτην; Καὶ οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν
Ἰούδα, καὶ οὐ κατήργησαν αὐτοὺς ἕως γνώμη τῷ Δαρείῳ ἀπ-
6 ηνέχθη. καὶ τότε ἀπεστάλη τῷ φορολόγῳ ὑπὲρ τούτου. Διασά-
φησις ἐπιστολῆς ἧς ἀπέστειλε Θαθθαναὶς ὁ ἔπαρχος τοῦ πέραν τοῦ
ποταμοῦ· καὶ Σαθαρβουζαναὶ, καὶ οἱ σύνδουλοι αὐτῶν Ἀφαρσα-
7 χαῖοι, οἱ ἐν τῷ πέραν τοῦ ποταμοῦ, Δαρείῳ τῷ βασιλεῖ, ῥῆσιν ἀπ-
έστειλαν πρὸς αὐτόν. καὶ τάδε γέγραπται ἐν αὐτῇ· Δαρείῳ τῷ
8 βασιλεῖ εἰρήνη πᾶσα· Γνωστὸν ἔστω τῷ βασιλεῖ, ὅτι ἐπορεύθη-
μεν εἰς τὴν Ἰουδαίαν χώραν εἰς οἶκον τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ μεγάλου, καὶ
αὐτὸς οἰκοδομεῖται λίθοις ἐκλεκτοῖς, καὶ ξύλα ἐντίθεται ἐν τοῖς
τοίχοις, καὶ τὸ ἔργον ἐκεῖνο ἐπιδέξιον γίγνεται, καὶ εὐοδοῦται ἐν
9 χερσὶν αὐτῶν. Τότε ἠρωτήσαμεν τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους ἐκείνους, καὶ
οὕτως εἴπομεν αὐτοῖς· τίς ἔθηκεν ὑμῖν γνώμην τὸν οἶκον τοῦτον
10 οἰκοδομῆσαι, καὶ τὴν χορηγίαν ταύτην καταρτίσασθαι; Καὶ τὰ
ὀνόματα αὐτῶν ἠρωτήσαμεν αὐτοὺς γνωρίσαι σοι, ὥστε γράψαι
11 σοι τὰ ὀνόματα τῶν ἀνδρῶν τῶν ἀρχόντων αὐτῶν. Καὶ τοιοῦτο
ῥῆμα ἀπεκρίθησαν ἡμῖν, λέγοντες, ἡμεῖς ἐσμὲν δοῦλοι τοῦ Θεοῦ
τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ τῆς γῆς, καὶ οἰκοδομοῦμεν τὸν οἶκον, ὃς ἦν ᾠκο-

**EZRA. CHAPTER 4.**

²⁴ into Jerusalem and in Judea, and made them cease with horses and with might. So the work of the house of God which was in Jerusalem ceased. And it remained at a standstill until the second year of the reign of Darius, the king of Persia.

**CHAPTER 5.**

¹ Then prophesied Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Addo, a prophecy unto the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem, in the Name of the Lord God of Israel, even unto them.
² Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jesus the son of Jozadak, and they began to build the house of God which was in Jerusalem; and with them were the prophets of God, aiding them.
³ At that same time came unto them Tatnai, the governor beyond the river, and Shethar-boznai, and their fellow servants, and they spake thus unto them, saying: "Who hath given you counsel to build this house, and to complete this provision?"
⁴ Then they answered them, saying: "What are the names of the men who build this city?"
⁵ But the eyes of God were upon the captivity of Judah, and they did not cause them to cease, until a decree was brought unto Darius.
⁶ And then was [a report] sent unto the tax-collector concerning this matter. This is the copy of the letter which Tatnai, the governor beyond the river, and Shethar-boznai, and their fellow servants, the Apharsachites, who were beyond the river, sent unto Darius the king, yea, a message they sent unto him.
⁷ And thus was it written therein: "To Darius the king, all peace.
⁸ Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judea, unto the house of the great God, and it is built with costly stones, and timber is laid in the walls thereof, and that work is wrought with skillful hands, and it doth prosper in their hands.
⁹ Then asked we those elders, and we spake thus unto them: 'Who hath given you counsel to build this house, and to complete this provision?
¹⁰ And we asked them to make known unto thee their names, so that we might write unto thee the names of the men who are their rulers.'
¹¹ And such a word they answered us, saying: 'We are the servants of the God of heaven and of earth, and we build the house which was built—"
