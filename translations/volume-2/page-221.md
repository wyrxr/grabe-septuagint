1 Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν ἔτει τρίτῳ τῷ Ὡσηὲ υἱῷ Ἡλὰ βασιλεῖ Ἰσραὴλ ἐβασίλευσεν Ἑζεκίας υἱὸς Ἄχαζ βασιλέως Ἰούδα.
2 Υἱὸς εἴκοσι καὶ πέντε ἐτῶν ἦν ἐν τῷ βασιλεύειν αὐτόν, καὶ εἴκοσι καὶ ἐννέα ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ὄνομα τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ Ἄβου, θυγάτηρ Ζαχαρίου.
3 Καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ εὐθὲς ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς Κυρίου κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησε Δαυὶδ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ.
4 Αὐτὸς ἐξῆρε τὰ ὑψηλά, καὶ συνέτριψε πάσας τὰς στήλας, καὶ ἐξωλέθρευσε τὰ ἄλση, καὶ τὸν ὄφιν τὸν χαλκοῦν ὃν ἐποίησε Μωσῆς, ὅτι ἕως τῶν ἡμερῶν ἐκείνων ἦσαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ θυμιῶντες αὐτῷ. Καὶ ἐκάλεσεν αὐτὸν Νεσθάν.
5 Ἐν Κυρίῳ Θεῷ Ἰσραὴλ ἤλπισε, καὶ μετ᾽ αὐτὸν οὐκ ἐγενήθη ὅμοιος αὐτῷ ἐν πᾶσι βασιλεῦσιν Ἰούδα, καὶ τοῖς γενομένοις ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ·
6 καὶ ἐκολλήθη τῷ Κυρίῳ· οὐκ ἀπέστη ὄπισθεν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐφύλαξε τὰς ἐντολὰς αὐτοῦ ὅσας ἐνετείλατο Μωσῆ.
7 Καὶ ἦν Κύριος μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ, ἐν πᾶσιν οἷς ἐποίει συνῆκε· καὶ ἠθέτησεν ἐν τῷ βασιλεῖ Ἀσσυρίων, καὶ οὐκ ἐδούλευσεν αὐτῷ.
8 Αὐτὸς ἐπάταξε τοὺς ἀλλοφύλους ἕως Γάζης, καὶ ἕως ὁρίου αὐτῆς ἀπὸ πύργου φυλασσόντων, καὶ ἕως πόλεως ὀχυρᾶς.
9 Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἔτει τῷ τετάρτῳ βασιλεῖ Ἑζεκία, αὐτὸς ὁ ἐνιαυτὸς ὁ ἔβδομος τῷ Ὡσηὲ υἱῷ Ἡλὰ βασιλεῖ Ἰσραὴλ, ἀνέβη Σαλαμανασσὰρ βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων ἐπὶ Σαμάρειαν, καὶ ἐπολιόρκει ἐπ᾽ αὐτήν,
10 καὶ κατελάβετο αὐτὴν ἀπὸ τέλους τριῶν ἐτῶν ἐν ἔτει ἔκτῳ τῷ Ἑζεκία, οὗτος ἐνιαυτὸς ἔννατος τῷ Ὡσηὲ βασιλεῖ Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ συνελήφθη Σαμάρει̃α.
11 Καὶ ἀπῴκισεν βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων τὴν Σαμάρειαν εἰς Ἀσσυρίους, καὶ ἔθηκεν αὐτοὺς ἐν Ἀλαέ, καὶ ἐν Ἀβὼρ ποταμῷ Γωζάν, καὶ Ὄρη Μήδων,
12 ὅτι οὐκ ἤκουσαν τῆς φωνῆς Κυρίου Θεοῦ αὐτῶν, καὶ παρέβησαν τὴν διαθήκην αὐτοῦ, πάντα ὅσα ἐνετείλατο Μωσῆς δοῦλος Κυρίου, καὶ οὐκ ἤκουσαν, καὶ οὐκ ἐποίησαν.
13 Καὶ τῷ τεσσαρεσκαιδεκάτῳ ἔτει τοῦ βασιλέως Ἑζεκίου ἀνέβη Σεναχηρεὶμ βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων ἐπὶ τὰς πόλεις Ἰούδα τὰς ὀχυρὰς, καὶ συνέλαβεν αὐτάς.
14 Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ἑζεκίας βασιλεὺς Ἰούδα ἀγγέλους πρὸς βασιλέα Ἀσσυρίων εἰς Λαχεῖς, λέγων· ἡμάρτηκα, ἀποστράφηθι ἀπ᾽ ἐμοῦ· ὃ ἐὰν ἐπιθῇς ἐπ᾽ ἐμὲ, βαστάσω.
15 Καὶ ἐπέθηκεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων ἐπὶ Ἑζεκίαν βασιλέα Ἰούδα τριακόσια τάλαντα ἀργυρίου, καὶ τριάκοντα τάλαντα χρυσίου.
16 Καὶ ἔδωκεν Ἑζεκίας πᾶν τὸ ἀργύριον τὸ εὑρεθὲν ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου, καὶ ἐν θησαυροῖς οἴκου τοῦ βασιλέως.
17 Ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ συνέκοψεν Ἑζεκίας τὰς θύρας ναοῦ Κυρίου, καὶ τὰ ἐστηριγμένα ἃ ἐχρύσωσεν Ἑζεκίας βασιλεὺς Ἰούδα, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὰ βασιλεῖ Ἀσσυρίων.
18 Καὶ ἀπέστειλε βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων τὸν Θαρθαν, καὶ τὸν Ῥαβσαρεῖς, καὶ τὸν Ῥαψάκην ἐκ Λαχεὶς πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Ἑζεκίαν ἐν δυνάμει βαρείᾳ ἐπὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ.
19 Καὶ ἀνέβησαν, καὶ ἦλθον εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἔστησαν ἐν τῷ ὑδραγωγῷ τῆς κολυμβήθρας τῆς ἄνω, ἥ ἐστιν ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ τοῦ ἀγροῦ τοῦ γναφέως.
20 Καὶ ἐβόησαν πρὸς Ἑζεκίαν, καὶ ἦλθον πρὸς αὐτὸν Ἑλιακεὶμ ὁ υἱὸς Χελκίου ὁ οἰκονόμος, καὶ Σομνὰς ὁ γραμματεύς, καὶ Ἰωὰς ὁ υἱὸς Σαφὰτ ὁ ἀναμιμνήσκων.
21 Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτοὺς Ῥαψάκης· εἴπατε δὴ πρὸς Ἑζεκίαν· τάδε λέγει ὁ βασιλεὺς ὁ μέγας, βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων.
22 τίς ἡ πεποίθησις αὕτη ἣν πέποιθας; Εἶπας· πλὴν λόγοι χειλέων, βουλὴ καὶ δύναμις εἰς πόλεμον· καὶ νῦν τίνι πεποιθὼς ἠθέτησας ἐν ἐμοί;
23 Νῦν ἰδοὺ πέποιθας σαυτῷ ἐπὶ τὴν ῥάβδον τὴν καλαμίνην τὴν τεθλασμένην ταύτην, ἐπ᾽ Αἴγυπτον; ὃς ἂν στηριχθῇ ἀνὴρ ἐπ᾽ αὐτήν, καὶ εἰσελεύσεται εἰς τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ, καὶ τρυπήσει αὐτήν.
24 οὕτως Φαραὼ βασιλεὺς Αἰγύπτου πᾶσι τοῖς πεποιθόσιν ἐπ᾽ αὐτόν.
25 Καὶ ὅτι εἶπας πρὸς μέ, ἐπὶ Κύριον Θεὸν πεποίθαμεν· οὐχὶ αὐτὸς οὗτος οὐ ἀπέστησεν Ἑζεκίας τὰ ὑψηλὰ αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰ θυσιαστήρια αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπε τῷ Ἰούδα, καὶ τῇ Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐνώπιον τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου τούτου προσκυνήσετε ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ;
26 Καὶ νῦν μίχθητε δὴ τῷ κυρίῳ μου, τῷ βασιλεῖ Ἀσσυρίων, καὶ δώσω σοι δισχιλίους ἵππους, εἰ δυνήσῃ δοῦναι σαυτῷ ἐπιβάτας ἐπ᾽ αὐτούς.
27 Καὶ πῶς ἀποστρέψεις τὸ πρόσωπον τοπάρχου ἑνὸς τῶν δούλων τοῦ κυρίου μου τῶν ἐλαχίστων; καὶ ἤλπισας σαυτῷ ἐπ᾽ Αἴγυπτον εἰς ἅρματα · καὶ ἱππεῖς;
28 Νῦν οὖν μὴ ἄνευ Κυρίου ἀνέβημεν ἐπὶ τὸν τόπον τοῦτον τοῦ διαφθεῖραι αὐτόν· Κύριος εἶπε πρὸς μέ, ἀνάβηθι ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ταύτην, καὶ διάφθειρον αὐτήν.
29 Καὶ εἶπεν · Ἑλιακεὶμ ὁ υἱὸς Χελκίου, καὶ Σομνάς, καὶ Ἰωὰς πρὸς Ῥαψάκην · λάλησον δὴ πρὸς τοὺς παῖδάς σου Συριστί, ὅτι ἀκούομεν ἡμεῖς, καὶ οὐ λαλήσεις πρὸς ἡμᾶς Ἰουδαϊστὶ ἐν τοῖς ὠσὶ τοῦ λαοῦ τοῦ ἐπὶ τοῦ τείχους.
30 Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτοὺς Ῥαψάκης· μὴ πρὸς τὸν κύριόν σου, καὶ πρὸς σὲ ἀπέστειλέ με ὁ κύριός μου λαλῆσαι τοὺς λόγους τούτους;

### Literary Translation:

### 2 Kings 18

**1** And it came to pass in the third year of Hosea, son of Elah, king of Israel, that Hezekiah, the son of Ahaz, king of Judah, began to reign.
**2** He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And the name of his mother was Abou, the daughter of Zechariah.
**3** And he did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that David his father had done.
**4** He removed the high places, and broke in pieces all the pillars, and cut down the sacred poles, and the bronze serpent that Moses had made; for unto those days the sons of Israel were burning incense unto it. And he called it Nesthan.
**5** In the LORD God of Israel did he put his trust; and after him there was none like him among all the kings of Judah, neither among those who were before him.
**6** For he clave unto the LORD, and departed not from following Him, but kept His commandments, which He commanded Moses.
**7** And the LORD was with him; and in all that he undertook, he prospered. And he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not.
**8** He smote the Philistines even unto Gaza, and unto its border, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city.
**9** And it came to pass in the fourth year of King Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hosea, son of Elah, king of Israel, that Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, came up against Samaria, and besieged it.
**10** And he took it at the end of three years, in the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Hosea, king of Israel; and Samaria was taken.
**11** And the king of Assyria carried away the people of Samaria into Assyria, and placed them in Halah, and in Habor by the river Gozan, and in the Mountains of the Medes;
**12** because they hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD their God, but transgressed His covenant, even all that Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded; and they hearkened not, neither did they perform [it].
**13** And in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, came up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them.
**14** And Hezekiah, king of Judah, sent messengers to the king of Assyria at Lachish, saying, "I have sinned; turn back from me. Whatsoever thou shalt lay upon me, I will bear." And the king of Assyria laid upon Hezekiah, king of Judah, three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.
**15** And Hezekiah gave all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasuries of the king's house.
**16** At that time Hezekiah stripped the doors of the temple of the LORD, and the doorposts which Hezekiah, king of Judah, had overlaid with gold, and gave them to the king of Assyria.
**17** And the king of Assyria sent Tartan, and Rab-saris, and Rabshakeh from Lachish to King Hezekiah with a great army against Jerusalem.
**18** And they went up, and came to Jerusalem, and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller's field.
**19** And they called out to Hezekiah; and there came forth to them Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Shaphat, the recorder.
**20** And Rabshakeh said unto them, "Say now to Hezekiah, 'Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria: What confidence is this wherein thou trustest? Thou sayest, [but these are] but words of lips, [that there is] counsel and strength for war. And now, in whom dost thou trust, that thou hast rebelled against me?'"
**21** "Now, behold, thou trustest in thyself upon this broken reed-staff, upon Egypt, upon which if a man lean, it shall go into his hand, and pierce it.
**22** So is Pharaoh, king of Egypt, unto all that trust in him. And if ye say unto me, 'We trust in the LORD our God': is it not he, even this Hezekiah, who hath removed His high places and His altars, and hath said to Judah and Jerusalem, 'Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem'?"
**23** "Now therefore, I pray thee, make a pledge to my lord the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.
**24** And how then wilt thou turn away the face of one governor, even of the least of my master's servants? And dost thou hope in thyself for Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
**25** Now, therefore, have we come up without the LORD against this place to destroy it? The LORD said unto me, 'Go up against this land, and destroy it.'"
**26** And Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah, said unto Rabshakeh, "Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian tongue, for we understand it; and speak not to us in the Jews' language in the ears of the people that are on the wall."
**27** And Rabshakeh said unto them, "Hath my master sent me [only] unto thy master, and unto thee, to speak these words?"
