ΚΕΦ. ϛ΄. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Δ΄. 671
πάντας τοὺς λόγους, οὓς ἐὰν λαλήσῃς ἐν τῷ ταμείῳ τοῦ κοιτῶνος
σου. Καὶ εἶπε· δεῦτε, ἴδετε ποῦ αὐτός, καὶ ἀποστείλας λήψομαι 13
αὐτόν. Καὶ ἀνήγγειλαν αὐτῷ, λέγοντες· Ἰδοὺ ἐν Δωθαείμ. Καὶ 14
ἀπέστειλεν ἐκεῖ ἵππον, καὶ ἅρμα, καὶ δύναμιν βαρεῖαν· καὶ ἦλθαν
νυκτός, καὶ περιεκύκλωσαν τὴν πόλιν. Καὶ ὤρθρισε λειτουργός Ἐ- 15
λισσαῖ ἀναστῆναι, καὶ ἐξῆλθε· καὶ ἰδοὺ δύναμις κυκλοῦσα τὴν πό-
λιν, καὶ ἵππος, καὶ ἅρμα· καὶ εἶπε τὸ παιδάριον πρὸς αὐτόν· ὦ
κύριε, πῶς ποιήσομεν ; καὶ εἶπεν Ἐλισσαῖε· μὴ φοβοῦ, ὅτι πλείους 16
οἱ μεθ᾽ ἡμῶν ὑπὲρ τοὺς μετ᾽ αὐτῶν· Καὶ προσηύξατο Ἐλισσαῖε, 17
καὶ εἶπε· Κύριε, διάνοιξον δὴ τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς τοῦ παιδαρίου, καὶ
ἰδέτω. καὶ διήνοιξε Κύριος τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἴδε· καὶ
ἰδοὺ τὸ ὄρος πλῆρες ἵππων, καὶ ἅρμα πυρὸς περικύκλῳ Ἐλισσαῖε.
Καὶ κατέβησαν πρὸς αὐτόν· καὶ προσηύξατο Ἐλισσαῖε πρὸς Κύ- 18
ριον, καὶ εἶπε· πάταξον δὴ τοῦτο τὸ ἔθνος ἀορασίᾳ· καὶ ἐπάταξεν
αὐτοὺς ἀορασίᾳ κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα Ἐλισσαῖε. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτοὺς 19
Ἐλισσαῖε· οὐχ αὕτη ἡ ὁδός· καὶ οὐχ αὕτη ἡ πόλις· δεῦτε ὀπί-
σω μου, καὶ ἀπάξω ὑμᾶς πρὸς τὸν ἄνδρα ὃν ζητεῖτε· καὶ ἀπή-
γαγεν αὐτοὺς εἰς Σαμάρειαν. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς εἰσῆλθον εἰς Σα- 20
μάρειαν, καὶ εἶπεν Ἐλισσαῖε· ἄνοιξον δὴ, Κύριε, τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς
αὐτῶν, καὶ ἰδέτωσαν, καὶ διήνοιξε Κύριος τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτῶν,
καὶ εἶδαν· καὶ ἰδοὺ ἦσαν ἐν μέσῳ Σαμαρείας. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασι- 21
λεὺς Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς Ἐλισσαῖε, ὡς εἶδεν αὐτούς· εἰ πατάξας πατά-
ξω, πάτερ; Καὶ εἶπεν· οὐ πατάξεις, εἰ μὴ οὓς ἠχμαλώτευσας ἐν 22
ῥομφαίᾳ σου καὶ τόξῳ σου, σὺ τύπτεις· παράθες ἄρτους καὶ ὕδωρ
ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν, καὶ φαγέτωσαν, καὶ πιέτωσαν, καὶ ἀπελθέτωσαν
πρὸς τὸν κύριον αὐτῶν. Καὶ παρέθηκεν αὐτοῖς παράθεσιν μεγά- 23
λην, καὶ ἔφαγον, καὶ ἔπιον· καὶ ἀπέστειλεν αὐτούς, καὶ ἀπῆλθον
πρὸς τὸν κύριον αὐτῶν· καὶ οὐ προσέθεντο ἔτι μονόζωνοι Συρίας
τοῦ ἐλθεῖν εἰς γῆν Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ ταῦτα, καὶ ἤθροι- 24
σεν υἱὸς Ἄδερ βασιλεὺς Συρίας πᾶσαν τὴν παρεμβολὴν αὐτοῦ,
καὶ ἀνέβη, καὶ περιεκάθισε ἐπὶ Σαμάρειαν. Καὶ ἐγένετο λιμὸς μέ- 25
γας ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ· καὶ ἰδοὺ περικάθηντο περὶ αὐτήν, ἕως οὗ ἐ-
γενήθη κεφαλὴ ὄνου πεντήκοντα ἀργυρίου, καὶ τέσσαρες κάβοι κό-
πρου περιστερῶν (πεντήκοντα) πέντε ἀργυρίου. Καὶ ἦν ὁ βασιλεὺς 26
Ἰσραὴλ διαπορευόμενος ἐπὶ τοῦ τείχους· καὶ γυνὴ ἐβόησε πρὸς αὐ-
τὸν, λέγουσα· σῶσον, κύριε βασιλεῦ. Καὶ εἶπε· μὴ σὲ σώσῃ Κύ- 27

**CHAPTER SIX.**

**12** all the words which thou speakest in thy bedchamber."
**13** And he said, "Go and see where he is, that I may send and fetch him." And they told him, saying, "Behold, he is in Dothan."
**14** Then sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a heavy host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about.
**15** And when the servant of Elisha was risen early and gone forth, behold, a host compassed the city, both with horses and chariots. And his young man said unto him, "Alas, my master! what shall we do?"
**16** And Elisha answered, "Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them."
**17** And Elisha prayed, and said, "O Lord, I pray Thee, open his eyes, that he may see." And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.
**18** And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the Lord, and said, "Smite this people, I pray Thee, with blindness." And He smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.
**19** And Elisha said unto them, "This is not the way, neither is this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek." And he led them to Samaria.
**20** And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said, "Lord, open, I pray Thee, the eyes of these men, that they may see." And the Lord opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.
**21** And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, "My father, shall I smite them? shall I smite them?"
**22** And he answered, "Thou shalt not smite them. Wouldst thou strike those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow? Set bread and water before them, that they may eat, and drink, and go to their master."
**23** And he prepared for them a great repast: and they did eat and drink, and he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the raiding bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.
**24** And it came to pass after these things, that the son of Ader, king of Syria, gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.
**25** And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until a donkey's head was [sold for] fifty pieces of silver, and four kabs of dove's dung [for] (fifty) five pieces of silver.
**26** And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman unto him, saying, "Help, my lord, O king!"
**27** And he said, "May the Lord not save thee!"
