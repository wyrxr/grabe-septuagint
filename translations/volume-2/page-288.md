764 ΠΑΡΑΛΕΙΠΟΜΕΝΩΝ ΚΕΦ. ΚΘʹ
οὐρανῷ καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς δεσπόζεις. ἀπὸ προσώπου σοῦ ταράσσεται
12 πᾶς βασιλεύς, καὶ ἔθνος. Παρὰ σοῦ ὁ πλοῦτος, καὶ ἡ δόξα, σὺ πάν-
των ἄρχεις, Κύριε, ὁ ἄρχων πάσης ἀρχῆς, καὶ ἐν χειρί σου ἰσχὺς καὶ
δυναστεία, καὶ ἐν χειρί σου ἔλεος, παντοκράτωρ μεγαλῦναι καὶ
13 κατισχύσαι τὰ πάντα. Καὶ νῦν, Κύριε, ἐξομολογούμεθά σοι, καὶ
14 αἰνοῦμεν τὸ ὄνομα τῆς καυχήσεώς σου. Καὶ τίς εἰμι ἐγώ, καὶ τίς
ὁ λαός μου, ὅτι ἰσχύσαμεν προθυμηθῆναι σοι κατὰ ταῦτα; ὅτι
15 σὰ τὰ πάντα, καὶ ἐκ τῶν σῶν δεδώκαμέν σοι· ὅτι πάροικοι ἐσμὲν
ἐναντίον σου, καὶ παροικοῦντες, ὡς πάντες οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν· ὡς
16 σκιὰ αἱ ἡμέραι ἡμῶν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ὑπομονή. Κύριε,
ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν, πρὸς πᾶν τὸ πλῆθος τοῦτο, ὃ ἡτοίμακα οἰκοδομη-
θῆναι οἶκον τῷ ὀνόματι τῷ ἁγίῳ σου, ἐκ χειρός σου ἐστὶ, καὶ σοὶ
17 τὰ πάντα. Καὶ ἔγνων, Κύριε, ὅτι σὺ εἶ ὁ ἐτάζων καρδίας, καὶ
δικαιοσύνην ἀγαπᾷς. ἐν ἁπλότητι καρδίας προεθυμήθην ταῦτα
πάντα, καὶ νῦν τὸν λαόν σου τὸν εὑρεθέντα ὧδε εἶδον ἐν εὐφροσύ-
18 νῃ προθυμηθέντα σοι. Κύριε ὁ Θεὸς Ἀβραάμ, καὶ Ἰσαάκ, καὶ
Ἰσραὴλ τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν, φύλαξον ταῦτα ἐν διανοίᾳ καρδίας
λαοῦ σου εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, καὶ κατεύθυνον τὰς καρδίας αὐτῶν πρὸς
19 σέ. Καὶ Σαλωμὼν τῷ υἱῷ μου δὸς καρδίαν ἀγαθὴν ποιεῖν τὰς ἐν-
τολάς σου, καὶ τὰ μαρτύριά σου, καὶ τὰ προστάγματά σου, καὶ
τοῦ ἐπὶ τέλος ἀγαγεῖν τὴν κατασκευὴν τοῦ οἴκου σου. Καὶ εἶ-
20 πε Δαυὶδ πάσῃ τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ· εὐλογήσατε Κύριον τὸν Θεὸν ὑμῶν.
καὶ εὐλόγησε πᾶσα ἡ ἐκκλησία τὸν Κύριον Θεὸν τῶν πατέρων
αὐτῶν· καὶ κάμψαντες τὰ γόνατα προσεκύνησαν τῷ Κυρίῳ, καὶ
21 τῷ βασιλεῖ. Καὶ ἔθυσε Δαυὶδ τῷ Κυρίῳ θυσίας, καὶ ἀνήνεγκεν
ὁλοκαυτώματα τῷ Θεῷ τῇ ἐπαύριον τῆς πρώτης ἡμέρας, μόσχους
χιλίους, κριοὺς χιλίους, ἄρνας χιλίους, καὶ τὰς σπονδὰς αὐτῶν,
22 καὶ θυσίας εἰς πλῆθος παντὶ τῷ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἔφαγον, καὶ ἔπιον
ἐναντίον Κυρίου ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ μετὰ χαρᾶς, καὶ ἐβασίλευ-
σαν ἐκ δευτέρου τὸν Σαλωμὼν υἱὸν Δαυίδ, καὶ ἔχρισαν αὐτὸν τῷ
23 Κυρίῳ εἰς βασιλέα, καὶ Σαδὼκ εἰς ἱερωσύνην. Καὶ ἐκάθισε Σαλω-
μὼν ἐπὶ θρόνου Δαυὶδ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ηὐδοκήθη· καὶ ὑπή-
24 κουσαν αὐτοῦ πᾶς Ἰσραήλ. Οἱ ἄρχοντες, καὶ οἱ δυνάσται, καὶ
πάντες υἱοὶ τοῦ βασιλέως Δαυὶδ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ ὑπετάγησαν αὐτῷ.
25 Καὶ ἐμεγάλυνε Κύριος τὸν Σαλωμὼν ἐπάνωθεν ἐναντίον παντὸς
Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ δόξαν βασιλέως, ὃ οὐκ ἐγένετο ἐπὶ παν-

`11` ...heaven and upon the earth Thou art Lord.
    From before Thy countenance is every king and nation troubled.
`12` From Thee cometh wealth and glory,
    and Thou reignest over all, O Lord, the Sovereign of every dominion;
    and in Thy hand is strength and might,
    and in Thy hand is mercy.
    O Almighty, [it is Thine] to make great and to strengthen all things.
`13` And now, O Lord, we give thanks unto Thee,
    and we praise the Name of Thy glory.
`14` But who am I, and who [is] my people,
    that we should have been able to offer willingly unto Thee after this manner?
    For Thine are all things,
    and from Thine own have we given unto Thee.
`15` For we are sojourners before Thee,
    and strangers, as were all our fathers.
    Our days upon the earth are as a shadow,
    and there is no abiding.
`16` O Lord, our God, all this abundance,
    which I have prepared to build a house for Thy holy Name,
    it is from Thy hand, and Thine are all things.
`17` And I know, O Lord, that Thou art He who searcheth hearts,
    and lovest righteousness.
    In uprightness of heart have I offered willingly all these things;
    and now have I seen with joy Thy people,
    who are found here, to offer willingly unto Thee.
`18` O Lord, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers,
    keep these things for ever in the imagination of the heart of Thy people,
    and direct their hearts unto Thee.
`19` And to Solomon my son, give a perfect heart,
    to keep Thy commandments, and Thy testimonies, and Thy statutes;
    and to bring to completion the construction of Thy House.
`20` And David said unto all the congregation,
    "Bless ye the Lord your God."
    And all the congregation blessed the Lord God of their fathers,
    and bowed their knees and worshipped the Lord, and the king.
`21` And David offered sacrifices unto the Lord,
    and offered up burnt offerings unto God on the morrow after the first day:
    a thousand calves, a thousand rams, a thousand lambs,
    with their drink offerings,
    and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel.
`22` And they ate and drank before the Lord on that day with great joy.
    And they made Solomon, David's son, king a second time,
    and anointed him unto the Lord as king,
    and Zadok for the priesthood.
`23` And Solomon sat upon the throne of David his father,
    and he was prospered;
    and all Israel obeyed him.
`24` The rulers, and the mighty men,
    and all the sons of King David his father,
    submitted themselves unto him.
`25` And the Lord magnified Solomon exceedingly
    before all Israel,
    and gave him royal glory,
    which had not been upon any [king]
