τέλεσε. Καὶ ἦσαν τῷ Σαλωμὼν ἑβδομήκοντα χιλιάδες αἴροντες
ἄρσιν, καὶ ὀγδοήκοντα χιλιάδες λατόμων ἐν τῷ ὄρει. Καὶ ἐποίη-
σε Σαλωμὼν τὴν θάλασσαν, καὶ τὰ ὑποστηρίγματα, καὶ τοὺς λου-
τῆρας τοὺς μεγάλους, καὶ τοὺς στύλους, καὶ τὴν κρήνην τῆς αὐ-
λῆς, καὶ τὴν θάλασσαν τὴν χαλκὴν˙ καὶ ᾠκοδόμησε τὴν ἄκραν
ἔπαλξιν ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς, διέκοψε τὴν πόλιν Δαυΐδ. οὕτως θυγάτηρ Φα-
ραὼ ἀνέβαινεν ἐκ τῆς πόλεως Δαυΐδ εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτῆς, ὃν ᾠ-
κοδόμησεν αὐτῇ. Τότε ᾠκοδόμησε τὴν ἄκραν˙ καὶ Σαλωμὼν ἀ-
νέφερε τρεῖς ἐν τῷ ἐνιαυτῷ ὁλοκαυτώσεις, καὶ εἰρηνικὰς ἐπὶ τὸ
θυσιαστήριον ὃ ᾠκοδόμησε τῷ Κυρίῳ, καὶ ἐθυμία ἐνώπιον Κυρίου,
καὶ συνετέλεσε τὸν οἶκον. Καὶ ἰδοὺ οἱ ἄρχοντες οἱ ἐκκαθεστα-
μένοι ἐπὶ τὰ ἔργα τοῦ Σαλωμὼν, τρεῖς χιλιάδες καὶ ἑξακόσιοι
ἐπιστάται τοῦ λαοῦ τῶν ποιοῦντων τὰ ἔργα. Καὶ ᾠκοδόμησε
τὴν Ἀσοὺρ, καὶ τὴν Μαγδὼ, καὶ τὴν Γαζὲρ, καὶ τὴν Βαιθω-
ρὼθ ἐπάνω, καὶ τὰ Βαλαλάθ˙ πλὴν μετὰ τὸ οἰκοδομῆσαι αὐτὸν
τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Κυρίου, καὶ τὸ τεῖχος Ἱερουσαλὴμ κύκλῳ, μετὰ
ταῦτα ᾠκοδόμησε τὰς πόλεις ταύτας. Καὶ ἐν τῷ ἔτι ζῆν Δαυΐδ,
ἐνετείλατο Σαλωμὼν, λέγων˙ ἰδοὺ μετὰ σοῦ Σεμεεὶ υἱὸς Γηρᾶ,
υἱὸς σπέρματος τοῦ Ἰεμενεὶ, ἐκ Χεβρὼν οὗτος κατηράσατό με
κατάραν ὀδυνηρὰν ἐν ᾗ ἡμέρᾳ ἐπορευόμην εἰς παρεμβολὰς, καὶ αὐ-
τὸς κατέβαινεν εἰς ἀπάντησίν μοι ἐπὶ τὸν Ἰορδάνην, καὶ ὤμοσα
αὐτῷ κατὰ τοῦ Κυρίου, λέγων˙ εἰ θανατωθήσεται ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ.
Καὶ νῦν μὴ ἀθωώσῃς αὐτὸν, ὅτι ἀνὴρ φρόνιμος εἶ σύ˙ καὶ γνώ-
σῃ ἃ ποιήσεις αὐτῷ, καὶ καταάξεις τὴν πολιὰν αὐτοῦ ἐν αἵματι εἰς
36 ᾅδου. Καὶ ἀποστείλας ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐκάλεσε τὸν Σεμεεὶ, καὶ εἶ-
πεν αὐτῷ˙ οἰκοδόμησον σεαυτῷ οἶκον ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ, καὶ κάθου
37 ἐκεῖ, καὶ οὐκ ἐξελεύσῃ ἐκεῖθεν οὐδαμοῦ. Καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ
τῆς ἐξοδίας σου καὶ διαβῇς τὸν χειμάρρουν Κέδρων, γνώσκων
γνῶσιν ὅτι θανάτῳ ἀποθανῇ˙ τὸ αἷμά σου ἔσται ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν
38 σου. Καὶ ὤρκισεν αὐτὸν ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ. Καὶ εἶ-
πε Σεμεεὶ πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα˙ ἀγαθὸν τὸ ῥῆμα ὃ ἐλάλησας, κύ-
ριέ μου βασιλεῦ˙ οὕτω ποιήσει ὁ δοῦλός σου. Καὶ ἐκάθισε Σεμεεὶ ἐν
39 Ἱερουσαλὴμ τρία ἔτη. Καὶ ἐγενήθη μετὰ τρία ἔτη, καὶ ἀπέδρα-
σαν δύο δοῦλοι τῷ Σεμεεὶ πρὸς Ἀγχὶς υἱὸν Μααχά, βασιλέα
40 Γέθ. Καὶ ἀπηγγέλη τῷ Σεμεεὶ, λέγοντες˙ ἰδοὺ οἱ δοῦλοί σου ἐν
Γέθ. Καὶ ἀνέστη Σεμεεὶ, καὶ ἐπέσαξε τὴν ὄνον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐ-

### A Royal Translation of the Third Book of Kingdoms, Chapter 2

**29** ...[he made and] completed [them].
And there were unto Solomon seventy thousand who bore burdens, and eighty thousand hewers of stone in the mountain.
And Solomon made the Sea, and the supports, and the great lavers, and the pillars, and the fountain of the court, and the bronze Sea. And he built the high battlement upon it, [and] he separated the City of David. Thus Pharaoh's daughter went up out of the City of David into her house, which he had built for her. Then he built the citadel. And Solomon offered three burnt offerings in the year, and peace offerings upon the altar which he had built unto the LORD. And he burned incense before the LORD, and he completed the house.
And behold, the officers who were appointed over the works of Solomon: three thousand and six hundred overseers of the people who performed the works.
And he built Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer, and Beth-Horon the Upper, and Baalath. Nevertheless, after he had built the house of the LORD and the wall of Jerusalem round about, after these things he built these cities.
And while David was yet alive, Solomon commanded, saying, "Behold, there is with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a son of the seed of Jemeni, from Hebron; this man cursed me with a grievous curse on the day I went to the encampments, and he himself came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I swore unto him by the LORD, saying: 'If he shall be put to death by the sword.' And now, do not hold him guiltless, for thou art a man of wisdom; and thou shalt know what thou shalt do unto him, and shalt bring down his gray hairs with blood to Hades."

**36** And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, "Build thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, **37** and thou shalt not go forth thence anywhere. And it shall be on the day of thy going out and thou shalt cross the Brook Kidron, thou shalt know with knowledge that thou shalt surely die by death; thy blood shall be upon thine own head." **38** And the king swore him on that day. And Shimei said unto the king, "Good is the word which thou hast spoken, my lord the king; so shall thy servant do." And Shimei dwelt in **39** Jerusalem three years. And it came to pass after three years, that two servants of Shimei fled unto Achish the son of Maachah, king of **40** Gath. And it was told Shimei, saying, "Behold, thy servants are in Gath." And Shimei arose, and saddled his donkey, and went...
