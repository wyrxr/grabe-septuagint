664             ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Δʹ.             ΚΕΦ. Γʹ.
νάμεων ᾧ παρέστην ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ, ὅτι εἰ μὴ πρόσωπον Ἰωσαφὰτ
βασιλέως Ἰούδα ἐγὼ λαμβάνω, εἰ ἐπέβλεψα πρὸς σὲ, καὶ ἴδον σε.
**15** Καὶ νῦν λάβετέ μοι ψάλλοντα. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἔψαλλεν ὁ
ψάλλων, καὶ ἐγένετο ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν χεὶρ Κυρίου, καὶ εἶπε· τάδε λέγει
**16** Κύριος· ποιήσατε τὸν χειμάρρουν τοῦτον βοθύνους βοθύνους. Ὅτι
τάδε λέγει Κύριος· οὐκ ὄψεσθε πνεῦμα, καὶ οὐκ ὄψεσθε ὑετὸν· καὶ ὁ
**17** χειμάρρους οὗτος πλησθήσεται ὕδατος, καὶ πίετε ὑμεῖς, καὶ αἱ
κτήσεις ὑμῶν, καὶ τὰ κτήνη ὑμῶν. Καὶ κούφη αὕτη ἐν ὀφθαλ-
**18** μοῖς Κυρίου· καὶ παραδώσω τὴν Μωὰβ ἐν χειρὶ ὑμῶν καὶ πα-
**19** τάξετε πᾶσαν τὴν πόλιν ὀχυρὰν, καὶ πᾶσαν πόλιν ἐκλεκτὴν, καὶ
πᾶν ξύλον ἀγαθὸν καταβαλεῖτε, καὶ πάσας πηγὰς ὕδατος ἐμφρά-
ξετε, καὶ πᾶσαν μερίδα ἀγαθὴν ἀχρειώσετε ἐν λίθοις.
**20** Καὶ ἐγένετο πρωῒ ἀναβαινούσης τῆς θυσίας, καὶ ἰδοὺ ὕδατα ἤρχοντο ἐξ ὁδοῦ
Ἐδώμ, καὶ ἐπλήσθη ἡ γῆ ὕδατος.
**21** Καὶ πᾶσα Μωὰβ ἤκουσαν ὅτι
ἀνέβησαν οἱ βασιλεῖς πολεμεῖν αὐτούς. Καὶ ἀνεβόησαν ἐκ παντὸς
περιεζωσμένοι ζώνην, καὶ ἐπάνω· καὶ ἔστησαν ἐπὶ τοῦ ὁρίου, καὶ
**22** ὤρθρισαν τοπρωῒ, καὶ ὁ ἥλιος ἀνέτειλεν ἐπὶ τὰ ὕδατα· καὶ ἴδε
**23** Μωὰβ ἐξεναντίας τὰ ὕδατα πυῤῥὰ ὡσεὶ αἷμα, καὶ εἶπον· αἷμα
τοῦτο τῆς ῥομφαίας· ἐμαχέσαντο οἱ βασιλεῖς, καὶ ἐπάταξαν ἀνὴρ
**24** τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ. καὶ νῦν ἐπὶ τὰ σκῦλα, Μωάβ. Καὶ εἰσῆλθον
εἰς τὴν παρεμβολὴν Ἰσραήλ. καὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἀνέστησαν, καὶ ἐπάτα-
ξαν τὴν Μωὰβ· καὶ ἔφυγον ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτῶν. Καὶ εἰσῆλθον
**25** εἰσπορευόμενοι, καὶ τύπτοντες τὴν Μωάβ, καὶ τὰς πόλεις κα-
θεῖλον· καὶ πᾶσαν μερίδα ἀγαθὴν, ἔῤῥιψαν ἀνὴρ τὸν λίθον, καὶ
ἐνέπλησαν αὐτήν· καὶ πᾶσαν πηγὴν ὕδατος ἐνέφραξαν, καὶ πᾶν
ξύλον ἀγαθὸν κατέβαλον, ἕως τοῦ καταλείπειν τοὺς λίθους τοῦ
τοίχου καθηρημένους· καὶ ἐκύκλωσαν οἱ σφενδονισταί, καὶ ἐπάτα-
**26** ξαν αὐτήν. Καὶ ἴδεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Μωὰβ ὅτι ἐκραταίωσεν ὑπὲρ
αὐτὸν ὁ πόλεμος, καὶ ἔλαβε μεθ᾽ αὑτοῦ ἑπτακοσίους ἄνδρας ἐσπασμέ-
νους ῥομφαίαν, διακόψαι πρὸς βασιλέα Ἐδώμ· καὶ οὐκ ἠδυνήθησαν.
**27** Καὶ ἔλαβε τὸν υἱὸν αὑτοῦ τὸν πρωτότοκον, ὃς ἐβασίλευσεν ἀντ᾿
αὑτοῦ, καὶ ἀνήνεγκεν αὐτὸν ὁλοκαύτωμα ἐπὶ τοῦ τείχους· καὶ
ἐγένετο μεταμελος μέγας ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ. καὶ ἀπῆραν ἀπ᾽ αὐτοῦ, καὶ
ὑπέστρεφαν εἰς τὴν γῆν.

of Hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, if I had not regard for the person of Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, I would not even look upon thee, nor see thee.
**15** And now, bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the Lord came upon him, and he said, "Thus saith the Lord:
**16** Make this wadi [full of] many ditches. For thus saith the Lord: Ye shall not see wind, nor shall ye see rain; yet this wadi shall be filled with water, and ye shall drink,
**17** and your possessions, and your cattle. And this is but a light thing in the sight of the Lord;
**18** and I will deliver Moab into your hand.
**19** And ye shall smite every fortified city, and every chosen city; and ye shall fell every good tree, and stop up all springs of water, and ruin every good parcel of land with stones."
**20** And it came to pass in the morning, at the time of the [offering of the] sacrifice, that, behold, waters came from the way of Edom, and the land was filled with water.
**21** And all Moab heard that the kings were come up to fight against them. And they cried out, all that were able to gird themselves [with a sword], and [even] those above [that age], and they stood upon the border;
**22** and they rose early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the waters;
**23** and behold, the Moabites saw the waters opposite them, red as blood. And they said, "This is blood of the sword! The kings have surely fought among themselves, and every man hath smitten his neighbor.
**24** Now therefore, O Moab, to the spoil!" So they came into the camp of Israel. And Israel rose up, and smote Moab; and they fled from before them. And they [Israel] entered,
**25** [even] going forward and smiting Moab, and they overthrew the cities; and on every good parcel of land, every man cast his stone, and filled it; and they stopped up every spring of water, and felled every good tree, until they left the stones of the walls broken down. And the slingers surrounded it, and smote it.
**26** And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too strong for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through unto the king of Edom; but they could not.
**27** Then he took his eldest son, who should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was great remorse upon Israel; and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.
