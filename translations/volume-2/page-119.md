ΚΕΦ. ΚΔʹ. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Βʹ. 595
μῆνας φεύγειν σε ἔμπροσθεν τῶν ἐχθρῶν σου, καὶ ἔσονται διώκοντές σε, ἢ γενέσθαι τρεῖς ἡμέρας θάνατον ἐν τῇ γῇ σου· νῦν οὖν γνῶθι, καὶ ἴδε τί ἀποκριθῶ τῷ ἀποστείλαντί με ῥῆμα. Καὶ εἶπε 14 Δαυὶδ πρὸς Γάδ· στενά μοι πάντοθεν σφόδρα ἐστίν· ἐμπεσοῦμαι δὴ ἐν χειρὶ Κυρίου, ὅτι πολλοὶ οἱ οἰκτιρμοὶ αὐτοῦ σφόδρα· εἰς δὲ χεῖρας ἀνθρώπου οὐ μὴ ἐμπέσω. Καὶ ἐξελέξατο 15 Δαυὶδ ἑαυτῷ τὸν θάνατον. Καὶ ἡμέραι θερισμοῦ πυρῶν, καὶ ἔδωκε Κύριος ἐν Ἰσραὴλ θάνατον ἀπὸ πρωΐθεν ἕως ὥρας ἀρίστου, καὶ ἤρξατο ἡ θραῦσις ἐν τῷ λαῷ· καὶ ἀπέθανεν ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ ἀπὸ Δὰν καὶ ἕως Βηρσαβεέ, ἑβδομήκοντα χιλιάδες ἀνδρῶν. Καὶ ἐξέτεινεν 16 ὁ ἄγγελος τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ τοῦ διαφθεῖραι αὐτήν, καὶ παρεκλήθη Κύριος ἐπὶ τῇ κακίᾳ, καὶ εἶπε τῷ ἀγγέλῳ τῷ διαφθείροντι ἐν τῷ λαῷ· πολὺ νῦν, ἄνες τὴν χεῖρά σου. Καὶ ὁ ἄγγελος Κυρίου ἦν παρὰ τῇ ἅλῳ Ὀρνὰ τοῦ Ἱεβουσαίου. Καὶ εἶπε Δαυὶδ πρὸς Κύριον ἐν τῷ ἰδεῖν αὐτὸν τὸν ἄγγελον τὸν 17 τύπτοντα ἐν τῷ λαῷ, καὶ εἶπεν· Ἰδοὺ ἐγώ εἰμι ἠδίκησα, καὶ ἐγὼ ὁ ποιμὴν ἐκακοποίησα, καὶ οὗτοι τὰ πρόβατα τί ἐποίησαν; γενέσθω δὴ ἡ χείρ σου ἐν ἐμοί, καὶ ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ πατρός μου. Καὶ 18 ἦλθε Γὰδ πρὸς Δαυὶδ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· ἀνάβηθι, καὶ στῆσον τῷ Κυρίῳ θυσιαστήριον ἐν τῇ ἅλωνι Ὀρνὰ τοῦ Ἱεβουσαίου. Καὶ ἀνέβη Δαυὶδ κατὰ τὸν λόγον Γάδ, καθ’ ὃν τρόπον 19 ἐνετείλατο αὐτῷ Κύριος. Καὶ διέκυψεν Ὀρνά, καὶ εἶδε τὸν 20 βασιλέα καὶ τοὺς παῖδας αὐτοῦ παραπορευομένους ἐπάνω αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Ὀρνά, καὶ προσεκύνησε τῷ βασιλεῖ ἐπὶ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν. Καὶ εἶπεν Ὀρνά· τί ὅτι ἦλθεν ὁ κύριός μου 21 ὁ βασιλεὺς πρὸς τὸν δοῦλον αὐτοῦ; καὶ εἶπε Δαυὶδ· κτήσασθαι παρὰ σοῦ τὴν ἅλωνα τοῦ οἰκοδομῆσαι θυσιαστήριον τῷ Κυρίῳ, καὶ συσχεθῇ ἡ θραῦσις ἐπάνω τοῦ λαοῦ. Καὶ εἶπεν Ὀρνὰ πρὸς Δαυίδ· 22 Λαβέτω καὶ ἀνενεγκάτω ὁ κύριός μου ὁ βασιλεὺς τῷ Κυρίῳ τὸ ἀγαθὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτοῦ· ἰδοὺ οἱ βόες εἰς ὁλοκαυτώματα, καὶ οἱ τροχοί, καὶ τὰ σκεύη τῶν βοῶν εἰς ξύλα. Τὰ πάντα ἔδωκεν 23 Ὀρνὰ τῷ βασιλεῖ. Καὶ εἶπεν Ὀρνὰ πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα· Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου εὐλογήσαι σε. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς πρὸς Ὀρνά· οὐχί, 24 ἔτι κτώμενος κτήσομαι παρὰ σοῦ ἐν ἀλλάγματι, καὶ οὐκ ἀνοίσω τῷ Κυρίῳ Θεῷ μου ὁλοκαύτωμα δωρεάν. Καὶ ἐκτήσατο Δαυὶδ τὴν ἅλω καὶ τοὺς βόας ἐν ἀργυρίῳ σίκλων πεντήκοντα.

**English Translation:**

13 months for thee to flee before thine enemies, and they shall pursue thee; or else there be three days of death in thy land. Now therefore know thou, and see what I shall answer unto Him that sent me with this word.”
14 And David said unto Gad, “Exceeding great are my straits on every side. Let me now fall into the hand of the Lord, for His mercies are very many; but into the hands of man shall I not fall.”
15 And David chose for himself the death [plague]. And it was in the days of wheat harvest that the Lord gave death in Israel, from the morning even until the hour of the midday meal; and the destruction began among the people. And there died of the people, from Dan even unto Beersheba, seventy thousand men.
16 And the angel stretched forth his hand towards Jerusalem to destroy it; and the Lord was entreated concerning the affliction, and He said unto the angel that destroyed among the people, “It is enough now; stay thy hand.” And the angel of the Lord was by the threshingfloor of Orna the Jebusite.
17 And David spoke unto the Lord, when he saw the angel that smote the people, and he said, “Behold, I am he that hath sinned, and I, the shepherd, have done wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? Let Thy hand, I pray, be upon me and upon the house of my father.”
18 And Gad came unto David on that day, and said unto him, “Go up, and set up for the Lord an altar in the threshingfloor of Orna the Jebusite.”
19 And David went up according to the word of Gad, even as the Lord had commanded him.
20 And Orna looked down, and saw the king and his servants passing over toward him.
21 And Orna went out, and bowed himself to the king with his face to the ground. And Orna said, “Why is it that my lord the king is come unto his servant?” And David said, “To purchase from thee the threshingfloor, that I may build an altar unto the Lord, and that the plague may be stayed from the people.”
22 And Orna said unto David, “Let my lord the king take and offer up unto the Lord that which is good in his eyes. Behold, the oxen are for burnt offerings, and the threshing sledges, and the implements of the oxen for wood.”
23 All these things did Orna give unto the king. And Orna said unto the king, “The Lord thy God bless thee.”
24 And the king said unto Orna, “Nay, but I will surely purchase it of thee for a price, and I will not offer burnt offerings unto the Lord my God for naught.” So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.
