τούτῳ, καὶ εὐδοκήσῃς, καὶ λαλήσῃς αὐτοῖς λόγους ἀγαθοὺς, καὶ 7
ἔσονται σοι παῖδες πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας. Καὶ κατέλιπε τὴν βουλὴν 8
τῶν πρεσβυτέρων, οἳ συνεβουλεύσαντο αὐτῷ· καὶ συνεβουλεύσατο
μετὰ τῶν παιδαρίων τῶν συνεκτραφέντων μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ τῶν ἑστηκότων
ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· τί ὑμεῖς βουλεύεσθε, καὶ 9
ἀποκριθήσομαι τῷ λαῷ τούτῳ λόγον, οἳ ἐλάλησαν πρὸς μὲ, λέγοντες·
ἄνες ἀπὸ τοῦ ζυγοῦ οὗ ἔδωκεν ὁ πατήρ σου ἐφ᾿ ἡμᾶς; Καὶ 10
ἐλάλησαν αὐτῷ τὰ παιδάρια τὰ ἐκτραφέντα μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, λέγοντες·
οὕτως λαλήσεις τῷ λαῷ τῷ λαλήσαντι πρὸς σὲ, λέγων, ὁ πατήρ
σου ἐβάρυνε τὸν ζυγὸν ἡμῶν, καὶ σὺ ἄφες ἀφ᾿ ἡμῶν, οὕτως ἐρεῖς·
ὁ μικρὸς δάκτυλός μου παχύτερος τῆς ὀσφύος τοῦ πατρός μου.
Καὶ νῦν ὁ πατήρ μου ἐπαίδευσεν ὑμᾶς ζυγῷ βαρεῖ, καὶ ἐγὼ προσθήσω 11
ἐπὶ τὸν ζυγὸν ὑμῶν· ὁ πατήρ μου ἐπαίδευσεν ὑμᾶς ἐν μάστιξι,
καὶ ἐγὼ παιδεύσω ὑμᾶς ἐν σκορπίοις. Καὶ ἦλθεν Ἱεροβοὰμ καὶ 12
πᾶς ὁ λαὸς πρὸς Ῥοβοὰμ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τρίτῃ, ὡς ἐλάλησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς,
λέγων, ἐπιστρέψατε πρὸς μὲ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τρίτῃ. Καὶ 13
ἀπεκρίθη ὁ βασιλεὺς σκληρὰ, καὶ ἐγκατέλιπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ῥοβοὰμ
τὴν βουλὴν τῶν πρεσβυτέρων, καὶ ἐλάλησε πρὸς αὐτοὺς κατὰ τὴν 14
βουλὴν τῶν νεωτέρων, λέγων· ὁ πατήρ μου ἐβάρυνε τὸν ζυγὸν ὑμῶν,
κἀγὼ προσθήσω ἐπ᾿ αὐτόν· ὁ πατήρ μου ἐπαίδευσεν ὑμᾶς ἐν
μάστιξι, καὶ ἐγὼ παιδεύσω ὑμᾶς ἐν σκορπίοις. Καὶ οὐκ ἤκουσεν 15
ὁ βασιλεὺς τοῦ λαοῦ, ὅτι ἦν μεταστροφὴ παρὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ, λέγων·
ἀνέστησε Κύριος τὸν λόγον αὐτοῦ, ὃν ἐλάλησεν ἐν χειρὶ Ἀχίᾳ τοῦ
Σηλωνίτου περὶ Ἱεροβοὰμ υἱοῦ Ναβὰτ, καὶ παντὸς Ἰσραὴλ, ὅτι 16
οὐκ ἤκουσεν ὁ βασιλεὺς αὐτῶν· καὶ ἀπεκρίθη ὁ λαὸς πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα,
λέγων· τίς ἡμῖν μερὶς ἐν Δαυίδ, καὶ κληρονομία ἐν υἱῷ Ἱεσσαί;
ἀπότρεχε εἰς τὰ σκηνώματά σου, Ἰσραὴλ, νῦν βλέπε τὸν οἶκόν
σου, Δαυίδ. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ εἰς τὰ σκηνώματα αὐτοῦ, 17
καὶ ἄνδρες Ἰσραὴλ οἱ κατοικοῦντες ἐν πόλεσιν Ἰούδα, καὶ
ἐβασίλευσαν ἐφ᾿ ἑαυτῶν τὸν Ῥοβοάμ. Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ὁ βασιλεὺς 18
Ῥοβοὰμ τὸν Ἀδωρὰμ τὸν ἐπὶ τοῦ φόρου, καὶ ἐλιθοβόλησαν αὐτὸν
οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ λίθοις, καὶ ἀπέθανε· καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς Ῥοβοὰμ ἔσπευσε
τοῦ ἀναβῆναι εἰς τὸ ἅρμα, τοῦ φυγείν εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ ἠθέτησεν 19
Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ Δαυὶδ ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης.

**Chapter 10**

7 to this people, and please them, and speak unto them good words, then they shall be your servants all the days [of your life].

8 But he forsook the counsel of the elders, who had advised him; and he took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him.

9 And he said unto them, "What counsel do you give, that I may answer this people a word, who have spoken unto me, saying:

10 'Ease [us] from the yoke which your father did lay upon us?'" And the young men who had grown up with him spoke unto him, saying, "Thus shall you speak unto the people who spoke unto you, saying, 'Your father made our yoke grievous, and you, do you ease [it] from us.' Thus shall you say: 'My little finger is thicker than my father's loins.

11 And now, my father did chastise you with a heavy yoke, but I will add to your yoke; my father did chastise you with scourges, but I will chastise you with scorpions.'"

12 So Jeroboam and all the people came unto Rehoboam on the third day, as the king had spoken, saying: "Return you unto me on the third day."

13 And the king answered them harshly, for King Rehoboam had forsaken the counsel of the elders,

14 and spoke unto them according to the counsel of the younger men, saying, "My father made your yoke grievous, but I will add to it; my father did chastise you with scourges, but I will chastise you with scorpions."

15 And the king hearkened not unto the people; for the turning away was from God, that the Lord might fulfill His word, which He had spoken by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and all Israel; for the king hearkened not unto them.

16 And the people answered the king, saying, "What portion have we in David? and [what] inheritance in the son of Jesse? Get you to your tents, O Israel; now see to your own house, O David!"

17 So all Israel departed unto their tents; but the men of Israel who dwelt in the cities of Judah, they made Rehoboam king over themselves.

18 Then King Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and the sons of Israel stoned him with stones, and he died. And King Rehoboam made haste to mount his chariot, to flee unto Jerusalem.

19 And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.
