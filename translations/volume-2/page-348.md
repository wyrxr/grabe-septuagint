ἐπὶ βασιλέα Ἰούδα τὸν ἀποστείλαντα ὑμᾶς τοῦ ζητῆσαι τὸν Κύριον, οὕτως ἐρεῖτε αὐτῷ· οὕτως λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ·
27 τοὺς λόγους οὓς ἤκουσας, καὶ ἐνετράπη ἡ καρδία σου, καὶ ἐταπεινώθης ἀπὸ προσώπου μου ἐν τῷ ἀκοῦσαί σε τοὺς λόγους μου ἐπὶ τὸν τόπον τοῦτον, καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας αὐτόν, καὶ ἐταπεινώθης ἐναντίον ἐμοῦ, καὶ διέρρηξας τὰ ἱμάτιά σου, καὶ ἔκλαυσας
28 κατεναντίον ἐμοῦ, καὶ ἐγὼ ἤκουσα, φησὶ Κύριος. Ἰδοὺ προστίθημί σε πρὸς τοὺς πατέρας σου, καὶ προστεθήσῃ πρὸς τὰ μνήματά σου ἐν εἰρήνῃ, καὶ οὐκ ὄψονται οἱ ὀφθαλμοί σου ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς κακοῖς οἷς ἐγὼ ἐπάγω ἐπὶ τὸν τόπον τοῦτον, καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας
29 αὐτόν. Καὶ ἀπέδωκαν τῷ βασιλεῖ λόγον· καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ὁ βασιλεύς, καὶ συνήγαγε τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους Ἰούδα καὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ.
30 Καὶ ἀνέβη ὁ βασιλεύς Ἰούδα εἰς οἶκον Κυρίου, καὶ πᾶς Ἰούδα, καὶ οἱ κατοικοῦντες Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς καὶ οἱ Λευῖται, καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ἀπὸ μεγάλου ἕως μικροῦ, καὶ ἀνέγνω ἐν ὠσὶν αὐτῶν πάντας λόγους βιβλίου τῆς διαθήκης τοῦ εὑρεθέντος ἐν οἴκῳ
31 Κυρίου. Καὶ ἔστη ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐπὶ τὸν στύλον, καὶ διέθετο διαθήκην ἐναντίον Κυρίου, τοῦ πορευθῆναι ἐνώπιον Κυρίου, τοῦ φυλάσσειν τὰς ἐντολὰς αὐτοῦ, καὶ μαρτύρια αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰ προστάγματα αὐτοῦ ἐν ὅλῃ καρδίᾳ, καὶ ἐν ὅλῃ ψυχῇ, ὥς τε ποιεῖν τοὺς λόγους
32 τῆς διαθήκης τοὺς ἐγγεγραμμένους ἐπὶ τῷ βιβλίῳ τούτῳ. Καὶ ἔστησε πάντας τοὺς εὑρεθέντας ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ καὶ Βενιαμείν, καὶ ἐποίησαν οἱ κατοικοῦντες εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ διαθήκην ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου
33 Θεοῦ πατέρων ἑαυτῶν. Καὶ περιεῖλεν Ἰωσίας τὰ πάντα βδελύγματα ἐκ πάσης τῆς γῆς, ἧς ἦν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐποίησε πάντας τοὺς εὑρεθέντας ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ καὶ ἐν Ἰσραήλ, τοῦ δουλεύειν Κυρίῳ Θεῷ ἑαυτῶν πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας ἑαυτοῦ, οὐκ ἐξέκλινεν ἀπὸ ὄπισθεν Κυρίου Θεοῦ πατέρων ἑαυτοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. ΛΕʹ. XXXV.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐποίησεν Ἰωσίας τὸ Φασὲκ τῷ Κυρίῳ Θεῷ ἑαυτοῦ, καὶ ἔθυσαν τὸ Φασὲκ τῇ τεσσαρεσκαιδεκάτῃ τοῦ μηνὸς τοῦ πρώτου.
2 Καὶ ἔστησε τοὺς ἱερεῖς ἐπὶ τὰς φυλακὰς ἑαυτῶν, καὶ κατίσχυσεν αὐτοὺς εἰς τὰ ἔργα οἴκου Κυρίου.
3 Καὶ εἶπε τοῖς Λευίταις τοῖς δυνατοῖς ἐν παντὶ Ἰσραήλ, τοῦ ἁγιασθῆναι αὐτοὺς τῷ Κυρίῳ. καὶ

**Chapter 34 [continued]**

...unto the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, thus shall ye say unto him: 'Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel:
²⁷ "Because of the words which thou hast heard, and because thy heart was humbled, and thou wast brought low before My presence, when thou didst hear My words concerning this place, and concerning its inhabitants; and thou wast humbled before Me, and didst rend thy garments, and didst weep
²⁸ before Me, and I have heard it," saith the LORD. "Behold, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered unto thy graves in peace; and thine eyes shall not see all the evils which I will bring upon this place, and upon its inhabitants."'"
²⁹ And they brought back word unto the king. And the king sent, and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
³⁰ And the king of Judah went up into the House of the LORD, and all Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, from the great even unto the small; and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the House
³¹ of the LORD. And the king stood by the pillar, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk before the LORD, to keep His commandments, and His testimonies, and His statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, so as to perform the words
³² of the covenant which were written in this book. And he caused all them that were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand [to it]; and the inhabitants of Jerusalem made a covenant in the House of the LORD,
³³ [even with] the God of their fathers. And Josiah removed all the abominations out of all the land which was of the children of Israel, and made all that were found in Jerusalem and in Israel to serve the LORD their God all his days. He turned not aside from following the LORD God of his fathers.

**Chapter 35**

¹ And Josiah kept the Passover unto the LORD his God; and they sacrificed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.
² And he set the priests in their watches, and strengthened them for the service of the House of the LORD.
³ And he spake unto the Levites, who were able in all Israel, to sanctify themselves unto the LORD. And
