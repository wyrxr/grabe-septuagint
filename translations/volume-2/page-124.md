42 τῆς κερατίνης, καὶ εἶπε· τίς ἡ φωνὴ τῆς πόλεως ἠχούσης; Ἔτι
αὐτοῦ λαλοῦντος, καὶ ἰδοὺ Ἰωνάθαν υἱὸς Ἀβιάθαρ τοῦ ἱερέως ἦλθε·
καὶ εἶπε Ἀδωνίας, εἴσελθε, ὅτι ἀνὴρ δυνάμεως εἶ σύ, καὶ ἀγαθὰ
43 εὐαγγελίσαι. Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Ἰωνάθαν, καὶ εἶπε τῷ Ἀδωνίᾳ·
44 καὶ μάλα ὁ κύριος ἡμῶν ὁ βασιλεὺς Δαυὶδ ἐβασίλευσε τὸν Σαλωμών,
καὶ ἀπέστειλε μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ὁ βασιλεὺς τὸν Σαδὼκ τὸν ἱερέα, καὶ
τὸν Νάθαν τὸν προφήτην, καὶ Βαναίαν υἱὸν Ἰωιαδαέ, καὶ τὸν Χερεθεί,
45 καὶ τὸν Φελεθεί, καὶ ἐπεκάθισαν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὴν ἡμίονον τοῦ βασιλέως.
Καὶ ἔχρισαν αὐτὸν Σαδὼκ ὁ ἱερεὺς καὶ Νάθαν ὁ προφήτης εἰς
βασιλέα ἐν τῷ Γιῶν, καὶ ἀνέβησαν ἐκεῖθεν εὐφραινόμενοι, καὶ ἤχησεν
ἡ πόλις. Αὕτη ἡ φωνὴ ἣν ἠκούσατε.
46 Καὶ ἐκάθισε Σαλωμὼν ἐπὶ θρόνου τῆς βασιλείας.
47 Καὶ εἰσῆλθον οἱ δοῦλοι τοῦ βασιλέως εὐλογῆσαι τὸν κύριον ἡμῶν
τὸν βασιλέα Δαυίδ, λέγοντες· ἀγαθύναί ὁ Θεὸς τὸ ὄνομα Σαλωμὼν
τοῦ υἱοῦ σου ὑπὲρ τὸ ὄνομά σου, καὶ μεγαλύναι τὸν θρόνον αὐτοῦ
ὑπὲρ τὸν θρόνον σου. Καὶ προσεκύνησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐπὶ τὴν κοίτην αὐτοῦ.
48 Καὶ γε οὕτως εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεύς· εὐλογητὸς Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ,
ὃς ἔδωκέ (μοι) σήμερον ἐκ τοῦ σπέρματός μου καθήμενον
49 ἐπὶ τοῦ θρόνου μου, καὶ οἱ ὀφθαλμοί μου βλέπουσι. Καὶ ἐξέστησαν,
καὶ ἐξανέστησαν πάντες οἱ κλητοὶ τοῦ Ἀδωνίου, καὶ ἀπῆλθον ἀνὴρ
50 εἰς τὴν ὁδὸν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ Ἀδωνίας ἐφοβήθη ἀπὸ προσώπου Σαλωμών,
καὶ ἀνέστη, καὶ ἀπῆλθε, καὶ ἐπελάβετο τῶν κεράτων τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου.
51 Καὶ ἀνηγγέλη τῷ Σαλωμών, λέγοντες· ἰδοὺ Ἀδωνίας ἐφοβήθη τὸν
βασιλέα Σαλωμών, καὶ κατέχει τῶν κεράτων τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου, λέγων·
ὀμοσάτω μοι σήμερον ὁ βασιλεὺς Σαλωμών,
52 εἰ οὐ θανατώσει τὸν δοῦλον αὐτοῦ ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ. Καὶ εἶπε Σαλωμών·
ἐὰν γένηται εἰς υἱὸν δυνάμεως, οὐ πεσεῖται τῶν τριχῶν αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν
γῆν· καὶ ἐὰν κακία εὑρεθῇ ἐν αὐτῷ, θανατωθήσεται.
53 Καὶ ἀπέστειλε Σαλωμὼν ὁ βασιλεύς, καὶ κατήνεγκαν αὐτόν
ἐπάνωθεν τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου. Καὶ εἰσῆλθε, καὶ προσεκύνησε τῷ βασιλεῖ
Σαλωμών. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Σαλωμών· δεῦρο εἰς τὸν οἶκόν σου.

### A Royal Translation of the Third Book of Kingdoms, Chapter 1

**42** of the trumpet, and said, "What is this noise of the city, that resoundeth so?" And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest did come; and Adonijah said, "Come in, for thou art a man of might, and good tidings shalt thou bring."
**43** And Jonathan answered and said unto Adonijah:
**44** "Yea, verily, our lord King David hath made Solomon king; and the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and
**45** the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and they made him ride upon the king's mule. And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet did anoint him king in Gihon; and they came up from thence rejoicing, and the city did ring. This is the sound which ye have heard.
**46** And Solomon is now seated upon the throne of the kingdom."
**47** And the king's servants also came in to bless our lord King David, saying, "May God make the name of Solomon thy son more excellent than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne!" And the king bowed himself upon his bed.
**48** And moreover the king also said thus: "Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, Who hath given [unto me] this day one from my seed to sit
**49** upon my throne, and mine eyes behold it." And all the invited guests of Adonijah were dismayed, and did rise up, and went, each man his way.
**50** And Adonijah feared before the face of Solomon; and he arose, and went, and laid hold upon the horns of the altar.
**51** And it was reported unto Solomon, saying, "Behold, Adonijah feareth King Solomon, and hath laid hold upon the horns of the altar, saying, 'Let King Solomon swear unto me this day,'
**52** 'if he will not slay his servant with the sword.'" And Solomon said, "If he shall prove himself a worthy man, not one hair of his head shall fall to the ground; but if wickedness be found in him, he shall surely die."
**53** So King Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came in, and did obeisance to King Solomon; and Solomon said unto him, "Get thee unto thine house."

**1** Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying:
