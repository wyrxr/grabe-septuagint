Ἡνὰν, Μαλούχ, Ἡρὰμ, Βαανὰ, καὶ οἱ κατάλοιποι τοῦ λαοῦ, οἱ 27.28
ἱερεῖς, καὶ οἱ Λευῖται, οἱ πυλωροὶ, οἱ ᾄδοντες, οἱ Ναθινεὶμ, καὶ
πᾶς ὁ προσπορευόμενος ἀπὸ λαῶν τῆς γῆς πρὸς τὸν νόμον τοῦ
Θεοῦ, γυναῖκες αὐτῶν, υἱοὶ αὐτῶν, θυγατέρες αὐτῶν. πᾶς δ᾽ εἰδὼς
καὶ συνιῶν, ἐνίσχυον ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς ἑαυτῶν, καὶ κατηράσαντο 29
αὐτοὺς, καὶ εἰσήλθοσαν ἐν ἀρᾷ καὶ ἐν ὅρκῳ τοῦ πορεύεσθαι ἐν νόμῳ
τοῦ Θεοῦ, ὃς ἐδόθη ἐν χειρὶ Μωϋσῆ δούλου τοῦ Θεοῦ, φυλάσ-
σεσθαι καὶ ποιεῖν πάσας τὰς ἐντολὰς Κυρίου, καὶ κρίματα αὐτοῦ,
καὶ τὰ προστάγματα αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοῦ μὴ δοῦναι θυγατέρας ἡμῶν 30
τοῖς λαοῖς τῆς γῆς, καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας αὐτῶν οὐ ληψόμεθα τοῖς
υἱοῖς ἡμῶν. Καὶ λαοὶ τῆς γῆς οἱ φέροντες τοὺς ἀγορασμοὺς καὶ 31
πᾶσαν πρᾶσιν ἐν ἡμέρᾳ τοῦ σαββάτου ἀποδόσθαι, οὐκ ἀγορῶμεν
παρ᾽ αὐτῶν ἐν σαββάτῳ καὶ ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ἁγίᾳ. καὶ ἀνήσομεν τὸ ἔτος
τὸ ἕβδομον, καὶ ἀπαίτησιν πάσης χειρός. Καὶ στήσομεν ἐφ᾽ ἡμᾶς 32
ἐντολὰς δοῦναι ἐφ᾽ ἡμᾶς τρίτον τοῦ διδράχμου κατ᾽ ἐνιαυτὸν εἰς
δουλείαν οἴκου τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν, εἰς ἄρτους τοῦ προσώπου, καὶ θυ- 33
σίαν τοῦ ἐνδελεχισμοῦ, καὶ εἰς ὁλοκαύτωμα τοῦ ἐνδελεχισμοῦ τῶν
σαββάτων, τῶν νουμηνιῶν, εἰς τὰς ἑορτὰς καὶ εἰς τὰ ἅγια, καὶ τὰ
περὶ ἁμαρτίας, ἐξιλάσασθαι περὶ Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ εἰς ἔργα οἴκου τοῦ
Θεοῦ ἡμῶν. Καὶ κλήρους ἐβάλομεν περὶ κλήρου ξυλοφορίας, οἱ 34
ἱερεῖς καὶ οἱ Λευῖται καὶ ὁ λαὸς, ἐνέγκαι εἰς οἶκον Θεοῦ ἡμῶν, εἰς
οἶκον πατριῶν ἡμῶν, εἰς καιροὺς ἀπὸ χρόνων, ἐνιαυτὸν κατ᾽ ἐνιαυτόν,
ἐκκαῦσαι ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον Κυρίου Θεοῦ ἡμῶν ὡς γέγρα-
πται ἐν τῷ νόμῳ· καὶ ἐνέγκαι τὰ πρωτογεννήματα τῆς γῆς ἡμῶν, 35
καὶ πρωτογεννήματα καρποῦ παντὸς ξύλου ἐνιαυτὸν κατ᾽ ἐνιαυτὸν
εἰς οἶκον Κυρίου, καὶ τὰ πρωτότοκα υἱῶν ἡμῶν καὶ κτηνῶν ἡμῶν, 36
ὡς γέγραπται ἐν τῷ νόμῳ, καὶ τὰ πρωτότοκα τῶν βοῶν ἡμῶν καὶ
ποιμνίων ἡμῶν ἐνέγκαι εἰς οἶκον Θεοῦ ἡμῶν, τοῖς ἱερεῦσι τοῖς λει-
τουργοῦσιν ἐν οἴκῳ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν. Καὶ τὴν ἀπαρχὴν σίτων ἡμῶν, 37
καὶ τὸν καρπὸν παντὸς ξύλου, οἴνου καὶ ἐλαίου, οἴσομεν τοῖς ἱερεῦ-
σιν εἰς τὸ γαζοφυλάκιον οἴκου τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ δεκάτην γῆς ἡμῶν
τοῖς Λευίταις. καὶ αὐτοὶ οἱ Λευῖται δεκατοῦντες ἐν πάσαις πόλε-
σι δουλείας ἡμῶν. Καὶ ἔσται ὁ ἱερεὺς υἱὸς Ἀαρὼν μετὰ τοῦ Λευί- 38
του ἐν τῇ δεκάτῃ τοῦ Λευίτου, καὶ οἱ Λευῖται ἀνοίσουσι τὴν δεκά-
την τῆς δεκάτης εἰς οἶκον Θεοῦ ἡμῶν, εἰς τὰ γαζοφυλάκια, εἰς
οἶκον τοῦ Θεοῦ. Ὅτι εἰς τοὺς θησαυροὺς εἰσοίσουσιν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ 39

δούλων Σαλωμών.

Φαδαΐα, υἱὸς Κωλείᾳ, υἱὸς Μαασίου, υἱὸς Ἡθὴλ, υἱὸς Ἰεσσεία,
8 καὶ ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ Γηβεεὶ, Σηλεί, ἐννακόσιοι εἰκοσιοκτώ.
9 Καὶ Ἰωὴλ υἱὸς Ζεχρὶ ἐπίσκοπος ἐπ᾿ αὐτούς. καὶ Ἰούδας υἱὸς
Ἀσανὰ ἀπὸ τῆς πόλεως, δεύτερος ἀπὸ τῶν ἱερέων.

#### NEHEMIAH CHAPTER 10

<sup>27</sup> Hanan, Malluch, Harim, Baanah,
and the rest of the people:
the priests, and the Levites, the gatekeepers,
the singers, the Nethinim,
<sup>28</sup> and all they who had separated themselves
from the peoples of the lands
unto the Law of God,
their wives, their sons, their daughters;
<sup>29</sup> every one that had knowledge and understanding,
they clave unto their brethren,
and called down a curse upon themselves,
and entered into a curse and into an oath,
to walk in the Law of God,
which was given by the hand of Moses,
the servant of God,
to observe and to do all the commandments of the Lord,
and His judgments, and His statutes;
<sup>30</sup> And that we would not give our daughters
unto the peoples of the land,
nor take their daughters for our sons;
<sup>31</sup> And if the peoples of the land should bring wares
or any manner of merchandise to sell on the Sabbath day,
we would not buy it of them
on the Sabbath or on the holy day.
And we will leave off [the exacting for] the seventh year,
and the demanding of every debt.
<sup>32</sup> Also we have made ordinances for us,
to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a didrachma
for the service of the house of our God;
<sup>33</sup> For the showbread,
and for the continual sacrifice,
and for the continual burnt offering,
for the Sabbaths, for the new moons,
for the set feasts, and for the holy things,
and for the sin offerings to make an atonement for Israel,
and for all the work of the house of our God.
<sup>34</sup> And we cast lots among the priests,
the Levites, and the people,
concerning the wood offering,
to bring it into the house of our God,
after the houses of our fathers,
at appointed times, year by year,
to burn upon the altar of the Lord our God,
as it is written in the Law;
<sup>35</sup> And to bring the firstfruits of our ground,
and the firstfruits of the fruit of every tree,
year by year, unto the house of the Lord;
<sup>36</sup> And the firstborn of our sons, and of our cattle,
as it is written in the Law;
and the firstborn of our oxen and of our flocks,
to bring to the house of our God,
unto the priests who minister in the house of our God;
<sup>37</sup> And the firstfruits of our grain,
and the fruit of every tree, of wine and of oil,
we will bring unto the priests
into the treasury of the house of God;
and the tithes of our ground unto the Levites;
and they themselves, the Levites,
shall receive tithes in all the cities of our service.
<sup>38</sup> And the priest, the son of Aaron,
shall be with the Levite when the Levite takes tithes;
and the Levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes
unto the house of our God,
to the treasuries, into the house of God.
<sup>39</sup> For the children of Israel and the children of Levi
shall bring the firstfruits of the grain,
and of the wine, and of the oil, unto the storerooms;
and there are the holy vessels,
and the ministering priests, and the gatekeepers,
and the singers: and we will not forsake
the house of the Lord our God.
