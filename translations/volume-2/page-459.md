νών. Ἦν δὲ αὐτὸς πατρὸς μὲν Ζαρὲθ, τῶν υἱῶν Ἠσαῦ υἱὸς, μητρὸς δὲ Βοσσόρας· ὥστε εἶναι αὐτὸν πέμπτον ἀπὸ Ἀβραάμ. Καὶ οὗτοι οἱ βασιλεῖς οἱ βασιλεύσαντες ἐν Ἐδώμ, ἧς καὶ αὐτὸς ἦρξε χώρας· πρῶτος Βαλὰκ ὁ τοῦ Βεὼρ, καὶ ὄνομα τῇ πόλει αὐτοῦ Δενναβά· μετὰ δὲ Βαλὰκ Ἰωβὰβ, ὁ καλούμενος Ἰώβ. Μετὰ δὲ τοῦτον Ἀσσὼμ ὁ ὑπάρχων ἡγεμὼν ἐκ τῆς Θαιμανίτιδος χώρας· μετὰ δὲ τοῦτον Ἀδὰδ, υἱὸς Βαρὰδ, ὁ ἐκκόψας Μαδιὰμ ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ Μωάβ· καὶ ὄνομα τῇ πόλει αὐτοῦ Γεθαίμ. Οἱ δὲ ἐλθόντες πρὸς αὐτὸν φίλοι, Ἐλιφὰζ (υἱὸς Σωφᾶν) τῶν υἱῶν Ἠσαῦ, Θαιμανῶν βασιλεὺς, Βαλδὰδ (υἱὸς Ἄμνων τοῦ Χοβὰρ) ὁ Σαυχαίων τύραννος, Σωφὰρ ὁ Μιναίων βασιλεύς. (Θαιμὰν υἱὸς Ἐλιφὰζ, ἡγεμὼν τῆς Ἰδουμαίας· οὗτος ἑρμηνεύεται ἐκ τῆς Συριακῆς βίβλου, ἐν μὲν γῇ κατοικῶν τῇ Αὐσίτιδι, ἐπὶ τῶν ὁρίων τοῦ Εὐφράτου· προϋπῆρχε δὲ τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ἰωβὰβ· ἦν δὲ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ Ζαρὲθ, ἐξ ἀνατολῶν ἡλίου.)

## CHAPTER XLII.

...**Ennon.** And he himself was born of his father Zareth, a son of the sons of Esau, and his mother was Bossora; so that he was the fifth from Abraham.

And these are the kings that reigned in Edom, of which land he himself also did rule: the first was Balak the son of Beor, and the name of his city was Dennaba. And after Balak, [came] Jobab, who is called Job.

And after him, Assom, who was a ruler from the land of the Temanites. And after him, Adad, the son of Barad, who cut off Midian in the plain of Moab; and the name of his city was Gethaim.

Now the friends that came unto him were Eliphaz (the son of Sophan) of the sons of Esau, king of the Temanites; and Baldad (the son of Ammon, of Khobar), the tyrant of the Shuhites; and Sophar, the king of the Minæans.

(Teman, [who was] the son of Eliphaz, [was] ruler of Idumaea. This [account] is interpreted from the Syriac book, [stating that Job] dwelt in the land of Ausitis, upon the borders of the Euphrates. And his former name was Jobab; and his father was Zareth, from the rising of the sun.)
