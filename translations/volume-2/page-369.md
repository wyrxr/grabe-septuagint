¹ νίσκοι, ὅτι ἔκλαυσαν ὁ λαός, καὶ ὕψωσε κλαίων. Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη
² Σεχενίας υἱὸς Ἰειὴλ ἀπὸ υἱῶν Ἡλάμ, καὶ εἶπε τῷ Ἔζρα· ἡμεῖς
   ἠσυνθετήσαμεν τῷ Θεῷ ἡμῶν, καὶ ἐκαθίσαμεν γυναῖκας ἀλλοτρίας
   ἀπὸ λαῶν τῆς γῆς· καὶ νῦν ἐστιν ὑπομονὴ τῷ Ἰσραὴλ ἐπὶ τούτῳ·
³ καὶ νῦν διαθώμεθα διαθήκην τῷ Θεῷ ἡμῶν ἐκβαλεῖν πάσας τὰς
   γυναῖκας, καὶ τὰ γενόμενα ἐξ αὐτῶν, ὡς ἂν βούλῃ. ἀνάστηθι, καὶ
   φοβέρισον αὐτοὺς ἐν ἐντολαῖς Θεοῦ ἡμῶν, καὶ ὡς ὁ νόμος, γενηθήτω·
⁴ ἀνάστηθι, ὅτι ἐπὶ σὲ τὸ ῥῆμα, καὶ ἡμεῖς μετὰ σοῦ· κραταιοῦ
   καὶ ποίησον.
⁵ Καὶ ἀνέστη Ἔζρας, καὶ ὥρκισε τοὺς ἄρχοντας, τοὺς
   ἱερεῖς καὶ Λευίτας καὶ πάντα Ἰσραήλ, τοῦ ποιῆσαι κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα
   τοῦτο· καὶ ὤμοσαν.
⁶ Καὶ ἀνέστη Ἔζρας ἀπὸ προσώπου οἴκου τοῦ
   Θεοῦ, καὶ ἐπορεύθη εἰς γαζοφυλάκιον Ἰωναν υἱοῦ Ἐλισούβ, καὶ
   ἐπορεύθη ἐκεῖ· ἄρτον οὐκ ἔφαγε, καὶ ὕδωρ οὐκ ἔπιεν, ὅτι ἐπένθει
   ἐπὶ τῇ ἀσυνθεσίᾳ τῆς ἀποικεσίας.
⁷ Καὶ παρήνεγκαν φωνὴν ἐν Ἰούδᾳ
   καὶ ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ πᾶσι τοῖς υἱοῖς τῆς ἀποικίας, τοῦ συναθροισθῆναι
   εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ.
⁸ Πᾶς ὃς ἂν μὴ ἔλθῃ εἰς τρεῖς ἡμέρας, ὡς
   ἂν ἡ βουλὴ τῶν ἀρχόντων καὶ τῶν πρεσβυτέρων, ἀναθεματισθήσεται
   πᾶσα ἡ ὕπαρξις αὐτοῦ, καὶ αὐτὸς διασταλήσεται ἀπὸ ἐκκλησίας
   τῆς ἀποικίας.
⁹ Καὶ συνήχθησαν πάντες ἄνδρες Ἰούδα καὶ Βενιαμεὶν
   εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ εἰς τὰς τρεῖς ἡμέρας. οὗτος ὁ μὴν ὁ ἔνατος·
   ἐν εἰκάδι τοῦ μηνὸς ἐκάθισε πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ἐν πλατείᾳ οἴκου τοῦ Θεοῦ
   ἀπὸ τοῦ θορύβου αὐτῶν περὶ τοῦ ῥήματος καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ χειμῶνος.
¹⁰ Καὶ ἀνέστη Ἔζρας ὁ ἱερεύς, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτούς· ὑμεῖς ἠσυνθετήκατε,
   καὶ ἐκαθίσατε γυναῖκας ἀλλοτρίας τοῦ προσθεῖναι ἐπὶ πλημμέλειαν
   Ἰσραήλ.
¹¹ Καὶ νῦν δότε αἴνεσιν τῷ Κυρίῳ Θεῷ τῶν πατέρων
   ἡμῶν, καὶ ποιήσατε τὸ ἀρεστὸν ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ, καὶ διαστάλητε
   ἀπὸ λαῶν τῆς γῆς καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν γυναικῶν τῶν ἀλλοτρίων.
¹² Καὶ ἀπεκρίθησαν πᾶσα ἡ ἐκκλησία, καὶ εἶπαν· μέγα τοῦτο τὸ ῥῆμα
   σου ἐφ᾿ ἡμᾶς ποιῆσαι·
¹³ ἀλλὰ ὁ λαὸς πολύς, καὶ ὁ καιρὸς χειμερινός,
   καὶ οὐκ ἔστι δύναμις στῆναι ἔξω· καὶ τὸ ἔργον οὐκ εἰς
   ἡμέραν μίαν καὶ οὐκ εἰς δύο, ὅτι ἐπληθύναμεν τοῦ ἀδικῆσαι ἐν τῷ
   ῥήματι τούτῳ.
¹⁴ Στήτωσαν δὴ οἱ ἄρχοντες ἡμῶν τῇ πάσῃ ἐκκλησίᾳ,
   καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς ἐν πόλεσιν ἡμῶν, ὃς ἐκάθισε γυναῖκας ἀλλοτρίας,
   ἐλθέτωσαν εἰς καιροὺς ἀπὸ συνταγῶν· καὶ μετ᾿ αὐτῶν πρεσβύτεροι
   πόλεως καὶ πόλεως, καὶ κριταί, τοῦ ἀποστρέψαι ὀργὴν θυμοῦ
   Θεοῦ ἡμῶν ἐξ ἡμῶν, περὶ τοῦ ῥήματος τούτου,
¹⁵ Πλὴν Ἰωνάθαν υἱὸς Ἀσαὴλ, καὶ Ἰαζίας υἱὸς Θεκοὺε μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ περὶ τούτου,

#### Chapter 10

¹ ...young men, for the people did weep, and [Ezra] lifted up [his voice] weeping.
² Then Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, of the sons of Elam,
   answered and said unto Ezra, "We have dealt faithlessly with our God,
   and have taken foreign women from the peoples of the land;
   yet now there is hope for Israel concerning this matter.
³ Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God
   to put away all these women, and those that are born of them,
   according to thy counsel. Arise, and warn them by the commandments
   of our God, and let it be done according to the Law.
⁴ Arise, for this matter resteth upon thee,
   and we are with thee: be strong, and do it."
⁵ Then Ezra arose, and made the chiefs, the priests,
   the Levites, and all Israel to swear that they would do
   according to this word; and they swore.
⁶ And Ezra arose from before the House of God,
   and went into the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib;
   and he went there, and did eat no bread, nor drink water,
   for he mourned because of the faithlessness of them that were returned from exile.
⁷ And they made a proclamation throughout Judah
   and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity,
   that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem.
⁸ And whosoever should not come within three days,
   according to the counsel of the princes and the elders,
   all his substance should be forfeited, and himself should be separated
   from the congregation of the captivity.
⁹ Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together
   unto Jerusalem within three days. It was the ninth month,
   on the twentieth day of the month; and all the people sat
   in the broad place before the House of God,
   because of their clamor concerning the matter and because of the winter rain.
¹⁰ And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them,
   "Ye have acted faithlessly, and have taken foreign women,
   to increase the trespass of Israel.
¹¹ Now therefore give praise unto the Lord God of your fathers,
   and do His pleasure, and separate yourselves
   from the peoples of the land, and from the foreign women."
¹² Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice,
   "Great is this matter of thine for us to perform.
¹³ But the people are many, and the season is winter,
   and we are not able to stand without;
   neither is this a work of one day or two,
   for we have greatly transgressed in this matter.
¹⁴ Let now our princes stand for all the congregation,
   and let all them in our cities, who have taken foreign wives,
   come at appointed times by agreement; and with them let the elders
   and judges of every city assist, to turn away
   the fierce wrath of our God from us, concerning this matter."
¹⁵ Notwithstanding, Jonathan the son of Asahel, and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah,
   were with me concerning this matter,
