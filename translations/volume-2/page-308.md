ΚΕΦ. ΙΑʹ. ΧΙ.

¹⁹ Ἰεσσαί. Καὶ ἔτεκεν αὐτῷ υἱούς, τὸν Ἰεούς, καὶ τὸν Σαμαρίαν,
²⁰ καὶ τὸν Ζαάμ. Καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα ἔλαβεν ἑαυτῷ τὴν Μααχὰ θυγατέρα Ἀβεσσαλώμ· καὶ ἔτεκεν αὐτῷ τὸν Ἀβιά, καὶ τὸν Ζιζά,
²¹ καὶ τὸν Σαλημώθ. Καὶ ἠγάπησε Ῥοβοὰμ τὴν Μααχὰ θυγατέρα Ἀβεσσαλὼμ ὑπὲρ πάσας τὰς γυναῖκας αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰς παλλακὰς αὐτοῦ, ὅτι γυναῖκας δεκαοκτὼ εἶχε, καὶ παλλακὰς ἑξήκοντα· καὶ ἐγέννησεν υἱοὺς εἴκοσι καὶ ὀκτώ, καὶ θυγατέρας ἑξήκοντα.
²² Καὶ κατέστησεν εἰς ἄρχοντα Ῥοβοὰμ τὸν Ἀβιὰ τὸν τῆς Μααχά, εἰς ἡγούμενον ἐν τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς αὐτοῦ, ὅτι βασιλεῦσαι διενοεῖτο αὐτόν.
²³ Καὶ ηὐξήθη παρὰ πάντας τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς ὁρίοις Ἰούδα καὶ Βενιαμίν, καὶ ἐν ταῖς πόλεσι ταῖς ὀχυραῖς, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐταῖς τροφὰς πλῆθος πολύ, καὶ ἠτήσατο πλῆθος γυναικῶν.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΒʹ. ΧΙΙ.

¹ ΚΑὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἡτοιμάσθη ἡ βασιλεία Ῥοβοάμ, καὶ ὡς κατεκρατήθη, ἐγκατέλειπε τὰς ἐντολὰς Κυρίου, καὶ πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ.
² Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ πέμπτῳ ἔτει τῆς βασιλείας Ῥοβοάμ, ἀνέβη Σουσακεὶμ βασιλεὺς Αἰγύπτου ἐπὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ, ὅτι ἥμαρτον ἐναντίον Κυρίου,
³ ἐν χιλίοις καὶ διακοσίοις ἅρμασι καὶ ἑξήκοντα χιλιάσιν ἵππων, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἀριθμὸς τοῦ πλήθους τοῦ ἐλθόντος μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἐξ Αἰγύπτου, Λίβυες, Τρωγλοδῦται, καὶ Αἰθίοπες,
⁴ καὶ κατεκράτησαν τῶν πόλεων τῶν ὀχυρῶν αἵ ἦσαν ἐν Ἰούδα, καὶ
⁵ ἦλθον εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ Σαμαίας ὁ προφήτης ἦλθε πρὸς Ῥοβοάμ, καὶ πρὸς τοὺς ἄρχοντας Ἰούδα τοὺς συναχθέντας εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἀπὸ προσώπου Σουσακείμ, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· οὕτως εἶπε Κύριος· ὑμεῖς ἐγκαταλείπατέ με, κἀγὼ ἐγκαταλείψω ὑμᾶς ἐν χειρὶ Σουσακείμ.
⁶ Καὶ ἠισχύνθησαν οἱ ἄρχοντες Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ὁ βασιλεύς, καὶ εἶπαν· δίκαιος ὁ Κύριος.
⁷ Καὶ ἐν τῷ ἰδεῖν Κύριον ὅτι ἐνετράπησαν, καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς Σαμαίαν, λέγων· ἐνετράπησαν, οὐ καταφθερῶ αὐτούς, καὶ δώσω αὐτοὺς ὡς μικρὸν εἰς σωτηρίαν,
⁸ καὶ οὐ μὴ στάξῃ ὁ θυμός μου ἐπὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ, ὅτι ἔσονται εἰς παῖδας, καὶ γνώσονται τὴν δουλείαν μου, καὶ τὴν δουλείαν τῆς βασιλείας τῆς γῆς.
⁹ Καὶ ἀνέβη Σουσακεὶμ βασιλεὺς Αἰγύπτου ἐπὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἔλαβε τοὺς θησαυροὺς τοὺς ἐν οἴκῳ

²² And Rehoboam appointed Abijah, the son of Maacah, to be chief, [even] ruler among his brethren; for he intended to make him king.
²³ And he advanced him above all his sons in all the borders of Judah and Benjamin, and in the fortified cities; and he gave them abundant provisions, and he sought a multitude of wives.

¹ And it came to pass, when the kingdom of Rehoboam was established, and when it was made strong, that he forsook the commandments of the Lord, and all Israel with him.
² And it came to pass in the fifth year of King Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had sinned against the Lord,
³ with a thousand and two hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen; and there was no number to the multitude that came with him out of Egypt: Libyans, Troglodytes, and Ethiopians.
⁴ And they took possession of the fortified cities which were in Judah, and
⁵ came unto Jerusalem. And Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, "Thus saith the Lord: Ye have forsaken Me, and I also will forsake you into the hand of Shishak."
⁶ And the princes of Israel, and the king, were ashamed, and they said, "The Lord is righteous."
⁷ And when the Lord saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah, saying, "They have humbled themselves; I will not destroy them, but I will give them [a little] salvation,
⁸ and My wrath shall not pour out upon Jerusalem; for they shall be [as] servants, and they shall know My servitude, and the servitude of the kingdoms of the earth."
