¹¹ δὴ, Κύριε· ἀλλ᾿ ἔστω τὸ οὖς σου προσέχον εἰς τὴν προσευχὴν τοῦ
δούλου σου, καὶ εἰς τὴν προσευχὴν παίδων σου τῶν θελόντων φο-
βεῖσθαι τὸ ὄνομά σου. καὶ εὐόδωσον δὴ τῷ παιδί σου σήμερον, καὶ
δὸς αὐτὸν εἰς οἰκτιρμοὺς ἐνώπιον τοῦ ἀνδρὸς τούτου. Κἀγὼ ἤμην
οἰνοχόος τῷ βασιλεῖ.

ΚΕΦ. Β'. II.
¹ ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο ἐν μηνὶ Νεισὰν ἔτους εἰκοσοῦ ᾿Αρθασασθὰ βα-
σιλεῖ, καὶ ἦν ὁ οἶνος ἐνώπιον ἐμοῦ· καὶ ἔλαβον τὸν οἶνον, καὶ ἔδω-
κα τῷ βασιλεῖ. ² καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἕτερος ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπέ μοι ὁ
βασιλεύς· διὰ τί τὸ πρόσωπόν σου πονηρόν, καὶ οὐκ εἰ μετριάζων;
οὐκ ἔστι τοῦτο, εἰ μὴ πονηρία καρδίας. ³ καὶ ἐφοβήθην πολὺ
σφόδρα, καὶ εἶπα τῷ βασιλεῖ· ὁ βασιλεὺς εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα ζήτω.
διὰ τί οὐ μὴ γένηται πονηρὸν τὸ πρόσωπόν μου, διότι ἡ πόλις,
οἶκος μνημείων πατέρων μου, ἠρημώθη, καὶ αἱ πύλαι αὐτῆς κατ-
εβρώθησαν ἐν πυρί; ⁴ Καὶ εἶπέ μοι ὁ βασιλεύς· περὶ τίνος τοῦτο
σὺ ζητεῖς; ⁵ καὶ προσηυξάμην πρὸς τὸν Θεὸν τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ εἶ-
πα τῷ βασιλεῖ· εἰ ἐπὶ τὸν βασιλέα ἀγαθὸν, καὶ εἰ ἀγαθυνθήσε-
ται ὁ παῖς σου ἐνώπιόν σου, ὥστε πέμψαι αὐτὸν εἰς ᾿Ιούδα εἰς
πόλιν μνημείων πατέρων μου, καὶ ἀνοικοδομήσω αὐτήν. ⁶ Καὶ εἶπέ
μοι ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ ἡ παλλακὴ ἡ καθημένη ἐχόμενα αὐτοῦ· ἕως
πότε ἔσται ἡ πορεία σου, καὶ πότε ἐπιστρέψεις; καὶ ἠγαθύνθη
ἐνώπιον τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ ἀπέστειλέ με, καὶ ἔδωκα αὐτῷ ὅρον.
⁷ Καὶ εἶπα τῷ βασιλεῖ· εἰ ἐπὶ τὸν βασιλέα ἀγαθὸν, δότω μοι ἐπι-
στολὰς πρὸς τοὺς ἐπάρχους πέραν τοῦ ποταμοῦ, ὥστε παραγαγεῖν
με ἕως ἔλθω ἐπὶ ᾿Ιούδαν, ⁸ καὶ ἐπιστολὴν ἐπὶ ᾿Ασὰφ φύλακα τοῦ
παραδείσου ὃς ἐστι τῷ βασιλεῖ, ὥστε δοῦναί μοι ξύλα στεγάσαι
τὰς πύλας, καὶ εἰς τὸ τεῖχος τῆς πόλεως, καὶ εἰς οἶκον ὃν εἰσ-
ελεύσομαι εἰς αὐτόν. Καὶ ἔδωκέ μοι ὁ βασιλεύς, ὡς χεὶρ Θεοῦ ἡ
ἀγαθή. ⁹ Καὶ ἦλθον πρὸς τοὺς ἐπάρχους πέραν τοῦ ποταμοῦ, καὶ
ἔδωκα αὐτοῖς τὰς ἐπιστολὰς τοῦ βασιλέως· καὶ ἀπέστειλε μετ᾿
ἐμοῦ ὁ βασιλεὺς ἀρχηγοὺς τῆς δυνάμεως καὶ ἱππεῖς. ¹⁰ Καὶ ἤκουσε
Σαναβαλλὰτ ὁ ᾿Αρωνὶ, καὶ Τωβία ὁ δοῦλος ᾿Αμμωνὶ, καὶ πονηρὸν
αὐτοῖς ἐγένετο, ὅτι ἥκει ἄνθρωπος ζητῆσαι ἀγαθὸν τοῖς υἱοῖς ᾿Ισ-
ραήλ. ¹¹ Καὶ ἦλθον εἰς ῾Ιερουσαλὴμ, καὶ ἤμην ἐκεῖ ἡμέρας τρεῖς.

Now, O Lord, I beseech thee; but let thine ear be attentive unto the prayer of thy servant, and unto the prayer of thy servants who desire to fear thy name. And grant now prosperity unto thy servant this day, and give him [to find] favor in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cupbearer.

CHAPTER II.

¹ And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that the wine was before me; and I took the wine, and gave it unto the king. ² And there was none other before him. And the king said unto me, "Wherefore is thy countenance sad, and art thou not well? This is nothing, save only sorrow of heart." ³ Then I was very sore afraid, and said unto the king, "Let the king live for ever! Why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the house of my fathers' sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?" ⁴ Then the king said unto me, "For what dost thou make request?" And I prayed to the God of heaven. ⁵ And I said unto the king, "If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favor in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may build it." ⁶ And the king said unto me, and the concubine that sat by him, "How long shall thy journey be? And when wilt thou return?" So it pleased the king [to send me], and he sent me; and I appointed him a time. ⁷ Moreover I said unto the king, "If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me through until I come into Judah; ⁸ and a letter unto Asaph, the keeper of the king's paradise, that he may give me timber to roof the gates, and for the wall of the city, and for the house which I shall enter into." And the king granted me [all this], according to the good hand of God upon me. ⁹ Then came I to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me. ¹⁰ And when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the Ammonite servant, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel. ¹¹ So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.
