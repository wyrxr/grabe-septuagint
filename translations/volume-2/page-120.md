25 Καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν ἐκεῖ Δαυΐδ θυσιαστήριον τῷ Κυρίῳ· καὶ ἀνήνεγκεν ὁλοκαυτώσεις καὶ εἰρηνικάς. Καὶ προσέθηκε Σαλωμὼν ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον ἐπ᾿ ἐσχάτῳ, ὅτι μικρὸν ἦν ἐν πρώτοις. Καὶ ἐπήκουσε Κύριος τῇ γῇ, καὶ συνεσχέθη ἡ θραῦσις ἐπάνωθεν ᾿Ισραήλ.

25 And David built there an altar unto the Lord, and offered up burnt offerings and peace offerings. And Solomon added unto the altar at the last, for it was small at first. And the Lord hearkened unto the land, and the plague was stayed from upon Israel.
