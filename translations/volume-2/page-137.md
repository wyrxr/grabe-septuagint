**36** τάτην τρεῖς στίχους ἀπελεκήτων, καὶ στίχος κατειργασμένης κέδρου.
**37** Ἐν τῷ ἔτει τῷ τετάρτῳ ἐθεμελίωσε τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου ἐν μηνὶ Ζειοὺ, καὶ τῷ δευτέρῳ μηνί.
**38** Ἐν ἑνδεκάτῳ ἐνιαυτῷ ἐν μηνὶ Βοὺλ, οὗτος ὁ μὴν ὄγδοος· συνετελέσθη ὁ οἶκος εἰς πάντα λόγον αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἰς πᾶσαν διάταξιν αὐτοῦ· καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν αὐτὸν ἐν ἑπτὰ ἔτεσιν.

**1** ΚΑὶ τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ ᾠκοδόμησε Σαλωμὼν τρισκαίδεκα ἔτεσι.
**2** καὶ συνετέλεσεν ὅλον τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ᾠκοδόμησε τὸν οἶκον δρυμοῦ τοῦ Λιβάνου, ἑκατὸν πήχεις τὸ μῆκος αὐτοῦ, καὶ πεντήκοντα πήχεις πλάτος αὐτοῦ, καὶ τριάκοντα πηχῶν ὕψος αὐτοῦ· καὶ τριῶν στίχων στύλων κεδρίνων, καὶ ὑπομίαι κέδριναι τοῖς στύλοις.
**3** Καὶ ἐφάτνωσε τὸν οἶκον ἄνωθεν ἐπὶ τῶν πλευρῶν τῶν στύλων·
**4** καὶ ἀριθμὸς τῶν στύλων τεσσαράκοντα καὶ πέντε. Δέκα καὶ πέντε ὁ στίχος, καὶ μέλαθρα τρία, καὶ χῶρα ἐπὶ χώραν τρισσῶς.
**5** Καὶ πάντα τὰ θυρώματα, καὶ αἱ χῶραι τετράγωνοι μεμελαθρωμέναι· καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ θυρώματος ἐπὶ θύραν τρισσῶς.
**6** Καὶ τὸ αἰλὰμ τῶν στύλων ἐποίησε πεντήκοντα πηχῶν μῆκος, καὶ τριάκοντα ἐν πλάτει ἐξυγωμένα, αἰλὰμ ἐπὶ πρόσωπον αὐτῶν· καὶ στύλοι καὶ πάγος ἐπὶ πρόσωπον αὐτῶν τοῖς ἐλαμμείμ.
**7** Καὶ τὸ αἰλὰμ τῶν θρόνων οὗ κρινεῖ ἐκεῖ, τὸ αἰλὰμ τοῦ κριτηρίου ἐποίησε, καὶ ὡρόφωσεν ἐν κέδρῳ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἐδάφους ἕως τοῦ ἐδάφους.
**8** Καὶ οἶκος αὐτῷ ἐν ᾧ καθήσεται ἐκεῖ, αὐλὴ μία ἐξελισσομένη τούτοις κατὰ τὸ ἔργον τοῦτο· καὶ οἶκον τῇ θυγατρὶ Φαραὼ ἣν ἔλαβε Σαλωμὼν, κατὰ τὸ αἰλὰμ τοῦτο.
**9** Πάντα ταῦτα ἐκ λίθων τιμίων μέτρων ἀπελεκήτων κεκολαμμένα ἐκ διαστήματος ἔσωθεν, καὶ ἔξωθεν, καὶ ἐκ τοῦ θεμελίου ἕως τῶν γεισῶν.
**10** Καὶ ἔξωθεν εἰς τὴν αὐλὴν τὴν μεγάλην τὴν τεθεμελιωμένην τιμίοις λίθοις μεγάλοις, λίθοις δεκαπήχεις καὶ τοῖς ὀκταπήχεις.
**11** Καὶ ἐπάνωθεν λίθοις τιμίοις κατὰ τὸ μέτρον ἀπελεκήτων, καὶ κέδροις.
**12** Τῆς αὐλῆς τῆς μεγάλης κύκλῳ τρεῖς στίχοι ἀπελεκήτων, καὶ στίχος κεκολαμμένης κέδρου· καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν αὐλὴν οἴκου τὴν ἐσωτάτην τοῦ αἰλὰμ τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ ναοῦ.
**13** Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Σαλωμὼν, καὶ ἔλαβε τὸν Χειρὰμ ἐκ Τύρου,

**2** and he finished all his house. And he built the House of the Forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits; with three rows of cedar pillars, and cedar cross-beams upon the pillars.
**3** And he planked the house above upon the sides of the pillars;
**4** and the number of the pillars was forty and five. Fifteen [were] in a row, and three beams, and story upon story in three [tiers].
**5** And all the windows, and the chambers were square, framed with beams; and from window to window, threefold.
**6** And he made the porch of pillars, the length thereof fifty cubits, and in breadth thirty [cubits], projecting; a porch before them; and pillars and a thick beam before them, for the doorposts.
**7** And he made the porch of thrones where he would judge there, [even] the porch of judgment; and he roofed it with cedar from the floor unto the floor.
**8** And there was a house for him wherein he might dwell there, one court enclosed for these works after this manner; and a house for Pharaoh's daughter, whom Solomon had taken [to wife], like unto this porch.
**9** All these [buildings were made] of precious stones, of hewn stones of [exact] measure, carved at intervals within and without, and from the foundation even unto the cornices.
**10** And outside, for the great court which was founded with great precious stones, even stones of ten cubits and those of eight cubits.
**11** And above [were] precious stones according to the measure of hewn stones, and cedars.
**12** For the great court round about there were three rows of hewn stones, and a row of carved cedar; and he built the inner court of the house, of the porch of the house which was before the temple.
**13** And King Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre,
