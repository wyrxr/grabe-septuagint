¹⁰ μου ἀπέστειλε τὸν λαὸν εἰς τὰ σκηνώματα αὐτῶν εὐφραινομένους, καὶ ἀγαθῇ καρδίᾳ ἐπὶ τοῖς ἀγαθοῖς οἷς ἐποίησε Κύριος τῷ Δαυΐδ, καὶ τῷ Σαλωμὼν καὶ τῷ Ἰσραὴλ λαῷ αὐτοῦ.
¹¹ Καὶ συνετέλεσε Σαλωμὼν τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου, καὶ τὸν οἶκον τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἠθέλησεν ἐν τῇ ψυχῇ Σαλωμὼν τοῦ ποιῆσαι ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου καὶ ἐν οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ, εὐωδώθη.
¹² Καὶ ὤφθη Κύριος τῷ Σαλωμὼν τὴν νύκτα, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· ἤκουσα τῆς προσευχῆς σου, καὶ ἐξελεξάμην ἐν τῷ τόπῳ τούτῳ ἐμαυτῷ εἰς οἶκον θυσίας.
¹³ Ἐὰν συσχῶ τὸν οὐρανόν, καὶ μὴ γένηται ὑετός, καὶ ἐὰν ἐντείλωμαι τῇ ἀκρίδι καταφαγεῖν τὸ ξύλον, καὶ ἐὰν ἀποστείλω θάνατον ἐν τῷ λαῷ μου,
¹⁴ καὶ ἐὰν ἐντραπῇ ὁ λαός μου ἐφ᾿ οἷς τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐπικέκληται ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῖς, καὶ προσεύξωνται, καὶ ζητήσωσι τὸ πρόσωπόν μου, καὶ ἀποστρέψωσιν ἀπὸ τῶν ὁδῶν αὐτῶν τῶν πονηρῶν, καὶ ἐγὼ εἰσακούσομαι ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ ἵλεως ἔσομαι ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις αὐτῶν, καὶ ἰάσομαι τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν.
¹⁵ Νῦν οἱ ὀφθαλμοί μου ἔσονται ἀνεῳγμένοι, καὶ τὰ ὦτά μου ἐπήκοα τῇ προσευχῇ τοῦ τόπου τούτου·
¹⁶ καὶ νῦν ἐξελεξάμην καὶ ἡγίακα τὸν οἶκον τοῦτον, τοῦ εἶναι ὄνομά μου ἐκεῖ ἕως αἰῶνος, καὶ ἔσονται οἱ ὀφθαλμοί μου καὶ ἡ καρδία μου ἐκεῖ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας.
¹⁷ Καὶ σὺ ἐὰν πορευθῇς ἐναντίον μου ὡς Δαυΐδ ὁ πατήρ σου, καὶ ποιήσῃς κατὰ πάντα ἃ ἐνετειλάμην σοι, καὶ τὰ προστάγματά μου, καὶ τὰ κρίματά μου φυλάξῃς,
¹⁸ καὶ ἀναστήσω τὸν θρόνον τῆς βασιλείας σου, ὡς διεδέμην Δαυΐδ τῷ πατρί σου, λέγων, οὐκ ἐξαρθήσεταί σοι ἀνὴρ ἡγούμενος ἐν Ἰσραήλ.
¹⁹ Καὶ ἐὰν ἀποστρέψητε ὑμεῖς, καὶ ἐγκαταλίπητε τὰ προστάγματά μου, καὶ τὰς ἐντολάς μου ἃς ἔδωκα ἐναντίον ὑμῶν, καὶ πορευθῆτε, καὶ λατρεύσητε θεοῖς ἑτέροις, καὶ προσκυνήσητε αὐτοῖς,
²⁰ καὶ ἐξαρῶ ὑμᾶς ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς ἧς ἔδωκα αὐτοῖς· καὶ τὸν οἶκον τοῦτον ὃν ἡγίακα τῷ ὀνόματί μου ἀποστρέψω ἀπὸ προσώπου μου, καὶ δώσω αὐτὸν εἰς παραβολήν, καὶ εἰς διήγημα ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς ἔθνεσι.
²¹ Καὶ ὁ οἶκος οὗτος ὁ ὑψηλός, πᾶς ὁ διαπορευόμενος πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐκστήσεται, καὶ ἐρεῖ, χάριν τίνος ἐποίησε Κύριος τῇ γῇ ταύτῃ, καὶ τῷ οἴκῳ τούτῳ;
²² Καὶ ἐροῦσι· διότι ἐγκατέλιπον Κύριον τὸν Θεὸν τῶν πατέρων αὐτῶν, τὸν ἐξαγαγόντα αὐτοὺς ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, καὶ ἀντελάβοντο θεῶν ἑτέρων, καὶ προσεκύνησαν αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἐδούλευσαν αὐτοῖς, διὰ τοῦτο ἐπήγαγεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς πᾶσαν τὴν κακίαν ταύτην.

CHAPTER 7.

¹⁰ [Then] did he send the people away to their tents, rejoicing and with gladness of heart, for all the good that the Lord had wrought for David, and for Solomon, and for Israel His people.

¹¹ Thus Solomon brought to completion the House of the Lord, and the king's house; and whatsoever Solomon had desired in his soul to make in the House of the Lord, and in his own house, was brought to good effect.

¹² And the Lord appeared unto Solomon by night, and said unto him, "I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place for Myself to be a house of sacrifice.
¹³ If I shut up the heaven, and there be no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the vegetation, or if I send pestilence among My people;
¹⁴ if My people, which are called by My name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.
¹⁵ Now My eyes shall be open, and My ears attentive unto the prayer made in this place.
¹⁶ For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that My name may be there forever; and Mine eyes and My heart shall be there continually.

¹⁷ And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before Me as David thy father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and observe My statutes and My judgments;
¹⁸ then will I establish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I covenanted with David thy father, saying, 'There shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel.'
¹⁹ But if ye turn away, and forsake My statutes and My commandments, which I have set before you, and go and serve other gods, and worship them;
²⁰ then will I pluck you up from the land which I have given to them; and this house, which I have sanctified for My name, will I cast out from before My face, and will make it a proverb and a byword among all nations.
²¹ And this house, which was so high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall say, 'Wherefore hath the Lord done thus unto this land, and unto this house?'
²² And they shall answer, 'Because they forsook the Lord God of their fathers, Who brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath He brought upon them all this evil.'"
