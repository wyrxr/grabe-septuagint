τόπον οὗ ᾔδει ὅτι ἄνδρες δυνάμεως ἔχει. Καὶ ἐξῆλθον οἱ ἄνδρες 17
τῆς πόλεως, καὶ ἐπολέμουν μετὰ Ἰωάβ. Καὶ ἔπεσαν ἀπὸ τοῦ
λαοῦ ἐκ τῶν δούλων Δαυίδ, καὶ ἀπέθανε καὶ γε Οὐρίας ὁ Χετ-
ταῖος. Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ἰωὰβ καὶ ἀπήγγειλε τῷ Δαυίδ πάντας 18
τοὺς λόγους τοῦ πολέμου. Καὶ ἐνετείλατο τῷ ἀγγέλῳ, λέγων· ἐν 19
τῷ συντελέσαι πάντας τοὺς λόγους τοῦ πολέμου λαλῆσαι πρὸς
τὸν βασιλέα, καὶ ἔσται ἐὰν ἀναβῇ ὁ θυμὸς τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ 20
εἴπῃ σοι, τί ἠγγίσατε πρὸς τὴν πόλιν τοῦ πολεμῆσαι; οὐκ ᾔδειτε
ὅτι τοξεύουσιν ἀπάνωθεν τοῦ τείχους; τίς ἐπάταξε τὸν Ἀβιμέλεχ, 21
υἱὸν Ἰεροβάαλ υἱοῦ Νήρ; οὐχὶ γυνὴ ἐῤῥίφεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν κλάσμα μύ-
λου ἐπάνωθεν τοῦ τείχους, καὶ ἀπέθανεν ἐν Θαμασσεί; ἵνατί προσ-
ηγάγετε πρὸς τὸ τεῖχος; καὶ ἐρεῖς· καὶ γε Οὐρίας ὁ δοῦλός σου
ὁ Χετταῖος ἀπέθανε. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη ὁ ἄγγελος Ἰωὰβ πρὸς τὸν 22
βασιλέα εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ παρεγένετο, καὶ ἀπήγγειλε τῷ
Δαυίδ πάντα ὅσα ἀπήγγειλεν αὐτῷ Ἰωάβ, πάντα τὰ ῥήματα
τοῦ πολέμου. Καὶ ἐθυμώθη Δαυίδ πρὸς Ἰωάβ, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς τὸν 23
ἄγγελον· ἵνατί προσηγάγετε πρὸς τὴν πόλιν τοῦ πολεμῆσαι; οὐκ
ᾔδειτε ὅτι πληγήσεσθε ἀπὸ τοῦ τείχους; τίς ἐπάταξε τὸν Ἀβι-
μέλεχ υἱὸν Ἰεροβάαλ; οὐχὶ γυνὴ ἐῤῥίφεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν κλάσμα μύ-
λου ἀπὸ τοῦ τείχους, καὶ ἀπέθανεν ἐν Θαμασσεί; ἵνατί προση-
γάγετε πρὸς τὸ τεῖχος; Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ ἄγγελος πρὸς Δαυίδ· Ἔτι
ἐκραταίωσαν ἐφ᾿ ἡμᾶς οἱ ἄνδρες, καὶ ἐξῆλθαν πρὸς ἡμᾶς εἰς τὸν
ἀγρόν, καὶ ἐγενήθημεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς ἕως τῆς θύρας τῆς πύλης. Καὶ 24
ἐτόξευσαν οἱ τοξεύοντες πρὸς τοὺς παῖδάς σου ἀπάνωθεν τοῦ τεί-
χους, καὶ ἀπέθανον τῶν παίδων τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ γε Οὐρίας ὁ
δοῦλός σου ὁ Χετταῖος ἀπέθανε. Καὶ εἶπε Δαυίδ πρὸς τὸν ἄγγε- 25
λον· τάδε ἐρεῖς πρὸς Ἰωάβ· Μὴ πονηρὸν ἔστω ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς
σου τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο, ὅτι ποτὲ μὲν οὕτως καὶ ποτὲ οὕτως κατα-
φάγεται ἡ μάχαιρα· κραταίωσον τὸν πόλεμόν σου πρὸς τὴν πόλιν,
καὶ κατάσπασον αὐτήν, καὶ κραταίωσον αὐτόν. Καὶ ἤκουσεν ἡ γυ- 26
νὴ Οὐρίου ὅτι ἀπέθανεν Οὐρίας ὁ ἀνὴρ αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐκόψατο ἐπὶ τὸν
ἄνδρα αὐτῆς. Καὶ ἦλθε τὸ πένθος, καὶ ἀπέστειλε Δαυίδ, καὶ 27
συνήγαγεν αὐτὴν εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐγενήθη αὐτῷ γυναῖκα,
καὶ ἔτεκεν αὐτῷ υἱόν. Καὶ ἐφάνη πονηρὸν τὸ ῥῆμα, ὃ ἐποίησε
Δαυίδ ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς Κυρίου.)

### Chapter 11

**16** [he put him] in a place where he knew that there were valiant men.

**17** And the men of the city went out and fought with Joab. And there fell of the people, even of the servants of David, and Uriah the Hittite died also.

**18** Then Joab sent and reported unto David all the matters of the battle.

**19** And he charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast finished speaking all the words of the battle unto the king,

**20** and it shall be, if the king’s wrath rise up, and he say unto thee, “Why drew ye nigh unto the city to fight? Knew ye not that they shoot from above the wall?

**21** Who smote Abimelech, the son of Jerubaal, the son of Ner? Did not a woman cast upon him a piece of a millstone from above the wall, and he died in Thamassey? Why drew ye nigh unto the wall?” Then shalt thou say, “Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.”

**22** So the messenger of Joab went unto the king in Jerusalem, and when he arrived, he reported unto David all whatsoever Joab had told him, even all the words of the war.

**23** And David was wroth with Joab, and said unto the messenger, “Why drew ye nigh unto the city to fight? Knew ye not that ye should be smitten from the wall? Who smote Abimelech, the son of Jerubaal? Did not a woman cast upon him a piece of a millstone from the wall, and he died in Thamassey? Why drew ye nigh unto the wall?” And the messenger said unto David, “Moreover, the men prevailed against us, and came out against us into the open field, and we pursued them even unto the entrance of the gate.

**24** And the archers shot at thy servants from above the wall, and some of the king’s servants are dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.”

**25** Then David said unto the messenger, “Thus shalt thou say unto Joab, ‘Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth now one, and now another. Make thy battle strong against the city, and overthrow it; and strengthen thou [the siege].’”

**26** And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she lamented for her husband.

**27** And when the mourning was past, David sent and gathered her into his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. (But the thing that David had done was evil in the eyes of the Lord.)
