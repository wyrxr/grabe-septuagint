9 σε ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς εἰς βασιλέα τοῦ ποιῆσαι κρίσιν καὶ δικαιοσύνην. Καὶ
Ἔδωκε τῷ βασιλεῖ ἑκατὸν εἴκοσι τάλαντα χρυσίου, καὶ ἀρώματα
εἰς πλῆθος πολύ, καὶ λίθον τίμιον, καὶ οὐκ ἦν κατὰ τὰ ἀρώματα
10 ἐκεῖνα ἃ ἔδωκε βασίλισσα Σαβὰ τῷ βασιλεῖ Σαλωμών. Καὶ οἱ παῖ-
δες Σαλωμών, καὶ οἱ παῖδες Χειρὰμ ἔφερον χρυσίον τῷ Σαλωμὼν
11 ἐκ Σουφείρ, καὶ ξύλα πεύκινα, καὶ λίθον τίμιον. Καὶ ἐποίησεν ὁ
βασιλεὺς τὰ ξύλα τὰ πεύκινα ἀναβάσεις τῷ οἴκῳ Κυρίου, καὶ τῷ
οἴκῳ τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ κιθάρας καὶ νάβλας τοῖς ᾠδοῖς, καὶ οὐκ
12 ὤφθησαν τοιαῦτα ἔμπροσθεν ἐν γῇ Ἰούδα. Καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς Σα-
λωμὼν ἔδωκε τῇ βασιλίσσῃ Σαβὰ πάντα τὰ θελήματα αὐτῆς ἃ
ᾔτησεν, ἐκτὸς πάντων ὧν ἤνεγκε τῷ βασιλεῖ Σαλωμὼν, καὶ ἀπέστρεψεν
13 εἰς τὴν γῆν ἑαυτῆς. Καὶ ἦν ὁ σταθμὸς τοῦ χρυσίου τοῦ
ἐνεχθέντος τῷ Σαλωμὼν ἐν ἐνιαυτῷ ἑνί, ἑξακόσια ἑξηκονταὲξ τάλαντα
14 χρυσίου, πλὴν τῶν ἀνδρῶν τῶν ὑποτεταγμένων, καὶ τῶν
ἐμπορευομένων ὧν ἔφερον· καὶ πάντων τῶν βασιλέων τῆς Ἀρα-
βίας, καὶ σατραπῶν τῆς γῆς, ἔφερον χρυσίον καὶ ἀργύριον τῷ βασιλεῖ
15 Σαλωμών. Καὶ ἐποίησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Σαλωμὼν διακοσίους
θυρεοὺς χρυσοῦς ἐλατούς, ἑξακόσιοι χρυσοῖ καθαροὶ ἐπῆσαν ἐπὶ
16 τὸν ἕνα θυρεόν· καὶ τριακοσίας ἀσπίδας ἐλατὰς χρυσᾶς, τριακο-
σίων χρυσῶν ἀνεφέρετο ἐπὶ τὴν ἀσπίδα ἑκάστην, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὰς
17 ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐν οἴκῳ τοῦ δρυμοῦ τοῦ Λιβάνου. Καὶ ἐποίησεν ὁ
βασιλεὺς θρόνον ἐλεφαντίνων ὀδόντων μέγαν, καὶ κατεχρύσωσεν
18 αὐτὸν χρυσίῳ δοκίμῳ· καὶ ἓξ ἀναβαθμοὶ τῷ θρόνῳ ἐνδεδεμένοι
χρυσίῳ, καὶ ἀγκῶνες ἔνθεν καὶ ἔνθεν ἐπὶ τοῦ θρόνου τῆς καθέδρας,
19 καὶ δύο λέοντες ἑστηκότες παρὰ τοὺς ἀγκῶνας, καὶ δώδεκα λέον-
τες ἑστηκότες ἐκεῖ ἐπὶ τῶν ἓξ ἀναβαθμῶν ἔνθεν καὶ ἔνθεν· οὐκ
20 ἐγενήθη οὕτως ἐν πάσῃ βασιλείᾳ· καὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη τοῦ βασι-
λέως Σαλωμὼν χρυσίου, καὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη οἴκου δρυμοῦ τοῦ
Λιβάνου χρυσίῳ κατειλημμένα· καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἀργύριον λογιζόμενον ἐν
21 ἡμέραις Σαλωμὼν εἰς οὐθέν· ἔτι ναῦς τῷ βασιλεῖ Σαλωμὼν ἐπο-
ρεύετο εἰς Θαρσεῖς μετὰ τῶν παίδων Χειρὰμ, ἅπαξ διὰ τριῶν
ἐτῶν ἤρχετο πλοῖα ἐκ Θαρσεῖς τῷ βασιλεῖ γέμοντα χρυσίου καὶ
22 ἀργυρίου, καὶ ὀδόντων ἐλεφαντίνων, καὶ πιθήκων. Καὶ ἐμεγαλύν-
θη Σαλωμὼν ὑπὲρ πάντας τοὺς βασιλεῖς, καὶ πλούτῳ, καὶ σοφίᾳ.
23 Καὶ πάντες οἱ βασιλεῖς τῆς γῆς ἐζήτουν τὸ πρόσωπον Σαλωμὼν
ἀκοῦσαι τῆς σοφίας αὐτοῦ, ἧς ἔδωκεν ὁ Θεὸς ἐν καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ.

9 thee over them as king, to execute judgment and righteousness. And she gave to the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices in very great abundance, and precious stone; and there were no such spices
10 like those which the Queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon. And the servants of Solomon, and the servants of Hiram, brought gold to Solomon
11 from Ophir, and pine wood, and precious stone. And the king made of the pine wood terraces for the house of the LORD, and for the king's house, and harps and psalteries for the singers; and such things
12 had not been seen before in the land of Judah. And King Solomon gave to the Queen of Sheba all her desires which she asked, besides all that which she brought to King Solomon; and she turned back
13 to her own land. And the weight of the gold that was brought to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six
14 talents of gold, besides that which the subordinate men brought, and of the merchants [which they brought]; and all the kings of Arabia, and the satraps of the land, brought gold and silver to King
15 Solomon. And King Solomon made two hundred shields of beaten gold; six hundred [shekels of] pure gold went into
16 one shield; and three hundred shields of beaten gold, three hundred [shekels] of gold were brought upon each shield; and the king placed them
17 in the house of the forest of Lebanon. Moreover, the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid
18 it with fine gold; and six steps to the throne, bound with gold, and armrests on either side of the seat of the throne,
19 and two lions standing by the armrests, and twelve lions standing there upon the six steps, on either side; such a throne was not
20 made in any kingdom. And all the vessels of King Solomon were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were covered with gold; and silver was not accounted of in
21 the days of Solomon for anything [of value]. Moreover, the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Hiram; once every three
years came the ships from Tarshish to the king, laden with gold, and silver,
22 and ivory, and apes. So King Solomon exceeded all the kings [of the earth] in wealth and in wisdom.
23 And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.
