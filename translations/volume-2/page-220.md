ΚΕΦ. ΙΖʹ. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Δʹ. 696
29 Κύριον. Καὶ ἦσαν ποιοῦντες ἔθνη ἔθνη θεοὺς αὐτῶν· καὶ ἔθηκαν
    ἐν οἴκῳ τῶν ὑψηλῶν ὧν ἐποίησαν οἱ Σαμαρεῖται, ἔθνη ἔθνη ἐν
30 ταῖς πόλεσιν αὐτῶν, ἐν αἷς αὐτοὶ κατῴκουν ἐν αὐταῖς. Καὶ οἱ
    ἄνδρες Βαβυλῶνος ἐποίησαν τὴν Συχχὼθ Βενιθί, καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες
    Χοὺθ ἐποίησαν τὴν Νεργέλ, καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες Αἱμὰθ ἐποίησαν τὴν
31 Ἀσιμάθ, καὶ οἱ Εὐαῖοι ἐποίησαν τὴν Ναβαζαέρ, καὶ τὴν Ναιβάς,
    καὶ τὴν Θαρδάχ, καὶ οἱ Σεφφαρουαὶμ (ἡνίκα) κατέκαιον τοὺς υἱοὺς
    αὐτῶν ἐν πυρὶ τῷ Ἀδραμέλεχ, καὶ Ἀνημελέχ, θεοῖς Σεφφαρουαίμ.
32 Καὶ ἦσαν φοβούμενοι τὸν Κύριον· καὶ κατῴκισαν τὰ βδελύγμα-
    τα αὐτῶν ἐν τοῖς οἴκοις τῶν ὑψηλῶν ἃ ἐποίησαν ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ, ἔ-
    θνος ἔθνος ἐν πόλει, ἐν ᾗ κατῴκουν ἐν αὐτῇ. καὶ ἦσαν φοβούμε-
    νοι τὸν Κύριον, καὶ ἐποίησαν ἑαυτοῖς ἱερεῖς τῶν ὑψηλῶν, καὶ ἐ-
    ποίησαν ἑαυτοῖς ἐν οἴκῳ τῶν ὑψηλῶν.
33 Τὸν Κύριον ἐφοβοῦντο, καὶ τοῖς θεοῖς αὐτῶν ἐλάτρευον κατὰ τὸ
    κρίμα τῶν ἐθνῶν, ὅθεν ἀπῴκισαν αὐτοὺς ἐκεῖθεν.
34 Ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης αὐτοὶ ἐποίουν κατὰ τὸ κρίμα αὐτῶν· αὐ-
    τοὶ φοβοῦνται, καὶ αὐτοὶ ποιοῦσι κατὰ τὰ δικαιώματα αὐτῶν, καὶ
    κατὰ τὴν κρίσιν αὐτῶν, καὶ κατὰ τὸν νόμον, καὶ κατὰ τὴν ἐντο-
    λήν,
35 ἣν ἐνετείλατο Κύριος τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰακὼβ οὗ ἔθηκε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ
    Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ διέθετο Κύριος μετ᾿ αὐτῶν διαθήκην, καὶ ἐνετείλα-
    το αὐτοῖς, λέγων· οὐ φοβηθήσεσθε
36 θεοὺς ἑτέρους, καὶ οὐ προσκυνήσετε αὐτοῖς, καὶ οὐ λατρεύσετε
    αὐτοῖς, καὶ οὐ θυμιάσετε αὐτοῖς, ὅτι ἀλλ᾿ ἢ τῷ Κυρίῳ ὃς ἀνήγα-
    γεν ὑμᾶς ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου ἐν ἰσχύϊ μεγάλῃ, καὶ ἐν βραχίονι ὑ-
    ψηλῷ· αὐτὸν φοβηθήσεσθε, καὶ προσκυνήσετε αὐτῷ, καὶ αὐτῷ θυ-
    μιάσετε.
37 Καὶ τὰ δικαιώματα, καὶ τὰ κρίματα, καὶ τὸν νόμον, καὶ τὰς ἐν-
    τολάς, ἃς ἔγραψεν ὑμῖν, φυλάσσεσθε ποιεῖν πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας,
    καὶ οὐ φοβηθήσεσθε θεοὺς ἑτέρους.
38 Καὶ τὴν διαθήκην ἣν διέθετο μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν οὐκ ἐπιλήσεσθε· καὶ
    οὐ φοβηθήσεσθε θεοὺς
39 ἑτέρους, (ὅτι) ἀλλ᾿ ἢ τὸν Κύριον θεὸν ὑμῶν φοβηθήσεσθε, καὶ
    αὐτὸς ἐξελεῖται ὑμᾶς ἐκ πάντων τῶν ἐχθρῶν ὑμῶν.
40 Καὶ οὐκ ἀκούσεσθε ἐπὶ τὸ κρίματι αὐτῶν, ὃ αὐτοὶ ποιοῦσι. Καὶ
    ἦσαν τὰ ἔθνη ταῦτα φοβούμενοι τὸν Κύριον, καὶ τοῖς γλυπτοῖς
    αὐτῶν ἦσαν
41 δουλεύοντες, καί γε οἱ υἱοὶ, καὶ υἱοὶ τῶν υἱῶν αὐτῶν, καθὰ ἐ-
    ποίησαν οἱ πατέρες αὐτῶν, ποιοῦσιν ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης.

### Literary Translation:

### 2 Kings 17

**29** LORD. Yet each nation made its own gods; and they set them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, each nation in its [own] city, wherein they themselves did dwell.
**30** And the men of Babylon made Succoth-Benoth; and the men of Cuth made Nergal; and the men of Hamath made Ashima;
**31** and the Avvites made Nabazaer, and Nibhaz, and Tartak; and the Sepharvites, when they burned their sons in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.
**32** And they feared the LORD; yet they set their abominations in the houses of the high places which they had made in Samaria, each nation in the city wherein they dwelt. And they feared the LORD, and made for themselves priests of the high places, and established for themselves [their sacred rites] in the house of the high places.
**33** The LORD they feared, yet their own gods they served, according to the custom of the nations from whence they had been carried away from thence.
**34** Unto this day they perform according to their former custom: they fear [the LORD], and they practice according to their own statutes, and according to their own ordinances, and according to the Law, and according to the commandment,
**35** which the LORD commanded unto the sons of Jacob, whom He named Israel. For the LORD had made a covenant with them, and had charged them, saying, "Ye shall not fear
**36** other gods, neither shall ye bow down to them, nor serve them, nor burn incense unto them; but rather the LORD, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great might and with an outstretched arm—Him shall ye fear, and unto Him shall ye bow down, and unto Him shall ye burn incense.
**37** And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the Law, and the commandments, which He wrote for you, ye shall take heed to perform all the days, and ye shall not fear other gods.
**38** And the covenant which He made with you, ye shall not forget; neither shall ye fear
**39** other gods, but rather the LORD your God shall ye fear, and He Himself shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.
**40** And ye shall not hearken unto their judgment, which they themselves do. Yet these nations did fear the LORD, and unto their graven images did they
**41** serve; and indeed the sons, and the sons of their sons, even as their fathers did, so do they unto this day.
