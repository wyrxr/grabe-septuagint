ΚΕΦ. ΚΒ. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Δ´. 707
βίβλου οὓς ἀνέγνω βασιλεὺς Ἰούδα, ἀφ᾿ ὧν ἐγκατέλιπόν με, καὶ 17
ἐθυμίων θεοῖς ἑτέροις, ὅπως παροργίσωσί με ἐν τοῖς ἔργοις τῶν
χειρῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐκκαυθήσεται ὁ θυμός μου ἐν τῷ τόπῳ τούτῳ,
καὶ οὐ σβεσθήσεται. Καὶ πρὸς βασιλέα Ἰούδα τὸν ἀποστείλαντα 18
ὑμᾶς ἐπιζητῆσαι τὸν Κύριον, τάδε ἐρεῖτε πρὸς αὐτόν· τάδε λέ-
γει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ· οἱ λόγοι οὓς ἤκουσας, ἀφ᾿ ὧν ὅτι 19
ἠπαλύνθη ἡ καρδία σου, καὶ ἐνετράπης ἀπὸ προσώπου Κυρίου,
ὡς ἤκουσας ὅσα ἐλάλησα ἐπὶ τὸν τόπον τοῦτον, καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς ἐνοι-
κοῦντας αὐτόν, τοῦ εἶναι εἰς ἀφανισμόν, καὶ εἰς κατάραν, καὶ
διέρρηξας τὰ ἱμάτιά σου, καὶ ἔκλαυσας ἐνώπιον μου, καὶ γε ἐγὼ
ἤκουσα, λέγει Κύριος· οὕτως· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ προστίθημί σε πρὸς 20
τοὺς πατέρας σου, καὶ συναχθήσῃ εἰς τὸν τάφον σου ἐν Ἱερουσα-
λὴμ, καὶ οὐκ ὀφθήσεται ἐν τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς σου ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς κα-
κοῖς οἷς ἐγώ εἰμι ἐπάγω ἐπὶ τὸν τόπον τοῦτον.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΓ´. ΧΧΙΙΙ.

ΚΑΙ ἐπέστρεψαν τῷ βασιλεῖ τὸ ῥῆμα. καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ὁ βα- 1
σιλεὺς, καὶ συνήγαγε πρὸς ἑαυτὸν πάντας τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους
Ἰούδα καὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ ἀνέβη ὁ βασιλεὺς εἰς οἶκον Κυρίου, 2
καὶ πᾶς ἀνὴρ Ἰούδα, καὶ πάντες οἱ κατοικοῦντες ἐν Ἱερουσα-
λὴμ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς, καὶ οἱ προφῆται, καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς
μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ μικροῦ καὶ ἕως μεγάλου, καὶ ἀνέγνω ἐν τοῖς
ὠσὶν αὐτῶν πάντας τοὺς λόγους τοῦ βιβλίου τῆς διαθήκης τοῦ
εὑρεθέντος ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου. Καὶ ἔστη ὁ βασιλεὺς πρὸς τὸν στύ- 3
λον, καὶ διέθετο διαθήκην ἐνώπιον Κυρίου τοῦ πορεύεσθαι ὀπίσω
Κυρίου, καὶ τοῦ φυλάσσειν τὰς ἐντολὰς αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰ μαρτύρια
αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰ δικαιώματα αὐτοῦ ἐν πάσῃ καρδίᾳ, καὶ ἐν πάσῃ
ψυχῇ, τοῦ ἀναστῆσαι τοὺς λόγους τῆς διαθήκης ταύτης, τὰ γε-
γραμμένα ἐπὶ τὸ βιβλίον τοῦτο. Καὶ ἔστη πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ἐν τῇ δια-
θήκῃ. Καὶ ἐνετείλατο ὁ βασιλεὺς τῷ Χελκίᾳ τῷ ἱερεῖ τῷ μεγάλῳ, 4
καὶ τοῖς ἱερεῦσι τῆς δευτερώσεως, καὶ τοῖς φυλάσσουσι τὸν
σταθμόν, τοῦ ἐξαγαγεῖν ἐκ τοῦ ναοῦ Κυρίου πάντα τὰ σκεύη τὰ
πεποιημένα τῷ Βάαλ, καὶ τῷ ἄλσει, καὶ πάσῃ τῇ δυνάμει τοῦ
οὐρανοῦ. Καὶ κατέκαυσεν αὐτὰ ἔξω Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐν σαδημὼθ Κέ-
δρων, καὶ ἔβαλε τὸν χοῦν αὐτῶν εἰς Βαιθήλ. Καὶ κατέπαυσε 5

### Literary Translation:

### 2 Kings 22

**16** book, which the king of Judah hath read; because they have forsaken Me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke Me to wrath with the works of their hands. And My wrath shall be kindled in this place, and it shall not be quenched.'
**18** But concerning the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the Lord, thus shall ye say unto him: 'Thus saith the Lord God of Israel:
**19** Concerning the words which thou hast heard, because that thy heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before the Lord, when thou didst hear what I spake against this place and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and didst rend thy garments, and didst weep before Me; I also, verily, have heard thee, saith the Lord.
**20** Thus: 'Behold, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in Jerusalem; and thine eyes shall not see all the evils which I am bringing upon this place.'"

### 2 Kings 23

**1** And they returned the word unto the king. And the king sent, and gathered unto him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem.
**2** And the king went up into the house of the Lord, and all the men of Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great; and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the Lord.
**3** And the king stood by the pillar, and made a covenant before the Lord, to walk after the Lord, and to keep His commandments, and His testimonies, and His statutes with all [thy] heart and with all [thy] soul, to establish the words of this covenant that were written in this book. And all the people stood [firm] in the covenant.
**4** And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and them that kept the threshold, to bring forth out of the temple of the Lord all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the Asherah, and for all the host of heaven. And he burned them outside Jerusalem in the terraces of Kidron, and cast their dust into Bethel.
**5** And he put down
