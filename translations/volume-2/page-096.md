ΚΕΦ. ΙΔʹ. ΙΕ.
μερὶς ἐν ἀγρῷ τοῦ Ἰωὰβ ἐχόμενά μου, καὶ αὐτῷ κριθαὶ ἐκεῖ· πορεύεσθε, καὶ ἐμπρήσατε αὐτὴν ἐν πυρί. Καὶ ἐνέπρησαν (αὐτὰς) οἱ παῖδες Ἀβεσσαλὼμ τὴν μερίδα. Καὶ παραγίνονται οἱ δοῦλοι Ἰωὰβ πρὸς αὐτὸν διερρηχότες τὰ ἱμάτια ἑαυτῶν, καὶ εἶπαν· ἐνεπύρισαν οἱ δοῦλοι Ἀβεσσαλὼμ τὴν μερίδα ἐν πυρί.
**31** Καὶ ἀνέστη Ἰωάβ, καὶ ἦλθε πρὸς Ἀβεσσαλὼμ εἰς τὸν οἶκον, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτόν· ἵνατί ἐνεπύρισαν οἱ παῖδές σου τὴν μερίδα τὴν ἐμὴν ἐν πυρί;
**32** Καὶ εἶπεν Ἀβεσσαλὼμ πρὸς Ἰωάβ· Ἰδοὺ ἀπέστειλα πρὸς σε λέγων, Ἥκε ὧδε, καὶ ἀποστελῶ σε πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα λέγων, Ἱνατί ἦλθον ἐκ Γεδσούρ; ἀγαθὸν μοι ἦν τοῦ ἔτι εἶναί με ἐκεῖ· καὶ νῦν ἰδοὺ οὐκ εἶδον τὸ πρόσωπον τοῦ βασιλέως· εἰ δέ ἐστιν ἐν ἐμοὶ ἀδικία, καὶ θανάτωσόν με.
**33** Καὶ εἰσῆλθεν Ἰωὰβ πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα, καὶ ἀνήγγειλεν αὐτῷ· καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸν Ἀβεσσαλώμ, καὶ εἰσῆλθε πρὸς βασιλέα, καὶ προσεκύνησεν αὐτῷ, καὶ ἔπεσεν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, καὶ κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ βασιλέως. Καὶ κατεφίλησεν ὁ βασιλεύς τὸν Ἀβεσσαλώμ.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΕ. XV.

**1** ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο μετὰ ταῦτα, καὶ ἐποίησεν αὐτῷ Ἀβεσσαλὼμ ἅρματα καὶ ἵππους, καὶ πεντήκοντα ἄνδρας παρατρέχειν ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ.
**2** Καὶ ὤρθρισεν Ἀβεσσαλώμ, καὶ ἔστη ἀνὰ χεῖρα τῆς ὁδοῦ τῆς πύλης. Καὶ ἐγένετο πᾶς ἀνὴρ ᾧ ἐγένετο κρίσις, ἦλθε πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα εἰς κρίσιν, καὶ ἐβόησεν Ἀβεσσαλὼμ πρὸς αὐτόν, καὶ ἔλεγεν αὐτῷ· ἐκ ποίας πόλεως εἶ σύ; καὶ εἶπεν ὁ ἀνήρ· ἐκ
**3** μιᾶς φυλῶν Ἰσραὴλ ὁ δοῦλός σου. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτόν· Ἀβεσσαλώμ· Ἰδοὺ οἱ λόγοι σου ἀγαθοὶ καὶ εὔκολοι, καὶ ἀκούων (σου) οὐκ ἔστιν σοι παρὰ τοῦ βασιλέως.
**4** Καὶ εἶπεν Ἀβεσσαλώμ· τίς με καταστήσει κριτὴν ἐν τῇ γῇ, καὶ ἐπ᾿ ἐμοῦ ἐπελεύσεται πᾶς ἀνὴρ ᾧ ἐὰν ᾖ ἀντιλογία καὶ κρίσις, καὶ δικαιώσω αὐτόν;
**5** Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἐγγίζειν ἄνδρα τοῦ προσκυνῆσαι αὐτῷ, καὶ ἐξέτεινε τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ, καὶ κατελαμβάνετο αὐτοῦ, καὶ κατεφίλησεν αὐτόν.
**6** Καὶ ἐποίησεν Ἀβεσσαλὼμ κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο παντὶ Ἰσραήλ, τοῖς παραγινομένοις εἰς κρίσιν πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα, καὶ ἰδιοποιεῖτο Ἀβεσσαλὼμ τὴν καρδίαν ἀνδρῶν Ἰσραήλ.
**7** Καὶ ἐγένετο ἀπὸ τέλους

**14:30** ...Joab's portion in the field adjoins mine, and he has barley there; go ye, and set it on fire with fire." And Absalom's servants did burn the portion, [even] the barley, with fire. Then came the servants of Joab unto him, having torn their garments, and said, "Absalom's servants have set the portion on fire with fire."

**31** And Joab arose, and came unto Absalom into his house, and said unto him, "Wherefore have your servants set my portion on fire with fire?"

**32** And Absalom said unto Joab, "Behold, I sent unto you, saying, 'Come hither, and I will send you unto the king, saying, "Wherefore came I from Geshur? It had been better for me to have been there still. And now, behold, I have not seen the king's face. If then there be iniquity in me, then slay me."'"

**33** And Joab came in unto the king, and declared [these things] unto him. And [the king] called for Absalom; and he came in unto the king, and bowed himself to him, and fell upon his face to the ground, even before the face of the king. And the king kissed Absalom.

### CHAPTER XV.

**1** And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared for himself chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.

**2** And Absalom rose up early, and stood by the side of the way of the gate. And it was so, that when any man who had a controversy came unto the king for judgment, Absalom would call unto him, and say, "From what city are you?" And the man would answer, "Your servant is of one of the tribes of Israel."

**3** And Absalom said unto him, "Behold, your words are good and just, but there is none [appointed] to hear you from the king."

**4** And Absalom said, "O that I were made judge in the land! That every man who has any controversy or judgment might come unto me, and I would do him justice!"

**5** And it came to pass, when any man drew nigh to bow himself unto him, that he would put forth his hand, and take hold of him, and kiss him.

**6** And Absalom did after this manner unto all Israel, even unto those who came to the king for judgment: thus did Absalom steal the hearts of the men of Israel.
