#### CHAPTER XXVI. [CONTINUED]

⁷ ...and among [the Philistines]. And the Lord strengthened him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt upon the rock, and against the Meunim.
⁸ And the Meunim gave gifts unto Uzziah; and his name spread abroad even unto the entrance of Egypt, for he waxed exceeding strong [far] upward.
⁹ Moreover, Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem, even upon the Corner Gate, and upon the Gate of the Valley, and upon the bulwarks; and he made [them] strong.
¹⁰ He built also towers in the wilderness, and hewed out many wells; for he had much cattle in the Shephelah, and in the plain; and vine-dressers in the mountains and in Carmel; for he was a lover of husbandry.
¹¹ And Uzziah had an army waging war, that went out to battle by companies, by number. And the number of them was taken by the hand of Jeiel the scribe, and Maaseiah the judge, by the hand of Hananiah the king's lieutenant.
