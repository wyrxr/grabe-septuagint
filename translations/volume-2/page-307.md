ΚΑΙ ἦλθε Ῥοβοὰμ εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἐξεκλησίασε τὸν 1
Ἰούδαν καὶ Βενιαμείν, ἑκατὸν ὀγδοήκοντα χιλιάδας νεανίσκων
ποιούντων πόλεμον, καὶ ἐπολέμει πρὸς Ἰσραὴλ τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι τὴν
βασιλείαν τῷ Ῥοβοάμ. Καὶ ἐγένετο λόγος Κυρίου πρὸς Σαμαίαν 2
ἄνθρωπον τοῦ Θεοῦ, λέγων· εἶπον πρὸς Ῥοβοὰμ τὸν τοῦ Σαλωμῶν, 3
καὶ πρὸς πάντα Ἰούδα, καὶ Βενιαμείν, λέγων· τάδε λέγει Κύριος· 4
οὐχ ἀναβήσεστε, οὐδὲ πολεμήσετε πρὸς τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς ὑμῶν· ἀπο-
στράφητε ἕκαστος εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ, ὅτι παρ᾽ ἐμοῦ ἐγένετο τὸ
ῥῆμα τοῦτο· καὶ ὑπήκουσαν τοῦ λόγου Κυρίου, καὶ ἀπεστράφησαν
τοῦ μὴ πορευθῆναι ἐπὶ Ἱεροβοάμ. Καὶ κατώκησε Ῥοβοὰμ εἰς Ἱε- 5
ρουσαλήμ, καὶ ᾠκοδόμησε πόλεις τειχήρεις ἐν τῇ Ἰουδαίᾳ· καὶ ᾠ- 6
κοδόμησε τὴν Βηθλεέμ, καὶ τὴν Αἰτάν, καὶ τὴν Θεκωέ, καὶ τὴν 7
Βαιθσουρά, καὶ τὴν Σοχωθ, καὶ τὴν Ὀδολλάμ, καὶ τὴν Γέθ, καὶ 8
τὴν Μαρισάν, καὶ τὴν Ζείφ, καὶ τὴν Ἀδωραΐμ, καὶ Λαχεῖς, καὶ τὴν 9
Ἀζηκά, καὶ τὴν Σαραά, καὶ τὴν Ἀιαλών, καὶ τὴν Χεβρών, ἥ ἐστι 10
τοῦ Ἰούδα καὶ Βενιαμείν, πόλεις τειχήρεις. Καὶ ὠχύρωσεν αὐ- 11
τὰς τειχήρεις, καὶ ἔδωκεν ἐν αὐταῖς ἡγουμένους, καὶ παραθέσεις 12
βρωμάτων, ἐλαίου καὶ οἴνου, κατὰ πόλιν καὶ κατὰ πόλιν θυρεούς,
καὶ δόρατα, καὶ κατίσχυσεν αὐτὰς εἰς πλῆθος σφόδρα, καὶ ἦσαν
αὐτῷ Ἰούδα καὶ Βενιαμείν· καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς, καὶ οἱ Λευῖται οἱ ἦσαν 13
ἐν παντὶ Ἰσραὴλ συνήχθησαν πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐκ πάντων τῶν ὁρίων·
ὅτι ἐγκατέλιπον οἱ Λευῖται τὰ σκηνώματα τῆς κατασχέσεως αὐ- 14
τῶν, καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν πρὸς Ἰούδα εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ, ὅτι ἐξέβαλεν
αὐτοὺς Ἱεροβοάμ, καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ τοῦ μὴ λειτουργεῖν τῷ Κυ-
ρίῳ. Καὶ κατέστησεν ἑαυτῷ ἱερεῖς τῶν ὑψηλῶν, καὶ τοῖς εἰδώ- 15
λοις, καὶ τοῖς ματαίοις, καὶ τοῖς μόσχοις, ἃ ἐποίησεν Ἱεροβοάμ·
καὶ ἐξέβαλεν αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ φυλῶν Ἰσραήλ, οἳ ἔδωκαν καρδίαν ἑαυ- 16
τῶν τοῦ ζητῆσαι τὸν Κύριον Θεὸν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἦλθον εἰς Ἱερου-
σαλήμ θῦσαι Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ τῶν πατέρων αὐτῶν. Καὶ κατίσχυ- 17
σαν τὴν βασιλείαν Ἰούδα· καὶ κατίσχυσε Ῥοβοὰμ τὸν τοῦ Σαλω-
μῶν εἰς ἔτη τρία, ὅτι ἐπορεύθη ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς Δαυὶδ καὶ Σαλωμῶν
ἔτη τρία. Καὶ ἔλαβεν ἑαυτῷ Ῥοβοὰμ γυναῖκα τὴν Μοολάθ, θυ- 18
γατέρα Ἰεριμοὺθ υἱοῦ Δαυίδ, καὶ Ἀβιαία θυγατέρα Ἐλιὰβ τοῦ [Ἰεσσαί.]

**Chapter 11**

1 And Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, and he assembled Judah and Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand young men, who were makers of war, that he might fight against Israel, to restore the kingdom unto Rehoboam.

2 And the word of the Lord came unto Shemaiah, a man of God, saying,

3 "Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, and unto all Judah and Benjamin, saying,

4 'Thus saith the Lord: Ye shall not go up, neither shall ye fight against your brethren; return ye every man unto his house, for from Me hath this thing come to pass.'" And they hearkened to the word of the Lord, and turned back from going against Jeroboam.

5 And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built walled cities in Judah.

6 And he built Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,

7 And Beth-zur, and Soco, and Adullam,

8 And Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph, and Adoraim,

9 And Lachish, and Azekah, and Zorah, and Aijalon,

10 And Hebron, which are in Judah and Benjamin, [even] walled cities.

11 And he fortified them with walls, and placed in them leaders,

12 And provisions of food, of oil and wine, in every city, and shields and spears. And he strengthened them exceedingly, and Judah and Benjamin were his.

13 And the priests, and the Levites who were in all Israel, gathered themselves unto him from all their territories,

14 Because the Levites had forsaken the pasture lands of their possession and had departed unto Judah, even unto Jerusalem, forasmuch as Jeroboam and his sons had cast them out from ministering unto the Lord.

15 For he had appointed for himself priests for the high places, and for the idols, and for the vain things, and for the calves which Jeroboam had made.

16 And he cast them [the Levites] out from the tribes of Israel; [yet,] from all the tribes of Israel, such as gave their heart to seek the Lord God of Israel, came unto Jerusalem to sacrifice unto the Lord God of their fathers.

17 And they strengthened the kingdom of Judah; and Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, was strengthened for three years, because he walked in the ways of David and Solomon for three years.

18 And Rehoboam took unto himself a wife, Moölath, the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, and Abiail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse.
