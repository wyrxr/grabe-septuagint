826 ΠΑΡΑΛΕΙΠΟΜΕΝΩΝ ΚΕΦ. ΛΕ΄.
Ἀσάφ, καὶ Αἰμάν, καὶ Ἰδιθοῦν οἱ προφῆται τοῦ βασιλέως· καὶ οἱ
ἄρχοντες, καὶ οἱ πυλωροὶ τῆς πύλης καὶ πύλης, οὐκ ἦν αὐτοῖς κι-
νείσθαι ἀπὸ τῆς λειτουργίας ἁγίων, ὅτι ἀδελφοὶ αὐτῶν οἱ Λευῖται
16 ἑτοίμασαν αὐτοῖς. Καὶ κατωρθώθη καὶ ἡτοιμάσθη πᾶσα ἡ λειτουρ-
γία Κυρίου ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ τοῦ ποιῆσαι τὸ Φασέκ, καὶ ἐνέγ-
κειν τὰ ὁλοκαυτώματα ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον Κυρίου κατὰ τὴν ἐν-
17 τολὴν τοῦ βασιλέως Ἰωσία. Καὶ ἐποίησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ οἱ εὑ-
ρεθέντες τὸ Φασὲκ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ, καὶ τὴν ἑορτὴν τῶν ἀζύ-
18 μων ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας. Καὶ οὐκ ἐγένετο Φασὲκ ὅμοιον αὐτῷ ἐν Ἰσ-
ραὴλ, ἀπὸ ἡμερῶν Σαμουὴλ τοῦ προφήτου· καὶ πάντες βασιλεῖς
Ἰσραὴλ οὐκ ἐποίησαν ὡς τὸ Φασὲκ ὃ ἐποίησεν Ἰωσίας· καὶ οἱ ἱε-
ρεῖς καὶ Λευῖται, καὶ πᾶς Ἰούδα καὶ Ἰσραὴλ ὁ εὑρεθεὶς, καὶ οἱ
19 κατοικοῦντες ἐν Ἰερουσαλὴμ τῷ Κυρίῳ. Τῷ ὀκτωκαιδεκάτῳ ἔτει
τῆς βασιλείας Ἰωσία ἐποιήθη τὸ Φασὲκ τοῦτο. Μετὰ ταῦτα πάν-
τα ἃ ἔδρασεν Ἰωσίας ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ, καὶ τοὺς ἐγγαστριμύθους, καὶ
τοὺς γνώστας, καὶ τὰ Θεραφείμ, καὶ τὰ εἴδωλα, καὶ τὰ Καρασεὶμ
ἃ ἦν ἐν τῇ γῇ Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐν Ἰερουσαλὴμ, καὶ ἐνεπύρισεν ὁ βασι-
λεὺς Ἰωσίας, ἵνα στήσῃ τοὺς λόγους τοῦ νόμου τοὺς γεγραμμένους
ἐπὶ βιβλίου οὗ εὗρε Χελκίας ὁ ἱερεὺς ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ Κυρίου· ὅμοιος
αὐτῷ οὐκ ἐγενήθη ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ, ὃς ἐπέστρεφε πρὸς Κύριον ἐν
ὅλῃ καρδίᾳ ἑαυτοῦ, καὶ ἐν ὅλῃ ψυχῇ ἑαυτοῦ, καὶ ἐν ὅλῃ ἰσχύϊ ἑαυ-
τοῦ κατὰ πάντα τὸν νόμον Μωυσῆ, καὶ μετ᾽ αὐτὸν οὐκ ἀνέστη
ὅμοιος αὐτῷ· πλὴν οὐκ ἀπεστράφη Κύριος ἀπὸ ὀργῆς θυμοῦ αὐτοῦ
τοῦ μεγάλου, οὗ ὠργίσθη θυμῷ Κύριος ἐν τῷ Ἰούδα, ἐπὶ πάντα
τὰ παροργίσματα ἃ παρώργισε Μανασσῆς. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος· καὶ
γε τὸν Ἰούδαν ἀποστήσω ἀπὸ προσώπου μου, καθὼς ἀπέστησα τὸν
Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ ἀπωσάμην τὴν πόλιν ἣν ἐξελεξάμην τὴν Ἰερουσαλὴμ,
καὶ τὸν οἶκον ὃν εἶπα, ἔσται τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐκεῖ.
20 Καὶ ἀνέβη Φαραὼ Νεχαὼ βασιλεὺς Αἰγύπτου ἐπὶ τὸν βασιλέα Ἀσσυρίων, καὶ
ἐπὶ τὸν ποταμὸν Εὐφράτην, καὶ ἐπορεύθη ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἰωσίας εἰς
21 συνάντησιν αὐτῷ, καὶ ἀπέστειλε πρὸς αὐτὸν ἀγγέλους, λέγων· τί
ἐμοὶ καὶ σοὶ βασιλεῦ Ἰούδα; οὐκ ἐπὶ σὲ ἥκω σήμερον πόλεμον ποιῆ-
σαι· καὶ ὁ Θεὸς εἶπε τοῦ κατασπεῦσαί με· πρόσεχε ἀπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ
22 τοῦ μετ᾽ ἐμοῦ μὴ καταφθείρῃ σε. Καὶ οὐκ ἀπέστρεψεν Ἰωσίας τὸ
πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἀπ᾽ αὐτοῦ, ἀλλ᾽ ἢ πολεμεῖν αὐτὸν ἐκραταιώθη, καὶ
οὐκ ἤκουσε τῶν λόγων Νεχαὼ διὰ στόματος Θεοῦ, καὶ ἦλθε τοῦ

**Chapter 35 [continued]**

¹⁵...Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun, the prophets of the king. And the chiefs, and the gatekeepers of the gate, and of the gate, were not permitted to remove themselves from the holy service; for their brethren, the Levites, prepared for them.

¹⁶ Thus was established and prepared all the service of the LORD on that day, to keep the Passover, and to bring the burnt offerings upon the altar of the LORD, according to the commandment of Josiah the king.

¹⁷ And the children of Israel that were found did the Passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.

¹⁸ And there was no Passover like unto it in Israel, from the days of Samuel the prophet. Neither did any of the kings of Israel keep such a Passover as Josiah kept; [even] the priests and Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were found, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, [kept it] unto the LORD.

¹⁹ In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this Passover held.

After all these things which Josiah had wrought in the House, and [after he had purged away] the mediums, and the soothsayers, and the teraphim, and the idols, and the carved images, which were in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem; and King Josiah burned them with fire, that he might establish the words of the Law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest had found in the House of the LORD. There was none like unto him before him, who turned to the LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the Law of Moses; neither after him arose there any like him. Nevertheless, the LORD turned not from the fierceness of His great wrath, wherewith the LORD was wroth in Judah, because of all the provocations wherewith Manasseh had provoked Him. And the LORD said: 'Yea, I will also remove Judah from My presence, as I have removed Israel, and I have cast away the city which I have chosen, even Jerusalem, and the House of which I said, "My Name shall be there." '

²⁰ And Pharaoh Necho, king of Egypt, went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates; and King Josiah went forth to meet him.

²¹ And Necho sent messengers unto him, saying, 'What [have I to do] with thee, thou king of Judah? I come not against thee this day to make war; and God hath commanded me to make haste. Forbear thee from God who is with me, lest He destroy thee.'

²² Nevertheless, Josiah turned not his face from him, but strengthened himself to fight against him, and hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God; and came to...
