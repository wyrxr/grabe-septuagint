Χαναναίων, καὶ Χετταίων, καὶ Ἀμοῤῥαίων, καὶ Φερεζαίων, καὶ
Ἰεβουσαίων, καὶ Γεργεσαίων, καὶ τῷ σπέρματι αὐτοῦ. καὶ ἔζησας
9 τοὺς λόγους σου ὅτι δίκαιος σύ, καὶ ἴδες τὴν ταπείνωσιν τῶν πα-
τέρων ἡμῶν ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ, καὶ τὴν κραυγὴν αὐτῶν ἤκουσας ἐπὶ θα-
10 λάσσαν ἐρυθράν. Καὶ ἔδωκας σημεῖα καὶ τέρατα ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ ἐν
Φαραῶ, καὶ ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς παισὶν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐν παντὶ τῷ λαῷ τῆς
γῆς αὐτοῦ, ὅτι ἔγνως ὅτι ὑπερηφάνησαν ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς, καὶ ἐποίησας
11 σεαυτῷ ὄνομα ὡς ἡ ἡμέρα αὕτη. Καὶ τὴν θάλασσαν ἔῤῥηξας ἐνώ-
πιον αὐτῶν, καὶ παρῆλθοσαν ἐν μέσῳ τῆς θαλάσσης ἐν ξηρασίᾳ,
καὶ τοὺς καταδιώκοντας αὐτοὺς ἐῤῥίψας εἰς βυθὸν, ὡσεὶ λίθον ἐν
12 ὕδατι σφοδρῷ. Καὶ ἐν στύλῳ νεφέλης ὡδήγησας αὐτοὺς ἡμέρας,
καὶ ἐν στύλῳ πυρὸς τὴν νύκτα, τοῦ φωτίσαι αὐτοῖς τὴν ὁδὸν ἐν ᾗ
13 πορεύσονται ἐν αὐτῇ. Καὶ ἐπὶ ὄρος Σινὰ κατέβης, καὶ ἐλάλησας
πρὸς αὐτοὺς ἐξ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ ἔδωκας αὐτοῖς κρίματα εὐθέα, καὶ
14 νόμους ἀληθείας, προσάγματα καὶ ἐντολὰς ἀγαθάς. Καὶ τὸ σάβ-
βατόν σου τὸ ἅγιον ἐγνώρισας αὐτοῖς, ἐντολὰς καὶ προστάγματα
15 καὶ νόμον ἐνετείλω αὐτοῖς ἐν χειρὶ Μωϋσῆ τοῦ δούλου σου. Καὶ
ἄρτον ἐξ οὐρανοῦ ἔδωκας αὐτοῖς εἰς σιτοδείαν αὐτῶν, καὶ ὕδωρ ἐκ
πέτρας ἐξήνεγκας αὐτοῖς εἰς δίψαν αὐτῶν. καὶ εἶπας αὐτοῖς εἰσελ-
θεῖν κληρονομῆσαι τὴν γῆν εἰς ἣν ἐξέτεινας τὴν χεῖρά σου, δοῦναι
16 αὐτοῖς· καὶ αὐτοὶ, καὶ οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν ὑπερηφανεύσαντο, καὶ
ἐσκλήρυναν τὸν τράχηλον αὐτῶν, καὶ οὐκ ἤκουσαν τῶν ἐντολῶν
17 σου. Καὶ ἀνένευσαν τοῦ εἰσακοῦσαι, καὶ οὐκ ἐμνήσθησαν τῶν θαυ-
μασίων σου ὧν ἐποίησας μετ’ αὐτῶν. καὶ ἐσκλήρυναν τὸν τράχη-
λον ἑαυτῶν, καὶ ἔδωκαν ἀρχὴν ἐπιστρέψαι εἰς δουλείαν αὐτῶν ἐν
Αἰγύπτῳ. καὶ σὺ Θεὸς ἐλεήμων καὶ οἰκτίρμων, μακρόθυμος καὶ
18 πολυέλεος, καὶ οὐκ ἐγκατέλιπες αὐτούς. Ἔτι δὲ καὶ ἐποίησαν ἑαυ-
τοῖς μόσχον χωνευτὸν, καὶ εἶπαν· οὗτοι οἱ θεοὶ οἱ ἐξαγαγόντες
19 ἡμᾶς ἐξ Αἰγύπτου. καὶ ἐποίησαν παροργισμοὺς μεγάλους. Καὶ
σὺ ἐν οἰκτιρμοῖς σου τοῖς μεγάλους οὐκ ἐγκατέλιπες αὐτοὺς ἐν τῇ
ἐρήμῳ, τὸν στύλον τῆς νεφέλης οὐκ ἐξέκλινας ἀπ’ αὐτῶν ἡμέρας,
ὁδηγῆσαι αὐτοὺς ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ, καὶ τὸν στύλον τοῦ πυρὸς τὴν νύκτα,
20 φωτίζειν αὐτοῖς τὴν ὁδὸν ἐν ᾗ πορεύσονται ἐν αὐτῇ. Καὶ τὸ πνεῦ-
μά σου τὸ ἀγαθὸν ἔδωκας συνετίσαι αὐτοὺς· καὶ τὸ μάννα σου οὐκ
ἀφυστέρησας ἀπὸ στόματος αὐτῶν, καὶ ὕδωρ ἔδωκας αὐτοῖς ἐν τῷ
21 δίψει αὐτῶν· καὶ τεσσαράκοντα ἔτη διέθρεψας αὐτοὺς ἐν τῇ ἐρή-

#### NEHEMIAH CHAPTER 9

<sup>8</sup> Canaanites, and Hittites, and Amorites,
and Perizzites, and Jebusites, and Girgashites,
and to his seed. And Thou didst fulfill Thy words, for Thou art righteous.

<sup>9</sup> And Thou didst see the low estate of our fathers in Egypt,
and their cry didst Thou hear at the Red Sea.

<sup>10</sup> And Thou gavest signs and wonders in Egypt,
against Pharaoh, and against all his servants,
and against all the people of his land;
for Thou knewest that they had dealt proudly against them.
And Thou didst make Thee a Name, as [it is] this day.

<sup>11</sup> And the sea didst Thou cleave before them,
and they passed through the midst of the sea on dry ground;
and their pursuers didst Thou cast into the deep,
as a stone in mighty waters.

<sup>12</sup> Moreover, by a pillar of cloud didst Thou lead them by day,
and by a pillar of fire by night,
to give light unto them the way wherein they should go.

<sup>13</sup> And upon Mount Sinai didst Thou come down,
and didst speak unto them from heaven,
and gavest them righteous judgments,
and laws of truth, statutes and good commandments.

<sup>14</sup> And Thy holy Sabbath didst Thou make known unto them,
and didst command them commandments and statutes and a law,
by the hand of Moses Thy servant.

<sup>15</sup> And bread from heaven didst Thou give them for their sustenance,
and water from the rock didst Thou bring forth unto them for their thirst.
And Thou saidst unto them that they should enter
to inherit the land, into which Thou hadst stretched forth Thy hand to give unto them.

<sup>16</sup> But they, and our fathers, dealt proudly,
and stiffened their neck, and hearkened not unto Thy commandments.

<sup>17</sup> And they refused to hear,
and remembered not Thy wonders which Thou hadst done with them.
And they stiffened their neck,
and gave [themselves to] a beginning [of returning] to their bondage in Egypt.
But Thou art a God compassionate and merciful,
long-suffering and plenteous in mercy,
and Thou didst not forsake them.

<sup>18</sup> Yea, and they made for themselves a molten calf,
and said, "These are thy gods who brought us up out of Egypt."
And they wrought great provocations.

<sup>19</sup> Yet Thou, in Thy great compassions, didst not forsake them in the wilderness.
The pillar of the cloud didst Thou not remove from them by day,
to lead them in the way;
nor the pillar of fire by night,
to enlighten them the way wherein they should go.

<sup>20</sup> And Thy good Spirit didst Thou give to instruct them;
and Thy manna didst Thou not withhold from their mouth;
and water didst Thou give them in their thirst.

<sup>21</sup> And forty years didst Thou nourish them in the wilderness—
