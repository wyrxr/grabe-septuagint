ρὸς εἶναι, ὅτι οὐ κεκαθάρισται. Καὶ ἐγενήθη τῇ ἐπαύριον τοῦ 27
μηνὸς τῇ δευτέρᾳ, καὶ ἐπεσκέπη ὁ τόπος τοῦ Δαυίδ. Καὶ εἶπε Σα-
οὺλ πρὸς Ἰωνάθαν τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ· τί ὅτι οὐ παραγέγονεν υἱὸς
Ἰεσσαὶ καὶ ἐχθὲς, καὶ σήμερον ἐπὶ τὴν τράπεζαν; Καὶ ἀπεκρί- 28
θη Ἰωνάθαν τῷ Σαοὺλ, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· παρῄτηται Δαυὶδ παρ’
ἐμοῦ ἕως εἰς Βηθλεὲμ τὴν πόλιν αὐτοῦ πορευθῆναι. Καὶ εἶπεν 29
Ἐξαπόστειλόν με δὴ, ὅτι θυσία τῆς φυλῆς ἡμῖν ἐν τῇ πόλει, καὶ
ἐνετείλατο πρὸς με ὁ ἀδελφός μου· καὶ νῦν εἰ εὕρηκα χάριν ἐν
ὀφθαλμοῖς σου, διασωθήσομαι δὴ καὶ ὄψομαι τοὺς ἀδελφούς μου·
διὰ τοῦτο οὐ παραγέγονεν ἐπὶ τὴν τράπεζαν τοῦ βασιλέως.
Καὶ ἐθυμώθη ὀργῇ Σαοὺλ ἐπὶ Ἰωνάθαν σφόδρα, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· 30
Υἱὲ κορασίων αὐτομολούντων, οὐ γὰρ οἶδα ὅτι μέτοχος εἶ σὺ τῷ
υἱῷ Ἰεσσαὶ εἰς αἰσχύνην σου, καὶ εἰς αἰσχύνην ἀποκαλύψεως μη-
τρός σου? Ὅτι πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας ἃς ὁ υἱὸς Ἰεσσαὶ ζῇ ἐπὶ τῆς 31
γῆς, οὐχ ἑτοιμασθήσεται ἡ βασιλεία σου· νῦν οὖν ἀποστείλας λα-
βὲ τὸν νεανίαν, ὅτι υἱὸς θανάτου οὗτος. Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Ἰωνάθαν 32
τῷ Σαοὺλ τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτόν· ἵνατί ἀποθνή-
σκει; τί πεποίηκε; Καὶ ἔπηρε Σαοὺλ τὸ δόρυ ἐπὶ Ἰωνάθαν τοῦ 33
θανατῶσαι αὐτόν, καὶ ἔγνω Ἰωνάθαν, ὅτι συντετέλεσται ἡ κακία
αὕτη παρὰ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ θανατῶσαι τὸν Δαυίδ. Καὶ ἀπεπή- 34
δησεν Ἰωνάθαν ἀπὸ τῆς τραπέζης ἐν ὀργῇ θυμοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἔφα-
γεν ἐν ἡμέρᾳ τῇ δευτέρᾳ τοῦ μηνὸς ἄρτον, ὅτι ἐθραύσθη ἐπὶ τὸν
Δαυὶδ, ὅτι συντετέλεσεν ἐπ’ αὐτὸν ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐγενήθη 35
πρωῒ, καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Ἰωνάθαν εἰς ἀγρὸν, καθὼς ἐτάξατο Δαυὶδ εἰς
τὸ μαρτύριον, καὶ παιδάριον μικρὸν μετ’ αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπε τῷ παι- 36
δαρίῳ· δράμε, εὑρέ μοι τὰς σχίζας ἐν αἷς ἐγὼ ἀκοντίζω. Καὶ τὸ
παιδάριον ἔδραμε, καὶ αὐτὸς ἠκόντισε τῇ σχίζῃ, καὶ παρήγαγεν
αὐτήν. Καὶ ἦλθε τὸ παιδάριον ἕως τοῦ τόπου τῆς σχίζης οὗ ἠ- 37
κόντισεν Ἰωνάθαν. Καὶ ἀνεβόησεν Ἰωνάθαν ὀπίσω τοῦ νεανίου, 38
καὶ εἶπεν· ἐκεῖ ἡ σχίζα ἀπὸ σοῦ καὶ ἐπέκεινα· καὶ ἐβόησεν Ἰωνάθαν ὀ-
πίσω τοῦ παιδαρίου αὐτοῦ, λέγων· ταχύνας σπεῦσον, καὶ μὴ στῆις· καὶ
ἀνέλεξε τὸ παιδάριον Ἰωνάθαν τὰς σχίζας καὶ ἤνεγκε τὰς σχίζας
πρὸς τὸν κύριον αὐτοῦ. Καὶ τὸ παιδάριον οὐκ ἔγνω οὐδὲν, πάρεξ Ἰ- 39
ωνάθαν καὶ Δαυίδ. Καὶ Ἰωνάθαν ἔδωκε τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὸ 40
παιδάριον αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπε τῷ παιδαρίῳ αὐτοῦ· πορεύου (καὶ) εἴ-

**CHAPTER 20. FIRST BOOK OF KINGDOMS.**

**26** [It was] towards to be, because he had not cleansed himself. And it came to pass on the morrow of the month, on the second day, that the place of David was empty.
**27** And Saul spake unto Jonathan his son, saying, "Wherefore hath the son of Jesse not come unto the table, neither yesterday nor today?"
**28** And Jonathan answered Saul and said unto him, "David besought me that he might go unto Bethlehem, his city.
**29** And he said, 'Send me, I pray thee, for there is a sacrifice of our tribe in the city, and my brother hath enjoined me. And now, if I have found grace in thy sight, I shall be delivered and shall see my brethren.' For this cause hath he not come unto the king's table."

**30** Then Saul's wrath was kindled against Jonathan exceedingly, and he said unto him, "Thou son of rebellious women! Do I not know that thou art a partner with the son of Jesse unto thine own shame, and unto the shame of thy mother's [very] nakedness?
**31** For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the earth, thy kingdom shall not be established. Now therefore, send and fetch the youth unto me, for he is a son of death!"
**32** And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, "Wherefore should he die? What hath he done?"
**33** And Saul lifted up his spear against Jonathan to slay him. Then Jonathan knew that this evil, to slay David, was consummated by his father.
**34** And Jonathan sprang from the table in fierce anger, and ate no bread on the second day of the month; for he was grieved for David, because his father had resolved [upon] his destruction.
**35** And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field, as David had appointed, for the testimony. And a small lad was with him.
**36** And he said unto the lad, "Run, find me the arrows which I shoot." And the lad ran, and he himself shot the arrow, and sent it beyond him.
**37** And the lad came unto the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot.
**38** And Jonathan cried out after the young man, and said, "Behold, the arrow is beyond thee, and farther on!" And Jonathan cried out after his lad, saying, "Hasten, make speed, and stand not still!" And the lad gathered up Jonathan's arrows and brought the arrows unto his master.
**39** But the lad knew nothing, save Jonathan and David [only].
**40** And Jonathan gave his weapons unto his lad, and said unto his lad, "Go, (and) enter into the city."
**41** And the lad went in, and David arose...
