ματα ταῦτα, καὶ εὐθύνθη ὁ λόγος ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς Δαυὶδ ἐπιγαμ-

καὶ ἐπλήρωσεν αὐτὰς τῷ βασιλεῖ, καὶ ἐπιγαμβρεύεται τῷ βασιλεῖ,
καὶ δίδωσιν αὐτῷ Σαοὺλ τὴν Μελχὰλ θυγατέρα αὐτοῦ αὐτῷ εἰς
γυναῖκα. Καὶ ἴδε Σαοὺλ καὶ ἔγνω ὅτι Κύριος μετὰ Δαυὶδ, καὶ 28

ΚΑὶ ἐλάλησε Σαοὺλ πρὸς Ἰωνάθαν τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ καὶ πρὸς 1
πάντας τοὺς παῖδας αὐτοῦ θανατῶσαι τὸν Δαυὶδ, καὶ Ἰωνάθαν ὁ 2
υἱὸς Σαοὺλ ἠρᾶτο τὸν Δαυὶδ σφόδρα, καὶ ἀπήγγειλεν Ἰωνάθαν τῷ
Δαυὶδ, λέγων· Ζητεῖ Σαοὺλ ὁ πατήρ μου θανατῶσαί σε· φύλαξαι
οὖν αὔριον πρωΐ, καὶ κρύβηθι καὶ κάθισον κρυφῇ, καὶ ἐγὼ ἐξε- 3
λεύσομαι, καὶ στήσομαι ἐχόμενος τοῦ πατρός μου ἐν ἀγρῷ οὗ ἐὰν
ᾖς ἐκεῖ· καὶ ἐγὼ λαλήσω περὶ σοῦ πρὸς τὸν πατέρα μου, καὶ ὄ-
ψομαι ὅ,τι ἐὰν ᾖ, καὶ ἀπαγγελῶ σοι. Καὶ ἐλάλησεν Ἰωνάθαν πε- 4
ρὶ Δαυὶδ ἀγαθὰ πρὸς Σαοὺλ τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς
αὐτόν· μὴ ἁμαρτησάτω ὁ βασιλεὺς εἰς τὸν δοῦλόν σου Δαυὶδ, ὅτι
οὐχ ἡμάρτηκεν εἰς σὲ, καὶ τὰ ποιήματα αὐτοῦ ἀγαθά σοι σφόδρα,
καὶ ἐθέτο τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπάταξε τὸν 5
ἀλλόφυλον, καὶ ἐποίησε Κύριος σωτηρίαν μεγάλην, καὶ πᾶς Ἰσ-

θανατῶσαι τὸν Δαυὶδ δωρεάν; Καὶ ἤκουσε Σαοὺλ τῆς φωνῆς Ἰω- 6

ἐκάλεσεν Ἰωνάθαν τὸν Δαυὶδ, καὶ ἀπήγγειλεν αὐτῷ Ἰωνάθαν πάν-

**Chapter 18**

26 Philistines. And Saul's servants reported these words unto David; and the saying was right in the eyes of David, that he should become son-in-law unto the king.
27 And it came to pass, that before the days were fully expired, David rose up, and he went forth, he and his men, and smote among the Philistines [many] men; and he brought their foreskins, and he rendered them in full unto the king. So he became son-in-law unto the king, and Saul gave unto him Michal his daughter unto him to wife.
28 And Saul saw and knew that the Lord was with David, and all Israel loved him.
29 And he added yet more to stand in awe of David. And Saul was an enemy unto David all the days [of his life].
38 And the princes of the Philistines went forth; and it came to pass, after a long while of their expeditions, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; and his name was greatly held in honour.

**Chapter 19**

1 Now Saul spoke unto Jonathan his son, and unto all his servants, to put David to death.
2 And Jonathan, Saul's son, did greatly curse David; and Jonathan reported unto David, saying, "Saul my father seeketh to put thee to death. Therefore, be thou on thy guard on the morrow morn, and hide thyself and sit in secret.
3 And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou shalt be; and I will speak of thee unto my father, and I will see what [may come to pass], and I will report unto thee."
4 And Jonathan spoke good things concerning David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, "Let not the king sin against his servant David, for he hath not sinned against thee, and his works have been exceeding good unto thee.
5 For he put his life in his hand, and smote the Philistine, and the Lord wrought a great salvation [for Israel]; and all Israel saw it, and they rejoiced. And wherefore dost thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?"
6 And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan, and Saul swore, saying, "As the Lord liveth, he shall not die."
7 And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan reported unto him all these words; and Jonathan brought David unto Saul, and he was in his presence as in times past.
8 And it came to pass that the war continued to be, and David prevailed, and [ye] did fight the Philistines.
