ΚΕΦ. ΙΘʹ. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Δʹ.
34 γραφήσεται, καὶ τὴν πόλιν ταύτην οὐκ εἰσελεύσεται, λέγει Κύριος.
35 καὶ ὑπερασπιῶ ὑπὲρ τῆς πόλεως ταύτης τοῦ σῶσαι αὐτὴν διὰ μὲ,
36 καὶ διὰ Δαυΐδ τὸν δοῦλόν μου. Καὶ ἐγένετο (ἕως) νυκτός, καὶ
   ἐξῆλθεν ἄγγελος Κυρίου, καὶ ἐπάταξεν ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ τῶν
   ᾿Ασσυρίων ἑκατὸν ὀγδοήκοντα πέντε χιλιάδας· καὶ ὥρθρισαν τὸ
   πρωΐ, καὶ ἰδοὺ πάντες σώματα νεκρά. Καὶ ἀπῆρε, καὶ ἐπορεύθη,
   καὶ ἀπέστρεψε Σενναχηρείμ βασιλεὺς ᾿Ασσυρίων, καὶ ᾤκησεν ἐν
37 Νινεϋ. Καὶ ἐγένετο αὐτοῦ προσκυνοῦντος ἐν οἴκῳ Νεσερὰχ τοῦ
   θεοῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ᾿Αδραμέλεχ, καὶ Σαρασὰρ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ ἐπάταξαν
   αὐτὸν ἐν μαχαίρᾳ. Καὶ αὐτοὶ διεσώθησαν εἰς γῆν ᾿Αραράθ· καὶ
   ἐβασίλευσεν ᾿Ασορδὰν υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. Κ΄. ΧΧ.

1 ἘΝ ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις ἠρρώστησεν ᾿Εζεκίας εἰς θάνατον·
   καὶ εἰσῆλθε πρὸς αὐτὸν Ἡσαΐας, υἱὸς Ἄμμως, ὁ προφήτης, καὶ
   εἶπε πρὸς αὐτόν· τάδε λέγει Κύριος· ἔντειλαι τῷ οἴκῳ σου, ὅτι
2 ἀποθνήσκεις σύ, καὶ οὐ ζήσῃ. Καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν ᾿Εζεκίας πρὸς τὸν
3 τοῖχον, καὶ ηὔξατο πρὸς Κύριον, λέγων· ὢ δὴ, Κύριε, μνήσθητι δὴ
   ὅσα περιεπάτησα ἐνώπιόν σου ἐν ἀληθείᾳ, καὶ ἐν καρδίᾳ πλήρει,
   καὶ τὸ ἀγαθὸν ἐνώπιόν σου ἐποίησα. Καὶ ἔκλαυσεν ᾿Εζεκίας
4 κλαυθμῷ μεγάλῳ. Καὶ ἦν Ἡσαΐας ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ τῇ μέσῃ, καὶ
5 ῥῆμα Κυρίου ἐγένετο πρὸς αὐτόν, λέγων· ἐπίστρεφον, καὶ
   ἐρεῖς πρὸς ᾿Εζεκίαν τὸν ἡγούμενον τοῦ λαοῦ μου· τάδε λέγει
   Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Δαυΐδ τοῦ πατρός σου· ἤκουσα τῆς προσευχῆς σου,
   εἶδον τὰ δάκρυά σου· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἰάσομαί σε, ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τρίτῃ
6 οἶκον Κυρίου. Καὶ προσθήσω ἐπὶ ταῖς ἡμέραις σου πεντεκαίδεκα
   ἔτη· καὶ ἐκ χειρὸς βασιλέως ᾿Ασσυρίων σώσω σε, καὶ τὴν πόλιν
   ταύτην, καὶ ὑπερασπιῶ ὑπὲρ τῆς πόλεως ταύτης διὰ μὲ, καὶ διὰ
7 Δαυΐδ τὸν δοῦλόν μου. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἡσαΐας· λαβέτωσαν παλάθην
   σύκων, (καὶ ἐλήφθη) καὶ ἐπιθέτωσαν ἐπὶ τὸ ἕλκος, καὶ ὑγιάσει.
8 Καὶ εἶπεν ᾿Εζεκίας πρὸς Ἡσαΐαν· τί τὸ σημεῖον ὅτι ἰάσεται
   Κύριός με, καὶ ἀναβήσομαι εἰς τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ
9 τρίτῃ; Καὶ εἶπεν Ἡσαΐας· τοῦτο τὸ σημεῖον παρὰ Κυρίου, ὅτι
   ποιήσει Κύριος τὸν λόγον, ὃν ἐλάλησε· πορεύσεται ἡ σκιὰ δέκα
   ἀναβαθμούς, ἐὰν ἐπιστρέψῃ δέκα

### Literary Translation:

### 2 Kings 19

**34** It shall be written, and into this city shall he not come," saith the LORD.
**35** "And I will shield this city, to save it for My sake,
**36** and for David My servant's sake." And it came to pass, [even] until night, that the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand; and when they rose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses. So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went, and returned, and dwelt in
**37** Nineveh. And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer, his sons, smote him with the sword; and they themselves escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon, his son, reigned in his stead.

### 2 Kings 20

**1** Now in those days, Hezekiah was sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, came unto him, and said unto him, "Thus saith the LORD: 'Set thine house in order, for
**2** thou shalt die, and not live.'" And Hezekiah turned his face to the
**3** wall, and prayed unto the LORD, saying, 'O now, LORD, remember, I beseech Thee, how I have walked before Thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in Thy sight.' And Hezekiah wept
**4** with great lamentation. And Isaiah was [still] in the middle court, and
**5** the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, 'Turn again, and tell Hezekiah, the leader of My people, "Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father: I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears; behold, I will heal thee, and on the third day shalt thou go up to the
**6** house of the LORD. And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will save thee and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will shield this city for My sake, and for
**7** David My servant's sake."' Then Isaiah said, 'Let them take a cake of figs.' (And it was taken.) 'And let them lay it upon the boil, and he shall recover.'"
**8** And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, 'What shall be the sign that the LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of the LORD on the
**9** third day?' And Isaiah said, 'This is the sign from the LORD, that the LORD will perform the word which He hath spoken: "Shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or shall it return ten [degrees]?"'
