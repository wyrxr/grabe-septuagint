ἐν τῇ ἀπωλείᾳ τῆς πατρίδος μου·
7 Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἐσθὴρ τῇ βασιλίσσῃ, καὶ Μαρδοχαίῳ τῷ Ἰουδαίῳ· εἰ πάντα τὰ ὑπάρχοντα Ἀμὰν ἐχαρισάμην σοι, καὶ αὐτὸν ἐκρέμασα ἐπὶ τοῦ ξύλου, ὅτι τὰς χεῖρας ἐπήνεγκε τοῖς Ἰουδαίοις, τί ἔτι ἐπιζητεῖς;
8 Γράφετε καὶ ὑμεῖς ἐκ τοῦ ὀνόματός μου, ὡς δοκεῖ ὑμῖν, καὶ σφραγίσατε τῷ δακτυλίῳ μου· ὅσα γὰρ γράφεται τοῦ βασιλέως ἐπιτάξαντος, καὶ σφραγισθῇ τῷ δακτυλίῳ μου, οὐκ ἔστιν αὐτοῖς ἀντειπεῖν.
9 Ἐκλήθησαν δὲ οἱ γραμματεῖς ἐν τῷ πρώτῳ μηνὶ, ὅς ἐστι Νισὰ, τρίτῃ καὶ εἰκάδι τοῦ αὐτοῦ μηνὸς, καὶ ἐγράφη τοῖς Ἰουδαίοις, ὅσα ἐνετείλατο τοῖς οἰκονόμοις καὶ τοῖς ἄρχουσι τῶν σατραπῶν, ἀπὸ τῆς Ἰνδικῆς ἕως τῆς Αἰθιοπίας ἑκατὸν εἴκοσι καὶ ἑπτὰ σατραπείαις κατὰ χώραν καὶ χώραν, κατὰ τὴν αὐτῶν λέξιν.
10 Καὶ ἐγράφη διὰ τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ ἐσφραγίσθη τῷ δακτυλίῳ αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐξαπέστειλε τὰ γράμματα διὰ βιβλιαφόρων, ὡς ἐπέταξεν αὐτοῖς χρήσασθαι τοῖς νόμοις αὐτῶν ἐν πάσῃ τῇ πόλει.
11 Βοηθῆσαί τε αὐτοῖς, καὶ χρῆσθαι τοῖς ἀντιδίκοις αὐτῶν καὶ τοῖς ἀντικειμένοις αὐτῶν, ὡς βούλονται, ἐν ἡμέρᾳ μιᾷ ἐν πάσῃ τῇ βασιλείᾳ Ἀρταξέρξου,
12 Τῇ τρισκαιδεκάτῃ τοῦ δωδεκάτου μηνὸς, ὅς ἐστιν Ἀδάρ.
13 Ὧν ἐστιν ἀντίγραφον τῆς ἐπισολῆς τὰ ὑπογεγραμμένα: Βασιλεὺς μέγας Ἀρταξέρξης τοῖς ἀπὸ τῆς Ἰνδικῆς ἕως τῆς Αἰθιοπίας ἑκατὸν εἴκοσι καὶ ἑπτὰ σατραπείαις χωρῶν ἄρχουσι, καὶ σατράπαις τοῖς τὰ ἡμέτερα φρονοῦσι, χαίρειν. Πολλοὶ τῇ πλείστῃ τῶν εὐεργετούντων χρηστότητι πυκνότερον τιμώμενοι μεῖζον ἐφρόνησαν, καὶ οὐ μόνον τοὺς ὑποτεταγμένους ἡμῖν ζητοῦσι κακοποιεῖν, τόν τε κόρον οὐ δυνάμενοι φέρειν, καὶ τοῖς ἑαυτῶν εὐεργέταις ἐπιχειροῦσι μηχανᾶσθαι· καὶ (κατὰ) τὴν εὐχαριστίαν οὐ μόνον ἐκ τῶν ἀνθρώπων ἀνταναιροῦντες, ἀλλὰ καὶ τοῖς τῶν ἀπειραγάθων κόμποις ἐπαρθέντες, τοῦ τὰ πάντα κατοπτεύοντος ἀεὶ Θεοῦ μισοπόνηρον διαλαμβάνουσιν ἐκφεύξασθαι δίκην. Πολλάκις δὲ καὶ πολλοὺς τῶν ἐπ’ ἐξουσίαις τεταγμένων τῶν πιστευθέντων χειρίζειν φίλων τὰ πράγματα, παραμυθία μεταιτίους αἱμάτων ἀθώων καταστήσασα περιέβαλε συμφοραῖς ἀνηκέστοις, τῷ τῆς κακοηθείας ψευδεῖ παραλογισμῷ παραλογισαμένων τὴν τῶν ἐπικρατούντων ἀκέραιον εὐγνωμοσύνην. Σκοπεῖν δὲ ἔξεστιν, οὐ τοσοῦτον ἐκ τῶν παλαιοτέρων ὡς παρεδώκαμεν ἱστοριῶν, ὅσα ἐστὶ παρὰ πόδας ὑμᾶς ἐκζητοῦντας ἀνοσίως συντετελεσμένα τῇ τῶν ἀναξίᾳ δυναστευόντων

...in the destruction of my country?

7 Then the king said unto Esther the queen, and unto Mordecai the Jew, "If all the possessions of Haman I have bestowed upon thee, and him I have hanged upon the tree, because he laid his hands upon the Jews, what further dost thou seek?"

8 "Write ye also, as it seemeth good unto you, in my name, and seal it with my ring; for whatsoever is written by the king's commandment, and sealed with my ring, there is no gainsaying it."

9 Then were the scribes called in the first month, which is Nisan, on the three and twentieth day of the same month. And it was written unto the Jews, whatsoever he commanded unto the stewards and unto the rulers of the satrapies, from India even unto Ethiopia, to one hundred and twenty-seven satrapies, province by province, according to their own language.

10 And it was written by the king, and sealed with his ring; and he sent forth the letters by couriers, as he commanded, that they should make use of their laws throughout every city.

11 And that they should render aid unto them, and deal with their adversaries and their enemies, as they shall desire, on one day throughout all the kingdom of Artaxerxes,

12 On the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is Adar.

13 Of which the copy of the epistle is as follows: King Artaxerxes the Great, to the rulers of the one hundred and twenty-seven satrapies of lands from India even unto Ethiopia, and to the satraps who are well-disposed towards our affairs, greetings. Many, being more frequently honored by the exceeding goodness of their benefactors, have grown proud beyond measure; and not only seek they to do evil unto those subject unto us, being unable to bear the satiety [of their blessings], but they even attempt to devise plots against their own benefactors; and [with respect to] gratitude, not only annulling the same from among men, but also, being puffed up by the vain boasts of those ignorant of good, they imagine that they shall escape the judgment of God, Who ever beholdeth all things and hateth wickedness. And oftentimes, hath [ill] counsel, making many of those placed in authority (who were entrusted as friends to administer affairs) accomplices in innocent blood, encompassed them with incurable misfortunes, because they, by the false reasoning of maliciousness, did deceive the unblemished goodwill of those who wielded power. And it is possible to discern, not so much from the elder histories which we have delivered unto you, as what hath been unholily wrought before your very eyes—as ye inquire—by the destructive [pestilence] of those who hold dominion unworthily,
