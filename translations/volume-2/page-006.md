11 Ἀδωναΐ Κύριε Ἐλωαΐ σαβαὼθ, ἐὰν ἐπιβλέπων ἐπιβλέψῃς ἐπὶ τὴν
ταπείνωσιν τῆς δούλης σου, καὶ μνησθῇς μου, καὶ μὴ ἐπιλάθῃς
τῆς δούλης σου, καὶ δῷς τῇ δούλῃ σου σπέρμα ἀνδρῶν, καὶ δώ-
σω αὐτὸν ἐνώπιόν σου ἕως ἡμέρας θανάτου αὐτοῦ· καὶ οἶ-
νον καὶ μέθυσμα οὐ μὴ πίεται, καὶ σίδηρος οὐκ ἀναβήσεται ἐπὶ
12 τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐγενήθη ὅτε ἐπλήθυνε προσευχομένη
ἐνώπιον Κυρίου, καὶ Ἡλεὶ ὁ ἱερεὺς ἐφύλαξε τὸ στόμα αὐτῆς. Καὶ
13 Ἄννα αὕτη ἐλάλει ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτῆς, πλὴν τὰ χείλη αὐτῆς ἐκί-
νεῖτο, καὶ φωνὴ αὐτῆς οὐκ ἠκούετο· καὶ ἐλογίσατο αὐτὴν Ἡλεὶ
14 εἰς μεθύουσαν. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ τὸ παιδάριον Ἡλεὶ· ἕως πότε
μεθυσθήσῃ; περιελοῦ τὸν οἶνόν σου ἀπὸ σοῦ, καὶ πορεύου ἐκ προ-
15 σώπου Κυρίου. Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Ἄννα, καὶ εἶπεν· οὐχὶ κύριέ μου·
γυνὴ ἡ σκληρὰ ἡμέρα ἐγώ εἰμι, καὶ οἶνον καὶ μέθυσμα οὐ πέ-
16 πωκα, καὶ ἐκχέω ἐνώπιον Κυρίου τὴν ψυχήν μου· μὴ δῷς τὴν
δούλην σου εἰς θυγατέρα λοιμὴν, ὅτι ἐκ πλήθους ἀδολεσχίας μου
καὶ ἀθυμίας μου ἐκτέτακα ἕως νῦν. Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Ἡλεὶ, καὶ
17 εἶπεν αὐτῇ· πορεύου εἰς εἰρήνην, ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραὴλ δῴη σοι πᾶν αἴ-
τημά σου, ὃ ᾐτήσω παρ’ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπεν· εὕροι ἡ δούλη σου
18 χάριν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς σου. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἡ γυνὴ εἰς τὴν ἔδδον αὐ-
τῆς, καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸ κατάλυμα αὐτῆς· καὶ ἔφαγε μετὰ τοῦ
ἀνδρὸς αὐτῆς καὶ ἔπιε, καὶ τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτῆς οὐ συνέπεσεν ἔτι.
19 Καὶ ὀρθρίζουσι τοπρωΐ, καὶ προσκυνοῦσι τῷ Κυρίῳ, καὶ πορεύον-
ται (καὶ ἦλθον) τὴν ἔδδον αὐτῶν. Καὶ εἰσῆλθεν Ἑλκανὰ εἰς τὸν
οἶκον αὐτοῦ Ἀρμαθαΐμ, καὶ ἔγνω Ἑλκανὰ τὴν Ἄνναν γυναῖκα
20 αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐμνήσθη αὐτῆς Κύριος. Καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐν τῷ καιρῷ
τῶν ἡμερῶν, καὶ συνέλαβεν Ἄννα, καὶ ἔτεκεν υἱὸν, καὶ ἐκάλεσε
τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ, Σαμουήλ· καὶ εἶπεν· ὅτι παρὰ Κυρίου Θεοῦ
21 σαβαὼθ ᾐτησάμην αὐτόν. Καὶ ἀνέβη ὁ ἄνθρωπος Ἑλκανὰ καὶ
πᾶς ὁ οἶκος αὐτοῦ θῦσαι ἐν Σηλὼ τὴν θυσίαν τῶν ἡμερῶν, καὶ
22 τὰς εὐχὰς αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάσας τὰς δεκάτας τῆς γῆς αὐτοῦ. Καὶ
Ἄννα οὐκ ἀνέβη μετ’ αὐτοῦ, ὅτι εἶπε τῷ ἀνδρὶ αὐτῆς· ἕως τοῦ
ἀναθῆναι τὸ παιδάριον, ἐὰν ἀπογαλακτίσω αὐτὸ, καὶ ὀφθήσεται
23 τῷ προσώπῳ Κυρίου, καὶ καθήσεται ἐκεῖ ἕως αἰῶνος. Καὶ εἶ-
πεν αὐτῇ Ἑλκανὰ ὁ ἀνὴρ αὐτῆς· ποίει τὸ ἀγαθὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς
σου, κάθου ἕως οὗ ἀπογαλακτίσῃς αὐτό· ἀλλὰ στήσαι Κύριος τὸ
ἐξελθὸν ἐκ τοῦ στόματός σου. Καὶ ἐκάθισεν ἡ γυνὴ, καὶ ἐθήλασε

**Chapter 1**

11 O Lord Adonai, Eloi Sabaoth, if Thou wilt indeed look upon the low estate of Thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget Thine handmaid, but wilt grant unto Thine handmaid a male child, then will I dedicate him unto Thee all the days of his life, even until the day of his death; and no wine nor strong drink shall he drink, and no razor shall come upon his head.

12 And it came to pass, when she continued long in prayer before the Lord, that Eli the priest watched her mouth.

13 Now Anna, she spake in her heart; only her lips did move, but her voice was not heard. And Eli deemed her to be drunken.

14 And the boy Eli said unto her, "How long wilt thou be drunken? Put away thy wine from thee, and depart from the presence of the Lord."

15 And Anna answered and said, "Nay, my lord, I am a woman [of] a hard day; and wine nor strong drink have I not drunk, but have poured out my soul before the Lord.

16 Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial; for out of the abundance of my anxious speech and my deep despondency have I uttered [my plea] until now."

17 Then Eli answered and said unto her, "Go in peace; the God of Israel grant thee all thy petition, which thou hast asked of Him."

18 And she said, "May thy handmaid find grace in thy sight." So the woman went into her dwelling, and entered into her lodging; and she did eat with her husband and did drink, and her countenance was no longer fallen.

19 And they rose up early in the morning, and worshipped before the Lord, and went (and came) unto their dwelling. And Elkanah went into his house at Ramathaim, and Elkanah knew Anna his wife;

20 and the Lord remembered her. And it came to pass in the due season, that Anna conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Samuel; for she said, "From the Lord God of Sabaoth have I asked him."

21 And the man Elkanah went up with all his house to offer in Shiloh the sacrifice of the days, and his vows, and all the tithes of his land.

22 But Anna went not up with him; for she said unto her husband, "Until the child be dedicated, when I have weaned him, then shall he appear before the face of the Lord, and he shall remain there forever."

23 And Elkanah her husband said unto her, "Do that which is good in thine own eyes; tarry until thou hast weaned him. But may the Lord establish that which hath gone out of thy mouth." So the woman tarried, and she nursed
