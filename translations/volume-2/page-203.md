ΚΕΦ. Θʹ. Γʹ. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Δʹ. 679
τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ, ἐν πόλει Δαυΐδ. Καὶ ἐν ἔτει ἑνδεκάτῳ (υἱοῦ) 29
Ἰωρὰμ υἱοῦ ᾿Αχαάβ, βασιλέως Ἰσραήλ, ἐβασίλευσεν Ὀχοζίας ἐπὶ
Ἰούδαν. Καὶ ἦλθεν Ἰηοῦ εἰς Ἰεζράελ· καὶ Ἰεζάβελ ἤκουσε, καὶ 30
ἐστίβισατο τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτῆς, καὶ ἠγάδυνε τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτῆς,
καὶ διέκυψε διὰ τῆς θυρίδος. Καὶ Ἰηοῦ εἰσεπορεύετο ἐν τῇ πόλει· 31
καὶ εἶπεν, ἡ εἰρήνη Ζαμβρί, ὁ φονευτὴς τοῦ κυρίου αὐτοῦ; Καὶ 32
ἐπῆρε τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ εἰς τὴν θυρίδα, καὶ εἶπε· τίς εἶ σύ;
κατάβηθι μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ. καὶ κατέκυψαν πρὸς αὐτὸν τρεῖς εὐνοῦχοι. Καὶ 33
εἶπε· κυλίσατε αὐτήν· καὶ ἐκύλισαν αὐτήν, καὶ ἐῤῥαντίσθη τοῦ αἵ-
ματος αὐτῆς πρὸς τὸν τοῖχον, καὶ πρὸς τοὺς ἵππους, καὶ συν-
επάτησαν αὐτήν· Καὶ εἰσῆλθε, καὶ ἔφαγε, καὶ ἔπιε, καὶ εἶπεν· 34
ἐπισκέψασθε δὴ τὴν κατηραμένην ταύτην, καὶ θάψατε αὐτήν, ὅτι
θυγάτηρ βασιλέως ἐστί. Καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν θάψαι αὐτήν, καὶ οὐχ 35
εὗρον ἐν αὐτῇ ἄλλο τι ἢ τὸ κρανίον, καὶ οἱ πόδες, καὶ τὰ ἴχνη
τῶν χειρῶν. Καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν, καὶ ἀνήγγειλαν αὐτῷ, καὶ εἶπε· λό- 36
γος Κυρίου ὃν ἐλάλησεν ἐν χειρὶ Ἡλιοῦ τοῦ Θεσβίτου, λέγων· ἐν
τῇ μερίδι Ἰεζράελ καταφάγονται οἱ κύνες τὰς σάρκας Ἰεζάβελ.
Καὶ ἔσται τὸ θνησιμαῖον Ἰεζάβελ ὡς κοπρία ἐπὶ προσώπου τοῦ 
ἀγροῦ ἐν τῇ μερίδι Ἰεζράελ, ὥστε μὴ εἰπεῖν αὐτούς, Ἰεζάβελ.

ΚΕΦ. Ιʹ. Χ.

ΚΑΙ τῷ ᾿Αχαὰβ ἑβδομήκοντα υἱοὶ ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ. καὶ ἔγραψεν 1
Ἰηοῦ βιβλίον, καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ πρὸς τοὺς ἄρχοντᾶς
Σαμαρείας, πρὸς τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους, καὶ πρὸς τοὺς τιθηνοὺς ᾿Α-
χαάβ, λέγων· Καὶ νῦν ὡς ἂν ἔλθῃ τὸ βιβλίον τοῦτο πρὸς ὑμᾶς, 2
καὶ μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ κυρίου ὑμῶν, καὶ μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν τὸ ἅρμα,
καὶ οἱ ἵπποι, καὶ αἱ πόλεις ἰσχυραί, καὶ τὰ ὅπλα. Καὶ ὄψεσθε τὸν 3
ἀγαθόν, καὶ τὸν εὐθῆ ἐν τοῖς υἱοῖς τοῦ κυρίου ὑμῶν, καὶ καταστή-
σετε αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὸν θρόνον τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ πολεμεῖτε ὑπὲρ
τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ κυρίου ὑμῶν. Καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν σφόδρα σφόδρα, καὶ 4
εἶπον· Ἰδοὺ οἱ δύο βασιλεῖς οὐκ ἔστησαν κατὰ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ,
καὶ πῶς στησόμεθα ἡμεῖς αὐτοί; Καὶ ἀπέστειλαν οἱ ἐπὶ τοῦ οἴ- 5
κου, καὶ οἱ ἐπὶ τῆς πόλεως, καὶ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι, καὶ οἱ τιθηνοὶ
πρὸς Ἰηοῦ, λέγοντες· παῖδες σου ἡμεῖς αὐτοί, καὶ ὅσα ἐὰν εἴπῃς
πρὸς ἡμᾶς ποιήσομεν, οὐ βασιλεύσομεν ἄνδρα, τὸ ἀγαθὸν ἐν
ὀφθαλμοῖς σου ποιήσομεν. Καὶ ἔγραφε πρὸς αὐτοὺς βιβλίον δεύ- 6
τερον, λέγων· εἰ ἐμοὶ ὑμεῖς, καὶ τῆς φωνῆς μου ὑμεῖς εἰσακούετε,
λάβετε τὴν κεφαλὴν ἀνδρῶν τῶν υἱῶν τοῦ κυρίου ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐνέγ-
κατε πρὸς μέ, ὡς ἡ ὥρα αὔριον, εἰς ᾿Ιεζράελ. Καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ
βασιλέως ἦσαν ἑβδομήντα ἄνδρες, οὗτοι ἄδροι τῆς πόλεως ἐξέ-
τρεφον αὐτούς. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἦλθε τὸ βιβλίον πρὸς αὐτοὺς, καὶ 7
ἔλαβον τοὺς υἱοὺς τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ ἔσφαξαν ἑβδομήντα ἄνδρας,
καὶ ἔθηκαν τὰς κεφαλὰς αὐτῶν ἐν καρτάλλοις, καὶ ἀπέστειλαν
αὐτὰς πρὸς αὐτὸν εἰς ᾿Ιεζράελ. Καὶ ἦλθεν ὁ ἄγγελος, καὶ ἀπήγ- 8
γειλε, λέγων· ἤνεγκαν τὰς κεφαλὰς τῶν υἱῶν τοῦ βασιλέως. καὶ
εἶπε· θέτε αὐτὰς βουνοὺς δύο παρὰ τὴν θύραν τῆς πόλεως εἰς
πρωΐ. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν πρωΐᾳ, καὶ ἐξῆλθε, καὶ ἔστη, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς 9
πάντα τὸν λαόν· δίκαιοι ὑμεῖς, ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ εἰμι συνεστράφην ἐπὶ τὸν
κύριόν μου, καὶ ἀπέκτεινα αὐτόν. Καὶ τίς ἐπάταξε πάντας τούτους;
Ἴδετε ἀφφῶ, ὅτι οὐ πεσεῖται ἀπὸ τοῦ ῥήματος Κυρίου, εἰς τὴν 10
γῆν, οὗ ἐλάλησε Κύριος ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον ᾿Αχαάβ. Καὶ Κύριος ἐποίη- 11
σεν ὅσα ἐλάλησεν ἐν χειρὶ δούλου αὐτοῦ ᾿Ηλιοῦ. Καὶ ἐπάταξεν
᾿Ιηοῦ πάνταʹς τοὺς ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ ᾿Αχαὰβ καταλειφθέντας ἐν τῷ ᾿Ιεζ-
ράελ, καὶ πάνταʹς τοὺς ἁδροὺς αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοὺς γνωστάʹς αὐτοῦ,
καὶ τοὺς ἱερεῖς αὐτοῦ, ὥστε μὴ καταλιπεῖν αὐτοῦ κατάλειμμα.
Καὶ ἀνέστη, καὶ ἦλθε, καὶ ἐπορεύθη εἰς Σαμάρειαν, αὐτὸς ἐν Βαι- 12
θακάδ τῶν ποιμένων ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ. Καὶ ᾿Ιηοῦ εὗρε τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς 13
᾿Οχοζίου βασιλέως ᾿Ιούδα, καὶ εἶπε· τίνες ὑμεῖς; καὶ εἶπον· οἱ
ἀδελφοὶ ᾿Οχοζίου ἡμεῖς, καὶ κατέβημεν εἰς εἰρήνην τῶν υἱῶν τοῦ
βασιλέως. καὶ τῶν υἱῶν τῆς δυναστευούσης. Καὶ εἶπε· συλλάβετε 14
αὐτοὺς ζῶντας. Καὶ συνελάβοντο αὐτοὺς ζῶντας, καὶ ἔσφαξαν αὐ-
τοὺς εἰς Βαιθακάδ, τεσσαράκοντα καὶ δύο ἄνδρας· οὐ κατέλιπεν
ἄνδρα ἐξ αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἐκεῖθεν, καὶ εὗρε τὸν ᾿Ιωναδὰβ υἱὸν 15
Ῥηχὰβ εἰς ἀπάντησιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ εὐλόγησεν αὐτόν. καὶ εἶπε πρὸς
αὐτὸν ᾿Ιηοῦ· εἰ ἔστι (μετὰ σοῦ) καρδία σου εὐθεῖα, καθὼς ἡ καρδία
μου μετὰ τῆς καρδίας σου; καὶ εἶπεν ᾿Ιωναδάβ· ἔστιν. καὶ εἶπεν
᾿Ιηοῦ· καὶ εἰ ἔστι, δὸς τὴν χεῖρά σου. καὶ ἔδωκε τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ·
καὶ ἀνεβίβασεν αὐτὸν πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὸ ἅρμα, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὑ- 16
τὸν· δεῦρο μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ, καὶ ἴδε ἐν τῷ ζηλῶσαί με τῷ Κυρίῳ· καὶ
ἐπεκάθισεν αὐτὸν ἐν τῷ ἅρματι αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς Σαμά- 17
ρειαν, καὶ ἐπάταξε πάνταʹς τοὺς καταλειφθέντας τοῦ ᾿Αχαὰβ ἐν

**Free and Highly Literary Translation:**

**29** [the sepulchre] of his fathers, in the city of David. And in the eleventh year of [the reign of] Joram, the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Ahaziah began to reign over Judah.

**30** And when Jehu was come into Jezreel, Jezebel heard [of it]; and she painted her eyes, and adorned her head, and looked forth through the window.

**31** And as Jehu entered into the city, she said, "Is it peace, Zimri, thou murderer of thy master?"

**32** And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, "Who art thou? Come down with me." And there bowed down unto him three eunuchs.

**33** And he said, "Cast her down!" So they cast her down; and her blood was spattered upon the wall and upon the horses, and they trampled her underfoot.

**34** And when he had gone in, and had eaten and drunk, he said, "Go, look upon this accursed woman, and bury her; for she is a king's daughter."

**35** And they went to bury her, but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.

**36** And they returned, and told him. And he said, "This is the word of the LORD, which He spake by the hand of Elijah the Tishbite, saying: 'In the portion of Jezreel shall the dogs devour the flesh of Jezebel.'

**37** And the corpse of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel, so that none shall say, 'This is Jezebel.'"

### Chapter 10

**1** Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote a letter, and sent it to Samaria, unto the rulers of Samaria, and to the elders, and to the guardians of Ahab, saying:

**2** "Now therefore, when this letter shall come unto you, and with you are the sons of your master, and with you are the chariots, and the horses, and the strong cities, and the weapons:

**3** Then look ye out the best and most upright among the sons of your master, and set him upon his father's throne, and fight ye for the house of your master."

**4** But they were exceedingly greatly afraid, and said, "Behold, the two kings stood not before him; and how then shall we ourselves stand?"

**5** And they that were over the house, and they that were over the city, and the elders, and the guardians, sent unto Jehu, saying, "We are thy servants, and whatsoever thou shalt say unto us, that will we do; we will not make any man king. We will do that which is good in

**6** [thy] sight." Then he wrote a second letter unto them, saying, "If ye be for me, and if ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the heads of the sons of your master, and bring them unto me by this hour tomorrow to Jezreel." Now the king's sons were seventy men, [and] these chief men of the city brought them up.

**7** And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and slew seventy men, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them to him to Jezreel.

**8** And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, "They have brought the heads of the king's sons." And he said, "Lay ye them in two heaps by the entrance of the city until the morning."

**9** And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said unto all the people, "Ye are righteous. Behold, I am; I conspired against my master, and slew him. But who hath smitten all these?

**10** Know ye now, that there shall not fall to the ground one word of the LORD, which the LORD spake concerning the house of Ahab.

**11** And the LORD hath done whatsoever He spake by the hand of His servant Elijah. And Jehu smote all them that were left of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his chief men, and his kinsfolk, and his priests, until he left him no remnant.

**12** And he arose, and departed, and went to Samaria, [and he was] at Beth-eked of the Shepherds on the way.

**13** And Jehu found the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, "Who are ye?" And they answered, "We are the brethren of Ahaziah, and we are come down to greet the sons of the king, and the sons of the ruling queen."

**14** And he said, "Take them alive." So they took them alive, and slew them at Beth-eked, forty and two men; he left not a single man of them.

**15** And when he had departed thence, he found Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him; and he blessed him. And Jehu said unto him, "If thine heart be upright (with thee), as my heart is with thy heart?" And Jehonadab answered, "It is." Then Jehu said, "And if it be, give me thine hand." And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot, and he said unto him,

**16** "Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD."

**17** So he made him sit in his chariot, and he came into Samaria, and smote all that remained unto Ahab in
