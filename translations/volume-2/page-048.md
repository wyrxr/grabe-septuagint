νέστη ἀπὸ τοῦ ὕπνου, καὶ ἔπεσεν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν
γῆν, καὶ προσεκύνησεν αὐτῷ τρίς, καὶ κατεφίλησεν ἕκαστος τὸν
πλησίον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔκλαυσεν ἕκαστος τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ, ἕως συντελείας
42 μεγάλης. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰωνάθαν τῷ Δαυΐδ· πορεύου εἰς εἰ-
ρήνην, καὶ ὡς ὁμωμόκαμεν ἀμφότεροι ἡμεῖς ἐν ὀνόματι Κυρίου
λέγοντες· Κύριος ἔσται μάρτυς ἀναμέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ σοῦ, καὶ ἀνα-
μέσον τοῦ σπέρματός μου, καὶ ἀναμέσον τοῦ σπέρματός σου, ἕως
43 αἰῶνος. Καὶ ἀνέστη Δαυὶδ καὶ ἀπῆλθε, καὶ Ἰωνάθαν εἰσῆλθεν
εἰς τὴν πόλιν.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΑ΄. ΧΧΙ.

1 ΚΑΙ ἔρχεται Δαυὶδ εἰς Νοβὰ πρὸς Ἀβιμέλεχ τὸν ἱερέα· καὶ
ἐξέστη Ἀβιμέλεχ τῇ ἀπαντήσει αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· τί ὅτι σὺ
2 μόνος, καὶ οὐδεὶς μετὰ σοῦ; Καὶ εἶπε Δαυὶδ τῷ Ἀβιμέλεχ, τῷ
ἱερεῖ· ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐντέταλταί μοι σήμερον ῥῆμα, καὶ εἶπέ μοι μὴ
γνώτω μηδεὶς τὸ ῥῆμα περὶ οὗ ἐγὼ ἀποστέλλω σε· καὶ ὑπὲρ οὗ ἐντέλ-
λομαί σοι καὶ τοῖς παιδαρίοις διαμεμαρτύρημαι ἐν τῷ τόπῳ τῷ λεγομέ-
3 νῳ, Θεοῦ πίστις Φελωνὶ Ἀλμωνί. Καὶ νῦν εἰ εἰσὶν ὑπὸ τὴν χεῖρά σου
4 πέντε ἄρτοι, δὸς εἰς χεῖράς μου τὸ εὑρεθέν. Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη ὁ ἱερεὺς τῷ
Δαυίδ, καὶ εἶπεν· οὐκ εἰσὶν ἄρτοι βέβηλοι ὑπὸ τὴν χεῖρά μου,
ὅτι ἀλλ᾿ ἡ ἄρτος ἅγιός ἐστιν· εἰ πεφυλαγμένα τὰ παιδία εἰσὶ
5 πλὴν ἀπὸ γυναικός, καὶ φάγεται. Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Δαυὶδ τῷ ἱερεῖ,
καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· ἀλλὰ ἀπὸ γυναικὸς ἀπεσχήμεθα ἐχθὲς καὶ τρί-
την ἡμέραν· ἐν τῷ ἐξελθεῖν με εἰς ὁδὸν γέγονε πάντα τὰ παι-
δάρια ἡγιασμένα, καὶ αὕτη ἡ ὁδὸς βέβηλος, διότι ἁγιασθήσεται
6 σήμερον διὰ τὰ σκεύη μου. Καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ Ἀβιμέλεχ ὁ ἱε-
ρεὺς τοὺς ἄρτους τῆς προθέσεως, ὅτι οὐκ ἦν ἐκεῖ ἄρτος, (ὅτι)
ἀλλ᾿ ἡ ἄρτοι τοῦ προσώπου οἱ ἀφηρημένοι ἐκ προσώπου Κυρίου,
7 τοῦ παρατεθῆναι ἄρτον θερμὸν ᾗ ἡμέρᾳ ἔλαβεν αὐτούς. Καὶ ἐκεῖ
ἦν εἷς τῶν παιδαρίων τοῦ Σαοὺλ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ συνεγόμε-
νος Νεσσαρὰν ἐνώπιον Κυρίου, καὶ ὄνομα αὐτῷ Δωὴκ ὁ Σύρος
8 νέμων τὰς ἡμιόνους Σαούλ. Καὶ εἶπε Δαυὶδ πρὸς Ἀβιμέλεχ·
ἰδὲ εἰ ἔστιν ἐνταῦθα ὑπὸ τὴν χεῖρά σου δόρυ, ἢ ῥομφαία, ὅτι τὴν
ῥομφαίαν μου καὶ τὰ σκεύη μου οὐκ εἴληφα ἐν τῇ χειρί μου, ὅτι
9 ἦν τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦ βασιλέως κατασπεῦδον. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ ἱερεύς· ἰδοὺ

**CHAPTER 20. FIRST BOOK OF KINGDOMS.**

**41** [Then David] arose from his sleep and fell upon his face unto the earth, and bowed himself three times. And each kissed his neighbor, and each wept over his neighbor, until there was a great consummation [of sorrow].
**42** And Jonathan said unto David, "Go in peace; and as we both have sworn, we, in the Name of the Lord, saying, 'The Lord shall be a witness betwixt me and thee, and betwixt my seed and betwixt thy seed, for evermore.'"
**43** And David arose and departed, and Jonathan entered into the city.

**CHAPTER 21.**

**1** And David came to Nob unto Ahimelech the priest; and Ahimelech trembled at his coming, and said unto him, "Wherefore art thou alone, and no man with thee?"
**2** And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, "The king hath laid a command upon me this day, and he said unto me, 'Let no man know this matter concerning which I send thee.' And that concerning which I have charged thee and the lads, I have made a solemn declaration in the place that is called, 'God's Faith Pheloni Almoni.'"
**3** "And now, if there be five loaves under thy hand, give into my hands that which may be found."
**4** And the priest answered David and said, "There are no common loaves under my hand; but the bread is holy. If the lads have kept themselves from women, then may he eat."
**5** And David answered the priest and said unto him, "But we have abstained from women yesterday and the day before yesterday. When I went forth upon my journey, all the lads were sanctified; and this way is indeed profane, because it shall be sanctified this day by my vessels."
**6** And Ahimelech the priest gave him the loaves of the Presence, for there was no bread there, (but) only the loaves of the Presence which had been removed from before the Lord, that hot bread might be set forth on the very day he took them.
**7** And there was one of the servants of Saul in that day, detained, even Nesaran, before the Lord; and his name was Doeg the Syrian, who tended the mules of Saul.
**8** And David said unto Ahimelech, "Behold, is there here under thy hand a spear or a sword? For I have not taken my sword and my equipment in my hand, because the king's business was urgent."
**9** And the priest said, "Behold,
