καὶ αὐτὸς ἐξήγειρε τὸ δόρυ αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τριακοσίους τραυματίας.
Καὶ αὐτῷ ὄνομα ἐν τοῖς τρισίν, ἐκ τῶν τριῶν ἐκείνων ἔνδοξος, 19
καὶ ἐγένετο αὐτοῖς εἰς ἄρχοντα, καὶ ἕως τῶν τριῶν οὐκ ἦλθε.

αὐτὸς κατέβη, καὶ ἐπάταξε τὸν λέοντα ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ λάκκου ἐν
τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῆς χιόνος· αὐτὸς ἐπάταξε τὸν ἄνδρα τὸν Αἰγύπτιον, 21
ἄνδρα ὁρατόν, ἐν δὲ τῇ χειρὶ τοῦ Αἰγυπτίου δόρυ ὡς ξύλον δια-
ξάρας· καὶ κατέβη πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐν ῥάβδῳ, καὶ ἥρπασε τὸ δόρυ
ἐκ τῆς χειρὸς τοῦ Αἰγυπτίου, καὶ ἀπέκτεινεν αὐτὸν ἐν τῷ δόρα-
