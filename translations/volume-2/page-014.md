ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Α΄. ΚΕΦ. Ε΄. ς΄.
ρύνθη χεὶρ Κυρίου ἐπ᾿ ῎Αζωτον, καὶ ἐπήγαγεν αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἐξέ-
ζεσεν αὐτοῖς εἰς τὰς ἕδρας αὐτῶν, τῇ ῎Αζωτον καὶ τὰ ὅρια
αὐτῆς, καὶ μέσον τῆς χώρας αὐτῆς ἀνεφύησαν μύες· καὶ ἐγένετο
7 σύγχυσις θανάτου μεγάλη ἐν τῇ πόλει. Καὶ εἶδον οἱ ἄνδρες ᾿Αζώ-
του ὅτι οὕτως, καὶ λέγουσιν· ὅτι οὐ καθήσεται κιβωτὸς τοῦ Θεοῦ
Ἰσραὴλ μεθ᾿ ἡμῶν, ὅτι σκληρὰ χεὶρ αὐτοῦ ἐφ᾿ ἡμᾶς καὶ ἐπὶ Δαγὼν
8 θεὸν ἡμῶν. Καὶ ἀποστέλλουσι καὶ συνάγουσι πάντας τοὺς σατρά-
πας τῶν ἀλλοφύλων πρὸς αὐτούς, καὶ λέγουσι· τί ποιήσομεν τῇ
κιβωτῷ Θεοῦ Ἰσραήλ; Καὶ λέγουσιν οἱ Γεθθαῖοι· μετελθέτω κι-
βωτὸς τοῦ Θεοῦ πρὸς ἡμᾶς· καὶ μετῆλθεν ἡ κιβωτὸς τοῦ Θεοῦ
9 εἰς Γεθθά. Καὶ ἐγενήθη μετὰ τὸ μετελθεῖν αὐτήν, καὶ γίνεται
χεὶρ Κυρίου ἐν τῇ πόλει, τάραχος μέγας σφόδρα· καὶ ἐπάταξε
τοὺς ἄνδρας τῆς πόλεως ἀπὸ μικροῦ καὶ ἕως μεγάλου, καὶ ἐπά-
ταξεν αὐτοῖς εἰς τὰς ἕδρας αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐποίησαν οἱ Γεθθαῖοι
10 ἑαυτοῖς ἕδρας. Καὶ ἐξαποστέλλουσι τὴν κιβωτὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ εἰς
᾿Ασκάλωνα· καὶ ἐγενήθη ὡς εἰσῆλθε κιβωτὸς τοῦ Θεοῦ εἰς ᾿Α-
σκάλωνα, καὶ ἐβόησαν οἱ ᾿Ασκαλωνῖται, λέγοντες· τί ἀπεστρέψατε
τὴν κιβωτὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς ἡμᾶς, θανατῶσαι ἡμᾶς καὶ
11 τὸν λαὸν ἡμῶν; Καὶ ἀποστέλλουσι καὶ συνάγουσι πάντας τοὺς
σατράπας τῶν ἀλλοφύλων, καὶ εἶπαν· ἐξαποστείλατε τὴν κιβωτὸν
τοῦ Θεοῦ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ καθισάτω εἰς τὸν τόπον αὐτῆς, καὶ οὐ μὴ
θανατώσῃ ἡμᾶς καὶ τὸν λαὸν ἡμῶν· ὅτι ἐγενήθη σύγχυσις θανά-
του ἐν ὅλει τῇ πόλει βαρεῖα σφόδρα, ὡς εἰσῆλθε κιβωτὸς Θεοῦ
12 ἐκεῖ. Καὶ οἱ ζῶντες οἱ οὐκ ἀποθανόντες ἐπλήγησαν εἰς τὰς ἕδρας·
καὶ ἀνέβη ἡ κραυγὴ τῆς πόλεως εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν.

ΚΕΦ. ς΄. VI.

1 ΚΑΙ ἦν ἡ κιβωτὸς Κυρίου ἐν ἀγρῷ τῶν ἀλλοφύλων ἑπτὰ
2 μῆνας· καὶ ἐξέζεσεν ἡ γῆ αὐτῶν μύας. Καὶ καλοῦσιν ἀλλόφυλοι
τοὺς ἱερεῖς καὶ τοὺς μάντεις καὶ τοὺς ἐπαοιδοὺς αὐτῶν, λέγοντες·
τί ποιήσωμεν τῇ κιβωτῷ τοῦ Κυρίου; γνωρίσατε ἡμῖν, (καὶ) ἐν
3 τίνι ἀποστελοῦμεν αὐτὴν εἰς τὸν τόπον αὐτῆς; Καὶ εἶπον· εἰ ἐξα-
ποστέλλετε ὑμεῖς τὴν κιβωτὸν διαθήκης Κυρίου Θεοῦ Ἰσραήλ, μὴ
δὴ ἀποστείλητε αὐτὴν κενήν, ἀλλὰ ἀποδιδόντες ἀπόδοτε αὐτῇ τῆς
βασάνου, καὶ τότε ἰαθήσεσθε, καὶ ἐξιλασθήσεται ὑμῖν· Μὴ οὐκ

**Chapter 5**

6 ...was heavy upon Azotus, and He brought upon them, and caused to break out upon their secret parts, even in Azotus and its borders; and in the midst of their country did mice swarm forth. And there came to pass a great confusion of death in the city.

7 And when the men of Azotus saw that it was so, they said, "The Ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us, for His hand is heavy upon us and upon Dagon our god."

8 So they sent and gathered all the satraps of the Philistines unto them, and said, "What shall we do with the Ark of the God of Israel?" And the Gittites said, "Let the Ark of God pass over unto us." And the Ark of God passed over unto Gath.

9 And it came to pass, after it had been transferred, that the hand of the Lord was in the city, [causing] an exceeding great turmoil; and He smote the men of the city, from the least even unto the greatest, and smote them in their secret parts. And the Gittites had emerods upon them.

10 And they sent forth the Ark of God unto Ashkelon. And it came to pass, when the Ark of God entered into Ashkelon, that the Ashkelonites cried out, saying, "Why have ye turned back the Ark of the God of Israel unto us, to slay us and our people?"

11 And they sent and gathered all the satraps of the Philistines, and they said, "Send forth the Ark of the God of Israel, and let it rest in its own place, and it shall not slay us and our people; for there came to pass a confusion of death in the whole city, exceeding grievous, when the Ark of God entered there."

12 And those that lived, who had not died, were smitten in their secret parts; and the cry of the city ascended unto heaven.

**Chapter 6**

1 And the Ark of the Lord was in the country of the Philistines seven months.

2 And their land did swarm with mice. And the Philistines called for their priests and their diviners and their enchanters, saying, "What shall we do with the Ark of the Lord? Make known unto us, [and] wherewith shall we send it unto its place?"

3 And they said, "If ye send forth the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord God of Israel, ye shall by no means send it forth empty, but rendering [a recompense], ye shall render unto it a recompense for the affliction, and then shall ye be made whole, and it shall be atoned for you. Shall not His hand then depart from you?"
