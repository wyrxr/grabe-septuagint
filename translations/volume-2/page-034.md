Σαμουὴλ πρὸς Σαούλ· Οὐχὶ μικρὸς εἶ σὺ ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ ἡγούμενος σκήπτρου φυλῆς Ἰσραήλ; καὶ ἔχρισέ σε Κύριος εἰς βασιλέα ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ·
18 καὶ ἀπέστειλέ σε Κύριος ἐν ὁδῷ, καὶ εἶπέ σοι, Πορεύθητι, καὶ ἐξολόθρευσον τοὺς ἁμαρτάνοντας εἰς ἐμέ, τὸν Ἀμαλήκ, καὶ πολέμησις αὐτοὺς ἕως συντελέσεις αὐτούς· καὶ
19 ἵνα τί οὐκ ἤκουσας τῆς φωνῆς Κυρίου, ἀλλὰ ὥρμησας τοῦ θέσθαι ἐπὶ τὰ σκῦλα, καὶ ἐποίησας τὸ πονηρὸν ἐνώπιον Κυρίου;
20 Καὶ εἶπε Σαούλ πρὸς Σαμουήλ· Διὰ τὸ ἀκοῦσαί με τῆς φωνῆς τοῦ λαοῦ, καὶ ἐπορεύθην ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ ᾗ ἀπέσταλκέ με Κύριος, καὶ ἤγαγον τὸν Ἀγὰγ βασιλέα Ἀμαλήκ, καὶ τὸν Ἀμαλὴκ ἐξωλόθρευσα.
21 Καὶ ἔλαβεν ὁ λαὸς τῶν σκύλων ποίμνια καὶ βουκόλια, τὰ πρῶτα τοῦ ἐξολοθρεύματος θῦσαι ἐνώπιον Κυρίου Θεοῦ ἡμῶν ἐν Γαλγάλοις.
22 Καὶ εἶπε Σαμουήλ· Εἰ θελητὸν τῷ Κυρίῳ ὁλοκαυτώματα καὶ θυσίας ὡς τῷ ἀκοῦσαι φωνῆς Κυρίου; Ἰδοὺ ἀκοὴ ὑπὲρ θυσίαν ἀγαθήν,
23 καὶ ἡ ἐπακρόασις ὑπὲρ στέαρ χριῶν. Ὅτι ἁμαρτία οἰώνισμά ἐστιν, ὀδύνην καὶ πόνους θεραπεῖν ἐπάγουσιν· ὅτι ἐξουδένωσας τὸ ῥῆμα Κυρίου, καὶ ἐξουδενώσει σε Κύριος μὴ εἶναι βασιλέα ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ.
24 Καὶ εἶπε Σαούλ πρὸς Σαμουήλ· Ἡμάρτηκα, ὅτι παρέβην τὸν λόγον Κυρίου καὶ τὸ ῥῆμά σου, ὅτι ἐφοβήθην τὸν λαόν, καὶ ἤκουσα τῆς φωνῆς αὐτῶν.
25 Καὶ νῦν ἆρον δὴ τὸ ἁμάρτημά μου, καὶ ἀνάστρεφον μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ, καὶ προσκυνήσω Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ σου.
26 Καὶ εἶπε Σαμουὴλ πρὸς Σαούλ· Οὐχ ἀναστρέψω μετὰ σοῦ, ὅτι ἐξουδένωσας τὸ ῥῆμα Κυρίου, καὶ ἐξουδενώσει σε Κύριος τοῦ μὴ εἶναι βασιλέα ἐπὶ τὸν Ἰσραήλ.
27 Καὶ ἀπέστρεψε Σαμουὴλ τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ τοῦ ἀπελθεῖν, καὶ ἐκράτησε Σαοὺλ τοῦ πτερυγίου τῆς διπλοΐδος αὐτοῦ, καὶ διέρρηξεν αὐτό.
28 Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτὸν Σαμουήλ· Διέρρηξε Κύριος τὴν βασιλείαν σου ἀπὸ Ἰσραὴλ ἐκ χειρός σου σήμερον, καὶ δώσει αὐτὴν τῷ πλησίον σου τῷ ἀγαθῷ ὑπέρ σέ.
29 Καὶ διαιρεθήσεται Ἰσραὴλ εἰς δύο, καὶ οὐκ ἀποστρέψει, καὶ οὐ μετανοήσει, ὅτι οὐχ ὡς ἄνθρωπός ἐστι τοῦ μετανοῆσαι αὐτός.
30 Καὶ εἶπε Σαούλ· Ἡμάρτηκα, ἀλλὰ δόξασόν με δὴ ἐνώπιον πρεσβυτέρων λαοῦ μου καὶ ἐνώπιον Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἀνάστρεφον μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ, καὶ προσκυνήσω Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ σου.
31 Καὶ ἀνέστρεψε Σαμουὴλ ὀπίσω Σαούλ, καὶ προσεκύνησε Σαοὺλ τῷ Κυρίῳ.
32 Καὶ εἶπε Σαμουήλ· Προσαγάγετέ μοι τὸν Ἀγὰγ βασιλέα Ἀμαλήκ· καὶ προσῆλθε πρὸς αὐτὸν Ἀγὰγ τρέμων· καὶ εἶπεν Ἀγάγ· Εἰ

**1 Samuel 15**

...Samuel unto Saul: "Art thou not small in His sight, though [thou art] a leader of the sceptre of the tribe of Israel? And the LORD anointed thee king over Israel;
18 and the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said unto thee, 'Go, and utterly destroy them that sin against Me, [even] Amalek, and wage warfare against them until thou hast consumed them;' and
19 why then didst thou not hearken unto the voice of the LORD, but didst rush to lay hold upon the spoil, and didst commit that which is evil in the sight of the LORD?"
20 And Saul said unto Samuel, "Because I hearkened unto the voice of the people, and went in the way which the LORD sent me, and brought Agag the king of Amalek, and Amalek I utterly destroyed.
21 And the people took of the spoil, flocks and herds, the choicest of that which was to be utterly destroyed, to sacrifice before the LORD our God in Gilgal."
22 And Samuel said, "Is it pleasing unto the LORD, burnt offerings and sacrifices, as to hearken unto the voice of the LORD? Behold, obedience is better than sacrifice,
23 and attention [unto Him] than the fat of rams. For sin is [as] divination, and [it] bringeth forth pain and sorrows for [men] to heal; for thou hast spurned the word of the LORD, and the LORD shall spurn thee from being king over Israel."
24 And Saul said unto Samuel, "I have sinned, because I transgressed the word of the LORD and thy word, for I feared the people, and hearkened unto their voice.
25 And now, I pray thee, take away my sin, and return with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God."
26 And Samuel said unto Saul, "I will not return with thee, for thou hast spurned the word of the LORD, and the LORD shall spurn thee from being king over Israel."
27 And Samuel turned his face to go away, and Saul laid hold upon the skirt of his cloak, and tore it.
28 And Samuel said unto him, "The LORD hath torn the kingdom of Israel from thine hand this day, and shall give it to thy neighbor who is better than thou.
29 And Israel shall be divided into two, and He shall not turn back, neither shall He repent, for He is not as a man, that He should repent."
30 And Saul said, "I have sinned, but honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people and before Israel, and return with me, and I will worship the LORD thy God."
31 And Samuel turned back after Saul, and Saul worshipped the LORD.
32 And Samuel said, "Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of Amalek." And Agag came unto him trembling; and Agag said, "Is
