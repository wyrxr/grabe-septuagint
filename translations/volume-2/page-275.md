βῃ τοῦ στῆσαι θυσιαστήριον τῷ Κυρίῳ ἐν ἅλῳ Ὀρνὰ τοῦ Ἰεβουσαίου.
19 Καὶ ἀνέβη Δαυὶδ κατὰ τὸν λόγον Γάδ, ὃν ἐλάλησεν ἐν ὀνόματι Κυρίου.
20 Καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν Ὀρνά, καὶ εἶδε τὸν βασιλέα, καὶ τέσσαρες υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ κρυβόμενοι· καὶ Ὀρνὰ ἦν ἀλοῶν πυρούς.
21 Καὶ ἦλθε Δαυὶδ πρὸς Ὀρνά, καὶ Ὀρνὰ ἐξῆλθεν ἐκ τῆς ἅλω, καὶ προσεκύνησε τῷ Δαυὶδ τῷ προσώπῳ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν.
22 Καὶ εἶπε Δαυὶδ πρὸς Ὀρνά· δός μοι τὸν τόπον σου τῆς ἅλω, καὶ οἰκοδομήσω ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ θυσιαστήριον τῷ Κυρίῳ, ἐν ἀργυρίῳ ἀξίῳ δός μοι αὐτόν, καὶ παύσεται ἡ πληγὴ ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ.
23 Καὶ εἶπεν Ὀρνὰ πρὸς Δαυίδ· λάβε σεαυτῷ, καὶ ποιησάτω ὁ κύριός μου ὁ βασιλεὺς τὸ ἀγαθὸν ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ· ἰδοὺ δέδωκα τοὺς μόσχους εἰς ὁλοκαύτωσιν, καὶ τὸ ἄροτρον (καὶ τὰς ἁμάξας) εἰς ξύλα, καὶ τὸν σῖτον εἰς θυσίαν, τὰ πάντα ἔδωκα.
24 Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Δαυὶδ τῷ Ὀρνὰ· οὐχί, ὅτι ἀγοράζων ἀγοράσω ἐν ἀργυρίῳ ἀξίῳ, ὅτι οὐ μὴ λάβω ἃ ἐστί σοι Κυρίῳ, τοῦ ἀνενέγκαι (εἰς) ὁλοκαύτωσιν δωρεὰν Κυρίῳ.
25 Καὶ ἔδωκε Δαυὶδ τῷ Ὀρνὰ περὶ τοῦ τόπου αὐτοῦ σίκλους χρυσίου ὁλκῆς ἑξακοσίους.
26 Καὶ ᾠκοδόμησε Δαυὶδ ἐκεῖ θυσιαστήριον Κυρίῳ, καὶ ἀνήνεγκεν ὁλοκαυτώματα καὶ σωτηρίου, καὶ ἐβόησε πρὸς Κύριον, καὶ ἐπήκουσεν αὐτῷ ἐν πυρὶ ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον τῆς ὁλοκαυτώσεως, καὶ κατηνάλωσε τὴν ὁλοκαύτωσιν.
27 Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς τὸν ἄγγελον· καὶ καθῆκε τὴν ῥομφαίαν εἰς τὸν κολεὸν αὐτῆς,
28 ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ ἐν τῷ ἰδεῖν τὸν Δαυίδ, ὅτι εἰσήκουσεν αὐτῷ Κύριος ἐν ἅλῳ Ὀρνὰ τοῦ Ἰεβουσαίου, καὶ ἐθυσίασεν ἐκεῖ.
29 Καὶ σκηνὴ Κυρίου ἦν ἐποίησε Μωυσῆς ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, καὶ θυσιαστήριον τῶν ὁλοκαυτωμάτων ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ ἐν Βαμὰ τῇ ἐν Γαβαώνῃ.
30 Καὶ οὐκ ἠδύνατο Δαυὶδ τοῦ πορευθῆναι ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ τοῦ ζητῆσαι τὸν Θεόν, ὅτι κατέσπευσεν ἀπὸ προσώπου τῆς ῥομφαίας ἀγγέλου Κυρίου.

1 ΚΑΙ εἶπε Δαυίδ· οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ οἶκος Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ τοῦτο τὸ θυσιαστήριον εἰς ὁλοκαύτωσιν τῷ Ἰσραήλ.
2 Καὶ εἶπε Δαυὶδ συναγαγεῖν πάντας τοὺς προσηλύτους τοὺς ἐν γῇ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ κατέστησε λατόμους λατομῆσαι λίθους ξυστοὺς τοῦ οἰκοδομῆσαι οἶκον τῷ Θεῷ.
3 Καὶ σίδηρον πολὺν εἰς τοὺς ἥλους τῶν θυρωμάτων, καὶ τῶν πυλῶν, καὶ τοὺς στροφεῖς ἡτοίμασε Δαυίδ,

A free and highly literary translation:

**CHAPTER XXI. XXII.**
**OF THE KINGS OF JUDAH, I.**

**18** [to] go up, to set up an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.
**19** And David went up according to the word of Gad, which he spake in the Name of the LORD.
**20** And Ornan turned, and saw the king; and his four sons with him were hiding themselves. And Ornan was then threshing wheat.
**21** And David came unto Ornan; and Ornan went out from the threshingfloor, and bowed himself unto David with his face to the ground.
**22** Then David said unto Ornan, "Give me thy place of the threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the LORD. For a worthy price of silver give it me, and the plague shall cease from the people."
**23** And Ornan said unto David, "Take [it] unto thyself, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his sight. Lo, I have given the calves for a burnt offering, and the plough (and the carts) for wood, and the wheat for a meal offering; all these have I given."
**24** And King David said unto Ornan, "Nay; but I will surely buy it for a worthy price of silver, for I will not take that which is thine [to present] unto the LORD, that I should offer up a burnt offering freely unto the LORD."
**25** So David gave to Ornan for the place thereof six hundred shekels of gold by weight.
**26** And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and cried unto the LORD; and He heard him by fire from heaven upon the altar of the burnt offering, and consumed the burnt offering.
**27** And the LORD spake unto the Angel; and he sheathed his sword into its scabbard.
**28** In that time, when David saw that the LORD had heard him at the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, he sacrificed there.
**29** Now the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses had made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offerings, was at that time in Bamah, which is in Gibeon.
**30** But David could not go before it to seek God, for he was sore afraid because of the sword of the Angel of the LORD.

**CHAPTER XXII.**

**1** Then David said, "This is the House of the LORD God, and this is the altar for the burnt offering for Israel."
**2** And David commanded to gather all the sojourners that were in the land of Israel; and he set stonecutters to hew out hewn stones for the building of the House of God.
**3** And David prepared much iron for the nails of the doors and of the gates, and for the hinges thereof.
