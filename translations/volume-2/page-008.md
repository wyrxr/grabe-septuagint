χώμενος, συνιεῖν καὶ γινώσκειν τὸν Κύριον, καὶ ποιεῖν κρῖμα καὶ
δικαιοσύνην ἐν μέσῳ τῆς γῆς. Κύριος ἀνέβη εἰς οὐρανούς, καὶ ἐβρόντησεν·
αὐτὸς κρινεῖ ἄκρα γῆς, καὶ δίδωσιν ἰσχὺν τοῖς βασι-
11 λεῦσιν ἡμῶν, καὶ ὑψώσει κέρας χριστοῦ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ κατέλιπον
αὐτὸν ἐκεῖ ἐνώπιον Κυρίου, καὶ ἀπῆλθον εἰς Ἀρμαθαΐμ εἰς τὸν
οἶκον αὐτῶν· καὶ τὸ παιδάριον ἦν λειτουργῶν τῷ προσώπῳ Κυ-
12 ρίου ἐνώπιον Ἠλεὶ τοῦ ἱερέως. Καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Ἠλεὶ τοῦ ἱερέως
υἱοὶ λοιμοί, οὐκ εἰδότες τὸν Κύριον καὶ τὸ δικαίωμα τοῦ ἱερέως
13 παρὰ τοῦ λαοῦ παντὸς τοῦ θύοντος. Καὶ ἤρχετο τὸ παιδάριον
τοῦ ἱερέως ὡς ἂν ἡψηθῇ τὸ κρέας, καὶ κρεάγρα τριόδους ἐν τῇ
14 χειρὶ αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτὴν εἰς τὸν λουτῆρα, ἢ εἰς τὸν λέ-
βητα τὸν μέγαν, ἢ εἰς τὴν χύτραν, ἢ εἰς τὸ χαλκεῖον· πᾶν ὃ
ἐὰν ἀνέβῃ ἐν τῇ κρεάγρᾳ, ἐλάμβανεν ὁ ἱερεὺς ἑαυτῷ· κατὰ ταῦ-
τα δὲ ἐποίουν παντὶ Ἰσραήλ, τοῖς ἐρχομένοις θῦσαι Κυρίῳ ἐν
15 Σηλώ. Καὶ πρὶν θυμιαθῆναι τὸ στέαρ, ἤρχετο τὸ παιδάριον τοῦ
ἱερέως, καὶ ἔλεγε τῷ ἀνδρὶ τῷ θύοντι· δὸς κρέας ὀπτῆσαι τῷ
ἱερεῖ, καὶ οὐ μὴ λάβω παρὰ σοῦ κρέας ἑφθὸν ἐκ τοῦ λέβητος.
16 Καὶ ἔλεγεν ὁ ἄνθρωπος ὁ θύων· θυμιαθήτω πρῶτον ὡς καθήκει
τὸ στέαρ, καὶ λάβε σεαυτῷ ἐκ πάντων ὧν ἐπιθυμεῖ ἡ ψυχή σου·
Καὶ εἶπεν· οὐχὶ ὅτι νῦν δώσεις· καὶ ἐὰν μή, λήψομαι κραται-
17 ῶς. Καὶ ἦν ἡ ἁμαρτία τῶν παιδαρίων μεγάλη σφόδρα ἐνώπιον
18 Κυρίου, ὅτι ἠθέτουν τὴν θυσίαν Κυρίου. Καὶ Σαμουὴλ ἦν λει-
τουργῶν ἐνώπιον Κυρίου, παιδάριον περιεζωσμένον Ἐφούδ Βάδ.
19 Καὶ διπλοΐδα μικρὰν ἐποίησεν αὐτῷ ἡ μήτηρ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀνέφερεν
αὐτῷ ἐξ ἡμερῶν εἰς ἡμέρας, ἐν τῷ ἀναβαίνειν αὐτὴν μετὰ
20 τοῦ ἀνδρὸς αὐτῆς θῦσαι τὴν θυσίαν τῶν ἡμερῶν. Καὶ εὐλόγησεν
Ἠλεὶ τὸν Ἑλκανὰ καὶ τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ, λέγων· ἀποτίσαι
Κύριός σοι σπέρμα ἐκ τῆς γυναικὸς ταύτης, ἀντὶ τοῦ χρέους οὗ
ἐχρήσας τῷ Κυρίῳ. Καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ὁ ἄνθρωπος εἰς τὸν τόπον
21 αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐπεσκέψατο Κύριος τὴν Ἄνναν, καὶ συνέλαβε, καὶ ἔτεκεν
ἔτι τρεῖς υἱούς, καὶ δύο θυγατέρας· Καὶ ἐμεγαλύνθη τὸ
22 παιδάριον Σαμουὴλ ἐνώπιον Κυρίου. Καὶ Ἠλεὶ πρεσβύτης σφό-
δρα· καὶ ἤκουσε σύμπαντα ἃ ἐποίουν οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ τοῖς υἱοῖς
Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ὡς ἐκοίμιζον τὰς γυναῖκας τὰς παρεστώσας παρὰ
23 τὴν θύραν τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· ἱνατί
ποιεῖτε κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο ὃ ἐγὼ ἀκούω, ῥήματα πονηρά, ἐκ

**Chapter 2**

10 ...him that boasteth, that he understand and know the Lord, and do judgment and righteousness in the midst of the earth. The Lord hath ascended into the heavens, and hath thundered; He Himself shall judge the ends of the earth, and giveth strength unto our kings, and shall exalt the horn of His Christ.
11 And they left him there before the Lord, and departed unto Ramathaim, unto their own house: and the child did minister unto the presence of the Lord before Eli the priest.
12 Now the sons of Eli the priest were sons of worthlessness, knowing not the Lord, nor the rightful claim of the priest from all the people that offered sacrifice.
13 For the priest's servant would come, when the flesh was yet boiling, with a three-pronged fork in his hand;
14 and he would strike it into the laver, or into the great cauldron, or into the pot, or into the kettle; and whatsoever the fork brought up, the priest did take for himself. Thus did they do unto all Israel, to them that came to sacrifice unto the Lord in Shiloh.
15 And ere the fat was burnt, the priest's servant would come, and say unto the man that offered sacrifice, "Give flesh to roast for the priest, and I will not receive of thee boiled flesh out of the cauldron."
16 And the man that offered sacrifice would say, "Let the fat be burnt first, as it is meet, and then take unto thyself of all that thy soul desireth." And he would answer, "Nay, but thou shalt give it me now; and if thou wilt not, I will take it by force."
17 And the sin of the young men was very great before the Lord, for they scorned the sacrifice of the Lord.
18 But Samuel did minister before the Lord, being a child girded with a linen ephod.
19 Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she went up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.
20 And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, saying, "The Lord repay thee seed from this woman, for the loan which thou didst lend unto the Lord." And the man returned unto his own place.
21 And the Lord did visit Anna, so that she conceived and bore yet three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew great before the Lord.
22 Now Eli was very old, and he heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the Tabernacle of the Testimony.
23 And he said unto them, "Wherefore do ye such things, even this evil report which I hear from—"
