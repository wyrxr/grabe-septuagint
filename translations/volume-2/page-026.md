ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Α´. ΚΕΦ. ΙΒ´.
ἀλλ᾿ ἡ βασιλεὺς βασιλεύσει ἐφ᾿ ἡμῶν· καὶ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν
13 βασιλεὺς ὑμῶν. Καὶ νῦν ἰδοὺ ὁ βασιλεὺς ὃν ἐξελέξασθε, ὃν ἠ-
14 θήσασθε· καὶ ἰδοὺ δέδωκε Κύριος ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς βασιλέα. Ἐὰν φο-
βηθῆτε τὸν Κύριον, καὶ δουλεύσητε αὐτῷ, καὶ ἀκούσητε τῆς φω-
νῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ μὴ ἐρίσητε τῷ στόματι Κυρίου, καὶ ἦτε καὶ ὑμεῖς
15 μενοι· ἐὰν δὲ μὴ εἰσακούσητε τῆς φωνῆς Κυρίου καὶ ἐρίσητε
τῷ στόματι Κυρίου, καὶ ἔσται χεὶρ Κυρίου εἰς ὑμᾶς καὶ
16 ἐπὶ τὸν βασιλέα ὑμῶν. Καὶ νῦν κατάστητε, καὶ ἴδετε τὸ ῥῆμα
17 τὸ μέγα τοῦτο, ὃ ὁ Κύριος ποιήσει ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς ὑμῶν· οὐχὶ
θερισμὸς πυρῶν σήμερον; ἐπικαλέσομαι τὸν Κύριον, καὶ δώσει
φωνὰς καὶ ὑετόν, καὶ γνῶτε καὶ ἴδετε, ὅτι ἡ κακία ὑμῶν μεγά-
18 λη ἣν ἐποιήσατε ἐνώπιον Κυρίου αἰτήσαντες ἑαυτοῖς βασιλέα. Καὶ
ἐπεκαλέσατο Σαμουὴλ τὸν Κύριον, καὶ ἔδωκε Κύριος φωνὰς καὶ
ὑετὸν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ· καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν πᾶς ὁ λαὸς τὸν Κύ-
19 ριον σφόδρα καὶ τὸν Σαμουήλ. Καὶ εἶπαν πᾶς ὁ λαὸς πρὸς Σα-
μουὴλ· πρόσευξαι ὑπὲρ τῶν δούλων σου πρὸς Κύριον Θεόν σου,
καὶ οὐ μὴ ἀποθάνωμεν· ὅτι προστεθείκαμεν πρὸς πάσας τὰς
20 ἁμαρτίας ἡμῶν κακίαν, αἰτήσαντες ἑαυτοῖς βασιλέα. Καὶ εἶπε
Σαμουὴλ πρὸς τὸν λαόν· μὴ φοβεῖσθε· ὑμεῖς πεποιήκατε τὴν πᾶ-
σαν κακίαν ταύτην· πλὴν μὴ ἐκκλίνητε ἀπὸ ὀπίσω Κυρίου, καὶ
21 δουλεύσατε τῷ Κυρίῳ ἐν ὅλῃ καρδίᾳ ὑμῶν, καὶ μὴ παραβῆτε ὀ-
πίσω τῶν μηδὲν ὄντων, ἃ οὐ περανοῦσιν οὐδέν, καὶ οὐκ ἐξε-
22 λοῦνται, ὅτι οὐθέν εἰσιν· ὅτι οὐκ ἀπώσεται Κύριος τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ διὰ
τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ τὸ μέγα, ὅτι ἐπιεικῶς Κύριος προσελάβετο ὑμᾶς ἑαυτῷ
23 εἰς λαόν. Καὶ ἐμοὶ μηδαμῶς τοῦ ἁμαρτεῖν τῷ Κυρίῳ, ἀνιέναι τοῦ προ-
σεύχεσθαι περὶ ὑμῶν καὶ δουλεύσω τῷ Κυρίῳ, καὶ δείξω ὑμῖν
24 τὴν ὁδὸν τὴν ἀγαθὴν καὶ τὴν εὐθεῖαν. Πλὴν φοβεῖσθε τὸν Κύ-
ριον, καὶ δουλεύσατε αὐτῷ ἐν ἀληθείᾳ καὶ ἐν ὅλῃ καρδίᾳ ὑμῶν.
25 ὅτι ἴδετε ἃ ἐμεγάλυνε μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν. Καὶ ἐὰν κακία κακοποιήσητε,
καὶ ὑμεῖς καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς ὑμῶν προστεθήσεσθε.

12 Nay; but a king shall reign over us; and the LORD your God, He is your King.
13 And now, behold, the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have desired; and behold, the LORD hath set a king over you.
14 If ye shall fear the LORD, and serve Him, and hearken unto His voice, and rebel not against the mouth of the LORD, and ye yourselves be remaining;
15 But if ye shall not hearken unto the voice of the LORD, and rebel against the mouth of the LORD, then shall the hand of the LORD be against you and upon your king.
16 Now therefore, stand still, and see this great thing, which the LORD will do before your eyes;
17 Is it not wheat harvest today? I will call upon the LORD, and He shall send thunders and rain, and ye shall know and see, that your wickedness is great, which ye have wrought before the LORD, in asking for yourselves a king.
18 And Samuel called upon the LORD, and the LORD sent forth thunders and rain on that day; and all the people feared the LORD exceedingly, and Samuel.
19 And all the people said unto Samuel, "Pray for thy servants unto the LORD thy God, that we perish not; for we have added unto all our sins this evil, in asking for ourselves a king."
20 And Samuel said unto the people, "Fear not: ye have indeed wrought all this wickedness; yet turn ye not aside from following the LORD;
21 But serve the LORD with all your heart, and turn ye not aside after vain things, which are nothing, that cannot profit you aught, neither can they deliver; for they are naught.
22 For the LORD will not forsake His people for His great Name's sake; because it hath pleased the LORD to make you His own people.
23 Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you; but I will serve the LORD, and I will show you the good and the right way.
24 Only fear the LORD, and serve Him in truth with all your heart.
25 For consider what great things He hath done for you. But if ye shall still do wickedly, both ye and your king shall be consumed."
