518                               ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Αʹ.                  ΚΕΦ. ΙΗʹ.
10 πόμενος τὸν Δαυὶδ ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέρας ἐκείνης καὶ ἐπέκεινα. Καὶ
    ἐγενήθη ἀπὸ τῆς ἐπαύριον, καὶ ἔπεσε πνεῦμα Θεοῦ πονηρὸν
    ἐπὶ Σαούλ, καὶ προεφήτευσεν ἐν μέσῳ οἴκου αὐτοῦ. Καὶ Δαυὶδ
    ἔψαλλεν ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ ὡς καθ᾿ ἑκάστην ἡμέραν. Καὶ τὸ δόρυ
11 ἐν τῇ χειρὶ Σαούλ. Καὶ ἦρε Σαοὺλ τὸ δόρυ, καὶ εἶπε, πατά-
    ξω ἐν Δαυὶδ καὶ ἐν τῷ τοίχῳ. Καὶ ἐξέκλινε Δαυὶδ ἀπὸ προ-
12 σώπου αὐτοῦ δίς. Καὶ ἐφοβήθη Σαοὺλ ἀπὸ προσώπου Δαυίδ, ὅτι
13 ἦν Κύριος μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀπὸ Σαοὺλ ἀπέστη. Καὶ ἀπέστησεν
    αὐτὸν Σαοὺλ ἀφ᾿ αὑτοῦ, καὶ κατέστησεν αὐτὸν ἑαυτῷ χιλίαρχον.
14 Καὶ ἐξεπορεύετο καὶ εἰσεπορεύετο ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ λαοῦ. Καὶ ἦν Δαυὶδ
15 ἐν πάσαις ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὐτοῦ συνιῶν, καὶ Κύριος μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἴδε Σα-
    οὺλ ὡς αὐτὸς συνιεῖ σφόδρα, καὶ εὐλαβεῖτο ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ.
16 Καὶ πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ καὶ Ἰούδας ἠγάπα τὸν Δαυίδ, ὅτι αὐτὸς ἐξε-
17 πορεύετο καὶ εἰσεπορεύετο πρὸ προσώπου τοῦ λαοῦ. Καὶ εἶπε
    Σαοὺλ πρὸς Δαυίδ, ἰδοὺ ἡ θυγάτηρ μου ἡ μείζων Μερώβ, αὐτὴν
    δώσω σοι εἰς γυναῖκα, καὶ πλὴν γίνου μοι εἰς υἱὸν δυνάμεως, καὶ
    πολέμει τοὺς πολέμους Κυρίου. Καὶ Σαοὺλ εἶπε, μὴ ἔστω χεὶρ
18 μου ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ, καὶ ἔσται ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν χεὶρ ἀλλοφύλων. Καὶ εἶπεν
    Δαυὶδ πρὸς Σαούλ, τίς ἐγὼ εἰμι, καὶ τίς ἡ ζωὴ τῆς συγγενείας
    πατρός μου ἐν Ἰσραήλ, ὅτι ἔσομαι γαμβρὸς τοῦ βασιλέως;
19 Καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐν τῷ καιρῷ τοῦ δοῦναι τὴν Μερωβ θυγατέρα Σα-
    οὺλ τῷ Δαυίδ, καὶ αὕτη ἐδόθη τῷ ᾿Αδριὴλ τῷ Μοβυλαθίτῃ εἰς γυναῖκα.
20 Καὶ ἠγάπησε Μελχὸλ ἡ θυγάτηρ Σαοὺλ τὸν Δαυίδ, καὶ ἀπηγ-
21 γέλη Σαοῦλ, καὶ εὐθύνθη τὸ ῥῆμα ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶ-
    πε Σαούλ, Δώσω αὐτὴν αὐτῷ, καὶ ἔσται αὐτῷ εἰς σκάνδαλον.
22 Καὶ ἦν ἐπὶ Σαοὺλ χεὶρ ἀλλοφύλων. Καὶ εἶπε Σαοὺλ πρὸς τὸν
    Δαυίδ, ἐν ταῖς δυσὶν ἐπιγαμβρεύσεις μοι σήμερον. Καὶ ἐνετείλα-
    το Σαοὺλ τοῖς παισὶν αὑτοῦ, λέγων· λαλήσατε ὑμεῖς τὸν Δαυὶδ
    λάθρα, λέγοντες· Ἰδοὺ θέλει ἐν σοὶ ὁ βασιλεύς, καὶ πάντες οἱ παῖ-
23 δες αὐτοῦ ἀγαπῶσί σε, καὶ σὺ ἐπιγάμβρευσον τῷ βασιλεῖ. Καὶ
    ἐλάλησαν οἱ παῖδες Σαοὺλ εἰς τὰ ὦτα Δαυὶδ κατὰ τὰ ῥήματα
    ταῦτα. Καὶ εἶπε Δαυίδ, εἰς κοῦφον ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς ὑμῶν ἐπιγαμ-
24 βρεῦσαι βασιλεῖ; κἀγὼ ἄνθρωπος ταπεινός, καὶ οὐχὶ ἔνδοξος. Καὶ
    ἀπήγγειλαν οἱ παῖδες Σαοὺλ αὐτῷ κατὰ τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα, ἃ ἐ-
25 λάλησε Δαυίδ. Καὶ εἶπε Σαούλ, τάδε ἐρεῖτε τῷ Δαυίδ, οὐ βού-
    λεται ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐν δόματι, ἀλλ᾽ ἢ ἐν ἑκατὸν ἀκροβυστίαις ἀλλο-

10 eyed David from that day and onward. And it came to pass on the morrow, that an evil spirit from God fell upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of his house. And David played on his harp with his hand, as he was wont to do daily.
11 Now the spear was in Saul's hand. And Saul lifted up the spear, and said, "I will smite David, and even to the wall." But David swerved twice from his presence.
12 And Saul was afraid of David, because the Lord was with him, and had departed from Saul.
13 And Saul removed him from himself, and made him his captain over a thousand.
14 And David went forth and came in before the people.
15 And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways, and the Lord was with him. And Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, and he stood in awe of him.
16 And all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went forth and came in before the people.
17 Then Saul said unto David, "Behold, my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife; only be thou unto me a man of valour, and fight the battles of the Lord." (For Saul said within himself, "Let not my hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.")
18 And David said unto Saul, "Who am I? and what is the life of the family of my father in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?"
19 But it came to pass at the time when Merab, Saul's daughter, should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife.
20 And Michal, Saul's daughter, loved David; and it was told Saul, and the thing was pleasing in his eyes.
21 And Saul said, "I will give her to him, that she may be a snare unto him."
22 And the hand of the Philistines was upon Saul. And Saul said unto David, "By two [conditions] shalt thou be my son-in-law this day." And Saul commanded his servants, saying, "Speak ye to David secretly, saying, 'Behold, the king delighteth in thee, and all his servants love thee; therefore be thou the king's son-in-law.'"
23 And Saul's servants spoke these words in the ears of David. And David said, "Is it a light thing in your eyes to be a king's son-in-law? And I am a poor man, and not honorable."
24 And Saul's servants reported unto him these words, which David had spoken.
25 And Saul said, "Thus shall ye say to David, 'The king desireth not any dowry, but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines."
