ΚΕΦ. ΙΖ'. ΙΗ'. ΤΩΝ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ ΙΟΥΔΑ Β'. 791
βασιλείαν ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔδωκε πᾶς Ἰούδα δῶρα τῷ Ἰωσα- 6
φάτ, καὶ ἐγένετο αὐτῷ πλοῦτος καὶ δόξα πολλή. Καὶ ὑψώθη καρ-
δία αὐτοῦ ἐν ὁδῷ Κυρίου, καὶ ἔτι ἐξῆρε τὰ ὑψηλά, καὶ τὰ ἄλση
ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς Ἰούδα. Καὶ ἐν τῷ τρίτῳ ἔτει τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ, 7
ἀπέστειλε τοὺς ἡγουμένους ἑαυτοῦ, καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς τῶν δυνατῶν,
τὸν Ἀβδίαν, καὶ τὸν Ζαχαρίαν, καὶ τὸν Ναθαναήλ, καὶ Μιχαίαν,
τοῦ διδάσκειν ἐν πόλεσιν Ἰούδα. Καὶ μετ᾿ αὐτῶν οἱ Λευῖται, Σα- 8
μαΐας, καὶ Ναθανίας, καὶ Ζαβδίας, καὶ Ἀσιήλ, καὶ Σεμιραμώθ,
καὶ Ἰωνάθαν, καὶ Ἀδωνίας, καὶ Τωβίας, καὶ Τωβαδωνία, Λευῖ-
ται, καὶ οἱ μετ᾿ αὐτῶν, Ἐλισαμᾶ, καὶ Ἰωράμ, οἱ ἱερεῖς. Καὶ ἐδί- 9
δασκον ἐν Ἰούδα, καὶ μετ᾿ αὐτῶν βίβλος νόμου Κυρίου, καὶ διῆλ-
θον ἐν ταῖς πόλεσιν Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐδίδασκον τὸν λαόν. Καὶ ἐγένετο 10
ἔκστασις Κυρίου ἐπὶ πάσαις ταῖς βασιλείαις τῆς γῆς ταῖς κύκλῳ
Ἰούδα, καὶ οὐκ ἐπολέμουν πρὸς Ἰωσαφάτ. Καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ἀλλοφύ- 11
λων ἔφερον τῷ Ἰωσαφὰτ δῶρα, καὶ ἀργύριον, καὶ δόματα· καὶ οἱ
Ἄραβες ἔφερον αὐτῷ κριοὺς προβάτων ἑπτακισχιλίους ἑπτακοσίους,
τράγους ἑπτακισχιλίους ἑπτακοσίους. Καὶ ἦν Ἰωσαφὰτ πορευόμε- 12
νος μείζων ἕως εἰς ὕψος, καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν οἰκήσεις ἐν τῇ Ἰουδαίᾳ
καὶ πόλεις ὀχυράς, καὶ ἔργα πολλὰ ἐγένετο αὐτῷ ἐν τῇ Ἰουδαίᾳ· 13
καὶ ἄνδρες πολεμισταὶ δυνατοὶ ἰσχύοντες ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ οὗ- 14
τος ἀριθμὸς αὐτῶν κατ᾿ οἴκους πατριῶν αὐτῶν· καὶ τῷ Ἰούδα χι-
λίαρχοι, Ἕδνας ὁ ἄρχων, καὶ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ υἱοὶ δυνατοὶ δυνάμεως,
τριακόσιαι χιλιάδες· καὶ μετ᾿ αὐτὸν Ἰωνανὰν ὁ ἡγούμενος, καὶ μετ᾿ 15
αὐτοῦ διακόσιαι ὀγδοήκοντα χιλιάδες· καὶ μετ᾿ αὐτὸν Ἀμασίας ὁ 16
τοῦ Ζαχρί, ὁ προθυμούμενος τῷ Κυρίῳ, καὶ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ διακόσιαι
χιλιάδες, δυνατοὶ δυνάμεως. Καὶ ἐκ τοῦ Βενιαμεὶν δυνατὸς δυνά- 17
μεως Ἐλιαδά, καὶ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ τοξόται καὶ πελτασταί, διακόσιαι
χιλιάδες· καὶ μετ᾿ αὐτὸν Ἰωζαβάδ, καὶ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἑκατὸν ὀγδοή- 18
κοντα χιλιάδες, δυνατοὶ πολέμου. Οὗτοι οἱ λειτουργοῦντες τῷ βα- 19
σιλεῖ, ἐκτὸς ὧν δέδωκεν ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐν ταῖς πόλεσι ταῖς ὀχυραῖς ἐν
πάσῃ τῇ Ἰουδαίᾳ.

**Chapter 17**

⁵...the kingdom in his hand. And all Judah brought gifts unto Jehoshaphat; and there came unto him great riches and much glory.
⁶And his heart was uplifted in the way of the Lord. Moreover, he removed the high places and the groves from the land of Judah.
⁷And in the third year of his reign, he sent forth his princes, and the sons of the mighty, [even] Obadiah, and Zechariah, and Nathanael, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah.
⁸And with them were the Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobiah, and Tob-adonijah, [who were all] Levites; and with them, Elishama and Jehoram, the priests.
⁹And they taught in Judah, having with them the book of the law of the Lord; and they went throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught the people.
¹⁰And the dread of the Lord fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat.
¹¹And from the Philistines some brought presents unto Jehoshaphat, and silver for tribute. The Arabians also brought him seven thousand seven hundred rams of sheep, and seven thousand seven hundred male goats.
¹²And Jehoshaphat waxed mightier and mightier, even unto a high eminence [of power]. And he built fortresses in Judah and fortified cities; and many works were established by him throughout Judah.
¹³And he had men of war, mighty and valiant, in Jerusalem.
¹⁴And this is the number of them according to the houses of their fathers: Of Judah, the captains over thousands: Adnah the chief, and with him mighty men of valour, three hundred thousand.
¹⁵And next unto him was Jehohanan the commander, and with him two hundred and eighty thousand.
¹⁶And next unto him, Amasiah the son of Zichri, who gave himself willingly unto the Lord; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valour.
¹⁷And of Benjamin, Eliada, a mighty man of valour; and with him archers and shield-bearers, two hundred thousand.
¹⁸And next unto him, Jehozabad, and with him an hundred and eighty thousand, mighty in war.
¹⁹These were they who ministered unto the king, besides those whom the king had set in the fortified cities throughout all Judah.

**Chapter 18**

¹Now Jehoshaphat had great riches and much glory, and he made alliance by marriage with the house of Ahab.
²And after a lapse of years, he went down to Ahab in Samaria; and Ahab slew for him sheep and oxen in great abundance, and for the people who were with him. And, being fond of him, [he urged him] to go up with him to Ramoth-gilead.
