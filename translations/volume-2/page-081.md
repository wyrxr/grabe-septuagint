τοῦ δούλου σου εἰς μακράν· οὗτος δὲ ὁ νόμος τοῦ ἀνθρώπου,
Κύριέ μου, Κύριε. Καὶ τί προσθήσει Δαυὶδ ἔτι τοῦ λαλῆσαι πρὸς **20**
σέ; καὶ νῦν σὺ οἶδας τὸν δοῦλόν σου, Κύριέ μου Κύριε, καὶ διὰ
τὸν λόγον σου πεποίηκας, καὶ κατὰ τὴν καρδίαν σου ἐποίησας πᾶ- **21**
σαν τὴν μεγαλωσύνην σου ταύτην, γνωρίσαι τὸν δοῦλόν σου, ἕνε-
κεν τοῦ μεγαλυνθῆναί σε, Κύριε Κύριέ μου· ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν ὡς σύ, **22**
καὶ οὐκ ἔστι Θεὸς πλὴν σοῦ ἐν πᾶσιν οἷς ἠκούσαμεν ἐν τοῖς ὠ-
σὶν ἡμῶν. Καὶ τίς ὡς ὁ λαός σου Ἰσραὴλ ἔθνος ἄλλο ἐν τῇ γῇ; **23**
ὡς ὡδήγησεν αὐτὸν ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ λυτρώσασθαι αὐτῷ λαόν, τοῦ θέ-
σθαι σε ὄνομα, τοῦ ποιῆσαι μεγαλωσύνην καὶ ἐπιφάνειαν, τοῦ ἐκ-
βαλεῖν σε ἐκ προσώπου τοῦ λαοῦ σου, οὓς ἐλυτρώσω σεαυτῷ ἐξ
Αἰγύπτου, ἔθνη καὶ σκηνώματα. Καὶ ἡτοίμασας σεαυτῷ τὸν λα- **24**
όν σου Ἰσραὴλ εἰς λαὸν ἕως αἰῶνος, καὶ σύ, Κύριε, ἐγένου αὐτοῖς
εἰς Θεόν. Καὶ νῦν, Κύριέ μου, ῥῆμα ὃ ἐλάλησας περὶ τοῦ δού- **25**
λου σου καὶ τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ, πίστωσον ἕως αἰῶνος, καὶ ποίησον
καθὼς ἐλάλησας. Καὶ μεγαλυνθείη τὸ ὄνομά σου ἕως αἰῶνος, λέ- **26**
γων· Κύριος παντοκράτωρ Θεὸς ἐπὶ τὸν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ὁ οἶκος τοῦ
δούλου σου Δαυὶδ ἔσται ἀνωρθωμένος ἐνώπιόν σου. Ὅτι σὺ Κύ- **27**
ριε παντοκράτωρ ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, ἀπεκάλυψας τὸ ὠτίον τοῦ
δούλου σου, λέγων, Οἶκον οἰκοδομήσω σοι. Διὰ τοῦτο εὗρεν ὁ δοῦ-
λός σου τὴν καρδίαν ἑαυτοῦ τοῦ προσεύξασθαι πρὸς σὲ τὴν προς-
ευχὴν ταύτην. Καὶ νῦν, Κύριέ μου Κύριε, σὺ εἶ ὁ Θεός, καὶ οἱ **28**
λόγοι σου ἔσονται ἀληθινοί, καὶ ἐλάλησας ὑπὲρ τοῦ δούλου σου τὰ
ἀγαθὰ ταῦτα. Καὶ νῦν ἄρξαι καὶ εὐλόγησον τὸν οἶκον τοῦ δού- **29**
λου σου, τοῦ εἶναι εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα ἐνώπιόν σου, ἔτι σὺ (εἶ) Κύριέ
μου Κύριε ἐλάλησας, καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς εὐλογίας σου εὐλογηθήσεται ὁ
οἶκος τοῦ δούλου σου εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα.

**ΚΕΦ. Η'. VIII.**

**1** ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο μετὰ ταῦτα, καὶ ἐπάταξε Δαυὶδ τοὺς ἀλλοφύλους, καὶ ἐτροπώσατο αὐτούς. Καὶ ἔλαβε Δαυὶδ τὴν ἀφωρισμένην ἐκ χειρὸς τῶν ἀλλοφύλων.
**2** Καὶ ἐπάταξε Δαυὶδ τὴν Μωάβ, καὶ διεμέτρησεν αὐτοὺς ἐν σχοινίοις, κοιμίσας αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν. Καὶ ἐγένοντο τὰ δύο σχοινίσματα τοῦ θανατῶσαι, καὶ τὰ δύο σχοινίσματα ἐζώγρησαν· καὶ ἐγένετο Μωὰβ τῷ Δαυὶδ εἰς δούλους

### Chapter 7

...of Thy servant, for a long time to come; and is this the manner of man, O Lord, my Lord?
**20** And what shall David add yet to speak unto Thee? For now Thou knowest Thy servant, O Lord my Lord,
**21** and for Thy word hast Thou wrought, and according to Thine own heart hast Thou done all this Thy greatness, to make known Thy servant, for the sake of Thy being magnified, O Lord, my Lord;
**22** because there is none like Thee, and there is no God save Thee, in all things which we have heard with our ears.
**23** And who is like Thy people Israel, another nation on the earth? For God led him to redeem for Himself a people, to make for Thee a Name, to do greatness and manifestation, to cast *thee* out from the face of Thy people, whom Thou didst redeem for Thyself out of Egypt, [even from amidst] nations and [their] habitations.
**24** And Thou hast prepared for Thyself Thy people Israel to be a people unto the age, and Thou, O Lord, hast been to them God.
**25** And now, O my Lord, the word which Thou hast spoken concerning Thy servant and his house, confirm it unto the age, and do as Thou hast spoken.
**26** And let Thy Name be magnified unto the age, saying, 'The Lord Almighty God is over Israel,' and the house of Thy servant David shall be established before Thee.
**27** For Thou, O Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, hast uncovered the ear of Thy servant, saying, 'I will build a house for thee.' Therefore hath Thy servant found his heart to pray this prayer unto Thee.
**28** And now, O Lord my Lord, Thou art God, and Thy words shall be true, and Thou hast spoken concerning Thy servant these good things.
**29** And now begin and bless the house of Thy servant, that it may be unto the age before Thee; for Thou, O Lord my Lord, hast spoken it, and from Thy blessing shall the house of Thy servant be blessed unto the age.

**1** And it came to pass after these things, that David smote the Philistines, and routed them. And David took the set-apart [territory] from the hand of the Philistines.
**2** And David smote Moab, and he measured them with ropes, making them lie down upon the ground. And there were two lines for to kill, and two lines did they spare; and Moab became servants unto David,
