¹³ κρίσις ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ ἐτέθη γνώμη, ὅτι πᾶς ὁ ἐκουσιάζομενος ἐν βα-
σιλείᾳ μου ἀπὸ λαοῦ Ἰσραὴλ καὶ ἱερέων καὶ Λευιτῶν πορευθῆναι εἰς
¹⁴ Ἱερουσαλήμ, μετὰ σοῦ πορευθῆναι. Ἀπὸ προσώπου τοῦ βασι-
λέως καὶ τῶν ἑπτὰ συμβούλων ἀπεστάλη ἐπισκέψασθαι ἐπὶ τὴν
Ἰουδαίαν καὶ εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ νόμῳ Θεοῦ αὐτῶν τῷ ἐν χειρί σου.
¹⁵ Καὶ εἰς οἶκον Κυρίου ἀργύριον καὶ χρυσίον, ὃ ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ οἱ
σύμβουλοι ἐκουσίασθησαν τῷ Θεῷ τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ τῷ ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ
¹⁶ κατασκηνουντι. Καὶ πᾶν ἀργύριον καὶ χρυσίον, ὅ,τι ἂν εὕρῃς ἐν
πάσῃ χώρᾳ Βαβυλῶνος μετὰ ἐκουσιασμοῦ τοῦ λαοῦ, καὶ ἱερέων
¹⁷ τῶν ἐκουσιαζομένων εἰς οἶκον Θεοῦ τὸν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ πᾶν
προσπορευόμενον τοῦτο ἑτοίμως ἐνταζον ἐν βιβλίῳ τούτῳ, μό-
σχους, κριούς, ἀμνοῦς, καὶ θυσίας αὐτῶν, καὶ σπονδὰς αὐτῶν· καὶ
προσοίσεις αὐτὰ ἐπὶ θυσιαστηρίου τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ Θεοῦ ὑμῶν τοῦ ἐν
¹⁸ Ἱερουσαλήμ· καὶ εἴτι ἐπὶ σὲ καὶ τοὺς ἀδελφούς σου ἀγαθυνθῇ ἐν
καταλοίπῳ τοῦ ἀργυρίου καὶ χρυσίου ποιῆσαι, ὡς ἀρεσὸν τῷ Θεῷ
¹⁹ ὑμῶν ποιήσατε· καὶ τὰ σκεύη τὰ διδόμενά σοι εἰς λειτουργίαν οἴ-
²⁰ κου Θεοῦ παράδος ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ τὸ κα-
τάλοιπον χρείας οἴκου Θεοῦ σου, ὃ ἂν φανῇ σοι δοῦναι, δώσεις ἀπὸ
²¹ οἴκων γάζης βασιλέως, καὶ ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ· ἐγὼ Ἀρθασασθὰ βασιλεὺς
ἔθηκα γνώμην πάσαις ταῖς γάζαις ταῖς ἐν πέρα τοῦ ποταμοῦ, ὅτι
πᾶν ὃ ἐὰν αἰτήσει ὑμᾶς Ἔσρας ὁ ἱερεὺς καὶ γραμματεὺς τοῦ νόμου
²² τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, ἑτοίμως γιγνέσθω, ἕως ἀργυρίου ταλάν-
των ἑκατόν, καὶ ἕως πυροῦ κόρων ἑκατόν, καὶ ἕως οἴνου βατῶν
ἑκατόν, καὶ ἕως ἐλαίου βατῶν ἑκατόν, καὶ ἅλας οὐ οὐκ ἔστι γρα-
²³ φή. Πᾶν ὃ ἐστιν ἐν γνώμῃ τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, γιγνέσθω· προσ-
έχετε μή τις ἐπιχειρήσῃ εἰς οἶκον τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, μή ποτε
γένηται ὀργὴ ἐπὶ τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ τῶν υἱῶν αὐ-
²⁴ τοῦ.) Καὶ ὑμῖν ἐγνώρισται ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς ἱερεῦσι, καὶ τοῖς Λευίταις,
ᾄδουσι, πυλωροῖς, Ναθινείμ, καὶ λειτουργοῖς οἴκου Θεοῦ τοῦτο, φό-
²⁵ ροις μὴ ἔστω σοι, οὐκ ἐξουσιάσεις καταδουλῦσθαι αὐτούς. Καὶ σὺ
Ἔζρα, ὡς ἡ σοφία τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡ ἐν χειρί σου, κατάστησον γραμ-
ματεῖς καὶ κριτάς, ἵνα ὦσι κρίνοντες παντὶ τῷ λαῷ τῷ ἐν πέρα
τοῦ ποταμοῦ πᾶσι τοῖς εἰδόσι νόμον τοῦ Θεοῦ σου, καὶ τῷ μὴ εἰδό-
²⁶ τι γνωρίειτε. Καὶ πᾶς ὃς ἂν μὴ ᾖ ποιῶν τὸν νόμον τοῦ Θεοῦ καὶ
νόμον τοῦ βασιλέως ἑτοίμως, τὸ κρίμα ἔσται γιγνόμενον ἐξ αὑ-
τοῦ, ἐάν τε εἰς θάνατον, ἐάν τε εἰς παιδείαν, ἐάν τε εἰς ζημίαν τοῦ

¹³ [And] the judgment from me hath been set as a decree, That whosoever of the people of Israel, and of the priests, and of the Levites, in my kingdom, doth volunteer to go unto Jerusalem, may go with thee.
¹⁴ From before the king and his seven counselors, hath it been sent, that inquiry be made concerning Judea and Jerusalem, according to the Law of their God which is in thy hand.
¹⁵ And for the House of the Lord, silver and gold, which the king and his counselors have freely offered unto the God of Israel, Who dwelleth in Jerusalem.
¹⁶ And all the silver and gold, whatsoever thou shalt find in all the province of Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people, and of the priests who willingly offer themselves for the House of God which is in Jerusalem.
¹⁷ And all this which is offered, readily record in this book: calves, rams, lambs, and their sacrifices, and their drink offerings. And thou shalt bring them upon the altar of the House of your God, which is in Jerusalem.
¹⁸ And whatsoever shall seem good unto thee and thy brethren to do with the remainder of the silver and gold, that do ye, as it is pleasing unto your God.
¹⁹ And the vessels that are given thee for the service of the House of God, deliver them before God in Jerusalem.
²⁰ And whatsoever more shall be needful for the House of thy God, which it shall seem good to thee to give, thou shalt give it from the treasuries of the king's house,
²¹ and from me. I, Artaxerxes the king, have made a decree to all the treasuries that are beyond the River, that whatsoever Ezra the priest and scribe of the Law of the God of Heaven shall ask of you,
²² be done forthwith, even unto an hundred talents of silver, and unto an hundred cors of wheat, and unto an hundred baths of wine, and unto an hundred baths of oil, and salt without [any] written limit.
²³ All that is in the will of the God of Heaven, let it be done. Take heed lest any man lay hand upon the House of the God of Heaven, lest there be wrath upon the kingdom of the king and his sons.
²⁴ Moreover, it is declared unto you concerning all the priests, and the Levites, the singers, the doorkeepers, the Nethinim, and the ministers of the House of God, this: that taxes shall not be for thee, neither shalt thou have authority to enslave them.
²⁵ And thou, Ezra, according to the wisdom of thy God that is in thy hand, appoint scribes and judges, that they may judge all the people that are beyond the River, even all such as know the Law of thy God; and to him who knoweth not, do ye make it known.
²⁶ And whosoever shall not be doing the Law of God and the law of the king diligently, let the judgment be executed upon him, whether it be unto death, or unto punishment, or unto the confiscation of his livelihood, or unto bonds.
