ὑμᾶς ἐν μάστιξι, κἀγὼ παιδεύσω ὑμᾶς ἐν σκορπίοις. Καὶ οὐκ ἠ- 15
κουσεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τοῦ λαοῦ, ὅτι ἦν μεταστροφὴ παρὰ Κυρίου, ὅ- πως στήσῃ τὸ ῥῆμα αὐτοῦ, ὃ ἐλάλησε Κύριος ἐν χειρὶ Ἀχιὰ τοῦ
Σηλωνίτου περὶ Ἱεροβοὰμ υἱοῦ Ναβάτ. Καὶ εἶδον πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ, 16
ὅτι οὐκ ἤκουσεν ὁ βασιλεὺς αὐτῶν· καὶ ἀπεκρίθη ὁ λαὸς τῷ βα- σιλεῖ λόγον, λέγων· τίς ἡμῖν μερὶς ἐν Δαυίδ; καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν
ἡμῖν κληρονομία ἐν υἱῶν Ἰεσσαί· ἀπότρεχε εἰς τὰ σκηνώματά σου,
Ἰσραήλ· νῦν βόσκε τὸν οἶκόν σου, Δαυίδ· καὶ ἀπῆλθεν Ἰσραὴλ
εἰς τὰ σκηνώματα αὐτοῦ. Καὶ υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ τῶν καθημένων ἐν 17
πόλεσιν Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτῶν Ῥοβοάμ. Καὶ ἀπέστει- 18
λεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ῥοβοὰμ τὸν Ἀδωνιρὰμ τὸν ἐπὶ τοῦ φόρου, καὶ
ἐλιθοβόλησαν αὐτὸν πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ ἐν λίθοις, καὶ ἀπέθανε· καὶ ὁ
βασιλεὺς Ῥοβοὰμ ἔφθασεν ἀναβῆναι ἐπὶ τὸ ἅρμα τοῦ φυγείν εἰς
Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ ἠθέτησεν Ἰσραὴλ εἰς τὸν οἶκον Δαυὶδ ἕως τῆς 19
ἡμέρας ταύτης. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἤκουσεν Ἰσραὴλ ὅτι ἀνέκαμψεν 20
Ἱεροβοάμ, καὶ ἀπέστειλαν, καὶ εἰσήγαγον αὐτὸν εἰς τὴν συναγω- γήν, καὶ ἐβασίλευσαν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ· καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὀπίσω τοῦ
οἴκου Δαυὶδ πάρεξ σκήπτρου Ἰούδα καὶ Βενιαμεὶν μόνοι. Καὶ Ῥο- 21
βοὰμ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἐξεκκλησίασε τὴν συναγωγὴν
Ἰούδα, καὶ σκῆπτρον Βενιαμείν, ἑκατὸν ὀγδοήκοντα χιλιάδας νε- ανιῶν ποιούντων πόλεμον, τοῦ πολεμεῖν πρὸς οἶκον Ἰσραήλ, ἐπι- στρέψαι τὴν βασιλείαν Ῥοβοὰμ υἱῷ Σαλωμών. Καὶ ἐγένετο λό- 22
γος Κυρίου πρὸς Σαμαίαν ἄνθρωπον τοῦ Θεοῦ, λέγων· εἶπον τῷ 23
Ῥοβοὰμ υἱῷ Σαλωμὼν βασιλεῖ Ἰούδα, καὶ πρὸς πάντα οἶκον Ἰ- ούδα καὶ Βενιαμείν, καὶ τῷ καταλοίπῳ τοῦ λαοῦ, λέγων· τάδε 24
λέγει Κύριος· Οὐκ ἀναβήσεσθε, οὐδὲ μὴ πολεμήσετε μετὰ τῶν
ἀδελφῶν ὑμῶν, υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ· ἀναστρεφέτω ἕκαστος εἰς τὸν οἶκον
αὐτοῦ, ὅτι παρ᾿ ἐμοῦ γέγονε τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο. Καὶ ἤκουσαν τοῦ
λόγου Κυρίου, καὶ κατέπαυσαν τοῦ πορευθῆναι κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα Κυ- ρίου. Καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν Ἱεροβοὰμ τὴν Σίκιμα τὴν ἐν ὄρει Ἐφραίμ, 25
καὶ κατῴκει ἐν αὐτῇ, καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ἐκεῖθεν, καὶ ᾠκοδόμησε τὴν Φα- νουήλ. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἱεροβοὰμ ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ, ἰδοὺ νῦν ἐπι- 26
στρέψει ἡ βασιλεία εἰς τὸν οἶκον Δαυίδ, ἐὰν ἀναβῇ ὁ λαὸς οὗτος 27
ἀναφέρειν θυσίας ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἐπιστραφή- σεται καρδία λαοῦ πρὸς Κύριον καὶ κύριον αὐτῶν, πρὸς Ῥοβοὰμ
βασιλέα Ἰούδα, καὶ ἀποκτενοῦσί με, καὶ ἀποστραφήσονται πρὸς Ῥο-

**20** And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over Israel; and there was none who followed the house of David, save the tribes of Judah and Benjamin only.

**24** Thus saith the Lord, Ye shall not go up, neither shall ye fight against your brethren, the sons of Israel; let every man return to his own house, for this thing is from Me. And they hearkened unto the word of the Lord, and ceased from going according to the word of the Lord.
**25** And Jeroboam built Shechem in Mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and he went out from thence, and built Penuel.

**27** if this people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of the people turn again unto the Lord and their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah; and they shall slay me, and turn again unto Reho-
