¹⁷ τῷ Ἐλνάθαν συνιέντας. Καὶ ἐξήνεγκα αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ ἄρχοντας ἐν ἀργυρίῳ τοῦ τόπου, καὶ ἔθηκα ἐν στόματι αὐτῶν λόγους λαλῆσαι
   πρὸς τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτῶν τῶν Ἀθανεὶμ ἐν ἀργυρίῳ τοῦ τόπου,
¹⁸ τοῦ ἐνέγκαι ἡμῖν ἄδοντας εἰς οἶκον Θεοῦ ἡμῶν. Καὶ ἦλθοσαν ἡμῖν,
   ὡς χεὶρ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν ἀγαθὴ ἐφ᾿ ἡμᾶς, ἀνὴρ Σαχὼν ἀπὸ υἱῶν Μοολὶ, υἱοῦ Λευὶ, υἱοῦ Ἰσραήλ. καὶ ἀρχὴν ἦλθον οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ
¹⁹ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ δεκαοκτώ, καὶ τὸν Ἀσεβία, καὶ τὸν Ἰσαία ἀπὸ
²⁰ υἱῶν Μεραρὶ, ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτῶν εἴκοσι. Καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν
   Ναθινεὶμ ὧν ἔδωκε Δαυὶδ καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες εἰς δουλείαν τῶν Λευιτῶν, Ναθινεὶμ διακόσιοι εἴκοσι, πάντες συνήχθησαν ἐν ὀνόμασι.
²¹ Καὶ ἐκάλεσα ἐκεῖ νηστείαν ἐπὶ τὸν ποταμὸν Ἀουὲ, τοῦ ταπεινωθῆναι ἐνώπιον Θεοῦ ἡμῶν, ζητῆσαι παρ᾿ αὐτοῦ ὁδὸν εὐθεῖαν ἡμῖν
²² καὶ τοῖς τέκνοις ἡμῶν καὶ πάσῃ τῇ κτήσει ἡμῶν. Ὅτι ἠσχύνθην
   αἰτήσασθαι παρὰ τοῦ βασιλέως δύναμιν καὶ ἱππεῖς σῶσαι ἡμᾶς
   ἀπὸ ἐχθροῦ ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ, ὅτι εἴπομεν τῷ βασιλεῖ, λέγοντες· χεὶρ τοῦ
   Θεοῦ ἡμῶν ἐπὶ πάντας τοὺς ζητοῦντας αὐτὸν εἰς ἀγαθὸν καὶ κράτος αὐτοῦ, καὶ θυμὸς αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ πάντας ἐγκαταλείποντας αὐτόν.
²³ Καὶ ἐνηστεύσαμεν καὶ ἐζητήσαμεν παρὰ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν περὶ τούτου,
²⁴ καὶ ἐπήκουσεν ἡμῖν. Καὶ διέστειλα ἀπὸ ἀρχόντων τῶν ἱερέων δώδεκα τῷ Σαραΐα, τῷ Ἀσαβία, καὶ μετ᾿ αὐτῶν ἀπὸ ἀδελφῶν αὐτῶν
²⁵ δέκα. Καὶ ἔστησα αὐτοῖς τὸ ἀργύριον καὶ τὸ χρυσίον καὶ τὰ σκεύη
   ἀπ᾿ ἀρχῆς οἴκου Θεοῦ ἡμῶν, ἃ ὕψωσεν ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ οἱ σύμβουλοι αὐτοῦ καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες αὐτοῦ, καὶ πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ οἱ εὑρισκόμενοι.
²⁶ Καὶ ἔστησα ἐπὶ χεῖρας αὐτῶν ἀργυρίου τάλαντα ἑξακόσια πεντήκοντα, καὶ σκεύη ἀργυρᾶ ἑκατὸν, καὶ τάλαντα χρυσίου ἑκατόν.
²⁷ Καὶ χαφουρὴ χρύσεοι εἴκοσι εἰς τὴν ὁδὸν δραχμῶν χίλιοι, καὶ
   σκεύη χαλκοῦ στίλβοντος ἀγαθοῦ διάφορα ἐπιθυμητὰ ἐν χρυσίῳ.
²⁸ Καὶ εἶπα πρὸς αὐτούς· ὑμεῖς ἅγιοι τῷ Κυρίῳ Θεῷ, καὶ τὰ σκεύη
   ἅγια, καὶ τὸ ἀργύριον καὶ τὸ χρυσίον ἑκούσια τῷ Κυρίῳ Θεῷ πα²⁹ τέρων ὑμῶν, ἀγρυπνεῖτε καὶ τηρεῖτε, ἕως στῆτε ἐνώπιον τῶν ἀρχόντων τῶν ἱερέων καὶ τῶν Λευιτῶν καὶ τῶν ἀρχόντων τῶν πατριῶν ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ εἰς σκηνὰς οἴκου Κυρίου.
³⁰ Καὶ ἐδέξαντο οἱ
   ἱερεῖς καὶ οἱ Λευῖται σταθμὸν τοῦ ἀργυρίου καὶ τοῦ χρυσίου καὶ
³¹ τῶν σκευῶν, ἐνεγκεῖν εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ εἰς οἶκον Θεοῦ ἡμῶν. Καὶ
   ἐξήραμεν ἀπὸ τοῦ ποταμοῦ τοῦ Ἀουὲ ἐν δωδεκάτῃ τοῦ μηνὸς τοῦ
   πρώτου τοῦ ἐλθεῖν εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ· καὶ χεὶρ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν ἦν ἐφ᾿

¹⁷ unto Elnathan, men of understanding. And I sent them forth unto leaders in Argyrion of the place, and I put words in their mouth to speak
   unto their brethren, the Nethinim, in Argyrion of the place,
¹⁸ that they should bring us singers for the House of our God. And they came unto us,
   as the good hand of our God was upon us: a man Sachon of the sons of Mooli,
   the son of Levi, the son of Israel. And in the beginning there came his sons and
¹⁹ his brethren, eighteen [men]; and Hashabiah, and Isaiah of
²⁰ the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty [men]. And of the
   Nethinim, whom David and the princes had given for the service of the Levites,
   two hundred and twenty Nethinim, all of them were assembled by name.
²¹ And I proclaimed a fast there, by the river Ahava, that we might humble
   ourselves before our God, to seek of Him a straight way for us,
²² and for our children, and for all our possessions. For I was ashamed
   to ask of the king a force and horsemen to save us
   from the enemy in the way, for we had spoken unto the king, saying: "The hand of
   our God is upon all them that seek Him for good, and His strength,
   and His wrath is upon all them that forsake Him."
²³ So we fasted and sought [guidance] from our God concerning this,
²⁴ and He heard us. And I set apart twelve of the chief priests,
   [even] Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and with them ten of their brethren.
²⁵ And I delivered unto them the silver and the gold and the vessels,
   [being] the first offerings for the House of our God, which the king and his
   counselors and his princes had elevated, and all Israel who were found [there].
²⁶ And I delivered into their hands six hundred and fifty talents
   of silver, and silver vessels of an hundred talents, and an hundred talents of gold.
²⁷ And twenty golden bowls for the journey, [worth] a thousand drachmas,
   and vessels of fine shining bronze, being various, and precious as gold.
²⁸ And I said unto them: "Ye are holy unto the Lord God, and the vessels are
   holy, and the silver and the gold are freewill offerings unto the Lord God of your
²⁹ fathers. Be watchful and keep them, until ye stand before the chief
   priests and the Levites and the chief men of the fathers' houses in
   Jerusalem, unto the chambers of the House of the Lord."
³⁰ And the
   priests and the Levites received by weight the silver and the gold and
³¹ the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the House of our God.
   And we departed from the river Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month
   to go unto Jerusalem; and the hand of our God was upon
