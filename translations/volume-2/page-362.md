ποταμοῦ Σαβαρβουζαναΐ, καὶ οἱ σύνδουλοι αὐτῶν Ἀφαρσαχαῖοι
7 οἱ ἐν τῷ πέραν τοῦ ποταμοῦ μακρὰν ὄντες ἐκεῖθεν. Καὶ νῦν ἀφετε
τὸ ἔργον οἴκου τοῦ Θεοῦ· οἱ ἀφηγούμενοι τῶν Ἰουδαίων καὶ οἱ
πρεσβύτεροι τῶν Ἰουδαίων οἶκον τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐκεῖνον οἰκοδομείτωσαν
8 ἐπὶ τοῦ τόπου αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ γνώμη ἐτέθη, μή ποτέ τι
ποιήσητε μετὰ τῶν πρεσβυτέρων τῶν Ἰουδαίων τοῦ οἰκοδομῆσαι
οἶκον τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐκεῖνον. καὶ ἀπὸ ὑπαρχόντων βασιλέως τῶν φόρων
πέραν τοῦ ποταμοῦ ἐπιμελῶς δαπάνη ἔστω δεδομένη τοῖς ἀνδρά-
9 σιν ἐκείνοις τὸ μὴ καταργηθῆναι, καὶ ἃ ἂν ὑστέρημα, καὶ υἱοὺς
βοῶν καὶ κριοὺς καὶ ἀμνοὺς εἰς ὁλοκαυτώσεις τῷ Θεῷ τοῦ οὐρα-
νοῦ, πυροὺς, ἅλας, οἶνον, ἔλαιον, κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα τῶν ἱερέων τῶν
ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἔστω διδόμενον αὐτοῖς, ἡμέραν ἐν ἡμέρᾳ δ᾽ ἐὰν αἰ-
10 τήσωσιν, ἵνα ὦσι προσφέροντες εὐωδίας τῷ Θεῷ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ
11 προσεύχωνται εἰς ζωὴν τοῦ βασιλέως καὶ τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ
ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ ἐτέθη γνώμη, ὅτι πᾶς ἄνθρωπος ὃς ἀλλάξει τὸ ῥῆμα
τοῦτο, καθαιρεθήσεται ξύλον ἐκ τῆς οἰκίας αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὠρθωμένος
παγήσεται ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὁ οἶκος αὐτοῦ τὸ κατ᾿ ἐμὲ ποιηθήσε-
12 ται. Καὶ ὁ Θεὸς οὗ κατασκηνώνει τὸ ὄνομα ἐκεῖ, καταστρέψαι πάν-
τα βασιλέα καὶ λαὸν ὃς ἐκτενεῖ τὴν χεῖρα ἑαυτοῦ ἀλλάξαι ἢ ἀφα-
νίσαι τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐκεῖνον τὸν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ. ἐγὼ Δαρεῖος
13 ἔθηκα γνώμην, ἐπιμελῶς ἔσται. Τότε Θαθθαναΐ ἔπαρχος πέραν
τοῦ ποταμοῦ, Σαβαρβουζαναΐ, καὶ οἱ σύνδουλοι αὐτοῦ, πρὸς δ᾽ ἀπέστειλε Δαρεῖος ὁ βασιλεὺς, οὕτως ἐποίησαν ἐπιμελῶς.
14 Καὶ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι τῶν Ἰουδαίων ᾠκοδόμησαν καὶ οἱ Λευῖται ἐν προφητείᾳ Ἀγγαίου τοῦ προφήτου, καὶ Ζαχαρίου υἱοῦ Ἀδδώ. Καὶ ἀνῳκοδόμησαν καὶ κατηρτίσαντο ἀπὸ γνώμης Θεοῦ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἀπὸ γνώμης Κύρου καὶ Δαρείου καὶ Ἀρθασασθὰ βασιλέως Περσῶν.
15 Καὶ ἐτέλεσαν τὸν οἶκον τοῦτον ἕως ἡμέρας τρίτης μηνὸς Ἀδάρ,
16 ὅ ἐστιν ἔτος ἕκτον τῆς βασιλείας Δαρείου τοῦ βασιλέως. Καὶ
ἐποίησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ, οἱ ἱερεῖς καὶ οἱ Λευῖται, καὶ οἱ κατάλοι-
ποι υἱῶν ἀποικεσίας ἐγκαίνια τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐν εὐφροσύνῃ.
17 Καὶ προσήνεγκαν εἰς τὰ ἐγκαίνια τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ Θεοῦ μόσχους ἑκα-
τόν, κριοὺς διακοσίους, ἀμνοὺς τετρακοσίους, χειμάῤῥους αἰγῶν
περὶ ἁμαρτίας ὑπὲρ παντὸς Ἰσραὴλ δώδεκα εἰς ἀριθμὸν φυλῶν
18 Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἔστησαν τοὺς ἱερεῖς ἐν διαιρέσεσιν αὐτῶν, καὶ τοὺς
Λευίτας ἐν μερισμοῖς αὐτῶν, ἐπὶ δουλείᾳ Θεοῦ τοῦ ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ,

of the River, Shethar-boznai, and your fellow servants the Apharsachites
⁷ who are beyond the River, keep yourselves far from thence. And now, cease ye from the work of the house of God; let the leaders of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build that house of God upon its appointed place.
⁸ And from me a decree was made, that ye shall in no wise meddle with the elders of the Jews concerning the building of that house of God. Moreover, from the king's resources, even from the taxes beyond the River, let expenses be diligently supplied to those men, that they be not hindered.
⁹ And whatsoever is lacking, even young bulls and rams and lambs for burnt offerings unto the God of Heaven, and wheat, salt, wine, and oil, let it be given unto them day by day, according to the word of the priests who are in Jerusalem, if they should ask it,
¹⁰ that they may offer sweet savours unto the God of Heaven, and pray for the life of the king and of his sons.
¹¹ And from me a decree was issued, that whosoever shall alter this word, a beam shall be pulled down from his house, and he, being set upright, shall be impaled thereupon; and his house shall be made according to my decree.
¹² And may the God, Whose Name dwelleth there, overthrow every king and people who shall stretch forth his hand to alter or to destroy that house of God which is in Jerusalem. I, Darius, have made this decree; let it be diligently performed.
¹³ Then Tatnai, the governor beyond the River, Shethar-boznai, and their fellow servants, unto whom Darius the king had sent, so did they diligently.
¹⁴ And the elders of the Jews built, and the Levites, according to the prophecy of Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they rebuilt and completed it by the decree of the God of Israel, and by the decree of Cyrus and Darius and Artaxerxes, the king of Persia.
¹⁵ And they finished this house on the third day of the month Adar, which was the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.
¹⁶ And the children of Israel, the priests and the Levites, and the remnant of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of the house of God with joy.
¹⁷ And they offered at the dedication of the house of God one hundred calves, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin offering for all Israel, twelve he-goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.
¹⁸ And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God Who is in Jerusalem,
