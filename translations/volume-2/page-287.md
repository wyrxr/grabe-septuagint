ΚΑΙ εἶπε Δαυὶδ ὁ βασιλεὺς πάσῃ τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ· Σαλωμὼν ὁ 1
υἱός μου εἰς ὃν ᾑρέτικεν ἐν αὐτῷ Κύριος, νέος καὶ ἁπαλὸς, καὶ τὸ
ἔργον μέγα, ὅτι οὐκ ἀνθρώπῳ ἡ οἰκοδομὴ, ἀλλ’ ἢ Κυρίῳ Θεῷ.
Κατὰ πᾶσαν τὴν δύναμιν ἡτοίμακα εἰς οἶκον Θεοῦ μου χρυσίον, 2
ἀργύριον, χαλκὸν, σίδηρον, ξύλα, λίθους Σοὸμ, καὶ πληρώσεως,
(καὶ) λίθους πολυτελεῖς καὶ ποικίλους, καὶ πάντα λίθον τίμιον καὶ 3
Πάριον πολύν. Καὶ ἔτι ἐν τῷ εὐδοκῆσαί με ἐν οἴκῳ Θεοῦ μου,
ἔστι μοι ἃ περιπεποίημαι χρυσίον καὶ ἀργύριον, καὶ ἰδοὺ δέδωκα
εἰς οἶκον Θεοῦ μου εἰς ὕψος, ἐκτὸς ὧν ἡτοίμακα εἰς οἶκον τῶν
ἁγίων, τρισχίλια τάλαντα χρυσίου τοῦ ἐκ Σουφεὶρ, καὶ ἑπτακισχί- 4
λια τάλαντα ἀργυρίου δοκίμου ἐξαλειφθῆναι ἐν αὐτοῖς τοὺς τοί-
χους τοῦ ἱεροῦ, εἰς τὸ χρυσίον τῷ χρυσίῳ, καὶ εἰς τὸ ἀργύριον τῷ 5
ἀργυρίῳ, καὶ εἰς πᾶν ἔργον διὰ χειρὸς τεχνιτῶν. καὶ τίς ὁ προθυ-
μούμενος πληρῶσαι τὰς χεῖρας αὑτοῦ σήμερον Κυρίῳ; Καὶ προ- 6
εθυμήθησαν ἄρχοντες τῶν πατριῶν, καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσ-
ραὴλ, καὶ οἱ χιλίαρχοι, καὶ οἱ ἑκατόνταρχοι, καὶ οἱ προστάται τῶν
ἔργων, καὶ οἱ οἰκονόμοι τοῦ βασιλέως. Καὶ ἔδωκαν εἰς τὰ ἔργα 7
τοῦ οἴκου Κυρίου χρυσίου τάλαντα πεντακισχίλια, καὶ χρυσοῦς
μυρίους· καὶ ἀργυρίου ταλάντων δέκα χιλιάδας, καὶ χαλκοῦ τά-
λαντα μύρια ὀκτακισχίλια, καὶ σιδήρου ταλάντων χιλιάδας ἑκα-
τόν. Καὶ οἷς εὑρέθη παρ’ αὐτοῖς λίθος, ἔδωκαν εἰς τὰς ἀποθήκας 8
οἴκου Κυρίου διὰ χειρὸς Ἰειὴλ τοῦ Γηρσωνί. Καὶ ηὐφράνθη ὁ λαὸς
ὑπὲρ τοῦ προθυμηθῆναι, ὅτι ἐν καρδίᾳ πλήρει προεθυμήθησαν τῷ 9
Κυρίῳ. καὶ Δαυὶδ ὁ βασιλεὺς ηὐφράνθη μεγάλως· καὶ εὐλόγησεν ὁ
βασιλεὺς Δαυὶδ τὸν Κύριον ἐνώπιον τῆς ἐκκλησίας, λέγων· εὐλο- 10
γητὸς εἶ, Κύριε ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραὴλ, ὁ πατὴρ ἡμῶν, ἀπὸ τοῦ αἰῶνος,
καὶ ἕως τοῦ αἰῶνος· σοί, Κύριε, ἡ μεγαλωσύνη, καὶ ἡ δύναμις, καὶ 11
τὸ καύχημα, καὶ ἡ νίκη, καὶ ἡ ἰσχὺς, ὅτι σὺ πάντων τῶν ἐν τῷ

<br>
`20` ...the inner doors, and the house of atonement,
    and the pattern of the House of the Lord.
`21` And behold, the courses of the priests,
    and of the Levites, for all the service of the House of God;
    and with thee in every undertaking,
    and every one who is willing in wisdom,
    according to every craft,
    and the rulers, and all the people,

CHAPTER 29.
<br>
`1` And David the king said unto all the congregation:
    "Solomon my son, whom the Lord hath chosen in him,
    is young and tender; and the work is great.
    For the building is not for man, but for the Lord God.
`2` Now, according to all my power,
    have I prepared for the house of my God:
    gold, silver, bronze, iron, wood,
    stones of Shoham, and for inlaying,
    (and) precious stones and diverse,
    and every costly stone,
    and much Parian marble.
`3` Moreover, because I have taken pleasure
    in the house of my God,
    I have that which I have acquired, gold and silver.
    And behold, I have given it unto the house of my God
    for the magnificence thereof,
    beyond that which I have prepared for the house of the holy things:
`4` three thousand talents of gold from Souphir,
    and seven thousand talents of refined silver,
    to overlay therewith the walls of the Temple,
`5` for the gold, for the gold;
    and for the silver, for the silver;
    and for all the work by the hand of craftsmen.
    And who is he that is willing to consecrate his hands
    unto the Lord this day?"
`6` Then the chiefs of the tribes,
    and the leaders of the sons of Israel,
    and the chiliarchs, and the hecatontarchs,
    and the superintendents of the works,
    and the stewards of the king, offered willingly.
`7` And they gave for the works of the House of the Lord:
    of gold, five thousand talents and ten thousand golden [units];
    and of silver, ten thousand talents;
    and of bronze, eighteen thousand talents;
    and of iron, one hundred thousand talents.
`8` And whosoever had stones among them,
    they gave them into the treasuries of the House of the Lord,
    by the hand of Jeiel the Gershonite.
`9` And the people rejoiced because they had offered willingly,
    for with a perfect heart they offered willingly unto the Lord.
    And David the king rejoiced with great joy;
`10` and King David blessed the Lord before all the congregation, saying:
    "Blessed art Thou, O Lord, the God of Israel, our Father,
    from everlasting to everlasting.
`11` Thine, O Lord, is the greatness, and the power,
