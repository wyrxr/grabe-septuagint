ΚΕΦ. ΚΓʹ. ΤΩΝ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ ΙΟΥΔΑ Βʹ.
Καὶ κυκλώσουσιν οἱ Λευῖται τὸν βασιλέα κύκλῳ, ἀνδρὸς σκεῦος ἐν 7
χειρὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὁ εἰσπορευόμενος εἰς τὸν οἶκον ἀποθανεῖται, καὶ ἔσον-
ται μετὰ τοῦ βασιλέως, εἰσπορευομένου καὶ ἐκπορευομένου αὐτοῦ.
Καὶ ἐποίησαν οἱ Λευῖται καὶ πᾶς Ἰούδα κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἐνετείλατο 8
Ἰωδαὲ ὁ ἱερεύς· καὶ ἔλαβον ἕκαστος τοὺς ἄνδρας ἑαυτοῦ ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς
τοῦ σαββάτου ἕως ἐξόδου τοῦ σαββάτου, ὅτι οὐ κατέλυσεν Ἰωδαὲ ὁ ἱε-
ρεὺς τὰς ἐφημερίας. Καὶ ἔδωκεν Ἰωδαὲ τὰς μαχαίρας, καὶ τοὺς θυ- 9
ρεοὺς, καὶ τὰ ὅπλα ἃ ἦν τοῦ βασιλέως Δαυὶδ ἐν οἴκῳ τοῦ Θεοῦ· καὶ 10
ἔζησε πάντα τὸν λαὸν, ἕκαστον ἐν τοῖς ὅπλοις ἑαυτοῦ, ἀπὸ τῆς ὠμίας
τοῦ οἴκου τῆς δεξιᾶς ἕως τῆς ὠμίας τῆς ἀριστερᾶς τοῦ θυσιαστη-
ρίου, καὶ τοῦ οἴκου ἐπὶ τὸν βασιλέα κύκλῳ. Καὶ ἐξήγαγε τὸν 11
υἱὸν τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ ἔδωκεν ἐπ’ αὐτὸν τὸ βασίλειον, καὶ τὰ μαρ-
τύρια, καὶ ἐβασίλευσαν καὶ ἔχρισαν αὐτὸν Ἰωδαὲ, καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐ-
τοῦ, καὶ εἶπαν· Ζήτω ὁ βασιλεύς. Καὶ ἤκουσε Γοθολία τὴν φω- 12
νὴν τοῦ λαοῦ τῶν τρεχόντων, καὶ ἐξομολογουμένων, καὶ αἰνούν-
των τὸν βασιλέα· καὶ εἰσῆλθε πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα εἰς οἶκον Κυρίου.
Καὶ ἴδε, καὶ ἰδοὺ ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐπὶ τῆς στάσεως αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς 13
εἰσόδου οἱ ἄρχοντες, καὶ αἱ σάλπιγγες, ἄρχοντες περὶ τὸν βασιλέα.
καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς τῆς γῆς ηὐφράνθη, καὶ ἐσάλπισαν ἐν σάλπιγξι,
καὶ οἱ ᾄδοντες ἐν τοῖς ὀργάνοις ᾠδοὶ, καὶ ὑμνοῦντες αἶνον. Καὶ
διέρρηξε Γοθολία τὴν στολὴν ἑαυτῆς, καὶ ἐβόησε, καὶ εἶπεν· ἐπι-
θέμενοι ἐπιτίθεσθε. Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Ἰωδαὲ ὁ ἱερεὺς, καὶ ἐνετείλατο 14
Ἰωδαὲ ὁ ἱερεὺς τοῖς ἑκατοντάρχοις, καὶ τοῖς ἀρχηγοῖς τῆς δυνά-
μεως, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· ἐκβάλετε αὐτὴν ἐκτὸς τοῦ οἴκου, καὶ ἐξέλ-
θετε ὀπίσω αὐτῆς, καὶ ἀποθανέτω μαχαίρᾳ, ὅτι εἶπεν ὁ ἱερεὺς,
μὴ ἀποθανέτω ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου. Καὶ ἔδωκαν αὐτῇ ἄνεσιν, καὶ διῆλ- 15
θε διὰ τῆς πύλης τῶν ἵππων τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ ἐθα-
νάτωσαν αὐτὴν ἐκεῖ. Καὶ διέθετο Ἰωδαὲ διαθήκην ἀναμέσον αὐ- 16
τοῦ καὶ τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ τοῦ βασιλέως, εἶναι λαὸν τῷ Κυρίῳ. Καὶ 17
εἰσῆλθε πᾶς ὁ λαὸς τῆς γῆς εἰς οἶκον Βάαλ, καὶ κατέσπασαν αὐ-
τὸν καὶ τὰ θυσιαστήρια αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰ εἴδωλα αὐτοῦ ἐλέπτυναν,
καὶ τὸν Ματθὰν τὸν ἱερέα τῆς Βάαλ ἐθανάτωσαν ἐναντίον τῶν
θυσιαστηρίων αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐνεχείρισεν Ἰωδαὲ ὁ ἱερεὺς τὰ ἔργα 18
οἴκου Κυρίου διὰ χειρὸς ἱερέων, καὶ τῶν Λευιτῶν, καὶ ἀνέστησε
τὰς ἐφημερίας τῶν ἱερέων, καὶ τῶν Λευιτῶν, ἃς διέστειλε Δαυὶδ
ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου, καὶ ἀνενέγκαι ὁλοκαυτώματα τῷ Κυρίῳ,

**CHAPTER XXIII. OF THE KINGDOMS OF JUDAH. II.**

⁷ And the Levites shall encircle the king round about, every man with his weapon in his hand; and whosoever entereth into the house shall be put to death. And they shall be with the king, when he cometh in and when he goeth out.

⁸ And the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded. And each man took his men, from the beginning of the Sabbath even until the end of the Sabbath; for Jehoiada the priest had not dismissed the [priestly] courses.

⁹ And Jehoiada gave the swords, and the shields, and the weapons which had belonged to King David, [and which were] in the house of God.

¹⁰ And he preserved all the people, each man with his weapons, from the right flank of the House, even unto the left flank of the altar and of the House, surrounding the king in a circle.

¹¹ And he brought forth the king's son, and placed upon him the royal crown and the testimony [of the Law]; and they caused him to reign, and Jehoiada and his sons anointed him. And they cried, "Long live the King!"

¹² And Gotholia heard the voice of the people as they ran, and acclaimed, and praised the king. And she came unto the king, into the house of the Lord.

¹³ And she looked, and behold, the king stood on his platform, and at the entrance were the chiefs and the trumpeters, chiefs around the king. And all the people of the land rejoiced, and they sounded forth with trumpets, and those who sang with instruments [sang] songs, and hymned praises. And Gotholia tore her garment, and cried aloud, saying, "Conspiracy! Conspiracy!"

¹⁴ And Jehoiada the priest went forth, and Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of hundreds and the chiefs of the army, and said unto them, "Lead her forth outside the house; and follow after her, and let her be slain by the sword." For the priest had said, "Let her not be put to death in the house of the Lord."

¹⁵ And they made way for her, and she passed through the horse gate of the king's house, and they slew her there.

¹⁶ And Jehoiada made a covenant between himself, and the people, and the king, that they should be a people for the Lord.

¹⁷ And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and they tore it down, and its altars, and its idols they crushed to powder. And Mattan, the priest of Baal, they slew before his altars.

¹⁸ And Jehoiada the priest committed the works of the house of the Lord into the hand of the priests and the Levites; and he restored the courses of the priests and of the Levites, which David had appointed for the house of the Lord, [that they should] offer up burnt offerings to the Lord,
