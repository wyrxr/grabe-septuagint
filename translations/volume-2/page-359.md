⁹ [Thus did] Rehum Baal-tam and Shimshai the scribe, and our other fellow servants, the Dinaites, the Apharsachites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, and the other nations,
¹⁰ whom Asenappar, that great and honorable one, had deported, and settled them in the cities of Samaria, and the rest beyond the river.
¹¹ This is the copy of the letter which they sent unto him, [saying]: "To King Artaxerxes, thy servants, the men beyond the river, send greetings.
¹² Be it known unto the king, that the Jews who came up from thee to us are come unto Jerusalem, that rebellious and wicked city, which they do build; and the walls thereof are prepared, and its foundations they have raised.
¹³ Now therefore, be it known unto the king, that if that city be built again, and its walls be completed, then will no tribute be unto thee, nor will they give [unto thy coffers]; and this thing doth bring harm upon kings.
¹⁴ And it is not meet for us to suffer the king's dishonor; for this cause have we sent and made known unto the king,
¹⁵ that he may search in the book of the records of thy fathers, and thou shalt find and know that that city is a rebellious city, and harmful to kings and to provinces, and flights of bondservants do occur in the midst thereof from ancient times; for these causes was this city laid waste.
¹⁶ We make known therefore unto the king, that if that city be built, and its walls be completed, thou shalt have no peace."

¹⁷ Then sent the king [a letter] unto Rehum Baal-tam, and Shimshai the scribe, and unto their other fellow servants who dwell in Samaria, and unto the rest who dwell beyond the river, sending greetings. And he saith:
¹⁸ "The tax-collector, whom ye sent unto us, was called before me; and by my [command] a decree was set forth, and we have searched,
¹⁹ and have found that that city from ancient days hath lifted itself up against kings, and rebellions and flights of bondservants do occur in it.
²⁰ And mighty kings have been over Jerusalem, and have held sway over all the [land] beyond the river, and full tributes and portions were given unto them.
²¹ Now therefore, set forth a decree to make those men cease, and that city shall not be built again.
²² Wherefore, that ye be diligent to cause no delay concerning this, lest perhaps destruction increase to the detriment of kings."
²³ Then indeed the tax-collector of Artaxerxes the king read [the letter] before Rehum and Shimshai the scribe and his fellow servants; and they went in haste.
