Μιχαήλ, καὶ Σαφατίας: πάντες οὗτοι υἱοὶ Ἰωσαφὰτ βασιλέως Ἰού-
3 δα. Καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς ὁ πατὴρ αὐτῶν δόματα πολλά, ἀργύριον
καὶ χρυσίον, καὶ ὅπλα μετὰ πόλεων τειτειχισμένων ἐν Ἰούδα, καὶ
4 τὴν βασιλείαν ἔδωκε τῷ Ἰωράμ, ὅτι οὗτος ὁ πρωτότοκος. Καὶ
ἀνέστη Ἰωρὰμ ἐπὶ τὴν βασιλείαν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐκραταιώθη, καὶ ἀπ-
5 ἔκτεινε πάντας τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ἀρ-
χόντων Ἰσραήλ· ὢν αὐτὸς τριάκοντα καὶ δύο ἐτῶν, κατέστη Ἰω-
6 ράμ ἐπὶ τὴν βασιλείαν ἑαυτοῦ, καὶ ὀκτὼ ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ἱε-
ρουσαλήμ. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἐν ὁδῷ βασιλέων Ἰσραήλ, ὡς ἐποίησεν οἶ-
7 κος Ἀχαάβ, ὅτι θυγάτηρ Ἀχαὰβ ἦν αὐτοῦ ἡ γυνή, καὶ ἐποίησε
τὸ πονηρὸν ἐναντίον Κυρίου. Καὶ οὐκ ἐβούλετο Κύριος ἐξολε-
8 θρεῦσαι τὸν οἶκον Δαυίδ, διὰ τὴν διαθήκην ἣν διεθέτο τῷ Δαυίδ,
καὶ ὡς εἶπεν αὐτῷ, δοῦναι αὐτῷ λύχνον καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ πά-
9 σας τὰς ἡμέρας. Ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις ἀπέστη Ἐδὼμ ἀπὸ τοῦ
Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐβασίλευσαν ἐφ’ ἑαυτοὺς βασιλέα. Καὶ ᾤχετο Ἰωρὰμ
10 μετὰ τῶν ἀρχόντων, καὶ πᾶσα ἡ ἵππος μετ’ αὐτοῦ. καὶ ἐγένετο,
καὶ ἠγέρθη νυκτός, καὶ ἐπάταξεν Ἐδὼμ τὸν κυκλοῦντα αὐτόν, καὶ
τοὺς ἄρχοντας τῶν ἁρμάτων, καὶ ἔφυγεν ὁ λαὸς εἰς τὰ σκηνώμα-
τα αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἀπέστη Ἐδὼμ ἀπὸ χειρὸς Ἰούδα ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας
ταύτης· τότε ἀπέστη Λοβνὰ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ ἀπὸ χειρὸς αὐ-
11 τοῦ, ὅτι ἐγκατέλιπε τὸν Κύριον Θεὸν τῶν πατέρων ἑαυτοῦ. Καὶ
γὰρ αὐτὸς ἐποίησεν ὑψηλὰ ἐν πόλεσιν Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐξεπόρνευσε τοὺς
12 κατοικοῦντας Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἀπεπλάνησε τὸν Ἰούδαν. Καὶ ἦλ-
θεν αὐτῷ ἐν γραφῇ παρὰ Ἠλιού τοῦ προφήτου, λέγων· τάδε λέγει
Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Δαυὶδ τοῦ πατρός σου· ἀνθ’ ὧν οὐκ ἐπορεύθης ἐν
ὁδῷ Ἰωσαφὰτ τοῦ πατρός σου, καὶ ἐν ὁδοῖς Ἀσὰ βασιλέως Ἰού-
13 δα· καὶ ἐπορεύθης ἐν ὁδοῖς βασιλέων Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐξεπόρνευσας
τὸν Ἰούδαν, καὶ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας Ἱερουσαλήμ, ὡς ἐξεπόρνευσεν
ὁ οἶκος Ἀχαάβ, καὶ τοὺς ἀδελφούς σου, υἱοὺς τοῦ πατρός σου,
14 τοὺς ἀγαθοὺς ὑπὲρ σὲ ἀπέκτεινας· ἰδοὺ Κύριος πατάξει σε πληγὴν
μεγάλην ἐν τῷ λαῷ σου, καὶ ἐν τοῖς υἱοῖς σου, καὶ ἐν γυναιξί σου,
15 καὶ ἐν πάσῃ τῇ ἀποσκευῇ σου. Καὶ σὺ ἐν μαλακίᾳ πονηρᾷ, ἐν νό-
σῳ κοιλίας, ἕως οὗ ἐξέλθῃ ἡ κοιλία σου μετὰ τῆς μαλακίας ἐξ
16 ἡμερῶν εἰς ἡμέρας. Καὶ ἐπήγειρε Κύριος ἐπὶ Ἰωρὰμ τοὺς ἀλλο-
17 φύλους, καὶ τοὺς Ἄραβας, καὶ τοὺς ὁμόρους τῶν Αἰθιόπων· καὶ
ἀνέβησαν ἐπὶ Ἰούδαν, καὶ κατεδυνάστευσαν, καὶ ἀπέστρεψαν πᾶσαν

### CHAPTER XXI

² ...Michael, and Shephatiah: all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah.

³ And their father gave them many gifts, of silver and of gold, and weapons, along with cities exceeding fortified in Judah;

⁴ yet the kingdom gave he unto Jehoram, because he was the firstborn. And when Jehoram was established upon his kingdom, and was made strong,

⁵ he slew all his brethren with the sword, and certain of the princes of Israel. Being himself thirty and two years old, Jehoram was established over his kingdom, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.

⁶ And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab; for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord.

⁷ Howbeit the Lord would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant which He had made with David, and according as He had spoken unto him to give him a lamp, and to his sons, for all days.

⁸ In those days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and they made a king over themselves. And Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots with him.

⁹ And it came to pass that he rose up by night, and smote Edom, who had encompassed him, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled into their tents.

¹⁰ So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. Then did Lobna revolt from under his hand at that same time, because he had forsaken the Lord God of his fathers.

¹¹ Moreover he himself made high places in the cities of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit harlotry, and led Judah astray.

¹² And there came to him a writing from Elijah the prophet, saying, "Thus saith the Lord God of David thy father: Because thou hast not walked in the way of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah;

¹³ but hast walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and hast caused Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit harlotry, as did the house of Ahab; and also thy brethren, the sons of thy father, who were better than thou, hast thou slain:

¹⁴ Behold, the Lord shall smite thee with a great plague among thy people, and among thy sons, and among thy wives, and among all thy goods;

¹⁵ And thou thyself [shalt be smitten] with a grievous sickness, even with a disease of the bowels, until thy bowels come forth with the sickness day by day."

¹⁶ And the Lord stirred up against Jehoram the Philistines, and the Arabians, and those that dwelt near the Ethiopians;

¹⁷ And they came up against Judah, and ravaged them, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king’s house, and his sons, and his daughters; so that there was not left to him a son, save only Ahaziah, the youngest of his sons.
