ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Α΄. ΚΕΦ. ΚΔ΄.
7 αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπε Δαυὶδ πρὸς τοὺς ἄνδρας αὐτοῦ· μηδαμῶς μοι
παρὰ Κυρίου, εἰ ποιήσω τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο τῷ κυρίῳ μου τῷ χρι-
στῷ Κυρίου, ἐπενεγκεῖν χεῖρά μου ἐπ᾿ αὐτόν, ὅτι χριστὸς Κυ-
8 ρίου ἐστὶν οὗτος. Καὶ ἔπεισε Δαυὶδ τοὺς ἄνδρας αὐτοῦ ἐν λόγοις
καὶ οὐκ ἔδωκεν αὐτοὺς ἀναστάντας θανατῶσαι τὸν Σαούλ. Καὶ
9 ἀνέστη ἐκ τοῦ σπηλαίου, καὶ κατέβη εἰς τὴν ὁδόν. Καὶ ἀνέστη
Δαυὶδ ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ἐκ τοῦ σπηλαίου· καὶ ἐβόησε
Δαυὶδ ὀπίσω Σαοὺλ, λέγων· Κύριέ μου βασιλεῦ. Καὶ ἐπέβλεψε
Σαοὺλ ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔκυψε Δαυὶδ ἐπὶ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ
10 τὴν γῆν, καὶ προσεκύνησεν αὐτῷ. Καὶ εἶπε Δαυὶδ πρὸς Σαούλ·
ἱνατὶ ἀκούεις τῶν λόγων τοῦ λαοῦ λεγόντων, ἰδοὺ Δαυὶδ ζητεῖ
11 τὴν ψυχήν σου; ἰδοὺ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρα ταύτη ἑωράκασιν οἱ ὀφθαλμοί
σου ὡς παρέδωκέ σε σήμερον Κύριος εἰς χεῖράς μου ἐν τῷ σπη-
λαίῳ, καὶ οὐκ ἐβουλήθην ἀποκτεῖναί σε, καὶ ἐφεισάμην σου, καὶ εἶ-
πα· οὐκ ἐποίησω χεῖρά μου ἐπὶ κύριόν μου, ὅτι χριστὸς Κυρίου
12 ἐστί. Καὶ πάτερ μου, καὶ ἰδοὺ τὸ πτερύγιον τῆς διπλοΐδος σου
ἐν τῇ χειρί μου, ἐγὼ ἀφήρηκα τὸ πτερύγιον τοῦ ἱματίου σου, καὶ
οὐκ ἀπέκταγκά σε· καὶ γνῶθι καὶ ἴδε σήμερον, ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν
τῇ χειρί μου κακία, οὐδὲ ἀθέτησις, οὐδὲ ἀσέβεια, καὶ οὐχ ἡμάρ-
τηκα εἰς σέ, καὶ σὺ δεσμεύεις τὴν ψυχήν μου λαβεῖν αὐτήν· δι-
13 κάσαι Κύριος ἀναμέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ σοῦ, καὶ ἐκδικήσαι με Κύριος
ἐκ σοῦ· καὶ ἡ χείρ μου οὐκ ἔσται ἐπὶ σοί, καθὼς λέγεται ἡ πα-
ραβολὴ ἡ ἀρχαία· Ἐξ ἀνόμων ἐξελεύσεται πλημμέλεια· καὶ ἡ
14 χείρ μου οὐκ ἔσται ἐπὶ σέ. Καὶ νῦν ὀπίσω τίνος σὺ ἐκπορεύῃ
15 βασιλεῦ Ἰσραήλ; ὀπίσω τίνος καταδιώκεις σύ; ὀπίσω κυνὸς τε-
θνηκότος, καὶ ὀπίσω φύλλου ἑνός; Γένοιτο Κύριος εἰς κριτὴν καὶ
16 δικαστὴν ἀναμέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ ἀναμέσον σου, ἴδοι Κύριος καὶ κρί-
ναι τὴν κρίσιν μου, καὶ δικάσαι μοι ἐκ χειρός σου. Καὶ ἐγένετο
17 ὡς συνετέλεσε Δαυὶδ λαλῶν τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα πρὸς Σαούλ, καὶ εἶ-
πε Σαοὺλ· ἡ φωνή σου αὕτη, τέκνον Δαυίδ; καὶ ἦρε Σαοὺλ τὴν
18 φωνὴν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔκλαυσε. Καὶ εἶπε Σαοὺλ πρὸς Δαυίδ· δίκαι-
ος σὺ ὑπὲρ ἐμέ, ὅτι σὺ ἀνταπεδώκάς μοι ἀγαθά, ἐγὼ δὲ ἀντα-
19 πεδωκά σοι κακά. Καὶ σὺ ἀπήγγειλάς μοι σήμερον ἃ ἐποίησας
μοι ἀγαθά, ὡς ἀπέκλεισέ με Κύριος σήμερον εἰς χεῖράς σου, καὶ
20 οὐκ ἀπέκτεινάς με. Καὶ ὅτι εὑρών τις τὸν ἐχθρὸν αὐτοῦ ἐν θλί-
ψει, καὶ ἐκπέμψει αὐτὸν ἐν ὁδῷ ἀγαθῇ, καὶ Κύριος ἀνταποδώσει

**7** And David said unto his men, "The Lord forbid that I should do this thing unto my lord, the Anointed of the Lord, to lay mine hand upon him; for he is the Anointed of the Lord."
**8** And David persuaded his men with [his] words, and suffered them not to rise up and slay Saul.
**9** And Saul rose up out of the cave, and went his way. And David arose after him, and went forth out of the cave, and David cried after Saul, saying, "My lord, O king!" And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself.
**10** And David said unto Saul, "Wherefore hearkenest thou unto the words of men, saying, 'Behold, David seeketh thy life'?
**11** Behold, thine eyes have seen this day how that the Lord did deliver thee today into mine hand in the cave; and I would not kill thee, but spared thee, and said, 'I would not bring forth mine hand upon my lord, for he is the Anointed of the Lord.'
**12** Moreover, my father, behold, the skirt of thy robe is in my hand; for I did cut off the skirt of thy garment, and killed thee not. Know thou and see this day, that there is no wickedness in my hand, nor treachery, nor impiety, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou liest in wait for my life to take it.
**13** The Lord judge betwixt me and thee, and the Lord avenge me of thee; but my hand shall not be upon thee. As saith the ancient proverb, 'From the wicked cometh forth wickedness'; therefore my hand shall not be upon thee.
**14** And now, after whom dost thou go out, O king of Israel?
**15** After whom dost thou pursue? After a dead dog, and after a single leaf?
**16** The Lord be judge and arbiter betwixt me and betwixt thee; may the Lord see and judge my cause, and deliver me from thy hand."
**17** And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, "Is this thy voice, my son David?" And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.
**18** And Saul said unto David, "Thou art more righteous than I; for thou hast rendered unto me good, whereas I have rendered unto thee evil.
**19** And thou hast this day declared unto me how thou hast dealt well with me; forasmuch as the Lord did deliver me today into thine hand, and thou killedst me not.
**20** For if a man find his enemy in distress, and send him away on a good way, then the Lord shall repay."
