#### CHAPTER XV.

**8** ...and between Jeroboam. And Abijah slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David; and Asa his son reigned in his stead.
**9** And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel,
**10** Asa began to reign over Judah, and forty and one years he reigned in Jerusalem.
**11** And the name of his mother was Maachah, the daughter of Absalom. And Asa did that which was right in the sight of the Lord,
**12** as did David his father. And he took away the sacred rites from the land,
**13** and he cast out all the practices which his fathers had wrought. And Maachah his mother he removed, that she should not be a queen mother, inasmuch as she had made an assembly in her grove.
**14** And Asa cut down her abominable images, and burned [them] with fire in the brook Kidron. Nevertheless, the high places he removed not.
**15** For the heart of Asa was perfect with the Lord all his days. And he brought in the pillars of his father,
**16** and his [own] pillars he brought into the house of the Lord: silver, and gold, and vessels. And there was war between Asa and between Baasha king of Israel all their days.
**17** And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that none might go out or come in unto Asa king of Judah.
**18** And Asa took all the silver, and the gold that was found in the treasuries of the house of the Lord, and in the treasuries of the king's house, and gave them into the hands of his servants; and King Asa sent them unto the son of Ader, the son of Taba, in Ramiah, the son of Azin, king of Syria, who dwelt in Damascus,
**19** saying, "Make a covenant between me and thee, and between my father and thy father; behold, I have sent thee a gift, [even] silver and gold. Come, therefore, and break thy covenant which thou hast with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me."
**20** And the son of Ader hearkened unto King Asa, and sent the captains of his forces unto the cities of Israel, and smote Ain, and Dan, and Abel of the house of Maachah,
**21** and all Chinnereth, even all the land of Naphtali. And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he ceased from building Ramah, and returned to Tirzah.
**22** And King Asa commanded all the people of Judah to Anacheim; and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had built...

ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Γʹ.                   ΚΕΦ. ΙΕʹ.

8    καὶ ἀναμέσον Ἱεροβοάμ. Καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Ἀβιοὺ μετὰ τῶν πατέ-
    ρων αὐτοῦ, καὶ θάπτεται ἐν πόλει Δαυΐδ· καὶ βασιλεύει Ἀσὰ
9    υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐν ἔτει εἰκοστῷ τοῦ Ἱεροβοὰμ βα-
10  σιλέως Ἰσραήλ, βασιλεύει Ἀσὰ ἐπὶ Ἰούδαν, καὶ τεσσαράκοντα καὶ
    ἓν ἔτος ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ·
11  καὶ ὄνομα τῆς μητρὸς αὐ-
    τοῦ Μααχά, θυγάτηρ Ἀβεσσαλώμ. Καὶ ἐποίησεν Ἀσὰ τὸ εὐθὲς
12  ἐνώπιον Κυρίου ὡς Δαυΐδ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἀφεῖλε τὰς τελε-
13  τὰς ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἐξαπέστειλε πάντα τὰ ἐπιτηδεύματα ἃ ἐ-
    ποίησαν οἱ πατέρες αὐτοῦ. Καὶ τὴν Μααχὰ τὴν μητέρα αὐτοῦ
    μετέστησε τοῦ μὴ εἶναι ἡγουμένην, καθὼς ἐποίησε σύνοδον ἐν τῷ
14  ἄλσει αὐτῆς· καὶ ἐξέκοψεν Ἀσὰ τὰς καταδύσεις αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐνέ-
    πρησε πυρὶ ἐν τῷ χειμάρρῳ τοῦ Κέδρων. Τὰ δὲ ὑψηλὰ οὐκ ἐ-
15  ξῆρε· πλὴν καρδία Ἀσὰ ἦν τελεία μετὰ Κυρίου πάσας τὰς ἡμέ-
    ρας αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἰσήνεγκε τοὺς κίονας τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ
16  τοὺς κίονας αὐτοῦ εἰσήνεγκεν εἰς τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου, ἀργυροῦς, καὶ
    χρυσοῦς, καὶ σκεύη. Καὶ πόλεμος ἦν ἀναμέσον Ἀσά, καὶ ἀνα-
17  μέσον Βαασὰ βασιλέως Ἰσραὴλ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας αὐτῶν. Καὶ
    ἀνέβη Βαασὰ βασιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ ἐπὶ Ἰούδαν, καὶ ᾠκοδόμησε τὴν
    Ῥαμά, τοῦ μὴ εἶναι ἐκπορευόμενον καὶ εἰσπορευόμενον τῷ Ἀσὰ
18  βασιλεῖ Ἰούδα. Καὶ ἔλαβεν Ἀσὰ σύμπαν τὸ ἀργύριον, καὶ τὸ
    χρυσίον τὸ εὑρεθὲν ἐν θησαυροῖς οἴκου Κυρίου, καὶ ἐν τοῖς θησαυ-
    ροῖς οἴκου τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὰ εἰς χεῖρας παίδων αὐ-
    τοῦ· καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν αὐτοὺς ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἀσὰ πρὸς υἱὸν Ἄδερ
    υἱοῦ Ταβὰ ἐν Ῥαμηά, υἱοῦ Ἀζὶν βασιλέως Συρίας τοῦ κατοικοῦν-
19  τος ἐν Δαμασκῷ, λέγων διάθου διαθήκην ἀναμέσον ἐμοῦ, καὶ ἀ-
    ναμέσον σοῦ, καὶ ἀναμέσον τοῦ πατρός μου, καὶ τοῦ πατρός σου·
    ἰδοὺ ἐξαπέσταλκά σοι δῶρον, ἀργύριον, καὶ χρυσίον· δεῦρο δια-
    σκέδασον τὴν διαθήκην σου τὴν πρὸς Βαασὰ βασιλέα Ἰσραήλ, καὶ
20  ἀναβήσεται ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ. Καὶ ἤκουσεν υἱὸς Ἄδερ τοῦ βασιλέως Ἀ-
    σά, καὶ ἀπέστειλε τοὺς ἄρχοντας τῶν δυνάμεων τῶν αὐτοῦ ταῖς
    πόλεσι τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ καὶ ἐπάταξε τὴν Ἀΐν, καὶ τὴν Δάν, καὶ τὴν
21  Ἀβὲλ οἴκου Μααχά, καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν Χενερέθ, ἕως πάσης τῆς γῆς
    Νεφθαλεί. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἤκουσε Βαασά, καὶ διέλιπε τοῦ οἰκο-
    δομεῖν τὴν Ῥαμά, καὶ ἀνέστρεψεν εἰς Θερσά. Καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς
    Ἀσὰ παρήγγειλε παντὶ τῷ λαῷ Ἰούδα εἰς Ἀναχειμ, καὶ αἴρουσι
    τοὺς λίθους τῆς Ῥαμά, καὶ τὰ ξύλα αὐτῆς, ἃ ᾠκοδόμησε Βαα-
