ΚΕΦ. Ηʹ. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Δʹ. 675
νήματα τοῦ ἀγροῦ, ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέρας ἧς ἐγκατέλιπε τὴν γῆν, ἕως
τοῦ νῦν. Καὶ ἦλθεν ᾿Ελισσαῖε εἰς Δαμασκὸν· καὶ υἱὸς ῎Αδερ βα- 7
σιλεὺς Συρίας ἠῤῥώστει. Καὶ ἀνήγγειλαν αὐτῷ, λέγοντες· ἥκει ὁ
ἄνθρωπος τοῦ Θεοῦ ἕως ὧδε. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς πρὸς ᾿Αζαήλ· 8
λάβε ἐν τῇ χειρί σου μαναὰ, καὶ δεῦρο εἰς ἀπάντησιν τοῦ ἀνθρώ-
που τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ ἐπιζήτησον τὸν Κύριον παρ᾿ αὐτοῦ, λέγων, εἰ
ζήσομαι ἐκ τῆς ἀῤῥωστίας μου ταύτης; Καὶ ἐπορεύθη ᾿Αζαὴλ εἰς 9
ἀπάντησιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔλαβε μαναὰ ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντα
τὰ ἀγαθὰ Δαμασκοῦ, ἄρσιν τεσσαράκοντα καμήλων, καὶ ἦλθε, καὶ
ἔστη ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς ᾿Ελισσαῖε· ὁ υἱός σου υἱὸς
῎Αδερ, βασιλεὺς Συρίας, ἀπέστειλέ με πρὸς σε, λέγων· εἰ ζήσομαι
ἐκ τῆς ἀῤῥωστίας μου ταύτης; Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτὸν ᾿Ελισσαῖε· 10
δεῦρο, εἶπον αὐτῷ, ζῶν ζήσῃ, καὶ ἔδειξέ μοι Κύριος ὅτι θανάτῳ
ἀποθανῇ. Καὶ παρέστη τῷ προσώπῳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔθηκεν ἕως αἰσχύ- 11
νης· καὶ ἔκλαυσεν ὁ ἄνθρωπος τοῦ Θεοῦ. Καὶ εἶπεν ᾿Αζαήλ· τί 12
ὅτι κύριός μου κλαίει; καὶ εἶπεν· ὅτι οἶδα ὅσα ποιήσεις τοῖς υἱοῖς
᾿Ισραὴλ κακά· τὰ ὀχυρώματα αὐτῶν ἐξαποστελεῖς ἐν πυρὶ, καὶ τοὺς
ἐκλεκτοὺς αὐτῶν ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ ἀποκτενεῖς, καὶ τὰ νήπια αὐτῶν ἐν-
σεισεις, καὶ τὰς ἐν γαστρὶ ἐχούσας αὐτῶν ἀναῤῥήξεις. Καὶ εἶ- 13
πεν ᾿Αζαήλ· τίς ἐστιν ὁ δοῦλός σου (ὦ κύριε) ὁ κύων ὁ τεθνηκώς,
ὅτι ποιήσει τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο; καὶ εἶπεν ᾿Ελισσαῖε· ἔδειξέ μοι Κύριος
σὲ βασιλεύοντα ἐπὶ Συρίαν. Καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ἀπὸ ᾿Ελισσαῖε, καὶ εἰσ- 14
ῆλθε πρὸς τὸν κύριον αὐτοῦ· καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· ὅ,τι εἶπέ σοι ᾿Ελισ-
σαῖε; Καὶ εἶπεν· εἰπέ μοι, ζωῇ ζήσῃ. Καὶ ἐγένετο τῇ ἐπαύριον, 15
καὶ ἔλαβε τὸ Μαχδὰρ, καὶ ἔβαψεν ἐν τῷ ὕδατι, καὶ περιέβαλεν ἐπὶ
τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀπέθανε· καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν ᾿Αζαὴλ ἀντ᾿ αὐ-
τοῦ. ᾿Εν ἔτει πέμπτῳ τοῦ ᾿Ιωρὰμ υἱοῦ ᾿Αχαὰβ βασιλέως ᾿Ισραὴλ, 16
καὶ ᾿Ιωσαφὰτ βασιλέως ᾿Ιούδα, (καὶ) ἐβασίλευσεν ᾿Ιωρὰμ υἱὸς ᾿Ιω-
σαφὰτ βασιλέως ᾿Ιούδα. Υἱὸς τριάκοντα καὶ δύο ἐτῶν ἦν ἐν τῷ 17
βασιλεύειν αὐτόν, καὶ ὀκτὼ ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν ᾿Ιερουσαλήμ. Καὶ 18
ἐπορεύθη ἐν ὁδῷ βασιλέων ᾿Ισραὴλ, καθὼς ἐποίησεν οἶκος ᾿Αχαὰβ,
ὅτι θυγάτηρ ᾿Αχαὰβ ἦν αὐτῷ εἰς γυναῖκα, καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ πονη-

λύχνον, καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ, πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας. ᾿Εν ταῖς ἡμέ- 20

**7** And Elisha came to Damascus; and the son of Ader, king of Syria, was sick. And they told him, saying, "The man of God is come hither."
**8** And the king said unto Hazael, "Take in thy hand manaa, and go to meet the man of God, and inquire of the Lord by him, saying, 'Shall I live of this my sickness?'"
**9** And Hazael went to meet him, and took manaa in his hand, and all the good things of Damascus, a burden of forty camels, and came, and stood before him, and said unto Elisha, "Thy son, the son of Ader, king of Syria, hath sent me to thee, saying, 'Shall I live of this my sickness?'"
**10** And Elisha said unto him, "Go, say unto him, 'Thou shalt surely live,' but the Lord hath shown me that he shall surely die."
**11** And he fixed his gaze upon him, until [Hazael] was confounded; and the man of God wept.
**12** And Hazael said, "Why doth my lord weep?" And he answered, "Because I know the evils that thou shalt do unto the children of Israel: their strongholds shalt thou cast into the fire, and their choice young men shalt thou slay with the sword, and their infants shalt thou dash in pieces, and their women with child shalt thou rip open."
**13** And Hazael said, "What is thy servant (O lord), a dead dog, that he should do this thing?" And Elisha said, "The Lord hath shown me that thou shalt be king over Syria."
**14** And he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; and he said unto him, "What said Elisha unto thee?" And he answered, "He told me, 'Thou shalt surely live.'"
**15** And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took the Machdar, and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, and he died; and Hazael reigned in his stead.
**16** In the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab, king of Israel, (and) of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, did Joram the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, begin to reign.
**17** He was thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
**18** And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab, for the daughter of Ahab was his wife, and he did evil in the sight of the Lord.
**19** Yet the Lord would not destroy Judah for David His servant's sake, as He had promised him to give him a lamp, and to his children, for all days.
**20** In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and
