**16** τοῦ πατρός μου, καὶ ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτοῦ ἐπλήρωσε, λέγων· Ἀφ’ ἧς ἡμέρας ἐξήγαγον τὸν λαόν μου τὸν Ἰσραὴλ ἐξ Αἰγύπτου, οὐκ ἐξελεξάμην ἐν πόλει ἐν ἑνὶ σκήπτρῳ Ἰσραὴλ τοῦ οἰκοδομῆσαι οἶκον, τοῦ εἶναι τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐκεῖ· καὶ ἐξελεξάμην τὸν Δαυὶδ τοῦ
**17** εἶναι ἐπὶ τὸν λαόν μου, τὸν Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐπὶ τῆς καρδίας Δαυὶδ τοῦ πατρός μου οἰκοδομῆσαι οἶκον τῷ ὀνόματι Κυρίου
**18** Θεοῦ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Δαυὶδ τὸν πατέρα μου, Ἀνθ’ ὧν ἦλθεν ἐπὶ τὴν καρδίαν σου οἰκοδομῆσαι οἶκον τῷ ὀνόματί μου,
**19** καλῶς ἐποίησας ὅτι ἐγενήθη ἐπὶ τὴν καρδίαν σου. Πλὴν οὐ σὺ οἰκοδομήσεις τὸν οἶκον, ἀλλ’ ὁ υἱός σου ὁ ἐξελθὼν ἐκ τῶν πλευρῶν σου,
**20** οὗτος οἰκοδομήσει τὸν οἶκον τῷ ὀνόματί μου. Καὶ ἀνέστησε Κύριος τὸ ῥῆμα αὐτοῦ ὃ ἐλάλησε, καὶ ἀνέστην ἀντὶ Δαυὶδ τοῦ πατρός μου, καὶ ἐκάθισα ἐπὶ τοῦ θρόνου Ἰσραήλ, καθὼς ἐλάλησε Κύριος, καὶ ᾠκοδόμησα τὸν οἶκον τῷ ὀνόματι Κυρίου Θεοῦ
**21** Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἐθέμην ἐκεῖ τόπον τῇ κιβωτῷ, ἐν ᾗ ἐστὶν ἐκεῖ διαθήκη Κυρίου, ἣν διέθετο Κύριος μετὰ τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν ἐν τῷ ἐξαγαγεῖν αὐτὸν αὐτοὺς ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου.
**22** Καὶ ἔστη Σαλωμὼν κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου Κυρίου ἐνώπιον πάσης ἐκκλησίας Ἰσραήλ, καὶ διεπέτασε τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν,
**23** καὶ εἶπε· Κύριε ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ, οὐκ ἔστιν ὡς σὺ Θεὸς ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ ἄνω, καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς κάτω, φυλάσσων διαθήκην καὶ ἔλεος τῷ
**24** δούλῳ σου τῷ πορευομένῳ ἐνώπιόν σου ἐν ὅλῃ καρδίᾳ αὐτῷ, Ἃ ἐφύλαξας τῷ δούλῳ σου Δαυὶδ τῷ πατρί μου, ὅσα ἐλάλησας αὐτῷ· καὶ ἐλάλησας ἐν στόματί σου, καὶ ἐν χερσί σου ἐπλήρωσας,
**25** ὡς ἡ ἡμέρα αὕτη. Καὶ νῦν, Κύριε ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ, φύλαξον τῷ δούλῳ σου Δαυὶδ τῷ πατρί μου ἃ ἐλάλησας αὐτῷ, λέγων· Οὐκ ἐξαρθήσεταί σου ἀνὴρ ἐκ προσώπου μου καθήμενος ἐπὶ θρόνου Ἰσραήλ, πλὴν ἐὰν φυλάξωνται τὰ τέκνα σου τὰς ὁδοὺς αὐτῶν, τοῦ
**26** πορεύεσθαι ἐνώπιόν μου καθὼς ἐπορεύθης ἐνώπιον ἐμοῦ. Καὶ νῦν, Κύριε ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ, πιστωθείτω δὴ τὸ ῥῆμά σου, ὃ ἐλάλησας τῷ δούλῳ σου Δαυίδ, τῷ πατρί μου.
**27** Ὅτι εἰ ἀληθῶς κατοικήσει Θεὸς μετὰ ἀνθρώπων ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς; εἰ ὁ οὐρανός, καὶ οὐρανὸς τοῦ οὐρανοῦ οὐκ ἀρκέσουσί σοι, πλὴν καὶ ὁ οἶκος οὗτος ὃν ᾠκοδόμησα;
**28** Καὶ ἐπιβλέψῃ ἐπὶ προσευχὴν δούλου σου καὶ τὴν δέησίν μου, ὦ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ, ἀκούειν τῆς δεήσεως, καὶ τῆς προσευχῆς ἧς ὁ δοῦλός σου προσεύχεται ἐνώπιόν σου πρὸς σὲ σήμερον, Τοῦ εἶναι ὀφ-

### A Royal Translation of the Third Book of Kingdoms, Chapter 8

**16** my father, and with His own hands He brought it to fulfillment, saying: 'From the day I brought My people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city within any tribe of Israel wherein to build a House, that My Name might be there; but I chose David
**17** to be over My people, Israel.' And it was in the heart of David my father to build a House for the Name of the Lord
**18** God of Israel. And the Lord said to David my father, 'Forasmuch as it was in your heart to build a House for My Name,
**19** you have done well that it was in your heart. Nevertheless, you shall not build the House, but your son who shall come forth from your loins,
**20** he shall build the House for My Name.' And the Lord has established His word which He spoke; and I have risen in place of David my father, and I have sat on the throne of Israel, as the Lord spoke, and I have built the House for the Name of the Lord God
**21** of Israel. And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of the Lord, which the Lord made with our fathers when He brought them out of the land of Egypt.
**22** And Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven,
**23** and he said: 'O Lord God of Israel, there is no God like You, in heaven above or on earth beneath, who keeps covenant and mercy with Your
**24** servant who walks before You with all his heart, which You have kept to Your servant David my father, all that You spoke to him; and You spoke with Your mouth, and with Your hands You have fulfilled [it],
**25** as it is this day. Now therefore, O Lord God of Israel, keep for Your servant David my father that which You spoke to him, saying: "There shall not fail you a man from My presence to sit upon the throne of Israel, unless your children keep their ways,
**26** to walk before Me as you have walked before Me." And now, O Lord God of Israel, let Your word, which You spoke to Your servant David my father, be confirmed.
**27** But will God truly dwell with mankind upon the earth? Behold, the heaven, and the heaven of heavens, cannot contain You; how much less this House which I have built?
**28** Yet have regard unto the prayer of Your servant and to my supplication, O God of Israel, [and] hearken to the supplication and to the prayer which Your servant offers before You this day, that Your [eyes may be open...]
