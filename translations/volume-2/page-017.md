σαν εἰς Μασσηφάθ, καὶ ὑδρεύονταν ὕδωρ, καὶ ἐξέχεαν ἐνώπιον
Κυρίου ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν· καὶ ἐνήστευσαν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, καὶ εἶ-
παν· ἡμαρτήκαμεν ἐνώπιον Κυρίου. Καὶ ἐδίκαζε Σαμουὴλ τοὺς
υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ εἰς Μασσηφάθ. Καὶ ἤκουσαν ἀλλόφυλοι ὅτι συνη- 7
θροίσθησαν πάντες οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ εἰς Μασσηφάθ, καὶ ἀνέβησαν
σατράπαι ἀλλοφύλων ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ· καὶ ἀκούουσιν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ,
καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν ἀπὸ προσώπου ἀλλοφύλων. Καὶ εἶπαν υἱοὶ Ἰσ- 8
ραὴλ πρὸς Σαμουήλ· μὴ παρασιωπήσῃς ἀφ᾿ ἡμῶν, τοῦ μὴ βοᾷν
πρὸς Κύριον Θεόν σου, καὶ σώσει ἡμᾶς ἐκ χειρὸς ἀλλοφύλων.
Καὶ ἔλαβε Σαμουὴλ ἄρνα γαλαθηνὸν ἕνα, καὶ ἀνήνεγκεν αὐτὸν 9
ὁλοκαύτωσιν σὺν παντὶ τῷ λαῷ τῷ Κυρίῳ· καὶ ἐβόησε Σαμουὴλ
πρὸς Κύριον περὶ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐπήκουσεν αὐτοῦ Κύριος. Καὶ 10
ἦν Σαμουὴλ ἀναφέρων τὴν ὁλοκαύτωσιν, καὶ ἀλλόφυλοι προσῆγον
εἰς πόλεμον ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ· καὶ ἐβρόντησε Κύριος ἐν φωνῇ με-
γάλῃ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀλλοφύλους, καὶ συνεχύθησαν,
καὶ ἔπταισαν ἐνώπιον Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἐξῆλθον ἄνδρες Ἰσραὴλ ἐκ 11
Μασσηφάθ, καὶ κατεδίωξαν τοὺς ἀλλοφύλους, καὶ ἐπάταξαν αὐ-
τοὺς ἕως ὑποκάτω τοῦ Βεθχόρ. Καὶ ἔλαβε Σαμουὴλ λίθον ἕνα, 12
καὶ ἔστησεν αὐτὸν ἀναμέσον Μασσηφάθ καὶ ἀναμέσον τῆς παλαι-
ᾶς· καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ἀβενέζερ, λίθος τοῦ βοηθοῦ·
καὶ εἶπεν· ἕως ἐνταῦθα ἐβοήθησεν ἡμῖν Κύριος. Καὶ ἐταπείνω- 13
σε Κύριος τοὺς ἀλλοφύλους, καὶ οὐ προσέθεντο ἔτι ἐπελθεῖν εἰς ὅρι-
ον Ἰσραήλ· καὶ ἐγένετο χεὶρ Κυρίου ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀλλοφύλους πά-
σας τὰς ἡμέρας Σαμουήλ. Καὶ ἀπεδόθησαν αἱ πόλεις ἃς ἔλα- 14
βον οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι παρὰ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἀπέδωκαν αὐτὰς
τῷ Ἰσραήλ, ἀπὸ Ἀκκαρὼν ἕως Γέθ, καὶ τὸ ὅριον Ἰσραὴλ ἀφεί-
λαντο ἐκ χειρὸς ἀλλοφύλων· καὶ ἦν εἰρήνη ἀναμέσον Ἰσραὴλ καὶ
ἀναμέσον τοῦ Ἀμοῤῥαίου. Καὶ ἐδίκαζε Σαμουὴλ τὸν Ἰσραὴλ 15
πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς ζωῆς αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐπορεύετο κατ᾿ ἐνιαυτὸν 16
ἐνιαυτόν, καὶ ἐκύκλου Βαιθήλ καὶ τὴν Γαλγαλᾶ καὶ τὴν Μασ-
σηφάθ· καὶ ἐδίκαζε τὸν Ἰσραὴλ ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς ἡγιασμένοις τούτοις.
Ἡ δὲ ἀποστροφὴ αὐτοῦ εἰς Ἀρμαθαΐμ, ὅτι ἐκεῖ ἦν ὁ οἶκος αὐ- 17
τοῦ· καὶ ἐδίκαζεν ἐκεῖ τὸν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν ἐκεῖ θυσια-
στήριον τῷ Κυρίῳ.

**Chapter 7**

6
[And they were gathered] unto Mizpah, and drew water, and poured it out before the Lord upon the earth; and they fasted on that day, and said, "We have sinned before the Lord." And Samuel judged the sons of Israel in Mizpah.

7
Now when the Philistines heard that all the sons of Israel were gathered unto Mizpah, the satraps of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the sons of Israel heard [thereof], they were afraid before the face of the Philistines.

8
And the sons of Israel said unto Samuel, "Cease not to cry out for us unto the Lord our God, that He may save us from the hand of the Philistines."

9
Then Samuel took a single suckling lamb, and offered it up for a whole burnt offering unto the Lord, with all the people; and Samuel cried unto the Lord for Israel, and the Lord heard him.

10
Now it came to pass, as Samuel was offering up the whole burnt offering, that the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel. But the Lord thundered with a mighty voice on that day upon the Philistines, and they were confounded, and were smitten before Israel.

11
Then the men of Israel went out of Mizpah, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them even unto the region beneath Bethchor.

12
And Samuel took a single stone, and set it up between Mizpah and between the Old Place; and he called the name thereof Abenezer, [saying], "A Stone of the Helper"; for he said, "Hitherto hath the Lord helped us."

13
Thus the Lord humbled the Philistines, and they added not again to come into the border of Israel; and the hand of the Lord was upon the Philistines all the days of Samuel.

14
And the cities, which the Philistines had taken from the sons of Israel, were restored; and they gave them back unto Israel, from Akkarōn even unto Geth. And the border of Israel did [Israel's people] deliver out of the hand of the Philistines; and there was peace between Israel and between the Amorite.

15
And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.

16
And he went yearly from circuit to circuit, and journeyed through Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpah; and he judged Israel in all these hallowed places.

17
But his return [was ever] unto Ramathaim, for there was his house; and there he judged Israel, and there he built an altar unto the Lord.
