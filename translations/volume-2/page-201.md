τὸ παιδάριον, ὁ προφήτης, εἰς ῾Ραμὼθ Γαλαάδ, καὶ εἰσῆλθε. Καὶ 5
ἰδοὺ οἱ ἄρχοντες τῆς δυνάμεως ἐκάθηντο, καὶ εἶπεν· λόγος μοι πρὸς
σέ, ὁ ἄρχων· καὶ εἶπεν ᾿Ιηοῦ· πρός τίνα ἐκ πάντων ἡμῶν; καὶ
εἶπεν· πρὸς σέ, ὁ ἄρχων. Καὶ ἀνέστη, καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸν οἶκον, 6
καὶ ἐπέχεεν τὸ ἔλαιον ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ·
τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ᾿Ισραήλ· κέχρικά σε εἰς βασιλέα ἐπὶ τὸν
λαὸν Κυρίου, ἐπὶ τὸν ᾿Ισραήλ. Καὶ ἐξολεθρεύσεις τὸν οἶκον ᾿Αχαὰβ 7
τοῦ κυρίου σου ἐκ προσώπου μου, καὶ ἐκδικήσεις τὰ αἵματα τῶν
δούλων μου τῶν προφητῶν, καὶ τὰ αἵματα πάντων τῶν δούλων Κυ-
ρίου ἐκ χειρὸς ᾿Ιεζάβελ, καὶ ἐκ χειρὸς ὅλου τοῦ οἴκου ᾿Αχαάβ, 8
καὶ ἐξολεθρεύσεις τοῦ οἴκου ᾿Αχαὰβ οὐροῦντα πρὸς τοῖχον, καὶ συν-
εχόμενον, καὶ ἐγκαταλελειμμένον ἐν ᾿Ισραήλ· καὶ δώσω τὸν οἶκον 9
τοῦ ᾿Αχαὰβ ὡς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ ῾Ιεροβοὰμ υἱοῦ Ναβάτ, καὶ ὡς τὸν
οἶκον Βαασσὰ υἱοῦ ᾿Αχιά. Καὶ τὴν ᾿Ιεζάβελ καταφάγονται οἱ κύνες 10
ἐν τῇ μερίδι τοῦ ᾿Ιεζράελ, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ὁ θάπτων. καὶ ἤνοιξε
τὴν θύραν, καὶ ἔφυγε. Καὶ ᾿Ιηοῦ ἐξῆλθε πρὸς τοὺς παῖδας τοῦ κυ- 11
ρίου αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπον αὐτῷ· εἰρήνη; τί ὅτι εἰσῆλθεν ὁ ἐπίληπτος
οὗτος πρὸς σέ; καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· ὑμεῖς οἴδατε τὸν ἄνδρα, καὶ τὴν
ἀδολεσχίαν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπον· ἄδικον· ἀπάγγειλον δὴ ἡμῖν. Καὶ 12
εἶπεν ᾿Ιηοῦ πρὸς αὐτούς· οὕτως καὶ οὕτως ἐλάλησε πρὸς μέ, λέ-
γων· τάδε λέγει Κύριος, κέχρικά σε εἰς βασιλέα ἐπὶ ᾿Ισραήλ. Καὶ 13
ἀκούσαντες ἔσπευσαν, καὶ ἔλαβον ἕκαστος τὸ ἱμάτιον αὐτοῦ, καὶ
ἔθηκαν ὑποκάτω αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὸ Γαρὲμ τῶν ἀναβαθμῶν (ἐκάθηντο)·
καὶ ἐσάλπισαν ἐν κερατίνῃ, καὶ εἶπον· ἐβασίλευσεν ᾿Ιηοῦ. Καὶ συν- 14
εστράφη ᾿Ιηοῦ υἱὸς ᾿Ιωσαφὰτ υἱοῦ Ναμεσσὶ πρὸς ᾿Ιωράμ. καὶ ᾿Ιω-
ρὰμ αὐτὸς ἐφύλασσεν ἐν ῾Ραμὼθ Γαλαάδ, αὐτὸς καὶ πᾶς ᾿Ισραὴλ
ἀπὸ προσώπου ᾿Αζαὴλ βασιλέως Συρίας. Καὶ ἀπέστρεψεν ὁ βα- 15
σιλεὺς ᾿Ιωρὰμ ἰατρευθῆναι ἐν ᾿Ιεζράελ ἀπὸ τῶν πληγῶν, ὧν ἔπαι-
σαν αὐτὸν οἱ Σῦροι ἐν τῷ πολεμεῖν αὐτὸν μετὰ ᾿Αζαὴλ βασιλέως
Συρίας. καὶ εἶπεν ᾿Ιηοῦ· εἰ ἔστι ψυχὴ ὑμῶν μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ, μὴ ἐξελ-
θέτω διαπεφευγὼς ἐκ τῆς πόλεως τοῦ πορευθῆναι, καὶ ἀπαγγεί-
λαι ἐν ᾿Ιεζράελ. Καὶ ἵππευσεν ᾿Ιηοῦ, καὶ ἐπορεύθη, καὶ κατέβη 16
εἰς ᾿Ιεζράελ, ὅτι ᾿Ιωρὰμ βασιλεὺς ᾿Ισραὴλ ἐθεραπεύετο ἐν ᾿Ιεζράελ
ἀπὸ τῶν τοξευμάτων, ὧν κατετόξευσαν αὐτὸν οἱ ᾿Αραμὶμ ἐν τῇ
῾Ραμμαθ, ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ μετὰ ᾿Αζαὴλ βασιλέως Συρίας, ὅτι αὐ-

**CHAPTER NINE.**

**5** The lad, [even] the prophet, went unto Ramoth-Gilead, and he came in. And behold, the captains of the host were sitting, and he said, "A word have I unto thee, O captain." And Jehu said, "Unto which one of all of us?" And he said, "Unto thee, O captain."
**6** And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil upon his head, and said unto him, "Thus saith the LORD God of Israel: 'I have anointed thee king over the people of the LORD, over Israel.
**7** And thou shalt utterly destroy the house of Ahab thy master from before My face, and thou shalt avenge the blood of My servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD from the hand of Jezebel, and from the hand of all the house of Ahab.
**8** And thou shalt utterly destroy from the house of Ahab every male, whether confined or left behind in Israel; and I will make the house of Ahab as the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and as the house of Baasha the son of Ahiah.
**10** And the dogs shall devour Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her.'" And he opened the door, and fled.
**11** Then Jehu came forth unto the servants of his master; and they said unto him, "Is all well? Wherefore came this madman unto thee?" And he said unto them, "Ye know the man, and his idle talk."
**12** And they said, "[Nay, it is] not so; declare unto us now." And Jehu said unto them, "Thus and thus spake he unto me, saying, 'Thus saith the LORD: I have anointed thee king over Israel.'"
**13** And when they heard, they made haste, and took every man his garment, and put them under him upon the highest step of the stairs, (where they were sitting); and they blew with the trumpet, and said, "Jehu is king!"
**14** So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Namessi, conspired against Joram. Now Joram himself was keeping watch in Ramoth-Gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria.
**15** And King Joram had returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds, which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria. And Jehu said, "If your heart be with me, let none escape out of the city to go and tell it in Jezreel."
**16** And Jehu rode, and went, and came down to Jezreel, for Joram king of Israel was being healed in Jezreel of the arrows which the Arameans had shot at him in Rammath, in the war with Hazael king of Syria, for he himself was mighty, and a man of power rested there. And Ahaziah king of Judah...
