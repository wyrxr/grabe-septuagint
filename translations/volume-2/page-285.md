ΚΕΦ. ΚΗ΄. XXVIII.

`1` Καὶ ἐξεκλησίασε Δαυὶδ πάντας τοὺς ἄρχοντας Ἰσραήλ, ἄρχοντας
    τῶν κριτῶν, καὶ πάντας τοὺς ἄρχοντας τῶν ἐφημεριῶν τῶν περὶ
    τὸ σῶμα τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ ἄρχοντας τῶν χιλιάδων καὶ τῶν ἑκα-
    τοντάδων, καὶ τοὺς γαζοφύλακας, καὶ τοὺς ἐπὶ τῶν ὑπαρχόντων
    αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάσης τῆς κτήσεως τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ
    σὺν τοῖς εὐνούχοις, καὶ τοὺς δυνάστας, καὶ τοὺς μαχητὰς τῆς
    στρατιᾶς ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ.
`2` Καὶ ἔστη Δαυὶδ ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐν μέσῳ τῆς ἐκκλησίας, καὶ εἶπεν˙
    ἀκούσατέ μου, ἀδελφοί μου, καὶ λαός μου˙ ἐμοὶ ἐγένετο ἐπὶ καρ-
    δίαν οἰκοδομῆσαι οἶκον ἀναπαύσεως τῆς κιβωτοῦ διαθήκης Κυ-
    ρίου, καὶ στάσιν ποδῶν Κυρίου ἡμῶν, καὶ ἑτοίμασα τὰ εἰς τὴν
    κατασκήνωσιν ἐπιτήδεια.
`3` Καὶ ὁ Θεὸς εἶπεν˙ οὐκ οἰκοδομήσεις ἐμοὶ οἶκον τοῦ ἐπονομάσαι
    τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ, ὅτι ἄνθρωπος πολεμιστὴς εἶ σύ, καὶ αἵματα
    ἐξέχεας˙
`4` καὶ ἐξελέξατο Κύριος ὁ Θεός Ἰσραὴλ ἐν ἐμοὶ ἀπὸ παντὸς οἴκου
    τοῦ πατρός μου εἶναι βασιλέα ἐπὶ Ἰσραὴλ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, καὶ ἐν
    Ἰούδα ἡρέτικε τὸ βασίλειον, καὶ ἐξ οἴκου Ἰούδα τὸν οἶκον τοῦ πα-
    τρός μου˙ καὶ ἐν τοῖς υἱοῖς τοῦ πατρός μου, ἐν ἐμοὶ ἠθέλησε τοῦ
    γενέσθαι με εἰς βασιλέα ἐπὶ τῷ παντὶ Ἰσραήλ˙
`5` καὶ ἀπὸ πάντων υἱῶν μου, ὅτι πολλοὺς υἱοὺς δέδωκέ μοι Κύριος,
    ἐξελέξατο ἐν Σαλωμῶν τῷ υἱῷ μου καθίσαι αὐτὸν ἐπὶ θρόνου βα-
    σιλείας Κυρίου, ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ.
`6` Καὶ εἶπέ μοι ὁ Θεός˙ Σαλωμὼν ὁ υἱός σου οἰκοδομήσει τὸν οἶκόν
    μου, καὶ τὴν αὐλήν μου, ὅτι ἡρέτικα ἐν αὐτῷ εἶναί μου υἱόν, κἀγὼ
    ἔσομαι αὐτῷ εἰς πατέρα˙
`7` καὶ κατορθώσω τὴν βασιλείαν αὐτοῦ ἕως αἰῶνος, ἐὰν ἰσχύσῃ τοῦ
    φυλάξασθαι τὰς ἐντολὰς μου, καὶ τὰ κρίματά μου· ὡς ἡ ἡμέρα αὕτη·

    And over the camels was Obias the Ishmaelite;
`30` and over the donkeys, Iadias, who was from Marathon.
    And over the flocks of sheep was Iozez the
`31` Hagarite. All these were the chief officers over the possessions of David the king.

`32` And Jonathan, David's paternal uncle, was a counselor, a man of understanding, and he himself was a scribe. And Ieriel, the son of Achamani, was with the sons of the king.
`33` And Ahitophel was the king's counselor, and Chusi was the king's chief friend.
`34` And after Ahitophel, [there followed] Ioadah, the son of Banaiah, and Abiathar. And Joab was the commander-in-chief of the king's host.

**CHAPTER XXVIII.**

`1` And David gathered together all the princes of Israel: the princes of the judges, and all the princes of the courses who were about the king's person, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and the treasurers, and those that were over his possessions, and over all the king's property, and his sons with the eunuchs, and the mighty men, and the warriors of the army in Jerusalem.
`2` And David the king stood in the midst of the congregation, and said: "Hearken unto me, my brethren, and my people! It was in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and for the footstool of our Lord, and I prepared the needful things for the dwelling.
`3` But God said unto me: 'Thou shalt not build Me an house to put My Name upon it, for thou art a man of war, and hast shed much blood.'
`4` Howbeit the Lord God of Israel chose me out of all the house of my father to be king over Israel for evermore; and in Judah hath He chosen the kingdom, and out of the house of Judah, the house of my father. And among the sons of my father, in me He hath willed that I should become king over all Israel.
`5` And from among all my sons (for the Lord hath given me many sons), He hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the Lord, over Israel.
`6` And God said unto me: 'Solomon thy son, he shall build My house and My court, for I have chosen him to be My son, and I will be unto him a Father.
`7` And I will establish his kingdom forever, if he be strong to keep My commandments and My judgments, as on this day.'
