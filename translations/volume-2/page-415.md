1 ἈΝΘΡΩΠΟΣ ἦν ἐν χώρᾳ τῇ Αὐσίτιδι, ᾧ ὄνομα Ἰώβ· καὶ
ἦν ὁ ἄνθρωπος ἐκεῖνος ἄμεμπτος, δίκαιος, καὶ ἀληθινός, καὶ θεοσεβής,
ἀπεχόμενος ἀπὸ παντὸς πονηροῦ πράγματος.
2 Ἐγένοντο δὲ αὐτῷ υἱοὶ ἑπτά, καὶ θυγατέρες τρεῖς·
3 καὶ ἦν τὰ κτήνη αὐτοῦ πρόβατα ἑπτακισχίλια, κάμηλοι τρισχίλιοι, ζεύγη
βοῶν πεντακόσια, καὶ ὄνοι θήλειαι νομάδες πεντακόσιοι, καὶ ὑπηρεσία πολλὴ
σφόδρα, καὶ ἔργα μεγάλα ἦν αὐτῷ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς· καὶ ἦν ὁ ἄνθρωπος
ἐκεῖνος εὐγενὴς τῶν ἀφ’ ἡλίου ἀνατολῶν.
4 Συμπορευόμενοι δὲ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ πρὸς ἀλλήλους, ἐποίουν πότον καθ’
ἑκάστην ἡμέραν, συμπαραλαμβάνοντες (ἅμα) καὶ τὰς τρεῖς ἀδελφὰς αὐτῶν,
ἐσθίειν καὶ πίνειν μετ’ αὐτῶν.
5 Καὶ ὡς ἂν συνετελέσθησαν αἱ ἡμέραι τοῦ πότου, ἀπέστειλεν Ἰώβ, καὶ
ἐκαθάριζεν αὐτούς, ἀνιστάμενος τὸ πρωΐ· προσέφερέ τε θυσίας περὶ αὐτῶν
κατὰ τὸν ἀριθμὸν αὐτῶν, καὶ μόσχον ἕνα περὶ ἁμαρτίας ὑπὲρ τῶν ψυχῶν
αὐτῶν. Ἔλεγε γὰρ Ἰώβ· μήποτε οἱ υἱοί μου ἥμαρτον, καὶ ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ
αὐτῶν κακὰ ἐνενόησαν πρὸς τὸν Θεόν. Οὕτως ἐποίει Ἰὼβ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας
(αὐτῶν).
6 Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἡ ἡμέρα αὕτη, καὶ ἦλθον οἱ ἄγγελοι τοῦ Θεοῦ
παραστῆναι ἐνώπιον τοῦ Κυρίου· καὶ ὁ διάβολος ἦλθε μετ’ αὐτῶν,
περιελθὼν τὴν γῆν, καὶ ἐμπεριπατήσας τὴν ὑπ’ οὐρανόν.
7 Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ Κύριος πρὸς τὸν διάβολον· πόθεν παραγέγονας; καὶ
ἀποκριθεὶς ὁ διάβολος τῷ Κυρίῳ, εἶπε· περιελθὼν τὴν γῆν, καὶ
ἐμπεριπατήσας τὴν ὑπ’ οὐρανόν, πάρεμι.
8 Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Κύριος· προσέσχες τῇ διανοίᾳ σου κατὰ τοῦ παιδός μου
Ἰώβ; ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν (ἄνθρωπος) ὅμοιος αὐτῷ τῶν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, ἄνθρωπος
ἄμεμπτος (δίκαιος), ἀληθινός, θεοσεβής, ἀπεχόμενος ἀπὸ παντὸς πονηροῦ
πράγματος.
9 Ἀπεκρίθη δὲ ὁ διάβολος ἐναντίον Κυρίου, καὶ εἶπε· μὴ δωρεὰν Ἰὼβ
σέβεται τὸν Θεόν;
10 Οὐ σὺ περιέφραξας αὐτοῦ τὰ ἔξω, καὶ τὰ ἔσω τῆς οἰκίας αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰ
ἔξωθεν πάντων τῶν ὄντων αὐτῷ κυκλόθεν; τὰ (δὲ) ἔργα τῶν χειρῶν αὐτοῦ

### The Book of Job

**Chapter 1**

1 There was a man in the land of Ausitis, whose name was Job; and that man
was blameless, righteous, and true, and God-fearing, abstaining from every
evil deed.
2 And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.
3 And his possessions were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five
hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses [for] pasture; and his
service was exceeding great, and great works had he upon the earth; and
that man was most noble among them of the East.
4 And his sons went and feasted in one another's houses, making a feast on
each day, taking (together) also their three sisters to eat and to drink
with them.
5 And it came to pass, when the days of their feasting were ended, that
Job did send and purify them, rising up early in the morning; and he
offered sacrifices for them, according to their number, and one calf for a
sin offering for their souls. For Job said, “Lest peradventure my sons have
sinned, and in their heart have thought evil things against God.” Thus did
Job continually [perform these rites] all their days.
6 And it came to pass on a certain day, that the angels of God came to
present themselves before the Lord; and the devil came also among them,
having gone round about the earth, and having walked about under heaven.
7 And the Lord said unto the devil, “Whence comest thou?” And the devil
answered the Lord, and said, “I have gone round about the earth, and walked
about under heaven, [and] I am present.”
8 And the Lord said unto him, “Hast thou considered My servant Job in thy
mind? for there is none (man) like him upon the earth, a man blameless
(righteous), true, God-fearing, abstaining from every evil deed.”
9 Then the devil answered the Lord, and said, “Doth Job worship God for
naught?
10 Hast thou not hedged him about, [even] his outward [estate], and the
inward things of his house, and the outward [parts] of all his possessions
round about? The works (now) of his hands
