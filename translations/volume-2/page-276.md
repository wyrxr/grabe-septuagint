**I CHRONICLES XXII.**

**3** of the doors, and of the gates, and for the hinges thereof, did David prepare;
**4** and much brass, whereof there was no weight. And cedar timbers, without number; for the Sidonians and the Tyrians did bring much cedar timber unto David.
**5** Then David said, "Solomon my son is a tender youth, and the House which is to be built for the LORD [must be] of exceeding greatness, for [His] Name and for glory throughout all the earth. Therefore will I prepare for him." So David prepared abundantly before his death.
