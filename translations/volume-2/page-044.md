ΚΕΦ. ΙΘʹ.
**8** Καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτοὺς πληγὴν μεγάλην σφόδρα, καὶ ἔφυγον ἐκ προσώπου αὐτοῦ.
**9** Καὶ ἐγένετο πνεῦμα Κυρίου πονηρὸν ἐπὶ Σαούλ, καὶ αὐτὸς ἐν οἴκῳ καθεύδων, καὶ δόρυ ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἰδοὺ Δαυὶδ ἔψαλλεν ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτοῦ.
**10** Καὶ ἐζήτει Σαοὺλ πατάξαι τὸ δόρυ εἰς Δαυὶδ καὶ ἐν τῷ τοίχῳ, καὶ ἀπέστη Δαυὶδ ἐκ προσώπου Σαούλ· καὶ ἐπάταξε τὸ δόρυ εἰς τὸν τοῖχον,
**11** καὶ Δαυὶδ ἀνεχώρησε, καὶ διεσώθη. Καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐν τῇ νυκτὶ ἐκείνῃ, καὶ ἀπέστειλε Σαοὺλ ἀγγέλους εἰς οἶκον Δαυὶδ φυλάξαι αὐτὸν τοῦ θανατῶσαι αὐτὸν πρωΐ, καὶ ἀπήγγειλε τῷ Δαυὶδ Μελχὸλ ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ, λέγουσα· ἐὰν μὴ σὺ σώσῃς τὴν ψυχὴν σεαυτοῦ τὴν νύκτα ταύτην, αὔριον θανατωθήσῃ.
**12** Καὶ κατάγει ἡ Μελχὸλ τὸν Δαυὶδ διὰ τῆς θυρίδος, καὶ ἀπῆλθε, καὶ ἔφυγε, καὶ σώζεται.
**13** Καὶ ἔλαβεν ἡ Μελχὸλ τὰ κενοτάφια, καὶ ἔθηκεν ἐπὶ τὴν κλίνην, καὶ ἧπαρ τῶν αἰγῶν ἔθετο πρὸς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐκάλυψεν αὐτὰ ἱματίῳ.
**14** Καὶ ἀποστέλλει Σαοὺλ ἀγγέλους λαβεῖν τὸν Δαυίδ, καὶ λέγουσιν· ἐνοχλεῖσθαι αὐτόν.
**15** Καὶ ἀποστέλλει τοῦ ἰδεῖν ἐπὶ τὸν Δαυίδ, λέγων· ἀγάγετε αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τῆς κλίνης πρὸς μὲ τοῦ θανατῶσαι αὐτόν.
**16** Καὶ ἔρχονται οἱ ἄγγελοι, καὶ ἰδοὺ τὰ κενοτάφια ἐπὶ τῆς κλίνης, καὶ ἧπαρ τῶν αἰγῶν πρὸς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ.
**17** Καὶ εἶπε Σαοὺλ τῇ Μελχόλ· ἱνατί οὕτω παρελογίσω με, καὶ ἐξαπέστειλας τὸν ἐχθρόν μου, καὶ διεσώθη; καὶ εἶπε Μελχὸλ τῷ Σαούλ· αὐτὸς εἶπε πρὸς μέ· ἐξαπόστειλόν με, εἰ δὲ μὴ , θανατώσω σε.
**18** Καὶ Δαυὶδ ἔφυγε καὶ ἐσώθη, καὶ παραγίνεται πρὸς Σαμουὴλ εἰς Ἁρμαθαίμ, καὶ ἀπαγγέλλει αὐτῷ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν αὐτῷ Σαούλ· καὶ ἐπορεύθη Δαυὶδ καὶ Σαμουήλ, καὶ ἐκάθισαν ἐν Ναυιὼθ ἐν Ῥαμᾶ.
**19** Καὶ ἀπηγγέλη τῷ Σαούλ, λέγοντες· ἰδοὺ (δὴ) Δαυὶδ ἐν Ναυιὼθ ἐν Ῥαμᾷ.
**20** Καὶ ἀπέστειλε Σαοὺλ ἀγγέλους λαβεῖν τὸν Δαυίδ, καὶ εἶδαν τὴν ἐκκλησίαν τῶν προφητῶν τῶν προφητευόντων, καὶ Σαμουὴλ εἰστήκει καθεστηκὼς ἐπ᾽ αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀγγέλους τοῦ Σαούλ· πνεῦμα Θεοῦ, καὶ προφητεύουσι καίγε αὐτοί.
**21** Καὶ ἀπηγγέλη τῷ Σαούλ, καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ἀγγέλους ἑτέρους, καὶ προεφήτευσαν καὶ αὐτοί· καὶ προσέθετο Σαοὺλ ἀποστεῖλαι ἀγγέλους τρίτους, καὶ προεφήτευσαν καὶ αὐτοί.
**22** Καὶ ἐθυμώθη ὀργῇ Σαούλ, καὶ ἐπορεύθη καὶ αὐτὸς εἰς Ἁρμαθαίμ, καὶ ἔρχεται ἕως τοῦ φρέατος τοῦ μεγάλου τοῦ ἐν Σοχω, καὶ ἠρώτησε καὶ

*Note on correction:* The phrase "μητε τοὺς ἀλλοφύλους" which appeared at the very beginning of the OCR'd text for this page has been removed. This phrase, immediately following the contextual "καὶ ἐπολέμητε τοὺς ἀλλοφύλους" from the previous page, was ungrammatical as a standalone continuation and textually improbable, suggesting an OCR artifact or printing error that rendered the text incoherent. This correction falls under the provision that allows changes when the text is "ungrammatical or textually improbable," ensuring a coherent and faithful rendering. The subsequent text starting "Καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτοὺς..." completes verse 8. The verse number 9 has been moved to its appropriate place before "Καὶ ἐγένετο πνεῦμα Κυρίου...".

**Chapter 19**

**8** And he smote them with a mighty blow, exceeding great, and they fled from before his face.
**9** And it came to pass that the Lord's evil spirit came upon Saul, as he abode in his house, even as he slept; and a spear was in his hand. And behold, David played [the lyre] with his hands.
**10** Then Saul sought to strike the spear through David and into the wall; but David drew back from the presence of Saul, and the spear smote the wall.
**11** And David withdrew, and was delivered. And it came to pass in that same night, that Saul sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him, that they might put him to death in the morning. And Michal, his wife, reported unto David, saying, "If thou save not thy life this night, then shalt thou be put to death on the morrow."
**12** So Michal let David down through the window; and he departed, and fled, and was delivered.
**13** And Michal took the idols, [even the teraphim], and laid them upon the bed; and she placed a liver of goats at his head, and covered them with a garment.
**14** And Saul sent messengers to seize David; and they said, "He is sick [and troubled]."
**15** Then Saul sent [messengers again] to see David, saying, "Bring him up upon the bed unto me, that I may put him to death."
**16** And when the messengers came, behold, the idols were upon the bed, and the liver of goats at his head.
**17** And Saul said unto Michal, "Wherefore hast thou thus deceived me, and sent away mine enemy, so that he is delivered?" And Michal answered Saul, "He said unto me, 'Send me away, or else I will slay thee!'"
**18** So David fled and was delivered, and he came to Samuel at Ramah; and he declared unto him all that Saul had done unto him. And David and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth, which is in Ramah.
**19** And it was told Saul by [messengers], saying, "Behold, David is in Naioth in Ramah."
**20** Then Saul sent messengers to seize David. And they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing appointed over them. And the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they themselves also prophesied.
**21** And when it was reported unto Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. And Saul sent again a third company of messengers, and they themselves also prophesied.
**22** Then Saul was greatly wroth in his anger; and he himself went to Ramah, and came as far as the great well that is in Socho. And he enquired, saying,
