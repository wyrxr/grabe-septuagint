**6** Ἐμβλέφαντες εἰς ἐμὲ θαυμάσατε, χεῖρα θέντες ἐπὶ σιαγόνη. Ἐάν τε γὰρ
**7** μνησθῶ, ἐσπούδακα· ἔχουσι δέ μου τὰς σάρκας ὀδύναι. Διατὶ (δὲ)
**8** ἀσεβεῖς ζῶσι, πεπαλαίωνται δὲ καὶ ἐν πλούτῳ; Ὁ σπόρος αὐτῶν
**9** κατὰ ψυχήν, τὰ δὲ τέκνα αὐτῶν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτῶν. Οἱ οἶκοι
    αὐτῶν εὐθηνοῦσι, φόβος δὲ οὐδαμοῦ· μάστιξ δὲ παρὰ Κυρίου οὐκ
**10** ἔστιν ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῖς. Ἡ βοῦς αὐτῶν οὐκ ὠμοτόκησε, διεσώθη δὲ αὐ-
**11** τῶν ἡ ἐν γαστρὶ ἔχουσα, καὶ οὐκ ἔσφαλε. Μένουσι δὲ ὥσπερ πρό-
**12** βατα αἰώνια· τὰ δὲ παιδία αὐτῶν προσπαίζει αὐτοῖς, ἀναλαμβά-
**13** νοντα ψαλτήριον καὶ κιθάραν, καὶ εὐφραίνονται φωνῇ ψαλμοῦ. Συν-
    ετέλεσαν ἐν ἀγαθοῖς τὸν βίον αὐτῶν, ἐν δὲ ἀναπαύσει ᾅδου ἔκοι-
**14** μήθησαν. Λέγει δὲ (ὁ ἀσεβὴς) τῷ Κυρίῳ· ἀπόστα ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ· τὰς
**15** ὁδούς σου εἰδέναι οὐ βούλομαι. Τί ἱκανὸς ὅτι δουλεύσωμεν αὐτῷ;
**16** καὶ τίς ὠφέλεια ὅτι ἀπαντήσωμεν αὐτῷ; Ἐν χερσὶ γὰρ αὐτῶν
**17** ἦν τὰ ἀγαθά, ἔργα δὲ ἀσεβῶν οὐ καθορᾷ. Οὐ μὴν δὲ ἀλλὰ καὶ
    ἀσεβῶν λύχνος σβεσθήσεται, ἐπελεύσεται δὲ αὐτοῖς ἡ καταστροφή,
**18** καὶ ὠδῖνες αὐτοὺς ἕξουσιν ἀπὸ ὀργῆς· ἔσονται δὲ ὥσπερ ἄχυρα
**19** πρὸ ἀνέμου, ἢ ὥσπερ κονιορτὸς ὃν ὀφείλατο λαῖλαψ. Ἐκλείποι·
**20** υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ τὰ ὑπάρχοντα αὐτοῦ· ἀνταποδώσει πρὸς αὐτὸν καὶ
**21** γνώσεται. Ἴδοιεν δὲ οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτοῦ τὴν ἑαυτοῦ σφαγήν, καὶ
**22** ὑπὸ Κυρίου μὴ διασωθείη. Ὅτι τί θέλημα αὐτοῦ ἐν οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ
**23** μετ᾿ αὐτόν; καὶ ἀριθμοὶ μηνῶν αὐτοῦ διηρέθησαν. Πότερον οὐχὶ
    ὁ Κύριός ἐστιν ὁ διδάσκων σύνεσιν καὶ ἐπιστήμην; αὐτὸς δὲ φόνους
**24** διακρινεῖ. Οὗτος ἀποθανεῖται ἐν κράτει ἁπλοσύνης αὐτοῦ, ὅλος δὲ
**25** εὐπαθῶν καὶ εὐθηνῶν· τὰ δὲ ἔγκατα αὐτοῦ πλήρη στέατος, ὁ δὲ
**26** μυελὸς αὐτοῦ διαχέεται· ὁ δέ γε τελευτᾷ ὑπὸ πικρίας ψυχῆς, οὐ
**27** φαγὼν ἀγαθὸν οὐδέν· ὁμοθυμαδὸν δὲ (οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ) ἐπὶ γῆς κοι-
**28** μήσονται, σαπρία δὲ αὐτοὺς ἐκάλυψεν (ἐπὶ γῆς). Ὥστε οἶδα ὑμᾶς,
**29** ὅτι τόλμη ἐπικεισθέ μοι, ὅτι ἐρεῖτε· ποῦ ἔστιν οἶκος ἄρχοντος; Καὶ
**30** ποῦ ἐστι σκέπη τῶν σκηνωμάτων τῶν ἀσεβῶν; Ἐρωτήσατε πα-
    ραπορευομένους ὁδόν, καὶ τὰ σημεῖα αὐτῶν οὐκ ἀπαλλοτριώσετε.
**31** Ὅτι εἰς ἡμέραν ἀπωλείας κουφίζεται ὁ πονηρός, (καὶ) εἰς ἡμέραν
**32** ὀργῆς αὐτοῦ ἀπαχθήσονται. Τίς ἀπαγγελεῖ ἐπὶ πρόσωπον αὐ-
    τοῦ τὴν ὁδὸν αὐτοῦ; καὶ ἃ αὐτὸς ἐποίησε, τίς ἀνταποδώσει αὐ-
**33** τῷ; Καὶ αὐτὸς εἰς τάφους ἀπηνέχθη, καὶ ἐπὶ σωρῷ ἠγρύπνησεν.
**34** Ἐγλυκάνθησαν αὐτῷ χάλικες χειμάρρου· καὶ ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ πᾶς
    ἄνθρωπος ἀπελεύσεται, καὶ ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ ἀναρίθμητοι. Πῶς

## CHAPTER XXI.

**6** Gaze upon me, and be astonished, laying a hand upon your jaw. For if
**7** I am mindful, I have hastened; but pains possess my flesh. Why (then)
**8** do the ungodly live, and are they grown old also in wealth? Their seed
**9** is [established] according to [their] soul; and their children [are] before their eyes. Their houses
    prosper, and fear is nowhere; and a scourge from the Lord is not
**10** upon them. Their cow hath not cast her calf prematurely; and their
**11** pregnant [one] hath been delivered, and hath not miscarried. They abide as perpetual
**12** sheep; and their children play with them, taking up
**13** a psaltery and a lyre, and they rejoice with the sound of a psalm. They have ended
    their life in prosperity, and in the rest of Hades they have slept.
**14** But (the ungodly man) saith unto the Lord, Depart from me; I desire not
**15** to know thy ways. What is [He that is] sufficient, that we should serve Him?
**16** And what profit, that we should meet Him? For in their hands
**17** were the good things, but He doth not behold the works of the ungodly. Yet indeed, also
    the lamp of the ungodly shall be extinguished; and destruction shall come upon them,
**18** and travail-pains shall seize them from wrath; and they shall be as chaff
**19** before the wind, or as dust which a whirlwind hath owed. May his possessions perish
**20** [for] his sons; He shall repay [it] unto him, and he shall know [it].
**21** May his own eyes behold his slaughter, and may he not be delivered by the Lord.
**22** For what [is] his desire in his house after him? And the number of his months hath been divided.
**23** Is it not the Lord Who teacheth understanding and knowledge? But He shall judge slaughters.
**24** This man shall die in the might of his simplicity, and wholly
**25** thriving and prospering; and his inward parts [are] full of fat, and his
**26** marrow floweth freely; but he himself dieth in bitterness of soul,
**27** having eaten no good thing. And with one accord (his sons) shall lie down upon the earth,
**28** and rottenness hath covered them (upon the earth). So then I know you,
**29** that boldness is laid upon me, because ye will say, Where is the house of the prince? And
**30** where is the covering of the tents of the ungodly? Ask those who pass
    by the way, and their signs ye shall not disown.
**31** For unto the day of destruction is the wicked made light, (and) unto the day
**32** of his wrath shall they be led away. Who shall declare his way to his
    face? And what he himself hath done, who shall repay
**33** him? And he himself was borne unto the graves, and he watched upon the mound.
**34** The pebbles of the torrent have been made sweet to him; and after him shall all
    men go, and before him [were] innumerable. How
