ΚΕΦ. ΛΒ΄. ΤΩΝ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ ΙΟΥΔΑ Β΄. 819
πόλιν· καὶ ἐλάλησεν ἐπὶ τὸν Θεὸν Ἱερουσαλήμ, ὡς καὶ ἐπὶ θεοὺς λαῶν 19
τῆς γῆς ἔργα χειρῶν ἀνθρώπων. Καὶ προσηύξατο Ἑζεκίας ὁ βα- 20
σιλεύς, καὶ Ἡσαΐας υἱὸς Ἀμὼς ὁ προφήτης περὶ τούτων, καὶ ἐ-
βόησαν εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν. Καὶ ἀπέστειλε Κύριος ἄγγελον, καὶ ἐξ- 21
έτριψε πάντα δυνατὸν πολεμιστὴν, καὶ ἄρχοντα, καὶ στρατηγὸν
ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ βασιλέως Ἀσσοὺρ· καὶ ἀπέστρεψε τὸ πρόσωπον
μετὰ αἰσχύνης εἰς τὴν γῆν ἑαυτοῦ, καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς οἶκον τοῦ Θεοῦ
ἑαυτοῦ· καὶ τῶν ἐξελθόντων ἐκ κοιλίας αὐτοῦ κατέβαλον αὐτὸν ἐν
ῥομφαίᾳ. Καὶ ἔσωσε Κύριος τὸν Ἑζεκίαν καὶ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας 22
Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐκ χειρὸς Σενναχηρεὶμ βασιλέως Ἀσσοὺρ καὶ ἐκ χει-
ρὸς πάντων, καὶ κατέπαυσεν αὐτοὺς κυκλόθεν. Καὶ πολλοὶ ἔφερον 23
δῶρα τῷ Κυρίῳ εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ, καὶ δόματα τῷ Ἑζεκία βασιλεῖ
Ἰούδα, καὶ ὑψώθη κατ᾿ ὀφθαλμοὺς πάντων τῶν ἐθνῶν καὶ μετὰ
ταῦτα. Ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις ἠῤῥώστησεν Ἑζεκίας ἕως θανά- 24
του, καὶ προσηύξατο πρὸς Κύριον, καὶ ἐπήκουσεν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ση-
μεῖον ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ. Καὶ οὐ κατὰ τὸ ἀνταπόδομα ὃ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ 25
ἀνταπέδωκεν Ἑζεκίας, ἀλλ᾿ ὑψώθη ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐγένετο
ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν ὀργὴ καὶ ἐπὶ Ἰούδαν καὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ ἐταπεινώθη 26
Ἑζεκίας ἀπὸ τοῦ ὕψους τῆς καρδίας ἑαυτοῦ αὐτὸς, καὶ οἱ κατοικοῦντες
Ἱερουσαλὴμ, καὶ οὐκ ἐπῆλθεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς ὀργὴ Κυρίου ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις
Ἑζεκίου. Καὶ ἐγένετο τῷ Ἑζεκία πλοῦτος καὶ 27
δόξα πολλὴ σφόδρα· καὶ θησαυροὺς ἐποίησεν ἑαυτῷ ἀργυρίου, καὶ
χρυσίου, καὶ τοῦ λίθου τοῦ τιμίου, καὶ εἰς τὰ ἀρώματα, καὶ ὁπλο-
θήκας, καὶ εἰς σκεύη ἐπιθυμητὰ, καὶ πόλεις εἰς τὰ γεννήματα σί- 28
του, καὶ ἐλαίου, καὶ οἴνου, καὶ κώμας φάτνας παντὸς κτήνους,
καὶ μάνδρας εἰς τὰ ποίμνια, καὶ πόλεις ἃς ᾠκοδόμησεν ἑαυτῷ, καὶ 29
ἀποσκευὴν προβάτων, καὶ βοῶν εἰς πλῆθος, ὅτι ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ Κύ-
ριος ἀποσκευὴν πολλὴν σφόδρα. Αὐτὸς Ἑζεκίας ἐνέφραξε τὴν ἔξο- 30
δον τοῦ ὕδατος γειῶν τὸ ἄνω, καὶ κατήθυνεν αὐτὰ κάτω πρὸς
λίβα τῆς πόλεως Δαυΐδ· καὶ εὐοδώθη Ἑζεκίας ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς ἔρ-
γοις ἑαυτοῦ. Καὶ οὕτως τοῖς πρεσβευταῖς τῶν ἀρχόντων ἀπὸ Βα- 31
βυλῶνος τοῖς ἀποσταλεῖσι πρὸς αὐτὸν, πυθέσθαι παρ᾿ αὐτοῦ τὸ
τέρας, ὃ ἐγένετο ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἐγκατέλιπεν αὐτὸν Κύριος τοῦ
πειράσαι αὐτὸν, εἰδέναι τὰ ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ· Καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ 32
τῶν λόγων Ἑζεκίου, καὶ τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ, ἰδοὺ γέγραπται ἐν τῇ
προφητείᾳ Ἡσαΐου υἱοῦ Ἀμὼς τοῦ προφήτου, καὶ ἐπὶ βιβλίου βασιλέων.

### Chapter 32

¹⁹...unto the city; and he spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the peoples of the earth, [which are but] the work of men's hands.

²⁰ And Hezekiah the king, and Isaiah the son of Amoz, the prophet, prayed for this [cause], and cried out unto Heaven.

²¹ Then the Lord sent an angel, who utterly destroyed every mighty man of valour, and the leader, and the captain in the camp of the king of Asshur. And he returned with shame of face unto his own land; and when he was come into the house of his god, they that came forth from his own loins did slay him there with the sword.

²² Thus the Lord saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib king of Asshur, and from the hand of all [their enemies besides]; and He gave them rest on every side.

²³ And many brought gifts unto the Lord to Jerusalem, and offerings unto Hezekiah, the king of Judah; and he was exalted in the sight of all the nations from that time forth.

²⁴ In those days Hezekiah fell sick unto death; and he prayed unto the Lord, and He heard him, and gave him a sign.

²⁵ But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore wrath came upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.

²⁶ Nevertheless, Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the Lord came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.

²⁷ And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour; and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for armouries, and for choice vessels,

²⁸ cities for store of grain, and wine, and oil; and villages with stalls for all manner of beasts,

²⁹ and sheepfolds for flocks; moreover, he built cities, and possessed much sheep and oxen: for God had given him substance exceeding much.

³⁰ This same Hezekiah also stopped the outlet of the upper waters, and brought them straight down to the west side of the City of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.

³¹ Howbeit, concerning the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that He might know all that was in his heart.

³² Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings.
