14 Σαμμά. Καὶ Δαυὶδ αὐτὸς ἔστιν ὁ νεώτερος, καὶ οἱ τρεῖς οἱ μείζονες
15 ἐπορεύθησαν ὀπίσω Σαούλ. Καὶ Δαυὶδ ἀπῆλθε, καὶ ἀνέστρεψεν
ἀπὸ τοῦ Σαούλ, ποιμαίνων τὰ πρόβατα τοῦ πατρὸς αὑτοῦ
16 ἐν Βηθλεέμ. Καὶ προῆγεν ὁ ἀλλόφυλος ὀρθρίζων, καὶ ἑσπερίζων, καὶ
17 ἐξηλώθη τεσσαράκοντα ἡμέρας. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰεσσαὶ πρὸς Δαυίδ, λαβὲ
δὴ τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς σου οἴφει τοῦ ἀλφίτου, καὶ δέκα ἄρτους τούτους,
18 καὶ διάδραμε εἰς τὴν παρεμβολήν, καὶ δὸς τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς σου.
19 Καὶ τὰς δέκα τρυφαλίδας τοῦ γάλατος τούτου εἰσοίσεις τῷ χιλιάρχῳ,
καὶ τοὺς ἀδελφούς σου ἐπισκέψῃ εἰς εἰρήνην, καὶ ὅσα ἂν
20 χρῄζωσι γνώσῃ. Καὶ Σαοὺλ αὐτὸς καὶ πᾶς ἀνὴρ Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τῇ
κοιλάδι τῆς δρυὸς πολεμοῦντες μετὰ τῶν ἀλλοφύλων.
21 Καὶ ὤρθρισε Δαυὶδ τοπρωΐ, καὶ ἀφῆκε τὰ πρόβατα φύλακι καὶ
ἔλαβεν, καὶ ἀπῆλθε καθὰ ἐνετείλατο αὐτῷ Ἰεσσαί· καὶ ἦλθεν εἰς
22 τὴν στρογγύλωσιν καὶ δύναμιν τὴν ἐκπορευομένην εἰς τὴν παράταξιν,
καὶ ἠλάλαξαν ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ. Καὶ παρετάξαντο Ἰσραὴλ
23 καὶ οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι παράταξιν ἐξενάντιας παρατάξεως. Καὶ ἀφῆκεν
Δαυὶδ τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ ἀφ᾽ ἑαυτοῦ ἐπὶ χεῖρα φύλακος, καὶ ἔδραμεν
εἰς τὴν παράταξιν, καὶ ἦλθε καὶ ἠρώτησε τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς
24 αὐτοῦ εἰς εἰρήνην. Καὶ αὐτοῦ λαλοῦντος μετ᾽ αὐτῶν, ἰδοὺ ἀνὴρ ὁ
μεσαῖος ἀνέβαινε, Γολιὰθ ὁ Φιλισταῖος ὄνομα αὐτῷ ἐκ Γὲθ, ἐκ
25 τῶν παρατάξεων τῶν ἀλλοφύλων, καὶ ἐλάλησε κατὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα
καὶ ἤκουσε Δαυίδ. Καὶ πᾶς ἀνὴρ Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τῷ ἰδεῖν αὐτοὺς
τὸν ἄνδρα, καὶ ἔφυγον ἐκ προσώπου αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν σφόδρα.
26 Καὶ εἶπεν ἀνὴρ Ἰσραήλ, εἰ ἑωράκατε τὸν ἄνδρα τὸν ἀναβαίνοντα
τοῦτον, ὅτι ὀνειδίσαι τὸν Ἰσραὴλ ἀνέβη; καὶ ἔσται ἀνὴρ ὃς ἂν
πατάξῃ αὐτόν, πλουτίσει αὐτὸν ὁ βασιλεὺς πλοῦτον μέγαν, καὶ
τὴν θυγατέρα αὐτοῦ δώσει αὐτῷ, καὶ τὸν οἶκον τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ
27 ποιήσει ἐλεύθερον ἐν τῷ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ εἶπε Δαυὶδ πρὸς ἄνδρας
τοὺς συνεστηκότας μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ, λέγων· ἦ ποιηθήσεται τῷ ἀνδρὶ ὃς
ἂν πατάξει τὸν ἀλλόφυλον ἐκεῖνον, καὶ ἀφελεῖ ὀνειδισμὸν ἀπὸ
Ἰσραήλ; ὅτι τίς ἀλλόφυλος ὁ ἀπερίτμητος αὐτὸς, ὅτι ὠνείδισε
28 παράταξιν Θεοῦ ζῶντος; Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ λαὸς κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα
τοῦτο, λέγων· οὕτω ποιηθήσεται τῷ ἀνδρὶ ὃς ἂν πατάξει αὐτόν.
Καὶ ἤκουσεν Ἐλιὰβ ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ ὁ μείζων ἐν τῷ λαλεῖν
αὐτὸν πρὸς τοὺς ἄνδρας, καὶ ὠργίσθη θυμῷ Ἐλιὰβ ἐν τῷ Δαυίδ,
29 καὶ εἶπε, ἵνατί τοῦτο κατέβης; καὶ ἐπὶ τίνα ἀφῆκας τὰ μικρὰ
πρόβατα ἐκεῖνα ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ; ἐγὼ οἶδα τὴν ὑπερηφανίαν σου, καὶ
τὴν κακίαν τῆς καρδίας σου, ὅτι ἕνεκεν τοῦ ἰδεῖν τὸν πόλεμον,
30 κατέβης. Καὶ εἶπε Δαυίδ, τί ἐποίησα νῦν; οὐχὶ ῥῆμά ἐστιν; Καὶ
ἐπέστρεψε παρ᾿ αὐτοῦ εἰς ἐναντίον ἑτέρου, καὶ εἶπε κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα
τοῦτο· καὶ ἀπεκρίθη αὐτῷ ὁ λαὸς κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦ πρώτου.
31 Καὶ ἠκούσθησαν οἱ λόγοι οὓς ἐλάλησε Δαυίδ, καὶ ἀνηγγέλθησαν
ὀπίσω Σαούλ. Καὶ παρέλαβεν αὐτόν:
32 Καὶ εἶπε Δαυίδ πρὸς Σαούλ, μὴ δὴ συμπεσέτω ἡ καρδία τοῦ
Κυρίου μου ἐπ᾿ αὐτόν· ὁ δοῦλός σου πορεύσεται καὶ πολεμήσει μετὰ
33 τοῦ ἀλλοφύλου τούτου. Καὶ εἶπε Σαούλ πρὸς Δαυίδ, οὐ μὴ δυνηθήσῃ
πορευθῆναι πρὸς τὸν ἀλλόφυλον τοῦ πολεμεῖν πρὸς αὐτόν, ὅτι
34 παιδίον εἶ σύ, καὶ αὐτὸς ἀνὴρ πολεμιστὴς ἐκ νεότητος αὐτοῦ. Καὶ
εἶπε Δαυίδ πρὸς Σαούλ, ποιμαίνων ἦν ὁ δοῦλός σου τῷ πατρὶ
αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ ποιμνίῳ· καὶ ὅταν ἤρχετο ὁ λέων, καὶ ἡ ἄρκτος,
35 καὶ ἐλάμβανε πρόβατον ἐκ τῆς ἀγέλης. Καὶ ἐξεπορευόμην ὀπίσω
αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπάταξα αὐτόν, καὶ ἐξέσπασα ἐκ τοῦ στόματος αὐτοῦ·
καὶ εἰ ἐπανίστατο ἐπ᾿ ἐμέ, καὶ ἐκράτησα τῆς φάρυγγος αὐτοῦ,
36 καὶ ἐπάταξα καὶ ἐθανάτωσα αὐτόν. Καὶ τὸν λέοντα καὶ τὴν ἄρκτον
ἔτυπτεν ὁ δοῦλός σου, καὶ ἔσται ὁ ἀλλόφυλος ὁ ἀπερίτμητος
ὡς ἐν τούτων· οὐχὶ πορεύσομαι καὶ πατάξω αὐτόν, καὶ ἀφελῶ ὄνειδος
σήμερον ἐξ Ἰσραήλ; διότι τίς ὁ ἀπερίτμητος οὗτος, ὃς ὠνείδισε
37 παράταξιν Θεοῦ ζῶντος; Καὶ εἶπε Δαβίδ, Κύριος ὃς ἐξειλάτο
με ἐκ χειρὸς τοῦ λέοντος καὶ ἐκ χειρὸς τῆς ἄρκτου, οὗτος ἐξελεῖταί
με ἐκ χειρὸς τοῦ ἀλλοφύλου τοῦ ἀπεριτμήτου τούτου· καὶ
εἶπε Σαούλ πρὸς Δαυίδ, πορεύου, καὶ Κύριος ἔσται μετὰ σοῦ.
38 Καὶ ἐνέδυσε Σαοὺλ τὸν μανδύαν αὐτοῦ, καὶ περικεφαλαίαν χαλκῆν
39 ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἔζωσε Δαυίδ θώρακα, καὶ περιεζώσατο.
Δαυὶδ τὴν ῥομφαίαν αὐτοῦ ἐπάνω τοῦ μανδύου αὐτοῦ·
καὶ ἐκοπίασε περιπατῆσαι ἅπαξ καὶ δίς· καὶ εἶπε Δαυίδ πρὸς
Σαούλ, οὐ μὴ δύνομαι ἐν τούτοις πορευθῆναι, ἔτι οὐ πεπείραμαι·
40 καὶ ἀφαιροῦσιν αὐτὰ ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἔλαβε τὴν βακτηρίαν αὐτοῦ
ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐξελέξατο ἑαυτῷ πέντε λίθους ἐκ τοῦ
χειμάῤῥου, καὶ ἔθετο αὐτὸς ἐν τῷ καδίῳ τῷ ποιμενικῷ· τῷ ὄντι
αὐτῷ εἰς συλλογήν, καὶ σφενδόνην αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ.
41 Καὶ προσῆλθε πρὸς τὸν ἄνδρα τὸν ἀλλόφυλον. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη ὁ
ἀλλόφυλος παρευόμενος. καὶ ἐγγίζων πρὸς Δαυίδ, καὶ

14 Now David, he was the youngest; and the three eldest had gone after Saul.
15 But David went away, and returned from Saul, tending his father's sheep in Bethlehem.
16 And the Philistine came forth daily in the morning and in the evening, and was made zealous for forty days.
17 And Jesse said unto David his son, "Take now for thy brethren an ephah of parched grain, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp, and give them unto thy brethren.
18 And these ten cheeses of milk shalt thou bring to the chiliarch, and shalt inquire of thy brethren, if they be in peace, and what things they may lack, shalt thou know."
19 Now Saul, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of the oak, fighting with the Philistines.
20 And David rose early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took up [the provisions], and went as Jesse his father had commanded him; and he came unto the circular formation, even the army that went forth to battle, and they shouted in the war.
21 And Israel and the Philistines had arrayed themselves, line against line.
22 And David left his baggage with a keeper, and ran to the battle line, and came and inquired of his brethren how they fared.
23 And as he spake with them, behold, the challenger came up, Goliath the Philistine by name, from Gath, out of the battle arrays of the Philistines; and he spake according to these same words which David heard.
24 And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from his presence, and were exceedingly afraid.
25 And a man of Israel said, "Have ye seen this man who cometh up? Verily, to defy Israel is he come up. And it shall be, that the man who smiteth him, the king shall enrich him with great riches, and shall give him his daughter, and shall make his father's house free in Israel."
26 And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, "What shall be done unto the man that smiteth this Philistine, and taketh away reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he hath defied the array of the Living God?"
27 And the people answered him according to this word, saying, "Thus shall it be done unto the man that smiteth him."
28 And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab's wrath was kindled against David, and he said, "Wherefore camest thou down hither? And upon what account hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the wickedness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle."
29 And David said, "What have I done now? Was it not but a word?"
30 And he turned from him unto another, and spake according to these same words; and the people answered him according to the word of the first [one].
31 And the words which David spake were heard, and they were told to Saul. And he took him [unto himself].
32 And David said unto Saul, "Let not the heart of my lord fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine."
33 And Saul said unto David, "Thou shalt not be able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth."
34 And David said unto Saul, "Thy servant was a shepherd to his father among the flock; and when there came a lion, or a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock—
35 —Then I went out after him, and smote him, and plucked [the prey] out of his mouth; and if he arose against me, I caught him by his throat, and smote him, and slew him.
36 Both the lion and the bear thy servant smote; and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them. Shall I not go and smite him, and take away the reproach this day from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised one, who hath defied the array of the Living God?"
37 And David said, "The LORD who delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, He shall deliver me out of the hand of this uncircumcised Philistine." And Saul said unto David, "Go, and the LORD be with thee."
38 And Saul clad David with his mantle, and placed a helmet of bronze upon his head.
39 And David girt on a breastplate, and girded his sword upon his mantle. And he essayed to walk once and twice; and David said unto Saul, "I cannot go forth with these, for I have not proven them." And they took them off him.
40 And he took his staff in his hand; and he chose for himself five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in his shepherd's bag, which was for gathering [stones]; and his sling was in his hand.
41 And he drew near unto the Philistine. And the Philistine went, advancing and drawing nigh unto David, and
