ΚΕΦ. ΙΕ´. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Β´. 573
τεσσαράκοντα ἐτῶν, καὶ εἶπεν Ἀβεσσαλὼμ πρὸς τὸν πατέρα
αὐτοῦ· πορεύσομαι δὴ, καὶ ἀποτίσω τὰς εὐχάς μου ἃς ηὐξά-
μην τῷ Κυρίῳ ἐν Χεβρὼν ὅτι εὐχὴν ηὔξατο ὁ δοῦλός σου ἐν τῷ 8
οἰκεῖν με ἐν Γεδσοὺρ ἐν Συρίᾳ, λέγων· ἐὰν ἐπιστρέφων ἐπιστρέ-
ψῃ με ὁ Κύριος εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ, καὶ λατρεύσω τῷ Κυρίῳ. Καὶ 9
εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ βασιλεύς· βάδιζε εἰς εἰρήνην. Καὶ ἀναστὰς ἐπο-
ρεύθη εἰς Χεβρών. Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ἀβεσσαλὼμ κατασκόπους ἐν 10
πάσαις φυλαῖς Ἰσραὴλ, λέγων· ἐν τῷ ἀκοῦσαι ὑμᾶς τὴν φωνὴν
τῆς κερατίνης, καὶ ἐρεῖτε· βεβασίλευκεν Ἀβεσσαλὼμ ἐν Χεβρών.
Καὶ μετὰ Ἀβεσσαλὼμ ἐπορεύθησαν διακόσιοι ἄνδρες ἐξ Ἱερουσα- 11
λὴμ κλητοί· καὶ πορευόμενοι ἐν τῇ ἁπλότητι αὐτῶν, καὶ οὐκ ἔ-
γνωσαν πᾶν ῥῆμα. Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ἀβεσσαλὼμ τῷ Ἀχιτόφελ, 12
τῷ Γιλωναίῳ, τῷ συμβούλῳ Δαυὶδ, ἐν πόλει αὐτοῦ, ἐν Γωλὰ,
ἐν τῷ θυσιάζειν αὐτὸν τὰς θυσίας· καὶ ἐγένετο σύστρεμμα ἰσχυ-
ρόν· καὶ ὁ λαὸς πορευόμενος καὶ πολὺς μετὰ Ἀβεσσαλώμ. Καὶ 13
παρεγένετο ἀπαγγέλλων πρὸς Δαυὶδ, λέγων· ἐγενήθη ἡ καρδία
ἀνδρῶν Ἰσραὴλ ὀπίσω Ἀβεσσαλώμ. Καὶ εἶπε Δαυὶδ πᾶσι τοῖς 14
παισὶν αὐτοῦ τοῖς μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, τοῖς ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ· ἀνάστητε,
καὶ φύγωμεν, ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν ἡμῖν σωτηρία ἀπὸ προσώπου Ἀβεσ-
σαγλώμ· (καὶ) ταχύνῃ τοῦ πορευθῆναι, ἵνα μὴ ταχύνῃ καὶ κατα-
λάβῃ ἡμᾶς, καὶ ἐξώσῃ ἐφ᾿ ἡμᾶς τὴν κακίαν, καὶ πατάξῃ τὴν πό-
λιν ἐν στόματι μαχαίρας. Καὶ εἶπαν οἱ παῖδες τοῦ βασιλέως 15
πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα· κατὰ πάντα ὅσα αἱρεῖται ὁ κύριος ἡμῶν ὁ
βασιλεὺς, ἰδοὺ οἱ παῖδές σου. Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ πᾶς 16
ὁ οἶκος αὐτοῦ τοῖς ποσὶν αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἀφῆκεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τὰς
δέκα γυναῖκας τῶν παλλακῶν αὐτοῦ φυλάσσειν τὸν οἶκον. Καὶ 17
ἐξῆλθεν ὁ βασιλεὺς, καὶ πάντες οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ πεζοὶ, καὶ ἔστη-
σαν ἐν οἴκῳ τῷ μακρᾷ. Καὶ πάντες οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ παρῆγον 18
ἀνὰ χεῖρα αὐτοῦ, καὶ πᾶς Χερεθθεὶ, καὶ πᾶς ὁ Φελεθθεὶ, καὶ
πάντες οἱ Γεθθαῖοι, ἑξακόσιοι ἄνδρες οἱ ἐλθόντες ἐν τοῖς ποσὶν αὐ-
τῶν ἐκ Γὲθ, καὶ πορευόμενοι ἐπὶ πρόσωπον τοῦ βασιλέως. Καὶ 19
εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς πρὸς Ἐθει τὸν Γεθθαῖον· ἵνατί πορεύῃ καὶ σὺ
μεθ᾿ ἡμῶν; ἐπίστρεφε, καὶ οἴκει μετὰ τοῦ βασιλέως, ὅτι ξένος εἶ
σὺ, καὶ ὅτι μετῴκηκας σὺ ἐκ τοῦ τόπου σου. Εἰ ἐχθὲς παραγέ- 20
γονας, καὶ σήμερον κινήσω σε μεθ᾿ ἡμῶν τοῦ πορευθῆναι; καὶ ἐγὼ
πορεύσομαι ἐφ᾿ οὗ ἂν ἐγὼ πορευθῶ. Ἐπιστρέφου, καὶ ἐπίστρεψον

**15:7** And it came to pass, after the end of forty years, that Absalom said unto his father, "I will go now, and pay my vows which I have vowed unto the Lord in Hebron.
**8** For thy servant vowed a vow whilst I abode in Geshur in Syria, saying, 'If the Lord shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then will I worship the Lord.'"
**9** And the king said unto him, "Go in peace." So he arose, and went to Hebron.
**10** And Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, "As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, 'Absalom reigns in Hebron.'"
**11** And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, [who were] called; and they went in their simplicity, and knew not any thing.
**12** And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city, [even] from Gola, whilst he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy became strong; and the people, going forth, were many with Absalom.
**13** And there came a messenger unto David, saying, "The hearts of the men of Israel are turned after Absalom."
**14** And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, "Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from the face of Abesagloom. (And) make haste to depart, lest he make haste and overtake us, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword."
**15** And the king's servants said unto the king, "Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever our lord the king shall choose."
**16** And the king went forth, and all his household on their feet. And the king left ten women [who were] his concubines, to keep the house.
**17** And the king went forth, and all his servants on foot, and stood in a house afar off.
**18** And all his servants passed by beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came on their feet from Gath, passed on before the king.
**19** Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, "Wherefore goest thou also with us? Return, and abide with the king; for thou art a stranger, and also an exile from thy own place.
**20** Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee wander with us? And I will go whither I myself must go. Return thou, and turn [thy men] back."
