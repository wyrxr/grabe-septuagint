**19** ἔα δὲ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας οἰκίας πηλίνας, ἐξ ὧν καὶ αὐτοί ἔσμεν ἐκ τοῦ αὐτοῦ πηλοῦ. Ἔπαισεν αὐτοὺς σητὸς τρόπον, ἀπὸ πρωΐθεν ἕως ἑσπέρας, καὶ οὐκέτι εἰσί·
**20** Καὶ παρὰ τὸ μὴ δύνασθαι αὐτοὺς ἑαυτοῖς βοηθῆσαι, ἀπώλοντο. Ἐνεφύσησε γὰρ αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἐτελεύτησαν,
**21** καὶ παρὰ τὸ μὴ ἔχειν αὐτοὺς σοφίαν, ἀπώλοντο.

**ΚΕΦ. Ε΄. V.**

**1** Ἐπικαλέσαι δὴ εἴ τις σου εἰσακούσεται, ἢ εἴ τινα ἁγίων ἀγγέλων ὄψῃ;
**2** Καὶ γὰρ ἄφρονα ἀναιρεῖ ὀργὴ, πεπλανημένον δὲ θανατοῖ ζῆλος.
**3** Ἐγὼ δὲ ἑώρακα ἄφρονας ῥίζαν βάλλοντας· ἀλλ᾿ εὐθὺς ἡ δίαιτα αὐτῶν ἐβρώθη·
**4** Πόῤῥω ἐγένοντο οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτῶν ἀπὸ σωτηρίας, κολαβρισθεῖσαν δὲ ἐπὶ θύραις ἡσσόνων, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ὁ ἐξαιρούμενος.
**5** Ἃ γὰρ ἐκεῖνοι συνήγαγον, δίκαιοι ἔδονται· αὐτοὶ δὲ ἐκ κακῶν οὐκ ἐξαιρεθήσονται, καὶ ἐκσιφωνισθείη αὐτῶν ἡ ἰσχύς.
**6** Οὐ γὰρ μὴ ἐξέλθῃ ἐκ γῆς κόπος, οὐδὲ ἐξ ὀρέων ἀναβλαστήσει πόνος·
**7** ἀλλὰ ἄνθρωπος ἐν κόπῳ γεννᾶται, νεοσσοὶ δὲ γυπῶν τὰ ὑψηλὰ πέτονται.
**8** Οὐ μὴν δὲ ἀλλ᾿ ἐγὼ δεηθήσομαι Κυρίου, Κύριον δὲ
**9** τὸν πάντων δεσπότην ἐπικαλέσομαι, τὸν ποιοῦντα μεγάλα καὶ
**10** ἀνεξιχνίαστα, ἔνδοξά τε καὶ ἐξαίσια, ὧν οὐκ ἔστιν ἀριθμός· τὸν διδόντα ὑετὸν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον τῆς γῆς, τὸν ἀποστέλλοντα ὕδωρ ἐπὶ
**11** τὴν ὑπ᾿ οὐρανόν· τὸν ποιοῦντα ταπεινοὺς εἰς ὕψος, καὶ ἀπολωλότας
**12** ἐξεγείροντα εἰς σωτηρίαν· τὸν διαλλάσσοντα βουλὰς πανούργων,
**13** καὶ οὐ μὴ ποιήσουσιν αἱ χεῖρες αὐτῶν ἀληθές· ὁ καταλαμβάνων σοφοὺς ἐν τῇ φρονήσει αὐτῶν, βουλὴν δὲ πολυπλόκων ἐξέστησεν.
**14** Ἐν ἡμέρᾳ αὐτοῖς συναντήσεται σκότος, τὸ δὲ μεσημβρινὸν ψηλαφήσειαν ἴσα νυκτί· ἀπόλοιντο δὲ ἐν πολέμῳ.
**15** Ἀδύνατος δὲ ἐξέλθοι ἐκ χειρὸς δυνάστου, καὶ εἴη ἀδυνάτῳ ἐλπίς·
**16** καὶ ἀδίκου στόμα ἐμφραχθείη.
**17** Μακάριος δὲ ἄνθρωπος ὃν ἤλεγξεν ὁ Κύριος (ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς)· νουθέτημα δὲ παντοκράτορος μὴ ἀπαναινοῦ.
**18** Αὐτὸς γὰρ ἀλγεῖν ποιεῖ, καὶ πάλιν ἀποκαθίστησιν· ἔπαισε, καὶ αἱ χεῖρες αὐτοῦ ἰάσονταί·
**19** ἑξάκις ἐξ ἀναγκῶν ἐξελεῖταί σε, ἐν δὲ τῷ ἑβδόμῳ οὐχ ἅψεταί σου κακόν.
**20** Ἐν λιμῷ ῥύσεταί σε ἐκ θανάτου· καὶ ἐν πολέμῳ ἐκ χειρὸς σιδήρου λύσει σε.
**21** Ἀπὸ μάστιγος γλώσσης κρύψει σε, καὶ οὐ φοβηθήσῃ ἀπὸ κακῶν ἐρχομένων· (καὶ οὐ φοβηθήσῃ ἀπὸ ταλαιπωρίας, ὅτι ἐλεύσεται ταλαιπωρία·)
**22** ἀδίκων καὶ ἀνόμων καταγελάσῃ, ἀπὸ δὲ θηρίων ἀγρίων τῆς γῆς οὐ φοβηθήσῃ·
**23** θήρες

## CHAPTER IV.

19 How much more them that dwell in houses of clay, of which even they themselves, we are of the same clay. He struck them after the manner of a moth; from morning until evening, and they are no more;
20 And because they were unable to help themselves, they perished. For He breathed upon them, and they died;
21 And because they had no wisdom, they perished.

## CHAPTER V.

1 Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; or if thou wilt behold any of the holy angels?
2 For anger slayeth the foolish man, and envy bringeth death to him that is led astray.
3 I myself have seen foolish men striking root; but straightway their habitation was consumed.
4 Far off were their children from salvation, and they were trodden down at the gates of the weaker, and there was none to deliver them.
5 For what they gathered, the righteous shall eat; but they themselves shall not be delivered from evils, and their strength shall be utterly drained away.
6 For toil cometh not forth from the earth, nor doth sorrow spring out of the mountains;
7 But man is born unto toil, even as the vultures' young fly high.
8 Nevertheless, I will supplicate the Lord; yea, the Lord,
9 The Master of all, will I invoke; Him who doeth great things and
10 Unsearchable, glorious and wondrous things, of which there is no number; who giveth rain upon the face of the earth, and sendeth water upon
11 The [lands] under heaven; who exalteth the humble to high estate, and raiseth up the lost
12 Unto salvation; who frustrateth the counsels of the crafty,
13 So that their hands shall not perform that which is true; who taketh the wise in their own cunning, and maketh the counsel of the devious to go awry.
14 In the daytime shall darkness meet them, and at midday they shall grope as in the night; and they shall perish in war.
15 But the helpless man shall escape from the hand of the mighty, and there shall be hope for the helpless;
16 And the mouth of the unjust shall be stopped.
17 Blessed is the man whom the Lord hath reproved (upon the earth); therefore reject thou not the instruction of the Almighty.
18 For He maketh to grieve, and again He restoreth; He hath smitten, and His hands shall heal.
19 Six times shall He deliver thee from distresses, and in the seventh, no evil shall touch thee.
20 In famine shall He redeem thee from death; and in war, from the hand of the sword, shall He deliver thee.
21 From the scourge of the tongue shall He hide thee, and thou shalt not fear from evils that come; (and thou shalt not fear from tribulation, for tribulation shall come;)
22 Thou shalt laugh at the unjust and the lawless, and from the wild beasts of the earth shalt thou not fear;
23 For the wild beasts...
