τῶν ἐξηλιασμένων. Καὶ ἔθαψε τὰ ὀστᾶ Σαούλ, καὶ τὰ ὀστᾶ 14
Ἰωνάθαν τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ τῶν ἡλιασθέντων ἐν τῇ γῇ Βενια-
μίν ἐν τῇ πλευρᾷ, ἐν τῷ τάφῳ Κίς τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ. Καὶ
ἐποίησαν πάντα ὅσα ἐνετείλατο ὁ βασιλεύς. Καὶ ἐπήκουσεν ὁ Θεὸς
τῇ γῇ μετὰ ταῦτα. Καὶ ἐγενήθη ἔτι πόλεμος τοῖς ἀλλοφύλοις 15
μετὰ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ κατέβη Δαυὶδ καὶ οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ,
καὶ ἐπολέμησαν μετὰ τῶν ἀλλοφύλων· καὶ ἐξελύθη Δαυίδ· καὶ Ἰ- 16
εσβὶ ἐν Νὸβ ὃς ἦν ἐν τοῖς ἐκγόνοις τοῦ Ῥαφᾶ, καὶ ὁ σταθμὸς
τοῦ δόρατος αὐτοῦ, τριακοσίων σίκλων ὁλκῆς χαλκοῦ· καὶ αὐτὸς
περιεζωσμένος κορύνην· καὶ διεννοεῖτο τοῦ πατάξαι τὸν Δαυίδ. Καὶ 17
ἐβοήθησεν αὐτῷ Ἀβισαεὶ υἱὸς Σαρουΐας, καὶ ἐπάταξε τὸν ἀλλόφυλον,
καὶ ἐθανάτωσεν αὐτόν. Τότε ὤμοσαν οἱ ἄνδρες Δαυίδ, λέγοντες·
οὐκ ἐξελεύσῃ ἔτι μεθ᾿ ἡμῶν εἰς πόλεμον, καὶ οὐ μὴ σβέσῃς τὸν
λύχνον Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἐγενήθη μετὰ ταῦτα ἔτι πόλεμος ἐν Γὲθ 18
μετὰ τῶν ἀλλοφύλων. τότε ἐπάταξε Σεβοχαεὶ ὁ Ἀουσαστωθεί τὸν
Σέφ τὸν ἐν τοῖς ἐγγόνοις τοῦ Ῥαφᾶ. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὁ πόλεμος ἐν 19
Γὲθ μετὰ τῶν ἀλλοφύλων. Καὶ ἐπάταξεν Ἐλεανὰν υἱὸς Ἀριωργείμ
ὁ Βηθλεεμίτης τὸν Γολιὰθ τὸν Γεθθαῖον. Καὶ τὸ ξύλον τοῦ
δόρατος αὐτοῦ ὡς ἀντίον ὑφαινόντων. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἔτι πόλεμος 20
ἐν Γέθ. Καὶ ἦν ἀνὴρ Μαδών, καὶ οἱ δάκτυλοι τῶν χειρῶν αὐ-
τοῦ, καὶ οἱ δάκτυλοι τῶν ποδῶν αὐτοῦ ἓξ καὶ ἓξ, εἰκοσιτέσσαρες
ἀριθμῷ· καὶ γε ὁ οὗτος ἐτέχθη τῷ Ῥαφᾷ. Καὶ ὠνείδισε τὸν 21
Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτὸν Ἰωνάθαν υἱὸς Σεμεεὶ ἀδελφοῦ Δαυίδ.
Οἱ τέσσαρες οὗτοι ἀπόγονοι τῶν γιγάντων τῷ Ῥαφᾷ ἐν Γὲθ, 22
καὶ ἔπεσαν ἐν χειρὶ Δαυίδ, καὶ ἐν χειρὶ τῶν δούλων αὐτοῦ.

**CHAPTER 21**

**14** ...of those who had been hanged. And he buried the bones of Saul, and the bones of Jonathan his son, and of them who had been hanged up in the land of Benjamin, in the side, in the tomb of Kish his father. And they performed all things whatsoever the king had commanded. And God hearkened unto the land after these things.

**15** And it came to pass, that there was yet again war with the Philistines against Israel. And David went down, and his servants with him, and they fought with the Philistines; and David grew faint.

**16** And Ishbi in Nob, who was among the descendants of Rapha—the weight of his spear was three hundred shekels of bronze, and he himself was girded with a club—he purposed to smite David.

**17** But Abishai the son of Zeruiah helped him, and smote the Philistine, and slew him. Then the men of David sware, saying, 'Thou shalt no more go out with us to battle, lest thou quench the lamp of Israel.'

**18** And it came to pass after this, that there was yet again war in Gath with the Philistines. Then Sibbechai the Hushathite smote Saph, who was among the descendants of Rapha.

**19** And the war was in Gath with the Philistines. And Elhanan the son of Ariorgeim the Bethlehemite smote Goliath the Gittite. And the shaft of his spear was like a weaver's beam.

**20** And there was yet again war in Gath. And there was a man, Madon, and the fingers of his hands, and the toes of his feet were six and six, twenty and four in number; and this one also was born unto Rapha.

**21** And he reproached Israel, and Jonathan the son of Shimei, David's brother, smote him.

**22** These four, the descendants of the giants of Rapha, were in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.

**CHAPTER 22**

**1** And David spake unto the Lord the words of this song, in the day that the Lord had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul.

**2** And he said, 'The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer unto me;

**3** my God shall be my protector, I will trust in Him. My shield, and the horn of my salvation, my helper, and my refuge, my salvation; from the unrighteous shalt Thou save me.

**4** The Praiseworthy will I call upon the Lord, and from mine enemies shall I be saved.

**5** For the pangs of death encompassed me,'
