ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Δ´. ΚΕΦ. ΙΑ´. ΙΒ´.
καὶ ἡ πόλις ἡσύχασεν· καὶ τὴν Γοθολίαν ἐθανάτωσαν ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ ἐν
21 οἴκῳ τοῦ βασιλέως. Υἱὸς ἑπτὰ ἐτῶν Ἰωὰς ἐν τῷ βασιλεύειν αὐτόν.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΒ´. ΧΙΙ.

1 ἘΝ ἔτει ἑβδόμῳ τοῦ Ἰηοῦ ἐβασίλευσεν Ἰωάς, καὶ τεσσαράκοντα
ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ὄνομα τῆς μητρὸς αὐτοῦ Ἀβιὰ
2 ἐκ τῆς Βηρσαβεέ. Καὶ ἐποίησεν Ἰωὰς τὸ εὐθὲς ἐνώπιον Κυρίου
3 πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας ἃς ἐφώτισεν αὐτὸν Ἰωαδαὲ ὁ ἱερεύς. Πλὴν
τῶν ὑψηλῶν οὐ μετεστάθησαν, καὶ ἐκεῖ ἔτι ὁ λαὸς ἐθυσίαζε, καὶ
4 ἐθυμίμων ἐν τοῖς ὑψηλοῖς. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰωὰς πρὸς τοὺς ἱερεῖς· πᾶν
τὸ ἀργύριον τῶν ἁγίων τὸ εἰσοδιαζόμενον ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου, ἀργύριον
παρερχομένου ἀνδρός, ψήφῳ ψυχῶν συντιμήσεως (ἀνήρ), πᾶν ἀρ-
γύριον ὃ ἐὰν ἀναβῇ ἐπὶ καρδίαν ἀνδρὸς ἐνεγκεῖν ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου,
5 λαβέτωσαν αὐτοῖς οἱ ἱερεῖς, ἀνὴρ ἀπὸ τῆς πράσεως αὐτοῦ, καὶ αὐ-
τοὶ κρατήσωσι τοῦ Βεδὲχ τοῦ οἴκου εἰς πάντα οὗ ἐὰν εὑρεθῇ ἐκεῖ
6 Βεδέκ. Καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐν τῷ εἰκοστῷ καὶ τρίτῳ ἔτει τῷ βασιλεῖ
7 Ἰωὰς οὐκ ἐκραταίωσαν οἱ ἱερεῖς τὸ Βεδὲχ τοῦ οἴκου. Καὶ ἐκά-
λεσεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἰωὰς Ἰωαδαὲ τὸν ἱερέα, καὶ τοὺς ἱερεῖς, καὶ
εἶπε πρὸς αὐτούς· τί ὅτι οὐκ ἐκραταιοῦτε τὸ Βεδὲχ τοῦ οἴκου;
καὶ νῦν μὴ λάβετε ἀργύριον ἀπὸ τῶν πράσεων ὑμῶν, ὅτι εἰς τὸ
8 Βεδὲχ τοῦ οἴκου δώσετε αὐτό. Καὶ συνεφώνησαν οἱ ἱερεῖς τοῦ μὴ
λαβεῖν ἀργύριον παρὰ τοῦ λαοῦ, καὶ τοῦ μὴ ἐνισχύσαι τὸ Βεδὲχ
9 τοῦ οἴκου. Καὶ ἔλαβεν Ἰωαδαὲ ὁ ἱερεὺς κιβωτὸν μίαν, καὶ ἔτρησε
τρώγλην ἐν τῇ σανίδι αὐτῆς, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὴν παρὰ Ἀμμασθί ἐν
τῷ οἴκῳ ἀνδρὸς οἴκου Κυρίου. Καὶ ἔδωκαν οἱ ἱερεῖς οἱ φυλάσ-
σοντες τὸν σταθμὸν πᾶν τὸ ἀργύριον τὸ εὑρεθὲν ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου
10 (Κυρίῳ). Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς εἶδον αὐτοί, ὅτι πολὺ τὸ ἀργύριον ἐν
τῇ κιβωτῷ, καὶ ἀνέβη ὁ γραμματεὺς τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ ὁ ἱερεὺς
ὁ μέγας, καὶ ἔσφιγξαν, καὶ ἠρίθμησαν τὸ ἀργύριον τὸ εὑρεθὲν ἐν
11 οἴκῳ Κυρίου. Καὶ ἔδωκαν τὸ ἀργύριον τὸ ἑτοιμασθὲν ἐπὶ χεῖρας
τῶν ποιούντων τὰ ἔργα τῶν ἐπισκόπων οἴκου Κυρίου· καὶ ἐξέδο-
σαν τοῖς τέκτοσι τῶν ξύλων, καὶ τοῖς οἰκοδόμοις τοῖς ποιοῦσιν ἐν
12 οἴκῳ Κυρίου, καὶ τοῖς τειχισταῖς, καὶ τοῖς τεχνίταις, καὶ τοῖς λα-
τόμοις τῶν λίθων τοῦ κτήσασθαι ξύλα, καὶ λίθους λατομητοὺς τοῦ
κατασχεῖν τὸ Βεδὲχ οἴκου Κυρίου, εἰς πάντα ὅσα ἐξωδιάσθη ἐπὶ
13 τὸν οἶκον τοῦ κραταιῶσαι. Πλὴν οὐ ποιήσεται οἴκῳ Κυρίου, θύ-

and the city was quieted. And Athaliah they put to death with the sword in the house of the king.

**21** Joash was seven years old when he began to reign.

### CHAPTER XII

**1** In the seventh year of Jehu did Joash begin to reign; and forty years did he reign in Jerusalem. And the name of his mother was Abiah of Beersheba.

**2** And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all the days wherein Jehoiada the priest enlightened him.

**3** Howbeit, the high places were not removed; and there did the people still sacrifice and burn incense upon the high places.

**4** And Joash said unto the priests, "All the silver of the hallowed things that is brought into the house of the LORD—the silver of each man as he passeth by, [even] the counting of souls for the valuation thereof (a man)—and all silver whatsoever it be that a man's heart may prompt him to bring into the house of the LORD—"

**5** "Let the priests take it for themselves, each man from his own portion; and let them themselves be responsible for the repair of the house concerning all things wherein a repair shall be found therein."

**6** And it came to pass, in the three and twentieth year of King Joash, that the priests had not strengthened the repair of the house.

**7** Then King Joash called for Jehoiada the priest, and for the other priests, and said unto them, "Wherefore have ye not strengthened the repair of the house? Now therefore, take ye no more silver from your portions, but ye shall give it for the repair of the house."

**8** And the priests agreed to receive no more silver from the people, nor to strengthen the repair of the house themselves.

**9** And Jehoiada the priest took one chest, and bored a hole in the lid thereof; and he placed it by Ammasthi, in the house of a man of the house of the LORD. And the priests who kept the guard gave all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD

**10** (unto the LORD). And it came to pass, when they saw that there was much silver in the chest, then came up the king's scribe and the high priest; and they bound up and counted the silver that was found in the house of the LORD.

**11** And they gave the silver that was weighed out into the hands of those who did the work, [even] the overseers of the house of the LORD. And they paid it out unto the carpenters of wood, and unto the builders who wrought in the house of the LORD,

**12** and unto the masons, and unto the craftsmen, and unto the stonecutters; for to buy timber and hewn stones, to carry out the repair of the house of the LORD, for all that was expended upon the house to strengthen it.

**13** Howbeit, there were not made for the house of the LORD, doors,
