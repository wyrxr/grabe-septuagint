ἀγρῶ. Ἐπ᾽ ἐρήμου ἐξελθόντες τῇ ἑαυτῶν πράξει, ἀγρὸν πρὸ ὥρας 6
οὐκ αὐτῶν ὄντα ἐθέρισαν. Ἡδύνθη δὲ αὐτῷ ἄρτος εἰς νεωτέρους·
ἀδύνατοι δὲ ἀσεβῶν ἀμπελῶνας ἀσιτὶ καὶ ἀμισθὶ εἰργάσαντο. Γυ- 7
μνοὺς δὲ πολλοὺς ἐκοίμισαν ἄνευ ἱματίων, ἀμφίασιν δὲ ψυχῆς
αὐτῶν ἀφείλαντο. Ἀπὸ ψεκάδων ὀρέων ὑγραίνονται, καὶ παρὰ τὸ 8
μὴ ἔχειν ἑαυτοὺς σκέπην, πέτραν περιεβάλοντο. Ἥρπασαν δὲ 9
ὀρφανὸν ἀπὸ μαστοῦ, καὶ ἐκπεπτωκότα ἐταπείνωσαν· γυμνοὺς ἐκοί- 10
μισαν ἀδίκως, πεινώντων δὲ ψωμῶν ἀφείλαντο. Ἐν στενοῖς ἐνη- 11
δρεύσαν ἀδίκως, ὁδὸν δὲ δικαίαν οὐκ ᾔδεισαν. Ἐκ πόλεως καὶ ἐξ 12
οἰκιῶν ἰδίων ἐξέβαλον αὐτούς· ψυχὴ δὲ νηπίων ἐστέναζε μεγάλως.
Αὐτὸς δὲ διατί τούτων ἐπισκοπὴν οὐ πεποίηται; Ἔτι ὄντων 13
αὐτῶν ἐπὶ γῆς, καὶ οὐκ ἐπέγνωσαν, ὁδὸν δὲ δικαιοσύνης οὐκ ᾔδει-
σαν, οὐδὲ ἐπορεύθησαν ἀτραποὺς αὐτῆς· γνοὺς δὲ αὐτῶν τὰ ἔργα, 14
παρέδωκεν αὐτοὺς εἰς σκότος, καὶ νυκτὸς ἔσται ὡς κλέπτης. Καὶ 15
ὀφθαλμὸς μοιχοῦ ἐφύλαξε σκότος, λέγων· οὐ προσνοήσει με ὁ ὀφ-
θαλμός· καὶ ἀποκρυβὴν προσώπου ἔθετο· διώρυξεν ἐν σκότει οἰ- 16
κίας, ἡμέρας δὲ ἐσφράγισαν ἑαυτούς, οὐκ ἐπέγνωσαν φῶς· ὅτι 17
ὁμοθυμαδὸν αὐτοῖς τὸ πρωὶ σκιὰ θανάτου, ὅτι ἐπιγνώσεται ταρα-
χὰς σκιᾶς θανάτου· ἐλαφρός ἐστιν ἐπὶ προσώπου ὕδατος. Κατα- 18
ραθείη ἡ μερὶς αὐτῶν ἐπὶ γῆς, ἀναφανείη δὲ τὰ φυτὰ αὐτῶν ἐπὶ
γῆς ξηρά. Ἀγκαλίδα γὰρ ὀρφανῶν ἥρπασαν. Εἶτα ἐμνήσθη αὐ- 19
τοῦ ἡ ἁμαρτία, καὶ ὥσπερ ὁμίχλη δρόσου, ἀφανὴς ἐγένετο· ἀπο- 20
δοθείη αὐτῷ καθὰ ἔπραξε, συντριβείη δὲ πᾶς ἄδικος ἴσα ξύλῳ ἀνιά-
τῳ. Σπεῖραν γὰρ οὐκ εὖ ἐποίησεν, οὐδὲ γύναιον ἠλέησε. Θυμῷ δὲ 21
κατέστρεψε δυνατούς. Ἀναστὰς τοιγαροῦν οὐ μὴ πιστεύσῃ ὑπὲρ 22
τῆς ἑαυτοῦ ζωῆς, μαλακισθεὶς δὲ μὴ ἐλπίζετω ὑγιαίναι, ἀλλὰ πε- 23
σεῖται νόσῳ· πολλοὺς γὰρ ἐκάκωσε τὸ ὕψωμα αὐτοῦ. Ἐμαράνθη 24
δὲ ὥσπερ μολόχῃ ἐν καύματι, ἢ ὥσπερ στάχυς αὐτόματος ἀπο-
πεσὼν ἀπὸ καλάμης. Εἰ δὲ μή, τίς ἐστιν ὁ φάμενός με ψευδῆ λέ- 25
γειν, καὶ θήσει εἰς οὐθὲν τὰ ῥήματά μου;

## CHAPTER XXIV.

**5** ...like wild asses in a field.
**6** Having gone forth into the wilderness by their own deed, they reaped a field that was not their own before its season. And bread was made sweet unto him [from what was taken] for the young; yet the helpless have wrought in the vineyards of the impious without food and without wage.
**7** And they have caused many naked ones to lie down without raiment; and they have stripped away the covering of their life.
**8** From the showers of the mountains are they drenched, and for not having a shelter for themselves, they clung unto the rock for refuge.
**9** Moreover, they have snatched the orphan from the breast, and have humbled him that hath fallen.
**10** They have caused the naked to sleep unjustly; and from the hungry have they taken away bread.
**11** In narrow straits they laid ambush unjustly; and the righteous way they knew not.
**12** From the city and from their own houses have they cast them out; and the soul of infants did groan greatly. But why hath He not made a visitation of these things?
**13** While yet they were upon the earth, they knew not, nor did they know the way of righteousness, neither did they walk in her paths;
**14** but knowing their works, He delivered them unto darkness; and by night he shall be as a thief.
**15** And the eye of the adulterer watched for darkness, saying, "No eye shall perceive me;" and he set a covering for his face.
**16** He hath dug through houses in darkness, and by day they have sealed themselves up; they have not known the light.
**17** For with one accord, the morning is to them the shadow of death, for he shall know the terrors of the shadow of death; he is [as] light upon the face of the waters.
**18** May their portion upon the earth be cursed, and may their plants appear dry upon the earth. For they have seized the sheaf of orphans.
**19** Then was his sin remembered, and like a mist of dew, he became invisible.
**20** May it be repaid unto him according as he hath acted, and may every unrighteous man be crushed even as incurable wood.
**21** For he hath not done well by the barren woman, nor hath he shown mercy to the woman.
**22** But in wrath he hath overthrown the mighty. Therefore, when he ariseth, he shall not trust for his own life; and being made faint, let him not hope to recover health;
**23** but he shall fall by disease; for his exaltation hath afflicted many.
**24** And he withered like mallow in the heat, or like an ear of grain falling of itself from the stalk.
**25** But if not, who is he that saith I speak falsely, and shall bring my words to nothing?

## CHAPTER XXV.

**1** Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said,
**2** What then? Is there a preface, or [is it] the fear with Him, who establisheth all things in the highest?
**3** Lest any man should suppose that there is a [delay] for pirates? Upon...
