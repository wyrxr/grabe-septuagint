632 ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Γʹ. ΚΕΦ. ΙΒʹ. ΙΓʹ.
28 βουὰμ βασιλέα Ἰούδα. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη ὁ βασιλεὺς, καὶ ἐποίησε δύο
   δαμάλεις χρυσᾶς, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς τὸν λαὸν, ἱκανοῦσθω ὑμῖν ἀνα-
   βαίνειν εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ· ἰδοὺ οἱ θεοί σου Ἰσραὴλ οἱ ἀνήγαγόν σε
29 ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου. Καὶ ἔθετο τὴν μίαν ἐν Βαιθὴλ, καὶ τὴν μίαν
30 ἔδωκεν ἐν Δάν. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὁ λόγος οὗτος εἰς ἁμαρτίαν· καὶ
   ἐπορεύετο ὁ λαὸς πρὸ προσώπου τῆς μιᾶς ἕως Δάν.
31 Καὶ ἐποίησεν οἴκους ἐπὶ ὑψηλῶν, καὶ ἐποίησεν ἱερεῖς μέρος τι ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ,
   οἳ οὐκ ἦσαν ἐκ τῶν υἱῶν Λευΐ.
32 Καὶ ἐποίησεν Ἱεροβοὰμ ἑορτὴν
   ἐν τῷ μηνὶ τῷ ὀγδόῳ ἐν τῇ πεντεκαιδεκάτῃ ἡμέρᾳ τοῦ μηνὸς
   κατὰ τὴν ἑορτὴν τὴν ἐν γῇ Ἰούδα, καὶ ἀνέβη ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστή-
   ριον ὃ ἐποίησεν ἐν Βαιθὴλ τοῦ θύειν ταῖς δαμάλεσιν αἷς ἐποίη-
   σε, καὶ παρέστησεν ἐν Βαιθὴλ τοὺς ἱερεῖς τῶν ὑψηλῶν ὧν ἐποίησε.
33 Καὶ ἀνέβη ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον ὃ ἐποίησεν ἐν Βαιθὴλ, τῇ πεντε-
   καιδεκάτῃ ἡμέρᾳ ἐν τῷ μηνὶ τῷ ὀγδόῳ, ἐν τῇ ἑορτῇ ᾗ ἐπλάσατο
   ἀπὸ καρδίας ἑαυτοῦ· καὶ ἐποίησεν ἑορτὴν τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ
   ἀνέβη ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον τοῦ ἐπιθῦσαι.

                  ΚΕΦ. ΙΓʹ. ΧΙΙΙ.

1 ΚΑΙ ἰδοὺ ἄνθρωπος τοῦ Θεοῦ παρεγένετο ἐξ Ἰούδα ἐν λόγῳ
  Κυρίου εἰς Βαιθὴλ, καὶ Ἱεροβοὰμ εἰστήκει ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον τοῦ
2 ἐπιθῦσαι. Καὶ ἐπεκάλεσε πρὸς τὸ θυσιαστήριον ἐν λόγῳ Κυρίου,
  καὶ εἶπε· Θυσιαστήριον, θυσιαστήριον, τάδε λέγει Κύριος· ἰδοὺ υἱὸς τίκτεται τῷ οἴκῳ Δαυΐδ, Ἰωσίας ὄνομα αὐτῷ, καὶ ἐπιθύσει
  ἐπὶ σὲ τοὺς ἱερεῖς τῶν ὑψηλῶν τῶν ἐπιθυόντων ἐπὶ σὲ, καὶ ὀσᾶ
  ἀνθρώπων καύσει ἐπὶ σε.
3 Καὶ ἔδωκεν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ τέρας, λέγων· τοῦτο τὸ τέρας ὃ ἐλάλησε Κύριος, λέγων· ἰδοὺ τὸ
  θυσιαστήριον ῥήγνυται, καὶ ἐκχυθήσεται ἡ πιότης ἡ ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ.
4 Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἤκουσεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἱεροβοὰμ τῶν λόγων τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ ἐπικαλεσαμένου ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον τὸ ἐν Βαιθὴλ, καὶ ἐξέτεινεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου, λέγων· συλλάβετε αὐτόν· καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐξηράνθη ἡ χεὶρ αὐτοῦ, ἣν ἐξέτεινεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν, καὶ οὐκ ἠδυνήθη ἐπιστρέψαι αὐτὴν πρὸς
  ἑαυτόν.
5 Καὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον ἐρράγη, καὶ ἐξεχύθη ἡ πιότης ἀπὸ
  τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου κατὰ τὸ τέρας ὃ ἔδωκεν ὁ ἄνθρωπος τοῦ Θεοῦ
  ἐν λόγῳ Κυρίου.
6 Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἱεροβοὰμ τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ

**28** ...boam, king of Judah. And the king departed, and fashioned two calves of gold, and he said unto the people, It is too much for you to go up unto Jerusalem; behold, these are thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
**29** And he set the one [calf] in Bethel, and the other he placed in Dan.
**30** And this thing became a sin; for the people went before the one [calf], even unto Dan.
**31** And he built houses upon the high places, and he made priests from amongst the people, who were not of the sons of Levi.
**32** And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, after the manner of the feast that was in the land of Judah; and he went up upon the altar which he had made in Bethel, to sacrifice unto the calves which he had made; and he set up in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had fashioned.
**33** And he went up upon the altar which he had made in Bethel, on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the feast which he had devised out of his own heart. And he ordained a feast for the sons of Israel, and went up upon the altar to offer incense.

### CHAPTER XIII

**1** AND behold, a man of God came from Judah by the word of the Lord unto Bethel; and Jeroboam stood by the altar to offer incense.
**2** And he cried against the altar by the word of the Lord, and said, O Altar, O Altar, thus saith the Lord: Behold, a son shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah shall be his name; and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and the bones of men shall he burn upon thee.
**3** And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which the Lord hath spoken: Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.
**4** And it came to pass, when King Jeroboam heard the words of the man of God, who had cried against the altar in Bethel, that the king stretched forth his hand from the altar, saying, Seize him! And behold, his hand, which he stretched forth against him, withered, so that he could not draw it back to himself.
**5** And the altar was rent, and the ashes were poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the Lord.
**6** Then King Jeroboam spake unto the man of God,
