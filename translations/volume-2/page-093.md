Ὅτι πάντα τὰ παιδία τοὺς υἱοὺς τοῦ βασιλέως ἐθανάτωσεν, ὅτι
Ἀμνὼν μονώτατος ἀπέθανεν, ὅτι ἐπὶ στόματος Ἀβεσσαλὼμ ἦν
κείμενος ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέρας ἧς ἐταπείνωσε Θαμὰρ τὴν ἀδελφὴν αὐ-
τοῦ. Καὶ νῦν μὴ θέσθω ὁ κύριός μου ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐπὶ τὴν καρ- 33
δίαν αὑτοῦ τὸ ῥῆμα, λέγων· πάντες οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ βασιλέως ἀπέ-
θανον· ὅτι Ἀμνὼν μονώτατος ἀπέθανε. Καὶ ἀπέδρα Ἀβεσσαλώμ. 34
Καὶ ἦρε τὸ παιδάριον ὁ σκοπὸς τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὑτοῦ, καὶ εἶδε·
Καὶ ἰδοὺ λαὸς πολὺς πορευόμενος ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ ὄπισθεν αὐτοῦ ἐκ
πλευροῦ τοῦ ὄρους ἐν τῇ καταβάσει. Καὶ παρεγένετο ὁ σκοπός, 35
καὶ ἀπήγγειλε τῷ βασιλεῖ, καὶ εἶπεν· ἄνδρας ἑώρακα ἐκ τῆς ὁδοῦ
τῶν ὀρέων ἐκ μέρους τοῦ ὄρους. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰωναδὰβ πρὸς
τὸν βασιλέα· ἰδοὺ οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ βασιλέως πάρεσι, κατὰ τὸν λό-
γον τοῦ δούλου σου, οὕτως ἐγένετο. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἡνίκα συνετελέσε 36
λαλῶν, καὶ ἰδοὺ οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ βασιλέως ἦλθον, καὶ ἐπῆραν τὴν φω-
νὴν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔκλαυσαν· καί γε ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ πάντες οἱ παῖ-
δες αὑτοῦ ἔκλαυσαν κλαυθμὸν μέγαν σφόδρα. Καὶ Ἀβεσσαλὼμ 37
ἔφυγε, καὶ ἐπορεύθη πρὸς Θολομαί, υἱὸν Ἐμιοὺδ, βασιλέα Γεδ-
σοὺρ, εἰς γῆν Μαχάδ. Καὶ ἐπένθησε Δαυὶδ ἐπὶ τὸν υἱὸν αὑτοῦ
πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας. Καὶ ἀπέδρα Ἀβεσσαλὼμ, καὶ ἐπορεύθη εἰς 38
Γεδοὺρ, καὶ ἦν ἐκεῖ ἔτη τρία. Καὶ ἐκόπασε Δαυὶδ ὁ βασιλεὺς 39
τοῦ ἐξελθεῖν πρὸς Ἀβεσσαλὼμ, ὅτι παρεκλήθη ἐπὶ Ἀμνὼν, ὅτι
ἀπέθανε.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΔ´. XIV.

ΚΑΙ ἔγνω Ἰωὰβ υἱὸς Σαρουίας ὅτι ἡ καρδία τοῦ βασιλέως 1
ἐπὶ Ἀβεσσαλώμ. Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ἰωὰβ εἰς Θεκωὲ, καὶ ἔλαβεν 2
ἐκεῖθεν γυναῖκα σοφὴν, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτήν· πένθησον δὴ, καὶ
ἔνδυσαι ἱμάτια πενθικὰ, καὶ μὴ ἀλείψῃς ἔλαιον, καὶ ἔσῃ ὡς γυνὴ
τοῦτο ἡμέρας πολλὰς πενθοῦσα ἐπὶ τεθνηκότι, καὶ ἐλεύσῃ πρὸς 3
τὸν βασιλέα, καὶ λαλήσεις πρὸς αὐτὸν κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο.
Καὶ ἔθηκεν Ἰωὰβ τοὺς λόγους εἰς τὸ στόμα αὐτῆς. Καὶ εἰσῆλθεν 4
ἡ γυνὴ ἡ Θεκωῖτις πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα, καὶ ἔπεσεν ἐπὶ πρό-
σωπον αὐτῆς ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, καὶ προσεκύνησεν αὐτῷ, καὶ εἶπε· σῶ-
σον, βασιλεῦ, σῶσον. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτὴν ὁ βασιλεὺς· τί ἔχει 5
σοι; ἡ δὲ εἶπε· καὶ μάλα γυνὴ χήρα ἐγὼ εἰμι, καὶ ἀπέθανεν ὁ

### Chapter 13

**32** "Let not my lord the king say that Absalom hath slain all the king's sons; for Amnon alone is dead. For this [matter] was determined in Absalom's mind from the day that he humbled Tamar his sister.
**33** Now therefore, let not my lord the king lay this word upon his heart, saying, 'All the king's sons are dead;' for Amnon alone is dead."

**34** And Absalom fled. And the young man, the watchman, lifted up his eyes and looked; and behold, many people were coming by the way behind him, from the side of the mountain, by the descending path.
**35** And the watchman came near and reported unto the king, and said, "I have seen men from the way of the mountains, from a part of the mountain." And Jonadab said unto the king, "Behold, the king's sons are come; according to the word of thy servant, so it is come to pass."
**36** And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, behold, the king's sons came, and they lifted up their voice, and wept; and even the king and all his servants wept with a great and exceeding bitter lamentation.
**37** And Absalom fled, and went unto Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur, into the land of Maachah. And David mourned for his son all the days.
**38** And Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.
**39** And the soul of King David longed to go forth unto Absalom; for he was comforted concerning Amnon, because he was dead.

### Chapter 14

**1** Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the heart of the king was toward Absalom.
**2** And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, "Feign mourning now, and put on mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, and be thou as a woman [in this state], mourning many days for the dead.
**3** And come thou unto the king, and speak unto him according to this word." And Joab put the words in her mouth.
**4** And the woman of Tekoah came in unto the king, and fell on her face to the ground, and bowed herself [before him], and said, "Help, O King, help!"
**5** And the king said unto her, "What aileth thee?" And she said, "Verily, I am a widow woman, and my husband is dead."
