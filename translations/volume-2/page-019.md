Καὶ τοὺς δούλους ὑμῶν καὶ τὰς δούλας ὑμῶν καὶ τὰ βουκέλια ὑμῶν τὰ ἀγαθὰ καὶ τοὺς ὄνους ὑμῶν λήψεται, καὶ ἀποδεκατώσει εἰς τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ· καὶ 17
τὰ ποίμνια ὑμῶν ἀποδεκατώσει, καὶ ὑμεῖς ἔσεσθε αὐτῷ δοῦλοι.
Καὶ βοήσεσθε ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἐκ προσώπου βασιλέως ὑμῶν 18
οὗ ἐξελέξασθε ἑαυτοῖς, καὶ οὐκ ἐπακούσεται Κύριος ὑμῶν ἐν ταῖς
ἡμέραις ἐκείναις, ὅτι ὑμεῖς ἐξελέξασθε ἑαυτοῖς βασιλέα. Καὶ οὐκ 19
ἐβούλετο ὁ λαὸς τοῦ ἀκοῦσαι τοῦ Σαμουήλ, καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῷ· οὐχ
ἀλλ᾿ ἢ ὅτι βασιλεὺς ἔσται ἐφ᾿ ἡμᾶς, καὶ ἐσόμεθα καὶ ἡμεῖς κα- 20
τὰ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη· καὶ δικάσει ἡμᾶς βασιλεὺς ἡμῶν, καὶ ἐξε-
λεύσεται ἔμπροσθεν ἡμῶν, καὶ πολεμήσει τὸν πόλεμον ἡμῶν. Καὶ 21
ἤκουσε Σαμουὴλ πάντας τοὺς λόγους τοῦ λαοῦ, καὶ ἐλάλησεν αὐ-
τοὺς εἰς τὰ ὦτα Κυρίου. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Σαμουήλ· ἄκουε 22
τῆς φωνῆς αὐτῶν, καὶ βασίλευον αὐτοῖς βασιλέα. Καὶ εἶπε Σα-
μουὴλ πρὸς ἄνδρας Ἰσραήλ· ἀποτρεχέτω ἕκαστος εἰς τὴν πό-
λιν αὐτοῦ.

ΚΑΙ ἦν ἀνὴρ ἐξ υἱῶν Βενιαμείν, καὶ ὄνομα αὐτῷ Κεῖς, υἱ- 1
ὸς Ἀβιήλ, υἱοῦ Ἀρέδ, υἱοῦ Βεχωράθ, υἱοῦ Ἀφίχ, υἱοῦ ἀνδρὸς
Ἰεμινναίου, ἀνὴρ δυνατὸς ἰσχύϊ. Καὶ τούτῳ υἱός, καὶ ὄνομα αὐ- 2
τῷ Σαούλ· εὐμεγέθης, ἀνὴρ ἀγαθός, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἐν υἱοῖς Ἰσρα-
ὴλ ἀγαθὸς ὑπὲρ αὐτόν, ὑπερωμίαν καὶ ἐπάνω ὑψηλὸς ὑπὲρ πᾶ-
σαν τὴν γῆν. Καὶ ἀπώλοντο αἱ ὄνοι Κεῖς τοῦ πατρὸς Σαούλ· 3
καὶ εἶπε Κεῖς πρὸς Σαοὺλ τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ· λάβε μετὰ σεαυτοῦ ἓν τῶν
παιδαρίων, καὶ ἀνάστητε, καὶ πορεύθητε, καὶ ζητήσατε τὰς ὄνους.
Καὶ διῆλθαν δι᾽ ὄρους Ἐφραΐμ, καὶ διῆλθον διὰ τῆς γῆς Σαλισ- 4
σά, καὶ οὐχ εὗρον· καὶ διῆλθον διὰ τῆς γῆς Σααλείμ, καὶ οὐκ ἦν· καὶ
διῆλθον διὰ τῆς γῆς τοῦ Ἰεμειναίου, καὶ οὐχ εὗρον. Αὐτῶν 5.
δὲ ἐλθόντων εἰς γῆν Σείφ, καὶ Σαοὺλ εἶπε τῷ παιδαρίῳ αὐτοῦ
τῷ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ· δεῦρο καὶ ἀποστρέψωμεν, μὴ ἀνείς ὁ πατήρ μου
τὰς ὄνους, φροντίζῃ περὶ ἡμῶν. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ τὸ παιδάριον· 6
ἰδοὺ δὴ ἄνθρωπος τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐν τῇ πόλει ταύτῃ, καὶ ὁ ἄνθρωπος
ἔνδοξος· πᾶν δ᾽ ἐὰν λαλήσῃ, παραγινόμενον παρέσται· καὶ νῦν
πορευθῶμεν ἐκεῖ, ὅπως ἀπαγγελῇ ἡμῖν τὴν ὁδὸν ἡμῶν, ἐφ᾿ ἣν
ἐπορεύθημεν ἐπ᾽ αὐτήν. Καὶ εἶπε Σαοὺλ τῷ παιδαρίῳ αὐτοῦ τῷ 7.

**Chapter 8**

16
And your male servants, and your female servants, and your best oxen, and your donkeys, he shall take, and shall decimate them for his own works.
17
Yea, and your flocks shall he decimate, and ye yourselves shall be his slaves.
18
And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king whom ye have chosen for yourselves; yet the Lord your God shall not hearken unto you in those days, because ye yourselves have chosen for yourselves a king.
19
But the people would not hearken unto the voice of Samuel; and they said unto him, "Nay,
20
but rather, a king shall be over us, and we also shall be like all the other nations; and our king shall judge us, and he shall go forth
21
before us, and shall fight our battles." And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he spoke them into the ears of the Lord.
22
And the Lord said unto Samuel, "Hearken unto their voice, and make a king over them." And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, "Let every man depart unto his own city."

**Chapter 9**

1
Now there was a man of the sons of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Ared, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphich, the son of a Jeminite man, a man mighty in strength.
2
And he had a son, whose name was Saul; a goodly man of great stature, and there was not among the sons of Israel a goodlier man than he; higher by a shoulder and above, [towering] over all the land.
3
Now the donkeys of Kish, Saul's father, were lost. And Kish said unto Saul his son, "Take now with thee one of the servants, and arise, and go, and seek the donkeys."
4
And they passed through the Mount Ephraim, and they passed through the land of Salissa, but they found [them] not. And they passed through the land of Shaalim, but there were none [to be found]. And they passed through the land of the Jeminite, but they found [them] not.
5
But when they were come into the land of Zuph, then Saul said unto his servant that was with him, "Come, let us return, lest my father cease to trouble for the donkeys, and become anxious for us."
6
And the servant answered him, "Behold now, a man of God is in this city, and the man is honorable; whatsoever he shall speak, it shall surely come to pass. Now therefore, let us go thither, that he may declare unto us the way wherein we went."
