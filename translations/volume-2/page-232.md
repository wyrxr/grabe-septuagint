ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Δ. ΚΕΦ. ΚΓʹ.
τοὺς Χωμαρεὶμ οὓς ἔδωκαν βασιλεῖς Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐθύμιων ἐν τοῖς
ὑψηλοῖς, καὶ ἐν ταῖς πόλεσιν Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐν τοῖς περικύκλῳ Ἱε-
ρουσαλήμ, καὶ τοὺς θυμιῶντας τῇ Βάαλ, καὶ τῷ ἡλίῳ, καὶ τῇ
σελήνῃ, καὶ τοῖς Μαζουρώθ, καὶ πάσῃ τῇ δυνάμει τοῦ οὐρανοῦ.
6 Καὶ ἐξήνεγκε τὸ ἄλσος ἐξ οἴκου Κυρίου ἔξωθεν Ἱερουσαλήμ,
εἰς τὸν χειμάῤῥουν Κέδρων, καὶ κατέκαυσεν αὐτὸν ἐν τῷ χει-
μάῤῥῳ Κέδρων, καὶ ἐλέπτυνεν εἰς χοῦν· καὶ ἔῤῥιψε τὸν χοῦν αὐ-
τοῦ εἰς τὸν τάφον τῶν υἱῶν τοῦ λαοῦ. Καὶ καθεῖλε τὸν οἶκον
7 τοῦ εἰς τὸν τάφον τῶν υἱῶν τοῦ λαοῦ. Καὶ καθεῖλε τὸν οἶκον
τῶν Καδησὶμ τῶν ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ Κυρίου, οὗ αἱ γυναῖκες ὕφαινον
8 ἔχει Χεττειὶμ τῷ ἄλσει. Καὶ ἀνήγαγε πάντας τοὺς ἱερεῖς ἐκ
πόλεων Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐμίανε τὰ ὑψηλὰ οὗ ἐθυμίασαν ἐκεῖ οἱ ἱερεῖς
ἀπὸ Γαβαά, καὶ ἕως Βηρσαβεέ· καὶ καθεῖλε τὸν οἶκον τῶν πυ-
λῶν, τῶν παρὰ τὴν θύραν τῆς πύλης Ἰησοῦ ἄρχοντος τῆς
πόλεως, τῶν ἐξ ἀριστερῶν ἀνδρὸς ἐν τῇ πύλῃ τῆς πόλεως.
9 Πλὴν οὐκ ἀνέβησαν οἱ ἱερεῖς τῶν ὑψηλῶν πρὸς τὸ θυσιαστήριον
Κυρίου ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, ὅτι εἰ μὴ ἔφαγον ἄζυμα ἐν μέσῳ τῶν
10 ἀδελφῶν αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐμίανε τὸν Θούφεθ τὸν ἐν φάραγγι υἱοῦ
Ἐννόμ, τοῦ διάγειν ἄνδρα τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἄνδρα τὴν θυ-
11 γατέρα αὐτοῦ τῷ Μολὼχ ἐν πυρί. Καὶ κατέπαυσε τοὺς ἵππους
οὓς ἔδωκαν βασιλεῖς Ἰούδα τῷ ἡλίῳ, ἐν τῇ εἰσόδῳ οἴκου Κυρίου
εἰς τὸ γαζοφυλάκιον Νάθαν βασιλέως τοῦ εὐνούχου, ὃς ἐν Φα-
12 ρουρείμ. Καὶ τὸ ἅρμα τοῦ ἡλίου κατέκαυσεν πυρί, καὶ τὰ θυ-
σιαστήρια τὰ ἐπὶ τοῦ δώματος τοῦ ὑπερώου Ἄχαζ, ἃ ἐποίησαν
βασιλεῖς Ἰούδα· καὶ τὰ θυσιαστήρια ἃ ἐποίησε Μανασσῆς ἐν
ταῖς δυσὶν αὐλαῖς οἴκου Κυρίου (καὶ) καθεῖλεν ὁ βασιλεύς, καὶ
κατέσπασεν ἐκεῖθεν, καὶ ἔῤῥιψε τὸν χοῦν αὐτῶν εἰς τὸν χειμάῤῥ-
13 ρουν Κέδρων. Καὶ τὸν οἶκον τὸν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον Ἱερουσαλήμ, τὸν
ἐκ δεξιῶν τοῦ ὄρους τοῦ Μοσθάθ, ὃν ᾠκοδόμησε Σαλωμὼν βα-
σιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ τῇ Ἀστάρτῃ προσοχθίσματι Σιδωνίων, καὶ τῷ
Χαμὼς προσοχθίσματι Μωάβ, καὶ τῷ Μελχὸμ βδελύγματι υἱῶν
14 Ἀμμών, ἐμίανεν ὁ βασιλεύς. Καὶ συνέτριψε τὰς στήλας, καὶ
ἐξωλέθρευσε τὰ ἄλση, καὶ ἔπλησε τοὺς τόπους αὐτῶν ὀστέων
15 ἀνθρώπων. Καί γε τὸ θυσιαστήριον τὸ ἐν Βαιθὴλ τὸ ὑψηλόν, ὃ
ἐποίησεν Ἱεροβοὰμ υἱὸς Ναβάτ, ὃς ἐξήμαρτε τὸν Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ
γε τὸ θυσιαστήριον ἐκεῖνο, καὶ τὸ ὑψηλὸν κατέσπασε, καὶ συνέ-
τριψε τοὺς λίθους αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐλέπτυνεν εἰς χοῦν, καὶ κατέκαυσε

**5** ...he put down the Komarim, whom the kings of Judah had appointed, and who burned incense in the high places, and in the cities of Judah, and in the environs of Jerusalem; yea, and them that burned incense unto Baal, and to the sun, and to the moon, and to the Mazzaroth, and to all the host of heaven.
**6** And he brought forth the Asherah from the house of the Lord, without Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and he burned it in the brook Kidron, and beat it to powder; and he cast the dust thereof upon the graves of the sons of the people.
**7** And he pulled down the house of the [one] unto the grave of the sons of the people. And he pulled down the house of the Qadeshim, who were in the house of the Lord, where the women did weave; [and he hath] Chetteeim for the Asherah.
**8** And he brought forth all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba even unto Beersheba. And he pulled down the house of the gates, which stood by the door of the gate of Joshua, the governor of the city, which were on a man's left hand at the gate of the city.

**13** And the house that was before Jerusalem, on the right hand of the Mount of Mosthath, which Solomon, king of Israel, had built for Astarte, the abomination of the Sidonians, and for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, and for Milcom, the abomination of the sons of Ammon, the king defiled.
**14** And he broke in pieces the pillars, and utterly destroyed the Asherahs, and filled their places with the bones of men.
**15** And moreover, the altar that was in Bethel, and the high place, which Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made; yea, and that altar, and the high place, he tore down, and broke in pieces the stones thereof, and beat them to powder, and burned...
