KEΦ. ΙΖʹ. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Αʹ. 515
29 ἐπὶ τίνα ἀφῆκας τὰ μικρὰ πρόβατα ἐκεῖνα ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ; ἐγὼ οἶδα τὴν
ὑπερηφανίαν σου, καὶ τὴν κακίαν τῆς καρδίας σου, ὅτι ἕνεκεν τοῦ
ἰδεῖν τὸν πόλεμον, κατέβης. Καὶ εἶπε Δαυίδ, τί ἐποίησα νῦν;
οὐχὶ ῥῆμά ἐστιν; 30 Καὶ ἐπέστρεψε παρ᾿ αὐτοῦ εἰς ἐναντίον ἑτέρου,
καὶ εἶπε κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο· καὶ ἀπεκρίθη αὐτῷ ὁ λαὸς κατὰ
τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦ πρώτου. 31 Καὶ ἠκούσθησαν οἱ λόγοι οὓς ἐλάλησε Δα-
υίδ, καὶ ἀνηγγέλθησαν ὀπίσω Σαούλ. Καὶ παρέλαβεν αὐτόν: 32 Καὶ
εἶπε Δαυίδ πρὸς Σαούλ, μὴ δὴ συμπεσέτω ἡ καρδία τοῦ Κυρίου
μου ἐπ᾿ αὐτόν· ὁ δοῦλός σου πορεύσεται καὶ πολεμήσει μετὰ τοῦ
ἀλλοφύλου τούτου. 33 Καὶ εἶπε Σαούλ πρὸς Δαυίδ, οὐ μὴ δυνηθήσῃ
πορευθῆναι πρὸς τὸν ἀλλόφυλον τοῦ πολεμεῖν πρὸς αὐτόν, ὅτι παι-
δίον εἶ σύ, καὶ αὐτὸς ἀνὴρ πολεμιστὴς ἐκ νεότητος αὐτοῦ. 34 Καὶ
εἶπε Δαυίδ πρὸς Σαούλ, ποιμαίνων ἦν ὁ δοῦλός σου τῷ πατρὶ
αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ ποιμνίῳ· καὶ ὅταν ἤρχετο ὁ λέων, καὶ ἡ ἄρκτος,
καὶ ἐλάμβανε πρόβατον ἐκ τῆς ἀγέλης. 35 Καὶ ἐξεπορευόμην ὀπί-
σω αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπάταξα αὐτόν, καὶ ἐξέσπασα ἐκ τοῦ στόματος
αὐτοῦ· καὶ εἰ ἐπανίστατο ἐπ᾿ ἐμέ, καὶ ἐκράτησα τῆς φάρυγγος
αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπάταξα καὶ ἐθανάτωσα αὐτόν. 36 Καὶ τὸν λέοντα καὶ
τὴν ἄρκτον ἔτυπτεν ὁ δοῦλός σου, καὶ ἔσται ὁ ἀλλόφυλος ὁ ἀπε-
ρίτμητος ὡς ἐν τούτων· οὐχὶ πορεύσομαι καὶ πατάξω αὐτόν, καὶ
ἀφελῶ ὄνειδος σήμερον ἐξ Ἰσραήλ; διότι τίς ὁ ἀπερίτμητος οὗ-
τος, ὃς ὠνείδισε παράταξιν Θεοῦ ζῶντος; 37 Καὶ εἶπε Δαβίδ, Κύ-
ριος ὃς ἐξειλάτο με ἐκ χειρὸς τοῦ λέοντος καὶ ἐκ χειρὸς τῆς ἄρ-
κτου, οὗτος ἐξελεῖταί με ἐκ χειρὸς τοῦ ἀλλοφύλου τοῦ ἀπεριτμή-
του τούτου· καὶ εἶπε Σαούλ πρὸς Δαυίδ, πορεύου, καὶ Κύριος
ἔσται μετὰ σοῦ. 38 Καὶ ἐνέδυσε Σαοὺλ τὸν μανδύαν αὐτοῦ, καὶ
περικεφαλαίαν χαλκῆν ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ. 39 Καὶ ἔζωσε Δαυίδ
θώρακα, καὶ περιεζώσατο Δαυὶδ τὴν ῥομφαίαν αὐτοῦ ἐπάνω τοῦ
μανδύου αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐκοπίασε περιπατῆσαι ἅπαξ καὶ δίς· καὶ εἶπε
Δαυίδ πρὸς Σαούλ, οὐ μὴ δύνομαι ἐν τούτοις πορευθῆναι, ἔτι οὐ
πεπείραμαι· καὶ ἀφαιροῦσιν αὐτὰ ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ. 40 Καὶ ἔλαβε τὴν βα-
κτηρίαν αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐξελέξατο ἑαυτῷ πέντε λί-
θους ἐκ τοῦ χειμάῤῥου, καὶ ἔθετο αὐτὸς ἐν τῷ καδίῳ τῷ ποι-
μενικῷ· τῷ ὄντι αὐτῷ εἰς συλλογήν, καὶ σφενδόνην αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ
χειρὶ αὐτοῦ. 41 Καὶ προσῆλθε πρὸς τὸν ἄνδρα τὸν ἀλλόφυλον. Καὶ
ἐπορεύθη ὁ ἀλλόφυλος παρευόμενος. καὶ ἐγγίζων πρὸς Δαυίδ, καὶ

29 wherefore hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the wickedness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle."

Then David said, "What have I done now? Was it not but a word?"

30 And he turned from him unto another, and spake according to these same words; and the people answered him according to the word of the first [one].

31 And the words which David spake were heard, and they were told to Saul. And he took him [unto himself].

32 And David said unto Saul, "Let not the heart of my lord fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine."

33 And Saul said unto David, "Thou shalt not be able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth."

34 And David said unto Saul, "Thy servant was a shepherd to his father among the flock; and when there came a lion, or a bear,

35 and took a lamb out of the flock—then I went out after him, and smote him, and plucked [the prey] out of his mouth; and if he arose against me, I caught him by his throat, and smote him, and slew him.

36 Both the lion and the bear thy servant smote; and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as among these. Shall I not go and smite him, and take away the reproach this day from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised one, who hath defied the array of the Living God?"

37 And David said, "The LORD who delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, He shall deliver me out of the hand of this uncircumcised Philistine."

And Saul said unto David, "Go, and the LORD be with thee."

38 And Saul clad [David] with his mantle, and placed a helmet of bronze upon his head.

39 And David girt on a breastplate, and girded his sword upon his mantle. And he essayed to walk once and twice; and David said unto Saul, "I cannot go forth with these, for I have not proven them." And they took them off him.

40 And he took his staff in his hand; and he chose for himself five smooth stones out of the brook, and he himself put [them] in his shepherd's bag, which was for gathering [stones]; and his sling was in his hand.

41 And he drew near unto the Philistine. And the Philistine went, advancing and drawing nigh unto David, and
