8 Καὶ ταῦτα τὰ ὀνόματα αὐτῶν· Βὲν υἱὸς Ὠρ ἐν ὄρει Ἐφραίμ.
9 Υἱὸς Δακὰρ ἐν Μαγμάς, καὶ ἐν Σαλαβείμ, καὶ Βεθσαμύς, καὶ
10 Αἰλὼν ἕως Βηθανάν. Υἱὸς Ἐσεδ ἐν Ἀραβώθ, αὐτοῦ Σωχὼ καὶ
11 πᾶσα ἡ γῆ Ὀφέρ. Υἱοῦ Ἀβιναδὰβ πᾶσα Νεφαθδὼρ, Τεφαθ θυ-
12 γάτηρ Σαλωμὼν ἦν αὐτῷ εἰς γυναῖκα. Βαανὰ υἱὸς Ἀχιλουδ τὴν
    Θαναὰχ καὶ Μαγεδδώ, καὶ πᾶς ὁ οἶκος Σὰν ὁ παρὰ Σεσθὰν
    ὑποκάτω τοῦ Ἰζραήλ, καὶ ἐκ Βεθσὰν ἕως Ἀβελμαουλὰ ἕως Μαεβὲρ
    Λουκὰμ εἷς.
13 Υἱὸς Γαβὲρ ἐν Ῥαμὼ Γαλαάδ· αὐτῷ (δ) Αὐδὼ Ἰαεὶρ υἱοῦ Μανασσῆ,
    Γαλαὰδ, τούτῳ σχέτινισμα Ἐργάβ ἢ ἐν τῇ Βασὰν, ἑξήκοντα πόλεις,
    μεγάλαι τειχήρεις, καὶ μοχλοὶ χαλκοῖ.
14 Ἀχιναδὰβ υἱὸς Ἀδδὼ Μανααίμ.

19 Γαβὲρ υἱὸς Ἀδαὶ, ἐν τῇ γῇ Γαλαάδ, γῇ Σηὼν βασιλέως Ἑσεβὼν, τοῦ
    Ἀμορραίου, καὶ Ὤγ βασιλέως τοῦ Βασὰν, καὶ Νασὶφ εἰς ἐν γῇ.
20 Ἰούδα καὶ Ἰσραὴλ πολλοὶ ὡς ἡ ἄμμος ἢ ἐπὶ τῆς θαλάσσης εἰς
21 πλῆθος, ἔσθοντες, καὶ πίνοντες καὶ εὐφραινόμενοι. Καὶ Σαλωμὼν
    ἦν ἐξουσιάζων ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς βασιλείοις, ἀπὸ τοῦ ποταμοῦ γῆς ἀλλο-
    φύλων, καὶ ἕως ὁρίου Αἰγύπτου· προσεγγίζοντες δῶρα, καὶ δου-
22 λεύοντες τῷ Σαλωμὼν πάσας ἡμέρας ζωῆς αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ταῦτα τὰ
    ἔθοντα Σαλωμὼν ἐν ἡμέρᾳ μιᾷ· τριάκοντα χόροι σεμιδάλεως, καὶ
23 ἑξήκοντα χόροι ἀλεύρου κεκοπανισμένου· δέκα μόσχοι ἐκλεκτοὶ,
    καὶ εἴκοσι βόες νομάδες, καὶ ἑκατὸν πρόβατα, ἐκτὸς ἐλάφων, καὶ
24 δορκάδων, καὶ ὀρνίθων, ἐκλεκτὰ ἐκλεκτῶν σιτευτά. Ὅτι ἦν ἄρ-
    χων ἐν παντὶ πέραν τοῦ ποταμοῦ ἀπὸ Θάψα καὶ ἕως Γάζης, ἐν
    πᾶσι βασιλεῦσι πέραν τοῦ ποταμοῦ· καὶ εἰρήνη ἦν αὐτῷ ἐκ πάν-
25 των τῶν μερῶν κυκλόθεν. Καὶ κατώκει Ἰούδας καὶ Ἰσραὴλ
    πεποιθότες, ἕκαστος ὑπὸ τὴν ἄμπελον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὑπὸ τὴν συ-
    κῆν αὐτοῦ, ἐσθίοντες καὶ πίνοντες, ἀπὸ Δὰν καὶ ἕως Βηρσαβεέ,
26 πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας Σαλωμών. Καὶ ἦν τῷ Σαλωμὼν τεσσαράκοντα
    χιλιάδες τοκάδες ἵππων εἰς ἄρματα, καὶ δώδεκα χιλιάδες ἱππέων.
27 Καὶ ἐχορήγουν οἱ καθεσταμένοι οὕτως τῷ βασιλεῖ ὁ Σαλωμὼν,
    καὶ πάντα τὰ διαγγέλματα ἐπὶ τὴν τράπεζαν τοῦ βασιλέως, ἕκα-
    στος μῆνα αὐτοῦ· οὐ παραλλάσσουσι λόγον.
28 Καὶ τὰς κριθὰς καὶ τὸ ἄχυρον τοῖς ἵπποις καὶ τοῖς ἅρμασιν ἤγον
    εἰς τὸν τόπον οὗ ἂν ᾖ ὁ βασιλεύς, ἕκαστος κατὰ τὴν σύνταξιν αὐτοῦ.

### A Royal Translation of the Third Book of Kingdoms, Chapter 4

**8** And these were their names: Ben the son of Hur, in the Mount of Ephraim.

**9** The son of Dakar, in Magmas, and in Salabeim, and Bethsamys;

**10** and Ailon, even unto Bethanan. The son of Esed, in Araboth; to him belonged Socho and

**11** all the land of Opher. To the son of Abinadab belonged all Nephathdor; Tephath, the daugh-

**12** -ter of Solomon, was his wife. Baana the son of Achilud [was over] Taanach and Megiddo, and all the house of San that is by Sesthan, beneath Jezreel, and from Bethsan unto Abelmaoula, even unto Maeber Lucam, one.

**13** The son of Gaber, in Ramoth-Gilead; to him (δ) Audō Jair, the son of Manasseh, [in] Gilead, [belonged] the district of Ergab, or in Bashan—sixty great walled cities, with bars of bronze.

**14** Ahinadab the son of Addo, in Mahanaim.

**15** Ahimaas, in Naphtali; and

**16** he took Basemath, the daughter of Solomon, to be his wife.

**17** Baanas the son of Chousei, in Asher and in Basaloth. Jehoshaphat the son of Pharoudou, in Issachar.

**18** Semeei the son of Ela, in Benjamin.

**19** Gaber the son of Adai, in the land of Gilead, the land of Sihon, king of Heshbon, of the Amorites, and Og, king of Bashan; and Nasiph into in the land.

**20** And Judah and Israel were many, as the sand or upon the seashore for a

**21** multitude, eating, and drinking, and rejoicing. And Solomon held sway over all the kingdoms, from the River of the land of the Philistines, even unto the border of Egypt; [they were] bringing gifts, and ser-

**22** -ving Solomon all the days of his life. And these were the customary [things] of Solomon for one day: thirty measures of fine flour, and

**23** sixty measures of ground meal; ten choice calves, and twenty fatted oxen, and one hundred sheep, besides harts, and

**24** gazelles, and birds, [even] the choicest of the choice, well-fed. For he was a ruler over all beyond the River, from Thapsa even unto Gaza, over all the kings beyond the River; and he had peace from all

**25** sides roundabout. And Judah and Israel dwelt securely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, eating and drinking, from Dan even unto Beersheba,

**26** all the days of Solomon. And Solomon had forty thousand breeding mares for chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.

**27** And these appointed officers made provision for the king, Solomon, and all the supplies for the king's table, each in his month; they did not fail in their appointed task.

**28** And the barley and the straw for the horses and for the chariots they brought into the place where the king was, each according to his appointed portion.
