ΚΕΦ. Βʹ. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Δʹ.
Ἱπποι πυρός, καὶ διέστειλαν ἀναμέσον ἀμφοτέρων· καὶ ἀνελήφθη
**12** Ἠλιοὺ ἐν συσσεισμῷ εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν. Καὶ Ἐλισσαιὲ ἔβοά· πάτερ, πάτερ, ἅρμα Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἱππεὺς αὐτοῦ· καὶ οὐκ ἴδεν
αὐτὸν ἔτι· καὶ ἐπελάβετο τῶν ἱματίων αὐτοῦ, καὶ διέρρηξεν αὐτὰ
**13** εἰς δύο ῥήγματα. Καὶ ὕψωσε τὴν μηλωτὴν Ἠλιοῦ, ἣ ἔπεσεν ἐπά-
νωθεν Ἐλισσαιέ· καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν Ἐλισσαιέ, καὶ ἔστη ἐπὶ τοῦ χεί-
**14** λους τοῦ Ἰορδάνου. Καὶ ἔλαβε τὴν μηλωτὴν Ἠλιοῦ, ἣ ἔπεσεν
ἐπάνωθεν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπάταξε τὸ ὕδωρ, καὶ εἶπε· ποῦ Κύριος ὁ
Θεὸς Ἠλιοὺ ἀφφώ; καὶ ἐπάταξε τὰ ὕδατα, καὶ διερράγησαν ἔνθεν
**15** καὶ ἔνθεν· καὶ διέβη Ἐλισσαιέ. Καὶ εἶδον αὐτὸν οἱ υἱοὶ τῶν προ-
φητῶν οἱ ἐν Ἱεριχὼ ἐξεναντίας, καὶ εἶπον· ἐπαναπέπαυται τὸ πνεῦ-
μα Ἠλιοὺ ἐπὶ Ἐλισσαιέ. Καὶ ἦλθον εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ προ-
**16** σεκύνησαν αὐτῷ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, καὶ εἶπον πρὸς αὐτόν· Ἰδοὺ δὴ μετὰ
τῶν παίδων σου οἱ υἱοὶ δυνάμεως πεντήκοντα ἄνδρες· πορευθέντες
δὴ ζητησάτωσαν τὸν κύριόν σου, μή ποτε ἦρεν αὐτὸν πνεῦμα Κυ-
ρίου, καὶ ἔρριψεν αὐτὸν ἐν τῷ Ἰορδάνῃ· ἢ ἐφ᾽ ἓν τῶν ὀρέων, ἢ
**17** ἐφ᾽ ἕνα τῶν βουνῶν· Καὶ εἶπεν Ἐλισσαιέ· οὐκ ἀποστελεῖτε. Καὶ
παρεβιάσαντο αὐτόν, ἕως ὅτου ἠσχύνετο· καὶ εἶπεν· ἀποστείλατε.
Καὶ ἀπέστειλαν πεντήκοντα ἄνδρας, καὶ ἐζήτησαν τρεῖς ἡμέρας,
**18** καὶ οὐχ εὗρον αὐτόν. Καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν πρὸς αὐτόν· καὶ αὐτὸς ἐκά-
θητο ἐν Ἱεριχώ· καὶ εἶπεν Ἐλισσαιὲ πρὸς αὐτούς· οὐκ εἶπον ὑμῖν,
**19** μὴ πορευθῆτε; Καὶ εἶπον οἱ ἄνδρες τῆς πόλεως πρὸς Ἐλισσαιέ·
ἰδοὺ ἡ κατοίκησις τῆς πόλεως ἀγαθή, καθώς ὁ κύριος βλέπει, καὶ
**20** τὰ ὕδατα πονηρά, καὶ ἡ γῆ ἀτεκνουμένη. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἐλισσαιέ·
Λάβετέ μοι ὑδρίσκην καινήν, καὶ θέτε ἐκεῖ ἅλα. καὶ ἔλαβον πρὸς
**21** αὐτόν. Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Ἐλισσαιὲ εἰς τὴν διέξοδον τῶν ὑδάτων, καὶ
ἔρριψεν ἐκεῖ ἅλα, καὶ εἶπε· τάδε λέγει Κύριος· ἴαμαι τὰ ὕδατα
**22** ταῦτα, οὐκ ἔσται ἔτι ἐκεῖθεν θάνατος, καὶ ἀτεκνουμένη. Καὶ ἰά-
θησαν τὰ ὕδατα ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα Ἐλισσαιὲ
ὃ ἐλάλησε.
**23** Καὶ ἀνέβη ἐκεῖθεν εἰς Βαιθήλ· καὶ ἀναβαίνοντος αὐτοῦ
ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ, καὶ παιδάρια μικρὰ ἐξῆλθον ἐκ τῆς πόλεως, καὶ κα-
τέπαιζον αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπον αὐτῷ· ἀνάβαινε φαλακρέ, ἀνάβαινε φα-
**24** λακρέ. Καὶ ἐξένευσεν ὀπίσω αὐτῶν, καὶ ἴδεν αὐτά, καὶ κατηράσα-
το αὐτοῖς ἐν ὀνόματι Κυρίου, καὶ εἶπε· τέκνα παραβάσεως καὶ
ἀργίας. Καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐξῆλθον δύο ἄρκοι ἐκ τοῦ δρυμοῦ, καὶ ἀνέρρη-
**25** ξαν ἐξ αὐτῶν δύο καὶ τεσσαράκοντα παῖδας. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἐκεῖ-

horses of fire, and they parted the two of them asunder; and Elijah was taken up by a whirlwind into heaven.
**12** And Elisha saw [it], and he cried out, "My father, my father! The chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof!" And he saw him no more. And he laid hold upon his own garments, and rent them in two pieces.
**13** And he took up the mantle of Elijah that fell from above him; and Elisha turned back, and stood by the bank of the Jordan.
**14** And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from above him, and smote the waters, and said, "Where is the Lord, the God of Elijah, even He?" And when he had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither; and Elisha went over.
**15** And when the sons of the prophets which were at Jericho saw him from afar, they said, "The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha." And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him,
**16** and said unto him, "Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the Lord hath taken him up, and cast him into the Jordan, or upon one of the mountains, or upon one of the hills."
**17** And Elisha said, "Ye shall not send." But they urged him till he was ashamed; and he said, "Send." They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought [for him] three days,
**18** but found him not. And they returned to him (for he tarried at Jericho); and Elisha said unto them, "Did I not say unto you, 'Go not'?"
**19** And the men of the city said unto Elisha, "Behold, the dwelling of this city is pleasant, as our lord discerns, but the water is naught, and the land doth bring forth barrenness."
**20** And Elisha said, "Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein." And they brought it to him.
**21** And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, "Thus saith the Lord, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thenceforth any more death or barrenness."
**22** So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spake.
**23** And he went up from thence unto Bethel; and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, "Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head!"
**24** And he turned back after them, and looked on them, and cursed them in the Name of the Lord. And he said, "Children of transgression and of idleness!" And, behold, there came forth two she-bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of their number.
**25** And he went from thence
