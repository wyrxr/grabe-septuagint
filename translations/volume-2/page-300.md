Κύριε, ἔστωσαν δὴ οἱ ὀφθαλμοί σου ἀνεῳγμένοι, καὶ τὰ ὦτά σου
⁴¹ ἐπήκοα εἰς τὴν δέησιν τοῦ τόπου τούτου. Καὶ νῦν ἀνάστηθι, Κύ-
ριε ὁ Θεός, εἰς τὴν κατάπαυσίν σου, σὺ καὶ ἡ κιβωτὸς τῆς ἰσχύος
σου. Οἱ ἱερεῖς σου, Κύριε ὁ Θεός, ἐνδύσαιντο σωτηρίαν, καὶ οἱ
⁴² υἱοί σου εὐφρανθήτωσαν ἐν ἀγαθοῖς. Κύριε ὁ Θεός, μὴ ἀποστρέ-
ψῃς τὸ πρόσωπον τοῦ χριστοῦ σου, μνήσθητι τὰ ἐλέη Δαυΐδ τοῦ
δούλου σου.

ΚΕΦ. Ζʹ. VII.

¹ ΚΑΙ ὡς συνετέλεσε Σολομὼν προσευχόμενος, καὶ τὸ πῦρ κατ-
ἔβη ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ κατέφαγε τὰ ὁλοκαυτώματα, καὶ τὰς
² θυσίας, καὶ δόξα Κυρίου ἔπλησε τὸν οἶκον, καὶ οὐκ ἠδύναντο οἱ
ἱερεῖς εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ, ὅτι
³ ἔπλησε δόξα Κυρίου τὸν οἶκον. Καὶ πάντες υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἑώρων
καταβαῖνον τὸ πῦρ, καὶ ἡ δόξα Κυρίου ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον· καὶ ἔπεσαν
ἐπὶ πρόσωπον ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ἐπὶ τὸ λιθόστρωτον, καὶ προσεκύνη-
σαν, καὶ ᾔνουν τῷ Κυρίῳ, ὅτι ἀγαθόν, ὅτι εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τὸ ἔλεος
⁴ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς θύοντες θύματα ἔναντι
⁵ Κυρίου· καὶ ἐθυσίασεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Σολομὼν τὴν θυσίαν μόσχων
εἴκοσι καὶ δύο χιλιάδας, καὶ βοσκημάτων ἑκατὸν καὶ εἴκοσι χι-
λιάδας, καὶ ἐνεκαίνισε τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Θεοῦ ὁ βασιλεύς, καὶ πᾶς ὁ
⁶ λαός. Καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς ἐπὶ τὰς φυλακὰς ἑαυτῶν ἑστηκότες, καὶ οἱ
Λευῖται ἐν ὀργάνοις ᾠδῶν Κυρίου τοῦ Δαυΐδ τοῦ βασιλέως, τοῦ
ἐξομολογεῖσθαι ἔναντι Κυρίου, ὅτι εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ,
ἐν ὕμνοις Δαυΐδ διὰ χειρὸς αὐτῶν· καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς σαλπίζοντες ταῖς
⁷ σάλπιγξιν ἐναντίον αὐτῶν, καὶ πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ ἑστηκώς. Καὶ ἡγία-
σε Σαλωμὼν τὸ μέσον τῆς αὐλῆς τῆς ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου, ὅτι ἐποίη-
σεν ἐκεῖ τὰ ὁλοκαυτώματα, καὶ τὰ στέατα τῶν σωτηρίων, ὅτι τὸ
θυσιαστήριον τὸ χαλκοῦν ὁ ἐξέποιει δέξασθαι τὰ ὁλοκαυτώματα,
καὶ τὰ μανά, καὶ τὰ στέατα.
⁸ Καὶ ἐποίησε Σαλωμὼν τὴν ἑορτὴν ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας,
καὶ πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, ἐκκλησία μεγάλη σφόδρα ἀπὸ εἰσόδου
⁹ Αἰμάθ, καὶ ἕως χειμάρρου Αἰγύπτου. Καὶ ἐποίησεν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ
τῇ ὀγδόῃ ἐξόδιον, ὅτι ἐγκαινισμὸν τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας
¹⁰ ἐποίησεν ἑορτήν, καὶ ἐν τῇ τρίτῃ καὶ εἰκάδι τοῦ μηνὸς τοῦ ἑβδό-

⁴⁰ O Lord, let Thy eyes be open now, and Thine ears
⁴¹ attentive unto the supplication of this place. Now therefore, O Lord God, arise to Thy resting place, Thou, and the ark of Thy strength. Let Thy priests, O Lord God, be clothed with salvation; and let Thy sons
⁴² rejoice in good things. O Lord God, turn not away the face of Thine anointed; remember the mercies of David Thy servant.

CHAPTER 7.

¹ And when Solomon had finished praying, then the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offerings and the
² sacrifices; and the glory of the Lord filled the house. And the priests could not enter into the house of the Lord at that time, because
³ the glory of the Lord had filled the house. And all the children of Israel beheld the fire coming down, and the glory of the Lord upon the house; and they fell upon their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, and gave praise unto the Lord, [saying], "For He is good, for His mercy endureth forever."
⁴ Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before
⁵ the Lord. And King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and of one hundred and twenty thousand sheep; and so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.
⁶ And the priests stood at their watches, and the Levites with the instruments of the songs of the Lord, which King David had made to give thanks unto the Lord, "for His mercy endureth forever," with the hymns of David by their hands; and the priests sounded with the
⁷ trumpets over against them, and all Israel stood. Moreover, Solomon consecrated the middle of the court that was before the house of the Lord; for there he offered burnt offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the brazen altar which Solomon had made could not receive the burnt offerings, and the manna, and the fat [portions].
⁸ At that time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of
⁹ Hamath unto the Brook of Egypt. And upon the eighth day he made a solemn assembly; for the dedication of the altar he had made a feast of seven days,
