ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Γ´. ΚΕΦ. Α´.
    συμβουλίαν καὶ ἐξελοῦ τὴν ψυχὴν σου, καὶ τὴν ψυχὴν τοῦ υἱοῦ
13 σου Σαλωμών. Δεῦρο εἴσελθε πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Δαυίδ, καὶ ἐρεῖς
πρὸς αὐτόν, λέγουσα· οὐχὶ σύ, κύριέ μου βασιλεῦ, ὤμοσας τῇ
δούλῃ σου, λέγων· ὅτι Σαλωμὼν ὁ υἱός σου βασιλεύσει μετ᾿ ἐμέ,
καὶ αὐτὸς καθίσταται ἐπὶ τοῦ θρόνου μου; καὶ τί ὅτι ἐβασίλευ-
14 σεν Ἀδωνίας; Καὶ ἰδοὺ ἔτι σου λαλούσης ἐκεῖ μετὰ τοῦ βασιλέως,
καὶ ἐγὼ εἰσελεύσομαι ὀπίσω σου, καὶ πληρώσω τοὺς λόγους σου.
15 Καὶ εἰσῆλθε Βηθσαβεὲ πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα εἰς τὸ ταμεῖον. Καὶ ὁ
βασιλεὺς πρεσβύτης σφόδρα. Καὶ Ἀβισὰγ ἡ Σωμανῖτις λειτουργοῦσα
16 τῷ βασιλεῖ. Καὶ ἔκυψε Βηθσαβεέ, καὶ προσεκύνησε τῷ βασιλεῖ.
17 Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεύς· τί ἔστι σοι; Ἡ δὲ εἶπε· κύριέ μου βασιλεῦ,
σὺ ὤμοσας ἐν Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ σου τῇ δούλῃ σου, λέγων· ὅτι Σαλωμὼν
ὁ υἱός σου βασιλεύσει μετ᾿ ἐμὲ καὶ αὐτὸς καθήσεται ἐπὶ τοῦ θρόνου
18 μου· καὶ νῦν ἰδοὺ Ἀδωνίας ἐβασίλευσε, καὶ σύ, κύριέ μου βασιλεῦ,
19 οὐκ ἔγνως. Καὶ ἐθυσίασε μόσχους, καὶ ἄρνας, καὶ πρόβατα εἰς
πλῆθος, καὶ ἐκάλεσε πάντας τοὺς υἱοὺς τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ Ἀβιάθαρ
τὸν ἱερέα, καὶ Ἰωὰβ τὸν ἄρχοντα τῆς δυνάμεως, καὶ τὸν Σαλωμὼν
20 τὸν δοῦλόν σου οὐκ ἐκάλεσε. Καὶ σύ, κύριέ μου βασιλεῦ, οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ
παντὸς Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς σέ· ἀπάγγειλαι αὐτοῖς τίς καθήσεται ἐπὶ τοῦ
21 θρόνου τοῦ κυρίου μου τοῦ βασιλέως μετ᾿ αὐτόν. Καὶ ἔσται ὡς ἂν
κοιμηθῇ ὁ κύριός μου ὁ βασιλεὺς μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ,
22 καὶ ἔσομαι ἐγὼ καὶ ὁ υἱός μου Σαλωμὼν ἁμαρτωλοί. Καὶ ἰδοὺ ἔτι
αὐτῆς λαλούσης μετὰ τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ Νάθαν ὁ προφήτης ἦλθε.
23 Καὶ ἀνηγγέλη τῷ βασιλεῖ, λεγόντων· ἰδοὺ Νάθαν ὁ προφήτης· καὶ
εἰσῆλθε κατὰ τὸ πρόσωπον τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ προσεκύνησε τῷ βασιλεῖ
24 κατὰ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν. Καὶ εἶπε Νάθαν, κύριέ μου βασιλεῦ,
σὺ εἶπας, Ἀδωνίας βασιλεύσει ὀπίσω μου, καὶ αὐτὸς καθήσεται ἐπὶ
25 τοῦ θρόνου μου; ῞Οτι κατέβη σήμερον καὶ ἐθυσίασε μόσχους, καὶ
ἄρνας, καὶ πρόβατα εἰς πλῆθος, καὶ ἐκάλεσε πάντας τοὺς υἱοὺς τοῦ
βασιλέως, καὶ τοὺς ἄρχοντας τῆς δυνάμεως, καὶ Ἀβιάθαρ τὸν ἀρχιερέα.
Καὶ ἰδοὺ εἰσὶν ἐσθίοντες καὶ πίνοντες ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπαν·
Ζήτω ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἀδωνίας. 26 Καὶ ἐμὲ αὐτὸν τὸν δοῦλόν σου, καὶ
Σαδὼκ τὸν ἱερέα, καὶ Βαναίαν υἱὸν Ἰωιαδαέ, καὶ Σαλωμὼν τὸν
δοῦλόν σου οὐκ ἐκάλεσεν. 27 Εἰ διὰ τοῦ κυρίου μου τοῦ βασιλέως
γέγονε τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο,

**12** counsel, and deliver thy life, and the life of thy son, Solomon.
**13** Go thou in now unto King David, and say unto him thus: "Didst thou not, my lord the King, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, 'Surely Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall be established upon my throne?' And how then is it that Adonijah hath become king?"
**14** "And behold, while thou art yet speaking there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and shall confirm thy words."
**15** So Bathsheba went in unto the king into his private chamber. Now the king was exceeding old, and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering unto the king.
**16** And Bathsheba bowed herself, and did obeisance to the king.
**17** And the king said, "What wouldest thou?" And she answered him, "My lord, thou didst swear by the Lord thy God unto thine handmaid, saying, 'Surely Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he himself shall sit upon my throne.'
**18** And now, behold, Adonijah hath become king, and thou, my lord the King, hast not known it.
**19** For he hath sacrificed calves and lambs and sheep in great abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the commander of the host; but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.
**20** And as for thee, my lord the King, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest declare unto them who shall sit upon the throne of my lord the King after him.
**21** For it shall come to pass, when my lord the King shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be reckoned as offenders."
**22** And behold, while she was yet speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet did come.
**23** And it was told the king, saying, "Behold, Nathan the prophet is here." And he came in before the face of the king, and bowed himself down before the king upon his face to the ground.
**24** And Nathan said, "My lord the King, didst thou indeed say, 'Adonijah shall reign after me, and he himself shall sit upon my throne?'
**25** For he hath gone down this day, and hath sacrificed calves, and lambs, and sheep in great abundance, and hath called all the king's sons, and the commanders of the host, and Abiathar the high priest. And behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and have cried out, saying, 'Long live King Adonijah!'
**26** But me, even thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Solomon thy servant, hath he not called.
**27** If this thing hath indeed been done by the command of my lord the King,
