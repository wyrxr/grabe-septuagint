16. (cont.) καὶ τοὺς θυρεοὺς καὶ τὰ τόξα καὶ οἱ θώρακες καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες
17. ὀπίσω παντὸς οἴκου Ἰούδα, τῶν οἰκοδομούντων ἐν τῷ τείχει. καὶ οἱ αἴροντες ἐν τοῖς ἀρτηρσιν ἐν ὅπλοις· ἐν μιᾷ χειρὶ ἐποίει
18. ἑαυτοῦ τὸ ἔργον, καὶ ἐν μιᾷ ἐκράτει τὴν βολίδα. Καὶ οἱ οἰκοδομοῦντες, ἀνὴρ ῥομφαίαν ἑαυτοῦ ἐζωσμένος ἐπὶ τὴν ὀσφῦν ἑαυτοῦ, καὶ
19. ᾠκοδομοῦσαν. καὶ ὁ σαλπίζων ἐν τῇ κερατίνῃ ἐχόμενα αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπα πρὸς τοὺς ἐντίμους, καὶ πρὸς τοὺς ἄρχοντας, καὶ πρὸς τοὺς καταλοίπους τοῦ λαοῦ· τὸ ἔργον πλατύ, καὶ πολύ, καὶ ἡμεῖς σκορπιζόμεθα ἐπὶ τοῦ τείχους μακρὰν ἀνὴρ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ.
20. Ἐν τόπῳ ᾧ ἐὰν ἀκούσητε τὴν φωνὴν τῆς κερατίνης, ἐκεῖ συναχθήσεσθε πρὸς ἡμᾶς, καὶ ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν πολεμήσει περὶ ἡμῶν.
21. Καὶ ἡμεῖς ποιοῦντες τὸ ἔργον, καὶ ἥμισυ αὐτῶν κρατοῦντες τὰς λόγχας ἀπὸ ἀναβάσεως τοῦ ὄρθρου ἕως ἐξόδου τῶν ἄστρων.
22. Καὶ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ εἶπα τῷ λαῷ· ἕκαστος μετὰ τοῦ νεανίσκου αὐτοῦ αὐλισθήτω ἐν μέσῳ Ἱερουσαλήμ· καὶ ἔστω ὑμῖν ἡ νὺξ προφυλακή, καὶ ἡ ἡμέρα ἔργον.
23. Καὶ ἤμην ἐγώ, καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες τῆς προφυλακῆς ὀπίσω μου, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἐξ ἡμῶν ἐκδιδυσκόμενος ἀνὴρ τὰ ἱμάτια ἑαυτοῦ.

1. ΚΑΙ ἦν κραυγὴ τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ γυναικῶν αὐτῶν μεγάλη πρὸς
2. τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς ἑαυτῶν τοὺς Ἰουδαίους. Καὶ ἦσαν τινες λέγοντες· ἐν υἱοῖς ἡμῶν καὶ ἐν θυγατράσιν ἡμῶν ἡμεῖς πολλοί, καὶ ληψόμεθα σῖτον, καὶ φαγόμεθα καὶ ζησόμεθα.
3. Καὶ εἰσὶ τινες λέγοντες· ἀγροὶ ἡμῶν καὶ ἀμπελῶνες ἡμῶν καὶ οἰκίαι ἡμῶν, ἡμεῖς διεγγυῶμεν, καὶ ληψόμεθα σῖτον καὶ φαγόμεθα.
4. Καὶ εἰσὶ τινες λέγοντες· ἐδανεισάμεθα ἀργύριον εἰς φόρους τοῦ βασιλέως, ἀγροὶ ἡμῶν καὶ
5. ἀμπελῶνες ἡμῶν καὶ οἰκίαι ἡμῶν. Καὶ νῦν ὡς σάρξ ἀδελφῶν ἡμῶν, σάρξ ἡμῶν· ὡς υἱοὶ αὐτῶν, υἱοὶ ἡμῶν· καὶ ἰδοὺ ἡμεῖς καταδυναστεύομεν τοὺς υἱοὺς ἡμῶν καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας ἡμῶν εἰς δούλους, καὶ εἰσὶν ἀπὸ θυγατέρων ἡμῶν καταδυναστευόμεναι, καὶ οὐκ ἔστι δύναμις χειρῶν ἡμῶν, καὶ ἀγροὶ ἡμῶν καὶ ἀμπελῶνες ἡμῶν τοῖς
6. ἐντίμοις. Καὶ ἐλυπήθην σφόδρα καθὼς ἤκουσα τὴν κραυγὴν αὐτῶν καὶ τοὺς λόγους τούτους·
7. καὶ ἐβουλεύσατο καρδία μου ἐπ᾽ ἐμέ· καὶ ἐμαχεσάμην πρὸς τοὺς ἐντίμους καὶ τοὺς ἄρχοντας, καὶ εἶ-

#### CHAPTER IV.

<sup>16</sup> ...and the shields and the bows and the breastplates; and the rulers stood
<sup>17</sup> behind every house of Judah, of those who wrought upon the wall. And those who carried [burdens] in their baskets, [being] armed, with one hand did he perform
<sup>18</sup> his own work, and with one [hand] did he hold the dart. And the builders, each man having girded his own sword upon his own loins,
<sup>19</sup> they did build. And the one who blew the horn [stood] next to him. And I spake unto the nobles, and unto the rulers, and unto the remnant of the people, saying, "The work is wide, and [it is] great, and we are scattered upon the wall, each man far from his brother.
<sup>20</sup> In whatsoever place ye shall hear the sound of the horn, thither shall ye gather yourselves unto us: and our God shall fight for us."
<sup>21</sup> And we ourselves did the work, and half of them held the spears, from the dawning of the morning even until the going forth of the stars.
<sup>22</sup> And in that time I said unto the people, "Let each man lodge with his young man [or servant] in the midst of Jerusalem; and let the night be a watch unto you, and the day, a work."
<sup>23</sup> And I was [there], and the men of the guard behind me, and there was no man among us who did put off his own garments.

#### CHAPTER V.

<sup>1</sup> AND there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against
<sup>2</sup> their brethren, the Jews. And there were some who said, "We are many, both in our sons and in our daughters, and we shall obtain grain, and we shall eat, and we shall live."
<sup>3</sup> And there are some who say, "Our fields and our vineyards and our houses, we do mortgage [them], and we shall obtain grain, and we shall eat."
<sup>4</sup> And there are some who say, "We have borrowed money for the king's taxes, [pledging] our fields and
<sup>5</sup> our vineyards and our houses. And now, as the flesh of our brethren, [so is] our flesh; as their sons, [so are] our sons. And behold, we do oppress our sons and our daughters into bondservice, and there are some of our daughters being oppressed [into bondservice], and there is no strength in our hands, and our fields and our vineyards [are given] unto the
<sup>6</sup> nobles." And I was greatly grieved as I heard their cry and these words.
<sup>7</sup> And my heart took counsel within me; and I contended with the nobles and the rulers, and said...
