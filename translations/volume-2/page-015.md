ΚΕΦ. ςʹ. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Αʹ. 491
ἀποστῇ χεὶρ αὐτοῦ ἀφ᾿ ὑμῶν; Καὶ λέγουσι· τί τὸ τῆς βασάνου 4
ἀποδώσομεν αὐτῇ; Καὶ εἶπαν· κατὰ ἀριθμὸν τῶν σατραπῶν τῶν
ἀλλοφύλων πέντε ἕδρας χρυσᾶς καὶ πέντε μῦας χρυσούς, ὅτι
πταῖσμα ἐν ὑμῖν καὶ τοῖς ἄρχουσιν ὑμῶν, καὶ τῷ λαῷ. Καὶ 5
ποιήσετε ὁμοίωμα τῶν ἑδρῶν ὑμῶν, καὶ ὁμοίωμα τῶν μυῶν, ὑμῶν τῶν
διαφθειρόντων τὴν γῆν, καὶ δώσετε τῷ Κυρίῳ δόξαν, ὅπως **κουφίσῃ** τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἀφ᾿ ὑμῶν, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν θεῶν ὑμῶν, καὶ ἀπὸ
τῆς γῆς ὑμῶν. Καὶ ἱνατὶ βαρύνετε τὰς καρδίας ὑμῶν, ὡς ἐβά- 6
ρυνεν Αἴγυπτος καὶ Φαραὼ τὴν καρδίαν αὐτῶν; οὐχὶ ὅτε ἐνέπαιζεν
αὐτοῖς, ἐξαπέστειλαν αὐτούς, καὶ ἀπῆλθον; Καὶ νῦν λάβετε καὶ 7
ποιήσατε ἅμαξαν καινὴν μίαν, καὶ δύο βόας πρωτοτοκούσας ἄνευ
τῶν τέκνων, ἐφ᾿ ἃς οὐκ ἐπετέθη ζυγός· καὶ ζεύξατε τὰς βόας
ἐν τῇ ἁμάξῃ, καὶ ἀπαγάγετε τὰ τέκνα ἀπὸ ὄπισθεν αὐτῶν εἰς
οἶκον. Καὶ λήψεσθε τὴν κιβωτὸν Κυρίου, καὶ θήσετε αὐτὴν ἐπὶ 8
τὴν ἅμαξαν· καὶ τὰ σκεύη τὰ χρυσᾶ ἀποδώσετε αὐτῇ τῆς βασά-
νου, καὶ θήσετε ἐν θέματι Ἀργὺζ ἐκ μέρους αὐτῆς· καὶ ἐξ-
αποστελεῖτε αὐτήν, καὶ ἀπελεύσεται. Καὶ ὄψεσθε, εἰ εἰς ὁδὸν 9
ὁρίων αὐτῆς πορεύσεται (καὶ) κατὰ Βεθσαμύς, αὐτὸς πεποίηκεν
ἡμῖν τὴν κακίαν τὴν μεγάλην ταύτην· καὶ ἐὰν μή, καὶ γνωσό-
μεθα ὅτι οὐ χεὶρ αὐτοῦ ἥπτεται ἡμῶν, ἀλλὰ σύμπτωμα τοῦτο γέ-
γονεν ἡμῖν. Καὶ ἐποίησαν οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι οὕτως, καὶ ἔλαβον δύο 10
βόας πρωτοτοκούσας, καὶ ἔζευξαν αὐτὰς ἐν τῇ ἁμάξῃ, καὶ τὰ
τέκνα αὐτῶν ἀπεκώλυσαν εἰς οἶκον· καὶ ἔθεντο τὴν κιβωτὸν Κυρίου 11
ἐπὶ τὴν ἅμαξαν, καὶ τὸ θέμα Ἀργύζ, καὶ τοὺς μῦς τοὺς χρυσοῦς,
καὶ τὰς εἰκόνας τῶν ἑδρῶν αὐτῶν. Καὶ κατήθυναν αἱ βόες ἐν 12
τῇ ὁδῷ εἰς ὁδὸν Βεθσαμύς· ἐν τρίβῳ ἐν ᾗ ἐπορεύοντο καὶ ἐκοπίων, καὶ
οὐ μεθίσταντο δεξιὰ οὐδὲ ἀριστερά· καὶ οἱ σατράπαι τῶν ἀλλοφύλων
ἐπορεύοντο ὀπίσω αὐτῶν ἕως ὁρίων Βεθσαμύς. Καὶ οἱ ἐν Βεθσα- 13
μὺς ἐθέριζον θερισμὸν πυρῶν ἐν κοιλάδι· καὶ ἦραν ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτῶν,
καὶ ἴδαν κιβωτὸν Κυρίου, καὶ ηὐφράνθησαν εἰς ἀπάντησιν αὐτῆς.
Καὶ ἡ ἅμαξα εἰσῆλθεν εἰς ἀγρὸν Ἰησοῦ τὸν ἐν Βεθσαμύς, καὶ 14
ἔστησαν ἐκεῖ παρ᾿ αὐτὴν λίθον μέγαν, καὶ σχίζουσι τὰ ξύλα τῆς
ἁμάξης, καὶ τὰς βόας ἀνήνεγκαν ὁλοκάρπωσιν τῷ Κυρίῳ. Καὶ οἱ 15
Λευῖται ἀνήνεγκαν τὴν κιβωτὸν Κυρίου, καὶ τὸ θέμα Ἀργύζ, μετ᾿
αὐτῆς καὶ τὰ ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς σκεύη τὰ χρυσᾶ, καὶ ἔθεντο ἐπὶ τοῦ λίθου
τοῦ μεγάλου· καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες Βεθσαμὺς ἀνήνεγκαν ὁλοκαυτώσεις, καὶ

**Chapter 6**

4 "And they said, 'What recompense for the affliction shall we render unto it?' And they answered, 'According to the number of the satraps of the Philistines, ye shall make five golden emerods and five golden mice; for there is a transgression among you, and among your rulers, and among the people.'"

5 "And ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice, [even those] which corrupt the land; and ye shall give glory unto the Lord, that He may lighten His hand from upon you, and from upon your gods, and from upon your land."

6 "And wherefore do ye harden your hearts, as Egypt and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? Did they not, when He had afflicted them, send them away, and they departed?"

7 "And now take and make one new cart, and two milch cows which have calved for the first time, upon which no yoke hath yet been laid; and yoke the cows unto the cart, and lead away their calves from behind them unto the house."

8 "And ye shall take the Ark of the Lord, and lay it upon the cart; and the golden articles which ye render unto it for the affliction, ye shall place in the Arguz box by its side; and ye shall send it forth, and it shall go."

9 "And ye shall see, if it goeth by the way of its own border, even toward Bethsamys, then He Himself hath done unto us this great evil; but if not, then shall we know that it was not His hand that touched us, but that this hath happened unto us by chance."

10 And the Philistines did so; for they took two milch cows, and yoked them unto the cart, and shut up their calves in the house.

11 And they placed the Ark of the Lord upon the cart, and the Arguz offering-chest, and the golden mice, and the images of their emerods.

12 And the cows went straight on the way to Bethsamys, in the beaten path wherein they went and toiled, and they turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the satraps of the Philistines followed them unto the borders of Bethsamys.

13 And those of Bethsamys were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley; and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the Ark of the Lord, and rejoiced at its coming.

14 And the cart came into the field of Joshua of Bethsamys, and stood there beside a great stone; and they split the wood of the cart, and offered up the cows as a whole burnt offering unto the Lord.

15 And the Levites took down the Ark of the Lord, and the Arguz offering-chest, and the golden articles that were upon it with the Ark, and placed them upon the great stone; and the men of Bethsamys offered up burnt offerings, and...
