ΚΕΦ. Δ΄. IV.
Ρεμμὼν τοῦ Βηρωθαίου, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· Ζῇ Κύριος ὃς ἐλυτρώσατο τὴν ψυχήν μου ἐκ πάσης θλίψεως, ὅτι ὁ ἀπαγγείλας μοι
10 ὅτι τέθνηκε Σαούλ, καὶ αὐτὸς ἦν ὡς εὐαγγελιζόμενος ἐνώπιον ἐμοῦ, καὶ κατέσχον αὐτόν, καὶ ἀπέκτεινα αὐτὸν ἐν Σικελάγ, ᾧ
11 ἔδει με δοῦναι εὐαγγέλια. Καὶ νῦν ἄνδρες πονηροὶ ἀπεκτάγκασιν ἄνδρα δίκαιον ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τῆς κοίτης αὐτοῦ. Καὶ
νῦν ἐκζητήσω τὸ αἷμα αὐτοῦ ἐκ χειρὸς ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐξολοθρεύσω
12 ὑμᾶς ἐκ τῆς γῆς. Καὶ ἐνετείλατο Δαυὶδ τοῖς παιδαρίοις αὐτοῦ,
καὶ ἀποκτείνουσιν αὐτούς, καὶ κολοβοῦσι τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν καὶ
τοὺς πόδας αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐκρέμασαν αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ τῆς κρήνης ἐν Χεβρῶν, καὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν Μεμφιβοσθὲ ἔθαψαν ἐν τῷ τάφῳ Ἀβεννὴρ υἱοῦ Νήρ.

ΚΕΦ. Ε΄. V.
1 ΚΑὶ παραγίνονται πᾶσαι αἱ φυλαὶ Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς Δαυὶδ εἰς Χεβρῶν, καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῷ· Ἰδοὺ ὀστᾶ σου, καὶ σάρκες σου ἡμεῖς. Καὶ
2 ἐχθὲς καὶ τρίτην ὄντος Σαοὺλ βασιλέως ἐφ᾿ ἡμῶν, σὺ ἤσθα ὁ
εἰσάγων καὶ ἐξάγων τὸν Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς σέ· σὺ
ποιμανεῖς τὸν λαόν μου τὸν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ σὺ ἔσῃ εἰς ἡγούμενον
3 ἐπὶ τὸν Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἔρχονται πάντες οἱ πρεσβύτεροι Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς
τὸν βασιλέα εἰς Χεβρῶν, καὶ διεθέτο αὐτοῖς ὁ βασιλεὺς Δαυὶδ ἐν
Χεβρὼν ἐνώπιον Κυρίου διαθήκην, καὶ χρίουσι τὸν Δαυὶδ εἰς βασιλέα ἐπὶ πάντα Ἰσραήλ.
4 Υἱὸς τριάκοντα ἐτῶν ἦν Δαυὶδ ἐν τῷ βασιλεύειν αὐτόν, καὶ τεσσαράκοντα ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν.
5 Ἐν Χεβρὼν ἐβασίλευσεν ἐπὶ τὸν Ἰούδαν ἑπτὰ ἔτη καὶ ἓξ μῆνας, καὶ ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐβασίλευσε τριάκοντα καὶ τρία ἔτη ἐπὶ πάντα Ἰσραὴλ
καὶ Ἰούδαν.
6 Καὶ ἀπῆλθε Δαυὶδ καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες αὐτοῦ εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ πρὸς τὸν Ἰεβουσαῖον τὸν κατοικοῦντα τὴν γῆν. Καὶ
ἐῤῥέθη τῷ Δαυίδ· οὐκ εἰσελεύσῃ ὧδε, ὅτι ἀντέστησαν οἱ τυφλοὶ καὶ οἱ χωλοί, λέγοντες, ὅτι οὐκ εἰσελεύσεται Δαυὶδ ὧδε.
7 Καὶ κατελάβετο Δαυὶδ τὴν περιοχὴν Σιών· αὕτη ἡ πόλις τοῦ
Δαυίδ.
8 Καὶ εἶπε Δαυὶδ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ· πᾶς τύπτων Ἰεβουσαῖον, ἀπτέσθω ἐν παραξιφίδι καὶ τοὺς χωλούς, καὶ τοὺς τυφλοὺς
καὶ τοὺς μισοῦντας ψυχὴν Δαυίδ· διὰ τοῦτο ἐροῦσι· τυφλοὶ καὶ
9 χωλοὶ οὐκ εἰσελεύσονται εἰς οἶκον Κυρίου. Καὶ ἐκάθισε Δαυὶδ

**9** Rimmon the Beerothite, and he said unto them:
**10** "As the LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my soul from all distress, for when one brought me tidings, saying, 'Saul is dead,' and he was as one bringing glad news before me, then I seized him, and slew him in Ziklag, to whom I should have given [good] tidings.
**11** How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous man in his own house upon his bed? Shall I not now require his blood at your hand, and will utterly destroy you from the earth?"
**12** And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up over the well in Hebron. And the head of Mephibosheth they buried in the tomb of Abner the son of Ner.

### Chapter 5

**1** And all the tribes of Israel came unto David at Hebron, and spake unto him, saying:
**2** "Behold, thy bone and thy flesh are we. And in times past, even when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel. And the LORD said unto thee, 'Thou shalt shepherd My people Israel, and thou shalt be a leader over Israel.'"
**3** So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and King David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over all Israel.
**4** David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.
**5** In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.
**6** And David and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusite, the inhabitant of the land. And it was said unto David, "Thou shalt not come hither, for the blind and the lame resisted, saying, 'David shall not come hither.'"
**7** Nevertheless David captured the stronghold of Zion; the same is the City of David.
**8** And David said on that day, "Whosoever smiteth a Jebusite, let him assail [them] with a dagger, even the lame and the blind, and those who hate the soul of David." Therefore they shall say, "The blind and the lame shall not come into the house of the LORD."
**9** And David dwelt in the stronghold...
