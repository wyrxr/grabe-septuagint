**KΕΦ. Ε΄.**
**7** εἶπεν· εὐλογητὸς ὁ Θεὸς σήμερον, ὁ δοὺς τῷ Δαυὶδ υἱὸν φρόνιμον
**8** ἐπὶ τὸν λαὸν τὸν πολὺν τοῦτον. Καὶ ἀπέστειλε Χειρὰμ πρὸς Σαλωμὼν, λέγων· ἀκήκοα περὶ πάντων τῶν ἀπέσταλκας πρός με·
**9** ἐγὼ ποιήσω πᾶν θέλημά σου εἰς ξύλα κέδρινα καὶ πεύκινα. Οἱ δοῦλοί μου κατάξουσιν αὐτὰ ἐκ τοῦ Λιβάνου εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν, καὶ ἐγὼ θήσομαι αὐτὰ σχεδίας ἐν τῇ θαλάσσῃ, ἕως τοῦ τόπου οὗ ἂν ἀποστείλῃς πρός με, καὶ ἐκτινάξω αὐτὰ ἐκεῖ· καὶ σὺ ἀρεῖς,
**10** καὶ ποιήσεις τὸ θέλημά μου, τοῦ δοῦναι ἄρτους τῷ οἴκῳ μου. Καὶ ἦν Χειρὰμ διδούς τῷ Σαλωμὼν κέδρους, καὶ πεύκας, καὶ πᾶν
**11** θέλημα αὐτοῦ. Καὶ Σαλωμὼν ἔδωκε τῷ Χειρὰμ εἴκοσι χιλιάδας κόρων πυροῦ, καὶ μαγαλ τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἴκοσι χιλιάδας ἑθ ἐλαίου κεκομμένου· κατὰ τοῦτο ἐδίδου Σαλωμὼν τῷ Χειρὰμ κατ’ ἐνιαυτόν.
**12** Καὶ Κύριος ἔδωκε σοφίαν τῷ Σαλωμὼν καθὼς ἐλάλησεν αὐτῷ· καὶ ἦν εἰρήνη ἀναμέσον Χειρὰμ, καὶ ἀναμέσον Σαλωμὼν, καὶ διέθεντο διαθήκην ἀναμέσον ἑαυτῶν.
**13** Καὶ ἀνήνεγκεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Σαλωμὼν φόρον ἐκ παντὸς Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ ἦν ὁ φόρος τριάκοντα χιλιάδες ἀνδρῶν.
**14** Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν αὐτοὺς εἰς τὸν Λίβανον· δέκα χιλιάδες ἐν τῷ μηνὶ ἀλλασσόμεναι· μῆνα ἦσαν ἐν τῷ Λιβάνῳ, καὶ δύο μῆνας ἐν οἴκῳ αὐτῶν· καὶ Ἀδωνιρὰμ ἐπὶ τοῦ φόρου.
**15** Καὶ ἦν τῷ Σαλωμὼν ἑβδομήκοντα χιλιάδες αἴροντες ἄρσιν,
**16** καὶ ὀγδοήκοντα χιλιάδες λατόμων ἐν τῷ ὄρει, χωρὶς ἀρχόντων τῶν καθεσταμένων τῷ Σαλωμὼν ἐπὶ τῶν ἔργων, τρεῖς χιλιάδες
**17** καὶ πεντακόσιοι ἐπιστάται τοῦ λαοῦ οἱ ποιοῦντες τὰ ἔργα. Καὶ ἐνετείλατο ὁ βασιλεὺς, καὶ αἴρουσι λίθους μεγάλους, λίθους τιμίους εἰς τὸν θεμέλιον τοῦ οἴκου, καὶ λίθους ἀπελεκήτους.
**18** Καὶ ἐπελέκησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Σαλωμὼν, καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Χειρὰμ, καὶ οἱ Γίβλιοι, καὶ ἡτοίμασαν τὰ ξύλα καὶ τοὺς λίθους τρία ἔτη.

**KΕΦ. ς΄.**
**1** ΚΑΙ ἐγενήθη ἐν τῷ τεσσαρακοστῷ καὶ τετρακοσιοστῷ ἔτει τῆς ἐξόδου τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ ἐξ Αἰγύπτου, τῷ ἔτει τῷ τετάρτῳ ἐν μηνὶ τῷ δευτέρῳ βασιλεύοντος τοῦ βασιλέως Σαλωμὼν ἐπὶ Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ ᾠκοδόμει τὸν οἶκον τῷ Κυρίῳ.
**2** Καὶ ὁ οἶκος ὃν ᾠκοδόμησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Σαλωμὼν τῷ Κυρίῳ ἑξήκοντα πηχῶν μῆκος αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἴκοσιν ἐν πήχει πλάτος αὐτοῦ, καὶ τριάκοντα ἐν πήχει ὕψος αὐτοῦ.

### A Royal Translation of the Third Book of Kingdoms, Chapter 5

**7** and he said, "Blessed be the Lord God this day, who hath given unto David a wise son
**8** over this great people." And Hiram sent unto Solomon, saying, "I have heard all that thou hast sent unto me.
**9** I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedars and firs. My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea, and I will make them into rafts in the sea, unto the place whither thou shalt send unto me, and I will cast them ashore there; and thou shalt take [them],
**10** and thou shalt do my will, to give bread unto my house." And Hiram gave unto Solomon cedars and firs, and all
**11** his desire. And Solomon gave unto Hiram twenty thousand cors of wheat, and magal for his household, and twenty thousand eth of beaten oil: after this manner did Solomon give unto Hiram year by year.
**12** And the Lord gave wisdom unto Solomon, as He spake unto him; and there was peace between Hiram and between Solomon, and they made a covenant between themselves.
**13** And King Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.
**14** And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month in relays; a month they were in Lebanon, and two months in their own house: and Adoniram was over the levy.
**15** And Solomon had seventy thousand [men] that bare burdens,
**16** and eighty thousand hewers of stone in the mountain, besides the chief officers that were set over Solomon's work, three thousand
**17** and five hundred overseers of the people who performed the work. And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones for the foundation of the house, and unhewn stones.
**18** And the sons of Solomon, and the sons of Hiram, and the Giblians hewed [them], and they prepared the timbers and the stones for three years.

### Chapter 6

**1** Now it came to pass in the four hundred and fortieth year after the going forth of the sons of Israel out of Egypt, in the fourth year, in the second month of the reign of King Solomon over Israel, that he built the house unto the Lord.
**2** And the house which King Solomon built unto the Lord, the length thereof was sixty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.
