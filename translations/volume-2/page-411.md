ποις ἀβάτοις, ἀλλὰ καὶ θηρίοις καὶ πετεινοῖς εἰς τὸν ἅπαντα χρό-
νον αἴσχιστος κατασταθήσεται. τὰ δὲ ἀντίγραφα τῆς γραφῆς ἐκ-
τιθέσθω ὀφθαλμοφανῶς ἐν πάσῃ τῇ βασιλεία, ἑτοίμους δὲ εἶναι
πάντας τοὺς Ἰουδαίους εἰς ταύτην τὴν ἡμέραν, πολεμῆσαι αὐ-
τῶν τοὺς ὑπεναντίους.

ΚΕΦ. Θʹ. ΙΧ.

Οἱ μὲν οὖν ἱππεῖς ἐξῆλθον σπεύδοντες τὰ ὑπὸ τοῦ βασιλέως
λεγόμενα ἐπιτελεῖν· ἐξετέθη δὲ τὸ ἔκθεμα καὶ ἐν Σούσοις. Ὁ δὲ 15
Μαρδοχαῖος ἐξῆλθεν ἐστολισμένος τὴν βασιλικὴν στολήν, καὶ στέ-
φανον ἔχων χρυσοῦν, καὶ διάδημα βύσσινον πορφυροῦν· ἰδόντες 16
δὲ οἱ ἐν Σούσοις ἐχάρησαν, ὅτι τοῖς Ἰουδαίοις ἐγένετο φῶς καὶ εὐ-
φροσύνη, κατὰ πόλιν καὶ χώραν, οὗ ἐὰν ἐξετέθη τὸ ἔκθεμα χαρὰ 17
καὶ εὐφροσύνη τοῖς Ἰουδαίοις, κῶμος καὶ εὐφροσύνη· καὶ πολλοὶ
τῶν ἐθνῶν περιετέμοντο, καὶ Ἰουδαΐζον διὰ τὸν φόβον τῶν Ἰου-
δαίων. Ἐν γὰρ τῷ δωδεκάτῳ μηνὶ τῇ τρισκαιδεκάτῃ τοῦ μηνὸς, 1
ὅς ἐστιν Ἀδὰρ, παρῆν τὰ γράμματα τὰ γραφέντα ὑπὸ τοῦ βασι-
λέως· ἐν αὐτῇ τῇ ἡμέρα ἀπώλοντο οἱ ἀντικείμενοι τοῖς Ἰουδαίοις· 2
οὐδεὶς γὰρ ἀντέστη, φοβούμενος αὐτούς. Οἱ γὰρ ἄρχοντες τῶν σα- 3
τραπῶν, καὶ οἱ τύραννοι, καὶ οἱ βασιλικοὶ γραμματεῖς, ἐτίμων
τοὺς Ἰουδαίους· ὁ γὰρ φόβος Μαρδοχαίου ἐνέκειτο αὐτοῖς. Προσ- 4
έπεσε γὰρ τὸ πρόσταγμα τοῦ βασιλέως ὀνομασθῆναι ἐν πάσῃ τῇ
βασιλεία. Καὶ ἐν Σούσοις τῇ πόλει ἀπέκτειναν οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι ἄνδρας 6
πεντακοσίους, τόν τε Φαρσανεστάν καὶ Δελφῶν, καὶ Φασγά, καὶ 7.8
Βαρδαβὰ, καὶ Βαρέλ, καὶ Σαρβαχὰ, καὶ Μαρμασιμνὰ, καὶ Ῥου- 9
φανὸν, καὶ Ἀρσαῖον, καὶ Ζαβουγαθὰ, τοὺς δέκα υἱοὺς Ἀμὰν Ἁμα- 10
δαθοῦ τοῦ Βουγαίου τοῦ ἐχθροῦ τῶν Ἰουδαίων ἀπέκτειναν, καὶ
διήρπασαν ἐν αὐτῇ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ· ἐπεδόθη ἀριθμὸς τῷ βασιλεῖ τῶν 11
ἀπολωλότων ἐν Σούσοις. Εἶπε δὲ ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἐσθὴρ· ἀπώλεσαν 12
οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι ἐν Σούσοις τῇ πόλει ἄνδρας πεντακοσίους, ἐν δὲ τῇ
περιχώρῳ πῶς οἴει κέχρηνται; καὶ τί ἀξιοῖς ἔτι, καὶ ἔσται σοι;
Καὶ εἶπεν Ἐσθὴρ τῷ βασιλεῖ· δοθήτω τοῖς Ἰουδαίοις χρῆσθαι 13
ὡσαύτως τὴν αὔριον, ὥστε τοὺς δέκα υἱοὺς Ἀμὰν κρεμάσαι. Καὶ 14
ἐπέτρεψεν οὕτως γενέσθαι, καὶ ἐξέθηκε τοῖς Ἰουδαίοις τῆς πό-
λεως τὰ σώματα τῶν υἱῶν Ἀμὰν κρεμάσαι. Καὶ συνήχθησαν οἱ 15

**Chapter 8**

...[not only] for men to pass, but also for beasts and for birds, it shall be made a most ignominious [place] for all time. And let the copies of this writing be displayed plainly before [all] eyes in every part of the kingdom, and let all the Jews be ready on that day to make war upon their adversaries.

**Chapter 9**

<sup>15</sup> Now the horsemen went forth, hastening to execute the things commanded by the king; and the decree was displayed also in Susa. <sup>16</sup> And Mordecai went forth, attired in royal apparel, having a golden crown, and a diadem of fine linen and purple; <sup>17</sup> and when those in Susa saw him, they rejoiced, for unto the Jews was there light and gladness. And in every city and country where the decree was displayed, there was joy and gladness unto the Jews, even a revelry and gladness. And many of the peoples of the nations did circumcise themselves and Judaize, because of the fear of the Jews.

<sup>1</sup> For in the twelfth month, on the thirteenth day of the month, which is Adar, the letters written by the king did arrive; <sup>2</sup> and on that very day did those who were adversaries unto the Jews perish; for no man stood against them, for they feared them greatly. <sup>3</sup> For the princes of the satraps, and the tyrants, and the royal scribes, did honor the Jews; <sup>4</sup> for the fear of Mordecai was laid upon them. For the king's commandment had gone forth to be proclaimed throughout all the kingdom.

<sup>6</sup> And in the city of Susa did the Jews slay five hundred men: <sup>7</sup> even Parsandatha, and Dalphon, and Fasga, <sup>8</sup> and Bardaba, and Barel, and Sarbacha, <sup>9</sup> and Marmasimna, and Ruphanos, and Arsaeus, and Zabougatha— <sup>10</sup> these ten sons of Haman, the son of Hammedatha, the Bougaios, the enemy of the Jews, did they slay and plunder on that day. <sup>11</sup> And the number of those destroyed in Susa was reported unto the king. <sup>12</sup> Then said the king unto Esther: "In the city of Susa have the Jews destroyed five hundred men; but in the surrounding region, how thinkest thou have they fared? And what more dost thou desire, and it shall be granted unto thee?"

<sup>13</sup> And Esther said unto the king: "Let it be granted unto the Jews to act likewise tomorrow, that they may hang the ten sons of Haman." <sup>14</sup> And he permitted that it should be so done; and he set forth for the Jews of the city the bodies of Haman's sons to hang. <sup>15</sup> And the Jews were gathered...
