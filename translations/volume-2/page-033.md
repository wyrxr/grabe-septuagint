ΚΕΦ. ΙΕ΄. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Α΄. 509
θεματιεῖς αὐτὸν καὶ πάντα τὰ αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐ φείσῃ ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ·
καὶ ἀποκτενεῖς ἀπὸ ἀνδρὸς καὶ ἕως γυναικός, καὶ ἀπὸ νηπίου ἕως
θηλάζοντος, καὶ ἀπὸ μόσχου ἕως προβάτου, καὶ ἀπὸ καμήλου
ἕως ὄνου. Καὶ παρήγγειλε Σαοὺλ τῷ λαῷ, καὶ ἐπισκέπτεται 4
αὐτοὺς ἐν Γαλγάλοις διακοσίας χιλιάδας ταγμάτων, καὶ δέκα χι-
λιάδας ταγμάτων Ἰούδα. Καὶ ἦλθε Σαοὺλ ἕως τῶν πόλεων Ἀ- 5
μαλήκ, καὶ ἐνήδρευσεν ἐν τῷ χειμάῤῥῳ. Καὶ εἶπε Σαοὺλ πρὸς 6
τὸν Κιναῖον· Ἄπελθε καὶ ἔκκλινον ἐκ μέσου τοῦ Ἀμαληκίτου, μὴ
προσθῶ σε μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ σὺ ἐποίησας ἔλεος μετὰ πάντων τῶν
υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τῷ ἀναβαίνειν αὐτοὺς ἐξ Αἰγύπτου. Καὶ ἐξέκλι-
νεν ὁ Κιναῖος ἐκ μέσου Ἀμαλήκ. Καὶ ἐπάταξε Σαοὺλ τὸν Ἀ- 7
μαλὴκ ἀπὸ Εὐιλὰ ἕως Σοὺρ ἢ ἐπὶ προσώπου Αἰγύπτου. Καὶ συνέ- 8
λαβε τὸν Ἀγὰγ βασιλέα Ἀμαλὴκ ζῶντα, καὶ πάντα τὸν λαὸν
(ἐξωλόθρευσεν) Ἱερεὶμ ἀπέκτεινεν ἐν στόματι ῥομφαίας. Καὶ πε- 9
ριεποιήσατο Σαοὺλ καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς τὸν Ἀγὰγ ζῶντα, καὶ τὰ ἀ-
γαθὰ τῶν ποιμνίων, καὶ τῶν βουκολίων, καὶ τῶν ἐδεσμάτων, καὶ
τῶν ἀμπελώνων, καὶ πάντων τῶν ἀγαθῶν, καὶ οὐκ ἐβούλοντο ἐξ-
ολοθρεῦσαι αὐτά· καὶ πᾶν ἔργον ἠτιμωμένον καὶ ἐξουδενωμένον
ἐξωλόθρευσαν. Καὶ ἐγενήθη ῥῆμα Κυρίου πρὸς Σαμουήλ, λέγων· 10
παρακέκλημαι ὅτι ἐβασίλευσα τὸν Σαοὺλ εἰς βασιλέα, ὅτι ἀπέστρε- 11
ψεν ἀπὸ ὀπισθέν μου, καὶ τοὺς λόγους μου οὐκ ἔστησε. Καὶ ἠθύ-
μησε Σαμουήλ, καὶ ἐβόησε πρὸς Κύριον ὅλην τὴν νύκτα. Καὶ 12
ὤρθρισε Σαμουήλ, καὶ ἐπορεύθη εἰς ἀπάντησιν τῷ Ἰσραὴλ τὸ πρωΐ.
Καὶ ἀπηγγέλη τῷ Σαμουήλ, λέγοντες· Ἥκει Σαοὺλ εἰς Κάρμηλον,
καὶ ἰδοὺ ἀνέσακεν αὑτῷ χεῖρα. Καὶ ἐπέστρεψε τὸ ἅρμα, καὶ κα-
τέβη εἰς Γάλγαλα. Καὶ ἦλθε Σαμουὴλ πρὸς Σαούλ, καὶ ἰδοὺ 13
αὐτὸς ἀνέφερεν ὁλοκαύτωσιν τῷ Κυρίῳ, τὰ πρῶτα τῶν σκύλων
ὧν ἤνεγκεν ἐξ Ἀμαλήκ· καὶ παρεγένετο Σαμουὴλ πρὸς Σαούλ,
καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Σαούλ· εὐλογητὸς σὺ τῷ Κυρίῳ· ἔστησα πάντα
ὅσα ἐλάλησε Κύριος. Καὶ εἶπε Σαμουήλ· καὶ τίς ἡ φωνὴ τοῦ 14
ποιμνίου αὕτη ἐν τοῖς ὠσί μου, καὶ φωνὴ τῶν βοῶν ὧν ἐγὼ ἀ-
κούω; Καὶ εἶπε Σαούλ· ἐξ Ἀμαλὴκ ἤνεγκα αὐτά, ἃ περιεποι- 15
ήσατο ὁ λαὸς τὰ κράτιστα τοῦ ποιμνίου, καὶ τῶν βοῶν, ὅπως θυ-
θῇ Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ σου, καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ ἐξωλόθρευσα. Καὶ εἶπε 16
Σαμουήλ πρὸς Σαούλ· Ἄνες, καὶ ἀπαγγελῶ σοι ἃ ἐλάλησε Κύρι-
ος πρός με τὴν νύκτα. Καὶ εἶπεν αὑτῷ· Λάλησον· καὶ εἶπε 17

**1 Samuel 15**

...utterly curse him and all that pertaineth unto him, and spare him not; but thou shalt slay from man unto woman, and from infant unto suckling, and from calf unto sheep, and from camel unto ass.
4 And Saul commanded the people, and he reviewed them in Gilgal, two hundred thousand battalions, and ten thousand battalions of Judah.
5 And Saul came unto the cities of Amalek, and lay in wait in the wadi.
6 And Saul said unto the Kenite, "Depart, and withdraw thyself from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy thee with him; for thou didst show mercy with all the children of Israel when they came up out of Egypt."
7 And the Kenite departed from among Amalek. And Saul smote Amalek from Havilah unto Shur, or upon the face of Egypt.
8 And he took Agag, the king of Amalek, alive, and all the people (he utterly destroyed); and Jeremy he slew with the edge of the sword.
9 But Saul and all the people spared Agag alive, and the best of the flocks, and of the herds, and of the provisions, and of the vineyards, and all the good things; and they would not utterly destroy them. But every despised thing and every worthless thing, they utterly destroyed.
10 Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying,
11 "I regret that I have made Saul king; for he hath turned back from following Me, and hath not performed My words." And Samuel was grieved, and he cried unto the LORD all night.
12 And Samuel rose early in the morning to meet Israel. And it was told Samuel, saying, "Saul is come to Carmel, and behold, he hath raised up for himself a hand." And he turned back the chariot, and went down to Gilgal.
13 And Samuel came unto Saul; and behold, he was offering up a burnt offering unto the LORD, the firstfruits of the spoil which he brought from Amalek. And Samuel came to Saul, and Saul said unto him, "Blessed art thou of the LORD; I have performed all that the LORD spake."
14 And Samuel said, "What then is this voice of the flock in mine ears, and the voice of the oxen which I hear?"
15 And Saul said, "From Amalek have I brought them, which the people spared—the choicest of the flock and of the oxen—that they might be sacrificed unto the LORD thy God; and the rest I utterly destroyed."
16 And Samuel said unto Saul, "Stay now, and I will declare unto thee what the LORD spake unto me this night." And he said unto him, "Speak."
17 And he said...
