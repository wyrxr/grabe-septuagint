### 2 Kings 13

**20** συντελείας, καὶ νῦν τρὶς πατάξεις τὴν Συρίαν. Καὶ ἀπέθανεν Ἐλισσαῖ, καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτόν. καὶ μονόζωνοι Μωὰβ ἦλθον ἐν τῇ γῇ
**21** ἐλθόντος τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ. Καὶ ἐγένετο αὐτῶν θαπτόντων τὸν ἄνδρα, καὶ ἰδοὺ εἶδον τὸν μονόζωνον, καὶ ἐῤῥιψαν τὸν ἄνδρα ἐν τῷ τάφῳ Ἐλισσαίε· καὶ ἐπορεύθη, καὶ ἥψατο τῶν ὀστέων Ἐλισσαίε, καὶ ἔζησε, καὶ ἀνέστη ἐπὶ τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ.
**22** Καὶ Ἀζαὴλ βασιλεὺς Συρίας ἐξέθλιψε τὸν Ἰσραὴλ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας Ἰωάχαζ.
**23** Καὶ ἠλέησε Κύριος αὐτούς, καὶ οἰκτείρησεν αὐτούς, καὶ ἐπέβλεψεν πρὸς αὐτοὺς διὰ τὴν διαθήκην αὐτοῦ τὴν μετὰ Ἀβραάμ, καὶ Ἰσαάκ, καὶ Ἰακώβ, καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησε Κύριος διαφθεῖραι αὐτούς, καὶ οὐκ ἀπέρριψεν αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ τοῦ προσώπου αὐτοῦ.
**24** Καὶ ἀπέθανεν Ἀζαὴλ βασιλεὺς Συρίας, καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Ἄδερ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ.
**25** Καὶ ἀπέστρεψεν Ἰωὰς υἱὸς Ἰωάχαζ, καὶ ἔλαβε τὰς πόλεις ἐκ χειρὸς υἱοῦ Ἄδερ υἱοῦ Ἀζαὴλ, ἃς ἔλαβεν ἐκ χειρὸς Ἰωάχαζ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ. τρὶς ἐπάταξεν αὐτὸν Ἰωὰς, καὶ ἐπέστρεψε τὰς πόλεις Ἰσραήλ.

### 2 Kings 14

**1** ἘΝ ἔτει δευτέρῳ τῷ Ἰωὰς υἱῷ Ἰωάχαζ βασιλεῖ Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Ἀμασίας υἱὸς Ἰωὰς, βασιλεὺς Ἰούδα.
**2** Υἱὸς εἴκοσι καὶ πέντε ἐτῶν ἦν ἐν τῷ βασιλεύειν αὐτὸν, καὶ εἴκοσι καὶ ἐννέα ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ, καὶ ὄνομα τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ Ἰωαδεὶν ἐξ Ἱερουσαλήμ.
**3** Καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ εὐθὲς ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς Κυρίου, πλὴν οὐχ ὡς Δαυὶδ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ. Κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν Ἰωὰς ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ ἐποίησε.
**4** Πλὴν τὰ ὑψηλὰ οὐκ ἐξῆρεν· ἔτι ὁ λαὸς ἐθυσίαζε, καὶ ἐθυμίμων ἐν τοῖς ὑψηλοῖς.
**5** Καὶ ἐγένετο ὅτε κατίσχυσεν ἡ βασιλεία ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπάταξε τοὺς δούλους αὐτοῦ τοὺς πατάξαντας τὸν βασιλέα, τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ.
**6** Καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς τῶν παταξάντων οὐκ ἐθανάτωσε, καθὼς γέγραπται ἐν βίβλῳ νόμων Μωσῇ, ὡς ἐνετείλατο Κύριος, λέγων· οὐκ ἀποθανοῦνται πατέρες ὑπὲρ υἱῶν, καὶ υἱοὶ οὐκ ἀποθανοῦνται ὑπὲρ πατέρων· ὅτι ἀλλ᾿ ἕκαστος ἐν ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις αὐτοῦ ἀποθανεῖται.
**7** Αὐτὸς ἐπάταξε τὸν Ἐδὼμ ἐν Γεμελὰ δέκα χιλιάδας, καὶ συνέλαβε τὴν πέτραν ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ, καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτῆς Ἰεχθιὴλ ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης.
**8** Τότε ἀπέστειλεν Ἀμασίας ἀγγέλους πρὸς

### 2 Kings 13

**20** [their] utter destruction. And now, but thrice shalt thou smite Syria." Then Elisha died, and they buried him. And the Moabite raiders came into the land,
**21** at the coming in of the year. And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied the raider, and they cast the man into the tomb of Elisha; and he went, and touched the bones of Elisha, and revived, and stood up upon his feet.
**22** And Hazael, the king of Syria, oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.
**23** But the LORD had mercy upon them, and had compassion on them, and looked upon them because of His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob, and the LORD would not destroy them, neither did He cast them away from His presence.
**24** And Hazael, the king of Syria, died; and Ader his son reigned in his stead.
**25** And Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, turned again and took the cities out of the hand of the son of Ader, the son of Hazael, which he had taken from the hand of Jehoahaz his father in the war. Thrice did Joash smite him, and recovered the cities of Israel.

### 2 Kings 14

**1** In the second year of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel, began Amaziah, the son of Joash, king of Judah, to reign.
**2** He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem; and the name of his mother was Jehoaddin, of Jerusalem.
**3** And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, yet not as David his father. According to all that Joash his father did, so did he.
**4** Nevertheless, the high places did he not take away; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.
**5** And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his hand, that he slew his servants who had smitten the king, his father.
**6** But the children of those who smote him did he not slay, according as it is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, as the LORD commanded, saying, "The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers; but every man shall die for his own sin."
**7** He it was who smote Edom in the Valley of Salt, ten thousand, and captured the Rock in the war, and called the name of it Joktheel, unto this day.
**8** Then Amaziah sent messengers unto
