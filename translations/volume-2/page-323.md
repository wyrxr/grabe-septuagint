ΚΕΦ. ΚΑ΄. ΚΒ΄. ΤΩΝ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ ΙΟΥΔΑ Β΄. 799
τὴν ἀποσκευὴν ἣν εὗρον ἐν οἴκῳ τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐ κατελείφθη αὐτῷ υἱός, ἀλλ’
ἢ ᾿Οχοζίας ὁ μικρότατος τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα πάν- 18
τα ἐπάταξεν αὐτὸν Κύριος εἰς τὴν κοιλίαν μαλακίαν ἐν ᾗ οὐκ ἔστιν
ἰατρεία, καὶ ἐγένετο ἐκ ἡμερῶν εἰς ἡμέρας. καὶ ὡς ἦλθεν ὁ και- 19
ρὸς τῶν ἡμερῶν, ἡμέρας δύο, ἐξῆλθεν ἡ κοιλία αὐτοῦ μετὰ τῆς
νόσου, καὶ ἀπέθανεν ἐν μαλακίᾳ πονηρᾷ. Καὶ οὐκ ἐποίησεν ὁ λαὸς
αὐτοῦ ἐκφοράν, καθὼς ἐκφορὰν πατέρων αὐτοῦ. Ἦν τριάκοντα 20
καὶ δύο ἐτῶν ὅτε ἐβασίλευσε, καὶ ὀκτὼ ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν εἰς Ἱε-
ρουσαλήμ· καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἐν οὐκ ἐπαίνῳ, καὶ ἐτάφη ἐν πόλει Δαυΐδ,
καὶ οὐκ ἐν τάφοις τῶν βασιλέων.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΒ΄. XXII.

ΚΑΙ ἐβασίλευσαν οἱ κατοικοῦντες ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ τὸν ᾿Οχο- 1
ζίαν τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ τὸν μικρὸν ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ, ὅτι πάντας τοὺς πρεσ-
βυτέρους ἀπέκτεινε τὸ λῃστήριον τὸ ἐπελθὸν ἐπ᾿ αὐτούς, οἱ Ἄρα-
βες, καὶ οἱ Ἀλιμαζονεῖς. Καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν ᾿Οχοζίας υἱὸς Ἰωρὰμ
βασιλέως Ἰούδα. Ὤν εἴκοσι ἐτῶν ἐβασίλευσεν ᾿Οχοζίας, καὶ ἕνα 2
ἐνιαυτὸν ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ὄνομα τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ
Γοθολία θυγάτηρ Ἀμβρί. Καὶ οὗτος ἐπορεύθη ἐν ὁδῷ οἴκου Ἀ- 3
χαάβ, ὅτι μήτηρ αὐτοῦ ἦν σύμβουλος τοῦ ἁμαρτάνειν. Καὶ ἐποίη- 4
σε τὸ πονηρὸν ἐναντίον Κυρίου ὡς ὁ οἶκος Ἀχαάβ, ὅτι αὐτοὶ ἦ-
σαν αὐτῷ, μετὰ τὸ ἀποθανεῖν τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ, σύμβουλοι τοῦ
ἐξολεθρεῦσαι αὐτόν, καὶ ἐν ταῖς βουλαῖς αὐτῶν ἐπορεύθη. Καὶ 5
ἐπορεύθη μετὰ Ἰωρὰμ υἱοῦ Ἀχαὰβ βασιλέως Ἰσραὴλ εἰς πόλεμον
ἐπὶ Ἀζαὴλ βασιλέα Συρίας εἰς Ραμὼθ Γαλαάδ. Καὶ ἐπάταξαν οἱ
τοξόται τὸν Ἰωράμ· καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν Ἰωρὰμ τοῦ ἰατρευθῆναι εἰς 6
Ἰεζραὲλ ἀπὸ τῶν πληγῶν, ὧν ἐπάταξαν αὐτὸν οἱ Σύροι ἐν Ῥα-
μὰ ἐν τῷ πολεμεῖν αὐτὸν πρὸς Ἀζαὴλ βασιλέα Συρίας. Καὶ ᾿Οχο-
ζίας υἱὸς Ἰωρὰμ βασιλεὺς Ἰούδα κατέβη θεάσασθαι τὸν Ἰωρὰμ
υἱὸν Ἀχαὰβ εἰς Ἰεζραέλ, ὅτι ἠῤῥώστει. Καὶ παρὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐγέ- 7
νετο καταστροφὴ ᾿Οχοζία ἐλθεῖν πρὸς Ἰωράμ· καὶ ἐν τῷ ἐλθεῖν
αὐτόν, ἐξῆλθε μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ Ἰωρὰμ πρὸς Ἰηοῦ υἱὸν Ναμεσσί χρι-
στὸν Κυρίου εἰς τὸν οἶκον Ἀχαάβ. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἐξεδίκησεν 8
Ἰηοῦ τὸν οἶκον Ἀχαάβ, καὶ εὗρε τοὺς ἄρχοντας Ἰούδα, καὶ τοὺς

### CHAPTER XXI

¹⁷ ...all the substance which they found in the king’s house, and his sons, and his daughters; so that there was not left to him a son, save only Ahaziah, the youngest of his sons.

¹⁸ And after all these things, the Lord smote him in his bowels with a grievous sickness, for which there was no healing; and it came to pass from day to day.

¹⁹ And when the time of the days came, [even] two days, his bowels came forth by reason of his sickness, and he died of a grievous malady. And his people made no funeral solemnity for him, as the funeral solemnity of his fathers.

²⁰ He was thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem; and he departed without honor, and was buried in the city of David, but not in the sepulchers of the kings.

### CHAPTER XXII

¹ And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, his youngest son, king in his stead; for the band of robbers that came upon them, [even] the Arabians and the Alimazoneis, had slain all the elder [sons]. So Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, reigned.

² Ahaziah was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Gotholia, the daughter of Ambri.

³ And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, for his mother was his counselor to do wickedly.

⁴ And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, even as the house of Ahab did; for they were his counselors after the death of his father, to destroy him, and in their counsels he walked.

⁵ He walked also with Jehoram, the son of Ahab king of Israel, to war against Hazael king of Syria, at Ramoth Gilead: and the archers smote Jehoram.

⁶ And Jehoram returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, went down to see Jehoram, the son of Ahab, in Jezreel, because he was sick.

⁷ Now the downfall of Ahaziah, that he should come to Jehoram, was of God: for when he was come, Jehoram went out with him to Jehu, the son of Namessi, the anointed of the Lord, unto the house of Ahab.

⁸ And it came to pass, when Jehu executed judgment upon the house of Ahab, that he found the princes of Judah, and the...
