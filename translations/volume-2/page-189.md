ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Δ΄. 665
ΚΕΦ. Δ΄. IV.

**1** ΚΑΙ γυνὴ μία ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν τῶν προφητῶν ἐβόησε πρὸς Ἐλισσαιέ,
λέγουσα· ὁ δοῦλός σου ὁ ἀνήρ μου ἀπέθανε, καὶ σὺ ἔγνως,
ὅτι δοῦλός σου ἦν φοβούμενος τὸν Κύριον· καὶ ὁ δανειστὴς (μου)
ἦλθε λαβεῖν τοὺς δύο υἱούς μου αὐτῷ εἰς δούλους.
**2** Καὶ εἶπεν Ἐλισσαιὲ πρὸς αὐτήν· τί ποιήσω σοι; ἀνάγγειλόν μοι τί ἔστι σοι
ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ; ἡ δὲ εἶπεν· οὐκ ἔστι τῇ δούλῃ σου οὐδὲν ἐν τῷ
οἴκῳ, ἀλλ’ ἢ ἃ ἀλείφομαι ἔλαιον.
**3** Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτήν· δεῦρο, αἴτησον
σεαυτῇ σκεύη ἔξωθεν παρὰ πάντων τῶν γειτόνων σου, σκεύη
κενά· μὴ ὀλιγώσῃς.
**4** Καὶ εἰσελεύσῃ, καὶ ἀποκλείσεις τὴν θύραν κατ’
τὰ σοῦ, καὶ κατὰ τῶν υἱῶν σου, καὶ ἀποχεεῖς εἰς πάντα τὰ σκεύη
ταῦτα, καὶ τὸ πληρωθὲν ἀρεῖς.
**5** Καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀπέκλεισε
τὴν θύραν καθ’ αὐτῆς, καὶ κατὰ τῶν υἱῶν ἑαυτῆς· αὐτοὶ
προσήγγιζον πρὸς αὐτήν, καὶ αὐτὴ ἐπέχεεν ἕως ἐπληρώθησαν τὰ
σκεύη.
**6** Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτῆς· ἐγγίσατε ἔτι πρὸς με
σκεῦος· καὶ εἶπον αὐτῇ· οὐκ ἔστιν ἔτι σκεῦος. καὶ ἔστη τὸ ἔλαιον.
**7** Καὶ ἀνέστη καὶ ἀπήγγειλε τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ τοῦ Θεοῦ. καὶ εἶπεν Ἐλισσαιέ·
δεῦρο, καὶ ἀπόδου τὸ ἔλαιον, καὶ ἀποτίσεις τοὺς τόκους σου,
καὶ σὺ καὶ υἱοί σου ζήσεσθε ἐν τῷ ὑπολοίπῳ ἐλαίῳ.
**8** Καὶ ἐγένετο
ἡμέρα, καὶ διέβη Ἐλισσαιὲ εἰς Σωνάμ, καὶ ἐκεῖ γυνὴ μεγάλη, καὶ
ἐκράτησεν αὐτὸν φαγεῖν ἄρτον. καὶ ἐγένετο ἀφ᾽ ἱκανοῦ τοῦ εἰσπο-
ρεύεσθαι αὐτόν, ἐξέκλινε τοῦ φαγεῖν.
**9** Καὶ εἶπεν ἡ γυνὴ πρὸς τὸν
ἄνδρα αὐτῆς· ἰδοὺ δὴ ἔγνωκα ὅτι ἄνθρωπος τοῦ Θεοῦ ἅγιος οὗτος
διαπορεύεται ἐφ’ ἡμᾶς διὰ παντός.
**10** Ποιήσωμεν δὴ αὐτῷ ὑπερῶον,
τόπον μικρόν, καὶ θῶμεν αὐτῷ ἐκεῖ κλίνην, καὶ τράπεζαν, καὶ δίφρον,
καὶ λυχνίαν· καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῷ εἰσπορεύεσθαι πρὸς ἡμᾶς, καὶ
ἐκκλινεῖ ἐκεῖ.
**11** Καὶ ἐγένετο ἡμέρα καὶ εἰσῆλθεν ἐκεῖ, καὶ ἐξέκλινεν
εἰς τὸ ὑπερῶον, καὶ ἐκοιμήθη ἐκεῖ.
**12** Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς Γιεζεὶ τὸ παιδάριον
αὐτοῦ· κάλεσόν μοι τὴν Σουναμίτιν ταύτην. καὶ ἐκάλεσεν αὐτήν,
καὶ ἔστη ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ.
**13** Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· εἶπον δὴ πρὸς αὐτήν·
ἰδοὺ ἐξέστησας ἡμῖν πᾶσαν τὴν ἔκστασιν ταύτην, τί δεῖ ποιῆσαί
σοι? εἰ ἔστι λόγος σοι πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα, ἢ πρὸς τὸν ἄρχοντα
τῆς δυνάμεως; ἡ δὲ εἶπεν· ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ λαοῦ μου εἰμὶ ἐγὼ οἰκῶ.
**14** Καὶ εἶπε, τί δεῖ ποιῆσαι αὐτῇ; καὶ εἶπε Γιεζεὶ τὸ παιδάριον αὐ-

**The Fourth Book of the Kings. Chapter Four.**

**1** NOW a certain woman, of the wives of the sons of the prophets, cried out unto Elisha, saying, "Thy servant, my husband, is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant was one who feared the Lord. And the creditor [of mine] is come to take unto him my two sons as bondmen."

**2** Then Elisha said unto her, "What shall I do for thee? Declare unto me what thou hast in the house." And she answered, "Thy handmaid hath nought in the house, save for the oil wherewith I anoint myself."

**3** And he said unto her, "Go, ask thee vessels from without, from all thy neighbours, even empty vessels; be not sparing [of them]."

**4** And thou shalt go in, and shut the door [upon] thy matters, and upon thy sons; and thou shalt pour out into all these vessels, and take up that which is filled."

**5** So she departed from him, and shut the door upon herself, and upon her sons; and they brought [the vessels] near unto her, and she poured out until the vessels were filled.

**6** And she said unto her sons, "Bring yet another vessel nigh unto me." And they said unto her, "There is not yet another vessel." And the oil ceased.

**7** And she arose, and told the man of God. And Elisha said, "Go, and sell the oil, and pay thy debts; and thou, and thy sons, shall live upon the rest of the oil."

**8** And it came to pass on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, and there was a great woman, who constrained him to eat bread. And it came to pass after a long while that he came thither, that he turned aside to eat.

**9** And the woman said unto her husband, "Behold now, I perceive that this man, who passeth by us continually, is a holy man of God.

**10** Let us make for him now a little upper chamber, and set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick; and it shall be, when he cometh unto us, that he shall turn aside thither."

**11** And it came to pass on a day, that he came thither, and turned aside into the upper chamber, and lay down there.

**12** And he said unto Gehazi, his servant, "Call me this Shunammite woman." And he called her, and she stood before him.

**13** And he said unto him, "Say now unto her, 'Behold, thou hast bestowed upon us all this diligence; what is to be done for thee? Hast thou a word for the king, or for the captain of the host?'" And she answered, "I dwell among mine own people."

**14** And he said, "What then is to be done for her?" And Gehazi, his servant, said,
