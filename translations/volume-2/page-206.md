ΚΕΦ. Ι΄. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Δ΄. 682
32 Ἱεροβοὰμ δὲ ἐξήμαρτε τὸν Ἰσραήλ. Ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις ἤρξατο Κύριος συγκόπτειν ἐν παντὶ ὁρίῳ Ἰσραήλ. καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐ-
33 τοὺς Ἀζαὴλ ἐν παντὶ ὁρίῳ Ἰσραήλ, ἀπὸ τοῦ Ἰορδάνου κατ᾽ ἀνατολὰς ἡλίου πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν Γαλαὰδ τοῦ Γαδδεί, καὶ τοῦ Ῥουβήν, καὶ τοῦ Μανασσῆ, ἀπὸ Ἀροὴρ ἥ ἐστιν ἐπὶ τοῦ χείλους τοῦ χει-
34 μάρρου Ἀρνῶν, καὶ τὴν Γαλαάδ, καὶ τὴν Βασάν. Καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Ἰηοῦ, καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησε, καὶ πᾶσα ἡ δυναστεία αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰς συνάψεις ἃς συνῆψεν, οὐκ ἰδοὺ ταῦτα γεγραμμένα ἐπὶ βιβλίου λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν Ἰσραήλ;
35 Καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Ἰηοῦ μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ˙ καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ˙ καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Ἰωάχαζ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀντ᾽ αὐτοῦ.
36 Καὶ αἱ ἡμέραι ἃς ἐβασίλευσεν Ἰηοῦ ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ, εἰκοσιοκτὼ ἔτη ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΑ΄.

1 ΚΑΙ Γοθολία ἡ μήτηρ Ὀχοζίου εἶδεν ὅτι ἀπέθανεν ὁ υἱὸς αὐτῆς, καὶ ἀπώλεσε πᾶν τὸ σπέρμα τῆς βασιλείας.
2 Καὶ ἔλαβεν Ἰωσαβεέ, θυγάτηρ τοῦ βασιλέως Ἰωράμ, ἀδελφὴ Ὀχοζίου, τὸν Ἰωὰς υἱὸν Ὀχοζίου, καὶ ἔκλεψεν αὐτὸν ἐκ μέσου τῶν υἱῶν τοῦ βασιλέως τῶν θανατουμένων, αὐτὸν καὶ τὴν τροφὸν αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ ταμείῳ τῶν κλινῶν, καὶ ἔκρυψεν αὐτὸν ἀπὸ προσώπου Γοθολίας, καὶ
3 οὐκ ἐθανατώθη. Καὶ ἦν μετ᾽ αὐτῆς ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου κρυβόμενος ἓξ ἔτη. Καὶ Γοθολία βασιλεύουσα ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς.
4 Καὶ ἐν ἔτει τῷ ἑβδόμῳ ἀπέστειλεν Ἰωαδαέ, καὶ ἔλαβε τοὺς ἑκατοντάρχους, τὸν Χορρεὶ, καὶ τὸν Ῥασεὶμ, καὶ ἀπήγαγεν αὐτοὺς πρὸς αὐτὸν εἰς οἶκον Κυρίου, καὶ διέθετο αὐτοῖς διαθήκην Κυρίου, καὶ ὤρκισεν αὐτοὺς ἐν τῇ διαθήκῃ Κυρίου˙ καὶ ἔδειξεν αὐτοῖς Ἰωαδαὲ τὸν υἱὸν τοῦ
5 βασιλέως, καὶ ἐνετείλατο αὐτοῖς, λέγων· οὗτος ὁ λόγος ὃν ποιήσετε˙ τὸ τρίτον ἐξ ὑμῶν εἰσελθέτω τὸ σάββατον, καὶ φυλάξατε φυλακὴν οἴκου τοῦ βασιλέως ἐν τῷ πυλῶνι,
6 καὶ τὸ τρίτον ἐν πύλῃ τῶν ὁδῶν, καὶ τὸ τρίτον τῆς πύλης ὀπίσω τῶν παρατρεχόντων, καὶ φυλάξατε τὴν φυλακὴν τοῦ οἴκου.
7 Καὶ δύο χεῖρες ἐν ὑμῖν, πᾶς ὁ ἐκπορευόμενος τὸ σάββατον, καὶ φυλάξουσι τὴν φυλακὴν οἴκου Κυρίου πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα.
8 Καὶ κυκλώσατε ἐπὶ τὸν βασιλέα κύκλῳ ἀνὴρ, καὶ τὸ σκεῦος αὐτοῦ ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὁ εἰσπορευόμενος εἰς τὰ Σαθηρὼθ, ἀποθανεῖται. Καὶ ἐγένοντο μετὰ

**32** But Jeroboam, he made Israel to sin. In those days the LORD began to cut off [portions] in all the border of Israel. And Azazel smote them in all the border of Israel,

**33** from the Jordan eastward, even all the land of Gilead, of the Gadites, and of the Reubenites, and of Manasseh, from Aroer, which is by the bank of the brook Arnon, and Gilead, and Bashan.

**34** Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, and his alliances which he made, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

**35** So Jehu slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.

**36** And the days which Jehu reigned over Israel were twenty and eight years in Samaria.

### Chapter 11

**1** Now when Athaliah, the mother of Ahaziah, saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal seed.

**2** But Jehosheba, the daughter of King Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons who were being put to death, even him and his nurse, in the chamber of beds; and they hid him from the face of Athaliah, so that he was not slain.

**3** And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD for six years. And Athaliah reigned over the land.

**4** And in the seventh year Jehoiada sent and took the captains, even Chorrhei and Raseim, and brought them unto him into the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them by the covenant of the LORD; and he showed them the king's son.

**5** And he commanded them, saying, "This is the thing that ye shall do: A third part of you that enter in on the Sabbath shall keep the watch of the king's house in the gate-house;

**6** and a third part at the gate of the ways; and a third part at the gate behind the runners; and ye shall keep the watch of the house.

**7** And two companies among you, even all those who go out on the Sabbath, shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD unto the king.

**8** And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapon in his hand; and whosoever cometh within the guarded enclosure shall die."
