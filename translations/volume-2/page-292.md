γυρίῳ, καὶ ἐν τῷ χαλκῷ, καὶ ἐν τῷ σιδήρῳ, καὶ ἐν τῇ πορφύρᾳ,
καὶ ἐν τῷ κοκκίνῳ, καὶ ἐν τῇ ὑακίνθῳ, καὶ ἐπιστάμενον τοῦ γλύ-
ψαι γλυφὴν μετὰ τῶν σοφῶν τῶν μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ ἐν ᾿Ιούδα καὶ ἐν ᾿Ιε-
⁸ ρουσαλήμ, ὧν ἡτοίμασε Δαυὶδ ὁ πατήρ μου. Καὶ ἀπόστειλόν μοι
ξύλα κέδρινα, καὶ ἀρκεύθινα, καὶ πεύκινα ἐκ τοῦ Λιβάνου, ὅτι ἐγὼ
οἶδα ὡς οἱ δοῦλοί σου οἴδασι κόπτειν ξύλα ἐκ τοῦ Λιβάνου· καὶ
⁹ ἰδοὺ οἱ παῖδές σου μετὰ τῶν παίδων μου, πορεύσονται ἑτοιμάσαι
μοι ξύλα εἰς πλῆθος, ὅτι ὁ οἶκος ὃν ἐγὼ οἰκοδομῶ μέγας, καὶ ἔν-
¹⁰ δοξος. Καὶ ἰδοὺ τοῖς ἐργαζομένοις, τοῖς κόπτουσι ξύλα, εἰς βρώ-
ματα δώδεκα σῖτον εἰς δόματα τοῖς παισί σου πυροῦ χόρων εἴκο-
σι χιλιάδας, καὶ κριθῶν χόρων εἴκοσι χιλιάδας, καὶ οἴνου μέτρων
¹¹ εἴκοσι χιλιάδας, καὶ ἐλαίου κάδων εἴκοσι χιλιάδας. Καὶ εἶπε Χει-
ρὰμ βασιλεὺς Τύρου ἐν γραφῇ, καὶ ἀπέστειλε πρὸς Σαλωμὼν ἐν
τῷ ἀγαπῆσαι Κύριον τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ, ἔδωκε σὲ ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς εἰς βα-
¹² σιλέα. Καὶ εἶπε Χειράμ· εὐλογητὸς Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ᾿Ισραήλ, ὃς
ἐποίησε τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ τὴν γῆν, ὃς ἔδωκε τῷ Δαυὶδ τῷ βασιλεῖ
υἱὸν σοφόν, καὶ ἐπιστάμενον ἐπιστήμην καὶ σύνεσιν, ὃς οἰκοδομήσει
¹³ οἶκον τῷ Κυρίῳ, καὶ οἶκον τῇ βασιλείᾳ ἑαυτοῦ· καὶ νῦν ἀπέσταλ-
κά σοι ἄνδρα σοφόν, καὶ εἰδότα σύνεσιν, τὸν Χειρὰμ τὸν παῖδά
¹⁴ μου, ἢ μήτηρ αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ θυγατέρων Δάν, καὶ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ ἀνὴρ
Τύριος, εἰδότα ποιῆσαι ἐν χρυσίῳ καὶ ἐν ἀργυρίῳ, καὶ ἐν χαλκῷ,
καὶ ἐν σιδήρῳ, καὶ ἐν λίβοις, καὶ ξύλοις, καὶ ὑφαίνειν ἐν τῇ πορ-
φύρᾳ, καὶ ἐν τῇ ὑακίνθῳ, καὶ ἐν τῇ βύσσῳ, καὶ ἐν τῷ κοκκίνῳ,
καὶ γλύψαι γλυφάς, καὶ διανοεῖσθαι πᾶσαν διανόησιν, ὅσα ἂν δῷς
αὐτῷ μετὰ τῶν σοφῶν σου, καὶ σοφῶν Δαυὶδ κυρίου μου τοῦ πα-
¹⁵ τρός σου. Καὶ νῦν τὸν σῖτον, καὶ τὴν κριθὴν, καὶ τὸ ἔλαιον, καὶ
τὸν οἶνον ὃν εἶπεν ὁ κύριός μου, ἀποστειλάτω τοῖς παισὶν αὐτοῦ.
¹⁶ Καὶ ἡμεῖς κόψομεν ξύλα ἐκ τοῦ Λιβάνου κατὰ πᾶσαν τὴν χρείαν
σου, καὶ ἄξομεν αὐτὰ σχεδίαις ἐπὶ θάλασσαν ᾿Ιόππης, καὶ σὺ ἄξεις
¹⁷ αὐτὰ εἰς ῾Ιερουσαλήμ. Καὶ συνήγαγε Σαλωμὼν πάντας τοὺς ἄν-
δρας τοὺς προσηλύτους τοὺς ἐν γῇ ᾿Ισραὴλ μετὰ τὸν ἀριθμὸν, ὃν
ἠρίθμησεν αὐτοὺς Δαυὶδ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ, καὶ εὑρέθησαν ἑκατὸν
¹⁸ πεντήκοντα χιλιάδες καὶ τρισχίλιοι καὶ ἑξακόσιοι. Καὶ ἐποίησεν
ἐξ αὐτῶν ἑβδομήκοντα χιλιάδας νωτοφόρων, καὶ ὀγδοήκοντα χι-
λιάδας λατόμων, καὶ τρισχιλίους ἑξακοσίους τοὺς ἐργοδιώκτας
ἐπὶ τὸν λαόν.

⁷ silver, and in bronze, and in iron, and in purple, and in scarlet, and in hyacinth; and one understanding how to engrave an engraving, with the wise men who are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father had prepared.
⁸ And send me cedar wood, and juniper wood, and pine wood from Lebanon, for I know that your servants know how to cut timber from Lebanon;
⁹ and behold, your servants shall be with my servants, to go and prepare for me timber in abundance, for the house which I build is great and glorious.
¹⁰ And behold, to those that labor, to those that cut timber, for food [shall be given] twelve [measures of] grain; and as gifts to your servants, twenty thousand choruses of wheat, and twenty thousand choruses of barley, and twenty thousand measures of wine, and twenty thousand measures of oil.
¹¹ And Hiram, king of Tyre, said in writing, and sent unto Solomon, "Because the Lord loves His people, He hath made you king over them."
¹² And Hiram said, "Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who made the heaven and the earth, who gave to David the king a wise son, and one knowing knowledge and understanding, who shall build a house for the Lord, and a house for his own kingdom;
¹³ and now have I sent unto you a wise man, and one knowing understanding, even Hiram my servant,
¹⁴ whose mother is of the daughters of Dan, and whose father was a man of Tyre; one knowing how to work in gold, and in silver, and in bronze, and in iron, and in libations, and in wood; and to weave in purple, and in hyacinth, and in fine linen, and in scarlet; and to engrave engravings, and to devise every design whatsoever you shall give unto him, with your wise men, and with the wise men of David my lord your father."
¹⁵ And now, the wheat, and the barley, and the oil, and the wine, which my lord has spoken of, let him send unto his servants.
¹⁶ And we will cut timber from Lebanon according to all your need, and we will bring them in floats by sea to Joppa; and you shall bring them up to Jerusalem.
¹⁷ And Solomon gathered all the men who were strangers in the land of Israel, according to the numbering with which David his father had numbered them; and they were found to be one hundred and fifty thousand, and three thousand, and six hundred.
¹⁸ And he made from among them seventy thousand bearers of burdens, and eighty thousand quarrymen, and three thousand six hundred as overseers over the people.
