    ΚΕΦ. ΚΒʹ. ΚΓʹ. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΝ ΙΟΥΔΑ Αʹ. 753
    Σαλωμὼν υἱῷ αὐτοῦ. Οὐχὶ Κύριος μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν; καὶ ἀνέπαυσεν 18
    ὑμᾶς κυκλόθεν, ὅτι ἔδωκεν ἐν χειρί μου τοὺς κατοικοῦντας τὴν
    γῆν, καὶ ὑπετάγη ἡ γῆ ἐναντίον Κυρίου, καὶ ἐναντίον τοῦ λαοῦ
    αὐτοῦ. Νῦν δότε καρδίας ὑμῶν καὶ ψυχὰς ὑμῶν τοῦ ζητῆσαι τῷ 19
    Κυρίῳ Θεῷ ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐγέρθητε, καὶ οἰκοδομήσατε ἁγίασμα Κυ-
    ρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ ὑμῶν, τοῦ εἰσενέγκαι τὴν κιβωτὸν διαθήκης Κυρίου,
    καὶ σκεύη τὰ ἅγια τοῦ Θεοῦ εἰς οἶκον τὸν οἰκοδομούμενον τῷ ὀνό-
    ματι Κυρίου.

    ΚΕΦ. ΚΓʹ. XXIII.

    ΚΑΙ Δαυὶδ πρεσβύτης, καὶ πλήρης ἡμερῶν, καὶ ἐβασίλευσε 1
    Σαλωμὼν τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ συνήγαγε 2
    πάντας τοὺς ἄρχοντας Ἰσραήλ, καὶ τοὺς ἱερεῖς, καὶ τοὺς Λευί-
    τας. Καὶ ἠρίθμησαν οἱ Λευῖται ἀπὸ τριακονταετοῦς καὶ ἐπάνω, 3
    καὶ ἐγένετο ὁ ἀριθμὸς αὐτῶν κατὰ κεφαλὴν αὐτῶν εἰς ἄνδρας
    τριάκοντα καὶ ὀκτὼ χιλιάδας. ἀπὸ τούτων ἐργοδιῶκται ἐπὶ τὰ 4
    ἔργα οἴκου Κυρίου εἰκοσιτέσσαρες χιλιάδες, καὶ γραμματεῖς, καὶ
    κριταὶ ἑξακισχίλιοι· καὶ τέσσαρες χιλιάδες πυλωροί, καὶ τέσσα- 5
    ρες χιλιάδες αἰνοῦντες τῷ Κυρίῳ ἐν τοῖς ὀργάνοις οἷς ἐποίησαν
    τοῦ αἰνεῖν τῷ Κυρίῳ. Καὶ διεῖλεν αὐτοὺς Δαυὶδ ἐφημερίας ταῖς 6
    υἱοῖς Λευὶ, τῷ Γηρσών, Καάθ, καὶ Μεραρί· καὶ τῷ Γηρσὼν (τῷ) 7
    Λααδάν, καὶ (τῷ) Σεμεί· υἱοὶ Λααδάν· ὁ ἄρχων Ἰειὴλ, καὶ Ζαί- 8
    θὰμ, καὶ Ἰωὴλ, τρεῖς· καὶ υἱοὶ Σεμεί· Σαλωμειθ, καὶ ᾿Αζιὴλ, καὶ 9
    ᾿Αρὰν, τρεῖς· οὗτοι ἄρχοντες τῶν πατριῶν τῷ Λααδάν. Καὶ τοῖς 10
    υἱοῖς Σεμεί, Ἰὲθ, καὶ Ζιζὰ, καὶ Ἰωᾶς, καὶ Βαριὰ· οὗτοι υἱοὶ Σε-
    μεί τέσσαρες. Καὶ ἦν Ἰὲθ ὁ ἄρχων, καὶ Ζιζὰ ὁ δεύτερος· καὶ 11
    Ἰωᾶς, καὶ Βαριὰ οὐκ ἐπλήθυναν υἱοὺς, καὶ ἐγένοντο εἰς οἶκον πα-
    τριὰς εἰς ἐπίσκεψιν μίαν. Υἱοὶ Καάθ· ᾿Αμρὰμ καὶ Ἰσσαὰρ, Χε- 12
    βρὼν καὶ ᾿Οζιὴλ, τέσσαρες. Υἱοὶ ᾿Αμράμ· ᾿Ααρὼν, καὶ Μωϋσῆς· 13
    καὶ διεστάλη ᾿Ααρὼν τοῦ ἁγιασθῆναι ἅγια ἁγίων, αὐτὸς, καὶ οἱ
    υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ ἕως αἰῶνος, τοῦ θυμιᾶν ἐναντίον τοῦ Κυρίου, λειτουρ-
    γεῖν καὶ ἐπεύχεσθαι ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι αὐτοῦ ἕως αἰῶνος. Καὶ Μωϋ- 14
    σῆς ἄνθρωπος τοῦ Θεοῦ, υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ ἐκλήθησαν εἰς φυλὴν τοῦ Λευί.
    Υἱοὶ Μωϋσῆ· Γηρσὰμ, καὶ ᾿Ελιέζερ. Υἱοὶ Γηρσάμ· Σουβαὴλ ὁ 15.16
    ἄρχων. Καὶ ἦσαν υἱοὶ τῷ ᾿Ελιέζερ, Ῥααβιὰ ὁ ἄρχων· καὶ οὐκ 17
    ἦσαν τῷ ᾿Ελιέζερ υἱοὶ ἕτεροι. Καὶ υἱοὶ Ῥααβιὰ ηὐξήθησαν εἰς

**I CHRONICLES XXII.**

18 Is not the Lord with you? And hath He not given you rest on every side? For He hath delivered into my hand the inhabitants of the land, and the land is subdued before the Lord and before His people.
19 Now, therefore, give your hearts and your souls to seek the Lord your God. And arise, and build ye a sanctuary unto the Lord your God, that ye may bring in the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is being built unto the Name of the Lord.

**I CHRONICLES XXIII.**

1 And David was old and full of days, and he did cause Solomon his son to reign in his stead over Israel.
2 And he gathered all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.
3 And the Levites were numbered from thirty years old and upward; and the number of them by their polls, [even] the men, was thirty and eight thousand.
4 Of these, four and twenty thousand were overseers for the work of the House of the Lord; and six thousand were scribes and judges.
5 And four thousand were doorkeepers; and four thousand praised the Lord with the instruments which they had made for the purpose of praising the Lord.
6 And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi: unto Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
7 Of the Gershonites, (unto) Laadan, and (unto) Shimei.
8 The sons of Laadan: Jehiel the chief, and Zetham, and Joel, three.
9 And the sons of Shimei: Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the chiefs of the families for Laadan.
10 And the sons of Shimei were: Jahath, and Zizah, and Jeush, and Beriah; these were the four sons of Shimei.
11 And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second. And Jeush and Beriah multiplied not their sons, and they were accounted for one household of families in the census.
12 The sons of Kohath: Amram, and Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.
13 The sons of Amram: Aaron, and Moses. And Aaron was set apart to consecrate the most holy things, he and his sons forever, to burn incense before the Lord, to minister, and to bless in His Name forever.
14 And Moses, the man of God: his sons were reckoned among the tribe of Levi.
15 The sons of Moses: Gershom, and Eliezer.
16 Of the sons of Gershom: Shubael the chief.
17 And the sons of Eliezer were Rehabiah the chief; and Eliezer had none other sons.
18 And the sons of Rehabiah were greatly multiplied.
