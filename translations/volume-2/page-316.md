2 πρὸς Ἀχαὰβ εἰς Σαμάρειαν, καὶ ἔδωσεν αὐτῷ Ἀχαὰβ πρόβατα,
καὶ μόσχους πολλούς, καὶ τῷ λαῷ τῷ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀγαπῶν αὐ-
τὸν τοῦ συναναβῆναι μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ εἰς Ῥαμμὼθ τῆς Γαλααδίτιδος.
3 Καὶ εἶπεν Ἀχαὰβ βασιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς Ἰωσαφὰτ βασιλέα Ἰού-
δα· εἰ πορεύσῃ μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ εἰς Ῥαμμὼθ τῆς Γαλααδίτιδος; καὶ
εἶπεν αὐτῷ· ὡς ἐγώ, οὕτως καὶ σὺ· ὡς ὁ λαός σου, καὶ ὁ λαός
4 μου μετὰ σοῦ εἰς πόλεμον. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰωσαφὰτ πρὸς βασιλέα Ἰσραὴλ· ζήτησον δὴ σήμερον τὸν Κύριον.
5 Καὶ συνήγαγεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ τοὺς προφήτας τετρακοσίους ἄνδρας, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· εἰ πορευθῶ εἰς Ῥαμμὼθ Γαλαὰδ εἰς πόλεμον, ἢ ἐπίσχω; καὶ εἶπαν· ἀνάβαινε, καὶ δώσει ὁ Θεὸς εἰς τὰς χεῖρας τοῦ βασιλέως.
6 Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰωσαφὰτ· οὐκ ἔστιν ὧδε προφήτης τοῦ Κυρίου ἔτι. καὶ ἐπιζητήσομεν παρ᾿ αὐτοῦ;
7 Καὶ εἶπε βασιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς Ἰωσαφὰτ· ἔτι ἀνὴρ εἷς τοῦ ζητῆσαι τὸν Κύριον δι᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐγὼ ἐμίσησα αὐτόν, ὅτι οὐκ ἔστι προφητεύων περὶ ἐμοῦ εἰς ἀγαθά, ὅτι πᾶσαι αἱ ἡμέραι αὐτοῦ εἰς κακά, οὗτος Μιχαίας υἱὸς Ἰεμλὰ· καὶ εἶπεν Ἰωσαφὰτ· μὴ λαλεῖτω ὁ βασιλεὺς οὕτως.
8 Καὶ ἐκάλεσεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ εὐνοῦχον ἕνα, καὶ εἶπε· τάχος Μιχαίαν υἱὸν Ἰεμλά.
9 Καὶ βασιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ καὶ Ἰωσαφὰτ βασιλεὺς Ἰούδα καθήμενοι ἕκαστος ἐπὶ θρόνου αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐνδεδυμένοι στολάς, καθήμενοι ἐν τῷ εὐρυχώρῳ θύρας πύλης Σαμαρείας, καὶ πάντες οἱ προφῆται ἐπροφήτευον ἐναντίον αὐτῶν.
10 Καὶ ἐποίησεν ἑαυτῷ Σεδεκίας υἱὸς Χαναανὰ κέρατα σιδηρᾶ, καὶ εἶπε· τάδε λέγει Κύριος· ἐν τούτοις κερατιεῖς τὴν Συρίαν ἕως συντελεσθῇ.
11 Καὶ πάντες οἱ προφῆται ἐπροφήτευον οὕτως, λέγοντες· ἀνάβαινε εἰς Ῥαμμὼθ Γαλαάδ, καὶ εὐοδωθήσῃ, καὶ δώσει Κύριος εἰς χεῖρας τοῦ βασιλέως.
12 Καὶ ὁ ἄγγελος ὁ πορευθεὶς τοῦ καλέσαι τὸν Μιχαίαν, ἐλάλησεν αὐτῷ, λέγων· ἰδοὺ ἐλάλησαν οἱ προφῆται ἐν στόματι ἑνὶ ἀγαθὰ περὶ τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ ἔστωσαν δὴ οἱ λόγοι σου ὡς ἑνὸς αὐτῶν, καὶ λαλήσεις ἀγαθά.
13 Καὶ εἶπε Μιχαίας· Ζῇ Κύριος, ὅτι ὃ ἐὰν εἴπῃ ὁ Θεὸς πρὸς μέ, αὐτὸ λαλήσω.
14 Καὶ ἦλθε πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ βασιλεύς· Μιχαία, εἰ εἰσπορευθῶ εἰς Ῥαμμὼθ Γαλαὰδ εἰς πόλεμον, ἢ ἐπίσχω; καὶ εἶπεν· ἀνάβαινε, καὶ εὐοδώσεις, καὶ δοθήσονται εἰς χεῖρας ὑμῶν.
15 Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ βασιλεύς· ποσάκις ὁρκίσω σε ἵνα μὴ λαλήσῃς πρὸς ἐμὲ πλὴν ἀλήθειαν ἐν ὀνόματι Κυρίου;
16 Καὶ εἶπε· εἶδον διεσπαρ-

*(The Greek text for the latter part of verse 2 and the beginning of verse 16 is provided below. However, in accordance with the instruction "Do not translate or repeat anything in the [CONTEXT] window," the English translation for these portions has been omitted, as they are fully covered by the surrounding context.)*

³And Ahab, the king of Israel, said unto Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, "Wilt thou go with me to Ramoth-gilead?" And he answered him, "As I am, so art thou; and as thy people are, so are my people with thee in the battle."
⁴And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, "Inquire, I pray thee, this day of the Lord."
⁵Then the king of Israel gathered together the prophets, four hundred men, and said unto them, "Shall I go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?" And they said, "Go up; for God shall deliver it into the hand of the king."
⁶And Jehoshaphat said, "Is there not here a prophet of the Lord besides, that we might inquire of him?"
⁷Then the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, "There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the Lord, but I hate him; for he prophesieth not good concerning me, but evil continually; he is Micaiah the son of Imlah." And Jehoshaphat said, "Let not the king speak thus."
⁸Then the king of Israel called an eunuch, and said, "Haste thee, fetch Micaiah the son of Imlah."
⁹Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, clad in their robes, sitting in the open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.
¹⁰And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron, and he said, "Thus saith the Lord: With these shalt thou push Syria, until thou hast consumed them."
¹¹And all the prophets prophesied likewise, saying, "Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and thou shalt prosper, and the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king."
¹²And the messenger who went to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, "Behold, the prophets have with one mouth declared good unto the king; let thy word now be as the word of one of them, and speak thou good."
¹³And Micaiah said, "As the Lord liveth, whatsoever my God shall say unto me, that will I speak."
¹⁴So he came to the king; and the king said unto him, "Micaiah, shall I go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?" And he answered, "Go up, and thou shalt prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand."
¹⁵And the king said unto him, "How many times shall I adjure thee that thou speak not unto me but the truth in the name of the Lord?"
