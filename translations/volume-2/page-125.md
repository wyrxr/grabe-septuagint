γῆς· καὶ ἰσχύσεις, καὶ ἔσῃ εἰς ἄνδρα, καὶ φυλάξεις τὴν φυλακὴν 3
Κυρίου Θεοῦ σου τοῦ πορεύεσθαι ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὐτοῦ, φυλάσσειν
τὰς ἐντολὰς αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰ δικαιώματα αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰ κρίματα
αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰ μαρτύρια αὐτοῦ, τὰ γεγραμμένα ἐν τῷ νόμῳ Μωϋ-
σέως· ἵνα συνήξῃς ἃ ποιήσεις κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἐντείλωμαί σοι. Ἵνα 4
στήσῃ Κύριος τὸν λόγον αὐτοῦ ὃν ἐλάλησε περὶ ἐμοῦ, λέγων· ἐὰν
φυλάξωσιν οἱ υἱοί σου τὴν ὁδὸν αὐτῶν πορεύεσθαι ἐνώπιον μου ἐν
ἀληθείᾳ, ἐν ὅλῃ καρδίᾳ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐν ὅλῃ ψυχῇ αὐτῶν, λέγων·
οὐκ ἐξολοθρευθήσεταί σοι ἀνὴρ ἐπάνωθεν τοῦ θρόνου Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ 5
γε σὺ ἔγνως ὅσα μοι ἐποίησεν Ἰωὰβ υἱὸς Σαρουΐας, ὅσα ἐποίησεν
τοῖς δυσὶν ἄρχουσι τῶν δυνάμεων Ἰσραήλ, τῷ Ἀβεννὴρ υἱῷ Νήρ,
καὶ τῷ Ἀμεσσὰ υἱῷ Ἰεθέρ, καὶ ἀπέκτεινεν αὐτούς, καὶ ἔταξε τὰ
αἵματα πολέμου ἐν εἰρήνῃ, καὶ ἔδωκεν αἷμα ἀθῶον ἐν τῇ ζώνῃ
αὐτοῦ τῇ ἐν τῇ ὀσφῦϊ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐν τῷ ὑποδήματι αὐτοῦ τῷ ἐν τῷ
ποδὶ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ποιήσεις κατὰ τὴν σοφίαν σου, καὶ οὐ κατάξεις 6
τὴν πολιὰν αὐτοῦ ἐν εἰρήνῃ εἰς ᾅδου. Καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς Βερζελλαὶ 7
τοῦ Γαλααδίτου ποιήσεις ἔλεος, καὶ ἔσονται ἐν τοῖς ἐσθίουσι τὴν
τράπεζάν σου· ὅτι οὕτως ἤγγισάν μοι ἐν τῷ με ἀποδιδράσκειν ἀπὸ
προσώπου Ἀβεσσαλὼμ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου. Καὶ ἰδοὺ μετὰ τοῦ Σεμεεὶ 8
υἱὸς Γηρᾶ, υἱὸς τοῦ Ἰεμενεΐ, ἐκ Βαθουρείμ, καὶ αὐτὸς κατηράσατό
με κατάραν ὀδυνηρὰν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ᾗ ἐπορευόμην εἰς παρεμβολὰς, καὶ
αὐτὸς κατέβη εἰς ἀπάντησίν μου εἰς τὸν Ἰορδάνην· καὶ ὤμοσα αὐτῷ
ἐν Κυρίῳ, λέγων· εἰ θανατώσω σε ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ. Καὶ 9
οὐ μὴ ἀθωώσῃς αὐτόν, ὅτι ἀνὴρ σοφὸς εἶ σύ, καὶ γνώσῃ ἃ ποιήσεις
αὐτῷ, καὶ κατάξεις τὴν πολιὰν αὐτοῦ ἐν αἵματι εἰς ᾅδου.
Καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Δαυὶδ μετὰ τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐτάφη ἐν πόλει 10
Δαυίδ. Καὶ αἱ ἡμέραι ἃς ἐβασίλευσε Δαυὶδ ἐπὶ τὸν Ἰσραήλ, 11
τεσσαράκοντα ἔτη· ἐν Χεβρὼν ἐβασίλευσεν ἑπτὰ ἔτη, καὶ ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ
ἐβασίλευσε τριάκοντα καὶ τρία ἔτη. Καὶ Σαλωμὼν ἐκάθισεν 12
ἐπὶ τοῦ θρόνου Δαυὶδ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ ἐτῶν δώδεκα, καὶ
ἡτοιμάσθη ἡ βασιλεία αὐτοῦ σφόδρα. Καὶ εἰσῆλθεν Ἀδωνίας υἱὸς 13
Ἀγγὶθ πρὸς Βηθσαβεὲ μητέρα Σαλωμών, καὶ προσεκύνησεν αὐτήν.
εἰρήνη ἡ εἴσοδός σου; καὶ εἶπεν, εἰρήνη. Καὶ εἶπε· λόγος μοι πρὸς 14
σέ. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· λάλησον. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ· σὺ οἶδας, ὅτι 15
ἐμοὶ ἦν ἡ βασιλεία, καὶ ἐπ᾿ ἐμὲ ἔθετο πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ τὸ πρόσωπον
αὐτοῦ εἰς βασιλέα, καὶ ἐστράφη ἡ βασιλεία, καὶ ἐγενήθη τῷ ἀ[δελφῷ μου...]

### A Royal Translation of the Third Book of Kingdoms, Chapter 2

**2** [...of the earth.] Thou shalt be strong, and show thyself a man,
**3** and thou shalt keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in His ways, to keep His commandments, and His ordinances, and His judgments, and His testimonies, which are written in the Law of Moses; that thou mayest bring to pass whatsoever thou doest, according to all that I shall command thee.
**4** That the LORD may establish His word, which He spake concerning me, saying: "If thy sons shall keep their way, to walk before Me in truth, with all their heart, and with all their soul," saying, "there shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel."
**5** And verily thou knowest what Joab the son of Zeruiah did unto me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew; and he shed the blood of war in peace, and put innocent blood upon his girdle, which was about his loins, and upon his shoe, which was upon his foot.
**6** Do thou therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to Hades in peace.
**7** But unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite shalt thou show mercy, and let them be among those that eat at thy table; for so they drew nigh unto me when I fled from the face of Absalom thy brother.
**8** And behold, there is with thee Shimei the son of Gera, the son of the Jemeni, of Bahurim, and he cursed me with a grievous curse on the day when I went to Mahanaim; and he came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I sware to him by the LORD, saying, "I will not put thee to death with the sword."
**9** Now therefore hold him not guiltless, for thou art a wise man, and thou knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; and thou shalt bring down his hoar head with blood to Hades.
**10** So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.
**11** And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.
**12** Then Solomon sat upon the throne of David his father for twelve years, and his kingdom was established mightily.
**13** And Adonijah the son of Haggith came unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon; and he made obeisance unto her. And she said, "Comest thou peaceably?" And he answered, "Peaceably."
**14** Then he said, "I have a word to speak unto thee." And she said unto him, "Speak thou."
**15** And he said unto her, "Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces upon me, that I should reign; howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my bro[ther's].
