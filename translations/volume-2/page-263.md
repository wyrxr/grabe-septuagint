ΚΕΦ. ΙΓʹ.
Ἰσραήλ· εἰ ἐφ᾿ ὑμῖν ἀγαθόν, καὶ παρὰ Κυρίου Θεοῦ ἡμῶν εὐοδωθῇ, ἀποστείλωμεν πρὸς τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς ἡμῶν τοὺς ὑπολελειμμένους ἐν πάσῃ γῇ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ μετ᾿ αὐτῶν οἱ ἱερεῖς οἱ Λευῖται ἐν πόλεσι κατασχέσεως αὐτῶν, καὶ συναχθήσονται πρὸς ἡμᾶς, καὶ μετενέγκωμεν τὴν κιβωτὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν πρὸς ἡμᾶς, ὅτι οὐκ ἐξεζητήσαν αὐτὴν ἀφ᾿ ἡμερῶν Σαούλ. Καὶ εἶπε πᾶσα ἡ ἐκκλησία τοῦ ποιῆσαι οὕτως, ὅτι εὐθὺς ὁ λόγος ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ. Καὶ ἐξεκλησιάσε Δαυΐδ τὸν πάντα Ἰσραὴλ ἀπὸ ὁρίων Αἰγύπτου, καὶ ἕως εἰσόδου Ἡμὰθ τοῦ εἰσενέγκαι τὴν κιβωτὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐκ πόλεως Ἰαρείμ. Καὶ ἀνήγαγεν αὐτὴν Δαυΐδ· καὶ πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ ἀνέβη εἰς πόλιν Δαυΐδ, ἣ ἦν τοῦ Ἰούδα, τοῦ ἀναγαγεῖν ἐκεῖθεν τὴν κιβωτὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ Κυρίου καθημένου ἐπὶ Χερουβείμ, οὗ ἐπεκλήθη ὄνομα αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐπέθηκαν τὴν κιβωτὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐπὶ ἅμαξαν καινὴν ἐξ οἴκου Ἀμιναδάβ. Καὶ Ὀζά, καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ ἦγον τὴν ἅμαξαν. Καὶ Δαυΐδ, καὶ πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ παίζοντες ἐναντίον τοῦ Θεοῦ, ἐν πάσῃ δυνάμει, καὶ ἐν ψαλτῳδοῖς, καὶ ἐν κινύραις, καὶ ἐν νάβλαις, καὶ ἐν τυμπάνοις, καὶ ἐν κυμβάλοις, καὶ ἐν σάλπιγξι. Καὶ ἦλθοσαν ἕως τῆς ἅλωνος Χειδών· καὶ ἐξέτεινεν Ὀζὰ τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ τοῦ κατασχεῖν τὴν κιβωτόν, ὅτι ἐξέκλινεν αὐτὴν ὁ μόσχος. Καὶ ἐθυμώθη Κύριος ὀργῇ ἐπὶ Ὀζά, καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτὸν ἐκεῖ, διὰ τὸ ἐκτεῖναι τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν κιβωτόν· καὶ ἀπέθανεν ἐκεῖ ἀπέναντι τοῦ Θεοῦ. Καὶ ἠθύμησε Δαυΐδ, ὅτι διέκοψε Κύριος διακοπὴν ἐν Ὀζά, καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸν τόπον ἐκεῖνον Διακοπὴ Ὀζὰ ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης. Καὶ ἐφοβήθη Δαυΐδ τὸν Θεὸν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, λέγων· πῶς εἰσοίσω πρὸς ἐμαυτὸν τὴν κιβωτὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ; Καὶ οὐκ ἀπέστρεψε Δαυΐδ τὴν κιβωτὸν πρὸς ἑαυτὸν εἰς τὴν πόλιν Δαυΐδ, καὶ ἐξέκλινεν αὐτὴν εἰς οἶκον Ἀβεδδαρά τοῦ Γεθαίου. Καὶ ἐκάθισεν ἡ κιβωτὸς τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐν οἴκῳ Ἀβεδδαρά τρεῖς μῆνας· καὶ εὐλόγησεν ὁ Θεὸς τὸν Ἀβεδδαρά, καὶ πάντα τὰ αὐτοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΔʹ.

ΚΑὶ ἀπέστειλε Χειρὰμ βασιλεὺς Τύρου ἀγγέλους πρὸς Δαυΐδ, καὶ ξύλα κέδρινα, καὶ οἰκοδόμους τοίχων, καὶ τέκτονας ξύλων, τοῦ οἰκοδομῆσαι αὐτῷ οἶκον. Καὶ ἔγνω Δαυΐδ, ὅτι ἡτοίμασεν αὐτὸν Κύριος εἰς βασιλέα ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ, ὅτι ηὐξήθη εἰς ὕψος ἡ βασιλεία

**Chapter 13**

**2** Israel, if it seem good unto you, and if it be prospered by the Lord our God, let us send forth unto our brethren who are left in all the land of Israel, and with them the priests and the Levites in the cities of their possession, and they shall be gathered unto us;
**3** And let us bring over the ark of our God unto us, for they sought not after it from the days of Saul.
**4** And all the congregation resolved to do so; for the word seemed right in the eyes of all the people.
**5** And David assembled all Israel, from the borders of Egypt even unto the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from the city of Jearim.
**6** And David brought it up; and all Israel went up to the city of David, which was of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, the Lord [who is] seated upon the Cherubim, where His Name was invoked.
**7** And they set the ark of God upon a new cart from the house of Abinadab. And Uzza, and his brethren, drove the cart.
**8** And David, and all Israel, played before God with all their might, and with songs of praise, and with lyres, and with psalteries, and with tambourines, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.
**9** And they came unto the threshing floor of Chidon; and Uzza stretched forth his hand to hold the ark, for the ox had stumbled.
**10** And the Lord was wroth with Uzza, and smote him there, because he stretched forth his hand upon the ark; and he died there before God.
**11** And David was grieved, because the Lord had made a breach upon Uzza; and he called that place Perez Uzza, even unto this day.
**12** And David feared God on that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God unto me?
**13** And David brought not the ark back unto himself into the city of David, but turned it aside into the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.
**14** And the ark of God abode in the house of Obed-Edom for three months; and God blessed Obed-Edom, and all that he had.

**Chapter 14**

**1** And Hiram, king of Tyre, sent messengers unto David, and cedar timbers, and masons, and carpenters, to build him a house.
**2** And David knew that the Lord had prepared him to be king over Israel, because his kingdom was exalted unto great height.
