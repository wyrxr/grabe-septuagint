ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Δʹ. ΚΕΦ. ΙΖʹ.

4 λεὺς Ἀσσυρίων. Καὶ ἐγενήθη αὐτῷ Ὡσηὲ δοῦλος, καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν
αὐτῷ μαναά. Καὶ εὗρε βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων ἐν τῷ Ὡσηὲ ἀδικίαν,
ὅτι ἀπέστειλεν ἀγγέλους πρὸς Σωὰ βασιλέα Αἰγύπτου, καὶ οὐκ
ἤνεγκεν μαναὰ τῷ βασιλεῖ Ἀσσυρίων ἐν τῷ ἐνιαυτῷ ἐκείνῳ. Καὶ
ἐπολιόρκησεν αὐτὸν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων, καὶ ἔδησεν αὐτὸν ἐν
5 οἴκῳ φυλακῆς. Καὶ ἀνέβη ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ,
καὶ ἀνέβη εἰς Σαμάρειαν, καὶ ἐπολιόρκησεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὴν τρία ἔτη.
6 Ἐν ἔτει ἐννάτῳ Ὡσηὲ συνέλαβε βασιλεὺς Ἀσσυρίων τὴν Σαμά-
ρειαν, καὶ ἀπῴκισε τὸν Ἰσραὴλ εἰς Ἀσσυρίους, καὶ κατώκισεν
αὐτοὺς ἐν Ἀλλάε, καὶ ἐν Ἀβὼρ ποταμοῖς Γωζάν, καὶ Ὄρῃ Μήδων.
7 Καὶ ἐγένετο ὅτε ἥμαρτον οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ τῷ Κυρίῳ Θεῷ αὐτῶν
τῷ ἀναγαγόντι αὐτοὺς ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου ὑποκάτωθεν χειρὸς Φα-
8 ραὼ βασιλέως Αἰγύπτου, καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν θεοὺς ἑτέρους, καὶ ἐπο-
ρεύθησαν τοῖς δικαιώμασι τῶν ἐθνῶν, ὧν ἐξῆρε Κύριος ἀπὸ προ-
9 σώπου υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ οἱ βασιλεῖς Ἰσραὴλ ὅσοι ἐποίησαν, καὶ
ὅσοι ἠμφιέσαντο οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ λόγους, οὐχ οὕτως κατὰ Κυρίου
Θεοῦ αὐτῶν· καὶ (ὧν) ᾠκοδόμησαν ἑαυτοῖς ὑψηλὰ ἐν πάσαις ταῖς
10 πόλεσιν αὐτῶν ἀπὸ πύργου φυλασσόντων ἕως πόλεως ὀχυρᾶς. Καὶ
ἐστήλωσαν ἑαυτοῖς στήλας, καὶ ἄλση ἐπὶ παντὶ βουνῷ ὑψηλῷ, καὶ
11 ὑποκάτω παντὸς ξύλου ἀλσώδους. Καὶ ἐθυσίασαν ἐκεῖ ἐν πᾶσιν
ὑψηλοῖς, καθὼς τὰ ἔθνη ἃ ἀπῴκισε Κύριος ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτῶν,
καὶ ἐποίησαν κοινωνούς, καὶ ἐχάραξαν τοῦ παροργίσαι τὸν Κύριον.
12 Καὶ ἐλάτρευσαν τοῖς εἰδώλοις οἷς εἶπε Κύριος αὐτοῖς, οὐ ποιήσετε
τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο τῷ Κυρίῳ.
13 Καὶ διεμαρτύρατο Κύριος ἐν τῷ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐν Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐν
χειρὶ πάντων τῶν προφητῶν αὐτοῦ, παντὸς ὁρῶντος, λέγων, ἀπο-
στράφητε ἀπὸ τῶν ὁδῶν ὑμῶν τῶν πονηρῶν, καὶ φυλάξατε τὰς
ἐντολάς μου, καὶ τὰ δικαιώματά μου, καὶ πάντα τὸν νόμον ὃν
ἐνετειλάμην τοῖς πατράσιν ὑμῶν, ὅσα ἀπέστειλα (αὐτοὺς) πρὸς
ὑμᾶς ἐν χειρὶ τῶν δούλων μου, τῶν προφητῶν.
14 Καὶ οὐκ ἤκουσαν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐσκλήρυναν τὸν νῶτον αὐτῶν ὑπὲρ
τὸν νῶτον τῶν πατέρων αὐτῶν, οἳ οὐ ἐπίστευσαν Κυρίῳ Θεῷ
αὐτῶν.
15 Καὶ ἀπέῤῥιψαν τοὺς ἀκριβασμοὺς αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὴν συνθήκην
αὐτοῦ, ἣν ἔκοψε σὺν πατράσιν αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰ μαρτύρια αὐτοῦ,
ὅσα διεμαρτύρατο αὐτοῖς, οὐκ ἐφύλαξαν, καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν ὀπίσω
τῶν ματαίων, καὶ ἐματαιώθησαν, καὶ ὀπίσω τῶν ἐθνῶν τῶν
περικυκλωσάντων αὐτούς, ὧν ἐνετείλατο Κύριος αὐτοῖς τοῦ

### Literary Translation:

### 2 Kings 17

**4** the king of Assyria. And Hoshea became his servant, and rendered him tribute. But the king of Assyria found treachery in Hoshea, forasmuch as he had sent messengers unto So, king of Egypt, and had not brought tribute to the king of Assyria in that year. Therefore the king of Assyria besieged him, and bound him in a house of custody.
**5** And the king of Assyria went up against all the land, and came up to Samaria, and besieged it for three years.
**6** In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured Samaria, and deported Israel to Assyria, and settled them in Halah, and in Habor by the river Gozan, and in the mountains of the Medes.
**7** And it came to pass, because the children of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God, who had brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh, king of Egypt;
**8** and they feared other gods, and walked in the statutes of the nations whom the LORD had cast out from before the children of Israel;
**9** yea, and the kings of Israel, all those who did [evil], and all those of the children of Israel who clad themselves in [deceitful] words, not so according to the LORD their God; and (concerning which things) they built for themselves high places in all their cities, from the watchman's tower even unto the fortified city.
**10** And they set up for themselves pillars, and Asherahs upon every high hill, and beneath every luxuriant tree.
**11** And they sacrificed there in all high places, even as the nations whom the LORD had driven out from before them; and they made partners, and wrought provocations to anger the LORD.
**12** And they served idols, concerning which the LORD had said unto them, "Ye shall not do this thing unto the LORD."
**13** And the LORD testified among Israel, and among Judah, and by the hand of all His prophets, by every seer, saying, "Turn ye from your evil ways, and keep My commandments, and My statutes, and all the law which I commanded your fathers, all things which I sent (them) unto you by the hand of My servants, the prophets."
**14** Yet they hearkened not unto them, but hardened their neck beyond the neck of their fathers, who believed not the LORD their God.
**15** And they rejected His exact ordinances, and His covenant, which He had made with their fathers, and His testimonies, all that He had warned them concerning, they kept not; and they walked after vain things, and became vain themselves, and after the nations who were round about them, concerning which the LORD had commanded them not
