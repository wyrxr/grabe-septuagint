ΚΑΙ ἤγαγεν Ἰωὰβ πᾶσαν τὴν δύναμιν τῆς στρατιᾶς, καὶ ἔφθειραν
τὴν χώραν υἱῶν Ἀμμών· καὶ ἦλθαν, καὶ περιεκάθισαν τὴν Ῥαβ-
βάθ· καὶ Δαυὶδ ἐκάθητο ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ· καὶ ἐπάταξεν Ἰωὰβ τῷ
Ῥαββάθ, καὶ κατέσκαψεν αὐτήν. Καὶ ἔλαβε Δαυὶδ τὸν στέφανον
Μολχὸμ βασιλέως αὐτῶν ἀπὸ τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ εὑρέθη ὁ
σταθμὸς αὐτοῦ τάλαντον χρυσίου, καὶ ἐν αὐτῷ λίθος τίμιος, καὶ
ἦν ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν Δαυίδ· καὶ σκῦλα τῆς πόλεως ἐξήνεγκε πολ-
λὰ σφόδρα, καὶ τὸν λαὸν τὸν ἐν αὐτῇ ἐξήνεγκε, καὶ διέπρισε πρίοσι, 3
καὶ ἐν σκεπάρνοις σιδηροῖς, καὶ ἐν διασχίζουσι· καὶ οὕτως ἐποίησε
Δαυὶδ πάσαις ταῖς πόλεσιν υἱῶν Ἀμμών· καὶ ἀνέστρεψε Δαυίδ,
καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς αὐτοῦ εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ ταῦτα, 4
καὶ ἐγένετο ἔτι πόλεμος ἐν Γάζερ μετὰ τῶν ἀλλοφύλων· τότε ἐπά-
ταξε Σοββοχαὶ ὁ Οὐσαθὶ τὸν Σεπφὶ ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν τῶν γιγάντων,
καὶ ἐταπείνωσεν αὐτόν. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἔτι πόλεμος μετὰ τῶν ἀλλο- 5
φύλων, καὶ ἐπάταξεν Ἐλεανὼν υἱὸς Ἰαεὶρ τὸν Λεεμεὶ ἀδελφὸν Γο-
λιὰθ τοῦ Γεθθαίου, καὶ τὸ ξύλον τοῦ δόρατος αὐτοῦ ὡς ἀντίον
ὑφαινόντων. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἔτι πόλεμος ἐν Γέθ, καὶ ἦν ἀνὴρ ὑπερ- 6
μεγέθης, καὶ δάκτυλοι αὐτοῦ ἓξ καὶ ἕξ, εἰκοσιτέσσαρες, καὶ οὗτος
ἦν ἀπόγονος γιγάντων. Καὶ ὠνείδισε τὸν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐπάταξεν 7
αὐτὸν Ἰωναθὰν υἱὸς Σαμαὰ (υἱὸς) ἀδελφοῦ Δαυίδ. Οὗτοι ἐγένοντο 8
τῷ Ῥαφὰ ἐν Γέθ, πάντες ἦσαν τέσσαρες γίγαντες, καὶ ἔπε-
σαν ἐν χειρὶ Δαυίδ, καὶ ἐν χειρὶ παίδων αὐτοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΑ΄.

ΚΑΙ ἔστη διάβολος ἐν τῷ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐπέσεισε τὸν Δαυὶδ 1
τοῦ ἀριθμῆσαι τὸν Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ εἶπε Δαυὶδ πρὸς Ἰωάβ, καὶ πρὸς 2
τοὺς ἄρχοντας τῆς δυνάμεως· πορεύθητε, ἀριθμήσατε τὸν Ἰσραὴλ
ἀπὸ Βηρσαβεέ, καὶ ἕως Δάν, καὶ ἐνέγκατε πρὸς μέ, καὶ
γνώσομαι τὸν ἀριθμὸν αὐτῶν. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰωάβ· προσθείη Κύριος 3
ἐπὶ τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ, ὡς αὐτοὶ ἑκατονταπλασίως, καὶ οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ
τοῦ κυρίου μου τοῦ βασιλέως βλέποντες· πάντες τῷ κυρίῳ μου
παῖδες. Ἵνατί ζητεῖ ὁ κύριός μου τοῦτο, ἵνα μὴ γένηται εἰς ἁμαρτίαν
τῷ (λαῷ) Ἰσραήλ; Τὸ δὲ ῥῆμα τοῦ βασιλέως ἐκραταιώθη 4
ἐπὶ τῷ Ἰωάβ· καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Ἰωάβ, καὶ διῆλθεν ἐν παντὶ (ὁρίῳ) Ἰσραήλ,
καὶ ἦλθεν εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ ἔδωκεν Ἰωὰβ τὸν ἀριθμὸν 5

**1** And Joab led forth all the force of the army, and they utterly destroyed the land of the children of Ammon; and they came and besieged Rabbah; but David tarried in Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and utterly destroyed it.
**2** And David took the crown of Molchom, their king, from off his head, and found the weight thereof to be a talent of gold, and in it was a precious stone; and it was [set] upon David's head. And he brought forth exceeding much spoil from the city,
**3** and the people that were therein he brought forth, and put them under saws, and under iron axes, and under splitting instruments. Thus did David unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David returned, and all his people with him, unto Jerusalem.
**4** And it came to pass after these things, that there arose yet war at Gezer with the Philistines. Then Sibbechai the Hushathite smote Sippai, one of the sons of the giants, and brought him low.
**5** And there was yet again war with the Philistines, and Elhanan the son of Jair smote Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like unto a weaver's beam.
**6** And there was yet war in Gath, where was a man of great stature, whose fingers were six and six, four and twenty; and he also was a descendant of the giants.
**7** And he defied Israel, and Jonathan the son of Shimea (the son) of David's brother, slew him.
**8** These were born unto Rapha in Gath, and all four were giants; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.

**Chapter 21**

**1** And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.
**2** And David said to Joab, and to the captains of the army, "Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan, and bring [the count] to me, that I may know their number."
**3** And Joab answered, "The LORD add unto His people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the eyes of my lord the king may see it. Are they not all, my lord, the king's servants? Why then doth my lord require this thing, that it should not be for a sin to the (people) Israel?"
**4** Nevertheless, the word of the king prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all [the territory of] Israel, and came to Jerusalem.
**5** And Joab gave the number
