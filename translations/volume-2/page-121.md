ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Γ΄. ΚΕΦΑΛΑΙΟΝ Α΄. Ι.

ΚΑΙ ὁ βασιλεὺς Δαυὶδ πρεσβύτερος προβεβηκὼς ἡμέραις, 1
καὶ περιέβαλλον αὐτὸν ἱματίοις, καὶ οὐχ ἐθερμαίνετο. Καὶ εἶπαν 2
οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ· ζητησάτωσαν τῷ κυρίῳ ἡμῶν τῷ βασιλεῖ παρ-
θένον νεάνιδα, καὶ παραστήσεται ἐνώπιον τῷ βασιλεῖ, καὶ ἔσται αὐ-
τὸν θάλπουσα, καὶ κοιμηθήσεται μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ θερμανθήσεται ὁ
κύριος ἡμῶν ὁ βασιλεύς. Καὶ ἐζήτησαν νεάνιδα καλὴν ἐκ παντὸς 3
ὁρίου Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ εὗρον τὴν Ἀβισὰγ τὴν Σωμανῖτιν, καὶ ἤνεγ-
καν αὐτὴν πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα. Καὶ ἡ νεᾶνις καλὴ ἕως σφόδρα· 4
καὶ ἦν τὸν βασιλέα θάλπουσα, καὶ ἐλειτούργει αὐτῷ· καὶ ὁ βα-
σιλεὺς οὐκ ἔγνω αὐτήν. Καὶ Ἀδωνίας υἱὸς Ἀγὶθ ἐπήρετο, λέ- 5
γων· ἐγὼ βασιλεύσω. Καὶ ἐποίησεν ἑαυτῷ ἅρματα καὶ ἱππεῖς,
καὶ πεντήκοντα ἄνδρας παρατρέχοντας ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ οὐκ 6
ἀπεκώλυσεν αὐτὸν ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ οὐδέποτε, λέγων· διατί σὺ ἐποί-
ησας; καὶ γε αὐτὸς ὡραῖος τῇ ὄψει σφόδρα, καὶ αὐτὸν ἔτεκεν ὀπί-
σω Ἀβεσσαλώμ. Καὶ ἐγένοντο οἱ λόγοι αὐτοῦ μετὰ Ἰωὰβ τοῦ 7
υἱοῦ Σαρουίας, καὶ μετὰ Ἀβιάθαρ τοῦ ἱερέως· καὶ ἐβοήθουν ὀπίσω
Ἀδωνίου. Καὶ Σαδὼκ ὁ ἱερεύς, καὶ Βαναίας υἱὸς Ἰωιαδάε, καὶ 8
Νάθαν ὁ προφήτης, καὶ Σεμεεί, καὶ Ῥησί, καὶ υἱοὶ δυνατοὶ τοῦ
Δαυίδ, οὐχ ἦσαν ὀπίσω Ἀδωνίου. Καὶ ἐθυσίασεν Ἀδωνίας πρό- 9
βατα καὶ μόσχους καὶ ἄρνας παρὰ τὸν λίθον τοῦ Ζωελὲθ, ὅς ἦν ἐχόμενα
τῆς πηγῆς Ῥωγήλ. Καὶ ἐκάλεσε πάντας τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ τοὺς
υἱοὺς τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ πάντας τοὺς ἄνδρας Ἰούδα παῖδας τοῦ
βασιλέως, καὶ τὸν Νάθαν τὸν προφήτην, καὶ Βαναίαν, καὶ τοὺς 10
δυνατοὺς, καὶ τὸν Σαλωμῶντα τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἐκάλεσε.
Καὶ εἶπε Νάθαν πρὸς Βηθσαβεὲ μητέρα Σαλωμῶν, λέγων· οὐχ ἧ- 11
κουσας ὅτι ἐβασίλευσεν Ἀδωνίας υἱὸς Ἀγγίθ, καὶ ὁ κύριος ἡμῶν
(βασιλεὺς) Δαυὶδ οὐκ ἔγνω; Καὶ νῦν δεῦρο συμβουλεύσω σοι δὴ 12
συμβουλίαν καὶ ἐξελοῦ τὴν ψυχὴν σου, καὶ τὴν ψυχὴν τοῦ υἱοῦ
Σαλωμών.

### 1 Kings, Chapter 1

**1** Now King David was old and advanced in days; and though they did cover him with garments, yet was he not warmed.
**2** And his servants said unto him, "Let them seek for our lord the king a young virgin; and she shall stand before the king, and shall warm him, and shall lie with him, and our lord the king shall be warmed."
**3** So they sought a beautiful young woman throughout all the borders of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her unto the king.
**4** Now the young woman was exceedingly beautiful; and she did warm the king, and ministered unto him, but the king knew her not.
**5** And Adonijah, the son of Haggith, did exalt himself, saying, "I shall be king." And he prepared for himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men who should run before him.
**6** And his father had never restrained him, saying, "Why hast thou done this?" And indeed he himself was exceedingly beautiful in appearance, and his [mother] had borne him after Absalom.
**7** And his counsel was with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest; and they did support Adonijah.
**8** But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men of David, were not with Adonijah.
**9** And Adonijah sacrificed sheep and calves and lambs beside the stone of Zoheleth, which was [among] the parts adjoining the spring Rogel; and he called all his brothers, the sons of the king, and all the men of Judah, the king's servants.
**10** But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, did he not call.
**11** Then Nathan spoke unto Bathsheba, the mother of Solomon, saying, "Hast thou not heard that Adonijah, the son of Haggith, hath become king, and our lord (the king) David knew it not?"
**12** "Now therefore come, I pray thee, that I may give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thy life, and the life of the son Solomon."
