5 Καὶ ἀνέστησαν ἐν τῷ σκότει εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὴν παρεμβολὴν Συρίας· καὶ ἦλθον εἰς μέρος παρεμβολῆς Συρίας, καὶ ἰδοὺ οὐκ ἔστιν ἀνὴρ ἐκεῖ.
6 Καὶ Κύριος ἐποίησεν ἀκουστὴν παρεμβολὴν Συρίας φωνὴν ἅρματος, καὶ φωνὴν ἵππου, φωνὴν δυνάμεως μεγάλης. καὶ εἶπεν ἀνὴρ πρὸς τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ· νῦν ἐμισθώσατο ἐφ᾿ ἡμᾶς βασιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ τοὺς βασιλέας τῶν Χετταίων, καὶ τοὺς βασιλέας Αἰγύπτου τοῦ ἐλθεῖν ἐφ᾿ ἡμᾶς.
7 Καὶ ἀνέστησαν, καὶ ἀπέδρασαν ἐν τῷ σκότει, καὶ ἐγκατέλιπον τὰς σκηνὰς ἑαυτῶν, καὶ τοὺς ἵππους ἑαυτῶν, καὶ τοὺς ὄνους ἑαυτῶν ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ ὡς ἔστι, καὶ ἔφυγον πρὸς τὴν ψυχὴν ἑαυτῶν.
8 Καὶ εἰσῆλθον οἱ λεπροὶ οὗτοι ἕως μέρους τῆς παρεμβολῆς, καὶ εἰσῆλθον εἰς σκηνὴν μίαν, καὶ ἔφαγον, καὶ ἔπιον, καὶ ἦραν ἐκεῖθεν ἀργύριον, καὶ χρυσίον, καὶ ἱματισμόν· καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν, καὶ ἔκρυψαν, καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν, καὶ εἰσῆλθον εἰς σκηνὴν ἄλλην, καὶ ἔλαβον ἐκεῖθεν, καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν, καὶ κατέκρυψαν.
9 Καὶ εἶπεν ἀνὴρ πρὸς τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ· οὐχ οὕτως ἡμεῖς ποιοῦμεν. ἡ ἡμέρα αὕτη, ἡμέρα εὐαγγελίας ἐστί, καὶ ἡμεῖς σιωπῶμεν, καὶ μένομεν ἕως φωτὸς τοῦ πρωΐ, καὶ εὑρήσομεν ἀνομίαν· καὶ νῦν δεῦρο, καὶ εἰσέλθωμεν, καὶ ἀναγγείλωμεν εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ βασιλέως.
10 Καὶ εἰσῆλθον, καὶ ἐβόησαν πρὸς τὴν πύλην τῆς πόλεως, καὶ ἀνήγγειλαν αὐτοῖς, λέγοντες· εἰσήλθομεν εἰς τὴν παρεμβολὴν Συρίας, καὶ ἰδοὺ οὐκ ἔστιν ἐκεῖ ἀνὴρ, καὶ φωνὴ ἀνθρώπου, ὅτι εἰ μὴ ἵππος δεδεμένος, καὶ ὄνος δεδεμένος, καὶ αἱ σκηναὶ αὐτῶν ὡς εἰσί.
11 Καὶ ἐβόησαν οἱ θυρωροὶ, καὶ ἀνήγγειλαν εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ βασιλέως ἔσω.
12 Καὶ ἀνέστη ὁ βασιλεὺς νυκτός, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς τοὺς παῖδας αὐτοῦ· ἀναγγελῶ δὴ ὑμῖν ἃ ἐποίησεν ὑμῖν Συρία· ἔγνωσαν ὅτι πεινῶμεν ἡμεῖς, καὶ ἐξῆλθον ἐκ τῆς παρεμβολῆς, καὶ ἐκρύβησαν ἐν τῷ ἀγρῷ, λέγοντες· ὅτι ἐξελεύσονται ἐκ τῆς πόλεως, καὶ συλληψόμεθα αὐτοὺς ζῶντας, καὶ εἰς τὴν πόλιν εἰσελευσόμεθα, καὶ ἐξελευσόμεθα.
13 Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη εἷς τῶν παίδων αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπε· λαβέτωσαν πέντε ἀπὸ τῶν ἵππων τῶν ὑπολελειμμένων οἳ κατελείφθησαν ὧδε, ἰδοὺ εἰσὶ πρὸς πᾶν τὸ πλῆθος Ἰσραὴλ τὸ ἐκλεῖπον, καὶ ἀποστελοῦμεν ἐκεῖ, καὶ ὀψόμεθα.
14 Καὶ ἔλαβον δύο ἐπιβάτας ἵππων, καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ὁ βασιλεὺς ὀπίσω τοῦ βασιλέως Συρίας, λέγων· δεῦτε, καὶ ἴδετε.
15 Καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν ὀπίσω αὐτῶν ἕως τοῦ Ἰορδάνου· καὶ ἰδοὺ πᾶσα ἡ ὁδὸς πλήρης ἱματίων, καὶ σκευῶν, ὧν ἔῤῥιψε Συρία ἐν τῷ θαμβεῖσθαι αὐτούς.

**CHAPTER SEVEN.**

**4** ...us, then we shall die.
**5** So they arose in the darkness to enter into the camp of Syria; and they came unto a part of the camp of Syria, and behold, there was no man there.
**6** For the Lord had made the host of Syria to hear a sound of chariots, and a sound of horses, [even] the sound of a great army. And one man said unto his brother, "Now hath the king of Israel hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of Egypt, that they should come upon us."
**7** Wherefore they arose, and fled in the darkness, and left their tents, and their horses, and their donkeys in the camp as it was, and they fled for their lives.
**8** Then these lepers entered into a part of the camp; and they went into one tent, and did eat, and did drink, and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment; and they went and hid [it]. And they returned, and entered into another tent, and took thence, and went and hid [it].
**9** And one man said unto his neighbour, "We do not well. This day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace. If we tarry till the morning light, iniquity will overtake us; now therefore, come, let us go and tell the king's household."
**10** So they came, and called unto the gate of the city, and told them, saying, "We came to the camp of Syria, and behold, there is no man there, nor the voice of man, save only horses bound, and donkeys bound, and their tents as they are."
**11** And the gatekeepers cried out, and told it to the king's household within.
**12** And the king arose by night, and said unto his servants, "I will now show you what Syria hath done unto us. They know that we are hungry, and they are gone out of the camp, and have hid themselves in the field, saying, 'When they come forth out of the city, we will catch them alive, and we shall enter into the city, and we shall go out.'"
**13** And one of his servants answered and said, "Let them take five of the horses that are left, which remain here—behold, they are [but] as all the multitude of Israel that is failing—and let us send thither, and see."
**14** And they took two horsemen, and the king sent [them] after the king of Syria, saying, "Go, and see."
**15** And they went after them unto the Jordan; and behold, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which Syria had cast away in their dismay.
