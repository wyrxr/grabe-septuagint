αὐλῇ, καὶ ἔδωκε Μαρδοχαίῳ δόματα περὶ αὐτῶν. καὶ ἦν Ἁμὰν
Ἀμαδάθου Βουγαῖος ἔνδοξος ἐνώπιον τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ ἐζήτησε
κακοποιῆσαι τὸν Μαρδοχαῖον καὶ τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ, ὑπὲρ τῶν δύο
εὐνούχων τοῦ βασιλέως. Καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ τοὺς λόγους τούτους 1
ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις Ἀρταξέρξου, οὗτος Ἀρταξέρξης ἀπὸ τῆς ἰνδικῆς
ἑκατὸν εἰκοσιεπτὰ χωρῶν ἐκράτησεν. Ἐν ταύταις ταῖς ἡμέραις 2
ὅτι ἐθρονίσθη ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐν Σούσοις τῇ πόλει, ἐν τῷ 3
τρίτῳ ἔτει βασιλεύοντος αὐτοῦ, δοχὴν ἐποίησε τοῖς φίλοις, καὶ τοῖς
λοιποῖς ἔθνεσι, καὶ τοῖς Περσῶν καὶ Μήδων ἐνδόξοις, καὶ τοῖς ἄρ-
χουσι τῶν σατραπῶν. Καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα μετὰ τὸ δεῖξαι αὐτοῖς τὸν 4
πλοῦτον τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὴν δόξαν τῆς εὐφροσύνης τοῦ
πλούτου αὐτοῦ ἡμέρας ἑκατὸν ὀγδοήκοντα. Ὅτε δὲ ἀνεπληρώθη- 5
σαν αἱ ἡμέραι τοῦ γάμου, ἐποίησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς πότον τοῖς ἔθνεσι
τοῖς εὑρεθεῖσιν εἰς τὴν πόλιν ἡμέρας ἕξ, ἐν αὐλῇ τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ βα- 6
σιλέως, κεκοσμημένῳ βυσσίνοις καὶ καρπασίνοις τεταμένοις ἐπὶ
σχοινίοις βυσσίνοις καὶ πορφυροῖς, ἐπὶ κύβοις χρυσοῖς καὶ ἀργυροῖς,
ἐπὶ στύλοις παρίνοις καὶ λιθίνοις. κλῖναι χρυσαῖ καὶ ἀργυραῖ ἐπὶ
λιθοστρώτου σμαράγδου, καὶ παρίνου, καὶ πιννίνου λίθου. καὶ στρω-
μναὶ ἐπιφανεῖς ποικίλως διηνθισμέναι, καὶ κύκλῳ ῥόδα πεπασμένα.
Ποτήρια χρυσᾶ καὶ ἀργυρᾶ καὶ ἀνθράκινον κυλίκιον προκείμενον 7
ἀπὸ ταλάντων τρισμυρίων· οἶνος πολὺς καὶ ἡδύς, ἐν αὐτὸς ὁ βα-
σιλεὺς ἔπινεν. Ὁ δὲ πότος οὗτος οὐ κατὰ προκείμενον νόμον ἐγί- 8
νετο· οὕτως γὰρ ἠθέλησεν ὁ βασιλεύς, καὶ ἐπέταξε τοῖς οἰκονόμοις
ποιῆσαι τὸ θέλημα αὐτοῦ καὶ τῶν ἀνθρώπων. Καὶ Ἀστίν ἡ βα- 9
σίλισσα ἐποίησε πότον ταῖς γυναιξὶν ἐν τοῖς βασιλείοις, ὅπου ὁ
βασιλεὺς Ἀρταξέρξης. Ἐν δὲ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ ἡδέως ὁ βασι- 10
λεὺς γενόμενος, εἶπε τῷ Ἀμάν, καὶ Βαζᾶ, καὶ Ὀαρεθωά, καὶ
Ζηθαθαθά, καὶ Ἀβαταζᾶ, καὶ Θαβᾶ, τοῖς ἑπτὰ εὐνούχοις τοῖς
διακόνοις τοῦ βασιλέως Ἀρταξέρξου, εἰσαγαγεῖν τὴν βασίλισσαν 11
πρὸς αὐτόν, βασιλεύειν αὐτήν, καὶ περιθεῖναι αὐτῇ τὸ διάδημα·
καὶ δεῖξαι αὐτὴν πᾶσι τοῖς ἄρχουσι, καὶ τοῖς ἔθνεσι τὸ κάλλος αὐ-
τῆς, ὅτι καλὴ ἦν. Καὶ οὐκ εἰσήκουσεν αὐτοῦ Ἀστίν ἡ βασίλισ- 12
σα ἐλθεῖν μετὰ τῶν εὐνούχων· καὶ ἐλυπήθη ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ ὠργί- 13
σθη, καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τοῖς φίλοις ἑαυτοῦ, κατὰ ταῦτα ἐλάλη- 14
σεν Ἀστίν, ποιήσατε οὖν περὶ τούτου νόμον καὶ κρίσιν. Καὶ προσ-
ῆλθεν αὐτῷ Ἀρκεσαῖος, καὶ Σαρεσθαῖος, καὶ Μαλησεὰρ οἱ ἄρχον-

#### CHAPTER I

<sup>1</sup> And it came to pass after these things, in the days of Artaxerxes, [even] this Artaxerxes who ruled over one hundred and twenty-seven provinces from India.
<sup>2</sup> In those days, when King Artaxerxes was enthroned in Susa the city,
<sup>3</sup> in the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto his friends, and unto the other nations, and unto the glorious ones of the Persians and Medes, and unto the rulers of the satrapies.
<sup>4</sup> And after these things, after he had shown them the riches of his kingdom, and the glory of the joyousness of his wealth, for one hundred and eighty days.
<sup>5</sup> But when the days of the wedding feast were fulfilled, the king made a banquet for the nations that were found in the city, for six days,
<sup>6</sup> in the court of the king's house, adorned with hangings of fine linen and cotton, stretched upon cords of fine linen and purple, upon cubes of gold and silver, upon pillars of Parian stone and other stones. Beds of gold and silver [were set] upon a pavement of emerald, and of Parian, and of Pinnine stone; and splendid couches, diversely adorned with flowers, and roses scattered all around.
<sup>7</sup> Cups of gold and silver, and a carnelian goblet set forth, [worth] thirty thousand talents; there was much and sweet wine, wherein the king himself did drink.
<sup>8</sup> Now this drinking was not according to a prescribed law; for so the king had willed, and he commanded his stewards to do his will and that of the men.
<sup>9</sup> And Astin the queen made a banquet for the women in the royal palace, where King Artaxerxes [was].
<sup>10</sup> Now on the seventh day, when the king was merry, he spake unto Aman, and Bazan, and Oarethoa, and Zethathatha, and Abataza, and Thaba, the seven eunuchs who ministered unto King Artaxerxes,
<sup>11</sup> to bring in the queen unto him, to make her queen, and to place the diadem upon her; and to show her beauty unto all the rulers and unto the nations, for she was fair to behold.
<sup>12</sup> But Astin the queen would not hearken unto him to come with the eunuchs;
<sup>13</sup> and the king was grieved and became wroth,
<sup>14</sup> and the king said unto his friends, "Astin hath spoken [thus]; therefore, make ye a law and a judgment concerning this matter." And there came unto him Arkesaios, and Saresthaios, and Malesear, the rulers
