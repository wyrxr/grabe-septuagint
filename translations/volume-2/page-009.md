ΚΕΦ. Β΄. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Α΄. 485
στόματος παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ Κυρίου τούτου; Μὴ τέκνα, ὅτι οὐκ 24
ἀγαθὴ ἡ ἀκοὴ ἣν ἐγὼ ἀκούω, (μὴ ποιεῖτε οὕτως, ὅτι οὐκ ἀγα-
θαὶ αἱ ἀκοαὶ ἃς ἐγὼ ἀκούω,) τοῦ μὴ δουλεύειν λαὸν Θεῷ. Ἐὰν 25
ἁμαρτάνων ἁμαρτάνῃ ἀνὴρ εἰς ἄνδρα, καὶ προσεύξονται ὑπὲρ αὐ-
τοῦ πρὸς Κύριον· καὶ ἐὰν τῷ Κυρίῳ ἁμάρτῃ ἀνήρ, τίς προσεύ-
ξεται περὶ αὐτοῦ; Καὶ οὐκ ἤκουον τῆς φωνῆς τοῦ πατρὸς αὐ-
τῶν, ὅτι βουλόμενος ἐβούλετο Κύριος διαφθεῖραι αὐτούς. Καὶ τὸ 26
παιδάριον Σαμουὴλ ἐπορεύετο μεγαλυνόμενον, καὶ ἀγαθὸν καὶ με-
τὰ Κυρίου καὶ μετὰ ἀνθρώπων. Καὶ ἦλθεν ὁ ἄνθρωπος Θεοῦ 27
πρὸς Ἡλεί, καὶ εἶπε· τάδε λέγει Κύριος· ἀποκαλυφθεὶς ἀπεκα-
λύφθην πρὸς οἶκον πατρός σου, ὄντων αὐτῶν ἐν τῇ Αἰγύπτῳ δού-
λων τῷ οἴκῳ Φαραώ· καὶ ἐπελεξάμην τὸν οἶκον τοῦ πατρός σου 28
ἐκ πάντων σκήπτρων Ἰσραὴλ ἐμοὶ ἱερατεύειν, τοῦ ἀναβαίνειν ἐπὶ
τὸ θυσιαστήριόν μου, καὶ θυμιᾶν θυμίαμα καὶ αἴρειν Ἐφοὺδ ἐνώ-
πιον ἐμοῦ· καὶ ἔδωκα τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ πατρός σου τὰ πάντα τοῦ
πυρὸς υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ εἰς βρῶσιν. Καὶ ἵνατί ἐπεβλέψατε ἐπὶ τὸ θυ- 29
μίαμά μου καὶ εἰς τὴν θυσίαν μου ἀναιδεῖ ὀφθαλμῷ; καὶ ἐδόξασας
τοὺς υἱούς σου ὑπὲρ ἐμέ, ἐνευλογεῖσθαι ἀπ᾿ ἀρχῆς πάσης θυσίας
Ἰσραὴλ ἔμπροσθέν μου; Διὰ τοῦτο τάδε εἶπε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσ- 30
ραήλ· εἶπας εἶπα, ὁ οἶκός σου καὶ ὁ οἶκος τοῦ πατρός σου διε-
λεύσεται ἐνώπιόν μου ἕως αἰῶνος· καὶ νῦν φησι Κύριος· μηδαμῶς
ἔμοι, ὅτι ἀλλ᾿ ἢ τοὺς δοξάζοντάς με δοξάσω, καὶ ὁ ἐξουθενῶν με
ἀτιμασθήσεται. Ἰδοὺ ἡμέραι ἔρχονται, καὶ ἐξολοθρεύσω τὸ σπέρ- 31
μα σου καὶ τὸ σπέρμα οἴκου πατρός σου, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται (σου)
πρεσβύτης ἐν οἴκῳ σου· καὶ ἐπιβλέψῃ κραταίωμα Μαῶν ἐν πᾶσιν 32
τοῖς ἀγαθοῖς τὸν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται πρεσβύτης ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ
σου πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας. Καὶ ἄνδρα οὐκ ἐξολοθρεύσω σοι ἀπὸ τοῦ 33
θυσιαστηρίου μου, ἐκλείπειν τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ, καὶ καταῤῥεῖν
τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ· καὶ πᾶν περισσεῦον οἴκου σου πεσοῦνται ἐν ῥομ-
φαίᾳ ἀνδρῶν. Καὶ τοῦτό σοι τὸ σημεῖον ὃ ἥξει ἐπὶ τοὺς δύο υἱ- 34
ούς σου τούτους, πρὸς Ὀφνεὶ καὶ Φινεές· ἐν ἡμέρᾳ μιᾷ ἀποθα-
νοῦνται ἀμφότεροι. Καὶ ἀναστήσω ἐμαυτῷ ἱερέα πιστόν, ὃς πάν- 35
τα τὰ ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ μου καὶ τὰ ἐν τῇ ψυχῇ μου ποιήσει· καὶ οἰ-
κοδομήσω αὐτῷ οἶκον πιστόν, καὶ διελεύσεται ἐνώπιον χριστῶν
μου πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας (μου). Καὶ ἔσται, πᾶς ὁ περισσεύων ἐν 36
οἴκῳ σου, ἥξει προσκυνῆσαι αὐτῷ ἐν ὀβολῷ ἀργυρίου καὶ ἐν ἄρτῳ

**Chapter 2**

24 —the mouth of all this people of the Lord? Nay, my children, for not good is the report which I hear (do not act so, for not good are the reports which I hear), to keep the people of God from serving God.
25 If a man should sin against another man, then may one pray for him unto the Lord; but if a man should sin against the Lord, who then shall pray for him? Yet they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, for the Lord was minded to destroy them.
26 And the child Samuel went on, growing great and finding favor both with the Lord and with men.

27 And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said, "Thus saith the Lord: I did clearly reveal Myself unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt, bondmen to the house of Pharaoh;
28 and I chose the house of thy father out of all the tribes of Israel to be My priest, to ascend upon My altar, and to burn incense, and to bear the Ephod before Me; and I gave unto the house of thy father all the fire-offerings of the sons of Israel for food.
29 Wherefore have ye cast an impudent eye upon My incense and upon My sacrifice? And thou hast honored thy sons above Me, that they might be enriched from the best of every sacrifice of Israel before Me?

30 Therefore thus saith the Lord God of Israel: 'Thou didst say, I said, The house of thine and the house of thy father shall walk before Me forever.' But now saith the Lord: Far be it from Me! For only them that honor Me will I honor, and he that despiseth Me shall be dishonored.
31 Behold, the days are coming, when I shall cut off thy seed and the seed of thy father's house, and there shall not be an old man (of thine) in thy house.
32 And thou shalt look upon the strength of Maon amidst all the blessings [bestowed upon] Israel, and there shall not be an old man in thy house all the days.
33 And a man I will not cut off from thee from My altar, to cause his eyes to fail, and his soul to waste away; and all the remnant of thy house shall fall by the sword of men.
34 And this shall be a sign unto thee, which shall come upon thy two sons, upon Ophni and Phinees: in one day shall both of them die.
35 And I will raise up for Myself a faithful priest, who shall do all that is in My heart and in My soul; and I will build him a sure house, and he shall walk before My anointed ones all My days.
36 And it shall be, that every one that is left in thy house shall come to bow down to him for an obol of silver and for a loaf of bread,"
