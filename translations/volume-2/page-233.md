ΚΕΦ. ΚΓʹ. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Δʹ. 709
15 τὸ ἄλσος. Καὶ ἐξένευσεν Ἰωσίας, καὶ εἶδε τοὺς τάφους οἳ ἐκεῖ
16 ἐν τῇ πόλει, καὶ ἀπέστειλε, καὶ ἔλαβε τὰ ὀστᾶ ἐκ τῶν τάφων,
καὶ κατέκαυσεν ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον, καὶ ἐμίανεν αὐτὸ κατὰ τὸ
ῥῆμα Κυρίου, ὃ ἐλάλησεν ὁ ἄνθρωπος τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐν τῷ ἑστάναι Ἱε-
ροβοὰμ ἐν τῇ ἑορτῇ ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον. Καὶ ἐπιστρέψας ἦρε
17 τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὸν τάφον τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τοῦ Θεοῦ
τοῦ λαλήσαντος τοὺς λόγους τούτους, καὶ εἶπε· τί τὸ σκόπελον
ἐκεῖνο ὃ ἐγὼ ὁρῶ; Καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῷ οἱ ἄνδρες τῆς πόλεως· ὁ ἄν-
θρωπος τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐστιν, ὃ ἐξεληλυθὼς ἐκ τοῦ Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐπικα-
λεσάμενος τοὺς λόγους τούτους οὓς ἐπεκαλέσατο ἐπὶ τὸ θυσια-
στήριον Βαιθήλ.
18 Καὶ εἶπεν· ἄφετε αὐτόν, ἀνὴρ μὴ κινησάτω τὰ ὀστᾶ αὐτοῦ. καὶ
ἐρύσθησαν τὰ ὀστᾶ αὐτοῦ μετὰ τῶν ὀστῶν τοῦ προφήτου τοῦ
ἥκοντος ἐκ Σαμαρείας.
19 Καὶ γε (εἰς) πάντας τοὺς οἴκους τῶν ὑψηλῶν τοὺς ἐν ταῖς πόλεσι
Σαμαρείας, οὓς ἐποίησαν βασιλεῖς Ἰσραὴλ παροργίζειν Κύριον,
ἀπέστησεν Ἰωσίας βασιλεὺς Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἐποίησεν ἐν αὐτοῖς
πάντα τὰ ἔργα ἃ ἐποίησεν ἐν Βαιθήλ.
20 Καὶ ἐθυσίασε πάντας τοὺς ἱερεῖς τῶν ὑψηλῶν τοὺς ὄντας ἐκεῖ
ἐπὶ τῶν θυσιαστηρίων, καὶ κατέκαυσε τὰ ὀστᾶ τῶν ἀνθρώπων
ἐπ᾽ αὐτά, καὶ ἐπεστράφη εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ.
21 Καὶ ἐνετείλατο ὁ βασιλεὺς παντὶ τῷ λαῷ, λέγων, ποιήσατε πάσχα
τῷ Κυρίῳ Θεῷ ἡμῶν, καθὼς γέγραπται ἐπὶ βιβλίῳ τῆς διαθήκης
ταύτης·
22 ὅτι οὐκ ἐγενήθη τὸ πάσχα τοῦτο ἀφ᾽ ἡμερῶν τῶν κριτῶν, οἳ
ἔκριναν τὸν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ πασῶν ἡμερῶν βασιλέων Ἰσραήλ, καὶ
βασιλέων Ἰούδα·
23 ἔτι ἀλλ᾽ ἢ τῷ ὀκτωκαιδεκάτῳ ἔτει τοῦ βασιλέως Ἰωσίου ἐγενήθη
τὸ πάσχα τοῦτο τῷ Κυρίῳ ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ.
24 Καὶ γε τοὺς θελητάς, καὶ τοὺς γνωριστάς, καὶ τὰ Θεραφείμ, καὶ
τὰ εἴδωλα, καὶ πάντα τὰ προσοχθίσματα τὰ γεγονότα ἐν τῇ γῇ
Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐξῆρεν Ἰωσίας, ἵνα στήσῃ τοὺς λόγους
τοῦ νόμου τοὺς γεγραμμένους ἐπὶ τῷ βιβλίῳ ᾧ εὗρε Χελκίας ὁ
ἱερεὺς ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου.
25 Ὅμοιος αὐτῷ οὐκ ἐγενήθη ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ βασιλεύς, ὃς
ἐπέστρεψε πρὸς Κύριον ἐν ὅλῃ καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐν ὅλῃ ψυχῇ
αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐν ὅλῃ ἰσχύϊ αὐτοῦ κατὰ πάντα τὸν νόμον Μωϋσέως,
καὶ μετ᾽ αὐτὸν οὐκ ἀνέστη ὅμοιος αὐτῷ.
26 Πλὴν οὐκ ἀπεστράφη Κύριος ἀπὸ θυμοῦ τῆς ὀργῆς αὐτοῦ τῆς
μεγάλης, οὗ ἐθυμώθη ὀργὴ αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ Ἰούδᾳ ἐπὶ τοὺς
παροργισμούς, οὓς παρώργισεν αὐτὸν Μανασ-

### 2 Kings 23

**15** ...and burned the Asherah. And Josiah, turning aside, looked and beheld the sepulchers that were there
**16** in the city; and he sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchers, and burned them upon the altar, and defiled it, according to the word of the Lord, which the man of God had spoken when Jeroboam stood at the altar in the feast. And he turned back and lifted up
**17** his eyes toward the sepulcher of the man of God who had spoken these words, and said, "What is that monument which I see?" And the men of the city said unto him, "It is the sepulcher of the man of God, who came out of Judah, and proclaimed these words which he had proclaimed against the altar of Bethel."
**18** And he said, "Let him alone; let no man move his bones." So his bones were spared with the bones of the prophet who came out of Samaria.
**19** And moreover, [as for] all the houses of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the Lord to anger, Josiah the king of Jerusalem did remove; and he did unto them all the works which he had done in Bethel.
**20** And he sacrificed all the priests of the high places who were there upon the altars, and burned the bones of men upon them, and returned to Jerusalem.
**21** And the king commanded all the people, saying, "Keep the Passover unto the Lord our God, as it is written in this book of the covenant."
**22** For there had not been held such a Passover as this from the days of the judges who judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;
**23** but [only] in the eighteenth year of King Josiah was this Passover kept unto the Lord in Jerusalem.
**24** And moreover, the diviners, and the spiritists, and the Teraphim, and the idols, and all the abominations that had been in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah remove, that he might establish the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest had found in the house of the Lord.
**25** And there was no king like him before him, who turned to the Lord with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the Law of Moses; neither after him arose there any like him.
**26** Nevertheless, the Lord turned not from the fierceness of His great wrath, wherewith His wrath was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations wherewith Manas-
