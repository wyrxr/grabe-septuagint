ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Α΄. ΚΕΦ. ΛΑ΄.
σκύλων, καὶ ἕως πάντων ὧν ἔλαβον αὐτῶν καὶ πάντα ἐπέστρεψε 20
Δαυίδ. Καὶ ἔλαβε Δαυίδ πάντα τὰ ποίμνια καὶ τὰ βουκόλια, καὶ
ἀπήγαγεν ἔμπροσθεν τῶν σκύλων· καὶ τοῖς σκύλοις ἐκείνοις ἐλέγετο·
ταῦτα σκῦλα Δαυίδ. Καὶ παραγίνεται Δαυίδ πρὸς τοὺς διακοσίους ἄν- 21
δρας τοὺς ἐκλυθέντας τοῦ πορεύεσθαι ὀπίσω Δαυίδ, καὶ ἐκάθισεν
αὐτοὺς ἐν τῷ χειμάρρῳ τῷ Βοσὸρ, καὶ ἐξῆλθον εἰς ἀπάντησιν
Δαυίδ καὶ εἰς ἀπάντησιν τοῦ λαοῦ τοῦ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ προσήγαγε
Δαυίδ ἕως τοῦ λαοῦ, καὶ ἠρώτησαν αὐτὸν εἰς εἰρήνην. Καὶ ἀπε- 22
κρίθη πᾶς ἀνὴρ λοιμὸς καὶ πονηρὸς τῶν ἀνδρῶν τῶν πολεμιστῶν
τῶν πορευθέντων μετὰ Δαυίδ, καὶ εἶπε· διότι οὐ κατεδίωξαν μεθ᾿
ἡμῶν, οὐ δώσομεν αὐτοῖς ἐκ τῶν σκύλων ὧν ἐξειλάμεθα, ὅτι
ἀλλ᾿ ἢ ἕκαστος τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰ τέκνα αὐτοῦ ἀπαγέ-
σθωσαν, καὶ ἀποστρεφέτωσαν. Καὶ εἶπε Δαυίδ· οὐ ποιήσετε οὕτως, 23
ἀδελφοί μου, μετὰ τὸ παραδοῦναι τὸν Κύριον ἡμῖν, καὶ φυλάξαι
ἡμᾶς, καὶ παρέδωκε Κύριος τὸν Γεδδοὺρ τὸν ἐπερχόμενον ἐφ᾿ ἡ-
μᾶς εἰς χεῖρας ἡμῶν. Καὶ τίς ἐπακούσεται ὑμῶν τῶν λόγων 24
τούτων; ὅτι οὐχ ἧττον ὑμῶν εἰσι· διότι κατὰ τὴν μερίδα τοῦ κα-
ταβαίνοντος εἰς πόλεμον, οὕτως ἔσται ἡ μερὶς τοῦ καθημένου ἐπὶ
τὰ σκεύη, κατὰ τὸ αὐτὸ μεριοῦνται. Καὶ ἐγενήθη ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέ- 25
ρας ἐκείνης καὶ ἐπάνω· καὶ ἐγένετο εἰς πρόσταγμα καὶ εἰς δι-
καίωμα τῷ Ἰσραὴλ ἕως τῆς σήμερον. Καὶ ἦλθε Δαυίδ εἰς Σικε- 26
λὰγ, καὶ ἀπέστειλε τῶν σκύλων τοῖς πρεσβυτέροις Ἰούδα, καὶ
τοῖς πλησίον αὐτοῦ, λέγων· Ἰδοὺ ὑμῖν εὐλογία ἀπὸ τῶν σκύλων
τῶν ἐχθρῶν Κυρίου, τοῖς ἐν Βαιθὴλ, καὶ τοῖς ἐν Ῥαμᾶ νότου, καὶ 27
τοῖς ἐν Ἰεθὲρ, καὶ τοῖς ἐν Ἀροὴρ, καὶ τοῖς ἐν Σαφαμὼς, καὶ τοῖς ἐν 28
Ἐσθεμὰ, καὶ τοῖς ἐν Ῥαχὴλ, καὶ τοῖς ἐν ταῖς πόλεσιν τοῦ Ἰεραμηὴλ, 29
καὶ τοῖς ἐν ταῖς πόλεσιν τοῦ Κειναίου, καὶ τοῖς ἐν Ἑρμᾶ, 30
καὶ ἐν Βωρασὰν, καὶ τοῖς ἐν Ἀθὰγ, καὶ τοῖς ἐν Χεβρὼν, 31
καὶ εἰς πάντας τοὺς τόπους οὓς διῆλθε Δαυίδ ἐκεῖ αὐτὸς καὶ οἱ
ἄνδρες αὐτοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. ΛΑ΄. ΧΧΧΙ.

ΚΑὶ οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι ἐπολέμουν ἐπὶ Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ ἔφυγον οἱ ἄν- 1
δρες Ἰσραὴλ ἐκ προσώπου τῶν ἀλλοφύλων, καὶ πίπτουσι τραυ-
ματίαι ἐν τῷ ὄρει τῷ Γελβουέ. Καὶ συνάπτουσιν ἀλλόφυλοι τῷ 2

...of the spoils, and even all that they had taken from them; and David brought back all.
**20** And David took all the flocks and the herds, and he drove them before the spoils; and it was said concerning those spoils: "These be David's spoils."
**21** And David came unto the two hundred men who were faint from pursuing after David, and he had caused them to tarry at the Brook Besor. And they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him; and David drew nigh unto the people, and they inquired of him concerning [their] welfare.
**22** Then answered every wicked and lawless man among the warriors who had gone with David, and said, "Because they went not with us, we will not give them of the spoils which we have recovered, but only that each man may take his wife and his children, and so depart."
**23** And David said, "Ye shall not do so, my brethren, after that the Lord hath delivered [this] unto us, and hath preserved us. For the Lord hath delivered the raiding band, which came against us, into our hands.
**24** And who among you shall hearken unto these words? For they are not less [worthy] than you; because as is the portion of him that goeth down to battle, so shall be the portion of him that tarrieth by the baggage: they shall divide equally."
**25** And it came to pass from that day forward, that it was made a statute and an ordinance for Israel, even unto this day.
**26** And David came to Ziklag, and sent of the spoils unto the elders of Judah, and to his neighbors, saying, "Behold, a blessing for you from the spoils of the enemies of the Lord!"
**27** —to those in Bethel, and to those in Ramoth of the South, and to those in Jattir,
**28** and to those in Aroer, and to those in Saphamo, and to those in Eshtemoa,
**29** and to those in Racal, and to those in the cities of the Jerahmeelites,
**30** and to those in the cities of the Kenites, and to those in Hormah,
**31** and in Borashan, and to those in Athach, and to those in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men had passed through.
