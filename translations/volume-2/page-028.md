504 ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Α´. ΚΕΦ. ΙΓ´ ΙΔ´.
14 ἣν ἐνετείλατό σοι Κύριος· ὡς νῦν ἡτοίμασε Κύριος τὴν βασιλεί-
αν σου ἐπὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἕως αἰῶνος· καὶ νῦν ἡ βασιλεία σου οὐ στή-
σεται σοι, καὶ ζητήσει Κύριος ἑαυτῷ ἄνθρωπον κατὰ τὴν καρ-
δίαν αὑτοῦ, καὶ ἐντελεῖται Κύριος αὑτῷ εἰς ἄρχοντα ἐπὶ τὸν λα-
15 ὸν αὑτοῦ, ὅτι οὐκ ἐφύλαξας ὅσα ἐνετείλατό σοι Κύριος. Καὶ
ἀνέστη Σαμουήλ, καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ἐκ Γαλγάλων· καὶ τὸ κατάλειμ-
μα τοῦ λαοῦ ἀνέβη ὀπίσω Σαοὺλ εἰς ἀπάντησιν ὀπίσω τοῦ λαοῦ
τοῦ πολεμιστοῦ, αὑτῶν παραγενομένων ἐκ Γαλγάλων εἰς Γα-
βαὰ Βενιαμείν· καὶ ἐπεσκέψατο Σαοὺλ τὸν λαὸν τὸν εὑρεθέν-
16 τα μετ᾿ αὑτοῦ ὡς ἑξακοσίους ἄνδρας. Καὶ Σαοὺλ καὶ Ἰωνά-
θαν υἱὸς αὑτοῦ καὶ ὁ λαὸς οἱ εὑρεθέντες μετ᾿ αὑτῶν ἐκάθισαν
ἐν Γαβαὰ Βενιαμείν καὶ ἔκλαιον, καὶ οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι παρεμβεβλή-
17 κεισαν ἐν Μαχμάς. Καὶ ἐξῆλθε διαφθείρων ἐξ ἀγροῦ ἀλλοφύλων
τρισὶν ἀρχαῖς· ἡ ἀρχὴ ἡ μία ἐπιβλέπουσα ὁδὸν Γοφερὰ ἐπὶ γῆν
18 Σωγάλ, καὶ ἡ ἀρχὴ ἡ μία ἐπιβλέπουσα ὁδὸν Βαιθωρών,
καὶ ἡ ἀρχὴ ἡ μία ἐπιβλέπουσα ὁδὸν Γαβαέ, τὴν εἰσχύπτουσαν
19 ἐπὶ Γαὶ τὴν Σαβεὶμ τὴν ἔρημον. Καὶ τέκτων σιδήρου οὐχ εὑ-
ρίσκετο ἐν πάσῃ γῇ Ἰσραήλ, ὅτι εἶπον οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι, μὴ ποι-
20 ήσωσιν οἱ Ἑβραῖοι ῥομφαίαν καὶ δόρυ. Καὶ κατέβαινον πᾶς Ἰσ-
ραὴλ εἰς γῆν ἀλλοφύλων, χαλκεύειν ἕκαστος τὸ θεριστήριον αὑτοῦ
καὶ τὸ σκεῦος αὑτοῦ, καὶ ἕκαστος τὴν ἀξίνην αὑτοῦ καὶ τὸ δρέ-
21 πανον αὑτοῦ. Καὶ ἦν ὁ τρυγητὸς ἕτοιμος τοῦ θερίζειν· τὰ δὲ
σκευὴ ἦν τρεῖς σίκλοι εἰς τὸν ὀδόντα, καὶ τῇ ἀξίνῃ καὶ τῷ δρε-
22 πάνῳ ὑπόστασις ἦν ἡ αὐτή. Καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις τοῦ
πολέμου Μαχμάς, καὶ οὐχ εὑρέθη ῥομφαία καὶ δόρυ ἐν χειρὶ
παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ τοῦ μετὰ Σαοὺλ καὶ μετὰ Ἰωνάθαν καὶ εὑρέθη
23 τῷ Σαοὺλ καὶ τῷ Ἰωνάθαν υἱῷ αὑτοῦ. Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ἐξ ὑποστά-
σεως τῶν ἀλλοφύλων εἰς τὸ πέραν Μαχμάς.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΔ΄. XIV.

1 ΚΑΙ γίνεται ἡ ἡμέρα, καὶ εἶπεν Ἰωνάθαν υἱὸς Σαοὺλ τῷ
παιδαρίῳ τῷ αἴροντι τὰ σκεύη αὑτοῦ· δεῦρο καὶ διαβῶμεν εἰς
Μεσαὰβ τῶν ἀλλοφύλων τὴν ἐν τῷ πέραν ἐκείνῳ. Καὶ τῷ πατρὶ
2 αὑτοῦ οὐκ ἀπήγγειλε. Καὶ Σαοὺλ ἐκάθητο ἐπ᾿ ἄκρου τοῦ βουνοῦ
ὑπὸ τὴν ῥοὰν τὴν ἐν Μαγδῶν, καὶ ἦσαν μετ᾿ αὑτοῦ ὡς ἑξακόσιοι ἄνδρες.
3 Καὶ Ἀχιὰ υἱὸς Ἀχιτὼβ, ἀδελφοῦ Ἰωχαβὴδ, υἱοῦ Φινεὲς, υἱοῦ Ἤλει,

14 [which] the LORD commanded thee. For now would the LORD have established thy kingdom over Israel forever; but now thy kingdom shall not stand for thee. And the LORD shall seek for Himself a man after His own heart, and the LORD shall appoint him to be ruler over His people, because thou hast not kept whatsoever the LORD commanded thee.
15 And Samuel arose and departed from Gilgal. And the remnant of the people went up after Saul unto a meeting, behind the people of war, they themselves having come from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul mustered the people that were found with him, about six hundred men.
16 And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were found with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin and wept. And the Philistines had encamped in Michmash.
17 And spoilers came forth from the camp of the Philistines in three companies: the one company looked toward the way of Ophrah, unto the land of Shual;
18 And another company looked toward the way of Bethoron; and the third company looked toward the way of Geba, which dips down unto Gai and the desert plain of Zeboim.
19 Now there was no smith of iron found throughout all the land of Israel, for the Philistines had said, "Lest the Hebrews make swords and spears."
20 But all Israel went down to the land of the Philistines, each man to forge his reaping hook and his implement, and each man his axe and his pruning hook.
21 And the vintage was ready for reaping. And the charge for the tools was three shekels for the edge; and for the axe and for the pruning hook the standing-charge was the same.
22 And it came to pass in the days of the battle of Michmash, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and with Jonathan. But they were found with Saul and with Jonathan his son.
23 And a garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.

**CHAPTER 14**

1 Now it came to pass that day, that Jonathan, Saul's son, said unto the young man that carried his armor, "Come, and let us go over to the Philistine outpost that is on the other side." But to his father he told it not.
2 And Saul abode on the edge of the hill, under the pomegranate tree that was in Migron; and there were with him about six hundred men.
3 And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, brother of Jochabed, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, was the priest of God in Shiloh, wearing the Ephod.
