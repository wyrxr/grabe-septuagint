16 ἀδελφῷ μου, ὅτι παρὰ Κυρίου ἐγένετο αὐτῷ. Καὶ νῦν αἴτησιν μίαν
    ἐγὼ αἰτοῦμαι παρὰ σοῦ, μὴ ἀποστρέψῃς τὸ πρόσωπόν σου,
17 καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Βηθσαβεέ· λάλει. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ· εἶπον δὴ πρὸς
    Σαλωμὼν τὸν βασιλέα, ὅτι οὐκ ἀποστρέφει τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ
    ἀπὸ σοῦ, καὶ δώσει μοι τὴν Ἀβισὰγ τὴν Σουμανῖτιν εἰς γυναῖκα.
18 Καὶ εἶπε Βηθσαβεέ· καλῶς· ἐγὼ λαλήσω περὶ σοῦ τῷ βασιλεῖ.
19 Καὶ εἰσῆλθε Βηθσαβεὲ πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Σαλωμὼν λαλῆσαι αὐτῷ
    περὶ Ἀδωνίου. Καὶ ἐξανέστη ὁ βασιλεὺς εἰς ἀπάντησιν αὐτῇ, καὶ
    κατεφίλησεν αὐτήν, καὶ ἐκάθισεν ἐπὶ τοῦ θρόνου αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐτέθη
    θρόνος τῇ μητρὶ τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ ἐκάθισεν ἐκ δεξιῶν αὐτοῦ.
20 Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ· αἴτησιν μίαν μικρὰν ἐγὼ αἰτοῦμαι παρὰ σοῦ, μὴ
    ἀποστρέψῃς τὸ πρόσωπόν μου. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ ὁ βασιλεύς· αἴτησαι,
    μῆτερ ἐμή, ὅτι οὐκ ἀποστρέψω σε.
21 Καὶ εἶπε· δοθήτω δὴ Ἀβισὰγ ἡ Σουμανῖτις τῷ Ἀδωνία τῷ ἀδελφῷ
    σου εἰς γυναῖκα.
22 Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη ὁ βασιλεὺς Σαλωμών, καὶ εἶπε τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ· καὶ
    ἵνατί σὺ ᾔτησαι τὴν Ἀβισὰγ τὴν Σουμανῖτιν τῷ Ἀδωνίᾳ; καὶ
    αἴτησαι αὐτῷ τὴν βασιλείαν, ὅτι οὗτος ἀδελφός μου ὁ μέγας
    ὑπὲρ ἐμέ, καὶ αὐτῷ Ἀβιάθαρ ὁ ἱερεύς, καὶ αὐτῷ Ἰωὰβ ὁ υἱὸς
    Σαρουΐας, ὁ ἀρχιστράτηγος, ἑταῖρος.
23 Καὶ ὤμοσεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Σαλωμὼν κατὰ τοῦ Κυρίου, λέγων· τάδε
    ποιήσαι μοι ὁ Θεὸς καὶ τάδε προσθείη, ὅτι κατὰ τῆς ψυχῆς αὐτοῦ
    ἐλάλησεν Ἀδωνίας τὸν λόγον τοῦτον.
24 Καὶ νῦν ζῇ Κύριος ὃς ἡτοίμασέ με, καὶ ἔθετό με ἐπὶ τὸν θρόνον
    Δαυὶδ τοῦ πατρός μου, καὶ αὐτὸς ἐποίησέ μοι οἶκον καθὼς ἐλάλησε
    Κύριος, ὅτι σήμερον θανατωθήσεται Ἀδωνίας.
25 Καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Σαλωμὼν ἐν χειρὶ Βαναίου υἱοῦ
    Ἰωαδάε, καὶ ἀνεῖλεν αὐτόν, καὶ ἀπέθανεν Ἀδωνίας ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ
    ἐκείνῃ.
26 Καὶ τῷ Ἀβιάθαρ τῷ ἱερεῖ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεύς· εἰς Ἀναθὼθ ἀπότρεχε
    σὺ εἰς ἀγρόν σου, ὅτι ἀνὴρ θανάτου εἶ σὺ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ταύτῃ, καὶ
    οὐ θανατώσω σε, ὅτι ἦρας τὴν κιβωτὸν διαθήκης Κυρίου ἐνώπιον
    τοῦ πατρός μου, καὶ ὅτι ἐκακουχήθης ἐν πᾶσιν οἷς ἐκακουχήθη ὁ
    πατήρ μου.
27 Καὶ ἐξέβαλε Σαλωμὼν τὸν Ἀβιάθαρ τοῦ μὴ εἶναι ἱερέα τοῦ Κυρίου,
    πληρωθῆναι τὸ ῥῆμα Κυρίου ὃ ἐλάλησεν ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον Ἠλεὶ ἐν
    Σηλώμ.
28 Καὶ ἡ ἀκοὴ ἦλθεν ἕως Ἰωὰβ ὅτι Ἰωὰβ ἦν κεκληκὼς ὀπίσω Ἀδωνίου,
    καὶ ὀπίσω Ἀβεσσαλὼμ οὐκ ἔκλινε. Καὶ ἔφυγεν Ἰωὰβ εἰς τὸ
    σκήνωμα τοῦ Κυρίου, καὶ κατέσχε τῶν κεράτων τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου.
29 Καὶ ἀπηγγέλη τῷ Σαλωμῶν,

### A Royal Translation of the Third Book of Kingdoms, Chapter 2

**16** my brother; for from the LORD it came unto him. And now one petition I ask of thee, turn not away thy countenance,
**17** And Bathsheba said unto him, "Speak [thou]." And he said unto her, "Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, that he will not turn away his face from thee, and that he will give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife."
**18** And Bathsheba said, "It is well; I will speak for thee unto the king."
**19** And Bathsheba went in unto King Solomon, to speak unto him concerning Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and kissed her, and sat down on his throne; and a throne was set for the king's mother, and she sat on his right hand.
**20** And he said unto her, "I ask one small petition of thee; turn not away my countenance." And the king said unto her, "Ask, my mother, for I will not turn thee away."
**21** And she said, "Let Abishag the Shunammite now be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife."
**22** And King Solomon answered and said unto his mother, "And wherefore hast thou asked Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask for him the kingdom also; for he is my brother, the great one beyond me, and to him [is] Abiathar the priest, and to him [is] Joab the son of Zeruiah, the commander of the army, a companion."
**23** And King Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, "God do so to me, and more also, that Adonijah hath spoken this word against his own life.
**24** And now, as the LORD liveth, Who hath prepared me, and hath set me upon the throne of David my father, and Who hath made me an house as the LORD spake, surely Adonijah shall be put to death this day."
**25** And King Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and he slew him; and Adonijah died on that day.
**26** And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, "Go thou to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for a man of death art thou this day, yet I will not put thee to death, because thou didst bear the Ark of the Covenant of the LORD before my father, and because thou wast afflicted in all things wherein my father was afflicted."
**27** So Solomon cast out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD, that the word of the LORD might be fulfilled, which He spake upon the house of Eli in Shiloh.
**28** And the report came unto Joab, for Joab had called after Adonijah, but after Absalom he had not inclined. And Joab fled unto the Tabernacle of the LORD, and laid hold on the horns of the altar.
**29** And it was told unto Solomon,
