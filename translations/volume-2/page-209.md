**13** ραι καὶ ἀργυραῖ, ἦλοι, φιάλαι, καὶ σάλπιγγες, πᾶν σκεῦος χρυσοῦν, καὶ
σκεῦος ἀργυροῦν ἐκ τοῦ ἀργυρίου τοῦ εἰσενεχθέντος ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου,
ἔτι τοῖς ποιοῦσι τὰ ἔργα δώσουσιν αὐτό. καὶ ἐκραταίωσαν
**14** ἐν αὐτῷ τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου. Καὶ οὐκ ἐξελογίζοντο τοὺς ἄνδρας οἷς
ἐδίδουν τὸ ἀργύριον ἐπὶ χεῖρας αὐτῶν δοῦναι τοῖς ποιοῦσι τὰ ἔργα,
**15** ὅτι ἐν πίστει αὐτῶν ποιοῦσιν. Ἀργύριον περὶ ἁμαρτίας, καὶ ἀργύριον
περὶ πλημμελείας, (ὅτι) οὐκ εἰσηνέχθη ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου·
**16** τοῖς ἱερεῦσιν ἐγένετο. Τότε ἀνέβη Ἀζαὴλ βασιλεὺς Συρίας, καὶ
ἐπολέμησεν ἐπὶ Γέθ, καὶ προκατελάβετο αὐτήν· καὶ ἔταξεν Ἀζαὴλ
τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἀναβῆναι ἐπὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ.
**17** Καὶ ἔλαβεν Ἰωὰς βασιλεὺς Ἰούδα πάντα τὰ ἅγια ὅσα ἡγίασεν Ἰωσαφάτ,
καὶ Ἰωράμ, καὶ Ὀχοζίας, οἱ πατέρες αὐτοῦ, καὶ βασιλεῖς Ἰούδα,
καὶ τὰ ἅγια αὐτοῦ, καὶ πᾶν τὸ χρυσίον τὸ εὑρεθὲν ἐν θησαυροῖς οἴκου
Κυρίου, καὶ οἴκου τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ ἀπέστειλε τῷ Ἀζαὴλ βασιλεῖ
Συρίας, καὶ ἀνέβη ἀπὸ Ἱερουσαλήμ.
**18** Καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Ἰωάς, καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν, οὐκ ἰδοὺ
ταῦτα γεγραμμένα ἐπὶ βιβλίου λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν Ἰούδα;
**19** Καὶ ἀνέστησαν οἱ δοῦλοι αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔδησαν πάντα σύνδεσμον, καὶ
ἐπάταξαν τὸν Ἰωὰς ἐν οἴκῳ Μαλλά, καταβαίνοντα Σαλά.
**20** Καὶ Ἰωζαχὰρ υἱὸς Ἰεμουάθ, καὶ Ἰεζεβοὺθ υἱὸς (αὐτοῦ) Σωμήρ, οἱ δοῦλοι
αὐτοῦ ἐπάταξαν αὐτόν, καὶ ἀπέθανε, καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν μετὰ τῶν
**21** πατέρων αὐτοῦ ἐν πόλει Δαυίδ. καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Ἀμεσίας υἱὸς αὐτοῦ
ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΓ΄. ΧΙΙΙ.

**1** Ἐν ἔτει εἰκοστῷ καὶ τρίτῳ ἔτει Ἰωὰς υἱοῦ Ὀχοζίου βασιλέως
Ἰούδα ἐβασίλευσεν Ἰωάχαζ υἱὸς Ἰηοῦ ἐπὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ,
ἑπτακαίδεκα ἔτη.
**2** Καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ πονηρὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς Κυρίου, καὶ ἐπορεύθη ὀπίσω
ἁμαρτιῶν Ἱεροβοὰμ υἱοῦ Ναβὰτ ὃς ἐξήμαρτε τὸν Ἰσραήλ, οὐκ
ἀπέστη ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν.
**3** Καὶ ὠργίσθη θυμῷ Κύριος ἐν τῷ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτοὺς ἐν
χειρὶ Ἀζαὴλ βασιλέως Συρίας, καὶ ἐν χειρὶ υἱοῦ Ἄδερ υἱοῦ Ἀζαήλ,
πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας.
**4** Καὶ ἐδεήθη Ἰωάχαζ τοῦ προσώπου Κυρίου, καὶ ἐπήκουσεν αὐτοῦ
Κύριος, ὅτι εἶδε τὴν θλῖψιν Ἰσραήλ, ὅτι ἔθλιψεν αὐτοὺς βασιλεὺς
Συρίας.
**5** Καὶ ἔδωκε Κύριος σωτηρίαν τῷ Ἰσραήλ· καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ὑποκάτωθεν
χειρὸς Συρίας· καὶ ἐκάθισαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τοῖς σκη-

### CHAPTER XII

**13** doors, and silver [articles], nails, bowls, and trumpets—no vessel of gold, nor vessel of silver, [was made] from the money that was brought into the house of the LORD. Yet they gave it unto those who did the work;
**14** and by it did they strengthen the house of the LORD.
**15** And they did not reckon with the men into whose hands they delivered the silver to give unto those who did the work; for they acted in their faithfulness.
**16** The silver for the sin offering, and the silver for the trespass offering, (for) it was not brought into the house of the LORD; it belonged unto the priests.
**17** Then Hazael, king of Syria, went up, and he warred against Gath, and captured it. And Hazael set his face to go up against Jerusalem.
**18** And Joash, king of Judah, took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, and [other] kings of Judah, had consecrated; and his own hallowed things, and all the gold that was found in the treasuries of the house of the LORD, and of the house of the king; and he sent it unto Hazael, king of Syria. And he departed from Jerusalem.
**19** Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, behold, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
**20** And his servants arose, and they bound every bond [of conspiracy], and they struck Joash in the house of Millo, as he went down to Silla.
**21** And Jozachar, the son of Iemuath, and Jehozabad, the son [of his father] Shomer, his servants, struck him, and he died. And they buried him with his fathers in the City of David. And Amaziah, his son, reigned in his stead.

### CHAPTER XIII

**1** In the three and twentieth year of Joash, the son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, did Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, begin to reign over Israel in Samaria, for seventeen years.
**2** And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and he walked after the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin; he departed not from them.
**3** And the LORD was wroth with anger against Israel, and He delivered them into the hand of Hazael, king of Syria, and into the hand of the son of Ader, [even] the son of Hazael, all the days.
**4** And Jehoahaz supplicated the face of the LORD, and the LORD heard him; for He saw the affliction of Israel, for the king of Syria afflicted them.
**5** And the LORD gave salvation unto Israel; and they went forth from under the hand of Syria. And the sons of Israel sat in their [tents].
