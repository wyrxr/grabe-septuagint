ΚΕΦ. ΚΓ΄.
7 οὐχ᾽ πέπρακεν αὐτὸν ὁ Θεὸς εἰς χεῖράς μου, ὅτι ἀποκέκλεισται
8 εἰσελθὼν εἰς πόλιν θυρῶν καὶ μοχλῶν. Καὶ παρήγγειλε Σαοὺλ
   παντὶ τῷ λαῷ εἰς πόλεμον καταβαίνειν εἰς Κεειλὰ, συνέχειν τὸν
9 Δαυὶδ καὶ τοὺς ἄνδρας αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἔγνω Δαυίδ, ὅτι περὶ αὐτοῦ
   Σαοὺλ οὐ παρεσιώπα τὴν κακίαν· καὶ εἶπε Δαυὶδ πρὸς Ἀβιάθαρ τὸν
10 ἱερέα· προσάγαγε τὸ Ἐφούδ Κυρίου. Καὶ εἶπε Δαυίδ· Κύριε ὁ
   Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ, ἀκούων ἀκήκοεν ὁ δοῦλός σου, ὅτι ζητεῖ Σαοὺλ ἐλ-
11 θεῖν ἐπὶ Κεειλὰ διαφθεῖραι τὴν πόλιν δι᾽ ἐμέ· εἰ ἀποκλεισθήσεται;
   καὶ νῦν εἰ καταβήσεται Σαοὺλ καθὼς ἤκουσεν ὁ δοῦλός σου;
   Κύριε ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ ἀπάγγειλον τῷ δούλῳ σου. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος·
12 ἀποκλεισθήσεται. Καὶ εἶπε Δαυίδ· εἰ παραδώσουσιν οἱ παρὰ τῆς Κεειλὰ
   ἐμὲ καὶ τοὺς ἄνδρας μου εἰς χεῖρας Σαούλ; Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος· παρα-
13 δώσουσι. Καὶ ἀνέστη Δαυὶδ καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες οἱ μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ ὡς τετρακό-
   σιοι, καὶ ἐξῆλθον ἐκ Κεειλὰ, καὶ ἐπορεύοντο οὗ ἂν ἐπορεύθησαν.
   Καὶ τῷ Σαοὺλ ἀπηγγέλη, ὅτι διασέσωσται Δαυὶδ ἐκ Κεειλὰ, καὶ
14 ἀνῆκε τοῦ ἐξελθεῖν. Καὶ ἐκάθισεν Δαυὶδ ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ ἐν Μα-
   σερέθ ἐν τοῖς στενοῖς, καὶ ἐκάθητο ἐν τῷ ὄρει ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ Ζεὶφ,
   εἰς ὄρος τὸ αὐχμῶδες ἐν γῇ αὐχμώδει. Καὶ ἐζήτει αὐτὸν Σαοὺλ
   πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας, καὶ οὐ παρέδωκεν αὐτὸν Κύριος εἰς τὰς χεῖ-
15 ρας αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἴδε Δαυὶδ, ὅτι ἐξέρχεται Σαοὺλ τοῦ ζητεῖν τὸν
   Δαυίδ· καὶ Δαυὶδ ἐν τῷ ὄρει τῷ αὐχμώδει Ζεὶφ ἐν τῇ Καινῇ.
16 Καὶ ἀνέστη Ἰωνάθαν υἱὸς Σαοὺλ καὶ ἐπορεύθη πρὸς Δαυὶδ εἰς Καινὴν,
17 καὶ ἐκραταίωσε τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ ἐν Κυρίῳ. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὑτόν·
   μὴ φοβοῦ, ὅτι οὐ μὴ εὕρῃ σε ἡ χεὶρ Σαοὺλ τοῦ πατρός μου,
   καὶ σὺ βασιλεύσεις ἐπὶ Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ ἐγὼ ἔσομαί σοι εἰς δεύτερον,
18 καὶ Σαοὺλ ὁ πατήρ μου οἶδεν οὕτως. Καὶ διέθεντο ἀμφότεροι δια-
   θήκην ἐνώπιον Κυρίου. Καὶ Δαυὶδ ἐκάθητο ἐν Καινῇ, καὶ Ἰω-
19 νάθαν ἀπῆλθεν εἰς οἶκον αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἀνέβησαν οἱ Ζιφαῖοι ἐκ τῆς
   αὐχμώδους πρὸς Σαοὺλ ἐπὶ τὸν βουνὸν, λέγοντες· οὐχ ἰδοὺ Δαυὶδ
   κέκρυπται παρ᾽ ἡμῖν ἐν Μεσαρὰ ἐν τοῖς στενοῖς ἐν τῇ Καινῇ ἐν
20 τῷ βουνῷ τοῦ Ἐγελᾶ τοῦ ἐκ δεξιῶν τοῦ Ἰεσσαιμοῦ; Καὶ νῦν
   πᾶν τὸ πρὸς ψυχὴν τοῦ βασιλέως εἰς κατάβασιν, καταβαινέτω
   πρὸς ἡμᾶς· καὶ κεκλείκασιν αὐτὸν εἰς τὰς χεῖρας τοῦ βασιλέως.
21 Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς Σαούλ· εὐλογημένοι ὑμεῖς τῷ Κυρίῳ, ὅτι ἐπο-
22 νέσατε περὶ ἐμοῦ· πορεύθητε δὴ καὶ ἑτοιμάσατε ἔτι, καὶ γνῶτε
   καὶ ἴδετε τὸν τόπον αὐτοῦ οὗ ἔσται ὁ ποὺς αὐτοῦ ἐν τάχει ἐκεῖ

**CHAPTER 23.**

**7** Hath not God delivered him into my hands? For he is shut in, having entered a city of gates and bars.
**8** And Saul gave charge unto all the people to war, to go down into Keilah, to encompass David and his men.
**9** And David knew that concerning him Saul did not keep silent [his] malice. And David said unto Abiathar the priest, "Bring thou hither the ephod of the Lord."
**10** And David said, "O Lord, God of Israel, thy servant hath surely heard that Saul doth seek to come against Keilah, to utterly destroy the city because of me.
**11** Will it be shut up? And now, will Saul indeed come down, as thy servant hath heard? O Lord, God of Israel, declare [this] unto thy servant." And the Lord said,
**12** "[Yes,] it shall be shut up." And David said, "Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hands of Saul?" And the Lord said, "They will deliver [thee up]."
**13** Then David arose, and his men with him, about four hundred, and they went forth from Keilah, and went whithersoever they might go. And it was told unto Saul that David had escaped from Keilah, and he forbare to go forth.
**14** And David abode in the wilderness in Masareth, within the strongholds, and he dwelt in the mountain in the wilderness of Ziph, even unto the parched mountain in a parched land. And Saul sought him all the days, but the Lord did not deliver him into his hands.
**15** And David perceived that Saul was come forth to seek David; and David was in the parched mountain of Ziph, in Kainē.
**16** And Jonathan, the son of Saul, arose and went to David into Kainē, and he strengthened his hands in the Lord.
**17** And he said unto him, "Fear thou not, for the hand of Saul my father shall by no means find thee. And thou shalt reign over Israel, and I shall be unto thee as a second; and Saul my father knoweth this also."
**18** And they both made a covenant before the Lord. And David abode in Kainē, and Jonathan departed unto his own house.
**19** And the Ziphites went up from the barren land unto Saul, to the hill, saying, "Behold, is not David hidden with us in Messara, in the strongholds in Kainē, upon the hill of Hagilah, which is on the right hand of Jeshimon?
**20** And now, whatsoever the soul of the king doth desire for the descent, let him come down unto us; and they have enclosed him into the hands of the king."
**21** And Saul said unto them, "Blessed be ye of the Lord, for ye have taken pains on my behalf.
**22** Go now, and prepare yet further. And know ye and see his place, where his foot shall be quickly there, even where ye have said, lest he deal craftily."
