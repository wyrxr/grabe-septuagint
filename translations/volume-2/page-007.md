τὸν υἱὸν αὐτῆς, ἕως ἂν ἀπογαλακτίσῃ αὐτόν. Καὶ ἀνέβη μετ’ 24
αὐτοῦ εἰς Σηλὼ, ἡνίκα ἀπεγαλάκτισεν αὐτὸν, ἐν μόσχῳ τριετί-
ζοντι, καὶ ἄρτοις, καὶ οἴφι σεμιδάλεως, καὶ νέβελ οἴνου· καὶ εἰ-
σῆλθεν εἰς τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου Σηλὼ, καὶ τὸ παιδάριον μετ’ αὐ-
τῶν. Καὶ προσήγαγον αὐτὸν ἐνώπιον Κυρίου· καὶ ἔσφαξεν ὁ πα-
τὴρ αὐτοῦ τὴν θυσίαν ἣν ἐποίει ἐξ ἡμερῶν εἰς ἡμέρας τῷ Κυ-
ρίῳ, καὶ προσήγαγον τὸ παιδάριον. Καὶ ἔσφαξε τὸν μόσχον· καὶ 25
προσήγαγεν Ἄννα ἡ μήτηρ τὸ παιδάριον πρὸς Ἠλεὶ, καὶ εἶπεν· 26
ἐν ἐμοὶ κύριε· Ζῇ ἡ ψυχή σου, κύριέ μου, ἐγὼ ἡ γυνὴ ἡ κατα-
στᾶσα ἐνώπιόν σου ἐν τούτῳ, προσεύξασθαι πρὸς Κύριον· ὑπὲρ 27
τοῦ παιδαρίου τούτου προσηυξάμην, καὶ ἔδωκε Κύριός μοι τὸ αἴ-
τημά μου ὃ ᾐτησάμην παρ’ αὐτοῦ· κἀγὼ κίχρω αὐτὸν τῷ Κυρίῳ 28
πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας ἃς ζῇ αὐτὸς, χρῆσιν τῷ Κυρίῳ. Καὶ προσε-
κύνησεν ἐκεῖ τῷ Κυρίῳ.

ΚΕΦ. Β´. ΙΙ.

ΚΑΙ προσηύξατο Ἄννα, καὶ εἶπεν· ἐστερεώθη ἡ καρδία μου 1
ἐν Κυρίῳ, ὑψώθη κέρας μου ἐν Θεῷ μου· ἐπλατύνθη τὸ στόμα
μου ἐπ’ ἐχθρούς μου, ὅτι ηὐφράνθην ἐν σωτηρίᾳ σου. Οὐκ ἔστιν 2
ἅγιος ὡς Κύριος, καὶ οὐκ ἔστι πλὴν σοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἔστι δίκαιος
ὡς ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν. Μὴ καυχᾶσθε, καὶ μὴ λαλεῖτε ὑψηλὰ εἰς ὑπε- 3
ροχήν· μὴ ἐξελθάτω μεγαλοῤῥημοσύνη ἐκ τοῦ στόματος ὑμῶν· ὅτι
Θεὸς γνώσεων Κύριος, καὶ Θεὸς ἑτοιμάζων ἐπιτηδεύματα αὐτοῦ·
Τόξον δυνατῶν ἠσθένησε, καὶ ἀσθενοῦντες περιεζώσαντο δύναμιν· 4
πλήρεις ἄρτων ἠλαττώθησαν, καὶ οἱ πεινῶντες παρῆκαν γῆν· ὅτι 5
στεῖρα ἔτεκεν ἑπτά, καὶ ἡ πολλὴ ἐν τέκνοις ἠσθένησε. Κύριος 6
θανατοῖ καὶ ζωογονεῖ, κατάγει εἰς ᾅδου καὶ ἀνάγει· Κύριος πτω- 7
χίζει καὶ πλουτίζει, ταπεινοῖ καὶ ἀνυψοῖ. Ἀνιστᾷ ἀπὸ γῆς πένη- 8
τα, καὶ ἀπὸ κοπρίας ἐγείρει πτωχὸν, τοῦ καθίσαι αὐτὸν μετὰ δυ-
ναστῶν λαοῦ, καὶ θρόνον δόξης κατακληρονομῶν αὐτοῖς. Διδοὺς εὐ- 9
χὴν τῷ εὐχομένῳ· καὶ εὐλόγησεν ἔτη δικαίων, ὅτι οὐκ ἐν ἰσχύϊ
δυνατὸς ἀνήρ. Κύριος ἀσθενῆ ποιήσει ἀντίδικον αὐτοῦ· Κύριος 10
ἅγιος. Μὴ καυχάσθω ὁ φρόνιμος ἐν τῇ φρονήσει αὐτοῦ, καὶ μὴ
καυχάσθω ὁ δυνατὸς ἐν τῇ δυνάμει αὐτοῦ, καὶ μὴ καυχάσθω ὁ
πλούσιος ἐν τῷ πλούτῳ αὐτοῦ· ἀλλ’ ἢ ἐν τούτῳ καυχάσθω ὁ καυ-
χώμενος, συνιεῖν καὶ γινώσκειν τὸν Κύριον, καὶ ποιεῖν κρῖμα καὶ
δικαιοσύνην ἐν μέσῳ τῆς γῆς. Κύριος ἀνέβη εἰς οὐρανούς, καὶ ἐ-
βρόντησεν· αὐτὸς κρινεῖ ἄκρα γῆς, καὶ δίδωσιν ἰσχὺν τοῖς βασι-
λεῦσιν ἡμῶν, καὶ ὑψώσει κέρας χριστοῦ αὐτοῦ.

**First [Book] of Kingdoms**
**Chapter 1**

23 ...her son, until she should wean him.
24 And she went up with him to Shiloh, when she had weaned him, with a three-year-old calf, and with loaves [of bread], and with an ephah of fine flour, and with a bottle of wine. And she entered into the house of the Lord in Shiloh, and the child was with them. And they brought him before the Lord; and his father slew the sacrifice which he offered from days to days unto the Lord, and they brought the child.
25 And he slew the calf;
26 and Anna his mother brought the child unto Eli, and said, "By my life, my lord! As thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman who stood before thee in this place, to pray unto the Lord.
27 For this child I prayed; and the Lord hath given me my petition which I asked of Him.
28 And I lend him unto the Lord all the days that he liveth, for use unto the Lord." And he worshipped there before the Lord.

**Chapter 2**

1 And Anna prayed, and said:
"My heart is established in the Lord,
my horn is exalted in my God;
my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies,
for I have rejoiced in thy salvation.
2 There is none holy as the Lord,
and there is none beside Thee,
and there is none righteous as our God.
3 Boast not, neither speak ye high things unto arrogance;
let no boastful speech proceed out of your mouth.
For the Lord is a God of knowledge,
and a God preparing His own devices.
4 The bow of the mighty is made weak,
and they that were feeble have girded themselves with strength.
5 They that were full of bread are diminished,
and the hungry have forsaken the land;
for the barren hath borne seven,
and she that was full of children is made weak.
6 The Lord killeth and maketh alive;
He bringeth down to Hades and bringeth up.
7 The Lord maketh poor and maketh rich;
He humbleth and lifteth up.
8 He raiseth up the poor from the earth,
and from the dunghill lifteth up the needy,
to make him sit among the rulers of the people,
and maketh them to inherit a throne of glory.
9 Granting the prayer to him that prayeth;
and He hath blessed the years of the righteous,
for not by strength shall man prevail.
10 The Lord shall make his adversary weak;
the Lord is holy.
Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom,
neither let the mighty man boast in his might,
neither let the rich man boast in his riches;
but in this let him that boasteth boast:
that he understand and know the Lord,
and do judgment and righteousness in the midst of the earth.
The Lord hath ascended into the heavens, and hath thundered;
He Himself shall judge the ends of the earth,
and giveth strength unto our kings,
and shall exalt the horn of His Christ."
