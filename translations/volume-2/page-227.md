ἀναβαθμούς; Καὶ εἶπεν Ἑζεκίας· κοῦφον τὴν σκιὰν κλῖναι δέκα
ἀναβαθμούς· οὐχί, ἀλλὰ ἐπιστραφήτω ἡ σκιὰ δέκα ἀναβαθμοὺς
εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω. Καὶ ἐδέησεν Ἠσαΐας ὁ προφήτης πρὸς Κύριον, 11
καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν ἡ σκιὰ ἐν τοῖς ἀναβαθμοῖς οἷς κατέβη ἐν ἀνα-
βαθμοῖς Ἄχαζ, εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω δέκα βαθμούς. Ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ 12
ἀπέστειλεν Μερωδὰχ Βαλαδάν, υἱὸς Βαλαδάν, βασιλεὺς Βαβυ-
λῶνος, βιβλία καὶ μαναὰ πρὸς Ἑζεκίαν, ὅτι ἤκουσεν ὅτι ἠρρώ-
στησεν Ἑζεκίας. Καὶ ἐχάρη ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῖς Ἑζεκίας, καὶ ἔδειξεν 13
αὐτοῖς ὅλον τὸν οἶκον τοῦ νεχωθὰ, τὸ ἀργύριον, καὶ τὸ χρυ-
σίον, καὶ τὰ ἀρώματα, καὶ τὸ ἔλαιον τὸ ἀγαθὸν, καὶ τὸν οἶκον
τῶν σκευῶν, καὶ ὅσα ηὑρέθη ἐν τοῖς θησαυροῖς αὐτοῦ· οὐκ ἦν
λόγος, ὃν οὐκ ἔδειξεν αὐτοῖς Ἑζεκίας ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐν
πάσῃ τῇ ἐξουσίᾳ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἰσῆλθεν Ἠσαΐας ὁ προφήτης 14
πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα Ἑζεκίαν, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτόν· τί ἐλάλησαν οἱ
ἄνδρες οὗτοι, καὶ πόθεν ἥκασι πρὸς σέ; Καὶ εἶπεν Ἑζεκίας· ἐκ
γῆς πόρρωθεν ἥκασι πρὸς μὲ ἐκ Βαβυλῶνος. Καὶ εἶπε· τί εἶδον 15
ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ σου; Καὶ εἶπεν Ἑζεκίας· πάντα ὅσα ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ
μου ἴδον, οὐκ ἦν ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ μου, ὃ οὐκ ἔδειξα αὐτοῖς, ἀλλὰ
καὶ ἐν τοῖς θησαυροῖς μου. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἠσαΐας πρὸς Ἑζεκίαν· 16
ἄκουσον τὸν λόγον Κυρίου· ἰδοὺ ἡμέραι ἔρχονται, καὶ ληφθήσε- 17
ται πάντα τὰ ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ σου, καὶ ὅσα ἐθησαύρισαν οἱ πατέ-
ρές σου, ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης, εἰς Βαβυλῶνα· καὶ οὐχ ὑπο-
λειφθήσεται ρῆμα ὃ εἶπεν ὁ Κύριος· καὶ οἱ υἱοί σου, οἱ ἐξελεύ- 18
σονται ἐκ σοῦ, οὓς γεννήσεις, λήψεται, καὶ ἔσονται εὐνοῦχοι ἐν
τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ βασιλέως Βαβυλῶνος. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἑζεκίας πρὸς 19
Ἠσαΐαν· ἀγαθὸς ὁ λόγος Κυρίου ὃν ἐλάλησε. καὶ εἶπε· μὴ οὐκ,
ἐὰν εἰρήνη καὶ ἀλήθεια ἔσται ἐν ἡμέραις μου; Καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ 20
τῶν λόγων Ἑζεκίου, καὶ πᾶσα ἡ δυναστεία αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὅσα
ἐποίησε, τὴν κρήνην, καὶ τὸν ὑδραγωγὸν, καὶ εἰσήνεγκε τὸ ὕδωρ
εἰς τὴν πόλιν, οὐχὶ ταῦτα γεγραμμένα ἐπὶ βιβλίῳ λόγων τῶν
ἡμερῶν τοῖς βασιλεῦσιν Ἰούδα; Καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Ἑζεκίας μετὰ 21
τῶν πατέρων αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐβασίλευσε Μανασσῆς υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀντ᾿
αὐτοῦ.

### 2 Kings 20

**10** degrees?" And Hezekiah said, "It is a light thing for the shadow to decline ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow return ten degrees backward."
**11** And Isaiah the prophet made his prayer unto the LORD, and He caused the shadow to return, on the degrees where it had descended, even on the degrees of Ahaz, ten degrees backward.
**12** In that time, Merodach-Baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and mana [gifts] unto Hezekiah, for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.
**13** And Hezekiah rejoiced at them, and showed them all the house of the *nechotha* [storehouse of precious things]: the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the good oil, and the house of the vessels, and all that was found in his treasures. There was no thing which Hezekiah showed them not in his house, and in all his dominion.
**14** Then Isaiah the prophet came unto King Hezekiah, and said unto him, "What spake these men? And from whence came they unto thee?" And Hezekiah said, "From a far country have they come unto me, even from Babylon."
**15** And he said, "What have they seen in thine house?" And Hezekiah answered, "All things that are in my house have they seen; there was nothing in my house which I showed them not; yea, and in my treasures also."
**16** And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, "Hearken unto the word of the LORD:
**17** Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and all that thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried unto Babylon; and there shall not be left a word which the LORD hath spoken.
**18** And of thy sons, which shall come forth from thee, whom thou shalt beget, shall they take them away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon."
**19** Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, "Good is the word of the LORD which He hath spoken." And he said, "Is it not good, if peace and truth be in my days?"
**20** And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and all that he did — the pool, and the conduit, and how he brought the water into the city — are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
**21** And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.
