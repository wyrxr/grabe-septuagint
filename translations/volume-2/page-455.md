εἰς γῆν τὰ ὠὰ αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐπὶ χοῦν θάλψει· καὶ ἐπελάθετο ὅτι 15
ποὺς σκορπιεῖ αὐτά, καὶ θηρία ἀγροῦ καταπατήσει αὐτά. Ἀπεσκλήρυνε 16
τὰ τέκνα αὐτῆς ὥστε μὴ ἑαυτῇ, εἰς κενὸν ἐκοπίασεν
ἄνευ φόβου· ὅτι κατεσιώπησεν αὐτῇ ὁ Θεὸς σοφίαν, καὶ οὐκ ἐμέρισεν 17
αὐτῇ (ὁ Θεὸς) ἐν τῇ συνέσει. Κατὰ καιρὸν ἐν ὕψει ὑψώσει, 18
καταγελάσεται ἵππῳ καὶ τοῦ ἐπιβάτου αὐτοῦ. Ἡ σὺ περιέθηκας 19
ἵππῳ δύναμιν, καὶ ἐνέδυσας τραχήλῳ αὐτοῦ φόβον; Περιέθηκας 20
δὲ αὐτῷ πανοπλίαν, καὶ δόξῃ στηθέων αὐτοῦ τόλμην; Ἀνορύσσων 21
ἐν πεδίῳ γαυριᾷ, ἐκπορεύεται δὲ εἰς πεδίον ἐν ἰσχύϊ· συναντῶν
βέλει καταγελᾷ, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἀποστραφῇ σιδήρου. Ἐπ᾽ αὐτῷ γαυ- 22
ριᾷ τόξον καὶ ὀξυσθενὴς μάχαιρα· καὶ ὀργῇ ἀφανιεῖ τὴν γῆν. Καὶ 24
οὐ μὴ πιστεύσει ἕως ἂν σημάνῃ σάλπιγξ· σάλπιγγος δὲ σημαινούσης, 25
ἐρεῖ· εὖγε. Πόῤῥωθεν δὲ ὀσφραίνεται πολέμου, (καὶ) σὺν
ἀλαλάγματι καὶ κραυγῇ (ἐκπορεύεται). Ἐκ δὲ τῆς σῆς ἐπισήμης 26
ἔπτηκεν ἵεραξ, ἀναπετάσας τὰς πτέρυγας ἀκίνητος, καθορῶν τὰ
πρὸς νότον; Ἢ ἐπὶ τῷ σῷ προστάγματι ὑψοῦται ἀετός; γῦψ δὲ 27
ἐπὶ νοσσιᾶς αὐτοῦ καθεσθεὶς αὐλίζεται ἐπ᾿ ἐξοχῇ πέτρας καὶ ἀπο- 28
κρύφῳ; Ἐκεῖσε ὧν ζητεῖ τὰ σῖτα· πόῤῥωθεν (δὲ) οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτοῦ 29
σκοπεύουσι. Νεοσσοὶ δὲ αὐτοῦ φύρονται ἐν αἵματι· οἳ δὲ ἐὰν 30
ὦσι τεθνεῶτες, παραχρῆμα εὑρίσκονται. Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Κύριος ὁ 31
Θεὸς τῷ Ἰώβ, καὶ εἶπε· μὴ κρίσιν μετὰ ἱκανοῦ ἐκκλινεῖ; ἐλέγξῃ 32
Θεόν, ἀποκριθήσεται αὐτήν; Ὑπολαβὼν δὲ Ἰώβ, εἶπε τῷ Κυρίῳ· 33
τί ἔτι ἐγὼ κρίνομαι, νουθετούμενος καὶ ἐλεγχόμενος ὑπὸ Κυρίου, 34
ἀκούων τοιαῦτα; μηδὲν ὧν ἐγώ, ἀπόκρισιν δὲ τίνα δῶ πρὸς ταῦτα;
χεῖρα θήσω ἐπὶ στόματί μου· ἅπαξ ἐλάλησα, ἐπὶ δὲ τῷ 35
δευτέρῳ οὐ προσθήσω.

Ἔτι δὲ ὑπολαβὼν ὁ Κύριος, εἶπε τῷ Ἰὼβ διὰ τοῦ νέφους· 1
μή, ἀλλὰ ζῶσαι ὥσπερ ἀνὴρ τὴν ὀσφῦν σου· ἐρωτήσω δέ σοι, σὺ 2
δὲ μοι ἀποκρίθητι. Μὴ ἀποποιῆ μου τὸ κρίμα; οἴει δέ με ἄλλως 3

## CHAPTER XXXIX.

**15** She abandoneth her eggs upon the earth, and in the dust she doth warm them; and she forgetteth that a foot may scatter them, or that the beasts of the field may tread them down.
**16** She hardeneth herself against her young, as though they were not hers; in vain she hath labored without fear;
**17** For God hath withheld wisdom from her, and God hath not imparted unto her [any portion] in understanding.
**18** At such time as she lifteth herself up on high, she shall mock the horse and his rider.
**19** Hast thou clothed the horse with strength, and hast thou clad his neck with fear?
**20** And hast thou girded him with full armor, and [endued] his breast with glorious boldness?
**21** He diggeth in the plain and exulteth, and he goeth forth into the plain in his might; he doth mock at the dart when he meeteth it, and he turneth not back from the iron.
**22** Against him the bow doth exult, and the sharp-pointed sword; and with wrath shall he make the earth to vanish.
**24** And he will not be persuaded [to cease], until the trumpet doth sound;
**25** And when the trumpet soundeth, he saith, 'Aha!' Yea, from afar he scenteth the battle, and with a war-cry and a shout doth he sally forth.
**26** Is it by thy mark that the hawk doth take flight, spreading his wings motionless, and discerning the things toward the south?
**27** Or doth the eagle mount up at thy command? And doth the vulture, settling upon his nest, lodge himself upon a craggy height and a hidden rock?
**28** Thence, therefore, he seeketh his food;
**29** And from afar his eyes do scan [all things].
**30** His young ones do wallow in blood; and if they be dead, straightway are they found.
**31** Then the Lord God answered Job, and said:
**32** Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty decline [His] judgment? He that doth reprove God, shall he answer Him?
**33** Then Job answered the Lord, and said:
**34** What more shall I be judged? Being admonished and reproved by the Lord, hearing such things; I am as nothing, wherefore what answer shall I give unto these?
**35** I will lay my hand upon my mouth. Once have I spoken, but unto a second [time] I shall not add [a word].

## CHAPTER XL.

**1** Moreover, the Lord answered Job again, [speaking] from the cloud, and said:
**2** Nay, but gird up thy loins like a man; I will question thee, and do thou make answer unto Me.
**3** Wilt thou indeed disallow My judgment? And dost thou deem that I have dealt with thee otherwise, save that thou mightest appear righteous?
**4** Hath thine arm indeed the power of the Lord? Or dost thou thunder with a voice [of thunder] like unto His?
**5** Assume then height and power; clothe thyself with glory and with honor.
**6** Then send forth thy messengers in thine anger, and humble every arrogant one;
