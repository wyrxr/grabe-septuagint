33 βασιλέων Ἰούδα καὶ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Ἑζεκίας μετὰ τῶν πατέρων ἑαυτοῦ, καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν ἐν ἀναβάσει τάφων υἱῶν Δαυΐδ· καὶ δόξαν καὶ τιμὴν ἔδωκαν αὐτῷ ἐν τῷ θανάτῳ αὐτοῦ πᾶς Ἰούδα, καὶ οἱ κατοικοῦντες ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ ἐβασίλευσε Μανασσῆς υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. ΛΓ΄. XXXIII.

1 Ὤν δέκα καὶ δύο ἐτῶν Μανασσῆς ἐν τῷ βασιλεῦσαι αὐτόν, καὶ πεντηκονταπέντε ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ.
2 Καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ πονηρὸν ἐνώπιον Κυρίου ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν βδελυγμάτων τῶν ἐθνῶν,
3 ὃς ἐξωλόθρευσε Κύριος ἀπὸ προσώπου τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἐπέστρεψε, καὶ ᾠκοδόμησε τὰ ὑψηλά, ἃ κατέσπασεν Ἑζεκίας ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔστησε στήλας ταῖς Βααλείμ, καὶ ἐποίησεν ἄλση, καὶ προσεκύνησε πάσῃ τῇ στρατιᾷ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ ἐδούλευσεν αὐτοῖς·
4 καὶ ᾠκοδόμησε θυσιαστήρια ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου, οὗ εἶπε Κύριος,
5 ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἔσται τὸ ὄνομά μου εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα· καὶ ᾠκοδόμησε θυσιαστήρια πάσῃ τῇ στρατιᾷ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, ἐν ταῖς δυσὶν αὐλαῖς οἴκου Κυρίου.
6 Καὶ αὐτὸς δίηγε τὰ τέκνα αὐτοῦ ἐν πυρὶ ἐν Γῇ Βενεννόμ· καὶ ἐκληδονίζετο, καὶ οἰωνίζετο, καὶ ἐφαρμακεύετο, καὶ ἐποίησεν ἐγγαστριμύθους, καὶ ἐπαοιδοὺς ἐπλήθυνε, τοῦ ποιῆσαι τὸ πονηρὸν ἐναντίον Κυρίου τοῦ παροργίσαι αὐτόν·
7 καὶ ἔθηκε τὸ γλυπτὸν, καὶ τὸ χωνευτὸν, εἰκόνα ἣν ἐποίησεν ἐν οἴκῳ Θεοῦ, οὗ εἶπεν ὁ Θεὸς πρὸς Δαυΐδ, καὶ πρὸς Σαλωμὼν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ, ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τούτῳ, καὶ Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἣν ἐξελεξάμην ἐκ πασῶν φυλῶν Ἰσραὴλ, θήσω τὸ ὄνομά μου εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα.
8 Καὶ οὐ προθήσω σαλεῦσαι τὸν πόδα Ἰσραὴλ ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς ἧς ἔδωκα τοῖς πατράσιν αὐτῶν, πλὴν ἐὰν φυλάσσωνται τοῦ ποιῆσαι πάντα ἃ ἐνετειλάμην αὐτοῖς κατὰ πάντα τὸν νόμον, καὶ τὰ προστάγματα, καὶ τὰ κρίματα, καὶ δικαιώματα ἐν χειρὶ Μωϋσῆ.
9 Καὶ ἐπλάνησε Μανασσῆς τὸν Ἰούδαν, καὶ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, τοῦ ποιῆσαι τὸ πονηρὸν ὑπὲρ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη ἃ ἐξῆρε Κύριος ἀπὸ προσώπου τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ.
10 Καὶ ἐλάλησε Κύριος ἐπὶ Μανασσῆ, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἤκουσαν.
11 Καὶ ἤγαγε Κύριος ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς τοὺς ἄρχοντας τῆς δυνάμεως τοῦ βασιλέως Ἀσσούρ, καὶ κατέλαβον τὸν Μανασσῆ ἐν δεσμοῖς, καὶ ἔδησαν αὐτὸν ἐν πέδαις, καὶ

**Translation:**

**Chapter 32**
³³...of the kings of Judah and Israel. And Hezekiah slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David. And all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor and glory in his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.

**Chapter 33**
¹ Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem.
² And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all the abominations of the nations,
³ whom the Lord had cast out from before the children of Israel. For he turned back and built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down; and he set up altars for the Baalim, and made Asherah poles, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.
⁴ Also he built altars in the house of the Lord, of which the Lord had said,
⁵ "In Jerusalem shall My Name be for ever." And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord.
⁶ Moreover he caused his children to pass through the fire in the Valley of Ben-Hinnom; also he practised divination, and used enchantments, and sorcery, and appointed those that had familiar spirits, and multiplied wizards, to do much evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke Him to anger.
⁷ And he set a graven image, and a molten image, [even] the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David, and to Solomon his son, "In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put My Name for ever.
⁸ Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of the land which I have given to their fathers, provided that they be careful to do all things which I have commanded them, according to all the law, and the commandments, and the judgments, and the statutes by the hand of Moses."
⁹ So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err, to do evil more than all the nations whom the Lord had destroyed from before the children of Israel.
¹⁰ And the Lord spake to Manasseh, and to his people, but they would not hearken.
¹¹ Therefore the Lord brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Asshur, who took Manasseh with chains, and bound him with fetters, and [brought him to Babylon].
