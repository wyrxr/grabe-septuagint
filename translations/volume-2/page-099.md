ἐπιστρέψῃς, καὶ ἐρεῖς τῷ ᾿Αβεσσαλώμ· διεληλύθασιν οἱ ἀδελφοί
σου· καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς κατόπισθέν μου καὶ ἐλήλυθεν ὁ πατήρ σου·
καὶ νῦν παῖς σου εἰμί, βασιλεῦ, ἔασόν με ζῆσαι· παῖς τοῦ πα-
τρός σου ἤμην τότε καὶ ἀρτίως, καὶ νῦν ἐγὼ δοῦλός σου, καὶ δια-
σκεδάσω μοι τὴν βουλὴν ᾿Αχιτόφελ. Καὶ ἰδοὺ μετὰ σοῦ ἐκεῖ 35
Σαδδὼκ καὶ ᾿Αβιάθαρ, οἱ ἱερεῖς. Καὶ ἔσται πᾶν ῥῆμα ὃ ἐὰν ἀ-
κούσῃς ἐξ οἴκου τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ ἀναγγελεῖς τῷ Σαδδώκ, καὶ
τῷ ᾿Αβιάθαρ, τοῖς ἱερεῦσιν. ᾿Ιδοὺ ἐκεῖ μετ᾿ αὐτῶν δύο υἱοὶ αὐ- 36
τῶν, ᾿Αχιμάας υἱὸς τῷ Σαδδώκ, καὶ ᾿Ιωνάθαν υἱὸς τῷ ᾿Αβιάθαρ.
Καὶ ἀποστελεῖτε ἐν χειρὶ αὐτῶν πρός με πᾶν ῥῆμα ὃ ἐὰν ἀκού-
σητε. Καὶ εἰσῆλθε Χουσὶ ὁ ἀρχιεταῖρος Δαυὶδ εἰς τὴν πόλιν , 37
καὶ ᾿Αβεσσαλὼμ ἐπορεύετο εἰς τὴν πόλιν ᾿Ιερουσαλήμ.

ΚΕΦ. ΙϚ΄.

ΚΑΙ Δαυὶδ παρῆλθε βραχὺ τι ἀπὸ τῆς Ῥῶς, καὶ ἰδοὺ Σιβὰ 1
τὸ παιδάριον Μεμφιβοσθαὶ εἰς ἀπάντησιν αὐτοῦ· καὶ ζεῦγος ὄνων
ἐπισεσαγμένων, καὶ ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῖς διακόσιοι ἄρτοι, καὶ ἑκατὸν στα-
φίδες, καὶ ἑκατὸν φοίνικες, καὶ νέβελ οἴνου. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασι- 2
λεὺς πρὸς Σιβά· τί ταῦτά σοι; καὶ εἶπε Σιβά· τὰ ὑποζύγια τῇ
οἰκίᾳ τοῦ βασιλέως τοῦ ἐπικαθῆσθαι, καὶ οἱ ἄρτοι καὶ οἱ φοίνικες
εἰς βρῶσιν τοῖς παιδαρίοις, καὶ ὁ οἶνος πιεῖν τοῖς ἐκλελυμένοις
ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς· καὶ ποῦ ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ κυρί- 3
ου σου; καὶ εἶπε Σιβὰ πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα· ἰδοὺ κάθηται ἐν Ἱερου-
σαλήμ, ὅτι εἶπε· σήμερον ἐπιστρέψουσί μοι ὁ οἶκος ᾿Ισραὴλ τὴν
βασιλείαν τοῦ πατρός μου. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τῷ Σιβᾷ· ἰδοὺ 4
σοι πάντα ὅσα ἐστὶ Μεμφιβοσθαί. Καὶ εἶπε Σιβὰ προσκυνήσας·
εὕροιμι χάριν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς σου, κύριέ μου βασιλεῦ. Καὶ ἦλθεν ὁ 5
βασιλεὺς Δαυὶδ ἕως Βχουρίμ. Καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐκεῖθεν ἀνὴρ ἐξεπορεύετο
ἐκ συγγενείας οἴκου Σαούλ, καὶ ὄνομα αὐτῷ Σεμεΐ, υἱὸς Ἰηρά·
6 ἐξῆλθεν ἐκπορευόμενος, καὶ καταρώμενος, καὶ λιθάζων ἐν λίθοις
τὸν Δαυίδ, καὶ πάντας τοὺς παῖδας τοῦ βασιλέως Δαυίδ. Καὶ πᾶς
ὁ λαός, καὶ πάντες οἱ δυνατοὶ ἐκ δεξιῶν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐξ εὐωνύμων
τοῦ βασιλέως. Καὶ οὕτως ἔλεγε Σεμεΐ ἐν τῷ καταρᾶσθαι αὐτόν· 7
ἔξελθε ἔξελθε ἀνὴρ αἱμάτων καὶ ἀνὴρ ὁ παράνομος. ᾿Επέστρεψε 8
Κύριος ἐπὶ σὲ πάντα τὰ αἵματα τοῦ οἴκου Σαούλ, ἔτι ἐβασίλευ-

**15:34** ...but if thou return unto the city, then shalt thou say unto Absalom, "Thy brethren have passed over; and the king [David is] behind me, and thy father [Absalom] is come; and now, O king, thy servant am I; let me live! A servant of thy father was I then and even now, and now I am thy slave; and I shall scatter for thee the counsel of Ahithophel."
**35** And behold, there with thee [are] Zadok and Abiathar, the priests. And it shall be, that every word which thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt declare unto Zadok, and unto Abiathar, the priests.
**36** Behold, there with them [are] their two sons, Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar. And ye shall send by their hand unto me every word whatsoever ye shall hear.
**37** So Hushai, David's chief friend, came into the city; and Absalom was entering into the city of Jerusalem.

**CHAPTER 16**

**1** AND when David had passed a little way from the summit, behold, Ziba, the servant of Mephibosheth, came to meet him, with a pair of saddled donkeys, and upon them two hundred loaves, and an hundred cakes of raisins, and an hundred dates, and a flask of wine.
**2** And the king said unto Ziba, "What meanest thou by these?" And Ziba answered, "The beasts of burden are for the household of the king, that they may ride thereon; and the loaves and the dates are for the young men to eat; and the wine is for those who are faint in the wilderness to drink."
**3** And the king said, "And where is the son of thy master?" And Ziba said unto the king, "Behold, he abideth in Jerusalem, for he said, 'Today shall the house of Israel restore unto me the kingdom of my father.'"
**4** Then said the king unto Ziba, "Behold, thine are all things whatsoever belong to Mephibosheth." And Ziba bowed himself down and said, "May I find grace in thy sight, O my lord the king!"
**5** And when King David came as far as Bahurim, behold, there came out thence a man of the kindred of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera;
**6** He came forth, still going on and cursing, and casting stones at David, and at all the servants of King David. And all the people, and all the mighty men, were on his right hand and on his left hand of the king.
**7** And thus said Shimei when he cursed him, "Get thee out, get thee out, O man of blood, and O lawless man!
**8** The Lord hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, because thou didst reign in his stead;
