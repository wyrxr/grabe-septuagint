ΚΕΦ. ΚΗ´. ΤΩΝ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ ΙΟΥΔΑ Β. 809

ΚΕΦ. ΚΗ´. XXVIII.

1  ὝΙΟΣ εἴκοσι ἐτῶν Ἄχαζ ἐν τῷ βασιλεῦσαι αὐτόν, καὶ δε-
   καὲξ ἔτη ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ· καὶ οὐκ ἐποίησε τὸ εὐθὲς ἐνώ-
   πιον Κυρίου ὡς Δαυὶδ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ.
2  Καὶ ἐπορεύθη κατὰ τὰς ὁδοὺς τῶν βασιλέων Ἰσραήλ· καὶ γὰρ
   γλυπτὰ ἐποίησε, καὶ τοῖς εἰδώλοις αὐτῶν ἔθυεν ἐν Γῇ Βενεννόμ·
3  καὶ διῆγε τὰ τέκνα αὐτοῦ διὰ πυρὸς κατὰ τὰ βδελύγματα πάντων
   τῶν ἐθνῶν (τῶν ἀπεριτμήτων τούτων, καὶ) ὧν ἐξωλέθρευσε Κύριος ἀπὸ
   προσώπου τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ.
4  Καὶ ἐθυμία ἐπὶ τῶν ὑψηλῶν, καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν δωμάτων, καὶ ὑποκάτω
   παντὸς ξύλου ἀλσώδους.
5  Καὶ παρέδωκεν αὐτὸν Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς αὐτοῦ διὰ χειρὸς βασιλέως
   Συρίας, καὶ ἐπάταξεν ἐν αὐτῷ, καὶ ἠχμαλώτευσεν ἐξ αὐτῶν αἰχμαλωσίαν
   πολλήν, καὶ ἤγαγεν εἰς Δαμασκόν, καὶ εἰς τὰς χεῖρας βασιλέως
   Ἰσραὴλ παρέδωκαν αὐτόν, καὶ ἐπάταξεν ἐν αὐτῷ πληγὴν μεγάλην.
6  Καὶ ἀπέκτεινε Φακεὲ ὁ τοῦ Ῥομελίου βασιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ ἐν Ἰούδα
   ἐν μιᾷ ἡμέρᾳ ἑκατὸν εἴκοσι χιλιάδας ἀνδρῶν δυνατῶν ἰσχύϊ, ἐν τῷ
   αὐτοὺς καταλιπεῖν τὸν Κύριον Θεὸν τῶν πατέρων ἑαυτῶν.
7  Καὶ ἀπέκτεινε Ζεχρὶ ὁ δυνατὸς τοῦ Ἐφραὶμ τὸν Μαασίαν τὸν
   υἱὸν τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ τὸν Ἐζρικὰν ἡγούμενον τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ,
   καὶ τὸν Ἑλκανὰ τὸν διάδοχον τοῦ βασιλέως.
8  Καὶ ἠχμαλώτευσαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἀπὸ τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτῶν
   τριακοσίας χιλιάδας, γυναῖκας, υἱοὺς καὶ θυγατέρας· καὶ σκῦλα πολλὰ
   ἐσκύλευσαν ἐξ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἤνεγκαν τὰ σκῦλα εἰς Σαμάρειαν.
9  Καὶ ἐκεῖ ἦν ὁ προφήτης τοῦ Κυρίου, Ὠδὴδ ὄνομα αὐτῷ· καὶ
   ἐξῆλθεν εἰς ἀπάντησιν τῆς δυνάμεως τῶν ἐρχομένων εἰς Σαμάρειαν,
   καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· ἰδοὺ ὀργὴ Κυρίου Θεοῦ τῶν πατέρων ὑμῶν ἐπὶ
   τὸν Ἰούδαν, καὶ παρέδωκεν αὐτοὺς εἰς τὰς χεῖρας ὑμῶν, καὶ
   ἀπεκτείνατε ἐν αὐτοῖς ἐν ὀργῇ, καὶ ἕως τῶν οὐρανῶν ἔφθασε.
10 Καὶ νῦν υἱοὺς Ἰούδα καὶ Ἱερουσαλὴμ ὑμεῖς λέγετε κατακτήσεσθαι
   εἰς δούλους καὶ δούλας. οὐκ ἰδοὺ εἰμι μεθ᾽ ὑμῶν μαρτυρῆσαι Κυρίῳ
   τῷ Θεῷ ὑμῶν;
11 Καὶ νῦν ἀκούσατέ μου, καὶ ἀποστρέψατε τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν ἣν
   ἠχμαλωτεύσατε τῶν ἀδελφῶν ὑμῶν, ὅτι ὀργὴ θυμοῦ Κυρίου ἐφ᾽ ὑμῖν.
12 Καὶ ἀνέστησαν ἄρχοντες ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν Ἐφραίμ, Ἀζαρίας ὁ τοῦ
   Ἰωναν, καὶ Βαραχίας ὁ τοῦ Μοσολλαμὼθ, καὶ Ἐζεκίας ὁ τοῦ
   Σελλήμ, καὶ Ἀμα-

### English Translation

#### CHAPTER XXVIII.

¹ Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and sixteen years reigned he in Jerusalem; and he did not that which was right in the sight of the Lord, as David his father.
² For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel; yea, he made molten images, and sacrificed unto their idols in the Valley of Ben-Hinnom.
³ And he caused his children to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of all the nations (even of these uncircumcised ones), whom the Lord had destroyed from before the face of the children of Israel.
⁴ And he offered incense upon the high places, and upon the rooftops, and under every green tree.
⁵ Wherefore the Lord his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and he smote him, and carried away from them a great multitude of captives, and brought them to Damascus. And [Ahaz] was delivered into the hands of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter.
⁶ For Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, slew in Judah in one day a hundred and twenty thousand valiant men of strength, because they had forsaken the Lord God of their fathers.
⁷ And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's son, and Ezrikam, the governor of his house, and Elkanah, who was next in rank to the king.
⁸ And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren three hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters; and they took much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.
⁹ Now there was there a prophet of the Lord, named Oded; and he went forth to meet the army that came to Samaria, and said unto them, "Behold, because the wrath of the Lord God of your fathers was upon Judah, He hath delivered them into your hand; and ye have slain them in a rage that reacheth up to the heavens.
¹⁰ And now ye purpose to subdue the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen. Are there not now with you [sins] to bear witness unto the Lord your God?
¹¹ Now therefore hear me, and restore the captives whom ye have taken of your brethren; for the fierce wrath of the Lord is upon you."
¹² Then certain of the chief men of the children of Ephraim rose up—Azariah the son of Johanan, and Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Ama-
