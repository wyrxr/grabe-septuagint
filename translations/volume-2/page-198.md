674 ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Δ΄. ΚΕΦ. Ζ΄. Η΄.
θεισθαι αὐτούς· καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν οἱ ἄγγελοι, καὶ ἀνήγγειλαν τῷ βασιλεῖ.
16 Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ὁ λαός, καὶ διήρπασαν τὴν παρεμβολὴν Συρίας. καὶ ἐγένετο μέτρον σεμιδάλεως σίκλου, καὶ δίμετρον κριθῶν σίκλου, κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα Κυρίου. Καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς κατέστησε τὸν τριστάτην, ἐφ’ ὃν ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐπαναπαύετο ἐπὶ τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ, ἐπὶ τῆς πύλης· καὶ συνεπάτησεν αὐτὸν ὁ λαὸς ἐπὶ τῆς πύλης· καὶ ἀπέθανε, καθὼς ἐλάλησεν ὁ ἄνθρωπος τοῦ Θεοῦ, ὃς ἐλάλησεν ἐν τῷ καταβῆναι
17 τὸν ἄγγελον πρὸς αὐτόν. Καὶ ἐγένετο καθὼς ἐλάλησεν ᾿Ελισσαῖ πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα, λέγων· δίμετρον κριθῆς σίκλου, καὶ μέτρον σεμιδάλεως σίκλου· καὶ ἔσται ὡς ἡ ὥρα αὕτη αὔριον ἐν τῇ πύλῃ Σαμαρείας.
18 Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη ὁ τριστάτης τῷ ᾿Ελισσαῖε, καὶ εἶπεν· ἰδοὺ Κύριος ποιεῖ καταράκτας ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ, μὴ ἔσται τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο; καὶ εἶπεν ᾿Ελισσαῖε· ἰδοὺ ὄψῃ τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς σου, καὶ ἐκεῖθεν οὐ φάγῃ.
19 Καὶ ἐγένετο αὐτῷ οὕτως· καὶ συνεπάτησαν αὐτὸν ὁ λαὸς ἐν τῇ πύλῃ· καὶ ἀπέθανε.

ΚΕΦ. Η΄. VIII.

1 ΚΑΙ ᾿Ελισσαῖ ἐλάλησε πρὸς τὴν γυναῖκα ἧς ἐζωπύρησε τὸν υἱόν, λέγων· ἀνάστηθι, καὶ δεῦρο σύ, καὶ ὁ οἶκός σου, καὶ παροίκει οὗ ἐὰν παροικήσῃς, ὅτι κέκληκε Κύριος λιμὸν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, καί γε
2 ἦλθεν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ἑπτὰ ἔτη. Καὶ ἀνέστη ἡ γυνή, καὶ ἐποίησε κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα ᾿Ελισσαῖ, καὶ ἐπορεύθη αὕτη, καὶ ὁ οἶκος αὐτῆς, καὶ παρῴκει ἐν γῇ ἀλλοφύλων ἑπτὰ ἔτη.
3 Καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ τὸ τέλος τῶν ἑπτὰ ἐτῶν, καὶ ἐπέστρεφεν ἡ γυνὴ ἐκ γῆς τῶν ἀλλοφύλων, καὶ ἦλθε βοῆσαι πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα περὶ τοῦ οἴκου αὐτῆς,
4 καὶ περὶ τῶν ἀγρῶν ἑαυτῆς. Καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐλάλησε πρὸς Γιεζεὶ τὸ παιδάριον ᾿Ελισσαῖε τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τοῦ Θεοῦ, λέγων· διήγησαι δὴ μοι πάντα τὰ μεγάλα ἃ ἐποίησεν ᾿Ελισσαῖε.
5 Καὶ ἐγένετο αὐτοῦ ἐξηγουμένου τῷ βασιλεῖ, ὡς ἐζωπύρησεν υἱὸν τεθνηκότα, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἡ γυνὴ ἧς ἐζωπύρησε τὸν υἱὸν αὐτῆς ᾿Ελισσαῖε, βοῶσα πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα περὶ τοῦ οἴκου ἑαυτῆς, καὶ περὶ τῶν ἀγρῶν ἑαυτῆς· καὶ εἶπε Γιεζεί, κύριε βασιλεῦ, αὕτη ἡ γυνή, καὶ οὗτος υἱὸς αὐτῆς ὃν ἐζωπύρησεν ᾿Ελισσαῖε.
6 Καὶ ἐπηρώτησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τὴν γυναῖκα· καὶ διηγήσατο αὐτῷ. καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῇ ὁ βασιλεὺς εὐνοῦχον ἕνα, λέγων· ἐπίστρεφον πάντα τὰ αὐτῆς, καὶ πάντα τὰ γεννήματα τοῦ ἀγροῦ,

**CHAPTER SEVEN.**

**15** ...in their dismay. And the messengers returned, and told the king.
**16** And the people went out, and spoiled the camp of Syria. And a measure of fine flour was [sold for] a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the Lord. And the king had appointed the lord, upon whose hand the king leaned, at the gate; and the people trod him down at the gate; and he died, according as the man of God had spoken, who had spoken when the messenger came down unto him.
**17** And it came to pass, as Elisha had spoken unto the king, saying, "Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be at this hour tomorrow in the gate of Samaria."
**18** And the lord had answered Elisha, and said, "Behold, if the Lord would make windows in heaven, might this thing be?" And Elisha had said, "Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof."
**19** And so it came to pass unto him; for the people trod him down in the gate, and he died.

**CHAPTER EIGHT.**

**1** Now Elisha had spoken unto the woman whose son he had brought back to life, saying, "Arise, and go thou and thy household, and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn, for the Lord hath called for a famine upon the land, and verily it
**2** is come upon the land for seven years." And the woman arose, and did according to the word of Elisha; and she went, she and her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.
**3** And it came to pass after the end of seven years, that the woman returned from the land of the Philistines, and she came to cry unto the king concerning her house,
**4** and concerning her fields. And the king spoke unto Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, saying, "Tell me now all the great things that Elisha hath done."
**5** And it came to pass, as he was recounting unto the king how he had revived a dead son, and behold, the selfsame woman whose son Elisha had brought to life, was crying out unto the king concerning her house, and concerning her fields. And Gehazi said, "My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha did restore to life."
**6** And the king asked the woman; and she recounted it unto him. And the king gave unto her a certain eunuch, saying, "Restore all that is hers, and all the produce of the field,
