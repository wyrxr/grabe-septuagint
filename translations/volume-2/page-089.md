13 Καὶ εἶπε Δαυὶδ τῷ Νάθαν· ἡμάρτηκα τῷ Κυρίῳ. Καὶ εἶπε Νάθαν
  πρὸς Δαυίδ· καὶ Κύριος παρεβίβασε τὸ ἁμάρτημά σου, οὐ μὴ
  ἀποθάνῃς.
14 Πλὴν ὅτι παροξύνων παρώξυνας τοὺς ἐχθροὺς τοῦ Κυρίου ἐν τῷ
  ῥήματι τούτῳ, καί γε ὁ υἱός σου ὁ τεχθείς σοι θανάτῳ ἀποθανεῖται.
15 Καὶ ἀπῆλθε Νάθαν εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἔθραυσε Κύριος
  τὸ παιδάριον ὃ ἔτεκεν ἡ γυνὴ Οὐρίου τῷ Δαυίδ, καὶ ἠῤῥώστησε.
16 Καὶ ἐζήτησε Δαυὶδ τὸν Θεὸν περὶ τοῦ παιδαρίου, καὶ ἐνήστευσε
  Δαυὶδ νηστείαν, καὶ εἰσῆλθε, καὶ ηὐλίσθη, καὶ ἐκοιμήθη ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς.
17 Καὶ ἀνέστησαν οἱ πρεσβύτεροι τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν τοῦ
  ἐγεῖραι αὐτὸν ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς, καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησε, καὶ οὐ συνέφαγεν
  αὐτοῖς ἄρτον.
18 Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ, καὶ ἀπέθανε τὸ παιδάριον.
  Καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν οἱ δοῦλοι Δαυὶδ ἀναγγεῖλαι αὐτῷ, ὅτι τέθνηκε
  τὸ παιδάριον, ὅτι εἶπαν· ἰδοὺ ἐν τῷ ἔτι ζῆν τὸ παιδάριον ἐλαλή-
  σαμεν πρὸς αὐτόν, καὶ οὐκ εἰσήκουσε τῆς φωνῆς ἡμῶν, καὶ πῶς
  εἴπωμεν πρὸς αὐτόν, ὅτι τέθνηκε τὸ παιδάριον, καὶ ποιήσει κακά;
19 Καὶ συνῆκε Δαυὶδ ὅτι οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ ψιθυρίζουσι, καὶ ἐνόησε
  Δαυὶδ ὅτι τέθνηκε τὸ παιδάριον. Καὶ εἶπε Δαυὶδ πρὸς τοὺς παῖδας
  αὐτοῦ· εἰ τέθνηκε τὸ παιδάριον; Καὶ εἶπαν· τέθνηκε.
20 Καὶ ἀνέστη Δαυὶδ ἐκ τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἐλούσατο, καὶ ἠλείψατο, καὶ
  ἤλλαξε τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Θεοῦ,
  καὶ προσεκύνησεν αὐτῷ· καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ· καὶ
  ἤτησεν ἄρτον φαγεῖν, καὶ παρέθηκαν αὐτῷ ἄρτον, καὶ ἔφαγε.
21 Καὶ εἶπαν οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ πρὸς αὐτόν· τί τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο ὃ
  ἐποίησας ἕνεκεν τοῦ παιδαρίου; ὅτι ζῶντος ἐνήστευες, καὶ ἔκλαιες,
  καὶ ἠγρύπνεις, καὶ ἡνίκα ἀπέθανε τὸ παιδάριον, ἀνέστης, καὶ
  ἔφαγες ἄρτον, καὶ πέπωκας;
22 Καὶ εἶπε Δαυίδ· ἐν τῷ τὸ παιδάριον ἔτι ζῆν ἐνήστευσα, καὶ ἔκλαυσα,
  ὅτι εἶπα· τίς οἶδεν εἰ ἐλεήσει με Κύριος, καὶ ζήσεται τὸ παιδάριον;
23 Καὶ νῦν τέθνηκε τὸ παιδάριον, ἵνατί τοῦτο ἐγὼ νηστεύω; μὴ δυ-
  νήσομαι ἐπιστρέψαι αὐτὸ ἔτι; ἐγὼ πορεύσομαι πρὸς αὐτόν, καὶ
  αὐτὸς οὐκ ἀναστρέψει πρός με.
24 Καὶ παρεκάλεσε Δαυὶδ τὴν Βηθσαβεὲ γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἰσῆλθε
  πρὸς αὐτήν, καὶ ἐκοιμήθη μετ᾿ αὐτῆς, καὶ συνέλαβε, καὶ ἔτεκεν
  υἱόν, καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Σαλωμών· καὶ Κύριος ἠγάπησεν
  αὐτόν.
25 Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ἐν χειρὶ Νάθαν τοῦ προφήτου, καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸ
  ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ἰεδιδία, ἕνεκεν Κυρίου.

### Chapter 12

**13** And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.
**14** Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast greatly provoked the enemies of the LORD, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die.
**15** And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it fell sore sick.
**16** David therefore besought God for the child; and David did fast a fast, and went in, and lay prostrate, and slept upon the earth.
**17** And the elders of his house arose unto him, to raise him up from the earth; but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.
**18** And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, Behold, whilst the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice; how then shall we tell him that the child is dead, and he will do much evil?
**19** But when David perceived that his servants whispered, David understood that the child was dead; and David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they answered, He is dead.
**20** Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel, and went into the house of God, and worshipped Him; then he came to his own house; and he asked for bread to eat, and they set bread before him, and he did eat.
**21** Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou hast done concerning the child? for whilst it was yet alive, thou didst fast, and weep, and keep vigil; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise up, and eat bread, and drink?
**22** And David said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted, and I wept; for I said, Who knoweth whether the LORD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?
**23** But now the child is dead, wherefore should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.
**24** And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her; and she conceived, and bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him.
**25** And [the LORD] sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.
