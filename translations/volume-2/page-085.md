πον καὶ ἐκ τοῦ ὄπισθεν, καὶ ἐπέλεξεν ἐκ πάντων νεανιῶν Ἰσραήλ,
καὶ παρετάξαντο ἐξ ἐναντίας Συρίας. Καὶ τὸ κατάλοιπον τοῦ λαοῦ 10
ἔδωκεν ἐν χειρὶ Ἀβισαὶ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ παρετάξαντο ἐξ
ἐναντίας υἱῶν Ἀμμών, καὶ εἶπεν· ἐὰν κραταιωθῇ Συρία ὑπὲρ ἐμέ, 11
καὶ ἔσεσθέ μοι εἰς σωτηρίαν· καὶ ἐὰν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἀμμὼν κραταιωθῶσιν
ὑπὲρ σέ, καὶ ἐσόμεθα τοῦ σῶσαί σε. Ἀνδρίζου, καὶ κραταιωθῶμεν 12
ὑπὲρ τοῦ λαοῦ ἡμῶν καὶ περὶ τῶν πόλεων τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν, καὶ
Κύριος ποιήσει τὸ ἀγαθὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτοῦ. Καὶ προσῆλθεν 13
Ἰωὰβ καὶ ὁ λαὸς ὁ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ εἰς πόλεμον πρὸς Συρίαν, καὶ
ἔφυγον ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ Συρία. Καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Ἀμμὼν εἶδον 14
ὅτι ἔφυγε Συρία, καὶ ἔφυγον ἀπὸ προσώπου Ἀβισαί, καὶ εἰσῆλθαν
εἰς τὴν πόλιν. Καὶ ἀνέστρεψεν Ἰωὰβ ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν Ἀμμών,
καὶ παρεγένετο εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ εἶδε Συρία ὅτι ἔπταισεν ἔμ- 15
προσθεν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ συνήχθησαν ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό. Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν 16
Ἀδρααζάρ, καὶ συνήγαγε τὴν Συρίαν τὴν ἐκ τοῦ πέραν τοῦ πο-
ταμοῦ, καὶ παρεγένοντο εἰς Αἰλάμ· καὶ Σωβὰκ ἄρχων τῆς δυ-
νάμεως Ἀδρααζὰρ ἔμπροσθεν αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἀπηγγέλθη τῷ Δαυΐδ, 17
καὶ συνήγαγε τὸν πάντα Ἰσραήλ, καὶ διέβη τὸν Ἰορδάνην, καὶ πα-
ρεγένετο εἰς Αἰλάμ. Καὶ παρετάξατο Συρία κατέναντι Δαυΐδ,
καὶ ἐπολέμησαν μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἔφυγε Συρία ἀπὸ προσώπου 18
Ἰσραὴλ καὶ ἀνεῖλε Δαυΐδ ἐκ τῆς Συρίας ἑπτακόσια ἅρματα, καὶ
τεσσαράκοντα χιλιάδας ἱππέων· καὶ τὸν Σωβὰκ τὸν ἄρχοντα τῆς
δυνάμεως αὐτοῦ ἐπάταξε, καὶ ἀπέθανεν ἐκεῖ. Καὶ εἶδαν πάν- 19
τες οἱ βασιλεῖς οἱ δοῦλοι Ἀδρααζάρ, ὅτι ἔπταισαν ἔμπροσθεν Ἰσ-
ραήλ, καὶ ηὐτομόλησαν μετὰ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐδούλευσαν αὐτοῖς. Καὶ
ἐφοβήθη Συρία τοῦ σῶσαι ἔτι τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἀμμών.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΑ΄.

**1** ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο ἐπιστρέψαντος τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ εἰς τὸν καιρὸν τῆς
ἐξοδίας τῶν βασιλέων, καὶ ἀπέστειλε Δαυΐδ τὸν Ἰωάβ, καὶ τοὺς
παῖδας αὐτοῦ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὸν ἅπαντα Ἰσραήλ· καὶ διέφθει-
ραν τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἀμμὼν καὶ ἐκάθισαν ἐπὶ Ῥαββάθ. Καὶ Δαυΐδ
ἐκάθισεν ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ ἐγένετο πρὸς ἑσπέραν, καὶ ἀνέστη 2
Δαυΐδ ἀπὸ τῆς κοίτης αὐτοῦ, καὶ περιεπάτει ἐπὶ τοῦ δώματος τοῦ
οἴκου τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ εἶδε γυναῖκα λουομένην ἀπὸ τοῦ δώμα-

### Chapter 10

**9** …the face of the battle was against him, from before and from behind. And he chose from all the young men of Israel, and they put themselves in array against Syria.
**10** And the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and they put themselves in array against the children of Ammon.
**11** And Joab said, If Syria prove too strong for me, then shall ye be [unto] me for deliverance; and if the children of Ammon prove too strong for thee, then will we be [there] to save thee.
**12** Be of good courage, and let us be valiant for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the LORD shall do that which seemeth good in His eyes.
**13** So Joab, and the people that were with him, drew nigh unto the battle against Syria: and Syria fled before him.
**14** And when the children of Ammon saw that Syria was fled, they fled also before Abishai, and entered into the city. So Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.
**15** And when Syria saw that they were smitten before Israel, they gathered themselves together.
**16** And Hadadezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river; and they came to Ailam. And Shobach the captain of the host of Hadadezer went before them.
**17** And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and passed over Jordan, and came to Ailam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.
**18** And Syria fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven hundred chariots and forty thousand horsemen: and Shobach the captain of his host he smote, and he died there.
**19** And when all the kings that were servants to Hadadezer saw that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more.

### Chapter 11

**1** And it came to pass, at the return of the year, at the time when kings go forth [to battle], that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbath. But David tarried still at Jerusalem.
**2** And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king’s house: and from the roof he saw a woman bathing.
