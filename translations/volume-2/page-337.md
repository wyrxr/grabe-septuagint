²⁶ καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς ταῖς σάλπιγξι. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἑζεκίας ἀνενέγκαι τὴν ὁλο-
²⁷ καύτωσιν ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον· καὶ ἐν τῷ ἄρξασθαι ἀναφέρειν τὴν
ὁλοκαύτωσιν, ἤρξαντο ᾄδειν τῷ Κυρίῳ, καὶ αἱ σάλπιγγες πρὸς τὰ
ὄργανα Δαυὶδ βασιλέως Ἰσραήλ. ²⁸ Καὶ πᾶσα ἡ ἐκκλησία προσεκύ-
νει, καὶ οἱ ψαλτῳδοὶ ᾄδοντες, καὶ αἱ σάλπιγγες σαλπίζουσαι ἕως
οὗ συνετελέσθη ἡ ὁλοκαύτωσις. ²⁹ Καὶ ὡς συνετέλεσαν ἀναφέροντες,
(καὶ) ἔκαμψεν ὁ βασιλεύς, καὶ πάντες οἱ εὑρεθέντες, καὶ προσεκύ-
νησαν. ³⁰ Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἑζεκίας καὶ πάντες οἱ ἄρχοντες τοῖς
Λευΐταις, ὑμνεῖν τὸν Κύριον ἐν λόγοις Δαυὶδ καὶ Ἀσὰφ τοῦ προ-
φήτου· καὶ ὕμνουν ἐν εὐφροσύνῃ, καὶ ἔπεσαν καὶ προσεκύνησαν.
³¹ Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Ἑζεκίας, καὶ εἶπε· νῦν ἐπληρώσατε τὰς χεῖρας ὑμῶν
Κυρίῳ, προσαγάγετε, καὶ φέρετε θυσίας, καὶ αἰνέσεως εἰς οἶκον Κυ-
ρίου. Καὶ ἀνήνεγκεν ἡ ἐκκλησία θυσίας, καὶ αἰνέσεις εἰς οἶκον Κυ-
ρίου, καὶ πᾶς πρόθυμος τῇ καρδίᾳ ὁλοκαυτώσεις. ³² Καὶ ἐγένετο ὁ ἀρι-
θμὸς τῆς ὁλοκαυτώσεως ἧς ἀνήνεγκεν ἡ ἐκκλησία, μόσχοι ἑβδομή-
κοντα, κριοὶ ἑκατόν, ἀμνοὶ διακόσιοι, εἰς ὁλοκαύτωσιν Κυρίῳ πάντα
ταῦτα· ³³ καὶ οἱ ἡγιασμένοι μόσχοι ἑξακόσιοι, πρόβατα τρισχίλια·
³⁴ ἀλλ᾿ ἢ οἱ ἱερεῖς ὀλίγοι ἦσαν, καὶ οὐκ ἠδύναντο δεῖραι τὴν ὁλοκαύ-
τωσιν, καὶ ἀντελάβοντο αὐτῶν οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτῶν οἱ Λευΐται, ἕως οὗ
συνετελέσθη τὸ ἔργον, καὶ ἕως οὗ ἡγνίσθησαν οἱ ἱερεῖς, ὅτι οἱ Λευ-
ΐται ἡγνίσθησαν προθύμως παρὰ τοὺς ἱερεῖς. ³⁵ Καὶ ἡ ὁλοκαύτωσις
πολλὴ ἐν τοῖς στέασι τῆς τελειώσεως τοῦ σωτηρίου, καὶ τῶν σπον-
δῶν τῆς ὁλοκαυτώσεως· καὶ κατωρθώθη τὸ ἔργον ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου.
³⁶ Καὶ ηὐφράνθη Ἑζεκίας καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαός, διὰ τὸ ἡτοιμακέναι τὸν
Θεὸν τῷ λαῷ, ὅτι ἐξάπινα ἐγένετο ὁ λόγος.

¹ ΚΑΙ ἀπέστειλεν Ἑζεκίας ἐπὶ πάντα Ἰσραὴλ καὶ Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐπι-
στολὰς ἔγραψεν ἐπὶ τὸν Ἐφραὶμ καὶ Μανασσῆ ἐλθεῖν εἰς οἶκον Κυ-
ρίου εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ, ποιῆσαι τὸ Φασὲκ τῷ Κυρίῳ Θεῷ Ἰσραήλ.
² Καὶ ἐβουλεύσατο ὁ βασιλεύς, καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες, καὶ πᾶσα ἡ ἐκκλησία
ἡ ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ, ποιῆσαι τὸ Φασὲκ τῷ μηνὶ τῷ δευτέρῳ· ³ οὐ γὰρ
ἐδυνάσθησαν ποιῆσαι αὐτὸ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ, ὅτι οἱ ἱερεῖς οὐχ
ἡγνίσθησαν ἱκανοί, καὶ ὁ λαὸς οὐ συνήχθη εἰς Ἱερου-

### English Translation

### Chapter 29

²⁶ And the priests with the trumpets.

²⁷ And Hezekiah said, "[Let them] offer up the burnt offering upon the altar." And when they began to offer up the burnt offering, they began to sing unto the Lord, and the trumpets sounded with the instruments of David the king of Israel.

²⁸ And all the congregation prostrated themselves, and the singers singing, and the trumpets sounding, until the burnt offering was finished.

²⁹ And as they had finished offering, and the king bowed himself down, and all that were found, and they worshipped.

³⁰ And King Hezekiah and all the princes said unto the Levites, to hymn the Lord in the words of David and Asaph the prophet. And they hymned with joy, and fell down and worshipped.

³¹ And Hezekiah answered and said, "Now have ye consecrated your hands unto the Lord. Come ye near, and bring sacrifices, and thank offerings into the house of the Lord." And the congregation brought forth sacrifices, and thank offerings into the house of the Lord, and every one that was of a willing heart, [brought] burnt offerings.

³² And the number of the burnt offering which the congregation did bring was seventy bullocks, an hundred rams, [and] two hundred lambs: all these for a burnt offering unto the Lord.

³³ And the sanctified bullocks were six hundred, and sheep three thousand.

³⁴ But the priests were few, and could not flay the burnt offering; therefore their brethren the Levites did help them, until the work was ended, and until the priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites were more willing to sanctify themselves than were the priests.

³⁵ And the burnt offering was in great abundance, with the fats of the perfecting of the salvific sacrifice, and with the drink offerings of the burnt offering. And the work was rightly accomplished in the house of the Lord.

³⁶ And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, because God had prepared the people; for suddenly the matter was brought to pass.

### Chapter 30

¹ And Hezekiah sent [messengers] unto all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters unto Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come unto the house of the Lord at Jerusalem, to keep the Passover unto the Lord God of Israel.

² And the king, and his princes, and all the congregation that were in Jerusalem, consulted to keep the Passover in the second month.

³ For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither were the people gathered together to Jerusalem.
