πλοῦτον, καὶ δόξαν, καὶ χρήματα δώσω σοι, ὡς (σὺ) οὐκ ἐγενήθη
ὅμοιός σοι ἐν τοῖς βασιλεῦσι τοῖς ἔμπροσθέν σου, καὶ μετὰ σὲ οὐκ
ἔσται οὕτως. Καὶ ἦλθε Σαλωμὼν ἐκ Βαμὰ τῆς ἐν Γαβαὼν εἰς Ἰε- ¹³
ρουσαλὴμ ἀπὸ προσώπου τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου, καὶ ἐβασίλευ-
σεν ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ συνήγαγε Σαλωμὼν ἅρματα καὶ ἱππεῖς, ¹⁴
καὶ ἐγένοντο αὐτῷ χίλια καὶ τετρακόσια ἅρματα, καὶ δώδεκα χι-
λιάδες ἱππέων• καὶ κατέλιπεν αὐτὰ ἐν πόλεσι τῶν ἁρμάτων, καὶ
ὁ λαὸς μετὰ τοῦ βασιλέως ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ. Καὶ ἔθηκεν ὁ βασιλεὺς ¹⁵
τὸ χρυσίον καὶ τὸ ἀργύριον ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ ὡς λίθους, καὶ τὰς κέ-
δρους ἐν τῇ Ἰουδαίᾳ ὡς συκαμίνους τὰς ἐν τῇ πεδινῇ εἰς πλῆθος.
Καὶ ἡ ἔξοδος τῶν ἵππων τῶν Σαλωμὼν ἐξ Αἰγύπτου, καὶ ἡ τιμὴ ¹⁶
τῶν ἐμπόρων τοῦ βασιλέως πορεύεσθαι, ἠγόραζον. Καὶ ἀνέβαινον, ¹⁷
καὶ ἐξῆγον ἐξ Αἰγύπτου ἅρμα ἓν ἑξακοσίων ἀργυρίου, καὶ ἵππον
ἑκατὸν καὶ πεντήκοντα• καὶ οὕτως πᾶσι τοῖς βασιλεῦσι τῶν Χετ-
ταίων, καὶ βασιλεῦσι Συρίας ἐν χερσὶν αὐτῶν ἔφερον.

ΚΕΦ. Β´. ΙΙ.

ΚΑὶ εἶπε Σαλωμὼν τοῦ οἰκοδομῆσαι οἶκον τῷ ὀνόματι Κυ- ¹
ρίου, καὶ οἶκον τῇ βασιλείᾳ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ συνήγαγε Σαλωμὼν ἑβ- ²
δομήκοντα χιλιάδας ἀνδρῶν νωτοφόρων, καὶ ὀγδοήκοντα χιλιά-
δας λατόμων ἐν τῷ ὄρει, καὶ οἱ ἐπιστάται ἐπ’ αὐτῶν τρισχίλιοι
ἑξακόσιοι. Καὶ ἀπέστειλε Σαλωμὼν πρὸς Χειρὰμ βασιλέα Τύρου, ³
λέγων• ὡς ἐποίησας μετὰ τοῦ πατρός μου Δαυίδ, καὶ ἀπέστειλας
αὐτῷ κέδρους τοῦ οἰκοδομῆσαι ἑαυτῷ οἶκον κατοικῆσαι ἐν αὐτῷ,
καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ οἰκοδομῶ οἶκον τῷ ὀνόματι Κυρίου Θεοῦ ⁴
μου, ἁγιάσαι αὐτὸν αὐτῷ τοῦ θυμιᾷν ἀπέναντι αὐτοῦ θυμίαμα καὶ
πρόθεσιν διαπαντός, καὶ τοῦ ἀναφέρειν ὁλοκαυτώματα διαπαντὸς,
τοῦ πρωῒ καὶ τοῦ δείλης, καὶ ἐν τοῖς σαββάτοις, καὶ ἐν ταῖς νεομη-
νίαις, καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἑορταῖς Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα
ἐπὶ τὸν Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ὁ οἶκος ὃν ἐγὼ οἰκοδομῶ μέγας, ὅτι μέγας ⁵
ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν παρὰ πάντας τοὺς θεούς. Καὶ τίς ἰσχύσει οἰκοδο- ⁶
μῆσαι αὐτῷ οἶκον; ὅτι ὁ οὐρανὸς, καὶ ὁ οὐρανὸς τοῦ οὐρανοῦ οὐ
φέρουσιν αὐτοῦ τὴν δόξαν• καὶ τίς οἰκοδομῶν αὐτῷ οἶκον; ὅτι
ἀλλ’ ἢ τοῦ θυμιᾷν κατέναντι αὐτοῦ. Καὶ νῦν ἀπόστειλόν μοι ἄν- ⁷
δρα σοφὸν καὶ εἰδότα τοῦ ποιῆσαι ἐν τῷ χρυσίῳ, καὶ ἐν τῷ ἀρ-
γυρίῳ, καὶ ἐν τῷ χαλκῷ, καὶ ἐν τῷ σιδήρῳ, καὶ ἐν τῇ πορφύρᾳ,
καὶ ἐν τῷ κοκκίνῳ, καὶ ἐν τῇ ὑακίνθῳ, καὶ ἐπιστάμενον τοῦ γλύ-
ψαι γλυφὴν μετὰ τῶν σοφῶν τῶν μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ ἐν ᾿Ιούδα καὶ ἐν ᾿Ιε-
ρουσαλήμ, ὧν ἡτοίμασε Δαυὶδ ὁ πατήρ μου. Καὶ ἀπόστειλόν μοι ⁸
ξύλα κέδρινα, καὶ ἀρκεύθινα, καὶ πεύκινα ἐκ τοῦ Λιβάνου, ὅτι ἐγὼ
οἶδα ὡς οἱ δοῦλοί σου οἴδασι κόπτειν ξύλα ἐκ τοῦ Λιβάνου· καὶ
ἰδοὺ οἱ παῖδές σου μετὰ τῶν παίδων μου, πορεύσονται ἑτοιμάσαι ⁹
μοι ξύλα εἰς πλῆθος, ὅτι ὁ οἶκος ὃν ἐγὼ οἰκοδομῶ μέγας, καὶ ἔν-
δοξος. Καὶ ἰδοὺ τοῖς ἐργαζομένοις, τοῖς κόπτουσι ξύλα, εἰς βρώ- ¹⁰
ματα δώδεκα σῖτον εἰς δόματα τοῖς παισί σου πυροῦ χόρων εἴκο-
σι χιλιάδας, καὶ κριθῶν χόρων εἴκοσι χιλιάδας, καὶ οἴνου μέτρων
εἴκοσι χιλιάδας, καὶ ἐλαίου κάδων εἴκοσι χιλιάδας. Καὶ εἶπε Χει- ¹¹
ρὰμ βασιλεὺς Τύρου ἐν γραφῇ, καὶ ἀπέστειλε πρὸς Σαλωμὼν ἐν
τῷ ἀγαπῆσαι Κύριον τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ, ἔδωκε σὲ ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς εἰς βα-
σιλέα. Καὶ εἶπε Χειράμ· εὐλογητὸς Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ᾿Ισραήλ, ὃς ¹²
ἐποίησε τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ τὴν γῆν, ὃς ἔδωκε τῷ Δαυὶδ τῷ βασιλεῖ
υἱὸν σοφόν, καὶ ἐπιστάμενον ἐπιστήμην καὶ σύνεσιν, ὃς οἰκοδομήσει
οἶκον τῷ Κυρίῳ, καὶ οἶκον τῇ βασιλείᾳ ἑαυτοῦ· καὶ νῦν ἀπέσταλ- ¹³
κά σοι ἄνδρα σοφόν, καὶ εἰδότα σύνεσιν, τὸν Χειρὰμ τὸν παῖδά
μου, ἢ μήτηρ αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ θυγατέρων Δάν, καὶ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ ἀνὴρ ¹⁴
Τύριος, εἰδότα ποιῆσαι ἐν χρυσίῳ καὶ ἐν ἀργυρίῳ, καὶ ἐν χαλκῷ,
καὶ ἐν σιδήρῳ, καὶ ἐν λίβοις, καὶ ξύλοις, καὶ ὑφαίνειν ἐν τῇ πορ-
φύρᾳ, καὶ ἐν τῇ ὑακίνθῳ, καὶ ἐν τῇ βύσσῳ, καὶ ἐν τῷ κοκκίνῳ,
καὶ γλύψαι γλυφάς, καὶ διανοεῖσθαι πᾶσαν διανόησιν, ὅσα ἂν δῷς
αὐτῷ μετὰ τῶν σοφῶν σου, καὶ σοφῶν Δαυὶδ κυρίου μου τοῦ πα-
τρός σου. Καὶ νῦν τὸν σῖτον, καὶ τὴν κριθὴν, καὶ τὸ ἔλαιον, καὶ ¹⁵
τὸν οἶνον ὃν εἶπεν ὁ κύριός μου, ἀποστειλάτω τοῖς παισὶν αὐτοῦ.
Καὶ ἡμεῖς κόψομεν ξύλα ἐκ τοῦ Λιβάνου κατὰ πᾶσαν τὴν χρείαν ¹⁶
σου, καὶ ἄξομεν αὐτὰ σχεδίαις ἐπὶ θάλασσαν ᾿Ιόππης, καὶ σὺ ἄξεις
αὐτὰ εἰς ῾Ιερουσαλήμ. Καὶ συνήγαγε Σαλωμὼν πάντας τοὺς ἄν- ¹⁷
δρας τοὺς προσηλύτους τοὺς ἐν γῇ ᾿Ισραὴλ μετὰ τὸν ἀριθμὸν, ὃν
ἠρίθμησεν αὐτοὺς Δαυὶδ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ, καὶ εὑρέθησαν ἑκατὸν
πεντήκοντα χιλιάδες καὶ τρισχίλιοι καὶ ἑξακόσιοι. Καὶ ἐποίησεν ¹⁸
ἐξ αὐτῶν ἑβδομήκοντα χιλιάδας νωτοφόρων, καὶ ὀγδοήκοντα χι-
λιάδας λατόμων, καὶ τρισχιλίους ἑξακοσίους τοὺς ἐργοδιώκτας
ἐπὶ τὸν λαόν.

**CHAPTER 1 (CONTINUED)**

¹² riches, and glory, and possessions will I give unto thee, such as there hath not been a like unto thee [O thou] among the kings that were before thee, neither after thee shall there be any such.
¹³ And Solomon came from Bama, which is in Gibeon, unto Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the testimony; and he reigned over Israel.
¹⁴ And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen, and there were for him one thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. And he placed them in the chariot cities, and the people [remained] with the king in Jerusalem.
¹⁵ And the king made silver and gold in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars in Judah as sycamore trees that are in the plain, in abundance.
¹⁶ And the import of Solomon's horses from Egypt; and the king's merchants did purchase the price for their going forth.
¹⁷ And they came up and brought forth from Egypt one chariot for six hundred [shekels] of silver, and a horse for one hundred and fifty; and so likewise unto all the kings of the Hittites, and unto the kings of Syria, by their hands did they bring.

**CHAPTER 2**

¹ And Solomon purposed to build a house for the name of the Lord, and a house for his kingdom.
² And Solomon gathered seventy thousand men who were bearers of burdens, and eighty thousand quarrymen in the mountain; and their overseers were three thousand and six hundred.
³ And Solomon sent unto Hiram, king of Tyre, saying, "As you did with David my father, and sent him cedars to build for himself a house wherein to dwell;
⁴ and behold, I, his son, build a house for the name of the Lord my God, to sanctify it for Him, to burn incense before Him, and [to set forth] the shewbread continually, and to offer burnt offerings continually, in the morning and in the evening, and on the Sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the feasts of the Lord our God, for all time over Israel.
⁵ And the house which I build is great, for great is our God above all gods.
⁶ And who is able to build Him a house? For the heaven, and the heaven of heavens, cannot contain His glory; and who is there that builds a house for Him, save only to burn incense before Him?
⁷ And now, send me a man wise and cunning to work in gold, and in silver, and in bronze, and in iron, and in purple, and in scarlet, and in hyacinth; and one understanding how to engrave an engraving, with the wise men who are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father had prepared.
⁸ And send me cedar wood, and juniper wood, and pine wood from Lebanon, for I know that your servants know how to cut timber from Lebanon;
⁹ and behold, your servants shall be with my servants, to go and prepare for me timber in abundance, for the house which I build is great and glorious.
¹⁰ And behold, to those that labor, to those that cut timber, for food [shall be given] twelve [measures of] grain; and as gifts to your servants, twenty thousand choruses of wheat, and twenty thousand choruses of barley, and twenty thousand measures of wine, and twenty thousand measures of oil.
¹¹ And Hiram, king of Tyre, said in writing, and sent unto Solomon, "Because the Lord loves His people, He hath made you king over them."
¹² And Hiram said, "Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who made the heaven and the earth, who gave to David the king a wise son, and one knowing knowledge and understanding, who shall build a house for the Lord, and a house for his own kingdom;
¹³ and now have I sent unto you a wise man, and one knowing understanding, even Hiram my servant,
¹⁴ whose mother is of the daughters of Dan, and whose father was a man of Tyre; one knowing how to work in gold, and in silver, and in bronze, and in iron, and in libations, and in wood; and to weave in purple, and in hyacinth, and in fine linen, and in scarlet; and to engrave engravings, and to devise every design whatsoever you shall give unto him, with your wise men, and with the wise men of David my lord your father."
¹⁵ And now, the wheat, and the barley, and the oil, and the wine, which my lord has spoken of, let him send unto his servants.
¹⁶ And we will cut timber from Lebanon according to all your need, and we will bring them in floats by sea to Joppa; and you shall bring them up to Jerusalem.
¹⁷ And Solomon gathered all the men who were strangers in the land of Israel, according to the numbering with which David his father had numbered them; and they were found to be one hundred and fifty thousand, and three thousand, and six hundred.
¹⁸ And he made from among them seventy thousand bearers of burdens, and eighty thousand quarrymen, and three thousand six hundred as overseers over the people.
