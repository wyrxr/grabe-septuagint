τὰ σοῦ; καὶ νῦν, ἀδελφή μου, κώφευσον, ὅτι ἀδελφός σου ἐστί· μὴ θῇς τὴν καρδίαν σου τοῦ λαλῆσαι εἰς τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο. Καὶ ἐκάθισε Θαμὰρ χηρεύουσα ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ Ἀβεσσαλὼμ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ
21 αὐτῆς. Καὶ δ βασιλεὺς Δαυὶδ ἤκουσε πάντας τοὺς λόγους τούτους, καὶ ἐθυμώθη σφόδρα, καὶ οὐκ ἐλύπησε τὸ πνεῦμα Ἀμνὼν τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ, ὅτι ἠγάπα αὐτόν, ὅτι πρωτότοκος αὐτοῦ ἦν.
22 Καὶ οὐκ ἐλάλησεν Ἀβεσσαλὼμ μετὰ Ἀμνὼν ἀπὸ πονηροῦ ἕως ἀγαθοῦ, ὅτι ἐμίσει Ἀβεσσαλὼμ τὸν Ἀμνὼν ἐπὶ λόγου οὗ ἐταπείνωσε Θαμὰρ τὴν ἀδελφὴν αὐτοῦ.
23 Καὶ ἐγένετο εἰς διετηρίδα ἡμερῶν, καὶ ἦσαν κείροντες τῷ Ἀβεσσαλὼμ ἐν Βελλασὼρ τῇ ἐχόμενα Ἐφραΐμ· καὶ ἐκάλεσεν Ἀβεσσαλὼμ πάντας τοὺς υἱοὺς
24 τοῦ βασιλέως. Καὶ ἦλθεν Ἀβεσσαλὼμ πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα, καὶ εἶπεν· ἰδοὺ δὴ κείρουσι τῷ δούλῳ σου, πορευθήτω δὴ ὁ βασιλεύς,
25 καὶ οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ μετὰ τοῦ δούλου σου. Καὶ εἶπεν δ βασιλεὺς πρὸς Ἀβεσσαλώμ· μὴ δὴ, υἱέ μου, μὴ πορευθῶμεν πάντες ἡμεῖς, καὶ οὐ μὴ καταβαρυνθῶμεν ἐπὶ σέ. Καὶ ἐβιάσατο αὐτόν·
26 καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησε τοῦ πορευθῆναι, καὶ εὐλόγησεν αὐτόν. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἀβεσσαλώμ· καὶ εἰ μὴ, πορευθήτω δὴ μεθ᾿ ἡμῶν Ἀμνὼν ὁ ἀδελφός μου. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ δ βασιλεύς· ἵνατί πορευθῇ μετὰ σοῦ;
27 Καὶ ἐβιάσατο αὐτὸν Ἀβεσσαλώμ· καὶ ἀπέστειλε μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ τὸν Ἀμνὼν καὶ πάντας τοὺς υἱοὺς τοῦ βασιλέως. Καὶ ἐποίησεν Ἀβεσσαλὼμ πότον κατὰ τὸν πότον τοῦ βασιλέως.
28 Καὶ ἐνετείλατο Ἀβεσσαλὼμ τοῖς παιδαρίοις αὐτοῦ, λέγων· ἴδετε ὡς ἂν ἀγαθυνθῇ ἡ καρδία Ἀμνὼν ἐν τῷ οἴνῳ, καὶ εἴπω πρὸς ὑμᾶς, πατάξατε τὸν Ἀμνών, καὶ θανατώσατε αὐτόν, μὴ φοβηθῆτε, ὅτι οὐχὶ ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ ἐντελλόμενος ὑμῖν; ἀνδρίζεσθε, καὶ γίνεσθε εἰς υἱοὺς δυνάμεως.
29 Καὶ ἐποίησαν τὰ παιδάρια Ἀβεσσαλὼμ τῷ Ἀμνών, καθὰ ἐνετείλατο αὐτοῖς Ἀβεσσαλώμ. Καὶ ἀνέστησαν πάντες οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ ἐπεκάθισαν ἕκαστος ἐπὶ τὴν ἡμίονον αὑτοῦ, καὶ ἔφυγον.
30 Καὶ ἐγένετο, αὐτῶν ὄντων ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ, καὶ ἡ ἀκοὴ ἦλθε πρὸς Δαυίδ, λέγων· ἐπάταξεν Ἀβεσσαλὼμ πάντας τοὺς υἱοὺς τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ οὐ κατελείφθη ἐξ αὐτῶν οὐδὲ εἷς.
31 Καὶ ἀνέστη δ βασιλεύς, καὶ διέρρηξε τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐκοιμήθη ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, καὶ πάντες οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ περιεστῶτες αὐτῷ διέρρηξαν τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτῶν.
32 Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Ἰωναδάβ, υἱὸς Σαμαὰ ἀδελφοῦ Δαυίδ, καὶ εἶπε· μὴ εἰπάτω δ κύριός μου δ βασιλεύς,

### Chapter 13

**20** [Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee?] Now therefore, my sister, be silent; for he is thy brother; lay not thy heart to speak concerning this matter. And Tamar sat [as one] desolate in the house of Absalom her brother.

**21** And King David heard all these words, and he was wroth greatly; yet he grieved not the spirit of Amnon his son, for he loved him, because he was his firstborn.

**22** And Absalom spake not with Amnon, neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon because of the matter for which he had humbled Tamar his sister.

**23** And it came to pass after the space of two years, that Absalom's sheep-shearers were in Baal-hazor, in the adjoining [lands] of Ephraim; and Absalom called all the king's sons.

**24** And Absalom came unto the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant doth shear [his sheep]; let the king, I pray thee, and his servants go with thy servant.

**25** And the king said unto Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all go, lest we be a burden unto thee. And he urged him;

**26** but he would not go, and he blessed him. Then Absalom said, If not, I pray thee, let Amnon my brother go with us. And the king said unto him, Wherefore should he go with thee?

**28** And Absalom commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye, when the heart of Amnon shall be merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon, and slay him; fear not, for [it is] not I who command you? Be courageous, and be ye sons of might.

**29** And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon, even as Absalom had commanded them. And all the king's sons arose, and each man mounted upon his mule, and fled.

**30** And it came to pass, while they were on the way, that a report came unto David, saying, Absalom hath smitten all the king's sons, and not one of them is left alive.

**31** Then the king arose, and rent his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants who stood about him rent their garments.

**32** And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord the king say,
