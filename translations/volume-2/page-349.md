3 ἔθηκαν τὴν κιβωτὸν τὴν ἁγίαν εἰς τὸν οἶκον, ὃν ᾠκοδόμησε Σαλωμὼν υἱὸς Δαυὶδ τοῦ βασιλέως Ἰσραήλ· καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς οὐκ ἐστὶν ὑμῖν ἐπᾶραι ἐπ᾽ ὤμων οὐδέν· νῦν οὖν λειτουργήσατε τῷ Κυρίῳ Θεῷ ὑμῶν, καὶ τῷ λαῷ αὐτοῦ Ἰσραήλ.
4 Καὶ ἑτοιμάσθητε κατ᾽ οἴκους πατριῶν ὑμῶν, καὶ κατὰ τὰς ἐφημερίας ὑμῶν, κατὰ τὴν γραφὴν Δαυὶδ βασιλέως Ἰσραήλ, καὶ διὰ χειρὸς βασιλέως Σαλωμὼν υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ·
5 καὶ στῆτε ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ κατὰ τὰς διαιρέσεις οἴκων πατριῶν ὑμῶν τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς ὑμῶν τοῖς υἱοῖς τοῦ λαοῦ, καὶ μερὶς οἴκου πατριᾶς τοῖς Λευίταις.
6 Καὶ θύσατε τὸ Φασέκ, καὶ τὰ ἅγια ἑτοιμάσατε τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς ὑμῶν, τοῦ ποιῆσαι κατὰ τὸν λόγον Κυρίου διὰ χειρὸς Μωυσῆ.
7 Καὶ ἀπήρξατο Ἰωσίας τοῖς υἱοῖς τοῦ λαοῦ πρόβατα, καὶ ἀμνούς, καὶ ἐρίφους ἀπὸ τῶν τέκνων τῶν αἰγῶν, πάντα εἰς τὸ Φασέκ, καὶ πάντας τοὺς εὑρεθέντας εἰς ἀριθμόν τριάκοντα χιλιάδας, καὶ μόσχων τρεῖς χιλιάδας, ταῦτα ἀπὸ τῆς ὑπάρξεως τοῦ βασιλέως.
8 Καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες αὐτοῦ ἀπήρξαντο τῷ λαῷ, καὶ τοῖς ἱερεῦσι, καὶ Λευίταις· καὶ ἔδωκε Χελκίας, καὶ Ζαχαρίας, καὶ Ἰειὴλ οἱ ἄρχοντες οἴκου τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῖς ἱερεῦσι, καὶ ἔδωκαν εἰς τὸ Φασὲκ πρόβατα, καὶ ἀμνούς, καὶ ἐρίφους δισχίλια ἑξακόσια, καὶ μόσχους τριακοσίους.
9 Καὶ Χωνενίας, καὶ Βαναίας, καὶ Σαμαίας, καὶ Ναθαναὴλ ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ Ἀσαβία, καὶ Ἰειήλ, καὶ Ἰωζαβὰδ ἄρχοντες τῶν Λευιτῶν ἀπήρξαντο τοῖς Λευίταις εἰς τὸ Φασὲκ πρόβατα πεντακισχίλια, καὶ μόσχους πεντακοσίους.
10 Καὶ κατωρθώθη ἡ λειτουργία, καὶ ἔστησαν οἱ ἱερεῖς ἐπὶ τὴν στάσιν ἑαυτῶν, καὶ οἱ Λευῖται ἐπὶ τὰς διαιρέσεις αὐτῶν κατὰ τὴν ἐντολὴν τοῦ βασιλέως.
11 Καὶ ἔθυσαν τὸ Φασέκ, καὶ προσέχεαν οἱ ἱερεῖς τὸ αἷμα ἐκ χειρὸς αὐτῶν, καὶ οἱ Λευῖται ἐξέδειραν.
12 Καὶ ἡτοίμασαν τὴν ὁλοκαύτωσιν παραδοῦναι αὐτοῖς κατὰ τὴν διαίρεσιν κατ᾽ οἴκους πατριῶν τοῖς υἱοῖς τοῦ λαοῦ, τοῦ προσάγειν τῷ Κυρίῳ, ὡς γέγραπται ἐν βίβλῳ (νόμῳ) Μωυσῆ· καὶ οὕτως εἰς τὸ πρωΐ.
13 Καὶ ὤπτησαν τὸ Φασὲκ ἐν πυρὶ κατὰ τὴν κρίσιν, καὶ τὰ ἅγια ἤψησαν ἐν τοῖς χαλκείοις, καὶ ἐν τοῖς λέβησι, καὶ εὐωδώθη, καὶ ἔδραμον πρὸς πάντας τοὺς υἱοὺς τοῦ λαοῦ.

**Chapter 35 [continued]**

³ ...And they placed the holy ark in the House which Solomon, the son of David, the king of Israel, had built. And the king said: 'It is not for you to bear [it] upon your shoulders any longer. Now therefore, minister ye unto the LORD your God, and unto His people Israel.'
⁴ And prepare yourselves according to the houses of your fathers' [families], and according to your courses of service, after the writing of David king of Israel, and by the hand of Solomon his son.
⁵ And ye shall stand in the House according to the divisions of your fathers' houses, for your brethren, the sons of the people; and [let there be] a portion of a father's house unto the Levites.
⁶ And sacrifice ye the Passover, and prepare the holy [offerings] for your brethren, to do according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.
⁷ And Josiah gave as a contribution unto the children of the people: sheep, and lambs, and kids from among the young of the goats, all for the Passover; even all that were found, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand calves: these [he gave] from the king's own substance.
⁸ And his princes also contributed unto the people, and to the priests, and to the Levites. And Hilkiah, and Zechariah, and Jehiel, the rulers of the House of God, gave unto the priests; and they gave for the Passover two thousand and six hundred sheep, and lambs, and kids, and three hundred calves.
⁹ And Conaniah, and Shemaiah, and Nethanel his brother, and Hashabiah, and Jehiel, and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites, contributed unto the Levites for the Passover five thousand sheep, and five hundred calves.
¹⁰ Thus was the service established, and the priests stood in their appointed places, and the Levites in their divisions, according to the king's commandment.
¹¹ And they sacrificed the Passover; and the priests sprinkled the blood from their hand, and the Levites flayed [the offerings].
¹² And they prepared the burnt offering, to deliver it unto them according to the division of the houses of the fathers, for the children of the people, to offer unto the LORD, as it is written in the book (the Law) of Moses; and likewise for the morning [offerings].
¹³ And they roasted the Passover in fire according to the ordinance; and the holy [meats] they boiled in pots, and in cauldrons, and made [them] savory; and they brought [them] quickly unto all the children of the people.
¹⁴ And afterward they prepared for themselves, and for the priests; for the priests were occupied in offering up the burnt offerings, and the fat until night. And the Levites prepared for them, and for their brethren, the sons of Aaron.
¹⁵ And the chanters, the sons of Asaph, stood in their place, according to the commandments of David, and
