23 ξένος, καὶ ἡ θύρα μου παντὶ ἐλθόντι ἠνέωκτο. Εἰ δὲ καὶ ἁμαρ-
24 τῶν ἀκουσίως, ἔκρυψα τὴν ἁμαρτίαν μου (οὐ γὰρ διετράπην πο-
25 λυοχλίαν λαοῦ, τοῦ μὴ ἐξαγορεῦσαι ἐναντίον αὐτῶν)· εἰ δὲ καὶ
26 εἴασα ἀδύνατον ἐξελθεῖν τὴν θύραν μου κόλπῳ κενῷ· τίς δῴη
27 ἀκούοντά μου; χεῖρα δὲ Κυρίου εἰ μὴ ἐδεδοίκειν, συγγραφὴν δέ, ἣν
28 εἶχον κατά τινος, εἰ ἐπ’ ὤμοις περιθέμενος ὡς στέφανον, ἀνεγί-
29 νωσκον, καὶ εἰ μὴ ῥήξας αὐτὴν ἀπέδωκα, οὐδὲν λαβὼν παρὰ χρεω-
30 φειλέτου (μου)· εἰ ἐπ’ ἐμοὶ ποτε ἡ γῆ ἐστέναξεν, εἰ δὲ καὶ οἱ αὔ-
31 λακες αὐτῆς ἔκλαυσαν ὁμοθυμαδόν· εἰ τὴν ἰσχὺν αὐτῆς ἔφαγον
32 ἄνευ τιμῆς μόνος, εἰ δὲ καὶ ψυχὴν κυρίου τῆς γῆς ἐκβαλὼν ἐλύ-
33 πησα· ἀντὶ πυροῦ ἐξέλθῃ μοι κνίδη, ἀντὶ δὲ κριθῆς βάτος.

ΚΕΦ. ΛΒ´. XXXII.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐπαύσατο Ἰὼβ ῥήμασιν· ἡσύχασαν δὲ καὶ οἱ τρεῖς φί-
2 λοι αὐτοῦ ἔτι (δὲ) ἀντειπεῖν Ἰώβ· ἦν γὰρ δίκαιος ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ
3 Ἰώβ. Ὠργίσθη δὲ Ἐλιούς, ὁ τοῦ Βαραχιήλ, ὁ τοῦ Βουζί, ἐκ τῆς
4 συγγενείας Ῥάμ, τῆς Αὐσίτιδος χώρας, καὶ ὠργίσθη τῷ Ἰὼβ
5 σφόδρα, διότι ἀπέφηνεν ἑαυτὸν δίκαιον ἔναντι Κυρίου. Καὶ κατὰ
6 τῶν δὲ τριῶν φίλων αὐτοῦ ὠργίσθη σφόδρα, διότι οὐκ ἠδυνήθησαν
7 ἀποκριθῆναι ἀντίθετα τῷ Ἰὼβ, καὶ ἔθεντο αὐτὸν εἶναι ἀσεβῆ.
8 Ἐλιοὺς δὲ ὑπέμεινε δοῦναι ἀπόκρισιν τῷ Ἰώβ· Ὅτι πρεσβύτεροι
9 εἰσὶν αὐτοῦ ἡμέραις. Καὶ ἴδεν Ἐλιουὸς ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν ἀπόκρισις
10 ἐν στόματι τῶν τριῶν ἀνδρῶν, καὶ ἐθυμώθη ὀργὴ αὐτοῦ. Ὑπο-
11 λαβὼν δὲ Ἐλιούς, ὁ τοῦ Βαραχιήλ, ὁ τοῦ Βουζί, λέγει· νεώτερος
12 μὲν εἰμι τῷ χρόνῳ, ἡμεῖς δὲ ἐστε πρεσβύτεροι· διότι ἡσύχασα,
13 φοβηθεὶς τοῦ ἀναγγεῖλαι ὑμῖν τὴν ἐμὴν ἐπιστήμην.

**23** [No stranger did lodge abroad,] and my door was opened unto every one that came.
**24** Or if, having sinned unwittingly, I have hidden my transgression (for I was not put to shame by the throng of the people, so as not to confess before them);
**25** or if I have suffered the helpless to depart from my door with an empty bosom;
**26** [then] who would give ear unto me? But if I have not feared the hand of the Lord;
**27** or if, [concerning] the bond which I held against any man, I had worn it upon my shoulders as a crown, [and] did read it,
**28** and had not torn it up and returned it, having received naught from my debtor;
**29** If ever the earth groaned against me, or if its furrows wept together in one accord;
**30** or if I ate its strength [and produce] alone, without payment;
**31** or if, having cast out the very soul of the lord of the land, I grieved [him];
**32** then let nettles come forth unto me instead of wheat, and instead of barley, the bramble.

## CHAPTER XXXII.

**1** And Job ceased [from his] words; and his three friends also held their peace,
**2** [so as] yet to answer Job; for Job was righteous before him.
**3** But Elihu, the son of Barachel, the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram, from the land of Ausitis, was wroth;
**4** and he was exceedingly wroth with Job,
**5** because he declared himself righteous before the Lord. And against his three friends
**6** also was he exceedingly wroth, because they were not able
**7** to answer things contrary unto Job, and had esteemed him to be impious.
**8** But Elihu had waited to give an answer unto Job; for that they were older than he in days.
**9** And Elihu saw that there was no answer
**10** in the mouth of the three men, and his anger was kindled.
**11** Then Elihu, the son of Barachel, the Buzite, answered and said:
**12** I am indeed younger in time, but ye are older; therefore I was silent,
**13** fearing to declare unto you my knowledge.
