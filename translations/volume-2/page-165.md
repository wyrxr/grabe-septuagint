λόγων Ἠλὰ, καὶ πάντα ἃ ἐποίησεν, οὐκ ἰδοὺ ταῦτα γεγραμμένα
ἐν βιβλίῳ λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν τῶν βασιλέων Ἰσραήλ; Ἐν ἔτει εἰ- 15
κοστῷ καὶ ἑβδόμῳ τοῦ Ἀσὰ βασιλέως Ἰούδα (καὶ) ἐβασίλευσε Ζαμβρὶ ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας ἐν Θερσᾶ· καὶ ἡ παρεμβολὴ Ἰσραὴλ ἐπὶ Γαβαθὼν τῇ τῶν ἀλλοφύλων. Καὶ ἤκουσεν ὁ λαὸς ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ, 16
λεγόντων· συνεστράφη Ζαμβρὶ, καὶ ἔπαισε τὸν βασιλέα· καὶ ἐβασίλευσαν ἐν Ἰσραὴλ τὸν Ἄμβρι τὸν ἡγούμενον τῆς στρατιᾶς ἐπὶ
Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ. Καὶ ἀνέβη Ἄμβρι, 17
καὶ πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἐκ Γαβαθὼν, καὶ περιεκάθισαν ἐπὶ
Θερσᾶ. Καὶ ἐγενήθη ὡς εἶδε Ζαμβρὶ, ὅτι προκατείληπται αὐτοῦ 18
ἡ πόλις, καὶ εἰσπορεύεται εἰς ἄντρον τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ
ἐνεπύρισεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν τὸν οἶκον τοῦ βασιλέως ἐν πυρὶ, καὶ ἀπέθανεν, ὑπὲρ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν αὐτοῦ ὧν ἐποίησε τοῦ ποιῆσαι τὸ πονηρὸν ἐνώπιον Κυρίου, τοῦ πορευθῆναι ἐν ὁδῷ Ἱεροβοὰμ υἱοῦ Ναβὰτ,
καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις αὐτοῦ αἷς ἐποίησεν, ὡς ἐξήμαρτε τὸν Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Ζαμβρὶ, καὶ τὰς συνάψεις αὐτοῦ 20
ἃς συνῆψεν, οὐχὶ ταῦτα γεγραμμένα ἐπὶ βιβλίου λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν τῶν βασιλέων Ἰσραήλ; Τότε μερίζεται ὁ λαὸς Ἰσραὴλ, τὸ 21
ἥμισυ τοῦ λαοῦ γίνεται ὀπίσω Θαμνὶ υἱοῦ Γωνὰθ, τοῦ βασιλεῦσαι
αὐτὸν, καὶ τὸ ἥμισυ τοῦ λαοῦ γίνεται ὀπίσω Ἄμβρι. Καὶ ὑπερίσχυσεν ὁ λαὸς ὁ ἀκολουθῶν τῷ Ἄμβρι, καὶ ἡττήθη ὁ λαὸς ὁ ὢν 22
ὀπίσω Θαμνὶ υἱοῦ Γωνάθ· καὶ ἀπέθανε Θαμνὶ, καὶ Ἰωρὰμ ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ, καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν Ἄμβρι μετὰ Θαμνί. Ἐν τῷ ἔτει τῷ τριακοστῷ καὶ πρώτῳ ἔτει τοῦ Ἀσὰ βασιλέως Ἰούδα βασιλεύει Ἄμβρι ἐπὶ Ἰσραὴλ δώδεκα ἔτη· ἐν Θερσᾶ 23
βασιλεύει ἓξ ἔτη. Καὶ ἐκτήσατο Ἄμβρι τὸ ὄρος τὸ Σεμηρὼν παρὰ 24
Σεμὴρ τοῦ κυρίου τοῦ ὄρους ἐν δύο ταλάντων ἀργυρίου· καὶ ᾠκοδόμησε τὸ ὄρος, καὶ ἐπεκάλεσε τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ ὄρους οὗ ᾠκοδόμησεν, ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι Σεμὴρ τοῦ κυρίου τοῦ ὄρους, Σεμηρών. Καὶ 25
ἐποίησεν Ἄμβρι τὸ πονηρὸν ἐνώπιον Κυρίου, καὶ ἐπονηρεύσατο ὑπὲρ
πάντας τοὺς γενομένους ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἐν πάσῃ 26
τῇ ὁδῷ Ἱεροβοὰμ υἱοῦ Ναβὰτ, καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις αὐτοῦ, αἷς ἐξήμαρτε τὸν Ἰσραὴλ, τοῦ παροργίσαι τὸν Κύριον Θεὸν Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τοῖς ματαίοις αὐτῶν. Καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ τῶν λόγων Ἄμβρι, καὶ πάντα ἃ ἐποίησε, καὶ ἡ δυναστεία αὐτοῦ ἣν ἐποίησεν, 27
οὐχὶ ταῦτα γεγραμμένα ἐν βιβλίῳ λόγων τῶν ἡμερῶν τῶν βασιλέων Ἰσραήλ;

### Kings III, Chapter 16 (Cont.)

**14** [Now the rest of the acts of] Elah, and all that he wrought, behold, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

**15** In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, then Zimri reigned seven days in Tirzah; and the camp of Israel [was pitched] at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.

**16** And the people in the camp heard them saying, "Zimri hath conspired, and hath smitten the king!" So they made Ambri king over Israel, even Ambri, the captain of the host over Israel, on that day in the camp.

**17** And Ambri went up, and all Israel with him, from Gibbethon, and they besieged Tirzah.

**18** And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he entered into the inner keep of the king's house, and burnt the king's house over him with fire, and died;

**19** for his sins which he had committed, doing evil in the sight of the Lord, walking in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sins which he had wrought, by which he made Israel to sin.

**20** Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his conspiracies which he formed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

**21** Then was the people of Israel divided: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half of the people followed Ambri.

**22** And the people who followed Ambri prevailed against the people who were after Tibni the son of Ginath; and Tibni died, and Joram his brother at that time, and Ambri reigned after Tibni.

**23** In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah, Ambri began to reign over Israel, and reigned twelve years: in Tirzah he reigned six years.

**24** And Ambri acquired the hill Shemeron from Shemer, the lord of the hill, for two talents of silver; and he built upon the hill, and called the name of the hill which he built, by the name of Shemer, the lord of the hill, Shemeron.

**25** And Ambri did evil in the sight of the Lord, and did more wickedly than all those that were before him.

**26** For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sins, by which he made Israel to sin, to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger with their vain [idols].

**27** Now the rest of the acts of Ambri, and all that he wrought, and his mighty deeds which he performed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
