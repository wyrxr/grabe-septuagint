ΚΕΦ. Γ΄. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Β΄. 550
**24** πρὸς Δαυίδ, καὶ ἀπέσταλκεν αὐτόν, καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ἐν εἰρήνῃ. Καὶ
εἰσῆλθεν Ἰωὰβ πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα, καὶ εἶπε· τί τοῦτο ἐποίησας;
ἰδοὺ ἦλθεν Ἀβεννὴρ πρὸς σέ, καὶ ἵνατί ἐξαπέσταλκας αὐτόν, καὶ
**25** ἀπῆλθεν ἐν εἰρήνῃ; Οὐκ οἶδας τὴν κακίαν Ἀβεννὴρ υἱοῦ Νήρ, ὅτι
ἀπατῆσαί σε παραγέγονε, καὶ γνῶναι τὴν ἔξοδόν σου, καὶ τὴν
**26** εἴσοδόν σου, καὶ γνῶναι ἅπαντα ὅσα σὺ ποιεῖς; Καὶ ἀνέστρεψεν
Ἰωὰβ ἀπὸ τοῦ Δαυίδ, καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ἀγγέλους ὀπίσω Ἀβεννήρ,
καὶ ἐπιστρέφουσιν αὐτὸν ἀπὸ τοῦ φρέατος τοῦ Σειράμ, καὶ Δαυίδ
**27** οὐκ ᾔδει. Καὶ ἐπέστρεψε τὸν Ἀβεννὴρ εἰς Χεβρὼν, καὶ ἐξέκλινεν
αὐτὸν Ἰωὰβ ἐκ πλαγίων τῆς πύλης, λαλῆσαι πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐνεδρεύων·
καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτὸν ἐκεῖ ἐπὶ τὴν ψόαν, καὶ ἀπέθανεν ἐν
**28** τῷ αἵματι Ἀσαὴλ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ Ἰωάβ. Καὶ ἤκουσε Δαυὶδ μετὰ
ταῦτα, καὶ εἶπεν ἀθῶός εἰμι, καὶ ἡ βασιλεία μου ἀπὸ Κυρίου, καὶ
**29** ἕως αἰῶνος ἀπὸ τῶν αἱμάτων Ἀβεννὴρ υἱοῦ Νήρ. Κατατησάτωσαν
ἐπὶ κεφαλὴν Ἰωάβ, καὶ ἐπὶ πάντα τὸν οἶκον τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ,
καὶ μὴ ἐκλίποι ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου Ἰωὰβ γονορρύης, καὶ λεπρός,
καὶ κρατῶν σκυτάλην, καὶ πίπτων ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ, καὶ ἐλασσούμενος
**30** ἄρτοις. Ἰωὰβ δὲ καὶ Ἀβισαὶ ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ διαπαρετηροῦντο
τὸν Ἀβεννὴρ ἀνθ᾿ ὧν ἐθανάτωσε τὸν Ἀσαὴλ τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτὸν
ἐν Γαβαὼν, ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ.
**31** Καὶ εἶπε Δαυὶδ πρὸς Ἰωάβ, καὶ πρὸς πάντα τὸν λαὸν τὸν μετ᾿
αὐτοῦ· διαῤῥήξατε τὰ ἱμάτια ὑμῶν, καὶ περιζώσασθε σάκκους,
καὶ κόπτεσθε ἔμπροσθεν Ἀβεννήρ. Καὶ ὁ βασιλεὺς Δαυὶδ ἐπορεύετο
ὀπίσω τῆς κλίνης.
**32** Καὶ θάπτουσι τὸν Ἀβεννὴρ ἐν Χεβρῶν. Καὶ ἦρεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τὴν
φωνὴν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔκλαυσεν ἐπὶ τοῦ τάφου αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔκλαυσε πᾶς
**33** ὁ λαὸς ἐπὶ Ἀβεννήρ. Καὶ ἐθρήνησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐπὶ Ἀβεννήρ,
καὶ εἶπεν· εἰ κατὰ τὸν θάνατον Νάβαλ ἀποθανεῖται Ἀβεννήρ;
**34** Αἱ χεῖρές σου οὐκ ἐδέθησαν, οἱ πόδες σου οὐκ ἐν πέδαις· οὐ προσήγαγεν
ὡς Νάβαλ, ἐνώπιον υἱῶν ἀδικίας ἔπεσας. Καὶ συνήχθη
**35** πᾶς ὁ λαὸς τοῦ κλαῦσαι αὐτόν. Καὶ ἦλθε πᾶς ὁ λαὸς περιδειπνίσαι
τὸν Δαυὶδ ἄρτους ἔτι οὔσης ἡμέρας. Καὶ ὤμοσε Δαυίδ,
λέγων· τάδε ποιήσαι μοι ὁ Θεὸς καὶ τάδε προσθείη, ἔτι ἐὰν μὴ
**36** δύῃ ὁ ἥλιος, οὐ μὴ γεύσωμαι ἄρτου ἢ ἀπὸ παντὸς τινός. Καὶ
πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ἔγνω, καὶ ἤρεσεν ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν
ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐνώπιον τοῦ λαοῦ ἀγαθόν.
**37** Καὶ ἔγνω πᾶς ὁ λαὸς καὶ πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, ὅτι
οὐκ ἐγένετο παρὰ τοῦ

**24** unto David, and he had sent him away, and he departed in peace. And Joab came in unto the king, and said, "What is this that thou hast done? Behold, Abner came unto thee, and wherefore hast thou sent him away, and he departed in peace?"
**25** Knowest thou not the wickedness of Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest?
**26** And Joab turned back from David, and sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Siram; but David knew it not.
**27** And he brought Abner back to Hebron; and Joab turned him aside from the gate, to speak with him cunningly; and he smote him there upon the groin, that he died for the blood of Asahel, Joab's brother.
**28** And when David heard [of it] afterward, he said, "I am innocent, and my kingdom before the Lord, and forever, from the blood of Abner the son of Ner.
**29** Let it fall upon the head of Joab, and upon all the house of his father; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue of seed, or that is a leper, or that holdeth a staff, or that falleth by the sword, or that lacketh bread."
**30** Now Joab and Abishai his brother lay in wait for Abner, because he had slain Asahel their brother in Gibeon, in the battle.
**31** And David said unto Joab, and to all the people that were with him, "Rend your garments, and gird yourselves with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner." And King David followed after the bier.
**32** And they buried Abner in Hebron. And the king lifted up his voice, and wept at his grave; and all the people wept over Abner.
**33** And the king lamented over Abner, and said, "Shall Abner die as Nabal died?"
**34** Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters; thou didst not approach [thy doom] as Nabal, [but] thou didst fall before sons of iniquity.
**35** And all the people gathered to weep for him. And all the people came to offer David bread for a meal, while it was yet day. And David swore, saying, "So may God do to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or anything at all, before the sun go down."
**36** And all the people knew [of it], and it was pleasing in their eyes, all that the king did before the people as good.
**37** And all the people and all Israel knew on that day that it was not from the king that Abner the son of Ner was slain.
