ΚΕΦ. Κ΄. ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΩΝ Γ΄.
34 Ἔλαβεν ὁ πατήρ μου παρὰ τοῦ πατρός σου ἀποδώσω σοι· καὶ ἐξέδους θήσεις σαυτῷ ἐν Δαμασκῷ, καθὼς ἔθετο ὁ πατήρ μου ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ, κἀγὼ ἐν διαθήκῃ ἐξαποστελῶ σε. Καὶ διέθετο αὐτῷ διαθήκην, καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν αὐτόν.
35 Καὶ ἄνθρωπος εἷς ἐκ τῶν υἱῶν τῶν προφητῶν εἶπε πρὸς τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ ἐν λόγῳ Κυρίου· πάταξόν με δή· καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησεν ὁ ἄνθρωπος πατάξαι αὐτόν.
36 Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτόν· ἀνθ’ ὧν οὐκ ἤκουσας τῆς φωνῆς Κυρίου, ἰδοὺ σὺ ἀποτρέχεις ἀπ’ ἐμοῦ, καὶ πατάξει σε λέων. Καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ· καὶ εὑρίσκει αὐτὸν λέων, καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτόν.
37 Καὶ εὑρίσκει ἄνθρωπον ἄλλον, καὶ εἶπε· πάταξόν με δή. Καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτὸν ὁ ἄνθρωπος, πατάξας καὶ συνέτριψε.
38 Καὶ ἐπορεύθη ὁ προφήτης, καὶ ἔστη τῷ βασιλεῖ Ἰσραὴλ ἐπὶ τῆς ὁδοῦ, καὶ κατεδήσατο ἐν ταλαμῶνι τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ.
39 Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ὁ βασιλεὺς παρεπορεύετο, καὶ οὗτος ἐβόα πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα, καὶ εἶπεν· ὁ δοῦλός σου ἐξῆλθεν ἐπὶ τὴν στρατιὰν τοῦ πολέμου, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἀνὴρ εἰσήγαγε πρός με ἄνδρα, καὶ εἶπε· φύλαξον τὸν ἄνδρα τοῦτον· ἐὰν ἐκπηδῶν ἐκπηδήσῃ, καὶ ἔσται ἡ ψυχή σου ἀντὶ τῆς ψυχῆς αὐτοῦ, ἢ τάλαντον ἀργυρίου στήσεις.
40 Καὶ ἐγενήθη, περιεβλέψατο ὁ δοῦλός σου ὧδε καὶ ὧδε, καὶ οὗτος οὐκ ἦν· καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτὸν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἰσραήλ· ἰδοὺ καὶ τὰ ἔνεδρα παρ’ ἐμοί, ἐφόνευσας.
41 Καὶ ἔσπευσε, καὶ ἀφεῖλε τὸν ταλαμῶνα ἀπὸ τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἔγνω αὐτὸν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἰσραήλ, ὅτι ἐκ τῶν προφητῶν οὗτος.
42 Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτόν· τάδε λέγει Κύριος· διότι ἐξήγαγες σὺ ἄνδρα ὀλέθριον ἐκ χειρός σου, καὶ ἔσται ἡ ψυχή σου ἀντὶ τῆς ψυχῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὁ λαός σου ἀντὶ τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ.
43 Καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς οἶκον αὐτοῦ, συγκεχυμένος καὶ ἐκλελυμένος, καὶ ἔρχεται εἰς Σαμάρειαν.

**ΚΕΦ. ΚΑ΄.**

1 ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο μετὰ τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα, ἀμπελὼν ἦν εἰς τῷ Ναβουθαὶ τῷ Ἰεζραηλίτῃ παρὰ τῇ ἅλῳ Ἀχαὰβ βασιλέως Σαμαρείας.
2 Καὶ ἐλάλησεν Ἀχαὰβ πρὸς Ναβουθαί, λέγων· δός μοι τὸν ἀμπελωνά σου, καὶ ἔσται μοι εἰς κῆπον λαχάνων, ὅτι ἐγγίζων οὗτος τῷ οἴκῳ μου, καὶ δώσω σοι ἀμπελῶνα ἄλλον ἀγαθὸν ὑπὲρ αὐτόν· εἰ δὲ ἀρέσκει ἐνώπιόν σου, δώσω σοι ἀργύριον ἀντάλλαγμα

**Chapter 20**

**34** "The cities, which my father took from thy father, I will restore unto thee; and thou shalt make for thyself bazaars in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. And I will send thee away with a covenant."
And [Ahab] made a covenant with him, and sent him away.

**35** And one man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbor by the word of the Lord, "Strike me, I pray thee." But the man would not strike him.

**36** And he said unto him, "Because thou hast not hearkened unto the voice of the Lord, behold, when thou departest from me, a lion shall strike thee." And he departed from him; and a lion found him, and struck him.

**37** And he found another man, and said, "Strike me, I pray thee." And the man struck him, striking [him] and crushing [him].

**38** And the prophet went and stood before the king of Israel by the way, and he bound a bandage upon his eyes.

**39** And it came to pass, as the king passed by, that this man cried out unto the king, and said, "Thy servant went out to the host of the war; and behold, a man brought a man unto me, and said, 'Keep this man. If he shall escape, then shall thy soul be for his soul, or thou shalt pay a talent of silver.'"

**40** And it came to pass, [that] thy servant looked hither and thither, and this man was not there. And the king of Israel said unto him, "Behold, even the ambushes are with me; thou hast slain [him]."

**41** And he hastened and took the bandage from his eyes; and the king of Israel knew him, that he was of the prophets.

**42** And he said unto him, "Thus saith the Lord: Because thou hast led out of thy hand a man appointed to destruction, so shall thy soul be for his soul, and thy people for his people."

**43** And the king of Israel went unto his house, dejected and disheartened, and came to Samaria.

**Chapter 21**

**1** And it came to pass after these things, that there was a vineyard belonging to Naboth the Jezreelite, by the threshing-floor of Ahab, king of Samaria.

**2** And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, "Give me thy vineyard, that it may be unto me a garden of herbs, for it is nigh unto my house; and I will give thee another vineyard, better than it, for it. Or if it please thee, I will give thee silver in exchange for it."
