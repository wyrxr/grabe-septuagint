σαι τὸν Κύριον πάντα τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα τῷ Ἰώβ, εἶπεν ὁ Κύ-
ριος Ἐλιφὰζ τῷ Θαιμανίτῃ· ἥμαρτες σύ, καὶ οἱ δύο φίλοι σου·
οὐ γὰρ ἐλαλήσατε ἐνώπιόν μου ἀληθὲς οὐδέν, ὥσπερ ὁ θεράπων
8 μου Ἰώβ. Καὶ νῦν λάβετε ἑαυτοῖς ἑπτὰ μόσχους καὶ ἑπτὰ κριούς,
καὶ πορευθῆτε πρὸς τὸν παῖδά μου Ἰώβ, καὶ ποιήσετε κάρπωμα
περὶ ὑμῶν· Ἰὼβ δὲ ὁ θεράπων μου εὔξεται περὶ ὑμῶν· ὅτι εἰ μὴ
πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ λήψομαι, καὶ εἰ μὴ δι᾿ αὐτόν, ἀπώλεσα ἂν ὑμᾶς·
οὐ γὰρ ἐλαλήσατε πρὸς μὲ κατὰ τοῦ θεράποντός μου Ἰὼβ οὐδὲν
9 ἀγαθόν. Ἐπορεύθησαν δὲ Ἐλιφὰζ ὁ Θαιμανίτης, καὶ Βαλδὰδ ὁ
Σαυχίτης, καὶ Σωφὰρ ὁ Μιναῖος, καὶ ἐποίησαν (ἑαυτοῖς) καθὼς
συνέταξεν αὐτοῖς ὁ Κύριος· καὶ ἔλυσε τὴν ἁμαρτίαν αὐτῶν διὰ
10 Ἰώβ. Ὁ δὲ Κύριος ηὔξησε τὸν Ἰὼβ· εὐξαμένου δὲ αὐτοῦ περὶ
τῶν φίλων αὐτοῦ, ἀφῆκεν αὐτοῖς τὴν ἁμαρτίαν. Ἔδωκε δὲ ὁ Κύ-
ριος τῷ Ἰὼβ πάντα διπλᾶ ὧν εἶχεν ἔμπροσθεν (εἰς διπλασιασμόν.)
11 Ἤκουσαν δὲ πάντες οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ αἱ ἀδελφαὶ αὐτοῦ πάντα
τὰ συμβεβηκότα αὐτῷ, καὶ ἦλθον πρὸς αὐτόν, καὶ πάντες (δὲ) ὅσοι
ᾔδεισαν αὐτὸν ἐκ πρώτου. Φαγόντες δὲ καὶ πιόντες παρ᾿ αὐτῷ,
παρεκάλεσαν αὐτόν· καὶ ἐθαύμασαν ἐπὶ πᾶσι κακοῖς, οἷς ἐπήγα-
γεν αὐτῷ ὁ Κύριος· καὶ ἔδωκαν αὐτῷ ἕκαστος ἀμνάδα μίαν, καὶ
12 τετράδραχμον χρυσοῦν ἄσημον. Ὁ δὲ Κύριος ηὐλόγησε τοῦ Ἰὼβ
τὰ ἔσχατα μᾶλλον ἢ τὰ ἔμπροσθεν ἦν δὲ τὰ κτήνη αὐτοῦ, πρό-
βατα μύρια τετρακισχίλια, κάμηλοι ἑξακισχίλιαι, ζεύγη βοῶν χί-
λια, ὄνοι θήλειαι νομάδες χίλιαι. Γεννῶνται δὲ αὐτῷ υἱοὶ ἑπτὰ
14 καὶ θυγατέρες τρεῖς· καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὴν μὲν πρώτην, Ἡμέραν· τὴν
15 δὲ δευτέραν, Κασσίαν· τὴν δὲ τρίτην, Ἀμαλθείας κέρας. Καὶ οὐχ
εὑρέθησαν κατὰ τὰς Ἰὼβ θυγατέρας (καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ) βελ-
τίους αὐτῶν ὑπὸ τὴν ὑπ᾿ οὐρανόν· ἔδωκε δὲ αὐταῖς ὁ πατὴρ κλη-
ρονομίαν ἐν τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς αὐτῶν. Ἔζησε δὲ Ἰὼβ μετὰ τὴν πλη-
γὴν ἔτη ἑκατὸν τεσσαράκοντα. Τὰ δὲ πάντα ἃ ἔζη ἔτη διακόσια
τεσσαράκοντα ὀκτώ. Καὶ ἴδεν Ἰὼβ τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοὺς
17 υἱοὺς τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ, τετάρτην γενεάν. Καὶ ἐτελεύτησεν Ἰὼβ
πρεσβύτερος, καὶ πλήρης ἡμερῶν. Γέγραπται δὲ πάλιν ἀναστήσε-
σθαι αὐτὸν μεθ᾿ ὧν ἀνίστησιν ὁ Κύριος. Οὗτος ἑρμηνεύεται ἐκ
τῆς Συριακῆς βίβλου, ἐν μὲν γῇ κατοικῶν τῇ Αὐσιτίδι, ἐπὶ τοῖς
ὁρίοις τῆς Ἰδουμαίας καὶ Ἀραβίας· προϋπῆρχε δὲ αὐτῷ ὄνομα
Ἰωβάβ. Λαβὼν δὲ γυναῖκα Ἀράβισσαν, γεννᾷ υἱὸν ᾧ ὄνομα Ἐν-

## CHAPTER XLII.

**7** ...[And] it came to pass after the Lord had spoken all these words unto Job, that the Lord said to Eliphaz the Temanite: Thou hast sinned, and thy two friends; for ye have not spoken before Me anything true, as My servant Job [hath done].
**8** Now therefore, take unto yourselves seven bullocks and seven rams, and go unto My servant Job, and make a burnt offering for yourselves. And Job My servant shall pray for you; for if I receive not his countenance, and if [it be] not for his sake, I would have destroyed you. For ye have not spoken unto Me anything good concerning My servant Job.
**9** So Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Minaean went and did (for themselves) as the Lord commanded them; and [the Lord] forgave their sin through Job.
**10** And the Lord increased Job; and when he had prayed for his friends, He forgave them their sin. And the Lord gave unto Job double all things which he had before (for a doubling).
**11** Then heard all his brethren and all his sisters all the things which had befallen him, and they came unto him, and all (those) who had known him from the first. And having eaten and drunk with him, they comforted him; and they marvelled at all the evils which the Lord had brought upon him. And each man gave him one ewe-lamb, and a golden tetradrachm uncoined.
**12** And the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning. And his possessions were: fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, one thousand yoke of oxen, and one thousand female asses, ranging [freely].
**13** And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.
**14** And he called the name of the first, Day; and the name of the second, Cassia; and the name of the third, Amalthea’s Horn.
**15** And there were not found women more beautiful than the daughters of Job (and his sons) under heaven. And their father gave them an inheritance among their brethren.
**16** And Job lived after the plague one hundred and forty years. And all the years which he lived were two hundred and forty-eight. And Job saw his sons, and his sons’ sons, [even] to the fourth generation.
**17** And Job died, an old man, and full of days. And it is written that he shall rise again with those whom the Lord raiseth up. This man is interpreted from the Syriac book, dwelling in the land of Ausitis, on the borders of Idumaea and Arabia. And his former name was Jobab. And having taken an Arabian wife, he begat a son whose name was En-
