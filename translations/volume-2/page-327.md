γραμματεὺς τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ ὁ προστάτης τοῦ ἱερέως τοῦ μεγάλου, καὶ ἐξεκένωσαν τὸ γλωσσόκομον, καὶ κατέστησαν εἰς τὸν τόπον αὐτοῦ· οὕτως ἐποιοῦν ἡμέραν ἐξ ἡμέρας, καὶ συνήγαγον ἀργύριον πολύ. Καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὸ ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ Ἰωδαὲ ὁ ἱερεὺς τοῖς 12
ποιοῦσι τὰ ἔργα εἰς τὴν ἐργασίαν οἴκου Κυρίου. Καὶ ἐμισθοῦντο λατόμους καὶ τέκτονας ἐπισκευάσαι τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου, καὶ χαλκεῖς σιδήρου καὶ χαλκοῦ ἐπισκευάσαι τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου. Καὶ ἐποιοῦν οἱ 13
ποιοῦντες τὰ ἔργα, καὶ ἀνέβη μῆκος τῶν ἔργων ἐν χερσὶν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἀνέστησαν τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου ἐπὶ τὴν στάσιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐνίσχυσαν. Καὶ ὡς συνετέλεσαν, ἤνεγκαν πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα καὶ πρὸς 14
Ἰωδαὲ τὸ κατάλοιπον τοῦ ἀργυρίου, καὶ ἐποίησαν σκεύη εἰς οἶκον Κυρίου, σκεύη λειτουργικὰ ὁλοκαυτωμάτων, καὶ θυΐσκας χρυσᾶς καὶ ἀργυρᾶς, καὶ ἀνήνεγκαν ὁλοκαυτώσεις ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου διαπαντὸς, πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας Ἰωδαέ. Καὶ ἐγήρασεν Ἰωδαὲ πλήρης ἡμε- 15
ρῶν, καὶ ἐτελεύτησεν ὢν ἐτῶν ἑκατὸν καὶ τριάκοντα ἐν τῷ τελευτῶν αὐτόν. Καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν ἐν πόλει Δαυὶδ μετὰ τῶν βασιλέων, 16
ὅτι ἐποίησεν ἀγαθωσύνην μετὰ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ μετὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ τὴν τελευτὴν Ἰωδαὲ εἰσῆλθον οἱ 17
ἄρχοντες Ἰούδα, καὶ προσεκύνησαν τὸν βασιλέα· τότε ἐπήκουσεν αὐτοῖς ὁ βασιλεύς, καὶ ἐγκατέλειπον τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου Θεοῦ τῶν 18
πατέρων αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐδούλευσον τοῖς εἰδώλοις καὶ ταῖς Ἀσάρταις· καὶ ἐγένετο ὀργὴ ἐπὶ Ἰούδαν, καὶ ἐπὶ Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ταύτῃ. Καὶ ἀπέστειλε πρὸς αὐτοὺς προφήτας ἐπιστρέψαι πρὸς Κύ- 19
ριον, καὶ οὐκ ἤκουσαν· καὶ διεμαρτύρατο αὐτοῖς, καὶ οὐκ ἤκουσαν. Καὶ πνεῦμα Θεοῦ ἐνέδυσε τὸν Ἀζαρίαν τὸν τοῦ Ἰωδαὲ τὸν ἱερέα, 20
καὶ ἀνέστη ἐπάνω τοῦ λαοῦ, καὶ εἶπε· τάδε λέγει Κύριος· τί παραπορεύεσθε τὰς ἐντολὰς Κυρίου; καὶ οὐκ εὐοδωθήσεσθε· ὅτι ἐγκατελείπετε τὸν Κύριον, καὶ ἐγκαταλείψει ὑμᾶς. Καὶ ἐπέθεντο 21
αὐτῷ, καὶ ἐλιθοβόλησαν αὐτὸν δι᾿ ἐντολῆς Ἰωὰς τοῦ βασιλέως ἐν αὐλῇ οἴκου Κυρίου. Καὶ οὐκ ἐμνήσθη Ἰωὰς τοῦ ἐλέους οὗ ἐποίη- 22
σε μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ Ἰωδαὲ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐθανάτωσε τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ· καὶ ὡς ἀπέθνησκεν, εἶπεν· ἴδοι Κύριος καὶ κρινέτω. Καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ τὴν συντέλειαν τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ ἀνέβη ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν δύναμις Συ- 23
ρίας, καὶ ἦλθεν ἐπὶ Ἰούδαν καὶ ἐπὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ κατέφθειραν πάντας τοὺς ἄρχοντας τοῦ λαοῦ ἐν τῷ λαῷ, καὶ πάντα τὰ σκῦλα αὐτῶν ἀπέστειλαν τῷ βασιλεῖ Δαμασκοῦ, ὅτι ἐν ὀλίγοις ἀνδρά- 24

**CHAPTER XXIV. OF THE KINGDOMS OF JUDAH. II.**

¹¹ ...the king’s scribe, and the overseer of the chief priest [came], and they emptied the money-chest, and set it again in its place. And this they did day by day, and gathered much silver.

¹² And the king and Jehoiada the priest gave it unto them that did the work, even to those who labored for the House of the Lord. And they hired masons and carpenters to repair the House of the Lord, and workmen of iron and of bronze to repair the House of the Lord.

¹³ And the workmen wrought, and the work advanced greatly in their hands; and they set up the House of the Lord in its [former] state, and strengthened it.

¹⁴ And when they had finished, they brought the remainder of the silver unto the king and to Jehoiada; and they made thereof vessels for the House of the Lord, even vessels for the liturgical service of burnt offerings, and golden and silver censers. And they offered burnt offerings in the House of the Lord continually, all the days of Jehoiada.

¹⁵ And Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days, and died, being an hundred and thirty years old when he departed [this life].

¹⁶ And they buried him in the city of David amongst the kings, because he had shown goodness with Israel, and with God, and with His House.

¹⁷ And it came to pass after the death of Jehoiada, that the princes of Judah came, and did obeisance unto the king. Then the king hearkened unto them.

¹⁸ And they forsook the House of the Lord God of their fathers, and served idols and the Asherim; and wrath came upon Judah and upon Jerusalem on that day.

¹⁹ Yet He sent prophets unto them, to bring them again unto the Lord; and they hearkened not. And He testified against them, but they would not hear.

²⁰ And the Spirit of God clothed Azariah, the son of Jehoiada the priest; and he stood above the people, and said, “Thus saith the Lord: Why transgress ye the commandments of the Lord? Therefore shall ye not prosper. Because ye have forsaken the Lord, He shall also forsake you.”

²¹ And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones by the commandment of Joash the king, in the court of the House of the Lord.

²² And Joash remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his foster-father had shown him, but slew his son. And as he died, he said, “The Lord look upon [this], and judge!”

²³ And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the host of Syria came up against him; and they came unto Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all their spoil unto the king of Damascus.

²⁴ For with but a small company of men came the host of Syria.
