κᾶ, καὶ ταῦτα ἡγίασεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Δαυὶδ τῷ Κυρίῳ μετὰ τοῦ ἀρ- 11
γυρίου καὶ τοῦ χρυσίου οὗ ἔλαβεν ἐκ πάντων τῶν ἐθνῶν, ἐξ ᾿Ιδου-
μαίας, καὶ Μωάβ, καὶ ἐξ υἱῶν ᾿Αμμῶν, καὶ ἐκ τῶν ἀλλοφύλων,
καὶ ἐξ ᾿Αμαλήκ. Καὶ ᾿Αβισὰ υἱὸς Σαρουίας ἐπάταξε τὴν ᾿Ιδου- 12
μαίαν ἐν κοιλάδι τῶν ἁλῶν, ὀκτωκαίδεκα χιλιάδας. Καὶ ἔθετο ἐν 13
τῇ κοιλάδι φρουράς, καὶ ἦσαν πάντες οἱ ᾿Ιδουμαῖοι παῖδες Δαυίδ.
Καὶ ἔσωζε Κύριος τὸν Δαυὶδ ἐν πᾶσιν οἷς ἐπορεύετο. Καὶ ἐβασί- 14
λευσε Δαυὶδ ἐπὶ πάντα ᾿Ισραήλ, καὶ ἦν ποιῶν κρίμα καὶ δικαιοσύνην
τῷ παντὶ λαῷ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ᾿Ιωὰβ υἱὸς Σαρουίας ἐπὶ τῆς στρατιᾶς, 15
καὶ ᾿Ιωσαφὰτ υἱὸς ᾿Αχιλουδ ὁ ὑπομνηματογράφος, καὶ Σαδὼκ υἱὸς 16
᾿Αχιτὼβ, καὶ ᾿Αχιμέλεχ υἱὸς ᾿Αβιάθαρ ἱερεῖς, καὶ Σουσὰ γραμ-
ματεύς, καὶ Βαναίας υἱὸς ᾿Ιωδαὲ ἐπὶ τοῦ Χερθηῖ, καὶ τοῦ Φαλ- 17
λεθὶ· καὶ υἱοὶ Δαυὶδ οἱ πρῶτοι διάδοχοι τοῦ βασιλέως.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΘʹ. ΧΙΧ.

ΚΑὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ ταῦτα ἀπέθανε Ναὰς βασιλεὺς υἱῶν ᾿Αμ- 1
μῶν, καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν ᾿Ανὰν υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἀντὶ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπε 2
·Δαυίδ· ποιήσω ἔλεος μετὰ ᾿Ανὰν υἱοῦ Ναάς, ὡς ἐποίησεν ὁ πατὴρ
αὐτοῦ μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ ἔλεος. Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ἀγγέλους Δαυὶδ τοῦ πα-
ρακαλέσαι αὐτὸν περὶ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἦλθον παῖδες Δαυὶδ
εἰς γῆν υἱῶν ᾿Αμμῶν πρὸς ᾿Ανὰν τοῦ παρακαλέσαι αὐτόν. Καὶ εἶ- 3
πον οἱ ἄρχοντες υἱῶν ᾿Αμμῶν πρὸς ᾿Ανάν· μὴ δοξάζων Δαυὶδ τὸν
πατέρα σου ἐναντίον σου, ἀπέστειλέ σοι παρακαλοῦντας; οὐχ ὅπως
ἐρευνήσωσι τὴν πόλιν, καὶ τοῦ κατασκοπῆσαι τὴν γῆν ἦλθον παῖ-
δες αὐτοῦ πρὸς σέ; Καὶ ἔλαβεν ᾿Ανὰν τοὺς παῖδας Δαυίδ, καὶ ἐξύ- 4
ρησεν αὐτούς, καὶ ἀφεῖλε τῶν μανδυῶν αὐτῶν τὸ ἥμισυ ἕως τῆς
ἀναβολῆς, καὶ ἀπέστειλεν αὐτούς. Καὶ ἦλθον ἀπαγγεῖλαι τῷ Δαυὶδ 5
περὶ τῶν ἀνδρῶν, καὶ ἀπέστειλεν εἰς ἀπάντησιν αὐτοῖς, ὅτι ἦσαν
ἠτιμωμένοι σφόδρα. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ βασιλεὺς· καθίσατε ἐν ᾿Ιεριχὼ
ἕως τοῦ ἀνατεῖλαι τοὺς πώγωνας ὑμῶν, καὶ ἀνακάμψατε. Καὶ εἶ- 6
δον υἱοὶ ᾿Αμμῶν, ὅτι ἠσχύνθη λαὸς Δαυὶδ, καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ᾿Ανὰν,
καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ ᾿Αμμῶν, χίλια τάλαντα ἀργυρίου τοῦ μισθώσασθαι αὐ-
τοῖς ἐκ Συρίας Μεσοποταμίας, καὶ ἐκ Συρίας Μααχὰ, καὶ ἐκ Σου-
θὰλ ἅρματα καὶ ἱππεῖς· καὶ ἐμισθώσαντο ἑαυτοῖς δύο καὶ τριάκον- 7
τα χιλιάδας ἁρμάτων, καὶ τὸν βασιλέα Μααχὰ, καὶ τὸν λαὸν αὐ-

**11** And these things King David consecrated unto the Lord, with the silver and the gold which he had taken from all the nations: from Idumea, and Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.
**12** And Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, smote the Idumeans in the Valley of Salt, even eighteen thousand [men].
**13** And he put garrisons in the valley; and all the Idumeans became servants to David. And the Lord preserved David whithersoever he went.
**14** So David reigned over all Israel, and he did judgment and righteousness unto all his people.
**15** And Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was over the army;
**16** and Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, was recorder; and Zadok, the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech, the son of Abiathar, were the priests;
**17** and Shusha was scribe; and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were the chief ministers to the king.

**Chapter 19**

**1** And it came to pass after these things, that Nahash, the king of the children of Ammon, died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.
**2** And David said, "I will show kindness unto Hanun, the son of Nahash, for his father showed kindness unto me." And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father; and the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon, to Hanun, to comfort him.
**3** Then said the princes of the children of Ammon to Hanun, "Doth David honor thy father before thee, that he hath sent unto thee comforters? Hath he not rather sent his servants unto thee to search the city, and to spy out the land?"
**4** Whereupon Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off half of their garments unto their buttocks, and sent them away.
**5** And when they came to tell David concerning the men, he sent to meet them, for they were greatly disgraced. And the king said, "Tarry ye at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return."
**6** And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious unto David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire for themselves chariots and horsemen from Mesopotamia of Syria, and from Maachah of Syria, and from Suthal.
**7** And they hired for themselves two and thirty thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah, and his people;
