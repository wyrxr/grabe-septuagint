7 Κύριον ἐν χειρὶ Ἀσάφ, καὶ τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτοῦ. ὨΔΗ. 8
Ἐξομολογεῖσθε τῷ Κυρίῳ· ἐπικαλεῖσθε αὐτὸν ἐν ὀνόματι αὐτοῦ· γνωρί- 
σατε ἐν λαοῖς τὰ ἐπιτηδεύματα αὐτοῦ. 9 Ἄσατε αὐτῷ, καὶ ὑμνή-
σατε αὐτῷ· διηγήσασθε πᾶσι τὰ θαυμάσια αὐτοῦ, ἃ ἐποίησε Κύ-
ριος· 10 αἰνεῖτε ἐν ὀνόματι ἁγίῳ αὐτοῦ· εὐφρανθήσεται καρδία ζη-
τούσα τὴν εὐδοκίαν αὐτοῦ· 11 ζητήσατε τὸν Κύριον, καὶ ἰσχύσατε·
ζητήσατε τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ διαπαντός· 12 μνημονεύσατε τὰ θαυ-
μάσια αὐτοῦ, ἃ ἐποίησε· τέρατα, καὶ κρίματα τοῦ στόματος αὐ-
τοῦ· 13 σπέρμα Ἰσραὴλ παῖδες αὐτοῦ· υἱοὶ Ἰακὼβ ἐκλεκτοὶ αὐτοῦ·
14 αὐτὸς Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν· ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ τὰ κρίματα αὐτοῦ·
15 μνημονεύων εἰς αἰῶνα διαθήκης αὐτοῦ· λόγον αὐτοῦ ὃν ἐνετείλα-
το εἰς χιλίας γενεάς· 16 ὃν διέθετο τῷ Ἀβραάμ, καὶ τὸν ὅρκον αὐ-
τοῦ τῷ Ἰσαάκ· 17 ἔστησεν αὐτὸν τῷ Ἰακὼβ εἰς πρόσταγμα· τῷ Ἰσ-
ραὴλ διαθήκην αἰώνιον, 18 λέγων· σοὶ δώσω τὴν γῆν Χαναάν, σχοίνι-
σμα κληρονομίας ὑμῶν· 19 ἐν τῷ γενέσθαι αὐτοὺς ὀλιγοστοὺς ἀριθμῷ,
ὡς ἐσμικρύνθησαν, καὶ παρῴκησαν ἐν αὐτῇ· 20 καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν ἀπὸ
ἔθνους εἰς ἔθνος, καὶ ἀπὸ βασιλείας εἰς λαὸν ἕτερον. 21 Οὐκ ἀφῆκεν
ἄνδρα τοῦ δυναστεῦσαι αὐτούς· καὶ ἤλεγξεν ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν βασιλεῖς.
22 Μὴ ἅψησθε τῶν χριστῶν μου, καὶ ἐν τοῖς προφήταις μου μὴ πο-
νηρεύεσθε. 23 Ἄσατε τῷ Κυρίῳ πᾶσα ἡ γῆ· ἀναγγείλατε ἐξ ἡμέρας
εἰς ἡμέραν τὸ σωτήριον αὐτοῦ. 24 Ἐξηγεῖσθε ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι τὴν δό-
ξαν αὐτοῦ· ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς λαοῖς τὰ θαυμάσια αὐτοῦ. 25 Ὅτι μέγας
Κύριος, καὶ αἰνετὸς σφόδρα· φοβερὸς ἐστιν ἐπὶ πάντας τοὺς θεούς.
26 Ὅτι πάντες οἱ θεοὶ τῶν ἐθνῶν εἴδωλα· καὶ ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν οὐρανὸν
ἐποίησε. 27 Δόξα καὶ ἔπαινος κατὰ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ, ἰσχὺς καὶ καύ-
χημα ἐν τόπῳ αὐτοῦ. 28 Δότε τῷ Κυρίῳ, αἱ πατριαὶ τῶν ἐθνῶν, δό-
τε τῷ Κυρίῳ δόξαν καὶ ἰσχύν. 29 Δότε τῷ Κυρίῳ δόξαν ὀνόματος
αὐτοῦ· λάβετε δῶρα, καὶ ἐνέγκατε κατὰ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ, καὶ προσ-
κυνήσατε τῷ Κυρίῳ ἐν αὐλαῖς ἁγίαις αὐτοῦ. 30 Φοβηθήτω ἀπὸ προ-
σώπου αὐτοῦ πᾶσα ἡ γῆ· κατορθωθήτω ἡ γῆ, καὶ μὴ σαλευθήτω.
31 Εὐφρανθήτω ὁ οὐρανός, καὶ ἀγαλλιάσθω ἡ γῆ· καὶ εἰπάτωσαν ἐν
τοῖς ἔθνεσι, Κύριος ἐβασίλευσε. 32 Βοήσει ἡ θάλασσα σὺν τῷ πλη-
ρώματι, καὶ ξύλον ἀγροῦ, καὶ πάντα τὰ ἐν αὐτῷ. 33 Τότε εὐφραν-
θήσεται τὰ ξύλα τοῦ δρυμοῦ ἀπὸ προσώπου Κυρίου, ὅτι ἦλθε κρῖ-
ναι τὴν γῆν. 34 Ἐξομολογεῖσθε τῷ Κυρίῳ, ὅτι ἀγαθόν, ὅτι εἰς τὸν
αἰῶνα τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ· 35 Καὶ εἴπατε· σῶσον ἡμᾶς, ὁ Θεὸς τῆς σω-

**Chapter 16**

**7** ...Lord in the hand of Asaph, and of his brethren.

**A Song**
**8** Give thanks unto the Lord; call upon His Name; make known among the peoples His deeds.
**9** Sing unto Him, and chant unto Him; recount to all His wondrous works, which the Lord hath wrought.
**10** Praise ye in His holy Name; the heart of them that seek His good pleasure shall rejoice.
**11** Seek ye the Lord, and be ye strengthened; seek ye His face continually.
**12** Remember ye His wondrous works, which He hath done; His wonders, and the judgments of His mouth.
**13** O ye seed of Israel, His servants; ye sons of Jacob, His chosen.
**14** He is the Lord our God; throughout all the earth are His judgments.
**15** He is mindful forever of His covenant; His word which He commanded to a thousand generations;
**16** Which He established with Abraham, and His oath unto Isaac;
**17** And He confirmed it unto Jacob for a statute; unto Israel for an everlasting covenant,
**18** Saying, "Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the measured portion of your inheritance;"
**19** When they were but a few in number, as they were diminished, and sojourned therein.
**20** And they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people.
**21** He suffered no man to oppress them; and He reproved kings for their sakes,
**22** [Saying,] "Touch not My anointed ones, and do My prophets no harm."
**23** Sing unto the Lord, all the earth; declare His salvation from day to day.
**24** Declare His glory among the nations; His wondrous works among all peoples.
**25** For great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised; He is to be feared above all gods.
**26** For all the gods of the nations are idols; but our God made the heavens.
**27** Glory and praise are before His face, strength and exultation in His place.
**28** Give unto the Lord, ye kindreds of the nations, give unto the Lord glory and strength.
**29** Give unto the Lord the glory due unto His Name; take gifts, and bring them before His face, and worship the Lord in His holy courts.
**30** Let all the earth tremble before His face; let the earth be established, and not be moved.
**31** Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; and let them say among the nations, "The Lord hath reigned!"
**32** Let the sea roar, and the fullness thereof; and the tree of the field, and all that is therein.
**33** Then shall the trees of the forest rejoice before the Lord, for He cometh to judge the earth.
**34** Give thanks unto the Lord, for He is good, for His mercy endureth forever.
**35** And say ye, "Save us, O God of our salva-
