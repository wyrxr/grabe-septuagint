ΚΕΦ. ΙΕ΄. XV.

ἡ θάλασσα ἡ μεγάλη ὅρια. Ταῦτα τὰ ὅρια υἱῶν Ἰούδα κύκλῳ
13 κατὰ δήμους αὐτῶν. Καὶ τῷ Χάλεβ υἱῷ Ἰεφοννῆ ἔδωκε μερίδα
ἐν μέσῳ υἱῶν Ἰούδα διὰ προστάγματος τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ ἔδωκεν
αὐτῷ Ἰησοῦς τὴν πόλιν Ἀρβὲχ, μητρόπολιν Ἐνάκ· αὕτη ἐστὶ
14 Χεβρών. Καὶ ἐξωλόθρευσεν ἐκεῖθεν Χάλεβ υἱὸς Ἰεφοννῆ τοὺς τρεῖς
υἱοὺς Ἐνάκ, τὸν Σουσαΐ, καὶ τὸν Θολμαΐ, καὶ τὸν Ἀχιμᾶ, γεν-
15 νήματα τῶν Ἐνάκ. Καὶ ἀνέβη ἐκεῖθεν Χάλεβ ἐπὶ τοὺς κατοικοῦν-
τας Δαβείρ· τὸ δὲ ὄνομα Δαβείρ τὸ πρότερον ἦν πόλις γραμμά-
16 των. Καὶ εἶπε Χάλεβ· ὃς ἂν λάβῃ τὴν πόλιν τῶν γραμμάτων
καὶ κυριεύσῃ αὐτῆς, καὶ δώσω αὐτῷ Ἀχσὰν θυγατέρα μου εἰς
17 γυναῖκα. Καὶ ἔλαβεν αὐτὴν Γοθονιὴλ υἱὸς Κενὲζ, ἀδελφοῦ Χάλεβ,
ὁ νεώτερος· καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ τὴν Ἀχσὰν θυγατέρα αὐτοῦ αὐτῷ
18 εἰς γυναῖκα. Καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐν τῷ εἰσπορεύεσθαι αὐτὴν καὶ συνε-
βουλεύσατο αὐτῷ, λέγουσα· αἰτήσομαι τὸν πατέρα μου ἀγρόν. Καὶ
19 ἐζήτησεν ἀπὸ τοῦ ὄνου· καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ Χάλεβ· τί ἐστί σοι; Καὶ
εἶπεν αὐτῷ, δός μοι εὐλογίας, ὅτι εἰς γῆν Ναγὲβ δέδωκάς με· δὸς
μοι Γωλὰθ-μάϊμ. Καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῇ Χάλεβ τὴν Γωλὰθ τὴν ἄνω, καὶ
20 τὴν Γωλὰθ τὴν κάτω. Αὕτη ἡ κληρονομία φυλῆς υἱῶν Ἰούδα κατὰ δή-
21 μους αὐτῶν. Ἐγενήθησαν δὲ αἱ πόλεις αὐτῶν πόλεις πρὸς τῇ φυλῇ υἱ-
22 ῶν Ἰούδα ἐπὶ ὁρίων Ἐδὼμ ἐπὶ τῆς ἐρήμου, Καβσεὴλ, καὶ Ἐδραΐμ, καὶ

**Joshua 15**

The Great Sea [shall be] the boundary. These are the boundaries of the children of Judah round about according to their families.

<sup>13</sup> And to Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, did he give a portion in the midst of the children of Judah, by the commandment of God; and Joshua gave unto him the city of Arba, the metropolis of Enak (this is Hebron).
<sup>14</sup> And from thence Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, rooted out the three sons of Enak, namely, Shishai, and Talmai, and Ahiman, the offspring of Enak.
<sup>15</sup> And Caleb went up from thence against those that dwelt in Debir; (now the name of Debir beforetime was Kirjath-Sepher, [which is] the city of letters).
<sup>16</sup> And Caleb said, Whosoever shall smite the city of letters and possess it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.
<sup>17</sup> And Othniel, the son of Kenaz, the younger brother of Caleb, took it; and he gave him Achsah his daughter [unto] him to wife.
<sup>18</sup> And it came to pass, when she entered [into her new abode], that she urged him, saying, I will ask of my father a field.
<sup>19</sup> And she requested from the ass; and Caleb said unto her, What aileth thee? And she said unto him, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me into a land of Negeb [a dry land]; give me springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.

<sup>20</sup> This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families.
<sup>21</sup> Now their cities, even the cities toward the tribe of the children of Judah upon the borders of Edom toward the wilderness, were: Kabzeel, and Edraim, and Jagur, and Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah,
<sup>23</sup> and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnazir, and Telem, and Balloth,
<sup>25</sup> and Hazor the New, and the city of Aseron (this is Hazor); Amam, and Samaa, and Moladah, and Asergaddah, and Asemon, and Beth-pheleth, and Asrsoula, and Beersheba (with their villages, and their farmsteads);
<sup>29</sup> Baalah, and Aueim, and Asem,
<sup>30</sup> and Eltholad, and Chesil, and Hormah, and Ziklag, and Bedethea, and Sansannah, and Labaoth, and Seleim, and Ain, and Rimmon;
<sup>32</sup> All the cities were twenty and nine, with their villages.
<sup>33</sup> In the lowlands: Eshtaol, and Zorah, and Ashnah, (and Ramen), and Zanoah,
<sup>35</sup> and En-gannim, Tappuah, and Enam, and Jarmuth, and Adullam, (and Nemphah), and Socoh, and Azekah, and Shaaraim, and Adithaim, and Gederah, with her farmsteads;
<sup>36</sup> fourteen cities, with their villages.
<sup>37</sup> Zennah, and Hadashah, and Migdal-gad,
<sup>38</sup> and Dilaan, and Mizpah, and Jektheel,
<sup>39</sup> and Lachish, and Bozkath, and Eglon, and Cabbon, and Lahmam, and Chelil,
<sup>40</sup> and Gederoth, and Beth-dagon, and Naamah, and Makkedah;

**Joshua 16**

<sup>1</sup> And the boundaries of the children of Joseph were from the Jordan of Jericho, from the waters of Jericho, from the east, the wilderness; and it shall ascend from Jericho to the hill country (even the wilderness) unto Bethel.
<sup>2</sup> And it shall go forth from Bethel to Luz, and shall pass from the north unto the borders of Acharei, even unto Beth-horon the Upper, and unto Gezer.
