ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ ΚΕΦ. ΛΕ΄.
19 αὐτοῦ ἐκάλεσεν αὐτόν, Βενιαμίν. Ἀπέθανε δὲ Ῥαχήλ, καὶ ἐτάφη
20 ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ Ἐφραθᾶ· αὕτη ἐστὶ Βηθλεέμ. Καὶ ἔστησεν Ἰακὼβ
21 στήλην ἐπὶ τοῦ μνημείου αὐτῆς· αὕτη ἐστὶν ἡ στήλη μνημείου Ῥα-
22 χὴλ ἕως τῆς σήμερον ἡμέρας. Καὶ ἀπῆρεν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἔπηξε τὴν
23 σκηνὴν αὐτοῦ ἐπέκεινα τοῦ πύργου Γαδέρ. Ἐγένετο δὲ ἡνίκα κα-
24 τώκησεν Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τῇ γῇ ἐκείνῃ, ἐπορεύθη Ῥουβήν, καὶ ἐκοιμή-
25 θη μετὰ Βαλλᾶς τῆς παλλακῆς τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἤκουσεν
26 Ἰσραήλ, καὶ πονηρὸν ἐφάνη ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ. Ἦσαν δὲ οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰα-
27 κώβ, δώδεκα. Υἱοὶ Λείας· πρωτότοκος Ἰακὼβ Ῥουβήν, Συμεών,
28 Λευΐ, Ἰούδας, Ἰσσάχαρ, Ζαβουλών. Υἱοὶ δὲ Ῥαχήλ, Ἰωσὴφ καὶ
29 Βενιαμίν. Υἱοὶ δὲ Βαλλᾶς παιδίσκης Ῥαχήλ, Δὰν καὶ Νεφθαλείμ.
30 Υἱοὶ δὲ Ζελφᾶς παιδίσκης Λείας, Γὰδ καὶ Ἀσήρ. Οὗτοι οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰα-
31 κώβ, οἳ ἐγένοντο αὐτῷ ἐν Μεσοποταμίᾳ τῆς Συρίας. Ἦλθε δὲ Ἰα-
32 κὼβ πρὸς Ἰσαὰκ τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ εἰς Μαμβρῆ, (εἰς) πόλιν τοῦ
33 πεδίου· αὕτη ἐστὶ Χεβρὼν ἐν γῇ Χαναάν, οὗ παρῴκησεν Ἀβραὰμ
34 καὶ Ἰσαάκ. Ἐγένοντο δὲ αἱ ἡμέραι Ἰσαάκ, ἃς ἔζησεν, ἔτη ἑκα-
35 τὸν ὀγδοήκοντα· καὶ ἐκλιπὼν Ἰσαὰκ ἀπέθανε, καὶ προσετέθη πρὸς
36 τὸ γένος αὐτοῦ πρεσβύτερος καὶ πλήρης ἡμερῶν· καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν
37 Ἠσαῦ καὶ Ἰακώβ, οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. ΛΣ΄. XXXVI.

1 ΑΥΤΑΙ δὲ αἱ γενέσεις Ἠσαῦ· (αὐτός ἐστιν Ἐδώμ.)
2 Ἠσαῦ δὲ ἔλαβε γυναῖκας ἑαυτῷ ἀπὸ τῶν θυγατέρων τῶν Χαναναίων,
3 τὴν Ἀδὰ θυγατέρα Αἴλων τοῦ Χετταίου, καὶ τὴν Ὀλιβεμὰ θυ-
4 γατέρα Ἀνὰ τοῦ υἱοῦ Σεβεγὼν τοῦ Εὐαίου, καὶ τὴν Βασεμμαθ
5 θυγατέρα Ἰσμαήλ, ἀδελφὴν Ναβαιώθ. Ἔτεκε δὲ Ἀδὰ τῷ Ἠσαῦ
6 τὸν Ἐλιφάς· καὶ Βασεμμαθ ἔτεκε τὸν Ῥαγουήλ· καὶ Ὀλιβεμὰ
7 ἔτεκε τὸν Ἰεούς, καὶ τὸν Ἰεγλόμ, καὶ τὸν Κορέ· οὗτοι υἱοὶ Ἠ-
8 σαῦ, οἳ ἐγένοντο αὐτῷ ἐν γῇ Χαναάν. Ἔλαβε δὲ Ἠσαῦ τὰς γυ-
9 ναῖκας αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας αὐτοῦ,
10 καὶ πάντα τὰ σώματα τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντα τὰ ὑπάρχον-
11 τα αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντα τὰ κτήνη, καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐκτήσατο, καὶ ὅσα
12 περιεποιήσατο ἐν γῇ Χαναάν, καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἐκ γῆς Χαναὰν ἀπὸ
13 προσώπου Ἰακὼβ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ· ἦν γὰρ αὐτῶν τὰ ὑπάρχον-
14 τα πολλὰ τοῦ οἰκεῖν ἅμα, καὶ οὐκ ἠδύνατο ἡ γῆ τῆς παροικήσεως

19 his [father] called him, Benjamin.
And Rachel died, and was buried
20 on the way to Ephratha; this is Bethlehem.
And Jacob set up
21 a pillar upon her tomb;
this is the pillar of Rachel's tomb
22 unto this present day.
And Israel journeyed forth, and pitched his
23 tent beyond the tower of Gader.
And it came to pass, when
24 Israel dwelt in that land,
that Reuben went and lay
25 with Bilhah, his father's concubine;
and Israel heard [of it],
26 and it appeared grievous in his sight.

Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:
27 The sons of Leah:
Reuben, Jacob's firstborn,
Simeon,
28 Levi,
Judah,
Issachar,
[and] Zebulun.
And the sons of Rachel:
Joseph
29 and Benjamin.
And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's maidservant:
Dan
and Naphtali.
30 And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's maidservant:
Gad
and Asher.
These are the sons of Jacob,
31 who were born unto him in Mesopotamia of Syria.

And Jacob came
32 unto Isaac his father, to Mamre, [to] the city of the
33 plain; this is Hebron in the land of Canaan,
where Abraham sojourned
34 and Isaac.
And the days of Isaac, which he lived, were a hundred
35 and eighty years;
and Isaac expired and died, and was gathered unto
36 his people, being old and full of days;
and Esau and Jacob, his sons,
37 buried him.

**CHAPTER 36**

1 Now these are the generations of Esau;
(he is Edom.)
2 And Esau took for himself wives
of the daughters of the Canaanites:
3 [namely,] Adah, the daughter of Aelon the Hittite,
and Olibemah, the daughter
4 of Ana, the son of Sebeon the Hivite,
and Basemmath,
5 the daughter of Ishmael, the sister of Nabaioth.

And Adah bore to Esau
6 Eliphaz;
and Basemmath bore Raguel;
and Olibemah
7 bore Jeous, and Jeglom, and Kore.
These are the sons of Esau,
8 who were born unto him in the land of Canaan.

And Esau took his wives,
9 and his sons, and his daughters,
10 and all the persons of his household,
and all his possessions,
11 and all his cattle,
and all that he had acquired,
and all that
12 he had gotten for himself in the land of Canaan,
and went from the land of Canaan
