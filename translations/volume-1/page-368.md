ΚΕΦ. ΚΔʹ. ΔΕΥΤΕΡΟΝΟΜΙΟΝ 353
ἀναγγείλωσιν ὑμῖν οἱ ἱερεῖς οἱ Λευῖται· ὃν τρόπον ἐνετειλάμην
ὑμῖν, φυλάξεσθε ποιεῖν. Μνήσθητι ὅσα ἐποίησε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς σου 9
τῇ Μαριάμ ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ, ἐκπορευομένων ὑμῶν ἐξ Αἰγύπτου. Ἐὰν 10
ὀφείλημα ᾗ ἐν τῷ πλησίον σου, ὀφείλημα ἐστιόν τι, οὐκ εἰσελεύσῃ
εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν αὐτοῦ, ἐνεχυράσαι τὸ ἐνέχυρον αὐτοῦ· ἔξω στήσῃ, 11
καὶ ὁ ἄνθρωπος οὗ τὸ δάνειόν σου ἐστιν ἐν αὐτῷ, ἐξοίσει σοι τὸ
ἐνέχυρον ἔξω. Ἐὰν δὲ ὁ ἄνθρωπος πένηται, οὐ κοιμηθήσῃ ἐν τῷ 12
ἐνεχύρῳ αὐτοῦ· ἀποδόσει ἀποδώσεις αὐτῷ τὸ ἱμάτιον αὐτοῦ περὶ 13
δυσμὰς ἡλίου, καὶ κοιμηθήσεται ἐν τῷ ἱματίῳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ εὐλο-
γήσει σε, καὶ σοὶ ἔσται ἐλεημοσύνη ἐναντίον Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ σου.
Οὐκ ἀποστερήσεις μισθὸν πένητος καὶ ἐνδεοῦς ἐκ τῶν ἀδελφῶν 14
σου, ἢ ἐκ τῶν προσηλύτων τῶν ἐν τῇ γῇ σου ἐν ταῖς πόλεσί σου·
αὐθημερὸν ἀποδώσεις τὸν μισθὸν αὐτοῦ, οὐκ ἐπιδύσεται ὁ ἥλιος 15
ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ, ὅτι πένης ἐστὶ, καὶ ἐν αὐτῷ ἔχει τὴν ἐλπίδα, καὶ οὐ
καταβοήσεται περὶ σοῦ πρὸς Κύριον, καὶ ἔσται ἐν σοὶ ἁμαρτία.
Οὐκ ἀποθανοῦνται πατέρες ὑπὲρ τέκνων, καὶ υἱοὶ οὐκ ἀποθανοῦνται 16
ὑπὲρ πατέρων· ἕκαστος ἐν τῇ ἑαυτοῦ ἁμαρτίᾳ ἀποθανεῖται. Οὐκ 17
ἐκκλινεῖς κρίσιν προσηλύτου καὶ ὀρφανοῦ καὶ χήρας, καὶ οὐκ ἐνε-
χυράσεις ἱμάτιον χήρας· καὶ μνησθήσῃ ὅτι οἰκέτης ἦσθα ἐν γῇ 18
Αἰγύπτῳ, καὶ ἐλυτρώσατό σε Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου ἐκεῖθεν· διὰ
τοῦτο ἐγὼ σοι ἐντέλλομαι ποιεῖν τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο. Ἐὰν ἀμήσῃς ἀ- 19
μητόν σου ἐν τῷ ἀγρῷ σου, καὶ ἐπιλάθῃ δράγμα ἐν τῷ ἀγρῷ σου,
οὐκ ἐπαναστραφήσῃ λαβεῖν αὐτό· τῷ πτωχῷ καὶ τῷ προσηλύτῳ
καὶ τῷ ὀρφανῷ καὶ τῇ χήρᾳ ἔσται, ἵνα εὐλογήσῃ σε Κύριος ὁ
Θεός σου ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς ἔργοις τῶν χειρῶν σου. Ἐὰν δὲ ἐλαιολογῇ- 20
σῃς, οὐκ ἐπαναστρέψεις καλαμήσασθαι τὰ ὀπίσω σου· τῷ προσηλύ-
τῳ καὶ τῷ ὀρφανῷ καὶ τῇ χήρᾳ ἔσται· καὶ μνησθήσῃ ὅτι οἰκέτης
ἦσθα ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ· διὰ τοῦτο ἐγὼ σοι ἐντέλλομαι ποιεῖν τὸ ῥῆ-
μα τοῦτο. Ἐὰν δὲ τρυγήσῃς τὸν ἀμπελῶνά σου, οὐκ ἐπανατρυγή- 21
σεις τὰ ὀπίσω σου· τῷ προσηλύτῳ καὶ τῷ ὀρφανῷ καὶ τῇ χήρᾳ
ἔσται· καὶ μνησθήσῃ ὅτι οἰκέτης ἦσθα ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ· διὰ τοῦ-
το ἐγώ σοι ἐντέλλομαι ποιεῖν τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο.

DEUTERONOMY, CHAPTER 24

9 Remember what the Lord thy God did unto Miriam on the way, when ye were come forth from Egypt.
10 If there be a debt with thy neighbor, [even] a debt, [be it] anything, thou shalt not enter into his house to take his pledge.
11 Thou shalt stand without, and the man to whom thy loan is [given], he shall bring forth unto thee the pledge without.
12 But if the man be poor, thou shalt not lie down with his pledge.
13 Thou shalt surely restore unto him his garment at the going down of the sun, that he may sleep in his own raiment; and he shall bless thee, and it shall be unto thee righteousness before the Lord thy God.
14 Thou shalt not defraud a poor and needy hireling, whether he be of thy brethren, or of the sojourners that are in thy land within thy cities.
15 On the same day shalt thou give him his hire; the sun shall not go down upon it, for he is poor, and therewith doth he set his hope: lest he cry out against thee unto the Lord, and it be sin in thee.
16 The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: but every man shall be put to death for his own sin.
17 Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the sojourner, nor of the orphan, nor of the widow, neither shalt thou take a widow's raiment to pledge.
18 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and the Lord thy God redeemed thee thence: therefore I command thee to do this thing.
19 When thou reapest thine harvest in thy field, and hast forgotten a sheaf in thy field, thou shalt not turn back to take it: it shall be for the poor, for the sojourner, for the orphan, and for the widow: that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all the work of thy hands.
20 When thou beatest thine olive trees, thou shalt not return to glean what is left behind thee: it shall be for the sojourner, for the orphan, and for the widow; and thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt: therefore I command thee to do this thing.
21 When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean again what is left behind thee: it shall be for the sojourner, for the orphan, and for the widow; and thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt: therefore I command thee to do this thing.
