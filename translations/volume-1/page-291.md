Α Ρ Ι Θ Μ Ο Ι ΚΕΦ. ΚΑ΄. ΚΒ

34 εἰς πόλεμον εἰς Ἐδραείν. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν· μὴ φοβηθῇς
    αὐτόν, ὅτι εἰς τὰς χεῖράς σου παραδέδωκα αὐτόν, καὶ πάν-
    τα τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ· καὶ ποιήσεις αὐ-
    τῷ, καθὼς ἐποίησας τῷ Σηὼν βασιλεῖ τῶν Ἀμοῤῥαίων, ὃς κατῴχει
    35 ἐν Ἑσεβών. Καὶ ἐπάταξαν αὐτόν, καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ, καὶ
    πάντα τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ, ἕως τοῦ μὴ καταλιπεῖν αὐτοῦ ζωγρεῖαν
    καὶ ἐκληρονόμησαν τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΒ΄. XXII.

1 ΚΑΙ ἀπάραντες οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ, παρενέβαλον ἐπὶ δυσμῶν Μωὰβ
    παρὰ τὸν Ἰορδάνην κατὰ Ἱεριχώ.
2 Καὶ ἰδὼν Βαλὰκ υἱὸς Σεπφὼρ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν Ἰσραὴλ τῷ Ἀμοῤῥαίῳ,
    καὶ ἐφοβήθη
3 Μωὰβ τὸν λαὸν σφόδρα, ὅτι πολλοὶ ἦσαν· καὶ προσώχθισε Μωὰβ
    ἀπὸ προσώπου υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ.
4 Καὶ εἶπε Μωὰβ τῇ γερουσίᾳ Μαδιὰμ· νῦν ἐκλείξει ἡ συναγωγὴ αὕτη
    πάντας τοὺς κύκλῳ ἡμῶν, ὡσεὶ ἐκλείζει ὁ μόσχος τὰ χλωρὰ ἐκ τοῦ
    πεδίου. Καὶ Βαλὰκ
5 υἱὸς Σεπφώρ, βασιλεὺς Μωὰβ ἦν κατὰ τὸν καιρὸν ἐκεῖνον. Καὶ
    ἀπέστειλε πρέσβεις πρὸς Βαλαὰμ υἱὸν Βεὼρ Βαθουρά, ὃς ἐστιν
    ἐπὶ τοῦ ποταμοῦ γῆς υἱῶν λαοῦ αὐτοῦ, καλέσαι αὐτόν, λέγων·
    Ἰδοὺ λαὸς ἐξελήλυθεν ἐξ Αἰγύπτου, καὶ ἰδοὺ κατεκάλυψε τὴν ὄψιν
    6 τῆς γῆς, καὶ οὗτος ἐγκάθηται ἐχόμενός μου. Καὶ νῦν δεῦρο
    κατάρασαί μοι τὸν λαὸν τοῦτον, ὅτι ἰσχυρότερός μου ἐστίν, ἐὰν
    περ δυνώμεθα πατάξαι ἐξ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐκβαλῶ αὐτοὺς ἐκ τῆς γῆς·
7 ὅτι οἶδα, ὅτι οὓς ἂν εὐλογῇς σύ, εὐλόγηνται, καὶ οὓς ἂν καταράσῃ
    σύ, κεκατήρανται.
8 Καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἡ γερουσία Μωὰβ καὶ ἡ γερουσία Μαδιὰμ, καὶ τὰ
    μαντεῖα ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτῶν· καὶ ἦλθον πρὸς Βαλαὰμ, καὶ εἶπαν
    αὐτῷ τὰ ῥήματα Βαλάκ. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτούς· καταλύσατε αὐτοῦ
    τὴν νύκτα, καὶ ἀποκριθήσομαι ὑμῖν πρᾶγμα, ἃ ἂν λαλήσῃ Κύριος
    9 πρὸς με. Καὶ κατέμειναν οἱ ἄρχοντες Μωὰβ παρὰ Βαλαάμ.
10 Καὶ ἦλθεν ὁ Θεὸς πρὸς Βαλαὰμ, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· τί οἱ ἄνθρωποι
    οὗτοι παρὰ σοί;
11 Καὶ εἶπε Βαλαὰμ πρὸς τὸν Θεόν· Βαλὰκ υἱὸς Σεπφὼρ βασιλεὺς Μωὰβ
    ἀπέστειλεν ἀγγέλους πρὸς με, λέγων· Ἰδοὺ λαὸς ἐξελήλυθεν ἐξ
    Αἰγύπτου, καὶ ἐκάλυψε τὴν ὄψιν τῆς γῆς, καὶ οὗτος ἐγκάθηται
    ἐχόμενός μου· καὶ νῦν δεῦρο ἄρασαί μοι αὐτόν, εἰ ἄρα δυνήτομαι

NUMBERS CHAPTER 21

34 unto battle, unto Edrei. And the Lord said unto Moses, Fear him not; for into thy hands have I delivered him, and all his people, and all his land; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon, the king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon.
35 And they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until they left none of him alive; and they inherited his land.

CHAPTER 22

1 And the children of Israel journeyed forth, and pitched their camp upon the plains of Moab, beside the Jordan, over against Jericho.
2 Now when Balak, the son of Zippor, beheld all that Israel had wrought unto the Amorite,
3 Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many; and Moab was grievously vexed because of the children of Israel.
4 And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this assembly lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licketh up the green herb of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.
5 And he sent messengers unto Balaam, the son of Beor of Bathura, who dwelleth by the river of the land of the sons of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, a people is come out of Egypt, and, behold, it hath covered the face of the earth, and this [people] dwelleth opposite me.
6 And now, come thou, curse for me this people; for they are stronger than I; if perhaps we may be able to smite a part of them, and I may drive them out of the land;
7 For I know that whomsoever thou blessest, they are blessed, and whomsoever thou cursest, they are cursed.
8 And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed, and the fees for divination were in their hands; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak. And he said unto them, Lodge ye here this night, and I will answer you a matter, whatsoever the Lord shall speak unto me.
9 And the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.
10 And God came unto Balaam, and said unto him, What men are these with thee?
11 And Balaam said unto God, Balak, the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent messengers unto me, saying, Behold, a people is come out of Egypt, and it hath covered the face of the earth, and this [people] dwelleth opposite me; and now come, curse for me him, if perchance I might be able [to prevail].
