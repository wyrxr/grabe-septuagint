αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· ἀκούσατε τοῦ ἐνυπνίου τούτου, οὗ ἐνυπνιάσθην. **Ἴδον** ἡμᾶς δεσμεύειν δράγματα ἐν μέσῳ τῷ πεδίῳ· καὶ 7
ἀνέστη τὸ ἐμὸν δράγμα, καὶ ὠρθώθη. Περιστραφέντα δὲ τὰ δράγ-
ματα ὑμῶν, προσεκύνησαν τὸ ἐμὸν δράγμα. Εἶπαν δὲ αὐτῷ οἱ ἀ- 8
δελφοὶ αὐτοῦ· μὴ βασιλεύων βασιλεύσεις ἐφ᾿ ἡμᾶς, ἢ κυριεύων κυ-
ριεύσεις ἡμῶν; καὶ προσέθεντο ἔτι μισεῖν αὐτὸν ἕνεκεν τῶν ἐνυπνίων
αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἕνεκεν τῶν ῥημάτων αὐτοῦ. **Εἶδε** δὲ ἐνύπνιον ἕτερον, καὶ 9
διηγήσατο αὐτὸ τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶ-
πεν· Ἰδοὺ ἐνυπνιάσθην ἐνύπνιον ἕτερον· ὥσπερ ὁ ἥλιος, καὶ
ἡ σελήνη, καὶ ἕνδεκα ἀστέρες προσεκύνουν με. Καὶ ἐπετίμησεν 10
αὐτῷ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· τί τὸ ἐνύπνιον τοῦτο, ὃ
ἐνυπνιάσθης; ἆρά γε ἐλθόντες ἐλευσόμεθα ἐγώ τε καὶ ἡ μήτηρ σου
καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοί σου, προσκυνῆσαί σοι ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν; Ἐζήλωσαν δὲ 11
αὐτὸν οἱ ἀδελφοί αὐτοῦ· ὁ δὲ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ διετήρησε τὸ ῥῆμα.
Ἐπορεύθησαν δὲ οἱ ἀδελφοί αὐτοῦ, βόσκειν τὰ πρόβατα τοῦ πα- 12
τρὸς αὐτῶν εἰς Συχέμ. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς Ἰωσήφ· οὐχ οἱ 13
ἀδελφοί σου ποιμαίνουσιν ἐν Συχέμ; δεῦρο, ἀποστείλω σε πρὸς
αὐτούς. Εἶπε δὲ αὐτῷ· Ἰδοὺ ἐγώ. Εἶπε δὲ αὐτῷ Ἰσραήλ· πο- 14
ρευθεὶς ἴδε, εἰ ὑγιαίνουσιν οἱ ἀδελφοί σου καὶ τὰ πρόβατα, καὶ
ἀπάγγειλόν μοι. Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν αὐτὸν ἐκ τῆς κοιλάδος τῆς Χε-
βρὼν καὶ ἦλθεν εἰς Συχέμ. Καὶ εὗρεν αὐτὸν ἄνθρωπος πλανώ- 15
μενον ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ· ἠρώτησε δὲ αὐτὸν ὁ ἄνθρωπος, λέγων· τί
ζητεῖς ; Ὁ δὲ εἶπε· τοὺς ἀδελφούς μου ζητῶ· ἀπάγγειλόν μοι, 16
ποῦ βόσκουσιν. Εἶπε δὲ αὐτῷ ὁ ἄνθρωπος· **ἀπῆραν** ἐντεῦθεν· 17
ἤκουσα γὰρ αὐτῶν λεγόντων· πορευθῶμεν εἰς Δωθαείμ. Καὶ ἐ-
πορεύθη Ἰωσὴφ κατόπισθε τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτοῦ, καὶ εὗρεν αὐτοὺς
εἰς Δωθαείμ. **Προεῖδον** δὲ αὐτὸν μακρόθεν, πρὸ τοῦ ἐγγίσαι αὐ- 18
τὸν πρὸς αὐτούς· καὶ ἐπονηρεύοντο τοῦ ἀποκτεῖναι αὐτόν. Εἶπαν 19
δὲ ἕκαστος πρὸς τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ· Ἰδοὺ ὁ ἐνυπνιαστὴς ἐκεῖνος
ἔρχεται. Νῦν οὖν δεῦτε, ἀποκτείνωμεν αὐτόν, καὶ ῥίψωμεν αὐτὸν 20
εἰς ἕνα τῶν λάκκων, καὶ ἐροῦμεν· θηρίον πονηρὸν κατέφαγεν αὐ-
τόν· καὶ ὀψόμεθα, τί ἔσται τὰ ἐνύπνια αὐτοῦ. Ἀκούσας δὲ Ῥου- 21
βὴν, ἐξείλατο αὐτὸν ἐκ τῶν χειρῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ εἶπεν· οὐ πατά-
ξημεν αὐτὸν εἰς ψυχήν. Εἶπε δὲ αὐτοῖς Ῥουβήν· μὴ **ἐγχέετε** 22
αἷμα· ἐμβάλετε δὲ αὐτὸν εἰς ἕνα τῶν λάκκων τῶν ἐν τῇ ἐρή-
μῳ, χεῖρα δὲ μὴ ἐπενέγκητε αὐτῷ· ὅπως ἐξέλῃται αὐτὸν ἐκ τῶν

**Justification for OCR Corrections:**
1.  **Verse 7: Ἴδην → Ἴδον**: The form "Ἴδην" is ungrammatical as a first person aorist indicative ("I saw") in this narrative context. "Ἴδον" is the correct and expected form (from ὁράω), matching the Moscow/Grabe Septuagint.
2.  **Verse 9: Ἴδε → Εἶδε**: "Ἴδε" is an imperative ("See!"), while the narrative requires a third person aorist indicative ("he saw"). "Εἶδε" (from ὁράω) is the grammatically correct and expected form, matching the Moscow/Grabe Septuagint.
3.  **Verse 17: ἀπῆρκασιν → ἀπῆραν**: "ἀπῆρκασιν" (perfect of ἀπάρχω, "to offer first fruits") makes no sense in the context of "they departed from here". "ἀπῆραν" (aorist of ἀπαίρω, "to depart") is the grammatically and textually appropriate word, matching the Moscow/Grabe Septuagint.
4.  **Verse 18: Προΐδον → Προεῖδον**: "Προΐδον" is not a recognized form for "they saw beforehand" in Attic or Koine Greek. "Προεῖδον" (aorist of προοράω) is the grammatically correct third person plural aorist indicative, matching the Moscow/Grabe Septuagint.
5.  **Verse 22: ἐχέγετε → ἐγχέετε**: "ἐχέγετε" is not a standard Greek verb form. The context "Shed no blood" requires a form of "to pour out" or "to shed." "ἐγχέετε" (imperative plural of ἐκχέω or a variant), meaning "do not shed/pour out," is the grammatically correct and expected form, matching the Moscow/Grabe Septuagint.

**Genesis, Chapter 37**

⁶ and he said unto them, Hearken, I pray you, to this dream, which I have dreamed: ⁷ For behold, we were binding sheaves in the midst of the field; and lo, my sheaf arose, and stood upright. And your sheaves, having encircled it, bowed down to my sheaf. ⁸ Then said his brethren unto him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? Or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.

⁹ And he saw yet another dream, and told it unto his father and unto his brethren, saying, Behold, I have dreamed yet another dream; and lo, the sun, and the moon, and the eleven stars bowed down to me. ¹⁰ And his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down unto thee upon the earth? ¹¹ And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.

¹² And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem. ¹³ And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? Come now, I will send thee unto them. And he said unto him, Here am I. ¹⁴ And Israel said unto him, Go, I pray thee, see if it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flock; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.

¹⁵ And a man found him, and lo, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou? ¹⁶ And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks. ¹⁷ And the man said unto him, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go unto Dothaim. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothaim.

¹⁸ Now when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him. ¹⁹ And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh. ²⁰ Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say, An evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what shall become of his dreams. ²¹ But Reuben heard this, and he delivered him out of their hands; and he said, Let us not smite him to the death. ²² And Reuben said unto them, Shed ye no blood, but cast him into one of these pits which are in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might deliver him out of their [hands].
