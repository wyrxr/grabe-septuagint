ΚΕΦ. ΚΖ´. ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ 45´

2.  ἐγώ. Καὶ εἶπεν· ἰδοὺ γεγήρακα, καὶ οὐ γινώσκω τὴν ἡμέραν τῆς
3.  τελευτῆς μου. Νῦν οὖν λάβε τὸ σκεῦός σου, τήν τε φαρέτραν, καὶ
4.  τὸ τόξον, καὶ ἔξελθε εἰς τὸ πεδίον, καὶ θηρεύσον μοι θήραν· καὶ
    ποίησόν μοι ἐδέσματα, ὡς φιλῶ ἐγώ· καὶ ἐνεγκόν μοι ἵνα φάγω,
5.  ὅπως εὐλογήσῃ σε ἡ ψυχή μου, πρὸ τοῦ ἀποθανεῖν με. Ῥεβέκ-
    κα δὲ ἤκουσε λαλοῦντος Ἰσαὰκ πρὸς Ἠσαῦ τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ· ἐπο-
    ρεύθη δὲ Ἠσαῦ εἰς τὸ πεδίον, θηρεῦσαι θήραν τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ.
6.  Ῥεβέκχα δὲ εἶπε πρὸς Ἰακὼβ τὸν υἱὸν αὐτῆς τὸν ἐλάσσω· ἴδε,
7.  ἐγὼ ἤκουσα τοῦ πατρός σου λαλοῦντος πρὸς Ἠσαῦ τὸν ἀδελφόν
    σου, λέγοντος· ἔνεγκόν μοι θήραν, καὶ ποίησόν μοι ἐδέσματα, ἵνα
8.  φάγω εὐλογήσῃ σε ἐναντίον Κυρίου, πρὸ τοῦ ἀποθανεῖν με. Νῦν
9.  οὖν υἱέ μου ἄκουσόν μου, καθὰ ἐγὼ ἐντέλλομαί σοι· καὶ πορευ-
    θεὶς εἰς τὰ πρόβατα, λάβε μοι ἐκεῖθεν δύο ἐρίφους ἁπαλοὺς καὶ
10. καλοὺς, καὶ ποιήσω αὐτοὺς ἐδέσματα τῷ πατρί σου, ὡς φιλεῖ·
    καὶ εἰσοίσεις τῷ πατρί σου, καὶ φάγεται, ὅπως εὐλογήσῃ σε ὁ
11. πατήρ σου, πρὸ τοῦ ἀποθανεῖν αὐτόν. Εἶπε δὲ Ἰακὼβ πρὸς Ῥε-
    βέκκαν τὴν μητέρα αὐτοῦ· ἔστιν Ἠσαῦ ὁ ἀδελφός μου ἀνὴρ δα-
12. σύς, ἐγὼ δὲ ἀνὴρ λείος· μήποτε ψηλαφήσῃ με ὁ πατήρ μου, καὶ
    ἔσομαι ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ ὡς καταφρονῶν, καὶ ἐπάξω ἐπ᾿ ἐμαυτὸν
13. κατάραν, καὶ οὐκ εὐλογίαν. Εἶπε δὲ αὐτῷ ἡ μήτηρ· ἐπ᾿ ἐμὲ ἡ
    κατάρα σου, τέκνον· μόνον ὑπάκουσον τῆς φωνῆς μου, καὶ πορευ-
14. θεὶς ἔνεγκέ μοι. Πορευθεὶς δὲ ἔλαβε, καὶ ἤνεγκε τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ
    καὶ ἐποίησεν ἡ μήτηρ αὐτοῦ ἐδέσματα, καθὰ ἐφίλει ὁ πατὴρ αὐ-
15. τοῦ. Καὶ λαβοῦσα Ῥεβέκκα τὴν στολὴν Ἠσαῦ τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτῆς τοῦ
    πρεσβυτέρου τὴν καλήν, ἣ ἦν παρ᾿ αὐτῇ ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ, καὶ ἐνέδυσεν
16. Ἰακὼβ τὸν υἱὸν αὐτῆς τὸν νεώτερον· καὶ τὰ δέρματα τῶν ἐρίφων
    περιέθηκεν ἐπὶ τοὺς βραχίονας αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ γυμνὰ τοῦ τρα-
17. χήλου αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἔδωκε τὰ ἐδέσματα καὶ τοὺς ἄρτους οὓς ἐποίη-
    σεν, εἰς τὰς χεῖρας Ἰακὼβ τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτῆς.
18. Καὶ εἰσήνεγκε τῷ
    πατρὶ αὐτοῦ, εἶπε δέ· πάτερ μου. Ὁ δὲ εἶπεν· ἰδοὺ ἐγώ· τίς εἶ
19. σύ, τέκνον; Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰακὼβ (ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ) τῷ πατρί αὐτοῦ·
    ἐγὼ Ἠσαῦ ὁ πρωτότοκός σου, ἐποίησα καθὰ ἐλάλησάς μοι· ἀνα-
20. στὰς κάθισον, καὶ φάγε ἀπὸ τῆς θήρας μου, ὅπως εὐλογήσῃ με ἡ
    ψυχή σου. Εἶπε δὲ Ἰσαὰκ τῷ υἱῷ αὐτοῦ· τί τοῦτο, ὃ ταχὺ εὗ-
21. ρες ὦ τέκνον; Ὁ δὲ εἶπεν· ὅτι παρέδωκε Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου
    ἐναντίον μου. Εἶπε δὲ Ἰσαὰκ τῷ Ἰακώβ· ἔγγισόν μοι, καὶ ψηλαφήσω

**CHAPTER XXVII. GENESIS**

2.  And he said, "Behold, I am grown old, and I know not the day of my demise.
3.  Now therefore, take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow,
4.  and go forth to the field, and hunt me venison; and prepare me savory meats, such as I love: and bring [them] unto me, that I may eat,
5.  that my soul may bless thee ere I die." And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake unto Esau his son; and Esau went forth to the field to hunt venison for his father.
6.  Then Rebekah said unto Jacob her younger son, "Behold,
7.  I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying, 'Bring me venison, and make me savory meats, that
8.  I may eat, [and so] bless thee before the Lord, ere I die.' Now therefore, my son, hearken unto my voice, in that which I command thee.
9.  Go now to the flock, and fetch me thence two good and tender kids [of the goats],
10. and I will make them savory meats for thy father, such as he loveth. And thou shalt bring [them] to thy father, that he may eat thereof, and that thy father may bless thee before he die."
11. And Jacob said unto Rebekah his mother, "Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, but I am a smooth man:
12. lest peradventure my father feel me, and I shall seem unto him as a deceiver, and bring a curse upon myself, and not a blessing."
13. And his mother said unto him, "Upon me be thy curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go, fetch [them] for me."
14. And he went, and fetched, and brought [them] to his mother: and his mother made savory meats, such as his father loved.
15. And Rebekah took goodly raiment of Esau her elder son, which was with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:
16. and she put the skins of the kids [of the goats] upon his arms, and upon the smooth of his neck;
17. and she gave the savory meats and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hands of her son Jacob.
18. And he came unto his father, and said, "My father." And he said, "Here am I; who art thou, my son?"
19. And Jacob (his son) said unto his father, "I am Esau thy firstborn; I have done according as thou badest me. Arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me."
20. And Isaac said unto his son, "How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son?" And he said, "Because the Lord thy God did bring it unto me."
21. And Isaac said unto Jacob, "Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel [thee]."
