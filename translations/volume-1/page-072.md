στήλη αὕτη, ἣν ἔστησα ἀνὰ μέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ σοῦ· μαρτυρεῖ ὁ
βουνὸς οὗτος, καὶ μαρτυρεῖ ἡ στήλη αὕτη.) Διὰ τοῦτο ἐκλήθη 49
τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ, Βουνὸς μαρτυρεῖ, καὶ ἡ ὅρασις, ἣν εἶπεν ἐπί- 50
σοι· ὁ Θεὸς ἀνὰ μέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ σοῦ, ὅτι ἀποστησόμεθα ἕτερος
ἀπὸ τοῦ ἑτέρου. Εἰ ταπεινώσεις τὰς θυγατέρας μου, εἰ λήψῃ γυ- 51
ναῖκας ἐπὶ ταῖς θυγατράσι· μου, ὅρα, οὐδεὶς μεθ’ ἡμῶν ἐστιν·
Θεὸς μάρτυς μεταξὺ ἐμοῦ καὶ μεταξὺ σοῦ. Καὶ εἶπε Λάβαν τῷ 52
Ἰακώβ· ἰδοὺ ὁ βουνὸς οὗτος καὶ ἡ στήλη ἣν ἔστησα ἀνὰ μέσον ἐμοῦ
καὶ σοῦ· μαρτυρεῖ ὁ βουνὸς οὗτος, καὶ ἡ στήλη, ἣν ἔστησα, αὕτη 53
μαρτυρεῖ, ἐάν τε γὰρ ἐγὼ μὴ διαβῶ πρὸς σέ, μηδὲ σὺ διαβῇς
πρὸς μέ τὸν βουνὸν τοῦτον καὶ τὴν στήλην ταύτην ἐπὶ κακίᾳ. Ὁ 54
Θεὸς Ἀβραὰμ καὶ ὁ Θεὸς Ναχὼρ κρινεῖ ἀνὰ μέσον ἡμῶν. Καὶ 55
ὤμοσεν Ἰακὼβ κατὰ τοῦ φόβου τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ Ἰσαάκ, καὶ
ἔθυσεν Ἰακὼβ θυσίαν ἐν τῷ ὄρει, καὶ ἐκάλεσε τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐ-
τοῦ τοῦ φαγεῖν τὸν ἄρτον· καὶ ἔφαγον ἄρτον, καὶ ἔπιον, καὶ ἐκοι-
μήθησαν ἐν τῷ ὄρει. Ἀναστὰς δὲ Λάβαν τὸ πρωΐ, κατεφίλησε τοὺς 56
υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας αὐτοῦ, καὶ εὐλόγησεν αὐτοὺς· καὶ
ἀποστραφεὶς Λάβαν, ἀπῆλθεν εἰς τὸν τόπον αὐτοῦ.

ΚΑΙ Ἰακὼβ ἀπῆλθεν εἰς τὴν ἑαυτοῦ ὁδόν· καὶ ἀναβλέψας 1
τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς εἶδε παρεμβολὴν Θεοῦ παρεμβεβληκυῖαν· καὶ συνήν-
τησαν αὐτῷ οἱ ἄγγελοι τοῦ Θεοῦ. Εἶπε δὲ Ἰακώβ, ἡνίκα εἶδεν 2
αὐτούς· παρεμβολὴ Θεοῦ αὕτη· καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ τόπου
ἐκείνου, Παρεμβολαί. Ἀπέστειλε δὲ Ἰακὼβ ἀγγέλους ἔμπροσθεν 3
αὐτοῦ πρὸς Ἠσαῦ τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ εἰς γῆν Σηείρ, εἰς χώραν
Ἐδώμ. Καὶ ἐνετείλατο αὐτοῖς, λέγων· οὕτως ἐρεῖτε τῷ κυρίῳ 4
μου Ἠσαῦ· οὕτω λέγει ὁ παῖς σου Ἰακώβ· μετὰ Λάβαν παρῴ-
κησα, καὶ ἐχρόνησα ἕως τοῦ νῦν· καὶ ἐγένοντό μοι βόες, καὶ ὄνοι, 5
καὶ πρόβατα, καὶ παῖδες, καὶ παιδίσκαι· καὶ ἀπέστειλα ἀναγγεῖ-
λαι τῷ κυρίῳ μου Ἠσαῦ, ἵνα εὕρῃ ὁ παῖς σου χάριν ἐναντίον σου.
Καὶ ἀνέστρεψαν οἱ ἄγγελοι πρὸς Ἰακώβ, λέγοντες· ἤλθομεν πρὸς 6
τὸν ἀδελφόν σου Ἠσαῦ· καὶ ἔρχεται εἰς συνάντησίν σοι, καὶ τε-
τρακόσιοι ἄνδρες μετ’ αὐτοῦ. Ἐφοβεῖτο δὲ Ἰακὼβ σφόδρα, καὶ 7
ἠπορεῖτο· καὶ διεῖλε τὸν λαὸν τὸν μεθ’ αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοὺς βόας, καὶ

### CHAPTER 31

49 (This pillar which I have set up between me and thee; this mound doth bear witness, and this pillar doth bear witness.) Therefore was its name called, "Mound of Witness,"
50 and the utterance, which he spoke concerning thee: "God [is] between me and thee, for we shall separate, one from the other.
51 If thou shalt humble my daughters, or if thou shalt take wives in addition to my daughters, behold, no man is with us; God [is] witness betwixt me and betwixt thee."
52 And Laban said unto Jacob, "Behold, this mound and this pillar which I have set up between me and thee!
53 This mound doth bear witness, and this pillar which I have set up, it doth bear witness, that neither shall I pass over unto thee, nor shalt thou pass over unto me, this mound and this pillar, for evil intent.
54 The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor shall judge between us."
55 And Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac. And Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his brethren to eat the bread. And they ate bread, and they drank, and they lodged in the mountain.
56 And Laban rose up in the morning, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them; and Laban departed, and returned unto his own place.

### CHAPTER 32

1 And Jacob went on his way; and he lifted up his eyes, and saw a camp of God encamped; and the angels of God met him.
2 And Jacob said, when he saw them, "This is the camp of God!" And he called the name of that place, Camps.
3 And Jacob sent messengers before him unto Esau his brother, into the land of Seir, into the country of Edom.
4 And he commanded them, saying, "Thus shall ye say unto my lord Esau: Thus saith thy servant Jacob,
5 'With Laban have I sojourned, and tarried [there] until now; and I have acquired oxen, and asses, and flocks, and menservants, and maidservants;
6 and I have sent to declare [this] unto my lord Esau, that thy servant may find grace in thy sight.'" And the messengers returned unto Jacob, saying, "We came unto thy brother Esau; and, behold, he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him."
7 And Jacob was greatly afraid, and was in great distress; and he divided the people that were with him, and the oxen, and
