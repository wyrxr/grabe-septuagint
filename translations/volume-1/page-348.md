ΚΕΦ. ΙΒ΄. ΔΕΥΤΕΡΟΝΟΜΙΟΝ 333
ρες ὑμῶν, καὶ οἱ παῖδες ὑμῶν καὶ αἱ παιδίσκαι ὑμῶν, καὶ ὁ Λευίτης ὁ ἐπὶ τῶν πυλῶν ὑμῶν· ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν αὐτῷ μερὶς οὐδὲ κλῆρος μεθ᾽ ὑμῶν.
13. Πρόσεχε σεαυτῷ, μή ποτε ἀνενέγκῃς τὰ ὁλοκαυτώματά σου ἐν παντὶ τόπῳ οὗ ἐὰν ἴδῃς,
14. ἀλλ᾽ ἢ εἰς τὸν τόπον, ὃν ἂν ἐκλέξηται Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου αὐτόν, ἐν μιᾷ τῶν φυλῶν σου, ἐκεῖ ἀνοίσεις τὰ ὁλοκαυτώματά σου, καὶ ἐκεῖ ποιήσεις πάντα ὅσα ἐγὼ ἐντέλλομαί σοι σήμερον.
15. Ἀλλ᾽ ἢ ἐν πάσῃ ἐπιθυμίᾳ ψυχῆς σου θύσεις, καὶ φαγῇ κρέα κατὰ τὴν εὐλογίαν Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ σου, ἣν ἔδωκέ σοι ἐν πάσῃ πόλει σου· ὁ ἀκάθαρτος ἐν σοὶ καὶ ὁ καθαρὸς ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ φάγεται αὐτό, ὡς δορκάδα ἢ ἔλαφον.
16. Πλὴν τὸ αἷμα οὐ φάγεσθε· ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ἐκχεεῖτε αὐτὸ ὡς ὕδωρ.
17. Οὐ δυνήσῃ φαγεῖν ἐν ταῖς πόλεσί σου τὸ ἐπιδέκατον τοῦ σίτου σου καὶ τοῦ οἴνου σου καὶ τοῦ ἐλαίου σου, τὰ πρωτότοκα τῶν βοῶν σου καὶ τῶν προβάτων σου, καὶ πάσας εὐχάς σου, ὅσας ἂν εὔξησθε, καὶ
18. τὰς ὁμολογίας ὑμῶν, καὶ τὰς ἀπαρχὰς τῶν χειρῶν ὑμῶν· ἀλλ᾽ ἢ ἔναντι Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ σου φαγῇ αὐτὰ ἐν τῷ τόπῳ οὗ ἂν ἐκλέξηται Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου αὐτό, σὺ καὶ ὁ υἱός σου καὶ ἡ θυγάτηρ σου, ὁ παῖς σου καὶ ἡ παιδίσκη σου, καὶ ὁ Λευίτης, καὶ ὁ προσήλυτος ὁ ἐν ταῖς πόλεσί σου· καὶ εὐφρανθήσῃ ἔναντι Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ σου ἐπὶ πάντα, οὗ ἐὰν ἐπιβάλῃς τὴν χεῖρά σου.
19. Πρόσεχε σεαυτῷ μή ποτε ἐγκαταλίπῃς τὸν Λευίτην, ὅσον ἂν χρόνον ζῇς ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς.
20. Ἐὰν δὲ ἐμπλατύνῃ Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου τὰ ὅριά σου, καθάπερ ἐλάλησέ σοι, καὶ εἴπῃς, φάγομαι κρέα, ἐὰν ἐπιθυμήσῃ ἡ ψυχή σου, ὥστε φαγεῖν κρέα, ἐὰν πάσῃ ἐπιθυμίᾳ τῆς ψυχῆς σου φαγῇ κρέα.
21. Ἐὰν δὲ μακρότερον ἀπέχῃ σου ὁ τόπος, ὃν ἂν ἐκλέξηται Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου, ἐπικληθῆναι τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ ἐκεῖ, καὶ θύσεις ἀπὸ τῶν βοῶν σου καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν προβάτων σου, ὡς ἂν δῷ σοι ὁ Θεός σου, ὃν τρόπον ἐνετειλάμην σοι, καὶ φαγῇ ἐν ταῖς πόλεσί σου κατὰ πᾶσαν τὴν ἐπιθυμίαν τῆς ψυχῆς σου·
22. ὡς ἔσθεται ἡ δορκὰς καὶ ἡ ἔλαφος, οὕτως φαγῇ αὐτό· ὁ ἀκάθαρτος ἐν σοὶ καὶ ὁ καθαρὸς ὡσαύτως ἔδεται αὐτό.
23. Πρόσεχε ἰσχυρῶς τοῦ μὴ φαγεῖν αἷμα· τὸ γὰρ αἷμα αὐτοῦ ψυχή· οὐ βρωθήσεται ψυχὴ μετὰ τῶν κρεῶν·
24. οὐ φάγεσθε αὐτό, ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ἐκχεεῖτε αὐτὸ ὡς ὕδωρ·
25. οὐ φαγῇ αὐτό, ἵνα εὖ σοι γένηται καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς σου μετὰ σέ (εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα), ἐὰν ποιήσῃς τὸ καλὸν καὶ τὸ ἀρεστὸν ἔναντι Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ σου.
26. Πλὴν τὰ ἅγιά σου ἃ ἂν σοι γένηται, καὶ τὰς εὐχάς σου λαβὼν ἥξεις εἰς

#### Poetic, Literary Translation

12. [The final letters of a word, likely 'daughters'] of yours, and your male servants and your female servants, and the Levite who is at your gates; for there is not unto him a portion nor an inheritance with you.
13. Take heed to thyself, lest thou offer thy burnt offerings in every place where thou shalt see,
14. But only in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose, [even] in one of thy tribes, there shalt thou offer thy burnt offerings, and there shalt thou do all things whatsoever I command thee this day.
15. Howbeit, in all the desire of thy soul thou mayest sacrifice and eat flesh according to the blessing of the Lord thy God, which He hath given thee in every city of thine; the unclean among you and the clean shall eat thereof together, as [one eats] a gazelle or a deer.
16. Only the blood shall ye not eat; upon the earth shall ye pour it out as water.
17. Thou shalt not be able to eat within thy cities the tithe of thy grain and of thy wine and of thine oil, nor the firstborn of thy oxen and of thy sheep, nor all thy vows, whatsoever ye shall vow,
18. Nor your pledges, nor the firstfruits of your hands; but only before the Lord thy God shalt thou eat them in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose, thou and thy son and thy daughter, thy male servant and thy female servant, and the Levite, and the sojourner who is within thy cities; and thou shalt rejoice before the Lord thy God in all things, whereon thou shalt lay thy hand.
19. Take heed to thyself lest thou forsake the Levite, all the time that thou livest upon the earth.
20. If the Lord thy God shall enlarge thy borders, as He hath spoken unto thee, and thou shalt say, "I will eat flesh," because thy soul desireth to eat flesh, if with every desire of thy soul thou eatest flesh:
21. But if the place which the Lord thy God shall choose, for His Name to be called upon there, be further from thee, then shalt thou sacrifice of thy oxen and of thy sheep, as the Lord thy God shall give unto thee, in such manner as I have commanded thee; and thou shalt eat within thy cities according to all the desire of thy soul.
22. As the gazelle and the deer are eaten, so shalt thou eat of it; the unclean among you and the clean shall likewise eat of it.
23. Take heed strongly not to eat blood; for the blood thereof is the life; the life shall not be eaten with the flesh;
24. Ye shall not eat it; upon the earth shall ye pour it out as water;
25. Thou shalt not eat it, that it may be well with thee and with thy sons after thee (for ever), when thou shalt do that which is good and pleasing before the Lord thy God.
26. Nevertheless, thy holy things which shall be unto thee, and thy vows, thou shalt take and come unto
