13 **ἅψεται** αὐτοῦ χείρ· ἐν γὰρ λίθοις λιθοβοληθήσεται, ἢ βολίδι κατατοξευθήσεται· ἐάν τε κτῆνος, ἐάν τε ἄνθρωπος, οὐ ζήσεται. Ὅταν αἱ φωναὶ καὶ αἱ σάλπιγγες καὶ ἡ νεφέλη ἀπέλθῃ ἀπὸ τοῦ ὄρους,
14 ἐκεῖνοι ἀναβήσονται ἐπὶ τὸ ὄρος. Κατέβη δὲ Μωυσῆς ἀπὸ τοῦ ὄρους πρὸς τὸν λαόν, καὶ ἡγίασεν αὐτούς· καὶ ἔπλυναν τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτῶν.
15 Καὶ εἶπε τῷ λαῷ· γίνεσθε ἕτοιμοι τρεῖς ἡμέρας, μὴ προσέλθητε γυναικί.
16 Ἐγένετο δὲ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τρίτῃ, γενηθέντος πρὸς ὄρθρον, καὶ ἐγίνοντο φωναὶ καὶ ἀστραπαὶ καὶ νεφέλη γνοφώδης ἐπ᾿ ὄρους Σινά, φωνὴ τῆς σάλπιγγος ἠχεῖ μέγα· καὶ ἐπτοήθη πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ὁ ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ.
17 Καὶ ἐξήγαγε Μωυσῆς τὸν λαὸν εἰς τὴν συνάντησιν τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐκ τῆς παρεμβολῆς, καὶ παρέστησαν ὑπὸ τὸ ὄρος.
18 Τὸ δὲ ὄρος Σινὰ ἐκαπνίζετο ὅλον αὐτό, διὰ τὸ καταβεβηκέναι τὸν Θεὸν ἐν πυρὶ ἐπ᾿ αὐτό· ἀνέβαινε δὲ ὁ καπνός, ὡς ἀτμὶς καμίνου· καὶ ἐξέστη πᾶς ὁ λαὸς σφόδρα.
19 Ἐγίνοντο δὲ αἱ φωναὶ τῆς σάλπιγγος προβαίνουσαι, ἰσχυρότεραι σφόδρα· Μωυσῆς ἐλάλει, ὁ δὲ Θεὸς ἀπεκρίνατο αὐτῷ φωνῇ.
20 Κατέβη δὲ Κύριος ἐπὶ τὸ ὄρος Σινὰ ἐπὶ τὴν κορυφὴν τοῦ ὄρους· καὶ ἐκάλεσε Κύριος Μωυσῆν ἐπὶ τὴν κορυφὴν τοῦ ὄρους, καὶ ἀνέβη Μωυσῆς.
21 Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ Θεὸς πρὸς Μωυσῆν, λέγων καταβὰς διαμάρτυραι τῷ λαῷ, μήποτε ἐγγίσωσι πρὸς τὸν Θεὸν κατανοῆσαι, καὶ πέσῃ ἐξ αὐτῶν πλῆθος·
22 καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς δὲ οἱ ἐγγίζοντες Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ, ἁγιασθήτωσαν, μή ποτε ἀπαλλάξῃ ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν Κύριος.
23 Καὶ εἶπε Μωυσῆς πρὸς τὸν Θεόν· οὐ δυνήσεται ὁ λαὸς προσαναβῆναι πρὸς τὸ ὄρος τὸ Σινά· σὺ γὰρ διαμεμαρτύρησαι ἡμῖν, λέγων ἀφόρισαι τὸ ὄρος, καὶ ἁγίασαι αὐτό.
24 Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Κύριος· βάδιζε, κατάβηθι, καὶ ἀνάβηθι σύ, καὶ Ἀαρὼν μετὰ σοῦ· οἱ δὲ ἱερεῖς καὶ ὁ λαὸς μὴ βιαζέσθωσαν ἀναβῆναι πρὸς τὸν Θεόν, μή ποτε ἀπολέσῃ ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν Κύριος.
25 Κατέβη δὲ Μωυσῆς πρὸς τὸν λαόν, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν πάντας τοὺς λόγους τούτους, λέγων·
2 Ἐγώ εἰμι Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου, ὁ ἐξαγαγών σε ἐκ
3 γῆς Αἰγύπτου, ἐξ οἴκου δουλείας. Οὐκ ἔσονται σοι θεοὶ ἕτεροι
4 πλὴν ἐμοῦ. Οὐ ποιήσεις σεαυτῷ εἴδωλον, οὐδὲ παντὸς ὁμοίωμα, ὅσα

*Correction Note:* The original text began with `ται αὐτοῦ χείρ`. As `ται` is an ungrammatical fragment in this context and would render the verse unintelligible, it has been corrected to `ἅψεται` to complete the phrase `οὐχ ἅψεται αὐτοῦ χείρ` (implied from the previous context and consistent with Exodus 19:13 in the Septuagint), thus making the sentence grammatically correct and textually probable.

### Exodus Chapter 19

13 ...[no hand] shall touch his hand; for with stones shall he be stoned, or with a dart shall he be shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live. When the voices and the trumpets and the cloud depart from the mountain, then shall they go up onto the mountain.
14 And Moses went down from the mountain unto the people, and he sanctified them; and they washed their garments.
15 And he said unto the people, "Be ye ready for three days: come not near unto a woman."
16 And it came to pass on the third day, when it was toward morning, that there were voices and lightnings and a dark cloud upon Mount Sinai, and the voice of the trumpet did sound exceeding loud; and all the people that were in the camp were greatly terrified.
17 And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the foot of the mountain.
18 And Mount Sinai was altogether smoking, because the Lord had descended upon it in fire; and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace; and all the people were exceedingly terrified.
19 And the voices of the trumpet did sound, proceeding forth, mightier exceedingly; Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.
20 And the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai, upon the very top of the mountain; and the Lord called Moses up to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.
21 And God said unto Moses, saying, "Go down, testify solemnly unto the people, lest they draw near unto God to gaze upon [Him], and a multitude of them fall.
22 And let the priests also, which draw near unto the Lord God, be sanctified, lest the Lord burst forth upon them."
23 And Moses said unto God, "The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai; for Thou hast testified solemnly unto us, saying, 'Set apart the mountain, and sanctify it.'"
24 And the Lord said unto him, "Go, get thee down, and come up, thou, and Aaron with thee; but let not the priests and the people force themselves to come up unto God, lest the Lord destroy them."
25 So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.

### Exodus Chapter 20

1 And the Lord spake unto Moses all these words, saying,
2 "I am the Lord thy God, who have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
3 Thou shalt have no other gods beside Me.
4 Thou shalt not make unto thyself any graven image, nor any likeness [of whatsoever is] in the heaven above, or in the earth beneath, or in the waters under the earth.
