ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο μετὰ τὴν τελευτὴν Ἰησοῦ, καὶ ἐπηρώτων οἱ 1
υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐν Κυρίῳ, λέγοντες· τίς ἀναβήσεται ἡμῖν πρὸς τὸν Χανα-
ναῖον ἀρχηγούμενος, τοῦ πολεμῆσαι ἐν αὐτῷ; Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος· Ἰούδας 2
ἀναβήσεται· ἰδοὺ δέδωκα τὴν γῆν ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰού- 3
δας πρὸς Συμεὼν τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὑτοῦ· Ἀνάβηθι μετ’ ἐμοῦ ἐν τῷ
κλήρῳ μου, καὶ πολεμήσωμεν ἐν τῷ Χαναναίῳ, καὶ πορεύσομαι
καίγε ἐγὼ μετὰ σοῦ ἐν τῷ κλήρῳ σου· καὶ ἐπορεύθη μετ’ αὑτοῦ
Συμεών. Καὶ ἀνέβη Ἰούδας· καὶ ἔδωκε Κύριος τὸν Χαναναῖον 4
καὶ τὸν Φερεζαῖον ἐν χειρὶ αὑτοῦ, καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτοὺς ἐν Βεζὲκ
δέκα χιλιάδας ἀνδρῶν. Καὶ εὗρον τὸν Ἀδωνιβεζὲκ ἐν τῇ Βεζὲκ, 5
καὶ ἐπολέμησαν ἐν αὐτῷ· καὶ ἐπάταξαν τὸν Χαναναῖον καὶ τὸν
Φερεζαῖον. Καὶ ἔφυγεν Ἀδωνιβεζὲκ· καὶ κατεδραμον ὀπίσω αὑτοῦ, 6
καὶ ἔλαβον αὑτὸν, καὶ ἀπέκοψαν τὰ ἄκρα τῶν χειρῶν αὑτοῦ, καὶ
τὰ ἄκρα τῶν ποδῶν αὑτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἀδωνιβεζὲκ· Ἑβδομήκοντα 7
βασιλεῖς τὰ ἄκρα τῶν χειρῶν αὑτῶν καὶ τὰ ἄκρα τῶν ποδῶν
αὑτῶν ἀποκεκομμένοι, ἦσαν συλλέγοντες τὰ ὑποκάτω τῆς τραπέ-
ζης μου· καθὼς οὖν ἐποίησα, οὕτως ἀνταπέδωκέ μοι ὁ Θεός. Καὶ
ἤγαγον αὑτὸν εἰς Ἱερουσαλὴμ, καὶ ἀπέθανεν ἐκεῖ. Καὶ ἐπολέμησαν 8
οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰούδα ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ, καὶ κατελάβοντο αὑτὴν, καὶ ἐπά-
ταξαν αὑτὴν ἐν στόματι μαχαίρας, καὶ τὴν πόλιν ἐνέπρησαν ἐν
πυρί. Καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα κατέβησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰούδα τοῦ πολεμῆσαι 9
πρὸς τὸν Χαναναῖον, τὸν κατοικοῦντα τὴν ὀρεινὴν καὶ τὸν νότον
καὶ τὴν πεδινήν. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη Ἰούδας πρὸς τὸν Χαναναῖον τὸν 10
κατοικοῦντα ἐξ ἐναντίας· τὸ δὲ ὄνομα Χεβρὼν ἦν ἔμπροσθεν Κα-
ριαθαρβόχ (Σέφερ)· καὶ ἐπάταξε τὸν Σεσσὶ, καὶ τὸν Ἀχιμὰν, καὶ
τὸν Θολαμεὶ, γεννήματα τοῦ Ἐνάκ. Καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν ἐκεῖθεν πρὸς 11

**JUDGES**
**CHAPTER 1.**

**1.** And it came to pass after the death of Joshua,
that the children of Israel asked of the LORD, saying:
"Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites,
to lead us, that we may make war with them?"
**2.** And the LORD said, "Judah shall go up:
behold, I have delivered the land into his hand."
**3.** And Judah said unto Simeon his brother,
"Come up with me into my lot,
and let us fight against the Canaanites;
and I also will go with thee into thy lot."
And Simeon went with him.
**4.** And Judah went up;
and the LORD delivered the Canaanites
and the Perizzites into his hand:
and he smote them in Bezek,
even ten thousand men.
**5.** And they found Adonibezek in Bezek;
and they fought against him:
and they smote the Canaanites and the Perizzites.
**6.** But Adonibezek fled;
and they pursued after him, and overtook him,
and cut off the thumbs of his hands
and the great toes of his feet.
**7.** And Adonibezek said,
"Seventy kings, having the thumbs of their hands
and the great toes of their feet cut off,
were gathering [their] food from under my table:
as I have done, so hath God requited me."
And they brought him to Jerusalem,
and there he died.
**8.** Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem,
and had taken it,
and smitten it with the edge of the sword,
and set the city on fire.
**9.** And afterward the children of Judah went down
to fight against the Canaanites,
that dwelt in the mountain,
and in the south, and in the valley.
**10.** And Judah went against the Canaanites
that dwelt over against [them];
(now the name of Hebron beforetime was Kiriath Arba [that is, Sepher]);
and he smote Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai,
the children of Anak.
**11.** And from thence they went against the inhabitants of Debir;
