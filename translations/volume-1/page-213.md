14 Ζομένου τοῦ δεξιοῦ, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸ ἄκρον τῆς χειρὸς αὐτοῦ τῆς δεξιᾶς, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸ ἄκρον τοῦ ποδὸς αὐτοῦ τοῦ δεξιοῦ·
15 καὶ λαβὼν ὁ ἱερεὺς ἀπὸ τῆς κοτύλης τοῦ ἐλαίου, ἐπιχεεῖ ἐπὶ τὴν χεῖρα τοῦ ἱερέως τὴν ἀριστερὰν·
16 καὶ βάψει ὁ ἱερεὺς τὸν δάκτυλον αὐτοῦ τὸν δεξιὸν ἀπὸ τοῦ ἐλαίου τοῦ ὄντος ἐπὶ τῆς χειρὸς αὐτοῦ τῆς ἀριστερᾶς, καὶ ῥανεῖ ὁ ἱερεὺς ἀπὸ τοῦ ἐλαίου τῷ δακτύλῳ ἑπτάκις ἔναντι Κυρίου.
17 Τὸ δὲ καταλειφθὲν ἔλαιον τὸ ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ, ἐπιθήσει ὁ ἱερεὺς ἐπὶ τὸν λοβὸν τοῦ ὠτὸς τοῦ καθαριζομένου τοῦ δεξιοῦ, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸ ἄκρον τῆς χειρὸς αὐτοῦ τῆς δεξιᾶς, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸ ἄκρον τοῦ ποδὸς αὐτοῦ τοῦ δεξιοῦ, ἐπὶ τὸν τόπον τοῦ αἵματος τοῦ τῆς πλημμελείας·
18 τὸ δὲ καταλειφθὲν ἔλαιον τὸ ἐπὶ τῆς χειρὸς τοῦ ἱερέως, ἐπιθήσει ὁ ἱερεὺς ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν τοῦ καθαριζομένου,
19 καὶ ἐξιλάσεται περὶ αὐτοῦ ὁ ἱερεὺς ἔναντι Κυρίου. Καὶ ποιήσει ὁ ἱερεὺς τὸ περὶ τῆς ἁμαρτίας, καὶ ἐξιλάσεται ὁ ἱερεὺς περὶ τοῦ (ἀκαθάρτου τοῦ) καθαριζομένου ἀπὸ τῆς ἁμαρτίας αὐτοῦ·
20 καὶ μετὰ τοῦτο σφάξει ὁ ἱερεὺς τὸ ὁλοκαύτωμα· καὶ οἴσει ὁ ἱερεὺς τὸ ὁλοκαύτωμα καὶ τὴν θυσίαν ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον ἔναντι Κυρίου· καὶ ἐξιλάσεται περὶ αὐτοῦ ὁ ἱερεύς, καὶ καθαρισθήσεται.
21 Ἐὰν δὲ πέντηται, καὶ ἡ χεὶρ αὐτοῦ μὴ εὑρίσκῃ, λήψεται ἀμνὸν ἕνα εἰς ὃ ἐπλημμέλησεν εἰς ἀφαίρεμα, ὥστε ἐξιλάσασθαι περὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ δέκατον σεμιδάλεως πεφυραμένης ἐν ἐλαίῳ εἰς θυσίαν,
22 καὶ κοτύλην ἐλαίου μίαν, καὶ δύο τρυγόνας, ἢ δύο νεοσσοὺς περιστερῶν, ὅσα εὗρεν ἡ χεὶρ αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἔσται ἡ μία περὶ ἁμαρτίας, καὶ ἡ μία εἰς ὁλοκαύτωμα·
23 καὶ προσίσει αὐτὰ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ὀγδόῃ εἰς τὸ καθαρίσαι αὐτὸν πρὸς τὸν ἱερέα, ἐπὶ τὴν θύραν τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου ἔναντι Κυρίου.
24 Καὶ λαβὼν ὁ ἱερεὺς τὸν ἀμνὸν τῆς πλημμελείας, καὶ τὴν κοτύλην τοῦ ἐλαίου, ἐπιθήσει αὐτὰ ἐπίθεμα ἔναντι Κυρίου.
25 Καὶ σφάξει τὸν ἀμνὸν τῆς πλημμελείας, καὶ λήψεται ὁ ἱερεὺς ἀπὸ τοῦ αἵματος τοῦ τῆς πλημμελείας, καὶ ἐπιθήσει ἐπὶ τὸν λοβὸν τοῦ ὠτὸς τοῦ δεξιοῦ τοῦ καθαριζομένου, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸ ἄκρον τῆς χειρὸς αὐτοῦ τῆς δεξιᾶς,
26 καὶ ἐπὶ τὸ ἄκρον τοῦ ποδὸς αὐτοῦ τοῦ δεξιοῦ. Καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἐλαίου ἐπιχεεῖ ὁ ἱερεὺς ἐπὶ τὴν χεῖρα τοῦ ἱερέως τὴν ἀριστεράν,
27 καὶ ῥανεῖ ὁ ἱερεὺς τῷ δακτύλῳ αὐτοῦ τῷ δεξιῷ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἐλαίου τοῦ ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ τῇ ἀριστερᾷ ἑπτάκις ἔναντι Κυρίου·
28 καὶ ἐπιθήσει ὁ ἱερεὺς ἀπὸ τοῦ ἐλαίου τοῦ ἐπὶ τῆς χειρὸς αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ

14 When the right [limb] is yoked, and upon the tip of his right hand, and upon the tip of his right foot;
15 And the priest shall take from the cotyla of oil, and shall pour [it] upon the left hand of the priest;
16 And the priest shall dip his right finger into the oil that is upon his left hand, and the priest shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before the Lord.
17 But the remaining oil that is in his hand, the priest shall put upon the lobe of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the tip of his right hand, and upon the tip of his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass offering.
18 And the remaining oil that is upon the hand of the priest, the priest shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed,
19 and the priest shall make atonement for him before the Lord. And the priest shall perform the [rite] concerning the sin, and the priest shall make atonement for him, [even] for the (unclean [one] of the) one being cleansed from his sin.
20 And after this, the priest shall slay the burnt offering; and the priest shall bring up the burnt offering and the sacrifice upon the altar before the Lord; and the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be cleansed.
21 But if he be poor, and his hand cannot find [the means to provide], then he shall take one lamb for a trespass offering, for that wherein he hath trespassed, for a heave offering, to make atonement for him, and a tenth [part] of fine flour mingled with oil for a sacrifice,
22 and one cotyla of oil, and two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, such as his hand may find; and the one shall be for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering.
23 And he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing unto the priest, unto the door of the tabernacle of testimony before the Lord.
24 And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering, and the cotyla of oil, and he shall put them as a wave offering before the Lord.
25 And he shall slay the lamb of the trespass offering, and the priest shall take of the blood of the trespass offering, and shall put it upon the lobe of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the tip of his right hand,
