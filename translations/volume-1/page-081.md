31 ταῖς ἡγεμονίαις αὐτῶν ἐν γῇ Ἐδώμ. Καὶ οὗτοι οἱ βασιλεῖς οἱ
32 βασιλεύσαντες ἐν Ἐδώμ, πρὸ τοῦ βασιλεῦσαι βασιλέα ἐν Ἰσραήλ·
    καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ἐδὼμ Βαλάκ υἱὸς τοῦ Βεώρ· καὶ ὄνομα τῇ
33 πόλει αὐτοῦ, Δενναβά. Ἀπέθανε δὲ Βαλάκ, καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν ἀντ᾿
34 αὐτοῦ Ἰωβάβ υἱὸς Ζερὰ ἐκ Βοσόῤῥας. Ἀπέθανε δὲ Ἰωβάβ, καὶ
35 ἐβασίλευσεν ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ Ἀσώμ, ἐκ γῆς Θαιμανῶν. Ἀπέθανε δὲ
    Ἀσώμ, καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ Ἀδάδ, υἱὸς Βαράδ, ὁ ἐκκό-
    ψας Μαδιάμ ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ Μωάβ· καὶ ὄνομα τῇ πόλει αὐτοῦ, Γεθ-
36 θαίμ. Ἀπέθανε δὲ Ἀδάδ, καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ Σαλαμὰ
37 ἐκ Μασσεκκᾶς. Ἀπέθανε δὲ Σαλαμά, καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ
38 Σαούλ, ἐκ Ῥοωβώθ, τῆς παρὰ ποταμόν. Ἀπέθανε δὲ Σαούλ, καὶ
39 ἐβασίλευσεν ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ Βααλευνών, υἱὸς Ἀχοβώρ. Ἀπέθανε δὲ
    Βααλευνὼν υἱὸς Ἀχοβώρ, καὶ ἐβασίλευσεν ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ Ἀράδ, υἱὸς
    Βαράδ· καὶ ὄνομα τῇ πόλει αὐτοῦ, Φογώρ· ὄνομα δὲ τῇ γυναικὶ
40 αὐτοῦ, Μετεβεήλ, θυγάτηρ Ματραείθ, υἱοῦ Μεζόόβ. Ταῦτα τὰ
    ὀνόματα τῶν ἡγεμόνων Ἠσαῦ ἐν ταῖς φυλαῖς αὐτῶν κατὰ τόπον
    αὐτῶν, ἐν ταῖς χώραις αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν αὐτῶν· ἡγε-
41 μὼν Θαμνά, ἡγεμὼν Γωλά, ἡγεμὼν Ἰεθέρ, ἡγεμὼν Ἐλιβεμᾶς,
42 ἡγεμὼν Ἠλάς, ἡγεμὼν Φινών, ἡγεμὼν Κενέζ, ἡγεμὼν Θαιμάν,
43 ἡγεμὼν Μαζάρ, ἡγεμὼν Μεγοδίηλ, ἡγεμὼν Ζαφωείν. Οὗτοι ἡγε-
    μόνες Ἐδὼμ ἐν ταῖς κατοικοδομημέναις ἐν τῇ γῇ τῆς κτήσεως
    αὐτῶν· οὗτος Ἠσαῦ πατὴρ Ἐδώμ.

1 ΚΑΤΩΚΕΙ δὲ Ἰακὼβ ἐν τῇ γῇ, οὗ παρῴκησεν ὁ πατὴρ αὐ-
2 τοῦ, ἐν γῇ Χαναάν. Αὗται δὲ αἱ γενέσεις. Ἰακώβ· Ἰωσὴφ δε-
    καεπτά ἐτῶν, ἦν ποιμαίνων μετὰ τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτοῦ τὰ πρόβατα,
    ὢν νέος, μετὰ τῶν υἱῶν Βαλλᾶς, καὶ μετὰ τῶν υἱῶν Ζελφᾶς,
    τῶν γυναικῶν τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ. Κατήνεγκε δὲ Ἰωσὴφ φόγον
3 πονηρὸν πρὸς Ἰσραὴλ τὸν πατέρα αὐτῶν. Ἰακὼβ δὲ ἠγάπα τὸν
    Ἰωσὴφ παρὰ πάντας τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ, ὅτι υἱὸς γήρους ἦν αὐτῷ·
4 ἐποίησε δὲ αὐτῷ χιτῶνα ποικίλον. Ἰδόντες δὲ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ,
    ὅτι αὐτὸν ἐφίλει ὁ πατὴρ αὐτῶν ἐκ πάντων τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ, ἐμί-
5 σησαν αὐτόν, καὶ οὐκ ἐδύναντο λαλεῖν αὐτῷ οὐδὲν εἰρηνικόν. Ἐ-
    νυπνιασθεὶς δὲ Ἰωσὴφ ἐνύπνιον, ἀπήγγειλεν αὐτὸ τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς

### Genesis 36

31 in their chieftains in the land of Edom. And these are the kings who
32 reigned in Edom, ere any king did reign in Israel. And Balak, the son of Beor, reigned in Edom; and the name of his
33 city was Dennaba. And when Balak was dead, there reigned in his stead
34 Jobab, the son of Zerah, from Bozra. And when Jobab was dead, then
35 reigned in his stead Ashom, from the land of the Temanites. And when Ashom was dead, there reigned in his stead Adad, the son of Barad, who did smite
   Midian in the plain of Moab; and the name of his city was Getthaim.
36 And when Adad was dead, there reigned in his stead Salama
37 from Massekka. And when Salama was dead, there reigned in his stead
38 Saul, from Rehoboth by the River. And when Saul was dead, then
39 reigned in his stead Baalhanan, the son of Achobor. And when Baalhanan, the son of Achobor, was dead, there reigned in his stead Arad, the son of
   Barad; and the name of his city was Phogor; and the name of his wife was
40 Metebeēl, the daughter of Matraith, the son of Mezoob. These are the names of the chieftains of Esau, according to their families, by their places,
   in their lands, and in their nations: Chief
41 Thamna, Chief Gola, Chief Jether, Chief Elibemas,
42 Chief Elas, Chief Phinon, Chief Kenez, Chief Thaiman,
43 Chief Mazar, Chief Megodiēl, Chief Zaphoein. These are the chieftains of Edom, in their built-up settlements within the land of their possession. This is Esau, the father of Edom.

### Genesis 37

1 Now Jacob dwelt in the land where his father had sojourned, [even]
2 in the land of Canaan. And these are the generations of Jacob: Joseph, being seventeen years of age, was pasturing the sheep with his brethren,
   yet but a youth; and he was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah,
   who were his father's wives. And Joseph brought to Israel, their father, an evil report [concerning them].
3 Now Jacob loved Joseph more than all his sons, because he was the son of his old age;
4 and he made him a coat of many colours. And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they did hate
5 him, and could not speak peaceably unto him. And when Joseph had dreamed a dream, he told it to his brethren.
