16 Καὶ Ἔλαβε Νοεμμεὶν τὸ παιδίον, καὶ ἔθηκεν αὐτὸ εἰς τὸν κόλπον
   αὐτῆς· καὶ ἐγενήθη αὐτῷ εἰς τιθηνόν.
17 Καὶ ἐκάλεσαν αὐτοῦ αἱ γείτονες ὄνομα, λέγουσαι· ἐτέχθη υἱὸς τῇ
   Νωεμείν· καὶ ἐκάλεσαν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ, Ὀβήδ. Οὗτος πατὴρ Ἰεσσαί,
   πατρὸς Δαυίδ.
18 Καὶ αὗται αἱ γενέσεις Φαρές· Φαρὲς ἐγέννησε τὸν Ἑσρών.
19 Ἑσρὼν ἐγέννησε τὸν Ἀράμ· Ἀρὰμ δὲ ἐγέννησε τὸν Ἀμιναδάβ·
20 καὶ Ἀμιναδὰβ ἐγέννησε τὸν Ναασσών· καὶ Ναασσὼν ἐγέννησε τὸν
   Σαλμών·
21 καὶ Σαλμὼν ἐγέννησε τὸν Βοός· καὶ Βοὸς ἐγέννησε τὸν Ὀβήδ·
22 καὶ Ὀβὴδ ἐγέννησε τὸν Ἰεσσαί· καὶ Ἰεσσαὶ ἐγέννησε τὸν Δαυὶδ τὸν
   βασιλέα.
