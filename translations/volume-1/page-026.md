ΚΕΦ. Ζ´. ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ
διαθρέψαι σπέρμα ἐπὶ πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν. Ἔτι γὰρ ἡμερῶν ἑπτά, 4
ἐγὼ ἐπάγω ὑετὸν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν τεσσαράκοντα ἡμέρας καὶ
τεσσαράκοντα νύκτας, καὶ ἐξαλείψω πᾶν τὸ ἀνάστημα ὃ ἐποίησα,
ἀπὸ προσώπου τῆς γῆς. Καὶ ἐποίησε Νῶε πάντα ὅσα ἐνετείλα- 5
το αὐτῷ Κύριος ὁ Θεός. Νῶε δὲ ἦν ἐτῶν ἑξακοσίων, καὶ ὁ κα- 6
τακλυσμὸς ἦν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς. Εἰσῆλθε δὲ Νῶε καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ, 7
καὶ ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ, καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ
εἰς τὴν κιβωτὸν, διὰ τὸ ὕδωρ τοῦ κατακλυσμοῦ. (Καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν 8
πετεινῶν), καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν κτηνῶν τῶν καθαρῶν, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν κτη-
νῶν τῶν μὴ καθαρῶν, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν πετεινῶν, καὶ ἀπὸ πάντων
τῶν ἑρπετῶν τῶν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς· δύο δύο εἰσῆλθον πρὸς Νῶε εἰς 9
τὴν κιβωτὸν, ἄρσεν καὶ θῆλυ, καθὰ ἐνετείλατο αὐτῷ ὁ Θεός.
Καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ τὰς ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας, καὶ τὸ ὕδωρ τοῦ κατακλυ- 10
σμοῦ ἐγένετο ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς. Ἐν τῷ ἑξακοσιοστῷ ἔτει ἐν τῇ ζωῇ 11
τοῦ Νῶε, τοῦ δευτέρου μηνὸς, ἑβδόμῃ καὶ εἰκάδι τοῦ μηνὸς, τῇ
ἡμέρᾳ ταύτῃ ἐῤῥάγησαν πᾶσαι αἱ πηγαὶ τῆς ἀβύσσου, καὶ οἱ κα-
ταῤῥάκται τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ἠνεῴχθησαν· καὶ ἐγένετο ὁ ὑετὸς ἐπὶ τῆς 12
γῆς τεσσαράκοντα ἡμέρας καὶ τεσσαράκοντα νύκτας. Ἐν τῇ ἡμέ- 13
ρᾳ ταύτῃ εἰσῆλθε Νῶε, Σὴμ, Χὰμ, Ἰάφεθ, υἱοὶ Νῶε, καὶ ἡ γυ-
νὴ Νῶε, καὶ αἱ τρεῖς γυναῖκες τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ εἰς
τὴν κιβωτὸν· καὶ πάντα τὰ θηρία κατὰ γένος, καὶ πάντα τὰ κτή- 14
νη κατὰ γένος, καὶ πᾶν ἑρπετὸν κινούμενον ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς κατὰ
γένος, καὶ πᾶν πετεινὸν κατὰ γένος αὐτοῦ. Εἰσῆλθον πρὸς Νῶε 15
εἰς τὴν κιβωτὸν, δύο δύο, ἄρσεν καὶ θῆλυ, ἀπὸ πάσης σαρκὸς
ἐν ᾧ ἐστι πνεῦμα ζωῆς· καὶ τὰ εἰσπορευόμενα ἄρσεν καὶ θῆλυ 16
ἀπὸ πάσης σαρκὸς εἰσῆλθε, καθὰ ἐνετείλατο ὁ Θεὸς τῷ Νῶε·
καὶ ἔκλεισε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τὴν κιβωτὸν ἔξωθεν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐγέ- 17

ἐπῆρε τὴν κιβωτὸν, καὶ ὑψώθη ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς· καὶ ἐπεκράτει τὸ 18
ὕδωρ, καὶ ἐπληθύνετο σφόδρα ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἐπεφέρετο ἡ κι-

**Chapter 7**

4 That they might preserve seed upon all the earth. For yet seven days, I will bring a rain upon the earth for forty days and forty nights, and I will blot out all the living substance which I have made from the face of the earth.

5 And Noah did all things whatsoever the Lord God commanded him.

6 And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.

7 And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.

8 (And from the fowls), and from the clean beasts, and from the beasts that are not clean, and from the fowls, and from all creeping things that creep upon the earth;

9 Two by two they entered unto Noah into the ark, male and female, as God commanded him.

10 And it came to pass after the seven days, that the water of the flood was upon the earth.

11 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the twenty-seventh day of the month, on that very day all the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the cataracts of heaven were opened.

12 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.

13 On that selfsame day Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, entered into the ark;

14 And every beast after his kind, and all cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind.

15 They entered unto Noah into the ark, two by two, male and female, of all flesh wherein is the breath of life;

16 And those that entered, male and female of all flesh, entered as God commanded Noah; and the Lord God shut the ark from without upon him.

17 And the flood was upon the earth forty days and forty nights (upon the earth); and the waters increased, and bore up the ark, and it was lifted up from the earth.

18 And the waters prevailed, and increased exceedingly upon the earth; and the ark was borne upon the face of the waters.

19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly and very greatly upon the earth; and they covered all the high mountains which were under heaven.

20 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and they covered all the high mountains.

21 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, of fowl, and of cattle, and
