ΛΕΥΙΤΙΚΟΝ ΚΕΦ. ΙΖ.
**3** μαρτυρίου μὴ ἐνέγκῃ, ὥστε ποιῆσαι αὐτὸ εἰς ὁλοκαύτωμα ἢ σωτήριον Κυρίῳ δεκτόν, εἰς ὀσμὴν εὐωδίας, καὶ ὃς ἂν σφάξῃ ἔξω, καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν θύραν τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου μὴ ἐνέγκῃ αὐτό, ὥστε (μὴ) προσενέγκαι δῶρον Κυρίου ἀπέναντι τῆς σκηνῆς Κυρίου, (καὶ) λογισθήσεται τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ ἐκείνῳ αἷμα· αἷμα ἐξέχεεν, ἐξολοθρευθήσεται ἡ ψυχὴ ἐκείνη ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτῆς·
**5** ὅπως ἀναφέρωσιν οἱ υἱοὶ ᾿Ισραὴλ τὰς θυσίας αὐτῶν, ὅσας ἂν αὐτοὶ σφάξωσιν ἐν τοῖς πεδίοις, καὶ οἴσουσιν αὐτὰ τῷ Κυρίῳ ἐπὶ τὰς θύρας τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου πρὸς τὸν ἱερέα, καὶ θύσουσι θυσίαν σωτηρίου τῷ Κυρίῳ αὐτά.
**6** Καὶ προσάξει ὁ ἱερεὺς τὸ αἷμα ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον κύκλῳ ἀπέναντι Κυρίου παρὰ τὰς θύρας τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου· καὶ ἀνοίσει τὸ στέαρ εἰς ὀσμὴν εὐωδίας Κυρίῳ.
**7** Καὶ οὐ θύσουσιν ἔτι τὰς θυσίας αὐτῶν τοῖς ματαίοις, οἷς αὐτοὶ ἐκπορνεύσουσιν ὀπίσω αὐτῶν· νόμιμον αἰώνιον ἔσται ὑμῖν εἰς τὰς γενεὰς ὑμῶν.
**8** Καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτούς· ἄνθρωπος ἄνθρωπος τῶν υἱῶν ᾿Ισραὴλ, καὶ ἀπὸ (τῶν υἱῶν) τῶν προσηλύτων τῶν προσκειμένων ἐν ὑμῖν, ὃς ἂν ποιήσῃ ὁλοκαύτωμα ἢ θυσίαν,
**9** καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν θύραν τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου μὴ ἐνέγκῃ ποιῆσαι αὐτὸ τῷ Κυρίῳ, ἐξολοθρευθήσεται ὁ ἄνθρωπος ἐκεῖνος ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ.
**10** Καὶ ἄνθρωπος ἄνθρωπος τῶν υἱῶν ᾿Ισραὴλ, ἢ τῶν προσηλύτων τῶν προσκειμένων ἐν ὑμῖν, ὃς ἂν φάγῃ πᾶν αἷμα, καὶ ἐπιστήσω τὸ πρόσωπόν μου ἐπὶ τὴν ψυχὴν τὴν ἐσθίουσαν τὸ αἷμα, καὶ ἀπολῶ αὐτὴν ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτῆς.
**11** Ἡ γὰρ ψυχὴ πάσης σαρκὸς αἷμα αὐτοῦ ἐστι, καὶ ἐγὼ δέδωκα αὐτὸ ὑμῖν ἐπὶ τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου ἐξιλάσκεσθαι περὶ τῶν ψυχῶν ὑμῶν· τὸ γὰρ αἷμα αὐτὸ ἀντὶ τῆς ψυχῆς ἐξιλάσκεται.
**12** Διὰ τοῦτο εἴρηκα τοῖς υἱοῖς ᾿Ισραήλ· πᾶσα ψυχὴ ἐξ ὑμῶν οὐ φάγεται αἷμα, καὶ ὁ προσήλυτος ὁ προσκειμένος ἐν ὑμῖν οὐ φάγεται αἷμα.
**13** Καὶ ἄνθρωπος ἄνθρωπος τῶν υἱῶν ᾿Ισραὴλ, καὶ τῶν προσηλύτων τῶν προσκειμένων ἐν ὑμῖν, ὃς ἂν θηρεύσῃ θήρευμα, θηρίον ἢ πετεινὸν, ὃ ἔσθεται, καὶ ἐκχεεῖ τὸ αἷμα αὐτοῦ, καὶ καλύψει αὐτὸ τῇ γῇ·
**14** ἡ γὰρ ψυχὴ πάσης σαρκὸς αἷμα αὐτοῦ ἐστι. Καὶ εἶπα τοῖς υἱοῖς ᾿Ισραήλ· αἷμα πάσης σαρκὸς οὐ φάγεσθε, ὅτι ἡ ψυχὴ πάσης σαρκὸς αἷμα αὐτοῦ ἐστι· πᾶς δὲ ἔσθων αὐτὸ, ἐξολοθρευθήσεται.
**15** Καὶ πᾶσα ψυχὴ, ἥτις φάγεται θνησιμαῖον, ἢ θηριάλωτον ἐν τοῖς αὐτόχθοσιν, ἢ ἐν τοῖς προσήλυτοις, πλυνεῖ τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ, καὶ λούσεται ὕδατι, καὶ ἀκά-

**3** ...shall not bring it, that he may make it a burnt offering or a peace offering acceptable unto the Lord, for a sweet savor. And whosoever shall slay [an animal] outside, and shall not bring it unto the door of the tabernacle of testimony, so as [thereby] not to offer a gift unto the Lord before the tabernacle of the Lord, [then] blood shall be reckoned unto that man; he hath shed blood, and that soul shall be cut off from among her people.
**5** This is that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they slay in the open fields, and bring them unto the Lord, unto the doors of the tabernacle of the testimony, unto the priest, and sacrifice them as peace offerings unto the Lord.
**6** And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about, before the Lord, beside the doors of the tabernacle of the testimony; and he shall offer up the fat for a sweet savor unto the Lord.
**7** And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto the false gods, after whom they commit whoredom; this shall be a statute for ever unto you throughout your generations.
**8** And thou shalt say unto them: Whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of [the sons of] the strangers who sojourn among you, that offereth a burnt offering or a sacrifice,
**9** and bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the testimony, to make it unto the Lord, that man shall be cut off from among his people.
**10** And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of blood, I will even set My face against that soul that eateth the blood, and will cut him off from among his people.
**11** For the life of all flesh is its blood; and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is the blood that maketh atonement for the soul.
**12** Therefore have I said unto the children of Israel: No soul among you shall eat blood; neither shall the stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood.
**13** And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn among you, who hunteth and taketh any beast or fowl that may be eaten, he shall even pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with earth;
**14** For the life of all flesh is its blood. And I said unto the children of Israel: Ye shall not eat the blood of any flesh; for the life of all flesh is its blood. Whosoever eateth it shall be cut off.
**15** And every soul that eateth that which dieth of itself, or that which is torn by beasts, whether he be one of your own nation, or a stranger, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be un-[clean]
