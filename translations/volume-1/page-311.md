48 Κυρίου, ὃν τρόπον συνέταξε. Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ. Καὶ προσῆλθον
    πρὸς Μωυσῆν πάντες οἱ καθεσταμένοι εἰς τὰς χιλιαρχίας τῆς
49 δυνάμεως χιλίαρχοι καὶ ἑκατόνταρχοι, καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς Μωυσῆν,
    οἱ παῖδες σου εἰλήφασι τὸ κεφάλαιον τῶν ἀνδρῶν τῶν πολεμιστῶν
50 τῶν παρ᾿ ἡμῖν, καὶ οὐ διαπεφώνηκεν ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν οὐδὲ εἷς· καὶ
    προσηνεγκόμεν τὸ δῶρον Κυρίῳ, ἀνὴρ ὃ εὗρε σκεῦος χρυσοῦν,
    χλιδῶνα καὶ ψέλλιον καὶ δακτύλιον καὶ περιδέξιον καὶ ἐμπλόκιον,
51 ἐξιλάσασθαι περὶ ψυχῶν ἡμῶν ἔναντι Κυρίου. Καὶ ἔλαβε Μωυσῆς
    καὶ Ἐλεάζαρ ὁ ἱερεὺς τὸ χρυσίον παρ᾿ αὐτῶν, πᾶν σκεῦος εἰρ-
52 γασμένον· καὶ ἐγένετο πᾶν τὸ χρυσίον τὸ ἀφαίρεμα ὃ ἀφεῖλον
    Κυρίῳ, ἕξ καὶ δέκα χιλιάδες καὶ ἑπτακόσιοι καὶ πεντήκοντα οἵ-
53 κλοι παρὰ τῶν χιλιάρχων καὶ παρὰ τῶν ἑκατοντάρχων. Καὶ οἱ
54 ἄνδρες οἱ πολεμισταὶ ἐπρονόμευσαν ἕκαστος ἑαυτῷ. Καὶ ἔλαβε
    Μωυσῆς καὶ Ἐλεάζαρ ὁ ἱερεὺς τὸ χρυσίον παρὰ τῶν χιλιάρχων
    καὶ παρὰ τῶν ἑκατοντάρχων, καὶ εἰσήνεγκαν αὐτὰ εἰς τὴν σκηνὴν
    τοῦ μαρτυρίου, μνημόσυνον τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ ἔναντι Κυρίου.

ΚΕΦ. ΛΒʹ. XXXII.

1 ΚΑΙ κτήνη, πλῆθος ἦν τοῖς υἱοῖς Ῥουβήν, καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς Γάδ,
    πλῆθος πολὺ σφόδρα· καὶ ἴδον τὴν χώραν Ἰαζήρ, καὶ τὴν χώραν
2 Γαλαάδ, καὶ ἦν ὁ τόπος τόπος κτήνεσι. Καὶ προσελθόντες οἱ υἱοὶ
    Ῥουβήν καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Γάδ, εἶπαν πρὸς Μωυσῆν καὶ πρὸς Ἐλεάζαρ
3 τὸν ἱερέα καὶ πρὸς τοὺς ἄρχοντας τῆς συναγωγῆς, λέγοντες· Ἀταρὼθ
    καὶ Δαιβών, καὶ Ἰαζήρ, καὶ Ναμρά, καὶ Ἐσεβών, καὶ Ἐλεαλή,
4 καὶ Σεβαμά, καὶ Ναβαῦ, καὶ Βαιάν, τὴν γῆν ἣν παρέδωκε
    Κύριος ἐνώπιον υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, κτηνοτρόφος γῆ ἐστι, καὶ τοῖς
5 παισί σου κτήνη ὑπάρχει. Καὶ ἐλέγοσαν· εἰ εὕρομεν χάριν ἐναντίον
    σου, δοθήτω ἡ γῆ αὕτη τοῖς παισί σου ἐν κατασχέσει, καὶ
6 μὴ διαβιβάσῃς ἡμᾶς τὸν Ἰορδάνην. Καὶ εἶπε Μωυσῆς τοῖς υἱοῖς
    Γὰδ καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς Ῥουβήν· οἱ ἀδελφοὶ ὑμῶν πορεύσονται εἰς πόλεμον,
7 καὶ ὑμεῖς καθήσεσθε αὐτοῦ; καὶ ἵνατί διαστρέφετε τὰς
    καρδίας τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, μὴ διαβῆναι εἰς τὴν γῆν, ἣν Κύριος
8 δίδωσιν αὐτοῖς; Οὐχ οὕτως ἐποίησαν οἱ πατέρες ὑμῶν, ὅτε ἀπέστειλα
    αὐτοὺς ἐκ Κάδης Βαρνῆ, κατανοῆσαι τὴν γῆν,
9 καὶ ἀνέδησαν ἕως φάραγγα βότρυος, καὶ κατενόησαν τὴν γῆν, καὶ ἀπέστησαν

### NUMBERS CHAPTER XXXI

48 of the Lord, in the manner which He ordained. The Lord [spake] unto Moses. And there drew nigh unto Moses all they that were set over the thousands of the army, the captains over thousands and the captains over hundreds,
49 and they said unto Moses, “Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war
50 that were with us, and there hath not failed of them one man. And we have brought near the offering unto the Lord, each man that which he found, a golden vessel,
51 a bracelet and an armband and a ring and an armlet and a necklace, to make atonement for our souls before the Lord.”
52 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from them, every wrought vessel. And all the gold that was taken, which they offered
53 unto the Lord, was sixteen thousand and seven hundred and fifty shekels, from the captains over thousands and from the captains over hundreds.
54 And the men of war had plundered, each man for himself. And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from the captains over thousands and from the captains over hundreds, and brought them into the tabernacle
55 of witness, for a memorial of the sons of Israel before the Lord.

### CHAPTER XXXII

1 Now there was cattle, a very great multitude, unto the sons of Reuben and unto the sons of Gad. And they saw the land of Jazer and the land
2 of Gilead, and the place was a place for cattle. And the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad drew nigh, and they spake unto Moses and unto Eleazar
3 the priest, and unto the princes of the congregation, saying, “Ataroth and Dibon, and Jazer and Nimrah, and Heshbon and Elealeh,
4 and Sebamah and Nebo and Beon, the land which the Lord hath delivered before the sons of Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle.
5 And they said, 'If we have found grace in thy sight, let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession, and
6 bring us not over Jordan.' ” And Moses said unto the sons of Gad and unto the sons of Reuben, “Shall your brethren go to war,
7 and ye yourselves sit here? And wherefore do ye turn aside the hearts of the sons of Israel from going over into the land which the Lord
8 giveth unto them? Did not your fathers do thus, when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land,
9 and they bound up unto the valley of the Cluster of grapes, and they spied out the land, and they turned aside
