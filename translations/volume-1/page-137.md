Here is the translated text, with the original Greek and then the English translation:

```
27 ὕδωρ, καὶ ἐπικαλυψάτω τοὺς Αἰγυπτίους, ἐπί τε τὰ ἅρματα καὶ
   ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀναβάτας. Ἐξέτεινε δὲ Μωσῆς τὴν χεῖρα ἐπὶ τὴν θά-
   λασσαν, καὶ ἀπεκατέστη τὸ ὕδωρ πρὸς ἡμέραν ἐπὶ χώρας· οἱ δὲ
   Αἰγύπτιοι ἔφυγον ὑπὸ τὸ ὕδωρ καὶ ἐξετίναξε Κύριος τοὺς Αἰγυ-
28 πτίους εἰς μέσον τῆς θαλάσσης. Καὶ ἐπαναστραφὲν τὸ ὕδωρ ἐκά-
   λυψε τὰ ἅρματα καὶ τοὺς ἀναβάτας, καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν δύναμιν Φα-
   ραώ, τοὺς εἰσπορευομένους ὀπίσω αὐτῶν εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν οὐ
29 κατελείφθη ἐξ αὐτῶν οὐδὲ εἷς. Οἱ δὲ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐπορεύθησαν διὰ
   ξηρᾶς ἐν μέσῳ τῆς θαλάσσης· τὸ δὲ ὕδωρ αὐτοῖς τεῖχος ἐκ δε-
30 ξιῶν, καὶ τεῖχος ἐξ εὐωνύμων. Καὶ ἐῤῥύσατο Κύριος τὸν Ἰσραὴλ
   ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἐκ χειρὸς Αἰγυπτίων· καὶ ἴδεν Ἰσραὴλ τοὺς
31 Αἰγυπτίους τεθνηκότας παρὰ τὸ χεῖλος τῆς θαλάσσης. Καὶ ἴδεν
   Ἰσραὴλ τὴν χεῖρα τὴν μεγάλην, ἃ ἐποίησε Κύριος τοῖς Αἰγυ-
   πτίοις· καὶ ἐφοβήθη ὁ λαὸς τὸν Κύριον, καὶ ἐπίστευσαν τῷ Θεῷ,
   καὶ Μωσῇ τῷ θεράποντι αὐτοῦ.

               ΚΕΦ. ΙΕ´. ΧV

1  ΤΟΤΕ ᾖσε Μωσῆς καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ τὴν ᾠδὴν ταύτην τῷ
   Κυρίῳ, καὶ εἶπαν, τῷ λέγειν· Ἄσωμεν τῷ Κυρίῳ, ἐνδόξως γὰρ
2  δεδόξασται· ἵππον καὶ ἀναβάτην ἔῤῥιψεν εἰς θάλασσαν. Βοηθὸς καὶ
   σκεπαστὴς ἐγένετό μοι εἰς σωτηρίαν· οὗτός μου Θεός, καὶ δοξά-
3  σω αὐτόν. Θεὸς τοῦ πατρός μου, καὶ ὑψώσω αὐτόν. Κύριος συν-
4  τρίβων πολέμους· Κύριος ὄνομα αὐτῷ. Ἄρματα Φαραὼ καὶ τὴν
   δύναμιν αὐτοῦ ἔῤῥιψεν εἰς θάλασσαν· ἐπιλέκτους ἀναβάτας τρι-
5  στάτας κατεπόντισεν ἐν ἐρυθρᾷ θαλάσσῃ, πόντῳ ἐκάλυψεν αὐτούς·
6  κατέδυσαν εἰς βυθὸν ὡσεὶ λίθος. Ἡ δεξιά σου, Κύριε, δεδόξασται
7  ἐν ἰσχύϊ· ἡ δεξιά σου χείρ, Κύριε, ἔθραυσεν ἐχθρούς. Καὶ τῷ πλή-
   θει τῆς δόξης σου συνέτριψας τοὺς ὑπεναντίους· ἀπέστειλας τὴν
8  ὀργήν σου, καὶ κατέφαγεν αὐτοὺς ὡς καλάμην. Καὶ διὰ πνεύμα-
   τος τοῦ θυμοῦ σου διέστη τὸ ὕδωρ· ἐπάγη ὡσεὶ τεῖχος τὰ ὕδατα,
9  ἐπάγη τὰ κύματα ἐν μέσῳ τῆς θαλάσσης. Εἶπεν ὁ ἐχθρός· διώ-
   ξας καταλήψομαι, μεριῶ σκῦλα, ἐμπλήσω ψυχήν μου, ἀνελῶ τῇ
10 μαχαίρᾳ μου, κυριεύσει ἡ χείρ μου. Ἀπέστειλας τὸ πνεῦμά σου,
   (καὶ) ἐκάλυψεν αὐτοὺς θάλασσα· ἔδυσαν ὡσεὶ μόλιβος ἐν ὕδατι
11 σφοδρῷ. Τίς ὅμοιός σοι· ἐν θεοῖς, Κύριε, τίς ὅμοιός σοι; δεδόξα-

### The Book of Exodus

#### Chapter 14

27 water, and let it cover the Egyptians, both their chariots and their riders. And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea; and the water returned by day to its place. And the Egyptians fled from under the water; and the Lord did shake off the Egyptians into the midst of the sea.
28 And the water, having returned, covered the chariots and the riders, and all the host of Pharaoh, those who went into the sea after them; there was not one of them left.
29 But the children of Israel went upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the water was a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.
30 Thus the Lord delivered Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the shore of the sea.
31 And Israel saw that great hand, which the Lord had wrought upon the Egyptians; and the people feared the Lord, and believed in God, and in Moses His servant.

#### Chapter 15

1 Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord, and spake, saying:
Let us sing unto the Lord, for gloriously hath He been glorified;
The horse and the rider hath He cast into the sea.
2 A helper and a protector hath He been unto me for salvation.
This is my God, and I will glorify Him.
3 The God of my father, and I will exalt Him.
The Lord, shattering wars;
The Lord is His name.
4 Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath He cast into the sea;
His chosen riders, even his tristata captains, hath He drowned in the Red Sea.
5 The deep hath covered them;
They sank into the depths as a stone.
6 Thy right hand, O Lord, is glorified in strength;
Thy right hand, O Lord, hath shattered the foe.
7 And in the greatness of Thy glory hast Thou overthrown thine adversaries;
Thou didst send forth Thy wrath, and it devoured them as stubble.
8 And by the blast of Thy wrath the waters were parted;
The waters were congealed as a wall, the billows were congealed in the midst of the sea.
9 The enemy said, "I will pursue, I will overtake,
I will divide the spoil; my soul shall be satisfied [upon them];
I will draw my sword, my hand shall possess."
10 Thou didst send forth Thy spirit, and the sea covered them;
They sank as lead in the mighty waters.
11 Who is like unto Thee among the gods, O Lord?
Who is like unto Thee, glorious—
