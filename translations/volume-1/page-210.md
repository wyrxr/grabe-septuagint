ΚΕΦ. ΙΓ´. ΛΕΥΙΤΙΚΟΝ 195
ἐν αὐτῇ δὲ θρὶξ ξανθίζουσα λεπτὴ, καὶ μιανεῖ αὐτὸν ὁ ἱερεὺς·
θραῦσμά ἐστι, λέπρα (ἐστὶ) τῆς κεφαλῆς, ἢ λέπρα τοῦ πώγωνός
ἐστι. Καὶ ἐὰν ἴδῃ ὁ ἱερεὺς τὴν ἀφὴν τοῦ θραύσματος, καὶ ἰδοὺ 31
οὐχ ἡ ὄψις ἐγκοιλοτέρα τοῦ δέρματος, καὶ θρὶξ ξανθίζουσα οὐκ
ἔστιν ἐν αὐτῇ, καὶ ἀφοριεῖ ὁ ἱερεὺς τὴν ἀφὴν τοῦ θραύσματος
ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας· καὶ ὄψεται ὁ ἱερεὺς τὴν ἀφὴν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ, 32
καὶ ἰδοὺ οὐ διεχύθη τὸ θραῦσμα, καὶ θρὶξ ξανθίζουσα οὐκ ἔστιν
ἐν αὐτῇ, καὶ ἡ ὄψις τοῦ θραύσματος οὐκ ἔστι κοίλη ἀπὸ τοῦ δέρματος,
καὶ ξυρήσεται τὸ δέρμα, τὸ δὲ θραῦσμα οὐ ξυρηθήσεται, 33
καὶ ἀφοριεῖ ὁ ἱερεὺς τὸ θραῦσμα ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας τοῦ δευτέρου·
καὶ ὄψεται ὁ ἱερεὺς τὸ θραῦσμα τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ, καὶ ἰδοὺ 34
οὐ διεχύθη τὸ θραῦσμα ἐν τῷ δέρματι μετὰ τὸ ξυρῆσθαι αὐτόν,
καὶ ἡ ὄψις τοῦ θραύσματος οὐκ ἔστι κοίλη ἀπὸ τοῦ δέρματος,
καὶ καθαριεῖ αὐτὸν ὁ ἱερεὺς· καὶ πλυνάμενος τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ,
καθαρός ἔσται. Ἐὰν δὲ διαχέηται τὸ θραῦσμα ἐν 35
τῷ δέρματι μετὰ τὸ καθαρισθῆναι αὐτὸν, καὶ ὄψεται αὐτὸν ὁ ἱερεὺς, 36
καὶ ἰδοὺ διαχέχυται τὸ θραῦσμα ἐν τῷ δέρματι, οὐκ ἐπισκέψεται
ὁ ἱερεὺς περὶ τῆς τριχὸς τῆς ξανθῆς· (ὅτι) ἀκάθαρτός ἐστιν. Ἐὰν 37
δὲ ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ μείνῃ τὸ θραῦσμα ἐπὶ χώρας, καὶ θρὶξ μέλαινα
ἀνατείλῃ ἐν αὐτῷ, ὑγίακε τὸ θραῦσμα, καθαρός ἐστι· καὶ κα-
θαριεῖ αὐτὸν ὁ ἱερεύς. Καὶ ἀνδρὶ ἢ γυναικὶ ἐὰν γένηται ἐν δέρ- 38
ματι τῆς σαρκὸς αὐτοῦ αὐγάσματα αὐγάζοντα λευκανθίζοντα,
καὶ ὄψεται ὁ ἱερεὺς, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐν δέρματι τῆς σαρκὸς αὐτοῦ αὐ- 39
γάσματα αὐγάζοντα λευκανθίζοντα, ἀλφός ἐστι, (καθαρὸς ἐστιν)·
ἐξανθεῖ ἐν τῷ δέρματι τῆς σαρκὸς αὐτοῦ, καθαρός ἐστιν. Ἐὰν δὲ 40
τινι μαδήσῃ ἡ κεφαλὴ αὐτοῦ, φαλακρός ἐστι, καθαρός ἐστιν· ἐὰν 41
δὲ κατὰ πρόσωπον μαδήσῃ ἡ κεφαλὴ αὐτοῦ, ἀναφαλαντός ἐστι,
καθαρός ἐστιν. Ἐὰν δὲ γένηται ἐν τῷ φαλακρώματι αὐτοῦ ἢ ἐν 42
τῷ ἀναφαλαντώματι αὐτοῦ ἀφὴ λευκὴ ἢ πυῤῥίζουσα, λέπρα ἐστιν
ἐξανθοῦσα ἐν τῷ φαλακρώματι αὐτοῦ, ἢ ἐν τῷ ἀναφαλαντώματι
αὐτοῦ· καὶ ὄψεται αὐτὸν ὁ ἱερεὺς, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἡ ὄψις τῆς ἀφῆς λευκὴ 43
ἢ πυῤῥίζουσα ἐν τῷ φαλακρώματι αὐτοῦ ἢ ἐν τῷ ἀναφαλαντώματι
αὐτοῦ, ὡς εἶδος λέπρας ἐν δέρματι τῆς σαρκὸς αὐτοῦ,
ἄνθρωπος λεπρός ἐστιν, ἀκάθαρτός ἐστι· μιάνει μιανεῖ αὐτὸν ὁ 44
ἱερεὺς, ἐν τῇ κεφαλῇ αὐτοῦ ἡ ἀφὴ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ὁ λεπρὸς ἐν ᾧ ἔστιν 45
ἡ ἀφὴ, τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ ἔσται παραλελυμένα, καὶ ἡ κεφαλὴ αὐτοῦ

#### CHAPTER XIII

**30** if there be in it a thin, yellowish hair, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a breaking out, a leprosy of the head, or it is a leprosy of the beard.
**31** And if the priest behold the plague of the breaking out, and, lo, the appearance thereof is not deeper than the skin, and no yellowish hair is therein, then shall the priest sequester the plague of the breaking out seven days.
**32** And the priest shall behold the plague on the seventh day; and, behold, if the breaking out hath not spread, and no yellowish hair is therein, and the appearance of the breaking out is not hollow from the skin,
**33** then shall he shave the skin, but the breaking out shall he not shave; and the priest shall sequester the breaking out seven days a second time.
**34** And the priest shall behold the breaking out on the seventh day; and, behold, if the breaking out hath not spread in the skin after he was shaved, and the appearance of the breaking out is not hollow from the skin, then shall the priest pronounce him clean; and when he hath washed his garments, he shall be clean.
**35** But if the breaking out spreadeth abroad in the skin after he hath been pronounced clean,
**36** then the priest shall behold him, and, lo, the breaking out hath spread in the skin; he shall not examine concerning the yellowish hair, for he is unclean.
**37** But if the breaking out remain in its place before him, and black hair groweth up therein, then the breaking out is healed; he is clean. And the priest shall pronounce him clean.
**38** And if a man or a woman hath in the skin of his flesh shining spots that glisten, being somewhat white,
**39** then the priest shall behold; and, lo, in the skin of his flesh are shining spots that glisten, being somewhat white, it is alfas [a kind of rash], he is clean; it bloometh forth in the skin of his flesh, he is clean.
**40** And if a man's head be bereft of hair, he is bald; he is clean.
**41** And if his head be bereft of hair in the forepart, he is forehead-bald; he is clean.
**42** But if there be in his baldness or in his forehead-baldness a white or reddish plague, it is leprosy breaking out in his baldness, or in his forehead-baldness.
**43** And the priest shall behold him, and, lo, the appearance of the plague is white or reddish in his baldness or in his forehead-baldness, as the appearance of leprosy in the skin of his flesh,
**44** a leprous man is he, he is unclean; the priest shall surely pronounce him unclean, for in his head is his plague.
**45** And the leper, in whom the plague is, his garments shall be rent, and his head
