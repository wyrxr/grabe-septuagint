18 μαρτίαν κομιοῦνται. Καὶ ἀνὴρ ὃς ἂν κοιμηθῇ μετὰ γυναικὸς ἀποκαθημένης, καὶ ἀποκαλύψῃ τὴν ἀσχημοσύνην αὐτῆς, τὴν πηγὴν αὐτῆς ἀπεκάλυψε, καὶ αὕτη ἀπεκάλυψε τὴν ῥύσιν τοῦ αἵματος
19 αὐτῆς, ἐξολοθρευθήσονται ἀμφότεροι ἐκ τοῦ γένους αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἀσχημοσύνην ἀδελφῆς πατρός σου καὶ ἀδελφῆς μητρός σου οὐκ ἀποκαλύψεις· τὴν γὰρ οἰκειότητα ἀπεκάλυψεν, ἁμαρτίαν αὐτῶν
20 ἀποίσοπται. Καὶ ἄνθρωπος, ὃς ἂν κοιμηθῇ μετὰ τῆς συγγενοῦς αὐτοῦ, ἀσχημοσύνην τῆς συγγενείας αὐτοῦ ἀπεκάλυψεν· ἁμαρτίαν
21 αὐτῶν λήψονται, ἄτεκνοι ἀποθανοῦνται. Καὶ ἄνθρωπος, ὃς ἂν λάβῃ τὴν γυναῖκα τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ, ἀκαθαρσία ἐστίν· ἀσχημοσύνην
22 τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ ἀπεκάλυψεν, ἄτεκνοι ἀποθανοῦνται. Καὶ φυλάξασθε πάντα τὰ προστάγματά μου, καὶ πάντα τὰ κρίματά μου, ποιεῖν αὐτά, καὶ οὐ μὴ προσχθίσῃ ὑμῖν ἡ γῆ, εἰς ἣν ἐγὼ εἰ-
23 σάγω ὑμᾶς ἐκεῖ, κατοικεῖν ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς. Καὶ οὐχὶ πορεύεσθε ἐν τοῖς νομίμοις τῶν ἐθνῶν, οὓς ἐξαποστελῶ ἀφ᾿ ὑμῶν, ὅτι ταῦτα πάντα
24 ἐποίησαν, καὶ ἐβδελυξάμην αὐτούς. Καὶ εἶπα ὑμῖν· ὑμεῖς κληρονομήσετε τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐγὼ δώσω ὑμῖν αὐτὴν ἐν κτήσει, γῆν ῥέουσαν γάλα καὶ μέλι· ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν, ὃς διώ-
25 ρισα ὑμᾶς ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν ἐθνῶν. Καὶ ἀφοριεῖτε αὐτοὺς ἀναμέσον τῶν κτηνῶν τῶν καθαρῶν καὶ ἀναμέσον (τῶν κτηνῶν) τῶν ἀκαθάρτων, καὶ ἀναμέσον τῶν πετεινῶν τῶν ἀκαθάρτων καὶ τῶν καθαρῶν· καὶ οὐ βδελύξετε τὰς ψυχὰς ὑμῶν ἐν τοῖς κτήνεσι, καὶ ἐν τοῖς πετεινοῖς, καὶ ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς ἑρπετοῖς τῆς γῆς, ἃ ἐγὼ ἀ-
26 φώρισα ὑμῖν ἐν ἀκαθαρσίᾳ. Καὶ ἔσεσθέ μοι ἅγιοι, ὅτι ἐγὼ ἅγιός (εἰμι) Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν, ὁ ἀφορίσας ὑμᾶς ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν
27 ἐθνῶν, εἶναι ἐμοί. Καὶ ἀνὴρ ἢ γυνὴ ὃς ἂν γένηται αὐτῶν ἐγγα-
   στρίμυθος ἢ ἐπαοιδός, θανάτῳ θανατούσθωσαν ἀμφότεροι· λίθοις
   λιθοβολήσατε αὐτούς, ἔνοχοι εἰσι.

1 ΚΑΙ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, λέγων· εἶπον τοῖς ἱερεῦσι τοῖς

2 σονται ἐν τῷ ἔθνει αὐτῶν, ἀλλ᾿ ἢ ἐν τῷ οἰκείῳ τῷ ἔγγιστα αὐ-
3 σιν, ἐπὶ πατρί, καὶ ἐπὶ μητρί, καὶ ἐπὶ υἱοῖς, καὶ ἐπὶ θυγατρά-

### Leviticus Chapter 20

<sup>18</sup> They shall bear their iniquity. And if a man shall lie with a woman set apart in her time of impurity, and shall uncover her nakedness, he hath uncovered her fountain, and she hath uncovered the flow of her blood: they shall be cut off, both of them, from among their people.
<sup>19</sup> And the nakedness of thy father's sister, and of thy mother's sister, shalt thou not uncover; for he hath uncovered his kinship; they shall bear their sin.
<sup>20</sup> And if a man shall lie with his kinswoman, he hath uncovered the nakedness of his kindred; they shall bear their sin, and childless shall they die.
<sup>21</sup> And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is an impurity; he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness: childless shall they die.
<sup>22</sup> And ye shall keep all My commandments, and all My judgments, to do them; and the land, into which I bring you there to dwell upon it, shall not spue you out.
<sup>23</sup> And ye shall not walk in the statutes of the nations, whom I will cast out from before you; for all these things have they done, and I have abhorred them.
<sup>24</sup> And I said unto you: Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you for a possession, a land flowing with milk and honey; I am the Lord your God, who hath separated you from all peoples.
<sup>25</sup> And ye shall separate them, [distinguishing] between the clean beasts and between the unclean [beasts], and between the unclean fowls and the clean; and ye shall not make your souls abominable with the beasts, nor with the fowls, nor with all creeping things of the earth, which I have set apart for you as unclean.
<sup>26</sup> And ye shall be holy unto Me, for I am holy, [even] the Lord your God, who hath separated you from all peoples, to be Mine.
<sup>27</sup> And a man or a woman among them who shall become a medium or a sorcerer, they shall surely be put to death, both of them; with stones shall ye stone them: their guilt is upon them.

### Chapter 21

<sup>1</sup> And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying: Speak unto the priests, the sons of Aaron, and thou shalt say unto them: They shall not defile themselves among their people by [contact with] dead persons,
<sup>2</sup> but only for his kindred, that is near unto him:
<sup>3</sup> for his father, and for his mother, and for his sons, and for his daughters, and for his sister, and for his virgin sister that is near unto him, [one] who hath had no husband.
