ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ 41
4 ἐγέννησε τὸν Σαβᾶν, καὶ τὸν Θαιμάν, καὶ τὸν Δαιδάν. Υἱοὶ δὲ
Δαιδὰν ἐγένοντο Ῥαγουήλ, καὶ Ναβεδήλ, καὶ Ἀσσουρίμ, καὶ Λατουσίεμ,
καὶ Λαωμείμ. Υἱοὶ δὲ Μαδιάμ· Γεράρ, καὶ Ἀφέρ, καὶ
Ἑνώχ, καὶ Ἀβειρά, καὶ Θεργαμά· οὗτοι πάντες ἦσαν υἱοὶ Χεττούρας.
5 Ἔδωκε δὲ Ἀβραὰμ πάντα τὰ ὑπάρχοντα αὐτοῦ Ἰσαὰκ τῷ
υἱῷ αὐτοῦ·
6 καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς τῶν παλλακῶν αὐτοῦ ἔδωκεν Ἀβραὰμ
δόματα, καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ Ἰσαὰκ τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ, ἔτι
ζῶντος αὐτοῦ, πρὸς ἀνατολὰς εἰς γῆν ἀνατολῶν.
7 Ταῦτα δὲ τὰ ἔτη
ἡμερῶν ζωῆς Ἀβραὰμ ὅσα ἔζησεν, ἑκατὸν ἑβδομηκονταπέντε ἔτη·
8 καὶ ἐκλείπων ἀπέθανεν Ἀβραὰμ ἐν γήρει καλῷ πρεσβύτης καὶ πλήρης
ἡμερῶν, καὶ προσετέθη πρὸς τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ.
9 Καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν
Ἰσαὰκ καὶ Ἰσμαὴλ οἱ (δύο) υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸ σπήλαιον τὸ
διπλοῦν, εἰς τὸν ἀγρὸν Ἐφρών, τοῦ Σαὰρ τοῦ Χετταίου, ὃ ἐστιν
10 ἀπέναντι Μαμβρῆ, τὸν ἀγρὸν καὶ τὸ σπήλαιον, ὃ ἐκτήσατο Ἀβραὰμ
παρὰ τῶν υἱῶν Χέτ· ἐκεῖ ἔθαψαν Ἀβραὰμ καὶ Σάρραν τὴν
γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ.
11 Ἐγένετο δὲ μετὰ τὸ ἀποθανεῖν Ἀβραάμ, εὐλόγησεν
ὁ Θεὸς τὸν Ἰσαὰκ τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ· καὶ κατῴκησεν Ἰσαὰκ παρὰ
τὸ φρέαρ τῆς δράσεως.
12 Αὗται δὲ αἱ γενέσεις Ἰσμαὴλ τοῦ υἱοῦ
Ἀβραάμ, ὃν ἔτεκεν Ἄγαρ ἡ Αἰγυπτία ἡ παιδίσκη Σάρρας τῷ
Ἀβραάμ·
13 καὶ ταῦτα τὰ ὀνόματα τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσμαήλ, κατ᾿ ὀνόματα
τῶν γενεῶν αὐτοῦ· πρωτότοκος Ἰσμαὴλ Ναβαιώθ, καὶ Κηδάο,
καὶ Ναβεδήλ, καὶ Μασσάμ, καὶ Μασμά, καὶ Ἰδουμά, καὶ Μασ-
14 σῆ, καὶ Χοδδάν, καὶ Θαιμάν, καὶ Ἰετούρ, καὶ Ναφές, καὶ Κεδμά.
15 Οὗτοι εἰσιν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσμαήλ, καὶ ταῦτα τὰ ὀνόματα αὐτῶν ἐν
ταῖς σκηναῖς αὐτῶν καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἐπαύλεσιν αὐτῶν· δώδεκα ἄρχοντες
κατὰ ἔθνη αὐτῶν.
16 Καὶ ταῦτα τὰ ἔτη τῆς ζωῆς Ἰσμαήλ,
ἑκατὸν τριακονταεπτά ἔτη· καὶ ἐκλείπων ἀπέθανε, καὶ προσετέθη
πρὸς τὸ γένος αὐτοῦ.
17 Κατῴκησε δὲ ἀπὸ Εὐειλὰτ ἕως Σούρ, ἥ ἐστι
κατὰ πρόσωπον Αἰγύπτου, ἕως ἐλθεῖν πρὸς Ἀσσυρίους· κατὰ πρόσωπον
πάντων τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτοῦ κατῴκησε.
18 Καὶ αὗται αἱ γενέσεις
Ἰσαάκ, τοῦ υἱοῦ Ἀβραάμ· Ἀβραὰμ ἐγέννησε τὸν Ἰσαάκ.
19 Ἦν δὲ Ἰσαὰκ ἐτῶν τεσσαράκοντα, ὅτε ἔλαβε τὴν Ῥεβέκκαν θυγατέρα
Βαθουὴλ τοῦ Σύρου ἐκ τῆς Μεσοποταμίας Συρίας, ἀδελφὴν
Λάβαν τοῦ Σύρου, ἑαυτῷ εἰς γυναῖκα.
20 Ἐδεῖτο δὲ Ἰσαὰκ
Κυρίου περὶ Ῥεβέκκας τῆς γυναικὸς αὐτοῦ, ὅτι στεῖρα ἦν· ἐπήκουσε
δὲ αὐτοῦ ὁ Θεός, καὶ ἔλαβεν ἐν γαστρί Ῥεβέκκα ἡ γυνή

### CHAPTER XXV.
GENESIS 41
<br/>
4 And he begat Saban, and Thaiman, and Daidan. And the sons of Daidan were Raguel, and Nabedeil, and Assourim, and Latousiem, and Laomeim. And the sons of Madian: Gerar, and Apher, and Enoch, and Abeira, and Thergama. All these were the sons of Chettoura.
<br/>
5 And Abraham gave all his possessions unto Isaac his son;
<br/>
6 and unto the sons of his concubines, Abraham gave gifts, and he sent them away from Isaac his son, while he was yet alive, eastward, unto the land of the East.
<br/>
7 And these are the days of the years of Abraham’s life, which he lived: a hundred seventy and five years.
<br/>
8 And Abraham expired and died in a good old age, an old man full of days, and he was gathered unto his people.
<br/>
9 And Isaac and Ishmael, his [two] sons, buried him in the double cave, in the field of Ephron, the son of Zaar the Hethite, which is
<br/>
10 opposite Mamre; the field and the cave which Abraham purchased from the sons of Heth. There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife.
<br/>
11 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son; and Isaac dwelt by the Well of Vision.
<br/>
12 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s handmaiden, bore unto Abraham.
<br/>
13 And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, according to their names, by their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nabaiōth, and Kēdao, and Nabedēl, and Massam, and Masma, and Idouma, and
<br/>
14 Massē, and Choddan, and Thaiman, and Ietour, and Naphes, and Kedma.
<br/>
15 These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names by their encampments and by their dwellings: twelve chieftains according to their nations.
<br/>
16 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, a hundred thirty and seven years; and he expired and died, and was gathered unto his kindred.
<br/>
17 And he dwelt from Euilat even unto Sour, which is opposite Egypt, as one comes toward the Assyrians; he dwelt in the presence of all his brethren.
<br/>
18 And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham begat Isaac.
<br/>
19 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bathuel the Syrian, from Mesopotamia of Syria, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife.
<br/>
20 And Isaac entreated the Lord for Rebekah his wife, because she was barren; and God heard him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
