20 ἂν κοιτάζηται ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸ ἐν τῇ ἀφέδρῳ αὐτῆς, ἀκάθαρτον ἔσται·
21 καὶ πᾶν ἐφ᾿ ὃ ἂν ἐπικαθίσῃ ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸ, ἀκάθαρτον ἔσται. Καὶ πᾶς ὃς ἐὰν ἅψηται τῆς κοίτης αὐτῆς, πλυνεῖ τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ, καὶ λούσεται τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ ὕδατι, καὶ ἀκάθαρτος ἔσται ἕως ἑσπέρας.
22 καὶ πᾶς ὁ ἁπτόμενος παντὸς σκεύους, οὗ ἐὰν καθίσῃ ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸ, πλυνεῖ τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ, καὶ λούσεται ὕδατι, καὶ ἀκάθαρτος ἔσται
23 ἕως ἑσπέρας· ἐὰν δὲ ἐν τῇ κοίτῃ αὐτῆς οὔσης, ἢ ἐπὶ τοῦ σκεύους, οὗ ἐὰν αὐτὴ κάθηται ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ, ἐν δὲ τῷ ἅπτεσθαι αὐτὸν αὐτῆς, ἀκάθαρτος ἔσται ἕως ἑσπέρας.
24 Ἐὰν δὲ κοίτῃ τις κοιμηθῇ μετ᾿ αὐτῆς, καὶ γένηται ἡ ἀκαθαρσία αὐτῆς ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ, καὶ ἀκάθαρτος ἔσται ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας· καὶ πᾶσα κοίτη ἐφ᾿ ἣν κοιμηθῇ ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς, ἀκάθαρτος ἔσται.
25 Καὶ γυνὴ ἐὰν ῥέῃ ῥύσει αἵματος ἡμέρας πλείους, οὐκ ἐν καιρῷ τῆς ἀφέδρου αὐτῆς, ἐὰν καὶ ῥέῃ μετὰ τὴν ἀφεδρον αὐτῆς, πᾶσαι αἱ ἡμέραι ῥύσεως ἀκαθαρσίας αὐτῆς, καθάπερ αἱ ἡμέραι τῆς ἀφέδρου αὐτῆς, ἀκάθαρτος ἔσται.
26 καὶ πᾶσα κοίτη ἐφ᾿ ἣν ἂν κοιμηθῇ ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς ῥύσεως αὐτῆς, κατὰ τὴν κοίτην τῆς ἀφέδρου αὐτῆς ἔσται αὐτῇ· καὶ πᾶν σκεῦος ἐφ᾿ ὃ ἂν καθίσῃ ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸ, ἀκάθαρτον ἔσται
27 κατὰ τὴν ἀκαθαρσίαν τῆς ἀφέδρου αὐτῆς· πᾶς δ᾿ ἁπτόμενος αὐτῆς, ἀκάθαρτος ἔσται, καὶ πλυνεῖ τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ, καὶ λούσεται τὸ
28 σῶμα ὕδατι, καὶ ἀκάθαρτος ἔσται ἕως ἑσπέρας. Ἐὰν δὲ καθαρισθῇ ἀπὸ τῆς ῥύσεως αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐξαριθμήσεται αὐτὴ ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας,
29 καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα καθαρισθήσεται. Καὶ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ὀγδόῃ λήψεται αὐτῇ δύο τρυγόνας, ἢ δύο νεοσσοὺς περιστερῶν, καὶ οἴσει αὐτὰ
30 πρὸς τὸν ἱερέα ἐπὶ τὴν θύραν τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου. Καὶ ποιήσει ὁ ἱερεὺς τὴν μίαν περὶ ἁμαρτίας, καὶ τὴν μίαν εἰς ὁλοκαύτωμα· καὶ ἐξιλάσεται περὶ αὐτῆς ὁ ἱερεὺς ἔναντι Κυρίου ἀπὸ
31 ῥύσεως ἀκαθαρσίας αὐτῆς. Καὶ εὐλαβεῖς ποιήσετε τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ ἀπὸ τῶν ἀκαθαρσιῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ οὐκ ἀποθανοῦνται διὰ τὴν ἀκαθαρσίαν αὐτῶν, ἐν τῷ μιαίνειν αὐτοὺς τὴν σκηνήν μου τὴν ἐν
32 αὐτοῖς. Οὗτος ὁ νόμος τοῦ γονοῤῥοοῦς, καὶ ἐάν τινι ἐξέλθῃ ἐξ
33 αὐτοῦ κοίτη σπέρματος, ὥστε μιανθῆναι ἐν αὐτῇ, καὶ τῇ αἱμοῤῥοούσῃ ἐν τῇ ἀφέδρῳ αὐτῆς, καὶ ὁ γονοῤῥύης ἐν τῇ ῥύσει αὐτοῦ, τῷ ἄρσενι ἢ τῇ θηλείᾳ, καὶ (ἐν) τῷ ἀνδρὶ, ὃς ἂν κοιμηθῇ μετὰ ἀποκαθημένης.

20 if he lie upon it in her monthly discharge, it shall be unclean.

21 And every thing whereon he sitteth upon it shall be unclean. And whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his garments, and bathe his body in water, and be unclean until the evening.

22 And whosoever toucheth any vessel whereon she hath sat upon it shall wash his garments, and bathe [himself] in water, and be unclean

23 until the evening. And if, while she is in her bed, or upon any vessel whereon she sitteth upon it, a man touch her, he shall be unclean until the evening.

24 And if a man lie with her in bed, and her uncleanness come upon him, then shall he be unclean seven days; and every bed whereon he lieth upon it shall be unclean.

25 And if a woman have a flow of blood many days, not in the time of her monthly discharge; or if she flow after her monthly discharge, all the days of her unclean flow shall be as the days of her monthly discharge: she shall be unclean.

26 And every bed whereon she lieth upon it all the days of her flow shall be unto her as the bed of her monthly discharge; and every vessel whereon she sitteth upon it shall be unclean,

27 according to the uncleanness of her monthly discharge. And whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean, and shall wash his garments, and bathe his

28 body in water, and be unclean until the evening. But if she be cleansed from her flow, then shall she number for herself seven days,

29 and after these [days] shall she be clean. And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, and bring them

30 unto the priest to the door of the tabernacle of testimony. And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make atonement for her before the Lord for

31 the flow of her uncleanness. Thus shall ye make the children of Israel circumspect regarding their uncleannesses, that they die not because of their uncleanness, when they defile my tabernacle that is among

32 them. This is the law of him that hath a discharge, and of him from whom there goeth forth from

33 him a seminal emission, so that he is defiled thereby; and for her that is afflicted with a flow of blood in her monthly discharge; and for him that hath a discharge, whether he be male or female; and [for] the man who lieth with her that is set apart.
