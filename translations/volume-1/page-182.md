ρεις, ὥστε αἴρειν τοῖς διωστῆρσιν ἐν αὐτοῖς. Καὶ τοὺς διωστῆρας
τῆς κιβωτοῦ καὶ τῆς τραπέζης ἐποίησε, καὶ κατεχρύσωσεν αὐτοὺς
χρυσίῳ καθαρῷ. Καὶ ἐποίησε τὰ σκεύη τῆς τραπέζης, τὰ τρυβλία,
καὶ τὰς θυΐσκας, καὶ τοὺς κυάθους, καὶ τὰ σπονδεῖα, ἐν οἷς σπείσει
ἐν αὐτοῖς χρυσᾶ. Καὶ ἐποίησε τὴν λυχνίαν ἡ φωτίζει, χρυσῆν,
στερεὰν τὸν καυλόν, καὶ τοὺς καλαμίσκους ἐξ ἀμφοτέρων τῶν μερῶν
αὐτῆς· ἐκ τῶν καλαμίσκων αὐτῆς οἱ βλαστοὶ ἐξέχοντες, τρεῖς ἐκ
τούτου, καὶ τρεῖς ἐκ τούτου, ἐξισούμενοι ἀλλήλοις· καὶ τὰ λαμπάδια
αὐτῶν, ἃ ἐστιν ἐπὶ τῶν ἄκρων αὐτῶν, καρυωτὰ ἐξ αὐτῶν· καὶ τὰ
ἀνθέμια αὐτῶν, ἵνα ὦσιν οἱ λύχνοι ἐξ αὐτῶν· καὶ τὸ ἀνθέμιον τὸ
ἕβδομον, τὸ ἐπ’ ἄκρου τοῦ λαμπαδίου, ἐπὶ τῆς κορυφῆς ἄνωθεν,
στερεὸν ὅλον χρυσοῦν· καὶ ἑπτὰ λύχνους αὐτῆς ἐπ’ αὐτῆς χρυσοῦς,
καὶ τὰς λαβίδας αὐτῆς χρυσᾶς, καὶ τὰς ἐπαρυστρίδας αὐτῆς χρυσᾶς.
Οὗτος περιηργύρωσε τοὺς στύλους, καὶ ἐχώνευσε τοῖς στύλοις
δακτυλίους χρυσοῦς, καὶ ἐχρύσωσε τοὺς μοχλεῖς χρυσίῳ· καὶ
κατεχρύσωσε τοὺς στύλους τοῦ καταπετάσματος χρυσίῳ· καὶ
ἐποίησε τὰς ἀγκύλας χρυσᾶς. Οὗτος ἐποίησε τοὺς στύλους τῆς
σκηνῆς χρυσοῦς, καὶ τοὺς κρίκους τῆς αὐλῆς, καὶ κρίκους εἰς τὸ
ἐκτείνειν ἄνωθεν τὸ κατακάλυμμα χαλκοῦς. Οὗτος ἐχώνευσε τὰς
κεφαλίδας τὰς ἀργυρᾶς τοῖς στύλοις, καὶ τὰς κεφαλίδας τὰς χαλκᾶς
τῆς θύρας τῆς σκηνῆς, καὶ τῇ πύλῃ τῆς αὐλῆς, καὶ ἀγκύλας
ἐποίησεν ἀργυρᾶς ἐπὶ τῶν στύλων· οὗτος περιηργύρωσεν αὐτοῖς.
Οὗτος ἐποίησε τοὺς πασσάλους τῆς σκηνῆς, καὶ τοὺς πασσάλους
τῆς αὐλῆς χαλκοῦς. Οὗτος ἐποίησε τὸ θυσιαστήριον χαλκοῦν ἐκ
τῶν πυρίων τῶν χαλκῶν, ἃ ἦν τοῖς ἀνδράσι τοῖς καταστασιάσασι
μετὰ τῆς Κορὲ συναγωγῆς. Οὗτος ἐποίησε πάντα τὰ σκεύη τοῦ
θυσιαστηρίου, καὶ τὴν βάσιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὸ πυρεῖον αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰς
φιάλας, καὶ τὰς κρεάγρας χαλκᾶς. Οὗτος ἐποίησε τῷ θυσιαστηρίῳ
περίθεμα, ἔργον δικτυωτόν, κάτωθεν τοῦ πυρείου εἰς αὐτὸ ἕως τοῦ
ἡμίσους αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐπέθηκεν αὐτῷ τέσσαρας δακτυλίους ἐκ τῶν
τεσσάρων μερῶν τοῦ παραθέματος τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου χαλκοῦς,
εὑρεῖς τοῖς μοχλοῖς, ὥστε αἴρειν τὸ θυσιαστήριον ἐν αὐτοῖς.
Οὗτος ἐποίησε τὸ ἔλαιον τοῦ χρίσματος τὸ ἅγιον, καὶ τὴν σύνθεσιν
τοῦ θυμιάματος, καθαρὸν ἔργον μυρεψοῦ. Οὗτος ἐποίησε τὸν
λουτῆρα τὸν χαλκοῦν, καὶ τὴν βάσιν αὐτοῦ χαλκῆν ἐκ τῶν
κατόπτρων τῶν νηστευσασῶν, αἳ ἐνήστευσαν παρὰ τὰς θύρας τῆς
σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου, ἐν ᾗ ἡμέρᾳ ἔπηξεν αὐτήν·

### Exodus 38

...[the] poles, so that they might bear [it] with the staves through them. And he did make the staves of the ark and of the table, and did overlay them with pure gold.

And he did make the vessels of the table: the dishes, and the cups, and the bowls, and the libation-bowls, wherein he should pour out [offerings] with them, of gold.

And he did make the lampstand, which giveth light, of solid gold, with its shaft firm, and its branches [extending] from both of its sides; out of its branches, the blossoms were forth-issuing, three from this side, and three from that side, matching one another. And their lamps, which were upon their ends, were fashioned [like] almonds from them; and their blossoms, that the lamps might proceed from them. And the seventh blossom, which was upon the top of the lampstand, above on its peak, was wholly of solid gold. And its seven lamps upon it were of gold, and its snuffers were of gold, and its snuff-dishes were of gold.

He did overlay the pillars with silver, and did cast for the pillars rings of gold, and did overlay the bars with gold. And he did overlay the pillars of the veil with gold, and did make the hooks of gold. He did make the pillars of the tent of gold, and the rings of the court, and rings for the stretching out of the covering from above, of bronze.

He did cast the silver capitals for the pillars, and the bronze capitals for the door of the tent and for the gate of the court; and he did make silver hooks for the pillars; and he did overlay them with silver. He did make the pegs of the tent, and the pegs of the court, of bronze.

He did make the bronze altar from the bronze censers, which belonged unto the men who rebelled with the congregation of Korah. He did make all the vessels of the altar, and its base, and its fire-pan, and the bowls, and the flesh-hooks, of bronze. He did make for the altar a grating, a work of network, [extending] from beneath the fire-pan unto it, even unto the half thereof; and he did set upon it four rings of bronze on the four sides of the grating of the altar, broad for the poles, so that they might bear the altar with them.

He did make the holy anointing oil, and the pure composition of the incense, the work of a perfumer. He did make the bronze laver, and its bronze base, from the mirrors of the women who fasted, who kept vigil by the doors of the tent of testimony, on the day when he set it up;
