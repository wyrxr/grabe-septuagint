ΚΕΦ. Ε΄.
           μένη ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ προσελθὼν αὐτῷ Ἰησοῦς, εἶπεν αὐτῷ·
14 ἡμέτερος εἶ, ἢ τῶν ὑπεναντίων ἡμῶν; Ὁ δὲ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· ὅτι
           ἐγὼ ἀρχιστράτηγος δυνάμεως Κυρίου, νυνὶ παραγέγονα. Καὶ Ἰη-
           σοῦς ἔπεσεν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, καὶ προσεκύνη-
           σε καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· τί δέσποτά μου, τί προστάσσεις τῷ σῷ οἰ-
           κέτῃ;
15 Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ ἀρχιστράτηγος Κυρίου πρὸς Ἰησοῦν· λῦσον τὸ
           ὑπόδημά σου ἐκ τῶν ποδῶν σου, ὁ γὰρ τόπος ἐφ᾿ ᾧ σὺ ἕστηκας
           ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῦ, ἅγιός ἐστι. Καὶ ἐποίησεν Ἰησοῦς οὕτως.
16 Καὶ Ἱεριχὼ συγκεκλεισμένη καὶ ὠχυρωμένη ἀπὸ προσώπου υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ· καὶ
           οὐδεὶς ἐξεπορεύετο ἐξ αὐτῆς, οὐδὲ εἰσεπορεύετο.

ΚΕΦ. ς΄. VI.

1 ΚΑΙ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Ἰησοῦν· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ παραδίδωμι ὑποχεί-
           ριόν σου τὴν Ἰεριχὼ καὶ τὸν βασιλέα αὐτῆς τὸν ἐν αὐτῇ, δυνα-
           τοὺς ἐν ἰσχύϊ·
2 σὺ δὲ περίστησον αὐτῇ πάντας τοὺς μαχητὰς κύκλω
           τῆς πόλεως ἅπαξ· οὕτω ποιήσετε ἓξ ἡμέρας.
3 Καὶ ἑπτὰ ἱερεῖς λή-
           ψονται ἑπτὰ κερατίνας τοῦ Ἰωβὴλ ἐνώπιον τῆς κιβωτοῦ· καὶ τῇ
           ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ κυκλώσετε τὴν πόλιν ἑπτάκις, καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς σαλ-
           πίσουσιν ἐν ταῖς κερατίναις.
4 Καὶ ἔσται ὡς ἂν σαλπίσητε τῇ σάλ-
           πιγγι τοῦ Ἰωβὴλ, ἐν τῷ ἀκοῦσαι ὑμᾶς τὴν φωνὴν τῆς κερατίνης,
           ἀνακραγέτω πᾶς ὁ λαός· καὶ ἀνακραγόντων αὐτῶν, πεσεῖται αὐτό-
           ματα τὰ τείχη τῆς πόλεως ὑποκάτω αὐτῶν, καὶ εἰσελεύσεται πᾶς
           ὁ λαὸς ὁρμήσας ἕκαστος εἰς τὴν πόλιν κατὰ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ.
5 Καὶ εἰσῆλθεν Ἰησοῦς υἱὸς Ναυῆ πρὸς τοὺς ἱερεῖς, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς
           αὐτούς· λάβετε τὴν κιβωτὸν τῆς διαθήκης, καὶ ἑπτὰ ἱερεῖς λήψον-
           ται ἑπτὰ κερατίνας τοῦ Ἰωβὴλ κατὰ πρόσωπον κιβωτοῦ Κυρίου.
6 Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς λέγων· παραγγείλατε τῷ λαῷ περιελθεῖν καὶ
           κυκλῶσαι τὴν πόλιν, καὶ οἱ μάχιμοι παραπορευέσθωσαν ἐνωπλι-
           σμένοι ἔναντι τῆς κιβωτοῦ τοῦ Κυρίου.
7 Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς εἶπεν Ἰη-
           σοῦς πρὸς τὸν λαὸν, καὶ ἑπτὰ ἱερεῖς ἔχοντες ἑπτὰ σάλπιγγας
           ἱερὰς, παρελθάτωσαν ὡσαύτως ἐναντίον τοῦ Κυρίου, καὶ σημαινέ-
           τωσαν εὐτόνως· καὶ ἡ κιβωτὸς τῆς διαθήκης Κυρίου ἐπακολουθείτω
           αὐτοῖς.
8 Οἱ δὲ μάχιμοι παραπορευέσθωσαν ἔμπροσθεν, καὶ οἱ ἱε-
           ρεῖς σαλπίζοντες ταῖς κερατίναις, καὶ οἱ οὐραγοῦντες ὀπίσω τῆς κι-
           βωτοῦ τῆς διαθήκης Κυρίου, πορευόμενοι καὶ σαλπίζοντες ταῖς
           κερατίναις.

**Joshua 5**
13 drawn in his hand. And Joshua went unto him, and said unto him,
14 "Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?" And he said unto him, "Nay; for as Captain of the Lord's host am I now come." And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and worshipped, and said unto him, "What, my Lord, what commandest thou thy servant?"
15 And the Captain of the Lord said unto Joshua, "Loose thy shoe from off thy foot, for the place whereon thou standest, upon it is holy ground." And Joshua did so.
16 Now Jericho was straitly shut up and strongly fortified because of the children of Israel; none went out, and none came in.

**Joshua 6**
1 And the Lord said unto Joshua, "Behold, I have given into thine hand Jericho, and the king thereof, who is therein, and the mighty men of strength.
2 And thou shalt encompass the city with all the men of war, round about the city once; thus shalt thou do for six days.
3 And seven priests shall take seven ram's horns of jubilee before the ark; and on the seventh day ye shall encompass the city seven times, and the priests shall sound with the ram's horns.
4 And it shall come to pass, when ye sound with the trumpet of jubilee, when ye hear the voice of the ram's horn, that all the people shall shout aloud; and when they shout, the walls of the city shall fall down of themselves beneath them; and all the people shall enter, each one rushing into the city straight before him."
5 And Joshua the son of Nun came unto the priests, and said unto them, "Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests take seven ram's horns of jubilee before the ark of the Lord."
6 And he said unto them, saying, "Command the people to go round about and encompass the city; and let the men of war pass on, armed, before the ark of the Lord."
7 And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the seven priests, having seven holy trumpets, went forth likewise before the Lord, and sounded with might; and the ark of the covenant of the Lord followed after them.
8 And the men of war went on before, and the priests sounded with the ram's horns; and the rear guard went behind the ark of the covenant of the Lord, marching and sounding with the ram's horns.
