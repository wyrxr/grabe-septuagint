15 ρὰν ταύτην, ἀλλὰ καὶ τοῖς ὧδε οὖσι σήμερον μεθ᾿ ἡμῶν, ἑστῶ-
   σιν ἔναντι Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν, καὶ τοῖς μὴ οὖσι μεθ᾿ ἡμῶν ὧ-
16 δε σήμερον (ἔναντι Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ὑμῶν)· (ὅτι ὑμεῖς οἴδατε ὡς
   κατῳκήσαμεν ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ, καὶ ὡς παρήλθομεν ἐν μέσῳ τῶν
17 ἐθνῶν οὓς παρήλθετε· καὶ ἴδετε τὰ ἐδελύγματα αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰ εἴ-
   δωλα αὐτῶν, ξύλον καὶ λίθον, ἀργύριον καὶ χρυσίον, ἃ ἔστι παρ᾿
18 αὐτοῖς)· μή τις ἔστιν ἐν ὑμῖν ἀνὴρ ἢ γυνή, ἢ πατριά, ἢ φυλή,
   τινὸς ἡ διάνοια αὐτοῦ ἐξέκλινε σήμερον ἀπὸ Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ
   ἡμῶν, πορεύεσθαι λατρεύειν τοῖς Θεοῖς τῶν ἐθνῶν ἐκείνων· μή-
   τις ἔστιν ἐν ὑμῖν ῥίζα (πικρίας) ἄνω φύουσα ἐν χολῇ καὶ πικρίᾳ.
19 καὶ ἔσται ἐὰν ἀκούσῃ τὰ ῥήματα τῆς ἀρᾶς ταύτης, καὶ ἐπισημή-
   σηται ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ, λέγων· ὅσιά μοι γένοιτο, ὅτι ἐν τῇ
   ἀποπλανήσει τῆς καρδίας μου πορεύσομαι· ἵνα μὴ συναπολέσῃ ὁ
20 ἁμαρτωλὸς τὸν ἀναμάρτητον. Οὐ μὴ θελήσει ὁ Θεὸς εὐιλατεύ-
   ειν αὐτῷ, ἀλλ᾿ ἡ τότε ἐκχυθήσεται ὀργὴ Κυρίου καὶ ὁ ζῆλος
   αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ ἐκείνῳ, καὶ κολληθήσονται ἐν αὐτῷ πᾶσαι
   αἱ ἀραὶ τῆς διαθήκης ταύτης, αἱ γεγραμμέναι ἐν τῷ βιβλίῳ τοῦ
   νόμου τούτῳ· καὶ ἐξαλείψει Κύριος τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ ἐκ τῆς ὑπὸ
21 τὸν οὐρανόν, καὶ διαστελεῖ αὐτὸν Κύριος εἰς κακὰ ἐκ πάντων τῶν
   υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, κατὰ πάσας τὰς ἀρὰς τῆς διαθήκης τῆς γεγραμ-
22 μένης ἐν τῷ βιβλίῳ τοῦ νόμου τούτου. Καὶ ἐροῦσιν ἡ γενεὰ ἡ
   ἑτέρα, οἱ υἱοὶ ὑμῶν οἱ ἀναστήσονται μεθ᾿ ὑμᾶς, καὶ ὁ ἀλλότριος
   ὃς ἂν ἔλθῃ ἐκ γῆς μακρόθεν, καὶ ὄψονται τὰς πληγὰς τῆς γῆς
   ἐκείνης καὶ τὰς νόσους αὐτῆς, ἃς ἀπέστειλε Κύριος ἐπ᾿ αὐτὴν,
23 θεῖον καὶ ἅλα κατακεκαυμένον· πᾶσα ἡ γῆ αὐτῆς οὐ σπαρήσεται,
   οὐδὲ ἀνατελεῖ, οὐδὲ μὴ ἀναβῇ ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς πᾶν χλωρόν· ὥσπερ κα-
   τεστράφη Σόδομα καὶ Γόμορρα, Ἀδαμὰ καὶ Σεβωὶμ, ἃς κατέ-
24 στρεψε Κύριος ἐν θυμῷ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐν ὀργῇ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐροῦσι πάντα τὰ
   ἔθνη· διατί ἐποίησεν οὕτως Κύριος τῇ γῇ ταύτῃ; τίς ὁ θυμὸς τῆς ὀργῆς ὁ
25 μέγας οὗτος; Καὶ ἐροῦσιν· ὅτι κατέλιπον τὴν διαθήκην Κυρίου τοῦ
   Θεοῦ τῶν πατέρων αὐτῶν, ἃ διέθετο τοῖς πατράσιν αὐτῶν, ὅτε
26 ἐξήγαγεν αὐτοὺς ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, καὶ πορευθέντες ἐλάτρευσαν
   θεοῖς ἑτέροις, καὶ προσεκύνησαν αὐτοῖς, θεοῖς οἷς οὐκ ἠπίστατο
27 οὐδὲ διένειμεν αὐτοῖς· καὶ ὠργίσθη Κύριος θυμῷ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν
   ἐκείνην, ἐπαγαγεῖν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὴν κατὰ πάσας τὰς ἀρὰς (τῆς διαθή-
28 κης) τὰς γεγραμμένας ἐν τῷ βιβλίῳ τοῦ νόμου τούτῳ· καὶ ἐξῆρεν

**Deuteronomy 29**
15 curse, but also with them that stand here with us this day before the Lord our God, and with them that are not here with us this day (before the Lord your God);
16 (for ye know how we dwelt in the land of Egypt, and how we passed through the midst of the nations whom ye passed through;
17 and ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which are with them;)
18 lest there be among you a man, or a woman, or a family, or a tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the Lord our God, to go and serve the gods of those nations; lest there be among you a root of [bitterness] springing up with gall and bitterness.
19 And it shall be, if he hear the words of this curse, and shall bless himself in his heart, saying, “Peace shall be mine, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart,” that the sinner may not destroy the innocent with himself.
20 The Lord will not be willing to pardon him, but then shall the wrath of the Lord and His jealousy be poured out upon that man; and all the curses of this covenant, which are written in this book of the law, shall cleave unto him; and the Lord shall blot out his name from under heaven.
21 And the Lord shall separate him unto evil from among all the sons of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant which are written in this book of the law.
22 And the generation that cometh after, even your sons who shall rise up after you, and the stranger that shall come from a far land, shall see the plagues of that land and its diseases, which the Lord hath sent upon it:
23 Sulphur and salt, burnt up; all her land shall not be sown, neither shall it spring forth, neither shall any green thing grow upon it; as Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim were overthrown, which the Lord overthrew in His wrath and in His fury.
24 And all the nations shall say, “Wherefore hath the Lord done thus unto this land? What meaneth the heat of this great wrath?”
25 Then shall they say, “Because they forsook the covenant of the Lord God of their fathers, which He made with their fathers when He brought them forth out of the land of Egypt;
26 and went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods whom they knew not, neither had He apportioned unto them.
27 And the Lord was wroth with great anger against that land, to bring upon it all the curses [of the covenant] which are written in this book of the law;
28 and the Lord rooted them out from their land in wrath, and in anger, and in great indignation, and cast them out into another land, as it is this day.”
