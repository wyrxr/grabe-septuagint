**30.** Καὶ ἔταξαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς τὸν Βενιαμεὶν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τρίτῃ· καὶ παρετάξαντο πρὸς Γαβαὰδ καθὼς ἅπαξ καὶ ἅπαξ.
**31.** Καὶ ἐξῆλθον οἱ υἱοὶ Βενιαμεὶν εἰς ἀπάντησιν τοῦ λαοῦ, καὶ ἐξειλκύσθησαν ἐκ τῆς πόλεως· καὶ ἤρξαντο τύπτειν ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ τραυματίας καθὼς ἅπαξ καὶ ἅπαξ ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς, ἥ ἐστι μία ἀναβαίνουσα εἰς Βαιθήλ, καὶ μία ἀναβαίνουσα εἰς Γαβαὰδ ἐν τῷ ἀγρῷ, ὡσεὶ τριάκοντα ἄνδρας ἐν τῷ Ἰσραήλ.
**32.** Καὶ εἶπαν οἱ υἱοὶ Βενιαμείν· προσκόπτουσιν ἐνώπιον ἡμῶν καθὼς ἔμπροσθεν. Καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ εἶπαν· φεύγωμεν καὶ ἐκσπάσωμεν αὐτοὺς ἐκ τῆς πόλεως εἰς τὰς ὁδούς.
**33.** Καὶ πᾶς ἀνὴρ Ἰσραὴλ ἀνέστη ἐκ τοῦ τόπου αὑτοῦ, καὶ παρετάξαντο ἐν Βάαλ Θαμάρ· καὶ τὸ ἔνεδρον Ἰσραὴλ ἐπάλαιεν ἐκ τοῦ τόπου αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ δυσμῶν τῆς Γαβαάδ.
**34.** Καὶ παρεγένοντο ἐξεναντίας τῆς Γαβαὰδ δέκα χιλιάδες ἀνδρῶν ἐκλεκτῶν ἐκ παντὸς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ὁ πόλεμος ἐβαρύνθη· καὶ αὐτοὶ οὐκ ἔγνωσαν ὅτι ἀφῆπται αὐτῶν ἡ κακία.
**35.** Καὶ ἐτρόπωσε Κύριος τὸν Βενιαμεὶν κατὰ πρόσωπον Ἰσραήλ, καὶ διέφθειραν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τῷ Βενιαμεὶν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ εἴκοσι καὶ πέντε χιλιάδας καὶ ἑκατὸν ἄνδρας· πάντες οὗτοι σπώμενοι ῥομφαίαν.
**36.** Καὶ εἶδε Βενιαμεὶν ὅτι τετρόπωται, καὶ ἔδωκεν ἀνὴρ Ἰσραὴλ τῷ Βενιαμεὶν τόπον, ὅτι ἤλπισαν ἐπὶ τὸ ἔνεδρον ὃ ἔταξαν πρὸς τὴν Γαβαάδ.
**37.** Καὶ τὸ ἔνεδρον ὥρμησε, καὶ ἐξεχύθησαν πρὸς τὴν Γαβαὰδ καὶ ἐπορεύθη τὸ ἔνεδρον καὶ ἐπάταξαν ὅλην τὴν πόλιν ἐν στόματι ῥομφαίας.
**38.** Καὶ ἡ συνταγὴ ἦν ἀνδρὶ Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς τὸ ἔνεδρον μάχαιραν, τοῦ ἀνενέγκαι αὐτοὺς πυρσὸν τοῦ καπνοῦ τῆς πόλεως.
**39.** Καὶ ἀνέστρεψεν ἀνὴρ Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ, καὶ Βενιαμεὶν ἤρξαται τοῦ τύπτειν τραυματίας ἐν τῷ ἀνδρὶ Ἰσραὴλ ὡσεὶ τριάκοντα ἄνδρας, ὅτι εἶπαν· πλὴν τροπούμενος τροποῦται αὐτὸς ἐναντίον ἡμῶν, καθὼς ὁ πόλεμος ἔμπροσθεν.
**40.** Καὶ ὁ πυρσὸς ἤρξατο ἀναβαίνειν ἐκ τῆς πόλεως, στῦλος καπνοῦ· καὶ ἐπέβλεψε Βενιαμὶν ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἀνέβη συντέλεια τῆς πόλεως εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν.
**41.** Καὶ ἀνὴρ Ἰσραὴλ ἀπέστρεψε· καὶ ἔσπευσεν ἀνὴρ Βενιαμείν, καὶ ἴδεν ἔτι ἧπται αὐτοῦ ἡ κακία.
**42.** Καὶ ἔκλιναν ἐνώπιον ἀνδρὸς Ἰσραὴλ εἰς τὴν ὁδὸν τῆς ἐρήμου· καὶ ὁ πόλεμος κατέφθασεν αὐτόν, καὶ οἱ ἀπὸ τῶν πόλεων διέφθειραν αὐτὸν ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῶν.
**43.** Καὶ ἔκοψαν τὸν Βενιαμεὶν καταπαῦσαι αὐτὸν κατάπαυσιν, καὶ κατεπάτησαν αὐτὸν ἕως ἐξεναντίας τῆς Γαβαὰδ ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν ἡλίου.
**44.** Καὶ ἔπεσαν ἐκ τοῦ Βενιαμεὶν ὀκτωκαίδεκα χιλιάδες ἀνδρῶν, σὺν πᾶσι τούτοις ἄνδρες δυνατοί.

### Judges Chapter 20

**30.** And the children of Israel set themselves in array against Benjamin on the third day; and they arrayed themselves against Gibeah, as at the first and at the second time.
**31.** And the children of Benjamin came forth to meet the people, and were drawn out of the city; and they began to smite of the people, [even] wounded men, as at the first and at the second time, on the roads; one of which goeth up to Bethel, and one goeth up to Gibeah in the field, [and they smote] about thirty men of Israel.
**32.** And the children of Benjamin said, "They are smitten before us, as aforetime." But the children of Israel said, "Let us flee, and draw them out of the city unto the roads."
**33.** And all the men of Israel rose up from their place, and arrayed themselves in Baal Thamar; and the ambush of Israel struggled forth from its place, from the west of Gibeah.
**34.** And there came forth from over against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle pressed hard; but they knew not that their mischief was come upon them.
**35.** And the Lord routed Benjamin before the face of Israel, and the children of Israel slew of Benjamin on that day five and twenty thousand and one hundred men; all these drawing sword.
**36.** And when Benjamin saw that they were routed, the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin, for they trusted in the ambush which they had set against Gibeah.
**37.** And the ambush rushed forth, and poured out upon Gibeah; and the ambush went and smote all the city with the edge of the sword.
**38.** And the token was for the men of Israel to the ambush, [even] a sword, that they should cause them to raise up a pillar of smoke from the city.
**39.** And the men of Israel turned back in the battle, and Benjamin had begun to smite wounded men among the men of Israel, about thirty men, for they said, "Surely he turneth himself to flight before us, being utterly routed, as the battle was aforetime."
**40.** And the torch began to ascend out of the city, [even] a pillar of smoke; and Benjamin looked behind him, and, behold, the full destruction of the city went up unto heaven.
**41.** And the men of Israel turned back; and the men of Benjamin made haste, and saw that their mischief was come upon them.
**42.** And they turned [their backs] before the men of Israel, unto the way of the wilderness; and the battle overtook them, and those from the cities slew them in their midst.
**43.** And they cut down Benjamin, to cause him to cease [from existence], and they trampled him down over against Gibeah, from the rising of the sun.
**44.** And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men, all these being mighty men.
