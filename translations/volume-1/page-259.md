20 τὸ ξυρήσασθαι αὐτὸν τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ, καὶ προσοίσει αὐτὰ ὁ ἱερεὺς ἐπίδεμα ἔναντι Κυρίου· ἅγιον ἔσται τῷ ἱερεῖ ἐπὶ τοῦ στηθουνίου τοῦ ἐπιδέματος, καὶ ἐπὶ τοῦ βραχίονος τοῦ ἀφαιρέματος·
21 καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα πίεται ὁ ἡγιασμένος οἶνον. Οὗτος ὁ νόμος τοῦ εὐξαμένου, ὃς ἂν εὔξηται (Κυρίῳ) δῶρον αὐτοῦ Κυρίῳ περὶ τῆς εὐχῆς αὐτοῦ, χωρὶς ὧν ἂν εὕρῃ ἡ χεὶρ αὐτοῦ· κατὰ δύναμιν εὐχῆς αὐτοῦ, ἧς ἂν εὔξηται, οὕτω ποιήσει κατὰ τὸν νόμον ἁγνείας αὐτοῦ.
22 Καὶ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, λέγων· 23 λάλησον ᾿Ααρὼν καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ, λέγων· οὕτως εὐλογήσετε 24 τοὺς υἱοὺς ᾿Ισραήλ, λέγοντες αὐτοῖς· εὐλογήσαι σε Κύριος, καὶ 25 φυλάξαι σε· ἐπιφάναι Κύριος τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ σέ, καὶ 26 ἐλεῆσαι σε· ἐπάραι Κύριος τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ σέ, καὶ δῴη σοι εἰρήνην· 27 καὶ ἐπιθήσουσι τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐπὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς ᾿Ισραήλ, καὶ ἐγὼ Κύριος εὐλογήσω αὐτούς.

ΚΕΦ. Ζ. VII.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ᾗ συνετέλεσε Μωυσῆς, ὥστε ἀναστῆσαι τὴν σκηνήν, καὶ ἔχρισεν αὐτήν, καὶ ἡγίασεν αὐτὴν καὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη αὐτῆς, καὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον καὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ,
2 καὶ ἔχρισεν αὐτά, καὶ ἡγίασεν αὐτά, καὶ προσήνεγκαν οἱ ἄρχοντες ᾿Ισραὴλ δώδεκα, ἄρχοντες οἴκων πατριῶν· (οὗτοι ἄρχοντες φυλῶν, οὗτοι οἱ παραστήκοντες ἐπὶ τῆς ἐπισκοπῆς) καὶ ἤνεγκαν τὰ δῶρα αὐτῶν ἔναντι Κυρίου, ἓξ ἁμάξας λαμπηνίκας, καὶ δώδεκα βόας, ἅμαξαν παρὰ δύο ἀρχόντων, καὶ μόσχον παρὰ ἑκάστου, καὶ προσήνεγκαν
4 αὐτὰ ἐναντίον τῆς σκηνῆς.
5 Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, λέγων· λάβε παρ᾿ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔσονται πρὸς τὰ ἔργα τὰ λειτουργικὰ τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου· καὶ δώσεις αὐτὰ τοῖς Λευίταις, ἑκάστῳ
6 κατὰ τὴν αὐτοῦ λειτουργίαν.
7 Καὶ λαβὼν Μωυσῆς τὰς ἁμάξας καὶ τοὺς βόας, ἔδωκεν αὐτὰ τοῖς Λευίταις. Τὰς δύο ἁμάξας καὶ τοὺς τέσσαρας βόας ἔδωκε τοῖς υἱοῖς Γεδσὼν κατὰ τὰς λειτουργίας αὐτῶν·
8 καὶ τὰς τέσσαρας ἁμάξας καὶ τοὺς ὀκτὼ βόας ἔδωκε τοῖς υἱοῖς Μεραρὶ κατὰ τὰς λειτουργίας αὐτῶν, διὰ ᾿Ιθάμαρ τοῦ
9 υἱοῦ ᾿Ααρὼν τοῦ ἱερέως.
10 Καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς Καὰθ οὐκ ἔδωκεν, ὅτι τὰ λειτουργήματα τοῦ ἁγίου ἔχουσιν· ἐπ᾿ ὤμων ἄρουσι. Καὶ προσήνεγκαν οἱ ἄρχοντες εἰς τὸν ἐγκαινισμὸν τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ᾗ ἔχρισεν αὐτό, καὶ προσήνεγκαν οἱ ἄρχοντες τὰ δῶρα

**Translation:**

**Numbers Chapter 6**

20 the shaving of his head, and the priest shall bring them [forth] as a waved offering before the Lord. Holy shall it be unto the priest upon the breast of the wave offering, and upon the arm of the heave offering.
21 And after these things, he that hath been sanctified shall drink wine. This is the law of the Nazirite, who hath vowed a gift unto the Lord concerning his vow, apart from what his hand may attain; according to the ability of his vow, as he hath vowed, so shall he do, according to the law of his purity.

22 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
23 Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, Thus shall ye bless the children of Israel, saying unto them:
24 May the Lord bless thee, and keep thee;
25 May the Lord make His face to shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee;
26 May the Lord lift up His countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.
27 And they shall put My Name upon the children of Israel, and I, the Lord, shall bless them.

**Chapter 7**

1 And it came to pass on the day when Moses had finished setting up the tabernacle, that he anointed it, and sanctified it, and all its vessels, and the altar with all its vessels.
2 And he anointed them, and sanctified them. And the twelve princes of Israel, the princes of the houses of the fathers—(these were the princes of the tribes, these were they who stood forth for the oversight)—
3 brought their gifts before the Lord: six covered wagons, and twelve oxen; one wagon from every two princes, and a calf from each prince. And they brought
4 them before the tabernacle.
5 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Take [them] from them, and they shall be for the ministering works of the tabernacle of testimony; and thou shalt give them unto the Levites, to each one
6 according to his service.
7 And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and he gave them unto the Levites. The two wagons and the four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon, according to their services;
8 and the four wagons and the eight oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari, according to their services, by the hand of Ithamar the
9 son of Aaron the priest.
10 But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none, for they had the ministrations of the Holy Things; they bore them upon their shoulders. And the princes brought [gifts] for the dedication of the altar on the day when he anointed it, and the princes brought their gifts
