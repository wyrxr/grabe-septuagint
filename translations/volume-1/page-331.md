316 ΔΕΥΤΕΡΟΝΟΜΙΟΝ ΚΕΦ. Δ΄.
17 ὁμοίωμα, πᾶσαν εἰκόνα, ὁμοίωμα ἀρσενικοῦ καὶ θηλυκοῦ, ὁμοίωμα
παντὸς κτήνους τῶν ὄντων ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, ὁμοίωμα παντὸς ὀρνέου
18 πτερωτοῦ, ὃ πέταται ὑπὸ τὸν οὐρανόν, ὁμοίωμα παντὸς ἑρπετοῦ
ὃ ἔρπει ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, ὁμοίωμα παντὸς ἰχθύος, ὅσα ἐστὶν ἐν τοῖς
19 ὕδασιν ὑποκάτω τῆς γῆς· καὶ μὴ ποτε ἀναβλέψας εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν
καὶ ἰδὼν τὸν ἥλιον καὶ τὴν σελήνην καὶ τοὺς ἀστέρας καὶ πάντα
τὸν κόσμον τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, πλανηθεὶς προσκυνήσῃς αὐτοῖς καὶ λα-
τρεύσῃς αὐτοῖς, ἃ ἀπένειμε Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου αὐτὰ πᾶσι τοῖς **ἔ**θνεσιν
τοῖς ὑποκάτω παντὸς τοῦ οὐρανοῦ.
20 Ὑμᾶς δὲ ἔλαβε Κύριος ὁ Θεός, καὶ ἐξήγαγεν ὑμᾶς ἐκ τῆς καμίνου
τῆς σιδηρᾶς, ἐξ Αἰγύπτου, εἶναι αὐτῷ λαὸν ἔγκληρον, ὡς ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ
ταύτῃ.
21 Καὶ Κύριος ἐθυμώθη μοι περὶ τῶν λεγομένων ὑφ᾽ ὑμῶν, καὶ ὤμοσεν
ἵνα μὴ διαβῶ τὸν Ἰορδάνην (τοῦτον), καὶ ἵνα μὴ εἰσέλθω εἰς τὴν
22 γῆν τὴν ἀγαθήν, ἣν Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου δίδωσί σοι ἐν κλήρῳ. Ἐγὼ
γὰρ ἀποθνήσκω ἐν τῇ γῇ ταύτῃ, καὶ οὐ διαβαίνω τὸν Ἰορδάνην
τοῦτον· ὑμεῖς δὲ διαβαίνετε, καὶ κληρονομήσετε τὴν γῆν τὴν ἀγα-
θὴν ταύτην.
23 Προσέχετε ὑμῖν, μή ποτε ἐπιλάθησθε τὴν διαθήκην Κυρίου τοῦ
Θεοῦ ὑμῶν, ἣν διέθετο πρὸς ὑμᾶς, καὶ ποιήσητε ὑμῖν αὐτοῖς γλυπτὸν
ὁμοίωμα πάντων ὧν συνέταξέ σοι Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου·
24 ἔτι Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου πῦρ καταναλίσκον ἐστί, Θεὸς ζηλωτής.
25 Ἐὰν δὲ γεννήσῃς υἱοὺς καὶ υἱοὺς τῶν υἱῶν σου, καὶ χρονίσητε ἐπὶ
τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἀνομήσητε, καὶ ποιήσητε γλυπτὸν ὁμοίωμα παντός,
καὶ ποιήσητε τὸ πονηρὸν ἔναντι Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ὑμῶν,
26 παροργίσαι αὐτόν· διαμαρτύρομαι ὑμῖν σήμερον τόν τε οὐρανὸν
καὶ τὴν γῆν, ὅτι ἀπωλείᾳ ἀπολεῖσθε τάχυ ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς, εἰς ἣν ὑμεῖς
διαβαίνετε τὸν Ἰορδάνην ἔχει, κληρονομήσαι αὐτήν· οὐχὶ πολυγονιεῖτε
27 ἡμέρας ἐπ᾽ αὐτῆς, ἀλλ᾽ ἢ ἐκτριβῇ ἐκτριβήσεσθε. Καὶ διασπερεῖ
Κύριος ὑμᾶς ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς ἔθνεσι, καὶ καταλειφθήσεσθε ὀλίγα ἀριθ-
28 μῷ ἐν (πᾶσι) τοῖς ἔθνεσιν, εἰς οὓς εἰσάξει Κύριος ὑμᾶς ἐκεῖ· καὶ
λατρεύσετε ἐκεῖ θεοῖς ἑτέροις, ἔργοις χειρῶν ἀνθρώπων, ξύλοις καὶ
29 λίθοις, οἳ οὐκ ὄψονται, οὐδὲ μὴ ἀκούσουσιν, οὐδὲ μὴ φάγωσιν,
οὐδὲ μὴ ὀσφρανθῶσι.
30 Καὶ ἐκζητήσετε ἐκεῖ Κύριον τὸν Θεὸν ὑμῶν, καὶ εὑρήσετε αὐτόν,
ὅταν ἐκζητήσητε αὐτὸν ἐξ ὅλης τῆς καρδίας σου, καὶ ἐξ ὅλης τῆς
ψυχῆς σου ἐν τῇ θλίψει σου.
31 Καὶ εὑρήσουσί σε πάντες οἱ λόγοι οὗτοι ἐπ᾽ ἐσχάτου τῶν ἡμερῶν,
καὶ ἐπιστρέψῃς ἐπὶ Κύριον τὸν Θεόν σου, καὶ εἰσακούσῃ τῆς φωνῆς
αὐτοῦ· ὅτι

### DEUTERONOMY CHAPTER 4

17 a likeness, even every image, a likeness of male and female; a likeness
of any beast that is upon the earth; a likeness of any winged fowl,
18 that flieth under the heaven; a likeness of any creeping thing
that creepeth upon the earth; a likeness of any fish, whatsoever is in the
waters beneath the earth.
19 And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou hast seen
the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, thou be
led astray to worship them, and serve them, which the Lord thy God
hath distributed them unto all the nations under all the heaven.
20 But the Lord God took you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace,
out of Egypt, to be unto Him a people of inheritance, as it is this day.
21 And the Lord was wroth with me for your sakes, concerning the words
that you spake, and sware that I should not go over this Jordan, and that I
should not enter into the good land,
22 which the Lord thy God doth give thee for an inheritance. For I must die
in this land, and I shall not go over this Jordan; but ye shall go over, and
ye shall inherit this good land.
23 Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the Lord your God,
which He made with you, and make for yourselves a graven image, a likeness
of all things which the Lord thy God hath commanded thee;
24 for the Lord thy God is a consuming fire, a jealous God.
25 When thou shalt beget sons, and sons' sons, and ye shall have remained
long in the land, and shall commit iniquity, and shall make a graven image,
a likeness of anything, and shall do that which is evil in the sight of the Lord
your God,
26 to provoke Him to anger; I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day,
that ye shall utterly perish quickly from the land, into which ye cross
the Jordan, it possesseth [for you] to inherit it; ye shall not prolong
27 your days upon it, but ye shall utterly be destroyed. And the Lord shall scatter
you among all the nations, and ye shall be left few in number,
28 among [all] the nations, whither the Lord shall lead you; and there ye shall
serve other gods, the work of men's hands, wood and
29 stone, which see not, nor hear, nor eat,
nor smell.
30 But from thence ye shall seek the Lord your God, and ye shall find Him,
when thou shalt seek Him with all thy heart and with all thy soul
in thy tribulation.
31 And all these words shall find thee in the latter days, and thou shalt
turn unto the Lord thy God, and hearken unto His voice; for
