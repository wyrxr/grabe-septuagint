ΚΕΦ. ΛΑ΄.
ἔσται ὑμῖν. Ὅς ἂν ποιήσῃ ὡσαύτως, καὶ ὃς ἂν δῶ ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ 33 ἀλλογενεῖ, ἐξολοθρευθήσεται ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ. 34 Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν· λάβε σεαυτῷ ἡδύσματα, στακτὴν, καὶ ὄνυχα, καὶ χαλβάνην ἡδυσμοῦ, καὶ λίβανον διαφανῆ· 35 ἴσον ἴσῳ ἔσται· καὶ ποιήσουσιν αὐτὸ θυμίαμα μυρεψικόν, ἔργον μυρεψοῦ (μεμιγμένον) συνθέσεως, καθαρὸν ἔργον, ἅγιον. 36 Καὶ συγκύψεις ἐκ τούτων λεπτὸν, καὶ θήσεις ἀπέναντι τῶν μαρτυρίων ἐν τῇ σκηνῇ τοῦ μαρτυρίου, ἔθεν γνωσθήσομαι σοι ἐκεῖθεν· ἅγιον τῶν ἁγίων ἔσται ὑμῖν. 37 Θυμίγμα κατὰ τὴν σύνθεσιν ταύτην οὐ ποιήσετε ὑμῖν ἑαυτοῖς· ἁγίασμα ἔσται ὑμῖν Κυρίῳ· 38 ὅς ἂν ποιήσῃ ὡσαύτως, ὥστε ὀσφράνεσθαι ἐν αὐτῷ, ἀπολεῖται ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. ΛΑ΄. XXXI.

1 Καὶ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, λέγων· 2 ἰδοὺ ἀνακέκλημαι ἐξ ὀνόματος τὸν Βεσελεὴλ τὸν τοῦ Οὐρί, υἱοῦ Ὠρ, τῆς φυλῆς Ἰούδα, 3 καὶ ἐνέπλησα αὐτὸν πνεῦμα θεῖον σοφίας καὶ συνέσεως καὶ ἐπιστήμης καὶ ἐν παντὶ ἔργῳ, 4 διανοεῖσθαι καὶ ἀρχιτεκτονεῖν, ἐργάζεσθαι τὸ χρυσίον, καὶ τὸ ἀργύριον, καὶ τὸν χαλκὸν, καὶ τὴν ὑάκινθον, καὶ τὴν πορφύραν, καὶ τὸ κόκκινον τὸ νηστὸν, καὶ τὴν βύσσον τὴν κεχλωρωμένην, καὶ εἰς τὰ λιθουργικὰ εἰς τὰ ἔργα, 5 καὶ εἰς τὰ τεκτονικὰ τῶν ξύλων, ἐργάζεσθαι κατὰ πάντα τὰ ἔργα. 6 Καὶ ἐγὼ δέδωκα αὐτὸν καὶ τὸν Ἐλιάβ τὸν τοῦ Ἀχισαμάχ ἐκ φυλῆς Δὰν, καὶ παντὶ συνετῷ καρδίᾳ δέδωκα σύνεσιν, καὶ ποιήσουσι πάντα ὅσα συνέταξά σοι, 7 τὴν σκηνὴν τοῦ μαρτυρίου, καὶ τὴν κιβωτὸν τῆς διαθήκης, καὶ τὸ ἱλαστήριον τὸ ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς, καὶ τὴν διασκευὴν τῆς σκηνῆς, καὶ τὰ θυσιαστήρια, 8 καὶ τὴν τράπεζαν καὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη αὐτῆς, καὶ τὴν λυχνίαν τὴν καθαρὰν καὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη αὐτῆς, καὶ τὸν λουτῆρα καὶ τὴν βάσιν αὐτοῦ, 9 καὶ τὰς στολὰς τὰς λειτουργικὰς Ἀαρών, καὶ τὰς στολὰς τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ, 10 εἰς τὸ ἱερατεύειν μοι, καὶ τὸ ἔλαιον τῆς χρίσεως, καὶ τὸ 11 θυμίαμα τῆς συνθέσεως τοῦ ἁγίου· κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἐγὼ ἐντέταλμαι σοι, ποιήσουσι. 12 Καὶ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, λέγων· 13 καὶ σὺ σύνταξον τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραὴλ, λέγων· ὁρᾶτε, καὶ τὰ σάββατά μου φυλάξεσθε· ἔστι γὰρ σημεῖον παρ᾿ ἐμοὶ καὶ ἐν ὑμῖν εἰς τὰς γενεὰς ὑμῶν, ἵνα γνῶτε ὅτι ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ ἁγιάζων ὑμᾶς.

### Exodus

#### Chapter 30 (continued)

shall it be unto you.
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">33</span> Whosoever shall make [it] in like manner, and whosoever shall give thereof unto a stranger, that soul shall be utterly destroyed from among his people.

<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">34</span> Then spake the Lord unto Moses, saying:
Take thou unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum of sweet savor, and frankincense of clear purity:
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">35</span> equal in weight shall they be. And thou shalt make thereof a spiced incense, the work of a perfumer, [a] compound [mixture], a pure work, holy.
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">36</span> And thou shalt compound of these [materials] finely, and thou shalt place it over against the testimonies in the tabernacle of the testimony; from whence I shall make Myself known unto thee from thence. It shall be unto you a Holy of Holies.
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">37</span> A mixture of incense, according to this composition, ye shall not make unto yourselves; it shall be holy unto you for the Lord.
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">38</span> Whosoever shall make [it] in like manner, that he may smell of it, shall be destroyed from among his people.

#### Chapter 31

<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">1</span> And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying:
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">2</span> Behold, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah;
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">3</span> And I have filled him with the divine Spirit of wisdom, and of understanding, and of knowledge, and in every work,
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">4</span> to devise and to make cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in hyacinth, and in purple, and in scarlet, the spun, and in fine linen, the bleached; and for the stonework for the works,
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">5</span> and for the carpentry of woods, to work in all manner of works.
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">6</span> And I have given him, and Eliab the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and unto every wise-hearted man have I given understanding, and they shall make all things whatsoever I have commanded thee:
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">7</span> the tabernacle of the testimony, and the ark of the covenant, and the mercy seat that is upon it, and the equipment of the tabernacle, and the altars,
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">8</span> and the table and all its vessels, and the pure lampstand and all its vessels, and the laver and its base,
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">9</span> and the holy garments for Aaron, and the garments of his sons,
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">10</span> for them to minister unto Me in the priest's office, and the oil of anointing, and the
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">11</span> incense of the holy composition. According to all things whatsoever I have commanded thee, so shall they do.

<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">12</span> And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying:
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">13</span> And do thou command the children of Israel, saying: See ye, and keep My Sabbaths; for it is a sign betwixt Me and you throughout your generations, that ye may know that I am the Lord who doth sanctify you.
