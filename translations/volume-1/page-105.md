**Original Text with light OCR corrections:**
27 ῥέων μόνων οὐκ ἦν τῷ Φαραώ. Κατώκησε δὲ Ἰσραὴλ ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ ἐπὶ γῆς Γεσέν· καὶ ἐκληρονόμησαν ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς, καὶ ηὐξήθησαν 28 καὶ ἐπληθύνθησαν σφόδρα. Ἐπέζησε δὲ Ἰακὼβ ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ δεκαεπτὰ ἔτη· καὶ ἐγένοντο αἱ ἡμέραι Ἰακὼβ ἐνιαυτῶν τῆς ζωῆς 29 αὐτοῦ, ἑκατὸν τεσσαρακονταεπτὰ ἔτη. Ἤγγισαν δὲ αἱ ἡμέραι Ἰσραὴλ τοῦ ἀποθανεῖν· καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ Ἰωσήφ, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· εἰ εὕρηκα χάριν ἐναντίον σου, ὑπόθες τὴν χεῖρά σου ὑπὸ τὸν μηρόν μου, καὶ ποιήσεις ἐπ᾿ ἐμὲ ἐλεημοσύνην καὶ ἀλήθειαν, 30 τοῦ μὴ θάψαι με ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ· ἀλλὰ κοιμηθήσομαι μετὰ τῶν πατέρων μου, καὶ ἀρεῖς με ἐξ Αἰγύπτου, καὶ θάψεις με ἐν τῷ 31 τάφῳ αὐτῶν. Ὁ δὲ εἶπεν· ἐγὼ ποιήσω κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμά σου. Εἶπε δὲ ὄμοσόν μοι· καὶ ὤμοσεν αὐτῷ. Καὶ προσεκύνησεν Ἰσραὴλ ἐπὶ τὸ ἄκρον τῆς ῥάβδου αὐτοῦ.

**ΚΕΦ. ΜΗ΄. XLVIII**

1 Ἐγένετο δὲ μετὰ τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα, καὶ ἀπηγγέλη τῷ Ἰωσήφ, ὅτι ὁ πατήρ σου ἐνοχλεῖται. Καὶ ἀναλαβὼν τοὺς δύο υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, τὸν Μανασσῆ καὶ τὸν Ἐφραΐμ, ἦλθε πρὸς 2 Ἰακώβ. Ἀπηγγέλη δὲ τῷ Ἰακώβ, λέγοντες· Ἰδοὺ ὁ υἱός σου Ἰωσήφ ἔρχεται πρός σε· καὶ ἐνισχύσας Ἰσραήλ, ἐκάθισεν ἐπὶ τὴν 3 κλίνην. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰακὼβ τῷ Ἰωσήφ· ὁ Θεός μου ὤφθη μοι· ἐν 4 γῇ Χαναάν, ἐν Λουζᾷ, καὶ ηὐλόγησέ με, καὶ εἶπέ μοι· Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ αὐξανῶ σε, καὶ πληθυνῶ σε, καὶ ποιήσω σε εἰς συναγωγὰς ἐθνῶν, καὶ δώσω σοι τὴν γῆν ταύτην, καὶ τῷ σπέρματί σου μετὰ σὲ εἰς 5 κατάσχεσιν αἰώνιον. Νῦν οὖν οἱ δύο υἱοί σου, οἱ γενόμενοί σοι ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ πρὸ τοῦ με ἐλθεῖν πρὸς σε εἰς Αἴγυπτον, ἐμοί εἰσιν· Ἐφραΐμ καὶ Μανασσῆ ὡς Ῥουβὴν καὶ (ὡς) Συμεὼν ἔσονταί μοι. 6 Τὰ δὲ ἔκγονα, ἃ ἂν γεννήσῃς μετὰ ταῦτα, σοὶ ἔσονται· ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτῶν κληθήσονται· ἐν τοῖς ἐκείνων κλήροις. 7 Ἐγὼ δὲ ἡνίκα ἠρχόμην ἐκ Μεσοποταμίας τῆς Συρίας, ἀπέθανε Ῥαχὴλ ἡ μήτηρ σου ἐν γῇ Χαναάν, ἐγγίζοντός μου κατὰ τὸν ἱππόδρομον Χαβραθὰ τῆς γῆς, τοῦ ἐλθεῖν Ἐφραθὰ καὶ κατώρυξα αὐτὴν ἔχει ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ τοῦ ἱπποδρόμου· αὕτη ἐστὶ Βηθλεέμ. 8 Ἰδὼν δὲ Ἰσραὴλ τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰωσήφ, εἶπε· τίνες εἰσὶν οὗτοι; Ὁ εἶπε δὲ Ἰωσὴφ τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ· υἱοί μου εἰσίν, οὓς ἔδωκέ μοι ὁ

### GENESIS CHAPTERS XLVII-XLVIII

27 [Of] flowing [things] alone it belonged not to Pharaoh. And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, upon the land of Goshen; and they inherited it, and they increased and multiplied exceedingly.
28 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: and the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were a hundred and forty and seven years.
29 And the days of Israel drew nigh for him to die; and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in your sight, put, I pray you, your hand under my thigh, and you shall do mercy and truth unto me, that you bury me not in Egypt;
30 But I will lie down with my fathers, and you shall carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burial-place.
31 And he said, I will do according to your word. And he said, Swear unto me: and he swore unto him. And Israel worshipped upon the top of his staff.

### CHAPTER XLVIII

1 And it came to pass after these words, that it was told unto Joseph, saying, Your father is ailing. And he took his two sons with him, Manasseh and Ephraim, and came unto Jacob.
2 And it was told unto Jacob, saying, Behold, your son Joseph cometh unto you: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.
3 And Jacob said unto Joseph, My God appeared unto me in the land of Canaan, in Luz, and blessed me, and said unto me,
4 Behold, I will make you fruitful, and multiply you, and I will make of you an assembly of nations, and will give you this land, and to your seed after you for an everlasting possession.
5 Now therefore your two sons, which were born unto you in the land of Egypt before I came unto you into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh shall be unto me as Reuben and [as] Simeon.
6 And your offspring, which you shall beget after these, shall be yours: they shall be called by the name of their brethren in their inheritances.
7 And when I came from Mesopotamia of Syria, Rachel your mother died in the land of Canaan, as I was drawing nigh unto the racecourse, Chabrattha of the land, to come unto Ephratha, and I buried her; she has [it] on the way of the racecourse: this is Bethlehem.
8 And Israel saw Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these? The [one] said, and Joseph unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me here.
