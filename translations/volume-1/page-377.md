56 Καὶ ἡ παλὴ ἐν ὑμῖν καὶ ἡ τρυφερὰ (σφόδρα), ἧς οὐχὶ πεῖραν ἔλαβεν ὁ
ποὺς αὐτῆς βαίνειν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς διὰ τὴν τρυφερότητα καὶ διὰ τὴν
ἀπαλότητα, βασκανεῖ τῷ ὀφθαλμῷ αὐτῆς τὸν ἄνδρα αὐτῆς τὸν ἐν
τῷ κόλπῳ αὐτῆς, καὶ τὸν υἱὸν αὐτῆς καὶ τὴν θυγατέρα αὐτῆς,
57 καὶ τὸ χόριον αὐτῆς τὸ ἐξελθὸν διὰ τῶν μηρῶν αὐτῆς, καὶ τὸ
τέκνον αὐτῆς ὃ ἐὰν τέκῃ· καταφάγεται γὰρ αὐτὰ διὰ τὴν ἔνδειαν
πάντων κρυφῇ ἐν τῇ στενοχωρίᾳ καὶ ἐν τῇ θλίψει, ᾗ ἂν θλίψει σε
58 ὁ ἐχθρός σου ἐν (πάσαις) ταῖς πόλεσί σου, ἐὰν μὴ εἰσακούσητε
ποιεῖν πάντα τὰ ῥήματα τοῦ νόμου τούτου, τὰ γεγραμμένα ἐν τῷ
βιβλίῳ τούτῳ, φοβεῖσθαι τὸ ὄνομα τὸ ἔντιμον καὶ τὸ θαυμαστὸν
59 τοῦτο, Κύριον τὸν Θεόν σου. Καὶ παραδοξάσει Κύριος τὰς πληγὰς
σου καὶ τὰς πληγὰς τοῦ σπέρματός σου, πληγὰς μεγάλας καὶ θαυ-
60 μαστάς, καὶ νόσους πονηρὰς καὶ πιστάς· καὶ ἐπιστρέψει ἐπὶ σὲ
πᾶσαν τὴν ὀδύνην Αἰγύπτου, τὴν πονηράν, ἣν διευλαβεῦ ἀπὸ προ-
61 σώπου αὐτῶν, καὶ κολληθήσονται ἐν σοί· καὶ πᾶσαν μαλακίαν,
καὶ πᾶσαν πληγὴν τὴν μὴ γεγραμμένην (καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν γεγραμ-
μένην) ἐν τῷ βιβλίῳ τοῦ νόμου τούτου, ἐπάξει Κύριος ἐπὶ σέ,
62 ἕως ἂν ἐξολοθρεύσῃ σε· καὶ καταλειφθήσεσθε ἐν ἀριθμῷ βραχεῖ,
ἀνθ’ ὧν ἔτι ἦτε ὡσεὶ τὰ ἄστρα τοῦ οὐρανοῦ τῷ πλήθει, ὅτι οὐκ
63 εἰσηκούσατε τῆς φωνῆς Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ὑμῶν. Καὶ ἔσται ὃν
τρόπον ηὐφράνθη Κύριος ἐφ᾽ ὑμῖν, εὖ ποιῆσαι ὑμᾶς καὶ πληθῦ-
ναι ὑμᾶς, οὕτως εὐφρανθήσεται Κύριος ἐφ᾽ ὑμῖν, ἐξολοθρεῦσαι ὑ-
μᾶς, καὶ τοῦ ἐκτρίψαι ὑμᾶς, καὶ ἐξαρθήσεσθε ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς, εἰς
64 ἣν ὑμεῖς εἰσπορεύεσθε ἐκεῖ, κληρονομῆσαι αὐτήν. Καὶ διασπερεῖ σε
Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου εἰς πάντα τὰ ἔθνη ἀπ’ ἄκρου τῆς γῆς ἕως ἄκρου τῆς
γῆς, καὶ δουλεύσεις ἐκεῖ θεοῖς ἑτέροις, ξύλοις καὶ λίθοις, οἷς οὐκ ἠπί-
65 στω σὺ καὶ οἱ πατέρες σου. Ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν ἐκείνοις οὐκ ἀ-
ναπαύσει σε, οὐδὲ μὴ γένηται στάσις τῷ ἴχνει τοῦ ποδός σου· καὶ
δώσει σοι Κύριος ἐκεῖ καρδίαν ἀθυμοῦσαν, καὶ ἐκλείποντας ὀφθαλ-
66 μούς, καὶ τηκομένην ψυχήν. Καὶ ἔσται ἡ ζωή σου κρεμαμένη σοι
ἀπέναντι τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν σου, καὶ φοβηθήσῃ ἡμέρας καὶ νυκτός,
67 καὶ οὐ πιστεύσεις τῇ ζωῇ σου· τοπρωὶ ἐρεῖς· πῶς ἂν γένοιτο
ἑσπέρα, καὶ τὸ ἑσπέρας ἐρεῖς· πῶς ἂν γένοιτο πρωί· ἀπὸ τοῦ
φόβου τῆς καρδίας σου ἃ φοβηθήσῃ, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ὁραμάτων τῶν
68 ὀφθαλμῶν σου ὧν ὄψῃ. Καὶ ἀποστρέψει σε Κύριος εἰς Αἴγυπτον
ἐν πλοίοις καὶ ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ ᾗ εἶπά σοι, οὐ προσθήσεσθε ἔτι ἰδεῖν

56 And the woman that is pale among you, and exceeding delicate, whose foot hath not essayed to tread upon the earth for delicateness and for tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward her husband who is in her bosom, and toward her son and toward her daughter,
57 Yea, and toward her afterbirth that issued forth from between her thighs, and toward her child which she shall bear; for she shall eat them secretly because of the want of all things, in the straitness and in the tribulation wherewith thine enemy shall afflict thee
58 in [all] thy cities; if ye shall not hearken to do all the words of this law which are written in this book, [and] to fear this glorious and wondrous Name,
59 [even] the Lord thy God. Then shall the Lord make thy plagues wondrous, and the plagues of thy seed, great and wondrous plagues,
60 and evil and faithful diseases; and He shall turn back upon thee all the evil anguish of Egypt, which thou didst avoid from their presence,
61 and they shall cleave unto thee. Moreover, every sickness and every plague, that which is not written (and all that is written) in the book of this law, the Lord shall bring upon thee,
62 until He hath utterly destroyed thee; and ye shall be left in a small number, whereas ye were heretofore as the stars of heaven for multitude; because ye did not
63 hearken unto the voice of the Lord your God. And it shall come to pass, that as the Lord rejoiced over you, to do you good and to multiply you, so shall the Lord rejoice over you, to destroy you utterly, and to cut you off; and ye shall be plucked up from the land, into
64 which land ye are entering there to inherit it. And the Lord thy God shall scatter thee among all nations, from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth; and there shalt thou serve other gods, of wood and of stone, which neither thou didst know,
65 nor thy fathers. But even among those nations shalt thou find no rest, nor shall there be any resting-place for the sole of thy foot; and the Lord shall give thee there a fainthearted spirit, and eyes failing,
66 and a melting soul. And thy life shall hang suspended before thine eyes; and thou shalt fear day and night,
67 and shalt not believe in thy life. In the morning thou shalt say, 'Would God it were evening!' and at evening thou shalt say, 'Would God it were morning!' for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sights of thine eyes which
68 thou shalt behold. And the Lord shall bring thee again into Egypt with ships, and by the way whereof I spake unto thee, 'Ye shall not add to see it again;'
