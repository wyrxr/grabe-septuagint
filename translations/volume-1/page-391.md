11 ὕμεῖς διαβήσεσθε τὸν Ἰορδάνην τοῦτον, εἰσελθόντες κατασχεῖν τὴν γῆν, ἣν Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τῶν πατέρων ὑμῶν δίδωσιν ὑμῖν κληρονομεῖν αὐτήν.
12 Καὶ τῷ Ῥουβήν, καὶ τῷ Γάδ, καὶ τῷ ἡμίσει φυλῆς Μανασσῆ εἶπεν Ἰησοῦς, λέγων·
13 μνήσθητε τὸ ῥῆμα Κυρίου, ὃ ἐνετείλατο ὑμῖν Μωυσῆς ὁ παῖς Κυρίου, λέγων· Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς
14 ὑμῶν κατέπαυσεν ὑμᾶς, καὶ ἔδωκεν ὑμῖν τὴν γῆν ταύτην. Αἱ γυναῖκες ὑμῶν, καὶ τὰ παιδία ὑμῶν, καὶ τὰ κτήνη ὑμῶν κατοικείτωσαν ἐν τῇ γῇ, ἣν ἔδωκεν ὑμῖν Μωυσῆς πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου·
15 ὕμεῖς δὲ διαβήσεσθε εὔζωνοι πρότερον τῶν ἀδελφῶν ὑμῶν, πᾶς ὁ ἰσχύων τῇ δυνάμει, καὶ συμμαχήσητε αὐτοῖς, ἕως ἂν καταπαύσῃ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς ὑμῶν, ὥσπερ καὶ ὑμᾶς, καὶ κληρονομήσουσαι καὶ οὗτοι τὴν γῆν, ἣν Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν δίδωσιν αὐτοῖς· καὶ ἀπελεύσεσθε ἕκαστος εἰς γῆν κληρονομίας ἑαυτοῦ, καὶ κληρονομήσετε αὐτήν, ἣν ἔδωκεν ὑμῖν Μωυσῆς ὁ παῖς Κυρίου, ἐν τῷ πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου ἀπ’ ἀνατολῶν ἡλίου.
16 Καὶ ἀποκριθέντες τῷ Ἰησοῦ, εἶπαν· πάντα ὅσα ἂν ἐντείλῃ ἡμῖν, ποιήσομεν, καὶ εἰς
17 πάντα τόπον οὗ ἐὰν ἀποστείλῃς ἡμᾶς, πορευσόμεθα· κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἠκούσαμεν Μωυσῆ, οὕτως ἀκουσόμεθά σου· πλὴν ἔστω Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν μετὰ σοῦ, ὃν τρόπον ἦν μετὰ Μωυσῆ.
18 Ὁ δὲ ἄνθρωπος ὃς ἐὰν ἀπειθήσῃ σοι, καὶ ὃς ἐὰν μὴ ἀκούσῃ τῶν ῥημάτων σου, καθότι ἂν ἐντείλῃ αὐτῷ, ἀποθανέτω· ἀλλὰ ἴσχυε καὶ ἀνδρίζου.

1 ΚΑΙ ἀπέστειλεν Ἰησοῦς υἱὸς Ναυῆ ἐκ Σαττεὶν δύο νεανίσκους, κατασκοπεῦσαι κρυφῇ, λέγων· ἀνάβητε καὶ ἴδετε τὴν γῆν καὶ τὴν Ἱεριχώ. Καὶ πορευθέντες οἱ δύο νεανίσκοι ἦλθον εἰς Ἱεριχώ, καὶ
2 εἰσῆλθον εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν γυναικὸς πόρνης, ᾗ ὄνομα Ῥαάβ· καὶ κατέλυσαν ἐκεῖ. Καὶ ἀπηγγέλῃ τῷ βασιλεῖ Ἱεριχώ, λέγοντες· ἰδοὺ ἄνδρες εἰσπεπόρευονται ὧδε τὴν νύκτα ἐκ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ κατασκοπεῦσαι τὴν γῆν.
3 Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἱεριχώ, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς Ῥαάβ, λέγων· ἐξάγαγε τοὺς ἄνδρας τοὺς εἰσπεπορευμένους πρός σε, οἳ εἰσῆλθον εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν σου τὴν νύκτα· κατασκοπεῦσαι
4 γὰρ πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν ἥκασι. Καὶ λαβοῦσα ἡ γυνὴ τοὺς δύο ἄνδρας, ἔκρυψεν αὐτούς, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς, λέγουσα· εἰσεληλύθασι πρὸς με

ye shall cross over this Jordan, going in to possess the land, which the Lord your God giveth unto you to inherit it."

**Chapter I.**
12 And unto the Reubenites, and unto the Gadites, and unto the half-tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying:
13 "Remember ye the word of the Lord, which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you, saying, 'The Lord your God
14 hath given you rest, and hath given you this land. Your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle shall dwell in the land which Moses gave you beyond Jordan;
15 but ye shall pass over equipped for battle before your brethren, every man who is strong in might, and ye shall fight with them, until the Lord our God shall give rest unto your brethren, even as He hath given it unto you, and these also shall inherit the land which the Lord your God giveth them. And then shall ye return every man unto his own land of inheritance, and ye shall inherit it, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you on the other side of Jordan, toward the rising of the sun.'"

16 And they answered Joshua, saying, "All that thou commandest us will we do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.
17 According to all things whatsoever we hearkened unto Moses, so will we hearken unto thee. Only let the Lord our God be with thee, in such wise as He was with Moses.
18 Whosoever man he be that doth rebel against thee, and whosoever he be that doth not hearken unto thy words, in whatsoever thou commandest him, let him die. But be strong and be courageous."

**Chapter II.**
1 And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Sattin two young men to spy secretly, saying, "Go ye up and view the land, even Jericho." And the two young men departed and came into Jericho, and
2 entered into the house of a harlot woman, whose name was Rahab; and they lodged there. And it was told unto the king of Jericho, saying, "Behold, men are come in hither this night from among the children of Israel to spy out the land."
3 And the king of Jericho sent and spake unto Rahab, saying, "Bring forth the men that are come unto thee, who entered into thy house this night;
4 for to spy out all the land are they come." And the woman took the two men and hid them, and said unto them, saying, "Men are come unto me—"
