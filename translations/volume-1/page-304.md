**18** And the first day shall be unto you a holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work.
**19** And ye shall offer a burnt offering, an oblation unto the Lord: two bullocks from the herd, one ram, and seven yearling lambs; unblemished shall they be unto you.
**20** And their meal offering shall be of fine flour, mingled with oil; three tenths [parts] for the one bullock, and two tenths [parts] for the one ram shall ye prepare.
**21** A tenth part apiece shalt thou prepare for each one lamb, [that is,] for the seven lambs.
**22** And one kid of the goats for a sin offering, to make atonement for you.
**23** And these [offerings] shall ye prepare, besides the continual burnt offering of the morning, which is the perpetual burnt offering.
**24** After this manner shall ye prepare [your offerings] daily throughout the seven days, a gift, an oblation of a sweet savour unto the Lord; upon the continual burnt offering shalt thou make its libation.
**25** And the seventh day shall be unto you a holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work therein.
**26** And in the day of the new [firstfruits], when ye offer a new meal offering unto the Lord, [at the Feast] of Weeks, it shall be unto you a holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work.

**28** Their meal offering shall be of fine flour, mingled with oil; three tenths [parts] for the one bullock,
**29** And two tenths [parts] for the one ram; a tenth part apiece for each one lamb, [that is,] for the seven lambs.
**30** And one kid of the goats for a sin offering, to make atonement for you.
**31** And besides the burnt offering (of the New Moon and their meal offering, and the burnt offering, which is the continual one) and its meal offering, ye shall prepare [these] for Me. Unblemished shall they be unto you, and their libations.
