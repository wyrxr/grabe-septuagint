34 ἐν τῷ λαῷ πληγὴν μεγάλην σφόδρα. Καὶ ἐκλήθη τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ τό-
35 που ἐκείνου, Μνήματα τῆς ἐπιθυμίας· ὅτι ἐκεῖ ἔθαψαν τὸν λαὸν
  τὸν ἐπιθυμητήν. Ἀπὸ μνημάτων τῆς ἐπιθυμίας ἐξῆρεν ὁ λαὸς εἰς
  Ἀσηρώθ, καὶ ἐγένετο ὁ λαὸς ἐν Ἀσηρώθ.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΒ'. ΧΙΙ.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐλάλησε Μαριὰμ καὶ Ἀαρὼν κατὰ Μωυσῆ, ἕνεκεν τῆς
  γυναικὸς τῆς Αἰθιοπίσσης ἧς ἔλαβε Μωυσῆς, ὅτι γυναῖκα Αἰθιόπισ-
2 σαν ἔλαβε. Καὶ εἶπαν· μὴ Μωυσῇ μόνῳ ἐλάλησε Κύριος; οὐχὶ
3 καὶ ἐν ἡμῖν ἐλάλησε; καὶ ἤκουσε Κύριος. Καὶ ὁ ἄνθρωπος Μωυ-
  σῆς πραῢς σφόδρα παρὰ πάντας τοὺς ἀνθρώπους τοὺς ὄντας ἐπὶ
4 τῆς γῆς. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος παραχρῆμα πρὸς Μωυσῆν, καὶ Μα-
  ριάμ, καὶ Ἀαρών· ἐξέλθατε ὑμεῖς οἱ τρεῖς εἰς τὴν σκηνὴν τοῦ
  μαρτυρίου· καὶ ἐξῆλθον οἱ τρεῖς εἰς τὴν σκηνὴν τοῦ μαρτυρίου.
5 Καὶ κατέβη Κύριος ἐν στύλῳ νεφέλης, καὶ ἔστη ἐπὶ τῆς θύρας
  τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου· καὶ ἐκλήθησαν Ἀαρὼν καὶ Μαριάμ,
6 καὶ ἐξῆλθοσαν ἀμφότεροι. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτούς· ἀκούσατε δὴ τῶν
  λόγων μου· ἐὰν γένηται προφήτης ὑμῶν Κυρίῳ, ἐν ὁράματι αὐ-
7 τῷ γνωσθήσομαι, καὶ ἐν ὕπνῳ λαλήσω αὐτῷ. Οὐχ οὕτως (ὡς) ὁ
8 θεράπων μου Μωυσῆς, ἐν ὅλῳ τῷ οἴκῳ μου πιστὸς ἐστι· στόμα
  κατὰ στόμα λαλήσω αὐτῷ ἐν εἴδει, καὶ οὐ δι᾿ αἰνιγμάτων, καὶ
  τὴν δόξαν Κυρίου εἶδε· καὶ διατὶ οὐκ ἐφοβήθητε καταλαλῆσαι κα-
9 τὰ τοῦ θεράποντός μου Μωυσῆ; Καὶ ὀργὴ θυμοῦ Κυρίου ἐπ᾿ αὐ-
10 τοῖς, καὶ ἀπῆλθε. Καὶ ἡ νεφέλη ἀπῆλθεν ἀπὸ τῆς σκηνῆς, καὶ ἰδοὺ
  Μαριάμ, λεπρῶσα ὡσεὶ χιών· καὶ ἐπέβλεψεν Ἀαρὼν πρὸς Μαριάμ,
11 καὶ ἰδοὺ λεπρῶσα. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἀαρὼν πρὸς Μωυσῆν· δέομαι κύριε,
  μὴ συνεπιθῇ ἡμῖν ἁμαρτίαν, διότι ἠγνοήσαμεν, καθ᾿ ὅτι ἡμάρτο-
12 μεν· μὴ γένοιτο ὡσεὶ ἴσον θανάτῳ, ὡσεὶ ἔκτρωμα ἐκπορευόμενον
  ἐκ μήτρας μητρὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ κατεσθίει τὸ ἥμισυ τῶν σαρκῶν
13 αὐτῆς. Καὶ ἐβόησε Μωυσῆς πρὸς Κύριον, λέγων· ὁ Θεὸς δέομαι
14 σου, ἴασαι αὐτήν. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν· εἰ ὁ πατὴρ
  αὐτῆς πτύων ἐνέπτυσεν εἰς τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτῆς, οὐκ ἐντραπήσεται
  ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας; ἀφορισθήσεται ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας ἔξω τῆς παρεμβολῆς, καὶ
15 μετὰ ταῦτα εἰσελεύσεται. Καὶ ἀφωρίσθη Μαριὰμ ἔξω τῆς παρεμβο-
  λῆς ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας· καὶ ὁ λαὸς οὐκ ἐξῆρεν, ἕως ἐκαθαρίσθη Μαριάμ.

**Note on corrections:**
*   **Verse 11:** The word `συνεπθῇ` was corrected to `συνεπιθῇ`. The original `πθ` sequence is ungrammatical and forms no known verb, rendering the verse nonsensical. The correction to `συνεπιθῇ` (from `συνεπιτίθημι`, "to lay upon, impose") is a minimal emendation that restores grammatical coherence and aligns with established Septuagint textual traditions for this verse, implying a missing iota (`ι`) in the original printing. Other minor corrections involved standardizing `δ` to `ὁ` for the definite article, which is a common OCR error.

### CHAPTER 12

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
1 And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses, because of the Ethiopian woman whom Moses had taken, for he had indeed taken an Ethiopian woman.
2 And they said, "Hath the Lord spoken only by Moses? Hath He not also spoken by us?" And the Lord heard it.
3 Now the man Moses was exceedingly meek, above all the men who were upon the face of the earth.
4 And the Lord spake suddenly unto Moses, and unto Miriam, and unto Aaron, "Come ye three forth unto the tabernacle of witness." And the three went forth unto the tabernacle of witness.
5 And the Lord came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of the tabernacle of witness; and Aaron and Miriam were called,
6 and both of them came forth. And He said unto them, "Hear now my words: If there be among you a prophet of the Lord, in a vision will I make Myself known unto him, and in a dream will I speak unto him.
7 Not so [it is with] my servant Moses, who is faithful in all My house.
8 Mouth to mouth will I speak unto him, in plain sight, and not through dark sayings; and the glory of the Lord hath he seen. Wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?"
9 And the wrath of the Lord was kindled against them, and He departed.
10 And the cloud departed from the tabernacle, and behold, Miriam was leprous as snow. And Aaron looked upon Miriam,
11 and behold, she was leprous. And Aaron said unto Moses, "I beseech [thee], my lord, lay not sin upon us, for we have dealt foolishly, and for that we have sinned.
12 Let her not be as one dead, as a stillborn child issuing from its mother's womb, whose flesh is already half consumed."
13 And Moses cried unto the Lord, saying, "O God, I beseech Thee, heal her now."
14 And the Lord said unto Moses, "If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? She shall be shut out from the camp seven days, and after that she shall be received in again."
15 And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days; and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again.
