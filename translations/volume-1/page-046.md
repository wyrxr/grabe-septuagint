δὲ Ἀβιμέλεχ βασιλεὺς Γεράρων, καὶ ἔλαβε τὴν Σάρραν. Καὶ εἰσῆλθεν 3
ὁ Θεὸς πρὸς Ἀβιμέλεχ ἐν ὕπνῳ τὴν νύκτα, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· ἰδοὺ σὺ
ἀποθνήσκεις περὶ τῆς γυναικός, ἧς ἔλαβες· αὕτη δὲ ἐστι συνῳκηκυῖα
ἀνδρί. Ἀβιμέλεχ δὲ οὐχ ἥψατο αὐτῆς, καὶ εἶπε· Κύριε, ἔθνος ἀγνοοῦν 4
καὶ δίκαιον ἀπολεῖς; Οὐκ αὐτός μοι εἶπεν· ἀδελφή μου ἐστιν; καὶ 5
αὕτη μοι εἶπεν· ἀδελφός μου ἐστιν; ἐν καθαρᾷ καρδίᾳ, καὶ ἐν δικαιοσύ-
νῃ χειρῶν ἐποίησα τοῦτο. Εἶπε δὲ αὐτῷ ὁ Θεὸς καθ᾿ ὕπνον· κἀγὼ 6
ἔγνων ὅτι ἐν καθαρᾷ καρδίᾳ ἐποίησας τοῦτο, καὶ ἐφεισάμην ἐγώ
σου, τοῦ μὴ ἁμαρτεῖν σε εἰς ἐμέ· ἕνεκεν τούτου οὐκ ἀφῆκά σε
ἁψασθαι αὐτῆς. Νῦν δὲ ἀπόδος τὴν γυναῖκα τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ ὅτι προ- 7
φήτης ἐστι, καὶ προσεύξεται περὶ σοῦ, καὶ ζήσῃ· εἰ δὲ μὴ ἀπο-
δίδως, γνῶθι ὅτι ἀποθανῇ σὺ καὶ πάντα τὰ σά. Καὶ ὤρθρισεν 8
Ἀβιμέλεχ τὸ πρωΐ, καὶ ἐκάλεσε πάντας τοὺς παῖδας αὐτοῦ, καὶ
ἐλάλησε πάντα τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα εἰς τὰ ὦτα αὐτῶν· ἐφοβήθησαν
δὲ πάντες οἱ ἄνθρωποι σφόδρα. Καὶ ἐκάλεσεν Ἀβιμέλεχ τὸν 9
Ἀβραάμ, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· τί τοῦτο ἐποίησας ἡμῖν; μήτι ἡμάρτο-
μεν εἰς σέ, ὅτι ἐπήγαγες ἐπ᾿ ἐμὲ καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν βασιλείαν μου ἁ-
μαρτίαν μεγάλην; ἔργον ὃ οὐδεὶς ποιήσει, πεποίηκάς με. Εἶπε δὲ 10
Ἀβιμέλεχ τῷ Ἀβραάμ· τί ἐνιδών, ἐποίησας τοῦτο; Εἶπε δὲ 11
Ἀβραάμ· εἶπα γάρ· ἄρα οὐκ ἔστι θεοσέβεια ἐν τῷ τόπῳ τούτῳ,
ἐμέ τε ἀποκτενοῦσιν ἕνεκεν τῆς γυναικός μου. Καὶ γὰρ ἀληθῶς 12
ἀδελφή μου ἐστίν ἐκ πατρός, ἀλλ᾿ οὐκ ἐκ μητρός· ἐγενήθη δέ μοι
εἰς γυναῖκα. Ἐγένετο δὲ ἡνίκα ἐξήγαγέ με ὁ Θεὸς ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου 13
τοῦ πατρός μου, καὶ εἶπα αὐτῇ· ταύτην τὴν δικαιοσύνην ποίησον
ἐπ᾿ ἐμέ· εἰς πάντα τόπον οὗ ἐὰν εἰσέλθωμεν ἐκεῖ, εἶπον ἐμέ,
ὅτι ἀδελφός μου ἐστίν. Ἔλαβε δὲ Ἀβιμέλεχ χίλια δίδραχμα, 14
πρόβατα καὶ μόσχους, καὶ παῖδας καὶ παιδίσκας, καὶ ἔδωκε τῷ
Ἀβραὰμ καὶ ἀπέδωκεν αὐτῷ Σάρραν τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ. Καὶ 15
εἶπεν Ἀβιμέλεχ τῷ Ἀβραάμ· ἰδοὺ ἡ γῆ μου ἐναντίον σου· οὗ
ἐάν σοι ἀρέσκῃ, κατοίκει. Τῇ δὲ Σάρρᾳ εἶπεν· ἰδοὺ δέδωκα χίλια 16
δίδραχμα τῷ ἀδελφῷ σου· ταῦτα ἔσται σοι εἰς τιμὴν τοῦ προσώ-
που σου, καὶ πάσαις ταῖς μετὰ σοῦ· καὶ πάντα ἀλήθευσον. Προ- 17
σηύξατο δὲ Ἀβραὰμ πρὸς τὸν Θεόν, καὶ ἰάσατο ὁ Θεὸς τὸν Ἀβι-
μέλεχ, καὶ τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰς παιδίσκας αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔ-
τεκον ὅτι συγκλείων συνέκλεισε Κύριος ἔξωθεν πᾶσαν μήτραν ἐν 18
τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ Ἀβιμέλεχ, ἕνεκεν Σάρρας τῆς γυναικὸς Ἀβραάμ.

**Chapter 20.**

**3** Now Abimelech, king of Gerar, had taken Sarah. And God came unto Abimelech in a dream by night, and spake unto him, saying, "Behold, thou art as one dead, because of the woman whom thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife."

**4** But Abimelech had not drawn near unto her, and he said, "Lord, wilt Thou destroy a nation, [though it be] ignorant and righteous?"

**5** "Did not he himself say unto me, 'She is my sister'? And she, even she, said unto me, 'He is my brother'? With a pure heart, and with the righteousness of my hands, have I done this deed."

**6** And God spake unto him in a dream, [saying,] "Yea, I know that with a pure heart thou didst this; and I spared thee, that thou shouldst not sin against Me. For this cause I suffered thee not to draw near unto her."

**7** "Now therefore, restore the wife unto the man, for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live. But if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine."

**8** And Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and spake all these words in their ears; and all the men feared exceedingly.

**9** And Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, "What is this that thou hast done unto us? Have we sinned against thee, that thou hast brought upon me and upon my kingdom a great sin? Thou hast wrought upon me a deed which none ought to do."

**10** And Abimelech said unto Abraham, "What didst thou behold, that thou didst this?"

**11** And Abraham said, "Because I said, 'Surely there is no fear of God in this place, and they will slay me for my wife's sake.'"

**12** "And indeed, she is truly my sister, the daughter of my father, yet not the daughter of my mother; and she became unto me a wife."

**13** "And it came to pass, when God brought me forth from my father's house, that I said unto her, 'This kindness show thou unto me: in every place wheresoever we shall enter therein, say concerning me, that he is my brother.'"

**14** And Abimelech took a thousand didrachmas, and sheep, and oxen, and male servants, and female servants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored unto him Sarah his wife.

**15** And Abimelech said unto Abraham, "Behold, my land is before thee; dwell thou wherever it pleaseth thee."

**16** And unto Sarah he said, "Behold, I have given a thousand didrachmas unto thy brother; these shall be unto thee for a covering of thine eyes, and unto all that are with thee; and in all things, be thou vindicated."

**17** And Abraham prayed unto God; and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his female servants, and they bore children;

**18** For the Lord had utterly closed up every womb from without in the household of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.
