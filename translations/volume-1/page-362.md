ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ φάγῃ, αὐτὸ δὲ οὐκ ἐκκόψεις. Μὴ ἄνθρωπος τὸ ξύλον
τὸ ἐν τῷ ἐρημῷ, εἰσελθεῖν ἀπὸ προσώπου σου εἰς τὸν χάρακα;
Ἀλλὰ τὸ ξύλον δ´ ἐπίστασαι ὅτι οὐ καρπόβρωτόν ἐστι, τοῦτο ἐξο- 20
λοθρεύσεις καὶ ἐκκόψεις, καὶ οἰκοδομήσεις χαράκωσιν ἐπὶ τὴν πό-
λιν, ἥτις ποιεῖ πρὸς σὲ τὸν πόλεμον, ἕως ἂν παραδοθῇ.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΑ´. XXI.

ΕΑΝ δὲ εὑρεθῇ τραυματίας ἐν τῇ γῇ, ἣν Κύριος ὁ Θεός 1
σοῦ δίδωσι σοι κληρονομῆσαι αὐτήν, πεπτωκὼς ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ, καὶ
οὐκ οἴδασι τὸν πατάξαντα αὐτόν, ἐξελεύσεται ἡ γερουσία σου καὶ 2
οἱ κριταί σου, καὶ ἐκμετρήσουσιν ἐπὶ τὰς πόλεις τὰς κύκλῳ τοῦ
τραυματίου· καὶ ἔσται ἡ πόλις ἡ ἐγγίζουσα τῷ τραυματίᾳ, καὶ 3
λήψεται ἡ γερουσία τῆς πόλεως ἐκείνης δάμαλιν ἐκ βοῶν, ἥτις
οὐκ εἴργασται, καὶ ἥτις οὐχ εἵλκυσε ζυγόν· καὶ καταβιβάσουσιν ἡ 4
γερουσία τῆς πόλεως ἐκείνης τὴν δάμαλιν εἰς φάραγγα τραχεῖαν,
ἥτις οὐκ εἴργασται, οὐδὲ σπείρεται, καὶ νευροκοπήσουσι τὴν δάμα-
λιν ἐν τῇ φάραγγι. Καὶ προσελεύσονται οἱ ἱερεῖς οἱ Λευῖται· ἔτι 5
αὐτοὺς ἐξελέξατο Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου παρεστηκέναι αὐτῷ, καὶ εὐλο-
γεῖν ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπὶ τῷ στόματι αὐτῶν ἔσται πᾶ-
σα ἀντιλογία καὶ πᾶσα ἀφή. Καὶ πᾶσα ἡ γερουσία τῆς πόλεως 6
ἐκείνης, οἱ ἐγγίζοντες τῷ τραυματίᾳ, νίψονται τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν
ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν τῆς δαμάλεως τῆς νευροκοπημένης ἐν τῇ φά-
ραγγι· καὶ ἀποκριθέντες ἐροῦσιν· αἱ χεῖρες ἡμῶν οὐκ ἐξέχεαν τὸ 7
αἷμα τοῦτο, καὶ οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ ἡμῶν οὐχ ἑωράκασιν. Ἵλεως γενοῦ 8
τῷ λαῷ σου Ἰσραήλ, οὓς ἐλυτρώσω Κύριε ἐκ γῆς Ἀγύπτου, ἵνα
μὴ γένηται αἷμα ἀναίτιον ἐν τῷ λαῷ σου Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἐξιλα-
σθήσεται αὐτοῖς τὸ αἷμα. Σὺ δὲ ἐξαρεῖς τὸ αἷμα τὸ ἀναίτιον ἐξ 9
ὑμῶν αὐτῶν, ἐὰν ποιήσῃς τὸ καλὸν καὶ τὸ ἀρεστὸν ἔναντι Κυ-
ρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ. Ἐὰν δὲ ἐξέλθῃς εἰς πόλεμον ἐπὶ τοὺς ἐχθρούς 10
σου, καὶ παραδῷ αὐτοὺς Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου εἰς τὰς χεῖράς σου,
καὶ προνομεύσῃς τὴν προνομὴν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἴδῃς ἐν τῇ προνομῇ γυ- 11
ναῖκα καλὴν τῷ εἴδει, καὶ ἐπιθυμηθῇς αὐτῆς, καὶ λάβῃς αὐτὴν σε- 12
αυτῷ γυναῖκα, καὶ εἰσάξεις αὐτὴν ἔνδον εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν σου, καὶ
ξυρήσεις τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτῆς, καὶ περιονυχιεῖς αὐτήν, καὶ περιελεῖς 13
τὰ ἱμάτια τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας αὐτῆς ἀπ᾿ αὐτῆς· καὶ καθιεῖται ἐν τῇ

## DEUTERONOMY

### Chapter 20

19 Whereof thou mayest eat; but thou shalt not cut it down. For is the tree of the desert a man, that it should come before thee into the siege?
20 But the tree which thou knowest is not fruit-bearing, that shalt thou utterly destroy and cut down; and thou shalt build up bulwarks against the city that maketh war against thee, until it be delivered.

### Chapter 21

1 If there be found a slain man in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee to inherit it, lying in the field, and it is not known who hath smitten him;
2 Then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain.
3 And it shall be, that the city which is next unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take an heifer of the herd, which hath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the yoke.
4 And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer into a rough valley, which is neither tilled nor sown, and shall hamstring the heifer there in the valley.
5 And the priests, the sons of Levi, shall come near; for them hath the Lord thy God chosen to minister unto Him, and to bless in the Name of the Lord; and by their mouth shall every controversy and every [matter of] judgment be [determined].
6 And all the elders of that city, which are nearest unto the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer that was hamstrung in the valley.
7 And they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it.
8 Be merciful, O Lord, unto Thy people Israel, whom Thou hast redeemed out of the land of Egypt, and lay not innocent blood unto Thy people of Israel's charge. And the blood shall be atoned for them.
9 So shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you, when thou shalt do that which is right and pleasing in the sight of the Lord thy God.
10 When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the Lord thy God hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou hast taken their spoil,
11 And seest among the captives a woman fair to look upon,
12 And hast a desire unto her, and wouldest take her to thee to wife; Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house, and shalt shave her head, and pare her nails;
13 And shalt put off her raiment of her captivity from her; and she shall remain in thy house,
