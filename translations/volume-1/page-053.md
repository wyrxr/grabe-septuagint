21 σατο πάσαις ταῖς καμήλοις. Ὁ δὲ ἄνθρωπος κατεμάνθανεν αὐτήν· καὶ παρεσιώπα τοῦ γνῶναι εἰ εὐώδωκε Κύριος τὴν ὁδὸν αὐτοῦ,
22 ἢ οὔ. Ἐγένετο δὲ ἡνίκα ἐπαύσαντο (πᾶσαι) αἱ κάμηλοι πίνουσαι, ἔλαβεν ὁ ἄνθρωπος ἐνώτια χρυσᾶ ἀνὰ δραχμὴν ὀλκῆς, καὶ δύο ψέλλια ἐπὶ τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῆς· δέκα χρυσῶν ὀλκὴ αὐτῶν.
23 Καὶ ἐπηρώτησεν αὐτήν, καὶ εἶπε· θυγάτηρ τίνος εἶ; ἀνάγγειλόν μοι, εἰ ἔστι παρὰ τῷ πατρί σου τόπος ἡμῖν καταλῦσαι.
24 Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· θυγάτηρ Βαθουήλ εἰμι ἐγώ, τοῦ Μελχᾶς, ὃν ἔτεκε τῷ Ναχώρ.
25 Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· καὶ ἄχυρα καὶ χόρτασμα πολὺ παρ᾿ ἡμῖν, καὶ τόπος τοῦ καταλῦσαι.
26 Καὶ εὐδοκήσας ὁ ἄνθρωπος προσεκύνησε Κυρίῳ, καὶ εἶπεν· εὐλογητὸς Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ κυρίου μου Ἀβραάμ, ὃς οὐκ ἐγκατέλιπε τὴν δικαιοσύνην αὐτοῦ καὶ τὴν ἀλήθειαν ἀπὸ τοῦ κυρίου μου· ἐμὲ εὐώδωκε Κύριος εἰς οἶκον τοῦ
28 ἀδελφοῦ τοῦ κυρίου μου. Καὶ δραμοῦσα ἡ παῖς, ἀπήγγειλεν εἰς τὸν οἶκον τῆς μητρὸς αὐτῆς κατὰ τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα.
29 Τῇ δὲ Ῥεβέκκα ἀδελφὸς ἦν, ᾧ ὄνομα Λάβαν· καὶ ἔδραμε Λάβαν πρὸς τὸν ἄνθρωπον ἔξω ἐπὶ τὴν πηγήν.
30 Καὶ ἐγένετο ἡνίκα ἴδε τὰ ἐνώτια καὶ τὰ ψέλλια ἐπὶ τὰς χεῖρας τῆς ἀδελφῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὅτε ἤκουσε τὰ ῥήματα Ῥεβέκκας τῆς ἀδελφῆς αὐτοῦ, λεγούσης· οὕτω λελάληκέ μοι ὁ ἄνθρωπος· καὶ ἦλθε πρὸς τὸν ἄνθρωπον, ἑστηκότος αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τῶν καμήλων ἐπὶ τῆς πηγῆς.
31 Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· δεῦρο, εἴσελθε εὐλογητὸς Κυρίου, ἵνατί ἕστηκας ἔξω; ἐγὼ δὲ ἡτοίμασα τὴν οἰκίαν καὶ τόπον ταῖς καμήλοις.
32 Εἰσῆλθε δὲ ὁ ἄνθρωπος εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν· καὶ ἀπέσαξε τὰς καμήλους, καὶ ἔδωκεν ἄχυρα καὶ χορτάσματα ταῖς καμήλοις, καὶ ὕδωρ νίψασθαι τοῖς ποσὶν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοῖς ποσὶ τῶν ἀνδρῶν τῶν μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ·
33 καὶ παρέθηκεν αὐτοῖς ἄρτους φαγεῖν. Καὶ εἶπεν· οὐ μὴ φάγω, ἕως τοῦ λαλῆσαί με τὰ ῥήματά μου. Καὶ εἶπε· λάλησον.
34 Καὶ εἶπε· παῖς Ἀβραὰμ ἐγώ εἰμι.
35 Κύριος δὲ εὐλόγησε τὸν κύριόν μου σφόδρα, καὶ ὑψώθη· καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ πρόβατα καὶ μόσχους, καὶ ἀργύριον καὶ χρυσίον, καὶ παῖδας καὶ παιδίσκας, καὶ καμήλους καὶ ὄνους.
36 Καὶ ἔτεκε Σάρρα ἡ γυνὴ τοῦ κυρίου μου υἱὸν (ἕνα) τῷ κυρίῳ μου, μετὰ τὸ γηρᾶσαι αὐτήν· καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ πάντα ὅσα ἦν αὐτῷ.
37 Καὶ ὥρκισέ με ὁ κύριός μου, λέγων· οὐ λήψῃ γυναῖκα τῷ υἱῷ μου ἀπὸ τῶν θυγατέρων τῶν Χαναναίων, ἐν οἷς ἐγὼ παροικῶ ἐν τῇ γῇ αὐτῶν·
38 ἀλλ᾿ ἢ εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ πατρός μου πορεύσῃ, καὶ εἰς τὴν φυλὴν

**English Translation:**

**Chapter 24**
**21** [She] had watered all the camels. And the man observed her closely, and kept silent, seeking to know if the Lord had prospered his journey, or no.
**22** And it came to pass, when all the camels had ceased drinking, that the man took forth golden earrings, each of a drachma’s weight, and two bracelets upon her hands; the weight of them was ten golden [drachmas].
**23** And he questioned her, and said, “Whose daughter art thou? Tell me, I pray thee, if there be with thy father a place for us to lodge.”
**24** And she said unto him, “I am the daughter of Bethuel, son of Milcah, whom she bore unto Nahor.”
**25** And she said unto him, “Both straw and much provender have we, and a place to lodge therein.”
**26** And the man bowed down and worshipped the Lord, and said, “Blessed be the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, who hath not forsaken His righteousness and His truth from my master; the Lord hath prospered me into the house of my master’s brother.”
**28** And the damsel ran and told these things to her mother’s house.
**29** Now Rebekah had a brother, whose name was Laban; and Laban ran out unto the man, to the well.
**30** And it came to pass, when he saw the earrings and the bracelets upon his sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, “Thus spake the man unto me;” that he came unto the man, as he stood by the camels at the well.
**31** And he said unto him, “Come in, thou blessed of the Lord; why standest thou without? For I have prepared the house and a place for the camels.”
**32** And the man came into the house; and he unloaded the camels, and gave straw and fodder unto the camels, and water to wash his own feet, and the feet of the men that were with him.
**33** And [Laban] set bread before them to eat. But [the man] said, “I will not eat, until I have spoken my words.” And [Laban] said, “Speak forth.”
**34** And he said, “I am Abraham’s servant.
**35** And the Lord hath blessed my master greatly, and he hath become great; and He hath given him sheep and calves, and silver and gold, and menservants and maidservants, and camels and asses.
**36** And Sarah, my master’s wife, bore a son (one) unto my master, after she was old; and he hath given unto him all that he hath.
**37** And my master made me swear, saying, ‘Thou shalt not take a wife for my son from among the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell as a sojourner;
**38** but thou shalt go unto my father’s house, and unto my kindred,”
