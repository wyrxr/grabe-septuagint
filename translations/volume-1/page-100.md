ὧδε. Καὶ ἐπιπεσὼν ἐπὶ τὸν τράχηλον Βενιαμὶν τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὑ- 14
τοῦ, ἔκλαυσεν ἐπ᾿ αὑτῷ· καὶ Βενιαμὶν ἔκλαυσεν ἐπὶ τῷ τραχή-
λῳ αὑτοῦ. Καὶ καταφιλήσας πάντας τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὑτοῦ, ἔκλαυ- 15
σεν ἐπ᾿ αὑτοῖς· καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα ἐλάλησαν οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὑτοῦ πρὸς
αὑτόν. Καὶ διεβοήθη ἡ φωνὴ εἰς τὸν οἶκον Φαραώ, λέγοντες· ἤ- 16
κασιν οἱ ἀδελφοὶ Ἰωσήφ. Ἐχάρη δὲ Φαραώ, καὶ ἡ θεραπεία αὑ-
τοῦ. Εἶπε δὲ Φαραὼ πρὸς Ἰωσήφ· εἶπον τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς σου· τοῦτο 17
ποιήσατε, γεμίσατε τὰ πόρια ὑμῶν, καὶ ἀπέλθατε εἰς γῆν Χαναάν·
καὶ παραλαβόντες τὸν πατέρα ὑμῶν καὶ τὰ ὑπάρχοντα ὑμῶν, ἤ- 18
κετε πρός με, καὶ δώσω ὑμῖν πάντων τῶν ἀγαθῶν Αἰγύπτου,
καὶ φάγεσθε τὸν μυελὸν τῆς γῆς. Σὺ δὲ ἐντεῖλαι ταῦτα· λαβεῖν αὐ- 19
τοῖς ἁμάξας ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, τοῖς παιδίοις ὑμῶν καὶ ταῖς γυ-
ναῖξιν ὑμῶν, καὶ ἀναλαβόντες τὸν πατέρα ὑμῶν, παραγίνεσθε.
Καὶ μὴ φείσησθε τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς ὑμῶν τῶν σκευῶν ὑμῶν· τὰ γὰρ 20
πάντα ἀγαθὰ τῆς γῆς Αἰγύπτου ὑμῖν ἔσται. Ἐποίησαν δὲ οὕτως 21
οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ· ἔδωκε δὲ Ἰωσὴφ αὐτοῖς ἁμάξας κατὰ τὰ εἰρημέ-
να ὑπὸ Φαραὼ τοῦ βασιλέως, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς ἐπισιτισμὸν εἰς
τὴν ὁδόν· καὶ πᾶσιν ἔδωκε δισσὰς στολάς, καὶ τῷ Βενιαμὶν ἔδωκε 22
τριακοσίους χρυσοῦς, καὶ πέντε ἀλλασσούσας στολάς. Καὶ τῷ πα- 23
τρὶ αὑτοῦ ἀπέστειλε κατὰ τὰ αὐτά, καὶ δέκα ὄνους αἴροντας ἀπὸ
πάντων τῶν ἀγαθῶν Αἰγύπτου, καὶ δέκα ἡμιόνους αἰρούσας ἄρ-
τους τῷ πατρὶ αὑτοῦ εἰς ὁδόν. Ἐξαπέστειλε δὲ τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς 24
αὑτοῦ, καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν· καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· μὴ ὀργίζεσθε ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ.
Καὶ ἀνέβησαν ἐξ Αἰγύπτου, καὶ ἦλθον εἰς γῆν Χαναὰν πρὸς Ἰα- 25
κὼβ τὸν πατέρα αὑτῶν, καὶ ἀνήγγειλαν αὑτῷ, λέγοντες· ἔτι ὁ 26
υἱός σου Ἰωσὴφ ζῇ, καὶ οὗτος ἄρχει πάσης τῆς γῆς Αἰγύπτου.
Καὶ ἐξέστη ἡ διάνοια Ἰακώβ· οὐ γὰρ ἐπίστευσεν αὐτοῖς. Ἐλά- 27
λησαν δὲ αὑτῷ πάντα τὰ ῥηθέντα ὑπὸ Ἰωσήφ, ὅσα εἶπεν αὐτοῖς.
Ἰδὼν δὲ τὰς ἁμάξας, ἃς ἀπέστειλεν Ἰωσήφ, ὥστε ἀναλαβεῖν αὐ-
τόν, ἀνεζωπύρησε τὸ πνεῦμα Ἰακὼβ τοῦ πατρὸς αὑτῶν. Εἶπε δὲ 28
Ἰσραήλ· μέγα μοι ἐστίν, εἰ ἔτι ὁ υἱός μου Ἰωσὴφ ζῇ· πορευθείς,
ὄψομαι αὐτὸν πρὸ τοῦ ἀποθανεῖν με.

The following is the translation of Genesis, Chapter 45, verses 14-28.

**GENESIS CHAPTER 45**

14 And he fell upon the neck of Benjamin, his brother, and wept over him; and Benjamin wept upon his neck.
15 And he kissed all his brothers, and wept over them; and after these things, his brothers did speak to him.
16 And the report was heard throughout the house of Pharaoh, saying, "The brothers of Joseph have come!" And Pharaoh rejoiced, and his household [with him].
17 And Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Say to your brothers, 'Do this: fill your sacks, and depart into the land of Canaan;
18 and take your father and your possessions, and come to me; and I will give you all the good things of Egypt,
19 and you shall eat the fat of the land. Now you, give this command: let them take wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives, and take up your father, and come.
20 And do not let your eyes spare your goods; for all the good things of the land of Egypt shall be yours.'"
21 And so did the sons of Israel. And Joseph gave them wagons, according to the word of Pharaoh the king; and he gave them provisions for the journey.
22 And to all of them he gave two changes of garments, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred [pieces of] gold, and five changes of raiment.
23 And to his father he sent in like manner: ten donkeys laden with all the good things of Egypt, and ten she-mules bearing bread for his father for the journey.
24 And he sent forth his brothers, and they departed. And he said to them, "Do not contend on the way."
25 And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan to Jacob their father,
26 and they told him, saying, "Your son Joseph yet lives, and he rules over all the land of Egypt!"
27 And the spirit of Jacob fainted, for he did not believe them. But they spoke to him all the words which Joseph had spoken to them, all that he had said.
28 But when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived. And Israel said, "It is enough for me! My son Joseph yet lives! I will go and see him before I die."
