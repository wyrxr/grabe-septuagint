37 Καὶ ἀπέθανον οἱ ἄνθρωποι οἱ κατεῖπαντες πονηρὰ κατὰ τῆς γῆς, ἐν τῇ πληγῇ ἔναντι Κυρίου·
38 καὶ Ἰησοῦς υἱὸς Ναυῆ, καὶ Κάλεβ υἱὸς Ἰεφωνῆ ἔζησαν ἀπὸ τῶν ἀνθρώπων ἐκείνων τῶν πεπορευμένων κατασκέψασθαι τὴν γῆν.
39 Καὶ ἐλάλησε Μωυσῆς πάντα τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα πρὸς πάντας υἱοὺς Ἰσραήλ· καὶ ἐπένθησεν ὁ λαὸς σφόδρα.
40 Καὶ ὀρθρίσαντες τὸ πρωΐ, ἀνέβησαν ἐπὶ τὴν κορυφὴν τοῦ ὄρους, λέγοντες· Ἰδοὺ αὐτοὶ ἡμεῖς ἀναβησόμεθα εἰς τὸν τόπον ὃν εἶπε Κύριος, ὅτι ἡμάρτομεν.
41 Καὶ εἶπε Μωυσῆς· Ἵνατί τοῦτο ὑμεῖς παραβαίνετε τὰ ῥήματα Κυρίου; οὐκ εὐοδὰ ἔσται ὑμῖν.
42 Μὴ ἀναβαίνετε· οὐ γὰρ ἔστι Κύριος μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν, καὶ πεσοῖσθε πρὸ προσώπου τῶν ἐχθρῶν ὑμῶν·
43 ὅτι ὁ Ἀμαλὴκ καὶ ὁ Χαναναῖος ἔχει ἔμπροσθεν ὑμῶν, καὶ πεσοῖσθε μαχαίρᾳ, οὗ εἵνεκεν ἀπεστράφητε ἀπειθοῦντες Κυρίῳ, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται Κύριος ἐν ὑμῖν.
44 Καὶ διαβιασάμενοι, ἀνέβησαν ἐπὶ κορυφὴν τοῦ ὄρους· ἡ δὲ κιβωτὸς τῆς διαθήκης Κυρίου καὶ Μωυσῆς οὐκ ἐκινήθησαν ἐκ μέσου τῆς παρεμβολῆς.
45 Κατέβη δὲ ὁ Ἀμαλὴκ καὶ ὁ Χαναναῖος ὁ ἐγκαθήμενος ἐν τῷ ὄρει ἐκείνῳ, καὶ ἐτρέψαντο αὐτοὺς, καὶ κατέκοψαν αὐτοὺς ἕως Ἑρμᾶ· καὶ ἀπεστράφησαν εἰς τὴν παρεμβολήν.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, λέγων·
2 λάλησον τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτούς· ὅταν εἰσέλθητε εἰς τὴν γῆν τῆς κατοικήσεως ὑμῶν, ἣν ἐγὼ δίδωμι ὑμῖν,
3 καὶ ποιήσητε κάρπωμα Κυρίῳ, ὁλοκαύτωμα ἢ θυσίαν, μεγαλῦναι εὐχὴν, ἢ καθ᾿ ἑκούσιον, ἢ ἐν ταῖς ἑορταῖς ὑμῶν, ποιῆσαι ὀσμὴν εὐωδίας Κυρίῳ,
4 εἴ μὲν ἀπὸ τῶν βοῶν, ἢ ἀπὸ τῶν προβάτων, καὶ προσάσει ὁ προσφέρων τὸ δῶρον αὐτοῦ Κυρίῳ, θυσίαν σεμιδάλεως δέκατον τοῦ οἴφι, πεφυραμένης ἐν τετάρτῳ τοῦ Ἴν ἐλαίῳ·
5 καὶ οἶνον εἰς σπονδὴν τὸ τέταρτον τοῦ Ἴν ποιήσετε ἐπὶ τῆς ὁλοκαυτώσεως, ἢ ἐπὶ τῆς θυσίας, τῷ ἀμνῷ τῷ ἑνὶ ποιήσεις τοσοῦτο, κάρπωμα ὀσμὴν εὐωδίας τῷ Κυρίῳ.
6 Καὶ τῷ κριῷ, ὅταν ποιῆτε αὐτὸν εἰς ὁλοκαύτωμα ἢ εἰς θυσίαν, ποιήσεις θυσίαν σεμιδάλεως δύο δέκατα,
7 ἀναπεφυραμένης ἐν ἐλαίῳ τὸ τρίτον τοῦ Ἴν· καὶ οἶνον εἰς σπονδήν.

### Literary Translation

### NUMBERS CHAPTER 14

37 And they died, the men who had spoken evil against the land, by a plague before the Lord.
38 But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, they lived [on] from among those men who had gone forth to spy out the land.
39 And Moses spoke all these words unto all the sons of Israel; and the people mourned exceedingly.
40 And having risen up early in the morning, they ascended to the top of the mountain, saying, "Behold, we ourselves shall go up to the place whereof the Lord did speak, for we have sinned."
41 And Moses said, "Wherefore do ye yourselves transgress the words of the Lord? It shall not prosper unto you.
42 Ascend not, for the Lord is not with you, lest ye fall before the face of your enemies.
43 For the Amalekite and the Canaanite do face you, and ye shall fall by the sword, because ye have turned away, being disobedient to the Lord; and the Lord shall not be among you."
44 But they, having presumed to press on, ascended to the top of the mountain; yet the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and Moses did not move from the midst of the camp.
45 Then came down the Amalekite and the Canaanite, even he that dwelt in that mountain, and they did smite them, and discomfited them, even unto Hormah; and they returned unto the camp.

### CHAPTER 15

1 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
2 "Speak unto the sons of Israel, and say unto them, 'When ye shall enter into the land of your habitation, which I give unto you,
3 and shall make an offering unto the Lord, a burnt offering or a sacrifice, to perform a vow, or as a freewill offering, or in your feasts, to make a sweet savour unto the Lord,
4 whether it be of the cattle, or of the sheep: then shall he that offereth his gift unto the Lord bring near a sacrifice of fine flour, a tenth part of an ephah, mingled in the fourth part of a hin of oil.
5 And a fourth part of a hin of wine for a drink offering shall ye prepare upon the burnt offering, or upon the sacrifice; for the one lamb, thou shalt make so much, even an offering, a sweet savour unto the Lord.
6 And for the ram, when ye shall make it into a burnt offering or into a sacrifice, thou shalt prepare a sacrifice of fine flour, two tenths [of an ephah],
7 mingled in oil, the third part of a hin; and wine for a drink offering."
