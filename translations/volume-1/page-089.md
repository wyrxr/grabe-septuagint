23 καθὰ συνέκρινεν αὐτοῖς Ἰωσήφ. Οὐκ ἐμνήσθη δὲ ὁ ἀρχιοινοχόος τοῦ Ἰωσήφ, ἀλλὰ ἐπελάθετο αὐτοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. ΜΑ΄. XLI.

1 Ἐγένετο δὲ μετὰ δύο ἔτη ἡμερῶν, Φαραὼ ἴδεν ἐνύπνιον.
2 Ὤΐετο ἑστάναι ἐπὶ τοῦ ποταμοῦ· καὶ ἰδοὺ ὥσπερ ἐκ τοῦ ποταμοῦ ἀνέβαινον ἑπτὰ βόες, καλαὶ τῷ εἴδει, καὶ ἐκλεκταὶ ταῖς σαρξί, καὶ
3 ἐβόσκοντο ἐν τῷ Ἄχει. Ἄλλαι δὲ ἑπτὰ βόες ἀνέβαινον μετὰ ταύτας ἐκ τοῦ ποταμοῦ, αἰσχραὶ τῷ εἴδει, καὶ λεπταὶ ταῖς σαρξί, καὶ ἐνέμοντο παρὰ τὰς βόας παρὰ τὸ χεῖλος τοῦ ποταμοῦ (ἐν τῷ Ἄχει).
4 Καὶ κατέφαγον αἱ ἑπτὰ βόες αἱ αἰσχραὶ τῷ εἴδει, καὶ λεπταὶ ταῖς σαρξί, τὰς ἑπτὰ βόας τὰς καλὰς τῷ εἴδει καὶ τὰς ἐκλεκτάς.
5 Ἠγέρθη δὲ Φαραώ. Καὶ ἐνυπνιάσθη τὸ δεύτερον· καὶ ἰδοὺ ἑπτὰ στάχυες ἀνέβαινον ἐν πυθμένι ἑνί, ἐκλεκτοὶ καὶ καλοί.
6 Ἄλλοι δὲ ἑπτὰ στάχυες λεπτοὶ καὶ ἀνεμόφθοροι ἀνεφύοντο μετ᾿ αὐτούς.
7 Καὶ κατέπιον οἱ ἑπτὰ στάχυες οἱ λεπτοὶ (καὶ ἀνεμόφθοροι) τοὺς ἑπτὰ στάχυας τοὺς ἐκλεκτοὺς καὶ τοὺς πλήρεις. Ἠγέρθη
8 δὲ Φαραώ, καὶ ἦν ἐνύπνιον. Ἐγένετο δὲ πρωΐ, καὶ ἐταράχθη ἡ ψυχὴ αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἀποστείλας, ἐκάλεσε πάντας τοὺς ἐξηγητὰς Αἰγύπτου καὶ πάντας τοὺς σοφοὺς αὐτῆς, καὶ διηγήσατο αὐτοῖς Φαραὼ τὸ ἐνύπνιον αὐτοῦ· καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ ἀπαγγέλλων αὐτὸ τῷ Φαραώ.
9 Καὶ ἐλάλησεν ὁ ἀρχιοινοχός πρὸς Φαραώ, λέγων· τὴν
10 ἁμαρτίαν μου ἀναμιμνήσκω σήμερον. Φαραὼ ὠργίσθη τοῖς παισὶν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔθετο ἡμᾶς ἐν φυλακῇ, ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ ἀρχιμαγείρου,
11 ἐμέ τε καὶ τὸν ἀρχισιτοποιόν. Καὶ ἔδομεν ἐνύπνιον ἐν νυκτὶ μιᾷ,
12 ἐγὼ καὶ αὐτός· ἕκαστος κατὰ τὸ αὑτοῦ ἐνύπνιον ἔδομεν. Ἦν δὲ ἐκεῖ μεθ᾽ ἡμῶν νεανίσκος, παῖς Ἑβραῖος τοῦ ἀρχιμαγείρου· καὶ διηγησάμεθα αὐτῷ, καὶ συνέκρινεν ἡμῖν τὰ ἐνύπνια ἡμῶν, ἀνδρὶ κατὰ τὸ ἐνύπνιον αὐτοῦ ἐπέλυσεν.
13 Ἐγενήθη δέ, καθὼς συνέκρινεν ἡμῖν, οὕτω καὶ συνέβη, ἐμέ τε ἀποκατασταθῆναι ἐπὶ τὴν ἀρχήν μου, ἐκεῖνον δὲ κρεμασθῆναι.
14 Ἀποστείλας δὲ Φαραώ, ἐκάλεσε τὸν Ἰωσήφ· καὶ ἐξήγαγον αὐτὸν ἐκ τοῦ ὀχυρώματος, καὶ ἐξύρησαν αὐτόν, καὶ ἤλλαξαν τὴν στολὴν αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἦλθε πρὸς Φαραώ.
15 Εἶπε δὲ Φαραὼ τῷ Ἰωσήφ· ἐνύπνιον ἑώρακα, καὶ ὁ συγκρίνων αὐτὸ οὐκ ἔστιν· ἐγὼ δὲ ἀκήκοα περὶ σοῦ λεγόντων, ἀκούσαντά σε

23 just as Joseph did interpret unto them. Nevertheless, the chief cupbearer did not call Joseph to mind, but rather forgot him.

### Chapter 41

1 And it came to pass, after two years of days, that Pharaoh had seen a dream.
2 He thought he stood by the river; and behold, as it were, out of the river there did come up seven cows, beautiful in appearance, and choice in flesh; and
3 they pastured in the Achi. But other seven cows did come up after these out of the river, ugly in appearance, and thin in flesh; and they pastured beside the [other] cows, by the bank of the river (in the Achi).
4 And the seven cows, ugly in appearance and thin in flesh, did devour the seven cows, beautiful in appearance and choice.
5 Then Pharaoh awoke. And he dreamed the second time; and behold, seven ears of grain did come up upon one stalk, choice and beautiful.
6 But other seven ears of grain, thin and wind-scorched, did spring up after them.
7 And the seven thin (and wind-scorched) ears of grain did devour the seven choice and full ears of grain.
8 Then Pharaoh awoke, and it was a dream. And it came to pass in the morning, that his spirit was troubled; and having sent [forth], he called all the interpreters of Egypt and all her wise men; and Pharaoh recounted his dream to them; and there was none to interpret it unto Pharaoh.
9 Then spake the chief cupbearer unto Pharaoh, saying, "My fault I remember this day.
10 Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put us in custody, in the house of the chief cook,
11 both me and the chief baker. And we dreamed a dream in one night,
12 I and he; each man, according to his own dream, we did dream. And there was with us there a young man, a Hebrew servant of the chief cook; and we told him, and he interpreted for us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did solve [the matter].
13 And it came to pass, just as he had interpreted for us, so it also did happen, that I was restored to my office, and that he was hanged."
14 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph; and they brought him forth out of the dungeon, and they shaved him, and they changed his garments; and he came in unto Pharaoh.
15 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, "A dream have I seen, and there is no one who can interpret it; but I have heard concerning you, of those saying, that [when] you hear [a dream]..."
