ΚΕΦ. Ηʹ. Θʹ. ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ
13 τὸν ἔτι. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἑνὶ καὶ ἑξακοσιοστῷ ἔτει ἐν τῇ ζωῇ
τοῦ Νῶε, τοῦ μηνὸς τοῦ πρώτου, μιᾷ τοῦ μηνὸς ἐξέλιπε τὸ ὕδωρ
ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς· καὶ ἀπεκάλυψε Νῶε τὴν στέγην τῆς κιβωτοῦ,
καὶ ἴδεν ὅτι ἐξέλειπε τὸ ὕδωρ ἀπὸ προσώπου τῆς γῆς.
14 Ἐν δὲ τῷ μηνὶ τῷ δευτέρῳ, ἑβδόμῃ καὶ εἰκάδι τοῦ μηνὸς ἐξηράνθη
ἡ γῆ.
15 Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τῷ Νῶε, λέγων·
16 Ἔξελθε ἐκ τῆς κιβωτοῦ σύ, καὶ ἡ γυνή σου, καὶ οἱ υἱοί σου, καὶ αἱ γυ-
ναῖκες τῶν υἱῶν σου μετὰ σοῦ,
17 καὶ πάντα τὰ θηρία ὅσα ἐστὶ μετὰ σοῦ, καὶ πᾶσα σὰρξ ἀπὸ πετεινῶν
ἕως κτηνῶν, καὶ πᾶν ἑρπετὸν κινούμενον ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς· ἐξάγαγε
μετὰ σοῦ· καὶ αὐξάνεσθε καὶ πληθύνεσθε ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, καὶ πληρώσατε
τὴν γῆν.
18 Καὶ ἐξῆλθε Νῶε, καὶ ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ, καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ αἱ γυνά-
κες τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ·
19 καὶ πάντα τὰ θηρία, καὶ πάντα τὰ κτήνη, καὶ πᾶν πετεινόν, καὶ πᾶν
ἑρπετὸν κινούμενον ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς κατὰ γένος αὐτῶν, ἐξῆλθον ἐκ τῆς κιβωτοῦ.
20 Καὶ ᾠκοδόμησε Νῶε θυσιαστήριον τῷ Κυρίῳ· καὶ ἔλαβεν ἀπὸ πάντων
τῶν κτηνῶν τῶν καθαρῶν καὶ ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν πετεινῶν τῶν
καθαρῶν, καὶ ἀνήνεγκεν ὁλοκάρπωσιν ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον.
21 Καὶ ὡσφράνθη Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὀσμὴν εὐωδίας, καὶ εἶπε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς
διανοηθείς· οὐ προσθήσω ἔτι τοῦ καταράσασθαι τὴν γῆν διὰ τὰ
ἔργα τῶν ἀνθρώπων, ὅτι ἔγκειται ἡ διάνοια τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ἐπι-
μελῶς ἐπὶ τὰ πονηρὰ ἐκ νεότητος αὐτοῦ· οὐ προσθήσω οὖν ἔτι
καταξαι πᾶσαν σάρκα ζῶσαν, καθὼς ἐποίησα.
22 Πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς γῆς σπέρμα καὶ θερισμός, ψύχος καὶ καῦμα,
θέρος καὶ ἔαρ, ἡμέραν καὶ νύκτα οὐ καταπαύσουσι.

ΚΕΦ. Θʹ.
1 ΚΑΙ ηὐλόγησεν ὁ Θεὸς τὸν Νῶε καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ, καὶ
εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· αὐξάνεσθε καὶ πληθύνεσθε, καὶ πληρώσατε τὴν γῆν,
καὶ κατακυριεύσατε αὐτῆς.
2 Καὶ ὁ τρόμος ὑμῶν καὶ ὁ φόβος ἔσται ἐπὶ πᾶσι τοῖς θηρίοις
τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἐπὶ πάντα τὰ ὄρνεα τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ ἐπὶ πάντα τὰ κινούμενα
ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἐπὶ πάντας τοὺς ἰχθύας τῆς θαλάσσης· ὑπὸ χεῖρας
ὑμῖν δέδωκα.
3 Καὶ πᾶν ἑρπετόν, ὅ ἐστι ζῶν, ὑμῖν ἔσται εἰς βρῶσιν· ὡς λάχανα
χόρτου. Ἔδωκα ὑμῖν τὰ πάντα.
4 Πλὴν κρέας ἐν αἵματι ψυχῆς οὐ φάγεσθε.

**GENESIS**

**Chapter 8**

^13 him yet. And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year of Noah’s life,
in the first month, on the first day of the month, that the waters had
dried from off the earth; and Noah uncovered the roof of the ark,
and he beheld that the waters had dried from the face of the earth.
^14 And in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month,
the earth was made dry.

^15 Then the Lord God spake unto Noah, saying,
^16 "Go forth from the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and the wives
of thy sons with thee,
^17 and all the beasts that are with thee, and all flesh, from fowl
unto cattle, and every creeping thing that moveth upon the earth; bring them forth
with thee; and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth, and fill
the earth."
^18 So Noah went forth, and his wife, and his sons, and the wives
of his sons with him;
^19 and all the beasts, and all the cattle, and every fowl, and every
creeping thing that moveth upon the earth, according to their kinds, went forth from the ark.

^20 And Noah built an altar unto the Lord; and he took of all
the clean cattle and of all the clean fowls,
and he offered burnt offerings upon the altar.
^21 And the Lord God smelled the savor of a sweet fragrance, and the Lord God said,
having considered [it in His heart]: "I will not again add [to My works] to curse the earth
because of the deeds of men, for the mind of man is
diligently inclined unto evil from his youth; therefore I will not again
destroy by fire all living flesh, as I have done."
^22 "All the days of the earth, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat,
summer and spring, day and night shall not cease."

**Chapter 9**

^1 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and
He said unto them: "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth,
and have dominion over it.
^2 And the dread of you and the fear of you shall be upon all the beasts
of the earth, and upon all the fowls of the heaven, and upon all things that move
upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hands
have I delivered them.
^3 And every creeping thing that is alive shall be for you as meat;
as the green herbs [of the field]. I have given you all things.
^4 But flesh with the blood of its life shall ye not eat."
