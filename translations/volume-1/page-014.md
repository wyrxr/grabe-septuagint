γραμμένων, ὅπως τοῖς ἐκδοθησομένοις τῷ τύπῳ ἐφεστηκότες
προσέχωσι μήτι λάθος καὶ ἀκουσίως γε παρεισδύσῃ.
Ἡμεῖς δὲ τῇ ἐντολῇ τῆς Συνόδου, ᾗ ἔδει, πειθόμενοι, καὶ
συνελθόντες καὶ συνδιασκεψάμενοι ἔγνωμεν ἀπὸ τῶν ἀρχαιο-
τάτων τῆς θείας Γραφῆς βιβλίων τὴν ἀρχὴν ποιήσασθαι, φα-
μὲν δὴ τῆς τοῦ Μωϋσέως Πεντατεύχου, καὶ τῆς τοῦ Ἰησοῦ
τοῦ Ναυὴ βίβλου καὶ τῶν Κριτῶν καὶ τῆς Ῥοὐθ, ἐφεξῆς δὲ
καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ ἄλλα κατὰ τὴν ἐν αὐτοῖς ἐπικρατοῦσαν τάξιν χω-
ρῆσαι, καὶ τὸ ὅλον εἰς τέσσαρας διελεῖν τόμους ὡς εὐχερέ-
στερον, καὶ σχῆμα δὲ καὶ μέγεθος ὥρισται τὸ ἀνὰ χεῖρας.
Κείμενον δὲ προειλόμεθα, συνευδοκούσης τῆς ἱερᾶς Συνόδου,
τὸ κατὰ τὸν ἀλεξανδρινὸν Κώδηκα, οὐ μόνον ὡς σύνηθες ἐκ
τοῦ παλαιοῦ ἀναγινώσκεσθαι αὐτὸ ἐν τῇ Ἐκκλησίᾳ, ἀλλὰ καὶ
ὡς οὐ πάνυ πρὸ πολλοῦ ἐκδοθὲν τὸ αὐτὸ ἐν Μόσχᾳ ἐγκρίσει
τῆς κατὰ τὴν ὀρθόδοξον Ῥωσσίαν ἱερᾶς Συνόδου, καὶ δαπάνῃ
τῶν ἀοιδίμων ἀδελφῶν Ζωσιμάδων, ὧν ἡ μνήμη ἔσται εἰς
αἰῶνα. Πρὸς τοῦτο δὴ προυργιαίτατον ἡμῖν ἐγένετο τοῦ ἀσφα-
λοῦς προνοουμένοις παραβάλλειν ἀεὶ τὸ τυπούμενον καὶ ἐπι-
μελῶς μέχρι κεραίας διορθοῦν. Καὶ ἔχεις ἤδη, ὦ φιλόθεε,
τὰ θεῖα ταῦτα λόγια γνήσια τε καὶ ἀκίβδηλα, ἀναλώμασι
μὲν ἀδροῖς, τῆς ἐν Ἀγγλίᾳ εἰρημένης Ἑταιρίας, ἐπιμε-
λείᾳ δὲ τῶν ὑποφαινομένων, μᾶλλον δὲ τῆς ἐντειλαμένης
ἡμῖν τοῦτο ἱερᾶς Συνόδου τοῦ βασιλείου τῆς Ἑλλάδος, ἢ τινὲ
καὶ πρὸς μείζω ἀσφάλειαν, μὴ λάθοι τις παραποίησις γενομέ-
νη, ἔδοξε τῇ ἑαυτῆς σφραγίδι πάντα ἐπισημήνασθαι τὰ ἀντί-
τυπα. Διὸ καὶ θαῤῥούντως ἀποδεξάμενος, καὶ τοῖς δωρουμένοις
εὐγνωμονῶν, ἀρύου αὐτόθεν τὰ τῆς θεογνωσίας ψυχοσωτήρια
νάματα, καὶ ἄρδευε δαψιλῶς τὴν σὴν ψυχὴν, ἵνα μᾶλλον καὶ
θᾶσσον τὸν τῆς ἐν Χριστῷ τῷ Θεῷ καὶ Σωτῆρι εὐσεβείας

**Highly Literary Translation:**

of these written [ordinances], that those who oversee the forthcoming publication by the press may give heed, lest any error, even if unwitting, should creep in.

But we, obeying the command of the Synod, as was meet, and having gathered and deliberated together, have resolved to commence from the most ancient books of the Holy Scripture; to wit, from the Pentateuch of Moses, and the book of Joshua the son of Nun, and of the Judges, and of Ruth; and thereafter to proceed unto the others according to the order prevailing among them, and to divide the whole into four volumes, as being more convenient; and the form and size of this present [work] have been determined.

And the text we have chosen, with the Holy Synod also assenting, is that according to the Alexandrian Codex, not only because it hath been customary of old for it to be read in the Church, but also because the selfsame [text] was published not long aforetime in Moscow by the approval of the Holy Synod throughout Orthodox Russia, and at the expense of the ever-memorable brethren Zosimas, whose memory shall be unto the ages. For this cause, it became most needful for us, who took thought for the safety [of the text], always to compare that which was being printed, and diligently to correct it even to a tittle.

And now thou hast, O lover of God, these divine oracles, both genuine and unadulterated, [published] at great cost by the aforesaid Society in England, and by the diligence of the undersigned, or rather, of the Holy Synod of the Kingdom of Greece, which did command this unto us; or for certain [reasons], and for greater assurance, lest any falsification should be made by oversight, it seemed good to affix its own seal upon all the copies. Wherefore, having received [this gift] with confidence, and being grateful unto those who have bestowed it, draw thou thence the soul-saving streams of the knowledge of God, and water thy soul abundantly, that thou mayest the more and the sooner [bear] the [fruit] of that godliness which is in Christ God and Savior.
