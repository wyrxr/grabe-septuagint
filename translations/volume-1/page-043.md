30 ἐὰν λαλήσω· ἐὰν δὲ εὑρεθῶσιν ἐκεῖ τριάκοντα; Καὶ εἶπεν· οὐ μὴ
31 ἀπολέσω, ἐὰν εὑρεθῶσιν ἐκεῖ τριάκοντα. Καὶ εἶπεν· ἐπειδὴ ἔχω
   λαλῆσαι πρὸς τὸν Κύριον, ἐὰν δὲ εὑρεθῶσιν ἐκεῖ εἴκοσι; Καὶ εἶ-
32 πεν· οὐ μὴ ἀπολέσω ἕνεκεν τῶν εἴκοσι; Καὶ εἶπε· μή τι Κύριε,
   ἐὰν λαλήσω ἔτι ἅπαξ· ἐὰν δὲ εὑρεθῶσιν ἐκεῖ δέκα; Καὶ εἶπεν· οὐ
33 μὴ ἀπολέσω ἕνεκεν τῶν δέκα. Ἀπῆλθε δὲ Κύριος, ὡς ἐπαύσατο
   λαλῶν τῷ Ἀβραάμ· καὶ Ἀβραὰμ ἀπέστρεψεν εἰς τὸν τόπον αὐτοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΘʹ. ΧΙΧ.

1 Ἦλθον δὲ οἱ δύο ἄγγελοι εἰς Σόδομα ἑσπέρας· Λὼτ δὲ
   ἐκάθητο παρὰ τὴν πύλην Σοδόμων. Ἰδὼν δὲ Λὼτ, ἀνέστη εἰς
   συνάντησιν αὐτοῖς, καὶ προσεκύνησε τῷ προσώπῳ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν,
2 καὶ εἶπεν· Ἰδοὺ κύριοι, ἐκκλίνατε πρὸς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ παιδὸς ὑμῶν,
   καὶ καταλύσατε, καὶ νίψατε τοὺς πόδας ὑμῶν, καὶ ὀρθρίσαντες
   ἀπελεύσεσθε εἰς τὴν ὁδὸν ὑμῶν. Εἶπαν δέ· οὐχὶ, ἀλλ’ ἢ ἐν τῇ
3 πλατείᾳ καταλύσομεν. Καὶ παρεβιάζετο αὐτοὺς, καὶ ἐξέκλιναν πρὸς
   αὐτὸν, καὶ εἰσῆλθον εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐποίησεν αὐτοῖς πό-
4 τον, καὶ ἀζύμους ἔπεψεν αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἔφαγον. Πρὸ τοῦ κοιμηθῆ-
   ναι, καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες τῆς πόλεως οἱ Σοδομῖται περιεκύκλωσαν τὴν
5 οἰκίαν ἀπὸ νεανίσκου ἕως πρεσβυτέρου, ἅπας ὁ λαὸς ἅμα. Καὶ
   ἐξεκαλοῦντο τὸν Λὼτ, καὶ ἔλεγον πρὸς αὐτόν· ποῦ εἰσιν οἱ ἄν-
   δρες οἱ εἰσελθόντες πρὸς σὲ τὴν νύκτα; ἐξάγαγε αὐτοὺς πρὸς
6 ἡμᾶς, ἵνα συγγενώμεθα αὐτοῖς. Ἐξῆλθε δὲ Λὼτ πρὸς αὐτοὺς πρὸς
7 τὸ πρόθυρον, καὶ τὴν θύραν προσέρωξεν ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ. Εἶπε δὲ πρὸς
8 αὐτούς· μηδαμῶς ἀδελφοὶ, μὴ πονηρεύσησθε. Εἰσὶ δέ μοι δύο θυ-
   γατέρες, αἳ οὐκ ἔγνωσαν ἄνδρα· ἐξάξω αὐτὰς πρὸς ὑμᾶς, καὶ χρή-
9 σασθε αὐταῖς, καθὰ ἀρέσκῃ ὑμῖν· μόνον εἰς τοὺς ἄνδρας τούτους
   μὴ ποιήσητε μηδὲν ἄδικον, οὗ εἵνεκεν εἰσῆλθον ὑπὸ τὴν σκέπην
   τῶν δοκῶν μου. Εἶπαν δέ· ἀπόστα ἐκεῖ· εἰσῆλθες παροικεῖν, μὴ
   καὶ κρίσιν κρῖναι; νῦν οὖν σε κακώσομεν μᾶλλον ἢ ἐκείνους. Καὶ
   παρεβιάζοντο τὸν ἄνδρα τὸν Λὼτ σφόδρα, καὶ ἤγγισαν συντρῖψαι
10 τὴν θύραν. Ἐκτείναντες δὲ οἱ ἄνδρες τὰς χεῖρας, εἰσεσπάσαντο
   τὸν Λὼτ πρὸς ἑαυτοὺς εἰς τὸν οἶκον, καὶ τὴν θύραν τοῦ οἴκου
11 ἀπέκλεισαν· τοὺς δὲ ἄνδρας τοὺς ὄντας ἐπὶ τῆς θύρας τοῦ οἴκου,
   ἐπάταξαν ἐν ἀορασίᾳ, ἀπὸ μικροῦ ἕως μεγάλου· καὶ παρελύθη-

### Translation

**Genesis Chapter 18**

30 [If] I speak; if peradventure there be found there thirty? And He said, I will not destroy [it], if there be found there thirty.
31 And he said, Since I have [again] taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: if peradventure there be found there twenty? And He said,
32 [I] will not destroy [it] for the twenty's sake? And he said, Oh, let not the Lord be angry, if I speak yet once more; if peradventure there be found there ten? And He said, I will not destroy [it] for the ten's sake.
33 And the Lord departed, as soon as He had ceased speaking with Abraham; and Abraham returned unto his own place.

**Chapter 19**

1 And there came the two angels unto Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom. And when Lot saw them, he rose up to meet them, and bowed himself with his face unto the ground,
2 and said, Behold, my lords, turn aside, I pray you, into the house of your servant, and lodge [there], and wash your feet; and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. But they said, Nay, but [rather] in the street will we lodge.
3 And he pressed them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread for them, and they did eat.
4 But before they lay down to sleep, the men of the city, [even] the Sodomites, did compass the house round about,
5 from young man even unto old, all the people together. And they called out unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men
6 who came in to thee this night? Bring them out unto us, that we may know them. And Lot went out unto them to [the]
7 threshold, and bolted the door behind him. And he said unto
8 them, By no means, my brethren, do not act so wickedly. Behold now, I have two daughters, who have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them
9 as it pleases you; only unto these men do ye no unjust thing, for for this cause came they under the shelter of my roof. But they said, Stand back there! Didst thou come in to sojourn, and [wilt thou] also judge judgement? Now therefore will we deal worse with thee than with them. And they pressed hard upon the man, [even] Lot, most exceedingly, and drew near to break down
10 the door. But the men stretched forth their hands, and pulled Lot in to themselves into the house, and shut the door of the house.
11 But the men who were at the door of the house, they struck with blindness, both small and great; and they were wearied
