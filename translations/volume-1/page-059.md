**ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ ΚΕΦ. Κς΄.**

[21] Ἀπάρας δὲ ᾿Ισαὰκ ἐκεῖθεν, ὤρυξε φρέαρ ἕτερον· ἐκρίνοντο δὲ καὶ περὶ ἐκείνου·
22 καὶ ἐπωνόμασε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ, ᾿Εχθρία. ᾿Απάρας δὲ ἐκεῖθεν, ὤρυξε φρέαρ ἕτερον, καὶ οὐκ ἐμαχέσαντο περὶ αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐπωνόμασε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ, Εὐρυχωρία, λέγων· διότι νῦν ἐπλάτυνε Κύριος ἡμῖν, καὶ ηὔξησεν ἡμᾶς ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς.
23 ᾿Ανέβη δὲ ἐκεῖθεν ἐπὶ τὸ φρέαρ τοῦ ὅρκου.
24 Καὶ ὤφθη αὐτῷ Κύριος ἐν τῇ νυκτὶ ἐκείνῃ, καὶ εἶπεν· ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ Θεὸς ᾿Αβραὰμ τοῦ πατρός σου, μὴ φοβοῦ· μετὰ σοῦ γάρ εἰμι, καὶ εὐλογήσω σε, καὶ πληθυνῶ τὸ σπέρμα σου διὰ ᾿Αβραὰμ τὸν πατέρα σου.
25 Καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν ἐκεῖ θυσιαστήριον, καὶ ἐπεκαλέσατο τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου, καὶ ἔπηξεν ἐκεῖ τὴν σκηνὴν αὐτοῦ· ὤρυξαν δὲ ἐκεῖ οἱ παῖδες ᾿Ισαὰκ φρέαρ.
26 Καὶ ᾿Αβιμέλεχ ἐπορεύθη πρὸς αὐτὸν ἀπὸ Γεράρων, καὶ ᾿Οχοζὰθ ὁ νυμφαγωγὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ Φιχὸλ ὁ ἀρχιστράτηγος τῆς δυνάμεως αὐτοῦ.
27 Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς ᾿Ισαάκ· ἵνα τί ἤλθατε πρός με; ὑμεῖς δὲ ἐμισήσατέ με, καὶ ἀπεστείλατέ με ἀφ᾿ ὑμῶν.
28 Καὶ εἶπαν· ἰδόντες ἑωράκαμεν, ὅτι ἦν Κύριος μετὰ σοῦ, καὶ εἴπαμεν· γενέσθω ἀρὰ ἀνὰ μέσον ἡμῶν καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον σου, καὶ διαθησόμεθα μετὰ σοῦ διαθήκην, μὴ ποιήσειν μεθ᾿ ἡμῶν κακά, καθότι ἡμεῖς
29 σε οὐκ ἐβδελυξάμεθα, καὶ ὃν τρόπον ἐχρησάμεθά σοι καλῶς, καὶ ἐξαπεστείλαμέν σε μετ᾿ εἰρήνης· καὶ νῦν σὺ εὐλογητὸς ὑπὸ Κυρίου.
30 Καὶ ἐποίησεν αὐτοῖς δοχήν, καὶ ἔφαγον, καὶ ἔπιον.
31 Καὶ ἀναστάντες τὸ πρωΐ, ὤμοσαν ἄνθρωπος τῷ πλησίον αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν αὐτοὺς ᾿Ισαάκ, καὶ ἀπώχοντο ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ μετὰ σωτηρίας.
32 ᾿Εγένετο δὲ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, καὶ παραγενόμενοι οἱ παῖδες ᾿Ισαὰκ ἀπήγγειλαν αὐτῷ περὶ τοῦ φρέατος οὗ ὤρυξαν, καὶ
33 εἶπαν· οὐχ εὕρομεν ὕδωρ. Καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ, ῎Ορκος· διὰ τοῦτο ἐκάλεσε τὸ ὄνομα τῇ πόλει, Φρέαρ ὅρκου, ἕως τῆς σήμερον ἡμέρας.
34 Ἦν δὲ ᾿Ησαῦ ἐτῶν τεσσαράκοντα, καὶ ἔλαβε γυναῖκα ᾿Ιουδίθ, θυγατέρα Βεὴρ τοῦ Χετταίου, καὶ τὴν Μασεμμάθ, θυγατέρα Αἰλὼν τοῦ Εὐαίου·
35 καὶ ἦσαν ἐρίζουσαι τῷ ᾿Ισαάκ, καὶ τῇ ῾Ρεβέκκᾳ.

**ΚΕΦ. ΚΖ΄. XXVII.**

1 ᾿Εγένετο δὲ μετὰ τὸ γηράσαι ᾿Ισαάκ, καὶ ἠμβλύνθησαν οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτοῦ τοῦ δρᾶν· καὶ ἐκάλεσεν ᾿Ησαῦ τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ τὸν πρεσβύτερον, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· υἱέ μου. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· ἰδοὺ

**GENESIS CHAPTER 26**

21 Now Isaac departed from thence, and he dug another well; and they contended concerning that one also.
22 And he named the well, Enmity. Then he departed from thence, and dug another well, and they did not contend over it; and he named the well, Spaciousness, saying: "Because now hath the Lord made room for us, and hath made us fruitful upon the earth."
23 And he went up from thence to the Well of the Oath.
24 And the Lord appeared unto him in that night, and said: "I am the God of Abraham thy father. Fear not, for I am with thee, and I will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for Abraham thy father's sake."
25 And he built there an altar, and called upon the name of the Lord, and pitched his tent there; and the servants of Isaac dug a well there.
26 And Abimelech went unto him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his chief friend, and Phicol the commander of his forces.
27 And Isaac said unto them: "Wherefore are ye come unto me, seeing ye hated me, and sent me away from you?"
28 And they said: "We have seen assuredly that the Lord was with thee; therefore we said, Let there now be an oath betwixt us and betwixt thee, and let us make a covenant with thee, that thou shalt do us no harm; forasmuch as we
29 did not detest thee, and as we have dealt well with thee, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now blessed of the Lord."
30 And he made them a feast, and they ate and drank.
31 And rising up early in the morning, they swore one to another; and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in safety.
32 And it came to pass on that same day, that the servants of Isaac came and told him concerning the well which they had dug, and
33 said: "We have not found water." And he named the well, Oath. Therefore he called the name of the city, The Well of the Oath, unto this day.
34 Now Esau was forty years old when he took a wife, Judith, the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Masemmath, the daughter of Elon the Hivite;
35 and they were a grief unto Isaac and Rebekah.

**CHAPTER 27**

1 And it came to pass, when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dimmed from seeing, that he called Esau his elder son, and said unto him: "My son." And he answered him: "[Here] am I."
