**Original Text with light OCR corrections:**
6 υἱοὶ τῶν ἀνθρώπων. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος· ἰδοὺ γένος ἓν, καὶ χεῖλος ἓν πάντων, καὶ τοῦτο ἤρξαντο ποιῆσαι· καὶ νῦν οὐκ ἐκλείψει ἐξ αὐτῶν πάντα, ὅσα ἂν ἐπιθῶνται ποιῆσαι.
7 Δεῦτε, καὶ καταβάντες συγχέωμεν ἐκεῖ αὐτῶν τὴν γλῶσσαν, ἵνα μὴ ἀκούσωσιν ἕκαστος τὴν φωνὴν τοῦ πλησίον.
8 Καὶ διέσπειρεν αὐτοὺς Κύριος· ἐκεῖθεν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον πάσης τῆς γῆς· καὶ ἐπαύσαντο οἰκοδομοῦντες τὴν πόλιν καὶ τὸν πύργον.
9 Διὰ τοῦτο ἐκλήθη τὸ ὄνομα αὐτῆς, Σύγχυσις· ὅτι ἐκεῖ συνέχεε Κύριος τὰ χείλη πάσης τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἐκεῖθεν διέσπειρεν αὐτοὺς Κύριος (ὁ Θεὸς) ἐπὶ πρόσωπον πάσης τῆς γῆς.
