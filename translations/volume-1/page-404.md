15 αὐτῷ ἐστιν ἀπὸ τῆς πόλεως ὀπίσω. Καὶ ἴδε, καὶ ἀνεχώρησεν Ἰη-
    σοῦς καὶ πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔφυγεν ὁδὸν τῆς
    ἐρήμου.
16 Καὶ ἐνίσχυσε πᾶς ὁ λαὸς τῆς Γαΐ, τοῦ καταδιῶξαι ὀπί-
    σω αὐτῶν, καὶ κατεδίωξαν ὀπίσω τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ αὐτοὶ
    ἀπέστησαν ἀπὸ τῆς πόλεως·
17 οὐ κατελείφθη οὐδεὶς ἐν τῇ Γαΐ καὶ
    ἐν Βαιθὴλ, ὃς οὐ κατεδίωξεν ὀπίσω Ἰσραήλ, καὶ κατέλιπον ἠνεωγ-
    μένην, καὶ κατεδίωξαν ὀπίσω Ἰσραήλ.
18 Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Ἰη-
    σοῦν· Ἔκτεινον τὴν χεῖρά σου ἐν τῷ γαισῷ τῷ ἐν τῇ χειρί σου
    ἐπὶ τὴν πόλιν, ὅτι εἰς τὴν χεῖρά σου παραδέδωκα αὐτήν· καὶ τὰ
    ἔνεδρα ἐξαναστήσονται ἐν τάχει ἐκ τοῦ τόπου αὐτῶν.
19 Καὶ ἐξέ-
    τεινεν Ἰησοῦς τὸν γαισὸν καὶ τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν πόλιν· καὶ
    τὰ ἔνεδρα ἐξανέστησαν ἐν τάχει ἐκ τοῦ τόπου αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐξῆλ-
    θοσαν, ὅτε ἐξέτεινε τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἰσῆλθον εἰς τὴν πόλιν,
    καὶ κατελάβοντο αὐτήν· καὶ σπεύσαντες ἐνέπρησαν τὴν πόλιν ἐν
    πυρί.
20 Καὶ περιβλέψαντες οἱ κατοικοῦντες Γαΐ εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω αὐ-
    τῶν, ἑώρων ἀναβαίνοντα τὸν καπνὸν τῆς πόλεως εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν,
    καὶ οὐκέτι εἶχον ποῦ φύγωσιν, ὧδε ἢ ὧδε· καὶ ὁ λαὸς ὁ φεύγων
    εἰς τὴν ἔρημον, ἐστράφησαν ἐπὶ τοὺς διώκοντας.
21 Καὶ Ἰησοῦς καὶ
    πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ εἶδον, ὅτι ἔλαβον τὰ ἔνεδρα τὴν πόλιν, καὶ ἔτι ἀ-
    νέβη ὁ καπνὸς τῆς πόλεως εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν· καὶ μεταβαλλόμενοι
    ἐπάταξαν τοὺς ἄνδρας τῆς Γαΐ.
22 Καὶ οὗτοι ἐξῆλθον ἐκ τῆς πό-
    λεως εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐγενήθησαν ἀναμέσον τῆς παρεμ-
    βολῆς, οὗτοι ἐντεῦθεν καὶ οὗτοι ἐντεῦθεν· καὶ ἐπάταξαν αὐτοὺς,
    ἕως τοῦ μὴ καταλειφθῆναι αὐτῶν σεσωσμένον καὶ διαπεφευγότα·
23 καὶ τὸν βασιλέα τῆς Γαΐ συνέλαβον ζῶντα, καὶ προσήγαγον αὐτὸν
    πρὸς Ἰησοῦν.
24 Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἐπαύσαντο οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἀπο-
    κτείνοντες πάντας τοὺς ἐκ τῆς Γαΐ τοὺς ἐν τοῖς πεδίοις, καὶ ἐν
    τῷ ὄρει τῆς καταβάσεως, οὐ κατεδίωξαν αὐτοὺς ἐπ’ αὐτῆς, καὶ
    ἔπεσον πάντες ἐν στόματι ῥομφαίας ἕως εἰς τέλος, καὶ ἐπέστρε-
    ψεν Ἰησοῦς εἰς Γαΐ, καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτὴν ἐν στόματι ῥομφαίας.
25 Καὶ ἐγενήθησαν πάντες οἱ πεσόντες ἐν τῇ ἡμέρα ἐκείνῃ ἀπὸ ἀν-
    δρὸς καὶ ἕως γυναικὸς δώδεκα χιλιάδες, πάντας τοὺς κατοικοῦν-
    τας Γαΐ.
26 Καὶ Ἰησοῦς οὐκ ἐπέστρεψε χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἣν ἐξέτεινεν
    ἐν τῷ γαισῷ, ἕως ἀνεθεμάτισε πάντας τοὺς κατοικοῦντας Γαΐ.
27 Πλὴν τῶν κτηνῶν καὶ τῶν σκύλων τῶν ἐν τῇ πόλει ἐκείνῃ ἐπρο-
    νόμευσαν ἑαυτοῖς οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ κατὰ πρόσταγμα Κυρίου, ὃν

**Joshua 8**
15 ...[was set] for him from behind the city. And behold, Joshua and all Israel withdrew from before their face, and fled by the way of the wilderness.
16 And all the people of Ai mustered themselves to pursue after them, and they pursued after the sons of Israel; and these [the men of Ai] departed from the city.
17 And there was not one left in Ai and in Bethel who did not pursue after Israel; and they left [the cities] open, and pursued after Israel.
18 Then said the Lord unto Joshua, "Stretch out thy hand with the javelin that is in thy hand toward the city, for into thy hand have I delivered it; and the ambush shall rise up quickly from their place."
19 And Joshua stretched out the javelin and his hand toward the city. And the ambush rose up quickly from their place, and they went forth when he stretched out his hand, and entered into the city, and took it; and hastening, they set the city on fire with fire.
20 And the inhabitants of Ai, looking behind them, saw the smoke of the city ascending to the heaven, and they no longer had [a place] whither they might flee, hither or thither; and the people that fled into the wilderness turned upon their pursuers.
21 And Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that yet the smoke of the city ascended to the heaven; and turning about, they smote the men of Ai.
22 And these [the ambushers] came forth from the city to meet them, and they were in the midst of the camp, these on this side and these on that side; and they smote them until none of them was left, neither saved nor escaped.
23 And they captured the king of Ai alive, and brought him unto Joshua.
24 And it came to pass, when the sons of Israel had ceased slaying all those of Ai in the plains, and on the mountain of the descent, and had not pursued them further upon it, and all had fallen by the mouth of the sword until their utter end, that Joshua returned unto Ai, and smote it with the mouth of the sword.
25 And all that fell in that day, both man and woman, were twelve thousand, even all the inhabitants of Ai.
26 And Joshua did not withdraw his hand, which he had stretched out with the javelin, until he had devoted all the inhabitants of Ai to utter destruction.
27 Save only the cattle and the spoils that were in that city, these did the sons of Israel plunder for themselves, according to the commandment of the Lord, which...
