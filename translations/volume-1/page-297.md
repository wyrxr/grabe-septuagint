παραβολὴν αὐτοῦ, εἶπεν· ἰσχυρὰ ἡ κατοικία σου, καὶ ἐὰν θῇς ἐν
22 πέτρᾳ τὴν νοσσιάν σου, καὶ ἐὰν γένηται τῷ Βεὼρ νοσσιὰ πανουρ-
23 γίας, Ἀσσύριοι αἰχμαλωτεύσουσι σε. (Καὶ ἰδὼν τὸν Ὤγ), καὶ
ἀναλαβὼν τὴν παραβολὴν αὐτοῦ, εἶπεν· ὢ ὢ, τίς ζήσεται, ὅταν
24 θῇ ταῦτα ὁ Θεός; καὶ ἐξελεύσονται ἐκ χειρῶν Κητικῶν, καὶ κα-
κώσουσι Ἀσσοὺρ, καὶ κακώσουσιν Ἑβραίους, καὶ αὐτοὶ ὁμοθυ-
25 μαδὸν ἀπολοῦνται. Καὶ ἀναστὰς Βαλαὰμ ἀπῆλθεν, ἀποστραφεὶς
εἰς τὸν τόπον αὐτοῦ· καὶ Βαλὰκ ἀπῆλθε πρὸς ἑαυτόν.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΕ΄. XXV.

1 ΚΑΙ κατέλυσεν Ἰσραὴλ ἐν Σαττεὶν, καὶ ἐβεβηλώθη ὁ λαὸς
2 ἐκπορνεῦσαι εἰς τὰς θυγατέρας Μωάβ. Καὶ ἐκάλεσαν αὐτοὺς εἰς
τὰς θυσίας τῶν εἰδώλων αὐτῶν· καὶ ἔφαγεν ὁ λαὸς τῶν θυσιῶν
3 αὐτῶν, καὶ προσεκύνησε τοῖς εἰδώλοις αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐτελέσθησαν τῷ
4 Βεελφεγὼρ· καὶ ὠργίσθη θυμῷ Κύριος τῷ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ εἶπε Κύ-
ριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν· λάβε πάντας τοὺς ἀρχηγοὺς τοῦ λαοῦ, καὶ
παραδειγμάτισον αὐτοὺς τῷ Κυρίῳ κατέναντι τοῦ ἡλίου, καὶ
5 ἀποστραφήσεται ὀργὴ θυμοῦ Κυρίου ἀπὸ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ εἶπε Μω-
υσῆς ταῖς φυλαῖς Ἰσραήλ· ἀποκτείνατε ἕκαστος τὸν οἰκεῖον αὐ-
6 τοῦ τὸν τετελεσμένον τῷ Βεελφεγώρ. Καὶ ἰδοὺ ἄνθρωπος τῶν
υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ ἐλθὼν προσήγαγε τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ πρὸς τὴν Μα-
διανίτιν ἔναντι Μωυσῆ, καὶ ἐναντίον πάσης συναγωγῆς υἱῶν Ἰσ-
ραήλ· αὐτοὶ δὲ ἔκλαιον παρὰ τὴν θύραν τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυ-
7 ρίου. Καὶ ἰδὼν Φινεὲς υἱὸς Ἐλεάζαρ υἱοῦ Ἀαρὼν τοῦ ἱερέως,
ἐξανέστη ἐκ μέσου τῆς συναγωγῆς, καὶ λαβὼν σειρομάστην ἐν
8 τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ, εἰσῆλθεν ὀπίσω τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τοῦ Ἰσραηλίτου εἰς
τὴν κάμινον, καὶ ἀπεκέντησεν ἀμφοτέρους, τόν τε ἄνθρωπον τὸν
Ἰσραηλίτην, καὶ τὴν γυναῖκα διὰ τῆς μήτρας αὐτῆς· καὶ ἐπαύ-
9 σατο ἡ πληγὴ ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἐγένοντο οἱ τεθνηκό-
10 τες ἐν τῇ πληγῇ, τέσσαρες καὶ εἴκοσι χιλιάδες. Καὶ ἐλάλησε
11 Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, λέγων· Φινεὲς υἱὸς Ἐλεάζαρ υἱοῦ Ἀαρὼν
τοῦ ἱερέως κατέπαυσε τὸν θυμόν μου ἀπὸ υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τῷ
ζηλῶσαι αὐτὸν μου τὸν ζῆλον ἐν αὐτοῖς, καὶ οὐκ ἐξηνήλωσα τοὺς
12 υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τῷ ζήλῳ μου. Οὕτως εἶπον· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ δίδωμι
13 αὐτῷ τὴν διαθήκην μου, διαθήκην εἰρήνης, καὶ ἔσται αὐτῷ καὶ

**CHAPTER XXIV.**

22 his oracle, saying: "Strong is thy dwelling, and if thou set thy nest in a rock;
    and if for Beor there should be a nest of mischief, the Assyrians shall carry thee captive."
23 (And seeing Og), and taking up his oracle, he said: "Woe! Woe! who shall live
    when God setteth these things?
24 And they shall come forth from the hands of the Kitim, and shall afflict Asshur,
    and shall afflict the Hebrews, and they themselves shall perish together."
25 And Balaam rose up and departed, returning unto his place; and Balak departed to his own.

**CHAPTER XXV.**

1 And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people profaned themselves by committing fornication
    with the daughters of Moab.
2 And they called them unto the sacrifices of their idols; and the people ate of their sacrifices,
    and bowed down to their idols.
3 And they were initiated into Baal-peor; and the Lord was wroth in [His] fierce anger with Israel.
4 And the Lord said unto Moses: "Take all the leaders of the people,
    and make them an example before the Lord in the sight of the sun;
    and the fierce wrath of the Lord shall turn away from Israel."
5 And Moses said unto the tribes of Israel: "Slay ye every man his kinsman
    who hath been initiated into Baal-peor."
6 And behold, a man of the sons of Israel came and brought his brother
    unto the Midianitess before Moses, and before all the congregation of the sons of Israel;
    and they themselves wept at the door of the Tabernacle of Testimony.
7 And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, seeing it,
    rose up from the midst of the congregation, and taking a spear in his hand,
8 he went after the Israelite man into the tent, and pierced through both,
    the Israelite man, and the woman through her womb;
    and the plague ceased from the sons of Israel.
9 And those who died in the plague were twenty and four thousand.
10 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying:
11 "Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest,
    hath turned away My wrath from the sons of Israel,
    in that he was zealous with My zeal among them,
    and I did not consume the sons of Israel in My zeal.
12 Therefore say thou: Behold, I give unto him My covenant, a covenant of peace;
13 And it shall be for him and for his seed after him a covenant of everlasting priesthood,
    because he was zealous for his God, and made atonement for the sons of Israel."
