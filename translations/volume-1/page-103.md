1 ΕΛΘΩΝ δὲ Ἰωσὴφ ἀπήγγειλε τῷ Φαραώ, λέγων· ὁ πατὴρ
μου καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοί μου, καὶ τὰ κτήνη καὶ οἱ βόες αὐτῶν, καὶ
πάντα τὰ αὐτῶν ἦλθον ἐκ γῆς Χαναάν· καὶ ἰδοὺ εἰσιν ἐν γῇ Γε-
2 σέν. Ἀπὸ δὲ τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτοῦ παρέλαβε πέντε ἄνδρας, καὶ ἔ-
3 στησεν αὐτοὺς ἐναντίον Φαραώ. Καὶ εἶπε Φαραὼ τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς
Ἰωσήφ· τί τὸ ἔργον ὑμῶν; Οἱ δὲ εἶπαν τῷ Φαραώ· ποιμένες προ-
βάτων οἱ παῖδές σου, καὶ ἡμεῖς, καὶ οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν (ἐκ) παι-
δίοθεν ἕως τοῦ νῦν. 4 Εἶπαν δὲ τῷ Φαραώ· παροικεῖν ἐν τῇ γῇ
ἥκαμεν· οὐ γάρ ἐστι νομὴ τοῖς κτήνεσι τῶν παίδων σου· ἐνίσχυσε
γὰρ ὁ λιμὸς ἐν γῇ Χαναάν. Νῦν οὖν κατοικήσωμεν οἱ παῖδές σου
ἐν γῇ Γεσέν. 5 Εἶπε δὲ Φαραὼ τῷ Ἰωσήφ· κατοικείτωσαν ἐν γῇ
Γεσέν· εἰ δὲ ἐπίστῃ ὅτι εἰσὶν ἐν αὐτοῖς ἄνδρες δυνατοί, κατάστη-
σον αὐτοὺς ἄρχοντας τῶν ἐμῶν κτηνῶν. Ἦλθον δὲ εἰς Αἴγυπτον
πρὸς Ἰωσὴφ Ἰακὼβ καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἤκουσε Φαραὼ βα-
6 σιλεὺς Αἰγύπτου. Καὶ εἶπε Φαραὼ πρὸς Ἰωσήφ, λέγων· ὁ πατήρ
σου καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοί σου ἥκασι πρός σε· ἰδοὺ ἡ γῆ Αἰγύπτου ἐναν-
τίον σου ἐστίν· ἐν τῇ βελτίστῃ γῇ κατοίκισον τὸν πατέρα σου καὶ
7 τοὺς ἀδελφούς σου. Εἰσήγαγε δὲ Ἰωσὴφ Ἰακὼβ τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ,
καὶ ἔστησεν αὐτὸν ἐναντίον Φαραώ· καὶ εὐλόγησεν Ἰακὼβ τὸν
8 Φαραώ. Εἶπε δὲ Φαραὼ τῷ Ἰακώβ· πόσα ἔτη ἡμερῶν ζωῆς σου;
9 Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰακὼβ τῷ Φαραώ· αἱ ἡμέραι τῶν ἐτῶν τῆς ζωῆς μου,
ἃς παροικῶ, ἑκατὸν τριάκοντα ἔτη· μικραὶ καὶ πονηραὶ γεγόνασιν
αἱ ἡμέραι τῶν ἐτῶν τῆς ζωῆς μου, οὐκ ἀφίκοντο εἰς τὰς ἡμέρας
τῶν ἐτῶν τῆς ζωῆς τῶν πατέρων μου, ἃς ἡμέρας παρῴχησαν.
10 Καὶ εὐλογήσας Ἰακὼβ τὸν Φαραώ, ἐξῆλθεν ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ. 11 Καὶ
κατώκισεν Ἰωσὴφ τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ καὶ τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ, καὶ
ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς κατάσχεσιν ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ, ἐν τῇ βελτίστῃ γῇ, ἐν
12 γῇ Ῥαμεσσῆ, καθὰ προσέταξε Φαραώ. Καὶ ἐσιτομέτρει Ἰωσὴφ
τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς αὐτοῦ, καὶ παντὶ τῷ οἴκῳ
τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ σῖτον κατὰ σῶμα. 13 Σῖτος δὲ οὐκ ἦν ἐν πάσῃ
τῇ γῇ· ἐνίσχυσε γὰρ ὁ λιμὸς σφόδρα· ἐξέλιπε δὲ ἡ γῆ Αἰγύπτου
καὶ ἡ γῆ Χαναὰν ἀπὸ τοῦ λιμοῦ. 14 Συνήγαγε δὲ Ἰωσὴφ πᾶν τὸ
ἀργύριον, τὸ εὑρεθὲν ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ καὶ ἐν γῇ Χαναάν, ἀπὸ τοῦ

### Genesis, Chapter 47

1.  Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, saying, "My father and my brethren, and their flocks and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen."
2.  And from among his brethren, he took five men and presented them before Pharaoh.
3.  Then Pharaoh said unto Joseph's brethren, "What is your occupation?" And they answered Pharaoh, "Thy servants are shepherds of sheep, both we and our fathers, from childhood even until now."
4.  And they said further unto Pharaoh, "We are come to sojourn in this land, for there is no pasture for thy servants' cattle, because the famine is sore in the land of Canaan. Now therefore, let thy servants, we pray thee, dwell in the land of Goshen."
5.  And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, "Let them dwell in the land of Goshen. And if thou knowest that there be amongst them able men, then make them rulers over my cattle." And Jacob and his sons came into Egypt unto Joseph; and Pharaoh, king of Egypt, heard [of their coming].
6.  And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, saying, "Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee; behold, the land of Egypt is before thee. In the best of the land make thy father and thy brethren to dwell."
7.  And Joseph brought in Jacob, his father, and presented him before Pharaoh; and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
8.  And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, "How many are the days of the years of thy life?"
9.  And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, "The days of the years of my sojourning are an hundred and thirty years. Few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and they have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers, during the days they sojourned."
10. And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before him.
11. And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Ramesse, as Pharaoh had commanded.
12. And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household with corn according to the need of each person.
13. Now there was no bread in all the land, for the famine was very sore; and the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.
14. And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, for the [corn they bought from him].
