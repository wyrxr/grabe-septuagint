30 τερου. Καὶ ἀνέστησαν ἑαυτοῖς οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ Δὰν τὸ γλυπτὸν Μει-
    χά· καὶ Ἰωνάθαν υἱὸς Γερσὼμ υἱοῦ Μανασσῆ, αὐτὸς καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ
    αὐτοῦ, ἦσαν ἱερεῖς τῇ φυλῇ Δάν, ἕως τῆς μετοικεσίας τῆς γῆς.
31 Καὶ ἔταξαν αὐτοῖς τὸ γλυπτὸν Μειχὰ ὃ ἐποίησε, πάσας τὰς ἡ-

ΚΕΦ. ΙΘʹ.
1 ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις, καὶ βασιλεὺς οὐκ ἦν
    ἐν Ἰσραήλ· καὶ ἐγένετο ἀνὴρ Λευΐτης παροικῶν ἐν μηροῦ ὄρους
    Ἐφραίμ· καὶ ἔλαβεν ὁ ἀνὴρ ἑαυτῷ γυναῖκα παλλακὴν ἐκ Βηθλε-
2 ἐμ Ἰούδα. Καὶ ὠργίσθη αὐτῷ ἡ παλλακὴ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀπῆλθεν
    ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῆς εἰς Βηθλεὲμ Ἰούδα·
3 καὶ ἐγένετο ἐκεῖ ἡμέρας τετράμηνον. Καὶ ἀνέστη ὁ ἀνὴρ αὐτῆς,
    καὶ ἐπορεύθη κατόπισθεν αὐτῆς, τοῦ λαλῆσαι ἐπὶ τὴν καρδίαν αὐ-
    τῆς, διαλλάξαι αὐτὴν ἑαυτῷ, (καὶ ἐπαγαγεῖν αὐτὴν πάλιν πρὸς
    αὐτόν)· καὶ τὸ παιδάριον αὐτοῦ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ζεῦγος ὑποζυ-
    γίων· καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἕως οἴκου τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῆς, καὶ ἴδεν αὐτὸν
4 ὁ πατὴρ τῆς νεάνιδος, καὶ παρῆν εἰς ἀπάντησιν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἰ-
    σήγαγεν αὐτὸν ὁ γαμβρὸς αὐτοῦ ὁ πατὴρ τῆς νεάνιδος, καὶ ἐκά-
    θισε μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἡμέρας τρεῖς· καὶ ἔφαγον, καὶ ἔπιον, καὶ ὕπνω-
5 σαν ἐκεῖ. Καὶ ἐγένετο τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τετάρτῃ, καὶ ὤρθρισαν
    τοπρωΐ, καὶ ἀνέστη τοῦ ἀπελθεῖν· καὶ εἶπεν ὁ πατὴρ τῆς νεάνι-
    δος πρὸς τὸν γαμβρὸν αὐτοῦ· στήρισον τὴν καρδίαν σου κλάσμα-
6 τι ἄρτου, καὶ μετὰ τοῦτο πορεύσεσθε. Καὶ ἐκάθισαν, καὶ ἔφα-
    γον ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ ἀμφότεροι, καὶ ἔπιον· καὶ εἶπεν ὁ πατὴρ τῆς
    νεάνιδος πρὸς τὸν ἄνδρα· ἀρξάμενος αὐλίσθητι, καὶ ἀγαθυνθήτω
7 ἡ καρδία σου. Καὶ ἀνέστη ὁ ἀνὴρ ἀπελθεῖν· καὶ ἐβιάσατο αὐτὸν
8 ὁ γαμβρὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάλιν ηὐλίσθη ἐκεῖ. Καὶ ὤρθρισε τοπρωΐ
    τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ πέμπτῃ τοῦ ἀπελθεῖν, καὶ εἶπεν ὁ πατὴρ τῆς νεά-
    νιδος· στήρισον δὴ τὴν καρδίαν σου ἄρτῳ, καὶ στρατεύθητι ἕως
9 κλίνῃ ἡ ἡμέρα· καὶ ἔφαγον, καὶ ἔπιον ἀμφότεροι. Καὶ ἀνέστη ὁ
    ἀνὴρ τοῦ ἀπελθεῖν, αὐτὸς καὶ ἡ παλλακὴ αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὸ παι-
    δάριον αὐτοῦ· καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ γαμβρὸς αὐτοῦ, ὁ πατὴρ τῆς νε-
    άνιδος· Ἰδοὺ δὴ εἰς ἑσπέραν κέκλικεν ἡ ἡμέρα, κατάλυσον δὴ

### Judges Chapter 18

**30.** And the sons of Dan did set up for themselves Micah's graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons, were priests unto the tribe of Dan, until the day of the captivity of the land.
**31.** And they set up for themselves Micah's graven image, which he had made, all the days that the house of God was in Shiloh.

### Judges Chapter 19

**1.** And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning in the side of Mount Ephraim; and he took to himself a concubine out of Bethlehem-Judah.
**2.** And his concubine was wroth with him, and departed from him unto her father's house in Bethlehem-Judah.
**3.** And she was there for the space of four months. And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak kindly unto her, to reconcile her unto himself, (and to bring her back again unto him); and his servant was with him, and a pair of asses: and he came unto the house of her father, and when the father of the young woman saw him, he came forth to meet him.
**4.** And his father-in-law, the father of the young woman, brought him into his house; and he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there.
**5.** And it came to pass on the fourth day, that they rose early in the morning, and he arose to depart: and the father of the young woman said unto his son-in-law, "Comfort your heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward go your way."
**6.** And they sat down, and did eat and drink together: and the father of the young woman said unto the man, "Be content, I pray you, and tarry all night, and let your heart be merry."
**7.** And when the man rose up to depart, his father-in-law constrained him: and he lodged there again.
**8.** And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart: and the father of the young woman said, "Comfort your heart, I pray you, with bread, and go forth on your journey until the day begins to decline." And they did eat and drink, both of them.
**9.** And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father-in-law, the father of the young woman, said unto him, "Behold now, the day declines toward evening; lodge here, I pray you,"
