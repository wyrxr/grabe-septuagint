ΚΕΦ. Ε΄. ς΄. ΚΡΙΤΑΙ 435
σκήνωσε· καὶ Δὰν ἵνατὶ παροικεῖ πλοίοις; Ἀσὴρ παρώκησε παρ
αἰγιαλὸν θαλασσῶν καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς διακοπὰς αὐτοῦ κατεσκήνωσε. 17
Ζαβουλὼν λαὸς ὀνειδείσας ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ εἰς θάνατον καὶ Νεφθαλείμ
ἐπὶ ὕψη ἀγροῦ. 19
Ἦλθον βασιλεῖς, καὶ παρετάξαντο, τότε ἐπολέμησαν
βασιλεῖς Χαναὰν ἐν Θεννὰχ ἐπὶ ὕδατος Μεγεδδὼ πλεονεξίαν ἀρ-
γυρίου οὐκ ἔλαβον. 20
Ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ἐπολέμησαν ἀστέρες, ἐκ τῆς
τάξεως αὐτῶν ἐπολέμησαν μετὰ Σισάρα. 21
Χειμάῤῥους Κεισὼν ἐξέβαλεν αὐτοὺς, χειμάῤῥους Καδημεὶμ, χειμάῤῥους Κεισὼν· κατα-
πατήσει αὐτὸν ψυχή μου δυνατή. 22
Τότε ἀπεκόπησαν πτέρναι ἵππου,
Μαδαραὼδ δυνατῶν αὐτοῦ. 23
Καταρᾶσθε Μαζὼρ, εἶπεν ὁ ἄγγελος
Κυρίου, καταράσει καταράσασθε τοὺς ἐνοίκους αὐτῆς, ὅτι οὐκ ἤλ-
θεσαν εἰς τὴν βοήθειαν Κυρίου· βοηθὸς ἡμῶν Κύριος ἐν μαχηταῖς
δυνατοῖς. 24
Εὐλογηθείη ἐκ γυναικῶν Ἰαὴλ γυνὴ Χαβὲρ τοῦ Κειναίου,
ἐκ γυναικῶν ἐν σκηνῇ εὐλογηθείη. 25
Ὕδωρ ᾔτησεν αὐτὴ, καὶ γάλα
ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ· ἐν λεκάνῃ ἰσχυρῶν προσήγγισε βούτυρον. 26
Τὴν χεῖρα
αὐτῆς τὴν ἀριστερὰν εἰς πάσσαλον ἐξέτεινε, τὴν δεξιὰν αὐτῆς εἰς
ἀποτομὰς κατακοπῶν, καὶ ἀπέτεμε Σισάρα· ἀπέτριψε τὴν κεφαλὴν
αὐτοῦ, καὶ συνέθλασε καὶ δίπλασε τὴν γνάθον αὐτοῦ. 27
Ἀναμέσον
τῶν ποδῶν αὐτῆς συγκαύψας ἔπεσεν, ἐκοιμήθη μεταξὺ ποδῶν
αὐτῆς· ἐν ᾧ ἐκάμφεν, ἐκεῖ ἔπεσε ταλαίπωρος. 28
Διὰ τῆς θυρίδος
διέκυπτε, καὶ κατεμάνθανεν ἡ μήτηρ Σισάρα διὰ τῆς δικτυωτῆς,
ἐπιβλέπουσα ἐπὶ τοὺς μεταστρέφοντας Σισάρα. Διατί ἠργάτισε τὸ
ἅρμα αὐτοῦ παραγενέσθαι; Διατί ἐχρόνισαν ἴχνη ἁρμάτων αὐτοῦ; 29
Σοφὴ ἀρχουσῶν αὐτῆς ἀνταπεκρίναντο πρὸς αὐτὴν καὶ αὐτὴ δὲ
ἀπεκρίνατο ἐν ῥήμασιν αὐτοῖς. 30
Οὐχὶ εὑρήσουσιν αὐτὸν διαμερίζοντα
σκῦλα; φιλιάζων φίλοις εἰς κεφαλὴν δυνατοῦ· σκῦλα βαμμάτων τῷ
Σισάρα, σκῦλα βαμμάτων ποικιλίας, βαφὴ ποικίλων, περὶ τράχηλον
αὐτοῦ σκύλων. 31
Οὕτως ἀπόλοιντο πάντες οἱ ἐχθροί σου, Κύριε· καὶ
οἱ ἀγαπῶντες αὐτὸν καθὼς ἡ ἀνατολὴ τοῦ ἡλίου ἐν δυναστείαις
αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἡσύχασεν ἡ γῆ τεσσαράκοντα ἔτη.

ΚΕΦ. ς΄. VI.

ΚΑΙ ἐποίησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ τὸ πονηρὸν ἔναντι Κυρίου, καὶ
παρέδωκεν αὐτοὺς Κύριος ἐν χειρὶ Μαδιὰμ ἔτη ἑπτά. 2
Καὶ κατίσχυσε χεὶρ Μαδιὰμ ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ· καὶ ἐποίησαν ἑαυτοῖς οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ

**JUDGES**
**CHAPTER 5.**

**17.** Gilead dwelt beyond the Jordan; and Dan, wherefore doth he tarry in ships? Asher abode by the seashore, and upon his divisions did he encamp.
**18.** Zebulun [was] a people that reproached its own soul unto death, and Naphtali upon the heights of the field.
**19.** The kings came, and they arrayed themselves for battle; then did the kings of Canaan fight in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of silver.
**20.** From the heaven did the stars fight; from their stations they fought with Sisera.
**21.** The torrent Kishon swept them away, the torrent Kadumim, the torrent Kishon! My mighty soul shall trample him down.
**22.** Then were the hooves of the horses cut off, the Madaraod of his mighty ones.
**23.** Curse ye Meroz, said the Angel of the Lord; curse ye, curse ye the inhabitants thereof, because they came not to the help of the Lord, [even] the Lord our helper among mighty warriors.
**24.** Blessed above women be Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite; blessed shall she be above women in the tent.
**25.** He asked for water, and she gave him milk; in a bowl of princely ones she offered butter.
**26.** Her left hand she stretched forth unto the tent-peg, and her right hand unto the sections of blows; and she smote Sisera. She struck his head, and she crushed and doubled his jaw.
**27.** Between her feet he bowed down [and] fell; he lay down between her feet. Where he bowed, there he fell, a wretched one.
**28.** Through the window she peered, and Sisera’s mother watched carefully through the latticework, looking out for those who would turn back Sisera. Wherefore hath his chariot tarried to come? Wherefore have the tracks of his chariots lingered?
**29.** The wise of her princesses answered her in return, and she herself answered them in words:
**30.** "Shall they not find him dividing the spoil? Befriending friends for the head of the mighty one? Spoil of dyed garments for Sisera, spoil of dyed garments of varied colors, a dye of varied colors, [a spoil] for his neck."
**31.** So perish all Thine enemies, O Lord! But let them that love Him be as the rising of the sun in its might. And the land had rest forty years.

**CHAPTER 6.**

**1.** And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord; and the Lord delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.
**2.** And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel; and the children of Israel made for themselves
