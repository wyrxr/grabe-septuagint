15 τοὺς καὶ ἐπάνω, δώσουσιν εἰσφορὰν Κυρίῳ· ὁ πλουτῶν οὐ προσθήσει, καὶ ὁ πενόμενος οὐκ ἐλαττονώσει ἀπὸ τοῦ ἡμίσεως τοῦ διδράχμου ἐν τῷ διδόναι τὴν εἰσφορὰν Κυρίῳ, ἐξιλάσασθαι περὶ 16 τῶν ψυχῶν ὑμῶν. Καὶ λήψῃ τὸ ἀργύριον τῆς εἰσφορᾶς παρὰ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ δώσεις αὐτὸ εἰς τὸ κάτεργον τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου· καὶ ἔσται τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραὴλ μνημόσυνον ἔναντι Κυ- 17 ρίου ἐξιλάσασθαι περὶ τῶν ψυχῶν ὑμῶν. Καὶ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς 18 Μωυσῆν, λέγων· ποίησον λουτῆρα χαλκοῦν, καὶ βάσιν αὐτῷ χαλκῆν, ὥστε νίπτεσθαι· καὶ θήσεις αὐτὸν ἀνὰ μέσον τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου, καὶ ἐκχεεῖς εἰς αὐτὸν 19 ὕδωρ. Καὶ νίψεται Ἀαρὼν καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν 20 ἐξ αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοὺς πόδας αὐτῶν ὕδατι· ὅταν εἰσπορεύωνται εἰς τὴν σκηνὴν τοῦ μαρτυρίου, νίψονται ὕδατι, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἀποθάνωσιν· ἢ ὅταν προσπορεύωνται πρὸς τὸ θυσιαστήριον λειτουργεῖν καὶ 21 ἀναφέρειν τὰ ὁλοκαυτώματα τῷ Κυρίῳ, νίψονται τὰς χεῖρας καὶ τοὺς πόδας αὐτῶν ὕδατι, (ὅταν εἰσπορεύωνται εἰς τὴν σκηνὴν τοῦ μαρτυρίου, νίψονται ὕδατι) καὶ οὐ μὴ ἀποθάνωσι· καὶ ἔσται αὐτοῖς 22 νόμιμον αἰώνιον, αὐτῷ καὶ ταῖς γενεαῖς αὐτῶν μετ᾿ αὐτούς. Καὶ 23 ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, λέγων· καὶ σὺ λάβε ἡδύσματα, ἄνθος σμύρνης ἐκλεκτῆς πεντακοσίους σίκλους, καὶ κινναμώμου εὐώδους τὸ ἥμισυ τούτου, διακοσίους καὶ πεντήκοντα, καὶ καλάμου 24 εὐώδους διακοσίους καὶ πεντήκοντα, καὶ ἴρεως πεντακοσίους σίκλους τοῦ ἁγίου, καὶ ἔλαιον ἐξ ἐλαίων Εἶν· 25 καὶ ποιήσεις αὐτὸ ἔλαιον χρίσμα ἅγιον, μύρον μυρεψικὸν τέχνῃ μυρεψοῦ· ἔλαιον χρίσμα ἅγιον ἔσται. 26 Καὶ χρίσεις ἐξ αὐτοῦ τὴν σκηνὴν τοῦ μαρτυρίου, 27 καὶ τὴν κιβωτὸν τοῦ μαρτυρίου, καὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη αὐτῆς, καὶ τὴν λυχνίαν καὶ (πάντα) τὰ σκεύη αὐτῆς, καὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον τοῦ 28 θυμιάματος, καὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον τῶν ὁλοκαυτωμάτων καὶ πάντα αὐτοῦ τὰ σκεύη, καὶ τὴν τράπεζαν καὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη αὐτῆς, 29 καὶ τὸν λουτῆρα καὶ τὴν βάσιν αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἁγιάσεις αὐτά, καὶ ἔσται ἅγια τῶν ἁγίων· πᾶς δ᾿ ἁπτόμενος αὐτῶν, ἁγιασθήσεται. 30 Καὶ Ἀαρὼν καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ χρίσεις, καὶ ἁγιάσεις αὐτούς, 31 ἱερατεύειν μοι. Καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραὴλ λαλήσεις, λέγων· ἔλαιον ἄλειμμα χρίσεως ἅγιον ἔσται τοῦτό μοι εἰς τὰς γενεὰς ὑμῶν. 32 Ἐπὶ σάρκα ἀνθρώπου οὐ χρισθήσεται, καὶ κατὰ τὴν σύνθεσιν ταύτην οὐ ποιήσετε ὑμῖν ἑαυτοῖς ὡσαύτως· ἅγιον ἔστι, καὶ ἁγίασμα

**EXODUS. CHAPTER 30.**

15 those [of them] who are above, shall give an offering unto the Lord. The rich shall not add thereto, nor the poor diminish [aught] from the half-shekel, when ye give the offering unto the Lord, to make propitiation for your souls.
16 And thou shalt take the silver of the offering from the sons of Israel, and shalt give it for the service of the tabernacle of witness; and it shall be unto the sons of Israel a memorial before the Lord, to make propitiation for your souls.

17 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying:
18 "Thou shalt make a laver of bronze, and its base of bronze, wherewith to wash; and thou shalt set it between the tabernacle of witness and between the altar, and thou shalt pour water therein.
19 And Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands therefrom,
20 and their feet with water: when they enter into the tabernacle of witness, they shall wash with water, and they shall in no wise die; or when they draw near unto the altar to minister, and to offer up the whole burnt offerings unto the Lord, they shall wash their hands and
21 their feet with water (when they enter into the tabernacle of witness, they shall wash with water), and they shall in no wise die; and it shall be an everlasting statute unto them, for him and for his generations after him."

22 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying:
23 "And thou, take unto thee sweet spices: of finest flower of myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon the half thereof, even two hundred and fifty [shekels], and of sweet calamus
24 two hundred and fifty [shekels], and of cassia five hundred shekels, [according to] the shekel of the sanctuary, and of olive oil a hin.
25 And thou shalt make it an oil for holy anointing, a perfume, the work of the perfumer's art; it shall be a holy anointing oil.
26 And thou shalt anoint therewith the tabernacle of witness,
27 and the ark of the testimony, and all its vessels, and the lampstand and (all) its vessels, and the altar of
28 incense, and the altar of the whole burnt offerings and all its vessels, and the table and all its vessels,
29 and the laver and its base. And thou shalt sanctify them, and they shall be most holy; and whosoever toucheth them shall be hallowed.
30 And Aaron and his sons shalt thou anoint, and thou shalt sanctify them, to minister unto me in the priest's office.
31 And unto the sons of Israel shalt thou speak, saying, 'This shall be unto me a holy anointing ointment throughout your generations.
32 Upon the flesh of man shall it not be poured, nor after this composition shall ye make any [like it] for yourselves. It is holy, and a sanctification [it shall be unto you].'"
