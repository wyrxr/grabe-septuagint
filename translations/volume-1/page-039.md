ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ ΙϚ΄. ΙΖ.

μου εἰς τὸν κόλπον σου· ἰδοῦσα δὲ ὅτι ἐν γαστρὶ ἔχει, ἠτιμάσθην
6 ἐναντίον αὐτῆς· κρῖναι ὁ Θεὸς ἀνὰ μέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ σοῦ. Εἶπε δὲ
Ἄβραμ πρὸς Σάραν· ἰδοὺ ἡ παιδίσκη σου ἐναντίον σου· χρῶ αὐτῇ,
ὡς δ᾽ ἂν σοι ἀρεστὸν ᾖ. Καὶ ἐκάκωσεν αὐτὴν Σάρα, καὶ ἀπέδρα
7 ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτῆς. Εὗρε δὲ αὐτὴν ἄγγελος Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ
ἐπὶ τῆς πηγῆς τοῦ ὕδατος ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, ἐπὶ τῆς πηγῆς ἐν τῇ
8 ὁδῷ Σούρ. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ ὁ ἄγγελος Κυρίου· Ἄγαρ παιδίσκη Σάρας,
πόθεν ἔρχῃ, καὶ ποῦ πορεύῃ; Καὶ εἶπεν· ἀπὸ προσώπου
9 Σάρας τῆς κυρίας μου ἐγὼ ἀποδιδράσκω. Εἶπε δὲ αὐτῇ ὁ ἄγγελος
Κυρίου· ἀποστράφηθι πρὸς τὴν κυρίαν σου, καὶ ταπεινώθητι ὑπὸ
10 τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῆς. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ ὁ ἄγγελος Κυρίου· πληθύνων
πληθυνῶ τὸ σπέρμα σου, καὶ οὐκ ἀριθμήσεται ἀπὸ τοῦ πλήθους.
11 Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ ὁ ἄγγελος Κυρίου· ἰδοὺ σὺ ἐν γαστρὶ ἔχεις, καὶ
τέξῃ υἱόν, καὶ καλέσεις τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ἰσμαήλ· ὅτι ἐπήκουσεν
12 Κύριος τῇ ταπεινώσει σου. Οὗτος ἔσται ἀγροῖκος ἄνθρωπος· αἱ χεῖρες
αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ πάντας, καὶ αἱ χεῖρες πάντων ἐπ᾽ αὐτόν· καὶ κατὰ
13 πρόσωπον πάντων τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτοῦ κατοικήσει. Καὶ ἐκάλεσεν Ἄγαρ
τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου τοῦ λαλοῦντος πρὸς αὐτήν, σὺ ὁ Θεὸς ὁ ἐφιδών
με· ὅτι εἶπε· καὶ γὰρ ἐνώπιον ἴδον ὀρθέντα μοι. Ἕνεκεν τούτου
ἐκάλεσε τὸ φρέαρ, φρέαρ οὗ ἐνώπιον ἴδον· ἰδοὺ ἀνὰ μέσον Κάδης
15 καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον Βραάδ. Καὶ ἔτεκεν Ἄγαρ τῷ Ἄβραμ υἱόν, καὶ
ἐκάλεσεν Ἄβραμ τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ, ὃν ἔτεκεν αὐτῷ Ἄγαρ,
16 Ἰσμαήλ. Ἄβραμ δὲ ἦν ὀγδοηκονταὲξ ἐτῶν, ἡνίκα ἔτεκεν Ἄγαρ
τὸν Ἰσμαὴλ τῷ Ἄβραμ.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΖ΄. XVII.

1 ἘΓΕΝΕΤΟ δὲ Ἄβραμ ἐτῶν ἐνενηκονταεννέα· καὶ ὤφθη Κύριος
τῷ Ἄβραμ, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ Θεός σου, εὐαρέστει
2 ἐναντίον ἐμοῦ, καὶ γίνου ἄμεμπτος. Καὶ θήσομαι τὴν διαθήκην μου
ἀνὰ μέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον σου· καὶ πληθυνῶ σε σφόδρα.
3 Καὶ ἔπεσεν Ἄβραμ ἐπὶ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐλάλησεν αὐτῷ ὁ
4 Θεός, λέγων· καὶ ἐγὼ ἰδοὺ ἡ διαθήκη μου μετὰ σοῦ, καὶ ἔσῃ πατήρ
5 πλήθους ἐθνῶν· καὶ οὐ κληθήσεται ἔτι τὸ ὄνομά σου Ἄβραμ,
ἀλλ᾽ ἔσται Ἀβραὰμ τὸ ὄνομά σου· ὅτι πατέρα πολλῶν ἐθνῶν τέθεινά σε.
6 Καὶ αὐξανῶ σε σφόδρα σφόδρα, καὶ θήσω σε εἰς ἔθνη,

**Genesis 16**
⁵...[I have given] my [handmaiden] into thy bosom; but when she saw that she was with child, I was despised in her sight; let God be judge between me and thee.
⁶Then Abram said unto Sarai, "Behold, thy handmaiden is before thee; deal with her as it is pleasing unto thee." And Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her presence.

⁷And the Angel of the Lord God found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur. ⁸And the Angel of the Lord said unto her, "Hagar, Sarai's handmaiden, whence comest thou? and whither goest thou?" And she said, "I flee from the presence of Sarai my mistress."
⁹Then the Angel of the Lord said unto her, "Return to thy mistress, and be thou humbled beneath her hands."
¹⁰And the Angel of the Lord said unto her, "I will greatly multiply thy seed, and it shall not be numbered for multitude."
¹¹And the Angel of the Lord said unto her, "Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; for the Lord hath heard thy humiliation.
¹²He shall be a wild man; his hands shall be against all, and the hands of all against him; and he shall dwell opposite the face of all his brethren."
¹³And Hagar called the Name of the Lord Who spoke unto her, "Thou art the God Who hath looked upon me"; for she said, "For indeed I saw [one] standing before me." ¹⁴Therefore she called the well, "The Well of Him Whom I Saw Before"; behold, it is between Kadesh and between Bered.

¹⁵And Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore to him, Ishmael. ¹⁶And Abram was eighty and six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.

**Genesis 17**
¹And it came to pass, when Abram was ninety and nine years old, that the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said unto him, "I am thy God; be thou well-pleasing before Me, and be thou blameless.
²And I will set My covenant between Me and between thee; and I will multiply thee exceedingly."
³And Abram fell upon his face; and God spoke with him, saying,
⁴"As for Me, behold, My covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of a multitude of nations.
⁵And thy name shall no longer be called Abram, but Abraham shall be thy name; for a father of many nations have I made thee.
⁶And I will increase thee very, very greatly, and I will make of thee nations, and kings shall come out of thee."
