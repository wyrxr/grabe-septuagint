ΚΕΦ. Η'. Θ'.
30 μὴ ἐξαποστεῖλαι τὸν λαόν, θῦσαι Κυρίῳ. Ἐξῆλθε δὲ Μωυσῆς ἀπὸ
   Φαραώ, καὶ ηὔξατο πρὸς τὸν Θεόν. Ἐποίησε δὲ Κύριος καθά-
32 περ εἶπε Μωυσῆς· καὶ περιεῖλε τὴν κυνόμυιαν ἀπὸ Φαραώ, καὶ
   ἀπὸ τῶν θεραπόντων αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐκ
   ἐλείφθη οὐδεμία. Καὶ ἐβάρυνε Φαραὼ τὴν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπὶ
   τοῦ καιροῦ τούτου, καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησεν ἐξαποστεῖλαι τὸν λαόν.

ΚΕΦ. Θ'. ΙΧ.

1  Εἶπε δὲ Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν· εἴσελθε πρὸς Φαραώ, καὶ ἐρεῖς
   αὐτῷ· τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τῶν Ἑβραίων· ἐξαπόστειλον τὸν
2  λαόν μου, ἵνα λατρεύσωσί μοι. Εἰ μὲν οὖν μὴ βούλει ἐξαποστεῖ-
3  λαι τὸν λαόν μου, καὶ ἔτι ἐγκρατεῖς αὐτοῦ, ἰδοὺ χεὶρ Κυρίου ἔ-
   σται ἐν τοῖς κτήνεσί σου τοῖς ἐν τοῖς πεδίοις· ἔν τε τοῖς ἵπποις,
   καὶ ἐν τοῖς ὑποζυγίοις, καὶ ἐν τοῖς καμήλοις, καὶ βουσί, καὶ προ-
4  βάτοις θάνατος μέγα σφόδρα. Καὶ παραδοξάσω ἐγὼ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ
   ἐκείνῳ ἀνὰ μέσον τῶν κτηνῶν τῶν Αἰγυπτίων, καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον τῶν
   κτηνῶν τοῦ Ἰσραήλ· καὶ οὐ τελευτήσει ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν κτηνῶν τῶν
5  υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ ῥητόν. Καὶ ἔδωκεν ὁ Θεὸς ὅρον, λέγων· αὔριον ποιή-
6  σει Κύριος τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς (Αἰγύπτου). Καὶ ἐποίησε
   Κύριος τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο τῇ ἐπαύριον, καὶ ἐτελεύτησε πάντα τὰ κτή-
   νη τῶν Αἰγυπτίων· ἀπὸ δὲ τῶν κτηνῶν τῶν υἱῶν (τοῦ) Ἰσραὴλ
7  οὐκ ἐτελεύτησεν οὐδέν. Ἰδὼν δὲ Φαραώ, ὅτι οὐκ ἐτελεύτησεν ἀπὸ
   τῶν κτηνῶν τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ οὐδέν, ἐβαρύνθη ἡ καρδία Φαραώ,
8  καὶ οὐκ ἐξαπέστειλε τὸν λαόν. Εἶπε δὲ Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν καὶ
   Ἀαρών, λέγων· λάβετε ὑμῖν πλήρεις τὰς χεῖρας αἰθάλης καμι-
   ναίας, καὶ πασάτω Μωυσῆς εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν ἐναντίον Φαραώ, καὶ
9  ἐναντίον τῶν θεραπόντων αὐτοῦ· καὶ γενηθήτω κονιορτὸς ἐπὶ πᾶ-
   σαν γῆν Αἰγύπτου, καὶ ἔσται ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀνθρώπους καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ τε-
   τράποδα ἕλκη, φλυκτίδες ἀναζέουσαι ἔν τε τοῖς ἀνθρώποις, καὶ ἐν
10 τοῖς τετράποσι, (καὶ) ἐν πάσῃ γῇ Αἰγύπτου. Καὶ ἔλαβον τὴν αἰ-
   θάλην τῆς καμιναίας ἐναντίον Φαραώ, καὶ ἔπασεν αὐτὴν Μωυσῆς
   εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν· καὶ ἐγένετο ἕλκη, φλυκτίδες ἀναζέουσαι ἔν τε τοῖς
11 ἀνθρώποις, καὶ ἐν τοῖς τετράποσι. Καὶ οὐκ ἠδύναντο οἱ φαρμα-
   κοὶ στῆναι ἐναντίον Μωυσῆ διὰ τὰ ἕλκη· ἐγένοντο γὰρ τὰ ἕλκη
12 ἐν τοῖς φαρμακοῖς, καὶ ἐν πάσῃ γῇ Αἰγύπτου. Ἐσκλήρυνε δὲ Κύ-

**EXODUS**

**Chapter 8**
30 ...[that he should] not send forth the people to sacrifice unto the Lord.
And Moses went forth from Pharaoh, and made his prayer unto God.
32 And the Lord did according as Moses had spoken; and He removed the dog-flies from Pharaoh, and from his servants, and from all his people, and not one [of them] was left.
Yet Pharaoh hardened his heart even at this time, and would not send forth the people.

**Chapter 9**
1   Then the Lord said unto Moses: "Go in unto Pharaoh, and you shall say unto him, 'Thus saith the Lord, the God of the Hebrews: Send forth My people, that they may worship Me.
2   If, therefore, you will not send forth My people, and do yet detain them,
3   behold, the hand of the Lord shall be upon your cattle which are in the fields; upon the horses, upon the asses, and upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep; a very grievous pestilence [shall be among them].
4   And I shall make a wondrous distinction in that time between the cattle of the Egyptians and between the cattle of Israel; and not a single thing of all the cattle of the sons of Israel shall die.'
5   And God set a definite time, saying, 'Tomorrow the Lord shall do this thing upon the land (of Egypt).'"
6   And the Lord did this thing on the morrow, and all the livestock of the Egyptians died; but of the cattle of the sons (of) Israel, not one died.
7   And when Pharaoh saw that not one of the livestock of the sons of Israel had died, the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he would not send forth the people.
8   Then the Lord said unto Moses and unto Aaron, "Take unto yourselves your hands full of furnace soot, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven before Pharaoh, and before his servants;
9   and let it become dust upon all the land of Egypt, and it shall be upon men and upon the four-footed beasts, [even] boils, festering blisters, both upon men and upon the four-footed beasts, (and) in all the land of Egypt."
10  And they took the furnace soot before Pharaoh, and Moses sprinkled it toward the heaven; and there came to be boils, festering blisters, both upon men
11  and upon the four-footed beasts. And the sorcerers could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boils were upon the sorcerers, and upon all the land of Egypt.
12  But the Lord hardened...
