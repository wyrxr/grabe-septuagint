3 λύψεις αὐτὰ χαλκῷ. Καὶ ποιήσεις στεφάνην τῷ θυσιαστηρίῳ, καὶ
    τὸν καλυπτῆρα αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰς φιάλας αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰς κρεάγρας
    αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὸ πυρεῖον αὐτοῦ· πάντα τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ ποιήσεις χαλ-
4 κᾶ. Καὶ ποιήσεις αὐτῷ ἐσχάραν ἔργῳ δικτυωτῷ χαλκῆν· καὶ ποιή-
    σεις τῇ ἐσχάρα τέσσαρας δακτυλίους χαλκοῦς ἐπὶ τὰ τέσσαρα
5 κλίτη. Καὶ ὑποθήσεις αὐτοὺς ὑπὸ τὴν ἐσχάραν τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου
6 κάτωθεν· ἔσται δὲ ἡ ἐσχάρα ἕως ἡμίσους τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου. Καὶ
    ποιήσεις φορεῖς τῷ θυσιαστηρίῳ ἐκ ξύλων ἀσήπτων, καὶ περιχαλ-
7 κώσεις αὐτοὺς χαλκῷ· καὶ εἰσάξεις τοὺς φορεῖς εἰς τοὺς δακτυ-
    λίους, καὶ ἔστωσαν οἱ φορεῖς κατὰ τὰ δύο πλευρὰ τοῦ θυσιαστη-
8 ρίου ἐν τῷ αἴρειν αὐτό· κοῖλον σανιδωτὸν ποιήσεις αὐτό· κατὰ τὸ
9 παραδειχθέν σοι ἐν τῷ ὄρει, οὕτω ποιήσεις. Καὶ ποιήσεις αὐλὴν
    τῇ σκηνῇ· εἰς τὸ κλίτος τὸ πρὸς λίβα ἱστία τῆς αὐλῆς ἐκ βύσ-
10 σου κεκλωσμένης, μῆκος ἑκατὸν πήχεων τῷ ἑνὶ κλίτει· καὶ στύ-
    λοι αὐτῶν εἴκοσι, καὶ βάσεις αὐτῶν εἴκοσι χαλκαῖ, καὶ οἱ κρίκοι
11 αὐτῶν καὶ αἱ ψαλίδες αὐτῶν ἀργυραῖ. Οὕτω τῷ κλίτει τῷ πρὸς
    βορρᾶν ἱστία ἑκατὸν πήχεων μῆκος· καὶ οἱ στύλοι αὐτῶν εἴκοσι,
    καὶ αἱ βάσεις αὐτῶν εἴκοσι χαλκαῖ, καὶ οἱ κρίκοι αὐτῶν καὶ αἱ
    ψαλίδες τῶν στύλων, καὶ αἱ βάσεις περιηργυρωμέναι ἀργυρίῳ.
12 Τὸ δὲ εὖρος τῆς αὐλῆς τὸ κατὰ θάλασσαν ἱστία πεντήκοντα πήχεων·
13 στύλοι αὐτῶν δέκα, καὶ βάσεις αὐτῶν δέκα. Καὶ εὖρος τῆς αὐ-
    λῆς τὸ πρὸς ἀνατολὰς ἱστία πεντήκοντα πήχεων· στύλοι αὐτῶν
14 δέκα, καὶ βάσεις αὐτῶν δέκα. Καὶ πεντεκαίδεκα πήχεων τῶν ἱστίων
    τὸ ὕψος τῷ κλίτει τῷ ἑνί· στύλοι αὐτῶν τρεῖς, καὶ βάσεις αὐ-
15 τῶν τρεῖς. Καὶ τὸ κλίτος τὸ δεύτερον πεντεκαίδεκα πήχεων τῶν
    ἱστίων τὸ ὕψος, στύλοι αὐτῶν τρεῖς, καὶ βάσεις αὐτῶν τρεῖς.
16 Καὶ τῇ πύλῃ τῆς αὐλῆς κάλυμμα, εἴκοσι πήχεων τὸ ὕψος, ἐξ ὑα-
    κίνθου, καὶ πορφύρας, καὶ κοκκίνου κεκλωσμένου, καὶ βύσσου κε-
    κλωσμένης τῇ ποικιλίᾳ τοῦ ῥαφιδευτοῦ· στύλοι αὐτῶν τέσσαρες,
17 καὶ βάσεις αὐτῶν τέσσαρες. Πάντες οἱ στύλοι τῆς αὐλῆς κύκλῳ
    κατηργυρωμένοι ἀργυρίῳ· καὶ αἱ κεφαλίδες αὐτῶν ἀργυραῖ, καὶ
18 αἱ βάσεις αὐτῶν χαλκαῖ. Τὸ δὲ μῆκος τῆς αὐλῆς ἑκατὸν ἐφ᾽ ἑ-
    κατόν, καὶ εὖρος πεντήκοντα ἐπὶ πεντήκοντα, καὶ ὕψος πέντε πή-
19 χεων, ἐκ βύσσου κεκλωσμένης, καὶ αἱ βάσεις αὐτῶν χαλκαῖ. Καὶ
    πᾶσα ἡ ἀποσκευὴ τῆς σκηνῆς, καὶ πάντα τὰ ἐργαλεῖα, καὶ οἱ
20 πάσσαλοι τῆς αὐλῆς χαλκοῖ. Καὶ σὺ σύνταξον τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ,

3   Thou shalt overlay them with brass. And thou shalt make a border for the altar,
    and its pans, and its bowls, and its fleshhooks,
    and its firepans: all its utensils shalt thou make of brass.
4   Moreover, thou shalt make for it a grating of network, of brass;
    and upon the grating shalt thou make four rings of brass upon its four corners.
5   And thou shalt place them beneath the grating of the altar below;
    and the grating shall be [set] up to half of the altar.
6   And thou shalt make poles for the altar of imperishable wood,
    and shalt overlay them with brass.
7   And thou shalt put the poles into the rings,
    and the poles shall be on the two sides of the altar, when they bear it.
8   Thou shalt make it hollow with boards:
    according to that which was shown unto thee in the mount, so shalt thou make it.
9   And thou shalt make a court for the tabernacle:
    for the south side, hangings of the court [made] of spun fine linen,
    an hundred cubits in length for the one side.
10  And their pillars twenty, and their bases twenty of brass;
    and their hooks and their fillets of silver.
11  Likewise for the north side, hangings an hundred cubits in length;
    and their pillars twenty, and their bases twenty of brass;
    and their hooks and the fillets of the pillars, and the bases overlaid with silver.
12  And the breadth of the court towards the west, hangings of fifty cubits.
13  Their pillars ten, and their bases ten.

14  Their pillars ten, and their bases ten.
    And for one side, the hangings [shall be] fifteen cubits in length;
    their pillars three, and their bases three.
15  And for the second side, the hangings [shall be] fifteen cubits in length;
    their pillars three, and their bases three.
16  And for the gate of the court a curtain, twenty cubits in length,
    of hyacinth, and purple, and scarlet spun, and fine linen spun,
    of the embroiderer's work; their pillars four, and their bases four.
17  All the pillars of the court round about shall be overlaid with silver;
    and their capitals of silver, and their bases of brass.
18  And the length of the court [shall be] an hundred by an hundred,
    and the breadth fifty by fifty, and the height five cubits,
19  of spun fine linen; and their bases of brass.
    And all the furniture of the tabernacle, and all the instruments,
    and the
20  pegs of the court [shall be] of brass.
    And thou, do thou command the sons of Israel,
