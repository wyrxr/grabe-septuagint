ΚΑΙ μετὰ ταῦτα ἐξῆρεν ὁ λαὸς ἐξ Ἀσηρώθ, καὶ παρενέβαλεν 1
ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ τοῦ Φαράν. Καὶ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, 2
λέγων· ἀπόστειλον σεαυτῷ ἄνδρας, καὶ κατασκεψάσθωσαν τὴν γῆν 3
τῶν Χαναναίων, ἣν ἐγὼ δίδωμι τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραὴλ εἰς κατάσχε-
σιν ἄνδρα ἕνα ἄνδρα ἕνα κατὰ φυλήν, κατὰ δήμους πατριῶν αὐ-
τῶν, ἀποστελεῖς αὐτοὺς, πάντα ἀρχηγὸν ἐξ αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἀπέστει- 4
λεν αὐτοὺς Μωυσῆς ἐκ τῆς ἐρήμου Φαρὰν διὰ φωνῆς Κυρίου·
πάντες ἄνδρες ἀρχηγοὶ υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ οὗτοι. Καὶ ταῦτα τὰ ὀνό- 5
ματα αὐτῶν· τῆς φυλῆς Ῥουβήν, Σαμαλιὴλ υἱὸς Ζαχούρ· τῆς 6
φυλῆς Συμεών, Σαφὰτ υἱὸς Σουρί· τῆς φυλῆς Ἰούδα, Χάλεβε υἱὸς 7
Ἰεφοννή· 8 τῆς φυλῆς Ἰσσάχαρ, Ἰγὰλ υἱὸς Ἰωσήφ· τῆς φυλῆς 9
Ἐφραίμ, Αὐσὴ υἱὸς Ναυῆ· τῆς φυλῆς Βενιαμείν, Φαλτὶ υἱὸς 10
Ῥαφού· 11 τῆς φυλῆς Ζαβουλών, Γουδιὴλ υἱὸς Σουδί· τῆς φυλῆς Ἰω- 12
σὴφ τῶν υἱῶν Μανασσῆ, Γαδδὶ υἱὸς Σουσί· τῆς φυλῆς Δὰν, Ἀ- 13
μιὴλ υἱὸς Γαμαλί· 14 τῆς φυλῆς Ἀσήρ, Σαβοὺρ υἱὸς Μιχαήλ· τῆς 15
φυλῆς Νεφθαλί, Ναβὰδ υἱὸς Ἰαβί· τῆς φυλῆς Γὰδ, Γουδιὴλ υἱὸς 16
Μαχχί. Ταῦτα τὰ ὀνόματα τῶν ἀνδρῶν, οὓς ἀπέστειλε Μωυσῆς 17
κατασκέψασθαι τὴν γῆν· καὶ ἐπωνόμασε Μωυσῆς τὸν Αὐσὴ υἱὸν
Ναυῆ, Ἰησοῦν. Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν αὐτοὺς Μωυσῆς κατασκέψασθαι 18
τὴν γῆν Χαναάν, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτούς· ἀνάβητε ταύτῃ τῇ ἐρή-
μῳ, καὶ ἀναβήσεσθε εἰς τὸ ὄρος, καὶ ὄψεσθε τὴν γῆν τίς ἐστι, 19
καὶ τὸν λαὸν τὸν ἐγκαθήμενον ἐπ᾽ αὐτῆς, εἰ ἰσχυρός ἐστιν, ἢ ἀ-
σθενής, ἢ ὀλίγοι εἰσὶν ἢ πολλοί· καὶ τίς ἡ γῆ εἰς ἣν οὗτοι ἐγ- 20
κάθηνται ἐπ᾽ αὐτήν, εἰ καλὴ ἐστιν ἢ πονηρά· καὶ τίνες αἱ πόλεις
ἃς οὗτοι κατοικοῦσιν ἐν αὐταῖς, εἰ ἐν τειχήρεσιν ἢ ἐν ἀτει-
χίστοις· καὶ τίς ἡ γῆ, ἢ πίων ἢ παρειμένη, εἰ ἔστιν ἐν αὐτῇ 21
δένδρα, ἢ οὔ· καὶ προσκαρτερήσαντες λήψεσθε ἀπὸ τῶν καρπῶν
τῆς γῆς· καὶ αἱ ἡμέραι, ἡμέραι ἔαρος, πρόδρομοι σταφυλῆς. Καὶ 22
ἀναβάντες κατεσκέψαντο τὴν γῆν, ἀπὸ τῆς ἐρήμου Σὶν ἕως Ῥοώβ,
εἰσπορευομένων Αἰμάθ. Καὶ ἀνέβησαν κατὰ τὴν ἔρημον, καὶ ἦλ- 23
θον εἰς Χεβρών· καὶ ἐκεῖ Ἀχιμὰν, καὶ Σεσοί, καὶ Θαλαμείν, γε-
νεαὶ Ἑνάκ· καὶ Χεβρὼν ἑπτὰ ἔτεσιν ᾠκοδομήθη πρὸ τοῦ Τάνιν
Αἰγύπτου. Καὶ ἦλθοσαν ἕως φάραγγος βότρυος, καὶ κατεσκέψαντο 24

CHAPTER 13

1 And after these things, the people removed from Aseroth, and encamped
    in the wilderness of Pharan.
2 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying:
3 “Send forth for thyself men, that they may spy out the land
    of the Canaanites, which I give unto the sons of Israel for an
    inheritance: one man, one man for each tribe, according to the
    thousands of their fathers, shalt thou send them, every chief
    from among them.”
4 And Moses sent them forth from the wilderness of Pharan,
    by the voice of the Lord: and these were all the men,
    the chiefs of the sons of Israel.
5 And these are their names:
    Of the tribe of Reuben, Samaliel the son of Zachur;
6   Of the tribe of Simeon, Saphat the son of Souri;
7   Of the tribe of Judah, Chalebe the son of Iephonni;
8   Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Ioseph;
9   Of the tribe of Ephraim, Ause the son of Naue;
10  Of the tribe of Benjamin, Phalti the son of Raphhou;
11  Of the tribe of Zabulon, Goudiel the son of Soudi;
12  Of the tribe of Ioseph, of the sons of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Sousi;
13  Of the tribe of Dan, Amiel the son of Gamali;
14  Of the tribe of Aser, Sabour the son of Michael;
15  Of the tribe of Nephthali, Nabad the son of Iabi;
16  Of the tribe of Gad, Goudiel the son of Macchi.
17 These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out
    the land: and Moses renamed Ause, the son of Naue, Iesoun.
18 And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them:
    “Go ye up by this wilderness, and ye shall ascend unto the mountain,
    and ye shall see what manner of land it is,
19  and the people that dwell upon it, whether they be strong, or weak;
    or few in number, or many;
20  and what manner of land it is, into which they dwell upon it,
    whether it be good or evil; and what manner of cities
    they dwell within them, whether they be in walled places or in unwalled;
21  and what manner of land it is, whether fat or lean,
    whether there be trees therein, or no. And persevering,
    ye shall take of the fruits of the land;
    for these days are the days of spring, the forerunners of the grape.”
22 And they went up and spied out the land,
    from the wilderness of Sin even unto Rhoob, as one enters into Aemath.
23 And they went up by the wilderness, and came unto Chebron;
    and there were Achiman, and Sesoi, and Thalamein, the generations
    of Enak; and Chebron was built seven years before Tanin of Egypt.
24 And they came unto the valley of the cluster, and they spied out
