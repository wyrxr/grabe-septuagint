1   Ἀπῆραν δὲ ἐξ Αἰλεὶμ, καὶ ἦλθον πᾶσα συναγωγὴ υἱῶν
    Ἰσραὴλ εἰς τὴν ἔρημον Σὶν, ὃ ἐστιν ἀνὰ μέσον Αἰλεὶμ, καὶ ἀνὰ
    μέσον Σινά. Τῇ δὲ πεντεκαιδεκάτῃ ἡμέρᾳ, τῷ μηνὶ τῷ δευτέρῳ
2   ἐξεληλυθότων αὐτῶν ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, διεγόγγυζε πᾶσα συναγωγὴ
3   υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ ἐπὶ Μωσῆν καὶ Ἀαρὼν· καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς αὐτοὺς
    οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ· Ὄφελον ἀπεθάνομεν πληγέντες ὑπὸ Κυρίου ἐν γῇ
    Αἰγύπτῳ, ὅταν ἐκαθίσαμεν ἐπὶ τῶν λεβήτων τῶν κρεῶν, καὶ ἠσθίομεν
    ἄρτους εἰς πλησμονήν· ἔτι ἐξηγάγετε ἡμᾶς εἰς τὴν ἔρημον
    ταύτην, ἀποκτεῖναι πᾶσαν τὴν συναγωγὴν ταύτην ἐν λιμῷ.
4   Εἶπε δὲ Κύριος πρὸς Μωσῆν· Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ὕω ὑμῖν ἄρτους ἐκ τοῦ
    οὐρανοῦ· καὶ ἐξελεύσεται ὁ λαὸς, καὶ συλλέξουσι τὸ τῆς ἡμέρας
    εἰς ἡμέραν, ὅπως πειράσω αὐτοὺς, εἰ πορεύσονται ἐν τῷ νόμῳ μου
5   ἢ οὔ. Καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἕκτῃ, καὶ ἑτοιμάσουσιν ὃ ἂν
    εἰσενέγκωσι· καὶ ἔσται διπλοῦν ὃ ἂν εἰσενέγκωσι τὸ καθ᾿ ἡμέραν
6   εἰς ἡμέραν. Εἶπε Μωσῆς καὶ Ἀαρὼν πρὸς πᾶσαν συναγωγὴν
    υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ· ἑσπέρας γνώσεσθε ὅτι Κύριος ἐξήγαγεν ὑμᾶς ἐκ
7   γῆς Αἰγύπτου· καὶ πρωΐ ὄψεσθε τὴν δόξαν Κυρίου, ἐν τῷ εἰσακοῦσαι
    αὐτὸν τὸν γογγυσμὸν ὑμῶν ἐπὶ τῷ Θεῷ· ἡμεῖς δὲ τί ἐσμεν,
8   ὅτι γογγύζετε καθ᾿ ἡμῶν; Καὶ εἶπε Μωσῆς· ἐν τῷ διδόναι Κύριον
    ὑμῖν ἑσπέρας κρέα φαγεῖν, καὶ ἄρτους τὸ πρωΐ εἰς πλησμονὴν,
    διὰ τὸ εἰσακοῦσαι Κύριον τὸν γογγυσμὸν ὑμῶν, ὃν ὑμεῖς
    διαγογγύζετε καθ᾿ ἡμῶν· ἡμεῖς δὲ τί ἐσμεν; οὐ γὰρ καθ᾿ ἡμῶν
9   ὁ γογγυσμὸς ὑμῶν ἐστιν, ἀλλ᾿ ἢ κατὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ. Εἶπε δὲ Μωυσῆς
    πρὸς Ἀαρὼν· εἶπον πάσῃ συναγωγῇ υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ· προσέλθατε
    ἐναντίον τοῦ Θεοῦ, εἰσακήκοε γὰρ ὑμῶν τὸν γογγυσμόν.
10  Ἡνίκα δὲ ἐλάλει Ἀαρὼν πάσῃ συναγωγῇ υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ ἐπεστράφησαν
    εἰς τὴν ἔρημον, καὶ ἡ δόξα Κυρίου ὤφθη ἐν νεφέλῃ.
11  Καὶ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωσῆν, λέγων·
12  εἰσακήκοα τὸν γογγυσμὸν τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ· λάλησον πρὸς
    αὐτοὺς, λέγων· τὸ πρὸς ἑσπέραν ἔδεσθε κρέα, καὶ τὸ πρωΐ πλησθήσεσθε
    ἄρτων, καὶ γνώσεσθε ὅτι ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν.
13  Καὶ ἐγένετο ἑσπέρα, καὶ ἀνέβη ὀρτυγομήτρα, καὶ ἐκάλυψε τὴν
    παρεμβολήν· τὸ πρωΐ δὲ ἐγένετο, καταπαυομένης τῆς δρόσου κύκλῳ τῆς
14  παρεμβολῆς· καὶ

**Exodus, Chapter 16**

<sup>1</sup>And they departed from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and between Sinai; on the fifteenth day, in the second month 
<sup>2</sup>after they were departed from the land of Egypt, all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron. 
<sup>3</sup>And the children of Israel said unto them, "Would that we had died, struck down by the Lord in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the pots of flesh and did eat bread to the full! Yet ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to slay all this congregation with hunger."

<sup>4</sup>Then the Lord said unto Moses, "Behold, I shall rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go forth, and they shall gather that which is sufficient for the day, each day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in My law or not. 
<sup>5</sup>And it shall be on the sixth day, that they shall prepare that which they shall bring in; and it shall be double what they shall bring in each day."

<sup>6</sup>And Moses and Aaron said unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, "In the evening ye shall know that the Lord hath brought you forth from the land of Egypt; 
<sup>7</sup>and in the morning ye shall see the glory of the Lord, when He heareth your murmuring against God; for what are we, 
<sup>8</sup>that ye murmur against us?"

And Moses said, "When the Lord doth give you flesh to eat in the evening, and bread in the morning to the full, because the Lord hath heard your murmuring, that which ye murmur against us—for what are we? For your murmuring is not against us, but against God."

<sup>9</sup>And Moses said unto Aaron, "Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, 'Come ye near before God, for He hath heard your murmuring.'" 
<sup>10</sup>And it came to pass, when Aaron spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, as they turned toward the wilderness, that the glory of the Lord appeared in a cloud.

<sup>11</sup>And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 
<sup>12</sup>"I have heard the murmuring of the children of Israel. Speak thou unto them, saying, 'At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God.'"

<sup>13</sup>And it came to pass at even, that quails came up and covered the camp; and in the morning, when the dew had settled round about the camp,
