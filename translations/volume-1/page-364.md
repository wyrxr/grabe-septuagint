ΚΕΦ. ΚΒʹ. ΔΕΥΤΕΡΟΝΟΜΙΟΝ 349
τὰ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου, καὶ ἀποδώσεις αὐτὰ αὐτῷ.
**3** Οὕτως ποιήσεις τὸν ὄνον αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὕτως ποιήσεις τὸ ἱμάτιον αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὕτως ποιήσεις κατὰ πᾶσαν ἀπώλειαν τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου, ὅσα ἐὰν ἀπόληται παρ᾽ αὐτοῦ, καὶ εὕρῃς αὐτά οὐ δυνήσῃ ὑπεριδεῖν αὐτά.
**4** Οὐχ ὄψῃ τὸν ὄνον τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου ἢ τὸν μόσχον αὐτοῦ πεπτωκότας ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ, μὴ ὑπερίδῃς αὐτά· ἀνιστῶν ἀναστήσεις αὐτὰ μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ.
**5** Οὐχ ἔσται σκεύη ἀνδρὸς ἐπὶ γυναικί, οὐδὲ μὴ ἐνδύσηται ἀνὴρ στολὴν γυναικείαν· ὅτι βδέλυγμα Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ σου ἐστι πᾶς ποιῶν ταῦτα.
**6** Ἐὰν δὲ συναντήσῃς νοσσιὰ ὀρνέων πρὸ προσώπου σου ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ ἢ ἐπὶ παντὶ δένδρει, ἢ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς νοσσοῖς ἢ ὠοῖς, καὶ ἡ μήτηρ θάλπῃ ἐπὶ τῶν νοσσῶν ἢ ἐπὶ τῶν ὠῶν, οὐ λήψῃ τὴν μητέρα μετὰ τῶν τέκνων·
**7** ἀποστολῇ ἀποστελεῖς τὴν μητέρα, τὰ δὲ παιδία λήψῃ σεαυτῷ, ἵνα εὖ σοι γένηται, καὶ πολυήμερος ἔσῃ.
**8** Ἐὰν δὲ οἰκοδομήσῃς οἰκίαν καινήν, ποιήσεις στεφάνην τῷ δώματί σου, καὶ οὐ ποιήσεις φόνον ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ σου, ἐὰν πέσῃ δ᾽ πεσὼν ἀπ᾽ αὐτῆς.
**9** Οὐ κατασπερεῖς τὸν ἀμπελῶνά σου διάφορον, ἵνα μὴ ἁγιασθῇ τὸ γέννημα, καὶ τὸ σπέρμα δ᾽ ἐὰν σπείρῃς, μετὰ τοῦ γεννήματος τοῦ ἀμπελωνός σου.
**10** Οὐχ ἀροτριάσεις ἐν μόσχῳ καὶ ὄνῳ ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό.
**11** Οὐκ ἐνδύσῃ κίβδηλον, ἔρια καὶ λίνον ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό.
**12** Στρεπτά ποιήσεις σεαυτῷ ἐπὶ τῶν τεσσάρων κρασπέδων τῶν περιβολαίων σου ἃ ἂν περιβάλῃ ἐν αὐτοῖς.
**13** Ἐὰν δέ τις λάβῃ γυναῖκα καὶ συνοικήσῃ αὐτῇ,
**14** καὶ μισήσῃ αὐτήν, καὶ ἐπιθῇ αὐτῇ προφασιστικοὺς λόγους, καὶ κατενέγκῃ αὐτῆς ὄνομα πονηρόν, καὶ λέγῃ· τὴν γυναῖκα ταύτην εἴληφα, καὶ προσελθὼν αὐτῇ, οὐχ εὕρηκα αὐτῆς τὰ παρθένια,
**15** καὶ λαβὼν ὁ πατὴρ τῆς παιδὸς καὶ ἡ μήτηρ, ἐξοίσουσι τὰ παρθένια τῆς παιδὸς πρὸς τὴν γερουσίαν τῆς πόλεως ἐπὶ τὴν πύλην·
**16** καὶ ἐρεῖ ὁ πατὴρ τῆς παιδὸς τῇ γερουσίᾳ·
**17** τὴν θυγατέρα μου ταύτην ἔδωκα τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ τούτῳ γυναῖκα, καὶ μισήσας αὐτήν, αὐτὸς νῦν ἐπιτίθησιν αὐτῇ προφασιστικοὺς λόγους, λέγων· οὐχ εὕρηκα τῇ θυγατρί σου παρθένια· καὶ ταῦτα τὰ παρθένια τῆς θυγατρός μου· καὶ ἀναπτύξουσι τὸ ἱμάτιον ἔναντι τῆς γερουσίας τῆς πόλεως (ἐκείνης).
**18** Καὶ λήψεται ἡ γερουσία τῆς πόλεως ἐκείνης τὸν ἄνθρωπον ἐκεῖνον,
**19** καὶ παιδεύσουσιν αὐτόν, καὶ ζημιώσουσιν αὐτὸν ἑκατὸν σίκλους, καὶ δώσουσι τῷ πατρὶ τῆς νεάνιδος, ὅτι ἐξήνεγκεν ὄνομα πονηρὸν ἐπὶ παρθένον Ἰσραηλίτιν, καὶ αὐτοῦ ἔσται γυνή· οὐ δυνήσεται ἐξαποστεῖλαι αὐτὴν τὸν ἅπαντα χρόνον αὐτοῦ.
**20** Ἐὰν δὲ ἐπ᾽ ἀληθείας γένηται ὁ λόγος οὗτος, καὶ

*OCR corrections made:*
1.  **τὰ δ᾽ ἀδελφός σου** was corrected to **τὰ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου** in Deuteronomy 22:2/3. This was a necessary correction for grammatical sense, as "τὰ δ᾽ ἀδελφός σου" is ungrammatical and "τὰ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου" aligns with the base text (Grabe 1707) and standard Septuagint readings for this verse, which refers to "the [things] of thy brother."
2.  **ἀπολῆται** was changed to **ἀπόληται** (diacritic).
3.  **ὑπερϊδεῖν** was changed to **ὑπεριδεῖν** (trema removed).
4.  **ποι- ήσεις** (twice) was joined to **ποιήσεις** (spacing).
5.  **εἴ- ληφα** was joined to **εἴληφα** (spacing).
6.  **λόγ- ους** was joined to **λόγους** (spacing).
7.  **τῆς πό- λεως** was joined to **τῆς πόλεως** (spacing).
The verse number '3' was moved to the beginning of the sentence "Οὕτως ποιήσεις τὸν ὄνον αὐτοῦ..." for clarity, aligning with common English verse numbering. The preceding phrase remains unnumbered, as it completes the thought of the previous verse.

**DEUTERONOMY CHAPTER 22**

...[the lost things] of thy brother; and thou shalt restore them to him.

**3** In like manner shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou do with his raiment; and with every lost thing of thy brother, whatsoever shall be lost from him, and thou findest them, thou shalt not be able to overlook them.

**4** Thou shalt not see the ass of thy brother, nor his ox, fallen on the way, and disregard them; thou shalt surely help him lift them up.

**5** There shall not be the garments of a man upon a woman, neither shall a man put on a woman's apparel; for an abomination unto the Lord thy God is every one that doeth these things.

**6** If thou shouldst meet a bird's nest before thy face on the way, or upon any tree, or upon the earth, with young birds or with eggs, and the mother doth brood upon the young birds or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the mother with the young.

**7** Thou shalt surely send away the mother, but the young thou mayest take for thyself, that it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live many days.

**8** When thou buildest a new house, then shalt thou make a battlement for thy roof, and thou shalt not bring about murder in thy house, if one should fall, having fallen from it.

**9** Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with diverse seeds, lest the produce be rendered holy [or forbidden], and the seed also which thou sowest, along with the produce of thy vineyard.

**10** Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together.

**11** Thou shalt not wear a mixed garment, [that is,] wool and linen together.

**12** Thou shalt make for thyself twisted fringes upon the four corners of thy cloaks, which thou mayest wrap about thee therewith.

**13** If a man shall take a wife and lie with her,

**14** and hate her, and lay upon her pretextual words, and bring a bad name upon her, and say: 'I have taken this woman, and having come near to her, I have not found her virginity,'

**15** then shall the father of the maiden and her mother take and bring forth the tokens of the maiden's virginity unto the elders of the city at the gate.

**16** And the father of the maiden shall say unto the elders:

**17** 'I gave my daughter to this man to be his wife, and hating her, he himself now layeth upon her pretextual words, saying: "I have not found virginity in thy daughter." And these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity.' And they shall spread out the garment before the elders of that city.

**18** And the elders of that city shall take that man,

**19** and chastise him, and shall fine him one hundred shekels [of silver], and they shall give them to the father of the young woman, because he brought forth an evil name upon an Israelite virgin. And she shall be his wife; he shall not be able to send her away all his days.

**20** But if this word be true, and
