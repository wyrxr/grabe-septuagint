17 καὶ τὸν Ἀμοῤῥαῖον, καὶ τὸν Γεργεσαῖον, καὶ τὸν Εὐαῖον, καὶ τὸν
   Ἀρουκκαῖον, καὶ τὸν Ἀσενναῖον, καὶ τὸν Ἀράδιον, καὶ τὸν Σαμαραῖον,
18 καὶ τὸν Ἀμαθί. Καὶ μετὰ τοῦτο διεσπάρησαν αἱ φυλαὶ τῶν Χαναναίων˙
   καὶ ἐγένοντο τὰ ὅρια Χαναὰν ἀπὸ Σιδῶνος ἕως ἐλθεῖν εἰς Γεραρὰ καὶ
19 Γαζᾶν, ἕως ἐλθεῖν ἕως Σοδόμων καὶ Γομόῤῥας, Ἀδαμὰ καὶ Σεβωίμ,
20 ἕως Λασά. Οὗτοι υἱοὶ Χὰμ ἐν ταῖς φυλαῖς αὐτῶν, κατὰ γλώσσας
21 αὐτῶν, ἐν ταῖς χώραις αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν αὐτῶν. Καὶ τῷ Σὴμ
   ἐγενήθη καὶ αὐτῷ πατρὶ πάντων τῶν υἱῶν Ἕβερ, ἀδελφῷ Ἰάφεθ τοῦ
22 μείζονος. Υἱοὶ Σήμ· Αἰλάμ, καὶ Ἀσσούρ, καὶ Ἀῤῥαξάδ, καὶ Λούδ,
23 καὶ Ἀράμ. Καὶ υἱοὶ Ἀράμ· Ὤζ, καὶ Οὔλ, καὶ Γαθὲρ καὶ Μοσόχ˙
24 καὶ Ἀῤῥαξὰδ ἐγέννησε Καϊνάμ˙ καὶ Καϊνὰμ ἐγέννησε τὸν Σαλά.
25 Σαλὰ δὲ ἐγέννησε τὸν Ἕβερ. Καὶ τῷ Ἕβερ ἐγεννήθησαν δύο υἱοί˙
   ὄνομα τῷ ἑνὶ Φαλὲγ, ὅτι ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις αὐτοῦ διεμερίσθη ἡ γῆ˙
26 καὶ ὄνομα τῷ ἀδελφῷ αὐτοῦ, Ἰεκτάν. Ἰεκτὰν δὲ ἐγέννησε τὸν
27 Ἑλμωδάδ, καὶ τὸν Σαλέφ, καὶ τὸν Ἀσαρμώθ, καὶ Ἰαράδ, καὶ
28 Ὀδοῤῥά, καὶ Αἰζὴλ, καὶ Δεκλᾶ, καὶ Εὐὰλ, καὶ Ἀβιμεὴλ, καὶ Σαβεὺ,
29 καὶ Οὐφείρ, καὶ Εὐειλὰ, καὶ Ἰωβάβ. Πάντες οὗτοι υἱοὶ Ἰεκτάν.
30 Καὶ ἐγένετο ἡ κατοίκησις αὐτῶν ἀπὸ Μασσηὲ ἕως ἐλθεῖν εἰς Σωφηρά,
31 ὄρος ἀνατολῶν. Οὗτοι οἱ υἱοὶ Σήμ, ἐν ταῖς φυλαῖς αὐτῶν, κατὰ
   γλώσσας αὐτῶν, ἐν ταῖς χώραις αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν αὐτῶν.
32 Αὗται αἱ φυλαὶ υἱῶν Νῶε κατὰ γενέσεις αὐτῶν, κατὰ τὰ ἔθνη
   αὐτῶν˙ ἀπὸ τούτων διεσπάρησαν νῆσοι τῶν ἐθνῶν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς μετὰ
33 τὸν κατακλυσμόν.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΑ΄.

1 ΚΑΙ ἦν πᾶσα ἡ γῆ χεῖλος ἕν, καὶ φωνὴ μία πᾶσι.
2 Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ κινῆσαι αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν, εὗρον πεδίον ἐν γῇ
   Σενναὰρ, καὶ κατώκησαν ἐκεῖ.
3 Καὶ εἶπεν ἄνθρωπος τῷ πλησίον αὐτοῦ· δεῦτε πλινθεύσωμεν πλίνθους,
   καὶ ὀπτήσωμεν αὐτὰς πυρί·
4 καὶ ἐγένετο αὐτοῖς ἡ πλίνθος εἰς λίθον, καὶ ἄσφαλτος ἦν αὐτοῖς ὁ
   πηλός.
5 Καὶ εἶπαν· δεῦτε οἰκοδομήσωμεν ἑαυτοῖς πόλιν καὶ πύργον, οὗ ἡ
6 κεφαλὴ ἔσται ἕως τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ ποιήσωμεν ἑαυτῶν ὄνομα,
7 πρὸ τοῦ διασπαρῆναι ἐπὶ προσώπου πάσης τῆς γῆς.
8 Καὶ κατέβη Κύριος ἰδεῖν τὴν πόλιν καὶ τὸν πύργον, ὃν ᾠκοδόμησαν οἱ

**Genesis 10**

17 And the Amorite, and the Gergesite, and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite, and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, 18 and the Hamathite. And after this were the tribes of the Canaanites dispersed; and the borders of Canaan became from Sidon, as thou comest unto Gerara and Gaza; as thou comest unto Sodom and Gomorrah, Adama and Seboim, unto Lasha. 20 These were the sons of Ham, in their tribes, according to their tongues, in their lands, and in their nations.

21 And unto Shem also, the father of all the sons of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, were [sons] born. 22 The sons of Shem: Elam, and Assur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram. 23 And the sons of Aram: Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mashoch. 24 And Arphaxad begat Cainan; and Cainan begat Salah. 25 And Salah begat Eber. And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of the one was Peleg, because in his days was the earth divided; 26 and the name of his brother was Joktan. 27 And Joktan begat Elmodad, and Salaph, and Asarmoth, and Jarad, 28 and Odorra, and Ezel, and Decla, and Eval, and Abimael, and Saba, 29 and Ophir, and Evila, and Jobab. All these were the sons of Joktan. 30 And their dwelling was from Massa, as thou comest unto Sophira, a mountain of the East. 31 These are the sons of Shem, in their tribes, according to their tongues, in their lands, and in their nations.

32 These are the tribes of the sons of Noah, according to their generations, according to their nations: 33 from these were the Isles of the Nations dispersed upon the earth after the flood.

**Genesis 11**

1 AND the whole earth was of one lip, and all had one speech. 2 And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they dwelt there. 3 And a man said unto his neighbor, saying, Come, let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly with fire. 4 And the brick served them for stone, and asphalt did they use for mortar. 5 And they said, Come, let us build for ourselves a city and a tower, 6 whose top shall reach unto heaven; and let us make for ourselves a name, 7 before we be dispersed upon the face of all the earth. 8 And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the
