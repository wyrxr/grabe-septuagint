### ΕΞΟΔΟΣ ΚΕΦ. Ι΄.
21 σραὴλ. Εἶπε δὲ Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, ἔκτεινον τὴν χεῖρά σου εἰς
22 τὸν οὐρανόν, καὶ γενηθήτω σκότος ἐπὶ γῆν Αἰγύπτου, ψηλαφητὸν
   σκότος. Ἐξέτεινε δὲ Μωυσῆς τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν,
23 καὶ ἐγένετο σκότος, γνόφος, θύελλα ἐπὶ πᾶσαν γῆν Αἰγύπτου τρεῖς
   ἡμέρας· καὶ οὐκ ἴδεν οὐδεὶς τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὑτοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἀνέστη·
   οὐδεὶς ἐκ τῆς κοίτης αὑτοῦ τρεῖς ἡμέρας· πᾶσι δὲ τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραὴλ
24 ἦν φῶς ἐν πᾶσιν οἷς κατεγίνοντο. Καὶ ἐκάλεσε Φαραὼ
   Μωυσῆν καὶ Ἀαρών, λέγων· Βαδίζετε, λατρεύσατε Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ
   ὑμῶν· πλὴν τῶν προβάτων καὶ τῶν βοῶν ὑμῶν ὑπολείπεσθε, καὶ
25 ἡ ἀποσκευὴ ὑμῶν ἀποτρεχέτω μεθ᾽ ὑμῶν. Καὶ εἶπε Μωυσῆς· Ἀλλά·
   καὶ σὺ δώσεις ἡμῖν ὁλοκαυτώματα καὶ θυσίας, ἃ ποιήσωμεν Κυρίῳ
26 τῷ Θεῷ ἡμῶν· καὶ τὰ κτήνη ἡμῶν πορεύσεται μεθ᾽ ἡμῶν, καὶ
   οὐχ ὑπολειψόμεθα ἐκ πλὴν· ἀπ᾽ αὐτῶν γὰρ ληψόμεθα λατρεῦσαι Κυρίῳ
   τῷ Θεῷ ἡμῶν· ἡμεῖς δὲ οὐκ οἴδαμεν τί λατρεύσομεν Κυρίῳ
27 τῷ Θεῷ ἡμῶν, ἕως τοῦ ἐλθεῖν ἡμᾶς ἐκεῖ. Ἐσκλήρυνε δὲ Κύριος
28 τὴν καρδίαν Φαραώ, καὶ οὐκ ἐβουλήθη ἐξαποστεῖλαι αὐτούς. Καὶ
   λέγει αὐτῷ Φαραώ· Ἄπελθε ἀπ᾽ ἐμοῦ, πρόσεχε σεαυτῷ ἔτι προσθεῖναι
29 ἰδεῖν μου τὸ πρόσωπον· ἢ δ᾽ ἂν ἡμέρᾳ ὀφθῆς μοι, ἀποθανῇ. Λέγει
   δὲ Μωυσῆς· Καθὼς εἴρηκας, οὐκ ἔτι ὀφθήσομαί σοι εἰς πρόσωπον.

### ΚΕΦ. ΙΑ΄.
1 Εἶπε δὲ Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν· Ἔτι μίαν πληγὴν ἐπάξω ἐπὶ
  Φαραὼ καὶ ἐπ᾽ Αἴγυπτον, καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα ἐξαποστελεῖ ὑμᾶς· ἐντεῦθεν
  ὅταν δὲ ἀποστέλλῃ ὑμᾶς σὺν παντί, ἐκβολῇ ἐκβαλεῖ ὑμᾶς.
2 Λάλησον οὖν κρυφῇ εἰς τὰ ὦτα τοῦ λαοῦ, καὶ αἰτησάτω ἕκαστος
  παρὰ τοῦ πλησίον αὐτοῦ, καὶ γυνὴ παρὰ τῆς πλησίον αὑτῆς, σκεύη
3 ἀργυρᾶ καὶ χρυσᾶ καὶ ἱματισμόν. Κύριος δὲ ἔδωκε τὴν χάριν τῷ
  λαῷ αὐτοῦ ἐναντίον τῶν Αἰγυπτίων, καὶ ἐχρησαν αὐτοῖς· καὶ ὁ
  ἄνθρωπος Μωυσῆς μέγας ἐγενήθη σφόδρα ἐναντίον τῶν Αἰγυπτίων,
  καὶ ἐναντίον Φαραώ, καὶ ἐναντίον τῶν θεραπόντων αὐτοῦ,
4 καὶ ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ. Καὶ εἶπε Μωυσῆς· Τάδε λέγει
  Κύριος· Περὶ μέσας νύκτας ἐγὼ εἰσπορεύομαι εἰς μέσον Αἰγύπτου.
5 Καὶ τελευτήσει πᾶν πρωτότοκον ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ, ἀπὸ πρωτοτόκου
  Φαραώ, ὃς κάθηται ἐπὶ τοῦ θρόνου, ἕως τοῦ πρωτοτόκου
  τῆς θεραπαίνης τῆς παρὰ τὸν μύλον, καὶ ἕως πρωτοτόκου παντὸς

### EXODUS CHAPTER 10

**21** [Srael]. And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth your hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness upon the land of Egypt, even a darkness which may be felt.
**22** And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and it came to pass, there was darkness, a thick mist, and a tempest over all the land of Egypt for three days.
**23** And no man saw his brother, neither did any rise up from his bed for three days; but for all the children of Israel, there was light in all their dwellings wherein they abode.
**24** And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron, saying, Go, serve the LORD your God; but your sheep and your cattle, these shall you leave behind; and your baggage shall speed forth with you.
**25** And Moses said, But; you also shall give unto us burnt offerings and sacrifices, which we shall offer unto the LORD our God.
**26** And our cattle shall go with us; and we shall leave nothing of them behind, save that from among them shall we take to serve the LORD our God; for we know not what we shall serve the LORD our God with, until we come thither.
**27** But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not send them forth.
**28** And Pharaoh said unto him, Get you from me; take heed to yourself that you add not again to see my face; for in whatsoever day you appear before me, you shall surely die.
**29** And Moses said, As you have spoken, I shall see your face no more.

### CHAPTER 11

**1** Moreover, the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more upon Pharaoh and upon Egypt; and after that, he shall send you forth. Thenceforth, when he sends you forth with all [your company], he shall utterly drive you out.
**2** Speak now in secret unto the ears of the people, and let every man ask of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver and jewels of gold, and raiment.
**3** And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, and they lent unto them; and the man Moses became very great in the sight of the Egyptians, and in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants,
**4** and in the eyes of all the people. And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD: About midnight I will go forth into the midst of Egypt.
**5** And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the handmaid who is by the mill, and unto the firstborn of all...
