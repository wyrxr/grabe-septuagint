**5** Καὶ προκατελάβοντο ἄνδρες Γαλαὰδ τὰς διαβάσεις τοῦ Ἰορδάνου τοῦ Ἐφραίμ· καὶ ἐγενήθη ὅτε εἶπαν οἱ διασεσωσμένοι τοῦ Ἐφραὶμ· διαβῶμεν, καὶ εἶπαν αὐτοῖς οἱ ἄνδρες Γαλαὰδ· μὴ ὑμεῖς ἐκ τοῦ Ἐφραίμ; καὶ εἶπαν οὐκ ἐσμέν.
**6** Καὶ εἶπον αὐτοῖς· εἴπατε δὴ σύνθημα. Καὶ εἶπον, καὶ οὐ κατήθυναν τοῦ λαλῆσαι οὕτως· καὶ ἐπελάθοντο αὐτῶν, καὶ σφάζουσιν αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ τὰς διαβάσεις τοῦ Ἰορδάνου· καὶ ἔπεσαν ἐξ Ἐφραὶμ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ δύο καὶ τεσσαράκοντα χιλιάδες ἀνδρῶν. Καὶ ἔκρινεν Ἰεφθάε τὸν Ἰσραὴλ ἓξ ἔτη·

**11** Καὶ ἔκρινε μετ᾿ αὐτὸν τὸν Ἰσραὴλ Αἰλὼν ὁ Ζαβουλωνίτης, καὶ ἔκρινε τὸν Ἰσραὴλ δέκα ἔτη.
**12** Καὶ ἀπέθανεν Αἰλὼν ὁ Ζαβουλωνίτης ἐν Αἰλεὶμ, καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν ἐν γῇ Ζαβουλών.
**13** Καὶ ἔκρινε μετ᾿ αὐτὸν τὸν Ἰσραὴλ Λαβδὼμ υἱὸς Ἑλλὴλ ὁ Φρααθωνίτης.
**14** Καὶ ἐγένετο αὐτῷ τεσσαράκοντα υἱοί, καὶ τριάκοντα υἱοὶ τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ, ἐπιβεβηκότες ἐπὶ ἑβδομήκοντα πώλους· καὶ ἔκρινε τὸν Ἰσραὴλ ὀκτὼ ἔτη.
**15** Καὶ ἀπέθανε Λαβδὼμ υἱὸς Ἑλλὴλ ὁ Φρααθωνίτης, καὶ ἐτάφη ἐν Φρααλὼν ἐν γῇ Ἐφραὶμ, ἐν ὄρει Λανάκ.

**1** ΚΑΙ προσέθεντο οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ποιῆσαι τὸ πονηρὸν ἐναντίον Κυρίου· καὶ παρέδωκεν αὐτοὺς Κύριος ἐν χειρὶ ἀλλοφύλων τεσσαράκοντα ἔτη·
**2** Καὶ ἐγένετο ἀνὴρ εἷς ἐκ Σαραὰ, ἐκ τῆς φυλῆς τοῦ Δὰν, καὶ ὄνομα αὐτῷ Μανωέ· καὶ ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ στεῖρα, καὶ οὐκ ἔτικτε.
**3** Καὶ ὤφθη ἄγγελος Κυρίου πρὸς τὴν γυναῖκα, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτήν· Ἰδοὺ δὴ σὺ στεῖρα καὶ οὐ τέτοκας, καὶ ἐν γαστρὶ ἕξεις, καὶ τέξῃ υἱόν.
**4** Καὶ νῦν φύλαξαι, καὶ μὴ πίῃς οἶνον καὶ σίκερα, καὶ μὴ φάγῃς πᾶν ἀκάθαρτον·
