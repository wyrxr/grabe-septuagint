ΚΕΦ. ΙΖʹ. ΙΗΣΟΥΣ ΝΑΥΗ 407
Νουά, καὶ Αἰγλά, καὶ Μελχά, καὶ Θερσά. Καὶ ἔστησαν ἐναντί- 4
ον Ἐλεάζαρ τοῦ ἱερέως, καὶ ἐναντίον Ἰησοῦ υἱοῦ Ναυῆ, καὶ ἐναν-
τίων τῶν ἀρχόντων, λέγουσαι· (2) ὁ Θεὸς ἐνετείλατο διὰ χειρὸς
Μωυσῆ, δοῦναι ἡμῖν κληρονομίαν ἐν μέσῳ τῶν ἀδελφῶν ἡμῶν.
Καὶ ἐδόθη αὐταῖς κλῆρος διὰ προστάγματος Κυρίου ἐν τοῖς ἀδελ-
φοῖς τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἔπεσεν ὁ σχοινισμὸς Μανασσῆ πεδίον 5
Λαβὲκ ἐκ γῆς Γαλαὰδ καὶ τῆς Βασάν, ἡ ἐστι πέραν τοῦ Ἰορ-
δάνου· ὅτι θυγατέρες υἱῶν Μανασσῆ ἐκληρονόμησαν κλῆρον ἐν μέ- 6
σῳ τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτῶν· ἡ δὲ γῆ Γαλαὰδ ἐγενήθη τοῖς υἱοῖς Μα-
νασσῆ τοῖς καταλελειμμένοις. Καὶ ἐγενήθη ὅρια υἱῶν Μανασσῆ ἀπὸ 7
᾿Ασὴρ Μαχθώθ, ἥ ἐστι κατὰ πρόσωπον Συχέμ, καὶ πορεύεται τὰ
ὅρια ἐπὶ Ἰαμὶν καὶ εἰς Ἰασὴρ ἐπὶ πηγὴν Θαφθώθ. Τῷ Μανασσῆ 8
ἔσται γῆ Θαφθώθ· καὶ Θαφθὼθ ἐπὶ τῶν ὁρίων Μανασσῆ τοῖς υἱ-
οῖς Ἐφραΐμ. Καὶ καταβήσεται τὰ ὅρια ἐπὶ φάραγγα Κανὰ ἐπὶ λίβα 9
κατὰ τὴν φάραγγα Ἰαφείμ· ἡ τερέβινθος τῷ Ἐφραΐμ ἀναμέσον πόλεως
Μανασσῆ. Καὶ ὅρια Μανασσῆ ἐπὶ βορρᾶ εἰς τὸν χειμάρρουν, καὶ ἔσται
αὐτοῦ ἡ διέξοδος θάλασσα· ἀπὸ λιβὸς τῷ Ἐφραΐμ, καὶ ἐπὶ βορρᾶν τῷ 10
Μανασσῆ· καὶ ἔσται ἡ θάλασσα ὅρια αὐτοῖς. Καὶ ἐπὶ ᾿Ασὴρ συν-
άγουσιν ἐπὶ βορρᾶν, καὶ τῷ Ἰσσάχαρ ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν· καὶ ἔσται 11
Μανασσῆ ἐν Ἰσσάχαρ καὶ ἐν ᾿Ασὴρ Βαιθσὰν καὶ αἱ κῶμαι αὐ-
τῶν, καὶ Ἰεβλαὰμ καὶ θυγατέρες αὐτῆς, καὶ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας
Δώρ, καὶ τὰς κώμας αὐτῆς, καὶ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας Ἐνδὼρ καὶ τὰς
κώμας αὐτῆς, καὶ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας Μαγεδδὼ, καὶ τὰς κώμας
αὐτῆς, καὶ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας Τανάχ καὶ τὰς κώμας αὐτῆς, καὶ
τὸ τρίτον τῆς Ναφεθὰ, καὶ τὰς κώμας αὐτῆς. Καὶ οὐκ ἠδυνήθη- 12
σαν οἱ υἱοὶ Μανασσῆ ἐξολοθρεῦσαι τὰς πόλεις ταύτας· καὶ ἤρξα-
το ὁ Χαναναῖος κατοικεῖν ἐν τῇ γῇ ταύτῃ. Καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐπεὶ κα- 13
τίσχυσαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐποίησαν τοὺς Χαναναίους ὑπηκό-
ους, ἐξολοθρεῦσαι δὲ αὐτοὺς οὐκ ἐξωλόθρευσαν. ᾿Αντεῖπαν δὲ οἱ υἱοὶ 14
Ἰωσὴφ τῷ Ἰησοῦ, λέγοντες· διατὶ ἐκληρονόμησας ἡμᾶς κληρονο-
μίαν κλῆρον ἕνα, καὶ σχοίνισμα ἕν; ἐγὼ δὲ λαὸς πολύς (εἰμί),
καὶ ὁ Θεός με ηὐλόγησε. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς Ἰησοῦς· εἰ λαὸς πο- 15
λὺς εἶ σύ, ἀνάβηθι εἰς τὸν δρυμόν, καὶ ἐκκαθάρισον σεαυτῷ ἐκεῖ
ἐν τῇ γῇ τοὺς Φερεζαίους καὶ τοὺς Ραφαείμ, εἰ στενοχωρεῖ σε
τὸ ὄρος Ἐφραΐμ. Καὶ εἶπαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰωσήφ· οὐκ ἀρκεῖ ἡμῖν 16
τὸ ὄρος τὸ Ἐφραΐμ· καὶ ἵππος ἐπίλεκτος, καὶ σίδηρος παντὶ τῷ

**Joshua 17**

<sup>3</sup> Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah.
<sup>4</sup> And they stood before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying: The Lord did command through the hand of Moses, to give unto us an inheritance among our brethren. And there was given unto them a lot by the command of the Lord, among the brethren of their father.
<sup>5</sup> And the measuring-line for Manasseh did fall upon the plain of Labek, out of the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan.
<sup>6</sup> For the daughters of the children of Manasseh did inherit a lot among their brethren; but the land of Gilead was given unto the children of Manasseh who were remaining.
<sup>7</sup> And the borders of the children of Manasseh were from Asher Makhtoth, which is before Shechem; and the borders did go forth unto Jamin and unto Jasher, unto the spring of Tappuah.
<sup>8</sup> Unto Manasseh shall be the land of Tappuah; but Tappuah shall be upon the borders of Manasseh, for the children of Ephraim.
<sup>9</sup> And the borders shall go down unto the Wadi Kanah, to the south according to the Wadi Japhie; the terebinth tree shall be for Ephraim, amidst the city of Manasseh.

<sup>12</sup> Yet the children of Manasseh were not able to dispossess these cities; and the Canaanite began to dwell in that land.
<sup>13</sup> And it came to pass, when the children of Israel did grow strong, that they made the Canaanites tributary; but they did not utterly dispossess them.
<sup>14</sup> And the children of Joseph did contend with Joshua, saying: Wherefore hast thou given us to inherit one inheritance, and one lot, and one portion by line? seeing I am a numerous people, and the Lord hath blessed me.
<sup>15</sup> And Joshua said unto them: If thou art a numerous people, go up into the woodland, and clear out for thyself there in the land the Perizzites and the Rephaim, if the mount of Ephraim be too narrow for thee.
<sup>16</sup> And the children of Joseph said: The mount of Ephraim sufficeth us not; for there is also a choice horse, and iron, unto all the
