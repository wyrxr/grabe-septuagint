ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ ΚΕΦ. ΜΒ΄.
Χαναάν· καὶ ἰδοὺ ὁ νεώτερος μετὰ τοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν σήμερον·
14 ὃ δὲ ἕτερος οὐχ ὑπάρχει. Εἶπε δὲ αὐτοῖς Ἰωσὴφ· τοῦτό ἐστιν ὃ
15 εἴρηκα ὑμῖν, λέγων, ὅτι κατάσκοποι ἔστε. Ἐν τούτῳ φανεῖσθε· νὴ
τὴν ὑγείαν Φαραὼ, οὐ μὴ ἐξέλθητε ἐντεῦθεν, ἐὰν μὴ ὁ ἀδελφὸς
16 ὑμῶν ὁ νεώτερος ἔλθῃ ὧδε. Ἀποστείλατε ἐξ ὑμῶν ἕνα, καὶ λαβέτω
τὸν ἀδελφὸν ὑμῶν· ὑμεῖς δὲ ἀπάχθητε ἕως τοῦ φανερὰ γενέσθαι
17 τὰ ῥήματα ὑμῶν, εἰ ἀληθεύετε ἢ οὔ· εἰ δὲ μὴ, νὴ τὴν
ὑγείαν Φαραὼ, ἢ μὴν κατάσκοποι ἔστε. Καὶ ἔθετο αὐτοὺς ἐν φυλακῇ
18 ἡμέρας τρεῖς. Εἶπε δὲ αὐτοῖς Ἰωσὴφ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τρίτῃ·
19 τοῦτο ποιήσατε, καὶ ζήσεσθε· τὸν Θεὸν γὰρ ἐγὼ φοβοῦμαι. Εἰ
εἰρηνικοί ἐστε, ἀδελφὸς ὑμῶν εἷς κατασχεθήτω ἐν τῇ φυλακῇ αὑτοῦ·
20 τὰ δὲ βρώσιμα, καὶ ἀπαγάγετε τὸν ἀγορασμὸν τῆς σιτοδοσίας ὑμῶν·
καὶ τὸν ἀδελφὸν ὑμῶν τὸν νεώτερον καταγάγετε πρός με,
καὶ πιστευθήσονται τὰ ῥήματα ὑμῶν· εἰ δὲ μὴ, ἀποθανεῖσθε. Ἐποίησαν
21 δὲ οὕτω. Καὶ εἶπεν ἕκαστος πρὸς τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὑτοῦ·
ναὶ, ἐν ἁμαρτίᾳ γὰρ ἐσμεν περὶ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ ἡμῶν, ὅτι ὑπερείδομεν
τὴν θλῖψιν τῆς ψυχῆς αὐτοῦ, ὅτε κατεδέετο ἡμῶν, καὶ οὐκ
εἰσηκούσαμεν αὐτοῦ· ἕνεκεν τούτου ἐπῆλθεν ἐφ᾽ ἡμᾶς ἡ θλῖψις αὕτη.
22 Ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ Ῥουβὴν, εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· οὐκ ἐλάλησα ὑμῖν, λέγων·
μὴ ἀδικήσητε τὸ παιδάριον; καὶ οὐκ εἰσηκούσατέ μου· καὶ
23 ἰδοὺ τὸ αἷμα αὐτοῦ ἐκζητεῖται. Αὐτοὶ δὲ οὐκ ᾔδεισαν ὅτι ἀκούει
24 Ἰωσήφ· ὁ γὰρ ἑρμηνευτὴς ἀνὰ μέσον αὐτῶν ἦν. Ἀποστραφεὶς δὲ
ἀπ᾽ αὐτῶν, ἐκλαυσεν Ἰωσήφ· καὶ πάλιν προσῆλθε πρὸς αὐτοὺς, καὶ
εἶπεν αὐτοῖς. Καὶ ἔλαβε τὸν Συμεὼν ἀπ᾽ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔδησεν αὐτὸν
25 ἐναντίον αὐτῶν. Ἐνετείλατο δὲ Ἰωσὴφ ἐμπλῆσαι τὰ ἀγγεῖα
αὐτῶν σίτου, καὶ ἀποδοῦναι τὸ ἀργύριον αὐτῶν ἑκάστῳ εἰς τὸν
σάκκον αὐτοῦ, καὶ δοῦναι αὐτοῖς ἐπισιτισμὸν εἰς τὴν ὁδόν· καὶ ἐγενήθη
26 αὐτοῖς οὕτω. Καὶ ἐπιθέντες τὸν σῖτον ἐπὶ τοὺς ὄνους αὑτῶν,
27 ἀπῆλθον ἐκεῖθεν. Λύσας δὲ εἷς τὸν μάρσιππον αὑτοῦ, δοῦναι
χορτάσματα τοῖς ὄνοις αὐτοῦ, οὗ κατέλυσαν, ἴδε τὸν δεσμὸν τοῦ
28 ἀργυρίου αὑτοῦ, καὶ ἦν ἐπάνω τοῦ στόματος τοῦ μαρσίππου. Καὶ
εἶπε τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς αὑτοῦ· ἀπεδόθη μοι τὸ ἀργύριον, καὶ ἰδοὺ τοῦτο
ἐν τῷ μαρσίππῳ μου. Καὶ ἐξέστη ἡ καρδία αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐταράχθησαν
πρὸς ἀλλήλους λέγοντες· τί τοῦτο ἐποίησεν ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῖν;
29 Ἦλθον δὲ πρὸς Ἰακὼβ τὸν πατέρα αὐτῶν εἰς γῆν Χαναὰν, καὶ
30 ἀπήγγειλαν αὐτῷ πάντα τὰ συμβεβηκότα αὐτοῖς, λέγοντες· λελὰ-

### Genesis Chapter 42

...[in the] land of Canaan; and behold, the younger is with our father this day.
14 And the other is no more. Then Joseph said unto them, “This it is that I spake unto you, saying, ‘Ye are spies.’
15 By this shall ye be proved: [As surely as] Pharaoh liveth, ye shall not depart hence, unless your youngest brother come hither.
16 Send ye one from among you, and let him fetch your brother; but ye shall be kept in ward until your words be made manifest, whether ye speak truth or no.
17 But if not, [then, as surely as] Pharaoh liveth, ye are verily spies.” And he put them together in prison three days.
18 And Joseph said unto them the third day,
19 “Do this, and live: for I fear God. If ye be peaceable men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your ward;
20 and ye, take the provisions, and bear away the bought food for your households; and bring your youngest brother unto me, and your words shall be believed; but if not, ye shall die.” And they did so.
21 And each man said to his brother, “Verily, we are in sin concerning our brother, because we beheld the affliction of his soul, when he besought us, and we did not hearken unto him. For this cause is this affliction come upon us.”
22 And Reuben answered them, saying, “Did I not speak unto you, saying, ‘Do not harm the child?’ And ye would not hearken unto me; and behold, his blood is now required.”
23 But they knew not that Joseph understood [them],
24 for the interpreter was between them. And Joseph turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned again unto them, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.
25 Then Joseph commanded to fill their vessels with grain, and to restore every man’s money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way; and thus was it done unto them.
26 And they loaded the grain upon their asses, and departed thence.
27 And as one of them opened his sack to give fodder to his asses in the lodging place where they abode, he spied the bundle of his money,
28 and lo, it was in the mouth of his sack. And he said unto his brethren, “My money is restored unto me; and behold, it is even in my sack.” And their heart failed them, and they were troubled one with another, saying, “What is this that God hath done unto us?”
29 And they came unto Jacob their father into the land of Canaan,
30 and told him all that had befallen them, saying, “The man...”
