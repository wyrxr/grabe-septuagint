56 ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ. ΚΕΦ. ΛΑ´.
34 καὶ οὐχ εὗρεν· εἰσῆλθε δὲ καὶ εἰς τὸν οἶκον Ῥαχήλ. Ῥαχὴλ δὲ
    ἔλαβε τὰ εἴδωλα, καὶ ἐνέβαλεν αὐτὰ εἰς τὰ σάγματα τῆς καμή-
35 λου, καὶ ἐπεκάθισεν αὐτοῖς. Καὶ εἶπε τῷ πατρὶ αὐτῆς· μὴ βα-
    ρέως φέρε, κύριε· οὐ δύναμαι ἀναστῆναι ἐνώπιόν σου, ὅτι τὰ κατ᾿
    ἐθισμὸν τῶν γυναικῶν μοι ἐστίν. Ἠρεύνησε δὲ Λάβαν ἐν ὅλῳ
36 τῷ οἴκῳ καὶ οὐχ εὗρε τὰ εἴδωλα. Ὠργίσθη δὲ Ἰακὼβ καὶ ἐμα-
37 χέσατο τῷ Λάβαν. Ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ Ἰακὼβ, εἶπε τῷ Λάβαν· τί τὸ
37 ἀδίκημά μου καὶ τί τὸ ἁμάρτημά μου, ὅτι κατεδίωξας ὀπίσω μου,
    καὶ ὅτι ἠρεύνησας πάντα τὰ σκεύη τοῦ οἴκου μου; τί εὗρες ἀπὸ
    πάντων τῶν σκευῶν τοῦ οἴκου σου; θὲς ὧδε ἐναντίον τῶν ἀδελ-
    φῶν σου καὶ τῶν ἀδελφῶν μου, καὶ ἐλεγξάτωσαν ἀνὰ μέσον τῶν
38 δύο ἡμῶν. Ταῦτά μοι εἴκοσι ἔτη ἐγώ εἰμι μετὰ σοῦ· τὰ πρόβα-
    τά σου καὶ αἱ αἶγές σου οὐκ ἠτεκνώθησαν· κριοὺς τῶν προβάτων
39 σου οὐ κατέφαγον· θηριάλωτον οὐκ ἂν ἐνήνοχά σοι· ἐγὼ ἀπετίν-
    νυον ἀπ᾿ ἐμαυτοῦ κλέμματα ἡμέρας καὶ κλέμματα τῆς νυκτός.
40 Ἐγενόμην τῆς ἡμέρας συγκαίόμενος τῷ καύσωνι, καὶ παγετῷ τῆς
41 νυκτός· καὶ ἀφίστατο ὁ ὕπνος μου ἀπὸ τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν μου. Ταῦτά
    μοι εἴκοσι ἔτη ἐγώ εἰμι ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ σου· ἐδούλευσά σοι δέκα καὶ
    τέσσαρα ἔτη ἀντὶ τῶν δύο θυγατέρων σου, καὶ ἓξ ἔτη ἐν τοῖς
42 προβάτοις σου, καὶ παρελογίσω τὸν μισθόν μου δέκα μναῖς. Εἰ μὴ
    ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ πατρός μου Ἀβραὰμ, καὶ ὁ φόβος Ἰσαὰκ ἦν μοι, νῦν
    ἂν κενόν με ἐξαπέστειλας· τὴν ταπείνωσίν μου καὶ τὸν κόπον τῶν χει-
43 ρῶν μου ἴδεν ὁ Θεὸς, καὶ ἤλεγξέ σε χθές. Ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ Λάβαν,
    εἶπε τῷ Ἰακώβ· αἱ θυγατέρες σου θυγατέρες μου, καὶ υἱοί σου υἱοί μου,
    καὶ τὰ κτήνη σου κτήνη μου, καὶ πάντα ὅσα σὺ ὁρᾷς, ἐμά ἐστι· καὶ
    ταῖς θυγατράσι μου τί ποιήσω ταύταις σήμερον, ἢ τοῖς τέκνοις αὐτῶν
44 οἷς ἔτεκον; Νῦν οὖν δεῦρο διαθώμεθα διαθήκην ἐγὼ καὶ σὺ, καὶ
    ἔσται εἰς μαρτύριον ἀνὰ μέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ σοῦ. Εἶπε δὲ αὐτῷ Ἰα-
    κὼβ· Ἰδοὺ οὐθεὶς μεθ᾿ ἡμῶν ἐστιν· ἴδε ὁ Θεὸς μάρτυς ἀνὰ μέσον
45 ἐμοῦ καὶ σοῦ. Λαβὼν δὲ Ἰακὼβ λίθον, ἔστησεν αὐτὸν στήλην.
46 Εἶπε δὲ Ἰακὼβ τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς αὐτοῦ· συλλέγετε λίθους. Καὶ συ-
    νέλεξαν λίθους, καὶ ἐποίησαν βουνόν· καὶ ἔφαγον (καὶ ἔπιον) ἐκεῖ
47 ἐπὶ τοῦ βουνοῦ. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Λάβαν· ὁ βουνὸς οὗτος μαρτυρεῖ
48 ἀνὰ μέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ σοῦ σήμερον. Καὶ ἐκάλεσεν αὐτὸν Λάβαν,
    Βουνὸς τῆς μαρτυρίας· Ἰακὼβ δὲ ἐκάλεσεν αὐτὸν, Βουνὸς μαρ-
    τυρεῖ. (Εἶπε δὲ Λάβαν τῷ Ἰακὼβ· Ἰδοὺ ὁ βουνὸς οὗτος καὶ ἡ

<sup>34</sup> and he found them not. But he entered also into Rachel’s tent. And Rachel had taken the idols, and placed them in the camel’s saddlebags,

<sup>35</sup> and she sat upon them. And she said to her father, "Be not displeased, my lord, for I am not able to rise before you, because the custom of women is upon me." And Laban searched throughout all the tent, but he found not the idols.

<sup>36</sup> Then Jacob was wroth, and he contended with Laban.

<sup>37</sup> And Jacob answered and said to Laban, "What is my trespass, or what is my sin, that you have so hotly pursued after me? And that you have searched all the vessels of my house? What have you found of all the vessels of your own house? Place [it] here before your brethren and my brethren, and let them judge between us two.

<sup>38</sup> These twenty years have I been with you. Your sheep and your goats have not miscarried [their young], nor have I eaten the rams of your flock.

<sup>39</sup> That which was torn of beasts did I not bring to you; I bore the loss myself, whether it was stolen by day or stolen by night.

<sup>40</sup> In the day, I was consumed by the scorching heat, and by the frost of the night;

<sup>41</sup> and sleep departed from my eyes. These twenty years have I been in your house: I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock,

<sup>42</sup> and you changed my wages ten times. If the God of my father Abraham, and the Fear of Isaac, had not been with me, surely you would have sent me away empty. The Lord has beheld my affliction and the labor of my hands,

<sup>43</sup> and has rebuked you yesternight." And Laban answered and said to Jacob, "The daughters are my daughters, and the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine. And what shall I do this day to these my daughters, or to their children whom they have borne?"

<sup>44</sup> "Now therefore come, let us make a covenant, I and you, and it shall be for a witness between me and you." And Jacob said to him, "Behold, there is no man with us [here]; behold, God is witness between me and you."

<sup>45</sup> And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.

<sup>46</sup> And Jacob said to his brethren, "Gather stones." And they gathered stones, and made a heap; and they ate (and they drank) there upon the heap.

<sup>47</sup> And Laban said to him, "This heap is witness between me and you this day."

<sup>48</sup> And Laban called its name, The Heap of Witness; but Jacob called its name, The Heap does Witness. (And Laban said to Jacob, "Behold this heap, and the—
