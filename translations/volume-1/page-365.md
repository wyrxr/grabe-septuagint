21 μὴ εὑρεθῇ παρθενία τῇ νεάνιδι, καὶ ἐξάξουσι τὴν νεᾶνιν ἐπὶ τὰς
     θύρας οἴκου πατρὸς αὐτῆς, καὶ λιθοβολήσουσιν αὐτὴν οἱ ἄνδρες
     τῆς πόλεως αὐτῆς ἐν λίθοις, καὶ ἀποθανεῖται, ὅτι ἐποίησεν ἀφρο-
     σύνην ἐν υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ, ἐκπορνεῦσαι τὸν οἶκον τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῆς·
22 καὶ ἐξαρεῖς τὸν πονηρὸν ἐξ ὑμῶν αὐτῶν. Ἐὰν δὲ εὑρεθῇ ἄνθρω-
     πος κοιμώμενος μετὰ γυναικὸς συνῳκισμένης ἀνδρί, ἀποκτενεῖτε
     ἅμα ἀμφοτέρους, τόν τε ἄνδρα τὸν κοιμώμενον μετὰ τῆς γυναι-
23 κός, καὶ τὴν γυναῖκα· καὶ ἐξαρεῖς τὸν πονηρὸν ἐξ Ἰσραήλ. Ἐὰν
     δὲ γένηται παῖς παρθένος μεμνηστευμένη ἀνδρί, καὶ εὑρὼν αὐτὴν
24 ἄνθρωπος ἐν πόλει, κοιμηθῇ μετ' αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐξάξετε ἀμφοτέρους
     ἐπὶ τὴν πύλην τῆς πόλεως αὐτῶν, καὶ λιθοβοληθήσονται ἐν λίθοις,
     καὶ ἀποθανοῦνται· τὴν νεᾶνιν, ἐπὶ λόγου ὅτι οὐκ ἐβόησεν ἐν τῇ
     πόλει, καὶ τὸν ἄνθρωπον, ἐπὶ λόγου ὅτι ἐταπείνωσε τὴν γυναῖκα
25 τοῦ πλησίον αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐξαρεῖς τὸν πονηρὸν ἐξ ὑμῶν αὐτῶν. Ἐὰν
     δὲ ἐν πεδίῳ εὕρῃ ἄνθρωπος τὴν παῖδα τὴν μεμνηστευμένην, καὶ
     βιασάμενος κοιμηθῇ μετ' αὐτῆς, ἀποκτενεῖτε τὸν ἄνθρωπον τὸν
26 κοιμώμενον μετ' αὐτῆς μόνον· τῇ δὲ νεάνιδι οὐ ποιήσετε οὐδέν·
     οὐκ ἔστι τῇ νεάνιδι ἁμάρτημα θανάτου· ὅτι ὡσεὶ τις ἐπαναστῇ
     ἄνθρωπος ἐπὶ τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ, καὶ φονεύσῃ αὐτοῦ ψυχήν, οὕ-
27 τως τὸ πρᾶγμα τοῦτο· ὅτι ἐν τῷ ἀγρῷ εὗρεν αὐτήν, ἐβόησεν ἡ
     νεᾶνις ἡ μεμνηστευμένη, καὶ ὁ βοηθῶν οὐκ ἔστιν αὐτῇ. Ἐὰν δέ
     τις εὕρῃ τὴν παῖδα τὴν παρθένον, ἥτις οὐ μεμνήστευται, καὶ βια-
28 σάμενος αὐτήν, κοιμηθῇ μετ' αὐτῆς, καὶ εὑρεθῇ, δώσει δ' ἄνθρω-
     πος ὁ κοιμηθεὶς μετ' αὐτῆς, τῷ πατρὶ τῆς νεάνιδος, πεντήκοντα
29 δίδραχμα ἀργυρίου, καὶ αὐτοῦ ἔσται γυνή, ἀφ' οὗ ἐταπείνωσεν
     αὐτήν· οὐ δυνήσεται ἐξαποστεῖλαι αὐτὴν τὸν ἅπαντα χρόνον αὐτοῦ.
30 Οὐ λήψεται ἄνθρωπος τὴν γυναῖκα τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἀνα-
     καλύψει συγκάλυμμα τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΓʹ. XXIII.

1 Οὐκ εἰσελεύσεται θλαδίας καὶ ἀποκεκομμένος εἰς οἶκον Κυρίου.
2 Οὐκ εἰσελεύσεται ἐκ πόρνης εἰς ἐκκλησίαν Κυρίου καὶ ἕως δεκά-
     της γενεᾶς οὐκ εἰσελεύσεται εἰς ἐκκλησίαν Κυρίου.
3 Οὐκ εἰσελεύ-
     σεται Ἀμμανίτης καὶ Μωαβίτης εἰς ἐκκλησίαν Κυρίου καὶ ἕως
     δεκάτης γενεᾶς οὐκ εἰσελεύσεται εἰς ἐκκλησίαν Κυρίου, καὶ ἕως

## English Translation

**DEUTERONOMY. CHAPTER 22.**

21 If virginity be not found in the young woman, then shall they bring forth the young woman unto the doors of her father's house. And the men of her city shall stone her with stones, and she shall die, because she wrought folly in Israel, by playing the harlot in her father's house.
22 So shalt thou put away evil from among yourselves.

And if a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband, then shall ye put to death both of them together: the man who lay with the woman,
23 and the woman [herself]. So shalt thou put away evil from Israel.

24 If there be a young virgin betrothed unto a man, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her, then shall ye bring them both forth unto the gate of their city. And they shall be stoned with stones, and they shall die: the young woman, because she cried not out in the city; and the man, because he did humble his neighbour’s wife.
25 So shalt thou put away evil from among yourselves.

But if a man find the betrothed young woman in the field, and he force her, and lie with her, then ye shall put to death the man that lay with her alone.
26 And unto the young woman ye shall do nothing; there is in the young woman no sin worthy of death. For as when a man riseth against his neighbour and slayeth his soul,
27 even so is this matter: for he found her in the field, and the betrothed young woman cried out, and there was no one to help her.

28 And if a man find a young virgin who is not betrothed, and he force her and lie with her, and it be found out, then the man who lay with her shall give unto the father of the young woman fifty didrachmas of silver.
29 And she shall be his wife, because he did humble her; he may not send her away all his days.
30 A man shall not take his father's wife, nor shall he uncover his father's covering.

**CHAPTER 23.**

1 He that is crushed in the testicles, or hath his member cut off, shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord.
2 One born of a prostitute shall not enter into the assembly of the Lord; and even unto the tenth generation shall he not enter into the assembly of the Lord.
3 An Ammonite and a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly of the Lord; and even unto the tenth generation shall he not enter into the assembly of the Lord, and even until
