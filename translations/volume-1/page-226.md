τῆς λιθοβολήσουσιν αὐτὸν ἐν λίθοις. Καὶ ἐγὼ ἐπιστήσω τὸ πρό- 3
σωπόν μου ἐπὶ τὸν ἄνθρωπον ἐκεῖνον, καὶ ἀπολῶ αὐτὸν ἐκ τοῦ
λαοῦ αὐτοῦ, ὅτι τοῦ σπέρματος αὐτοῦ ἔδωκεν ἄρχοντι, ἵνα μιά-
νῃ τὰ ἅγιά μου, καὶ βεβηλώσῃ τὸ ὄνομα τῶν ἡγιασμένων μοι.
Ἐὰν δὲ ὑπερόψει ὑπερίδωσιν οἱ αὐτόχθονες τῆς γῆς τοῖς ὀφθαλ- 4
μοῖς αὐτῶν ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ἐκείνου, ἐν τῷ δοῦναι αὐτὸν τοῦ
σπέρματος αὐτοῦ ἄρχοντι, τοῦ μὴ ἀποκτεῖναι αὐτὸν καὶ ἐπιστήσω 5
τὸ πρόσωπόν μου ἐπὶ τὸν ἄνθρωπον ἐκεῖνον καὶ τὴν συγγένειαν
αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀπολῶ αὐτὸν καὶ πάντας τοὺς ὁμονοοῦντας αὐτῷ, ὥστε
ἐκπορνεύειν αὐτὸν εἰς τοὺς ἄρχοντας, ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτῶν. Καὶ 6
ψυχὴ ἢ ἣν ἐπακολουθήσῃ ἐγγαστριμύθοις ἢ ἐπαοιδοῖς, ὥστε ἐκ-
πορνεῦσαι ὀπίσω αὐτῶν, ἐπιστήσω τὸ πρόσωπόν μου ἐπὶ τὴν ψυ-
χὴν ἐκείνην, καὶ ἀπολῶ αὐτὴν ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτῆς. Καὶ ἁγια- 7
σθήσεσθε, καὶ ἔσεσθε ἅγιοι, ὅτι ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν ἅγιός
εἰμι. Καὶ φυλάξεσθε τὰ προστάγματά μου, καὶ ποιήσετε αὐτά· ἐγὼ 8
Κύριος (ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν) ὁ ἁγιάζων ὑμᾶς. Ἄνθρωπος ἄνθρωπος ὃς 9
εἴπῃ κακῶς τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ ἢ τὴν μητέρα αὐτοῦ, θανάτῳ θανατοῦ-
σθω· πατέρα αὐτοῦ ἢ μητέρα αὐτοῦ κακῶς εἶπεν, ἔνοχος ἔσται. Καὶ 10
ἄνθρωπος ὃς ἂν μοιχεύσηται γυναῖκα ἀνδρός, ἢ ὃς ἂν μοιχεύ-
σηται γυναῖκα τοῦ πλησίον αὐτοῦ, θανάτῳ θανατούσθωσαν, ὁ μοι-
χεύων καὶ ἡ μοιχευομένη. Καὶ ἐάν τις κοιμηθῇ μετὰ γυναικὸς 11
τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ, ἀσχημοσύνην τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ ἀπεκάλυψε, θα-
νάτῳ θανατούσθωσαν ἀμφότεροι, ἔνοχοί εἰσι. Καὶ ἐάν τις κοιμηθῇ 12
μετὰ νύμφης αὐτοῦ, θανάτῳ θανατούσθωσαν ἀμφότεροι· ἠσέβησαν
(γάρ), ἔνοχοί εἰσι. Καὶ ὃς ἂν κοιμηθῇ μετὰ ἄρσενος κοίτην γυ- 13
ναικός, βδέλυγμα ἐποίησαν ἀμφότεροι· θανάτῳ θανατούσθωσαν, ἔ-
νοχοί εἰσιν. Ὃς ἂν λάβῃ γυναῖκα καὶ τὴν μητέρα αὐτῆς, ἀνό- 14
μημά ἐστιν· ἐν πυρὶ κατακαύσουσιν αὐτὸν καὶ αὐτάς, καὶ οὐκ
ἔσται ἀνόμημα ἐν ὑμῖν. Καὶ ὃς ἂν δῷ κοιτασίαν αὐτοῦ ἐν τετράπο- 15
δι, θανάτῳ θανατούσθω, καὶ τὸ τετράπουν ἀποκτενεῖτε. Καὶ γυνὴ ἥτις 16
προσελεύσεται πρὸς πᾶν κτῆνος βιβασθῆναι αὐτὴ ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ
ἀποκτενεῖτε τὴν γυναῖκα καὶ τὸ κτῆνος· θανάτῳ θανατούσθωσαν,
ἔνοχοί εἰσιν· ὃς ἂν λάβῃ τὴν ἀδελφὴν αὐτοῦ ἐκ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ ἢ 17
ἐκ μητρὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἴδῃ τὴν ἀσχημοσύνην αὐτῆς, καὶ αὕτη ἴδῃ
τὴν ἀσχημοσύνην αὐτοῦ, ὄνειδός ἐστιν, ἐξολοθρευθήσονται ἐνώπιον
υἱῶν γένους αὐτῶν· ἀσχημοσύνην ἀδελφῆς αὐτοῦ ἀπεκάλυψεν, ἁμαρτίαν

**LEVITICUS, CHAPTER 20**

3 And I shall set My face against that man, and I shall cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto [the] ruler, that he might defile My holy [things], and profane the name of those consecrated unto Me.

4 But if the natives of the land shall overlook, [yea], shall utterly overlook, [turning] their eyes from that man, in his giving of his seed unto [the] ruler, and fail to put him to death;

5 Then shall I set My face against that man and his kindred, and I shall cut off both him and all them that agree with him, so that he might go whoring after the rulers, from among their people.

6 And the soul, which shall follow after them that have familiar spirits, or after sorcerers, so as to go whoring after them, I shall set My face against that soul, and shall cut her off from among her people.

7 And ye shall be sanctified, and ye shall be holy; for I, the Lord your God, am holy.

8 And ye shall keep My statutes, and perform them; I am the Lord (your God) who sanctifieth you.

9 A man, a man, whosoever shall curse his father or his mother, he shall surely be put to death; he hath cursed his father or his mother, [and] he shall be guilty.

10 And a man, whosoever shall commit adultery with a man’s wife, or whosoever shall commit adultery with the wife of his neighbor, they shall surely be put to death, both the adulterer and the adulteress.

11 And if any man lie with his father’s wife, he hath uncovered his father’s nakedness; they both shall surely be put to death; they are guilty.

12 And if any man lie with his daughter-in-law, they both shall surely be put to death; for they have committed impiety; they are guilty.

13 And whosoever shall lie with a male, [as with] the lying of a woman, they both have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; they are guilty.

14 Whosoever shall take a woman and her mother, it is an iniquity; they shall burn him and them with fire, and there shall be no iniquity among you.

15 And whosoever shall give his cohabitation unto a four-footed [beast], he shall surely be put to death; and ye shall slay the four-footed [beast].

16 And a woman, which shall approach unto any beast to be mounted by it, ye shall slay the woman and the beast; they shall surely be put to death; they are guilty.

17 Whosoever shall take his sister, the daughter of his father, or the daughter of his mother, and shall see her nakedness, and she also shall see his nakedness, it is a reproach; they shall be utterly destroyed before the sons of their kin; he hath uncovered the nakedness of his sister; [it is] sin.
