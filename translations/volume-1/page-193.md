¶ 178 ΛΕΥΙΤΙΚΟΝ ΚΕΦ. Δ'. Ε'.
πᾶν αὐτοῦ τὸ αἷμα ἐκχεεῖ παρὰ τὴν βάσιν τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου τῆς
35 ὁλοκαυτώσεως. Καὶ πᾶν αὐτοῦ τὸ στέαρ περιελεῖ, ὃν τρόπον περιαιρεῖται στέαρ προβάτου ἐκ τῆς θυσίας τοῦ σωτηρίου· καὶ ἐπιθήσει αὐτὸ ὁ ἱερεὺς ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον ἐπὶ τὸ ὁλοκαύτωμα Κυρίου· καὶ ἐξιλάσεται περὶ αὐτοῦ ὁ ἱερεὺς περὶ τῆς ἁμαρτίας αὐτοῦ, ἧς ἥμαρτε, καὶ ἀφεθήσεται αὐτῷ.

ΚΕΦ. Ε'. V.

1 ΕΑΝ δὲ ψυχὴ ἁμάρτῃ, καὶ ἀκούσῃ φωνὴν ὁρκισμοῦ, καὶ οὗτος μάρτυς ἢ ἑώρακεν, ἢ σύνοιδεν, ἐὰν μὴ ἀπαγγείλῃ, καὶ λήψεται τὴν ἁμαρτίαν αὐτοῦ.
2 Ἡ ψυχή, ἥτις ἐὰν ἅψηται παντὸς πράγματος ἀκαθάρτου, ἢ θνησιμαίου (ἢ) θηριαλώτου ἀκαθάρτου, ἢ τῶν θνησιμαίων (ἢ) τῶν βδελυγμάτων τῶν ἀκαθάρτων, ἢ τῶν θνησιμαίων κτηνῶν τῶν ἀκαθάρτων, καὶ λάθῃ ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ
3 αὐτὸς μεμίανται, καὶ πλημμελήσῃ· ἢ ἅψηται ἀπὸ ἀκαθαρσίας ἀνθρώπου, ἀπὸ πάσης ἀκαθαρσίας αὐτοῦ, ἧς ἂν ἁψάμενος μιανθῇ,
4 καὶ ἔλαβεν αὐτόν, μετὰ τοῦτο δὲ γνῷ, καὶ πλημμελήσῃ· ἢ ψυχή, ἣ ἂν ὁμόσῃ, διαστέλλουσα τοῖς χείλεσι κακοποιήσαι ἢ καλῶς ποιῆσαι, κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἐὰν διαστείλῃ ὁ ἄνθρωπος μεθ᾿ ὅρκου, καὶ λάθῃ αὐτόν (πρὸ ὀφθαλμῶν), καὶ οὗτος γνῷ, καὶ ἁμάρτῃ ἔν τι
5 τούτων· καὶ ἔσται ὅτι πλημμελήσῃ εἷς ἓν ἀπὸ τούτων, καὶ ἐξαγορεύσει τὴν ἁμαρτίαν, περὶ ἧς ἡμάρτηκε κατ᾿ αὐτῆς, καὶ οἴσει
6 περὶ ὧν ἐπλημμέλησε Κυρίῳ, περὶ τῆς ἁμαρτίας αὐτοῦ, ἧς ἥμαρτε, θῆλυ ἀπὸ τῶν προβάτων ἀμνάδα, ἢ χίμαιραν ἐξ αἰγῶν, περὶ ἁμαρτίας· καὶ ἐξιλάσεται περὶ αὐτοῦ ὁ ἱερεὺς περὶ τῆς ἁμαρτίας αὐτοῦ, (ἧς ἥμαρτε,) καὶ ἀφεθήσεται αὐτῷ ἡ ἁμαρτία. Ἐὰν
7 δὲ μὴ ἰσχύῃ ἡ χεὶρ αὐτοῦ τὸ ἱκανὸν εἰς πρόβατον, οἴσει περὶ τῆς ἁμαρτίας αὐτοῦ, ἧς ἥμαρτε, δύο τρυγόνας, ἢ δύο νεοσσοὺς περιστερῶν τῷ Κυρίῳ, ἕνα περὶ ἁμαρτίας, καὶ ἕνα εἰς ὁλοκαύτωμα·
8 καὶ οἴσει αὐτὰ πρὸς τὸν ἱερέα· καὶ προσάξει ὁ ἱερεὺς τὸ περὶ ἁμαρτίας πρότερον, καὶ ἀποκνίσει ὁ ἱερεὺς τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ
9 τοῦ σφονδύλου αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐ διελεῖ· καὶ φανεῖ ἀπὸ τοῦ αἵματος τοῦ περὶ τῆς ἁμαρτίας ἐπὶ τὸν τοῖχον τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου, τὸ δὲ
10 κατάλοιπον τοῦ αἵματος καταστραγγιεῖ ἐπὶ τὴν βάσιν τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου· ἁμαρτίας γάρ ἐστι. Καὶ τὸ δεύτερον ποιήσει ὁλοκαύτωμα,

**LEVITICUS, CHAPTERS 4 & 5**

He shall pour out all its blood beside the base of the altar of the burnt offering. And all its fat shall he remove, even as the fat of a sheep is removed from the sacrifice of the peace offering; and the priest shall place it upon the altar, upon the burnt offering unto the Lord. And the priest shall make atonement for him concerning his sin which he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.

**CHAPTER 5**

1 If, moreover, a soul shall sin, and hear the voice of an adjuration, being a witness, whether he hath seen or hath known, yet if he declare it not, then he shall bear his sin.
2 Or if a soul shall touch any unclean thing; either an unclean dead carcass (or) [the carcass] of a beast torn by [other beasts], or of unclean dead things (or) of abominations, or of unclean dead cattle; and it escape his notice,
3 and he himself thereby be defiled, and trespass; or if he touch the uncleanness of a man, from any of his uncleanness by which he is made defiled;
4 and it hath come upon him; but after this he knoweth [it], and shall trespass; or if a soul shall swear, speaking with [its] lips to do evil, or to do good, according to all things whatsoever a man shall speak with an oath, and it escape him (though it be before his eyes); and this one shall know [it], and shall sin in any one of these things;
5 And it shall be, that if anyone trespass in one of these things, he shall confess the sin concerning which he hath sinned against it;
6 And he shall bring concerning that wherein he hath trespassed unto the Lord, concerning his sin which he hath sinned, a female from the sheep, a lamb, or a she-goat from the goats, for a sin offering. And the priest shall make atonement for him concerning his sin (which he hath sinned), and his sin shall be forgiven him.
7 If, however, his hand be not strong enough for a sheep, then he shall bring for his sin which he hath sinned, two turtledoves or two young pigeons unto the Lord; one for a sin offering, and one for a burnt offering.
8 And he shall bring them unto the priest; and the priest shall offer the one for the sin offering first, and shall pinch off its head from its neck, yet not divide it.
9 And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering upon the wall of the altar; and the remainder of the blood shall he drain out upon the base of the altar, for it is a sin offering.
10 And the second [bird] shall he make a burnt offering,
