ΚΕΦ. ΚΖ΄. ΚΗ΄. ΕΞΟΔΟΣ 145
καὶ λαβέτωσάν σοι ἔλαιον ἐξ ἐλαίων ἀτρύγητον καθαρὸν κεκομμένον εἰς φῶς, ἵνα καίηται λύχνος διαπαντός. Ἐν τῇ σκηνῇ τοῦ 21
μαρτυρίου, ἔξωθεν τοῦ καταπετάσματος τοῦ ἐπὶ τῆς διαθήκης, καύσει αὐτὸ Ἀαρὼν καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ ἀφ᾿ ἑσπέρας ἕως πρωΐ, ἔναντι Κυρίου· νόμιμον αἰώνιον εἰς τὰς γενεὰς ὑμῶν παρὰ τῶν
υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΗ΄. XXVIII.

ΚΑΙ σὺ προσαγάγου πρὸς σεαυτὸν τόν τε Ἀαρὼν τὸν ἀδελφόν 1
σου, καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ ἐκ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, ἱερατεύειν
μοι, Ἀαρών, καὶ Ναδάβ, καὶ Ἀβιούδ, καὶ Ἐλεάζαρ, καὶ Ἰθάμαρ, τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἀαρών. Καὶ ποιήσεις στολὴν ἁγίαν Ἀαρὼν τῷ 2
ἀδελφῷ σου εἰς τιμὴν καὶ δόξαν. Καὶ σὺ λάλησον πᾶσι τοῖς σοφοῖς 3
τῇ διανοίᾳ, οὓς ἐνέπλησα πνεύματος αἰσθήσεως· καὶ ποιήσουσι τὴν στολὴν τὴν ἁγίαν Ἀαρὼν εἰς τὸ ἅγιον, ἐν ᾗ ἱερατεύσει μοι. Καὶ αὗται αἱ στολαί, ἃς ποιήσουσι· τὸ περιστήθιον, καὶ 4
τὴν ἐπωμίδα, καὶ τὸν ποδήρη, καὶ χιτῶνα κοσυμβωτόν, καὶ χίδαρίν, καὶ ζώνην· καὶ ποιήσουσι στολὰς ἁγίας Ἀαρὼν καὶ τοῖς
υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸ ἱερατεύειν μοι. Καὶ αὐτοὶ λήψονται τὸ χρυσίον, 5
καὶ τὴν ὑάκινθον, καὶ τὴν πορφύραν, καὶ τὸ κόκκινον, καὶ
τὴν βύσσον· καὶ ποιήσουσι τὴν ἐπωμίδα ἐκ χρυσίου, καὶ ὑακίνθου, 6
καὶ πορφύρας, καὶ κοκκίνου νενησμένου, καὶ ἐκ βύσσου κεχλωσμένης, ἔργον ὑφαντὸν ποικιλτοῦ. Δύο ἐπωμίδες ἔσονται αὐτῷ 7
συνέχουσαι (αὐτῷ) ἑτέρα τὴν ἑτέραν, ἐπὶ τοῖς δυσὶ μέρεσιν
ἐξηρτημέναι. Καὶ τὸ ὕφασμα τῶν ἐπωμίδων ὃ ἔστιν ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ, 8
κατὰ τὴν ποίησιν ἐξ αὐτοῦ ἔσται ἐκ χρυσίου, καὶ ὑακίνθου, καὶ
πορφύρας, καὶ κοκκίνου διανενησμένου, καὶ βύσσου κεχλωσμένης.
Καὶ λήψῃ τοὺς δύο λίθους, λίθους σμαράγδου, καὶ γλύψεις ἐπ᾿ 9
αὐτοῖς τὰ ὀνόματα τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ· ἕξ ὀνόματα ἐπὶ τὸν λίθον 10
τὸν ἕνα, καὶ τὰ ἕξ ὀνόματα τὰ λοιπὰ ἐπὶ τὸν λίθον τὸν δεύτερον κατὰ τὰς γενέσεις αὐτῶν. Ἔργον λιθουργικῆς τέχνης, γλύμμα 11
σφραγῖδος διαγλύψεις τοὺς δύο λίθους (διαγλύψεις) ἐπὶ τοῖς
ὀνόμασι τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ· περικεκλωσμένους καὶ συνεφραγισμένους χρυσίῳ ποιήσεις αὐτούς. Καὶ θήσεις τοὺς δύο λίθους ἐπὶ τῶν 12
ὤμων τῆς ἐπωμίδος· (λίθοι μνημοσύνου εἰσὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ.)

**EXODUS. Chapter 27.**

21 And they shall bring unto thee pure oil from olives, unpressed and beaten for the light, that a lamp may burn continually. In the Tabernacle of Testimony, without the veil which is upon the ark of the covenant, Aaron and his sons shall burn it from evening until morning, before the Lord; [it is] a perpetual statute for your generations from the sons of Israel.

**Chapter 28.**

1 And thou, bring near unto thyself Aaron thy brother, and his sons from among the sons of Israel, to minister as priests unto Me; [even] Aaron, and Nadab, and Abihu, and Eleazar, and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron.
2 And thou shalt make holy garments for Aaron thy brother, for honor and for glory.
3 And thou shalt speak unto all that are wise of heart, whom I have filled with the spirit of understanding; and they shall make the holy garments for Aaron, for the sanctuary, wherein he shall minister as priest unto Me.
4 And these are the garments which they shall make: the breastplate, and the ephod, and the robe, and a broidered coat, and a turban, and a girdle; and they shall make holy garments for Aaron and for his sons, that they may minister as priests unto Me.
5 And they shall take the gold, and the blue, and the purple, and the scarlet, and the fine linen;
6 And they shall make the ephod of gold, and of blue, and of purple, and of spun scarlet, and of twined fine linen, [even] the work of a skillful weaver.
7 Two shoulder pieces shall be for it, holding (to it) the one to the other, [which shall be] fastened upon its two sides.
8 And the woven band of the ephod, which is upon it, according to its making thereof, shall be of gold, and of blue, and of purple, and of thoroughly spun scarlet, and of twined fine linen.
9 And thou shalt take two stones, stones of emerald, and engrave upon them the names of the sons of Israel:
10 Six names upon the one stone, and the six remaining names upon the second stone, according to their generations.
11 [It shall be] the work of a stone engraver, the engraving of a seal, shalt thou engrave the two stones (shalt thou engrave) with the names of the sons of Israel; thou shalt make them encircled and sealed with gold.
12 And thou shalt put the two stones upon the shoulders of the ephod; (they are stones of memorial for the sons of Israel.)
