ΚΕΦ. ΜΒ΄. ΜΓ΄. ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ 79
λησεν ὁ ἄνθρωπος ὁ κύριος τῆς γῆς πρὸς ἡμᾶς σκληρά, καὶ ἔθετο ἡμᾶς ἐν φυλακῇ, ὡς κατασκοπεύοντας τὴν γῆν. Εἴπαμεν δὲ αὐ- 31
τῷ· εἰρηνικοί ἐσμεν, οὐκ ἐσμὲν κατάσκοποι· δώδεκα ἀδελφοί ἐσμεν, 32
υἱοὶ τοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν· ὁ εἷς οὐχ ὑπάρχει, ὁ δὲ μικρότερος μετὰ
τοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν σήμερον εἰς γῆν Χαναάν. Εἶπε δὲ ἡμῖν ὁ ἄν- 33
θρωπος ὁ κύριος τῆς γῆς· ἐν τούτῳ γνωσόμεθα, ὅτι εἰρηνικοί ἐστε·
ἀδελφὸν ὑμῶν ἕνα ἄφετε ὧδε μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ, τὸν δὲ ἀγορασμὸν τῆς
σιτοδοσίας ὑμῶν λαβόντες, ἀπελθατε· καὶ ἀγάγετε πρός με τὸν 34
ἀδελφὸν ὑμῶν τὸν νεώτερον, καὶ γνώσομαι ὅτι οὐ κατάσκοποι ἐστε,
ἀλλ᾿ ὅτι εἰρηνικοί ἐστε· καὶ τὸν ἀδελφὸν ὑμῶν ἀποδώσω ὑμῖν, καὶ
τῇ γῇ ἐμπορεύσεσθε. Ἐγένετο δὲ ἐν τῷ κατακενοῦν αὐτοὺς τοὺς 35
σάκκους αὐτῶν, καὶ ἦν ἑκάστου ὁ δεσμὸς τοῦ ἀργυρίου αὐτοῦ ἐν
τῷ σάκκῳ αὐτῶν· καὶ ἴδον τοὺς δεσμοὺς τοῦ ἀργυρίου αὐτῶν
αὐτοί, καὶ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν. Εἶπε δὲ αὐτοῖς Ἰα- 36
κὼβ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτῶν· ἐμὲ ἠτεκνώσατε. Ἰωσὴφ οὐκ ἔστι, Συμεὼν
οὐκ ἔστι, καὶ τὸν Βενιαμὶν λήψεσθε ; ἐπ᾿ ἐμὲ ἐγένετο πάντα ταῦ-
τα. Εἶπε δὲ Ῥουβὴν τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ, λέγων· τοὺς δύο υἱούς μου 37
ἀπόκτεινον, ἐὰν μὴ ἀγάγω αὐτὸν πρός σε· δὸς αὐτὸν εἰς τὴν χεῖ-
ρά μου, κἀγὼ ἀνάξω αὐτὸν πρός σε. Ὁ δὲ εἶπεν· οὐ καταβήσε- 38
ται ὁ υἱός μου μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν, ὅτι ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ ἀπέθανε, καὶ αὐ-
τὸς μόνος καταλέλειπται· καὶ συμβήσεται αὐτὸν μαλακισθῆναι ἐν
τῇ ὁδῷ, ᾗ ἂν πορεύησθε, καὶ καταξάτετέ μου τὸ γῆρας μετὰ λύπης
εἰς ᾅδου. Ὁ δὲ λιμὸς ἐνίσχυσεν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς..

ΚΕΦ. ΜΓ΄. XLIII.

ἙΓΕΝΕΤΟ δὲ ἡνίκα συνετέλεσαν καταφαγεῖν τὸν σῖτον, ὅν 1
ἤνεγκαν ἐξ Αἰγύπτου, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς ὁ πατὴρ αὐτῶν πάλιν
πορευθέντες, πρίασθε ἡμῖν μικρὰ βρώματα. Εἶπε δὲ αὐτῷ Ἰού- 2
δας, λέγων· διαμαρτυρίᾳ διαμεμαρτύρηται ἡμῖν ὁ ἄνθρωπος, λέ-
γων· οὐκ ὄψεσθε τὸ πρόσωπόν μου, ἐὰν μὴ ὁ ἀδελφὸς ὑμῶν ὁ
νεώτερος καταβῇ πρὸς με. Εἰ μὲν οὖν ἀποστέλλεις τὸν ἀδελφὸν 3
ἡμῶν μεθ᾿ ἡμῶν, καταβησόμεθα, καὶ ἀγοράσομέν σοι βρώματα·
εἰ δὲ μὴ ἀποστέλλεις τὸν ἀδελφὸν ἡμῶν μεθ᾿ ἡμῶν, οὐ πορευ- 4
σόμεθα· ὁ γὰρ ἄνθρωπος εἶπεν ἡμῖν, λέγων· οὐκ ὄψεσθέ μου τὸ
πρόσωπον, ἐὰν μὴ ὁ ἀδελφὸς ὑμῶν ὁ νεώτερος μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν ᾖ. Εἶπε 5

### Genesis Chapter 42

**30** The man, the lord of the land, spake hard things unto us, and put us in ward, as though we were spies of the land.
**31** And we said unto him, We be peaceful men; we are no spies;
**32** we are twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.
**33** And the man, the lord of the land, said unto us, Hereby shall we know that ye are peaceful men:
**34** Leave one of your brethren here with me, and take ye the purchase of your grain, and depart; and bring unto me your younger brother, and I shall know that ye are no spies, but that ye are peaceful men; and I will restore your brother unto you, and ye shall trade in the land.

**35** And it came to pass, as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man’s bundle of silver was in his sack; and they saw their bundles of silver, both they and their father, and they were afraid.
**36** And Jacob their father said unto them, Ye have bereaved me [of my children]: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and will ye take Benjamin? All these things are come upon me.
**37** And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee; give him into mine hand, and I will bring him again to thee.
**38** And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he alone is left; and it shall come to pass that he be harmed upon the way wherein ye go, and ye shall bring down my old age with sorrow to Hades. Now the famine was sore in the land.

### Genesis Chapter 43

**1** Now it came to pass, when they had finished eating the grain which they had brought out of Egypt, that their father said unto them again, Go again, buy us a little food.
**2** And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your younger brother be with you.
**3** If therefore thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food;
**4** but if thou wilt not send our brother with us, we will not go down:
**5** for the man said unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, unless your younger brother be with you.
