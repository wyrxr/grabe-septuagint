8 τοὺς ἐν χειρὶ ἀλλοφύλων, καὶ ἐν χειρὶ υἱῶν Ἀμμὼν. Καὶ ἐσά-
θρωσαν καὶ ἔθλασαν τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τῷ ἐνιαυτῷ ἐκείνῳ
ὀκτωκαίδεκα ἔτη, πάντας τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ τοὺς ἐν τῷ πέραν
9 τοῦ Ἰορδάνου, ἐν τῇ γῇ τοῦ Ἀμορραίου ἐν τῇ Γαλααδίτιδι. Καὶ
διέβησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἀμμὼν τὸν Ἰορδάνην, τοῦ ἐκπολεμῆσαι καὶ ἐν
τῷ Ἰούδα καὶ Βενιαμὶν, καὶ ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ Ἐφραΐμ· καὶ ἐθλίβη-
10 σαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ σφόδρα. Καὶ ἐβόησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς Κύ-
ριον, λέγοντες· ἡμάρτομέν σοι, ὅτι ἐγκατελίπομεν τὸν (Κύριον) Θεὸν
11 ἡμῶν, καὶ ἐλατρεύσαμεν ταῖς Βααλείμ. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς
τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραήλ· οὐχὶ Αἰγύπτιοι, καὶ Ἀμορραῖοι, καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ
12 Ἀμμὼν, καὶ Μωάβ, καὶ οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι, καὶ Σιδώνιοι, καὶ Μαδι-
ὰμ, καὶ Ἀμαλὴκ ἐξέθλιψαν ὑμᾶς; καὶ ἐπεκράξατε πρός με, καὶ
13 ἔσωσα ὑμᾶς ἐκ χειρὸς αὐτῶν. Καὶ ὑμεῖς ἐγκατελίπετέ με, καὶ
ἐλατρεύσατε θεοῖς ἑτέροις· διὰ τοῦτο οὐ προσθήσω τοῦ σῶσαι
14 ὑμᾶς. Βαδίζετε, καὶ βοᾶτε πρὸς τοὺς θεοὺς οὓς ἐξελέξασθε ἑαυ-
τοῖς, καὶ αὐτοὶ σωσάτωσαν ὑμᾶς ἐν καιρῷ θλίψεως ὑμῶν. Καὶ
15 εἶπαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς Κύριον· ἡμάρτομεν, ποίησον σὺ ἡμῖν
κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἂν ἀρέσκῃ ἐνώπιόν σου· πλὴν Κύριε ἐξελοῦ ἡ-
16 μᾶς ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ταύτῃ. Καὶ μετέστησαν τοὺς θεοὺς τοὺς ἀλλο-
τρίους ἐκ μέσου αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐλάτρευσαν τῷ Κυρίῳ, καὶ οὐκ εὐ-
ηρέστησεν ἐν τῷ λαῷ, καὶ ὠλιγοψύχησεν ἐν τῷ κόπῳ Ἰσραήλ.
17 Καὶ ἀνέβησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἀμμὼν, καὶ παρενέβαλον ἐν Γαλαάδ· καὶ
ἐξῆλθον οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ παρενέβαλον ἐν τῇ Μασσηφά. Καὶ
18 εἶπον οἱ ἄρχοντες τοῦ λαοῦ Γαλαὰδ, ἀνὴρ πρὸς τὸν πλησίον αὐ-
τοῦ· τίς ἀνὴρ ὃς ἄρξεται πολεμῆσαι ἐν τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἀμμὼν, καὶ
ἔσται εἰς κεφαλὴν πᾶσι τοῖς κατοικοῦσι Γαλαάδ;

ἔτεκεν ἡ γυνὴ Γαλαὰδ αὐτῷ δύο υἱούς· καὶ ἠδρύθησαν οἱ υἱοὶ
τῆς γυναικὸς, καὶ ἐξέβαλον τὸν Ἰεφθάε, καὶ εἶπον αὐτῷ· οὐ κλη-

### Judges Chapter 10

**8.** —into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the sons of Ammon. And they wore down and oppressed the children of Israel in that year, [even for] eighteen years, all the children of Israel who were beyond

**9.** the Jordan, in the land of the Amorite, in Gilead. And the children of Ammon passed over the Jordan to wage war even in Judah and Benjamin, and in the house of Ephraim; and the children of Israel were greatly distressed.

**10.** And the children of Israel cried unto the Lord, saying, "We have sinned against thee, for we have forsaken our [Lord] God, and we have served the Baalim."

**11.** And the Lord said unto the children of Israel, "Did not the Egyptians, and the Amorites, and the children of Ammon,

**12.** and Moab, and the Philistines, and the Sidonians, and Midian, and Amalek oppress you? And ye cried unto Me, and I saved you from their hand.

**13.** Yet ye have forsaken Me, and served other gods; wherefore I will no more save you.

**14.** Go, and cry unto the gods whom ye have chosen for yourselves, and let them save you in the time of your tribulation."

**15.** And the children of Israel said unto the Lord, "We have sinned: do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good in thy sight; nevertheless, O Lord, deliver us in this day."

**16.** And they put away the foreign gods from among them, and served the Lord; and He found no delight in the affliction of His people, and His soul was grieved for the toil of Israel.

**17.** And the children of Ammon came up, and encamped in Gilead; and the children of Israel went forth, and encamped in Mizpeh.

**18.** And the leaders of the people of Gilead said, each man unto his neighbor, "Who is the man that shall begin to fight against the children of Ammon, and shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead?"

### Judges Chapter 11

**1.** Now Jephthah the Gileadite was mighty in strength; and he

**2.** was the son of a harlot woman, and she bore Jephthah unto Gilead. And the wife of Gilead bore him two sons; and the sons of the wife grew up, and they cast out Jephthah, and said unto him, "Thou shalt not inherit in the house of our father, for thou art the son of another woman."

**3.** And Jephthah fled from the face of his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob; and there gathered themselves unto [Jephthah]—
