στηρίου, τά τε ὁλοκαυτώματα, καὶ τὰ στέατα· καὶ εἶδε πᾶς ὁ
λαὸς, καὶ ἐξέστη, καὶ ἔπεσαν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον αὐτῶν.

ΚΕΦ. Ι΄. Χ.

1 ΚΑΙ λαβόντες οἱ υἱοὶ Ἀαρών, Ναδὰβ καὶ Ἀβιούδ, ἕκαστος
τὸ πυρεῖον αὐτοῦ, ἔθηκαν ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸ πῦρ, καὶ ἐπέβαλον ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸ
θυμιάματα, καὶ προσήνεγκαν ἔναντι Κυρίου πῦρ ἀλλότριον, ὃ οὐ
2 προσέταξε Κύριος αὐτοῖς. Καὶ ἐξῆλθε πῦρ παρὰ Κυρίου, καὶ κατέφαγεν
αὐτοὺς, καὶ ἀπέθανον ἔναντι Κυρίου. 3 Καὶ εἶπε Μωυσῆς
πρὸς Ἀαρών· τοῦτό ἐστιν, ὃ εἶπε Κύριος, λέγων· ἐν τοῖς ἐγγίζουσί
μοι ἁγιασθήσομαι, καὶ ἐν πάσῃ τῇ συναγωγῇ δοξασθήσομαι·
4 καὶ κατενύχθη Ἀαρών. Καὶ ἐκάλεσε Μωυσῆς τὸν Μισαδαΐ, καὶ
τὸν Ἐλισαφάν, υἱοὺς Ὀζιὴλ, υἱοὺς τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ τοῦ πατρὸς Ἀαρὼν,
καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· προσέλθατε καὶ ἄρατε τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς ὑμῶν
5 ἐκ προσώπου τῶν ἁγίων ἔξω τῆς παρεμβολῆς. Καὶ προσῆλθον,
καὶ ἦραν αὐτοὺς ἐν τοῖς χιτῶσιν αὐτῶν ἔξω τῆς παρεμβολῆς, ὃν
6 τρόπον εἶπε Μωυσῆς. Καὶ εἶπε Μωυσῆς πρὸς Ἀαρὼν καὶ Ἐλεάζαρ
καὶ Ἰθάμαρ, τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ τοὺς καταλελειμμένους· τὴν
κεφαλὴν ὑμῶν οὐκ ἀποκιδαρώσετε, καὶ τὰ ἱμάτια ὑμῶν οὐ διαρρήξετε,
ἵνα μὴ ἀποθάνητε, καὶ ἐπὶ πᾶσαν τὴν συναγωγὴν ἔσται
θυμός, οἱ δὲ ἀδελφοὶ ὑμῶν, πᾶς οἶκος Ἰσραὴλ, κλαύσονται τὸν
7 ἐμπυρισμὸν, ὃν ἐνεπυρίσθησαν ὑπὸ Κυρίου. Καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς θύρας τῆς
σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου οὐκ ἐξελεύσεσθε, ἵνα μὴ ἀποθάνητε· τὸ γὰρ
ἔλαιον τῆς χρίσεως, τὸ παρὰ Κυρίου, ἐφ᾽ ὑμῖν. Καὶ ἐποίησαν
8 κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα Μωυσῆ. Καὶ ἐλάλησε Κύριος τῷ Ἀαρών, λέγων·
9 οἶνον καὶ σίκερα οὐ πίεσθε σὺ καὶ οἱ υἱοί σου μετὰ σοῦ, ἡνίκα
ἂν εἰσπορεύησθε εἰς τὴν σκηνὴν τοῦ μαρτυρίου, ἢ προσπορευομένων
ὑμῶν πρὸς τὸ θυσιαστήριον, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἀποθάνητε· νόμιμον
10 αἰώνιον εἰς τὰς γενεὰς ὑμῶν· καὶ διαστεῖλαι ἀναμέσον τῶν ἁγίων
11 καὶ τῶν βεβήλων, καὶ ἀναμέσον τῶν ἀκαθάρτων καὶ τῶν καθαρῶν,
καὶ συμβιβάζειν τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ πάντα τὰ νόμιμα, ἃ ἐλάλησε
Κύριος πρὸς αὐτοὺς διὰ χειρὸς Μωυσῆ. 12 Καὶ εἶπε Μωυσῆς πρὸς
Ἀαρὼν καὶ πρὸς Ἐλεάζαρ καὶ Ἰθάμαρ, τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἀαρὼν τοὺς
καταλειφθέντας· λάβετε τὴν θυσίαν τὴν καταλειφθεῖσαν ἀπὸ τῶν
καρπωμάτων Κυρίου, καὶ φάγεσθε αὐτὴν ἄζυμα παρὰ τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου·

188 LEVITICUS

...the altar, both the burnt offerings and the fat. And all the people beheld it, and were struck with awe, and fell upon their faces.

CHAPTER 10

1 Now Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, each took his censer, and put fire therein, and laid incense upon it, and offered strange fire before the Lord, which He had not commanded them. 2 And there came forth fire from the Lord, and consumed them, and they died before the Lord. 3 Then Moses said unto Aaron, "This is that which the Lord spake, saying, 'In them that draw nigh unto Me will I be sanctified, and before all the congregation will I be glorified.'" And Aaron was silent, being deeply grieved.

4 And Moses called Misadaï and Elisaphan, the sons of Uzziel, the sons of the brother of Aaron's father, and said unto them, "Draw nigh, and bear your brethren away from before the holy place, outside the camp." 5 So they drew nigh, and bore them forth in their tunics outside the camp, as Moses had spoken.

6 And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and Ithamar, his sons who remained, "Ye shall not uncover your heads, nor shall ye rend your garments, lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the congregation. But your brethren, even all the house of Israel, shall lament the burning which the Lord hath kindled." 7 And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of testimony, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the Lord is upon you." And they did according to the word of Moses.

8 And the Lord spake unto Aaron, saying, 9 "Drink not wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye enter into the tabernacle of testimony, or when ye draw near unto the altar, that ye die not. This shall be a perpetual ordinance throughout your generations; 10 and that ye may discern between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean; 11 and that ye may instruct the sons of Israel in all the statutes which the Lord hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses."

12 And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron who remained, saying, "Take ye the sacrifice that remaineth of the Lord's oblations, and eat it unleavened beside the altar;
