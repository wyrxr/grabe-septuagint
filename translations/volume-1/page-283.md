**ΑΡΙΘΜΟΙ**
**ΚΕΦ. ΙΗ΄. XVIII.**

1 ΚΑΙ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς ᾿Ααρών, λέγων· σὺ καὶ οἱ υἱοί σου, καὶ ὁ οἶκος τοῦ πατρός σου μετὰ σοῦ λήψεσθε τὰς ἁμαρτίας τῶν ἁγίων· καὶ σὺ καὶ οἱ υἱοί σου μετὰ σοῦ, λήψεσθε τὰς ἁμαρτίας τῆς
2 ἱερατείας ὑμῶν. Καὶ τοὺς ἀδελφούς σου, φυλὴν Λευί, δῆμον τοῦ πατρός σου προσάγαγου πρὸς σεαυτόν, καὶ προστεθήτωσάν σοι, καὶ λειτουργείτωσάν σοι, καὶ σὺ καὶ οἱ υἱοί σου μετὰ σοῦ ἀπέναντι
3 τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου. Καὶ φυλάξονται τὰς φυλακὰς σου, καὶ τὰς φυλακὰς τῆς σκηνῆς (σου)· πλὴν πρὸς τὰ σκεύη τὰ ἅγια καὶ πρὸς τὸ θυσιαστήριον οὐ προσελεύσονται, καὶ οὐκ ἀποθανοῦνται
4 καὶ οὗτοι καὶ ὑμεῖς. Καὶ προστεθήσονται πρὸς σέ, καὶ φυλάξονται τὰς φυλακὰς τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου, κατὰ πάσας τὰς λειτουργίας τῆς σκηνῆς· καὶ ὁ ἀλλογενὴς οὐ προσελεύσεται
5 πρὸς σέ· καὶ φυλάξετε τὰς φυλακὰς τῶν ἁγίων, καὶ τὰς φυλακὰς τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ἔτι θυμὸς ἐν τοῖς υἱοῖς ᾿Ισραήλ.
6 Καὶ ἐγὼ εἴληφα τοὺς ἀδελφούς ὑμῶν τοὺς Λευίτας ἐκ μέσου τῶν υἱῶν ᾿Ισραὴλ δόμα δεδομένον Κυρίῳ, λειτουργεῖν τὰς λειτουργίας τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου.
7 Καὶ σὺ καὶ οἱ υἱοί σου μετὰ σοῦ διατηρήσετε τὴν ἱερατείαν ὑμῶν κατὰ πάντα τρόπον τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου, καὶ τὸ ἔνδοθεν τοῦ καταπετάσματος, καὶ λειτουργήσετε τὰς λειτουργίας, δόμα τῆς ἱερατείας ὑμῶν· καὶ ὁ ἀλλογενὴς ὁ προσπορευόμενος ἀποθανεῖται.
8 Καὶ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς ᾿Ααρὼν [λέγων]· καὶ ἐγὼ ἰδοὺ δέδωκα ὑμῖν τὴν διατήρησιν τῶν ἀπαρχῶν μου ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν ἡγιασμένων μοι παρὰ τῶν υἱῶν ᾿Ισραήλ· σοὶ δέδωκα αὐτὰ εἰς γέρας, καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς σου μετὰ σέ νόμιμον αἰώνιον.
9 Καὶ τοῦτο ἔστω ὑμῖν ἀπὸ τῶν ἡγιασμένων ἁγίων, τῶν καρπωμάτων, ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν δώρων αὐτῶν, καὶ ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν θυσιασμάτων αὐτῶν, καὶ ἀπὸ πάσης τῆς πλημμελείας αὐτῶν, καὶ ἀπὸ πασῶν τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν αὐτῶν, ὅσα ἀποδιδόασί μοι, ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν ἁγίων, σοὶ ἔσται καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς σου·
10 ἐν τῷ ἁγίῳ τῶν ἁγίων φάγεσθε αὐτά· πᾶν ἀρσενικὸν φάγεται αὐτά. σὺ καὶ οἱ υἱοί σου ἅγια ἔσται σοι.
11 Καὶ τοῦτο ἔσται ὑμῖν ἀπαρχῶν δομάτων αὐτῶν, ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν ἐπιθεμάτων τῶν υἱῶν ᾿Ισραήλ· σοὶ δέδωκα αὐτά, καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς σου, καὶ ταῖς θυγατράσι σου μετὰ σοῦ,

**CHAPTER 18**

1 And the Lord spake unto Aaron, saying, | Thou and thy sons, and the house of thy father with thee, | shall bear the iniquity of the holy things; | and thou and thy sons with thee, | shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.
2 And thy brethren also, the tribe of Levi, | the people of thy father's house, | do thou bring near unto thyself; | and let them be joined unto thee, | and let them minister unto thee; | and thou and thy sons with thee | shall be before the tabernacle of testimony.
3 And they shall keep thy charge, | and the charge of the tabernacle (thine); | but unto the holy vessels and unto the altar | they shall not draw nigh, | lest they die, both these [Levites] and ye [priests].
4 And they shall be joined unto thee, | and shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony, | concerning all the services of the tabernacle; | and a stranger shall not draw near unto thee.
5 And ye shall keep the charge of the holy things, | and the charge of the altar; | and there shall be no more wrath | among the children of Israel.
6 For I, behold, have taken your brethren the Levites | from among the children of Israel; | [they are] a gift given unto the Lord, | to perform the service of the tabernacle of testimony.
7 Therefore thou and thy sons with thee | shall keep your priesthood in every manner | concerning the altar, | and that which is within the veil; | and ye shall perform the services, | [for it is] a gift of your priesthood. | And any stranger who draweth near shall die.
8 And the Lord spake unto Aaron, [saying], | "Behold, I have given unto you | the keeping of My firstfruits | from all the things sanctified unto Me | by the children of Israel. | Unto thee have I given them for a special portion, | and to thy sons after thee, | a perpetual ordinance."
9 "And this shall be yours | from the most holy things, | from the burnt offerings, | from all their gifts, | and from all their sacrifices, | and from all their trespass offerings, | and from all their sin offerings, | whatsoever they render unto Me | from all the holy things: | it shall be thine and thy sons'."
10 "In the most holy place shall ye eat them; | every male shall eat them. | For thee and thy sons, holy [shall it be] unto thee."
11 "And this shall be yours | from the firstfruit gifts of them, | from all the heave offerings of the children of Israel: | unto thee have I given them, | and to thy sons, and to thy daughters with thee."
