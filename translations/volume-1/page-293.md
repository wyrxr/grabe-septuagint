28 τὴν ὄνον ἐν τῇ ῥάβδῳ. Καὶ ἤνοιξεν ὁ Θεὸς τὸ στόμα τῆς ὄνου, καὶ
εἶπε τῷ Βαλαὰμ· τί πεποίηκά σοι, ὅτι πέπαικάς με τοῦτο τρίτον;
30 Καὶ εἶπε Βαλαὰμ τῇ ὄνῳ· ὅτι ἐμπέπαιχάς μοι· καὶ εἰ ἔσχον μάχαιραν
ἐν τῇ χειρί μου, ἤδη ἂν ἐξεκέντησά σε. Καὶ λέγει ἡ ὄνος τῷ Βαλαάμ·
οὐκ ἐγὼ ἡ ὄνος σου, ἐφ᾽ ἧς ἐπέβαινες ἐκ νεότητός σου ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας
ταύτης; μὴ ὑπεροράσει ὑπεριδοῦσα ἐποίησά σοι οὕτως; ὁ δὲ εἶπεν· οὐχί.
31 Ἀπεκάλυψε δὲ ὁ Θεὸς τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς τοῦ Βαλαάμ, καὶ ὀξᾷ τὸν ἄγγελον
τοῦ Θεοῦ ἀνθεστηκότα ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ, καὶ τὴν μάχαιραν αὐτοῦ ἐσπασμένην
ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ· καὶ κύψας προσεκύνησε τῷ προσώπῳ αὐτοῦ.
32 Καὶ λέγει αὐτῷ ὁ ἄγγελος τοῦ Θεοῦ· διατί ἐπάταξας τὴν ὄνον σου
τοῦτο τρίτον; καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐξῆλθον εἰς διαβολήν σου, ὅτι οὐκ ἀστεία
33 ἡ ὁδός σου ἐναντίον μου· καὶ ἰδοῦσά με ἡ ὄνος, ἐξέκλινεν ἀπ᾽ ἐμοῦ
τοῦτο τρίτον· καὶ εἰ μὴ ἐξέκλινεν ἀπ᾽ ἐμοῦ, νῦν σὲ μὲν ἀπέκτεινα,
ἐκείνην δ᾽ ἂν περιεποιησάμην.
34 Καὶ εἶπε Βαλαὰμ τῷ ἀγγέλῳ Κυρίου· ἡμάρτηκα· οὐ γὰρ ἠπιστάμην,
ὅτι σὺ (μοι) ἀνθέστηκας εἰς συνάντησίν μοι ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ· καὶ νῦν εἰ μή σοι
ἀρέσκει, 35 ἀποστραφήσομαι.
Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ ἄγγελος τοῦ Θεοῦ πρὸς Βαλαὰμ· συμπορεύθητι μετὰ τῶν
ἀνθρώπων· πλὴν τὸ ῥῆμα ὃ ἐὰν εἴπω πρὸς σέ, τοῦτο φυλάξῃ λαλῆσαι.
Καὶ ἐπορεύθη Βαλαὰμ μετὰ τῶν ἀρχόντων Βαλάκ.
36 Καὶ ἀκούσας Βαλάκ, ὅτι ἥκει Βαλαάμ, ἐξῆλθεν εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτῷ,
εἰς πόλιν Μωάβ, ἥ ἐστιν ἐπὶ τῶν ὁρίων 37 Ἀρνῶν, ἥ ἐστιν ἐκ μέρους
τῶν ὁρίων·
Καὶ εἶπε Βαλάκ πρὸς Βαλαάμ· οὐχὶ ἀποστείλας ἀπέστειλα πρὸς σέ,
καλέσαι σε; διατί οὐκ ἤρχου πρὸς μέ; 38 ὄντως οὐ δυνήσομαι τιμῆσαί σε;
Καὶ εἶπε Βαλαὰμ πρὸς Βαλάκ· ἰδοὺ ἥκω πρὸς σὲ νῦν· δυνατὸς ἔσομαι
λαλῆσαι τί; τὸ ῥῆμα ὃ ἐὰν ἐμβάλῃ ὁ Θεὸς εἰς τὸ στόμα μου, τοῦτο
φυλάξω λαλῆσαι.
39 Καὶ ἐπορεύθη Βαλαὰμ μετὰ Βαλάκ, καὶ ἦλθον 40 εἰς πόλεις ἐπαύλεων.
Καὶ ἔθυσε Βαλάκ πρόβατα καὶ μόσχους, 41 καὶ ἀπέστειλε τῷ Βαλαὰμ
καὶ τοῖς ἄρχουσι τοῖς μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ.
Καὶ ἐγενήθη πρωΐ· καὶ παραλαβὼν Βαλάκ τὸν Βαλαάμ, ἀνεβίβασεν αὐτὸν
ἐπὶ τὴν στήλην τοῦ Βαάλ, καὶ ἔδειξεν αὐτῷ ἐκεῖθεν μέρος τε τοῦ λαοῦ.

**Numbers 22**

28 the ass with the rod.

And God opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam: "What have I done to you, that you have smitten me this third time?"

30 And Balaam said unto the ass: "Because you have made a fool of me! And if I had a sword in my hand, surely I would have pierced you through by now."

And the ass said unto Balaam: "Am I not your own ass, upon whom you have ridden from your youth until this very day? Did I, with such disdain and utter disregard, ever do this to you?"

And he said, "No."

31 Then God uncovered the eyes of Balaam, and he keenly beheld the angel of God standing against him on the road, and his sword drawn in his hand. And Balaam bowed low and worshipped before his face.

32 And the angel of God said unto him: "Why have you struck your ass this third time? And behold, I came forth to be an adversary unto you, for your way is not seemly before me.

33 And the ass, seeing me, turned aside from me this third time. And if she had not turned aside from me, I would now have slain you, but her I would have preserved [alive]."

34 And Balaam said unto the angel of the Lord: "I have sinned; for I did not know that you [indeed] stood in opposition to me upon the road to meet me. And now, if it pleases you not, I will turn back."

35 And the angel of God said unto Balaam: "Go forth with the men; nevertheless, the word which I shall speak unto you, that same word shall you take heed to speak."

So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.

36 And when Balak heard that Balaam had come, he went forth to meet him, unto a city of Moab, which lies upon the borders of

37 Arnon, and which is a part of the borders.

And Balak said unto Balaam: "Did I not earnestly send unto you, to summon you? Why did you not come unto me? Truly, shall I not be able to honor you?"

38 And Balaam said unto Balak: "Behold, I am come unto you now. What might I be able to speak? The word which God shall put into my mouth, that will I take heed to speak."

39 And Balaam went with Balak, and they came

40 unto cities of homesteads. And Balak sacrificed sheep and calves,

41 and sent [portions] unto Balaam and to the princes who were with him.

And it came to pass in the morning, that Balak took Balaam and brought him up to the high place of Baal, and from there he showed him a part of the people.
