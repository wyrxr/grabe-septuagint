γωγῆς· καὶ ἀφελεῖτε τὸ τέλος Κυρίῳ παρὰ τῶν ἀνθρώπων τῶν πολεμιστῶν τῶν ἐκπορευομένων εἰς τὴν παράταξιν, μίαν ψυχὴν ἀπὸ πεντακοσίων, ἀπὸ τῶν ἀνθρώπων, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν κτηνῶν, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν βοῶν, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν προβάτων, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ὄνων· καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἡμίσους αὐτῶν λήψεσθε, καὶ δώσεις Ἐλεάζαρ τῷ ἱερεῖ τὰς ἀπαρχὰς Κυρίου. Καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἡμίσους τοῦ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ λήψῃ ἕνα τὸν κρατούμενον ἀπὸ τῶν πεντήκοντα, ἀπὸ τῶν ἀνθρώπων, (καὶ) ἀπὸ τῶν βοῶν, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν προβάτων, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ὄνων, καὶ ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν κτηνῶν, καὶ δώσεις αὐτὰ τοῖς Λευΐταις, τοῖς φυλάσσουσι τὰς φυλακὰς ἐν τῇ σκηνῇ Κυρίου. Καὶ ἐποίησε Μωυσῆς καὶ Ἐλεάζαρ ὁ ἱερεὺς, καθὰ συνέταξε Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ. Καὶ ἐγενήθη τὰ σκῦλα, τὸ πλεόνασμα τῆς προνομῆς ὃ ἐπρονόμευσαν οἱ ἄνδρες οἱ πολεμισταὶ, ἀπὸ τῶν προβάτων, ἑξακόσιαι χιλιάδες καὶ ἑβδομήκοντα χιλιάδες καὶ πεντακισχίλια· καὶ βοῶν, δύο καὶ ἑβδομήκοντα χιλιάδες· καὶ ὄνων, μία καὶ ἑξήκοντα χιλιάδες· καὶ ψυχαὶ ἀνθρώπων ἀπὸ τῶν γυναικῶν αἳ οὐκ ἔγνωσαν κοίτην ἀνδρὸς, πᾶσα ψυχὴ, δύο καὶ τριάκοντα χιλιάδες. Καὶ ἐγενήθη τὸ ἡμίσευμα ἡ μερὶς τῶν ἐκπορευομένων εἰς τὸν πόλεμον, ἐκ τοῦ ἀριθμοῦ τῶν προβάτων, τριακόσιαι χιλιάδες καὶ τριάκοντα χιλιάδες καὶ ἑπτακισχίλια καὶ πεντακόσια, καὶ ἐγένετο τὸ τέλος Κυρίῳ ἀπὸ τῶν προβάτων ἑξακόσιαι ἑβδομήκοντα πέντε· καὶ βόες, ἓξ καὶ τριάκοντα χιλιάδες, καὶ τὸ τέλος αὐτῶν τῷ Κυρίῳ, δύο καὶ ἑβδομήκοντα· καὶ ὄνοι, τριάκοντα χιλιάδες καὶ πεντακόσιοι, καὶ τὸ τέλος αὐτῶν τῷ Κυρίῳ, εἷς καὶ ἑξήκοντα· καὶ ψυχαὶ ἀνθρώπων, ἓξ καὶ δέκα χιλιάδες, καὶ τὸ τέλος αὐτῶν Κυρίῳ δύο καὶ τριάκοντα ψυχαί. Καὶ ἔδωκε Μωυσῆς τὸ τέλος (Κυρίῳ), τὸ ἀφαίρεμα τοῦ Θεοῦ Ἐλεάζαρ τῷ ἱερεῖ, καθάπερ συνέταξε Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ. Ἀπὸ τοῦ ἡμισεύματος τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ, οὓς διεῖλε Μωυσῆς ἀπὸ τῶν ἀνδρῶν τῶν πολεμιστῶν, (Καὶ ἐγένετο τὸ ἡμίσευμα τὸ τῆς συναγωγῆς ἀπὸ τῶν προβάτων, τριακόσιαι χιλιάδες καὶ τριάκοντα χιλιάδες καὶ ἑπτακισχίλια καὶ πεντακόσια· καὶ βόες, ἓξ καὶ τριάκοντα χιλιάδες· καὶ ὄνοι, τριάκοντα χιλιάδες καὶ πεντακόσιοι· καὶ ψυχαὶ ἀνθρώπων, ἓξ καὶ δέκα χιλιάδες.) καὶ ἔλαβε Μωυσῆς ἀπὸ τοῦ ἡμισεύματος τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ κρατούμενον ἓν ἀπὸ τῶν πεντήκοντα, ἀπὸ τῶν ἀνθρώπων καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν κτηνῶν, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὰ τοῖς Λευΐταις, τοῖς φυλάσσουσι τὰς φυλακὰς τῆς σκηνῆς

**30** And from the half part of the children of Israel, thou shalt take one prisoner from fifty, from the men, (and) from the oxen, and from the sheep, and from the asses, and from all the cattle, and thou shalt give them unto the Levites, who keep the charges in the Tabernacle of the Lord.

**44** thousand and seven thousand and five hundred; and oxen, thirty-six thousand;
**45** and asses, thirty thousand and five hundred;
**46** and human souls, sixteen thousand.) And Moses took
