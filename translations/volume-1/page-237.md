222 ΛΕΥΙΤΙΚΟΝ ΚΕΦ· ΚΕ·
32 Καὶ αἱ πόλεις τῶν Λευιτῶν, οἰκίαι τῶν πόλεων αὐτῶν κατασχέ-
33 σεως, λυτρωταὶ διαπαντὸς ἔσονται τοῖς Λευίταις· καὶ ὃς ἂν λυ-
   τρωσάμενος παρὰ τῶν Λευιτῶν, καὶ ἐξελεύσεται ἡ διάπρασις (αὐ-
   τῶν) οἰκιῶν πόλεως κατασχέσεως αὐτῶν ἐν τῇ ἀφέσει, ὅτι οἰ-
   κίαι τῶν πόλεων τῶν Λευιτῶν αὕτη ἡ κατάσχεσις αὐτῶν ἐν μέσῳ
34 υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ οἱ ἀγροὶ ἀφωρισμένοι ταῖς πόλεσιν αὐτῶν οὐ
35 πραθήσονται, ἔτι κατάσχεσις αἰωνία τοῦτο αὐτῶν ἐστιν. Ἐὰν δὲ
   πένεται ὁ ἀδελφός σου, καὶ ἀδυνατήσῃ ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτοῦ παρὰ
   σοί, ἀντιλήψῃ αὐτοῦ ὡς προσηλύτου καὶ παροίκου, καὶ ζήσεται ὁ
36 ἀδελφός σου μετὰ σοῦ. Οὐ λήψῃ παρ᾿ αὐτοῦ τόκον, οὐδὲ ἐπὶ πλή-
   θει, καὶ φοβηθήσῃ τὸν Θεόν σου· ἐγὼ Κύριος· καὶ ζήσεται ὁ ἀ-
37 δελφός σου μετὰ σοῦ. Τὸ ἀργύριόν σου οὐ δώσεις αὐτῷ ἐπὶ τό-
   κῳ, καὶ ἐπὶ πλεονασμῷ οὐ δώσεις αὐτῷ τὰ βρώματά σου. Ἐγὼ
38 Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν, ὁ ἐξαγαγὼν ὑμᾶς ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, δοῦ-
39 ναι ὑμῖν τὴν γῆν Χαναάν, ὥστε εἶναι ὑμῶν Θεός. Ἐὰν δὲ ταπει-
   νωθῇ ὁ ἀδελφός σου παρὰ σοί, καὶ πραθῇ σοι οὐ δουλεύσει σοι δου-
40 λείαν οἰκέτου· ὡς ὁ μισθωτὸς ἢ πάροικος ἔσται σοι, ἕως τοῦ ἔτους
   τῆς ἀφέσεως ἐργάται παρὰ σοί· καὶ ἐξελεύσεται τῇ ἀφέσει, καὶ
41 τὰ τέκνα αὐτοῦ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀπελεύσεται εἰς τὴν γενεὰν ἑαυ-
42 τοῦ, εἰς τὴν κατάσχεσιν τὴν πατρικὴν αὐτοῦ ἀποδραμεῖται. Διότι
   οἰκέται μου εἰσὶν οὗτοι, οὓς ἐξήγαγον ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, οὐ πρα-
43 θήσεται ἐν πράσει οἰκέτου· οὐ κατατενεῖς αὐτὸν ἐν τῷ μόχθῳ,
44 καὶ φοβηθήσῃ (Κύριον) τὸν Θεόν σου. Καὶ παῖς σου καὶ παιδίσκη
   σου, ὅσοι ἂν γένωνταί σοι ἀπὸ τῶν ἐθνῶν, ὅσοι κύκλῳ σου εἰσίν,
45 ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν κτήσεσθε δοῦλον καὶ δούλην· καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν τῶν
   παροίκων τῶν ὄντων ἐν ὑμῖν, ἀπὸ τούτων κτήσεσθε, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν
   συγγενῶν αὐτῶν, ὅσοι ἂν γένωνται ἐν τῇ γῇ ὑμῶν, ἔστωσαν ὑμῖν
46 εἰς κατάσχεσιν. Καὶ καταμεριεῖτε αὐτοὺς τοῖς τέκνοις ὑμῶν μεθ᾿
   ὑμᾶς, καὶ ἔσονται ὑμῖν κατόχιμοι, εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα αὐτοὺς κατα-
   δουλώσεσθε· τῶν δὲ ἀδελφῶν ὑμῶν τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, ἕκαστος
47 τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ οὐ κατατενεῖ ἐν τοῖς μόχθοις. Ἐὰν δὲ εὕρῃ ἡ
   χεὶρ τοῦ προσηλύτου ἢ τοῦ παροίκου τοῦ παρὰ σοί, καὶ ἀπορηθεὶς
   ὁ ἀδελφός σου μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, πραθῇ τῷ προσηλύτῳ ἢ τῷ παροίκῳ
48 τῷ παρὰ σοί, ἢ ἐκ γενετῆς προσηλύτῳ, μετὰ τὸ πραθῆναι αὐτῷ,
49 λύτρωσις ἔσται αὐτῷ, εἷς τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτοῦ λυτρώσεται αὐτόν.
   Ἀδελφὸς πατρὸς αὐτοῦ, ἢ υἱὸς ἀδελφοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ λυτρώσεται

**A Literary Translation:**

**Leviticus Chapter 25**

**32** As for the cities of the Levites, [even] the houses of their cities [shall be for their] possession, redeemable shall they be perpetually unto the Levites.
**33** And if any man shall redeem [a house] from among the Levites, then shall the sale (of their) houses of their city of possession revert in the year of Release; for the houses of the cities of the Levites, this [is] their possession in the midst of the sons of Israel.
**34** Moreover, the fields, which are assigned unto their cities, shall not be sold; for this [is] their eternal possession.

**35** If thy brother become poor, and his hand fail him with thee, then shalt thou support him as a stranger and a sojourner, that thy brother may live with thee.
**36** Thou shalt not take of him usury, nor any excessive gain; but thou shalt fear thy God: I am the LORD; and thy brother shall live with thee.
**37** Thy money shalt thou not lend to him upon usury, nor give him thy victuals for increase.
**38** I am the LORD your God, who brought you forth from the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, that I might be your God.

**39** And if thy brother be humbled with thee, and be sold unto thee, he shall not serve thee as a household slave.
**40** As a hired servant, or as a sojourner, shall he be with thee; until the year of Release shall laborers be with thee; and he shall go forth at the Release, and
**41** his children with him; and he shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he depart.
**42** For they are My servants, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt; he shall not be sold with the sale of a household slave.
**43** Thou shalt not rule over him with rigor, nor oppress him with hard labor, but shalt fear [the Lord] thy God.

**44** And thy male servant and thy female servant, all those who shall come to be for thee from the nations, all those who are round about thee,
**45** from them shall ye acquire a male slave and a female slave. And from the children of the sojourners who dwell among you, from these shall ye acquire; and from their families, all those who shall be born in your land, they shall be unto you for a possession.
**46** And ye shall apportion them unto your children after you, and they shall be unto you as possessions held; forever shall ye enslave them. But over your brethren, the children of Israel, each one shall not rule over his brother with hard labor.

**47** If the hand of a stranger or a sojourner with thee become wealthy, and thy brother become impoverished with him, and be sold unto the stranger or sojourner that is with thee, or unto a proselyte by birth,
**48** after he is sold unto him, a redemption shall be for him; one of his brethren shall redeem him.
**49** His father's brother, or his father's brother's son shall redeem him.
