ΚΕΦ. ςʹ. ΙΗΣΟΥΣ ΝΑΥΗ 385
τὴν γῆν, εἶπεν Ἰησοῦς· εἰσέλθατε εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν τῆς γυναι-
κὸς τῆς πόρνης, καὶ ἐξαγάγετε αὐτὴν ἐκεῖθεν, καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐστὶν
(ἐν) αὐτῇ, καθὼς ὠμόσατε αὐτῇ. Καὶ εἰσῆλθον οἱ δύο νεανίσκοι 22
οἱ κατασκοπεύσαντες τὴν πόλιν εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν τῆς γυναικός, καὶ
ἐξήγαγον τὴν Ῥαὰβ τὴν πόρνην, καὶ τὸν πατέρα αὐτῆς, καὶ τὴν
μητέρα αὐτῆς, καὶ τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτῆς, καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἦν αὐτῇ,
καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν συγγένειαν αὐτῆς· καὶ κατέστησαν αὐτὴν ἔξω τῆς
παρεμβολῆς Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἡ πόλις ἐνεπυρίσθη ἐν πυρὶ σὺν πᾶσι 23
τοῖς ἐν αὐτῇ· πλὴν ἀργυρίου καὶ χρυσίου καὶ παντὸς χαλκοῦ καὶ
σιδήρου ἔδωκαν εἰς θησαυρὸν Κυρίου εἰσενεχθῆναι. Καὶ Ῥαὰβ τὴν 24
πόρνην, καὶ πάντα τὸν οἶκον τὸν πατρικὸν αὐτῆς, καὶ πάντα τὰ
αὐτῆς, ἐζώγρησεν Ἰησοῦς, καὶ κατῴκησεν ἐν τῷ Ἰσραὴλ ἕως τῆς
σήμερον ἡμέρας, διότι ἔκρυψε τοὺς κατασκοπεύσαντας, οὓς ἀπέ-
στειλεν Ἰησοῦς κατασκοπεῦσαι τὴν Ἱεριχώ. Καὶ ὤρκισεν Ἰησοῦς 25
ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ λέγων· ἐπικατάρατος ὁ ἄνθρωπος ἐναντίον
Κυρίου, ὃς ἀναστήσει καὶ οἰκοδομήσει τὴν πόλιν ἐκείνην τὴν
Ἱεριχώ· ἐν τῷ πρωτοτόκῳ αὐτοῦ θεμελιώσει αὐτήν, καὶ ἐν τῷ
ἐλαχίστῳ αὐτοῦ ἐπιστήσει τὰς πύλας αὐτῆς. Καὶ οὕτως ἐποίησεν
ὁ Ἀζὰν ὁ ἐκ Βαιθήλ· ἐν τῷ Ἀβειρὼν τῷ πρωτοτόκῳ ἐθεμελί-
ωσεν αὐτήν, καὶ ἐν τῷ διασωθέντι ἐλαχίστῳ ἐπέστησε πύλας αὐ-
τῆς. Καὶ ἦν Κύριος μετὰ Ἰησοῦ, καὶ ἦν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ κατὰ 26
πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν.

ΚΕΦ. Ζʹ. VII.

ΚΑΙ ἐπλημμέλησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ πλημμέλεια, καὶ ἐνοσφί- 1
σαντο ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀναθέματος· καὶ ἔλαβεν Ἄχαν υἱὸς Χαρμὶ υἱοῦ
Ζαβρὶ υἱοῦ Ζαρὰ ἐκ τῆς φυλῆς Ἰούδα ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀναθέματος. Καὶ
ἐθυμώθη ὀργῇ Κύριος τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ἰησοῦς 2
ἄνδρας εἰς Γαΐ, ἥ ἐστι κατὰ Βηθαῦν, κατὰ ἀνατολὰς Βαι-
θήλ, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς, λέγων· κατασκευάσθε τὴν γῆν· καὶ ἀνέ-
βησαν οἱ ἄνδρες, καὶ κατεσκεύαντο τὴν (γῆν) Γαΐ. Καὶ ἀνέστρεψαν 3
πρὸς Ἰησοῦν, καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς αὐτόν· μὴ ἀναβαινέτω πᾶς ὁ λαός,
ἀλλ’ ὡς δισχίλιοι ἄνδρες ἢ τρισχίλιοι ἄνδρες ἀναβήτωσαν, καὶ ἐμπολιορκησάτωσαν
τὴν πόλιν· μὴ ἀναγάγῃς ἐκεῖ τὸν λαὸν ἅπαντα,
ὀλίγοι γάρ εἰσι. Καὶ ἀνέβησαν ἀπὸ τοῦ λαοῦ ἐκεῖ ὡς τρισχίλιοι 4
                                                           25
ἄνδρες, καὶ ἔφυγον ἀπὸ προσώπου ἀνδρῶν Γαί. Καὶ ἀπέκτειναν 5
ἀπ’ αὐτῶν ἄνδρες Γαὶ εἰς τριάκοντα καὶ ἓξ ἄνδρας, καὶ κατεδίωξαν
αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ τῆς πύλης, ἕως συνέτριψαν αὐτούς, καὶ ἐπάταξαν
αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ τοῦ καταφεροῦς· καὶ ἐπτοήθη ἡ καρδία τοῦ
λαοῦ, καὶ ἐγένετο ὥσπερ ὕδωρ. Καὶ διέρρηξεν Ἰησοῦς τὰ ἱμάτια 6
αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔπεσεν Ἰησοῦς ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον ἔναντι κιβωτοῦ
Κυρίου ἕως ἑσπέρας, αὐτὸς καὶ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι Ἰσραήλ·
καὶ ἐπεβάλοντο χοῦν ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτῶν. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰησοῦς· 7
δέομαι Κύριε Κύριε, διατί διαβιβάζων διεβίβασεν ὁ παῖς σου τὸν
λαὸν τοῦτον τὸν Ἰορδάνην, παραδοῦναι αὐτὸν τῷ Ἀμοῤῥαίῳ, ἀπολέσαι
ἡμᾶς; καὶ εἰ κατεμείναμεν καὶ κατωκίσθημεν παρὰ τὸν Ἰορδάνην.
Ἐν ἐμοὶ Κύριε· (καὶ) τί ἐρῶ, ἐπεὶ μετέβαλεν Ἰσραὴλ αὐχένα 8
ἀπέναντι τοῦ ἐχθροῦ αὐτοῦ; καὶ ἀκούσας ὁ Χαναναῖος 9
καὶ πάντες οἱ κατοικοῦντες τὴν γῆν περικυκλώσουσιν ἡμᾶς, καὶ
ἐκτρίψουσιν ἡμᾶς ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς· καὶ τί ποιήσεις τὸ ὄνομά σου τὸ
μέγα; Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Ἰησοῦν· ἀνάστηθι, ἵνατί τοῦτο σὺ 10
πέπτωκας ἐπὶ πρόσωπόν σου; Ἡμάρτηκεν ὁ λαὸς καὶ παρέβη τὴν 11
διαθήκην μου, ἣν διεθέμην πρὸς αὐτούς· καῖγε ἔλαβον ἀπὸ τοῦ
ἀναθέματος, καὶ κλέψαντες ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀναθέματος, ἐψεύσαντο· καὶ
ἐνέβαλον εἰς τὰ σκεύη αὐτῶν. Καὶ οὐ μὴ δύνωνται οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ 12
ὑποστῆναι κατὰ πρόσωπον τῶν ἐχθρῶν αὐτῶν, αὐχένα ἐπιστρέψουσι
κατὰ πρόσωπον τῶν ἐχθρῶν αὐτῶν, ὅτι ἐγενήθησαν
ἀνάθεμα· οὐ προσθήσω ἔτι εἶναι μεθ’ ὑμῶν, ἐὰν μὴ ἐξάρητε τὸ
ἀνάθεμα ἐξ ὑμῶν αὐτῶν. Ἀναστὰς ἁγίασον τὸν λαόν, καὶ εἶπον 13
ἁγιασθῆναι εἰς αὔριον. Τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ· τὸ ἀνάθεμά
ἐστιν ἐν ὑμῖν, Ἰσραήλ· οὐ δυνήσεσθε ἀντιστῆναι ἀπέναντι
τῶν ἐχθρῶν ὑμῶν, ἕως ἂν ἐξάρητε τὸ ἀνάθεμα ἐξ ὑμῶν. Καὶ 14
συναχθήσεσθε πάντες τοπρωῒ κατὰ φυλάς, καὶ ἔσται ἡ φυλὴ ἣν
ἂν δείξῃ Κύριος, προσάξετε κατὰ δήμους· καὶ τὸν δῆμον ὃν ἂν
ἐνδείξῃ Κύριος, προσάξετε κατ’ οἴκους· καὶ τὸν οἶκον ὃν ἂν ἐνδείξῃ
Κύριος, προσάξετε κατ’ ἄνδρα. Καὶ ὃς ἂν ἐνδειχθῇ ἐν τῷ 15
ἀναθέματι, κατακαυθήσεται ἐν πυρί, αὐτὸς καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐστιν
αὐτῷ, ὅτι παρέβη τὴν διαθήκην Κυρίου, καὶ ὅτι ἐποίησεν ἀνόμημα
ἐν Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ὤρθρισεν Ἰησοῦς τοπρωί, καὶ προσήγαγε τὸν 16
λαὸν κατὰ φυλὰς αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐνεδείχθη ἡ φυλὴ Ἰούδα. Καὶ προσήχθη 17
κατὰ δήμους Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐνεδείχθη δῆμος ὁ Ζαριεί· καὶ προσ-

**Joshua 6**
21 the land, Joshua said unto them, "Go ye into the house of the woman, the harlot, and bring out
from thence both her and all that was (therein) with her, even as ye swore unto her."
22 And the two young men, who had spied out the city, went into the woman's house;
and they brought forth Rahab the harlot, and her father, and her mother,
and her brethren, and all that was hers, yea, all her kindred;
and they set her outside the camp of Israel.
23 And the city was burned with fire, with all that was therein;
save for the silver and the gold and all bronze and iron,
these were dedicated to be brought into the treasury of the Lord.
24 And Rahab the harlot, and all her father's house, and all that was hers,
Joshua preserved alive; and she dwelleth in Israel even unto this day,
because she hid the spies whom Joshua had sent to spy out Jericho.
25 And Joshua adjured them on that day, saying, "Cursed be the man before the Lord,
who shall rise up and build that city, even Jericho:
in his firstborn shall he lay its foundation, and in his youngest son shall he set up its gates."
And thus did Azan of Bethel: in Abiron, his firstborn, did he lay its foundation,
and in his youngest, even him who had been preserved alive, did he set up its gates.
26 And the Lord was with Joshua; and his name was renowned throughout all the land.

**Joshua 7**
1 But the sons of Israel committed a trespass,
and they purloined from the devoted thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi,
the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the devoted thing.
And the Lord was wroth with fierce anger against the sons of Israel.
2 And Joshua sent men unto Ai, which is toward Bethaun, east of Bethel;
and he said unto them, saying, "Go up and make a survey of the land."
And the men went up and surveyed Ai.
3 And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, "Let not all the people go up;
but let about two thousand men, or three thousand men, go up and besiege the city.
Bring not up all the people thither, for they are few [in number]."
4 And there went up of the people thither about three thousand men;
5 and they fled from the face of the men of Ai. And the men of Ai slew of them
about thirty and six men: and they pursued them from the gate
until they had utterly crushed them, and smote them on the descent.
And the heart of the people was dismayed, and became as water.
6 And Joshua rent his garments, and fell upon the earth upon his face
before the ark of the Lord until eventide, he and the elders of Israel;
7 and they put dust upon their heads. And Joshua said,
"Alas, O Lord, Lord, wherefore hast Thou at all brought over Thy servant,
this people, across the Jordan, to deliver them into the hand of the Amorite,
to destroy us? Would that we had remained and dwelt beyond the Jordan!
8 Alas, O Lord, [and] what shall I say, seeing that Israel hath turned their backs
before their enemy?
9 And when the Canaanite shall hear, and all the inhabitants of the land,
they shall encircle us, and utterly destroy us from the earth.
And what wilt Thou do for Thy great Name?"
10 And the Lord said unto Joshua, "Arise! Wherefore art thou thus fallen upon thy face?
11 The people have sinned, and have transgressed My covenant which I made with them.
Yea, they have taken of the devoted thing, and stealing from the devoted thing,
they have lied; and they have put it even among their own goods.
12 And therefore the sons of Israel shall not be able to stand before their enemies;
they shall turn their backs before their enemies, because they have become a devoted thing.
I will no longer be with you, unless ye take away the devoted thing from among yourselves.
13 Arise, sanctify the people, and command them to sanctify themselves for the morrow."
"Thus saith the Lord God of Israel: 'The devoted thing is among you, O Israel;
ye shall not be able to stand against your enemies, until ye take away the devoted thing from among you.
14 And ye shall be gathered all of you early in the morning by your tribes;
and it shall be, that the tribe which the Lord shall point out,
ye shall bring forth by families; and the family which the Lord shall point out,
ye shall bring forth by households; and the household which the Lord shall point out,
ye shall bring forth man by man.
15 And whosoever shall be found [to possess] the devoted thing,
he shall be utterly burned with fire, he and all that he hath,
because he transgressed the covenant of the Lord, and because he committed an iniquity in Israel.'"
16 So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought the people by their tribes;
17 and the tribe of Judah was pointed out. And he brought the families of Judah near,
and the family of Zariei was pointed out; and he brought
