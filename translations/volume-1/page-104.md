**14** σίτου οὐ ἠγόραζον, καὶ ἐσιτομέτρει αὐτοῖς· καὶ εἰσήνεγκεν Ἰωσὴφ πᾶν τὸ ἀργύριον εἰς τὸν οἶκον Φαραώ.
**15** Καὶ ἐξέλιπε τὸ ἀργύριον ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, καὶ ἐκ γῆς Χαναάν· ἦλθον δὲ πάντες οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι πρὸς Ἰωσήφ, λέγοντες· δὸς ἡμῖν ἄρτους, καὶ ἵνατὶ ἀποθνήσκομεν ἐναντίον σου; ἐκλέλοιπε γὰρ τὸ ἀργύριον (ἡμῶν).
**16** Εἶπε δὲ αὐτοῖς Ἰωσήφ· φέρετε τὰ κτήνη ὑμῶν, καὶ δώσω ὑμῖν ἄρτους ἀντὶ τῶν κτηνῶν ὑμῶν, εἰ ἐκλέλοιπε τὸ ἀργύριον (ὑμῶν).
**17** Ἤγαγον δὲ τὰ κτήνη αὐτῶν πρὸς Ἰωσήφ, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς Ἰωσὴφ ἄρτους ἀντὶ τῶν ἵππων, καὶ ἀντὶ τῶν προβάτων, καὶ ἀντὶ τῶν βοῶν, καὶ ἀντὶ τῶν ὄνων· καὶ ἐξέθρεψεν αὐτοὺς ἐν ἄρτοις ἀντὶ πάντων τῶν κτηνῶν αὐτῶν ἐν τῷ ἐνιαυτῷ ἐκείνῳ.
**18** Ἐξῆλθε δὲ τὸ ἔτος ἐκεῖνο, καὶ ἦλθον πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐν τῷ ἔτει τῷ δευτέρῳ, καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῷ· μὴ ποτε ἐκτριβῶμεν ἀπὸ τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν; εἰ γὰρ ἐκλέλοιπε τὸ ἀργύριον καὶ τὰ ὑπάρχοντα καὶ τὰ κτήνη πρὸς σε τὸν κύριον ἡμῶν, καὶ οὐχ ὑπολείπεται ἐναντίον τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν, ἀλλ᾿ ἢ τὸ ἴδιον σῶμα καὶ ἡ γῆ ἡμῶν.
**19** Ἵνα οὖν μὴ ἀποθάνωμεν ἐναντίον σου, καὶ ἡ γῆ ἐρημωθῇ, κτῆσαι ἡμᾶς καὶ τὴν γῆν ἡμῶν ἀντὶ ἄρτων, καὶ ἐσόμεθα ἡμεῖς καὶ ἡ γῆ ἡμῶν παῖδες τῷ Φαραώ· δὸς σπέρματα, ἵνα σπείρωμεν, καὶ ζήσωμεν, καὶ μὴ ἀποθάνωμεν, καὶ ἡ γῆ οὐχ ἐρημωθήσεται.
**20** Καὶ ἐκτήσατο Ἰωσὴφ πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν τῶν Αἰγυπτίων τῷ Φαραώ· ἀπέδοντο γὰρ οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν τῷ Φαραώ· ἐπεκράτησε γὰρ ὁ λιμὸς αὐτῶν· καὶ ἐγένετο ἡ γῆ τῷ Φαραώ.
**21** Καὶ τὸν λαὸν κατεδουλώσατο αὐτῶν εἰς παῖδας, ἀπ᾿ ἄκρων ὁρίων Αἰγύπτου καὶ ἕως τῶν ἄκρων.
**22** Χωρὶς τῆς γῆς τῶν ἱερέων μόνον οὐκ ἐκτήσατο Ἰωσήφ· ἐν δόσει γὰρ ἔδωκε δόματα τοῖς ἱερεῦσι Φαραώ, καὶ ἤσθιον τὴν δόσιν, ἣν ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς Φαραώ· διὰ τοῦτο οὐκ ἀπέδοντο τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν.
**23** Εἶπε δὲ Ἰωσὴφ πᾶσι τοῖς Αἰγυπτίοις· Ἰδοὺ κέκτημαι ὑμᾶς καὶ τὴν γῆν ὑμῶν σήμερον τῷ Φαραώ· λάβετε ἑαυτοῖς σπέρματα, καὶ σπείρατε τὴν γῆν.
**24** Καὶ ἔσται τὰ γενήματα αὐτῆς, καὶ δώσετε τὸ πέμπτον μέρος τῷ Φαραώ· τὰ δὲ τέσσαρα μέρη ἔσται ὑμῖν αὐτοῖς εἰς σπέρματα τῇ γῇ, καὶ εἰς βρῶσιν ὑμῖν, καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς ἐν τοῖς οἴκοις ὑμῶν.
**25** Καὶ εἶπαν· σέσωκας ἡμᾶς, εὕρομεν χάριν ἐναντίον τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν, καὶ ἐσόμεθα παῖδες τῷ Φαραώ.
**26** Καὶ ἔθετο αὐτοῖς Ἰωσὴφ εἰς πρόσταγμα ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης ἐπὶ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, ἀποπεμπτοῦν τῷ Φαραώ· χωρὶς τῆς γῆς τῶν ἱε-

### Genesis Chapter 47

**14** And when they had bought no [more] corn, he measured out [grain] unto them; and Joseph brought all the silver into the house of Pharaoh.
**15** And the silver was spent from the land of Egypt and from the land of Canaan. Then all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, saying, “Give us bread, for wherefore should we die before thee? For our money is spent.”
**16** And Joseph said unto them, “Bring forth your cattle, and I will give you bread in exchange for your cattle, if your money be spent.”
**17** And they brought their cattle unto Joseph; and Joseph gave them bread for horses, and for flocks, and for oxen, and for asses; and he nourished them with bread in exchange for all their cattle in that year.
**18** And when that year was ended, they came unto him in the second year, and said unto him, “Peradventure we should perish before our lord? For our money is spent, and our possessions and our cattle are with thee, our lord, and there is nothing left before our lord, save our own bodies and our land.
**19** Now therefore, lest we perish before thee, and the land become desolate, do thou acquire us and our land in exchange for bread; and we and our land shall be bondservants unto Pharaoh. Give [us] seed, that we may sow, and live, and not die, and that the land be not desolate.”
**20** And Joseph acquired all the land of the Egyptians for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his land unto Pharaoh, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh’s.
**21** And he made their people bondservants, from the uttermost bounds of Egypt even unto the uttermost [bounds].
**22** Only the land of the priests Joseph acquired not; for Pharaoh had given a provision unto the priests, and they did eat the allowance which Pharaoh gave them. Therefore they sold not their land.
**23** Then Joseph said unto all the Egyptians, “Behold, I have acquired you and your land this day for Pharaoh; take unto yourselves seed, and sow the land.
**24** And it shall be, when the harvest thereof cometh, that ye shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh; and the four parts shall be your own, for seed for the land, and for food for you, and for all those that are in your houses.”
**25** And they said, “Thou hast saved our lives; we have found favour in the sight of our lord, and we will be bondservants unto Pharaoh.”
**26** And Joseph made it a statute unto them, until this day, throughout the land of Egypt, to pay a fifth part unto Pharaoh; save only the land of the priests, which belonged not unto Pharaoh.
