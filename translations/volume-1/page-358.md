ΚΕΦ. ΙΗʹ. ΔΕΥΤΕΡΟΝΟΜΙΟΝ 343
νόματι Κυρίου, αὐτὸς καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας. Ἐὰν 6
δὲ παραγένηται ὁ Λευΐτης ἐκ μιᾶς τῶν πόλεων ὑμῶν ἐκ πάντων
τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, οὗ αὐτὸς παροικεῖ ἐκεῖ, καθότι ἐπιθυμεῖ ἡ ψυχὴ
αὐτοῦ, εἰς τὸν τόπον ὃν ἂν ἐκλέξηται Κύριος, καὶ λειτουργήσει 7
ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ αὐτοῦ, ὥσπερ πάντες οἱ
ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ οἱ Λευῖται, οἱ παρεστηκότες ἐκεῖ ἔναντι Κυρίου· μερίδα 8
μεμερισμένην φάγεται, πλὴν τῆς πράσεως τῆς κατὰ πατριάν.
Ἐὰν δὲ σὺ εἰσέλθῃς εἰς τὴν γῆν ἣν Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου δίδωσί 9
σοι, οὐ μαθήσῃ ποιεῖν κατὰ τὰ βδελύγματα τῶν ἐθνῶν ἐκείνων·
οὐχ εὑρεθήσεται ἐν σοὶ περικαθαίρων τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ ἢ τὴν θυγατέρα 10
αὐτοῦ ἐν πυρί, μαντευόμενος μαντείαν, καὶ κληδονιζόμενος, καὶ
οἰωνιζόμενος, φαρμακός, ἐπαοιδὸν ἐπαοιδήν, ἐγγαστρίμυθος, καὶ 11
τερατοσκόπος, καὶ ἐπερωτῶν τοὺς νεκρούς· ἔστι γὰρ βδέλυγμα 12
Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ σου πᾶς ποιῶν ταῦτα· ἕνεκεν γὰρ τῶν βδελυγμάτων
τούτων Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου ἐξολοθρεύσει αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ προ-
σώπου σου. Τέλειος ἔσῃ ἔναντι Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ σου· 14 τὰ γὰρ 13
ἔθνη ταῦτα, οώς σὺ κατακληρονομεῖς αὐτούς, οὗτοι κληδονισμῶν
καὶ μαντειῶν ἀκούσονται· σοὶ δὲ οὐχ οὕτως ἔδωκε Κύριος ὁ Θεός
σου. Προφήτην ἐκ μέσου σου ἐκ τῶν ἀδελφῶν σου, ὡς ἐμέ, ἀναστήσει 15
σοι Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου, αὐτοῦ ἀκούσεσθε· κατὰ πάντα ὅσα 16
ᾐτήσω παρὰ Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ σου ἐν Χωρὴβ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῆς ἐκκλησίας,
λέγοντες· οὐ προσθήσομεν τοῦ ἀκοῦσαι τὴν φωνὴν Κυρίου
τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν, καὶ τὸ πῦρ τὸ μέγα τοῦτο οὐκ ὀψόμεθα ἔτι, οὐδὲ
μὴ ἀποθάνωμεν. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρός με· ὀρθῶς πάντα ὅσα ἐλάλησαν. 17
Προφήτην ἀναστήσω αὐτοῖς ἐκ μέσου τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτῶν, 18
ὥσπερ σέ, καὶ δώσω τὸ ῥῆμά μου ἐν τῷ στόματι αὐτοῦ, καὶ λαλήσει
αὐτοῖς καθ’ ὅτι ἂν ἐντείλωμαι αὐτῷ· καὶ ὁ ἄνθρωπος (ἐκεῖνος) 19
ὃς ἐὰν μὴ ἀκούσῃ τῶν λόγων αὐτοῦ, ὅσα ἐὰν λαλήσῃ ἐπὶ
τῷ ὀνόματι μου ὁ προφήτης, ἐγὼ ἐκδικήσω ἐξ αὐτοῦ. Πλὴν ὁ 20
προφήτης ὃς ἐὰν ἀσεβήσῃ λαλῆσαι ῥῆμα ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι μου ὃ
οὐ προσέταξα αὐτῷ λαλῆσαι, καὶ ὃς ἐὰν λαλήσῃ ἐπ’ ὀνόματι θεῶν
ἑτέρων, ἀποθανεῖται ὁ προφήτης ἐκεῖνος. Ἐὰν δὲ εἴπῃς ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ 21
σου· πῶς γνωσόμεθα τὸ ῥῆμα ὃ οὐκ ἐλάλησε Κύριος; ὅσα 22
ἐὰν λαλήσῃ ὁ προφήτης ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι Κυρίου, καὶ μὴ γένηται
τὸ ῥῆμα, καὶ μὴ συμβῇ, τοῦτο τὸ ῥῆμα, ὃ οὐκ ἐλάλησε Κύριος·
ἐν ἀσεβείᾳ ἐλάλησεν αὐτὸ ὁ προφήτης (ἐκεῖνος), οὐκ ἀρέξεσθε ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ.

### Literary Translation

**Deuteronomy 18**

[6] in the Name of the Lord, he and his sons all their days. And if a Levite shall come from one of your cities, from among all the sons of Israel, where he sojourneth, according as his soul desires, unto the place which the Lord shall choose, [7] then shall he minister in the Name of the Lord his God, even as all his brethren the Levites who stand there before the Lord. [8] A portion, even a portion meted out, shall he eat, besides the price of his patrimony.

[9] When thou shalt come into the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations. [10] There shall not be found within thee one that purgeth his son or his daughter with fire, one divining a divination, or an omen-reader, [11] or a bird-augur, or a sorcerer, one charming a charm, a spirit-conjurer, or one who observes portents, or one who questions the dead. [12] For an abomination unto the Lord thy God is everyone that doeth these things; and because of these abominations shall the Lord thy God utterly destroy them from before thy face.

[13] Thou shalt be perfect before the Lord thy God. [14] For these nations, whom thou shalt dispossess them, these hearken unto omens and divinations; but to thee hath the Lord thy God not so given.

[15] A Prophet from the midst of thee, from among thy brethren, like unto me, shall the Lord thy God raise up for thee; to him shall ye hearken, [16] according to all that which thou didst ask of the Lord thy God in Horeb on the day of the assembly, saying: “We shall not again hear the voice of the Lord our God, neither shall we behold this great fire again, lest we die.” [17] And the Lord said unto me: “They have spoken aright, all that they have spoken. [18] A Prophet will I raise up for them from the midst of their brethren, like unto thee; and I will put My Word in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that which I shall command him. [19] And the man (that one) who shall not hearken unto his words, all that which the prophet shall speak in My Name, I Myself shall exact judgment from him.

[20] But the prophet who shall presumptuously speak a word in My Name which I have not commanded him to speak, and who shall speak in the name of other gods, that prophet shall surely die. [21] And if thou shouldst say in thine heart: “How shall we know the word which the Lord hath not spoken?” [22] Whatsoever the prophet shall speak in the Name of the Lord, and the word doth not come to pass, and it doth not come to be fulfilled, that is the word which the Lord hath not spoken; in presumption hath the prophet (that one) spoken it, ye shall not regard him.
