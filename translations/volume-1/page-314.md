ΚΕΦ. ΛΓ. XXXIII.

ΚΑΙ οὗτοι οἱ σταθμοὶ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, ὡς ἐξῆλθον ἐκ γῆς 1
Αἰγύπτου σὺν δυνάμει αὐτῶν ἐν χειρὶ Μωυσῆ καὶ Ἀαρών. Καὶ 2
ἔγραψε Μωυσῆς τὰς ἀπάρσεις αὐτῶν καὶ τοὺς σταθμοὺς αὐτῶν
διὰ ῥήματος Κυρίου· καὶ οὗτοι οἱ σταθμοὶ αὐτῶν, καὶ τῆς πορείας
αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἀπῆραν ἐκ Ῥαμεσσὴ τῷ μηνὶ τῷ πρώτῳ τῇ 3
πεντεκαιδεκάτῃ ἡμέρᾳ τοῦ μηνὸς τοῦ πρώτου, τῇ ἐπαύριον τοῦ
πάσχα ἐξῆλθον οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐν χειρὶ ὑψηλῇ ἐναντίον πάντων
τῶν Αἰγυπτίων. Καὶ οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι ἔθαπτον ἐξ αὐτῶν τοὺς τεθνη- 4
κότας πάντας ὅσους ἐπάταξε Κύριος, πᾶν πρωτότοκον ἐν γῇ Αἰ-
γύπτου· καὶ ἐν τοῖς θεοῖς αὐτῶν ἐποίησε τὴν ἐκδίκησιν Κύριος.
Ἀπάραντες δὲ οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐκ Ῥαμεσσῆ, παρενέβαλον εἰς Σοκ- 5
χώθ. Καὶ ἀπάραντες ἐκ Σοκχώθ, παρενέβαλον εἰς Βουθάν, ὅ ἐστι 6
μέρος (τι) τῆς ἐρήμου. Καὶ ἀπῆραν ἐκ Βουθάν, καὶ παρενέβαλον 7
ἐπὶ στόμα Εἰρώθ, ὅ ἐστι, ἀπέναντι Βεελσεφών, καὶ παρενέβαλον
ἀπέναντι Μαγδώλου. Καὶ ἀπῆραν ἀπέναντι Εἰρώθ, καὶ διέβησαν 8
μέσον τῆς θαλάσσης εἰς τὴν ἔρημον· καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν ὁδὸν τριῶν
ἡμερῶν διὰ τῆς ἐρήμου αὐτοί, καὶ παρενέβαλον ἐν Πιχιραῖς. Καὶ 9
ἀπῆραν ἐκ Πιχιρῶν, καὶ ἦλθον εἰς Αἰλείμ· καὶ ἐν Αἰλεὶμ δώδεκα
πηγαὶ ὑδάτων (ὑδάτων) καὶ ἑβδομήκοντα στελέχη φοινίκων, καὶ
παρενέβαλον ἐκεῖ παρὰ τὸ ὕδωρ. Καὶ ἀπῆραν ἐξ Αἰλείμ, καὶ 10
παρενέβαλον ἐπὶ θάλασσαν ἐρυθράν. Καὶ ἀπῆραν ἀπὸ θαλάσ- 11
σης ἐρυθρᾶς, καὶ παρενέβαλον ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ Σίν. Καὶ ἀπῆραν ἐκ 12
τῆς ἐρήμου Σίν, καὶ παρενέβαλον εἰς Ῥαφακά. Καὶ ἀπῆραν ἐκ 13
Ῥαφακά, καὶ παρενέβαλον ἐν Αἰλούς. Καὶ ἀπῆραν ἐξ Αἰλοῦς, 14
καὶ παρενέβαλον ἐν Ῥαφιδείν· καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἐκεῖ ὕδωρ τῷ λαῷ πι-
εῖν. Καὶ ἀπῆραν ἐκ Ῥαφιδείν, καὶ παρενέβαλον ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ τῇ 15
Σινᾷ. Καὶ ἀπῆραν ἐκ τῆς ἐρήμου Σινᾷ, καὶ παρενέβαλον ἐν Μνη- 16
μᾶσι τῆς ἐπιθυμίας. Καὶ ἀπῆραν ἐκ Μνημάτων τῆς ἐπιθυμίας, καὶ 17
παρενέβαλον ἐν Ἀσηρώθ. Καὶ ἀπῆραν ἐξ Ἀσηρώθ, καὶ παρενέβα- 18
λον ἐν Ῥαθαμᾶ. Καὶ ἀπῆραν ἐκ Ῥαθαμᾶ, καὶ παρενέβαλον ἐν 19
Ῥεμμὼν Φαρές. Καὶ ἀπῆραν ἐκ Ῥεμμὼν Φαρές, καὶ παρενέβαλον 20
ἐν Λεβωνᾷ. Καὶ ἀπῆραν ἐκ Λεβωνᾶ, καὶ παρενέβαλον εἰς Ῥεσσᾶ. 21
Καὶ ἀπῆραν ἐκ Ῥεσσᾶ, καὶ παρενέβαλον εἰς Μακελάθ. Καὶ 22
ἀπῆραν ἐκ Μακελάθ, καὶ παρενέβαλον ἐν Ἀρασάρθ. Καὶ ἀπῆραν 23
