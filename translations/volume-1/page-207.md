ΛΕΥΙΤΙΚΟΝ ΚΕΦ. ΙΑ´. ΙΒ´.
διαπαντὸς, ὃ πολυπληθεῖ ποσὶν ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς ἑρπετοῖς τοῖς ἑρπουσιν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, οὐ φάγεσθε αὐτὸ, ὅτι βδέλυγμα ὑμῖν ἐστι.
43 Καὶ οὐ μὴ βδελύξητε τὰς ψυχὰς ὑμῶν ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς ἑρπετοῖς τοῖς ἑρπουσιν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, καὶ οὐ μιανθήσεσθε ἐν τούτοις, καὶ οὐκ ἀκάθαρτοι ἔσεσθε ἐν αὐτοῖς,
44 ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν· καὶ ἁγιασθήσεσθε, καὶ ἅγιοι ἔσεσθε, ὅτι ἅγιός εἰμι ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν·
45 καὶ οὐ μιανεῖτε τὰς ψυχὰς ὑμῶν ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς ἑρπετοῖς τοῖς κινουμένοις ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι Κύριος ὁ ἀναγαγὼν ὑμᾶς ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, εἶναι ὑμῶν Θεός· καὶ ἅγιοι ἔσεσθε,
46 ὅτι ἅγιός εἰμι ἐγὼ (Κύριος). Οὗτος ὁ νόμος περὶ τῶν κτηνῶν, καὶ τῶν πετεινῶν, καὶ πάσης ψυχῆς ζώσης, τῆς κινουμένης ἐν τῷ ὕδατι, καὶ πάσης ψυχῆς ἑρπούσης ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς,
47 διαστεῖλαι ἀναμέσον τῶν ἀκαθάρτων καὶ ἀναμέσον τῶν καθαρῶν, καὶ ἀναμέσον τῶν ζωογονουμένων τὰ ἐσθιόμενα, καὶ ἀναμέσον τῶν ζωογονούντων τὰ μὴ ἐσθιόμενα.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΒ´. ΧΙΙ.

1 **ΚΑΙ** ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, λέγων·
2 λάλησον τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτοὺς· γυνὴ ἥτις ἐὰν σπερματισθῇ, καὶ τέκῃ ἄρσεν, καὶ ἀκάθαρτος ἔσται ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας· κατὰ τὰς
3 ἡμέρας τοῦ χωρισμοῦ τῆς ἀφέδρου αὐτῆς ἀκάθαρτος ἔσται· καὶ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ὀγδόῃ περιτεμεῖ τὴν σάρκα τῆς ἀκροβυστίας αὐτοῦ·
4 καὶ τριάκοντα ἡμέρας καὶ τρεῖς καθήσεται ἐν αἵματι καθαρῷ αὐτῆς· παντὸς ἁγίου οὐχ ἅψεται, καὶ εἰς τὸ ἁγιαστήριον οὐκ εἰσελεύσεται, ἕως οὗ πληρωθῶσιν αἱ ἡμέραι καθάρσεως αὐτῆς.
5 Ἐὰν δὲ θῆλυ τέκῃ, καὶ ἀκάθαρτος ἔσται δὶς ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας, κατὰ τὴν ἀφεδρον αὐτῆς· καὶ ἑξήκοντα ἡμέρας καὶ ἓξ καθήσεται ἐν αἵματι καθαρῷ αὐτῆς.
6 Καὶ ὅταν ἀναπληρωθῶσιν αἱ ἡμέραι καθάρσεως αὐτῆς ἐφ᾿ υἱῷ ἢ ἐπὶ θυγατρί, προσείσει ἀμνὸν ἐνιαύσιον ἄμωμον εἰς ὁλοκαύτωμα, καὶ νοσσὸν περιστερᾶς ἢ τρυγόνα περὶ ἁμαρτίας, ἐπὶ τὴν θύραν τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου πρὸς τὸν ἱερέα·
7 καὶ προσείσει αὐτὸν ἔναντι Κυρίου· καὶ ἐξιλάσεται περὶ αὐτῆς ὁ ἱερεὺς, καὶ καθαριεῖ αὐτὴν ἀπὸ τῆς πηγῆς τοῦ αἵματος αὐτῆς· οὗτος ὁ νόμος τῆς τικτούσης ἄρσεν ἢ θῆλυ.
8 Ἐὰν δὲ μὴ εὑρίσκῃ ἡ χεὶρ αὐτῆς τὸ ἱκανὸν εἰς ἀμνὸν, καὶ λήψεται δύο τρυγόνας ἢ δύο νεοσσούς.

**Leviticus 11**

**42** Continually, that [creature] which hath many feet among all the creeping things that creep upon the earth, ye shall not eat it; for it is an abomination unto you.
**43** Ye shall not make abominable your souls by all the creeping things that creep upon the earth; neither shall ye be defiled by them, nor be made unclean thereby;
**44** For I am the Lord your God: ye shall be sanctified, and ye shall be holy; for I am holy, the Lord your God.
**45** And ye shall not defile your souls by all the creeping things that move upon the earth, for I am the Lord, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God. And ye shall be holy,
**46** for I am holy (the Lord). This is the law concerning the beasts, and the fowls, and every living soul that moveth in the waters, and every soul that creepeth upon the earth;
**47** To make distinction between the unclean and between the clean; and between them that are quickened, the things which are eaten; and between them that quicken, the things which are not eaten.

**Leviticus 12**

**1** And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying:
**2** "Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If a woman conceive seed, and bear a man child, then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days
**3** of the separation for her monthly discharge, she shall be unclean. And on the eighth day, he shall circumcise the flesh of his foreskin.
**4** And thirty days and three shall she abide in her clean blood. She shall touch no hallowed thing, nor enter into the sanctuary, until the days of her purification be fulfilled.
**5** But if she bear a female child, then she shall be unclean twice seven days, according to her monthly discharge; and sixty days and six shall she abide in her clean blood.
**6** And when the days of her purification are fulfilled for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering, unto the door of the tent of testimony, unto the priest.
**7** And he shall bring it before the Lord, and the priest shall make atonement for her, and shall cleanse her from the fountain of her blood. This is the law for her that beareth a male or a female.
**8** And if her hand find not sufficient for a lamb, then she shall take two turtledoves, or two young pigeons,"
