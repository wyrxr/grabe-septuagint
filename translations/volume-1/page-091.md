76 ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ ΚΕΦ. ΜΑ΄.
35 ἐτῶν τῆς εὐθηνίας· καὶ συναγαγέτωσαν πάντα τὰ βρώματα τῶν
ἑπτὰ ἐτῶν τῶν ἐρχομένων τῶν καλῶν τούτων, καὶ συναχθήτω ὁ
σῖτος ὑπὸ χεῖρα Φαραὼ βρώματα ἐν ταῖς πόλεσι φυλαχθήτω·
36 καὶ ἔσται τὰ βρώματα πεφυλαγμένα τῇ γῇ εἰς τὰ ἑπτὰ ἔτη τοῦ
λιμοῦ, ἃ ἔσονται ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ, καὶ οὐκ ἐκτριβήσεται ἡ γῆ ἐν
37 τῷ λιμῷ. Ἤρεσε δὲ τὰ ῥήματα ἐναντίον Φαραώ, καὶ ἐναντίον
38 πάντων τῶν παίδων αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπε Φαραὼ (πᾶσι) τοῖς παισὶν
αὐτοῦ· μὴ εὑρήσομεν ἄνθρωπον τοιοῦτον, ὃς ἔχει πνεῦμα Θεοῦ
39 ἐν αὐτῷ; Εἶπε δὲ Φαραὼ τῷ Ἰωσήφ· ἐπειδὴ ἔδειξεν ὁ Θεός σοι
πάντα ταῦτα, οὐκ ἔστιν ἄνθρωπος φρονιμώτερός σου καὶ συνε-
40 τώτερος. Σὺ ἔσῃ ἐπὶ τῷ οἴκῳ μου, καὶ ἐπὶ τῷ στόματί σου
ὑπακούσεται πᾶς ὁ λαός μου· πλὴν τὸν θρόνον ὑπερέξω σου ἐγώ.
41 Εἶπε δὲ Φαραὼ τῷ Ἰωσήφ· ἰδοὺ καθίστημί σε σήμερον ἐπὶ πά-
42 σης γῆς Αἰγύπτου. Καὶ περιελόμενος Φαραὼ τὸν δακτύλιον ἀπὸ
τῆς χειρὸς αὐτοῦ, περιέθηκεν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὴν χεῖρα Ἰωσήφ· καὶ ἐνέ-
δυσεν αὐτὸν στολὴν βυσσίνην, καὶ περιέθηκε χλοιδὸν χρυσοῦν περὶ
43 τὸν τράχηλον αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἀνεβίβασεν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὸ ἅρμα τὸ δεύ-
τερον τῶν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐκήρυξεν ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ κῆρυξ· καὶ κα-
44 τέστησεν αὐτὸν ἐφ’ ὅλης τῆς γῆς Αἰγύπτου. Εἶπε δὲ Φαραὼ τῷ
Ἰωσήφ· ἐγὼ Φαραώ· ἄνευ σοῦ οὐκ ἐξαρεῖ οὐθεὶς τὴν χεῖρα αὐ-
45 τοῦ ἐπὶ πάσῃ γῇ Αἰγύπτου. Καὶ ἐκάλεσε Φαραὼ τὸ ὄνομα Ἰω-
σήφ, Ψονθομφανήχ· καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ τὴν Ἀσενὲθ θυγατέρα Πε-
46 τεφρῆ ἱερέως Ἡλιουπόλεως αὐτῷ εἰς γυναῖκα. Ἰωσὴφ δὲ ἦν
ἐτῶν τριάκοντα, ὅτε ἔστη ἐναντίον Φαραὼ βασιλέως Αἰγύπτου.
Ἐξῆλθε δὲ Ἰωσὴφ ἐκ προσώπου Φαραώ, καὶ διῆλθε πᾶσαν γῆν
47 Αἰγύπτου. Καὶ ἐποίησεν ἡ γῆ ἐν τοῖς ἑπτὰ ἔτεσι τῆς εὐθηνίας
48 δράγματα· καὶ συνήγαγε πάντα τὰ βρώματα τῶν ἑπτὰ ἐτῶν,
ἐν οἷς ἦν ἡ εὐθηνία ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτου, καὶ ἔθηκε τὰ βρώματα ἐν
ταῖς πόλεσι· βρώματα τῶν πεδίων τῆς πόλεως τῶν κύκλῳ αὐ-
49 τῆς (Ὤν) ἔθηκεν ἐν αὐτῇ. Καὶ συνήγαγεν Ἰωσὴφ σῖτον ὡσεὶ τὴν
ἄμμον τῆς θαλάσσης πολὺν σφόδρα, ἕως οὐκ ἠδύνατο ἀριθμῆσαι·
50 οὐ γὰρ ἦν ἀριθμός. Τῷ δὲ Ἰωσὴφ ἐγένοντο υἱοὶ δύο, πρὸ τοῦ
ἐλθεῖν τὰ ἑπτὰ ἔτη τοῦ λιμοῦ, οὓς ἔτεκεν αὐτῷ Ἀσενέθ, θυγά-
51 τὴρ Πετεφρῆ ἱερέως Ἡλιουπόλεως. Ἐκάλεσε δὲ Ἰωσὴφ τὸ ὄνομα
τοῦ πρωτοτόκου, Μανασσῆ, λέγων· ὅτι ἐπιλαθέσθαι με ἐποίησεν
ὁ Θεὸς πάντων τῶν πόνων μου, καὶ πάντων τῶν τοῦ πατρός μου.

### Genesis, Chapter 41

35 of the years of plenty; and let them gather all the provisions of these seven good years that are coming, and let the grain be gathered under the hand of Pharaoh, and let the provisions be kept in the cities.
36 And these provisions shall be kept for the land for the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; so the land shall not be utterly destroyed by the famine.
37 And the words pleased Pharaoh, and all his servants likewise.
38 And Pharaoh said unto all his servants, "Shall we find such a man as this, in whom the Spirit of God is?"
39 Then Pharaoh said unto Joseph, "Forasmuch as God hath shown thee all these things, there is none wiser nor more discerning than thou.
40 Thou shalt be over my house, and according to thy word shall all my people obey; only in the throne will I be greater than thou."
41 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, "Behold, I do set thee this day over all the land of Egypt."
42 And Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand; and he clothed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a chain of gold about his neck.
43 And he made him ride in the second chariot that he had, and a herald proclaimed before him; and he appointed him over all the land of Egypt.
44 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, "I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand in all the land of Egypt."
45 And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Psonthomphanech; and he gave him Aseneth, the daughter of Petiphre, priest of Heliopolis, to wife.
46 Now Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh, king of Egypt. And Joseph went forth from the presence of Pharaoh, and passed through all the land of Egypt.
47 And the land brought forth [in] the seven years of plenty
48 sheaves; and he gathered all the provisions of the seven years, in which there was plenty in the land of Egypt, and he laid up the provisions in the cities. The provisions of the fields of the city round about it,
49 these he laid up within it. And Joseph gathered grain as the sand of the sea, exceeding much, until it could not be numbered; for there was no number [to it].
50 And unto Joseph were born two sons before the seven years of famine came, whom Aseneth, the daughter of Petiphre, priest of Heliopolis, bare unto him.
51 And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh, saying, "For God hath made me to forget all my labours, and all the [sorrows of] my father's house."
