ΚΕΦ. Ιʹ. ΙΑʹ. ΛΕΥΙΤΙΚΟΝ 189
ἁγία ἁγίων ἐστί· καὶ φάγεσθε αὐτὴν ἐν τόπῳ ἁγίῳ· νόμιμον γὰρ 13
σοι ἐστί, καὶ νόμιμον τοῖς υἱοῖς σου τοῦτο ἀπὸ τῶν καρπωμάτων
Κυρίου· οὕτω γὰρ ἐντέταλταί μοι. Καὶ τὸ **στηθύνιον** τοῦ ἀφορί- 14
σματος, καὶ τὸν βραχίονα τοῦ ἀφαιρέματος φάγεσθε ἐν τόπῳ
ἁγίῳ, σὺ καὶ οἱ υἱοί σου καὶ ὁ οἶκός σου μετὰ σοῦ· νόμιμον γάρ
σοι, καὶ νόμιμον τοῖς υἱοῖς σου ἐδόθη ἀπὸ τῶν θυσιῶν τοῦ σω-
τηρίου τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ. Τὸν βραχίονα τοῦ ἀφαιρέματος, καὶ τὸ 15
**στηθύνιον** τοῦ ἀφορίσματος ἐπὶ τῶν καρπωμάτων τῶν στεάτων
προσοίσουσιν, ἀφόρισμα ἀφορίσαι ἔναντι Κυρίου· καὶ ἔσται σοι
καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς σου καὶ ταῖς θυγατράσι σου μετὰ σοῦ νόμιμον αἰώ-
νιον, ὃν τρόπον συνέταξε Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ. Καὶ τὸν χίμαρον 16
τὸν περὶ τῆς ἁμαρτίας ζητῶν ἐξεζήτησε Μωυσῆς· καὶ ὁ δὲ ἐμπε-
πύριστο. Καὶ ἐθυμώθη Μωυσῆς ἐπὶ Ἐλεάζαρ καὶ Ἰθάμαρ (τοὺς
ἱερεῖς), τοὺς υἱοὺς ᾿Ααρὼν τοὺς καταλελειμμένους, λέγων· διατὶ 17
οὐκ ἐφάγετε τὸ περὶ τῆς ἁμαρτίας ἐν τόπῳ ἁγίῳ; ὅτι γὰρ ἁγία
ἁγίων ἐστί, τοῦτο ἔδωκεν ὑμῖν φαγεῖν, ἵνα ἀφέλητε τὴν ἁμαρτίαν
τῆς συναγωγῆς, καὶ ἐξιλάσησθε περὶ αὐτῶν ἔναντι Κυρίου. Οὐ 18
γὰρ εἰσῆλθεν τοῦ αἵματος αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸ ἅγιον (κατὰ πρόσωπον)
ἔσω· φάγεσθε αὐτὸ ἐν τόπῳ ἁγίῳ, ὃν τρόπον μοι συνέταξε Κύ-
ριος. Καὶ ἐλάλησεν ᾿Ααρὼν πρὸς Μωυσῆν, (λέγων)· εἰ σήμερον 19
προσαγήγασι τὰ περὶ τῆς ἁμαρτίας αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰ ὁλοκαυτώμα-
τα αὐτῶν ἔναντι Κυρίου, καὶ συμβέβηκέ μοι ταῦτα, καὶ φάγομαι
τὰ περὶ τῆς ἁμαρτίας σήμερον, μὴ ἀρεστὸν ἔσται Κυρίῳ; Καὶ 20
ἤκουσε Μωυσῆς, καὶ ἤρεσεν αὐτῷ.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΑʹ. ΧΙ.

ΚΑὶ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν καὶ ᾿Ααρών, λέγων πρὸς 1
αὐτούς· λαλήσατε τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ, λέγοντες· ταῦτα τὰ κτήνη, 2
ἃ φάγεσθε ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν κτηνῶν τῶν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς· πᾶν κτῆ- 3
νος διχηλοῦν ὁπλὴν καὶ ὀνυχιστῆρας ὀνυχίζον δύο χηλῶν, καὶ
ἀνάγον μηρυκισμὸν ἐν τοῖς κτήνεσι, ταῦτα φάγεσθε. Πλὴν ἀπὸ 4
τούτων οὐ φάγεσθε, ἀπὸ τῶν ἀναγόντων μηρυκισμόν, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν
διχηλούντων τὰς ὁπλάς, καὶ ὀνυχικόντων ὀνυχιστῆρας· τὸν χά-
μηλον, ὅτι ἀνάγει μηρυκισμὸν τοῦτο, ὁπλὴν δὲ οὐ διχηλεῖ, ἀκά-
θαρτον τοῦτο ὑμῖν· καὶ τὸν δασύποδα, ὅτι ἀνάγει μηρυκισμὸν τοῦτο, 5

### CHAPTER 10

13 It is most holy; and ye shall eat it in a holy place: for it is a due unto thee, and a due unto thy sons, this [portion] from the Lord’s offerings; for thus hath it been commanded unto me.

14 And the breast of the heave offering, and the shoulder of the wave offering, ye shall eat in a holy place, thou and thy sons and thy household with thee; for a due was it given unto thee, and a due unto thy sons, from the sacrifices of salvation of the sons of Israel.

15 The shoulder of the wave offering, and the breast of the heave offering, they shall bring with the offerings of the fats, as a heave offering to heave before the Lord; and it shall be unto thee and unto thy sons and unto thy daughters with thee a perpetual due, in the manner the Lord did command Moses.

16 And Moses did diligently seek out the kid of the sin offering, and lo, it had been consumed by fire. And Moses was wroth with Eleazar and Ithamar, (who were the priests), the sons of Aaron who were left, saying:

17 “Wherefore did ye not eat the sin offering in the holy place? For since it is most holy, this hath He given unto you to eat, that ye might take away the sin of the congregation, and make atonement concerning them before the Lord.

18 For the blood thereof did not enter into the Holy [Place] (according to its appearance) within; ye shall eat it in a holy place, in the manner the Lord commanded me.”

19 And Aaron spoke unto Moses, (saying): “Behold, this day have they brought their sin offerings and their burnt offerings before the Lord, and these things have befallen me; and shall I eat the sin offering today? Will it then be pleasing unto the Lord?”

20 And Moses heard, and it was pleasing unto him.

### CHAPTER 11

1 And the Lord spoke unto Moses and Aaron, saying unto them:

2 “Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying: These are the animals which ye shall eat from all the animals upon the earth.

3 Every animal that hath a cloven hoof and [a hoof] parted into two claws, and that cheweth the cud among the animals, these ye shall eat.

4 Howbeit, from these ye shall not eat: from those which chew the cud, and from those which have cloven hoofs, and from those which have parted hoofs— the camel, because this cheweth the cud, but hath not a cloven hoof, this is unclean unto you;

5 And the rock badger, because this cheweth the cud,
