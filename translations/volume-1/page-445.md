ΚΡΙΤΑΙ ΚΕΦ Γʹ.

3 αὐτοὺς πόλεμον, πλὴν οἱ ἔμπροσθεν αὐτῶν οὐκ ἔγνωσαν αὐτά· τὰς
    πέντε σατραπίας τῶν ἀλλοφύλων, καὶ πάντα τὸν Χαναναῖον, καὶ
    τὸν Σιδώνιον, καὶ τὸν Εὐαῖον τὸν κατοικοῦντα τὸν Λίβανον ἀπὸ
4 τοῦ ὄρους τοῦ Βααλερμὼν ἕως Λεωθημάθ. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὥστε πει-
    ράσαι ἐν αὐτοῖς τὸν Ἰσραήλ, γνῶναι εἰ ἀκούσονται τὰς ἐντολὰς
5 Κυρίου, ἃς ἐνετείλατο τοῖς πατράσιν αὐτῶν ἐν χειρὶ Μωσῆ. Καὶ
    οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ κατώικησαν ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ Χαναναίου, καὶ τοῦ Χετ-
    ταίου, καὶ τοῦ Ἀμοῤῥαίου, καὶ τοῦ Φερεζαίου, καὶ τοῦ Εὐαίου,
6 καὶ τοῦ Ἰεβουσαίου· καὶ ἔλαβον τὰς θυγατέρας αὐτῶν ἑαυτοῖς εἰς
    γυναῖκας, καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας αὐτῶν ἔδωκαν τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτῶν,
7 καὶ ἐλάτρευσαν τοῖς θεοῖς αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐποίησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ
    τὸ πονηρὸν ἔναντι Κυρίου, καὶ ἐπελάθοντο Κυρίου Θεοῦ αὐτῶν,
8 καὶ ἐλάτρευσαν τοῖς Βααλεὶμ καὶ τοῖς ἄλσεσι. Καὶ ὠργίσθη θυ-
    μῷ Κύριος ἐν τῷ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἀπέδοτο αὐτοὺς εἰς χεῖρας Χου-
    σαρσαθαὶμ βασιλέως Συρίας (Μεσοποταμίας) ποταμῶν· καὶ ἐδού-
9 λευσαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ τῷ Χουσαρσαθαὶμ ὀκτὼ ἔτη. Καὶ ἐκέ-
    κραξαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς Κύριον, καὶ ἤγειρε Κύριος σωτῆρα
    τῷ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἔσωσεν αὐτούς, τὸν Γοθονιήλ, υἱὸν Κενὲζ ἀδελ-
10 φοῦ Χάλεβ τὸν νεώτερον αὐτοῦ· καὶ εἰσήκουσεν αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐγέ-
    νετο ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν πνεῦμα Κυρίου, καὶ ἔκρινε τὸν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐξῆλ-
    θεν ἐπὶ τὸν πόλεμον· καὶ παρέδωκε Κύριος ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ τὸν
    Χουσαρσαθαὶμ βασιλέα Συρίας, καὶ ἐκραταιώθη χεὶρ αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὸν
11 Χουσαρσαθαίμ. Καὶ ἡσύχασεν ἡ γῆ ἔτη τεσσαράκοντα· καὶ ἀπέ-
12 θανε Γοθονιὴλ υἱὸς Κενέζ. Καὶ προσέθεντο οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ποι-
    ῆσαι τὸ πονηρὸν ἔναντι Κυρίου· καὶ ἐνίσχυσε Κύριος τὸν Ἐγλὼμ
    βασιλέα Μωὰβ ἐπὶ τὸν Ἰσραήλ, διὰ τὸ πεποιηκέναι αὐτοὺς τὸ
13 πονηρὸν ἔναντι Κυρίου. Καὶ προσήγαγε πρὸς αὐτὸν πάντας
    τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἄμμων καὶ Ἀμαλήκ· καὶ ἐπορεύθη, καὶ ἐπάτα-
14 ξε τὸν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐκληρονόμησε τὴν πόλιν τῶν φοινίκων. Καὶ
    ἐδούλευσαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ τῷ Ἐγλὼμ βασιλεῖ Μωὰβ ἔτη δέκα ὀκτώ.
15 Καὶ ἐκέκραξαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς Κύριον· καὶ ἤγει-
    ρεν αὐτοῖς Κύριος σωτῆρα, τὸν Ἀώδ, υἱὸν Γηρὰ υἱοῦ τοῦ Ἰεμε-
    νεί, ἄνδρα ἀμφοτεροδέξιον· καὶ ἀπέστειλαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ δῶρα
16 ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ τῷ Ἐγλὼμ βασιλεῖ Μωάβ. Καὶ ἐποίησεν ἑαυτῷ
    Ἀὼδ μάχαιραν δίστομον, σπιθαμῆς τὸ μῆκος αὐτῆς· καὶ περιε-
    ζώσατο αὐτὴν ὑπὸ τὸν μανδύαν αὐτοῦ, ἐπὶ τὸν μηρὸν τὸν δεξιὸν

**JUDGES**
**CHAPTER 3.**

**3.** them war, save those who had not known them before; [namely,]
    the five lordships of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites,
    and the Sidonians, and the Hivites who dwelt Mount Lebanon
    from Mount Baal-Hermon unto Lebo-Hamath.
**4.** And it came to pass, [these were] for the testing of Israel by them,
    to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the Lord,
    which He commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.
**5.** And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites,
    and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites,
    and the Hivites, and the Jebusites;
**6.** And they took their daughters unto themselves for wives,
    and their daughters they gave unto their sons,
**7.** and served their gods.
    And the children of Israel wrought wickedness before the Lord,
    and they forgot the Lord their God,
    and served the Baalim and the groves.
**8.** And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel,
    and He sold them into the hand of Chusarsathaim,
    king of Syria, (Mesopotamia) of rivers;
    and the children of Israel served Chusarsathaim eight years.
**9.** And the children of Israel cried unto the Lord,
    and the Lord raised up a savior to Israel, who saved them,
    even Othniel, the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother;
    and He heard them.
**10.** And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him,
    and he judged Israel, and went forth to war;
    and the Lord delivered into his hand Chusarsathaim, king of Syria,
    and his hand was mighty over Chusarsathaim.
**11.** And the land had rest forty years.
    And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.
**12.** And the children of Israel again wrought wickedness before the Lord;
    and the Lord strengthened Eglon, the king of Moab, against Israel,
    because they had done evil before the Lord.
**13.** And he gathered unto him all the children of Ammon and Amalek;
    and he went and smote Israel,
    and took possession of the city of palms.
**14.** And the children of Israel served Eglon, the king of Moab, eighteen years.
**15.** And the children of Israel cried unto the Lord;
    and the Lord raised them up a savior,
    Ehud, the son of Gera, the son of the Benjamite,
    a man ambidextrous;
    and the children of Israel sent gifts by his hand unto Eglon, the king of Moab.
**16.** And Ehud made him a sword which had two edges,
    of a span its length;
    and he girded it under his cloak, upon his right thigh.
