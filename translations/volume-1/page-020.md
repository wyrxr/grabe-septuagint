ΚΕΦ. Γ΄. ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ 5
σθε ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ, διανοιγθήσονται ὑμῶν οἱ ὀφθαλμοί, καὶ ἔσεσθε ὡς
Θεοί, γινώσκοντες καλὸν καὶ πονηρόν. Καὶ ἴδεν ἡ γυνὴ ὅτι χα- 6
λὸν τὸ ξύλον εἰς βρῶσιν, καὶ ὅτι ἀρεστὸν τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς ἰδεῖν,
καὶ ὡραῖον ἐστι τοῦ κατανοῆσαι· καὶ λαβοῦσα τοῦ καρποῦ αὐτοῦ
ἔφαγε, καὶ ἔδωκε καὶ τῷ ἀνδρὶ αὐτῆς μετ᾿ αὐτῆς, καὶ ἔφαγον.
Καὶ διηνοίχθησαν οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ τῶν δύο, καὶ ἔγνωσαν ὅτι γυμνοὶ 7
ἦσαν· καὶ ἔῤῥαψαν φύλλα συκῆς, καὶ ἐποίησαν ἑαυτοῖς περιζώμα-
τα. Καὶ ἤκουσαν τὴν φωνὴν Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ περιπατοῦντος ἐν 8
τῷ παραδείσῳ τὸ δειλινόν· καὶ ἐκρύβησαν ὅ τε ᾿Αδὰμ καὶ ἡ γυ-
νὴ αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ προσώπου Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ ξύλου
τοῦ παραδείσου. Καὶ ἐκάλεσε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τὸν ᾿Αδάμ, καὶ εἶ- 9
πεν αὐτῷ· ᾿Αδὰμ ποῦ εἶ; Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· τὴν φωνήν σου ἤ- 10
κουσα (περιπατοῦντος) ἐν τῷ παραδείσῳ, καὶ ἐφοβήθην, ὅτι γυμνὸς
εἰμι, καὶ ἐκρύβην. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· τίς ἀνήγγειλέ σοι ὅτι γυ- 11
μνὸς εἶ, εἰ μὴ ἀπὸ τοῦ ξύλου, οὗ ἐνετειλάμην σοι τούτου μόνου
μὴ φαγεῖν ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἔφαγες; Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ ᾿Αδάμ· ἡ γυνὴ ἣν ἔ- 12
δωκας μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ, αὕτη μοι ἔδωκεν ἀπὸ τοῦ ξύλου, καὶ ἔφαγον.
Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τῇ γυναικί· τί τοῦτο ἐποίησας; Καὶ εἶ- 13
πεν ἡ γυνή· ὁ ὄφις ἠπάτησέ με, καὶ ἔφαγον. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος 14
ὁ Θεὸς τῷ ὄφει· ὅτι ἐποίησας τοῦτο, ἐπικατάρατος σὺ ἀπὸ πάν-
των τῶν κτηνῶν, καὶ ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν θηρίων (τῶν ἐπὶ) τῆς γῆς·
ἐπὶ τῷ στήθει σου καὶ τῇ κοιλίᾳ πορεύσῃ, καὶ γῆν φαγῇ πάσας
τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς ζωῆς σου. Καὶ ἔχθραν θήσω ἀνὰ μέσον σου καὶ 15
ἀνὰ μέσον τῆς γυναικός, καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον τοῦ σπέρματός σου καὶ
ἀνὰ μέσον τοῦ σπέρματος αὐτῆς· αὐτός σου τηρήσει κεφαλήν, καὶ
σὺ τηρήσεις αὐτοῦ πτέρναν. Καὶ τῇ γυναικὶ εἶπε· πληθύνων πλη- 16
θυνῶ τὰς λύπας σου καὶ τὸν στεναγμόν σου, ἐν λύπαις τέξῃ τέκ-
να· καὶ πρὸς τὸν ἄνδρα σου ἡ ἀποστροφή σου, καὶ αὐτός σου κυ-
ριεύσει. Τῷ δὲ ᾿Αδὰμ εἶπεν· ὅτι ἤκουσας τῆς φωνῆς τῆς γυναι- 17
κός σου, καὶ ἔφαγες ἀπὸ τοῦ ξύλου, οὗ ἐνετειλάμην σοι τούτου
μόνου μὴ φαγεῖν ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ, (ἔφαγες), ἐπικατάρατος ἡ γῆ ἐν τοῖς
ἔργοις σου· ἐν λύπαις φαγῇ αὐτὴν πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς ζωῆς
σου. ᾿Ακάνθας καὶ τριβόλους ἀνατελεῖ σοι, καὶ φαγῇ τὸν χόρτον 18
τοῦ ἀγροῦ. ᾿Εν ἱδρῶτι τοῦ προσώπου σου φαγῇ τὸν ἄρτον σου, 19
ἕως τοῦ ἀποστρέψαι σε εἰς τὴν γῆν ἐξ ἧς ἐλήφθης· ὅτι γῆ εἶ,
καὶ εἰς γῆν ἀπελεύσῃ. Καὶ ἐκάλεσεν ᾿Αδὰμ τὸ ὄνομα τῆς γυ- 20

**Chapter 3**

5 from it; then shall your eyes be opened, and ye shall be as Gods,
knowing good and evil.

6 And the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was
pleasing to the eyes to behold, and fair to look upon, [even] to perceive;
and she took of its fruit and did eat, and gave also to her husband with her,
and they did eat.

7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked;
and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves coverings.

8 And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool
[of the day]; and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the face of the Lord
God in the midst of the tree of the garden.

9 And the Lord God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Adam, where art thou?

10 And he said, I heard thy voice (walking) in the garden, and I was afraid,
because I am naked; and I hid myself.

11 And He said unto him, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten
of the tree, concerning which I commanded thee of this alone, that thou shouldst
not eat of it?

12 And Adam said, The woman whom Thou gavest [to be] with me, she gave me
of the tree, and I did eat.

13 And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done?
And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.

14 And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art
cursed above all cattle, and above all beasts (those upon) the earth;
upon thy breast and upon thy belly shalt thou go, and earth shalt thou eat
all the days of thy life.

15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed
and her seed; he shall watch thy head, and thou shalt watch his heel.

16 And unto the woman He said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrows and thy groaning;
in sorrows shalt thou bring forth children; and toward thy husband shall be thy
turning, and he shall rule over thee.

17 And unto Adam He said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife,
and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee concerning this alone that
thou shouldst not eat of it, (thou hast eaten), cursed is the earth in thy labours;
in sorrows shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life.

18 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the
grass of the field.

19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread, till thou return unto the
earth from whence thou wast taken; for earth thou art, and unto earth shalt thou
return.

20 And Adam called the name of his wife,
