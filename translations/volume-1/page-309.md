κατοικίας αὐτῶν, καὶ πάσας τὰς ἐπαύλεις αὐτῶν ἐνέπρησαν ἐν
11 πυρί. Καὶ ἔλαβον πᾶσαν τὴν προνομήν (αὐτῶν), καὶ πάντα τὰ
12 σκῦλα αὐτῶν ἀπὸ ἀνθρώπου ἕως κτήνους, καὶ ἤγαγον πρὸς
Μωυσῆν καὶ πρὸς Ἐλεάζαρ τὸν ἱερέα καὶ πρὸς πάντας τοὺς υἱ-
οὺς Ἰσραήλ, τὴν αἰχμαλωσίαν καὶ τὰ σκῦλα καὶ τὴν προνομήν
εἰς τὴν παρεμβολὴν εἰς Ἀραβὼθ Μωάβ, ἥ ἐστιν ἐπὶ τοῦ Ἰορδά-
13 νου κατὰ Ἱεριχώ. Καὶ ἐξῆλθε Μωυσῆς καὶ Ἐλεάζαρ ὁ ἱερεὺς
καὶ πάντες οἱ ἄρχοντες τῆς συναγωγῆς εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτοῖς
14 ἔξω τῆς παρεμβολῆς. Καὶ ὠργίσθη Μωυσῆς ἐπὶ τοῖς ἐπισκόποις
τῆς δυνάμεως, χιλιάρχοις καὶ ἑκατοντάρχοις, τοῖς ἐρχομένοις ἐκ
15 τῆς παρατάξεως τοῦ πολέμου. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς Μωυσῆς· Ἰνατί
16 ἐζωγρήσατε πᾶν θῆλυ; αὗται γὰρ ἦσαν τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ, κατὰ τὸ
ῥῆμα Βαλαάμ, τοῦ ἀποστῆσαι καὶ ὑπεριδεῖν τὸ ῥῆμα Κυρίου ἔνε-
17 κεν Φογώρ, καὶ ἐγένετο ἡ πληγὴ ἐν τῇ συναγωγῇ Κυρίου. Καὶ
νῦν ἀποκτείνατε πᾶν ἀρσενικὸν ἐν πάσῃ τῇ ἀπαρτίᾳ, καὶ πᾶσαν
18 γυναῖκα, ἥτις ἔγνω ἄνδρα εἰς κοίτην ἄρσενος, ἀποκτενεῖτε· καὶ
πᾶσαν τὴν ἀπαρτίαν τῶν γυναικῶν, ἥτις οὐκ ἔγνω κοίτην ἄρσε-
19 νος, ζωγρήσατε αὐτάς. Καὶ ὑμεῖς παρεμβαλεῖτε ἔξω τῆς παρεμ-
βολῆς ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας· πᾶς δ᾽ ἀνελὼν ψυχήν, καὶ πᾶς δ᾽ ἁπτόμενος
τοῦ τετρωμένου ἁγνισθήσεται τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τρίτῃ καὶ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ
20 ἑβδόμῃ, ὑμεῖς καὶ ἡ αἰχμαλωσία ὑμῶν· καὶ πᾶν περίβλημα, καὶ
πᾶν σκεῦος δερμάτινον, καὶ πᾶσαν ἐργασίαν ἐξ αἰγείας, καὶ
21 πᾶν σκεῦος ξύλινον ἀρχηγεῖτε. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἐλεάζαρ ὁ ἱερεὺς πρὸς
τοὺς ἄνδρας τῆς δυνάμεως, τοὺς ἐρχομένους ἐκ τῆς παρατάξεως
τοῦ πολέμου· τοῦτο τὸ δικαίωμα τοῦ νόμου, ὃ συνέταξε Κύριος
22 τῷ Μωυσῆ· πλὴν τοῦ ἀργυρίου, καὶ τοῦ χρυσίου, καὶ χαλκοῦ, καὶ σι-
23 δήρου, καὶ μολίβου, καὶ κασσιτέρου, πᾶν πρᾶγμα δ᾽ διελεύσεται ἐν πυρί,
διάξετε ἐν πυρὶ καὶ καθαρισθήσεται, ἀλλ᾽ ἦ τῷ ὕδατι τοῦ ἁγνισμοῦ
ἁγνισθήσεται· καὶ πάντα ὅσα μὴ διαπορεύεται διὰ πυρός, (οὐ) διελεύ-
24 σεται δι᾽ ὕδατος. Καὶ πλυνεῖσθε τὰ ἱμάτια ὑμῶν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβ-
δόμῃ, καὶ καθαρισθήσεσθε· καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα εἰσελεύσεσθε εἰς τὴν πα-
25 ρεμβολήν. Καὶ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, λέγων· 26 λάβε τὸ κε-
φάλαιον τῶν σκύλων τῆς αἰχμαλωσίας ἀπὸ ἀνθρώπου ἕως κτή-
νους, σὺ καὶ Ἐλεάζαρ ὁ ἱερεὺς καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες τῶν πατριῶν τῆς
27 συναγωγῆς, καὶ διέλειτε τὰ σκῦλα ἀνάμεσον τῶν πολεμιστῶν τῶν
ἐκπορευομένων εἰς τὴν παράταξιν, καὶ ἀνάμεσον πάσης τῆς συνα-

**NUMBERS, CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE**

...their dwellings, and all their encampments did they burn with fire.
11 And they took all their spoil, and all their booty, from man even unto
12 beast; and they brought them unto Moses, and unto Eleazar the priest, and unto all the sons of Israel: the captives, and the booty, and the spoil, into the camp in Araboth-Moab, which is by the Jordan, opposite Jericho.
13 And Moses went forth, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, to meet them outside the camp.
14 And Moses was wroth with the overseers of the force, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, who came from the array of the battle.
15 And Moses said unto them, “Wherefore have ye saved alive every female?
16 For these were they that did cause the sons of Israel, by the word of Balaam, to turn away and to despise the word of the Lord, on account of Peor; and so the plague befell the congregation of the Lord.
17 Now, therefore, slay every male child in all the company; and every woman that hath known a man to lie with a male, ye shall kill.
18 But every company of the women, which hath not known the lying with a male, save alive for yourselves.
19 And ye yourselves shall encamp outside the camp for seven days. And whosoever hath slain a soul, and whosoever hath touched one wounded, shall purify himself on the third day and on the seventh day; ye yourselves, and your captives.
20 And every garment, and every vessel of skin, and every work made of goat['s hair or skin], and every wooden vessel, ye shall consecrate.”
21 And Eleazar the priest spake unto the men of the force, who came from the array of the battle, saying, “This is the ordinance of the Law, which the Lord hath enjoined upon Moses:
22 Save the silver, and the gold, and the bronze, and the iron, and the lead, and the tin:
23 Every thing that shall pass through fire, ye shall make go through fire, and it shall be cleansed; but verily, by the water of purification shall it be purified. And all that doth not pass through fire, (not) it shall pass through water.
24 And ye shall wash your garments on the seventh day, and ye shall be cleansed; and after these things, ye shall come into the camp.”
25 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
26 “Take the sum of the booty of the captives, from man even unto beast: thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the chiefs of the tribes of the congregation.
27 And divide the booty among the men of war that went forth to the battle, and among all the congregation.”
