ΚΕΦ. ΛΑ΄. XXXI.

1 ἬΚΟΥΣΕ δὲ Ἰακὼβ τὰ ῥήματα τῶν υἱῶν Λάβαν, λεγόντων·
    εἴληφεν Ἰακὼβ πάντα τὰ τοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν, καὶ ἐκ τῶν τοῦ πα-
2 τρὸς ἡμῶν πεποίηκε πᾶσαν τὴν δόξαν ταύτην. Καὶ εἶδεν Ἰακὼβ
    τὸ πρόσωπον Λάβαν, καὶ ἰδοὺ οὐκ ἦν πρὸς αὐτὸν ὡς ἐχθὲς καὶ
3 τρίτην ἡμέραν. Εἶπε δὲ Κύριος πρὸς Ἰακώβ· ἀποστρέφου εἰς τὴν
    γῆν τοῦ πατρός σου καὶ εἰς τὴν γενεάν σου, καὶ ἔσομαι μετὰ σοῦ.
4 Ἀποστείλας δὲ Ἰακώβ, ἐκάλεσε Ῥαχὴλ καὶ Λείαν εἰς τὸ πεδίον
5 οὗ τὰ ποίμνια. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐταῖς· ὁρῶ ἐγὼ τὸ πρόσωπον τοῦ πα-
    τρός ὑμῶν, ὅτι οὐκ ἐστὶ μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ ὡς ἐχθὲς καὶ τρίτην ἡμέραν·
6 ὁ δὲ Θεὸς τοῦ πατρός μου ἦν μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ. Καὶ αὐταὶ δὲ οἴδατε,
7 ὅτι ἐν πάσῃ ἰσχύϊ μου δεδούλευκα τῷ πατρὶ ὑμῶν· ὁ δὲ πατὴρ
    ὑμῶν παρεκρούσατό με, καὶ ἤλλαξε τὸν μισθόν μου τῶν δέκα
8 μνῶν· καὶ οὐκ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ ὁ Θεὸς κακοποιῆσαί με. Ἐὰν οὕτως
    εἴπῃ· τὰ ποικίλα ἔσται σου μισθός· καὶ τέξεται πάντα τὰ πρό-
    βατα ποικίλα. Ἐὰν δὲ εἴπῃ· τὰ λευκὰ ἔσται σου μισθός· καὶ τέ-
9 ξεται πάντα τὰ πρόβατα λευκά. Καὶ ἀφείλατο ὁ Θεὸς πάντα τὰ
10 κτήνη τοῦ πατρὸς ὑμῶν, καὶ ἔδωκέ μοι αὐτά. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἡνί-
    κα ἐνεκίσσων τὰ πρόβατα, καὶ ἰδὼν ἐν τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς μου ἐν τῷ
    ὕπνῳ, καὶ ἰδοὺ οἱ τράγοι καὶ οἱ κριοὶ ἀναβαίνοντες ἦσαν ἐπὶ τὰ
    πρόβατα καὶ τὰς αἶγας διαλεύκους, καὶ ποικίλοι καὶ σποδοειδεῖς
11 ῥαντοί. Καὶ εἶπέ μοι ὁ ἄγγελος τοῦ Θεοῦ καθ᾿ ὕπνον· Ἰακώβ,
12 Ἰακώβ. Ἐγὼ δὲ εἶπα· τί ἐστι; Καὶ εἶπεν· ἀνάβλεψον τοῖς ὀφθαλ-
    μοῖς, καὶ ἴδε τοὺς τράγους καὶ τοὺς κριοὺς ἀναβαίνοντας ἐπὶ τὰ
    πρόβατα καὶ τὰς αἶγας διαλεύκους καὶ ποικίλους καὶ σποδοειδεῖς
13 ῥαντούς· ἑώρακα γὰρ πάντα ὅσα σοι Λάβαν ποιεῖ. Ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ
    Θεὸς ὁ ὀφθείς σοι· ἐν τῷ τόπῳ Θεοῦ, οὗ ἠλείψας μοι ἐκεῖ στή-
    λην, καὶ ηὔξω μοι ἐκεῖ εὐχήν· νῦν οὖν ἀνάστηθι, καὶ ἔξελθε ἐκ
    τῆς γῆς ταύτης, καὶ ἀπελθε εἰς τὴν γῆν τῆς γενέσεώς σου, καὶ
14 ἔσομαι μετὰ σοῦ. Καὶ ἀποκριθεῖσα Ῥαχὴλ καὶ Λεία, εἶπαν αὐτῷ·
    μὴ ἔστιν ἡμῖν ἔτι μερὶς ἢ κληρονομία ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ πατρὸς
15 ἡμῶν; οὐχ ὡς αἱ ἀλλότριαι λελογίσμεθα αὐτῷ; πέπρακε γὰρ ἡ-
16 μᾶς, καὶ κατέφαγε καταβρώσει τὸ ἀργύριον ἡμῶν. Πάντα τὸν
    πλοῦτον, καὶ τὴν δόξαν, ἣν ἀφείλατο ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν,

### Genesis 31

1 And Jacob heard the words of Laban’s sons, who spoke, saying: “Jacob has taken all that belonged to our father; and of that which was our father’s, he has acquired all this glory.”
2 And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and lo, it was not toward him as yesterday and the day before.
3 Then the Lord said unto Jacob, “Return unto the land of your fathers and to your kindred; and I shall be with you.”
4 And Jacob sent forth [messengers], and called Rachel and Leah unto the field where his flocks were.
5 And he said unto them, “I perceive your father’s countenance, that it is not toward me as yesterday and the day before;
6 but the God of my father has been with me. And you yourselves do know
7 that with all my might I have served as a bondservant unto your father; and your father has defrauded me, and he changed my wages of ten minas;
8 yet God did not suffer him to do me evil. If he should say thus: ‘The speckled ones shall be your wages,’ then all the sheep brought forth speckled [offspring]. And if he should say: ‘The white ones shall be your wages,’ then all the sheep brought forth white [offspring].
9 So God took away all the livestock of your father, and gave them unto me.
10 And it came to pass, when the sheep were in heat, that I, looking with mine eyes in a dream, behold, the he-goats and the rams that went up upon the sheep and the she-goats were distinctly white, and speckled, and ash-colored, dappled.
11 And the Angel of God said unto me in a dream, ‘Jacob, Jacob!’ And I said, ‘What is it?’
12 And He said, ‘Lift up your eyes, and behold the he-goats and the rams that go up upon the sheep and the she-goats, distinctly white, and speckled, and ash-colored, dappled; for I have seen all that Laban does unto you.
13 I am the God Who appeared unto you in the place of God, where you anointed a pillar unto Me, and made a vow unto Me there. Now therefore, arise, and go forth from this land, and depart unto the land of your nativity; and I shall be with you.’
14 Then Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, “Is there yet for us any portion or inheritance in our father’s house?
15 Are we not reckoned unto him as strangers? For he sold us, and has utterly consumed our silver.
16 All the riches and the glory, which God has taken from our father,"
