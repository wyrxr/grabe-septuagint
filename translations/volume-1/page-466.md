**33** Καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ Ἀροὴρ καὶ ἕως τοῦ ἐλθεῖν σε εἰς Μωειθ εἴκοσι πόλεις, ἕως Ἀβὴλ ἀμπελώνων, πληγὴν μεγάλην σφόδρα· καὶ ἐνετράπησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἀμμὼν ἀπὸ προσώπου υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ.
**34** Καὶ εἰσῆλθεν Ἰεφθάε εἰς Μασσηφὰ εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἰδοὺ ἡ θυγάτηρ αὐτοῦ ἐξεπορεύετο εἰς ἀπάντησιν αὐτοῦ ἐν τυμπάνοις καὶ χοροῖς· καὶ αὕτη μονογενὴς αὐτῷ ἀγαπητή, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν αὐτῷ πλὴν αὐτῆς υἱὸς ἢ θυγάτηρ.
**35** Καὶ ἐγενήθη ἡνίκα εἶδεν αὐτήν, καὶ διέρρηξε τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπεν· οἴμοι θυγάτερ μου, ἐμπεποδοστάτηκάς με καὶ σεμνοτάτη, εἰς σκῶλον ἐγένου ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς μου· ἐγὼ δὲ ἤνοιξα τὸ στόμα μου περὶ σοῦ πρὸς Κύριον, καὶ οὐ δυνήσομαι ἀποστρέψαι.
**36** Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτόν· πάτερ μου, εἰ ἐν ἐμοὶ ἤνοιξας τὸ στόμα σου πρὸς Κύριον, ποίει μοι ὃν τρόπον ἐξῆλθεν ἐκ στόματος σου, ἀφ᾿ ὧν ἐποίησέ σοι Κύριος ἐκδικήσεις ἐκ τῶν ἐχθρῶν σου ἐκ τῶν υἱῶν Ἀμμών.
**37** Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς τὸν πατέρα αὐτῆς· καὶ ποίησόν μοι τὸ ρῆμα τοῦτο· ἔασόν με δύο μῆνας, καὶ πορεύσομαι καὶ καταβήσομαι ἐπὶ τὰ ὄρη, καὶ κλαύσομαι ἐπὶ τὰ παρθένιά μου, καὶ ἐγὼ καὶ αἱ συνεταῖριδές μου.
**38** Καὶ εἶπε· πορεύου· καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν αὐτὴν δύο μῆνας. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη αὕτη καὶ αἱ συνεταῖριδές αὐτῆς, καὶ ἔκλαυσεν ἐπὶ τὰ παρθένια αὐτῆς ἐπὶ τὰ ὄρη.
**39** Καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ τέλος δύο μηνῶν, καὶ ἀνέκαμψε πρὸς τὸν πατέρα αὐτῆς· καὶ ἐπετέλεσεν Ἰεφθάε ἐν αὐτῇ τὴν εὐχὴν αὐτοῦ ἣν ηὔξατο· καὶ αὐτὴ οὐκ ἔγνω ἄνδρα.
**40** Καὶ ἐγεννήθη εἰς πρόσταγμα ἐν Ἰσραήλ· ἐξ ἡμερῶν εἰς ἡμέρας συνεπορεύοντο αἱ θυγατέρες Ἰσραήλ, θρηνεῖν τὴν θυγατέρα Ἰεφθάε τοῦ Γαλααδίτου τέσσαρας ἡμέρας ἐν τῷ ἐνιαυτῷ.

**1** ΚΑΙ συνήχθησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἐφραίμ, καὶ ἦλθον εἰς Σεφεινά, καὶ εἶπον πρὸς Ἰεφθάε· τί ὅτι ἐπορεύθης πολεμεῖν, ἐν τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἀμμὼν, καὶ ἡμᾶς οὐ κέκληκας πορευθῆναι μετὰ σοῦ; τὸν οἶκόν σου ἐμπρήσομεν ἐν πυρί.
**2** Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτοὺς Ἰεφθάε· ἀνὴρ ἀντιδικῶν ἤμην ἐγὼ καὶ ὁ λαός μου, καὶ υἱοὶ Ἀμμὼν ἐταπείνουν με σφόδρα· καὶ ἐδέησα πρὸς ὑμᾶς, καὶ οὐκ ἐσώσατέ με ἐκ χειρὸς αὐτῶν.
**3** Καὶ ἰδὼν ὅτι οὐκ ἦν ὁ σώζων, καὶ ἐθέμην τὴν ψυχήν μου ἐν τῇ χειρί μου, καὶ διέβην πρὸς τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἀμμὼν, καὶ παρέδωκεν αὐτοὺς Κύριος ἐνώπιόν μου· καὶ ἵνατί ἀνέβητε πρός με τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ταύτῃ, τοῦ πο-

### Judges Chapter 11

**33.** And he smote them from Aroer, even until thy coming unto Moeith, twenty cities, unto Abel of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter; and the children of Ammon were confounded before the children of Israel.
**34.** And Jephthah came into Massepha unto his house; and, behold, his daughter came forth to meet him with timbrels and with dances; and she was his only beloved [child], and he had none other beside her, neither son nor daughter.
**35.** And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his garments, and said, "Alas, my daughter! Thou hast utterly cast me down, and art most precious [to me], for thou art become a stumbling block in mine eyes; for I have opened my mouth concerning thee unto the Lord, and I cannot turn back."
**36.** And she said unto him, "My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the Lord concerning me, do unto me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth, inasmuch as the Lord hath wrought vengeance for thee upon thine enemies, even upon the children of Ammon."
**37.** And she said unto her father, "Grant me this one thing: Let me alone for two months, that I may go and descend upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my companions."
**38.** And he said, "Go." And he sent her away for two months. And she departed, she and her companions, and wept for her virginity upon the mountains.
**39.** And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father; and Jephthah fulfilled in her his vow which he had vowed; and she knew no man.
**40.** And it became an ordinance in Israel, that from year to year the daughters of Israel went together, to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in the year.

### Judges Chapter 12

**1.** And the children of Ephraim were gathered together, and went to Sepeina, and said unto Jephthah, "Wherefore wentest thou to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee? We will burn thine house upon thee with fire."
**2.** And Jephthah said unto them, "A man of strife was I and my people, and the children of Ammon oppressed me grievously; and I besought you, but ye delivered me not out of their hand."
**3.** And when I saw that there was no deliverer, then I put my life in my hand, and passed over unto the children of Ammon, and the Lord delivered them before me; and wherefore are ye come up against me this day, of the po-
