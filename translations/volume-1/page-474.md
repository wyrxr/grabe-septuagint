**ΚΕΦ. ΙϚ´.**
εἰς τὸν τοῖχον, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτόν· οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι ἐπὶ σὲ Σαμψών.
Καὶ ἠγέρθη ἐκ τοῦ ὕπνου αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐξέσπασε τοὺς πασσάλους σὺν τῷ
ὑφάσματι ἐκ τοῦ τοίχου, καὶ τὸ διάσμα· καὶ οὐκ ἐγνώσθη ἡ ἰσχὺς
αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτὸν Δαλιδά· πῶς ἐρεῖς, ἠγάπηκά σε, καὶ 15
ἡ καρδία σου οὐκ ἔστι μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ; τοῦτο τὸ τρίτον παρελογίσω με,
καὶ οὐκ ἀπήγγειλάς μοι, ἐν τίνι ἡ ἰσχύς σου ἡ μεγάλη. Καὶ ἐγένετο 16
ὅτε κατειργάσατο αὐτὸν τοῖς λόγοις αὐτῆς ὅλην τὴν νύκτα,
καὶ παρηνώχλησεν αὐτόν, καὶ ὀλιγοψύχησεν (ἕως) εἰς θάνατον· καὶ 17
ἀπήγγειλεν αὐτῇ πάντα τὰ ἀπὸ καρδίας αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ·
Ξυρὸν οὐκ ἀναβήσεται ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλήν μου, ἔτι Ναζειραῖος Θεοῦ
ἐγώ εἰμι ἐκ κοιλίας μητρός μου· καὶ ἐὰν ξυρήσωμαι, ἀποστήσεται
ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ ἡ ἰσχύς μου, καὶ ἀσθενήσω, καὶ ἔσομαι κατὰ πάντας
τοὺς ἀνθρώπους. Καὶ ἴδε Δαλιδά, ὅτι ἀπήγγειλε πάντα τὰ ἀπὸ 18
καρδίας αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀπέστειλε, καὶ ἐκάλεσε πάντας τοὺς σατράπας
τῶν ἀλλοφύλων, λέγουσα· ἀνάβητε τὸ ἅπαξ, ὅτι ἀπήγγειλέ μοι
πᾶσαν τὴν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἀνέβησαν πρὸς αὐτὴν πᾶσαι αἱ
σατραπίαι τῶν ἀλλοφύλων, καὶ ἤνεγκαν τὸ ἀργύριον ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν
αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐκοίμισεν αὐτὸν ἀναμέσον τῶν γονάτων αὐτῆς, καὶ 19
ἐκάλεσε τὸν κουρέα, καὶ ἐξύρησε τοὺς ἑπτὰ βοστρύχους τῆς κεφαλῆς
αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἤρξατο ταπεινοῦσθαι, καὶ ἀπέστη ἡ ἰσχὺς αὐτοῦ ἀπ᾿
αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Δαλιδά· οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι ἐπὶ σὲ Σαμψών. 20
Καὶ ἐξηγέρθη ἐκ τοῦ ὕπνου αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπεν· ἐξελεύσομαι καὶ
ποιήσω καθὼς ἀεί, καὶ ἀποτινάξομαι· καὶ αὐτὸς οὐκ ἔγνω ὅτι Κύριος
ἀπέστη ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐπελάβοντο αὐτοῦ οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι, καὶ 21
ἐξώρυξαν τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ, καὶ κατήγαγον αὐτὸν εἰς Γάζαν,
καὶ ἔδησαν αὐτὸν ἐν πέδαις χαλκαῖς· καὶ ἦν ἀλήθων ἐν οἴκῳ τῆς
φυλακῆς. Καὶ ἤρξατο ἡ θρὶξ τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ ἀνατεῖλαι, ἡνίκα 22
ἐξυρήθη. Καὶ οἱ σατράπαι τῶν ἀλλοφύλων συνήχθησαν τοῦ θῦσαι 23
θυσίαν μεγάλην Δαγὼν τῷ θεῷ αὐτῶν, καὶ τοῦ εὐφρανθῆναι, καὶ
εἶπαν· παρέδωκεν ὁ θεὸς ἡμῶν ἐν χειρὶ ἡμῶν Σαμψὼν τὸν ἐχθρὸν
ἡμῶν. Καὶ ἴδον αὐτὸν ὁ λαός, καὶ ἤνεσαν τοὺς θεοὺς αὐτῶν, καὶ 24
εἶπαν· παρέδωκεν ὁ θεὸς ἡμῶν τὸν ἐχθρὸν ἡμῶν ἐν χειρὶ ἡμῶν,
καὶ τὸν ἐξερημοῦντα τὴν γῆν ἡμῶν, ὅστις ἐπλήθυνε τοὺς τραυματίας
ἡμῶν. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὅτε ἠγαθύνθη ἡ καρδία αὐτῶν, καὶ εἶπαν· κα- 25
λέσατε τὸν Σαμψὼν ἐξ οἴκου φυλακῆς, καὶ παιξάτω ἐνώπιον ἡμῶν.
Καὶ ἐκάλεσαν τὸν Σαμψὼν ἐξ οἴκου τῆς φυλακῆς, καὶ ἐνέπαιζον

### Judges Chapter 16

**14.** ...into the wall. And she said unto him, "The Philistines are upon thee, Samson!" And he awoke from his sleep, and plucked out the pegs with the fabric from the wall, and the warp [too]; yet his strength was not known.

**15.** Then Delilah said unto him, "How canst thou say, 'I love thee,' when thy heart is not with me? This is now the third time thou hast deceived me, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth."

**16.** And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and vexed him, so that his soul was wearied [even] unto death;

**17.** That he told her all [that was] from his heart, and said unto her, "A razor hath not come upon my head; for a Nazirite of God I have been from my mother's womb. If I be shaven, then my strength will depart from me, and I shall become weak, and be as any other man."

**18.** And Delilah saw that he had told her all [that was] from his heart; and she sent and called for all the lords of the Philistines, saying, "Come up this once, for he hath now told me all his heart." Then all the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and they brought the silver in their hands.

**19.** And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a barber, and he shaved off the seven locks of his head. And he began to be weakened, for his strength was departed from him.

**20.** And Delilah said unto him, "The Philistines are upon thee, Samson!" And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, "I will go out as at other times, and shake myself free." But he knew not that the Lord was departed from him.

**21.** Then the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of bronze; and he did grind in the prison house.

**22.** Howbeit, the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven.

**23.** Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and for to rejoice; for they said, "Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand."

**24.** And when the people saw him, they praised their gods, and said, "Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, even the destroyer of our land, who hath multiplied our slain."

**25.** And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, "Call for Samson out of the prison house, that he may make sport for us." And they called Samson out of the prison house; and he made sport [for them].
