52 ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ ΚΕΦ. Λ´.
13 εἶπε Λεία· μακαρία ἐγώ, ὅτι μακαρίζουσί με (πᾶσαι) αἱ γυναῖκες·
14 καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ, Ἀσήρ. Ἐπορεύθη δὲ Ῥουβὴν ἐν ἡμέραις θερισμοῦ πυρῶν, καὶ εὗρε μῆλα μανδραγορῶν ἐν τῷ ἀγρῷ,
καὶ ἤνεγκεν αὐτὰ πρὸς Λείαν τὴν μητέρα αὐτοῦ. Εἶπε δὲ Ῥαχήλ
15 τῇ Λείᾳ· δός μοι τῶν μανδραγορῶν τοῦ υἱοῦ σου. Εἶπε δὲ Λεία·
οὐχ ἱκανόν σοι, ὅτι ἔλαβες τὸν ἄνδρα μου; μὴ καὶ τοὺς μανδραγόρας τοῦ υἱοῦ μου λήψῃ; Εἶπε δὲ Ῥαχήλ· οὐχ οὕτως· κοιμηθήτω μετὰ σοῦ τὴν νύκτα ταύτην ἀντὶ τῶν μανδραγορῶν τοῦ υἱοῦ
16 σου. Εἰσῆλθε δὲ Ἰακὼβ ἐξ ἀγροῦ ἑσπέρας· καὶ ἐξῆλθε Λεία εἰς
συνάντησιν αὐτῷ καὶ εἶπε· πρὸς ἐμὲ εἰσελεύσῃ σήμερον, μεμίσθωμαι γὰρ σε ἀντὶ τῶν μανδραγορῶν τοῦ υἱοῦ μου. Καὶ ἐκοιμήθη
17 μετ᾿ αὐτῆς τὴν νύκτα ἐκείνην. Καὶ ἐπήκουσεν αὐτῆς ὁ Θεός, καὶ
18 συλλαβοῦσα ἔτεκε τῷ Ἰακὼβ υἱὸν πέμπτον. Καὶ εἶπε Λεία· δέδωκέ (μοι) ὁ Θεός τὸν μισθόν μου, ἀνθ᾿ ὧν ἔδωκα τὴν παιδίσκην μου τῷ ἀνδρί μου· καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ, Ἰσσάχαρ, ὅ ἐστι μισθός.
19 Καὶ συνέλαβεν ἔτι Λεία, καὶ ἔτεκεν υἱὸν
20 ἕκτον τῷ Ἰακώβ. Καὶ εἶπε Λεία· δεδώρηται ὁ Θεός μοι δῶρον
καλόν· ἐν τῷ νῦν καιρῷ αἱρετίει με ὁ ἀνήρ μου, τέτοκα γὰρ
21 αὐτῷ υἱοὺς ἕξ· καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ, Ζαβουλών. Καὶ
μετὰ τοῦτο ἔτεκε θυγατέρα, καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτῆς, Δείνα·
22 (καὶ ἔστη τοῦ τίκτειν). Ἐμνήσθη δὲ ὁ Θεὸς Ῥαχήλ, καὶ
23 ἐπήκουσεν αὐτῆς ὁ Θεός, καὶ ἀνέῳξεν αὐτῆς τὴν μήτραν· καὶ
συλλαβοῦσα, ἔτεκε τῷ Ἰακὼβ υἱόν. Εἶπε δὲ Ῥαχήλ· ἀφεῖλεν ὁ
24 Θεός μου τὸ ὄνειδος. Καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ἰωσήφ, λέγουσα·
25 προσθέτω ὁ Θεός μοι υἱὸν ἕτερον. Ἐγένετο δὲ ὡς ἔτεκε
Ῥαχήλ τὸν Ἰωσήφ, εἶπεν Ἰακὼβ τῷ Λάβαν· ἀπόστειλόν με, ἵνα
26 ἀπέλθω εἰς τὸν τόπον μου καὶ εἰς τὴν γῆν μου· ἀπόδος μοι
τὰς γυναῖκάς μου, καὶ τὰ παιδία μου, περὶ ὧν δεδούλευκά σοι,
ἵνα ἀπέλθω· σὺ γὰρ γινώσκεις τὴν δουλείαν, ἣν δεδούλευκά σοι.
27 Εἶπε δὲ αὐτῷ Λάβαν· εἰ εὗρον χάριν ἐναντίον σου, οἰωνισάμην
ἄν· εὐλόγησε γάρ με ὁ Θεὸς ἐν τῇ σῇ εἰσόδῳ. Καὶ εἶπε· διάστειλον
28 τὸν μισθόν σου πρός με, καὶ δώσω σοι. Εἶπε δὲ
29 αὐτῷ Ἰακώβ· σὺ γινώσκεις ἃ δεδούλευκά σοι, καὶ ὅσα ἦν κτήνη
30 σου μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ. Μικρὰ γὰρ ἦν ὅσα ἦν σοι ἐναντίον μου, καὶ
ηὐξήθη εἰς πλῆθος, καὶ ηὐλόγησέ σε Κύριος ἐπὶ τῷ ποδί μου·
31 νῦν οὖν πότε ποιήσω κἀγὼ ἐμαυτῷ οἶκον; Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Λάβαν·

### Genesis 30

¹³ Then Leah said, Happy am I, for (all) women shall call me blessed. And she called his name Asher.
¹⁴ And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrake apples in the field, and brought them unto Leah his mother. Then Rachel said unto Leah,
¹⁵ Give me, I pray thee, of thy son’s mandrake apples. And Leah said, Is it not enough for thee that thou hast taken my husband? And wilt thou take my son’s mandrake apples also? And Rachel said, Not so; let him lie with thee this night, for thy son’s mandrake apples.
¹⁶ And Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou shalt come in unto me this day, for I have surely hired thee with my son’s mandrake apples. And he lay with her that night.
¹⁷ And God hearkened unto her, and she conceived, and bare Jacob a fifth son.
¹⁸ Then Leah said, God hath given (me) my reward, because I have given my handmaiden to my husband. And she called his name Issachar, which is, Reward.
¹⁹ And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob a sixth son.
²⁰ And Leah said, God hath bestowed upon me a good gift; now will my husband honor me, for I have borne him six sons. And she called his name Zebulun.
²¹ And after this she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah; (and she ceased from bearing).
²² Then God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened unto her, and opened her womb.
²³ And she conceived, and bare Jacob a son. And Rachel said, God hath taken away my reproach.
²⁴ And she called his name Joseph, saying, May God add to me another son.
²⁵ And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto my own place, and to my own country.
²⁶ Restore unto me my wives, and my children, for whom I have served thee, that I may depart; for thou knowest the service wherewith I have served thee.
²⁷ Then Laban said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, [I would have] divined [it]; for God hath blessed me at thy coming.
²⁸ And he said, Appoint thy wages for me, and I will give [them] to thee.
²⁹ And Jacob said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle hath been with me.
³⁰ For little was that which thou hadst before me, and it hath increased unto a multitude; and the Lord hath blessed thee upon my steps. Now therefore, when shall I also make for myself a house?
³¹ And Laban said unto him,
