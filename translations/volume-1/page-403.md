ποίησας τῇ Ἱεριχὼ καὶ τῷ βασιλεῖ αὐτῆς· καὶ τὴν προνομὴν
αὐτῆς καὶ τῶν κτηνῶν αὐτῆς προνομεύσεις σεαυτῷ· κατάστησον
(δὲ) σεαυτῷ ἔνεδρα τῇ πόλει εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω αὐτῆς.
3 Καὶ ἀνέστη Ἰησοῦς καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ὁ πολεμιστής, ὥστε ἀναβῆναι εἰς Γαΐ·
καὶ ἐπέλεξεν Ἰησοῦς τριάκοντα χιλιάδας ἀνδρῶν δυνατοὺς ἐν ἰσ-
4 χύϊ, καὶ ἀπέστειλεν αὐτοὺς νυκτός. Καὶ ἐνετείλατο αὐτοῖς, λέ-
γων Ἴδετε, ὑμεῖς ἐνεδρεύσατε τὴν πόλιν ὀπίσω τῆς πόλεως· μὴ
μακρὰν γίνεσθε ἀπὸ τῆς πόλεως σφόδρα, καὶ ἔσεσθε πάντες ἕτοι-
μοι.
5 Καὶ ἐγὼ καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ὁ μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ, προσάξομεν πρὸς
τὴν πόλιν· καὶ ἔσται ὡς ἂν ἐξέλθωσιν οἱ κατοικοῦντες Γαΐ εἰς
συνάντησιν ἡμῖν, καθάπερ καὶ πρώην, καὶ φευξόμεθα ἀπὸ προσώ-
που αὐτῶν. Καὶ ὡς ἂν ἐξέλθωσιν ὀπίσω ἡμῶν, ἀποστήσομεν αὐ-
τοὺς ἀπὸ τῆς πόλεως· καὶ ἔσται φεύγουσιν οὗτοι ἀπὸ προσώπου
ἡμῶν, ὃν τρόπον καὶ ἔμπροσθεν· καὶ φευξόμεθα ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐ-
τῶν.
7 Ὑμεῖς δὲ ἐξαναστήσεσθε ἐκ τῆς ἐνέδρας, καὶ πορεύσεσθε εἰς
τὴν πόλιν, καὶ ἐκτρίψετε τὴν πόλιν· καὶ δώσει αὐτὴν Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς
ὑμῶν εἰς τὰς χεῖρας ὑμῶν.
8 Ἔσται δὲ ὡς ἂν συλλάβητε τὴν πόλιν,
9 ἐμπρήσατε αὐτὴν ἐν πυρί. Κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο ποιήσετε· Ἰδοὺ
ἐντέταλμαι ὑμῖν. Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν αὐτοὺς Ἰησοῦς, καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν
εἰς τὴν ἔνεδραν· καὶ ἐνεκάθισαν ἀναμέσον Βαιθήλ καὶ ἀναμέσον
Γαΐ, ἀπὸ θαλάσσης τῆς Γαΐ· καὶ ἡλίσθη Ἰησοῦς τὴν νύκτα ἐ-
10 κείνην ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ λαοῦ. Καὶ ὀρθρίσας Ἰησοῦς τὸ πρωΐ, ἐπε-
σκέψατο τὸν λαόν· καὶ ἀνέβησαν αὐτὸς καὶ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι Ἰσ-
11 ραὴλ κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ λαοῦ ἐπὶ Γαΐ. Καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ὁ πο-
λεμιστὴς ὁ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, ἀνέβησαν, καὶ πορευόμενοι ἦλθον ἐξ ἐναντίας
τῆς πόλεως ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν, καὶ τὰ ἔνεδρα τῆς πόλεως ἀπὸ θαλάσ-
σης καὶ παρενέβαλον ἀπὸ βορρᾶ τῆς Γαΐ, καὶ ἡ κοιλὰς ἀναμέσον
12 αὐτοῦ καὶ τῆς Γαΐ. Καὶ ἔλαβεν ὡς πέντε χιλιάδας ἀνδρῶν, καὶ
ἔθετο αὐτοὺς ἔνεδρα ἀναμέσον τῆς Βαιθήλ καὶ τῆς Γαΐ, θαλάσ-
13 σαν τῆς Γαΐ. Καὶ ἔθηκεν ὁ λαὸς πᾶσαν τὴν παρεμβολήν, ἣ ἦν
ἀπὸ βορρᾶ τῇ πόλει, καὶ τὰ ἔσχατα αὐτοῦ θάλασσαν τῆς πόλεως·
καὶ ἐπορεύθη Ἰησοῦς τὴν νύκτα ἐκείνην ἐν μέσῳ τῆς κοιλάδος.
14 Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἴδεν ὁ βασιλεὺς τῆς Γαΐ, ἔσπευσε καὶ ὤρθρισε,
καὶ ἐξῆλθον οἱ ἄνδρες τῆς πόλεως εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτοῖς ἐπ᾿ εὐ-
θείας εἰς τὸν πόλεμον, αὐτὸς καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸν καιρόν
κατὰ πρόσωπον τῆς Ἄραβα· καὶ αὐτὸς οὐκ ᾔδει, ὅτι ἔνεδρα

**Joshua 8**
2 ...as thou didst unto Jericho and unto her king. Her spoil and her cattle shalt thou plunder for thyself; but set thee an ambush against the city, behind it.
3 And Joshua arose, and all the people, the men of war, to go up to Ai. And Joshua chose thirty thousand men, mighty in valor, and sent them forth by night.
4 And he commanded them, saying, "Behold, ye shall lay an ambush against the city, behind the city. Be ye not very far from the city, and be ye all ready.
5 And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the city. And it shall be, when the inhabitants of Ai come out to meet us, as also before, then will we flee from before their face. And when they come out after us, we shall draw them away from the city; and it shall be that these shall flee from before our face, in the manner that they did before; and we will flee from before their face.
7 But ye shall rise up from the ambush, and go into the city, and utterly destroy the city; for the Lord your God will deliver it into your hands.
8 And it shall be, when ye have taken the city,
9 ye shall burn it with fire. According to this word shall ye do; behold, I have commanded you." And Joshua sent them forth, and they went to the ambush; and they lay in wait between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai. And Joshua remained that night in the midst of the people.
10 And Joshua rose early in the morning, and reviewed the people. And he and the elders of Israel went up before the face of the people toward Ai.
11 And all the people, the men of war, who were with him, went up; and going, they came from the east opposite the city. And the ambushes of the city [were placed] from the west, and they encamped from the north of Ai; and the valley was between him and Ai.
12 And he took about five thousand men, and set them as an ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai.
13 And the people set all the camp, which was to the north of the city; and the rear of it [was] to the west of the city. And Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.
14 And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw [this], he hastened and rose early. And the men of the city went out to meet them directly for battle, he and all his people at the appointed time against the face of the Arabah; but he knew not that an ambush...
