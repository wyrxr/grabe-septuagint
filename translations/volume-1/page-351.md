ΚΕΦ. ΙΔʹ. XIV.

1    Υἱοὶ ἔστε Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ὑμῶν· οὐ φοιβήσεσθε, καὶ οὐκ ἐπιθή-
2    σετε φαλάκρωμα ἀναμέσον τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν ὑμῶν ἐπὶ νεκρῷ· ὅτι λαὸς
     ἅγιος εἶ Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ σου, καὶ σὲ ἐξελέξατο Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου γε-
     νέσθαι αὐτῷ λαὸν περιούσιον ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν ἐθνῶν τῶν ἐπὶ προ-
3    σώπου τῆς γῆς. Οὐ φάγεσθε πᾶν βδέλυγμα. 4 Ταῦτα τὰ κτήνη
     ἃ φάγεσθε· μόσχον ἐκ βοῶν, καὶ ἀμνὸν ἐκ προβάτων, καὶ χί-
5    μαρον ἐξ αἰγῶν· ἔλαφον, καὶ δορκάδα, καὶ βούβαλον, καὶ τρα-
6    γέλαφον, καὶ πύγαργον, καὶ ὄρυγα, καὶ καμηλοπάρδαλιν· καὶ πᾶν
     κτῆνος διχηλεῦον ὁπλὴν, καὶ ὀνυχιστῆρας ὀνυχῖζον δύο χηλῶν,
7    καὶ ἀνάγον μηρυκισμὸν ἐν τοῖς κτήνεσι, ταῦτα φάγεσθε. Καὶ ταῦ-
     τα οὐ φάγεσθε ἀπὸ τῶν ἀναγόντων μηρυκισμὸν, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν
     διχηλούντων τὰς ὁπλὰς, καὶ ὀνυχιζόντων ὀνυχιστῆρας· τὸν κά-
     μηλον, καὶ δασύποδα, καὶ χοιρογρύλλιον· ὅτι ἀνάγει μηρυκισμὸν
8    ταῦτα, καὶ ὁπλὴν οὐ διχηλοῦσιν, ἀκάθαρτα ὑμῖν ἐστι. Καὶ τὸν
     ὗν· ὅτι διχηλεῖ ὁπλὴν τοῦτο, καὶ ὀνυχίζει ὄνυχας ὁπλῆς, καὶ
     τοῦτο μηρυκισμὸν οὐκ ἀναμηρυκᾶται, ἀκάθαρτον τοῦτο ὑμῖν· ἀπὸ
     τῶν κρεῶν αὐτῶν οὐ φάγεσθε, καὶ τῶν θνησιμαίων αὐτῶν οὐχ
9    ἅψεσθε. Καὶ ταῦτα φάγεσθε ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν ἐν τοῖς ὕδασι· πάν-
10   τα ὅσα ἐστιν αὐτοῖς πτερύγια καὶ λεπίδες, (ταῦτα) φάγεσθε. Καὶ
     πάντα ὅσα οὐκ ἔστιν αὐτοῖς πτερύγια οὐδὲ λεπίδες, οὐ φάγεσθε·
11   ἀκάθαρτα ταῦτά ἐστιν ὑμῖν. Πᾶν ὄρνεον καθαρὸν φάγεσθε. 12 Καὶ
     ταῦτα ἃ οὐ φάγεσθε ἀπ᾽ αὐτῶν· τὸν ἀετὸν, καὶ τὸν γρύπα, καὶ
13   τὸν ἁλιαίετον, καὶ τὸν ἴξον, καὶ τὸν γύπα, καὶ τὸν ἰκτῖνα, καὶ
14   τὰ ὅμοια αὐτῷ· καὶ πάντα κόρακα, καὶ τὰ ὅμοια αὐτῷ· 15 καὶ
     στρουθὸν, καὶ γλαῦκα, καὶ λάρον, καὶ ἱέρακα, καὶ τὰ ὅμοια αὐτῷ·
16   καὶ ἐρωδιὸν, καὶ κύκνον, καὶ ἶβιν, 17 καὶ καταράκτην, (καὶ ὕποπα)
18   καὶ πορφυρίωνα, καὶ νυκτικόρακα, καὶ πελεκᾶνα, καὶ χαραδριὸν,
19   καὶ τὰ ὅμοια αὐτῷ, καὶ ἔποπα, καὶ νυκτερίδα. Πάντα τὰ ἑρπετὰ
     τῶν πετεινῶν ἀκάθαρτα ταῦτα ἔστιν ὑμῖν· οὐ φάγεσθε ἀπ᾽ αὐτῶν
20   πᾶν πετεινὸν καθαρὸν φάγεσθε. 21 Καὶ πᾶν θνησιμαῖον οὐ φάγεσθε·
     τῷ παροίκῳ τῷ ἐν ταῖς πόλεσί σου δοθήσεται, καὶ φάγεται αὐτὸ,
     ἢ ἀποδόσῃ τῷ ἀλλοτρίῳ· ὅτι λαὸς ἅγιος εἶ Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ σου·
22   Οὐχ ἑψήσεις ἄρνα ἐν γάλακτι μητρὸς αὐτοῦ.

**DEUTERONOMY**
**CHAPTER 14**

1 Ye are the sons of the Lord your God; ye shall not defile yourselves,
nor make baldness betwixt your eyes for the dead.
2 For thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God, and the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be for Himself a special people, above all the nations that are upon the face of the earth.

3 Ye shall eat no abominable thing.
4 These are the beasts which ye shall eat: the calf of the kine, and the lamb of the sheep, and the kid of the goats;
5 the hart, and the roebuck, and the buffalo, and the wild goat,
6 and the pygarg, and the antelope, and the giraffe; and every beast that parteth the hoof, and cleaveth the claws of two hoofs,
7 and bringeth up the cud among the beasts, these ye shall eat. And these ye shall not eat of those that bring up the cud, and of those that part the hoofs, and cleave the claws: the camel, and the hare, and the rock badger;
8 for they bring up the cud, but divide not the hoof; they are unclean unto you. And the swine; for it divideth the hoof, and cleaveth the claws of the hoof, yet it cheweth not the cud: it is unclean unto you. Ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their carcases.

9 And these ye shall eat of all that are in the waters:
10 whatsoever hath fins and scales, [these] ye shall eat. And whatsoever hath not fins nor scales, ye shall not eat [thereof];
11 they are unclean unto you. Every clean fowl ye shall eat.
12 And these are they of which ye shall not eat: the eagle, and the griffin, and
13 the osprey, and the mistletoe, and the vulture, and the kite, and
14 its kind; and every raven, and its kind;
15 and the ostrich, and the owl, and the cuckoo, and the hawk, and its kind;
16 and the heron, and the swan, and the ibis,
17 and the cormorant, [and] the hoopoes,
18 and the purple gallinule, and the night raven, and the pelican, and the charadrius,
19 and its kind, and the hoopoe, and the bat. All the creeping things of the winged ones, these are unclean unto you; ye shall not eat of them.
20 All clean winged ones ye shall eat.

21 And every carcase ye shall not eat. It shall be given unto the sojourner that is within thy cities, and he shall eat it; or thou shalt sell it unto a stranger: for thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God.
22 Thou shalt not boil a kid in its mother's milk.
