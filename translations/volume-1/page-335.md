ΔΕΥΤΕΡΟΝΟΜΙΟΝ ΚΕΦ. Ε΄. ς΄.

27 εἰπῇ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν πρὸς σέ, καὶ σὺ λαλήσεις πρὸς ἡμᾶς
πάντα ὅσα ἐὰν λαλήσῃ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν πρὸς σέ, καὶ ἀκουσόμεθα,
28 καὶ ποιήσομεν. Καὶ ἤκουσε Κύριος τὴν φωνὴν τῶν λόγων ὑμῶν
λαλούντων πρὸς με, καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς μέ· ἤκουσα τὴν φωνὴν
τῶν λόγων τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου, ὅσα ἐλάλησαν πρὸς σέ·
29 ὀρθῶς πάντα ὅσα ἐλάλησαν. Τίς δώσει εἶναι οὕτως τὴν καρδίαν
αὐτῶν ἐν αὐτοῖς, ὥστε φοβεῖσθαί με καὶ φυλάσσειν πάσας τὰς
ἐντολάς μου πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας, ἵνα εὖ ᾖ αὐτοῖς καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς
αὐτῶν δι᾽ αἰῶνος;
30 Βάδισον, εἶπον αὐτοῖς· ἀποστράφητε ὑμεῖς εἰς τοὺς οἴκους ὑμῶν.
31 Σὺ δὲ αὐτοῦ στῆθι μετ᾽ ἐμοῦ, καὶ λαλήσω πρὸς σὲ πάσας τὰς
ἐντολὰς καὶ τὰ δικαιώματα καὶ τὰ χρίματα, ὅσα διδάξεις αὐτούς·
καὶ ποιείτωσαν ἐν τῇ γῇ, ἣν ἐγὼ δίδωμι αὐτοῖς ἐν κλήρῳ.
32 Καὶ φυλάξεσθε ποιεῖν, ὃν τρόπον ἐνετείλατό σοι Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου·
οὐκ ἐκκλινεῖς εἰς δεξιά, οὐδὲ εἰς ἀριστερά·
33 κατὰ πᾶσαν τὴν ὁδόν, ἣν ἐνετείλατο Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου σοι,
πορεύεσθε, ὅπως καταπαύσῃ σε, καὶ εὖ σοι ᾖ, καὶ μακροημερεύσητε
ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, ἣν κληρονομήσετε.

ΚΕΦ. ς΄. VI.

1 ΚΑΙ αὗται αἱ ἐντολαὶ καὶ τὰ δικαιώματα καὶ τὰ χρίματα,
ὅσα ἐνετείλατο Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν διδάξαι ὑμᾶς, ποιεῖν οὕτως
ἐν τῇ γῇ, εἰς ἣν εἰσπορεύεσθε ὑμεῖς ἐκεῖ, κληρονομῆσαι αὐτήν·
2 ἵνα φοβῆσθε Κύριον τὸν Θεὸν ὑμῶν, φυλάσσεσθαι πάντα τὰ
δικαιώματα αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰς ἐντολὰς αὐτοῦ, ἃς ἐγὼ ἐντέλλομαί σοι
σήμερον, σὺ καὶ οἱ υἱοί σου, καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ τῶν υἱῶν σου, πάσας
3 ἡμέρας τῆς ζωῆς σου, ἵνα μακροημερεύσητε. Καὶ ἄκουσον Ἰσραήλ,
καὶ φύλαξαι ποιεῖν, ὅπως εὖ ᾖ σοι, καὶ ἵνα πληθυνθῆτε σφόδρα,
καθάπερ ἐλάλησε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τῶν πατέρων σου, δοῦναί σοι
γῆν ῥέουσαν γάλα καὶ μέλι.
4 Καὶ ταῦτα τὰ δικαιώματα καὶ τὰ χρίματα ὅσα ἐνετείλατο Κύριος
τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, ἐξελθόντων αὐτῶν ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου·
ἄκουε Ἰσραήλ, Κύριος ὁ
5 Θεὸς ἡμῶν, Κύριος εἷς ἐστι· καὶ ἀγαπήσεις Κύριον τὸν Θεόν σου
ἐξ ὅλης τῆς καρδίας σου, καὶ ἐξ ὅλης τῆς ψυχῆς σου, καὶ ἐξ
6 ὅλης τῆς δυνάμεώς σου. Καὶ ἔσται τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα, ὅσα ἐγὼ
ἐντέλλομαί σοι σήμερον, ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ σου, καὶ ἐν τῇ ψυχῇ σου·

**DEUTERONOMY CHAPTER 5**

27 If the LORD our God shall speak unto thee, then shalt thou speak unto us
all that ever the LORD our God shall speak unto thee; and we will hear [it],
and do [it].
28 And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto Me:
and the LORD said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people,
which they have spoken unto thee; rightly have they spoken all things which they have spoken.
29 O that there were such a heart in them, to fear Me
and to keep all My commandments all the days [of their lives],
that it might be well with them, and with their children forever!
30 Go, say unto them, Return ye unto your houses.
31 But as for thee, stand thou here with Me, and I will speak unto thee
all the commandments and the ordinances and the statutes,
which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land,
which I give them for an inheritance.
32 And ye shall observe to do as the LORD your God hath commanded thee:
thou shalt not turn aside to the right hand, nor to the left.
33 Ye shall walk in all the way which the LORD your God hath commanded thee;
that He may cause thee to rest, and it may be well with thee,
and ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall inherit.

**CHAPTER 6**

1 Now these are the commandments, the ordinances, and the statutes,
which the LORD your God commanded to teach you,
that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it:
2 that thou mightest fear the LORD thy God, to keep all His ordinances
and His commandments, which I command thee this day,
thou, and thy sons, and thy sons' sons, all the days of thy life,
that ye may prolong your days.
3 Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do [it];
that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily,
as the LORD God of thy fathers hath spoken unto thee,
to give thee a land flowing with milk and honey.
4 And these are the ordinances and the statutes which the LORD commanded
the children of Israel in the wilderness,
when they came forth out of the land of Egypt.
Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one.
5 And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thy heart,
and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.
6 And these words, which I command thee this day,
shall be in thy heart, and in thy soul.
