ΚΑΙ ἐξῆλθον πάντες οἱ υἱοὶ ᾿Ισραὴλ, καὶ ἐξεκκλησιάσθη πᾶσα 1
ἡ συναγωγὴ ὡς ἀνὴρ εἷς ἀπὸ Δὰν καὶ ἕως Βηρσαβεὲ, καὶ γῆ
Γαλαὰδ πρὸς Κύριον εἰς Μασσηφά. Καὶ ἔστη τὸ κλῖμα παντὸς 2
τοῦ λαοῦ (καὶ) πᾶσαι αἱ φυλαὶ ᾿Ισραὴλ ἐν τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ τοῦ
τοῦ Θεοῦ, τετρακόσιαι χιλιάδες ἀνδρῶν πεζῶν σπωμένων ῥομ-
φαίαν. Καὶ ἤκουσαν οἱ υἱοὶ Βενιαμὶν ὅτι ἀνέβησαν οἱ υἱοὶ ᾿Ισραὴλ 3
πρὸς Κύριον εἰς Μασσηφὰ, καὶ εἶπαν οἱ υἱοὶ ᾿Ισραήλ· λαλήσατε,
ποῦ ἐγένετο ἡ κακία αὕτη; Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη ὁ ἀνὴρ ὁ Λευΐτης, ὁ ἀνὴρ 4
τῆς γυναικὸς τῆς πεφονευμένης, καὶ εἶπεν· εἰς Γαβαὰθ τῆς Βενιαμὶν
ἦλθον ἐγὼ καὶ ἡ γυνή μου καταλῦσαι· καὶ ἀνέστησαν ἐπ᾿ ἐμὲ οἱ ἄνδρες 5
οἱ παρὰ τῆς Γαβαὰ, καὶ περιεκύκλωσαν ἐπ᾿ ἐμὲ τὴν οἰκίαν νυκτὸς, καὶ
ἐμὲ ἠθέλησαν ἀποκτεῖναι, καὶ τὴν παλλακήν μου ἐταπείνωσαν, καὶ
ἐνέπαιξαν αὐτῇ, καὶ ἀπέθανε. Καὶ ἐπελαβόμην τῆς παλλακῆς μου, 6
καὶ ἐμέλισα αὐτὴν, καὶ ἐξαπέστειλα ἐν παντὶ **ὁρίῳ** κληρονομίας
᾿Ισραὴλ, ὅτι ἐποίησαν ζέμμα καὶ ἀφροσύνην ἐν τῷ ᾿Ισραήλ. ᾿Ιδοῦ 7
πάντες ὑμεῖς οἱ υἱοὶ ᾿Ισραὴλ, δότε αὐτοῖς λόγον καὶ βουλὴν ὧδε.
Καὶ ἀνέστη πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ὡς ἀνὴρ εἷς, λέγων· οὐκ εἰσελευσόμεθα 8
ἀνὴρ εἷς τὸ σκήνωμα αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἐκκλινοῦμεν ἀνὴρ εἷς τὸν
οἶκον αὐτοῦ· καὶ νῦν τοῦτο τὸ ῥῆμα, ὃ ποιήσομεν τῇ Γαβαᾷ· ἀνα- 9
βησόμεθα ἐπ᾿ αὐτὴν ἐν κλήρῳ, καὶ ληψόμεθα δέκα ἄνδρας τοῖς 10
ἑκατὸν ταῖς πάσαις φυλαῖς ᾿Ισραὴλ, καὶ ἑκατὸν τοῖς χιλίοις, καὶ
χιλίους τοῖς μυρίοις, λαβεῖν ἐπισιτισμὸν τῷ λαῷ, ἐπιτελέσαι τοῖς
εἰσπορευομένοις τῇ Γαβαὰ τοῦ Βενιαμὶν κατὰ πᾶσαν τὴν ἀφρο-
σύνην, ἣν ἐποίησεν ἐν ᾿Ισραήλ. Καὶ συνήχθη πᾶς ἀνὴρ ᾿Ισραὴλ 11
ἐκ τῶν πόλεων, ὡς ἀνὴρ εἷς ἐρχόμενοι· καὶ ἐξαπέστειλαν αἱ φυ- 12
λαὶ ᾿Ισραὴλ ἄνδρας ἐν πάσῃ φυλῇ Βενιαμεὶν, λέγοντες· τίς ἡ
κακία αὕτη ἡ γενομένη ἐν ὑμῖν; καὶ νῦν δότε τοὺς ἄνδρας τοὺς 13
ἀσεβεῖς τοὺς ἐν Γαβαᾷ, τοὺς υἱοὺς Βελίαλ, καὶ θανατώσομεν αὐ-
τοὺς, καὶ ἐξαιροῦμεν κακίαν ἐξ ᾿Ισραήλ. Καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησαν εἰσ-
ακοῦσαι υἱοὶ Βενιαμεὶν τῆς φωνῆς τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτῶν τῶν υἱῶν
᾿Ισραήλ. Καὶ συνήχθησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Βενιαμεὶν ἐκ τῶν πόλεων αὐτῶν 14
εἰς Γαβαὰ, ἐξελθεῖν τοῦ πολεμῆσαι μετὰ υἱῶν ᾿Ισραήλ. Καὶ ἔπε- 15
σκέπησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Βενιαμεὶν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἐκ τῶν πόλεων

### Judges Chapter 20

**1.** And all the children of Israel went forth, and all the congregation was assembled as one man, from Dan even unto Beersheba, and the land of Gilead, unto the Lord at Mizpah.

**2.** And the array of all the people stood, (even) all the tribes of Israel, in the assembly of the of God, four hundred thousand men on foot, [who were] drawing sword.

**3.** And the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up unto the Lord at Mizpah. And the children of Israel said, "Speak ye, [and tell us] wherefore was this evil done?"

**4.** And the Levite, the husband of the woman who was slain, answered and said, "I came, and my wife with me, to Gibeah of Benjamin, to lodge there.

**5.** And the men of Gibeah rose up against me, and surrounded the house by night, and desired to slay me; and they humbled my concubine, and abused her, and she died.

**6.** And I took my concubine, and dismembered her, and sent her throughout every territory of the inheritance of Israel; for they have committed an outrageous and a foolish thing in Israel.

**7.** Behold, all ye children of Israel, give ye here [your] word and counsel concerning this matter."

**8.** And all the people arose as one man, saying, "We will not go in, every man unto his tent, neither will we turn aside, every man unto his house;

**9.** but now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah: We will go up against it by lot.

**10.** And we will take ten men out of an hundred, throughout all the tribes of Israel, and an hundred out of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victuals for the people, to the end that they may do unto Gibeah of Benjamin according to all the folly that she hath wrought in Israel."

**11.** So all the men of Israel were gathered together out of the cities, as one man, coming [forth].

**12.** And the tribes of Israel sent men throughout all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, "What wickedness is this that hath been committed among you?

**13.** Therefore now deliver us the wicked men, who are in Gibeah, those sons of Belial, that we may put them to death, and so put away evil from Israel." But the children of Benjamin would not hearken unto the voice of their brethren the children of Israel.

**14.** And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of their cities to Gibeah, to go forth to battle with the children of Israel.

**15.** And the children of Benjamin were mustered on that day out of their cities,
