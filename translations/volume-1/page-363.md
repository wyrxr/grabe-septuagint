οἰκία σου, καὶ κλαύσεται τὸν πατέρα αὐτῆς καὶ τὴν μητέρα αὐ-
τῆς μηνὸς ἡμέρας· καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα εἰσελεύσῃ πρὸς αὐτήν, καὶ
14 συνοικισθήσῃ αὐτῇ, καὶ ἔσται σοι γυνή. Καὶ ἔσται ἐὰν μὴ θέλῃς
αὐτήν, ἐξαποστελεῖς αὐτὴν ἐλευθέραν, καὶ πράσει οὐ πραθήσεται
15 ἀργυρίου· οὐκ ἀθετήσεις αὐτήν, διότι ἐταπείνωσας αὐτήν. Ἐὰν δὲ
γένωνται ἀνθρώπῳ δύο γυναῖκες, μία αὐτῶν ἠγαπημένη καὶ μία αὐτῶν
16 μισουμένη, καὶ τέκωσιν αὐτῷ υἱοὺς ἡ ἀγαπηπημένη καὶ ἡ μισουμένη, καὶ
γένηται υἱὸς πρωτότοκος τῆς μισουμένης, καὶ ἔσται ἡ ἐν ἡμέρᾳ κατακλη-
ροδοτῇ τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ τὰ ὑπάρχοντα αὐτοῦ, οὐ δυνήσεται πρωτοκεύ-
σαι τὸν υἱὸν τῆς ἠγαπημένης, ὑπεριδὼν τὸν υἱὸν τῆς μισουμένης τὸν πρω-
17 τότοκον· ἀλλὰ τὸν πρωτότοκον υἱὸν τῆς μισουμένης ἐπιγνώσεται,
δοῦναι αὐτῷ διπλᾶ ἀπὸ πάντων ὧν ἂν εὑρεθῇ αὐτῷ, ὅτι οὗτός
ἐστιν ἀρχὴ τέκνων αὐτοῦ, καὶ τούτῳ καθήκει τὰ πρωτοτοκεῖα.
18 Ἐὰν δέ τινι ᾖ υἱὸς ἀπειθὴς καὶ ἐρεθιστής, οὐχ ὑπακούων φω-
νὴν πατρὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ φωνὴν μητρὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ παιδεύσωσιν αὐτόν,
19 καὶ μὴ εἰσακούῃ αὐτῶν, καὶ συλλαβόντες αὐτὸν ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ καὶ
ἡ μήτηρ αὐτοῦ, ἐξάξουσιν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὴν γερουσίαν τῆς πόλεως
20 αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν πύλην τοῦ τόπου αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐροῦσι τοῖς ἀν-
δράσι τῆς πόλεως αὐτοῦ· ὁ υἱὸς ἡμῶν οὗτος ἀπειθεῖ καὶ ἐρεθίζει,
21 οὐκ ἀκούει τῆς φωνῆς ἡμῶν, συμβολοκοπῶν οἰνοφλυγεῖ· καὶ λιθο-
βολήσουσιν αὐτὸν πάντες οἱ ἄνδρες τῆς πόλεως αὐτοῦ ἐν λίθοις,
καὶ ἀποθανεῖται· καὶ ἐξαρεῖς τὸν πονηρὸν ἐξ ὑμῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ οἱ
22 ἐπίλοιποι ἀκούσαντες φοβηθήσονται. Ἐὰν δὲ γένηται ἐν τινι ἁμαρ-
τίᾳ κρίμα θανάτου, καὶ ἀποθάνῃ, καὶ κρεμάσῃ αὐτὸν ἐπὶ ξύλου,
23 οὐκ ἐπικοιμηθήσεται τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τοῦ ξύλου, ἀλλὰ ταφῇ
θάψετε αὐτὸν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, ὅτι κεκατηραμένος ὑπὸ Θεοῦ
πᾶς κρεμάμενος ἐπὶ ξύλου· καὶ οὐ μὴ μιάνετε τὴν γῆν, ἣν Κύριος
ὁ Θεός σου δίδωσί σοι ἐν κλήρῳ.

1 ΜΗ ἴδῃς τὸν μόσχον τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου ἢ τὸ πρόβατον αὐτοῦ
πλανώμενα ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ, ὑπερίδῃς αὐτά· ἀποστροφῇ ἀποστρέψεις αὐ-
2 τὰ τῷ ἀδελφῷ σου, (καὶ ἀποδώσεις αὐτῷ αὐτά). Ἐὰν δὲ μὴ ἐγ-
γίζῃ πρὸς σὲ ὁ ἀδελφός σου, μηδὲ ἐπίστῃ αὐτόν, συνάξεις αὐτὰ
ἔνδον εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν σου, καὶ ἔσται μετὰ σοῦ, ἕως ἂν ζητήσῃ αὐ-

**DEUTERONOMY CHAPTER 21**

your house; and she shall bewail her father and her mother for a full month of days. And thereafter you shall go in unto her, and shall be joined with her, and she shall be unto you a wife.
14 And it shall be, if you delight not in her, then you shall send her away free; and she shall not be sold for silver. You shall not deal ill with her, for you have humbled her.

15 If a man shall have two wives, the one greatly beloved and the other hated;
16 and they shall bear him sons, the greatly beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn son be of her that is hated; then it shall be, in the day that he causes his sons to inherit his possessions, that he shall not be able to make the son of the beloved the firstborn, thereby overlooking the son of the hated, who is the firstborn.
17 But he shall acknowledge the firstborn son of her that is hated, to give him a double portion of all that he possesses; for this son is the firstfruits of his vigor, and to him belongs the right of primogeniture.

18 If a man have a son who is stubborn and rebellious, not hearkening unto the voice of his father, nor unto the voice of his mother, and though they chasten him,
19 yet he does not hearken unto them; then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him forth unto the elders of his city,
20 and unto the gate of his place; and they shall say unto the men of his city:
"This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he hears not our voice; he is a glutton and a drunkard."
21 And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, and he shall die. And you shall remove the evil from among yourselves; and the rest who hear shall be afraid.

22 If a man be guilty of a sin deserving death, and he dies, and you hang him on a tree,
23 his body shall not remain overnight upon the tree, but you shall surely bury him on that same day; for cursed of God is everyone who hangs upon a tree. And you shall not defile the land which the Lord your God gives you for an inheritance.

**CHAPTER 22**

1 You shall not see your brother's ox or his sheep astray in the way, and disregard them; you shall surely bring them back to your brother, (and you shall restore them to him).
2 And if your brother be not near unto you, nor you know him, then you shall gather them into your house, and they shall be with you, until your brother seeks them.
