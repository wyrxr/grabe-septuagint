ΚΕΦ. Γ΄. Ι Η Σ Ο Υ Σ Ν Α Υ Η 379
ᾔραν οἱ ἱερεῖς τὴν κιβωτὸν τῆς διαθήκης Κυρίου, καὶ ἐπορεύοντο
ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ λαοῦ. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Ἰησοῦν· ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ 7
αὐτῇ ἄρχομαι ὑψῶσαί σε κατενώπιον πάντων τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ,
ἵνα γνῶσιν ὅτι καθότι ἤμην μετὰ Μωυσῆ, οὕτως ἔσομαι καὶ μετὰ
σοῦ. Καὶ νῦν ἐντείλαι τοῖς ἱερεῦσι τοῖς αἴρουσι τὴν κιβωτὸν τῆς 8
διαθήκης, λέγων· ὡς ἂν εἰσέλθητε ἐπὶ μέρους τοῦ ὕδατος τοῦ
Ἰορδάνου, καὶ ἐν τῷ Ἰορδάνῃ στήσεσθε. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰησοῦς τοῖς 9
υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ· προσαγάγετε ὧδε, καὶ ἀκούσατε τὸ ῥῆμα Κυρίου
τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰησοῦς· ἐν τούτῳ γνώσεσθε, ὅτι (ἐγὼ) 10
Κύριος ζῶν ἐν ὑμῖν, καὶ ὀλοθρεύων ὀλοθρεύσει ἀπὸ προσώπου ὑ-
μῶν τὸν Χαναναιοῦν, καὶ τὸν Χετταῖον, καὶ τὸν Εὐαῖον, καὶ τὸν
Φερεζαῖον, καὶ τὸν Γεργεσαῖον, καὶ τὸν Ἀμοῤῥαῖον, καὶ τὸν Ἰε-
βουσαῖον. Ἰδοὺ ἡ κιβωτὸς τῆς διαθήκης Κυρίου πάσης τῆς γῆς 11
διαβαίνει ἔμπροσθεν ὑμῶν τὸν Ἰορδάνην. Καὶ νῦν προχειρίσασθε 12
ὑμῖν δώδεκα ἄνδρας ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, ἄνδρα ἕνα ἐφ᾽ ἑκά-
στης φυλῆς. Καὶ ἔσται ὡς ἂν καταπαύσωσιν οἱ πόδες τῶν ἱερέων 13
τῶν αἰρόντων τὴν κιβωτὸν τῆς διαθήκης Κυρίου πάσης τῆς γῆς
ἐν τῷ ὕδατι τοῦ Ἰορδάνου, τὸ ὕδωρ τοῦ Ἰορδάνου ἐκλείψει, τὸ δὲ
ὕδωρ τὸ καταβαῖνον ἄνωθεν στήσεται εἰς σωρός. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς 14
ἀπῆρεν ὁ λαὸς ἐκ τῶν σκηνωμάτων αὐτῶν διαβῆναι τὸν Ἰορδάνην,
οἱ δὲ ἱερεῖς ἦραν τὴν κιβωτὸν τῆς διαθήκης Κυρίου πρότεροι τοῦ
λαοῦ. Ὡς δὲ εἰσεπορεύοντο οἱ ἱερεῖς αἴροντες τὴν κιβωτὸν τῆς δια- 15
θήκης ἐπὶ τὸν Ἰορδάνην, καὶ οἱ πόδες τῶν ἱερέων τῶν αἰρόντων
τὴν κιβωτὸν ἐβάφησαν εἰς τὸ μέρος τοῦ ὕδατος τοῦ Ἰορδάνου, ὁ
δὲ Ἰορδάνης ἐπλήρου καθ᾽ ὅλην τὴν κρηπῖδα αὐτοῦ, ὡσεὶ ἡμέραι
θερισμοῦ πυρῶν· καὶ ἔστη τὰ ὕδατα τὰ καταβαίνοντα ἄνωθεν, ἔστη 16
πῆγμα ἐν ἀρεστηκὸς μακρὰν σφόδρα σφοδρῶς ἕως μέρους Καριά-
θιαρίμ· τὸ δὲ καταβαῖνον κατέβη εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν Ἄραβα, θά-
λασσαν τῶν ἁλῶν ἕως εἰς τὸ τέλος ἐξέλιπε· καὶ ὁ λαὸς εἱ-
στήχει ἀπέναντι Ἰεριχώ. Καὶ ἔστησαν οἱ ἱερεῖς οἱ αἴροντες τὴν 17
κιβωτὸν τῆς διαθήκης Κυρίου ἐπὶ ξηρᾶς ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ Ἰορδάνου
ἑτοίμως· καὶ πάντες οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ διέβαινον διὰ ξηρᾶς, ἕως συ-
νετέλεσε πᾶς ὁ λαὸς διαβαίνων τὸν Ἰορδάνην.

**Joshua 3**

6 Then the priests took up the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and went before the people.
7 And the Lord said unto Joshua, "This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all the children of Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so will I be with thee.
8 Now therefore command thou the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, 'When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye shall stand still in the Jordan.'"
9 And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, "Come hither, and hear the word of the Lord our God."
10 And Joshua said, "Hereby shall ye know that I, the living Lord, am among you, and that I shall utterly destroy from before your face the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Hivite, and the Perizzite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Jebusite.
11 Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan.
12 Now therefore choose ye twelve men out of the children of Israel, a man for every tribe.
13 And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off; and the waters that come down from above shall stand as a heap."
14 And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents to pass over Jordan, that the priests took up the ark of the covenant of the Lord before the people.
15 And as the priests that bare the ark of the covenant came unto the Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped into the brink of the water of Jordan, (for Jordan was full throughout all its banks, as in the days of wheat harvest,)
16 that the waters which came down from above stood still; [and there] stood a heap, in a pleasing [fashion], very far off with exceeding great might, unto the region of Kiriath-jearim; but that which came down towards the Sea of Araba, the Salt Sea, utterly failed until the end thereof; and the people stood over against Jericho.
17 And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, ready; and all the children of Israel passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over Jordan.
