138 ΕΞΟΔΟΣ ΚΕΦ ΚΓʹ. ΚΔʹ.
32 μεγάλου Εὐφράτου· καὶ παρδώσω εἰς χεῖρας ὑμῶν τοὺς ἐγκαθημένους ἐν τῇ γῇ, καὶ ἐκβαλῶ αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ σοῦ. Οὐ συγκαταθήσῃ
33 αὐτοῖς καὶ τοῖς θεοῖς αὐτῶν διαθήκην. Καὶ οὐκ ἐγκαθήσονται ἐν τῇ γῇ σου, ἵνα μὴ ἁμαρτεῖν σε ποιήσωσι πρὸς με· ἐὰν γὰρ δουλεύσῃς τοῖς θεοῖς αὐτῶν, οὗτοι ἔσονται σοι πρόσκομμα.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΔʹ. XXIV.

1 ΚΑΙ Μωυσῇ εἶπεν ἀνάβηθι πρὸς Κύριον σὺ καὶ ᾿Ααρών, καὶ Ναδάβ, καὶ ᾿Αβιούδ, καὶ ἑβδομήκοντα τῶν πρεσβυτέρων ᾿Ισραήλ,
2 καὶ προσκυνήσουσι μακρόθεν τῷ Κυρίῳ· καὶ ἐγγιεῖ Μωυσῆς μόνος πρὸς τὸν Θεόν, αὐτοὶ δὲ οὐκ ἐγγιοῦσιν· ὁ δὲ λαὸς οὐ συναναβήσεται μετ᾿ αὐτῶν.
3 Εἰσῆλθε δὲ Μωυσῆς, καὶ διηγήσατο τῷ λαῷ πάντα τὰ ῥήματα τοῦ Θεοῦ καὶ τὰ δικαιώματα· ἀπεκρίθη δὲ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς φωνῇ μιᾷ, λέγοντες· πάντας τοὺς λόγους, οὓς ἐλάλησε Κύριος, ποιήσομεν, καὶ ἀκουσόμεθα.
4 Καὶ ἔγραψε Μωυσῆς πάντα τὰ ῥήματα Κυρίου. ᾿Ορθρίσας δὲ Μωυσῆς τὸ πρωΐ, ᾠκοδόμησε θυσιαστήριον ὑπὸ τὸ ὄρος, καὶ δώδεκα λίθους εἰς τὰς δώδεκα φυλὰς τοῦ ᾿Ισραήλ·
5 καὶ ἐξαπέστειλε τοὺς νεανίσκους τῶν υἱῶν ᾿Ισραήλ, καὶ ἀνήνεγκαν ὁλοκαυτώματα, καὶ ἔθυσαν θυσίαν σωτηρίου τῷ Θεῷ μοσχάρια.
6 Λαβὼν δὲ Μωυσῆς τὸ ἥμισυ τοῦ αἵματος, ἐνέχεεν εἰς κρατῆρας· τὸ δὲ ἥμισυ τοῦ αἵματος προσέχεε πρὸς τὸ θυσιαστήριον.
7 Καὶ λαβὼν τὸ βιβλίον τῆς διαθήκης, ἀνέγνω εἰς τὰ ὦτα τοῦ λαοῦ· καὶ εἶπαν· πάντα ὅσα ἐλάλησε Κύριος, ποιήσομεν, καὶ ἀκουσόμεθα.
8 Λαβὼν δὲ Μωυσῆς τὸ αἷμα, κατεσκέδασε τοῦ λαοῦ, καὶ εἶπεν· ἰδοὺ τὸ αἷμα τῆς διαθήκης, ἧς διεθέτο Κύριος πρὸς ὑμᾶς περὶ πάντων τῶν λόγων τούτων.
9 Καὶ ἀνέβη Μωυσῆς καὶ ᾿Ααρών, καὶ Ναδάβ, καὶ ᾿Αβιούδ, καὶ ἑβδομήκοντα τῶν πρεσβυτέρων ᾿Ισραήλ,
10 καὶ εἶδον τὸν τόπον οὗ εἱστήκει ἐκεῖ ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ ᾿Ισραήλ· καὶ τὰ ὑπὸ τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ ὡσεὶ ἔργον πλίνθου σαπφείρου, καὶ ὥσπερ εἶδος στερεώματος τοῦ οὐρανοῦ τῇ καθαρότητι.
11 Καὶ τῶν ἐπιλέκτων τοῦ ᾿Ισραὴλ οὐ διεφώνησεν οὐδὲ εἷς· καὶ ὤφθησαν ἐν τῷ τόπῳ τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ ἔφαγον, καὶ ἔπιον.
12 Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν· ἀνάβηθι πρὸς με εἰς τὸ ὄρος, καὶ ἴσθι ἐκεῖ· καὶ δώσω σοι τὰ πυξία τὰ λίθινα, τὸν νόμον καὶ τὰς ἐντολάς, ἃς ἔγραψα νομοθετῆσαι αὐτοῖς.
13 Καὶ ἀναστὰς Μωυσῆς καὶ ᾿Ιησοῦς

**EXODUS CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE**

32 the great river Euphrates; and I shall deliver into your hands those who dwell in the land, and I shall cast them out from before thee.
33 Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods. And they shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against Me; for if thou serve their gods, these shall be unto thee a stumbling block.

**CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR**

1 And unto Moses He said: Come up unto the Lord, thou, and Aaron, and Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel.
2 And ye shall worship afar off; but Moses alone shall draw nigh unto God; and they shall not draw nigh, nor shall the people ascend with them.
3 And Moses came and recounted unto the people all the words of God and His ordinances; and all the people answered with one voice, saying, All the words which the Lord hath spoken, them will we do, and we shall hearken [unto them].
4 And Moses wrote all the words of the Lord. And Moses rose up early in the morning, and built an altar beneath the mountain, and twelve stones for the twelve tribes of Israel.
5 And he sent forth the young men of the sons of Israel, and they offered up whole burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings unto God, [even] calves.
6 And Moses took half of the blood, and poured it into bowls; and the other half of the blood he poured out toward the altar.
7 And taking the book of the covenant, he read it in the ears of the people; and they said, All that the Lord hath spoken, will we do, and we shall hearken [unto it].
8 And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it upon the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the Lord hath made with you concerning all these words.
9 Then went up Moses, and Aaron, and Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel.
10 And they saw the place where the God of Israel stood there; and beneath His feet was as it were a work of sapphire brick, and as it were the very form of the firmament of heaven in its purity.
11 And of the chosen ones of Israel, not one was consumed [by the divine presence]; and they were seen in the place of God, and they ate, and they drank.
12 And the Lord said unto Moses, Come up unto Me into the mountain, and be there: and I will give thee the stone tablets, the Law and the commandments, which I have written to enact for them.
13 And Moses arose, and Joshua.
