ΚΕΦ. ΙΘʹ. ΚΡΙΤΑΙ 465
ὧδε ἔτι σήμερον, καὶ μείνατε ὧδε, καὶ ἀγαθυνθήτω ἡ καρδία
σου· καὶ ὀρθρίζετε αὔριον εἰς τὴν ὁδὸν ὑμῶν, καὶ ἀπελεύσεσθε
σκήνωμά σου. Καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησεν ὁ ἀνὴρ αὐλισθῆναι, καὶ ἀνέστη, 10
καὶ ἀπῆλθε· καὶ παρεγένοντο ἕως κατέναντι Ἰεβούς, (αὕτη ἐστὶν
Ἱερουσαλήμ) καὶ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ζεῦγος ὑποζυγίων ἐπισεσαγμένων,
καὶ ἡ παλλακὴ αὐτοῦ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ. Ἔτι αὐτῶν ὄντων κατὰ Ἱε- 11
βούς, καὶ ἡ ἡμέρα κεκλικυῖα σφόδρα· καὶ εἶπε τὸ παιδάριον πρὸς
τὸν κύριον αὐτοῦ· δεῦρο δὴ, καὶ ἐκκλίνωμεν εἰς τὴν πόλιν τοῦ
Ἰεβουσαίου ταύτην, καὶ αὐλισθῶμεν ἐν αὐτῇ. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ κύριος 12
αὐτοῦ πρὸς αὐτόν· οὐ μὴ ἐκκλινῶ εἰς πόλιν ἀλλοτρίαν, ἣ οὐκ
ἔστιν ἐκ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ παρελευσόμεθα ἕως Γαβαά. Καὶ 13
εἶπε τῷ παιδαρίῳ αὐτοῦ· δεῦρο, καὶ ἔλθωμεν εἰς ἕνα τῶν τό-
πων, καὶ αὐλισθῶμεν ἐν Γαβαὰ ἢ ἐν Ῥαμᾷ. Καὶ παρῆλθον, καὶ 14
ἀπῆλθον (ἐν Γαβαά), καὶ ἔδυ αὐτοῖς ὁ ἥλιος ἐχόμενον τῆς Γαβαά,
ἣ ἐστι τοῦ Βενιαμείν. Καὶ ἐξέκλιναν ἐκεῖ τοῦ εἰσελθεῖν καταλῦ- 15
σαι ἐν Γαβαά· καὶ εἰσῆλθον, καὶ ἐκάθισαν ἐν τῇ πλατείᾳ τῆς
πόλεως, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἀνὴρ ὁ συνάγων αὐτοὺς εἰς τὸν οἶκον καταλῦσαι.
Καὶ ἰδοὺ ἀνὴρ πρεσβύτης εἰσῆλθεν ἀπὸ τῶν ἔργων αὐτοῦ ἐκ τοῦ 16
ἀγροῦ ἑσπέρας, καὶ ὁ ἀνὴρ ἐξ ὄρους Ἐφραίμ, καὶ αὐτὸς παρώκει
ἐν Γαβαά· καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες τοῦ τόπου, υἱοὶ Βενιαμείν. Καὶ ἀνα- 17
βλέψας τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτοῦ, ἴδε τὸν ἄνδρα τὸν ὁδοιπόρον ἐν τῇ
πλατείᾳ τῆς πόλεως, καὶ εἶπεν ὁ ἀνὴρ ὁ πρεσβύτης· ποῦ πορεύῃ, καὶ
πόθεν ἔρχῃ; Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτόν· διαβαίνομεν ἡμεῖς ἐκ Βηθλεὲμ 18
τῆς Ἰούδα ἕως μηροῦ (ἕως) ὄρους τοῦ Ἐφραίμ· ἐγὼ δὲ ἐκεῖθεν
εἰμι, καὶ ἐπορεύθην ἕως Βηθλεὲμ Ἰούδα, καὶ εἰς τὸν οἶκόν μου
ἐγὼ ἀποτρέχω, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἀνὴρ συνάγων με εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν.
Καί γε ἄχυρα καὶ χορτάσματα ὑπάρχει τοῖς ὄνοις ἡμῶν, καί γε 19
ἄρτος καὶ οἶνος ὑπάρχει μοι καὶ τῇ δούλῃ σου καὶ τῷ παιδαρίῳ·
τοῖς δούλοις σου οὐκ ἔστιν ὑστέρημα παντὸς πράγματος. Καὶ εἶ- 20
πεν ὁ ἀνὴρ ὁ πρεσβύτης· εἰρήνη σοι· πλὴν πᾶν τὸ ὑστέρημά σου
ἐπ᾿ ἐμέ, πλὴν ἐν τῇ πλατείᾳ μὴ καταλύσῃς. Καὶ εἰσήγαγεν αὐτὸν 21
εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν αὐτοῦ, καὶ παρενέβαλε τοῖς ὑποζυγίοις αὐτοῦ· καὶ
ἔνιψε τοὺς πόδας αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔφαγον, καὶ ἔπιον. Αὐτῶν δὲ ἀγα- 22
θυνθέντων τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἰδοὺ οἱ ἄνδρες τῆς πόλεως ἄνδρες
υἱοὶ παρανόμων περιεκύκλωσαν τὴν οἰκίαν, καὶ ἔκρουσαν τὴν θύραν,
καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς τὸν ἄνδρα τὸν κύριον τῆς οἰκίας τὸν πρεσβύτην,

### Judges Chapter 19

**9.** "...here yet this day, and abide here, and let thy heart be merry: and rise up early tomorrow for your journey, and you shall go unto your dwelling place."

**10.** But the man would not tarry all night, but he rose up and departed; and they came as far as over against Jebus (which is Jerusalem); and with him there were a pair of saddled asses, and his concubine was with him.

**11.** When they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said unto his master, "Come, I pray you, and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it."

**12.** And his master said unto him, "I will not turn aside into a city of strangers, which belongeth not unto the children of Israel; but we will pass over to Gibeah."

**13.** And he said unto his servant, "Come, and let us draw near unto one of these places, and lodge in Gibeah, or in Ramah."

**14.** So they passed on, and went [to Gibeah]; and the sun went down upon them when they were by Gibeah, which pertaineth to Benjamin.

**15.** And they turned aside thither, to go in and to lodge in Gibeah; and they went in, and sat them down in a public square of the city: for there was no man that took them into his house to lodge.

**16.** And behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even; and the man was of Mount Ephraim, and he sojourned in Gibeah: but the men of the place were sons of Benjamin.

**17.** And when he lifted up his eyes, he saw the wayfaring man in the public square of the city: and the old man said, "Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou?"

**18.** And he said unto him, "We are passing from Bethlehem-Judah unto the ridge [even unto] Mount Ephraim; [for] I am from thence, and I went unto Bethlehem-Judah, and to my house I now return; and there is no man that taketh me into his house."

**19.** "Indeed, we have both straw and fodder for our asses; and indeed, we have bread and wine for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man; [thus] for us, thy servants, there is no lack of any thing."

**20.** And the old man said, "Peace be unto thee; howbeit all thy wants [shall be] upon me: only lodge not in the public square."

**21.** So he brought him into his house, and gave provender unto his asses: and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.

**22.** Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, [even] sons of lawless men, did compass the house round about, and beat at the door, and spake to the master of the house, the old man, [saying,]
