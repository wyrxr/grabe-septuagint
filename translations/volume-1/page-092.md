Τὸ δὲ ὄνομα τοῦ δευτέρου ἐκάλεσεν Ἐφραΐμ· ὅτι ηὔξησέ με ὁ 52
Θεὸς ἐν γῇ ταπεινώσεώς μου. Παρελθόντων δὲ τὰ ἑπτὰ ἔτη τῆς 53
εὐθηνίας, ἃ ἐγένετο ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ. Καὶ ἤρξαντο τὰ ἑπτὰ ἔτη 54
τοῦ λιμοῦ ἔρχεσθαι, καθὰ εἶπεν Ἰωσήφ, καὶ ἐγένετο λιμὸς ἐν
πάσῃ τῇ γῇ· ἐν δὲ πάσῃ γῇ Αἰγύπτου (οὐκ) ἦσαν ἄρτοι. Καὶ 55
ἐπείνασε πᾶσα ἡ γῆ Αἰγύπτου· ἐκέκραζε δὲ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς πρὸς
Φαραὼ περὶ ἄρτων. Εἶπε δὲ Φαραὼ πᾶσι τοῖς Αἰγυπτίοις· πο-
ρεύεσθε πρὸς Ἰωσήφ, καὶ ἃ ἐὰν εἴπῃ ὑμῖν, ποιήσατε. Καὶ ὁ λι- 56
μὸς ἦν ἐπὶ προσώπου πάσης τῆς γῆς· ἀνέωξε δὲ Ἰωσὴφ πάντας
τοὺς σιτοβολῶνας, καὶ ἐπώλει πᾶσι τοῖς Αἰγυπτίοις. Καὶ πᾶσαι 57
αἱ χῶραι ἦλθον εἰς Αἴγυπτον ἀγοράζειν πρὸς Ἰωσήφ· ἐπεκράτησε
γὰρ ὁ λιμὸς ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ.

ΚΕΦ. ΜΒ´. XLII.

ἼΔΩΝ δὲ Ἰακὼβ ὅτι ἐστὶ πρᾶσις ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ, εἶπε τοῖς υἱοῖς 1
αὐτοῦ· ἱνατί ῥᾳθυμεῖτε; Ἰδοὺ ἀκήκοα, ὅτι ἐστὶ σῖτος ἐν Αἰγύ- 2
πτῳ· κατάβητε ἐκεῖ, καὶ πρίασθε ἡμῖν ἐκεῖθεν μικρὰ βρώματα, 3
ἵνα ζῶμεν, καὶ μὴ ἀποθάνωμεν. Κατέβησαν δὲ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ Ἰω-
σήφ, οἱ δέκα, πρίασθαι σῖτον ἐξ Αἰγύπτου· τὸν δὲ Βενιαμὶν τὸν 4
ἀδελφὸν Ἰωσὴφ οὐκ ἀπέστειλεν Ἰακὼβ μετὰ τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτοῦ.
Εἶπε γάρ· μή ποτε συμβῇ αὐτῷ μαλακία. Ἦλθον δὲ οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσ- 5
ραὴλ ἀγοράζειν μετὰ τῶν ἐρχομένων· ἦν γὰρ ὁ λιμὸς ἐν γῇ
Χαναάν. Ἰωσὴφ δὲ ἦν ἄρχων τῆς γῆς· οὗτος ἐπώλει παντὶ τῷ 6
λαῷ τῆς γῆς. Ἐλθόντες δὲ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ Ἰωσήφ, προσεκύνησαν
αὐτῷ ἐπὶ πρόσωπον ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν. Ἰδὼν δὲ Ἰωσὴφ τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς 7
αὐτοῦ, ἐπέγνω αὐτούς· καὶ ἠλλοτριοῦτο ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐλάλη-
σεν αὐτοῖς σκληρά. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· πόθεν ἥκατε; Οἱ δὲ εἶπαν·
ἐκ γῆς Χαναάν, ἀγοράσαι βρώματα. Ἐπέγνω δὲ Ἰωσὴφ τοὺς ἀ- 8
δελφοὺς αὐτοῦ· αὐτοὶ δὲ οὐκ ἐπέγνωσαν αὐτόν. Καὶ ἐμνήσθη Ἰω- 9
σὴφ τῶν ἐνυπνίων, ὧν ἴδεν αὐτός, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· κατάσκοποι
ἐστε, κατανοῆσαι τὰ ἴχνη τῆς χώρας ἥκατε. Οἱ δὲ εἶπαν· οὐχί 10
κύριε· οἱ παῖδες σου ἤλθομεν πρίασθαι βρώματα. Πάντες ἐσμὲν 11
υἱοὶ ἑνὸς ἀνθρώπου· εἰρηνικοί ἐσμεν, οὐκ εἰσὶν οἱ παῖδες σου κα-
τάσκοποι. Εἶπε δὲ αὐτοῖς· οὐχί, ἀλλὰ τὰ ἴχνη τῆς γῆς ἤλθετε 12
ἰδεῖν. Οἱ δὲ εἶπαν· δώδεκα ἐσμεν οἱ παῖδες σου ἀδελφοὶ ἐν γῇ 13

**CHAPTER XLI.**

52 And the name of the second son he called Ephraim; for God hath made me fruitful in the land of my humiliation.
53 And when the seven years of plenteousness were past, which had come to pass in the land of Egypt,
54 then began the seven years of famine to come, even as Joseph had spoken; and a famine came upon all the earth.
55 But in all the land of Egypt, (there were) no loaves. And all the land of Egypt hungered; and all the people cried unto Pharaoh for bread.
56 And Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, "Go unto Joseph; and whatsoever he shall say unto you, that do ye." And the famine was upon the face of all the earth;
57 then Joseph opened all the granaries, and sold unto all the Egyptians. And all the countries came into Egypt unto Joseph to buy [grain]; for the famine prevailed throughout all the earth.

**CHAPTER XLII.**

1 NOW when Jacob saw that there was grain for sale in Egypt, he said unto his sons, "Wherefore are ye idle?
2 Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt;
3 get you down thither, and purchase for us from thence a little food, that we may live, and not die."
4 So Joseph's brethren, the ten [in number], went down to purchase grain from Egypt. But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren;
5 for he said, "Lest peradventure misfortune befall him." And the sons of Israel came to buy [grain] among those who came; for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
6 Now Joseph was the ruler of the land, and he it was who sold unto all the people of the land. And when Joseph's brethren came, they bowed themselves before him with their faces to the earth.
7 And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but he made himself a stranger unto them, and spake harshly unto them. And he said unto them, "From whence come ye?" And they said,
8 "From the land of Canaan, to purchase food." And Joseph knew his brethren; but they knew not him.
9 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he himself had seen, and said unto them, "Ye are spies; ye are come to observe the traces of the land."
10 And they said unto him, "Nay, my lord; thy servants are come to purchase food.
11 We are all sons of one man; we are peaceable men, thy servants are not spies."
12 And he said unto them, "Nay, but ye are come to see the traces of the land."
13 And they said, "Thy servants are twelve brethren in the land [of Canaan];
