ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ ΚΕΦ. ΙΓʹ. ΙΔʹ.
5 Καὶ Λὼτ τῷ συμπορευομένῳ μετὰ Ἄβραμ ἦν πρόβατα, καὶ βόες,
6 καὶ σκηναί· καὶ οὐκ ἐχώρει αὐτοὺς ἡ γῆ κατοικεῖν ἅμα, ὅτι ἦν
   τὰ ὑπάρχοντα αὐτῶν πολλά· καὶ οὐκ ἐδύναντο κατοικεῖν ἅμα.
7 Καὶ ἐγένετο μάχη ἀνὰ μέσον τῶν ποιμένων τῶν κτηνῶν τοῦ Ἄ-
   βραμ καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον τῶν ποιμένων τῶν κτηνῶν τοῦ Λώτ· οἱ δὲ
8 Χαναναῖοι καὶ οἱ Φερεζαῖοι τότε κατώκουν τὴν γῆν. Εἶπε δὲ Ἄ-
   βραμ τῷ Λώτ· μὴ ἔστω μάχη ἀνὰ μέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ σοῦ, καὶ ἀνὰ
   μέσον τῶν ποιμένων μου καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον τῶν ποιμένων σου, ὅτι
9 ἄνθρωποι ἀδελφοὶ ἡμεῖς ἐσμέν. Οὐκ ἰδοὺ πᾶσα ἡ γῆ ἐναντίον σου;
10 σὺ εἰς δεξιά, ἐγὼ εἰς ἀριστερά· Καὶ ἐπάρας Λὼτ τοὺς ὀφθαλ-
   μοὺς αὐτοῦ, ἴδε πᾶσαν τὴν περίχωρον τοῦ Ἰορδάνου, ὅτι πᾶσα
   ἦν ποτιζομένη, πρὸ τοῦ καταστρέψαι τὸν Θεὸν Σόδομα καὶ Γό-
   μορρα, ὡς ὁ παράδεισος τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ ὡς ἡ γῆ Αἰγύπτου, ἕως
11 ἐλθεῖν εἰς Ζόγορα. Καὶ ἐξελέξατο ἑαυτῷ Λὼτ πᾶσαν τὴν περί-
   χωρον τοῦ Ἰορδάνου, καὶ ἀπῆρε Λὼτ ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν· καὶ διεχω-
12 ρίσθησαν ἕκαστος ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ. Ἄβραμ δὲ κατῴκησεν
   ἐν γῇ Χαναάν· Λὼτ δὲ κατῴκησεν ἐν πόλει τῶν περιχώρων, καὶ
13 ἐσκήνωσεν ἐν Σοδόμοις. Οἱ δὲ ἄνθρωποι οἱ ἐν Σοδόμοις πονηροὶ
   καὶ ἁμαρτωλοὶ ἐναντίον τοῦ Θεοῦ σφόδρα. Ὁ δὲ Θεὸς εἶπε τῷ
14 Ἄβραμ, μετὰ τὸ διαχωρισθῆναι τὸν Λὼτ ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ· ἀνάβλεψον
   τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς σου, καὶ ἴδε ἀπὸ τοῦ τόπου οὗ νῦν σὺ εἶ, πρὸς
15 βορρᾶν καὶ λίβα καὶ ἀνατολὰς καὶ θάλασσαν· ὅτι πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν,
   ἣν σὺ ὁρᾷς, σοὶ δώσω αὐτὴν καὶ τῷ σπέρματί σου ἕως τοῦ αἰῶ-
16 νος. Καὶ ποιήσω τὸ σπέρμα σου, ὡς τὴν ἄμμον τῆς γῆς· εἰ δύ-
   ναταί τις ἐξαριθμῆσαι τὴν ἄμμον τῆς γῆς, καὶ τὸ σπέρμα σου
17 ἀριθμηθήσεται. Ἀναστὰς διόδευσον τὴν γῆν εἰς τε τὸ μῆκος αὐ-
   τῆς, καὶ εἰς τὸ πλάτος· ὅτι σοι δώσω αὐτὴν καὶ τῷ σπέρματί
18 σου εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα. Καὶ ἀποσκηνώσας Ἄβραμ, ἐλθὼν κατῴκησε
   παρὰ τὴν δρῦν τὴν Μαμβρῆν, ἣ ἦν ἐν Χεβρών· καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν
   ἐκεῖ θυσιαστήριον Κυρίῳ.

                  ΚΕΦ. ΙΔʹ. XIV.
1 ΕΓΕΝΕΤΟ δὲ ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ τῇ Ἀμαρφὰλ βασιλέως Σεν-

**GENESIS CHAPTER 13**

5 And Lot, who journeyed with Abram, had sheep, and oxen,
6 and tents. And the land could not sustain them, that they might dwell together, for their possessions were many; and they could not dwell together.
7 And there arose strife between the herdsmen of Abram’s cattle and between the herdsmen of Lot’s cattle. Now the Canaanites and the Perizzites then dwelt in the land.
8 Then Abram said unto Lot, “Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdsmen and between thy herdsmen, for
9 we are brethren. Behold, is not all the land before thee?
10 Thou [go] to the right, and I to the left.” And Lot lifted up his eyes, and saw all the region round about Jordan, that it was all watered, before God did destroy Sodom and Gomorrah, as the paradise of God, and as the land of Egypt, even until
11 one comes unto Zoar. Then Lot chose for himself all the region round about Jordan, and Lot departed from the east; and they separated
12 each one from his brother. And Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan; but Lot dwelt in a city of the region round about, and
13 pitched his tent in Sodom. But the men who were in Sodom were wicked and sinners exceedingly before God.
14 And God said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, “Lift up thine eyes, and behold from the place where thou now art, to the north and
15 to the south, and to the east and to the sea; for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed forever.
16 And I will make thy seed as the sand of the earth; if any man can number the sand of the earth, then shall thy seed
17 also be numbered. Arise, walk through the land in its length, and in its breadth; for to thee will I give it, and to thy seed
18 forever.” And Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt by the oak of Mamre, which was in Hebron; and he built there an altar unto the Lord.
