ρίου ἐγένετο, κατισχύσαι τὴν καρδίαν αὐτῶν συναντᾷν εἰς πόλε-
μον πρὸς Ἰσραήλ, ἵνα ἐξολοθρευθῶσιν, ἔπως μὴ δοθῇ αὐτοῖς ἔλε-
ος, ἀλλ᾿ ἵνα ἐξολοθρευθῶσιν, ὃν τρόπον εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Μω-
21 υσῆν. Καὶ ἦλθεν Ἰησοῦς ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ, καὶ ἐξωλόθρευσε
τοὺς Ἐνακὶμ ἐκ τῆς ὀρεινῆς ἐκ Χεβρὼν, καὶ ἐκ Δαβεὶρ, καὶ ἐξ Ἄ-
νὼβ, καὶ ἐκ παντὸς ὄρους Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐκ παντὸς ὄρους Ἰούδα
22 σὺν ταῖς πόλεσιν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐξωλόθρευσεν αὐτοὺς Ἰησοῦς˙ οὐ κα-
τελείφθησαν τῶν Ἐνακὶμ ὑπὸ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, ἀλλὰ πλὴν ἐν
23 Γάζῃ καὶ ἐν Γὲθ, καὶ ἐν Ἀσεδὼθ κατελείφθησαν. Καὶ ἔλαβεν
Ἰησοῦς τὴν πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν, καθότι ἐνετείλατο Κύριος τῷ Μω-
υσῇ˙ καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὴν Ἰησοῦς ἐν κληρονομίᾳ Ἰσραὴλ ἐν μερι-
σμῷ αὐτῶν, κατὰ φυλὰς αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἡ γῆ κατέπαυσε πολε-
μουμένη.

οἱ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ κατεκληρονόμησαν τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν πέραν τοῦ Ἰορ-

**Joshua 11**

<sup>20</sup> [For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle,] that they might be utterly destroyed, and that no mercy should be shown them, but that they might be utterly destroyed, as the LORD commanded Moses.
<sup>21</sup> And it came to pass at that time, that Joshua came and utterly destroyed the Anakim from the hill country, from Hebron, and from Debir, and from Anab, and from all the mountain of Israel, and from all the mountain of Judah,
<sup>22</sup> with their cities. And Joshua utterly destroyed them; there were none of the Anakim left under the children of Israel, but only in Gaza, and in Gath, and in Ashdod were they left.
<sup>23</sup> So Joshua took all the land, according as the LORD had commanded Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel, in their divisions, according to their tribes. And the land rested from war.

**Joshua 12**

<sup>1</sup> Now these are the kings of the land whom Moses and the children of Israel slew, and whose land they inherited beyond Jordan, toward the rising of the sun, from the valley of Arnon unto Mount Hermon, and all the Arabah eastward:
<sup>2</sup> Sihon, the king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is upon the edge of the valley of Arnon, and in the midst of the valley, and half of Gilead, even unto the brook Jabbok, the border of the children of Ammon;
<sup>3</sup> And the Arabah unto the sea of Chinnereth eastward, and unto the sea of Arabah, the Salt Sea eastward, the way unto Beth-ashimoth, and from Teiman, which is under Ashdoth-pisgah.
<sup>4</sup> And the border of Og, king of Bashan, who remained of the Giants, who dwelt in Astaroth and in Edrein,
<sup>5</sup> and ruled from Mount Hermon, and from Salecah, and all Bashan unto the borders of Geshuri, and Machathi, and half Gilead, unto the borders of Sihon king of Heshbon.
<sup>6</sup> Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israel smote them; and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it for an inheritance unto Reuben, and unto Gad, and unto the half-tribe of Manasseh.
<sup>7</sup> And these are the kings of the Amorites, whom Joshua and the children of Israel slew beyond Jordan, by the sea of Baal-gad in the plain of Lebanon, and even unto the [mountain of]
