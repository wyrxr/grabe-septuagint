14 οὐκ ἀποθανεῖται. Καὶ λήψεται ἀπὸ τοῦ αἵματος τοῦ μόσχου,
    καὶ ῥανεῖ τῷ δακτύλῳ αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὸ ἱλαστήριον κατ᾽ ἀνατολὰς· κατὰ
    πρόσωπον τοῦ ἱλαστηρίου ῥανεῖ ἑπτάκις ἀπὸ τοῦ αἵματος τῷ δακτύ-
15 λῳ. Καὶ σφάξει τὸν χίμαρον τὸν περὶ τῆς ἁμαρτίας, τὸν περὶ
    τοῦ λαοῦ ἔναντι Κυρίου· καὶ οἴσει (ἀπὸ) τοῦ αἵματος αὐτοῦ ἔσω τοῦ
    καταπετάσματος, καὶ ποιήσει τὸ αἷμα αὐτοῦ, ὃν τρόπον
    ἐποίησε τὸ αἷμα τοῦ μόσχου· καὶ ῥανεῖ τὸ αἷμα αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὸ
16 ἱλαστήριον, κατὰ πρόσωπον τοῦ ἱλαστηρίου. Καὶ ἐξιλάσεται τὸ ἅ-
    γιον ἀπὸ τῶν ἀκαθαρσιῶν τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ἀδι-
    κημάτων αὐτῶν περὶ πασῶν τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν αὐτῶν· καὶ οὕτω
    ποιήσει τῇ σκηνῇ τοῦ μαρτυρίου, τῇ ἐκτισμένῃ ἐν αὐτοῖς ἐν μέσῳ
17 τῆς ἀκαθαρσίας αὐτῶν. Καὶ πᾶς ἄνθρωπος οὐκ ἔσται ἐν τῇ σκηνῇ
    τοῦ μαρτυρίου, εἰσπορευμένου αὐτοῦ ἐξιλάσασθαι ἐν τῷ ἁγίῳ, ἕως
    ἂν ἐξέλθῃ· καὶ ἐξιλάσεται περὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ, καὶ
18 περὶ πάσης συναγωγῆς (υἱῶν) Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἐξελεύσεται ἐπὶ τὸ
    θυσιαστήριον τὸ ὂν ἀπέναντι Κυρίου, καὶ ἐξιλάσεται ἐπ᾽ αὐτοῦ· καὶ
    λήψεται ἀπὸ τοῦ αἵματος τοῦ μόσχου, καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ αἵματος τοῦ
19 χιμάρου, καὶ ἐπιθήσει ἐπὶ τὰ κέρατα τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου κύκλῳ· καὶ
    ῥανεῖ ἐπ᾽ αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τοῦ αἵματος τῷ δακτύλῳ αὐτοῦ ἑπτάκις, καὶ
    καθαριεῖ αὐτό, καὶ ἁγιάσει αὐτὸ ἀπὸ τῶν ἀκαθαρσιῶν υἱῶν Ἰσ-
20 ραήλ. Καὶ συντελέσει ἐξιλασκόμενος τὸ ἅγιον, καὶ τὴν σκηνὴν
    τοῦ μαρτυρίου, καὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον, καὶ περὶ τῶν ἱερέων καθαριεῖ·
21 καὶ προσάξει (Ἀαρὼν) τὸν χίμαρον τὸν ζῶντα· καὶ ἐπιθήσει Ἀα-
    ρὼν τὰς δύο χεῖρας αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν τοῦ χιμάρου τοῦ
    ζῶντος, καὶ ἐξαγορεύσει ἐπ᾽ αὐτοῦ πάσας τὰς ἀνομίας τῶν υἱῶν
    Ἰσραήλ, καὶ πάσας τὰς ἀδικίας αὐτῶν, καὶ πάσας τὰς ἁμαρτίας αὐ-
    τῶν· καὶ ἐπιθήσει αὐτὰς ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν τοῦ χιμάρου τοῦ ζῶντος,
22 καὶ ἐξαποστελεῖ ἐν χειρὶ ἀνθρώπου ἑτοίμου εἰς τὴν ἔρημον· καὶ
    λήψεται ὁ χίμαρος ἐφ᾽ ἑαυτῷ τὰς ἀδικίας αὐτῶν εἰς γῆν ἄβατον·
23 καὶ ἐξαποστελεῖ τὸν χίμαρον εἰς τὴν ἔρημον. Καὶ εἰσελεύσεται
    Ἀαρὼν εἰς τὴν σκηνὴν τοῦ μαρτυρίου, καὶ ἐκδύσεται τὴν στολὴν
    τὴν λινῆν, ἣν ἐνδέδυκει εἰσπορευμένου αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸ ἅγιον, καὶ
24 ἀποθήσει αὐτὴν ἐκεῖ· καὶ λούσεται τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ ὕδατι ἐν τό-
    πῳ ἁγίῳ, καὶ ἐνδύσεται τὴν στολὴν αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐξελθὼν ποιήσει
    τὸ ὁλοκάρπωμα αὐτοῦ καὶ τὸ ὁλοκάρπωμα τοῦ λαοῦ, καὶ ἐξιλά-

14 shall not die. And he shall take of the blood of the calf,
    and shall sprinkle with his finger upon the mercy seat toward the east;
    before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle seven times of the blood with his finger.
15 And he shall slay the goat of the sin offering, that is for the people,
    before the Lord; and he shall bring [some] of its blood within the veil,
    and he shall do with its blood in such wise as he did with the blood of the calf;
    and he shall sprinkle its blood upon the mercy seat, before the mercy seat.
16 And he shall make atonement for the holy place,
    from the uncleannesses of the children of Israel,
    and from their unrighteousnesses concerning all their sins;
    and thus shall he do for the tabernacle of witness,
    which is pitched among them in the midst of their uncleanness.
17 And no man shall be in the tabernacle of witness
    when he entereth in to make atonement in the holy place, until he come forth;
    and he shall make atonement for himself and for his house,
    and for all the congregation of [the children of] Israel.
18 And he shall go out unto the altar that is before the Lord,
    and he shall make atonement for it;
    and he shall take of the blood of the calf, and of the blood of the goat,
19 and shall put it upon the horns of the altar round about;
    and he shall sprinkle upon it of the blood with his finger seven times,
    and shall cleanse it, and shall hallow it from the uncleannesses of the children of Israel.
20 And when he hath completed making atonement for the holy place,
    and the tabernacle of witness, and the altar,
    then shall he cleanse concerning the priests;
21 and [Aaron] shall bring the live goat;
    and Aaron shall lay his two hands upon the head of the live goat,
    and shall confess upon it all the iniquities of the children of Israel,
    and all their unrighteousnesses, and all their sins;
    and he shall lay them upon the head of the live goat,
22 and shall send it away by the hand of a man ready into the wilderness;
    and the goat shall take upon itself their unrighteousnesses unto a land uninhabited;
23 and he shall send away the goat into the wilderness.
    And Aaron shall go into the tabernacle of witness,
24 and shall put off the linen garment,
    which he had worn when he went into the holy place,
    and shall lay it aside there; and he shall wash his body with water in a holy place,
    and shall put on his [own] garment;
    and he shall come forth and shall offer his burnt offering and the burnt offering of the people,
    and shall make atonement for himself and for his house, and for the people, [as]
