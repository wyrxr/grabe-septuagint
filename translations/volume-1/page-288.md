14 Λέγει δὲ ἀδελφός σου ᾿Ισραήλ· σὺ ἐπίστῃ πάντα τὸν μόχθον τὸν εὑρόντα ἡμᾶς·
15 καὶ κατέβησαν οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν εἰς Αἴγυπτον, καὶ παροξύναμεν εἰς Αἴγυπτον, καὶ ἐκάκωσαν ἡμᾶς οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι ἡμέρας πλείους, καὶ τοὺς πατέρας ἡμῶν·
16 καὶ ἀνεβοήσαμεν πρὸς Κύριον, καὶ εἰσήκουσε Κύριος τῆς φωνῆς ἡμῶν, καὶ ἀποστείλας ἄγγελον, ἐξήγαγεν ἡμᾶς ἐξ Αἰγύπτου·
17 καὶ νῦν ἐσμεν ἐν Κάδης πόλει, ἐκ μέσου τῶν ὁρίων σου. Παρελευσόμεθα δὴ διὰ τῆς γῆς σου· οὐ διελευόμεθα δι᾿ ἀγρῶν, οὐδὲ δι᾿ ἀμπελώνων, οὐδὲ πιόμεθα ὕδωρ ἐκ λάκκου σου·
18 ὁδῷ βασιλικῇ πορευσόμεθα, οὐκ ἐκκλίνομεν δεξιά, οὐδὲ εὐώνυμα, ἕως ἂν παρέλθωμεν τὰ ὅριά σου. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτὸν ᾿Εδώμ· οὐ διελεύσῃ δι᾿ ἐμοῦ· εἰ δὲ μή, ἐν πολέμῳ ἐξελεύσομαι εἰς συνάντησίν σοι.
19 Καὶ λέγουσιν αὐτῷ οἱ υἱοὶ ᾿Ισραήλ· παρὰ τὸ ὄρος παρελευσόμεθα· ἐὰν δὲ τοῦ ὕδατός σου πίωμεν ἐγώ τε καὶ τὰ κτήνη μου, δώσω τιμήν σοι· ἀλλὰ τὸ πρᾶγμα οὐδέν ἐστι· παρὰ τὸ ὄρος πορευόμεθα.
20 ῾Ο δὲ εἶπεν· οὐ διελεύσῃ δι᾿ ἐμοῦ. Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ᾿Εδώμ εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτοῦ ἐν ὄχλῳ βαρεί, ἐν χειρὶ ἰσχυρᾷ·
21 καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησεν ᾿Εδώμ δοῦναι τῷ ᾿Ισραὴλ παρελθεῖν διὰ τῶν ὁρίων αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐξέκλινεν ᾿Ισραὴλ ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ.
22 Καὶ ἀπῆραν ἐκ Κάδης, καὶ παρεγένοντο οἱ υἱοὶ ᾿Ισραήλ, πᾶσα ἡ συναγωγή, εἰς ῞Ωρ τὸ ὄρος.
23 Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν καὶ ᾿Ααρὼν ἐν ῞Ωρ τῷ ὄρει ἐπὶ τῶν ὁρίων γῆς ᾿Εδώμ, λέγων·
24 προστεθήτω ᾿Ααρὼν πρὸς τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ, ὅτι οὐ μὴ εἰσέλθητε εἰς τὴν γῆν, ἣν ἔδωκα τοῖς υἱοῖς ᾿Ισραήλ (ἐν κατασχέσει), διότι παρωξυνάτε με ἐπὶ τοῦ ὕδατος τῆς λοιδορίας.
25 Λάβε τὸν ᾿Ααρὼν τὸν ἀδελφόν σου, καὶ ᾿Ελεάζαρ τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀναβίβασον αὐτοὺς εἰς ῞Ωρ τὸ ὄρος ἐναντίον πάσης τῆς συναγωγῆς·
26 καὶ ἔκδυσον ᾿Ααρὼν τὴν στολὴν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔνδυσον ᾿Ελεάζαρ τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ᾿Ααρὼν προστεθείς, ἀποθανέτω ἐκεῖ.
27 Καὶ ἐποίησε Μωυσῆς, καθὰ συνέταξε Κύριος αὐτῷ· καὶ ἀνεβίβασεν αὐτοὺς εἰς ῞Ωρ τὸ ὄρος ἐναντίον πάσης τῆς συναγωγῆς.
28 Καὶ ἐξέδυσε Μωυσῆς τὸν ᾿Ααρὼν τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐνέδυσεν αὐτὰ ᾿Ελεάζαρ τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἀπέθανεν ᾿Ααρὼν ἐκεῖ ἐπὶ τῆς κορυφῆς τοῦ ὄρους.
29 Καὶ κατέβη Μωυσῆς καὶ ᾿Ελεάζαρ ἐκ τοῦ ὄρους. Καὶ ἴδε πᾶσα ἡ συναγωγή, ὅτι ἀπελύθη ᾿Ααρών· καὶ ἐκλαυσαν τὸν ᾿Ααρὼν τριάκοντα ἡμέρας πᾶς οἶκος ᾿Ισραήλ.

### NUMBERS. CHAPTER XX.

**14** Thus saith thy brother Israel: Thou art aware of all the travail that hath befallen us.
**15** And our fathers went down into Egypt, and we provoked [Him] in Egypt, and the Egyptians afflicted us for many days, yea, and our fathers [likewise].
**16** And we cried unto the Lord, and the Lord heard our voice, and sent an angel, and brought us forth out of Egypt.
**17** And now we be in Kadesh, a city, from the midst of thy borders. So then, we shall pass through thy land; we shall not pass through fields, nor through vineyards, nor shall we drink water from thy well.
**18** By the king's highway shall we journey; we shall not turn aside to the right hand, nor to the left, until we have passed beyond thy borders. And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass through me; and if not, I will go forth to meet thee with war.
**19** And the sons of Israel said unto him, We shall pass alongside the mountain; and if I and my livestock drink of thy water, I will give thee a price [for it]; but this matter is of no consequence; we journey alongside the mountain.
**20** But he said, Thou shalt not pass through me. And Edom came forth to meet him with a great multitude, with a strong hand.
**21** And Edom would not suffer Israel to pass through his borders; and Israel turned aside from him.
**22** And they journeyed from Kadesh, and the sons of Israel, even the whole assembly, came unto Mount Hor.
**23** And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in Mount Hor, on the borders of the land of Edom, saying,
**24** Let Aaron be gathered unto his people, because ye shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the sons of Israel (as a possession), because ye provoked Me at the water of contention.
**25** Take Aaron thy brother, and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto Mount Hor before the whole assembly;
**26** and strip Aaron of his sacred vestments, and clothe Eleazar his son therewith; and Aaron, having been gathered unto his people, shall die there.
**27** And Moses did as the Lord commanded him; and he brought them up unto Mount Hor before the whole assembly.
**28** And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and clothed Eleazar his son with them; and Aaron died there on the top of the mountain.
**29** And Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain. And behold, all the assembly saw that Aaron was released from life; and all the house of Israel wept for Aaron thirty days.
