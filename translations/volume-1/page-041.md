22 ἑτέρῳ. Συνετέλεσε δὲ λαλῶν πρὸς αὐτόν, καὶ ἀνέβη ὁ Θεὸς ἀπὸ ᾽Α-
23 βραάμ. Καὶ ἔλαβεν ᾽Αβραὰμ ᾽Ισμαὴλ τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντας
    τοὺς οἰκογενεῖς αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντας τοὺς ἀργυρωνήτους, καὶ πᾶν ἄρ-
    σεν τῶν ἀνδρῶν τῶν ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ ᾽Αβραάμ, καὶ περιέτεμε τὴν σάρ-
    κα τῆς ἀκροβυστίας αὐτῶν ἐν τῷ καιρῷ τῆς ἡμέρας ἐκείνης, καθὰ
24 ἐλάλησεν αὐτῷ ὁ Θεός. ᾽Αβραὰμ δὲ ἦν ἐνενηκονταεννέα ἐτῶν, ἡνί-
25 κα περιέτεμε τὴν σάρκα τῆς ἀκροβυστίας αὐτοῦ. ᾽Ισμαὴλ δὲ ὁ υἱὸς
    αὐτοῦ ἐτῶν δεκατριῶν ἦν, ἡνίκα περιετμήθη τὴν σάρκα τῆς ἀκρο-
26 βυστίας αὐτοῦ. ᾽Εν τῷ καιρῷ τῆς ἡμέρας ἐκείνης περιετμήθη ᾽Α-
27 βραάμ, καὶ ᾽Ισμαὴλ ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντες οἱ ἄνδρες τοῦ οἴκου
    αὐτοῦ, καὶ οἱ οἰκογενεῖς, καὶ οἱ ἀργυρώνητοι ἐξ ἀλλογενῶν ἐθνῶν,
    περιέτεμεν αὐτούς.

1  ὩΦΘΗ δὲ αὐτῷ ὁ Θεὸς πρὸς τῇ δρυῒ τῇ Μαμβρῇ, καθημένου
2  αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τῆς θύρας τῆς σκηνῆς αὐτοῦ μεσημβρίας. ᾽Αναβλέψας δὲ
   τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτοῦ ἴδε, καὶ ἰδοὺ τρεῖς ἄνδρες εἰστήκεισαν ἐπάνω
   αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἰδών, προσέδραμεν εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτοῖς ἀπὸ τῆς
3  θύρας τῆς σκηνῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ προσεκύνησεν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν. Καὶ εἶπε·
   Κύριε, εἰ ἄρα εὗρον χάριν ἐναντίον σου, μὴ παρέλθῃς τὸν παῖδά
4  σου. Ληφθήτω δὴ ὕδωρ, καὶ νίψατε τοὺς πόδας ὑμῶν, καὶ κατα-
5  ψύξατε ὑπὸ τὸ δένδρον· καὶ λήψομαι ἄρτον, καὶ φάγεσθε, καὶ μετὰ
   τοῦτο παρελεύσεσθε (εἰς τὴν ὁδὸν ὑμῶν), οὗ εἵνεκεν ἐξεκλίνατε πρὸς
6  τὸν παῖδα ὑμῶν. Καὶ εἶπαν· οὕτω ποίησον, καθὼς εἴρηκας. Καὶ
   ἔσπευσεν ᾽Αβραὰμ ἐπὶ τὴν σκηνὴν πρὸς Σάρῥαν, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ·
   σπεῦσον, καὶ φύρασον τρία μέτρα σεμιδάλεως, καὶ ποίησον ἐγκρυφίας.
7  Καὶ εἰς τὰς βόας ἔδραμεν ᾽Αβραάμ, καὶ ἔλαβε μοσχάριον ἀπαλὸν
   καὶ καλόν, καὶ ἔδωκε τῷ παιδί, καὶ ἐτάχυνε τοῦ ποιῆσαι αὐτό.
8  ῎Ελαβε δὲ βούτυρον καὶ γάλα καὶ τὸ μοσχάριον ὃ ἐποίησε, καὶ
   παρέθηκεν αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἐφάγοσαν· αὐτὸς δὲ παρειστήκει αὐτοῖς ὑπὸ
9  τὸ δένδρον. Εἶπον δὲ πρὸς αὐτόν· ποῦ Σάρῥα ἡ
10 γυνή σου; Ὁ δὲ ἀποκριθείς, εἶπεν· ἰδοὺ ἐν τῇ σκηνῇ. Εἶπε δὲ·
   ἐπαναστρέφων ἥξω πρὸς σὲ κατὰ τὸν καιρὸν τοῦτον εἰς ὥρας, καὶ
   ἕξει υἱὸν Σάρῥα ἡ γυνή σου. Σάρῥα δὲ ἤκουσε πρὸς τῇ θύρᾳ τῆς
11 σκηνῆς, οὖσα ὄπισθεν αὐτοῦ. ᾽Αβραὰμ δὲ καὶ Σάρῥα πρεσβύτεροι,

**Genesis 17**

22 to another. And when He had finished speaking with him, God ascended from Abraham.
23 And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all those born in his house, and all those bought with silver, and every male among the men who were in the house of Abraham; and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskins on that selfsame day, as God had spoken unto him.
24 Now Abraham was ninety-and-nine years old, when he circumcised the flesh of his foreskin.
25 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
26 On that selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son,
27 and all the men of his house, and the homeborn, and those bought with silver from foreign nations, he circumcised them.

**Genesis 18**

1 Now the Lord appeared unto him by the oak of Mamre, as he sat at the door of his tent in the noontide heat.
2 And lifting up his eyes, he looked, and lo, three men stood by him. And when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the door of his tent, and bowed himself to the ground.
3 And he said, "My Lord, if now I have found grace in Thy sight, do not pass away from Thy servant.
4 Let now a little water, I pray, be brought, and wash your feet, and refresh yourselves beneath the tree;
5 and I shall fetch a morsel of bread, and ye shall eat, and after that ye shall pass on (unto your way), forasmuch as ye have turned aside unto your servant." And they said, "So do, as thou hast said."
6 And Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah, and said unto her, "Make haste, and knead three measures of choice meal, and make hearth-cakes."
7 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and took a tender calf and a good one, and gave it unto the young man, and he made haste to prepare it.
8 And he took curds and milk and the calf which he had prepared, and set it before them; and they did eat. And he himself stood by them under the tree.
9 And they said unto him, "Where is Sarah thy wife?" And he answered, saying, "Behold, she is in the tent."
10 And he said, "I will surely return unto thee at this time next year, and Sarah thy wife shall have a son." And Sarah heard it at the door of the tent, which was behind him.
11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old,
