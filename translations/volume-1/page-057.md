22 αὐτοῦ. Ἐσκίρτων δὲ τὰ παιδία ἐν αὐτῇ. Εἶπε δέ· εἰ οὕτω μοι
23 μέλλει γίνεσθαι, ἵνα τί μοι τοῦτο; ἐπορεύθη δὲ πυθέσθαι παρὰ Κυρίου.
24 Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος αὐτῇ· δύο ἔθνη ἐν τῇ γαστρί σου εἰσί, καὶ δύο λαοὶ ἐκ τῆς κοιλίας σου διασταλήσονται· καὶ λαὸς λαοῦ ὑπερέξει, καὶ ὁ μείζων δουλεύσει τῷ ἐλάσσονι.
25 Καὶ ἐπληρώθησαν αἱ ἡμέραι τοῦ τεκεῖν αὐτήν, καὶ τῆδε ἦν δίδυμα ἐν τῇ γαστρὶ αὐτῆς.
26 Ἐξῆλθε δὲ ὁ υἱὸς ὁ πρωτότοκος πυῤῥάκης, ὅλος, ὡσεὶ δορὰ, δασύς· ἐπωνόμασε δὲ τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ, Ἠσαῦ. Καὶ μετὰ τοῦτο ἐξῆλθεν ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἡ χεὶρ αὐτοῦ ἐπειλημμένη τῆς πτέρνης Ἠσαῦ· καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ, Ἰακώβ. Ἰσαὰκ δὲ ἦν ἐτῶν ἑξήκοντα, ὅτε ἐγέννησεν αὐτοὺς Ῥεβέκκα.
28 Ηὐξήθησαν δὲ οἱ νεανίσκοι· καὶ ἦν Ἠσαῦ ἄνθρωπος εἰδὼς κυνηγεῖν, ἀγροῖκος· Ἰακὼβ δὲ ἦν ἄνθρωπος ἄπλαστος, οἰκῶν οἰκίαν.
29 Ἠγάπησε δὲ Ἰσαὰκ τὸν Ἠσαῦ, ὅτι ἡ θήρα αὐτοῦ βρῶσις αὐτῷ· Ῥεβέκκα δὲ ἠγάπα τὸν Ἰακώβ.
30 Ἤψησε δὲ Ἰακὼβ ἕψεμα· ἦλθε δὲ Ἠσαῦ ἐκ τοῦ πεδίου, ἐκλείπων. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἠσαῦ τῷ Ἰακώβ· γεῦσόν με ἀπὸ τοῦ ἐψήματος τοῦ πυῤῥοῦ τούτου, ὅτι ἐκλείπω ἐγώ.
31 Διὰ τοῦτο ἐκλήθη τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ, Ἐδώμ. Εἶπε δὲ Ἰακὼβ τῷ Ἠσαῦ· ἀπόδου μοι σήμερον τὰ πρωτοτόκιά σου (ἐμοί).
32 Εἶπε δὲ Ἠσαῦ· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ πορεύομαι τελευτᾶν, καὶ ἵνα τί μοι ταῦτα τὰ πρωτοτοκεῖα;
33 Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Ἰακώβ· ὄμοσόν μοι σήμερον. Καὶ ὤμοσεν αὐτῷ· ἀπέδοτο δὲ Ἠσαῦ τὰ πρωτοτοκεῖα αὐτοῦ τῷ Ἰακώβ.
34 Ἰακὼβ δὲ ἔδωκε τῷ Ἠσαῦ ἄρτον καὶ ἕψεμα φακοῦ, καὶ ἔφαγε καὶ ἔπιε, καὶ ἀναστὰς ᾤχετο· καὶ ἐφαύλισεν Ἠσαῦ τὰ πρωτοτοκεῖα.

**ΚΕΦ. ΚϚ´. XXVI.**

1 ΕΓΕΝΕΤΟ δὲ λιμὸς ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, χωρὶς τοῦ λιμοῦ τοῦ πρότερον, ὃς ἐγενήθη ἐν τῷ χρόνῳ τοῦ Ἀβραάμ· ἐπορεύθη δὲ Ἰσαὰκ πρὸς Ἀβιμέλεχ βασιλέα Φυλιστιεὶμ εἰς Γέραρα.
2 Ὤφθη δὲ αὐτῷ Κύριος, καὶ εἶπε· μὴ καταβῇς εἰς Αἴγυπτον, κατοίκησον δὲ
3 ἐν τῇ γῇ, ἢ ἄν σοι εἴπω, καὶ παροίκει ἐν τῇ γῇ ταύτῃ, καὶ ἔσομαι μετὰ σοῦ, καὶ εὐλογήσω σε· σοὶ γὰρ καὶ τῷ σπέρματί σου δώσω πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν ταύτην, καὶ στήσω τὸν ὅρκον μου, ὃν ὤμοσα τῷ Ἀβραὰμ τῷ πατρί σου·
4 καὶ πληθυνῶ τὸ σπέρμα σου ὡς τοὺς ἀστέρας τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ δώσω τῷ σπέρματί σου πᾶσαν

**Chapter 25**
***
22 [within] her. And the children leaped within her. And she said, "If thus it is to befall me, wherefore [is] this unto me?" And she went forth to inquire of the Lord.
24 And the Lord said unto her, "Two nations are within thy womb, and two peoples shall be divided from thy belly; and one people shall be superior to the other, and the elder shall serve the younger."
25 And when her days to give birth were fulfilled, then, behold, therein were twins in her womb.
26 And the firstborn son came forth, ruddy, and wholly as a hide, hairy. And he named his name Esau. And after this came forth his brother, and his hand was grasping the heel of Esau. And he called his name Jacob. And Isaac was sixty years old when Rebekah bore them.
28 And the lads grew; and Esau was a man skilled to hunt, a man of the field; but Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in a house.
29 And Isaac loved Esau, for his game was [his] food; but Rebekah loved Jacob.
30 And Jacob boiled a stew; and Esau came from the field, being faint. And Esau said unto Jacob, "Pray thee, give me to eat of this red stew, for I am faint."
31 Therefore was his name called Edom. And Jacob said unto Esau, "Sell me this day thy birthright [unto me]."
32 And Esau said, "Behold, I am going to die; and what profit [then] are these birthrights unto me?"
33 And Jacob said unto him, "Swear unto me this day." And he swore unto him; and Esau sold his birthrights unto Jacob.
34 And Jacob gave Esau bread and stew of lentils; and he ate and he drank, and arose and departed. And Esau despised his birthrights.

**Chapter 26**
***
1 Now there was a famine in the land, apart from the former famine which occurred in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech, king of the Philistines, unto Gerar.
2 And the Lord appeared unto him, and said, "Go not down into Egypt. Dwell rather
3 in the land of which I shall tell thee, and sojourn in this land; and I will be with thee, and I will bless thee. For unto thee and to thy seed will I give all this land, and I will establish My oath which I swore to Abraham thy father;
4 and I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and I will give unto thy seed all"
