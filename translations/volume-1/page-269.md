254 ΑΡΙΘΜΟΙ· ΚΕΦ. ΙΑ·
ἐπίμικτος δ᾽ ἐν αὐτοῖς ἐπεθύμησεν ἐπιθυμίαν, καὶ καθίσαντες ἔκλαιον
5 καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ εἶπαν· τίς ἡμᾶς ψωμιεῖ κρέα; ἐμνήσθη-
μεν τοὺς ἰχθύας, οὓς ἠσθίομεν ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ δωρεάν, καὶ τοὺς
σίκυας, καὶ τοὺς πέπονας, καὶ τὰ πράσα, καὶ τὰ κρόμμυα, καὶ
6 τὰ σκόρδα· νυνὶ δὲ ἡ ψυχὴ ἡμῶν κατάξηρος, οὐδὲν πλὴν εἰς τὸ
7 μάννα οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ ἡμῶν. Τὸ δὲ μάννα ὡσεὶ σπέρμα κορίου ἐστί,
8 καὶ τὸ εἶδος αὐτοῦ ὡς εἶδος κρυστάλλου. Καὶ διεπορεύετο ὁ λαός,
καὶ συνέλεγον, καὶ ἔπληθον αὐτὸ ἐν τῷ μύλῳ, καὶ ἔτριβον ἐν τῇ
θυΐᾳ, καὶ ἥψουν αὐτὸ ἐν τῇ χύτρᾳ, καὶ ἐποίουν αὐτὸ ἐγκρυφίας·
9 καὶ ἦν ἡ ἡδονὴ αὐτοῦ ὡσεὶ γεύμα ἐγκρὶς ἐξ ἐλαίου. Καὶ ὅταν
κατέβη ἡ δρόσος ἐπὶ τὴν παρεμβολὴν νυκτός, κατέβαινε τὸ μάννα
10 ἐπ᾽ αὐτῆς. Καὶ ἤκουσε Μωυσῆς κλαιόντων αὐτῶν, κατὰ δήμους
αὐτῶν ἕκαστος κατὰ τὴν θύραν τῆς σκηνῆς αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐθυμώθη
11 ὀργῇ Κύριος σφόδρα, καὶ ἔναντι Μωυσῆ ἦν πονηρόν. Καὶ εἶπε Μω-
υσῆς πρὸς Κύριον· ἵνατί ἐκάκωσας τὸν θεράποντά σου; καὶ διατί
οὐχ εὕρηκα χάριν ἐναντίον σου, ἐπιθεῖναι τὴν ὁρμὴν παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ
12 τούτου ἐπ᾽ ἐμέ; μὴ ἐγὼ ἐν γαστρὶ ἔλαβον τὸν πάντα λαὸν τοῦτον,
ἢ ἐγὼ τέτοκα αὐτούς, ὅτι λέγεις μοι· λάβε αὐτὸν εἰς τὸν κόλ-
πον σου, ὡσεὶ ἄραι τιθηνὸς τὸν θηλάζοντα, εἰς γῆν, ἣν ὤμοσας
13 τοῖς πατράσιν αὐτῶν; πόθεν μοι κρέα, δοῦναι παντὶ τῷ λαῷ τού-
τῳ; ὅτι κλαίουσιν ἐπ᾽ ἐμέ, λέγοντες· δὸς ἡμῖν κρέα, ἵνα φάγω-
14 μεν. Οὐ δυνήσομαι ἐγὼ μόνος φέρειν πάντα τὸν λαὸν τοῦτον, ὅτι
15 βαρύ μοι ἐστὶ τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο. Εἰ δ᾽ οὕτω σὺ ποιεῖς μοι, ἀποκτεί-
νόν με ἀναιρέσει, εἰ εὕρηκα ἔλεος παρὰ σοί, ἵνα μὴ ἴδω τὴν κα-
16 κωσίν μου. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν· συνάγαγέ μοι ἑβδομή-
κοντα ἄνδρας ἀπὸ τῶν πρεσβυτέρων Ἰσραήλ, οὓς σὺ αὐτὸς οἶδας,
ὅτι οὗτοι εἰσι πρεσβύτεροι τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ γραμματεῖς αὐτῶν· καὶ
ἄξεις αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν σκηνὴν τοῦ μαρτυρίου, καὶ στήσονται ἐκεῖ με-
17 τὰ σοῦ. Καὶ καταβήσομαι, καὶ λαλήσω ἐκεῖ μετὰ σοῦ, καὶ ἀφελῶ
ἀπὸ τοῦ πνεύματος τοῦ ἐπὶ σοί, καὶ ἐπιθήσω ἐπ᾽ αὐτούς· καὶ συν-
αντιλήψονται μετὰ σοῦ τὴν ὁρμὴν τοῦ λαοῦ, καὶ οὐκ οἴσεις αὐτοὺς
18 σὺ μόνος. Καὶ τῷ λαῷ ἐρεῖς· ἁγνίσασθε εἰς αὔριον, καὶ φάγε-
σθε κρέα, ὅτι ἐκλαύσατε ἔναντι Κυρίου, λέγοντες· τίς ἡμᾶς ψω-
μιεῖ κρέα; ὅτι καλὸν ἡμῖν ἐστιν ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ· καὶ δώσει Κύριος
19 ὑμῖν κρέα φαγεῖν, καὶ φάγεσθε (κρέα). Οὐχ ἡμέραν μίαν φάγε-
σθε, οὐδὲ δύο ἡμέρας, οὐδὲ πέντε ἡμέρας, οὐδὲ δέκα ἡμέρας, οὐ-

### A Faithful and Literary Translation

#### Numbers, Chapter 11

**4** Now the mixed multitude that was among them fell a-lusting with a great longing; and they sat down and wept.
**5** And the children of Israel also wept again, and said, "Who shall feed us with flesh? We do remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; also the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and
**6** the garlic. But now our soul is utterly withered, for there is naught but the manna before our eyes."
**7** Now the manna was as it were coriander seed,
**8** and the appearance thereof was as the appearance of crystal. And the people went about, and gathered it, and did grind it in the mill, or beat it in the mortar, and did boil it in the pot, and did make thereof cakes baked in the ashes.
**9** And the taste thereof was as the taste of a cake [prepared] with oil. And when the dew fell upon the camp by night, the manna descended upon it.

**10** And Moses heard the people weeping, throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent; and the Lord was very wroth with anger, and it was evil in the sight of Moses.
**11** And Moses said unto the Lord, "Wherefore hast Thou afflicted Thy servant? And wherefore have I not found favour in Thy sight, that Thou shouldest lay the burden of all this people upon me?
**12** Have I conceived all this people in the womb? Or have I begotten them, that Thou sayest unto me, 'Carry him in thy bosom, as a nurse beareth the suckling child, unto the land which Thou hast sworn
**13** unto their fathers?' Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? For they weep upon me, saying, 'Give us flesh, that we may eat!'
**14** I am not able alone to bear all this people; for
**15** this burden is too heavy for me. And if Thou thus dealest with me, kill me, I pray Thee, with a slaughter, if I have found mercy in Thy sight; that I may not see my wretchedness."

**16** And the Lord said unto Moses, "Gather unto Me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou thyself knowest to be the elders of the people and their scribes; and thou shalt bring them unto the tabernacle of testimony, and they shall stand there
**17** with thee. And I will come down and speak there with thee, and I will take of the Spirit that is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear with thee the burden of the people, and thou shalt not bear it alone.
**18** And unto the people thou shalt say, 'Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, and ye shall eat flesh; for ye have wept before the Lord, saying, 'Who shall feed us with flesh? For it was good for us in Egypt.' And the Lord shall give
**19** unto you flesh to eat, and ye shall eat [flesh]. Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, nor ten days, nor
