ἀργυρίου, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὸ τῷ χωνευτῇ, καὶ ἐποίησεν αὐτὸ γλυ-
πτὸν καὶ χωνευτόν· καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ Μειχά. Καὶ ὁ ἀνὴρ 5
Μειχὰ αὐτῷ οἶκος Θεοῦ, καὶ ἐποίησεν Ἐφούδ καὶ Θεραφείμ· καὶ
ἐνέπλησε τὴν χεῖρα ἑνὸς τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐγενήθη αὐτῷ εἰς
ἱερέα. Ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις οὐκ ἦν βασιλεὺς ἐν Ἰσραήλ· ἀνὴρ 6
τὸ εὐθὲς ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτοῦ ἐποίει. Καὶ ἐγένετο παιδάριον ἐκ 7
Βηθλεὲμ (δήμου) Ἰούδα, ἐκ τῆς συγγενείας Ἰούδα, καὶ αὐτὸς
Λευΐτης· καὶ αὐτὸς παρώκει ἐκεῖ. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη ὁ ἀνὴρ ἐκ τῆς 8
πόλεως Ἰούδα Βηθλεὲμ, παροικεῖν οὗ ἐὰν εὕρῃ· καὶ ἐγενήθη εἰς
ὄρος Ἐφραΐμ ἕως οἴκου Μειχά, τοῦ ποιῆσαι τὴν ὁδὸν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ 9
εἶπεν αὐτῷ Μειχά· πόθεν ἔρχῃ; Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτόν· Λευΐτης
ἐγώ εἰμι ἐκ Βηθλεὲμ δήμου Ἰούδα, ἐκ τῆς συγγενείας Ἰούδα, καὶ ἐγὼ
πορεύομαι παροικεῖν οὗ ἐὰν εὕρω. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Μειχά· κάθου μετ᾽ 10
ἐμοῦ, καὶ γένου μοι εἰς πατέρα καὶ εἰς ἱερέα, καὶ ἐγὼ δώσω σοι δέκα
ἀργυρίου εἰς ἡμέρας, καὶ ζεῦγος ἱματίων, καὶ πρὸς τὸ ζῆν σου. Καὶ 11
ἐπορεύθη ὁ Λευΐτης, καὶ ἤρξατο παροικεῖν παρὰ τῷ ἀνδρί· καὶ
ἐγενήθη αὐτῷ τὸ παιδάριον ὡς εἷς τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐνέπλησε 12
Μειχὰ τὴν χεῖρα τοῦ Λευΐτου, καὶ ἐγενήθη αὐτῷ τὸ παιδάριον
εἰς ἱερέα· καὶ ἦν ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ Μειχά. Καὶ εἶπε Μειχά· νῦν 13
ἔγνων ὅτι ἠγαθοποίησέ με Κύριος, ὅτι ἐγενήθη μοι ὁ Λευΐτης
εἰς ἱερέα.

Ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις οὐκ ἦν βασιλεὺς ἐν Ἰσραήλ· καὶ 1
ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις ἐζήτει ἡ φυλὴ τοῦ Δὰν ἑαυτῇ κληρονο-
μίαν τοῦ κατοικεῖν, ὅτι οὐκ ἐνέπεσεν αὐτῇ ἕως τῶν ἡμερῶν ἐκείνων
ἐν μέσῳ φυλῶν Ἰσραὴλ κληρονομία. Καὶ ἐξαπέστειλαν οἱ υἱοὶ Δὰν 2
ἐκ τῶν συγγενῶν αὐτῶν πέντε ἄνδρας ἀπὸ μέρους αὐτῶν, ἄνδρας
υἱοὺς δυνάμεως ἐκ Σαραὰ καὶ Ἐσθαὼλ, τοῦ κατασκέψασθαι τὴν γῆν,
καὶ ἐξιχνιάσαι αὐτήν. Καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς αὐτούς· πορεύεσθε καὶ ἐξε-
ρευνήσατε τὴν γῆν. Καὶ παρεγένοντο εἰς ὄρος Ἐφραΐμ ἕως οἴ-
κου Μειχά, καὶ κατέπαυσαν ἐκεῖ. Αὐτῶν ὄντων παρὰ τῷ οἴκῳ 3
Μειχά, καὶ αὐτοὶ ἐπέγνωσαν τὴν φωνὴν τοῦ παιδαρίου (τοῦ νεωτέρου)
τοῦ Λευΐτου, καὶ ἐξέκλιναν ἐκεῖ, καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῷ· τίς ἤ-

### Judges Chapter 17

**4.** ...of silver, and gave it unto the founder; and he made thereof a graven image and a molten image, and it was in the house of Micah.

**5.** Now the man Micah had a house of God [for] himself, and he made an ephod and teraphim; and he consecrated one of his sons, and he became his priest.

**6.** In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did that which was right in his own eyes.

**7.** And there was a young man from Bethlehem (a town) of Judah, from the family of Judah; and he himself was a Levite, and he sojourned there.

**8.** And the man journeyed from the city of Judah, [even] Bethlehem, to sojourn wherever he might find [a place]. And he came to Mount Ephraim, unto the house of Micah, as he made his way.

**9.** And Micah said unto him, "Whence comest thou?" And he said unto him, "I am a Levite from Bethlehem, a town of Judah, from the family of Judah; and I journey to sojourn wherever I may find [a place]."

**10.** And Micah said unto him, "Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest; and I will give thee ten [pieces] of silver by the day, and a pair of garments, and [sustenance] for thy living."

**11.** And the Levite went [with him], and began to sojourn with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons.

**12.** And Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest; and he was in the house of Micah.

**13.** And Micah said, "Now know I that the Lord hath dealt graciously with me, because the Levite is become my priest."

### Judges Chapter 18

**1.** In those days there was no king in Israel; and in those days the tribe of Dan sought for itself an inheritance to dwell in, for there had fallen unto them no inheritance among the tribes of Israel until those days.

**2.** And the children of Dan sent forth from their families five men from their number, men [who were] sons of might, from Zorah and Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it out. And they said unto them, "Go ye, and search out the land." And they came to Mount Ephraim, unto the house of Micah, and they lodged there.

**3.** While they were by the house of Micah, they recognized the voice of the young man (the younger one), the Levite; and they turned aside thither, and said unto him, "Who brought thee hither? And what doest thou in this place? And what hast thou here?"

**4.** And he said unto them, "Thus and thus hath Micah done unto me, and hired me, and I am become his priest."
