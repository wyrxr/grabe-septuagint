ΛΕΥΙΤΙΚΟΝ ΚΕΦ. ΙΓ'.
τοῦ ἀκατακάλυπτος, καὶ περὶ τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ περιβεβλέσθω, καὶ
46 ἀκάθαρτος κεκλήσεται πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας, ὅσας ἂν ᾖ ἡ ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῦ
ἀφὴ, ἀκάθαρτος ὤν, ἀκάθαρτός ἐστι· κεχωρισμένος καθήσεται, ἔξω
47 τῆς παρεμβολῆς ἔσται αὐτοῦ ἡ διατριβή. Καὶ ἱματίῳ ἐὰν γέ-
νηται ἐν αὐτῷ ἀφὴ λέπρας, ἐν ἱματίῳ ἐρέῳ, ἢ ἐν ἱματίῳ στυπ-
48 πυΐνῳ, ἢ ἐν στήμονι, ἢ ἐν κρόκῃ, ἢ ἐν τοῖς λινοῖς, ἢ ἐν τοῖς
49 ἐρείοις, ἢ ἐν δέρματι, ἢ ἐν παντὶ ἐργασίμῳ δέρματι, καὶ γένηται
ἡ ἀφὴ χλωρίζουσα ἢ πυρρίζουσα ἐν τῷ δέρματι, ἢ ἐν τῷ ἱματίῳ,
50 ἢ ἐν τῷ στήμονι, ἢ ἐν τῇ κρόκῃ, ἢ ἐν παντὶ σκεύει ἐργασίμῳ
δέρματος, ἀφὴ λέπρας ἐστί· καὶ δείξει τῷ ἱερεῖ, καὶ ὄψεται ὁ ἱε-
51 ρεὺς τὴν ἀφὴν, καὶ ἀφοριεῖ ὁ ἱερεὺς τὴν ἀφὴν ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας, καὶ
ὄψεται ὁ ἱερεὺς τὴν ἀφὴν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ· ἐὰν δὲ διαχένηται
52 ἡ ἀφὴ ἐν τῷ ἱματίῳ, ἢ ἐν τῷ στήμονι, ἢ ἐν τῇ κρόκῃ, ἢ ἐν
τῷ δέρματι, κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἐὰν ποιηθῇ δέρματα ἐν τῇ ἐργα-
σίᾳ, λέπρα ἔμμονος ἔστιν ἡ ἀφὴ, ἀκάθαρτός ἐστι· κατακαύσει τὸ
53 ἱμάτιον, ἢ τὸν στήμονα, ἢ τὴν κρόκην ἐν τοῖς ἐρείοις, ἢ ἐν τοῖς
λινοῖς, ἢ ἐν παντὶ σκεύει δερματίνῳ, ἐν ᾧ ἐὰν γένηται ἡ ἀφὴ·
ὅτι λέπρα ἔμμονός ἐστιν, ἐν πυρὶ κατακαυθήσεται. Ἐὰν δὲ ἴδῃ ὁ
54 ἱερεὺς, καὶ μὴ διαχένηται ἡ ἀφὴ ἐν τῷ ἱματίῳ, ἢ ἐν τῷ στήμονι,
ἢ ἐν τῇ κρόκῃ, ἢ ἐν παντὶ σκεύει δερματίνῳ· καὶ συντάξει ὁ ἱε-
ρεὺς, καὶ πλυνεῖ ἐφ᾿ οὗ ἐὰν ᾖ ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἡ ἀφὴ, καὶ ἀφοριεῖ ὁ
55 ἱερεὺς τὴν ἀφὴν ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας τοῦ δεύτερον· καὶ ὄψεται ὁ ἱερεὺς με-
τὰ τὸ πλυθῆναι τὴν ἀφὴν, καὶ ἴδε μὴ μετέβαλε τὴν
ὄψιν ἡ ἀφὴ, καὶ ἡ ἀφὴ οὐ διαχένηται, ἀκάθαρτόν ἐστιν, ἐν πυρὶ
56 κατακαυθήσεται· ἐστήρικται ἐν τῷ ἱματίῳ, ἢ ἐν τῷ στήμονι, ἢ ἐν
τῇ κρόκῃ. Καὶ ἐὰν ἴδῃ ὁ ἱερεὺς, καὶ ἡ ἀμαυρὰ ἡ ἀφὴ μετὰ τὸ
πλυνθῆναι αὐτὸ, ἀποῤῥήξει αὐτὸ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἱματίου, ἢ ἀπὸ τοῦ δέρ-
57 ματος, ἢ ἀπὸ τοῦ στήμονος, ἢ ἀπὸ τῆς κρόκης. Ἐὰν δὲ ὀφθῇ ἔτι
ἐν τῷ ἱματίῳ, ἢ ἐν τῷ στήμονι, ἢ ἐν τῇ κρόκῃ, ἢ ἐν παντὶ
σκεύει δερματίνῳ, λέπρα ἐξανθοῦσά ἐστιν, ἐν πυρὶ κατακαυθήσεται:
58 ἐν ᾧ ἐστιν ἡ ἀφὴ. Καὶ τὸ ἱμάτιον, ἢ ὁ στήμων, ἢ ἡ κρόκη, ἢ
πᾶν σκεῦος δερματίνου, ὃ πλυθήσεται, καὶ ἀποστήσεται ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ
59 ἡ ἀφὴ, καὶ πλυθήσεται τοῦ δεύτερον, καὶ καθαρὸν ἔσται. Οὗτος ὁ
νόμος ἀφῆς λέπρας ἱματίου ἐρέου, ἢ στυππίνου, ἢ στήμονος, ἢ
κρόκης, ἢ παντὸς σκεύους δερματίνου, εἰς τὸ καθαρίσαι αὐτὸ, ἢ
μιᾶναι αὐτό.

**English Translation:**

### LEVITICUS CHAPTER 13

Of him that is uncovered, and about his mouth shall it be muffled;
46 And unclean shall he be called all the days wherein the affliction is upon him; being unclean, he is unclean. He shall dwell separated; outside the camp shall be his abode.

47 ¶ And if in a garment there be an affliction of leprosy, whether in a woollen garment, or in a flaxen garment,
48 Or in the warp, or in the woof; or in the linens, or in the wools;
49 Or in a skin, or in any work of skin; and if the affliction be greenish or reddish in the skin, or in the garment,
50 Or in the warp, or in the woof, or in any article wrought of skin, it is the affliction of leprosy. And he shall show it unto the priest; and the priest shall see the affliction,
51 And the priest shall separate the affliction for seven days. And the priest shall see the affliction on the seventh day: if the affliction be spread in the garment, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in the skin,
52 According to all that skins are wrought in the work, it is a persistent leprosy, it is unclean. He shall burn the garment, or the warp, or the woof, in the wools, or in the linens, or in any vessel made of skin, wherein the affliction shall be;
53 For it is a persistent leprosy, in fire shall it be burned.

¶ But if the priest sees, and the affliction is not spread in the garment, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in any vessel made of skin;
54 Then shall the priest command, and he shall wash that upon which the affliction is, and the priest shall separate the affliction for seven days a second time.
55 And the priest shall see after the affliction is washed; and behold, if the affliction hath not changed its appearance, and the affliction is not spread, it is unclean; in fire shall it be burned; for it is ingrained in the garment, or in the warp, or in the woof.
56 ¶ And if the priest sees, and the affliction is faded after it is washed, he shall tear it off from the garment, or from the skin,
57 Or from the warp, or from the woof. But if it appears again in the garment, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in any vessel made of skin, it is an erupting leprosy; in fire shall it be burned,
58 Wherein the affliction is.

¶ And the garment, or the warp, or the woof, or any vessel of skin, which shall be washed, and the affliction shall depart from it,
59 And it shall be washed a second time, and it shall be clean. This is the law of the affliction of leprosy of a woollen garment, or of a flaxen garment, or of a warp, or of a woof, or of any vessel made of skin, to make it clean, or to make it unclean.
