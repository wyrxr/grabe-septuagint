**ΚΕΦ. ΛΓ´.** ΕΞΟΔΟΣ 157
Ἰεβουσαῖον· καὶ εἰσάξει σε εἰς γῆν ῥέουσαν γάλα καὶ μέλι· οὐ 3
γὰρ συναναβῶ μετὰ σοῦ, διὰ τὸ λαὸν σκληροτράχηλόν σε εἶναι,
ἵνα μὴ ἐξαναλώσω σε ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ. Καὶ ἀκούσας ὁ λαὸς τὸ ῥῆμα 4
τὸ πονηρὸν τοῦτο, κατεπένθησαν ἐν πενθοῖς· οὐκ ἔθηκεν ἀνὴρ
κόσμον αὑτοῦ ἐφ᾽ αὑτόν. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν· λάλη- 5
σον τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ· ὑμεῖς λαὸς σκληροτράχηλος, ὁρᾶτε, μὴ
πληγὴν ἄλλην ἐγὼ ἐπάγω ἐφ᾽ ὑμᾶς, καὶ ἐξαναλώσω ὑμᾶς· νῦν
οὖν ἀφέλετε τὰς στολὰς τῶν δοξῶν ὑμῶν, καὶ τὸν κόσμον, καὶ
δείξω σοι ἃ ποιήσω σοι. Καὶ παριείλαντο οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ τὸν κό- 6
σμον αὑτῶν καὶ τὴν περιστολὴν ἀπὸ τοῦ ὄρους Χωρήβ. Καὶ λα- 7
βὼν Μωυσῆς τὴν σκηνὴν αὑτοῦ, ἔπηξεν ἔξω τῆς παρεμβολῆς,
μακρὰν ἀπὸ τῆς παρεμβολῆς, καὶ ἐκλήθη σκηνὴ μαρτυρίου· καὶ
ἐγένετο, πᾶς ὁ ζητῶν Κύριον ἐξεπορεύετο εἰς τὴν σκηνὴν μαρ-
τυρίου τὴν ἔξω τῆς παρεμβολῆς. Ἡνίκα δ᾽ ἂν εἰσεπορεύετο Μωυ- 8
σῆς εἰς τὴν σκηνήν, εἰστήκει πᾶς ὁ λαός, σκοπεύοντες ἕκαστος
παρὰ τὰς θύρας τῆς σκηνῆς αὑτοῦ· καὶ κατενόουν ἀπιόντος Μωυ-
σῆ, ἕως τοῦ ἐλθεῖν αὑτὸν εἰς τὴν σκηνήν. Ὡς δ᾽ ἂν εἰσῆλθε Μωυ- 9
σῆς εἰς τὴν σκηνήν, κατέβαινεν ὁ στύλος τῆς νεφέλης, καὶ ἵστατο
ἐπὶ τῶν θυρῶν τῆς σκηνῆς, καὶ ἐλάλει τῷ Μωυσῇ. Καὶ ἑώρα 10
πᾶς ὁ λαὸς τὸν στύλον τῆς νεφέλης ἑστῶτα ἐπὶ τῶν θυρῶν τῆς
σκηνῆς· καὶ στάντες πᾶς ὁ λαός, προσεκύνησαν ἕκαστος ἀπὸ τῆς
θύρας τῆς σκηνῆς αὑτοῦ, ( καὶ κατενόουν ἀπιόντος Μωυσῆ). Καὶ 11
ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, ἐνώπιος ἐνωπίῳ, ὡσεί τις λαλή-
σαι πρὸς ἑαυτοῦ φίλον, καὶ ἀπελύετο εἰς τὴν παρεμβολήν· ὁ δὲ
θεράπων Ἰησοῦς υἱὸς Ναυῆ νέος οὐκ ἐξεπορεύετο ἐκ τῆς σκηνῆς.
Καὶ εἶπε Μωυσῆς πρὸς Κύριον· ἰδοὺ σύ μοι λέγεις· ἀνάγαγε τὸν 12
λαὸν τοῦτον, σὺ δὲ οὐκ ἐδήλωσάς μοι, ὃν συναποστελεῖς μετ᾽ ἐμοῦ·
σὺ δέ μοι εἶπας· οἶδά σε παρὰ πάντας, καὶ χάριν ἔχεις παρ᾽ ἐμοί.
Εἰ οὖν εὕρηκα χάριν ἐναντίον σου, ἐμφάνισόν μοι σεαυτὸν γνω- 13
στῶς, ἵνα ἴδω σε, ὅπως ὦ εὑρηκὼς χάριν ἐνώπιόν σου, καὶ ἵνα
γνῶ, ὅτι λαός σου τὸ ἔθνος ( τὸ μέγα ) τοῦτο. Καὶ λέγει· αὐτὸς 14
προπορεύσομαί σου, καὶ καταπαύσω σε. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὑτόν· 15
εἰ μὴ σὺ αὐτὸς συμπορεύσῃ μεθ᾽ ἡμῶν, μή με ἀναγάγῃς ἐντεῦθεν.
Καὶ πῶς γνωστὸν ἔσται ἀληθῶς, ὅτι εὕρηκα χάριν παρὰ σοὶ ἐγώ τε 16
καὶ ὁ λαός σου, ἀλλ᾽ ἢ συμπορευομένου σου μεθ᾽ ἡμῶν; καὶ ἐν-
δοξασθησόμεθα ἐγώ τε καὶ ὁ λαός σου παρὰ πάντα τὰ ἔ-

### Exodus 33

**3** the Jebusite; and He shall bring thee into a land flowing with milk and honey. For I will not ascend with thee, because thou art a stiff-necked people, lest I consume thee in the way.
**4** And when the people heard this evil word, they mourned in sorrow; no man did put his ornament upon himself.
**5** And the Lord said unto Moses, “Speak unto the children of Israel: Ye are a stiff-necked people. Behold, [take heed] lest I bring another plague upon you, and consume you. Now therefore, take off the garments of your glories, and your adornment, and I will show thee what I shall do unto thee.”
**6** And the children of Israel took off their adornment and their apparel from Mount Choreb.
**7** And Moses took his tent and pitched it outside the camp, far from the camp, and it was called the Tent of Witness. And it came to pass, that every one who sought the Lord went forth unto the Tent of Witness which was outside the camp.
**8** And whenever Moses went into the Tent, all the people stood, each man watching at the door of his tent; and they observed Moses as he went, until he came into the Tent.
**9** And when Moses had entered into the Tent, the pillar of the cloud descended, and stood at the door of the Tent, and spake with Moses.
**10** And all the people saw the pillar of the cloud standing at the door of the Tent; and all the people stood up, and worshipped, each man from the door of his own tent, (and they observed Moses as he went).
**11** And the Lord spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend, and he returned unto the camp; but his minister, Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the Tent.
**12** And Moses said unto the Lord, “Behold, Thou sayest unto me, ‘Lead up this people,’ yet Thou hast not shown me whom Thou wilt send with me. And Thou hast said unto me, ‘I know thee above all, and thou hast found favour with Me.’”
**13** “If now I have found favour in Thy sight, manifest Thyself to me clearly, that I may see Thee, so that I may find favour before Thee, and that I may know that this nation is Thy people (the great one).”
**14** And He said, “I myself will go before thee, and I will give thee rest.”
**15** And he said unto Him, “If Thou Thyself go not with us, bring me not up hence.
**16** And how shall it truly be known that I and Thy people have found favour with Thee, except Thou go with us? And so shall I and Thy people be glorified above all the na…”
