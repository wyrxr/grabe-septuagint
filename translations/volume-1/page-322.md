DEUTERONOMY

CHAPTER 1

**1** And these are the words which Moses spake unto all Israel beyond the Jordan, in the wilderness, toward the west, near the Red [Sea], between Paran and between Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Catachrysea.
**2** Eleven days’ journey [it is] from Horeb unto Mount Seir, even unto Kadesh-barnea.
**3** And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first [day] of the month, that Moses spake unto all the children of Israel, according to all that the Lord had commanded him concerning them,
**4** after he had smitten Sihon the king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who dwelt in Astaroth and in Edrei.
**5** Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses began to declare this law, saying:
**6** “The Lord our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount.
**7** Turn ye and depart, and go ye unto the mount of the Amorites, and unto all the neighbors of the Arabah, to the mountain and to the plain, and to the south, and the coastal plain, the land of the Canaanites and Antilibanon, even unto the great river, the river Euphrates.
**8** Behold, I have delivered before you the land; go in and inherit the land, which I sware unto your fathers, unto Abraham, and unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, to give unto them and unto their seed after them.
**9** And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone.
**10** The Lord your God hath multiplied you, and behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.
**11** (The Lord God of your fathers add unto you as ye are a thousandfold, and bless you, as He hath spoken unto you.)
**12** How can I myself alone bear your toil, and your weighty affairs, and your contentions?

ΔΕΥΤΕΡΟΝΟΜΙΟΝ·

ΚΕΦΑΛΑΙΟΝ Α΄. Ι.

ΚΑΙ οὗτοι οἱ λόγοι οὓς ἐλάλησε Μωυσῆς παντὶ ᾿Ισραὴλ
πέραν τοῦ ᾿Ιορδάνου ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ πρὸς δυσμαῖς πλησίον τῆς ἐρυθρᾶς ἀναμέσον Φαρὰν καὶ ἀναμέσον Τοφόλ, καὶ Λοβόν, καὶ Αὐλών, καὶ Καταχρύσεα· ἕνδεκα ἡμερῶν ἐκ Χωρὴβ ὁδὸς ἐπ᾿ ὄρος Σηεὶρ ἕως Κάδης Βαρνή. Καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐν τῷ τεσσαρακοστῷ ἔτει ἐν τῷ ἑνδεκάτῳ μηνὶ μιᾷ τοῦ μηνός, ἐλάλησε Μωυσῆς πρὸς πάντας υἱοὺς ᾿Ισραήλ, κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἐνετείλατο Κύριος αὐτῷ πρὸς αὐτούς, μετὰ τὸ πατάξαι αὐτὸν τὸν Σηὼν βασιλέα τῶν ᾿Αμορραίων τὸν κατοικήσαντα ἐν ᾿Εσεβὼν, καὶ τὸν ᾿Ωγ βασιλέα τῆς Βασὰν τὸν κατοικήσαντα ἐν ᾿Ασταρὼθ καὶ ἐν ᾿Εδραεὶν· ἐν τῷ πέραν τοῦ ᾿Ιορδάνου ἐν γῇ Μωάβ, ἤρξατο Μωυσῆς διασαφῆσαι τὸν νόμον τοῦτον, λέγων· Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν ἐλάλησεν ἡμῖν ἐν Χωρὴβ, λέγων· ἱκανούσθω ὑμῖν κατοικεῖν ἐν τῷ ὄρει τούτῳ· ἐπιστράφητε καὶ ἀπάρατε ὑμεῖς, καὶ εἰσπορεύεσθε εἰς ὄρος ᾿Αμοῤῥαίων, καὶ πρὸς πάντας τοὺς περιοίκους ῎Αραβα, εἰς ὄρος καὶ πεδίον, καὶ πρὸς λίβα, καὶ παραλίαν, γῆν Χαναναίαν καὶ ᾿Αντιλίβανον ἕως τοῦ ποταμοῦ τοῦ μεγάλου, ποταμοῦ Εὐφράτου. Ἴδετε, παραδέδωκα ἐνώπιον ὑμῶν τὴν γῆν· εἰσελθόντες κληρονομήσατε τὴν γῆν, ἣν ὤμοσα τοῖς πατράσιν ὑμῶν τῷ ᾿Αβραάμ, καὶ τῷ ᾿Ισαάκ, καὶ τῷ ᾿Ιακώβ, δοῦναι αὐτοῖς καὶ τῷ σπέρματι αὐτῶν μετ᾿ αὐτούς. Καὶ εἶπα πρὸς ὑμᾶς ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ, λέγων· οὐ δυνήσομαι μόνος φέρειν ὑμᾶς. Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν ἐπλήθυνεν ὑμᾶς, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἔσεσθε σήμερον ὡσεὶ τὰ ἄστρα τοῦ οὐρανοῦ τῷ πλήθει. (Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τῶν πατέρων ὑμῶν προσθείη ὑμῖν ὡς ἐστὲ χιλιοπλασίως, καὶ εὐλογήσαι ὑμᾶς, καθότι ἐλάλησεν ὑμῖν·) πῶς δυνήσομαι φέρειν μόνος τὸν κόπον ὑμῶν καὶ τὴν ὑπόστασιν ὑμῶν καὶ τὰς ἀντιλογίας ὑμῶν; δότε ἑαυτοῖς ἄνδρας σοφοὺς καὶ ἐπιστήμονας καὶ συνετοὺς εἰς τὰς φυλὰς ὑμῶν, καὶ καταστήσω αὐτοὺς ἐφ᾽ ὑμᾶς ἡγουμένους ὑμῶν. Καὶ ἀπεκρίθητέ μοι, καὶ εἴπατε· καλὸν τὸ ῥῆμα ὃ ἐλάλησας ποιῆσαι. Καὶ ἔλαβον τοὺς ἀρχιφύλους ἐξ ὑμῶν ἄνδρας σοφοὺς καὶ ἐπιστήμονας καὶ συνετοὺς, καὶ κατέστησα αὐτοὺς ἡγεῖσθαι ἐφ᾽ ὑμῶν χιλιάρχους, καὶ ἑκατοντάρχους, καὶ πεντηκοντάρχους, καὶ δεκαδάρχους, καὶ γραμματοεισαγωγεῖς τοῖς κριταῖς ὑμῶν. Καὶ ἐνετειλάμην τοῖς κριταῖς ὑμῶν ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ, λέγων· διακούετε ἀναμέσον τῶν ἀδελφῶν ὑμῶν, καὶ κρίνετε δικαίως ἀναμέσον ἀνδρὸς καὶ ἀναμέσον τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀναμέσον προσηλύτου αὐτοῦ. Οὐκ ἐπιγνώσεσθε πρόσωπον ἐν κρίσει, κατὰ τὸν μικρὸν καὶ κατὰ τὸν μέγαν κρινεῖς, οὐ μὴ ὑποστείλῃ πρόσωπον ἀνθρώπου, ὅτι ἡ κρίσις τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐστι· καὶ τὸ ῥῆμα ὃ ἐὰν ᾖ σκληρὸν ἀφ᾽ ὑμῶν, ἀνοίσετε αὐτὸ ἐπ᾽ ἐμὲ, καὶ ἀκούσομαι αὐτό. Καὶ ἐνετειλάμην ὑμῖν ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ τοὺς πάντας λόγους, οὓς ποιήσετε. Καὶ ἀπάραντες ἐκ Χωρήβ, ἐπορεύθημεν πᾶσαν τὴν ἔρημον τὴν μεγάλην καὶ τὴν φοβερὰν ἐκείνην, ἣν εἴδετε ὁδὸν ὄρους τοῦ ᾿Αμορραίου, καθότι ἐνετείλατο Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν ἡμῖν· καὶ ἤλθομεν ἕως Κάδης Βαρνή. Καὶ εἶπα πρὸς ὑμᾶς· ἤλθατε ἕως ὄρους τοῦ ᾿Αμορραίου, ὃ ὁ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν δίδωσιν ἡμῖν. Ἴδετε, παρέδωκε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν πρὸ προσώπου ὑμῶν τὴν γῆν· ἀναβάντες κληρονομεῖτε, ὃν τρόπον εἶπε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τῶν πατέρων ὑμῶν ὑμῖν· μὴ φοβεῖσθε, μηδὲ δειλιάσητε. Καὶ προσήλθατέ μοι πάντες ὑμεῖς, καὶ εἴπατε· ἀποστείλωμεν ἄνδρας προτέρους ἡμῶν, καὶ ἐφοδευσάτωσαν ἡμῖν τὴν γῆν, καὶ ἀναγγειλάτωσαν ἡμῖν ἀπόκρισιν, τὴν ὁδὸν δι᾽ ἧς ἀναβησόμεθα ἐν αὐτῇ, καὶ τὰς πόλεις εἰς ἃς εἰσπορευσόμεθα εἰς αὐτάς. Καὶ ἤρεσεν ἐνώπιόν μου τὸ ῥῆμα, καὶ ἔλαβον ἐξ ὑμῶν δώδεκα ἄνδρας, ἄνδρα ἕνα κατὰ φυλήν. Καὶ ἐπιστραφέντες ἀνέβησαν εἰς τὸ ὄρος, καὶ ἤλθοσαν ἕως φάραγγος βότρυος, καὶ κατεσκόπευσαν αὐτήν· καὶ ἔλαβον ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτῶν ἀπὸ τοῦ καρποῦ τῆς γῆς, καὶ κατήνεγκαν πρὸς ἡμᾶς, καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν ἡμῖν ῥῆμα, καὶ ἔλεγον· ἀγαθὴ ἡ γῆ, ἣν Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν δίδωσιν ἡμῖν. Καὶ οὐκ ἠθελήσατε ἀναβῆναι, ἀλλ᾽ ἠπειθήσατε τῷ ῥήματι Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ὑμῶν· καὶ διεγογγύσατε ἐν ταῖς σκηναῖς ὑμῶν, καὶ εἴπατε· διὰ τὸ μισεῖν Κύριον ἡμᾶς, ἐξήγαγεν ἡμᾶς ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, παραδοῦναι ἡμᾶς εἰς τὰς χεῖρας

**DEUTERONOMY**

**CHAPTER I.**

**1** These are the words which Moses spake unto all Israel beyond the Jordan, in the wilderness, toward the west, near the Red [Sea], between Paran and between Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Catachrysea.
**2** Eleven days’ journey [it is] from Horeb unto Mount Seir, even unto Kadesh-barnea.
**3** And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first [day] of the month, that Moses spake unto all the children of Israel, according to all that the Lord had commanded him concerning them,
**4** after he had smitten Sihon the king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who dwelt in Astaroth and in Edrei.
**5** Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses began to declare this law, saying:
**6** “The Lord our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount.
**7** Turn ye and depart, and go ye unto the mount of the Amorites, and unto all the neighbors of the Arabah, to the mountain and to the plain, and to the south, and the coastal plain, the land of the Canaanites and Antilibanon, even unto the great river, the river Euphrates.
**8** Behold, I have delivered before you the land; go in and inherit the land, which I sware unto your fathers, unto Abraham, and unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, to give unto them and unto their seed after them.
**9** And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone.
**10** The Lord your God hath multiplied you, and behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.
**11** (The Lord God of your fathers add unto you as ye are a thousandfold, and bless you, as He hath spoken unto you.)
**12** How can I myself alone bear your toil, and your weighty affairs, and your contentions?
**13** Give ye yourselves men wise, and men of understanding, and discerning, from among your tribes, and I will set them as rulers over you.
**14** And ye answered me and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do.
**15** So I took the chief men of your tribes, men wise, and men of understanding, and discerning, and made them to be heads over you: captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and secretaries for your judges.
**16** And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear [the causes] between your brethren, and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and between his sojourner.
**17** Ye shall not know favoritism in judgment; thou shalt judge the small and the great alike; thou shalt not be afraid of the face of man, for the judgment is God’s; and the matter which is too hard for you, ye shall bring it unto me, and I will hear it.
**18** And I commanded you at that time all these words, which ye were to perform.
**19** And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mount of the Amorites, as the Lord our God commanded us; and we came unto Kadesh-barnea.
**20** And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mount of the Amorites, which the Lord our God giveth unto us.
**21** Behold, the Lord your God hath delivered the land before you; go up and inherit [it], in the manner the Lord God of your fathers spake unto you; fear not, neither be dismayed.
**22** And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, Let us send men before us, that they may explore for us the land, and bring us a report, [showing] the way by which we must go up into it, and the cities into which we shall enter.
**23** And the thing pleased me well, and I took twelve men of you, one man for each tribe.
**24** And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the Valley of Eshcol, and spied it out.
**25** And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, The land is good, which the Lord our God doth give unto us.
**26** Nevertheless ye would not go up, but rebelled against the word of the Lord your God.
**27** And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the Lord hated us, He hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hands
