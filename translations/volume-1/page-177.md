**35:21** καὶ εἰς πάντα τὰ κάτεργα αὐτῆς, καὶ εἰς πάσας τὰς στολὰς τοῦ
**35:22** ἁγίου. Καὶ ἤνεγκαν οἱ ἄνδρες παρὰ τῶν γυναικῶν αὐτῶν, πᾶς
**35:23** ᾧ ἔδοξε τῇ διανοίᾳ, ἤνεγκαν σφραγῖδας, καὶ ἐνώτια, καὶ δακτυλίους, καὶ ἐμπλόκια, καὶ περιδέξια, πᾶν σκεῦος χρυσοῦν· καὶ πάντες ὅσοι ἤνεγκαν ἀφαίρεμα χρυσίου Κυρίῳ, καὶ πᾶς ᾧ εὑρέθη

**35:23** Yea, all those who brought an offering of gold unto the Lord, and every man with whom was found hyacinth, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and skins of hyacinthine [blue], and rams' skins dyed red, (and sacred skins,) did bring [them].
**35:24** Every man that did offer an offering of silver and bronze, did bring these offerings unto the Lord; and with whom was found incorruptible wood, did bring [it] for all the work of the construction.
