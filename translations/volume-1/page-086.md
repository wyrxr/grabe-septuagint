ΚΕΦ. ΛΘʹ. XXXIX.

ΙΩΣΗΦ δὲ κατήχθη εἰς Αἴγυπτον · καὶ ἐκτήσατο αὐτὸν Πετε- 1
φρῆς, ὁ εὐνοῦχος Φαραω, ὁ ἀρχιμάγειρος, ἀνὴρ Αἰγύπτιος, ἐκ χει-
ρῶν τῶν Ἰσμαηλιτῶν, οἳ κατήγαγον αὐτὸν ἐκεῖ. Καὶ ἦν Κύριος 2
μετὰ Ἰωσήφ, καὶ ἦν ἀνὴρ ἐπιτυγχάνων · καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ
παρὰ τῷ κυρίῳ αὐτοῦ τῷ Αἰγυπτίῳ. Ἤιδει δὲ ὁ κύριος αὐτοῦ, 3
ὅτι Κύριος μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἂν ποιῇ, Κύριος εὐοδοῖ ἐν
ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εὗρεν Ἰωσὴφ χάριν ἐναντίον τοῦ κυρίου 4
αὐτοῦ, εὐηρέστει δὲ αὐτῷ · καὶ κατέστησεν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τοῦ οἴκου αὐ-
τοῦ, καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἦν αὐτῷ, ἔδωκε διὰ χειρὸς Ἰωσήφ. Ἐγένε- 5
το δὲ μετὰ τὸ κατασταθῆναι αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπὶ
πάντα ὅσα ἦν αὐτῷ, καὶ ηὐλόγησε Κύριος τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Αἰγυ-
πτίου διὰ Ἰωσήφ · καὶ ἐγενήθη εὐλογία Κυρίου ἐπὶ πᾶσι τοῖς
ὑπάρχουσιν αὐτῷ, ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ, καὶ ἐν τῷ ἀγρῷ. Καὶ ἐπέστρε- 6
ψε πάντα ὅσα ἦν αὐτῷ εἰς χεῖρας Ἰωσήφ, καὶ οὐκ ᾔδει τῶν καθ᾿
ἑαυτὸν οὐδέν, πλὴν τοῦ ἄρτου οὗ ἤσθιεν αὐτός · καὶ ἦν Ἰωσὴφ κα-
λὸς τῷ εἴδει, καὶ ὡραῖος τῇ ὄψει σφόδρα. Καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ τὰ 7
ῥήματα ταῦτα, καὶ ἐπέβαλεν ἡ γυνὴ τοῦ κυρίου αὐτοῦ τοὺς ὀφ-
θαλμοὺς αὐτῆς ἐπὶ Ἰωσήφ, καὶ εἶπε· κοιμήθητι μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ. Ὁ δὲ 8
οὐκ ἤθελεν, εἶπε δὲ τῇ γυναικὶ τοῦ κυρίου αὐτοῦ· εἰ ὁ κύριός μου
οὐ γινώσκει δι᾿ ἐμὲ οὐδὲν τῶν ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντα ὅσα
ἐστιν αὐτῷ, ἔδωκεν εἰς τὰς χεῖράς μου, καὶ οὐχ ὑπερέχει ἐν τῇ 9
οἰκίᾳ ταύτῃ οὐδὲν ἐμοῦ, οὐδὲ ὑπεξήρηται ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ οὐδὲν πλὴν σοῦ,
διὰ τὸ σὲ γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ εἶναι, καὶ πῶς ποιήσω τὸ ῥῆμα τὸ πο-
νηρὸν τὸ μέγα τοῦτο, καὶ ἁμαρτήσομαι ἐναντίον τοῦ Θεοῦ ; Ἤ- 10
νιζε δὲ ἐλάλει τῷ Ἰωσὴφ ἡμέραν ἐξ ἡμέρας, καὶ οὐχ ὑπήκουεν
αὐτῇ καθεύδειν μετ᾿ αὐτῆς, τοῦ συγγενέσθαι αὐτῇ. Ἐγένετο δὲ 11
τοιούτῃ τινὶ ἡμέρᾳ, καὶ εἰσῆλθεν Ἰωσὴφ εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν, τοῦ ποιεῖν
τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ · καὶ οὐδεὶς ἦν τῶν ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ ἔσω. Καὶ ἐπε- 12
σπάσατο αὐτὸν τῶν ἱματίων αὐτοῦ, λέγουσα· κοιμήθητι μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ.
Καὶ καταλιπὼν τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτῆς, ἔφυγε,
καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ἔξω. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς εἶδεν, ὅτι κατέλιπε τὰ ἱμά- 13

### Genesis 39

<sup>1</sup> Now Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, the chief of his cooks, an Egyptian man, purchased him from the hands of the Ishmaelites, who had brought him down thither.
<sup>2</sup> And the Lord was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master, the Egyptian.
<sup>3</sup> And his master saw that the Lord was with him, and that whatsoever he did, the Lord made it to prosper in his hand.
<sup>4</sup> And Joseph found favor in the sight of his master, and he was well-pleasing unto him; and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had, he committed into Joseph's hand.
<sup>5</sup> And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer over his house, and over all that he had, that the Lord blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the Lord was upon all that he had, both in the house and in the field.
<sup>6</sup> And he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand; and he troubled himself with nothing he had, save for the bread which he himself did eat. And Joseph was handsome in form, and exceedingly fair of countenance.
<sup>7</sup> And it came to pass after these things, that the wife of his master cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.
<sup>8</sup> But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master knoweth not of anything in his house on my account, for all that he hath, he hath delivered into my hands;
<sup>9</sup> and there is none greater than I in this house; neither hath he kept back anything from me but thee, because thou art his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?
<sup>10</sup> And she urged Joseph, speaking to him day by day; but he hearkened not unto her, to lie with her, or to be with her.
<sup>11</sup> And it came to pass upon a certain such day, that Joseph went into the house to do his work; and there was none of the men of the house within.
<sup>12</sup> And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me. And he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and went forth abroad.
<sup>13</sup> And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and had fled, and had gone forth abroad, that she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, Lo,
