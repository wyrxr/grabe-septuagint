ΔΕΥΤΕΡΟΝΟΜΙΟΝ
ΚΕΦ. ΚΕ´. XXV.

1 Ἐὰν δὲ γένηται ἀντιλογία ἀναμέσον ἀνθρώπων, καὶ προσέλθωσιν εἰς κρίσιν, καὶ κρίνωσι, καὶ δικαιώσωσι τὸν δίκαιον, καὶ
2 καταγνῶσι τοῦ ἀσεβοῦς. Καὶ ἔσται ἐὰν ἄξιος ᾖ πληγῶν ὁ ἀσεβῶν, καὶ καθιεῖς αὐτὸν ἔναντι τῶν κριτῶν, καὶ μαστιγώσουσι
3 αὐτὸν ἐναντίον αὐτῶν κατὰ τὴν ἀσέβειαν αὐτοῦ ἀριθμῷ τεσσαράκοντα μαστιγώσουσιν αὐτόν, οὐ προσθήσουσιν· ἐὰν δὲ προσθῶσι
μαστιγῶσαι αὐτὸν ὑπὲρ ταύτας, πληγὰς πλείους, ἀσχημονήσει ὁ
4 ἀδελφός σου ἐναντίον σου. Οὐ φιμώσεις βοῦν ἀλοῶντα.
5 Ἐὰν δὲ κατοικῶσιν ἀδελφοὶ ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό, καὶ ἀποθάνῃ εἷς ἐξ αὐτῶν, σπέρμα δὲ μὴ ᾖ αὐτῷ, οὐκ ἔσται ἡ γυνὴ τοῦ τετελευτηκότος ἔξω ἀνδρὶ μὴ ἐγγίζοντι· ὁ ἀδελφὸς τοῦ ἀνδρὸς αὐτῆς εἰσελεύσεται πρὸς
αὐτήν, καὶ λήψεται αὐτὴν ἑαυτῷ γυναῖκα, καὶ συνοικήσει αὐτῇ.
6 Καὶ ἔσται τὸ παιδίον ὃ ἂν τεχθῇ, κατασταθήσεται ἐκ τοῦ ὀνόματος τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ τοῦ τετελευτηκότος, καὶ οὐκ ἐξαλειφθήσεται τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ ἐξ Ἰσραήλ.
7 Ἐὰν δὲ μὴ βούληται ἄνθρωπος λαβεῖν τὴν γυναῖκα τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀναβήσεται ἡ γυνὴ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν πύλην ἐπὶ τὴν γερουσίαν, καὶ ἐρεῖ· οὐ θέλει ὁ ἀδελφὸς τοῦ ἀνδρός μου ἀναστῆσαι τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ ἐν Ἰσραήλ, οὐκ ἠθέλησεν ὁ ἀδελφὸς τοῦ ἀνδρός
8 μου. Καὶ καλέσουσιν αὐτὸν ἡ γερουσία τῆς πόλεως αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐροῦσιν αὐτῷ, καὶ στὰς εἴπῃ· οὐ βούλομαι λαβεῖν αὐτήν·
9 καὶ προσελθοῦσα ἡ γυνὴ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ πρὸς αὐτὸν ἔναντι τῆς γερουσίας, καὶ ὑπολύσει τὸ ὑπόδημα αὐτοῦ τὸ ἓν ἀπὸ τοῦ ποδὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐμπτύσσεται εἰς τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀποκριθεῖσα ἐρεῖ· οὕτως ποιήτουσι τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ, ὃς οὐκ οἰκοδομήσει τὸν οἶκον τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ·
10 καὶ κληθήσεται τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ ἐν Ἰσραήλ, οἶκος τοῦ ὑπολυθέντος τὸ ὑπόδημα.
11 Ἐὰν δὲ μάχωνται ἄνθρωποι δύο ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό, ἄνθρωπος μετὰ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ προσέλθῃ ἡ γυνὴ ἑνὸς αὐτῶν, ἐξελέσθαι τὸν ἄνδρα αὐτῆς ἐκ χειρὸς τοῦ τύπτοντος αὐτόν,
12 καὶ ἐκτείνασα τὴν χεῖρα αὐτῆς, ἐπιλάβηται τῶν διδύμων αὐτοῦ, ἀποκόψεις τὴν χεῖρα αὐτῆς· οὐ φείσεται ὁ ὀφθαλμός σου ἐπ᾿ αὐτῇ.
13 (Καὶ) οὐκ ἔσται ἐν τῷ μαρσίππῳ σου στάθμιον καὶ στάθμιον,
14 μέγα ἢ μικρόν· οὐκ ἔσται ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ σου μέτρον καὶ μέτρον,

**Deuteronomy 25**

1 If there be a controversy between men, and they draw nigh unto judgment, that they may be judged; and they shall justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked:
2 And it shall come to pass, if the wicked man be found worthy of stripes, that thou shalt set him before the judges, and they shall scourge him before them, according to his wickedness, by number: forty stripes shall they scourge him; they shall not add [thereto].
3 But if they shall add to scourge him above these, [even] more stripes, then shall thy brother be put to shame before thee.
4 Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the grain.

5 If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no seed, the wife of the deceased shall not go abroad unto a man not [of her kin]; her husband's brother shall go in unto her, and take her to him for a wife, and cohabit with her.
6 And it shall be, that the child which she beareth shall be established by the name of his brother who is dead, and his name shall not be blotted out of Israel.
7 But if a man be not willing to take his brother’s wife, then shall his brother’s wife go up to the gate, [even] unto the elders, and she shall say, "My husband’s brother is not willing to raise up the name of his brother in Israel; my husband's brother hath not been willing."
8 And the elders of his city shall call him, and shall speak unto him; and he shall stand [forth] and say, "I am not willing to take her."
9 And his brother’s wife shall come nigh unto him before the elders, and shall loose his sandal, the one from off his foot, and she shall spit in his face; and she shall answer and say, "Thus shall they do unto the man that will not build up his brother’s house."
10 And his name shall be called in Israel, "The house of him whose sandal was loosed."

11 If two men strive together upon the same [ground], a man with his brother, and the wife of one of them draw nigh to deliver her husband from the hand of him that smiteth him,
12 and she stretcheth forth her hand, and layeth hold upon his testicles, thou shalt cut off her hand; thine eye shall not pity her.

13 [(And)] There shall not be in thy purse a weight and a weight,
14 a great or a small [one]; there shall not be in thy house a measure and a measure,
