καὶ ἡ ῥάβδος τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐν τῇ χειρί μου. Καὶ ἐποίησεν Ἰησοῦς 10
καθάπερ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Μωυσῆς, καὶ παρετάξατο τῷ Ἀμαλὴκ καὶ
Μωυσῆς καὶ Ἀαρὼν καὶ Ὠρ ἀνέβησαν ἐπὶ τὴν κορυφὴν τοῦ βουνοῦ.
Καὶ ἐγένετο, ὅταν ἐπῆρε Μωυσῆς τὰς χεῖρας αὑτοῦ, κατίσχυεν Ἰσραήλ: 11
ὅταν δὲ καθῆκε τὰς χεῖρας αὑτοῦ, κατίσχυεν Ἀμαλήκ. Αἱ δὲ 12
χεῖρες Μωυσῆ βαρεῖαι· καὶ λαβόντες λίθον, ὑπέθηκαν ὑπ᾿ αὐτὸν, καὶ
ἐκάθητο ἐπ᾿ αὐτόν· Ἀαρὼν δὲ καὶ Ὠρ ἐστήριζον τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ,
ἐντεῦθεν εἷς, καὶ ἐντεῦθεν εἷς· καὶ ἐγένοντο αἱ χεῖρες Μωυσῆ
ἐστηριγμέναι ἕως δυσμῶν ἡλίου. Καὶ ἐτρέψατο Ἰησοῦς τὸν Ἀμαλὴκ, 13
καὶ πάντα τὸν λαὸν αὑτοῦ ἐν φόνῳ μαχαίρας. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος 14
πρὸς Μωυσῆν· κατάγραφον τοῦτο εἰς μνημόσυνον ἐν βιβλίῳ, καὶ
δὸς εἰς τὰ ὦτα Ἰησοῦ, ὅτι ἀλοιφῇ ἐξαλείψω τὸ μνημόσυνον Ἀμαλὴκ
ἐκ τῆς ὑπὸ τὸν οὐρανόν. Καὶ ᾠκοδόμησε Μωυσῆς θυσιαστήριον, καὶ 15
ἐπωνόμασε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ, Κύριός μου καταφυγή· ὅτι ἐν χειρὶ 16
κρυφαίᾳ πολεμήσει Κύριος ἐπὶ Ἀμαλὴκ ἀπὸ γενεῶν εἰς γενεάς.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΗ'. XVIII.

ἬΚΟΥΣΕ δὲ Ἰοθὸρ ὁ γαμβρὸς Μωυσῆ ὁ ἱερεὺς Μαδιὰμ πάντα 1
ὅσα ἐποίησε Κύριος τῷ Ἰσραὴλ τῷ ἑαυτοῦ λαῷ· ἐξήγαγε γὰρ Κύριος
τὸν Ἰσραὴλ ἐξ Αἰγύπτου. Ἔλαβε δὲ Ἰοθὸρ ὁ γαμβρὸς Μωυσῆ 2
Σεπφώραν τὴν γυναῖκα Μωυσῆ, μετὰ τὴν ἄφεσιν αὐτῆς, καὶ τοὺς 3
δύο υἱοὺς αὐτῆς· ὄνομα τῷ ἑνὶ Γηρσὰμ, λέγων πάροικος ἤμην ἐν γῇ
ἀλλοτρίᾳ. Καὶ τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ δευτέρου Ἐλιέζερ· ὁ γὰρ Θεὸς τοῦ 4
πατρός μου βοηθός μου, καὶ ἐξειλάτο με ἐκ μαχαίρας Φαραώ.
Καὶ ἦλθεν Ἰοθὸρ ὁ γαμβρὸς Μωυσῆ καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἡ γυνὴ 5
πρὸς Μωυσῆν εἰς τὴν ἔρημον, οὗ παρενέβαλεν εἰς τὸ ὄρος τοῦ Θεοῦ.
Ἀπηγγέλη δὲ Μωυσῆ, λέγοντες· Ἰδοὺ Ἰοθὸρ ὁ γαμβρός σου 6
παραγίνεται πρός σε, καὶ ἡ γυνή σου, καὶ οἱ δύο υἱοί σου μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ.
Ἐξῆλθε δὲ Μωυσῆς εἰς συνάντησιν τῷ γαμβρῷ αὑτοῦ, καὶ 7
προσεκύνησεν αὐτῷ, καὶ ἐφίλησεν αὐτὸν, καὶ ἠσπάσαντο ἀλλήλους,
καὶ εἰσήγαγεν αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν σκηνήν. Καὶ διηγήσατο Μωυσῆς τῷ 8
γαμβρῷ αὑτοῦ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησε Κύριος τῷ Φαραὼ καὶ τοῖς
Αἰγυπτίοις ἕνεκεν τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ πάντα τὸν μόχθον τὸν γενόμενον
αὐτοῖς ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ, καὶ ὅτι ἐξειλάτο αὐτοὺς Κύριος ἐκ χειρός. 9

**CHAPTER XVII**

10 and the rod of God in my hand. And Joshua did as Moses told him, and he arrayed himself against Amalek; and Moses and Aaron and Hur went up unto the top of the hill.
11 And it came to pass, when Moses lifted up his hands, that Israel prevailed: but when he let down his hands, Amalek prevailed.
12 But the hands of Moses were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat upon it; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, one from this side, and one from that side; and the hands of Moses were made steady until the setting of the sun.
13 And Joshua discomfited Amalek, and all his people with the edge of the sword.
14 And the Lord said unto Moses, "Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for with utter destruction will I blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven."
15 And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it,
16 "My Lord [is] a refuge;" for with a hidden hand the Lord will wage war against Amalek from generation to generation.

**CHAPTER XVIII**

1 Now Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses, the priest of Midian, heard of all things which the Lord had done for Israel, His own people; for the Lord had brought forth Israel out of Egypt.
2 And Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses, took Zipporah, Moses’ wife, after her sending away,
3 and her two sons of hers; the name of the one was Gershom, for he said, "I have been a sojourner in a foreign land."
4 And the name of the second was Eliezer; for the God of my father [is] my helper, and He delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.
5 And Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses, and his sons and his wife came unto Moses into the wilderness, where he was encamped at the mount of God.
6 And it was told unto Moses, saying, "Behold, Jethro thy father-in-law cometh unto thee, and thy wife, and thy two sons with him."
7 And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and bowed himself to him, and kissed him; and they saluted one another.
8 And he brought them into the tent. And Moses recounted unto his father-in-law all that the Lord had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the toil that had befallen them on the way,
9 and that the Lord had delivered them out of [the] hand.
