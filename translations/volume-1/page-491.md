17 ζει, καὶ οὐκ ἐπιτιμήσετε αὐτῇ. Καὶ συνέλεξεν ἐν τῷ ἀγρῷ ἕως
   ἑσπέρας· καὶ ἐρράδισεν ἃ συνέλεξε, καὶ ἐγενήθη ὡς ὀψὲ κριθῶν.
18 Καὶ ἦρσε, καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὴν πόλιν· καὶ εἶδεν ἡ πενθερὰ αὐ-
   τῆς ἃ συνέλεξε, καὶ ἐξενέγκασα Ῥούθ, ἔδωκεν αὐτῇ ἃ κατέλι-
19 πεν, ἐξ ὧν ἐνεπλήσθη. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ ἡ πενθερὰ αὐτῆς· ποῦ
   συνέλεξας σήμερον, καὶ ποῦ ἐποίησας; εἴη δ᾽ ἐπιγνούς σε εὐλο-
   γημένος. Καὶ ἀπήγγειλε Ῥούθ τῇ πενθερᾷ αὐτῆς ποῦ ἐποίησε,
   καὶ εἶπε· τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ ἀνδρὸς μεθ᾽ οὗ ἐποίησα σήμερον, Βοόζ.
20 Καὶ εἶπε Νεεμμεὶν τῇ νύμφῃ αὐτῆς· εὐλογητὸς ἔστι τῷ Κυρίῳ
   ὅτι οὐκ ἐγκατέλιπε τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ μετὰ τῶν ζώντων καὶ μετὰ
   τῶν τεθνηκότων. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ Νεεμμεὶν· ἐγγίζει ἡμῖν ὁ ἀνήρ,
   ἐκ τῶν ἀγχιστευόντων ἡμᾶς ἐστι.
21 Καὶ εἶπε Ῥούθ πρὸς τὴν πενθερὰν αὐτῆς· καὶ γε ἔτι εἶπε πρὸς με·
   μετὰ τῶν παιδαρίων τῶν ἐμῶν προσκολλήθητι, ἕως ἂν τελέσωσιν
   ὅλον τὸν ἀμητὸν, ὃς ὑπάρχει μοι.
22 Καὶ εἶπε Νεεμμεὶν πρὸς Ῥούθ τὴν νύμφην αὐ-
   τῆς· ἀγαθὸν θύγατερ, ὅτι ἐπορεύθης μετὰ τῶν κορασίων αὐτοῦ,
23 καὶ οὐκ ἀπαντήσονται σοι ἐν ἀγρῷ ἑτέρῳ. Καὶ προσεκολλήθη
   Ῥούθ τοῖς κορασίοις Βοὸζ τοῦ συλλέγειν, ἕως οὗ συνετέλεσε τὸν
   θερισμὸν τῶν κριθῶν καὶ τὸν θερισμὸν τῶν πυρῶν· καὶ ἐκάθισε
   μετὰ τῆς πενθερᾶς αὐτῆς.

**ΚΕΦ. Γ΄. ΙΙΙ.**

1 Εἶπε δὲ Νεεμμεὶν τῇ νύμφῃ αὐτῆς· θύγατερ, οὐ μὴ εὕρω
2 σοι ἀνάπαυσιν, ἵνα εὖ γένηταί σοι ; Καὶ νῦν οὐχὶ Βοὸζ γνώριμος
   ἡμῶν, οὗ ἧς μετὰ τῶν κορασίων αὐτοῦ; ἰδοὺ αὐτὸς λικμᾷ τὸν
3 ἅλωνα τῶν κριθῶν ταύτῃ τῇ νυκτί. Σὺ δὲ λοῦσῃ, καὶ ἀλείψῃ,
   καὶ περιθήσῃ τὸν ἱματισμόν σου ἐπὶ σεαυτῇ, καὶ ἀναβήσῃ ἐπὶ τὸν
   ἅλω· μὴ γνωρισθῇς τῷ ἀνδρὶ, ἕως οὗ συντελέσαι αὐτὸν φαγεῖν
4 καὶ πιεῖν. Καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῷ κοιμηθῆναι αὐτὸν, καὶ γνώσῃ τὸν
   τόπον οὗ κοιμᾶται ἐκεῖ, καὶ ἐλεύσῃ, καὶ ἀποκαλύψεις τὰ πρὸς
   ποδῶν αὐτοῦ, καὶ κοιμηθήσῃ· καὶ αὐτὸς ἀπαγγελει σοι ἃ ποιή-
5 σεις. Εἶπε δὲ Ῥούθ πρὸς αὐτήν· πάντα ὅσα ἐὰν εἴπῃς ἐμοὶ,
6 ποιήσω. Καὶ κατέβη εἰς τὸν ἅλω, καὶ ἐποίησε κατὰ πάντα
7 ὅσα ἐνετείλατο αὐτῇ ἡ πενθερὰ αὐτῆς. Καὶ ἔφαγε Βοὸς, καὶ ἔπιε,
   καὶ ἠγαλλιάθη ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἦλθε κοι-

### Chapter 2

**17.** And you shall not put her to shame." So she gleaned in the field until evening; and she beat out what she had gathered, and it became as the evening's measure of barley.
**18.** And she took [it] up, and went into the city; and her mother-in-law saw what she had gathered; and Ruth brought forth, and gave to her that which she had reserved after she was sufficed.
**19.** Then her mother-in-law said unto her, "Where have you gleaned today, and where have you wrought? Blessed be he that did take notice of you." And Ruth recounted unto her mother-in-law where she had wrought, and said, "The name of the man with whom I wrought today is Boaz."
**20.** And Naomi said unto her daughter-in-law, "Blessed be he of the Lord, for he has not forsaken his mercy with the living and with the dead." And Naomi said unto her, "The man is near unto us; he is one of our near kinsmen."
**21.** And Ruth said unto her mother-in-law, "Moreover, he said unto me: 'Cleave to my young men until they shall have finished all the harvest which is mine.'"
**22.** And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter-in-law, "It is good, my daughter, that you did go with his maidens,
**23.** and that they shall not molest you in another field." So Ruth kept close unto the maidens of Boaz to glean, until she had finished the barley harvest and the wheat harvest; and she abode with her mother-in-law.

### Chapter 3

**1.** Then Naomi her mother-in-law said unto her, "My daughter, shall I not seek rest for you, that it may be well with you?
**2.** And now, is not Boaz our kinsman, with whose maidens you were? Behold, he himself winnows the barley at the threshing floor this night.
**3.** Therefore, wash yourself, and anoint yourself, and put your raiment upon you, and go down to the threshing floor; but make not yourself known unto the man until he shall have finished eating and drinking.
**4.** And it shall be, when he lies down, that you shall mark the place where he lies there, and you shall come, and uncover [the place at] his feet, and lie down; and he himself shall tell you what you shall do."
**5.** And Ruth said unto her, "All that whatsoever you say unto me, I will do."
**6.** So she went down unto the threshing floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law had commanded her.
**7.** And Boaz ate, and drank, and his heart was merry; and he came to lie down
