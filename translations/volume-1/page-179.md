αὐτοῦ, διπλοῦν. Καὶ συνυφάνθη ἐν αὐτῷ ὕφασμα καταλέλιθον τετράστιχον, στίχος λίθων· σάρδιον καὶ τοπάζιον καὶ σμάραγδος, ὁ στίχος ὁ εἷς· καὶ ὁ στίχος ὁ δεύτερος, ἄνθραξ καὶ σάπφειρος καὶ ἴασπις· καὶ ὁ στίχος ὁ τρίτος, λιγύριον καὶ ἀχάτης καὶ ἀμέθυστος· καὶ ὁ στίχος ὁ τέταρτος, χρυσόλιθος καὶ βηρύλλιον καὶ ὀνύχιον, περικεχυκλωμένα χρυσίῳ, καὶ συνδεδεμένα ἐν χρυσίῳ· καὶ οἱ λίθοι ἦσαν ἐκ τῶν ὀνομάτων τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ δώδεκα, κατὰ τὰ ὀνόματα αὐτῶν ἐγγεγλυμμένα σφραγῖδας, ἕκαστος ἐκ τοῦ ἑαυτοῦ ὀνόματος εἰς τὰς δώδεκα φυλάς. Καὶ ἐποίησαν ἐπὶ τὸ λογεῖον κροσσοὺς συμπεπλεγμένους, ἔργον ἐμπλοχίου, ἐκ χρυσίου καθαροῦ· καὶ ἐποίησαν δύο ἀσπιδίσκας χρυσᾶς, καὶ δύο δακτυλίους χρυσοῦς, καὶ ἐπέθηκαν τοὺς δύο δακτυλίους τοὺς χρυσοῦς ἐπ᾿ ἀμφοτέρας τὰς ἀρχὰς τοῦ λογείου· καὶ ἐπέθηκαν τὰ ἐμπλόκια ἐκ χρυσίου ἐπὶ τοὺς δύο δακτυλίους ἐπ᾿ ἀμφοτέρων τῶν μερῶν τοῦ λογείου, καὶ εἰς τὰς δύο συμβολὰς τὰ δύο ἐμπλόκια, καὶ ἐπέθηκαν ἐπὶ τὰς δύο ἀσπιδίσκας· καὶ ἐπέθηκαν ἐπὶ τοὺς ὤμους τῆς ἐπωμίδος ἐξεναντίας κατὰ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐποίησαν δύο δακτυλίους χρυσοῦς, καὶ ἐπέθηκαν ἐπὶ τὰ δύο πτερύγια ἐπ᾿ ἄκρου τοῦ λογείου, ἐπὶ τὸ ἄκρον τοῦ ὀπισθίου τῆς ἐπωμίδος ἔσωθεν· καὶ ἐποίησαν δύο δακτυλίους χρυσοῦς, καὶ ἐπέθηκαν ἐπ᾿ ἀμφοτέρους τοὺς ὤμους τῆς ἐπωμίδος κάτωθεν αὐτοῦ κατὰ πρόσωπον κατὰ τὴν συμβολὴν, ἄνωθεν τῆς συνυφῆς τῆς ἐπωμίδος· καὶ συνέσφιγξε τὸ λογεῖον ἀπὸ τῶν δακτυλίων τῶν ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῦ εἰς τοὺς δακτυλίους τῆς ἐπωμίδος, συνεχομένους ἐκ τῆς ὑακίνθου, συμπεπλεγμένους εἰς τὸ ὕφασμα τῆς ἐπωμίδος, ἵνα μὴ χαλάτῃ τὸ λογεῖον ἀπὸ τῆς ἐπωμίδος, καθὰ συνέταξε Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ. Καὶ ἐποίησαν τὸν ὑποδύτην ὑπὸ τὴν ἐπωμίδα, ἔργον ὑφαντόν, ὅλον ὑακίνθινον· τὸ δὲ περιστόμιον τοῦ ὑποδύτου ἐν τῷ μέσω διωραμμένον συμπλεκτόν, ᾠάν ἔχον κύκλῳ τὸ περιστόμιον ἀδιάλυτον. Καὶ ἐποίησαν ἐπὶ τοῦ λώματος τοῦ ὑποδύτου κάτωθεν ὡς ἐξανθούσης ῥοὰς ῥοΐσκους ἐξ ὑακίνθου, καὶ πορφύρας, καὶ κοκκίνου νενησμένου, καὶ βύσσου κεκλωσμένης. Καὶ ἐποίησαν κώδωνας χρυσοῦς, καὶ ἐπέθηκαν τοὺς κώδωνας ἐπὶ τὸ λῶμα τοῦ ὑποδύτου κύκλῳ ἀνὰ μέσον τῶν ῥοΐσκων· κώδων χρυσοῦς καὶ ῥοΐσκος ἐπὶ τὸ λῶμα τοῦ ὑποδύτου κύκλῳ, εἰς τὸ λειτουργεῖν, καθὰ συνέταξε Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ. Καὶ ἐποίησαν χιτῶνας βυσσίνους, ἔργον ὑφαντὸν Ἀαρὼν

EXODUS CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX

...thereof, [being] doubled. And woven within it was a fabric set with stones, a fourfold row, a row of stones; the first row, a sardius, and a topaz, and an emerald; and the second row, a carbuncle, and a sapphire, and a jasper; and the third row, a ligure, and an agate, and an amethyst; and the fourth row, a chrysolite, and a beryl, and an onyx. These were encircled with gold, and fastened in gold. And the stones were according to the names of the twelve sons of Israel, engraven with the engravings of a signet according to their names, every one with his name, according to the twelve tribes.

And they made upon the breastplate chains interwoven, work of a plait, of pure gold. And they made two golden ouches, and two rings of gold, and they placed the two golden rings upon both ends of the breastplate. And they placed the plaits of gold upon the two rings on both sides of the breastplate, and into the two joinings [they placed] the two plaits, and they placed them upon the two ouches. And they placed [the breastplate] upon the shoulders of the ephod, in front, before its face.

And they made two rings of gold, and placed them upon the two wings at the uppermost edge of the breastplate, upon the uttermost edge of the ephod on the inside thereof. And two rings of gold made they, and placed them upon both shoulders of the ephod underneath it, toward the forefront, at the joining, above the woven work of the ephod. And thus was the breastplate fastened by the rings that were upon it unto the rings of the ephod, being held fast by the hyacinth [cord], interwoven into the fabric of the ephod, that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod, as the Lord did command Moses.

And they made the robe [to be worn] under the ephod, a woven work, all of hyacinth blue. And the neck-opening of the robe, slit in the midst and braided, having a hem round about the neck-opening, which was not rent. And they made upon the hem of the robe beneath, as it were of blossoming streams, pomegranates of hyacinth blue, and purple, and spun scarlet, and twisted fine linen. And they made bells of gold, and placed the bells upon the hem of the robe round about, between the pomegranates; a bell of gold and a pomegranate upon the hem of the robe round about, for the ministering, as the Lord did command Moses.

And they made tunics of fine linen, woven work, for Aaron.
