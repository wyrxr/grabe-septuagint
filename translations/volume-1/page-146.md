ΚΕΦ. Κ´. ΕΞΟΔΟΣ 131
ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ ἄνω, καὶ ὅσα ἐν τῇ γῇ κάτω, καὶ ὅσα ἐν τοῖς ὕδασιν ὑποκάτω τῆς γῆς· οὐ προσκυνήσεις αὐτοῖς, οὐδὲ μὴ λατρεύσεις αὐτοῖς· ἐγὼ γάρ εἰμι Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου, Θεὸς ζηλωτής,
ἀποδιδοὺς ἁμαρτίας πατέρων ἐπὶ τέκνα, ἐπὶ τρίτην καὶ τετάρτην
γενεὰν τοῖς μισοῦσί με, καὶ ποιῶν ἔλεος εἰς χιλιάδας τοῖς ἀγαπῶσί με, καὶ τοῖς φυλάσσουσι τὰ προστάγματά μου. Οὐ λήψῃ τὸ
ὄνομα Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ σου ἐπὶ ματαίῳ· οὐ γὰρ μὴ καθαρίσῃ
Κύριος τὸν λαμβάνοντα τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ ματαίῳ. Μνήσθητι
τὴν ἡμέραν τῶν σαββάτων, τοῦ ἁγιάζειν αὐτήν· ἓξ ἡμέρας ἐργᾷ,
καὶ ποιήσεις πάντα τὰ ἔργα σου· τῇ δὲ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ σάββατα Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ σου· οὐ ποιήσεις ἐν αὐτῇ πᾶν ἔργον σὺ
καὶ ὁ υἱός σου καὶ ἡ θυγάτηρ σου, ὁ παῖς σου καὶ ἡ παιδίσκη
σου, ὁ βοῦς σου καὶ τὸ ὑποζύγιόν σου καὶ πᾶν κτῆνός σου, καὶ
ὁ προσήλυτός σου ὁ παροικῶν ἐν σοί. Ἐν γὰρ ἓξ ἡμέραις ἐποίησε Κύριος τόν τε οὐρανὸν καὶ τὴν γῆν καὶ τὴν θάλασσαν, καὶ
πάντα τὰ ἐν αὐτοῖς, καὶ κατέπαυσεν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ· διὰ
τοῦτο ηὐλόγησε Κύριος τὴν ἡμέραν τὴν ἑβδόμην, καὶ ἡγίασεν αὐτήν. Τίμα τὸν πατέρα σου καὶ τὴν μητέρα σου, ἵνα εὖ σοι γένηται, καὶ ἵνα μακροχρόνιος γένῃ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς τῆς ἀγαθῆς, ἧς
Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου δίδωσί σοι.
Οὐ φονεύσεις.
Οὐ μοιχεύσεις.
Οὐ κλέψεις.
Οὐ ψευδομαρτυρήσεις κατὰ τοῦ πλησίον σου μαρτυρίαν ψευδῆ.
Οὐκ ἐπιθυμήσεις τὴν γυναῖκα τοῦ πλησίον σου· οὐκ ἐπιθυμήσεις
τὴν οἰκίαν τοῦ πλησίον σου, οὐδὲ τὸν ἀγρὸν αὐτοῦ, οὐδὲ τὸν παῖδα αὐτοῦ, οὐδὲ τὴν παιδίσκην αὐτοῦ, οὔτε τοῦ βοὸς αὐτοῦ, οὔτε
τοῦ ὑποζυγίου αὐτοῦ, οὔτε παντὸς κτήνους αὐτοῦ, οὔτε ὅσα τῷ
πλησίον σου ἐστί. Καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ἑώρα τὴν φωνήν, καὶ τὰς λαμπάδας, καὶ τὴν φωνὴν τῆς σάλπιγγος, καὶ τὸ ὄρος τὸ καπνῖζον·
φοβηθέντες δὲ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ἔστησαν μακρόθεν. Καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς
Μωυσῆν· λάλησον σὺ ἡμῖν, καὶ μὴ λαλείτω πρὸς ἡμᾶς ὁ Θεός,
μήποτε ἀποθάνωμεν. Καὶ λέγει αὐτοῖς Μωυσῆς· θαρσεῖτε· ἕνεκεν
γὰρ τοῦ πειράσαι ὑμᾶς, παρεγενήθη ὁ Θεὸς πρὸς ὑμᾶς, ὅπως ἂν
γένηται ὁ φόβος αὐτοῦ ἐν ὑμῖν, ἵνα μὴ ἁμαρτάνητε. Εἱστήκει δὲ
ὁ λαὸς μακρόθεν· Μωυσῆς δὲ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸν γνόφον, οὗ ἦν ἐκεῖ
ὁ Θεός.

**EXODUS. CHAPTER XX.**

**4** [that are] in the heaven above, and whatsoever [is] in the earth beneath, and whatsoever [is] in the waters under the earth. Thou shalt not worship them, neither shalt thou serve them;
**5** for I am the Lord thy God, a jealous God, visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate Me,
**6** and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love Me and keep My commandments.
**7** Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh His name in vain.
**8** Remember the Sabbath day, to hallow it.
**9** Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work;
**10** but the seventh day is a Sabbath unto the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy sojourner that abideth with thee.
**11** For in six days the Lord made the heaven and the earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested on the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it.
**12** Honor thy father and thy mother, that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest live long upon the good land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.

**13** Thou shalt not murder.
**14** Thou shalt not commit adultery.
**15** Thou shalt not steal.
**16** Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.
**17** Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife; thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s house, neither his field, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any of his cattle, nor whatsoever [else] that is thy neighbor’s.

**18** And all the people saw the voice, and the torch-lights, and the voice of the trumpet, and the smoking mountain; and being afraid, all the people stood afar off.
**19** And they said unto Moses, “Speak thou with us, and let not God speak with us, lest we die.”
**20** And Moses said unto them, “Fear ye not; for God is come unto you to prove you, and that His fear may be in you, that ye may not sin.”
**21** And the people stood afar off; and Moses entered into the thick darkness, where God was.
