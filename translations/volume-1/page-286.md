ΚΕΦ. ΙΘ'.
9 ἑσπέρας. Καὶ συνάξει ἄνθρωπος καθαρὸς τὴν σποδὸν τῆς δαμάλεως, καὶ ἀποθήσει ἔξω τῆς παρεμβολῆς εἰς τόπον καθαρόν, καὶ ἔσται τῇ συναγωγῇ υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ εἰς διατήρησιν· ὕδωρ ῥαντισμοῦ ἁγνισμά ἐστι.
10 Καὶ ὁ συνάγων τὴν σποδὸν τῆς δαμάλεως πλυνεῖ τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀκάθαρτος ἔσται ἕως ἑσπέρας· καὶ ἔσται τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ τοῖς προσηλύτοις τοῖς προσκειμένοις ἐν μέσῳ ὑμῶν, νόμιμον αἰώνιον.
11 Ὁ ἀπτόμενος τοῦ τεθνηκότος πάσης ψυχῆς ἀνθρώπου, ἀκάθαρτος ἔσται ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας (ἕως ἑσπέρας)·
12 οὗτος ἀγνοσθήσεται ἐν αὐτῷ καὶ τῇ ἡμέρα τῇ τρίτῃ καὶ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ, καὶ καθαρὸς ἔσται· ἐὰν δὲ μὴ ἀφαγνισθῇ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τρίτῃ καὶ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ, οὐ καθαρὸς ἔσται.
13 Πᾶς ὁ ἀπτόμενος τοῦ τεθνηκότος ἀπὸ πάσης ψυχῆς ἀνθρώπου, ἐὰν ἀποθάνῃ, καὶ μὴ ἀφαγνισθῇ, τὴν σκηνὴν Κυρίου ἐμίανεν· ἐκτριβήσεται ἡ ψυχὴ ἐκείνη ἐξ Ἰσραήλ, ὅτι ὕδωρ ῥαντισμοῦ οὐ περιεῤῥαντίσθη ἐπ’ αὐτόν· ἀκάθαρτος ἐστι, ἔτι ἡ ἀκαθαρσία αὐτοῦ ἐν αὐτῷ ἐστι.
14 Καὶ οὗτος ὁ νόμος· ἄνθρωπος ἐὰν ἀποθάνῃ ἐν οἰκίᾳ, πᾶς ὁ εἰσπορευόμενος εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν, καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐστὶν ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ, ἀκάθαρτα ἔσται ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας·
15 καὶ πᾶν σκεῦος ἀνεῳγμένον, ὅσα οὐχὶ δεσμὸν καταδέδεται ἐπ’ αὐτῷ, ἀκάθαρτά ἐστι.
16 Καὶ πᾶς ὃς ἂν ἅψηται ἐπὶ πρόσωπον τοῦ πεδίου τραυματίου ῥομφαία, ἢ νεκροῦ, ἢ ὀστέου ἀνθρώπου, ἢ μνήματος, ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας ἀκάθαρτος ἔσται.
17 Καὶ λήψονται τῷ ἀκαθάρτῳ ἀπὸ τῆς σποδιᾶς τῆς κατακεκαυμένης τοῦ ἁγνισμοῦ, καὶ ἐγχεοῦσιν ἐπ’ αὐτὴν ὕδωρ ζῶν εἰς σκεῦος.
18 Καὶ λήψεται ὕσσωπον, καὶ βάψει εἰς τὸ ὕδωρ ἀνὴρ καθαρός, καὶ περιῤῥανεῖ ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον, καὶ ἐπὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς ψυχάς, ὅσαι ἐὰν ὦσιν ἐκεῖ, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν ἡμμένον τοῦ ὀστέου τοῦ ἀνθρωπίνου, ἢ τοῦ τραυματίου, ἢ τοῦ τεθνηκότος, ἢ τοῦ μνήματος·
19 καὶ περιῤῥανεῖ ὁ καθαρὸς ἐπὶ τὸν ἀκάθαρτον ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τρίτῃ, (ἔπειτα) καὶ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ, καὶ ἀφαγνισθήσεται ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ· καὶ πλυνεῖ τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ, καὶ λούσεται ὕδατι, καὶ ἀκάθαρτος ἔσται ἕως ἑσπέρας.
20 Καὶ ἄνθρωπος ὃς ἂν μιανθῇ, καὶ μὴ ἀφαγνισθῇ, ἐξολοθρευθήσεται ἡ ψυχὴ ἐκ μέσου τῆς συναγωγῆς, ὅτι τὰ ἅγια Κυρίου ἐμίανεν· ὅτι ὕδωρ ῥαντισμοῦ οὐ περιεῤῥαντίσθη ἐπ’ αὐτόν, ἀκάθαρτός ἐστι.
21 Καὶ ἔσται ὑμῖν νόμιμον αἰώνιον· καὶ ὁ περιῤῥαίνων ὕδωρ ῥαντισμοῦ, πλυνεῖ τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὁ ἀπτόμενος τοῦ ὕδατος τοῦ ῥαντισμοῦ, ἀκάθαρτος ἔσται:

### NUMBERS. CHAPTER XIX.

9 unto the evening. And a clean man shall gather the ashes of the heifer, and shall lay [them] up outside the camp in a clean place; and it shall be for the congregation of the sons of Israel for a preservation: it is water of sprinkling for purification.
10 And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his garments, and shall be unclean until the evening. And this shall be for the sons of Israel, and for the proselytes that sojourn among you, an everlasting statute.

11 Whosoever toucheth the dead [body] of any soul of man shall be unclean seven days (until the evening).
12 This [one] shall be purified by it on the third day and on the seventh day, and he shall be clean. But if he be not purified on the third day and on the seventh day, he shall not be clean.
13 Whosoever toucheth the dead [body] from every soul of man, if it die, and is not purified, he hath defiled the tabernacle of the Lord. That soul shall be utterly destroyed from Israel, because the water of sprinkling was not sprinkled upon him; he is unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him.

14 And this is the law: If a man die in a house, every one that cometh into the house, and all that is in the house, shall be unclean seven days.
15 And every open vessel, which hath no binding covering upon it, is unclean.
16 And whosoever toucheth, upon the face of the field, one slain by a sword, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, he shall be unclean seven days.

17 And they shall take for the unclean person some of the ashes of the burnt [heifer] for purification, and shall pour upon it living water into a vessel.
18 And a clean man shall take hyssop, and dip [it] into the water, and shall sprinkle upon the house, and upon all the vessels, and upon the souls [persons], as many as shall be there, and upon him that hath touched the bone of a man, or the wounded person, or the dead [body], or the grave.
19 And the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean person on the third day, (then) and on the seventh day; and he shall be purified on the seventh day. And he shall wash his garments, and bathe himself in water, and shall be unclean until the evening.
20 And the man who shall be defiled, and shall not be purified, that soul shall be utterly destroyed from the midst of the congregation, because he hath defiled the holy things of the Lord; because the water of sprinkling was not sprinkled upon him, he is unclean.
21 And it shall be a perpetual statute unto you: and he that sprinkleth the water of sprinkling shall wash his garments; and he that toucheth the water of sprinkling shall be unclean:
