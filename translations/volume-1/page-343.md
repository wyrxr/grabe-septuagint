σου, οὓς ἐξήγαγες ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου ἐν τῇ ἰσχύϊ σου τῇ μεγάλῃ,

ΚΕΦ. Ιʹ. Χ.

1 Ἐν ἐκείνῳ τῷ καιρῷ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς μέ· λάξευσον σεαυ-
τῷ δύο πλάκας λιθίνας ὥσπερ τὰς πρώτας, καὶ ἀνάβηθι πρὸς μέ
εἰς τὸ ὄρος, καὶ ποιήσεις σεαυτῷ κιβωτὸν ξυλίνην· καὶ γράψω ἐπὶ
2 τὰς πλάκας τὰ ῥήματα ὅσα ἦν ἐν ταῖς πλαξὶ ταῖς πρώταις αἷς
3 συνέτριψας, καὶ ἐμβαλεῖς αὐτὰς εἰς τὴν κιβωτόν. Καὶ ἐποίησα
κιβωτὸν ἐκ ξύλων ἀσήπτων, καὶ ἐλάξευσα τὰς δύο πλάκας τὰς
λιθίνας ὥσπερ αἱ πρῶται, καὶ ἀνέβην εἰς τὸ ὄρος· καὶ αἱ δύο πλά-
4 κες ἐπὶ ταῖς χερσί μου. Καὶ ἔγραψεν ἐπὶ τὰς πλάκας κατὰ τὴν
γραφὴν τὴν πρώτην τοὺς δέκα λόγους, οὓς ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς
ὑμᾶς ἐν τῷ ὄρει ἐκ μέσου τοῦ πυρὸς ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῆς ἐκκλη-
5 σίας· καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὰς Κύριος ἐμοί. Καὶ ἐπιστρέψας κατέβην
ἐκ τοῦ ὄρους, καὶ ἐνέβαλον τὰς πλάκας εἰς τὴν κιβωτὸν ἣν ἐποί-
6 ησα· καὶ ἦσαν ἐκεῖ, καθὰ ἐνετείλατό μοι Κύριος. Καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσ-
ραὴλ ἀπῆραν ἐκ Βηρὼθ υἱῶν Ἰακείμ Μεισαδαΐ· (καὶ) ἐκεῖ ἀπέθα-
νεν Ἀαρών, καὶ ἐτάφη ἐκεῖ, καὶ ἱεράτευσεν Ἐλεάζαρ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ
7 ἀντ᾽ αὐτοῦ. Ἐκεῖθεν ἀπῆραν εἰς Γαδγάδ, καὶ ἀπὸ Γαδγὰδ εἰς
8 Ἰεταβαθᾶ, γῆ χειμάῤῥου ὑδάτων. Ἐν ἐκείνῳ τῷ καιρῷ διέστειλε
Κύριος τὴν φυλὴν τὴν Λευΐ, αἵρειν τὴν κιβωτὸν τῆς διαθήκης
Κυρίου, παρεστάναι ἔναντι Κυρίου, λειτουργεῖν αὐτῷ, καὶ ἐπεύ-
9 χεσθαι ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι αὐτοῦ ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης. Διὰ τοῦ-
το οὐκ ἔστι τοῖς Λευίταις μερὶς καὶ κλῆρος ἐν τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς αὐτῶν·
Κύριος αὐτὸς κλῆρος αὐτοῦ, καθὰ εἶπε Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου αὐτῷ.
10 Κἀγὼ ἔστην ἐν τῷ ὄρει ὡς ἡμέραι αἱ πρῶται, τεσσαράκοντα ἡ-
μέρας καὶ τεσσαράκοντα νύκτας· καὶ εἰσήκουσε Κύριός μου καὶ
ἐν τῷ καιρῷ τούτῳ, καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησε Κύριος ἐξολεθρεῦσαι ὑμᾶς.
11 Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς μέ· βάδιζε, ἄπαρον ἔναντι τοῦ λαοῦ τοῦ-
του, καὶ εἰσπορευέσθωσαν καὶ κληρονομοίτωσαν τὴν γῆν, ἣν ὤμο-
σα τοῖς πατράσιν αὐτῶν, δοῦναι (αὐτήν) αὐτοῖς. Καὶ νῦν Ἰσραήλ,
τί Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου αἰτεῖται παρὰ σοῦ, ἀλλ᾽ ἢ φοβεῖσθαι Κύ-
ριον τὸν Θεόν σου, πορεύεσθαι ἐν πάσαις ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὐτοῦ, καὶ
ἀγαπᾶν αὐτόν, καὶ λατρεύειν Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ σου ἐξ ὅλης τῆς

The Translation:

DEUTERONOMY CHAPTER 9 (Continued)

...your people, whom you brought forth from the land of Egypt with your great might and your high arm.

CHAPTER 10

1 In that very season, the Lord spoke unto me, saying: "Hew for yourself two tablets of stone, even as the first were, and ascend unto me upon the mountain, and make for yourself an ark of wood; and I shall inscribe upon
2 the tablets the words which were upon the first tablets, those which you did break; and you shall put them within the ark."
3 So I made an ark of imperishable wood and hewed two tablets of stone, even as the first; and I ascended the mountain, having the two tablets in my hands.
4 And He wrote upon the tablets, according to the first writing, the ten words which the Lord had spoken to you on the mountain, from the midst of the fire, on the day of the assembly; and the Lord gave them unto me.
5 Then I turned and descended from the mountain, and I placed the tablets into the ark which I had fashioned; and there they remained, just as the Lord had commanded me.
6 And the sons of Israel journeyed from Beeroth of the sons of Jakan Meisadai; [and] there Aaron died and was buried there, and Eleazar his son did minister as priest in his stead.
7 From thence they journeyed unto Gadgad, and from Gadgad unto Jotbathah, a land of water brooks.
8 In that selfsame season, the Lord set apart the tribe of Levi, to bear the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, to stand before the Lord, to minister unto Him, and to bless in His name, even unto this day.
9 Therefore, the Levites have no portion nor inheritance among their brethren; the Lord Himself is their inheritance, as the Lord your God did speak unto them.
10 And I, even I, stood upon the mountain, as in the former days, for forty days and forty nights; and the Lord heard me at that time also, and the Lord would not destroy you.
11 And the Lord said unto me: "Arise, go forth before this people, that they may enter in and possess the land, which I swore unto their fathers to give [it] unto them."
12 And now, O Israel, what does the Lord your God require of you, save only to fear the Lord your God, to walk in all His ways, and to love Him, and to serve the Lord your God with all your...
