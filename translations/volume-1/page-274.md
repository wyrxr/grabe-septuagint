ταύτην, πεσεῖν ἐν πολέμῳ· αἱ γυναῖκες ἡμῶν καὶ τὰ παιδία ἡμῶν
εἰς διαρπαγὴν ἔσονται· νῦν οὖν βέλτιον ἡμῖν ἐστιν, ἀποστραφῆναι
εἰς Αἴγυπτον. Καὶ εἶπαν ἕτερος τῷ ἑτέρῳ· δῶμεν ἀρχηγὸν, καὶ 4
ἀποστρέψωμεν εἰς Αἴγυπτον. Καὶ ἔπεσε Μωυσῆς καὶ Ἀαρὼν ἐπὶ 5
πρόσωπον αὐτῶν ἐναντίον πάσης ἐκκλησίας συναγωγῆς υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ·
Ἰησοῦς δὲ ὁ τοῦ Ναυῆ, καὶ Χάλεβ ὁ τοῦ Ἰεφοννῆ τῶν κατασκε- 6
ψαμένων τὴν γῆν, διέρρηξαν τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτῶν, καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς πᾶ-
σαν συναγωγὴν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ, λέγοντες· ἡ γῆ ἣν παρήλθομεν ἐν αὐτῇ, 7
καὶ κατεσκευάμεθα αὐτὴν, ἀγαθή ἐστι σφόδρα σφόδρα. Εἰ αἱρετίζει ἡμᾶς 8
Κύριος, εἰσάξει ἡμᾶς εἰς τὴν γῆν ταύτην, καὶ δώσει αὐτὴν ἡμῖν,
γῆ ἥτις ἐστὶ ῥέουσα γάλα καὶ μέλι. Ἀλλὰ ἀπὸ τοῦ Κυρίου μὴ 9
ἀποστάται γίνεσθε· ὑμεῖς δὲ μὴ φοβηθῆτε τὸν λαὸν τῆς γῆς, ὅτι
κατάβρωμα ἡμῖν ἐστιν· ἀφέστηκε γὰρ ὁ καιρὸς αὐτῶν ἀπ᾽ αὐτῶν,
ὁ δὲ Κύριος ἐν ἡμῖν· μὴ φοβηθῆτε αὐτούς. Καὶ εἶπε πᾶσα ἡ συν- 10
αγωγὴ καταλιθοβολῆσαι αὐτοὺς ἐν λίθοις· καὶ ἡ δόξα Κυρίου ὤ-
φθη ἐν νεφέλῃ ἐπὶ τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς υἱοῖς
Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν· ἕως τίνος παροξύνει με 11
ὁ λαὸς οὗτος; καὶ ἕως τίνος οὐ πιστεύσουσί μοι ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς θαυ-
μασίοις, οἷς ἐποίησα ἐν αὐτοῖς; Πατάξω αὐτοὺς θανάτῳ, καὶ ἀπο- 12
λῶ αὐτοὺς, καὶ ποιήσω σε καὶ τὸν οἶκον τοῦ πατρός σου εἰς ἔθνος
μέγα καὶ πολὺ μᾶλλον ἢ τοῦτο. Καὶ εἶπε Μωυσῆς πρὸς Κύριον· 13
καὶ ἀκούσεται Αἴγυπτος, ὅτι ἀνήγαγες ἐν ἰσχύϊ σου τὸν λαὸν τοῦ-
τον ἐξ αὐτῶν· ἀλλὰ καὶ πάντες οἱ κατοικοῦντες ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς ταύ- 14
της ἀκήκοασιν, ὅτι σὺ εἶ Κύριος ἐν τῷ λαῷ τούτῳ, ὅστις ὀφθαλ-
μοὺς κατ᾽ ὀφθαλμοὺς ὀπτάζῃ σὺ Κύριε, καὶ ἡ νεφέλη σου ἐφέστη-
κεν ἐπ᾽ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐν στύλῳ νεφέλης σὺ πορεύῃ πρότερος αὐτῶν
τὴν ἡμέραν, καὶ ἐν στύλῳ πυρὸς τὴν νύκτα· καὶ ἐκτρίψεις τὸν λαὸν 15
τοῦτον ὡσεὶ ἄνθρωπον ἕνα, καὶ ἐροῦσι τὰ ἔθνη ὅσοι ἀκηκόασι τὸ
ὄνομά σου, λέγοντες· παρὰ τὸ μὴ δύνασθαι Κύριον εἰσαγαγεῖν τὸν 16
λαὸν τοῦτον εἰς τὴν γῆν, ἣν ὤμοσεν αὐτοῖς, καὶ κατέστρωσεν αὐ-
τοὺς ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ. Καὶ νῦν ὑψωθήτω ἡ ἰσχύς σου Κύριε, ὃν τρό- 17
πον εἶπας, λέγων· Κύριος μακρόθυμος, καὶ πολυέλεος, καὶ ἀληθι- 18
νὸς, ἀφαιρῶν ἀνομίας καὶ ἀδικίας καὶ ἁμαρτίας, καὶ καθαρισμῷ οὐ
καθαριεῖ τὸν ἔνοχον, ἀποδιδοὺς ἁμαρτίας πατέρων ἐπὶ τέκνα ἕως τρί-
της καὶ τετάρτης γενεᾶς· ἄφες τὴν ἁμαρτίαν τῷ λαῷ τούτῳ κα- 19
τὰ τὸ μέγα ἔλεός σου, καθάπερ ἵλεως ἐγένου αὐτοῖς ἀπ᾽ Αἰγύπτου

### Numbers Chapter 14

**3** this [land], that we should fall in battle; and our wives and our children shall be for a prey. Now therefore, it is better for us to turn back into Egypt.
**4** And they said, one unto another, “Let us appoint a captain, and let us turn back into Egypt.”
**5** Then fell Moses and Aaron upon their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.
**6** And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were among them that had spied out the land, rent their garments;
**7** and they spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, “The land, through which we have passed, [even] in it, and have prepared it, is exceedingly good.
**8** If the Lord delight in us, then He will bring us into this land, and will give it unto us, a land which floweth with milk and honey.
**9** But rebel not against the Lord; neither fear ye the people of the land, for they are bread for us. For their time hath departed from them, and the Lord is with us; fear them not.”
**10** Then all the congregation said, to stone them with stones. And the glory of the Lord appeared in a cloud over the tabernacle of testimony, before all the children of Israel.

**11** And the Lord said unto Moses, “How long shall this people provoke Me? And how long will they not believe Me, despite all the wondrous works which I have wrought among them?
**12** I will smite them with death, and destroy them, and I will make thee and the house of thy father into a nation great and more numerous than this [one].”
**13** And Moses said unto the Lord, “Then Egypt shall hear [of it], that Thou hast brought up this people from among them by Thy might;
**14** yea, all they that dwell upon this land have heard that Thou, O Lord, art in the midst of this people, and that Thou, O Lord, dost appear eye to eye, and that Thy cloud standeth over them, and in a pillar of cloud Thou goest before them by day, and in a pillar of fire by night.
**15** Now if Thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the nations, as many as have heard Thy Name, will speak, saying:
**16** ‘Because the Lord was not able to bring this people into the land which He sware unto them, He hath laid them low in the wilderness.’
**17** And now, I pray thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as Thou hast spoken, saying:
**18** ‘The Lord is longsuffering, and of great mercy, and true, taking away iniquities and unrighteousness and sins, and by no means will He cleanse the guilty, repaying the sins of fathers upon children unto the third and fourth generation.’
**19** Pardon, I beseech Thee, the sin of this people, according to Thy great mercy, just as Thou hast been gracious unto them from Egypt.”
