270 ΑΡΙΘΜΟΙ· ΚΕΦ. ΙΗ΄. ΙΘ΄.
ἀφελεῖτε ὑμεῖς ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἀφαίρεμα Κυρίῳ, ἐπιδέκατον ἀπὸ τοῦ
27 ἐπιδεκάτου· καὶ λογισθήσεται ὑμῖν τὰ ἀφαιρέματα ὑμῶν ὡς σῖ-
28 τος ἀφ᾿ ἅλωνος, καὶ ὡς ἀφαίρεμα ἀπὸ ληνοῦ. Οὕτως ἀφελεῖτε
καὶ ὑμεῖς ἀπὸ πάντων ἀφαιρεμάτων Κυρίου ἀπὸ πάντων ἐπιδε-
κάτων ὑμῶν, ὅσα ἂν λάβητε παρὰ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ δώ-
29 σετε ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν ἀφαίρεμα Κυρίου Ἀαρὼν τῷ ἱερεῖ· ἀπὸ πάντων
τῶν δομάτων ὑμῶν ἀφελεῖτε πᾶν ἀφαίρεμα Κυρίῳ, ἀπὸ πάντων
30 τῶν ἀπαρχῶν τὸ ἡγιασμένον αὐτῷ ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς
αὐτούς· ὅταν ἀφαιρῆτε τὴν ἀπαρχὴν αὐτοῦ ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ λο-
γισθήσεται τοῖς Λευίταις ὡς γέννημα ἀπὸ ἅλωνος, καὶ ὡς γέννημα ἀπὸ
31 ληνοῦ. Καὶ ἔδεσθε αὐτὸ ἐν παντὶ τόπῳ, ὑμεῖς (καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ ὑμῶν,) καὶ οἱ
32 οἶκοι ὑμῶν, ὅτι μισθὸς οὗτος ὑμῖν ἐστιν ἀντὶ τῶν λειτουργιῶν ὑμῶν
τῶν ἐν τῇ σκηνῇ τοῦ μαρτυρίου. Καὶ οὐ λήψεσθε δι᾿ αὐτὸ ἁμαρτίαν,
ὅτι ἂν ἀφαιρῆτε τὴν ἀπαρχὴν αὐτοῦ ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ· καὶ τὰ ἅγια
τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ οὐ βεβηλώσετε, ἵνα μὴ ἀποθάνητε.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΘ΄. ΧΙΧ.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν καὶ Ἀαρών, λέγων·
2 αὕτη ἡ διαστολὴ τοῦ νόμου, ὅσα συνέταξε Κύριος, λέγων· λάλησον
τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ λαβέτωσαν πρός σὲ δάμαλιν πυρρὰν ἄμω-
μον, ἥτις οὐκ ἔχει ἐν ἑαυτῇ μῶμον, καὶ ᾗ οὐκ ἐπεβλήθη ἐπ᾿
3 αὐτὴν ζυγός· καὶ δώσεις αὐτὴν πρὸς Ἐλεάζαρ τὸν ἱερέα· καὶ ἐξά-
ξουσιν αὐτὴν ἔξω τῆς παρεμβολῆς εἰς τόπον καθαρόν, καὶ σφά-
4 ξουσιν αὐτὴν ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ. Καὶ λήψεται Ἐλεάζαρ ὁ ἱερεὺς
ἀπὸ τοῦ αἵματος αὐτῆς τῷ δακτύλῳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ῥανεῖ ἀπέναντι
τοῦ προσώπου τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου ἀπὸ τοῦ αἵματος αὐ-
5 τῆς ἑπτάκις. Καὶ κατακαύσουσιν αὐτὴν ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὸ δέρμα
αὐτῆς, καὶ τὰ κρέα αὐτῆς, καὶ τὸ αἷμα αὐτῆς σὺν τῇ κόπρῳ αὐ-
6 τῆς κατακαυθήσεται. Καὶ λήψεται ὁ ἱερεὺς ξύλον κέδρινον, καὶ
ὕσσωπον, καὶ κόκκινον, καὶ ἐμβαλοῦσιν εἰς μέσον τοῦ κατακαύμα-
7 τος τῆς δαμάλεως· καὶ πλυνεῖ τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ ὁ ἱερεύς, καὶ
λούσεται τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ ὕδατι· καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα εἰσελεύσεται εἰς
8 τὴν παρεμβολήν, καὶ ἀκάθαρτος ἔσται ὁ ἱερεὺς ἕως ἑσπέρας. Καὶ
ὁ κατακαίων αὐτήν, πλυνεῖ τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ ἐν ὕδατι, καὶ λού-
σεται τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ ἐν ὕδατι· καὶ ἀκάθαρτος ἔσται ἕως τῆς

**NUMBERS CHAPTER 18**

27 And from it shall ye set apart a heave offering unto the Lord, a tenth part of the tithe. And it shall be reckoned unto you, even your heave offerings, as [though it were] the corn
28 of the threshing floor, and as the heave offering from the winepress. Thus also shall ye set apart,
even ye, from all the heave offerings of the Lord, from all your tithes, whatsoever ye shall receive from the sons of Israel; and ye shall give
29 from these a heave offering of the Lord unto Aaron the priest. From all your gifts shall ye set apart every heave offering unto the Lord, from all
30 the firstfruits, the hallowed portion thereof unto Him. And thou shalt say unto them, When ye set apart the firstfruit thereof, then
it shall be reckoned to the Levites as the produce of the threshing floor, and as the produce of the
31 winepress. And ye shall eat it in every place, ye (and your sons), and your
32 households; for this is your reward in return for your ministrations within the tabernacle of testimony. And ye shall bear no sin on account of it, if ye set apart the firstfruit thereof; and ye shall not profane the holy things of the sons of Israel, lest ye die.

**CHAPTER 19**

1 AND the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
2 "This is the ordinance of the law, whatsoever the Lord has commanded, saying: Speak thou unto the sons of Israel, and let them bring unto thee a red heifer, unblemished, which has no blemish within herself, and upon which no yoke has ever been laid.
3 And thou shalt give her unto Eleazar the priest; and they shall bring her forth outside the camp into a clean place, and they shall slaughter her before him.
4 And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and shall sprinkle of her blood seven times before the face of the tabernacle of testimony.
5 And they shall burn her in his sight: her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall be burned up.
6 And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet [thread], and they shall cast them into the midst of the burning
7 of the heifer. And the priest shall wash his garments, and shall bathe his body in water; and after this he shall enter into
8 the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the evening. And he that burns her shall wash his garments in water, and shall bathe his body in water; and he shall be unclean until the
