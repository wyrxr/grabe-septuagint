23 λέγοντες· ἐξάγαγε τὸν ἄνδρα τὸν ἐλθόντα εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν σου, ἵνα
γνῶμεν αὐτόν. Καὶ ἐξῆλθε πρὸς αὐτοὺς ὁ ἀνὴρ ὁ κύριος τῆς οἰκίας,
καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτούς· μηδαμῶς ἀδελφοί μου, μὴ ποιήσησθε δὴ
μετὰ τὸ εἰσελθεῖναι τὸν ἄνδρα τοῦτον εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν 24 μου· μὴ
ποιήσητε τὴν ἀφροσύνην ταύτην. Ἰδοὺ ἡ θυγάτηρ μου ἡ παρθένος,
καὶ ἡ παλλακὴ αὐτοῦ· ἐξάξω δὴ αὐτὰς καὶ ταπεινώσατε αὐτὰς, καὶ
ποιήσατε αὐταῖς τὸ ἀγαθὸν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς ὑμῶν· καὶ τῷ ἀνδρὶ
τούτῳ μὴ ποιήσητε τὸ ῥῆμα τῆς ἀφροσύνης ταύτης. 25 Καὶ οὐκ
ἠθέλησαν οἱ ἄνδρες ἀκοῦσαι αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐπελάβετο ὁ ἀνὴρ τῆς
παλλακῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐξήγαγεν αὐτὴν πρὸς αὐτοὺς ἔξω· καὶ ἔγνωσαν
αὐτὴν, καὶ ἐνέπαιξαν αὐτῇ ὅλην τὴν νύκτα ἕως πρωΐ, 26 καὶ
ἐξαπέστειλαν αὐτὴν ἅμα τῷ ἀναβαίνειν τὸν ὄρθρον. Καὶ ἦλθεν ἡ
γυνὴ τὸ πρὸς πρωΐ, καὶ ἔπεσε παρὰ τὴν θύραν τοῦ πυλῶνος τοῦ
οἴκου τοῦ ἀνδρὸς οὗ ἦν ὁ κύριος αὐτῆς ἔχει, ἕως οὗ διέφωσε. 27 Καὶ
ἀνέστη ὁ κύριος αὐτῆς τὸ πρωΐ, καὶ ἤνοιξε τὰς θύρας τοῦ οἴκου, καὶ
ἐξῆλθε τοῦ ἀπελθεῖν τὴν ὁδὸν αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἰδοὺ ἡ γυνὴ (αὐτοῦ) ἡ
παλλακὴ αὐτοῦ πεπτωκυῖα παρὰ τὴν θύραν, καὶ αἱ χεῖρες αὐτῆς ἐπὶ
τὸ πρόθυρον. 28 Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτήν· ἀνάστηθι καὶ ἀπέλθωμεν· καὶ
οὐκ ἀπεκρίθη αὐτῷ, ἀλλὰ τεθνήκει. Καὶ ἀνέλαβεν αὐτὴν ἐπὶ τὸ
ὑποζύγιον, καὶ ἀνέστη ὁ ἀνὴρ, καὶ ἀπῆλθεν εἰς 29 τὸν τόπον αὐτοῦ.
Καὶ ἦλθεν εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔλαβε τὴν μάχαιραν, καὶ
ἐπελάβετο τῆς παλλακῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐμέλισεν αὐτὴν κατὰ τὰ ὀστᾶ
αὐτῆς εἰς δώδεκα μερίδας· καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν 30 αὐτὰς εἰς πάσας τὰς
φυλὰς τοῦ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἐγένετο πᾶς ὁ ὁρῶν ἔλεγεν· οὔτε ἐγενήθη,
οὔτε ὤφθη οὕτως ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέρας ἀναβάσεως υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ ἐκ γῆς
Αἰγύπτου ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης. Καὶ ἐνετείλατο τοῖς ἀνδράσιν οἷς
ἐξαπέστειλε, λέγων· τάδε ἐρεῖτε πρὸς πάντα ἄνδρα Ἰσραήλ· εἰ
γέγονε κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέρας ἀναβάσεως υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ
ἐξ Αἰγύπτου ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης· Θέσθε δὴ ἑαυτοῖς βουλὴν περὶ
αὐτῆς, καὶ λαλήσατε.

### Judges Chapter 19

**23.** Saying, "Bring forth the man that hath come into thy house, that we may know him."

And the man, the master of the house, went forth unto them, and said unto them, "Nay, my brethren, do not ye, I pray you, commit this thing, after this man hath come into my house; do not commit this folly.

**24.** Behold, my daughter, a virgin, and his concubine; I will bring them forth now, and humble them, and do unto them that which is good in your eyes; but unto this man do not commit this act of folly."

**25.** But the men would not hearken unto him; and the man took hold of his concubine, and brought her forth unto them outside; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until morning;

**26.** and they let her go at the rising of the dawn. And the woman came towards morning, and fell down by the door of the gate of the house of the man where her master was, [and] maintained [his dwelling], until it grew light.

**27.** And her master rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went forth to go on his way; and behold, his woman, (his own), his concubine, lay fallen by the door, and her hands were upon the threshold.

**28.** And he said unto her, "Arise, and let us depart." But she answered him not, for she was dead. And he took her up upon the ass, and the man rose up, and departed unto his own place.

**29.** And when he came to his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and dismembered her according to her bones into twelve pieces; and he sent them throughout all the tribes of Israel.

**30.** And it came to pass, that every one that saw it said, "There hath neither been, nor been seen, such a thing as this, from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt until this day." And he commanded the men whom he sent, saying, "Thus shall ye say unto every man of Israel: If such a thing hath happened according to this word from the day that the children of Israel came up out of Egypt until this day, then set ye for yourselves counsel concerning it, and speak ye."
