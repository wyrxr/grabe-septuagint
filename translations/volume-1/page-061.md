46 ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ· ΚΕΦ. ΚΖ΄.
22 λαφήσω σε τέκνον, εἰ σὺ εἶ ὁ υἱός μου Ἠσαῦ, ἢ οὔ. Ἤγγισε δὲ
23 Ἰακὼβ πρὸς Ἰσαὰκ τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐψηλάφησεν αὐτὸν, καὶ
24 εἶπεν· ἡ φωνὴ, φωνὴ Ἰακώβ· αἱ δὲ χεῖρες, χεῖρες Ἠσαῦ. Καὶ
25 οὐκ ἐπέγνω αὐτόν· ἦσαν γὰρ αἱ χεῖρες αὐτοῦ ὡς αἱ χεῖρες Ἠ-
26 σαῦ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ δασεῖαι· καὶ ηὐλόγησεν αὐτόν. Καὶ εἶπε·
27 σὺ εἶ ὁ υἱός μου Ἠσαῦ; Ὁ δὲ εἶπεν· ἐγώ. Καὶ εἶπε· προσά-
28 γαγέ μοι, καὶ φάγομαι ἀπὸ τῆς θήρας σου τέκνον, ὅπως εὐλο-
29 γήσῃ σε ἡ ψυχή μου. Καὶ προσήνεγκεν αὐτῷ, καὶ ἔφαγε· καὶ
30 εἰσήνεγκεν αὐτῷ οἶνον, καὶ ἔπιε. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Ἰσαὰκ ὁ πα-
31 τὴρ αὐτοῦ· ἔγγισόν μοι, καὶ φίλησόν με, τέκνον. Καὶ ἐγγίσας
32 ἐφίλησεν αὐτόν· καὶ ὠσφράνθη τὴν ὀσμὴν τῶν ἱματίων αὐτοῦ, καὶ
33 ηὐλόγησεν αὐτόν, καὶ εἶπεν· Ἰδοὺ ὀσμὴ τοῦ υἱοῦ μου, ὡς ὀσμὴ
34 ἀγροῦ πλήρους, ὃν ηὐλόγησε Κύριος· καὶ δῴη σοι ὁ Θεὸς ἀπὸ τῆς
35 δρόσου τοῦ οὐρανοῦ (ἄνωθεν), καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς πιότητος τῆς γῆς,
36 καὶ πλῆθος σίτου καὶ οἴνου· καὶ δουλευσάτωσάν σοι ἔθνη, καὶ
37 προσκυνήσουσί σοι ἄρχοντες· καὶ γίνου κύριος τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου,
38 καὶ προσκυνήσουσί σε οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ πατρός σου· ὁ καταρώμενός σε,
39 ἐπικατάρατος· ὁ δὲ εὐλογῶν σε, εὐλογημένος. Καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ
40 τὸ παύσασθαι Ἰσαὰκ εὐλογοῦντα τὸν Ἰακὼβ τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ
41 ἐγένετο ὡς ἐξῆλθεν Ἰακὼβ ἀπὸ προσώπου Ἰσαὰκ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐ-
42 τοῦ, καὶ Ἠσαῦ ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ ἦλθεν ἀπὸ τῆς θήρας αὐτοῦ.
43 Καὶ ἐποίησε καὶ αὐτὸς ἐδέσματα, καὶ προσήνεγκε τῷ πατρὶ αὐ-
44 τοῦ· καὶ εἶπε τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ· ἀναστήτω ὁ πατήρ μου, καὶ φα-
45 γέτω ἀπὸ τῆς θήρας τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ, ὅπως εὐλογήσῃ με ἡ ψυχή
46 σου. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Ἰσαὰκ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ· τίς εἶ σύ; Ὁ δὲ
47 εἶπεν· ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ υἱός σου ὁ πρωτότοκος Ἠσαῦ. Ἐξέστη δὲ Ἰ-
48 σαὰκ ἔκστασιν μεγάλην σφόδρα, καὶ εἶπε· τίς οὖν ὁ θηρεύσας μοι
49 θήραν καὶ εἰσενέγκας μοι; καὶ ἔφαγον ἀπὸ πάντων πρὸ τοῦ σε
50 εἰσελθεῖν, καὶ ηὐλόγησα αὐτὸν, καὶ εὐλογημένος ἔσται. Ἐγένετο
51 δὲ ἡνίκα ἤκουσεν Ἠσαῦ τὰ ῥήματα Ἰσαὰκ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ,
52 ἀνεβόησεν (Ἠσαῦ) φωνὴν μεγάλην καὶ πικρὰν σφόδρα, καὶ εἶπε
53 τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ· εὐλόγησον δὴ κἀμέ, πάτερ. Εἶπε δὲ αὐτῷ· ἐλ-
54 θὼν ὁ ἀδελφός σου μετὰ δόλου, ἔλαβε τὴν εὐλογίαν σου. Καὶ εἶ-
55 πε· δικαίως ἐκλήθη τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ἰακώβ· ἐπτέρνικε γάρ με ἤ-
56 δη δεύτερον τοῦτο· τά τε πρωτοτοκεῖά μου εἴληφε, καὶ νῦν εἴ-
57 ληφε τὴν εὐλογίαν μου. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἠσαῦ τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ· οὐχ

**Genesis 27**

<p><sup>22</sup> I shall feel thee, my son, [to know] whether thou art my son Esau, or no. And Jacob drew near
<sup>23</sup> unto Isaac his father, and he felt him, and
<sup>24</sup> he said, “The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.”
<sup>25</sup> And he knew him not, for his hands were hairy, as the hands
<sup>26</sup> of Esau his brother; and he blessed him. And he said,
<sup>27</sup> “Art thou my son Esau?” And he said, “I am.” And he said, “Bring [it] near
<sup>28</sup> unto me, and I will eat of thy hunting, my son, that my soul may bless thee.”
<sup>29</sup> And he brought [it] near unto him, and he did eat; and
<sup>30</sup> he brought him wine, and he drank. And Isaac his father said unto him,
<sup>31</sup> “Draw near unto me, and kiss me, my son.” And he drew near
<sup>32</sup> [and] kissed him; and he smelled the smell of his garments, and
<sup>33</sup> he blessed him, and said, “Behold, the smell of my son is as the smell of
<sup>34</sup> a full field which the Lord hath blessed; and may God give thee of the
<sup>35</sup> dew of heaven (from above), and of the fatness of the earth,
<sup>36</sup> and abundance of grain and wine; and let nations serve thee, and
<sup>37</sup> rulers shall bow down before thee; and be thou lord over thy brother,
<sup>38</sup> and the sons of thy father shall bow down before thee. He that curseth thee,
<sup>39</sup> [shall be] accursed; and he that blesseth thee, [shall be] blessed.” And it came to pass, after
<sup>40</sup> Isaac had ceased blessing Jacob his son, and
<sup>41</sup> it came to pass, as Jacob went out from the presence of Isaac his father,
<sup>42</sup> that Esau his brother came from his hunting.
<sup>43</sup> And he also made savory dishes, and brought [them] to his father;
<sup>44</sup> and he said unto his father, “Let my father arise, and eat
<sup>45</sup> of the hunting of his son, that thy soul may bless me.”
<sup>46</sup> And Isaac his father said unto him, “Who art thou?” And he
<sup>47</sup> said, “I am thy son, thy firstborn, Esau.” Then Isaac was greatly
<sup>48</sup> astonished, with a great astonishment, and said, “Who then is he that hunted for me
<sup>49</sup> game and brought [it] unto me? And I did eat of all before thou
<sup>50</sup> camest in, and I blessed him; and blessed shall he be.” And it came to pass,
<sup>51</sup> when Esau heard the words of Isaac his father,
<sup>52</sup> [Esau] cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said
<sup>53</sup> unto his father, “Bless me, even me also, O father!” And he said unto him, “Thy brother came with
<sup>54</sup> deceit, and hath taken thy blessing.” And he said,
<sup>55</sup> “Rightly is his name called Jacob, for he hath now supplanted me
<sup>56</sup> this second time; he hath taken away my birthright, and now he hath taken away
<sup>57</sup> my blessing.” And Esau said unto his father, “Hast thou not</p>
