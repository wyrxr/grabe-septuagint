ΚΕΦ. Β΄. ΙΗΣΟΥΣ ΝΑΥΗ 377
5 (ὧδε) οἱ ἄνδρες, καὶ οὐκ οἶδα, πόθεν ἦσαν. Ὡς δὲ ἡ πύλη ἐκλείετο ἐν τῷ σκότει, καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες ἐξῆλθον· οὐκ ἐπίσταμαι ποῦ
πεπόρευται οἱ ἄνδρες· καταδιώξατε ταχέως ὀπίσω αὐτῶν, εἰ καταλήψεσθε αὐτούς. 6 Αὕτη δὲ ἀνεβίβασεν αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ τὸ δῶμα, καὶ
ἔκρυψεν αὐτοὺς ἐν τῇ λινοκαλάμῃ τῇ ἐστοιβασμένῃ αὐτῇ ἐπὶ τοῦ
δώματος. 7 Καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες κατεδίωξαν ὀπίσω αὐτῶν ὁδὸν τὴν ἐπὶ
τοῦ Ἰορδάνου ἐπὶ τὰς διαβάσεις, καὶ ἡ πύλη ἐκλείσθη. 8 Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἐξῆλθον οἱ καταδιώκοντες ὀπίσω αὐτῶν, καὶ αὐτοὶ πρὶν ἢ
κοιμηθῆναι αὐτούς, 9 καὶ αὕτη ἀνέβη πρὸς αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ τὸ δῶμα, καὶ
εἶπε πρὸς αὐτούς· ἐπίσταμαι ὅτι ἔδωκε Κύριος ὑμῖν τὴν γῆν· ἐπι-
πέπτωκε γὰρ ὁ φόβος ὑμῶν πρὸς ἡμᾶς, καὶ ὅτι κατέπτησσον πάν-
τες οἱ κατοικοῦντες ἐν τῇ γῇ ἀπὸ προσώπου ὑμῶν. 10 ᾿Ακηκόαμεν
γὰρ ὅτι κατεξήρανε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τὴν θάλασσαν τὴν ἐρυθρὰν
ἀπὸ προσώπου ὑμῶν, ὅτε ἐξεπορεύεσθε ἐξ Αἰγύπτου, καὶ ὅσα
ἐποίησε τοῖς δυσὶ βασιλεῦσι τῶν ᾿Αμορραίων, οἳ ἦσαν πέραν τοῦ
Ἰορδάνου, τῷ Σηὼν καὶ Ὤγ, οὓς ἐξωλοθρεύσατε αὐτούς· 11 καὶ ἀ-
κούσαντες ἡμεῖς ἐξέστημεν τῇ καρδίᾳ ἡμῶν, καὶ οὐκ ἔστη ἔτι
πνεῦμα ἐν οὐδενὶ ἀπὸ προσώπου ὑμῶν· ὅτι Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν
αὐτός ἐστι Θεὸς ἐν οὐρανῷ ἄνω, καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς κάτω. 12 Καὶ νῦν
ὀμόσατέ μοι Κύριον τὸν Θεόν, ὅτι ποιῶ ὑμῖν ἔλεος, καὶ ποιήσατε
καὶ ὑμεῖς ἔλεος ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ πατρός μου, καὶ δώσετέ μοι ση-
μεῖον ἀληθινόν. 13 Καὶ ζωγρήσατε τὸν οἶκον τοῦ πατρός μου, καὶ
τὴν μητέρα μου, καὶ τοὺς ἀδελφούς μου καὶ τὰς ἀδελφάς μου,
καὶ πάντα τὸν οἶκόν μου, καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐστὶν αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἐξε-
λέσθε τὴν ψυχήν μου ἐκ θανάτου. 14 Καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῇ οἱ ἄνδρες· ἡ
ψυχὴ ἡμῶν ἀνθ᾿ ὑμῶν εἰς θάνατον, ἐὰν μὴ ἀναγγείλητε τὸ ῥῆ-
μα ἡμῶν τοῦτο. Καὶ αὕτη εἶπεν· ὡς ἂν παραδῷ Κύριος ὑμῖν
τὴν πόλιν, ποιήσατε μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ ἔλεος καὶ ἀλήθειαν. 15 Καὶ κατεχά-
λασεν αὐτοὺς ἐν σχοινίῳ διὰ τῆς θυρίδος· ἔτι δ᾿ οἶκος αὐτῆς ἐν
τῷ τείχει, καὶ ἐν τῷ τείχει αὕτη κατῴκει. 16 Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς·
εἰς τὴν ὀρεινὴν ἀπέλθατε, μὴ συναντήσωσιν ὑμῖν οἱ καταδιώκοντες,
καὶ κρυβήσεσθε ἐκεῖ τρεῖς ἡμέρας, ἕως ἀναστρέψωσιν οἱ καταδιώ-
κοντες ὀπίσω ὑμῶν· καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα ἀπελεύσεσθε εἰς τὴν ὁδὸν
ὑμῶν. 17 Καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς αὐτὴν οἱ ἄνδρες· ἀθῶοι ἐσμέν τῷ ὅρκῳ
σου τούτῳ, ᾧ ὥρκισας ἡμᾶς· 18 ἰδοὺ ἡμεῖς εἰσπορευόμεθα εἰς μέρος
τῆς πόλεως, καὶ θήσεις τὸ σημεῖον, τὸ σπαρτίον τὸ κόκινον τοῦτο

5 "(here) the men, and I wist not whence they were. But as the gate was shutting in the darkness, the men went out; I know not whither the men have gone. Pursue ye swiftly after them, if perchance ye shall overtake them." 6 But she had brought them up unto the roof, and hid them in the stalks of flax that were piled up for her upon the roof.

7 And the men pursued after them along the way that leadeth unto Jordan, to the fords; and the gate was shut. 8 And it came to pass, when they that pursued after them were gone out, 9 and they themselves, before they lay down to sleep, that she went up unto them upon the roof, and spake unto them, saying: "I know that the Lord hath given you the land; for your fear hath fallen upon us, and all the inhabitants of the land are sore dismayed before you. 10 For we have heard how that the Lord God dried up the Red Sea before you, when ye came forth out of Egypt; and what He did unto the two kings of the Amorites, which were beyond Jordan, unto Sihon and unto Og, whom ye utterly destroyed. 11 And when we heard these things, our hearts did melt within us, and there remained no spirit in any man because of you; for the Lord your God, He is God in heaven above, and on earth beneath.

12 Now therefore, swear unto me by the Lord your God, that as I have shown kindness unto you, so shall ye also show kindness unto the house of my father, and give me a true sign. 13 And that ye shall preserve alive the house of my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver my soul from death."

14 And the men said unto her, "Our lives for yours unto death, if ye do not utter this word of ours." And she said, "When the Lord shall deliver unto you the city, then shall ye deal kindly and truly with me." 15 And she let them down by a rope through the window; for her house was built upon the wall, and she dwelt within the wall.

16 And she said unto them, "Get ye to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet with you; and ye shall hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned from after you; and afterward ye shall go your way."

17 And the men said unto her, "We shall be guiltless of this oath of thine wherewith thou hast made us swear. 18 Behold, when we enter into a part of the city, then shalt thou set this sign, even this scarlet cord, binding it in the window through which thou didst let us down."
