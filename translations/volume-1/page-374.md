ΚΕΦ. ΚΗ. ΔΕΥΤΕΡΟΝΟΜΙΟΝ 359
λογήσει σε ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, ἧς Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου δίδωσι σοι. ᾽Ανα- 9
στήσαι σε Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου ἑαυτῷ λαὸν ἅγιον, ὃν τρόπον ὤμοσε
τοῖς πατράσι σου, ἐὰν εἰσακούσῃς τῆς φωνῆς Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ σου,
καὶ πορευθῇς ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὐτοῦ· καὶ ὄψονται σε πάντα τὰ ἔ- 10
θνη τῆς γῆς, ἔτι τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου ἐπικέκληταί σοι, καὶ φοβηθή-
σονταί σε. Καὶ πληθυνεῖ σε Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου εἰς ἀγαθὰ ἐπὶ 11
τοῖς ἐκγόνοις τῆς κοιλίας σου, καὶ ἐπὶ τοῖς ἐκγόνοις τῶν κτη-
νῶν σου, καὶ ἐπὶ τοῖς γεννήμασι τῆς γῆς σου ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, ἧς
ὤμοσε Κύριος τοῖς πατράσι σου, δοῦναί σοι. ᾽Ανοίξαι σοι Κύριος 12
τὸν θησαυρόν τὸν ἀγαθὸν αὐτοῦ, τὸν οὐρανόν, δοῦναι τὸν ὑετὸν
τῇ γῇ σου ἐπὶ καιροῦ αὐτοῦ, εὐλογήσαι πάντα τὰ ἔργα τῶν χει-
ρῶν σου καὶ ἐκδανειεῖς ἔθνεσι πολλοῖς, σὺ δὲ οὐ δανειῇ· καὶ ἄρξεις
σὺ ἐθνῶν πολλῶν, σοῦ δὲ οὐχ ἄρξουσι. Καταστήσαι σε Κύριος 13
ὁ Θεός σου εἰς κεφαλήν, καὶ μὴ εἰς οὐράν· καὶ ἔσῃ τότε ἐπάνω,
καὶ οὐκ ἔσῃ ὑποκάτω, ἐὰν ἀκούσῃς τῶν ἐντολῶν Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ
σου, ὅσα ἐγὼ ἐντέλλομαί σοι σήμερον φυλάσσειν καὶ ποιεῖν· οὐ παρα- 14
βήσῃ ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν λόγων, ὧν ἐγὼ ἐντέλλομαί σοι σήμερον,
δεξιὰ ἢ ἀριστερά, πορεύεσθαι ὀπίσω θεῶν ἑτέρων, λατρεύειν αὐτοῖς.
Καὶ ἔσται ἐὰν μὴ εἰσακούσῃς τῆς φωνῆς Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ σου, 15
φυλάσσειν καὶ ποιεῖν πάσας τὰς ἐντολὰς αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰ ἠκριβασμένα
αὐτοῦ, ὅσα ἐγὼ ἐντέλλομαί σοι σήμερον, καὶ ἐλεύσονται ἐπὶ σὲ
πᾶσαι αἱ κατάραι αὗται, καὶ καταλήψονταί σε. ᾽Επικατάρατος σὺ 16
ἐν πόλει, καὶ ἐπικατάρατος σὺ ἐν ἀγρῷ· ἐπικατάρατοι αἱ ἀποθῆ- 17
και σου, καὶ τὰ ἐγκαταλείμματά σου· ἐπικατάρατα τὰ ἔκγονα 18
τῆς κοιλίας σου, καὶ τὰ γεννήματα τῆς γῆς σου, τὰ βουκόλια τῶν
βοῶν σου, καὶ τὰ ποίμνια τῶν προβάτων σου· ἐπικατάρατος σὺ ἐν 19
τῷ εἰσπορεύεσθαί σε, καὶ ἐπικατάρατος σὺ ἐν τῷ ἐκπορεύεσθαί σε.
᾽Εξαποστείλαι Κύριός σοι τὴν ἔνδειαν καὶ τὴν ἔκλιψιν καὶ τὴν 20
ἀνάλωσιν ἐπὶ πάντα οὗ ἐὰν ἐπιβάλῃς τὴν χεῖρά σου, ὅσα ἐὰν
ποιήσῃς, ἕως ἂν ἐξολοθρεύσῃ σε, καὶ ἕως ἀπολέσῃ σε ἐν τάχει
διὰ τὰ πονηρὰ ἐπιτηδεύματά σου, διότι ἐγκατέλιπας με. Προσοκολ- 21
λήσαι Κύριος εἰς σὲ τὸν θάνατον, ἕως ἂν ἐξαναλώσῃ σε ἀπὸ τῆς
γῆς, εἰς ἣν σὺ εἰσπορεύῃ ἐκεῖ, κληρονομήσαι αὐτήν. Πατάξαι σε 22
Κύριος ἀπορία, καὶ πυρετῷ, καὶ ῥίγει, καὶ ἐρεθισμῷ, καὶ φόνῳ,
καὶ ἀνεμοφθορίᾳ, καὶ τῇ ὤχρᾳ, καὶ καταδιώξονται σε ἕως ἂν ἀπο-
λέσωσί σε. Καὶ ἔσται ὁ οὐρανὸς ὁ ὑπὲρ κεφαλῆς σου, χαλκοῦς, 23

### Deuteronomy Chapter 28

**The Blessings of Obedience**

9 May the Lord your God raise you up unto Himself a holy people, even as He swore unto your fathers, if you shall hearken unto the voice of the Lord your God, and walk in His ways.
10 And all the nations of the earth shall see you, and [discern] that the Name of the Lord is called upon you, and they shall be afraid of you.
11 And the Lord your God shall multiply you unto abundant good, in the fruit of your womb, and in the increase of your livestock, and in the produce of your land, in the land which the Lord swore unto your fathers to give you.
12 May the Lord open unto you His good treasury, the heaven, to give the rain unto your land in its season, and to bless all the works of your hands; and you shall lend unto many nations, but you shall not borrow.
13 And you shall rule over many nations, but they shall not rule over you. May the Lord your God set you as the head, and not as the tail; and you shall be above, and you shall not be beneath, if you hearken unto the commandments of the Lord your God, all that I command you this day, to keep and to do them;
14 [And] you shall not turn aside from any of the words which I command you this day, neither to the right hand nor to the left, to go after other gods, to serve them.

**The Curses of Disobedience**

15 But it shall come to pass, if you shall not hearken unto the voice of the Lord your God, to keep and to do all His commandments and His precise ordinances, all that I command you this day, then all these curses shall come upon you, and shall overtake you.
16 Cursed shall you be in the city, and cursed shall you be in the field.
17 Cursed shall be your storehouses, and all your provisions.
18 Cursed shall be the fruit of your womb, and the produce of your land, the herds of your cattle, and the flocks of your sheep.
19 Cursed shall you be when you come in, and cursed shall you be when you go out.
20 The Lord shall send upon you scarcity, and failing, and utter consumption in all to which you set your hand, and in all that you shall do, until He shall utterly destroy you, and until He shall cause you to perish swiftly, because of your wicked practices, for you have forsaken Me.
21 The Lord shall make death cleave unto you, until He shall consume you from off the land into which you go to possess it.
22 The Lord shall smite you with wasting sickness, and with fever, and with chills, and with grievous inflammation, and with deadly plague, and with blasting wind, and with pallor; and these shall pursue you until they shall destroy you.
23 And the heaven that is above your head shall be as bronze,
