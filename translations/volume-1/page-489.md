**12.** ἐπιστράφητε δὴ θυγατέρες μου διὰ τοῦτο, διότι γεγήρακα τοῦ μὴ
    εἶναι ἀνδρί. Ὅτι εἶπα, ὅτι ἔστί μοι ὑπόστασις τοῦ γενηθῆναί με
**13.** ἀνδρί, καὶ τέξομαι υἱούς· μὴ αὐτοὺς προσδέξεσθε ἕως οὗ ἀδρυν-
    θῶσιν; ἢ αὐτοῖς κατασχεθήσεσθε, τοῦ μὴ γενέσθαι ἀνδρί; μὴ δὴ
    θυγατέρες μου, ἔτι ἐπικράνθη μοι σφόδρα ὑπὲρ ὑμᾶς, ὅτι ἐξῆλθεν
**14.** ἐν ἐμοὶ χεὶρ Κυρίου. Καὶ ἐπῆραν τὴν φωνὴν αὐτῶν καὶ ἔκλαυσαν
    ἔτι, καὶ κατεφίλησεν Ὀρφὰ τὴν πενθερὰν αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν
**15.** εἰς τὸν λαὸν αὐτῆς· Ῥοὺθ δὲ ἠκολούθησεν αὐτῇ. Καὶ εἶπε Νοεμ-
    μεὶν πρὸς Ῥούθ· Ἰδοὺ ἀνέτρεψεν ἡ σύννυμφός σου πρὸς λαὸν αὐτῆς
    καὶ πρὸς τοὺς θεοὺς αὐτῆς, ἐπιστράφηθι δὴ καὶ σὺ ὀπίσω τῆς
**16.** συννύμφου σου. Εἶπε δὲ Ῥούθ· μὴ ἀπάντησαί μοι τοῦ καταλιπεῖν σε,
    ἢ ἀποστρέψαι ὄπισθέν σου, ὅτι ὅπου ἐὰν πορευθῇς, πορεύσομαι, καὶ
    οὗ ἐὰν αὐλισθῇς, αὐλισθήσομαι· ὁ λαός σου, λαός μου, καὶ ὁ Θεός
**17.** σου, Θεός μου· καὶ οὗ ἐὰν ἀποθάνῃς, ἀποθανοῦμαι, κἀκεῖ ταφή-
    σομαι· τάδε ποιήσαι Κύριός μοι, καὶ τάδε προσθείη, ὅτι θάνατος
**18.** διαστελεῖ ἀνάμεσον ἐμοῦ καὶ σοῦ. Ἰδοῦσα δὲ Νοεμμείν ὅτι κρα-
    ταιοῦται αὐτὴ τοῦ πορεύεσθαι μετ᾿ αὐτῆς, ἐκόπασε τοῦ λαλῆσαι
**19.** πρὸς αὐτὴν ἔτι. Ἐπορεύθησαν δὲ ἀμφότεραι, ἕως τοῦ παραγενέ-
    σθαι αὐτὰς εἰς Βαιθλεέμ. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἐλθεῖν αὐτὰς εἰς
    Βαιθλεέμ, καὶ ἤχησε πᾶσα ἡ πόλις ἐπ᾿ αὐταῖς, καὶ εἶπον· αὕτη
**20.** (τί) ἐστι Νοεμμείν; Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτάς· μὴ καλεῖτέ με Νο-
    εμμείν· καλέσατέ με πικράν, ὅτι ἐπικράνθη ἐν ἐμοὶ ὁ ἱκανὸς σφό-
**21.** δρα. Ἐγὼ πλήρης ἐπορεύθην, καὶ κενὴν ἀπέστρεψέ με ὁ Κύριος·
    καὶ ἵνατί καλεῖτέ με Νοεμμείν, καὶ Κύριος ἐταπείνωσέ με, καὶ
**22.** ὁ ἱκανὸς ἐκάκωσέ με; Καὶ ἐπέστρεψε Νοεμμεὶν καὶ Ῥοὺθ ἡ Μω-
    αβῖτις ἡ νύμφη αὐτῆς μετ᾿ αὐτῆς, ἐπιστρέφουσα ἐξ ἀγροῦ Μωάβ·
    αὗται δὲ παρεγενήθησαν εἰς Βηθλεὲμ ἐν ἀρχῇ θερισμοῦ κριθῶν.

**ΚΕΦ. Β'. II.**

**1.** ΚΑΙ τῇ Νοεμεὶν ἀνὴρ γνώριμος τῷ ἀνδρὶ αὐτῆς· ὁ δὲ ἀνὴρ
    δυνατὸς ἐν ἰσχύϊ, ἐκ τῆς συγγενείας Ἀλιμέλεχ, καὶ ὄνομα αὐ-
**2.** τῷ Βοόζ. Καὶ εἶπε Ῥοὺθ ἡ Μωαβῖτις πρὸς Νοεμμείν· πορευθῶ
    δὴ εἰς ἀγρόν, καὶ συνάξω ἐν τοῖς στάχυσι, κατόπισθεν οὗ ἐὰν
    εὕρω χάριν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτοῦ. Εἶπε δὲ αὐτῇ· πορεύου θύγα-

### The Book of Ruth

### Chapter 1

**12.** Turn again then, my daughters, for this cause: for I am too old to have an husband. For I said, that there is unto me a prospect that I might become a man's wife, and bear sons;
**13.** would ye wait for them till they were grown? or would ye be held back for them, from having husbands? Nay, my daughters; for my sorrow is exceedingly bitter for your sakes, because the hand of the Lord is gone forth against me.
**14.** And they lifted up their voice, and wept again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, and returned unto her people.
**15.** But Ruth clave unto her. And Naomi said unto Ruth, "Behold, thy sister-in-law is turned back unto her people and unto her gods: return thou also after thy sister-in-law."
**16.** And Ruth said, "Entreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God:
**17.** and where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the Lord do so to me, and more also, if aught but death part thee and me."
**18.** When Naomi saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her, then she left off speaking unto her.
**19.** So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, "Is this Naomi?"
**20.** And she said unto them, "Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.
**21.** I went out full, and the Lord hath brought me home again empty: why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the Lord hath humbled me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?"
**22.** So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, returning out of the country of Moab: and they came unto Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.

### Chapter 2

**1.** Now Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz.
**2.** And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, "Let me now go to the field, and glean among the ears [of corn] after him in whose sight I shall find favour." And she said unto her, "Go, my daughter."
**3.** And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light upon a parcel of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.
