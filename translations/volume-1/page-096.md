πρίασθαι βρώματα. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἡνίκα ἦλθομεν εἰς τὸ καταλῦσαι, 20
καὶ ἠνοίξαμεν τοὺς μαρσίππους ἡμῶν, καὶ τόδε τὸ ἀργύριον ἑκά-
στου ἐν τῷ μαρσίππῳ αὐτοῦ· τὸ ἀργύριον ἡμῶν ἐν σταθμῷ ἀπε-
στρέψαμεν νῦν ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν ἡμῶν· καὶ ἀργύριον ἕτερον ἠνέγκα- 21
μεν μεθ᾿ ἑαυτῶν, ἀγοράσαι βρώματα· οὐκ οἴδαμεν τίς ἐνέβαλε τὸ
ἀργύριον εἰς τοὺς μαρσίππους ἡμῶν. Εἶπε δὲ αὐτοῖς (ὁ ἄνθρω- 22
πος)· Ἵλεως ὑμῖν, μὴ φοβεῖσθε· ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν καὶ ὁ Θεὸς τῶν
πατέρων ὑμῶν ἔδωκεν ὑμῖν θησαυροὺς ἐν τοῖς μαρσίπποις ὑμῶν·
τὸ δὲ ἀργύριον ὑμῶν εὐδοκιμοῦν ἀπέχω. Καὶ ἐξήγαγε πρὸς αὐ-
τοὺς τὸν Συμεών. Καὶ ἤνεγκεν ὕδωρ νίψαι τοὺς πόδας αὐτῶν· καὶ 23
ἤνεγκε χορτάσματα τοῖς ὄνοις αὐτῶν. Ἡτοίμασαν δὲ τὰ δῶρα, 24
ἕως τοῦ ἐλθεῖν Ἰωσὴφ μεσημβρία· ἤκουσαν γὰρ ἔτι ἔχει μέλλει
ἀριστᾷν. Εἰσῆλθε δὲ Ἰωσὴφ εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν· καὶ προσήνεγκαν αὐτῷ 25
τὰ δῶρα, ἃ εἶχον ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτῶν, εἰς τὸν οἶκον, καὶ προσ-
εκύνησαν αὐτῷ ἐπὶ πρόσωπον ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν. Ἡρώτησε δὲ αὐτούς· 26
πῶς ἔχετε; Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· εἰ ὑγιαίνει ὁ πατὴρ ὑμῶν ὁ πρε-
σβύτερος, ὃν εἴπατε; ἔτι ζῇ; Οἱ δὲ εἶπαν· ὑγιαίνει ὁ παῖς σου 27
ὁ πατὴρ ἡμῶν, ἔτι ζῇ. Καὶ εἶπεν· εὐλογητὸς ὁ ἄνθρωπος ἐκεῖνος
τῷ Θεῷ. Καὶ κύψαντες προσεκύνησαν. Ἀναβλέψας δὲ τοῖς ὀφ- 28
θαλμοῖς αὐτοῦ Ἰωσὴφ, ἴδε Βενιαμὶν τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ τὸν ὁμομή-
τριον· καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ ἀδελφὸς ὑμῶν ὁ νεώτερος,
ὃν εἴπατε πρὸς με ἀγαγεῖν; Καὶ εἶπεν· ὁ Θεὸς ἐλεήσαι σε τέ-
κνον. Ἐταράχθη δὲ Ἰωσὴφ· συνεστρέφετο γὰρ τὰ ἔντερα αὐτοῦ 29
ἐπὶ τῷ ἀδελφῷ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐζήτει κλαῦσαι. Εἰσελθὼν δὲ εἰς τὸ τα- 30
μεῖον, ἔκλαυσεν ἐκεῖ. Καὶ νιψάμενος τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ, ἐξελ-
θὼν ἐνεκρατεύσατο, καὶ εἶπε· παράθετε ἄρτους. Καὶ παρέθηκαν αὐ- 31
τῷ μόνῳ, καὶ αὐτοῖς καθ᾿ ἑαυτοὺς, καὶ τοῖς Αἰγυπτίοις τοῖς συν-
δειπνοῦσι μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καθ᾿ ἑαυτούς· οὐ γὰρ ἐδύναντο οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι
συνεσθίειν μετὰ τῶν Ἑβραίων ἄρτους· βδέλυγμα γὰρ ἐστι τοῖς Αἰ-
γυπτίοις (πᾶς ποιμὴν προβάτων). Ἐκάθησαν δὲ ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ, ὁ 32
πρωτότοκος κατὰ τὰ πρεσβεῖα αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὁ νεώτερος κατὰ τὴν νεό-
τητα αὐτοῦ· ἐξίσταντο δὲ οἱ ἄνθρωποι ἕκαστος πρὸς τὸν ἀδελ-
φὸν αὐτοῦ. Ἦραν δὲ μερίδα παρ᾿ αὐτοῦ πρὸς αὐτούς· ἐμεγάλυν- 33
θη δὲ ἡ μερὶς Βενιαμὶν παρὰ τὰς μερίδας πάντων, πενταπλασίως
πρὸς τὰς ἐκείνων. Ἔπιον δὲ, καὶ ἐμεθύσθησαν μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ.

**Chapter 43**

20 to buy sustenance. And it came to pass, when we arrived to lodge, and opened our sacks, that behold, the silver of each man was in his sack; our silver, even the full weight thereof, did we return this day in our hands; 21 and other silver brought we with us, to buy sustenance. We know not who did put the silver into our sacks."

22 Then said he unto them (the man): "Peace be unto you, fear ye not; your God, even the God of your fathers, hath given you treasures in your sacks; and your silver, I have received it to my good pleasure." And he brought Simeon forth unto them.

23 And he brought water to wash their feet; and he brought fodder for their asses.

24 And they made ready their gifts until Joseph should come at midday; for they had heard: "He yet hath; he is about to dine."

25 And Joseph came into the house; and they brought him the gifts, which they had in their hands, into the house, and bowed themselves down before him with [their] faces to the earth.

26 And he asked them: "How fare ye?" And he said unto them: "Is your aged father well, of whom ye spake? Doth he yet live?"

27 And they answered: "Thy servant, our father, is well; he yet liveth." And he said: "Blessed be that man by God." And they bowed down and did obeisance.

28 And Joseph, lifting up his eyes, beheld Benjamin his brother, his mother's son; and he said unto them: "Is this your younger brother, of whom ye told me to bring unto me?" And he said: "May God have mercy upon thee, my son."

29 And Joseph was greatly troubled; for his bowels did yearn within him for his brother, and he sought to weep.

30 And he entered into [his] inner chamber, and wept there. And having washed his face, he went forth and restrained himself, and said: "Set on bread."

31 And they set [food] for him alone, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians who did eat with him, by themselves; for the Egyptians could not eat bread with the Hebrews; for it is an abomination unto the Egyptians (every shepherd of sheep).

32 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the younger according to his youth; and the men did marvel, each one at his brother.

33 And portions were brought from him unto them; but the portion of Benjamin was made greater than all the portions, five times as much as theirs. And they drank, and were drunken with him.
