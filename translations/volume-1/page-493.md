4 τῶν καθημένων, καὶ ἐναντίον τῶν πρεσβυτέρων τοῦ λαοῦ μου· εἴ
   ἀγχιστεύεις, ἀγχίστευε· εἰ δὲ μὴ ἀγχιστεύεις, ἀνάγγειλόν μοι, καὶ
   γνώσομαι ὅτι οὐκ ἔστι πάρεξ σοῦ τοῦ ἀγχιστεῦσαι, κἀγὼ εἰμὶ
   μετά σέ. Ὁ δὲ εἶπεν· ἐγώ εἰμι, ἀγχιστεύσω. Καὶ εἶπε Βοός· ἐν
5  ἡμέρᾳ τοῦ κτήσασθαί σε τὸν ἀγρὸν ἐκ χειρὸς Νοεμμεὶν καὶ παρὰ
   Ῥοὺθ τῆς Μωαβίτιδος γυναικὸς τοῦ τεθνηκότος, καὶ αὐτὴν κτήσασθαί
   σε δεῖ, ὥστε ἀναστῆσαί σε τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ τεθνηκότος ἐπὶ τῆς κληρονο-
6  μίας αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ ἀγχιστεὺς· οὐ δυνήσομαι ἀγχιστεῦσαι ἐμαυτῷ,
   μήποτε διαφθείρω τὴν κληρονομίαν μου· ἀγχίστευσον σεαυτῷ τὴν ἀγ-
   χιστείαν μου, ὅτι οὐ δυνήσομαι ἀγχιστεῦσαι.
7  Καὶ τοῦτο τὸ δικαίωμα ἔμπροσθεν ἐν τῷ Ἰσραὴλ ἐπὶ τὴν ἀγχιστείαν
   καὶ ἐπὶ τὸ ἀντάλλαγμα, τοῦ στῆσαι τὸν πάντα λόγον· καὶ ὑπελύετο
   ὁ ἀνὴρ τὸ ὑπόδημα αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐδίδου τῷ πλησίον αὐτοῦ τὴν ἀγχιστείαν
   αὐτοῦ·
8  καὶ τοῦτο ἦν μαρτύριον ἐν Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ ἀγχιστεὺς τῷ
   Βοός· κτῆσαι σεαυτῷ τὴν ἀγχιστείαν μου. Καὶ ὑπελύσατο τὸ ὑπό-
9  δημα αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ. Καὶ εἶπε Βοὸς τοῖς πρεσβυτέροις
   καὶ παντὶ τῷ λαῷ· μάρτυρες ὑμεῖς σήμερον, ὅτι κέκτημαι πάντα
   τὰ τοῦ Ἀλιμέλεχ, καὶ πάντα ὅσα ὑπάρχει τῷ Χαιλέων καὶ τῷ
10 Μααλὼν ἐκ χειρὸς Νοεμμεὶν· καὶ γε Ῥοὺθ τὴν Μωαβῖτιν τὴν γυ-
   ναῖκα Μααλὼν κέκτημαι ἐμαυτῷ εἰς γυναῖκα, τοῦ ἀναστῆσαι τὸ
   ὄνομα τοῦ τεθνηκότος ἐπὶ τῆς κληρονομίας αὐτοῦ. καὶ οὐκ ἐξολο-
   θρευθήσεται τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ τεθνηκότος ἐκ τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτοῦ, καὶ
   ἐκ τῆς φυλῆς τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ· μάρτυρες ὑμεῖς σήμερον.
11 Καὶ εἶπαν πᾶς ὁ λαός, οἱ ἐν τῇ πύλῃ· μάρτυρες. Καὶ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι
   εἴποσαν· ἐῴη Κύριος τὴν γυναίκά σου τὴν εἰσπορευομένην εἰς τὸν
   οἶκόν σου ὡς Ῥαχὴλ καὶ ὡς Λείαν, αἳ ᾠκοδόμησαν ἀμφότεραι τὸν
   οἶκον Ἰσραήλ· καὶ ποιῆσαι δύναμιν ἐν Ἐφραθᾷ, καὶ ἔσται ὄνομα ἐν
12 Βηθλεέμ· καὶ γένοιτο ὁ οἶκός σου ὡς ὁ οἶκος Φαρὲς, ὃν ἔτεκε
   Θάμαρ τῷ Ἰούδα, ἐκ τοῦ σπέρματος οὗ δώσει Κύριός σοι ἐκ τῆς
13 παιδίσκης ταύτης. Καὶ ἔλαβε Βοὸς τὴν Ῥοὺθ, καὶ ἐγένετο αὐτῷ
   εἰς γυναῖκα, καὶ εἰσῆλθε πρὸς αὐτήν· καὶ ἔδωκε Κύριος κύη-
14 σιν αὐτῇ, καὶ ἐγέννησεν υἱόν. Καὶ εἶπαν αἱ γυναῖκες πρὸς Νοεμ-
   μεὶν· εὐλογητὸς Κύριος, ὃς οὐ κατέλυσε σοι σήμερον τὸν ἀγχιστέα·
15 καὶ καλέσαι τὸ ὄνομά σου ἐν Ἰσραήλ· καὶ ἔσται σοι εἰς ἐπιστρέ-
   φοντα ψυχήν, καὶ τοῦ διαθρέψαι τὴν πολιάν σου, ὅτι ἡ νύμφη σου
   ἡ ἀγαπήσασά σε, ἔτεκεν αὐτόν, ἡ ἐστιν ἀγαθή σοι ὑπερ ἑπτὰ υἱούς.

### Chapter 4

**4.** ...of those who sit [here], and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem, redeem [it]; but if thou wilt not redeem, make it known unto me, that I may know there is none to redeem save thee, and I am next after thee.'" And he said, "I will redeem."
**5.** Then said Boaz, "In the day that thou acquirest the field from the hand of Naomi, and from Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of him that is deceased, it is needful for thee to acquire her also, that thou mayest raise up the name of the deceased upon his inheritance."
**6.** And the kinsman redeemer said, "I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I destroy mine own inheritance; redeem thou my right of redemption for thyself, for I cannot redeem it."
**7.** Now this was the custom in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, to establish every matter: that a man would loose his sandal and give it to his neighbor for his right of redemption.
**8.** And this was a witness in Israel. And the kinsman redeemer said unto Boaz, "Acquire thou my right of redemption for thyself." And he loosed his sandal, and gave it to him.
**9.** And Boaz said unto the elders and unto all the people, "Ye are witnesses this day, that I have acquired all that was Elimelech's, and all that belonged unto Chilion and unto Mahlon, from the hand of Naomi;
**10.** and indeed, Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I acquired for myself as a wife, to raise up the name of the deceased upon his inheritance, that the name of the deceased may not be utterly destroyed from among his brethren, and from the tribe of his people. Ye are witnesses this day."
**11.** And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, "Witnesses! May the Lord grant that thy wife, who comes into thy house, be as Rachel and as Leah, which two did build the house of Israel; and mayest thou do valiantly in Ephrathah, and may thy name be renowned in Bethlehem.
**12.** And may thy house be as the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore unto Judah, from the offspring which the Lord shall give thee of this young woman."
**13.** So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife; and he went in unto her. And the Lord gave her conception, and she bore a son.
**14.** And the women said unto Naomi, "Blessed be the Lord, who hath not left thee this day without a kinsman redeemer;
**15.** and [may] his name be proclaimed in Israel. And he shall be unto thee a restorer of life, and one to nourish thine old age; for thy daughter-in-law, who loves thee, hath borne him, who is better to thee than seven sons."
