842 ΔΕΥΤΕΡΟΝΟΜΙΟΝ ΚΕΦ. ΙΖʹ. ΙΗʹ.
Θανεῖται δ’ ἄνθρωπος ἐκεῖνος, καὶ ἐξαρεῖς τὸν πονηρὸν ἐξ Ἰσραήλ.
13 καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ἀκούσας φοβηθήσεται, καὶ οὐκ ἀσεβήσει ἔτι.
14 Ἐὰν δὲ εἰσέλθῃς εἰς τὴν γῆν, ἣν Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου δίδωσί σοι
    ἐν κλήρῳ, καὶ κληρονομήσῃς αὐτῆς, καὶ κατοικήσῃς ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς,
    καὶ εἴπῃς· καταστήσω ἐπ᾿ ἐμαυτὸν ἄρχοντα, καθὰ καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ
15 ἔθνη τὰ κύκλῳ μου, καθιστῶν καθιστήσεις ἐπὶ σεαυτὸν ἄρχοντα,
    ὃν ἂν ἐκλέξηται Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου αὐτόν· ἐκ τῶν ἀδελφῶν σου
    καταστήσεις ἐπὶ σεαυτὸν ἄρχοντα, οὐ δυνήσῃ καταστῆσαι ἐπὶ σεαυ-
16 τὸν ἄνθρωπον ἀλλότριον, ὅτι οὐκ ἀδελφός σου ἐστί. Πλὴν οὐ πλη-
    θυνεῖ ἑαυτῷ ἵππον, οὐδὲ μὴ ἀποστρέψει τὸν λαὸν εἰς Αἴγυπτον,
    ὅπως (μὴ) πληθύνῃ ἑαυτῷ ἵππον. Ὁ δὲ Κύριος εἶπεν ὑμῖν· οὐ
17 προσθήσεσθε ἀποστρέψαι τῇ ὁδῷ ταύτῃ ἔτι. Καὶ οὐ πληθυνεῖ ἑαυτῷ
    γυναῖκας, ἵνα μὴ μεταστῇ αὐτοῦ ἡ καρδία· καὶ ἀργύριον καὶ χρυ-
18 σίον οὐ πληθυνεῖ ἑαυτῷ σφόδρα. Καὶ ἔσται ὅταν καθίσῃ ἐπὶ τοῦ
    θρόνου τῆς ἀρχῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ γράψει ἑαυτῷ τὸ Δευτερονόμιον τοῦ-
    το εἰς βιβλίον παρὰ τῶν ἱερέων τῶν Λευιτῶν, καὶ ἔσται μετ᾿ αὐ-
    τοῦ, καὶ ἀναγνώσεται ἐν αὐτῷ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς ζωῆς αὐ-
    τοῦ, ἵνα μάθῃ φοβεῖσθαι Κύριον τὸν Θεὸν αὐτοῦ, φυλάσσεσθαι πά-
    σας τὰς ἐντολὰς ταύτας καὶ τὰ δικαιώματα ταῦτα, ποιεῖν αὐτά·
20 ἵνα μὴ ὑψωθῇ ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτοῦ, ἵνα μὴ παραβῇ
    ἀπὸ τῶν ἐντολῶν δεξιὰ ἢ ἀριστερά, ὅπως ἂν μακροχρόνιος ᾖ ἐπὶ τῆς
    ἀρχῆς αὐτοῦ, αὐτὸς καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, ἐν τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ.

1 ΟΥΚ ἔσται τοῖς ἱερεῦσι τοῖς Λευίταις ὅλη φυλὴ Λευὶ μερὶς
2 οὐδὲ κλῆρος μετὰ Ἰσραήλ· κάρπωμα Κυρίου ὁ κλῆρος αὐτῶν, φά-
    γονται αὐτά. Κλῆρος δὲ οὐκ ἔσται αὐτῷ ἐν τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς αὐτοῦ·
3 Κύριος αὐτὸς κλῆρος αὐτοῦ, καθότι εἶπεν αὐτῷ. Καὶ αὕτη ἔσται
    ἡ κρίσις τῶν ἱερέων, τὰ παρὰ τοῦ λαοῦ παρὰ τῶν θυόντων τὰς
    θυσίας, ἐάν τε μόσχον, ἐάν τε πρόβατον· καὶ δώσει τῷ ἱερεῖ τὸν

    σίτου σου, καὶ τοῦ οἴνου σου, καὶ τοῦ ἐλαίου σου, καὶ τὴν ἀπαρ-

**DEUTERONOMY CHAPTER XVII**

12 That man shall surely die, and thou shalt purge the evil from Israel.
13 And all the people shall hear, and shall be afraid, and shall no more commit transgression.

14 When thou art come unto the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and thou shalt inherit it, and dwell therein, and shalt say, "I will set a king over me, even as all the nations that are round about me";
15 thou shalt surely set over thee a king whom the Lord thy God shall choose. From among thy brethren shalt thou set a king over thee; thou shalt not be able to set over thee a stranger,
16 because he is not thy brother. But he shall not multiply horses unto himself, neither shall he cause the people to return to Egypt, lest he multiply [horses] for himself. For the Lord hath said unto you, "Ye shall not return again by this way."
17 Neither shall he multiply wives unto himself, that his heart turn not away; nor shall he exceedingly multiply silver and gold unto himself.
18 And it shall be when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write for himself this Deuteronomy in a book, from the priests, the Levites; and it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life,
19 that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, to keep all these commandments and these statutes, to do them;
20 that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not aside from the commandments to the right hand or to the left, so that he may be long-lived in his dominion, he and his sons with him, among the children of Israel.

**CHAPTER XVIII**

1 The priests, the Levites, all the tribe of Levi, shall have no portion nor inheritance with Israel. The offerings of the Lord are their inheritance;
2 they shall eat them. For he shall have no inheritance among his brethren; the Lord Himself is his inheritance, as He said unto him.
3 And this shall be the priests' due from the people, from them that offer sacrifices, whether it be ox or sheep: they shall give unto the priest the shoulder, and the cheeks, and the maw.
4 And the firstfruits of thy corn, and of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the first shearings of thy sheep, shalt thou give him.
5 For the Lord thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes, to stand before the Lord thy God, to minister and to bless in the name of the Lord,
