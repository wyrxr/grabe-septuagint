338 ΔΕΥΤΕΡΟΝΟΜΙΟΝ ΚΕΦ. ΙΕʹ.
6 πάσας τὰς ἐντολὰς ταύτας, ἃς ἐγὼ ἐντέλλομαί σοι σήμερον, ὅτι Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου εὐλόγησέ σε, ὃν τρόπον ἐλάλησέ σοι, καὶ δανειεῖς ἔθνεσι πολλοῖς, σὺ δὲ οὐ δανειῇ· καὶ σὺ ἄρξη πολλῶν ἐθνῶν, σοῦ δὲ οὐκ
7 ἄρξουσιν. Ἐὰν δὲ γένηταί σοι ἐνδεὴς ἐκ τῶν ἀδελφῶν σου ἐν μιᾷ τῶν πόλεών σου ἐν τῇ γῇ, ᾗ Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου δίδωσί σοι (ἐν κλήρῳ), οὐκ ἀποστέρξεις τὴν καρδίαν σου, οὐδὲ μὴ συσφίγξεις τὴν χεῖρά σου ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου τοῦ ἐπιδεομένου·
8 ὅτι ἀνοίγων ἀνοίξεις τὰς χεῖράς σου αὐτῷ, καὶ δάνειον δανειεῖς αὐτῷ ἱκανόν, ὅσον ἂν ἐπιδέηται, (καὶ) καθ᾿ ὅσον ὑστερεῖται.
9 Πρόσεχε σεαυτῷ μὴ ποτε γένηται ῥῆμα κρυπτὸν ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ σου ἀνόμημα, λέγων· ἐγγίζει τὸ ἔτος τὸ ἕβδομον, ἔτος ἀφέσεως, καὶ πονηρεύσηται ὁ ὀφθαλμός σου τῷ ἀδελφῷ σου τῷ ἐπιδεομένῳ, καὶ οὐ δώσεις αὐτῷ, καὶ βοήσεται κατὰ σοῦ πρὸς Κύριον, καὶ ἔσται ἐν σοὶ ἁμαρτία μεγάλη.
10 διδὼς δώσεις αὐτῷ, καὶ δάνειον δανειεῖς αὐτῷ, ὅσον ἂν ἐπιδέηταί σου, καὶ οὐ λυπήσῃ τῇ καρδίᾳ σου διδόντος σου αὐτῷ, ὅτι διὰ τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο εὐλογήσει σε Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς ἔργοις σου, καὶ ἐν πᾶσιν οἷς ἂν ἐπιβάλῃς τὴν χεῖρά σου·
11 Οὐ γὰρ μὴ ἐκλίπῃ ἐνδεὴς ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς (σου)· διὰ τοῦτο ἐγώ σοι ἐντέλλομαι ποιεῖν τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο, λέγων· ἀνοίγων ἀνοίξεις τὰς χεῖράς σου τῷ ἀδελφῷ σου τῷ πένητί σου καὶ τῷ δεομένῳ τῷ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς σου.
12 Ἐὰν δὲ πραθῇ σοι ὁ ἀδελφός σου ὁ Ἑβραῖος ἢ ἡ Ἑβραία, δουλεύσει σοι ἓξ ἔτη, καὶ τῷ ἔτει τῷ ἑβδόμῳ ἐξαποστελεῖς αὐτὸν ἐλεύθερον ἀπὸ σοῦ.
13 Ὅταν δὲ ἐξαποστείλῃς αὐτὸν ἐλεύθερον ἀπὸ σοῦ,
14 οὐκ ἐξαποστελεῖς αὐτὸν κενόν· ἐφόδιον ἐφοδιάσεις αὐτὸν ἀπὸ τῶν προβάτων σου, καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ σίτου σου, καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς ληνοῦ σου· καθὰ ηὐλόγησέ σε Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου, δώσεις αὐτῷ.
15 Καὶ μνησθήσῃ ὅτι οἰκέτης ἦσθα ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ, καὶ ἐλυτρώσατό σε Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου ἐκεῖθεν· διὰ τοῦτο ἐγώ σοι ἐντέλλομαι ποιεῖν τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο σήμερον.
16 Ἐὰν δὲ λέγῃ πρὸς σέ· οὐκ ἐξελεύσομαι ἀπὸ σοῦ, ὅτι ἠγάπησέ σε καὶ τὴν οἰκίαν σου, ὅτι εὖ ἔστιν αὐτῷ παρὰ σοί·
17 λήψῃ τὸ ὀπήτιον, καὶ τρυπήσεις τὸ οὖς αὐτοῦ πρὸς τὴν θύραν (ἐπὶ τὸν σταθμόν), καὶ ἔσται οἰκέτης σου εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα· καὶ τὴν παιδίσκην σου ποιήσεις ὡσαύτως.
18 Οὐ σκληρὸν ἔσται ἐναντίον σου ἐξαποστελλομένων αὐτῶν ἐλευθέρων ἀπὸ σοῦ, ὅτι ἐπέτειον μισθὸν τοῦ μισθωτοῦ ἐδούλευσέ σοι ἓξ ἔτη· καὶ
19 εὐλογήσει σε Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου ἐν πᾶσιν οἷς ἐὰν ποιῇς. Πᾶ

**English Translation:**

**DEUTERONOMY CHAPTER 15**

**6** all these commandments which I command thee this day, because the Lord thy God hath blessed thee, as He spake unto thee; and thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt rule over many nations, but they shall not rule over thee.
**7** And if there be amongst you a needy man, one of thy brethren, within one of thy cities in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee (as an inheritance), thou shalt not harden thine heart, nor close thine hand from thy brother who is in need;
**8** for thou shalt surely open thy hand unto him, and shalt lend him a sufficient loan, as much as he shall have need of, (and) as much as he doth lack.
**9** Take heed to thyself, lest there be a secret word in thine heart, a lawless thing, saying: The seventh year draweth nigh, the year of release; and thine eye be evil toward thy brother who is in need, and thou givest him not, and he crieth out against thee unto the Lord, and it shall be a great sin within thee.
**10** Thou shalt surely give to him, and shalt lend him a loan, as much as he hath need of thee; and thy heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him, for because of this word the Lord thy God shall bless thee in all thy works, and in all that thou layest thine hand upon.
**11** For the needy shall not cease out of the land (of thine); therefore I command thee to do this word, saying: Thou shalt surely open thy hands unto thy brother, even to thy poor, and to him who is in need upon thy land.
**12** And if thy brother, a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman, be sold unto thee, he shall serve thee six years; and in the seventh year thou shalt send him forth free from thee.
**13** And when thou sendest him forth free from thee,
**14** thou shalt not send him forth empty; thou shalt surely furnish him from thy sheep, and from thy grain, and from thy winepress; as the Lord thy God hath blessed thee, so shalt thou give unto him.
**15** And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondservant in the land of Egypt, and the Lord thy God redeemed thee thence; therefore I command thee to do this word this day.
**16** But if he say unto thee: I will not go out from thee, because he loveth thee and thy house, because it is well with him by thee;
**17** then thou shalt take the awl, and shalt pierce his ear unto the door (upon the doorpost), and he shall be thy bondservant forever; and unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise.
**18** It shall not seem hard unto thee when thou sendest them forth free from thee, for he hath served thee six years [for] the annual wage of a hired servant; and
**19** the Lord thy God shall bless thee in all that thou doest. All
