αὐτοῦ, καὶ προσκεῖσθαι αὐτῷ, καὶ λατρεύειν αὐτῷ ἐξ ὅλης τῆς
καρδίας ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐξ ὅλης τῆς ψυχῆς ὑμῶν. Καὶ εὐλό- 6
γησεν αὐτοὺς Ἰησοῦς, καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν αὐτούς· καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν
εἰς τοὺς οἴκους αὐτῶν. (Καὶ τοῖς ἡμίσεσι φυλῆς Μανασσῆ ἔδωκε 7
Μωυσῆς ἐν τῇ Βασάν, καὶ τοῖς ἡμίσεσιν ἔδωκεν Ἰησοῦς μετὰ
τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτῶν ἐν τῷ πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου, παρὰ θάλασσαν.)
Καὶ ἡνίκα ἐξαπέστειλεν αὐτοὺς Ἰησοῦς εἰς τοὺς οἴκους αὐτῶν, καὶ
εὐλόγησεν αὐτούς· καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτοὺς, λέγων· ἐν χρήμασι πολ- 8
λοῖς ἀπῆλθοσαν εἰς τοὺς οἴκους αὐτῶν, καὶ κτήνη πολλὰ σφόδρα,
καὶ ἀργύριον καὶ χρυσίον, καὶ χαλκόν, καὶ σίδηρον, καὶ ἱματι-
σμὸν πολὺν σφόδρα· διεῖλαντο τὴν προνομήν τῶν ἐχθρῶν αὐτῶν
μετὰ τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἀπέστρεψαν, καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν οἱ 9
υἱοὶ Ῥουβὴν καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Γὰδ καὶ τὸ ἥμισυ φυλῆς Μανασσῆ ἀπὸ
τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ ἐκ Σηλὼ ἐν γῇ Χαναάν, ἀπελθεῖν εἰς γῆν Γα-
λαάδ, εἰς γῆν κατασχέσεως αὐτῶν, ἣν ἐκληρονόμησαν αὐτῇ διὰ
προστάγματος Κυρίου ἐν χειρὶ Μωυσῆ. Καὶ ἦλθοσαν εἰς Γαλι- 10
λὼθ τοῦ Ἰορδάνου, ἥ ἐστιν ἐν γῇ Χαναὰν καὶ ᾠκοδόμησαν οἱ
υἱοὶ Ῥουβὴν καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Γὰδ καὶ τὸ ἥμισυ φυλῆς Μανασσῆ ἐκεῖ
βωμὸν ἐπὶ τοῦ Ἰορδάνου, βωμὸν μέγαν τοῦ ἰδεῖν. Καὶ ἤκουσαν 11
οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ λεγόντων· Ἰδοὺ ᾠκοδόμησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ῥουβὴν καὶ οἱ
υἱοὶ Γὰδ καὶ τὸ ἥμισυ φυλῆς Μανασσῆ βωμὸν ἐφ᾽ ὁρίων γῆς Χα-
ναάν, ἐπὶ τοῦ Γαλιλὼθ τοῦ Ἰορδάνου ἐν τῷ πέραν υἱῶν Ἰσ-
ραήλ. Καὶ ἤκουσαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ συνηθροίσθησαν πάντες 12
οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ εἰς Σηλώ, ὥστε ἀναβῆναι ἐκπολεμῆσαι αὐτούς.
Καὶ ἀπέστειλαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς τοὺς υἱοὺς Ῥουβὴν καὶ πρὸς 13
τοὺς υἱοὺς Γὰδ καὶ πρὸς τὸ ἥμισυ φυλῆς Μανασσῆ εἰς γῆν Γα-
λαὰδ τόν τε Φινεὲς υἱὸν Ἐλεάζαρ υἱὸν Ἀαρὼν τοῦ ἀρχιερέως,
καὶ δέκα τῶν ἀρχόντων μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ, ἄρχων εἷς ἀπὸ οἴκου πα- 14
τριᾶς ἀπὸ πασῶν τῶν φυλῶν Ἰσραήλ· ἄνδρες ἄρχοντες οἴκων πα-
τριῶν εἰσι χιλίαρχοι Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ παρεγένοντο πρὸς τοὺς υἱοὺς 15
Ῥουβὴν καὶ πρὸς τοὺς υἱοὺς Γὰδ καὶ πρὸς τοὺς ἡμίσεις φυλῆς
Μανασσῆ εἰς γῆν Γαλαάδ, καὶ ἐλάλησαν πρὸς αὐτοὺς, λέγοντες·
τάδε λέγει πᾶσα ἡ συναγωγὴ Κυρίου· τίς ἡ πλημμέλεια αὕτη, 16
ἣν ἐπλημμελήσατε ἔναντι (Κυρίου) τοῦ Θεοῦ Ἰσραήλ, ἀποστρα-
φῆναι σήμερον ἀπὸ ὄπισθεν Κυρίου, οἰκοδομήσαντες ἑαυτοῖς βω-
μόν, ἀποστάτας ὑμᾶς γενέσθαι σήμερον ἀπὸ Κυρίου; Μὴ μικρὸν 17

**Joshua 22**
<sup>5</sup> and to cleave unto Him, and to serve Him with all your heart, and with all your soul.
<sup>6</sup> And Joshua blessed them, and sent them away; and they departed unto their homes.
<sup>7</sup> (Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given [an inheritance] in Bashan; but to the other half Joshua gave [an inheritance] with their brethren beyond the Jordan, by the sea.)
<sup>8</sup> And when Joshua had sent them away unto their homes, and blessed them, he spake unto them, saying: "With much wealth are ye gone unto your homes, and with very many cattle, and silver, and gold, and bronze, and iron, and very many garments. Divide ye the spoil of your enemies with your brethren."
<sup>9</sup> And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go unto the land of Gilead, unto the land of their possession, which they had inherited therein by the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses.
<sup>10</sup> And they came unto Geliloth of Jordan, which is in the land of Canaan, and the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar to be seen.
<sup>11</sup> And the children of Israel heard men say, "Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar upon the borders of the land of Canaan, upon Geliloth of Jordan, on the side of Jordan pertaining to the children of Israel."
<sup>12</sup> And when the children of Israel heard [thereof], all the children of Israel assembled themselves together at Shiloh, to go up to make war against them.
<sup>13</sup> And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the high priest,
<sup>14</sup> and ten princes with him, one prince from each house of the fathers from all the tribes of Israel; which men were princes of the houses of the fathers, [even] captains of thousands of Israel.
<sup>15</sup> And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, and they spake unto them, saying:
<sup>16</sup> "Thus saith all the congregation of the Lord: 'What trespass is this which ye have committed before [the Lord] God of Israel, to turn away this day from following the Lord, in that ye have built you an altar, that ye should be rebels this day against the Lord?
<sup>17</sup> Is the iniquity of Peor too small for us, from which we have not been cleansed until this day? For there was a plague in the congregation of the Lord.
