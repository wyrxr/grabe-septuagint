ἐπέθηκαν ἐπὶ τὰ δύο νῶτα αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν ὀπισθο-
φανῶς, καὶ συνεκάλυψαν τὴν γύμνωσιν τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῶν τῷ
προσώπῳ αὐτῶν ὀπισθοφανῶς, καὶ τὴν γύμνωσιν τοῦ πατρὸς αὐ-
τῶν οὐκ εἶδον. Ἐξένηψε δὲ Νῶε ἀπὸ τοῦ οἴνου, καὶ ἔγνω ὅσα 24
ἐποίησεν αὐτῷ ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ὁ νεώτερος. Καὶ εἶπεν· ἐπικατάρα- 25
τος Χαναάν· παῖς οἰκέτης ἔσται τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπεν 26
εὐλογητὸς Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ Σήμ, καὶ ἔσται Χαναὰν παῖς αὐ-
τοῦ. Πλατύναι ὁ Θεὸς τῷ Ἰάφεθ, καὶ κατοικησάτω ἐν τοῖς οἴ- 27
κοις τοῦ Σήμ, καὶ γενηθήτω Χαναὰν παῖς αὐτῶν. Ἔζησε δὲ Νῶε 28
μετὰ τὸν κατακλυσμὸν τριακόσια πεντήκοντα ἔτη· καὶ ἐγένοντο 29
πᾶσαι αἱ ἡμέραι Νῶε ἐννακόσια πεντήκοντα ἔτη, καὶ ἀπέθανεν.

ΑΥΤΑΙ δὲ αἱ γενέσεις τῶν υἱῶν Νῶε, Σήμ, Χάμ, Ἰάφεθ· καὶ 1
ἐγενήθησαν αὐτοῖς υἱοὶ μετὰ τὸν κατακλυσμόν. Υἱοὶ Ἰάφεθ· Γα- 2

αὐτῶν, ἕκαστος κατὰ γλῶσσαν, ἐν ταῖς φυλαῖς αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐν
τοῖς ἔθνεσιν αὐτῶν. Υἱοὶ δὲ Χάμ· Χοῦς, καὶ Μεσαῒν, Φούδ, καὶ 6
Χαναάν. Υἱοὶ δὲ Χοῦς· Σαβὰ καὶ Εὐιλᾶ, καὶ Σαβαθά, καὶ Ῥεγχ- 7
μᾶ, καὶ Σαβαθακά. Υἱοὶ δὲ Ῥεγχμᾶ· Σαβὰ, καὶ Δαδάν. Χοῦς δὲ 8
ἐγέννησε τὸν Νεβρὼδ· οὗτος ἤρξατο εἶναι γίγας ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς· οὗ- 9
τος ἦν γίγας κυνηγὸς ἐναντίον Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ. Διὰ τοῦτο ἐ-
ροῦσιν· ὡς Νεβρὼδ γίγας κυνηγὸς ἐναντίον Κυρίου. Καὶ ἐγένετο 10
ἀρχὴ τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ Βαβυλὼν, καὶ Ὀρέχ, καὶ Ἀργάδ, καὶ
Χαλάννη, ἐν τῇ γῇ Σενναάρ. Ἐκ τῆς γῆς ἐκείνης ἐξῆλθεν Ἀσ- 11

Χαλάχ, καὶ τὴν Δασὲμ ἀνὰ μέσον Νινευὴ καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον Χα-

25 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.
26 And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.

28 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
29 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.

**Chapter 10**

1 Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.
2 The sons of Japheth [were] Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Elisa, and Thobel, and Mosoch, and Thiras.
3 And the sons of Gomer [were] Aschanaz, and Riphath, and Thorgama.
4 And the sons of Javan [were] Elisa, and Tharsis, the Kittians, [and] the Rhodians.
5 From these were the islands of the nations separated in their land, each according to his tongue, in their tribes, and in their nations.
6 And the sons of Ham [were] Chous, and Mesain, Phoud, and Canaan.
7 And the sons of Chous [were] Saba and Euila, and Sabatha, and Rechma, and Sabathaka. And the sons of Rechma [were] Saba, and Dadán.
8 And Chous begat Nebrod; he began to be a giant upon the earth;
9 he was a giant hunter before the Lord God. Therefore shall they say, As Nebrod the giant hunter before the Lord.
10 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babylon, and Orech, and Argad, and Chalanne, in the land of Sennaar.
11 From that land went forth Assour; and he built Nineveh, and the city of Rooboth, and 12 Chalach, and Dasem, betwixt Nineveh and betwixt Chalach: this is the great city.
13 And Mesain begat the Ludiim, and the Nerthaliim, and the Ainemetiim, and the Ladiim,
14 and the Patrosoniim, and the Chasmoniim, whence came forth from thence the Phylistiim, and the Chabdooriim.
15 And Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn, and the Chettite, and the Jebusite,
