252 ΑΡΙΘΜΟΙ ΚΕΦ. Ι΄.
3 σοι ἀνακαλεῖν τὴν συναγωγήν, καὶ ἐξαίρειν τὰς παρεμβολάς. Καὶ σάλπιξις ἐν αὐταῖς, καὶ συναχθήσεται πρὸς σὲ πᾶσα ἡ συναγω-
4 γὴ ἐπὶ τὴν θύραν τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου. Ἐὰν δὲ ἐν μιᾷ σαλ-
5 πίσωσι, προσελεύσονται πρὸς σὲ πάντες οἱ ἄρχοντες ἀρχηγοὶ Ἰσραήλ.
6 Καὶ σαλπίειτε σημασίαν, καὶ ἐξαροῦσιν αἱ παρεμβολαὶ αἱ παρεμβάλλουσαι ἀνατολάς· καὶ σαλπίειτε σημασίαν δευτέραν, καὶ ἐξαροῦσιν αἱ παρεμβολαὶ αἱ παρεμβάλλουσαι νότον· καὶ σαλπίειτε σημασίαν τρίτην, καὶ ἐξαροῦσιν αἱ παρεμβολαὶ αἱ παρεμβάλλουσαι θάλασσαν· καὶ σαλπίειτε σημασίαν τετάρτην, καὶ ἐξαροῦσιν αἱ παρεμβολαὶ αἱ παρεμβάλλουσαι βορρᾶν· σημασία σαλπιοῦσιν
7 ἐν τῇ ἐξάρσει αὐτῶν. Καὶ ὅταν συναγάγητε τὴν συναγωγήν, σαλ-
8 πίετε, καὶ οὐ σημασία. Καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Ἀαρὼν οἱ ἱερεῖς σαλπιοῦσιν ἐν ταῖς σάλπιγξι· καὶ ἔσται ὑμῖν νόμιμον εἰς τὰς γενεὰς ὑμῶν.
9 Ἐὰν δὲ ἐξέλθητε εἰς πόλεμον ἐν τῇ γῇ ὑμῶν πρὸς τοὺς ὑπεναντίους τοὺς ἀνθεστηκότας ὑμῖν, καὶ σημανεῖτε ταῖς σάλπιγξι, καὶ ἀναμνησθήσεσθε ἔναντι Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ὑμῶν, καὶ διασωθήσεσθε
10 ἀπὸ τῶν ἐχθρῶν ὑμῶν. Καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις τῆς εὐφροσύνης ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἑορταῖς ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐν ταῖς νουμηνίαις ὑμῶν, σαλπίειτε ταῖς σάλπιγξιν ἐπὶ τοῖς ὁλοκαυτώμασι, καὶ ἐπὶ ταῖς θυσίαις τῶν σωτηρίων ὑμῶν· καὶ ἔσται ὑμῖν ἀνάμνησις ἔναντι τοῦ
11 Θεοῦ ὑμῶν· ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἐνιαυτῷ τῷ δευτέρῳ, ἐν τῷ μηνὶ τῷ δευτέρῳ εἰκάδι τοῦ μηνός,
12 ἀνέβη ἡ νεφέλη ἀπὸ τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου· καὶ ἐξῆραν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ σὺν ἀπαρτίαις αὐτῶν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ τοῦ Σινᾶ, καὶ
13 ἔστη ἡ νεφέλη ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ τοῦ Φαράν. Καὶ ἐξῆραν πρῶτοι διὰ
14 φωνῆς Κυρίου ἐν χειρὶ Μωυσῆ· καὶ ἐξῆραν τάγμα παρεμβολῆς τῶν υἱῶν Ἰούδα πρῶτοι σὺν δυνάμει αὐτῶν· καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς δυνά-
15 μεως αὐτῶν, Ναασὼν υἱὸς Ἀμιναδάβ· καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς δυνάμεως φυ-
16 λῆς υἱῶν Ἰσσάχαρ, Ναθαναὴλ υἱὸς Σωγάρ· καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς δυνάμεως
17 φυλῆς υἱῶν Ζαβουλών, Ἐλιὰβ υἱὸς Χαιλών. Καὶ καθελοῦσι τὴν σκηνήν, καὶ ἐξαροῦσιν οἱ υἱοὶ Γεδσών, καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Μεραρί, αἴρον-
18 τες τὴν σκηνήν. Καὶ ἐξῆραν τάγμα παρεμβολῆς Ῥουβὴν σὺν δυνάμει αὐτῶν· καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς δυνάμεως αὐτῶν, Ἐλισοὺρ υἱὸς Σε-
19 διούρ· καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς δυνάμεως φυλῆς υἱῶν Συμεών, Σαλαμιὴλ υἱὸς
20 Σουρισαδαΐ· καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς δυνάμεως φυλῆς υἱῶν Γάδ, Ἐλισὰφ ὁ τοῦ Ῥαγουήλ.
21 Καὶ ἐξαροῦσιν οἱ υἱοὶ Καάθ, αἴροντες τὰ ἅγια·

**NUMBERS CHAPTER 10**

3
    unto thee, to call the assembly,
    and to cause the camps to set forward.
    And [when] a trumpet blast [is sounded] among them,
    then shall all the assembly be gathered unto thee
    at the door of the Tabernacle of Testimony.

4
    And if they shall blow with but one trumpet,
    then shall all the princes, the heads of Israel,
    draw near unto thee.

5
    And ye shall blow an alarm;
    and the camps that lie encamped toward the east
    shall journey forth.

6
    And ye shall blow a second alarm;
    and the camps that lie encamped toward the south
    shall journey forth.
    And ye shall blow a third alarm;
    and the camps that lie encamped toward the sea [west]
    shall journey forth.
    And ye shall blow a fourth alarm;
    and the camps that lie encamped toward the north
    shall journey forth;
    an alarm shall they sound at their setting forth.

7
    But when ye gather the assembly together,
    ye shall blow, yet shall ye not sound an alarm.

8
    And the sons of Aaron, the priests,
    shall blow with the trumpets;
    and it shall be unto you an ordinance
    throughout your generations.

9
    And if ye go forth to war in your land
    against your adversaries,
    those that resist you,
    then shall ye sound an alarm with the trumpets;
    and ye shall be remembered before the Lord your God,
    and ye shall be saved from your enemies.

10
    And in the days of your gladness,
    and in your feasts,
    and in your New Moons,
    ye shall blow with the trumpets
    over your whole burnt offerings
    and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings;
    and they shall be a memorial for you
    before your God:
    I am the Lord your God.

11
    And it came to pass in the second year,
    in the second month,
    on the twentieth day of the month,

12
    that the cloud was taken up
    from over the Tabernacle of Testimony.
    And the sons of Israel journeyed forth
    according to their divisions
    from the wilderness of Sinai,

13
    and the cloud abode in the wilderness of Paran.

14
    And they journeyed first
    according to the voice of the Lord
    by the hand of Moses.
    And the division of the camp of the sons of Judah
    journeyed forth first with their host;

15
    and over their host was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.

16
    And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Issachar,
    Nethaneel the son of Zuar.

17
    And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Zebulun,
    Eliab the son of Helon.
    And they shall take down the Tabernacle,
    and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari,
    bearing the Tabernacle, shall set forth.

18
    And the division of the camp of Reuben
    set forth with their host;

19
    and over their host was Elizur the son of Shedeur.
    And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Simeon,
    Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.

20
    And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Gad,
    Eliasaph the son of Reuel.

21
    And the sons of Kohath shall set forth,
    bearing the holy things.
