**ΚΕΦ. Αʹ. ΔΕΥΤΕΡΟΝΟΜΙΟΝ**
28 τῶν Ἀμοῤῥαίων, ἐξολοθρεῦσαι ἡμᾶς. Ποῦ ἡμεῖς ἀναβαίνομεν; οἱ δὲ ἀδελφοὶ ὑμῶν ἀπέστησαν τὴν καρδίαν ὑμῶν, λέγοντες· ἔθνος μέγα καὶ πολὺ καὶ δυνατώτερον ἡμῶν, καὶ πόλεις μεγάλαι καὶ τετειχισμέναι ἕως τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, ἀλλὰ καὶ υἱοὺς γιγάντων ἑωράκαμεν ἐκεῖ.
29 Καὶ εἶπα πρὸς ὑμᾶς· μὴ πτήξητε, μηδὲ φοβηθῆτε ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν.
30 Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν ὁ προπορευόμενος πρὸ προσώπου ὑμῶν, αὐτὸς συνεμπολεμήσει αὐτοὺς μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν ὑμῖν ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ κατ᾿ ὀφθαλμοὺς ὑμῶν,
31 καὶ ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ ταύτῃ ἣν εἴδετε ὡς ἐτροφοφόρησέ σε Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου, ὡσεὶ τροφοφορήσαι ἄνθρωπος τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ, κατὰ πᾶσαν τὴν ὁδὸν ἣν ἐπορεύθητε ἕως ἤλθετε εἰς τὸν τόπον τοῦτον.
32 Καὶ ἐν τῷ λόγῳ τούτῳ οὐκ ἐνεπιστεύσατε Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ ὑμῶν,
33 ὃς πορεύεται πρότερος ὑμῶν ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ, ἐκλέγεσθαι ὑμῖν τόπον, ὁδηγῶν ὑμᾶς ἐν πυρὶ νυκτός, δεικνύων ὑμῖν τὴν ὁδὸν καθ᾿ ἣν πορεύεσθε ἐν αὐτῇ, καὶ ἐν νεφέλῃ ἡμέρας.
34 Καὶ (ὡς) ἤκουσε Κύριος τὴν φωνὴν τῶν λόγων ὑμῶν, καὶ παροξυνθεὶς ὤμοσε, λέγων·
35 εἰ ὄψεται τις τῶν ἀνδρῶν τούτων, ἡ γενεὰ πονηρὰ αὕτη, τὴν γῆν τὴν ἀγαθὴν ταύτην, ἣν ὤμοσα τοῦ δοῦναι τοῖς πατράσιν αὐτῶν·
36 πλὴν Χάλεβ υἱὸς Ἰεφοννῆ, οὗτος ὄψεται αὐτήν, καὶ τούτῳ δώσω τὴν γῆν ἐφ᾿ ἣν ἐπέβη, καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ, διὰ τὸ προσκεῖσθαι αὐτὸν τὰ πρὸς Κύριον.
37 Καὶ ἐμοὶ ἐθυμώθη Κύριος δι᾿ ὑμᾶς, λέγων· οὐδὲ σὺ οὐ μὴ εἰσέλθῃς ἐκεῖ.
38 Ἰησοῦς υἱὸς Ναυὴ ὁ παρεστηκὼς σοι, οὗτος εἰσελεύσεται ἐκεῖ· αὐτὸν κατίσχυσον, ὅτι αὐτὸς κατακληροδοτήσει αὐτὴν τῷ Ἰσραήλ.
39 Καὶ τὰ παιδία ὑμῶν, ἃ εἴπατε ἐν διαρπαγῇ ἔσεσθαι, καὶ πᾶν παιδίον νέον, ὅστις οὐκ οἶδε σήμερον ἀγαθὸν ἢ κακόν, οὗτοι εἰσελεύσονται ἐκεῖ, καὶ τούτοις δώσω αὐτήν, καὶ αὐτοὶ κληρονομήσουσιν αὐτήν.
40 Καὶ ὑμεῖς ἐπιστραφέντες ἐστρατοπεδεύσατε εἰς τὴν ἔρημον, ὁδὸν τὴν ἐπὶ τῆς ἐρυθρᾶς θαλάσσης.
41 Καὶ ἀπεκρίθητε, καὶ εἴπατέ μοι· ἡμάρτομεν ἐναντίον Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν· ἡμεῖς ἀναβάντες πολεμήσομεν κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἐνετείλατο Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν ἡμῖν. Καὶ ἀναλαβόντες ἕκαστος τὰ σκεύη τὰ πολεμικὰ αὐτοῦ, καὶ συναθροισθέντες ἀνεβαίνετε εἰς τὸ ὄρος.
42 Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς μέ· εἶπον αὐτοῖς· οὐκ ἀναβήσεσθε, οὐδὲ μὴ πολεμήσετε, οὐ γάρ εἰμι μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν, καὶ οὐ μὴ συντριβῆτε ἐνώπιον τῶν ἐχθρῶν ὑμῶν.
43 Καὶ ἐλάλησα ὑμῖν, καὶ οὐκ εἰσηκούσατέ μου· καὶ παρέβητε τὸ ῥῆμα Κυρίου, καὶ παραβιασάμενοι ἀνέβητε εἰς τὸ ὄρος.
44 Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν

### Deuteronomy

#### Chapter 1

28 of the Amorites, to utterly destroy us. Whither shall we go up? But your brethren have caused your heart to fail, saying, "A nation great and numerous and stronger than we, and cities great and fortified even unto the heavens; moreover, we have seen there sons of giants."
29 And I said unto you, "Be ye not terrified, neither be ye afraid of them.
30 The Lord your God, He that goeth before your face, He Himself shall fight for you, according to all that He hath done for you in the land of Egypt before your eyes,
31 and in this wilderness which ye have seen, how the Lord your God bore thee up, as a man might bear up his own son, throughout all the way which ye went, until ye came unto this place."
32 Yet in this matter ye did not believe the Lord your God,
33 who goeth before you in the way, to seek out for you a place, guiding you in fire by night, showing you the way wherein ye should go therein, and in a cloud by day.
34 And (as) the Lord heard the voice of your words, and being provoked to wrath, He swore, saying,
35 "If any man of these men, this evil generation, shall ever see this good land which I swore to give unto their fathers—
36 save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land whereon he trod, and to his sons, because he clave unto the Lord."
37 And the Lord was wroth with me for your sakes, saying, "Neither shalt thou, no, thou shalt not enter thither.
38 Joshua the son of Nun, who standeth before thee, he shall enter thither; him do thou strengthen, for he himself shall cause Israel to inherit it.
39 And your children, whom ye said would be for a spoil, and every young child who knoweth not this day good or evil, these shall enter thither, and to these will I give it, and they themselves shall inherit it."
40 And ye turned and pitched camp in the wilderness, by the way of the Red Sea.
41 Then ye answered and said unto me, "We have sinned against the Lord our God; we will go up and fight, according to all things whatsoever the Lord our God commanded us." And each man having taken up his weapons of war, and being gathered together, ye went up into the mountain.
42 And the Lord said unto me, "Say unto them, 'Ye shall not go up, neither shall ye fight; for I am not with you, lest ye be crushed before your enemies.'"
43 And I spake unto you, but ye hearkened not unto me; and ye transgressed the word of the Lord, and presumptuously ye went up into the mountain.
44 And went forth
