### Genesis Chapter 7

**Original Greek (with OCR corrections):**
22 τῶν θηρίων, καὶ πᾶν ἑρπετὸν κινούμενον ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, καὶ πᾶς
23 ἄνθρωπος· καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἔχει πνοὴν ζωῆς, καὶ πᾶς ὃς ἦν ἐπὶ
τῆς ξηρᾶς, ἀπέθανε. Καὶ ἐξήλειψε πᾶν τὸ ἀνάστημα, ὃ ἦν ἐπὶ
προσώπου (πάσης) τῆς γῆς, ἀπὸ ἀνθρώπου ἕως κτήνους καὶ ἑρπετῶν
τῶν καὶ τῶν πετεινῶν τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ ἐξηλείφθησαν ἀπὸ τῆς
γῆς· καὶ κατελείφθη μόνος Νῶε, καὶ οἱ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ κιβωτῷ.
24 Καὶ ὑψώθη τὸ ὕδωρ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς ἡμέρας ἑκατὸν πεντήκοντα.

### Genesis Chapter 8

**Original Greek (with OCR corrections):**
1 ΚΑΙ ἐμνήσθη ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ Νῶε, καὶ πάντων τῶν θηρίων, καὶ
πάντων τῶν κτηνῶν, καὶ πάντων τῶν πετεινῶν, καὶ πάντων τῶν
ἑρπετῶν, ὅσα ἦν μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ κιβωτῷ· καὶ ἐπήγαγεν ὁ Θεὸς
πνεῦμα ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, καὶ ἐκόπασε τὸ ὕδωρ.
2 Καὶ ἐπεκαλύφθησαν αἱ πηγαὶ τῆς ἀβύσσου, καὶ οἱ καταράκται τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ συ-
νεσχέθη ὁ ὑετὸς ἀπὸ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ·
3 καὶ ἐνεδίδου τὸ ὕδωρ πορευόμενον ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς· ἐνεδίδου τὸ ὕδωρ καὶ ἡλαττονοῦτο μετὰ πεν-
τήκοντα καὶ ἑκατὸν ἡμέρας.
4 Καὶ ἐκάθισεν ἡ κιβωτὸς ἐν μηνὶ τῷ ἑβδόμῳ, ἑβδόμῃ καὶ εἰκάδι τοῦ μηνός, ἐπὶ τὰ ὄρη τὰ Ἀραράτ.
5 Τὸ δὲ ὕδωρ πορευόμενον ἡλαττονοῦτο ἕως τοῦ δεκάτου μηνός·
ἐν δὲ τῷ δεκάτῳ μηνί, τῇ πρώτῃ τοῦ μηνός, ὤφθησαν αἱ κε-
φαλαὶ τῶν ὀρέων.
6 Καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ τεσσαράκοντα ἡμέρας ἠνέω-
ξε Νῶε τὴν θυρίδα τῆς κιβωτοῦ ἣν ἐποίησε, καὶ ἀπέστειλε τὸν
7 κόρακα (τοῦ ἰδεῖν εἰ κεκόπακε τὸ ὕδωρ)· καὶ ἐξελθών, οὐχ ὑ-
πέστρεψεν ἕως τοῦ ξηρανθῆναι τὸ ὕδωρ ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς.
8 Καὶ ἀπέ-
στειλε τὴν περιστεράν ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ, ἰδεῖν εἰ κεκόπακε τὸ ὕδωρ
9 ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς· καὶ οὐχ εὑροῦσα ἡ περιστερὰ ἀνάπαυσιν τοῖς πο-
σὶν αὐτῆς, ἀνέστρεψε πρὸς αὐτὸν εἰς τὴν κιβωτόν, ὅτι ὕδωρ ἦν
ἐπὶ παντὶ προσώπῳ πάσης τῆς γῆς. Καὶ ἐκτείνας τὴν χεῖρα
αὐτοῦ, ἔλαβεν αὐτήν, καὶ εἰσήγαγεν αὐτὴν πρὸς ἑαυτὸν εἰς τὴν
10 κιβωτόν. Καὶ ἐπισχὼν ἔτι ἡμέρας ἑπτὰ ἑτέρας, πάλιν ἐξαπέστει-
11 λε τὴν περιστερὰν ἐκ τῆς κιβωτοῦ· καὶ ἀνέστρεψε πρὸς αὐτὸν ἡ
περιστερὰ τὸ πρὸς ἑσπέραν, καὶ εἶχε φύλλον ἐλαίας κάρφος ἐν
τῷ στόματι αὐτῆς· καὶ ἔγνω Νῶε ὅτι κεκόπακε τὸ ὕδωρ ἀπὸ
12 τῆς γῆς. Καὶ ἐπισχὼν ἔτι ἡμέρας ἑπτὰ ἑτέρας, πάλιν ἐξαπέ-
στειλε τὴν περιστεράν, καὶ οὐ προσέθετο τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι πρὸς αὐ-

**English Translation:**

### Genesis 7

22 [even] of the beasts, and every creeping thing that moveth upon the earth, and every man;
23 And all things which had the breath of life, and every one that was upon the dry land, died. And He blotted out all the upstanding life that was upon the face (of all) the earth, from man even unto cattle, and of the creeping things, even of the fowls of the heaven, and they were blotted out from the earth. And there was left only Noah, and they that were with him in the ark.
24 And the water prevailed upon the earth for an hundred and fifty days.

### Genesis 8

1 And God remembered Noah, and all the beasts, and all the cattle, and all the fowls, and all the creeping things which were with him in the ark. And God brought forth a wind upon the earth, and the water assuaged.
2 And the fountains of the deep were stopped, and the cataracts of heaven, and the rain from heaven was restrained.
3 And the water receded continually from the earth; the water did recede, and it diminished after an hundred and fifty days.
4 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.
5 And the water continually diminished until the tenth month; and in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were seen the tops of the mountains.
6 And it came to pass after forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made, and he sent forth the raven
7 (to see if the water had assuaged); and it went forth and returned not, until the water was dried up from off the earth.
8 And he sent forth the dove after him, to see if the water had assuaged from off the earth.
9 But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark; for the water was upon the face of all the earth. And he put forth his hand, and took her, and drew her in unto him into the ark.
10 And he waited yet another seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark.
11 And the dove returned unto him in the evening; and lo, she had in her mouth a plucked olive leaf, a dried sprig. And Noah knew that the water had assuaged from off the earth.
12 And he waited yet another seven days; and again he sent forth the dove, and she returned not again unto him.
