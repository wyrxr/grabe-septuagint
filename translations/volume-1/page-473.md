2 καὶ ἐκώδευσαν ὅλην τὴν νύκτα, λέγοντες· Ἕως φωτὸς πρωΐ·
3 μείνωμεν, καὶ ἀποκτείνωμεν αὐτόν. Καὶ ἐκοιμήθη Σαμψὼν ἕως μεσονυκτίου· καὶ ἀνέστη περὶ τὸ μεσονύκτιον, καὶ ἐπελάβετο τῶν θυρῶν τῆς πύλης τῆς πόλεως καὶ τῶν δύο σταθμῶν, καὶ ἀνεβάστασεν αὐτὰς σὺν τῷ μοχλῷ, καὶ ἐπέθηκεν ἐπὶ τῷ ὤμῳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀνήνεγκεν αὐτὰ ἐπὶ τὴν κορυφὴν τοῦ ὄρους, ὃ ἔστιν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον Χεβρῶν, καὶ ἔθηκεν αὐτὰ ἐκεῖ.
4 Καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ ταῦτα, καὶ ἠγάπησε γυναῖκα ἐπὶ τοῦ χειμάῤῥου Σωρήκ· καὶ ὄνομα αὐτῇ
5 Δαλιδά. Καὶ ἀνέβησαν πρὸς αὐτὴν οἱ σατράπαι τῶν ἀλλοφύλων, καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς αὐτήν· ἀπάτησον αὐτόν, καὶ ἴδε ἐν τίνι ἡ ἰσχὺς αὐτοῦ ἔστιν ἡ μεγάλη, καὶ ἐν τίνι δυνησόμεθα πρὸς αὐτόν, καὶ δήσομεν αὐτὸν ὥστε ταπεινῶσαι αὐτόν, καὶ ἡμεῖς δώσομεν σοι ἀνὴρ χιλίους καὶ ἑκατὸν ἀργυρίου.
6 Καὶ εἶπε Δαλιδὰ πρὸς Σαμψών· ἀνάγγειλον δὴ μοι ἐν τίνι ἡ ἰσχὺς σου ἡ μεγάλη, καὶ ἐν τίνι δέθητι τοῦ ταπεινωθῆναί σε;
7 Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτὴν Σαμψών· ἐὰν δήσωσι με ἐν ἑπτὰ νευραῖς ὑγραῖς μὴ ἠρημωμέναις, καὶ ἀσθενήσω, καὶ ἔσομαι ὡς εἷς τῶν ἀνθρώπων.
8 Καὶ ἀνήνεγκαν αὐτῇ οἱ σατράπαι τῶν ἀλλοφύλων ἑπτὰ νευρὰς ὑγρὰς μὴ ἠρημωμένας, καὶ ἔδησεν αὐτὸν ἐν αὐταῖς.
9 Καὶ τὸ ἔνεδρον αὐτοῦ ἐκάθητο αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ ταμείῳ· καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτόν· ἀλλόφυλοι ἐπί σε Σαμψών. Καὶ διέρρηξε τὰς νευράς, ὃν τρόπον διασπᾶται κλῶσμα τοῦ ἀποτινάγματος ἐν τῷ ὀσφρανθῆναι αὐτὸ πυρός· καὶ οὐκ ἐγνώσθη ἡ ἰσχὺς αὐτοῦ.
10 Καὶ εἶπε Δαλιδὰ πρὸς Σαμψών· ἰδοὺ παρελογίσω με, καὶ ἐλάλησας πρὸς με ψεύδη· νῦν ἀνάγγειλον δὴ μοι, ἐν τίνι δέθητι;
11 Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτήν· ἐὰν δεσμῷ δήσωσι με ἐν ἑπτὰ καλωδίοις καινοῖς, ἐν οἷς οὐκ ἐγενήθη ἔργον, καὶ ἀσθενήσω, καὶ ἔσομαι ὡς εἷς τῶν ἀνθρώπων.
12 Καὶ ἔλαβεν (αὐτῷ) Δαλιδὰ καλώδια καινά, καὶ ἔδησεν αὐτὸν ἐν αὐτοῖς, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτόν· οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι ἐπί σε Σαμψών· καὶ τὸ ἔνεδρον ἐκάθητο ἐν τῷ ταμείῳ. Καὶ ἔσπασεν αὐτὰ ἀπὸ τῶν βραχιόνων αὐτοῦ ὡς ῥάμμα.
13 Καὶ εἶπε Δαλιδὰ πρὸς Σαμψών· ἕως νῦν παρελογίσω με, καὶ ἐλάλησας πρὸς με ψεύδη· ἀνάγγειλον δὴ μοι ἐν τίνι δεθήσῃ. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτήν· ἐὰν ὑφάνῃς τὰς ἑπτὰ σειρὰς τῆς κεφαλῆς μου μετὰ τοῦ διάσματος, καὶ ἐγκρούσῃς ἐν τῷ πασσάλῳ εἰς τὸν τοῖχον, καὶ ἔσομαι ἀσθενὴς ὡς εἷς τῶν ἀνθρώπων.
14 Καὶ ἐκοίμισεν αὐτὸν Δαλιδά, καὶ ἐδιάσατο τοὺς ἑπτὰ βοστρύχους τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ μετὰ τῆς ἐκτάσεως, καὶ κατέχρουσεν ἐν τοῖς πασσάλοις.

### Judges Chapter 16

**2.** ...and they kept watch all the night, saying, "Until the morning light;
**3.** Let us wait, and we shall slay him." But Samson slept until midnight; and he rose about midnight, and took hold of the doors of the city gate, and the two doorposts, and he lifted them up with the bar, and laid them upon his shoulder, and carried them up to the top of the mountain which is before Hebron, and laid them there.

**4.** And it came to pass after these things, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek; and her name was
**5.** Delilah. And the lords of the Philistines went up unto her, and said unto her, "Deceive him, and see wherein his great strength lieth, and by what means we may prevail against him, and we shall bind him to humble him; and we ourselves shall give thee, each man, one thousand and one hundred [pieces] of silver."

**6.** And Delilah said unto Samson, "Tell me now, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith must thou be bound that thou mayest be humbled?"
**7.** And Samson said unto her, "If they bind me with seven fresh sinews that have not been dried, then shall I become weak, and be as one of other men."
**8.** Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven fresh sinews that had not been dried, and she bound him therewith.
**9.** Now there were men lying in wait for him in the inner chamber; and she said unto him, "The Philistines are upon thee, Samson!" And he broke the sinews, even as a thread of tow is broken when it doth smell fire; and his strength was not known.

**10.** And Delilah said unto Samson, "Behold, thou hast deceived me, and spoken lies unto me. Now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mayest be bound."
**11.** And he said unto her, "If they do bind me fast with seven new cords that have not been used for work, then shall I become weak, and be as one of other men."
**12.** And Delilah took [for him] new cords, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, "The Philistines are upon thee, Samson!" And the men lying in wait sat in the inner chamber. And he plucked them from off his arms as a thread.

**13.** And Delilah said unto Samson, "Until now hast thou deceived me, and spoken lies unto me. Tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mayest be bound." And he said unto her, "If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web, and fastenest them with a pin into the wall, then shall I become weak as one of other men."
**14.** And Delilah made him sleep, and wove the seven tresses of his head with the warp, and drove down with the pegs.
