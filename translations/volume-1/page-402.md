ΚΕΦ. Ζʹ. Ηʹ. ΙΗΣΟΥΣ ΝΑΥΗ 387
18 ἦχθη δῆμος ὁ Ζαριεὶ κατ᾽ ἄνδρας, καὶ ἀνεδείχθη ὁ Ζαβδί. Καὶ
προσήχθη ὁ οἶκος αὐτοῦ κατ᾽ ἄνδρα, καὶ ἐνεδείχθη Ἄχαν υἱὸς
Ζαμβρὶ υἱοῦ Ζαρὰ ἀπὸ φυλῆς Ἰούδα.
19 Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰησοῦς τῷ Ἄχαν· υἱέ μου, δὸς δὴ δόξαν σήμερον τῷ Κυρίῳ
Θεῷ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ δὸς αὐτῷ τὴν ἐξομολόγησιν, καὶ ἀνάγγειλόν μοι τί ἐποίησας,
καὶ μὴ κρύψῃς ἀπ᾽ ἐμοῦ.
20 Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Ἄχαν τῷ Ἰησοῖ, καὶ εἶπεν· ἀληθῶς ἐγὼ ἥμαρτον ἐναντίον
Κυρίου Θεοῦ Ἰσραήλ· οὕτως καὶ οὕτως ἐποίησα·
21 ἴδον ἐν τῇ προνομῇ ψιλὴν ποικίλην μίαν καλήν, καὶ διακόσια δίδραχμα
ἀργυρίου, καὶ γλῶσσαν μίαν χρυσῆν, πεντήκοντα διδράχμων ὁλκὴ αὐτῆς·
καὶ ἐνθυμηθεὶς αὐτῶν, ἔλαβον αὐτά·
22 καὶ ἰδοὺ αὐτὰ ἐγκέκρυπται ἐν τῇ γῇ ἐν τῇ σκηνῇ μου, καὶ τὸ ἀργύριον
κέκρυπται ὑποκάτω αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ἰησοῦς ἀγγέλους, καὶ ἔδραμον
εἰς τὴν σκηνὴν εἰς τὴν παρεμβολήν· καὶ ταῦτα ἦν κεκρυμμένα εἰς τὴν σκηνὴν
αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὸ ἀργύριον ὑποκάτω αὐτῶν.
23 Καὶ ἐξήνεγκαν αὐτὰ ἐκ τῆς σκηνῆς, καὶ ἤνεγκαν αὐτὰ πρὸς Ἰησοῦν
καὶ πρὸς πάντας τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἔθηκαν αὐτὰ ἔναντι Κυρίου.
24 Καὶ ἔλαβεν Ἰησοῦς τὸν Ἄχαν υἱὸν Ζαρὰ, καὶ ἀνήγαγεν αὐτὸν εἰς
φάραγγα Ἀχώρ, καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοὺς
μόσχους αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰ ὑποζύγια αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντα τὰ πρόβατα αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὴν
σκηνὴν αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντα τὰ ὑπάρχοντα αὐτοῦ, καὶ πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ·
καὶ ἀνήγαγεν αὐτὸν εἰς Ἐμὲκ Ἀχώρ.
25 Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰησοῦς· τί ὠλέθρευσας ἡμᾶς; ἐξολοθρεύσαί σε Κύριος, καθὰ
καὶ σήμερον. Καὶ ἐλιθοβόλησαν αὐτὸν πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ ἐν λίθοις, καὶ κατέκαυσαν
αὐτὰ ἐν πυρί, καὶ ἐλιθοβόλησαν αὐτοὺς ἐν λίθοις.
26 Καὶ ἐπέστησαν αὐτῷ σωρὸν λίθων μέγαν ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης·
καὶ ἐπαύσατο Κύριος τοῦ θυμοῦ τῆς ὀργῆς αὐτοῦ· διὰ τοῦτο ἐπωνόμασεν
αὐτὸ Ἐμὲκ Ἀχώρ ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης.

ΚΕΦ. Ηʹ. VIII.

1 ΚΑΙ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Ἰησοῦν· μὴ φοβηθῇς, μηδὲ δειλιάσῃς· λάβε μετὰ
σεαυτοῦ πάντας τοὺς ἄνδρας τοὺς πολεμιστάς, καὶ ἀναστὰς ἀνάβηθι εἰς Γαΐ·
ἰδοὺ δέδωκα εἰς τὰς χεῖράς σου τὸν βασιλέα Γαΐ, καὶ τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὴν
πόλιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ.
2 Καὶ ποιήσεις τῇ Γαΐ καὶ τῷ βασιλεῖ αὐτῆς, ὃν τρόπον ἐποίησας τῇ
Ἱεριχὼ καὶ τῷ βασιλεῖ αὐτῆς·

**Joshua 7**

18 Then the family of Zariei was brought near by men, and Zabdi was pointed out.
And his household was brought near, man by man, and Achan, the son of Zambri,
the son of Zara, of the tribe of Judah, was pointed out.
19 And Joshua said unto Achan, "My son, I pray thee, give glory this day
unto the Lord God of Israel, and make confession unto Him;
and declare unto me what thou hast done, and hide it not from me."
20 And Achan answered Joshua, and said, "Verily, I have sinned against
the Lord God of Israel; thus and thus have I done.
21 I saw among the spoil a beautiful ornate cloak, and two hundred didrachmas of silver,
and one golden wedge whose weight was fifty didrachmas;
and I coveted them, and I took them.
22 And behold, they are hidden in the earth within my tent,
and the silver is hidden beneath them."
And Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent within the camp;
and these things were found hidden in his tent, and the silver beneath them.
23 And they brought them forth out of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua
and unto all the elders of Israel, and they laid them before the Lord.
24 And Joshua took Achan, the son of Zara, and brought him up into the valley of Achor,
and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and all his sheep,
and his tent, and all his possessions; and all Israel was with him.
And he brought him up into Emek Achor.
25 And Joshua said, "Wherefore hast thou brought destruction upon us?
The Lord shall bring destruction upon thee this day!"
And all Israel stoned him with stones; and they burned them with fire,
and stoned them with stones.
26 And they raised over him a great heap of stones, that remaineth unto this day.
And the Lord turned from the fierceness of His wrath.
Therefore the name of that place was called Emek Achor unto this day.

**Joshua 8**

1 And the Lord said unto Joshua, "Fear not, neither be thou dismayed.
Take with thee all the men of war, and arise, go up to Ai;
behold, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people,
and his city, and his land.
2 And thou shalt do to Ai and to her king as thou didst unto Jericho
and unto her king."
