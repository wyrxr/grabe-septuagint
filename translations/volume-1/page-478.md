πυλῶνος, οἱ ἐκ τῶν υἱῶν Δάν. Καὶ ἀνέβησαν οἱ πέντε ἄνδρες οἱ 17
πορευόμενοι κατασκέψασθαι τὴν γῆν· ἐπελθόντες ἐκεῖ ἔλαβον τὸ
γλυπτόν, καὶ τὸ Ἐφούδ, καὶ τὸ Θεραφείμ, καὶ τὸ χωνευτόν· καὶ
ὁ ἱερεὺς ἐστηλωμένος παρὰ τῇ θύρᾳ τοῦ πυλῶνος, καὶ οἱ ἑξακό-
σιοι ἄνδρες περιεζωσμένοι σκεύη πολεμικά. Καὶ οὗτοι εἰσῆλθον εἰς 18
οἶκον Μειχά, καὶ ἔλαβον τὸ γλυπτόν, καὶ τὸ Ἐφούδ, καὶ τὸ Θε-
ραφείμ, καὶ τὸ χωνευτόν. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτοὺς ὁ ἱερεύς· τί ὑμεῖς
ποιεῖτε; Καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς αὐτόν· χώρευσον, ἐπίθες τὴν χεῖρά σου 19
ἐπὶ τὸ στόμα σου, καὶ ἐλθὲ μεθ᾿ ἡμῶν, καὶ ἔσῃ ἡμῖν εἰς πα-
τέρα καὶ εἰς ἱερέα· μὴ βέλτιον εἶναί σε ἱερέα οἴκου ἀνδρὸς
ἑνός, ἢ γίνεσθαί σε ἱερέα φυλῆς καὶ συγγενείας ἐν Ἰσραήλ; Καὶ 20
ἐγαθύνθη ἡ καρδία τοῦ ἱερέως, καὶ ἔλαβε τὸ Ἐφούδ, καὶ τὸ Θε-
ραφείμ, καὶ τὸ γλυπτόν, καὶ τὸ χωνευτόν, καὶ εἰσῆλθεν ἐν μέ-
σω τοῦ λαοῦ. Καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν, καὶ ἀπῆλθαν· καὶ ἔθηκαν τὴν πα- 21
νοικείαν καὶ τὴν κτῆσιν αὐτοῦ τὴν ἔνδοξον ἔμπροσθεν αὐτῶν. Αὐ- 22
τῶν δὲ μεμακρυνκότων ἀπὸ τοῦ οἴκου Μειχά, καὶ ἰδοὺ Μειχά
καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες (ὁ λαός) οἱ ὄντες ἐν τοῖς οἴκοις οἱ σὺν τῷ οἴκῳ
μετὰ Μειχά, ἔκραζον κατοπίσω Δάν, καὶ ἐβόησαν πρὸς τοὺς υἱ- 23
οὺς Δάν· καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν οἱ υἱοὶ Δὰν κατὰ πρόσωπον αὐτῶν, καὶ
εἶπαν πρὸς Μειχά· τί ἐστί σοι, ὅτι ἐβόησας; Καὶ εἶπε Μειχά· ὅτι 24
τὰ γλυπτόν μου, ὃ ἐποίησα, ἐλάβετε, καὶ τὸν ἱερέα, καὶ ἀπήλα-
βατε· καὶ τί ἐμοὶ ἔτι; καὶ τί τοῦτο λέγετέ μοι· τί τοῦτο κράζεις;
Καὶ εἶπον πρὸς αὐτὸν οἱ υἱοὶ Δὰν· μὴ ἀκουσθήτω δὴ ἡ φωνή 25
σου μεθ᾿ ἡμῶν, μήποτε ἀπαντήσωσιν ὑμῖν ἄνδρες πικροὶ ψυχῇ,
καὶ προσθήσεις τὴν ψυχήν σου, καὶ τὴν ψυχὴν τοῦ οἴκου σου.
Καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Δὰν εἰς τὴν ὁδὸν αὐτῶν· καὶ εἶδε Μει- 26
χὰ ὅτι ἰσχυρότεροι εἰσιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐξένευσε, καὶ ἀνέστρεψεν εἰς
τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ. Καὶ αὐτοὶ ἔλαβον ὅσα ἐποίησε Μειχά, καὶ 27
τὸν ἱερέα ὃς ἦν αὐτῷ, καὶ ἦλθον ἕως Λαισά, ἐπὶ λαὸν ἡσυχάζον-
τα καὶ πεποιθότα· καὶ ἐπάταξαν αὐτοὺς ἐν στόματι ῥομφαίας,
καὶ τὴν πόλιν ἐνέπρησαν ἐν πυρί· καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἐξαιρούμενος, 28
ὅτι μακράν ἐστι ἀπὸ Σιδωνίων, καὶ λόγος οὐκ ἔστιν αὐτοῖς μετὰ ἀν-
θρώπων, καὶ αὐτὴ ἐν κοιλάδι, ἡ ἐστι τοῦ οἴκου Ῥοώβ· καὶ ᾠ-
κοδόμησαν τὴν πόλιν, καὶ κατώκησαν ἐν αὐτῇ. Καὶ ἐκάλεσαν τὸ 29
ὄνομα τῆς πόλεως Δάν, κατὰ τὸ ὄνομα Δὰν τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῶν,
ὃς ἐγενήθη τῷ Ἰσραήλ· καὶ ἦν Λαεὶς ὄνομα τῇ πόλει τὸ πρό-

### Judges Chapter 18

**16.** ...the gate, [even] they that were of the sons of Dan.
**17.** And the five men who went to spy out the land went up; and having come thither, they took the graven image, and the Ephod, and the Teraphim, and the molten image. And the priest stood by the door of the gate, and the six hundred men were girded with implements of war.
**18.** And these entered into the house of Micah, and they took the graven image, and the Ephod, and the Teraphim, and the molten image. And the priest said unto them, "What do you?"
**19.** And they said unto him, "Hold your peace, and lay your hand upon your mouth, and come with us, and you shall be unto us a father and a priest. Is it not better for you to be a priest unto the house of one man, than to be a priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel?"
**20.** And the heart of the priest was gladdened, and he took the Ephod, and the Teraphim, and the graven image, and the molten image, and went in among the people.
**21.** And they turned back, and departed; and they set his whole household and his glorious possessions before them.
**22.** But when they had gone far from the house of Micah, behold, Micah and the men (the people) who were in the houses, [even] the household with Micah, cried out after Dan,
**23.** and they cried out unto the sons of Dan. And the sons of Dan turned their faces unto them, and said unto Micah, "What ails you, that you cried out?"
**24.** And Micah said, "My graven image, which I made, you have taken, and the priest, and have carried him away; and what have I more? And why say you unto me, 'Why do you cry out thus?'"
**25.** And the sons of Dan said unto him, "Let not your voice be heard among us, we pray you, lest fierce men meet you, and you lose your life, and the life of your household."
**26.** And the sons of Dan went on their way; and Micah saw that they were stronger than he, and he turned aside, and returned unto his house.
**27.** And they took all that Micah had made, and the priest who was with him, and came unto Laish, unto a people quiet and trusting; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burned the city with fire.
**28.** And there was none to deliver [them]; for it was far from the Sidonians, and no dealings had they with other men; and it [the city] was in a valley, which belonged unto the house of Rehob. And they built the city, and dwelt therein.
**29.** And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel; and Laish was the name of the city aforetime.
