9 πρὸς Φαραώ, καὶ ἐκ χειρὸς τῶν Αἰγυπτίων. Ἐξέστη δὲ Ἰοθὸρ ἐπὶ
    πᾶσι τοῖς ἀγαθοῖς οἷς ἐποίησε Κύριος αὐτοῖς, ὅτι ἐξείλατο (Κύριος)
10 αὐτοὺς ἐκ χειρὸς τῶν Αἰγυπτίων, καὶ ἐκ χειρὸς Φαραώ. Καὶ
    εἶπεν Ἰοθὸρ· εὐλογητὸς Κύριος, ὅτι ἐξείλατο τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ ἐκ χει-
11 ρὸς Αἰγυπτίων, καὶ ἐκ χειρὸς Φαραώ. Νῦν ἔγνων ὅτι μέγας Κύριος
12 παρὰ πάντας τοὺς θεούς, ἕνεκεν τούτου ὅτι ἐπέθεντο αὐτοῖς. Καὶ
    ἔλαβεν Ἰοθὸρ ὁ γαμβρὸς Μωσῆ ὁλοκαυτώματα καὶ θυσίας τῷ Θεῷ·
    παρεγένετο δὲ καὶ Ἀαρὼν καὶ πάντες οἱ πρεσβύτεροι Ἰσραήλ, φα-
13 γεῖν ἄρτον μετὰ τοῦ γαμβροῦ Μωσῆ ἐναντίον τοῦ Θεοῦ. Καὶ ἐγέ-
    νετο μετὰ τὴν ἐπαύριον, συνεκάθισε Μωσῆς κρίνειν τὸν λαόν· πα-
14 ρειστήκει δὲ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς Μωσῇ ἀπὸ πρωΐθεν ἕως ἑσπέρας. Καὶ
    ἰδὼν Ἰοθὸρ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίει τῷ λαῷ, λέγει· τί τοῦτο ὃ σὺ ποι-
15 εῖς τῷ λαῷ; διατί σὺ κάθησαι μόνος, πᾶς δὲ ὁ λαὸς παρέστηκε
    σοι ἀπὸ πρωΐ ἕως δείλης; Καὶ λέγει Μωσῆς τῷ γαμβρῷ αὐτοῦ·
    ὅτι παραγίνεται πρὸς με ὁ λαός, ἐκζητῆσαι κρίσιν παρὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ.
16 Ὅταν γὰρ γένηται αὐτοῖς ἀντιλογία, καὶ ἔλθωσι πρὸς με, δια-
    κρίνω ἕκαστον, καὶ συμβιβάζω αὐτοὺς τὰ προστάγματα τοῦ Θεοῦ
17 καὶ τὸν νόμον αὐτοῦ. Εἶπε δὲ ὁ γαμβρὸς Μωσῆ πρὸς αὐτόν· οὐκ
18 ὀρθῶς σὺ ποιεῖς τὸ ρῆμα τοῦτο· φθορᾷ καταφθαρήσῃ ἀνυπονήτῳ
    καὶ σύ, καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαός (σου) οὗτος, ὅς ἐστι μετὰ σοῦ· βαρύ σοι
19 τὸ ρῆμα τοῦτο, οὐ δυνήσῃ ποιεῖν αὐτὸ σὺ μόνος. Νῦν οὖν ἄκου-
    σόν μου, καὶ συμβουλεύσω σοι, καὶ ἔσται ὁ Θεὸς μετὰ σοῦ. Γίνου
    σὺ τῷ λαῷ τὰ πρὸς τὸν Θεόν, καὶ ἀνοίσεις τοὺς λόγους αὐτῶν
20 πρὸς τὸν Θεόν· καὶ διαμαρτύρῃ αὐτοῖς τὰ προστάγματα τοῦ Θεοῦ
    καὶ τὸν νόμον αὐτοῦ, καὶ σημανεῖς αὐτοῖς τὰς ὁδοὺς ἐν αἷς πο-
21 ρεύσονται ἐν αὐταῖς, καὶ τὰ ἔργα ἃ ποιήσουσι. Καὶ σὺ σεαυτῷ
    σκέψαι ἀπὸ παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ ἄνδρας δυνατούς, θεοσεβεῖς, ἄνδρας
    δικαίους, μισοῦντας ὑπερηφανίαν, καὶ καταστήσεις αὐτοὺς ἐπ᾽ αὐ-
22 τῶν χιλιάρχους καὶ ἑκατοντάρχους καὶ πεντηκοντάρχους καὶ δε-
    καδάρχους καὶ γραμματοεισαγωγεῖς, καὶ κρινοῦσι τὸν λαὸν πᾶσαν
    ὥραν· τὸ δὲ ρῆμα τὸ ὑπέρογκον ἀνοίσουσιν ἐπὶ σέ, τὰ δὲ βρα-
    χέα τῶν κριμάτων κρινοῦσιν αὐτοί, καὶ κουφίσουσιν ἀπὸ σοῦ, καὶ
23 συναντιλήψονταί σοι. Ἐὰν τὸ ρῆμα τοῦτο ποιήσῃς , καὶ κατισ-
    χύσει σε ὁ Θεός, καὶ δυνήσῃ παραστῆναι, καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς οὗτος
24 ἥξει εἰς τὸν τόπον αὐτοῦ μετ᾽ εἰρήνης. Ἤκουσε δὲ Μωσῆς τῆς
25 φωνῆς τοῦ γαμβροῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐποίησε πάντα ὅσα αὐτῷ εἶπε. Καὶ

**Translation:**

9 from Pharaoh, and from the hand of the Egyptians. And Jethro rejoiced greatly over all the good which the Lord had wrought for them, because the Lord had delivered
10 them from the hand of the Egyptians, and from the hand of Pharaoh. And Jethro said, "Blessed be the Lord, who hath delivered His people from the hand of the
11 Egyptians, and from the hand of Pharaoh. Now have I known that the Lord is great above all gods, because of this, that they had assailed them."
12 And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took burnt offerings and sacrifices unto God; and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to
13 eat bread with Moses' father-in-law before God. And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people; and
14 all the people stood by Moses from morning until evening. And when Jethro saw all that he did for the people, he said, "What is this thing that thou
15 doest for the people? Wherefore sittest thou alone, and all the people stand before thee from morning until evening?" And Moses said unto his father-in-law, "Because the people come unto me to seek judgment from God.
16 For when there is a dispute among them, and they come unto me, I judge each one, and I make known unto them the ordinances of God
17 and His law." And Moses' father-in-law said unto him, "Thou dost not well in this thing.
18 Thou shalt surely be worn out with an unbearable toil, both thou, and all this people of thine that is with thee; for this thing is too heavy for thee;
19 thou canst not perform it alone. Now therefore hearken unto me, and I will counsel thee, and God shall be with thee. Be thou for the people [in matters] pertaining unto God, and thou shalt bring their words
20 unto God; and thou shalt instruct them concerning the ordinances of God and His law, and thou shalt show them the ways in which they shall
21 walk therein, and the works which they shall do. And thou shalt for thyself seek out from among all the people able men, God-fearing men, men of righteousness, hating haughtiness, and thou shalt appoint them over
22 them, chiefs of thousands, and chiefs of hundreds, and chiefs of fifties, and chiefs of tens, and scribes, and they shall judge the people at all times; but every weighty matter they shall bring unto thee, and the lesser judgments they shall judge themselves; and they shall lighten [the burden] from thee, and
23 they shall aid thee. If thou shalt do this thing, and God shall make thee strong, then shalt thou be able to endure, and all this people
24 shall come unto their place in peace." And Moses hearkened unto the voice
25 of his father-in-law, and did all things whatsoever he had said unto him.
