ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ ΚΕΦ. ΚΓʹ. ΚΔʹ.

11  ὁ Χετταῖος πρὸς Ἀβραάμ, εἶπεν, ἀκουόντων τῶν υἱῶν Χὲτ καὶ
    πάντων τῶν εἰσπορευομένων εἰς τὴν πόλιν, λέγων· παρ᾿ ἐμοὶ γε-
    νοῦ κύριε, καὶ ἄκουσόν μου. Τὸν ἀγρὸν καὶ τὸ σπήλαιον τὸ ἐν αὐ-
    τῷ, σοὶ δίδωμι· ἐναντίον τῶν πολιτῶν μου δέδωκά σοι· θάψον τὸν
12 νεκρόν σου. Καὶ προσεκύνησεν Ἀβραὰμ ἐναντίον τοῦ λαοῦ τῆς γῆς,
13 καὶ εἶπε τῷ Ἔφρων εἰς τὰ ὦτα (ἐναντίον) παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ τῆς
    γῆς· ἐπειδὴ πρὸς ἐμοῦ εἶ, ἄκουσόν μου· Τὸ ἀργύριον τοῦ ἀγροῦ
14 λάβε παρ᾿ ἐμοῦ, καὶ θάψω τὸν νεκρόν μου ἐκεῖ. Ἀπεκρίθη δὲ Ἔ-
15 φρων τῷ Ἀβραάμ, λέγων· οὐχὶ κύριε· ἀκήκοα γάρ, γῆ τετρακο-
    σίων διδράχμων ἀργυρίου ἀνὰ μέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ σοῦ τί ἂν εἴη τοῦτο;
16 σὺ δὲ τὸν νεκρόν σου θάψον. Καὶ ἤκουσεν Ἀβραὰμ τοῦ Ἔφρων,
    καὶ ἀπεκατέστησεν Ἀβραὰμ τῷ Ἔφρων τὸ ἀργύριον, ὃ ἐλάλησεν
    εἰς τὰ ὦτα τῶν υἱῶν Χέτ, τετρακόσια δίδραχμα ἀργυρίου δοκί-
17 μου ἐμπόροις. Καὶ ἔστη ὁ ἀγρὸς Ἔφρων, ὃς ἦν ἐν τῷ διπλῷ σπη-
    λαίῳ, ὃς ἐστι κατὰ πρόσωπον Μαμβρῆ, ὁ ἀγρὸς καὶ τὸ σπήλαιον
    ὃ ἦν ἐν αὐτῷ, καὶ πᾶν δένδρον ὃ ἦν ἐν τῷ ἀγρῷ, ὃ ἔστιν ἐν πᾶσι
18 τοῖς ὁρίοις αὐτοῦ κύκλῳ, τῷ Ἀβραὰμ εἰς κτῆσιν, ἐναντίον τῶν
19 υἱῶν Χὲτ καὶ πάντων τῶν εἰσπορευομένων εἰς τὴν πόλιν. Μετὰ
    ταῦτα ἔθαψεν Ἀβραὰμ Σάρραν τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ σπηλαίῳ
    τοῦ ἀγροῦ τῷ διπλῷ, ὃ ἐστιν ἀπέναντι Μαμβρῆ· αὕτη ἐστὶ Χεβρὼν
20 ἐν τῇ γῇ Χαναάν. Καὶ ἐκυρώθη ὁ ἀγρὸς καὶ τὸ σπήλαιον ὃ ἦν
    ἐν αὐτῷ, τῷ Ἀβραὰμ εἰς κτῆσιν τάφου, παρὰ τῶν υἱῶν Χέτ.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΔʹ. XXIV.

1   ΚΑΙ Ἀβραὰμ ἦν πρεσβύτερος, προβεβηκὼς ἡμερῶν· καὶ Κύ-
2   ριος εὐλόγησε τὸν Ἀβραὰμ κατὰ πάντα. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἀβραὰμ τῷ
    παιδὶ αὐτοῦ τῷ πρεσβυτέρῳ τῆς οἰκίας αὐτοῦ, τῷ ἄρχοντι πάντων
3   τῶν αὐτοῦ· θὲς τὴν χεῖρά σου ὑπὸ τὸν μηρόν μου, καὶ ἐξορκιῶ
    σε Κύριον τὸν Θεὸν τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ τὸν Θεὸν τῆς γῆς, ἵνα μὴ
    λάβῃς γυναῖκα τῷ υἱῷ μου Ἰσαὰκ ἀπὸ τῶν θυγατέρων τῶν Χα-
4   ναναίων, μεθ᾿ ὧν ἐγὼ οἰκῶ ἐν αὐτοῖς· ἀλλὰ εἰς τὴν γῆν μου οὗ
    ἐγενόμην, πορεύσῃ, καὶ εἰς τὴν φυλήν μου, καὶ λήψῃ γυναῖκα τῷ
5   υἱῷ μου (Ἰσαὰκ) ἐκεῖθεν. Εἶπε δὲ πρὸς αὐτὸν ὁ παῖς· μήποτε
    οὐ βούλεται ἡ γυνὴ πορευθῆναι· μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ ὀπίσω εἰς τὴν γῆν
    ταύτην, ἀποστρέψω τὸν υἱόν σου εἰς τὴν γῆν, ὅθεν ἐξῆλθες ἐκεῖθεν.

**GENESIS CHAPTER 23**

^11 And the Hittite unto Abraham said, in the hearing of the sons of Heth
    and of all them that came into the gate of his city, saying:
    "Be thou my lord, and hearken unto me.
    The field, and the cave which is therein,
    I give thee; before my citizens have I given it unto thee;
    bury thou thy dead."

^12 And Abraham bowed himself low before the people of the land,

^13 and he spake unto Ephron in the ears (before) all the people of the land, saying:
    "Since thou art with me, hearken unto me;
    the silver for the field, take it of me, and I shall bury my dead there."

^14 Then Ephron answered Abraham, saying:

^15 "Nay, my lord; for I have heard [the worth thereof]:
    a field of four hundred didrachmas of silver,
    what then shall this be between me and thee?
    Bury thou, therefore, thy dead."

^16 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron,
    and Abraham restored unto Ephron the silver,
    which he had spoken of in the ears of the sons of Heth,
    four hundred didrachmas of silver, approved for merchants.

^17 And the field of Ephron, which was in the double cave,
    which is before Mamre,
    even the field and the cave which was therein,
    and every tree which was in the field, which is in all its borders round about,

^18 was made sure unto Abraham for a possession,
    in the presence of the sons of Heth
    and of all them that went into the gate of the city.

^19 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife
    in the cave of the field, the double one,
    which is opposite Mamre: this is Hebron in the land of Canaan.

^20 And the field and the cave which was therein,
    were confirmed unto Abraham for a possession of burial,
    from the sons of Heth.

**CHAPTER 24**

^1 AND Abraham was old, and well stricken in days;
    and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things.

^2 And Abraham said unto his servant, the elder of his house,
    who was the steward over all that he had:

^3 "Put now thy hand under my thigh,
    and I will make thee swear by the Lord,
    the God of heaven and the God of the earth,
    that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son Isaac
    from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell;

^4 but thou shalt go unto my land, whence I came,
    and unto my kindred, and take a wife for my son (Isaac) from thence."

^5 And the servant said unto him:
    "Perchance the woman will not be willing
    to come with me hither, back unto this land;
    shall I then cause thy son to return
    unto the land from whence thou camest?"
