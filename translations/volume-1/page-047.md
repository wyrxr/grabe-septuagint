**GENESIS**

**CHAPTER 21**

1 And the Lord visited Sarah, as He had said; and the Lord did unto Sarah according as He had spoken.
2 For Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the appointed time, as the Lord had spoken unto him.
3 And Abraham called the name of his son who was born unto him, whom Sarah bore him, Isaac.
4 And Abraham circumcised Isaac his son on the eighth day, as God had commanded him.
5 Now Abraham was one hundred years old when Isaac his son was born unto him.
6 And Sarah said, "The Lord hath made a laughter for me; for whosoever shall hear [of it], will rejoice with me."
7 And she said, "Who will declare unto Abraham that Sarah suckleth a child? For I have borne a son in mine old age."
8 And the child grew, and was weaned; and Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac his son was weaned.
9 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, who was born unto Abraham, playing with Isaac her own son.
10 Wherefore she said unto Abraham, "Cast out this bondwoman and her son; for the son of this bondwoman shall not inherit with my son, [even] with Isaac."
11 And the word appeared very grievous in the sight of Abraham because of his son Ishmael.
12 And God said unto Abraham, "Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the child, and because of the bondwoman. In all that Sarah saith unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
13 And as for the son of this bondwoman, I will also make him a great nation, because he is thy seed."
14 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a skin of water, and gave [them] unto Hagar; and he placed [the provisions] upon her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away. And she departed, and wandered in the wilderness by the well of the oath.
15 And the water ran out from the skin; and she cast the child underneath one fir tree.
16 And she went, and sat down over against him at a further distance, as it were a bowshot; for she said, "Let me not see the death of my child." And she sat over against him (from afar); and the child having cried aloud, wept.
17 And God heard the voice of the child from the place where he was; and the Angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, "What aileth thee, Hagar? Fear not; for God hath heard the voice of thy child from the place where he is.
18 Rise up, and take the child, and hold him in thine hand; for a great nation will I make of him."

1 Καὶ Κύριος ἐπεσκέψατο τὴν Σάρραν, καθὰ εἶπε· καὶ ἐποίησε
2 Κύριος τῇ Σάρρᾳ καθὰ ἐλάλησε. Καὶ συλλαβοῦσα, ἔτεκε Σάρρα
τῷ ᾿Αβραὰμ υἱὸν εἰς τὸ γῆρας, εἰς τὸν καιρόν, καθὰ ἐλάλησεν
3 αὐτῷ Κύριος. Καὶ ἐκάλεσεν ᾿Αβραὰμ τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ
4 τοῦ γενομένου αὐτῷ, ὃν ἔτεκεν αὐτῷ Σάρρα, Ἰσαάκ. Περιέτεμε
δὲ ᾿Αβραὰμ τὸν Ἰσαὰκ υἱὸν αὐτοῦ τῇ ὀγδόῃ ἡμέρᾳ, καθὰ ἐνετεί-
5 λατο αὐτῷ ὁ Θεός. ᾿Αβραὰμ δὲ ἦν ἑκατὸν ἐτῶν, ἡνίκα ἐγένετο
6 αὐτῷ Ἰσαὰκ ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ. Εἶπε δὲ Σάρρα· γελωτά μοι ἐποίησε
7 Κύριος· ὃς γὰρ ἐὰν ἀκούσῃ, συγχαρεῖταί μοι. Καὶ εἶπε· τίς ἀναγ-
γελεῖ τῷ ᾿Αβραάμ, ὅτι θηλάζει παιδίον Σάρρα; ὅτι ἔτεκον υἱὸν
8 ἐν τῷ γήρει μου. Καὶ ηὐξήθη τὸ παιδίον, καὶ ἀπεγαλακτίσθη· καὶ
ἐποίησεν ᾿Αβραὰμ δοχὴν μεγάλην, ᾗ ἡμέρᾳ ἀπεγαλακτίσθη Ἰσαὰκ
9 ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ. Ἰδοῦσα δὲ Σάρρα τὸν υἱὸν Ἄγαρ τῆς Αἰγυπτίας,
ὃς ἐγένετο τῷ ᾿Αβραὰμ παίζοντα μετὰ Ἰσαὰκ τοῦ υἱοῦ ἑαυτῆς,
10 καὶ εἶπε τῷ ᾿Αβραάμ· ἔκβαλε τὴν παιδίσκην ταύτην, καὶ τὸν υἱὸν
αὐτῆς· οὐ γὰρ μὴ κληρονομήσει ὁ υἱὸς τῆς παιδίσκης ταύτης με-
11 τὰ τοῦ υἱοῦ μου Ἰσαάκ. Σκληρὸν δὲ ἐφάνη τὸ ῥῆμα σφόδρα ἐναν-
12 τίον ᾿Αβραὰμ περὶ τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ Ἰσμαήλ. Εἶπε δὲ ὁ Θεὸς τῷ
᾿Αβραάμ· μὴ σκληρὸν ἔστω τὸ ῥῆμα ἐναντίον σου περὶ τοῦ παιδίου,
καὶ περὶ τῆς παιδίσκης· πάντα ὅσα ἐὰν εἴπῃ σοι Σάρρα, ἄκουε τῆς
13 φωνῆς αὐτῆς, ὅτι ἐν Ἰσαὰκ κληθήσεταί σοι σπέρμα. Καὶ τὸν υἱὸν
δὲ τῆς παιδίσκης ταύτης εἰς ἔθνος μέγα ποιήσω αὐτόν, ὅτι σπέρ-
14 μα σόν ἐστιν. ᾿Ανέστη δὲ ᾿Αβραὰμ τὸ πρωΐ, καὶ ἔλαβεν ἄρτους
καὶ ἀσκὸν ὕδατος, καὶ ἔδωκε τῇ Ἄγαρ· καὶ ἐπέθηκεν ἐπὶ τὸν
ὤμον αὐτῆς καὶ τὸ παιδίον, καὶ ἀπέστειλεν αὐτήν. ᾿Απελθοῦσα δὲ
15 ἐπλανᾶτο κατὰ τὴν ἔρημον, κατὰ τὸ φρέαρ τοῦ ὅρκου. Ἐξέλιπε
δὲ τὸ ὕδωρ ἐκ τοῦ ἀσκοῦ· καὶ ἔῤῥιψε τὸ παιδίον ὑποκάτω μιᾶς
16 ἐλάτης. ᾿Απελθοῦσα δὲ ἐκάθητο ἀπέναντι αὐτοῦ μακρότερον, ὡσεὶ
τόξου βολήν· εἶπε γάρ· οὐ μὴ ἴδω τὸν θάνατον τοῦ παιδίου μου·
καὶ ἐκάθητο ἀπέναντι αὐτοῦ (μακρόθεν)· ἀναβοῆσαν δὲ τὸ παιδίον
17 ἔκλαυσεν. Εἰσήκουσεν δὲ ὁ Θεὸς τῆς φωνῆς τοῦ παιδίου ἐκ τοῦ
τόπου οὗ ἦν· καὶ ἐκάλεσεν ἄγγελος Θεοῦ τὴν Ἄγαρ ἐκ τοῦ οὐ-
ρανοῦ, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ· τί ἐστιν Ἄγαρ; μὴ φοβοῦ· ἐπακήκοε γὰρ
18 ὁ Θεὸς τῆς φωνῆς τοῦ παιδίου σου ἐκ τοῦ τόπου οὗ ἐστιν. Ἀνά-
