τοῖς· μὴ φοβεῖσθε, ἐγὼ διαθρέψω ὑμᾶς καὶ τὰς οἰκίας ὑμῶν· καὶ
παρεκάλεσεν αὐτούς, καὶ ἐλάλησεν αὐτῶν εἰς τὴν καρδίαν. Καὶ κα- 22
τῴκησεν Ἰωσὴφ εἰς Αἴγυπτον αὐτὸς καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ
πᾶσα ἡ πανοικία τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἔζησεν Ἰωσὴφ ἔτη ἑκα-
τὸν δέκα. Καὶ εἶδεν Ἰωσὴφ Ἐφραΐμ παιδία, ἕως τρίτης γενεᾶς· 23
καὶ υἱοὶ Μαχεὶρ τοῦ υἱοῦ Μανασσῆ ἐτέχθησαν ἐπὶ μηρῶν Ἰωσήφ.
Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰωσὴφ τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς αὐτοῦ· ἐγὼ ἀποθνήσκω· ἐπισκο- 24
πῇ δὲ ἐπισκέψεται ὁ Θεὸς ὑμᾶς, καὶ ἀνάξει ὑμᾶς ἐκ τῆς γῆς
ταύτης εἰς τὴν γῆν, ἣν ὤμοσεν ὁ Θεὸς Ἀβραάμ, καὶ Ἰσαάκ, καὶ
Ἰακώβ. Καὶ ὥρκισεν Ἰωσὴφ τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ, λέγων· ἐν τῇ 25
ἐπισκοπῇ (ᾗ) ἐπισκέψεται ὁ Θεὸς ὑμᾶς, καὶ συνανοίσετε τὰ ὀστᾶ
μου ἐντεῦθεν μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν. Καὶ ἐτελεύτησεν Ἰωσήφ, ἐτῶν ἑκατὸν δέκα· 26
καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτόν, καὶ ἔθηκαν αὐτὸν ἐν τῇ σορῷ ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ.

**GENESIS 50**

21 Then [he said] to them: "Fear ye not, for I shall nourish you and your households."
And he comforted them, and spoke into their heart.

22 And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he and his brethren, and all the household of his father;
and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years.

23 And Joseph saw the children of Ephraim, even unto the third generation;
and the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh were born upon Joseph's thighs.

24 And Joseph said unto his brethren: "I die; but God shall surely visit you,
and shall bring you up out of this land unto the land which God swore to Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob."

25 And Joseph made the children of Israel swear, saying:
"In the visitation (in which) God shall visit you, ye shall carry up my bones from hence with you."

26 And Joseph died, being a hundred and ten years old;
and they buried him, and they laid him in a coffin in Egypt.
