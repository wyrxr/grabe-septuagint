Here is the translation of the provided Greek text:

### Genesis Chapter 22

2 "Behold, I am [here]." And He said, "Take thy son, thy beloved [son], whom thou hast loved, Isaac, and go forth unto the high land, and offer him up there as a burnt offering upon one of the mountains, whichsoever I shall tell thee."
3 And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his ass; and he took with him two young men, and Isaac his son; and splitting wood for the burnt offering, he arose and went forth, and came
4 unto the place which God had told him, on the third day. And Abraham, lifting up his eyes, beheld the place from
5 afar. And Abraham said unto his young men, "Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the child will go yonder, and having worshipped,
6 we shall return unto you." And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took in his hand the fire also, and the knife, and
7 they both went together. And Isaac spoke unto Abraham his father, saying, "My father." And he said, "What is it, my son?" And he said, "Behold the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?"
8 And Abraham said, "God Himself shall see to the lamb for a burnt offering, my son."
9 And they both went on together, and came unto the place which God had told him; and Abraham built there an altar, and laid the wood [upon it]; and having bound Isaac his
10 son, he laid him upon the altar, upon the wood. And Abraham stretched forth his hand to take the knife, to slay
11 his son. And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said [unto him], "Abraham, Abraham!" And he said, "Behold, I
12 am [here]." And he said, "Lay not thine hand upon the child, neither do thou anything unto him; for now I know that thou fearest God, and
13 hast not spared thy beloved son for My sake." And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a ram caught in a Sabek bush by its horns; and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of Isaac
14 his son. And Abraham called the name of that place, "The Lord has seen"; so that they may say this day: "In the mount, the Lord appeared."
15 And the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham a second time out of
16 heaven, saying, "By Myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, because thou hast done this thing, and hast not spared thy beloved
17 son for My sake, I will surely bless thee, and I will greatly multiply
