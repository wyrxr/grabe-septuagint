καὶ τὸν οἶκον Μααλλών· καὶ (εἰ μὴ) ἐξέλθοι πῦρ ἀπὸ ἀνδρῶν Σι-
κίμων, καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ οἴκου Μααλλών, καὶ καταφάγοι τὸν Ἀβιμέ-
λεχ. Καὶ ἀπέδρα Ἰωάθαμ, καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἐν ἐδῶ, καὶ ἔφυγεν εἰς 21
‘Ῥαρά’ καὶ κατώκησεν ἐκεῖ ἀπὸ προσώπου Ἀβιμέλεχ τοῦ ἀδελ-
φοῦ αὐτοῦ. 22 Καὶ ἦρξεν Ἀβιμέλεχ ἐν Ἰσραὴλ τρία ἔτη. Καὶ 23
ἐξαπέστειλεν ὁ Θεὸς πνεῦμα πονηρὸν ἀναμέσον Ἀβιμέλεχ καὶ
ἀναμέσον τῶν ἀνδρῶν Σικίμων, καὶ ἠθέτησαν οἱ **ἄνδρες** Σικίμων
ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ Ἀβιμέλεχ, τοῦ ἐπαγαγεῖν τὴν ἀδικίαν τῶν ἑβδομή- 24
κοντα υἱῶν Ἱεροβάαλ, καὶ τὸ αἷμα αὐτῶν ἐπιθεῖναι ἐπὶ Ἀβιμέ-
λεχ τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτῶν τὸν ἀποκτείναντα αὐτούς, καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς
ἄνδρας Σικίμων τοὺς κατισχύσαντας χεῖρας αὐτοῦ, ὥστε ἀπο-
κτεῖναι τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἔθεντο αὐτῷ οἱ ἄνδρες Σικίμων 25
ἔνεδρα ἐπὶ τὰς κεφαλὰς τῶν ὀρέων, καὶ ἀνήρπαζον πάντας τοὺς
διαπορευομένους ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς ἐν τῇ ἐδῶ· καὶ ἀπηγγέλη τῷ Ἀβι-
μέλεχ. Καὶ ἦλθε Γαὰλ υἱὸς Ἀβὲδ καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ πα- 26
ρῆλθον εἰς Σίκιμα· καὶ ἐπεποίθησαν αὐτῷ οἱ ἄνδρες Σικίμων. Καὶ 27
ἦλθον εἰς ἀγρόν, καὶ ἐτρύγησαν τοὺς ἀμπελῶνας αὐτῶν, καὶ κα-
τεπάτουν, καὶ ἐποίησαν χορούς· καὶ εἰσῆλθον εἰς οἶκον θεοῦ αὐτῶν
καὶ ἔφαγον καὶ ἔπιον, καὶ κατηρῶντο τὸν Ἀβιμέλεχ. Καὶ εἶπε 28
Γαὰλ υἱὸς Ἀβέδ· τίς ἐστιν Ἀβιμέλεχ, καὶ τίς ἐστιν ὁ υἱὸς Συχέμ,
ἔτι δουλεύσομεν αὐτῷ; οὐχ οὗτος υἱὸς Ἱεροβάαλ, καὶ Ζεβοὺλ ἐπί-
σκοπος αὐτοῦ δοῦλος αὐτοῦ σὺν τοῖς ἀνδράσιν Ἐμμὼρ πατρὸς Συ-
χέμ; καὶ τί ὅτι δουλεύσομεν αὐτῷ ἡμεῖς; Καὶ τίς **δῴη** τὸν λαὸν 29
τοῦτον ἐν χειρί μου; καὶ μεταστήσω τὸν Ἀβιμέλεχ· καὶ ἐρῶ τῷ Ἀβιμέ-
λεχ, πλήθυνον τὴν δύναμίν σου, καὶ ἔξελθε. Καὶ ἤκουσε Ζεβοὺλ ἄρχων 30
τῆς πόλεως τοὺς λόγους Γααλιοῦ υἱοῦ Ἀβέδ, καὶ ἐθυμώθη ὀργῇ. Καὶ ἀπέ- 31
στειλεν ἀγγέλους πρὸς Ἀβιμέλεχ μετὰ δώρων, λέγων Ἰδοὺ Γαὰλ υἱὸς
Ἀβὲδ καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ παραγεγόνασιν εἰς Σίκιμα, καὶ οἱ δὲ
πολιορκοῦσι τὴν πόλιν ἐπί σε. Καὶ νῦν ἀνάστηθι νυκτός, σὺ καὶ ὁ 32
λαὸς ὁ μετὰ σοῦ, καὶ ἐνέδρευσον ἐν τῷ ἀγρῷ. Καὶ ἔσται **τὸ πρωΐ** 33
ἅμα τῷ ἀνατεῖλαι τὸν ἥλιον, καὶ ὀρθρίσεις, καὶ ἐκτενεῖς ἐπὶ τὴν
πόλιν· καὶ ἰδοὺ αὐτὸς καὶ ὁ λαὸς ὁ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, ἐκπορεύονται
πρός σε, καὶ ποιήσεις αὐτῷ, καθάπερ ἐὰν εὕρῃ ἡ χείρ σου. Καὶ 34
ἀνέστη Ἀβιμέλεχ καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ὁ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ νυκτός, καὶ ἐν-

**CHAPTER 9.**

**20.** and the house of Millo. And if not, let fire come forth from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech.

**21.** And Jotham fled, and went into this region, and he escaped unto Rara, and dwelt there because of Abimelech his brother.

**22.** And Abimelech reigned over Israel for three years.

**23.** And God sent an evil spirit betwixt Abimelech and betwixt the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with the house of Abimelech,

**24.** that the injustice done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood might be laid upon Abimelech their brother, who slew them, and upon the men of Shechem, who strengthened his hands, to slay his brethren.

**25.** And the men of Shechem set ambushes for him upon the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all them that passed by them in this region; and it was told unto Abimelech.

**26.** And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and they passed over unto Shechem; and the men of Shechem put their trust in him.

**27.** And they went out into the field, and gathered their vineyards, and trod [the grapes], and made merry with dancing; and they entered into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.

**28.** And Gaal the son of Ebed said, "Who is Abimelech, and who is the son of Shechem, that we should yet serve him? Is not this man the son of Jerubbaal? And is Zebul his overseer, his servant with the men of Emmor, the father of Shechem? And why should we serve him?"

**29.** And who would give this people into my hand? Then would I remove Abimelech! And I would say to Abimelech, "Increase thy power, and come forth!"

**30.** And Zebul, the ruler of the city, heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, and his wrath was greatly kindled.

**31.** And he sent messengers unto Abimelech with gifts, saying, "Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren are come unto Shechem, and behold, they do besiege the city against thee.

**32.** Now therefore, rise up by night, thou and the people that are with thee, and lay an ambush in the field.

**33.** And it shall be in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, that thou shalt rise early, and stretch out against the city; and behold, he and the people that are with him shall come out against thee, and thou shalt do unto him according as thine hand shall find."

**34.** And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by night, and they laid in wait against Shechem, divided into four companies.

**35.** And it came to pass in the morning, that Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the [city].
