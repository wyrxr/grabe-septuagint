ΚΕΦ ΚΕ΄. ΑΕΥΙΤΙΚΟΝ 221
πλησίον, κατὰ ἀριθμὸν ἐνιαυτῶν γεννημάτων ἀποδώσεταί σοι. Καθό- 16
τι ἂν πλεῖον τῶν ἐτῶν πληθύνῃ τὴν ἔγκτησιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ καθότι
ἂν ἔλαττον τῶν ἐτῶν ἐλαττονώσῃ τὴν κτῆσιν αὐτοῦ, ὅτι ἀριθμὸν
γεννημάτων (αὐτοῦ) οὗτος ἀποδώσεταί σοι. Μὴ θλιβέτω ἄνθρωπος 17
τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ, καὶ φοβηθήσῃ (Κύριον) τὸν Θεόν σου· ὅτι ἐγὼ
(εἰμι) Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν. Καὶ ποιήσετε πάντα τὰ δικαιώματά 18
μου, καὶ πάσας τὰς κρίσεις μου, καὶ φυλάξασθε, καὶ ποιήσατε αὐ-
τάς, καὶ κατοικήσετε ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς πεποιθότες· καὶ δώσει ἡ γῆ τὰ 19
ἐκφόρια αὐτῆς, καὶ φάγεσθε εἰς πλησμονήν, καὶ κατοικήσετε πε-
ποιθότες ἐπ᾽ αὐτῆς. Ἐὰν δὲ λέγητε· τί φαγόμεθα ἐν τῷ ἔτει τῷ 20
ἑβδόμῳ (τούτῳ), ἐὰν μὴ σπείρωμεν, μηδὲ συναγάγωμεν τὰ γεννή-
ματα ἡμῶν ; καὶ ἀποστελῶ τὴν εὐλογίαν μου ὑμῖν ἐν τῷ ἔτει 21
τῷ ἔκτῳ, καὶ ποιήσει τὰ γεννήματα αὐτῆς εἰς τὰ τρία ἔτη· καὶ 22
σπερεῖτε τὸ ἔτος τὸ ὄγδοον, καὶ φάγεσθε ἀπὸ τῶν γεννημάτων πα-
λαιὰ ἕως τοῦ ἔτους τοῦ ἐννάτου· ἕως ἂν ἔλθῃ τὸ γέννημα αὐτῆς
φάγεσθε παλαιὰ παλαιῶν. Καὶ ἡ γῆ οὐ πραθήσεται εἰς βεβαίω- 23
σιν· ἐμὴ γάρ ἐστιν ἡ γῆ, διότι προσήλυτοι καὶ πάροικοι ὑμεῖς ἐστε
ἐναντίον μου· καὶ κατὰ πᾶσαν γῆν κατασχέσεως ὑμῶν, λύτρα 24
δώσετε τῆς γῆς. Ἐὰν δὲ πένεται ὁ ἀδελφός σου ὁ μετὰ σοῦ, καὶ 25
ἀποδώσεται ἀπὸ τῆς κατασχέσεως αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔλθῃ ὁ ἀγχιστεύων
αὐτὸ (ἐγγίζων) ἔγγιστα αὐτοῦ, καὶ λυτρώσεται τὴν πρᾶσιν τοῦ
ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ. Ἐὰν δὲ μὴ ᾖ τινι ὁ ἀγχιστεύων καὶ εὑρεθῇ τῇ 26
χειρὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ εὑρεθῇ αὐτῷ τὸ ἱκανὸν λύτρα αὐτοῦ, καὶ συλ- 27
λογεῖται τὰ ἔτη τῆς πράσεως αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀποδώσει ὃ ὑπερέχει τῷ ἀν-
θρώπῳ, ᾧ ἀπέδοτο (αὐτὸν) αὐτῷ, καὶ ἀπελεύσεται εἰς τὴν κατάσχεσιν
αὐτοῦ. Ἐὰν δὲ μὴ εὑρεθῇ ἡ χεὶρ αὐτοῦ τὸ ἱκανὸν, ὥστε ἀποδοῦναι 28
αὐτῷ, καὶ ἔσται ἡ πρᾶσις αὐτοῦ τῷ κτησαμένῳ αὐτὰ ἕως τοῦ (ἔκτου) ἔτους
τῆς ἀφέσεως, καὶ ἐξελεύσεται ἐν τῇ ἀφέσει, καὶ ἀπελεύσεται εἰς τὴν
κατάσχεσιν αὐτοῦ. Ἐὰν δέ τις ἀποδῶται οἰκίαν οἰκητὴν ἐν πόλει 29
τετειχισμένην, καὶ ἔσται ἡ λύτρωσις αὐτῆς, ἕως πληρωθῇ· ἐνιαυτὸς
ἡμερῶν ἔσται ἡ λύτρωσις αὐτῆς. Ἐὰν δὲ μὴ λυτρωθῇ ἕως ἂν πληρωθῇ 30
αὐτῇ ἐνιαυτὸς ὅλος, κυρωθήσεται ἡ οἰκία ἡ οὖσα ἐν πόλει τῇ ἐχούσῃ
τεῖχος βεβαίως τῷ κτησαμένῳ αὐτὴν εἰς τὰς γενεὰς αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐκ
ἐξελεύσεται ἐν τῇ ἀφέσει. Αἱ δὲ οἰκίαι αἱ ἐν ἐπαύλεσιν, αἷς οὐκ 31
ἔστιν αὐταῖς τεῖχος κύκλῳ πρὸς τὸν ἀγρὸν τῆς γῆς λογισθήτωσαν·
λυτρωταὶ δι᾽ ἀπαντὸς ἔσονται αὗται· καὶ ἐν τῇ ἀφέσει ἐξελεύσονται.

### English Translation

#### Chapter 25

16 According as he shall multiply the years of his acquisition, and according as he shall diminish the years of his possession, [so] shall he restore unto thee the number of its produce, ([even] *of it*).
17 No man shall oppress his neighbour; but thou shalt fear [the Lord] thy God, for I [am] the Lord your God.
18 And ye shall keep all My statutes, and all My judgments, and observe them, and do them; and ye shall dwell upon the land in security.
19 And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat to the full, and ye shall dwell upon it in security.
20 And if ye shall say, What shall we eat in the seventh year, [even] this [year], if we sow not, nor gather in our produce?
21 Then I will send My blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall yield its produce for three years.
22 And ye shall sow in the eighth year, and ye shall eat of the old produce until the ninth year; until its produce come, ye shall eat of the old, of old [produce].
23 And the land shall not be sold in perpetuity; for the land is Mine, because ye are sojourners and tenants before Me.
24 And throughout all the land of your possession, ye shall grant a redemption for the land.
25 And if thy brother, that dwelleth with thee, be impoverished, and shall sell some of his possession; and his kinsman-redeemer, (he that draweth nigh), who is nearest unto him, shall come, then shall he redeem the sale of his brother.
26 But if a man have no kinsman-redeemer, and [the means] be found in his hand, and there be found unto him sufficient for his redemption,
27 Then he shall calculate the years of his sale, and shall restore that which remaineth unto the man to whom he sold [him], even unto him; and he shall return unto his possession.
28 But if his hand find not sufficient to restore unto him, then his sale shall remain with him that acquired it until the (sixth) year of release; and it shall go forth in the release, and he shall return unto his possession.
29 And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then the right of its redemption shall endure until it be fulfilled: a full year of days shall be its redemption.
30 But if it be not redeemed until a whole year be fulfilled for it, then the house that is in the city which hath a wall shall be confirmed unto him that acquired it throughout his generations, and it shall not go forth in the release.
31 But the houses which are in unwalled villages, which have no wall round about them, shall be accounted as the fields of the land; they shall be redeemable at all times, and they shall go forth in the release.
