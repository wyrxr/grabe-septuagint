ΚΕΦ. ΙΕ΄. ΕΞΟΔΟΣ 123
δεδοξασμένος ἐν ἁγίοις, θαυμαστὸς ἐν δόξαις, ποιῶν τέρατα. Ἐξέτεινας 12
τὴν δεξιάν σου, καὶ κατέπιεν αὐτοὺς ἡ γῆ. Ὡδήγησας ἐν τῇ δι- 13
καιοσύνῃ σου τὸν λαόν σου τοῦτον, ὃν ἐλυτρώσω˙ παρεκάλεσας ἐν
τῇ ἰσχύϊ σου εἰς κατάλυμα ἅγιόν σου. Ἤκουσαν ἔθνη, καὶ ἐφο- 14
βήθησαν ὠδῖνες ἔλαβον κατοικοῦντας Φυλιστιείμ. Τότε ἔσπευσαν 15
ἡγεμόνες Ἐδώμ, καὶ ἄρχοντες Μωαβιτῶν, ἔλαβεν αὐτοὺς τρόμος˙
ἐτάκησαν πάντες οἱ κατοικοῦντες Χαναάν. Ἐπιπέσοι ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς 16
φόβος καὶ τρόμος μεγέθει βραχίονός σου˙ ἀπολιθωθήτωσαν, ἕως
ἂν παρέλθῃ ὁ λαός σου Κύριε, ἕως ἂν παρέλθῃ ὁ λαός σου οὗ-
τος, ὃν ἐκτήσω. Εἰσαγαγὼν καταφύτευσον αὐτοὺς εἰς ὄρος κλη- 17
ρονομίας σου, εἰς ἕτοιμον κατοικητήριόν σου, ὃ κατειργάσω Κύ-
ριε, ἁγίασμα Κύριε, ὃ ἡτοίμασαι αἱ χεῖρές σου. Κύριος βασι- 18
λεύων τῶν αἰώνων, καὶ ἐπ᾿ αἰῶνα, καὶ ἔτι. Ὅτι εἰσῆλθεν ἵππος 19
Φαραὼ σὺν ἅρματι καὶ ἀναβάταις αὐτοῦ εἰς θάλασσαν, καὶ ἐπή-
γαγε Κύριος ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς τὸ ὕδωρ τῆς θαλάσσης˙ οἱ δὲ υἱοὶ Ἰσ-
ραὴλ ἐπορεύθησαν διὰ ξηρᾶς ἐν μέσῳ τῆς θαλάσσης. Ἔλαβε δὲ 20
Μαριάμ ἡ προφῆτις ἡ ἀδελφὴ Ἀαρὼν τὸ τύμπανον ἐν τῇ χειρὶ
αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐξῆλθον πᾶσαι αἱ γυναῖκες ὀπίσω αὐτῆς μετὰ τυμπά-
νων καὶ χορῶν. Ἐξῆρχε δὲ αὐτῶν Μαριάμ, λέγουσα˙ ᾄσωμεν 21
τῷ Κυρίῳ, ἐνδόξως γὰρ δεδόξασται˙ ἵππον καὶ ἀναβάτην ἔρριψεν
εἰς θάλασσαν. Ἔξῆρε δὲ Μωυσῆς τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ ἀπὸ θαλάσ- 22
σης ἐρυθρᾶς, καὶ ἤγαγεν αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν ἔρημον Σούρ˙ καὶ ἐπο-
ρεύοντο τρεῖς ἡμέρας ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, καὶ οὐχ ηὕρισκον ὕδωρ, ὥστε
πιεῖν. Ἦλθον δὲ εἰς Μεῤῥᾶ, καὶ οὐκ ἐδύναντο πιεῖν ὕδωρ ἐκ 23
Μεῤῥᾶς, πικρὸν γὰρ ἦν˙ διὰ τοῦτο ἐπωνομάσθη τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ τό-
που ἐκείνου, Πικρία. Καὶ διεγόγγυζεν ὁ λαὸς κατὰ Μωυσῆ, λέ- 24
γοντες˙ τί πιόμεθα; Ἐβόησε δὲ Μωυσῆς πρὸς Κύριον˙ καὶ ἔδειξεν 25
αὐτῷ Κύριος ξύλον, καὶ ἐνέβαλεν αὐτὸ εἰς τὸ ὕδωρ, καὶ ἐγλυ-
κάνθη τὸ ὕδωρ. Ἐκεῖ ἔθετο αὐτῷ δικαιώματα καὶ κρίσεις, καὶ ἐκεῖ
ἐπείραζεν αὐτόν. Καὶ εἶπεν˙ ἐὰν ἀκοῇ ἀκούσῃς τῆς φωνῆς Κυρίου 26
τοῦ Θεοῦ σου, καὶ τὰ ἀρεστὰ ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ ποιήσῃς, καὶ ἐπο-
τήσῃ ταῖς ἐντολαῖς αὐτοῦ, καὶ φυλάξῃς πάντα τὰ δικαιώματα αὐ-
τοῦ, πᾶσαν νόσον ἣν ἐπήγαγον τοῖς Αἰγυπτίοις, οὐκ ἐπάξω ἐπὶ
σέ˙ ἐγὼ γάρ εἰμι Κύριος ὁ ἰώμενός σε. Καὶ ἦλθον εἰς Αἰλείμ 27
καὶ ἦσαν ἐκεῖ δώδεκα πηγαὶ ὑδάτων, καὶ ἑβδομήκοντα στελέχη
φοινίκων˙ προσενέβαλον δὲ ἐκεῖ παρὰ τὰ ὕδατα.

### Exodus Chapter 15

**11** Glorified in holiness, awesome in His splendours, performing wonders.
**12** Thou didst stretch forth Thy right hand, and the earth swallowed them.
**13** Thou hast guided in Thy righteousness this people whom Thou didst redeem; Thou didst lead them forth by Thy strength unto Thy holy dwelling place.
**14** The nations have heard, and they were sore afraid; pangs seized the inhabitants of Philistia.
**15** Then were the chiefs of Edom dismayed, and the princes of Moabites; trembling seized them. All the inhabitants of Canaan melted away.
**16** May fear and terror fall upon them, by the greatness of Thine arm; may they be turned to stone, until Thy people pass over, O Lord, until this Thy people pass over, whom Thou hast acquired.
**17** Thou shalt bring them in and plant them in the mountain of Thine inheritance, in Thy ready dwelling place, which Thou, O Lord, hast wrought; a sanctuary, O Lord, which Thou hast prepared, [even] Thy hands.
**18** The Lord shall reign unto the ages, and for ever, and yet more!

**19** For when the horse of Pharaoh, with his chariots and his horsemen, entered into the sea, then the Lord brought upon them the water of the sea; but the children of Israel walked through the dry [land] in the midst of the sea.
**20** And Mariam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.
**21** And Mariam led them, saying, "Let us sing to the Lord, for He hath been glorified gloriously; the horse and its rider He hath cast into the sea!"

**22** And Moses led forth the children of Israel from the Red Sea, and brought them into the Wilderness of Sur; and they journeyed for three days in the wilderness, yet found no water to drink.
**23** And they came to Marah, but they could not drink water from Marah, for it was bitter. Therefore was the name of that place called Bitterness.
**24** And the people murmured against Moses, saying, "What shall we drink?"
**25** Then Moses cried unto the Lord; and the Lord showed him a tree, and he cast it into the water, and the water was made sweet. There He set for them ordinances and judgments, and there He proved him.
**26** And He said, "If thou wilt surely hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God, and shalt do that which is pleasing before Him, and shalt attend unto His commandments, and shalt keep all His ordinances, every disease which I brought upon the Egyptians, I will not bring upon thee; for I am the Lord thy Healer."
**27** And they came to Elim, and there were there twelve wells of water, and seventy palm trees; and they encamped there by the waters.
