σεις αὐτοῖς τὸν ἁγνισμὸν αὐτῶν· περιῤῥανεῖς αὐτοὺς ὕδωρ ἁγνισμοῦ,
καὶ ἐπελεύσεται ξυρὸν ἐπὶ πᾶν τὸ σῶμα αὐτῶν, καὶ πλυνοῦσι τὰ
ἱμάτια αὐτῶν, καὶ καθαροὶ ἔσονται. Καὶ λήψονται μόσχον ἕνα ἐκ 8
βοῶν, καὶ τούτου θυσίαν σεμίδαλιν ἀναπεποιημένην ἐν ἐλαίῳ, καὶ
μόσχον ἐνιαύσιον ἐκ βοῶν λήψῃ περὶ ἁμαρτίας. Καὶ προσάξεις 9
τοὺς Λευΐτας ἔναντι τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου, καὶ συνάξεις πᾶσαν
συναγωγὴν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ· καὶ προσάξεις τοὺς Λευΐτας ἔναντι Κυρίου, 10
καὶ ἐπιθήσουσιν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τοὺς Λευΐτας.
Καὶ ἀφοριεῖ Ἀαρὼν τοὺς Λευΐτας ἀπόδομα ἔναντι Κυρίου παρὰ τῶν 11
υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἔσονται ὥστε ἐργάζεσθαι τὰ ἔργα Κυρίου. Οἱ 12
δὲ Λευΐται ἐπιθήσουσι τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τὰς κεφαλὰς τῶν
μόσχων· καὶ ποιήσει τὸν ἕνα περὶ ἁμαρτίας, καὶ τὸν ἕνα εἰς
ὁλοκαύτωμα Κυρίῳ, ἐξιλάσασθαι περὶ αὐτῶν. Καὶ στήσεις τοὺς 13
Λευΐτας ἔναντι Κυρίου, καὶ ἔναντι Ἀαρών, καὶ ἔναντι τῶν υἱῶν
αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀποδώσεις αὐτοὺς ἀπόδομα Κυρίῳ. Καὶ διαστελεῖς τοὺς 14
Λευΐτας ἐκ μέσου υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἔσονται ἐμοί. Καὶ μετὰ 15
ταῦτα εἰσελεύσονται οἱ Λευΐται ἐργάζεσθαι τὰ ἔργα τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ
μαρτυρίου· καὶ καθαριεῖς αὐτούς, καὶ ἀποδώσεις αὐτοὺς ἔναντι
Κυρίου. Ὅτι ἀπόδομα ἀποδεδομένα οὗτοί μοι εἰσὶν ἐκ μέσου υἱῶν 16
Ἰσραὴλ· ἀντὶ τῶν διανοιγόντων πᾶσαν μήτραν πρωτοτόκων πάντων
ἐκ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, εἴληφα αὐτοὺς ἐμοί. Ὅτι ἐμοὶ πᾶν πρωτότοκον 17
ἐξ υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ ἀπὸ ἀνθρώπου ἕως κτήνους· ᾗ ἡμέρᾳ ἐπάταξα
πᾶν πρωτότοκον ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ , ἡγίασα αὐτοὺς ἐμοί· καὶ ἔλαβον 18
τοὺς Λευΐτας ἀντὶ παντὸς πρωτοτόκου ἐν υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἀπέδωκα 19
τοὺς Λευΐτας ἀπόδομα δεδομένους Ἀαρὼν καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ
ἐκ μέσου υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, ἐργάζεσθαι τὰ ἔργα τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ ἐν
τῇ σκηνῇ τοῦ μαρτυρίου, καὶ ἐξιλάσκεσθαι περὶ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ·
καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ἐν τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραὴλ πληγή, προσεγγιζόντων υἱῶν
Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς τὰ ἅγια. Καὶ ἐποίησε Μωυσῆς καὶ Ἀαρὼν καὶ πᾶσα 20
συναγωγὴ υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ τοῖς Λευΐταις· καθὰ ἐνετείλατο Κύριος τῷ
Μωυσῇ περὶ τῶν Λευϊτῶν, οὕτως ἐποίησαν αὐτοῖς οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ.
Καὶ ἡγνίσαντο οἱ Λευΐται, καὶ ἔπλυναν τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτῶν· καὶ 21
ἀπέδωκεν αὐτοὺς Ἀαρών, ἀπόδομα ἔναντι Κυρίου, καὶ ἐξιλάσατο
περὶ αὐτῶν Ἀαρών, ἀφαγνίσασθαι αὐτούς. Καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα εἰσῆλθον 22
οἱ Λευΐται λειτουργεῖν τὴν λειτουργίαν αὐτῶν ἐν

**Chapter 8**

7 ye shall perform for them their purification. Ye shall sprinkle them with water of cleansing, and a razor shall pass over all their body, and they shall wash their garments, and so shall they be made clean.
8 And they shall take one bullock from the herd, and its meal offering [shall be] fine flour commingled with oil. And a young bullock of one year from the herd shalt thou take for a sin offering.
9 And thou shalt bring the Levites before the Tabernacle of Witness, and thou shalt gather all the congregation of the children of Israel.
10 And thou shalt bring the Levites before the Lord, and the children of Israel shall lay their hands upon the Levites.
11 And Aaron shall offer the Levites, a wave offering, before the Lord, from among the children of Israel, that they may execute the service of the Lord.
12 And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks; and he shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering unto the Lord, to make propitiation for them.
13 And thou shalt set the Levites before the Lord, and before Aaron, and before his sons, and thou shalt offer them as a wave offering unto the Lord.
14 And thou shalt separate the Levites from the midst of the children of Israel, and they shall be Mine.
15 And after these things the Levites shall come in to perform the service of the Tabernacle of Witness; and thou shalt purify them, and thou shalt offer them before the Lord.
16 For they are given unto Me as a dedicated offering from among the children of Israel; in place of all that open every womb, even all the firstborn of the children of Israel, have I taken them unto Myself.
17 For every firstborn among the children of Israel is Mine, both of man and of beast: on the day that I smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I sanctified them unto Myself.
18 And I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel.
19 And I have given the Levites as an offering dedicated unto Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to perform the service of the children of Israel in the Tabernacle of Witness, and to make propitiation for the children of Israel; and there shall be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel draw nigh unto the holy things.
20 And Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the children of Israel did unto the Levites; according as the Lord commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did the children of Israel unto them.
21 And the Levites purified themselves, and washed their garments; and Aaron offered them, a wave offering, before the Lord, and Aaron made propitiation for them, to purify them.
22 And after these things the Levites entered in to perform their service in
