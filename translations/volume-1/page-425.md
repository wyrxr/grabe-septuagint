1   ΚΑΙ ἐξῆλθεν ὁ κλῆρος ὁ δεύτερος τῷ Συμεὼν, τῇ φυλῇ υἱῶν
Συμεὼν κατὰ δήμους αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐγενήθη ἡ κληρονομία αὐτῶν ἀνα-
2 μεσον κλήρου υἱῶν Ἰούδα. Καὶ ἐγενήθη αὐτοῖς ὁ κλῆρος αὐτῶν·
3 Βηρσαβεὲ, καὶ Σαβεὲ, καὶ Μωλαδὰ, καὶ Ἀσερσουὰλ, καὶ Βαθοὺλ,
4 καὶ Βελβωλὰ, καὶ Ἀσὼμ, καὶ Ἐλθουλὰδ, καὶ Ἑρμὰ, 5 καὶ Σεκελὰγ,
6 καὶ Βαιθαμαργαβαθὼ, καὶ Ἀσερσουσὶμ, καὶ Βαιθλεβαὼ, καὶ αἱ
7 ἀγροὶ αὐτῶν· πόλεις δεκατρεῖς καὶ αἱ κῶμαι αὐτῶν. Ἄϊν, καὶ
Ῥεμμὼ, καὶ Ἐσθὲρ, καὶ Ἀσάμ· πόλεις τέσσαρες καὶ αἱ κῶμαι
8 αὐτῶν· καὶ πᾶσαι αἱ ἐπαύλεις αἱ περικύκλῳ τῶν πόλεων τούτων
ἕως Βααλαθεὴρ-ῥαμὼθ πορευομένων Ἰαμὲθ κατὰ λίβα. Αὕτη ἡ
9 κληρονομία φυλῆς υἱῶν Συμεὼν κατὰ κλήρους αὐτῶν. Ἀπὸ τοῦ
κλήρου τῶν υἱῶν Ἰούδα ἡ κληρονομία φυλῆς υἱῶν Συμεὼν ὅτι
ἐγενήθη μερὶς υἱῶν Ἰούδα μείζων τῆς αὐτῶν καὶ ἐκληρονόμησαν
10 υἱοὶ Συμεὼν ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ κλήρου αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ὁ κλῆρος
ὁ τρίτος τῷ Ζαβουλὼν κατὰ δήμους αὐτῶν· καὶ ἔσται τὰ ὅρια τῆς
11 κληρονομίας αὐτῶν ἕως Σαρείδ· καὶ προσαναβαίνει τὰ ὅρια αὐτῶν
ἡ θάλασσα καὶ Μαριλὰ, καὶ συνάγει ἐπὶ Δαβασαθὼ, καὶ ἀπαντήσει
12 εἰς τὴν φάραγγα, ἥ ἐστι κατὰ πρόσωπον Ἰεκνάμ· καὶ ἀναστρέψει
ἀπὸ Σαρείδ ἐξ ἐναντίας ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν Σαμεὲς ἐπὶ τὰ ὅρια Χασα-
λωθ-Θαβὼρ, καὶ διελεύσεται ἐπὶ τὰ ὅρια Δαβρὰθ, καὶ προσαναβή-
13 σεται ἐπὶ Ἰαργαΐ· καὶ ἐκεῖθεν περιελεύσεται ἐξ ἐναντίας ἐπὶ ἀνα-
τολὰς ἐπὶ Γαιθὰθ-Ἑφὲρ, ἐπὶ πόλιν Κασὶν, καὶ διελεύσεται ἐπὶ
14 Ῥεμμωνὰμ Μαθραὰμ Ἀννουά· καὶ περιελεύσεται (ἐπὶ) τὰ ὅρια ἐπὶ
βορρᾶ ἐπὶ Ἐνναθὼθ, καὶ ἔσται ἡ διέξοδος αὐτῶν ἐπὶ Γαῖ Ἰεφθαηλ.
15 καὶ Καττὰθ, καὶ Νααλὼλ, καὶ Σεμρὼν, καὶ Ἰαδηλὰ, καὶ Βαιθλεὲμ·
16 πόλεις δώδεκα καὶ αἱ κῶμαι αὐτῶν. Αὕτη ἡ κληρονομία τῆς φυλῆς
υἱῶν Ζαβουλὼν κατὰ δήμους αὐτῶν, αἱ πόλεις αὗται, καὶ αἱ κῶμαι
17 αὐτῶν. Καὶ τῷ Ἰσσάχαρ ἐξῆλθεν ὁ κλῆρος ὁ τέταρτος, τοῖς υἱοῖς
18 Ἰσσάχαρ κατὰ συγγενείας αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐγενήθη τὰ ὅρια αὐτῶν
19 Ἰεζραὴλ, καὶ Ἀγαλειλὼθ, καὶ Σουνὰμ, καὶ Ἀφερεεὶμ, καὶ Σειὼν,

**Joshua 18**

<sup>28</sup> and Gabaol, and the city of Jearim: thirteen cities, with their villages. This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families.

**Joshua 19**

<sup>1</sup> And the second lot came forth for Simeon, even for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families; and their inheritance came to be amidst the inheritance of the children of Judah.
<sup>2</sup> And their lot was unto them:
<sup>3</sup> Beersheba, and Sheba, and Moladah, and Asersual, and Bethul,
<sup>4</sup> and Belbolah, and Asom, and Elthulad, and Herma,

<sup>7</sup> Ain, and Remmo, and Esther, and Asam: four cities, with their villages.
<sup>8</sup> And all the folds that are round about these cities, even unto Baalatheer-ramoth, [unto the region of] those who journey to Jameth southward. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon, according to their lots.
<sup>9</sup> From the lot of the children of Judah did the tribe of the children of Simeon receive their inheritance; for the portion of the children of Judah proved too great for them, and so the children of Simeon inherited within the midst of their [Judah's] inheritance.

<sup>10</sup> And the third lot came forth for Zebulun, even for the children of Zebulun according to their families; and the boundary of their inheritance shall extend unto Sarid:
<sup>11</sup> And their boundary ascendeth toward the sea and Maralah, and reacheth unto Dabashath, and it shall meet the valley which is over against Jokneam.
<sup>12</sup> And it shall turn back from Sarid eastward, opposite Shama, unto the boundary of Chasloth-Tabor; and it shall pass unto the boundary of Dabrath, and it shall ascend unto Japhia;
<sup>13</sup> and from thence it shall pass around eastward, opposite Gath-Hepher, unto the city of Kasin; and it shall pass unto
<sup>14</sup> Rimmonah-Mathraam-Annoua; and it shall go about [unto] the boundary northward unto Hannathon; and the going forth thereof shall be unto the Valley of Iphtahel.
<sup>15</sup> And Kattath, and Nahalol, and Shimron, and Idalah, and Bethlehem:
<sup>16</sup> twelve cities, with their villages. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Zebulun according to their families: these cities, and their villages.

<sup>17</sup> And for Issachar came forth the fourth lot, even for the children of Issachar according to their kindreds.
<sup>18</sup> And their boundary came to be:
<sup>19</sup> Jezrael, and Agaleiloth, and Sunam, and Aphareim, and Seion,
<sup>20</sup> ([and] Rhene), and Anachreeth, and Rabthoth, and Keison, and Aimes,
