9 κερατίναις. Τῷ δὲ λαῷ ἐνετείλατο Ἰησοῦς, λέγων· μὴ βοάτω,
καὶ μὴ ἀκουσάτω μηθεὶς τὴν φωνὴν ὑμῶν, καὶ οὐ διελεύσεται ἐκ
στόματος ὑμῶν λόγος, ἕως ἂν ἡμέραν διαγγείλῃ αὐτὸς ὑμῖν ἀνα-
10 βοῆσαι, καὶ τότε ἀναβοήσατε. Καὶ περιελθοῦσα ἡ κιβωτὸς τῆς
διαθήκης τοῦ Θεοῦ τὴν πόλιν κύκλῳ, εὐθέως ἀπῆλθεν εἰς τὴν πα-
11 ρεμβολήν, καὶ ἐκοιμήθη ἐκεῖ. Καὶ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ δευτέρᾳ ἀνέστη
12 Ἰησοῦς τὸ πρωΐ, καὶ ἦραν οἱ ἱερεῖς τὴν κιβωτὸν Κυρίου. Καὶ οἱ
ἱερεῖς οἱ ἑπτὰ αἴροντες τὰς ἑπτὰ σάλπιγγας ἱεράς, προεπορεύον-
το ἐναντίον κιβωτοῦ τοῦ Κυρίου, καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς ἐσάλπισαν ταῖς
σάλπιγξι, (καὶ ὁ λοιπὸς ὄχλος ἅπας)· καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα εἰσεπο-
ρεύοντο οἱ μάχιμοι, καὶ ὁ λοιπὸς ὄχλος ὄπισθεν τῆς κιβωτοῦ τῆς
διαθήκης Κυρίου, πορευόμενοι καὶ σαλπίζοντες ταῖς κερατίναις.
13 Καὶ περιεκύκλωσαν τὴν πόλιν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ δευτέρᾳ ἅπαξ ἐγ-
γύθεν, καὶ ἀπῆλθον πάλιν εἰς τὴν παρεμβολήν· οὕτως ἐποίει ἐπὶ
14 ἓξ ἡμέρας. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ ἀνέστησαν ἐν τῇ ἀνα-
βάσει τοῦ ὄρθρου, καὶ περιῆλθον τὴν πόλιν κατὰ τὸ κρῖμα τοῦτο
ἑπτάκις· πλὴν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἐκύκλωσαν τὴν πόλιν ἑπτάκις.
15 Καὶ ἐγένετο τῇ περιόδῳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ ἐσάλπισαν οἱ ἱερεῖς ταῖς σάλ-
πιγξι· καὶ εἶπεν Ἰησοῦς τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ· κεκράξατε, παραδέ-
16 δωκε γὰρ Κύριος ὑμῖν τὴν πόλιν· καὶ ἔσται ἡ πόλις ἀνάθεμα,
αὐτὴ καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐστὶν ἐν αὐτῇ, τῷ Κυρίῳ τῶν δυνάμεων· πλὴν
Ῥαὰβ τὴν πόρνην περιποιήσασθε, αὐτὴν καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐστὶν ἐν
τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτῆς· ὅτι ἔκρυψε τοὺς ἀγγέλους οὓς ἀπεστείλαμεν.
17 Ἀλλὰ ὑμεῖς φυλάξασθε ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀναθέματος, μήποτε ἐνθυμηθέντες
ὑμεῖς λάβητε ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀναθέματος, καὶ ποιήσητε τὴν παρεμβολὴν
18 τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ ἀνάθεμα, καὶ ἐκτρίψητε ἡμᾶς. Καὶ πᾶν ἀργύ-
ριον καὶ χρυσίον, καὶ πᾶς χαλκός, καὶ σίδηρος ἅγιον ἔσται τῷ
19 Κυρίῳ· εἰς θησαυρὸν Κυρίου εἰσενεχθήσεται. Καὶ ἠλάλαξεν ὁ λα-
ός, καὶ ἐσάλπισαν ταῖς σάλπιγξιν οἱ ἱερεῖς. Ὡς δὲ ἤκουσεν ὁ λαὸς
τὴν φωνὴν τῶν σαλπίγγων, ἠλάλαξε πᾶς ὁ λαὸς (ἅμα) ἀλαλαγ-
μῷ μεγάλῳ καὶ ἰσχυρῷ. Καὶ ἔπεσε τὸ τεῖχος κύκλῳ· καὶ ἀνέ-
βη πᾶς ὁ λαὸς εἰς τὴν πόλιν, ἕκαστος ἐξεναντίας αὐτοῦ, καὶ κα-
20 τελάβοντο τὴν πόλιν. Καὶ ἀνεθεμάτισαν αὐτήν, καὶ ὅσα ἦν ἐν τῇ
πόλει ἀπὸ ἀνδρὸς καὶ ἕως γυναικός, ἀπὸ νεανίσκου καὶ ἕως πρε-
σβυτέρου, καὶ ἕως μόσχου καὶ (ἕως) προβάτου καὶ ὑποζυγίου ἐν
21 στόματι ῥομφαίας. Καὶ τοῖς δύο νεανίσκοις τοῖς κατασκοπεύσασι

**Joshua 6**
9 ...with ram's horns. And Joshua commanded the people, saying, "Ye shall not shout,
neither shall any man hear your voice, nor shall a word proceed from your mouth, until the day
when He himself shall proclaim unto you to shout; and then shall ye shout."
10 And the ark of the covenant of God, having gone about the city in a circuit,
straightway departed into the camp, and lodged there.
11 And on the second day Joshua rose up early in the morning;
12 and the priests took up the ark of the Lord. And the seven priests,
bearing the seven holy trumpets, went on before the ark of the Lord;
and the priests sounded with the trumpets, (yea, and all the rest of the host);
and after these came the men of war, and the rest of the host
behind the ark of the covenant of the Lord, marching and sounding with the ram's horns.
13 And they encompassed the city on the second day once near by,
and departed again into the camp; thus did he for six days.
14 And it came to pass on the seventh day that they rose up at the dawning of the morning,
and went round about the city after this manner seven times;
howbeit on that day they encompassed the city seven times.
15 And it came to pass at the seventh circuit, the priests sounded with the trumpets;
and Joshua said unto the children of Israel, "Shout ye, for the Lord
16 hath delivered unto you the city. And the city shall be a devoted thing,
it and all that is therein, unto the Lord of hosts;
save ye Rahab the harlot, her and all that is in her house,
because she hid the messengers whom we sent.
17 But as for you, beware of the devoted thing, lest ye, giving thought to it,
take from the devoted thing, and so make the camp
18 of the children of Israel a devoted thing, and utterly destroy us.
And all silver and gold, and all bronze, and iron,
it shall be holy unto the Lord; into the treasury of the Lord shall it be brought."
19 And the people shouted, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.
And when the people heard the sound of the trumpets,
all the people shouted (together) with a great and mighty shout.
And the wall fell down round about; and all the people went up into the city,
every man straight before him, and they took the city.
20 And they devoted it to destruction, and all that was in the city,
from man even unto woman, from young man even unto elder,
and unto calf and [unto] sheep and beast of burden, with the edge of the sword.
21 And Joshua said unto the two young men who had spied out the land,
