**Deuteronomy 6:24-25**
24 Καὶ πάντα τὰ δικαιώματα ταῦτα, φοβεῖσθαι Κύριον τὸν Θεὸν ἡμῶν, ἵνα εὖ ᾖ ἡμῖν πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας, ἵνα ζῶμεν, ὥσπερ καὶ σήμερον. 25 Καὶ ἐλεημοσύνη ἔσται ἡμῖν, ἐὰν φυλασσώμεθα ποιεῖν πάσας τὰς ἐντολὰς ταύτας ἔναντι Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν, καθὰ ἐνετείλατο ἡμῖν.

**Deuteronomy 7:1-10**
1 ΚΑΙ ἔσται ἐν τῷ εἰσαγαγεῖν σε Κύριον τὸν Θεόν σου εἰς τὴν γῆν, εἰς ἣν εἰσπορεύῃ ἐκεῖ, κληρονομῆσαι αὐτήν, καὶ ἐξάρῃ ἔθνη μεγάλα καὶ πολλὰ ἀπὸ προσώπου σου, τὸν Χετταῖον καὶ τὸν Γεργεσαῖον καὶ τὸν ᾿Αμοῤῥαῖον καὶ Χαναναῖον καὶ Φερεζαῖον καὶ Εὐαῖον καὶ τὸν ᾿Ιεβουσαῖον, ἑπτὰ ἔθνη μεγάλα καὶ πολλὰ 2 καὶ ἰσχυρότερα ὑμῶν, καὶ παραδώσει αὐτοὺς Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου εἰς τὰς χεῖράς σου, καὶ πατάξεις αὐτοὺς, ἀφανισμῷ ἀφανιεῖς αὐτοὺς· οὐ διαθήσῃ πρὸς αὐτοὺς διαθήκην, οὐδὲ μὴ ἐλεήσῃς αὐτούς. 3 Οὐδὲ μὴ γαμβρεύσῃτε πρὸς αὐτούς· τὴν θυγατέρα σου οὐ δώσεις τῷ υἱῷ αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὴν θυγατέρα αὐτοῦ οὐ λήψῃ τῷ υἱῷ σου. 4 ᾿Αποστήσει γὰρ τὸν υἱόν σου ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ, καὶ λατρεύσει θεοῖς ἑτέροις· καὶ ὀργισθήσεται θυμῷ Κύριος εἰς ὑμᾶς, καὶ ἐξολεθρεύσει σε τοτάχος. 5 ᾿Αλλ᾿ οὕτως ποιήσετε αὐτοῖς· τοὺς βωμοὺς αὐτῶν καθελεῖτε, καὶ τὰς στήλας αὐτῶν συντρίψετε, καὶ τὰ ἄλση αὐτῶν ἐκκόψετε, καὶ τὰ γλυπτὰ τῶν θεῶν αὐτῶν κατακαύσετε πυρί· 6 ὅτι λαὸς ἅγιος εἶ Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ σου, καὶ σὲ προείλατο Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου, εἶναι αὐτῷ λαὸν περιούσιον παρὰ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη, ὅσα ἐπὶ προσώπου τῆς γῆς. 7 Οὐχ ὅτι πολυπληθεῖτε παρὰ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη, προείλατο Κύριος ὑμᾶς, καὶ ἐξελέξατο ὑμᾶς· ὑμεῖς γὰρ ἐστε ὀλιγοστοὶ παρὰ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη· 8 ἀλλὰ παρὰ τὸ ἀγαπᾷν Κύριον ὑμᾶς, διατηρῶν τὸν ὅρκον, ὃν ὤμοσε τοῖς πατράσιν ὑμῶν, ἐξήγαγε Κύριος ὑμᾶς (ἐκεῖθεν) ἐν χειρὶ κραταιᾷ καὶ ἐν βραχίονι ὑψηλῷ, καὶ ἐλυτρώσατό σε ἐξ οἴκου δουλείας, ἐκ χειρὸς Φαραὼ βασιλέως Αἰγύπτου. 9 Καὶ γνώσῃ, ὅτι Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου, οὗτος Θεός, ὁ Θεός ὁ πιστὸς, ὁ φυλάσσων τὴν διαθήκην καὶ τὸ ἔλεος τοῖς ἀγαπῶσιν αὐτὸν καὶ τοῖς φυλάσσουσι τὰς ἐντολὰς αὐτοῦ εἰς χιλίας γενεάς· 10 καὶ ἀποδιδοὺς τοῖς μισοῦσιν αὐτὸν κατὰ πρόσωπον, ἐξολοθρεύσαι αὐτοὺς, καὶ οὐχὶ βραδυνεῖ τοῖς μισοῦσι,

**Deuteronomy 6**

24 And all these righteous statutes, [He hath given unto us] to fear the Lord our God, to the end that it might be well with us all our days, and that we might live, even as [we live] this day. 25 And it shall be accounted unto us for righteousness, if we be careful to perform all these commandments before the Lord our God, even as He hath commanded us.

**Deuteronomy 7**

1 And it shall come to pass, when the Lord thy God shall bring thee into the land, whither thou goest there to possess it; and He shall cast out great and many nations from before thy face: the Hittite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite; seven nations, great and many, and stronger than ye; 2 And the Lord thy God shall deliver them into thy hand, and thou shalt smite them, [yea], with utter destruction shalt thou utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, neither shalt thou show them mercy. 3 Neither shalt thou intermarry with them; thy daughter shalt thou not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son. 4 For he shall turn thy son from following Me, that he may serve other gods; and the Lord's wrath shall be kindled against you, and He shall destroy thee swiftly. 5 But thus shall ye do unto them: ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and cut down their groves, and burn with fire the graven images of their gods. 6 For a holy people art thou unto the Lord thy God; and thee hath the Lord thy God chosen to be unto Him a peculiar people above all the nations, even as many as are upon the face of the earth. 7 Not that ye are more in multitude than all the nations, did the Lord choose you, and select you; for ye are the fewest of all peoples. 8 But because the Lord doth love you, and because He hath kept the oath which He swore unto your fathers, therefore the Lord brought you out [from thence] with a mighty hand and with a high arm, and redeemed thee out of the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh, king of Egypt. 9 Know therefore that the Lord thy God, He is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love Him and keep His commandments unto a thousand generations. 10 And repaying them that hate Him to their face, [even] to destroy them; and He will not delay unto those that hate Him,
