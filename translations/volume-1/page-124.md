τράποσι, καὶ ἐν πάσῃ γῇ Αἰγύπτου. Ἐξέτεινεν οὖν Ἀαρὼν τῇ 17
χειρὶ τὴν ῥάβδον, καὶ ἐπάταξε τὸ χῶμα τῆς γῆς· καὶ ἐγένοντο
οἱ σκνῖφες ἔν τε τοῖς ἀνθρώποις, καὶ ἐν τοῖς τετράποσι, καὶ ἐν παντὶ
χώματι τῆς γῆς ἐγένοντο οἱ σκνῖφες ἐν πάσῃ γῇ Αἰγύπτου.
Ἐποίησαν δὲ ὡσαύτως καὶ οἱ ἐπαοιδοὶ ταῖς φαρμακίαις αὐτῶν, 18
ἐξαγαγεῖν τὸν σκνίφα, καὶ οὐκ ἠδύναντο· καὶ ἐγένοντο οἱ σκνῖφες
ἐν τοῖς ἀνθρώποις, καὶ ἐν τοῖς τετράποσιν. Εἶπαν οὖν οἱ ἐπαοιδοὶ 19
τῷ Φαραώ· δάκτυλος Θεοῦ ἐστι τοῦτο· καὶ ἐσκληρύνθη ἡ καρδία
Φαραώ, καὶ οὐκ εἰσήκουσεν αὐτῶν, καθάπερ ἐλάλησε Κύριος.
Εἶπε δὲ Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν· ὄρθρισον τὸ πρωΐ, καὶ στῆθι ἐναντίον 20
Φαραώ· ἰδοὺ αὐτὸς ἐκπορεύεται ἐπὶ τὸ ὕδωρ, καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς
αὐτόν· τάδε λέγει Κύριος· ἐξαπόστειλον τὸν λαόν μου, ἵνα μοι λατρεύσωσιν
ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ. Ἐὰν δὲ μὴ βούλῃ ἐξαποστεῖλαι τὸν λαόν 21
μου, ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐξαποστέλλω ἐπὶ σέ, καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς θεράποντάς σου,
καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν λαόν σου, καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς οἴκους ὑμῶν κυνόμυιαν, καὶ
πλησθήσονται αἱ οἰκίαι τῶν Αἰγυπτίων τῆς κυνόμυιας, καὶ εἰς τὴν
γῆν ἐφ᾿ ἧς εἰσιν ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς. Καὶ παραδοξάσω ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ τὴν 22
γῆν Γεσέν, ἐφ᾿ ἧς ὁ λαός μου ἔπεστιν ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς, ἐφ᾿ ἧς οὐκ ἔσται
ἐκεῖ ἡ κυνόμυια· ἵνα εἰδῇς, ὅτι ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς πάσης τῆς γῆς.
Καὶ δώσω διαστολὴν ἀνὰ μέσον τοῦ ἐμοῦ λαοῦ, καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον τοῦ σοῦ 23
λαοῦ· ἐν δὲ τῇ αὔριον ἔσται τὸ σημεῖον τοῦτο ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς. Ἐποίησε
δὲ Κύριος οὕτω· καὶ παρεγένετο ἡ κυνόμυια πλῆθος εἰς τοὺς οἴκους 24
Φαραὼ καὶ εἰς τοὺς οἴκους τῶν θεραπόντων αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἰς πᾶσαν γῆν
Αἰγύπτου, καὶ ἐξωλοθρεύθη ἡ γῆ ἀπὸ τῆς κυνόμυιας. Ἐκάλεσε δὲ 25
Φαραὼ Μωυσῆν καὶ Ἀαρών, λέγων· ἐλθόντες θύσατε Κυρίῳ τῷ
Θεῷ ὑμῶν ἐν τῇ γῇ. Καὶ εἶπε Μωυσῆς· οὐ δυνατὸν γενέσθαι οὕτω· 26
τὰ γὰρ βδελύγματα τῶν Αἰγυπτίων θύσομεν Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ
ἡμῶν. Ἐὰν γὰρ θύσωμεν τὰ βδελύγματα τῶν Αἰγυπτίων ἐναντίον
αὐτῶν, λιθοβοληθησόμεθα. Ὁδὸν τριῶν ἡμερῶν πορευσόμεθα εἰς 27
τὴν ἔρημον, καὶ θύσομεν Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ ἡμῶν, καθάπερ εἶπεν
ἡμῖν. Καὶ εἶπε Φαραώ· ἐγὼ ἐξαποστελῶ ὑμᾶς, καὶ θύσετε Κυρίῳ 28
τῷ Θεῷ ὑμῶν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, ἀλλ᾿ οὐ μακρὰν ἀποτένεσθε πορευθῆναι·
εὔξασθε οὖν περὶ ἐμοῦ πρὸς Κύριον. Εἶπε δὲ Μωυσῆς· 29
ὁ δὲ ἐγὼ ἐξελεύσομαι ἀπὸ σοῦ, καὶ εὔξομαι πρὸς τὸν Θεόν, καὶ
ἀπελεύσεται ἡ κυνόμυια ἀπὸ σοῦ, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν θεραπόντων σου, καὶ
ἀπὸ τοῦ λαοῦ σου αὔριον· μὴ προσθῇς ἔτι Φαραὼ ἀπατῆσαι, τοῦ

**Exodus, Chapter 8**

**17** And upon the beasts, and throughout all the land of Egypt.
Then Aaron stretched forth his hand with the rod,
and he smote the dust of the earth;
and there came forth gnats upon both man and beast,
and upon all the dust of the earth were gnats
throughout all the land of Egypt.

**18** And the sorcerers did in like manner with their enchantments,
to bring forth the gnats, but they could not;
and the gnats were upon men and upon beasts.

**19** Then the sorcerers said unto Pharaoh,
This is the finger of God.
But the heart of Pharaoh was hardened,
and he hearkened not unto them, as the Lord had spoken.

**20** And the Lord said unto Moses,
Rise up early in the morning,
and stand before Pharaoh;
behold, he goeth forth unto the water;
and thou shalt say unto him,
Thus saith the Lord:
Send forth My people, that they may serve Me in the wilderness.

**21** But if thou wilt not send forth My people,
behold, I will send upon thee, and upon thy servants,
and upon thy people, and upon your houses, the dog-fly;
and the houses of the Egyptians shall be filled with the dog-fly,
and the land wherein they are, upon it shall it be.

**22** And I will make wondrous in that day the land of Goshen,
upon which My people is dwelling, upon it;
upon which the dog-fly shall not be there;
that thou mayest know that I am the Lord God of all the earth.

**23** And I will make a division between My people and thy people.
By tomorrow this sign shall be upon the earth.

**24** And the Lord did so;
and there came a great multitude of the dog-fly
into the houses of Pharaoh and into the houses of his servants,
and into all the land of Egypt;
and the land was destroyed by reason of the dog-fly.

**25** And Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, saying,
Go ye, and sacrifice unto the Lord your God in the land.

**26** And Moses said, It is not possible that this be so;
for the abominations of the Egyptians shall we sacrifice unto the Lord our God.
For if we sacrifice the abominations of the Egyptians before their eyes,
surely we shall be stoned.

**27** A journey of three days will we take into the wilderness,
and we will sacrifice unto the Lord our God, as He hath commanded us.

**28** And Pharaoh said, I will send you forth,
and ye shall sacrifice unto the Lord your God in the wilderness;
but ye shall not go very far to journey.
Therefore, pray ye for me unto the Lord.

**29** And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee,
and I will pray unto the Lord,
and the dog-fly shall depart from thee, and from thy servants,
and from thy people tomorrow.
[But] let not Pharaoh continue again to deceive,
[by refusing] to send forth the people, to sacrifice unto the Lord.
