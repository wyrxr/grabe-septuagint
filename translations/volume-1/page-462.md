Καὶ γυναῖκες. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη Ἀβιμέλεχ εἰς Θαιβάς, καὶ περιεκά-
θισεν ἐπ᾽ αὐτήν, καὶ προκατελάβετο αὐτήν. Καὶ πύργος ἦν ὀχυρὸς
ἐν μέσῳ τῆς πόλεως· καὶ ἔφυγον ἐκεῖ πάντες οἱ ἄνδρες καὶ αἱ γυναῖ-
κες, καὶ πάντες οἱ ἡγούμενοι τῆς πόλεως, καὶ ἀπέκλεισαν ἐφ᾽ ἑαυ-
τούς, καὶ ἀνέβησαν ἐπὶ τὸ δῶμα τοῦ πύργου. Καὶ ἦλθεν Ἀβιμέ-
λεχ ἕως τοῦ πύργου καὶ ἐξεπολέμησαν αὐτόν· καὶ ἤγγισεν Ἀβι-
μέλεχ ἕως τῆς θύρας τοῦ πύργου, ἐμπρῆσαι αὐτὴν ἐν πυρί. Καὶ
ἔῤῥιψε γυνὴ μία κλάσμα μύλου ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν Ἀβιμέλεχ, καὶ
συνέθλασε τὸ κρανίον αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐβόησε τὸ τάχος πρὸς τὸ παι-
δάριον, τὸν αἴροντα τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· σπάσον τὴν
μάχαιράν σου, καὶ θανάτωσόν με, μήποτε εἴπωσιν, ὅτι γυνὴ ἀπέ-
κτεινεν αὐτόν. Καὶ ἐξεκέντησεν αὐτὸν τὸ παιδάριον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀπέ-
θανεν Ἀβιμέλεχ. Καὶ ἴδεν ἀνὴρ Ἰσραὴλ ὅτι ἀπέθανεν Ἀβιμέλεχ·
καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ἀνὴρ εἰς τὸν τόπον αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἀπέστρεψεν ὁ Θεὸς
τὴν κακίαν Ἀβιμέλεχ, ἣν ἐποίησε τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ, ἀποκτεῖναι τοὺς
ἑβδομήκοντα ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ. Καὶ πᾶσαν κακίαν ἀνδρῶν Σικίμων
ἀπέστρεψε Κύριος εἰς τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτῶν· καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ἐπ᾽ αὐ-
τοὺς ἡ κατάρα Ἰωάθαμ τοῦ υἱοῦ Ἰεροβάαλ.

ΚΕΦ. Ιʹ. Χ
Καὶ ἀνέστη μετὰ Ἀβιμέλεχ τοῦ σῶσαι τὸν Ἰσραήλ, Θωλὰ
υἱὸς Φουά, υἱὸς πατραδέλφου αὐτοῦ, ἀνὴρ Ἰσσάχαρ· καὶ αὐτὸς
κατώικει ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ ἐν ὄρει Ἐφραΐμ. Καὶ ἔκρινε τὸν Ἰσραὴλ
εἴκοσι καὶ τρία ἔτη, καὶ ἀπέθανε, καὶ ἐτάφη ἐν Σαμαρείᾳ. Καὶ
ἀνέστη μετ᾽ αὐτὸν Ἰαεὶρ ὁ Γαλαδίτης, καὶ ἔκρινε τὸν Ἰσραὴλ εἴ-
κοσι καὶ δύο ἔτη. Καὶ ἐγένοντο αὐτῷ τριάκοντα καὶ δύο υἱοί, ἐπι-
βεβηκότες ἐπὶ τριάκοντα καὶ δύο πώλους, καὶ τριάκοντα δύο πό-
λεις αὐτοῖς· καὶ ἐκάλεσεν αὐτὰς ἐπαύλεις Ἰαεὶρ ἕως τῆς ἡμέ-
ρας ταύτης, αἵ ἐστιν ἐν τῇ γῇ Γαλαάδ. Καὶ ἀπέθανεν Ἰαείρ, καὶ
ἐτάφη ἐν Καμών. Καὶ προσέθεντο οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ποιῆσαι τὸ πο-
νηρὸν ἔναντι Κυρίου, καὶ ἐλάτρευσαν ταῖς Βααλείμ, καὶ ταῖς Ἀ-
σταρώθ, καὶ τοῖς θεοῖς Σιδῶνος, καὶ τοῖς θεοῖς Συρίας, καὶ τοῖς
θεοῖς Μωάβ, καὶ τοῖς θεοῖς υἱῶν Ἀμμών, καὶ τοῖς θεοῖς τῶν
ἀλλοφύλων· καὶ ἐγκατέλιπον τὸν Κύριον, καὶ οὐκ ἐδούλευσαν αὐ-
τῷ. Καὶ ἐθυμώθη ὀργῇ Κύριος ἐν τῷ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἀπέδοτο αὐ-

### Judges Chapter 9

**50.** [—a thousand men] and women. And Abimelech went unto Thebez, and encamped against it, and took it.

**51.** But there was a strong tower in the midst of the city; and all the men and the women, even all the leaders of the city, fled thither, and shut themselves in, and ascended upon the roof of the tower.

**52.** And Abimelech came even unto the tower, and they fought against him; and Abimelech drew nigh unto the door of the tower, to set it ablaze with fire.

**53.** And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech's head, and crushed his skull.

**54.** And he cried with haste unto the lad that bore his armor, and said unto him, "Draw forth thy sword, and slay me, lest men should say, 'A woman slew him.'" And his lad pierced him through, and Abimelech died.

**55.** And when a man of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, then every man departed unto his place.

**56.** Thus God turned back the evil of Abimelech, which he had wrought upon his father, in slaying his seventy brethren.

**57.** And all the wickedness of the men of Shechem did the Lord turn back upon their own heads; and the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal came upon them.

### Judges Chapter 10

**1.** And after Abimelech there arose to save Israel, Tola the son of Puah, the son of his father's brother, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Samaria, in the hill country of Ephraim.

**2.** And he judged Israel for twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in Samaria.

**3.** And after him arose Jair the Gileadite, and judged Israel for twenty and two years.

**4.** And he had thirty and two sons, who rode upon thirty and two young asses, and they possessed thirty and two cities; and he called them the tent-villages of Jair unto this day, which are in the land of Gilead.

**5.** And Jair died, and was buried in Camon.

**6.** And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord, and served the Baalim, and the Ashtaroth, and the gods of Sidon, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines; and they forsook the Lord, and served Him not.

**7.** And the Lord was wroth with anger against Israel, and He delivered them up—
