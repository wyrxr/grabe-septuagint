πάσῃ συναγωγῇ υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ τῷ προσηλύτῳ (καὶ) τῷ προσπορευομένῳ πρὸς ὑμᾶς, ὅτι παντὶ τῷ λαῷ ἀκουσίον. Ἐὰν δὲ ψυχὴ μία ἁμάρτῃ ἀκουσίως, · προσάξει αἶγα μίαν ἐνιαυσίαν περὶ ἁμαρτίας· καὶ ἐξιλάσεται ὁ ἱερεὺς περὶ τῆς ψυχῆς τῆς ἀκουσιασθείσης καὶ ἁμαρτούσης ἀκουσίως ἔναντι Κυρίου, ἐξιλάσασθαι περὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀφεθήσεται αὐτῷ. Τῷ ἐγχωρίῳ ἐν υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ τῷ προσηλύτῳ τῷ προσκειμένῳ ἐν αὐτοῖς, νόμος εἷς ἔσται αὐτοῖς, ὃς ἂν ποιήσῃ ἀκουσίως. Καὶ ψυχὴ ἥτις ποιήσει ἐν χειρὶ ὑπερηφανίας ἀπὸ τῶν αὐτοχθόνων ἢ ἀπὸ τῶν προσηλύτων, τὸν Θεὸν οὗτος παροξύνει, καὶ ἐξολοθρευθήσεται ἡ ψυχὴ ἐκείνη ἐκ μέσου τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτῆς· ὅτι τὸ ῥῆμα Κυρίου ἐφαύλισε, καὶ τὰς ἐντολὰς αὐτοῦ διεσκέδασεν, ἐκτριψεῖ ἐκτριβήσεται ἡ ψυχὴ ἐκείνη· ἡ ἁμαρτία αὐτῆς ἐν αὐτῇ. Καὶ ἦσαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, καὶ εὗρον ἄνδρα συλλέγοντα ξύλα ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τοῦ σαββάτου· καὶ προσήγαγον αὐτὸν οἱ εὑρόντες αὐτὸν συλλέγοντα τὰ ξύλα πρὸς Μωυσῆν καὶ Ἀαρών, καὶ πρὸς πᾶσαν συναγωγὴν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἀπέθεντο αὐτὸν εἰς φυλακήν· οὐ γὰρ συνέκριναν, τί ποιήσωσιν αὐτῷ. Καὶ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, λέγων· θανάτῳ θανατοῦσθω ὁ ἄνθρωπος, λιθοβολήσατε αὐτὸν λίθοις πᾶσα ἡ συναγωγὴ ἔξω τῆς παρεμβολῆς. Καὶ ἐξήγαγον αὐτὸν πᾶσα ἡ συναγωγὴ ἔξω τῆς παρεμβολῆς, καὶ ἐλιθοβόλησαν αὐτὸν πᾶσα ἡ συναγωγὴ ἐν λίθοις (ἔξω τῆς παρεμβολῆς), καὶ ἀπέθανε, καθὰ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, λέγων· λάλησον τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτούς· καὶ ποιησάτωσαν ἑαυτοῖς κράσπεδα ἐπὶ τὰ πτερύγια τῶν ἱματίων αὐτῶν εἰς τὰς γενεὰς αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπιθήσετε ἐπὶ τὰ κράσπεδα τῶν πτερυγίων κλῶσμα ὑακίνθινον· καὶ ἔσται ὑμῖν ἐν τοῖς κρασπέδοις, καὶ ὄψεσθε αὐτὰ καὶ μνησθήσεσθε πασῶν τῶν ἐντολῶν Κυρίου, καὶ ποιήσητε αὐτὰς καὶ οὐ διαστραφήσεσθε ὀπίσω τῶν διανοιῶν ὑμῶν, καὶ ὀπίσω τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν ὑμῶν, ἐν οἷς ὑμεῖς ἐκπορνεύετε ὀπίσω αὐτῶν· ὅπως ἂν μνησθῆτε, καὶ ποιήσητε πάσας τὰς ἐντολάς μου, καὶ ἔσεσθε ἅγιοι τῷ Θεῷ ὑμῶν. Ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν, ὁ ἐξαγαγὼν ὑμᾶς ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, εἶναι ὑμῖν Θεός· ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν.

**Chapter XV**

26 Unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and unto the sojourner, (yea) unto him that sojourneth among you; for unto all the people [it is accounted as] an unintentional [sin].
27 And if a single soul shall sin unawares, then shall he bring a she-goat of a year old for a sin offering;
28 And the priest shall make atonement for the soul that hath sinned unintentionally and hath transgressed unawares before the Lord, to make atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him.
29 For the native among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them, one law shall there be unto them, for him that doeth aught unawares.
30 But the soul that doeth aught with a high hand, whether he be of the home-born or of the strangers, the Lord doth he provoke, and that soul shall be utterly cut off from the midst of his people.
31 Because he hath despised the word of the Lord, and hath broken His commandments, that soul shall be utterly, yea, utterly cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him.

32 And the children of Israel were in the wilderness, and they found a man gathering wood upon the sabbath day.
33 And they that found him gathering the wood brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation of the children of Israel.
34 And they put him in ward, for they knew not what to do unto him.
35 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, The man shall surely be put to death; all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.
36 And all the congregation brought him forth without the camp, and they stoned him with stones (even without the camp), and he died, as the Lord had commanded Moses.

37 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
38 Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them, that they make them fringes upon the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that ye put upon the fringe of the borders a thread of blue.
39 And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the Lord, and do them; and that ye turn not aside after your own thoughts, and after
40 your own eyes, wherein ye go a-whoring after them; that ye may remember, and do all My commandments, and be holy unto your God.
41 I am the Lord your God, Who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the Lord your God.
