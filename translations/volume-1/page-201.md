στολὰς τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἡγίασεν Ἀαρὼν καὶ τὰς
στολὰς αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰς στολὰς τῶν υἱῶν
31 αὐτοῦ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπε Μωυσῆς πρὸς Ἀαρών, καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς
αὐτοῦ· ἐφήσατε τὰ κρέα ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου ἐν
τόπῳ ἁγίῳ, καὶ ἐκεῖ φάγεσθε αὐτὰ καὶ τοὺς ἄρτους τοὺς ἐν τῷ
κανῷ τῆς τελειώσεως, ὃν τρόπον συντέτακταί μοι, λέγων· Ἀα-
32 ρῶν καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ φάγονται ταῦτα· καὶ τὸ καταλειφθὲν τῶν
χρεῶν καὶ τῶν ἄρτων ἐν πυρὶ κατακαυθήσεται. Καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς θύρας
τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου οὐκ ἐξελεύσεσθε ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας, ἕως
ἡμέρα πληρωθῇ, ἡμέρα τελειώσεως ὑμῶν· ἑπτὰ γὰρ ἡμέρας τε-
34 λειώσει τὰς χεῖρας ὑμῶν. Καθάπερ ἐποίησεν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ταύτῃ,
(ἢ) ἐνετείλατο Κύριος τοῦ ποιῆσαι, ὥστε ἐξιλάσασθαι περὶ ὑμῶν.
35 Καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν θύραν τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου καθήσεσθε ἑπτὰ ἡμέ-
ρας, ἡμέρας καὶ νύκτας, καὶ φυλάξεσθε τὰ φυλάγματα Κυρίου, ἵνα
36 μὴ ἀποθάνητε· οὕτω γὰρ ἐνετείλατό μοι Κύριος (ὁ Θεός). Καὶ
ἐποίησεν Ἀαρὼν καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ πάντας τοὺς λόγους, οὓς συ-
νέταξε Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ.

ΚΕΦ Θ΄. ΙΧ.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐγενήθη τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ὀγδόῃ ἐκάλεσε Μωυσῆς Ἀαρών,
2 καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὴν γερουσίαν Ἰσραήλ· καὶ εἶπε Μωυ-
σῆς πρὸς Ἀαρών· λάβε σεαυτῷ μοσχάριον ἐκ βοῶν περὶ ἁμαρ-
τίας, καὶ κριὸν εἰς ὁλοκαύτωμα ἄμωμα, καὶ προσένεγκε αὐτὰ
3 ἔναντι Κυρίου. Καὶ τῇ γερουσίᾳ Ἰσραὴλ λάλησον, λέγων· λάβετε
χίμαρον ἐξ αἰγῶν (ἕνα) περὶ ἁμαρτίας, καὶ μοσχάριον καὶ ἀμνὸν
4 εἰς ὁλοκάρπωσιν ἐνιαύσιον ἄμωμα, καὶ μόσχον καὶ κριὸν εἰς θυ-
σίαν σωτηρίου ἔναντι Κυρίου, καὶ σεμίδαλιν πεφυραμένην ἐν ἐλαίῳ·
5 ὅτι σήμερον ὀφθήσεται Κύριος ἐν ὑμῖν. Καὶ ἔλαβον, καθὼς ἐνε-
τείλατο Μωυσῆς ἀπέναντι τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου· καὶ προ-
6 σῆλθε πᾶσα συναγωγή, καὶ ἔστησαν ἔναντι Κυρίου. Καὶ εἶπε Μωυ-
σῆς· τοῦτο τὸ ῥῆμα, ὃ εἶπε Κύριος, ποιήσατε, καὶ ὀφθήσεται ἐν
7 ὑμῖν δόξα Κυρίου. Καὶ εἶπε Μωυσῆς τῷ Ἀαρών· πρόσελθε πρὸς
τὸ θυσιαστήριον, καὶ ποίησον τὸ περὶ τῆς ἁμαρτίας σου, καὶ τὸ
ὁλοκαύτωμά σου, καὶ ἐξίλασαι περὶ σεαυτοῦ καὶ τοῦ οἴκου σου·
καὶ ποίησον τὰ δῶρα τοῦ λαοῦ, καὶ ἐξίλασαι περὶ αὐτῶν, καθά-

**Leviticus 8**

30 the garments of his sons with him; and he sanctified Aaron and his garments, and his sons, and the garments of his sons with him.
31 And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto his sons, saying: Ye said the flesh in the court of the tabernacle of testimony, in a holy place, and there shall ye eat them, and the loaves that are in the basket of consecration, according as it was commanded me, saying: Aaron
32 and his sons shall eat these [things]; and that which is left of the debts and of the loaves shall be consumed by fire.
33 And from the door of the tabernacle of testimony shall ye not go out for seven days, until the day be fulfilled, the day of your consecration; for seven days shall he consecrate your hands.
34 According as he did on this day, (or) the Lord commanded to do, so that atonement might be made for you.
35 And at the door of the tabernacle of testimony shall ye sit for seven days, by day and by night; and ye shall keep the charge of the Lord, that ye die not; for so the Lord (God) commanded me.
36 And Aaron and his sons did all the words which the Lord commanded Moses.

**Chapter 9**

1 And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron,
2 and his sons, and the elders of Israel; and Moses spake unto Aaron: Take for thyself a calf from the herd for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt offering without blemish, and bring them
3 before the Lord. And unto the elders of Israel speak thou, saying: Take ye a he-goat from the goats (one) for a sin-offering, and a calf and a lamb,
4 for a one-year-old whole burnt offering without blemish, and a bullock and a ram for a sacrifice of salvation before the Lord, and fine flour kneaded with oil;
5 for today shall the Lord appear among you.
6 And they took, as Moses commanded, before the tabernacle of testimony; and all the congregation drew near, and stood before the Lord.
7 And Moses said unto Aaron: Draw near unto the altar, and offer thy sin-offering, and thy burnt offering, and make atonement for thyself and for thy house; and offer the gifts of the people, and make atonement for them, accor-
