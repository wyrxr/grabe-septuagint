αὐτοῦ τὸ ἐνύπνιον, καὶ εἶπεν· ἰδοὺ τὸ ἐνύπνιον ὃ ἠνυπνιάσθην, καὶ
**13.** ἰδοὺ μαζὶς ἄρτου κριθίνου κυλιομένη ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ Μαδιάμ,
καὶ ἦλθεν ἕως τῆς σκηνῆς Μαδιάμ, καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτήν, καὶ ἔπεσεν,
καὶ κατέστρεψεν αὐτὴν ἄνω, καὶ ἔπεσεν ἡ σκηνή. Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη ὁ
**14.** πλησίον αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπεν· οὐκ ἔστιν αὕτη ἀλλ’ ἢ ῥομφαία Γεδεὼν
υἱοῦ Ἰωὰς ἀνδρὸς Ἰσραήλ· παρέδωκε Κύριος ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ τὴν
Μαδιὰμ καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν παρεμβολήν. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἤκουσεν Γεδεὼν
**15.** τὴν διήγησιν τοῦ ἐνυπνίου καὶ τὴν σύγκρισιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ προσεκύνησε
Κύριον, καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν εἰς τὴν παρεμβολὴν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ εἶπεν· ἀνάστητε,
ὅτι παρέδωκε Κύριος ἐν χειρὶ ὑμῶν τὴν παρεμβολὴν Μαδιάμ.
**16.** Καὶ διεῖλε τοὺς τριακοσίους ἄνδρας τρεῖς ἀρχάς, καὶ ἔδωκε κερατίνας
ἐν χειρὶ πάντων, καὶ ὑδρίας κενάς, καὶ λαμπάδας ἐν μέσῳ τῶν ὑδρίων.
**17.** Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτούς· ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ ὄψεσθε, καὶ οὕτως ποιήσετε· καὶ ἰδοὺ
ἐγὼ εἰσπορεύσομαι ἐν μέσῳ τῆς παρεμβολῆς, καὶ ἔσται, ὡς ἐὰν ποιήσω,
οὕτως ποιήσετε. Καὶ σαλπιῶ ἐν τῇ κερατίνῃ ἐγὼ καὶ πάντες οἱ μετ᾿
**18.** ἐμοῦ, καὶ σαλπιεῖτε ταῖς κερατίναις καὶ ὑμεῖς κύκλῳ ὅλης τῆς
παρεμβολῆς, καὶ ἐρεῖτε· τῷ Κυρίῳ καὶ τῷ Γεδεών. Καὶ εἰσῆλθε Γεδεὼν
**19.** καὶ ἑκατὸν ἄνδρες οἱ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἐν μέρει τῆς παρεμβολῆς, ἀρχομένης
τῆς φυλακῆς τῆς μεσούσης· πλὴν ἐγέρσει ἤγειραν τοὺς φυλάσσοντες,
καὶ ἐσάλπισαν ἐν ταῖς κερατίναις, καὶ ἐξετίναξαν τὰς ὑδρίας τὰς ἐν ταῖς
χερσὶν αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐσάλπισαν αἱ τρεῖς ἀρχαὶ ἐν ταῖς κερατίναις, καὶ
**20.** συνέτριψαν τὰς ὑδρίας, καὶ ἐλάβοντο ἐν τῇ χειρὶ τῇ ἀριστερᾷ αὐτῶν
τῶν λαμπάδων, καὶ ἐν τῇ χειρὶ τῇ δεξιᾷ αὐτῶν αἱ κερατίναι, τοῦ
σαλπίζειν καὶ ἀνέκραζαν· ῥομφαία τῷ Κυρίῳ καὶ τῷ Γεδεών.
**21.** Καὶ ἔστησεν ἕκαστος καθ᾿ ἑαυτὸν κύκλῳ τῆς παρεμβολῆς· καὶ ἔδραμε
πᾶσα ἡ παρεμβολή, καὶ ἐσήμαναν, καὶ ἔφυγον. Καὶ ἐσάλπισαν αἱ
**22.** τριακόσιαι κερατίναι, καὶ ἔθετο Κύριος μάχαιραν ἀνδρὸς ἐν τῷ
πλησίον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐν ὅλῃ τῇ παρεμβολῇ· καὶ ἔφυγε πᾶσα ἡ
παρεμβολὴ ἕως τῆς Βαιθασσεττά, καὶ συνηγμένη ἕως χείλους
Ἀβελμεουλὰ καὶ ἐπὶ Ταβάθ. Καὶ ἐβόησεν ἀνὴρ Ἰσραὴλ ἐκ Νεφθαλεί,
**23.** καὶ ἐξ Ἀσήρ, καὶ ἐκ παντὸς Μανασσῆ, καὶ κατεδίωξαν ὀπίσω Μαδιάμ.
**24.** Καὶ ἀγγέλους ἐξαπέστειλε Γεδεὼν ἐν παντὶ ὄρει Ἐφραίμ, λέγων·
(ἀνάστητε,) κατάβητε εἰς συνάντησιν Μαδιάμ, καὶ καταλάβετε ἑαυτοῖς
τὸ ὕδωρ ἕως Βαιθθηρὰ καὶ τὸν Ἰορδάνην. Καὶ ἐβόησε πᾶς ἀνὴρ
Ἐφραίμ,

**JUDGES**
**CHAPTER 7.**

**13.** his dream, and he said, "Behold, the dream which I dreamed: and lo, a cake of barley bread was rolling into the camp of Midian, and it came unto the tent of Midian, and it smote it, and it fell,
**14.** and did overturn it upward, and the tent fell." And his neighbor answered and said, "This is none other than the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel; for the Lord hath delivered into his hand Midian and all the camp."
**15.** And it came to pass, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped the Lord; and he returned into the camp of Israel, and said, "Arise ye, for the Lord hath delivered into your hand the camp of Midian."
**16.** And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he gave trumpets into the hand of every man, and empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.
**17.** And he said unto them, "Look on me, and do likewise; and, behold, when I go into the midst of the camp, it shall be that whatsoever I do, that shall ye do also.
**18.** And I will blow with the trumpet, I and all that are with me; and ye shall blow with the trumpets also, round about all the camp, and shall say, 'For the Lord, and for Gideon!' "
**19.** So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, went into a part of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch; and they awakened those that kept watch, and blew with the trumpets, and broke the pitchers that were in their hands.
**20.** And the three companies blew with the trumpets, and broke the pitchers, and they held in their left hand the lamps, and in their right hand the trumpets to blow; and they cried aloud, "The sword for the Lord, and for Gideon!"
**21.** And every man stood in his place round about the camp; and all the camp ran, and they gave a signal, and they fled.
**22.** And the three hundred trumpets blew; and the Lord set every man's sword against his neighbor throughout all the camp; and all the camp fled unto Beth-shittah, and converging unto the border of Abel-meholah and unto Tabbath.
**23.** And the men of Israel cried out from Naphtali, and from Asher, and from all Manasseh; and they pursued after Midian.
**24.** And Gideon sent messengers throughout all the mount of Ephraim, saying, "(Arise,) Come down to meet Midian, and seize for yourselves the waters even unto Beth-barah, and the Jordan." And every man of Ephraim cried out,
