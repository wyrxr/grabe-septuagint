**28** This is the service of the family of the sons of Gershon in the Tabernacle of the Testimony, and their charge [shall be] in the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

**29** [As for] the sons of Merari, thou shalt inspect them according to their families, according to their fathers' houses,
**30** from five and twenty years old and upward, even unto fifty years old, thou shalt inspect them, every one who entereth into the force [of service], to perform the works of the Tabernacle of the Testimony.
**31** And these are the charges of the burdens [to be] borne by them, according to all their works in the Tabernacle of the Testimony: the crossbars of the tabernacle, and its bars, and its pillars, and its bases, and the outermost covering (of the tabernacle),
**32** and its bases, and its pillars; and the covering of the door of the tabernacle; and the pillars of the court round about, and their bases; and the pillars of the screen for the gate of the court, and their bases; and their stakes, and their pegs; and all their vessels, and all their service appointments.

**36** and the muster of them, according to their families,
