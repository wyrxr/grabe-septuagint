ΔΕΥΤΕΡΟΝΟΜΙΟΝ ΚΕΦ. Α΄. Β΄.
θεν δ᾽ Ἀμοῤῥαῖος ὁ κατοικῶν ἐν τῷ ὄρει ἐκείνῳ εἰς συνάντησιν
ὑμῖν, καὶ κατεδίωξεν ὑμᾶς, ὡσεὶ ποιήσασαν αἱ μέλισσαι, καὶ ἐτίτρωσκον ὑμᾶς ἀπὸ Σηεὶρ ἕως Ἑρμᾶ. Καὶ καθίσαντες ἐκλαίετε
ἐναντί Κυρίου, καὶ οὐκ εἰσήκουσε Κύριος τῆς φωνῆς ὑμῶν, οὐδὲ
προσέσχεν ὑμῖν· καὶ ἐνεκάθησθε ἐν Κάδης ἡμέρας πολλὰς, ὅσας
ποτὲ ἡμέρας ἐνεκάθησθε.

ΚΕΦ. Β΄. ΙΙ.

ΚΑΙ ἐπιστραφέντες ἀπήραμεν εἰς τὴν ἔρημον, ὁδὸν θάλασσαν ἐρυθρὰν, ὃν τρόπον ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς μέ· καὶ ἐκυκλώσαμεν τὸ ὄρος τὸ Σηεὶρ ἡμέρας πολλάς. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς μέ,
λέγων· ἱκανούσθω ὑμῖν κυκλοῦν τὸ ὄρος τοῦτο· ἐπιστράφητε οὖν
πρὸς βορρᾶν. Καὶ τῷ λαῷ ἐντεῖλαι, λέγων· ὑμεῖς παραπορεύσεσθε διὰ τῶν ὁρίων τῶν ἀδελφῶν ὑμῶν υἱῶν Ἡσαῦ, οἱ κατοικοῦσιν ἐν Σηεὶρ, καὶ φοβηθήσονταί ὑμᾶς, καὶ εὐλαβηθήσονται σφόδρα.
Μὴ συνάψητε πρὸς αὐτοὺς πόλεμον· οὐ γὰρ μὴ δώσω ὑμῖν ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς
αὐτῶν οὐδὲ βῆμα ποδὸς, ὅτι ἐν κλήρῳ δέδωκα τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἡσαῦ τὸ ὄρος
τὸ Σηείρ. Ἀργυρίου βρώματα ἀγοράσατε ἀπ᾽ αὐτῶν καὶ φάγεσθε,
καὶ ὕδωρ μέτρῳ λήψεσθε παρ᾽ αὐτῶν ἀργυρίου καὶ πίεσθε· δ᾽ γὰρ
Κύριος ὁ Θεός ὑμῶν εὐλόγησε σε ἐν παντὶ ἔργῳ τῶν χειρῶν σου.
Διάγνωθι πῶς διῆλθες τὴν ἔρημον τὴν μεγάλην καὶ τὴν φοβερὰν
ταύτην· ἰδοὺ τεσσαράκοντα ἔτη Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου μετὰ σοῦ, οὐκ
ἐπεδεήθης ῥήματος. Καὶ παρήλθομεν τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς ἡμῶν υἱοὺς
Ἡσαῦ, τοὺς κατοικοῦντας ἐν Σηεὶρ, παρὰ τὴν ὁδὸν τὴν Ἄραβε
ἀπὸ Αἰλὼν καὶ ἀπὸ Γασιὼν Γάβερ· καὶ ἐπιστραφέντες παρήλθομεν ὁδὸν ἔρημον Μωάβ. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς μέ· μὴ ἐχθράνενετε τοῖς Μωαβίταις, καὶ μὴ συνάψητε πρὸς αὐτοὺς πόλεμον· οὐ
γὰρ μὴ δῶ ὑμῖν ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς αὐτῶν ἐν κλήρῳ, τοῖς γὰρ υἱοῖς Λὼτ
δέδωκα τὴν Ἀροὴρ κληρονομεῖν. Οἱ Ὄμμεὶν τοπρότερον ἐνεκάθηντο ἐπ᾽ αὐτῆς, ἔθνος μέγα καὶ πολὺ καὶ ἰσχυρόν, ὥσπερ οἱ Ἑνακείμ. Ῥαφαεὶμ λογισθήσονται καὶ οὗτοι, ὥσπερ οἱ Ἐνακείμ, καὶ
οἱ Μωαβῖται ἐπονομάζουσιν αὐτοὺς Ὄμμεὶν. Καὶ ἐν Σηεὶρ ἐνεκάθητο ὁ Χοῤῥαῖος τοπρότερον, καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Ἡσαῦ ἐξέτριψαν αὐτοὺς, καὶ ἀπώλεσαν αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτῶν, καὶ κατῳκίσθησαν ἀντ᾽ αὐτῶν· ὃν τρόπον ἐποίησεν Ἰσραὴλ τὴν γῆν κληρο-

**DEUTERONOMY CHAPTERS ONE AND TWO**

44 There did the Amorite who dwelleth in that mountain come forth to meet you, and pursued you, as bees are wont to do, and did wound you from Seir even unto Hormah. 45 And ye sat down and wept before the Lord; but the Lord heard not your voice, neither did He give ear unto you. 46 And ye abode in Kadesh many days; even as many days as ye abode there.

**CHAPTER TWO**

1 And we turned and departed into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea, as the Lord had spoken unto me; and we compassed Mount Seir many days. 2 Then the Lord spake unto me, saying, 3 “Ye have compassed this mountain long enough; turn ye therefore northward. 4 And command thou the people, saying, ‘Ye shall pass through the borders of your brethren, the sons of Esau, who dwell in Seir; and they shall fear you, yea, they shall be exceedingly afraid. 5 Engage not in war with them, for I will not give unto you of their land, no, not a foot’s breadth; for I have given Mount Seir to the sons of Esau for an inheritance. 6 For money shall ye buy food of them, and ye shall eat; and water by measure shall ye take of them for money, and ye shall drink. 7 And for the Lord your God hath blessed thee in every work of thine hands. Know thou how thou hast passed through this great and terrible wilderness; behold, forty years hath the Lord thy God been with thee, and thou hast lacked nothing.’”

8 So we passed by our brethren the sons of Esau, who dwelt in Seir, by the way of the Arabah, from Elath and from Ezion-geber. And turning, we passed by the wilderness way of Moab. 9 And the Lord spake unto me, saying, “Provoke not the Moabites, neither engage ye in war with them; for I will not give unto you of their land for an inheritance, for to the sons of Lot have I given Aroer to inherit. 10 The Emim dwelt therein aforetime, a nation great and numerous and strong, like the Enakim. 11 These also shall be reckoned as Rephaim, even as the Enakim; and the Moabites call them Emim. 12 And in Seir the Horites dwelt aforetime, but the sons of Esau utterly destroyed them, and annihilated them from before their face, and dwelt in their stead; in the same manner as Israel did unto the land [of their] inheri-
