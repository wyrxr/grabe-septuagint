ΛΕΥΙΤΙΚΟΝ ΚΕΦ. ΚΖ.
28 Πᾶν δὲ ἀνάθεμα, ὃ ἐὰν ἀναθῇ ἄνθρωπος τῷ Κυρίῳ ἀπὸ πάντων ὅσα αὐτῷ ἐστιν, ἀπὸ ἀνθρώπου ἕως κτήνους, καὶ ἀπὸ ἀγροῦ κατασχέσεως αὐτοῦ, οὐκ ἀποδώσεται, οὐδὲ λυτρώσεται· πᾶν ἀνάθεμα ἅγιον ἁγίων ἔσται τῷ Κυρίῳ.
29 Καὶ πᾶν ἀνάθεμα ὃ ἐὰν ἀνατεθῇ ἀπὸ τῶν ἀνθρώπων, οὐ λυτρώσεται, ἀλλὰ θανάτῳ θανατωθήσεται.
30 Πᾶσα δεκάτη τῆς γῆς ἀπὸ τοῦ σπέρματος τῆς γῆς καὶ τοῦ καρποῦ τοῦ ξυλίνου, τῷ Κυρίῳ ἐστίν· ἅγιον τῷ Κυρίῳ.
31 Ἐὰν δὲ λυτρῶται λύτρῳ ἄνθρωπος τὴν δεκάτην αὐτοῦ, τὸ ἐπίπεμπτον αὐτοῦ προσθήσει πρὸς αὐτό, καὶ ἔσται αὐτῷ.
32 Καὶ πᾶσα δεκάτη βοῶν καὶ προβάτων, καὶ πᾶν ὃ ἐὰν ἔλθῃ ἐν τῷ ἀριθμῷ ὑπὸ τὴν ῥάβδον τὸ δέκατον, ἔσται ἅγιον τῷ Κυρίῳ.
33 Οὐκ ἐπισκέψεται ἀναμέσον καλοῦ καὶ πονηροῦ, οὐκ ἀλλάξεις καλὸν πονηρῷ· ἐὰν δὲ ἀλλάσσων ἀλλάξεις αὐτό, καὶ τὸ ἄλλαγμα αὐτοῦ ἔσται ἅγιον, οὐ λυτρωθήσεται.
34 Αὗται εἰσιν αἱ ἐντολαί, ἃς ἐνετείλατο Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ πρὸς τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τῷ ὄρει Σινᾶ.

**Translation:**

**LEVITICUS CHAPTER 27**

28 And every devoted thing, whatsoever a man shall devote unto the Lord from all that he possesseth, from man even unto beast, and from the field of his inheritance, it shall not be sold, neither shall it be redeemed; every devoted thing shall be most holy unto the Lord.

29 And every devoted thing that shall be devoted from among men, it shall not be redeemed, but by death shall it surely die.

30 Moreover, every tithe of the land, whether it be of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, it is the Lord’s; it is holy unto the Lord.

31 And if a man will redeem any of his tithe with a redemption price, then shall he add the fifth part thereof unto it, and it shall be his.

32 And every tithe of the herd and of the flock, and every tenth [animal] among all that pass under the rod in the count, shall be holy unto the Lord.

33 He shall not discern between the good and the bad, neither shalt thou exchange the good for the bad: and if thou shalt in any wise exchange it, then shall both it and its exchange be holy; it shall not be redeemed.

34 These are the commandments, which the Lord commanded Moses for the children of Israel on Mount Sinai.
