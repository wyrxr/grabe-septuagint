17 σου. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· σχολάζετε, σχολιασταί ἐστε· διὰ τοῦτο λέ-
18 γετε· πορευθῶμεν, (καὶ) θύσωμεν τῷ Θεῷ ἡμῶν. Νῦν οὖν ἀπελ-
    θόντες, ἐργάζεσθε· τὸ γὰρ ἄχυρον οὐ δοθήσεται ὑμῖν, καὶ τὴν
19 σύνταξιν τῆς πλινθείας ἀποδώσετε. Ἐώρων δὲ οἱ γραμματεῖς τῶν
    υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ ἑαυτοὺς ἐν κακοῖς, λέγοντες· οὐκ ἀπολείψετε ἀπὸ
20 τῆς πλινθείας τὸ καθῆκον τῇ ἡμέρᾳ. Συνήντησαν δὲ Μωσῇ καὶ
    Ἀαρὼν ἐρχομένοις εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτοῖς, ἐκπορευομένων αὐτῶν
21 ἀπὸ Φαραώ· καὶ εἶπαν αὐτοῖς· ἐπίδοι ὁ Θεὸς ὑμᾶς καὶ κρῖναι·
    ὅτι ἐβδελύξατε τὴν ὀσμὴν ἡμῶν ἐναντίον Φαραώ, καὶ ἐναντίον
    τῶν θεραπόντων αὐτοῦ, δοῦναι ῥομφαίαν εἰς τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ,
22 ἀποκτεῖναι ἡμᾶς. Ἐπέστρεψε δὲ Μωσῆς πρὸς Κύριον, καὶ εἶπε·
    Κύριε, διὰ τί ἐκάκωσας τὸν λαὸν τοῦτον; καὶ ἵνατί ἀπέσταλκάς
23 με; καὶ ἀφ᾿ οὗ πεπόρευμαι πρὸς Φαραώ, λαλῆσαι (αὐτῷ) ἐπὶ τῷ
    σῷ ὀνόματι, ἐκάκωσε τὸν λαὸν τοῦτον, καὶ ῥύσας οὐκ ἐρρύσω
    τὸν λαόν σου.

ΚΕΦ. ϛ´. VI.

1   ΚΑΙ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Μωσῆν· ἤδη ὄψει, ἃ ποιήσω τῷ Φα-
    ραώ· ἐν γὰρ χειρὶ κραταιᾷ ἐξαποστελεῖ αὐτούς, καὶ ἐν βραχίονι
2   ὑψηλῷ ἐκβαλεῖ αὐτοὺς ἐκ τῆς γῆς αὐτοῦ. Ἐλάλησε δὲ ὁ Θεὸς
3   πρὸς Μωσῆν, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτόν· ἐγὼ Κύριος· καὶ ὤφθην πρὸς
    Ἀβραὰμ καὶ Ἰσαὰκ καὶ Ἰακώβ, Θεὸς ὢν αὐτῶν, καὶ τὸ ὄνομά
4   μου Κύριος οὐκ ἐδήλωσα αὐτοῖς· καὶ ἔστησα τὴν διαθήκην μου
    πρὸς αὐτούς, ὥστε δοῦναι αὐτοῖς τὴν γῆν τῶν Χαναναιῶν, τὴν
5   γῆν ἣν παρῴκηκασιν, ἐν ᾗ καὶ παρῴκησαν ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς· καὶ ἐγὼ
    εἰσήκουσα τὸν στεναγμὸν τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, ὃν οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι κα-
6   ταδουλοῦνται αὐτούς, καὶ ἐμνήσθην τῆς διαθήκης μου. Βάδιζε, εἰπον
    τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ, λέγων· ἐγὼ Κύριος, καὶ ἐξάξω ὑμᾶς ἀπὸ
    τῆς δυναστείας τῶν Αἰγυπτίων, καὶ ῥύσομαι ὑμᾶς ἐκ τῆς δου-
    λείας αὐτῶν, καὶ λυτρώσομαι ὑμᾶς ἐν βραχίονι ὑψηλῷ, καὶ κρί-
7   σει μεγάλη· καὶ λήψομαι ὑμᾶς ἐμαυτῷ εἰς λαὸν ἐμοί, καὶ ἔσο-
    μαι ὑμῶν Θεός· καὶ γνώσεσθε, ὅτι ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν,
    ὁ ἐξαγαγὼν ὑμᾶς ἐκ τῆς καταδυναστείας τῶν Αἰγυπτίων· καὶ
8   εἰσάξω ὑμᾶς εἰς τὴν γῆν, εἰς ἣν ἐξέτεινα τὴν χεῖρά μου, δοῦ-
    ναι αὐτὴν τῷ Ἀβραὰμ καὶ Ἰσαὰκ καὶ Ἰακώβ, καὶ δώσω αὐτήν

### Exodus Chapter 5

17 of you. And he said unto them, Ye are idle, ye are idlers; for this cause ye say, Let us go, (and) let us sacrifice unto our God.
18 Now therefore depart, and work; for the straw shall not be given unto you, and the
19 tale of bricks shall ye render. And the scribes of the sons of Israel saw themselves to be in sore straits, saying, Ye shall not diminish from
20 the tale of bricks [that is] due for the day. And it came to pass, as they went out from Pharaoh, that they met Moses and Aaron, who were coming forth to meet them.
21 Pharaoh. And they said unto them, May God look upon you and judge [you]; for ye have made our savor to be an abomination before Pharaoh, and before his servants, to give a sword into his hands,
22 to slay us. And Moses turned again unto the Lord, and said, Lord, wherefore hast Thou afflicted this people? And for what cause hast Thou sent
23 me? For since I went unto Pharaoh, to speak (unto him) in Thy name, he hath afflicted this people; and delivered [them] Thou hast not, yea, Thou hast not delivered Thy people.

### Exodus Chapter 6

1 And the Lord said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do unto Pharaoh; for with a strong hand shall he send them forth, and with a high arm
2 shall he cast them out from his land. And God spake
3 unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the Lord; and I appeared unto Abraham, and unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, being their God; but My name, [even] the Lord, I did not make known unto them.
4 And I established My covenant with them, that I would give unto them the land of the Canaanites, even the
5 land wherein they sojourned, in which also they sojourned upon it. And I have heard the groaning of the sons of Israel, whom the Egyptians hold in bondage; and I have remembered My covenant.
6 Go, say unto the sons of Israel, saying, I am the Lord, and I will bring you out from the dominion of the Egyptians, and I will rescue you from their servitude, and I will redeem you with a high arm, and with great judgment;
7 and I will take you to Myself for a people unto Me, and I will be your God; and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God, who brought you out from the oppression of the Egyptians;
8 And I will bring you into the land, concerning which I stretched forth My hand, to give it unto Abraham, and to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it
