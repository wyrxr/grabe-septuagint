ἦλθεν Ἰησοῦς καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ὁ πολεμιστὴς μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἐπ᾿ αὐτούς ἐπὶ τὸ ὕδωρ Μεῤῥὼμ ἐξάπινα, καὶ ἐπέπεσαν αὐτοῖς ἐν τῇ
ὀρεινῇ. Καὶ παρέδωκεν αὐτοὺς Κύριος ὑποχειρίους Ἰσραήλ· καὶ 8
κόπτοντες αὐτοὺς κατεδίωκον αὐτοὺς ἕως Σιδῶνος τῆς μεγάλης
καὶ ἕως Μασερεφὼθ-Μαΐμ, καὶ ἕως τῶν πεδίων Μασσηρὰ κατ᾿
ἀνατολάς· καὶ κατέκοψαν αὐτοὺς ἕως τοῦ μὴ καταλειφθῆναι αὐτῶν διασεσωσμένον. Καὶ ἐποίησεν αὐτοῖς Ἰησοῦς, καθότι ἐνετεί- 9
λατο αὐτῷ Κύριος· τοὺς ἵππους αὐτῶν ἐνευροκόπησε, καὶ τὰ ἅρ-
ματα αὐτῶν ἐνέπρησεν ἐν πυρί. Καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν Ἰησοῦς ἐν τῷ 10
καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ, καὶ κατελάβετο τὴν Ἀσώρ, καὶ τὸν βασιλέα αὐτῆς
ἀπέκτεινεν ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ· ὅτι Ἀσὼρ ἦν τὸ πρότερον ἄρχουσα πασῶν
τῶν βασιλειῶν τούτων. Καὶ ἀπέκτειναν πᾶν ἔμπνεον ὃ ἐν αὐτῇ 11
ἐν στόματι ξίφους, καὶ ἐξωλόθρευσαν πάντας, καὶ οὐ κατελείφθη
ἐν αὐτῇ ἔμπνεον· καὶ τὴν Ἀσὼρ ἐνέπρησαν ἐν πυρί. Καὶ πάσας 12
τὰς πόλεις τῶν βασιλειῶν τούτων καὶ πάντας τοὺς βασιλεῖς αὐτῶν ἔλαβεν Ἰησοῦς, καὶ ἀνεῖλεν αὐτοὺς ἐν στόματι ξίφους, καὶ
ἐξωλόθρευσεν αὐτούς, ὃν τρόπον συνέταξε Μωυσῆς ὁ παῖς Κυ-
ρίου. Ἀλλὰ πάσας τὰς πόλεις τὰς κεχωματισμένας αὐτῶν οὐκ 13
ἐνέπρησεν Ἰσραήλ· πλὴν τὴν Ἀσὼρ μόνην, αὐτὴν ἐνέπρησεν Ἰησοῦς.
Καὶ πάντα τὰ σκῦλα αὐτῆς καὶ τὰ κτήνη ἐπρονόμευσαν ἑαυτοῖς οἱ υἱοὶ 14
Ἰσραήλ, κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα Κυρίου ὃ ἐνετείλατο τῷ Ἰησοῦ ἀνθρώπους δὲ πάντας ἐξωλόθρευσαν ἐν στόματι ξίφους, ἕως ἀπώλεσαν
αὐτούς, οὐ κατέλιπον αὐτῶν οὐδὲ ἓν ἔμπνεον. Ὃν τρόπον συν- 15
έταξε Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ τῷ παιδὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ Μωυσῆς ὡσαύτως ἐνετείλατο τῷ Ἰησοῖ· καὶ οὕτως ἐποίησεν Ἰησοῦς, οὐ παρέβη οὐδὲν ἀπὸ πάντων ὧν συνέταξε Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ. Καὶ ἔλα- 16
βεν Ἰησοῦς τὴν πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν ταύτην τὴν ὀρεινήν, καὶ τὴν πᾶσαν (τὴν γῆν) τὴν Ναγέβ, καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν Γοσὸμ, καὶ τὴν
πεδινήν, καὶ τὴν πρὸς δυσμαῖς, καὶ τὸ ὄρος Ἰσραήλ, καὶ τὰ πεδινὰ αὐτοῦ, τὰ πρὸς τῷ ὄρει Ἄλακ, καὶ ὃ προσαναβαίνει εἰς 17
Σπειρὰ καὶ ἕως Βαλγαδ, καὶ τὸ πεδίον τοῦ Λιβάνου ὑπὸ τὸ ὄρος
τῶν Ἀερμὼν· καὶ τοὺς βασιλεῖς αὐτῶν πάντας ἔλαβε, καὶ ἀνεῖλεν αὐτούς, καὶ ἀπέκτεινεν αὐτούς. Καὶ ἡμέρας πλείους ἐποίησεν 18
Ἰησοῦς πρὸς πάντας τοὺς βασιλεῖς τούτους τὸν πόλεμον· καὶ οὐκ
ἦν πόλις, ἥτις οὐ παρέδωκε τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ, πλὴν ὁ Εὔαιος 19
ὁ κατοικῶν ἐν Γαβαών· πάντα ἔλαβεν ἐν πολέμῳ. Ὅτι διὰ Κυρίου ἐγένετο, κατισχύσαι τὴν καρδίαν αὐτῶν συναντᾷν εἰς πόλεμον πρὸς Ἰσραήλ, ἵνα ἐξολοθρευθῶσιν, ἔπως μὴ δοθῇ αὐτοῖς ἔλεος, ἀλλ᾿ ἵνα ἐξολοθρευθῶσιν, ὃν τρόπον εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Μω-
υσῆν.

**Joshua 11**

<sup>7</sup> Then Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, suddenly upon them by the waters of Merom, and they fell upon them in the hill country.
<sup>8</sup> And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel; and they smote them, and pursued them unto great Sidon, and unto Misrephoth-maim, and unto the plains of Massera eastward; and they smote them until there was not one of them left that was saved.
<sup>9</sup> And Joshua did unto them as the LORD had commanded him: their horses he hamstrung, and their chariots he burned with fire.
<sup>10</sup> And Joshua turned back at that time, and took Hazor, and slew the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all these kingdoms.
<sup>11</sup> And they smote every living thing that was therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them all: there was not one living thing left in it; and Hazor they burned with fire.
<sup>12</sup> And all the cities of these kingdoms, and all their kings, did Joshua take, and he smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded.
<sup>13</sup> But as for all the cities that stood on their mounds, Israel burned none of them; save Hazor only, that did Joshua burn.
<sup>14</sup> And all the spoil thereof, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; according to the word of the LORD which He had commanded Joshua. But all the people they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any living thing.
<sup>15</sup> As the LORD commanded Moses His servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD had commanded Moses.
<sup>16</sup> So Joshua took all that land, the hill country, and all [the land of] the Negeb, and all the land of Goshen, and the plain, and the western region, and the mountain of Israel, and its lowlands, even that which goeth up toward Mount Halak,
<sup>17</sup> and that which goeth up unto Seira, and even unto Balgad in the valley of Lebanon, under Mount Hermon; and all their kings he took, and smote them, and slew them.
<sup>18</sup> And many days did Joshua make war with all these kings.
<sup>19</sup> There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivite that dwelt in Gibeon: all [other cities] did he take in battle.
<sup>20</sup> For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that He might destroy them utterly, and that no mercy should be shown them, but that He might utterly destroy them, as the LORD commanded Moses.
