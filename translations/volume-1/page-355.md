ΔΕΥΤΕΡΟΝΟΜΙΟΝ ΚΕΦ. Ιϛʹ.
11 λόγησέ σε Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου· καὶ εὐφρανθήσῃ ἔναντι Κυρίου τοῦ
Θεοῦ σου, σὺ καὶ ὁ υἱός σου καὶ ἡ θυγάτηρ σου, ὁ παῖς σου καὶ
ἡ παιδίσκη σου, καὶ ὁ Λευίτης ὁ ἐν ταῖς πόλεσί σου, καὶ ὁ προσήλυτος,
καὶ ὁ ὀρφανός, καὶ ἡ χήρα ἡ ἐν ὑμῖν, ἐν τῷ τόπῳ ᾧ
ἂν ἐκλέξηται Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου αὐτόν, ἐπικληθῆναι τὸ ὄνομα αὐ-
12 τοῦ ἐκεῖ· καὶ μνησθήσῃ ὅτι οἰκέτης ἦσθα ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ, καὶ φυλάξεις
καὶ ποιήσεις τὰς ἐντολὰς ταύτας.
13 Ἑορτὴν τῶν σκηνῶν ποιήσεις σεαυτῷ ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας, ἐν τῷ συναγαγεῖν
σε ἐκ τῆς ἅλωνός σου καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς ληνοῦ σου·
14 καὶ εὐφρανθήσῃ ἐν τῇ ἑορτῇ σου, σὺ καὶ ὁ υἱός σου καὶ ἡ θυγάτηρ
σου, ὁ παῖς σου καὶ ἡ παιδίσκη σου, καὶ ὁ Λευίτης, καὶ ὁ προσήλυτος,
καὶ ὁ ὀρφανός, καὶ ἡ χήρα ἡ οὖσα ἐν ταῖς πόλεσί σου·
15 ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας ἑορτάσεις Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ σου ἐν τῷ τόπῳ ᾧ ἂν ἐκλέξηται
Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου αὐτόν, (ἐπικληθῆναι τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ ἐκεῖ)·
ἐὰν δὲ εὐλογήσῃ σε Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς γεννήμασί σου,
καὶ ἐν παντὶ ἔργῳ τῶν χειρῶν σου, καὶ ἔσῃ πλὴν εὐφραινόμενος.
16 Τρεῖς καιροὺς τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ ὀφθήσεται πᾶν ἀρσενικόν σου ἐναντίον
Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ σου ἐν τῷ τόπῳ ᾧ ἂν ἐκλέξηται Κύριος· ἐν τῇ ἑορτῇ
τῶν ἀζύμων, καὶ ἐν τῇ ἑορτῇ τῶν ἑβδομάδων, καὶ ἐν τῇ ἑορτῇ τῆς
σκηνοπηγίας.
17 Οὐκ ὀφθήσῃ ἐνώπιον Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ σου κενός· ἕκαστος κατὰ
δύναμιν τῶν χειρῶν ὑμῶν, κατὰ τὴν εὐλογίαν Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ
σου, ἣν ἔδωκέ σοι.
18 Κριτὰς καὶ γραμματοεισαγωγεῖς καταστήσεις σεαυτῷ ἐν πάσαις ταῖς
πόλεσί σου, αἷς Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου δίδωσί σοι, κατὰ φυλάς σου,
καὶ κρινοῦσι τὸν λαὸν κρίσιν δικαίαν.
19 Οὐκ ἐκκλινοῦσι κρίσιν, οὐκ ἐπιγνώσονται πρόσωπον, οὐδὲ λήψονται
δῶρα· τὰ γὰρ δῶρα ἐκτυφλοῖ ὀφθαλμοὺς σοφῶν, καὶ ἐξαίρει
20 λόγους δικαίων. Δικαίως τὸ δίκαιον διώξῃ, ἵνα ζῆτε, καὶ εἰσέλθοντες
κληρονομήσητε τὴν γῆν, ἣν Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου δίδωσί σοι.
21 Οὐ φυτεύσεις σεαυτῷ ἄλπος, πᾶν ξύλον, παρὰ τὸ θυσιαστήριον
Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ σου, ὃ ποιήσεις σεαυτῷ.
22 Οὐ στήσεις σεαυτῷ στήλην, ἃ ἐμίσησε Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου.

### Deuteronomy 16

11 For the Lord your God hath blessed you; and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God, you and your son and your daughter, your male servant and your female servant, and the Levite who is in your cities, and the sojourner, and the orphan, and the widow who is among you, in the place which the Lord your God shall choose for Himself, for His Name to be called upon there.

12 And you shall remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt; and you shall keep and perform these commandments.

13 You shall keep for yourself the Feast of Tabernacles seven days, when you gather in [the produce] from your threshing floor and from your winepress.

14 And you shall rejoice in your feast, you and your son and your daughter, your male servant and your female servant, and the Levite, and the sojourner, and the orphan, and the widow who is in your cities.

15 Seven days shall you keep a feast unto the Lord your God in the place which the Lord your God shall choose for Himself, (for His Name to be called upon there); for if the Lord your God shall bless you in all your increase, and in every work of your hands, you shall be surely rejoicing.

16 Three times in the year shall every male among you appear before the Lord your God in the place which the Lord shall choose: in the Feast of Unleavened Bread, and in the Feast of Weeks, and in the Feast of Tabernacles.

17 You shall not appear before the Lord your God empty-handed; every man according to the ability of your hands, according to the blessing of the Lord your God, which He hath given you.

18 You shall appoint judges and magistrate-clerks for yourself in all your cities, which the Lord your God gives you, according to your tribes; and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment.

19 They shall not pervert judgment, they shall not show partiality, neither shall they take gifts; for gifts do blind the eyes of the wise, and subvert the words of the righteous.

20 Righteously shall you pursue righteousness, that you may live, and having entered, you may inherit the land which the Lord your God gives you.

21 You shall not plant for yourself a white spot, [even] any tree, beside the altar of the Lord your God, which you shall make for yourself.

22 You shall not set up for yourself a pillar, which things the Lord your God hath hated.
