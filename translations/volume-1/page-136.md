λεύειν τοῖς Αἰγυπτίοις, ἢ ἀποθανεῖν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ ταύτῃ. Εἶπε δὲ 13
Μωυσῆς πρὸς τὸν λαόν· θαρσεῖτε, στήκετε καὶ ὁρᾶτε τὴν σωτη-
ρίαν τὴν παρὰ τοῦ Κυρίου, ἣν ποιήσει ὑμῖν σήμερον· ὃν τρόπον
γὰρ ἑωράκατε τοὺς Αἰγυπτίους σήμερον, οὐ προσθήσεσθε ἔτι ἰδεῖν
αὐτοὺς εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα χρόνον. Κύριος πολεμήσει περὶ ὑμῶν, καὶ 14
ὑμεῖς σιγήσετε. Εἶπε δὲ Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν· τί βόᾷς πρὸς με; 15
λάλησον τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἀναζευξάτωσαν. Καὶ σὺ ἔπαρον 16
τὴν ῥάβδον σου, καὶ ἔκτεινον τὴν χεῖρά σου ἐπὶ τὴν θάλασσαν,
καὶ ῥῆξον αὐτήν· καὶ εἰσελθάτωσαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ εἰς μέσον τῆς
θαλάσσης κατὰ τὸ ξηρόν. Καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ σκληρυνῶ τὴν καρδίαν 17
Φαραὼ καὶ τῶν Αἰγυπτίων πάντων, καὶ εἰσελεύσονται ὀπίσω αὐ-
τῶν, καὶ ἐνδοξασθήσομαι ἐν Φαραώ, καὶ ἐν πάσῃ τῇ στρατιᾷ αὐτοῦ,
καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἅρμασι, καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἵπποις αὐτοῦ· καὶ γνώσονται πάν- 18
τες οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι, ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι Κύριος, ἐνδοξαζομένου μου ἐν
Φαραώ, καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἅρμασι, καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἵπποις αὐτοῦ. Ἐξῆρε 19
δὲ ὁ ἄγγελος τοῦ Θεοῦ, ὁ προπορευόμενος τῆς παρεμβολῆς τῶν
υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἐκ τῶν ὄπισθεν αὐτῶν. Ἐξῆρε δὲ καὶ
ὁ στύλος τῆς νεφέλης ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔστη ἐκ τῶν
ὄπισω αὐτῶν· καὶ εἰσῆλθεν ἀνὰ μέσον τῆς παρεμβολῆς τῶν Αἰ- 20
γυπτίων, καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον τῆς παρεμβολῆς Ἰσραήλ, (καὶ ἔστη)· καὶ
ἐγένετο σκότος καὶ γνόφος, καὶ διῆλθεν ἡ νύξ, καὶ οὐ συνέμιξαν
ἀλλήλοις ὅλην τὴν νύκτα. Ἐξέτεινε δὲ Μωυσῆς τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ 21
ἐπὶ τὴν θάλασσαν· καὶ ὑπήγαγε Κύριος τὴν θάλασσαν ἐν ἀνέμῳ
νότῳ βιαίῳ ὅλην τὴν νύκτα, καὶ ἐποίησε τὴν θάλασσαν ξηράν, καὶ
διεσχίσθη τὸ ὕδωρ. Καὶ εἰσῆλθον οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ εἰς μέσον τῆς 22
θαλάσσης κατὰ τὸ ξηρόν· καὶ τὸ ὕδωρ αὐτοῖς τεῖχος ἐκ δεξιῶν,
καὶ τεῖχος ἐξ εὐωνύμων. Κατεδίωξαν δὲ οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι, καὶ εἰσῆλ- 23
θον ὀπίσω αὐτῶν πᾶσα ἡ ἵππος Φαραώ, καὶ τὰ ἅρματα, καὶ οἱ
ἀναβάται (καὶ εἰσῆλθον) εἰς μέσον τῆς θαλάσσης. Ἐγενήθη δὲ ἐν 24
τῇ φυλακῇ τῇ ἑωθινῇ, καὶ ἐπέβλεψε Κύριος εἰς τὴν παρεμβολὴν
τῶν Αἰγυπτίων ἐν στύλῳ πυρὸς καὶ νεφέλης, καὶ συνετάραξε τὴν
παρεμβολὴν τῶν Αἰγυπτίων· καὶ συνέδησε τοὺς ἄξονας τῶν ἁρ- 25
μάτων αὐτῶν, καὶ ἦγεν αὐτοὺς μετὰ βίας. Καὶ εἶπαν οἱ Αἰγύ-
πτιοι· φεύγωμεν ἀπὸ προσώπου Ἰσραήλ· ὁ γὰρ Κύριος πολεμεῖ
τοὺς Αἰγυπτίους περὶ αὐτῶν. Εἶπε δὲ Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν· ἔκ- 26
τεινον τὴν χεῖρά σου ἐπὶ τὴν θάλασσαν, καὶ ἀποκαταστήτω τὸ

**Chapter 14**

13 ...to serve the Egyptians, or to die in this wilderness."

Then Moses said unto the people, "Fear ye not, stand ye still, and behold the salvation of the Lord, which He shall work for you this day; for the Egyptians whom ye have seen this day, ye shall not see them again for all time to come.
14 The Lord Himself shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace."

15 And the Lord said unto Moses, "Wherefore criest thou unto Me? Speak unto the children of Israel, that they break camp and journey onward.
16 And as for thee, lift up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it; and let the children of Israel go forth into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground.
17 And behold, I shall harden the heart of Pharaoh and of all the Egyptians, and they shall go in after them; and I shall be glorified in Pharaoh, and in all his host,
18 yea, and in his chariots, and in his horsemen. And all the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, when I am glorified through Pharaoh, and through his chariots, and through his horsemen."

19 Then the Angel of God, who went before the camp of the children of Israel, removed and went behind them. And the pillar of the cloud also removed from before their face, and stood behind them;
20 and it came between the camp of the Egyptians and between the camp of Israel, (and it stood); and there was darkness and a thick gloom, and the night passed, so that they drew not near one another throughout all the night.

21 And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea; and the Lord drove back the sea by a strong south wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and divided were the waters.
22 And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground; and the water was unto them a wall on their right hand, and a wall on their left hand.

23 And the Egyptians pursued them, and went in after them—even all Pharaoh's horse-troops, and his chariots, and his riders (and they went in) into the midst of the sea.
24 And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the Lord looked upon the camp of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of cloud, and troubled the camp of the Egyptians.
25 And He bound the axles of their chariots, and drove them with strong force.

And the Egyptians said, "Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the Lord doth fight the Egyptians on their behalf."
26 And the Lord said unto Moses, "Stretch out thine hand over the sea, and let the [water] return..."
