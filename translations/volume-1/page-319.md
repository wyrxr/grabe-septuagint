ΚΕΦ. ΛΕ´.

τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀποθάνῃ, θανάτῳ θανατούσθω ὁ πατάξας· φο-
νευτὴς ἔστι, θανάτῳ θανατούσθω ὁ φονεύων, ὁ ἀγχιστεύων τὸ αἷ-
22 μα ἀποκτενεῖ τὸν φονεύσαντα ἐν τῷ συναντῆσαι αὐτὸν αὐτῷ. Ἐὰν
δὲ ἐξαπίνης οὐ δι᾽ ἔχθραν ὤσῃ αὐτόν, ἢ ἐπιρρίψῃ ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν πᾶν
23 σκεῦος οὐκ ἐξ ἐνέδρου, ἢ ἐν παντὶ λίθῳ, ἐν ᾧ ἀποθανεῖται ἐν
αὐτῇ, οὐκ εἰδώς, καὶ ἐπιπέσῃ ἐπ᾿ αὐτόν, καὶ ἀποθάνῃ, αὐτὸς δὲ
24 οὐκ ἐχθρὸς αὐτοῦ ἦν, οὐδὲ ζητῶν κακοποιῆσαι αὐτόν, καὶ κρινεῖ
ἡ συναγωγὴ ἀναμέσον τοῦ πατάξαντος καὶ ἀναμέσον τοῦ ἀγχι-
25 στεύοντος τὸ αἷμα, κατὰ τὰ κρίματα ταῦτα· καὶ ἐξελεῖται ἡ συ-
ναγωγὴ τὸν φονεύσαντα ἀπὸ χειρὸς τοῦ ἀγχιστεύοντος τὸ αἷμα,
καὶ εἰς τὴν πόλιν τοῦ φυγαδευτηρίου αὐτοῦ ἀποκαταστήσει αὐτὸν
ἡ συναγωγή, οὗ κατέφυγεν ἐκεῖ, καὶ κατοικήσει ἐκεῖ ἕως ἂν ἀ-
ποθάνῃ ὁ ἱερεὺς ὁ μέγας, ὃν ἔχρισεν αὐτὸν τῷ ἐλαίῳ τῷ ἁγίῳ.
26 Ἐὰν δὲ ἐξόδῳ ἐξέλθῃ ὁ φονεύσας τὰ ὅρια τῆς πόλεως τοῦ φυ-
27 γαδευτηρίου αὐτοῦ, εἰς ἣν κατέφυγεν ἐκεῖ, καὶ εὕρῃ αὐτὸν ὁ ἀγ-
χιστεύων τὸ αἷμα ἔξω τῶν ὁρίων τῆς πόλεως καταφυγῆς αὐτοῦ,
καὶ φονεύσῃ ὁ ἀγχιστεύων τὸ αἷμα τὸν φονεύσαντα, οὐκ ἔνοχός
28 ἐστιν· ἐν γὰρ τῇ πόλει τῆς καταφυγῆς αὐτοῦ κατοικείτω ἕως ἂν
ἀποθάνῃ ὁ ἱερεὺς ὁ μέγας· καὶ μετὰ τὸ ἀποθανεῖν τὸν ἱερέα τὸν
μέγαν, ἐπαναστραφήσεται ὁ φονεύσας εἰς τὴν γῆν τῆς κατασχέ-
29 σεως αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἔσται ταῦτα ὑμῖν εἰς δικαίωμα κρίματος εἰς
30 τὰς γενεὰς ὑμῶν ἐν πάσαις ταῖς κατοικίαις ὑμῶν. Πᾶς πατάξας
ψυχὴν, διὰ στόματος μαρτύρων φονεύσει τὸν φονεύσαντα· καὶ μάρ-
31 τυς εἷς οὐ μαρτυρήσει ἐπὶ ψυχὴν, ἀποθανεῖν. Καὶ οὐ λήψεσθε
λύτρα ἐπὶ ψυχῆς παρὰ τοῦ φονεύσαντος τοῦ ἐνόχου ὄντος ἀναι-
32 ρεθῆναι· θανάτῳ γὰρ θανατωθήσεται. Καὶ οὐ λήψεσθε λύτρα τοῦ
φυγεῖν εἰς πόλιν τῶν φυγαδευτηρίων, τοῦ πάλιν κατοικεῖν ἐπὶ τῆς
33 γῆς, ἕως ἂν ἀποθάνῃ ὁ ἱερεὺς ὁ μέγας. Καὶ οὐ μὴ φονοκτονή-
σητε τὴν γῆν, ἐφ᾽ ἧς ὑμεῖς κατοικεῖτε ἐπ᾽ αὐτῆς· τὸ γὰρ
αἷμα τοῦτο φονοκτονεῖ τὴν γῆν, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἐξιλασθήσεται
ἡ γῆ ἀπὸ τοῦ αἵματος τοῦ ἐκχυθέντος ἐπ᾽ αὐτῆς, ἀλλ᾽ ἐπὶ τοῦ
34 αἵματος τοῦ ἐκχέοντος αὐτό· καὶ οὐ μιανεῖτε τὴν γῆν, ἐφ᾽ ἧς
ὑμεῖς κατοικεῖτε ἐπ᾽ αὐτῆς, ἐφ᾽ ἧς ἐγὼ κατασκηνῶ ἐπ᾽ αὐτῆς·
ἐγὼ γὰρ εἰμι Κύριος ὁ κατασκηνῶν ἐν μέσῳ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ.

**English Translation:**

**Chapter 35**

21 If with his hand he smite him, and he die, then shall he that smote him surely be put to death; for he is a murderer. He that murdereth shall surely be put to death.
22 The avenger of blood shall slay him that murdered, when he doth meet him.
23 But if suddenly, without enmity, he thrust him, or cast upon him any vessel not of ambush, or with any stone, in which [manner] he shall die in it, and he knew it not, and it fell upon him, and he died,
24 and he himself was not his enemy, nor sought to do him evil; then shall the congregation judge between him that smote, and between the avenger of blood,
25 according to these judgments. And the congregation shall deliver the slayer from the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him unto his city of refuge, whither he fled, and he shall dwell there until the great priest die, whom they anointed him with the holy oil.
26 But if the slayer shall go forth by a way beyond the borders of his city of refuge, whither he hath fled,
27 and the avenger of blood find him without the borders of his city of refuge, and the avenger of blood slay the slayer, he shall not be guilty.
28 For in the city of his refuge shall he dwell until the great priest die; and after the great priest is dead, the slayer shall return unto the land of his possession.
29 And these shall be unto you a righteous ordinance of judgment throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
30 Whosoever smiteth a soul, by the mouth of witnesses shall he slay the murderer; but one witness shall not testify against a soul, [so that it should] die.
31 And ye shall not take ransom for a life from the murderer, who is guilty of being put to death; for he shall surely be put to death.
32 Neither shall ye take ransom for him that fleeth to the city of refuge, that he might again dwell in the land, until the great priest die.
33 And ye shall not murder the land, upon which ye dwell upon it; for this blood doth murder the land, and the land shall not be purged from the blood that is poured out upon it, save by the blood of him that poureth it out.
34 And ye shall not defile the land, upon which ye dwell upon it, upon which I do encamp upon it; for I am the LORD, who encampeth in the midst of the children of Israel.
