ΚΕΦ. ΛΔ΄. ΕΞΟΔΟΣ 159
ἡμῶν καὶ τὰς ἀνομίας ἡμῶν, καὶ ἐσόμεθά σοι. Καὶ ἐλάλησε Κύ- 10
ριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ τίθημι διαθήκην ἐνώπιον παντὸς τοῦ
λαοῦ σου· ποιήσω ἔνδοξα, ἃ οὐ γέγονεν ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ, καὶ ἐν
παντὶ ἔθνει, καὶ ὄψεται πᾶς ὁ λαός, ἐν οἷς εἶ σύ, τὰ ἔργα Κυ-
ρίου, ὅτι θαυμαστὰ ἔστιν, ἃ ἐγὼ ποιήσω σοι. Πρόσεχε σὺ πάν- 11
τα, ὅσα ἐγὼ ἐντέλλομαί σοι· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐκβάλλω ἀπὸ προσώπου
σου τὸν Ἀμοῤῥαῖον, καὶ τὸν Χαναναῖον, καὶ τὸν Χετταῖον, καὶ
τὸν Φερεζαῖον, καὶ τὸν Εὐαῖον, καὶ τὸν Γεργεσαῖον, καὶ τὸν Ἱε-
βουσαῖον· πρόσεχε σεαυτῷ, μή ποτε διαθῇς διαθήκην τοῖς ἐγκα- 12
θημένοις ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, εἰς ἣν σὺ εἰσπορεύῃ εἰς αὐτήν, μή ποτε
γένηται πρόσκομμα ἐν ὑμῖν. Τοὺς βωμοὺς αὐτῶν καθελεῖτε, καὶ 13
τὰς στήλας αὐτῶν συντρίψετε, καὶ τὰ ἄλση αὐτῶν ἐκκόψετε, καὶ
τὰ γλυπτὰ τῶν θεῶν αὐτῶν κατακαύσετε πυρί· οὐ γὰρ μή προ- 14
σκυνήσητε θεῷ ἑτέρῳ· ὁ γὰρ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ζηλωτὸν ὄνομα αὐ-
τοῦ, Θεὸς ζηλωτής ἐστι. Μή ποτε διαθῇς διαθήκην τοῖς ἐγκαθη- 15
μένοις ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἐκπορνεύσωσιν ὀπίσω τῶν θεῶν αὐτῶν,
καὶ θύσωσι τοῖς θεοῖς αὐτῶν, καὶ καλέσωσί σε, καὶ φάγῃς τῶν 16
θυσιῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ λάβῃς τῶν θυγατέρων αὐτῶν τοῖς υἱοῖς σου,
καὶ τῶν θυγατέρων σου δώσεις τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐκπορνεύ-
σωσιν αἱ θυγατέρες σου ὀπίσω τῶν θεῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐκπορνεύ-
σωσιν οἱ υἱοί σου ὀπίσω τῶν θεῶν αὐτῶν. Καὶ θεοὺς χωνευτοὺς 17
οὐ ποιήσεις σεαυτῷ. Καὶ τὴν ἑορτὴν τῶν ἀζύμων φυλάξῃ· ἑπτὰ 18
ἡμέρας φάγῃ ἄζυμα, καθάπερ ἐντέταλμαί σοι, εἰς τὸν καιρὸν ἐν
μηνὶ τῶν νέων· ἐν γὰρ τῷ μηνὶ τῶν νέων ἐξῆλθες ἐξ Αἰγύπτου.
Πᾶν διανοῖγον μήτραν ἐμοί, τὰ ἀρσενικά, πρωτότοκον μόσχου, καὶ 19
πρωτότοκον προβάτου. Καὶ πρωτότοκον ὑποζυγίου λυτρώσῃ προ- 20
βάτῳ· ἐὰν δὲ μὴ λυτρώσῃ, τιμὴν δώσεις αὐτοῦ. Πᾶν πρωτότοκον
τῶν υἱῶν σου λυτρώσῃ· οὐκ ὀφθήσῃ ἐνώπιόν μου κενός. Ἕξ ἡ- 21
μέρας ἐργᾷ, τῇ δὲ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ καταπαύσεις· τῷ σπόρῳ καὶ
τῷ ἀμητῷ καταπαύσεις. Καὶ ἑορτὴν ἑβδομάδων ποιήσεις μοι, ἀρ- 22
χὴν θερισμοῦ πυρῶν· καὶ ἑορτὴν συναγωγῆς μεσοῦντος τοῦ ἐνιαυ-
τοῦ. Τρεῖς καιροὺς τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ ὀφθήσεται πᾶν ἀρσενικόν σου 23
ἐνώπιον Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ Ἰσραήλ. Ὅταν γὰρ ἐκβαλῶ τὰ ἔθνη 24
ἀπὸ προσώπου σου, καὶ ἐμπλατυνῶ τὰ ὅριά σου, οὐκ ἐπιθυμήσει
οὐδεὶς τῆς γῆς σου, ἡνίκα ἐὰν ἀναβαίνῃς ὀφθῆναι ἐναντίον Κυρίου
τοῦ Θεοῦ σου, τρεῖς καιροὺς τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ. Οὐ σφάξεις ἐπὶ ζύμῃ 25

### English Translation

**Chapter 34**

... our sins and our iniquities, and we shall be Thine.

<sup>10</sup> And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, I do make a covenant before all thy people: I will do glorious things, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation. And all the people, among whom thou art, shall behold the works of the Lord; for wonderful are the things which I shall do unto thee.
<sup>11</sup> Take heed thou unto all that which I command thee this day. Behold, I do cast out from before thy face the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite.
<sup>12</sup> Take heed unto thyself, lest at any time thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, into which thou dost enter into it, lest it become a stumbling-block in your midst.
<sup>13</sup> Their altars ye shall tear down, and their pillars ye shall break in pieces, and their groves ye shall cut down, and the graven images of their gods ye shall burn with fire.
<sup>14</sup> For ye shall by no means worship any other god; for the Lord thy God, His Name is Jealous, a Jealous God is He.
<sup>15</sup> Lest at any time thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go whoring after their gods, and sacrifice unto their gods; and they call thee, and thou eatest of their sacrifices;
<sup>16</sup> And thou take of their daughters for thy sons, and of thy daughters thou give unto their sons, and thy daughters go whoring after their gods, and thy sons go whoring after their gods.
<sup>17</sup> And molten gods thou shalt not make for thyself.
<sup>18</sup> And the Feast of Unleavened Bread shalt thou keep: seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread, even as I have commanded thee, at the appointed season in the month of new [things]; for in the month of new [things] thou didst come forth from Egypt.
<sup>19</sup> Every male that openeth the womb [is] Mine; the firstborn of a calf, and the firstborn of a sheep.
<sup>20</sup> And the firstborn of an ass shalt thou redeem with a sheep; but if thou redeem it not, thou shalt give its price. Every firstborn of thy sons shalt thou redeem; thou shalt not appear empty before My face.
<sup>21</sup> Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest; in the time of sowing and in the time of harvest, thou shalt rest.
<sup>22</sup> And the Feast of Weeks shalt thou keep unto Me, the beginning of the wheat harvest; and the Feast of Ingathering, [even] when the year is midway.
<sup>23</sup> Three times in the year shall all thy males appear before the Lord God of Israel.
<sup>24</sup> For when I shall cast out the nations from before thy face, and shall enlarge thy borders, no man shall covet thy land, whensoever thou goest up to appear before the Lord thy God, three times in the year.
<sup>25</sup> Thou shalt not sacrifice upon leaven.
