νοντα δίδραχμα δώσει τῷ κυρίῳ αὐτῶν, καὶ ὁ ταῦρος λιθοβολη-
33 θήσεται. Ἐὰν δέ τις ἀνοίξῃ λάκκον, ἢ λατομήσῃ λάκκον, καὶ μὴ
34 καλύψῃ αὐτόν, καὶ ἐμπέσῃ ἐκεῖ μόσχος ἢ ὄνος, ὁ κύριος τοῦ λάκκου
ἀποτίσει, ἀργύριον δώσει τῷ κυρίῳ αὐτῶν τὸ δὲ τεθνηκὸς
35 αὐτῷ ἔσται. Ἐὰν δὲ κερατίσῃ τινὸς ταῦρος τὸν ταῦρον τοῦ πλησίον
αὐτοῦ, καὶ τελευτήσῃ, ἀποδώσονται τὸν ταῦρον τὸν ζῶντα,
καὶ διελῶνται τὸ ἀργύριον αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὸν ταῦρον τὸν τεθνηκότα
36 διελῶνται. Ἐὰν δὲ γνωρίζηται ὁ ταῦρος ὅτι κερατιστής ἐστι πρὸ
τῆς ἐχθὲς καὶ πρὸ τῆς τρίτης, καὶ διαμεμαρτυρημένοι ὦσι τῷ κυρίῳ
αὐτοῦ, καὶ μὴ ἀφανίσῃ αὐτόν, ἀποτίσει ταῦρον ἀντὶ ταύρου·
ὁ δὲ τετελευτηκὼς αὐτῷ ἔσται.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΒ΄. XXII.

1 Ἐὰν δέ τις κλέψῃ μόσχον ἢ πρόβατον, καὶ σφάξῃ αὐτό, ἢ
ἀποδῶται, πέντε μόσχους ἀποτίσει ἀντὶ τοῦ μόσχου, καὶ τέσσαρα
2 πρόβατα ἀντὶ τοῦ προβάτου. Ἐὰν δὲ ἐν τῷ διορύγματι εὑρεθῇ
3 ὁ κλέπτης, καὶ πληγεὶς ἀποθάνῃ, οὐκ ἔστιν αὐτῷ φόνος· ἐὰν δὲ
ἀνατείλῃ ὁ ἥλιος ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ, ἔνοχός ἐστιν, ἀνταποθανεῖται. Ἐὰν δὲ
4 μὴ ὑπάρχῃ αὐτῷ, πραθήτω ἀντὶ τοῦ κλέμματος αὐτοῦ. Ἐὰν δὲ
καταλειφθῇ, καὶ εὑρεθῇ ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ τὸ κλέμμα ἀπὸ μόσχου
5 καὶ ὄνου ἕως προβάτου ζῶντα, διπλᾶ ἀποτίσει. Ἐὰν δὲ καταβο-
σκήσῃ τις ἀγρὸν ἢ ἀμπελῶνα, καὶ ἀφῇ τὸ κτῆνος αὐτοῦ καταβο-
σκῆσαι ἀγρὸν ἕτερον, ἀποτίσει ἐκ τοῦ ἀγροῦ αὐτοῦ κατὰ τὸ γέννημα
αὐτοῦ· ἐὰν δὲ πάντα τὸν ἀγρὸν καταβοσκήσῃ, τὰ βέλτιστα
τοῦ ἀγροῦ αὐτοῦ ἢ τὰ βέλτιστα τοῦ ἀμπελῶνος αὐτοῦ ἀποτίσει.
6 Ἐὰν δὲ ἐξελθὸν πῦρ εὕρῃ ἀκάνθας, καὶ προσεμπρήσῃ ἄλωνα ἢ
στάχυς ἢ πεδίον, ἀποτίσει ὁ τὸ πῦρ ἐκκαύσας. Ἐὰν δέ τις δῷ
7 τῷ πλησίον ἀργύριον ἢ σκεύη φυλάξαι, καὶ κλαπῇ ἐκ τῆς οἰκίας
8 τοῦ ἀνθρώπου, ἐὰν εὑρεθῇ ὁ κλέψας, ἀποτίσει διπλοῦν· ἐὰν δὲ μὴ
εὑρεθῇ ὁ κλέψας, προσελεύσεται ὁ κύριος τῆς οἰκίας ἐνώπιον τοῦ
Θεοῦ, καὶ ὀμεῖται, ἢ μὴν μὴ αὐτὸν πεπονηρεῦσθαι ἐφ᾿ ὅλης τῆς
9 παρακαταθήκης τοῦ πλησίον. Κατὰ πᾶν ῥητὸν ἀδίκημα, περί τε
μόσχου, καὶ ὑποζυγίου, καὶ προβάτου, καὶ ἱματίου, καὶ πάσης
ἀπωλείας τῆς ἐγκαλουμένης, ὅ,τι οὖν ἐὰν ᾖ, ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ
ἐλεύσεται ἡ κρίσις ἀμφοτέρων, καὶ ὁ ἁλοὺς διὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ, ἀπο-

#### EXODUS CHAPTER XXI

32 ...shall he give two drachmas unto their master, and the ox shall be stoned.
33 And if any man open a pit, or dig a pit, and shall not
34 cover it, and a calf or an ass fall therein, the owner of the pit shall surely pay; he shall give silver unto their master, and the dead [beast] shall be his own.
35 And if one's ox gore his neighbour's ox, and it die, they shall render the living ox, and they shall divide the silver thereof, and the dead ox also shall they divide.
36 But if it be known that the ox was a gorer before yesterday and before the third [day], and they have testified unto its master, and he hath not restrained it, he shall surely pay an ox for an ox; and the one that hath died shall be his own.

#### CHAPTER XXII

1 If a man shall steal a calf or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it, he shall pay five calves for the calf, and four sheep for the sheep.
2 If the thief be found in the breaking in [of a house], and being smitten he die, there is no blood-guiltiness for him.
3 But if the sun rise upon him, he is guilty; he shall surely die. If he have nothing, let him be sold for his theft.
4 And if it remain [with him], and be found in his hand, the stolen thing, from calf and ass even unto sheep, alive, he shall restore double.
5 If any man cause a field or a vineyard to be grazed, and release his beast to graze another field, he shall pay from his own field according to its produce. But if it graze the whole field, he shall pay the best of his field or the best of his vineyard.
6 If fire go forth and find thorns, and set on fire a threshing-floor, or ears of corn, or a field, he that hath kindled the fire shall surely pay.
7 If a man give unto his neighbour money or vessels to keep, and it be stolen out of the man's house:
8 If the thief be found, he shall pay double. But if the thief be not found, the master of the house shall come before God, and shall swear, that he hath verily wrought no evil upon the whole deposit of his neighbour.
9 In every matter of wrongdoing, concerning ox, and beast of burden, and sheep, and garment, and every loss that is claimed, whatsoever it may be, the judgment of both shall come before God; and he that is found guilty by God, shall pay
