αὐτήν, καὶ ἔκοψαν ἐκεῖθεν κλῆμα καὶ βότρυν σταφυλῆς ἕνα ἀπ᾿
αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἦρον αὐτὸν ἐπ᾿ ἀναφορεῦσι δυσίν, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ῥοῶν, καὶ
25 ἀπὸ τῶν συκῶν. Τὸν τόπον ἐκεῖνον ἐπωνόμασαν Φάραγγε βότρυος,
26 διὰ τὸν βότρυν ὃν ἔκοψαν ἐκεῖθεν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν
ἐκεῖθεν κατασκεψάμενοι τὴν γῆν μετὰ τεσσαράκοντα ἡμέρας.
27 Καὶ πορευθέντες ἦλθον πρὸς Μωυσῆν καὶ Ἀαρὼν καὶ πρὸς πᾶσαν
συναγωγὴν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, εἰς τὴν ἔρημον Φαρὰν Κάδης· καὶ ἀπεκρίθησαν
αὐτοῖς ῥῆμα καὶ πάσῃ τῇ συναγωγῇ, καὶ ἔδειξαν αὐτοῖς τὸν καρπὸν
τῆς γῆς,
28 καὶ διηγήσαντο αὐτῷ, καὶ εἶπαν· Ἤλθομεν εἰς τὴν γῆν, εἰς ἣν ἀπέστειλας
ἡμᾶς, γῆν ῥέουσαν γάλα καὶ μέλι, καὶ οὗτος ὁ καρπὸς αὐτῆς·
29 ἀλλ᾿ ᾗ ἔτι θρασὺ τὸ ἔθνος τὸ κατοικοῦν τὴν γῆν, καὶ αἱ πόλεις ὀχυραὶ
τετειχισμέναι μεγάλαι σφόδρα, καὶ τὴν γενεὰν Ἐνὰκ ἑωράκαμεν ἐκεῖ.
30 Καὶ Ἀμαλὴκ κατοικεῖ ἐν τῇ γῇ πρὸς νότον· καὶ ὁ Χετταῖος, καὶ ὁ
Εὐαῖος, καὶ ὁ Ἰεβουσαῖος, καὶ ὁ Ἀμοῤῥαῖος κατοικεῖ ἐν τῇ ὀρεινῇ·
καὶ ὁ Χαναναῖος κατοικεῖ παρὰ θάλασσαν, καὶ παρὰ τὸν Ἰορδάνην
(ποταμόν).
31 Καὶ κατεσιώπησε Χάλεβ τὸν λαὸν πρὸς Μωυσῆν, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ·
οὐχί, ἀλλὰ ἀναβάντες ἀναβησόμεθα, καὶ κατακληρονομήσομεν αὐτήν,
ὅτι δυνατοὶ δυνησόμεθα πρὸς αὐτούς.
32 Καὶ οἱ ἄνθρωποι οἱ συναναβάντες μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, εἶπαν· οὐκ ἀναβαίνομεν,
ὅτι οὐ μὴ δυνώμεθα ἀναβῆναι πρὸς τὸ ἔθνος, ὅτι ἰσχυρότερόν
ἐστιν ἡμῶν μᾶλλον.
33 Καὶ ἐξήνεγκαν ἔνστασιν τῆς γῆς, ἣν κατεσκέψαντο αὐτήν, πρὸς τοὺς
υἱοὺς Ἰσραήλ, λέγοντες· τὴν γῆν ἣν παρήλθομεν αὐτὴν κατασκέψασθαι
αὐτήν, γῆ κατέδουσα τοὺς κατοικοῦντας ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς ἐστι, καὶ πᾶς ὁ
λαὸς ὃν ἑωράκαμεν ἐν αὐτῇ, ἄνδρες ὑπερμήκεις·
34 καὶ ἐκεῖ ἑωράκαμεν τοὺς γίγαντας υἱοὺς Ἐνὰκ ἐκ τῶν γιγάντων, καὶ
ἦμεν ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν ὡσεὶ ἀκρίδες· ἀλλὰ καὶ οὕτως ἦμεν ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν.

1 ΚΑΙ ἀναλαβοῦσα πᾶσα ἡ συναγωγή, ἔδωκε φωνὴν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔκλαιεν
ὁ λαὸς ὅλην τὴν νύκτα ἐκείνην·
2 καὶ διεγόγγυζον ἐπὶ Μωυσῆν καὶ Ἀαρὼν πάντες οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ
εἶπαν πρὸς αὐτοὺς πᾶσα ἡ συναγωγή· Ὄφελον ἀπεθάνομεν ἐν γῇ
Αἰγύπτῳ, ἢ ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ ταύτῃ εἰ ἀπεθάνομεν·
3 καὶ ἵνατί Κύριος εἰσάγει ἡμᾶς εἰς τὴν γῆν

NUMBERS CHAPTER XIII.

that very [branch]. And they cut down from thence a branch, even one cluster of grapes, and they bore it upon two [men] with a pole; and [they took] of the pomegranates, and of the figs.
25 That place they named Pharange Botryos,
26 by reason of the cluster which the sons of Israel cut down from thence. And they returned from spying out the land after forty days.
27 And when they were gone, they came unto Moses and unto Aaron and unto all the congregation of the sons of Israel, into the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and they brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and they showed them the fruit of the land,
28 and they reported unto him, and said, "We came unto the land, into which Thou didst send us, a land flowing with milk and honey; and this is its fruit.
29 Howbeit, the nation that dwelleth in the land is yet strong, and the cities are fortified, walled, and exceeding great; and there have we seen the generation of Anak.
30 And Amalek dwelleth in the land toward the south; and the Hittite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, and the Amorite dwell in the mountainous region; and the Canaanite dwelleth beside the sea, and beside the Jordan (river)."
31 And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said unto him, "Nay, but let us surely go up, and we shall surely inherit it; for we shall surely be able to prevail against them."
32 But the men that went up with him said, "We are not able to go up against the nation; for it is far stronger than we."
33 And they brought forth an evil report concerning the land, which they had spied out, unto the sons of Israel, saying, "The land, which we passed through it to spy it out, [even it], is a land that devoureth its inhabitants; and all the people whom we have seen therein are men of exceeding stature.
34 And there have we seen the giants, the sons of Anak, [who were] of the giants; and in their sight were we as grasshoppers; yea, and even so were we in their sight."

CHAPTER XIV.

1 AND all the congregation lifted up their voice, and the people wept all that night.
2 And all the sons of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron; and all the congregation said unto them, "Would that we had died in the land of Egypt! Or, if only we had died in this wilderness!
3 And wherefore doth the Lord bring us into this land,
