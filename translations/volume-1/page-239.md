9 ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς, καὶ αὐξανῶ ὑμᾶς, καὶ πληθυνῶ ὑμᾶς, καὶ στήσω τὴν
10 διαθήκην μου μεθ’ ὑμῶν. Καὶ φάγεσθε παλαιὰ καὶ παλαιὰ πα-
11 λαιῶν, καὶ παλαιὰ ἐκ προσώπου νέων ἐξορίσετε. Καὶ θήσω τὴν
12 διαθήκην μου ἐν ὑμῖν, καὶ οὐ βδελύξεται ἡ ψυχή μου ὑμᾶς· καὶ
ἔμπεριπατήσω ἐν ὑμῖν, καὶ ἔσομαι ὑμῶν Θεός, καὶ ὑμεῖς ἔσεσθε
13 μου λαός. Ἐγὼ (εἰμὶ) Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν, ὁ ἐξαγαγὼν ὑμᾶς
ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, ὄντων ὑμῶν δούλων, καὶ συνέτριψα τὸν δεσμὸν
14 τοῦ ζυγοῦ ὑμῶν, καὶ ἤγαγον ὑμᾶς μετὰ παῤῥησίας. Ἐὰν δὲ μὴ
15 ὑπακούσητέ μου, μηδὲ ποιήσητε τὰ προστάγματά μου ταῦτα, ἀλλὰ
ἀπειθήσητε αὐτοῖς, καὶ τοῖς κρίμασί μου προσοχθίσῃ ἡ ψυχή ὑμῶν,
ὥστε (ὑμᾶς) μὴ ποιεῖν πάσας τὰς ἐντολάς μου, ὥστε διασκεδά-
16 σαι ὑμᾶς τὴν διαθήκην μου, καὶ ἐγὼ ποιήσω οὕτως ὑμῖν, καὶ
ἐπισυστήσω ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς τὴν ἀπορίαν, τήν τε ψώραν, καὶ τὸν ἔκτε-
ρον, καὶ σφακελίζοντας τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς ὑμῶν, καὶ τὴν ψυχὴν
ὑμῶν ἐκτήκουσαν· καὶ σπερεῖτε διακενῆς τὰ σπέρματα ὑμῶν, καὶ
17 ἔδονται αὐτὰ οἱ ὑπεναντίοι ὑμῶν. Καὶ ἐπιστήσω τὸ πρόσωπόν μου
ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς, καὶ πεσεῖσθε ἐναντίον τῶν ἐχθρῶν ὑμῶν, καὶ διώξον-
ται ὑμᾶς οἱ μισοῦντες ὑμᾶς, καὶ φεύξεσθε οὐδενὸς διώκοντος ὑ-
18 μᾶς. Καὶ ἐὰν ἕως τούτου μὴ ὑπακούσητέ μου, καὶ προσθήσω
19 παιδεῦσαι ὑμᾶς ἑπτάκις ἐπὶ ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις ὑμῶν· καὶ συντρίψω
τὴν ὕβριν τῆς ὑπερηφανίας ὑμῶν, καὶ θήσω τὸν οὐρανὸν ὑμῖν ὡς
20 σιδηροῦν, καὶ τὴν γῆν ὑμῶν ὡσεὶ χαλκῆν· καὶ ἔσται εἰς κενὸν
ἡ ἰσχὺς ὑμῶν, καὶ οὐ δώσει ἡ γῆ ὑμῶν τὸν σπόρον αὐτῆς, καὶ
21 τὸ ξύλον τοῦ ἀγροῦ ὑμῶν οὐ δώσει τὸν καρπὸν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐὰν
μετὰ ταῦτα πορεύσησθε πλάγιοι, καὶ μὴ βούλησθε ὑπακούειν μου,
22 προσθήσω ὑμῖν πληγὰς ἑπτὰ κατὰ τὰς ἁμαρτίας ὑμῶν· καὶ ἀπο-
στελῶ ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς τὰ θηρία (τὰ ἄγρια) τῆς γῆς, καὶ κατέδεται ὑμᾶς,
καὶ ἐξαναλώσει τὰ κτήνη ὑμῶν, καὶ ὀλιγοστοὺς ποιήσει ὑμᾶς, καὶ
23 ἐρημωθήσονται αἱ ὁδοὶ ὑμῶν. Καὶ ἐπὶ τούτοις ἐὰν μὴ παιδευ-
24 θῆτε, ἀλλὰ πορεύσησθε πρός με πλάγιοι, πορεύσομαι κἀγὼ μεθ’
ὑμῶν θυμῷ πλαγίῳ, καὶ πατάξω ὑμᾶς κἀγὼ ἑπτάκις ἀντὶ τῶν
25 ἁμαρτιῶν ὑμῶν. Καὶ ἐπάξω ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς μάχαιραν ἐκδικοῦσαν δίκην
διαθήκης, καὶ καταφεύξεσθε εἰς τὰς πόλεις ὑμῶν· καὶ ἐξαποστε-
26 λῶ θάνατον εἰς ὑμᾶς, καὶ παραδοθήσεσθε εἰς χεῖρας ἐχθρῶν· εἰς
τὸ θλῖψαι ὑμᾶς σιτοδείαν ἄρτων, καὶ πέψουσι δέκα γυναῖκες τοὺς
ἄρτους ὑμῶν ἐν κλιβάνῳ ἑνί, καὶ ἀποδώσουσι τοὺς ἄρτους ὑμῶν

**LEVITICUS CHAPTER 26**

9 upon you; and I will cause you to increase, and I will multiply you, and I will establish My covenant with you.
10 And ye shall eat of old store, yea, and old things of ancient store; and the old, from before the new, shall ye remove.
11 And I will set My covenant among you, and My soul shall not abhor you;
12 and I will walk among you, and I will be your God, and ye shall be My people.
13 I [am] the Lord your God, Who brought you forth from the land of Egypt, while ye were bondmen; and I broke the bond of your yoke, and I brought you out with freedom.

14 But if ye hearken not unto Me, nor perform these My statutes,
15 but disobey them; and if your soul abhor My judgments, so that [ye] perform not all My commandments, and so that ye break My covenant;
16 then I also will do this unto you: I will bring upon you distress, both the scab and the wasting disease, causing your eyes to fail, and your soul to languish; and ye shall sow your seeds in vain,
17 for your adversaries shall eat them. And I will set My face against you, and ye shall fall before your enemies; and they that hate you shall pursue you, and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.
18 And if, for all this, ye will not hearken unto Me, then I will add to chastise you seven times more for your sins.
19 And I will break the insolence of your pride, and I will make your heaven as iron, and your land as bronze.
20 And your strength shall be spent in vain; and your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the tree of your field yield its fruit.
21 And if after these things ye walk perversely, and are unwilling to obey Me,
22 then I will add unto you seven plagues according to your sins; and I will send upon you the wild beasts of the earth, and they shall devour you, and consume your cattle, and make you few in number; and your roads shall be desolate.
23 And if for these things ye be not chastened, but walk perversely toward Me,
24 then I also will walk with you in perverse wrath, and I also will strike you seven times more for your sins.
25 And I will bring upon you a sword avenging the justice of the covenant; and ye shall flee into your cities; and I will send forth death among you, and ye shall be delivered into the hands of your enemies;
26 to afflict you with a scarcity of bread; and ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver your bread
