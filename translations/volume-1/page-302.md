ΚΕΦ. ΚΖ΄. ΑΡΙΘΜΟΙ 287
δῶσιν αὐτῷ ἀδελφοί, δώσετε τὴν κληρονομίαν αὐτοῦ τῷ ἀδελφῷ
τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ. Ἐὰν δὲ μὴ ὦσιν ἀδελφοὶ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ, 11
δώσετε τὴν κληρονομίαν αὐτοῦ τῷ οἰκείῳ τῷ ἔγγιστα αὐτοῦ ἐκ τῆς
φυλῆς αὐτοῦ, κληρονομῆσαι τὰ αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἔσται τοῦτο τοῖς υἱοῖς
Ἰσραὴλ δικαίωμα κρίσεως, καθὰ συνέταξε Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ. Καὶ 12
εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν· ἀνάβηθι εἰς τὸ ὄρος, τὸ ἐν τῷ πέραν
τοῦτο· ὄρος Ναβαῦ, καὶ ἴδε τὴν γῆν Χαναάν, ἣν ἐγὼ δίδωμι τοῖς
υἱοῖς Ἰσραὴλ ἐν κατασχέσει, καὶ ὄψῃ αὐτήν, καὶ προστεθήσῃ πρὸς 13
τὸν λαόν σου καὶ σύ, καθὰ προσετέθη Ἀαρὼν ὁ ἀδελφός σου ἐν
Ὡρ τῷ ὄρει· διότι παρέβητε τὸ ἔρημά μου ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ Σίν, ἐν τῷ 14
ἀντιπίπτειν τὴν συναγωγήν, τοῦ ἁγιάσαι με, οὐχ ἡγιάσατέ με ἐπὶ
τῷ ὕδατι ἐναντίον αὐτῶν· τοῦτο δέ ἐστι τὸ ὕδωρ ἀντιλογίας Κά-
δες ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ Σίν. Καὶ εἶπε Μωυσῆς πρὸς Κύριον, λέγων· 15
Ἐπισκεψάσθω Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τῶν πνευμάτων καὶ πάσης σαρκὸς ἄν- 16
θρωπον ἐπὶ τῆς συναγωγῆς ταύτης, ὅστις ἐξελεύσεται πρὸ προσώ- 17
που αὐτῶν, καὶ ὅστις εἰσελεύσεται πρὸ προσώπου αὐτῶν, καὶ
ὅστις ἐξάξει αὐτούς, καὶ ὅστις εἰσάξει αὐτούς, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ἡ
συναγωγὴ Κυρίου, ὡς πρόβατα οἷς οὐκ ἔστι ποιμήν. Καὶ ἐλάλησε 18
Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, λέγων· λάβε πρὸς σεαυτὸν τὸν Ἰησοῦν υἱὸν
Ναυῆ, ἄνθρωπον ὃς ἔχει πνεῦμα ἐν ἑαυτῷ, καὶ ἐπιθήσεις τὰς χεῖ-
ράς σου ἐπ᾿ αὐτόν· καὶ στήσεις αὐτὸν ἔναντι Ἐλεάζαρ τοῦ ἱερέως, 19
καὶ (ἐντελῇ αὐτῷ) ἐναντίον πάσης συναγωγῆς, καὶ ἐντελεῖαι περὶ
αὐτοῦ ἐναντίον αὐτῶν· καὶ δώσεις τῆς δόξης σου ἐπ᾿ αὐτόν, ὅπως 20
ἂν εἰσακούσωσιν αὐτοῦ οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἔναντι Ἐλεάζαρ τοῦ ἱε- 21
ρέως στήσεται, καὶ ἐπερωτήσουσιν αὐτὸν τὴν κρίσιν τῶν δήλων ἔν-
αντι Κυρίου· ἐπὶ τῷ στόματι αὐτοῦ ἐξελεύσονται, καὶ ἐπὶ τῷ στό-
ματι αὐτοῦ εἰσελεύσονται αὐτὸς καὶ πάντες οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ὁμο-
θυμαδόν, καὶ πᾶσα ἡ συναγωγή. Καὶ ἐποίησε Μωυσῆς, καθὰ ἐν- 22
ετείλατο αὐτῷ Κύριος· καὶ λαβὼν τὸν Ἰησοῦν, ἔστησεν αὐτὸν ἔν-
αντι Ἐλεάζαρ τοῦ ἱερέως, καὶ ἐναντίον πάσης συναγωγῆς· καὶ ἐπέ- 23
θηκε τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ ἐπ᾿ αὐτόν, καὶ συνέστησεν αὐτὸν καθάπερ
συνέταξε Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ.

### NUMBERS, CHAPTER 27

10 Should brothers give unto him, ye shall convey his inheritance to the brother of his father.
11 But if there be no brothers of his father, then ye shall give his inheritance to his kinsman, the nearest to him, of his tribe, that he may inherit his possessions; and this shall be unto the children of Israel a statute of judgment, even as the Lord commanded Moses.

12 And the Lord spake unto Moses: Ascend now unto the mountain, this one which is beyond, [even] Mount Nebo; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession.
13 And thou shalt see it, and thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people, even as Aaron thy brother was gathered in Mount Hor;
14 because ye transgressed My desolation in the wilderness of Zin, when the congregation rebelled, that ye should sanctify Me, yet ye sanctified Me not at the water before their eyes. (And this is the water of strife [at] Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.)

15 And Moses said unto the Lord, saying:
16 Let the Lord, the God of the spirits and of all flesh, appoint a man over this congregation,
17 who shall go out before them, and who shall come in before them, and who shall lead them out, and who shall bring them in, lest the congregation of the Lord be as sheep which have no shepherd.

18 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying: Take unto thyself Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and thou shalt lay thine hands upon him;
19 and thou shalt set him before Eleazar the priest, and thou shalt charge him before all the congregation; and Eleazar shall be charged concerning him before them;
20 and thou shalt put of thine honor upon him, that the children of Israel may hearken unto him.
21 And before Eleazar the priest shall he stand, and they shall ask him for the judgment of the Urim before the Lord; at his mouth shall they go out, and at his mouth shall they come in, he and all the children of Israel with one accord, and all the congregation.

22 And Moses did as the Lord commanded him; and having taken Joshua, he set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation;
23 and he laid his hands upon him, and commissioned him even as the Lord commanded Moses.
