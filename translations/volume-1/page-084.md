Ἐγένετο δὲ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ, κατέβη Ἰούδας ἀπὸ τῶν 1
ἀδελφῶν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ᾤχετο ἕως πρὸς ἄνθρωπόν τινα Ὀδολλαμεῖ-
την, ᾧ ὄνομα Εἰράς. Καὶ ἴδεν ἐκεῖ Ἰούδας θυγατέρα ἀνθρώπου 2
Χαναναίου, ᾗ ὄνομα Σαυά· καὶ ἔλαβεν αὐτήν, καὶ εἰσῆλθε πρὸς
αὐτήν. Καὶ συλλαβοῦσα ἔτεκεν υἱόν, καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸ ὄνομα αὐ- 3
τοῦ, Ἤρ. Καὶ συλλαβοῦσα ἔτι, ἔτεκεν υἱόν, καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸ ὄ- 4
νομα αὐτοῦ, Αὐνάν. Καὶ προσθεῖσα ἔτι, ἔτεκεν υἱόν, καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸ ὄ- 5
νομα αὐτοῦ, Σηλώμ· αὕτη δὲ ἦν ἐν Χασβί, ἡνίκα ἔτεκεν αὐτούς.
Καὶ ἔλαβεν Ἰούδας γυναῖκα Ἤρ τῷ πρωτοτόκῳ αὐτοῦ, ᾗ ὄνομα 6
Θάμαρ. Ἐγένετο δὲ Ἤρ πρωτότοκος Ἰούδα πονηρὸς ἐναντίον Κυ- 7
ρίου· καὶ ἀπέκτεινεν αὐτὸν ὁ Θεός. Εἶπε δὲ Ἰούδας τῷ Αὐνάν· 8
εἴσελθε πρὸς τὴν γυναῖκα τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου, καὶ γάμβρευσαι αὐτήν,
καὶ ἀνάστησον σπέρμα τῷ ἀδελφῷ σου. Γνοὺς δὲ Αὐνάν, ὅτι οὐχ 9
αὐτῷ ἔσται τὸ σπέρμα, ἐγένετο ὅταν εἰσήρχετο πρὸς τὴν γυναῖκα
τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ, ἐξέχεεν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, τοῦ μὴ δοῦναι σπέρμα
τῷ ἀδελφῷ αὐτοῦ. Πονηρὸν δὲ ἐφάνη τὸ ῥῆμα ἐναντίον τοῦ Θεοῦ, 10
ὅτι ἐποίησε τοῦτο· καὶ ἐθανάτωσε καὶ τοῦτον. Εἶπε δὲ Ἰούδας 11
Θάμαρ τῇ νύμφῃ αὐτοῦ· κάθου χήρα ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ πατρός σου,
ἕως μέγας γένηται Σηλὼμ ὁ υἱός μου. Εἶπε γάρ· μή ποτε ἀποθά-
νῃ καὶ οὗτος, ὥσπερ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ. Ἀπελθοῦσα δὲ Θάμαρ, ἐκά-
θητο ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ πατρός αὐτῆς. Ἐπληθύνθησαν δὲ αἱ ἡμέραι, 12
καὶ ἀπέθανε Σαυά ἡ γυνὴ Ἰούδα· καὶ παρακληθεὶς Ἰούδας, ἀνέ-
βη ἐπὶ τοὺς κείροντας τὰ πρόβατα αὐτοῦ, αὐτὸς καὶ Εἰρὰς ὁ ποι-
μὴν αὐτοῦ ὁ Ὀδολλαμείτης, εἰς Θαμνά. Καὶ ἀπηγγέλη Θάμαρ 13
τῇ νύμφῃ αὐτοῦ, λέγοντες· Ἰδοὺ ὁ πενθερός σου ἀνέβη εἰς Θα-
μνά, κεῖραι τὰ πρόβατα αὐτοῦ. Καὶ περιελομένη τὰ ἱμάτια τῆς 14
χηρεύσεως αὐτῆς ἀφ᾿ ἑαυτῆς, περιεβάλετο θερίστρῳ, καὶ ἐκαλλωπί-
σατο, καὶ ἐκάθισε πρὸς ταῖς πύλαις Αἰνάν, ᾗ ἐστιν ἐν παρόδῳ
Θαμνά· ἴδε γὰρ ὅτι μέγας γέγονε Σηλὼμ ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ, αὐτὸς δὲ οὐκ
ἔδωκεν αὐτὴν αὐτῷ γυναῖκα. Καὶ ἰδὼν αὐτὴν Ἰούδας, ἔδοξεν αὐ- 15
τὴν πόρνην εἶναι· κατεκαλύψατο γὰρ τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτῆς, καὶ οὐκ
ἐπέγνω αὐτήν. Ἐξέκλινε δὲ πρὸς αὐτὴν τὴν ὁδόν, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ· 16
Ἐάσῃς με εἰσελθεῖν πρὸς σέ· οὐ γὰρ ἔγνω, ὅτι ἡ νύμφη αὐτοῦ

**GENESIS**
**Chapter XXXVIII**

¹ Now it came to pass in that season, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned aside unto a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah. ² And there Judah saw a daughter of a Canaanite man, whose name was Shua; and he took her [as his wife], and went in unto her. ³ And she conceived and bare a son, and she called his name Er. ⁴ And she conceived yet again, and bare a son, and she called his name Onan. ⁵ And she again added [to conceive], and bare a son, and she called his name Shelah. Now she was in Chezib when she bare them.

⁶ And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar. ⁷ And Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the Lord, and God slew him. ⁸ Then said Judah unto Onan, "Go in unto thy brother’s wife, and perform the duty of a husband’s brother unto her, and raise up seed to thy brother." ⁹ And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother’s wife, that he poured it out upon the ground, lest he should give seed to his brother. ¹⁰ And the thing which he did was evil in the sight of God, because he did this; and He slew him also. ¹¹ Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter-in-law, "Remain a widow in thy father’s house, till Shelah my son be grown." For he said, "Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did." So Tamar went and dwelt in her father’s house.

¹² And in process of time, Shua, Judah’s wife, died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers, he and his shepherd Hirah the Adullamite, to Timnah. ¹³ And it was told unto Tamar his daughter-in-law, saying, "Behold, thy father-in-law goeth up to Timnah to shear his sheep." ¹⁴ And she put off from herself the garments of her widowhood, and covered herself with a veil, and adorned herself, and sat at the gates of Enaim, which is by the highway toward Timnah; for she saw that Shelah her son was grown, and he had not given her to him [as] wife. ¹⁵ And when Judah saw her, he supposed her to be an harlot; for she had covered her face, and he knew her not. ¹⁶ And he turned unto her by the way, and said unto her, "Permit me, I pray thee, to come in unto thee;" for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law.
