32 ἐν μέλιτι. Εἶπε δὲ Μωυσῆς· τοῦτο τὸ ῥῆμα, ὃ συνέταξε Κύριος·
    πλήσατε τὸ γομὸρ τοῦ Μὰν εἰς ἀποθήκην εἰς τὰς γενεὰς ὑμῶν,
    ἵνα ἴδωσι τὸν ἄρτον ὃν ἐφάγετε ὑμεῖς ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, ὡς ἐξήγαγεν
33 ὑμᾶς Κύριος ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου. Καὶ εἶπε Μωυσῆς πρὸς Ἀαρών·
    λάβς στάμνον χρυσοῦν ἕνα, καὶ ἔμβαλε εἰς αὐτὸν πλῆρες τὸ Γο-
    μὸρ τοῦ Μὰν, καὶ ἀποθήσεις αὐτὸ ἐναντίον τοῦ Θεοῦ εἰς διατή-
34 ρησιν εἰς τὰς γενεὰς ὑμῶν. Ὃν τρόπον συνέταξε Κύριος τῷ Μωυ-
    σῇ, καὶ ἀπέθετο Ἀαρὼν ἐναντίον τοῦ μαρτυρίου εἰς διατήρησιν.
35 Οἱ δὲ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἔφαγον τὸ Μάννα ἔτη τεσσαράκοντα, ἕως ἦλ-
    θον εἰς γῆν οἰκουμένην· τὸ Μὰν ἔφαγον, ἕως παρεγένοντο εἰς μέ-
36 ρος τῆς Φοινίκης. Τὸ δὲ γομὸρ τὸ δέκατον τῶν τριῶν μέτρων ἦν.

1   ΚΑὶ ἀπῆρε πᾶσα συναγωγὴ υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ ἐκ τῆς ἐρήμου Σὶν
    κατὰ παρεμβολὰς αὐτῶν, διὰ ῥήματος Κυρίου, καὶ παρενέβαλλον
2   ἐν Ῥαφιδεὶν· οὐκ ἦν δὲ ὕδωρ τῷ λαῷ πιεῖν. Καὶ ἐλοιδορεῖτο ὁ
    λαὸς πρὸς Μωυσῆν, καὶ ἔλεγον· δὸς ἡμῖν ὕδωρ, ἵνα πίωμεν. Καὶ
    εἶπεν αὐτοῖς Μωυσῆς· τί λοιδορεῖσθέ μοι, καὶ τί πειράζετε Κύριον;
3   Ἐδίψησε δὲ ἐκεῖ ὁ λαὸς ὕδατι, καὶ ἐγόγγυζεν ὁ λαὸς ἐπὶ Μωυ-
    σῆν, λέγοντες· ἵνατί τοῦτο; ἀνεβίβασας ἡμᾶς ἐξ Αἰγύπτου, ἀπο-
    κτεῖναι ἡμᾶς καὶ τὰ τέκνα ἡμῶν καὶ τὰ κτήνη ἡμῶν τῷ δίψει;
4   Ἐβόησε δὲ Μωυσῆς πρὸς Κύριον, λέγων· τί ποιήσω τῷ λαῷ
5   τούτῳ; ἔτι μικρὸν, καὶ καταλιθοβολήσουσι με. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος
    πρὸς Μωυσῆν· προπορεύου τοῦ λαοῦ, καὶ λάβε μετὰ σεαυτοῦ ἀπὸ
    τῶν πρεσβυτέρων τοῦ λαοῦ· καὶ τὴν ῥάβδον, ἐν ᾗ ἐπάταξας τὸν
6   ποταμὸν, λάβε ἐν τῇ χειρί σου, καὶ πορεύου. Ὥδε ἐγὼ ἔστηκα
    ἐκεῖ πρὸ τοῦ σὲ (ἐλθεῖν) ἐπὶ τῆς πέτρας ἐν Χωρὴβ· καὶ πατάξεις
    τὴν πέτραν, καὶ ἐξελεύσεται ἐξ αὐτῆς ὕδωρ, καὶ πίεται ὁ λαός.
7   Καὶ ἐποίησε Μωυσῆς οὕτως ἐναντίον τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἐ-
    πωνόμασε τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ τόπου ἐκείνου, Πειρασμὸς καὶ Λοιδορησις,
    διὰ τὴν λοιδορίαν τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ διὰ τὸ πειράζειν αὐτοὺς
8   Κύριον, λέγοντες· εἰ ἔστι Κύριος ἐν ἡμῖν, ἢ οὔ. Ἦλθε δὲ Ἀμα-
9   λὴκ, καὶ ἐπολέμει Ἰσραὴλ, ἐν Ῥαφιδείν. Εἶπε δὲ Μωυσῆς τῷ
    Ἰησοῦ· ἐπίλεξον σεαυτῷ ἄνδρας, καὶ ἐξελθὼν παράταξαι τῷ Ἀ-
    μαλὴκ αὔριον· καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἔστηκα ἐπὶ τῆς κορυφῆς τοῦ βουνοῦ,

**EXODUS. Chapter 16.**

**32** in honey. And Moses said, "This is the word which the Lord hath commanded: 'Fill an omer of the manna for a store unto your generations, that they may behold the bread which ye did eat in the wilderness, when the Lord led forth **33** you out of the land of Egypt.'" And Moses said unto Aaron, "[Take] a golden jar, and put therein a full omer of the manna; and thou shalt lay it up before God, for a keeping unto your generations." **34** In the manner which the Lord commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the testimony for a keeping. **35** And the sons of Israel did eat the manna forty years, until they came into an inhabited land. The manna they did eat until they came into a part of Phoenicia. **36** Now the omer was the tenth part of three measures.

**Chapter 17.**

**1** And all the congregation of the sons of Israel departed from the wilderness of Sin, according to their encampments, by the word of the Lord; and they encamped **2** in Rephidim. But there was no water for the people to drink. And the people reviled Moses, and they said, "Give us water, that we may drink." And Moses said unto them, "Why do ye revile me? And why do ye tempt the Lord?" **3** And the people thirsted there for water, and the people murmured against Moses, saying, "Wherefore this? Hast thou brought us up out of Egypt to slay us and our children and our cattle with thirst?" **4** And Moses cried unto the Lord, saying, "What shall I do unto this people? Yet a little while, and they will stone me!" **5** And the Lord said unto Moses, "Go on before the people, and take with thyself some of the elders of the people; and thy rod, wherewith thou didst strike the river, take in thine hand, and go. **6** Behold, I stand there before thee [to come] upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt strike the rock, and water shall come forth from it, and the people shall drink." **7** And Moses did so before the sons of Israel. And he called the name of that place, Temptation and Reviling, because of the reviling of the sons of Israel, and because they did tempt **8** the Lord, saying, "Is the Lord among us, or no?" Then came Amalek, **9** and fought with Israel in Rephidim. And Moses said unto Joshua, "Choose for thyself men, and go out and do battle against Amalek tomorrow. And behold, I shall stand upon the top of the hill,
