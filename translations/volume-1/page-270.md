**Chapter 11**

20 But for twenty days, yea, for a whole month of days shall ye eat [thereof], until it come forth at your nostrils; and it shall be unto you a source of sickness, because ye have resisted the Lord, Who is among you, and have wept before Him, saying, Wherefore came we forth out of Egypt?

21 And Moses said, Six hundred thousand footmen are the people, among whom I am, [even] among them; and Thou hast said, I will give them flesh, and they shall eat for a month of days. 22 Shall ye not act, and *othes* be slaughtered for them, and shall it suffice them? Or shall all the height of the sea be gathered for them, and shall it suffice them?

23 And the Lord said unto Moses, Is the hand of the Lord not sufficient? Now shalt thou know whether My word shall be fulfilled concerning thee, or no.

24 And Moses went out, and spake unto the people the words of the Lord: and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the Tabernacle. 25 And the Lord came down in a cloud, and the Lord spake unto him, and took of the Spirit that was upon him, and laid it upon the seventy men, the elders. And when the Spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, and did so no more.

26 And there were left two men in the camp: the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the second was Medad. And the Spirit rested upon them, and these were of them that were written, and they went not out unto the Tabernacle; and they prophesied in the camp. 27 And a young man ran forth, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.

28 And Joshua the son of Nun, who stood by Moses, his chosen, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them. 29 And Moses said unto him, Art thou jealous for my sake? And who shall grant that all the Lord's people were prophets, when the Lord shall put His Spirit upon them?

30 And Moses went into the camp, he and the elders of Israel. 31 And there went forth a wind from the Lord, and it brought quails from the sea, and cast them upon the camp, a day's journey on this side and a day's journey on that side, round about the camp, as it were two cubits high upon the ground.

32 And the people rose up all that day, and all that night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails. He that gathered least, gathered ten homers. And they spread them out for themselves to dry, round about the camp. 33 The flesh was yet between their teeth, before it was consumed, and the Lord was wroth with anger against the people, and the Lord smote [them].
