16 ἐνύπνια, συγκρίναι αὐτά. Ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ Ἰωσὴφ τῷ Φαραώ, εἶπεν· ἄνευ τοῦ Θεοῦ οὐκ ἀποκριθήσεται τὸ σωτήριον Φαραώ.
17 Ἐλάλησε δὲ Φαραὼ τῷ Ἰωσήφ, λέγων· ἐν τῷ ὕπνῳ μου ὤμην ἑστάναι ἐπὶ τὸ χεῖλος τοῦ ποταμοῦ·
18 καὶ ὥσπερ ἐκ τοῦ ποταμοῦ ἀνέβαινον ἑπτὰ βόες καλαὶ τῷ εἴδει, καὶ ἐκλεκταὶ ταῖς σαρξί, καὶ ἐνέμοντο ἐν τῷ Ἄχει.
19 Καὶ ἰδοὺ ἑπτὰ βόες ἕτεραι ἀνέβαινον ὀπίσω αὐτῶν ἐκ τοῦ ποταμοῦ, πονηραὶ καὶ αἰσχραὶ τῷ εἴδει σφόδρα,
20 καὶ λεπταὶ ταῖς σαρξί, (καὶ ἐνέμοντο ἐν τῷ Ἄχει) οἵας οὐκ εἶδον τοιαύτας ἐν ὅλῃ τῇ Αἰγύπτῳ αἰσχροτέρας.
21 Καὶ κατέφαγον αἱ ἑπτὰ βόες αἱ αἰσχραὶ καὶ λεπταὶ τὰς ἑπτὰ βόας τὰς πρώτας τὰς καλὰς καὶ ἐκλεκτάς· καὶ εἰσῆλθον εἰς τὰς κοιλίας αὐτῶν, καὶ οὐ διάδηλοι ἐγένοντο, ὅτι εἰσῆλθον εἰς τὰς κοιλίας αὐτῶν, καὶ αἱ ὄψεις αὐτῶν αἰσχραί, καθὰ καὶ τὴν ἀρχήν. Ἐξεγερθεὶς δὲ ἐκοιμήθην.
22 Καὶ ἴδον πάλιν ἐν τῷ ὕπνῳ μου, καὶ ὥσπερ ἑπτὰ στάχυες ἀνέβαινον ἐν πυθμένι ἑνί, πλήρεις καὶ καλοί.
23 Ἄλλοι δὲ ἑπτὰ στάχυες λεπτοὶ καὶ ἀνεμόφθοροι ἀνερύοντο, ἐχόμενοι αὐτῶν.
24 Καὶ κατέπιον οἱ ἑπτὰ στάχυες οἱ λεπτοὶ καὶ ἀνεμόφθοροι τοὺς ἑπτὰ στάχυας τοὺς καλοὺς καὶ τοὺς πλήρεις. Εἶπα οὖν τοῖς ἐξηγηταῖς, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ ἀπαγγέλλων μοι.
25 Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰωσὴφ τῷ Φαραώ· τὸ ἐνύπνιον Φαραὼ ἕν ἐστιν· ὅσα ὁ Θεὸς ποιεῖ, ἔδειξε τῷ Φαραώ.
26 Αἱ ἑπτὰ βόες αἱ καλαί, ἑπτὰ ἔτη ἐστί· καὶ οἱ ἑπτὰ στάχυες οἱ καλοί, ἑπτὰ ἔτη ἐστί· τὸ ἐνύπνιον Φαραὼ ἕν ἐστι.
27 Καὶ αἱ ἑπτὰ βόες αἱ λεπταὶ αἱ ἀναβαίνουσαι ὀπίσω αὐτῶν, ἑπτὰ ἔτη ἐστί· καὶ οἱ ἑπτὰ στάχυες οἱ λεπτοὶ καὶ ἀνεμόφθοροι, ἔσονται ἑπτὰ ἔτη λιμοῦ.
28 Τὸ δὲ ῥῆμα ὃ εἴρηκα Φαραώ· ὅσα ὁ Θεὸς ποιεῖ, ἔδειξε τῷ Φαραώ.
29 Ἰδοὺ ἑπτὰ ἔτη ἔρχεται, εὐθηνία πολλὴ ἐν πάσῃ τῇ Αἰγύπτῳ.
30 Ἥξει δὲ ἑπτὰ ἔτη λιμοῦ μετὰ ταῦτα, καὶ ἐπιλησθήσονται τῆς πλησμονῆς ἐν ὅλῃ τῇ γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ, καὶ ἀναλώσει ὁ λιμὸς τὴν γῆν·
31 καὶ οὐκ ἐπιγνωσθήσεται ἡ εὐθηνία ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς ἀπὸ τοῦ λιμοῦ τοῦ ἐσομένου μετὰ ταῦτα, ἰσχυρὸς γὰρ ἔσται σφόδρα.
32 Περὶ δὲ τοῦ δευτερώσαι τὸ ἐνύπνιον Φαραὼ δίς, ὅτι ἀληθὲς ἔσται τὸ ῥῆμα τὸ παρὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ ταχυνεῖ ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ ποιῆσαι αὐτό.
33 Νῦν οὖν σκέψαι ἄνθρωπον φρόνιμον καὶ συνετόν, καὶ κατάστησον αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς Αἰγύπτου·
34 καὶ ποιησάτω Φαραὼ καὶ καταστησάτω τοπάρχας ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς· καὶ ἀποδεκατωσάτωσαν πάντα τὰ γεννήματα τῆς γῆς Αἰγύπτου τῶν ἑπτὰ

**GENESIS, CHAPTER 41**

Dreams, to interpret them. And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, "Without God shall no saving answer be given unto Pharaoh."
Then Pharaoh spoke unto Joseph, saying, "In my dream, I imagined I stood upon the bank of the river; and, behold, there came up from the river seven kine, beautiful in form and choice in flesh; and they grazed in the Nile. And behold, seven other kine came up after them from the river, evil and exceeding foul in form, and thin in flesh; (and they grazed in the Nile) such as I had not seen more loathsome in all the land of Egypt. And the seven foul and thin kine devoured the seven first kine, the beautiful and the choice; yet when they had entered into their bellies, it could not be discerned that they had entered into their bellies, and their countenances were foul, as at the first. Then, having awoken, I slept [again].

"And I saw again in my dream, and behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, full and good. And seven other ears, thin and blasted by the wind, sprang up, following after them. And the seven thin and wind-blasted ears swallowed up the seven good and full ears. Then I told [it] unto the interpreters, but there was none who could declare [it] unto me."

And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, "The dream of Pharaoh is one [and the same]: what God is about to do, He hath shown unto Pharaoh. The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years; the dream of Pharaoh is one [and the same]. And the seven thin kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven thin and wind-blasted ears shall be seven years of famine. This is the word which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: what God is about to do, He hath shown unto Pharaoh.

"Behold, there come seven years of great abundance throughout all the land of Egypt. And there shall come after them seven years of famine, and all the abundance shall be forgotten in all the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land. And the abundance shall not be discerned in the land by reason of that famine which shall follow after these things; for it shall be exceeding grievous. And concerning that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice, it is because the word from God shall be true, and God will hasten to perform it.

"Now therefore, let Pharaoh seek out a man of prudence and understanding, and set him over the land of Egypt. And let Pharaoh do [this], and let him appoint overseers over the land; and let them take a tenth of all the produce of the land of Egypt in the seven"
