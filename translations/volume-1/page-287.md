**ΚΕΦ. ΙΘ΄.**
22 ἕως ἑσπέρας. Καὶ παντὸς οὗ ἐὰν ἅψηται αὐτοῦ ὁ ἀκάθαρτος, ἀκάθαρτον ἔσται· καὶ ἡ ψυχὴ ἡ ἁπτομένη ἀκάθαρτος ἔσται ἕως ἑσπέρας.

**ΚΕΦ. Κ΄.**
1 Καὶ ἦλθον οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ, πᾶσα ἡ συναγωγή, εἰς τὴν ἔρημον Σὶν ἐν τῷ μηνὶ τῷ πρώτῳ· καὶ κατέμεινεν ὁ λαὸς ἐν Κάδης.
2 Καὶ ἐτελεύτησεν ἐκεῖ Μαριάμ, καὶ ἐτάφη. ἐκεῖ. Καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὕδωρ τῇ συναγωγῇ· καὶ συνθροίσθησαν ἐπὶ Μωυσῆν καὶ Ἀαρών.
3 Καὶ ἐλοιδορεῖτο ὁ λαὸς πρὸς Μωυσῆν, καὶ εἶπαν, λέγοντες· ὄφελον ἀπωλόμεθα ἐν τῇ ἀπωλείᾳ τῶν ἀδελφῶν ἡμῶν ἔναντι Κυρίου·
4 καὶ ἵνατί ἀνηγάγετε τὴν συναγωγὴν Κυρίου εἰς τὴν ἔρημον ταύτην, ἀποκτεῖναι ἐκεῖ ἡμᾶς καὶ τὰ κτήνη ἡμῶν;
5 καὶ ἵνατί τοῦτο; ἀνηγάγετε ἡμᾶς ἐξ Αἰγύπτου, παραγενέσθαι ἡμᾶς εἰς τὸν τόπον τὸν πονηρὸν τοῦτον, τόπος οὗ οὐ σπείρεται, οὐδὲ συκαῖ, οὐδὲ ἀμπελοι, οὔτε ῥοαί, οὔτε ὕδωρ ἐστὶ πιεῖν.
6 Καὶ ἦλθε Μωυσῆς καὶ Ἀαρὼν ἀπὸ προσώπου τῆς συναγωγῆς ἐπὶ τὴν θύραν τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου, καὶ ἔπεσαν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον αὐτῶν, καὶ ὤφθη ἡ δόξα Κυρίου πρὸς αὐτοῦς.
7 Καὶ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, λέγων·
8 Λάβε τὴν ῥάβδον, καὶ ἐκκλησίασον τὴν συναγωγὴν σὺ καὶ Ἀαρὼν ὁ ἀδελφός σου, καὶ λαλήσατε πρὸς τὴν πέτραν ἐναντίον αὐτῶν, καὶ δώσει τὰ ὕδατα αὐτῆς· καὶ ἐξοίσετε αὐτοῖς ὕδωρ ἐκ τῆς πέτρας, καὶ ποτιεῖτε τὴν συναγωγὴν καὶ τὰ κτήνη αὐτῶν.
9 Καὶ ἔλαβε Μωυσῆς τὴν ῥάβδον τὴν ἀπέναντι Κυρίου, καθὰ συνέταξε Κύριος.
10 Καὶ ἐξεκκλησίασε Μωυσῆς καὶ Ἀαρὼν τὴν συναγωγὴν ἀπέναντι τῆς πέτρας, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτούς· ἀκούσατέ μου οἱ ἀπειθεῖς· μὴ ἐκ τῆς πέτρας ταύτης ἐξάξωμεν ὑμῖν ὕδωρ;
11 Καὶ ἐπάρας Μωυσῆς τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ, ἐπάταξε τὴν πέτραν τῇ ῥάβδῳ αὐτοῦ δίς· καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ὕδωρ πολύ, καὶ ἔπιεν ἡ συναγωγὴ καὶ τὰ κτήνη αὐτῶν.
12 Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν καὶ Ἀαρών· ὅτι οὐκ ἐπιστεύσατε ἐν ἐμοί, ἁγιάσαι με ἐναντίον τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, διὰ τοῦτο οὐκ εἰσάξετε ὑμεῖς τὴν συναγωγὴν ταύτην εἰς τὴν γῆν, ἣν ἔδωκα αὐτοῖς.
13 Τοῦτο ὕδωρ ἀντιλογίας, ὅτι ἐλοιδορήθησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ ἔναντι Κυρίου, καὶ ἡγιάσθη ἐν αὐτοῖς.
14 Καὶ ἀπέστειλε Μωυσῆς ἀγγέλους ἐκ Κάδης πρὸς βασιλέα Ἐδώμ, λέγων· τάδε

22 ...until the evening. And whatsoever the unclean person shall touch, it shall be unclean; and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until the evening.

**Chapter 20**
1 And the sons of Israel came, even the whole congregation, into the wilderness of Zin in the first month; and the people abode in Kadesh.
2 And there Miriam died, and she was buried. There. And there was no water for the congregation; and they gathered themselves together against Moses and Aaron.
3 And the people chided with Moses, and spake, saying, "Would that we had perished in the destruction of our brethren before the Lord!
4 And wherefore have ye brought up the congregation of the Lord into this wilderness, to kill us there, and our cattle?
5 And wherefore [is] this? [That] ye have brought us up out of Egypt, that we should come unto this evil place, a place where no seed is sown, nor figs, nor vines, nor pomegranates, neither is there water to drink."
6 And Moses and Aaron came from the presence of the congregation unto the door of the tabernacle of testimony, and they fell upon their faces; and the glory of the Lord appeared unto them.
7 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
8 "Take the rod, and gather the congregation together, thou and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth its waters. And ye shall bring forth water unto them out of the rock; and ye shall give drink to the congregation and their cattle."
9 And Moses took the rod that was before the Lord, as the Lord commanded [him].
10 And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said unto them, "Hear now, ye rebels; shall *we* bring forth water unto you out of this rock?"
11 And Moses lifted up his hand, and smote the rock with his rod twice; and much water came forth, and the congregation drank, and their cattle.
12 And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron, [saying], "Because ye believed not in Me, to sanctify Me in the sight of the sons of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land, which I have given to them."
13 This is the water of contention, because the sons of Israel chided before the Lord; and He was sanctified in their midst.
14 And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, saying, "Thus:"
