180 ΛΕΥΙΤΙΚΟΝ ΚΕΦ. ςʹ.
5           ἥρπασεν, ἢ τὸ ἀδίκημα, ὃ ἠδίκησεν, ἢ τὴν παραθήκην, ἥτις πα-
            ρετέθη αὐτῷ, ἢ τὴν ἀπώλειαν, ἣν εὗρεν, ἀπὸ παντὸς πράγματος,
6           οὗ ὤμοσε περὶ αὐτοῦ ἀδίκως , καὶ ἀποτίσει αὐτὸ τὸ κεφάλαιον
            αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὸ ἐπίπεμπτον αὐτοῦ προσθήσει ἐπ᾽ αὐτό· τίνος ἐστίν,
            αὐτῷ ἀποδώσει αὐτό, ᾗ ἡμέρᾳ ἐλεγχθῇ· καὶ τῆς πλημμελείας αὐ-
            τοῦ οἴσει Κυρίῳ κριὸν ἀπὸ τῶν προβάτων ἄμωμον, τιμῆς εἰς ὃ
7           ἐπλημμέλησε, πρὸς τὸν ἱερέα· καὶ ἐξιλάσεται περὶ αὐτοῦ ὁ ἱερεὺς
            ἔναντι Κυρίου, καὶ ἀφεθήσεται αὐτῷ περὶ ἑνὸς ἀπὸ πάντων ὧν
            ἐποίησε, καὶ ἐπλημμέλησεν ἐν αὐτῷ.
8           Καὶ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωϋσῆν , λέγων·
9           ἔντειλαι ᾿Ααρὼν καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ , λέγων·
            οὗτος ὁ νόμος τῆς ὁλοκαυτώσεως· αὕτη ἡ ὁλοκαύτωσις ἐπὶ τῆς
            καύσεως αὐτῆς ἐπὶ τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου ὅλην τὴν νύκτα ἕως τὸ πρωΐ,
            καὶ τὸ πῦρ τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου καυθήσεται ἐπ᾽ αὐτοῦ, οὐ σβεσθήσεται.
10          Καὶ ἐνδύσεται ὁ ἱερεὺς χιτῶνα λινοῦν, καὶ περισκελὲς λινοῦν ἐν-
            δύσεται τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀφελεῖ τὴν κατακάρπωσιν , ἣν ἂν
            καταναλώσει τὸ πῦρ, τὴν ὁλοκαύτωσιν ἀπὸ τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου, καὶ
11          παραθήσει αὐτὸ ἐχόμενον τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου· καὶ ἐκδύσεται τὴν στο-
            λὴν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐνδύσεται στολὴν ἄλλην, καὶ ἐξοίσει τὴν κατακάρ-
            πωσιν ἔξω τῆς παρεμβολῆς εἰς τόπον καθαρόν·
12          καὶ πῦρ ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον καυθήσεται ἐπ᾽ αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐ σβεσθήσεται·
            καὶ καύσει ὁ ἱερεὺς ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸ ξύλα τὸ πρωΐ πρωΐ, καὶ στοιβάσει ἐπ᾽ αὐ-
            τοῦ τὴν ὁλοκαύτωσιν, καὶ ἐπιθήσει ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸ τὸ στέαρ τοῦ σωτη-
13          ρίου· καὶ πῦρ διαπαντὸς καυθήσεται ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστηρίον, οὐ σβε-
14          σθήσεται. Οὗτος ὁ νόμος τῆς θυσίας , ἣν προσάξουσιν αὐτὴν οἱ
            υἱοὶ ᾿Ααρὼν ἔναντι Κυρίου, ἀπέναντι τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου·
15          καὶ ἀφελεῖ ἀπ᾽ αὐτοῦ τῇ δρακὶ αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τῆς σεμιδάλεως τῆς
            θυσίας σὺν τῷ ἐλαίῳ αὐτῆς, καὶ σὺν παντὶ τῷ λιβάνῳ αὐτῆς, τὰ
            ὄντα ἐπὶ τῆς θυσίας· καὶ ἀνοίσει ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον κάρπωμα
            ὀσμὴν εὐωδίας, τὸ μνημόσυνον αὐτῆς τῷ Κυρίῳ.
16          Τὸ δὲ καταλειφθὲν ἀπ᾽ αὐτῆς ἔδεται ᾿Ααρὼν καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ
            ἄζυμα βρωθήσεται ἐν τόπῳ ἁγίῳ, ἐν αὐλῇ τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου
            ἔδονται αὐτῇ.
17          Οὐ περθήσεται ἐζυμωμένη· μερίδα αὐτὴν ἔδωκα αὐτοῖς ἀπὸ τῶν καρ-
            πωμάτων Κυρίου· ἅγια ἁγίων ἐστίν, ὥσπερ τὸ τῆς ἁμαρτίας, καὶ
            ὥσπερ τὸ τῆς πλημμελείας.
18          Πᾶν ἀρσενικὸν τῶν ἱερέων ἔδονται αὐτήν· νόμιμον αἰώνιον εἰς τὰς
            γενεὰς ὑμῶν ἀπὸ τῶν καρπωμάτων Κυρίου·
19          πᾶς ὃς ἂν ἅψηται αὐτῶν ἁγιασθήσεται. Καὶ ἐλάλησε

### Literary Translation

### Leviticus Chapter 6

**5** [or] that which he hath violently taken away, or the wrong that he hath committed, or the deposit which was committed unto him, or the lost thing which he hath found, from all manner of things;
**6** concerning which he hath sworn falsely, then shall he restore the principal thereof, and the fifth part thereof shall he add thereto; unto him whose it is, shall he restore it on the day he is convicted. And for his trespass, he shall bring unto the Lord a ram without blemish from the flock, of [the] value for that wherein he hath trespassed, unto the priest.
**7** And the priest shall make atonement for him before the Lord, and it shall be forgiven him concerning any one of all the things which he hath done, and wherein he hath trespassed.

**8** And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying:
**9** Command Aaron and his sons, saying: This is the law of the burnt offering: the burnt offering itself shall be upon the burning on the altar all the night until the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be burning upon it; it shall not be quenched.
**10** And the priest shall put on a linen tunic, and he shall put on linen breeches upon his body, and he shall take away the ashes, which the fire hath consumed, [even] the burnt offering from the altar; and
**11** he shall lay them beside the altar. Then shall he put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes outside the camp into a clean place.
**12** And the fire upon the altar shall burn thereon; it shall not be quenched. And the priest shall burn wood upon it morning by morning, and lay the burnt offering in order upon it; and he shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offering.
**13** And the fire shall ever burn upon the altar; it shall not be quenched.

**14** This is the law of the offering, which the sons of Aaron shall bring it before the Lord, before the altar.
**15** And he shall take from it with his hand, of the fine flour of the offering with the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is upon the offering; and he shall offer [it] upon the altar as a portion, an odor of sweetness, the memorial thereof, unto the Lord.
**16** And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat; unleavened shall it be eaten in a holy place, in the court of the tabernacle of testimony shall they eat it.
**17** It shall not be plundered, being leavened. I have given it unto them as their portion from the offerings of the Lord; it is most holy, even as the sin offering, and as the trespass offering.
**18** Every male among the priests shall eat thereof. [It is] a perpetual statute throughout your generations from the offerings of the Lord.
**19** Whosoever toucheth them shall be holy. And the Lord spake…
