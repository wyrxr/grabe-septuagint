καὶ προβιβάσεις αὐτὰ τοὺς υἱούς σου, καὶ λαλήσεις ἐν αὐτοῖς 7
καθήμενος ἐν οἴκῳ, καὶ πορευόμενος ἐν ὁδῷ, καὶ κοιταζόμενος,
καὶ ἀνιστάμενος· καὶ ἀφάψεις αὐτὰ εἰς σημεῖον ἐπὶ τῆς χειρός 8
σου, καὶ ἔσται ἀσάλευτον πρὸ ὀφθαλμῶν σου· καὶ γράψεις αὐτὰ 9
ἐπὶ τὰς φλιὰς τῶν οἰκιῶν ὑμῶν, καὶ τῶν πυλῶν ὑμῶν. Καὶ ἔσται 10
ὅταν εἰσαγάγῃ σε Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου εἰς τὴν γῆν ἣν ὤμοσε τοῖς
πατράσι σου, τῷ Ἀβραάμ, καὶ Ἰσαάκ, καὶ Ἰακώβ, δοῦναί σοι
πόλεις μεγάλας καὶ καλὰς, ἃς οὐκ ᾠκοδόμησας, οἰκίας πλήρεις 11
πάντων ἀγαθῶν, ἃς οὐκ ἐνέπλησας, λάκκους λελατομημένους οὓς
οὐκ ἐξελατόμησας, ἀμπελῶνας καὶ ἐλαιῶνας οὓς οὐ κατεφύτευ-
σας, καὶ φάγων καὶ ἐμπλησθεὶς, πρόσεχε σεαυτῷ μὴ πλατυν- 12
θῇ ἡ καρδία σου, καὶ ἐπιλάθῃ Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ σου, τοῦ ἐξα-
γαγόντος σε ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, ἐξ οἴκου δουλείας. Κύριον τὸν 13
Θεόν σου προσκυνήσεις, καὶ αὐτῷ μόνῳ λατρεύσεις, καὶ πρὸς αὐ-
τὸν κολληθήσῃ, καὶ ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι αὐτοῦ ὀμῇ. Οὐ μὴ πορεύσε- 14
σθε ὀπίσω θεῶν ἑτέρων ἀπὸ τῶν θεῶν τῶν ἐθνῶν τῶν περικύκλω
ὑμῶν· ὅτι Θεὸς ζηλωτὴς Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου ἐν σοί· μή ποτε ὀρ- 15

ἀπὸ προσώπου τῆς γῆς. Οὐκ ἐκπειράσεις Κύριον τὸν Θεόν σου, 16
ἐν τρόπον ἐξειπεράσασθε ἐν τῷ πειρασμῷ. Φυλάσσων φυλάξῃ τὰς 17
ἐντολὰς Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ σου, καὶ τὰ μαρτύρια αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰ
δικαιώματα αὐτοῦ, ὅσα ἐνετείλατό σοι· καὶ ποιήσεις τὸ καλὸν καὶ 18
τὸ ἀρεστὸν ἐναντίον Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ σου, ἵνα εὖ σοι γένηται,

**DEUTERONOMY CHAPTER 6**

7 And thou shalt impress them upon thy sons,
and shalt speak of them
when thou sittest in thine house,
and when thou walkest by the way,
and when thou liest down,
and when thou risest up;
8 And thou shalt bind them as a sign upon thine hand,
and they shall be immovable before thine eyes;
9 And thou shalt write them upon the doorposts of your houses,
and upon your gates.

10 And it shall be,
when the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land
which He sware unto thy fathers,
unto Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob,
to give thee great and goodly cities,
which thou didst not build;
11 And houses full of all good things,
which thou didst not fill,
and cisterns hewn out,
which thou didst not hew,
vineyards and olive groves,
which thou didst not plant;
and when thou hast eaten and art full,
12 take heed to thyself,
lest thy heart be enlarged,
and thou forget the LORD thy God,
Who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt,
from the house of bondage.

13 The LORD thy God shalt thou worship,
and Him only shalt thou serve,
and unto Him shalt thou cleave,
and by His Name shalt thou swear.
14 Ye shall not go after other gods,
of the gods of the nations
that are round about you;
15 For a jealous God is the LORD thy God among you;
lest by any means the LORD thy God be wroth in anger among you,
and destroy thee from off the face of the earth.
16 Thou shalt not tempt the LORD thy God,
in like manner as ye tempted [Him] in the trial [at Massah].

17 Thou shalt diligently keep the commandments
of the LORD thy God,
and His testimonies, and His judgments,
whatsoever He hath commanded thee;
18 And thou shalt do that which is good and right
in the sight of the LORD thy God,
that it may be well with thee,
and that thou mayest enter in
and inherit the good land,
which the LORD sware
19 to give unto your fathers,
to drive out all thine enemies from before thy face,
as the LORD hath spoken.

20 And it shall be,
when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying,
"What are these testimonies,
and these judgments,
and these anointings,
which the LORD our God hath commanded you?"
21 Then thou shalt say unto thy son,
"We were bondmen unto Pharaoh in the land of Egypt;
and the LORD brought us forth thence
with a mighty hand, and with a high arm;
22 And the LORD wrought great and grievous signs and wonders in Egypt,
upon Pharaoh and upon all his house,
before our eyes;
23 And the LORD our God brought us out from thence,
that He might bring us in,
to give us this land,
which the LORD our God sware unto our fathers,
to give us.
24 And the LORD commanded us to do all the commandments..."
