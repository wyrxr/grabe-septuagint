Αἰγύπτου. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν· ἑώρακα τὸν λαὸν 9
τοῦτον, καὶ ἰδοὺ λαὸς σκληροτράχηλός ἐστι. Καὶ νῦν ἔασόν με, 10
καὶ θυμωθεὶς ὀργῇ εἰς αὐτούς, ἐκτρίψω αὐτούς, καὶ ποιήσω σε
εἰς ἔθνος μέγα. Καὶ ἐδεήθη Μωυσῆς κατέναντι Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ 11
αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπεν· ἵνα τί Κύριε θυμοῖς ὀργῇ εἰς τὸν λαόν σου, οὓς
ἐξήγαγες ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου ἐν ἰσχύϊ μεγάλῃ, καὶ ἐν βρα-
χίονι ὑψηλῷ; Μή ποτε εἴπωσιν οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι, λέγοντες· μετά πο- 12
νηρίας ἐξήγαγεν αὐτούς, ἀποκτεῖναι αὐτοὺς ἐν τοῖς ὄρεσι, καὶ ἐξ-
αναλῶσαι αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς. Παῦσαι τῆς ὀργῆς τοῦ θυμοῦ σου,
καὶ ἵλεως γενοῦ ἐπὶ τῇ κακίᾳ τοῦ λαοῦ σου, μνησθεὶς Ἀβραὰμ 13
καὶ Ἰσαὰκ καὶ Ἰακὼβ τῶν σῶν οἰκετῶν, οἷς ὤμοσας αὐτοῖς κα-
τὰ σαυτοῦ, καὶ ἐλάλησας πρὸς αὐτούς, λέγων· πολυπληθυνῶ τὸ
σπέρμα ὑμῶν ὡσεὶ τὰ ἄστρα τοῦ οὐρανοῦ τῷ πλήθει, καὶ πᾶσαν
τὴν γῆν ταύτην ἣν εἶπας δοῦναι τῷ σπέρματι αὐτῶν, καὶ καθέ-
ξουσιν αὐτὴν εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα. Καὶ ἱλάσθη Κύριος περὶ τῆς κακίας, 14
ἧς εἶπε ποιῆσαι πρὸς τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἀποστρέψας Μωυσῆς, 15
κατέβη ἀπὸ τοῦ ὄρους· καὶ αἱ δύο πλάκες τοῦ μαρτυρίου ἐν ταῖς
χερσὶν αὐτοῦ, πλάκες λίθιναι, γεγραμμέναι ἐξ ἀμφοτέρων τῶν με-
ρῶν αὐτῶν, ἔνθεν καὶ ἔνθεν ἦσαν γεγραμμέναι· καὶ αἱ πλάκες 16
ἔργον Θεοῦ ἦσαν, καὶ ἡ γραφὴ γραφὴ Θεοῦ ἐστι, κεκολαμμένη ἐν
ταῖς πλαξί. Καὶ ἀκούσας Ἰησοῦς τὴν φωνὴν τοῦ λαοῦ κραζόντων, 17
λέγει πρὸς Μωυσῆν· φωνὴ πολέμου ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ. Καὶ λέγει· 18
οὐκ ἔστι φωνὴ ἐξαρχόντων κατ᾽ ἰσχύν, οὐδὲ φωνὴ ἐξαρχόντων τρο-
πῆς, ἀλλὰ φωνὴν ἐξαρχόντων οἴνου ἐγὼ ἀκούω. Ἡνίκα δὲ ἤγ- 19
γισε τῇ παρεμβολῇ, εἶδεν τὸν μόσχον καὶ τοὺς χορούς, καὶ ὀργι-
σθεὶς θυμῷ Μωυσῆς, ἐξέριψεν ἀπὸ τῶν χειρῶν αὐτοῦ τὰς δύο πλά-
κας, καὶ συνέτριψεν αὐτὰς ὑπὸ τὸ ὄρος· καὶ λαβὼν τὸν μόσχον 20
ὃν ἐποίησαν, κατέκαυσεν ἐν πυρί, καὶ κατήλεσε λεπτόν, καὶ ἔσπει-
ρεν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὸ ὕδωρ, καὶ ἐπότισεν αὐτὸ τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ 21
εἶπε Μωυσῆς πρὸς Ἀαρών· τί ἐποίησέ σοι ὁ λαὸς οὗτος, ὅτι ἐ-
πήγαγες ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς ἁμαρτίαν μεγάλην; Καὶ εἶπεν Ἀαρὼν πρὸς 22
Μωυσῆν, λέγων· μὴ ὀργίζου κύριε· σὺ γὰρ οἶδας τὸ ὅρμημα τοῦ
λαοῦ τούτου. Λέγουσι γάρ μοι· ποίησον ἡμῖν θεούς, οἳ προπορεύ- 23
σονται ἡμῶν· ὁ γὰρ Μωυσῆς οὗτος ὁ ἄνθρωπος, ὃς ἐξήγαγεν ἡ-
μᾶς ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, οὐκ οἴδαμεν τί γέγονεν αὐτῷ. Καὶ εἶπα 24
αὐτοῖς· τίνι ὑπάρχει χρυσία, περιέλεσθε. Καὶ ἔδωκαν μοι· καὶ ἐξ-

### EXODUS 32

**9** of Egypt. And the Lord said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked people.
**10** And now, let Me alone, and My wrath shall be kindled against them, and I will utterly destroy them; and I will make of thee a great nation.
**11** And Moses made supplication before the Lord his God, and said, Wherefore, O Lord, art Thou wroth with wrath against Thy people, which Thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great might, and with a high arm?
**12** Lest peradventure the Egyptians speak, saying, With evil intent did He bring them forth to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from off the face of the earth. Cease from the wrath of Thy fury, and be propitious concerning the evil of Thy people,
**13** remembering Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, Thy servants, to whom Thou didst swear by Thyself, and didst speak unto them, saying, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven in number, and all this land which Thou didst say to give unto their seed, they shall possess it forever.
**14** And the Lord was propitious concerning the evil which He had said He would do unto His people.
**15** And Moses turned and went down from the mountain; and the two tablets of the testimony were in his hands, tablets of stone, written on both their sides, on the one side and on the other were they written.
**16** And the tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved upon the tablets.
**17** And when Joshua heard the voice of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, There is a voice of war in the camp.
**18** And he said, It is not the voice of those who triumph by might, nor the voice of those who lead to flight, but the voice of those who lead a revelry of wine do I hear.
**19** And as soon as he drew nigh unto the camp, he saw the calf, and the dancing; and Moses was wroth with wrath, and cast the two tablets from his hands, and broke them beneath the mountain.
**20** And he took the calf which they had made, and burned it with fire, and ground it very small, and scattered it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink thereof.
**21** And Moses said unto Aaron, What hath this people done unto thee, that thou hast brought upon them so great a sin?
**22** And Aaron said unto Moses, Let not my lord be angry; for thou knowest the impetuousness of this people.
**23** For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.
**24** And I said unto them, Whosoever hath gold, let him take it off. And they gave it to me; and [I cast it] forth—
