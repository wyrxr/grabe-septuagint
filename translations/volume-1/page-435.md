ρεις. Ὑμεῖς δὲ ἑωράκατε πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς
ὑμῶν πᾶσι τοῖς ἔθνεσι τούτοις ἀπὸ προσώπου ὑμῶν, ὅτι Κύριος
4 ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν αὐτὸς ὁ ἐκπολεμήσας ὑμῖν· ἴδετε ὅτι ἐπέῤῥιψα ὑμῖν
τὰ ἔθνη τὰ καταλελειμμένα ὑμῖν ταῦτα ἐν τοῖς κλήροις εἰς τὰς
φυλὰς ὑμῶν, ἀπὸ τοῦ Ἰορδάνου, καὶ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη ἃ ἐξωλέθρευ-
σα, καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς θαλάσσης τῆς μεγάλης, ἐρεῖ ἐπὶ δυσμὰς ἡλίου.
5 Κύριος δὲ ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν αὐτὸς ἐξολοθρεύσει αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ προσώπου
ὑμῶν, ἕως ἂν ἀπόλωνται· καὶ ἀποστελεῖ αὐτοῖς τὰ θηρία τὰ
ἄγρια, ἕως ἂν ἐξολοθρεύσῃ αὐτοὺς καὶ τοὺς βασιλεῖς αὐτῶν ἀπὸ
προσώπου ὑμῶν καὶ ἐξολοθρεύσει αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ προσώπου σου, καὶ
κατακληρονομήσετε τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν, καθὰ ἐλάλησε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς
6 ὑμῶν ὑμῖν. Κατισχύσατε οὖν σφόδρα φυλάσσειν καὶ ποιεῖν πάντα
τὰ γεγραμμένα ἐν τῷ βιβλίῳ τοῦ νόμου Μωυσῆ, ἵνα μὴ ἐκκλίνητε
7 ἀπ᾽ αὐτοῦ εἰς δεξιὰ ἢ εἰς εὐώνυμα· ὅπως μὴ εἰσέλθητε εἰς τὰ
ἔθνη τὰ καταλελειμμένα ταῦτα μεθ᾽ ὑμῶν, καὶ τὰ ὀνόματα τῶν θεῶν
αὐτῶν οὐκ ὀνομασθήσεται ἐν ὑμῖν, καὶ οὐκ ὀμόσητε, οὔτε μὴ λα-
8 τρεύσητε αὐτοῖς, οὔτε μὴ προσκυνήσητε αὐτοῖς· ἀλλ᾽ ἢ Κυρίῳ τῷ
Θεῷ ὑμῶν προσκολληθήσεσθε, καθάπερ ἐποιήσατε ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας
9 ταύτης. Καὶ ἐξωλόθρευσε Κύριος αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ προσώπου ὑμῶν, ἔθνη
μεγάλα καὶ ἰσχυρά, καὶ ὑμῖν οὐδεὶς ἀντέστη κατενώπιον ὑμῶν
10 ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης· ἀνὴρ εἷς ὑμῶν ἐδίωξε χιλίους, ὅτι Κύριος
11 ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν οὗτος ἐξεπολέμει ὑμῖν, καθάπερ εἶπεν ὑμῖν. Καὶ
φυλάξασθε σφόδρα ταῖς ψυχαῖς ὑμῶν, τοῦ ἀγαπᾶν Κύριον τὸν Θεὸν
12 ὑμῶν. Ἐὰν γὰρ ἀποστροφῇ ἀποστραφῆτε, καὶ προστεθῆτε τοῖς
ὑπολειφθεῖσιν ἔθνεσι τούτοις τοῖς μεθ᾽ ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐπιγαμίας ποιήσητε
13 πρὸς αὐτοὺς, καὶ συγκαταμιγῆτε αὐτοῖς, καὶ αὐτοὶ ὑμῖν, γνώσει
γνώσεσθε ὅτι οὐ μὴ προσθῇ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν τοῦ ἐξολοθρεύ-
σαι τὰ ἔθνη ταῦτα ἀπὸ προσώπου ὑμῶν· καὶ ἔσονται ὑμῖν εἰς
παγίδας καὶ εἰς σκάνδαλα καὶ εἰς ἥλους ἐν ταῖς πτέρναις ὑμῶν,
καὶ εἰς βολίδας ἐν τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς ὑμῶν, ἕως ἂν ἀπόλησθε ἀπὸ
τῆς γῆς τῆς ἀγαθῆς ταύτης, ἧς ἔδωκεν ὑμῖν Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν.
14 Ἐγὼ δὲ ἀποτρέχω σήμερον τὴν ὁδὸν, καθὰ καὶ πάντες οἱ ἐπὶ
τῆς γῆς· καὶ γνώσεσθε ἐν ὅλῃ τῇ καρδίᾳ ὑμῶν καὶ ἐν ὅλῃ τῇ
ψυχῇ ὑμῶν, διότι οὐκ ἔπεσε λόγος εἷς ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν λόγων
τῶν καλῶν, ὧν εἶπε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν πρὸς ὑμᾶς· πάντα ἥκει
15 ὑμῖν, ἓν ῥῆμα οὐ διαπερώνηκεν ἐξ αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἔσται ἐν τρόπον

**Joshua 23**
<sup>3</sup> But ye yourselves have seen all that the LORD your God hath wrought unto all these nations before your face; for the LORD
<sup>4</sup> your God, He it is that hath fought for you. Behold, that I have apportioned unto you these nations which remain for you in your lots, for your tribes, from the Jordan, and all the nations which I have destroyed, even from the Great Sea, whereof it shall be declared to extend unto the setting of the sun.
<sup>5</sup> But the LORD your God, He Himself shall utterly destroy them from before your face, until they perish; and He shall send unto them the wild beasts, until He utterly destroy them and their kings from before your face; yea, He shall utterly destroy them from before thy face, and ye shall inherit their land, even as the LORD your God hath spoken unto you.
<sup>6</sup> Be ye therefore exceeding strong to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the Law of Moses, that ye turn not aside from it to the right hand or to the left;
<sup>7</sup> that ye may not come in unto these nations which are left among you; and the names of their gods shall not be named among you, nor shall ye swear [by them], neither shall ye serve them, nor shall ye worship them.
<sup>8</sup> But ye shall cleave unto the LORD your God, even as ye have done until this day.
<sup>9</sup> For the LORD hath utterly destroyed them from before your face, [even] great and mighty nations; and no man hath been able to stand before you until this day.
<sup>10</sup> One man of you hath chased a thousand, because the LORD your God, He it is, hath fought for you, even as He spake unto you.
<sup>11</sup> Take ye therefore exceeding great heed unto your souls, to love the LORD your God.
<sup>12</sup> For if ye turn away with turning, and cleave yourselves unto these nations which are left among you, and make marriages with them, and mingle yourselves with them, and they with you, then ye shall surely know that the LORD your God will no longer continue to utterly destroy these nations from before your face;
<sup>13</sup> and they shall be unto you for snares, and for stumbling-blocks, and for nails in your heels, and for darts in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land, which the LORD your God hath given unto you.
<sup>14</sup> But I go this day the way, even as all they that are upon the earth; and ye shall know in all your heart and in all your soul, that not one word hath failed of all the good words which the LORD your God spake unto you; all things are come unto you; not one word hath passed away from them.
<sup>15</sup> And it shall come to pass, in like manner,
