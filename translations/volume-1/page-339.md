ΔΕΥΤΕΡΟΝΟΜΙΟΝ ΚΕΦ. Ζ'. Η'.
τῶν ἐκ τοῦ τόπου ἐκείνου· οὐκ ἀντιστήσεταί σου, ἕως ἂν ἐξολοθρεύσῃς αὐτούς.
25 Τὰ γλυπτὰ τῶν θεῶν αὐτῶν κατακαύσετε πυρί, καὶ οὐκ ἐπιθυμήσεις ἀργύριον οὐδὲ χρυσίον ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν, λαβεῖν σεαυτῷ, μή ποτε πταίσῃς δι᾿ αὐτὸ, ὅτι βδέλυγμα Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ σου ἐστί·
26 καὶ οὐκ εἰσοίσεις βδέλυγμα εἰς τὸν οἶκόν σου, καὶ ἀνάθεμα ἔσῃ ὥσπερ τοῦτο· προσσοχθίσματι προσοχθιεῖς αὐτὸ, καὶ βδελύγματι βδελύξῃ αὐτὸ, ὅτι ἀνάθεμά ἐστι.

ΚΕΦ. Η'. VII.

1 Πᾶσας τὰς ἐντολὰς, ἃς ἐγὼ ἐντέλλομαι ὑμῖν σήμερον, φυλάξεσθε ποιεῖν, ἵνα ζῆτε καὶ πολυπλασιασθῆτε, καὶ εἰσέλθητε καὶ κληρονομήσητε τὴν γῆν (τὴν ἀγαθὴν), ἣν ὤμοσε Κύριος τοῖς πατράσιν ὑμῶν.
2 Καὶ μνησθήσῃ πᾶσαν τὴν ὁδὸν, ἣν ἤγαγέ σε Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου τοῦτο τεσσαράκοντα ἔτος ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, ὅπως κακώσῃ σε καὶ πειράσῃ σε, καὶ διαγνωσθῇ τὰ ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ σου, εἰ φυλάξῃ τας ἐντολὰς αὐτοῦ, ἢ οὔ.
3 Καὶ ἐκάκωσέ σε, καὶ ἐλιμάχνησέ σε, καὶ ἐψώμισέ σε τὸ μάννα, ὃ οὐκ ᾔδεις, καὶ οὐκ ᾔδεισαν οἱ πατέρες σου· ἵνα ἀναγγείλῃ σοι, ὅτι οὐκ ἐπ᾿ ἄρτῳ μόνῳ ζήσεται ὁ ἄνθρωπος, ἀλλ᾿ ἐπὶ παντὶ ῥήματι ἐκπορευομένῳ διὰ στόματος Θεοῦ ζήσεται ὁ ἄνθρωπος.
4 Τὰ ἱμάτιά σου οὐ κατετρίβη ἀπὸ σοῦ· οἱ πόδες σου οὐκ ἐτυλώθησαν, ἰδοὺ τεσσαράκοντα ἔτη.
5 Καὶ γνώσῃ τῇ καρδίᾳ σου, ὅτι ὡσεί τις ἄνθρωπος παιδεύσῃ τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ, οὕτως Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου παιδεύσει σε·
6 καὶ φυλάξῃ τὰς ἐντολὰς Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ σου, πορεύεσθαι ἐν ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὐτοῦ, καὶ φοβεῖσθαι αὐτόν.
7 Ὁ γὰρ Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου εἰσάξει σε εἰς τὴν γῆν τὴν ἀγαθὴν καὶ πολλὴν, οὗ χείμαῤῥοι ὑδάτων καὶ πηγαὶ ἀβύσσων ἐκπορευόμεναι διὰ τῶν ὀρέων καὶ διὰ τῶν πεδίων·
8 γῆ πυροῦ καὶ κριθῆς, ἄμπελοι, συκαῖ, ῥοαὶ, γῆ ἐλαίας ἐλαίου καὶ μέλιτος·
9 γῆ ἐφ᾿ ἧς οὐ μετὰ πτωχείας φάγῃ εἰς αὐτὴν τὸν ἄρτον σου, καὶ οὐκ ἐνδεηθήσῃ οὐδὲν ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς· γῆ ἧς οἱ λίθοι αὐτῆς σίδηρος,
10 καὶ ἐκ τῶν ὀρέων αὐτῆς μεταλλεύσεις χαλκόν· καὶ φαγῇ, καὶ ἐμπλησθήσῃ, καὶ εὐλογήσεις Κύριον τὸν Θεόν σου ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς τῆς ἀγαθῆς, ἧς ἔδωκέ σοι.
11 Πρόσεχε σεαυτῷ, μή ποτε ἐπιλάθῃ Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ σου, τοῦ μὴ φυλάξαι αὐτοῦ τὰς ἐντολὰς, καὶ τὰ κρίματα αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰ δικαιώματα αὐτοῦ, ὅσα ἐγὼ

**DEUTERONOMY CHAPTERS 7 & 8**

from those of that place, [so that] none shall stand against you, until you have utterly destroyed them.
25 The graven images of their gods you shall burn with fire; and you shall not covet the silver nor the gold that is upon them, to take it for yourself, lest you be ensnared by it, for it is an abomination to the Lord your God.
26 And you shall not bring an abomination into your house, for you shall be accursed, as is this [thing]. With utter loathing shall you utterly detest it, and with profound abhorrence shall you utterly abominate it, because it is an accursed thing.

**CHAPTER 8**

1 All the commandments which I give you today, you shall be careful to keep, so that you may live and be multiplied, and may enter in and possess the good land, which the Lord swore to your fathers.
2 And you shall remember all the way which the Lord your God has led you these forty years in the wilderness, that He might humble you and test you, to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep His commandments or not.
3 And He humbled you and allowed you to hunger, and He fed you with the manna, which you knew not, nor did your fathers know, that He might make it known to you that man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God shall man live.
4 Your raiment did not wear out upon you, nor did your feet swell, lo, these forty years.
5 And you shall know in your heart that, just as a man disciplines his son, so the Lord your God disciplines you.
6 Therefore you shall keep the commandments of the Lord your God, walking in His ways and fearing Him.
7 For the Lord your God is bringing you into a good and spacious land, a land where there are torrents of water, and springs from the depths, flowing forth through the mountains and through the plains;
8 a land of wheat and barley, of vines and fig trees and pomegranates; a land of olives yielding oil, and of honey;
9 a land wherein you shall eat your bread not in poverty, nor shall you lack any thing upon it; a land whose stones are iron,
10 and out of its mountains you shall mine bronze. And you shall eat and be satisfied, and you shall bless the Lord your God for the good land which He has given you.
11 Be careful lest you forget the Lord your God by not keeping His commandments, and His judgments, and His statutes, which I
