ΑΡΙΘΜΟΙ ΚΕΦ. Η´. Θ´.
τῇ σκηνῇ τοῦ μαρτυρίου ἐναντί **Ἀαρὼν**, καὶ ἐναντί τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ· καθὰ συνέταξε Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ περὶ τῶν Λευιτῶν, οὕτως
23 ἐποίησαν αὐτοῖς. Καὶ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, λέγων·
24 τοῦτ᾿ ἔστι τὸ περὶ τῶν Λευιτῶν· ἀπὸ πέντε καὶ εἰκοσαετοῦς καὶ
    ἐπάνω, εἰσελεύσονται λειτουργεῖν λειτουργίαν ἐν ἔργοις ἐν τῇ
25 σκηνῇ τοῦ μαρτυρίου· καὶ ἀπὸ πεντηκονταετοῦς ἀποστήσεται ἀπὸ
    τῆς λειτουργίας, καὶ οὐχὶ ἐργάται ἔτι· καὶ λειτουργήσει ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ σκηνῇ τοῦ μαρτυρίου φυλάσσειν φυλακὰς, ἔργα
    δὲ οὐκ ἐργάται. Οὕτω ποιήσεις τοῖς Λευίταις ἐν ταῖς φυλακαῖς
    αὐτῶν.

ΚΕΦ. Θ´. IX.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ Σινᾶ, ἐν τῷ
    ἔτει τῷ δευτέρῳ ἐξελθόντων αὐτῶν ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, ἐν τῷ μηνὶ
2 τῷ πρώτῳ, λέγων· εἶπον, καὶ ποιήτωσαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ τὸ πάσχα καθ᾿ ὥραν αὐτοῦ· τῇ τεσσαρεσκαιδεκάτῃ ἡμέρᾳ τοῦ μηνὸς τοῦ
    πρώτου πρὸς ἑσπέραν ποιήσετε αὐτὸ κατὰ καιρὸν αὐτοῦ· κατὰ τὸν
4 νόμον αὐτοῦ, καὶ κατὰ τὴν σύγκρισιν αὐτοῦ ποιήσεις αὐτό. Καὶ
5 ἐλάλησε Μωυσῆς τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραὴλ ποιῆσαι τὸ πάσχα· καὶ ἐποίησαν πάσχα ἐναργομένου τῇ τεσσαρεσκαιδεκάτῃ ἡμέρᾳ τοῦ μηνὸς
    πρὸς ἑσπέραν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ Σινᾶ· καθὰ συνέταξε Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ, οὕτως ἐποίησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ παρεγένοντο **οἵ** ἦσαν
    ἀκάθαρτοι ἐπὶ ψυχῇ ἀνθρώπου, καὶ οὐκ ἠδύναντο ποιῆσαι τὸ πάσχα ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ· καὶ προσῆλθον ἐναντίον Μωυσῇ καὶ
    ἐναντίον **Ἀαρὼν** ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ. Καὶ εἶπαν οἱ ἄνδρες ἐκεῖνοι
    πρὸς αὐτούς· ἡμεῖς ἀκάθαρτοι ἐπὶ ψυχῇ ἀνθρώπου· μὴ οὖν ὑστερήσωμεν ὥστε προσενέγκαι τὸ δῶρον Κυρίῳ κατὰ
8 καιρὸν αὐτοῦ ἐν μέσῳ υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ; Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτοὺς
    Μωυσῆς· στῆτε αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀκούσομαι τί ἐντελεῖται Κύριος περὶ
9 ὑμῶν. Καὶ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, λέγων· 10 λάλησον τοῖς
    υἱοῖς Ἰσραὴλ, λέγων· ἄνθρωπος ἄνθρωπος ὃς ἐὰν γένηται ἀκάθαρτος ἐπὶ ψυχῇ ἀνθρώπου, ἢ ἐν ὁδῷ μακρὰν ἢ ἐν ὑμῖν, ἢ ἐν
11 ταῖς γενεαῖς ὑμῶν, καὶ ποιήσει τὸ πάσχα τῷ Κυρίῳ, ἐν τῷ μηνὶ τῷ δευτέρῳ ἐν τῇ τεσσαρεσκαιδεκάτῃ ἡμέρᾳ πρὸς ἑσπέραν ποιήσουσιν αὐτὸ, ἐπ᾿ ἀζύμων καὶ πικρίδων φάγονται αὐτό· **εὐ** κατα-

### Literary English Translation

### NUMBERS CHAPTER EIGHT

22 [Even so they shall serve] in the tabernacle of testimony before Aaron, and before his sons; according to all that the Lord commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did they unto them.
23 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying:
24 This is the ordinance concerning the Levites: From five and twenty years old and upward, they shall enter in to perform service in the works of the tabernacle of testimony.
25 And from the age of fifty years, he shall withdraw from the service, and he shall no more be among the workers; but his brother shall minister in the tabernacle of testimony, keeping the watches, yet shall he not be [among the] workers [of actual] tasks. Thus shall you deal with the Levites in their watches.

### CHAPTER NINE

1 And the Lord spoke unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the second year of their going forth from the land of Egypt, in the first month, saying:
2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and let them keep the Passover at its appointed season.
3 On the fourteenth day of the first month, toward evening, you shall keep it according to its time; according to its law, and according to its ordinance, shall you keep it.
4 And Moses spoke unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the Passover.
5 And they kept the Passover when it was being made evident on the fourteenth day of the month, toward evening, in the wilderness of Sinai; according to all that the Lord commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.
6 And there came men who were defiled by a dead body, and they could not keep the Passover on that day; and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day.
7 And those men said unto them, "We are defiled by a dead body; why should we then be hindered, that we may not bring the offering unto the Lord at its appointed season among the children of Israel?"
8 And Moses said unto them, "Stand ye here, and I will hear what the Lord shall command concerning you."
9 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying:
10 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, "If any man, any man among you, or in a long journey, or among you, or among your generations, shall become defiled by a dead body,
11 yet shall he keep the Passover unto the Lord in the second month, on the fourteenth day, toward evening.
12 Upon unleavened bread and bitter herbs shall they eat it; well they shall leave none of it until the morning, and no bone of it shall be broken; according to all the law of the Passover shall they keep it."
