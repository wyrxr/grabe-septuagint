τῶν θεριζόντων· καὶ περιέπεσε περιπτώματι τῇ μερίδι τοῦ ἀγροῦ
Βοὸζ τοῦ ἐκ τῆς συγγενείας Ἀλιμέλεχ. Καὶ ἰδοὺ Βοὸζ ἦλθεν ἐκ **4**
Βαιθλεέμ, καὶ εἶπε τοῖς θερίζουσι· Κύριος μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν. Καὶ εἶπαν **5**
αὐτῷ· εὐλογήσαι σε Κύριος. Καὶ εἶπε Βοὸζ τῷ παιδαρίῳ αὐτοῦ **6**
τῷ ἐφεστῶτι ἐπὶ τοὺς θερίζοντας· τίνος ἡ νεᾶνις αὕτη; Καὶ **7** ἀπε-
κρίθη τὸ παιδάριον τὸ ἐφεστὸς ἐπὶ τοὺς θερίζοντας, καὶ εἶπεν· ἡ

Μωάβ. Καὶ εἶπε· συλλέξω δὴ καὶ συνάξω ἐν τοῖς δράγμασιν ὀ- **9**
πισθεν τῶν θεριζόντων· καὶ ἦλθε, καὶ ἔστη ἀπὸ πρωΐθεν καὶ ἕ-
ως ἑσπέρας, οὐ κατέπαυσεν ἐν τῷ ἀγρῷ μικρόν. Καὶ εἶπε Βοὸζ πρὸς
Ῥούθ· οὐκ ἤκουσας θύγατερ; μὴ πορευθῇς συλλέξαι ἐν ἀγρῷ ἑ-
τέρῳ, καὶ σὺ οὐ πορεύσῃ ἐντεῦθεν· ὧδε κολλήθητι μετὰ τῶν κο-
ρασίων μου. Οἱ ὀφθαλμοί σου εἰς τὸν ἀγρὸν οὗ ἐὰν θερίζωσι,
καὶ πορεύσῃ κατόπισθεν αὐτῶν· ἰδοὺ ἐνετειλάμην τοῖς παιδαρίοις,
τοῦ μὴ ἅψασθαί σου· καὶ ὅτε διψήσεις, καὶ πορευθήσῃ εἰς τὰ σκεύη,
καὶ πίεσαι ἔθεν ἂν ὑδρεύωνται τὰ παιδάρια. Καὶ ἔπεσεν ἐπὶ πρό- **10**

τόν· τί ἔτι εὗρον χάριν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς σου τοῦ ἐπιγνῶναί με, καὶ
ἐγώ εἰμι ξένη; Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Βοὸς, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ· ἀπαγγε- **11**
λία ἀπηγγέλη μοι πάντα ὅσα πεποίηκας μετὰ τῆς πενθερᾶς σου
μετὰ τὸ ἀποθανεῖν τὸν ἄνδρα σου, καὶ πῶς κατέλιπες τὸν πατέ-
ρα σου καὶ τὴν μητέρα σου καὶ τὴν γῆν γενέσεώς σου, καὶ ἐπορεύ-
θης πρὸς λαὸν, ὃν οὐκ ᾔδεις ἐχθὲς καὶ τρίτης. Ἀποτίσαι Κύριος **12**
τὴν ἐργασίαν σου, καὶ γένοιτο ὁ μισθός σου πλήρης παρὰ Κυρίου
Θεοῦ Ἰσραήλ, πρὸς ὃν ἦλθες πεποιθέναι ὑπὸ τὰς πτέρυγας αὐ-
τοῦ. Ἡ δὲ εἶπεν· εὕροιμι χάριν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς σου **κύριέ** μου, ὅτι **13**
παρεκάλεσάς με, καὶ ὅτι ἐλάλησας ἐπὶ καρδίαν τῆς δούλης σου,
καὶ ἰδοὺ **ἐγώ** ἔσομαι ὡς μία τῶν παιδισκῶν σου. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐ- **14**
τῇ Βοὸς· ἤδη ὥρα τοῦ φαγεῖν, πρόσελθε ὧδε, καὶ φάγεσαι τῶν
ἄρτων, καὶ βάψεις τὸν ψωμόν σου ἐν τῷ ὄξει. Καὶ ἐκάθισε Ῥούθ
ἐκ πλαγίων τῶν θεριζόντων· καὶ ἐβούνισεν αὐτῇ Βοὸς ἄλφιτον,
καὶ ἔφαγε, καὶ ἐνεπλήσθη, καὶ κατέλιπε· καὶ ἀνέστη τοῦ συλ- **15**

the reapers. And it befell by chance upon her that portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.
**4.** And behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, "The Lord be with you."
**5.** And they answered him, "The Lord bless you."
**6.** Then said Boaz unto his young servant who was set over the reapers, "Whose maiden is this?"
**7.** And the young servant who was set over the reapers answered and said, "It is the Moabitish maid, who returned with Naomi out of the country of Moab.
**8.** And she said, 'I will glean, and I will gather among the sheaves behind the reapers.' And she came and stood from morning until evening; she rested not even a little in the field."
**9.** And Boaz said unto Ruth, "Have you not heard, daughter? Do not go to glean in another field, and you shall not depart from here; but remain here with my maidens. Let your eyes be upon the field where they do reap, and you shall go after them. Behold, I have commanded my young men that they shall not touch you; and when you are thirsty, you shall go unto the vessels, and drink from where the young men draw water."
**10.** Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, "Why have I found favor in your sight, that you should take notice of me, seeing I am a stranger?"
**11.** And Boaz answered and said unto her, "It has been fully reported to me all that you have done unto your mother-in-law since the death of your husband; and how you did leave your father and your mother, and the land of your nativity, and have come unto a people whom you knew not before now.
**12.** The Lord shall recompense your work, and your reward shall be made full by the Lord God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to find refuge and trust."
**13.** Then she said, "Let me find favor in your sight, my lord; for you have comforted me, and for that you have spoken unto the heart of your handmaiden; and behold, I shall be as one of your maidservants."
**14.** And Boaz said unto her, "At mealtime now, draw near here, and eat of the bread, and dip your morsel in the vinegar." And Ruth sat beside the reapers: and Boaz heaped up for her parched corn, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left some.
**15.** And she rose up to glean. And Boaz commanded his young men, saying, "Let her glean even among the sheaves, and do not put her to shame;
**16.** and carrying, do you carry forth for her; and indeed, casting down, do you cast down for her from the heaped [grain], and leave [it], and she gathers [it],
