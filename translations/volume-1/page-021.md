21 ὄνομα αὐτοῦ, Ζωή, ὅτι αὕτη μήτηρ πάντων τῶν ζώντων. Καὶ ἐ-
   ποίησε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τῷ ᾿Αδὰμ καὶ τῇ γυναικὶ αὐτοῦ χιτῶνας
22 δερματίνους, καὶ ἐνέδυσεν αὐτούς. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος ὁ Θεός· ἰδοὺ
   ᾿Αδὰμ γέγονεν ὡς εἷς ἐξ ἡμῶν, τοῦ γινώσκειν καλὸν καὶ πονη-
   ρόν. Καὶ νῦν μὴ ποτε ἐκτείνῃ τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ, καὶ λάβῃ ἀπὸ
23 τοῦ ξύλου τῆς ζωῆς, καὶ φάγῃ, καὶ ζήσεται εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα. Καὶ
   ἐξαπέστειλεν αὐτὸν Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἐκ τοῦ παραδείσου τῆς τρυ-
24 φῆς, ἐργάζεσθαι τὴν γῆν ἐξ ἧς ἐλήφθη. Καὶ ἐξέβαλε τὸν ᾿Αδάμ,
   καὶ κατώκισεν αὐτὸν ἀπέναντι τοῦ παραδείσου τῆς τρυφῆς· καὶ
   ἔταξε τὰ Χερουβὶμ καὶ τὴν φλογίνην ῥομφαίαν τὴν στρεφομένην,
   φυλάσσειν τὴν ὁδὸν τοῦ ξύλου τῆς ζωῆς.

1  ΑΔΑΜ δὲ ἔγνω Εὔαν τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ· καὶ συνέλαβε, καὶ
   ἔτεκε τὸν Κάϊν. Καὶ εἶπεν· ἐκτησάμην ἄνθρωπον διὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ.
2  Καὶ προσέθηκε τεκεῖν τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ, τὸν Ἄβελ. Καὶ ἐγέ-
   νετο Ἄβελ ποιμὴν προβάτων· Κάϊν δὲ ἦν ἐργαζόμενος τὴν γῆν.
3  Καὶ ἐγένετο μεθ᾿ ἡμέρας, ἤνεγκε Κάϊν ἀπὸ τῶν καρπῶν τῆς γῆς
4  θυσίαν τῷ Κυρίῳ· καὶ Ἄβελ ἤνεγκε καὶ αὐτὸς ἀπὸ τῶν πρωτο-
   τόκων τῶν προβάτων αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν στεάτων αὐτῶν. Καὶ
5  ἐπεῖδεν ὁ Θεὸς ἐπὶ Ἄβελ καὶ ἐπὶ τοῖς δώροις αὐτοῦ· ἐπὶ δὲ Κάϊν
   καὶ ἐπὶ ταῖς θυσίαις αὐτοῦ οὐ προσέσχε. Καὶ ἐλύπησε τὸν Κάϊν
6  λίαν, καὶ συνέπεσε τῷ προσώπῳ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς
   τῷ Κάϊν· Ἵνα τί περίλυπος ἐγένου, καὶ ἵνα τί συνέπεσε τὸ πρό-
7  σωπόν σου; Οὐχ ἐὰν ὀρθῶς προσενέγκῃς, ὀρθῶς δὲ μὴ διέλῃς,
   ἥμαρτες; ἡσύχασον· πρὸς σὲ ἡ ἀποστροφὴ αὐτοῦ, καὶ σὺ ἄρξεις
8  αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπε Κάϊν πρὸς Ἄβελ τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ· διέλθωμεν
   εἰς τὸ πεδίον. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ εἶναι αὐτοὺς ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ, καὶ
   ἀνέστη Κάϊν ἐπὶ Ἄβελ τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀπέκτεινεν αὐτόν.
9  Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ Θεὸς πρὸς Κάϊν· ποῦ ἐστιν Ἄβελ ὁ ἀδελφός σου;
   Ὁ δὲ εἶπεν· οὐ γινώσκω· μὴ φύλαξ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ μου εἰμὶ ἐγώ;
10 Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ Θεός· τί ἐποίησας; φωνὴ αἵματος τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου
11 βοᾷ πρὸς με ἐκ τῆς γῆς. Καὶ ἐπικατάρατος σὺ ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς,
   ἣ ἔχανεν τὸ στόμα αὐτῆς, δέξασθαι τὸ αἷμα τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου ἐκ
12 τῆς χειρός σου. Ὅτε ἐργᾷς τὴν γῆν, καὶ οὐ προσθήσει τὴν ἰσχὺν

**Genesis 3**
21 [Her] name was Zoe, for she is the mother of all living. And the Lord God made for Adam and for his wife tunics of skin, and clothed them.
22 And the Lord God said, “Behold, Adam is become as one of Us, to know good and evil. And now, lest he stretch forth his hand, and take from
23 the tree of life, and eat, and live unto the age.” So the Lord God sent him forth from the paradise of delight, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24 And He cast out Adam, and caused him to dwell over against the paradise of delight; and He set the Cherubim and the flaming sword which turneth, to guard the way of the tree of life.

**Genesis 4**
1   Now Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain. And she said, “I have gotten a man through God.”
2   And she added to bear his brother, Abel. And Abel became a shepherd of sheep; but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
3   And it came to pass after [many] days, that Cain brought of the fruits of the ground a sacrifice unto the Lord.
4   And Abel, he also brought of the firstborn of his sheep, and of their fat.
5   And God looked upon Abel and upon his gifts; but upon Cain and upon his sacrifices, He did not regard. And it grieved Cain
6   exceedingly, and his countenance fell. And the Lord God said unto Cain, “Wherefore art thou exceedingly sorrowful, and wherefore is thy countenance fallen?
7   If thou offerest rightly, but dividest not rightly, hast thou not sinned? Be still; for unto thee is the turning thereof, and thou shalt rule over it.”
8   And Cain said unto Abel his brother, “Let us go into the plain.” And it came to pass, when they were in the plain, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.
9   And God said unto Cain, “Where is Abel thy brother?” And he said, “I know not; am I my brother’s keeper?”
10  And God said, “What hast thou done? The voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto Me from the earth.”
11  And cursed art thou from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive the blood of thy brother from
12  thy hand. When thou tillest the ground, she shall not add her strength.
