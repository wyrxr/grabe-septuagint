ΚΕΦ. ΚΑ΄. ΙΗΣΟΥΣ ΝΑΥΗ 413
Ἔτι οὐκ εἰδὼς ἐπάταξε τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐ μισῶν αὐτὸς
αὐτὸν ἐχθὲς καὶ τρίτην. Καὶ κατοικήσει ἐν τῇ πόλει ἐκείνῃ, ἕως 6
στῇ κατὰ πρόσωπον τῆς συναγωγῆς εἰς κρίσιν, ἕως ἀποθάνῃ ὁ
ἱερεὺς ὁ μέγας, ὃς ἔσται ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις· τότε ἐπιστρέφει
ὁ φονεύσας, καὶ ἐλεύσεται εἰς τὴν πόλιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ πρὸς τὸν οἶκον
αὐτοῦ, καὶ πρὸς πόλιν ὅθεν ἔφυγεν ἐκεῖθεν. Καὶ διέστειλαν τὴν 7
Κεδὲς ἐν τῇ Γαλιλαίᾳ ἐν τῷ ὄρει τῷ Νεφθαλεί, καὶ τὴν Συχὲμ ἐν
τῷ ὄρει τῷ Ἐφραίμ, καὶ τὴν πόλιν Ἀρβὰ, (αὕτη ἐστὶ Χεβρὼν) ἐν
τῷ ὄρει τῷ Ἰούδα. Καὶ ἐν τῷ πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου Ἰεριχὼ ἀπ᾿ ἀνα- 8
τολῶν ἔδωκαν τὴν Βοσὸρ ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ ἀπὸ τῆς φυλῆς
Ῥουβὴν, καὶ Ῥαμὼθ ἐν τῇ Γαλαὰδ ἐκ τῆς φυλῆς Γὰδ, καὶ τὴν
Γωλὰν ἐν τῇ Βασανίτιδι ἐκ τῆς φυλῆς Μανασσῆ. Αὗται ἦσαν αἱ πόλεις 9
αἱ ἐπίκλητοι πᾶσι τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραὴλ καὶ τῷ προσηλύτῳ τῷ προσκει-
μένῳ ἐν αὐτοῖς, καταφυγεῖν ἐκεῖ παντὶ παίοντι ψυχὴν ἀκουσίως,
ἵνα μὴ ἀποθάνῃ ἐκ χειρὸς τοῦ ἀγχιστεύοντος τὸ αἷμα, ἕως ἂν
καταστῇ ἔναντι τῆς συναγωγῆς εἰς κρίσιν.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΑ΄. ΧΧΙ.

ΚΑΙ προσῆλθον οἱ ἀρχιπατριῶται τῶν υἱῶν Λευὶ πρὸς Ἐλεά- 1
ζαρ τὸν ἱερέα, καὶ πρὸς Ἰησοῦν τὸν τοῦ Ναυῆ, καὶ πρὸς τοὺς ἀρχι-
φύλους πατριῶν ἐκ τῶν φυλῶν τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς 2
αὐτοὺς ἐν Σηλὼ ἐν γῇ Χαναὰν, λέγοντες· ἐνετείλατο Κύριος ἐν χειρὶ
Μωυσῆ, δοῦναι ἡμῖν πόλεις κατοικεῖν, καὶ τὰ περισπόρια αὐτῶν τοῖς
κτήνεσιν ἡμῶν. Καὶ ἔδωκαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ τοῖς Λευίταις, ἐν τῷ 3
κατακληρονομεῖν αὐτοὺς, διὰ προστάγματος Κυρίου τὰς πόλεις
ταύτας καὶ τὰ περισπόρια αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ὁ κλῆρος τῷ δήμῳ 4
Καὰθ, καὶ ἐγένετο τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἀαρὼν τοῖς ἱερεῦσι τοῖς Λευίταις ἀπὸ
φυλῆς Ἰούδα καὶ ἀπὸ φυλῆς Συμεὼν καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς φυλῆς Βενιαμὶν
κληρωτὶ πόλεις δεκατρεῖς· καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς Καὰθ τοῖς καταλελειμ- 5

ἀπὸ τοῦ ἡμίσους φυλῆς Μανασσῆ κληρωτὶ πόλεις δέκα. Καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς 6

καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς φυλῆς Νεφθαλὶ καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἡμίσους φυλῆς Μανασσῆ ἐν τῇ

**Joshua 20**

<sup>5</sup> And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not deliver the manslayer into his hand; [forasmuch as] he smote his neighbor unwittingly, and had not hated him aforetime.
<sup>6</sup> And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the assembly for judgment, [and] until the great priest die, who shall be in those days. Then shall the manslayer return, and he shall come unto his city, and unto his house, even unto the city from whence he fled thence.
<sup>7</sup> And they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the mountain of Naphtali, and Shechem in the mountain of Ephraim, and the city of Arba (this is Hebron) in the mountain of Judah.
<sup>8</sup> And beyond the Jordan [by] Jericho, from the east, they gave Bosor in the wilderness, in the plain, from the tribe of Reuben; and Ramoth in Gilead from the tribe of Gad; and Golan in Bashan from the tribe of Manasseh.
<sup>9</sup> These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel, and for the stranger who sojourneth among them, to flee thither, whosoever smiteth a soul unwittingly, that he might not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stand before the assembly for judgment.
