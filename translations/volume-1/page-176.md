ΚΕΦ. ΛΕ. ΕΞΟΔΟΣ 161
πᾶσαν συναγωγὴν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, λέγων τοῦτο τὸ ῥῆμα, ὃ συνέταξε Κύριος, λέγων· λάβετε παρ’ ὑμῶν αὐτῶν ἀφαίρεμα Κυρίῳ·
πᾶς δ’ ὁ καταδεχόμενος τῇ καρδίᾳ, οἴσουσι τὰς ἀπαρχὰς Κυρίῳ,
χρυσίον, ἀργύριον, χαλκόν, ὑάκινθον, πορφύραν, κόκκινον διπλοῦν διανενησμένον, καὶ βύσσον κεκλωσμένην, καὶ τρίχας αἰγείας, καὶ
δέρματα κριῶν ἐρυθροδανωμένα, καὶ δέρματα ὑακίνθινα, καὶ ξύλα ἄσηπτα· καὶ ἔλαιον εἰς τὴν φαῦσιν, καὶ θυμίαμα εἰς τὸ ἔλαιον τῆς
χρίσεως καὶ εἰς τὴν σύνθεσιν τοῦ θυμιάματος· καὶ λίθους σαρδίου, καὶ λίθους εἰς τὴν γλυφὴν εἰς τὴν ἐπωμίδα καὶ εἰς τὸν ποδήρη.
Καὶ πᾶς σοφὸς τῇ διανοίᾳ ἐν ὑμῖν, ἐλθὼν ἐργαζέσθω πάντα ὅσα συνέταξε Κύριος· τὴν σκηνήν, καὶ τὰ παραρύματα, καὶ
τὰ καλύμματα, καὶ τὰ διατόνια, καὶ τοὺς πασσάλους, καὶ τοὺς μοχλούς, καὶ τοὺς στύλους, καὶ τὰς βάσεις· καὶ τὴν κιβωτὸν τοῦ
μαρτυρίου, καὶ τοὺς ἀναφορεῖς αὐτῆς, καὶ τὸ ἱλαστήριον αὐτῆς, καὶ τὸ καταπέτασμα· (καὶ τὰ ἱστία τῆς αὐλῆς, καὶ τοὺς στύλους αὐτῆς, καὶ τοὺς λίθους τοὺς τῆς σμαράγδου, καὶ τὰ θυμιάματα, καὶ τὸ ἔλαιον τοῦ χρίσματος·) καὶ τὴν τράπεζαν καὶ τοὺς ἀναφορεῖς αὐτῆς, καὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη αὐτῆς, καὶ τοὺς ἄρτους τῆς
προθέσεως· (καὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον καὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ) καὶ τὴν λυχνίαν τοῦ φωτός, καὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη αὐτῆς, καὶ τοὺς
λύχνους αὐτῆς, καὶ τὸ ἔλαιον τοῦ φωτός· καὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον τοῦ θυμιάματος, καὶ τοὺς ἀναφορεῖς αὐτοῦ· καὶ τὸ ἔλαιον τῆς
χρίσεως, καὶ τὸ θυμίαμα τῆς συνθέσεως· καὶ τὸ ἐπίσπαστρον τῆς θύρας τῆς σκηνῆς· καὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον τοῦ ὁλοκαυτώματος, καὶ
τὴν ἐσχάραν αὐτοῦ τὴν χαλκῆν, καὶ τοὺς ἀναφορεῖς αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ· καὶ τὸν λουτῆρα, καὶ τὴν βάσιν αὐτοῦ·
καὶ τὰ ἱστία τῆς αὐλῆς, καὶ τοὺς στύλους αὐτῆς, καὶ τὰς βάσεις αὐτῆς, καὶ τὸ ἐπίσπαστρον τῆς θύρας τῆς αὐλῆς· καὶ τοὺς
πασσάλους τῆς σκηνῆς, καὶ τοὺς πασσάλους τῆς αὐλῆς, καὶ τὰ σχοινία αὐτῶν· καὶ τὰς στολὰς τὰς ἁγίας Ἀαρὼν τοῦ ἱερέως, καὶ
τὰς στολὰς ἐν αἷς λειτουργοῦσιν ἐν αὐταῖς ἐν τῷ ἁγίῳ, καὶ τοὺς χιτῶνας τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἀαρὼν τῆς ἱερατείας· (καὶ τὸ ἔλαιον τοῦ χρίσματος, καὶ τὸ θυμίαμα τῆς συνθέσεως).
Καὶ ἐξῆλθε πᾶσα συναγωγὴ υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ ἀπὸ Μωυσῆ. Καὶ ἤνεγκαν ἕκαστος ὧν ἔφερεν ἡ καρδία αὐτῶν, καὶ οἷς ἔδοξε τῇ ψυχῇ αὐτῶν, ἤνεγκαν ἀφαίρεμα Κυρίῳ εἰς πάντα τὰ ἔργα τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου,

<p><sup>4</sup> And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the sons of Israel, saying this word, which the LORD hath commanded, saying: <sup>5</sup> Take ye from among yourselves an offering unto the LORD. Every man whose heart is willing shall bring forth the first-fruits unto the LORD: <sup>6</sup> gold, and silver, and bronze; and hyacinth, and purple, and scarlet [yarn] of double dye, <sup>7</sup> finely spun, and twined fine linen, and goats’ hair; <sup>8</sup> and rams’ skins dyed red, and skins of hyacinthine hue, and incorruptible wood; <sup>9</sup> and oil for the light, and incense for the anointing oil, and for the composition of the incense; and sardius stones, and stones for engraving, for the ephod, and for the long robe. <sup>10</sup> And every man who is wise in heart among you, let him come and perform all [things] <sup>11</sup> whatsoever the Lord hath commanded: the tabernacle, and its curtains, and its coverings, and its bars, and its pegs, and its staves, and its pillars, and its bases; <sup>12</sup> and the ark of the testimony, and its staves, and its mercy seat, and the veil; (and the hangings of the court, and its pillars, and the emerald stones, and the incenses, and the oil of anointing;) <sup>13</sup> and the table and its staves, and all its vessels, and the bread of the Presence; (and the altar and all its vessels;) <sup>14</sup> and the lampstand for the light, and all its vessels, and its lamps, and the oil for the light; <sup>15</sup> and the altar of incense, and its staves; and the oil of anointing, and the incense of the composition; and the screen for the door of the tabernacle; <sup>16</sup> and the altar of the burnt offering, and its bronze grating, and its staves, and all its vessels; <sup>17</sup> and the laver, and its base; and the hangings of the court, and its pillars, and its bases, <sup>18</sup> and the screen for the door of the court; and the pegs of the tabernacle, and the pegs of the court, and their ropes; <sup>19</sup> and the holy garments of Aaron the priest, and the garments wherein they minister in the Holy [Place], and the tunics for the sons of Aaron for the priesthood; (and the oil of anointing, and the incense of the composition).</p>

<p><sup>20</sup> And all the congregation of the sons of Israel went forth from the presence of Moses. <sup>21</sup> And every man whose heart moved him, and whose soul was willing, brought an offering unto the Lord for all the work of the tabernacle of the testimony,</p>
