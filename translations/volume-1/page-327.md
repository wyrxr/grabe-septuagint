**Original Greek Text (with light OCR corrections):**

29 τοῖς ποσίμου, (καθὼς ἐποίησάν μοι οἱ υἱοὶ Ἡσαῦ οἱ κατοικοῦντες ἐν Σηεὶρ, καὶ οἱ Μωαβῖται οἱ κατοικοῦντες ἐν Ἀροήρ,) ἕως ἂν παρέλθω τὸν
30 Ἰορδάνην εἰς τὴν γῆν, ἣν Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν δίδωσιν ἡμῖν. Καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησε Σηὼν βασιλεὺς Ἑσεβὼν παρελθεῖν ἡμᾶς δι᾿ αὐτοῦ, ὅτι ἐσκλήρυνε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν τὸ πνεῦμα αὐτοῦ, καὶ κατίσχυσε τὴν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ, ἵνα παραδοθῇ εἰς τὰς χεῖράς σου
31 ὡς ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ταύτῃ. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς με· ἰδοὺ ἤργμαι παραδοῦναι πρὸ προσώπου σου τὸν Σηὼν βασιλέα Ἑσεβὼν τὸν Ἀμοῤῥαῖον, καὶ τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ, ἔναρξαι κληρονομῆσαι τὴν γῆν
32 αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐξῆλθε Σηὼν βασιλεὺς Ἑσεβὼν εἰς συνάντησιν ἡμῖν, αὐτὸς καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς αὐτοῦ εἰς πόλεμον εἰς Ἰασσᾶ.
33 Καὶ παρέδωκεν αὐτὸν Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν πρὸ προσώπου ἡμῶν, καὶ ἐπατάξαμεν αὐτὸν καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ καὶ πάντα τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ·
34 καὶ ἐκρατήσαμεν πασῶν τῶν πόλεων αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ, καὶ ἐξωλεθρεύσαμεν πᾶσαν πόλιν ἑξῆς, καὶ τὰς γυναῖκας αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ τέκνα αὐτῶν, οὐ κατελείπομεν ζωγρίαν πλὴν τὰ
35 κτήνη προενομεύσαμεν αὐτοῖς, καὶ τὰ σκῦλα τῶν πόλεων ἐλάβομεν.
36 Ἀπὸ Ἀροήρ, ἡ ἐστι παρὰ τὸ χεῖλος χειμάῤῥου Ἀρνῶν, καὶ τὴν πόλιν τὴν οὖσαν ἐν τῇ φάραγγι, καὶ ἕως ὄρους τοῦ Γαλαὰδ, οὐκ ἦν πόλις, ἥτις διέφυγεν ἡμᾶς· τὰς πάσας παρέδωκε
37 Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν εἰς τὰς χεῖρας ἡμῶν. Πλὴν εἰς γῆν υἱῶν Ἀμμὰν οὐ προσήλθαμεν, πάντα τὰ συγκυροῦντα χειμάῤῥῳ Ἰαβὲκ καὶ τὰς πόλεις τὰς ἐν τῇ ὀρεινῇ, καθότι ἐνετείλατο ἡμῖν Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν.

**ΚΕΦ. Γ΄. III.**

1 ΚΑΙ ἐπιστραφέντες ἀνέβημεν ὁδὸν τὴν εἰς Βασὰν καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Ὤγ βασιλεὺς τῆς Βασὰν εἰς συνάντησιν ἡμῖν, αὐτὸς καὶ πᾶς ὁ
2 λαὸς αὐτοῦ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ εἰς πόλεμον εἰς Ἐδραείν. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς με· μὴ φοβηθῇς αὐτὸν, ὅτι εἰς τὰς χεῖράς σου παραδέδωκα αὐτὸν, καὶ πάντα τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ· καὶ ποιήσεις αὐτῷ, ὥσπερ ἐποίησας τῷ Σηὼν βασιλεῖ τῶν
3 Ἀμοῤῥαίων, ὃς κατώκει ἐν Ἑσεβών. Καὶ παρέδωκεν αὐτὸν Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν εἰς τὰς χεῖρας ἡμῶν (αὐτὸν) καὶ τὸν Ὤγ βασιλέα τῆς Βασὰν, καὶ πάντα τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐπατάξαμεν αὐτὸν

**English Translation:**

### DEUTERONOMY CHAPTER II. III.

^29 to the potable ones, (even as did unto me the sons of Esau, who dwelt in Seir, and the Moabites, who abode in Ar,) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God doth give unto us.

^30 But Sihon, king of Heshbon, would not suffer us to pass through by him; for the LORD your God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that He might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day.

^31 And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to deliver before thy face Sihon the king of Heshbon, the Amorite, and his land: begin thou to inherit his land.

^32 Then Sihon, king of Heshbon, came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Jahaz.

^33 And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.

^34 And we took all his cities at that time; and we utterly destroyed every city in succession, both their women and their children; we left not one alive,

^35 save that the cattle we took as spoil for them, and the plunder of the cities we laid hold upon.

^36 From Aroer, which is by the bank of the River Arnon, and the city that is in the valley, even unto Mount Gilead, there was no city that escaped us; all of them the LORD our God delivered into our hands.

^37 Only unto the land of the children of Ammon did we not approach, nor unto all the region near the River Jabbok, nor unto the cities that are in the mountains; for so the LORD our God commanded us.

### CHAPTER III.

^1 Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan; and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, unto battle at Edrei.

^2 And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not; for I have delivered him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.

^3 So the LORD our God delivered into our hands him, (even) Og the king of Bashan, and all his people; and we smote him.
