#### ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ ΚΕΦ. ΜΗ΄.

10 Θεὸς ἐνταῦθα. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰακώβ· προσάγαγέ μοι αὐτούς, ἵνα εὐλογήσω αὐτούς. Οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ δὲ αὐτοῦ ἐβαρύνθησαν ἀπὸ τοῦ γήρως, καὶ οὐκ ἐδύναντο βλέπειν· καὶ ἤγγισε (δὲ) αὐτοὺς πρὸς αὐτόν, καὶ ἐφίλησεν αὐτούς, καὶ περιέλαβεν αὐτούς.
11 Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς Ἰωσήφ· ἰδοὺ τοῦ προσώπου σου οὐκ ἐστερήθην, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἔδειξέ μοι ὁ Θεὸς καὶ τὸ σπέρμα σου.
12 Καὶ ἐξήγαγεν αὐτοὺς Ἰωσὴφ ἀπὸ τῶν γονάτων αὐτοῦ, καὶ προσεκύνησεν αὐτῷ ἐπὶ πρόσωπον ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς.
13 Λαβὼν δὲ Ἰωσὴφ τοὺς δύο υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ, τόν τε Ἐφραὶμ ἐν τῇ δεξιᾷ, ἐξ ἀριστερῶν δὲ Ἰσραὴλ, τὸν δὲ Μανασσὴ ἐν τῇ ἀριστερᾷ, ἐκ δεξιῶν δὲ Ἰσραὴλ, ἤγγισεν αὐτοὺς αὐτῷ.
14 Ἐκτείνας δὲ Ἰσραὴλ τὴν χεῖρα τὴν δεξιάν, ἐπέβαλεν ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν Ἐφραὶμ, (οὗτος δὲ ἦν ὁ νεώτερος) καὶ τὴν ἀριστερὰν ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν Μανασσῆ, ἐναλλάξας τὰς χεῖρας.
15 Καὶ ηὐλόγησεν αὐτούς, καὶ εἶπεν· ὁ Θεὸς, ᾧ εὐηρέστησαν οἱ πατέρες μου ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ, Ἀβραὰμ καὶ Ἰσαὰκ, ὁ Θεὸς ὁ τρέφων με ἐκ νεότητός μου ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης,
16 ὁ ἄγγελος ὁ ῥυόμενός με ἐκ πάντων τῶν κακῶν, εὐλογήσαι τὰ παιδία ταῦτα, καὶ ἐπικληθήσεται ἐν αὐτοῖς τὸ ὄνομά μου, καὶ τὸ ὄνομα τῶν πατέρων μου, Ἀβραὰμ καὶ Ἰσαάκ· καὶ πληθυνθείησαν εἰς πλῆθος πολὺ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς.
17 Ἰδὼν δὲ Ἰωσὴφ ὅτι ἐπέβαλεν ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ τὴν χεῖρα τὴν δεξιὰν αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν Ἐφραὶμ, βαρὺ αὐτῷ κατεφάνη· καὶ ἀντελάβετο Ἰωσὴφ τῆς χειρὸς τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ, ἀφελεῖν αὐτὴν ἀπὸ τῆς κεφαλῆς Ἐφραὶμ ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν Μανασσῆ.
18 Εἶπε δὲ Ἰωσὴφ τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ· οὐχ οὕτως πάτερ, οὗτος γὰρ ὁ πρωτότοκος· ἐπίθες τὴν δεξιάν σου ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ.
19 Καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησεν, ἀλλ᾿ εἶπεν· οἶδα τέκνον, οἶδα· καὶ οὗτος ἔσται εἰς λαὸν, καὶ οὗτος ὑψωθήσεται· ἀλλὰ ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ ὁ νεώτερος μείζων αὐτοῦ ἔσται, καὶ τὸ σπέρμα αὐτοῦ ἔσται εἰς πλῆθος ἐθνῶν.
20 Καὶ ηὐλόγησεν αὐτοὺς ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, λέγων· ἐν ὑμῖν εὐλογηθήσεται Ἰσραὴλ, λέγοντες· ποιήσαι σε ὁ Θεὸς ὡς Ἐφραὶμ καὶ ὡς Μανασσῆ. Καὶ ἔθηκε τὸν Ἐφραὶμ ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ Μανασσῆ.
21 Εἶπε δὲ Ἰσραὴλ τῷ Ἰωσήφ· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἀποθνήσκω, καὶ ἔσται ὁ Θεὸς μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν, καὶ ἀποστρέψει ὑμᾶς ἐκ τῆς γῆς ταύτης εἰς τὴν γῆν τῶν πατέρων ὑμῶν.
22 Ἐγὼ δὲ δίδωμί σοι Σίκιμα ἐξαίρετον ὑπὲρ τοὺς ἀδελφούς σου, ἣν ἔλαβον ἐκ χειρὸς Ἀμοῤῥαίων ἐν μαχαίρᾳ μου καὶ τόξῳ.

#### GENESIS CHAPTER 48

10 God is here.” And Jacob said, “Bring them unto me, that I may bless them.” Now the eyes of Jacob were heavy from old age, and he could not see. So he brought them nigh unto him, and he kissed them, and embraced them.
11 And Israel said unto Joseph, “Behold, I was not deprived of thy face, and lo, God hath shown me also thy seed.”
12 And Joseph brought them forth from his knees, and bowed himself with his face to the earth.
13 And Joseph took his two sons, Ephraim in his right hand, at Israel’s left [side], and Manasseh in his left hand, at Israel’s right [side], and he brought them near unto him.
14 But Israel stretched forth his right hand and laid it upon the head of Ephraim (for he was the younger), and his left hand upon the head of Manasseh, crossing his hands.
15 And he blessed them, and said, “The God before whom my fathers, Abraham and Isaac, did walk, the God who hath fed me from my youth even until this day,
16 the Angel who hath redeemed me from all evil, bless these children; and let my name be called upon them, and the name of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a great multitude upon the earth.”
17 Now when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it seemed grievous unto him; and Joseph took hold of his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s head and [place it] upon the head of Manasseh.
18 And Joseph said unto his father, “Not so, my father, for this is the firstborn; lay thy right hand upon his head.”
19 But he refused, and said, “I know, my son, I know. This one also shall become a people, and he also shall be exalted; but his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.”
20 And he blessed them that day, saying, “By you shall Israel bless, saying, ‘May God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh.’” And thus he set Ephraim before Manasseh.
21 And Israel said unto Joseph, “Behold, I die; but God shall be with you, and He shall bring you again out of this land unto the land of your fathers.”
22 Moreover, I give unto thee Shechem as one choice portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorites with my sword and with my bow.
