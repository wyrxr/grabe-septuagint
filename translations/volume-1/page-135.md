120 ΕΞΟΔΟΣ ΚΕΦ. ΙΔʹ.
22 τοῖς. Οὐκ ἐξέλειπεν ὁ στύλος τῆς νεφέλης ἡμέρας, καὶ ὁ στύλος
τοῦ πυρὸς νυκτός, ἐναντίον παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΔʹ. XIV.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν λέγων· 2 λάλησον τοῖς
υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἀποστρέψαντες στρατοπεδευσάτωσαν ἀπέναντι τῆς
ἐπαύλεως, ἀνὰ μέσον Μαγδώλου καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον τῆς θαλάσσης·
ἐξεναντίας Βεελσεπφών· ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν στρατοπεδεύσεις ἐπὶ τῆς
3 θαλάσσης. Καὶ ἐρεῖ Φαραὼ τῷ λαῷ αὐτοῦ περὶ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ· πλανῶνται οὗτοι ἐν τῇ γῇ, συγκέκλεικεν αὐτοὺς ἡ ἔρημος.
4 Ἐγὼ δὲ σκληρυνῶ τὴν καρδίαν Φαραώ, καὶ καταδιώξεται ὀπίσω
αὐτῶν· καὶ ἐνδοξασθήσομαι ἐν Φαραώ, καὶ ἐν πάσῃ τῇ στρατιᾷ
αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπιγνώσονται πάντες οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι, ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι Κύριος.
5 Καὶ ἐποίησαν οὕτως. Καὶ ἀνηγγέλη τῷ βασιλεῖ τῶν Αἰγυπτίων (λέγοντες), ὅτι πέφευγεν ὁ λαός· καὶ μετεστράφη ἡ καρδία Φαραὼ καὶ τῶν θεραπόντων αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὸν λαόν, καὶ εἶπον·
τί τοῦτο πεποιήκαμεν, τοῦ ἐξαποστεῖλαι τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραήλ, τοῦ
6 μὴ δουλεύειν ἡμῖν; Ἔζευξεν οὖν Φαραὼ τὰ ἅρματα αὐτοῦ, καὶ
7 πάντα τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ συναπήγαγε μεθ᾿ ἑαυτοῦ· καὶ ἔλαβεν ἑξακόσια ἅρματα ἐκλεκτά, καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν ἵππον τῶν Αἰγυπτίων, καὶ
8 τριστάτας ἐπὶ πάντων. Καὶ ἐσκλήρυνε Κύριος τὴν καρδίαν Φαραὼ βασιλέως Αἰγύπτου, (καὶ τὴν καρδίαν τῶν θεραπόντων αὐτοῦ,) καὶ κατεδίωξεν ὀπίσω τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ· οἱ δὲ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ
9 ἐξεπορεύοντο ἐν χειρὶ ὑψηλῇ. Καὶ κατεδίωξαν οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι ὀπίσω
αὐτῶν, καὶ εὗρον αὐτοὺς παρεμβεβληκότας παρὰ τὴν θάλασσαν·
καὶ πᾶσα ἡ ἵππος καὶ τὰ ἅρματα Φαραώ, καὶ οἱ ἱππεῖς, καὶ ἡ
10 στρατιὰ αὐτοῦ ἀπέναντι τῆς ἐπαύλεως, ἐξεναντίας Βεελσεπφῶν. Καὶ
Φαραὼ προσήγαγε· καὶ ἀναβλέψαντες οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς, ὁρῶσι, καὶ ἴδε, οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι ἐστρατοπέδευσαν ὀπίσω αὐτῶν,
καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν σφόδρα· ἀνεβόησαν δὲ οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς Κύριον.
11 Καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς Μωυσῆν· παρὰ τὸ μὴ ὑπάρχειν μνήματα ἐν (γῇ)
Αἰγύπτῳ, ἐξήγαγες ἡμᾶς θανατῶσαι (ἡμᾶς) ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ; τί
12 τοῦτο ἐποίησας ἡμῖν, ἐξαγαγὼν ἡμᾶς ἐξ Αἰγύπτου; Οὐ τοῦτο ἦν
τὸ ῥῆμα, ὃ ἐλαλήσαμεν πρός σε ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ, λέγοντες· πάρες
ἡμᾶς, ὅπως δουλεύσωμεν τοῖς Αἰγυπτίοις· κρεῖσσον γὰρ ἡμᾶς δουλεύειν.

**EXODUS. CHAPTER 14.**

**22** Neither did the pillar of cloud by day depart, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before all the people.

**CHAPTER XIV.**

**1** And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
**2** "Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before the house, between Magdol and between the sea, opposite Baal-zephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea.
**3** And Pharaoh shall say unto his people concerning the children of Israel, ‘These do wander in the land; the wilderness hath shut them in.’
**4** And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he shall pursue after them; and I will be glorified in Pharaoh, and in all his army; and all the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord."
**5** And they did so. And it was told unto the king of the Egyptians (saying), that the people were fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, "What is this that we have done, that we have sent away the children of Israel, that they should not serve us?"
**6** So Pharaoh made ready his chariots, and
**7** took all his people with him: and he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the cavalry of the Egyptians, and three captains over all of them.
**8** And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, (and the heart of his servants), and he pursued after the children of Israel: but the children of Israel went out with a high hand.
**9** And the Egyptians pursued after them, and found them encamped by the sea; and all the cavalry and chariots of Pharaoh, and the horsemen, and his army, [were] before the house, opposite Baal-zephon.
**10** And Pharaoh drew nigh: and the children of Israel, lifting up their eyes, beheld, and lo, the Egyptians encamped behind them; and they feared exceedingly: and the children of Israel cried out unto the Lord.
**11** And they said unto Moses, "Is it because there were no graves in [the land of] Egypt that thou hast brought us out to slay [us] in the wilderness? What is this that thou hast done unto us, bringing us forth out of Egypt?
**12** Was not this the word that we spake unto thee in Egypt, saying, ‘Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians’? For it were better for us to serve the Egyptians."
