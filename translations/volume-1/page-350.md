#### Original Text with light OCR corrections:

ΚΕΦ. ΙΓ´ ΔΕΥΤΕΡΟΝΟΜΙΟΝ 335
**5** Ἰδοὺ ἧς ἐνετείλατό σοι Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου, πορεύεσθαι ἐν αὐτῇ·
καὶ ἀφανιεῖτε τὸν πονηρὸν ἐξ ὑμῶν αὐτῶν. **6** Ἐὰν δὲ παρακαλέσῃ
σε ὁ ἀδελφός σου ἐκ πατρός σου ἢ ἐκ μητρός σου, ἢ ὁ υἱός σου,
ἢ ἡ θυγάτηρ σου, ἢ ἡ γυνή σου ἡ ἐν κόλπῳ σου, ἢ ὁ φίλος σου
ὁ ἴσος τῇ ψυχῇ σου, λάθρα λέγων· πορευθῶμεν καὶ λατρεύσωμεν
θεοῖς ἑτέροις, οἷς οὐκ ᾔδεις σὺ καὶ οἱ πατέρες σου, **7** ἀπὸ τῶν
θεῶν τῶν ἐθνῶν τῶν περὶ κύκλῳ ὑμῶν, τῶν ἐγγιζόντων σοι ἢ
τῶν μακρὰν ἀπὸ σοῦ, ἀπ’ ἄκρου τῆς γῆς ἕως ἄκρου τῆς γῆς,
**8** οὐ συνθελήσεις αὐτῷ, καὶ οὐκ εἰσακούσῃ αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐ φείσεται
ὁ ὀφθαλμός σου ἐπ’ αὐτῷ, καὶ οὐκ ἐπιποθήσεις ἐπ’ αὐτῷ, οὐδὲ
μὴ σκεπάσῃς ἐπ’ αὐτόν· **9** ἀναγγέλλων ἀναγγελεῖς περὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ
ἡ χείρ σου ἔσται ἐπ’ αὐτῷ ἐν πρώτοις, ἀποκτεῖναι αὐτόν, καὶ
**10** αἱ χεῖρες παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ ἐπ’ ἐσχάτῳ· καὶ λιθοβολήσουσιν αὐτὸν
ἐν λίθοις, καὶ ἀποθανεῖται, ὅτι ἐζήτησεν ἀποστῆσαί σε ἀπὸ Κυρίου
τοῦ Θεοῦ σου, τοῦ ἐξαγαγόντος σε ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, ἐξ
**11** οἴκου δουλείας· καὶ πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ ἀκούσας φοβηθήσεται, καὶ οὐ
προσθήσουσιν ἔτι ποιῆσαι κατὰ τὸ πονηρὸν ῥῆμα τοῦτο ἐν ὑμῖν.
**12** Ἐὰν δὲ ἀκούσῃς ἐν μιᾷ τῶν πόλεών σου, ὧν Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου
δίδωσί σοι, κατοικεῖν ἐκεῖ, λεγόντων· **13** ἐξῆλθον ἄνδρες παράνομοι
ἐξ ὑμῶν, καὶ ἀπέστησαν πάντας τοὺς κατοικοῦντας τὴν πόλιν αὐτῶν,
λέγοντες· πορευθῶμεν, καὶ λατρεύσωμεν θεοῖς ἑτέροις οἷς οὐκ
**14** ᾔδειτε, καὶ ἐξετάσεις καὶ ἐρωτήσεις καὶ ἐξερευνήσεις σφόδρα, καὶ
ἰδοὺ ἀληθὴς σαφῶς ὁ λόγος, γεγένηται τὸ βδέλυγμα τοῦτο ἐν ὑμῖν,
**15** ἀνελὼν ἀνελεῖς πάντας τοὺς κατοικοῦντας ἐν τῇ πόλει ἐκείνῃ ἐν φόνῳ
μαχαίρας· ἀναθέματι ἀναθεματιεῖτε αὐτήν, καὶ πάντα τὰ ἐν αὐτῇ, καὶ
**16** τὰ κτήνη αὐτῆς, ἐν στόματι μαχαίρας· καὶ πάντα τὰ σκῦλα αὐτῆς συνάξεις
εἰς τὰς διόδους αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐμπρήσεις τὴν πόλην ἐν πυρί, καὶ
πάντα τὰ σκῦλα αὐτῆς πανδημεὶ ἔναντι Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ σου· καὶ
**17** ἔσται ἀοίκητος εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, οὐκ ἀνοικοδομηθήσεται ἔτι. Οὐ προσκολληθήσεται
οὐδὲν ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀναθέματος ἐν τῇ χειρί σου, ἵνα ἀποστραφῇ
Κύριος ἀπὸ θυμοῦ τῆς ὀργῆς αὐτοῦ· καὶ δώσει σοι ἔλεος, καὶ
**18** πληθυνεῖ σε, καὶ ἐλεήσει σε, (καὶ πληθήσῃ, καθὼς ἐλάλησέ σοι)
ὃν τρόπον ὤμοσε Κύριος τοῖς πατράσι σου, ἐὰν (δὲ) εἰσακούσῃς τῆς
φωνῆς Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ σου φυλάσσειν πάσας τὰς ἐντολὰς αὐτοῦ,
ἃς ἐγὼ ἐντέλλομαί σοι σήμερον, ποιεῖν τὸ καλὸν καὶ τὸ ἀρεστὸν ἔναντι
Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ σου.

#### Literary English Translation:

**5** Behold, this is that which the Lord thy God hath commanded thee, to walk therein;
and ye shall utterly destroy the wicked from among yourselves.
**6** If thy brother, [be he] of thy father or of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter,
or thy wife who lieth in thy bosom, or thy friend who is as thine own soul,
shall entice thee secretly, saying:
"Let us go and serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known,"
**7** [even] of the gods of the nations which are round about you,
whether they be nigh unto thee, or far off from thee,
from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth;
**8** Thou shalt not consent unto him, neither shalt thou hearken unto him;
neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou long for him,
nor shalt thou conceal him.
**9** But thou shalt surely make report concerning him, and thy hand shall be upon him first to slay him,
**10** and the hands of all the people at the last.
And they shall stone him with stones, and he shall die;
because he hath sought to turn thee away from the Lord thy God,
who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the
**11** house of bondage.
And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall no more commit any such wicked thing among you.

**12** If thou shalt hear in one of thy cities,
which the Lord thy God giveth thee to dwell there, [men] saying,
**13** "There are gone out lawless men from among you,
and have withdrawn all the inhabitants of their city, saying,
‘Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known;’"
**14** Then shalt thou enquire, and make search, and examine diligently.
And behold, [if] the report be true and certain, that this abomination hath been wrought among you,
**15** Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword;
thou shalt utterly devote it to destruction, and all that is therein,
and its cattle, with the edge of the sword.
**16** And all the spoil thereof shalt thou gather into the midst of its public squares,
and shalt burn the city with fire,
and all the spoil thereof wholly as a burnt offering in the sight of the Lord thy God.
**17** And it shall be an uninhabited [ruin] for ever; it shall not be built again.
And there shall cleave naught of the accursed thing to thine hand,
that the Lord may turn from the fierceness of His anger,
and grant thee mercy, and
**18** multiply thee, and have mercy upon thee (and thou shalt multiply, as He spake unto thee),
as the Lord hath sworn unto thy fathers;
if (then) thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God,
to keep all His commandments which I command thee this day,
to do that which is good and pleasing in the sight of the Lord thy God.
