41 καὶ θυγατέρας γεννήσεις, καὶ οὐκ ἔσονταί σοι· ἀπελεύσονται γὰρ
ἐν αἰχμαλωσίᾳ.
42 Πάντα τὰ ξύλινά σου, καὶ τὰ γεννήματά σου τῆς
γῆς ἐξαναλώσει ἡ ἐρυσίβη.
43 Ὁ προσήλυτος ὃς ἐστιν ἐν σοί, ἀνα-
βήσεται ἐπὶ σὲ ἄνω ἄνω, σὺ δὲ καταβήσῃ κάτω κάτω·
44 οὗτος δα-
νειεῖ σοι, σὺ δὲ τούτῳ οὐ δανειεῖς· οὗτος ἔσται εἰς κεφαλήν, σὺ δὲ
ἔσῃ εἰς οὐράν.
45 Καὶ ἐλεύσονται ἐπὶ σὲ πᾶσαι αἱ κατάραι αὗται,
καὶ καταδιώξονταί σε, καὶ καταλήψονταί σε, ἕως ἂν ἐξολοθρεύσαι
σε, καὶ ἕως ἂν ἀπολέσαι σε·
46 ὅτι οὐκ ἤκουσας τῆς φωνῆς Κυρίου
τοῦ Θεοῦ σου, τοῦ φυλάσσεσθαι (σε πάσας) τὰς ἐντολὰς αὐτοῦ καὶ
τὰ δικαιώματα αὐτοῦ, ὅσα ἐνετείλατό σοι.
47 Καὶ ἔσται ἐν σοι ση-
μεῖα καὶ τέρατα, καὶ ἐν τῷ σπέρματί σου ἕως αἰῶνος· ἀνθ’ ὧν
οὐκ ἐλάτρευσας Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ σου ἐν εὐφροσύνῃ καὶ ἐν ἀγαθῇ
καρδίᾳ διὰ τὸ πλῆθος πάντων.
48 Καὶ λατρεύσεις τοῖς ἐχθροῖς σου,
οἷς ἐπαποστελεῖ αὐτοὺς Κύριος ἐπὶ σέ, ἐν λιμῷ, καὶ ἐν δίψει, καὶ
ἐν γυμνότητι, καὶ ἐν ἐκλείψει πάντων· καὶ ἐπιθήσει χλοῖον σιδη-
ροῦν ἐπὶ τὸν τράχηλόν σου, ἕως ἂν ἐξολοθρεύσῃ σε.
49 Ἐπάξει Κύ-
ριος ἐπὶ σὲ ἔθνος μακρόθεν ἀπ’ ἐσχάτου τῆς γῆς, ὡσεὶ ἔρπημα
ἀετοῦ, ἔθνος οὗ οὐκ ἀκούσῃ τῆς φωνῆς αὐτοῦ,
50 ἔθνος ἀναιδὲς προ-
σώπῳ, ὅστις οὐ θαυμάσει πρόσωπον πρεσβυτέρου, καὶ νέον οὐκ
ἐλεήσει·
51 καὶ κατέδεται τὰ ἔκγονα τῶν κτηνῶν σου, καὶ τὰ γεννή-
ματα τῆς γῆς σου, ἕως ἐκτρίψῃ σε, ὥστε μὴ καταλιπεῖν σοι
σῖτον, οἶνον καὶ ἔλαιον, βουκόλια τῶν βοῶν σου καὶ τὰ ποί-
μνια τῶν προβάτων σου, ἕως ἂν ἀπολέσῃ σε.
52 Καὶ ἐκτρίψει σε ἐν
πάσαις ταῖς πόλεσί σου, ἕως ἂν καθαιρεθῶσι τὰ τείχη σου τὰ ὑψηλὰ
καὶ τὰ ὀχυρά, ἐφ’ οἷς σὺ πέποιθας ἐπ’ αὐτοῖς, ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ
σου· καὶ θλίψει σε ἐν πάσαις ταῖς πόλεσί σου, ἐν πάσῃ γῇ σου,
ἧς ἔδωκέ σοι Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου.
53 Καὶ φαγῇ τὰ ἔκγονα τῆς κοιλι-
ας σου, κρέα υἱῶν σου καὶ θυγατέρων σου ὅσα ἔδωκέ σοι Κύριος
ὁ Θεός σου, ἐν τῇ στενοχωρίᾳ σου καὶ ἐν τῇ θλίψει σου, ᾗ θλί-
ψει σε ὁ ἐχθρός σου.
54 Ὁ ἀνὴρ ὁ ἁπαλὸς ἐν σοὶ καὶ ὁ τρυφερὸς
σφόδρα, βασκανεῖ τῷ ὀφθαλμῷ αὐτοῦ τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὴν
γυναῖκα (αὐτοῦ) τὴν ἐν τῷ κόλπῳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ καταλελειμμένα τὰ
τέκνα αὐτοῦ, ἃ ἂν καταλειφθῇ αὐτῷ,
55 ὥστε δοῦναι ἑνὶ αὐτῶν ἀπὸ
τῶν σαρκῶν τῶν τέκνων αὐτοῦ, ὧν ἂν κατέσθῃ, διὰ τὸ μὴ κατα-
λελείφθαι αὐτῷ μηθὲν ἐν τῇ στενοχωρίᾳ καὶ ἐν τῇ θλίψει σου,
ᾗ ἂν θλίψει σε ὁ ἐχθρός σου ἐν πάσαις ταῖς πόλεσί σου·
56 καὶ ἡ ἀπαλὴ

41 And thy sons and thy daughters shalt thou beget, but they shall not be thine; for they shall go forth into captivity.
42 All thy trees, and the produce of thy land, shall the rust consume.
43 The sojourner that is within thee shall ascend upon thee higher and higher; but thou shalt descend lower and lower.
44 He shall lend unto thee, but thou shalt not lend unto him; he shall be for a head, and thou shalt be for a tail.
45 And all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue thee, and shall overtake thee, until they shall utterly destroy thee, and until they shall cause thee to perish.
46 For that thou didst not hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God, [to give heed to] (thee, all) His commandments and His ordinances, even all that He commanded thee.
47 And it shall be upon thee [for] signs and wonders, and upon thy seed forever; because thou didst not serve the Lord thy God with gladness and with a good heart by reason of the abundance of all things.
48 And thou shalt serve thine enemies, whom the Lord shall send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in the lack of all things; and He shall put an iron collar upon thy neck, until He shall utterly destroy thee.
49 The Lord shall bring upon thee a nation from afar, from the uttermost end of the earth, as the crawling spread of an eagle, a nation whose voice thou shalt not understand,
50 a nation shameless of countenance, which shall not regard the face of an elder, nor pity the young;
51 and it shall devour the offspring of thy cattle, and the produce of thy land, until it shall utterly destroy thee, so that it shall not leave thee grain, wine, nor oil, [nor] the herds of thy oxen and the flocks of thy sheep, until it shall cause thee to perish.
52 And it shall crush thee in all thy cities, until thy high and strong walls be cast down, wherein thou didst put thy trust, [even] in all thy land; and it shall oppress thee in all thy cities, in all thy land, which the Lord thy God hath given thee.
53 And thou shalt eat the fruit of thy belly, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters, which the Lord thy God hath given thee, in thy straitness and in thy tribulation, wherewith thine enemy shall afflict thee.
54 The man that is tender among thee, and exceedingly delicate, his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward his wife (of him) that lieth in his bosom, and his children that are left, which shall be left unto him,
55 so that he shall give to one of them of the flesh of his children, which he shall eat, because nothing is left unto him in thy straitness and in thy tribulation, wherewith thine enemy shall afflict thee in all thy cities.
56 And the woman that is tender
