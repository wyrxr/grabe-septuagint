ΛΕΥΙΤΙΚΟΝ.

ΚΕΦΑΛΑΙΟΝ Α΄. Ι.

1   ΚΑΙ ἀνεκάλεσε Μωυσῆν, καὶ ἐλάλησε Κύριος αὐτῷ ἐκ τῆς
2   σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου, λέγων· λάλησον τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ
    ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτούς· ἄνθρωπος ἐξ ὑμῶν ἐὰν προσφέρῃ δῶρα τῷ
    Κυρίῳ, ἀπὸ τῶν κτηνῶν, ἀπὸ τῶν βοῶν, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν προβάτων
3   προσόισετε τὰ δῶρα ὑμῶν. Ἐὰν ὁλοκαύτωμα τὸ δῶρον αὐτοῦ ἐκ
    τῶν βοῶν, ἄρσεν ἄμωμον προσάξει· πρὸς τὴν θύραν τῆς σκηνῆς
4   τοῦ μαρτυρίου προσόισει αὐτὸ δεκτὸν αὐτῷ ἔναντι Κυρίου· καὶ ἐπι-
    θήσει τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν τοῦ καρπώματος, δεκτὸν
5   αὐτῷ, ἐξιλάσασθαι περὶ αὐτοῦ· καὶ σφάξουσι τὸν μόσχον ἔναντι
    Κυρίου· καὶ προσόισουσιν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἀαρὼν οἱ ἱερεῖς τὸ αἷμα, καὶ
    προχεοῦσι τὸ αἷμα ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον κύκλῳ, τὸ ἐπὶ τῶν θυρῶν
6   τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου· καὶ δείραντες τὸ ὁλοκαύτωμα, μελιοῦ-
7   σιν αὐτὸ κατὰ μέλη αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐπιθήσουσιν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἀαρὼν οἱ ἱε-
    ρεῖς πῦρ ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον, καὶ στοιβάσουσι ξύλα ἐπὶ τὸ πῦρ·
8   καὶ ἐπιστοιβάσουσιν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἀαρὼν οἱ ἱερεῖς (ἐπὶ) τὰ διχοτομή-
    ματα, καὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν, καὶ τὸ στέαρ, ἐπὶ τὰ ξύλα τὰ ἐπὶ τοῦ
9   πυρός, τὰ ὄντα ἐπὶ τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου. τὰ δὲ ἐγκοίλια αὐτοῦ καὶ
    τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ λυνοῦσιν ὕδατι· καὶ ἐπιθήσει ὁ ἱερεὺς τὰ πάν-
    τα ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον· κάρπωμά ἐστι θυσία ὀσμὴ εὐωδίας τῷ
10  Κυρίῳ. Ἐὰν δὲ ἀπὸ τῶν προβάτων τὸ δῶρον αὐτοῦ τῷ Κυρίῳ,
    ἀπό τε τῶν ἀρνῶν καὶ τῶν ἐρίφων εἰς ὁλοκαύτωμα, ἄρσεν ἄμω-
11  μον προσάξει αὐτὸ, καὶ ἐπιθήσει τὴν χεῖρα ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐ-
    τοῦ· καὶ σφάξουσιν αὐτὸ ἐκ πλαγίων τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου πρὸς βορ-
12  ρᾶν ἔναντι Κυρίου· καὶ προσχεοῦσιν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἀαρὼν οἱ ἱερεῖς τὸ
    αἷμα αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον κύκλῳ· καὶ διελοῦσιν αὐτὸ κατὰ
    μέλη αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὸ στέαρ αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐ-
    πιστοιβάσουσιν αὐτὰ οἱ ἱερεῖς ἐπὶ τὰ ξύλα τὰ ἐπὶ τοῦ πυρός, τὰ

**LEVITICUS.**

**CHAPTER I.**

1   And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the
2   tabernacle of the testimony, saying: Speak unto the children of Israel, and
    say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto the Lord,
    ye shall bring your offering of the livestock, [even] of the oxen, and of the sheep.
3   If his offering be a burnt offering of the herd,
    a male without blemish shall he bring: unto the door of the tabernacle
4   of the testimony shall he bring it, that it may be accepted for him before the Lord. And he shall lay
    his hand upon the head of the burnt offering, [that it may be] accepted
5   for him, to make atonement for him. And they shall slaughter the bullock before
    the Lord: and the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall bring the blood, and
    shall pour out the blood upon the altar round about, which is at the doors
6   of the tabernacle of the testimony. And having flayed the burnt offering, they shall cut
7   it into its pieces. And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall put
    fire upon the altar, and shall lay wood upon the fire.
8   And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall pile [upon] the divided
    pieces, and the head, and the fat, upon the wood that is upon the
9   fire, [even] that which is upon the altar. But its inwards and
    its feet shall they loosen with water. And the priest shall lay all
    upon the altar; it is a burnt offering, a sacrifice, a savour of a sweet smell unto
10  the Lord. And if his offering unto the Lord be of the flocks,
    both of the lambs and of the goats for a burnt offering, a male without
11  blemish shall he bring it, and he shall lay his hand upon its head.
    And they shall slaughter it on the side of the altar toward the
12  north before the Lord. And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall pour
    its blood upon the altar round about. And they shall cut it into its
    pieces, and its head, and its fat. And the
    priests shall pile them upon the wood that is upon the fire, the
