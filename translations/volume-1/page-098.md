ΚΕΦ. ΜΔ΄. ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ
εὗρε τὴν ἀδικίαν τῶν παίδων σου· ἰδοὺ ἔσμεν οἰκέται τῷ κυρίῳ ἡμῶν, καὶ ἡμεῖς, καὶ παρ᾿ ᾧ εὑρέθη τὸ κόνδυ.
17 Εἶπε δὲ Ἰωσήφ· μή μοι γένοιτο ποιῆσαι τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο· ὁ ἄνθρωπος παρ᾿ ᾧ εὑρέθη τὸ κόνδυ, αὐτὸς ἔσται μου παῖς· ὑμεῖς δὲ ἀνάβητε μετὰ σωτηρίας πρὸς τὸν πατέρα ὑμῶν.
18 Ἐγγίσας δὲ αὐτῷ Ἰούδας, εἶπε· δέομαι κύριε, λαλησάτω ὁ παῖς σου ῥῆμα ἐναντίον σου, καὶ μὴ θυμωθῇς τῷ παιδί σου, ὅτι σὺ εἶ μετὰ Φαραώ.
19 Κύριε, σὺ ἠρώτησας τοὺς παῖδάς σου, λέγων· εἰ ἔχετε πατέρα ἢ ἀδελφόν;
20 Καὶ εἴπαμεν τῷ κυρίῳ· ἔστιν ἡμῖν πατὴρ πρεσβύτερος, καὶ παιδίον νεώτερον γήρως αὐτῷ, καὶ ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ ἀπέθανεν, αὐτὸς δὲ μόνος ὑπελείφθη τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ· ὁ δὲ πατὴρ αὐτὸν ἠγάπησεν.
21 Εἶπας δὲ τοῖς παισί σου· (ὅτι) καταγάγετε αὐτὸν πρός με, καὶ ἐπιμελοῦμαι αὐτοῦ.
22 Καὶ εἴπαμεν τῷ κυρίῳ μου· οὐ δυνήσεται τὸ παιδίον καταλιπεῖν τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ· ἐὰν δὲ καταλίπῃ τὸν πατέρα, ἀποθανεῖται.
23 Σὺ δὲ εἴπας τοῖς παισί σου· ἐὰν μὴ καταβῇ ὁ ἀδελφὸς ὑμῶν ὁ νεώτερος μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν, οὐ προσθήσεσθε ἔτι ἰδεῖν τὸ πρόσωπόν μου.
24 Ἐγένετο δὲ ἡνίκα ἀνέβημεν πρὸς τὸν παῖδά σου, πατέρα δὲ ἡμῶν, ἀπηγγείλαμεν αὐτῷ τὰ ῥήματα τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν.
25 Εἶπε δὲ ἡμῖν ὁ πατὴρ ἡμῶν· βαδίσατε πάλιν, ἀγοράσατε ἡμῖν μικρὰ βρώματα.
26 Ἡμεῖς δὲ εἴπαμεν· οὐ δυνησόμεθα καταβῆναι, ἀλλ᾿ εἰ μὲν ὁ ἀδελφὸς ἡμῶν ὁ νεώτερος καταβαίνει μεθ᾿ ἡμῶν, καταβησόμεθα· οὐ γὰρ δυνησόμεθα ἰδεῖν τὸ πρόσωπον τοῦ ἀνθρώπου, τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ ἡμῶν τοῦ νεωτέρου μὴ ὄντος μεθ᾿ ἡμῶν.
27 Εἶπε δὲ ὁ παῖς σου ὁ πατὴρ ἡμῶν πρὸς ἡμᾶς· ὑμεῖς γινώσκετε ὅτι δύο ἔτεκέ μοι ἡ γυνή μου·
28 καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ὁ εἷς ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ, καὶ εἴπατε· θηριόβρωτος γέγονε, καὶ οὐκ ἴδον αὐτὸν ἔτι νῦν.
29 Ἐὰν οὖν λάβητε καὶ τοῦτον ἐκ προσώπου μου, καὶ συμβῇ αὐτῷ μαλακία ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ, καὶ κατάξετέ μου τὸ γῆρας μετὰ λύπης εἰς ᾅδου.
30 Νῦν οὖν εἰσπορευώμαι πρὸς τὸν παῖδά σου, πατέρα δὲ ἡμῶν, καὶ τὸ παιδάριον μὴ ᾖ μεθ᾿ ἡμῶν, (ἡ δὲ ψυχὴ αὐτοῦ ἐκκρέμαται ἐκ τῆς τούτου ψυχῆς,)
31 καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῷ ἰδεῖν αὐτὸν μὴ ὄν τὸ παιδάριον μεθ᾿ ἡμῶν, τελευτήσει, καὶ κατάξουσιν οἱ παῖδές σου τὸ γῆρας τοῦ παιδός σου, πατρὸς δὲ ἡμῶν, μετ᾿ ὀδύνης εἰς ᾅδου.
32 Ὁ γὰρ παῖς σου ἐκδέδεκται τὸ παιδίον παρὰ τοῦ πατρός, λέγων· ἐὰν μὴ ἀγάγω αὐτὸν πρός σε, καὶ στήσω αὐτὸν ἐναντίον σου, ἡμαρτηκὼς ἔσομαι πρὸς τὸν πατέρα πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας.
33 Νῦν οὖν παραμενῶ σοι παῖς ἀντὶ τοῦ παιδίου, οἰκέτης τοῦ κυρίου μου·
34 τὸ δὲ παιδίον ἀναβήτω μετὰ τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτοῦ. Πῶς γὰρ ἀναβήσομαι πρὸς τὸν πατέρα, τοῦ παιδίου μὴ ὄντος μεθ᾿ ἡμῶν; ἵνα μὴ ἴδω τὰ κακά, ἃ εὑρήσει τὸν πατέρα μου.

...hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are servants to my lord, both we, and he with whom the cup was found.
**17** And Joseph said, "Far be it from me to do this thing; the man with whom the cup was found, he himself shall be my servant; but as for you, get you up in peace unto your father."

**18** Then Judah drew nigh unto him, and said, "Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in thine ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant; for thou art even as Pharaoh.
**19** My lord, thou didst ask thy servants, saying, 'Have ye a father or a brother?'
**20** And we said unto my lord, 'We have a father, an old man, and a young child, a child of his old age; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.'
**21** And thou saidst unto thy servants, '(That ye) bring him down unto me, and I will care for him.'
**22** And we said unto my lord, 'The child cannot leave his father; for if he should leave his father, then would [the father] die.'
**23** And thou saidst unto thy servants, 'Unless your younger brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.'
**24** And it came to pass, when we went up unto thy servant, even our father, we told him the words of our lord.
**25** And our father said unto us, 'Go again, and buy us a little food.'
**26** But we said, 'We cannot go down; but if our younger brother go down with us, then will we go down: for we cannot see the face of the man, unless our younger brother be with us.'
**27** Then thy servant our father said unto us, 'Ye know that my wife bare me two sons;
**28** and the one went forth from me, and ye said, "He hath surely been torn by a beast;" and I have not seen him until now.
**29** If therefore ye take this one also from my presence, and sickness befall him by the way, then shall ye bring down my grey hairs with sorrow to Hades.
**30** Now therefore, if I come unto thy servant, even our father, and the lad be not with us, (for his soul is bound up with the soul of this one,)
**31** and it shall be, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die; and thy servants shall bring down the grey hairs of thy servant, our father, with pain to Hades.
**32** For thy servant became surety for the lad unto his father, saying, 'If I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then shall I be guilty before my father all my days.'
**33** Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad, a bondman to my lord;
**34** and let the lad go up with his brethren. For how shall I go up unto my father, if the lad be not with us, lest I see the evil that shall befall my father?"
