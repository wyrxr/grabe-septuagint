ΚΕΦ. Θʹ.
**5.** ἐπορεύθησαν ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ εἰς Ἐφρὰ, καὶ ἀπέκτεινε τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ, υἱοὺς Ἰεροβάαλ, ἑβδομήκοντα ἄνδρας, ἐπὶ λίθον ἕνα· καὶ ἀπελείφθη Ἰωάθαμ, υἱὸς Ἰεροβάαλ ὁ νεώτερος, ὅτι ἐκρύβη.
**6.** Καὶ συνήχθησαν πάντες οἱ ἄνδρες Σικίμων καὶ πᾶς ὁ οἶκος Μααλλὼν, καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν, καὶ ἐβασίλευσαν τὸν Ἀβιμέλεχ εἰς βασιλέα πρὸς τῇ βαλάνῳ τῆς στάσεως ἐν Σικίμοις.
**7.** Καὶ ἀνήγγειλαν τῷ Ἰωάθαμ, καὶ ἐπορεύθη, καὶ ἔστη ἐπὶ τῆς κορυφῆς τοῦ ὄρους Γαριζεὶν καὶ ἐπῆρε τὴν φωνὴν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐκάλεσεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς·
"ἀκούσατέ μου ἄνδρες Σικίμων, καὶ ἀκούσαι ὑμῶν ὁ Θεός.
**8.** Πορευόμενα ἐπορεύθησαν τὰ ξύλα, τοῦ χρῖσαι ἑαυτοῖς βασιλέα,
**9.** καὶ εἶπαν τῇ ἐλαίᾳ· βασίλευσον ἐφ᾿ ἡμῶν. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς ἡ ἐλαία· ἀφεῖσα τὴν πιότητά μου, ἣν ἐν ἐμοὶ ἐδόξασεν ὁ Θεὸς καὶ ἄνθρωποι, πορευθῶ ἄρχειν τῶν ξύλων;
**10.** Καὶ εἶπαν τὰ ξύλα τῇ συκῇ· δεῦρο, βασίλευσον ἐφ᾿ ἡμῶν.
**11.** Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς ἡ συκῆ· ἀφεῖσα τὴν γλυκύτητά μου καὶ τὸ ἀγαθὸν γέννημά μου, καὶ πορευθῶ ἄρχειν ξύλων;
**12.** Καὶ εἶπαν τὰ ξύλα τῇ ἀμπέλῳ· δεῦρο, βασίλευσον ἐφ᾿ ἡμῶν.
**13.** Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς ἡ ἄμπελος· ἀφεῖσα τὸν οἶνόν μου, τὴν εὐφροσύνην (τὴν παρὰ) τοῦ Θεοῦ καὶ τῶν ἀνθρώπων, πορευθῶ ἄρχειν ξύλων;
**14.** Καὶ εἶπαν τὰ ξύλα πρὸς τὴν ῥάμνον· δεῦρο σὺ, βασίλευσον ἐφ᾿ ἡμῶν.
**15.** Καὶ εἶπεν ἡ ῥάμνος πρὸς τὰ ξύλα· εἰ ἐν ἀληθείᾳ ὑμεῖς χρίετέ με εἰς βασιλέα ἐφ᾿ ὑμῶν, δεῦτε, πεποίθατε ἐν τῇ σκέπῃ μου· καὶ εἰ μὴ, ἐξέλθοι πῦρ ἐκ τῆς ῥάμνου, καὶ καταφάγοι τὰς κέδρους τοῦ Λιβάνου.
**16.** Καὶ νῦν εἰ ἐν ἀληθείᾳ καὶ ἐν τελειότητι ἐποιήσατε, καὶ ἐβασιλεύσατε τὸν Ἀβιμέλεχ, καὶ εἰ καλῶς ἐποιήσατε μετὰ Ἰεροβάαλ, καὶ μετὰ τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἰ κατὰ τὸ ἀνταπόδομα τῆς χειρὸς αὐτοῦ ἐποιήσατε αὐτῷ,
**17.** ὡς ἐπολέμησεν ὁ πατήρ μου ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐξῆψε τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ ἐξεναντίας, καὶ ἐξείλατο ὑμᾶς ἐκ χειρὸς Μαδιὰμ,
**18.** καὶ ὑμεῖς ἐπανέστητε ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον τοῦ πατρὸς μου σήμερον, καὶ ἀπεκτείνατε τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ, ἑβδομήκοντα ἄνδρας, ἐπὶ λίθον ἕνα, καὶ ἐβασιλεύσατε τὸν Ἀβιμέλεχ υἱὸν τῆς παιδίσκης αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τοὺς ἄνδρας Σικίμων, ὅτι ἀδελφὸς ὑμῶν ἐστι·
**19.** καὶ εἰ ἐν ἀληθείᾳ καὶ τελειότητι ἐποιήσατε μετὰ Ἰεροβάαλ καὶ τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ταύτῃ, εὐλογηθεῖτε ὑμεῖς, καὶ εὐφρανθείητε ἐν Ἀβιμέλεχ,
**20.** καὶ εὐφρανθείη καίγε αὐτὸς ἐν ὑμῖν. Καὶ εἰ μὴ, ἐξέλθοι πῦρ ἐξ Ἀβιμέλεχ, καὶ καταφάγοι τοὺς ἄνδρας Σικίμων,

**CHAPTER 9.**

**5.** and they followed after him. And he came unto the house of his father in Ophrah, and slew his brethren, the seventy sons of Jerubbaal, upon one stone; but Jotham, the youngest son of Jerubbaal, was left, for he had hid himself.
**6.** And all the men of Shechem gathered themselves together, and all the house of Millo, and went and made Abimelech king, by the oak of the pillar in Shechem.

**7.** And they told it unto Jotham; and he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried aloud, and said unto them:
"Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, and may God hearken unto you!
**8.** The trees once went forth, to anoint a king over themselves;
**9.** And they said unto the olive tree, 'Reign thou over us.' And the olive tree said unto them, 'Shall I leave my fatness, which God and men have honored in me, and go forth to rule over the trees?'
**10.** Then the trees said unto the fig tree, 'Come thou, reign thou over us.'
**11.** And the fig tree said unto them, 'Shall I leave my sweetness and my good fruit, and go forth to rule over the trees?'
**12.** Then the trees said unto the vine, 'Come thou, reign thou over us.'
**13.** And the vine said unto them, 'Shall I leave my wine, which maketh glad [both] God and men, and go forth to rule over the trees?'
**14.** Then all the trees said unto the bramble, 'Come thou, reign thou over us.'
**15.** And the bramble said unto the trees, 'If in truth ye anoint me king over you, then come and trust in my shadow; but if not, let fire come forth from the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.'

**16.** Now therefore, if ye have dealt truly and with integrity, in that ye have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and with his house, and if ye have rendered unto him according to the recompense of his hand—
**17.** for my father fought for you, and put his life in jeopardy, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian—
**18.** Yet ye have risen up against the house of my father this day, and have slain his sons, seventy men, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother.
**19.** If then ye have dealt truly and with integrity with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then be ye blessed, and rejoice ye in Abimelech,
**20.** and may he also rejoice in you. But if not, let fire come forth from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem,"
