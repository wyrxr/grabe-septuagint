**Chapter X**

22 And they shall pitch the tabernacle until they arrive [at their destination]. And the standard of the camp of Ephraim shall set forward with their hosts; and over their host
23 was Elishama, the son of Ammihud. And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh, [was] Gamaliel, the son of Pedahzur.
24 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin, [was] Abidan, the son of Gideoni.
25 And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan shall set forward, which was the rearward of all the camps, with their hosts;
26 and over their host, [was] Ahiezer, the son of Ammishaddai. And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher, [was] Pagiel, the son of Ocran.
27 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali, [was] Ahira, the son of Enan.
28 These were the divisions of the children of Israel, even as they set forth with their hosts.

29 And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite, Moses’ brother-in-law, "We are journeying unto the place of which the LORD said, 'I will give it you.' Come thou with us, and we will do thee good, for the LORD hath spoken good concerning Israel."
30 And he said unto him, "I will not go, but I will depart unto mine own land, and to my kindred."
31 And he said, "Leave us not, I pray thee, forasmuch as thou hast been with us in the wilderness, and thou shalt be an elder among us."
32 "And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be that whatsoever good thing the LORD shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee."

33 And they departed from the mount of the LORD, a journey of three days; and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them a journey of three days, to search out for them a resting place.
35 And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, "Rise up, O LORD, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let all those that hate Thee flee before Thy face!"
36 And when it rested, he said, "Return, O LORD, unto the thousands of the ten thousands in Israel!"
34 And the cloud was a shadowing over them by day, when they set forth from the camp.

**Chapter XI**

1 And the people were as it were murmuring of evil before the LORD; and the LORD heard it; and His anger was kindled, and fire from the LORD burnt among them, and consumed a part of the camp.
2 And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the LORD, the fire was quenched.
3 And the name of that place was called Burning: because fire from the LORD burnt among them.
