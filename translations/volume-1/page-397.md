           αὐτοὺς τὴν γῆν, ἣν ὤμοσε Κύριος τοῖς πατράσιν αὐτῶν,

**Joshua 5**

1 And no spirit was left within them, by reason of the sons of Israel.

2 Now at that time the Lord spake unto Joshua, saying, "Make thee knives of sharp stone, and circumcise anew the children of Israel."

3 And Joshua made him knives of sharp stone; and he circumcised the children of Israel at the place [which is] called the Hill of the Foreskins.

4 Now this is the manner by which Joshua purified the children of Israel: all those who were born on the journey, and all those who were uncircumcised among them that came out of Egypt—all these did Joshua circumcise. Now the whole people who came out of Egypt, the males, all the men of war, died in the wilderness on the journey, when they had gone forth from the land of Egypt;

5 for all the people that came out were circumcised; yet all the people that were born in the wilderness on the journey, after they came forth from the land of Egypt, were not circumcised.

6 For forty and two years had Israel wandered in the wilderness of Mabdaris; wherefore the greater part of those men of war who came forth from the land of Egypt, who had disobeyed the commandments of God, remained uncircumcised. To them also did the Lord ordain that they should not see the land, which the Lord sware unto their fathers, to give unto us, a land flowing with milk and honey.

7 But in their stead, He raised up their sons, whom Joshua circumcised, for they were uncircumcised, because they had been born uncircumcised during the journey.

8 And when all the nation were circumcised, they rested; abiding there in the camp until they were healed.

9 And the Lord said unto Joshua, "This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you." And he called the name of that place Gilgal unto this day.

10 And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and the children of Israel kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month, at eventide, in the plain to the west of Jericho.

11 And they did eat of the produce of the land on the morrow after the Passover, unleavened bread and new produce.

12 And on that same day the manna ceased, on the morrow, after they had eaten of the produce of the land; neither was there manna any longer for the children of Israel. But they did reap the harvest of the land of palms in that year.

13 And it came to pass, when Joshua was in Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and saw, and behold, a man stood over against him, and his sword was drawn.
