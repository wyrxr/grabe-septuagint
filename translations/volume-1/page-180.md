καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰς κιδάρεις ἐκ βύσσου, καὶ τὴν μίτραν ἐκ βύσσου, καὶ τὰ περισκελῆ ἐκ βύσσου κεχλωμένας, καὶ τὰς ζώνας αὐτῶν ἐκ βύσσου, καὶ ὑακίνθου, καὶ πορφύρας, καὶ κοκκίνου νενησμένος, ἔργον ποικιλτοῦ, ὃν τρόπον συνέταξε Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ. Καὶ ἐποίησαν τὸ πέταλον τὸ χρυσοῦν, ἀφόρισμα τοῦ ἁγίου, χρυσίου καθαροῦ· καὶ ἔγραψαν ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῦ τὰ γράμματα ἐντετυπωμένα σφραγῖδος, ἁγίασμα Κυρίῳ· καὶ ἐπέθηκαν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸ λάμμα ὑακίνθινον, ὥστε ἐπιείσθαι ἐπὶ τὴν μίτραν ἄνωθεν, ὃν τρόπον συνέταξε Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ.

ΚΕΦ. ΛΖʹ. XXXVII.

ΚΑῚ ἐποίησαν τῇ σκηνῇ δέκα αὑλαίας· ὀκτὼ καὶ εἴκοσι πηχῶν μῆκος τῆς αὑλαίας τῆς μιᾶς, (τὸ αὐτὸ ἦσαν πᾶσαι) καὶ τεσσάρων πήχεων τὸ εὖρος τῆς αὑλαίας τῆς μιᾶς. Καὶ ἐποίησαν τὸ καταπέτασμα ἐξ ὑακίνθου, καὶ πορφύρας, καὶ κοκκίνου νενησμένου, καὶ βύσσου κεχλωμένης, ἔργον ὑφαντὸν Χερουβείμ· καὶ ἐπέθηκαν αὐτὸ ἐπὶ τέσσαρας στύλους ἀσήπτους, κατακεχρυσωμένους χρυσίῳ· καὶ αἱ κεφαλίδες αὐτῶν χρυσαῖ, καὶ αἱ βάσεις αὐτῶν τέσσαρες ἀργυραῖ. Καὶ ἐποίησαν τὸ καταπέτασμα τῆς θύρας τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου ἐξ ὑακίνθου, καὶ πορφύρας, καὶ κοκκίνου νενησμένου, καὶ βύσσου κεχλωμένης, ἔργον ὑφαντὸν Χερουβείμ, (καὶ τοὺς Χερουβείμ,) καὶ τοὺς στύλους αὐτοῦ πέντε, καὶ τοὺς κρίκους αὐτῶν· καὶ τὰς κεφαλὰς αὐτῶν καὶ τὰς ψαλίδας αὐτῶν κατεχρύσωσαν χρυσίῳ, καὶ τὰς βάσεις αὐτῶν πέντε χαλκᾶς. Καὶ ἐποίησαν τὴν αὐλὴν τὰ πρὸς λίβα, ἱστία τῆς αὐλῆς ἐκ βύσσου κεχλωμένης ἑκατὸν ἐφ᾿ ἑκατόν· καὶ οἱ στύλοι αὐτῶν εἴκοσι, καὶ αἱ βάσεις αὐτῶν εἴκοσι χαλκαῖ. Καὶ τὸ κλίτος τὸ πρὸς βορρᾶν ἑκατὸν ἐφ᾿ ἑκατόν· καὶ οἱ στύλοι αὐτῶν εἴκοσι, καὶ αἱ βάσεις αὐτῶν εἴκοσι χαλκαῖ. Καὶ τὸ κλίτος τὸ κατὰ θάλασσαν αὐλαῖαι πεντήκοντα· στύλοι αὐτῶν δέκα, καὶ βάσεις αὐτῶν δέκα. Καὶ τὸ κλίτος τὸ πρὸς ἀνατολὰς πεντήκοντα πήχεων, ἱστία πεντεκαίδεκα πήχεων τὰ κατὰ νότου· καὶ οἱ στύλοι αὐτῶν τρεῖς, καὶ αἱ βάσεις αὐτῶν τρεῖς. Καὶ ἐπὶ τοῦ νότου τοῦ δευτέρου ἔνθεν καὶ ἔνθεν κατὰ τὴν πύλην τῆς αὐλῆς, αὐλαῖαι πεντεκαίδεκα πήχεων· καὶ οἱ στύλοι αὐτῶν τρεῖς, καὶ αἱ βάσεις αὐτῶν τρεῖς.

**Chapter 36**

And unto his sons, they did make the turbans of fine linen, and the miter of fine linen, and the breeches of fine linen, [being] bleached; and their sashes of fine linen, and of hyacinth, and of purple, and of scarlet, [being] spun, the work of an embroiderer; even as the Lord commanded Moses.

And they did make the plate of gold, a consecrated thing unto the holy [place], of pure gold; and they did engrave upon it the letters, wrought as the engraving of a signet, [saying], "Holiness unto the Lord." And they did set upon it a lace of hyacinth, that it might be put upon the miter above, even as the Lord commanded Moses.

**Chapter 37**

And they made for the Tabernacle ten curtains. The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits (and they were all of the same [measure]), and the breadth of one curtain was four cubits.

And they made the veil of hyacinth, and of purple, and of spun scarlet, and of fine-spun linen, a work of woven Cherubim. And they placed it upon four pillars of imperishable wood, overlaid with gold; and their capitals were of gold, and their four bases were of silver.

And they made the curtain for the door of the Tabernacle of Testimony, of hyacinth, and of purple, and of spun scarlet, and of fine-spun linen, a work of woven Cherubim, (and the Cherubim), and its five pillars, and their rings. And they overlaid their heads and their hooks with gold, and their five bases were of bronze.

And they made the court on the side toward the south, hangings for the court of fine-spun linen, an hundred [cubits] for an hundred [cubits]. And their pillars were twenty, and their bases were twenty of bronze.

And the side toward the north, an hundred [cubits] for an hundred [cubits]. And their pillars were twenty, and their bases were twenty of bronze.

And the side toward the west, curtains fifty [cubits in length]; their pillars ten, and their bases ten.

And the side toward the east, fifty cubits [in length], hangings of fifteen cubits on the south [part]; and their pillars three, and their bases three. And on the second south [part], on this side and on that side, by the gate of the court, curtains of fifteen cubits; and their pillars three, and their bases three.
