CHAPTER XXIX. EXODUS

15 one, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram.
16 And thou shalt slay the ram; and taking the blood, thou shalt pour it round about upon the altar.
17 And the ram shalt thou cut into pieces according to its parts; and thou shalt wash its inwards and its feet with water; and thou shalt lay them upon the pieces, with its head.
18 And thou shalt offer the whole ram upon the altar, a burnt offering unto the Lord for a savor of sweet smell; it is a sacrifice unto the Lord.
19 And thou shalt take the second ram; and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram.
20 And thou shalt slay it; and thou shalt take of its blood, and put it upon the lobe of Aaron’s right ear, and upon the tip of his right hand, and upon the tip of his right foot; and upon the lobes of the right ears of his sons, and upon the tips of their right hands, and upon the tips of their right feet.
21 And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar, and of the oil of anointing, and shalt sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garment, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him; and he shall be hallowed, and his garment, and his sons, and the garments of his sons with him; but the blood of the ram shalt thou pour round about upon the altar.
22 And thou shalt take from the ram its fat, and the fat that covereth the belly, and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right shoulder;
23 (for this is the ram of consecration;) and one loaf of bread made with oil, and one unleavened cake from the basket of unleavened bread, which are laid before the Lord;
24 and thou shalt place all these upon the hands of Aaron, and upon the hands of his sons; and thou shalt wave them for a wave offering before the Lord.
25 And thou shalt take them from their hands, and offer them up upon the altar for a burnt offering, for a savor of sweet smell before the Lord; it is an offering to the Lord.
26 And thou shalt take the breast from the ram of consecration, which is Aaron’s [portion], and shalt wave it for a wave offering before the Lord; and it shall be unto thee for a portion.
27 And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the shoulder of the heave offering, which hath been waved and which hath been taken from the ram of consecration, from Aaron and from his sons;
28 and it shall be unto Aaron and unto his sons a perpetual statute from the children of Israel.
