**2.** ἀπὸ προσώπου Μαδιάμ· μάνδρας ἐν τοῖς ὄρεσι καὶ τοῖς σπηλαίοις καὶ τοῖς ὀχυρώμασι.
**3.** Καὶ ἐγένετο ὅταν ἔσπειρεν ἀνὴρ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἀνέβαινε Μαδιὰμ καὶ Ἀμαλὴκ καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ ἀνατολῶν, καὶ ἀνέβαινον ἐπ᾿ αὐτόν.
**4.** Καὶ παρενέβαλλον ἐπ᾿ αὐτούς, καὶ διέφθειραν τὰ ἐκφόρια τῆς γῆς, ἕως τοῦ ἐλθεῖν εἰς Γάζαν· καὶ οὐχ ὑπελείποντο ὑπόστασιν ζωῆς ἐν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ποίμνιον, καὶ μόσχον, καὶ ὄνον.
**5.** Ὅτι αὐτοὶ καὶ τὰ κτήνη αὐτῶν ἀνέβαινον, καὶ τὰς σκηνὰς αὐτῶν παρέφερον, καὶ παρεγείνοντο, ὡς ἄκρις εἰς πλῆθος, καὶ αὐτοῖς καὶ ταῖς καμήλοις αὐτῶν οὐχ ἦν ἀριθμός· καὶ παρεγείνοντο ἐν τῇ γῇ Ἰσραήλ, τοῦ διαφθεῖρεν αὐτήν.
**6.** Καὶ ἐπτωχεύσεν Ἰσραὴλ σφόδρα ἀπὸ προσώπου Μαδιάμ· καὶ ἐκέκραξαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς Κύριον.
**7.** Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐπεὶ ἐκέκραξαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς Κύριον περὶ Μαδιάμ,
**8.** καὶ ἐξαπέστειλε Κύριος ἄνδρα προφήτην πρὸς τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ· ἐγὼ εἰμι ὁ ἀναβιβάσας ὑμᾶς ἐξ Αἰγύπτου,
**9.** καὶ ἐξήγαγον ὑμᾶς ἐξ οἴκου δουλείας· καὶ ἐξειλόμην ὑμᾶς ἐκ χειρὸς Αἰγύπτου, καὶ ἐκ χειρὸς πάντων τῶν θλιβόντων ὑμᾶς· καὶ ἐξέβαλον αὐτοὺς ἐκ προσώπου ὑμῶν, καὶ ἔδωκα ὑμῖν τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν.
**10.** Καὶ εἶπα ὑμῖν· ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν, οὐ φοβηθήσεσθε τοὺς θεοὺς τοῦ Ἀμοῤῥαίου, ἐν οἷς ὑμεῖς ἐνοικεῖτε ἐν τῇ γῇ αὐτῶν· καὶ οὐκ εἰσηκούσατε τῆς φωνῆς μου.
**11.** Καὶ ἦλθεν ἄγγελος Κυρίου, καὶ ἐκάθισεν ὑπὸ τὴν δρῦν τὴν οὖσαν ἐν Ἐφρά, τὴν τοῦ Ἰωὰς πατρὸς Ἰεζρί· καὶ Γεδεὼν ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἐράβδιζε πυροὺς ἐν ληνῷ, τοῦ ἐκφυγεῖν ἐκ προσώπου Μαδιάμ.
**12.** Καὶ εὗρεν αὐτὸν ἄγγελος Κυρίου, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτόν· Κύριος μετὰ σοῦ, δυνατὸς ἐν τῇ ἰσχύϊ.
**13.** Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτὸν Γεδεών· ἐν ἐμοὶ, κύριε· καὶ εἰ ἔστι Κύριος μεθ᾿ ἡμῶν, καὶ ἵνατί εὗρεν ἡμᾶς πάντα τὰ κακὰ ταῦτα; καὶ ποῦ ἐστι πάντα τὰ θαυμάσια αὐτοῦ, ὅσα διηγήσαντο ἡμῖν οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν, λέγοντες· οὐχὶ ἐξ Αἰγύπτου ἐξήγαγεν ἡμᾶς Κύριος; καὶ νῦν ἀπώσατο ἡμᾶς Κύριος, καὶ παρέδωκεν ἡμᾶς ἐν χειρὶ Μαδιάμ.
**14.** Καὶ ἐπέβλεψε πρὸς αὐτὸν ὁ ἄγγελος Κυρίου, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· πορεύου ἐν τῇ ἰσχύϊ σου ταύτῃ, καὶ σώσεις τὸν Ἰσραὴλ ἐκ χειρὸς Μαδιάμ· καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐξαπέστειλά σε.
**15.** Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτὸν Γεδεών· ἐν ἐμοὶ, κύριε, ἐν τίνι σώσω τὸν Ἰσραήλ; ἰδοὺ ἡ χιλιάς μου ταπεινοτέρα ἐν Μανασσῇ, καὶ ἐγὼ εἰμι μικρὸς ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ πατρός μου.
**16.** Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτὸν ὁ ἄγγελος Κυρίου· ἔτι Κύριος ἔσται μετὰ σοῦ, καὶ πατάξεις τὴν Μαδιὰμ ὡσεὶ ἄνδρα ἕνα.

**JUDGES**
**CHAPTER 6.**

**2.** ...from the face of Midian did the children of Israel make for themselves dens in the mountains, and caves, and strongholds.
**3.** And it came to pass, when a man of Israel did sow, that Midian came up, and Amalek, and the children of the East; and they came up against him.
**4.** And they encamped against them, and destroyed the produce of the earth, until one came unto Gaza; and they left no [means of] subsistence for life in Israel, neither flock, nor calf, nor ass.
**5.** For they themselves and their cattle came up, and they brought along their tents, and they came as locusts for multitude; and of them and their camels there was no number. And they came into the land of Israel, to destroy it.
**6.** And Israel became exceedingly impoverished by reason of Midian; and the children of Israel cried out unto the Lord.
**7.** And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord on account of Midian,
**8.** that the Lord sent a prophet unto the children of Israel, and he said unto them, "Thus saith the Lord God of Israel: I am He that brought you up from Egypt,
**9.** and I brought you forth from the house of bondage. And I delivered you from the hand of Egypt, and from the hand of all those who did oppress you; and I cast them out from before your face, and I gave you their land.
**10.** And I said unto you, 'I am the Lord your God; ye shall not fear the gods of the Amorite, in whose land ye now dwell.' But ye hearkened not unto My voice."
**11.** And there came an Angel of the Lord, and sat beneath the oak that was in Ephra, [which was] of Joash the father of Jezri. And Gideon, his son, was threshing wheat in the winepress, that he might escape from the face of Midian.
**12.** And the Angel of the Lord found him, and said unto him, "The Lord is with thee, thou mighty one in strength!"
**13.** And Gideon said unto him, "Oh, my Lord! If the Lord be with us, then wherefore have all these evils found us? And where are all His wondrous works, of which our fathers told us, saying, 'Did not the Lord bring us out of Egypt?' But now the Lord hath cast us away, and delivered us into the hand of Midian."
**14.** And the Angel of the Lord looked upon him, and said unto him, "Go in this thy strength, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of Midian. Behold, I have sent thee."
**15.** And Gideon said unto him, "Oh, my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? Behold, my clan is the humblest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house."
**16.** And the Angel of the Lord said unto him, "Surely the Lord shall be with thee, and thou shalt smite Midian as one man."
