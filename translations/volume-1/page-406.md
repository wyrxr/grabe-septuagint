2 καὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἅμα πάντες.
3 Καὶ οἱ κατοικοῦντες Γαβαὼν ἤκουσαν πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν Ἰησοῦς τῇ Ἰεριχὼ καὶ τῇ Γαι.
4 Καὶ καί γε αὐτοὶ μετὰ πανουργίας, καὶ ἐλθόντες ἐπεσιτίσαντο καὶ ἡτοιμάσαντο· καὶ λαβόντες σάκκους παλαιοὺς ἐπὶ τῶν ὄνων αὑτῶν, καὶ ἀσκοὺς οἴνου παλαιοὺς καὶ κατεῤῥωγότας καὶ ἀποδεδημένους·
5 καὶ τὰ κοῖλα τῶν ὑποδημάτων αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰ σανδάλια αὐτῶν παλαιὰ καὶ καταπεπελματωμένα ἐν τοῖς ποσὶν αὑτῶν, καὶ τὰ ἱμάτια αὑτῶν πεπαλαιωμένα ἐπ’ αὑτῶν· καὶ οἱ ἄρτοι τοῦ ἐπισιτισμοῦ αὑτῶν ξηροὶ ἐγένοντο καὶ βεβρωμένοι.
6 Καὶ ἦλθον πρὸς Ἰησοῦν εἰς τὴν παρεμβολὴν αὑτῶν εἰς Γάλγαλα, καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς Ἰησοῦν καὶ πρὸς πάντα Ἰσραήλ· ἐκ γῆς μακρόθεν ἥκαμεν· καὶ νῦν διάθεσθε ἡμῖν διαθήκην.
7 Καὶ εἶπαν οἱ υἱοί Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς τὸν Χορραῖον· ἆρα, μὴ ἐν ἐμοὶ σὺ κατώκεις· καὶ πῶς διαθῶμαι σοι διαθήκην;
8 Καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς Ἰησοῦν· οἰκέται σου ἐσμέν. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτοὺς Ἰησοῦς· πόθεν ἐστέ, καὶ πόθεν παραγεγόνατε;
9 Καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς αὐτόν· ἐκ γῆς μακρόθεν σφόδρα ἥκασιν οἱ παῖδες σου ἐν ὀνόματι Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ σου· ἀκηκόαμεν γὰρ τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ,
10 καὶ ἅπαντα ὅσα ἐποίησεν ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ, καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησε τοῖς δυσὶ βασιλεῦσι τῶν Ἀμοῤῥαίων, οἳ ἦσαν πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου, τῷ Σηὼν βασιλεῖ Ἑσεβὼν, καὶ τῷ Ὤγ βασιλεῖ τῆς Βασὰν, ὃς κατῴκει ἐν Ἀσταρὼθ καὶ ἐν Ἑδραείν.
11 Καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς ἡμᾶς οἱ πρεσβύτεροι ἡμῶν καὶ πάντες οἱ κατοικοῦντες τὴν γῆν ἡμῶν, λέγοντες· λάβετε ἑαυτοῖς ἐπισιτισμὸν εἰς τὴν ὁδὸν, καὶ πορευθῆτε εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐρεῖτε πρὸς αὐτούς· οἰκέται ὑμῶν ἐσμέν, καὶ νῦν διάθεσθε ἡμῖν διαθήκην.
12 Οὗτοι οἱ ἄρτοι ἡμῶν· θερμοὺς ἐφωδιάσθημεν αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ οἴκων ἡμῶν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ᾗ ἐξήλθομεν παραγενέσθαι πρὸς ὑμᾶς· νῦν δὲ ἰδοὺ ἐξηράνθησαν, καὶ γεγόνασι βεβρωμένοι.
13 Καὶ οὗτοι οἱ ἀσκοὶ τοῦ οἴνου οὓς ἐπλήσαμεν καινοὺς, καὶ οὗτοι ἐξῤῥάγασι· καὶ ταῦτα τὰ ἱμάτια ἡμῶν καὶ τὰ ὑποδήματα ἡμῶν πεπαλαίνονται ἀπὸ τῆς πολλῆς ὁδοῦ σφόδρα.
14 Καὶ ἔλαβον οἱ ἄρχοντες τοῦ ἐπισιτισμοῦ αὐτῶν, καὶ τὸ στόμα Κυρίου οὐκ ἐπηρώτησαν.
15 Καὶ ἐποίησεν Ἰησοῦς πρὸς αὐτοὺς εἰρήνην, καὶ διέθετο πρὸς αὐτοὺς διαθήκην, τοῦ διασῶσαι αὐτούς· καὶ ὤμοσαν αὐτοῖς οἱ ἄρχοντες τῆς συναγωγῆς.
16 Καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ τρεῖς ἡμέρας μετὰ τὸ διαθέσθαι πρὸς αὐτοὺς διαθήκην, ἤκουσαν ὅτι ἐγγύθεν εἰσὶν αὐτῶν, καὶ ὅτι ἐν αὐτοῖς κατοικοῦσι.

**Joshua 9**
2 ...and Israel, all of them together.
3 Now when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard all that Joshua had done unto Jericho and unto Ai,
4 They, in their turn, did deal with craftiness, and went and prepared [their] provisions; and they took old sacks upon their asses, and wineskins, old and rent and loosened;
5 And their shoes, even their sandals, were old and patched upon their feet; and their raiment was worn upon them; and the bread of their provisions was dry and had become moldy.
6 And they came unto Joshua into their camp at Gilgal, and said unto Joshua and unto all Israel, From a far country are we come; and now, make ye a covenant with us.
7 And the sons of Israel said unto the Horite, Surely, thou dost not dwell among us? and how then shall I make a covenant with thee?
8 And they said unto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua said unto them, Whence are ye? and whence are ye come?
9 And they said unto him, From a very far country are thy servants come, because of the Name of the Lord thy God; for we have heard the fame of Him,
10 And all that He did in Egypt; and all that He did unto the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond Jordan, unto Sihon king of Heshbon, and unto Og king of Bashan, who dwelt in Astaroth and in Edrain.
11 And our elders and all the inhabitants of our land spake unto us, saying, Take ye provisions for yourselves for the journey, and go to meet them, and ye shall say unto them, We are your servants; and now, make ye a covenant with us.
12 Behold these our loaves, which we did take hot from our houses as provision on the day we set forth to come unto you; but now, behold, they are dry and have become moldy.
13 And these are our wineskins, which we filled when they were new, and these have burst; and these our garments and our shoes are worn old from the very long journey.
14 And the leaders received their provisions, and did not inquire of the mouth of the Lord.
15 And Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them, to preserve them alive; and the leaders of the congregation swore unto them.
16 And it came to pass after three days, after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they were near them, and that they dwelt among them.
17 And the sons [of Israel] departed...
