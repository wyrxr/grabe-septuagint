7 σε, καὶ ἀποδώσει τὴν πλημμέλειαν αὐτοῦ τὸ κεφάλαιον αὐτοῦ,
καὶ τὸ ἐπίπεμπτον αὐτοῦ προσθήσει ἐπ᾿ αὐτό, καὶ ἀποδώσει τίνι
ἐπλημμέλησεν αὐτῷ.
8 Ἐὰν δὲ μὴ ᾖ τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ ἀγχιστεύων, ὥστε ἀποδοῦναι αὐτῷ τὸ πλημμέλημα πρὸς αὐτόν, τὸ πλήμμελημα τὸ ἀποδιδόμενον τῷ Κυρίῳ, τῷ ἱερεῖ ἔσται, πλὴν τοῦ κριοῦ τοῦ ἐξιλασμοῦ, δι᾿ οὗ ἐξιλάσεται ἐν αὐτῷ περὶ αὐτοῦ.
9 Καὶ πᾶσα ἀπαρχὴ κατὰ πάντα τὰ ἁγιαζόμενα ἐν υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ, ὅσα ἐὰν προσφέρωσι Κυρίῳ, τῷ ἱερεῖ αὐτῷ ἔσται·
10 καὶ ἑκάστου τὸ ἡγιασμένα αὐτοῦ αὐτῷ ἔσται· καὶ ἀνήρ, ὃς ἂν δῶ τῷ ἱερεῖ, αὐτῷ ἔσται.
11 Καὶ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, λέγων·
12 Λάλησον τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτούς· ἀνδρὸς ἀνδρὸς ἐὰν παραβῇ ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ, καὶ παρίδῃ αὐτὸν ὑπεριδοῦσα, καὶ κοιμηθῇ μετ᾿ αὐτῆς τις κοίτην σπέρματος,
13 καὶ λάθῃ ἐξ ὀφθαλμῶν τοῦ ἀνδρὸς αὐτῆς, καὶ κρύφῃ, αὐτῇ δὲ ᾖ μεμιασμένη, καὶ μάρτυς μὴ ᾖ κατ᾿ αὐτῆς, καὶ αὐτὴ μὴ ᾖ συνελημμένη,
14 καὶ ἐπέλθῃ αὐτῷ πνεῦμα ζηλώσεως, καὶ ζηλώσῃ τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ, αὐτὴ δὲ μεμίανται, ἢ ἐπέλθῃ αὐτῷ πνεῦμα ζηλώσεως, καὶ ζηλώσῃ τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ, αὐτὴ δὲ μὴ ᾖ μεμιασμένη,
15 καὶ ἄξει ὁ ἄνθρωπος τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ πρὸς τὸν ἱερέα, καὶ οἴσει τὸ δῶρον αὐτῆς περὶ αὐτῆς, τὸ δέκατον τοῦ οἰφὶ ἀλεύρου κριθίνου· οὐκ ἐπιχεεῖ ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸ ἔλαιον, οὐδὲ ἐπιθήσει ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸ λίβανον· ἔστι γὰρ θυσία ζηλοτυπίας, θυσία μνημοσύνου, ἀναμιμνήσκουσα ἁμαρτίαν.
16 Καὶ προσάξει αὐτὴν ὁ ἱερεύς, καὶ στήσει αὐτὴν ἔναντι Κυρίου·
17 καὶ λήψεται ὁ ἱερεὺς ὕδωρ καθαρὸν ζῶν ἐν ἀγγείῳ ὀστρακίνῳ, καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς τῆς οὔσης ἐπὶ τοῦ ἐδάφους τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου, καὶ λαβὼν ὁ ἱερεὺς ἐμβαλεῖ εἰς τὸ ὕδωρ·
18 καὶ στήσει ὁ ἱερεὺς τὴν γυναῖκα ἔναντι Κυρίου, καὶ ἀποκαλύψει τὴν κεφαλὴν τῆς γυναικός, καὶ δώσει ἐπὶ τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῆς τὴν θυσίαν τοῦ μνημοσύνου, τὴν θυσίαν τῆς ζηλοτυπίας· ἐν δὲ τῇ χειρὶ τοῦ ἱερέως ἔσται τὸ ὕδωρ τοῦ ἐλεγμοῦ τὸ ἐπικαταρώμενον τοῦτο.
19 Καὶ ὁρκιεῖ αὐτὴν ὁ ἱερεύς, καὶ ἐρεῖ τῇ γυναικί· εἰ μὴ κεκοίμηταί τις μετὰ σοῦ, καὶ εἰ μὴ παραβέβηκας μιανθῆναι ὑπὸ τὸν ἄνδρα τὸν σεαυτῆς, ἀθῶα ἴσθι ἀπὸ τοῦ ὕδατος τοῦ ἐλεγμοῦ τοῦ ἐπικαταρωμένου τούτου·
20 εἰ δὲ σὺ παραβέβηκας ὕπανδρος οὖσα, ἢ μεμίανσαι, καὶ ἔδωκέ τις τὴν κοίτην αὑτοῦ ἐν σοί, πλὴν τοῦ ἀνδρός σου,
21 (καὶ ὁρκιεῖ ὁ ἱερεὺς τὴν γυναῖκα ἐν τοῖς ὅρκοις τῆς ἀρᾶς ταύτης, καὶ ἐρεῖ ὁ ἱερεὺς τῇ γυναικί·)

### NUMBERS. CHAPTER 5

7.  And he shall restore his trespass, the principal thereof, and shall add a fifth part unto it; and he shall give it unto him against whom he hath trespassed.
8.  But if the man have no kinsman to whom recompense may be made for the trespass, the trespass [that is] to be recompensed unto the LORD shall be the priest’s; save the ram of atonement, whereby he shall make atonement for him.
9.  And every heave offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, whatsoever they bring unto the LORD, shall be the priest’s.
10. And every man’s hallowed things shall be his; and whatsoever a man giveth to the priest, it shall be his.

11. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying:
12. Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: When a man’s wife, yea, a man’s wife, shall go astray, and act unfaithfully against him, having treated him with scorn, and a man shall lie with her carnally;
13. And it be hidden from the eyes of her husband, and be kept secret; and she be defiled, and there be no witness against her, and she herself be not taken [in the act];
14. And the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous over his wife, and she be defiled; or the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous over his wife, and she be not defiled:
15. Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and he shall bring her offering for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense thereon: for it is a sacrifice of jealousy, a sacrifice of memorial, bringing to remembrance iniquity.
16. And the priest shall bring her near, and shall set her before the LORD:
17. And the priest shall take holy living water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is upon the floor of the tabernacle of witness, and the priest shall take [it] and cast [it] into the water:
18. And the priest shall set the woman before the LORD, and uncover the woman’s head, and put in her hands the sacrifice of memorial, the sacrifice of jealousy: and in the hand of the priest shall be the water of conviction, this water of the curse.
19. And the priest shall adjure her, and say unto the woman: If no man hath lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone astray to be defiled under thine own husband, be thou innocent from this water of conviction, this water of the curse.
20. But if thou hast gone astray, being under [thy] husband, or hast been defiled, and a man hath given his seed unto thee, besides thy husband,
21. (Then the priest shall adjure the woman with these oaths of the curse, and the priest shall say unto the woman:)
