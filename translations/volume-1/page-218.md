## ΛΕΥΙΤΙΚΟΝ 203
### ΚΕΦ. Ιϛʹ. XVI.

1.  Καὶ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, μετὰ τὸ τελευτῆσαι τοὺς δύο υἱοὺς ᾿Ααρών, ἐν τῷ προσάγειν αὐτοὺς πῦρ ἀλλότριον ἔναντι Κυρίου, καὶ ἐτελεύτησαν.
2.  Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, (λέγων·) λάλησον πρὸς ᾿Ααρὼν τὸν ἀδελφόν σου, καὶ μὴ εἰσπορεύεσθω πᾶσαν ὥραν εἰς τὸ ἅγιον ἐσώτερον τοῦ καταπετάσματος εἰς πρόσωπον τοῦ ἱλαστηρίου, ὃ ἐστιν ἐπὶ τῆς κιβωτοῦ τοῦ μαρτυρίου, καὶ οὐκ ἀποθανεῖται· ἐν γὰρ νεφέλῃ ὀφθήσομαι ἐπὶ τοῦ ἱλαστηρίου.
3.  Οὕτως εἰσελεύσεται ᾿Ααρὼν εἰς τὸ ἅγιον· ἐν μόσχῳ ἐκ βοῶν περὶ ἁμαρτίας, καὶ κριὸν εἰς ὁλοκαύτωμα.
4.  Καὶ χιτῶνα λινοῦν ἡγιασμένον ἐνδύσεται, καὶ περισκελὲς λινοῦν ἔσται ἐπὶ τοῦ χρωτὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ κίδαρις περὶ τὸν τράχηλον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ζώνῃ λινῇ ζώσεται· (ἁγίασμά ἐστι·) καὶ λούσεται ὕδατι πᾶν τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐνδύσεται αὐτά.
5.  Καὶ παρὰ τῆς συναγωγῆς τῶν υἱῶν ᾿Ισραὴλ λήψεται δύο χιμάρους ἐξ αἰγῶν περὶ ἁμαρτίας, καὶ κριὸν ἕνα εἰς ὁλοκαύτωμα.
6.  Καὶ προσάξει ᾿Ααρὼν τὸν μόσχον τὸν περὶ τῆς ἁμαρτίας τὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐξιλάσεται περὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ.
7.  Καὶ λήψεται τοὺς δύο χιμάρους, καὶ στήσει αὐτοὺς ἔναντι Κυρίου παρὰ τὴν θύραν τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου·
8.  καὶ ἐπιθήσει ᾿Ααρὼν ἐπὶ τοὺς δύο χιμάρους κλήρους· κλῆρον ἕνα τῷ Κυρίῳ, καὶ κλῆρον ἕνα τῷ ἀποπομπαίῳ.
9.  Καὶ προσάξει ᾿Ααρὼν τὸν χίμαρον, ἐφ᾿ ὃν ἐπῆλθεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν ὁ κλῆρος τῷ Κυρίῳ, καὶ προσοίσει περὶ ἁμαρτίας·
10. καὶ τὸν χίμαρον, ἐφ᾿ ὃν ἐπῆλθεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν ὁ κλῆρος τοῦ ἀποπομπαίου, στήσει αὐτὸν ζῶντα ἔναντι Κυρίου, τοῦ ἐξιλάσασθαι ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῦ, ὥστε ἀποστεῖλαι αὐτὸν εἰς τὴν ἀποπομπὴν, καὶ ἀφήσει αὐτὸν εἰς τὴν ἔρημον.
11. Καὶ προσάξει ᾿Ααρὼν τὸν μόσχον τὸν περὶ τῆς ἁμαρτίας τὸν αὐτοῦ (καὶ τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ μόνον), καὶ ἐξιλάσεται περὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ· καὶ σφάξει τὸν μόσχον τὸν περὶ τῆς ἁμαρτίας τὸν αὐτοῦ.
12. Καὶ λήψεται τὸ πυρεῖον πλῆρες ἀνθράκων πυρὸς ἀπὸ τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου, τοῦ ἀπέναντι Κυρίου, καὶ πλήσει τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ θυμιάματος συνθέσεως λεπτῆς, καὶ εἰσοίσει ἐσώτερον τοῦ καταπετάσματος,
13. καὶ ἐπιθήσει τὸ θυμίαμα ἐπὶ τὸ πῦρ ἔναντι Κυρίου· καὶ καλύψει ἡ ἀτμὶς τοῦ θυμιάματος τὸ ἱλαστήριον τὸ ἐπὶ τῶν μαρτυρίων, καὶ οὐκ ἀποθανεῖται.

### LEVITICUS 203
### CHAPTER XVI.

1.  And the Lord spake unto Moses, after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they drew near to offer strange fire before the Lord, and so they perished.
2.  And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all seasons into the holy place, within the veil, before the propitiatory which is upon the ark of the testimonies; lest he die: for in a cloud will I appear upon the propitiatory.
3.  Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock from the herd for a sin offering, and a ram for a whole burnt offering.
4.  And a holy linen tunic shall he put on, and linen breeches shall be upon his flesh, and a linen turban about his neck, and with a linen girdle shall he gird himself; (for it is a holy vestment:) and he shall wash all his body with water, and [then] put them on.
5.  And from the congregation of the children of Israel shall he take two he-goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a whole burnt offering.
6.  And Aaron shall bring his young bullock for the sin offering, and shall make propitiation for himself and for his house.
7.  And he shall take the two he-goats, and shall present them before the Lord by the door of the Tabernacle of the Testimony;
8.  and Aaron shall cast lots upon the two he-goats: one lot for the Lord, and the other lot for the scapegoat.
9.  And Aaron shall bring forth the he-goat upon which the Lord's lot fell, and shall offer him for a sin offering.
10. But the he-goat, upon which the lot fell for the scapegoat, shall he present alive before the Lord, to make propitiation upon him, so that he may send him into the wilderness for removal; and he shall release him into the desert.
11. And Aaron shall bring his young bullock for the sin offering (even for himself and his house only), and shall make propitiation for himself and for his house; and he shall slay his young bullock for the sin offering.
12. And he shall take the censer, full of burning coals of fire from off the altar which is before the Lord, and fill his hands with fine incense of composition, and shall bring it within the veil;
13. and he shall put the incense upon the fire before the Lord; and the cloud of the incense shall cover the propitiatory that is upon the testimonies, that he die not.
