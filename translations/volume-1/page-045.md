**ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ ΚΕΦ. ΙΘ΄. Κ΄.**

**29** καὶ Γομόῤῥας, καὶ ἐπὶ πρόσωπον τῆς γῆς τῆς περιχώρου, καὶ
ἴδε· καὶ ἰδοὺ ἀνέβαινε φλὸξ τῆς γῆς, ὡσεὶ ἀτμὶς καμίνου. Καὶ
ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἐκτρῖψαι Κύριον πάσας τὰς πόλεις τῆς περιοίκου,
ἐμνήσθη δ Θεὸς τοῦ Ἀβραάμ, καὶ ἐξαπέστειλε τὸν Λὼτ ἐκ μέσου
τῆς καταστροφῆς, ἐν τῷ καταστρέψαι Κύριον τὰς πόλεις, ἐν
**30** αἷς κατῴκει ἐν αὐταῖς Λώτ. Καὶ ἐξῆλθε Λὼτ ἐκ Σηγὼρ, καὶ ἐκάθητο
ἐν τῷ ὄρει, καὶ αἱ δύο θυγατέρες αὐτοῦ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ· ἐφοβήθη γὰρ
κατοικῆσαι ἐν Σηγώρ, καὶ ᾤκησεν ἐν τῷ σπηλαίῳ, αὐτὸς καὶ αἱ δύο
**31** θυγατέρες αὐτοῦ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ. Εἶπε δὲ ἡ πρεσβυτέρα πρὸς τὴν
νεωτέραν· ὁ πατὴρ ἡμῶν πρεσβύτερος, καὶ οὐδεὶς ἐστιν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς,
ὃς εἰσελεύσεται πρὸς ἡμᾶς, ὡς καθήκει πάσῃ τῇ
**32** γῇ· δεῦρο οὖν, ποτίσωμεν τὸν πατέρα ἡμῶν οἶνον, καὶ κοιμηθῶμεν
μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐξαναστήσωμεν ἐκ τοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν σπέρμα.
**33** Ἐπότισαν δὲ τὸν πατέρα αὐτῶν οἶνον ἐν τῇ νυκτὶ ταύτῃ, καὶ εἰσελθοῦσα
ἡ πρεσβυτέρα, ἐκοιμήθη μετὰ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῆς τὴν νύκτα ἐκείνην·
καὶ οὐκ ᾔδει ἐν τῷ κοιμηθῆναι αὐτήν, καὶ ἀναστῆναι.
**34** Ἐγένετο δὲ τῇ ἐπαύριον, καὶ εἶπεν ἡ πρεσβυτέρα πρὸς τὴν νεωτέραν·
Ἰδοὺ ἐκοιμήθην ἐχθὲς μετὰ τοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν· ποτίσωμεν αὐτὸν οἶνον
καὶ τὴν νύκτα ταύτην, καὶ εἰσελθοῦσα κοιμηθήτι μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ
ἐξαναστήσωμεν ἐκ τοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν σπέρμα.
**35** Ἐπότισαν δὲ καὶ ἐν τῇ νυκτὶ ἐκείνῃ τὸν πατέρα αὐτῶν οἶνον, καὶ
εἰσελθοῦσα ἡ νεωτέρα, ἐκοιμήθη μετὰ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῆς· καὶ οὐκ
**36** ᾔδει ἐν τῷ κοιμηθῆναι αὐτήν, καὶ ἀναστῆναι. Καὶ συνέλαβον αἱ
**37** δύο θυγατέρες Λὼτ ἐκ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἔτεκεν ἡ πρεσβυτέρα
υἱὸν, καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Μωάβ, λέγουσα· ἐκ τοῦ πατρός μου.
Οὗτος πατὴρ Μωαβιτῶν ἕως τῆς σήμερον ἡμέρας.
**38** Ἔτεκε δὲ καὶ ἡ νεωτέρα υἱὸν, καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ἀμμάμ,
ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ γένους μου. Οὗτος πατὴρ Ἀμμανιτῶν ἕως τῆς σήμερον
ἡμέρας.

**ΚΕΦ. Κ΄. ΧΧ.**

**1** Καὶ ἐκίνησεν ἐκεῖθεν Ἀβραὰμ εἰς γῆν πρὸς λίβα, καὶ ᾤκησεν
ἀνὰ μέσον Κάδης, καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον Σούρ· καὶ παρῴκησεν ἐν
**2** Γεράροις. Εἶπε δὲ Ἀβραὰμ περὶ Σάῤῥας τῆς γυναικὸς αὐτοῦ, (ὅτι)
ἀδελφή μου ἐστίν· ἐφοβήθη γὰρ εἰπεῖν ὅτι γυνή μου ἐστὶ, μή ποτε
ἀποκτείνωσιν αὐτὸν οἱ ἄνδρες τῆς πόλεως δι᾿ αὐτήν. Ἀπέστειλε

**Genesis Chapter 19**

**29** And Gomorrah, and upon the face of the land of the plain. And he looked,
and behold, a flame from the earth ascended, as the vapor of a furnace.
And it came to pass, when the Lord destroyed all the cities of the plain,
[that] God remembered Abraham, and sent forth Lot out of the midst
of the overthrow, when the Lord overthrew the cities, in
**30** which Lot had dwelt within them. And Lot departed out of Segor, and dwelt
in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared
to dwell in Segor: and he dwelt in the cave, he and his two
**31** daughters with him. And the elder daughter said unto the
younger, "Our father is old, and there is no man upon the earth
who shall come in unto us, as is the custom throughout all
**32** the earth. Come now, therefore, let us give our father wine to drink, and let us lie
with him, that we may raise up seed from our father."
**33** And they gave their father wine to drink that night; and the elder daughter went in
and lay with her father that night; and he knew not when she lay down,
nor when she arose.
**34** And it came to pass on the morrow, that the elder daughter said unto the younger,
"Behold, I lay yesternight with our father. Let us cause him to drink wine
this night also, and do thou go in and lie with him, that
we may raise up seed from our father."
**35** And they gave their father wine to drink that night also; and
the younger daughter went in and lay with her father; and he knew not
**36** when she lay down, nor when she arose. And the two
**37** daughters of Lot conceived by their father. And the elder daughter bore
a son, and she called his name Moab, saying, "[He is] from my father."
He is the father of the Moabites unto this very day.
**38** And the younger daughter, she also bore a son, and she called his name Amman,
saying, "The son of my kindred." He is the father of the Ammanites unto this
very day.

**Chapter 20**

**1** And Abraham journeyed from thence into the land towards the south, and dwelt
between Kadesh and between Shur; and he sojourned in
**2** Gerar. And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, (that) "She is my sister;"
for he feared to say that she was his wife, lest perhaps
the men of the city should slay him for her sake. [And King Abimelech] sent
