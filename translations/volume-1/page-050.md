τὸ σπέρμα σου, ὡς τοὺς ἀστέρας τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ ὡς τὴν ἄμμον τὴν παρὰ τὸ χεῖλος τῆς θαλάσσης, καὶ κληρονομήσει τὸ σπέρμα σου τὰς πόλεις τῶν ὑπεναντίων· καὶ εὐλογηθήσονται ἐν τῷ 18 σπέρματί σου πάντα τὰ ἔθνη τῆς γῆς, ἀνθ᾿ ὧν ὑπήκουσας τῆς ἐμῆς φωνῆς. Ἀπεστράφη δὲ Ἀβραὰμ πρὸς τοὺς παῖδας αὐτοῦ, καὶ 19 ἀναστάντες ἐπορεύθησαν ἅμα ἐπὶ τὸ φρέαρ τοῦ ὅρκου· καὶ κατῴκησεν Ἀβραὰμ ἐπὶ τῷ φρέατι τοῦ ὅρκου. Ἐγένετο δὲ μετὰ τὰ 20 ῥήματα ταῦτα, καὶ ἀνηγγέλη τῷ Ἀβραάμ, λέγοντες· Ἰδοὺ τέτοκε Μελεχὰ καὶ αὐτὴ υἱοὺς τῷ Ναχὼρ τῷ ἀδελφῷ σου, τὸν Ὡζ πρω- 21 τότοκον, καὶ τὸν Βαὺξ ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὸν Καμουὴλ πατέρα Σύρων, καὶ τὸν Χασζάδ, καὶ τὸν Ἀζαῦ, καὶ τὸν Φαλδὰς, καὶ τὸν 22 Ἱελδὰφ, καὶ τὸν Βαθουὴλ· καὶ Βαθουὴλ ἐγέννησε τὴν Ῥεβέκκαν· 23 ὀκτὼ οὗτοι υἱοὶ, οὓς ἔτεκε Μελεχὰ τῷ Ναχὼρ τῷ ἀδελφῷ Ἀβραάμ. Καὶ ἡ παλλακὴ αὐτοῦ ἡ ὄνομα Ῥεύμα, ἔτεκε καὶ αὐτὴ τὸν Τα- 24 βὲχ, καὶ τὸν Γαάμ, καὶ τὸν Τοχὸς, καὶ τὸν Μωχά.

ΕΓΕΝΕΤΟ δὲ ἡ ζωὴ Σάρρας ἔτη ἑκατὸν εἰκοσιεπτά, ἔτη ζωῆς 1 Σάρρας. Καὶ ἀπέθανε Σάρρα ἐν πόλει Ἀρβὸκ, ἥ ἐστιν ἐν τῷ κοιλώματι· αὕτη ἐστι Χεβρὼν ἐν γῇ Χαναάν. Ἦλθε δὲ Ἀβραὰμ κό- 2 ψασθαι Σάρραν, καὶ πενθῆσαι. Καὶ ἀνέστη Ἀβραὰμ ἀπὸ τοῦ νεκροῦ 3 αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπεν (Ἀβραὰμ) τοῖς υἱοῖς Χέτ, λέγων· πάροικος καὶ 4 παρεπίδημος ἐγώ εἰμι μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν· δότε οὖν μοι κτῆσιν τάφου μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν, καὶ θάψω τὸν νεκρόν μου ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ. Ἀπεκρίθησαν δὲ οἱ 5 υἱοὶ Χὲτ πρὸς Ἀβραάμ, λέγοντες· μὴ κύριε· ἄκουσον δὲ ἡμῶν. 6 βασιλεὺς παρὰ Θεοῦ σὺ εἶ ἐν ἡμῖν· ἐν τοῖς ἐκλεκτοῖς μνημείοις ἡμῶν θάψον τὸν νεκρόν σου· οὐδεὶς γὰρ ἡμῶν τὸ μνημεῖον αὐτοῦ κωλύσει ἀπὸ σοῦ, τοῦ θάψαι τὸν νεκρόν σου ἐκεῖ. Ἀναστὰς δὲ 7 Ἀβραὰμ προσεκύνησε τῷ λαῷ τῆς γῆς, τοῖς υἱοῖς Χέτ· καὶ ἐ- 8 λάλησε πρὸς αὐτοὺς Ἀβραάμ, λέγων· εἰ ἔχετε τῇ ψυχῇ ὑμῶν, ὡς τε θάψαι τὸν νεκρόν μου ἀπὸ προσώπου μου, ἀκούσατέ μου, καὶ λαλήσατε περὶ ἐμοῦ Ἔφρων τῷ τοῦ Σαὰρ, καὶ δότω μοι τὸ σπή- 9 λαιον τὸ διπλοῦν ὅ ἐστιν αὐτῷ, τὸ ὂν ἐν μερίδι τοῦ ἀγροῦ αὐτοῦ· ἀργυρίου τοῦ ἀξίου δότω μοι αὐτὸ ἐν ὑμῖν εἰς κτῆσιν μνημείου. Ἔφρων δὲ ἐκάθητο ἐν μέσῳ τῶν υἱῶν Χέτ. Ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ Ἔφρων 10

<br/>
<sup>17</sup>Your seed, like the stars of the heaven, and like the sand which is by the seashore; and your seed shall inherit the cities of their adversaries.
<sup>18</sup>And in your seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because you have obeyed My voice.
<sup>19</sup>Then Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together unto the well of the oath; and Abraham dwelt at the well of the oath.

<sup>20</sup>And it came to pass after these words, that it was told unto Abraham, saying:
<sup>21</sup>“Behold, Milcah, she also hath borne sons unto Nahor your brother: Uz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of the Syrians,
<sup>22</sup>and Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.”
<sup>23</sup>And Bethuel begat Rebekah. These eight are the sons whom Milcah bore unto Nahor, Abraham's brother.
<sup>24</sup>And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she also bore Tabah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.

<sup>1</sup>And the life of Sarah was one hundred and twenty-seven years; these were the years of the life of Sarah.
<sup>2</sup>And Sarah died in the city of Arbok, which is in the valley; this is Hebron in the land of Canaan. And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep.
<sup>3</sup>And Abraham rose up from before his dead, and [Abraham] spake unto the sons of Heth, saying:
<sup>4</sup>“I am a stranger and a sojourner with you; give me therefore a possession of a burying place with you, that I may bury my dead from before me.”
<sup>5</sup>And the sons of Heth answered Abraham, saying:
<sup>6</sup>“Nay, my lord; hear us: a prince from God are you among us. In the choicest of our sepulchers bury your dead; none of us shall withhold from you his sepulcher, that you may bury your dead there.”
<sup>7</sup>And Abraham rose up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the sons of Heth;
<sup>8</sup>and Abraham spake unto them, saying, “If it be your soul's desire, that I should bury my dead from my presence, hearken unto me, and
<sup>9</sup>entreat for me of Ephron the son of Saar, that he may give me the double cave, which is his, which is in the portion of his field; for the full price in silver let him give it unto me in your midst for a possession of a burying place.”
<sup>10</sup>Now Ephron sat among the sons of Heth. And Ephron answered
