ΚΕΦ ΚΔ´. ΛΕΥΪΤΙΚΟΝ 219
τῆς καθαρᾶς καύσετε τοὺς λύχνους ἔναντι Κυρίου ἕως πρωΐ.
Καὶ λήψεσθε σεμίδαλιν, καὶ ποιήσετε αὐτὴν δώδεκα ἄρτους· δύο 5
δεκάτων ἔσται ὁ ἄρτος ὁ εἷς· καὶ ἐπιθήσετε αὐτοὺς δύο θέματα, 6
ἓξ ἄρτους τὸ ἓν θέμα ἐπὶ τὴν τράπεζαν τὴν καθαρὰν ἔναντι Κυ-
ρίου. Καὶ ἐπιθήσετε ἐπὶ τὸ θέμα λίβανον καθαρὸν καὶ ἅλα, καὶ 7
ἔσονται εἰς ἄρτους εἰς ἀνάμνησιν προκείμενα τῷ Κυρίῳ· τῇ ἡμέ- 8
ρᾳ τῶν σαββάτων προθήσεται ἔναντι Κυρίου διαπαντὸς ἐνώπιον
τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, διαθήκην αἰώνιον. Καὶ ἔσται Ἀαρὼν καὶ τοῖς 9
υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ, καὶ φάγονται αὐτὰ ἐν τόπῳ ἁγίῳ· ἔσται γὰρ ἁγία
τῶν ἁγίων τοῦτο αὐτῷ ἀπὸ τῶν θυσιαζομένων τῷ Κυρίῳ, νό-
μιμον αἰώνιον. Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν υἱὸς γυναικὸς Ἰσραηλίτιδος, (καὶ οὗ- 10
τος ἦν υἱὸς Αἰγυπτίου ἐν τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ) καὶ ἐμαχέσαντο ἐν
τῇ παρεμβολῇ ὁ ἐκ τῆς Ἰσραηλίτιδος, καὶ ὁ ἄνθρωπος ὁ Ἰσραη-
λίτης· καὶ ἐπονομάσας υἱὸς τῆς γυναικὸς Ἰσραηλίτιδος τὸ ὄνομα, 11
κατηράσατο, καὶ ἤγαγον αὐτὸν πρὸς Μωυσῆν· καὶ τὸ ὄνομα τῆς
μητρὸς αὐτοῦ Σαλωμεὶθ θυγάτηρ Δαβρὶ ἐκ τῆς φυλῆς Δὰν· καὶ ἀπέ- 12
θεντο αὐτὸν ἐν φυλακῇ, διακρῖναι αὐτὸν διὰ προστάγματος Κυρίου.
13 Καὶ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, λέγων· ἐξάγαγε τὸν κα- 14
ταρασάμενον ἔξω τῆς παρεμβολῆς, καὶ ἐπιθήσουσι πάντες οἱ ἀκού-
σαντες τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ, καὶ λιθοβολή-
σουσι αὐτὸν πᾶσα ἡ συναγωγή. Καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραὴλ λάλησον, 15
καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτούς· ἄνθρωπος ἄνθρωπος ὃς ἐὰν καταράσηται
Θεὸν αὐτοῦ, ἁμαρτίαν αὐτοῦ λήψεται. Ὀνομάζων δὲ τὸ ὄνομα 16
Κυρίου, θανάτῳ θανατούσθω· λίθοις λιθοβολείτω αὐτὸν πᾶσα συ-
ναγωγή (Ἰσραήλ)· ἐάν τε προσήλυτος, ἐάν τε αὐτόχθων, ἐν τῷ
ὀνομάσαι αὐτὸν τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου, τελευτάτω. Καὶ ἄνθρωπος ἐὰν 17
πατάξῃ πᾶσαν ψυχὴν ἀνθρώπου, καὶ ἀποθάνῃ, θανάτῳ θανατού-
σθω. Καὶ ὃς ἂν πατάξῃ κτῆνος, (καὶ ἀποθάνῃ) ἀποτισάτω αὐτό, 18
ψυχὴν ἀντὶ ψυχῆς. Καὶ ἐάν τις δῷ μῶμον τῷ πλησίον αὐτοῦ, ὡς 19
ἐποίησεν αὐτῷ, ὡσαύτως ἀντιποιηθήσεται αὐτῷ· σύντριμμα ἀντὶ συν- 20
τρίμματος, ὀφθαλμὸν ἀντὶ ὀφθαλμοῦ, ὀδόντα ἀντὶ ὀδόντος, καθότι
ἂν δῷ μῶμον τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ, οὕτως δοθήσεται αὐτῷ. Καὶ ὁ τύπ- 21
των κτήνος, ἀποτισάτω αὐτό· ὃς ἂν πατάξῃ ἄνθρωπον, καὶ ἀπο-
θάνῃ, θανάτῳ θανατούσθω. Δικαίωσις μία ὑμῖν ἔσται τῷ προσή- 22
λυτῳ καὶ ἐγχωρίῳ, ὅτι ἐγώ (εἰμι) Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν. Καὶ 23
ἐλάλησε Μωυσῆς τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐξήγαγον τὸν καταρασά-

*Correction note: In verse 20, `ἐδόντα´` has been corrected to `ὀδόντα`. The original rendering was an ungrammatical and textually improbable spelling of "tooth", therefore constituting a clear typo in the original text.*

### Leviticus Chapter 24

**4** of the pure [lampstand], ye shall burn the lamps before the Lord until the morning.

**5** Then shalt thou take fine flour and make of it twelve loaves; **6** two tenths [of an ephah] shall one loaf be; and thou shalt set them in two rows, six loaves in one row, upon the pure table before the Lord. **7** And thou shalt put upon the row pure frankincense and salt, **8** and they shall be for bread for a memorial, set before the Lord. On the day of the Sabbaths it shall be set forth continually before the Lord, **9** before the sons of Israel, for an everlasting covenant. And it shall be for Aaron and for his sons; and they shall eat them in a holy place, for this shall be a most holy [portion] for him, from the offerings sacrificed to the Lord, an everlasting statute.

**10** And there went forth a son of an Israelite woman (and this one was a son of an Egyptian man among the sons of Israel); and they strove in the camp: he that was from the Israelite woman, and the Israelite man. **11** And the son of the Israelite woman, having named The Name, did curse; and they brought him unto Moses. And the name of his mother was Shelomith, daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan. **12** And they put him in custody, to determine concerning him by the commandment of the Lord.

**13** And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying: **14** "Bring forth him that cursed outside the camp, and all who heard shall lay their hands upon his head; and all the congregation shall stone him. **15** And unto the sons of Israel shalt thou speak, saying unto them: 'Any man that shall curse his God shall bear his sin. **16** But he that blasphemes the Name of the Lord shall surely be put to death; with stones shall all the congregation [of Israel] stone him. Whether he be a sojourner, or a native, when he blasphemes the Name of the Lord, he shall surely die.

**17** And if a man strike any person, and he die, he shall surely be put to death. **18** And whoever strikes an animal (and it dies), he shall restore it: life for life. **19** And if a man inflict a blemish on his neighbor, as he did to him, so shall it be done to him in return: **20** fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; as he inflicted a blemish on the man, so shall it be inflicted upon him. **21** And he that strikes an animal shall restore it; but he that strikes a man, and he die, shall surely be put to death. **22** There shall be one judgment for you, for the sojourner and for the native, for I am the Lord your God.'"

**23** And Moses spoke unto the sons of Israel; and they brought forth him that cursed...
