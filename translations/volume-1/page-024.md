Here is the corrected Greek text and its translation:

ΚΕΦ. Ε´.      ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ 9
Θουσάλα ἃς ἔζησεν, ἐννακόσια καὶ ἑξηκοντεννέα ἔτη, καὶ ἀπέθανε.
**28** Καὶ ἔζησε Λάμεχ ἑκατὸν ὀγδοηκοκτὼ ἔτη, καὶ ἐγέννησεν υἱόν.
**29** Καὶ ἐπωνόμασε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Νῶε, λέγων· οὗτος διαναπαύσει ἡμᾶς ἀπὸ τῶν ἔργων ἡμῶν, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν λυπῶν τῶν χειρῶν ἡμῶν, καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς, ἧς κατηράσατο Κύριος ὁ Θεός.
**30** Καὶ ἔζησε Λάμεχ μετὰ τὸ γεννῆσαι αὐτὸν τὸν Νῶε, πεντακόσια καὶ ἑξηκονταπέντε ἔτη, καὶ ἐγέννησεν υἱοὺς καὶ θυγατέρας·
**31** καὶ ἐγένοντο πᾶσαι αἱ ἡμέραι Λάμεχ ἑπτακόσια καὶ πεντηκοντατρία ἔτη, καὶ ἀπέθανε.
**32** Καὶ ἦν Νῶε ἐτῶν πεντακοσίων, καὶ ἐγέννησε Νῶε τρεῖς υἱούς, τὸν Σήμ, τὸν Χάμ, τὸν Ἰάφεθ.

ΚΕΦ. ς´. VI.
**1** ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο ἡνίκα ἤρξαντο οἱ ἄνθρωποι πολλοὶ γίνεσθαι ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, καὶ θυγατέρες ἐγεννήθησαν αὐτοῖς·
**2** ἰδόντες δὲ οἱ ἄγγελοι τοῦ Θεοῦ τὰς θυγατέρας τῶν ἀνθρώπων, ὅτι καλαί εἰσιν, ἔλαβον ἑαυτοῖς γυναῖκας ἀπὸ πασῶν ὧν ἐξελέξαντο.
**3** Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος ὁ Θεός· οὐ μὴ καταμείνῃ τὸ πνεῦμά μου ἐν τοῖς ἀνθρώποις τούτοις εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, διὰ τὸ εἶναι αὐτοὺς σάρκας· ἔσονται δὲ αἱ ἡμέραι αὐτῶν ἑκατὸν εἴκοσιν ἔτη.
**4** Οἱ δὲ γίγαντες ἦσαν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις· καὶ μετ᾽ ἐκεῖνο, ὡς ἂν εἰσεπορεύοντο οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ Θεοῦ πρὸς τὰς θυγατέρας τῶν ἀνθρώπων, καὶ ἐγεννῶσαν ἑαυτοῖς, ἐκεῖνοι ἦσαν οἱ γίγαντες οἱ ἀπ᾽ αἰῶνος, οἱ ἄνθρωποι οἱ ὀνομαστοί.
**5** Ἰδὼν δὲ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὅτι ἐπληθύνθησαν αἱ κακίαι τῶν ἀνθρώπων ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, καὶ πᾶς τις διανοεῖται ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ ἐπιμελῶς ἐπὶ τὰ πονηρὰ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας,
**6** καὶ ἐνεθυμήθη ὁ Θεὸς ὅτι ἐποίησε τὸν ἄνθρωπον ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, καὶ διενοήθη.
**7** Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ Θεός· ἀπαλείψω τὸν ἄνθρωπον ὃν ἐποίησα, ἀπὸ προσώπου τῆς γῆς, ἀπὸ ἀνθρώπου ἕως κτήνους, καὶ ἀπὸ ἑρπετῶν ἕως τῶν πετεινῶν τοῦ οὐρανοῦ· ὅτι ἐθυμώθην ὅτι ἐποίησα αὐτούς.
**8** Νῶε δὲ εὗρε χάριν ἐναντίον Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ.
**9** Αὗται δὲ αἱ γενέσεις Νῶε· Νῶε ἄνθρωπος δίκαιος, τέλειος ὢν ἐν τῇ γενέσει αὐτοῦ, τῷ Θεῷ εὐηρέστησε Νῶε.
**10** Ἐγέννησε δὲ Νῶε τρεῖς υἱούς, τὸν Σήμ, τὸν Χάμ, τὸν Ἰάφεθ.
**11** Ἐφθάρη δὲ ἡ γῆ ἐναντίον τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ ἐπλήσθη ἡ γῆ ἀδικίας.
**12** Καὶ ἴδε Κύριος ὁ Θεός τὴν γῆν, καὶ ἦν κατεφθαρμένη· ὅτι κατέφθειρε πᾶσα σὰρξ

And the days of Θουσάλα, which he lived, were nine hundred and sixty-nine years; and he died.
**28** And Lamech lived an hundred and eighty-eight years, and begat a son.
**29** And he called his name Noah, saying, This [one] shall comfort us concerning our works, and the toil of our hands, and concerning the earth, which the Lord God hath cursed.
**30** And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred and sixty-five years, and begat sons and daughters.
**31** And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred and fifty-three years; and he died.
**32** And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

#### Chapter 6

**1** And it came to pass, when men began to multiply upon the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
**2** then the angels of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took wives for themselves of all whom they chose.
**3** And the Lord God said, My Spirit shall not abide in these men for ever, for that they are flesh: yet their days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
**4** And the giants were upon the earth in those days; and after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bore children to them, those were the giants of old, the men of renown.
**5** And the Lord God saw that the wickedness of men was multiplied upon the earth, and that every man diligently pondered in his heart upon evil continually all his days;
**6** and God remembered that He had made man upon the earth, and He pondered deeply.
**7** And God said, I will blot out man, whom I have made, from the face of the earth; from man unto beast, and from creeping things unto the birds of the heaven; for I am wroth that I have made them.
**8** But Noah found grace in the sight of the Lord God.
**9** These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a righteous man, being perfect in his generation; Noah pleased God.
**10** And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
**11** And the earth was corrupted before God, and the earth was filled with iniquity.
**12** And the Lord God beheld the earth, and, lo, it was corrupted; for all flesh had corrupted
