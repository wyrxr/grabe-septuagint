**ΛΕΥΙΤΙΚΟΝ ΚΕΦ. ΙΗʹ. ΙΘʹ.**

. θυγατέρα τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτῆς, καὶ τὴν θυγατέρα τῆς θυγατρὸς αὐτῆς οὐ λήψῃ, ἀποκαλύψαι τὴν ἀσχημοσύνην αὐτῶν· οἰκεῖαι γάρ σου
18 εἰσίν· ἀσέβημά ἐστι. Γυναῖκα ἐπ᾽ ἀδελφῇ αὐτῆς οὐ λήψῃ ἀντίζηλον, ἀποκαλύψαι τὴν ἀσχημοσύνην αὐτῆς ἐπ᾽ αὐτῇ, ἔτι ζώσης αὐτῆς.
19 Καὶ πρὸς γυναῖκα ἐν χωρισμῷ ἀκαθαρσίας αὐτῆς οὐ προσελεύσῃ ἀποκαλύψαι τὴν ἀσχημοσύνην αὐτῆς.
20 Καὶ πρὸς τὴν γυναῖκα τοῦ πλησίον σου οὐ δώσεις κοίτην σπέρματος σου, τοῦ ἐκμιανθῆναι πρὸς αὐτήν.
21 Καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ σπέρματός σου οὐ δώσεις λατρεύειν ἄρχοντι, καὶ οὐ βεβηλώσεις τὸ ὄνομα τὸ ἅγιον· ἐγὼ Κύριος.
22 Καὶ μετὰ ἄρσενος οὐ κοιμηθήσῃ κοίτην γυναικός· βδέλυγμα γάρ ἐστι.
23 Καὶ πρὸς πᾶν τετράπουν οὐ δώσεις κοίτην σου εἰς σπερματισμόν, ἐκμιανθῆναι πρὸς αὐτό. Καὶ γυνὴ οὐ στήσεται πρὸς πᾶν τετράπουν βιασθῆναι· μυσαρὸν γάρ ἐστι.
24 Μὴ μιαίνεσθε ἐν πᾶσι τούτοις· ἐν πᾶσι γὰρ τούτοις **ἐμιάνθησαν** τὰ ἔθνη, ἃ ἐγὼ ἐξαποστελῶ πρὸ προσώπου ὑμῶν.
25 Καὶ **ἐμιάνθη** ἡ γῆ, καὶ ἀνταπέδωκα ἀδικίαν αὐτῆς δι᾽ αὐτήν, καὶ προσώχθισεν ἡ γῆ ἐν τοῖς ἐγκαθημένοις ἐπ᾽ αὐτῆς.
26 Καὶ φυλάξεσθε πάντα τὰ νόμιμά μου, καὶ τὰ προστάγματά μου, καὶ οὐ ποιήσετε ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν βδελυγμάτων τούτων, ὁ ἐγχώριος, ἢ ὁ προσήλυτος ὁ προσγενόμενος ἐν ὑμῖν.
27 Πάντα γὰρ τὰ βδελύγματα ταῦτα ἐποίησαν οἱ ἄνθρωποι τῆς γῆς, οἱ ὄντες πρότεροι ὑμῶν,
28 καὶ **ἐμιάνθη** ἡ γῆ, ἐν τῷ μιαίνειν ὑμᾶς αὐτήν, ὃν τρόπον προσώχθισεν ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι τοῖς πρὸ ὑμῶν·
29 ὅτι πᾶς ὃς ἂν ποιήσῃ ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν βδελυγμάτων τούτων, ἐξολεθρευθήσονται αἱ ψυχαὶ αἱ ποιοῦσαι ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτῶν.
30 Καὶ φυλάξετε τὰ προστάγματά μου, ὅπως μὴ ποιήσητε ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν νομίμων τῶν ἐβδελυγμένων, ἃ γέγονε πρὸ τοῦ ὑμᾶς, καὶ οὐ μιανθήσεσθε ἐν αὐτοῖς· ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν.

**ΚΕΦ. ΙΘʹ. ΧΙΧ.**

1 ΚΑΙ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, λέγων·
2 λάλησον πάσῃ τῇ συναγωγῇ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτούς· ἅγιοι ἔσεσθε, ὅτι ἐγὼ ἅγιος· Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν.
3 Ἕκαστος πατέρα αὑτοῦ καὶ μητέρα αὑτοῦ φοβείσθω, καὶ τὰ σάββατά μου φυλάξεσθε· ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν.
4 Οὐκ ἐπακολουθήσετε εἰδώλοις, καὶ θεοὺς χωνευτοὺς οὐ ποιήσετε ὑμῖν· ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν.
5 Καὶ ἐὰν

#### LEVITICUS CHAPTERS 18-19

...the daughter of her son, nor the daughter of her daughter shalt thou take, to uncover their nakedness; for these are thy near kinswomen; it is a wickedness.

18 Neither shalt thou take a woman to her sister, [to be] a rival, to uncover her nakedness beside her, while she yet liveth.

19 And unto a woman in the separation of her uncleanness shalt thou not approach, to uncover her nakedness.

20 Moreover, thou shalt not give thy seed's bed unto the wife of thy neighbour, to be defiled with her.

21 And of thy seed shalt thou give none to serve unto a ruler, neither shalt thou profane My holy Name: I am the Lord.

22 Thou shalt not lie with a man as with a woman; for it is an abomination.

23 Neither shalt thou give thy bed unto any four-footed beast to have carnal knowledge, to be defiled with it. And a woman shall not stand before any four-footed beast to be violated; for it is a foul thing.

24 Defile not yourselves in any of these things; for in all these things were the nations defiled, which I shall cast out from before your face.

25 And the land was defiled, and I did repay her iniquity because of her, and the land hath abhorred those who dwell therein.

26 Ye shall therefore keep all My statutes and all My ordinances, and ye shall not commit any of these abominations, neither the native, nor the stranger that sojourneth among you.

27 For all these abominations have the people of the land committed, who were before you,

28 and the land was defiled, even in your defiling it, in the manner it abhorred the nations which were before you.

29 For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, those very souls that commit them shall be utterly cut off from among their people.

30 Therefore shall ye keep My ordinances, that ye commit not any of these abominable customs, which were committed before you, and that ye defile not yourselves thereby: I am the Lord your God.

#### CHAPTER 19

1 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying:

2 "Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be holy; for I am holy: I am the Lord your God.

3 Every man shall fear his father and his mother, and ye shall keep My Sabbaths: I am the Lord your God.

4 Ye shall not turn unto idols, nor make unto yourselves molten gods: I am the Lord your God.

5 And when...
