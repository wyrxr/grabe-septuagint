Αἰλὰμ, καὶ Θαλγὰλ βασιλεὺς ἐθνῶν, ἐποίησαν πόλεμον μετὰ Βαλλὰ βασιλέως Σοδόμων, καὶ μετὰ Βαρσὰ βασιλέως Γομόῤῥας, καὶ Σενναὰρ βασιλέως Ἀδαμὰ, καὶ Συμοβὸρ βασιλέως Σεβωεὶμ, καὶ (μετὰ) βασιλέως Βαλάκ· (αὕτη ἐστὶ Σηγώρ). Πάντες οὗτοι συνεφώνησαν ἐπὶ τὴν φάραγγα τὴν ἁλυκήν· αὕτη ἡ θάλασσα τῶν ἁλῶν. Δώδεκα ἔτη ἐδούλευσον τῷ Χοδολογομόρ· τῷ δὲ τρισκαιδεκάτῳ ἔτει ἀπέστησαν. Ἐν δὲ τῷ τεσσαρεσκαιδεκάτῳ ἔτει ἦλθε Χοδολογομὸρ καὶ οἱ βασιλεῖς οἱ μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ, καὶ κατέκοψαν τοὺς γίγαντας τοὺς ἐν Ἀσταρὼθ Καρναΐν, καὶ ἔθνη ἰσχυρὰ ἅμα αὐτοῖς, καὶ τοὺς Ὁμαίους τοὺς ἐν Σαυὴ τῇ πόλει, καὶ τοὺς Χοῤῥαίους τοὺς ἐν τοῖς ὄρεσι Σηεὶρ, ἕως τῆς τερεμίνθου τῆς Φαρὰν, ἥ ἐστιν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ. Καὶ ἀναστρέψαντες ἦλθον ἐπὶ τὴν πηγὴν τῆς κρίσεως, (αὕτη ἐστὶ Κάδης·) καὶ κατέκοψαν πάντας τοὺς ἄρχοντας Ἀμαλὴκ, καὶ τοὺς Ἀμοῤῥαίους τοὺς κατοικοῦντας ἐν Ἀσασὰν Θαμάρ. Ἐξῆλθε δὲ βασιλεὺς Σοδόμων, καὶ βασιλεὺς Γομόῤῥας, καὶ βασιλεὺς Ἀδαμὰ, καὶ βασιλεὺς Σεβωεὶμ, καὶ βασιλεὺς Βαλάκ, (αὕτη ἐστὶ Σηγώρ) καὶ παρετάξαντο αὐτοῖς εἰς πόλεμον ἐν τῇ κοιλάδι τῇ ἁλυκῇ, πρὸς Χοδολογομὸρ βασιλέα Αἰλὰμ, καὶ Θαλγὰλ βασιλέα ἐθνῶν, καὶ Ἀμαῤῥὰλ βασιλέα Σενναὰρ, καὶ Ἀριὼχ βασιλέα Ἐλλασάρ· οἱ τέσσαρες οὗτοι βασιλεῖς πρὸς τοὺς πέντε. Ἡ δὲ κοιλάς ἡ ἁλυκὴ, φρέατα ἀσφάλτου. Ἔφυγε δὲ βασιλεὺς Σοδόμων καὶ βασιλεὺς Γομόῤῥας, καὶ ἐνέπεσαν ἐκεῖ· οἱ δὲ καταλειφθέντες εἰς τὴν ὀρεινὴν ἔφυγον. Ἔλαβον δὲ τὴν ἵππον πᾶσαν τὴν Σοδόμων καὶ Γομόῤῥας, καὶ πάντα τὰ βρώματα αὐτῶν, καὶ ἀπῆλθον. Ἔλαβον δὲ καὶ τὸν Λὼτ υἱὸν τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ Ἄβραμ, καὶ τὴν ἀποσκευὴν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀπῴχοντο· ἦν γὰρ κατοικῶν ἐν Σοδόμοις. Παραγενόμενος δὲ τῶν ἀνασωθέντων τις, ἀπήγγειλεν Ἄβραμ τῷ περάτῃ· αὐτὸς δὲ κατῴκει ἐν τῇ δρυῒ τῇ Μαμβρῇ ὁ Ἀμορεῖς, τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ Ἐσχὼλ, καὶ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ Αὐνὰν, οἱ ἦσαν συνομώται τοῦ Ἄβραμ. Ἀκούσας δὲ Ἄβραμ ὅτι ἠχμαλωτεύθη Λὼτ ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ, ἠρίθμησε τοὺς ἰδίους οἰκογενεῖς αὐτοῦ τριακοσίους δέκα καὶ ὀκτὼ, καὶ κατεδίωξεν ὀπίσω αὐτῶν ἕως Δὰν· καὶ ἐπέπεσεν ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς τὴν νύκτα αὐτὸς, καὶ οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτοὺς, καὶ κατεδίωξεν αὐτοὺς ἕως Χοβάλ, ἥ ἐστιν ἐν ἀριστερᾷ Δαμασκοῦ· Καὶ ἀπέστρεψε πᾶσαν τὴν ἵππον Σοδόμων, καὶ Λὼτ τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ ἀπέστρεψε, καὶ πάντα τὰ ὑπάροχοντα αὐτοῦ,

**CHAPTER 14**

**2** Chedorlaomer, and Tidal king of nations, waged war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, and Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboim, and (with) Bela king (this is Zoar).
**3** All these gathered themselves together in the Salt Valley; (this is the Salt Sea).
**4** Twelve years had they served Chedorlaomer; and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
**5** And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him, and they smote the giants who were in Ashteroth Karnaim, and mighty nations with them,
**6** And the Emim who were in the city of Shaveh, and the Horites who were in the mount Seir, as far as the terebinth tree of Paran, which is in the wilderness.
**7** And turning back, they came unto the fountain of judgment (this is Kadesh); and they smote all the rulers of Amalek, and the Amorites that dwelt in Hazazon Tamar.
**8** Then went forth the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboim, and the king of Bela (this is Zoar),
**9** And they set themselves in battle array against them in the Salt Valley, against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; these four kings against the five.
**10** Now the Salt Valley had many bitumen pits. And the king of Sodom and the king of Gomorrah fled, and fell therein; but those who were left fled to the mountainous region.
**11** And they took all the horses of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their provisions, and departed.
**12** And they took also Lot, the son of Abram's brother, and his baggage, and went their way; for he dwelt in Sodom.
**13** And one of those who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt by the terebinth tree of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshkol, and brother of Aunan, who were confederates with Abram.
**14** And when Abram heard that Lot his brother was taken captive, he numbered his own household-born servants, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
**15** And he fell upon them by night, he and his servants, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
**16** And he brought back all the horses of Sodom, and Lot his brother he brought back, and all his possessions,
