ΚΕΦ. ΙΕ΄. XV.

ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο τὰ ὅρια φυλῆς υἱῶν Ἰούδα κατὰ δῆμους αὐτῶν 1
ἀπὸ τῶν ὁρίων τῆς Ἰδουμαίας, ἀπὸ τῆς ἐρήμου Σὶν ἕως Κάδης
πρὸς νότου. Καὶ ἐγενήθη αὐτῶν τὰ ὅρια ἀπὸ νότου ἕως μέρους 2
θαλάσσης τῆς ἁλυκῆς, ἀπὸ τῆς λωρίας τῆς φερούσης ἐπὶ νότον·
καὶ διαπορεύσεται ἀπέναντι τῆς προσαναβάσεως Ἀκραββεὶμ, καὶ 3
ἐκπεριπορεύσεται Σενά, καὶ ἀναβαίνει ἀπὸ νότου ἐπὶ Κάδης Βαρ-
νῆ· καὶ ἐκπορεύεται Ἑσρὼν, καὶ προσαναβαίνει εἰς Ἀδδαρὰ, καὶ
περιπορεύεται τὴν κατὰ δυσμὰς Κάδης· καὶ πορεύεται ἐπὶ Ἀσε- 4
μωνα, καὶ διεμβάλλει ἕως φάραγγος Αἰγύπτου, καὶ ἔσται αὐτοῦ
ἡ διέξοδος τῶν ὁρίων ἐπὶ τὴν θάλασσαν. Ταῦτά ἐστιν αὐτῶν τὰ
ὅρια ἀπὸ νότου. Καὶ τὰ ὅρια ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν, πᾶσα ἡ θάλασσα ἡ 5
ἁλυκὴ ἕως μέρους τοῦ Ἰορδάνου. Καὶ τὰ ὅρια αὐτῶν ἐπὶ βορρᾶν
καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς λωρίας τῆς θαλάσσης, καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ μέρους τοῦ Ἰορ-
δάνου ἐπιβαίνει τὰ ὅρια ἐπὶ Βαιθαγλὰ,
καὶ παραπορεύσεται ἀπὸ 6
βορρᾶ ἐπὶ Βαιθάραβα, καὶ προσαναβαίνει τὰ ὅρια ἐπὶ λίθον Βαιῶν
υἱοῦ Ῥουβήν· καὶ προσαναβαίνει τὰ ὅρια ἐπὶ τὸ τέταρτον τῆς 7
φάραγγος Ἀχὼρ, καὶ κατὰ βορρᾶν καταβαίνει ἐπὶ Γαλγαλὰ, ἡ
ἐστιν ἀπέναντι τῆς προσαναβάσεως Ἀδομμίμ, ἡ ἐστι κατὰ νότον
φάραγγι, καὶ διεμβάλλει τὸ ὅριον ἐπὶ τὸ ὕδωρ τῆς πηγῆς ἡλίου,
καὶ ἔσται αὐτοῦ ἡ διέξοδος πηγὴ Ῥωγήλ· καὶ ἀναβαίνει τὰ ὅρια 8
εἰς φάραγγα υἱοῦ Ἑννὸμ ἐπὶ νότου Ἰεβοὺς, (αὕτη ἐστὶν Ἱερου-
σαλήμ)· καὶ διεμβάλλει τὰ ὅρια ἐπὶ κορυφῆς ὄρους, ἡ ἐστι κατὰ
πρόσωπον φάραγγος Ἑννὸμ πρὸς θάλασσης, ἡ ἐστιν ἐκ μέρους γῆς
Ῥαφαεὶμ ἐπὶ βορρᾶν· καὶ διεμβάλλει τὸ ὅριον ἀπὸ κορυφῆς τοῦ 9
ὄρους ἐπὶ πηγὴν τοῦ ὕδατος Νεφθωὰ, καὶ διεμβάλλει ἐπὶ κώμας
ὄρους Ἑφρὼν, καὶ ἐξάξει τὸ ὅριον εἰς Βαὰλ, (αὕτη ἐστὶ πόλις
Ἰαρὶμ)· καὶ περιελεύσεται ὅριον ἀπὸ Βαὰλ ἐπὶ θάλασσαν εἰς ὄρος 10
Σηεὶρ, καὶ παρελεύσεται ἐπὶ νότου πόλιν Ἰαρὶμ ἀπὸ βορρᾶ, (αὕτη
ἐστὶ Χασαλὼν)· καὶ καταβήσεται ἐπὶ πόλιν ἡλίου, καὶ παρελεύσε-
ται ἐπὶ νότον· καὶ διεμβάλλει τὸ ὅριον κατὰ νότου Ἀκκαρὼν 11
ἐπὶ βορρᾶν, καὶ διεμβάλλει τὰ ὅρια εἰς Σακκαρῶνα, καὶ παρελεύ-
σεται ὄρος τῆς Βαλὰ, καὶ διεμβάλλει ἐπὶ Ἰαβνήλ· καὶ ἔσται ἡ διέ-
ξοδος τῶν ὁρίων ἐπὶ θάλασσαν. Καὶ τὰ ὅρια αὐτῶν ἀπὸ θαλάσσης, 12
