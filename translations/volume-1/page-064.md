μα τοῦ τόπου ἐκείνου, Οἶκος Θεοῦ· καὶ Οὐλαμλαοῦζ ἦν ὄνομα τῇ
πόλει τὸ πρότερον. Καὶ ἠύξατο Ἰακὼβ εὐχήν, λέγων· ἐὰν ᾖ Κύ- 20
ριος ὁ Θεὸς μετ᾽ ἐμοῦ, καὶ διαφυλάξῃ με ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ ταύτῃ, ᾗ
ἐγὼ πορεύομαι, καὶ δῷ μοι ἄρτον φαγεῖν, καὶ ἱμάτιον περιβαλέ-
σθαι, καὶ ἀποστρέψῃ με μετὰ σωτηρίας εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ πατρός 21
μου, καὶ ἔσται μοι Κύριος εἰς Θεόν· καὶ ὁ λίθος οὗτος, ὃν ἔστη- 22
σα στήλην, ἔσται μοι οἶκος Θεοῦ· καὶ πάντων ὧν ἐάν μοι δῷς,
δεκάτην ἀποδεκατώσω αὐτά σοι.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΘ΄. ΧΧΙΧ.

ΚΑΙ ἐξάρας Ἰακὼβ τοὺς πόδας, ἐπορεύθη εἰς γῆν ἀνατολῶν 1
πρὸς Λάβαν τὸν υἱὸν Βαθουὴλ τοῦ Σύρου, ἀδελφὸν δὲ Ῥεβέκκας
μητρὸς Ἰακὼβ καὶ Ἠσαῦ. Καὶ ὁρᾷ, καὶ ἰδοὺ φρέαρ ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ· 2
ἦσαν δὲ ἐκεῖ τρία ποίμνια προβάτων, ἀναπαυόμενα ἐπ᾽ αὐτοῦ, ἐκ
γὰρ τοῦ φρέατος ἐκείνου ἐπότιζον τὰ ποίμνια· λίθος δὲ ἦν μέγας
ἐπὶ τῷ στόματι τοῦ φρέατος. Καὶ συνήγοντο ἐκεῖ πάντα τὰ ποί- 3
μνια· καὶ ἀπεκύλιον τὸν λίθον ἀπὸ τοῦ στόματος τοῦ φρέατος,
καὶ ἐπότιζον τὰ πρόβατα· καὶ ἀπεκαθίστων τὸν λίθον ἐπὶ τὸ στό-
μα τοῦ φρέατος εἰς τὸν τόπον αὐτοῦ. Εἶπε δὲ αὐτοῖς Ἰακὼβ· ἀ- 4
δελφοί, πόθεν ἐστὲ ὑμεῖς; Οἱ δὲ εἶπαν· ἐκ Χαρρὰν ἐσμέν. Εἶπε 5
δὲ αὐτοῖς· γινώσκετε Λάβαν τὸν υἱὸν Ναχώρ; Οἱ δὲ εἶπαν· γι-
νώσκομεν. Εἶπε δὲ αὐτοῖς· ὑγιαίνει; Οἱ δὲ εἶπαν· ὑγιαίνει. (Ἔτι 6
αὐτοῦ λαλοῦντος,) καὶ ἰδοὺ Ῥαχὴλ ἡ θυγάτηρ αὐτοῦ ἤρχετο μετὰ
τῶν προβάτων (τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῆς· αὐτὴ γὰρ ἔβοσκε τὰ πρόβατα
τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῆς). Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰακὼβ· ἔτι ἐστὶν ἡμέρα πολλή, 7
οὔπω ὥρα συναχθῆναι τὰ κτήνη· ποτίσαντες τὰ πρόβατα, ἀπελ-
θόντες βόσκετε. Οἱ δὲ εἶπαν· οὐ δυνησόμεθα, ἕως τοῦ συναχθῆ- 8
ναι πάντας τοὺς ποιμένας, καὶ ἀποκυλίσωσι τὸν λίθον ἀπὸ τοῦ
στόματος τοῦ φρέατος, καὶ ποτίσωμεν τὰ πρόβατα. Ἔτι αὐτοῦ 9
λαλοῦντος αὐτοῖς, καὶ Ῥαχὴλ ἡ θυγάτηρ Λάβαν ἤρχετο μετὰ τῶν
προβάτων τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῆς· αὐτὴ γὰρ ἔβοσκε τὰ πρόβατα τοῦ
πατρὸς αὐτῆς. Ἐγένετο δὲ ὡς εἶδεν Ἰακὼβ τὴν Ῥαχήλ, θυγατέρα 10
Λάβαν ἀδελφοῦ τῆς μητρὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰ πρόβατα Λάβαν τοῦ ἀ-
δελφοῦ τῆς μητρὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ προσελθὼν Ἰακὼβ ἀπεκύλισε τὸν
λίθον ἀπὸ τοῦ στόματος τοῦ φρέατος, καὶ ἐπότισε τὰ πρόβατα

### CHAPTER XXVIII

Ma, of that place [was named] "House of God"; and Oulamlalous was the name of the city previously.
**20** And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, "If the Lord God be with me, and keep me in this way wherein I walk,
**21** and give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on; and bring me again in safety unto my father's house,
**22** then shall the Lord be my God; and this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's House unto me; and of all that Thou shalt give me, I will surely give the tenth thereof unto Thee."

### CHAPTER XXIX

**1** Then Jacob lifted up his feet, and journeyed into the land of the children of the East,
**2** unto Laban the son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.
**3** And he looked, and behold, a well in the field; and there were three flocks of sheep resting upon it; for from that well did they water the flocks. Now a great stone was upon the mouth of the well.
**4** And thither were all the flocks gathered; and they would roll the stone from the well's mouth, and water the sheep; then they would set the stone again upon the mouth of the well in its place.
**5** And Jacob said unto them, "Brethren, whence are ye?" And they said, "We are of Haran."
**6** Then he said unto them, "Know ye Laban the son of Nahor?" And they answered, "We know him."
**7** And he said unto them, "Is he well?" And they answered, "He is well." (While he yet spoke,)
**8** And behold, Rachel his daughter came with the sheep (of her father; for she kept her father's sheep).
**9** And Jacob said, "Lo, it is yet high day; neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together. Water ye the sheep, and go and feed them."
**10** And they said, "We cannot, until all the shepherds be gathered together, and they roll the stone from the mouth of the well, and we water the sheep."
**11** While he yet spoke with them, Rachel, Laban's daughter, came with her father's sheep; for she kept her father's sheep.
**12** And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of Laban, his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mother's brother,
**13** then Jacob drew near, and rolled the stone from the mouth of the well, and watered the sheep.
