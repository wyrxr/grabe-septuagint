Χαναναίῳ τῷ κατοικοῦντι ἐν τῇ γῇ Ἐμέκ, ἐν Βαιθσὰν καὶ ἐν ταῖς
17 κώμαις αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐν τῇ κοιλάδι Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰησοῦς τοῖς
υἱοῖς Ἰωσὴφ τῷ Ἐφραΐμ καὶ τῷ Μανασσὴ λέγων· εἰ λαὸς πο-
18 λὺς εἶ, καὶ ἰσχύν μεγάλην ἔχεις, οὐκ ἔσται σοι κλῆρος εἷς. Ὁ
γὰρ δρυμὸς ἔσται σοι, ὅτι δρυμός ἐστι, καὶ ἐκκαθαριεῖς αὐτόν, καὶ
ἔσται σοι ἡ ἐξοδία αὐτοῦ, (καὶ) ὅταν ἐξολοθρεύσῃς τὸν Χαναναῖον,
ὅτι ἵππος ἐπίλεκτος αὐτῷ· σὺ γὰρ ὑπερισχύσεις αὐτόν.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΗ΄. XVIII.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐξεκκλησιάσθη πᾶσα συναγωγὴ υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ εἰς Σηλώ,
2 καὶ ἔπηξαν ἐκεῖ τὴν σκηνὴν τοῦ μαρτυρίου· καὶ ἡ γῆ ἐκρατήθη
ὑπ’ αὐτῶν. Καὶ κατελείφθησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ, οἱ οὐ κατεκληρονόμη-
3 σαν τὴν κληρονομίαν αὑτῶν, ἑπτὰ φυλαί. Καὶ εἶπεν (αὐτοῖς) Ἰη-
σοῦς τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ· ἕως τίνος ὑμεῖς ἐκλυθήσεσθε εἰσελθεῖν,
κληρονομῆσαι τὴν γῆν; ἣν ἔδωκεν ὑμῖν Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τῶν πα-
4 τέρων ὑμῶν, δότε ἐξ ὑμῶν τρεῖς ἄνδρας ἐκ φυλῆς, καὶ ἀποστε-
λῶ αὐτοὺς, καὶ ἀναστάντες διελθάτωσαν τὴν γῆν, καὶ διαγραψά-
5 τωσαν αὐτὴν ἐναντίον ἐμοῦ, καθὰ δεήσει διελθεῖν αὐτήν. Καὶ ἦλ-
θον πρὸς αὐτόν· καὶ διείλεν αὐτοῖς ἑπτὰ μερίδας. Ἰούδας στήσε-
ται αὐτοῖς ὅριον ἀπὸ λιβὸς, καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰωσὴφ στήσονται ἐπὶ τὸ
6 ὅριον αὐτῶν ἀπὸ βορρᾶ· ὑμεῖς δὲ μερίσατε τὴν γῆν ἑπτὰ μερίδας,
καὶ ἐνέγκατε πρὸς με ὧδε, καὶ ἐξορίσω ὑμῖν κλῆρον ὧδε ἐναν-
7 τίον Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν. Οὐ γάρ ἐστι μερὶς τοῖς υἱοῖς Λευὶ
ἐν ὑμῖν, ὅτι ἡ ἱερατεία Κυρίου μερὶς αὐτοῦ· καὶ Γὰδ καὶ Ῥου-
βὴν καὶ τὸ ἥμισυ φυλῆς (υἱῶν) Μανασσὴ ἐλάβοσαν τὴν κληρονο-
μίαν αὑτῶν πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου ἐπ’ ἀνατολὰς, ἣν ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς
8 Μωυσῆς ὁ παῖς Κυρίου. Καὶ ἀναστάντες οἱ ἄνδρες ἐπορεύθησαν·
καὶ ἐνετείλατο Ἰησοῦς τοῖς ἀνδράσι τοῖς πορευομένοις χωροβατῆ-
σαι τὴν γῆν, λέγων· διέλθετε καὶ πορεύθητε καὶ χωροβατήσατε
τὴν γῆν, καὶ παραγενήθητε πρὸς με ὧδε, καὶ ἐξορίσω ὑμῖν κλῆ-
9 ρον ἔναντι Κυρίου ἐν Σηλώ. Καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν οἱ ἄνδρες, καὶ δι-
ῆλθον ἐν τῇ γῇ, καὶ ἐχωροβάτησαν τὴν γῆν, καὶ ἴδον αὐτὴν, καὶ
ἔγραψαν αὐτὴν κατὰ πόλεις αὐτῆς ἑπτὰ μερίδας εἰς βιβλίον· καὶ
10 ἤνεγκαν πρὸς Ἰησοῦν εἰς τὴν παρεμβολὴν εἰς Σηλώ. Καὶ ἐνέβα-
λεν αὐτοῖς Ἰησοῦς κλῆρον ἐν Σηλὼ ἔναντίον Κυρίου· καὶ ἐμέρι-

**Joshua 17**

<sup>16</sup> unto all the Canaanite, who doth dwell in the land of Emek, in Beth-shan and in her villages, and in the valley of Israel.
<sup>17</sup> And Joshua said unto the children of Joseph, [unto] Ephraim and [unto] Manasseh, saying: "If thou art a numerous people, and dost possess great strength, then shall there not be one lot for thee.
<sup>18</sup> For the woodland shall be thine, for it is woodland, and thou shalt clear it; and the full measure thereof shall be thine, (and) when thou shalt utterly dispossess the Canaanite, though he have choice horse[s]; for thou shalt surely prevail over him."

**Joshua 18**

<sup>1</sup> And the whole congregation of the children of Israel was assembled at Shiloh, and they set up there the tabernacle of testimony; and the land was then subdued by them.
<sup>2</sup> And there remained of the children of Israel, those who had not received their inheritance, even seven tribes.
<sup>3</sup> And Joshua spake (unto them) to the children of Israel, saying: "How long will ye be slack to go in and to inherit the land which the Lord God of your fathers hath given unto you?
<sup>4</sup> Give ye from among yourselves three men [from each] tribe, and I will send them, that they may arise and walk through the land, and describe it before me, even as it shall be necessary to traverse it.
<sup>5</sup> And they came unto him; and he divided unto them seven portions. Judah shall stand for them a border from the south, and the children of Joseph shall stand upon their border from the north.
<sup>6</sup> But ye, divide the land into seven portions, and bring [the description thereof] unto me here, and I will cast lots for you here before the Lord our God.
<sup>7</sup> For there is no portion for the sons of Levi among you, because the priesthood of the Lord is their portion; and Gad and Reuben and the half tribe (of the children) of Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan eastward, which Moses the servant of the Lord did give unto them."
<sup>8</sup> And the men arose and departed; and Joshua commanded the men who were going to survey the land, saying: "Go ye through and walk, and survey the land, and return ye unto me here, and I will cast lots for you before the Lord in Shiloh."
<sup>9</sup> And the men departed, and they went through the land, and they surveyed the land, and they saw it; and they described it by its cities into seven portions in a book; and they brought [the same] unto Joshua, to the camp in Shiloh.
<sup>10</sup> And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh, before the Lord; and he did divide...
