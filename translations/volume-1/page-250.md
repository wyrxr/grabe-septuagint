14 And the Lord spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,
15 "Number the sons of Levi by the houses of their fathers, according to their clans,
16 by their families, every male from a month old and upward; them shall ye number."
17 So Moses and Aaron numbered them at the command of the Lord, as the Lord had commanded them.
18 And these shall be the sons of Levi by their names: Gershon, Kohath, and
19 Merari. And these are the names of the sons of Gershon, according to their clans:
20 Libni and Shimei. And the sons of Kohath by their clans:
21 Amram and Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. And (these are) the sons of Merari,
22 by their clans: Mahli and Mushi. These are the clans of the
23 Levites, according to the houses of their fathers. To Gershon belonged the clan of
24 the Libnites, and the clan of the Shimeites; these are the clans of Gershon.
25 The numbering of them, according to the number of every male from a month old
26 and upward, their number was seven thousand and five hundred.
27 And these clans of Gershon shall encamp behind the tabernacle, toward the west;
28 and the chief of the house of the father's clan of Gershon was Elisaph,
29 the son of Lael. And the charge of the sons of Gershon, concerning the tabernacle of the
30 testimony, was the tabernacle itself, and the tent, and the covering thereof, and the
31 screen for the door of the tabernacle of the testimony, and the hangings
32 of the court, and the screen for the gate of the court, which is
33 upon the tabernacle, and upon the altar round about, and the remnants
34 of all its service. To Kohath belonged the clan of the Amramites,
35 and the clan of the Izharites, and the clan of the Hebronites, and the clan
36 of the Uzzielites; these are the clans of Kohath. According to the number of every male,
37 from a month old and upward, were eight thousand and six hundred, keeping
38 the charge of the holy things. The clans of the sons of Kohath
39 shall encamp on the side of the tabernacle toward the south; and the chief
40 of the house of the fathers of the clans of Kohath was Elizaphan, the son of Uzziel.
41 And their charge was the ark, and the table, and the lampstand, and the
42 altars, and the vessels of the sanctuary, wherewith they minister therein,
43 and the veil, and all their service.
44 And the chief over the chiefs of the Levites was Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest,
45 appointed to keep the charge of the sanctuary. To Merari belonged the clan of
46 the Mahlites, and the clan of the Mushites; these are the clans of Merari.
47 The numbering of them, according to the number of every male from a month old
48 and upward, was six thousand two hundred and fifty.
