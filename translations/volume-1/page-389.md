ΚΕΦ. ΛΔ´. XXXIV.

ὑπερασπιεῖ ὁ βοηθός σου, καὶ ἡ μάχαιρα καύχημά σου· καὶ ψεύ-
σονται σε οἱ ἐχθροί σου, καὶ σὺ ἐπὶ τὸν τράχηλον αὐτῶν ἐπιβήσῃ.

ΚΕΦ. ΛΔ´. XXXIV.

1 ΚΑΙ ἀνέβη Μωυσῆς ἀπὸ Ἀραβὼθ Μωὰβ ἐπὶ τὸ ὄρος Ναβῦ,
ἐπὶ κορυφὴν Φασγά, ἡ ἐστιν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον Ἰεριχώ· καὶ ἔδειξεν
2 αὐτῷ Κύριος πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν Γαλαὰδ ἕως Δὰν, καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν
γῆν Νεφθαλείμ, καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν Ἐφραίμ, καὶ Μανασσῆ, καὶ
3 πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν Ἰούδα ἕως τῆς θαλάσσης τῆς ἐσχάτης, καὶ τὴν
ἔρημον, καὶ τὰ περίχωρα Ἰεριχώ, πόλιν Φοινίκων ἕως Σηγώρ.
4 Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν· αὕτη ἡ γῆ ἣν ὤμοσα Ἀβραὰμ
καὶ Ἰσαὰκ καὶ Ἰακὼβ, λέγων· τῷ σπέρματι ὑμῶν δώσω αὐτήν.
5 Ἔδειξα αὐτὴν τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς σου, καὶ ἐκεῖ οὐκ εἰσελεύσῃ. Καὶ
ἐτελεύτησεν ἐκεῖ Μωυσῆς, οἰκέτης Κυρίου, ἐν γῇ Μωὰβ διὰ ῥή-
6 ματος Κυρίου· καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν ἐν Γαῖ ἐν γῇ Μωὰβ ἐγγὺς οἴκου
Φογώρ· καὶ οὐκ οἶδεν οὐδεὶς τὴν ταφὴν αὐτοῦ ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας
7 ταύτης. Μωυσῆς δὲ ἦν ἑκατὸν καὶ εἴκοσι ἐτῶν ἐν τῷ τελευτῆσαι
αὐτόν· οὐκ ἠμαυρώθησαν οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτοῦ, οὐδὲ ἐφθάρη τὰ χείλυνια
8 αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἔκλαυσαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ τὸν Μωυσῆν ἐν Ἀρα-
βὼθ Μωὰβ ἐπὶ τοῦ Ἰορδάνου κατὰ Ἰεριχὼ τριάκοντα ἡμέρας· καὶ
9 συνετελέσθησαν αἱ ἡμέραι πένθους κλαυθμοῦ Μωυσῆ. Καὶ Ἰησοῦς
υἱὸς Ναυῆ ἐνεπλήσθη πνεύματος συνέσεως· ἐπέθηκε γάρ Μωυσῆς
τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ ἐπ᾿ αὐτόν· καὶ εἰσήκουσαν αὐτοῦ οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ,
10 καὶ ἐποίησαν καθότι ἐνετείλατο Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ. Καὶ οὐκ ἀνέ-
στη ἔτι προφήτης ἐν Ἰσραὴλ ὡς Μωυσῆς, ὃν ἔγνω Κύριος αὐτὸν
11 πρόσωπον κατὰ πρόσωπον, ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς σημείοις καὶ τέρασιν, ἐν
ἀπέστειλεν αὐτὸν Κύριος ποιῆσαι αὐτὰ ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ Φαραὼ
12 καὶ τοῖς θεράπουσιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάσῃ τῇ γῇ αὐτοῦ· καὶ τὰ θαυ-
μάσια τὰ μεγάλα καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν χεῖρα τὴν κραταιὰν, ἃ ἐποίησε
Μωυσῆς ἔναντι παντὸς Ἰσραήλ.

**Deuteronomy 33**
29 Thy Helper shall shield thee, and thy sword [shall be] thy boast. And thy foes shall feign submission unto thee, and thou shalt tread upon their necks.

**Deuteronomy 34**

1 And Moses ascended from Arboth Moab unto Mount Nebo, to the peak of Pisgah, which faceth Jericho.
2 And the Lord showed him all the land of Gilead, even unto Dan; and all the land of Naphtali, and all the land of Ephraim and Manasseh;
3 And all the land of Judah, even unto the Western Sea; and the desert, and the environs of Jericho, the city of palms, even unto Zoar.
4 And the Lord said unto Moses, "This is the land which I swore unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, 'Unto your seed will I give it.'
5 I have caused thine eyes to behold it, but thither shalt thou not enter." And Moses, the servant of the Lord, died there in the land of Moab, by the word of the Lord.
6 And they buried him in Gai in the land of Moab, nigh unto Beth-Peor; but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.
7 Now Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eyes were not dimmed, nor his vitality consumed.
8 And the sons of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab, by the Jordan, over against Jericho, for thirty days; and the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were accomplished.
9 And Joshua the son of Nun was filled with the spirit of understanding; for Moses had laid his hands upon him. And the sons of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the Lord had commanded Moses.
10 And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face,
11 In all the signs and wonders, [in which] the Lord sent him to perform them in the land of Egypt, unto Pharaoh,
12 And unto his servants, and unto all his land; and all the great wonders, and all the mighty hand, which Moses performed before all Israel.
