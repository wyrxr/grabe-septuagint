ΚΕΦ. ΙΔʹ. ΚΡΙΤΑΙ 455
οὐδὲ τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ, ἃ ἐποίησε. Καὶ κατέβησαν, καὶ ἐλάλησαν τῇ 7
γυναικί, καὶ ἤρεσεν ἐνώπιον Σαμψών. Καὶ ἐπέστρεψε μεθ᾿ ἡμέ- 8
ρας, λαβεῖν αὐτήν, καὶ ἐξέκλινεν ἰδεῖν τὸ πτῶμα τοῦ λέοντος, καὶ
ἰδοῦ συστροφὴ μελισσῶν ἐν τῷ σώματι τοῦ λέοντος καὶ μέλι ἦν.
Καὶ ἐξεῖλεν αὐτὸ εἰς τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπορεύθη, πορευόμενος 9
καὶ ἐσθίων καὶ ἐπορεύθη πρὸς τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ καὶ πρὸς τὴν
μητέρα αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἔφαγον· καὶ οὐκ ἀπήγ-
γειλεν αὐτοῖς ὅτι ἐκ τῆς ἐξέως τοῦ λέοντος ἐξεῖλε τὸ μέλι. Καὶ 10
κατέβη ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ πρὸς τὴν γυναῖκα, καὶ ἐποίησεν ἐκεῖ Σαμ-
ψὼν πότον ἡμέρας ἑπτά, ὅτι οὕτως ἐποίουν οἱ νεανίσκοι. Καὶ ἐγέ- 11
νετο ἐν τῷ φοβεῖσθαι αὐτοὺς αὐτόν, προσκατέστησαν αὐτῷ ἑτέρους
τριάκοντα, καὶ ἦσαν μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς Σαμψών· προ- 12
βαλῶ δὴ ὑμῖν πρόβλημα, καὶ ἐὰν ἀπαγγέλλοντες ἀπαγγείλητέ μοι
τὸ πρόβλημα ἐν ταῖς ἑπτὰ ἡμέραις τοῦ πότου, καὶ εὕρητε, δώ-
σω ὑμῖν τριάκοντα σινδόνας καὶ τριάκοντα στολὰς ἱματίων· καὶ ἐὰν 13
μὴ δυνάσθητε ἀπαγγεῖλαί μοι, καὶ δώσετε ὑμεῖς ἐμοὶ τριάκοντα
σινδόνας καὶ τριάκοντα στολὰς ἱματίων. Καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῷ· προβά-
λου τὸ πρόβλημά σου, καὶ ἀκουσόμεθα αὐτό. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· 14
ἐκ τοῦ ἐσθίοντος ἐξῆλθε βρῶσις, καὶ ἐξ ἰσχυροῦ ἐξῆλθε γλυκύ·
Καὶ οὐκ ἠδυνάσθησαν ἀπαγγεῖλαι ἐπὶ τρεῖς ἡμέρας τὸ πρόβλημα.
Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τετάρτῃ, καὶ εἶπαν τῇ γυναικὶ Σαμ- 15
ψών· ἀπάτησον δὴ τὸν ἄνδρα σου, καὶ ἀπαγγειλάτω σοι τὸ πρό-
βλημα, μήποτε ἐμπυρίσωμέν σε καὶ τὸν οἶκον τοῦ πατρός σου ἐν
πυρί· ἢ πτωχεῦσαι ἐκαλέσατε ἡμᾶς; Καὶ ἔκλαυσεν ἡ γυνὴ Σαμ- 16
ψών πρὸς αὐτόν, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· μεμίσηκάς με, καὶ οὐκ ἠγάπη-
κας με, ὅτι τὸ πρόβλημα ὃ προεβάλου τοῖς υἱοῖς τοῦ λαοῦ μου,
κἀμοὶ οὐκ ἀπήγγειλας αὐτό. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ Σαμψών· ἰδοὺ τῷ
πατρί μου καὶ τῇ μητρί μου οὐκ ἀπήγγειλα αὐτό, καὶ σοι ἀπηγ-
γελῶ; Καὶ ἔκλαυσεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὰς ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας, ἐν αἷς ἦν 17
αὐταῖς ὁ πότος· καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ, καὶ ἀπήγ-
γειλεν αὐτῇ, ὅτι παρηνώχλησεν αὐτόν· καὶ αὕτη ἀπήγγειλε τὸ
πρόβλημα τοῖς υἱοῖς τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτῆς. Καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῷ οἱ ἄνδρες 18
τῆς πόλεως τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ, πρὶν δῦναι τὸν ἥλιον· τί γλυκύ-
τερον μέλιτος, καὶ τί ἰσχυρότερον λέοντος; Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς Σαμ-
ψών· εἰ μὴ κατεδαμάσατέ μου τὴν δάμαλιν, οὐκ ἂν εὕρητε τὸ
πρόβλημά μου. Καὶ κατεύθυνεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν πνεῦμα Κυρίου, καὶ κα- 19

### Judges Chapter 14

**7.** nor yet to his mother, what he had done. And they went down, and spake with the woman, and she was pleasing in the sight of Samson.

**8.** And he returned after a time, to take her; and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey therein.

**9.** And he took [some of] it, and put it into his mouth, and went on, eating as he went; and he went unto his father and unto his mother, and gave [some of it] unto them, and they did eat: but he told them not that he had taken the honey out of the carcass of the lion.

**10.** So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a feast [for] seven days; for so used the young men to do.

**11.** And it came to pass, when they were afraid of him, that they appointed thirty [men] to be his companions; and these were with him.

**12.** And Samson said unto them, "I will now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can certainly declare it unto me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty changes of raiment.

**13.** But if ye cannot declare it unto me, then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty changes of raiment."

**14.** And they said unto him, "Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it." And he said unto them,
"Out of the eater came forth meat,
And out of the strong came forth sweetness."
And they could not in three days declare the riddle.

**15.** And it came to pass on the fourth day, that they said unto Samson's wife, "Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire. Have ye called us to impoverish us?"

**16.** And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, "Thou dost hate me, and lovest me not; for thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not told it me." And Samson said unto her, "Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I then tell it thee?"

**17.** And she wept upon him the seven days, during which the feast did last: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told it her, because she pressed him sore. And she declared the riddle unto the children of her people.

**18.** And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day, before the sun went down, "What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion?" And Samson said unto them, "If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle."

**19.** And the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their changes of raiment, and gave [them] unto them which declared the riddle.
