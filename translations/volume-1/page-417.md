ΚΕΦ. ΙΔʹ.
τοῦ πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου· καὶ τοῖς Λευίταις οὐκ ἔδωκε κλῆρον ἐν
4 αὐτοῖς, ὅτι ἦσαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰωσὴφ δύο φυλαί, Μανασσῆ καὶ Ἐφραίμ·
  καὶ οὐκ ἐδόθη μερὶς ἐν τῇ γῇ τοῖς Λευίταις, ἀλλ᾽ ἢ πόλεις κα-
  τοικεῖν, καὶ τὰ ἀφωρισμένα αὐτῶν τοῖς κτήνεσιν αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰ
5 κτήνη αὐτῶν. Ὃν τρόπον ἐνετείλατο Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ, οὕτως
6 ἐποίησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐμερίσαντο τὴν γῆν. Καὶ προσῆλ-
  θον οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰούδα πρὸς Ἰησοῦν ἐν Γαλγάλοις· καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐ-
  τὸν Χάλεβ ὁ τοῦ Ἰεφοννῆ ὁ Κενεζαῖος· σὺ ἐπίστῃ τὸ ῥῆμα ὃ
  ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν ἄνθρωπον τοῦ Θεοῦ περὶ ἐμοῦ καὶ
7 σοῦ ἐν Κάδης Βαρνῆ. Τεσσαράκοντα γὰρ ἐτῶν ἤμην, ὅτε ἀπέστει-
  λέ με Μωυσῆς δοῦλος Κυρίου ἐκ Κάδης Βαρνῆ, κατασκοπεῦσαι
8 τὴν γῆν· καὶ ἀπεκρίθη αὐτῷ λόγον κατὰ τὸν νοῦν αὐτοῦ. Οἱ δὲ
  ἀδελφοί μου οἱ συναναβάντες μετ᾽ ἐμοῦ, μετέστησαν τὴν διάνοιαν
  τοῦ λαοῦ· ἐγὼ δὲ προσετέθην ἐπακολουθῆσαι Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ μου.
9 Καὶ ὤμοσε Μωυσῆς ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ, λέγων· ἔτι ἡ γῆ ἐφ᾽ ἧς
  ἐπέβης ἐν αὐτῇ, σοὶ ἔσται ἐν κλήρῳ καὶ τοῖς τέκνοις σου εἰς τὸν
  αἰῶνα, ὅτι προσετέθην ἐπακολουθῆσαι ὀπίσω Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ μου.
10 Καὶ νῦν ἰδοὺ διέθρεψέ με Κύριος, ὃν τρόπον εἶπε, τοῦτο τεσσα-
   ρακοστὸν καὶ πέμπτον ἔτος, ἀφ᾽ οὗ ἐλάλησε Κύριος τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦ-
   το πρὸς Μωυσῆν, καὶ ἐπορεύθη Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ· καὶ νῦν
11 ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ σήμερον υἱὸς ὀγδοήκοντα καὶ πέντε ἐτῶν ἔτι εἰμὶ σή-
   μερον ἰσχύων ὡσεὶ ὅτε ἀπέστειλέ με Μωυσῆς· ὡσαύτως ἰσχύω
12 νῦν ἐξελθεῖν καὶ εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὸν πόλεμον. Καὶ νῦν αἰτοῦμαί σε
   τὸ ὄρος τοῦτο, καθὰ εἶπε Κύριος ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ· ὅτι σὺ ἀ-
   κήκοας τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ. Νυνὶ δὲ εἰ Ἐνακὶμ
   ἐκεῖ εἰσί, πόλεις ὀχυραὶ καὶ μεγάλαι· ἐὰν οὖν Κύριος μετ᾽ ἐμοῦ
13 ᾖ, ἐξολοθρεύσω αὐτούς, ὃν τρόπον εἶπέ μοι Κύριος. Καὶ εὐλόγη-
   σεν αὐτὸν Ἰησοῦς, καὶ ἔδωκε τὴν Χεβρὼν τῷ Χάλεβ υἱῷ Ἰεφον-
14 νῆ, τῷ Κενεζαίῳ ἐν κλήρῳ· διὰ τοῦτο ἐγενήθη Χεβρὼν τῷ Χά-
   λεβ τῷ τοῦ Ἰεφοννῆ τοῦ Κενεζαίου ἐν κλήρῳ ἕως τῆς σήμερον
   ἡμέρας, διὰ τὸ αὐτὸν ἐπακολουθῆσαι τῷ προστάγματι Κυρίου τοῦ
15 Θεοῦ Ἰσραήλ. Τὸ δὲ ὄνομα Χεβρὼν τὸ πρότερον πόλις Ἀρβό μητρόπολις τῶν Ἐνακὶμ αὕτη. Καὶ ἡ γῆ ἐκόπασε τοῦ πολέμου.

**Joshua 14** (continued)

<sup>3</sup> the other side of the Jordan; and unto the Levites gave He no inheritance among
<sup>4</sup> them; for the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim; and no portion in the land was given unto the Levites, but only cities to dwell in, and their appointed pasturelands for their cattle, and their very livestock.
<sup>5</sup> As the LORD had commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel, and they divided the land.
<sup>6</sup> And the children of Judah drew nigh unto Joshua in Gilgal; and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said unto him, "Thou knowest the word which the LORD spake unto Moses, the man of God, concerning me and thee in
<sup>7</sup> Kadesh-barnea. For forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the
<sup>8</sup> land; and I brought him word again according to my [best] judgment. But my brethren that went up with me caused the heart of the people to melt; yet I wholly followed the LORD my God.
<sup>9</sup> And Moses sware on that day, saying, 'Surely the land whereon thy foot hath trodden shall be thine inheritance, and thy children's, for ever, because thou hast wholly followed the LORD my God.'
<sup>10</sup> And now, behold, the LORD hath preserved me alive, as He said, these forty and five years, even since the LORD spake this word unto Moses, whilst Israel wandered in the wilderness; and now,
<sup>11</sup> behold, I am this day eighty and five years old. As yet am I strong this day, as I was in the day that Moses sent me; even as my strength was then, so is my strength
<sup>12</sup> now to go out and to come in to war. Now therefore, I pray thee, give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spake in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakim were there, and that the cities were great and fenced: if so be the LORD will be with me,
<sup>13</sup> then I shall drive them out, as the LORD said unto me." And Joshua blessed him, and gave Hebron unto Caleb the son of
<sup>14</sup> Jephunneh, the Kenizzite, for an inheritance. Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite unto this day, because he wholly followed the precept of the LORD God of Israel.
<sup>15</sup> Now the name of Hebron before was the city of Arbo; this [city] was the metropolis of the Anakim. And the land had rest from war.
