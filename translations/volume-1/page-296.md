3 Καὶ ἀναλαβὼν τὴν παραβολὴν αὑτοῦ, εἶπε· φησὶ Βαλαὰμ υἱὸς Βεὼρ,
4 φησὶν ὁ ἄνθρωπος ὁ ἀληθινῶς ὁρῶν, φησὶν ἀκούων λόγια (Θεοῦ)
ἰσχυροῦ, ὅστις ὅρασιν Θεοῦ εἶδεν ἐν ὕπνῳ, ἀποκεκαλυμμένοι οἱ ὀφ-
θαλμοὶ αὑτοῦ
5 ὡς καλοὶ οἶκοί σου Ἰακὼβ, αἱ σκηναί σου Ἰσραήλ·
ὡσεὶ νάπαι σκιάζουσαι, καὶ ὡσεὶ παράδεισοι ἐπὶ ποταμῷ, καὶ ὡσεὶ
σκηναὶ, ἃς ἔπηξε Κύριος, ὡσεὶ κέδροι παρ’ ὕδατα.
7 Ἐξελεύσεται ἄνθρωπος ἐκ τοῦ σπέρματος αὑτοῦ, καὶ κυριεύσει ἐθνῶν πολλῶν·
καὶ ὑψωθήσεται ἡ Γὼγ βασιλεία αὑτοῦ, καὶ αὐξηθήσεται ἡ βασιλεία
αὑτοῦ.
8 Ὁ Θεὸς ὡδήγησεν αὑτὸν ἐξ Αἰγύπτου, ὡς δόξα μονοκέρωτος αὑτῷ·
ἔδεται ἔθνη ἐχθρῶν αὑτοῦ, καὶ τὰ πάχη αὑτῶν ἐκμυελιεῖ, καὶ ταῖς
βολίσιν αὑτοῦ κατατοξεύσει ἐχθρόν.
9 Κατακλιθεὶς ἀνεπαύσατο ὡς λέων, καὶ ὡς σκύμνος· τίς ἀναστήσει αὑτόν;
οἱ εὐλογοῦντές σε, ηὐλόγηνται, καὶ οἱ καταρώμενοί σε, κεκατήρανται.
10 Καὶ ἐθυμώθη ὀργὴ Βαλὰκ ἐπὶ Βαλαὰμ, καὶ συνεκρότησε ταῖς χερσὶν
αὑτοῦ, καὶ εἶπε Βαλὰκ πρὸς Βαλαάμ· καταράσασθαι τὸν ἐχθρόν μου
κέκληκά σε, καὶ ἰδοὺ εὐλογῶν εὐλόγησας τοῦτο τρίτον.
11 Νῦν οὖν φεῦγε εἰς τὸν τόπον σου· εἶπα, τιμήσω σε· καὶ νῦν ἐστέρησέ
σε Κύριος τῆς δόξης.
12 Καὶ εἶπε Βαλαὰμ πρὸς Βαλάκ· οὐχὶ καὶ τοῖς ἀγγέλοις σου, οἷς ἀπέστειλας
πρὸς με, ἐλάλησα;
13 λέγων· ἐάν μοι δῷ Βαλὰκ πλήρη τὸν οἶκον αὑτοῦ ἀργυρίου καὶ χρυσίου,
οὐ δυνήσομαι παραβῆναι τὸ ῥῆμα Κυρίου, ποιῆσαι αὐτὸ καλὸν ἢ
πονηρὸν παρ’ ἐμαυτοῦ· ὅσα ἐὰν εἴπῃ μοι ὁ Θεὸς, ταῦτα ἐρῶ.
14 Καὶ νῦν ἰδοὺ ἀποτρέχω εἰς τὸν τόπον μου· δεῦρο, συμβουλεύσω σοι,
τί ποιήσει ὁ λαὸς οὗτος τὸν λαόν σου ἐπ’ ἐσχάτου τῶν ἡμερῶν.
15 Καὶ ἀναλαβὼν τὴν παραβολὴν αὑτοῦ, εἶπε· φησὶ Βαλαὰμ υἱὸς Βεὼρ,
φησὶν ὁ ἄνθρωπος ὁ ἀληθινῶς ὁρῶν,
16 φησὶν ἀκούων λόγια Θεοῦ, ἐπιστάμενος ἐπιστήμην ὑψίστου, καὶ ὅρασιν
Θεοῦ ἰδὼν ἐν ὕπνῳ, ἀποκεκαλυμμένοι οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὑτοῦ·
17 δείξω αὑτῷ, καὶ οὐχὶ νῦν· μακαρίζω, καὶ οὐκ ἐγγίζει.
Ἀνατελεῖ ἄστρον ἐξ Ἰακὼβ, καὶ ἀναστήσεται ἄνθρωπος ἐξ Ἰσραήλ,
καὶ θραύσει τοὺς ἀρχηγοὺς Μωὰβ, καὶ προνομεύσει πάντας τοὺς
υἱοὺς Σήθ·
18 καὶ ἔσται Ἐδὼμ κληρονομία, καὶ ἔσται κληρονομία Ἡσαῦ ὁ ἐχθρὸς
αὑτοῦ, καὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐποίησεν ἐν ἰσχύϊ·
19 καὶ ἐξεγερθήσεται ἐξ Ἰακὼβ, καὶ ἀπολεῖ σῳζόμενον ἐκ πόλεως.
20 Καὶ ἰδὼν τὸν Ἀμαλὴκ, καὶ ἀναλαβὼν τὴν παραβολὴν αὑτοῦ, εἶπεν·
ἀρχὴ ἐθνῶν Ἀμαλὴκ, καὶ τὸ σπέρμα αὑτοῦ ἀπολεῖται.
21 Καὶ ἰδὼν τὸν Κεναῖον, καὶ ἀναλαβὼν τὴν

### English Translation

**NUMBERS, CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR**

3 And Balaam took up his parable, and said,
“Balaam the son of Beor saith,
4 He saith, the man who truly sees;
He saith, he who hears the words of [the] mighty God,
who saw a vision of God in a sleep,
[with] his eyes uncovered:
5 How goodly are thy dwellings, O Jacob,
and thy tents, O Israel!
As shady glades, and as gardens by a river,
and as the tents which the Lord hath pitched,
as cedars beside waters.
7 There shall come forth a man from his seed,
and he shall rule over many nations;
and the kingdom of Gog shall be exalted,
and his kingdom shall be increased.
8 God led him forth from Egypt;
as the glory of a unicorn is his;
he shall devour the nations, his enemies,
and shall suck out their fat,
and with his darts shall he shoot down the enemy.
9 He crouched down, he rested as a lion,
and as a lion’s whelp; who shall rouse him up?
They that bless thee are blessed,
and they that curse thee are cursed.”
10 And the wrath of Balak waxed hot against Balaam, and he clapped his hands together; and Balak said unto Balaam, “To curse mine enemy have I called thee, and behold, thou hast blessed them now these three times.
11 Now therefore, flee unto thy place. I said, 'I will surely honor thee;' but now the Lord hath deprived thee of glory.”
12 And Balaam said unto Balak, “Did I not speak even unto thy messengers whom thou didst send unto me?
13 saying, 'If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord, to do it either good or evil of mine own accord; whatsoever the Lord shall say unto me, that will I speak.'
14 And now, behold, I return unto my place. Come now, I will advise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days.”
15 And he took up his parable, and said,
“Balaam the son of Beor saith,
He saith, the man who truly sees;
16 He saith, he who hears the words of God,
knowing the knowledge of the Most High,
and having seen a vision of God in a sleep,
[with] his eyes uncovered:
17 I shall show to him, but not now;
I bless, but he draws not nigh.
A star shall rise out of Jacob,
and a man shall rise out of Israel,
and he shall crush the rulers of Moab,
and shall lay waste all the sons of Seth.
18 And Edom shall be an inheritance,
and Esau, his enemy, shall be an inheritance,
and Israel shall act with might.
19 And one shall arise out of Jacob,
and shall destroy those who are saved from the city.”
20 And he looked on Amalek, and took up his parable, and said,
“Amalek is the beginning of nations,
and his seed shall perish utterly.”
21 And he looked on the Kenite, and took up his parable,
