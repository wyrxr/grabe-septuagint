    1 ΚΑΙ ταῦτά ἐστιν, ἃ ποιήσεις αὐτοῖς, ἁγιάσαι αὐτούς, ὥστε
    ἱερατεύειν μοι αὐτούς· λήψῃ μοσχάριον ἐκ βοῶν (ἄμωμον) ἕν, καὶ

    καὶ λάγανα ἄζυμα κεχρισμένα ἐν ἐλαίῳ, σεμίδαλιν ἐκ πυρῶν ποιή-

    ρὼν καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ προσάξεις ἐπὶ τὰς θύρας τῆς σκηνῆς

    λὰς, ἐνδύσεις (αὐτὰ) Ἀαρὼν τὸν ἀδελφόν σου, καὶ τὸν χιτῶνα
    τὸν ποδήρη τοῦ ἐπενδύματος, καὶ τὴν ἐπωμίδα, καὶ τὸ λογεῖον,
    6 καὶ συνάψεις αὐτῷ τὸ λογεῖον πρὸς τὴν ἐπωμίδα· καὶ ἐπιθήσεις
    τὴν μίτραν ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπιθήσεις τὸ πέταλον τὸ
    7 ἁγίασμα ἐπὶ τὴν μίτραν. Καὶ λήψῃ τοῦ ἐλαίου τοῦ χρίσματος,
    8 καὶ ἐπιχεεῖς αὐτὸ ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ, καὶ χρίσεις αὐτόν. Καὶ
    τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ προσάξεις, καὶ ἐνδύσεις αὐτοὺς χιτῶνας, καὶ
    9 ζώσεις αὐτοὺς ταῖς ζώναις, καὶ περιθήσεις αὐτοῖς τὰς κιδάρεῖς,
    καὶ ἔσται αὐτοῖς ἱερατεία ἐμοί εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα· καὶ τελειώσεις τὰς
    10 χεῖρας Ἀαρὼν, καὶ τὰς χεῖρας τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ προσάξεις
    τὸν μόσχον ἐπὶ τὰς θύρας τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου, καὶ ἐπιθή-

    λοβὸν ἐπὶ τοῦ ἥπατος, καὶ τοὺς δύο νεφροὺς, καὶ τὸ στέαρ τὸ

    μόσχου, καὶ τὸ δέρμα, καὶ τὴν κόπρον αὐτοῦ κατακαύσεις πυρὶ

    …when they shall enter into the Tent of Witness, or when they draw nigh to minister before the holy Altar, they shall not bring upon themselves guilt, lest they die. This shall be a perpetual ordinance for him and for his seed after him.

    ### Chapter 29

    1.  NOW THESE are the things which thou shalt do unto them to consecrate them, that they may minister unto Me in the priest's office. Thou shalt take one young bullock from the herd, (a blemishless one),
    2.  and two rams without blemish; and unleavened loaves, kneaded with oil, and unleavened wafers, anointed with oil. Of fine flour of wheat shalt thou make them.
    3.  And thou shalt put them in one basket, and shalt bring them in the basket, with the young bullock and the two rams.
    4.  And Aaron and his sons shalt thou bring unto the door of the Tent of Witness,
    5.  and shalt wash them with water. And thou shalt take the vestments, and shalt clothe therewith Aaron thy brother: [even] the tunic, the long robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate.
    6.  And thou shalt fasten the breastplate to him with the ephod. And thou shalt set the mitre upon his head, and shalt put the holy plate upon the mitre.
    7.  Then shalt thou take the oil of anointing,
    8.  and shalt pour it upon his head, and anoint him. And thou shalt bring his sons, and shalt clothe them with tunics,
    9.  and shalt gird them with girdles, and shalt bind the turbans upon them. And the priesthood shall be theirs unto Me for an everlasting ordinance. And thou shalt consecrate the hands of Aaron and the hands of his sons.
    10. And thou shalt bring the bullock unto the door of the Tent of Witness; and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock.
    11. And thou shalt slaughter the bullock before the Lord, beside the doors of the Tent of Witness.
    12. And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put [it] upon the horns of the altar with thy finger; and all the remaining blood shalt thou pour out at the base of the altar.
    13. And thou shalt take all the fat that is upon the inwards, and the caul upon the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them,
    14. and shalt put them upon the altar. But the flesh of the bullock, and its hide, and its dung, shalt thou burn with fire outside the camp; for it is a sin offering.
    15. And thou shalt take the one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram.
