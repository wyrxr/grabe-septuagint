ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ ΚΕΦ. ΚΗ´.
γίαν Ἀβραὰμ τοῦ πατρός μου, σοὶ καὶ τῷ σπέρματί σου μετὰ
σέ, κληρονομῆσαι τὴν γῆν τῆς παροικήσεώς σου, ἣν δέδωκεν ὁ
5 Θεὸς τῷ Ἀβραάμ. Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ἰσαὰκ τὸν Ἰακώβ, καὶ ἐπορεύθη εἰς τὴν Μεσοποταμίαν πρὸς Λάβαν τὸν υἱὸν Βαθουήλ τοῦ
6 Σύρου, ἀδελφὸν δὲ Ῥεβέκκας τῆς μητρὸς Ἰακὼβ καὶ Ἠσαῦ. Ἴδε
δὲ Ἠσαῦ ὅτι εὐλόγησεν Ἰσαὰκ τὸν Ἰακώβ, καὶ ἀπέστειλεν εἰς
τὴν Μεσοποταμίαν Συρίας, λαβεῖν ἑαυτῷ γυναῖκα ἐκεῖθεν, ἐν τῷ
εὐλογεῖν αὐτόν, καὶ ἐνετείλατο αὐτῷ λέγων· οὐ λήψῃ γυναῖκα ἀπὸ
7 τῶν θυγατέρων Χαναάν, καὶ ἤκουσεν Ἰακὼβ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ,
καὶ τῆς μητρὸς ἑαυτοῦ, καὶ ἐπορεύθη εἰς τὴν Μεσοποταμίαν Συρίας.
8 Καὶ εἶδεν Ἠσαῦ ὅτι πονηραί εἰσιν αἱ θυγατέρες Χαναὰν ἔναντι Ἰσαὰκ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ,
9 καὶ ἐπορεύθη Ἠσαῦ πρὸς Ἰσμαήλ, καὶ ἔλαβε τὴν Μαελὲθ θυγατέρα Ἰσμαὴλ τοῦ υἱοῦ Ἀβραάμ, ἀδελφὴν Ναβαιώθ, πρὸς ταῖς γυναιξὶν αὐτοῦ γυναῖκα.
10 Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Ἰακὼβ ἀπὸ τοῦ φρέατος τοῦ ὅρκου, καὶ ἐπορεύθη εἰς Χαρράν·
11 Καὶ ἀπήντησε τόπῳ, καὶ ἐκοιμήθη ἐκεῖ· (ἔδυ γὰρ ὁ ἥλιος) καὶ ἔλαβεν ἀπὸ τῶν λίθων τοῦ τόπου, καὶ ἐπέθηκε πρὸς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐκοιμήθη ἐν τῷ τόπῳ ἐκείνῳ.
12 Καὶ ἐνυπνιάσθη, καὶ ἰδοὺ κλίμαξ ἐστηριγμένη ἐν τῇ γῇ, ἧς ἡ κεφαλὴ ἀφικνεῖτο εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν· καὶ οἱ ἄγγελοι τοῦ Θεοῦ ἀνέβαινον καὶ κατέβαινον ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς.
13 Ὁ δὲ Κύριος ἐπεστήρικτο ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς, καὶ εἶπεν· ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἀβραὰμ τοῦ πατρός σου, καὶ ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσαάκ, μὴ φοβοῦ· ἡ γῆ ἐφ᾿ ἧς σὺ καθεύδεις ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς, σοὶ δώσω αὐτὴν καὶ τῷ σπέρματί σου·
14 καὶ ἔσται τὸ σπέρμα σου, ὡς ἡ ἄμμος τῆς γῆς, καὶ πλατυνθήσεται ἐπὶ θάλασσαν, καὶ ἐπὶ λίβα, καὶ ἐπὶ βορρᾶν, καὶ ἐπ᾿ ἀνατολάς· καὶ ἐνευλογηθήσονται ἐν σοὶ πᾶσαι αἱ φυλαὶ τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἐν τῷ σπέρματί σου.
15 Καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ μετὰ σοῦ, διαφυλάσσων σε ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ πάσῃ, οὗ ἐὰν πορευθῇς, καὶ ἀποστρέψω σε εἰς τὴν γῆν ταύτην· ὅτι οὐ μή σε ἐγκαταλίπω, ἕως τοῦ ποιῆσαί με πάντα ὅσα ἐλάλησά σοι.
16 Καὶ ἐξηγέρθη Ἰακὼβ ἀπὸ τοῦ ὕπνου αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπεν· ὅτι ἔστι Κύριος ἐν τῷ τόπῳ τούτῳ, ἐγὼ δὲ οὐκ ᾔδειν.
17 Καὶ ἐφοβήθη, καὶ εἶπεν· ὡς φοβερὸς ὁ τόπος οὗτος· οὐκ ἔστι τοῦτο, ἀλλ᾿ οἶκος Θεοῦ, καὶ αὕτη ἡ πύλη τοῦ οὐρανοῦ.
18 Καὶ ἀνέστη Ἰακὼβ τὸ πρωΐ, καὶ ἔλαβε τὸν λίθον ὃν ἐθήκεν ἐκεῖ πρὸς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔστησεν αὐτὸν στήλην, καὶ ἐπέχεεν ἔλαιον ἐπὶ τὸ ἄκρον αὐτῆς.
19 Καὶ ἐκάλεσεν Ἰακὼβ τὸ ὄνομα

**GENESIS CHAPTER XXVIII**

...the blessing of Abraham my father,
unto thee and unto thy seed after thee,
that thou mayest inherit the land of thy sojourning,
which God gave unto Abraham.
**5** And Isaac sent Jacob away,
and he journeyed into Mesopotamia,
unto Laban, the son of Bethuel the Syrian,
the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.
**6** Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob,
and sent him forth into Mesopotamia of Syria,
to take for himself a wife from thence,
when he blessed him and charged him, saying,
"Thou shalt not take a wife from among the daughters of Canaan."
**7** And Jacob hearkened unto his father
and unto his mother,
and he journeyed into Mesopotamia of Syria.
**8** And Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan were evil
in the sight of Isaac his father.
**9** And Esau went unto Ishmael,
and took Maeleth the daughter of Ishmael,
Abraham's son, the sister of Nabaioth,
[to be] a wife unto his [other] wives.
**10** And Jacob went out from the well of the oath,
and journeyed toward Charran.
**11** And he happened upon a [certain] place,
and slept there, (for the sun had set;)
and he took from the stones of the place,
and placed [them] at his head,
and lay down in that place.
**12** And he dreamed, and behold,
a ladder was set up on the earth,
whose top reached unto heaven;
and the angels of God ascended and descended upon it.
**13** And the Lord was set upon it, and said:
"I am the Lord, the God of Abraham thy father,
and the God of Isaac; fear not.
The land whereon thou liest,
to thee will I give it, and to thy seed.
**14** And thy seed shall be as the sand of the earth,
and it shall spread abroad to the sea,
and to the south, and to the north, and to the east;
and in thee shall all the tribes of the earth be blessed,
and in thy seed.
**15** And behold, I am with thee,
keeping thee in every way, whithersoever thou goest;
and I will turn thee back into this land.
For I will not leave thee,
until I have done all things which I have spoken to thee."
**16** And Jacob awoke from his sleep, and said,
"Verily, the Lord is in this place;
yet I knew it not."
**17** And he was afraid, and said,
"How fearful is this place!
This is none other but the house of God,
and this is the gate of heaven."
**18** And Jacob rose up early in the morning,
and took the stone which he had placed there at his head,
and set it up for a pillar,
and poured oil upon the top of it.
**19** And Jacob called the name...
