᾿Ανηγγέλη τοίνυν ἐπὶ τοῦ προπαρῳχηκότος ἤδη ἔτους τῇ ἱερᾷ
Συνόδῳ τοῦ Βασιλείου τῆς Ἑλλάδος παρὰ τοῦ ἐνταῦθα ἐνδη-
μοῦντος κυρίου Ἐδουάρδου Μάσσωνος, Καθηγητοῦ ἐν τῷ Πα-
νεπιστημίῳ Ὄθωνος, τοῦ ἐπιτετραμμένου τὰ τῆς ἐν Ἀγγλίᾳ
Ἑταιρίας, τῆς πρὸς διάδοσιν τῆς Χριστιανικῆς Παιδείας συνε-
στηκυίας· ὅτι βούλεται μὲν αὕτη ἰδίοις ἀναλώμασιν ἐκδοῦναι
μὴ μόνον τὰ τῆς Παλαιᾶς καὶ τῆς Καινῆς Διαθήκης θεόπνευ-
στα βιβλία, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἕτερα τῶν ἐκκλησιαστικῶν Πατέρων τε
καὶ συγγραφέων, ἃ ἄν δοκῇ χρήσιμα εἶναι καὶ ἀναγκαῖα, ἵνα
δωρεὰν ταῖς ἁγίαις τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐκκλησίαις καὶ μάλιστα τοῖς ἐκ
τοῦ ἱεροῦ κλήρου διανεμηθῶσιν· ὅπως δὲ μὴ ἄλλο τι τέλος
δόξειεν εἶναι τοῦ ἐπιχειρήματος ἢ ἡ τῶν κτησαμένων πνευ-
ματικὴ ὠφέλεια καὶ ἡ κατὰ τὴν εὐσέβειαν προκοπὴ καὶ ὁ στη-
ριγμός, ἐξαιτεῖται τὴν τῆς ἱερᾶς ἡμῶν Συνόδου συναίνεσιν
τε καὶ συναντίληψιν, ἐπαγγελλομένη πάντα ἐκδοῦναι τῷ τύ-
πῳ τ᾿ ἀργύριον καταβάλλουσα ἐφ᾿ οἷς ἂν αὐτὴ συνευδοκῇ καὶ
ἀποφαίνηται, ὅτι ἀναγκαῖα ἐν τῷ παρόντι, καὶ ἐπιμεληθῆναι
βούληται, ὅπως ἂν ἐπὶ τὸ ἀκριβέστατον ἐκτυπωθείη. Καὶ ταῦ-
τα, ἵνα μή τις νοθείας ὑπόνοια παρεισφρήσασα ἀλυσιτελὲς καὶ
ἄχρηστον ὅλως τὸ ἔργον ἀποδείξη.
Ἡ οὖν ἱερὰ Σύνοδος ἐπιμελῶς τοῖς λεγομένοις ἐπιστήσα-
σα, καὶ διασκεψαμένη, καὶ μηδὲν ἐν αὐτοῖς ἀντίξουν τῇ ὀρ-
θοδοξίᾳ εὑρίσκουσα, τουναντίον δὲ ὄφελος οὐ σμικρὸν ἐκ τοῦ
τῶν θείων βιβλίων πολλαπλασιασμοῦ ἔσεσθαι πιστεύουσα εἰ
πάντες ἔχοιεν λαϊκοί τε καὶ οἱ ἐκ τοῦ ἱεροῦ Κλήρου τὰ ἁγνὰ
τοῦ Κυρίου λόγια εὐχερῶς ἀναγινώσκειν, καὶ τῷ κοινῷ τῆς
Ἐκκλησίας ἀγαθῷ συντελέσαι, ὅσον γε τὸ ἐπ᾿ αὐτῇ, βουλομέ-
νη, τῆς τε προθυμίας ἠγάσατο τὴν Ἑταιρίαν, καὶ τὴν δικαίαν
αἴτησιν ἀπεδέξατο, καὶ ἐπιτροπὴν συνέστησεν ἐκ τῶν ὑπογε-

6.  It was, therefore, reported unto the Holy Synod of the Kingdom of Greece, during the year now past, by Master Edward Masson, presently sojourning here, a Professor at the University of Othon, and he who is entrusted with the matters of the Society in England, the which hath been established for the propagation of Christian Education;
    
    That this same Society doth purpose, at its own charges, to put forth not only the divinely inspired books of the Old and New Testaments, but also other writings of the ecclesiastical Fathers and other authors, such as may be deemed both useful and needful, that they might be freely distributed unto the holy churches of God, and most especially unto those of the holy clergy;
    
    And that no other end should be perceived in this undertaking save the spiritual profit of them that acquire them, and the advancement in piety, and the firm establishment [in the faith], it doth seek the consent and the succour of our Holy Synod, promising to publish all things after the manner of the print, providing the monies for whatsoever it shall deem meet and declare necessary in this present age, and shall desire to take diligent care, that they be imprinted with the utmost exactitude. And these things [it doth request], lest any suspicion of falseness creeping in should render the work altogether unprofitable and of no avail.
    
    The Holy Synod, therefore, having diligently given heed unto the things which were spoken, and having taken counsel, and finding nought therein contrary to Orthodoxy, but, contrariwise, believing that no small profit would arise from the multiplication of the divine books, if all, both the laity and those of the holy clergy, should be able readily to read the pure words of the Lord, and desiring to contribute unto the common good of the Church, in so far as it lay within her power, did both commend the zeal of the Society, and accepted the righteous petition, and appointed a committee from among them that are hereunder—
