ΚΕΦ. ΚΑ´. ΙΗΣΟΥΣ ΝΑΥΗ 416
σαι αἱ πόλεις τῶν Λευιτῶν ἐν μέσω κατασχέσεως υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ,
τεσσαρακονταοκτὼ πόλεις, καὶ τὰ περισπόρια αὐτῶν κύκλω τῶν πό-
42 λεων τούτων· πόλις πόλις καὶ τὰ περισπόρια αὐτῆς κύκλω τῆς
πόλεως· οὕτω πάσαις ταῖς πόλεσι ταύτοις. Καὶ συνετέλεσεν Ἰη-
σοῦς διαμερίσας τὴν γῆν ἐν τοῖς ὁρίοις αὐτῆς· καὶ ἔδωκαν οἱ υἱοὶ
Ἰσραὴλ μερίδα τῷ Ἰησοῦ διὰ προστάγματος Κυρίου. Ἔδωκαν αὐ-
τῷ τὴν πόλιν, ἣν ᾐτήσατο· τὴν Θαμνασαρὰχ ἔδωκαν αὐτῷ ἐν τῷ
ὄρει Ἐφραίμ. Καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν Ἰησοῦς τὴν πόλιν, καὶ ᾤκησεν ἐν
αὐτῇ. Καὶ ἔλαβεν Ἰησοῦς τὰς μαχαίρας τὰς πετρίνας, ἐν αἷς
περιέτεμε τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ τοὺς γενομένους ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ ἐν τῇ
43 ἐρήμῳ, καὶ ἔθηκεν αὐτὰς ἐν Θαμνασαράχ. Καὶ ἔδωκε Κύριος τῷ
Ἰσραὴλ πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν, ἣν ὤμοσε δοῦναι τοῖς πατράσιν αὐτῶν·
44 καὶ κατεκληρονόμησαν αὐτὴν, καὶ κατώκησαν ἐν αὐτῇ. Καὶ κατέ-
παυσεν αὐτοῖς Κύριος κυκλόθεν, καθότι ὤμοσε τοῖς πατράσιν αὐ-
τῶν, καὶ οὐκ ἀνέστη οὐδεὶς κατενώπιον αὐτῶν ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν
ἐχθρῶν αὐτῶν· πάντας τοὺς ἐχθροὺς αὐτῶν παρέδωκε Κύριος (αὐ-
45 τοῖς) εἰς τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν. Οὐ διέπεσε ῥῆμα ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν
ῥημάτων τῶν καλῶν, ὧν ἐλάλησε Κύριος τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ· πάν-
τα παρεγένοντο.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΒ´. XXII.

1 ΤΟΤΕ συνεκάλεσεν Ἰησοῦς τοὺς Ῥουβηνίτας, καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς
2 Γὰδ, καὶ τὸ ἥμισυ φυλῆς Μανασσῆ, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· ὑμεῖς ἀ-
κηκόατε πάντα ὅσα ἐνετείλατο ὑμῖν Μωυσῆς ὁ παῖς Κυρίου, καὶ
(οὐχ) εἰσηκούσατε τῆς φωνῆς μου κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἐνετειλάμην
3 ὑμῖν. Οὐκ ἐγκατελείπατε τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς ὑμῶν ταύτας τὰς ἡμέ-
ρας· καὶ πλείους ἕως τῆς σήμερον ἡμέρας ἐφυλάξατε τὴν ἐντο-
4 λὴν Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ὑμῶν. Νῦν δὲ κατέπαυσε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς
ὑμῶν τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς ὑμῶν, ὃν τρόπον εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· νῦν
οὖν ἀποστραφέντες, ἀπέλθατε εἰς τοὺς οἴκους ὑμῶν, καὶ εἰς
τὴν γῆν τῆς κατασχέσεως ὑμῶν, ἣν ἔδωκεν ὑμῖν Μωυσῆς δοῦ-
5 λος Κυρίου ἐν τῷ πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου. Ἀλλὰ φυλάξασθε
σφόδρα ποιεῖν τὰς ἐντολὰς καὶ τὸν νόμον, ὃν ἐνετείλατο ὑμῖν
Μωυσῆς ὁ παῖς Κυρίου, ἀγαπᾶν Κύριον τὸν Θεὸν ὑμῶν, πο-
ρεύεσθαι ἐν πάσαις ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὐτοῦ, φυλάσσεσθαι τὰς ἐντολὰς

**Joshua 21**
<sup>41</sup> were forty-eight cities, and their suburbs round about these cities.
<sup>42</sup> Every city with its suburbs round about the city; thus [was it] for all these cities.
And Joshua finished dividing the land by its borders; and the children of Israel gave a portion unto Joshua, according to the commandment of the Lord. They gave him the city which he asked for, [even] Timnath-serah, which they gave him in the mount of Ephraim. And Joshua built the city, and dwelt therein.
<sup>43</sup> And Joshua took the knives of stone, wherewith he had circumcised the children of Israel who were born on the way in the wilderness, and he laid them in Timnath-serah.
<sup>44</sup> And the Lord gave unto Israel all the land, which He sware to give unto their fathers; and they inherited it, and dwelt therein.
<sup>45</sup> And the Lord gave them rest round about, just as He sware unto their fathers, and there stood up none before them of all their enemies; all their enemies did the Lord deliver [unto them] into their hands.
<sup>46</sup> There failed not one word of all the good words, which the Lord had spoken unto the children of Israel; all came to pass.

**Joshua 22**
<sup>1</sup> THEN Joshua called the Reubenites, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh,
<sup>2</sup> and said unto them: Ye have heard all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you, and [not] ye have hearkened unto my voice concerning all that I commanded you.
<sup>3</sup> Ye have not forsaken your brethren [all] these days; yea, many [days] even unto this day have ye kept the commandment of the Lord your God.
<sup>4</sup> Now therefore the Lord your God hath given rest unto your brethren, in the manner which He spake unto them; now then, turn ye, and get you unto your tents, and unto the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you beyond the Jordan.
<sup>5</sup> But take ye diligent heed to do the commandments and the law, which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you: to love the Lord your God, and to walk in all His ways, and to keep His commandments,
