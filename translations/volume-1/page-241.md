226 ΛΕΥΙΤΙΚΟΝ ΚΕΦ. Κϛ΄. ΚΖ΄.
43 μνησθήσομαι. Καὶ ἐγκαταλειφθήσεται ἡ γῆ ὑπ᾿ αὐτῶν, τότε προσδέξεται ἡ γῆ τὰ σάββατα αὐτῆς, ἐν τῷ ἐρημωθῆναι αὐτὴν δι᾿ αὐτούς· καὶ αὐτοὶ προσδέξονται τὰς αὐτῶν ἀνομίας, ἀνθ᾿ ὧν τὰ κρίματά μου ὑπερίδον, καὶ τοῖς προστάγμασί μου προσώχθισαν τῇ ψυχῇ αὐτῶν.
44 Καὶ οὐδ᾿ ὡς ὄντων αὐτῶν ἐν τῇ γῇ τῶν ἐχθρῶν αὐτῶν οὐχ ὑπερίδον αὐτοὺς, οὐδὲ προσώχθισα αὐτοῖς ὥστε ἐξαναλῶσαι αὐτοὺς, τοῦ διασκεδάσαι τὴν διαθήκην μου τὴν πρὸς
45 αὐτοὺς, ὅτι ἐγὼ (εἰμι) Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς αὐτῶν. Καὶ μνησθήσομαι αὐτῶν τῆς διαθήκης τῆς προτέρας, ὅτε ἐξήγαγον αὐτοὺς ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, ἐξ οἴκου δουλείας ἔναντι τῶν ἐθνῶν, τοῦ εἶναι αὐτῶν
46 Θεός· ἐγὼ (εἰμι) Κύριος. Ταῦτα τὰ κρίματα (μου) καὶ τὰ προστάγματά (μου), καὶ ὁ νόμος, ὃν ἔδωκε Κύριος ἀναμέσον αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀναμέσον τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, ἐν τῷ ὄρει Σινᾶ, ἐν χειρὶ Μωυσῆ.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΖ΄. XXVII.

1 ΚΑὶ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, λέγων·
2 λάλησον τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐρεῖς αὐτοῖς· ἄνθρωπος ὃς ἂν εὔξηται εὐχὴν
3 ὥστε τιμὴν τῆς ψυχῆς (αὐτοῦ) τῷ Κυρίῳ, ἔσται ἡ τιμὴ αὐτοῦ τοῦ ἄρσενος ἀπὸ εἰκοσαετοῦς ἕως ἑξηκονταετοῦς, ἔσται αὐτοῦ ἡ
4 τιμὴ πεντήκοντα δίδραχμα ἀργυρίου τῷ σταθμῷ τῷ ἁγίῳ· τῆς
5 δὲ θηλείας ἔσται ἡ συντίμησις τριάκοντα δίδραχμα. Ἐὰν δὲ ἀπὸ πενταετοῦς ἕως εἰκοσιετοῦς, ἔστω ἡ τιμὴ αὐτοῦ τοῦ ἄρσενος εἴκοσι δίδραχμα· τῆς δὲ θηλείας, δέκα δίδραχμα.
6 Ἀπὸ δὲ μηνιαίου ἕως πενταετοῦς, ἔσται ἡ τιμὴ αὐτοῦ τοῦ ἄρσενος πέντε δίδραχμα
7 ἀργυρίου· τῆς δὲ θηλείας ἡ τιμὴ, τρία δίδραχμα ἀργυρίου. Ἐὰν δὲ ἀπὸ ἑξηκονταετῶν καὶ ἐπάνω, ἐὰν μὲν ἄρσεν ᾖ, ἔσται ἡ τιμὴ πεντεκαίδεκα δίδραχμα ἀργυρίου· ἐὰν δὲ θήλεια, δέκα δίδραχμα.
8 Ἐὰν δὲ ταπεινὸς ᾖ τῇ τιμῇ αὐτοῦ, στήσεται αὐτὸν ἐναντίον τοῦ ἱερέως, καὶ τιμήσεται αὐτὸν ὁ ἱερεύς· καθάπερ ἰσχύει ἡ χεὶρ αὐτοῦ εὐξαμένου, τιμήσεται αὐτὸν ὁ ἱερεύς.
9 Ἐὰν δὲ ἀπὸ τῶν κτηνῶν τῶν προσφερομένων ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν δῶρον τῷ Κυρίῳ, ὃς ἂν δῷ
10 ἀπὸ τούτων τῷ Κυρίῳ, ἔσται ἅγιον. Οὐχ ἀλλάξει αὐτὸ, καὶ οὐκ ἀντερεῖ αὐτῷ, καλὸν πονηρῷ, οὐδὲ πονηρὸν καλῷ· ἐὰν δὲ ἀλλάξῃ (αὐτὸ) κτῆνος κτήνει, ἔσται αὐτὸ καὶ τὸ ἄλλαγμα

**Leviticus 26**

43 I shall remember [them]. And the land shall be forsaken by them,
    then shall the land accept her Sabbaths,
    when it hath been made desolate because of them:
    and they themselves shall accept their iniquities,
    forasmuch as they despised My judgments,
    and their soul abhorred My ordinances.
44 And even whilst they be in the land of their enemies,
    I did not despise them,
    neither did I abhor them,
    to destroy them utterly
    and to break My covenant that [I made] with them;
45 for I am the Lord their God.
    And I shall remember for their sake the former covenant,
    when I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt,
    from the house of bondage, before the nations,
    to be their God.
46 I am the Lord. These are My judgments and My ordinances, and the Law
    which the Lord gave between Him and between the children of Israel,
    upon Mount Sinai, by the hand of Moses.

**Chapter 27**

1 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying:
2 "Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them:
    When a man shall make a vow
3 concerning the valuation of a person unto the Lord,
    then shall the valuation of a male from twenty years old
    even unto sixty years old be,
4 his valuation, fifty shekels of silver, according to the sacred shekel;
5 and for the female, her valuation shall be thirty shekels.
    And if [the person be] from five years old even unto twenty years old,
    then shall the valuation of the male be twenty shekels;
    and for the female, ten shekels.
6 And if [the person be] from one month old even unto five years old,
    then shall the valuation of the male be five shekels of silver;
7 and for the female, her valuation, three shekels of silver.
    And if [the person be] from sixty years old and upward,
    if it be a male, then shall the valuation be fifteen shekels of silver;
    and if it be a female, ten shekels.
8 But if he be too poor for his valuation,
    then shall he present him before the priest,
    and the priest shall value him;
    according to what the hand of him that vowed can afford,
    so shall the priest value him.
9 And if [the vow be] of the cattle
    which men offer a gift unto the Lord,
    whatsoever one giveth of these unto the Lord,
    it shall be holy.
10 He shall not change it, nor make exchange for it,
    a good for a bad, nor a bad for a good;
    and if he shall indeed exchange a beast for a beast,
    then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.
