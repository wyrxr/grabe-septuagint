242 ΑΡΙΘΜΟΙ ΚΕΦ. Ε'. ς'.
ζώῃ σε Κύριος ἐν ἀρᾷ καὶ ἐνόρκιον ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ λαοῦ σου, ἐν τῷ
δοῦναι Κύριον τὸν μηρόν σου διαπεπτωκότα, καὶ τὴν κοιλίαν σου πε-
22 πρησμένην· καὶ εἰσελεύσεται τὸ ὕδωρ τὸ ἐπικαταρώμενον τοῦτο εἰς
    τὴν κοιλίαν σου, πρῆσαι γαστέρα, καὶ διαπεσεῖν μηρόν σου. Καὶ ἐ-
23 ρεῖ ἡ γυνή· γένοιτο, γένοιτο. Καὶ γράψει ὁ ἱερεὺς τὰς ἀρὰς ταύ-
    τας εἰς βιβλίον, καὶ ἐξαλείψει εἰς τὸ ὕδωρ τοῦ ἐλεγμοῦ τοῦ ἐπι-
24 καταρωμένου· καὶ ποτιεῖ τὴν γυναῖκα τὸ ὕδωρ τοῦ ἐλεγμοῦ τοῦ
    ἐπικαταρωμένου, καὶ εἰσελεύσεται εἰς αὐτὴν τὸ ὕδωρ τὸ ἐπικατα-
25 ρώμενον τοῦ ἐλεγμοῦ. Καὶ λήψεται ὁ ἱερεὺς ἐκ χειρὸς τῆς γυ-
    ναικὸς τὴν θυσίαν τῆς ζηλοτυπίας, καὶ ἐπιθήσει τὴν θυσίαν ἔναντι
26 Κυρίου, καὶ προσείσει αὐτὴν ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον· καὶ δράξεται ὁ
    ἱερεὺς ἀπὸ τῆς θυσίας τὸ μνημόσυνον αὐτῆς, καὶ ἀνοίσει αὐτὸ ἐπὶ
    τὸ θυσιαστήριον, καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα ποτιεῖ τὴν γυναῖκα τὸ ὕδωρ·
27 καὶ ποτιεῖ αὐτὴν τὸ ὕδωρ, καὶ ἔσται ἐὰν μὲν ᾖ μεμιαμμένη, καὶ
    λήθῃ λάθῃ τὸν ἄνδρα αὐτῆς, καὶ εἰσελεύσεται εἰς αὐτὴν τὸ ὕδωρ
    τοῦ ἐλεγμοῦ τὸ ἐπικαταρώμενον, καὶ πρησθήσεται τὴν κοιλίαν αὐ-
    τῆς, καὶ διαπεσεῖται ὁ μηρὸς αὐτῆς, καὶ ἔσται ἡ γυνὴ εἰς ἀρὰν
28 ἐν τῷ λαῷ αὐτῆς. Ἐὰν δὲ μὴ μιανθῇ ἡ γυνή, καὶ καθαρά ᾖ, καὶ
29 ἀθῶα ἔσται, καὶ ἐκσπερματιεῖ σπέρμα. Οὗτος ὁ νόμος τῆς ζηλο-
30 τυπίας, ᾧ ἂν παραβῇ ἡ γυνὴ ὕπανδρος οὖσα, καὶ μιανθῇ· ἢ ἄν-
    θρωπος ᾧ ἐὰν ἐπέλθῃ ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν πνεῦμα ζηλώσεως, καὶ ζηλώσῃ
    τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ, καὶ στήσῃ τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ ἔναντι Κυρίου,
31 καὶ ποιήσῃ αὐτῇ ὁ ἱερεὺς πάντα τὸν νόμον τοῦτον· καὶ ἀθῶος
    ἔσται ὁ ἄνθρωπος ἀπὸ ἁμαρτίας, καὶ ἡ γυνὴ ἐκείνη λήψεται τὴν
    ἁμαρτίαν αὐτῆς.

ΚΕΦ. ς'. VI.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, λέγων· 2 λάλησον τοῖς υἱ-
    οῖς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτούς· ἀνὴρ ἢ γυνὴ ὡς ἐὰν μεγάλως
3 εὔξηται εὐχὴν ἀραγνίσασθαι ἁγνείαν Κυρίῳ, ἀπὸ οἴνου καὶ
    σίκερα ἁγνισθήσεται καὶ ὄξος ἐξ οἴνου καὶ ὄξος ἐκ σί-
    κερα οὐ πίεται, καὶ ὅσα κατεργάζεται ἐκ σταφυλῆς οὐ πίεται, καὶ
4 σταφυλὴν πρόσφατον καὶ σταφῖδα, οὐ φάγεται· πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας
    τῆς εὐχῆς αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ πάντων ὅσα γίνεται ἐξ ἀμπέλου οἴνου,
5 ἀπὸ σπερματύλλων ἕως γίγαρτου, οὐ φάγεται. Πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας

**English Translation:**

**NUMBERS CHAPTER 5**

21 The Lord make thee to live as a curse and an oath among thy people, in the Lord’s causing thy thigh to fall away and thy belly to swell.
22 And this water, which brings a curse, shall enter into thy belly, to make the belly to swell, and thy thigh to fall away.
23 And the woman shall say, Amen, Amen. And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot them out into the water of examination that brings a curse.
24 And he shall cause the woman to drink the water of examination that brings a curse, and the water that brings a curse, even the water of examination, shall enter into her.
25 And the priest shall take from the hand of the woman the offering of jealousy, and he shall lay the offering before the Lord, and he shall wave it over the altar.
26 And the priest shall take from the offering the memorial of it, and he shall offer it up upon the altar, and after these things, he shall cause the woman to drink the water.
27 And he shall cause her to drink the water; and it shall be, if indeed she be defiled, and hath by stealth been unfaithful to her husband, then shall the water of examination that brings a curse enter into her, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall fall away; and the woman shall be a curse among her people.
28 But if the woman be not defiled, and be clean, then shall she be clear [of guilt],
29 and she shall conceive seed. This is the law of jealousy, when a woman, being under her husband, goeth astray, and is defiled;
30 or when a man, if the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous over his wife, and he shall set his wife before the Lord,
31 and the priest shall perform unto her all this law: then shall the man be clear from sin, and that woman shall bear her iniquity.

**CHAPTER 6**

1 AND the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: When either man or woman shall make a solemn vow to dedicate a consecration unto the Lord,
3 he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink; and he shall drink no vinegar of wine, nor vinegar of strong drink; nor shall he drink any [liquor] made from grapes; and fresh grapes and dried grapes shall he not eat.
4 All the days of his vow, from all that cometh of the vine of wine,
5 from the small seeds even unto the grape-stone, shall he not eat. All the days
