70 ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ ΚΕΦ. ΛΗʹ.
17 ἐστιν. Ἡ δὲ εἶπε· τί μοι δώσεις, ἐὰν εἰσέλθῃς πρὸς με; Ὁ δὲ
18 εἶπεν· ἐγὼ σοι ἀποστελῶ ἔριφον αἰγῶν ἐκ τῶν προβάτων. Ἡ δὲ εἶπε· ἐὰν δῷς ἀῤῥαβῶνα, ἕως τοῦ ἀποστεῖλαί σε. Ὁ δὲ εἶπε· τίνα τὸν ἀῤῥαβῶνα σοι δώσω ; Ἡ δὲ εἶπε· τὸν δακτύλιόν σου, καὶ τὸν
ὁρμίσκον, καὶ τὴν ῥάβδον τὴν ἐν τῇ χειρί σου. Καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐ-
19 τῇ, καὶ εἰσῆλθε πρὸς αὐτήν· καὶ ἐν γαστρὶ ἔλαβεν ἐξ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἀναστᾶσα, ἀπῆλθε, καὶ περιείλετο τὸ θέριστρον αὐτῆς ἀφ᾿ ἑαυτῆς,
20 καὶ ἐνεδύσατο τὰ ἱμάτια τῆς χηρεύσεως αὐτῆς. Ἀπέστειλε δὲ Ἰούδας τὸν ἔριφον ἐξ αἰγῶν ἐν χειρὶ τοῦ ποιμένος αὐτοῦ τοῦ Ὀδολ-
λαμείτου, κομίσασθαι τὸν ἀῤῥαβῶνα παρὰ τῆς γυναικός· καὶ οὐχ
21 εὗρεν αὐτήν. Ἐπηρώτησε δὲ τοὺς ἄνδρας τοὺς ἐκ τοῦ τόπου, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· ποῦ ἐστιν ἡ πόρνη ἡ γενομένη ἐν Αἰνὰν ἐπὶ τῆς
22 ὁδοῦ; Καὶ εἶπαν· οὐκ ἦν ἐνταῦθα πόρνη. Καὶ ἀπεστράφη πρὸς Ἰού-
23 δαν, καὶ εἶπεν· οὐχ εὗρον, καὶ οἱ ἄνθρωποι οἱ ἐκ τοῦ τόπου λέ-γουσι, μὴ εἶναι ἐνταῦθα πόρνην. Εἶπε δὲ Ἰούδας· ἐχέτω αὐτά· ἀλλὰ μὴ ποτε καταγελασθῶμεν· ἐγὼ μὲν ἀπέσταλκα τὸν ἔριφον τοῦτον,
24 σὺ δὲ οὐχ εὕρηκας. Ἐγένετο δὲ μετὰ τρίμηνον ἀπηγγέλη τῷ Ἰούδα, λέγοντες· ἐκπεπόρνευκε Θάμαρ ἡ νύμφη σου, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐν γαστρὶ
ἔχει ἐκ πορνείας. Εἶπε δὲ Ἰούδας· ἐξαγάγετε αὐτήν, καὶ κατακαυ-
25 θήτω. Αὕτη δὲ ἀγομένη ἀπέστειλε πρὸς τὸν πενθερὸν αὐτῆς, λέγουσα· ἐκ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου οὗτινος ταῦτά ἐστιν, ἐγὼ ἐν γαστρὶ ἔχω. Καὶ εἶπεν· ἐπίγνωθι, τίνος ὁ δακτύλιος καὶ ὁ ὁρμίσκος καὶ ἡ ῥάβδος
26 αὕτη. Ἐπέγνω δὲ Ἰούδας, καὶ εἶπε· δεδικαίωται Θάμαρ ἢ ἐγώ, οὗ ἕνεκεν οὐκ ἔδωκα αὐτὴν Σηλὼμ τῷ υἱῷ μου· καὶ οὐ προσέ-
27 θετο ἔτι τοῦ γνῶναι αὐτήν. Ἐγένετο δὲ ἡνίκα ἔτεκε , καὶ τῇδε
28 ἦν δίδυμα ἐν τῇ κοιλίᾳ αὐτῆς. Ἐγένετο δὲ ἐν τῷ τίκτειν αὐτήν, ὁ εἷς προσεξήνεγκε τὴν χεῖρα· λαβοῦσα δὲ ἡ μαῖα, ἔδησεν ἐπὶ τὴν
29 χεῖρα αὐτοῦ κόκκινον, λέγουσα· οὗτος ἐξελεύσεται πρότερος. Ὁ δὲ ἐπισυνήγαγε τὴν χεῖρα, καὶ εὐθὺς ἐξῆλθεν ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ.
Ἡ δὲ εἶπε· τί διεκόπη διὰ σὲ φραγμός; καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸ ὄνομα
30 αὐτοῦ, Φαρές. Καὶ μετὰ τοῦτο ἐξῆλθεν ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ, ἐφ᾿ ᾧ ἦν ἐπὶ τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ τὸ κόκκινον· καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ, Ζαρά.

**GENESIS CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT**

17 . . .is. And she said: "What wilt thou give me, if thou comest in unto me?"

18 And he said: "I will send thee a kid of the goats from the sheep." And she said: "If thou wilt give a pledge, until thou sendest [it]." And he said: "What pledge shall I give thee?" And she said: "Thy signet ring, and thy cord, and thy staff which is in thy hand."

19 And he gave [them] unto her, and went in unto her; and she conceived by him. And she arose and departed, and removed her veil from herself,

20 and put on the garments of her widowhood. And Judah sent the kid of goats by the hand of his shepherd, the Adullamite, to retrieve the pledge from the woman; but he found her not.

21 And he asked the men of that place, saying unto them: "Where is the harlot who was in Enaim by the wayside?"

22 And they said: "There hath been no harlot here." And he returned unto Judah,

23 and said: "I found her not, and the men of the place say that there is no harlot here." Then said Judah: "Let her keep them; lest perhaps we be mocked. Lo, I have sent this kid, but thou hast not found [her]."

24 And it came to pass after three months, that it was reported unto Judah, saying: "Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath committed harlotry, and behold, she is with child by harlotry." And Judah said: "Bring her forth, and let her be burned."

25 But as she was being brought forth, she sent [word] unto her father-in-law, saying: "By the man whose these things are, I am with child." And she said: "Recognize, I pray thee, whose is this signet ring, and cord, and staff."

26 And Judah recognized [them], and said: "Tamar is more righteous than I; because I gave her not to Shelah my son." And he knew her again no more.

27 And it came to pass when she was to give birth, that behold, twins were in her womb.

28 And it came to pass as she gave birth, that one put forth his hand; and the midwife took [it], and bound a scarlet [thread] upon his hand,

29 saying: "This one shall come forth first." But he drew back his hand, and immediately his brother came out. And she said: "Wherefore has a breach been broken through thee?" And she called his name Perez.

30 And after this, his brother came out, upon whose hand was the scarlet [thread]; and she called his name Zerah.
