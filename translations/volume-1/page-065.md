ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ ΚΕΦ. ΚΘʹ.
11 Λάβαν τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ τῆς μητρὸς αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐφίλησεν Ἰακὼβ τὴν
12 Ῥαχήλ, καὶ βοήσας τῇ φωνῇ αὐτοῦ, ἔκλαυσε. Καὶ ἀνήγγειλεν
    Ἰακὼβ τῇ Ῥαχήλ, ὅτι ἀδελφὸς τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῆς ἐστι, καὶ ἔτι
    υἱὸς Ῥεβέκκας ἐστί· καὶ δραμοῦσα ἀπήγγειλε τῷ πατρὶ αὐτῆς κατὰ
13 τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἤκουσε Λάβαν τὸ ὄνομα Ἰα-
    κὼβ τοῦ υἱοῦ τῆς ἀδελφῆς αὐτοῦ, ἔδραμεν εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτοῦ,
    καὶ περιλαβὼν αὐτὸν ἐφίλησε, καὶ εἰσήγαγεν αὐτὸν εἰς τὸν οἶκον
    αὐτοῦ· καὶ διηγήσατο τῷ Λάβαν πάντα τοὺς λόγους τούτους.
14 Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Λάβαν· ἐκ τῶν ὀστῶν μου, καὶ ἐκ τῆς σαρκὸς
15 μου εἶ σύ· καὶ ἦν μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ μῆνα ἡμερῶν. Εἶπε δὲ Λάβαν τῷ
    Ἰακώβ· ἔτι γὰρ ἀδελφός μου εἶ, οὐ δουλεύσεις μοι δωρεάν· ἀ-
16 πάγγειλόν μοι, τίς ὁ μισθός σου ἐστί. Τῷ δὲ Λάβαν ἦσαν δύο
    θυγατέρες· ὄνομα τῇ μείζονι, Λεία· καὶ ὄνομα τῇ νεωτέρᾳ, Ῥα-
17 χήλ. Οἱ δὲ ὀφθαλμοὶ Λείας ἀσθενεῖς· Ῥαχὴλ δὲ ἦν καλὴ τῷ
18 εἴδει, καὶ ὡραία τῇ ὄψει. Ἠγάπησε δὲ Ἰακὼβ τὴν Ῥαχήλ, καὶ
    εἶπε· δουλεύσω σοι ἑπτὰ ἔτη περὶ Ῥαχὴλ τῆς θυγατρός σου τῆς
19 νεωτέρας. Εἶπε δὲ (αὐτῷ) Λάβαν· βέλτιον δοῦναί με αὐτήν σοι,
    ἢ δοῦναι με αὐτὴν ἀνδρὶ ἑτέρῳ· οἴκησον μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ. Καὶ ἐδούλευ-
20 σεν Ἰακὼβ περὶ Ῥαχὴλ ἑπτὰ ἔτη· καὶ ἦσαν ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ ὡς
    ἡμέραι ὀλίγαι, παρὰ τὸ ἀγαπᾶν αὐτὸν αὐτήν. Εἶπε δὲ Ἰακὼβ
21 τῷ Λάβαν· ἀπόδος μοι τὴν γυναῖκά μου, (πεπλήρωνται γὰρ αἱ
    ἡμέραι μου) ὅπως εἰσέλθω πρὸς αὐτήν. Συνήγαγε δὲ Λάβαν πάν-
22 τας τοὺς ἄνδρας τοῦ τόπου, καὶ ἐποίησε γάμον. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἑ-
23 σπέρα, καὶ λαβὼν Λείαν τὴν θυγατέρα αὐτοῦ, εἰσήγαγεν αὐτὴν
    πρὸς Ἰακώβ· καὶ εἰσῆλθε πρὸς αὐτήν Ἰακώβ. Ἔδωκε δὲ Λάβαν
24 Ζελφὰν Λεία τῇ θυγατρὶ αὐτοῦ τὴν παιδίσκην αὐτοῦ, αὐτῇ παιδί-
25 σκην. Ἐγένετο δὲ πρωΐ, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἦν Λεία. Εἶπε δὲ Ἰακὼβ τῷ
    Λάβαν· τί τοῦτο ἐποίησάς μοι; οὐ περὶ Ῥαχὴλ ἐδούλευσα παρὰ
26 σοι; καὶ ἵνατι παρελογίσω με; Εἶπε δὲ Λάβαν· οὐκ ἔστιν οὕτως
    ἐν τῷ τόπῳ ἡμῶν, δοῦναι τὴν νεωτέραν πρὶν τὴν πρεσβυτέραν.
27 Συντέλεσον οὖν τὰ ἕβδομα ταύτης, καὶ δώσω σοι καὶ ταύτην ἀντὶ
    τῆς ἐργασίας, ἧς ἐργᾷ παρ᾿ ἐμοὶ ἔτι ἑπτὰ ἔτη ἕτερα. Ἐποίησε
28 δὲ Ἰακὼβ οὕτως, καὶ ἀνεπλήρωσε τὰ ἕβδομα ταύτης· καὶ ἔδωκεν
    αὐτῷ Λάβαν Ῥαχὴλ τὴν θυγατέρα αὐτοῦ αὐτῷ γυναῖκα. Ἔδωκε
29 δὲ Λάβαν Ῥαχὴλ τῇ θυγατρὶ αὐτοῦ Βαλλὰν τὴν παιδίσκην αὐτοῦ,
30 αὐτῇ παιδίσκην. Καὶ εἰσῆλθε πρὸς Ῥαχήλ, ἠγάπησε δὲ Ῥαχὴλ

**Genesis, Chapter 29**

11 Laban, his mother's brother. And Jacob kissed Rachel,
12 and raising his voice, he wept. And Jacob made it known unto Rachel that he was her father's brother, and moreover, Rebekah's son. And she ran and told her father these words.
13 And it came to pass, when Laban heard the name of Jacob, his sister's son, that he ran forth to meet him, and embraced him and kissed him, and brought him into his house. And Jacob rehearsed unto Laban all these things.
14 And Laban said unto him, "Surely, thou art of my bone and of my flesh." And he abode with him a full month of days.
15 Then Laban said unto Jacob, "Because thou art my brother, shalt thou therefore serve me for nought? Tell me, what shall thy wages be?"
16 Now Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.
17 And Leah's eyes were weak; but Rachel was beautiful of form and fair of countenance.
18 And Jacob loved Rachel, and he said, "I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter."
19 And Laban said [unto him], "It is better that I give her to thee than that I should give her to another man. Abide with me."
20 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, because he loved her so deeply.
21 And Jacob said unto Laban, "Give me my wife, (for my days are fulfilled,) that I may go in unto her."
22 And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a marriage feast.
23 And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to Jacob; and Jacob went in unto her.
24 And Laban gave Zilpah his maidservant to Leah his daughter, [to be] her maidservant.
25 And it came to pass in the morning, and, behold, it was Leah. And Jacob said to Laban, "What is this thou hast done unto me? Did I not serve with thee for Rachel? Wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?"
26 And Laban said, "It is not so done in our country, to give the younger before the elder.
27 Fulfil then the week of this one, and I will give thee this also for the service wherewith thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years."
28 And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week; and Laban gave him Rachel his daughter to him to wife.
29 And Laban gave Bilhah his maidservant to Rachel his daughter, [to be] her maidservant.
30 And he went in unto Rachel, and he loved Rachel
