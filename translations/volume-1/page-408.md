ΚΕΦ. Ιʹ. Ι Η Σ Ο Υ Σ Ν Α Υ Η 393
πρὸς Ἰησοῦν καὶ πρὸς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐγένοντο ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῶν, καὶ
2 ἐφοβήθησαν ἐν ἑαυτοῖς σφόδρα· ἤδεισαν γὰρ ὅτι ἡ πόλις μεγάλη
Γαβαὼν ὡσεὶ καὶ μία τῶν μητροπόλεων τῶν βασιλέων, καὶ ὅτι
αὐτὴ μεγάλη ὑπὲρ τὴν Γαί, καὶ πάντες οἱ ἄνδρες αὐτῆς ἰσχυροί.
3 Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ἀδωνιβεζὲκ βασιλεὺς Ἱερουσαλὴμ πρὸς Αἰλὰμ
βασιλέα Χεβρὼν, καὶ πρὸς Φεραὰμ βασιλέα Ἱεριμοὺθ, καὶ πρὸς
Ἰαριὲ βασιλέα Λαχεὶς, καὶ πρὸς Δαβεὶρ βασιλέα Ὀδολλὰμ, λέγων·
4 δεῦτε, ἀνάβητε πρὸς με καὶ βοηθήσατέ μοι, καὶ ἐκπολεμήσωμεν
τὴν Γαβαών· ἠτομόλησαν γὰρ πρὸς Ἰησοῦν καὶ πρὸς τοὺς
υἱοὺς Ἰσραήλ.
5 Καὶ συνήχθησαν, καὶ ἀνέβησαν οἱ πέντε βασιλεῖς
τῶν Ἰεβουσαίων, βασιλεὺς Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ βασιλεὺς Χεβρὼν, καὶ
βασιλεὺς Ἱεριμοὺθ, καὶ βασιλεὺς Λαχεὶς, καὶ βασιλεὺς Ὀδολλὰμ,
αὐτοὶ καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς αὐτῶν καὶ περιεκάθισαν τὴν Γαβαὼν, καὶ
ἐξεπολιόρκουν αὐτήν.
6 Καὶ ἀπέστειλαν οἱ κατοικοῦντες Γαβαὼν πρὸς
Ἰησοῦν εἰς τὴν παρεμβολὴν Ἰσραὴλ εἰς Γάλγαλα, λέγοντες· μὴ
ἐκλύσῃς τὰς χεῖράς σου ἀπὸ τῶν παίδων σου· ἀνάβηθι πρὸς ἡμᾶς ταχύγας, καὶ ἐξελοῦ ἡμᾶς, καὶ βοήθησον ἡμῖν· ὅτι συνηγμένοι εἰσὶν ἐφ᾿ ἡμᾶς πάντες οἱ βασιλεῖς τῶν Ἀμοῤῥαίων, οἱ κατοικοῦντες τὴν ὀρεινήν.
7 Καὶ ἀνέβη Ἰησοῦς ἐκ Γαλγάλων, αὐτὸς
καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ὁ πολεμιστὴς μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, πᾶς δυνατὸς ἐν ἰσχύϊ.
8 Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Ἰησοῦν· μὴ φοβηθῇς αὐτοὺς, εἰς γὰρ τὰς
χεῖράς σου παραδέδωκα αὐτούς· οὐχ ὑποστήσεται ἐξ αὐτῶν οὐδεὶς
ἐνώπιον ὑμῶν.
9 Καὶ ἐπεὶ παρεγένετο Ἰησοῦς ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς ἄφνω
ὅλην τὴν νύκτα ἐπορεύθη (Ἰησοῦς) ἐκ Γαλγάλων.
10 Καὶ ἐξέστησεν
αὐτοὺς Κύριος ἀπὸ προσώπου Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ συνέτριψεν αὐτοὺς Κύριος συντριβὴν μεγάλην ἐν Γαβαὼν· καὶ κατεδίωξαν αὐτοὺς ὁδὸν
ἀναβάσεως Βηθωρὼν, καὶ κατέκοπτον αὐτοὺς ἕως Ἀζηκὰ καὶ ἕως
Μακηδά.
11 Ἐν δὲ τῷ φεύγειν αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ προσώπου υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ
ἐπὶ τῆς καταβάσεως Βηθωρὼν, καὶ Κύριος ἐπέῤῥιψεν αὐτοῖς λίθους
χαλάζης ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ἕως Ἀζηκὰ, καὶ ἀπέθανον· καὶ ἐγένοντο
πλείους οἱ ἀποθανόντες διὰ τοὺς λίθους τῆς χαλάζης, ἢ οὓς ἀπέκτειναν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ μαχαίρᾳ ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ.
12 Τότε ἐλάλησεν
Ἰησοῦς πρὸς Κύριον, ἡ ἡμέρα (ἧ) παρέδωκε Κύριος (ὁ Θεὸς)
τὸν Ἀμοῤῥαῖον ὑποχείριον υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ, ἡνίκα συνέτριψεν αὐτοὺς
ἐν Γαβαὼν, καὶ συνετρίβησαν ἀπὸ προσώπου Ἰσραήλ· καὶ εἶπεν
Ἰησοῦς· στήτω ὁ ἥλιος κατὰ Γαβαὼν, καὶ ἡ σελήνη κατὰ φάραγγα
Αἰλών.

**Joshua 10**

<sup>1</sup> ...unto Joshua and unto Israel; and they were [now dwelling] among them.
<sup>2</sup> And they were sore afraid within themselves; for they knew that Gibeon was a great city, as it were, even one of the royal cities, and that it was greater than Ai, and all her men were mighty.
<sup>3</sup> Wherefore Adonibezek king of Jerusalem sent unto Ailam king of Hebron, and unto Pheram king of Jarmuth, and unto Jarie king of Lachish, and unto Dabir king of Adullam, saying:
<sup>4</sup> "Come up unto me, and help me, that we may make war against Gibeon; for they have defected unto Joshua and unto the children of Israel."
<sup>5</sup> So the five kings of the Jebusites gathered themselves together and went up—the king of Jerusalem, and the king of Hebron, and the king of Jarmuth, and the king of Lachish, and the king of Adullam—they and all their people; and they encamped against Gibeon, and laid siege unto it.
<sup>6</sup> And the inhabitants of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp of Israel to Gilgal, saying, "Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up unto us speedily, and save us, and help us; for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill country are gathered together against us."
<sup>7</sup> So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him, every mighty man of strength.
<sup>8</sup> And the Lord said unto Joshua, "Fear them not; for into thy hands have I delivered them; there shall no man of them stand before you."
<sup>9</sup> So Joshua came upon them suddenly; [for] all the night had Joshua marched from Gilgal.
<sup>10</sup> And the Lord discomfited them from before the face of Israel, and the Lord smote them with a great slaughter in Gibeon; and they pursued them along the way of the ascent of Beth-horon, and cut them down even unto Azekah and unto Makkedah.
<sup>11</sup> And it came to pass, as they fled from before the sons of Israel, upon the descent of Beth-horon, that the Lord cast down great stones of hail upon them from heaven even unto Azekah, and they died; and there were more who died by reason of the hailstones than those whom the sons of Israel slew with the sword in the battle.
<sup>12</sup> Then spake Joshua unto the Lord, on the day that the Lord (even God) delivered the Amorite into the hand of the sons of Israel, when He smote them in Gibeon, and they were smitten before the face of Israel; and Joshua said, "Let the sun stand still upon Gibeon, and the moon in the valley of Ailon."
