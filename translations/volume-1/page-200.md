ΚΕΦ Η´· ΛΕΥΙΤΙΚΟΝ 185

18 συνέταξε Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ. Καὶ προσήγαγε Μωυσῆς τὸν
κριὸν τὸν εἰς ὁλοκαύτωμα· καὶ ἐπέθηκεν Ἀαρὼν καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐ-
19 τοῦ τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν τοῦ κριοῦ. Καὶ ἔσφαξε
Μωυσῆς τὸν κριόν, καὶ προσέχεε Μωυσῆς τὸ αἷμα ἐπὶ τὸ θυσια-
20 στήριον κύκλῳ· καὶ τὸν κριὸν ἐκρεανόμησε κατὰ μέλη αὐτοῦ, καὶ
21 ἀνήνεγκε Μωυσῆς τὴν κεφαλήν, καὶ τὰ μέλη, καὶ τὸ στέαρ· καὶ
τὴν κοιλίαν, καὶ τοὺς πόδας ἔπλυνεν ὕδατι, καὶ ἀνήνεγκε Μωυ-
σῆς ὅλον τὸν κριὸν ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον ὁλοκαύτωμα (ὃ) ἐστιν
εἰς ὀσμὴν εὐωδίας· κάρπωμά ἐστι τῷ Κυρίῳ, καθάπερ ἐνετείλατο
22 Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ. Καὶ προσήγαγε Μωυσῆς τὸν κριὸν τὸν δεύ-
τερον, κριὸν τῆς τελειώσεως· καὶ ἐπέθηκεν Ἀαρὼν καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ
23 αὐτοῦ τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν τοῦ κριοῦ. Καὶ ἔσφα-
ξεν αὐτόν, καὶ ἔλαβε Μωυσῆς ἀπὸ τοῦ αἵματος αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπέθηκεν
ἐπὶ τὸν λοβὸν τοῦ ὠτὸς Ἀαρὼν τοῦ δεξιοῦ, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸ ἄκρον τῆς
χειρὸς αὐτοῦ τῆς δεξιᾶς, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸ ἄκρον τοῦ ποδὸς αὐτοῦ τοῦ
24 δεξιοῦ. Καὶ προσήγαγε Μωυσῆς τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἀαρών, καὶ ἐπέθηκε
Μωυσῆς ἀπὸ τοῦ αἵματος ἐπὶ τοὺς λοβοὺς τῶν ὤτων αὐτῶν τῶν
δεξιῶν, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ ἄκρα τῶν χειρῶν αὐτῶν τῶν δεξιῶν, καὶ ἐπὶ
τὰ ἄκρα τῶν ποδῶν αὐτῶν τῶν δεξιῶν· καὶ προσέχεε Μωυσῆς
25 τὸ αἷμα ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον κύκλῳ. Καὶ ἔλαβε τὸ στέαρ καὶ
τὴν ὀσφύν, καὶ πᾶν τὸ στέαρ τὸ ἐπὶ τῆς κοιλίας, καὶ τὸν λοβὸν
τοῦ ἤπατος, καὶ τοὺς δύο νεφρούς, καὶ τὸ στέαρ τὸ ἐπ᾽ αὐτῶν,
26 καὶ τὸν βραχίονα τὸν δεξιόν, καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ κανοῦ τῆς τελειώσεως,
τοῦ ὄντος ἔναντι Κυρίου, ἔλαβεν ἄρτον ἕνα ἄζυμον, καὶ ἄρτον
ἐξ ἐλαίου ἕνα, καὶ λάγανον ἕν, καὶ ἐπέθηκεν ἐπὶ τὸ στέαρ, καὶ
27 ἐπὶ τὸν βραχίονα τὸν δεξιόν. Καὶ ἐπέθηκεν ἅπαντα ἐπὶ τὰς χεῖ-
ρας Ἀαρών, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς χεῖρας τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀνήνεγκεν
28 αὐτὰ ἀφαίρεμα ἔναντι Κυρίου. Καὶ ἔλαβε Μωυσῆς ἀπὸ τῶν χει-
ρῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἀνήνεγκεν αὐτὰ Μωυσῆς ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον, ἐπὶ
τὸ ὁλοκαύτωμα τῆς τελειώσεως, ὃ ἐστιν ὀσμὴ εὐωδίας· κάρπωμά
29 ἐστι τῷ Κυρίῳ. Καὶ λαβὼν Μωυσῆς τὸ στηθύνιον, ἀφεῖλεν αὐτὸ
ἐπίθεμα ἔναντι Κυρίου, ἀπὸ τοῦ κριοῦ τῆς τελειώσεως· καὶ ἐγένε-
30 το Μωυσῇ ἐν μερίδι, καθὰ ἐνετείλατο Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ. Καὶ
ἔλαβε Μωυσῆς ἀπὸ τοῦ ἐλαίου τῆς χρίσεως, καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ αἵμα-
τος τοῦ ἐπὶ τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου, καὶ προσέρρανεν ἐπὶ Ἀαρών, καὶ
τὰς στολὰς αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ (μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ), καὶ τὰς

**Chapter 8**

**17**
...the LORD commanded Moses.

**18**
And Moses brought forth the ram, the one appointed for the burnt offering; and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.

**19**
And Moses slew the ram; and Moses poured the blood upon the altar round about.

**20**
And he dismembered the ram by its pieces,

**21**
And Moses bore up the head, and the pieces, and the fat; and the entrails and the feet did he wash with water. And Moses bore up the whole ram upon the altar for a burnt offering, [which is] for a savor of sweet aroma; it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD, as the LORD commanded Moses.

**22**
And Moses brought forth the second ram, the ram of consecration; and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.

**23**
And he slew it; and Moses took of its blood and put it upon the lobe of Aaron’s right ear, and upon the tip of his right hand, and upon the tip of his right foot.

**24**
And Moses brought forth the sons of Aaron; and Moses put of the blood upon the lobes of their right ears, and upon the tips of their right hands, and upon the tips of their right feet. And Moses poured the blood upon the altar round about.

**25**
And he took the fat and the fatty tail, and all the fat that was upon the entrails, and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder;

**26**
And from the basket of consecration, which was before the LORD, he took one unleavened loaf, and one loaf made with oil, and one wafer; and he put them upon the fat, and upon the right shoulder.

**27**
And he put all these upon the hands of Aaron and upon the hands of his sons; and he waved them as a wave offering before the LORD.

**28**
And Moses took them from their hands, and Moses brought them up upon the altar, upon the burnt offering of consecration, which is a savor of sweet aroma; it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

**29**
And Moses took the breast, [and] separated it as a wave offering before the LORD, from the ram of consecration; and it became Moses' portion, as the LORD commanded Moses.

**30**
And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons (with him), and upon the [garments of his sons].
