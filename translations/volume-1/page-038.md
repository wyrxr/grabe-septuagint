ΚΕΦ. ΙΕ΄.
9 αἶγα τριετίζουσαν, καὶ κριὸν τριετίζοντα, καὶ τρυγόνα, καὶ περιστεράν.
10 Ἔλαβε δὲ αὐτῷ πάντα ταῦτα, καὶ διεῖλεν αὐτὰ μέσα, καὶ ἔθηκεν αὐτὰ ἀντιπρόσωπα ἀλλήλοις· τὰ δὲ ὄρνεα οὐ διεῖλε.
11 Κατέβη δὲ ὄρνεα ἐπὶ τὰ σώματα, τὰ διχοτομήματα αὐτῶν· καὶ συνεκάθισεν αὐτοῖς Ἄβραμ.
12 Περὶ δὲ ἡλίου δυσμὰς ἔκστασις ἐπέπεσε τῷ Ἄβραμ, καὶ ἰδοὺ φόβος σκοτεινὸς μέγας ἐκπίπτει αὐτῷ.
13 Καὶ ἐῤῥέθη πρὸς Ἄβραμ· γινώσκων γνώσῃ ὅτι πάροικον ἔσται τὸ σπέρμα σου ἐν γῇ οὐκ ἰδίᾳ, καὶ κακώσουσιν αὐτό, καὶ δουλώσουσιν αὐτούς, καὶ ταπεινώσουσιν αὐτοὺς τετρακόσια ἔτη.
14 Τὸ δὲ ἔθνος ᾧ ἐὰν δουλεύσωσι, κρινῶ ἐγώ· μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα ἐξελεύσονται ὧδε μετὰ ἀποσκευῆς πολλῆς.
15 Σὺ δὲ ἀπελεύσῃ πρὸς τοὺς πατέρας σου μετ᾽ εἰρήνης, ταφεὶς ἐν γήρει καλῷ.
16 Τετάρτῃ δὲ γενεᾷ ἀποστραφήσονται ὧδε· οὔπω γὰρ ἀναπεπλήρωνται αἱ ἁμαρτίαι τῶν Ἀμοῤῥαίων ἕως τοῦ νῦν.
17 Ἐπεὶ δὲ ἐγένετο ὁ ἥλιος πρὸς δυσμάς, φλὸξ ἐγένετο· καὶ ἰδοὺ κλίβανος καπνιζόμενος καὶ λαμπάδες πυρός, αἳ διῆλθον ἀνὰ μέσον τῶν διχοτομημάτων τούτων.
18 Ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ διέθετο Κύριος τῷ Ἄβραμ διαθήκην, λέγων· τῷ σπέρματί σου δώσω τὴν γῆν ταύτην, ἀπὸ τοῦ ποταμοῦ Αἰγύπτου ἕως τοῦ ποταμοῦ τοῦ μεγάλου Εὐφράτου·
19 τοὺς Κεναίους, καὶ τοὺς Κενεζαίους, καὶ τοὺς Κεδμωναίους,
20 καὶ τοὺς Χετταίους, καὶ τοὺς Φερεζαίους, καὶ τοὺς Ῥαφαείν, καὶ τοὺς Ἀμοῤῥαίους,
21 καὶ τοὺς Χαναναίους, (καὶ τοὺς Εὐαίους,) καὶ τοὺς Γεργεσαίους, καὶ τοὺς Ἰεβουσαίους.

ΚΕΦ. ΙϚ΄.
1 ΣΑΡΑ δὲ ἡ γυνὴ Ἄβραμ οὐκ ἔτικτεν αὐτῷ· ἦν δὲ αὐτῇ παιδίσκη Αἰγυπτία, ᾗ ὄνομα Ἄγαρ.
2 Εἶπε δὲ Σάρα πρὸς Ἄβραμ. Ἰδοὺ συνέκλεισέ με Κύριος, τοῦ μὴ τίκτειν· εἴσελθε οὖν πρὸς τὴν παιδίσκην μου, ἵνα τεκνοποιήσω ἐξ αὐτῆς· ὑπήκουσε δὲ Ἄβραμ τῆς φωνῆς Σάρας.
3 Καὶ λαβοῦσα Σάρα ἡ γυνὴ Ἄβραμ Ἄγαρ τὴν Αἰγυπτίαν τὴν ἑαυτῆς παιδίσκην, μετὰ δέκα ἔτη τοῦ οἰκῆσαι Ἄβραμ ἐν γῇ Χαναάν, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὴν τῷ Ἄβραμ ἀνδρὶ αὐτῆς αὐτῷ γυναῖκα.
4 Καὶ εἰσῆλθε πρὸς Ἄγαρ, καὶ συνέλαβε· καὶ ἴδεν ὅτι ἐν γαστρὶ ἔχει, καὶ ἠτιμάσθη ἡ κυρία ἐναντίον αὐτῆς.
5 Εἶπε δὲ Σάρα πρὸς Ἄβραμ· ἀδικοῦμαι ἐκ σου. Ἐγὼ ἔδωκα τὴν παιδίσκην

#### Chapter 15

9 [Take] a three-year-old she-goat, and a three-year-old ram, and a turtledove, and a pigeon.
10 And he took all these unto him, and divided them in the midst, and set them each over against the other; but the birds he divided not.
11 And birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, the divided pieces thereof; and Abram sat down by them.
12 And as the sun was setting, a deep trance fell upon Abram; and behold, a great and dark dread overwhelmed him.
13 And it was said unto Abram, "Know this for certain, that your seed shall be sojourners in a land not their own, and they shall afflict them, and they shall enslave them, and they shall humble them for four hundred years.
14 And the nation whom they shall serve, I will judge; and after these things shall they go forth hence with much baggage.
15 But as for you, you shall go unto your fathers in peace, buried in a good old age.
16 But in the fourth generation shall they return hither; for the iniquities of the Amorites are not yet full even until now."
17 And when the sun was toward the setting, a flame appeared; and behold, a smoking furnace and lamps of fire, which passed through the midst of these divided pieces.
18 On that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, "Unto your seed will I give this land, from the river of Egypt even unto the great river Euphrates:
19 the Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,
20 and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaim, and the Amorites,
21 and the Canaanites, (and the Hivites,) and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites."

#### Chapter 16

1 Now Sarai, Abram's wife, bore him no children; and she had an Egyptian handmaid, whose name was Hagar.
2 And Sarai said unto Abram, "Behold now, the Lord has shut me up, that I bear not; go in, I pray you, unto my handmaid; perhaps I may obtain children by her." And Abram hearkened unto the voice of Sarai.
3 And Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar her Egyptian handmaid, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband, [even] to him for a wife.
4 And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
5 And Sarai said unto Abram, "My wrong is upon you. I have given my handmaid
