ποιεῖν πάντα τὰ ἔργα τὰ κατὰ τὰ ἅγια τὰ καθήκοντα, κατὰ πάντα ὅσα συνέταξε Κύριος. Καὶ ἐκάλεσε Μωυσῆς τὸν Βεσελεὴλ καὶ 2
Ἐλιάβ, καὶ πάντας τοὺς ἔχοντας τὴν σοφίαν, ᾧ ἔδωκεν ὁ Θεὸς
ἐπιστήμην ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ, καὶ πάντας τοὺς ἑκουσίως βουλομένους
προσπορεύεσθαι πρὸς τὰ ἔργα, ὥστε συντελεῖν αὐτά· καὶ ἔλαβον 3
παρὰ Μωυσῆ πάντα τὰ ἀφαιρέματα, ἃ ἤνεγκαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ
εἰς πάντα τὰ ἔργα τοῦ ἁγίου, ποιεῖν αὐτά· καὶ αὐτοὶ προσεδέ-
χοντο ἔτι τὰ προσφερόμενα παρὰ τῶν φερόντων τὸ πρωὶ πρωΐ.
Καὶ παραγενόμενοι πάντες οἱ σοφοὶ οἱ ποιοῦντες πάντα τὰ ἔργα 4
τοῦ ἁγίου, ἕκαστος κατὰ τὸ αὑτοῦ ἔργον ὃ αὐτοὶ εἰργάζοντο, καὶ 5
εἶπαν πρὸς Μωυσῆν, λέγοντες· ὅτι πλῆθος φέρει ὁ λαὸς παρὰ τὰ
ἔργα, ὅσα συνέταξε Κύριος ποιῆσαι. Καὶ προσέταξε Μωυσῆς, καὶ 6
ἐκήρυξεν ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ, λέγων· ἀνὴρ καὶ γυνὴ μηκέτι ἐργαζέσθωσαν εἰς τὰς ἀπαρχὰς τοῦ ἁγίου· καὶ ἐκωλύθη ὁ λαὸς ἔτι προσ-
φέρειν. Καὶ τὰ ἔργα ἱκανὰ ἦν αὐτοῖς εἰς τὴν κατασκευήν, ποιῆσαι 7
αὐτά· καὶ προσκατέλιπον. Καὶ ἐποίησαν πᾶς σοφὸς τῇ διανοίᾳ ἐν 8
τοῖς ἐργαζομένοις τὰς στολὰς τῶν ἁγίων, αἵ εἰσιν Ἀαρὼν τῷ ἱερεῖ, καθὰ συνέταξε Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῆ. Καὶ ἐποίησαν τὴν ἐπω-
μίδα ἐκ χρυσίου, καὶ ὑακίνθου, καὶ πορφύρας, καὶ κοκκίνου νενησμένου, καὶ βύσσου κεκλωσμένης· καὶ ἐτμήθη τὰ πέταλα τοῦ
χρυσίου τρίχες, ὥστε συνυφαίναι σὺν τῇ ὑακίνθῳ, καὶ τῇ πορφύρᾳ,
καὶ σὺν τῷ κοκκίνῳ τῷ διανενησμένῳ, καὶ σὺν τῇ βύσσῳ τῇ κεκλωσμένῃ, ἔργον ὑφαντόν· ἐποίησαν αὐτῷ ἐπωμίδας συνεχοῦσας
ἐξ ἀμφοτέρων τῶν μερῶν αὐτοῦ, ἔργον ὑφαντὸν εἰς ἄλληλα συμ-
πεπλεγμένον καθ᾽ ἑαυτό, ἐξ αὐτοῦ ἐποίησαν ἐκ χρυσίου, καὶ ὑακίνθου, καὶ πορφύρας, καὶ κοκκίνου διανενησμένου, καὶ βύσσου κεκλωσμένῃ, καθὰ συνέταξε Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῆ. Καὶ ἐποίησαν ἀμ-
φοτέρους τοὺς λίθους τῆς σμαράγδου συμπεπορπημένους καὶ
περισεσιαλωμένους χρυσίῳ, γεγλυμμένους καὶ ἐκκεκολαμμένους
ἐκκόλαμμα σφραγῖδος, ἐκ τῶν ὀνομάτων τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ· καὶ
ἐπέθηκεν αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ τοὺς ὤμους τῆς ἐπωμίδος, λίθους μνημοσύ-
νου τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, καθὰ συνέταξε Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῆ. Καὶ
ἐποίησε τὸ λογεῖον, ἔργον ὑφαντὸν ποικιλίας, κατὰ τὸ ἔργον τῆς
ἐπωμίδος, ἐκ χρυσίου, καὶ ὑακίνθου, καὶ πορφύρας, καὶ κοκκίνου
διανενησμένου, καὶ βύσσου κεκλωσμένης· τετράγωνον διπλοῦν ἐποίη-
σαν τὸ λογεῖον· σπιθαμῆς τὸ μῆκος αὐτοῦ, καὶ σπιθαμῆς τὸ εὖρος

**CHAPTER 36**

¹ to perform all the works that pertain unto the holy [things which are] meet, according to all that the Lord had commanded.
² And Moses called Bezaleel and Eliab, and all those who possessed wisdom, to whom God had given understanding in the heart; and all those who were of a willing mind to draw near unto the works, that they might complete them.
³ And they received from Moses all the heave offerings, which the children of Israel had brought for all the work of the sanctuary, to make the same. And they themselves continued still to receive that which was offered by them that brought it morning by morning.
⁴ Then all the wise men who wrought all the work of the sanctuary came, each one from his own work which they were making,
⁵ and spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring a superabundance beyond the work which the Lord commanded to make.
⁶ And Moses commanded, and caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman perform any more work for the offerings of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing further.
⁷ For the materials were sufficient for them for all the construction, to make it; yea, and [there was] even an abundance remaining.
⁸ And every wise-hearted man among them that wrought made the holy garments, which were for Aaron the priest, according as the Lord had commanded Moses.
⁹ And they made the ephod of gold, and of hyacinth, and of purple, and of spun scarlet, and of fine twined linen;
¹⁰ and the plates of gold were cut into threads, so as to be woven together with the hyacinth, and with the purple, and with the double-spun scarlet, and with the fine twined linen, a woven work.
¹¹ They made for it shoulderpieces joining it on both its sides, a woven work intricately intertwined within itself; from the same they made it of gold, and of hyacinth, and of purple, and of double-spun scarlet, and of fine twined linen, even as the Lord had commanded Moses.
¹² And they made both the emerald stones, set in their clasps and encased with gold, graven and carved with a seal-engraving, with the names of the children of Israel;
¹³ and he placed them upon the shoulders of the ephod, [to be] stones of memorial for the children of Israel, even as the Lord had commanded Moses.
¹⁴ And he made the breastplate, a work of cunning artistry, after the fashion of the work of the ephod; of gold, and of hyacinth, and of purple, and of double-spun scarlet, and of fine twined linen.
¹⁵ Foursquare and double they made the breastplate; a span was the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof.
