ΚΕΦ. ΛΑʹ. ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ 55
ἡμῖν ἔσται καὶ τοῖς τέκνοις ἡμῶν· νῦν οὖν ὅσα εἴρηκεν ὁ Θεός
σοι, ποίει. Ἀναστὰς δὲ Ἰακώβ, ἔλαβε τὰς γυναῖκας αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰ 17
παιδία αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὰς καμήλους· καὶ ἀπήγαγε πάντα τὰ ὑπάρ- 18
χοντα αὐτοῦ, καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν ἀποσκευὴν αὐτοῦ, ἣν περιεποίησατο
ἐν τῇ Μεσοποταμίᾳ, καὶ πάντα τὰ αὐτοῦ, ἀπελθεῖν πρὸς Ἰσαὰκ
τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ εἰς γῆν Χαναάν. Λάβαν δὲ ᾤχετο κεῖραι τὰ 19
πρόβατα αὐτοῦ· ἔκλεψε δὲ Ῥαχὴλ τὰ εἴδωλα τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῆς.
Ἔκλεψε δὲ Ἰακὼβ Λάβαν τὸν Σύρον, τοῦ μὴ ἀναγγεῖλαι αὐτῷ, 20
ὅτι ἀποδιδράσκει. Καὶ ἀπέδρα αὐτός, καὶ πάντα τὰ αὐτοῦ· καὶ 21
ἀνέστη, καὶ διέβη τὸν ποταμόν, καὶ ὥρμησεν εἰς τὸ ὄρος Γα-
λαάδ. Ἀνηγγέλη δὲ Λάβαν τῷ Σύρῳ τῇ τρίτῃ ἡμέρᾳ, ὅτι ἀπέδρα 22
Ἰακώβ. Καὶ παραλαβὼν πάντας τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ μεθ᾽ ἑαυτοῦ, 23
ἐδίωξεν ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ ὁδὸν ἡμερῶν ἑπτά· καὶ κατέλαβεν αὐτὸν ἐν
τῷ ὄρει Γαλαάδ. Ἦλθε δὲ ὁ Θεὸς πρὸς Λάβαν τὸν Σύρον καθ᾽ 24
ὕπνον τὴν νύκτα, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· φύλαξαι σεαυτὸν μή ποτε λα-
λήσῃς μετὰ Ἰακὼβ πονηρά. Καὶ κατέλαβε Λάβαν τὸν Ἰακώβ. Ἰα- 25
κὼβ δὲ ἔπηξε τὴν σκηνὴν αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ ὄρει· Λάβαν δὲ ἔστησε τοὺς
ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ ὄρει Γαλαάδ. Εἶπε δὲ Λάβαν τῷ Ἰακώβ· 26
τί ἐποίησας; ἵνατι κρυφῇ ἀπέδρας, καὶ ἐκλοποφόρησάς με, καὶ
ἀπήγαγες τὰς θυγατέρας μου, ὡς αἰχμαλωτίδας μαχαίρᾳ; Καὶ 27
εἰ ἀπήγγειλάς μοι, ἐξαπέστειλα ἄν σε μετ᾽ εὐφροσύνης, καὶ μετὰ
μουσικῶν, καὶ τυμπάνων, καὶ κιθάρας. Καὶ οὐκ ἠξιώθην κατα- 28
φιλῆσαι τὰ παιδία μου, καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας μου· νῦν δὲ ἀφρόνως
ἔπραξας. Καὶ νῦν ἰσχύει ἡ χείρ μου κακοποιῆσαί σε· ὁ δὲ Θεὸς 29
τοῦ πατρός σου ἐχθὲς εἶπε πρός με, λέγων· φύλαξαι σεαυτὸν μή
ποτε λαλήσῃς μετὰ Ἰακὼβ πονηρά. Νῦν οὖν πεπόρευμαι· ἐπιθυ- 30
μία γὰρ ἐπεθύμησας εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ πατρός σου ἀπελθεῖν. Καὶ 31
ἵνατι ἔκλεψας τοὺς θεούς μου; Ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ Ἰακώβ, εἶπε τῷ
Λάβαν· ὅτι ἐφοβήθην· εἶπα γάρ, μή ποτε ἀφέλῃς τὰς θυγατέρας
σου ἀπ᾽ ἐμοῦ, καὶ πάντα τὰ ἐμά. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Ἰακώβ· παρ᾽ 32
ᾧ ἐὰν εὕρῃς τοὺς θεούς σου, οὐ ζήσεται· ἐναντίον τῶν ἀδελφῶν
ἡμῶν ἐπίγνωθι τί ἐστι τῶν σῶν παρ᾽ ἐμοί, καὶ λάβε· καὶ οὐκ ἐπέ-
γνω παρ᾽ αὐτῷ οὐθέν. Οὐκ ᾔδει δὲ Ἰακώβ, ὅτι Ῥαχὴλ ἡ γυνὴ
αὐτοῦ ἔκλεψεν αὐτούς. Εἰσελθὼν δὲ Λάβαν, ἠρεύνησεν εἰς τὸν οἶ- 33
κον Λείας, καὶ οὐχ εὗρε· καὶ ἐξελθὼν ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου Λείας, ἠρεύ-
νησεν εἰς τὸν οἶκον Ἰακώβ, καὶ ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τῶν δύο παιδισκῶν,

**Chapter 31**

16 Unto us shall it be, and unto our children. Now therefore, whatsoever the Lord hath spoken unto thee, do thou.

17 And Jacob rose up, and took his wives and his children upon the camels; 18 and he led away all his substance, and all his baggage which he had acquired in Mesopotamia, and all that was his, to go unto Isaac his father into the land of Canaan.

19 Now Laban had gone to shear his sheep: and Rachel stole the idols of her father.

20 And Jacob stole away from Laban the Syrian, without telling him that he did flee. 21 So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.

22 And it was told Laban the Syrian on the third day that Jacob was fled. 23 And he took all his brethren with him, and pursued after him a journey of seven days; and he overtook him in the mount Gilead.

24 And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed to thyself that thou speak not to Jacob aught evil.

25 Then Laban overtook Jacob. And Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount; and Laban pitched his brethren in the mount Gilead.

26 And Laban said unto Jacob, What is this that thou hast done, that thou hast fled away privily, and hast stolen away from me, and hast carried away my daughters as captives taken with the sword?

27 And hadst thou but told me, I would have sent thee forth with joy, and with musical [instruments], and with timbrels, and with harps. 28 Neither was I counted worthy to kiss my children and my daughters; now therefore hast thou done foolishly.

29 And now, truly, the power of my hand might do thee evil; but the God of thy father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take heed to thyself that thou speak not to Jacob aught evil.

30 And now, forasmuch as I am come [unto thee, because] thou didst greatly desire to depart unto thy father’s house, 31 wherefore then hast thou stolen my gods?

32 And Jacob answered and said unto Laban, Because I was afraid; for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take away thy daughters from me, and all that is mine. And Jacob said unto him, With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, he shall not live. Before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take [it]. But he discerned nothing of his own with Jacob.

33 Now Jacob knew not that Rachel his wife had stolen them. And Laban entered into the tent of Leah, and found [them] not; and he went out from the tent of Leah, and searched the tent of Jacob, and in the tent of the two maidservants,
