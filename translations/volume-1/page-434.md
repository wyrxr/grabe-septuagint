τέρες ἡμῶν, οὐχ ἕνεκεν καρπωμάτων, οὐδὲ ἕνεκεν θυσιῶν, ἀλλὰ
μαρτύριόν ἐστιν ἀναμέσον ἡμῶν καὶ ἀναμέσον ὑμῶν, καὶ ἀναμέσον
τῶν τέκνων ἡμῶν. Μὴ γένοιτο οὖν ἡμᾶς ἀποστῆναι 29
ἀπὸ Κυρίου ἐν τῇ σήμερον ἡμέρᾳ, ὥστε ἀποστραφῆναι ἀπὸ Κυρίου,
ὥστε οἰκοδομῆσαι ἡμᾶς θυσιαστήριον τοῖς καρπώμασι καὶ
ταῖς θυσίαις (Σαλαμὶν) καὶ τῇ θυσίᾳ τῶν σωτηρίων πλὴν τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου
Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν, ὃ ἔστιν ἀπεναντίον τῆς σκηνῆς
αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἀκούσαντες Φινεὲς ὁ ἱερεὺς καὶ πάντες οἱ ἄρχοντες 30
τῆς συναγωγῆς καὶ οἱ χιλιάρχοι Ἰσραὴλ οἱ ἦσαν μετ’ αὐτοῦ,
τοὺς λόγους οὓς ἐλάλησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ῥουβὴν καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Γὰδ
καὶ οἱ ἡμίσεις φυλῆς Μανασσῆ, καὶ ἤρεσεν αὐτοῖς. Καὶ εἶπε Φινεὲς 31
υἱὸς Ἐλεάζαρ ὁ ἱερεὺς τοῖς υἱοῖς Ῥουβὴν καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς Γὰδ
καὶ ἡμίσει φυλῆς Μανασσῆ· σήμερον ἐγνώκαμεν ὅτι μεθ’ ἡμῶν
Κύριος, διότι οὐκ ἐπλημμελήσατε ἐναντίον Κυρίου πλημμέλειαν
ταύτην, καὶ ὅτι ἐρύσασθε τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ ἐκ χειρὸς Κυρίου.
Καὶ ἀπέστρεψε Φινεὲς υἱὸς Ἐλεάζαρ ὁ ἱερεὺς καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες (τῶν 32
πατριῶν) ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν Ῥουβὴν καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν Γὰδ (καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ
ἡμίσους φυλῆς Μανασσῆ) ἐκ γῆς Γαλαὰδ εἰς γῆν Χαναάν, πρὸς
τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραήλ· καὶ ἀπεκρίθησαν αὐτοῖς τοὺς λόγους. Καὶ 33
ἤρεσεν ὁ λόγος τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ εὐλόγησαν τὸν Θεὸν υἱῶν
Ἰσραήλ· καὶ ἐλάλησαν πρὸς τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ εἶπαν μηκέτι
ἀναβῆναι πρὸς αὐτοὺς εἰς πόλεμον, ἐξολοθρεῦσαι τὴν γῆν τῶν υἱῶν
Ῥουβὴν, καὶ τῶν υἱῶν Γὰδ, (καὶ τοῦ ἡμίσους φυλῆς Μανασσῆ)·
καὶ κατώκησεν ἐπ’ αὐτῆς. Καὶ ἐπωνόμασεν Ἰησοῦς τὸν βωμὸν τῷ 34
Ῥουβὴν καὶ τῷ Γὰδ (καὶ τῷ ἡμίσει φυλῆς Μανασσῆ,) καὶ εἶπεν,
ὅτι μαρτύριόν ἐστιν ἀναμέσον αὐτῶν, ὅτι Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς (Θεὸς)
αὐτῶν ἐστι.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΓ'. ΧΧΙΙΙ.

ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο μετὰ ἡμέρας πλείους, μετὰ τὸ καταπαῦσαι Κύριον 1
τὸν (Θεὸν) Ἰσραὴλ ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν ἐχθρῶν αὐτῶν κυκλόθεν,
καὶ Ἰησοῦς πρεσβύτερος προβεβηκὼς ἡμέραις· καὶ συνεκάλεσεν 2
Ἰησοῦς πάντας τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ καὶ τὴν γερουσίαν αὐτῶν καὶ τοὺς
ἄρχοντας αὐτῶν καὶ τοὺς δικαστὰς αὐτῶν καὶ τοὺς γραμματεῖς
αὐτῶν, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· ἐγὼ γεγήρακα, καὶ προέβηκα ταῖς ἡμέραις.

**Joshua 22**
<sup>28</sup> —which our fathers made—not for the sake of burnt offerings, nor for the sake of sacrifices, but that it is a witness between us and between you, and between our children.
<sup>29</sup> Far be it then from us to depart from the LORD this day, so as to turn away from the LORD, and to build us an altar for burnt offerings and for sacrifices, [even] peace offerings, and for the sacrifice of peace offerings, other than the altar of the LORD our God, which is before His tabernacle.
<sup>30</sup> And when Phinehas the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, and the captains of thousands of Israel who were with him, heard the words which the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh spake, it pleased them.
<sup>31</sup> And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, "This day do we know that the LORD is with us, because ye have not committed this trespass against the LORD, and because ye have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the LORD."
<sup>32</sup> And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes [of the fathers], returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, (and from the half tribe of Manasseh,) from the land of Gilead unto the land of Canaan, unto the children of Israel; and they reported unto them the words.
<sup>33</sup> And the word pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed the God of Israel; and they spake unto the children of Israel, and said that they would no longer go up against them to war, to destroy the land of the children of Reuben, and of the children of Gad, (and of the half tribe of Manasseh); and he dwelt upon it.
<sup>34</sup> And Joshua named the altar for Reuben and for Gad (and for the half tribe of Manasseh), and said, "For it is a witness between them, that the LORD, the God—(God)—of them, He is."

**Joshua 23**
<sup>1</sup> And it came to pass a long time after, that the LORD [God] had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about, and Joshua was old and well stricken in years.
<sup>2</sup> And Joshua called for all the children of Israel, and for their elders, and for their rulers, and for their judges, and for their scribes, and said unto them, "I am grown old, and am advanced in days."
