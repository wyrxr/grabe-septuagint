20 χῆλ, γυναικὸς Ἰακώβ· Ἰωσήφ, καὶ Βενιαμίν. Ἐγένοντο δὲ υἱοὶ Ἰωσὴφ ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ, οὓς ἔτεκεν αὐτῷ Ἀσεννέθ, θυγάτηρ Πετεφρῆ, ἱερέως Ἡλιουπόλεως, τὸν Μανασσῆ, καὶ τὸν Ἐφραίμ. Ἐγένοντο δὲ υἱοὶ Μανασσῆ, οὓς ἔτεκεν αὐτῷ ἡ παλλακὴ ἡ Σύρα, τὸν Μαχείρ· Μαχεὶρ δὲ ἐγέννησε τὸν Γαλαάδ. Υἱοὶ δὲ Ἐφραίμ, ἀδελφοῦ Μανασσῆ· Σουταλαάμ, καὶ Ταάμ· υἱοὶ δὲ Σουταλαάμ· Ἑδέμ. Υἱοὶ δὲ Βενιαμίν· Βαλά, καὶ Βοχόρ, καὶ Ἀσβήλ.
21 Ἐγένοντο δὲ υἱοὶ Βαλά· Γηρά, καὶ Ναεμάν, καὶ Ἀγγεῖς, καὶ Ῥῶς, καὶ Μαμφείμ, καὶ Ὀριμίν· Γηρὰ δὲ ἐγέννησε τὸν Ἀράδ.
22 Οὗτοι υἱοὶ Ῥαχήλ, οὓς ἔτεκε τῷ Ἰακώβ, πᾶσαι ψυχαὶ δεκαοκτώ.
23 Υἱοὶ δὲ Δάν· Ἀσόμ.
24 Καὶ υἱοὶ Νεφθαλί· Ἀσιήλ, καὶ Γωνί, καὶ Ἰσσάκαρ, καὶ Συλλήμ.
25 Οὗτοι υἱοὶ Βαλλᾶς, ἣν ἔδωκε Λάβαν Ῥαχὴλ τῇ θυγατρὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔτεκε τούτους τῷ Ἰακώβ· πᾶσαι ψυχαὶ ἑπτά.
26 Πᾶσαι δὲ ψυχαὶ αἱ εἰσελθοῦσαι μετὰ Ἰακὼβ εἰς Αἴγυπτον, οἱ ἐξελθόντες ἐκ τῶν μηρῶν αὐτοῦ, χωρὶς τῶν γυναικῶν υἱῶν Ἰακώβ, πᾶσαι ψυχαί, ἑξηκονταέξ·
27 υἱοὶ δὲ Ἰωσὴφ οἱ γενόμενοι αὐτῷ ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ, ψυχαὶ ἐννέα· πᾶσαι ψυχαὶ οἴκου Ἰακὼβ αἱ εἰσελθοῦσαι εἰς Αἴγυπτον, ἑβδομήκοντα πέντε.
28 Τὸν δὲ Ἰούδαν ἀπέστειλεν ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ πρὸς Ἰωσήφ, συναντῆσαι αὐτῷ καθ᾽ ἡρώων πόλιν, εἰς γῆν Ῥαμεσσῆ.
29 Ζεῦξας δὲ Ἰωσὴφ τὰ ἅρματα αὐτοῦ, ἀνέβη εἰς συνάντησιν Ἰσραὴλ τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ καθ᾽ ἡρώων πόλιν· καὶ ὀφθεὶς αὐτῷ, ἐπέπεσεν ἐπὶ τὸν τράχηλον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔκλαυσε κλαυθμῷ πλείονι.
30 Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς Ἰωσήφ· ἀποθανοῦμαι ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν, ἐπεὶ ἑώρακα τὸ πρόσωπόν σου· ἔτι γὰρ σὺ ζῇς.
31 Εἶπε δὲ Ἰωσὴφ πρὸς τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ· ἀναβὰς ἀπαγγελῶ τῷ Φαραώ, καὶ ἐρῶ αὐτῷ· οἱ ἀδελφοί μου, καὶ ὁ οἶκος τοῦ πατρός μου, οἳ ἦσαν ἐν γῇ Χαναάν, ἥκασι πρός με.
32 Οἱ δὲ ἄνδρες εἰσὶ ποιμένες· ἄνδρες γὰρ κτηνοτρόφοι ἦσαν, καὶ τὰ κτήνη καὶ τοὺς βόας καὶ πάντα τὰ αὐτῶν ἀνηνόχασιν.
33 Ἐὰν οὖν καλέσῃ ὑμᾶς Φαραώ, καὶ εἴπῃ ὑμῖν· τί τὸ ἔργον ὑμῶν;
34 ἐρεῖτε· ἄνδρες κτηνοτρόφοι οἱ παῖδές σου ἐσμὲν ἐκ παιδὸς ἕως τοῦ νῦν, καὶ ἡμεῖς, καὶ οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν· ἵνα κατοικήσητε ἐν γῇ Γεσὲν Ἀραβίᾳ. Βδέλυγμα γάρ ἐστι τοῖς Αἰγυπτίοις πᾶς ποιμὴν προβάτων.

**Chapter XLVII.**

20 Rachel, the wife of Jacob: Joseph, and Benjamin. And the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in the land of Egypt, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of Heliopolis, bore unto him: Manasseh, and Ephraim. And the sons of Manasseh, whom his Syrian concubine bore unto him: Machir. And Machir begat Gilead. And the sons of Ephraim, Manasseh’s brother: Shuthelah, and Taham. And the sons of Shuthelah: Edem. And the sons of Benjamin: Bela, and Becher, and Ashbel.
21 And the sons of Bela: Gera, and Naaman, and Agges, and Ros, and Mamphim, and Orimin. And Gera begat Arad.
22 These are the sons of Rachel, whom she bore unto Jacob; all souls, eighteen.
23 And the sons of Dan: Ashom.
24 And the sons of Naphtali: Ashiel, and Guni, and Issachar, and Shillem.
25 These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to Rachel his daughter; and she bore these unto Jacob; all souls, seven.
26 And all the souls who came with Jacob into Egypt, who came forth from his loins, apart from the wives of Jacob’s sons, all souls, sixty-six.
27 And the sons of Joseph who were born to him in the land of Egypt, nine souls. All the souls of the house of Jacob who came into Egypt, seventy-five.
28 And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to meet him in the city of Heroes, into the land of Rameses.
29 And Joseph made ready his chariots, and went up to meet Israel his father in the city of Heroes. And when he appeared unto him, he fell upon his neck, and wept with much weeping.
30 And Israel said unto Joseph: Now will I die, since I have seen thy face; for thou art yet alive.
31 And Joseph said unto his brethren: I will go up and tell Pharaoh, and say unto him: My brethren, and my father's house, who were in the land of Canaan, have come unto me.
32 And these men are shepherds; for they were herdsmen, and they have brought their flocks and their cattle, and all that they have.
33 Therefore, if Pharaoh shall call you, and say unto you: What is your occupation?
34 Ye shall say: Thy servants are herdsmen from our youth even until now, both we and our fathers; that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen of Arabia. For every shepherd of sheep is an abomination unto the Egyptians.
