**16.** ὁ ἄγγελος Κυρίου· ἔτι Κύριος ἔσται μετὰ σοῦ, καὶ πατάξεις τὴν Μαδιὰμ ὡσεὶ ἄνδρα ἕνα.
**17.** Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτὸν Γεδεών· καὶ εἰ εὗρον χάριν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς σου, καὶ ποιήσεις μοι σημεῖον ὅτι σὺ λαλεῖς μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ·
**18.** μὴ δὴ κινηθῇς ἐντεῦθεν, ἕως τοῦ ἐλθεῖν με πρὸς σε, καὶ οἴσω τὴν θυσίαν μου, καὶ θήσω ἐνώπιον σου. Καὶ εἶπεν· ἐγώ εἰμι, καθήσομαι ἕως τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι σε.
**19.** Καὶ Γεδεὼν εἰσῆλθε, καὶ ἐποίησεν ἔριφον αἰγῶν καὶ οἰφὶ ἀλεύρου ἀζύμοις, καὶ τὰ κρέα ἐπέθηκεν ἐπὶ τὸ κανοῦν, καὶ τὸν ζωμὸν ἐνέχεεν εἰς χύτραν· καὶ ἐξήνεγκε πρὸς αὐτὸν ὑπὸ τὴν δρῦν, καὶ προσεκύνησε.
**20.** Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτὸν ὁ ἄγγελος Κυρίου· λάβε τὰ κρέα καὶ τοὺς ἄρτους τοὺς ἀζύμους, καὶ θὲς πρὸς τὴν πέτραν ἐκείνην, καὶ τὸν ζωμὸν ἔκχεον· καὶ ἐποίησεν οὕτως.
**21.** Καὶ ἐξέτεινεν ὁ ἄγγελος Κυρίου τὸ ἄκρον τῆς ῥάβδου τῆς ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἥψατο τῶν κρεῶν καὶ τῶν ἀζύμων· καὶ ἀνήφθη πῦρ ἐκ τῆς πέτρας, καὶ κατέφαγε τὰ κρέα καὶ τοὺς ἀζύμους. Καὶ ὁ ἄγγελος Κυρίου ἀπῆλθεν ἐξ ὀφθαλμῶν αὐτοῦ.
**22.** Καὶ ἴδε Γεδεών, ὅτι ἄγγελος Κυρίου ἐστί· καὶ εἶπε Γεδεών. ῎Α ἄ, κύριε, κύριε, ὅτι ἴδον τὸν ἄγγελον Κυρίου πρόσωπον πρὸς πρόσωπον.
**23.** Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Κύριος· εἰρήνη σοι, μὴ φοβοῦ, μὴ ἀποθάνῃς.
**24.** Καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν ἐκεῖ Γεδεὼν θυσιαστήριον τῷ Κυρίῳ, καὶ ἐκάλεσεν αὐτό, Εἰρήνη Κυρίου, ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης, ἔτι αὐτοῦ ὄντος ἐν Ἐφρὰ πατρὸς τοῦ Ἰεζρί.
**25.** Καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐν τῇ νυκτὶ ἐκείνῃ, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Κύριος· λάβε τὸν μόσχον τὸν σιτευτὸν τοῦ πατρός σου, μόσχον τὸν δεύτερον τὸν ἑπταετῆ, καὶ καθελεῖς τὸ θυσιαστήριον τοῦ Βάαλ, ὃ ἔστι τοῦ πατρός σου, καὶ τὸ ἄλσος τὸ ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ ἐκκόψατε·
**26.** καὶ οἰκοδομήσεις θυσιαστήριον Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ σου τῷ ὀρθέντι σοι ἐπὶ τῆς κορυφῆς τοῦ ὄρους Μαὼζ τούτου ἐν τῇ πρατάξει· καὶ λήψῃ τὸν μόσχον τὸν δεύτερον, καὶ ἀνοίσεις ὁλοκαύτωμα ἐν τοῖς ξύλοις τοῦ ἄλσους, ὃ ἐκκόψεις.
**27.** Καὶ ἔλαβε Γεδεὼν τρεισκαίδεκα ἄνδρας ἀπὸ τῶν δούλων αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐποίησε καθὰ ἐλάλησε πρὸς αὐτὸν Κύριος· καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἐφοβήθη τὸν οἶκον τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ τοὺς ἄνδρας τῆς πόλεως, μὴ ποιῆσαι ἡμέρας, καὶ ἐποίησε νυκτός.
**28.** Καὶ ὤρθρισαν οἱ ἄνδρες τῆς πόλεως τὸ πρωΐ· καὶ ἰδοὺ κατεσκαμμένον τὸ θυσιαστήριον τοῦ Βάαλ, καὶ τὸ ἄλσος τὸ ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ ἐκκεκομμένον, καὶ ὁ μόσχος ὁ σιτευτὸς ἀνηνεγμένος εἰς ὁλοκαύτωμα ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον τὸ ᾠκοδομημένον.
**29.** Καὶ εἶπεν ἀνὴρ πρὸς τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ· τίς ἐποίησε τὸ πρᾶγμα

**CHAPTER 6.**

**16.** ...the Angel of the Lord [said], "Surely the Lord shall be with thee, and thou shalt smite Midian as one man."
**17.** And Gideon said unto him, "If now I have found grace in thy sight, then show me a sign that it is thou who speakest with me;
**18.** Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring forth my offering, and set it before thee." And he said, "I will tarry until thou return."
**19.** Then Gideon went in, and made ready a young goat and an ephah of unleavened flour; and the meat he put in a basket, and the broth he poured into a pot. And he brought it forth unto him beneath the oak, and prostrated himself.
**20.** And the Angel of the Lord said unto him, "Take the meat and the unleavened bread, and lay them upon that rock, and pour out the broth." And he did so.
**21.** Then the Angel of the Lord stretched forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the meat and the unleavened [bread]; and fire rose up from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened [bread]. And the Angel of the Lord departed from his sight.
**22.** And Gideon saw that it was an Angel of the Lord; and Gideon said, "Alas, O Lord GOD! For I have seen the Angel of the Lord face to face!"
**23.** And the Lord said unto him, "Peace be unto thee; fear not, thou shalt not die."
**24.** And Gideon built there an altar unto the Lord, and he called it, "The Peace of the Lord" [Yahweh Shalom], unto this day, while he was yet in Ephra of the father of Jezri.
**25.** And it came to pass that same night, the Lord said unto him, "Take thy father's fattened bullock, even the second bullock, seven years old, and thou shalt tear down the altar of Baal that is thy father's; and ye shall cut down the Asherah that is by it.
**26.** And thou shalt build an altar unto the Lord thy God, Him who hath made straight [the way] for thee, upon the top of this Mount Maôz, in its proper arrangement; and thou shalt take the second bullock, and offer up a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah which thou shalt cut down."
**27.** And Gideon took thirteen men from among his servants, and did as the Lord had spoken unto him. And it came to pass, because he feared his father's household and the men of the city, that he did it not by day, but did it by night.
**28.** And when the men of the city rose up early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was torn down, and the Asherah that was by it cut down, and the fattened bullock offered up as a burnt offering upon the altar that was built.
**29.** And a man said unto his neighbour, "Who hath done this thing?"
