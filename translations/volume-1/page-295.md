280 ΑΡΙΘΜΟΙ ΚΕΦ. ΚΓʹ. ΚΔʹ.
15 στῆθι ἐπὶ τῆς θυσίας σου, ἐγὼ δὲ πορεύσομαι ἐπερωτῆσαι τὸν Θεόν.
16 Καὶ συνήντησεν ὁ Θεὸς τῷ Βαλαάμ, καὶ ἐνέβαλε ῥῆμα εἰς τὸ
στόμα αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπεν· ἀποστράφητι πρὸς Βαλάκ, καὶ τάδε
17 λαλήσεις. Καὶ ἀπεστράφη πρὸς αὐτόν· καὶ ὁ δὲ ἐφειστήκει ἐπὶ
τῆς ὁλοκαυτώσεως αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντες οἱ ἄρχοντες Μωὰβ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ.
18 Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Βαλάκ· τί ἐλάλησε Κύριος; Καὶ ἀναλαβὼν τὴν
παραβολὴν αὐτοῦ, εἶπεν· ἀνάστηθι Βαλάκ καὶ ἄκουε, ἐνώτισαι
19 μάρτυς υἱὸς Σεπφώρ. Οὐχ ὡς ἄνθρωπος ὁ Θεὸς διαρτηθῆναι, οὐδὲ
ὡς υἱὸς ἀνθρώπου ἀπειληθῆναι· αὐτὸς εἴπας, οὐχὶ ποιήσει; λα-
20 λήσει, καὶ οὐχὶ ἐμμενεῖ; Ἰδοὺ εὐλογεῖν παρείλημμαι· εὐλογήσω,
21 καὶ οὐ μὴ ἀποστρέψω. Οὐκ ἔσται μόχθος ἐν Ἰακώβ, οὐδὲ ὀρ-
θήσεται πόνος ἐν Ἰσραήλ· Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς αὐτοῦ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, τὰ
22 δὲ ἔνδοξα ἀρχόντων ἐν αὐτῷ. Ὁ Θεὸς ὁ ἐξαγαγὼν αὐτὸν ἐξ Αἰ-
γύπτου, ὡς δόξα μονοκέρωτος αὐτῷ· οὐ γὰρ ἔστιν οἰωνισμὸς ἐν
23 Ἰακώβ, οὐδὲ μαντεία ἐν Ἰσραήλ· κατὰ καιρὸν ῥηθήσεται Ἰα-
κὼβ καὶ τῷ Ἰσραήλ, τί ἐπιτελέσει ὁ Θεός. Ἰδοὺ λαὸς ὡς σκύ-
24 μνος ἀναστήσεται, καὶ ὡς λέων γαυριωθήσεται· οὐ κοιμηθήσεται
25 ἕως φάγῃ θήραν, καὶ αἷμα τραυματιῶν πίεται. Καὶ εἶπε Βαλάκ
πρὸς Βαλαάμ· οὔτε κατάραις κατάρασαι μοι αὐτόν, οὔτε εὐλογῶν
26 μὴ εὐλογήσῃς αὐτόν. Ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ Βαλαάμ, εἶπε τῷ Βαλάκ·
οὐκ ἐλάλησά σοι, λέγων· τὸ ῥῆμα ὃ ἐὰν λαλήσῃ ὁ Θεός, τοῦτο
27 ποιήσω; Καὶ εἶπε Βαλάκ πρὸς Βαλαάμ· δεῦρο, παραλάβω σε εἰς
τόπον ἄλλον, εἰ ἀρέσει τῷ Θεῷ, καὶ κατάρασαί μοι αὐτὸν ἐκεῖθεν.
28 Καὶ παρέλαβε Βαλάκ τὸν Βαλαὰμ ἐπὶ τὴν κορυφὴν τοῦ Φογώρ,
29 τὸ παρατεῖνον εἰς τὴν ἔρημον. Καὶ εἶπε Βαλαὰμ πρὸς Βαλάκ·
οἰκοδόμησόν μοι ὧδε ἑπτὰ βωμούς, καὶ ἑτοίμασόν μοι ὧδε ἑπτὰ
30 μόσχους, καὶ ἑπτὰ κριούς. Καὶ ἐποίησε Βαλάκ, καθάπερ εἶπεν
αὐτῷ Βαλαάμ· καὶ ἀνήνεγκε μόσχον καὶ κριὸν ἐπὶ τὸν βωμόν.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΔʹ. XXIV.

1 Καὶ ἰδὼν Βαλαὰμ ὅτι καλὸν ἔστιν ἐναντίον Κυρίου εὐλογεῖν
τὸν Ἰσραήλ, οὐκ ἐπορεύθη κατὰ τὸ εἰωθὸς εἰς συνάντησιν τοῖς οἰω-
2 νοῖς, καὶ ἀπέστρεψε τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ εἰς τὴν ἔρημον. Καὶ ἐξ-
άρας Βαλαὰμ τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ, καθορᾷ τὸν Ἰσραὴλ ἐστρα-
τοπεδευκότα κατὰ φυλάς· καὶ ἐγένετο ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ πνεῦμα Θεοῦ.

**NUMBERS CHAPTER 23**

15 Stand thou by thy sacrifice, and I shall go to enquire of God.

16 And God did meet Balaam, and He did put a word into his mouth, and said: "Turn again unto Balak, and thus shalt thou speak."

17 And he turned again unto him; and lo, he stood by his burnt offering, and all the princes of Moab with him.

18 And Balak said unto him: "What hath the Lord spoken?" Then Balaam took up his parable and said: "Arise, Balak, and hearken! Give ear, O son of Sepphor!

19 God is not as man, to be swayed or held in suspense, nor as the son of man, to be put in dread [or to be threatened]. Hath He spoken, and shall He not perform it? Hath He declared [a thing], and shall He not stand by it?

20 Behold, I have received [a charge] to bless; I shall bless, and I shall not turn back.

21 There shall be no toil in Jacob, neither shall sorrow be raised up in Israel; the Lord his God is with him, and the glorious things of rulers are in him.

22 God, Who brought him forth out of Egypt, is unto him as the glory of a unicorn. For there is no augury in Jacob, neither any divination in Israel. In due time shall it be said to Jacob and to Israel: 'What God hath wrought!'"

23 Behold, a people as a lion's cub shall arise, and as a lion shall it be exalted; it shall not lie down until it hath eaten of the prey, and drunk the blood of the wounded.

24 And Balak said unto Balaam: "Neither curse thou him for me with curses, nor by blessing, do thou bless him."

25 Then Balaam answered and said unto Balak: "Did I not speak unto thee, saying: 'Whatsoever word God shall speak, that shall I do'?"

26 And Balak said unto Balaam: "Come now, I will take thee unto another place, if it please God, and curse thou him for me from thence."

27 And Balak took Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh out over the desert.

28 And Balaam said unto Balak: "Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven calves and seven rams."

29 And Balak did as Balaam had said; and he offered a calf and a ram upon the altar.

**CHAPTER 24**

1 And when Balaam saw that it was good in the sight of the Lord to bless Israel, he went not, as was his wont, to meet with omens, but turned his face toward the wilderness.

2 And Balaam lifted up his eyes and saw Israel encamped according to their tribes; and the Spirit of God came upon him.
