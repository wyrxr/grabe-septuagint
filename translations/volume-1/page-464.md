φθάε ἄνδρες λιτοί, καὶ συνεξεπορεύοντο μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐγένετο 4
μεθ᾿ ἡμέρας, καὶ ἐπολέμησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἀμμὼν μετὰ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ 5
ἐγενήθη, ἡνίκα ἐπολέμησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἀμμὼν μετὰ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐ-
πορεύθησαν οἱ πρεσβύτεροι Γαλαάδ, παραλαβεῖν τὸν Ἰεφθάε ἐν γῇ
Τώβ. Καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς Ἰεφθάε· δεῦρο καὶ ἔσῃ ἡμῖν εἰς ἡγούμε- 6
νον, καὶ πολεμήσομεν ἐν τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἀμμὼν. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰεφθάε 7
τοῖς πρεσβυτέροις Γαλαάδ· οὐχ ὑμεῖς ἐμισήσατέ με, καὶ ἐξεβάλε-
τέ με ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ πατρός μου, καὶ ἐξεπεστείλατέ με ἀφ᾿ ὑ-
μῶν; καὶ τί ὅτι ἤλθατε πρός με, ἡνίκα ἐθλίβητε; Καὶ εἶπαν οἱ 8
πρεσβύτεροι Γαλαάδ πρὸς Ἰεφθάε· οὐχ οὕτως νῦν ἤλθομεν πρός
σε, καὶ συμπορεύσῃ ἡμῖν, καὶ πολεμήσομεν ἐν τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἀμ-
μὼν· καὶ ἔσῃ ἡμῖν εἰς κεφαλὴν πᾶσι τοῖς κατοικοῦσι Γαλαάδ.
Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰεφθάε πρὸς τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους Γαλαάδ· εἰ ἐπιστρέψε- 9
τέ με ὑμεῖς, πολεμῆσαι ἐν τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἀμμὼν, παραδῶ Κύριος αὐ-
τοὺς ἐνώπιον ἐμοῦ, ἐγὼ ὑμῖν ἔσομαι εἰς κεφαλήν; Καὶ εἶπαν οἱ 10
πρεσβύτεροι Γαλαάδ πρὸς Ἰεφθάε· Κύριος ἔσται ὁ ἀκούων ἀναμέσον
ἡμῶν, εἰ μὴ κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμά σου οὕτω ποιήσομεν. Καὶ ἐπο- 11
ρεύθη Ἰεφθάε μετὰ τῶν πρεσβυτέρων Γαλαάδ, καὶ κατέστησαν ὁ
λαὸς αὐτὸν ἐπ᾿ αὐτῶν εἰς κεφαλὴν καὶ εἰς ἡγούμενον· καὶ ἐλάλη-
σεν Ἰεφθάε πάντας τοὺς λόγους αὐτοῦ ἐνώπιον Κυρίου ἐν Μασ-
σηφά. Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ἰεφθάε ἀγγέλους πρὸς βασιλέα υἱῶν Ἀμ- 12
μὼν, λέγων· τί ἐμοὶ καὶ σοί, ὅτι ἥκεις πρός με σὺ, πολεμῆσαί
με ἐν τῇ γῇ μου; Καὶ εἶπε βασιλεὺς υἱῶν Ἀμμὼν πρὸς τοὺς ἀγ- 13
γέλους Ἰεφθάε· διότι ἔλαβεν Ἰσραὴλ τὴν γῆν μου ἐν τῇ ἀναβάσει
αὐτοῦ ἐξ Αἰγύπτου, ἀπὸ Ἀρνῶν καὶ ἕως Ἰαβὸκ καὶ ἕως τοῦ Ἰ-
ορδάνου· καὶ νῦν ἐπίστρεψον αὐτὰς μετ᾿ εἰρήνης. Καὶ ἀπέστρεψαν
οἱ ἄγγελοι πρὸς Ἰεφθάε. Καὶ προσέθετο ἔτι Ἰεφθάε, καὶ ἀπέ- 14
στειλεν (Ἰεφθάε) ἀγγέλους πρὸς τὸν βασιλέα υἱῶν Ἀμμὼν, λέ-
γων· τάδε λέγει Ἰεφθάε· οὐκ ἔλαβεν Ἰσραὴλ τὴν γῆν Μωάβ καὶ 15
τὴν γῆν υἱῶν Ἀμμὼν ἐν τῇ ἀναβάσει αὐτῶν ἐξ Αἰγύπτου, ἀλλ᾿ 16
ἐπορεύθη Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ ἕως θαλάσσης ἐρυθρᾶς, καὶ ἦλθεν
ἕως Κάδης. Καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν Ἰσραὴλ ἀγγέλους πρὸς βασιλέα 17
Ἐδώμ, λέγων· παρελεύσομαι δὴ διὰ τῆς γῆς σου· καὶ οὐκ ἤκου-
σεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Ἐδώμ. Καίγε πρὸς βασιλέα Μωάβ ἀπέστειλε, καὶ
οὐκ ἠθέλησε· καὶ ἐκάθησεν Ἰσραὴλ ἐν Κάδης. Καὶ διῆλθεν ἐν τῇ 18
ἐρήμῳ, καὶ ἐκύκλωσε τὴν γῆν Ἐδώμ καὶ τὴν γῆν Μωάβ· καὶ παρεγένετο
κατ᾿ ἀνατολὰς ἡλίου τῆς γῆς Μωάβ, καὶ παρενέβαλον ἐν τῷ πέραν Ἀρνῶν, καὶ οὐκ εἰσῆλθον εἰς τὸ ὅριον Μωάβ,
19 ὅτι Ἀρνῶν ἦν ὅριον Μωάβ. Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ἰσραὴλ ἀγγέλους πρὸς
    Σηὼν βασιλέα Ἑσεβών, βασιλέα τῶν Ἀμοῤῥαίων, καὶ εἶπεν αὐ-
    τῷ Ἰσραήλ· παρελεύσομαι δὴ διὰ τῆς γῆς σου ἕως τοῦ τόπου
20 μου. Καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησε Σηὼν διελθεῖν τὸν Ἰσραὴλ διὰ τῶν ὁρίων
    αὐτοῦ· καὶ συνήγαγε Σηὼν πάντα τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ παρενέ-
21 βαλεν ἐν Ἰασᾶ, καὶ ἐπολέμησε μετὰ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ παρέδωκε Κύ-
    ριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραὴλ τὸν Σηὼν καὶ πάντα τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ ἐν χει-
    ρὶ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτούς· καὶ ἐκληρονόμησεν Ἰσραὴλ πᾶσαν
22 τὴν γῆν τοῦ Ἀμοῤῥαίου τοῦ κατοικοῦντος ἐν τῇ γῇ ἐκείνῃ· καὶ ἐκλη-
    ρονόμησε πᾶν τὸ ὅριον τοῦ Ἀμοῤῥαίου, ἀπὸ Ἀρνῶν καὶ ἕως τοῦ Ἰαβὸκ
23 καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς ἐρήμου καὶ ἕως τοῦ Ἰορδάνου. Καὶ νῦν Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἐξ-
    εῖλε τὸν Ἀμοῤῥαῖον ἐκ προσώπου τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ σὺ κληρο-
24 νομήσεις αὐτὸν ἐπὶ σοῦ; οὐχὶ ὅσα κατεκληρονόμησέ σοι Χαμὼς ὁ
    Θεός σου, αὐτὰ κληρονομήσεις; καὶ πάντα ὅσα κατεκληρονόμησεν
    ἡμῖν Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν ἀπὸ προσώπου ἡμῶν, αὐτὰ κληρονομή-
25 μεν. Καὶ νῦν μὴ κρείσσων εἶ σὺ τοῦ Βαλὰκ υἱοῦ Σεπφώρ, βασι-
    λέως Μωάβ; μὴ μάχῃ ἐμαχέσατο μετὰ Ἰσραήλ, ἢ πολεμῶν ἐπο-
26 λέμησεν ἐν αὐτοῖς; Ἐν τῷ οἰκῆσαι Ἰσραὴλ ἐν Ἑσεβὼν καὶ ἐν ταῖς
    θυγατράσιν αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐν Ἀροὴρ καὶ ἐν ταῖς θυγατράσιν αὐτῆς, καὶ
    ἐν πάσαις ταῖς πόλεσι ταῖς παρὰ τὸν Ἰορδάνην τριακόσια ἔτη, τί
27 ὅτι οὐκ ἐρύσαντο αὐτοὺς ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ; Καὶ ἐγὼ οὐχ ἥμαρτόν
    σοι, καὶ σὺ ποιεῖς μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ πονηρίαν, τοῦ πολεμῆσαι ἐν ἐμοί·
    κρίναι δ Κύριος ὁ κρίνων σήμερον ἀναμέσον τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ καὶ
28 ἀναμέσον τῶν υἱῶν Ἀμμών. Καὶ οὐκ εἰσήκουσε βασιλεὺς υἱῶν
    Ἀμμὼν (καὶ οὐκ εἰσήκουσε) τῶν λόγων Ἰεφθάε, ὧν ἀπέστειλε πρὸς
29 αὐτόν. Καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐπὶ Ἰεφθάε πνεῦμα Κυρίου, καὶ διέβη τὴν γῆν
    Γαλαάδ, καὶ τὸν Μανασσῆ· καὶ διέβη τὴν σκοπιὰν Γαλαάδ, καὶ
30 ἀπὸ σκοπιᾶς Γαλαὰδ εἰς τὸ πέραν υἱῶν Ἀμμών. Καὶ ηὔξατο Ἰε-
    φθάε εὐχὴν τῷ Κυρίῳ, καὶ εἶπεν· ἐὰν παραδώσει παραδῷς μοι τοὺς
31 υἱοὺς Ἀμμὼν ἐν χειρί μου, καὶ ἔσται ὁ ἐκπορευόμενος ὃς ἂν ἐξέλθῃ
    ἐκ τῶν θυρῶν τοῦ οἴκου μου εἰς ἀπάντησίν μου, ἐν τῷ ἐπιστρέψαι
    με ἐν εἰρήνῃ ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν Ἀμμών, καὶ ἔσται τῷ Κυρίῳ καὶ ἀνοίσω,
32 αὐτὸν ὁλοκαύτωμα. Καὶ διέβη Ἰεφθάε πρὸς τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἀμμών, τοῦ
    πολεμῆσαι πρὸς αὐτούς· καὶ παρέδωκεν αὐτοὺς Κύριος ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ.

### Judges Chapter 11

**3.** —Jephthah idle men, and they went out with him.

**4.** And it came to pass after some days, that the children of Ammon fought against Israel.

**5.** And it came to pass, when the children of Ammon fought against Israel, that the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob.

**6.** And they said unto Jephthah, "Come, and be our leader, that we may fight against the children of Ammon."

**7.** And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, "Did not ye hate me, and cast me out of my father's house, and send me away from you? And why come ye unto me now, when ye are in distress?"

**8.** And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, "Nay, but now we have come again unto thee, that thou mayest go with us, and we may fight against the children of Ammon; and thou shalt be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead."

**9.** And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, "If ye bring me back to fight against the children of Ammon, and the Lord deliver them before me, shall I then be your head?"

**10.** And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, "The Lord be witness between us, if we do not so according to thy word."

**11.** And Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and leader over them: and Jephthah uttered all his words before the Lord in Mizpeh.

**12.** And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon, saying, "What is between me and thee, that thou art come unto me to fight against me in my land?"

**13.** And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah, "Because Israel took my land, when he came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and unto the Jordan: now therefore restore them peacefully." And the messengers returned unto Jephthah.

**14.** And Jephthah added yet again, and sent (Jephthah) messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon, saying,

**15.** "Thus saith Jephthah: Israel took not the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon, when they came up out of Egypt;

**16.** but Israel walked through the wilderness unto the Red Sea, and came unto Kadesh.

**17.** And Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, 'Let me pass, I pray thee, through thy land:' but the king of Edom would not hearken [thereto]. And likewise he sent unto the king of Moab, but he would not [consent]; so Israel abode in Kadesh.

**18.** And he passed through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom and the land of Moab; and he passed along the east side of the land of Moab, and they encamped on the other side of Arnon, and entered not into the border of Moab,

**19.** for Arnon was the border of Moab. And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon, king of Heshbon, king of the Amorites, and Israel said unto him, 'Let me pass, I pray thee, through thy land unto my place.'

**20.** But Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his borders; and Sihon gathered all his people, and encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.

**21.** And the Lord God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and he smote them; and Israel inherited all the land of the Amorite who dwelt in that land;

**22.** and he inherited all the border of the Amorite, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto the Jordan.

**23.** And now the Lord God hath dispossessed the Amorite from before His people Israel, and wilt thou inherit him for thyself?

**24.** Wilt thou not inherit whatsoever Chemosh thy god hath bequeathed unto thee? And whatsoever the Lord our God hath bequeathed unto us from before us, that will we inherit.

**25.** And now, art thou better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever contend in battle with Israel, or fight against them in war?

**26.** While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and its villages, and in Aroer and its villages, and in all the cities along the Jordan for three hundred years, why did ye not rescue them in that time?

**27.** And I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest evil against me, to fight against me; the Lord, the Judge, judge this day between the children of Israel and between the children of Ammon."

**28.** But the king of the children of Ammon did not hearken (and he did not hearken) unto the words of Jephthah which he sent unto him.

**29.** And the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah, and he passed through the land of Gilead and Manasseh; and he passed over the watchtower of Gilead, and from the watchtower of Gilead unto the other side of the children of Ammon.

**30.** And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the Lord, and said, "If Thou wilt surely deliver the children of Ammon into my hand,

**31.** then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, it shall surely be the Lord's, and I will offer him for a burnt offering."

**32.** So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the Lord delivered them into his hand.
