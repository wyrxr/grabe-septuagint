ρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ὑμῶν, ὅσα ἐγὼ ἐντέλλομαι ὑμῖν σήμερον. Οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ ὑμῶν ἑωράκασι πάντα ὅσα ἐποίησε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν
τῷ Βεελφεγώρ, ὅτι πᾶς ἄνθρωπος ὅστις ἐπορεύθη ὀπίσω Βεελφεγώρ, ἐξέτριψεν αὐτὸν Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν ἐξ ὑμῶν· ὑμεῖς δὲ 4
οἱ προσκείμενοι Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ ὑμῶν, ζῆτε πάντες ἐν τῇ σήμερον. Ἴδετε, δέδειχα ὑμῖν δικαιώματα καὶ κρίσεις, καθὰ ἐνετείλατο 5
μοι Κύριος ὁ Θεός μου, ποιῆσαι οὕτως ὑμᾶς ἐν τῇ γῇ, εἰς ἣν
ὑμεῖς εἰσπορεύεσθε ἐκεῖ, κληρονομεῖν αὐτήν. Καὶ φυλάξεσθε, καὶ 6
ποιήσετε· ὅτι αὕτη ἡ σοφία ὑμῶν καὶ ἡ σύνεσις ὑμῶν ἐναντίον
πάντων τῶν ἐθνῶν, ὅσοι ἂν ἀκούσωσι πάντα τὰ δικαιώματα ταῦτα, καὶ ἐροῦσιν· ἰδοὺ λαὸς σοφὸς καὶ ἐπιστήμων τὸ ἔθνος τὸ μέγα τοῦτο. Ὅτι ποῖον ἔθνος μέγα, ᾧ ἐστιν (ἐν) αὐτῷ Θεὸς ἐγγίζων αὐτοῖς, ὡς Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν ἐν πᾶσιν οἷς ἂν αὐτὸν
ἐπικαλεσώμεθα; Καὶ ποῖον ἔθνος μέγα, ᾧ ἐστιν (ἐν) αὐτῷ δικαιώματα καὶ κρίματα δίκαια, κατὰ πάντα τὸν νόμον τοῦτον, ὃν ἐγὼ
δίδωμι ἐνώπιον ὑμῶν σήμερον; Πρόσεχε σεαυτῷ, καὶ φύλαξον τὴν 9
ψυχήν σου σφόδρα, μὴ ἐπιλάθῃ πάντας τοὺς λόγους, οὓς ἑωράκασιν οἱ ὀφθαλμοί σου, καὶ μὴ ἀποστήτωσαν ἀπὸ τῆς καρδίας σου
πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς ζωῆς σου· καὶ συμβιβάσεις τοὺς υἱούς σου
καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς τῶν υἱῶν σου, ἡμέραν ἣν ἔστητε ἐνώπιον Κυρίου 10
τοῦ Θεοῦ ὑμῶν ἐν Χωρὴβ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῆς ἐκκλησίας, ὅτε εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς μέ· ἐκκλησίασον πρὸς μέ τὸν λαόν, καὶ ἀκουσάτωσαν τὰ
ῥήματά μου, ὅπως μάθωσι φοβεῖσθαί με πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας ὅσας
αὐτοὶ ζῶσιν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτῶν διδάξουσι. Καὶ 11
προσήλθετε, καὶ ἔστητε ὑπὸ τὸ ὄρος· καὶ τὸ ὄρος ἐκαίετο πυρὶ
ἕως καρδίας τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, σκότος, γνόφος, θύελλα. Καὶ ἐλάλησε 12
Κύριος πρὸς ὑμᾶς (ἐν τῷ ὄρει) ἐκ μέσου τοῦ πυρός· φωνὴν ῥημάτων ὑμεῖς ἠκούσατε, καὶ ὁμοίωμα οὐκ εἴδετε, ἀλλ᾽ ἢ φωνὴν.
καὶ ἀνήγγειλεν ὑμῖν τὴν διαθήκην αὐτοῦ, ἣν ἐνετείλατο ὑμῖν ποιεῖν, τὰ δέκα ῥήματα, καὶ ἔγραψεν αὐτὰ ἐπὶ δύο πλάκας λιθίνας.
Καὶ ἐμοὶ ἐνετείλατο Κύριος ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ, διδάξαι ὑμᾶς 14
δικαιώματα καὶ κρίσεις, ποιεῖν ὑμᾶς αὐτὰ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, εἰς ἣν
ὑμεῖς εἰσπορεύεσθε ἐκεῖ, κληρονομῆσαι αὐτήν. Καὶ φυλάξεσθε σφόδρα 15 τὰς ψυχὰς ὑμῶν, (ὅτι οὐκ εἴδετε πᾶν ὁμοίωμα ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ᾗ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς ὑμᾶς ἐν Χωρὴβ ἐν τῷ ὄρει ἐκ μέσου
τοῦ πυρός)· μή ποτε ἀνομήσητε καὶ ποιήσητε ὑμῖν αὐτοῖς γλυπτὸν 16

**CHAPTER IV.**

3 of the Lord your God, whatsoever I command you this day. Your eyes have seen all that the Lord your God did unto Baal-peor; for every man that went after Baal-peor, the Lord your God hath utterly destroyed him from among you.
4 But ye that cleave unto the Lord your God, ye are alive every one of you this day.
5 Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the Lord my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it.
6 Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of all the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and they shall say, 'Surely this great nation is a wise and discerning people.'
7 For what great nation is there, that hath a God (in its midst) drawing near unto them, as the Lord our God [doth] in all things for which we call upon Him?
8 And what great nation is there, that hath (in its midst) statutes and righteous judgments, according to all this Law which I set before you this day?
9 Take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget all the words which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life; and thou shalt instruct thy sons and thy sons’ sons,
10 on the day that ye stood before the Lord your God in Horeb, in the day of the assembly, when the Lord said unto me, 'Assemble the people unto Me, and let them hear My words, that they may learn to fear Me all the days that they live upon the earth, and that they may teach their sons.'
11 And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain did burn with fire unto the heart of heaven, with darkness, thick darkness, and a tempest.
12 And the Lord spake unto you (upon the mount) out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of words, but saw no likeness, save a voice.
13 And He declared unto you His covenant, which He commanded you to perform, even the ten words; and He wrote them upon two tables of stone.
14 And the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that ye might perform them in the land whither ye go over to possess it.
15 Take ye therefore good heed unto your souls (for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the Lord spake unto you in Horeb upon the mount out of the midst of the fire);
16 lest ye transgress and make for yourselves a graven [image],
