**35** χων οἴκου πατριῶν τοῦ δήμου τοῦ Μεραρί. Σουριὴλ υἱὸς Ἀβιχαιὶ
**36** ἐκ πλαγίων τῆς σκηνῆς παρεμβαλοῦσι πρὸς βορρᾶν. Ἡ ἐπίσκεψις τῆς φυλακῆς υἱῶν Μεραρί, τὰς κεφαλίδας τῆς σκηνῆς, καὶ τοὺς μοχλοὺς αὐτῆς, καὶ τοὺς στύλους αὐτῆς, καὶ τὰς βάσεις αὐτῆς, καὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη αὐτῶν, καὶ πάντα τὰ ἔργα αὐ-
**37** τών, καὶ τοὺς στύλους τῆς αὐλῆς κύκλῳ, καὶ τὰς βάσεις αὐτῶν,
**38** καὶ τοὺς πασσάλους αὐτῶν, καὶ τοὺς κάλους αὐτῶν. Καὶ οἱ παρεμβάλλοντες κατὰ πρόσωπον τῆς σκηνῆς ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν κατέναντι τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν, Μωυσῆς καὶ Ἀαρὼν καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ, φυλάσσοντες τὰς φυλακὰς τοῦ ἁγίου εἰς τὰς φυλακὰς τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ· καὶ ὁ ἀλλογενὴς ὁ προσπορευόμενος ἀποθανεῖται.
**39** Πᾶσα ἡ ἐπίσκεψις τῶν Λευιτῶν, οὓς ἐπεσκέψατο Μωυσῆς καὶ Ἀαρὼν διὰ φωνῆς Κυρίου κατὰ δήμους αὐτῶν, πᾶν ἀρσενικὸν ἀπὸ μηνιαίου καὶ ἐπάνω, δύο καὶ εἴκοσι χιλιάδες.
**40** Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, λέγων· ἐπίσκεψαι πᾶν πρωτότοκων ἄρσεν τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ ἀπὸ μηνιαίου καὶ ἐπάνω, καὶ λάβε τὸν ἀριθμὸν αὐτῶν ἐξ ὀνόματος·
**41** καὶ λήψῃ τοὺς Λευίτας ἐμοὶ (ἐγὼ Κύριος) ἀντὶ πάντων τῶν πρωτοτόκων τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ τὰ κτήνη τῶν Λευιτῶν ἀντὶ πάντων τῶν πρωτοτόκων ἐν τοῖς κτήνεσι τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ.
**42** Καὶ ἐπεσκέψατο Μωυσῆς ὃν τρόπον ἐνετείλατο Κύριος αὐτῷ, πᾶν πρωτότοκον ἐν τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ·
**43** καὶ ἐγένοντο πάντα τὰ πρωτότοκα ἀρσενικὰ κατὰ ἀριθμὸν ἐξ ὀνόματος ἀπὸ μηνιαίου καὶ ἐπάνω ἐκ τῆς ἐπισκέψεως αὐτῶν, δύο καὶ εἴκοσι χιλιάδες, τρεῖς καὶ ἑβδομήκοντα καὶ διακόσιοι.
**44** Καὶ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, λέγων·
**45** λάβε τοὺς Λευίτας ἀντὶ πάντων τῶν πρωτοτόκων τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ τὰ κτήνη τῶν Λευιτῶν ἀντὶ τῶν κτηνῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔσονται ἐμοὶ οἱ Λευῖται ἐγὼ Κύριος.
**46** Καὶ τὰ λύτρα τριῶν καὶ ἑβδομήκοντα καὶ διακοσίων οἱ πλεονάζοντες παρὰ τοὺς Λευίτας ἀπὸ τῶν πρωτοτόκων τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ,
**47** καὶ λήψῃ πέντε πέντε σίκλους κατὰ κεφαλήν, κατὰ τὸ δίδραχμον τὸ ἅγιον λήψῃ· (εἴκοσι ὀβολοὶ ὁ σίκλος)
**48** καὶ δώσεις τὸ ἀργύριον Ἀαρὼν καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ, λύτρα τῶν πλεοναζόντων ἐν αὐτοῖς.
**49** Καὶ ἔλαβε Μωυσῆς τὸ ἀργύριον, λύτρα παρὰ τῶν πλεοναζόντων ἐν αὐτοῖς, εἰς τὴν ἐκλύτρωσιν τῶν Λευιτῶν·
**50** παρὰ τῶν πρωτοτόκων τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ ἔλαβε τὸ ἀργύριον, πέντε καὶ ἑξκοντα καὶ τριακοσίους καὶ χιλίους σίκλους, κατὰ τὸν σίκλον τὸν [ἅγιον].

### NUMBERS CHAPTER 3

**35** ...[belonging to] the house of the families of the clan of Merari. And Suriel, the son of Abichail, [shall be] the chief of the house of the families of Merari.
**36** And they shall encamp upon the northern side of the Tabernacle. The charge and oversight of the sons of Merari shall comprehend the capitals of the Tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and the sockets thereof, and all the vessels of the Tabernacle, and all their appurtenances pertaining to the service thereof;
**37** and the pillars of the court round about, and the sockets thereof,
**38** and their pegs, and their ropes. And those that encamp before the Tabernacle from the east, over against the Tabernacle of Testimony from the east, shall be Moses, and Aaron, and his sons, keeping the charge of the sanctuary for the charge of the sons of Israel; and the stranger who approacheth [unto it] shall surely die.
**39** All the registered number of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron did count by the voice of the Lord according to their clans, every male from a month old and upward, were twenty-two thousand.

**40** And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying: "Number every firstborn male of the sons of Israel, from a month old and upward, and take the sum of them by name.
**41** And thou shalt take the Levites for Me (I am the Lord) instead of all the firstborn among the sons of Israel; and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the cattle of the sons of Israel."
**42** And Moses numbered all the firstborn among the sons of Israel, in the manner which the Lord had commanded him.
**43** And all the firstborn males, by the number of their names, from a month old and upward, from their census, were twenty-two thousand, three hundred and seventy-three.

**44** And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying:
**45** "Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn of the sons of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the Levites shall be Mine; I am the Lord."
**46** And for the ransom of the two hundred and seventy-three, who exceed the number of the Levites among the firstborn of the sons of Israel,
**47** thou shalt take five shekels for each head, according to the holy didrachm standard shalt thou take [them]; (a shekel is twenty obols).
**48** And thou shalt give the money unto Aaron and to his sons, for the ransom of those who are in excess among them.
**49** So Moses took the redemption money from those who were in excess among them, for the redemption of the Levites.
**50** From the firstborn of the sons of Israel, he took the money: one thousand three hundred and sixty-five shekels, according to the holy shekel.
