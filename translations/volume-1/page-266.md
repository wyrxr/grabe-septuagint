ΚΕΦ. Θʹ. Ιʹ. · ΑΡΙΘΜΟΙ 251
λείψουσιν ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸ πρωΐ, καὶ ὀστοῦν οὐ συντριβήσεται ἀπ᾿
αὐτοῦ, κατὰ πάντα τὸν νόμον τοῦ πάσχα ποιήσουσιν αὐτό. Καὶ 13
ἄνθρωπος ὃς ἂν καθαρός ἦ, καὶ ἐν ὁδῷ μακρὰν οὐκ ἔστι,
καὶ ὑστερήσῃ τοῦ ποιῆσαι τὸ πάσχα, ἐξολοθρευθήσεται ἡ ψυχὴ
ἐκείνη ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτῆς, ὅτι τὸ δῶρον Κυρίου οὐ προσήνεγκε
κατὰ τὸν καιρὸν αὐτοῦ, ἁμαρτίαν αὐτοῦ λήψεται ὁ ἄνθρωπος ἐκεῖ-
νος. Ἐὰν δὲ προσέλθῃ πρὸς ὑμᾶς προσήλυτος ἐν τῇ γῇ ὑμῶν, 14
καὶ ποιήσῃ τὸ πάσχα Κυρίῳ, κατὰ τὸν νόμον τοῦ πάσχα, καὶ
κατὰ τὴν σύνταξιν αὐτοῦ οὕτω ποιήσει αὐτό· νόμος εἷς ἔσται
ὑμῖν, καὶ τῷ προσηλύτῳ, καὶ τῷ αὐτόχθονι τῆς γῆς. Καὶ τῇ 15
ἡμέρᾳ ᾗ ἐστάθη ἡ σκηνή, ἐκάλυψεν ἡ νεφέλη τὴν σκηνήν, τὸν οἶ-
κον τοῦ μαρτυρίου· καὶ τὸ ἑσπέρας ἦν ἐπὶ τῆς σκηνῆς ὡς εἶδος
πυρὸς ἕως πρωΐ. Οὕτως ἐγένετο διαπαντός· ἡ νεφέλη ἐκάλυπτεν 16
αὐτὴν ἡμέρας, καὶ εἶδος πυρὸς τὴν νύκτα. Καὶ ἡνίκα ἀνέβη ἡ νε- 17
φέλη ἀπὸ τῆς σκηνῆς, καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα ἀπῆρον οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ·
καὶ ἐν τῷ τόπῳ οὗ ἂν ἔστη ἡ νεφέλη, ἐκεῖ παρενέβαλλον οἱ υἱοὶ
Ἰσραήλ. Διὰ προστάγματος Κυρίου παρεμβαλοῦσιν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ, 18
καὶ διὰ προστάγματος Κυρίου ἀπαροῦσι· πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας ἐν
αἷς σκιάζει ἡ νεφέλη ἐπὶ τῆς σκηνῆς, παρεμβαλοῦσιν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσ-
ραήλ. Καὶ ὅταν ἐφέλκηται ἡ νεφέλη ἐπὶ τῆς σκηνῆς ἡμέρας 19
πλείους, καὶ φυλάξονται οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ τὴν φυλακὴν τοῦ Θεοῦ,
καὶ οὐ μὴ ἐξάρσι· καὶ ἔσται ὅταν σκεπάσῃ ἡ νεφέλη ἡμέρας 20
ἀριθμῷ ἐπὶ τῆς σκηνῆς, διὰ φωνῆς Κυρίου παρεμβαλοῦσι, καὶ
διὰ προστάγματος Κυρίου ἐξαροῦσι. Καὶ ἔσται ὅταν γένηται ἡ 21
νεφέλη ἀφ᾿ ἑσπέρας ἕως πρωΐ, καὶ ἀναβῇ ἡ νεφέλη τὸ πρωΐ,
καὶ ἀπαροῦσιν· ἡμέρας ἢ νυκτός, καὶ ἀναβῇ ἡ νεφέλη, ἀπαροῦσιν.
Ἡμέρας, ἢ μηνὸς ἡμέρας, πλεοναζούσης τῆς νεφέλης ἐπὶ τῆς 22
σκηνῆς, σκιαζούσης ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς, παρεμβαλοῦσιν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ,
καὶ οὐ μὴ ἀπάρωσι· καὶ ἐν τῷ ἀναχθῆναι αὐτήν, ἀπῆραν. Ὅτι 23
διὰ προστάγματος Κυρίου παρεμβαλοῦσι, καὶ διὰ προστάγματος
Κυρίου ἀπαροῦσι· τὴν φυλακὴν Κυρίου ἐφύλαξαν διὰ προστάγματος
Κυρίου ἐν χειρὶ Μωυσῆ.

**NUMBERS CHAPTER 9**

They shall leave none thereof until the morning, nor shall a bone thereof be broken; according to all the statutes of the Passover shall they keep it.

13 And if there be a man who is clean, and is not upon a far journey, and yet faileth to keep the Passover, that soul shall be cut off from among his people; because he brought not the offering of the Lord in its appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.

14 And if a sojourner sojourn among you in your land, and will keep the Passover unto the Lord, according to the statute of the Passover and according to its ordinance, so shall he keep it. One law shall there be for you, and for the sojourner, and for the native of the land.

15 And on the day that the Tabernacle was set up, the cloud covered the Tabernacle, the Tent of Witness; and in the evening, there was upon the Tabernacle as the appearance of fire, even until the morning.

16 Thus it was continually: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night.

17 And when the cloud went up from the Tabernacle, then after these things the sons of Israel journeyed; and in the place where the cloud abode, there the sons of Israel encamped.

18 By the commandment of the Lord shall the sons of Israel encamp, and by the commandment of the Lord shall they journey. All the days in which the cloud overshadoweth the Tabernacle, the sons of Israel shall encamp.

19 And when the cloud tarried upon the Tabernacle for many days, then the sons of Israel kept the charge of God, and they would not journey forth.

20 And it came to pass, when the cloud covered the Tabernacle for a [few] number of days, by the voice of the Lord would they encamp, and by the commandment of the Lord would they journey forth.

21 And it came to pass, when the cloud was [there] from evening until morning, and the cloud went up in the morning, then they would journey forth. Whether by day or by night, if the cloud went up, they would journey forth.

22 For days, or for a full month of days, when the cloud abode upon the Tabernacle, overshadowing it, the sons of Israel would encamp and would not journey forth. But when it was taken up, they journeyed forth.

23 For by the commandment of the Lord they would encamp, and by the commandment of the Lord would they journey forth. The charge of the Lord did they keep by the commandment of the Lord, by the hand of Moses.

**NUMBERS CHAPTER 10**

1 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying:

2 "Make for thyself two trumpets of silver; of beaten work shalt thou make them, and they shall be [unto thee]
