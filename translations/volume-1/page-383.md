ΔΕΥΤΕΡΟΝΟΜΙΟΝ ΚΕΦ. ΛΑʹ.
σῆς καὶ Ἰησοῦς εἰς τὴν σκηνὴν τοῦ μαρτυρίου, καὶ ἔστησαν παρὰ
15 τὰς θύρας τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου. Καὶ κατέβη Κύριος ἐν σκη-
νῇ ἐν στύλῳ νεφέλης, καὶ ἔστη ἐπὶ τὰς θύρας τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ
μαρτυρίου· καὶ ἔστη ὁ στύλος τῆς νεφέλης ἐπὶ τὰς θύρας τῆς σκη-
16 νῆς (τοῦ μαρτυρίου). Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν· Ἰδοὺ σὺ
κοιμᾶσαι μετὰ τῶν πατέρων σου, καὶ ἀναστὰς ὁ λαὸς οὗτος ἐκ-
πορνεύσει ὀπίσω θεῶν ἀλλοτρίων τῆς γῆς, εἰς ἣν οὗτος εἰσπορεύε-
ται ἐκεῖ εἰς αὐτήν, καὶ ἐγκαταλείψουσί με, καὶ διασκεδάδουσι τὴν
17 διαθήκην μου, ἣν διεθέμην αὐτοῖς. Καὶ ὀργισθήσομαι θυμῷ αὐτοῖς
ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, καὶ καταλείψω αὐτούς, καὶ ἀποστρέψω τὸ πρό-
σωπόν μου ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔσται κατάβρωμα· καὶ εὑρήσουσιν αὐ-
τὸν κακὰ πολλὰ καὶ θλίψεις, καὶ ἐρεῖ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ· διότι
οὐκ ἔστι Κύριος ὁ Θεός μου ἐν ἡμῖν, εὑρόσαν με τὰ κακὰ ταῦ-
18 τα. Ἐγὼ δὲ ἀποστροφῇ ἀποστρέψω τὸ πρόσωπόν μου ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν
ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ διὰ πάσας τὰς κακίας ἃς ἐποίησαν, ὅτι ἐπέ-
19 στρεψαν ἐπὶ θεοὺς ἀλλοτρίους. Καὶ νῦν γράψατε τὰ ῥήματα τῆς
ᾠδῆς ταύτης, καὶ διδάξατε αὐτὴν τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐμβά-
λετε αὐτὴν εἰς τὸ στόμα αὐτῶν, ἵνα γένηταί μοι ἡ ᾠδὴ αὕτη εἰς
20 μαρτύριον ἐν υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ. Εἰσάξω γὰρ αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν γῆν τὴν
ἀγαθὴν ἣν ὤμοσα τοῖς πατράσιν αὐτῶν, γῆν ῥέουσαν γάλα καὶ
μέλι· καὶ φάγονται, καὶ ἐμπλησθέντες χορτήσουσιν, καὶ ἐπιστρα-
φήσονται ἐπὶ θεοὺς ἀλλοτρίους, καὶ λατρεύσουσιν αὐτοῖς, καὶ πα-
ροξυνοῦσί με, καὶ διασκεδάοουσί τὴν διαθήκην μου (ἣν διεθέμην
21 αὐτοῖς). Καὶ ἔσται ὅταν εὕρωσιν αὐτὸν κακὰ πολλὰ καὶ θλίψεις,
καὶ ἀντικαταστήσεται ἡ ᾠδὴ αὕτη κατὰ πρόσωπον αὐτῶν μαρτυροῦσα·
οὐ γὰρ μὴ ἐπιλησθῇ ἀπὸ στόματος αὐτῶν, καὶ ἀπὸ στόματος τοῦ σπέρ-
ματος αὐτῶν· ἐγὼ γὰρ οἶδα τὴν πονηρίαν αὐτῶν, ὅσα ποιοῦσί (μοι)
ὧδε σήμερον, πρὸ τοῦ εἰσαγαγεῖν με αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν γῆν τὴν ἀγαθήν,
22 ἣν ὤμοσα τοῖς πατράσιν αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἔγραψε Μωυσῆς τὴν ᾠδὴν
ταύτην ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ, καὶ ἐδίδαξεν αὐτὴν τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσ-
23 ραήλ· καὶ ἐνετείλατο Μωυσῆς Ἰησοῦ υἱῷ Ναυῆ, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ·
ἀνδρίζου καὶ ἴσχυε· σὺ γὰρ εἰσάξεις τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ εἰς τὴν
24 γῆν, ἣν ὤμοσε Κύριος αὐτοῖς, καὶ αὐτὸς ἔσται μετὰ σοῦ. Ἡνίκα
δὲ συνετέλεσε Μωυσῆς γράφων πάντας τοὺς λόγους τοῦ νόμου
25 τούτου εἰς βιβλίον ἕως εἰς τέλος, καὶ ἐνετείλατο Μωυσῆς τοῖς
Λευίταις τοῖς αἴρουσι τὴν κιβωτὸν τῆς διαθήκης Κυρίου, λέγων·

**Deuteronomy 31**

14 ...ses and Joshua went into the tabernacle of testimony, and they stood
15 by the doors of the tabernacle of testimony. And the Lord descended in a tabernacle in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the doors of the tabernacle of testimony; yea, the pillar of cloud stood at the doors of the tabernacle (of testimony).

16 And the Lord said unto Moses, "Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers; and this people shall rise up, and shall go a-whoring after the strange gods of the land, into which they go thither unto it, and they shall forsake Me, and shall break My covenant which I have made with them.

17 And My wrath shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will turn away My face from them, and it shall be for a prey. And they shall find him amidst many evils and tribulations; and he shall say in that day, 'Because the Lord my God is not among us, these evils did find me.'

18 And I, by turning away, shall surely turn My face from them in that day, because of all the wicked deeds which they have done, even because they have turned unto strange gods.

19 Now therefore, write ye the words of this song, and teach it to the sons of Israel, and put it in their mouth, that this song may be for Me a witness among the sons of Israel.

20 For I will bring them into the good land which I sware unto their fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey; and they shall eat, and being filled, they shall grow fat; and they shall turn unto strange gods, and serve them, and provoke Me to anger, and shall break My covenant (which I made with them).

21 And it shall come to pass, when they shall find him amidst many evils and tribulations, that this song shall rise up against them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of their mouth, nor out of the mouth of their seed. For I know their wickedness, whatsoever they do (unto Me) here this day, before I bring them into the good land which I sware unto their fathers."

22 So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it to the sons of Israel.
23 And Moses gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said unto him, "Be strong and courageous; for thou shalt bring the sons of Israel into the land which the Lord sware unto them, and He Himself shall be with thee."

24 And it came to pass, when Moses had finished writing all the words of this law in a book, even unto the end,
25 that Moses commanded the Levites who bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord, saying,
