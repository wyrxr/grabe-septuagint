2 μοι λατρεύσωσιν. Εἰ δὲ μὴ βούλει σὺ ἐξαποστεῖλαι, ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ τύπτω πάντα τὰ ὅριά σου βατράχους·
3 καὶ ἐξερεύξεται ὁ ποταμὸς βατράχους, καὶ ἀναβάντες εἰσελεύσονται εἰς τοὺς οἴκους σου, καὶ εἰς τὰ ταμιεῖα τῶν κοιτώνων σου, καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν κλινῶν σου, καὶ εἰς τοὺς οἴκους τῶν θεραπόντων σου καὶ τοῦ λαοῦ σου, καὶ ἐν τοῖς φυράμασί σου, καὶ ἐν τοῖς φρέασί σου, καὶ ἐν τοῖς κλιβάνοις σου·
4 καὶ ἐπὶ σέ, καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς θεράποντάς σου, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν λαόν σου ἀναβήσονται οἱ βάτραχοι.
5 Εἶπε δὲ Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν· εἶπον Ἀαρὼν τῷ ἀδελφῷ σου· ἔκτεινον τῇ χειρί σου τὴν ῥάβδον σου ἐπὶ τοὺς ποταμούς, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς διώρυγας καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ ἕλη, καὶ ἀνάγαγε τοὺς βατράχους ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν Αἰγύπτου.
6 Καὶ ἐξέτεινεν Ἀαρὼν τὴν χεῖρα ἐπὶ τὰ ὕδατα Αἰγύπτου, καὶ ἀνήγαγε τοὺς βατράχους· καὶ ἀνεβιβάσθη ὁ βάτραχος, καὶ ἐκάλυψε τὴν γῆν Αἰγύπτου.
7 Ἐποίησαν δὲ ὡσαύτως καὶ οἱ ἐπαοιδοὶ τῶν Αἰγυπτίων ἐν ταῖς ἐπαοιδαῖς αὐτῶν, καὶ ἀνήγαγον τοὺς βατράχους ἐπὶ πᾶσαν γῆν Αἰγύπτου.
8 Καὶ ἐκάλεσε Φαραὼ Μωυσῆν καὶ Ἀαρών, καὶ εἶπεν· εὔξασθε περὶ ἐμοῦ πρὸς Κύριον, καὶ περιελέτω τοὺς βατράχους ἀπ᾽ ἐμοῦ, καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἐμοῦ λαοῦ, καὶ ἐξαποστελῶ τὸν λαόν, καὶ θύσωσι τῷ Κυρίῳ.
9 Εἶπε δὲ Μωυσῆς πρὸς Φαραώ· τάξαι πρός με πότε εὔξομαι περὶ σοῦ, καὶ περὶ τῶν θεραπόντων σου, καὶ τοῦ λαοῦ σου, ἀφανίσαι τοὺς βατράχους ἀπὸ σοῦ, καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ λαοῦ σου, καὶ ἐκ τῶν οἰκιῶν ὑμῶν· πλὴν ἐν τῷ ποταμῷ ὑπολειφθήσονται.
10 Ὁ δὲ εἶπεν· εἰς αὔριον. Εἶπεν οὖν· ὡς εἴρηκας· ἵνα εἰδῇς, ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν ἄλλος πλὴν Κύριος.
11 Καὶ περιαιρεθήσονται οἱ βάτραχοι ἀπὸ σοῦ, καὶ ἐκ τῶν οἰκιῶν ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐκ τῶν ἐπαύλεων, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν θεραπόντων σου, καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ λαοῦ σου· πλὴν ἐν τῷ ποταμῷ ὑπολειφθήσονται.
12 Ἐξῆλθε δὲ Μωυσῆς καὶ Ἀαρὼν ἀπὸ Φαραώ· καὶ ἐβόησε Μωυσῆς πρὸς Κύριον περὶ τοῦ ὁρισμοῦ τῶν βατράχων, ὡς ἐτάξατο Φαραώ.
13 Ἐποίησε δὲ Κύριος καθάπερ εἶπε Μωυσῆς· καὶ ἐτελεύτησαν οἱ βάτραχοι ἐκ τῶν οἰκιῶν, καὶ ἐκ τῶν ἐπαύλεων, καὶ ἐκ τῶν ἀγρῶν·
14 καὶ συνήγαγον αὐτοὺς θημωνίας θημωνίας, καὶ ὤζεσεν ἡ γῆ.
15 Ἰδὼν δὲ Φαραὼ ὅτι γέγονεν ἀνάψυξις, ἐβαρύνθη ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐκ εἰσήκουσεν αὐτῶν, καθάπερ ἐλάλησε Κύριος.
16 Εἶπε δὲ Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν· εἶπον Ἀαρὼν· ἔκτεινον τῇ χειρὶ τὴν ῥάβδον σου, καὶ πάταξον τὸ χῶμα τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἔσονται σκνῖπες ἔν τε τοῖς ἀνθρώποις, καὶ ἐν τοῖς τε-

**EXODUS. CHAPTER 8.**

***

2 that they may worship Me. But if thou refusest to send them forth, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs;
3 and the river shall bring forth frogs in abundance, and they shall come up and enter into thy houses, and into the storerooms of thy bedchambers, and upon thy beds, and into the houses of thy servants and of thy people, and into thy kneading-troughs, and into thy wells, and into thy ovens;
4 and upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people shall the frogs come up.
5 And the Lord said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron thy brother, Stretch forth thy hand with thy rod upon the rivers, and upon the canals and upon the marshes, and bring up the frogs upon the land of Egypt.
6 And Aaron stretched forth his hand upon the waters of Egypt; and he brought up the frogs; and the frog came up, and covered the land of Egypt.
7 And the enchanters of the Egyptians did likewise with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon all the land of Egypt.
8 Then Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron, and said, Pray ye for me unto the Lord, that He may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will send forth the people, and they shall sacrifice unto the Lord.
9 And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Appoint unto me when I shall pray for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, that the frogs may be destroyed from thee, and from thy people, and from your houses; save only in the river shall they be left.
10 And he said, Tomorrow. And Moses said, As thou hast spoken; that thou mayest know that there is none other save the Lord.
11 And the frogs shall be taken away from thee, and from your houses, and from the courts, and from thy servants, and from thy people; save only in the river shall they be left.
12 And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh; and Moses cried unto the Lord concerning the appointed time of the frogs, as Pharaoh had appointed.
13 And the Lord did according as Moses had spoken; and the frogs died out of the houses, and out of the courts, and out of the fields;
14 and they gathered them together in heaps, [even] heaps, and the land stank.
15 But when Pharaoh saw that there was a respite, his heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them, according as the Lord had spoken.
16 And the Lord said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thy hand with thy rod, and smite the dust of the earth, and there shall be gnats both upon men, and upon the four-footed [beasts, and upon all the land of Egypt.]
