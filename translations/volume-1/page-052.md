ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ 37
θεν· Εἶπε δὲ πρὸς αὐτὸν ᾿Αβραάμ· πρόσεχε σεαυτῷ μὴ ἀποστρέ- 6
ψῃς τὸν υἱόν μου ἐκεῖ. Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ ὁ Θεὸς 7
τῆς γῆς, ὃς ἔλαβέ με ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ πατρός μου, καὶ ἐκ τῆς
γῆς ἧς ἐγεννήθην, ὃς ἐλάλησέ μοι, καὶ ὃς ὤμοσέ μοι, λέγων·
σοὶ δώσω τὴν γῆν ταύτην καὶ τῷ σπέρματί σου, αὐτὸς ἀποστε-
λεῖ τὸν ἄγγελόν αὐτοῦ ἔμπροσθέν σου, καὶ λήψῃ γυναῖκα τῷ υἱῷ
μου Ἰσαὰκ ἐκεῖθεν. Ἐὰν δὲ μὴ θέλῃ ἡ γυνὴ πορευθῆναι μετά σοῦ 8
εἰς τὴν γῆν ταύτην, καθαρὸς ἔσῃ ἀπὸ τοῦ ὅρκου μου τούτου· μό-
νον τὸν υἱόν μου μὴ ἀποστρέψῃς ἐκεῖ. Καὶ ἔθηκεν ὁ παῖς τὴν 9
χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ὑπὸ τὸν μηρὸν ᾿Αβραὰμ τοῦ κυρίου αὐτοῦ, καὶ ὤ-
μοσεν αὐτῷ περὶ τοῦ ῥήματος τούτου. Καὶ ἔλαβεν ὁ παῖς δέκα 10
καμήλους ἀπὸ τῶν καμήλων τοῦ κυρίου αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀπὸ πάντων
τῶν ἀγαθῶν τοῦ κυρίου αὐτοῦ μεθ᾿ ἑαυτοῦ· καὶ ἀναστὰς ἐπορεύ-
θη εἰς τὴν Μεσοποταμίαν, εἰς τὴν πόλιν Ναχώρ. Καὶ ἐκοίμισε 11
τὰς καμήλους ἔξω τῆς πόλεως παρὰ τὸ φρέαρ τοῦ ὕδατος τὸ
πρὸς ὄψι, ἡνίκα ἐπορεύοντο αἱ ὑδρευόμεναι. Καὶ εἶπε· Κύριε 12
ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ κυρίου μου ᾿Αβραάμ, εὐόδωσον ἐναντίον ἐμοῦ σήμε-
ρον, καὶ ποίησον ἔλεος μετὰ τοῦ κυρίου μου ᾿Αβραάμ. Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ 13
ἔστηκα ἐπὶ τῆς πηγῆς τοῦ ὕδατος· αἱ δὲ θυγατέρες τῶν οἰκούν-
των τὴν πόλιν, ἐκπορεύονται ἀντλῆσαι ὕδωρ. Καὶ ἔσται ἡ παρ- 14
θένος ᾗ ἂν ἐγὼ εἴπω· ἐπίκλινον τὴν ὑδρίαν σου, ἵνα πίω, καὶ
εἴπῃ μοι· πίε σύ, καὶ τὰς καμήλους σου ποτιῶ, ἕως ἂν παύ-
σονται πίνουσι, ταύτην ἡτοίμασας τῷ παιδί σου Ἰσαάκ· καὶ ἐν
τούτῳ γνώσομαι ὅτι ἐποίησας ἔλεος τῷ κυρίῳ μου ᾿Αβραάμ. Καὶ 15
ἐγένετο πρὸ τοῦ συντελέσαι αὐτὸν λαλοῦντα ἐν τῇ διανοίᾳ, καὶ ἰ-
δοὺ ῾Ρεβέκκα ἐξεπορεύετο, ἡ τεχθεῖσα Βαθουήλ, υἱῷ Μελχάς, τῆς
γυναικός Ναχώρ, ἀδελφοῦ δὲ ᾿Αβραάμ, ἔχουσα τὴν ὑδρίαν ἐπὶ
τῶν ὤμων αὐτῆς. Ἡ δὲ παρθένος ἦν καλὴ τῇ ὄψει σφόδρα· παρ- 16
θένος ἦν, ἀνὴρ οὐκ ἔγνω αὐτήν. Καταβᾶσα δὲ ἐπὶ τὴν πηγήν, ἔ-
πλησε τὴν ὑδρίαν αὐτῆς, καὶ ἀνέβη. Ἐπέδραμε δὲ ὁ παῖς εἰς 17
συνάντησιν αὐτῆς, καὶ εἶπε· πότισόν με μικρὸν ὕδωρ ἐκ τῆς ὑ-
δρίας σου. Ἡ δὲ εἶπε· πίε κύριε. Καὶ ἔσπευσε, καὶ καθεῖλε τὴν 18
ὑδρίαν ἐπὶ τὸν βραχίονα αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐπότισεν αὐτόν, ἕως ἐπαύ-
σατο πίνων. Καὶ εἶπε· καὶ ταῖς καμήλοις σου ὑδρεύσομαι, ἕως ἂν 19
πᾶσαι πίωσι. Καὶ ἔσπευσε καὶ ἐξεκένωσε τὴν ὑδρίαν ἐπὶ τὸ ποτιστή- 20
ριον· καὶ ἔδραμεν ἔτι ἐπὶ τὸ φρέαρ ἀντλῆσαι (ὕδωρ), καὶ ὑδρεύ-

**Chapter 24**

6 And Abraham said unto him, "Take heed to thyself that thou lead not my son back thither.
7 The Lord, the God of Heaven, and the God of the earth, who took me from the house of my father, and from the land where I was born, and who spoke unto me, and who swore unto me, saying, 'To thee will I give this land, and to thy seed,' He Himself shall send His angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife for my son Isaac from thence.
8 But if the woman be not willing to come with thee unto this land, then shalt thou be clear from this mine oath. Only my son shalt thou not bring back thither."
9 And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore unto him concerning this matter.

10 Then the servant took ten camels from among the camels of his master, and from all the goodly things of his master with him. And rising up, he journeyed to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.
11 And he made the camels kneel down outside the city, by the well of water that was in sight, at the time when the women who drew water were coming forth.
12 And he said, "O Lord, the God of my master Abraham, grant me good speed this day, and show mercy unto my master Abraham.
13 Behold, I stand here by the spring of water, and the daughters of the men of the city come forth to draw water.
14 And it shall come to pass, that the maiden to whomsoever I shall say, 'Incline thy jar, that I may drink,' and she shall say unto me, 'Drink thou, and thy camels will I water, until they shall cease from drinking'—her hast Thou prepared for Thy servant Isaac. And by this shall I know that Thou hast shown mercy unto my master Abraham."

15 And it came to pass, before he had finished speaking in his mind, that behold, Rebekah came forth, she who was born of Bethuel, [the] son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, and Abraham's brother, with her jar upon her shoulders.
16 Now the maiden was exceedingly beautiful to look upon; she was a virgin, and no man had known her. And she went down to the spring, and filled her jar, and came up.
17 And the servant ran to meet her and said, "Give me, I pray thee, a little water from thy jar."
18 And she said, "Drink, Sir." And she hastened and let down her jar upon her arm, and gave him drink, until he had ceased drinking.
19 And she said, "And for thy camels also will I draw water, until all of them have drunk."
20 And she hastened and emptied her jar into the watering trough, and ran again to the well to draw [water], and drew water
