6 εἰς τὸν τόπον τοῦτον· καὶ ὅσα ἐποίησε τῷ Δαθὰν καὶ Ἀβειρὼν
υἱοῖς Ἐλιὰβ υἱοῦ Ῥουβὴν, οὓς ἀνοίξασα ἡ γῆ τὸ στόμα αὐτῆς
κατέπιεν αὐτοὺς, καὶ τοὺς οἴκους αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰς σκηνὰς αὐτῶν,
καὶ πᾶσαν αὐτῶν τὴν ὑπόστασιν τὴν μετ᾿ αὐτῶν, ἐν μέσῳ παν-
7 τὸς Ἰσραήλ· ὅτι οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ ὑμῶν ἑώρων πάντα τὰ ἔργα Κυρίου
8 τὰ μεγάλα, ὅσα ἐποίησεν ὑμῖν σήμερον. Καὶ φυλάσσεσθε πάσας
τὰς ἐντολὰς αὐτοῦ, ὅσας ἐγὼ ἐντέλλομαι ὑμῖν σήμερον, ἵνα ζήτε,
καὶ πολυπλασιασθῆτε, καὶ εἰσέλθητε καὶ κληρονομήσητε τὴν γῆν,
εἰς ἣν ὑμεῖς διαβήνετε τὸν Ἰορδάνην ἐκεῖ, κληρονομῆσαι αὐτήν·
9 ἵνα μακροημερεύσητε ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, ἧς ὤμοσε Κύριος τοῖς πα-
τράσιν ὑμῶν, δοῦναι αὐτοῖς καὶ τῷ σπέρματι αὐτῶν μετ᾿ αὐτοὺς,
10 γῆν ῥέουσαν γάλα καὶ μέλι. Ἔστι γὰρ ἡ γῆ εἰς ἣν εἰσπορεύεσθε
ὑμεῖς ἐκεῖ, κληρονομῆσαι αὐτὴν, οὐχ ὥσπερ ἡ γῆ Αἰγύπτου, ὅθεν
ἐξεπορεύεσθε ἐκεῖθεν, ὅταν σπείρωσι τὸν σπόρον σου, καὶ ποτίζωσι
11 τοῖς ποσί σου, ὡσεὶ κῆπον λαχανείας· ἡ δὲ γῆ εἰς ἣν σὺ εἴσπο-
ρεύῃ ἐκεῖ, κληρονομῆσαι αὐτὴν, γῆ ὀρεινὴ καὶ πεδινὴ, ἐκ τοῦ ὑε-
12 τοῦ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ πίεται ὕδωρ· γῆ, ἣν Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου ἐπισκο-
πεῖται αὐτὴν διαπαντὸς, οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ σου ἐπ᾿
αὐτῆς ἀπ᾿ ἀρχῆς τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ καὶ ἕως τῆς συντελείας τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ.
13 Ἐὰν δὲ ἀκοῇ ἀκούσητε πάσας τὰς ἐντολὰς αὐτοῦ, ὅσας
ἐγὼ ἐντέλλομαί σοι σήμερον, ἀγαπᾷν Κύριον τὸν Θεόν σου, καὶ
λατρεύειν αὐτῷ ἐξ ὅλης τῆς καρδίας σου, καὶ ἐξ ὅλης τῆς ψυχῆς
14 σου, καὶ δώσει τὸν ὑετὸν τῆς γῆς σου καθ᾿ ὥραν πρώιμον καὶ ὄψι-
μον, καὶ εἰσοίσεις τὸν σῖτόν σου, καὶ τὸν οἶνόν σου, καὶ
15 τὸ ἔλαιόν σου· καὶ δώσεις χορτάσματα ἐν τοῖς ἀγροῖς σου (καὶ
16 ἐν) τοῖς κτήνεσί σου. Καὶ φαγὼν, καὶ ἐμπλησθεὶς, πρόσεχε σεαυ-
τῷ, μὴ πλατυνθῇ ἡ καρδία σου, καὶ παραβῆτε, καὶ λατρεύσητε
17 θεοῖς ἑτέροις, καὶ προσκυνήσητε αὐτοῖς· καὶ θυμωθεὶς ὀργισθῇ Κύ-
ριος ἐφ᾿ ὑμῖν, καὶ συσχῇ τὸν οὐρανὸν, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ὑετὸς, καὶ
ἡ γῆ οὐ δώσει τὸν καρπὸν αὐτῆς, καὶ ἀπολεῖσθε ἐν τάχει ἀπὸ
18 τῆς γῆς τῆς ἀγαθῆς, ἧς ἔδωκεν ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῖν. Καὶ ἐμβαλεῖτε τὰ
ῥήματά μου ταῦτα εἰς τὴν καρδίαν ὑμῶν καὶ εἰς τὴν ψυχὴν ὑ-
μῶν, καὶ ἀφάψετε αὐτὰ εἰς σημεῖον ἐπὶ τῆς χειρὸς ὑμῶν, καὶ
19 ἔσται ἀσάλευτον πρὸ ὀφθαλμῶν ὑμῶν· καὶ διδάξετε αὐτὰ τὰ τέ-
κνα ὑμῶν λαλεῖν αὐτὰ, καθημένου σου ἐν οἴκῳ σου, καὶ πορευο-
μένου σου ἐν ὁδῷ, καὶ κοιταζομένου σου, καὶ διανισταμένου σου,

**DEUTERONOMY, CHAPTER 11**

**6** unto this place; and whatsoever He wrought unto Dathan and Abiram,
the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben; whom the earth opened her mouth
and swallowed them up, and their houses, and their tents,
and all their substance that [was] with them, in the midst of all Israel.
**7** For your eyes have seen all the great works of the Lord,
which He hath done for you this day.
**8** Therefore shall ye keep all His commandments, whatsoever I command you this day,
that ye may live and be multiplied, and may enter in and inherit the land,
into which ye pass over the Jordan there, to inherit it;
**9** that ye may long endure upon the land, which the Lord swore unto your fathers,
to give unto them and unto their seed after them,
a land flowing with milk and honey.
**10** For the land, whither ye go in there to inherit it,
is not as the land of Egypt, whence ye went out from thence,
when they sow thy seed, and water it with thy feet, as a garden of herbs.
**11** But the land into which thou goest there, to inherit it,
is a land of mountains and valleys, which shall drink water
from the rain of heaven;
**12** a land, which the Lord thy God doth continually care for it;
the eyes of the Lord thy God are upon it from the beginning of the year
even unto the end of the year.
**13** And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken unto all His commandments,
which I command thee this day, to love the Lord thy God,
and to serve Him with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,
**14** that He shall give the rain of thy land in its season,
the early and the latter rain, and thou shalt bring in thy corn,
and thy wine, and thy oil;
**15** and He shall give grasses in thy fields (and in) thy cattle.
**16** And when thou hast eaten, and art filled, take heed to thyself,
lest thy heart be enlarged, and ye transgress, and serve other gods,
and worship them;
**17** and the Lord be moved to wrath and be angry with you,
and He shut up the heaven, and there shall be no rain,
and the earth shall not give her fruit,
and ye shall perish quickly from the good land, which God hath given unto you.
**18** And ye shall lay up these My words in your heart and in your soul,
and ye shall bind them as a sign upon your hand,
and they shall be as an unshaken [sign] before your eyes;
**19** and ye shall teach them to your children to speak them,
when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest in the way,
and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up;
