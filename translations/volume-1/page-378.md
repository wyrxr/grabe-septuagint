παιδίσκας, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ὁ κτώμενος.

1 ΟΥΤΟΙ οἱ λόγοι τῆς διαθήκης, ἧς ἐνετείλατο Κύριος τῷ
Μωυσῇ στῆσαι τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραὴλ ἐν γῇ Μωάβ, πλὴν τῆς διαθή-
κης ἧς διέθετο αὐτοῖς ἐν Χωρήβ.
2 Καὶ ἐκάλεσε Μωυσῆς πάντας υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτούς· ὑμεῖς ἑωράκατε πάντα ὅσα
ἐποίησε Κύριος ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ ἐνώπιον ὑμῶν, Φαραὼ καὶ πᾶσι
τοῖς θεράπουσιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάσῃ τῇ γῇ αὐτοῦ,
3 τοὺς πειρασμοὺς τοὺς μεγάλους οὓς εἶδον οἱ ὀφθαλμοί σου, τὰ σημεῖα καὶ τὰ τέ-
ρατα τὰ μεγάλα ἐκεῖνα (τὴν χεῖρα τὴν κραταιὰν, καὶ τὸν βραχί-
ονα τὸν ὑψηλόν.)
4 Καὶ οὐκ ἔδωκε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῖν καρδίαν εἰ-
δέναι, καὶ ὀφθαλμοὺς τοῦ βλέπειν, καὶ τὰ ὦτα ἀκούειν, ἕως τῆς ἡ-
μέρας ταύτης.
5 Καὶ ἤγαγεν ὑμᾶς τεσσαράκοντα ἔτη ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ·
οὐκ ἐπαλαιώθησαν τὰ ἱμάτια ὑμῶν ἐπάνωθεν ὑμῶν, καὶ τὰ ὑποδή-
ματα ὑμῶν οὐ κατετρίβη ἀπὸ τῶν ποδῶν ὑμῶν·
6 ἄρτον οὐκ ἐφά-
γετε, οἶνον καὶ σίκερα οὐκ ἐπίετε, ἵνα γνῶτε ὅτι οὗτος Κύριος
ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν.
7 Καὶ ἤλθετε ἕως τοῦ τόπου τούτου, καὶ ἐξῆλθε
Σηὼν βασιλεὺς Ἑσεβὼν καὶ Ὤγ βασιλεὺς τῆς Βασὰν εἰς συνάν-
τησιν ἡμῖν ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ, καὶ ἐπατάξαμεν αὐτούς·
8 καὶ ἐλάβομεν τὴν
γῆν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔδωκα αὐτὴν ἐν κλήρῳ τῷ Ῥουβὴν, καὶ τῷ Γαδδεὶ, καὶ τῷ ἡμίσει φυλῆς Μανασσῆ.
9 Καὶ φυλάξεσθε (ποιεῖν) πάν-
τας τοὺς λόγους τῆς διαθήκης ταύτης ποιεῖν αὐτοὺς, ἵνα συνῆτε
πάντα ὅσα ποιήσητε.
10 Ὑμεῖς ἑστήκατε σήμερον πάντες ἔναντι Κυ-
ρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ὑμῶν, οἱ ἀρχίφυλοι ὑμῶν, καὶ ἡ γερουσία ὑμῶν,
καὶ οἱ κριταὶ ὑμῶν, καὶ οἱ γραμματοεισαγωγεῖς ὑμῶν, πᾶς ἀνὴρ
Ἰσραὴλ,
11 (καὶ) αἱ γυναῖκες ὑμῶν, καὶ τὰ τέκνα ὑμῶν, καὶ ὁ προσ-
ήλυτος ὑμῶν ὁ ἐν μέσῳ τῆς παρεμβολῆς ὑμῶν, ἀπὸ ξυλοκόπου
ὑμῶν ἕως ὑδροφόρου ὑμῶν,
12 παρελθεῖν σε ἐν τῇ διαθήκῃ Κυρίου
τοῦ Θεοῦ σου, καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἀραῖς αὐτοῦ, ὅσα Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου
διατίθεται πρὸς σὲ σήμερον·
13 ἵνα στήσῃ σε σήμερον ἑαυτῷ εἰς λαὸν,
καὶ αὐτὸς ἔσται σου Θεὸς, ὃν τρόπον εἶπέ σοι, καὶ ὃν τρόπον ὤ-
μοσε τοῖς πατράσι σου, Ἀβραὰμ καὶ Ἰσαὰκ καὶ Ἰακώβ.
14 Καὶ
οὐχ ὑμῖν μόνοις ἐγὼ διατίθεμαι τὴν διαθήκην ταύτην καὶ τὴν ἀ-

**Deuteronomy 28**
68 [that] land; and there shall ye be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and for bondwomen, and there shall be no man to acquire [you].

**Deuteronomy 29**
1 These are the words of the covenant, which the Lord commanded Moses to establish with the sons of Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant which He made with them in Horeb.
2 And Moses called all the sons of Israel, and said unto them, "Ye have seen all that the Lord did in the land of Egypt before your eyes, unto Pharaoh and unto all his servants, and unto all his land;
3 the great trials which thine eyes have seen, those great signs and wonders (the mighty hand, and the high arm).
4 Yet the Lord your God hath not given you a heart to understand, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day.
5 And I have led you forty years in the wilderness; your garments have not grown old upon you, and your sandals have not worn out from off your feet.
6 Bread ye have not eaten, wine and strong drink ye have not drunk, that ye might know that this is the Lord your God.
7 And ye came unto this place; and Sihon the king of Heshbon and Og the king of Bashan came forth to meet us in battle, and we smote them.
8 And we took their land, and I gave it as an inheritance unto Reuben, and unto Gad, and unto the half-tribe of Manasseh.
9 Therefore shall ye keep (to do) all the words of this covenant, to do them, that ye may understand all that ye do.
10 Ye stand this day, all of you, before the Lord your God: your chieftains, and your elders, and your judges, and your officers, every man of Israel,
11 (and) your wives, and your children, and your sojourner who is in the midst of your camp, from your hewer of wood even unto your drawer of water;
12 that thou shouldst enter into the covenant of the Lord thy God, and into His curses, which the Lord thy God maketh with thee this day;
13 that He may establish thee this day for Himself as a people, and that He may be unto thee a God, as He hath said unto thee, and as He hath sworn unto thy fathers, Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob.
14 And not with you alone do I make this covenant and this curse,
