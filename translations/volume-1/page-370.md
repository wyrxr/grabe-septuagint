ΚΕΦ. ΚΕ΄. Κς΄. ΔΕΥΤΕΡΟΝΟΜΙΟΝ 355
μέγα καὶ μικρὸν στάθμιον ἀληθινὸν καὶ δίκαιον ἔσται σοι, καὶ μέ- 15
τρον ἀληθινὸν καὶ δίκαιον ἔσται σοι, ἵνα πολυήμερος γένῃ ἐπὶ τῆς
γῆς, ἧς Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου δίδωσι σοι ἐν κλήρῳ· ὅτι βδέλυγμα 16
Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ σου ἐστὶ πᾶς ποιῶν ταῦτα, πᾶς ποιῶν ἄδικον.
Μνήσθητι ὅσα ἐποίησέ σοι Ἀμαλὴκ ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ, ἐκπορευομένου σου 17
ἐξ Αἰγύπτου· πῶς ἀντέστη σοι ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ, καὶ ἐκοψέ σου τὴν οὐ- 18
ραγίαν, πάντας τοὺς κοπιῶντας ὀπίσω σου· σὺ δὲ ἐπείνας καὶ ἐκο-
πίας, καὶ οὐκ ἐφοβήθη τὸν Θεόν· καὶ ἔσται ἡνίκα ἐὰν καταπαύ- 19
σῃ σε Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν ἐχθρῶν σου τῶν κύ-
κλῳ σου ἐν τῇ γῇ, ᾗ Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου δίδωσι σοι ἐν κλήρῳ,
κατακληρονομήσαι αὐτήν, ἐξαλείψεις τὸ ὄνομα Ἀμαλὴκ ἐκ τῆς
ὑπὸ τὸν οὐρανόν, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἐπιλάθῃ.

ΚΕΦ. Κς΄. XXVI.

ΚΑΙ ἔσται ἐὰν εἰσέλθῃς εἰς τὴν γῆν, ἣν Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου 1
δίδωσι σοι ἐν κλήρῳ, κατακληρονομήσαι αὐτήν, καὶ κατοικήσῃς ἐπ᾿
αὐτῆς, καὶ λήψῃ ἀπὸ τῆς ἀπαρχῆς πάντων τῶν καρπῶν τῆς γῆς, 2
ὅσα ἂν ἐνέγκῃς ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς σου, ἣν Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου δίδωσι
σοι ἐν κλήρῳ, καὶ ἐμβαλεῖς εἰς κάρταλλον, καὶ πορεύσῃ εἰς τὸν
τόπον, ὃν ἂν ἐκλέξηται Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου, ἐπικληθῆναι τὸ ὄνο-
μα αὐτοῦ ἐκεῖ· καὶ ἐλεύσῃ πρὸς τὸν ἱερέα, ὃς ἂν ᾖ ἐν ταῖς ἡ- 3
μέραις ἐκείναις, καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτόν· ἀναγγέλλω σήμερον Κυρίῳ
τῷ Θεῷ σου, ὅτι εἰσελήλυθα εἰς τὴν γῆν, ἣν ὤμοσε Κύριος τοῖς
πατράσιν ἡμῶν, δοῦναι ἡμῖν. Καὶ λήψεται ὁ ἱερεὺς τὸν κάρταλ- 4
λον ἐκ τῶν χειρῶν σου, καὶ θήσει αὐτὸν ἀπέναντι τοῦ θυσιαστη-
ρίου Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ σου· καὶ ἀποκριθήσῃ, καὶ ἐρεῖς ἔναντι Κυ- 5
ρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ σου· Συρίαν ἀπέβαλεν ὁ πατήρ μου, καὶ κατέβη εἰς
Αἴγυπτον, καὶ παρῴκησεν ἐκεῖ ἐν ἀριθμῷ βραχεῖ, καὶ ἐγένετο ἐκεῖ
εἰς ἔθνος μέγα καὶ πλῆθος πολὺ καὶ μέγα. Καὶ ἐκάκωσαν ἡμᾶς 6
οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι, καὶ ἐταπείνωσαν ἡμᾶς, καὶ ἐπέθηκαν ἡμῖν ἔργα
σκληρά· καὶ ἀνεβοήσαμεν πρὸς Κύριον τὸν Θεὸν τῶν πατέρων ἡ- 7
μῶν, καὶ εἰσήκουσε Κύριος τῆς φωνῆς ἡμῶν, καὶ εἶδε τὴν ταπεί-
νωσιν ἡμῶν, καὶ τὸν μόχθον ἡμῶν, καὶ τὸν θλιμμὸν ἡμῶν· καὶ 8
ἐξήγαγεν ἡμᾶς Κύριος ἐξ Αἰγύπτου αὐτὸς ἐν ἰσχύϊ μεγάλῃ, καὶ
ἐν χειρὶ κραταιᾷ, καὶ ἐν βραχίονι αὐτοῦ τῷ ὑψηλῷ, καὶ ἐν ὁρά-

DEUTERONOMY
CHAPTER XXV.

15 A great and a small weight, true and just, shall be for thee, and a true and just measure shall be for thee, that thy days may be prolonged upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.
16 For an abomination unto the Lord thy God is every one that doeth these things, even every one that worketh injustice.
17 Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way, when thou camest forth out of Egypt;
18 How he withstood thee in the way, and smote of thee the rearguard, even all those that were weary behind thee; and thou wast hungry and faint, yet he feared not God.
19 And it shall be, when the Lord thy God shall give thee rest from all thine enemies round about thee in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, to possess it, that thou shalt blot out the name of Amalek from under heaven; and thou shalt not forget.

CHAPTER XXVI.

1 And it shall be, when thou shalt come into the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, to possess it, and thou shalt dwell therein,
2 Then shalt thou take of the first of all the fruits of the land, whatsoever thou shalt bring forth from thy land which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and thou shalt put them into a basket, and shalt go unto the place which the Lord thy God shall choose, for His Name to be called there.
3 And thou shalt come unto the priest that shall be in those days, and shalt say unto him: "I declare this day unto the Lord thy God, that I am come into the land which the Lord sware unto our fathers to give us."
4 And the priest shall take the basket from thy hands, and shall set it before the altar of the Lord thy God.
5 And thou shalt answer and say before the Lord thy God: "My father hath rejected Syria, and went down into Egypt, and sojourned there with few in number, and became there a nation great and a multitude both large and great.
6 And the Egyptians afflicted us, and humbled us, and laid upon us hard labors.
7 And we cried unto the Lord, the God of our fathers, and the Lord heard our voice, and beheld our humiliation, and our toil, and our oppression.
8 And the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt Himself, with great strength, and with a mighty hand, and with His high arm, and with great visions,
