1 ΚΑὶ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν καὶ Ἀαρών, λέγων· λά- 2
βε τὸ κεφάλαιον τῶν υἱῶν Καὰθ ἐκ μέσου υἱῶν Λευὶ, κατὰ δή-
μους αὐτῶν, κατ᾿ οἴκους πατριῶν αὐτῶν, ἀπὸ εἰκοσαετοῦς καὶ 3
ἐπάνω ἕως υἱοῦ πεντήκοντα ἐτῶν, πᾶς ὁ εἰσπορευόμενος λειτουρ-
γεῖν ποιῆσαι πάντα τὰ ἔργα ἐν τῇ σκηνῇ τοῦ μαρτυρίου. Καὶ 4
ταῦτα τὰ ἔργα τῶν υἱῶν Καὰθ ἐκ μέσου υἱῶν Λευὶ, κατὰ δή-
μους αὐτῶν, κατ᾿ οἴκους πατριῶν αὐτῶν, ἐν τῇ σκηνῇ τοῦ μαρ-
τυρίου, ἅγιον τῶν ἁγίων. Καὶ εἰσελεύσονται Ἀαρὼν καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ 5
αὐτοῦ, ὅταν ἐξαίρῃ ἡ παρεμβολή, καὶ καθελοῦσι τὸ καταπέτασμα
τὸ συσκιάζον, καὶ κατακαλύψουσιν ἐν αὐτῷ τὴν κιβωτὸν τοῦ μαρ-
τυρίου· καὶ ἐπιθήσουσιν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸ κατακάλυμμα δέρμα ὑακίνθινον, 6
καὶ ἐπιβαλοῦσιν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὴν ἱμάτιον ὅλον ὑακίνθινον ἄνωθεν, καὶ
διεμβαλοῦσι τοὺς ἀναφορεῖς αὐτῆς· καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν τράπεζαν τὴν προ- 7
κειμένην ἐπιβαλοῦσιν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὴν ἱμάτιον ὁλοπόρφυρον, καὶ δώσουσιν
ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς τὰ τρυβλία, καὶ τὰς θυΐσκας, καὶ τοὺς κυάθους, καὶ
τὰ σπονδεῖα ἐν οἷς σπένδει, καὶ οἱ ἄρτοι οἱ διαπαντὸς ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς
ἔσονται· καὶ ἐπιβαλοῦσιν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὴν ἱμάτιον κόκκινον διάφορον, καὶ 8
καλύψουσιν αὐτὴν καλύμματι δερματίνῳ ὑακινθίνῳ, καὶ διεμβαλοῦσι
τοὺς ἀναφορεῖς αὐτῆς· καὶ λήψονται ἱμάτιον ὑακίνθινον, καὶ κα- 9
λύψουσι τὴν λυχνίαν τὴν φωτίζουσαν, καὶ τοὺς λύχνους αὐτῆς,
καὶ τὰς λαβίδας αὐτῆς, καὶ τὰς ἐπαρυστρίδας αὐτῆς, καὶ πάντα
τὰ ἀγγεῖα τοῦ ἐλαίου αὐτῆς, ὅσοις λειτουργοῦσιν αὐτῇ ἐν αὐτοῖς·
καὶ ἐμβαλοῦσιν αὐτὴν καὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη αὐτῆς εἰς κάλυμμα 10
δερμάτινον ὑακίνθινον, καὶ ἐπιθήσουσιν αὐτὴν ἐπ᾿ ἀναφορέων· καὶ 11
ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον τὸ χρυσοῦν ἐπικαλύψουσιν ἱμάτιον ὑακίνθινον,
καὶ ἐπικαλύψουσιν αὐτὸ καλύμματι, δέρματι ὑακινθίνῳ, καὶ διεμ-
βαλοῦσι τοὺς ἀναφορεῖς αὐτοῦ· καὶ λήψονται πάντα τὰ σκεύη τὰ 12
λειτουργικὰ, ὅσα λειτουργοῦσιν ἐν αὐτοῖς ἐν τοῖς ἁγίοις, καὶ ἐμ-
βαλοῦσιν εἰς ἱμάτιον ὑακίνθινον, καὶ καλύψουσιν αὐτὰ καλύμματι,
δέρματι ὑακινθίνῳ, καὶ ἐπιθήσουσιν ἐπὶ ἀναφορεῖς· καὶ ἐπιθήσεις 13
