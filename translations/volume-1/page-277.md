8 δὴ τὸν τρίτον τοῦ ἑνὸς προσσίσετε εἰς ὀσμὴν εὐωδίας Κυρίῳ. Ἐὰν
   δὲ ποιήτητε ἀπὸ τῶν βοῶν (ποιήσητε) εἰς ὁλοκαύτωμα ἢ εἰς θυσίαν,
9 μεγαλῦναι εὐχὴν ἢ εἰς σωτήριον Κυρίῳ, καὶ προσσίσει ἐπὶ τοῦ
   μόσχου θυσίαν σεμιδάλεως τρία δέκατα ἀναπεφυραμένης ἐν ἐλαίῳ
10 ἥμισυ τοῦ ἑνὸς καὶ οἶνον προσσίσει εἰς σπονδὴν τὸ ἥμισυ τοῦ ἑνός,
11 κάρπωμα ὀσμὴν εὐωδίας Κυρίῳ. Οὕτω ποιήσει τῷ μόσχῳ τῷ
   ἑνί, ἢ τῷ κριῷ τῷ ἑνί, ἢ τῷ ἀμνῷ τῷ ἑνὶ ἐκ τῶν προβάτων,
12 ἢ ἐκ τῶν αἰγῶν· κατὰ τὸν ἀριθμὸν ὃν ποιήσητε, οὕτω ποιήσετε
13 τῷ ἑνὶ κατὰ τὸν ἀριθμὸν αὐτῶν. Πᾶς ὁ αὐτόχθων ποιήσει οὕτω
14 τοιαῦτα προσενέγκαι καρπώματα εἰς ὀσμὴν εὐωδίας Κυρίῳ. Ἐὰν
   δὲ προσήλυτος ἐν ὑμῖν προσγένηται ἐν τῇ γῇ ὑμῶν, ἢ ὃς ἂν γένη-
   ται ἐν ὑμῖν ἐν ταῖς γενεαῖς ὑμῶν, καὶ ποιήσῃ κάρπωμα ὀσμὴν
   εὐωδίας Κυρίῳ, ὃν τρόπον ποιεῖτε ὑμεῖς, οὕτω ποιήσει ἡ συνα-
15 γωγὴ Κυρίῳ, νόμος εἷς (ἔσται) ὑμῖν καὶ τοῖς προσηλύτοις τοῖς
   προσκειμένοις ἐν ὑμῖν, νόμος αἰώνιος εἰς τὰς γενεὰς ὑμῶν· ὡς
16 ὑμεῖς, καὶ ὁ προσήλυτος ἔσται ἔναντι Κυρίου· νόμος εἷς (ἔσται)
   καὶ δικαίωμα ἓν ἔσται ὑμῖν καὶ τῷ προσηλύτῳ τῷ προσκειμένῳ
17 ἐν ὑμῖν. Καὶ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, λέγων· 18 λάλησον τοῖς
   υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτούς· ἐν τῷ εἰσπορεύεσθαι ὑμᾶς
19 εἰς τὴν γῆν, εἰς ἣν ἐγὼ εἰσάγω ὑμᾶς ἐκεῖ, καὶ ἔσται ὅταν ἔσθητε
   ὑμεῖς ἀπὸ τῶν ἄρτων τῆς γῆς, ἀφελεῖτε ἀφαίρεμα ἀφόρισμα τῷ
20 Κυρίῳ, ἀπαρχὴν φυράματος ὑμῶν, ἄρτον ἀφαίρεμα ἀφοριεῖτε αὐτόν.
21 ὡς ἀφαίρεμα (ἀπὸ) ἅλωνος, οὕτως ἀφελεῖτε αὐτὸν (ἄρτον)· ἀπαρ-
   χὴν φυράματος ὑμῶν, καὶ δώσετε Κυρίῳ ἀφαίρεμα εἰς τὰς γε-
22 νεὰς ὑμῶν. Ὅταν δὲ διαμάρτητε καὶ μὴ ποιήσητε πάσας τὰς ἐν-
23 τολὰς ταύτας, ἃς ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, κατὰ πάντα, ἃ
   συνέταξε Κύριος ὑμῖν ἐν χειρὶ Μωυσῆ, ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέρας ἧς συνέ-
24 ταξε Κύριος πρὸς ὑμᾶς, καὶ ἐπέκεινα εἰς τὰς γενεὰς ὑμῶν, καὶ
   ἔσται ἐὰν ἐξ ὀφθαλμῶν τῆς συναγωγῆς γενηθῇ ἀκουσίως, καὶ ποι-
   ήσει πᾶσα ἡ συναγωγὴ μόσχον (ἕνα) ἐκ βοῶν ἄμωμον εἰς ὁλο-
   καύτωμα, εἰς ὀσμὴν εὐωδίας Κυρίῳ, καὶ θυσίαν τούτου καὶ σπονδὴν
   αὐτοῦ κατὰ τὴν σύνταξιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ χίμαρον ἐξ αἰγῶν ἕνα περὶ
25 ἁμαρτίας· καὶ ἐξιλάσεται ὁ ἱερεὺς περὶ πάσης συναγωγῆς υἱῶν
   Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἀφεθήσεται αὐτοῖς, ὅτι ἀκούσιόν ἐστι, καὶ αὐτοὶ ἤ-
   νεγκαν τὸ δῶρον αὐτῶν, κάρπωμα Κυρίῳ περὶ τῆς ἁμαρτίας αὐ-
26 τῶν ἔναντι Κυρίου περὶ τῶν ἀκουσίων αὐτῶν, καὶ ἀφεθήσεται

**Numbers Chapter 15**

8
Then the third [part] of a hin shall ye offer
for a sweet savour unto the Lord.
And if ye prepare from the oxen (if ye prepare)
for a burnt offering, or for a sacrifice,
9
To fulfill a vow, or for a peace offering unto the Lord,
then shall ye offer upon the calf a meal offering
of fine flour, three tenth [parts],
mingled with oil,
10
The half of a hin;
and wine shall ye offer for a drink offering,
the half of a hin.
11
[This shall be] an offering of a sweet savour unto the Lord.
Thus shall he do for the one calf,
or for the one ram,
or for the one lamb of the sheep,
12
Or from the goats:
according to the number which ye shall prepare,
so shall ye do for each one according to their number.
13
Every native-born [person] shall do thus
14
Such like offerings for a sweet savour unto the Lord.
And if a proselyte shall sojourn among you in your land,
or whosoever shall be among you in your generations,
and shall offer an offering of a sweet savour unto the Lord,
in the manner which ye do,
so shall the congregation [do] unto the Lord.
15
One law (shall be) for you and for the proselytes
who dwell among you;
an everlasting law throughout your generations.
16
As ye [are], so shall the proselyte be before the Lord.
One law (shall be) and one ordinance
shall there be for you and for the proselyte
who dwelleth among you.

17
And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying:
18
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them:
When ye come in
19
into the land, into which I bring you thither,
and it shall be that when ye eat of the bread of the land,
then ye shall offer a separate heave offering unto the Lord,
20
The firstfruit of your dough, [even] a loaf.
A heave offering shall ye separate it.
21
As the heave offering [that is taken] from the threshing floor,
so shall ye offer it, [even] the loaf.
The firstfruit of your dough,
then shall ye give a heave offering
unto the Lord throughout your generations.

22
And when ye err,
and do not all these commandments,
23
Which the Lord spake unto Moses,
[even] according to all that the Lord commanded you
by the hand of Moses,
from the day that the Lord commanded you,
24
And thereafter throughout your generations:
And it shall be, if through inadvertence [it be done]
out of the sight of the congregation,
then all the congregation shall offer a calf (one)
of the herd, unblemished, for a burnt offering,
for a sweet savour unto the Lord;
and its meal offering and its drink offering
according to its ordinance,
and one kid of the goats for
25
A sin offering.
And the priest shall make atonement
for all the congregation of the children of Israel;
and it shall be forgiven them,
for it is done through ignorance;
and they shall bring their gift,
an offering unto the Lord for their sin,
26
Before the Lord concerning their unintentional [sins];
and it shall be forgiven.
