εἶπε πρὸς αὐτούς· οὕτως καὶ οὕτως ἐποίησέ μοι Μειχά, καὶ
5 ἐμισθώσατό με, καὶ ἐγενήθην αὐτῷ εἰς ἱερέα. Καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῷ·
  ἐπερωτήσον δὴ ἐν τῷ Θεῷ, καὶ γνωσόμεθα, εἰ κατευοδοῖ ἡ ὁδὸς
6 ἡμῶν, ἣν ἡμεῖς πορευόμεθα ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς ὁ ἱε-
  ρεύς· πορεύεσθε (καὶ) εἰς εἰρήνην· ἐνώπιον Κυρίου ἡ ὁδὸς ὑμῶν,
7 καθ᾿ ἣν ὑμεῖς πορεύεσθε ἐν αὐτῇ. Καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν οἱ πέντε ἄν-
  δρες, καὶ παρεγένοντο εἰς Λαισά· καὶ ἴδον τὸν λαὸν τὸν κατοι-
  κοῦντα ἐν αὐτῇ καθήμενον ἐν ἐλπίδι κατὰ τὴν σύγκρισιν τῶν Σι-
  δωνίων, ἡσυχάζοντας ἐν ἐλπίδι, καὶ μὴ δυναμένους λαλῆσαι ῥῆμα
  ἐν τῇ γῇ, κληρονόμος θησαυροῦ· ὅτι μακράν εἰσιν ἀπὸ Σιδῶνος,
8 καὶ λόγος οὐκ ἦν αὐτοῖς μετὰ Συρίας. Καὶ παρεγένοντο οἱ πέν-
  τε ἄνδρες πρὸς τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτῶν εἰς Σαραὰ καὶ Ἐσθαάλ,
9 καὶ ἔλεγον αὐτοῖς οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτῶν· τί ὑμεῖς κάθησθε; Καὶ εἶ-
  παν· ἀνάστητε καὶ ἀναβῶμεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτήν· ὅτι εἰσήλθαμεν καὶ ἐνεπε-
  ριπατήσαμεν ἐν τῇ γῇ ἕως σιγῆσαι, καὶ ἴδομεν τὸν λαὸν τὸν
  κατοικοῦντα ἐν αὐτῇ ἐν ἐλπίδι κατὰ σύγκριμα τῶν Σιδωνίων·
  καὶ μακρὰν ἀπέχοντες ἐκ Σιδῶνος, καὶ λόγος οὐκ ἦν αὐτοῖς με-
  τὰ Συρίας· ἀλλὰ ἀνάστητε καὶ ἀναβῶμεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτούς· ὅτι εὑρή-
  καμεν τὴν γῆν, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἀγαθὴ σφόδρα, καὶ ὑμεῖς σιωπᾶτε· μὴ
  ὀκνήσητε τοῦ πορευθῆναι τοῦ ἐλθεῖν τοῦ κατακληρονομῆσαι τὴν γῆν.
10 Ἡνίκα ἂν εἰσέλθητε, ἕξετε πρὸς λαὸν πεποιθότα, καὶ ἡ γῆ εὐ-
  ρύχωρος χερσίν· ὅτι παρέδωκεν αὐτὴν ὁ Θεὸς ἐν χειρὶ ὑμῶν,
  τόπος οὗ οὐκ ἔστιν ἐκεῖ ὑστέρημα παντὸς ῥήματος ὅσα ἐν τῇ γῇ.
11 Καὶ ἀπῆραν ἐκεῖθεν ἐκ συγγενείας τοῦ Δάν, ἐκ Σαραὰ καὶ Ἐσθα-
12 ἀλ, ἑξακόσιοι ἄνδρες περιεζωσμένοι σκεύη πολεμικά. Καὶ ἀνέβη-
  σαν, καὶ παρενεβάλοσαν ἐν Καριαθιαρεὶμ ἐν Ἰούδα· διὰ τοῦτο ἐ-
  κλήθη τῷ τόπῳ ἐκείνῳ, παρεμβολὴ Δάν, ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης.
13 ἰδοὺ κατόπισθεν Καριαθιαρείμ. Παρελθὼν ἐκεῖθεν καὶ ἦλθεν ἕως τοῦ ὄ-
14 ρους Ἐφραίμ, καὶ ἦλθεν ἕως οἴκου Μειχά. Καὶ ἀπεκρίθησαν οἱ πέντε
  ἄνδρες οἱ πορευόμενοι κατασκεψάσθαι τὴν γῆν Λαισά, καὶ εἶπαν
  πρὸς τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτῶν· εἰ οἴδατε ὅτι ἔστιν ἐν τοῖς οἴκοις
  τούτοις Ἐφούδ, καὶ Θεραφείμ, καὶ γλυπτόν, καὶ χωνευτόν; καὶ
15 νῦν γνῶτε τί ποιήσετε. Καὶ ἐξέκλιναν ἐκεῖ, καὶ εἰσῆλθοσαν εἰς
  τὸν οἶκον τοῦ παιδαρίου τοῦ Λευίτου, εἰς τὸν οἶκον Μειχά, καὶ
16 ἠσπάσαντο αὐτὸν εἰς εἰρήνην. Καὶ οἱ ἑξακόσιοι ἄνδρες περιεζω-

### Judges Chapter 18

**4.** He said unto them, "Thus and thus hath Micah done unto me, and
**5.** he hath hired me, and I am become his priest." And they said unto him,
**6.** "Inquire, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way shall prosper, which we go." And the priest said unto them, "Go ye in peace: before the Lord is your way, wherein ye go."
**7.** And the five men departed, and came to Laish; and they saw the people that dwelt therein, sitting in confidence after the fashion of the Sidonians, quietly trusting, and none able to speak a word in the land, [being] inheritor of treasure; for they were far from Sidon, and there was no word for them with Syria.
**8.** And the five men returned unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol,
**9.** and their brethren said unto them, "Why sit ye thus?" And they said, "Arise, and let us go up against it; for we have entered and walked about in the land until [all was] silent, and have seen the people that dwell therein, in confidence, after the fashion of the Sidonians; and they are far distant from Sidon, and there is no word for them with Syria. But arise ye, and let us go up against them; for we have found the land, and, behold, it is very good. And ye are silent; hesitate not to go, to come, to inherit the land.
**10.** When ye go in, ye shall come upon a people in full trust, and the land is spacious in [its] hands; for God hath delivered it into your hand, a place where there is no lack of any thing whatsoever that is in the land."
**11.** And there departed thence from the family of Dan, from Zorah and Eshtaol,
**12.** six hundred men girded with implements of war. And they went up, and encamped in Kiriath-jearim in Judah; wherefore that place was called the Camp of Dan, unto this day.
**13.** Behold, behind Kiriath-jearim. And having passed from thence, he came unto Mount Ephraim, and came unto the house of Micah.
**14.** Then answered the five men that went to spy out the land of Laish, and said unto their brethren, "Know ye that there is in these houses an Ephod, and Teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? And
**15.** now consider what ye will do." And they turned aside thither, and entered into the house of the young man, the Levite, even into the house of Micah, and
**16.** they saluted him, [asking] of his peace. And the six hundred men girded with their implements of war, stood by the entrance of the gate.
