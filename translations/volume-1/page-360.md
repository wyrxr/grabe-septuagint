**ΚΕΦ. ΙΘʹ. Κʹ. ΔΕΥΤΕΡΟΝΟΜΙΟΝ 345**

αἵματος, καὶ ἀποθανεῖται· οὐ φείσεται ὁ ὀφθαλμός σου ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ, 13
καὶ καθαριεῖς τὸ αἷμα τὸ ἀναίτιον ἐξ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ εὖ σοι ἔσται. Οὐ 14
μετακινήσεις ὅρια τοῦ πλησίον σου, ἃ ἔστησαν οἱ πρότεροί σου ἐν
τῇ κληρονομίᾳ σου, ἣν κατεκληρονομήθης ἐν τῇ γῇ ἣν Κύριος ὁ
Θεός σου δίδωσί σοι ἐν κλήρῳ, κληρονομῆσαι αὐτήν. Οὐκ ἐμμενεῖ 15
μάρτυς εἷς μαρτυρῆσαι κατὰ ἀνθρώπου κατὰ πᾶσαν ἀδικίαν,
καὶ κατὰ πᾶν ἁμάρτημα, καὶ κατὰ πᾶσαν ἁμαρτίαν, ἣν ἐὰν ἁμάρ-
τῃ· ἐπὶ στόματος δύο μαρτύρων, καὶ ἐπὶ στόματος τριῶν μαρτύ-
ρων, σταθήσεται πᾶν ῥῆμα. Ἐὰν δὲ καταστῇ μάρτυς ἄδικος κατὰ 16
ἀνθρώπου, καταλέγων αὐτοῦ ἀσέβειαν, καὶ στήσονται οἱ δύο ἄν- 17
θρωποι, οἷς ἐστιν αὐτοῖς ἡ ἀντιλογία, ἔναντι Κυρίου, καὶ ἔναντι
τῶν ἱερέων, καὶ ἔναντι τῶν κριτῶν, οἳ ἂν ὦσιν ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις
ἐκείναις· καὶ ἐξετάσωσιν οἱ κριταὶ ἀκριβῶς, καὶ ἰδοὺ μάρτυς ἄδικος 18
ἐμαρτύρησεν ἄδικα, ἀντέστη κατὰ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ· καὶ ποιήσετε 19
αὐτῷ ὃν τρόπον ἐπονηρεύσατο τῷ πλησίον ποιῆσαι, καὶ ἐξαρεῖτε
τὸν πονηρὸν ἐξ ὑμῶν αὐτῶν· καὶ οἱ ἐπίλοιποι ἀκούσαντες 20
φοβηθήσονται, καὶ οὐ προσθήσουσιν ἔτι ποιεῖν κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα
τὸ πονηρὸν τοῦτο ἐν ὑμῖν· Οὐ φείσεται ὁ ὀφθαλμός σου ἐπ᾿ 21
αὐτῷ· ψυχὴν ἀντὶ ψυχῆς, ὀφθαλμὸν ἀντὶ ὀφθαλμοῦ, ὀδόντα ἀντὶ
ὀδόντος, χεῖρα ἀντὶ χειρός, πόδα ἀντὶ ποδός. (Καθότι ἂν δῷ μῶ-
μον τῷ πλησίον, οὕτως δοθήσεται αὐτῷ.)

**ΚΕΦ. Κʹ. ΧΧ.**

Ἐὰν δὲ ἐξέλθῃς εἰς πόλεμον ἐπὶ τοὺς ἐχθρούς σου, καὶ ἴδῃς 1
ἵππον καὶ ἀναβάτην καὶ λαὸν πλείονα σου, οὐ φοβηθήσῃ ἀπ᾿ αὐ-
τῶν· ὅτι Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου μετὰ σοῦ, ὁ ἀναβιβάσας σε ἐκ γῆς
Αἰγύπτου. Καὶ ἔσται ὅταν ἐγγίσῃς τῷ πολέμῳ, καὶ προσεγγίσας 2
ὁ ἱερεὺς λαλήσει τῷ λαῷ, καὶ ἐρεῖ πρὸς αὐτούς· ἄκουε Ἰσ- 3
ραήλ· ὑμεῖς προσπορεύεσθε σήμερον εἰς πόλεμον ἐπὶ τοὺς ἐχ-
θροὺς ὑμῶν· μὴ ἐκλυέσθω ἡ καρδία ὑμῶν, μὴ φοβεῖσθε, μηδὲ
θραύεσθε, μηδὲ ἐκκλίνητε ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτῶν· ὅτι Κύριος 4
ὁ Θεός ὑμῶν ὁ προπορευόμενος μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν, συνεκπολεμήσαι
ὑμῖν τοὺς ἐχθροὺς ὑμῶν, καὶ διασῶσαι ὑμᾶς. Καὶ λαλήσουσιν 5
οἱ γραμματεῖς πρὸς τὸν λαόν, λέγοντες· τίς ὁ ἄνθρωπος ὁ οἰκοδομήσας
οἰκίαν καινήν, καὶ οὐκ ἐνεκαίνισεν αὐτήν; πο-

### Literary English Translation

**DEUTERONOMY CHAPTER 19**

<sup>13</sup> [Thou shalt] take no pity on him, that his blood may be shed, and he shall die; and thou shalt purge the innocent blood from Israel, and it shall be well with thee.

<sup>14</sup> Thou shalt not remove thy neighbor’s landmark, which they of old time have set in thine inheritance, which thou hast inherited in the land that the LORD thy God doth give thee as an inheritance, to possess it.

<sup>15</sup> One witness shall not suffice to testify against any man concerning any injustice, or concerning any transgression, or concerning any sin, whatsoever he may commit; at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall every word be established.

<sup>16</sup> If an unrighteous witness shall rise up against a man, alleging against him impiety, <sup>17</sup> then shall the two men stand, between whom is the controversy, before the LORD, and before the priests, and before the judges, who shall be in those days; <sup>18</sup> and the judges shall inquire diligently; and behold, if the witness be a false witness, and hath borne false witness, [and] hath stood against his brother; <sup>19</sup> then shall ye do unto him as he maliciously purposed to do unto his neighbor, and ye shall purge the evil from among yourselves; <sup>20</sup> and the rest, when they hear, shall be afraid, and shall no more continue to do such an evil thing among you.

<sup>21</sup> Thine eye shall not pity him; but life for a life, eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth, hand for a hand, foot for a foot. (Even as he shall give a blemish to his neighbor, so shall it be given to him.)

**DEUTERONOMY CHAPTER 20**

<sup>1</sup> When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and thou seest horses and chariots, and a people more numerous than thyself, thou shalt not be afraid of them; for the LORD thy God is with thee, who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.

<sup>2</sup> And it shall be, when thou drawest nigh unto the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people, <sup>3</sup> and he shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel: Ye do approach this day unto battle against your enemies; let not your heart faint, neither be ye afraid, nor be dismayed, neither be ye terrified before them; <sup>4</sup> for the LORD your God, He who goeth before you, shall fight for you against your enemies, and shall save you.

<sup>5</sup> And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, Who is the man that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? Let him go forth and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man shall dedicate it.
