ΚΕΦ. Ἰ΄.
13 Αἰλών. Καὶ ἔστη δ᾽ ἥλιος, καὶ ἡ σελήνη ἐν στάσει, ἕως
ᾐμύνάτο ἔθνος τοὺς ἐχθροὺς αὐτῶν. Οὐχὶ τοῦτο γεγραμμένον ἐπὶ
βιβλίου τοῦ εὐθοῦς; καὶ ἔστη δ᾽ ἥλιος κατὰ μέσον τοῦ οὐρανοῦ,
14 καὶ οὐ προεπορεύετο εἰς δυσμὰς εἰς τέλος ἡμέρας μιᾶς. Καὶ οὐκ
ἐγένετο ἡμέρα τοιαύτη οὐδὲ τὸ πρότερον οὐδὲ τὸ ἔσχατον, ὥστ-
ἐπακοῦσαι Θεὸν φωνῆς ἀνθρώπου, ὅτι Κύριος συνεπολέμησε τῷ
15 Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν Ἰησοῦς καὶ πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ εἰς
16 τὴν παρεμβολὴν εἰς Γάλγαλα. Καὶ ἔφυγον οἱ πέντε βασιλεῖς οὗτοι,
17 καὶ κατεκρύβησαν εἰς τὸ σπήλαιον τὸ ἐν Μακηδά. Καὶ ἀπηγγέλθη
τῷ Ἰησοῦ, λέγοντες· εὕρηνται οἱ πέντε βασιλεῖς κεκρυμμένοι ἐν
18 τῷ σπηλαίῳ τῷ ἐν Μακηδά. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰησοῦς· κυλίσάτε λίθους
μεγάλους ἐπὶ τὸ στόμα τοῦ σπηλαίου, καὶ καταστήσατε ἐπ᾽ αὐ-
19 τοῦ ἄνδρας, τοῦ φυλάσσειν ἐπ᾽ αὐτούς· ὑμεῖς δὲ μὴ ἑστήκατε,
καταδιώκοντες ὀπίσω τῶν ἐχθρῶν ὑμῶν, καὶ καταλάβετε τὴν αὐ-
ραγίαν αὐτῶν, καὶ μὴ ἀφῆτε αὐτοὺς εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὰς πόλεις αὐ-
τῶν· παρέδωκε γὰρ αὐτοὺς Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν εἰς τὰς χεῖρας
20 ὑμῶν. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς κατέπαυσεν Ἰησοῦς καὶ (πάντες) οἱ υἱοὶ
Ἰσραὴλ κόπτοντες αὐτοὺς κοπὴν μεγάλην σφόδρα ἕως εἰς τέλος,
καὶ οἱ διασωζόμενοι διεσώθησαν ἀπ᾽ αὐτῶν, καὶ εἰσῆλθον εἰς τὰς
21 πόλεις τὰς ὀχυράς. Καὶ ἀπεστράφη πᾶς ὁ λαὸς πρὸς Ἰησοῦν εἰς
Μακηδὰ εἰς τὴν παρεμβολὴν ὑγιής, καὶ οὐκ ἔγρυξεν οὐδεὶς τῶν
υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ τῇ γλώσσῃ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰησοῦς· ἀνοίξατε τὸ
σπήλαιον, καὶ ἐξενέγκατε πρός με τοὺς πέντε βασιλεῖς τούτους
23 ἐκ τοῦ σπηλαίου. Καὶ ἐποίησαν οὕτως, καὶ ἐξηγάγοσαν πρὸς αὐ-
τὸν τοὺς πέντε βασιλεῖς τούτους ἐκ τοῦ σπηλαίου, τὸν βασιλέα
Ἱερουσαλήμ, καὶ τὸν βασιλέα Χεβρών, καὶ τὸν βασιλέα Ἰεριμούθ,
24 καὶ τὸν βασιλέα Λαχεῖς, καὶ τὸν βασιλέα Ὁδολλάμ. Καὶ ἐπεὶ
ἐξήγαγον αὐτοὺς πρὸς Ἰησοῦν, καὶ συνεκάλεςεν Ἰησοῦς πάντα
ἄνδρα Ἰσραήλ, καὶ τοὺς ἐναρχομένους τοῦ πολέμου (καὶ) τοὺς
συμπορευομένους αὐτῷ, λέγων αὐτοῖς· προσπορεύεσθε καὶ ἐπίθετε
τοὺς πόδας ὑμῶν ἐπὶ τοὺς τραχήλους αὐτῶν. Καὶ προσελθόντες
25 ἐπέθηκαν τοὺς πόδας αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τοὺς τραχήλους αὐτῶν. Καὶ εἶ-
πε πρὸς αὐτοὺς Ἰησοῦς· μὴ φοβηθῆτε αὐτοὺς, μηδὲ δειλιάσητε·
ἀνδρίζεσθε καὶ ἰσχύετε, ὅτι οὕτω ποιήσει Κύριος πᾶσι τοῖς ἐχ-
26 θροῖς ὑμῶν, οὓς ὑμεῖς καταπολεμεῖτε αὐτούς. Καὶ ἀπέκτεινεν αὐ-
τοὺς Ἰησοῦς μετὰ τοῦτο, καὶ ἐθανάτωσεν αὐτοὺς καὶ ἐκρέμασεν

**Joshua 10**

<sup>13</sup> Ailon. And the sun stood still, and the moon remained in its place, until the nation had avenged itself upon its enemies. Is not this written in the book of the Upright? And the sun stood in the midst of heaven,
<sup>14</sup> and it hasted not to go down to its setting for a whole day. And there was no day like that, neither before nor after it, that God should hearken unto the voice of a man; for the Lord did fight for
<sup>15</sup> Israel. And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp, unto Gilgal.

<sup>16</sup> Now these five kings had fled,
<sup>17</sup> and hidden themselves in the cave that was in Makkedah. And it was told unto Joshua, saying, "The five kings are found, hidden in
<sup>18</sup> the cave that is in Makkedah." And Joshua said, "Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men upon it,
<sup>19</sup> to guard them. But as for you, stand ye not still, but pursue after your enemies, and overtake their rearguard, and suffer them not to enter into their cities; for the Lord your God hath delivered them into your hands."
<sup>20</sup> And it came to pass, when Joshua and (all) the children of Israel had made an end of smiting them with a very great slaughter, until they were consumed, that the survivors among them escaped, and entered into the fortified
<sup>21</sup> cities. Then all the people returned unto Joshua, to the camp at Makkedah, safe; and no man of the children of Israel moved his tongue.
<sup>22</sup> And Joshua said, "Open the mouth of the cave, and bring forth unto me these five kings out of the cave."
<sup>23</sup> And they did so, and brought forth unto him these five kings out of the cave: the king of Jerusalem, and the king of Hebron, and the king of Jarmuth,
<sup>24</sup> and the king of Lachish, and the king of Adullam. And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and for the captains of the war, (even) those who had gone with him, saying unto them, "Draw nigh, and put your feet upon the necks of these kings." And they drew nigh,
<sup>25</sup> and put their feet upon their necks. And Joshua said unto them, "Fear them not, neither be dismayed; be strong and courageous, for thus shall the Lord do to all your enemies
<sup>26</sup> against whom ye make war." And after this, Joshua slew them, and put them to death, and hanged them
