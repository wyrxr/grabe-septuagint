ΚΕΦ. ΛΑʹ. ΛΒʹ. ΔΕΥΤΕΡΟΝΟΜΙΟΝ 369
λαβόντες τὸ βιβλίον τοῦ νόμου τούτου, θήσετε αὐτὸ ἐκ πλαγίων 26
τῆς κιβωτοῦ τῆς διαθήκης Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ὑμῶν, καὶ ἔσται ἐκεῖ
ἐν σοί: εἰς μαρτύριον ὅτι ἐγὼ ἐπίσταμαι τὸν ἐρεθισμόν σου, καὶ τὸν 27
τράχηλόν σου τὸν σκληρόν. Ἔτι γὰρ ἐμοῦ ζῶντος μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν σή-
μερον, παραπικραίνοντες ἧτε τὰ πρὸς τὸν Θεόν· πῶς οὐχὶ καὶ ἔ-
σχατον τοῦ θανάτου μου ; Ἐκκλησιάσατε πρὸς με τοὺς φυλάρχους 28
ὑμῶν, καὶ τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους ὑμῶν (καὶ τοὺς κριτὰς ὑμῶν), καὶ
τοὺς γραμματοεισαγωγεῖς ὑμῶν, ἵνα λαλήσω εἰς τὰ ὦτα αὐτῶν
πάντας τοὺς λόγους τούτους, καὶ διαμαρτύρωμαι αὐτοῖς τόν τε
οὐρανὸν καὶ τὴν γῆν. Οἶδα γὰρ ὅτι ἔσχατον τῆς τελευτῆς μου 29
ἀνομίᾳ ἀνομήσετε, καὶ ἐκκλινεῖτε ἐκ τῆς ὁδοῦ ἧς ἐνετειλάμην
ὑμῖν, καὶ συναντήσεται ὑμῖν τὰ κακὰ ἔσχατον τῶν ἡμερῶν, ὅτι
ποιήσετε τὸ πονηρὸν ἔναντι Κυρίου, παροργίσαι αὐτὸν ἐν τοῖς ἔρ-
γοις τῶν χειρῶν ὑμῶν. Καὶ ἐλάλησε Μωυσῆς εἰς τὰ ὦτα πάσης 30
τῆς ἐκκλησίας Ἰσραὴλ τὰ ῥήματα τῆς ᾠδῆς ταύτης ἕως εἰς τέλος.

ΚΕΦ. ΛΒʹ. XXXII.

Πρόσεχε οὐρανέ, καὶ λαλήσω, καὶ ἀκουέτω γῆ ῥήματα ἐκ 1
στόματός μου. Προσδοκάσθω ὡς ὑετὸς τὸ ἀπόφθεγμά μου, καὶ κα- 2
ταβήτω ὡς δρόσος τὰ ῥήματά μου, ὡσεὶ ἔμβρος ἐπ᾿ ἄγρωστιν,
καὶ ὡσεὶ νιφετὸς ἐπὶ χόρτον. Ὅτι ὄνομα Κυρίου ἐκάλεσα, δότε 3
μεγαλωσύνην τῷ Θεῷ ἡμῶν· Θεὸς ἀληθινὰ τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ, καὶ
πᾶσαι αἱ ὁδοὶ αὐτοῦ, κρίσις. Θεὸς πιστός, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἀδικία· 4
δίκαιος καὶ ὅσιος Κύριος. Ἡμάρτοσαν, οὐκ αὐτῷ τέκνα μωμητά· 5
γενεὰ σκολιὰ καὶ διεστραμμένη. Ταῦτα Κυρίῳ ἀνταποδίδοτε, οὕτω 6
λαὸς μωρὸς καὶ οὐχὶ σοφός; οὐκ αὐτὸς οὗτός σου πατὴρ ἐκτήσατό
σε, καὶ ἐποίησέ σε, καὶ ἔκτισέ σε; Μνήσθητε ἡμέρας αἰῶνος, σύν- 7
ετε ἔτη γενεᾶς γενεῶν· ἐπερώτησον τὸν πατέρα σου, καὶ ἀναγγε-
λεῖ σοι, τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους σου, καὶ ἐροῦσί σοι. Ὅτε διεμέριζεν ὁ 8
Ὕψιστος ἔθνη, ὡς διέσπειρεν υἱοὺς Ἀδάμ, ἔστησεν ὅρια ἐθνῶν κα-
τὰ ἀριθμὸν ἀγγέλων Θεοῦ· καὶ ἐγενήθη μερὶς Κυρίου λαὸς αὐτοῦ 9
Ἰακώβ· σχοίνισμα κληρονομίας αὐτοῦ, Ἰσραήλ. Αὐτάρχησεν αὐτὸν 10
ἐν γῇ ἐρήμῳ, ἐν δίψει καύματος ἐν ἀνύδρῳ· ἐκύκλωσεν αὐτὸν καὶ
ἐπαίδευσεν αὐτόν, καὶ διεφύλαξεν αὐτὸν ὡς κόρην ὀφθαλμοῦ. Ὡς ἀετὸς 11
σκεπάσαι νοσσιὰν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπὶ τοῖς νοσσοῖς αὐτοῦ ἐπεπότησε· διεῖλεν

**Deuteronomy 31**

26 "Take ye this book of the Law, and place it at the side of the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God, and there shall it be within thee:
27 [It shall serve] for a witness that I know well thy provocation, and thy stubborn neck.
28 For while I yet live amongst you this day, ye have ever been prone to bitterness against God; how much more then after my death? Assemble ye unto me all the chiefs of your tribes, and your elders (and your judges), and your recorders, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call both heaven and earth to witness against them.
29 For I know that after my decease ye shall utterly act lawlessly, and shall turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and grievous evils shall befall you in the latter days, because ye shall do that which is evil in the sight of the Lord, provoking Him to wrath by the works of your hands."
30 And Moses spake into the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song, even unto the very end thereof.

**Deuteronomy 32**

1 Give ear, O heavens, and I shall speak; and let the earth hear the words from out of my mouth.
2 Let my doctrine be awaited as the rain, and let my words descend as the dew; as a shower upon the tender herb, and as the snow upon the grass.
3 For I have proclaimed the name of the Lord; give ye glory unto our God. God, His works are truth, and all His ways are judgment.
4 A faithful God, and in Him is no unrighteousness; just and holy is the Lord.
5 They have dealt corruptly; they are not His children, but [are a] blemish [unto Him]; a crooked and perverse generation.
6 Do ye thus repay the Lord, O foolish people and unwise? Is not He Himself thy Father, who hath purchased thee, and made thee, and established thee?
7 Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations; ask thy father, and he shall show thee; thine elders, and they shall tell thee.
8 When the Most High divided unto the nations their inheritance, when He separated the sons of Adam, He set the bounds of the peoples according to the number of the angels of God;
9 And the portion of the Lord became His people Jacob; the measured line of His inheritance, Israel.
10 He sustained him in a desert land, in the parched thirst of a waterless place; He encircled him, and instructed him, and guarded him as the apple of His eye.
11 As an eagle shelters its nest, and hovers over its young, [and] spreads
