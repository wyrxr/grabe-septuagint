λευσέται ἐπὶ τὰ ὅρια τοῦ Ἀρχιαταρώθ· καὶ διελεύσεται ἐπὶ τὴν
θάλασσαν εἰς τὰ ὅρια τοῦ Ἰσραηλτὶ ἕως τῶν ὁρίων Βαιθωρὼν τῆς
κάτω καὶ ἕως Γαζέρ, καὶ ἔσται ἡ διέξοδος αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τὴν θάλασ-
σαν. Καὶ ἐκληρονόμησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰωσήφ, Ἐφραὶμ καὶ Μανασσῆ.
Καὶ ἐγενήθη τὰ ὅρια υἱῶν Ἐφραὶμ καττὰ δήμους αὐτῶν· καὶ ἐγε-
νήθη τὰ ὅρια τῆς κληρονομίας αὐτῶν ἀπ’ ἀνατολῶν Ἀταρὼθ (καὶ)
Ἀδὰρ ἕως Βαιθωρὼν τῆς ἄνω καὶ Γαζαρά· καὶ διελεύσεται τὰ
ὅρια ἐπὶ τὴν θάλασσαν εἰς Μαχθὼθ ἀπὸ βορρᾶ, καὶ περιελεύσε-
ται τὸ ὅριον ἐπ’ ἀνατολὰς εἰς Τηναθ-σηλὼ, καὶ παρελεύσεται αὐ-
τὸ ἀπ’ ἀνατολῶν εἰς Ἰανωχά· καὶ καταβήσεται ἀπὸ Ἰανωχὰ εἰς
Ἀταρὼθ, καὶ Νααραθὰ, καὶ αἱ κῶμαι αὐτῶν· καὶ διελεύσεται εἰς
Ἱεριχὼ, καὶ διεξαλεῖ ἐπὶ τὸν Ἰορδάνην· καὶ ἀπὸ Ταπροῦ
παρελεύσεται ὅρια ἐπὶ θάλασσαν ἐπὶ χειμάρρουν Κανά, καὶ ἔσται
ἡ διέξοδος αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ θάλασσαν. Αὕτη ἡ κληρονομία φυλῆς υἱῶν
Ἐφραὶμ καττὰ δήμους αὐτῶν. Καὶ αἱ πόλεις αἱ ἀφορισθεῖσαι τοῖς
υἱοῖς Ἐφραὶμ ἀναμέσον τῆς κληρονομίας υἱῶν Μανασσῆ, πᾶσαι·
αἱ πόλεις καὶ αἱ κῶμαι αὐτῶν. Καὶ οὐκ ἀπώλεσεν Ἐφραὶμ τὸν
Χαναναῖον τὸν κατοικοῦντα ἐν Γαζέρ· καὶ κατῴκει ὁ Χαναναῖος
ἐν τῷ Ἐφραὶμ ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης, ἕως ἀνέβη Φαραὼ βα-
σιλεὺς Αἰγύπτου, καὶ ἔλαβε τὴν πόλιν, καὶ ἐνέπρησεν αὐτὴν ἐν
πυρί· καὶ τοὺς Χαναναίους, καὶ τοὺς Φερεζαίους, καὶ τοὺς κα-
τοικοῦντας ἐν Γαζὲρ ἐξεκέντησε, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὴν Φαραὼ ἐν
φερνῇ τῇ θυγατρὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐγένοντο ὑπόφροι δοῦλοι.

ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο τὰ ὅρια φυλῆς (υἱῶν) Μανασσῆ, ὅτι οὗτος πρω-

τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἐσριὴλ, καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς Σεχέμ, καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς Σεμιραὲ,
καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς Ὀρέρ· οὗτοι υἱοὶ Μανασσῆ υἱοῦ Ἰωσὴφ οἱ ἄρσενες
καττὰ δήμους αὐτῶν. Καὶ τῷ Σαλφαὰδ υἱῷ Ὀρέρ υἱοῦ Γαλαάδ, υἱοῦ
Μαχεῖρ, υἱοῦ Μανασσῆ, οὐκ ἦσαν αὐτῷ υἱοί, ἀλλ’ ἡ θυγατέρες.

**Joshua 16**

<sup>3</sup> And it shall pass over unto the borders of Archi-ataroth; and it shall pass through unto the sea, even unto the borders of the Israelite, and unto the borders of Beth-horon the Lower and unto Gezer; and their going forth shall be toward the sea.
<sup>4</sup> And the children of Joseph did inherit, [even] Ephraim and Manasseh.

<sup>5</sup> And the borders of the children of Ephraim were according to their clans; and the borders of their inheritance were from the east, Ataroth (and) Adar, even unto Beth-horon the Upper and Gezer.
<sup>6</sup> And the borders shall pass over unto the sea, unto Makhtoth from the north; and the border shall turn about eastward unto Taanath-shiloh, and it shall pass it from the east unto Janochah.
<sup>7</sup> And it shall go down from Janochah to Ataroth and Naarathah, and their villages; and it shall pass through unto Jericho, and shall go forth unto the Jordan.
<sup>8</sup> And from Tappuah the borders shall pass over unto the sea, unto the Wadi Kanah; and its going forth shall be toward the sea.

<sup>9</sup> This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim according to their clans. And the cities which were set apart for the children of Ephraim, amidst the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, were all of them:
<sup>10</sup> the cities and their villages. And Ephraim did not dispossess the Canaanite that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanite did dwell among Ephraim until this day, until Pharaoh, king of Egypt, came up, and took the city, and burned it with fire; and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and those that dwelt in Gezer, he did utterly destroy, and Pharaoh gave it as a dowry unto his daughter, and they became tributary servants.

**Joshua 17**

<sup>1</sup> And the boundaries of the tribe of (the children of) Manasseh were established, for he was the firstborn of Joseph, even to Machir, the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, (for he was a man of war) in Gilead and in Bashan.
<sup>2</sup> And it was given to the rest of the children of Manasseh according to their clans: to the children of Abiezer, and to the children of Helek, and to the children of Esriel, and to the children of Shechem, and to the children of Shemirah, and to the children of Hepher. These are the male children of Manasseh, the son of Joseph, according to their clans.
<sup>3</sup> And unto Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, there were no sons unto him, but the daughters. These are the names of the daughters of Zelophehad: Mahlah, and
