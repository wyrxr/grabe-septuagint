ΚΕΦ. Θʹ.                                    ΔΕΥΤΕΡΟΝΟΜΙΟΝ                                  327
λατο Κύριος ὑμῖν, καὶ ἐπιλαβόμενος τῶν δύο πλακῶν, ἐξέψυξα αὐ- 17
τὰς ἀπὸ τῶν δύο χειρῶν μου, καὶ συνέτριψα αὐτὰς ἐναντίον ὑμῶν·
Καὶ ἐδεήθην ἔναντι Κυρίου δεύτερον, καθάπερ καὶ τὸ πρότερον, 18
τεσσαράκοντα ἡμέρας καὶ τεσσαράκοντα νύκτας, (ἄρτον οὐκ ἔφα-
γον καὶ ὕδωρ οὐκ ἔπιον) περὶ πασῶν τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν ὑμῶν ὧν
ἡμάρτετε, ποιῆσαι τὸ πονηρὸν ἔναντι Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ὑμῶν τοῦ
παροξύναι αὐτόν· καὶ ἔκφοβός εἰμι διὰ τὴν ὀργὴν καὶ τὸν θυμόν, 19
ὅτι παρωξύνθη Κύριος ἐφ᾿ ὑμῖν, τοῦ ἐξολοθρεῦσαι ὑμᾶς· καὶ εἰ-
σήκουσε Κύριος ἐμοῦ καὶ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ. Καὶ ἐπὶ ᾿Ααρὼν 20
ἐθυμώθη Κύριος σφόδρα, τοῦ ἐξολοθρεῦσαι αὐτόν· καὶ ηὐξάμην
καὶ περὶ ᾿Ααρὼν ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ. Καὶ τὴν ἁμαρτίαν ὑμῶν 21
ἣν ἐποιήσατε, τὸν μόσχον, ἔλαβον αὐτόν, καὶ κατέκαυσα αὐτὸν
ἐν πυρί, καὶ συνέτριψα αὐτόν, καὶ κατήλασα σφόδρα, ἕως οὗ ἐγέ-
νετο λεπτόν, καὶ ἐγενήθη ὡσεὶ χουςορτός, καὶ ἐῤῥιψα τὸν χουορ-
τὸν αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸν χειμάῤῥουν τὸν καταβαίνοντα ἀπὸ τοῦ ὄρους.
Καὶ ἐν τῷ ἐμπυρισμῷ, καὶ ἐν τῷ πειρασμῷ, καὶ ἐν τοῖς μνή- 22
μασι τῆς ἐπιθυμίας παροξύνοντες ἦτε Κύριον τὸν Θεὸν ὑμῶν.
Καὶ ὅτε ἀπέστειλεν ὑμᾶς Κύριος ἐκ Κάδης Βαρνὴ, λέγων· ἀνά- 23
βητε καὶ κληρονομήσατε τὴν γῆν, ἣν (ἐγὼ) δίδωμι ὑμῖν, καὶ ἠπει-
θήσατε τῷ ῥήματι Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ὑμῶν, καὶ οὐκ ἐπιστεύσατε
αὐτῷ, καὶ οὐκ εἰσηκούσατε τῆς φωνῆς αὐτοῦ· ἀπειθοῦντες ἦτε τὰ 24
πρὸς Κύριον ἀφ᾿ ἧς ἡμέρας ἐγνώσθη ὑμῖν. Καὶ ἐδεήθην ἔναντι 25
Κυρίου τεσσαράκοντα ἡμέρας καὶ τεσσαράκοντα νύκτας, ὅσας ἐδε-
ήθην· (εἶπε γὰρ Κύριος ἐξολοθρεῦσαι ὑμᾶς)· καὶ ηὐξάμην πρὸς 26
τὸν Θεόν, καὶ εἶπα· Κύριε, Κύριε βασιλεῦ τῶν θεῶν, μὴ ἐξολο-
θρεύσῃς τὸν λαόν σου καὶ τὴν κληρονομίαν σου, ἣν ἐλυτρώσω ἐν
τῇ ἰσχύϊ σου τῇ μεγάλῃ, οὓς ἐξήγαγες ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου ἐν τῇ
ἰσχύϊ σου τῇ μεγάλῃ, καὶ ἐν χειρί σου τῇ κραταιᾷ, καὶ ἐν τῷ
βραχίονι σου τῷ μεγάλῳ. Μνήσθητι ᾿Αβραὰμ καὶ ᾿Ισαὰκ καὶ ᾿Ια- 27
κὼβ τῶν θεραπόντων σου, (οἷς ὤμοσας κατὰ σεαυτοῦ) μὴ ἐπιβλέ-
ψῃς ἐπὶ τὴν σκληρότητα τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ ἁμαρτή-
ματα αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ ἀσεβήματα αὐτῶν· μήποτε εἴπωσιν οἱ κα- 28
τοικοῦντες τὴν γῆν, ὅθεν ἐξήγαγες ἡμᾶς ἐκεῖθεν, λέγοντες· παρὰ
τὸ μὴ δύνασθαι Κύριον εἰσαγαγεῖν αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν γῆν ἣν εἶπεν
αὐτοῖς, καὶ παρὰ τὸ μισῆσαι Κύριον αὐτοὺς, ἐξήγαγεν αὐτοὺς,
ἀποκτεῖναι αὐτοὺς, ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ. Καὶ οὗτοι λαός σου καὶ κληρός 29

**Deuteronomy 9**

**17** The Lord was hidden from you; and taking hold of the two tablets, I cast them from my two hands and brake them before your eyes.
**18** And I supplicated before the Lord a second time, even as the former time, forty days and forty nights, (I ate no bread nor drank any water,) concerning all your sins which ye had sinned, to commit that which is evil before the Lord your God, to provoke Him [to wrath].
**19** And I was in great fear because of the wrath and the fierce anger, for the Lord was greatly provoked against you, to destroy you utterly. And the Lord heard me even in that time.
**20** And against Aaron was the Lord exceeding wroth, to destroy him utterly; and I prayed also for Aaron in that same time.
**21** And your sin which ye had committed, the calf, I took it, and burned it with fire, and crushed it, and ground it very small, until it became fine; and it became as bread-dust; and I cast the bread-dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mountain.
**22** And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah (the graves of lust), ye were provoking the Lord your God [to wrath].
**23** And when the Lord sent you from Kadesh-Barnea, saying, “Go up and possess the land which I give unto you,” ye rebelled against the word of the Lord your God, and ye believed Him not, nor hearkened unto His voice.
**24** Ye were rebellious against the Lord from the day that [He] was known to you.
**25** And I supplicated before the Lord forty days and forty nights, as I had supplicated; (for the Lord had said that He would destroy you utterly.)
**26** And I prayed unto God, and said, “O Lord, Lord, King of the gods, destroy not Thy people and Thine inheritance, whom Thou hast redeemed with Thy great strength, whom Thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with Thy great strength, and with Thy mighty hand, and with Thy great arm.
**27** Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Thy servants, (to whom Thou didst swear by Thyself,) look not upon the hardness of this people, nor upon their sins, nor upon their iniquities;
**28** lest peradventure the inhabitants of the land say, from whence Thou broughtest us out thence, saying, ‘Because the Lord was not able to bring them into the land which He promised them, and because the Lord hated them, He brought them forth to slay them in the wilderness.’
**29** Yet they are Thy people and Thine inheritance, whom Thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt with Thy great strength and with Thy high arm.”
