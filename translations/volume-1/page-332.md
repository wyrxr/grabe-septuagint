    ΚΕΦ. Δ´. ΔΕΥΤΕΡΟΝΟΜΙΟΝ 317
    Θεὸς οἰκτίρμων Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου, οὐκ ἐγκαταλείψει σε, οὐδὲ μὴ
    ἐκτρίψῃ σε, οὐκ ἐπιλήσεται τὴν διαθήκην τῶν πατέρων σου, ἣν ὤ-
    μοσεν αὐτοῖς. Ἐπερωτήσατε ἡμέρας προτέρας, τὰς γενομένας προ- 32
    τέρας σου, ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέρας ἧς ἔκτισεν ὁ Θεὸς τὸν ἄνθρωπον ἐπὶ
    τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ ἄκρα τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, ἕως ἄκρου τοῦ οὐρανοῦ,
    εἰ γέγονε κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα τὸ μέγα τοῦτο, εἰ ἤκουσταί τοιοῦτο· εἰ ἀκή- 33
    κοεν ἔθνος φωνὴν Θεοῦ ζῶντος λαλεῦντος ἐκ μέσου τοῦ πυρός,
    ὃν τρόπον ἀκήκοας σὺ καὶ ἔζησας· ἢ εἰ ἐπείρασεν ὁ Θεὸς εἰσελ- 34
    θεῖν λαβεῖν ἑαυτῷ ἔθνος ἐκ μέσου ἔθνους ἐν πειρασμῷ, καὶ ἐν ση-
    μείοις, καὶ ἐν τέρασι, καὶ ἐν πολέμῳ, καὶ ἐν χειρὶ κραταιᾷ, καὶ
    ἐν βραχίονι ὑψηλῷ, καὶ ἐν δράμασι μεγάλοις, κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἐ-
    ποίησε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ ἐνώπιόν σου βλέποντος·
    ὥστε εἰδέναι σε, ὅτι Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου αὐτὸς Θεός ἐστι, καὶ οὐκ 35
    ἔστιν ἄλλος πλὴν αὐτοῦ. Ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ἀκουστήν σοι ἐποίησε 36
    τὴν φωνὴν αὐτοῦ, παιδεῦσαί σε, καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς ἔδειξέ σοι τὸ πῦρ
    αὐτοῦ τὸ μέγα, καὶ τὰ ῥήματα αὐτοῦ ἤκουσας ἐκ μέσου τοῦ πυ-
    ρὸς διὰ τὸ ἀγαπῆσαι αὐτὸν τοὺς πατέρας σου, καὶ ἐξελέξατο 37
    τὸ σπέρμα αὐτῶν μετ᾿ αὐτοὺς ὑμᾶς, καὶ ἐξήγαγέ σε αὐτὸς ἐν τῇ
    ἰσχύϊ αὐτοῦ τῇ μεγάλῃ ἐξ Αἰγύπτου, ἐξολοθρεῦσαι ἔθνη μεγάλα 38
    καὶ ἰσχυρότερά σου πρὸ προσώπου σου, εἰσαγαγεῖν σε, δοῦναί σοι τὴν
    γῆν αὐτῶν κληρονομεῖν, καθὼς ἔχεις σήμερον. Καὶ γνώσῃ σήμε- 39
    ρον, καὶ ἐπιστραφήσῃ τῇ διανοίᾳ, ὅτι Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου οὗτος
    Θεὸς ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ ἄνω, καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς κάτω, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν
    ἔτι πλὴν αὐτοῦ· καὶ φυλάξῃ τὰ δικαιώματα αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰς ἐντο- 40
    λὰς αὐτοῦ, ὅσας ἐγὼ ἐντέλλομαί σοι σήμερον, ἵνα εὖ σοι γένηται
    καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς σου μετὰ σέ, ὅπως μακροχρόνιοι γένησθε ἐπὶ τῆς
    γῆς, ἧς Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου δίδωσί σοι πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας. Τότε 41
    ἀφώρισε Μωυσῆς τρεῖς πόλεις πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν 42
    ἡλίου φεύγειν ἐκεῖ τὸν φονευτήν, ὃς ἂν φονεύσῃ τὸν πλησίον οὐκ
    εἰδώς, καὶ οὗτος οὐ μισῶν αὐτὸν πρὸ τῆς ἐχθὲς καὶ τρίτης, καὶ
    καταφεύξεται εἰς μίαν τῶν πόλεων τούτων, καὶ ζήσεται· τὴν Βο- 43
    σόρ ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ ἐν τῇ γῇ τῇ πεδινῇ τῷ Ῥουβήν, καὶ τὴν Ῥαμ-
    μὼθ ἐν Γαλαὰδ τῷ Γαδδί, καὶ τὴν Γαυλὼν ἐν Βασὰν τῷ Μα-

    ραήλ· ταῦτα τὰ μαρτύρια καὶ τὰ δικαιώματα καὶ τὰ κρίματα, 45
    ὅσα ἐλάλησε Μωυσῆς τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, ἐξελθόν-

    **Deuteronomy 4**
    $^{31}$ For the LORD thy God is a God of compassion; He will not abandon thee, nor will He utterly destroy thee, neither will He forget the covenant of thy fathers, which He swore unto them.
    $^{32}$ For enquire now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and to the ends of the heaven, even unto the end of the heaven: if there hath been such a great thing as this, or if such a thing hath been heard.
    $^{33}$ Hath any nation heard the voice of a living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard and lived?
    $^{34}$ Or hath God assayed to go and take to Himself a nation from the midst of a nation, by trials, and by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by an uplifted arm, and by great deeds, according to all that the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before thine own eyes?
    $^{35}$ That thou mightest know that the LORD thy God, He is God, and there is none other beside Him.
    $^{36}$ From heaven He caused thee to hear His voice, to instruct thee, and upon earth He showed thee His great fire, and His words thou didst hear out of the midst of the fire.
    $^{37}$ Because He loved thy fathers, and chose their seed after them, even you; and He Himself brought thee forth out of Egypt with His great strength,
    $^{38}$ to exterminate nations great and stronger than thee before thy face, to bring thee in, to give thee their land to inherit, as thou hast it this day.
    $^{39}$ And thou shalt know this day, and shalt turn it in thy heart, that the LORD thy God, He is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath, and there is none else beside Him.
    $^{40}$ And thou shalt keep His statutes and His commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may be well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth, which the Lord thy God giveth thee throughout all days.

    $^{41}$ Then Moses set apart three cities beyond the Jordan, toward the rising of the sun,
    $^{42}$ for the manslayer to flee thither, whosoever should slay his neighbour unwittingly, and he not hating him before yesterday and the third [day]; and he shall flee into one of these cities, and live.
    $^{43}$ [These were] Bosor in the wilderness, in the plain country, for Reuben; and Ramoth in Gilead, for Gad; and Gaulon in Bashan, for Manasseh.

    $^{44}$ This is the Law which Moses set before the children of Israel.
    $^{45}$ These are the testimonies and the statutes and the judgments, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel in the wilderness, when they had departed—
