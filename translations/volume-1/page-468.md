**5** υἱόν· καὶ οὐκ ἀναβήσεται σίδηρος ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ, ὅτι (ἡγιασμένον) Ναζειραῖον ἔσται τῷ Θεῷ τὸ παιδάριον ἐκ τῆς γαστρὸς· καὶ αὐτὸς ἄρξεται σώζειν τὸν Ἰσραὴλ ἐκ χειρὸς ἀλλοφύλων.
**6** Καὶ ἦλθεν ἡ γυνή, καὶ εἶπε τῷ ἀνδρὶ αὐτῆς λέγουσα· ἔτι ἄνθρωπος τοῦ Θεοῦ ἦλθε πρός με, καὶ ἡ ὅρασις αὐτοῦ ὡς ὅρασις ἀγγέλου τοῦ Θεοῦ, ἐπιφανὴς σφόδρα· καὶ ἠρώτων αὐτὸν πόθεν ἐστί, καὶ τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἀπήγγειλέ μοι.
**7** Καὶ εἶπέ μοι· Ἰδοὺ σὺ ἐν γαστρὶ ἕξεις, καὶ τέξῃ υἱόν· καὶ νῦν μὴ πίῃς οἶνον καὶ σίκερα, καὶ μὴ φάγῃς πᾶσαν ἀκαθαρσίαν, ὅτι Ναζειραῖον Θεοῦ ἐστι τὸ παιδάριον ἀπὸ τῆς γαστρὸς ἕως ἡμέρας θανάτου αὐτοῦ.
**8** Καὶ ἐδεήθη Μανωὲ τοῦ Κυρίου, καὶ εἶπεν· ἐν ἐμοί Κύριε, ἄνθρωπος τοῦ Θεοῦ ὃν ἀπέστειλας πρὸς ἡμᾶς, ἐλθέτω δὴ ἔτι πρὸς ἡμᾶς, καὶ φωτισάτω ἡμᾶς τί ποιήσωμεν τῷ παιδαρίῳ τῷ τικτομένῳ.
**9** Καὶ ἐπήκουσεν ὁ Θεὸς τῆς φωνῆς Μανωέ· καὶ παρεγένετο ὁ ἄγγελος τοῦ Θεοῦ ἔτι πρὸς τὴν γυναῖκα, αὐτῆς καθημένης ἐν τῷ ἀγρῷ, καὶ Μανωὲ ὁ ἀνὴρ αὐτῆς οὐκ ἦν μετ᾿ αὐτῆς.
**10** Καὶ ἐτάχυνεν ἡ γυνή, καὶ ἐξέδραμε, καὶ ἀπήγγειλε τῷ ἀνδρὶ αὐτῆς, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτόν· Ἰδοὺ ὤπται μοι ὁ ἀνήρ, ὁ ἐλθὼν πρός με τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ.
**11** Καὶ ἀνέστη Μανωέ, καὶ ἐπορεύθη ὀπίσω τῆς γυναικὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἦλθε πρὸς τὸν ἄνδρα, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· εἰ σὺ εἶ ὁ ἀνήρ, ὁ λαλήσας πρὸς τὴν γυναῖκα; Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ ἄγγελος· ἐγώ.
**12** Καὶ εἶπε Μανωέ· νῦν δὲ ἐλθόντος τοῦ ῥήματός σου, τί ἔσται τὸ κρίμα τοῦ παιδίου καὶ τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ;
**13** Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ ἄγγελος Κυρίου πρὸς Μανωέ· ἀπὸ πάντων ὧν εἶπα πρὸς τὴν γυναῖκα, φυλαξάσθω·
**14** ἀπὸ πάντων ὅσα ἐκπορεύεται ἐξ ἀμπέλου οἴνου, οὐ φάγεται, καὶ οἶνον καὶ σίκερα μὴ πιέτω, καὶ πᾶν ἀκάθαρτον μὴ φαγέτω· πάντα ὅσα ἐνετειλάμην αὐτῇ, φυλαξάσθω.
**15** Καὶ εἶπε Μανωὲ πρὸς τὸν ἄγγελον Κυρίου· βιασώμεθα δὴ σε, καὶ ποιήσωμεν ἐναντίον σου ἔριφον αἰγῶν.
**16** Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ ἄγγελος Κυρίου πρὸς Μανωέ· ἐὰν βιάσῃ με, οὐ φάγομαι τῶν ἄρτων σου· καὶ ἐὰν ποιήσῃς ὁλοκαύτωμα, Κυρίῳ ἀνοίσεις αὐτό· ὅτι οὐκ ἔγνω Μανωὲ ὅτι ἄγγελος Κυρίου ἐστί.
**17** Καὶ εἶπε Μανωὲ πρὸς τὸν ἄγγελον Κυρίου· τί ὄνομά σοι, ἵνα ὅταν ἔλθῃ τὸ ῥῆμά σου, δοξάσωμέν σε;
**18** Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ ἄγγελος Κυρίου· ἵνατί τοῦτο ἐρωτᾷς τὸ ὄνομά μου; καὶ αὐτὸ ἐστι θαυμαστόν.
**19** Καὶ ἔλαβε Μανωὲ τὸν ἔριφον τῶν αἰγῶν καὶ τὴν θυσίαν, καὶ ἀνήνεγκεν ἐπὶ τὴν πέτραν τῷ Κυρίῳ, τῷ θαυμαστὰ ποιοῦντι (Κυρίῳ)· καὶ Μανωὲ καὶ ἡ

### Judges Chapter 13

**5.** ... a son. And no razor shall come upon his head; for the child shall be a Nazirite (a consecrated one) unto God from the womb; and he shall begin to save Israel from the hand of the Philistines."

**6.** Then the woman came and spoke unto her husband, saying, "A man of God came yet again unto me, and his countenance was as the countenance of an angel of God, exceedingly glorious. And I asked him whence he was, but his name he did not declare unto me.

**7.** And he said unto me, 'Behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean thing, for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb until the day of his death.'"

**8.** And Manoah entreated the Lord, and said, "O my Lord, I pray thee, let the man of God whom Thou didst send unto us, come again unto us, and enlighten us as to what we shall do for the child that shall be born."

**9.** And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came yet again unto the woman, as she sat in the field, but Manoah her husband was not with her.

**10.** And the woman made haste, and ran, and told her husband, and said unto him, "Behold, the man has appeared unto me, the one who came unto me that other day!"

**11.** And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him, "Art thou the man that didst speak unto the woman?" And the angel said, "I am."

**12.** And Manoah said, "Now, when thy words shall come to pass, what shall be the rule for the child, and what his works?"

**13.** And the angel of the Lord said unto Manoah, "From all things whereof I spoke unto the woman, let her beware:

**14.** Of whatsoever comes from the vine of wine, she shall not eat; neither shall she drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing. All that I commanded her, let her observe."

**15.** And Manoah said unto the angel of the Lord, "I pray thee, let us detain thee, that we may make ready before thee a kid of the goats."

**16.** And the angel of the Lord said unto Manoah, "If thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread; and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou shalt offer it unto the Lord." For Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the Lord.

**17.** And Manoah said unto the angel of the Lord, "What is thy name, that when thy words come to pass, we may do thee honor?"

**18.** And the angel of the Lord said unto him, "Why dost thou ask thus after my name, seeing it is wonderful?"

**19.** And Manoah took a kid of the goats with a meat offering, and offered it upon a rock unto the Lord, unto Him who does wondrous things, [even] the Lord. And Manoah and his wife
