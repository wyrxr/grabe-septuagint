ΚΕΦ. ΙΗʹ. ΙΗΣΟΥΣ ΝΑΥΗ 409
σεν Ἰησοῦς ἐκεῖ τὴν γῆν υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ κατὰ μερισμοὺς αὐτῶν.
Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ὁ κλῆρος φυλῆς υἱῶν Βενιαμὶν πρῶτος κατὰ δήμους 11
αὐτῶν· καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ὅρια τοῦ κλήρου αὐτῶν ἀναμέσον υἱῶν Ἰού-
δα καὶ ἀναμέσον υἱῶν Ἰωσήφ. Καὶ ἐγενήθη αὐτῶν τὰ ὅρια ἀπὸ 12
βορρᾶ· ἀπὸ τοῦ Ἰορδάνου προσαναβαθήσεται τὰ ὅρια κατὰ νώτου Ἰ-
εριχὼ ἀπὸ βορρᾶ, καὶ ἀναβήσεται ἐπὶ τὸ ὄρος κατὰ θάλασσαν,
καὶ ἔσται αὐτοῦ ἡ διέξοδος ἡ Μαδαρίτις Βαιθών. Καὶ διελευ- 13
σεται ἐκεῖθεν τὰ ὅρια Λουζά ἐπὶ νώτου Λουζά ἀπὸ λίβος (αὕτη
ἐστὶ Βαιθήλ)· καὶ καταβήσεται τὰ ὅρια ἀπὸ Ἀταρὼθ Ἀδὰρ ἐπὶ
τὴν ὀρεινήν, ἥ ἐστι πρὸς λίβα Βαιθωρὼν ἡ κάτω· καὶ διελεύσεται 14
τὰ ὅρια, καὶ περιελεύσεται ἐπὶ τὸ μέρος τὸ βλέπον εἰς θάλασσαν
ἀπὸ λίβος ἀπὸ τοῦ ὄρους ἐπὶ πρόσωπον Βαιθωρὼν λίβα, καὶ ἔσται
αὐτοῦ ἡ διέξοδος εἰς Καριαθ-Βαάλ· αὕτη ἐστὶ Καριαθ-Ἰαρίμ,
πόλις υἱῶν Ἰούδα. Τοῦτο ἐστὶ τὸ μέρος τὸ πρὸς θάλασσαν. Καὶ 15
μέρος τὸ πρὸς λίβα ἀπὸ μέρους Καριαθ-Βαάλ· καὶ διελεύσεται τὰ
ὅρια εἰς Γαΐν, καὶ ἐξελεύσεται ἐπὶ πηγὴν ὕδατος Ναφὼθ καὶ κα- 16
ταβήσεται τὰ ὅρια ἐπὶ μέρους τοῦ ὄρους, ὅ ἐστι κατὰ πρόσωπον
νάπης υἱοῦ Ἐννόμ, ὅ ἐστιν ἐκ μέρους Ἐμὲκ Ῥαφαεὶμ ἀπὸ βορρᾶ,
καὶ καταβήσεται ἐπὶ Γαι-Ἐννόμ ἐπὶ νώτου Ἰεβοὺς ἀπὸ λίβος,
καὶ καταβήσεται ἐπὶ πηγὴν Ῥωγήλ· καὶ διεξβαλεῖ ἀπὸ βορρᾶ, 17
καὶ διελεύσεται ἐπὶ πηγὴν Σαμές, καὶ παρελεύσεται ἐπὶ Γαλιθώ,
ἥ ἐστιν ἀπέναντι πρὸς ἀνάβασιν Ἐδωμίμ, καὶ καταβήσεται ἐπὶ
λίθον Βαιὼν υἱοῦ Ῥουβήν· καὶ διελεύσεται κατὰ νώτου Βαιθαρά- 18
βα ἀπὸ βορρᾶ, καὶ καταβήσεται ἐπὶ Ἀραβά, καὶ παρελεύσεται 19
(ἐπὶ) τὰ ὅρια ἐπὶ νώτου Βαιθαγλὰ ἀπὸ βορρᾶ, καὶ ἔσται (αὐ-
τοῦ) ἡ διέξοδος τῶν ὁρίων ἐπὶ λωρίαν τῆς θαλάσσης τῶν ἁλῶν
ἀπὸ βορρᾶ εἰς μέρος τοῦ Ἰορδάνου ἀπὸ λίβος. Ταῦτα τὰ ὅρια ἀπὸ
λίβος. Καὶ ὁ Ἰορδάνης ὁριεῖ αὐτὸ ἀπὸ μέρους ἀνατολῶν. Αὕτη ἡ 20
κληρονομία υἱῶν Βενιαμίν, τὰ ὅρια αὐτῆς κύκλῳ κατὰ δήμους
αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐγενήθησαν αἱ πόλεις τῶν υἱῶν Βενιαμὶν κατὰ δή- 21
μους αὐτῶν Ἱεριχώ, καὶ Βαιθαγλά, καὶ Ἀμεκκασεὶς, καὶ Βαιθαραβά, 22
καὶ Σεμοΐμ, καὶ Βηθήλ, καὶ Αὐείμ, καὶ Ἀφφρά, καὶ Ἀφφὰ, (καὶ 23
Αἰακείμ) καὶ Καφφεραμμίν, καὶ Ἀφνεί, καὶ Γαβαά· πόλεις δώδεκα, 24
καὶ αἱ κῶμαι αὐτῶν. 25 Γαβαών, καὶ Ῥαμά, καὶ Βηρώθ, καὶ Μα- 26
σφά, καὶ Χεφειρά, καὶ Ἀμωσά, καὶ Ῥεκέμ, καὶ Ἰερσαήλ, 27
καὶ Θαραλά, καὶ Σηλαλήφ, καὶ Ἰεβοὺς, (αὕτη ἐστὶν Ἱερουσαλήμ)· 28
καὶ Γαβαὼλ, καὶ πόλις Ἱαρίμ· πόλεις δεκατρεῖς, καὶ αἱ κῶμαι
αὐτῶν. Αὕτη ἡ κληρονομία υἱῶν Βενιαμὶν κατὰ δήμους αὐτῶν.

**Joshua 18**

<sup>10</sup> ...did Joshua divide there the land unto the children of Israel according to their divisions.
<sup>11</sup> And the lot for the tribe of the children of Benjamin came forth first, according to their families; and the boundary of their inheritance came forth between the children of Judah
<sup>12</sup> and between the children of Joseph. And their boundary was from the north; from the Jordan shall the boundary ascend along the back of Jericho from the north, and it shall ascend unto the mountain by the sea,
<sup>13</sup> and its outlet shall be the desert-place of Beth-aven. And from thence shall the boundary pass by Luz, along the back of Luz from the south (the same is Bethel); and the boundary shall descend from Ataroth-Addar unto the mountainous region, which is southward of Lower Beth-horon;
<sup>14</sup> and the boundary shall pass, and shall go around unto the side that looketh toward the sea from the south, from the mountain over against Beth-horon southward; and its outlet shall be unto Kiriath-Baal (the same is Kiriath-Jearim), a city of the children of Judah. This is the part toward the sea.
<sup>15</sup> And the part toward the south is from the region of Kiriath-Baal; and the boundary shall pass unto Gain,
<sup>16</sup> and it shall go forth unto the spring of the waters of Nephthoah, and the boundary shall descend unto the side of the mountain which is over against the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is from the region of the Valley of Rephaim from the north, and it shall descend unto Ge-Hinnom, along the back of the Jebusite from the south,
<sup>17</sup> and it shall descend unto the spring of Rogel; and it shall cast forth [its line] from the north, and it shall pass unto the spring of Shemesh, and it shall go on unto Geliloth, which is over against the ascent of Adummim, and it shall descend unto the stone of Bahin, [the stone] of the son of Reuben;
<sup>18</sup> and it shall pass along the back of Beth-arabah from the north,
<sup>19</sup> and it shall descend unto the Arabah, and it shall pass (unto) the boundary along the back of Beth-hoglah from the north; and (its) outlet of the boundaries shall be unto the strip of the Salt Sea from the north, unto the region of the Jordan from the south. These are the boundaries from the south.
<sup>20</sup> And the Jordan shall mark its boundary from the eastern side. This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, its boundaries round about according to their families.
<sup>21</sup> And the cities of the children of Benjamin, according to their families, were Jericho, and Beth-hoglah, and Emek-Keziz, and Beth-arabah,
<sup>22</sup> and Zemaraim, and Bethel, and Avvim, and Parah, and Ophrah,
<sup>23</sup> (and Aiakeim) and Kephar-Ammoni, and Aphni, and Gabaa: twelve cities,
<sup>24</sup> with their villages.
<sup>25</sup> Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth, and Mizpah,
<sup>26</sup> and Kephirah, and Ammozah, and Rekem, and Irpeel,
<sup>27</sup> and Taralah, and Zelah, and Jebus (the same is Jerusalem):
<sup>28</sup> and Gabaol, and the city of Jearim: thirteen cities with their villages. This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families.
