ἔδωκεν αὐτὸν εἰς τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ, δώσω σοι τόπον οὗ φεύξε-
ται ἐκεῖ ὁ φονεύσας. Ἐὰν δέ τις ἐπιθῆται τῷ πλησίον αὐτοῦ, 14
ἀποκτεῖναι αὐτὸν δόλῳ, καὶ καταφύγῃ, ἀπὸ τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου μου
λήψῃ αὐτὸν θανατῶσαι. Ὅς τύπτει πατέρα αὐτοῦ ἢ μητέρα αὐ- 15
τοῦ, θανάτῳ θανατούσθω. Ὁ κακολογῶν πατέρα αὐτοῦ ἢ μητέρα 16
αὐτοῦ, θανάτῳ τελευτάτω. Ὅς ἂν κλέψῃ τις τινὰ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσ- 17
ραήλ, καὶ καταδυναστεύσας αὐτὸν ἀποδῶται, καὶ εὑρεθῇ ἐν αὐτῷ,
θανάτῳ θανατούσθω. Ἐὰν δὲ λοιδορῶνται δύο ἄνδρες, καὶ πατάξῃ 18
τις τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ λίθῳ ἢ πυγμῇ, καὶ μὴ ἀποθάνῃ, κατα-
κλιθῇ δὲ ἐπὶ τὴν κοίτην, ἐὰν (δὲ) ἐξαναστὰς ὁ ἄνθρωπος περι- 19
πατήσῃ ἔξω ἐπὶ ῥάβδου αὐτοῦ, ἀθῶος ἔσται ὁ πατάξας· πλὴν τῆς
ἀργείας αὐτοῦ ἀποτίσει, καὶ τὰ ἰατρεῖα. Ἐὰν δέ τις πατάξῃ τὸν 20
παῖδα αὐτοῦ ἢ τὴν παιδίσκην αὐτοῦ ἐν ῥάβδῳ, καὶ ἀποθάνῃ ὑπὸ
τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ, δίκῃ ἐκδικηθήσεται· ἐὰν δὲ διαβιώσῃ ἡμέραν 21
μίαν ἢ δύο, οὐκ ἐκδικηθήσεται· τὸ γὰρ ἀργύριον αὐτοῦ ἐστιν. Ἐὰν 22
δὲ μάχωνται δύο ἄνδρες, καὶ πατάξωσι γυναῖκα ἐν γαστρὶ ἔχου-
σαν, καὶ ἐξέλθῃ τὸ παιδίον αὐτῆς μὴ ἐξεικονισμένον, ἐπιζήμιον
ζημιωθήσεται· καθότι ἐὰν ἐπιβάλῃ ὁ ἀνὴρ τῆς γυναικός, καὶ δώ-
σει μετὰ ἀξιώματος· ἐὰν δὲ ἐξεικονισμένον ᾖ, δώσει ψυχὴν ἀντὶ 23
ψυχῆς, ὀφθαλμὸν ἀντὶ ὀφθαλμοῦ, ὀδόντα ἀντὶ ὀδόντος, χεῖρα ἀντὶ 24
χειρός, πόδα ἀντὶ ποδός, κατάκαυμα ἀντὶ κατακαύματος, τραῦ- 25
μα ἀντὶ τραύματος, μώλωπα ἀντὶ μώλωπος. Ἐὰν δέ τις πατά- 26
ξῃ τὸν ὀφθαλμὸν τοῦ οἰκέτου αὐτοῦ, ἢ τὸν ὀφθαλμὸν τῆς θερα-
παίνης αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐκτυφλώσῃ αὐτόν, ἐλευθέρους ἐξαποστελεῖ αὐτούς
ἀντὶ τοῦ ὀφθαλμοῦ αὐτῶν. Ἐὰν δὲ τὸν ὀδόντα τοῦ οἰκέτου, ἢ τὸν 27
ὀδόντα τῆς θεραπαίνης αὐτοῦ ἐκκόψῃ, ἐλευθέρους ἐξαποστελεῖ αὐ-
τοὺς ἀντὶ τοῦ ὀδόντος αὐτῶν. Ἐὰν δὲ κερατίσῃ ταῦρος ἄνδρα ἢ 28:
γυναῖκα, καὶ ἀποθάνῃ, λίθοις λιθοβοληθήσεται ὁ ταῦρος, καὶ οὐ
βρωθήσεται τὰ κρέα αὐτοῦ· ὁ δὲ κύριος τοῦ ταύρου ἀθῶος ἔσται.
Ἐὰν δὲ ὁ ταῦρος κερατιστής ᾖ πρὸ τῆς ἐχθὲς καὶ πρὸ τῆς τρίτης, 29.
καὶ διαμαρτύρωνται τῷ κυρίῳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ μὴ ἀφανίσῃ αὐτόν, ἀνέλῃ
δὲ ἄνδρα, ἢ γυναῖκα, ὁ ταῦρος λιθοβοληθήσεται, καὶ ὁ κύριος αὐ-
τοῦ προσαποθανεῖται. Ἐὰν δὲ λύτρα ἐπιβληθῇ αὐτῷ, δώσει λύτρα 30
τῆς ψυχῆς αὐτοῦ κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἂν ἐπιβάλῃ αὐτῷ. Ἐὰν δὲ υἱὸν 31
κερατίσῃ ἢ θυγατέρα, κατὰ τὸ δικαίωμα τοῦτο ποιήσουσιν αὐτῷ.
Ἐὰν δὲ παῖδα κερατίσῃ ὁ ταῦρος ἢ παιδίσκην, ἀργυρίου τριά- 32

**EXODUS**
**Chapter 21**

**13** ...delivered him into his hands, then will I appoint thee a place whither he that hath slain him may flee.

**14** But if any man shall lie in wait for his neighbor, to slay him with guile, and he fleeth [for refuge], then shalt thou take him from Mine altar, that he may be put to death.

**15** He that smiteth his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.

**16** He that revileth his father or his mother shall surely die.

**17** Whosoever shall steal any man of the sons of Israel, and having overpowered him shall sell him, and he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.

**18** And if two men strive together, and one strike his neighbor with a stone or with a fist, and he die not, but be laid upon his bed;

**19** if (δὲ) the man shall rise up and walk abroad upon his staff, then he that struck him shall be innocent: only he shall pay for his loss of time, and for the expenses of his healing.

**20** And if a man smite his male slave or his female slave with a rod, and [the slave] die under his hand, he shall surely be avenged;

**21** but if [the slave] survive for one day or two, he shall not be avenged: for the silver thereof is his.

**22** And if two men strive together, and strike a woman with child, and her child depart from her not yet formed, he shall surely be fined; inasmuch as the husband of the woman shall lay a charge, and he shall give [a fine] according to a [judicial] assessment;

**23** but if it be formed, then he shall give life for life,

**24** eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,

**25** burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.

**26** And if a man strike the eye of his male slave or the eye of his female slave, and shall blind him, he shall send them away free in return for their eye.

**27** And if he knock out the tooth of his male slave or the tooth of his female slave, he shall send them away free in return for their tooth.

**28** And if a bull gore a man or a woman, and [the person] die, the bull shall surely be stoned with stones, and its flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the bull shall be innocent.

**29** But if the bull be a gorer before yesterday and before the third day, and they have testified to its owner, and he hath not kept it in, and it slay a man or a woman, the bull shall be stoned, and its owner shall also surely die.

**30** If a ransom be laid upon him, then he shall give a ransom for his life, according to all that which is laid upon him.

**31** If it gore a son or a daughter, according to this ordinance shall they deal with him.

**32** If the bull gore a male slave or a female slave, he shall give thirty didrachmas of silver to their owner, and the bull shall be stoned.
