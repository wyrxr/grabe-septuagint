4           ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ                          ΚΕΦ. Βʹ. Γʹ.
15 συρίων. Ὁ δὲ ποταμὸς ὁ τέταρτος, οὗτος Εὐφράτης. Καὶ ἔλαβε
           Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τὸν ἄνθρωπον ὃν ἔπλασε, καὶ ἔθετο αὐτὸν ἐν τῷ
16 παραδείσῳ τῆς τρυφῆς, ἐργάζεσθαι αὐτὸν καὶ φυλάσσειν. Καὶ ἐ-
           νετείλατο Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τῷ Ἀδάμ, λέγων· ἀπὸ παντὸς ξύλου
17 τοῦ ἐν τῷ παραδείσῳ, βρώσει φάγῃ· ἀπὸ δὲ τοῦ ξύλου τοῦ γι-
           νώσκειν καλὸν καὶ πονηρόν, οὐ φάγεσθε ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ· ᾗ δ’ ἂν ἡ-
18 μέρᾳ φάγησθε ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ, θανάτῳ ἀποθανεῖσθε. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος ὁ
           Θεός· οὐ καλόν, εἶναι τὸν ἄνθρωπον μόνον· ποιήσωμεν αὐτῷ βοη-
19 θὸν κατ’ αὐτόν. Καὶ ἔπλασεν ὁ Θεὸς ἔτι ἐκ τῆς γῆς πάντα τὰ
           θηρία τοῦ ἀγροῦ καὶ πάντα τὰ πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ ἤγαγεν
           αὐτὰ πρὸς τὸν Ἀδάμ, ἰδεῖν τί καλέσει αὐτά· καὶ πᾶν ὃ ἐὰν ἐ-
20 κάλεσεν αὐτὸ Ἀδὰμ ψυχὴν ζῶσαν, τοῦτο ὄνομα αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐκά-
           λεσεν Ἀδὰμ ὀνόματα πᾶσι τοῖς κτήνεσι, καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς πετεινοῖς
           τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς θηρίοις τοῦ ἀγροῦ· τῷ τε Ἀδὰμ οὐχ
21 εὑρέθη βοηθὸς ὅμοιος αὐτῷ. Καὶ ἐπέβαλε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἔκ-
           στασιν ἐπὶ τὸν Ἀδάμ, καὶ ὕπνωσε· καὶ ἔλαβε μίαν τῶν πλευρῶν
22 αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀνεπλήρωσε σάρκα ἀντ’ αὐτῆς. Καὶ ᾠκοδόμησε Κύριος
           ὁ Θεὸς τὴν πλευράν, ἣν ἔλαβεν ἀπὸ τοῦ Ἀδάμ, εἰς γυναῖκα,
23 καὶ ἤγαγεν αὐτὴν πρὸς τὸν Ἀδάμ. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἀδάμ· τοῦτο νῦν
           ὀστοῦν ἐκ τῶν ὀστέων μου, καὶ σὰρξ ἐκ τῆς σαρκός μου· αὕτη
24 κληθήσεται γυνή, ὅτι ἐκ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς αὐτῆς ἐλήφθη αὕτη. Ἕνεκεν
           τούτου καταλείψει ἄνθρωπος τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ καὶ τὴν μητέρα
           αὐτοῦ, καὶ προσκολληθήσεται τῇ γυναικὶ αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἔσονται οἱ δύο
25 εἰς σάρκα μίαν. Καὶ ἦσαν οἱ δύο γυμνοί, ὅ τε Ἀδὰμ καὶ ἡ γυνὴ
           αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἠσχύνοντο.

           ΚΕΦ. Γʹ. ΙΙΙ.

1          Ὁ δὲ ὄφις ἦν φρονιμώτατος πάντων τῶν θηρίων τῶν ἐπὶ τῆς
           γῆς, ὧν ἐποίησε Κύριος ὁ Θεός. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ ὄφις τῇ γυναικί· τί ὅτι
           εἶπεν ὁ Θεός· οὐ μὴ φάγητε ἀπὸ παντὸς ξύλου τοῦ παραδείσου.
2 Καὶ εἶπεν ἡ γυνὴ τῷ ὄφει· ἀπὸ παντὸς ξύλου τοῦ παραδείσου
3 φαγούμεθα· ἀπὸ δὲ καρποῦ τοῦ ξύλου, ὃ ἔστιν ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ πα-
           ραδείσου, εἶπεν ὁ Θεός, οὐ φάγεσθε ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ, οὐδὲ μὴ ἅψησθε
4          αὐτοῦ, ἵνα μὴ ἀποθάνητε. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ ὄφις τῇ γυναικί· οὐ θα-
5 νάτῳ ἀποθανεῖσθε. Ἤδει γὰρ ὁ Θεός, ὅτι ἐν ᾗ ἂν ἡμέρᾳ φάγη-

**GENESIS, CHAPTER II.**

15 And the fourth river, this is Euphrates. And the Lord God took the man whom He had formed, and placed him in the paradise of delight, to work it and to keep it.
16 And the Lord God commanded Adam, saying, “From every tree that is in the paradise, eating thou shalt eat;
17 but from the tree of knowing good and evil, ye shall not eat from it; for in whatsoever day ye shall eat from it, by death ye shall die.”
18 And the Lord God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone; let Us make for him a helper according to him.”
19 And God formed yet from the earth all the beasts of the field and all the fowl of the air, and He brought them unto Adam, to see what he would call them; and whatsoever Adam called it, a living soul, that same was the name thereof.
20 And Adam called names to all cattle, and to all fowl of the air, and to all beasts of the field; but for Adam there was not found a helper like unto him.
21 And the Lord God cast a trance upon Adam, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and filled up flesh instead thereof.
22 And the Lord God built the rib, which He had taken from Adam, into a woman, and brought her unto Adam.
23 And Adam said, “This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; this shall be called Woman, because from her man was she taken.”
24 For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife; and they two shall be one flesh.
25 And they two were naked, Adam and his wife, and were not ashamed.

**CHAPTER III.**

1 Now the serpent was the most subtle of all the beasts upon the earth, which the Lord God had made. And the serpent said unto the woman, “What [is this], that God hath said: 'Ye shall not eat from every tree of the paradise'?”
2 And the woman said unto the serpent, “From every tree of the paradise we shall eat;
3 but from the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the paradise, God hath said, 'Ye shall not eat from it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.'”
4 And the serpent said unto the woman, “By death ye shall not die.
5 For God doth know that in whatsoever day ye shall eat—
