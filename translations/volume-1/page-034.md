ΚΕΦ. ΙΒʹ. Ηʹ.                       ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ 19
ὄρος κατ᾽ ἀνατολὰς Βαιθὴλ, καὶ ἔστησεν ἐκεῖ τὴν σκηνὴν αὐτοῦ
ἐν Βαιθὴλ κατὰ θάλασσαν, καὶ ᾿Αγγαὶ κατ᾽ ἀνατολὰς· καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν ἐκεῖ θυσιαστήριον τῷ Κυρίῳ, καὶ ἐπεκαλέσατο ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι Κυρίου. Καὶ ἀπῆρεν ῎Αβραμ, καὶ πορευθεὶς ἐστρατοπέδευσεν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ. Καὶ ἐγένετο λιμὸς ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς· καὶ κατέβη 10
῎Αβραμ εἰς Αἴγυπτον παροικῆσαι ἐκεῖ, ὅτι ἐνίσχυσεν ὁ λιμὸς ἐπὶ
τῆς γῆς. Ἐγένετο δὲ ἡνίκα ἤγγισεν ῎Αβραμ εἰσελθεῖν εἰς Αἴγυπτον, εἶπεν ῎Αβραμ Σάρᾳ τῇ γυναικὶ αὐτοῦ· γινώσκω ἐγὼ ὅτι γυνὴ εὐπρόσωπος εἶ. Ἔσται οὖν ὡς ἂν ἴδωσί σε οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι, ἐροῦσιν, 12
ὅτι γυνὴ αὐτοῦ ἐστιν αὕτη· καὶ ἀποκτενοῦσί με, σὲ δὲ περιποιήσονται. Εἰπὸν οὖν, ὅτι ἀδελφὴ αὐτοῦ εἰμι, ὅπως ἂν εὖ μοι γένηται διὰ σὲ, καὶ ζήσεται ἡ ψυχή μου ἕνεκέν σου. Ἐγένετο δὲ 14
ἡνίκα εἰσῆλθεν ῎Αβραμ εἰς Αἴγυπτον, ἰδόντες οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι τὴν
γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ, ὅτι καλὴ ἦν σφόδρα· καὶ ἴδον αὐτὴν οἱ ἄρχοντες 15
Φαραὼ, καὶ ἐπῄνεσαν αὐτὴν πρὸς Φαραὼ, καὶ εἰσήγαγον αὐτὴν
εἰς τὸν οἶκον Φαραώ. Καὶ τῷ ῎Αβραμ εὖ ἐχρήσαντο δι᾽ αὐτὴν 16
καὶ ἐγένοντο αὐτῷ πρόβατα, καὶ μόσχοι, καὶ ὄνοι, καὶ παῖδες, καὶ
παιδίσκαι, καὶ ἡμίονοι, καὶ κάμηλοι. Καὶ ἤτασεν ὁ Θεὸς τὸν Φαραὼ ἐτασμοῖς μεγάλαις καὶ πονηροῖς, καὶ τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ, περὶ
Σάρας τῆς γυναικὸς ῎Αβραμ. Καλέσας δὲ Φαραὼ τὸν ῎Αβραμ, 18
εἶπε· τί τοῦτο ἐποίησάς μοι ὅτι οὐκ ἀπήγγειλάς μοι, ὅτι γυνὴ
σου ἐστίν; ἱνατί εἶπας, ὅτι ἀδελφή μου ἐστίν; καὶ ἔλαβον αὐτὴν 19
ἐμαυτῷ εἰς γυναῖκα. Καὶ νῦν ἰδοὺ ἡ γυνή σου ἐναντίον σου· λαβὼν ἀπότρεχε. Καὶ ἐνετείλατο Φαραὼ ἀνδράσι περὶ ῎Αβραμ, συμπροπέμψαι αὐτὸν, καὶ τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἦν αὐτῷ, καὶ Λὼτ μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ.

KΕΦ. ΙΓʹ. ΧΙΙΙ.

ΑΝΕΒΗ δὲ ῎Αβραμ ἐξ Αἰγύπτου αὐτὸς, καὶ ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ, 1
καὶ πάντα τὰ αὐτοῦ, καὶ Λὼτ μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ εἰς τὴν ἔρημον. ῎Αβραμ δὲ ἦν πλούσιος σφόδρα κτήνεσι, καὶ ἀργυρίῳ, καὶ χρυσίῳ.
Καὶ ἐπορεύθη ὅθεν ἦλθεν, εἰς τὴν ἔρημον ἕως Βαιθὴλ, ἕως τοῦ 3
τόπου οὗ ἦν ἡ σκηνὴ αὐτοῦ τὸ πρότερον, ἀνὰ μέσον Βαιθὴλ καὶ
ἀνὰ μέσον ᾿Αγγαι, εἰς τὸν τόπον τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου, οὗ ἐποίησεν 4
ἐκεῖ τὴν ἀρχὴν, καὶ ἐπεκαλέσατο ἐκεῖ ῎Αβραμ τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου.

**GENESIS 12**

⁸ the mountain to the east of Bethel; and he pitched his tent there, having Bethel toward the west, and Aggai toward the east. And he built there an altar to the Lord, and he called upon the name of the Lord.

⁹ And Abram departed thence, and going forth, he sojourned in the wilderness.

¹⁰ And there came to pass a famine upon the land; and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there, because the famine was sore upon the land.

¹¹ And it came to pass, when Abram drew near to enter into Egypt, that Abram said unto Sarai his wife, "I know that thou art a woman of fair countenance. ¹² Therefore it shall be, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they will say, 'This is his wife'; and they will slay me, but they will save thee alive. ¹³ Say therefore, I pray thee, that thou art my sister, that it may be well with me for thy sake, and that my soul may live because of thee."

¹⁴ And it came to pass, when Abram was come into Egypt, that the Egyptians beheld his wife, for she was exceedingly fair. ¹⁵ And the princes of Pharaoh saw her, and they praised her unto Pharaoh; and they brought her into Pharaoh’s house. ¹⁶ And Pharaoh dealt well with Abram for her sake; and he came to have sheep, and oxen, and donkeys, and menservants, and maidservants, and mules, and camels.

¹⁷ And God afflicted Pharaoh with great and evil afflictions, and his house also, because of Sarai, Abram’s wife. ¹⁸ Then Pharaoh called Abram, and said, "What is this that thou hast done unto me? Why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife? ¹⁹ Wherefore saidst thou, 'She is my sister,' so that I took her to myself for a wife? Now therefore behold thy wife before thee; take [her], and go thy way."

²⁰ And Pharaoh gave charge to his men concerning Abram, that they should send him forth, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him.

**GENESIS 13**

¹ Then Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the desert.

² Now Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold.

³ And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the first, between Bethel and ⁴ between Aggai; unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the beginning; and there Abram called upon the name of the Lord.
