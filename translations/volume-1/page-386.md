ΚΕΦ. ΛΒ΄. ΔΕΥΤΕΡΟΝΟΜΙΟΝ 371
αὐτῶν ἐκ Γομόῤῥας· ἡ σταφυλὴ αὐτῶν σταφυλὴ χολῆς, βότρυς πι-
κρίας αὐτοῖς· θυμὸς δρακόντων ὁ οἶνος αὐτῶν, καὶ θυμὸς ἀσπί- 33
δων ἀνίατος. Οὐκ ἰδοὺ ταῦτα συνήχται παρ᾿ ἐμοί, καὶ ἐσφράγι- 34
σται ἐν τοῖς θησαυροῖς μου; ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ἐκδικήσεως ἀνταποδώσω, ἐν 35
καιρῷ ὅταν σφαλῇ ὁ ποὺς αὐτῶν· ὅτι ἐγγὺς ἡμέρα ἀπωλείας αὑ-
τῶν, καὶ πάρεστιν ἕτοιμα ὑμῖν. Ὅτι κρινεῖ Κύριος τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ, 36
καὶ ἐπὶ τοῖς δούλοις αὐτοῦ παρακληθήσεται· εἶδε γὰρ παραλελυμέ-
νους αὐτοὺς καὶ ἐκλελοιπότας ἐν ἐπαγωγῇ καὶ παρειμένους. Καὶ εἶ- 37
πε Κύριος· ποῦ εἰσιν οἱ θεοὶ αὐτῶν, ἐφ᾿ οἷς ἐπεποίθεισαν ἐπ᾿
αὐτοῖς; ὧν τὸ στέαρ τῶν θυσιῶν αὐτῶν ἐσθίετε, καὶ ἐπίνετε τὸν 38
οἶνον τῶν σπονδῶν αὐτῶν; ἀναστήτωσαν καὶ βοηθησάτωσαν ὑμῖν,
καὶ γενηθήτωσαν ὑμῖν σκεπασταί. Ἴδετε ἴδετε ὅτι ἐγὼ εἰμι, καὶ οὐκ 39
ἔστι θεὸς πλὴν ἐμοῦ· ἐγὼ ἀποκτενῶ, καὶ ζῆν ποιήσω· πατάξω,
κἀγὼ ἰάσομαι, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ὃς ἐξελεῖται ἐκ τῶν χειρῶν μου. Ὅ- 40
τι ἀρῶ εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν τὴν χεῖρά μου, καὶ ὀμοῦμαι τὴν δεξιάν μου,
καὶ ἐρῶ· Ζῶ ἐγὼ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα· ὅτι παροξυνῶ ὡς ἀστραπὴν τὴν μά- 41
χαιράν μου, καὶ ἀνθέξεται χρήματος ἡ χείρ μου, (καὶ ἐκδικήσει),
καὶ ἀνταποδώσω δίκην τοῖς ἐχθροῖς μου, καὶ τοῖς μισοῦσί με ἀν-
ταποδώσω· μεθύσω τὰ βέλη μου ἀφ᾿ αἵματος, καὶ ἡ μάχαιρά μου 42
καταφάγεται κρέα, ἀφ᾿ αἵματος τραυματιῶν καὶ αἰχμαλωσίας, ἀπὸ
κεφαλῆς ἀρχόντων ἐχθρῶν. Εὐφράνθητε οὐρανοὶ ἅμα αὐτῷ, καὶ 43
προσκυνησάτωσαν αὐτῷ πάντες υἱοὶ Θεοῦ· εὐφράνθητε ἔθνη μετὰ
τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐνισχυσάτωσαν αὐτοὺς πάντες ἄγγελοι Θεοῦ·
ἔτι τὸ αἷμα τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ ἐκδικεῖται, καὶ ἐκδικήσει, καὶ ἀντα-
ποδώσει δίκην τοῖς ἐχθροῖς αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοῖς μισοῦσιν ἀνταποδώ-
σει· καὶ ἐκκαθαριεῖ Κύριος τὴν γῆν τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἔγραψε 44
Μωυσῆς τὴν ᾠδὴν ταύτην ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ, καὶ ἐδίδαξεν αὐ-
τὴν τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ· καὶ προσῆλθε Μωυσῆς πρὸς τὸν λαόν,
καὶ ἐλάλησε πάντας τοὺς λόγους τοῦ νόμου τούτου εἰς τὰ ὦτα
τοῦ λαοῦ, αὐτὸς καὶ Ἰησοῦς ὁ τοῦ Ναυῆ. Καὶ συνετέλεσε Μωυ- 45
σῆς λαλῶν πάντας τοὺς λόγους τούτους παντὶ Ἰσραήλ· καὶ εἶ- 46
πε πρὸς αὐτούς· προσέχετε τῇ καρδίᾳ ὑμῶν ἐπὶ πάντας τοὺς λό-
γους τούτους, οὓς ἐγὼ διαμαρτύρομαι ὑμῖν σήμερον, ἃ ἐντελεῖσθε
τοῖς υἱοῖς ὑμῶν, φυλάσσειν καὶ ποιεῖν πάντας τοὺς λόγους τοῦ
νόμου τούτου. Ὅτι οὐχὶ λόγος κενὸς οὗτος ὑμῖν· ὅτι αὕτη ἡ ζωὴ 47
ὑμῶν, καὶ ἕνεκεν τοῦ λόγου τούτου μακροημερεύσετε ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς,

**Deuteronomy 32**

32 Their vine is of Gomorrah; their grape is a grape of gall, a cluster of bitterness unto them.
33 Their wine is the venom of dragons, and the incurable venom of asps.
34 Behold, are not these things laid up with Me, and sealed in My treasuries?
35 In the day of vengeance will I recompense, in the time when their foot shall stumble; for the day of their destruction is near, and the things prepared are present unto you.
36 For the LORD shall judge His people, and will have compassion upon His servants; for He saw them utterly paralyzed and spent in [their] affliction, and cast down.
37 And the LORD said, "Where are their gods, in whom they had put their trust?
38 Whose fat of their sacrifices did ye eat, and drank the wine of their libations? Let them arise and help you, and let them be your protectors!"
39 See, see that I am He, and there is no God beside Me; I kill, and I make alive; I strike, and I heal; and there is none who can deliver out of My hands.
40 For I will lift up My hand unto heaven, and will swear by My right hand, and will say, "I live for ever!"
41 For I will whet My sword as lightning, and My hand shall grasp requital (and it shall take vengeance); and I will render judgment to My enemies, and to those who hate Me will I recompense.
42 I will make My arrows drunk with blood, and My sword shall devour flesh, with the blood of the wounded and of the captives, from the head of the chief of the enemies.
43 Rejoice, O ye heavens, with Him; and let all the sons of God worship Him! Rejoice, O ye nations, with His people; and let all the angels of God strengthen them! Yet the blood of His sons is avenged, and He shall avenge, and render judgment to His enemies, and to those who hate Him shall He recompense; and the LORD shall cleanse the land of His people.
44 And Moses wrote this song in that same day, and taught it unto the sons of Israel. And Moses came unto the people, and spoke all the words of this Law in the ears of the people, he himself and Jesus [Joshua] the son of Nave [Nun].
45 And Moses finished speaking all these words to all Israel.
46 And he said unto them, "Set your hearts unto all these words, which I testify unto you this day, that ye may command your sons to keep and to do all the words of this Law.
47 For this is no vain word unto you; for it is your life, and by reason of this word shall ye prolong your days upon the land,"
