ΚΕΦ. ΛΒ΄. ΛΓ΄. ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ 59
24 Ὑπελείφθη δὲ Ἰακὼβ μόνος· καὶ ἐπάλαισε μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἄνθρωπος ἕως πρωΐ.
25 Εἶδε δὲ ὅτι οὐ δύναται πρὸς αὐτόν, καὶ ἥψατο τοῦ πλάτους τοῦ μηροῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐνάρκησε τὸ πλάτος τοῦ μηροῦ Ἰακὼβ ἐν τῷ παλαίειν αὐτὸν μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ.
26 Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· ἀπόστειλόν με, ἀνέβη γὰρ ὁ ὄρθρος. Ὁ δὲ εἶπεν· οὐ μή σε ἀποστείλω, ἐὰν μὴ εὐλογήσῃς με.
27 Εἶπε δὲ αὐτῷ· τί τὸ ὄνομά σου ἐστίν; Ὁ δὲ εἶπεν· Ἰακώβ.
28 Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· οὐ κληθήσεται ἔτι τὸ ὄνομά σου Ἰακώβ, ἀλλὰ Ἰσραὴλ τὸ ὄνομά σου ἔσται· ὅτι ἐνίσχυσας μετὰ Θεοῦ, καὶ μετὰ ἀνθρώπων δυνατός.
29 Ἠρώτησε δὲ Ἰακώβ, καὶ εἶπεν· ἀνάγγειλόν μοι τὸ ὄνομά σου. Καὶ εἶπεν· ἵνατί τοῦτο (σὺ) ἐρωτᾷς τὸ ὄνομά μου; καὶ ηὐλόγησεν αὐτὸν ἐκεῖ.
30 Καὶ ἐκάλεσεν Ἰακὼβ τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ τόπου ἐκείνου, Εἶδος Θεοῦ· ἴδον γὰρ Θεὸν πρόσωπον πρὸς πρόσωπον, καὶ ἐσώθη μου ἡ ψυχή.
31 Ἀνέτειλε δὲ αὐτῷ ὁ ἥλιος, ἡνίκα παρῆλθε τὸ Εἶδος τοῦ Θεοῦ· αὐτὸς δὲ ἐπέσκαζε τῷ μηρῷ αὐτοῦ.
32 Ἕνεκεν γὰρ τούτου οὐ μὴ φάγωσιν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ τὸ νεῦρον, ὃ ἐνάρκησεν, ὅ ἐστιν ἐπὶ τοῦ πλάτους τοῦ μηροῦ (Ἰακώβ), ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης· ὅτι ἥψατο τοῦ πλάτους τοῦ μηροῦ Ἰακὼβ τοῦ νεύρου, καὶ ἐνάρκησεν.

ΚΕΦ. ΛΓ΄. XXXIII.
1 ἈΝΑΒΛΕΨΑΣ δὲ Ἰακὼβ τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτοῦ, ἴδε, καὶ ἰδοὺ Ἠσαῦ ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ ἐρχόμενος, αὐτὸς καὶ τετρακόσιοι ἄνδρες μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ.
2 Καὶ ἐπεδίειλεν Ἰακὼβ τὰ παιδία ἐπὶ Λείαν, καὶ ἐπὶ Ῥαχὴλ, καὶ τὰς δύο παιδίσκας· καὶ ἐποίησε τὰς δύο παιδίσκας καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτῶν ἐν πρώτοις, καὶ Λείαν καὶ τὰ παιδία αὐτῆς ὀπίσω, καὶ Ῥαχὴλ καὶ Ἰωσὴφ ἐσχάτους.
3 Αὐτὸς δὲ παρῆλθεν ἔμπροσθεν αὐτῶν, καὶ προσεκύνησεν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ἑπτάκις, ἕως τοῦ ἐγγίσαι τῷ ἀδελφῷ αὐτοῦ.
4 Καὶ προσέδραμεν Ἠσαῦ εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτῷ, καὶ περιλαβὼν αὐτὸν ἐφίλησε, καὶ προσέπεσεν ἐπὶ τὸν τράχηλον αὐτοῦ, καὶ κατεφίλησεν αὐτόν· καὶ ἔκλαυσαν ἀμφότεροι.
5 Καὶ ἀναβλέψας ἴδε τὰς γυναῖκας καὶ τὰ παιδία, καὶ εἶπε· τί ταῦτά σοι ἐστίν; Ὁ δὲ εἶπε· τὰ παιδία, οἷς ἠλέησεν ὁ Θεὸς τὸν παῖδά σου.
6 Καὶ προσήγγισαν αἱ παιδίσκαι καὶ τὰ παιδία αὐτῶν, καὶ προσεκύνησαν·
7 καὶ προσήγγισε Λεία καὶ τὰ τέκνα αὐτῆς, καὶ προσεκύνησαν· καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα προσήγγισε Ῥαχὴλ καὶ Ἰωσήφ,

### Chapter 32

**24** Now Jacob was left alone; and a Man wrestled with him until the break of day.
**25** And He saw that He could not prevail against him; and He touched the breadth of his thigh, and the breadth of Jacob's thigh was stiffened as he wrestled with Him.
**26** And He said unto him, "Let me go, for the dawn hath risen." And he said, "I will not let thee go, except thou bless me."
**27** And He said unto him, "What is thy name?" And he said, "Jacob."
**28** And He said unto him, "Thy name shall no more be called Jacob, but Israel shall thy name be; for thou hast prevailed with God, and art mighty with men."
**29** And Jacob asked [Him], and said, "Declare to me, I pray thee, thy name." And He said, "Wherefore is it that thou dost ask this, [even] My name?" And He blessed him there.
**30** And Jacob called the name of that place, "The Form of God"; for, he said, "I have seen God face to face, and my soul hath been saved."
**31** And the sun rose upon him as he passed by the Form of God; and he limped upon his thigh.
**32** Therefore, unto this day, the sons of Israel do not eat the sinew which was stiffened, which is upon the breadth of the thigh (of Jacob); for He touched the breadth of Jacob's thigh, even the sinew, and it was stiffened.

### Chapter 33

**1** And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and saw, and behold, Esau his brother was coming, himself and four hundred men with him.
**2** And Jacob divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two maidservants; and he placed the two maidservants and their sons in the forefront, and Leah and her children behind them, and Rachel and Joseph last.
**3** And he himself passed on before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he drew near unto his brother.
**4** And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and fell upon his neck, and kissed him fervently; and they both wept.
**5** And [Esau] lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children, and said, "What are these unto thee?" And [Jacob] said, "The children whom God hath graciously given thy servant."
**6** And the maidservants and their children drew near, and bowed themselves.
**7** And Leah and her children drew near, and bowed themselves; and after these, Rachel and Joseph drew near,
