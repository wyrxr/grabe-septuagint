ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ
ΕΦ. ΜΖ΄. XLVI.

1 ἈΠΑΡΑΣ δὲ Ἰσραήλ, αὐτὸς καὶ πάντα τὰ τὸ φρέαρ τοῦ ὅρκου· καὶ ἔθυσεν (ἐκεῖ) θυσίαν τῷ Θεῷ τοῦ πατρὸς
2 αὐτοῦ Ἰσαάκ. Εἶπε δὲ ὁ Θεὸς πρὸς Ἰσραὴλ ἐν ὁράματι τῆς νυκτός,
3 εἴπας· Ἰακώβ, Ἰακώβ. Ὁ δὲ εἶπε· τί ἐστι; Καὶ εἶπεν· ἐγώ
εἰμι ὁ Θεὸς τῶν πατέρων σου, μὴ φοβοῦ καταβῆναι εἰς Αἴγυπτον·
4 εἰς γὰρ ἔθνος μέγα ποιήσω σε ἐκεῖ· καὶ ἐγὼ καταβήσομαι μετὰ
σοῦ εἰς Αἴγυπτον, καὶ ἐγὼ ἀναβιβάσω σε εἰς τέλος· καὶ Ἰωσὴφ
5 ἐπιβαλεῖ τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς σου. Ἀνέστη δὲ
Ἰακὼβ ἀπὸ τοῦ φρέατος τοῦ ὅρκου· καὶ ἀνέλαβον οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ
6 Ἰακὼβ τὸν πατέρα αὐτῶν, καὶ τὴν ἀποσκευήν, καὶ τὰς γυναῖκας
αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τὰς ἁμάξας, ἃς ἀπέστειλεν Ἰωσήφ, ἄραι αὐτὸν· καὶ
ἀναλαβόντες τὰ ὑπάρχοντα αὐτῶν, καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν κτῆσιν αὐτῶν,
ἣν ἐκτήσαντο ἐν γῇ Χαναάν, καὶ εἰσῆλθεν Ἰακὼβ εἰς Αἴγυπτον,
7 καὶ πᾶν τὸ σπέρμα αὐτοῦ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ· υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ τῶν
υἱῶν αὐτοῦ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, θυγατέρες αὐτοῦ καὶ θυγατέρες τῶν υἱῶν
αὐτοῦ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ· καὶ πᾶν τὸ σπέρμα αὐτοῦ ἤγαγεν εἰς Αἴγυπτον.
8 Ταῦτα δὲ τὰ ὀνόματα τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ τῶν εἰσελθόντων
εἰς Αἴγυπτον, Ἰακὼβ καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ· πρωτότοκος Ἰακώβ, Ῥουβήν.
9 Υἱοὶ δὲ Ῥουβήν· Ἑνώχ, καὶ Φαλλοῦδ, καὶ Ἀσρών, καὶ Χαρμεί.
10 Υἱοὶ δὲ Συμεών· Ἰεμουήλ, καὶ Ἰαμείν, καὶ Ἀώδ, καὶ Ἰαχείν, καὶ
11 Σαάρ, καὶ Σαούλ, υἱὸς τῆς Χαναανίτιδος. Υἱοὶ δὲ Λευί· Γηρσών,
12 Καὰθ καὶ Μεραρεί. Υἱοὶ δὲ Ἰούδα· Ἤρ, καὶ Αὐνάν, καὶ Σηλώμ,
καὶ Φαρές, καὶ Ζαρά· ἀπέθανε δὲ Ἤρ καὶ Αὐνὰν ἐν γῇ Χαναάν.
Ἐγένοντο δὲ υἱοὶ Φαρές· Ἀσρών, καὶ Ἰεμουήλ. Υἱοὶ δὲ Ἰσσάχαρ·
13 Θωλά, καὶ Φουά, καὶ Ἰασούβ, καὶ Σαμβράν. Υἱοὶ δὲ Ζαβουλών·
14 Σερέδ, καὶ Ἀλλών, καὶ Ἀχοήλ. Οὗτοι υἱοὶ Λείας, οὓς ἔτεκε τῷ
15 Ἰακὼβ ἐν Μεσοποταμίᾳ τῆς Συρίας, καὶ Δείναν τὴν θυγατέρα αὐτοῦ·
πᾶσαι αἱ ψυχαὶ υἱοὶ καὶ θυγατέρες, τριάκοντα τρεῖς.
16 Υἱοὶ δὲ Γάδ· Σαφών, καὶ Ἀγγεῖς, καὶ Σαυελίς, καὶ Θασοβάν, καὶ Ἀηδείς, καὶ
17 Ἀροηδείς, καὶ Ἀροηλείς. Υἱοὶ δὲ Ἀσήρ· Ἰεμνὰ καὶ Ἰεσσουά, καὶ
Ἰεσούλ, καὶ Βαριά, καὶ Σάρα ἀδελφὴ αὐτῶν. Υἱοὶ δὲ Βαριά· Χοβώρ,
18 καὶ Μελχιήλ. Οὗτοι υἱοὶ Ζελφᾶς, ἣν ἔδωκε Λάβαν Λείᾳ τῇ θυγατρὶ
19 αὐτοῦ, ᾗ ἔτεκε τούτους τῷ Ἰακώβ, δεκαέξ ψυχάς. Υἱοὶ δὲ Ῥαχήλ,

### Genesis XLVI

1 And Israel, departing, he and all the things the well of the oath; and he sacrificed (there) a sacrifice unto the God of his father
2 Isaac. Then God spake unto Israel in a vision of the night, saying:
3 “Jacob, Jacob!” And he said, “What is it?” And He said, “I
am the God of thy fathers; fear thou not to go down into Egypt:
4 for a great nation will I make of thee there. And I will go down with thee into Egypt, and I will surely bring thee up again; and Joseph
5 shall lay his hands upon thine eyes.”
And Jacob rose up from the well of the oath; and the sons of Israel took up
6 Jacob their father, and their baggage, and their wives upon the wagons, which Joseph had sent to carry him. And they took up their possessions and all their substance, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and Jacob came into Egypt,
7 and all his seed with him: his sons, and his sons' sons with him; his daughters, and his sons' daughters with him; and all his seed he brought into Egypt.

8 Now these are the names of the sons of Israel who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.
9 And the sons of Reuben: Enoch, and Phalloud, and Asron, and Charmei.

11 Saar, and Saul, the son of the Canaanitess.
And the sons of Levi: Gerson,
12 Kaath, and Merarei.
And the sons of Judah: Er, and Aunán, and Selom, and Phares, and Zara. And Er and Aunán died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Phares were Asron and Jemuel.
And the sons of Issachar:
13 Thola, and Phoua, and Jasoub, and Sambran.
And the sons of Zebulun:
14 Sered, and Allon, and Achoel.
These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore unto
15 Jacob in Mesopotamia of Syria, and Deinán his daughter. All the souls, sons and daughters, were thirty-three.

16 And the sons of Gad: Saphon, and Aggeis, and Sauelis, and Thasoban, and Aedeis, and
17 Aroedeis, and Aroleis.
And the sons of Asher: Jemna, and Jessoua, and Jessoul, and Baria, and Sara their sister. And the sons of Baria: Chobor,
18 and Melchiel.
These are the sons of Zelphas, whom Laban gave unto Leah his daughter, and she bore these unto Jacob, sixteen souls.
