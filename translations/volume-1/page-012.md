Τῷ ἐντυγχάνοντι.
ΟΙ μὲν τ᾿ ἀγαθὸν προαιρούμενοι καὶ τὴν τῆς θείας ἐντολῆς
ἐκπλήρωσιν ἐν τῷ ἀγαθοποιεῖν προτιθέμενοι, οὐδὲν τοῦ παρὰ
τῶν ἀνθρώπων ἐπαίνου δέονται, εἰς μόνον ἀφορῶντες τὸν μισθα-
ποδότην Κύριον, τὸν ἐφ᾽ ἑαυτὸν ἀναδεχόμενον πᾶν τὸ καὶ τοῖς
ἐλαχίστοις καὶ ἀσθενέσι γινόμενον, καὶ ταῖς πλουσίαις αὑτοῦ
ἀμείβοντα δωρεαῖς· (1) τοῖς δὲ τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ μετέχουσι καθῆκον
δήπου ἱερὸν οὐ μόνον εὐγνωμόνως ἔχειν πρὸς τοὺς ἀγαθο-
ποιοῦντας, ἀλλὰ καὶ ὁμολογεῖν τὴν εὐεργεσίαν πρὸς τοὺς
παρόντας, καὶ τῇ μνήμῃ παραδιδόναι τῶν ἐπιγιγνομένων, ἑαυ-
τῶν μᾶλλον ἢ ἐκείνων χάριν, τὸ μὲν, ἵνα μὴ αὐτοὶ σκαιοί τε
καὶ ἀγνώμονες δόξωσι, τὸ δὲ, ἵνα καὶ ἄλλους εἰς μίμησιν
τοῦ ἀγαθοποιεῖν προτρέψωνται. Τούτου γοῦν ἕνεκα καὶ τοῖς
ὑποφαινομένοις ἔδοξε βραχέα περὶ τῆς ἀνὰ χεῖρας ἐκτυπώσεως
ἀφηγήσασθαι, εὐγνωμοσύνης τε ἕνεκα, καὶ ὅπως οἱ ἐντυγχάνον-
τες αὐτῇ, εἰδότες πόθεν καὶ πῶς τὸ δώρημα τοῦτο ἔχουσι,
πρῶτον μὲν ἀνενδοιάστως τὰ λόγια τοῦ Θεοῦ ἀναγινώσκωσι,
μηδὲν ὀθνεῖον ἡ παράσημον ἐν αὐτοῖς παρεισδῦσαι ὑποτοπά-
ζοντες, εἶτα δὲ καὶ χάριτας τὰς δικαίας τοῖς δωρησαμένοις
ὁμολογῶσιν.

TO THE READER.

They that, indeed, choose the good,
and set before themselves the fulfillment of the divine commandment
in doing good,
have no need of praise from men;
for their gaze is fixed solely upon the Lord, the Giver of recompense,
He who takes upon Himself all that which is done
even unto the least and the weak,
and requites [them] with His bountiful gifts.
(1) But unto them that partake of the good,
it is, assuredly, a sacred duty,
not only to be grateful towards those who do good,
but also to acknowledge the benefaction unto those who are present,
and to commit it unto the memory of them that come after —
more, indeed, for their own sake than for the sake of those others.
This, that they themselves might not be accounted boorish and ungrateful;
and that, to the end that they might exhort others also unto the imitation of doing good.

For this cause, therefore, it seemed good unto us, the undersigned,
to declare a few things concerning this printing which is in our hands;
both for the sake of gratitude,
and to the end that they who encounter it,
knowing whence and how they have received this gift,
might, first, read the oracles of God without wavering,
suspecting that naught alien or spurious has crept into them;
and then also might render due thanks unto them who have bestowed [it].
