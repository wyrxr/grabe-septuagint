17 υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐξῆλθον εἰς τὰς πόλεις αὐτῶν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τρίτῃ· αἱ δὲ
18 πόλεις αὐτῶν Γαβαὼν καὶ Χεφειρὰ καὶ Βηρώθ, καὶ πόλις Ἰαρείμ. Καὶ
    οὐκ ἐμαχέσαντο αὐτοῖς οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ, ὅτι ὤμοσαν αὐτοῖς πάντες οἱ
    ἄρχοντες τῆς συναγωγῆς τὸν Κύριον Θεὸν Ἰσραήλ· καὶ διεγόγγυσαν
19 πᾶσα ἡ συναγωγὴ ἐπὶ τοῖς ἄρχουσι. Καὶ εἶπαν πάντες οἱ ἄρχοντες πάσῃ
    τῇ συναγωγῇ· ἡμεῖς ὠμόσαμεν αὐτοῖς Κύριον τὸν Θεὸν Ἰσραήλ,
20 καὶ νῦν οὐ δυνησόμεθα ἅλσασθαι αὐτῶν. Τοῦτο ποιήσομεν
    αὐτοῖς· ζωγρῆσαι αὐτούς, καὶ περιποιησόμεθα αὐτούς, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται
21 καθ᾿ ἡμῶν ὀργὴ διὰ τὸν ὅρκον, ὃν ὠμόσαμεν αὐτοῖς. Καὶ
    εἶπαν αὐτοῖς οἱ ἄρχοντες· ζήσονται, καὶ ἔσονται ξυλοκόποι καὶ
    ὑδροφόροι πάσῃ τῇ συναγωγῇ, καθάπερ εἶπαν αὐτοῖς οἱ ἄρχοντες.
22 Καὶ συνεκάλεσεν αὐτοὺς Ἰησοῦς, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς, λέγων· διατί παρελογίσασθέ
    με, λέγοντες· μακράν ἐσμεν ἀπὸ σοῦ σφόδρα; ὑμεῖς δὲ ἐγχώριοί
23 ἐστε τῶν κατοικούντων ἐν ἡμῖν. Καὶ νῦν ἐπικατάρατοι ἔστε· οὐ
    μὴ ἐκλείπῃ ἐξ ὑμῶν δοῦλος, οὐδὲ ξυλοκόπος οὐδὲ ὑδροφόρος, ἐμοὶ
24 καὶ τῷ Θεῷ μου. Καὶ ἀπεκρίθησαν τῷ Ἰησοῦ, λέγοντες· ὅτι ἀγγελία
    ἀπηγγέλη ἡμῖν, ὅσα συνέταξε Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου Μωυσῇ
    παιδὶ αὐτοῦ, δοῦναι ὑμῖν πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν ταύτην, καὶ ἐξολοθρεῦσαι
    ἡμᾶς καὶ πάντας τοὺς κατοικοῦντας ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς ἀπὸ προσώπου
    ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐφοβήθημεν σφόδρα περὶ τῶν ψυχῶν ἡμῶν ἀπὸ
25 προσώπου ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐποιήσαμεν τὸ πρᾶγμα τοῦτο. Καὶ νῦν ἰδοὺ
    ἡμεῖς ὑποχείριοι ὑμῖν, ὡς ἀρέσκει ὑμῖν καὶ ὡς δοκεῖ ὑμῖν ποιῆσαι,
    ποιῆσαι ἡμῖν. Καὶ ἐποίησαν αὐτοῖς οὕτως· καὶ ἐξείλατο αὐτοὺς
26 Ἰησοῦς ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἐκ χειρὸς υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ οὐκ
27 ἀνεῖλον αὐτούς. Καὶ κατέστησεν αὐτοὺς Ἰησοῦς ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ
    ξυλοκόπους καὶ ὑδροφόρους πάσῃ τῇ συναγωγῇ καὶ τῷ θυσιαστηρίῳ
    τοῦ Θεοῦ· διὰ τοῦτο ἐγένοντο οἱ κατοικοῦντες Γαβαὼν
    ξυλοκόποι καὶ ὑδροφόροι τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ἕως τῆς σήμερον
    ἡμέρας, καὶ εἰς τὸν τόπον ὃν ἂν ἐκλέξηται Κύριος.

ΚΕΦ. Ιʹ. Χ.

1 Ὡς δὲ ἤκουσεν Ἀδωνιβεζὲκ βασιλεὺς Ἱερουσαλὴμ ὅτι ἔλαβεν
    Ἰησοῦς τὴν Γαΐ, καὶ ἐξωλόθρευσε αὐτήν, ὃν τρόπον ἐποίησε τὴν
    Ἱεριχὼ καὶ τὸν βασιλέα αὐτῆς, οὕτως ἐποίησε καὶ τὴν Γαΐ καὶ
    τὸν βασιλέα αὐτῆς, καὶ ὅτι ηὐτομόλησαν οἱ κατοικοῦντες Γαβαὼν

**Joshua 9**

17 Then the sons of Israel departed, and came unto their cities on the third day; now their
18 cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and the city Jearim. And the sons of Israel fought not against them, because all the rulers of the congregation had sworn unto them by the Lord God of Israel; and all the congregation murmured
19 against the rulers. Then all the rulers said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by the Lord God of Israel,
20 and now we cannot fall upon them. This will we do unto them: we will keep them alive, and will preserve them, and there shall not be
21 wrath upon us because of the oath which we swore unto them. And the rulers said unto them, They shall live, and shall be hewers of wood and drawers of water for all the congregation, even as the rulers spake unto them.
22 And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled me, saying, We are very far from you? when ye are indeed inhabitants
23 of those who dwell among us. And now, cursed shall ye be; there shall never cease from among you a servant, nor a hewer of wood, nor a drawer of water, for me and for my God.
24 And they answered Joshua and said, Because it was certainly told us whatsoever the Lord thy God commanded Moses His servant, to give you all this land, and to utterly destroy us and all the inhabitants thereof from before your face; and we were sore afraid for our lives because of
25 your presence, and we have done this thing. And now, behold, we are in thine hand; whatsoever it pleaseth you and seemeth good unto you to do, even so do unto us.
26 And so did he unto them; for Joshua delivered them that day out of the hand of the sons of Israel, and they did not
27 slay them. And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for all the congregation, and for the altar of God; wherefore the inhabitants of Gibeon became hewers of wood and drawers of water for the altar of God even unto this day, and unto the place which the Lord shall choose.

**Joshua 10**

1 Now it came to pass, when Adonibezek king of Jerusalem had heard that Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it (even as he had done unto Jericho and her king, so had he done unto Ai and her king), and that the inhabitants of Gibeon had defected
