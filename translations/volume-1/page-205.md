#### Original Text (with light OCR corrections)

**6** καὶ διπλῆν οὐ διχηλεῖ, ἀκάθαρτον τοῦτο ὑμῖν· καὶ τὸν χοιρογρύλλιον, ὅτι ἀνάγει μηρυκισμὸν τοῦτο, καὶ διπλῆν οὐ διχηλεῖ, ἀκάθαρτον τοῦτο ὑμῖν·
**7** καὶ τὸν ὖν, ὅτι διχηλεῖ διπλῆν τοῦτο, καὶ ὀνυχίζει ὄνυχας ὁπλῆς, καὶ τοῦτο οὐκ ἀνάγει μηρυκισμὸν, ἀκάθαρτον τοῦτο ὑμῖν.
**8** Ἀπὸ τῶν κρεῶν αὐτῶν οὐ φάγεσθε, καὶ τῶν θνησιμαίων αὐτῶν οὐχ ἅψεσθε, (ὅτι) ἀκάθαρτα ταῦτα ὑμῖν.
**9** Καὶ ταῦτα (ἃ) φάγεσθε ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν ἐν τοῖς ὕδασι· πάντα ὅσα ἐστὶν αὐτοῖς πτερύγια καὶ λεπῖδες ἐν τοῖς ὕδασι, καὶ ἐν ταῖς θαλάσσαις, καὶ ἐν χειμάρροις, ταῦτα φάγεσθε.
**10** Καὶ πάντα ὅσα οὐκ ἔστιν αὐτοῖς πτερύγια οὐδὲ λεπῖδες ἐν τῷ ὕδατι, (ἢ) ἐν ταῖς θαλάσσαις, καὶ ἐν τοῖς χειμάρροις, ἀπὸ πάντων ζῴων ἐρεύγεται τὰ ὕδατα, καὶ ἀπὸ πάσης ψυχῆς ζώσης τῆς ἐν τῷ ὕδατι, βδέλυγμά ἐστι·
**11** καὶ βδελύγματα ἔσονται ὑμῖν· ἀπὸ τῶν κρεῶν αὐτῶν οὐκ ἔδεσθε,
**12** καὶ τὰ θνησιμαῖα αὐτῶν βδελύξεσθε. Καὶ πάντα ὅσα οὐκ ἔστιν αὐτοῖς πτερύγια καὶ λεπῖδες ἐν τῷ ὕδατι, βδέλυγμα τοῦτο ἐστιν ὑμῖν.
**13** Καὶ ταῦτα βδελύξεσθε ἀπὸ τῶν πετεινῶν, καὶ οὐ βρωθήσεται· βδέλυγμά ἐστι· τὸν ἀετὸν, καὶ τὸν γρῦπα, καὶ τὸν ἁλιαίετον,
**14** καὶ τὸν γῦπα, καὶ ἴκτινα, καὶ τὰ ὅμοια αὐτῷ·
**15** καὶ πάντα κόρακα, καὶ ὅμοια αὐτῷ· καὶ στρουθὸν, καὶ γλαῦκα, καὶ λάρον,
**16** καὶ τὰ ὅμοια αὐτῷ· καὶ ἱέρακα, καὶ τὰ ὅμοια αὐτῷ·
**17** καὶ νυκτικόρακα, καὶ καταράκτην, καὶ ἶβιν, καὶ πορφυρίωνα, καὶ πελεκᾶνα,
**18** καὶ κύκνον, (καὶ γλαῦκα), καὶ ἐρωδιὸν, καὶ χαραδριὸν,
**19** καὶ τὰ ὅμοια αὐτῷ· καὶ ἔποπα, καὶ νυκτερίδα· καὶ πάντα τὰ ἑρπετὰ τῶν πετεινῶν, ἃ πορεύεται ἐπὶ τέσσαρα, βδελύγματά ἐστι· ὑμῖν.
**20** Ἀλλὰ ταῦτα φάγεσθε ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν ἑρπετῶν τῶν πετεινῶν ἃ πορεύεται ἐπὶ τέσσαρα, ἃ ἔχει σκέλη ἀνώτερον τῶν ποδῶν αὐτῶν, πηδᾶν ἐν αὐτοῖς ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς· καὶ ταῦτα φάγεσθε ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν·
**21** τὸν βροῦχον, καὶ τὰ ὅμοια αὐτῷ· καὶ τὸν ἀττάκην, καὶ τὰ ὅμοια αὐτῷ·
**22** καὶ τὴν ἀκρίδα, καὶ τὰ ὅμοια αὐτῇ· καὶ τὸν ὀφιμάχην, καὶ τὰ ὅμοια αὐτῷ.
**23** Πᾶν ἑρπετὸν ἀπὸ τῶν πετεινῶν, οἷς εἰσὶ τέσσαρες πόδες, βδελύγματα ὑμῖν ἐστιν,
**24** καὶ ἐν τούτοις μιανθήσεσθε· πᾶς δ᾽ ἁπτόμενος τῶν θνησιμαίων αὐτῶν, ἀκάθαρτος ἔσται ἕως ἑσπέρας·
**25** καὶ πᾶς δ᾽ αἴρων τῶν θνησιμαίων αὐτῶν, πλυνεῖ τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀκάθαρτος ἔσται ἕως ἑσπέρας.
**26** (Καὶ) ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς κτήνεσιν, ἃ ἐστι διχηλοῦν διπλῆν, καὶ ὀνυχίστρας ὀνυχίζει, καὶ μηρυκισμὸν οὐκ ἀναμηρυκᾶται, ἀκάθαρτα ἔ[σονται ὑμῖν].

#### Literary Translation

**6** And the coney, because it doth chew the cud, and the cloven hoof it doth not divide, this [is] unclean unto you.
**7** And the swine, because it divideth the cloven hoof, and hath claws of hoofs, yet it cheweth not the cud, this [is] unclean unto you.
**8** Of their flesh ye shall not eat, and their carcasses shall ye not touch, (for) these [are] unclean unto you.

**9** And these [are they] which ye shall eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, and in the seas, and in the torrents, these ye shall eat.
**10** And whatsoever hath not fins nor scales in the water, (or) in the seas, and in the torrents; [and whatsoever] from all living creatures, the waters belch forth; and from every living soul that is in the water, it is an abomination.
**11** And abominations shall they be unto you; of their flesh ye shall not eat,
**12** and their carcasses ye shall abhor. And all that whatsoever hath not fins and scales in the water, this [is] an abomination unto you.

**13** And these shall ye abhor of the fowls, and they shall not be eaten; they are an abomination: the eagle, and the griffin [vulture], and the osprey,
**14** and the vulture, and the kite, and its like;
**15** and every raven, and its like; and the ostrich, and the owl, and the gull,
**16** and its like; and the hawk, and its like;
**17** and the night raven, and the cormorant, and the ibis, and the purple gallinule, and the pelican,
**18** and the swan, (and the owl), and the heron, and the plover,
**19** and its like; and the hoopoe, and the bat; and all winged creeping things that go upon four [feet, they] are abominations unto you.

**20** But these ye shall eat of all winged creeping things that go upon four [feet], which have legs above their feet, to leap with them upon the earth; and these ye shall eat of them:
**21** the locust, and its like; and the bald locust, and its like;
**22** and the grasshopper, and its like; and the cricket, and its like.
**23** Every creeping thing of the fowls, which hath four feet, [it is] an abomination unto you,
**24** and by these ye shall be defiled: whosoever toucheth their carcasses, he shall be unclean until the evening;
**25** and whosoever beareth their carcasses, he shall wash his clothes, and shall be unclean until the evening.
**26** (And) among all the cattle which is cloven-hoofed, [having] a double division, and hath dividing claws, yet cheweth not the cud, they shall be unclean.
