κιβωτὸν τῆς διαθήκης τοῦ Θεοῦ, περιέφερον ἐν ἑαυτοῖς· καὶ Φι-
νεὲς ἱεράτευσεν ἀντὶ Ἐλεάζαρ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ ἕως ἀπέθανε,
καὶ κατωρύγη ἐν Γαβαὰθ τῇ ἑαυτοῦ. Οἱ δὲ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἀπῆλ-
θον ἕκαστος εἰς τὸν τόπον ἑαυτῶν, καὶ εἰς τὴν ἑαυτῶν πόλιν.
Καὶ ἐξέβοντο οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ τὴν Ἀστάρτην, καὶ τὴν Ἀσταρὼθ,
καὶ τοὺς θεοὺς τῶν ἐθνῶν τῶν κύκλῳ αὐτῶν· καὶ παρέδωκεν αὐ-
τοὺς Κύριος εἰς χεῖρας Ἐγλὼμ τῷ βασιλεῖ Μωάβ, καὶ κατεκυ-
ρίευσεν αὐτῶν ἔτη δεκαοκτώ.
