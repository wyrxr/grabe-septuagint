168 ΕΞΟΔΟΣ ΚΕΦ. ΛΗ´. ΛΘ´.
ἔστησαν παρὰ τὰς θύρας τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου, ἐν ᾗ ἡμέρᾳ
ἔπηξεν αὐτήν· καὶ ἐποίησε τὸν λουτῆρα, ἵνα νίπτωνται ἐξ αὐτοῦ
Μωυσῆς καὶ Ἀαρὼν καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ τὰς χεῖρας καὶ τοὺς πό-
δας αὐτῶν, εἰσπορευομένων αὐτῶν εἰς τὴν σκηνὴν τοῦ μαρτυρίου·
ἢ ὅταν προσπορεύωνται πρὸς τὸ θυσιαστήριον λειτουργεῖν, ἐνίπτον-
το ἐξ αὐτοῦ, καθάπερ συνέταξε Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ.

ΚΕΦ. ΛΘ´. XXXIX.

ΠΑΝ τὸ χρυσίον, ὃ κατειργάσθη εἰς τὰ ἔργα κατὰ πᾶσαν
τὴν ἐργασίαν τῶν ἁγίων, ἐγένετο ἐκ χρυσίου τοῦ τῆς ἀπαρχῆς,
ἐννέα καὶ εἴκοσι τάλαντα, καὶ ἑπτακόσιοι καὶ τριάκοντα σίκλοι,
κατὰ τὸν σίκλον τὸν ἅγιον. Καὶ ἀργυρίου ἀφαίρεμα παρὰ τῶν
ἐπεσκεμμένων ἀνδρῶν τῆς συναγωγῆς ἑκατὸν τάλαντα, καὶ χίλιοι
καὶ ἑπτακόσιοι καὶ ἑβδομηκονταπέντε σίκλοι· δραχμὴ μία τῇ κε-
φαλῇ καὶ τὸ ἥμισυ τοῦ σίκλου, κατὰ τὸν σίκλον τὸν ἅγιον. Πᾶς
ὁ παραπορευόμενος τὴν ἐπίσκεψιν ἀπὸ εἰκοσαετοῦς καὶ ἐπάνω εἰς
τὰς ἑξήκοντα μυριάδας καὶ τρισχιλίους καὶ πεντακοσίους καὶ πεν-
τήκοντα. Καὶ ἐγενήθη τὰ ἑκατὸν τάλαντα τοῦ ἀργυρίου εἰς τὴν
χώνευσιν τῶν κεφαλίδων τῆς σκηνῆς, καὶ εἰς τὰς κεφαλίδας τοῦ
καταπετάσματος, ἑκατὸν κεφαλίδες εἰς τὰ ἑκατὸν τάλαντα, τά-
λαντον ἐν τῇ κεφαλίδι· καὶ τοὺς χιλίους καὶ ἑπτακοσίους καὶ
ἑβδομηκονταπέντε σίκλους ἐποίησεν εἰς τὰς ἀγκύλας τῶν στύλων,
καὶ κατεχρύσωσε τὰς κεφαλίδας αὐτῶν, καὶ κατεκόσμησεν αὐτούς.
Καὶ ὁ χαλκὸς τοῦ ἀφαιρέματος τετρακόσια ἑβδομήκοντα τάλαντα,
καὶ δισχίλιοι καὶ τετρακόσιοι σίκλοι. Καὶ ἐποίησαν ἐξ αὐτοῦ τὰς
βάσεις τῆς θύρας τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου, καὶ τὰς βάσεις τῆς
σκηνῆς κύκλῳ, καὶ τὰς βάσεις τῆς πύλης τῆς αὐλῆς, καὶ τοὺς
πασσάλους τῆς σκηνῆς, καὶ τοὺς πασσάλους τῆς αὐλῆς κύκλῳ,
καὶ τὸ παράθεμα τὸ χαλκοῦν κύκλῳ τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου, καὶ πάντα
τὰ σκεύη τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου, καὶ πάντα τὰ ἐργαλεῖα τῆς σκηνῆς
τοῦ μαρτυρίου. Καὶ ἐποίησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ, καθὰ συνέταξε Κύ-
ριος τῷ Μωυσῇ, οὕτως ἐποίησαν. Τὸ δὲ λοιπὸν χρυσίον τοῦ ἀ-
φαιρέματος ἐποίησαν σκεύη εἰς τὸ λειτουργεῖν ἐν αὐτοῖς ἔναντι
Κυρίου· καὶ τὴν καταλειφθεῖσαν ὑάκινθον, καὶ πορφύραν, καὶ τὸ
κόκκινον, καὶ βύσσον ἐποίησαν στολὰς λειτουργικὰς Ἀαρών, ὥστε

**Chapter 38**
³⁰ [and they] did set [the laver] by the doors of the Tabernacle of Testimony, on the day when he pitched it. ³¹ And he made the laver, that Moses, and Aaron, and his sons might wash their hands and their feet therefrom, when they entered into the Tabernacle of Testimony; or when they drew near unto the altar to minister, they washed themselves therefrom, even as the Lord commanded Moses.

**Chapter 39**
¹ Now all the gold that was wrought for the works, for all the service of the sanctuary, was of the gold of the heave offering, even twenty and nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the holy shekel.
² And the silver of the heave offering, which was from the men that were inspected of the congregation, was a hundred talents, and one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five shekels; a drachma for each head, and half a shekel, after the holy shekel. All those that passed the inspection, from twenty years old and upward, even unto six hundred and three thousand, five hundred and fifty.
³ And the hundred talents of silver were for the casting of the capitals of the Tabernacle, and for the capitals of the veil; one hundred capitals for the hundred talents, a talent for each capital. And the one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five shekels he made into the hooks of the pillars; and he did overlay their capitals with gold, and he did adorn them.
⁴ And the bronze of the heave offering was four hundred and seventy talents, and two thousand and four hundred shekels. And of it they made the bases for the door of the Tabernacle of Testimony, and the bases of the Tabernacle round about, and the bases of the gate of the court, and the pegs of the Tabernacle, and the pegs of the court round about, and the bronze grate for the altar round about, and all the vessels of the altar, and all the instruments of the Tabernacle of Testimony.
⁵ And the sons of Israel did, even as the Lord commanded Moses, so they did. And of the remaining gold of the heave offering they made vessels to minister with them before the Lord; and of the remaining hyacinth, and of the purple, and of the scarlet, and of the fine linen, they made priestly garments for Aaron, that...
