    τῆς θύρας τῆς σκηνῆς. Καὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον τῶν καρπωμάτων 29
    ἔθηκε παρὰ τὰς θύρας τῆς σκηνῆς τῆς σκέπης τοῦ μαρτυρίου, καὶ
    ἀνήνεγκεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῦ τὴν ὁλοκαύτωσιν, καὶ τὴν θυσίαν, καθὰ ἐνε-
    τείλατο Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ. Καὶ ἐποίησε τὸν λουτῆρα ἀναμέσον τῆς 30
    σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου, καὶ ἀναμέσον τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου, καὶ ἔδω-
    κεν ἐκεῖ ὕδωρ, ἵνα νίπτωνται ἐξ αὐτοῦ Μωυσῆς καὶ ᾿Ααρὼν καὶ 31
    οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ τὰς χεῖρας αὑτῶν καὶ τοὺς πόδας, εἰσπορευομένων 32
    αὐτῶν εἰς τὴν σκηνὴν τοῦ μαρτυρίου ἢ ὅταν προσπορεύωνται πρὸς
    τὸ θυσιαστήριον λειτουργεῖν, ἐνίπτοντο ἐξ αὐτοῦ, καθάπερ συνέταξε
    Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ. Καὶ ἔστησε τὴν αὐλὴν κύκλῳ τῆς σκηνῆς καὶ 33
    τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου, καὶ ἔθηκε τὸ ἐπίσπαστρον τῆς αὐλῆς· καὶ συ-
    νετέλεσε Μωυσῆς πάντα τὰ ἔργα. Καὶ ἐκάλυψεν ἡ νεφέλη τὴν 34
    σκηνὴν τοῦ μαρτυρίου, καὶ δόξης Κυρίου ἐπλήσθη ἡ σκηνή· καὶ 35
    οὐκ ἠδυνήθη Μωυσῆς εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὴν σκηνὴν τοῦ μαρτυρίου, ὅτι
    ἐπεσκίαζεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὴν ἡ νεφέλη, καὶ δόξης Κυρίου ἐπλήσθη ἡ
    σκηνή. Ἡνίκα δ᾿ ἂν ἀνέβη ἡ νεφέλη ἀπὸ τῆς σκηνῆς, ἀνεζεύγνυ- 36
    σαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ σὺν τῇ ἀπαρτίᾳ αὑτῶν· εἰ δὲ μὴ ἀνέβη ἡ 37
    νεφέλη, οὐκ ἀνεζεύγνυσαν ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας, ἧς ἀνέβη ἡ νεφέλη.
    Νεφέλη γὰρ Κυρίου ἦν ἐπὶ τῆς σκηνῆς ἡμέρας, καὶ πῦρ ἦν ἐπ᾿ αὐ- 38
    τῆς νυκτὸς ἐναντίον παντὸς Ἰσραὴλ, ἐν πάσαις ταῖς ἀναζυγαῖς αὐτῶν.

    Ἔξοδος τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ ἐξ Αἰγύπτου.

### CHAPTER 40

29 The door of the tabernacle. And he set the altar of the burnt offerings by the doors of the tabernacle of the tent of witness, and he offered upon it the burnt offering and the [other] sacrifice, as the Lord had commanded Moses.

30 And he fashioned the laver betwixt the tabernacle of witness and betwixt the altar, and he poured therein water;

31 that Moses and Aaron and his sons might wash their hands and their feet from it;

32 when they entered into the tabernacle of witness, or when they drew nigh unto the altar to minister, they would wash themselves from it, as the Lord had ordained Moses.

33 And he set up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and he placed the curtain of the court. And Moses finished all the works.

34 And the cloud did cover the tabernacle of witness, and the tabernacle was filled with the glory of the Lord.

35 And Moses was not able to enter into the tabernacle of witness, because the cloud overshadowed it, and the tabernacle was filled with the glory of the Lord.

36 And whenever the cloud went up from the tabernacle, the sons of Israel journeyed forth with their complete array;

37 but if the cloud went not up, they journeyed not forth until the day that the cloud went up.

38 For the cloud of the Lord was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was upon it by night, before all Israel, in all their journeys.
