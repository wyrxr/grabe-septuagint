πρὸς ὑμᾶς. Καὶ ἐρωτήσουσι με· τί ὄνομα αὐτῷ; τί ἐρῶ πρὸς αὐτούς;
14 Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ Θεὸς πρὸς Μωυσῆν· ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ ὤν. Καὶ εἶπεν· οὕτως ἐρεῖς τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ· ὁ ὤν ἀπέσταλκέ με πρὸς
15 ὑμᾶς. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ Θεὸς πάλιν πρὸς Μωυσῆν· οὕτως ἐρεῖς τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ· Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τῶν πατέρων ὑμῶν, Θεὸς Ἀβραάμ, καὶ Θεὸς Ἰσαάκ, καὶ Θεὸς Ἰακὼβ ἀπέσταλκέ με πρὸς ὑμᾶς· τοῦτό μου ἐστὶν ὄνομα αἰώνιον, καὶ μνημόσυνον γενεᾶς γενεῶν.
16 Ἐλθὼν συνάγαγε τὴν γερουσίαν τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτούς· Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τῶν πατέρων ὑμῶν ὤπταί μοι, Θεὸς Ἀβραάμ, καὶ Θεὸς Ἰσαάκ, καὶ Θεὸς Ἰακώβ, λέγων· ἐπισκοπῇ ἐπέσκεμμαι ὑμᾶς, καὶ ὅσα συμβέβηκεν ὑμῖν ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ.
17 Καὶ εἶπα ἀναβιβάσω ὑμᾶς ἐκ τῆς κακώσεως τῶν Αἰγυπτίων εἰς τὴν γῆν τῶν Χαναναίων, καὶ Χετταίων, καὶ Ἀμοῤῥαίων, καὶ Φερεζαίων, καὶ Γεργεσαίων, καὶ Εὐαίων, καὶ Ἰεβουσαίων, εἰς γῆν ῥέουσαν γάλα καὶ μέλι.
18 Καὶ εἰσακούσονταί σου τῆς φωνῆς, καὶ εἰσελεύση σὺ καὶ ἡ γερουσία Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς Φαραὼ βασιλέα Αἰγύπτου, καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτόν· Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τῶν Ἑβραίων προσκέκληται ἡμᾶς· πορευσόμεθα οὖν ὁδὸν τριῶν ἡμερῶν εἰς τὴν ἔρημον, ἵνα θύσωμεν Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ ἡμῶν.
19 Ἐγὼ δὲ οἶδα, ὅτι οὐ προήσεται ὑμᾶς Φαραὼ βασιλεὺς Αἰγύπτου πορευθῆναι, ἐὰν μὴ μετὰ χειρὸς κραταιᾶς.
20 Καὶ ἐκτείνας τὴν χεῖρά μου, πατάξω τοὺς Αἰγυπτίους ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς θαυμασίοις μου, οἷς ποιήσω ἐν αὐτοῖς· καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα ἐξαποστελεῖ ὑμᾶς.
21 Καὶ δώσω χάριν τῷ λαῷ τούτῳ ἐναντίον τῶν Αἰγυπτίων·
22 ὅταν δὲ ἀποτρέχητε, οὐκ ἀπελεύσεσθε κενοί· ἀλλὰ αἰτήσει γυνὴ παρὰ γείτονος καὶ συσκήνου αὐτῆς σκεύη ἀργυρᾶ καὶ χρυσᾶ, καὶ ἱματισμόν, καὶ ἐπιθήσετε ἐπὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς ὑμῶν καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς θυγατέρας ὑμῶν, καὶ συσκευάσετε τοὺς Αἰγυπτίους.

1 ἈΠΕΚΡΙΘΗ δὲ Μωυσῆς, καὶ εἶπεν· ἐὰν οὖν μὴ πιστεύσωσί μοι, μηδὲ εἰσακούσωσι τῆς φωνῆς μου· ἐροῦσι γάρ, ὅτι οὐκ ὤπταί σοι Κύριος ὁ Θεός, τί ἐρῶ πρὸς αὐτούς;
2 Εἶπε δὲ αὐτῷ Κύριος· τί τοῦτό ἐστι τὸ ἐν τῇ χειρί σου; Ὁ δὲ εἶπε· ῥάβδος.
3 Καὶ εἶπε· ῥῖψον αὐτὴν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν. Καὶ ἐῤῥίψεν αὐτὴν ἐπὶ τὴν 4 γῆν, καὶ ἐγένετο ὄφις· καὶ ἔφυγε Μωυσῆς ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ.

**EXODUS CHAPTER THREE**

13 And they shall ask me, "What is His Name?" What shall I say unto them?
14 And God said unto Moses, "I AM HE WHO IS." And He said, "Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel: 'He Who Is hath sent me unto you.'"
15 And God said again unto Moses, "Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel: 'The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you:' this is My Name for ever, and My memorial unto generations of generations.
16 Go and gather the elders of the children of Israel, and thou shalt say unto them, 'The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto me, saying: I have surely visited you, and [seen] all that hath befallen you in Egypt.
17 And I said, "I will bring you up out of the affliction of the Egyptians unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey."
18 And they shall hearken unto thy voice: and thou, and the elders of Israel, shall come unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, 'The LORD God of the Hebrews hath summoned us; we will go, therefore, a three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God.'
19 And I know that Pharaoh, king of Egypt, will not suffer you to go, save by a mighty hand.
20 And I will stretch forth My hand, and will smite the Egyptians with all My wonders, which I shall do among them: and after these things, he shall send you forth.
21 And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians:
22 And it shall be, when ye depart, ye shall not go forth empty: but every woman shall ask of her neighbour, and of her that dwelleth with her in the house, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall despoil the Egyptians."

**CHAPTER FOUR**

1 And Moses answered and said, "But if they will not believe me, neither hearken unto my voice; for they will say, 'The LORD God hath not appeared unto thee;' what shall I say unto them?"
2 And the LORD said unto him, "What is this in thy hand?" And he said, "A rod."
3 And He said, "Cast it upon the ground." And he cast it upon the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from it.
