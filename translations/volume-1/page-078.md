ΚΕΦ. ΛΕ΄.                 ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ
καὶ καθαρίσασθε, καὶ ἀλλάξατε τὰς στολὰς ὑμῶν· καὶ ἀναστάντες 3
ἀναβῶμεν εἰς Βαιθήλ, καὶ ποιήσωμεν ἐκεῖ θυσιαστήριον τῷ Θεῷ
τῷ ἐπακούσαντί μου ἐν ἡμέρᾳ θλίψεως, ὃς ἦν μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ, καὶ διέ-
σωσέ με ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ, ᾗ ἐπορευόμην. Καὶ ἔδωκαν τῷ Ἰακὼβ τοὺς 4
θεοὺς τοὺς ἀλλοτρίους οἳ ἦσαν ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰ ἐ-
νώτια τὰ ἐν τοῖς ὠσὶν αὐτῶν· καὶ κατέκρυψεν αὐτὰ Ἰακὼβ ὑπὸ
τὴν τερέβινθον τὴν ἐν Σικίμοις, καὶ ἀπώλεσεν αὐτά, ἕως τῆς σή-
μερον ἡμέρας. Καὶ ἐξῆρεν Ἰσραὴλ ἐκ Σικίμων· καὶ ἐγένετο φόβος 5
Θεοῦ ἐπὶ τὰς πόλεις τὰς κύκλῳ αὐτῶν, καὶ οὐ κατεδίωξαν ὀπί-
σω τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ. Ἦλθε δὲ Ἰακὼβ εἰς Λουζὰ ἥ ἐστιν ἐν γῇ 6
Χαναάν, ἤ ἐστι Βαιθήλ, αὐτὸς καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαός, ὃς ἦν μετ᾿ αὐ-
τοῦ. Καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν ἐκεῖ θυσιαστήριον, καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸ ὄνομα 7
τοῦ τόπου Ἰσχυρὸς Βαιθήλ· ἐκεῖ γὰρ ἐπεφάνη αὐτῷ ὁ Θεός, ἐν
τῷ ἀποδιδράσκειν αὐτὸν ἀπὸ προσώπου Ἠσαῦ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ.
Ἀπέθανε δὲ Δεββώρα ἡ τροφὸς Ῥεβέκκας, καὶ ἐτάφη κατώτερον 8
Βαιθὴλ ὑπὸ τὴν βάλανον· καὶ ἐκάλεσεν (Ἰακὼβ) τὸ ὄνομα αὐ-
τῆς, Βάλανος πένθους. Ὤφθη δὲ ὁ Θεὸς Ἰακὼβ ἔτι ἐν Λουζᾷ, ὅτε 9
παρεγένετο ἐκ Μεσοποταμίας τῆς Συρίας, καὶ ηὐλόγησεν αὐτὸν ὁ
Θεός. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ Θεός· τὸ ὄνομά σου Ἰακὼβ οὐ κληθήσε-
ται ἔτι Ἰακώβ, ἀλλ᾿ Ἰσραὴλ ἔσται τὸ ὄνομά σου· καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸ 10
ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ἰσραήλ. Εἶπε δὲ αὐτῷ ὁ Θεός· ἐγὼ ὁ Θεός σου 11
ἱκανός· αὔξανου, καὶ πληθύνου· (καὶ) ἔθνη καὶ συναγωγαὶ ἐθνῶν
ἔσονται ἐκ σοῦ, καὶ βασιλεῖς ἐκ τῆς ὀσφύος σου ἐξελεύσονται·
καὶ τὴν γῆν, ἣν δέδωκα Ἀβραὰμ καὶ Ἰσαάκ, σοὶ δέδωκα αὐτήν, 12
σοὶ ἔσται· καὶ τῷ σπέρματί σου μετὰ σὲ δώσω τὴν γῆν ταύτην.
Ἀνέβη δὲ ὁ Θεὸς ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἐκ τοῦ τόπου, οὗ ἐλάλησε μετ᾿ αὐ- 13
τοῦ. Καὶ ἔστησεν Ἰακὼβ στήλην ἐν τῷ τόπῳ, ᾧ ἐλάλησε μετ᾿ αὐ- 14
τοῦ, στήλην λιθίνην· καὶ ἔσπεισεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὴν σπονδήν, καὶ ἐπέχεεν
ἐπ᾿ αὐτὴν ἔλαιον. Καὶ ἐκάλεσεν Ἰακὼβ τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ τόπου, ἐν 15
ᾧ ἐλάλησε μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἐκεῖ ὁ Θεός, Βαιθήλ. Ἀπῆρε δὲ (Ἰακὼβ) 16
ἐκ Βαιθήλ, (ἔπηξε τὴν σκηνὴν αὐτοῦ ἐπέκεινα τοῦ πύργου Γαδὲρ)
ἐγένετο δὲ ἡνίκα ἤγγισε Χαβραθὰ εἰς γῆν ἐλθεῖν Ἐφραθᾶ, ἔτεκε
Ῥαχήλ, καὶ ἐδυστόκησεν ἐν τῷ τοκετῷ. Ἐγένετο δὲ ἐν τῷ σπλη- 17
ρῶς αὐτὴν τίκτειν, εἶπεν αὐτῇ ἡ μαῖα· θάρσει, καὶ γὰρ οὗτός σοι
ἐστιν υἱός. Ἐγένετο δὲ ἐν τῷ ἀφιέναι αὐτὴν τὴν ψυχήν, (ἀπέθνη- 18
σκε γάρ) ἐκάλεσε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ, υἱὸς ὀδύνης μου· ὁ δὲ πατὴρ

**Chapter 35**
3 And purify yourselves, and change your garments. And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and let us make there an altar unto God, who heard me in the day of my distress, and was with me, and delivered me in the way which I went.
4 And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the terebinth which was in Shechem, and destroyed them even unto this day.
5 And Israel journeyed from Shechem: and the fear of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Israel.
6 And Jacob came unto Luzah, which is in the land of Canaan, or it is Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.
7 And he built there an altar, and called the name of the place, Strong Bethel; for there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of Esau his brother.
8 And Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under the oak; and (Jacob) called the name thereof, the Oak of Mourning.
9 And God appeared unto Jacob yet again in Luzah, when he came out of Mesopotamia of Syria, and God blessed him.
10 And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob; it shall not be called Jacob any more, but Israel shall be thy name: and He called his name Israel.
11 And God said unto him, I am thy God Almighty: increase, and multiply; (and) nations and companies of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come forth from thy loins;
12 And the land which I gave unto Abraham and Isaac, unto thee have I given it; it shall be thine; and to thy seed after thee will I give this land.
13 And God went up from him from the place where He spake with him.
14 And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where He spake with him, even a pillar of stone; and he poured thereon a drink offering, and he poured thereon oil.
15 And Jacob called the name of the place, where God spake with him there, Bethel.
16 And (Jacob) journeyed from Bethel, (he pitched his tent beyond the tower of Gadar); and it came to pass, when he drew nigh unto Chabratah to come into the land of Ephrath, Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.
17 And it came to pass, when she was hardly bearing, the midwife said unto her, Be of good cheer, for this is a son for thee.
18 And it came to pass, as her soul was departing (for she was dying), that she called his name, Son of My Sorrow; but his father
