τὴν γῆν ταύτην, καὶ ἐνευλογηθήσονται ἐν τῷ σπέρματί σου πάντα
τὰ ἔθνη τῆς γῆς· ἀνθ’ ὧν ὑπήκουσεν Ἀβραὰμ ὁ πατήρ σου τῆς 5
ἐμῆς φωνῆς, καὶ ἐφύλαξε τὰ προστάγματά μου, καὶ τὰς ἐντολάς
μου, καὶ τὰ δικαιώματά μου, καὶ τὰ νόμιμά μου. Καὶ κατώ- 6
κησεν Ἰσαὰκ ἐν Γεράροις. Ἐπηρώτησαν δὲ οἱ ἄνδρες τοῦ τόπου 7
περὶ Ῥεβέκκας τῆς γυναικὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπεν, (ὅτι) ἀδελφή μου
ἐστίν· ἐφοβήθη γὰρ εἰπεῖν, (ὅτι) γυνή μου ἐστί, μή ποτε ἀποκτεί-
νωσιν αὐτὸν οἱ ἄνδρες τοῦ τόπου περὶ Ῥεβέκκας, ὅτι ὡραία τῇ
ὄψει ἦν. Ἐγένετο δὲ πολυχρόνιος ἐκεῖ· παρακύψας δὲ Ἀβιμέλεχ 8
ὁ βασιλεὺς Γεράρων διὰ τῆς θυρίδος, ἴδε τὸν Ἰσαὰκ παίζοντα
μετὰ Ῥεβέκκας τῆς γυναικὸς αὐτοῦ. Ἐκάλεσε δὲ Ἀβιμέλεχ τὸν 9
Ἰσαάκ, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· ἆρά γε γυνή σου ἐστί· τί ὅτι εἴπας, ἀ-
δελφή μου ἐστίν; Εἶπε δὲ αὐτῷ Ἰσαάκ· εἶπα γάρ, μή ποτε ἀπο-
θάνω δι’ αὐτήν. Εἶπε δὲ αὐτῷ Ἀβιμέλεχ· τί τοῦτο ἐποίησας ἡμῖν; 10
μικροῦ ἐκοιμήθη τις τοῦ γένους μου μετὰ τῆς γυναικός σου, καὶ
ἐπήγαγες ἐφ’ ἡμᾶς ἄγνοιαν. Συνέταξε δὲ Ἀβιμέλεχ παντὶ τῷ 11
λαῷ αὐτοῦ, λέγων· πᾶς ὁ ἁπτόμενος τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τούτου ἢ τῆς
γυναικὸς αὐτοῦ, θανάτου ἔνοχος ἔσται. Ἔσπειρε δὲ Ἰσαὰκ ἐν τῇ 12
γῇ ἐκείνῃ, καὶ εὗρεν ἐν τῷ ἐνιαυτῷ ἐκείνῳ ἑκατοστεύουσαν κρι-
θήν· εὐλόγησε δὲ αὐτὸν Κύριος. Καὶ ὑψώθη ὁ ἄνθρωπος, καὶ προ- 13
βαίνων, μεῖζον ἐγίνετο, ἕως οὗ μέγας ἐγένετο σφόδρα. Ἐγένετο 14
δὲ αὐτῷ κτήνη προβάτων, καὶ κτήνη βοῶν, καὶ γεώργια πολλά·
ἐζήλωσαν δὲ αὐτὸν οἱ Φυλιστιείμ. Καὶ πάντα τὰ φρέατα, ἃ ὤρυ- 15
ξαν οἱ παῖδες τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ χρόνῳ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ,
ἐνέφραξαν αὐτὰ οἱ Φυλιστιείμ, καὶ ἔπλησαν αὐτὰ γῆς. Εἶπε δὲ 16
Ἀβιμέλεχ πρὸς Ἰσαάκ· ἄπελθε ἀφ’ ἡμῶν, ὅτι δυνατώτερος ἡμῶν
ἐγένου σφόδρα. Καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ἐκεῖθεν Ἰσαάκ, καὶ κατέλυσεν ἐν τῇ 17
φάραγγι Γεράρων, καὶ κατώκησεν ἐκεῖ. Καὶ πάλιν Ἰσαὰκ ὤρυξε 18
τὰ φρέατα τοῦ ὕδατος, ἃ ὤρυξαν οἱ παῖδες Ἀβραὰμ τοῦ πατρὸς
αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐνέφραξαν αὐτὰ οἱ Φυλιστιείμ μετὰ τὸ ἀποθανεῖν Ἀ-
βραὰμ τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐπωνόμασεν αὐτοῖς ὀνόματα κατὰ
τὰ ὀνόματα, ἃ ὠνόμασεν Ἀβραὰμ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ. Ὤρυξαν δὲ οἱ 19
παῖδες Ἰσαὰκ ἐν τῇ φάραγγι Γεράρων, καὶ εὗρον ἐκεῖ φρέαρ ὕδα-
τος ζῶντος. Καὶ ἐμαχέσαντο οἱ ποιμένες Γεράρων μετὰ τῶν ποι- 20
μένων Ἰσαάκ, φάσκοντες αὐτῶν εἶναι τὸ ὕδωρ· καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸ
ὄνομα τοῦ φρέατος (ἐκείνου), Ἀδικία· ἠδίκησαν γὰρ αὐτόν. Ἀπάρας 21

**CHAPTER 26**

4 this land, and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because that Abraham thy father obeyed My voice, and kept My precepts, and My commandments, and My statutes, and My laws.
5 And Isaac dwelt in Gerar.

6 And the men of the place asked concerning Rebekah, his wife, and he said, (that) She is my sister; for he feared to say, (that) She is my wife, lest peradventure the men of the place should slay him because of Rebekah, for she was beautiful to behold.
7 And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech the king of Gerar, looking forth through a window, saw Isaac sporting with Rebekah his wife.
8 Then Abimelech called Isaac, and said unto him, Verily, she is thy wife: wherefore saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, I said it, lest peradventure I should die for her sake.
9 And Abimelech said, What is this that thou hast done unto us? Scarcely had one of my people lain with thy wife, and thou hadst brought ignorance upon us.
10 And Abimelech commanded all his people, saying, Whosoever toucheth this man or his wife, he shall surely be put to death.

11 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and found in that same year a hundredfold [yield of] barley; and the Lord blessed him.
12 And the man grew mighty, and advancing, he became greater, until he was exceeding great.
13 For he had possessions of sheep, and possessions of oxen, and many fields [for cultivation]; and the Philistines envied him.

14 And all the wells which the servants of his father had dug in the time of his father, the Philistines stopped them, and filled them with earth.
15 And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Depart from us; for thou art become much mightier than we.
16 And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.
17 And again Isaac dug the wells of water, which the servants of Abraham his father had dug; and the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham his father; and he called their names according to the names by which Abraham his father had called them.
18 And the servants of Isaac dug in the valley of Gerar, and found there a well of living water.
19 And the herdsmen of Gerar strove with the herdsmen of Isaac, saying that the water was theirs; and he called the name of the well (that one), Injustice; for they dealt unjustly with him.
20 And [Isaac] removed from thence,
