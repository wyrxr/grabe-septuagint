ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ ΚΕΦ. Α´.
14 μέρα τρίτη. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ Θεός· γενηθήτωσαν φωστῆρες ἐν τῷ στερεώματι τοῦ οὐρανοῦ εἰς φᾶσιν τῆς γῆς, (καὶ ἄρχειν τῆς ἡμέρας καὶ τῆς νυκτός,) καὶ διαχωρίζειν ἀνὰ μέσον τῆς ἡμέρας καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον τῆς νυκτός· καὶ ἔστωσαν εἰς σημεῖα, καὶ εἰς καιρούς, καὶ εἰς
15 ἡμέρας, καὶ εἰς ἐνιαυτούς. Καὶ ἔστωσαν εἰς φᾶσιν ἐν τῷ στερεώματι τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, ὥστε φαίνειν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς· καὶ ἐγένετο οὕτως.
16 Καὶ ἐποίησεν ὁ Θεὸς τοὺς δύο φωστήρας τοὺς μεγάλους· τὸν φωστήρα τὸν μέγαν εἰς ἀρχὰς τῆς ἡμέρας, καὶ τὸν φωστήρα τὸν ἐλάσσω εἰς ἀρχὰς τῆς νυκτός, καὶ τοὺς ἀστέρας.
17 Καὶ ἔθετο αὐτοὺς ὁ Θεὸς ἐν τῷ στερεώματι τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, ὥστε φαίνειν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς,
18 καὶ ἄρχειν τῆς ἡμέρας καὶ τῆς νυκτός, καὶ διαχωρίζειν ἀνὰ μέσον τοῦ φωτὸς καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον τοῦ σκότους· καὶ ἴδεν ὁ Θεός, ὅτι καλόν.
19 Καὶ ἐγένετο ἑσπέρα, καὶ ἐγένετο πρωΐ, ἡμέρα τετάρτη.
20 Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ Θεός· ἐξαγαγέτω τὰ ὕδατα ἑρπετὰ ψυχῶν ζωσῶν, καὶ πετεινὰ πετόμενα ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς κατὰ τὸ στερέωμα τοῦ οὐρανοῦ· καὶ ἐγένετο οὕτως.
21 Καὶ ἐποίησεν ὁ Θεὸς τὰ κήτη τὰ μεγάλα, καὶ πᾶσαν ψυχὴν ζώων ἑρπετῶν, ἃ ἐξήγαγε τὰ ὕδατα κατὰ γένη αὐτῶν, καὶ πᾶν πετεινὸν πτερωτὸν κατὰ γένος· καὶ ἴδεν ὁ Θεός, ὅτι καλά.
22 Καὶ ηὐλόγησεν αὐτὰ ὁ Θεός, λέγων· αὐξάνεσθε, καὶ πληθύνεσθε, καὶ πληρώσατε τὰ ὕδατα ἐν ταῖς θαλάσσαις· καὶ τὰ πετεινὰ πληθυνέσθωσαν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς.
23 Καὶ ἐγένετο ἑσπέρα, καὶ ἐγένετο πρωΐ, ἡμέρα πέμπτη.
24 Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ Θεός· ἐξαγαγέτω ἡ γῆ ψυχὴν ζῶσαν κατὰ γένος, τετράποδα καὶ ἑρπετὰ καὶ θηρία τῆς γῆς κατὰ γένος· καὶ ἐγένετο οὕτως.
25 Καὶ ἐποίησεν ὁ Θεὸς τὰ θηρία τῆς γῆς κατὰ γένος, καὶ τὰ κτήνη κατὰ γένος, καὶ πάντα τὰ ἑρπετὰ τῆς γῆς κατὰ γένος αὐτῶν· καὶ ἴδεν ὁ Θεός, ὅτι καλά.
26 Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ Θεός· ποιήσωμεν ἄνθρωπον κατ᾽ εἰκόνα ἡμετέραν καὶ καθ᾽ ὁμοίωσιν· καὶ ἀρχέτωσαν τῶν ἰχθύων τῆς θαλάσσης, καὶ τῶν πετεινῶν τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ τῶν κτηνῶν, καὶ πάσης τῆς γῆς, καὶ πάντων τῶν ἑρπετῶν τῶν ἑρπόντων ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς.
27 Καὶ ἐποίησεν ὁ Θεὸς τὸν ἄνθρωπον, κατ᾽ εἰκόνα Θεοῦ ἐποίησεν αὐτόν· ἄρσεν καὶ θῆλυ ἐποίησεν αὐτούς.
28 Καὶ ηὐλόγησεν αὐτοὺς ὁ Θεός, λέγων· αὐξάνεσθε καὶ πληθύνεσθε, καὶ πληρώσατε τὴν γῆν, καὶ κατακυριεύσατε αὐτῆς, καὶ ἄρχετε τῶν ἰχθύων τῆς θαλάσσης, καὶ τῶν πετεινῶν τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ πάντων τῶν κτηνῶν, καὶ πάσης τῆς γῆς, καὶ πάντων τῶν ἑρπετῶν τῶν ἑρπόντων ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς.
29 Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ Θεός· Ἰδοὺ δέδωκα ὑμῖν πάντα χόρτον σπέρ-

### Genesis, Chapter 1

**14** *The third day.* And God said, "Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, (and to rule the day and the night,) and to divide between the day and between the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and for years."
**15** And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to shine upon the earth: and it was so.
**16** And God made two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: and the stars also.
**17** And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to shine upon the earth,
**18** and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide between the light and between the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
**19** And there was evening, and there was morning, the fourth day.

**20** And God said, "Let the waters bring forth abundantly moving creatures, [even] living souls; and fowl that may fly upon the earth, over against the firmament of heaven:" and it was so.
**21** And God created the great sea-monsters, and every living soul of moving creatures, which the waters brought forth after their kind; and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that they were good.
**22** And God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let the fowl multiply upon the earth."
**23** And there was evening, and there was morning, the fifth day.

**24** And God said, "Let the earth bring forth living souls after their kind: four-footed beasts, and creeping things, and wild beasts of the earth after their kind:" and it was so.
**25** And God made the wild beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and all the creeping things of the earth after their kind: and God saw that they were good.

**26** And God said, "Let Us make man after Our image and after Our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heaven, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over all the creeping things that creep upon the earth."
**27** So God made man after His image, after the image of God made He him; male and female made He them.
**28** And God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heaven, and over all the cattle, and over all the earth, and over all the creeping things that creep upon the earth."
**29** And God said, "Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed,
