4 δυνάστας Φαραώ, λέγων· εἴ εὗρον χάριν ἐναντίον ὑμῶν, λαλήσατε
5 (περὶ ἐμοῦ) εἰς τὰ ὦτα Φαραώ, λέγοντες· ὁ πατὴρ μου ὥρκισέ με
6 πρὸ τοῦ τελευτῆσαι, λέγων· ἐν τῷ μνημείῳ, ᾧ ὤρυξα ἐμαυτῷ ἐν γῇ
  Χαναάν, ἐκεῖ με θάψεις. Νῦν οὖν ἀναβάς, θάψω τὸν πατέρα μου,
7 καὶ ἐπανελεύσομαι. Καὶ εἶπε Φαραὼ τῷ Ἰωσήφ· ἀνάβηθι, θάψον τὸν
  πατέρα σου, καθάπερ ὥρκισέ σε. Καὶ ἀνέβη Ἰωσὴφ θάψαι τὸν πα-
8 τέρα αὐτοῦ· καὶ συναναβῆσαν μετ’ αὐτοῦ πάντες οἱ παῖδες Φαραώ,
  καὶ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντες οἱ πρεσβύτεροι γῆς Αἰ-
9 γύπτου, καὶ πᾶσα ἡ πανοικία Ἰωσήφ, καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ πᾶσα ἡ
  οἰκία ἡ πατρικὴ αὐτοῦ· καὶ τὴν συγγένειαν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰ πρόβατα, καὶ
10 τοὺς βόας ὑπελίποντο ἐν γῇ Γεσέν· καὶ συναπέβησαν μετ’ αὐτοῦ καὶ
11 ἅρματα καὶ ἱππεῖς, καὶ ἐγένετο ἡ παρεμβολὴ μεγάλη σφόδρα. Καὶ
  παρεγένοντο ἐφ’ ἄλωνα Ἀτάδ, ὅ ἐστι πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου, καὶ
  ἐκόψαντο αὐτοῦ κοπετὸν μέγαν καὶ ἰσχυρὸν σφόδρα· καὶ ἐποίησε
  τὸ πένθος τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας. Καὶ ἴδον οἱ κάτοικοι τῆς
  γῆς Χαναὰν τὸ πένθος ἐν ἄλωνι Ἀτάδ, καὶ εἶπαν· πένθος μέγα
  ἐστι τοῦτο τοῖς Αἰγυπτίοις· διὰ τοῦτο ἐκάλεσε τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ τό-
12 που ἐκείνου, Πένθος Αἰγύπτου, ὅ ἐστι πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου. Καὶ
  ἐποίησαν αὐτῷ οὕτως οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ, καθὼς ἐνετεείλατο αὐτοῖς. Καὶ
13 ἀνέλαβον αὐτὸν οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ εἰς γῆν Χαναάν, καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν εἰς τὸ
  σπήλαιον τὸ διπλοῦν, ὅ ἐκτήσατο Ἀβραὰμ τὸ σπήλαιον ἐν κτήσει μνη-
14 μείου παρὰ Ἔφρων τοῦ Χετταίου, κατέναντι Μαμβρῆ. Καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν
  Ἰωσὴφ εἰς Αἴγυπτον, αὐτὸς καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ οἱ συναναβάντες
15 πάντες θάψαι τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ, μετὰ τὸ θάψαι τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ. Ἴδον-
  τες δὲ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ Ἰωσὴφ ὅτι τέθνηκεν ὁ πατὴρ αὐτῶν, εἶπαν· μὴ
  ποτε μνησικακήσῃ ἡμῖν Ἰωσήφ, καὶ ἀνταπόδομα ἀνταποδῷ ἡμῖν
16 πάντα τὰ κακά, ἃ ἐνεδειξάμεθα αὐτῷ. Καὶ παραγενόμενοι πρὸς
  Ἰωσήφ, εἶπαν· ὁ πατὴρ σου ὥρκισε πρὸ τοῦ τελευτῆσαι αὐτόν,
17 λέγων· οὕτως εἴπατε Ἰωσήφ· ἄφες αὐτοῖς τὴν ἀδικίαν καὶ τὴν ἀ-
  μαρτίαν αὐτῶν, ὅτι πονηρά σοι ἐνεδειξάντο· καὶ νῦν δέξαι τὴν ἀδι-
18 κίαν τῶν θεραπόντων τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ πατρός σου. Καὶ ἔκλαυσεν
  Ἰωσὴφ λαλούντων αὐτῶν πρὸς αὐτόν. Καὶ ἐλθόντες πρὸς αὐτόν,
19 εἶπον· ἰδοὺ ἡμεῖς σοὶ οἰκέται. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς Ἰωσήφ· μὴ φο-
20 βεῖσθε· τοῦ γὰρ Θεοῦ εἰμι ἐγώ. Ὑμεῖς ἐβουλεύσασθε κατ’ ἐμοῦ
  εἰς πονηρά, ὁ δὲ Θεὸς ἐβουλεύσατο περὶ ἐμοῦ εἰς ἀγαθά, ὅπως
21 ἂν γενηθῇ ὡς σήμερον, ἵνα διατραφῇ λαὸς πολύς. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐ-

**Chapter 50**

4 to the chief men of Pharaoh, saying: "If I have found favor in your sight, speak,
5 I pray you, [of me] into the ears of Pharaoh, saying: 'My father made me swear
6 before he died, saying: "In the tomb which I dug for myself in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me." Now therefore, I will go up, and bury my father,
7 and I shall return.'" And Pharaoh said unto Joseph: "Go up, and bury thy father, as he hath made thee swear." And Joseph went up to bury his fa-
8 ther. And there went up with him all the servants of Pharaoh, and the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of E-
9 gypt; and all the household of Joseph, and his brethren, and all his father's house. And their kindred, and their sheep, and
10 their oxen, they left in the land of Goshen. And there went along with him both
11 chariots and horsemen; and the company was very great. And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and
   there they mourned with a great and exceedingly mighty lamentation; and he kept mourning for his father seven days. And when the inhabitants of the
   land of Canaan saw the mourning in the threshingfloor of Atad, they said, "This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians." Therefore he called the name of the pla-
12 ce, The Mourning of Egypt, which is beyond Jordan. And
   his sons did unto him according to that which he had commanded them. And
13 his sons carried him up into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the double cave, which Abraham bought, even the cave, for a possession of a burying-
14 place from Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre. And Joseph returned
   into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all they that went up with him
15 to bury his father, after he had buried his father. Now when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, "Peradventure
   Joseph will bear ill will toward us, and will certainly recompense unto us
16 all the evil which we did unto him." And they came unto
   Joseph, and said, "Thy father did charge before he died,
17 saying: 'Thus shall ye say unto Joseph: "Forgive them their iniquity and their
   sin, for evil did they unto thee; and now, receive thou the ini-
18 quity of the servants of the God of thy father."'" And Joseph wept when they spake unto him. And they came unto him,
19 and said, "Behold, we are thy servants." And Joseph said unto them, "Fear
20 not: for I am God's. Ye devised evil against me;
   but God devised good concerning me, in order that
21 it might come to pass, as it is this day, to make a numerous people to be sustained." And he said un-
