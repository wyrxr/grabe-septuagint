    ΚΕΦ. ΙΔʹ.
    τρώσεις πᾶν τὸ γέννημα τοῦ σπέρματός σου, τὸ γέννημα τοῦ ἀγροῦ σου ἐνιαυτὸν κατ᾿ ἐνιαυτόν·
    23 καὶ φαγῇ αὐτὸ ἔναντι Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ σου ἐν τόπῳ ᾧ ἂν ἐκλέξηται Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου, ἐπικληθῆναι τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ ἐκεῖ, οἴσεις τὰ ἐπιδέκατα τοῦ σίτου σου, καὶ τοῦ οἴνου σου, καὶ τοῦ ἐλαίου σου, καὶ τὰ πρωτότοκα τῶν βοῶν σου, καὶ τῶν προβάτων σου, ἵνα μάθῃς φοβεῖσθαι Κύριον τὸν Θεόν σου πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας.
    24 Ἐὰν δὲ μακρὰν γένηται ἡ ὁδὸς ἀπὸ σοῦ, καὶ μὴ δύνη ἀναφέρειν αὐτά, ὅτι μακρὰν ἀπὸ σοῦ ὁ τόπος ὃν ἂν ἐκλέξηται Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου, ἐπικληθῆναι τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ ἐκεῖ, ὅτι εὐλογήσει σε Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου,
    25 καὶ ἀποδώσῃ αὐτὰ ἀργυρίου, καὶ λήψῃ τὸ ἀργύριον ἐν ταῖς χερσί σου, καὶ πορεύσῃ εἰς τὸν τόπον ὃν ἂν ἐκλέξηται Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου αὐτόν·
    26 καὶ δώσεις τὸ ἀργύριον ἐπὶ παντὸς οὗ ἐὰν ἐπιθυμῇ ἡ ψυχή σου, ἐπὶ βουσίν ἢ ἐπὶ προβάτοις, ἐπὶ οἴνῳ ἢ ἐπὶ σίκερα, ἢ ἐπὶ παντὸς οὗ ἐὰν ἐπιθυμῇ ἡ ψυχή σου, καὶ φαγῇ ἐκεῖ ἔναντι Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ σου, καὶ εὐφρανθήσῃ σὺ καὶ ὁ οἶκός σου,
    27 καὶ ὁ Λευίτης ὁ ἐν ταῖς πόλεσί σου· οὐκ ἐγκαταλείψεις αὐτόν, ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν αὐτῷ μερὶς οὐδὲ κλῆρος μετὰ σοῦ.
    28 Μετὰ τρία ἔτη ἐξοίσεις πᾶν τὸ ἐπιδέκατον τῶν γεννημάτων σου ἐν τῷ ἐνιαυτῷ ἐκείνῳ, καὶ θήσεις αὐτὸ ἐν ταῖς πόλεσί σου·
    29 καὶ ἐλεύσεται ὁ Λευίτης, ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν αὐτῷ μερὶς οὐδὲ κλῆρος μετὰ σοῦ, καὶ ὁ προσήλυτος καὶ ὁ ὀρφανὸς καὶ ἡ χήρα ἡ ἐν ταῖς πόλεσί σου, καὶ φάγονται καὶ ἐμπλησθήσονται, ἵνα εὐλογήσῃ σε Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς ἔργοις τῶν χειρῶν σου οἷς ἐὰν ποιῇς.

    ΚΕΦ. ΙΕʹ.
    1 Δι᾿ ἑπτὰ ἐτῶν ποιήσεις ἄφεσιν.
    2 Καὶ οὕτως τὸ πρόσταγμα τῆς ἀφέσεως· ἀφήσεις πᾶν χρέος ἴδιον, ὃ ὀφείλει σοι ὁ πλησίον σου, τὸν πλησίον σου καὶ τὸν ἀδελφόν σου οὐκ ἀπαιτήσεις, ὅτι ἐπικέκληται ἄφεσις Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ σου.
    3 Τὸν ἀλλότριον ἀπαιτήσεις ὅσα ἐὰν ᾖ σοι παρ᾿ αὐτῷ· τῷ δὲ ἀδελφῷ σου ἄφεσιν ποιήσεις τοῦ χρέους σου.
    4 Ὅτι οὐκ ἔσται ἐν σοὶ ἐνδεής· ὅτι εὐλογῶν εὐλογήσει σε Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου ἐν τῇ γῇ, ᾗ Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου δίδωσί σοι ἐν κλήρῳ κατακληρονομῆσαι αὐτήν.
    5 Ἐὰν δὲ ἀκοῇ εἰσακούσῃς τῆς φωνῆς Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ὑμῶν φυλάσσειν καὶ ποιεῖν

    **Chapter 14**
    Thou shalt surely eat all the produce of thy seed, the produce of thy field, year by year;
    23 and thou shalt eat it before the LORD thy God, in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to make His Name dwell there. Thou shalt bring the tithes of thy corn, and of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the firstborn of thy cattle, and of thy sheep; that thou mayest learn to fear the LORD thy God all the days.
    24 And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able to carry them [thither], because the place is far from thee, which the LORD thy God shall choose to make His Name dwell there; for the LORD thy God shall bless thee,
    25 then shalt thou turn them into silver, and shalt take the silver in thy hand, and shalt go unto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose.
    26 And thou shalt bestow the silver for whatsoever thy soul desireth, for oxen, or for sheep, for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever thy soul desireth. And thou shalt eat there before the LORD thy God, and thou shalt rejoice, thou, and thine household,
    27 and the Levite that is within thy gates; thou shalt not forsake him, for he hath no portion nor inheritance with thee.
    28 At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thy produce in that year, and shalt lay it up within thy gates;
    29 and the Levite shall come, for he hath no portion nor inheritance with thee, and the sojourner, and the orphan, and the widow, that are within thy gates; and they shall eat and be satisfied; that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hands which thou doest.

    **Chapter 15**
    1 At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release.
    2 And this is the manner of the release: Thou shalt release every debt of thine own, which thy neighbour oweth thee; thou shalt not exact it of thy neighbour, nor of thy brother; for a release unto the LORD thy God hath been proclaimed.
    3 Of a foreigner thou mayest exact whatsoever thou hast with him; but unto thy brother thou shalt make a release of thy debt.
    4 For there shall not be among thee any needy; for the LORD thy God shall surely bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it.
    5 If only thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the LORD your God, to keep and to do
