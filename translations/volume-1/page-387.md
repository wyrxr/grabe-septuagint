ΚΕΦ. ΛΒ΄. ΔΕΥΤΕΡΟΝΟΜΙΟΝ 372
εἰς ἣν ὑμεῖς διαβαίνετε τὸν Ἰορδάνην ἔχει, κληρονομήσαι αὐτήν.
48 Καὶ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ταύτῃ, λέγων·
49 ἀνάβηθι εἰς τὸ ὄρος τὸ Ἀβαρείμ τοῦτο, ὄρος Ναβαῦ, ὃ ἐστιν ἐν
γῇ Μωάβ κατὰ πρόσωπον Ἱεριχῶ, καὶ ἴδε τὴν γῆν Χαναάν, ἣν
50 ἐγὼ δίδωμι τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραὴλ εἰς κατάσχεσιν· καὶ τελευτᾷ ἐν τῷ
ὄρει εἰς ὃ ἀναβαίνεις ἐκεῖ, καὶ προστέθητι πρὸς τὸν λαόν σου,
ὃν τρόπον ἀπέθανεν Ἀαρὼν ὁ ἀδελφός σου ἐν Ὡρ τῷ ὄρει, καὶ
51 προσετέθη πρὸς τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ· διότι ἠπειθήσατε τῷ ῥήματί μου
ἐν τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραὴλ ἐπὶ τοῦ ὕδατος ἀντιλογίας Κάδης ἐν τῇ ἐρή-
52 μῳ Σίν, διότι οὐχ ἡγιάσατέ με ἐν τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ· ἔτι ἀπέναντι
ἕξῃ τὴν γῆν, καὶ ἐκεῖ οὐκ εἰσελεύσῃ εἰς τὴν γῆν, ἣν ἐγὼ δίδω-
μι τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ.

ΚΕΦ. ΛΓ΄. XXXIII.

1 ΚΑΙ αὕτη ἡ εὐλογία, ἣν ηὐλόγησε Μωυσῆς ἄνθρωπος τοῦ Θεοῦ
τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ πρὸ τελευτῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπε· Κύριος ἐκ
2 Σινὰ ἥκει, καὶ ἐπέφανεν ἐκ Σηεὶρ ἡμῖν, καὶ κατέσπευσεν ἐξ ὄρους
Φαρὰν σὺν μυριάσι Κάδης· ἐκ δεξιῶν αὐτοῦ ἄγγελοι μετ᾿
3 αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐφείσατο τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντες οἱ ἡγιασμένοι
ὑπὸ τὰς χεῖράς σου, καὶ οὗτοι ὑπὸ σέ εἰσι· καὶ ἐδέξατο ἀπὸ τῶν
4 λόγων αὐτοῦ νόμον, ὃν ἐνετείλατο Μωυσῆς ἡμῖν, κληρονομίαν
συναγωγαῖς Ἰακώβ.
5 Καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῷ ἠγαπημένῳ ἄρχων, συναχθέντων ἀρχόντων λαῶν
ἅμα φυλαῖς Ἰσραήλ.
6 Ζήτω Ῥουβήν, καὶ μὴ ἀποθανέτω· καὶ Συμεὼν ἔστω πολὺς ἐν
ἀριθμῷ.
7 Καὶ αὕτη Ἰούδα· καὶ εἶπεν· εἰσάκουσον Κύριε τῆς φωνῆς Ἰούδα,
καὶ εἰς τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ εἰσέλθοις ἂν αἱ χεῖρες αὐτοῦ διακρίνουσιν
αὐτῷ,
8 καὶ βοηθὸς ἐκ τῶν ἐχθρῶν αὐτοῦ ἔσῃ. Καὶ τῷ Λευὶ εἶπε· δότε
Λευὶ δήλους αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀλήθειαν αὐτοῦ τῷ ἀνδρὶ τῷ ὁσίῳ, ὃν
9 ἐπείρασαν αὐτὸν ἐν πείρᾳ, ἐλοιδόρησαν αὐτὸν ἐφ᾿ ὕδατος
ἀντιλογίας. Ὁ λέγων τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ, οὐχ
ἑώρακά σε, καὶ τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἔγνω, καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς
αὐτοῦ ἀπέγνω·
10 ὅτι ἐφύλαξε τὰ λόγιά σου, καὶ τὴν διαθήκην σου διετήρησε.
Δηλώσουσι τὰ δικαιώματά σου τῷ Ἰακώβ, καὶ τὸν νόμον σου τῷ
Ἰσραήλ· ἐπιθήσουσι θυμίαμα ἐν ὀργῇ σου διαπαντὸς ἐπὶ τοῦ
11 θυσιαστηρίου σου. Εὐλόγησον Κύριε τὴν ἰσχὺν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰ ἔργα

**Deuteronomy 32**

47 ...into which ye cross over Jordan, to inherit it.
48 And the Lord spoke unto Moses on that same day, saying,
49 "Ascend this Mount Abarim, Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which
50 I give unto the sons of Israel for a possession. And thou shalt die on the mountain unto which thou ascendest there, and shalt be gathered to thy people,
51 in the manner that Aaron thy brother died in Mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people; because ye disobeyed My word among the sons of Israel at the waters of Meribah Kadesh in the wilderness
52 of Sin; because ye did not sanctify Me among the sons of Israel. Yet from afar shalt thou see the land, but thither shalt thou not enter into the land, which I give unto the sons of Israel."

**Deuteronomy 33**

1 And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses, the man of God, blessed the sons of Israel before his death. And he said:
2 The LORD came from Sinai, and shined forth unto us from Seir; and He hastened down from Mount Paran with myriads of Kadesh; from His right hand were angels with Him.
3 And He spared His people, and all the sanctified [are] under thy hands, and these are under thee. And he received a law from His words, which Moses commanded us, a heritage for the congregations of Jacob.
5 And there shall be a ruler in the Beloved One, when the rulers of the peoples are gathered together with the tribes of Israel.
6 May Reuben live, and not die; and let Simeon be many in number.
7 And this for Judah. And he said: "Hear, O LORD, the voice of Judah, and mayest Thou come in unto his people; his hands judge for him,
8 and [mayest Thou] be a helper against his enemies." And to Levi he said: "Give to Levi his Urim and his Thummim to the holy man,
9 whom they tempted in a trial; they reviled him at the waters of Meribah. Who said unto his father and unto his mother, 'I have not seen thee,' and his brethren he knew not, and his own sons he disowned;
10 for he kept Thy oracles, and Thy covenant did he preserve. They shall declare Thy judgments unto Jacob, and Thy law unto Israel; they shall put incense in Thy wrath continually upon Thine altar.
11 Bless, O LORD, his strength, and accept the work of his hands."
