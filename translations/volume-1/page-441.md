τοὺς κατοικοῦντας Δαβείρ· καὶ τὸ ὄνομα Δαβείρ ἦν ἔμπροσθεν πό-
12 λις γραμμάτων. Καὶ εἶπε Χάλεβ· ὃς ἂν πατάξῃ τὴν πόλιν τῶν
γραμμάτων, καὶ προκαταλάβηται αὐτήν, δώσω αὐτῷ τὴν Ἀσχὰν
13 θυγατέρα μου εἰς γυναῖκα. Καὶ προκατελάβετο αὐτὴν Γοθονιὴλ υἱὸς
Κενέζ, ἀδελφὸς Χάλεβ ὁ νεώτερος ὑπὲρ αὐτόν· καὶ ἔδωκεν
14 αὐτῷ τὴν Ἀσχὰν θυγατέρα αὐτοῦ εἰς γυναῖκα. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ
εἰσπορεύεσθαι αὐτήν, καὶ ἐπέσεισεν αὐτὴν αἰτῆσαι παρὰ τοῦ πα-
τρὸς αὐτῆς τὸν ἀγρόν. Καὶ ἐγόγγυζεν ἐπάνω τοῦ ὑποζυγίου, καὶ
ἔκραξεν ἀπὸ τοῦ ὑποζυγίου· εἰς γῆν νότου ἐκδέδοσαί με. Καὶ εἶ-
15 πεν αὐτῇ Χάλεβ· τί ἐστί σοι; Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Ἀσχά· δός μοι
εὐλογίαν· ὅτι εἰς γῆν νότου ἐκδέδομαί σε, καὶ δώσεις μοι λύτρω-
σιν ὕδατος. Καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῇ Χάλεβ κατὰ τὴν καρδίαν αὐτῆς
τὴν λύτρωσιν μετεώρων, καὶ τὴν λύτρωσιν ταπεινῶν. Καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ
16 Ἰωβάβ τοῦ Κιναίου, πενθεροῦ Μωυσῆ, ἀνέβησαν ἐκ τῆς πόλεως
τῶν φοινίκων πρὸς τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰούδα εἰς τὴν ἔρημον Ἰούδα. τὴν
οὖσαν ἐν τῷ νότῳ ἐπὶ καταβάσεως Ἀράδ· καὶ ἐπορεύθη, καὶ κα-
17 τῴκησε μετὰ τοῦ λαοῦ. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη Ἰούδας μετὰ Συμεὼν τοῦ
ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπάταξαν τὸν Χαναναῖον τὸν κατοικοῦντα Σε-
φέθ, (καὶ ἀνεθεμάτισαν αὐτήν,) καὶ ἐξωλόθρευσαν αὐτήν· καὶ ἐκά-
18 λεσαν τὸ ὄνομα τῆς πόλεως, Ἐξολόθρευσις. Καὶ (οὐχ) ἐκληρονό-
μησεν Ἰούδας τὴν Γάζαν καὶ τὸ ὅριον αὐτῆς, καὶ τὴν Ἀσκάλωνα
καὶ τὸ ὅριον αὐτῆς, καὶ τὴν Ἀκκαρὼν καὶ τὸ ὅριον αὐτῆς,
19 καὶ τὴν Ἄζωτον καὶ τὰ περισπόρια αὐτῆς. Καὶ Κύριος ἦν μετὰ
Ἰούδα· καὶ ἐκληρονόμησε τὸ ὄρος, ὅτι οὐκ ἐδύνατο κληρονομῆ-
σαι τοὺς κατοικοῦντας τὴν κοιλάδα, ὅτι Ῥηχὰβ διεστέλλετο αὐτοῖς.
20 Καὶ ἔδωκαν τῷ Χάλεβ τὴν Χεβρών, καθὰ ἐλάλησε Μωυσῆς· (καὶ
ἐκληρονόμησεν ἐκεῖθεν τὰς τρεῖς πόλεις,) καὶ ἐξῆρεν ἐκεῖθεν
21 τοὺς τρεῖς υἱοὺς Ἐνάκ. Καὶ τὸν Ἰεβουσαῖον τὸν κατοικοῦντα
ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ οὐκ ἐξῆραν οἱ υἱοὶ Βενιαμίν· καὶ κατῴκησεν ὁ
Ἰεβουσαῖος μετὰ τῶν υἱῶν Βενιαμὶν ἐν Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἕως τῆς ἡ-
22 μέρας ταύτης. Καὶ ἀνέβησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰωσὴφ καίγε αὐτοὶ εἰς Βαι-
θήλ. καὶ Ἰούδας μετ’ αὐτῶν· καὶ παρενέβαλον οἶκος Ἰσραὴλ κα-
τὰ Βαιθήλ· τὸ δὲ ὄνομα τῆς πόλεως ἦν ἔμπροσθεν Λουζά.
24 Καὶ ἴδον οἱ φυλάσσοντες ἄνδρα ἐκπορευόμενον ἐκ τῆς πόλεως, καὶ
ἔλαβον αὐτόν, καὶ εἶπον αὐτῷ· δεῖξον ἡμῖν τὴν εἴσοδον τῆς πό-
25 λεως, καὶ ποιήσομεν μετὰ σοῦ ἔλεος. Καὶ ἔδειξεν αὐτοῖς τὴν εἴ-

**JUDGES**
**CHAPTER 1.**

**11.** ...against the inhabitants of Debir.
(Now the name of Debir was aforetime the City of Letters.)
**12.** And Caleb said,
"Whosoever shall smite the City of Letters
and take it,
to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife."
**13.** And Othniel the son of Kenaz,
the brother of Caleb, who was younger, yet above him,
took it:
and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.
**14.** And it came to pass, when she entered [into her new home],
that he incited her to ask a field of her father.
And she murmured upon the beast of burden,
and cried out from the beast of burden, saying,
"Into a land of the south hast thou given me!"
And Caleb said unto her, "What aileth thee?"
**15.** And Achsah said unto him,
"Give me a blessing;
for into a land of the south have I been delivered thee,
and thou wilt give me springs of water."
And Caleb gave her according to her heart's desire
the upper springs and the nether springs.

**16.** And the children of Hobab the Kenite,
the father-in-law of Moses,
went up out of the City of Palm Trees
unto the children of Judah,
into the wilderness of Judah,
which was in the south, by the descent of Arad;
and he went and dwelt among the people.
**17.** And Judah went with Simeon his brother,
and they smote the Canaanites that dwelt in Zephath,
(and they utterly destroyed it,)
and they utterly destroyed it;
and the name of the city was called Hormah [that is, Utter Destruction].

**18.** And Judah did not inherit Gaza with its border,
nor Ashkelon with its border,
nor Ekron with its border,
nor Ashdod with its surrounding fields.
**19.** And the LORD was with Judah;
and he inherited the mountain [country];
for he could not drive out them that dwelt in the valley,
because Rechab [the chariots] stood arrayed against them.
**20.** And they gave Hebron unto Caleb,
as Moses had spoken;
(and he inherited from thence the three cities,)
and he drove out from thence the three sons of Anak.
**21.** But the children of Benjamin did not drive out
the Jebusites that dwelt in Jerusalem;
and the Jebusites dwelt with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem
unto this day.

**22.** And the children of Joseph, even they themselves, went up to Bethel;
and Judah was with them:
and the house of Israel encamped against Bethel.
(Now the name of the city was aforetime Luz.)
**24.** And the watchers saw a man coming out of the city;
and they took him, and said unto him,
"Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance of the city,
and we shall deal kindly with thee."
**25.** And he shewed them the entrance of the city:
and they smote the city with the edge of the sword;
but the man and his kindred they sent forth.
