σκευὴ ἡμῶν, καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες ἡμῶν, καὶ αἱ κτήσεις ἡμῶν, καὶ
πάντα τὰ κτήνη ἡμῶν (καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες ἡμῶν) ἔσονται ἐκεῖ ἐν ταῖς
27 πόλεσι Γαλαάδ· οἱ δὲ παῖδές σου παρελεύσονται πάντες ἐνωπλι-
     σμένοι, ἐκτεταγμένοι ἔναντι Κυρίου εἰς τὸν πόλεμον, ὃν τρόπον ὁ
28 κύριος (μου) λέγει. Καὶ συνέστησεν αὐτοῖς Μωυσῆς Ἐλεάζαρ τὸν
     ἱερέα, καὶ Ἰησοῦν υἱὸν Ναυῆ, καὶ τοὺς ἄρχοντας πατριῶν τῶν φυ-
29 λῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ· καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτοὺς Μωυσῆς· ἐὰν διαβῶσιν οἱ
     υἱοὶ Ῥουβὴν καὶ υἱοὶ Γὰδ μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν τὸν Ἰορδάνην, πᾶς ἐνω-
     πλισμένος εἰς πόλεμον ἔναντι Κυρίου, καὶ κατακυριεύσητε τῆς γῆς
     ἀπέναντι ὑμῶν, καὶ δώσετε αὐτοῖς τὴν γῆν Γαλαὰδ ἐν κατασχέ-
30 σει. Ἐὰν δὲ μὴ διαβῶσιν ἐνωπλισμένοι μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν εἰς πόλεμον
     ἔναντι Κυρίου, καὶ διαβιβάσετε τὴν ἀποσκευὴν αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰς
     γυναῖκας αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰ κτήνη αὐτῶν πρότερα ὑμῶν εἰς γῆν Χα-
     ναάν, καὶ συγκατακληρονομηθήσονται ἐν ὑμῖν ἐν τῇ γῇ Χαναάν.
31 Καὶ ἀπεκρίθησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ῥουβὴν καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Γὰδ, λέγοντες· ὅσα
32 ὁ Κύριος λέγει τοῖς θεράπουσί σου, οὕτω ποιήσωμεν· ἡμεῖς δια-
     βησόμεθα ἔναντι Κυρίου ἐνωπλισμένοι εἰς τὴν γῆν Χαναάν, καὶ
     δώσομεν τὴν κατάσχεσιν τῆς κληρονομίας ἡμῶν ἐν τῷ πέραν τοῦ
33 Ἰορδάνου. Καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς Μωυσῆς τοῖς υἱοῖς Γὰδ, καὶ τοῖς
     υἱοῖς Ῥουβὴν, καὶ τῷ ἡμίσει φυλῆς Μανασσῆ υἱῶν Ἰωσήφ, τὴν
     βασιλείαν Σηὼν βασιλέως τῶν Ἀμοῤῥαίων, καὶ τὴν βασιλείαν Ὤγ βασι-
     λέως τῆς Βασὰν, τὴν γῆν καὶ τὰς πόλεις σὺν τοῖς ὁρίοις (αὐττῆς), πό-
34 λεις τῆς γῆς κύκλῳ. Καὶ ᾠκοδόμησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Γὰδ τὴν Δαιβὼν, καὶ τὴν
35 Ἀταρὼθ, καὶ τὴν Ἀροήρ, καὶ τὴν (γῆν) Ἀταρὼθ Σωρὰς καὶ τὴν Ἰαζὴρ,
36 καὶ ὤψωσαν αὐτὰς, καὶ τὴν Ναμφὰ καὶ τὴν Βαιθαρρὰ πόλεις ὀχυρὰς καὶ
37 ἐπαύλεις προβάτων. Καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Ῥουβὴν ᾠκοδόμησαν τὴν Ἑσεβὼν,
38 καὶ τὴν Ἐλεαλὴ, καὶ τὴν Καριαθαὶμ, καὶ τὴν Ναβὼ καὶ τὴν Βε-
     ελμεὼν, περικεκυκλωμένας ὀνόματι, καὶ τὴν Σεβμὰ, καὶ ἐπωνό-
     μασαν κατὰ τὰ ὀνόματα αὐτῶν τὰ ὀνόματα τῶν πόλεων, ἃς ᾠκοδό-
39 μησαν. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη υἱὸς Μαχεὶρ υἱοῦ Μανασσῆ εἰς Γαλαάδ,
     καὶ ἔλαβεν αὐτὴν, καὶ ἀπώλεσε τὸν Ἀμοῤῥαῖον τὸν κατοικοῦντα
40 ἐν αὐτῇ. Καὶ ἔδωκε Μωυσῆς τὴν Γαλαὰδ τῷ Μαχεὶρ υἱῷ Μα-
41 νασσῆ, καὶ κατώκησεν ἐκεῖ. Καὶ Ἰαεὶρ ὁ τοῦ Μανασσῆ ἐπορεύθη,
     καὶ ἔλαβε τὰς ἐπαύλεις αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπωνόμασεν αὐτὰς ἐπαύλεις
42 Ἰαχείρ. Καὶ Ναβαὺ ἐπορεύθη, καὶ ἔλαβε τὴν Κανὰθ καὶ τὰς κώμας
     αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐπωνόμασεν αὐτὰς Ναβὼθ ἐκ τοῦ ὀνόματος αὐτοῦ.

**Numbers**
**Chapter 32**

26 Our baggage, and our wives, and our possessions, and all our cattle [and our wives] shall be there in the cities of Gilead.
27 But thy sons shall pass over, all of them armed, arrayed before the Lord for war, even as the Lord [my] saith.
28 And Moses charged them, even Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the chiefs of the fathers’ houses of the tribes of the children of Israel.
29 And Moses said unto them: If the children of Reuben and the children of Gad shall pass with you over the Jordan, every man armed for war before the Lord, and ye shall subdue the land before you, then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession.
30 But if they shall not pass over with you, being armed for war before the Lord, then ye shall cause to pass over their baggage, and their wives, and their cattle before you into the land of Canaan; and they shall inherit together with you in the land of Canaan.
31 And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad answered, saying: Whatsoever the Lord saith unto thy servants, so will we do.
32 We ourselves shall pass over armed before the Lord into the land of Canaan; and we shall take possession of our inheritance beyond the Jordan.
33 And Moses gave unto them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, the sons of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon, king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og, king of Bashan, the land and the cities with its borders, even the cities of the land round about.
34 And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer;
35 and the [land of] Ataroth Soras, and Jazer;
36 and they raised them high, and Nampha, and Betharrah, fortified cities and sheepfolds.
37 And the children of Reuben built Heshbon,
38 and Elealeh, and Kiriathaim, and Nebo, and Baal-Meon, being encompassed by name, and Sibmah; and they named the cities which they built according to their own names.
39 And Machir the son of Manasseh went into Gilead, and took it, and destroyed the Amorite that dwelt therein.
40 And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh, and he dwelt there.
41 And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took their villages, and named them Jair’s Villages.
42 And Nobah went and took Kenath and its dependent towns, and named them Nobath after his own name.
