ΚΕΦ. Μ΄. ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ. 73

**Original Greek Text (with light OCR corrections):**
ἶδεν αὐτούς, καὶ ἦσαν τεταραγμένοι. Καὶ ἠρώτα τοὺς εὐνούχους 7
Φαραώ, οἳ ἦσαν μετ’ αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ φυλακῇ παρὰ τῷ κυρίῳ αὐτοῦ,
λέγων· τί ὅτι τὰ πρόσωπα ὑμῶν σκυθρωπὰ σήμερον; Οἱ δὲ εἶπαν 8
αὐτῷ· ἐνύπνιον ἴδομεν, καὶ ὁ συγκρίνων αὐτὸ οὐκ ἔστιν. Εἶπε δὲ
αὐτοῖς Ἰωσήφ· οὐχὶ διὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡ διασάρησις αὐτῶν ἐστι; διη-
γήσασθε οὖν μοι. Καὶ διηγήσατο ὁ ἀρχιοινοχόος τὸ ἐνύπνιον 9
αὐτοῦ τῷ Ἰωσήφ, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· ἐν τῷ ὕπνῳ μου ἦν ἄμπελος
ἐναντίον μου· ἐν δὲ τῇ ἀμπέλῳ τρεῖς πυθμένες, καὶ αὐτὴ θάλ- 10
λουσα ἀνενηνοχυῖα βλαστοὺς· πέπειροι οἱ βότρυες σταφυλῆς. Καὶ 11
τὸ ποτήριον Φαραὼ ἐν τῇ χειρί μου· καὶ ἔλαβον τὴν σταφυλὴν
καὶ ἐξέθλιψα αὐτὴν εἰς τὸ ποτήριον, καὶ ἔδωκα τὸ ποτήριον εἰς
τὰς χεῖρας Φαραώ. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Ἰωσήφ· τοῦτο ἡ σύγκρισις 12
αὐτοῦ. Οἱ τρεῖς πυθμένες, τρεῖς ἡμέραι εἰσίν· ἔτι τρεῖς ἡμέραι, 13
καὶ μνησθήσεται Φαραὼ τῆς ἀρχῆς σου, καὶ ἀποκαταστήσει σε
ἐπὶ τὴν ἀρχιοινοχοσίαν σου, καὶ δώσεις τὸ ποτήριον Φαραὼ εἰς
τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ κατὰ τὴν ἀρχήν σου τὴν προτέραν, ὡς ἤσθα οἰ-
νοχρῶν. Ἀλλὰ μνήσθητί μου διὰ σεαυτοῦ, ὅταν εὖ σοι γένηται, 14
καὶ ποιήσεις ἐν ἐμοὶ ἔλεος, καὶ μνησθήσῃ περὶ ἐμοῦ πρὸς Φα-
ραώ, καὶ ἐξάξεις με ἐκ τοῦ ὀχυρώματος τούτου· ὅτι κλοπῇ ἐκλά- 15
πην ἐκ γῆς Ἑβραίων, καὶ ὧδε οὐκ ἐποίησα οὐδέν, ἀλλ’ ἐνέβα-
λόν με εἰς τὸν λάκκον τοῦτον. Καὶ ἴδεν ὁ ἀρχισιτοποιός, ὅτι ὀρ- 16
θῶς συνέκρινε, καὶ εἶπε τῷ Ἰωσήφ· κἀγὼ ἴδον ἐνύπνιον, καὶ ὤμην
τρία κανᾶ χονδριτῶν αἴρειν ἐπὶ τῆς κεφαλῆς μου· ἐν δὲ τῷ κανῷ 17
τῷ ἐπάνω ἀπὸ πάντων (τῶν γενημάτων) ὧν ὁ βασιλεὺς Φαραὼ
ἐσθίει, ἔργον σιτοποιοῦ, καὶ τὰ πετεινὰ (τοῦ οὐρανοῦ) κατήσθιεν
αὐτὰ ἀπὸ τοῦ κανοῦ τοῦ ἐπάνω τῆς κεφαλῆς μου. Ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ 18
Ἰωσήφ, εἶπεν αὐτῷ· αὕτη ἡ σύγκρισις αὐτοῦ. Τὰ τρία κανᾶ, τρεῖς
ἡμέραι εἰσίν· ἔτι τριῶν ἡμερῶν, ἀφελεῖ Φαραὼ τὴν κεφαλήν σου 19
ἀπὸ σοῦ, καὶ κρεμάσει σε ἐπὶ ξύλου, καὶ φάγεται τὰ ὄρνεα τοῦ 20
οὐρανοῦ τὰς σάρκας σου ἀπὸ σοῦ. Ἐγένετο δὲ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ
τρίτῃ, ἡμέρᾳ γενέσεως ἦν Φαραώ, καὶ ἐποίη πότον· πᾶσι τοῖς
παῖσιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐμνήσθη τῆς ἀρχῆς τοῦ ἀρχιοινοχόου καὶ τῆς
ἀρχῆς τοῦ ἀρχισιτοποιοῦ ἐν μέσῳ τῶν παίδων αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἀπε- 21
κατέστησεν τὸν ἀρχιοινοχόον ἐπὶ τὴν ἀρχὴν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔδωκε τὸ
ποτήριον εἰς τὴν χεῖρα Φαραώ· τὸν δὲ ἀρχισιτοποιὸν ἐκρέμασε 22

CHAPTER XL. GENESIS.

7 And he beheld them, and they were troubled. And he inquired of the eunuchs of Pharaoh, who were with him in the ward in his lord’s house, saying, "Wherefore are your countenances so sad today?"
8 And they said unto him, "We have dreamed a dream, and there is no man who can interpret it." And Joseph said unto them, "Is not the interpretation thereof from God? Relate [it] therefore unto me."
9 And the chief butler told his dream unto Joseph, and said unto him, "In my dream, behold, a vine stood before me;
10 and in the vine were three stems, and it was blossoming and had brought forth shoots. The clusters of grapes were ripe.
11 And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes and pressed them into the cup, and gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand."
12 And Joseph said unto him, "This is the interpretation thereof. The three stems are three days.
13 Yet within three days, Pharaoh shall remember thine office, and shall restore thee unto thy butler-ship; and thou shalt give Pharaoh’s cup into his hand, according to thine former office, as thou wast wont to pour wine.
14 But remember me, I pray thee, when it shall be well with thee, and show kindness unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me forth out of this stronghold;
15 for by stealth was I stolen away from the land of the Hebrews, and here have I done nothing amiss, yet have they cast me into this pit."
16 And when the chief baker saw that he had interpreted [it] rightly, he said unto Joseph, "I also have seen a dream, and behold, I thought I carried three baskets of fine flour cakes upon my head;
17 and in the uppermost basket were all manner of baked meats (of the produce) for Pharaoh, the work of a baker; and the birds (of the heaven) did eat them out of the uppermost basket upon my head."
18 And Joseph answered and said unto him, "This is the interpretation thereof. The three baskets are three days.
19 Yet within three days, shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee upon a tree;
20 and the birds of the heaven shall eat thy flesh from off thee." And it came to pass on the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, and he made a feast unto all his servants;
21 and he remembered the office of the chief butler and the office of the chief baker in the midst of his servants. And he restored the chief butler unto his office, and he gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.
22 But the chief baker he hanged,
