᾿Ααρών, ὅ,τε Ναδάβ, καὶ ᾿Αβιούδ, καὶ ᾿Ελεάζαρ, καὶ Ἰθάμαρ.
61 Καὶ ἀπέθανε Ναδάβ καὶ ᾿Αβιούδ ἐν τῷ προσφέρειν αὐτοὺς πῦρ
62 ἀλλότριον ἔναντι Κυρίου ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ Σινᾷ. Καὶ ἐγενήθησαν ἐξ
ἐπισκέψεως αὐτῶν, τρεῖς καὶ εἴκοσι χιλιάδες, πᾶν ἀρσενικὸν ἀπὸ
μηνιαίου καὶ ἐπάνω· οὐ γὰρ συνεπενεσκέπτησαν ἐν τοῖς υἱοῖς ᾿Ισραήλ,
63 ὅτι οὐ δίδοται αὐτοῖς κλῆρος ἐν μέσῳ υἱῶν ᾿Ισραήλ. Καὶ
αὕτη ἡ ἐπίσκεψις Μωσῆ καὶ ᾿Ελεάζαρ τοῦ ἱερέως, οἳ ἐπεσκέ-
ψαντο τοὺς υἱεῖς ᾿Ισραήλ ἐν ᾿Αραβὼθ Μωάβ, ἐπὶ τοῦ ᾿Ιορδάνου
64 κατὰ ᾿Ιεριχώ. Καὶ ἐν τούτοις οὐκ ἦν ἄνθρωπος τῶν ἐπεσκεμμέ-
νων ὑπὸ Μωσῆ καὶ ᾿Ααρὼν τοῦ ἱερέως, οὓς ἐπεσκέψαντο τοὺς υἱοὺς
65 ᾿Ισραὴλ ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ Σινᾷ. Ὅτι εἶπε Κύριος αὐτοῖς· θανάτῳ
ἀποθανοῦνται ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ· καὶ οὐ κατελείφθη ἐξ αὐτῶν οὐδὲ εἷς,
πλὴν Χάλεβ υἱὸς ᾿Ιεφοννῆ, καὶ ᾿Ιησοῦς υἱὸς Ναυῆ.

1 ΚΑΙ προσελθοῦσαι αἱ θυγατέρες Σαλπαὰδ υἱοῦ ᾿Ορέρ, υἱοῦ
Γαλαάδ, υἱοῦ Μαχεὶρ, υἱοῦ Μανασσῆ, τοῦ δήμου (Μανασσῆ, τῶν
υἱῶν ᾿Ιωσήφ, καὶ ταῦτα τὰ ὀνόματα αὐτῶν, Μαλὰ, καὶ Νουὰ,
2 καὶ Αἰγλὰ, καὶ Μελχὰ, καὶ Θερσά.) καὶ στᾶσαι ἔναντι Μωσῆ,
καὶ ἔναντι ᾿Ελεάζαρ τοῦ ἱερέως, καὶ ἔναντι τῶν ἀρχόντων, καὶ
ἔναντι πάσης τῆς συναγωγῆς ἐπὶ τῆς θύρας τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρ-
3 τυρίου, λέγουσιν· ὁ πατὴρ ἡμῶν ἀπέθανεν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, καὶ αὐ-
τὸς οὐκ ἦν ἐν μέσῳ τῆς συναγωγῆς τῆς ἐπισυστάσης ἔναντι Κυ-
ρίου ἐν τῇ συναγωγῇ Κορέ, ὅτι διὰ ἁμαρτίαν αὐτοῦ ἀπέθανε· καὶ
4 υἱοὶ οὐκ ἐγένοντο αὐτῷ. Μὴ ἐξαλειφθήτω τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ πατρὸς
ἡμῶν ἐκ μέσου τοῦ δήμου αὐτοῦ, ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν αὐτῷ υἱός· δότε
5 ἡμῖν κατάσχεσιν ἐν μέσῳ τῶν ἀδελφῶν πατρὸς ἡμῶν. Καὶ προσ-
6 ήγαγε Μωσῆς τὴν κρίσιν αὐτῶν ἔναντι Κυρίου. Καὶ ἐλάλησε
7 Κύριος πρὸς Μωσῆν, λέγων· ὡς ὀρθῶς θυγατέρες Σαλπαὰδ λε-
λαλήκασι· δόμα δώσεις αὐταῖς κατάσχεσιν κληρονομίας ἐν μέσῳ
ἀδελφῶν πατρὸς αὐτῶν, καὶ περιθήσεις τὸν κλῆρον τοῦ πατρὸς
8 αὐτῶν αὐταῖς. Καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς ᾿Ισραὴλ λαλήσεις, λέγων· ἄν-
θρωπος ἐὰν ἀποθάνῃ, καὶ υἱὸς μὴ ᾖ αὐτῷ, περιθήσετε τὴν κλη-
9 ρονομίαν αὐτοῦ τῇ θυγατρὶ αὐτοῦ. ᾿Εὰν δὲ μὴ ᾖ θυγάτηρ αὐτῷ,
10 δώσετε τὴν κληρονομίαν αὐτοῦ τῷ ἀδελφῷ αὐτοῦ. ᾿Εὰν δὲ μὴ

Aaron, [and] Nadab, and Abihu, and Eleazar, and Ithamar.
61 And Nadab and Abihu died when they offered strange fire
62 before the Lord in the wilderness of Sinai. And the sum of their census was twenty-three thousand, every male from a month old and upward; for they were not numbered among the sons of Israel,
63 because no inheritance is given to them among the sons of Israel. And this was the census of Moses and Eleazar the priest, who surveyed the sons of Israel in the plains of Moab, by the Jordan
64 by Jericho. And among these there was not a man of those who had been counted by Moses and Aaron the priest, whom they had surveyed [among] the sons of
65 Israel in the wilderness of Sinai. For the Lord had said unto them, "They shall surely die in the wilderness"; and not one of them was left, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.

1 THEN came near the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the tribe (Manasseh, of the sons of Joseph; and these were the names of them: Mahlah, and Noah,
2 and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah.) And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the leaders, and before all the congregation at the door of the tabernacle of testimony,
3 saying, "Our father died in the wilderness; and he himself was not in the midst of the congregation that gathered itself together before the Lord in the congregation of Korah, because for his own sin he died; and
4 sons were not born unto him. Let not the name of our father be blotted out from the midst of his tribe, because he hath no son; give ye
5 unto us a possession among the brethren of our father." And Moses
6 brought their judgment before the Lord. And the Lord spoke
7 unto Moses, saying, "The daughters of Zelophehad have spoken rightly; thou shalt surely give them a possession of inheritance among the brethren of their father, and thou shalt assign the inheritance of their father
8 unto them. And unto the sons of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, 'If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall assign his inheritance to
9 his daughter. And if he have no daughter,
10 ye shall give his inheritance unto his brother. And if he have no
