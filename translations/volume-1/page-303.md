1 ΚΑΙ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωσῆν, λέγων·
2 ἔντειλαι τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτούς, λέγων· τὰ δῶρά μου δόματά μου καρπώματά μου εἰς ὀσμὴν εὐωδίας διατηρήσατε προσ-
3 φέρειν μοι ἐν ταῖς ἑορταῖς μου. Καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτούς· ταῦτα τὰ
4 καρπώματα ὅσα προσάξετε Κυρίῳ, ἀμνοὺς ἐνιαυσίους ἀμώμους δύο τὴν ἡμέραν εἰς ὁλοκαύτωσιν ἐνδελεχῶς· τὸν ἀμνὸν τὸν ἕνα ποιή-
5 σετε τὸ πρωΐ, καὶ τὸν ἀμνὸν τὸν δεύτερον ποιήσετε τὸ πρὸς ἑσ-
6 πέραν. Καὶ ποιήσεις τὸ δέκατον τοῦ οἰφὶ σεμιδάλιν εἰς θυσίαν ἀναπεποιημένην ἐν ἐλαίῳ ἐν τετάρτῳ τοῦ ἴν. Ὁλοκαύτωμα ἐνδε-
7 λεχισμοῦ, ἢ γενομένη ἐν τῷ ὄρει Σινᾶ εἰς ὀσμὴν εὐωδίας, κάρ-
8 πωμα Κυρίῳ. Καὶ σπονδὴ αὐτοῦ τὸ τέταρτον τοῦ ἴν τῷ ἀμνῷ τῷ ἑνί· ἐν τῷ ἁγίῳ σπείσεις σπονδὴν σίκερα Κυρίῳ. Καὶ τὸν ἀμνὸν τὸν
9 δεύτερον ποιήσεις τὸ πρὸς ἑσπέραν· κατὰ τὴν θυσίαν αὐτοῦ τὴν πρωϊνήν, καὶ κατὰ τὴν σπονδὴν αὐτοῦ ποιήσετε εἰς ὀσμὴν εὐωδίας Κυ-
10 ρίῳ. Καὶ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῶν σαββάτων προσάξετε δύο ἀμνοὺς ἐνιαυσίους ἀμώμους, καὶ δύο δέκατα σεμιδάλεως εἰς θυσίαν ἀναπεποιη-
11 μένης ἐν ἐλαίῳ, καὶ σπονδὴν αὐτοῦ· ὁλοκαύτωμα σαββάτου ἐν τοῖς σαββάτοις, ἐπὶ τῆς ὁλοκαυτώσεως τῆς διαπαντὸς καὶ τὴν
12 σπονδὴν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐν ταῖς νουμηνίαις προσάξετε ὁλοκαύτωμα τῷ Κυρίῳ μόσχους ἐκ βοῶν δύο, καὶ κριὸν ἕνα, ἀμνοὺς ἐνιαυσίους ἑπτὰ ἀμώμους· τρία δέκατα σεμιδάλεως θυσίαν ἀναπεποι-
13 ημένης ἐν ἐλαίῳ τῷ μόσχῳ τῷ ἑνί, καὶ δύο δέκατα σεμιδάλεως θυσίαν ἀναπεποιημένης ἐν ἐλαίῳ τῷ κριῷ τῷ ἑνί, καὶ δέκατον
14 δέκατον σεμιδάλεως θυσίαν ἀναπεποιημένης ἐν ἐλαίῳ τῷ ἀμνῷ τῷ ἑνί· θυσίαν ὀσμὴν εὐωδίας κάρπωμα Κυρίῳ. Ἡ σπονδὴ αὐ-
15 τῶν τὸ ἥμισυ τοῦ ἴν ἔσται τῷ μόσχῳ τῷ ἑνί· καὶ τὸ τρίτον τοῦ ἴν ἔσται τῷ κριῷ τῷ ἑνί· καὶ τὸ τέταρτον τοῦ ἴν ἔσται τῷ ἀμνῷ τῷ ἑνὶ οἴνου. Τοῦτο τὸ ὁλοκαύτωμα μῆνα ἐκ μηνὸς εἰς τοὺς μῆ-
16 νας τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ. Καὶ χίμαρον ἐξ αἰγῶν ἕνα περὶ ἁμαρτίας Κυρίῳ, ἐπὶ τῆς ὁλοκαυτώσεως τῆς διαπαντὸς ποιηθήσεται, καὶ ἡ
17 σπονδὴ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐν τῷ μηνὶ τῷ πρώτῳ τεσσαρεσκαιδεκάτῃ ἡμέρᾳ τοῦ μηνὸς πάσχα Κυρίῳ. Καὶ τῇ πεντεκαιδεκάτῃ ἡμέρᾳ τοῦ μηνὸς τούτου (ποιηθήσεται) ἑορτή· ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας ἄζυμα ἔδεσθε.

#### Chapter XXVIII

1 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying:
2 “Command the children of Israel, and thou shalt say unto them, My offerings, My gifts, My burnt offerings,
3 for a sweet savour, ye shall take heed to offer unto Me upon My appointed feasts.
4 And thou shalt say unto them, These are the offerings which ye shall offer unto the Lord: two lambs of the first year, without blemish,
5 daily for a continual burnt offering. The one lamb shalt thou prepare in the morning,
6 and the second lamb shalt thou prepare toward the evening.
7 And thou shalt offer the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering, mingled with oil, the fourth part of a hin.
8 A continual burnt offering, even that which was ordained upon Mount Sinai, for a sweet savour, an offering by fire unto the Lord.
9 And the drink offering thereof shall be the fourth part of a hin for the one lamb: in the holy place shalt thou pour out a drink offering of strong drink unto the Lord. And the second lamb shalt thou prepare toward the evening: according to the meal offering of the morning,
10 and according to the drink offering thereof, shall ye prepare [it] for a sweet savour unto the Lord.
11 And on the Sabbath day ye shall offer two lambs of the first year without blemish, and two tenth parts of fine flour for a meal offering mingled with oil, and the drink offering thereof:
12 this is the burnt offering for the Sabbath, upon the Sabbaths, besides the continual burnt offering and its drink offering. And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the Lord: two young bullocks out of the herd, and one ram, seven lambs of the first year without blemish.
13 And three tenth parts of fine flour for a meal offering mingled with oil for one bullock, and two tenth parts of fine flour
14 for a meal offering mingled with oil for one ram; and a tenth part for each lamb of the first year, [even] a meal offering mingled with oil for each lamb: a meal offering for a sweet savour, an offering by fire unto the Lord.
15 Their drink offering shall be half a hin for one bullock, and the third part of a hin for one ram, and the fourth part of a hin of wine for each lamb. This is the burnt offering of the month throughout the months of the year.
16 And one kid of the goats for a sin offering unto the Lord; it shall be offered in addition to the continual burnt offering and its drink offering.
17 And on the fourteenth day of the first month is the Lord’s Passover. And on the fifteenth day of this month (there shall be kept) a feast; seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread.
