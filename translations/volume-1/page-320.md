ΚΑΙ προσῆλθον οἱ ἄρχοντες πατριῶν φυλῆς υἱῶν Γαλαὰδ υἱοῦ 1
Μαχεὶρ υἱοῦ Μανασσῆ ἐκ τῆς φυλῆς υἱῶν Ἰωσήφ, καὶ ἐλάλησαν ἔναντι
Μωυσῆ, καὶ ἔναντι Ἐλεάζαρ τοῦ ἱερέως, καὶ ἔναντι τῶν ἀρχόν-
των οἴκων πατριῶν τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ εἶπαν· τῷ κυρίῳ ἡμῶν ἐνετεί- 2
λατο Κύριος ἀποδοῦναι τὴν γῆν τῆς κληρονομίας ἐν κλήρῳ τοῖς
υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ τῷ κυρίῳ (μου) συνέταξε Κύριος δοῦναι τὴν κληρονο-
μίαν Σαλπαὰδ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ ἡμῶν ταῖς θυγατράσιν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐὰν
ἔσονται ἐνὶ τῶν υἱῶν τῶν φυλῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ γυναῖκες, καὶ ἀφαιρεθήσεται 3
ὁ κλῆρος αὐτῶν ἐκ τῆς κατασχέσεως τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν, καὶ προσ-
τεθήσεται εἰς τὴν κληρονομίαν τῆς φυλῆς, εἰς ἃς γένωνται γυναῖ-
κες, καὶ ἐκ τοῦ κλήρου τῆς κληρονομίας ἡμῶν ἀφαιρεθήσεται· ἐὰν 4
δὲ γένηται ἡ αἵρεσις τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ προστεθήσεται ἡ κλη-
ρονομία αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τὴν κληρονομίαν τῆς φυλῆς, οἷς ἂν γένων-
ται γυναῖκες, καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς κληρονομίας φυλῆς πατριᾶς ἡμῶν ἀφαι-
ρεθήσεται ἡ κληρονομία αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐνετείλατο Μωυσῆς τοῖς υἱοῖς 5
Ἰσραὴλ διὰ προστάγματος Κυρίου, λέγων· οὕτως φυλὴ υἱῶν Ἰω-
σὴφ λέγουσι. Τοῦτο τὸ ῥῆμα ὁ συνέταξε Κύριος ταῖς θυγατράσι 6
Σαλπαὰδ, λέγων· οὐ ἀρέσκει ἐναντίον αὐτῶν, ἔστωσαν γυναῖκες, πλὴν
ἐκ τοῦ δήμου τῆς φυλῆς τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῶν ἔστωσαν γυναῖκες·
καὶ οὐχὶ περιστραφήσεται κληρονομία τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραὴλ ἀπὸ φυ- 7
λῆς ἐπὶ φυλὴν, ὅτι ἕκαστος ἐν τῇ κληρονομία τῆς φυλῆς τῆς πα-
τριᾶς αὐτοῦ προσκολληθήσονται οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ πᾶσα θυγάτηρ 8
ἀγχιστεύουσα κληρονομίαν ἐκ τῶν φυλῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ, ἐνὶ τῶν
ἐκ τοῦ δήμου τῆς φυλῆς τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῆς ἔσονται γυναῖκες, ἵνα
ἀγχιστεύσωσιν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἕκαστος τὴν κληρονομίαν τὴν πατρι-
κὴν αὐτοῦ· καὶ οὐ περιστραφήσεται κλῆρος ἐκ φυλῆς ἐπὶ φυλὴν 9
ἑτέραν, ἀλλ᾿ ἕκαστος ἐν τῇ κληρονομία αὐτοῦ προσκολληθήσονται
αἱ φυλαί, οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ. Ὃν τρόπον συνέταξε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυ- 10
σῆν, οὕτως ἐποίησαν θυγατέρες Σαλπαάδ. Καὶ ἐγένοντο Μαλλὰ, 11
καὶ Θερσὰ, καὶ Αἰγλὰ, καὶ Μελχὰ, καὶ Νοῦα, θυγατέρες Σαλ-

CHAPTER XXXVI

¹Then drew near the chiefs of the fathers’ houses
of the tribe of the sons of Gilead, the son of Machir,
the son of Manasseh, of the tribe of the sons of Joseph;
and they spake before Moses,
and before Eleazar the priest,
and before the princes of the houses of the fathers’
houses of the sons of Israel, and they said:
²“Unto our lord did the Lord command
to apportion the land of the inheritance by lot
unto the sons of Israel; and unto [our] lord
(my lord) did the Lord command to give the inheritance
of Salpaad our brother unto his daughters.
³And should they become wives unto any
of the sons of the tribes of the sons of Israel,
then shall their inheritance be taken from the possession
of our fathers, and it shall be added unto the inheritance
of the tribe unto which they shall become wives;
and from the lot of our inheritance shall it be taken away.
⁴And if the choice of the sons of Israel shall come to pass,
then shall their inheritance be added unto the inheritance
of the tribe unto which they shall become wives;
and from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers’ house
shall their inheritance be taken away.”

⁵And Moses commanded the sons of Israel by the precept
of the Lord, saying: “Thus do the tribe of the sons of Joseph say:
⁶This is the word which the Lord hath commanded
concerning the daughters of Salpaad, saying:
‘It pleaseth not before them [to marry outside their kin];
let them be wives, save only from the family
of the tribe of their father let them be wives.
⁷And an inheritance shall not turn about
for the sons of Israel from tribe to tribe,
for each one of the sons of Israel shall cleave
unto the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers’ house.
⁸And every daughter inheriting an inheritance
from the tribes of the sons of Israel,
unto one of the family of the tribe of her father
shall they be wives, that the sons of Israel may each inherit
his paternal inheritance.
⁹And no lot shall turn about from tribe unto another tribe,
but each one of the tribes, the sons of Israel,
shall cleave unto his own inheritance.’”

¹⁰In the manner which the Lord commanded unto Moses,
so did the daughters of Salpaad do.
¹¹And Maalla, and Thersa, and Aegla, and Melcha, and Noua,
the daughters of Salpaad, became wives unto their cousins;
¹²from the family of the sons of Manasseh, son of Joseph,
they became wives [unto them]; and their inheritance came upon
the tribe of the family of their father.
