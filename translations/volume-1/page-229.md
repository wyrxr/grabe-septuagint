23 αὐτοῦ τὰ ἅγια τῶν ἁγίων, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ἁγίων φάγεται. Πλὴν
    πρὸς τὸ καταπέτασμα οὐ προσελεύσεται, καὶ πρὸς τὸ θυσιαστή-
    ριον οὐκ ἐγγιεῖ, ὅτι μῶμον ἔχει· καὶ οὐ βεβηλώσει τὸ ἅγιον τοῦ
    Θεοῦ, ὅτι ἐγὼ (εἰμι) Κύριος ἁγιάζων αὐτούς. Καὶ ἐλάλησε Κύριος
24 πρὸς Μωυσῆν καὶ ᾿Ααρὼν καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ, καὶ πρὸς πάν-
    τας υἱοὺς ᾿Ισραήλ.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΒʹ. XXII.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, λέγων· 2 εἶπον ᾿Ααρὼ
    καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ, καὶ προσεχέτωσαν ἀπὸ τῶν ἁγίων υἱῶν
    ᾿Ισραήλ, καὶ οὐ βεβηλώσουσι τὸ ὄνομα τὸ ἅγιόν μου, ὅσα αὐτοὶ
3 ἁγιάζουσι μοι· ἐγὼ Κύριος. Εἶπον αὐτοῖς· εἰς τὰς γενεὰς ὑμῶν
    πᾶς ἄνθρωπος, ὃς ἂν προσέλθῃ ἀπὸ παντὸς σπέρματος ὑμῶν πρὸς
    τὰ ἅγια, ὅσα ἂν ἁγιάζωσιν οἱ υἱοὶ ᾿Ισραὴλ τῷ Κυρίῳ, καὶ ἡ
    ἀκαθαρσία αὐτοῦ ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ, ἐξολοθρευθήσεται ἡ ψυχὴ ἐκείνη ἀπ᾿
4 ἐμοῦ· ἐγὼ Κύριος (ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν.) Καὶ ἄνθρωπος ἐκ τοῦ σπέρ-
    ματος ᾿Ααρὼν τοῦ ἱερέως, καὶ οὗτος λεπρὸς ἢ γονορρύης, τῶν
    ἁγίων οὐκ ἔδεται, ἕως ἂν καθαρισθῇ· καὶ ὁ ἀπτόμενος πάσης
    ἀκαθαρσίας ψυχῆς, ἢ ἄνθρωπος ᾧ ἂν ἐξέλθῃ ἐξ αὐτοῦ κοίτη σπέρ-
5 ματος, ἢ ὅστις ἂν ἅψηται παντὸς ἑρπετοῦ ἀκαθάρτου, ὃ μιανεῖ
    αὐτόν, ἢ ἐπ᾿ ἀνθρώπῳ, ἐν ᾧ μιανεῖ αὐτὸν κατὰ πᾶσαν ἀκαθαρ-
6 σίαν αὐτοῦ· ψυχὴ ἥτις ἅψηται αὐτῶν, ἀκάθαρτος ἔσται ἕως ἑσπέ-
    ρας· οὐκ ἔδεται ἀπὸ τῶν ἁγίων, ἐὰν μὴ λούσηται τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ
7 ὕδατι, καὶ δύῃ ὁ ἥλιος, καὶ καθαρὸς ἔσται· καὶ τότε φάγεται ἀπὸ
8 τῶν ἁγίων, ὅτι ἄρτος ἐστὶν αὐτοῦ. Θνησιμαῖον καὶ θηριάλωτον
9 οὐκ ἔδεται, μιανθῆναι αὐτὸν ἐν αὐτοῖς· ἐγὼ Κύριος. Καὶ φυλά-
    ξουσι τὰ φυλάγματά μου, ἵνα μὴ λάβωσι δι᾿ αὐτὰ ἁμαρτίαν, καὶ
    ἀποθάνωσι δι᾿ αὐτό, ἐὰν (δὲ) βεβηλώσιν αὐτά· ἐγὼ Κύριος (ὁ Θεὸς)
10 ὁ ἁγιάζων αὐτούς. Καὶ πᾶς ἀλλογενὴς οὐ φάγεται ἅγια· πάροι-
11 χος ἱερέως, ἢ μισθωτός, οὐ φάγεται ἅγια. ᾿Εὰν δὲ ἱερεὺς κτή-
    σηται ψυχὴν ἔγκτητον ἀργυρίου, οὗτος φάγεται ἐκ τῶν ἄρτων
    αὐτοῦ· καὶ οἱ οἰκογενεῖς αὐτοῦ καὶ οὗτοι φάγονται τῶν ἄρτων
12 αὐτοῦ. Καὶ θυγάτηρ ἀνθρώπου ἱερέως ἐὰν γένηται ἀνδρὶ ἀλλογε-
13 νεῖ, αὕτη τῶν ἀπαρχῶν τῶν ἁγίων οὐ φάγεται. Καὶ θυγάτηρ ἀν-
    θρώπου ἱερέως ἐὰν γένηται χήρα ἢ ἐκβεβλημένη, σπέρμα δὲ μὴ

**Leviticus Chapter 21, 22**

23 His most holy things of the holy things, and of the holy things shall he eat. Nevertheless, unto the veil shall he not come near, and unto the altar shall he not draw nigh, for he hath a blemish; and he shall not profane the holy [things] of God, for I [am] the Lord, who sanctifieth them.
24 And the Lord spake unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the sons of Israel.

**Chapter 22**

1 AND the Lord spake unto Moses, saying:
2 “Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, and let them beware of the holy things of the sons of Israel, and they shall not profane My holy Name, [even] all those things which they do sanctify unto Me; I [am] the Lord.
3 Say unto them: Throughout your generations, whatsoever man of all your seed shall approach unto the holy things, which the sons of Israel do sanctify unto the Lord, and his uncleanness [be] upon him, that soul shall be cut off from Me; I [am] the Lord [your God].
4 And a man of the seed of Aaron the priest, and he [be] a leper, or one who hath a discharge, of the holy things shall he not eat, until he be clean; and he that toucheth any uncleanness of a soul, or a man from whom a seminal discharge shall have issued,
5 Or whosoever shall touch any unclean creeping thing, which shall defile him, or [touch] a man, by whom he shall be defiled according to all his uncleanness;
6 The soul which toucheth any of them, shall be unclean until the even; he shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his body with water,
7 And the sun be set, and he shall be clean; and then shall he eat of the holy things, for it is his food.
8 That which dieth of itself, and that which is torn by beasts, shall he not eat, that he be not defiled thereby; I [am] the Lord.
9 And they shall keep My charge, lest they incur sin thereby, and die for it, if they profane them; I [am] the Lord [God] who sanctifieth them.
10 And no stranger shall eat holy things; a sojourner of a priest, or a hired servant, shall not eat holy things.
11 But if a priest purchase a soul [as] an acquired possession by money, he shall eat of his bread; and those who are born in his house, even they shall eat of his bread.
12 And if a daughter of a priest be married unto a stranger, she shall not eat of the firstfruits of the holy things.
13 And if a daughter of a priest become a widow, or be cast out, and have no seed,”
