αὐτοῦ. Καὶ προσήνεγκε τὰ δῶρα τῷ ᾿Εγλὼμ βασιλεῖ Μωάβ· καὶ 17
᾿Εγλὼμ ἀνὴρ ἀστεῖος σφόδρα. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς συνετέλεσεν ᾿Αὼδ 18
προσφέρων τὰ δῶρα, καὶ ἐξαπέστειλε τοὺς αἴροντας τὰ δῶρα. καὶ 19
᾿Εγλὼμ ἀνέστρεψεν ἀπὸ τῶν γλυπτῶν, τῶν μετὰ τῆς Γαγάλ. Καὶ
εἶπεν ᾿Αώδ· λόγος μοι κρύφιος πρός σε, βασιλεύ. Καὶ εἶπεν ᾿Ε-
γλὼμ πᾶσιν ἐκ μέσου. Καὶ ἐξῆλθον ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ πάντες οἱ παρα-
στήκοντες αὐτῷ. Καὶ ᾿Αὼδ εἰσῆλθε πρὸς αὐτόν· καὶ ἐκάθητο ἐν 20
τῷ ὑπερῴῳ τῷ θερινῷ αὐτοῦ μονώτατος. Καὶ εἶπεν ᾿Αώδ· λόγος
Θεοῦ μοι πρός σε, βασιλεύ. Καὶ ἐξανέστη ἀπὸ τοῦ θρόνου ᾿Εγλὼμ
ἐγγύς αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἅμα τοῦ ἀναστῆναι, ἐξέτεινεν ᾿Αὼδ 21
τὴν χεῖρα τὴν ἀριστερὰν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔλαβε τὴν μάχαιραν ἀπὸ τοῦ
μηροῦ τοῦ δεξιοῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐνέπηξεν αὐτὴν εἰς τὴν κοιλίαν ᾿Ε-
γλώμ· καὶ ἐπεισήνεγκε καίγε τὴν λαβὴν ὀπίσω τῆς φλογός, καὶ 22
ἀπέκλεισε τὸ στέαρ κατὰ τῆς φλογός, ὅτι οὐκ ἐξέσπασε τὴν μά-
χαιραν ἐκ τῆς κοιλίας αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ᾿Αὼδ εἰς τὴν προστά- 23
δα, καὶ ἀπέκλεισε τὰς θύρας τοῦ ὑπερῴου ἐπ᾿ αὐτόν, καὶ ἐσφρή-
νωσε. Καὶ αὐτὸς ἐξῆλθε· καὶ οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῦ εἰσῆλθον, καὶ ἰδόν, 24
καὶ ἰδοὺ αἱ θύραι τοῦ ὑπερῴου ἀποκεκλεισμέναι. Καὶ εἶπαν· μή-
ποτε πρὸς δίῤῥους κάθηται ἐν τῇ ἀποχωρήσει τοῦ κοιτῶνος. Καὶ 25
προσέμειναν αἰσχυνόμενοι· καὶ ἰδοὺ οὐκ ἦν ὁ ἀνοίγων τὰς θύρας
τοῦ ὑπερῴου. Καὶ ἔλαβον τὴν κλεῖδα, καὶ ἤνοιξαν· καὶ ἰδοὺ ὁ
κύριος αὐτῶν πεπτωκὼς ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν τεθνηκώς. Καὶ ᾿Αὼδ διεσώ- 26
θη ἕως ἐθορυβοῦντο, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ προσενῶν αὐτῷ· καὶ αὐτὸς πα-
ρῆλθε τὰ γλυπτά, καὶ διεσώθη ἕως Σειρωθά. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἡνίκα 27
ἦλθε, καὶ ἐσάλπισεν ἐν κερατίνῃ ἐν τῷ ὄρει ᾿Εφραίμ· καὶ κατέ-
βησαν σὺν αὐτῷ οἱ υἱοὶ ᾿Ισραὴλ ἀπὸ τοῦ ὄρους, καὶ αὐτὸς ἔμπρο-
σθεν αὐτῶν. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτούς· καταβαίνετε ὀπίσω μου, ὅτι 28
παρέδωκε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τοὺς ἐχθροὺς ὑμῶν, τὴν Μωάβ, ἐν χει-
ρὶ ὑμῶν. Καὶ κατέβησαν ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ, καὶ προκατελάβοντο τὰς
διαβάσεις τοῦ ᾿Ιορδάνου τῆς Μωάβ, καὶ οὐκ ἀφῆκαν ἄνδρα διαβῆ-
ναι. Καὶ ἐπάταξαν τὴν Μωάβ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ ὡσεὶ δέκα 29
χιλιάδας ἀνδρῶν, πάντας τοὺς μαχητάς, καὶ πάντας ἄνδρας δυ-
νάμεως· καὶ οὐ διεσώθη ἀνήρ. Καὶ ἐνετράπη Μωὰβ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ 30
ἐκείνῃ ὑπὸ τὴν χεῖρα ᾿Ισραήλ, καὶ ἡσύχασεν ἡ γῆ ὀγδοή-
κοντα ἔτη. καὶ ἔκρινεν αὐτοὺς ᾿Αὼδ ἕως οὗ ἀπέθανε. Καὶ μετὰ 31
τοῦτον ἀνέστη Σαμεγὰρ υἱὸς ᾿Ανὰθ, καὶ ἐπάταξε τοὺς ἀλλοφύ-
λους εἰς ἑξακοσίους ἄνδρας (ἐν τῷ ἀροτρόποδι) ἐκτὸς μόσχων
(βοῶν)· καὶ ἔσωσεν αὐτὸς τὸν Ἰσραήλ.

**JUDGES**
**CHAPTER 3.**

**17.** his. And he presented the gifts unto Eglon, the king of Moab; and Eglon was a man exceedingly comely.
**18.** And it came to pass, when Ehud had finished offering the gifts, that he sent away those who carried the gifts.
**19.** And Eglon returned from the graven images, which were by Gilgal. And Ehud said, "A secret word have I unto thee, O King." And Eglon said unto all, "Depart from the midst!" And all those who stood by him went forth from him.
**20.** And Ehud came in unto him; and he was sitting in his summer upper chamber, quite alone. And Ehud said, "A word from God have I unto thee, O King." And Eglon rose up from his throne, [coming] near him.
**21.** And it came to pass, as soon as he rose up, Ehud stretched forth his left hand, and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into Eglon's belly.
**22.** And he brought in even the hilt after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, for he drew not the sword out of his belly.
**23.** And Ehud went forth unto the porch, and closed the doors of the upper chamber upon him, and sealed them.
**24.** And when he had gone out, his servants came in, and they saw, and behold, the doors of the upper chamber were shut. And they said, "Perchance he sitteth upon the double-seat in the privacy of the chamber."
**25.** And they waited until they were ashamed; and behold, there was no one who would open the doors of the upper chamber. And they took the key, and opened [them]; and behold, their lord had fallen upon the earth, dead.
**26.** And Ehud escaped while they were disturbed, and there was no one drawing near to him; and he passed beyond the graven images, and escaped unto Seirath.
**27.** And it came to pass, when he came, he blew the trumpet with a horn in Mount Ephraim; and the children of Israel came down with him from the mountain, and he [was] before them.
**28.** And he said unto them, "Go down after me, for the Lord God hath delivered your enemies, even Moab, into your hand." And they went down after him, and seized beforehand the fords of Jordan which were of Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.
**29.** And they smote Moab at that time, about ten thousand men, all the warriors, and all mighty men; and not a man escaped.
**30.** And Moab was humbled on that day under the hand of Israel, and the land had rest eighty years. And Ehud judged them until he died.
**31.** And after him arose Shamgar, the son of Anath, and he smote the Philistines, six hundred men (with an ox-goad), apart from calves (oxen); and he himself saved Israel.
