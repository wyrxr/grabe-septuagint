The Greek text from the 1850s Athens reprint of the Grabe Septuagint, based on Codex Alexandrinus, has been carefully reviewed for OCR errors. Corrections are limited to diacritical marks, punctuation, and spacing, in accordance with the provided instructions, to ensure grammaticality and textual probability without altering spelling or word choices. The sole exception is the word "ἐπισιτι-" at the end of verse 39. While literally a truncated word due to a page break in the original printing and faithfully rendered as such by the OCR, its incompleteness makes the verse ungrammatical and textually improbable in isolation. To uphold the directive for a "beautiful, clear, and faithful style" and to produce a "highly literary translation" that remains true to the original text's intended meaning, the translation completes this word based on the full phrase available in the subsequent context. However, the Greek text provided below maintains "ἐπισιτι-" as it was given, reflecting its appearance at the page break.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΒ΄. ΕΞΟΔΟΣ 117
ρων τῶν σταθμῶν, καὶ προελεύσεται Κύριος τὴν θύραν, καὶ οὐκ
ἀφήσει τὸν ὀλοθρεύοντα εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὰς οἰκίας ὑμῶν πατάξαι.
24 Καὶ φυλάξεσθε τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο νόμιμον αἰώνιον σεαυτῷ, καὶ τοῖς
υἱοῖς σου ἕως αἰῶνος· 25 ἐὰν δὲ εἰσέλθητε εἰς τὴν γῆν, ἣν ἂν δῷ
Κύριος ὑμῖν, καθότι ἐλάλησε, φυλάξεσθε τὴν λατρείαν ταύτην.
26 Καὶ ἔσται ἐὰν λέγωσι πρὸς ὑμᾶς οἱ υἱοὶ ὑμῶν· τίς ἡ λατρεία
αὕτη ὑμῖν; 27 καὶ ἐρεῖτε αὐτοῖς· θυσία τὸ πάσχα τοῦτο Κυρίῳ, ὡς
σκέπασε τοὺς οἴκους τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ, ἡνίκα ἐπά-
ταξε τοὺς Αἰγυπτίους, τοὺς δὲ οἴκους ἡμῶν ἐῤῥύσατο. 28 Καὶ κύ-
ψας ὁ λαὸς προσεκύνησε. Καὶ ἀπελθόντες ἐποίησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ,
καθὰ ἐνετείλατο Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ καὶ Ἀαρών, οὕτως ἐποίησαν.
29 Ἐγενήθη δὲ μεσούσης τῆς νυκτός, καὶ Κύριος ἐπάταξε πᾶν πρω-
τότοκον ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ, ἀπὸ πρωτοτόκου Φαραὼ τοῦ καθημένου
ἐπὶ τοῦ θρόνου αὐτοῦ, (καὶ) ἕως πρωτοτόκου τῆς αἰχμαλωτίδος τῆς
ἐν τῷ λάκκῳ, καὶ πᾶν πρωτότοκον κτήνους. 30 Καὶ ἀνέστη Φαραὼ
νυκτός, καὶ πάντες οἱ θεράποντες αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντες οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι,
καὶ ἐγενήθη κραυγὴ μεγάλη ἐν πάσῃ γῇ Αἰγύπτου· οὐ γὰρ ἦν οἰ-
κία, ἐν ᾗ οὐκ ἦν ἐν αὐτῇ τεθνηκώς. 31 Καὶ ἐκάλεσε Φαραὼ Μωυσῆν
καὶ Ἀαρὼν νυκτός, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· ἀνάστητε καὶ ἐξέλθετε
ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ μου, καὶ ὑμεῖς καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ· βαδίζετε, λα-
τρεύετε Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ ὑμῶν, καθὰ λέγετε· 32 καὶ τὰ πρόβατα,
καὶ τοὺς βόας ὑμῶν ἀναλαβόντες πορεύεσθε, καθάπερ εἰρήκατε· εὐ-
λογήσατε δὴ κἀμέ. 33 Καὶ κατεβιάζοντο οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι τὸν λαὸν,
σπουδῇ ἐκβαλεῖν αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς· εἶπαν γάρ· ὅτι πάντες ἡμεῖς
ἀποθνήσκομεν. 34 Ἀνέλαβε δὲ ὁ λαὸς τὸ σταῖς αὐτῶν, πρὸ τοῦ ζυ-
μωθῆναι, τὰ φυράματα αὐτῶν ἐνδεδεμένα ἐν τοῖς ἱματίοις αὐτῶν
ἐπὶ τῶν ὤμων. 35 Οἱ δὲ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐποίησαν, καθὰ συνέταξεν αὐ-
τοῖς Μωυσῆς· καὶ ἤτησαν παρὰ τῶν Αἰγυπτίων σκεύη χρυσᾶ καὶ
ἀργυρᾶ καὶ ἱματισμόν. 36 Καὶ Κύριος ἔδωκε τὴν χάριν τῷ λαῷ αὐ-
τοῦ ἐναντίον τῶν Αἰγυπτίων, καὶ ἔχρησαν αὐτοῖς· καὶ ἐσκύλευσαν
τοὺς Αἰγυπτίους. 37 Ἀπῆραν δὲ οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐκ Ῥαμεσσῇ εἰς Σοκ-
χώθ εἰς ἑξακοσίας χιλιάδας πεζῶν, οἱ ἄνδρες, πλὴν ἀποσκευῆς·
38 καὶ ἐπίμικτος πολὺς συνανέβη αὐτοῖς, καὶ πρόβατα, καὶ βόες, καὶ
κτήνη πολλὰ σφόδρα. 39 Καὶ ἔπεψαν τὸ σταῖς ὃ ἐξήνεγκαν ἐξ Αἰ-
γύπτου, ἐγκρυφίας ἀζύμους, οὐ γὰρ ἐζυμώθη· ἐξέβαλον γὰρ αὐ-
τοὺς οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι· οὐ γὰρ ἐδυνάσθησαν ὑπομεῖναι, οὐδὲ ἐπισιτι-

### EXODUS

... of the doorposts; and the Lord shall go forth through the door, and He shall not suffer the destroyer to enter into your houses to smite [you].

<sup>24</sup> And ye shall observe this thing, an everlasting ordinance, for thyself and for thy sons forever.
<sup>25</sup> And when ye shall come into the land, which the Lord shall give unto you, as He hath spoken, ye shall observe this service.
<sup>26</sup> And it shall be, when your children shall say unto you, "What meaneth this service unto you?"
<sup>27</sup> Then ye shall say unto them, "It is the sacrifice of the Lord's Passover, for that He passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when He smote the Egyptians, but our houses He delivered."
<sup>28</sup> And the people bowed down and worshipped. And the children of Israel went away and did as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron; so did they.

<sup>29</sup> And it came to pass at midnight, that the Lord smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne, even unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of cattle.
<sup>30</sup> And Pharaoh rose up in the night, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in all the land of Egypt, for there was not a house where there was not one dead therein.
<sup>31</sup> And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron by night, and said unto them, "Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; go, serve the Lord your God, as ye have said.
<sup>32</sup> And take your sheep and your cattle, as ye have said, and depart; and bless me also."
<sup>33</sup> And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, "We are all [as] dead men."
<sup>34</sup> And the people took their dough, before it was leavened, their kneading-troughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.
<sup>35</sup> And the children of Israel had done according to the word of Moses; and they asked of the Egyptians articles of gold and articles of silver, and raiment.
<sup>36</sup> And the Lord gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, and they lent unto them; and they plundered the Egyptians.
<sup>37</sup> And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides children.
<sup>38</sup> And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and sheep, and cattle, and very many beasts.
<sup>39</sup> And they baked the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, unleavened cakes, for it was not leavened; for the Egyptians drove them out, for they could not tarry, nor [had they prepared] provision.
