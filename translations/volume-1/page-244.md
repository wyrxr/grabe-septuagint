ΑΡΙΘΜΟΙ.
ΚΕΦΑΛΑΙΟΝ Α΄. Ι.

Και ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωϋσῆν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ τῇ Σινᾷ, 1
ἐν τῇ σκηνῇ τοῦ μαρτυρίου, ἐν μιᾷ τοῦ μηνὸς τοῦ δευτέρου, ἔ-
τους δευτέρου ἐξελθόντων αὐτῶν ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, λέγων· Λάβετε 2
ἀρχὴν πάσης συναγωγῆς υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ κατὰ συγγενείας αὐτῶν,
κατ᾿ οἴκους πατριῶν αὐτῶν, κατὰ ἀριθμὸν ἐξ ὀνόματος αὐτῶν,
κατὰ κεφαλὴν αὐτῶν, πᾶς ἄρσην ἀπὸ εἰκοσαετοῦς καὶ ἐπάνω, 3
πᾶς δ᾿ ἐκπορευόμενος ἐν δυνάμει Ἰσραὴλ ἐπισκέψασθε αὐτοὺς ἐν
δυνάμει αὐτῶν, σὺ καὶ ᾿Ααρὼν ἐπισκέψασθε αὐτοὺς καὶ μεθ᾿ ὑ- 4
μῶν ἔσονται ἕκαστος ἕκαστος κατὰ φυλήν, ἕκαστος ἀρχόντων,
κατ᾿ οἴκους πατριῶν ἔσονται. Καὶ ταῦτα τὰ ὀνόματα τῶν ἀνδρῶν, 5
οἵτινες παραστήσονται μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν· τῶν ῾Ρουβήν, ᾿Ελισοῦρ υἱὸς Σε-
διούρ· 6 τῶν Συμεών, Σαλαμιήλ υἱὸς Σουρισαδαΐ· τῶν ᾿Ιούδα, Ναασ- 7
σὼν υἱὸς ᾿Αμιναδάβ· 8 τῶν ᾿Ισσάχαρ, Ναθαναήλ υἱὸς Σωγάρ· τῶν 9
Ζαβουλών, ᾿Ελιὰβ υἱὸς Χαιλών· τῶν υἱῶν ᾿Ιωσήφ, τῶν ᾿Εφραίμ,
᾿Ελισαμὰ υἱὸς ᾿Εμιούδ· τῶν Μανασσῆ, Γαμαλιήλ υἱὸς Φαδασ- 10
σούρ· 11 τῶν Βενιαμίν, ᾿Αβιδὰν υἱὸς Γαδεωνί· τῶν Δάν, ᾿Αχιέ- 12
ζερ υἱὸς ᾿Αμισαδαΐ· 13 τῶν ᾿Ασήρ, Φαγαήλ υἱὸς ᾿Εχράν· τῶν 14
Γάδ, ᾿Ελισὰφ υἱὸς ῾Ραγουήλ· τῶν Νεφθαλί, ᾿Αχιρὲ υἱὸς Αἰνάν. 15
Οὗτοι ἐπίκλητοι τῆς συναγωγῆς, ἄρχοντες τῶν φυλῶν κατὰ πα- 16
τριὰς αὐτῶν, χιλίαρχοι Ἰσραὴλ εἰσι. Καὶ ἔλαβε Μωϋσῆς καὶ 17
᾿Ααρὼν τοὺς ἄνδρας τούτους τοὺς ἀνακληθέντας ἐξ ὀνόματος, καὶ 18
πᾶσαν συναγωγὴν ἐξεκλησίασαν ἐν μιᾷ τοῦ μηνὸς τοῦ δευτέρου
ἔτους, καὶ ἐπεσκέπησαν κατὰ γενέσεις αὐτῶν, κατὰ πατριὰς αὐ-
τῶν, κατὰ ἀριθμὸν ὀνομάτων αὐτῶν, ἀπὸ εἰκοσαετοῦς καὶ ἐπάνω,
πᾶν ἀρσενικὸν κατὰ κεφαλὴν αὐτῶν· ὃν τρόπον συνέταξε Κύριος 19
τῷ Μωϋσῇ, καὶ ἐπεσκέπησαν αὐτοὶ ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ τοῦ Σινᾷ. Καὶ 20

**NUMBERS. CHAPTER I.**

1 And the Lord spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai,
2 In the tabernacle of testimony, on the first [day] of the second month, in the second year after their going forth from the land of Egypt, saying,
“Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the sons of Israel according to their kindreds,
3 By the houses of their fathers, according to the number of their names, by their polls; every male from twenty years old and upward, even every one that goeth forth into the host of Israel. Ye shall muster them according to their might.
4 Thou and Aaron shall muster them; and with you there shall be, each one, even each one, according to his tribe, each one [being] of the princes. They shall be by the houses of their fathers.”
5 And these are the names of the men who shall stand with you: for Reuben, Elisour the son of Sediour;
6 For Simeon, Salamiel the son of Sourisadaï;
7 For Judah, Naasson the son of Aminadab;
8 For Issachar, Nathanael the son of Sogar;
9 For Zebulon, Eliab the son of Chailon;
10 Of the sons of Joseph: for Ephraim, Elisama the son of Emioud; for Manasseh, Gamaliel the son of Phadassour;
11 For Benjamin, Abidan the son of Gadeoni;
12 For Dan, Achiezer the son of Amisadaï;
13 For Asher, Phagael the son of Echran;
14 For Gad, Elisaph the son of Ragouel;
15 For Naphtali, Achire the son of Einan.
16 These are the summoned of the congregation, the princes of the tribes according to their fathers' houses; they are the captains of thousands in Israel.
17 And Moses and Aaron took these men who were called by name;
18 And they assembled all the congregation on the first [day] of the second month of the year, and they were mustered according to their generations, according to their fathers' houses, according to the number of their names, from twenty years old and upward,
19 Every male by their polls; in the manner that the Lord commanded Moses, and they themselves were mustered in the wilderness of Sinai.
