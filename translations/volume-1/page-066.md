μᾶλλον ἢ Λείαν· καὶ ἐδούλευσεν αὐτῷ ἑπτὰ ἔτη ἕτερα. Ἰδὼν δὲ 31
Κύριος (ὁ Θεός) ὅτι μισεῖται Λεία, ἤνοιξε τὴν μήτραν αὐτῆς· Ῥα-
χὴλ δὲ ἦν στεῖρα. Καὶ συνέλαβε Λεία, καὶ ἔτεκεν υἱὸν τῷ Ἰα- 32
κώβ· ἐκάλεσε δὲ τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ, Ῥουβήν, λέγουσα· διότι εἶδέ μου
Κύριος τὴν ταπείνωσιν, νῦν οὖν ἀγαπήσει με ὁ ἀνήρ μου. Καὶ 33
συνέλαβε πάλιν Λεία, καὶ ἔτεκεν υἱὸν δεύτερον τῷ Ἰακώβ, καὶ εἶ-
πεν· ὅτι ἤκουσε Κύριος ὅτι μισοῦμαι, καὶ προσέδωκέ μοι καὶ τοῦ-
τον· καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ, Συμεών. Καὶ συνέλαβεν ἔτι, καὶ 34
ἔτεκεν υἱόν, καὶ εἶπεν· ἐν τῷ νῦν καιρῷ πρὸς ἐμοῦ ἔσται ὁ ἀνήρ μου,
τέτοκα γὰρ αὐτῷ τρεῖς υἱούς· διὰ τοῦτο ἐκάλεσε τὸ ὄ-
νομα αὐτοῦ, Λευί. Καὶ συλλαβοῦσα ἔτι, ἔτεκεν υἱόν, καὶ εἶπε· νῦν 35
ἔτι τοῦτο ἐξομολογήσομαι Κυρίῳ· διὰ τοῦτο ἐκάλεσε τὸ ὄνομα
αὐτοῦ, Ἰούδα. Καὶ ἔστη τοῦ τίκτειν.

ΙΔΟΥΣΑ δὲ Ῥαχὴλ, ὅτι οὐ τέτοκε τῷ Ἰακώβ, καὶ ἐζήλωσε 1
Ῥαχὴλ τὴν ἀδελφὴν αὐτῆς, καὶ εἶπε τῷ Ἰακώβ· δός μοι τέκνα·
εἰ δὲ μὴ, τελευτήσω ἐγώ. Ἐθυμώθη δὲ Ἰακὼβ τῇ Ῥαχὴλ, καὶ 2
εἶπεν αὐτῇ· μὴ ἀντὶ τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐγώ εἰμι, ὃς ἐστέρησέ σε καρπὸν
κοιλίας; Εἶπε δὲ Ῥαχὴλ τῷ Ἰακώβ· Ἰδοὺ ἡ παιδίσκη μου Βαλλὰ· 3
εἴσελθε πρὸς αὐτήν, καὶ τέξεται ἐπὶ τῶν γονάτων μου, ἵνα τεκνοποιήσωμαι
κἀγὼ ἐξ αὐτῆς. Καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ Βαλλὰν τὴν παι- 4
δίσκην αὐτῆς αὐτῷ γυναῖκα· καὶ εἰσῆλθε πρὸς αὐτὴν Ἰακώβ. Καὶ 5
συνέλαβε Βαλλὰ ἡ παιδίσκη Ῥαχὴλ, καὶ ἔτεκε τῷ Ἰακὼβ υἱόν.
Καὶ εἶπε Ῥαχὴλ· Ἔκρινέ μοι ὁ Θεός, καὶ ἐπήκουσε τῆς φωνῆς μου, 6
καὶ ἔδωκέ μοι υἱόν· διὰ τοῦτο ἐκάλεσε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ, Δάν. Καὶ 7
συνέλαβεν ἔτι Βαλλὰ ἡ παιδίσκη Ῥαχὴλ, καὶ ἔτεκεν υἱὸν δεύτερον
τῷ Ἰακώβ. Καὶ εἶπε Ῥαχὴλ· συνελάβετό μοι ὁ Θεός, καὶ συνανεστράφην 8
τῇ ἀδελφῇ μου, καὶ ἠδυνάσθην· καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ, 9
Νεφθαλεί. Ἴδε δὲ Λεία ὅτι ἔστη τοῦ τίκτειν, καὶ ἔλαβε Ζελφᾶν
τὴν παιδίσκην αὐτῆς, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὴν τῷ Ἰακὼβ γυναῖκα.
(Εἰσῆλθε δὲ πρὸς αὐτὴν Ἰακώβ,) καὶ συνέλαβε Ζελφὰ ἡ παιδίσκη 10
Λείας, καὶ ἔτεκε τῷ Ἰακὼβ υἱόν. Καὶ εἶπε Λεία· ἐν τύχῃ· καὶ 11
ἐπωνόμασε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ, Γάδ. Καὶ συνέλαβεν ἔτι Ζελφὰ ἡ 12

32 And Leah conceived, and bore a son unto Jacob; and she called his name Reuben, saying, "For the Lord hath looked upon my affliction, now therefore my husband will love me."

33 And she conceived again, Leah, and bore a second son unto Jacob; and she said, "Because the Lord hath heard that I am hated, He hath given me also this one." And she called his name Simeon.

34 And she conceived yet again, and bore a son; and she said, "Now at this time shall my husband be joined unto me, for I have borne him three sons." Therefore she called his name Levi.

**Chapter 30**

1 But when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and she said unto Jacob, "Give me children, or else I die."

2 And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel; and he said, "Am I in God's stead, Who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?"

3 And Rachel said unto Jacob, "Behold my maidservant Bilhah; go in unto her, that she may bear upon my knees, and I also may have children by her."

4 And she gave him Bilhah her maidservant to wife; and Jacob went in unto her.

5 And Bilhah, Rachel's maidservant, conceived and bore Jacob a son.

6 And Rachel said, "God hath judged my cause, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son." Therefore she called his name Dan.

7 And Bilhah, Rachel's maidservant, conceived again, and bore Jacob a second son.

8 And Rachel said, "God hath taken hold with me in my struggle, and I have contended with my sister, and I have prevailed." And she called his name Naphtali.

9 Now when Leah saw that she had ceased bearing, she took Zilpah her maidservant and gave her to Jacob to wife.

10 (And Jacob went in unto her,) and Zilpah, Leah's maidservant, conceived and bore Jacob a son.

11 And Leah said, "By good fortune!" And she called his name Gad.

12 And Zilpah, Leah's maidservant, conceived again, and bore Jacob a second son.
