11 ῏Ηταμ, καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς Σαμψὼν· οὐκ οἶδας ὅτι ἄρχουσιν ἡμῶν οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι; καὶ ἱνατὶ ταῦτα ἐποίησας ἡμῖν; Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς Σαμψὼν· καθὼς ἐποίησαν ἡμῖν, οὕτως ἐποιήσαμεν αὐτοῖς. 12 Καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῷ· τοῦ δῆσαί σε κατέβημεν, καὶ παραδοῦναί σε εἰς χείρας ἀλλοφύλων. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς Σαμψὼν· ὀμόσατέ μοι μὴ ἀποκτεῖναί με ὑμεῖς, καὶ παραδόσετέ με αὐτοῖς, μήποτε ἀπαντήσητε ὑμεῖς ἐν ἐμοί. 13 Καὶ ὤμοσαν αὐτῷ, λέγοντες· οὐχί, ἀλλὰ δεσμῷ δήσομέν σε, καὶ παραδώσομέν σε εἰς χείρας αὐτῶν, θανάτῳ δὲ οὐ θανατώσομέν σε. Καὶ ἔδησαν αὐτὸν ἐν δυσὶ καλῳδίοις καινοῖς, καὶ ἀνήγαγον αὐτὸν ἐκ τῆς πέτρας. 14 Καὶ αὐτὸς ἦλθεν ἕως σιαγόνος· καὶ οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι ἠλάλαξαν εἰς ἀπάντησιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔδραμον εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ κατήθυνεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν πνεῦμα Κυρίου, καὶ ἐγένοντο τὰ καλῴδια τὰ ἐν τοῖς βραχίοσιν αὐτοῦ ὡσεὶ στυππίον, ἡνίκα ἂν ὀσφρανθῇ πυρός· καὶ διελύθησαν οἱ δεσμοὶ ἀπὸ τῶν βραχιόνων αὐτοῦ. 15 Καὶ εὗρε σιαγόνα ὄνου ἐῤῥιμμένην (ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ), καὶ ἐξέτεινε τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔλαβεν αὐτήν· καὶ ἐπάταξεν ἐν αὐτῇ χιλίους ἄνδρας. 16 Καὶ εἶπε Σαμψὼν· ἐν σιαγόνι ὄνου ἐξαλείφων ἐξήλειψα αὐτούς, ὅτι ἐν σιαγόνι ὄνου ἐπάταξα χιλίους ἄνδρας. 17 Καὶ ἐγένετο ἡνίκα συνετέλεσε λαλῶν, καὶ ἔῤῥιψε τὴν σιαγόνα ἀπὸ τῆς χειρὸς αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸν τόπον ἐκεῖνον, ᾿Αναίρεσις σιαγόνος. 18 Καὶ ἐδίψησε σφόδρα, καὶ ἐβόησε πρὸς Κύριον, καὶ εἶπε· σὺ ἔδωκας ἐν χειρὶ τοῦ δούλου σου τὴν σωτηρίαν τὴν μεγάλην ταύτην, καὶ νῦν ἀποθανοῦμαι ἐν δίψει, καὶ ἐμπεσοῦμαι ἐν χειρὶ τῶν ἀπεριτμήτων; 19 Καὶ ἤνοιξεν ὁ Θεὸς τὸ τραῦμα τῆς σιαγόνος, καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ἐξ αὐτοῦ ὕδατα, καὶ ἔπιε· καὶ ἐπέστρεψε τὸ πνεῦμα αὐτοῦ ἐν αὐτῷ, καὶ ἀνέψυξε· διὰ τοῦτο ἐκλήθη τὸ ὄνομα τῆς πηγῆς, ᾿Επίκλητος σιαγόνος, ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης. 20 Καὶ ἔκρινε τὸν ᾿Ισραὴλ ἐν ἡμέραις ἀλλοφύλων ἔτη εἴκοσι.

**ΚΕΦ. ΙΣ΄.**
1 ΚΑΙ ἐπορεύθη Σαμψὼν ἐκεῖθεν εἰς Γάζαν· καὶ ἴδεν ἐκεῖ γυναῖκα πόρνην, καὶ εἰσῆλθε πρὸς αὐτήν. 2 Καὶ ἀπηγγέλη τοῖς Γαζαίοις, λέγοντες· ἥκει Σαμψὼν ἐνταῦθα. Καὶ ἐκύκλωσαν καὶ ἐνηδρεύσαν αὐτὸν ὅλην τὴν νύκτα ἐπὶ τῆς πύλης τῆς πόλεως,

### Judges Chapter 15

**11.** Etam; and they said unto Samson, "Knowest thou not that the Philistines do rule over us? And wherefore hast thou done this unto us?" And Samson said unto them, "As they have done unto us, so have we done unto them."

**12.** And they said unto him, "To bind thee are we come down, and to deliver thee into the hands of the Philistines." And Samson said unto them, "Swear ye unto me that ye will not slay me yourselves, when ye deliver me unto them, lest ye yourselves set upon me."

**13.** And they sware unto him, saying, "No; but we will surely bind thee with bands, and deliver thee into their hands; but we will not surely put thee to death." And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock.

**14.** And he came even unto Jawbone. And the Philistines shouted against him, and ran to meet him. And the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him, and the cords that were upon his arms became as flax, when it is singed with fire; and his bonds were loosed from off his arms.

**15.** And he found a jawbone of an ass cast aside (in the way), and he put forth his hand, and took it; and he smote therewith a thousand men.

**16.** And Samson said, "With the jawbone of an ass, utterly wiping out, I have wiped them out; for with the jawbone of an ass have I smitten a thousand men."

**17.** And it came to pass, when he had finished speaking, that he cast away the jawbone from his hand; and he called that place, The Slaughter of Jawbone.

**18.** And he thirsted greatly, and cried unto the Lord, and said, "Thou hast given into the hand of Thy servant this great salvation, and now shall I die of thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?"

**19.** And God opened the wound of the jawbone, and there came forth waters therefrom, and he drank; and his spirit returned to him, and he revived. Therefore was the name of the spring called, The Invoked of Jawbone, unto this day.

**20.** And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.

### Judges Chapter 16

**1.** And Samson went thence to Gaza, and saw there an harlot woman, and went in unto her.
