42. And the family of the sons of Merari also were numbered, according to their families, and according to their ancestral houses,
43. from twenty and five years old and upward, even unto fifty years old, every one that entereth in to minister for the works of the tabernacle of testimony;
44. and the numbering of their [kinship] was, according to their families, and according to their ancestral houses, three thousand and two hundred.

46. All those that were numbered, whom Moses and Aaron and the princes [of the sons] of Israel numbered of the Levites,
47. according to their families, and according to their ancestral houses, from twenty and five years old and upward and even unto fifty years old, every one that entereth in for the work of all their service, and for the works that are borne in the tabernacle of testimony;
48. and the numbered of them were eight thousand five hundred and eighty.

CHAPTER V

2. Command the sons of Israel, that they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that hath a running issue, and every one that is unclean by reason of a dead body.
3. Both male and female shall ye put out; without the camp shall ye send them, that they defile not their camps, in the midst whereof I dwell among them.
4. And the sons of Israel did so, and put them out of the camp: as the Lord spake unto Moses, so did the sons of Israel.

5. And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
6. Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, When a man or woman shall commit any of all the sins of men, and shall act most faithlessly against the Lord, and that soul commit a trespass,
7. then shall he confess his sin which he hath committed,
