τοῦτο; Καὶ ἀνήταζον, καὶ ἐξεζήτουν, καὶ εἶπαν· Γεδεὼν ὁ υἱὸς
**30.** Ἰωὰς ἐποίησε τὸ πρᾶγμα τοῦτο. Καὶ εἶπαν οἱ ἄνδρες τῆς πόλεως
πρὸς Ἰωάς· ἐξάγαγε τὸν υἱόν σου, καὶ ἀποθανέτω, ὅτι κατέσκα-
ψε τὸ θυσιαστήριον τοῦ Βάαλ, καὶ ὅτι ἔκοψε τὸ ἄλσος τὸ ἐπ᾿ αὐ-
**31.** τῷ. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰωὰς πρὸς τοὺς ἄνδρας τοὺς ἑσταμένους ἐπ᾿ αὐ-
τόν· μὴ ὑμεῖς νῦν δικάζεσθε περὶ τοῦ Βάαλ; ἢ ὑμεῖς σώζετε αὐ-
τόν; ὃς ἀντεδίκησεν αὐτόν, ἀποθανεῖται ἕως πρωΐ. Εἰ ἔστι θεός,
**32.** αὐτὸς ἐκδικήσει αὐτόν, ὅτι κατέσκαψε τὸ θυσιαστήριον αὐτοῦ. Καὶ
ἐκάλεσεν αὐτὸ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ δικαστήριον τοῦ Βάαλ, λέγων·
δικαζέσθω ἐν αὐτῷ ὁ Βάαλ, ὅτι κατέσκαψε τὸ θυσιαστήριον αὐ-
**33.** τοῦ. Καὶ πᾶσα Μαδιὰμ καὶ Ἀμαλὴκ καὶ υἱοὶ ἀνατολῶν συνήχ-
θησαν ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό, καὶ διέβησαν, καὶ παρενέβαλον ἐν τῇ κοιλάδι
**34.** Ἰεζραήλ. Καὶ πνεῦμα Θεοῦ ἐνέδυσε τὸν Γεδεών, καὶ ἐσάλπισεν
**35.** ἐν κερατίνῃ· καὶ ἐβόησεν Ἀβιεζὲρ ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἀγγέλους
ἐξαπέστειλεν ἐν παντὶ Μανασσῇ, καὶ ἐβόησε καὶ αὐτὸς ὀπίσω αὐ-
τοῦ· καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν ἀγγέλους ἐν Ἀσήρ, καὶ ἐν Ζαβουλών, καὶ
**36.** ἐν Νεφθαλί, καὶ ἀνέβησαν εἰς ἀπάντησιν αὐτῶν. Καὶ εἶπε Γεδε-
ὼν πρὸς τὸν Θεόν· εἰ σώζεις ἐν τῇ χειρί μου τὸν Ἰσραήλ, ὃν
**37.** τρόπον ἐλάλησας, ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἀπερείδομαι τὸν πόκον τῶν ἐρίων ἐν
τῇ ἅλωνι· καὶ ἐὰν δρόσος γένηται ἐπὶ τὸν πόκον μόνον, καὶ ἐπὶ
πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν ξηρασία, καὶ γνώσομαι ὅτι σώζεις ἐν τῇ χειρί
**38.** μου τὸν Ἰσραήλ, ὃν τρόπον ἐλάλησας. Καὶ ἐγένετο οὕτως· καὶ
ὥρθρισε Γεδεὼν τῇ ἐπαύριον, καὶ ἀπεπίασε τὸν πόκον, καὶ ἀπερ-
**39.** ρύη ἡ δρόσος ἐκ τοῦ πόκου, πλήρης λεκάνη ὕδατος. Καὶ εἶπε Γε-
δεὼν πρὸς τὸν Θεόν· μὴ ὀργισθήτω ὁ θυμός σου ἐν ἐμοί, καὶ λα-
λήσω (πρός σε) ἔτι ἅπαξ, καὶ πειράσω ἔτι ἅπαξ ἐν τῷ πόκῳ,
καὶ γενηθήτω ξηρασία ἐπὶ τὸν πόκον μόνον, ἐπὶ δὲ πᾶσαν τὴν
**40.** γῆν γενηθήτω δρόσος. Καὶ ἐποίησεν ὁ Θεὸς οὕτως ἐν τῇ νυκτὶ
ἐκείνῃ· καὶ ἐγένετο ξηρασία ἐπὶ τὸν πόκον μόνον, ἐπὶ δὲ πᾶσαν
τὴν γῆν ἐγένετο δρόσος.

ΚΕΦ. Ζʹ. VII.

**1.** Καὶ ὥρθρισεν Ἱεροβάαλ, (αὐτὸς ἔστι Γεδεών,) καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς
ὁ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ παρενέβαλεν ἐπὶ πηγὴν Ἰαέρ· καὶ παρεμβολὴ Μα-
διὰμ καὶ Ἀμαλὴκ ἦν αὐτῷ ἀπὸ βορρᾶ ἀπὸ τοῦ βουνοῦ τοῦ Μβωρέ

**JUDGES**
**CHAPTER 6.**

**29.** ...this? And they inquired, and sought diligently, and said, "Gideon, the son of Joash, hath done this thing."
**30.** Then the men of the city said unto Joash, "Bring forth thy son, that he may die; because he hath torn down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the Asherah that was by it."
**31.** And Joash said unto the men that stood against him, "Will ye now plead for Baal? Or will ye save him? Whosoever contendeth for him, let him die by the morning! If he be a god,
**32.** let him avenge himself, because [Gideon] hath torn down his altar." And he called it in that day, "The Judgment of Baal" [Jerubbaal], saying, "Let Baal defend his own cause therein, because he hath torn down his altar."
**33.** Now all Midian and Amalek and the children of the East were gathered together, and they passed over, and encamped in the valley of Jezreel.
**34.** And the Spirit of God clothed Gideon, and he blew the trumpet;
**35.** and Abiezer was summoned after him. And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh, and they also cried out after him; and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and
**36.** unto Naphtali; and they ascended to meet [the gathered forces]. And Gideon said unto God, "If Thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as Thou hast spoken,
**37.** behold, I will lay a fleece of wool upon the threshing-floor; and if dew be on the fleece only, and upon all the ground be dryness, then shall I know that Thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as Thou hast spoken."
**38.** And it was so; for Gideon rose up early on the morrow, and wrung out the fleece, and the dew ran out from the fleece, [a] basin full of water.
**39.** And Gideon said unto God, "Let not Thine anger be kindled against me, and I will speak (unto Thee) yet once more, and I will make trial yet once more with the fleece; and let there be dryness upon the fleece only, but upon all the ground let there be dew."
**40.** And God did so that night; and there was dryness upon the fleece only, but upon all the ground there was dew.

**CHAPTER 7.**

**1.** Then Jerubbaal (who is Gideon) rose up early, and all the people that were with him; and they pitched beside the spring of Iaêr. And the camp of Midian and Amalek was to him from the north, from the hill of Mbôré.
