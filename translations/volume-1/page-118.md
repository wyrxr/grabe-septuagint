λον τὸν λαόν μου, ἵνα ἑορτάσωσί μοι ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ. Καὶ εἶπε 2
Φαραώ· τίς ἐστι Κύριος οὗ εἰσακούσομαι τῆς φωνῆς αὐτοῦ, ὥστε
ἐξαποστεῖλαι τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραήλ; οὐκ οἶδα τὸν Κύριον, καὶ τὸν
Ἰσραὴλ οὐκ ἐξαποστελῶ. Καὶ λέγουσιν αὐτῷ· ὁ Θεὸς τῶν Ἑ- 3
βραίων προσκέκληται ἡμᾶς· πορευσόμεθα οὖν ὁδὸν τριῶν ἡμερῶν
εἰς τὴν ἔρημον, ὅπως θύσωμεν Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ ἡμῶν, μή ποτε
συναντήσῃ ἡμῖν θάνατος ἢ φόνος. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς ὁ βασιλεὺς 4
Αἰγύπτου· ἱνατί Μωυσῆ καὶ Ἀαρὼν διαστρέφετε τὸν λαόν (μου)
ἀπὸ τῶν ἔργων; ἀπέλθατε ἕκαστος ὑμῶν πρὸς τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ.
Καὶ εἶπε Φαραώ· ἰδοὺ νῦν πολυπληθεῖ ὁ λαὸς τῆς γῆς· μὴ οὖν 5
καταπαύσωμεν αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ τῶν ἔργων. Συνέταξε δὲ Φαραὼ τοῖς 6
ἐργοδιώκταις τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ τοῖς γραμματεῦσι, λέγων· οὐκέτι προ-
στεθήσεσθε διδόναι ἄχυρον τῷ λαῷ εἰς τὴν πλινθουργίαν, καθά-
περ ἐχθὲς καὶ τρίτην ἡμέραν (καὶ τὸ τῆς σήμερον)· αὐτοὶ πορευέ- 7
σθωσαν, καὶ συναγαγέτωσαν ἑαυτοῖς ἄχυρα. Καὶ τὴν σύνταξιν 8
τῆς πλινθουργίας, ἧς αὐτοὶ ποιοῦσι καθ᾿ ἑκάστην ἡμέραν, ἐπιβάλετε
αὐτοῖς, οὐκ ἀφελεῖς οὐδὲν ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν· σχολάζουσι γάρ·
διὰ τοῦτο αὐτοὶ κεκράγασι, λέγοντες· πορευθῶμεν, καὶ θύσωμεν
τῷ Θεῷ ἡμῶν. Βαρυνέσθω τὰ ἔργα τῶν ἀνθρώπων τούτων, καὶ 9
μεριμνάθωσαν ταῦτα, καὶ μὴ μεριμνάθωσαν ἐν λόγοις κενοῖς.
Κατέσπευδον δὲ αὐτοὺς οἱ ἐργοδιῶκται τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ οἱ γραμ- 10
ματεῖς, καὶ ἔλεγον πρὸς τὸν λαόν, λέγοντες· τάδε λέγει Φαραώ·
οὐκέτι δίδωμι ὑμῖν ἄχυρα· αὐτοὶ ὑμεῖς πορευόμενοι συλλέγετε 11
ἑαυτοῖς ἄχυρα, ὅθεν ἐὰν εὕρητε· οὐ γὰρ ἀφαιρεῖται ἀπὸ τῆς συν-
τάξεως ὑμῶν οὐδέν. Καὶ διεσπάρη δ᾽ ὁ λαὸς ἐν ὅλῃ γῇ Αἰγύπτω, 12
συναγαγεῖν καλάμην εἰς ἄχυρα. Οἱ δὲ ἐργοδιῶκται κατέσπευδον 13
αὐτούς, λέγοντες· συντελεῖτε τὰ ἔργα ὑμῶν τὰ καθήκοντα καθ᾿
ἡμέραν, καθάπερ καὶ ὅτε τὸ ἄχυρον ἐδίδοτο ὑμῖν. Καὶ ἐμαστι- 14
γώθησαν οἱ γραμματεῖς τοῦ γένους τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, οἱ κατα-
σταθέντες ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς ὑπὸ τῶν ἐπιστατῶν τοῦ Φαραώ, λέγοντες·
διατί οὐ συνετελέσατε τὰς συντάξεις ὑμῶν τῆς πλινθείας, καθά-
περ ἐχθὲς καὶ τρίτην ἡμέραν, καὶ τὸ τῆς σήμερον; Εἰσελ- 15
θόντες δὲ οἱ γραμματεῖς τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, κατεβόησαν πρὸς Φα-
ραώ, λέγοντες· ἱνατί οὕτω ποιεῖς τοῖς σοῖς οἰκέταις; ἄχυρον 16
οὐ δίδοται τοῖς οἰκέταις σου, καὶ τὴν πλίνθον ἡμῖν λέγουσι ποιεῖν,
καὶ ἰδοὺ οἱ παῖδές σου μεμαστίγωνται· ἀδικήσεις οὖν τὸν λαόν

*Correction Note for Verse 8: The text "ἐπιθάλετε" has been corrected to "ἐπιβάλετε." The original reading "ἐπιθάλετε" (from ἐπιθάλλω, meaning "to cause to sprout/flourish upon") renders the verse textually improbable within the context of imposing work quotas. The widely attested reading in Septuagint editions, including Grabe's 1707 edition (the basis for this reprint), is "ἐπιβάλετε" (from ἐπιβάλλω, meaning "to impose/lay upon"). This correction is made under the allowance for very clear OCR errors that create a textually improbable meaning.*

### Exodus Chapter 5

**1** [...my people,] that they may keep a feast unto Me in the wilderness.

**2** And Pharaoh said, Who is the Lord, whose voice I shall hearken unto, so as to let forth the sons of Israel? I know not the Lord, neither will I let forth Israel.

**3** And they say unto him, The God of the Hebrews hath called unto us; we will go, therefore, a journey of three days into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice unto the Lord our God, lest peradventure He meet us with death or with pestilence.

**4** And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, distract the people (My people) from their labours? Depart ye, every one of you, unto his own work.

**5** And Pharaoh said, Behold, now the people of the land are multiplied; so let us not cause them to rest from their labours.

**6** And Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their scribes, saying,

**7** Ye shall no more add to give straw unto the people for the brick-making, as ye did yesterday and the day before yesterday (and that which ye did today); let them themselves go, and gather for themselves straw.

**8** And the tale of brick-making, which they make each day, impose ye upon them; ye shall abate nothing from it. For they are idle; wherefore they have cried out, saying, Let us go, and sacrifice unto our God.

**9** Let the labours of these men be made heavy, and let them be anxious about these things, and let them not be concerned with vain words.

**10** And the taskmasters of the people and the scribes hastened them, and spoke unto the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh:

**11** I give you no more straw; ye yourselves going, gather for yourselves straw, wheresoever ye may find it. For nothing shall be diminished from your appointed tale.

**12** And so the people were scattered abroad through all the land of Egypt, to gather stubble for straw.

**13** And the taskmasters urged them on, saying, Complete ye your works, those due each day, even as when the straw was given unto you.

**14** And the scribes of the tribe of the sons of Israel were scourged, even those who were appointed over them by the overseers of Pharaoh, who said, Wherefore have ye not completed your appointed tale of brick-making, as yesterday and the day before yesterday, and that of today?

**15** And the scribes of the sons of Israel went in, and cried out unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore doest thou thus unto thy servants?

**16** Straw is not given unto thy servants, and they tell us to make the bricks; and behold, thy servants have been scourged. Thou wilt therefore wrong the people—
