ἡ καρδία Φαραώ, τοῦ μὴ ἐξαποστεῖλαι τὸν λαόν. Βάδισον πρὸς 15
Φαραὼ τὸ πρωΐ· ἰδοὺ αὐτὸς ἐκπορεύεται ἐπὶ τὸ ὕδωρ, καὶ στήσῃ
συναντῶν αὐτῷ ἐπὶ τὸ χεῖλος τοῦ ποταμοῦ, καὶ τὴν ῥάβδον τὴν
στραφεῖσαν εἰς ὄφιν λήψῃ ἐν τῇ χειρί σου. Καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτόν· 16
Κύριος ὁ θεὸς τῶν Ἑβραίων ἀπέσταλκέ με πρός σε, λέγων· ἐ-
ξαπόστειλον τὸν λαόν μου, ἵνα μοι λατρεύσωσιν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ· καὶ
ἰδοὺ οὐκ εἰσήκουσας ἕως τούτου. Τάδε λέγει Κύριος· ἐν τούτῳ 17
γνώσῃ ὅτι ἐγὼ Κύριος· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ τύπτω τῇ ῥάβδῳ τῇ ἐν τῇ χει-
ρί μου ἐπὶ τὸ ὕδωρ τὸ ἐν τῷ ποταμῷ, καὶ μεταβαλεῖ εἰς αἷμα·
καὶ οἱ ἰχθύες οἱ ἐν τῷ ποταμῷ τελευτήσουσι, καὶ ἐποζέσει ὁ πο- 18
ταμός, καὶ οὐ δυνήσονται οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι πιεῖν ὕδωρ ἀπὸ τοῦ πο-
ταμοῦ. Εἶπε δὲ Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν· εἶπον Ἀαρὼν τῷ ἀδελφῷ 19
σου· λάβε τὴν ῥάβδον σου, καὶ ἔκτεινον τὴν χεῖρά σου ἐπὶ τὰ
ὕδατα Αἰγύπτου, καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς ποταμοὺς αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς διώ-
ρυγας αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ ἔλη αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπὶ πᾶν συνεστηκὸς ὕ-
δωρ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔσται αἷμα· καὶ ἐγένετο αἷμα ἐν πάσῃ γῇ Αἰγύ-
πτου, ἔν τε τοῖς ξύλοις καὶ ἐν τοῖς λίθοις. Καὶ ἐποίησαν οὕτω 20
Μωυσῆς καὶ Ἀαρών, καθάπερ ἐνετείλατο αὐτοῖς Κύριος· καὶ ἐ-
πάρας Ἀαρὼν τὴν ῥάβδον αὐτοῦ, ἐπάταξε τὸ ὕδωρ τὸ ἐν τῷ πο-
ταμῷ, ἐναντίον Φαραὼ καὶ ἐναντίον τῶν θεραπόντων αὐτοῦ· καὶ
μετέβαλε πᾶν τὸ ὕδωρ τὸ ἐν τῷ ποταμῷ εἰς αἷμα· καὶ οἱ ἰχθύες 21
οἱ ἐν τῷ ποταμῷ ἐτελεύτησαν, καὶ ἐπώζεσεν ὁ ποταμός, καὶ οὐκ
ἠδύναντο οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι πιεῖν ὕδωρ ἐκ τοῦ ποταμοῦ, καὶ ἦν τὸ αἷ-
μα ἐν πάσῃ γῇ Αἰγύπτου. Ἐποίησαν δὲ ὡσαύτως καὶ οἱ ἐπαοιδοὶ 22
τῶν Αἰγυπτίων ταῖς φαρμακίαις αὐτῶν· καὶ ἐσκληρύνθη ἡ καρδία
Φαραώ, καὶ οὐκ εἰσήκουσεν αὐτῶν, καθάπερ εἶπε Κύριος. Ἐπι- 23
στραφεὶς δὲ Φαραώ, εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ· καὶ οὐκ ἐπέ-
στησε τὸν νοῦν αὐτοῦ οὐδὲ ἐπὶ τούτῳ. Ὤρυξαν δὲ πάντες οἱ Αἰ- 24
γύπτιοι κύκλῳ τοῦ ποταμοῦ, ὥστε πιεῖν ὕδωρ· καὶ οὐκ ἠδύναντο
πιεῖν ὕδωρ ἀπὸ τοῦ ποταμοῦ. Καὶ ἀνεπληρώθησαν ἑπτὰ ἡμέραι, 25
μετὰ τὸ πατάξαι Κύριον τὸν ποταμόν.

EXODUS: CHAPTER 7

15 the heart of Pharaoh, that he would not send forth the people.
Go thou unto Pharaoh in the morning; behold, he goeth forth to the water, and thou shalt stand to meet him upon the bank of the river; and the rod which was turned into a serpent shalt thou take in thy hand.

16 And thou shalt say unto him:
“The Lord, the God of the Hebrews, hath sent me unto thee, saying, ‘Send forth My people, that they may worship Me in the wilderness.’ And, behold, thou hast not hearkened until now.

17 Thus saith the Lord: ‘By this thou shalt know that I am the Lord. Behold, I will smite with the rod that is in My hand upon the water that is in the river, and it shall be turned into blood.

18 And the fish that are in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall not be able to drink water from the river.’”

19 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying:
“Say unto Aaron thy brother, ‘Take thy rod, and stretch forth thy hand upon the waters of Egypt, and upon their rivers, and upon their canals, and upon their fens, and upon every gathering of their waters, and it shall be blood.’”

And blood came to be throughout all the land of Egypt, both in the wood and in the stones.

20 And Moses and Aaron did so, as the Lord commanded them; and Aaron lifted up his rod, and smote the water that was in the river, before Pharaoh and before his servants; and all the water that was in the river was turned into blood.

21 And the fish that were in the river died, and the river did stink, and the Egyptians could not drink water from the river; and the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt.

22 And the enchanters of the Egyptians did likewise with their sorceries; and the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them, as the Lord had spoken.

23 And Pharaoh turned himself about, and went into his house; and he set not his mind even upon this.

24 And all the Egyptians dug round about the river, [to the end that they might] drink water; but they could not drink water from the river.

25 And seven days were fulfilled, after the Lord had smitten the river.

1 And the Lord spake unto Moses:
“Go in unto Pharaoh, and thou shalt say unto him, ‘Thus saith the Lord, “Send forth My people, that…”’”
