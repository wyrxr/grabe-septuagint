ΚΕΦ. ΚΑ΄. ΚΒ΄. ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ 33
στῆθι, (καὶ) λάβε τὸ παιδίον, καὶ κράτησον τῇ χειρί σου αὐτό· εἰς
γὰρ ἔθνος μέγα ποιήσω αὐτόν. Καὶ ἀνέῳξεν ὁ Θεὸς τοὺς ὀφθαλ- 19
μοὺς αὐτῆς, καὶ εἶδε φρέαρ ὕδατος ζῶντος· καὶ ἐπορεύθη, καὶ ἔ-
πλησε τὸν ἀσκὸν ὕδατος, καὶ ἐπότισε τὸ παιδίον. Καὶ ἦν ὁ Θεὸς 20
μετὰ τοῦ παιδίου, καὶ ηὐξήθη, καὶ κατώκησεν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ· ἐγέ-
νετο δὲ τοξότης. Καὶ κατώκησεν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ τῇ Φαράν· καὶ 21
ἔλαβεν αὐτῷ ἡ μήτηρ γυναῖκα ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου. Ἐγένετο δὲ ἐν 22
τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ, καὶ εἶπεν Ἀβιμέλεχ, καὶ Ὀχοζὰθ ὁ νυμφαγω-
γὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ Φιχὸλ ὁ ἀρχιστράτηγος τῆς δυνάμεως αὐτοῦ
πρὸς Ἀβραάμ, λέγων· ὁ Θεὸς μετὰ σοῦ ἐν πᾶσιν, οἷς ἐὰν ποιῇς·
νῦν οὖν ὄμοσόν μοι τὸν Θεόν, μὴ ἀδικήσειν με, μηδὲ τὸ σπέρμα 23
μου, μηδὲ τὸ ὄνομά μου· ἀλλὰ κατὰ τὴν δικαιοσύνην ἣν ἐποίησα
μετὰ σοῦ, ποιήσεις μετ’ ἐμοῦ, καὶ τῇ γῇ ᾗ σὺ παρῴκησας ἐν αὐ-
τῇ. 24 Καὶ εἶπεν Ἀβραάμ· ἐγὼ ὀμοῦμαι. Καὶ ἤλεγξεν Ἀβραὰμ 25
τὸν Ἀβιμέλεχ περὶ τῶν φρεάτων τοῦ ὕδατος, ὧν ἀφείλαντο οἱ παῖ-
δες τοῦ Ἀβιμέλεχ. Καὶ εἶπεν (αὐτῷ) Ἀβιμέλεχ· οὐκ ἔγνων τίς 26
ἐποίησε τὸ πρᾶγμα τοῦτο· οὐδὲ σύ μοι ἀπήγγειλας, οὐδὲ ἐγὼ ἤ-
κουσα, ἀλλὰ σήμερον. Καὶ ἔλαβεν Ἀβραὰμ πρόβατα καὶ μόσχους, 27
καὶ ἔδωκε τῷ Ἀβιμέλεχ· καὶ διέθεντο ἀμφότεροι διαθήκην. Καὶ 28
ἔστησεν Ἀβραὰμ ἑπτὰ ἀμνάδας προβάτων μόνας. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἀβι- 29
μέλεχ τῷ Ἀβραάμ· τί εἰσιν αἱ ἑπτὰ ἀμνάδες τῶν προβάτων τού-
των, ἃς ἔστησας μόνας; Καὶ εἶπεν Ἀβραάμ· ὅτι τὰς ἑπτὰ ἀ- 30
μνάδας ταύτας λήψῃ παρ’ ἐμοῦ, ἵνα ὦσί μοι εἰς μαρτύριον, ὅτι
ἐγὼ ὤρυξα τὸ φρέαρ τοῦτο. Διὰ τοῦτο ἐπωνόμασε τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ 31
τόπου ἐκείνου, φρέαρ ὁρκισμοῦ· ὅτι ἐκεῖ ὤμοσαν ἀμφότεροι· καὶ 32
διέθεντο διαθήκην ἐν τῷ φρέατι τοῦ ὅρκου. Ἀνέστη δὲ Ἀβιμέλεχ
καὶ Ὀχοζὰθ ὁ νυμφαγωγὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ Φιχὸλ ὁ ἀρχιστράτηγος
τῆς δυνάμεως αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν εἰς τὴν γῆν τῶν Φυλιστιείμ.
Καὶ ἐφύτευσεν Ἀβραὰμ ἄρουραν ἐπὶ τῷ φρέατι τοῦ ὅρκου, καὶ 33
ἐπεκαλέσατο ἐκεῖ τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου, Θεὸς αἰώνιος. Παρῴκησε δὲ 34
Ἀβραὰμ ἐν τῇ γῇ τῶν Φυλιστιείμ ἡμέρας πολλὰς.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΒ΄. XXII.

ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο μετὰ τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα, ὁ Θεὸς ἐπείρασε τὸν 1
Ἀβραάμ, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτόν· Ἀβραάμ, Ἀβραάμ. Ὁ δὲ εἶπεν·

## Genesis

### Chapter Twenty-one. Chapter Twenty-two.

**18** Arise, (and) take the child, and hold him by thy hand;
for of him will I make a great nation.
**19** And God opened her eyes, and she beheld a well of living water;
and she went, and filled the skin-bottle with water,
and gave the child to drink.
**20** And God was with the child; and he grew,
and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.
**21** And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran;
and his mother took him a wife from the land of Egypt.

**22** And it came to pass at that time,
that Abimelech, and Ochozath his companion,
and Phichol the chief captain of his army,
spake unto Abraham, saying:
"God is with thee in all that thou doest.
**23** Now therefore swear unto me by God,
that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my offspring,
nor with my name;
but according to the lovingkindness which I have shown unto thee,
shalt thou do unto me, and unto the land wherein thou hast sojourned."
**24** And Abraham said, "I will swear."
**25** And Abraham reproved Abimelech concerning the wells of water,
which Abimelech's servants had seized.
**26** And Abimelech said (unto him),
"I know not who hath done this thing;
neither didst thou tell me, neither did I hear of it,
until this day."
**27** And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech;
and both of them made a covenant.
**28** And Abraham set apart seven ewe-lambs of the flock by themselves.
**29** And Abimelech said unto Abraham,
"What mean these seven ewe-lambs of the flock,
which thou hast set apart by themselves?"
**30** And Abraham said,
"For these seven ewe-lambs shalt thou receive from my hand,
that they may be a witness unto me, that I have dug this well."
**31** Therefore he called the name of that place, the Well of the Oath;
because there both of them swore.
**32** And they made a covenant at the Well of the Oath.
Then Abimelech rose up, and Ochozath his companion,
and Phichol the chief captain of his army,
and they returned unto the land of the Philistines.
**33** And Abraham planted a grove upon the Well of the Oath,
and called there upon the Name of the Lord, the Eternal God.
**34** And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days.

### Chapter Twenty-two.

**1** And it came to pass after these things,
that God did test Abraham, and said unto him,
"Abraham, Abraham." And he said, "Behold, here am I."
