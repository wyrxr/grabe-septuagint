ΚΕΦ. ΚΖ΄. ΚΗ΄.                      ΓΕΝΕ             47
ὑπελίπου μοι εὐλογίαν, πάτερ; Ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ Ἰσαάκ, εἶπε τῷ 37
Ἡσαῦ· εἰ κύριον αὐτὸν ἐποίησά σου, καὶ πάντας τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς
αὐτοῦ ἐποίησα αὐτοῦ οἰκέτας, σίτῳ καὶ οἴνῳ ἐστήριξα αὐτόν, σοὶ
δὲ τί ποιήσω, τέκνον; Εἶπε δὲ Ἡσαῦ πρὸς Ἰσαάκ τὸν πατέρα 38
αὐτοῦ· μὴ εὐλογία μία σοι ἔστι, πάτερ; εὐλόγησον δὴ κἀμὲ πάτερ.
Κατανυχθέντος δὲ Ἰσαάκ, ἀνεβόησε φωνὴ Ἡσαῦ, καὶ ἔκλαυσεν.
Ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ Ἰσαάκ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ, εἶπεν αὐτῷ· ἰδοὺ ἀπὸ 39
τῆς πιότητος τῆς γῆς ἔσται ἡ κατοίκησίς σου, καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς δρό-
σου τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ἄνωθεν· καὶ ἐπὶ τῇ μαχαίρᾳ σου ζήσῃ, καὶ τῷ 40
ἀδελφῷ σου δουλεύσεις· ἔσται δὲ ἡνίκα ἐὰν καθέλῃς καὶ ἐκλύσῃς
τὸν ζυγὸν αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τοῦ τραχήλου σου. Καὶ ἐνεκότει Ἡσαῦ τῷ 41
Ἰακὼβ περὶ τῆς εὐλογίας, ἧς εὐλόγησεν αὐτὸν ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ.
Εἶπε δὲ Ἡσαῦ ἐν τῇ διανοίᾳ αὐτοῦ· ἐγγισάτωσαν αἱ ἡμέραι τοῦ
πένθους τοῦ πατρός μου, ἵνα ἀποκτείνω Ἰακὼβ τὸν ἀδελφόν μου.
Ἀπηγγέλη δὲ τῇ Ῥεβέκκᾳ τὰ ῥήματα Ἡσαῦ τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτῆς τοῦ 42
πρεσβυτέρου· καὶ πέμψασα ἐκάλεσεν Ἰακὼβ τὸν υἱὸν αὐτῆς τὸν
νεώτερον, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· ἰδοὺ Ἡσαῦ ὁ ἀδελφός σου ἀπειλεῖ σοι,
τοῦ ἀποκτεῖναί σε. Νῦν οὖν τέκνον, ἄκουσόν μου τῆς φωνῆς, καὶ 43
ἀναστὰς ἀπόδραθι (εἰς τὴν Μεσοποταμίαν) πρὸς Λάβαν τὸν ἀδελ-
φόν μου εἰς Χαρράν· καὶ οἴκησον μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἡμέρας τινάς, ἕως 44
τοῦ ἀποστρέψαι τὸν θυμὸν καὶ τὴν ὀργὴν τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου ἀπὸ 45
σοῦ, καὶ ἐπιλάθηται ἃ πεποίηκας αὐτῷ· καὶ ἀποστείλασα μετα-
πέμψομαί σε ἐκεῖθεν, μή ποτε ἀτεκνωθῶ ἀπὸ τῶν δύο ὑμῶν ἐν
ἡμέρᾳ μιᾷ. Εἶπε δὲ Ῥεβέκκα πρὸς Ἰσαάκ· προσώχθισα τῇ ζωῇ 46
μου διὰ τὰς θυγατέρας τῶν υἱῶν Χέτ· εἰ λήψεται Ἰακὼβ γυ-
ναῖκα ἀπὸ τῶν θυγατέρων τῆς γῆς ταύτης, ἵνα τί μοι τὸ ζῆν;
.
                   ΚΕΦ. ΚΗ΄. XXVIII.
Προσκαλεσάμενος δὲ Ἰσαάκ τὸν Ἰακὼβ, εὐλόγησεν αὐτὸν, 1
καὶ ἐνετείλατο αὐτῷ, λέγων· οὐ λήψῃ γυναῖκα ἐκ τῶν θυγατέρων
Χαναάν. Ἀναστὰς ἀπόδραθι εἰς τὴν Μεσοποταμίαν Συρίας, εἰς τὸν 2
οἶκον Βαθουὴλ τοῦ πατρὸς τῆς μητρός σου, καὶ λάβε σεαυτῷ ἐκεῖθεν
γυναῖκα ἐκ τῶν θυγατέρων Λάβαν τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ τῆς μητρός
σου. Ὁ δὲ Θεός μου εὐλογήσαι σε, καὶ αὐξῆσαι σε, καὶ πληθύναι 3
σε, καὶ ἔσῃ εἰς συναγωγὰς ἐθνῶν· καὶ δώῃ σοι τὴν εὐλογίαν 4

**Chapter 27**

37 "Hast thou not reserved for me a blessing, O father?"
Then Isaac answered and said unto Esau: "Behold, I have made him thy master, and all his brethren have I appointed his servants; with corn and with wine have I sustained him. And for thee, my son, what then shall I do?"

38 And Esau said unto Isaac his father: "Hast thou but one blessing, O father? Bless me, even me, O father!" And when Isaac's heart was pierced, Esau lifted up his voice and wept.

39 Then Isaac his father answered and said unto him: "Behold, thy dwelling shall be of the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above.
40 And by thy sword shalt thou live, and thy brother shalt thou serve; yet it shall be, when thou shalt cast down and break his yoke from off thy neck."

41 And Esau bore enmity against Jacob concerning the blessing wherewith his father had blessed him. And Esau said in his heart: "Let the days of my father's mourning draw nigh, that I may slay Jacob my brother."

42 And the words of Esau, her elder son, were reported unto Rebekah. And she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him: "Behold, Esau thy brother doth threaten thee, to slay thee.
43 Now therefore, my son, hearken unto my voice; and arise, flee (unto Mesopotamia) to Laban my brother, into Harran.
44 And sojourn with him certain days, until thy brother's wrath and his fury turn away from thee;
45 and he forget that which thou hast done unto him. Then will I send and fetch thee from thence, lest I be deprived of both of you in one day."

46 And Rebekah said unto Isaac: "I loathe my life because of the daughters of the sons of Heth. If Jacob shall take a wife of the daughters of this land, what profit is my life unto me?"

**Chapter 28**

1 Then Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, saying: "Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.
2 Arise, flee unto Mesopotamia of Syria, unto the house of Bethuel, the father of thy mother; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban, the brother of thy mother.
3 And may my God bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and mayest thou be a company of nations;
4 and may He give thee the blessing of Abraham my father, to thee and to thy seed after thee, to inherit the land of thy sojourning, which God hath given unto Abraham."
