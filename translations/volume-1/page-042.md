ΚΕΦ. ΙΗʹ. ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ 27
προβηκότες ἡμερῶν· ἐξέλιπε δὲ τῇ Σάρρᾳ γίνεσθαι τὰ γυναικεῖα.
Ἔγελασε δὲ Σάρρα ἐν ἑαυτῇ, λέγουσα· οὔπω μέν μοι γέγονεν ἕως 12
τοῦ νῦν· ὁ δὲ κύριός μου πρεσβύτερος. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Ἀ- 13
βραάμ· τί ὅτι ἐγέλασε Σάρρα ἐν ἑαυτῇ, λέγουσα· ἆρά γε ἀληθῶς
τέξομαι ; ἐγὼ δὲ γεγήρακα. Μὴ ἀδυνατήσει παρὰ τῷ Θεῷ ῥῆμα ; 14
εἰς τὸν καιρὸν τοῦτον ἀναστρέψω πρὸς σὲ εἰς ὥρας, καὶ ἔσται τῇ Σάρρᾳ υἱός. Ἤρνησατο δὲ Σάρρα, λέγουσα· οὐκ ἐγέλασα· 15
ἐφοβήθη γάρ. Καὶ εἶπεν· οὐχί, ἀλλὰ ἐγέλασας. Ἐξαναστάντες δὲ 16
ἐκεῖθεν οἱ ἄνδρες, κατέβλεψαν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον Σοδόμων καὶ Γομόρρας· Ἀβραὰμ δὲ συνεπορεύετο μετ᾽ αὐτῶν, συμπροπέμπων αὐτούς.
Ὁ δὲ Κύριος εἶπε· μὴ κρύψω ἐγὼ ἀπὸ Ἀβραὰμ τοῦ παιδός μου, 17
ἃ ἐγὼ ποιῶ ; Ἀβραὰμ δὲ γενόμενος ἔσται εἰς ἔθνος μέγα καὶ 18
πολύ, καὶ ἐνευλογηθήσονται ἐν αὐτῷ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη τῆς γῆς. Ἤδειν γὰρ ὅτι συντάξει τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ καὶ τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ μεθ᾽ 19
ἑαυτὸν, καὶ φυλάξουσι τὰς ὁδοὺς Κυρίου, ποιεῖν δικαιοσύνην καὶ
κρίσιν, ὅπως ἂν ἐπαγάγῃ Κύριος ἐπὶ Ἀβραὰμ πάντα ὅσα ἐλάλησεν ἐπ᾽ αὐτόν. Εἶπε δὲ Κύριος· κραυγὴ Σοδόμων καὶ Γομόρρας 20
πεπλήθυνται, καὶ αἱ ἁμαρτίαι αὐτῶν μεγάλαι σφόδρα. Καταβὰς 21
οὖν ὄψομαι, εἰ κατὰ τὴν κραυγὴν αὐτῶν τὴν ἐρχομένην πρός
με, συντελοῦνται· εἰ δὲ μὴ, ἵνα γνῶ. Καὶ ἀποστρέψαντες ἐκεῖθεν 22
οἱ ἄνδρες, ἦλθον εἰς Σόδομα· Ἀβραὰμ δὲ ἔτι ἦν ἑστηκὼς ἐναντίον Κυρίου. Καὶ ἐγγίσας Ἀβραὰμ, εἶπε· μὴ συναπολέσῃς δίκαιον 23
μετὰ ἀσεβοῦς, καὶ ἔσται ὁ δίκαιος ὡς ὁ ἀσεβής ; ἐὰν ὦσι πεντήκοντα 24
ἐν τῇ πόλει δίκαιοι, ἀπολεῖς αὐτούς ; οὐκ ἀφήσεις τὸν τόπον ἕνεκεν τῶν πεντήκοντα δικαίων, ἐὰν ὦσιν ἐν αὐτῇ ; Μηδαμῶς 25
σὺ ποιήσεις ὡς τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο, τοῦ ἀποκτεῖναι δίκαιον μετὰ ἀσεβοῦς, καὶ ἔσται ὁ δίκαιος ὡς ὁ ἀσεβής· μηδαμῶς. Ὁ κρίνων πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν, οὐ ποιήσεις κρίσιν ; Εἶπε δὲ Κύριος· ἐὰν εὑρεθῶσιν 26
ἐν Σοδόμοις πεντήκοντα δικαίους ἐν τῇ πόλει, ἀφήσω πάντα
τὸν τόπον δι᾽ αὐτούς. Καὶ ἀποκριθεὶς Ἀβραὰμ εἶπε· νῦν ἠρξάμην 27
λαλῆσαι πρὸς τὸν Κύριόν μου, ἐγὼ δὲ εἰμὶ γῆ καὶ σποδός· ἐὰν 28
δὲ ἐλαττωθῶσιν οἱ πεντήκοντα δίκαιοι πέντε, ἀπολεῖς ἕνεκεν τῶν
πέντε πᾶσαν τὴν πόλιν ; Καὶ εἶπεν· ὅτι οὐ μὴ ἀπολέσω, ἐὰν εὑρεθῶσιν ἐκεῖ τεσσαρακονταπέντε. Καὶ προσέθηκεν ἔτι λαλῆσαι πρὸς αὐτὸν, 29
καὶ εἶπεν· ἐὰν δὲ εὑρεθῶσιν ἐκεῖ τεσσαράκοντα ; καὶ εἶπεν·
οὐ μὴ ἀπολέσω ἕνεκεν τῶν τεσσαράκοντα. Καὶ εἶπε· μή τι Κύριε, 30

### Genesis Chapter 18

**11** being advanced in years; and it had ceased for Sarah to have the custom of women.

**12** And Sarah laughed within herself, saying, "Indeed, not yet hath it been unto me until now; and my lord is old."

**13** And the Lord said unto Abraham, "Wherefore hath Sarah laughed within herself, saying, 'Shall I indeed truly bear a child, I that am grown old?'

**14** Is any word impossible with God? At this appointed time I shall return unto thee, and Sarah shall have a son."

**15** But Sarah denied, saying, "I did not laugh"; for she was afraid. And He said, "Nay; but thou didst laugh."

**16** And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward the face of Sodom and Gomorrah; and Abraham went with them, accompanying them on their way.

**17** And the Lord said, "Shall I hide from Abraham my servant that which I do?

**18** For Abraham shall surely become a nation great and mighty, and in him shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.

**19** For I knew that he will command his sons and his house after him, and they shall keep the ways of the Lord, to do righteousness and judgment; that the Lord may bring upon Abraham all things whatsoever He hath spoken concerning him."

**20** And the Lord said, "The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah hath multiplied, and their sins are exceedingly great.

**21** I will go down now, and see whether they have brought [their iniquity] to completion according to the cry thereof which hath come unto Me; and if not, then I shall know."

**22** And the men turned away from thence, and came unto Sodom; but Abraham still stood before the Lord.

**23** And Abraham drew near, and said, "Wilt Thou destroy the righteous with the ungodly, and shall the righteous be as the ungodly?

**24** If there be fifty righteous in the city, wilt Thou destroy them? Wilt Thou not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous, if they be in it?

**25** By no means shalt Thou do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the ungodly, and that the righteous should be as the ungodly; by no means! He that judgeth all the earth, shall He not do judgment?"

**26** And the Lord said, "If there be found in Sodom fifty righteous [ones] in the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes."

**27** And Abraham answered and said, "Behold now, I have begun to speak unto my Lord, [I] who am but dust and ashes:

**28** If now the fifty righteous be diminished by five, wilt Thou destroy all the city for the sake of the five?" And He said, "I will not destroy [it], if there be found there forty and five."

**29** And he added yet to speak unto Him, and said, "What if there be found there forty?" And He said, "I will not destroy [it] for the sake of the forty."

**30** And he said, "Oh, let it not be [displeasing], O Lord,"
