Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν· ἔκτεινον τὴν χεῖρά σου, καὶ ἐπιλαβοῦ τῆς
κέρκου. Ἐκτείνας οὖν τὴν χεῖρα, ἐπελάβετο τῆς κέρκου, καὶ ἐγέ-
νετο ῥάβδος ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ· ἵνα πιστεύσωσι σοι, ὅτι ὤπταί 5
σοι Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τῶν πατέρων αὐτῶν, Θεὸς Ἀβραάμ, καὶ Θεὸς
Ἰσαάκ, καὶ Θεὸς Ἰακώβ. Εἶπε δὲ αὐτῷ Κύριος πάλιν· εἰσένεγ- 6
και τὴν χεῖρά σου εἰς τὸν κόλπον σου. Καὶ εἰσήνεγκε τὴν χεῖρα
αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸν κόλπον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐξήνεγκε τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἐκ
τοῦ κόλπου αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐγενήθη ἡ χεὶρ αὐτοῦ λεπρῶσα ὡσεὶ χιών.
Καὶ εἶπε· πάλιν εἰσένεγκαι τὴν χεῖρά σου εἰς τὸν κόλπον σου. 7
Καὶ εἰσήνεγκε τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸν κόλπον αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐξή-
νεγκεν αὐτὴν ἐκ τοῦ κόλπου αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάλιν ἀπεκατέστη εἰς τὴν
χρῶσιν τῆς σαρκὸς αὐτοῦ. Ἐὰν δὲ μὴ πιστεύσωσι σοι, μηδὲ εἰ- 8
σακούσωσι τῆς φωνῆς τοῦ σημείου τοῦ πρώτου, πιστεύσουσί σοι
τῆς φωνῆς τοῦ σημείου τοῦ ἐσχάτου. Καὶ ἔσται ἐὰν μὴ πιστεύ- 9
σωσι (σοι) τοῖς δυσὶ σημείοις τούτοις, μηδὲ εἰσακούσωσι τῆς φω-
νῆς σου, λήψῃ ἀπὸ τοῦ ὕδατος τοῦ ποταμοῦ, καὶ ἐκχεεῖς ἐπὶ τὸ
ξηρόν· καὶ ἔσται τὸ ὕδωρ, ὃ ἐὰν λάβῃς ἀπὸ τοῦ ποταμοῦ, αἷμα
ἐπὶ τοῦ ξηροῦ. Εἶπε δὲ Μωυσῆς πρὸς Κύριον· δέομαι Κύριε, οὐχ 10
ἱκανός εἰμι πρὸ τῆς ἐχθὲς καὶ πρὸ τῆς τρίτης ἡμέρας, οὐδὲ ἀφ᾽
οὗ ἤρξω λαλεῖν τῷ θεράποντί σου· ἰσχνόφωνος καὶ βραδύγλωσ-
σος ἐγώ εἰμι. Εἶπε δὲ Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν· τίς ἔδωκε στόμα 11
ἀνθρώπῳ, καὶ τίς ἐποίησε δύσκωφον, καὶ κωφόν, καὶ βλέποντα, καὶ
τυφλόν; οὐκ ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ Θεός; Καὶ νῦν πορεύου, καὶ ἐγὼ ἀ- 12
νοίξω τὸ στόμα σου, καὶ συμβιβάσω σε ἃ μέλλεις λαλῆσαι. Καὶ 13
εἶπε Μωυσῆς· δέομαι Κύριε, προχείρισαι ἄλλον δυνάμενον, ὃν ἀ-
ποστελεῖς. Καὶ θυμωθεὶς ὀργῇ Κύριος ἐπὶ Μωυσῆν, εἶπεν· οὐκ ἰδοὺ 14
Ἀαρὼν ὁ ἀδελφός σου ὁ Λευΐτης; Ἐπίσταμαι ὅτι λαλῶν λαλή-
σει αὐτὸς σοι· καὶ ἰδοὺ αὐτὸς ἐξελεύσεται εἰς συνάντησίν σοι, καὶ
ἰδών σε, χαρήσεται ἐν ἑαυτῷ. Καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτόν, καὶ δώσεις 15
τὰ ῥήματά μου εἰς τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐγὼ ἀνοίξω τὸ στόμα
σου καὶ τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ, καὶ συμβιβάσω ὑμᾶς ἃ ποιήσετε· καὶ 16
αὐτὸς σοι προσλαλήσει πρὸς τὸν λαόν, καὶ αὐτὸς ἔσται σου στό-
μα· σὺ δὲ αὐτῷ ἔσῃ τὰ πρὸς τὸν Θεόν. Καὶ τὴν ῥάβδον ταύτην 17
τὴν στραφεῖσαν εἰς ὄφιν, λήψῃ ἐν τῇ χειρί σου, ἐν ᾗ ποιήσεις ἐν
αὐτῇ τὰ σημεῖα. Ἐπορεύθη δὲ Μωυσῆς, καὶ ἐπέστρεψε πρὸς Ἰοθὸρ 18
τὸν γαμβρὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ λέγει αὐτῷ· πορεύσομαι, καὶ ἀποστρέ-

## EXODUS

### Chapter 4

**5** Then the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, "Stretch forth thine hand, and lay hold upon its tail." And he stretched forth his hand, and laid hold upon its tail; and it became a rod in his hand: that they may believe thee, that the Lord God of their fathers, even the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.
**6** And the Lord spake unto him again, saying, "Put now thine hand into thy bosom." And he put his hand into his bosom; and when he drew his hand forth out of his bosom, behold, his hand was become leprous, as white as snow.
**7** And He said, "Put thine hand again into thy bosom." And he put his hand into his bosom once more; and when he drew it forth from his bosom, behold, it was restored again unto the complexion of his [normal] flesh.
**8** And if they will not believe thee, neither hearken unto the voice of the first sign, then shall they believe thee by the voice of the latter sign.
**9** And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe [thee by] these two signs, nor hearken unto thy voice, then shalt thou take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry ground; and the water which thou shalt take from the river, it shall become blood upon the dry ground.
**10** And Moses said unto the Lord, "O my Lord, I am not a man of words, neither heretofore, nor since Thou hast spoken unto Thy servant; for I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue."
**11** And the Lord said unto Moses, "Who hath given a mouth to man? Or who maketh [him] hard of hearing, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Have not I, the Lord thy God?"
**12** "Now therefore go, and I will open thy mouth, and I will instruct thee what thou shalt speak."
**13** And Moses said, "O my Lord, I beseech Thee, appoint another able man, whom Thou wilt send."
**14** And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses, and He said, "Is not Aaron thy brother, the Levite? I know that he can speak well. And behold, he goeth forth to meet thee; and when he seeth thee, he shall be glad in his heart.
**15** And thou shalt speak unto him, and put My words in his mouth; and I will open thy mouth and his mouth, and will instruct you what ye shall do.
**16** And he shall speak for thee unto the people; and he shall be to thee as a mouth, and thou shalt be to him as God.
**17** And this rod, which was turned into a serpent, thou shalt take in thine hand; with it shalt thou perform the signs."
**18** And Moses departed, and returned unto Iothor his father-in-law, and said unto him, "I will go, and return..."
