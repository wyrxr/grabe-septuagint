106 ΕΞΟΔΟΣ ΚΕΦ. ς΄. Ζ΄.
29 ῥά ἐλάλησε Κύριος Μωσῇ ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ, καὶ ἐλάλησε Κύριος
πρὸς Μωσῆν, λέγων· ἐγὼ Κύριος· λάλησον πρὸς Φαραὼ βασι-
30 λέα Αἰγύπτου ὅσα ἐγὼ λέγω πρὸς σε. Καὶ εἶπε Μωσῆς ἐναν-
τίον Κυρίου· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἰσχνόφωνος εἰμι, καὶ πῶς εἰσακούσεταί μου
Φαραώ;

ΚΕΦ. Ζ΄. VII.

1 ΚΑΙ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Μωσῆν, λέγων· Ἰδοὺ δέδωκά σε
Θεὸν Φαραὼ, καὶ Ἀαρὼν ὁ ἀδελφός σου ἔσται σου προφήτης·
2 σὺ δὲ λαλήσεις αὐτῷ πάντα ὅσα σοι ἐντέλλομαι· ὁ δὲ Ἀαρὼν
ὁ ἀδελφός σου λαλήσει πρὸς Φαραὼ, ὥστε ἐξαποστεῖλαι τοὺς
3 υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ ἐκ τῆς γῆς αὐτοῦ. Ἐγὼ δὲ σκληρυνῶ τὴν καρδίαν
Φαραὼ, καὶ πληθυνῶ τὰ σημεῖά μου, καὶ τὰ τέρατά μου ἐν γῇ Αἰ-
4 γύπτῳ· καὶ οὐκ εἰσακούσεται ὑμῶν Φαραὼ· καὶ ἐπιβαλῶ τὴν χει-
ρά μου ἐπ᾿ Αἴγυπτον, καὶ ἐξάξω σὺν δυνάμει μου τὸν λαόν μου
5 τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου σὺν ἐκδικήσει μεγάλῃ· καὶ
γνώσονται πάντες οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι, ὅτι ἐγὼ εἰμι Κύριος, ἐκτείνων
τὴν χειρά μου ἐπ᾿ Αἴγυπτον, καὶ ἐξάξω τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ ἐκ
6 μέσου αὐτῶν. Ἐποίησε δὲ Μωσῆς καὶ Ἀαρὼν καθάπερ ἐνετεί-
7 λατο αὐτοῖς Κύριος, οὕτως ἐποίησαν. Μωσῆς δὲ ἦν ἐτῶν ὀγδοή-
κοντα, Ἀαρὼν δὲ (ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ) ὀγδοηκοντατριῶν ἐτῶν ἦν, ἡνίκα
8 ἐλάλησαν πρὸς Φαραώ. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Μωσῆν καὶ Ἀα-
9 ρὼν, λέγων· καὶ ἐὰν λαλήσῃ πρὸς ὑμᾶς Φαραὼ, λέγων· δότε
ἡμῖν σημεῖον ἢ τέρας, καὶ ἐρεῖς Ἀαρὼν τῷ ἀδελφῷ σου· λάβε
τὴν ῥάβδον, καὶ ῥίψον αὐτὴν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ἐναντίον Φαραὼ, καὶ ἐ-
10 ναντίον τῶν θεραπόντων αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔσται δράκων. Εἰσῆλθε δὲ
Μωσῆς καὶ Ἀαρὼν ἐναντίον Φαραὼ καὶ τῶν θεραπόντων αὐτοῦ,
καὶ ἐποίησαν οὕτω, καθάπερ ἐνετείλατο αὐτοῖς Κύριος· καὶ ἐξέῤῥιψεν Ἀαρὼν τὴν ῥάβδον αὐτοῦ ἐναντίον Φαραὼ καὶ ἐναντίον τῶν
11 θεραπόντων αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐγένετο δράκων. Συνεκάλεσε δὲ Φαραὼ
τοὺς σοφιστὰς Αἰγύπτου καὶ τοὺς φαρμακοὺς, καὶ ἐποίησαν καὶ
12 οἱ ἐπαοιδοὶ τῶν Αἰγυπτίων ταῖς φαρμακίαις αὐτῶν ὡσαύτως· καὶ
ἐξέῤῥιψαν ἕκαστος τὴν ῥάβδον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐγένοντο δράκοντες· καὶ
13 κατέπιεν ἡ ῥάβδος ἡ Ἀαρὼν τὰς ἐκείνων ῥάβδους. Καὶ κατίσχυσεν ἡ καρδία Φαραὼ, καὶ οὐκ εἰσήκουσεν αὐτῶν, καθάπερ ἐλά-
14 λησεν αὐτοῖς Κύριος. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Μωσῆν· βεβάρηται

### Exodus
#### Chapter 6

29 Ra spoke the Lord unto Moses in the land of Egypt, and the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, I am the Lord. Speak thou unto Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, all that I speak unto thee.
30 And Moses said before the Lord, Behold, I am slow of speech, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?

#### Chapter 7

1 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, Behold, I have made thee as God unto Pharaoh, and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.
2 Thou shalt speak unto him all that I command thee; and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he may send forth the children of Israel out of his land.
3 And I will harden the heart of Pharaoh, and I will multiply My signs and My wonders in the land of Egypt.
4 And Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you; and I will lay My hand upon Egypt, and I will bring forth My people, the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt with My great power and with great vengeance.
5 And all the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, when I stretch forth My hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from the midst of them.
6 And Moses and Aaron did as the Lord commanded them; thus they did.
7 Now Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron (his brother) was eighty-three years old, when they spoke unto Pharaoh.

8 And the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
9 When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Show us a sign or a wonder, then thou shalt say unto Aaron thy brother, Take thy rod, and cast it down upon the earth before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it shall become a dragon.
10 And Moses and Aaron went in before Pharaoh and before his servants, and they did so, just as the Lord had commanded them. And Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a dragon.
11 Then Pharaoh summoned the wise men of Egypt and the sorcerers; and the enchanters of Egypt also did likewise with their enchantments.
12 For they cast down every man his rod, and they became dragons; but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.
13 And the heart of Pharaoh was strengthened, and he hearkened not unto them, just as the Lord had spoken unto them.
14 And the Lord said unto Moses, The heart of Pharaoh is heavy, [and hardened].
