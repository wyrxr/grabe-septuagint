λατρεύσητε θεοῖς ἀλλοτρίοις, καὶ ἐπελθὼν κακώσει ὑμᾶς, καὶ ἐξαναλώσει
ὑμᾶς ἀνθ’ ὧν εὖ ἐποίησεν ὑμῖν. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ λαὸς πρὸς Ἰησοῦν· 21
οὐχί, ἀλλὰ τῷ Κυρίῳ λατρεύσομεν. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰησοῦς πρὸς τὸν 22
λαόν· μάρτυρες ὑμεῖς καθ’ ὑμῶν, ὅτι ὑμεῖς ἐξελέξασθε ὑμῖν τὸν Κύριον,
λατρεύειν αὐτῷ. Καὶ εἶπαν· μάρτυρες. Καὶ νῦν περιέλεσθε τοὺς θεοὺς 23
τοὺς ἀλλοτρίους τοὺς ἐν ὑμῖν, καὶ εὐθύνατε τὴν καρδίαν ὑμῶν πρὸς
Κύριον Θεὸν Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ λαὸς πρὸς Ἰησοῦν· Κυρίῳ τῷ 24
Θεῷ ἡμῶν λατρεύσομεν, καὶ τῆς φωνῆς αὐτοῦ ἀκουσόμεθα. Καὶ 25
διέθετο Ἰησοῦς διαθήκην πρὸς τὸν λαὸν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, καὶ
ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ νόμον καὶ κρίσιν ἐν Σηλὼ ἐνώπιον τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ
Θεοῦ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἔγραψεν Ἰησοῦς τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα εἰς βιβλίον, 26
νόμον τοῦ Θεοῦ· καὶ ἔλαβε λίθον μέγαν, καὶ ἔστησεν αὐτὸν Ἰησοῦς
ἐκεῖ ὑπὸ τὴν τερέβινθον τὴν ἀπέναντι Κυρίου. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰησοῦς 27
πρὸς πάντα τὸν λαόν· ἰδοὺ ὁ λίθος οὗτος ἔσται ἐν ἡμῖν εἰς
μαρτύριον, ὅτι οὗτος ἀκήκοε πάντα τὰ λεχθέντα ὑπὸ Κυρίου, ὅσα
ἐλάλησε πρὸς ὑμᾶς σήμερον, καὶ οὗτος ἔσται ἐν ὑμῖν εἰς μαρτύριον
ἐπ’ ἐσχάτων τῶν ἡμερῶν, ἡνίκα ἂν ψεύσησθε Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ
ὑμῶν. Καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν Ἰησοῦς τὸν λαόν, ἕκαστον εἰς τὸν 28
τόπον αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐλάτρευσεν Ἰσραὴλ τῷ Κυρίῳ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας 31
Ἰησοῦ καὶ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας τῶν πρεσβυτέρων, ὅσοι ἐφείλκυσαν
τὸν χρόνον μετὰ Ἰησοῦ, καὶ ὅσοι εἶδοσαν πάντα τὰ ἔργα
Κυρίου ὅσα ἐποίησε τῷ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἐγένετο μετ’ ἐκεῖνα καὶ 29
ἀπέθανεν Ἰησοῦς υἱὸς Ναυῆ δοῦλος Κυρίου, υἱὸς ἑκατὸν καὶ δέκα
ἐτῶν· καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν πρὸς τοῖς ὁρίοις τοῦ κλήρου αὐτοῦ ἐν Θαμναθ-σαράχ, 30
τῇ ἐν τῷ ὄρει Ἐφραὶμ ἀπὸ βορρᾶ τοῦ ὄρους Γαάς·
καὶ ἐκεῖ ἔθηκαν μετ’ αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸ μνημεῖον ἐν ᾧ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν
ἐκεῖ, τὰς μαχαίρας τὰς πετρίνας, ἐν αἷς περιέτεμε τοὺς υἱοὺς
Ἰσραὴλ ἐν Γαλγάλοις, ὅτε ἐξήγαγεν αὐτοὺς ἐξ Αἰγύπτου, καθὰ
συνέταξε Κύριος· καὶ ἐκεῖ εἰσιν ἕως τῆς σήμερον ἡμέρας. Καὶ τὰ 32
ὀστᾶ Ἰωσὴφ ἃ ἀνήγαγον οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐξ Αἰγύπτου, καὶ κατώρυξαν
αὐτὰ ἐν Σικίμοις ἐν τῇ μερίδι τοῦ ἀγροῦ, οὗ ἐκτήσατο Ἰακὼβ
παρὰ τῶν Ἀμοῤῥαίων τῶν κατοικούντων ἐν Σικίμοις ἀμνάδων
ἑκατόν, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὴν Ἰωσὴφ ἐν μερίδι. Καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ 33
ταῦτα, καὶ Ἐλεάζαρ ὁ υἱὸς Ἀαρὼν ὁ ἱερεὺς ἐτελεύτησε, καὶ ἐτάφη
ἐν Γαβαὰθ Φινεὲς τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ, ἣν ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ ἐν τῷ ὄρει
τῷ Ἐφραίμ.

**Joshua 24**
<sup>20</sup> ...serve strange gods, then He will come upon you and afflict you, and He will consume you, for all the good He hath done unto you."
<sup>21</sup> And the people answered Joshua, and they said, "Nay, but the LORD will we serve!"
<sup>22</sup> And Joshua said unto the people, "Ye are witnesses against yourselves, that ye yourselves have chosen the LORD for yourselves, to serve Him." And they said, "Witnesses [are we]."
<sup>23</sup> "Now therefore put away the strange gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel."
<sup>24</sup> And the people said unto Joshua, "The LORD our God will we serve, and unto His voice will we hearken."
<sup>25</sup> So Joshua made a covenant with the people on that day, and he gave them a statute and an ordinance in Shiloh before the tabernacle of the God of Israel.
<sup>26</sup> And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God; and he took a great stone, and set it up there beneath the terebinth that was before the LORD.
<sup>27</sup> And Joshua said unto all the people, "Behold, this stone shall be unto us for a witness, for it hath heard all the words which the LORD spake unto you this day; and this shall be unto you for a witness in the latter days, whensoever ye shall deal falsely with the LORD your God."
<sup>28</sup> So Joshua sent the people away, every man unto his own place.
<sup>31</sup> And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who prolonged their days after Joshua, and who had seen all the works of the LORD, which He had done for Israel.
<sup>29</sup> And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old.
<sup>30</sup> And they buried him within the borders of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which is in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the mount Gaash. And there they placed with him in the tomb, wherein they buried him there, the stone knives, with which he had circumcised the children of Israel in Gilgal, when he brought them out of Egypt, as the LORD had commanded; and they are there unto this day.
<sup>32</sup> And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, did they bury in Shechem, in a portion of the field which Jacob bought of the Amorites who dwelt in Shechem for an hundred lambs; and he gave it unto Joseph for a portion.
<sup>33</sup> And it came to pass after these things, that Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest died; and he was buried in Gibeath of Phinehas his son, which [land] he [Joshua] gave unto him in the mount of Ephraim.
