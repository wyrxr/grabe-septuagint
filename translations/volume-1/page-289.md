1 ΚΑΙ ἤκουσεν ὁ Χαναναῖος βασιλεὺς Ἀράδ, ὁ κατοικῶν κατὰ
τὴν ἔρημον, ὅτι ἦλθεν Ἰσραὴλ ὁδὸν Ἀθαρείμ, καὶ ἐπολέμησε πρὸς
2 Ἰσραήλ, καὶ κατεπρονόμευσαν ἐξ αὐτῶν αἰχμαλωσίαν. Καὶ ηὔξατο
Ἰσραὴλ εὐχὴν Κυρίῳ, καὶ εἶπεν· ἐάν μοι παραδῷς τὸν λαὸν τοῦ-
3 τον ὑποχείριον, ἀναθεματιῶ αὐτὸν καὶ τὰς πόλεις αὐτοῦ. Καὶ
εἰσήκουσε Κύριος τῆς φωνῆς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ παρέδωκε τὸν Χαναναῖον
ὑποχείριον αὐτῷ· καὶ ἀνεθεμάτισεν αὐτὸν καὶ τὰς πόλεις αὐτοῦ, καὶ
4 ἐπεκάλεσε τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ τόπου ἐκείνου, ἀνάθεμα. Καὶ ἀπάραν-
τες ἐξ Ὠρ τοῦ ὄρους ὁδὸν ἐπὶ θάλασσαν ἐρυθράν, περιεκύκλωσαν
5 τὴν γῆν Ἐδώμ· καὶ ὠλιγοψύχησεν ὁ λαὸς ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ. Καὶ κατελάλει
ὁ λαὸς πρὸς τὸν Θεὸν καὶ κατὰ Μωυσῆ, λέγοντες· ἵνατί ἐξηγά-
γετε ἡμᾶς ἐξ Αἰγύπτου, ἀποκτεῖναι ἡμᾶς ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ; ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν ἄρ-
6 τος, οὐδὲ ὕδωρ, ἡ δὲ ψυχὴ ἡμῶν προσώχθισεν ἐν τῷ ἄρτῳ τῷ διακένῳ
τούτῳ. Καὶ ἀπέστειλε Κύριος εἰς τὸν λαὸν τοὺς ὄφεις τοὺς θανατοῦντας,
7 καὶ ἔδακνον τὸν λαόν· καὶ ἀπέθανε λαὸς πολὺς τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ
παραγενόμενος ὁ λαὸς πρὸς Μωυσῆν, ἔλεγον· ὅτι ἡμαρτήκαμεν, ὅτι
κατελαλήσαμεν κατὰ τοῦ Κυρίου καὶ κατὰ σοῦ· εὔξαι οὖν πρὸς
Κύριον, καὶ ἀφελέτω ἀφ᾿ ἡμῶν τὸν ὄφιν. Καὶ ηὔξατο Μωυσῆς
8 πρὸς Κύριον περὶ τοῦ λαοῦ. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν· ποίη-
σον σεαυτῷ ὄφιν, καὶ θὲς αὐτὸν ἐπὶ σημείου· καὶ ἔσται, ἐὰν δάκῃ
9 ὄφις ἄνθρωπον, πᾶς ὁ δεδηγμένος ἰδὼν αὐτὸν ζήσεται. Καὶ ἐποί-
ησε Μωυσῆς ὄφιν χαλκοῦν, καὶ ἔστησεν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ σημείου· καὶ
ἐγένετο ὅταν ἔδακεν ὄφις ἄνθρωπον, καὶ ἐπέβλεψεν ἐπὶ τὸν ὄφιν
10 τὸν χαλκοῦν, καὶ ἔζη. Καὶ ἀπῆραν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ παρενέ-
11 βαλον ἐν Ὠβώθ. Καὶ ἐξάραντες ἐξ Ὠβώθ, παρενέβαλον ἐν Ἀχελ-
γαὶ τῷ πέραν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, ἥ ἐστι κατὰ πρόσωπον Μωάβ κατ᾿
12 ἀνατολὰς ἡλίου· ἐκεῖθεν ἀπῆραν, καὶ παρενέβαλον εἰς φάραγγα Ζα-
13 ρέδ. Καὶ ἐκεῖθεν ἀπάραντες, παρενέβαλον εἰς τὸ πέραν Ἀρνὼν δ᾿
ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, τὸ ἐξέχον ἀπὸ τῶν ὁρίων τῶν Ἀμοῤῥαίων· ἔστι
γὰρ Ἀρνὼν ὅρια Μωάβ ἀναμέσον Μωάβ καὶ ἀναμέσον τοῦ Ἀμοῤῥαίου.
14 Διὰ τοῦτο λέγεται ἐν βίβλῳ· πόλεμος Κυρίου τὴν Ζοὸβ
ἐρλόγισε, καὶ τοὺς χειμάῤῥους Ἀρνῶν, καὶ τοὺς χειμάῤῥους κατέστησε
15 κατοικῆσαι· Ἤρ· καὶ πρόσκειται τοῖς ὁρίοις Μωάβ. Καὶ

**Chapter XXI.**

1 And the Canaanite king of Arad,
who dwelt in the wilderness,
heard that Israel came by the way of Atharim;
and he fought against Israel,
and they took from them captives.
2 And Israel vowed a vow unto the Lord, and said,
“If Thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand,
then will I utterly destroy them and their cities.”
3 And the Lord hearkened unto the voice of Israel,
and delivered the Canaanite into his hand;
and he utterly destroyed them and their cities,
and he called the name of that place Anathema.

4 And they journeyed from Mount Hor
by the way of the Red Sea,
to compass the land of Edom;
and the spirit of the people was greatly discouraged on the way.
5 And the people spoke against God and against Moses, saying,
“Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt
to die in the wilderness?
For there is no bread, neither is there water;
and our soul loatheth this empty bread.”
6 And the Lord sent among the people
the deadly serpents, which bit the people;
and much people of the children of Israel died.
7 And the people came unto Moses, and said,
“We have sinned, for we have spoken against the Lord and against thee;
pray thou therefore unto the Lord,
that He may take away the serpent from us.”
And Moses prayed unto the Lord concerning the people.
8 And the Lord said unto Moses,
“Make thee a serpent, and set it upon a pole;
and it shall come to pass,
that every one that is bitten,
when he looketh upon it, shall live.”
9 And Moses made a serpent of bronze,
and set it upon a pole;
and it came to pass,
that if a serpent had bitten any man,
when he looked upon the bronze serpent, he lived.

10 And the children of Israel journeyed,
and encamped in Oboth.
11 And they journeyed from Oboth,
and encamped in Ije-abarim,
which is in the wilderness on the other side,
before Moab, toward the rising of the sun.
12 From thence they journeyed,
and encamped in the valley of Zared.
13 And from thence they journeyed,
and encamped on the other side of Arnon,
in the wilderness,
which cometh out of the borders of the Amorites:
for Arnon is the border of Moab,
between Moab and between the Amorite.
14 Therefore is it said in the book:
“The war of the Lord hath reckoned Zoob,
and the torrents of Arnon;
yea, the torrents hath He caused to dwell,
15 [Even] Ar; and it bordereth upon the borders of Moab.”
