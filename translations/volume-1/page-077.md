62 ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ ΚΕΦ. ΛΔ΄. ΛΕ΄.
καὶ ἐμπορευέσθωσαν αὐτήν· ἡ δὲ γῆ ἰδοὺ πλατεῖα ἐν χερσὶν ἐναντίον αὐτῶν· τὰς θυγατέρας αὐτῶν ληψόμεθα ἡμῖν γυναῖκας,
22 καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας ἡμῶν δώσομεν αὐτοῖς. Μόνον ἐν τούτῳ ὁμοιωθήσονται ἡμῖν οἱ ἄνθρωποι τοῦ κατοικεῖν μεθ᾿ ἡμῶν, ὥς τε εἶναι λαὸν ἕνα, ἐν τῷ περιτέμνεσθαι ἡμῶν πᾶν ἀρσενικόν, καθὸ καὶ αὐτοὶ περιτέτμηνται·
23 καὶ τὰ κτήνη αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ τετράποδα αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ ὑπάρχοντα αὐτῶν οὐχ ἡμῶν ἔσται; μόνον ἐν τούτῳ ὁμοιωθῶμεν αὐτοῖς, καὶ οἰκήσουσι μεθ᾿ ἡμῶν.
24 Καὶ εἰσήκουσαν Ἑμμὼρ καὶ Συχὲμ τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ πάντες οἱ ἐκπορευόμενοι τὴν πύλην τῆς πόλεως αὐτῶν, καὶ περιετέμοντο τὴν σάρκα τῆς ἀκροβυστίας αὐτῶν πᾶς ἄρσην, πάντες ἐξερχόμενοι πύλην πόλεως αὐτοῦ.
25 Ἐγένετο δὲ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τρίτῃ, ὅτε ἦσαν ἐν τῷ πόνῳ, ἔλαβον οἱ δύο υἱοὶ Ἰακὼβ Συμεὼν καὶ Λευί, ἀδελφοὶ Δείνας, ἕκαστος τὴν μάχαιραν αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἰσῆλθον εἰς τὴν πόλιν ἀσφαλῶς, καὶ ἀπέκτειναν πᾶν ἀρσενικὸν τόν τε Ἐμμὼρ καὶ τὸν Συχὲμ τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ ἀπέκτειναν ἐν στόματι μαχαίρας, καὶ ἔλαβον τὴν Δείναν ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ Συχὲμ καὶ ἐξῆλθον.
27 Οἱ δὲ υἱοὶ Ἰακὼβ εἰσῆλθον ἐπὶ τοὺς τραυματίας, καὶ διήρπασαν τὴν πόλιν, ἐν ᾗ ἐμίαναν Δείναν τὴν ἀδελφὴν αὐτῶν·
28 καὶ τὰ πρόβατα αὐτῶν καὶ τοὺς βόας αὐτῶν καὶ τοὺς ὄνους αὐτῶν, ὅσα τε ἦν ἐν τῇ πόλει, καὶ ὅσα ἦν ἐν τῷ
29 πεδίῳ, ἔλαβον· καὶ πάντα τὰ σώματα αὐτῶν καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν ἀποσκευὴν αὐτῶν καὶ τὰς γυναῖκας αὐτῶν ᾐχμαλώτευσαν, καὶ διήρπασαν ὅσα τε ἦν ἐν τῇ πόλει, καὶ ὅσα ἦν ἐν ταῖς οἰκίαις.
30 Εἶπε δὲ Ἰακὼβ πρὸς Συμεὼν καὶ Λευΐ· μισητόν με πεποιήκατε, ὥς τε πονηρόν με εἶναι πᾶσι τοῖς κατοικοῦσι πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν, ἔν τε τοῖς Χαναναίοις, καὶ ἐν τοῖς Φερεζαίοις· ἐγὼ δὲ ὀλιγοστός εἰμι ἐν ἀριθμῷ, καὶ συναχθέντες ἐπ᾿ ἐμέ, συγκρούσουσί με, καὶ ἐκτριβήσομαι ἐγὼ καὶ ὁ
31 οἶκός μου. Οἱ δὲ εἶπαν· ἀλλ᾿ ὡσεὶ πόρνῃ χρήσονται τῇ ἀδελφῇ ἡμῶν;

ΚΕΦ. ΛΕ΄. XXXV.

1 Εἶπε δὲ ὁ Θεὸς πρὸς Ἰακώβ· ἀναστὰς ἀνάβηθι εἰς (τὸν τόπον) Βαιθήλ, καὶ οἴκει ἐκεῖ, καὶ ποίησον ἐκεῖ θυσιαστήριον τῷ Θεῷ τῷ ὀφθέντι σοι, ἐν τῷ ἀποδιδράσκειν σε ἀπὸ προσώπου Ἡσαῦ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου.
2 Εἶπε δὲ Ἰακὼβ τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ· ἄρατε τοὺς θεοὺς τοὺς ἀλλοτρίους ἐκ μέσου ὑμῶν·

**GENESIS CHAPTER 34**

21 And let them trade in it; and behold, the land is wide before them. Their daughters shall we take unto us for wives,
22 and our daughters shall we give unto them. Only in this wise shall these men be made like unto us, to dwell with us, so that we may be one people: if every male among us be circumcised, even as they themselves are circumcised.
23 And shall not their cattle, and their beasts, and all their possessions, be ours? Only in this, let us be made like unto them, and they shall dwell with us.
24 And all they that went out of the gate of their city hearkened unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son; and they circumcised the flesh of their foreskin, every male, even all that went out of the gate of his city.
25 And it came to pass on the third day, when they were in their pain, that the two sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and entered into the city securely, and slew every male.
26 Yea, Hamor and Shechem his son they slew with the edge of the sword; and they took Dinah out of the house of Shechem, and departed.
27 And the sons of Jacob came upon the wounded, and plundered the city, wherein they had defiled Dinah their sister.
28 And their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, even all that was in the city, and all that was in the field, they took.
29 And all their persons, and all their spoils, and their women they took captive; and they plundered all that was in the city, and all that was in the houses.
30 Then Jacob said unto Simeon and Levi, "Ye have made me odious, so that I shall be grievous unto all them that dwell in this land, both among the Canaanites and among the Perizzites. For I am few in number, and they shall gather themselves against me, and they shall smite me; and I and my house shall be utterly destroyed."
31 And they said, "But shall they deal with our sister as with a harlot?"

**CHAPTER 35**

1 Then God said unto Jacob, "Arise, go up unto (the place) Bethel, and dwell there; and make there an altar unto God, who appeared unto thee when thou didst flee from the face of Esau thy brother."
2 And Jacob said unto his household, and unto all that were with him, "Put away the strange gods that are among you;"
