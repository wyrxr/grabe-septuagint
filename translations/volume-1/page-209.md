194 ΛΕΥΙΤΙΚΟΝ ΚΕΦ. ΙΓ´.
τοῦ, καὶ καθαριεῖ αὐτὸν ὁ ἱερεὺς τὴν ἀφήν· ἔτι πᾶν μετέβαλε
14 λευκόν, καθαρόν ἐστι. Καὶ ἣ ἂν ἡμέρα ὀφθῇ ἐν αὐτῷ χρῶς ζῶν,
15 μιανθήσεται· καὶ ὄψεται ὁ ἱερεὺς τὸν χρῶτα τὸν ὑγιῆ, καὶ μιανεῖ
16 αὐτόν· ὁ χρῶς ὁ ὑγής, (ὅτι) ἀκάθαρτός ἐστι, λέπρα ἐστίν. Ἐὰν
δὲ ἀποκαταστῇ ὁ χρῶς ὑγιής, καὶ μεταβάλῃ λευκή, καὶ ἐλεύ-
17 σεται πρὸς τὸν ἱερέα· καὶ ὄψεται αὐτὸν ὁ ἱερεύς, καὶ ἰδοὺ μετέ-
βαλεν ἡ ἀφὴ εἰς τὸ λευκόν, καὶ καθαριεῖ ὁ ἱερεὺς τὴν ἀφὴν (καὶ)
18 καθαρός ἐστι. Καὶ σὰρξ ἐὰν γένηται ἐν τῷ δέρματι αὐτοῦ ἕλ-
19 κος, καὶ ὑγιασθῇ, καὶ γένηται ἐν τῷ τόπῳ τοῦ ἕλκους οὐλὴ λευ-
κή, ἢ τηλαυγὴς λευκαίνουσα, ἢ πυρρίζουσα, καὶ ὀφθήσεται τῷ
20 ἱερεῖ, καὶ ὄψεται ὁ ἱερεύς, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἡ ὄψις ταπεινοτέρα τοῦ δέρ-
ματος, καὶ ἡ θρὶξ αὐτῆς μετέβαλεν εἰς λευκήν, καὶ μιανεῖ αὐτὸν
21 ὁ ἱερεύς· λέπρα ἐστίν, ἐν τῷ ἕλκει ἐξηνθησεν. Ἐὰν δὲ ἴδῃ ὁ ἱε-
ρεύς, καὶ ἰδοὺ οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν αὐτῷ θρὶξ λευκή, καὶ ταπεινὸν μὴ ἦ
ἀπὸ τοῦ δέρματος τοῦ χρωτός, καὶ αὕτη ἡ ἀμαυρά, καὶ ἀφοριεῖ
22 αὐτὸν ὁ ἱερεὺς ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας. Ἐὰν δὲ διαχύσει διαχένηται ἐν τῷ
δέρματι, καὶ μιανεῖ αὐτὸν ὁ ἱερεύς· ἀφὴ λέπρας ἐστίν, ἐν τῷ ἕλ-
23 κει ἐξηνθησεν. Ἐὰν δὲ κατὰ χώραν αὐτοῦ μείνῃ τὸ τηλαύγημα,
καὶ μὴ διαχέηται, οὐλὴ τοῦ ἕλκους ἐστι, καὶ καθαριεῖ αὐτὸν ὁ
24 ἱερεύς. Καὶ σὰρξ ἐὰν γένηται ἐν τῷ δέρματι αὐτοῦ κατάκαυμα
πυρός, καὶ γένηται ἐν τῷ δέρματι αὐτοῦ ὑγιασθὲν τοῦ κατακαύ-
ματος **αὐγάζον** τηλαυγὲς λευκόν, ὑποπυρρίζον, ἢ ἔκλευκον, καὶ
ὄψεται αὐτὸ ὁ ἱερεύς, καὶ ἰδοὺ μετέβαλε θρὶξ λευκὴ εἰς τὸ **αὐ-**
γάζον, καὶ ἡ ὄψις αὐτοῦ ταπεινὴ ἀπὸ τοῦ δέρματος, λέπρα ἐστίν,
ἐν τῷ κατακαύματι ἐξηνθησε, καὶ μιανεῖ αὐτὸν ὁ ἱερεύς· ἀφὴ λέ-
26 πρας ἐστίν. Ἐὰν δὲ ἴδῃ ὁ ἱερεύς, καὶ ἰδοὺ οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν τῷ **αὐ-**
γάζοντι θρὶξ λευκή, καὶ ταπεινὸν μὴ ἦ ἀπὸ τοῦ δέρματος, αὐτὸ
27 δὲ ἀμαυρόν, καὶ ἀφοριεῖ αὐτὸν ὁ ἱερεὺς ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας· καὶ ὄψεται
αὐτὸν ὁ ἱερεὺς τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ· ἐὰν δὲ διαχύσει διαχέηται
ἐν τῷ δέρματι, καὶ μιανεῖ αὐτὸν ὁ ἱερεύς· ἀφὴ λέπρας ἐστίν,
28 ἐν τῷ ἕλκει ἐξηνθησεν. Ἐὰν δὲ κατὰ χώραν μείνῃ τὸ **αὐγάζον**,
καὶ μὴ διαχυθῇ ἐν τῷ δέρματι, αὕτη δὲ ἡ ἀμαυρά, ἡ οὐλὴ τοῦ
κατακαύματός ἐστι, καὶ καθαριεῖ αὐτὸν ὁ ἱερεύς· ὁ γὰρ χαρακτὴρ
29 τοῦ κατακαύματός ἐστι. Καὶ ἀνδρὶ καὶ γυναικὶ ἐὰν γένηται ἐν
30 αὐτοῖς ἀφὴ λέπρας ἐν τῇ κεφαλῇ ἢ ἐν τῷ πώγωνι, καὶ ὄψεται ὁ
ἱερεὺς τὴν ἀφήν, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἡ ὄψις αὐτῆς ἐγκαιλοτέρα τοῦ δέρματος,

## English Translation:

### Leviticus 13

**13** [of it], and the priest shall cleanse him of the affliction; yet if all hath turned white, it is clean.
**14** But in whatsoever day a live raw spot [of skin] shall appear in him, he shall be unclean.
**15** And the priest shall behold the raw flesh, and shall pronounce him unclean:
**16** The raw flesh, (because) it is unclean, it is leprosy.
**17** But if the raw flesh return again to whole [skin], and be changed to white, then he shall come unto the priest: And the priest shall look upon him, and, behold, the affliction is turned into white; and the priest shall cleanse the affliction, [and] he shall be clean.

**18** And if a boil shall arise in the skin of his flesh, and it be healed,
**19** And in the place of the boil there is a white scar, or a glistening white [spot] that maketh white, or reddish, and it shall be shown unto the priest;
**20** Then the priest shall look upon *it*, and, behold, if the appearance thereof be deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean:
**21** It is leprosy; it hath broken out of the boil. But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there is no white hair therein, and if it be not deeper than the skin of the flesh, but this [spot] be faint, then the priest shall shut him up seven days.
**22** And if by spreading it spreadeth in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is an affliction of leprosy, it hath broken out of the boil.
**23** But if the glistening spot abide in its own place, and spread not, it is a scar of the boil; and the priest shall cleanse him.

**24** And if a burn of fire shall arise in the skin of his flesh, and if in the skin thereof, after the burn is healed, there be a glistening, bright white [spot], somewhat reddish, or exceeding white, then the priest shall look upon it;
**25** And, behold, if white hair hath turned in the glistening spot, and the appearance thereof be deeper than the skin, it is leprosy; it hath broken out of the burn: and the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is an affliction of leprosy.
**26** But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hair in the glistening spot, and it be not deeper than the skin, but this [spot] be faint, then the priest shall shut him up seven days:
**27** And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: and if by spreading it spreadeth in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is an affliction of leprosy, it hath broken out of the boil.
**28** But if the glistening spot abide in its place, and spread not in the skin, but this [spot] be faint, it is the scar of the burn; and the priest shall cleanse him: for it is the mark of the burn.

**29** And if a man or a woman shall have an affliction of leprosy upon the head or upon the beard,
**30** Then the priest shall look upon the affliction, and, behold, if the appearance thereof be more deeply hollowed than the skin,
