    ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ
    ΚΕΦ. ΜΘ΄. XLIX.

    1 ἘΚΑΛΕΣΕ δὲ Ἰακὼβ τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπε· συνάχθητε,
    ἵνα ἀναγγείλω ὑμῖν, τί ἀπαντήσει ὑμῖν ἐπ᾿ ἐσχάτων τῶν ἡμερῶν·
    2 ἀθροίσθητε, καὶ ἀκούσατε υἱοὶ Ἰακώβ· ἀκούσατε Ἰσραὴλ τοῦ πατρὸς
    3 ὑμῶν. Ῥουβὴν πρωτότοκός μου, σὺ ἰσχύς μου, καὶ ἀρχὴ
    4 τέκνων μου· σκληρὸς φέρεσθαι, καὶ σκληρὸς αὐθάδης. Ἐξύβρισας
    5 ὡς ὕδωρ, μὴ ἐκζέσῃς· ἀνέβης γὰρ ἐπὶ τὴν κοίτην τοῦ πατρός σου,
    6 τότε ἐμίανας τὴν στρωμνήν, οὗ ἀνέβης. Συμεὼν καὶ Λευὶ ἀδελφοὶ
    συνετελέσαν ἀδικίαν ἐξ αἱρέσεως αὐτῶν·
    7 εἰς βουλὴν αὐτῶν μὴ ἔλθοι ἡ ψυχή μου, καὶ ἐπὶ τῇ συστάσει αὐτῶν μὴ ἐρίσαι τὰ ἥπατά μου·
    ὅτι ἐν τῷ θυμῷ αὐτῶν ἀπέκτειναν ἀνθρώπους, καὶ ἐν τῇ ἐπιθυμίᾳ αὐτῶν ἐνευροκόπησαν ταῦρον.
    8 Ἐπικατάρατος ὁ θυμὸς αὐτῶν ὅτι αὐθάδης, καὶ ἡ μῆνις αὐτῶν ὅτι ἐσκληρύνθη· διαμεριῶ αὐτοὺς
    ἐν Ἰακώβ, καὶ διασκορπιῶ αὐτοὺς ἐν Ἰσραήλ.
    9 Ἰούδα, σὲ αἰνέσαισαν οἱ ἀδελφοί σου· αἱ χεῖρές σου ἐπὶ νώτου τῶν ἐχθρῶν σου·
    προσκυνήσουσι σε υἱοὶ τοῦ πατρός σου.
    10 Σκύμνος λέοντος Ἰούδα· ἐκ βλαστοῦ υἱέ μου ἀνέβης· ἀναπεσὼν ἐκοιμήθη ὡς λέων καὶ ὡς
    σκύμνος, τίς ἐγερεῖ αὐτόν; Οὐκ ἐκλείψει ἄρχων ἐξ Ἰούδα, καὶ
    ἡγούμενος ἐκ τῶν μηρῶν αὐτοῦ, ἕως ἂν ἔλθῃ ᾧ ἀπόκειται· καὶ
    αὐτὸς προσδοκία ἐθνῶν.
    11 Δεσμεύων πρὸς ἄμπελον τὸν πῶλον αὐτοῦ, καὶ τῇ ἕλικι τὸν πῶλον τῆς ὄνου αὐτοῦ· πλυνεῖ ἐν οἴνῳ τὴν
    στολὴν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐν αἵματι σταφυλῆς τὴν περιβολὴν αὐτοῦ.
    12 Χαροποιοὶ οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ οἴνου, καὶ λευκοὶ οἱ ὀδόντες αὐτοῦ ἢ γάλα.
    13 Ζαβουλὼν παράλιος κατοικήσει, καὶ αὐτὸς παρ᾿ ὅρμον πλοίων, καὶ παρατενεῖ ἕως Σιδῶνος.
    14 Ἰσσάχαρ τὸ καλὸν ἐπεθύμησεν, ἀναπαυόμενος ἐν μέσῳ τῶν κλήρων·
    15 καὶ ἰδὼν τὴν ἀνάπαυσιν ὅτι καλή, καὶ τὴν γῆν ὅτι πίων, ὑπέθηκε τὸν ὦμον αὐτοῦ εἰς
    τὸ πονεῖν, καὶ ἐγενήθη ἀνὴρ γεωργός.
    16 Δὰν κρινεῖ τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ, ὡσεὶ καὶ μία φυλὴ ἐν Ἰσραήλ.
    17 Καὶ γενηθήτω Δὰν ὄφις ἐφ᾿ ὁδοῦ, ἐγκαθήμενος ἐπὶ τρίβου, δάκνων πτέρναν ἵππου·
    18 καὶ πεσεῖται ὁ ἵππεὺς εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω, τὴν σωτηρίαν περιμένων Κυρίου.
    19 Γάδ, πειρατήριον πειρατεύσει αὐτόν, αὐτὸς δὲ πειρατεύσει αὐτὸν κατὰ πόδας.
    20 Ἀσήρ, πίων αὐτοῦ ὁ ἄρτος, καὶ αὐτὸς διαδώσει τρυφὴν ἄρχουσι.
    21 Νεφθαλείμ στέλεγος ἀνειμένον, ἐπιδιδοὺς ἐν τῷ γενήματι

    GENESIS
    CHAPTER 49

    ¹ Then Jacob called his sons, and said:
    "Gather yourselves together,
    that I may tell you what shall befall you in the last days.
    ² Assemble yourselves, and hearken, ye sons of Jacob;
    hearken, O Israel, unto your father.

    ³ Reuben, my firstborn art thou,
    my might and the beginning of my children;
    ⁴ Hard to bear, and hard in self-will.
    Thou didst run riot as water, boil not forth;
    ⁵ For thou wentest up unto thy father's bed,
    ⁶ Then didst thou defile the couch whereon thou didst ascend.

    Simeon and Levi, brethren,
    did accomplish unrighteousness from out of their own choice;
    ⁷ Into their counsel let not my soul come,
    and in their assembly let not my vitals strive;
    For in their wrath did they slay men,
    and in their desire did they hamstring a bull.
    ⁸ Cursed be their wrath, for it was self-willed,
    and their fierce anger, for it was hardened.
    I shall divide them in Jacob,
    and scatter them in Israel.

    ⁹ Judah, thee shall thy brethren praise;
    thy hands shall be upon the back of thine enemies;
    the sons of thy father shall bow down before thee.
    ¹⁰ Judah is a lion's whelp:
    from a shoot, my son, thou didst ascend.
    Lying down, he slumbered as a lion,
    and as a lion's cub; who shall rouse him?
    A ruler shall not fail from Judah,
    nor a leader from his loins,
    until he shall come for whom it is reserved;
    and he himself shall be the expectation of nations.
    ¹¹ He shall bind his foal unto a vine,
    and his ass's foal unto the tendril [of the vine];
    he shall wash his garment in wine,
    and his cloak in the blood of the grape.
    ¹² His eyes shall be bright from wine,
    and his teeth whiter than milk.

    ¹³ Zebulun shall dwell by the seashore,
    and he himself shall be by the haven of ships;
    and he shall stretch forth unto Sidon.

    ¹⁴ Issachar hath coveted that which is good,
    reposing amidst the portions [of land];
    ¹⁵ And seeing his resting place that it was good,
    and the land that it was fat,
    he bowed his shoulder unto labor,
    and became a husbandman.

    ¹⁶ Dan shall judge his people,
    even as one tribe in Israel.
    ¹⁷ And let Dan be a serpent by the way,
    sitting upon the path, biting the heel of a horse;
    ¹⁸ And the horseman shall fall backward,
    awaiting the salvation of the Lord.

    ¹⁹ Gad, a raiding band shall raid him,
    but he himself shall raid them at their heels.

    ²⁰ Asher, fat shall be his bread,
    and he himself shall distribute dainties unto rulers.

    ²¹ Naphtali is a spreading stem,
    yielding in its produce.
