ΔΕΥΤΕΡΟΝΟΜΙΟΝ
ΚΕΦ. ΙΒ΄. XII

¹ ΚΑΙ ταῦτα τὰ προστάγματα καὶ τὰ κρίματα, ἃ φυλάξεσθε
τοῦ ποιῆσαι ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, ἧς Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τῶν πατέρων ὑμῶν δίδωσιν
ὑμῖν ἐν κλήρῳ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας, ἃς ὑμεῖς ζῆτε ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς
² ἀπωλείᾳ ἀπολεῖτε πάντα τὰ ἔθνη, ἐν οἷς ἐλάτρευσαν ἐκεῖ τοῖς
θεοῖς αὐτῶν, οὓς ὑμεῖς κατακληρονομεῖτε αὐτούς, ἐπὶ τῶν ὀρέων
τῶν ὑψηλῶν, καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν θινῶν, καὶ ὑποκάτω παντὸς δένδρου
³ δασέος· καὶ κατασκάψετε τοὺς βωμοὺς αὐτῶν, καὶ συντρίψετε τὰς
στήλας αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰ ἄλση αὐτῶν ἐκκόψετε, καὶ τὰ γλυπτὰ τῶν
θεῶν αὐτῶν κατακαύσετε πυρί, καὶ ἀπολεῖτε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτῶν ἐκ
⁴ τοῦ τόπου ἐκείνου. Οὐ ποιήσετε οὕτως Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ ὑμῶν·
⁵ ἀλλ᾿ ἢ εἰς τὸν τόπον, ὃν ἂν ἐκλέξηται Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν ἐν
μιᾷ τῶν φυλῶν ὑμῶν, ἐπονομάσαι τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ ἐκεῖ καὶ ἐπικληθῆναι,
καὶ ἐκζητήσετε καὶ εἰσελεύσεσθε ἐκεῖ.
⁶ Καὶ οἴσετε ἐκεῖ τὰ ὁλοκαυτώματα ὑμῶν, καὶ τὰ θυσιάσματα ὑμῶν, καὶ τὰς
δεκάτας ὑμῶν, καὶ τὰς ἀπαρχὰς τῶν χειρῶν ὑμῶν, καὶ τὰς εὐχάς
ὑμῶν, καὶ τὰ ἑκούσια ὑμῶν, καὶ τὰ πρωτότοκα τῶν βοῶν
⁷ ὑμῶν καὶ τῶν προβάτων ὑμῶν· καὶ φάγεσθε ἐκεῖ ἐναντίον Κυρίου
τοῦ Θεοῦ ὑμῶν, καὶ εὐφρανθήσεσθε ἐπὶ πᾶσιν, οὗ ἐὰν ἐπιβάλητε
τὰς χεῖρας ὑμῶν, ὑμεῖς καὶ οἱ οἶκοι ὑμῶν, καθότι εὐλόγησέ
⁸ σε Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου. Οὐ ποιήσετε κατὰ πάντα ἃ ἡμεῖς ποιοῦμεν
ὧδε σήμερον, ἕκαστος τὸ ἀρεστὸν ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ·
⁹ οὐ γὰρ ἤκατε ἕως τοῦ νῦν εἰς τὴν κατάπαυσιν καὶ εἰς τὴν κληρονομίαν, ἣν
¹⁰ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν δίδωσιν ὑμῖν· καὶ διαβήσεσθε τὸν Ἰορδάνην,
καὶ κατοικήσετε ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, ἧς Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν κατακληρονομήσει
ὑμῖν, καὶ καταπαύσει ὑμᾶς ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν ἐχθρῶν
¹¹ ὑμῶν τῶν κύκλῳ, καὶ κατοικήσετε μετὰ ἀσφαλείας. Καὶ ἔσται
ὁ τόπος ὃν ἂν ἐκλέξηται Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν ἐν αὐτῷ, ἐπικληθῆναι
τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ ἐκεῖ, ἐκεῖ οἴσετε πάντα ὅσα ἐγὼ ἐντέλλομαι
ὑμῖν σήμερον, τὰ ὁλοκαυτώματα ὑμῶν, καὶ τὰ θυσιάσματα
ὑμῶν, καὶ τὰ ἐπιδέκατα ὑμῶν, καὶ τὰς ἀπαρχὰς τῶν χειρῶν
ὑμῶν, καὶ τὰ δόματα ὑμῶν, καὶ πᾶν ἐκλεκτὸν τῶν δώρων ὑμῶν,
¹² ὅσα ἂν εὔξησθε Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ ὑμῶν· καὶ εὐφρανθήσεσθε ἔναντι
Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ὑμῶν, ὑμεῖς καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ ὑμῶν καὶ αἱ θυγατέρες

**DEUTERONOMY**
**CHAPTER XII**

**¹** These are the statutes and the judgments, which ye shall keep to perform in the land, which the Lord, the God of your fathers, doth give unto you for an inheritance, all the days that ye shall live upon the earth.
**²** Ye shall utterly make to perish all the nations, wherein they served their gods, whom ye shall dispossess and inherit, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and beneath every dense tree.
**³** And ye shall demolish their altars, and ye shall break down their pillars, and their groves ye shall cut down, and the graven images of their gods ye shall consume with fire, and ye shall destroy their name out of that place.
**⁴** Ye shall not do so unto the Lord your God.
**⁵** But unto the place which the Lord your God shall choose in one of your tribes, to call His Name there and that it may be invoked, there shall ye seek [Him] and thither shall ye go.
**⁶** And thither shall ye bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the firstfruits of your hands, and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your oxen and of your sheep.
**⁷** And ye shall eat there before the Lord your God, and ye shall rejoice in all things, to which ye shall put forth your hands, ye and your households, for the Lord your God hath blessed thee.
**⁸** Ye shall not do according to all things which we do here this day, every man that which is pleasing in his own eyes.
**⁹** For ye have not come as yet unto the rest and unto the inheritance, which the Lord your God giveth unto you.
**¹⁰** And ye shall cross over the Jordan, and ye shall dwell in the land, which the Lord your God shall give unto you for an inheritance, and He shall give you rest from all your enemies round about, and ye shall dwell in security.
**¹¹** And it shall be that the place which the Lord your God shall choose therein, that His Name may be invoked there, thither shall ye bring all things whatsoever I command you this day: your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the firstfruits of your hands, and your gifts, and every chosen thing of your gifts, whatsoever ye shall vow unto the Lord your God.
**¹²** And ye shall rejoice before the Lord your God, ye, and your sons, and your daughters,
