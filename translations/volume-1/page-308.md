ΚΕΦ. ΛΑʹ. ΛΑʹ. ΑΡΙΘΜΟΙ 293
χὰς αὐτῆς, καὶ κατὰ τοὺς ὁρισμοὺς τοὺς κατὰ τῆς ψυχῆς αὐτῆς,
οὐ μενεῖ αὐτῇ· ὁ ἀνὴρ αὐτῆς περιεῖλεν αὐτά, καὶ Κύριος καθα-
ριεῖ αὐτήν. Πᾶσα εὐχὴ καὶ πᾶς ὅρκος δεσμοῦ κακῶσαι ψυχήν, ὃ 14
ἀνὴρ αὐτῆς στήσει αὐτῇ, καὶ ὁ ἀνὴρ αὐτῆς περιελεῖ αὐτήν. Ἐὰν 15
δὲ σιωπῶν παρασιωπήσῃ αὐτῇ ὁ ἀνὴρ αὐτῆς ἡμέραν ἐξ ἡμέρας,
καὶ στήσει αὐτῇ πάσας τὰς εὐχὰς αὐτῆς, καὶ πάντας τοὺς ὁρι-
σμοὺς αὐτῆς τοὺς ἐπ᾿ αὐτῇ, στήσει αὐτή, ὅτι ἐσιώπησεν αὐτῇ τῇ
ἡμέρᾳ ᾗ ἤκουσεν. Ἐὰν δὲ περιαιρῶν περιέλῃ αὐτῆς μετὰ τὴν ἡ- 16
μέραν ἣν ἤκουσε, καὶ λήψεται τὴν ἁμαρτίαν αὐτοῦ. Ταῦτα τὰ 17
δικαιώματα, ὅσα ἐνετείλατο Κύριος τῷ Μωσῇ, ἀναμέσον ἀνδρὸς
καὶ ἀναμέσον γυναικὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀναμέσον πατρὸς καὶ θυγατρὸς
αὐτοῦ ἐν νεότητι αὐτῆς, ἐν οἴκῳ πατρὸς αὐτῆς.

ΚΕΦ. ΛΑʹ. XXXI.

ΚΑΙ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωσῆν, λέγων· ἐκδίκει 2
τὴν ἐκδίκησιν τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ ἐκ τῶν Μαδιανιτῶν, καὶ ἔσχα-
τον προστεθήσῃ πρὸς τὸν λαόν σου. Καὶ ἐλάλησε Μωσῆς πρὸς 3
τὸν λαόν, λέγων· ἐξοπλίσατε ἐξ ὑμῶν ἄνδρας, (καὶ) παρατάξασθαι
ἔναντι Κυρίου ἐπὶ Μαδιάν, ἀποδοῦναι ἐκδίκησιν παρὰ τοῦ Κυρίου
τῇ Μαδιάν· χιλίους ἐκ φυλῆς καὶ χιλίους ἐκ φυλῆς, ἐκ πασῶν 4
φυλῶν Ἰσραήλ, ἀποστείλατε παρατάξασθαι. Καὶ ἐξηρίθμησαν ἐκ 5
τῶν χιλιάδων Ἰσραὴλ χιλίους ἐκ φυλῆς, δώδεκα χιλιάδας, ἐνω-
πλισμένοι εἰς παράταξιν. Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν αὐτοὺς Μωσῆς χιλίους 6
ἐκ φυλῆς, καὶ χιλίους ἐκ φυλῆς σὺν δυνάμει αὐτῶν, καὶ Φινεὲς
υἱὸν Ἐλεάζαρ υἱοῦ Ἀαρὼν τοῦ ἱερέως εἰς παράταξιν· καὶ τὰ σκεύη
τὰ ἅγια, καὶ αἱ σάλπιγγες τῶν σημασιῶν ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτῶν.
Καὶ παρετάξαντο ἐπὶ Μαδιάν, καθὰ ἐνετείλατο Κύριος τῷ Μω- 7
υσῇ, καὶ ἀπέκτειναν πᾶν ἀρσενικόν· καὶ τοὺς βασιλεῖς Μαδιὰν 8
ἀπέκτειναν ἅμα τοῖς τραυματίαις αὐτῶν, καὶ τὸν Εὐείν, καὶ τὸν
Ῥοκόμ, καὶ τὸν Σούρ, καὶ τὸν Οὔρ, καὶ τὸν Ῥοβόκ, πέντε βα-
σιλεῖς Μαδιάν· καὶ τὸν Βαλαὰμ υἱὸν Βαϊὼρ ἀπέκτειναν ἐν ῥομ-
φαίᾳ σὺν τοῖς τραυματίαις αὐτῶν. Καὶ προενόμευσαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσ- 9
ραὴλ τὰς γυναῖκας Μαδιάν, καὶ τὴν ἀποσκευὴν αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰ κτή-
νη αὐτῶν, καὶ πάντα τὰ ἐγκτήματα αὐτῶν, καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν δύνα-
μιν αὐτῶν ἐπρονόμευσαν· καὶ πάσας τὰς πόλεις αὐτῶν τὰς ἐν ταῖς 10

**Chapter XXX.**

¹³…her [vows], and according to the restrictions upon her soul, it shall not stand for her; for her husband hath annulled them, and the Lord shall cleanse her.
¹⁴Every vow and every binding oath to afflict a soul, which her husband shall confirm unto her, and which her husband shall annul, [it shall be so].
¹⁵But if her husband shall wholly hold his peace concerning her day by day, then shall he confirm unto her all her vows, and all her restrictions that are upon her; he shall confirm them, because he held his peace concerning her on the day that he heard [them].
¹⁶But if he shall wholly annul her [vow] after the day that he heard [it], then shall he bear his iniquity.
¹⁷These are the statutes which the Lord commanded Moses, between a man and between his wife, and between a father and his daughter in her youth, while she yet liveth in her father's house.

⁵And they numbered out of the thousands of Israel a thousand from each tribe, twelve thousand, being armed for battle.
⁶And Moses sent them, a thousand from each tribe, yea, a thousand from each tribe, with their company; and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, for battle; and the holy vessels, and the trumpets of alarms, were in their hands.

⁸And the kings of Midian they slew with their slain, namely, Eui, and Rocom, and Sour, and Our, and Roboc, five kings of Midian; and Balaam the son of Baior they slew with the sword, among their slain.
