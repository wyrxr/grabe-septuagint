           αὐτῶν, ἑξακόσιαι χιλιάδες καὶ τρισχίλιοι καὶ πεντακόσιοι καὶ πεν-
33 τήκοντα. Οἱ δὲ Λευῖται οὐ συνεπισκέπησαν αὐτοῖς, καθὰ ἐνετεί-
34 λατο Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ. Καὶ ἐποίησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ καθὰ ἐνε-
           τείλατο Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ· οὕτω παρενέβαλον κατὰ τάγμα αὐτῶν,
           καὶ οὕτως ἐξῆρον ἕκαστος ἐχόμενοι κατὰ δήμους αὐτῶν, κατ᾿ οἴ-
           κους πατριῶν αὐτῶν.

1          ΚΑΙ αὗται αἱ γενέσεις Ἀαρὼν καὶ Μωυσῆ, ἐν ᾗ ἡμέρᾳ ἐ-
2          λάλησε Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ ἐν τῷ ὄρει Σινᾶ· καὶ ταῦτα τὰ ὀνό-
           ματα τῶν υἱῶν Ἀαρὼν πρωτότοκος Ναδάβ, καὶ Ἀβιοὺδ, καὶ Ἑ-
3          λεάζαρ, καὶ Ἰθάμαρ. Ταῦτα τὰ ὀνόματα τῶν υἱῶν Ἀαρὼν, οἱ
           ἱερεῖς (καὶ) οἱ ἠλειμμένοι, οὓς ἐτελείωσε τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν τοῦ
4          ἱερατεύειν. Καὶ ἐτελεύτησε Ναδὰβ καὶ Ἀβιοὺδ ἔναντι Κυρίου, προσ-
           φερόντων αὐτῶν πῦρ ἀλλότριον ἔναντι Κυρίου ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ Σινᾷ,
           καὶ παιδία οὐκ ἦν αὐτοῖς· καὶ ἱεράτευσεν Ἐλεάζαρ καὶ Ἰθάμαρ
5          μετὰ Ἀαρὼν τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυ-
6          σῆν, λέγων· λάβε τὴν φυλὴν τὴν Λευὶ, καὶ στήσεις αὐτοὺς ἔναν-
7          τιον Ἀαρὼν τοῦ ἱερέως, καὶ λειτουργήσουσιν αὐτῷ· καὶ φυλάξουσι
           τὰς φυλακὰς αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰς φυλακὰς πάντων τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ
           ἔναντι τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου, ἐργάζεσθαι τὰ ἔργα τῆς σκηνῆς·
8          καὶ φυλάξουσι πάντα τὰ σκεύη τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου, καὶ τὰς
9          φυλακὰς τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ κατὰ πάντα τὰ ἔργα τῆς σκηνῆς καὶ
           δώσεις τοὺς Λευίτας Ἀαρὼν (τῷ ἀδελφῷ σου,) καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐ-
           τοῦ τοῖς ἱερεῦσι· δόμα δεδομένοι οὗτοί μοι εἰσὶν ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰ-
10         σραήλ. Καὶ Ἀαρὼν καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ καταστήσεις ἐπὶ τῆς
           σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου, καὶ φυλάξουσι τὴν ἱερατείαν αὐτῶν, καὶ
           πάντα τὰ κατὰ τὸν βωμὸν, καὶ τὰ ἔσω τοῦ καταπετάσματος·
11         καὶ ὁ ἀλλογενὴς ὁ ἁπτόμενος ἀποθανεῖται. Καὶ ἐλάλησε Κύριος
12         πρὸς Μωυσῆν, λέγων· καὶ ἐγὼ ἰδοὺ εἴληφα τοὺς Λευίτας ἐκ μέ-
           σου τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ ἀντὶ παντὸς πρωτοτόκου διανοίγοντος μή-
           τραν παρὰ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ, λύτρα αὐτῶν ἔσονται, καὶ ἔσονται
13         ἐμοὶ οἱ Λευῖται· ἐμοὶ γὰρ πᾶν πρωτότοκον, ἐν ᾗ ἡμέρᾳ ἐπάταξα
           πᾶν πρωτότοκον ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτου, ἡγίασα ἐμοὶ πᾶν πρωτότοκον ἐν
           Ἰσραὴλ, ἀπὸ ἀνθρώπου ἕως κτήνους· ἐμοί ἔσονται· ἐγὼ Κύριος.

**NUMBERS**
**Chapter 2**

33 of them were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty. But the Levites were not numbered with them, according as the LORD had commanded Moses.
34 And the children of Israel did according as the LORD had commanded Moses: so they pitched [their tents] by their ranks, and so they journeyed, each [man] holding fast to his clans, according to the houses of their fathers.

**Chapter 3**

1 AND these are the generations of Aaron and Moses, in the day when the LORD spake unto Moses in Mount Sinai.
2 And these are the names of the sons of Aaron: Nadab the firstborn, and Abihu, and Eleazar, and Ithamar.
3 These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests (and) the anointed ones, whom He perfected in their hands for the priesthood.
4 And Nadab and Abihu died before the LORD, when they offered strange fire before the LORD in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had no children; and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered as priests with Aaron their father.
5 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying:
6 Take the tribe of Levi, and set them before Aaron the priest, and they shall minister unto him.
7 And they shall keep his charges, and the charges of all the children of Israel before the tabernacle of testimony, to perform the service of the tabernacle.
8 And they shall keep all the vessels of the tabernacle of testimony, and the charges concerning the children of Israel, according to all the service of the tabernacle; and thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron (thy brother), and unto his sons the priests;
9 for these are given as a gift unto Me from the children of Israel.
10 And Aaron and his sons shalt thou appoint over the tabernacle of testimony, and they shall keep their priesthood, and all that pertaineth to the altar, and that which is within the veil.
11 And the stranger who draws near shall surely die.
12 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying: Behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel, in the stead of every firstborn that opens the womb among the children of Israel; and the Levites shall be a ransom for them, and they shall be Mine.
13 For every firstborn is Mine; for on the day when I smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I sanctified unto Myself all the firstborn in Israel, both of man and of beast; they shall be Mine: I am the LORD.
