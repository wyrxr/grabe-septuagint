τῆς εὐχῆς τοῦ ἁγνισμοῦ αὐτοῦ ξυρὸν οὐκ ἐπελεύσεται ἐπὶ τὴν
κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ, ἕως ἂν πληρωθῶσιν αἱ ἡμέραι, ἃς ηὔξατο Κυρίῳ·
ἅγιος ἔσται, τρέφων κόμην τρίχα κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ. Πάσας τὰς ἡ- 6
μέρας τῆς εὐχῆς αὐτοῦ τῷ Κυρίῳ ἐπὶ πάσῃ ψυχῇ τετελευτηκυίᾳ
οὐκ εἰσελεύσεται· ἐπὶ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπὶ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπ᾿ 7
ἀδελφῷ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπ᾿ ἀδελφῇ αὐτοῦ, οὐ μιανθήσεται ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῖς
ἀποθανόντων αὐτῶν, ὅτι εὐχὴ Θεοῦ αὐτοῦ ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ ἐπὶ κεφαλῆς
αὐτοῦ· πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς εὐχῆς αὐτοῦ ἅγιος ἔσται Κυρίῳ. 8
Ἐὰν δέ τις θανάτῳ ἀποθάνῃ ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ ἐξάπινα, παραχρῆμα μιαν- 9
θήσεται ἡ κεφαλὴ εὐχῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ξυρήσεται τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ,
ᾗ ἂν ἡμέρᾳ καθαρισθῇ· τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ ξυρηθήσεται αὐτήν·
τῇ δὲ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ὀγδόῃ οἴσει δύο τρυγόνας ἢ δύο νεοσσοὺς περι- 10
στερῶν πρὸς τὸν ἱερέα, ἐπὶ τὰς θύρας τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου.
Καὶ ποιήσει ὁ ἱερεὺς μίαν περὶ ἁμαρτίας, καὶ μίαν εἰς ὁλοκαύ- 11
τωμα, καὶ ἐξιλάσεται περὶ αὐτοῦ ὁ ἱερεὺς περὶ ὧν ἥμαρτε περὶ
τῆς ψυχῆς, καὶ ἁγιάσει τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ,
ᾗ ἡγίασε Κυρίῳ (πάσας) τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς εὐχῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ προ- 12
σάξει ἀμνὸν ἐνιαύσιον εἰς πλημμέλειαν· καὶ αἱ ἡμέραι αἱ πρότε-
ρον ἄλογοι ἔσονται, ὅτι ἐμιάνθη κεφαλὴ εὐχῆς αὐτοῦ. Καὶ οὗτος 13
ὁ νόμος τοῦ εὐξαμένου· ᾗ ἂν ἡμέρᾳ πληρώσῃ ἡμέρας εὐχῆς αὐ-
τοῦ, προσάξει αὐτὸν παρὰ τὰς θύρας τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου·
καὶ προσάξει τὸ δῶρον αὐτοῦ Κυρίῳ ἀμνὸν ἐνιαύσιον ἄμωμον ἕνα 14
εἰς ὁλοκαύτωμα, καὶ ἀμνάδα ἐνιαυσίαν ἄμωμον μίαν εἰς ἁμαρ-
τίαν, καὶ κριὸν ἕνα ἄμωμον εἰς σωτήριον, καὶ κανοῦν ἀζύμων 15
σεμιδάλεως, ἄρτους ἀναπεποιημένους ἐν ἐλαίῳ, καὶ λάγανα ἀ-
ζυμα κεχρισμένα ἐν ἐλαίῳ, καὶ θυσίαν αὐτῶν, καὶ σπονδὴν αὐ-
τῶν. Καὶ προσάξει ὁ ἱερεὺς ἔναντι Κυρίου, καὶ ποιήσει τὸ περὶ 16
ἁμαρτίας αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὸ ὁλοκαύτωμα αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὸν κριὸν ποιή- 17
σει θυσίαν σωτηρίου Κυρίῳ ἐπὶ τὸ κανοῦν τῶν ἀζύμων, καὶ ποιή-
σει ὁ ἱερεὺς τὴν θυσίαν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὴν σπονδὴν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ξυ- 18
ρήσεται ὁ ηὐγμένος παρὰ τὰς θύρας τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου
τὴν κεφαλὴν τῆς εὐχῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπιθήσει τὰς τρίχας τῆς κε-
φαλῆς εὐχῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ θήσει ἐπὶ τὸ πῦρ, ὃ ἐστιν ὑπὸ τὴν
θυσίαν τοῦ σωτηρίου. Καὶ λήψεται ὁ ἱερεὺς τὸν βραχίονα ἑφθὸν 19
ἀπὸ τοῦ κριοῦ, καὶ ἄρτον ἄζυμον ἕνα ἀπὸ τοῦ κανοῦ, καὶ λάγα-
νον ἄζυμον ἕν, καὶ ἐπιθήσει ἐπὶ τὰς χεῖρας τοῦ ηὐγμένου.

CHAPTER VI. NUMBERS

5 During all the days of the vow of his consecration, no razor shall pass upon his head; until the days be fulfilled, which he hath vowed unto the Lord, he shall be holy, letting grow the locks of the hair of his head.
6 All the days of his vow unto the Lord shall he not come near any soul that is dead.
7 He shall not defile himself for his father, or for his mother, or for his brother, or for his sister, when they die; for the vow of his God is upon him, upon his head.
8 All the days of his vow shall he be holy unto the Lord.
9 But if any man die suddenly by him, and he defile the head of his vow, then shall he shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it.
10 And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, unto the priest, to the doors of the tabernacle of testimony.
11 And the priest shall make one [offering] for sin, and one for a whole burnt offering, and shall make atonement for him, for that which he sinned concerning the soul.
12 And he shall consecrate his head in that day, wherein he consecrated unto the Lord [all] the days of his vow, and shall bring a lamb of a year old for a trespass offering. And the former days shall be void, because the head of his vow was defiled.
13 And this is the law of the Nazirite: On whatsoever day he shall fulfill the days of his vow, he shall bring himself to the doors of the tabernacle of testimony;
14 And he shall bring his offering unto the Lord, one male lamb of a year old without blemish for a whole burnt offering, and one ewe lamb of a year old without blemish for a sin offering,
15 And one ram without blemish for a peace offering; and a basket of unleavened bread, [even] fine flour, cakes made with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and their grain offering, and their drink offering.
16 And the priest shall bring them before the Lord, and shall make his sin offering, and his whole burnt offering.
17 And the ram shall he make a peace offering unto the Lord, together with the basket of unleavened bread. And the priest shall make his grain offering, and his drink offering.
18 And the Nazirite shall shave the head of his vow at the doors of the tabernacle of testimony; and he shall take the hair of the head of his vow, and place it upon the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offering.
19 And the priest shall take the boiled shoulder from the ram, and one unleavened bread from the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall place them upon the hands of the Nazirite.
