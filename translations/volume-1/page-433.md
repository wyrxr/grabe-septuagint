                                         ἡμῖν τὸ ἁμάρτημα Φογώρ, ὅτι οὐ κεκαθαρίσμεθα ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἕως
                                         τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης; καὶ ἐγενήθη πληγὴ ἐν τῇ συναγωγῇ Κυρίου.
18 Καὶ ὑμεῖς ἀποστραφήσεσθε σήμερον ἀπὸ ὄπισθεν Κυρίου· καὶ ἐὰν
                                         ἐὰν ὑμεῖς ἀποστῆτε σήμερον ἀπὸ Κυρίου, καὶ αὔριον ἐπὶ πάντα
19 Ἰσραὴλ ἔσται ὀργή. Καὶ νῦν εἰ μιαρὰ (ὑμῖν) ἡ γῆ τῆς κατασχέ-
                                         σεως ὑμῶν, διάβητε ὑμῖν εἰς τὴν γῆν τῆς κατασχέσεως Κυρίου,
                                         οὗ κατασκηνεῖ ἐκεῖ ἡ σκηνὴ Κυρίου, καὶ κατακληρονομήσατε ἐν
                                         ὑμῖν, καὶ μὴ ἀπὸ Κυρίου ἀποστάται γενήθητε, καὶ ἀπὸ ἡμῶν μὴ
                                         ἀπόστητε, διὰ τὸ οἰκοδομῆσαι ὑμᾶς βωμὸν ἔξω τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου
20 Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν. Οὐχ ἰδοὺ Ἄχαν ὁ τοῦ Ζαρὰ πλημμε-
                                         λεία ἐπλημμέλησεν ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀναθέματος, καὶ ἐπὶ πᾶσαν τὴν συν-
                                         αγωγὴν Ἰσραὴλ ἐγενήθη ὀργή; καὶ οὗτος εἷς μόνος ἦν, μὴ μό-
21 νος οὗτος ἀπέθανεν ἐν τῇ ἑαυτοῦ ἁμαρτίᾳ. Καὶ ἀπεκρίθησαν οἱ υἱοὶ
                                         Ῥουβὴν καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Γὰδ καὶ τὸ ἥμισυ φυλῆς Μανασσῆ, καὶ ἐλά-

                                         ἐστι, καὶ ὁ Θεὸς Θεὸς Κύριος αὐτὸς οἶδε, καὶ Ἰσραὴλ αὐτὸς
                                         γνώσεται, εἰ ἐν ἀποστάσει ἐπλημμελήσαμεν ἔναντι Κυρίου, μὴ
23 ῥύσαιτο ἡμᾶς ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ταύτῃ· καὶ εἰ ᾠκοδομήσαμεν ἑαυτοῖς
                                         βωμὸν, ὥστε ἀποστῆναι ἀπὸ Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν, ὥστε ἀνα-

24 αὐτοῦ θυσίαν σωτηρίου, Κύριος αὐτὸς ἐζητήσει. Ἀλλ᾿ ἕνεκεν εὐ-

                                         μερὶς Κυρίου· καὶ ἀπαλλοτριώσουσιν οἱ υἱοὶ ὑμῶν τοὺς υἱοὺς ἡ-

**Joshua 22**
<sup>18</sup> And ye shall turn away this day from following the LORD; and if, yea, if ye depart this day from the LORD, then tomorrow wrath shall come upon all Israel.
<sup>19</sup> And now, if your land of possession be found unclean unto you, then pass ye over unto yourselves into the land of the LORD's possession, where the tabernacle of the LORD doth dwell, and take ye an inheritance among yourselves. And be ye not apostates from the LORD, nor depart ye from us, by reason of your building an altar outside the altar of the LORD our God.
<sup>20</sup> Was it not Achan the son of Zarah, who committed a grievous trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath came upon all the congregation of Israel? And he was but one man; did he perish alone for his iniquity?
<sup>21</sup> And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh answered, and spake unto the captains of thousands of Israel, saying:
<sup>22</sup> "The God of gods, the LORD, He is; yea, the God of gods, the LORD, He Himself knoweth, and Israel itself shall know, if in apostasy we have trespassed before the LORD, may He not deliver us in this day.
<sup>23</sup> And if we have built for ourselves an altar, so as to depart from the LORD our God, so as to offer up upon it a sacrifice of burnt offerings, or so as to perform upon it a sacrifice of peace offerings, the LORD Himself shall require it [of us].
<sup>24</sup> But for a matter of caution and for a word's sake have we done this, saying: 'Lest tomorrow your children should say unto our children, saying, "What have ye to do with the LORD God of Israel?"'
<sup>25</sup> For the LORD hath set the Jordan as a boundary between us and you, ye children of Reuben and children of Gad; and ye have no portion in the LORD. And so your children will cause our children to cease worshipping the LORD.
<sup>26</sup> And we said, 'Let us make this thing, that we might build this altar, not for the sake of burnt offerings, nor for the sake of sacrifices;
<sup>27</sup> but that it may be a witness between us and between you, and between our generations after us, that we might perform the worship of the LORD before Him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with the sacrifices of our peace offerings. And your children shall not say unto our children tomorrow:
<sup>28</sup> "Ye have no portion in the LORD."' And we said, 'If it should ever come to pass and they speak unto us, or even unto our generations tomorrow, and they say, "Behold the likeness of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made—"'"
