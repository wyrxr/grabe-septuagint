378 Ι Η Σ Ο Υ Σ Ν Α Υ Η ΚΕΦ. Β΄. Γ.
18 τὸ ἐκδήσεις εἰς τὴν θυρίδα, δι᾿ ἧς κατεβίβασας ἡμᾶς ἐν αὐτῇ·
καὶ τὸν πατέρα σου, καὶ τὴν μητέρα σου, καὶ τοὺς ἀδελφούς σου,
καὶ πάντα τὸν οἶκον τοῦ πατρός σου συνάξεις πρὸς σεαυτὴν εἰς τὴν
19 οἰκίαν σου, καὶ ἔσται πᾶς ὃς ἂν ἐξέλθῃ τὴν θύραν τῆς οἰκίας σου
ἔξω, ἔνοχος ἑαυτῷ ἔσται, ἡμεῖς δὲ ἀθῷοι τῷ ὅρκῳ σου τούτῳ·
καὶ ὅσοι ἐὰν γένωνται μετὰ σοῦ ἐν τῇ οἰκία σου, ἡμεῖς ἔνοχοι
20 ἐσόμεθα, ἐὰν χεὶρ ἅψηται αὐτοῦ. Ἐὰν δέ τις ἡμᾶς ἀδικήσῃ, καὶ
ἀποκαλύψῃς τοὺς λόγους ἡμῶν τούτους, ἐσόμεθα ἀθῷοι τῷ ὅρκῳ
21 σου τούτῳ, ᾧ ὤρκισας ἡμᾶς. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα
ὑμῶν οὕτως ἔσται. Καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν αὐτούς, καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν·
22 καὶ ἔδησε τὸ σημεῖον τὸ κόκκινον ἐν τῇ θυρίδι. Καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν,
καὶ ἦλθον εἰς τὴν ὀρεινήν, καὶ κατέμειναν ἐκεῖ τρεῖς ἡμέρας ἕως
ἐπέστρεψαν οἱ διώκοντες· καὶ ἐξεζήτησαν οἱ καταδιώκοντες πάσας
23 τὰς ὁδούς, καὶ οὐχ εὗρον. Καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν οἱ δύο νεανίσκοι, καὶ
κατέβησαν ἐκ τοῦ ὄρους· καὶ διέβησαν καὶ ἦλθοσαν πρὸς Ἰησοῦν
υἱὸν Ναυῆ, καὶ διηγήσαντο αὐτῷ πάντα τὰ συμβεβηκότα αὐτοῖς.
24 Καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς Ἰησοῦν· ὅτι παρέδωκε Κύριος ἐν χειρὶ ἡμῶν πᾶ-
σαν τὴν γῆν, καὶ κατέπιπτε πᾶς ὁ κατοικῶν τὴν γῆν ἐκείνην
ἀφ᾿ ἡμῶν.

ΚΕΦ. Γ΄. ΙΙΙ.

1 ΚΑΙ ὤρθρισεν Ἰησοῦς τὸ πρωΐ, καὶ ἀπῆρον ἐκ Σαττεὶν καὶ
ἦλθον ἕως τοῦ Ἰορδάνου, αὐτὸς καὶ πάντες οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ
2 κατέλυσαν ἐκεῖ πρὸ τοῦ διαβῆναι. Καὶ ἐγενήθη μετὰ τρεῖς ἡμέρας
3 καὶ διῆλθον οἱ γραμματεῖς διὰ μέσης τῆς παρεμβολῆς, καὶ ἐνε-
τείλαντο τῷ λαῷ λέγοντες· ὅταν ἴδητε τὴν κιβωτὸν τῆς διαθήκης
Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν καὶ τοὺς ἱερεῖς (ἡμῶν) καὶ τοὺς Λευΐτας
αἴροντας αὐτήν, καὶ ὑμεῖς ἀπαρεῖτε ἀπὸ τῶν τόπων ὑμῶν, καὶ
4 πορεύσεσθε ὀπίσω αὐτῆς. Ἀλλὰ μακρὰν ἔστω ἀναμέσον ὑμῶν καὶ
ἐκείνης, ὅσον δισχιλίους πήχεις στήσεσθε· μὴ προσεγγίσητε αὐτῇ,
ἵνα ἐπίστησθε τὴν ὁδόν, ἣν πορεύσεσθε αὐτήν· οὐ γὰρ πεπόρευ-
5 σθε τὴν ὁδὸν ἀπ᾿ ἐχθὲς καὶ τρίτης ἡμέρας. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰησοῦς τῷ
λαῷ· ἁγνίσασθε εἰς τὴν αὔριον, ὅτι αὔριον ποιήσει Κύριος ἐν ὑμῖν
6 θαυμαστά. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰησοῦς τοῖς ἱερεῦσι, λέγων· ἄρατε τὴν κι-
βωτὸν τῆς διαθήκης Κυρίου, καὶ προπορεύεσθε τοῦ λαοῦ. Καὶ

**Joshua 2**
18 [then] shalt thou bind this scarlet cord in the window, through which thou didst let us down therein. And thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all the house of thy father, shalt thou gather unto thyself into thy house;
19 and it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall go forth of the door of thy house outside, he shall be guilty unto himself, and we shall be blameless of this thine oath. And as many as shall be with thee in thy house, we shall be guilty,
20 if any hand touch him. But if thou shalt do us wrong, and betray these our words, then we shall be blameless of this thine oath,
21 wherewith thou hast made us swear." And she said unto them, "According to your words, so be it." And she sent them away, and they departed.
22 And she bound the scarlet sign in the window. And they departed, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned. And the pursuers searched throughout all the ways, and found them not.
23 And the two young men returned, and descended from the mountain; and they passed over, and came unto Joshua the son of Nun, and recounted unto him all that had befallen them.
24 And they said unto Joshua, "Verily the Lord hath delivered into our hand all the land; for every inhabitant of that land did faint from before us."

**Joshua 3**
1 And Joshua rose up early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came unto Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over.
2 And it came to pass after three days, that
3 the scribes went through the midst of the camp, and commanded the people, saying, "When ye behold the ark of the covenant of the Lord our God, and the priests (our) and the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your places, and
4 go after it. Nevertheless, there shall be a long space between you and it; about two thousand cubits shall ye stand afar off; draw not nigh unto it, that ye may understand the way by which ye must go; for ye have not passed this way, neither yesterday nor the day before."
5 And Joshua said unto the people, "Sanctify yourselves, for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you."
6 And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, "Take up the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and pass over before the people." And
