14 ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ ΚΕΦ. Θʹ.
5 φάγεσθε. Καὶ γὰρ τὸ ὑμέτερον αἷμα τῶν ψυχῶν ὑμῶν ἐκζητήσω, ἐκ χειρὸς πάντων τῶν θηρίων ἐκζητήσω αὐτό· καὶ ἐκ χειρὸς ἀνθρώπου, καὶ ἐκ χειρὸς ἀνδρὸς ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ ἐκζητήσω τὴν
6 ψυχὴν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου. Ὁ ἐκχέων αἷμα ἀνθρώπου, ἀντὶ τοῦ αἵματος αἷμα αὐτοῦ ἐκχυθήσεται· ὅτι ἐν εἰκόνι Θεοῦ ἐποίησα τὸν
7 ἄνθρωπον. Ὑμεῖς δὲ αὐξάνεσθε καὶ πληθύνεσθε, καὶ πληρώσατε τὴν γῆν, καὶ πληθύνεσθε ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς.
8 Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ Θεὸς τῷ Νῶε καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, λέγων·
9 Ἐγὼ ἰδοὺ ἀνίστημι τὴν διαθήκην μου ὑμῖν, καὶ τῷ σπέρματι ὑμῶν μεθ᾿ ὑμᾶς,
10 καὶ πάσῃ ψυχῇ ζώσῃ μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν ἀπὸ ὀρνέων καὶ ἀπὸ κτηνῶν, καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς θηρίοις τῆς γῆς ὅσα μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν
11 ἐξελθόντων ἐκ τῆς κιβωτοῦ, καὶ στήσω τὴν διαθήκην μου πρὸς ὑμᾶς· καὶ οὐκ ἀποθανεῖται πᾶσα σὰρξ ἔτι ἀπὸ τοῦ ὕδατος τοῦ κατακλυσμοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ἔτι κατακλυσμὸς ὕδατος, τοῦ καταφθεῖραι πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν.
12 Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς πρὸς Νῶε· τοῦτο τὸ σημεῖον τῆς διαθήκης, ὃ ἐγὼ δίδωμι ἀνὰ μέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ ὑμῶν, καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον πάσης ψυχῆς ζώσης ἥ ἐστι μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν, εἰς γενεὰς αἰωνίους·
13 τὸ τόξον μου τίθημι ἐν τῇ νεφέλῃ, καὶ ἔσται εἰς σημεῖον διαθήκης ἀνὰ μέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ τῆς γῆς.
14 Καὶ ἔσται ἐν τῷ συννεφεῖν με νεφέλας ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, ὀφθήσεται τὸ τόξον μου ἐν τῇ νεφέλῃ·
15 καὶ μνησθήσομαι τῆς διαθήκης μου, ἥ ἐστιν ἀνὰ μέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ ὑμῶν, καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον πάσης ψυχῆς ζώσης ἐν πάσῃ σαρκί, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ἔτι τὸ ὕδωρ εἰς κατακλυσμόν, ὥστε ἐξαλεῖψαι πᾶσαν σάρκα·
16 καὶ ἔσται τὸ τόξον μου ἐν τῇ νεφέλῃ, καὶ ὄψομαι τοῦ μνησθῆναι διαθήκην αἰώνιον ἀνὰ μέσον ἐμοῦ, καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον πάσης ψυχῆς ζώσης ἐν πάσῃ σαρκί, ἥ ἐστιν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς.
17 Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ Θεὸς τῷ Νῶε· τοῦτο τὸ σημεῖον τῆς διαθήκης, ἧς διεθέμην ἀνὰ μέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον πάσης σαρκός, ἥ ἐστιν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς.
18 Ἦσαν δὲ οἱ υἱοὶ Νῶε οἱ ἐξελθόντες ἐκ τῆς κιβωτοῦ, Σήμ, Χάμ, Ἰάφεθ· Χὰμ δὲ ἦν πατὴρ Χαναάν.
19 Τρεῖς οὗτοί εἰσιν οἱ υἱοὶ Νῶε· ἀπὸ τούτων διεσπάρησαν ἐπὶ πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν.
20 Καὶ ἤρξατο Νῶε ἄνθρωπος γεωργὸς γῆς, καὶ ἐφύτευσεν ἀμπελῶνα·
21 καὶ ἔπιεν ἐκ τοῦ οἴνου, καὶ ἐμεθύσθη, καὶ ἐγυμνώθη ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ.
22 Καὶ ἴδε Χὰμ ὁ πατὴρ Χαναὰν τὴν γύμνωσιν τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐξελθὼν ἀνήγγειλε τοῖς δυσὶν ἀδελφοῖς αὐτοῦ ἔξω.
23 Καὶ λαβόντες Σὴμ καὶ Ἰάφεθ τὸ ἱμάτιον, ἐπέθηκαν ἐπὶ τὰ δύο νῶτα αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν ὀπισθοφανῶς, καὶ συνεκάλυψαν τὴν γύμνωσιν τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῶν τῷ προσώπῳ αὐτῶν ὀπισθοφανῶς, καὶ τὴν γύμνωσιν τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῶν οὐκ ἴδον.

**Genesis 9**

5
Ye shall eat thereof. For indeed your blood of your lives will I require;
from the hand of every beast will I require it;
and from the hand of man, and from the hand of a man, his brother,
will I require the life of man.

6
Whoso sheddeth the blood of man,
in exchange for that blood, his own blood shall be poured out;
for in the image of God made I man.

7
But as for you, be ye fruitful and multiply;
and fill the earth, and multiply upon the earth.

8
And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying:

9
Behold, I do establish My covenant with you,
and with your seed after you;

10
And with every living creature that is with you,
of the fowl, and of the cattle,
and with all the beasts of the earth,
even all that are with you, of all those
11
That went forth from the ark:
and I will establish My covenant with you,
that all flesh shall not be cut off any more by the water of a flood;
neither shall there be any more a flood of water
to destroy all the earth.

12
And the Lord God said unto Noah,
“This is the token of the covenant
which I make between Me and you,
and between every living creature that is with you,
for perpetual generations:

13
My bow do I set in the cloud;
and it shall be for a token of a covenant between Me and the earth.

14
And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth,
that the bow shall be seen in the cloud.

15
And I will remember My covenant,
which is between Me and you,
and between every living creature in all flesh;
and the waters shall no more become a flood
to destroy all flesh.

16
And the bow shall be in the cloud;
and I will look upon it, that I may remember
the everlasting covenant between Me,
and between every living creature in all flesh
that is upon the earth.”

17
And God said unto Noah,
“This is the token of the covenant,
which I have established between Me,
and between all flesh that is upon the earth.”

18
And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth;
and Ham was the father of Canaan.

19
These are the three sons of Noah;
and of them was the whole earth overspread.

20
And Noah began to be a man, a husbandman of the earth,
and he planted a vineyard.

21
And he drank of the wine, and was drunken;
and he was uncovered within his dwelling.

22
And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father,
and went out, and told his two brethren without.

23
And Shem and Japheth took a garment,
and laid it upon both their shoulders;
and they went backward,
and covered the nakedness of their father with their faces turned backward;
and they saw not their father’s nakedness.
