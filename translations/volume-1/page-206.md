LEVITICUS, CHAPTER 11

26 ...[they are] unto you [unclean]; whosoever toucheth [of] their carcasses shall be unclean [until the evening].

27 And every beast that moveth upon its hands, among all the animals that move upon four [feet], these are unclean unto you: whosoever toucheth their carcasses shall be unclean until the evening.

28 And he that beareth away their carcasses shall wash his garments, and be unclean until the evening; these things are unclean unto you.

29 And these are unto you unclean among the creeping things that creep upon the earth: the weasel, and the mouse, and the Gerkaian lizard, and their kind;

30 the shrew, and the chameleon, and the gecko-lizard, and the shrew-mouse, and the mole.

31 These [are] unclean unto you among all the creeping things that are upon the earth: whosoever toucheth them, being dead, shall be unclean until the evening.

32 And upon whatsoever any of them, being dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or garment, or skin, or sackcloth; every vessel whereon any work is wrought, it shall be plunged into water, and it shall be unclean until the evening, and so shall it be clean.

33 And every earthen vessel, into which any of these shall fall within it, whatsoever is therein, shall be unclean; and the vessel itself shall be broken.

34 And all food that is eaten, upon which water cometh, it shall be unclean: and all drink that is drunk in any vessel, it shall be unclean.

35 And every thing whereupon any of their carcasses shall fall, it shall be unclean; ovens and ranges for pots shall be broken down: they are unclean, and [these] shall be unclean unto you.

36 Nevertheless, fountains of water and a cistern and a gathering of water shall be clean: but whosoever toucheth their carcasses shall be unclean.

37 And if any of their carcasses shall fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it is clean.

38 But if water be poured upon any seed, and any of their carcasses shall fall upon it, it is unclean unto you.

39 And if any of the beasts, which are unto you for food, do die, he that toucheth their carcasses shall be unclean until the evening.

40 And he that eateth of these carcasses shall wash his garments, [and shall bathe himself with water], and be unclean until the evening: and he that beareth away of their carcasses shall wash his garments, [and shall bathe himself with water], and be unclean until the evening.

41 And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, this shall be an abomination unto you; it shall not be eaten.

42 And whatsoever goeth upon its belly, and whatsoever goeth upon four [feet],
