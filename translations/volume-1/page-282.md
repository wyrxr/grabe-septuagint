ΚΕΦ. ΙΖ΄. XVII.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, λέγων·
2 λάλησον τοῖς υἱοῖς ᾿Ισραήλ, καὶ λάβε παρ᾿ αὐτῶν ῥάβδον, ῥάβδον κατ᾿ οἴκους πατριῶν (αὐτῶν) παρὰ πάντων τῶν ἀρχόντων αὐτῶν, κατ᾿ οἴκους πατριῶν αὐτῶν, δώδεκα ῥάβδους· ἑκάστου τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ ἐπίγραφον ἐπὶ τῆς ῥάβδου αὐτοῦ.
3 Καὶ τὸ ὄνομα ᾿Ααρὼν ἐπίγραφον ἐπὶ τῆς ῥάβδου Λευί· ἔστι γὰρ ῥάβδος μία, κατὰ φυλὴν οἴκου πατριῶν αὐτῶν δώσουσι.
4 Καὶ θήσεις αὐτὰς ἐν τῇ σκηνῇ τοῦ μαρτυρίου, κατέναντι τοῦ μαρτυρίου, ἐν οἷς γνωσθήσομαί σοι ἐκεῖ.
5 Καὶ ἔσται ὁ ἄνθρωπος ὃν ἂν ἐκλέξωμαι αὐτόν, ἡ ῥάβδος αὐτοῦ ἐκβλαστήσει· καὶ περιελῶ ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ τὸν γογγυσμὸν υἱῶν ᾿Ισραήλ, ὅσα αὐτοὶ γογγύζουσιν ἐφ᾿ ὑμῖν.
6 Καὶ ἐλάλησε Μωυσῆς τοῖς υἱοῖς ᾿Ισραήλ· καὶ ἔδωκαν αὐτῷ πάντες οἱ ἄρχοντες αὐτῶν ῥάβδον, τῷ ἄρχοντι τῷ ἑνὶ ῥάβδον κατὰ ἄρχοντα ἕνα, κατ᾿ οἴκους πατριῶν αὐτῶν, δώδεκα ῥάβδους· καὶ ἡ ῥάβδος ᾿Ααρὼν ἀναμέσον τῶν ῥάβδων αὐτῶν.
7 Καὶ ἀπέθηκε Μωυσῆς τὰς ῥάβδους ἔναντι Κυρίου εἰς τὴν σκηνὴν τοῦ μαρτυρίου.
8 Καὶ ἐγένετο τῇ ἐπαύριον, καὶ εἰσῆλθε Μωυσῆς καὶ ᾿Ααρὼν ἐν τῇ σκηνῇ τοῦ μαρτυρίου· καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐβλάστησεν ἡ ῥάβδος ἡ ᾿Ααρὼν εἰς οἶκον Λευί, καὶ ἐξήνεγκε βλαστόν, καὶ ἐξήνθησεν ἄνθη, καὶ ἐβλάστησε κάρυα.
9 Καὶ ἐξήνεγκε Μωυσῆς πάσας τὰς ῥάβδους ἀπὸ προσώπου Κυρίου πρὸς πάντας υἱοὺς ᾿Ισραήλ· καὶ εἶδον, καὶ ἔλαβον ἕκαστος τὴν ῥάβδον αὐτοῦ.
10 Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν· ἀπόθες τὴν ῥάβδον ᾿Ααρὼν ἐνώπιον τῶν μαρτυρίων εἰς διατήρησιν, εἰς σημεῖον τοῖς υἱοῖς τῶν ἀνηκόων· καὶ παύσασθω ὁ γογγυσμὸς αὐτῶν ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἀποθάνωσι.
11 Καὶ ἐποίησε Μωυσῆς καὶ ᾿Ααρών· ὅσα συνέταξε Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ, οὕτως ἐποίησαν.
12 Καὶ εἶπαν οἱ υἱοὶ ᾿Ισραὴλ πρὸς Μωυσῆν, λέγοντες· ἰδοὺ ἐξηντλώμεθα, ἀπολώλαμεν πάντες, ἡμεῖς παρανηλώμεθα·
13 πᾶς ὁ ἁπτόμενος τῆς σκηνῆς Κυρίου, ἀποθνήσκει· ἕως εἰς τέλος ἀποθάνωμεν;

**Chapter 16 (continued)**

49 [from the midst of] the living; and the plague was stayed.
And they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred,
besides them that died because of Korah.
50 And Aaron returned unto Moses at the door of the tabernacle of testimony,
and the plague was stayed.

**Chapter 17**

1 Then the Lord spake unto Moses, saying:
2 "Speak thou unto the children of Israel,
and take of them a rod, [even] a rod for each house of the fathers (of them),
from all their princes, according to their fathers' houses, twelve rods;
and the name of each man shalt thou write upon his rod.
3 And the name of Aaron shalt thou write upon the rod of Levi;
for there is one rod, [and] they shall give [each rod] according to the tribe of their fathers' houses.
4 And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of testimony,
before the testimony, wherein I will make Myself known unto thee there.
5 And it shall be, that the man whomsoever I shall choose him,
his rod shall bud forth;
and I will remove from Myself the murmuring of the children of Israel,
which they murmur against you."
6 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel;
and all their princes gave him a rod, even a rod for each prince,
according to their fathers' houses, twelve rods [in all];
and the rod of Aaron was in the midst of their rods.
7 And Moses laid up the rods before the Lord in the tabernacle of testimony.
8 And it came to pass on the morrow,
that Moses and Aaron entered into the tabernacle of testimony;
and behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi had budded,
and brought forth a sprout, and blossomed flowers, and produced almonds.
9 And Moses brought out all the rods from before the Lord unto all the children of Israel;
and they saw, and each man took his rod.
10 And the Lord said unto Moses,
"Lay up the rod of Aaron before the testimonies for a perpetual preservation,
for a sign to the sons of the disobedient;
and let their murmuring cease from Me,
that they may not die."
11 And Moses and Aaron did so;
as the Lord commanded Moses, so did they.
12 And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying,
"Behold, we are utterly spent, we have all perished, we are completely consumed.
13 Whosoever toucheth the tabernacle of the Lord, he dieth;
shall we then die, even to the utter end?"
