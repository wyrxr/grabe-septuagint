13 ὑμῶν; δότε ἑαυτοῖς ἄνδρας σοφοὺς καὶ ἐπιστήμονας καὶ συνετοὺς εἰς τὰς φυλὰς ὑμῶν, καὶ καταστήσω αὐτοὺς ἐφ᾽ ὑμᾶς ἡγουμένους ὑμῶν.
14 Καὶ ἀπεκρίθητέ μοι, καὶ εἴπατε· καλὸν τὸ ῥῆμα ὃ ἐλάλησας ποιῆσαι.
15 Καὶ ἔλαβον τοὺς ἀρχιφύλους ἐξ ὑμῶν ἄνδρας σοφοὺς καὶ ἐπιστήμονας καὶ συνετοὺς, καὶ κατέστησα αὐτοὺς ἡγεῖσθαι ἐφ᾽ ὑμῶν χιλιάρχους, καὶ ἑκατοντάρχους, καὶ πεντηκοντάρχους, καὶ
16 δεκαδάρχους, καὶ γραμματοεισαγωγεῖς τοῖς κριταῖς ὑμῶν. Καὶ ἐνετειλάμην τοῖς κριταῖς ὑμῶν ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ, λέγων· διακούετε ἀναμέσον τῶν ἀδελφῶν ὑμῶν, καὶ κρίνετε δικαίως ἀναμέσον ἀνδρὸς καὶ ἀναμέσον τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀναμέσον προσηλύτου αὐτοῦ.
17 Οὐκ ἐπιγνώσεσθε πρόσωπον ἐν κρίσει, κατὰ τὸν μικρὸν καὶ κατὰ τὸν μέγαν κρινεῖς, οὐ μὴ ὑποστείλῃ πρόσωπον ἀνθρώπου, ὅτι ἡ κρίσις τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐστι· καὶ τὸ ῥῆμα ὃ ἐὰν ᾖ σκληρὸν ἀφ᾽ ὑμῶν, ἀνοίσετε αὐτὸ ἐπ᾽ ἐμὲ, καὶ ἀκούσομαι αὐτό.
18 Καὶ ἐνετειλάμην ὑμῖν ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ τοὺς πάντας λόγους, οὓς ποιήσετε.
19 Καὶ ἀπάραντες ἐκ Χωρήβ, ἐπορεύθημεν πᾶσαν τὴν ἔρημον τὴν μεγάλην καὶ τὴν φοβερὰν ἐκείνην, ἣν εἴδετε ὁδὸν ὄρους τοῦ Ἀμορραίου, καθότι ἐνετείλατο Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν ἡμῖν· καὶ ἤλθομεν ἕως Κάδης Βαρνή.
20 Καὶ εἶπα πρὸς ὑμᾶς· ἤλθατε ἕως ὄρους τοῦ Ἀμορραίου, ὃ ὁ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν δίδωσιν ἡμῖν.
21 Ἴδετε, παρέδωκε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν πρὸ προσώπου ὑμῶν τὴν γῆν· ἀναβάντες κληρονομεῖτε, ὃν τρόπον εἶπε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τῶν πατέρων ὑμῶν ὑμῖν· μὴ φοβεῖσθε, μηδὲ δειλιάσητε.
22 Καὶ προσήλθατέ μοι πάντες ὑμεῖς, καὶ εἴπατε· ἀποστείλωμεν ἄνδρας προτέρους ἡμῶν, καὶ ἐφοδευσάτωσαν ἡμῖν τὴν γῆν, καὶ ἀναγγειλάτωσαν ἡμῖν ἀπόκρισιν, τὴν ὁδὸν δι᾽ ἧς ἀναβησόμεθα ἐν αὐτῇ, καὶ τὰς πόλεις εἰς ἃς εἰσπορευσόμεθα εἰς αὐτάς.
23 Καὶ ἤρεσεν ἐνώπιόν μου τὸ ῥῆμα, καὶ ἔλαβον ἐξ ὑμῶν δώδεκα ἄνδρας, ἄνδρα ἕνα κατὰ φυλήν.
24 Καὶ ἐπιστραφέντες ἀνέβησαν εἰς τὸ ὄρος, καὶ ἤλθοσαν ἕως φάραγγος βότρυος, καὶ κατεσκόπευσαν αὐτήν·
25 καὶ ἔλαβον ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτῶν ἀπὸ τοῦ καρποῦ τῆς γῆς, καὶ κατήνεγκαν πρὸς ἡμᾶς, καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν ἡμῖν ῥῆμα, καὶ ἔλεγον· ἀγαθὴ ἡ γῆ, ἣν Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν δίδωσιν ἡμῖν.
26 Καὶ οὐκ ἠθελήσατε ἀναβῆναι, ἀλλ᾽ ἠπειθήσατε τῷ ῥήματι Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ὑμῶν·
27 καὶ διεγογγύσατε ἐν ταῖς σκηναῖς ὑμῶν, καὶ εἴπατε· διὰ τὸ μισεῖν Κύριον ἡμᾶς, ἐξήγαγεν ἡμᾶς ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, παραδοῦναι ἡμᾶς εἰς τὰς χεῖρας

### Literary English Translation

**DEUTERONOMY CHAPTER 1**

13 [from among] you? Give ye unto yourselves men wise and knowing and understanding, from among your tribes, and I shall appoint them over you to be your leaders.

14 And ye answered me, and said, "Good is the word which thou hast spoken, that we should do it."

15 So I took the chief men of your tribes, men wise and knowing and understanding, and I appointed them to be leaders over you: captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens, and those who brought forth the records unto your judges.

16 And I charged your judges at that time, saying, "Hear ye out all cases among your brethren, and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and between his sojourner.

17 Ye shall not show partiality in judgment; ye shall judge the small and the great alike. Thou shalt not shrink from the face of any man, for the judgment is God's. And the matter which is too hard for you, ye shall bring it unto me, and I will hear it."

18 And I commanded you at that time all the words which ye should do.

19 And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and fearsome wilderness which ye saw, by the way of the mountain of the Amorite, as the Lord our God commanded us; and we came unto Kadesh Barnea.

20 And I said unto you, "Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorite, which the Lord our God doth give unto us.

21 Behold, the Lord your God hath set the land before you; go up and possess it, as the Lord God of your fathers hath spoken unto you. Fear ye not, neither be ye dismayed."

22 And ye came near unto me, every one of you, and said, "Let us send men before us, that they may search out the land for us, and bring us word again concerning the way by which we must go up into it, and the cities into which we shall enter, into them."

23 And the word pleased me well; and I took twelve men from among you, one man for each tribe.

24 And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the Valley of Eshcol, and spied it out.

25 And they took in their hands of the fruit of the land, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, saying, "Good is the land which the Lord our God doth give us."

26 Nevertheless ye would not go up, but rebelled against the word of the Lord your God;

27 and ye murmured in your tents, and said, "Because the Lord hated us, hath He brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand [of the Amorites, that He might destroy us]."
