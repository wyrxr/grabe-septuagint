αὐτὸ πρὸς τὴν θυγατέρα Φαραώ· καὶ ἐγενήθη αὐτῇ εἰς υἱόν. Ἐ
πωνόμασε δὲ τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Μωυσῆν, λέγουσα· ὅτι ἐκ τοῦ ὕδατος
11 ἀνειλόμην αὐτόν. Εγένετο δὲ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ταῖς πολλαῖς
ἐκείναις, μέγας γενόμενος Μωυσῆς ἐξῆλθε πρὸς τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐ
τοῦ, τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραήλ. Κατανοήσας δὲ τὸν πόνον αὐτῶν, ὁρᾷ
ἄνθρωπον Αἰγύπτιον τύπτοντα τινὰ Ἑβραῖον τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτοῦ,
12 τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ. Περιβλεψάμενος δὲ ὧδε καὶ ὧδε, οὐχ ὁρᾷ οὐδένα·
καὶ πατάξας τὸν Αἰγύπτιον, ἔκρυψεν αὐτὸν ἐν τῇ ἄμμῳ.
13 Ἐξελθὼν δὲ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ δευτέρᾳ, ὁρᾷ δύο ἄνδρας Ἑβραίους διαπληκτιζομένους·
καὶ λέγει τῷ ἀδικοῦντι· διατί τύπτεις τὸν πλη
14 σίον; Ὁ δὲ εἶπε· τίς σὲ κατέστησεν ἄρχοντα καὶ δικαστὴν ἐφ᾿
ἡμῶν; ἢ ἀνελεῖν με σὺ θέλεις, ὃν τρόπον ἀνεῖλες τὸν Αἰγύπτιον
χθές; Ἐφοβήθη δὲ Μωυσῆς, καὶ εἶπεν· εἰ οὕτως ἐμφανὲς γέγονε
15 τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο; Ἤκουσε δὲ Φαραὼ τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο, καὶ
ἐζήτει ἀνελεῖν Μωυσῆν. ᾿Ανεχώρησε δὲ Μωυσῆς ἀπὸ προσώπου
Φαραὼ, καὶ κατώκησεν ἐν γῇ Μαδιάμ· ἐλθὼν δὲ εἰς γῆν Μαδιάμ,
16 ἐκάθισεν ἐπὶ τοῦ φρέατος. Τῷ δὲ ἱερεῖ Μαδιὰμ ἦσαν ἑπτὰ
θυγατέρες, ποιμαίνουσαι τὰ πρόβατα Ἰοθὸρ τοῦ πατρὸς αὑτῶν·
παραγενόμεναι δὲ ἤντλουν ἕως ἔπλησαν τὰς δεξαμενὰς, ποτίσαι
17 τὰ πρόβατα τοῦ πατρὸς αὑτῶν Ἰοθόρ. Παραγενόμενοι δὲ οἱ ποιμένες,
ἐξέβαλλον αὐτάς· ἀναστὰς δὲ Μωυσῆς ἐῤῥύσατο αὐτὰς, καὶ
18 ἐπότισε τὰ πρόβατα αὐτῶν. Παρεγένοντο δὲ πρὸς Ἰοθόρ τὸν πατέρα
αὑτῶν· ὁ δὲ εἶπεν αὐταῖς· τί ὅτι ἐταχύνατε τοῦ παραγενέ-
19 σθαι σήμερον; Αἱ δὲ εἶπον· ἄνθρωπος Αἰγύπτιος ἐῤῥύσατο ἡμᾶς
ἀπὸ τῶν ποιμένων, καὶ ἤντλησεν ἡμῖν καὶ ἐπότισε τὰ πρόβατα.
20 Ὁ δὲ εἶπε ταῖς θυγατράσιν αὑτοῦ· καὶ ποῦ ἐστι; καὶ ἱνατί οὕτω
καταλελοίπατε τὸν ἄνθρωπον; καλέσατε οὖν αὐτὸν, ὅπως φάγῃ
21 ἄρτον. Κατῳκίσθη δὲ Μωυσῆς παρὰ τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ· καὶ ἐξέδοτο
22 Σεπφώραν τὴν θυγατέρα αὑτοῦ Μωυσεῖ γυναῖκα. Ἐν γαστρὶ δὲ
λαβοῦσα ἡ γυνὴ, ἔτεκεν υἱὸν, καὶ ἐπωνόμασε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ,
23 Γηρσάμ, λέγων· πάροικός εἰμι ἐν γῇ ἀλλοτρίᾳ. Μετὰ δὲ τὰς ἡμέρας
τὰς πολλὰς ἐκείνας, ἐτελεύτησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Αἰγύπτου· καὶ
κατεστέναξαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἀπὸ τῶν ἔργων, καὶ ἀνεβόησαν· καὶ
24 ἀνέβη ἡ βοὴ αὐτῶν πρὸς τὸν Θεὸν ἀπὸ τῶν ἔργων. Καὶ εἰσήκουσεν
ὁ Θεὸς τὸν στεναγμὸν αὐτῶν· καὶ ἐμνήσθη ὁ Θεὸς τῆς

**CHAPTER 2**

him unto Pharaoh’s daughter; and he became unto her a son.
And she called his name Moses, saying,
“Because out of the water I drew him.”

11 Now it came to pass in those many days,
when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren,
the children of Israel.
And when he beheld their hard toil,
he saw an Egyptian man smiting a certain Hebrew of his brethren,
even of the children of Israel.
12 And looking round about on this side and on that side,
he saw no one;
and when he had smitten the Egyptian,
he hid him in the sand.
13 And when he went out on the second day,
he beheld two Hebrew men contending;
and he said unto him that did the wrong,
“Wherefore smitest thou thy neighbor?”
14 And he said,
“Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?
Or dost thou desire to slay me,
in the manner thou didst slay the Egyptian yesterday?”
Then Moses feared, and said,
“Surely this thing has indeed become known!”
15 Now Pharaoh heard this thing,
and he sought to slay Moses.
But Moses withdrew from the presence of Pharaoh,
and dwelt in the land of Midian;
and when he was come into the land of Midian,
he sat down by the well.
16 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters,
who were tending the sheep of Jothor their father;
and they came and drew water until they filled the troughs,
to water the sheep of Jothor their father.
17 And when the shepherds came,
they drove them away;
but Moses rose up and rescued them,
and watered their sheep.
18 And they came to Jothor their father;
and he said unto them,
“How is it that ye have made such haste to come hither today?”
19 And they said,
“An Egyptian man rescued us from the shepherds,
and drew water for us, and watered the sheep.”
20 And he said unto his daughters,
“And where is he?
And why have ye thus left the man?
Call him therefore, that he may eat bread.”
21 And Moses was content to dwell with the man;
and he gave Zipporah his daughter to Moses to be his wife.
22 And the woman conceived and bare a son,
and she called his name Gershom,
for [he] said,
“I am a sojourner in a foreign land.”
23 And it came to pass after those many days,
that the king of Egypt died;
and the children of Israel groaned because of their labors,
and they cried out;
and their cry ascended unto God because of their labors.
24 And God heard their groaning;
and God remembered His
