10 τίσει διπλοῦν τῷ πλησίον αὐτοῦ. Ἐὰν δέ τις δῷ τῷ πλησίον ὑποζύγιον ἢ πρόβατον ἢ μόσχον ἢ πᾶν κτῆνος φυλάξαι, καὶ τελευτήσῃ ἢ συντριβῇ ἢ αἰχμάλωτον γένηται, καὶ μηδεὶς γνῷ, ὅρκος 11 ἔσται τοῦ θεοῦ ἀνὰ μέσον ἀμφοτέρων, ἢ μὴν μὴ αὐτὸν πεπονηρεῦσθαι ἐφ᾿ ὅλης τῆς παρακαταθήκης τοῦ πλησίον, καὶ οὕτω προσδέξεται ὁ κύριος αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἀποτίσει· 12 ἐὰν δὲ κλαπῇ παρ᾿ αὐτοῦ, ἀποτίσει τῷ κυρίῳ αὐτοῦ. 13 Ἐὰν δὲ θηριάλωτον γένηται, ἄξει αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὴν θήραν, καὶ οὐκ ἀποτίσει. 14 Ἐὰν δὲ αἴτησις τις παρὰ τοῦ πλησίον, καὶ συντριβῇ ἢ ἀποθάνῃ ἢ αἰχμάλωτον γένηται, ὁ δὲ κύριος αὐτοῦ μὴ ᾖ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, ἀποτιννύων ἀποτίσει· 15 ἐὰν δὲ ὁ κύριος αὐτοῦ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ᾖ, οὐκ ἀποτίσει· ἐὰν δὲ μισθωτός ᾖ, ἔσται αὐτῷ ἀντὶ τοῦ μισθοῦ αὐτοῦ. 16 Ἐὰν δὲ ἀπατήσῃ τις παρθένον ἀμνήστευτον, καὶ κοιμηθῇ μετ᾿ αὐτῆς, φερνῇ φερνιεῖ αὐτὴν αὐτῷ εἰς γυναῖκα. 17 Ἐὰν δὲ ἀνανεύων ἀνανεύσῃ, καὶ μὴ βούληται ὁ πατὴρ αὐτῆς δοῦναι αὐτὴν αὐτῷ γυναῖκα, ἀργύριον ἀποτίσει αὐτῷ καθ᾿ ὅσον ἐστὶν ἡ φερνὴ τῶν παρθένων. 18 Φαρμακεὺς οὐ περιθιώσετε. 19 Πᾶν κοιμώμενον μετὰ κτήνους, θανάτῳ ἀποκτενεῖται. 20 Ὁ θυσιάζων θεοῖς ( ἑτέροις), ἐξολοθρευθήσεται, πλὴν Κυρίῳ μόνῳ. 21 Καὶ προσήλυτον οὐ κακώσετε, οὔτε μὴ θλίψετε αὐτόν· ἦτε γὰρ προσήλυτοι ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ. 22 Πᾶσαν χήραν καὶ ὀρφανὸν οὐ κακώσετε· 23 ἐὰν δὲ κακίᾳ κακώσητε αὐτούς, καὶ κεκράξωντες καταβοήσωσι πρός με, ἀκοῇ εἰσακούσομαι τῆς φωνῆς αὐτῶν, καὶ ὀργισθήσομαι θυμῷ, καὶ ἀποκτενῶ ὑμᾶς ἐν μαχαίρᾳ, καὶ ἔσονται αἱ γυναῖκες ὑμῶν χῆραι, καὶ τὰ παιδία ὑμῶν ὀρφανά. 25 Ἐὰν δὲ ἀργύριον ἐκδανείσῃς τῷ ἀδελφῷ τῷ πενιχρῷ παρὰ σοί, οὐκ ἔσῃ αὐτὸν κατεπείγων· οὐκ ἐπιθήσεις αὐτῷ τόκον. 26 Ἐὰν δὲ ἐνεγύρασμα ἐνεχυράσῃς τὸ ἱμάτιον τοῦ πλησίον, πρὸ δυσμῶν ἡλίου ἀποδώσεις αὐτὸ αὐτῷ· 27 ἔστι γὰρ τοῦτο περιβόλαιον αὐτοῦ, μόνον τοῦτο τὸ ἱμάτιον ἀσχημοσύνης αὐτοῦ, ἐν τίνι κοιμηθήσεται; Ἐὰν οὖν καταβοήσῃ πρός με, εἰσακούσομαι αὐτοῦ· ἐλεήμων γάρ εἰμι. 28 Θεοὺς οὐ κακολογήσεις, καὶ ἄρχοντα τοῦ λαοῦ σου οὐκ ἐρεῖς κακῶς. 29 Ἀπαρχὰς ἅλωνος καὶ ληνοῦ σου οὐ καθυστερήσεις· τὰ πρωτότοκα τῶν υἱῶν σου δώσεις ἐμοί. 30 Οὕτω ποιήσεις τὸν μόσχον σου καὶ τὸ πρόβατόν σου καὶ τὸ ὑποζύγιόν σου· ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας ἔσται ὑπὸ τὴν μητέρα αὐτοῦ, τῇ δὲ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ὀγδόῃ δώσεις μοι αὐτό.

### Chapter 22

10 ...he shall pay double unto his neighbour.

If a man give unto his neighbour an ass, or a sheep, or an ox, or any beast to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or be taken captive, and no one knoweth it: 11 then an oath of the Lord shall be between them both, that indeed he hath not done evil against all the deposit of his neighbour. And so shall its owner accept it, and he shall not make restitution.

12 But if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto its owner.

13 And if it be torn by wild beasts, he shall bring it for proof, and he shall not make restitution.

14 And if a man borrow aught of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or die, or be taken captive, and its owner be not with it, he shall surely make restitution. 15 But if its owner be with it, he shall not make restitution. If it be a hired thing, it shall be accounted as its hire.

16 If a man deceive a virgin who is not espoused, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her with a dowry for himself to be his wife. 17 But if her father utterly refuse and be unwilling to give her unto him to be his wife, he shall pay him money according to the dowry of virgins.

18 A sorcerer, ye shall not suffer to live.

19 Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.

20 He that sacrificeth unto [other] gods shall be utterly destroyed, save unto the Lord alone.

21 And ye shall not vex a sojourner, neither shall ye afflict him; for ye were sojourners in the land of Egypt.

22 Ye shall not vex any widow, nor any orphan. 23 But if ye afflict them with evil, and they cry out unto Me, I will surely hear the voice of their crying, and I will be wroth with anger, and I will slay you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children orphans.

25 If thou lend money to thy brother, a poor man with thee, thou shalt not be pressing him; thou shalt not lay interest upon him.

26 If thou take thy neighbour's garment as a pledge, thou shalt restore it unto him before the setting of the sun; 27 for this is his covering, this alone is the garment of his nakedness; wherein shall he sleep? Therefore, if he cry unto Me, I will hearken unto him; for I am merciful.

28 Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor shalt thou speak evil of a ruler of thy people.

29 Thou shalt not delay to offer thy firstfruits of thy threshing-floor and of thy winepress. The firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto Me.

30 Thus shalt thou do with thy calf, and with thy lamb, and with thy young ass: seven days shall it be under its mother; but on the eighth day shalt thou give it unto Me.
