λειτουργεῖν ἐν αὐταῖς ἐν τῷ ἁγίῳ. Καὶ ἤνεγκαν τὰς στολὰς πρὸς
Μωυσῆν, καὶ τὴν σκηνὴν, καὶ τὰ σκεύη αὐτῆς, καὶ τοὺς μοχλοὺς,
καὶ τοὺς στύλους, καὶ τὰς βάσεις αὐτῆς· καὶ τὴν κιβωτὸν τῆς
διαθήκης, καὶ τοὺς διωστήρας αὐτῆς· καὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον, καὶ πάν-
τα τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ· καὶ τὸ ἔλαιον τῆς χρίσεως, καὶ τὸ θυμίαμα
τῆς συνθέσεως· καὶ τὴν λυχνίαν τὴν καθαρὰν, καὶ τοὺς λύχνους
αὐτῆς, λύχνους τῆς καύσεως, καὶ τὸ ἔλαιον τοῦ φωτός· καὶ τὴν
τράπεζαν τῆς προθέσεως, καὶ πάντα αὐτῆς τὰ σκεύη, καὶ τοὺς
ἄρτους τῆς προθέσεως· καὶ τὰς στολὰς τοῦ ἁγίου, αἳ εἰσιν Ἀα̈ρὼν,
καὶ τὰς στολὰς τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ εἰς τὴν ἱερατείαν· καὶ τὰ
ἱστία τῆς αὐλῆς, καὶ τοὺς στύλους καὶ τὰς βάσεις αὐτῆς, καὶ τὸ
καταπέτασμα τῆς θύρας τῆς σκηνῆς, καὶ τὰς πύλης τῆς αὐλῆς·
καὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη τῆς σκηνῆς, καὶ τὰ ἐργαλεῖα αὐτῆς· καὶ τὰς
διφθέρας δέρματα κριῶν ἠρυθροδανωμένα, καὶ τὰ κατακαλύμματα δέρ-
ματα ὑακίνθινα, καὶ τῶν λοιπῶν τὰ ἐπικαλύμματα· καὶ τοὺς πασ-
σάλους, καὶ πάντα τὰ ἐργαλεῖα τὰ εἰς ἔργα τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ
μαρτυρίου. Ὅσα συνέταξε Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ, οὕτως ἐποίησαν οἱ
υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ πᾶσαν τὴν παρασκευήν. Καὶ ἰδὲ Μωυσῆς πάντα τὰ
ἔργα, καὶ ἦσαν πεποιηκότες αὐτὰ, ὃν τρόπον συνέταξε Κύριος τῷ
Μωυσῇ, οὕτως ἐποίησαν αὐτά· καὶ ηὐλόγησεν αὐτοὺς Μωυσῆς.

and the pillars, and its bases; and the ark of the covenant,
and its staves; and the altar, and all its furnishings;
and the oil of anointing, and the incense of composition;
and the pure lampstand, and its lamps, even the lamps of burning,
and the oil for the light; and the table of the Presence,
and all its furnishings, and the loaves of the Presence;
and the holy vestments, which are Aaron’s, and the vestments
of his sons for the priesthood; and the hangings of the court,
and its pillars and its bases, and the veil of the door of the tabernacle,
and the gates of the court; and all the furnishings of the tabernacle,
and its implements; and the hides, [even] the skins of rams dyed crimson,
and the coverings of hyacinth-colored skins, and the coverings of the rest;
and the pegs, and all the implements for the work of the tabernacle of witness.
According as the Lord commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel make all the preparation.
And Moses beheld all the works, and they had made them in the manner
that the Lord commanded Moses, so had they made them; and Moses blessed them.

before the ark of the testimony; and thou shalt set the curtain of the veil
upon the door of the tabernacle of witness.
⁶ And the altar of the burnt offerings shalt thou place beside the door of the tabernacle of witness.
⁷ And thou shalt set the laver betwixt the tabernacle of witness and the altar,
and there wert thou preserving water.
⁸ And thou shalt set up the court round about, and shalt place the hanging for the gate of the court.
⁹ And thou shalt take the oil of the
