διαθήκης αὐτοῦ τῆς πρὸς Ἀβραὰμ καὶ Ἰσαὰκ καὶ Ἰακώβ. Καὶ εἰσῖδεν 25
ὁ Θεὸς τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐγνώσθη αὐτοῖς.

ΚΕΦ. Γ΄. ΙΙΙ.

ΚΑΙ Μωυσῆς ἦν ποιμαίνων τὰ πρόβατα Ἰοθὸρ τοῦ γαμβροῦ 1
αὐτοῦ, τοῦ ἱερέως Μαδιάμ, καὶ ἦγε τὰ πρόβατα ὑπὸ τὴν ἔρημον·
καὶ ἦλθεν εἰς τὸ ὄρος τοῦ Θεοῦ, Χωρήβ. Ὄφθη δὲ αὐτῷ ἄγγελος 2
Κυρίου ἐν φλογὶ πυρὸς ἐκ τοῦ βάτου· καὶ ὁρᾷ ὅτι ὁ βάτος καίε-
ται πυρί, ὁ δὲ βάτος οὐ κατεκαίετο. Εἶπε δὲ Μωυσῆς· παρελθὼν 3
ἔψομαι τὸ ὅραμα τὸ μέγα τοῦτο, τί ὅτι οὐ κατακαίεται ὁ βάτος.
Ὡς δὲ ἴδε Κύριος ὅτι προσάγει ἰδεῖν, ἐκάλεσεν αὐτὸν Κύριος ἐκ 4
μέσου τοῦ βάτου, λέγων· Μωυσῆ, Μωυσῆ. Ὁ δὲ εἶπε· τί ἐστι;
Καὶ εἶπε· μὴ ἐγγίσῃς ὧδε· λῦσαι τὸ ὑπόδημά σου ἐκ τῶν πο- 5
δῶν σου· ὁ γὰρ τόπος, ἐν ᾧ σὺ ἔστηκας ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῦ, γῆ ἁγία ἐστί.
Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ πατρός σου, ὁ Θεὸς Ἀ- 6
βραάμ, καὶ Θεὸς Ἰσαάκ, καὶ Θεὸς Ἰακώβ. Ἀπέστρεψε δὲ Μωυ-
σῆς τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ· εὐλαβεῖτο γὰρ κατεμβλέψαι ἐνώπιον
τοῦ Θεοῦ. Εἶπε δὲ Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν· ἰδὼν ἴδον τὴν κάκω- 7
σιν τοῦ λαοῦ μου τοῦ ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ, καὶ τῆς κραυγῆς αὐτῶν ἀκή-
κοα ἀπὸ τῶν ἐργοδιωκτῶν· οἶδα γὰρ τὴν ὀδύνην αὐτῶν, καὶ κα- 8
τέβην τοῦ ἐξελέσθαι αὐτοὺς ἐκ χειρὸς Αἰγυπτίων, καὶ ἐξαγαγεῖν
αὐτοὺς ἐκ τῆς γῆς ἐκείνης εἰς γῆν ἀγαθὴν καὶ πολλήν, εἰς γῆν
ῥέουσαν γάλα καὶ μέλι, εἰς τὸν τόπον τῶν Χαναναιῶν, καὶ Χετ-
ταίων, καὶ Ἀμοῤῥαίων, καὶ Φερεζαίων, καὶ Εὐαίων, καὶ Γεργε-
σαίων, καὶ Ἰεβουσαίων. Καὶ νῦν ἰδοὺ κραυγὴ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ ἤ- 9
κει πρὸς με· καὶ ἐγὼ ἑώρακα τὸν θλιμμόν, ὃν οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι θλίβουσιν
αὐτούς. Καὶ νῦν δεῦρο ἀποστελῶ σε πρὸς Φαραὼ βασιλέα Αἰγύπτου, 10
καὶ ἐξάξεις τὸν λαόν μου τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου. Καὶ 11
εἶπε Μωυσῆς πρὸς τὸν Θεόν· τίς εἰμι ἐγώ, ὅτι πορεύσομαι πρὸς Φα-
ραὼ βασιλέα Αἰγύπτου; καὶ ὅτι ἐξάξω τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ ἐκ γῆς Αἰ-
γύπτου; Εἶπε δέ· ὅτι ἔσομαι μετὰ σοῦ. Καὶ τοῦτό σοι τὸ σημεῖον 12
ὅτι ἐγώ σε ἀποστέλλω· ἐν τῷ σε ἐξαγαγεῖν τὸν λαὸν ἐξ Αἰγύ-
πτου, καὶ λατρεύσετε τῷ Θεῷ ἐν τῷ ὄρει τούτῳ. Καὶ εἶπε Μωυ- 13
σῆς πρὸς τὸν Θεόν· ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐλεύσομαι πρὸς τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραήλ,
καὶ ἐρῶ πρὸς αὐτούς· ὁ Θεὸς τῶν πατέρων ὑμῶν ἀπέσταλκέ με
πρὸς ὑμᾶς. Καὶ ἐρωτήσουσι με· τί ὄνομα αὐτῷ; τί ἐρῶ πρὸς αὐ-
τούς;

**Exodus**

**Chapter 2**
25 his covenant which [He made] with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob. And God looked upon the sons of Israel, and was made manifest unto them.

**Chapter 3**
1 Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian; and he led the flock into the wilderness, and came unto the mountain of God, [even] Horeb.
2 And an Angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire from out of the bush; and he beholds that the bush did burn with fire, yet the bush was not consumed.
3 Then said Moses, "I will now turn aside and gaze upon this great vision, [to see] why the bush doth not consume."
4 And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, the Lord called unto him out of the midst of the bush, saying, "Moses, Moses." And he said, "What is it?"
5 And He said, "Draw not nigh hither. Loose thy sandals from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest, that ground is holy."
6 And He said unto him, "I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." And Moses turned his face away, for he was afraid to gaze intently before God.
7 And the Lord said unto Moses, "I have surely seen the affliction of My people who are in Egypt, and I have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters;
8 for I know their sorrow. And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a spacious, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.
9 And now, behold, the cry of the sons of Israel is come unto Me; and I have seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians do oppress them.
10 Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that thou mayest bring forth My people, [even] the sons of Israel, out of the land of Egypt."
11 And Moses said unto God, "Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and that I should bring forth the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt?"
12 And He said, "Surely I shall be with thee. And this [shall be] the sign unto thee, that I have sent thee: when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall worship God upon this very mountain."
13 And Moses said unto God, "Behold, I shall come unto the sons of Israel, and I shall say unto them, 'The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you.' And they shall say unto me, 'What is His name?' What shall I say unto them?"
