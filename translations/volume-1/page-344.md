## Deuteronomy

### Chapter 10

<sup>13</sup> [and] with all thy soul, to keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, and His ordinances, which I command thee this day, that it may be well with thee.
<sup>14</sup> Behold, to the LORD thy God belongeth the heaven, and the heaven of heavens, the earth, and all that therein is.
<sup>15</sup> Nevertheless, the LORD set His affection upon thy fathers to love them, and He chose their seed after them, even you, above all nations, even as it is this day.
<sup>16</sup> Circumcise therefore the hardness of your heart, and harden not your neck any more.
<sup>17</sup> For the LORD your God, He is God of gods, and Lord of lords, the great God, the mighty, and the dreadful, who regardeth not persons, neither doth He take a gift.
<sup>18</sup> He doth execute judgment for the sojourner, and the orphan, and the widow; and loveth the sojourner, to give him bread and raiment.
<sup>19</sup> Love ye therefore the sojourner; for ye were sojourners in Egypt.
<sup>20</sup> The LORD thy God shalt thou worship, and Him [alone] shalt thou serve, and unto Him shalt thou cleave, and by His name shalt thou swear.
<sup>21</sup> He is thy praise, and He is thy God, who hath wrought for thee these great and glorious things, which thine eyes have seen.
<sup>22</sup> With seventy [-five] souls did thy fathers go down into Egypt; but now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude.

### Chapter 11

<sup>1</sup> And thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep His charge, and His statutes, and His commandments, and His judgments continually.
<sup>2</sup> And know ye this day, for it is not with your children, who neither knew nor saw the discipline of the LORD your God, and His great deeds, and His mighty hand, and His exalted arm,
<sup>3</sup> and His signs and His wonders, all that He wrought in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land;
<sup>4</sup> and all that He wrought unto the might of the Egyptians, their chariots, and their horses; how He caused the water of the Red Sea to overflow their faces, when they pursued you from behind, and the LORD [God] destroyed them unto this very day;
<sup>5</sup> and all that He wrought for you in the wilderness, until ye came.
