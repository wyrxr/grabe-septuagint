26 αὐτῷ, καὶ ἔστησαν αὐτὸν ἀναμέσον τῶν δύο στύλων. Καὶ εἶπε Σαμψὼν πρὸς τὸ παιδάριον τὸν χειραγωγοῦντα αὐτόν· ἐπανάπαυσόν με δὴ, καὶ ποίησον ψηλαφῆσαί με ἐπὶ τοὺς στύλους, ἐφ᾿ ὧν ὁ οἶκος ἐπεστήρικτο ἐπ᾿ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπιστηρίσομαι ἐπ᾿ αὐτούς· ὁ δὲ παῖς
27 ἐποίησεν οὕτως. Ὁ δὲ οἶκος ἦν πλήρης ἀνδρῶν καὶ γυναικῶν, καὶ ἐκεῖ πάντες οἱ σατράπαι τῶν ἀλλοφύλων καὶ ἐπὶ τοῦ δώματος ὡσεὶ τρισχίλιοι ἄνδρες καὶ γυναῖκες, ἐμβλέποντες ἐμπαίζομενον
28 τὸν Σαμψών. Καὶ ἐβόησε Σαμψὼν πρὸς Κύριον, καὶ εἶπε· Κύριε Κύριε, μνήσθητι δὴ μου, καὶ ἐνίσχυσόν με δὴ πλὴν ἔτι τὸ ἅπαξ τοῦτο, καὶ ἐκδικήσω ἐκδίκησιν μίαν ἀντὶ τῶν δύο ὀφθαλμῶν μου
29 ἐκ τῶν ἀλλοφύλων. Καὶ περιέλαβε Σαμψὼν τοὺς δύο στύλους τοὺς μέσους, ἐφ᾿ ὧν ὁ οἶκος ἐπεστήρικτο ἐπ᾿ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπεστηρίσατο ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῖς, ἕνα ἐν τῇ δεξιᾷ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἕνα ἐν τῇ ἀριστερᾷ αὐτοῦ.
30 Καὶ εἶπε Σαμψών· ἀποθανέτω ἡ ψυχή μου μετὰ τῶν ἀλλοφύλων. Καὶ ἔκλινεν ἐν ἰσχύϊ, καὶ ἔπεσεν ὁ οἶκος ἐπὶ τοὺς σατράπας καὶ ἐπὶ πάντα τὸν λαὸν τὸν ἐν αὐτῷ, καὶ ἐγένοντο οἱ τεθνηκότες οὓς ἐθανάτωσε Σαμψὼν ἐν τῷ θανάτῳ αὐτοῦ, πλείους ὑπὲρ οὓς ἐθανάτωσεν ἐν τῇ ζωῇ αὐτοῦ.
31 Καὶ κατέβησαν οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ πᾶς ὁ οἶκος τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔλαβον αὐτόν· καὶ ἀνέβησαν, καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν ἀναμέσον Σαραὰ καὶ ἀναμέσον ᾿Εσθαόλ ἐν τῷ τάφῳ Μανωὲ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ. Καὶ αὐτὸς ἔκρινε τὸν ᾿Ισραὴλ εἴκοσιν ἔτη.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐγενήθη ἀνὴρ ἐξ ὄρους ᾿Εφραίμ, καὶ ὄνομα αὐτῷ Μειχά.
2 Καὶ εἶπε τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ· χιλίους καὶ ἑκατὸν ἀργυρίου τοὺς ληφθέντας σοι, καὶ ἐξώρκισας, καὶ εἶπας ἐν τοῖς ὠσί μου· ἰδοὺ τὸ ἀργύριον παρ᾿ ἐμοί, ἐγὼ ἔλαβον αὐτό. Καὶ εἶπεν ἡ μήτηρ

4 νῦν ἐπιστρέψω αὐτὰ σοι, (καὶ ἀποδώσω σοι αὐτό). Καὶ ἀπέδωκε τὸ ἀργύριον τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἔλαβεν ἡ μήτηρ αὐτοῦ διακοσίους τοῦ

**26.** ...unto him. And they set him between the two pillars. And Samson said unto the lad who guided him by the hand, "Cause me to rest now, and make me to feel the pillars, upon which the house was supported, [yea, even] upon them, that I may brace myself upon them." And the lad did so.

**27.** Now the house was full of men and women; and there were all the lords of the Philistines. And upon the roof were about three thousand men and women, beholding Samson making sport.

**29.** And Samson laid hold upon the two middle pillars, upon which the house was supported, [yea, even] upon them, and he leaned himself upon them, one with his right hand, and one with his left.

**30.** And Samson said, "Let my soul die with the Philistines!" And he bowed himself with strength; and the house fell upon the lords and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life.

**31.** Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him; and they went up, and buried him between Zorah and between Eshtaol, in the tomb of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.

**2.** And he said unto his mother, "The eleven hundred [pieces] of silver that were taken from thee, and for which thou didst utter a curse, and spakest in mine ears; behold, the silver is with me; I took it." And his mother said, "Blessed be my son of the Lord!"

**3.** And he restored the eleven hundred [pieces] of silver to his mother. And his mother said, "I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the Lord from my hand, by myself, to make a graven image and a molten image. And now I will return them unto thee, (yea, and I will restore it unto thee)."

**4.** And he restored the silver unto his mother. And his mother took two hundred [pieces] of the silver,
