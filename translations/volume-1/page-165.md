    ἐστι γὰρ ἀφαίρεμα τοῦτο, καὶ ἀφαίρεμα ἔσται παρὰ τῶν υἱῶν
    Ἰσραὴλ ἀπὸ τῶν θυμάτων τῶν σωτηρίων τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ ἀ-
    29 φαίρεμα Κυρίῳ. Καὶ ἡ στολὴ τοῦ ἁγίου, ἣ ἐστιν ᾿Ααρών, ἔσται
    τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ μετ᾿ αὐτόν, χρισθῆναι αὐτοὺς ἐν αὐτοῖς, καὶ τε-
    30 λειῶσαι τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν· ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας ἐνδύσεται αὐτὰ ὁ ἱερεὺς
    ὁ ἀντ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἐκ τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ, ὃς εἰσελεύσεται εἰς τὴν σκηνὴν
    31 τοῦ μαρτυρίου, λειτουργεῖν ἐν τοῖς ἁγίοις. Καὶ τὸν κριὸν τῆς τε-
    32 λειώσεως λήψῃ, καὶ ἐψήσεις τὰ κρέα ἐν τόπῳ ἁγίῳ· καὶ ἔδονται
    ᾿Ααρὼν καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ τὰ κρέα τοῦ κριοῦ, καὶ τοὺς ἄρτους
    33 τοὺς ἐν τῷ κανῷ παρὰ τὴν θύραν τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου· ἔδον-
    ται αὐτὰ ἐν οἷς ἡγιάσθησαν ἐν αὐτοῖς, τελειῶσαι τὰς χεῖρας αὐ-
    τῶν, καὶ ἁγιάσαι αὐτούς· καὶ ἀλλογενὴς οὐκ ἔδεται ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν,
    34 ἔστι γὰρ ἅγια. ᾿Εὰν δὲ καταλειφθῇ ἀπὸ τῶν κρεῶν τῆς θυσίας
    τῆς τελειώσεως καὶ τῶν ἄρτων ἕως πρωΐ, καὶ κατακαύσεις τὰ
    35 λοιπὰ πυρί· οὐ βρωθήσεται, ἁγίασμα γάρ ἐστι. Καὶ ποιήσεις ᾿Αα-
    ρὼν καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ οὕτω κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἐνετείλαμήν σοι·
    36 ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας τελειώσεις τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν. Καὶ τὸ μοσχάριον τὸ
    τῆς ἁμαρτίας ποιήσεις τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τοῦ καθαρισμοῦ, καὶ καθαριεῖς
    τὸ θυσιαστήριον ἐν τῷ ἁγιάζειν σε ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ, καὶ χρίσεις αὐτό,
    37 ὥστε ἁγιάσαι αὐτό· ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας καθαριεῖς τὸ θυσιαστήριον, καὶ
    ἁγιάσεις αὐτό, καὶ ἔσται τὸ θυσιαστήριον ἅγιον τοῦ ἁγίου· πᾶς δὲ
    ἀπτόμενος τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου, ἁγιασθήσεται. Καὶ ταῦτα ἔστιν, ὅσα
    38 ποιήσεις ἐπὶ τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου ἀμνοὺς ἐνιαυσίους ἀμώμους δύο τὴν
    ἡμέραν (ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον) ἐνδελεχῶς, καρπω-
    39 μα Κυρίῳ· τὸν ἀμνὸν τὸν ἕνα ποιήσεις τὸ πρωΐ, καὶ τὸν
    40 ἀμνὸν τὸν δεύτερον ποιήσεις τὸ δειλινόν· καὶ δέκατον σεμιδάλεως
    πεφυραμένης ἐν ἐλαίῳ κεκομμένῳ τοῦ τετάρτου τοῦ Εἵν, καὶ σπον-
    41 δὴν τὸ τέταρτον τοῦ Εἵν οἴνου τῷ ἀμνῷ τῷ ἑνί· καὶ τὸν ἀμνὸν
    τὸν δεύτερον ποιήσεις τὸ δειλινόν, κατὰ τὴν θυσίαν τὴν πρωϊνὴν
    καὶ κατὰ τὴν σπονδὴν αὐτοῦ· ποιήσεις εἰς ὀσμὴν εὐωδίας κάρπω-
    42 μα Κυρίῳ, θυσίαν ἐνδελεχισμοῦ εἰς τὰς γενεὰς ὑμῶν, ἐπὶ τὰς θύ-
    ρας τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου ἔναντι Κυρίου, ἐν οἷς γνωσθήσο-
    43 μαί σοι ἐκεῖθεν, ὥστε λαλῆσαί σοι. Καὶ τάξομαι ἐκεῖ τοῖς υἱοῖς
    44 Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἁγιασθήσομαι ἐν δόξῃ μου· καὶ ἁγιάσω τὴν σκηνὴν
    τοῦ μαρτυρίου καὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον, καὶ ᾿Ααρὼν καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς
    45 αὐτοῦ ἁγιάσω, ἱερατεύειν μοι· καὶ ἐπικληθήσομαι ἐν τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσ-

    **Exodus 29**

    28 For it is a heave offering, this, and a heave offering shall it be from the sons of Israel, from the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the sons of Israel, a heave offering unto the Lord.
    29 And the holy garment, which is Aaron's, shall be unto his sons after him, that they may be anointed therein, and that their hands may be consecrated.
    30 Seven days shall the priest among his sons, who shall be in his stead, put them on, [even he] who shall enter into the tabernacle of testimony, to minister in the holy [place].
    31 And the ram of consecration shalt thou take, and thou shalt boil the flesh thereof in a holy place.
    32 And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the loaves that are in the basket, at the door of the tabernacle of testimony.
    33 They shall eat these things, in which they were consecrated, [and] in them, to consecrate their hands, and to make them holy; and no stranger shall eat thereof, for they are holy.
    34 But if aught remaineth of the flesh of the sacrifice of consecration, or of the loaves, until the morning, then shalt thou burn the remainder with fire.
    35 It shall not be eaten, for it is a holy thing. And thou shalt do thus unto Aaron and to his sons, according to all things which I have commanded thee: seven days shalt thou consecrate their hands.
    36 And the calf for a sin offering shalt thou offer on the day of purification, and thou shalt purify the altar when thou dost sanctify [it] upon it, and thou shalt anoint it,
    37 so that it may be sanctified. Seven days shalt thou purify the altar, and thou shalt sanctify it; and the altar shall be most holy; and whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be sanctified.
    38 Now these are the things which thou shalt offer upon the altar: two lambs of a year old, without blemish, each day (seven days upon the altar), continually, a gift unto the Lord.
    39 The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the
    40 second lamb shalt thou offer in the evening; and a tenth [part] of fine flour mingled with beaten oil, the fourth [part] of a hin, and a libation, the fourth [part] of a hin of wine, for the one lamb.
    41 And the second lamb shalt thou offer in the evening, according to the morning sacrifice and according to its libation; thou shalt offer [it] for a sweet savour, a gift unto the Lord,
    42 a continual sacrifice for your generations, at the doors of the tabernacle of testimony before the Lord, where I will be known unto thee from thence, so that I may speak unto thee.
    43 And I will set [My presence] there among the sons of Israel, and I will be sanctified in My glory.
    44 And I will sanctify the tabernacle of testimony and the altar, and Aaron and his sons will I sanctify, to minister unto Me in the priestly office.
    45 And I will be invoked among the sons of Is-
