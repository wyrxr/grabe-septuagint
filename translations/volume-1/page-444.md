Βάαλ καὶ ταῖς Ἀστάρταις. Καὶ ὠργίσθη θυμῷ Κύριος τῷ Ἰσραὴλ, 14 καὶ παρέδωκεν αὐτοὺς ἐν χειρὶ προνομευόντων, καὶ ἐπρονόμευσαν αὐτούς· καὶ ἀπέδοτο αὐτοὺς ἐν χειρὶ τῶν ἐχθρῶν αὐτῶν κυκλόθεν, καὶ οὐκ ἠδυνάσθησαν ἔτι ἀντιστῆναι κατὰ πρόσωπον ἐχθρῶν αὐτῶν. 15 Ἐν πᾶσιν οἷς ἐπορεύοντο, καὶ χεὶρ Κυρίου ἦν ἐν αὐτοῖς εἰς κακά, καθὼς ἐλάλησε Κύριος, καὶ καθὼς ὤμοσε Κύριος αὐτοῖς· καὶ ἐξέθλιψεν αὐτοὺς σφόδρα. 16 Καὶ ἤγειρε Κύριος κριτάς, καὶ ἔσωσεν αὐτοὺς ἐκ χειρὸς τῶν προνομευόντων αὐτούς. 17 Καί γε τῶν κριτῶν αὐτῶν οὐκ ἐπήκουσαν, ὅτι ἐξεπόρνευσαν ὀπίσω θεῶν ἑτέρων, καὶ προσεκύνησαν αὐτοῖς, καὶ παρώργισαν τὸν Κύριον, καὶ ἐξέκλιναν ταχὺ ἐκ τῆς ὁδοῦ, ἧς ἐπορεύθησαν οἱ πατέρεις αὐτῶν τοῦ εἰσακούειν ἐντολὰς Κυρίου οὐκ ἐποίησαν οὕτως. 18 Καὶ ὅτε ἤγειρεν αὐτοῖς Κύριος κριτάς, καὶ ἦν Κύριος μετὰ τοῦ κριτοῦ, καὶ ἔσωσεν αὐτοὺς (ἐν χειρὶ τῶν κριτῶν αὐτῶν) ἐκ χειρὸς ἐχθρῶν αὐτῶν, πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας τοῦ κριτοῦ· ὅτι παρεκλήθη Κύριος ἀπὸ τοῦ στεναγμοῦ αὐτῶν (κζλ) πρὸ προσώπου τῶν πολιορκούντων αὐτοὺς καὶ κακούντων αὐτούς. 19 Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἀπέθνησκεν ὁ κριτὴς, καὶ ἀπέστρεψαν, καὶ πάλιν διέφθειραν ὑπὲρ τοὺς πατέρας αὐτῶν, πορευθῆναι ὀπίσω θεῶν ἑτέρων, λατρεύειν αὐτοῖς, καὶ προσκυνεῖν αὐτοῖς· οὐκ ἀπέλιψαν τὰ ἐπιτηδεύματα αὐτῶν, καὶ οὐκ ἀπέστησαν ἀπὸ τῆς ὁδοῦ αὐτῶν τῆς σκληρᾶς. 20 Καὶ ὠργίσθη θυμῷ Κύριος ἐν τῷ Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ εἶπεν· ἀνθ᾿ ὧν ὅσα ἐγκατέλειπαν τὸ ἔθνος τοῦτο τὴν διαθήκην μου, ἣν ἐνετειλάμην τοῖς πατράσιν αὐτῶν, καὶ οὐχ ὑπήκουσαν τῆς φωνῆς μου, 21 καὶ ἐγὼ οὐ προσθήσω τοῦ ἐξᾶραι ἄνδρα ἐκ προσώπου αὐτῶν ἀπὸ τῶν ἐθνῶν, ὧν κατέλιπεν Ἰησοῦς καὶ ἀφῆκε, 22 τοῦ πειράσαι ἐν αὐτοῖς τὸν Ἰσραὴλ, εἰ φυλάσσονται αὐτοὶ τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου πορεύεσθαι ἐν αὐτῇ, ὃν τρόπον ἐφυλάξαντο οἱ πατέρες αὐτῶν, ἢ οὔ. 23 Καὶ ἀφῆκε Κύριος τὰ ἔθνη ταῦτα τοῦ μὴ ἐξᾶραι αὐτὰ τὸ τάχος, καὶ οὐ παρέδωκεν αὐτὰ ἐν χειρὶ Ἰησοῦ.

1 ΚΑΙ ταῦτα τὰ ἔθνη, ἃ ἀφῆκεν Ἰησοῦς ὥστε πειράσαι ἐν αὐτοῖς τὸν Ἰσραὴλ, πάντας τοὺς μὴ ἐγνωκότας πάντας τοὺς πολέμους Χαναὰν, 2 πλὴν διὰ τὰς γενεὰς τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ τοῦ διδάξαι

**JUDGES**
**CHAPTER 2. 3. (Page 429)**

**13.** Baal and the Astartes.
And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel,
**14.** And He delivered them into the hand of spoilers,
who spoiled them;
and He sold them into the hand of their enemies round about,
so that they could no more stand before their enemies.
**15.** And whithersoever they went forth,
the hand of the Lord was upon them for evil,
as the Lord had spoken,
and as the Lord had sworn unto them;
and He greatly distressed them.
**16.** Nevertheless, the Lord raised up judges,
who delivered them out of the hand of those who spoiled them.
**17.** And yet they hearkened not unto their judges,
but they played the harlot after other gods,
and bowed down unto them,
and provoked the Lord to anger,
and turned quickly aside out of the way
which their fathers had walked in,
to hearken unto the commandments of the Lord;
but they did not so.
**18.** And when the Lord raised them up judges,
then the Lord was with the judge,
and saved them (even by the hand of their judges)
out of the hand of their enemies,
all the days of the judge;
for the Lord was moved by their groaning [and the like]
before the face of those who oppressed and afflicted them.
**19.** And it came to pass, when the judge died,
that they turned back, and again corrupted themselves
more than their fathers,
by going after other gods,
to serve them and to bow down unto them;
they left not off their practices,
neither ceased they from their stiff-necked way.
**20.** And the Lord's anger was kindled against Israel, and He said,
Forasmuch as this nation hath forsaken My covenant
which I commanded their fathers,
and have not hearkened unto My voice,
**21.** I also will no more drive out before them
any man of the nations,
whom Joshua left and suffered to remain,
**22.** To prove Israel by them,
whether they will keep the way of the Lord
to walk therein,
as their fathers kept [it], or no.
**23.** So the Lord left these nations,
not driving them out swiftly,
neither delivered He them into the hand of Joshua.

**CHAPTER 3. III.**

**1.** Now these are the nations which Joshua left,
to prove Israel by them,
all those who had not known all the wars of Canaan,
**2.** save only through the generations of the children of Israel,
to teach
