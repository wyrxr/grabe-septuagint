    4 γονοῤῥύης, ἀκάθαρτος ἔσται· καὶ πᾶν σκεῦος, ἐφ᾽ ὃ ἂν καθίσῃ ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸ ὁ γονοῤῥύης, ἀκάθαρτον ἔσται.
    5 Καὶ ἄνθρωπος, ὃς ἂν ἅψηται τῆς κοίτης αὐτοῦ, πλυνεῖ τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ, καὶ λούσεται ὕδατι, καὶ ἀκάθαρτος ἔσται ἕως ἑσπέρας·
    6 καὶ ὁ καθήμενος ἐπὶ τοῦ σκεύους, ἐφ᾽ ὃ ἂν καθίσῃ ὁ γονοῤῥύης, πλυνεῖ τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ, καὶ λούσεται ὕδατι, καὶ ἀκάθαρτος ἔσται ἕως ἑσπέρας·
    7 καὶ ὁ ἁπτόμενος χρωτὸς τοῦ γονοῤῥυοῦς, πλυνεῖ τὰ ἱμάτια, καὶ λούσεται ὕδατι, καὶ ἀκάθαρτος ἔσται ἕως ἑσπέρας·
    8 ἐὰν δὲ προσπελίσῃ ὁ γονοῤῥύης ἐπὶ τὸν καθαρόν, πλυνεῖ τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ, καὶ λούσεται ὕδατι, καὶ ἀκάθαρτος ἔσται ἕως ἑσπέρας.
    9 Καὶ (ἐπὶ) πᾶν ἐπίσαγμα ὄνου, ἐφ᾽ ὃ ἂν καθίσῃ ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸ ὁ γονοῤῥύης, ἀκάθαρτον ἔσται ἕως ἑσπέρας.
    10 Καὶ πᾶς ὁ ἁπτόμενος ὅσα ἂν ᾖ ὑποκάτω αὐτοῦ, ἀκάθαρτος ἔσται ἕως ἑσπέρας· καὶ ὁ αἴρων αὐτά, πλυνεῖ τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ, καὶ λούσεται ὕδατι, καὶ ἀκάθαρτος ἔσται ἕως ἑσπέρας·
    11 καὶ ζῶον ἐὰν ἅψηται ὁ γονοῤῥύης, καὶ τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ οὐ νένιπται ὕδατι, πλυνεῖ τὰ ἱμάτια, καὶ λούσεται τὸ σῶμα ὕδατι, καὶ ἀκάθαρτος ἔσται ἕως ἑσπέρας·
    12 καὶ σκεῦος ὀστράκινον οὗ ἐὰν ἅψηται ὁ γονοῤῥύης, συντριβήσεται· καὶ σκεῦος ξύλινον νιφθήσεται ὕδατι, καὶ καθαρὸν ἔσται.
    13 Ἐὰν δὲ καθαρισθῇ ὁ γονοῤῥύης ἐκ τῆς ῥύσεως αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐξαριθμήσεται ἑαυτῷ ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας εἰς τὸν καθαρισμὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ πλυνεῖ τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ, καὶ λούσεται τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ ὕδατι ζῶντι, καὶ καθαρὸς ἔσται.
    14 Καὶ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ὀγδόῃ λήψεται ἑαυτῷ δύο τρυγόνας, ἢ δύο νεοσσοὺς περιστερῶν, καὶ οἴσει αὐτὰ ἔναντι Κυρίου ἐπὶ τὰς θύρας τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου, καὶ δώσει αὐτὰ τῷ ἱερεῖ.
    15 Καὶ ποιήσει αὐτὰ ὁ ἱερεύς, μίαν περὶ ἁμαρτίας, καὶ μίαν εἰς ὁλοκαύτωμα· καὶ ἐξιλάσεται περὶ αὐτοῦ ὁ ἱερεὺς ἔναντι Κυρίου περὶ τῆς ῥύσεως αὐτοῦ.
    16 Καὶ ἄνθρωπος, ὡς ἐὰν ἐξέλθῃ ἐξ αὐτοῦ κοίτη σπέρματος, καὶ λούσεται ὕδατι πᾶν τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀκάθαρτος ἔσται ἕως ἑσπέρας·
    17 καὶ πᾶν ἱμάτιον, καὶ πᾶν δέρμα ἐφ᾽ ὃ ἐὰν ᾖ ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸ κοίτη σπέρματος, καὶ πλυθήσεται ὕδατι, καὶ ἀκάθαρτον ἔσται ἕως ἑσπέρας.
    18 Καὶ γυνὴ ἐὰν κοιμηθῇ ἀνὴρ μετ᾽ αὐτῆς κοίτην σπέρματος, καὶ λούσονται ὕδατι, καὶ ἀκάθαρτοι ἔσονται ἕως ἑσπέρας.
    19 Καὶ γυνὴ ἥτις ἐὰν ᾖ ῥέουσα αἵματι, ἔσται ἡ ῥύσις αὐτῆς ἐν τῷ σώματι αὐτῆς, ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας ἔστω ἐν τῇ ἀφέδρῳ αὐτῆς· πᾶς ὁ ἁπτόμενος αὐτῆς, ἀκάθαρτος ἔσται ἕως ἑσπέρας·
