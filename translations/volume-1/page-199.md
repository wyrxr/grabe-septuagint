συναγωγὴν ἐκκλησίασον ἐπὶ τὴν θύραν τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου.
4 Καὶ ἐποίησε Μωυσῆς, ὃν τρόπον αὐτῷ συνέταξε Κύριος· καὶ ἐξεκκλησίασε τὴν συναγωγὴν ἐπὶ τὴν θύραν τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου.
5 Καὶ εἶπε Μωυσῆς τῇ συναγωγῇ· τοῦτό ἐστι τὸ ῥῆμα, (τοῦτό ἐστιν)
6 ὃ ἐνετείλατο Κύριος ποιῆσαι. Καὶ προσήνεγκε Μωυσῆς τὸν Ἀαρὼν καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔλουσεν αὐτοὺς ὕδατι, καὶ ἐνέδυσεν
7 αὐτὸν τὸν χιτῶνα, καὶ ἔζωσεν αὐτὸν τὴν ζώνην, καὶ ἐνέδυσεν αὐτὸν ἐπενδύτην, καὶ ἐπέθηκεν αὐτῷ τὴν ἐπωμίδα· καὶ συνέζωσεν αὐτὸν κατὰ τὴν ποίησιν τῆς ἐπωμίδος, καὶ συνέσφιγξεν αὐτόν·
8 ἐν αὐτῇ· καὶ ἐπέθηκεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν τὸ λογεῖον, καὶ ἐπέθηκεν ἐπὶ τὸ
9 λογεῖον τὴν δήλωσιν καὶ τὴν ἀλήθειαν· καὶ ἐπέθηκε τὴν μίτραν· ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπέθηκεν ἐπὶ τὴν μίτραν κατὰ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ τὸ πέταλον τὸ χρυσοῦν τὸ καθηγιασμένον ἅγιον, ὃν
10 τρόπον συνέταξε Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ. Καὶ ἔλαβε Μωυσῆς ἀπὸ τοῦ ἐλαίου τῆς χρίσεως, καὶ ἔχρισε τὴν σκηνὴν καὶ πάντα τὰ ἐν
11 αὐτῇ, καὶ ἡγίασεν αὐτήν· καὶ ἔρανεν ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον ἑπτάκις, καὶ ἔχρισε τὸ θυσιαστήριον, καὶ ἡγίασεν αὐτό, καὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὸν λουτῆρα, καὶ τὴν βάσιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἡγίασεν αὐτά· (καὶ ἔχρισε τὴν σκηνήν, καὶ πάντα τὰ ἐν αὐ-
12 τῇ, καὶ ἡγίασεν αὐτήν). Καὶ ἐπέχεε Μωυσῆς ἀπὸ τοῦ ἐλαίου τῆς χρίσεως ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν Ἀαρὼν, καὶ ἔχρισεν αὐτὸν, καὶ
13 ἡγίασεν αὐτόν. Καὶ προσήγαγε Μωυσῆς τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἀαρὼν, καὶ ἐνέδυσεν αὐτοὺς χιτῶνας, καὶ ἔζωσεν αὐτοὺς ζώνας, καὶ περιέ-

15 τοῦ μόσχου τοῦ τῆς ἁμαρτίας. Καὶ ἔσφαξεν αὐτὸν, καὶ ἔλαβε Μωυσῆς ἀπὸ τοῦ αἵματος, καὶ ἐπέθηκεν ἐπὶ τὰ κέρατα τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου κύκλῳ τῷ δακτύλῳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐκαθάρισε τὸ θυσιαστήριον· καὶ ἐξέχεε τὸ αἷμα ἐπὶ τὴν βάσιν τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου, καὶ

Chapter 8 of Leviticus

Assemble the congregation at the door of the Tent of Witness.

4 And Moses did as the Lord had commanded him; and he assembled the congregation at the door of the Tent of Witness.

5 And Moses said unto the congregation, “This is the word, (this it is)
6 which the Lord hath commanded to be done.” And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.
7 And he clothed him with the tunic, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put upon him the ephod; and he bound him with the binding of the ephod, and fastened it upon him
8 with it. And he put upon him the breastpiece, and placed upon the
9 breastpiece the Declaration and the Truth; and he set the mitre upon his head, and upon the mitre, facing him, he placed the golden plate, the consecrated holy [diadem],
10 as the Lord had commanded Moses. And Moses took of the anointing oil, and anointed the Tent and all things within
11 it, and sanctified it. And he sprinkled of it upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar, and sanctified it, and all its vessels, and the laver, and its base, and sanctified them; (and he anointed the Tent, and all things within
12 it, and sanctified it.) And Moses poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron’s head, and anointed him, and
13 sanctified him. And Moses brought Aaron’s sons, and clothed them with tunics, and girded them with girdles, and bound upon
14 them headbands, as the Lord had commanded Moses. And Moses brought the calf for the sin offering; and Aaron and Aaron’s sons laid their hands upon the head
15 of the calf of the sin offering. And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar; and he poured out the blood at the base of the altar, and
16 sanctified it, to make propitiation for it. And Moses took all the fat that was upon the entrails, and the lobe that was upon the
17 liver, and both the kidneys, and the fat that was upon them, and Moses brought [them] up upon the altar; and the calf, and its flesh, and its hide, and its dung (and) he burned them with fire outside the camp, as the Lord had commanded Moses.
