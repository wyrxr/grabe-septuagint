5 πορευέσθω καὶ ἐπιστραφήτω εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν αὐτοῦ, μή ποτε ἀποθάνῃ
6 ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ, καὶ ἄνθρωπος ἕτερος ἐγκαινιεῖ αὐτήν· καὶ τίς ὁ
    ἄνθρωπος ὅστις ἐφύτευσεν ἀμπελῶνα, καὶ οὐκ ηὐφράνθη ἐξ αὐτοῦ;
    πορευέσθω καὶ ἐπιστραφήτω εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν αὐτοῦ, μὴ ἀποθάνῃ ἐν
7 τῷ πολέμῳ, καὶ ἄνθρωπος ἕτερος εὐφρανθήσεται ἐξ αὐτοῦ· καὶ τίς
    ὁ ἄνθρωπος ὅστις μεμνήστευται γυναῖκα, καὶ οὐκ ἔλαβεν αὐτήν;
    πορευέσθω καὶ ἐπιστραφήτω εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν αὐτοῦ, μή ποτε ἀποθά-
8 νῃ ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ, καὶ ἄνθρωπος ἕτερος λήψεται αὐτήν. Καὶ προσ-
    θήσουσιν οἱ γραμματεῖς λαλῆσαι πρὸς τὸν λαόν, καὶ ἐροῦσι· τίς
    ἄνθρωπος ὁ φοβούμενος καὶ δειλὸς τῇ καρδίᾳ; πορευέσθω καὶ ἀπο-
    στραφήτω εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν αὐτοῦ, ἵνα μὴ δειλιάσῃ τὴν καρδίαν (αὐ-
9 τοῦ καὶ) τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ, ὥσπερ ἡ καρδία αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἔσται
    ὅταν παύσωνται οἱ γραμματεῖς λαλοῦντες πρὸς τὸν λαόν, καὶ
10 καταστήσουσιν ἄρχοντας τῆς στρατιᾶς προηγουμένους τοῦ λαοῦ. Ἐὰν
    δὲ προσέλθῃς πρὸς πόλιν ἐκπολεμῆσαι αὐτήν, καὶ ἐκκαλέσῃ αὐ-
11 τοὺς μετ’ εἰρήνης· καὶ ἔσται ἐὰν μὲν εἰρηνικὰ ἀποκριθῶσί σοι, καὶ
    ἀνοίξωσί σοι, ἔσται πᾶς ὁ λαός, οἱ εὑρεθέντες ἐν τῇ πόλει ἔσον-
12 ταί σοι φορολόγητοι καὶ ὑπακούσωσί σου. Ἐὰν δὲ μὴ ὑπακούσωσί σοι,
13 καὶ ποιήσωσι πρὸς σὲ πόλεμον, περικαθιεῖς αὐτήν· καὶ παραδώ-
    σει αὐτὴν Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου εἰς τὰς χεῖράς σου, καὶ πατάξεις πᾶν
14 ἀρσενικὸν αὐτῆς ἐν φόνῳ μαχαίρας· πλὴν τῶν γυναικῶν, καὶ τῆς
    ἀποσκευῆς, καὶ πάντα τὰ κτήνη, καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἂν ὑπάρχῃ ἐν τῇ
    πόλει, καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν ἀπαρτίαν προνομεύσεις σεαυτῷ, καὶ φάγῃ
15 πᾶσαν τὴν προνομὴν τῶν ἐχθρῶν σου, ὧν Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου δί-
    δωσί σοι. Οὕτως ποιήσεις πάσας τὰς πόλεις τὰς μακρὰν οὔσας
16 ἀπὸ σοῦ σφόδρα, αἱ οὐχὶ ἀπὸ τῶν πόλεων τῶν ἐθνῶν τούτων. Ἰδοὺ
    δὲ ἀπὸ τῶν πόλεων τῶν ἐθνῶν τούτων, ὧν Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου
17 δίδωσί σοι κληρονομεῖν τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν, οὐ ζωγρήσετε ἀπ’ αὐτῶν
    πᾶν ἔμπνεον· ἀλλὰ ἀναθέματι ἀναθεματιεῖτε αὐτούς, τὸν Χετταῖ-
18 ον, καὶ τὸν Ἀμοῤῥαῖον, καὶ τὸν Χαναναῖον, καὶ Φερεζαῖον, καὶ Εὐ-
    αῖον, καὶ Ἰεβουσαῖον, καὶ Γεργεσαῖον, ὃν τρόπον ἐνετείλατό σοι
    Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου· ἵνα μὴ διδάξωσιν ὑμᾶς ποιεῖν πάντα τὰ βδε-
19 λύγματα αὐτῶν, ἴσα ἐποίησαν τοῖς θεοῖς αὐτῶν, καὶ ἁμαρτήσε-
    σθε ἐναντίον Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ὑμῶν. Ἐὰν δὲ περικαθίσῃς περὶ πό-
    λιν ἡμέρας πλείονας, ἐκπολεμῆσαι αὐτὴν εἰς κατάληψιν αὐτῆς, οὐκ
    ἐξολοθρεύσεις τὰ δένδρα αὐτῆς, ἐπιβαλεῖν ἐπ’ αὐτὰ σίδηρον, ἀλλὰ

**DEUTERONOMY, CHAPTER 20.**

5 Let him go and return unto his house, lest haply he die
in the battle, and another man dedicate it.
6 And who is the man that hath planted a vineyard,
and hath not yet enjoyed the fruit thereof?
Let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle,
7 and another man shall enjoy the fruit thereof.
And who is the man that hath betrothed a woman,
and hath not yet taken her [to wife]?
Let him go and return unto his house,
lest haply he die in the battle,
8 and another man shall take her.
And the officers shall further speak unto the people, and they shall say:
“Who is the man that is fearful and fainthearted?
Let him go and turn back unto his house,
lest he cause his heart to faint, (even his own heart and)
9 the heart of his brother, even as his own heart [doth faint].”
And it shall be, when the officers have ceased speaking unto the people,
10 then shall they appoint commanders of the army, [to be] foremost among the people.

11 When thou drawest nigh unto a city to make war against it,
then shalt thou call them unto peace.
And it shall be, if indeed they shall answer thee peacefully,
and shall open [their gates] unto thee,
then shall all the people that are found within the city
12 be tributary unto thee, and subject unto thee.
But if they will not hearken unto thee,
13 and shall make war against thee, then shalt thou besiege it.
And the LORD thy God shall deliver it into thine hands,
and thou shalt smite every male thereof
14 with the slaughter of the sword;
save the women, and the baggage, and all the cattle,
and all that shall be within the city,
and all the spoil thou shalt plunder for thyself,
and thou shalt eat
15 all the spoil of thine enemies,
which the LORD thy God doth give unto thee.
Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities that are very far
16 from thee, which are not of the cities of these nations.
But behold, from the cities of these nations,
which the LORD thy God
17 giveth thee to inherit their land,
ye shall not save alive from them anything that breatheth;
but with an anathema ye shall utterly destroy them:
the Hittite, and the Amorite,
18 and the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite,
and the Jebusite, and the Girgashite;
even as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee;
lest they teach you to do all their abominations,
19 which they have wrought unto their gods,
and ye sin against the LORD your God.
If then thou shalt besiege a city for many days,
to make war against it for its capture,
thou shalt not destroy its trees, to cast iron upon them, but
