διάδος αὐτὴν ἐν κλήρῳ τῷ Ἰσραήλ, ὃν τρόπον ἐνετείλαμην σοι. 7 Καὶ νῦν μέρισον τὴν γῆν ταύτην ἐν κληρονομίᾳ ταῖς ἐννέα φυλαῖς, καὶ τῷ ἡμίσει τῆς φυλῆς Μανασσῆ ἀπὸ τοῦ Ἰορδάνου ἕως τῆς θαλάσσης τῆς μεγάλης κατὰ δυσμὰς ἡλίου 8 δώσεις αὐτήν· ἡ θάλασσα ἡ μεγάλη ὁριεῖ. Ταῖς δὲ δύο φυλαῖς, καὶ τῷ ἡμίσει φυλῆς Μανασσῆ, τοῖς μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, τῷ Ῥουβὴν καὶ τῷ Γάδ, ἐλάβοσαν κληρονομίαν αὐτῶν, ἣν ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς Μωυσῆς ἐν τῷ πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου κατ᾿ ἀνατολὰς ἡλίου δέδωκεν αὐτοῖς Μωυσῆς ὁ παῖς Κυρίου· 9 ἀπὸ Ἀροήρ, ἥ ἐστιν ἐπὶ τοῦ χείλους χειμάῤῥου Ἀρνῶν, καὶ τὴν πόλιν τὴν ἐν μέσῳ τῆς φάραγγος, 10 καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν Μισὼρ ἀπὸ Μαιδαβὰ ἕως Δειβών· καὶ πάσας τὰς πόλεις Σηὼν βασιλέως τῶν Ἀμοῤῥαίων, ὃς ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ἑσεβὼν ἕως τῶν ὁρίων υἱῶν Ἀμμὼν 11 καὶ τὴν Γαλααδίτιν, καὶ τὰ ὅρια Γεσουρί, καὶ τοὺς Μαχαθί, πᾶν ὄρος Ἀερμὼν, καὶ πᾶσαν 12 τὴν Βασανίτιν ἕως Σελχά· (καὶ) πᾶσαν τὴν βασιλείαν Ὢγ ἐν τῇ Βασάν, ὃς ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ἀσταρὼθ καὶ ἐν Ἐδραείμ· οὗτος κατελείφθη ἀπὸ τοῦ λείμματος τῶν Γιγάντων, καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτὸν 13 Μωυσῆς, καὶ ἐξωλόθρευσεν αὐτόν. Καὶ οὐκ ἐξωλόθρευσαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ τὸν Γεσουρί, καὶ τὸν Μαχαθί, καὶ τὸν Χαναναῖον· καὶ κατῴκει βασιλεὺς Γεσουρὶ καὶ Μαχαθί, ἐν τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης. 14 Πλὴν τῇ φυλῇ τῇ Λευὶ οὐκ ἐδόθη κληρονομία· Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραὴλ οὗτος αὐτῶν κληρονομία, καθὰ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς Κύριος. Καὶ οὗτος ὁ καταμερισμὸς ὃν κατεμέρισε Μωυσῆς τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραὴλ ἐν Ἀραβὼθ Μωάβ ἐν τῷ πέραν 15 τοῦ Ἰορδάνου κατὰ Ἱεριχώ. Καὶ ἔδωκε Μωυσῆς τῇ φυλῇ υἱῶν Ῥουβὴν κατὰ δήμους αὐτῶν. 16 Καὶ ἐγενήθη αὐτοῖς τὰ ὅρια ἀπὸ Ἀροήρ, ἥ ἐστι κατὰ πρόσωπον φάραγγος Ἀρνῶν, καὶ ἡ πόλις ἡ ἐν τῇ φάραγγι Ἀρνῶν, καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν Μισὼρ κατὰ Μαιδαβᾶ, 17 ἕως Ἐσεβὼν καὶ πάσας τὰς πόλεις αὐτῶν τὰς οὔσας ἐν τῇ Μισὼρ, καὶ Δαιβὼρ καὶ Βαμὼθ Βάαλ, καὶ οἴκους Βεελμεὼν, 18 καὶ Ἰασσὰ, καὶ Κεδημὼθ, καὶ Μηφαὰθ, καὶ Καριαθαὶμ, καὶ Σεβαμὰ, 19 καὶ Σὰρθ καὶ Σιὼρ ἐν τῷ ὄρει Ἐμὰχ, καὶ Βεθογοὼρ, καὶ Ἀσηδὼθ Φασγὰ, καὶ Βηθασιμοὺθ, 20 καὶ πάσας τὰς πόλεις τοῦ Μισὼρ, καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ Σηὼν βασιλέως τῶν Ἀμοῤῥαίων, ὃς ἐβασίλευσεν ἐν Ἑσεβὼν, ὃν ἐπάταξε Μωυσῆς αὐτὸν, καὶ τοὺς 21 ἡγουμένους Μαδιὰν, καὶ τὸν Ἐυὶ, καὶ τὸν Ῥοκὸμ, καὶ τὸν Σοὺρ

**Joshua 13** (continued)

<sup>6</sup> […But] distribute it by lot unto Israel, even as I commanded thee.
<sup>7</sup> Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes, and unto the half-tribe of Manasseh,
<sup>8</sup> from the Jordan even unto the Great Sea toward the going down of the sun, thou shalt give it: the Great Sea shall be its boundary. But unto the two tribes, and unto the half-tribe of Manasseh, even those with him, [to wit,] Reuben and Gad, they received their inheritance, which Moses gave them beyond the Jordan eastward. Moses, the servant of the LORD, gave it unto them:
<sup>9</sup> From Aroer, which is upon the bank of the brook Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the ravine,
<sup>10</sup> and all Misor from Medeba even unto Dibon; and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, even unto the borders of the children of Ammon;
<sup>11</sup> And the land of Gilead, and the borders of the Geshurites, and the Maachathites, all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto Salcah;
<sup>12</sup> And all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei. This one remained of the remnant of the Giants; and Moses smote him, and utterly destroyed him.
<sup>13</sup> And the children of Israel did not utterly destroy the Geshurite, nor the Maachathite, nor the Canaanite; but the king of Geshur and Maachath dwelt among the children of Israel until this day.
<sup>14</sup> Save that unto the tribe of Levi there was no inheritance given; for the LORD God of Israel, He is their inheritance, as the LORD spake unto them. And this is the division which Moses divided unto the children of Israel in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan by Jericho.
<sup>15</sup> And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their families.
<sup>16</sup> And their borders were from Aroer, which is before the face of the ravine of Arnon, and the city that is in the ravine of Arnon, and all Misor toward Medeba,
<sup>17</sup> even unto Heshbon, and all their cities that are in Misor, and Dibon, and Bamoth-Baal, and the houses of Beth-baal-meon,
<sup>18</sup> and Jahaz, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath, and Kiriathaim, and Sibmah,
<sup>19</sup> and Zarath, and Sihor in Mount Emak, and Beth-hogor, and Ashdoth-Pisgah, and Beth-jesimoth,
<sup>20</sup> and all the cities of Misor, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote, and the
<sup>21</sup> rulers of Midian, even Evi, and Rekem, and Zur,
