χρίσεως, καὶ χρίσεις τὴν σκηνὴν καὶ πάντα τὰ ἐν αὐτῇ, καὶ ἀγιάσεις
αὐτὴν καὶ πάντα τὰ σκεύη αὐτῆς, καὶ ἔσται ἁγία·
10 καὶ χρίσεις τὸ θυσιαστήριον τῶν καρπωμάτων, καὶ πάντα αὐτοῦ τὰ
σκεύη, καὶ ἁγιάσεις τὸ θυσιαστήριον, καὶ ἔσται τὸ θυσιαστήριον
11 ἅγιον τῶν ἁγίων· καὶ χρίσεις τὸν λουτῆρα καὶ τὴν βάσιν αὐτοῦ,
12 καὶ ἁγιάσεις αὐτόν. Καὶ προσάξεις τὸν Ἀαρὼν καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς
αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὰς θύρας τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου, καὶ λούσεις αὐτοὺς
13 ὕδατι· καὶ ἐνδύσεις τὸν Ἀαρὼν τὰς στολὰς τὰς ἁγίας, καὶ
14 χρίσεις αὐτόν, καὶ ἁγιάσεις αὐτόν, καὶ ἱερατεύσει μοι· καὶ τοὺς
15 υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ προσάξεις, καὶ ἐνδύσεις αὐτοὺς χιτῶνας· καὶ ἀλείψεις
αὐτούς, ὃν τρόπον ἤλειψας τὸν πατέρα αὐτῶν, καὶ ἱερατεύσουσι μοι·
καὶ ἔσται, ὥστε εἶναι αὐτοῖς χρίσμα αὐτῶν ἱερατείας
16 εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, εἰς τὰς γενεὰς αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐποίησε Μωυσῆς κατὰ
17 πάντα, ὅσα συνέταξεν αὐτῷ Κύριος, οὕτως ἐποίησε. Καὶ ἐγένετο
ἐν τῷ μηνὶ τῷ πρώτῳ, δευτέρῳ ἔτει ἐκπορευομένων αὐτῶν ἐξ
18 Αἰγύπτου, νουμηνίᾳ, ἐστάθη ἡ σκηνή· καὶ ἔστησε Μωυσῆς τὴν
σκηνήν, καὶ ἔθηκε τὰς βάσεις αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐπέθηκε τὰς κεφαλίδας
αὐτῆς, καὶ διενέβαλε τοὺς μοχλοὺς αὐτῆς, καὶ ἔστησε τοὺς στύλους
19 αὐτῆς· καὶ ἐξέτεινε τὰς αὐλαίας ἐπὶ τὴν σκηνήν, καὶ ἐπέθηκε τὸ
κατακάλυμμα τῆς σκηνῆς ἐπ᾽ αὐτὴν ἄνωθεν, καθὰ συνέταξε Κύριος τῷ
20 Μωυσῇ. Καὶ λαβὼν τὰ μαρτύρια ἐνέβαλεν εἰς τὴν κιβωτόν· καὶ
ἐπέθηκε τοὺς διωστήρας ὑπὸ τὴν κιβωτόν, καὶ
21 ἔθηκε τὸ ἱλαστήριον ἐπὶ τῆς κιβωτοῦ ἐπάνωθεν· καὶ εἰσήνεγκε τὴν
κιβωτὸν εἰς τὴν σκηνήν, καὶ ἐπέθηκε τὸ κατακάλυμμα τοῦ καταπετάσματος,
καὶ ἐσκέπασε τὴν κιβωτὸν τοῦ μαρτυρίου, ὃν τρόπον
22 συνέταξε Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ. Καὶ ἔθηκε τὴν τράπεζαν εἰς τὴν
σκηνὴν τοῦ μαρτυρίου ἐπὶ τὸ κλίτος τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου
23 πρὸς βορρᾶν, ἔξωθεν τοῦ καταπετάσματος τῆς σκηνῆς· καὶ προσέθηκεν
ἐπ᾽ αὐτῆς ἄρτους τῆς προθέσεως ἐναντίον Κυρίου, ὃν τρόπον
24 συνέταξε Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ. Καὶ ἔθηκε τὴν λυχνίαν εἰς τὴν
σκηνὴν τοῦ μαρτυρίου ἀπέναντι τῆς τραπέζης, εἰς τὸ κλίτος τῆς
25 σκηνῆς τὸ πρὸς νότον, καὶ ἐπέθηκε τοὺς λύχνους αὐτῆς ἐναντίον
26 Κυρίου, ὃν τρόπον συνέταξε Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ. Καὶ ἔθηκε τὸ
θυσιαστήριον τὸ χρυσοῦν ἐν τῇ σκηνῇ τοῦ μαρτυρίου ἀπέναντι τοῦ
27 καταπετάσματος, καὶ ἐθυμίασεν ἐπ᾽ αὐτοῦ θυμίαμα τῆς συνθέσεως,
28 ὃν τρόπον συνέταξε Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ. Καὶ ἔθηκε τὸ ἐπίπαστρον

CHAPTER 40

of anointing, and thou shalt anoint the Tabernacle and all things therein,
and thou shalt sanctify it and all its vessels, and it shall be holy.
**10** And thou shalt anoint the altar of burnt offerings and all its vessels,
and thou shalt sanctify the altar, and the altar shall be the Holy of Holies.
**11** And thou shalt anoint the laver and its base, and thou shalt sanctify it.
**12** And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the doors of the Tabernacle
of the Testimony, and thou shalt wash them with water;
**13** and thou shalt array Aaron in the holy garments, and thou shalt anoint him,
and thou shalt sanctify him, and he shall minister as priest unto Me.
**14** And thou shalt bring his sons, and thou shalt array them in tunics;
**15** and thou shalt anoint them, in the manner which thou didst anoint their father,
and they shall minister as priests unto Me; and it shall be, that their anointing
for the priesthood shall be unto them forever, throughout their generations.

**16** And Moses did according to all things whatsoever the Lord commanded him;
thus did he.
**17** And it came to pass in the first month, in the second year,
as they went forth from Egypt, on the new moon, was the Tabernacle erected.
**18** And Moses set up the Tabernacle, and he set its bases, and he placed its capitals,
and he inserted its bars, and he set up its pillars.
**19** And he stretched the curtains over the Tabernacle,
and he placed the covering of the Tabernacle above it,
as the Lord had commanded Moses.
**20** And taking the testimonies, he put them into the Ark;
and he set the carrying poles beneath the Ark,
**21** and he laid the Mercy Seat upon the Ark from above;
and he brought the Ark into the Tabernacle,
and he set up the covering, [even] the veil,
and he covered the Ark of the Testimony,
as the Lord had commanded Moses.
**22** And he placed the table in the Tabernacle of the Testimony,
upon the northern side of the Tabernacle of the Testimony,
without the veil of the Tabernacle;
**23** and he laid upon it the Showbread before the Lord,
as the Lord had commanded Moses.
**24** And he placed the lampstand in the Tabernacle of the Testimony
over against the table, on the southern side of the Tabernacle,
**25** and he set up its lamps before the Lord,
as the Lord had commanded Moses.
**26** And he placed the golden altar in the Tabernacle of the Testimony
over against the veil,
**27** and he offered thereon incense of the compound [perfumes],
as the Lord had commanded Moses.
**28** And he placed the screen [for the door] of the Tabernacle.
