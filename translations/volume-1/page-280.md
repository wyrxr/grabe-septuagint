συνάγαγε τὴν συναγωγὴν σου, καὶ γίνεσθε ἕτοιμοι ἔναντι Κυρίου σὺ
καὶ αὐτοὶ καὶ Ἀαρὼν αὔριον· καὶ λάβετε ἕκαστος τὸ πυρεῖον αὑ- 17
τοῦ, καὶ ἐπιθήσετε ἐπ᾿ αὐτὰ θυμίαμα, καὶ προσάξετε ἔναντι Κυ-
ρίου ἕκαστος τὸ πυρεῖον αὑτοῦ, πεντήκοντα καὶ διακόσια πυρεῖα,
καὶ σὺ καὶ Ἀαρὼν ἕκαστος τὸ πυρεῖον αὑτοῦ. Καὶ ἔλαβον ἕκα- 18
στος τὸ πυρεῖον αὑτοῦ, καὶ ἐπέθηκαν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὰ πῦρ, καὶ ἐπέβαλον
ἐπ᾿ αὐτὰ θυμίαμα, καὶ ἔστησαν παρὰ τὰς θύρας τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ
μαρτυρίου Μωυσῆς καὶ Ἀαρὼν καὶ ἐπισυνέστησεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς Κορέ 19
πᾶσαν αὑτοῦ τὴν συναγωγὴν παρὰ τὰς θύρας τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρ-
τυρίου· καὶ ὤφθη ἡ δόξα Κυρίου πάσῃ τῇ συναγωγῇ. Καὶ ἐλάλησε 20
Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν καὶ Ἀαρών, λέγων ἀποσχίσθητε ἐκ μέσου 21
τῆς συναγωγῆς ταύτης, καὶ ἐξαναλώσω αὐτοὺς εἰσάπαξ. Καὶ ἔπεσαν 22
ἐπὶ πρόσωπον αὑτῶν, καὶ εἶπαν· Θεὸς Θεὸς τῶν πνευμάτων καὶ
πάσης σαρκός, εἰ ἄνθρωπος εἷς ἥμαρτεν, ἐπὶ πᾶσαν τὴν συναγωγὴν
ἡ ὀργὴ Κυρίου; Καὶ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, λέγων 23
λάλησον τῇ συναγωγῇ, λέγων ἀναχωρήσατε κύκλῳ ἀπὸ τῆς συναγω- 24
γῆς Κορέ καὶ Δαθὰν καὶ Ἀβειρών. Καὶ ἀνέστη Μωυσῆς, καὶ ἐπο- 25
ρεύθη πρὸς Δαθὰν καὶ Ἀβειρὼν καὶ συνεπορεύθησαν μετ᾿ αὑτοῦ
πάντες οἱ πρεσβύτεροι Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἐλάλησε πρὸς τὴν συναγωγήν, 26
λέγων· ἀποσχίσθητε δὴ ἀπὸ τῶν σκηνῶν τῶν ἀνθρώπων τῶν σκλη-
ρῶν τούτων, καὶ μὴ ἅπτεσθε ἀπὸ πάντων, ὅσα ἐστὶν αὑτοῖς, μή-
ποτε συναπόλησθε ἐν πάσῃ τῇ ἁμαρτίᾳ αὑτῶν. Καὶ ἀπέστησαν ἀπὸ 27
τῆς σκηνῆς Κορέ καὶ Δαθὰν καὶ Ἀβειρὼν κύκλῳ· καὶ Δαθὰν καὶ
Ἀβειρὼν ἐξῆλθον, καὶ εἰστήκεισαν παρὰ τὰς θύρας τῶν σκηνωμάτων
αὑτῶν, καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες αὑτῶν, καὶ τὰ τέκνα αὑτῶν, καὶ ἡ ἀπο-
σκευὴ αὑτῶν. Καὶ εἶπε Μωυσῆς· ἐν τούτῳ γνώσεσθε ὅτι Κύριος 28
ἀπέστειλέ με ποιῆσαι πάντα τὰ ἔργα ταῦτα, ὅτι οὐκ ἀπ᾿ ἐμαυ-
τοῦ· εἰ κατὰ θάνατον πάντων ἀνθρώπων ἀποθανοῦνται αὑτοί, εἰ καὶ 29
κατ᾿ ἐπίσκεψιν πάντων ἀνθρώπων ἐπισκοπὴ ἔσται αὑτῶν, οὐχὶ Κύ-
ριος ἀπέστειλέ με· ἀλλ᾿ εἰ ἐν φάσματι δείξει Κύριος, καὶ ἀνοίξασα 30
ἡ γῆ τὸ στόμα αὑτῆς, καταπίεται αὑτούς, καὶ τοὺς οἴκους αὑτῶν,
καὶ τὰς σκηνὰς αὑτῶν, καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐστὶν αὑτοῖς, καὶ καταβή-
σονται ζῶντες εἰς ἅδου, καὶ γνώσεσθε, ὅτι παρώξυναν οἱ ἄνθρωποι
οὗτοι τὸν Κύριον. Ὡς δὲ ἐπαύσατο λαλῶν πάντας τοὺς λόγους τού- 31
τους, ἐῤῥάγη ἡ γῆ ὑποκάτω (τῶν ποδῶν) αὑτῶν, καὶ ἠνοίχθη ἡ 32
γῆ, καὶ κατέπιεν αὑτούς, καὶ τοὺς οἴκους αὑτῶν, καὶ πάντας τοὺς

### NUMBERS, CHAPTER 16

**16** Gather thou thy congregation, and be ye ready before the Lord, thou, and they, and Aaron, tomorrow.
**17** And let each man take his censer, and ye shall put incense upon them, and ye shall bring before the Lord, each man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers, both thou and Aaron, each man his censer.
**18** And each man took his censer, and they put fire upon them, and they cast incense upon them; and Moses and Aaron stood by the doors of the Tabernacle of Testimony.
**19** And Korah gathered all his congregation against them by the doors of the Tabernacle of Testimony; and the glory of the Lord appeared unto all the congregation.

**20** And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
**21** Separate yourselves from the midst of this congregation, and I shall consume them in a moment.
**22** And they fell upon their faces, and they said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, if one man hath sinned, shall Thy wrath be upon all the congregation?

**23** And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
**24** Speak unto the congregation, saying, Depart ye round about from the congregation of Korah, and Dathan, and Abiram.
**25** And Moses rose up, and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and all the elders of Israel went with him.
**26** And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart ye now from the tents of these wicked men, and touch ye nothing of all that is theirs, lest ye be consumed together in all their sin.
**27** And they departed from the tent of Korah, and Dathan, and Abiram, round about. And Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood by the doors of their tents, and their wives, and their children, and all their possessions.

**28** And Moses said, Hereby shall ye know that the Lord hath sent me to do all these works, for [I have not done them] of mine own [accord].
**29** If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited with the visitation of all men, then the Lord hath not sent me.
**30** But if the Lord shall show a [new] thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, with their houses, and their tents, and all things that pertain unto them, and they go down alive into Hades, then shall ye understand that these men have provoked the Lord.
**31** And as he ceased speaking all these words,
**32** the earth clave asunder beneath [the feet of] them, and the earth opened, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men
