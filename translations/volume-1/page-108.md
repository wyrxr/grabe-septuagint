ΚΕΦ. ΜΘ΄. Ν΄. ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ 93
κάλλος. Υἱὸς ηὐξημένος Ἰωσήφ, υἱὸς ηὐξημένος ζηλωτός, υἱὸς μου 22
νεώτατος· πρὸς με ἀνάστρεψον. Εἰς ὃν διαβουλευόμενοι ἐλοιδο- 23
ροῦν, καὶ ἐνεῖχον αὐτῷ κύριοι τοξευμάτων· καὶ συνετρίβη με- 24
τὰ κράτους τὰ τόξα αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐξελύθη τὰ νεῦρα βραχιόνων
χειρῶν αὐτῶν, διὰ χεῖρα δυνάστου Ἰακώβ· ἐκεῖθεν ὁ κατισχύ-
σας σε Ἰσραήλ παρὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ πατρός σου. Καὶ ἐβοήθη- 25
σέ σοι ὁ Θεὸς ὁ ἐμός, καὶ εὐλόγησέ σε εὐλογίᾳν οὐρανοῦ ἄνω-
θεν, καὶ εὐλογίᾳν τῆς γῆς ἐχούσης πάντα, ἕνεκεν εὐλογίας μαστῶν
καὶ μήτρας, εὐλογίας πατρός σου καὶ μητρός σου· ὑπερίσχυσεν 26
ἐπ᾽ εὐλογίαις ὀρέων μονίμων, καὶ ἐπ᾽ εὐλογίαις θινῶν ἀενάων· ἔσον-
ται ἐπὶ κεφαλῆς Ἰωσήφ, καὶ ἐπὶ κορυφῆς. Ὃν ἡγήσατο ἀδελφῶν·
Βενιαμὶν λύκος ἅρπαξ, τὸ πρωϊνὸν ἔδεται ἔτι, καὶ εἰς τὸ ἑσπέρας 27
διαδώσει τροφήν. Πάντες οὗτοι οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰακὼβ δώδεκα· καὶ ταῦ- 28
τα αὐτοῖς ἐλάλησεν ὁ πατὴρ αὐτῶν, καὶ ηὐλόγησεν αὐτοὺς ἕκα-
στον κατὰ τὴν εὐλογίαν αὐτοῦ ηὐλόγησεν αὐτούς. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐ- 29
τοῖς· ἐγὼ προστίθεμαι πρὸς τὸν ἐμὸν λαόν· θάψατέ με μετὰ τῶν
πατέρων μου ἐν τῷ σπηλαίῳ, ὅ ἐστιν ἐν τῷ ἀγρῷ Ἔφρων τοῦ Χετ-
ταίου, ἐν τῷ σπηλαίῳ τῷ διπλῷ τῷ ἀπέναντι Μαμβρῆ ἐν τῇ γῇ 30
Χαναάν, ὃ ἐκτήσατο Ἀβραὰμ τὸ σπήλαιον παρὰ Ἔφρων τοῦ Χετ-
ταίου ἐν κτήσει μνημείου. Ἐκεῖ ἔθαψαν Ἀβραὰμ καὶ Σάρραν τὴν 31
γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ· (καὶ) ἐκεῖ ἔθαψαν Ἰσαὰκ καὶ Ῥεβέκκαν τὴν γυ-
ναῖκα αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐκεῖ ἔθαψαν Λείαν, ἐν κτήσει τοῦ ἀγροῦ καὶ τοῦ 32
σπηλαίου τοῦ ὄντος ἐν αὐτῷ παρὰ τῶν υἱῶν Χέτ. Καὶ κατέπαυ- 33
σεν Ἰακὼβ ἐπιτάσσων τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐξέρας Ἰακὼβ τοὺς
πόδας αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν κλίνην, ἐξέλιπε, καὶ προσετέθη πρὸς τὸν
λαὸν αὐτοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. Ν΄. L.

ΚΑΙ ἐπιπεσὼν Ἰωσὴφ ἐπὶ πρόσωπον τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ, ἔκλαυ- 1
σεν ἐπ᾽ αὐτόν, καὶ ἐφίλησεν αὐτόν. Καὶ προσέταξεν Ἰωσὴφ τοῖς 2
παισὶν αὐτοῦ τοῖς ἐνταφιασταῖς, ἐνταφιάσαι τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ· καὶ
ἐνεταφίασαν οἱ ἐνταφιασταὶ τὸν Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἐπλήρωσαν αὐτοῦ 3
τεσσαράκοντα ἡμέρας· (οὕτω γὰρ καταριθμοῦνται αἱ ἡμέραι τῆς
ταφῆς) καὶ ἐπένθησεν αὐτὸν Αἴγυπτος ἑβδομήκοντα ἡμέρας. Ἐπεὶ 4
δὲ παρῆλθον αἱ ἡμέραι τοῦ πένθους, ἐλάλησεν Ἰωσὴφ πρὸς τοὺς

<div style="text-indent: 1em;">**26** They have surpassed the blessings of the lasting mountains, and the blessings of the everlasting hills. These shall be upon the head of Joseph, and upon the crown [of him] who was prince among his brethren.</div>
<div style="text-indent: 1em;">**27** Benjamin is a ravenous wolf; in the morning shall he yet devour, and in the evening shall he divide the spoil.</div>
<div style="text-indent: 1em;">**28** All these are the twelve sons of Jacob: and these things their father spake unto them, and blessed them; each one according to his own blessing did he bless them.</div>
<div style="text-indent: 1em;">**29** And he said unto them, "I am to be gathered unto my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave which is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,</div>
<div style="text-indent: 1em;">**30** in the double cave which is opposite Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham acquired, [even] the cave, from Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a burial place.</div>
<div style="text-indent: 1em;">**31** There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; (and) there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife;</div>
<div style="text-indent: 1em;">**32** and there they buried Leah, in the possession of the field and of the cave that is in it, from the sons of Heth."</div>
<div style="text-indent: 1em;">**33** And Jacob ceased, commanding his sons; and Jacob gathered up his feet into the bed, and he expired, and was gathered unto his people.</div>
