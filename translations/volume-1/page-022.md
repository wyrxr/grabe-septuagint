αὐτῆς δοῦναί σοι· στένων καὶ τρέμων ἔσῃ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς. Καὶ εἶπεν 13
Κάϊν πρὸς τὸν Κύριον· μείζων ἡ αἰτία μου τοῦ ἀφεθῆναί (με).
Εἰ ἐκβάλλεις με σήμερον ἀπὸ προσώπου τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ 14
προσώπου σου κρυβήσομαι, καὶ ἔσομαι στένων καὶ τρέμων ἐπὶ
τῆς γῆς· καὶ ἔσται, πᾶς ὁ εὑρίσκων με, ἀποκτενεῖ με. Καὶ εἶπεν 15
αὐτῷ Κύριος ὁ Θεός· οὐχ οὕτως· πᾶς ὁ ἀποκτείνας Κάϊν,
ἑπτὰ ἐκδικούμενα παραλύσει· καὶ ἔθετο Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς σημεῖον
τῷ Κάϊν, τοῦ μὴ ἀνελεῖν αὐτὸν πάντα τὸν εὑρίσκοντα αὐτόν. Ἐξῆλθε 16
δὲ Κάϊν ἀπὸ προσώπου τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ ᾤκησεν ἐν γῇ Ναὶδ
κατέναντι Ἐδέμ. Καὶ ἔγνω Κάϊν τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ, καὶ συλλαβοῦσα 17
ἔτεκε τὸν Ἑνώχ· καὶ ἦν οἰκοδομῶν πόλιν, καὶ ἐπωνόμασε
τὴν πόλιν ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ, Ἑνώχ. Ἐγενήθη δὲ 18
τῷ Ἑνὼχ Γαϊδὰδ· καὶ Γαϊδὰδ ἐγέννησε τὸν Μαϊὴλ· καὶ Μαϊὴλ
ἐγέννησε τὸν Μαθουσάλα· καὶ Μαθουσάλα ἐγέννησε τὸν Λάμεχ.
Καὶ ἔλαβεν ἑαυτῷ Λάμεχ δύο γυναῖκας· ὄνομα τῇ μιᾷ, Ἀδὰ 19
καὶ ὄνομα τῇ δευτέρᾳ, Σελλά. Καὶ ἔτεκεν Ἀδὰ τὸν Ἰωβὲλ· οὗτος 20
ἦν ὁ πατὴρ οἰκούντων ἐν σκηναῖς κτηνοτρόφων. Καὶ ὄνομα 21
τῷ ἀδελφῷ αὐτοῦ, Ἰουβάλ· οὗτος ἦν ὁ καταδείξας ψαλτήριον καὶ
κιθάραν. Σελλὰ δὲ ἔτεκε καὶ αὐτὴ τὸν Θόβελ· καὶ ἦν σφυροκόπος 22
χαλκεὺς χαλκοῦ καὶ σιδήρου· ἀδελφὴ δὲ Θόβελ, Νοεμά. Εἶπε δὲ 23
Λάμεχ ταῖς ἑαυτοῦ γυναιξίν, Ἀδὰ καὶ Σελλά· ἀκούσατέ μου τῆς
φωνῆς, γυναῖκες Λάμεχ, ἐνωτίσασθέ μου τοὺς λόγους· ὅτι ἄνδρα
ἀπέκτεινα εἰς τραῦμα ἐμοί, καὶ νεανίσκον εἰς μώλωπα ἐμοί· ὅτι 24
ἑπτάκις ἐκδέδικται ἐκ Κάϊν, ἐκ δὲ Λάμεχ ἑβδομηκοντάκις ἑπτά.
Ἔγνω δὲ Ἀδὰμ Εὔαν τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ, καὶ συλλαβοῦσα, ἔτεκεν 25
υἱὸν· καὶ ἐπωνόμασε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Σήθ, λέγουσα· ἐξανέστησε
γάρ μοι ὁ Θεὸς σπέρμα ἕτερον ἀντὶ Ἅβελ, ὃν ἀπέκτεινε
Κάϊν. Καὶ τῷ Σήθ ἐγένετο υἱός· ἐπωνόμασε δὲ τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ, 26
Ἐνώς· οὗτος ἤλπισεν ἐπικαλεῖσθαι τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. Ε΄. V.

ΑΥΤΗ ἡ βίβλος γενέσεως ἀνθρώπων, ᾗ ἡμέρα ἐποίησεν ὁ 1
Θεὸς τὸν Ἀδὰμ· κατ᾿ εἰκόνα Θεοῦ ἐποίησεν αὐτόν, ἄρσεν καὶ θῆλυ
ἐποίησεν αὐτούς· καὶ εὐλόγησεν αὐτούς, καὶ ἐπωνόμασε τὸ ὄνομα 2
αὐτῶν Ἀδάμ, ᾗ ἡμέρᾳ ἐποίησεν αὐτούς. Ἔζησε δὲ Ἀδὰμ διακόσια 3

**CHAPTER 4**

his hand to give [its strength] to thee. A groaner and a trembler shalt thou be upon the earth.

13 And Cain said unto the Lord,
"My crime is greater than that I should be forgiven.
14 Lo, if Thou castest me out this day from the face of the earth,
and from Thy presence shall I be hidden;
and I shall be a groaner and a trembler upon the earth;
and it shall come to pass, that every one who findeth me shall slay me."
15 And the Lord God said unto him,
"Not so! Whosoever slayeth Cain,
he shall unleash sevenfold vengeances."
And the Lord God set a mark upon Cain,
lest any one finding him should slay him.
16 And Cain went forth from the presence of God, and dwelt in the land of Naid, over against Eden.
17 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived and bore Enoch.
And he was building a city, and he named the city after the name of his son, Enoch.
18 And unto Enoch was born Gaidad;
and Gaidad begat Maiel;
and Maiel begat Mathusala;
and Mathusala begat Lamech.
19 And Lamech took unto himself two wives:
the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the second, Zillah.
20 And Adah bore Jabal;
he was the father of those who dwell in tents [and are] keepers of livestock.
21 And the name of his brother was Jubal;
he was the one who showed forth the psaltery and the lyre.
22 And Zillah, she also bore Tobel;
and he was a coppersmith, a worker in copper and iron;
and the sister of Tobel was Naämah.
23 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah:
"Hearken unto my voice, ye wives of Lamech;
give ear unto my words:
For I have slain a man for my wounding,
and a young man for my bruising.
24 If sevenfold is vengeance exacted for Cain,
then for Lamech, seventy times seven."
25 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bore a son;
and she named his name Seth, saying,
"For God hath raised up unto me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew."
26 And unto Seth was born a son;
and he named his name Enosh;
this one hoped to call upon the Name of the Lord God.

**CHAPTER 5**

1 This is the book of the generations of humanity, in the day that God made Adam.
In the image of God made He him,
male and female made He them;
2 and He blessed them, and called their name, Adam, in the day that He made them.
3 And Adam lived two hundred
