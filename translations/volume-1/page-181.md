Πᾶσαι αἱ πύλαι αἱ τῆς αὐλῆς ἐκ βύσσου κεκλωσμένης· καὶ αἱ
βάσεις τῶν στύλων χαλκαῖ, καὶ αἱ ἀγκύλαι αὐτῶν ἀργυραῖ, καὶ
αἱ κεφαλίδες αὐτῶν περιηργυρωμέναι ἀργυρίῳ, καὶ αἱ στύλοι πε-
ριηργυρωμένοι ἀργυρίῳ, καὶ πάντες οἱ στύλοι τῆς αὐλῆς. Καὶ τὸ
κατακάλυμμα τῆς πύλης τῆς αὐλῆς ἔργον ποικιλτοῦ ἐξ ὑακίνθου,
καὶ πορφύρας, καὶ κοκκίνου νενησμένου, καὶ βύσσου κεκλωσμέ-
νης· εἴκοσι πήχεων τὸ μῆκος, καὶ τὸ ὕψος καὶ τὸ εὖρος πέντε
πήχεων, ἐξισούμενον τοῖς ἱστίοις τῆς αὐλῆς· καὶ οἱ στύλοι αὐτῶν
τέσσαρες, καὶ αἱ βάσεις αὐτῶν τέσσαρες χαλκαῖ, καὶ αἱ ἀγκύλαι
αὐτῶν ἀργυραῖ, καὶ αἱ κεφαλίδες αὐτῶν περιηργυρωμέναι ἀργυρίῳ,
(καὶ αὐτοὶ περιηργυρωμένοι ἀργυρίῳ) · καὶ πάντες οἱ πάσσαλοι
τῆς αὐλῆς κύκλῳ χαλκοῖ. Καὶ αὕτη ἡ σύνταξις τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ
μαρτυρίου, καθὰ συνετάγη Μωυσῇ, τὴν λειτουργίαν εἶναι τῶν Λευ-
τῶν διὰ Ἰθάμαρ τοῦ υἱοῦ Ἀαρὼν τοῦ ἱερέως. Καὶ Βεσελεὴλ ὁ
τοῦ Οὐρί, ἐκ φυλῆς Ἰούδα, ἐποίησε καθὰ συνέταξε Κύριος τῷ
Μωυσῇ· καὶ Ἐλιὰβ ὁ τοῦ Ἀχισαμάχ, ἐκ φυλῆς Δάν, ὃς ἠρχιτε-
κτόνησε τὰ ὑφαντὰ καὶ ῥαφιδευτὰ καὶ ποικιλτά, ὑφᾶναι τῷ κοκ-
κίνῳ καὶ τῇ βύσσῳ.

ΚΕΦ. ΛΗ΄. XXXVIII.

ΚΑΙ ἐποίησε Βεσελεὴλ τὴν κιβωτόν, δύο πήχεων καὶ ἡμίσους
τὸ μῆχος αὐτῆς, καὶ πήχεως καὶ ἡμίσους τὸ πλάτος αὐτῆς, καὶ
πήχεως καὶ ἡμίσους τὸ ὕψος αὐτῆς· καὶ κατεχρύσωσεν αὐτὴν
χρυσίῳ καθαρῷ ἔσωθεν καὶ ἔξωθεν. Καὶ ἐποίησεν αὐτῇ κυμάτιον
χρυσοῦν κύκλῳ, καὶ ἐχώνευσεν αὐτῇ τέσσαρας δακτυλίους χρυ-
σοῦς ἐπὶ τὰ τέσσαρα μέρη αὐτῆς· δύο ἐπὶ τὸ κλίτος τὸ ἕν, καὶ
δύο ἐπὶ τὸ κλίτος τὸ δεύτερον, εὑρεῖς τοῖς διωστῆρσιν, ὥστε αἴ-
ρειν αὐτὴν ἐν αὐτοῖς. Καὶ ἐποίησε τὸ ἱλαστήριον ἄνωθεν τῆς κι-
βωτοῦ ἐκ χρυσίου καθαροῦ, καὶ ἐποίησε δύο Χερουβεὶμ χρυσοῦς·
(καὶ) Χεροὺβ ἕνα ἐπὶ τὸ ἄκρον τοῦ ἱλαστηρίου τὸ ἕν, καὶ Χεροὺβ
ἕνα ἐπὶ τὸ ἄκρον τὸ δεύτερον τοῦ ἱλαστηρίου, σκιάζοντα ταῖς πτέ-
ρυξιν αὐτῶν κατὰ πρόσωπον αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τὸ ἱλαστήριον. Καὶ ἐποίη-
σε τὴν τράπεζαν τὴν προκειμένην ἐκ χρυσίου καθαροῦ, καὶ ἐχώ-
νευσεν αὐτῇ τέσσαρας δακτυλίους χρυσοῦς· δύο δακτυλίους ἐπὶ τὸ
κλίτος τὸ ἕν, καὶ δύο δακτυλίους ἐπὶ τὸ κλίτος τὸ δεύτερον, εὑ-

**EXODUS. CHAPTER XXXVII.**

All the gates of the court were of fine linen, twisted; and the bases of the pillars were of bronze, and their hooks of silver, and their capitals overlaid with silver, and the pillars overlaid with silver, and all the pillars of the court. And the covering of the gate of the court was the work of an embroiderer, of hyacinth, and of purple, and of scarlet [yarn] spun, and of fine linen, twisted; twenty cubits was the length thereof, and the height and the breadth thereof five cubits, corresponding unto the hangings of the court; and their pillars were four, and their bases four were of bronze, and their hooks were of silver, and their capitals overlaid with silver, (and they themselves overlaid with silver); and all the pegs of the court round about were of bronze. And this is the reckoning of the Tabernacle of the Testimony, according as it was commanded unto Moses, that the service of the Levites should be through Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. And Bezalel the son of Uri, of the tribe of Judah, made [all] as the Lord commanded unto Moses; and Eliab the son of Achisamach, of the tribe of Dan, who did devise the woven, and the embroidered, and the variegated works, to weave with the scarlet and with the fine linen.

**CHAPTER XXXVIII.**

And Bezalel made the Ark, two cubits and a half was the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof; and he overlaid it with pure gold within and without. And he made unto it a golden molding round about, and he cast for it four rings of gold upon the four sides thereof; two upon the one side, and two upon the second side, broad for the poles, so as to lift it with them. And he made the Mercy Seat above the Ark of pure gold, and he made two golden Cherubim: (and) a Cherub one upon the one end of the Mercy Seat, and a Cherub one upon the second end of the Mercy Seat, overshadowing with their wings, their faces turned upon the Mercy Seat. And he made the Table of the Showbread of pure gold, and he cast for it four golden rings; two rings upon the one side, and two rings upon the second side, broad...
