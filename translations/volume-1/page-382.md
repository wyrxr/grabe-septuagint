ἐκπορεύεσθαι. Κύριος δὲ εἶπε πρὸς μέ· οὐ διαβήσῃ τὸν Ἰορδάνην
τούτον. Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου ὁ προπορευόμενος πρὸ προσώπου σου, 3
αὐτὸς ἐξολοθρεύσει τὰ ἔθνη ταῦτα ἀπὸ προσώπου σου, καὶ κατα-
κληρονομήσεις αὐτούς· καὶ Ἰησοῦς ὁ προπορευόμενος πρὸ προσώ-
που σου, καθὰ ἐλάλησε Κύριος. Καὶ ποιήσει αὐτοῖς Κύριος, καθὼς 4
ἐποίησε Σηὼν καὶ Ὤγ, δυσὶ βασιλεῦσι τῶν Ἀμοῤῥαίων, οἳ ἦσαν
πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου, καὶ τῇ γῇ αὐτῶν, καθότι ἐξωλόθρευσεν αὐτούς,
καὶ παρέδωκεν αὐτοὺς Κύριος ἐνώπιον ὑμῶν· καὶ ποιήσετε αὐ- 5
τοῖς, κατὰ πᾶσαν τὴν ἐντολήν, καθότι ἐνετειλάμην ὑμῖν. Ἀνδρίζου 6
καὶ ἴσχυε, μὴ φοβοῦ, μηδὲ δειλία, μηδὲ πτοηθῇς ἀπὸ προσώπου
αὐτῶν· ὅτι Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου οὗτος ὁ προπορευόμενος μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν,
οὐ μή σε ἀνῇ, οὐδ᾿ οὐ μή σε ἐγκαταλείπῃ. Καὶ ἐκάλεσε Μωυσῆς 7
Ἰησοῦν, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ἔναντι παντὸς Ἰσραήλ· ἀνδρίζου καὶ ἴσχυε·
σὺ γὰρ εἰσελεύσῃ πρὸ προσώπου τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου εἰς τὴν γῆν,
ἣν ὤμοσε Κύριος τοῖς πατράσιν αὐτῶν, δοῦναι αὐτοῖς, καὶ σὺ
κατακληρονομήσεις αὐτὴν αὐτοῖς· καὶ Κύριος αὐτὸς ὁ συμπροπο- 8
ρευόμενός σοι, αὐτὸς ἔσται μετὰ σοῦ, οὐκ ἀνήσει σε, οὐδ᾿ οὐ μή
ἐγκαταλείπῃ σε· μὴ φοβοῦ, μηδὲ δειλία. Καὶ ἔγραψε Μωυσῆς πάντα 9
τὰ ῥήματα τοῦ νόμου τούτου εἰς βιβλίον, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὸν
τοῖς ἱερεῦσι τοῖς υἱοῖς Λευί, τοῖς αἴρουσι τὴν κιβωτὸν τῆς δια-
θήκης Κυρίου, καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς πρεσβυτέροις τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ 10
ἐνετείλατο Μωυσῆς αὐτοῖς ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, λέγων· μετὰ ἑπτὰ
ἔτη ἐν καιρῷ ἐνιαυτοῦ ἀφέσεως, ἐν ἑορτῇ σκηνοπηγίας, ἐν τῷ 11
συμπορεύεσθαι πάντα Ἰσραήλ, ὀφθῆναι ἐνώπιον Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ
σου ἐν τῷ τόπῳ ὃν ἂν ἐκλέξηται Κύριος (ὁ Θεός σου), ἀναγνώ-
σεσθε τὸν νόμον τοῦτον ἐναντίον παντὸς Ἰσραήλ εἰς τὰ ὦτα αὐ-
τῶν. Ἐκκλησιάσατε τὸν λαόν, τοὺς ἄνδρας καὶ τὰς γυναῖκας καὶ 12
τὰ ἔκγονα, καὶ τὸν προσήλυτόν σου τὸν ἐν ταῖς πόλεσί σου, ἵνα
ἀκούσωσι, καὶ ἵνα μάθωσι φοβεῖσθαι Κύριον τὸν Θεὸν ὑμῶν, καὶ
ἀκούσονται ποιεῖν πάντας τοὺς λόγους τοῦ νόμου τούτου· καὶ οἱ 13
υἱοὶ αὐτῶν οἳ οὐκ οἴδασιν, ἀκούσονται, καὶ μαθήσονται φοβεῖσθαι
Κύριον τὸν Θεὸν ὑμῶν πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας, ὅσας αὐτοὶ ζῶσιν ἐπὶ
τῆς γῆς, εἰς ἣν ὑμεῖς διαβαίνετε τὸν Ἰορδάνην ἐκεῖ, κληρονομῆσαι
αὐτήν. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν· Ἰδοὺ ἐγγίκασιν αἱ ἡμέραι 14
τοῦ θανάτου σου· κάλεσον Ἰησοῦν, καὶ στῆτε παρὰ τὰς θύρας τῆς
σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου, καὶ ἐντελοῦμαι αὐτῷ. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη Μω-

**Deuteronomy 31**
2 to go out. But the Lord said unto me, "Thou shalt not cross this Jordan.
3 The Lord thy God, He it is that goeth before thy face; He shall destroy these nations from before thy face, and thou shalt inherit them. And Joshua, he that goeth before thy face, as the Lord hath spoken.
4 And the Lord shall do unto them as He did unto Sihon and unto Og, the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan, and unto their land, even as He destroyed them; and the Lord delivered them before you.
5 And ye shall do unto them according to all the commandment which I have commanded you.
6 Be strong and courageous, fear not, neither be faint-hearted, nor be dismayed before their face; for the Lord thy God, He it is that goeth with you; He will not fail thee, nor forsake thee."
7 And Moses called Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all Israel, "Be strong and courageous; for thou shalt go in before the face of this people into the land which the Lord sware unto their fathers to give them, and thou shalt cause them to inherit it.
8 And the Lord Himself, He that goeth with thee, He shall be with thee; He will not fail thee, nor forsake thee; fear not, neither be faint-hearted."
9 And Moses wrote all the words of this law in a book, and gave it unto the priests, the sons of Levi, who bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and unto all the elders of the sons of Israel.
10 And Moses commanded them in that day, saying, "After seven years, at the time of the year of release, in the Feast of Tabernacles,
11 when all Israel cometh to appear before the Lord thy God in the place which the Lord (thy God) shall choose, ye shall read this law before all Israel in their ears.
12 Assemble the people, the men and the women and the children, and thy sojourner that is within thy cities, that they may hear, and that they may learn to fear the Lord your God, and they shall hear to do all the words of this law.
13 And their sons, who know not, they shall hear, and shall learn to fear the Lord your God all the days that they live upon the land, whither ye cross over Jordan there, to inherit it."
14 And the Lord said unto Moses, "Behold, the days of thy death draw nigh; call Joshua, and stand ye by the doors of the tabernacle of testimony, and I will give him a charge." And Moses went...
