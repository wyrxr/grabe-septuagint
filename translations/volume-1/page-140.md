14 Ἰδοὺ ἐπὶ πρόσωπον τῆς ἐρήμου λεπτὸν ὡσεὶ χόριον, λεπτὸν ὡσεὶ πάγος ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς. 15 Ἰδόντες δὲ οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ, εἶπαν ἕτερος τῷ ἑτέρῳ· τί ἐστι τοῦτο; οὐ γὰρ ᾔδεισαν τί ἦν. Εἶπε δὲ Μωυσῆς πρὸς αὐτούς· οὗτος ὁ ἄρτος, ὃν ἔδωκε Κύριος ὑμῖν φαγεῖν. 16 Τοῦτο τὸ ῥῆμα ὃ συνέταξε Κύριος· συναγάγετε ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἕκαστος εἰς τοὺς καθήκοντας, γομὸρ κατὰ κεφαλὴν κατὰ ἀριθμὸν ψυχῶν ὑμῶν· ἕκαστος ἐν τοῖς συσκήνοις ὑμῶν συλλέξατε. 17 Καὶ ἐποίησαν οὕτως οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ συνέλεξαν ᾧ τὸ πολὺ καὶ ᾧ τὸ ἔλαττον· 18 καὶ μετρήσαντες τῷ γομόρ, οὐκ ἐπλεόνασεν ᾧ τὸ πολύ, καὶ ᾧ τὸ ὀλίγον, οὐκ ἠλαττόνησεν· ἕκαστος εἰς τοὺς καθήκοντας παρ᾿ αὑτῷ συνέλεξαν. 19 Εἶπε δὲ Μωυσῆς πρὸς αὐτούς· μηδεὶς καταλειπέτω εἰς τὸ πρωΐ ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ. 20 Καὶ οὐκ εἰσήκουσαν Μωυσῆ, ἀλλὰ κατέλιπόν τινες ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸ πρωΐ· καὶ ἐξέζεσεν σκώληκας, καὶ ἐπώζεσεν· καὶ ἐπικράνθη Μωυσῆς ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῖς. 21 Καὶ συνέλεξαν αὐτὸ πρωΐ πρωΐ, ἕκαστος τὸ καθῆκον αὑτῷ· ἡνίκα δὲ διεθέρμαινεν ὁ ἥλιος, ἐτήκετο. 22 Ἐγένετο δὲ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἕκτῃ, συνέλεξαν τὰ δέοντα διπλᾶ δύο γομὸρ τῷ ἑνί· εἰσῆλθον δὲ πάντες οἱ ἄρχοντες τῆς συναγωγῆς, καὶ ἀνήγγειλαν Μωυσῇ. 23 Εἶπε δὲ Μωυσῆς· πρὸς αὐτούς· τοῦτο τὸ ῥῆμά ἐστιν ὃ ἐλάλησε Κύριος· σάββατα ἀνάπαυσις ἁγία τῷ Κυρίῳ αὔριον· ὅσα ἐὰν πέσσητε, πέσσετε, καὶ ὅσα ἂν ἔψητε, ἔψετε· καὶ πᾶν τὸ πλεονάζον καταλείπετε αὐτοῖς εἰς ἀποθήκην ἕως πρωΐ. 24 Καὶ κατέλιπον ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἕως πρωΐ, καθάπερ συνέταξεν αὐτοῖς Μωυσῆς· καὶ οὐκ ἐπώζεσεν, οὐδὲ σκώληξ ἐγένετο ἐν αὐτῷ. 25 Εἶπε δὲ Μωυσῆς· φάγετε αὐτὸ σήμερον· ἔστι γὰρ σάββατα τῷ Κυρίῳ σήμερον· οὐχ εὑρήσετε σήμερον ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ. 26 Ἕξ ἡμέρας συλλέξετε, τῇ δὲ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ σάββατα οὐκ ἔσται ἐν αὐτῇ. 27 Ἐγένετο δὲ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ, ἐξῆλθόν τινες ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ συλλέξαι, καὶ οὐχ εὗρον. 28 Εἶπε δὲ Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν· ἕως τίνος οὐ βούλεσθε εἰσακούειν τὰς ἐντολάς μου καὶ τὸν νόμον μου; 29 Ἰδέτε, ὁ γὰρ Κύριος ἔδωκεν ὑμῖν τὴν ἡμέραν ταύτην καὶ τὰ σάββατα· διὰ τοῦτο αὐτὸς ἔδωκεν ὑμῖν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἕκτῃ ἄρτους δύο ἡμερῶν· καθήσεσθε ἕκαστος εἰς τοὺς οἴκους ὑμῶν, μηδεὶς ὑμῶν ἐκπορευέσθω (ἕκαστος) ἐκ τοῦ τόπου αὑτοῦ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ. 30 Καὶ ἐσαββάτισεν ὁ λαὸς τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ. 31 Καὶ ἐπωνόμασαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ, Μάν· ἦν δὲ ὡς σπέρμα κορίου, λευκόν· τὸ δὲ γεῦμα αὐτοῦ ὡς ἐγκρίς

**English Translation:**
**Chapter XVI.**

14 And behold, upon the face of the wilderness, there was a thin thing like unto coriander seed, thin as frost upon the earth.

15 And when the sons of Israel saw it, they said one to another, "What is this?" For they knew not what it was. And Moses said unto them, "This is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat.

16 This is the word which the Lord hath commanded: Gather ye of it every man for those who belong to him, a gomor for each head, according to the number of your souls; each one among those who dwell with him, shall ye gather."

17 And the sons of Israel did so, and they gathered, some much and some little.

18 And when they measured it with the gomor, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; each man gathered for those belonging to him, by himself.

19 And Moses said unto them, "Let no man leave of it until the morning."

20 But they hearkened not unto Moses; for some of them left of it until the morning, and it teemed with worms, and it stank; and Moses was wroth with them.

21 And they gathered it morning by morning, every man according to what was due to him; but when the sun waxed hot, it melted.

22 And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two gomors for each one; and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.

23 Then Moses said unto them, "This is the word which the Lord hath spoken: tomorrow is the rest of the holy Sabbath unto the Lord. Whatsoever ye shall bake, bake; and whatsoever ye shall boil, boil; and all that remaineth over, lay up for yourselves to be kept until the morning."

24 And they left of it until the morning, as Moses had commanded them; and it stank not, neither was there any worm therein.

25 And Moses said, "Eat that today; for today is a Sabbath unto the Lord; today ye shall not find it in the field.

26 Six days shall ye gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the Sabbath, there shall be none therein."

27 And it came to pass that on the seventh day, some of the people went out to gather, and they found none.

28 And the Lord said unto Moses, "How long refuse ye to hearken unto My commandments and My law?

29 Behold, for the Lord hath given you this day and the Sabbaths; therefore He hath given you on the sixth day bread for two days. Sit ye every man in his houses; let none of you go out [each one] from his place on the seventh day."

30 So the people rested on the seventh day.

31 And the sons of Israel called the name thereof, Manna; and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like a honey-cake.
