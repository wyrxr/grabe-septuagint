μου, καὶ λήψῃ γυναῖκα τῷ υἱῷ μου ἐκεῖθεν. Εἶπα δὲ τῷ κυρίῳ 39
μου· μήποτε οὐ πορευθῇ ἡ γυνή μετ᾽ ἐμοῦ. Καὶ εἶπέ μοι· Κύριος 40
(ὁ Θεὸς) ᾧ εὐηρέστησα ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ, αὐτὸς ἐξαποστελεῖ τὸν ἄγ-
γελόν αὐτοῦ μετὰ σοῦ, καὶ εὐοδώσει τὴν ὁδόν σου· καὶ λήψῃ γυ-
ναῖκα τῷ υἱῷ μου ἐκ τῆς φυλῆς μου, καὶ ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ πατρός
μου. Τότε ἀθῶος ἔσῃ ἐκ τῆς ἀρᾶς μου· ἡνίκα γὰρ ἐὰν ἔλθῃς εἰς 41
τὴν φυλὴν μου, καὶ μὴ δώσω σοι, καὶ ἔσῃ ἀθῶος ἀπὸ τοῦ ὁρκισμοῦ
μου. Καὶ ἐλθὼν σήμερον ἐπὶ τὴν πηγήν, εἶπα· Κύριε ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ 42
κυρίου μου Ἀβραάμ, εἰ σὺ εὐοδοῖς τὴν ὁδόν μου, ἣν νῦν ἐγὼ
πορεύομαι ἐπ᾽ αὐτήν· Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἕστηκα ἐπὶ τὴν πηγὴν τοῦ ὕδατος, 43
καὶ αἱ θυγατέρες τῶν ἀνθρώπων τῆς πόλεως ἐξελεύσονται ὑδρεύ-
σασθαι ὕδωρ· καὶ ἔσται ἡ παρθένος, ᾗ ἂν ἐγὼ εἴπω· πότισόν με
μικρὸν ὕδωρ ἐκ τῆς ὑδρίας σου, καὶ εἴπῃ μοι· καὶ σὺ πίε, καὶ 44
ταῖς καμήλοις σου ὑδρεύσομαι· αὕτη ἡ γυνή, ἣν ἡτοίμασε Κύριος
τῷ ἑαυτοῦ θεράποντι Ἰσαάκ· καὶ ἐν τούτῳ γνώσομαι, ὅτι πεποίη-
κας ἔλεος τῷ κυρίῳ μου Ἀβραάμ. Καὶ ἐγένετο πρὸ τοῦ συντελέ- 45
σαι με λαλοῦντα ἐν τῇ διανοίᾳ μου, εὐθὺς Ῥεβέκκα ἐξεπορεύετο
ἔχουσα τὴν ὑδρίαν ἐπὶ τῶν ὤμων· καὶ κατέβη ἐπὶ τὴν πηγήν, καὶ
ὑδρεύσατο. Εἶπα δὲ αὐτῇ· πότισόν με. Καὶ σπεύσασα καθεῖλε τὴν 46
ὑδρίαν (ἐπὶ τὸν βραχίονα) αὐτῆς ἀφ᾽ ἑαυτῆς, καὶ εἶπε· πίε σύ, καὶ
τὰς καμήλους σου ποτιῶ· καὶ ἔπιον, καὶ τὰς καμήλους μου ἐπό-
τισε. Καὶ ἠρώτησα αὐτήν, καὶ εἶπα· τίνος θυγάτης εἶ; (ἀνάγγει- 47
λόν μοι.) Ἡ δὲ ἔφη· θυγάτηρ Βαθουὴλ εἰμι ἐγώ, τοῦ υἱοῦ Ναχώρ,
ὃν ἔτεκεν αὐτῷ Μελχά. Καὶ περιέθηκα αὐτῇ τὰ ἐνώτια, καὶ τὰ
ψέλλια ἐπὶ τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῆς· καὶ εὐδοκήσας προσεκύνησα Κυρίῳ, 48
καὶ εὐλόγησα Κύριον τὸν Θεὸν τοῦ κυρίου μου Ἀβραάμ, ὃς εὐο-
δώσε με ἐν ὁδῷ ἀληθείας, λαβεῖν τὴν θυγατέρα τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ τοῦ
κυρίου μου τῷ υἱῷ αὐτοῦ. Εἰ οὖν ποιεῖτε ὑμεῖς ἔλεος καὶ δικαιο- 49
σύνην πρὸς τὸν κύριόν μου, ἀπαγγείλατέ μοι· εἰ δὲ μή, ἀπαγ-
γείλατέ μοι, ἵνα ἐπιστρέψω εἰς δεξιάν ἢ εἰς ἀριστεράν. Ἀποκρι- 50
θεὶς δὲ Λάβαν καὶ Βαθουήλ, εἶπαν· παρὰ Κυρίου ἐξῆλθε τὸ πρό-
σταγμα τοῦτο· οὐ δυνήσόμεθα οὖν σοι ἀντειπεῖν κακὸν καλῷ. Ἰδοὺ 51
Ῥεβέκκα ἐνώπιόν σου· λαβὼν ἀπότρεχε, καὶ ἔστω γυνὴ τῷ υἱῷ
τοῦ κυρίου σου, καθὰ ἐλάλησε Κύριος. Ἐγένετο δὲ ἐν τῷ ἀκοῦσαι 52
τὸν παῖδα τὸν Ἀβραὰμ τῶν ῥημάτων αὐτῶν, προσεκύνησεν ἐπὶ
τὴν γῆν Κυρίῳ. Καὶ ἐξενέγκας ὁ παῖς σκεύη ἀργυρᾶ καὶ σκεύη 53

**Genesis, Chapter 24**

39 [my kindred], and thou shalt take a wife for my son from thence.
And I said unto my lord,

40 Peradventure the woman will not go with me.
And he said unto me:
The Lord (even God), before Whom I have walked [in His favor],
He Himself shall send His angel with thee, and make thy way prosperous;
And thou shalt take a wife for my son
From my kindred, and from the house of my father.

41 Then shalt thou be clear from my curse:
For whensoever thou comest unto my kindred,
And [if] I give not [her] to thee,
Then shalt thou be clear from my oath.

42 And I came this day unto the well, and said:
O Lord God of my master Abraham,
If now Thou wilt prosper my way, which I now journey upon:

43 Behold, I stand by the well of water;
And the daughters of the men of the city shall come forth to draw water.

44 And it shall be the maiden to whom I shall say,
Give me to drink a little water from thy pitcher;
And she shall say unto me,
Drink thou also, and I will draw for thy camels:
This [is] the woman, whom the Lord hath prepared for His own servant Isaac.
And by this shall I know that Thou hast shown mercy unto my master Abraham.

45 And it came to pass, before I had finished speaking in my heart,
That forthwith Rebekah came forth, having her pitcher upon her shoulder;
And she went down unto the well, and drew water.

46 And I said unto her, Give me to drink.
And she hastened and let down her pitcher (upon her arm) from herself,
And said, Drink thou, and I will water thy camels.
And I drank, and she watered my camels.

47 And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou?
(Tell me.)
And she said, I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Nahor,
Whom Milcah bare unto him.

48 And I put upon her the earrings, and the bracelets upon her hands;
And being well-pleased, I bowed down unto the Lord,
And blessed the Lord God of my master Abraham,
Who hath prospered me in a way of truth,
To take the daughter of my master's brother for his son.

49 Now if ye will show mercy and righteousness toward my master, tell me;
And if not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.

50 Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said:
From the Lord hath this decree proceeded;
We cannot therefore speak unto thee bad or good.

51 Behold, Rebekah [is] before thee;
Take [her] and go, and let her be a wife for the son of thy master,
As the Lord hath spoken.

52 And it came to pass, when the servant of Abraham heard their words,
He bowed down upon the earth unto the Lord.

53 And the servant brought forth articles of silver and articles
