ἔχει ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς πάντα τὰ ῥήματα τὰ καλὰ ἃ ἐλάλησε Κύριος ὁ
Θεὸς ὑμῶν ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς, οὕτως ἐπάξει Κύριος ἐφ᾿ ὑμᾶς πάντα τὰ
ῥήματα τὰ πονηρά, ἕως ἂν ἐξολοθρεύσῃ ὑμᾶς ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς τῆς
ἀγαθῆς ταύτης, ἧς ἔδωκεν ὑμῖν Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν· ἐν τῷ **παραβαίνειν** 16
ὑμᾶς τὴν διαθήκην Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ὑμῶν, ἣν ἐνετείλατο
ὑμῖν, καὶ πορευθέντες λατρεύσητε θεοῖς ἑτέροις, καὶ προσκυνήσητε
αὐτοῖς· καὶ ὀργισθήσεται θυμῷ Κύριος ἐν ὑμῖν, καὶ ἀπολεῖσθε τὸ
τάχος ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς τῆς ἀγαθῆς, ἧς ἔδωκεν ὑμῖν.

ΚΕΦ. ΚΔʹ. XXIV.

ΚΑὶ συνήγαγεν Ἰησοῦς πάσας τὰς φυλὰς Ἰσραὴλ ἐν Σηλώ, 1
καὶ συνεκάλεσε (πάντας) τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους Ἰσραήλ, καὶ τοὺς **ἄρχοντας** αὐτῶν, καὶ τοὺς γραμματεῖς αὐτῶν, καὶ τοὺς δικαστὰς
αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔστησαν ἐναντίον τοῦ Θεοῦ. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰησοῦς πρὸς 2
πάντα τὸν λαόν, (λέγων)· τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ Ἰσραήλ,
(λέγων)· πέραν τοῦ ποταμοῦ παρώκησαν οἱ πατέρες ὑμῶν τὸ **ἀπαρχῆς**, Θάρα ὁ πατὴρ Ἀβραὰμ καὶ ὁ πατὴρ Ναχώρ, καὶ ἐλάτρευ-
σαν θεοῖς ἑτέροις. Καὶ ἔλαβον τὸν πατέρα ὑμῶν τὸν Ἀβραὰμ ἐκ 3
τοῦ πέραν τοῦ ποταμοῦ, καὶ ὡδήγησα αὐτὸν ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ Χα-
ναάν, καὶ ἐπλήθυνα τὸ σπέρμα αὐτοῦ, καίγε ἔδωκα αὐτῷ τὸν
Ἰσαάκ· καὶ ἔδωκα τῷ Ἰσαὰκ τὸν Ἰακὼβ καὶ τὸν Ἡσαῦ· καὶ 4
ἔδωκα τῷ Ἡσαῦ τὸ ὄρος τὸ Σηεὶρ κληρονομίαν αὐτῷ· καὶ Ἰακὼβ
καὶ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ κατέβησαν εἰς Αἴγυπτον, καὶ ἐγένοντο ἐκεῖ εἰς ἔθνος
μέγα καὶ πολὺ καὶ κραταιόν, καὶ ἐκάκωσαν αὐτοὺς οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι.
Καὶ ἀπέστειλα Μωυσῆν καὶ Ἀαρών· καὶ ἐπάταξε Κύριος τὴν 5
Αἴγυπτον ἐν σημείοις οἷς ἐποίησεν ἐν αὐτοῖς, καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα ἐξή-
γαγεν ὑμᾶς· καὶ ἐξήγαγον τοὺς πατέρας ὑμῶν ἐξ Αἰγύπτου, καὶ 6
εἰσήλθατε εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν· καὶ κατεδίωξαν οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι ὀπίσω
τῶν πατέρων ὑμῶν ἐν ἅρμασι καὶ ἐν ἵπποις εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν τὴν
ἐρυθράν. Καὶ ἀνεβοήσαμεν πρὸς Κύριον, καὶ ἔδωκε νεφέλην καὶ 7
γνόφον ἀναμέσον ὑμῶν καὶ ἀναμέσον τῶν Αἰγυπτίων, καὶ ἀπήγα-
γεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς τὴν θάλασσαν, καὶ ἐκάλυψεν (ἐπ᾿) αὐτούς· καὶ
ἴδοσαν οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ ὑμῶν ὅσα ἐποίησε Κύριος ἐν τῇ Αἰγύπτῳ, καὶ
ἦτε ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ ἡμέρας πλείους. Καὶ ἤγαγεν ὑμᾶς εἰς γῆν **Ἀμορραίων** 8
τῶν κατοικούντων πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου, καὶ παρετάξαντο

**Joshua 23**
<sup>15</sup> And it shall come to pass, in like manner, [as there have come to pass] upon you all the good words which the LORD your God hath spoken upon you, so shall the LORD bring upon you all the evil words, until He utterly destroy you from off this good land, which the LORD your God hath given unto you.
<sup>16</sup> For when ye shall transgress the covenant of the LORD your God, which He hath commanded you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them, then shall the LORD be wroth with fierce anger upon you, and ye shall perish with haste from off this good land, which He hath given unto you.

**Joshua 24**
<sup>1</sup> And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shiloh, and called together (all) the elders of Israel, and their chiefs, and their scribes, and their judges; and they stood before God.
<sup>2</sup> And Joshua said unto all the people, (saying), Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, (saying), Your fathers dwelt beyond the River from the first, [even] Terah, the father of Abraham and the father of Nahor; and they served other gods.
<sup>3</sup> And I took your father Abraham from beyond the River, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan; and I multiplied his seed, and indeed I gave him Isaac.
<sup>4</sup> And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau; and I gave unto Esau Mount Seir for his inheritance; and Jacob and his sons went down into Egypt, and they became there a great and numerous and mighty nation, and the Egyptians afflicted them.
<sup>5</sup> And I sent Moses and Aaron; and the LORD smote Egypt with the signs which He wrought in them, and after these things I brought you forth.
<sup>6</sup> And I brought your fathers out of Egypt, and ye came to the sea; and the Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and with horsemen into the Red Sea.
<sup>7</sup> And we cried unto the LORD, and He put a cloud and thick darkness between you and between the Egyptians; and He brought the sea upon them, and covered (them) over; and your eyes saw what great things the LORD did in Egypt, and ye were in the wilderness for many days.
<sup>8</sup> And He brought you into the land of the Amorites, who dwelt beyond the Jordan; and they arrayed themselves [against you].
