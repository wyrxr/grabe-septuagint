ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ
ΚΕΦ. ΛΒ΄.
8 τὰς καμήλους, καὶ τὰ πρόβατα, εἰς δύο παρεμβολάς. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰακώβ· ἐὰν ἔλθῃ Ἠσαῦ εἰς παρεμβολὴν μίαν, καὶ ἐκκόψῃ αὐτήν,
9 ἔσται ἡ παρεμβολὴ ἡ δευτέρα εἰς τὸ σώζεσθαι. Εἶπε δὲ Ἰακώβ·
10 ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ πατρὸς μου Ἀβραάμ, καὶ ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ πατρὸς μου Ἰσαάκ, Κύριε, ὃ εἶπας μοι, ἀπότρεχε εἰς τὴν γῆν τῆς γενέσεώς σου, καὶ εὖ σε ποιήσω, ἱκανοῦταί μοι ἀπὸ πάσης δικαιοσύνης, καὶ ἀπὸ πάσης ἀληθείας ἧς ἐποίησας τῷ παιδί σου· ἐν γὰρ τῇ ῥάβ-
11 δῳ μου διέβην τὸν Ἰορδάνην τοῦτον, νῦν δὲ γέγονα εἰς δύο παρεμβολάς. Ἐξελοῦ με ἐκ χειρὸς τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ μου, ἐκ χειρὸς Ἠσαῦ· ὅτι φοβοῦμαι ἐγὼ αὐτόν, μή ποτε ἐλθὼν πατάξῃ με, καὶ
12 μητέρα ἐπὶ τέκνοις. Σὺ δὲ εἶπας· καλῶς εὖ σε ποιήσω, καὶ θήσω τὸ σπέρμα σου ὡς τὴν ἄμμον τῆς θαλάσσης, ἢ οὐκ ἀριθμηθήσεται ἀπὸ τοῦ πλήθους.
13 Καὶ ἐκοιμήθη ἐκεῖ τὴν νύκτα ἐκείνην· καὶ ἔλαβεν ὧν ἔφερεν ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ δῶρα, καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν Ἠσαῦ τῷ ἀδελφῷ αὐτοῦ,
14 αἶγας διακοσίας, τράγους εἴκοσι, πρόβατα
15 διακόσια, κριοὺς εἴκοσι, καμήλους θηλαζούσας καὶ τὰ παιδία αὑτῶν τριάκοντα, βόας τεσσαράκοντα, ταύρους δέκα, ὄνους εἴκοσι,
16 καὶ πώλους δέκα. Καὶ ἔδωκε διὰ χειρὸς τοῖς παισὶν αὐτοῦ ποίμνιον κατὰ μόνας. Εἶπε δὲ τοῖς παισὶν αὐτοῦ· προπορεύεσθε ἔμπροσθέν μου, καὶ διάστημα ποιεῖτε ἀνὰ μέσον ποίμνης καὶ ποί-
17 μνης. Καὶ ἐνετείλατο τῷ πρώτῳ, λέγων· ἐάν σοι συναντήσῃ Ἠσαῦ ὁ ἀδελφός μου, καὶ ἐρωτᾷ σε, λέγων· τίνος εἶ, καὶ ποῦ πορεύῃ,
18 καὶ τίνος ταῦτα τὰ προπορευόμενά σου; καὶ ἐρεῖς· τοῦ παιδός σου Ἰακώβ· δῶρα ἀπέσταλκε τῷ κυρίῳ μου Ἠσαῦ· καὶ ἰδοὺ αὐτὸς
19 ὀπίσω ἡμῶν. Καὶ ἐνετείλατο τῷ πρώτῳ, καὶ τῷ δευτέρῳ, καὶ τῷ τρίτῳ, καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς προπορευομένοις ὀπίσω τῶν ποιμνίων τού-
20 των, λέγων· κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο λαλήσατε τῷ Ἠσαῦ ἐν τῷ εὑρεῖν ὑμᾶς αὐτόν, καὶ ἐρεῖτε· ἰδοὺ ὁ παῖς σου Ἰακὼβ παραγίνεται ὀπίσω ἡμῶν· εἶπε γάρ· ἐξιλάσομαι τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἐν τοῖς δώροις τοῖς προπορευομένοις αὐτοῦ, καὶ μετὰ τοῦτο ὄψομαι τὸ
21 πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ· ἴσως γὰρ προσδέξεται τὸ πρόσωπόν μου. Καὶ προεπορεύετο τὰ δῶρα κατὰ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ· αὐτὸς δὲ ἐκοιμήθη
22 τὴν νύκτα ἐκείνην ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ. Ἀναστὰς δὲ τὴν νύκτα ἐκείνην, ἔλαβε τὰς δύο γυναῖκας, καὶ τὰς δύο παιδίσκας, καὶ τὰ ἕνδεκα
23 παιδία αὐτοῦ, καὶ διέβη τὴν διάβασιν τοῦ Ἰαβώχ· καὶ ἔλαβεν αὐτούς, καὶ διέβη τὸν χειμάῤῥουν, καὶ διεβίβασε πάντα τὰ αὐτοῦ.

### Literary English Translation

**Genesis, Chapter 32**

**8** the camels, and the sheep, into two companies. And Jacob said, If Esau come unto one company, and smite it,
**9** then shall the second company be saved. And Jacob said,
**10** O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O Lord, who saidst unto me, Return unto the land of thy birth, and I will surely do thee good; it hath been made sufficient unto me from all righteousness, and from all truth which Thou hast wrought for Thy servant:
**11** for with my staff I passed over this Jordan, but now am I become two companies. Deliver me, I pray Thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, lest peradventure he come and smite me, and
**12** the mother upon the children. But Thou hast said, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.

**13** And he lodged there that same night; and he took that which came to his hand [as] presents, and sent [them] to Esau his brother:
**14** two hundred she-goats, and twenty he-goats; two hundred sheep,
**15** and twenty rams; thirty milch camels with their colts; forty kine, and ten bulls; twenty she-asses,
**16** and ten foals. And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves. And he said unto his servants, Pass ye on before me, and make a space betwixt drove and drove.
**17** And he commanded the foremost, saying, If Esau my brother meet thee, and ask thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou?
**18** and whose are these that go before thee? Then thou shalt say, [They are] thy servant Jacob’s; a present hath he sent unto my lord Esau; and behold, he himself [is] behind us.
**19** And he commanded the first, and the second, and the third, and all that went after the droves,
**20** saying, After this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him; and ye shall say, Behold, thy servant Jacob cometh behind us. For he said, I will appease his countenance with the presents that go before him, and after that I will see his countenance;
**21** for peradventure he will accept my countenance. So the presents went on before him: and he himself lodged
**22** that same night in the company. And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two maidservants, and his eleven
**23** children, and passed over the ford of Jabbok. And he took them, and passed over the torrent, and carried over all that he had.
