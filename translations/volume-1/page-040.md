ΚΕΦ. ΙΖʹ. ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ 25
καὶ βασιλεῖς ἐκ σοῦ ἐξελεύσονται. Καὶ στήσω τὴν διαθήκην μου 7
ἀνὰ μέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον σου, καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον τοῦ σπέρμα-
τός σου μετὰ σὲ εἰς γενεὰς αὐτῶν, εἰς διαθήκην αἰώνιον, εἶναί
σου Θεός, καὶ τοῦ σπέρματός σου μετὰ σέ· καὶ δώσω σοι καὶ τῷ 8
σπέρματί σου μετὰ σὲ τὴν γῆν ἣν παροικεῖς, πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν Χα-
ναάν, εἰς κατάσχεσιν αἰώνιον, καὶ ἔσομαι αὐτοῖς Θεός. Καὶ εἶ- 9
πεν ὁ Θεὸς πρὸς Ἀβραάμ· σὺ δὲ τὴν διαθήκην μου διατηρήσεις,
σὺ καὶ τὸ σπέρμα σου μετὰ σὲ εἰς τὰς γενεὰς αὐτῶν. Καὶ αὕτη 10
ἡ διαθήκη, ἣν διατηρήσεις ἀνὰ μέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ ὑμῶν, καὶ ἀνὰ μέ-
σον τοῦ σπέρματός σου μετὰ σὲ εἰς τὰς γενεὰς αὐτῶν· περιτμη-
θήσεται ὑμῶν πᾶν ἀρσενικόν, καὶ περιτμηθήσεσθε τὴν σάρκα τῆς 11
ἀκροβυστίας ὑμῶν, καὶ ἔσται ἐν σημείῳ διαθήκης ἀνὰ μέσον ἐμοῦ
καὶ ὑμῶν. Καὶ παιδίον ὀκτὼ ἡμερῶν περιτμηθήσεται ὑμῖν, πᾶν ἀρ- 12
σενικὸν εἰς τὰς γενεὰς ὑμῶν· ὁ οἰκογενὴς τῆς οἰκίας σου καὶ ὁ
ἀργυρώνητος ἀπὸ παντὸς υἱοῦ ἀλλοτρίου, ὃς οὐκ ἔστιν ἐκ τοῦ
σπέρματός σου· περιτομῇ περιτμηθήσεται ὁ οἰκογενὴς τῆς οἰκίας 13
σου, καὶ ὁ ἀργυρώνητος· καὶ ἔσται ἡ διαθήκη μου ἐπὶ τῆς σαρ-
κὸς ὑμῶν εἰς διαθήκην αἰώνιον. Καὶ ἀπερίτμητος ἄρσην, ὃς οὐ 14
περιτμηθήσεται τὴν σάρκα τῆς ἀκροβυστίας αὐτοῦ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ
ὀγδόῃ, ἐξολοθρευθήσεται ἡ ψυχὴ ἐκείνη ἐκ τοῦ γένους αὐτῆς· ὅτι
τὴν διαθήκην μου διεσκέδασεν. Εἶπε δὲ ὁ Θεὸς τῷ Ἀβραάμ· Σάρρα 15
ἡ γυνή σου οὐ κληθήσεται τὸ ὄνομα αὐτῆς Σαρά, ἀλλὰ Σάρρα
ἔσται τὸ ὄνομα αὐτῆς. Εὐλογήσω δὲ αὐτήν, καὶ δώσω σοι ἐξ αὐ- 16
τῆς τέκνον· καὶ εὐλογήσω αὐτόν, καὶ ἔσται εἰς ἔθνη, καὶ βασιλεῖς
ἐθνῶν ἐξ αὐτοῦ ἔσονται. Καὶ ἔπεσεν Ἀβραὰμ ἐπὶ πρόσωπον αὐ- 17
τοῦ, καὶ ἐγέλασε, καὶ εἶπεν ἐν τῇ διανοίᾳ αὐτοῦ, λέγων· εἰ τῷ
ἑκατονταετεῖ γενήσεται υἱός; καὶ εἰ Σάρρα ἐνενήκοντα ἐτῶν τέ-
ξεται; Εἶπε δὲ Ἀβραὰμ πρὸς τὸν Θεόν· Ἰσμαὴλ οὗτος ζήτω ἐ- 18
ναντίον σου. Εἶπε δὲ ὁ Θεὸς τῷ Ἀβραάμ· ναί, ἰδοὺ Σάρρα ἡ 19
γυνή σου τέξεται σοι υἱόν, καὶ καλέσεις τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ἰσαάκ·
καὶ στήσω τὴν διαθήκην μου πρὸς αὐτὸν εἰς διαθήκην αἰώνιον,
καὶ τῷ σπέρματι αὐτοῦ μετ᾽ αὐτόν. Περὶ δὲ Ἰσμαὴλ ἰδοὺ ἐπή- 20
κουσά σου· καὶ ἰδοὺ εὐλόγησα αὐτόν, καὶ αὐξανῶ αὐτόν, καὶ πλη-
θυνῶ αὐτὸν σφόδρα σφόδρα· δώδεκα ἔθνη γεννήσει, καὶ δώσω αὐ-
τὸν εἰς ἔθνος μέγα. Τὴν δὲ διαθήκην μου στήσω πρὸς Ἰσαάκ, 21
ὃν τέξεται σοι Σάρρα εἰς τὸν καιρὸν τοῦτον, ἐν τῷ ἐνιαυτῷ τῷ

**CHAPTER 17**

7 And kings shall come forth from thee.
And I will establish my covenant between Me and between thee, and between thy seed after thee throughout their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be thy God, and [the God] of thy seed after thee.
8 And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou sojournest, even all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.

9 And God said unto Abraham, "Thou shalt keep My covenant, thou and thy seed after thee, throughout their generations.
10 And this is the covenant which ye shall keep between Me and you, and between thy seed after thee throughout their generations: every male among you shall be circumcised.
11 And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin, and it shall be for a sign of the covenant between Me and you.
12 And a child of eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male throughout your generations: he that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.
13 Circumcised shall be circumcised the home-born of thy house, and he that is bought with money; and My covenant shall be upon your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
14 And the uncircumcised male, who shall not circumcise the flesh of his foreskin on the eighth day, that soul shall be utterly destroyed from among her kindred; for he hath broken My covenant."

15 And God said unto Abraham, "Sarra thy wife, her name shall not be called Sará; but Sarra shall be her name.
16 And I will bless her, and will give thee a child from her; yea, I will bless him, and he shall be [the father of] nations, and kings of nations shall come forth from him."
17 Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said within his heart, "Shall a son be born unto him that is an hundred years old? And shall Sarra, who is ninety years old, bear [a child]?"
18 And Abraham said unto God, "Oh that Ishmael might live before Thee!"

19 And God said unto Abraham, "Verily, behold, Sarra thy wife shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name Isaac; and I will establish My covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
20 And as for Ishmael, behold, I have heard thee; behold, I have blessed him, and I will increase him, and I will multiply him exceeding exceedingly; twelve nations shall he beget, and I will make him into a great nation.
21 But My covenant will I establish with Isaac, whom Sarra shall bear unto thee at this appointed time, in the next year."
