12 κατάξαι αὐτόν, καὶ ἐκβαλῶ αὐτόν (ἐκ τῆς γῆς). Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ Θεὸς πρὸς Βαλαάμ· οὐ πορεύσῃ μετ᾿ αὐτῶν, οὐδὲ καταράσῃ τὸν λαόν· ἔστι γὰρ εὐλογημένος.
13 Καὶ ἀναστὰς Βαλαὰμ τὸ πρωΐ, εἶπε τοῖς ἄρχουσι Βαλάκ· ἀποτρέχετε πρὸς τὸν κύριον ὑμῶν· οὐκ ἀφήσει με ὁ Θεὸς πορεύεσθαι μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν.
14 Καὶ ἀναστάντες οἱ ἄρχοντες Μωάβ, ἦλθον πρὸς Βαλάκ, καὶ εἶπον (αὐτῷ)· οὐ θέλει Βαλαὰμ πορευθῆναι μεθ᾿ ἡμῶν.
15 Καὶ προσέθετο ἔτι Βαλάκ ἀποστεῖλαι ἄρχοντας πλείους, καὶ ἐντιμοτέρους τούτων.
16 Καὶ ἦλθον πρὸς Βαλαάμ, καὶ λέγουσιν αὐτῷ· τάδε λέγει Βαλάκ ὁ τοῦ Σεπφώρ· ἀξιῶ σε, μὴ ὀκνήσῃς ἐλθεῖν πρὸς μέ·
17 ἐντίμως γὰρ τιμήσω σε σφόδρα, καὶ πάντα ὅσα ἐὰν εἴπῃς μοι, ποιήσω σοι· καὶ δεῦρο ἐπικαταράσαί μοι τὸν λαὸν τοῦτον.
18 Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη Βαλαάμ, καὶ εἶπε τοῖς ἄρχουσι Βαλάκ· ἐὰν δῷ μοι Βαλάκ πλήρη τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ ἀργυρίου ἢ χρυσίου, οὐ δυνήσομαι παραβῆναι τὸ ῥῆμα Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ, ποιῆσαι αὐτὸ μικρὸν ἢ μέγα ἐν τῇ διανοίᾳ μου·
19 καὶ νῦν ὑπομείνατε αὐτοῦ καὶ ὑμεῖς τὴν νύκτα ταύτην, καὶ γνώσομαι τί προσθήσει Κύριος λαλῆσαι πρὸς μέ.
20 Καὶ ἦλθεν ὁ Θεὸς πρὸς Βαλαὰμ νυκτός, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· εἰ καλέσαι σε πάρεισιν οἱ ἄνθρωποι οὗτοι, ἀναστὰς ἀκολούθησον αὐτοῖς· ἀλλὰ τὸ ῥῆμα ὃ ἐὰν λαλήσω πρὸς σέ, τοῦτο ποιήσεις.
21 Καὶ ἀναστὰς Βαλαὰμ τὸ πρωΐ, ἐπέσαξε τὴν ὄνον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπορεύθη μετὰ τῶν ἀνδρῶν Μωάβ.
22 Καὶ ὠργίσθη θυμῷ ὁ Θεός, ὅτι ἐπορεύετο αὐτός· καὶ ἀνέστη ὁ ἄγγελος τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ, ἐνδιαβάλλειν αὐτόν· καὶ αὐτὸς ἐπιβεβήκει ἐπὶ τῆς ὄνου αὐτοῦ, καὶ οἱ δύο παῖδες αὐτοῦ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ.
23 Καὶ ἰδοῦσα ἡ ὄνος τὸν ἄγγελον τοῦ Θεοῦ ἀνθεστηκότα ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ, καὶ τὴν ῥομφαίαν αὐτοῦ ἐσπασμένην ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐξέκλινεν ἡ ὄνος ἐκ τῆς ὁδοῦ, καὶ ἐπορεύετο εἰς τὸ πεδίον· καὶ ἐπάταξε Βαλαὰμ τὴν ὄνον ἐν τῇ ῥάβδῳ αὐτοῦ, τοῦ εὐθῦναι αὐτὴν ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ.
24 Καὶ ἔστη ὁ ἄγγελος τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐν ταῖς αὔλαξι τῶν ἀμπελώνων· φραγμὸς ἐντεῦθεν, καὶ φραγμὸς ἐντεῦθεν.
25 Καὶ ἰδοῦσα ἡ ὄνος τὸν ἄγγελον τοῦ Θεοῦ, προσέθλιψεν ἑαυτὴν πρὸς τὸν τοῖχον, καὶ ἀπέθλιψε τὸν πόδα Βαλαὰμ πρὸς τὸν τοῖχον· καὶ προσέθετο ἔτι μαστῖξαι αὐτήν.
26 Καὶ προσέθετο ὁ ἄγγελος τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ ἀπελθὼν ὑπέστη ἐν τόπῳ στενῷ, εἰς ὃν οὐκ ἦν ἐκκλῖναι δεξιὰν οὐδὲ ἀριστεράν.
27 Καὶ ἰδοῦσα ἡ ὄνος τὸν ἄγγελον τοῦ Θεοῦ, συνεκάθισεν ὑποκάτω Βαλαάμ· καὶ ἐθυμώθη ὀργῇ Βαλαάμ, καὶ ἔτυπτε

**Chapter 22**

12 [that I may] shatter him, and cast him out [from the earth].' And God said unto Balaam, 'Thou shalt not go with them, nor shalt thou curse the people; for he is blessed.'
13 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, 'Return ye unto your lord; for God suffereth me not to go with you.'
14 And the princes of Moab rose up, and came unto Balak, and said [unto him], 'Balaam will not go with us.'
15 And Balak added yet [to] send princes, more in number, and more honourable than these.
16 And they came unto Balaam, and said unto him, 'Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, "I pray thee, delay not to come unto me;
17 for I will honour thee exceedingly, and whatsoever thou shalt say unto me, I will do [it] for thee; and come now, curse me this people." '
18 And Balaam answered and said unto the princes of Balak, 'If Balak would give me his house full of silver or gold, I cannot transgress the word of the Lord God, to do it, whether small or great, in my mind;
19 and now, tarry ye also here this night, and I shall know what the Lord will yet speak unto me.'
20 And God came unto Balaam by night, and said unto him, 'If these men are come to call thee, rise up [and] follow them; but the word which I shall speak unto thee, that shalt thou do.'
21 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the men of Moab.
22 And God was wroth in anger, because he went; and the angel of God stood up in the way to hinder him; and he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.
23 And when the ass saw the angel of God standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand, then the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field; and Balaam smote the ass with his rod, to turn her back into the way.
24 And the angel of God stood in the furrows of the vineyards; a fence was on this side, and a fence on that side.
25 And when the ass saw the angel of God, she pressed herself against the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall; and he added yet to scourge her.
26 And the angel of God went further, and stood in a narrow place, where there was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.
27 And when the ass saw the angel of God, she lay down under Balaam; and Balaam was wroth with anger, and smote
