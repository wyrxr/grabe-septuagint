25 ῥίψα αὐτὰ εἰς τὸ πῦρ, καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ὁ μόσχος οὗτος. Καὶ ἰδὼν
         Μωυσῆς τὸν λαὸν ὅτι διεσκέδασται, (διεσκέδασε γὰρ αὐτοὺς ᾿Αα-
26 ρὼν ἐπίχαρμα τοῖς ὑπεναντίοις αὐτῶν), ἔστη δὲ Μωυσῆς ἐπὶ τῆς
         πύλης τῆς παρεμβολῆς, καὶ εἶπε· τίς πρὸς Κύριον; ἔτω πρός με.
27 Συνῆλθον οὖν πρὸς αὐτὸν πάντες οἱ υἱοὶ Λευί. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς·
         τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ᾿Ισραήλ· θέσθε ἕκαστος τὴν ῥομφαίαν
         ἑαυτοῦ ἐπὶ τὸν μηρόν, καὶ διέλθετε, καὶ ἀνακάμψατε ἀπὸ πύλης
         ἐπὶ πύλης διὰ τῆς παρεμβολῆς, καὶ ἀποκτείνατε ἕκαστος τὸν
         ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἕκαστος τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἕκαστος τὸν
28 ἐγγιστα αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐποίησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Λευί, καθὰ ἐλάλησεν αὐτοῖς
         Μωυσῆς· καὶ ἔπεσαν ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ εἰς τρισ-
29 χιλίους ἄνδρας. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς Μωυσῆς· ἐπληρώσατε τὰς χεῖ-
         ρας ὑμῶν σήμερον τῷ Κυρίῳ, ἕκαστος ἐν τῷ υἱῷ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐν
30 τῷ ἀδελφῷ αὐτοῦ, δοθῆναι ἐφ᾽ ὑμᾶς εὐλογίαν. Καὶ ἐγένετο μετὰ
         τὴν αὔριον, καὶ εἶπε Μωυσῆς πρὸς τὸν λαόν· ὑμεῖς ἡμαρτήκατε
         ἁμαρτίαν μεγάλην· καὶ νῦν ἀναβήσομαι πρὸς τὸν Θεόν, ἵνα ἐξιλά-
31 σωμαι περὶ τῆς ἁμαρτίας ὑμῶν. ᾿Επέστρεψε δὲ Μωυσῆς πρὸς Κύ-
32 ριον, καὶ εἶπε· δέομαι Κύριε, ἡμάρτηκεν ὁ λαὸς οὗτος ἁμαρτίαν
         μεγάλην, καὶ ἐποίησαν ἑαυτοῖς θεοὺς χρυσοῦς· καὶ νῦν εἰ μὲν
         ἀφεῖς αὐτοῖς τὴν ἁμαρτίαν αὐτῶν, ἄφες· εἰ δὲ μή, ἐξάλειψον κἀμὲ
33 ἐκ τῆς βίβλου σου, ἧς ἔγραψας. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν·
         εἴτις ἡμάρτηκεν ἐνώπιόν μου, ἐξαλείψω αὐτὸν ἐκ τῆς βίβλου μου.
34 Νυνὶ δὲ βάδιζε, καὶ ὁδήγησον τὸν λαὸν τοῦτον εἰς τὸν τόπον,
         ὃν εἶπά σοι· ἰδοὺ ὁ ἄγγελός μου προπορεύσεται πρὸ προσώπου σου·
         ᾗ δ᾽ ἂν ἡμέρα ἐπισκέπτωμαι, καὶ ἐπάξω ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς τὴν ἁμαρτίαν
35 αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐπάταξε Κύριος τὸν λαὸν περὶ τῆς ποιήσεως τοῦ μό-
         σχου, ὃν ἐποίησεν ᾿Ααρών.

1 ΚΑὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν· πορεύου, ἀνάβηθι ἐντεῦθεν σὺ
         καὶ ὁ λαός σου, οὓς ἐξήγαγες ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, εἰς τὴν γῆν ἣν
         ὤμοσα τῷ ᾿Αβραὰμ καὶ ᾿Ισαὰκ καὶ ᾿Ιακώβ, λέγων· τῷ σπέρμα-
2 τι ὑμῶν δώσω αὐτήν. Καὶ συναποστελῶ τὸν ἄγγελόν μου πρό-
         τερόν σου, καὶ ἐκβαλῶ τὸν Χαναναῖον, καὶ τὸν ᾿Αμορραῖον, καὶ

**EXODUS 32**

25 I cast them into the fire, and this calf came forth. And Moses, beholding the people, that they were scattered abroad, (for Aaron had scattered them, to be a disgrace unto their adversaries),
26 then stood Moses at the gate of the camp, and said, "Who is for the Lord? Let him come forth unto me."
27 And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves unto him. And he said unto them, "Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel: Put ye every man his sword upon his thigh, and pass through and return from gate unto gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his neighbor, and every man his nearest kinsman."
28 And the sons of Levi did according as Moses had spoken unto them; and there fell of the people in that day about three thousand men.
29 And Moses said unto them, "Ye have filled your hands unto the Lord this day, each man in [the matter of] his son and in [the matter of] his brother, that a blessing might be given upon you."
30 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, "Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto God, that I may make propitiation for your sin."
31 And Moses returned unto the Lord, and said, "I beseech thee, O Lord, this people hath sinned a great sin, and they have made for themselves gods of gold.
32 And now, if indeed Thou wilt forgive them their sin, forgive [it]; but if not, blot out me also from Thy book, which Thou hast written."
33 And the Lord said unto Moses, "Whosoever hath sinned before Me, him will I blot out from My book.
34 But now, go thou, and lead this people unto the place which I told thee; behold, My angel shall go before thy face. But in whatsoever day I visit, I will bring upon them their sin."
35 And the Lord smote the people concerning the making of the calf, which Aaron made.

**EXODUS 33**

1 AND the Lord said unto Moses, "Go forth, go up from hence, thou and thy people, whom thou hast brought out of the land of Egypt, unto the land which I swore unto Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, saying, 'Unto your seed will I give it.'
2 And I will send My angel along with thee before thee; and I will cast out the Canaanite, and the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Girgashite, and the Hivite,"
