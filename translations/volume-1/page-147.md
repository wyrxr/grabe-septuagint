22 ὁ Θεός. Εἶπε δὲ Κύριος πρὸς Μωσῆν· τάδε ἐρεῖς τῷ οἴκῳ Ἰακὼβ, καὶ ἀναγγελεῖς τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ· ὑμεῖς ἑωράκατε, ὅτι ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ λελάληκα πρὸς ὑμᾶς.
23 Οὐ ποιήσετε ἑαυτοῖς θεοὺς ἀργυροῦς, καὶ θεοὺς χρυσοῦς οὐ ποιήσετε ὑμῖν αὐτοῖς.
24 Θυσιαστήριον ἐκ γῆς ποιήσετέ μοι, καὶ θύσετε ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸ τὰ ὁλοκαυτώματα ὑμῶν, καὶ τὰ σωτήρια ὑμῶν, τὰ πρόβατα καὶ τοὺς μόσχους ὑμῶν ἐν παντὶ τόπῳ, οὗ ἐὰν ἐπονομάσω τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐκεῖ, καὶ ἥξω πρὸς σε, καὶ εὐλογήσω σε.
25 Ἐὰν δὲ θυσιαστήριον ἐκ λίθων ποιῆς μοι, οὐκ οἰκοδομήσεις αὐτοὺς τμητούς· τὸ γὰρ ἐγχειρίδιόν σου ἐπιβέβληκας ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸ, καὶ μεμίανται.
26 Οὐκ ἀναβήσῃ ἐν ἀναβαθμίσι ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριόν μου, ὅπως μὴ ἀποκαλύψῃς τὴν ἀσχημοσύνην σου ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῦ.

**ΚΕΦ. ΚΑ. ΧΧΙ.**

1 ΚΑΙ ταῦτα τὰ δικαιώματα, ἃ παραθήσεις ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν.
2 Ἐὰν κτήσῃ παῖδα Ἑβραῖον, ἓξ ἔτη δουλεύσει σοι· τῷ δὲ ἔτει τῷ ἑβδόμῳ ἐξαποστελεῖς αὐτὸν ἐλεύθερον δωρεάν.
3 Ἐὰν αὐτὸς μόνος εἰσέλθῃ, καὶ μόνος ἐξελεύσεται· ἐὰν δὲ γυνὴ συνεισέλθῃ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ ἐξελεύσεται μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ.
4 Ἐὰν δὲ ὁ κύριος δῷ αὐτῷ γυναῖκα, καὶ τέκνῃ αὐτῷ υἱοὺς ἢ θυγατέρας, ἡ γυνὴ καὶ τὰ παιδία ἔσται τῷ κυρίῳ αὐτοῦ, αὐτὸς δὲ μόνος ἐξελεύσεται.
5 Ἐὰν δὲ ἀποκριθεὶς εἴπῃ ὁ παῖς· ἠγάπηκα τὸν κύριόν μου, καὶ τὴν γυναῖκά μου, καὶ τὰ παιδία μου, οὐκ ἀποτρέχω ἐλεύθερος·
6 προσάξει αὐτὸν ὁ κύριος αὐτοῦ πρὸς τὸ κριτήριον τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ τότε προσάξει αὐτὸν πρὸς τὴν θύραν ἐπὶ τὸν σταθμὸν, καὶ τρυπήσει αὐτοῦ ὁ κύριος τὸ οὖς τῷ ὀπητίῳ, καὶ δουλεύσει αὐτῷ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα.
7 Ἐὰν δέ τις ἀποδῶται τὴν ἑαυτοῦ θυγατέρα οἰκέτιν, οὐκ ἀπελεύσεται ὥσπερ ἀποτρέχουσιν αἱ δοῦλαι.
8 Ἐὰν δὲ μὴ εὐαρεστήσῃ τῷ κυρίῳ αὐτῆς, ἣν οὐ καθωμολογήσατο αὐτὴν, ἀπολυτρώσει αὐτήν· ἔθνει δὲ ἀλλοτρίῳ οὐ κύριός ἐστι πωλεῖν αὐτὴν, ὅτι ἠθέτησεν ἐν αὐτῇ.
9 Ἐὰν δὲ τῷ υἱῷ καθωμολογήσηται αὐτὴν, κατὰ τὸ δικαίωμα τῶν θυγατέρων ποιήσει αὐτῇ.
10 Ἐὰν δὲ ἄλλην λάβῃ αὐτῷ, τὰ δέοντα καὶ τὸν ἱματισμὸν καὶ τὴν ὁμιλίαν αὐτῆς οὐκ ἀποστερήσει.
11 Ἐὰν δὲ τὰ τρία ταῦτα μὴ ποιήσῃ αὐτῇ, ἐξελεύσεται δωρεὰν ἄνευ ἀργυρίου.
12 Ἐὰν δὲ πατάξῃ τις τινὰ, καὶ ἀποθάνῃ, θανάτῳ θανατούσθω.
13 Ὁ δὲ οὐχ ἑκὼν, ἀλλ᾿ ὁ Θεὸς παρέδωκεν αὐτὸν εἰς τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ...

### Exodus, Chapter Twenty

22 The Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, "Thus shalt thou speak unto the house of Jacob, and thou shalt declare unto the sons of Israel: Ye have yourselves beheld that from heaven have I spoken unto you.
23 Ye shall not make unto yourselves gods of silver, nor shall ye fashion unto yourselves gods of gold.
24 An altar of earth shalt thou make unto Me, and upon it thou shalt sacrifice thy whole burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep and thine oxen, in every place where I shall cause My Name to be named; and I shall come unto thee, and I shall bless thee.
25 And if an altar of stones thou wilt make unto Me, thou shalt not build them of hewn stone; for if thou hast lifted thy tool upon it, it is defiled.
26 Neither shalt thou ascend by steps unto Mine altar, that thou mayest not uncover thy shame upon it."

### Exodus, Chapter Twenty-One

1 Now these are the ordinances which thou shalt set before them.
2 If thou acquire a Hebrew bondman, six years shall he serve thee; but in the seventh year thou shalt send him forth free, without cost.
3 If he came in by himself, then by himself shall he go forth; but if a wife came in with him, then his wife also shall go forth with him.
4 And if his master give him a wife, and she bear him sons or daughters, the wife and the children shall be his master's, but he himself alone shall go forth.
5 But if the bondman shall answer and say, "I love my master, and my wife, and my children; I will not go forth free,"
6 then his master shall bring him unto the judgment-seat of God; and thereafter shall he bring him unto the door, against the doorpost; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever.
7 And if a man sell his daughter for a bondwoman, she shall not go forth as the bondwomen do depart.
8 And if she please not her master, whom he hath not espoused her unto himself, then shall he redeem her; but he shall have no power to sell her unto a foreign nation, because he hath dealt faithlessly with her.
9 And if he shall designate her unto his son, according to the ordinance of daughters shall he deal with her.
10 If he take another wife for himself, her food and her raiment and her conjugal fellowship shall he not diminish.
11 But if these three things he do not unto her, then shall she go forth free, without money.
12 If a man strike anyone, and he die, he shall surely be put to death.
13 But if he did not [do it] willingly, but God hath delivered him [the victim] into his hands...
