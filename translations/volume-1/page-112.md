πεν· ὅταν μαιοῦσθε τὰς Ἑβραίας, καὶ ὦσι πρὸς τὸ τίκτειν, ἐὰν
μὲν ἄρσεν ᾖ, ἀποκτείνετε αὐτό· ἐὰν δὲ θῆλυ, περιποιεῖσθε αὐτό.
Ἐφοβήθησαν δὲ αἱ μαῖαι τὸν Θεόν, καὶ οὐκ ἐποίησαν καθότι συ- 17
νέταξεν αὐταῖς ὁ βασιλεὺς Αἰγύπτου, καὶ ἐζωογόνουν τὰ ἄρσενα.
Ἐκάλεσε δὲ ὁ βασιλεὺς Αἰγύπτου τὰς μαίας, καὶ εἶπεν αὐταῖς· 18
τί ἔτι ἐποιήσατε τὸ πρᾶγμα τοῦτο, καὶ ἐζωογονεῖτε τὰ ἄρσενα;
Εἶπαν δὲ αἱ μαῖαι τῷ Φαραώ· οὐχ ὡς γυναῖκες Αἰγύπτου, αἱ 19
Ἑβραῖαι· τίκτουσι γὰρ πρὶν ἢ εἰσελθεῖν πρὸς αὐτὰς τὰς μαίας,
καὶ ἔτικτον. Εὖ δὲ ἐποίει ὁ Θεὸς ταῖς μαίαις· καὶ ἐπλήθυνεν ὁ 20
λαός, καὶ ἴσχυε σφόδρα. Ἐπεὶ δὲ ἐφοβοῦντο αἱ μαῖαι τὸν Θεόν, 21
ἐποίησαν ἑαυταῖς οἰκίας. Συνέταξε δὲ Φαραὼ παντὶ τῷ λαῷ αὐτοῦ, 22
λέγων· πᾶν ἄρσεν ὃ ἐὰν τεχθῇ τοῖς Ἑβραίοις, εἰς τὸν ποταμὸν
ῥίψατε, καὶ πᾶν θῆλυ ζωογονεῖτε αὐτό.

ΗΝ δέ τις ἐκ τῆς φυλῆς Λευΐ, ὃς ἔλαβε τῶν θυγατέρων Λευΐ, 1
καὶ ἔσχεν αὐτήν· καὶ ἐν γαστρὶ ἔλαβε, καὶ ἔτεκεν ἄρσεν. Ἰδόντες 2
δὲ αὐτὸ ἀστεῖον ὄν, ἐσκέπασαν αὐτὸ μῆνας τρεῖς. Ἐπειδὴ δὲ οὐκ 3
ἐδύναντο ἔτι κρύπτειν αὐτό, ἔλαβεν ἡ μήτηρ αὐτῷ θῖβιν, καὶ κατέ-
χρισεν αὐτὴν ἀσφαλτοπίσσῃ, καὶ ἐνέβαλε τὸ παιδίον εἰς αὐτήν, καὶ
ἔθηκεν αὐτὴν εἰς τὸ ἕλος παρὰ τὸν ποταμόν. Καὶ κατεσκόπευεν 4
ἡ ἀδελφὴ αὐτοῦ μακρόθεν, μαθεῖν τὸ ἀποβησόμενον αὐτῷ. Κατέ- 5
βη δὲ ἡ θυγάτηρ Φαραὼ λούσασθαι ἐπὶ τὸν ποταμόν, καὶ αἱ
ἄβραι αὐτῆς παρεπορεύοντο ἐπὶ τὸν ποταμόν· καὶ ἰδοῦσα τὴν θῖβιν
ἐν τῷ ἕλει, ἀποστείλασα τὴν ἄβραν, ἀνείλατο αὐτήν. Ἀνοίξασα 6
δέ, ὁρᾷ παιδίον κλαῖον ἐν τῇ θίβει· καὶ ἐφείσατο αὐτοῦ ἡ θυγάτηρ
Φαραώ, καὶ ἔφη· ἀπὸ τῶν παιδίων τῶν Ἑβραίων τοῦτο. Καὶ εἶ- 7
πεν ἡ ἀδελφὴ αὐτοῦ τῇ θυγατρὶ Φαραώ· θέλεις καλέσω σοι γυ-
ναῖκα τροφεύουσαν ἐκ τῶν Ἑβραίων, καὶ θηλάσει σοι τὸ παιδίον;
Ἡ δὲ εἶπεν αὐτῇ ἡ θυγάτηρ Φαραώ· πορεύου. Ἐλθοῦσα δὲ ἡ νεᾶ- 8
νις, ἐκάλεσε τὴν μητέρα τοῦ παιδίου. Εἶπε δὲ πρὸς αὐτὴν ἡ θυ- 9
γάτηρ Φαραώ· διατήρησόν μοι τὸ παιδίον τοῦτο, καὶ θήλασόν μοι
αὐτό· ἐγὼ δὲ δώσω σοι τὸν μισθόν. Ἔλαβε δὲ ἡ γυνὴ τὸ παι-
δίον, καὶ ἐθήλαζεν αὐτό. Ἀδρυνθέντος δὲ τοῦ παιδίου, εἰσήγαγεν 10

**Chapter 1**

16 whose name was Sepphora, and the name of the second, Phua.) And he said:
"When ye assist the Hebrew women in childbirth, and they are about to bear,
if it be a male child, ye shall kill it; but if it be a female, ye shall preserve it alive."
17 But the midwives feared God, and wrought not according to that which
the king of Egypt commanded them, but preserved the male children alive.
18 Then the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them,
"Why have ye done this thing, and preserved the male children alive?"
19 And the midwives answered Pharaoh, "The Hebrew women are not as the women
of Egypt; for they are delivered ere the midwives come unto them, and they bear children."
20 And God dealt well with the midwives; and the people multiplied, and waxed exceeding strong.
21 And because the midwives feared God, He established for them households.
22 Then Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, "Every male child
that is born unto the Hebrews, ye shall cast into the river;
but every female child, ye shall preserve alive."

**Chapter 2**

1 Now there was a man of the tribe of Levi, who took [a wife]
from among the daughters of Levi, and had her; and she conceived in her womb,
and bore a male child.
2 And when they saw that he was beautiful, they hid him three months.
3 But when they could no longer hide him, his mother took for him an ark of papyrus,
and daubed it with bitumen and pitch, and she put the child therein,
and laid it in the reeds by the river's bank.
4 And his sister stood afar off, to know what would become of him.
5 And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river,
and her maidens walked along by the river's side;
and when she saw the ark among the reeds, she sent her maiden to fetch it.
6 And when she had opened it, she saw the child, and behold,
the infant wept in the ark; and Pharaoh's daughter had compassion on him,
and said, "This is one of the children of the Hebrews."
7 Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, "Wilt thou that I call to thee
a nurse from among the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?"
8 And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, "Go."
And the maiden went and called the child's mother.
9 And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, "Take this child and nurse it for me,
and I will give thee thy wages." And the woman took the child, and nursed it.
10 And when the child was grown, she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter;
