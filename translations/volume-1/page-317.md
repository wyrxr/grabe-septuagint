ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν ἐπὶ πηγάς, καὶ καταβήσεται τὰ ὅρια Βηλὰ, καὶ
12 συγκρούσει ἐπὶ νώτου θαλάσσης Χενερὲθ ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν· καὶ κα-
ταβήσεται τὰ ὅρια ἐπὶ τὸν Ἰορδάνην, καὶ ἔσται ἡ διέξοδος αὐτοῦ
θάλασσα ἡ ἁλυκή· αὕτη ἔσται ὑμῖν ἡ γῆ καὶ τὰ ὅρια αὐτῆς κύκλῳ.
13 Καὶ ἐνετείλατο Μωυσῆς τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ, λέγων· αὕτη ἡ γῆ ἣν
κατακληρονομήσετε αὐτὴν μετὰ κλήρου, ὃν τρόπον συνέταξε Κύ-
ριος δοῦναι αὐτὴν ταῖς ἐννέα φυλαῖς, καὶ τῷ ἡμίσει φυλῆς Μα-
14 νασσῆ· ὅτι ἔλαβε φυλὴ υἱῶν Ῥουβὴν κατ᾿ οἴκους πατριῶν αὐτῶν,
καὶ φυλὴ υἱῶν Γὰδ κατ᾿ οἴκους πατριῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ τὸ ἥμισυ φυ-
15 λῆς Μανασσῆ ἀπέλαβον τοὺς κλήρους αὐτῶν· δύο φυλαὶ καὶ ἥμι-
συ φυλῆς ἔλαβον τοὺς κλήρους αὐτῶν πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου κατὰ
16 Ἱεριχὼ ἀπὸ νότου πρὸς ἀνατολάς. Καὶ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μω-
17υσῆν, λέγων· ταῦτα τὰ ὀνόματα τῶν ἀνδρῶν οἱ κληρονομήσουσι
18 ὑμῖν τὴν γῆν· Ἐλεάζαρ ὁ ἱερεὺς καὶ Ἰησοῦς υἱὸς Ναυῆ. Καὶ
ἄρχοντα ἕνα ἄρχοντα ἕνα ἐκ φυλῆς λήψεσθε κατακληρονομῆσαι
19 ὑμῖν τὴν γῆν. Καὶ ταῦτα τὰ ὀνόματα τῶν ἀνδρῶν· τῆς φυλῆς
20 Ἰούδα, Χάλεβ υἱὸς Ἰεφοννῆ· τῆς φυλῆς υἱῶν Συμεών, Σαλαμιὴλ
21 υἱὸς Ἐμιούδ· τῆς φυλῆς Βενιαμείν, Ἐλδάδ υἱὸς Χασλών· 22 τῆς
23 φυλῆς υἱῶν Δάν, ἄρχων Βοκχὶ υἱὸς Ἐγλί· τῶν υἱῶν Ἰωσήφ, φυ-
24 λῆς υἱῶν Μανασσῆ, ἄρχων Ἀνιὴλ υἱὸς Οὐφίδ· τῆς φυλῆς υἱῶν Ἐφ-
25ραίμ, ἄρχων Καμουὴλ υἱὸς Σαβαθάν· τῆς φυλῆς υἱῶν Ζαβουλών,
26 ἄρχων Ἐλισαφὰν υἱὸς Φαρνάχ· τῆς φυλῆς υἱῶν Ἰσσάχαρ, ἄρ-
27χων Φαλτιὴλ υἱὸς Ὀζᾶ· τῆς φυλῆς υἱῶν Ἀσήρ, ἄρχων Ἀχι-

NUMBERS CHAPTER XXXIV. XXXV.

12 from the east to the springs; and the border shall descend unto Belah, and it shall impinge upon the back of the Sea of Chinnereth from the east; and the border shall descend unto the Jordan, and its outlet shall be the Salt Sea. This shall be the land for you, and its borders all around.

13 And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is the land which ye shall inherit by lot, in the manner the Lord hath commanded to give it unto the nine tribes, and to the half tribe of Manasseh.

14 For the tribe of the children of Reuben hath received according to the houses of their fathers, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to the houses of their fathers, and the half tribe of

15 Manasseh have received their inheritances; two tribes and half a tribe have received their inheritances beyond the Jordan, over against Jericho, from the south toward the east.

16 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

17 These are the names of the men who shall inherit unto you the land:

18 Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun. And a ruler, a ruler from [each] tribe shall ye take to inherit

19 unto you the land. And these are the names of the men: of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh;

20 of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shelemiah the son of Ammihud;

21 of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon;

22 of the tribe of the children of Dan, the ruler Bukki the son of Egli;

23 of the children of Joseph, of the tribe of the children of Manasseh, the ruler Haniel the son of Ephod;

24 of the tribe of the children of Ephraim, the ruler Kemuel the son of Shiphtan;

25 of the tribe of the children of Zebulun, the ruler Elizaphan the son of Parnach;

26 of the tribe of the children of Issachar, the ruler Paltiel the son of Azzan;

27 of the tribe of the children of Asher, the ruler Ahihud the son of Shelomi;

28 of the tribe of Naphtali, the ruler Pedahel the son of Ammihud.

29 These are they whom the Lord commanded to divide [the inheritance] unto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.

### CHAPTER XXXV.

1 And the Lord spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan, over against Jericho, saying,

2 Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the Levites, from the inheritances of their possession, cities wherein to dwell; and the suburbs of the cities round about them shall they give

3 unto the Levites. And the cities shall be for them to dwell in, and their allotted boundaries shall be for their cattle, and for their possessions, and for all their beasts.

4 And the lands surrounding the
