### Deuteronomy Chapter 3

**Original Text:**
314 ΔΕΥΤΕΡΟΝΟΜΙΟΝ ΚΕΦ. Γ΄. Δ΄.
19 δυνατός· πλὴν αἱ γυναῖκες ὑμῶν καὶ τὰ τέκνα ὑμῶν καὶ τὰ κτήνη ὑμῶν, (οἶδα ὅτι πολλὰ τὰ κτήνη ὑμῖν,) κατοικείτωσαν ἐν ταῖς
20 πόλεσιν ὑμῶν, αἷς ἔδωκα ὑμῖν· ἕως ἂν καταπαύσῃ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς ὑμῶν, ὥσπερ καὶ ὑμᾶς, καὶ κατακληρονομήσουσι καὶ οὗτοι τὴν γῆν, ἣν Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν δίδωσιν αὐτοῖς ἐν τῷ πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου· καὶ ἐπαναστραφήσεσθε ἕκαστος εἰς τὴν
21 κληρονομίαν αὐτοῦ, ἣν ἔδωκα ὑμῖν. Καὶ τῷ Ἰησοῦ ἐνετειλάμην ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ, λέγων· οἱ ὀφθαλμοί ὑμῶν ἑωράκασι πάντα, ὅσα ἐποίησε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν τοῖς δυσὶ βασιλεῦσι τούτοις, οὕτω ποιήσει Κύριος (ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν) πάσας τὰς βασιλείας ἐφ᾿
22 ἃς σὺ διαβαίνεις ἐκεῖ. Οὐ φοβηθήσεσθε ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν, ὅτι Κύριος ὁ
23 Θεὸς ὑμῶν αὐτὸς πολεμήσει περὶ ὑμῶν. Καὶ ἐδεήθην Κυρίου ἐν
24 τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ, λέγων· Κύριε Κύριε, σὺ ἤρξαι δεῖξαι τῷ σῷ θεράποντι τὴν ἰσχύν σου, καὶ τὴν δύναμίν σου, καὶ τὴν χεῖρα τὴν κραταιάν, καὶ τὸν βραχίονα τὸν ὑψηλόν· τίς γὰρ Θεὸς ἐν οὐρανῷ ἢ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, ὅστις ποιήσει καθὰ ἐποίησας σύ, καὶ κατὰ
25 τὴν ἰσχύν σου; Διαβὰς οὖν ὄψομαι τὴν γῆν τὴν ἀγαθὴν ταύτην τὴν οὖσαν πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου, τὸ ὄρος τοῦτο τὸ ἀγαθόν, καὶ τὸν Ἀντιλίβανον.
26 Καὶ ὑπερεῖδε Κύριος ἐμὲ ἕνεκεν ὑμῶν, καὶ οὐκ εἰσήκουσε μου, καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρός με· ἱκανούσθω σοι, μὴ προσθῇς ἔτι λαλῆσαι πρός με τὸν λόγον τοῦτον.
27 Ἀνάβηθι ἐπὶ κορυφὴν τοῦ λελαξευμένου, καὶ ἀνάβλεψον τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς σου κατὰ θάλασσαν καὶ βορρᾶν καὶ νότον καὶ ἀνατολάς, καὶ ἴδε τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς σου·
28 ὅτι οὐ διαβήσῃ τὸν Ἰορδάνην τοῦτον. Καὶ ἔντειλαι Ἰησοῖ, καὶ ἐνίσχυσον αὐτόν, καὶ παρακάλεσον αὐτόν· ὅτι οὗτος διαθήσεται πρὸ προσώπου τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου, καὶ αὐτὸς κατακληρονομήσει αὐτοῖς τὴν γῆν ἣν ἑώρακας.
29 Καὶ ἐνεκαθήμεθα ἐν νάπῃ σύνεγγυς οἴκου Φογώρ.

1 ΚΑΙ νῦν Ἰσραὴλ ἄκουε τῶν δικαιωμάτων καὶ τῶν κριμάτων, ὅσα ἐγὼ διδάσκω ὑμᾶς σήμερον ποιεῖν, ἵνα ζῆτε καὶ εἰσελθόντες κληρονομήσητε τὴν γῆν, ἣν Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τῶν πατέρων ὑμῶν
2 δίδωσιν ὑμῖν. Οὐ προσθήσετε πρὸς τὸ ῥῆμα ὃ ἐγὼ ἐντέλλομαι ὑμῖν, καὶ οὐκ ἀφελεῖτε ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ, φυλάσσεσθαι τὰς ἐντολὰς Κυρίου.

### Deuteronomy Chapter 3

19 But your wives and your children and your livestock— (for I know that your livestock are many)—let them dwell in your cities,
20 which I have given you, until the Lord your God gives rest unto your brethren, even as He has given unto you. And they also shall inherit the land which the Lord your God gives unto them beyond the Jordan. Then shall ye turn back, every man, unto his own
21 inheritance which I have given you. And unto Joshua I gave charge at that time, saying: Thine eyes have seen all that the Lord your God did unto these two kings; so shall the Lord (our God) do unto all the kingdoms
22 over which thou shalt pass there. Ye shall not fear them, for the Lord
23 your God, He Himself, shall fight for you. And I besought the Lord at
24 that time, saying: O Lord, O Lord, Thou hast begun to show unto Thy servant Thy strength, and Thy power, and Thy mighty hand, and Thy high arm. For what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do as Thou hast done, and according to
25 Thy strength? Therefore, having crossed over, I shall see this goodly land that lies beyond the Jordan, even this good mountain, and the Anti-Lebanon.
26 Yet the Lord disregarded me for your sakes, and He heard me not; and the Lord said unto me: Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto Me concerning this matter.
27 Get thee up unto the top of the hewn [rock], and lift up thine eyes towards the sea and the north and the south and the east, and behold with thine eyes,
28 for thou shalt not cross over this Jordan. And give charge unto Joshua, and strengthen him, and encourage him; for he shall dispose [of it] before the face of this people, and he himself shall cause them to inherit the land which thou hast seen.
29 And we abode in a ravine near the house of Peor.

### Deuteronomy Chapter 4

1 And now, O Israel, hearken unto the statutes and unto the judgments which I teach you this day, that ye may live and, having entered in, may inherit the land which the Lord, the God of your fathers,
2 gives unto you. Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord.
