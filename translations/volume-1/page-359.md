ΚΕΦ. ΙΘ΄. ΧΙΧ.

1 ἙΑΝ δὲ ἀφανίσῃ Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου τὰ ἔθνη, ἃ Κύριος ὁ
Θεός σου δίδωσί σοι τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν, καὶ κατακληρονομήσῃς αὐ–
τοὺς, καὶ κατοικήσῃς ἐν ταῖς πόλεσιν αὐτῶν καὶ ἐν τοῖς οἴκοις
2 αὐτῶν, τρεῖς πόλεις διαστελεῖς σεαυτῷ ἐν μέσῳ τῆς γῆς σου,
3 ἧς Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου δίδωσί σοι τοῦ κληρονομῆσαι αὐτήν· στόχασαι
σοι τὴν ὁδὸν, καὶ τριμεριεῖς τὰ ὅρια τῆς γῆς σου, ἣν καταμερίζει
σοι Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου· καὶ ἔσται καταφυγὴ ἐκεῖ παντὶ
4 τῷ φονευτῇ. Τοῦτο δὲ ἔσται τὸ πρόσταγμα τοῦ φονευτοῦ, ὃς ἂν
φύγῃ ἐκεῖ, καὶ ζήσεται· ὃς ἂν πατάξῃ τὸν πλησίον αὑτοῦ ἀκουσίως,
καὶ οὗτος οὐ μισῶν αὐτὸν πρὸ τῆς ἐχθὲς καὶ πρὸ τῆς τρίτης·
5 καὶ ὃς ἂν εἰσέλθῃ μετὰ τοῦ πλησίον αὑτοῦ εἰς τὸν δρυμὸν,
συναγαγεῖν ξύλα, καὶ ἐκκρούσῃ ἡ χεὶρ αὑτοῦ τῇ ἀξίνῃ κόπτοντος
τὸ ξύλον, καὶ ἐκπεσὸν τὸ σιδήριον ἀπὸ τοῦ ξύλου, τύχῃ τοῦ πλησίον,
καὶ ἀποθάνῃ· οὗτος καταφεύξεται εἰς μίαν τῶν πόλεων τούτων,
6 καὶ ζήσεται· ἵνα μὴ διώξας ὁ ἀγχιστεύων τοῦ αἵματος ὀπίσω τοῦ
φονεύσαντος, ὅτι παρατεθέρμανται τῇ καρδίᾳ αὑτοῦ, καὶ καταλάβῃ
αὐτὸν, ἐὰν μακροτέρα ᾖ ἡ ὁδὸς, καὶ πατάξῃ αὑτοῦ τὴν ψυχὴν,
καὶ ἀποθάνῃ· καὶ τοῦτο οὐκ ἔστι κρίσις θανάτου, ὅτι οὐ μισῶν
7 ἦν αὐτὸν πρὸ τῆς ἐχθὲς καὶ πρὸ τῆς τρίτης. Διὰ τοῦτο ἐγώ σοι
ἐντέλλομαι τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο, λέγων· τρεῖς πόλεις διαστελεῖς σεαυτῷ.
8 Ἐὰν δὲ ἐμπλατύνῃ Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου τὰ ὅριά σου, ὃν τρόπον
ὤμοσε τοῖς πατράσι σου, καὶ δῷ σοι Κύριος πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν,
9 ἣν εἶπε δοῦναι τοῖς πατράσι σου, (ἐὰν εἰσακούσῃ ποιεῖν πάσας τὰς
ἐντολὰς ταύτας, ἃς ἐγὼ ἐντέλλομαί σοι σήμερον, ἀγαπᾶν Κύριον
τὸν Θεόν σου, πορεύεσθαι ἐν πάσαις ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὐτοῦ πάσας τὰς
ἡμέρας,) καὶ προσθήσεις σεαυτῷ ἔτι τρεῖς πόλεις πρὸς τὰς τρεῖς
10 (πόλεις) ταύτας· καὶ οὐκ ἐκχυθήσεται αἷμα ἀναίτιον ἐν τῇ γῇ σου,
ἣν Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου δίδωσί σοι ἐν κλήρῳ, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ἐν σοὶ
11 αἵματι ἔνοχος. Ἐὰν δὲ γένηται ἄνθρωπος μισῶν τὸν πλησίον αὑτοῦ,
καὶ ἐνεδρεύσῃ αὐτὸν, καὶ ἐπαναστῇ ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν, καὶ πατάξῃ αὑτοῦ
12 ψυχὴν, καὶ ἀποθάνῃ, καὶ φύγῃ εἰς μίαν τῶν πόλεων τούτων, καὶ
ἀποστελοῦσιν ἡ γερουσία τῆς πόλεως αὐτοῦ, καὶ λήψονται αὐτὸν
ἐκεῖθεν, καὶ παραδώσουσιν αὐτὸν εἰς χεῖρας τῷ ἀγχιστεύοντι τοῦ

**DEUTERONOMY**
**CHAPTER XIX.**

1 When the Lord thy God shall utterly destroy the nations, whose land the Lord thy God giveth unto thee, and thou shalt possess them, and dwell in their cities, and in their houses;
2 Then three cities shalt thou set apart for thyself in the midst of thy land,
3 Which the Lord thy God giveth unto thee to inherit it. Thou shalt prepare for thyself the way, and shalt make three divisions of the borders of thy land, which the Lord thy God divideth unto thee; and there shall be a refuge there for every slayer.
4 And this shall be the ordinance for the slayer, who fleeth thither, and shall live: Whosoever smiteth his neighbour unawares, and this one hated him not aforetime, neither the day before;
5 As when a man goeth with his neighbour into the forest to gather wood, and his hand striketh with the axe to hew the wood, and the iron falleth from the wood and lighteth upon his neighbour, and he dieth; he shall flee unto one of these cities, and shall live.
6 Lest the avenger of blood pursue after the slayer—because his heart hath been greatly inflamed—and overtake him, if the way be too long, and smite his soul, and he die; for this is not a judgment of death, because he hated him not aforetime, neither the day before.
7 Therefore I command thee this word, saying: Three cities shalt thou set apart for thyself.
8 And if the Lord thy God shall enlarge thy borders, in the manner as He swore unto thy fathers, and the Lord give thee all the land,
9 Which He promised to give unto thy fathers, (if thou hearken to do all these commandments, which I command thee this day, to love the Lord thy God, [and] to walk in all His ways all the days,) then shalt thou add unto thyself yet three cities unto these three (cities);
10 And innocent blood shall not be shed in thy land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and thou shalt not be found guilty of blood therein.
11 But if there be a man who hateth his neighbour, and lieth in wait for him, and riseth up against him, and smiteth his soul,
12 And he dieth, and fleeth into one of these cities, then the elders of his city shall send, and shall fetch him from thence, and shall deliver him into the hands of the avenger of blood.
