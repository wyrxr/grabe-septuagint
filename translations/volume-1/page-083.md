23 χειρῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἀποδῷ αὐτὸν τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ. Ἐγένετο δὲ
    ἡνίκα ἦλθεν Ἰωσὴφ πρὸς τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ, ἐξέδυσαν τὸν Ἰω-
24 σὴφ τὸν χιτῶνα αὐτοῦ τὸν ποικίλον τὸν περὶ αὐτόν· καὶ λαβόν-
    τες αὐτόν, ἔῤῥιψαν αὐτὸν εἰς τὸν λάκκον· ὁ δὲ λάκκος κενός,
25 ὕδωρ οὐκ εἶχεν. Ἐκάθισαν δὲ φαγεῖν ἄρτον, καὶ ἀναβλέψαντες
    τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς ἴδον· καὶ ἰδοὺ ὁδοιπόροι Ἰσμαηλῖται ἤρχοντο ἐκ
    Γαλαάδ, καὶ αἱ κάμηλοι αὐτῶν ἔγεμον θυμιαμάτων καὶ ῥητίνης
26 καὶ στακτῆς· ἐπορεύοντο δὲ καταγαγεῖν εἰς Αἴγυπτον. Εἶπε δὲ Ἰού-
    δας πρὸς τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ· τί χρήσιμον, ἐὰν ἀποκτείνωμεν
27 τὸν ἀδελφὸν ἡμῶν, καὶ κρύψωμεν τὸ αἷμα αὐτοῦ; δεῦτε, ἀπο-
    δώμεθα αὐτὸν τοῖς Ἰσμαηλίταις τούτοις· αἱ δὲ χεῖρες ἡμῶν μὴ
    ἔστωσαν ἐπ᾿ αὐτόν, ὅτι ἀδελφὸς ἡμῶν καὶ σάρξ ἡμῶν ἐστιν. Ἤ-
28 κουσαν δὲ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ παρεπορεύοντο οἱ ἄνθρωποι οἱ
    Μαδιηναῖοι οἱ ἔμποροι· καὶ ἐξείλκυσαν καὶ ἀνεβίβασαν τὸν Ἰω-
    σὴφ ἐκ τοῦ λάκκου, καὶ ἀπέδοντο τὸν Ἰωσὴφ τοῖς Ἰσμαηλίταις
29 εἴκοσι χρυσῶν· καὶ κατήγαγον τὸν Ἰωσὴφ εἰς Αἴγυπτον. Ἀνέ-
    στρεψε δὲ Ῥουβὴν ἐπὶ τὸν λάκκον, καὶ οὐχ ὁρᾷ τὸν Ἰωσὴφ ἐν
30 τῷ λάκκῳ· καὶ διέῤῥηξε τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἀνέστρεψε πρὸς
    τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπε· τὸ παιδάριον οὐκ ἔστιν, ἐγὼ δὲ
31 ποῦ πορεύσομαι ἔτι; Λαβόντες δὲ τὸν χιτῶνα τοῦ Ἰωσήφ, ἔσφα-
32 ξαν ἔριφον αἰγῶν, καὶ ἐμόλυναν τὸν χιτῶνα αἵματι. Καὶ ἀπέ-
    στειλαν τὸν χιτῶνα τὸν ποικίλον, καὶ εἰσήνεγκαν τῷ πατρὶ αὐτῶν,
    καὶ εἶπαν· τοῦτον εὕρομεν, ἐπίγνωθι εἰ χιτὼν τοῦ υἱοῦ σου ἐστίν,
33 ἢ οὐ. Καὶ ἐπέγνω αὐτόν, καὶ εἶπε· χιτὼν τοῦ υἱοῦ μου ἐστί.
34 θηρίον πονηρὸν κατέφαγεν αὐτόν, θηρίον ἥρπασε τὸν Ἰωσήφ. Διέρ-
    ρηξε δὲ Ἰακὼβ τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπέθετο σάκκον ἐπὶ τὴν
35 ὀσφῦν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπένθει τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ ἡμέρας πολλὰς. Συνήχ-
    θησαν δὲ πάντες οἱ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ αἱ θυγατέρες αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἦλ-
    θον παρακαλέσαι αὐτόν· καὶ οὐκ ἤθελε παρακαλεσθαι, λέγων, ὅτι
    καταβήσομαι πρὸς τὸν υἱόν μου πενθῶν εἰς ᾅδου· καὶ ἔκλαυσεν
36 αὐτὸν ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ. Οἱ δὲ Μαδιηναῖοι ἀπέδοντο τὸν Ἰωσὴφ εἰς
    Αἴγυπτον τῷ Πετεφρῆ τῷ σπάδοντι Φαραώ, ἀρχιμαγείρῳ.

<div class="verse-num">23</div> Now it came to pass, when Joseph drew nigh unto his brethren,
they stripped Joseph of his coat, the variegated garment that was upon him.
<div class="verse-num">24</div> And taking him, they cast him into the pit;
and the pit was empty, no water did it hold.
<div class="verse-num">25</div> And they sat down to eat bread;
and lifting up their eyes, they did behold:
and lo, wayfaring Ishmaelites were coming from Gilead,
and their camels were laden with incense and resin and stacte;
and they journeyed to bring [them] down into Egypt.
<div class="verse-num">26</div> Then said Judah unto his brethren,
What profit [is it], if we slay our brother, and hide his blood?
<div class="verse-num">27</div> Come, let us sell him to these Ishmaelites;
and let not our hands be upon him,
for he is our brother and our flesh.
And his brethren hearkened.
<div class="verse-num">28</div> And there passed by Midianite men, merchants;
and they drew forth and brought Joseph up out of the pit,
and sold Joseph unto the Ishmaelites for twenty [pieces] of gold;
and they brought Joseph down into Egypt.
<div class="verse-num">29</div> And Reuben returned unto the pit,
and he saw not Joseph in the pit;
<div class="verse-num">30</div> and he rent his garments.
And he returned unto his brethren, and said,
The lad is not [there]; and I, whither shall I go now?
<div class="verse-num">31</div> And they took Joseph’s coat,
and slew a kid of the goats,
and stained the coat with blood.
<div class="verse-num">32</div> And they sent the variegated coat,
and brought it to their father, and said,
This have we found; discern now if it be thy son’s coat, or no.
<div class="verse-num">33</div> And he discerned it, and said,
It is my son’s coat! A wicked beast hath devoured him,
a beast hath snatched Joseph!
<div class="verse-num">34</div> And Jacob rent his garments,
and put sackcloth upon his loins,
and mourned for his son many days.
<div class="verse-num">35</div> And all his sons and all his daughters gathered themselves together,
and came to comfort him; but he would not be comforted, saying,
For I will go down to my son mourning into Hades.
And his father wept for him.
<div class="verse-num">36</div> But the Midianites sold Joseph into Egypt
to Potiphar, an eunuch of Pharaoh, chief of the cooks.
