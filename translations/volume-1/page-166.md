**Exodus Chapter 30**

**ΚΕΦ. Λʹ.**

46 φαῆ, καὶ ἔσομαι αὐτῶν Θεός· καὶ γνώσονται, ὅτι ἐγὼ εἰμι Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς αὐτῶν, ὁ ἐξαγαγὼν αὐτοὺς ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, ἐπικληθῆναι αὐτοῖς, καὶ εἶναι αὐτῶν Θεός.

**ΚΕΦ. Λʹ. XXX.**

1. Καὶ ποιήσεις θυσιαστήριον θυμιάματος ἐκ ξύλων ἀσήπτων·
2. καὶ ποιήσεις αὐτὸ πήχεως τὸ μῆκος, καὶ πήχεως τὸ εὖρος, (τετράγωνον ἔσται!) καὶ δύο πήχεων τὸ ὕψος· ἐξ αὐτοῦ ἔσται τὰ κέρατα αὐτοῦ.
3. Καὶ καταχρυσώσεις αὐτὸ χρυσίῳ καθαρῷ τὴν ἔσχασιν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τοὺς τοίχους αὐτοῦ κύκλῳ, καὶ τὰ κέρατα αὐτοῦ· καὶ ποιήσεις αὐτῷ στρεπτὴν στεφάνην χρυσῆν κύκλῳ·
4. καὶ δύο δακτυλίους χρυσοῦς καθαροὺς ποιήσεις αὐτῷ ὑπὸ τὴν στρεπτὴν στεφάνην αὐτοῦ, εἰς τὰ δύο αὐτοῦ κλίτη ποιήσεις ἐν τοῖς δυσὶ πλευροῖς, καὶ ἔσονται ψαλίδες ταῖς σκυτάλαις, ὥστε αἴρειν αὐτὸ ἐν αὐταῖς·
5. καὶ ποιήσεις σκυτάλας ἐκ ξύλων ἀσήπτων, καὶ καταχρυσώσεις αὐτὰς χρυσίῳ.
6. Καὶ θήσεις αὐτὸ ἀπέναντι τοῦ καταπετάσματος, τοῦ ὄντος ἐπὶ τῆς κιβωτοῦ τῶν μαρτυρίων, κατὰ πρόσωπον ἱλαστηρίου, ὃ ἐστιν ἐπὶ τῶν μαρτυρίων, ἐν οἷς γνωσθήσομαί σοι ἐκεῖ.
7. Καὶ θυμιάσει ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῦ Ἀαρὼν θυμίαμα σύνθετον λεπτὸν τὸ πρωῒ πρωῒ· ὅταν ἐπισκευάζῃ τοὺς λύχνους, θυμιάσει ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῦ.
8. Καὶ ὅταν ἐξάπτῃ Ἀαρὼν τοὺς λύχνους, οὐδὲ θυμιάσει ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῦ θυμίαμα ἐνδελεχισμοῦ (διαπαντὸς) ἔναντι Κυρίου εἰς τὰς γενεὰς αὐτῶν.
9. Καὶ οὐκ ἀνοίσετε ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῦ θυμίαμα ἕτερον, κάρπωμα, θυσίαν καὶ σπονδὴν οὐ σπείσετε ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῦ.
10. Καὶ ἐξιλάσεται Ἀαρὼν (ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπιθήσει) ἐπὶ τῶν κεράτων αὐτοῦ ἅπαξ τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ· ἀπὸ τοῦ αἵματος τοῦ καθαρισμοῦ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν (τοῦ ἐξιλασμοῦ) ἅπαξ τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ καθαριεῖ αὐτὸ εἰς τὰς γενεὰς αὐτῶν· ἅγιον τῶν ἁγίων ἐστὶ τῷ Κυρίῳ.
11. Καὶ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, λέγων·
12. ἐὰν λάβῃς τὸν συλλογισμὸν τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τῇ ἐπισκοπῇ αὐτῶν, καὶ δώσουσιν ἕκαστος τὰ λύτρα τῆς ψυχῆς αὐτοῦ τῷ Κυρίῳ, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ἐν αὐτοῖς πτῶσις ἐν τῇ ἐπισκοπῇ αὐτῶν.
13. Καὶ τοῦτό ἐστιν ὃ δώσουσιν ὅσοι ἂν παραπορεύωνται ἐπὶ τὴν ἐπίσκεψιν, τὸ ἥμισυ τοῦ διδράχμου (ὃ ἐστι) κατὰ τὸ δίδραχμον τὸ ἅγιον, εἴκοσι ὀβολοὶ τὸ δίδραχμον· τὸ δὲ ἥμισυ τοῦ διδράχμου, εἰσφορὰ Κυρίῳ.
14. Πᾶς ὁ παραπορευόμενος εἰς τὴν ἐπίσκεψιν ἀπὸ εἴκοσαε-

**THE BOOK OF EXODUS**

**Chapter 30**

46 shall appear, and I will be their God. And they shall know that I am the Lord their God, who brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that My name might be called upon them, and that I might be their God.

**Chapter XXX**

1.  Moreover, thou shalt make an altar for the burning of incense; of incorruptible wood shalt thou make it.
2.  A cubit [shall be] the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, (square shall it be!) and two cubits the height thereof; out of it shall its horns be made.
3.  And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, its border, and its walls round about, and its horns; and thou shalt make unto it a twisted golden crown round about.
4.  And two golden rings, pure and bright, shalt thou make for it beneath its twisted crown; thou shalt make them upon the two sides thereof, on its two flanks, and they shall be sockets for the staves, that it may be borne by them.
5.  And thou shalt make staves of incorruptible wood, and overlay them with gold.
6.  And thou shalt place it before the veil, which is before the ark of the testimonies, before the propitiatory, which is upon the testimonies, there where I shall reveal Myself unto thee.
7.  And Aaron shall burn upon it choice compounded incense every morning; when he trimeth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it.
8.  And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense upon it, an incense of perpetual burning (continually) before the Lord throughout their generations.
9.  And ye shall not offer upon it any other incense, nor burnt offering, nor sacrifice; neither shall ye pour any libation upon it.
10. And Aaron shall make atonement [for it] (upon it, and he shall place [the blood]) upon the horns thereof once in the year; with the blood of the cleansing of sins (the blood of expiation) once in the year shall he cleanse it throughout their generations; it is most holy unto the Lord.
11. And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying:
12. When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel according to their number, then shall every man give a ransom for his soul unto the Lord, that there be no plague among them when thou numberest them.
13. This is what they shall give, every one that passeth among those that are numbered: the half of a didrachma (which is) according to the holy didrachma, twenty obols [shall make] a didrachma; the half of a didrachma shall be an offering unto the Lord.
14. Every one that passeth among those that are numbered, from twenty years [old] and upward, shall give an offering unto the Lord.
