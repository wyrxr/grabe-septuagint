ΑΡΙΘΜΟΙ

ΚΕΦ. Λʹ. ΧΧΧ.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐλάλησε Μωυσῆς τοῖς υἱοῖς ᾿Ισραὴλ κατὰ πάντα ἃ ἐν-
  ετείλατο Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ· καὶ ἐλάλησε Μωυσῆς πρὸς τοὺς ἄρ-
  χοντας τῶν φυλῶν τῶν υἱῶν ᾿Ισραὴλ, λέγων· τοῦτο τὸ ῥῆμα ὃ
2 συνέταξε Κύριος. ῎Ανθρωπος ἄνθρωπος ὃς ἂν εὔξηται εὐχὴν τῷ
  Κυρίῳ, ἢ ὁμόσῃ ὅρκον, ἢ ὁρίσηται ὁρισμῷ περὶ τῆς ψυχῆς αὑ-
  τοῦ, οὐ βεβηλώσει τὸ ῥῆμα αὑτοῦ· πάντα ὅσα ἂν ἐξέλθῃ ἐκ τοῦ
3 στόματος αὑτοῦ, ποιήσει. ᾿Εὰν δὲ γυνὴ εὔξηται εὐχὴν Κυρίῳ,
  ἢ ὁρίσηται ὁρισμὸν ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ πατρὸς αὑτῆς ἐν τῇ νεότητι
4 αὑτῆς, καὶ ἀκούσῃ ὁ πατὴρ αὑτῆς τὰς εὐχὰς αὑτῆς, καὶ τοὺς
  ὁρισμοὺς αὑτῆς οὓς ὡρίσατο κατὰ τῆς ψυχῆς αὑτῆς, καὶ παρασιω-
  πήσῃ αὐτῇ αὑτῆς ὁ πατὴρ, καὶ στήσονται πᾶσαι αἱ εὐχαὶ αὑτῆς,
  καὶ πάντες οἱ ὁρισμοὶ οὓς ὡρίσατο κατὰ τῆς ψυχῆς αὑτῆς, με-
5 νοῦσιν αὐτῇ. ᾿Εὰν δὲ ἀνανεύων ἀνανεύσῃ ὁ πατὴρ αὑτῆς αὐτῇ,
  ᾗ ἂν ἡμέρᾳ ἀκούσῃ πάσας τὰς εὐχὰς αὑτῆς, καὶ τοὺς ὁρισμοὺς
  αὑτῆς οὓς ὡρίσατο κατὰ τῆς ψυχῆς αὑτῆς, οὐ στήσονται· καὶ Κύ-
6 ριος καθαριεῖ αὐτὴν, ὅτι ἀνένευσεν ὁ πατὴρ αὑτῆς αὐτῇ. ᾿Εὰν δὲ
  γενομένη γένηται ἀνδρὶ, καὶ εὐχαὶ αὑτῆς ἐπ᾿ αὑτῇ κατὰ τὴν δια-
  στολὴν τῶν χειλέων αὑτῆς, ὅσα ὡρίσατο κατὰ τῆς ψυχῆς αὑτῆς,
7 καὶ ἀκούσῃ ὁ ἀνὴρ αὑτῆς, καὶ παρασιωπήσῃ αὐτῇ ᾗ ἂν ἡμέρᾳ ἀ-
  κούσῃ, καὶ οὕτω στήσονται πᾶσαι αἱ εὐχαὶ αὑτῆς, καὶ οἱ ὁρισμοὶ
8 αὑτῆς οὓς ὡρίσατο κατὰ τῆς ψυχῆς αὑτῆς, στήσονται. ᾿Εὰν δὲ
  ἀνανεύων ἀνανεύσῃ αὐτῇ ὁ ἀνὴρ αὑτῆς, ᾗ ἂν ἡμέρᾳ ἀκούσῃ, πᾶ-
  σαι αἱ εὐχαὶ αὑτῆς, καὶ οἱ ὁρισμοὶ αὑτῆς οὓς ὡρίσατο κατὰ
  τῆς ψυχῆς αὑτῆς, οὐ μενοῦσιν, ὅτι ἀνὴρ ἀνένευσεν ἀπ᾿ αὑτῆς·
9 καὶ Κύριος καθαριεῖ αὐτὴν. Καὶ εὐχὴ χήρας καὶ ἐκβεβλημένης,
  πάντα ὅσ᾿ ἂν εὔξηται κατὰ τῆς ψυχῆς αὑτῆς, μενοῦσιν αὐτῇ.
10 ᾿Εὰν δὲ ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς αὑτῆς ἡ εὐχὴ αὑτῆς, ἢ ὁ ὁρι-
11 σμὸς ὃν ὡρίσατο κατὰ τῆς ψυχῆς αὑτῆς μεθ᾿ ὅρκου, καὶ ἀκούσῃ
  ὁ ἀνὴρ αὑτῆς, καὶ παρασιωπήσῃ αὐτῇ, καὶ μὴ ἀνανεύσῃ αὐτῇ,
  καὶ στήσονται πᾶσαι αἱ εὐχαὶ αὑτῆς, καὶ πάντες οἱ ὁρισμοὶ αὑ-
  τῆς οὓς ὡρίσατο κατὰ τῆς ψυχῆς αὑτῆς, στήσονται κατ᾿ αὐτῆς.
12 ᾿Εὰν δὲ περιελὼν περιέλῃ αὐτὰ ὁ ἀνὴρ αὑτῆς, ᾗ ἂν ἡμέρᾳ ἀκού-
  σῃ, πάντα ὅσα ἂν ἐξέλθῃ ἐκ τῶν χειλέων αὑτῆς κατὰ τὰς εὐ-

### CHAPTER XXX

1 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel concerning all things which the Lord had commanded Moses; and Moses spake unto the princes of the tribes of the children of Israel, saying: This is the word which the Lord hath commanded.

2 Whosoever he be, if any man shall vow a vow unto the Lord, or shall swear an oath, or shall bind himself by a pledge concerning his soul, he shall not profane his word; all whatsoever shall proceed out of his mouth, that shall he do.

3 But if a woman shall vow a vow unto the Lord, or shall bind herself by a pledge in the house of her father in her youth,

4 And her father shall hear her vows and her pledges wherewith she bound her soul, and her father shall keep silence unto her, concerning herself, then shall all her vows stand, and all her pledges wherewith she bound her soul, shall remain upon her.

5 But if her father shall utterly annul [them] unto her on whatsoever day he shall hear all her vows and her pledges wherewith she bound her soul, they shall not stand;

6 And the Lord shall cleanse her, because her father hath annulled [them] unto her. But if she, having come to be, shall be given unto a man, and her vows be upon her according to the utterance of her lips, whatsoever she bound upon her soul,

7 And her husband shall hear [it], and be silent unto her on whatsoever day he shall hear, then shall all her vows stand, and her pledges wherewith she bound her soul, shall stand.

8 But if her husband shall utterly annul [them] unto her on whatsoever day he shall hear, all her vows and her pledges wherewith she bound her soul, shall not remain, because her husband hath annulled [them] from her;

9 And the Lord shall cleanse her. And the vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, whatsoever she shall vow concerning her soul, shall remain upon her.

10 But if her vow be in the house of her husband, or the pledge wherewith she bound her soul with an oath,

11 And her husband shall hear [it], and be silent unto her, and not annul [it] to her, then shall all her vows stand, and all her pledges wherewith she bound her soul, shall stand upon her.

12 But if her husband shall utterly annul them on whatsoever day he shall hear, all whatsoever shall proceed out of her lips concerning her vows, and concerning the pledges for her soul, shall not remain upon her; her husband hath annulled them, and the Lord shall cleanse her.
