ΚΕΦ. ΛΒ. ΔΕΥΤΕΡΟΝΟΜΙΟΝ
εἰς τὰς πτέρυγας αὐτοῦ, ἐδέξατο αὐτούς, καὶ ἀνέλαβεν αὐτούς, 12
ἐπὶ τῶν μεταφρένων αὐτοῦ. Κύριος μόνος ἦγεν αὐτούς, καὶ οὐκ ἦν
μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ θεὸς ἀλλότριος. Ἀνεβίβασεν αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ τὴν ἰσχὺν τῆς 13
γῆς, ἐζώμισεν αὐτοὺς γεννήματα ἀγρῶν· ἐθήλασεν μέλι ἐκ πέτρας,
καὶ ἔλαιον ἐκ στερεᾶς πέτρας, βούτυρον βοῶν καὶ γάλα προβάτων, 14
μετὰ στέατος ἀρνῶν καὶ κριῶν, υἱῶν ταύρων, καὶ τράγων, μετὰ
στέατος νεφρῶν πυροῦ, καὶ αἷμα σταφυλῆς ἔπιον οἶνον. Καὶ ἔφα- 15
γεν Ἰακὼβ καὶ ἐνεπλήσθη, καὶ ἀπελάκτισεν ὁ ἠγαπημένος, ἐλι-
πάνθη, ἐπαχύνθη, ἐπλατύνθη· καὶ ἐγκατέλιπε Θεὸν τὸν ποιήσαντα
αὐτόν, καὶ ἀπέστη ἀπὸ Θεοῦ σωτῆρος αὐτοῦ. Παρώξυνάν με ἐπ᾿ 16
ἀλλοτρίοις, ἐν βδελύγμασιν αὐτῶν ἐξεπίκρανάν με· ἔθυσαν δαιμο- 17
νίοις, καὶ οὐ Θεῷ, θεοῖς οἷς οὐκ ᾔδεισαν· καινοὶ πρόσφατοι ἤχασιν, οὓς
οὐκ ᾔδεισαν οἱ πατέρες αὐτῶν. Θεὸν τὸν γεννήσαντά σε ἐγκατέλιπες, 18
καὶ ἐπελάθου Θεοῦ τοῦ τρέφοντός σε. Καὶ εἶδε Κύριος, καὶ ἐζήλωσε, 19
καὶ παρωξύνθη δι᾿ ὀργὴν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ καὶ θυγατέρων· καὶ εἶπεν· ἀποστρέ- 20
ψω τὸ πρόσωπόν μου ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν, καὶ δείξω τί ἔσται αὐτοῖς ἐπ᾿ ἐσχάτων·
ὅτι γενεὰ ἐξεστραμμένη ἐστίν, υἱοὶ οἷς οὐκ ἔστι πίστις ἐν αὐτοῖς.
Αὐτοὶ παρεζήλωσάν με ἐπ᾿ οὐ Θεῷ, παρώργισάν με ἐν τοῖς εἰδώ- 21
λοις αὐτῶν· κἀγὼ παραζηλώσω αὐτοὺς ἐπ᾿ οὐκ ἔθνει, ἐπ᾿ ἔθνει ἀσυν-
νέτῳ παροργιῶ αὐτούς. Ὅτι πῦρ ἐκκέκαυται ἐκ τοῦ θυμοῦ μου, καυθή- 22
σεται ἕως ᾅδου κάτω· καταφάγεται γῆν καὶ τὰ γεννήματα αὐτῆς,
φλέξει θεμέλια ὀρέων. Συνάξω εἰς αὐτοὺς κακά, καὶ τὰ βέλη μου 23
συντελέσω εἰς αὐτούς. Τηκόμενοι λιμῷ καὶ βρώσει ὀρνέων, καὶ 24
ὀπισθότονος ἀνίατος· ὀδόντας θηρίων ἐπαποστελῶ εἰς αὐτούς, μετὰ
θυμοῦ συρόντων ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς. Ἔξωθεν ἀτεκνώσει αὐτοὺς μάχαιρα, καὶ 25
ἐκ τῶν ταμείων φόβος· νεανίσκος σὺν παρθένῳ, θηλάζων μετὰ
καθεστηκότος πρεσβυτέρου. Εἶπα· διασπερῶ αὐτούς, καταπαύσω 26
δὴ ἐξ ἀνθρώπων τὸ μνημόσυνον αὐτῶν· εἰ μὴ δι᾿ ὀργὴν ἐχθρῶν, 27
ἵνα μὴ μακροχρονίσωσι, καὶ ἵνα μὴ συνεπιδῶνται οἱ ὑπεναντίοι, μὴ εἴ-
πωσιν· ἡ χεὶρ ἡμῶν ὑψηλή, καὶ οὐχὶ Κύριος ἐποίησε ταῦτα πάντα.
Ὅτι ἔθνος ἀπολωλεκός βουλὴν ἔστι, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν αὐτοῖς ἐπιστήμη, 28
οὐκ ἐφρόνησαν συνιέναι· ταῦτα καταδεξάσθωσαν εἰς τὸν ἐπιόντα χρό- 29
νον· πῶς διώξεται εἷς χίλιους, καὶ δύο μετακινήσουσι μυριάδας, εἰ μὴ 30
ὁ Θεὸς ἀπέδοτο αὐτούς, καὶ ὁ Κύριος παρέδωκεν αὐτούς. Ὅτι οὐκ εἰ- 31
σὶν ὡς ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν οἱ θεοὶ αὐτῶν· οἱ δὲ ἐχθροὶ ἡμῶν ἀνόητοι.

**Deuteronomy 32**

11 [Her wings] doth it spread abroad, taketh them up, and beareth them
12 upon its back. The Lord alone did guide them, and there was no strange god with Him.
13 He made them to ride on the high places of the earth; He fed them with the increase of the fields; He caused them to suck honey out of the rock,
14 and oil from the flinty rock; butter of cows, and milk of sheep, with the fat of lambs and of rams, [even] of the sons of bulls and of goats, with the fat of the kidneys of wheat; and the blood of the grape did they drink as wine.
15 But Jacob ate and was filled, and the beloved waxed fat and kicked; he became gross, he grew thick, he grew wide; then he forsook God Who made him, and departed from God his Savior.
16 They provoked Me to jealousy with strange gods, with their abominations they sorely embittered Me.
17 They sacrificed unto demons, and not unto God; to gods whom they knew not, [gods] newly come up, which their fathers had not known.
18 Of the God Who begat thee, thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten the God Who nourished thee.
19 And the Lord saw, and was moved to jealousy, and was provoked to wrath because of His sons and His daughters.
20 And He said: "I will turn My face from them, and will show them what their latter end shall be; for they are a perverse generation, sons in whom there is no faith."
21 They have provoked Me to jealousy with that which is not God, they have vexed Me with their idols; and I will provoke them to jealousy with [them that are] no people, with a foolish nation will I vex them.
22 For a fire is kindled in My wrath, and it shall burn unto the lowest Hades; and it shall consume the earth with her increase, and shall set on fire the foundations of the mountains.
23 I will heap evils upon them; and My arrows will I spend upon them.
24 They shall be wasted with famine, and devoured by birds, and with an incurable grievous plague; the teeth of beasts will I send upon them, with the fury of creeping things of the earth.
25 Without, the sword shall make them childless, and terror from within their chambers; the young man with the virgin, the sucking child with the established elder.
26 I said: "I will scatter them abroad, and I will make their memorial to cease from among men;"
27 "were it not for the wrath of the enemy, lest they should endure for long, and lest their adversaries should observe [it] together, lest they should say: 'Our hand is mighty, and not the Lord hath done all these things.'"
28 For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any understanding in them.
29 They have not considered to understand; let them receive these things for the time to come.
30 How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousands to flight, except their God had sold them, and the Lord had delivered them up?
31 For their gods are not as our God, and our enemies are devoid of understanding.
