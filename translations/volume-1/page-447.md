λους εἰς ἑξακοσίους ἄνδρας (ἐν τῷ ἀροτρόποδι) ἐκτὸς μόσχων
(βοῶν)· καὶ ἔσωσεν αὐτὸς τὸν Ἰσραήλ.

ΚΕΦ. Δ΄. IV.

1 ΚΑΙ προσέθεντο ἔτι οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ποιῆσαι τὸ πονηρὸν ἔναντι
2 Κυρίου· καὶ Ἀὼδ ἀπέθανε. Καὶ ἀπέδοτο αὐτοὺς Κύριος ἐν χειρὶ
Ἰαβεὶν βασιλέως Χαναάν, ὃς ἐβασίλευσε ἐν Ἀσώρ· καὶ ὁ ἄρχων
τῆς δυνάμεως αὐτοῦ Σισάρα, καὶ αὐτὸς κατῴκει ἐν Ἀρεισὼθ τῶν
3 ἐθνῶν. Καὶ ἐκέκραξαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς Κύριον, ὅτι ἐννακό-
σια ἅρματα σιδηρᾶ ἦν αὐτῷ, καὶ αὐτὸς ἔθλιψε τὸν Ἰσραὴλ κατὰ
4 κράτος εἴκοσι ἔτη. Καὶ Δεββώρα, γυνὴ προφῆτις, γυνὴ Λαφιδώθ,
5 αὕτη ἔκρινε τὸν Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ. Καὶ αὕτη ἐκάθητο
ὑπὸ φοῖνικα Δεββῶρα ἀναμέσον Ῥαμὰ καὶ ἀναμέσον Βαιθήλ, ἐν ὄ-
ρει Ἐφραίμ· καὶ ἀνέβησαν πρὸς αὐτὴν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐκεῖ τοῦ
6 κρίνεσθαι. Καὶ ἀπέστειλε Δεββῶρα, καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸν Βαρὰκ υἱὸν
Ἀβινεὲμ ἐκ Κέδες Νεφθαλεί, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτόν· Οὐχί σοι ἐν-
ετεῖλατο Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ; καὶ ἀπελεύσῃ εἰς ὄρος Θαβώρ,
καὶ λήψῃ μετὰ σεαυτοῦ δέκα χιλιάδας ἀνδρῶν ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν
7 Νεφθαλί, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν Ζαβουλών· καὶ ἀπάξω σε πρὸς τὸν
χειμάῤῥουν Κισῶν ἐπὶ τὸν Σισάρα ἄρχοντα τῆς δυνάμεως Ἰαβείν,
καὶ τὰ ἅρματα αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὸ πλῆθος αὐτοῦ, καὶ παραδώσω αὐ-
8 τὸν ἐν χειρί σου. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτὴν Βαράκ· ἐὰν πορευθῇς μετ᾽
ἐμοῦ, πορεύσομαι, καὶ ἐὰν μὴ πορευθῇς μετ᾽ ἐμοῦ, οὐ πορεύσο-
μαι· ὅτι οὐκ οἶδα τὴν ἡμέραν, ἐν ᾗ εὐοδοῖ Κύριος τὸν ἄγγελον
9 μετ᾽ ἐμοῦ. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτὸν Δεββῶρα· πορευσομένη πορεύ-
σομαι μετὰ σοῦ· πλὴν γίνωσκε, ὅτι οὐκ ἔσται τὸ προτέρημά σου
εἰς τὴν ὁδόν, ἣν σὺ πορεύῃ· ὅτι ἐν χειρὶ γυναικὸς ἀποδώσεται
Κύριος τὸν Σισάρα. Καὶ ἀνέστη Δεββῶρα, καὶ ἐπορεύθη μετ᾽ αὐ-
10 τοῦ Βαρὰκ εἰς Κέδες. Καὶ παρήγγειλε Βαρὰκ τῷ Ζαβουλὼν καὶ
τῷ Νεφθαλὶ εἰς Κέδες, καὶ ἀνέβησαν κατὰ πόδας αὐτοῦ δέκα
11 χιλιάδες ἀνδρῶν· καὶ Δεββῶρα ἀνέβη μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ οἱ πλα-
σίον τοῦ Κεναίου ἐχωρίσθησαν ἀπὸ Καινὰ ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰωβάβ,
γαμβροῦ Μωυσῆ· καὶ ἔπηξε τὴν σκηνὴν αὐτοῦ πρὸς δρῦν ἀνα-
12 παυομένων, ἥ ἐστιν ἐχόμενα Κέδες. Καὶ ἀνήγγειλαν τῷ Σισάρα,
13 ὅτι ἀνέβη Βαρὰκ υἱὸς Ἀβινεὲμ ἐπ᾽ ὄρος Θαβώρ. Καὶ ἐκάλεσε Σι-

**JUDGES**
**CHAPTER 3.**

31 ...Philistines, six hundred men (with the ox-goad), apart from calves (oxen); and he himself saved Israel.

**CHAPTER 4.**

**1.** And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord, after Ehud was dead.
**2.** And the Lord sold them into the hand of Jabin, king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor; and the captain of his host was Sisera, and he himself dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.
**3.** And the children of Israel cried unto the Lord, for he had nine hundred chariots of iron, and he sorely oppressed Israel for twenty years.
**4.** Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.
**5.** And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and between Bethel, in Mount Ephraim; and the children of Israel came up to her there for judgment.
**6.** And Deborah sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedeshnaphtali, and said unto him, "Hath not the Lord God of Israel commanded thee? Go, and draw toward Mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali,
**7.** and of the children of Zebulun; and I will lead thee unto the torrent Kishon, against Sisera, the captain of Jabin’s host, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thine hand."
**8.** And Barak said unto her, "If thou wilt go with me, then will I go; but if thou wilt not go with me, I will not go; for I know not the day wherein the Lord shall prosper the angel with me."
**9.** And Deborah said unto him, "I will surely go with thee: nevertheless know, that the glory shall not be thine on the way which thou goest; for the Lord shall deliver Sisera into the hand of a woman." And Deborah arose, and went with him, even Barak, to Kedesh.
**10.** And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and ten thousand men went up at his heels, and Deborah went up with him.
**11.** And those near unto the Kenite had separated themselves from Kain, from the children of Hobab, the father-in-law of Moses; and the Kenite pitched his tent by the oak of the recliners, which is near Kedesh.
**12.** And they told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to Mount Tabor.
**13.** And Sisera called
