**ΚΕΦ. ΙΔʹ.**
ΚΑὶ **κατέβη** εἰς ᾿Ασκάλωνα· καὶ ἔπεσεν ἐκεῖθεν τριάκοντα ἄνδρας, καὶ ἔλαβε τὰς στολὰς αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔδωκε τοῖς ἀπαγγεῖλαι τὸ πρόβλημα. Καὶ ἐθυμώθη ὀργῇ Σαμψών, καὶ ἀνέβη εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ 20 πατρὸς αὐτοῦ. Καὶ συνώκησεν ἡ γυνὴ Σαμψὼν τῷ νυμφαγωγῷ αὐτοῦ, ὃς ἦν ἑταῖρος αὐτοῦ.

**ΚΕΦ. ΙΕʹ.**
1 ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο μεθ᾿ ἡμέρας ἐν ἡμέραις θερισμοῦ πυρῶν, καὶ ἐπεσκέψατο Σαμψὼν τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ, φέρων ἔριφον αἰγῶν, καὶ εἶπεν· εἰσελεύσομαι πρὸς τὴν γυναῖκά μου εἰς τὸν κοιτῶνα· 2 καὶ οὐκ ἀφῆκεν αὐτὸν ὁ πατὴρ αὐτῆς εἰσελθεῖν πρὸς αὐτήν. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ πατὴρ αὐτῆς· εἶπας εἶπα ὅτι μισῶν ἐμίσησας αὐτήν, καὶ ἔδωκα αὐτὴν τῷ συνεταίρῳ σου. Οὐχ ἰδοὺ ἡ ἀδελφὴ αὐτῆς ἡ νεωτέρα κρείσσων αὐτῆς ἐστιν; ἔστω σοι δὴ ἀντ᾿ αὐτῆς. 3 Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Σαμψών· ἀθῶός εἰμι τὸ ἅπαξ ἀπὸ τῶν ἀλλοφύλων, ὅτι ἐγὼ ποιῶ μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν κακά. 4 Καὶ ἐπορεύθη Σαμψών· καὶ συνέλαβε τριακοσίας ἀλώπεκας, καὶ ἔλαβε λαμπάδας, καὶ συνέδησε κέρκον πρὸς κέρκον, καὶ ἔθηκε λαμπάδα μίαν ἀναμέσον τῶν δύο κέρκων ἐν τῷ μέσῳ. 5 Καὶ ἐξῆψε πῦρ ἐν ταῖς λαμπάσι, καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν εἰς τὰ δράγματα τῶν ἀλλοφύλων· καὶ ἐνεπύρισε τοὺς στάχυας καὶ τὰ προτεθερισμένα ἀπὸ **σταφυλῆς** καὶ ἕως ἑστῶτος, καὶ ἕως ἀμπελῶνος καὶ ἐλαίας. 6 Καὶ εἶπαν οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι· τίς ἐποίησε ταῦτα; Καὶ εἶπαν. Σαμψὼν ὁ γαμβρὸς τοῦ Θαμναθαίου, ὅτι ἔλαβε τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτὴν τῷ συνεταίρῳ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἀνέβησαν οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι, καὶ ἐνεπύρισαν τὴν οἰκίαν τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῆς, καὶ αὐτήν, καὶ τὸν πατέρα αὐτῆς ἐν πυρί. 7 Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς Σαμψών· ἐὰν ποιήσητε οὕτως, οὐκ εὐδοκήσω, ἀλλὰ τὴν ἐκδίκησίν μου ἐξ ἑνὸς καὶ ἑκάστου ὑμῶν ποιήσομαι. 8 Καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτοὺς κνήμην ἐπὶ μηρὸν πληγὴν μεγάλην· καὶ κατέβη, καὶ κατῴκει παρὰ τῷ χειμάρρῳ ἐν τῷ σπηλαίῳ Ἠτάμ. 9 Καὶ ἀνέβησαν οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι, καὶ παρενέβαλον ἐπὶ τὸν Ἰούδαν, καὶ ἐξερίφησαν ἐν Λεχί. 10 Καὶ εἶπαν αὐτοῖς πᾶς ἀνὴρ Ἰούδα· ἱνατὶ ἀνέβητε ἐφ᾿ ἡμᾶς; Καὶ εἶπαν οἱ ἀλλόφυλοι· δῆσαι τὸν Σαμψὼν ἀνέφημεν, καὶ ποιῆσαι αὐτῷ ὃν τρόπον ἐποίησεν ἡμῖν. 11 Καὶ κατέβησαν τρεῖς χιλιάδες ἀνδρῶν ἐξ Ἰούδα ἐπὶ τὴν ὀπὴν τῆς πέτρας

### Judges Chapter 14

**19.** ...and he went down to Ashkelon, and felled thence thirty men, and took their changes of raiment, and gave [them] to them which declared the riddle. And Samson was wroth with great anger, and went up to his father's house.

**20.** And Samson's wife was joined in marriage unto his wedding-companion, who was his friend.

### Judges Chapter 15

**1.** And it came to pass after some days, in the days of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife, bringing a kid of the goats; and he said, "I will go in unto my wife into the bedchamber."

**2.** But her father suffered him not to go in unto her. And her father said, "Thou didst surely say that thou didst utterly hate her; and I gave her unto thy companion. Is not her younger sister more beautiful than she? Let her be thine instead of her."

**3.** And Samson said unto him, "I am innocent this time concerning the Philistines, for I shall do mischief among you."

**4.** And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took torches, and bound them tail to tail, and put one torch in the midst between the two tails.

**5.** And he kindled fire in the torches, and sent them forth into the sheaves of the Philistines; and he burned up both the standing grain and the reaped [sheaves], from the vines even unto the standing grain, and even unto the vineyard and the olive grove.

**6.** Then said the Philistines, "Who hath done this?" And they said, "Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he took his wife, and gave her unto his companion." And the Philistines went up, and burned with fire the house of her father, and both her and her father.

**7.** And Samson said unto them, "If ye do thus [again], I will not be pleased, but I will surely take my vengeance upon each and every one of you."

**8.** And he smote them shin upon thigh with a great slaughter; and he went down and dwelt by the brook in the cave of Etam.

**9.** And the Philistines went up, and encamped against Judah, and were cast forth in Lehi.

**10.** And every man of Judah said unto them, "Wherefore are ye come up against us?" And the Philistines said, "To bind Samson are we come up, and to do to him as he hath done to us."

**11.** And three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock [of] Etam.
