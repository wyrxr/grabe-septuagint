7 μηθῆναι ἐν μερίδι τῆς στιβῆς· ἡ δὲ ἦλθε κρυβῇ, καὶ ἀπεκά-
   λυψε τὰ πρὸς ποδῶν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐκάθευδεν.
8 Ἐγένετο δὲ ἐν τῷ μεσονυκτίῳ, καὶ ἐξέστη ὁ ἀνὴρ, καὶ ἐταράχθη,
   καὶ ἰδοὺ γυνὴ κοιμᾶται πρὸς ποδῶν αὐτοῦ.
9 Εἶπε δέ· τίς εἶ σύ; Ἡ δὲ εἶπεν· ἐγώ εἰμι Ῥοὺθ ἡ δούλη σου·
   καὶ περιβαλεῖς τὸ πτερύγιόν σου ἐπὶ τὴν δούλην σου, ὅτι ἀγχιστεὺς
   εἶ σύ.
10 Καὶ εἶπε Βοός· εὐλογημένη σὺ τῷ Κυρίῳ θύγατερ, ὅτι ἠγάθυνας σου
    τὸ ἔλεος τὸ ἔσχατον ὑπὲρ τὸ πρῶτον, τοῦ μὴ πορευθῆναί σε
    ὀπίσω νεανίων εἴτοι πτωχὸς, εἴτοι πλούσιος.
11 Καὶ νῦν θύγατερ μὴ φοβοῦ· πάντα ὅσα ἐὰν εἴπῃς, ποιήσω σοι·
    οἶδε γὰρ πᾶσα φυλὴ λαοῦ μοῦ ὅτι γυνὴ δυνάμεως εἶ σύ.
12 Καὶ νῦν ἔτι ἀληθῶς ἀγχιστεὺς ἐγὼ εἰμι· καί γε ἔστιν ἀγχιστεὺς
    ἐγγίων ὑπὲρ ἐμέ.
13 Αὐλίσθητι τὴν νύκτα, καὶ ἔσται τῷ πρωΐ ἐὰν ἀγχιστεύσῃ σε,
    ἀγαθόν· ἀγχιστευέτω. Ἐὰν δὲ μὴ βούληται ἀγχιστεῦσαί σε,
    ἀγχιστεύσω σε ἐγώ, ζῇ Κύριος· κοιμήθητι ἕως πρωΐ.
14 Καὶ ἐκοιμήθη πρὸς ποδῶν αὐτοῦ ἕως πρωΐ· ἡ δὲ ἀνέστη πρὸ τοῦ
    ἐπιγνῶναι ἄνδρα τὸν πλησίον αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπε Βοός· μὴ γνωσθήτω,
    ὅτι ἦλθε γυνὴ εἰς τὸν ἅλω.
15 Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ· φέρε τὸ περίζωμα τὸ ἐπάνω σου, καὶ κράτησον
    αὐτό. Καὶ ἐκράτησεν αὐτό· καὶ ἐμέτρησεν ἓξ κριθῶν, καὶ ἐπέθηκεν
    ἐπ᾿ αὐτήν· καὶ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὴν πόλιν.
16 Καὶ Ῥοὺθ εἰσῆλθε πρὸς τὴν πενθερὰν αὐτῆς. Ἡ δὲ εἶπε, τίς εἶ
    θύγατερ;
17 Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ πάντα, ὅσα ἐποίησεν αὐτῇ ὁ ἀνήρ. Καὶ εἶπεν
    αὐτῇ· τὰ ἓξ τῶν κριθῶν ταῦτα ἔδωκέ μοι, ὅτι εἶπε πρός μέ·
    μὴ εἰσέλθῃς κενὴ πρὸς τὴν πενθεράν σου.
18 Ἡ δὲ εἶπε· κάθου θύγατερ, ἕως τοῦ ἐπιγνῶναι σε πῶς οὐ πεσεῖται
    ῥῆμα· οὐ γὰρ μὴ ἡσυχάσει ὁ ἀνὴρ, ἕως ἂν τελέσῃ τὸ ῥῆμα
    σήμερον.

**ΚΕΦ. Δ΄. IV.**

1 ΚΑΙ Βοὸς ἀνέβη ἐπὶ τὴν πύλην, καὶ ἐκάθισεν ἐκεῖ· καὶ ἰδοὺ ὁ
   ἀγχιστευτὴς παρεπορεύετο, ὃν εἶπε Βοός.
2 Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτὸν Βοός· ἐκκλίνας κάθισον ὧδε κρυφῇ. Καὶ
   ἐξέκλινε, καὶ ἐκάθισε. Καὶ ἔλαβε Βοὸς δέκα ἄνδρας ἀπὸ τῶν
   πρεσβυτέρων τῆς πόλεως, καὶ εἶπε· καθίσατε ὧδε. Καὶ ἐκάθισαν.
3 Καὶ εἶπε Βοὸς τῷ ἀγχιστευτῇ· τὴν μερίδα τοῦ ἀγροῦ, ἥ τις εστι
   τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ ἡμῶν τοῦ Ἀλιμέλεχ, ἣ ἐδίδοτε Νωεμὶν τῇ ἐπιστρεφούσῃ
   ἐξ ἀγροῦ Μωάβ.
4 Κἀγὼ εἶπα· ἀποκαλύψω τὸ οὖς σου, λέγων· κτῆσαι ἐναντίον
   τῶν καθημένων, καὶ ἐναντίον τῶν πρεσβυτέρων τοῦ λαοῦ μου· εἴ
   ἀγχιστεύεις, ἀγχίστευε· εἰ δὲ μὴ ἀγχιστεύεις, ἀνάγγειλόν μοι,
   καὶ γνώσομαι ὅτι οὐκ ἔστι πάρεξ σοῦ τοῦ ἀγχιστεῦσαι, κἀγὼ
   εἰμὶ μετά σέ. Ὁ δὲ εἶπεν· ἐγώ εἰμι, ἀγχιστεύσω.

### Chapter 3

**7.** ...to lie down in a portion of the heap [of grain]. And she came in privily, and uncovered [the place at] his feet, and lay down.
**8.** And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was startled, and he was troubled, and behold, a woman lay at his feet.
**9.** Then said he, "Who are you?" And she said, "I am Ruth, your handmaiden. Therefore spread your cloak over your handmaiden, for you are a kinsman redeemer."
**10.** And Boaz said, "Blessed are you of the Lord, my daughter, for you have made good your latter kindness more than the former, in that you did not go after young men, whether poor or rich.
**11.** And now, my daughter, fear not; all that whatsoever you say, I will do for you. For all the kindred of my people knows that you are a woman of valor.
**12.** And now, truly, I am a kinsman redeemer; yet there is a kinsman redeemer nearer than I.
**13.** Abide this night, and it shall be in the morning, if he will redeem you, it is good; let him redeem. But if he will not redeem you, then will I redeem you, as the Lord lives: lie down until the morning."
**14.** And she lay at his feet until the morning; but she rose up before any man should know his neighbor. And Boaz said, "Let it not be known that a woman came to the threshing floor."
**15.** And he said unto her, "Bring hither the mantle that is upon you, and hold it." And she held it; and he measured six [measures] of barley, and laid it upon her; and he went into the city.
**16.** And Ruth went in unto her mother-in-law. And she said, "Who are you, my daughter?"
**17.** And she told her all that the man had done for her. And she said unto her, "These six [measures] of barley he gave me; for he said unto me, 'Go not empty unto your mother-in-law.'"
**18.** Then she said, "Sit still, my daughter, until you shall know how the word shall not fail; for the man will not rest until he finishes the matter today."

### Chapter 4

**1.** Then Boaz went up to the gate, and sat himself down there; and behold, the kinsman redeemer of whom Boaz had spoken was passing by.
**2.** And Boaz said unto him, "Turn aside, sit here [privately]." And he turned aside, and sat down. And Boaz took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, "Sit yourselves down here." And they sat down.
**3.** And Boaz said unto the kinsman redeemer, "The portion of the field, which is of our brother Elimelech, has Naomi, who has returned from the country of Moab, sold.
**4.** And I said, 'I will disclose [it] to your ear, saying, "Acquire [it] before those who sit [here], and before the elders of my people. If you would redeem it, redeem it; but if you would not redeem it, make it known unto me, that I may know there is none to redeem save you, and I am next after you."'" And he said, "I will redeem."
