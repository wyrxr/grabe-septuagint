### Numbers, Chapter 32

9 ἐξέστησαν τὴν καρδίαν τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, ὅπως μὴ εἰσέλθωσιν εἰς τὴν γῆν,
10 ἣν ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς Κύριος. Καὶ ὠργίσθη θυμῷ Κύριος ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, καὶ ὤμοσε, λέγων·
11 εἰ ὄψονται οἱ ἄνθρωποι οὗτοι οἱ ἀναβάντες ἐξ Αἰγύπτου, ἀπὸ εἰκοσαετοῦς καὶ ἐπάνω, οἱ ἐπιστάμενοι
12 τὸ ἀγαθὸν καὶ τὸ κακόν, τὴν γῆν ἣν ὤμοσα Ἀβραὰμ καὶ Ἰσαὰκ καὶ Ἰακώβ· οὐ γὰρ συνηκολούθησαν ὀπίσω μου, πλὴν Χάλεβ
13 υἱὸς Ἰεφοννῆ ὁ διακεχωρισμένος, καὶ Ἰησοῦς ὁ τοῦ Ναυῆ, ὅτι συνεπηκολούθησαν ὀπίσω Κυρίου. Καὶ ὠργίσθη θυμῷ Κύριος ἐπὶ τὸν
14 Ἰσραήλ, καὶ κατερέμβευσεν αὐτοὺς ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ τεσσαράκοντα ἔτη, ἕως ἂν ἐξαναλωθῇ πᾶσα ἡ γενεὰ οἱ ποιοῦντες τὰ πονηρὰ ἔναντι Κυρίου. Ἰδοὺ ἀνέστητε ἀντὶ τῶν πατέρων ὑμῶν, σύστρεμμα ἀνθρώπων
15 ἁμαρτωλῶν, προσθεῖναι ἔτι ἐπὶ τὸν θυμὸν τῆς ὀργῆς Κυρίου ἐπὶ Ἰσραήλ· ὅτι ἀποστραφήσεσθε ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ, προσθεῖναι ἔτι
16 καταλιπεῖν αὐτὸν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ καὶ ἀνομήσετε εἰς ὅλην τὴν συναγωγὴν ταύτην. Καὶ προσῆλθον αὐτῷ, καὶ ἔλεγον· ἐπαύλεις προβάτων
17 οἰκοδομήσωμεν ὧδε τοῖς κτήνεσιν ἡμῶν, καὶ πόλεις ταῖς κατασκευαῖς ἡμῶν, καὶ ἡμεῖς ἐνοπλισάμενοι προφυλακὴν πρότεροι
18 τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, ἕως ἂν ἀγάγωμεν αὐτοὺς εἰς τὸν ἑαυτῶν τόπον· καὶ κατοικήσει ἡ ἀποσκευὴ ἡμῶν ἐν πόλεσι τετειχισμέναις διὰ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας τὴν γῆν. Οὐ μὴ ἀποστραφῶμεν εἰς τὰς οἰκίας
19 ἡμῶν, ἕως ἂν καταμερισθῶσιν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ, ἕκαστος εἰς τὴν κληρονομίαν αὐτοῦ· καὶ οὐκέτι κληρονομήσωμεν ἐν αὐτοῖς
20 ἀπὸ τοῦ πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου καὶ ἐπέκεινα, ὅτι ἀπέχομεν τοὺς κλήρους ἡμῶν ἐν τῷ πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου ἐν ἀνατολαῖς. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτοὺς Μωυσῆς·
21 ἐὰν ποιήσητε κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο, ἐὰν ἐξοπλισθήσησθε ἔναντι Κυρίου εἰς πόλεμον, καὶ παρελεύσεται ὑμῶν
22 πᾶς ὁπλιστὴς τὸν Ἰορδάνην ἔναντι Κυρίου, ἕως ἂν ἐκτριβῇ ὁ ἐχθρὸς αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ, καὶ κατακυριευθῇ ἡ γῆ ἔναντι Κυρίου,
23 καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα ἀποστραφήσεσθε καὶ ἔσεσθε ἀθῶοι ἔναντι Κυρίου, καὶ ἀπὸ Ἰσραήλ· καὶ ἔσται ἡ γῆ αὕτη ὑμῖν ἐν κατασχέσει ἔναντι Κυρίου. Ἐὰν δὲ μὴ ποιήσητε οὕτως, ἁμαρτήσεσθε ἔναντι Κυρίου, καὶ γνώσεσθε
24 τὴν ἁμαρτίαν ὑμῶν, ὅταν ὑμᾶς καταλάβῃ τὰ κακά. Καὶ οἰκοδομήσετε ὑμῖν ἑαυτοῖς πόλεις τῇ ἀποσκευῇ ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐπαύλεις τοῖς κτήνεσιν
25 ὑμῶν, καὶ τὸ ἐκπορευόμενον ἐκ τοῦ στόματος ὑμῶν ποιήσετε. Καὶ εἶπαν οἱ υἱοί Ῥουβὴν καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Γὰδ πρὸς Μωυσῆν, λέγοντες· οἱ
26 παῖδές σου ποιήσουσι, καθὰ ὁ Κύριος ἡμῶν ἐντέταλται. Ἡ ἀποσκευὴ

### Numbers, Chapter 32

9 [they] turned aside the heart of the children of Israel, that they might not enter into the land,
10 which the LORD had given unto them. And the LORD was wroth with indignation in that day, and swore, saying,
11 "Surely, these men who came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, who know [both] good and evil, shall not see
12 the land which I swore unto Abraham, and unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; for they have not wholly followed after Me: save Caleb,
13 the son of Jephunneh, the distinguished, and Joshua the son of Nun; for they have fully followed after the LORD." And the LORD was wroth with indignation against
14 Israel, and He made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until that all the generation that wrought evil in the sight of the LORD was consumed. "Behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, a band of men
15 sinful, to add yet more unto the fierce anger of the LORD against Israel. For if ye turn away from Him, ye shall add yet more [cause for His wrath], by abandoning
16 him in the wilderness, and ye shall transgress against all this assembly." Then came they nigh unto him, and said, "We will build sheepfolds here
17 for our cattle, and cities for our households; and we ourselves will arm ourselves, [and go as] a vanguard before
18 the children of Israel, until we have brought them unto their own place; and our baggage shall dwell in cities fortified, because of those who inhabit the land. We will not return unto our houses,
19 until the children of Israel have been divided, each one into his inheritance. And we shall no more inherit with them
20 from beyond the Jordan and further, for we have received our inheritances beyond the Jordan, eastward." And Moses said unto them,
21 "If ye will do this thing, if ye will arm yourselves for war before the LORD, and if every armed man among you shall pass over
22 the Jordan before the LORD, until He hath driven out His enemies from before Him, and the land be subdued before the LORD,
23 and afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless before the LORD, and before Israel; and this land shall be unto you for a possession before the LORD. But if ye will not do so, then behold, ye shall sin against the LORD, and ye shall know
24 your sin when evils shall overtake you. Now build ye for yourselves cities for your households, and sheepfolds for your cattle,
25 and whatsoever hath proceeded out of your mouth, that shall ye do." And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad spake unto Moses, saying, "Thy
26 servants will do, according as our lord hath commanded. Our baggage,"
