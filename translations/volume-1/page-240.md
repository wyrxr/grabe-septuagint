ΚΕΦ. Κϛ΄. ΛΕΥΙΤΙΚΟΝ
ἐν ἀκαθάρτῳ, καὶ φάγεσθε, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἐμπλησθῆτε. Ἐὰν δὲ ἐπὶ
τούτοις μὴ ὑπακούσητέ μου, καὶ πορεύσησθε πρὸς με πλάγιοι, καὶ
αὐτὸς πορεύσομαι μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν ἐν θυμῷ πλαγίῳ, καὶ παιδεύσω ὑμᾶς ἐγὼ ἑπτάκις κατὰ τὰς ἁμαρτίας ὑμῶν. Καὶ φάγεσθε τὰς
σάρκας τῶν υἱῶν ὑμῶν, καὶ τὰς σάρκας τῶν θυγατέρων ὑμῶν
φάγεσθε. Καὶ ἐρημώσω τὰς στήλας ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐξολοθρεύσω τὰ
ξύλινα χειροποίητα ὑμῶν, καὶ θήσω τὰ κῶλα ὑμῶν ἐπὶ τὰ κῶλα τῶν εἰδώλων ὑμῶν, καὶ προσοχθιεῖ ἡ ψυχή μου ὑμῖν. Καὶ
θήσω τὰς πόλεις ὑμῶν ἐρήμους, καὶ ἐξερημώσω τὰ ἅγια ὑμῶν,
καὶ οὐ μὴ ὀσφρανθῶ τῆς ὀσμῆς τῶν θυσιῶν ὑμῶν· καὶ ἐξερημώσω ἐγὼ τὴν γῆν ὑμῶν, καὶ θαυμάσονται ἐπ᾿ αὐτῇ οἱ ἐχθροὶ ὑμῶν, οἱ ἐνοικοῦντες ἐν αὐτῇ· καὶ διασπερῶ ὑμᾶς εἰς τὰ ἔθνη,
καὶ ἐξαναλώσει ὑμᾶς ἐπιπορευομένη ἡ μάχαιρα, καὶ ἔσται ἡ γῆ
ὑμῶν ἔρημος, καὶ αἱ πόλεις ὑμῶν ἔσονται ἔρημοι. Τότε εὐδοκήσει ἡ γῆ τὰ σάββατα αὐτῆς· (καὶ) πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς ἐρημώσεως αὐτῆς, καὶ ὑμεῖς ἔσεσθε ἐν τῇ γῇ τῶν ἐχθρῶν ὑμῶν·
τότε σαββατιεῖ ἡ γῆ, καὶ εὐδοκήσει (ἡ γῆ) τὰ σάββατα αὐτῆς·
πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς ἐρημώσεως αὐτῆς σαββατιεῖ ἃ οὐκ ἐσαββάτισεν ἐν τοῖς σαββάτοις ὑμῶν, ἡνίκα κατῳκεῖτε αὐτήν. Καὶ
τοῖς καταλειφθεῖσιν ἐξ ὑμῶν ἐπάξω δειλίαν εἰς τὴν καρδίαν αὐτῶν ἐν τῇ γῇ τῶν ἐχθρῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ διώξεται αὐτοὺς φωνὴ φύλλου φερομένου, καὶ φεύξονται ὡς φεύγοντες ἀπὸ πολέμου, καὶ
πεσοῦνται οὐδενὸς διώκοντος· καὶ ὑπερόψεται ὁ ἀδελφὸς τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ ὡσεὶ ἐν πολέμῳ, οὐδενὸς κατατρέχοντος, καὶ οὐ δυ-
νήσεσθε ἀντιστῆναι τοῖς ἐχθροῖς ὑμῶν καὶ ἀπολεῖσθε ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι,
καὶ κατέδεται ὑμᾶς ἡ γῆ τῶν ἐχθρῶν ὑμῶν. Καὶ οἱ καταλειφθέντες ἀφ᾿ ὑμῶν καταφθαρήσονται διὰ τὰς ἁμαρτίας αὐτῶν ἐν τῇ
γῇ τῶν ἐχθρῶν αὐτῶν· καὶ διὰ τὰς ἁμαρτίας τῶν πατέρων αὐτῶν
μετ᾿ αὐτῶν τακήσονται. Καὶ ἐξαγορεύσουσι τὰς ἁμαρτίας αὐτῶν,
καὶ τὰς ἁμαρτίας τῶν πατέρων αὐτῶν, ὅτι παρέβησαν αὐτοὶ καὶ
ὑπερεῖδόν με, καὶ ἔτι ἐπορεύθησαν ἐναντίον ἐμοῦ πλάγιοι· καὶ
ἐγὼ ἐπορεύθην μετ᾿ αὐτῶν ἐν θυμῷ πλαγίῳ, καὶ ἀπολῶ αὐτοὺς
ἐν τῇ γῇ τῶν ἐχθρῶν αὐτῶν· τότε ἐντραπήσεται ἡ καρδία αὐτῶν
ἡ ἀπερίτμητος, καὶ τότε εὐδοκήσουσι τὰς ἁμαρτίας αὐτῶν. Καὶ
μνησθήσομαι τῆς διαθήκης μου Ἰακώβ, καὶ τῆς διαθήκης μου Ἰσαάκ, καὶ τῆς διαθήκης μου Ἀβραὰμ μνησθήσομαι, καὶ τῆς γῆς μνησθήσομαι.

**English Translation:**

**CHAPTER XXVI.**

27 [Ye shall eat] in uncleanness, and ye shall not be satisfied.
But if for all these things ye shall not hearken unto Me, and ye walk perversely against Me,
28 Then will I also walk with you in perverse wrath, and I shall chastise you sevenfold according to your sins.
29 And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.
30 And I shall lay waste your pillars, and I shall utterly destroy your wooden hand-wrought images; and I shall cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your idols, and My soul shall abhor you.
31 And I shall make your cities desolate, and I shall lay waste your holy places, and I shall not smell the savor of your offerings.
32 And I shall lay waste your land, and your enemies who dwell therein shall be astonished at it.
33 And I shall scatter you among the nations, and the sword, as it pursues you, shall consume you; and your land shall be desolate, and your cities shall be laid waste.
34 Then shall the land be pleased with her sabbaths; (and) all the days of her desolation, while ye shall be in the land of your enemies,
35 Then shall the land keep sabbath, and (the land) shall be pleased with her sabbaths; all the days of her desolation shall she keep sabbath, which she kept not in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt therein.
36 And upon those who are left of you, I shall bring faintness into their heart in the land of their enemies; and the sound of a driven leaf shall pursue them, and they shall flee as men flee from war, and they shall fall when none pursueth.
37 And brother shall look down upon his brother as though in war, when none pursueth them; and ye shall not be able to stand before your enemies.
38 And ye shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall consume you.
39 And those who are left of you shall be wasted away because of their sins in the land of their enemies; and because of the sins of their fathers, with them shall they waste away.
40 And they shall confess their sins, and the sins of their fathers, that they transgressed and despised Me; and moreover, they walked perversely against Me.
41 And I, even I, walked with them in perverse wrath, and I shall destroy them in the land of their enemies; then shall their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and then shall they accept their sins.
42 And I shall remember My covenant with Jacob, and My covenant with Isaac, and My covenant with Abraham shall I remember; and I shall remember the land.
