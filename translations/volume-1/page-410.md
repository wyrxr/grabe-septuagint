αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ πέντε ξύλων· καὶ ἦσαν κρεμάμενοι ἐπὶ τῶν ξύλων
ἕως ἑσπέρας. Καὶ ἐγενήθη πρὸς ἡλίου δυσμάς, καὶ ἐνετείλατο 27
Ἰησοῦς, καὶ καθεῖλαν αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ τῶν ξύλων, καὶ ἔῤῥιψαν αὐτοὺς
εἰς τὸ σπήλαιον, εἰς ὃ κατέφυγον ἐκεῖ· καὶ ἐπεκύλισαν λίθους μεγάλους ἐπὶ τὸ σπήλαιον ἕως τῆς σήμερον ἡμέρας. Καὶ τὴν Μακηδὰ 28
ἔλαβεν Ἰησοῦς ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, καὶ ἐφόνευσεν αὐτὴν ἐν
στόματι ξίφους καὶ τὸν βασιλέα αὐτῆς· καὶ ἐξωλόθρευσαν αὐτοὺς
καὶ πᾶν ἔμπνεον ὃ ἦν ἐν αὐτῇ, καὶ οὐ κατελείφθη οὐδεὶς ἐν αὐτῇ διασεσωσμένος καὶ διαπεφευγώς· καὶ ἐποίησαν τῷ βασιλεῖ Μακηδά, ὃν τρόπον ἐποίησαν τῷ βασιλεῖ Ἱεριχώ. Καὶ ἀπῆλθεν Ἰησοῦς 29
καὶ πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἐκ Μακηδὰ εἰς Λεβνά, καὶ ἐπολιόρκει ἐπὶ Λεβνά. Καὶ παρέδωκε καὶ αὐτὴν Κύριος ἐν χειρὶ 30
Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ ἔλαβεν αὐτὴν, καὶ τὸν βασιλέα αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐφόνευσαν
αὐτὴν ἐν στόματι ξίφους, καὶ πᾶν ἔμπνεον ὃ ἦν ἐν αὐτῇ· (καὶ) οὐ
κατελείφθη ἐν αὐτῇ οὐδὲ εἷς διασεσωσμένος καὶ διαπεφευγώς· καὶ
ἐποίησε τῷ βασιλεῖ αὐτῆς, ὃν τρόπον ἐποίησε τῷ βασιλεῖ Ἱεριχώ.
Καὶ ἀπῆλθεν Ἰησοῦς καὶ πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἐκ Λεβνὰ εἰς 31
Λαχεὶς, καὶ περιεκάθισεν αὐτὴν, καὶ ἐπολιόρκει αὐτὴν· καὶ παρέδωκε 32
Κύριος τὴν Λαχεὶς εἰς τὰς χεῖρας Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ ἔλαβεν αὐτὴν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ δευτέρᾳ, καὶ ἐφόνευσεν αὐτὴν ἐν στόματι ξίφους, καὶ ἐξωλόθρευσεν αὐτὴν, ὃν τρόπον ἐποίησε τῇ Λεβνά. Τότε 33
ἀνέβη Αἰλὰμ βασιλεὺς Γαζὲρ, βοηθήσων τῇ Λαχεὶς· καὶ ἐπάταξεν
αὐτὸν Ἰησοῦς ἐν στόματι ξίφους καὶ τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ, ἕως τοῦ
μὴ καταλειφθῆναι αὐτῷ σεσωσμένον καὶ διαπεφευγότα. Καὶ ἀπῆλθεν 34
Ἰησοῦς καὶ πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἐκ Λαχεὶς εἰς Ὀδολλαμ,
καὶ περιεκάθισεν αὐτὴν, καὶ ἐπολιόρκει αὐτὴν· καὶ παρέδωκεν αὐτὴν 35
Κύριος ἐν χειρὶ Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ ἔλαβεν αὐτὴν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, καὶ ἐφόνευσεν αὐτὴν ἐν στόματι ξίφους· καὶ πᾶν ἔμπνεον ὃ
ἦν ἐν αὐτῇ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἐφόνευσαν, ὃν τρόπον ἐποίησαν τῇ
Λαχεὶς. Καὶ ἀπῆλθεν Ἰησοῦς καὶ πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ 36
Ἐγλὼν εἰς Χεβρὼν, καὶ περιεκάθισαν αὐτὴν· καὶ κατελάβοντο αὐτὴν, 37
καὶ ἐπάταξαν αὐτὴν ἐν στόματι ξίφους, καὶ τὸν βασιλέα αὐτῆς, καὶ τὰς πάσας κώμας αὐτῆς, καὶ πάντα τὰ ἐμπνέοντα, ὅσα
ἦν ἐν αὐτῇ οὐκ ἦν διασεσωσμένος· ὃν τρόπον ἐποίησαν τῇ Ὀδολλαμ, ἐξωλόθρευσαν αὐτὴν, καὶ πᾶν ἔμπνεον ὃ ἦν ἐν αὐτῇ. Καὶ 38
ἀπέστρεψεν Ἰησοῦς καὶ πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ εἰς Δαβείρ· καὶ
