ΚΕΦ. Ζ'.
θριζηλώτων ποιηθήσεται εἰς πᾶν ἔργον, καὶ εἰς βρῶσιν οὐ
φάγεται· πᾶς ὁ ἐσθὼν στέαρ ἀπὸ τῶν κτηνῶν, ὧν προσάξει ἀπ᾽ 25
αὐτῶν κάρπωμα Κυρίῳ, ἀπολεῖται ἡ ψυχὴ ἐκείνη ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ
αὐτῆς. Πᾶν αἷμα οὐκ ἔδεσθε ἐν πάσῃ τῇ κατοικίᾳ ὑμῶν ἀπό τε 26
τῶν πετεινῶν καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν κτηνῶν· πᾶσα ψυχὴ ἢ ἂν φάγῃ πᾶν 27
αἷμα, ἀπολεῖται ἡ ψυχὴ ἐκείνη ἀπὸ τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτῆς. Καὶ ἐλά- 28
λησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, λέγων· καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραὴλ λαλή- 29
σεις, λέγων· ὁ προσφέρων θυσίαν σωτηρίου Κυρίῳ, οἴσει τὸ
δῶρον αὐτοῦ Κυρίῳ (καὶ) ἀπὸ τῆς θυσίας τοῦ σωτηρίου αὐτοῦ·
αἱ χεῖρες αὐτοῦ προσούσουσί τὰ καρπώματα Κυρίῳ· τὸ στέαρ τὸ 30
ἐπὶ τοῦ στηθυνίου, καὶ τὸν λοβὸν τοῦ ἥπατος προσούσει αὐτά,
ὥστε ἐπιθεῖναι δόμα ἔναντι Κυρίου. Καὶ ἀνοίσει ὁ ἱερεὺς τὸ στέαρ 31
ἐπὶ τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου· καὶ ἔσται τὸ στηθύνιον Ἀαρὼν καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς
αὐτοῦ· καὶ τὸν βραχίονα τὸν δεξιὸν δώσετε ἀφαίρεμα τῷ ἱερεῖ ἀπὸ 32
τῶν θυσιῶν τοῦ σωτηρίου ὑμῶν· ὁ προσφέρων τὸ αἷμα τοῦ σω- 33
τηρίου καὶ τὸ στέαρ (τὸ) ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν Ἀαρὼν, αὐτῷ ἔσται· ὁ
βραχίων ὁ δεξιὸς ἐν μερίδι. Τὸ γὰρ στηθύνιον τοῦ ἐπιθέματος 34
καὶ τὸν βραχίονα τοῦ ἀφαιρέματος εἴληφα παρὰ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ
ἀπὸ τῶν θυσιῶν τοῦ σωτηρίου ὑμῶν, καὶ ἔδωκα αὐτὰ Ἀαρὼν τῷ
ἱερεῖ καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ νόμιμον αἰώνιον παρὰ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ.
Αὕτη ἡ χρίσις Ἀαρὼν, καὶ ἡ χρίσις τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τῶν 35
καρπωμάτων Κυρίου, ἐν ᾗ ἡμέρᾳ προσηγάγετο αὐτοὺς τοῦ ἱερα-
τεύειν τῷ Κυρίῳ· καθὰ ἐνετείλατο Κύριος δοῦναι αὐτοῖς ἡ ἡμέρα 36
ἐχρίσεν αὐτοὺς παρὰ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ· νόμιμον αἰώνιον εἰς τὰς
γενεὰς αὐτῶν. Οὗτος ὁ νόμος τῶν ὁλοκαυτωμάτων, καὶ θυσίας καὶ 37
περὶ ἁμαρτίας, καὶ τῆς πλημμελείας, καὶ τῆς τελειώσεως, καὶ
τῆς θυσίας τοῦ σωτηρίου ὃν τρόπον ἐνετείλατο Κύριος τῷ Μωυ- 38
σῇ ἐν τῷ ὄρει Σινᾶ, ᾗ ἡμέρᾳ ἐνετείλατο τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραὴλ προσ-
φέρειν τὰ δῶρα αὐτῶν ἔναντι Κυρίου, ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ Σινᾶ.

ΚΕΦ. Η'. VIII.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, λέγων· λάβε Ἀαρὼν 2
καὶ τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰς στολὰς (αὐτοῦ,) καὶ
τὸ ἔλαιον τῆς χρίσεως, καὶ τὸν μόσχον τὸν περὶ τῆς ἁμαρτίας,
καὶ τοὺς δύο κριοὺς, καὶ τὸ κανῦν τῶν ἀζύμων, καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν 3

### English Translation:

### CHAPTER VII.

24 The fat of the hairy ones may be made for any work; but for food it shall not be eaten.
25 For whosoever eateth the fat of the cattle, of which a man shall offer an offering unto the Lord, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
26 Moreover, ye shall eat no manner of blood, in all your habitations, whether of fowl or of beast.
27 For every soul that shall eat any manner of blood, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.

28 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
29 Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, He that offereth a sacrifice of salvation unto the Lord, shall bring his gift unto the Lord, [yea], from the sacrifice of his salvation.
30 His own hands shall offer the offerings unto the Lord; but the fat that is upon the breast, and the lobe of the liver, these shall he offer, to lay them as a gift before the Lord.
31 And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar; and the breast shall be for Aaron and for his sons.
32 And the right shoulder shall ye give as a heave offering unto the priest from the sacrifices of your salvation.
33 He that offereth the blood of the sacrifice of salvation, and the fat, [even that] from among the sons of Aaron, unto him shall it belong; [yea], the right shoulder for his portion.
34 For the breast of the wave offering, and the shoulder of the heave offering, have I taken from the sons of Israel, from the sacrifices of your salvation; and I have given them unto Aaron the priest, and unto his sons, as a perpetual ordinance from among the sons of Israel.
35 This is the anointing of Aaron, and the anointing of his sons, from the offerings [given] unto the Lord, in the day when he brought them near to minister as priests unto the Lord;
36 Even as the Lord commanded to give unto them on the day He anointed them from among the sons of Israel; [this shall be] a perpetual ordinance throughout their generations.
37 This is the law of the burnt offerings, and of the [grain] offering, and concerning the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the sacrifice of consecration, and of the sacrifice of salvation,
38 Which the Lord commanded unto Moses in Mount Sinai, on the day when He commanded the sons of Israel to offer their gifts before the Lord, in the wilderness of Sinai.

### CHAPTER VIII.

1 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
2 Take Aaron, and his sons with him, and his vestments, [his own], and the oil of anointing, and the bullock for the sin offering,
3 And the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread, and all the congregation.
