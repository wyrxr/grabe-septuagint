112 ΕΞΟΔΟΣ ΚΕΦ. Θʹ. Ιʹ.
πρὸς Κύριον, καὶ παυσάσθω τοῦ γενηθῆναι φωνὰς Θεοῦ, καὶ χάλαζαν
καὶ πῦρ· καὶ ἐξαποστελῶ ὑμᾶς, καὶ οὐκέτι προσθήσεσθε μένειν.
29 Εἶπε δὲ αὐτῷ Μωυσῆς· ὡς ἂν ἐξέλθω τὴν πόλιν, ἐκπετάσω τὰς
χεῖράς μου πρὸς τὸν Κύριον εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν, καὶ αἱ φωναὶ παύσονται,
καὶ ἡ χάλαζα καὶ ὁ ὑετὸς οὐκ ἔσται ἔτι· ἵνα γνῷς, ὅτι τοῦ
30 Κυρίου ἡ γῆ. Καὶ σὺ καὶ οἱ θεράποντές σου , ἐπίσταμαι ὅτι οὐδέπω
πεφόβησθε τὸν Κύριον.
31 Τὸ δὲ λίνον καὶ ἡ κριθὴ ἐπλήγη· ἡ γὰρ κριθὴ παρεστηκυῖα, καὶ τὸ
λίνον σπερματίζον.
32 Ὁ δὲ πυρὸς καὶ ἡ ὀλύρα οὐκ ἐπλήγη· ὄψιμα γὰρ ἦν.
33 Ἐξῆλθε δὲ Μωυσῆς ἀπὸ Φαραὼ ἐκτὸς τῆς πόλεως, καὶ ἐξεπέτασε
τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ πρὸς Κύριον, καὶ αἱ φωναὶ ἐπαύσαντο, καὶ ἡ χάλαζα
καὶ ὁ ὑετὸς οὐκ ἔσταξεν ἔτι ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν.
34 Ἰδὼν δὲ Φαραὼ ὅτι πέπαυται ὁ ὑετὸς καὶ ἡ χάλαζα καὶ αἱ φωναί,
προσέθετο τοῦ ἁμαρτάνειν, καὶ ἐβάρυνε τὴν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τῶν
θεραπόντων αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐσκληρύνθη ἡ καρδία Φαραώ,
35 καὶ οὐκ ἐξαπέστειλε τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραήλ, καθάπερ ἐλάλησε Κύριος Μωυσῇ.

ΚΕΦ. Ιʹ. Χ.

1 Εἶπε δὲ Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, λέγων· εἴσελθε πρὸς Φαραώ· ἐγὼ γὰρ
ἐβάρυνα τὴν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ καὶ τῶν θεραπόντων αὐτοῦ,
2 ἵνα ἐξῆς ἐπέλθῃ τὰ σημεῖά μου ταῦτα ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς· ὅπως διηγήσησθε
εἰς τὰ ὦτα τῶν τέκνων ὑμῶν, καὶ τοῖς τέκνοις τῶν τέκνων ὑμῶν,
ὅσα ἐνέπαιγχα τοῖς Αἰγυπτίοις, καὶ τὰ σημεῖά μου, ὅσα ἐποίησα ἐν
αὐτοῖς, καὶ γνώσεσθε ὅτι ἐγὼ εἰμι Κύριος.
3 Εἰσῆλθε δὲ Μωυσῆς καὶ Ἀαρὼν ἐναντίον Φαραώ, καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῷ·
τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τῶν Ἑβραίων· ἕως τίνος οὐ βούλει ἐντραπῆναι
με; ἐξαπόστειλον τὸν λαόν μου, ἵνα λατρεύσωσί μοι.
4 Ἐὰν δὲ μὴ θέλῃς σὺ ἐξαποστεῖλαι τὸν λαόν μου, ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐπάγω
ταύτην τὴν ὥραν αὔριον ἀκρίδα πολλὴν ἐπὶ πάντα τὰ ὅριά σου·
5 καὶ καλύψει τὴν ὄψιν τῆς γῆς, καὶ οὐ δυνήσῃ κατιδεῖν τὴν γῆν· καὶ
κατέδεται πᾶν τὸ περισσὸν τὸ καταλειφθέν, ὃ κατέλιπεν ὑμῖν ἡ χάλαζα,
καὶ κατέδεται πᾶν τὸ ξύλον τὸ φυόμενον ὑμῖν ἐπὶ τῆς
6 γῆς· καὶ πλησθήσονται σου αἱ οἰκίαι, καὶ αἱ οἰκίαι τῶν θεραπόντων
σου, καὶ πᾶσαι αἱ οἰκίαι ἐν πάσῃ γῇ Αἰγύπτου, ἃ οὐδέποτε ἑωράκασιν
οἱ πατέρες σου, οὐδ᾿ οἱ πρόπαπποι αὐτῶν, ἀφ᾿ ἧς ἡμέρας γεγόνασιν ἐπὶ
τῆς γῆς, ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης. Καὶ ἐκκλί-

### EXODUS

#### Chapter 9

**28** unto the LORD, and let the thunderings of God cease, and the hail, and the fire; and I will send you forth, and ye shall no longer tarry.
**29** Then said Moses unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread forth my hands unto the LORD into heaven, and the thunderings shall cease, and the hail and the rain shall no longer be; that thou mayest know that the earth is the LORD's.
**30** But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye have not yet reverenced the LORD.
**31** And the flax and the barley were smitten; for the barley was standing ripe, and the flax was in bloom.
**32** But the wheat and the spelt were not smitten; for they were late [in growth].
**33** And Moses went out from Pharaoh, beyond the city, and spread forth his hands unto the LORD; and the thunderings ceased, and the hail and the rain did not drop any more upon the earth.
**34** But when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunderings had ceased, he sinned yet again, and hardened his heart, and the hearts of his servants also;
**35** thus was the heart of Pharaoh hardened, and he did not send forth the children of Israel, as the LORD had spoken unto Moses.

#### Chapter 10

**1** Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh; for I have hardened his heart, and the hearts of his servants,
**2** that these My signs may come upon them hereafter; and that ye may recount in the ears of your children, and in the ears of your children's children, how I have mocked the Egyptians, and My signs which I have done among them, and ye shall know that I am the LORD.
**3** And Moses and Aaron went in before Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before Me? Send forth My people, that they may serve Me.
**4** But if thou refuse to send forth My people, behold, tomorrow, at this very hour, I will bring a great multitude of locusts upon all thy borders;
**5** and they shall cover the face of the earth, so that thou shalt not be able to behold the earth; and they shall devour every remaining thing which was left for you, that which the hail hath left unto you, and they shall devour every tree that groweth for you upon the earth.
**6** And thy houses shall be filled, and the houses of thy servants, and all the houses throughout all the land of Egypt, such as thy fathers have never seen, nor the fathers of thy fathers, from the day that they were upon the earth even until this day. And [Moses] turned away...
