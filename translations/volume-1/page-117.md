ψω πρὸς τοὺς ἀδελφούς μου τοὺς ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ, καὶ ὄψομαι, εἴ
ἔτι ζῶσι. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰεθὼρ Μωυσῇ· βάδιζε ὑγιαίνων. Μετὰ δὲ
τὰς ἡμέρας τὰς πολλὰς ἐκείνας, ἐτελεύτησεν ὁ βασιλεὺς Αἰγύ-
19 πτου. Εἶπε δὲ Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν ἐν Μαδιὰμ· βάδιζε, ἀπελ-
θε εἰς Αἴγυπτον· τεθνήκασι γὰρ πάντες οἱ ζητοῦντές σου τὴν ψυχήν.
20 Ἀναλαβὼν δὲ Μωυσῆς τὴν γυναῖκα καὶ τὰ παιδία αὐτοῦ, ἀνεβίβα-
σεν αὐτὰ ἐπὶ τὰ ὑποζύγια, καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν εἰς Αἴγυπτον. Ἔλαβε
21 δὲ Μωυσῆς τὴν ῥάβδον τὴν παρὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ. Εἶ-
πε δὲ Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν· πορευομένου σου καὶ ἀποστρέφοντος
εἰς Αἴγυπτον, ὅρα πάντα τὰ τέρατα ἃ ἔδωκα ἐν ταῖς χερσί σου,
ποιήσεις αὐτὰ ἐναντίον Φαραώ· ἐγὼ δὲ σκληρυνῶ αὐτοῦ τὴν καρ-
22 δίαν, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἐξαποστείλῃ τὸν λαόν. Σὺ δὲ ἐρεῖς τῷ Φαραώ·
23 τάδε λέγει Κύριος· υἱὸς πρωτότοκός μου Ἰσραήλ. Εἶπα δέ σοι·
ἐξαπόστειλον τὸν λαόν μου, ἵνα μοι λατρεύσῃ· εἰ μὲν οὖν μὴ
βούλῃ ἐξαποστεῖλαι αὐτόν, ὅρα οὖν, ἐγὼ ἀποκτενῶ τὸν υἱόν σου
24 τὸν πρωτότοκον. Ἐγένετο δὲ ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ ἐν τῷ καταλύματι, συ-
25 νήντησεν αὐτῷ ἄγγελος Κυρίου, καὶ ἐζήτει αὐτὸν ἀποκτεῖναι. Καὶ
λαβοῦσα Σεπφώρα ψῆφον, περιέτεμε τὴν ἀκροβυστίαν τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐ-
τῆς· καὶ προσέπεσε πρὸς τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπεν· ἔστη τὸ
26 αἷμα τῆς περιτομῆς τοῦ παιδίου μου. Καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ,
διότι εἶπεν· ἔστη τὸ αἷμα τῆς περιτομῆς τοῦ παιδίου. Εἶπε δὲ
27 Κύριος πρὸς Ἀαρών· πορεύθητι εἰς συνάντησιν Μωυσῇ εἰς τὴν
ἔρημον. Καὶ ἐπορεύθη, καὶ συνήντησεν αὐτῷ ἐν τῷ ὄρει τοῦ Θεοῦ·
28 καὶ κατεφίλησαν ἀλλήλους. Καὶ ἀνήγγειλε Μωυσῆς τῷ Ἀαρών
πάντας τοὺς λόγους Κυρίου, οὓς ἀπέστειλε, καὶ πάντα τὰ ση-
29 μεῖα ἃ ἐνετείλατο αὐτῷ. Ἐπορεύθη δὲ Μωυσῆς καὶ Ἀαρών, καὶ
συνήγαγον πᾶσαν τὴν γερουσίαν τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἐλάλη-
30 σεν Ἀαρὼν πάντα τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα, ἃ ἐλάλησεν ὁ Θεὸς πρὸς
31 Μωυσῆν· καὶ ἐποίησε τὰ σημεῖα ἐναντίον τοῦ λαοῦ. Καὶ ἐπίστευ-
σεν ὁ λαὸς καὶ ἐχάρη, ὅτι ἐπεσκέψατο ὁ Θεὸς τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσ-
ραήλ, καὶ ὅτι ἴδεν αὐτῶν τὴν θλίψιν· κύψας δὲ ὁ λαός, προ-
σεκύνησε.

καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῷ· τάδε λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ· ἐξαπόστει-

**Exodus**

**Chapter Four**

... [I shall go now] to my brethren who are in Egypt, and I shall see if they yet live. And Jethro said unto Moses, "Go forth, faring well."

19 And it came to pass after those many days, that the king of Egypt died. And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, "Go forth, return to Egypt; for all the men are dead who sought thy life."
20 And Moses took his wife and his children, and set them upon the beasts, and he returned unto Egypt. And Moses took the rod of God in his hand.
21 And the LORD said unto Moses, "When thou goest and returnest into Egypt, see all the wonders which I have put in thy hands; thou shalt do them before Pharaoh. And I will harden his heart, and he shall not send forth the people.
22 But thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, 'Thus saith the LORD, Israel is My firstborn son.'
23 'And I have said unto thee, Send forth My people, that they may serve Me.' But if thou wilt not send them forth, behold now, I will slay thy firstborn son."

24 And it came to pass on the way, in the lodging place, that the Angel of the Lord met him, and sought to slay him.
25 And Zipporah took a stone, and circumcised the foreskin of her son, and she fell at his feet, and said, "The blood of the circumcision of my child hath stood."
26 And he departed from him, because she said, "The blood of the circumcision of the child hath stood."

27 And the LORD said unto Aaron, "Go into the wilderness to meet Moses." And he went, and met him on the Mount of God, and they kissed one another.
28 And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD, which He had sent [him to speak], and all the signs which He had commanded him.
29 And Moses and Aaron went, and gathered all the elders of the sons of Israel.
30 And Aaron spake all these words which God had spoken unto Moses; and he did the signs before the people.
31 And the people believed and rejoiced, because God had visited the sons of Israel, and because He had seen their affliction. And the people bowed down and worshipped.

**Chapter Five**

1 And after these things, Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, "Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, 'Send forth..."
