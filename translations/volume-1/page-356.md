ΔΕΥΤΕΡΟΝΟΜΙΟΝ
ΚΕΦ. ΙΖ'. XVII.

Οὐ προσήσεις Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ σου μόσχον ἢ πρόβατον, ἐν ᾧ ἐστιν ἐν αὐτῷ μῶμος, πᾶν ῥῆμα πονηρόν· ὅτι βδέλυγμα Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ σου ἐστιν.
Ἐὰν δὲ εὑρεθῇ ἐν σοὶ ἐν μιᾷ τῶν πόλεών σου, ὧν Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου δίδωσί σοι, ἀνὴρ ἢ γυνὴ ὅστις ποιήσει τὸ πονηρὸν ἔναντι Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ σου, παρελθεῖν τὴν διαθήκην αὐτοῦ,
καὶ ἀπελθόντες λατρεύσωσι θεοῖς ἑτέροις, καὶ προσκυνήσωσιν αὐτοῖς, τῷ ἡλίῳ ἢ τῇ σελήνῃ, ἢ παντὶ τῷ κόσμῳ τῷ ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, ἃ οὐ προσέταξα,
καὶ ἀναγγελή σοι, καὶ ἀκούσῃς, καὶ ἐκζητήσῃς σφόδρα, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἀληθῶς γέγονε τὸ ῥῆμα, γεγένηται τὸ βδέλυγμα τοῦτο ἐν τῷ Ἰσραήλ,
καὶ ἐξάξεις τὸν ἄνθρωπον ἐκεῖνον ἢ τὴν γυναῖκα ἐκείνην, οἵτινες ἐποίησαν τὸ πρᾶγμα τὸ πονηρὸν τοῦτο, ἐπὶ τὴν πύλην σου, τὸν ἄνδρα ἢ τὴν γυναῖκα, καὶ τελευτήσουσι, καὶ λιθοβολήσουσιν αὐτοὺς ἐν λίθοις.
Ἐπὶ δυσὶ μάρτυσιν ἢ ἐπὶ τρισὶ μάρτυσιν ἀποθανεῖται ὁ ἀποθνήσκων· οὐκ ἀποθανεῖται ἐφ᾽ ἑνὶ μάρτυρι.
Καὶ ἡ χεὶρ τῶν μαρτύρων ἔσται ἐπ᾽ αὐτῷ ἐν πρώτοις, θανατῶσαι αὐτόν, καὶ ἡ χεὶρ παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ ἐπ᾽ ἐσχάτῳ· καὶ ἐξαρεῖτε τὸν πονηρὸν ἐξ ὑμῶν αὐτῶν.
Ἐὰν δὲ ἀδυνατήσῃ ἀπὸ σοῦ ῥῆμα ἐν κρίσει ἀναμέσον αἷμα αἵματος, καὶ ἀναμέσον κρίσις κρίσεως, καὶ ἀναμέσον ἀφὴ ἀφῆς, καὶ ἀναμέσον ἀντιλογία ἀντιλογίας, ῥήματα κρίσεως ἐν ταῖς πόλεσί σου,
καὶ ἀναστὰς ἀναβήσῃ εἰς τὸν τόπον ὃν ἂν ἐκλέξηται Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου ἐν αὐτῷ ἐπικληθῆναι τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ ἐκεῖ·
καὶ ἐλεύσῃ πρὸς τοὺς ἱερεῖς τοὺς Λευΐτας, καὶ πρὸς τὸν κριτὴν ὃς ἂν γένηται ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις, καὶ ἐκζητήσαντες ἀναγγελοῦσί σοι τὴν κρίσιν·
Καὶ ποιήσεις κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα ὃ ἂν ἀναγγείλωσί σοι ἐκ τοῦ τόπου ἐκείνου, οὗ ἂν ἐκλέξηται Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου ἐπικληθῆναι τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ ἐκεῖ, καὶ φυλάξῃ σφόδρα ποιῆσαι κατὰ πάντα ὅσα ἂν νομοθετηθῇ σοι·
κατὰ τὸν νόμον ὃν ἂν φωτίσωσί σοι, καὶ κατὰ τὴν κρίσιν ἣν ἐὰν εἴπωσί σοι, ποιήσεις· οὐκ ἐκκλινεῖς ἀπὸ τοῦ ῥήματος οὗ ἐὰν ἀναγγείλωσί σοι, δεξιὰ οὐδὲ ἀριστερά.
Καὶ ὁ ἄνθρωπος ὃς ἐὰν ποιήσῃ ἐν ὑπερηφανείᾳ, τοῦ μὴ ὑπακοῦσαι τοῦ ἱερέως τοῦ παρεστηκότος λειτουργεῖν ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ σου, ἢ τοῦ κριτοῦ ὃς ἂν γένηται ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις, καὶ ἀπο-

**DEUTERONOMY**
**CHAPTER XVII**

Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the Lord thy God an ox or a sheep, wherein is in it a blemish, [or] every evil thing; for it is an abomination unto the Lord thy God.

If there be found in thee, in one of thy cities, which the Lord thy God giveth thee, a man or a woman who shall do that which is evil before the Lord thy God, to transgress His covenant,
and go and serve other gods, and worship them, the sun, or the moon, or all the host [that is] of heaven, which I have not commanded;
and it be told thee, and thou hearest [of it], and thou shalt inquire diligently; and behold, [if] indeed the matter be true, [if] this abomination hath been wrought in Israel,
then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, who have done this wicked thing, unto thy gate, the man or the woman, and they shall die, and thou shalt stone them with stones.
By the mouth of two witnesses, or of three witnesses, shall he that is worthy of death be put to death; he shall not be put to death by the mouth of one witness.
And the hand of the witnesses shall be upon him first, to put him to death, and the hand of all the people last. So shalt thou put away the evil from among yourselves.

If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between blood and blood, and between judgment and judgment, and between stroke and stroke, and between controversy and controversy, [even] matters of judgment within thy cities,
then shalt thou arise and go up unto the place which the Lord thy God shall choose to place His Name there.
And thou shalt come unto the priests, the Levites, and unto the judge that shall be in those days, and they shall inquire, and shall declare unto thee the sentence of judgment.
And thou shalt do according to the word which they shall declare unto thee from that place, which the Lord thy God shall choose to place His Name there, and thou shalt observe diligently to do according to all that they shall instruct thee:
according to the law which they shall enlighten thee [with], and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee, shalt thou do. Thou shalt not turn aside from the word which they shall declare unto thee, to the right hand, nor to the left.
And the man that shall act presumptuously, so as not to hearken unto the priest who standeth to minister in the Name of the Lord thy God, or unto the judge that shall be in those days, then that man shall die,
