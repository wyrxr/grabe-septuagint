46 τῶν αὐτῶν ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, ἐν τῷ πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου, ἐν φάραγγι, ἐγγὺς οἴκου Φογώρ, ἐν γῇ Σηὼν βασιλέως τῶν Ἀμοῤῥαίων, ὃς κατῴκει ἐν Ἑσεβών, ὃν ἐπάταξε Μωυσῆς καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ
47 Ἰσραήλ, ἐξελθόντων αὐτῶν ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου. Καὶ ἐκληρονόμησαν τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὴν γῆν Ὤγ βασιλέως τῆς Βασάν, δύο βασιλέων τῶν Ἀμοῤῥαίων, οἳ ἦσαν πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου κατὰ ἀνατολὰς ἡλίου,
48 ἀπὸ Ἀροὴρ, ἡ ἐστιν ἐπὶ τοῦ χείλους χειμάῤῥου Ἀρνών, καὶ ἐπὶ τοῦ ὄρους τοῦ Σηὼν, ὃ ἐστι Ἀερμών, πᾶσαν
49 τὴν Ἄραβα (ὃ ἐστιν) πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου κατὰ ἀνατολὰς ἡλίου καὶ ἕως θαλάσσης τῶν δυσμῶν ἡλίου ὑπὸ Ἀσηδὼθ τὴν λαξευτήν.

ΚΕΦ. Ε'. V.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐκάλεσε Μωυσῆς πάντα Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτούς· ἄκουε Ἰσραὴλ τὰ δικαιώματα καὶ τὰ κρίματα, ὅσα ἐγὼ λαλῶ ἐν τοῖς ὠσὶν ὑμῶν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ταύτῃ, καὶ μαθήσεσθε αὐτὰ, καὶ φυλάξεσθε ποιεῖν αὐτά.
2 Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν διέθετο πρὸς ἡμᾶς διαθήκην ἐν Χωρήβ·
3 οὐχὶ τοῖς πατράσιν ἡμῶν διέθετο Κύριος τὴν διαθήκην ταύτην, ἀλλ᾽ ἢ πρὸς ἡμᾶς, ἡμεῖς ὧδε πάντες ζῶντες ἡμεῖς σήμερον.
4 Πρόσωπον κατὰ πρόσωπον ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς ὑμᾶς ἐν τῷ ὄρει ἐκ μέσου τοῦ πυρός,
5 (κἀγὼ εἰστήκειν ἀναμέσον Κυρίου καὶ ἀναμέσον ὑμῶν ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ, ἀναγγεῖλαι ὑμῖν τὰ ῥήματα Κυρίου, ὅτι ἐφοβήθητε ἀπὸ προσώπου τοῦ πυρὸς, καὶ οὐκ ἀνέβητε εἰς τὸ ὄρος,) λέγων·
6 Ἐγὼ εἰμι Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου ὅστις ἐξήγαγόν σε ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, ἐξ οἴκου δουλείας.
7 Οὐκ ἔσονταί σοι θεοὶ ἕτεροι πλὴν ἐμοῦ.
8 Οὐ ποιήσεις σεαυτῷ γλυπτόν, οὐδὲ παντὸς ὁμοίωμα, ὅσα ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ ἄνω, καὶ ὅσα ἐν τῇ γῇ κάτω, καὶ ὅσα ἐν τῷ ὕδατι ὑποκάτω τῆς γῆς·
9 οὐ προσκυνήσεις αὐτοῖς, καὶ οὐ λατρεύσεις αὐτοῖς· ὅτι ἐγὼ εἰμι Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου, Θεὸς ζηλωτὴς, ἀποδιδοὺς ἁμαρτίαν πατέρων ἐπὶ τέκνα ἐπὶ τρίτην καὶ τετάρτην γενεὰν τοῖς μισοῦσί με,
10 καὶ ποιῶν ἔλεος εἰς χιλιάδας τοῖς ἀγαπῶσί με, καὶ τοῖς φυλάσσουσι τὰ προστάγματά μου.
11 Οὐ λήψῃ τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ σου ἐπὶ ματαίῳ· οὐ γὰρ μὴ καθαρίσῃ Κύριος τὸν λαμβάνοντα τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ ματαίῳ.
12 Φύλαξαι τὴν ἡμέραν τῶν σαββάτων ἁγιάζειν αὐτὴν, ὃν τρόπον ἐνετείλατό σοι Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου·

**Chapter Four**

46 of the same, out of the land of Egypt, beyond the Jordan, in the valley, near unto the house of Fogor, in the land of Sihon, king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, whom Moses and the sons of Israel did smite, when they came forth out of the land of Egypt.
47 And they did inherit his land, and the land of Og, king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan toward the rising of the sun,
48 from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the brook Arnon, and upon the Mount of Sion, which is Aermon; all
49 the Arabah (which is) beyond the Jordan toward the rising of the sun, and even unto the sea of the setting of the sun, under Asedoth the carved.

**Chapter Five**

1 And Moses called all Israel, and said unto them: "Hear, O Israel, the statutes and the judgments, all that I speak in your ears this day; and ye shall learn them, and ye shall take heed to do them.
2 The Lord our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.
3 Not with our fathers did the Lord make this covenant, but with us, even us who are all alive here this day.
4 Face to face did the Lord speak with you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire;
5 (and I stood between the Lord and between you at that time, to declare unto you the words of the Lord, because ye were afraid by reason of the face of the fire, and ye went not up into the mountain,) saying:
6 'I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
7 Thou shalt have no other gods beside Me.
8 Thou shalt not make for thyself any graven image, nor any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.
9 Thou shalt not bow down to them, nor serve them; for I am the Lord thy God, a jealous God, recompensing the iniquity of fathers upon children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate Me,
10 and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love Me, and of them that keep My commandments.
11 Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will by no means hold him guiltless that taketh His name in vain.
12 Observe the day of the Sabbaths, to sanctify it, as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee.
13 Six [days shalt thou labour].
