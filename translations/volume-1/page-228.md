    ΚΕΦ. ΚΑ΄. ΛΕΥΪΤΙΚΟΝ 213
    τῷ μὴ ἐγγίζουσι ἀνδρί, ἐπὶ τούτοις μιανθήσεται. Οὐ μιανθήσεται 4
    ἐξάπινα ἐν τῷ λαῷ αὐτοῦ εἰς βεβήλωσιν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ φαλάκρωμα 5
    οὐ ξυρήσεται τὴν κεφαλὴν ἐπὶ νεκρῷ, καὶ τὴν ὄψιν τοῦ πώγωνος
    οὐ ξυρήσονται, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς σάρκας αὐτῶν οὐ κατατεμοῦσιν ἐντομίδας.
    Ἄγιοι ἔσονται τῷ Θεῷ αὐτῶν, καὶ οὐ βεβηλώσουσι τὸ 6
    ὄνομα τοῦ Θεοῦ αὐτῶν· τὰς γὰρ θυσίας Κυρίου, δῶρα τοῦ Θεοῦ
    αὐτῶν αὐτοὶ προσφέρουσι, καὶ ἔσονται ἅγιοι. Γυναῖκα πόρνην καὶ 7
    βεβηλωμένην οὐ λήψονται, καὶ γυναῖκα ἐκβεβλημένην ἀπὸ ἀνδρὸς
    αὐτῆς οὐ λήψονται, ὅτι ἅγιός ἐστι Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ αὐτοῦ. Καὶ 8
    ἁγιάσῃ αὐτόν· τὰ δῶρα Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ὑμῶν οὗτος προσφέρει,
    ἅγιος ἔσται, ὅτι ἅγιος ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ ἁγιάζων αὐτούς. Καὶ θυγάτηρ 9
    ἀνθρώπου ἱερέως ἐὰν βεβηλωθῇ τοῦ ἐκπορνεῦσαι, τὸ ὄνομα
    τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῆς αὐτὴ βεβηλοῖ· ἐπὶ πυρὸς κατακαυθήσεται. Καὶ 10
    ὁ ἱερεὺς ὁ μέγας ἀπὸ τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτοῦ, τοῦ ἐπιχεχυμένου ἐπὶ
    τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ τοῦ ἐλαίου τοῦ χριστοῦ, καὶ τετελειωμένου
    τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ ἐνδύσασθαι τὰ ἱμάτια, τὴν κεφαλὴν οὐκ ἀποξυράσει,
    καὶ τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ οὐ διαρρήξει, καὶ ἐπὶ πάσῃ ψυχῇ 11
    τετελευτηκυίᾳ οὐκ εἰσελεύσεται· ἐπὶ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ, οὐδὲ ἐπὶ μητρὶ
    αὐτοῦ οὐ μιανθήσεται. Καὶ ἐκ τῶν ἁγίων οὐκ ἐξελεύσεται, καὶ 12
    οὐ βεβηλώσει τὸ ἡγιασμένον τοῦ Θεοῦ αὐτοῦ, ὅτι τὸ ἅγιον ἔλαιον
    τὸ χριστὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐπ’ αὐτῷ· ἐγὼ Κύριος. Οὗτος γυναῖκα παρθένον 13
    ἐκ τοῦ γένους αὐτοῦ λήψεται· χήραν δὲ καὶ ἐκβεβλημένην, 14
    καὶ βεβηλωμένην, καὶ πόρνην, ταύτας οὐ λήψεται, ἀλλ’ ἢ παρθένον
    ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ λήψεται γυναῖκα· καὶ οὐ βεβηλώσει τὸ 15
    σπέρμα αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ λαῷ αὐτοῦ· ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ ἁγιάζων αὐτόν.
    16 Καὶ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, λέγων· εἶπον Ἀαρών· ἄνθρωπος 17
    ἐκ τοῦ γένους σου εἰς τὰς γενεὰς ὑμῶν, τινὶ ἐὰν ᾖ ἐν αὐτῷ
    μῶμος, οὐ προσελεύσεται προσφέρειν τὰ δῶρα τοῦ Θεοῦ αὐτοῦ·
    ὅτι πᾶς ἄνθρωπος ᾧ ἐὰν ᾖ ἐν αὐτῷ μῶμος, οὐ προσελεύσεται· 18
    ἄνθρωπος χωλός, ἢ τυφλός, ἢ κολοβόριν, ἢ ὠτότμητος, ἢ ἄνθρωπος 19
    ᾧ ἐστιν ἐν αὐτῷ σύντριμμα χειρός, ἢ σύντριμμα ποδός, ἢ κυρτός, 20
    ἢ ἔρηλος, ἢ πτίλος τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς, ἢ ἄνθρωπος ᾧ ἐὰν ᾖ ἐν αὐτῷ
    ψώρα ἀγρία, ἢ λειχήν, ἢ μονόρχις· πᾶς ᾧ ἔστιν ἐν αὐτῷ μῶμος 21
    ἐκ τοῦ σπέρματος Ἀαρὼν τοῦ ἱερέως, οὐ προσεγγιεῖ τοῦ προσενεγκεῖν
    τὰς θυσίας τοῦ Θεοῦ σου, ὅτι μῶμος ἐν αὐτῷ· τὰ δῶρα τοῦ Θεοῦ
    οὐ προσελεύσεται προσενεγκεῖν. Τὰ δῶρα τοῦ Θεοῦ 22

    ### Chapter 21

    4 For her who hath not known a man, [yet] among these [kin] shall he be defiled. He shall not defile himself suddenly among his people, so as to profane himself.
    5 Nor shall he shave a bald spot upon his head for a dead person, nor shall they shave the appearance of their beard, nor upon their flesh shall they make incisions [or] cuttings.
    6 Holy shall they be unto their God, and they shall not profane the name of their God; for the sacrifices of the Lord, the gifts of their God, they themselves offer, and they shall be holy.
    7 A woman that is a harlot and defiled shall they not take, nor a woman cast out from her husband shall they take, because he is holy unto the Lord his God.
    8 And thou shalt hallow him: for the gifts of the Lord your God doth this one offer; holy shall he be, for holy am I the Lord who halloweth them.
    9 And if a daughter of a priest's man should be defiled by whoring, she herself doth profane the name of her father; by fire shall she be burned.
    10 As for the great priest from among his brethren, upon whose head the oil of anointing hath been poured, and whose hands have been consecrated to put on the garments: his head shall he not shave, and his garments shall he not tear,
    11 and unto any deceased soul he shall not enter; neither for his father, nor for his mother shall he be defiled.
    12 And from the holy [place] he shall not go forth, and he shall not profane the hallowed [things] of his God, for the holy oil, the anointed [oil] of God, is upon him. I am the Lord.
    13 This one shall take a virgin woman from his own kin;
    14 but a widow, and one cast out, and one defiled, and a harlot, these shall he not take; but only a virgin from among his people shall he take as a wife.
    15 And he shall not profane his offspring among his people; I am the Lord who halloweth him.

    16 And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying:
    17 "Say unto Aaron: 'Any man from thy kin throughout your generations, if there be in him a blemish, he shall not draw near to offer the gifts of his God;
    18 for any man in whom there is a blemish, he shall not draw near.
    19 A man [that is] lame, or blind, or mutilated in his nose [or face], or ear-cut, or a man
    20 in whom there is a crushed hand, or a crushed foot, or hunchbacked, or herniated, or with a film over his eyes, or a man in whom there is
    21 a wild scab, or a lichen, or one-testicled; every man in whom there is a blemish from the seed of Aaron the priest, he shall not draw nigh to offer the sacrifices of thy God, for a blemish is in him; the gifts of God he shall not draw near to offer. The gifts of God
