πόλεως. Καὶ ἀνέστη Ἀβιμέλεχ καὶ ὁ λαὸς ὁ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἐκ τῶν
**36** ἐνέδρων. Καὶ εἶδε Γαὰλ υἱὸς Ἀβὲδ τὸν λαόν, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς Ζε-
βούλ· ἰδοὺ λαὸς καταβαίνων ἀπὸ τῶν κορυφῶν τῶν ὀρέων. Καὶ
εἶπε πρὸς αὐτὸν Ζεβούλ· τὴν σκιὰν τῶν ὀρέων σὺ ὁρᾷς ὡς ἄν-
**37** δρας. Καὶ προσέθετο ἔτι Γαὰλ τοῦ λαλῆσαι, καὶ εἶπεν· ἰδοὺ λα-
ὸς καταβαίνων κατὰ θάλασσαν, ἀπὸ τοῦ ἐχόμενα τοῦ ὀμφαλοῦ
τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἀρχὴ μία παραγίνεται ἀπὸ ὁδοῦ δρυὸς ἀπὸ ἐλε-
**38** πόντων. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτὸν Ζεβούλ· ποῦ ἐστι νῦν τὸ στόμα
σου, τὸ λέγον· τίς ἐστιν Ἀβιμέλεχ, ὅτι δουλεύσομεν αὐτῷ; οὐκ
ἰδοὺ οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ λαός, ὃν ἐξουδένωσας ἐν αὐτῷ; ἔξελθε δὴ νῦν
**39** καὶ πολέμει πρὸς αὐτόν. Καὶ ἐξῆλθε Γαὰλ ἀπὸ προσώπου τῶν
**40** ἀνδρῶν Σικίμων, καὶ ἐπολέμησεν ἐν Ἀβιμέλεχ. Καὶ κατεδίωξεν
αὐτὸν Ἀβιμέλεχ, καὶ ἔφυγεν ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἔπεσον
**41** τραυματίαι πολλοὶ ἕως θυρῶν τῆς πόλεως. Καὶ ἐκάθισεν Ἀβιμέλεχ ἐν
Ἀριμά· καὶ ἐξέβαλε Ζεβούλ τὸν Γαὰλ καὶ τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ, τοῦ
**42** μὴ οἰκεῖν ἐν Σικίμοις. Καὶ ἐγενήθη τῇ ἐπαύριον, καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ὁ λαὸς εἰς
**43** τὸ πεδίον, καὶ ἀπηγγέλη τῷ Ἀβιμέλεχ. Καὶ παρέλαβε τὸν λαόν, καὶ
διεῖλεν αὐτοὺς εἰς τρεῖς ἀρχάς, καὶ ἐνέδρευσεν ἐν ἀγρῷ· καὶ εἶδε, καὶ
ἰδοὺ λαὸς ἐξῆλθεν ἐκ τῆς πόλεως, καὶ ἐπανέστη αὐτοῖς καὶ ἐπάταξεν
**44** αὐτούς. Καὶ Ἀβιμέλεχ καὶ αἱ ἀρχαὶ αἱ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ ἐξετάθησαν, καὶ
ἐξέστησαν παρὰ τὴν πύλην τῆς πόλεως· καὶ αἱ δύο ἀρχαὶ ἐξε-
χύθησαν ἐπὶ πάντας τοὺς ἐν τῷ ἀγρῷ, καὶ ἐπάταξαν αὐτούς.
**45** Καὶ Ἀβιμέλεχ ἐπολέμει ἐν τῇ πόλει ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν ἐκείνην, καὶ
κατελάβετο τὴν πόλιν, καὶ τὸν λαὸν τὸν ἐν αὐτῇ ἀνεῖλε· καὶ τὴν
**46** πόλιν καθεῖλε, καὶ ἔσπειρεν αὐτὴν ἅλας. Καὶ ἤκουσαν πάντες
οἱ ἄνδρες πύργου Σικίμων, καὶ εἰσῆλθον εἰς τὸ ὀχύρωμα οἴκου τοῦ
**47** Βάαλ διαθήκης. Καὶ ἀπηγγέλη τῷ Ἀβιμέλεχ ὅτι συνήχθησαν
**48** πάντες οἱ ἄνδρες τοῦ πύργου Σικίμων. Καὶ ἀνέβη Ἀβιμέλεχ εἰς
ὄρος Σελμῶν, αὐτὸς καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ὁ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἔλαβε
Ἀβιμέλεχ τὴν ἀξίνην ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔκοψε φορτίον ξύλων,
καὶ ἔλαβεν αὐτό, καὶ ἐπέθηκεν ἐπὶ τοὺς ὤμους αὐτοῦ· καὶ εἶπε
πρὸς τὸν λαὸν τὸν μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ· τί ἴδετέ με ποιοῦντα, ταχέως ποιή-
**49** σατε ὡς καὶ ἐγώ. Καὶ ἔκοψαν καί γε πάντες αὐτοὶ ἕκαστος φορ-
τίον, καὶ ἦραν, καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν ὀπίσω Ἀβιμέλεχ, καὶ ἐπέθηκαν
ἐπὶ τὸ ὀχύρωμα, καὶ ἐνέπρησαν ἐπ᾿ αὐτοὺς τὸ ὀχύρωμα ἐν πυρί.
καὶ ἀπέκλεισαν πάντες οἱ ἄνδρες πύργου Σικίμων, ὥστε χίλιοι ἄνδρες
