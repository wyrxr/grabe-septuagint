ἡμέρας ἔργα καὶ ποιήσεις πάντα τὰ ἔργα σου, τῇ δὲ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ 14
ἑβδόμη σαββατα Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ σου· οὐ ποιήσεις ἐν αὐτῇ πᾶν
ἔργον, σὺ καὶ ὁ υἱός σου καὶ ἡ θυγάτηρ σου, ὁ παῖς σου καὶ ἡ
παιδίσκη σου, ὁ βοῦς σου καὶ τὸ ὑποζύγιόν σου, καὶ πᾶν κτῆνός
σου, καὶ ὁ προσήλυτός σου ὁ παροικῶν ἐν σοί, ἵνα ἀναπαύσηται ὁ
παῖς σου καὶ ἡ παιδίσκη σου, ὥσπερ καὶ σύ· καὶ μνησθήσῃ ὅτι 15
οἰκέτης ἦσθα ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ, καὶ ἐξήγαγέ σε Κύριος ὁ Θεός
σου ἐκεῖθεν ἐν χειρὶ κραταιᾷ, καὶ ἐν βραχίονι ὑψηλῷ· διὰ τοῦτο
συνέταξέ σοι Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου, ὥστε φυλάξεσθαί σε τὴν ἡμέ-
ραν τῶν σαββάτων, καὶ ἁγιάζειν αὐτήν. Τίμα τὸν πατέρα σου καὶ 16
τὴν μητέρα σου, ὃν τρόπον ἐνετείλατό σοι Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς σου,
ἵνα εὖ σοι γένηται, καὶ ἵνα μακροχρόνιος γένη ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, ἧς
Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου δίδωσί σοι.

Οὐ φονεύσεις. 17
Οὐ μοιχεύσεις. 18
Οὐ κλέψεις. 19
Οὐ ψευδομαρτυρήσεις κατὰ τοῦ πλησίον σου μαρτυρίαν ψευδῆ. 20
Οὐκ ἐπιθυμήσεις τὴν γυναῖκα τοῦ πλησίον σου· οὐκ ἐπιθυμήσεις 21
τὴν οἰκίαν τοῦ πλησίον σου, οὐδὲ τὸν ἀγρὸν αὐτοῦ, οὐδὲ τὸν παῖ-
δα αὐτοῦ, οὐδὲ τὴν παιδίσκην αὐτοῦ, οὐδὲ τοῦ βοὸς αὐτοῦ, οὐδὲ
τοῦ ὑποζυγίου αὐτοῦ, οὔτε παντὸς κτήνους αὐτοῦ, οὔτε πάντα
ὅσα τῷ πλησίον σου ἐστί. Τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα ἐλάλησε Κύριος 22
πρὸς πᾶσαν συναγωγὴν ὑμῶν ἐν τῷ ὄρει ἐκ μέσου τοῦ πυρός·
σκότος, γνόφος, θύελλα, φωνὴ μεγάλη, καὶ οὐ προσέθηκε· καὶ
ἔγραψεν αὐτὰ ἐπὶ δύο πλάκας λιθίνας, καὶ ἔδωκεν ἐμοί. Καὶ 23
ἐγένετο ὡς ἠκούσατε τὴν φωνὴν ἐκ μέσου τοῦ πυρός, καὶ τὸ ὄρος
ἐκαίετο πυρί, καὶ προσήλθετε πρός με πάντες οἱ ἡγούμενοι τῶν
φυλῶν ὑμῶν, καὶ ἡ γερουσία ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐλέγετε· Ἰδοὺ ἔδειξεν ἡμῖν 24
Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν τὴν δόξαν αὐτοῦ καὶ τὴν μεγαλωσύνην αὐτοῦ,
καὶ τὴν φωνὴν αὐτοῦ ἠκούσαμεν ἐκ μέσου τοῦ πυρός· ἐν τῇ ἡμέ-
ρᾳ ταύτῃ εἴδομεν, ὅτι λαλήσει ὁ Θεὸς πρὸς ἄνθρωπον, καὶ ζή-
σεται. Καὶ νῦν μὴ ἀποθάνωμεν, ὅτι ἐξαναλώσει ἡμᾶς τὸ πῦρ 25
τὸ μέγα τοῦτο, ἐὰν προσθῶμεν ἀκοῦσαι ἡμεῖς τὴν φωνὴν Κυρίου
τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν ἔτι, καὶ ἀποθανούμεθα. Τίς γὰρ πᾶσα σὰρξ ἥτις 26
ἤκουσε φωνὴν Θεοῦ ζῶντος, λαλοῦντος ἐκ μέσου τοῦ πυρός, ὡς
ἡμεῖς, καὶ ζήσεται; Πρόσελθε σὺ, καὶ ἄκουσον· πάντα ὅσα ἐὰν 27

**Chapter 5**

14 For six days you shall perform your labors and do all your work; but on the seventh day is the Sabbath unto the Lord your God. You shall do no work therein, neither you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male slave, nor your female slave, nor your ox, nor your beast of burden, nor any of your cattle, nor your sojourner who dwells within your gates, that your male slave and your female slave may rest, even as you.
15 And you shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and that the Lord your God brought you forth thence with a mighty hand and with a high arm. Therefore did the Lord your God command you to keep the day of the Sabbath, and to sanctify it.
16 Honor your father and your mother, in the manner that the Lord your God commanded you, that it may be well with you, and that you may live long upon the land which the Lord your God gives unto you.

17 You shall not murder.
18 You shall not commit adultery.
19 You shall not steal.
20 You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor with false testimony.
21 You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife. You shall not covet your neighbor’s house, nor his field, nor his male slave, nor his female slave, nor his ox, nor his beast of burden, nor any of his cattle, nor anything that belongs to your neighbor.
22 These words the Lord spoke unto all your assembly on the mountain from the midst of the fire: darkness, gloom, tempest, a great voice; and He added no more. And He wrote them upon two tables of stone, and gave them unto me.
23 And it came to pass, when you heard the voice from the midst of the fire, and the mountain burned with fire, then you came near unto me, all the leaders of your tribes and your elders, and you said:
24 “Behold, the Lord our God has shown us His glory and His majesty, and we have heard His voice from the midst of the fire. On this day we have seen that God will speak unto man, and he shall yet live.
25 And now, let us not die, for this great fire will consume us, if we continue to hear the voice of the Lord our God further, and we shall perish.
26 For what is all flesh that has heard the voice of the living God speaking from the midst of the fire, as we have, and shall live?
27 Draw near, you, and hear: all that which…”
