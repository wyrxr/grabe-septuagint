Καὶ ἐξοίσουσι τὸν μόσχον ὅλον ἔξω τῆς παρεμβολῆς, καὶ κατακαύσουσι τὸν 21
μόσχον, ὃν τρόπον κατέκαυσαν τὸν μόσχον τὸν πρότερον· ἁμαρτία συναγωγῆς
ἐστιν. Ἐὰν δὲ δ ἄρχων ἁμάρτῃ, καὶ ποιήσῃ μίαν ἀπὸ πασῶν τῶν ἐντολῶν 22
Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ αὐτοῦ, ἢ οὐ ποιηθήσεται, ἀκουσίως, (καὶ ἁμάρτῃ,) καὶ 23
πλημμελήσῃ, καὶ γνωσθῇ αὐτῷ ἡ ἁμαρτία, ἣν ἡμάρτησεν ἐν αὐτῇ, καὶ 24
προσέισει τὸ δῶρον αὐτοῦ χίμαρον ἐξ αἰγῶν ἄρσεν ἄμωμον· καὶ ἐπιθήσει τὴν
χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν τοῦ χιμάρου· καὶ σφάξουσιν αὐτὸν ἐν τόπῳ, ᾧ 25

στέαρ αὐτοῦ ἀνοίσει ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον, ὥσπερ τὸ στέαρ θυσίας σωτηρίου·
καὶ ἐξιλάσεται περὶ αὐτοῦ ὁ ἱερεὺς ἀπὸ τῆς ἁμαρτίας αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀφεθήσεται
αὐτῷ. Ἐὰν δὲ ψυχὴ μία ἁμάρτῃ ἀκουσίως ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ τῆς γῆς, ἐν τῷ 27

ἁμαρτίας· καὶ σφάξουσιν αὐτὸ περὶ ἁμαρτίας ἐν τόπῳ, οὗ σφάζουσι τὰ 34
ὁλοκαυτώματα. Καὶ λαβὼν ὁ ἱερεὺς ἀπὸ τοῦ αἵματος τοῦ τῆς ἁμαρτίας τῷ

20 upon it: and the priest shall make atonement concerning them, and the sin shall be forgiven them.
21 And they shall carry forth the whole calf outside the camp, and they shall burn up the calf, in the selfsame manner as they burned up the former calf; for it is a sin [offering] of the congregation.

22 If an elder shall sin, and shall do one of all the commandments of the Lord his God which ought not to be done, unwittingly, (and he shall sin,) and shall commit a trespass;
23 and if the sin wherein he hath sinned be made known unto him, then he shall bring his gift, a he-goat from among the goats, a male without blemish.
24 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the he-goat; and they shall slay it in the place where they slay the burnt offerings before the Lord; for it is a sin [offering].
25 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and shall put it upon the horns of the altar of the burnt offerings, and all its blood shall he pour out beside the base of the altar of the burnt offerings.
26 And all its fat shall he offer upon the altar, even as the fat of a peace offering; and the priest shall make atonement for him concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.

27 If a single soul from among the people of the land shall sin unwittingly, by doing one of all the commandments of the Lord which ought not to be done, and shall commit a trespass;
28 and if the sin which he hath committed be made known unto him, then he shall bring his gift, a she-goat from among the goats, a female without blemish shall he bring for his sin, which he hath committed.
29 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his sin offering; and they shall slay the she-goat, the sin offering, in the place where they slay the burnt offerings.
30 And the priest shall take of its blood with his finger, and shall put it upon the horns of the altar of the burnt offerings; and all its blood shall he pour out beside the base of the altar.
31 And all its fat shall he remove, in the manner that fat is removed from a peace offering; and the priest shall offer it upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the Lord; and the priest shall make atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him.

32 If he shall bring his gift for a sin offering a sheep, a female without blemish shall he bring it.
33 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering; and they shall slay it for a sin offering in the place where they slay the burnt offerings.
34 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and shall put it upon the horns of the altar of the burnt offering; and
