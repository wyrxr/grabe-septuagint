ΚΕΦ. ΙΒ΄. ΙΓ΄.
40 Ἡ δὲ παροίκησις τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ ἣν παρῴκησαν ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ καὶ ἐν γῇ Χαναάν, αὐτοὶ καὶ
41 οἱ πατέρες αὐτῶν, ἔτη τετρακόσια τριάκοντα. Ἐγένετο δὲ μετὰ
    τὰ τετρακόσια τριάκοντα ἔτη, ἐξῆλθε πᾶσα ἡ δύναμις Κυρίου ἐκ γῆς
42 Αἰγύπτου νυκτός. Προφυλακὴ ἔστι τῷ Κυρίῳ, ὥστε ἐξαγαγεῖν
    αὐτοὺς ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου· ἐκείνη ἡ νὺξ αὕτη προφυλακὴ Κυρίῳ,
43 ὥστε πᾶσι τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραὴλ εἶναι εἰς γενεὰς αὐτῶν. Εἶπε δὲ
    Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν καὶ Ἀαρών· οὗτος ὁ νόμος τοῦ πάσχα· πᾶς
44 ἀλλογενὴς οὐκ ἔδεται ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ· καὶ πάντα οἰκέτην τινὸς καὶ ἀργυρώνητον περιτεμεῖς αὐτόν, καὶ τότε φάγεται ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ·
45 πάροικος καὶ μισθωτὸς οὐκ ἔδεται ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ.
46 Ἐν οἰκίᾳ μιᾷ βρωθήσεται· (οὐ καταλείψετε ἀπὸ τῶν κρεῶν εἰς τὸ πρωΐ·) οὐκ ἐξοίσετε ἐκ τῆς οἰκίας τῶν κρεῶν ἔξω, καὶ ὀστοῦν οὐ συντρίψετε ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ.
47 Πᾶσα συναγωγὴ υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ ποιήσει τοῦτο.
48 Ἐὰν δέ τις προσέλθῃ πρὸς ὑμᾶς προσήλυτος, καὶ ποιῇ τὸ πάσχα Κυρίῳ, περιτεμεῖς αὐτοῦ πᾶν ἀρσενικόν, καὶ τότε προσελεύσεται ποιῆσαι αὐτὸ, καὶ ἔσῃ ὥσπερ ὁ αὐτόχθων τῆς γῆς·
49 πᾶς ἀπερίτμητος οὐκ ἔδεται ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ. Νόμος εἷς ἔσται τῷ
    ἐγχωρίῳ καὶ τῷ προσηλύτῳ τῷ προσκειμένῳ ἐν ὑμῖν.
50 Καὶ ἐποίησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ καθὰ ἐνετείλατο Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ καὶ Ἀαρών, οὕτως ἐποίησαν.
51 Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ, ἐξήγαγε Κύριος
    τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου σὺν δυνάμει αὐτῶν.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΓ΄. ΧΙΙΙ.
1 Εἶπε δὲ Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, λέγων·
2 ἁγίασόν μοι πᾶν πρωτότοκον πρωτογενὲς καὶ διανοῖγον πᾶσαν μήτραν ἐν τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραὴλ ἀπὸ ἀνθρώπου ἕως κτήνους, ἐμοὶ ἐστιν.
3 Εἶπε δὲ Μωυσῆς πρὸς τὸν λαόν· μνημονεύετε τὴν ἡμέραν ταύτην, ἐν ᾗ ἐξήλθετε ἐξ Αἰγύπτου, ἐξ οἴκου δουλείας, (ἐν γὰρ χειρὶ κραταιᾷ ἐξήγαγεν ὑμᾶς Κύριος ἐντεῦθεν·) καὶ οὐ βρωθήσεται ζύμη·
4 ἐν γὰρ τῇ σήμερον ὑμεῖς ἐκπορεύεσθε ἐν μηνὶ τῶν νέων.
5 Καὶ ἔσται ἡνίκα ἐὰν εἰσαγάγῃ σε Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου εἰς τὴν γῆν τῶν Χαναναίων, καὶ Χετταίων, καὶ Ἀμορραίων, καὶ Εὐαίων, καὶ Ἰεβουσαίων, καὶ Γεργεσαίων, καὶ Φερεζαίων, ἣν ὤμοσε τοῖς πατράσι σου, δοῦναί σοι γῆν ῥέουσαν γάλα καὶ μέλι, καὶ ποιήσεις τὴν λατρείαν ταύτην ἐν τῷ μηνὶ τούτῳ·
6 ἓξ ἡμέρας ἔδεσε ἄζυμα, τῇ δὲ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ ἑορτὴ Κυρίῳ·
7 ἄζυμα ἔδεσθε τὰς ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας· οὐκ ὀφθήσεταί

#### Exodus 12

**40** Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, which they sojourned in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, both they and
**41** their fathers, was four hundred and thirty years. And it came to pass after these four hundred and thirty years, that all the host of the Lord went forth from the land of Egypt by night.
**42** This night is a vigil unto the Lord, [for the purpose] of bringing them forth from the land of Egypt; that same night is a vigil for the Lord, that it may be observed by all the children of Israel throughout their generations.
**43** And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying, This is the ordinance of the Passover: No alien shall eat thereof.
**44** But every man’s slave, bought with silver, thou shalt surely circumcise him, and then shall he eat thereof.
**45** A sojourner and a hired servant shall not eat thereof.
**46** In one house shall it be eaten; (ye shall leave none of the flesh until the morning;) neither shall ye carry forth aught of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof.
**47** All the congregation of the children of Israel shall keep it.
**48** And if a proselyte shall come unto you, and desire to keep the Passover to the Lord, thou shalt circumcise all his males, and then shall he draw near to keep it; and he shall be as one born in the land.
**49** But no uncircumcised man shall eat thereof. One law shall there be for the native-born, and for the proselyte that dwelleth among you.
**50** And the children of Israel did as the Lord commanded Moses and Aaron; so did they.
**51** And it came to pass on that very day, that the Lord did bring forth the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt with their forces.

#### Exodus 13

**1** And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
**2** Sanctify unto Me every firstborn, first-begotten, and whatsoever openeth every womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast; it is Mine.
**3** And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came forth out of Egypt, from the house of bondage, (for by a mighty hand the Lord brought you out from hence;) and no leavened bread shall be eaten.
**4** For this day do ye go forth in the month of new [grain].
**5** And it shall be, when the Lord thy God shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, and the Perizzites, which He sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month.
**6** For six days he ate unleavened bread, and on the seventh day is a feast unto the Lord.
**7** Unleavened bread shall ye eat for seven days; there shall no [leavened bread] be seen
