17 ἔθνη, ὅσα ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς ἐστιν. Εἶπε δὲ Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν· καὶ τοῦτόν σοι τὸν λόγον, ὃν εἴρηκας, ποιήσω· εὕρηκας γὰρ χάριν ἐνώπιον ἐμοῦ, καὶ οἶδά σε παρὰ πάντας.
18 Καὶ λέγει· δεῖξόν μοι τὴν σεαυτοῦ δόξαν.
19 Καὶ εἶπεν· ἐγὼ παρελεύσομαι πρότερός σου τῇ δόξῃ μου, καὶ καλέσω ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι Κυρίου ἐναντίον σου· καὶ ἐλεήσω, ὃν ἂν ἐλεῶ, καὶ οἰκτειρήσω, ὃν ἂν οἰκτειρῶ.
20 Καὶ εἶπεν· οὐ δυνήσῃ ἰδεῖν τὸ πρόσωπόν μου· οὐ γὰρ μὴ ἴδῃ ἄνθρωπος τὸ πρόσωπόν μου, καὶ ζήσεται.
21 Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος· ἰδοὺ τόπος παρ᾿ ἐμοί, καὶ στήσῃ ἐπὶ τῆς πέτρας.
22 Ἡνίκα δ᾿ ἂν παρέλθῃ ἡ δόξα μου, καὶ θήσω σε εἰς ὀπὴν τῆς πέτρας, καὶ σκεπάσω τῇ χειρί μου ἐπὶ σέ, ἕως ἂν παρέλθω·
23 καὶ ἀφελῶ τὴν χεῖρά μου, καὶ τότε ὄψει· τὰ ὀπίσω μου· τὸ δὲ πρόσωπόν μου οὐκ ὀφθήσεταί σοι.

ΚΕΦ. ΛΔʹ. XXXIV.

1 ΚΑΙ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν· λάξευσον σεαυτῷ δύο πλάκας λιθίνας, καθὼς καὶ αἱ πρῶται, καὶ ἀνάβηθι εἰς τὸ ὄρος πρὸς με, καὶ γράψω ἐπὶ τῶν πλακῶν τὰ ῥήματα, ἃ ἦν ἐπὶ ταῖς πλαξὶ ταῖς πρώταις, ἃς συνέτριψας·
2 καὶ γίνου ἕτοιμος εἰς τὸ πρωΐ, καὶ ἀναβήσῃ τὸ πρωΐ εἰς τὸ ὄρος τὸ Σινᾶ, καὶ στῆσον μοι ἐκεῖ ἐπ᾿ ἄκρου τοῦ ὄρους.
3 Καὶ μηδεὶς ἀναβήτω μετὰ σοῦ, καὶ μηδεὶς ὀφθήτω ἐν παντὶ τῷ ὄρει· καὶ τὰ πρόβατα καὶ αἱ βόες μὴ νεμέσθωσαν πλησίον τοῦ ὄρους ἐκείνου.
4 Καὶ ἐλάξευσε δύο πλάκας λιθίνας, καθάπερ αἱ πρῶται· καὶ ὀρθρίσας Μωυσῆς τὸ πρωΐ, ἀνέβη εἰς τὸ ὄρος τὸ Σινᾶ, καθὰ συνέταξεν αὐτῷ Κύριος· καὶ ἔλαβε Μωυσῆς μεθ᾿ ἑαυτοῦ τὰς δύο πλάκας τὰς λιθίνας.
5 Καὶ κατέβη Κύριος ἐν νεφέλῃ, καὶ παρέστη αὐτῷ ἐκεῖ· καὶ ἐκάλεσεν ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι Κυρίου.
6 Καὶ παρῆλθε Κύριος πρὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐκάλεσε Κύριος· Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς οἰκτίρμων καὶ ἐλεήμων, μακρόθυμος καὶ πολυέλεος, καὶ ἀληθινός,
7 καὶ δικαιοσύνην διατηρῶν, καὶ ποιῶν ἔλεος εἰς χιλιάδας, ἀφαιρῶν ἀνομίας καὶ ἀδικίας καὶ ἁμαρτίας, καὶ τὸν ἔνοχον καθαρισμῷ οὐ καθαριεῖ, ἐπάγων ἁμαρτίας πατέρων ἐπὶ τέκνα καὶ ἐπὶ τέκνα τέκνων, ἐπὶ τρίτην καὶ τετάρτην γενεάν.
8 Καὶ σπεύσας Μωυσῆς, κύψας ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, προσεκύνησε·
9 καὶ εἶπεν· εἰ εὗρον χάριν ἐνώπιόν σου, συμπορευθήτω Κύριός μου μεθ᾿ ἡμῶν· ὁ λαὸς γὰρ σκληροτράχηλός ἐστι· καὶ ἀφελεῖς σὺ τὰς ἁμαρτίας

#### Exodus Chapter 33

**17** ...[among] the nations, as many as are upon the earth.
And the LORD said unto Moses: "Even this word which thou hast spoken, I will do it; for thou hast found favor in My sight, and I know thee above all others."

**18** And he said, "Show me, I pray Thee, Thy glory."

**19** And He said, "I will pass by before thee with My glory, and I will proclaim the Name of the LORD before thee; and I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion."

**20** And He said, "Thou canst not see My face, for no man shall see My face and live."

**21** And the LORD said, "Behold, there is a place by Me, and thou shalt stand upon the rock.

**22** And it shall come to pass, when My glory doth pass by, that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock, and will cover thee with My hand until I have passed by.

**23** Then I will take away My hand, and thou shalt see My back parts; but My face shall not be seen of thee."

#### Exodus Chapter 34

**1** And the LORD said unto Moses, "Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up unto Me into the mount; and I will write upon the tables the words that were upon the first tables, which thou didst break.

**2** And be ready by the morning, and thou shalt come up in the morning unto Mount Sinai, and present thyself there to Me on the top of the mount.

**3** And let no man come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor the herds feed nigh unto that mount."

**4** And Moses hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto Mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him; and Moses took in his hand the two tables of stone.

**5** And the LORD descended in a cloud, and stood with him there; and He proclaimed the Name of the LORD.

**6** And the LORD passed by before him, and the LORD proclaimed: "The LORD, the God, compassionate and merciful, long-suffering and abundant in mercy and true,

**7** And keeping righteousness, and showing mercy unto thousands, taking away iniquities and injustices and sins; yet will He by no means clear the guilty by purification, visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and fourth generation."

**8** And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped.

**9** And he said, "If now I have found grace in Thy sight, let my Lord, I pray Thee, go among us; for it is a stiff-necked people; and do Thou remove our sins..."
