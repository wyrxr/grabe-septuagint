ΚΕΦ. Β΄. II.

1 ΚΑὶ ἀνέβη ἄγγελος Κυρίου ἀπὸ Γαλγὰλ ἐπὶ τὸν Κλαυθμῶνα,
καὶ ἐπὶ Βαιθὴλ, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτούς.
Κύριος Κύριος ἀνεβίβασεν ὑμᾶς ἐξ Αἰγύπτου, καὶ εἰσήγαγεν ὑμᾶς
εἰς τὴν γῆν, ἣν ὤμοσε τοῖς πατρᾶσιν ὑμῶν, τοῦ δοῦναι ὑμῖν,
καὶ εἶπεν ὑμῖν· οὐ διασκεδάσω τὴν διαθήκην μου τὴν μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν
2 εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα· καὶ ὑμεῖς οὐ διαθήσεσθε διαθήκην τοῖς ἐγκαθημένοις
εἰς τὴν γῆν ταύτην, οὐδὲ τοῖς θεοῖς αὐτῶν οὐ μὴ προσκυνήσητε,
ἀλλὰ τὰ γλυπτὰ αὐτῶν συντρίψετε, καὶ τὰ θυσιαστήρια αὐτῶν κα-
τασκάψετε· καὶ οὐκ εἰσηκούσατε τῆς φωνῆς μου ὅτε ταῦτα ἐποιή-
3 σατε. Καὶ ἐγὼ εἶπα· οὐ προσθήσω τοῦ μετοικίσαι τὸν λαὸν, ὃν
εἶπα τοῦ ἐξολοθρεῦσαι αὐτοὺς ἐκ προσώπου ὑμῶν, καὶ ἔσονται ὑ-
μῖν εἰς συνοχὰς, καὶ οἱ θεοὶ αὐτῶν ἔσονται ὑμῖν εἰς σκάνδαλον.
4 Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἐλάλησεν ὁ ἄγγελος Κυρίου τοὺς λόγους τού-
τους πρὸς πάντας υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ ἐπῆραν ὁ λαὸς τὴν φωνὴν
5 αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔκλαυσαν. Διὰ τοῦτο ἐκλήθη τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ τόπου ἐκεί-
6 νου, Κλαυθμῶν· καὶ ἔθυσαν ἐκεῖ τῷ Κυρίῳ. Καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν
Ἰησοῦς τὸν λαὸν, καὶ ἀπῆλθον οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἕκαστος εἰς τὸν
οἶκον αὐτοῦ καὶ εἰς τὴν κληρονομίαν αὐτοῦ, τοῦ κατακληρονομῆ-
7 σαι τὴν γῆν. Καὶ ἐδούλευσεν ὁ λαὸς τῷ Κυρίῳ πάσας τὰς ἡμέ-
ρας Ἰησοῦ, καὶ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας τῶν πρεσβυτέρων, ὅσοι ἐμα-
κροημέρευσαν μετὰ Ἰησοῦ, ὅσοι ἔγνωσαν πᾶν τὸ ἔργον Κυρίου τὸ
8 μέγα, ὃ ἐποίησε τῷ Ἰσραὴλ. Καὶ ἐτελεύτησεν Ἰησοῦς υἱὸς Ναυή
9 δοῦλος Κυρίου, υἱὸς ἑκατὸν καὶ δέκα ἐτῶν. Καὶ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν ἐν
ὁρίῳ τῆς κληρονομίας αὐτοῦ ἐν Θαμναθαρές, ἐν ὄρει Ἐφραὶμ ἀπὸ
10 βορρᾶ τοῦ ὄρους Γαάς. Καὶ πᾶσα ἡ γενεὰ ἐκείνη προσετέθησαν
πρὸς τοὺς πατέρας αὐτῶν· καὶ ἀνέστη γενεὰ ἑτέρα μετ᾿ αὐτοὺς,
ὅσοι οὐκ ἔγνωσαν τὸν Κύριον, καὶ τὸ ἔργον ὃ ἐποίησε τῷ Ἰσραὴλ.
11 Καὶ ἐποίησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ τὸ πονηρὸν ἐναντίον Κυρίου,
12 καὶ ἐλάτρευον τοῖς Βααλίμ. Καὶ ἐγκατέλιπον τὸν Κύριον Θεὸν
τῶν πατέρων αὐτῶν, τὸν ἐξαγαγόντα αὐτοὺς ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου,
καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν ὀπίσω θεῶν ἑτέρων ἀπὸ τῶν θεῶν λαῶν αὐτῶν
τῶν περικύκλῳ αὐτῶν, καὶ προσεκύνησαν αὐτοῖς, καὶ παρώργι-
13 σαν τὸν Κύριον· καὶ ἐγκατέλιπον τὸν Κύριον, καὶ ἐλάτρευσαν τῇ

**JUDGES**
**CHAPTER 2.**

**1.** And an Angel of the Lord went up from Gilgal to Bochim,
and to Bethel, and to the house of Israel,
and said unto them,
The Lord, the Lord, hath brought you up out of Egypt,
and hath brought you into the land
which He sware unto your fathers to give unto you;
and He said unto you,
I will not scatter My covenant which [I made] with you for ever:
**2.** And ye shall not make a covenant with the inhabitants of this land;
neither shall ye bow down unto their gods,
but ye shall break down their graven images,
and ye shall overthrow their altars:
but ye have not hearkened unto My voice
when ye did these things.
**3.** And I said, I will no more drive out
from before you the people,
whom I said I would utterly destroy from your presence;
but they shall be unto you for adversaries,
and their gods shall be unto you a stumbling-block.
**4.** And it came to pass, when the Angel of the Lord
had spoken these words unto all the children of Israel,
that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.
**5.** Therefore the name of that place was called Bochim;
and they sacrificed there unto the Lord.
**6.** And Joshua sent the people away;
and the children of Israel went every man unto his house,
and unto his inheritance, to possess the land.
**7.** And the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua,
and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua,
who had known all the great work of the Lord,
which He had wrought for Israel.
**8.** And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died,
being an hundred and ten years old.
**9.** And they buried him in the border of his inheritance
in Timnath-heres, in the mount of Ephraim,
on the north side of the mount Gaash.
**10.** And all that generation were gathered unto their fathers;
and there arose another generation after them,
who knew not the Lord,
nor yet the work which He had wrought for Israel.
**11.** And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord,
and served the Baalim.
**12.** And they forsook the Lord God of their fathers,
who had brought them out of the land of Egypt,
and went after other gods,
[even] of the gods of the peoples that were round about them,
and bowed down unto them,
and provoked the Lord to anger.
**13.** And they forsook the Lord, and served unto the Baal
