1 Ἐν ἀρχῇ ἐποίησεν ὁ Θεὸς τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ τὴν γῆν. Ἡ δὲ γῆ 2
ἦν ἀόρατος καὶ ἀκατασκεύαστος, καὶ σκότος ἐπάνω τῆς ἀβύσσου· καὶ
πνεῦμα Θεοῦ ἐπεφέρετο ἐπάνω τοῦ ὕδατος. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ Θεός· γε- 3
νηθήτω φῶς· καὶ ἐγένετο φῶς. Καὶ ἴδεν ὁ Θεὸς τὸ φῶς, ὅτι καλόν· 4
καὶ διεχώρισεν ὁ Θεὸς ἀνὰ μέσον τοῦ φωτός, καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον τοῦ
σκότους. Καὶ ἐκάλεσεν ὁ Θεὸς τὸ φῶς ἡμέραν, καὶ τὸ σκότος ἐκά- 5
λεσε νύκτα. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἑσπέρα, καὶ ἐγένετο πρωΐ, ἡμέρα μία.
Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ Θεὸς· γενηθήτω στερέωμα ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ ὕδατος, καὶ ἔ- 6
στω διαχωρίζον ἀνὰ μέσον ὕδατος καὶ ὕδατος· καὶ ἐγένετο οὕτως.
Καὶ ἐποίησεν ὁ Θεὸς τὸ στερέωμα, καὶ διεχώρισεν ὁ Θεὸς ἀνὰ μέ- 7
σον τοῦ ὕδατος ὃ ἦν ὑποκάτω τοῦ στερεώματος, καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον τοῦ
ὕδατος τοῦ ἐπάνω τοῦ στερεώματος· καὶ ἐγένετο οὕτως. Καὶ ἐκά- 8
λεσεν ὁ Θεὸς τὸ στερέωμα, οὐρανόν· καὶ ἴδεν ὁ Θεός, ὅτι καλόν.
Καὶ ἐγένετο ἑσπέρα, καὶ ἐγένετο πρωΐ, ἡμέρα δευτέρα. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ 9
Θεός· συναχθήτω τὸ ὕδωρ τὸ ὑποκάτω τοῦ οὐρανοῦ εἰς συναγωγήν
μίαν, καὶ ὀφθήτω ἡ ξηρά· καὶ ἐγένετο οὕτως· καὶ συνήχθη τὸ ὕδωρ
τὸ ὑποκάτω τοῦ οὐρανοῦ εἰς τὰς συναγωγὰς αὐτῶν, καὶ ὤφθη ἡ
ξηρά. Καὶ ἐκάλεσεν ὁ Θεὸς τὴν ξηράν, γῆν, καὶ τὰ συστήματα τῶν 10
ὑδάτων ἐκάλεσε θαλάσσας· καὶ ἴδεν ὁ Θεός, ὅτι καλόν. Καὶ εἶπεν 11
ὁ Θεός· βλαστησάτω ἡ γῆ βοτάνην χόρτου, σπεῖρον σπέρμα κατὰ
γένος καὶ καθ’ ὁμοιότητα, καὶ ξύλον κάρπιμον ποιοῦν καρπόν, οὗ τὸ
σπέρμα αὐτοῦ ἐν αὐτῷ κατὰ γένος εἰς ὁμοιότητα, ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς· καὶ
ἐγένετο οὕτως. Καὶ ἐξήνεγκεν ἡ γῆ βοτάνην χόρτου, σπεῖρον σπέρ- 12
μα κατὰ γένος (καὶ καθ’ ὁμοιότητα), καὶ ξύλον κάρπιμον ποιοῦν
καρπόν, οὗ τὸ σπέρμα αὐτοῦ ἐν αὐτῷ κατὰ γένος ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς· καὶ
ἴδεν ὁ Θεός, ὅτι καλόν. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἑσπέρα, καὶ ἐγένετο πρωΐ, ἡ- 13

**THE GENESIS OF THE WORLD**
**CHAPTER ONE**

<br>
1 In the beginning did God create the heaven and the earth.
2 Now the earth was invisible and unfurnished, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the Spirit of God was borne upon the face of the waters.
3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
4 And God did see the light, that it was good; and God did divide between the light and between the darkness.
5 And God did call the light Day, and the darkness did He call Night. And there was evening, and there was morning, day one.

<br>
6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it be dividing between water and water: and it was so.
7 And God did make the firmament, and God did divide between the water which was under the firmament, and between the water which was above the firmament: and it was so.
8 And God did call the firmament Heaven. And God did see that it was good. And there was evening, and there was morning, a second day.

<br>
9 And God said, Let the water which is under the heaven be gathered together unto one gathering, and let the dry land appear: and it was so; and the water which was under the heaven was gathered together unto their gatherings, and the dry land did appear.
10 And God did call the dry land Earth; and the gatherings of the waters did He call Seas. And God did see that it was good.
11 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the herb of grass, sowing seed according to its kind and according to its likeness; and the fruitful tree yielding fruit, whose seed is in itself according to its kind unto likeness, upon the earth: and it was so.
12 And the earth did bring forth the herb of grass, sowing seed according to its kind (and according to its likeness), and the fruitful tree yielding fruit, whose seed is in itself according to its kind upon the earth. And God did see that it was good.
13 And there was evening, and there was morning, a third day.
