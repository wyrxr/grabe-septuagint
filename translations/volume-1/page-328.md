ἕως τοῦ μὴ καταλιπεῖν αὐτοῦ σπέρμα. Καὶ ἐκρατήσαμεν πασῶν 4
τῶν πόλεων αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ, οὐχ ἦν πόλις, ἣν οὐκ
ἐλάβομεν παρ᾿ αὐτῶν· ἑξήκοντα πόλεις, πάντα τὰ περίχωρα Ἀργὸβ
βασιλέως Ὠγ ἐν Βασάν, πᾶσαι πόλεις ὀχυραί, τείχη ὑψηλά, 5
πύλαι καὶ μοχλοί, πλὴν τῶν πόλεων τῶν Φερεζχαίων τῶν πολλῶν
σφόδρα· ἐξωλεθρεύσαμεν αὐτούς, ὥσπερ ἐποιήσαμεν τὸν Σηὼν βα- 6
σιλέα Ἑσεβών, καὶ ἐξωλεθρεύσαμεν πᾶσαν πόλιν ἑξῆς, καὶ τὰς
γυναῖκας αὐτῶν καὶ τὰ παιδία· καὶ πάντα τὰ κτήνη, καὶ τὰ σκῦ- 7
λα τῶν πόλεων ἐπρονομεύσαμεν ἑαυτοῖς. Καὶ ἐλάβομεν ἐν τῷ και- 8
ρῷ ἐκείνῳ τὴν γῆν ἐκ χειρῶν δύο βασιλέων τῶν Ἀμοῤῥαίων, οἳ
ἦσαν πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου ἀπὸ τοῦ χειμάῤῥου Ἀρνῶν ἕως Ἀερ-
μῶν (οἱ Φοίνικες ἐπονομάζουσι τὸ Ἀερμὼν Σανιὼρ, καὶ ὁ Ἀ- 9
μοῤῥαῖος ἐπωνόμασεν αὐτὸ Σανείρ). Πᾶσαι πόλεις Μεισὼρ, καὶ 10
πᾶσα Γαλαάδ, καὶ πᾶσα Βασὰν ἕως Σελχᾶ καὶ Ἐδραείμ, πό-
λεις βασιλείας τοῦ Ὠγ ἐν τῇ Βασάν· ὅτι πλὴν Ὠγ βασιλεὺς 11
Βασὰν κατελείφθη ἀπὸ τῶν Ῥαφαείν· ἰδοὺ ἡ κλίνη αὐτοῦ κλίνη
σιδηρᾶ, ἰδοὺ αὕτη ἐν τῇ ἄκρα τῶν υἱῶν Ἀμμάμ· ἐννέα πήχεων
τὸ μῆκος αὐτῆς, καὶ τεσσάρων πήχεων τὸ εὖρος αὐτῆς ἐν πή-
χει ἀνδρός. Καὶ τὴν γῆν ἐκείνην ἐκληρονομήσαμεν ἐν τῷ καιρῷ 12
ἐκείνῳ ἀπὸ Ἀροὴρ, ἥ ἐστι παρὰ τὸ χεῖλος χειμάῤῥου Ἀρνῶν,
καὶ τὸ ἥμισυ τοῦ ὄρους Γαλαάδ. Καὶ τὰς πόλεις αὐτοῦ ἔδωκα
τῷ Ῥουβὴν καὶ τῷ Γάδ· καὶ τὸ κατάλοιπον τοῦ Γαλαάδ, καὶ 13
πᾶσαν τὴν Βασὰν, βασιλείαν Ὠγ ἔδωκα τῷ ἡμίσει φυλῆς Μα-
νασσῆ, καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν περίχωρον Ἀργὸβ, πᾶσαν τὴν Βασὰν ἐ-
κείνην, γῆ Ῥαφαεὶν λογισθήσεται. Καὶ Ἰαεὶρ υἱὸς Μανασσῆ ἔλαβε 14
πᾶσαν τὴν περίχωρον Ἀργὸβ ἕως τῶν ὁρίων Γαργασεὶ καὶ Μα-
χαθεί· καὶ ὁ Ἰαεὶρ ἐπωνόμασεν αὐτὸ ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι αὐτοῦ, τὴν
Βασὰν Αὐθὼ Ἰαεὶρ ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης. Καὶ τῷ Μαχεὶρ 15
ἔδωκα τὴν Γαλαάδ. Καὶ τῷ Ῥουβὴν καὶ τῷ Γὰδ ἔδωκα ἀπὸ τῆς 16
Γαλαὰδ ἕως χειμάῤῥου Ἀρνῶν, μέσον τοῦ χειμάῤῥου ἔριον, καὶ
ἕως τοῦ Ἰαβὸκ· ὁ χειμάῤῥους ὅριον τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἀμμάν. Καὶ ἡ 17
Ἄραβα καὶ ὁ Ἰορδάνης ὅριον (ἀπὸ) Μαγενεβὰ, καὶ ἕως θαλάσσης
Ἄραβα, θαλάσσης ἁλυκῆς, ὑπὸ Ἀσηδὼθ τὴν Φασγὰ ἀνατολῶν.
Καὶ ἐνετειλάμην ὑμῖν ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ, λέγων· Κύριος ὁ 18
Θεὸς ὑμῶν δέδωκεν ὑμῖν τὴν γῆν ταύτην ἐν κλήρῳ· ἐνωπλισάμενοι
προπορεύεσθε πρὸ προσώπου τῶν ἀδελφῶν ὑμῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ. πᾶς

**Literary Translation:**

**CHAPTER 3**

4 until none of his seed was left. And we captured all his cities at that time; there was no city which we took not from them: sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan, all cities fortified with high walls, 5 with gates and bars; apart from the cities of the Perizzites, which were exceedingly many. 6 We utterly destroyed them, even as we did unto Sihon, king of Heshbon, and we utterly destroyed every city in succession, with their women and their children. 7 And all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we made a prey unto ourselves.

8 And we took at that time the land out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond Jordan, from the brook Arnon unto Hermon 9 (the Phoenicians do name Hermon Sanior, and the Amorite did name it Senir). 10 All the cities of Misor, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 11 For only Og, king of Bashan, remained of the remnant of the Rephaim. Behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; behold, it is in the stronghold of the children of Ammam. Nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth thereof, after the cubit of a man.

12 And that land we inherited at that time, from Aroer, which is by the edge of the brook Arnon, and half of the mountain of Gilead. And its cities I gave unto Reuben and unto Gad; 13 and the remnant of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave unto the half-tribe of Manasseh, and all the region of Argob, all that Bashan; it shall be accounted the land of the Rephaim. 14 And Jair, the son of Manasseh, took all the region of Argob, unto the borders of Gargasei and Machathei. And Jair named it after his own name, Bashan-Havvoth-Jair, unto this day. 15 And unto Machir I gave Gilead.

16 And unto Reuben and unto Gad I gave from Gilead unto the brook Arnon, the midst of the brook, [even] wool, and unto Jabbok; 17 the brook [being] the border for the children of Ammon. And the Arabah and the Jordan [were] a border (from) Magenneba, and unto the Sea of Arabah, the Salt Sea, beneath the slopes of Pisgah eastward.

18 And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you this land for an inheritance: being armed, ye shall go before the face of your brethren, the children of Israel, every mighty man.
