ΑΡΙΘΜΟΙ
ΚΕΦ. ΙΔʹ.
20 ἕως τοῦ νῦν. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Μωϋσῆν· Ἵλεώς αὐτοῖς εἰμι
21 κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμά σου· ἀλλὰ ζῶ ἐγὼ καὶ ζῶν τὸ ὄνομά μου, καὶ ἐμπλήσει
22 ἡ δόξα Κυρίου πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν· ὅτι πάντες οἱ ἄνδρες οἱ ὁρῶντες τὴν δόξαν μου
    καὶ τὰ σημεία μου, ἃ ἐποίησα ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ καὶ ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ ταύτῃ,
    καὶ ἐπείρασάν με τοῦτο δέκατον,
23 καὶ οὐκ εἰσήκουσαν τῆς φωνῆς μου, ἢ μὴν (οὐχ) ὄψονται τὴν γῆν,
    ἣν ὤμοσα τοῖς πατράσιν αὐτῶν· ἀλλ᾽ ἢ τὰ τέκνα αὐτῶν ἃ ἔστι μετ᾽ ἐμοῦ
    ὧδε, ὅσοι οὐκ οἴδασιν ἀγαθὸν ἢ κακόν, πᾶς νεώτερος ἄπειρος,
    τούτοις δώσω τὴν γῆν· πάντες δὲ οἱ παροξύνοντές με οὐκ ὄψονται αὐτήν.
24 Ὁ δὲ παῖς μου Χάλεβ, ὅτι ἐγενήθη πνεῦμα ἕτερον ἐν αὐτῷ,
    καὶ ἐπηκολούθησέ μοι, καὶ εἰσάξω αὐτὸν εἰς τὴν γῆν,
    εἰς ἣν εἰσῆλθεν ἐκεῖ, καὶ τὸ σπέρμα αὐτοῦ κληρονομήσει αὐτήν.
25 Ὁ δὲ Ἀμαληκ καὶ ὁ Χαναναῖος κατοικοῦσιν ἐν τῇ κοιλάδι·
    αὔριον ἐπιστράφητε καὶ ἀπάρατε ὑμεῖς εἰς τὴν ἔρημον,
26 ὁδὸν θάλασσαν ἐρυθράν. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν καὶ Ἀαρών, λέγων·
27 ἕως τίνος τὴν συναγωγὴν τὴν πονηρὰν ταύτην; ἃ αὐτοὶ γογγύζουσιν
    ἐναντίον μου, τὴν γόγγυσιν τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ,
28 ἣν αὐτοὶ ἐγόγγυσαν περὶ ὑμῶν, ἀκήκοα. Εἶπον αὐτοῖς· ζῶ ἐγώ,
    λέγει Κύριος· εἰ μὴ ὃν τρόπον λελαλήκατε εἰς τὰ ὦτά μου, οὕτω ποιήσω ὑμῖν.
29 Ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ ταύτῃ πεσεῖται τὰ κῶλα ὑμῶν, καὶ πᾶσα ἡ ἐπισκοπὴ ὑμῶν,
    καὶ πάντες οἱ κατηριθμημένοι ὑμῶν ἀπὸ εἰκοσαετοῦς καὶ ἐπάνω,
    ὅσοι ἐγόγγυσαν ἐπ᾽ ἐμοί.
30 Εἰ ὑμεῖς εἰσελεύσεσθε εἰς τὴν γῆν, ἐφ᾽ ἣν ἐξέτεινα τὴν χεῖρά μου,
    κατασκηνῶσαι ὑμᾶς ἐπ᾽ αὐτῆς, ἀλλ᾽ ἢ Χάλεβ Ἰεφοννῆ,
    καὶ Ἰησοῦς ὁ τοῦ Ναυῆ·
31 καὶ τὰ παιδία ὑμῶν ἃ εἴπατε, εἰς διαρπαγὴν ἔσονται,
32 εἰσάξω αὐτοὺς εἰς τὴν γῆν, καὶ κληρονομήσουσι τὴν γῆν, ἣν ὑμεῖς ἀπώσητε
    ἀπ᾽ αὐτῆς·
33 καὶ τὰ κῶλα ὑμῶν πεσεῖται ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ ταύτῃ. Οἱ δὲ υἱοὶ ὑμῶν ἔσονται
    νεμόμενοι ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ τεσσαράκοντα ἔτη, καὶ ἀνοίσουσι τὴν πορνείαν ὑμῶν,
    ἕως ἀναλωθῇ τὰ κῶλα ὑμῶν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ·
34 κατὰ τὸν ἀριθμὸν τῶν ἡμερῶν, ὅσας κατεσκέψασθε τὴν γῆν, τεσσαράκοντα
    ἡμέρας, ἡμέραν τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ, λήψεσθε τὰς ἁμαρτίας ἡμῶν τεσσαράκοντα ἔτη,
    καὶ γνώσεσθε τὸν θυμὸν τῆς ὀργῆς μου.
35 Ἐγὼ Κύριος ἐλάλησα· ἢ μὴν οὕτω ποιήσω πάσῃ τῇ συναγωγῇ τῇ πονηρᾷ
    ταύτῃ, τῇ ἐπισυνεστραμμένῃ ἐπ᾽ ἐμέ· ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ ταύτῃ ἐξαναλωθήσονται,
    καὶ ἐκεῖ ἀποθανοῦνται,
36 καὶ οἱ ἄνθρωποι, οὓς ἀπέστειλε Μωυσῆς κατασκέψασθαι τὴν

CHAPTER 14

**20** The Lord then spoke unto Moses, saying: "I am merciful unto them according to thy word.
**21** But, as I live, and as My Name liveth, the glory of the Lord shall fill all the earth.
**22** For all the men who have seen My glory and My signs, which I did in Egypt and in this wilderness, and who have tempted Me this tenth time,
**23** and have not hearkened unto My voice, verily they shall (not) behold the land which I swore unto their fathers. But only their children, who are with Me here, as many as know not good or evil, every youth unversed [in the world's ways], to these will I give the land; but all they who have provoked Me shall not behold it.
**24** But My servant Caleb, because another spirit was within him, and he hath followed Me fully, him will I bring into the land whither he went, and his seed shall inherit it.
**25** Now the Amalekite and the Canaanite dwell in the plain; tomorrow, turn ye back and depart into the wilderness, by the way of the Red Sea."

**26** And the Lord spoke unto Moses and Aaron, saying:
**27** "How long shall [I endure] this wicked congregation? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against Me, and which they murmured against you.
**28** Say unto them, 'As I live, saith the Lord, surely as ye have spoken in My ears, so will I do unto you.
**29** In this wilderness shall your fallen bodies fall, and all your numbered company, and all those of you who were mustered, from twenty years old and upward, who murmured against Me.
**30** Verily, ye shall not enter into the land, concerning which I lifted up My hand to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.
**31** But your children, whom ye said should be a prey, them will I bring into the land, and they shall possess the land which ye have rejected from it.
**32** And your fallen bodies shall fall in this wilderness.
**33** And your sons shall be shepherds in the wilderness forty years, and they shall bear your faithlessness, until your fallen bodies be consumed in the wilderness.
**34** According to the number of the days in which ye spied out the land, even forty days—for each day a year—shall ye bear your iniquities forty years, and ye shall know the fury of My wrath.
**35** I, the Lord, have spoken: Verily, so will I do unto all this wicked congregation, which is gathered together against Me. In this wilderness shall they be utterly consumed, and there shall they die.
**36** And the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land—
