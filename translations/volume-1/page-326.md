νομίας αὐτοῦ, ἣν ἔδωκε Κύριος αὐτοῖς. Νῦν οὖν ἀνάστητε ὑμεῖς 13
καὶ παραπορεύεσθε τὴν φάραγγα Ζαρέτ· καὶ παρήλθομεν τὴν φά-
ραγγα Ζαρέτ. Καὶ αἱ ἡμέραι ἃς παρεπορεύθημεν ἀπὸ Κάδης 14
Βαρνὴ ἕως οὗ παρήλθομεν τὴν φάραγγα Ζαρέτ, τριάκοντα καὶ ὀκτὼ
ἔτη, ἕως οὗ διέπεσε πᾶσα ἡ γενεὰ ἀνδρῶν πολεμιστῶν (ἀποθνή-
σκοντες) ἐκ μέσου τῆς παρεμβολῆς, καθότι ὤμοσε Κύριος αὐτοῖς.
Καὶ ἡ χεὶρ Κυρίου ἦν ἐπ᾿ αὐτοῖς, τοῦ ἐξαναλῶσαι αὐτοὺς ἐκ μέ- 15
σου τῆς παρεμβολῆς, ἕως οὗ διέπεσαν. Καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐπειδὴ ἐπε- 16
σαν πάντες οἱ ἄνδρες οἱ πολεμισταὶ ἀποθνήσκοντες ἐκ μέσου τοῦ
λαοῦ, 17 καὶ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς μέ, λέγων· σὺ παραπορεύῃ σή- 18
μερον τὰ ὅρια Μωὰβ τὴν Ἀροήρ, καὶ προσάξετε ἐγγὺς υἱῶν Ἀμ- 19
μών· μὴ ἐχθραίνετε αὐτοῖς, καὶ μὴ συνάψητε αὐτοῖς εἰς πόλεμον·
οὐ γάρ μὴ δῶ ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς υἱῶν Ἀμμὰν σοι ἐν κλήρῳ, ὅτι τοῖς
υἱοῖς Λὼτ δέδωκα αὐτὴν ἐν κλήρῳ. Γῆ Ῥαφαεὶμ λογισθήσεται· 20
καὶ γὰρ ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς οἱ Ῥαφαεὶμ κατῴκουν τοπρότερον, καὶ οἱ Ἀμ-
μανῖται ἐπονομάζουσιν αὐτοὺς Ζομζομείν. Ἔθνος μέγα καὶ πολὺ 21
καὶ δυνατώτερον, ὥσπερ οἱ Ἐνακείμ· καὶ ἀπώλεσεν αὐτοὺς Κύ-
ριος ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτῶν, καὶ κατεκληρονόμησαν αὐτούς, καὶ
κατῳκίσθησαν ἀντ᾿ αὐτῶν (ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης)· ὥσπερ ἐποίη- 22
σε τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἡσαῦ τοῖς κατοικοῦσιν ἐν Σηείρ, ὃν τρόπον ἐξέτρι-
ψε τὸν Χορραῖον ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτῶν, καὶ κατεκληρονόμησαν αὐ-
τούς, καὶ κατῳκίσθησαν ἀντ᾿ αὐτῶν ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης. Καὶ 23
οἱ Εὐαῖοι οἱ κατοικοῦντες ἐν Ἀσηρὼθ ἕως Γάζης, καὶ οἱ Καπ-
πάδοκες οἱ ἐξελθόντες ἐκ Καππαδοκίας ἐξέτριψαν αὐτούς, καὶ κατ-
ῳκίσθησαν ἀντ᾿ αὐτῶν. Νῦν ἀνάστητε καὶ ἀπάρατε, καὶ παρέλ- 24
θατε ὑμεῖς τὴν φάραγγα Ἀρνών. Ἰδοὺ παραδέδωκα εἰς τὰς χει-
ρὰς σου τὸν Σηὼν βασιλέα Ἑσεβὼν τὸν Ἀμορραῖον, καὶ τὴν γῆν
αὐτοῦ· ἐνάρχου κληρονομεῖν, σύναπτε πρὸς αὐτὸν πόλεμον. Ἐν τῇ 25
ἡμέρα ταύτη ἐνάρχου δοῦναι τὸν τρόμον σου καὶ τὸν φόβον σου ἐπὶ
πρόσωπον πάντων τῶν ἐθνῶν τῶν ὑποκάτω παντὸς τοῦ οὐρανοῦ,
οἵτινες ἀκούσαντες τὸ ὄνομά σου παραχθήσονται, καὶ ὠδῖνας ἐξου-
σιν ἀπὸ προσώπου σου. Καὶ ἀπέστειλα πρέσβεις ἐκ τῆς ἐρή- 26
μου Κεδμὼθ πρὸς Σηὼν βασιλέα Ἑσεβὼν λόγοις εἰρηνικοῖς, λέ-
γων· παρελεύσομαι, διὰ τῆς γῆς σου, ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ πορεύσομαι, οὐκ ἐκκλι- 27
νῶ δεξιὰ οὔτε ἀριστερά· βρώματα ἀργυρίου ἀποδόσῃ μοι, καὶ φάγομαι, 28
καὶ ὕδωρ ἀργυρίου ἀποδόσῃ μοι, καὶ πίομαι· πλὴν ὅτι παρελεύσομαι:

### DEUTERONOMY CHAPTER 2

13 his law, which the LORD had given unto them. Now therefore, arise ye, and pass ye through the Valley of Zared. And we passed through the Valley of Zared.

14 And the days which we journeyed from Kadesh Barnea, until we had passed through the Valley of Zared, were thirty-eight years; until all the generation of the men of war (dying) had perished from the midst of the camp, even as the LORD had sworn unto them.

15 And the hand of the LORD was upon them, to consume them from the midst of the camp, until they had all perished.

16 And it came to pass, when all the men of war were dying from the midst of the people,

17 and the LORD spoke unto me, saying,

18 “You shall pass by the borders of Moab this day, even Aroer.

19 And you shall draw nigh unto the children of Ammon; you shall not molest them, neither shall you join battle with them: for I shall not give you of the land of the children of Ammon for an inheritance, because I have given it unto the children of Lot for an inheritance.

20 “It shall be reckoned a land of Rephaim; for upon it the Rephaim dwelt aforetime, and the Ammonites call them Zumzommim:

21 a people great and numerous and stronger, like the Anakim; and the LORD destroyed them from before their face, and they inherited them, and dwelt in their stead (even unto this day).

22 Even as He did unto the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir, in what manner He blotted out the Horite from before their face; and they inherited them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day.

23 And the Hivites, who dwell in Asheroth even unto Gaza, and the Cappadocians, who came forth from Cappadocia, utterly destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.

24 “Now arise you, and depart, and pass you through the Valley of Arnon. Behold, I have delivered into your hands Sihon, the king of Heshbon, the Amorite, and his land; begin you to inherit [it], join battle with him.

25 This day shall you begin to place your terror and your fear upon the face of all the nations that are under the whole heaven, who, hearing your name, shall be dismayed, and shall have pangs from before your face.”

26 And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon, the king of Heshbon, with words of peace, saying,

27 “I shall pass through your land: I shall go along the highway; I shall not turn aside to the right hand nor to the left.

28 For silver shall you give me food, that I may eat, and for silver shall you give me water, that I may drink; only I will pass through:
