**20** γυνὴ αὐτοῦ ἐθεώρουν. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἀναβῆναι τὴν φλόγα ἐπάνωθεν
τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν, καὶ ἀνέβη ὁ ἄγγελος Κυρίου ἐν τῇ
φλογὶ τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου (εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν)· καὶ Μανωὲ καὶ ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ
**21** ἐθεώρουν, καὶ ἔπεσον ἐπὶ πρόσωπον αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν. Καὶ οὐ προσέθηκεν
ἔτι ὁ ἄγγελος Κυρίου ὀφθῆναι πρὸς Μανωὲ καὶ πρὸς τὴν γυναῖκα
**22** αὐτοῦ· τότε ἔγνω Μανωέ, ὅτι ἄγγελος Κυρίου ἐστί. Καὶ εἶπε
Μανωὲ πρὸς τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ· θανάτῳ ἀποθανούμεθα, ὅτι
**23** Θεὸν ἑωράκαμεν. Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ· εἰ οὖν βούλεται
Κύριος θανατῶσαι ἡμᾶς, οὐκ ἂν ἐδέξατο ἐκ τῶν χειρῶν ἡμῶν
ὁλοκαύτωμα καὶ θυσίαν, καὶ οὐκ ἂν ἐφώτισεν ἡμᾶς πάντα
ταῦτα, καὶ καθὼς ὁ καιρός, οὐκ ἂν ἀκουστὰ ἐποίησεν ἡμῖν ταῦτα.
**24** Καὶ ἔτεκεν ἡ γυνὴ υἱόν, καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ, Σαμψών·
**25** καὶ ηὐλόγησεν αὐτὸν Κύριος, καὶ ηὐξήθη τὸ παιδάριον. Καὶ ἤρξατο
τὸ πνεῦμα Κυρίου συμπορεύεσθαι αὐτῷ ἐν παρεμβολῇ Δὰν ἀναμέσον
Σαρὰ καὶ ἀναμέσον Ἐσθαόλ.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΔʹ. XIV.

**1** ΚΑΙ κατέβη Σαμψὼν εἰς Θαμναθά, καὶ εἶδε γυναῖκα ἐν Θαμναθὰ
ἐκ τῶν θυγατέρων τῶν ἀλλοφύλων· καὶ ἤρεσεν ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ.
**2** Καὶ ἀνέβη, καὶ ἀπήγγειλε τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ,
καὶ εἶπε· γυναῖκα ἑώρακα ἐν Θαμναθὰ ἀπὸ τῶν θυγατέρων τῶν ἀλλοφύλων·
καὶ νῦν λάβετέ μοι αὐτὴν εἰς γυναῖκα.
**3** Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἡ μήτηρ αὐτοῦ· μὴ οὐκ ἔστιν
ἀπὸ τῶν θυγατέρων τῶν ἀδελφῶν σου καὶ ἐν παντὶ τῷ λαῷ μου
γυνή, ὅτι σὺ πορεύῃ λαβεῖν γυναῖκα ἐκ τῶν ἀλλοφύλων τῶν ἀπεριτμήτων;
Καὶ εἶπε Σαμψὼν πρὸς τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ· ταύτην λάβε
μοι, ὅτι αὕτη ἤρεσεν ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς μου.
**4** Καὶ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἡ μήτηρ αὐτοῦ οὐκ ἔγνωσαν ὅτι παρὰ
Κυρίου ἐστίν, ὅτι ἀνταπόδομα αὐτὸς ἐκζητεῖ ἐκ τῶν ἀλλοφύλων· καὶ
ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ ἀλλόφυλοι ἐκυρίευον τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ.
**5** Καὶ κατέβη Σαμψὼν καὶ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἡ μήτηρ αὐτοῦ εἰς
Θαμναθά· καὶ ἐξέκλινεν εἰς ἀμπελῶνα Θαμναθά, καὶ ἰδοὺ σκύμνος
λεόντων ὠρυόμενος εἰς ἀπάντησιν αὐτοῦ.
**6** Καὶ κατηύθυνεν ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸν πνεῦμα Κυρίου, καὶ διέσπασεν αὐτὸν
ὡσεὶ διασπάσαι ἔριφον αἰγῶν, καὶ οὐδὲν ἦν ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ· καὶ
οὐκ ἀπήγγειλε τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ

### Judges Chapter 13

**20.** his wife did look on. And it came to pass, when the flame ascended from off the altar into the heaven, that the angel of the Lord ascended in the flame of the altar (into the heaven). And Manoah and his wife did look on, and they fell upon their faces to the ground.

**21.** And the angel of the Lord did no more appear unto Manoah, nor unto his wife.

**22.** Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the Lord. And Manoah said unto his wife, "We shall surely die, for we have seen God."

**23.** But his wife said unto him, "If the Lord were pleased to kill us, He would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would He have shown us all these things, nor would He, as at this time, have made these things to be heard by us."

**24.** And the woman bore a son, and she called his name Samson.

**25.** And the Lord blessed him, and the child grew. And the Spirit of the Lord began to move with him in the camp of Dan, between Zorah and between Eshtaol.

### Judges Chapter 14

**1.** And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines; and she was pleasing in his eyes.

**2.** And he went up, and told his father and his mother, and said, "I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines; now therefore get her for me to wife."

**3.** Then his father and his mother said unto him, "Is there no woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines?" And Samson said unto his father, "Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well."

**4.** But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the Lord, for He sought an occasion for requital from the Philistines. And at that time the Philistines held dominion over the sons of Israel.

**5.** Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath; and behold, a young lion roared against him.

**6.** And the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him, and he tore it as one would tear a kid of the goats, though there was nothing in his hand. But he did not tell his father
