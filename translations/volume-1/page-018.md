ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ 3
μον σπεῖρον σπέρμα, ὅ ἐστιν ἐπάνω πάσης τῆς γῆς, καὶ πᾶν ξύ-
λον, ὃ ἔχει ἐν ἑαυτῷ καρπὸν σπέρματος σπορίμου, ὑμῖν ἔσται
εἰς βρῶσιν· καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς θηρίοις τῆς γῆς, καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς πετει- 30
νοῖς τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ παντὶ ἑρπετῷ τῷ ἕρποντι ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, ὃ
ἔχει ἐν ἑαυτῷ ψυχὴν ζωῆς, (καὶ) πάντα χόρτον χλωρὸν εἰς βρῶ-
σιν· καὶ ἐγένετο οὕτως. Καὶ ἴδεν ὁ Θεὸς τὰ πάντα, ὅσα ἐποίη- 31
σε, καὶ ἰδοὺ καλὰ λίαν. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἑσπέρα, καὶ ἐγένετο πρωΐ,
ἡμέρα ἕκτη.

ΚΕΦ. Β΄. ΙΙ.

ΚΑΙ συνετελέσθησαν ὁ οὐρανὸς καὶ ἡ γῆ, καὶ πᾶς ὁ κόσμος 1
αὐτῶν. Καὶ συνετέλεσεν ὁ Θεὸς ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἕκτῃ τὰ ἔργα 2
αὐτοῦ, ἃ ἐποίησε· καὶ κατέπαυσε τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ ἀπὸ πάν-
των τῶν ἔργων αὐτοῦ, ὧν ἐποίησε. Καὶ ηὐλόγησεν ὁ Θεὸς τὴν 3
ἡμέραν τὴν ἑβδόμην, καὶ ἡγίασεν αὐτήν· ὅτι ἐν αὐτῇ κατέπαυσεν
ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν ἔργων αὐτοῦ, ὧν ἤρξατο ὁ Θεὸς ποιῆσαι. Αὕ- 4
τη ἡ βίβλος γενέσεως οὐρανοῦ καὶ γῆς, ὅτε ἐγένετο, ᾗ ἡμέρᾳ
ἐποίησε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ τὴν γῆν, καὶ πᾶν χλω- 5
ρὸν ἀγροῦ πρὸ τοῦ γενέσθαι ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, καὶ πάντα χόρτον ἀ-
γροῦ πρὸ τοῦ ἀνατεῖλαι· οὐ γὰρ ἔβρεξε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἐπὶ τὴν
γῆν, καὶ ἄνθρωπος οὐκ ἦν ἐργάζεσθαι τὴν γῆν. Πηγὴ δὲ ἀνέ- 6
βαινεν ἐκ τῆς γῆς καὶ ἐπότιζε πᾶν τὸ πρόσωπον τῆς γῆς. Καὶ 7
ἔπλασεν ὁ Θεὸς τὸν ἄνθρωπον, χοῦν ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἐνεφύ-
σησεν εἰς τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ πνοὴν ζωῆς· καὶ ἐγένετο ὁ ἄνθρω-
πος εἰς ψυχὴν ζῶσαν. Καὶ ἐφύτευσε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς παράδεισον 8
ἐν Ἐδὲν κατὰ ἀνατολάς, καὶ ἔθετο ἐκεῖ τὸν ἄνθρωπον, ὃν ἔπλα-
σε. Καὶ ἐξανέτειλεν ὁ Θεὸς ἔτι ἐκ τῆς γῆς πᾶν ξύλον ὡραῖον 9
εἰς ὅρασιν καὶ καλὸν εἰς βρῶσιν, καὶ τὸ ξύλον τῆς ζωῆς ἐν μέ-
σῳ τοῦ παραδείσου καὶ τὸ ξύλον τοῦ εἰδέναι γνωστὸν καλοῦ καὶ
πονηροῦ. Ποταμὸς δὲ ἐκπορεύεται ἐξ Ἐδὲν, ποτίζειν τὸν παρά- 10
δεισον· ἐκεῖθεν ἀφορίζεται εἰς τέσσαρας ἀρχάς. Ὄνομα τῷ ἑνί, 11
Φεισών· οὗτος ὁ κυκλῶν πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν Εὐειλάτ, ἐκεῖ οὗ ἐστι
τὸ χρυσίον· τὸ δὲ χρυσίον τῆς γῆς ἐκείνης καλόν· καὶ ἐκεῖ ἐστιν 12
ὁ ἄνθραξ καὶ ὁ λίθος ὁ πράσινος. Καὶ ὄνομα τῷ ποταμῷ τῷ 13
δευτέρῳ, Γηῶν· οὗτος ὁ κυκλῶν πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν Αἰθιοπίας. Καὶ 14
ὁ ποταμὸς ὁ τρίτος, Τίγρις· οὗτος ὁ πορευόμενος κατέναντι Ἀσ-

**English Translation:**

**CHAPTER 1**

29 Seed-sowing seed, which is upon all the earth; and every tree which hath in itself fruit of seed that is sown, it shall be for you as food.
30 And to all the beasts of the earth, and to all the fowls of the heaven, and to every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, which hath in itself a living soul—yea, every green herb [shall be] for food.
31 And it was so. And God saw all things whatsoever He had made, and behold, they were exceeding good. And there was evening, and there was morning, the sixth day.

**CHAPTER 2**

1 Thus the heaven and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
2 And God finished His works on the sixth day, which He had made; and He rested on the seventh day from all His works which He had made.
3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because in it He rested from all His works, which God had begun to make.
4 These are the generations of the heaven and of the earth, when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the heaven and the earth,
5 And every green thing of the field before it was upon the earth, and every herb of the field before it sprang up: for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, neither was there a man to till the ground.
6 But a spring came up from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
7 And God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his face the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
8 And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there He put the man whom He had formed.
9 And God made to spring forth yet out of the ground every tree beautiful to behold and good for food, and the tree of life in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowing [that which is] known of good and evil.
10 Now a river went forth from Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was divided into four heads.
11 The name of the one is Pishon: this is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;
12 And the gold of that land is good: there is the carbuncle and the green stone.
13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.
14 And the third river is Tigris: this is it which goeth over against Assyria.
