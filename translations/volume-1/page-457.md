**12.** Μαδιάμ, τὸν Ζεβεὲ καὶ τὸν Σαλμανά, καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν παρεμβολὴν αὐτῶν ἐξέτριψε.
**13.** Καὶ ἀνέστρεψε Γεδεὼν υἱὸς Ἰωὰς ἐκ τοῦ πολέμου ἀπὸ ἀναβάσεως Ἀρές.
**14.** Καὶ συνέλαβεν παιδάριον ἐκ τῶν ἀνδρῶν Σοκχώθ, καὶ ἐπηρώτησεν αὐτόν· καὶ ἀπεγράψατο πρὸς αὐτὸν τοὺς ἄρχοντας Σοκχώθ καὶ τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους αὐτῆς, ἑβδομήκοντα ἑπτὰ ἄνδρας.
**15.** Καὶ παρεγένετο Γεδεὼν πρὸς τοὺς ἄρχοντας Σοκχώθ, (καὶ εἰσῆλθε πρὸς τοὺς ἄρχοντας Σοκχώθ,) καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· Ἰδοὺ Ζεβεὲ καὶ Σαλμανά, δι᾿ οὓς ὠνειδίσατέ με, λέγοντες· μὴ χεὶρ Ζεβεὲ καὶ Σαλμανὰ νῦν ἐν τῇ χειρί σου, ὅτι δώσομεν τοῖς ἀνδράσι σου τοῖς ἐκλελυμένοις ἄρτους;
**16.** Καὶ ἔλαβε τοὺς ἄρχοντας καὶ τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους τῆς πόλεως, καὶ κατέξανεν αὐτοὺς ἐν ταῖς ἀκάνθαις τῆς ἐρήμου καὶ ταῖς Βαρκοννείμ, καὶ κατέξανεν ἐν αὐτοῖς ἄνδρας Σοκχώθ.
**17.** Καὶ τὸν πύργον Φανουὴλ κατέσκαψε, καὶ ἀπέκτεινε τοὺς ἄνδρας τῆς πόλεως.
**18.** Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς Ζεβεὲ καὶ Σαλμανά· ποῦ οἱ ἄνδρες, οὓς ἀπεκτείνατε ἐν Θαβώρ; Καὶ εἶπαν· (ὡσεὶ σὺ) ὅμοιός σοι, ὅμοιος αὐτῶν, εἷς ὡς εἶδος (μορφὴ) υἱῶν βασιλέων.
**19.** Καὶ εἶπε Γεδεών· ἀδελφοί μου καὶ υἱοὶ τῆς μητρός μου εἰσί. Καὶ ὤμοσεν αὐτοῖς· Ζῇ Κύριος, εἰ ἐζωογονήσατε αὐτούς, οὐκ ἂν ἀπέκτεινα ὑμᾶς.
**20.** Καὶ εἶπε τῷ Ἰεθὲρ τῷ πρωτοτόκῳ αὐτοῦ· ἀναβάς, ἀπόκτεινον αὐτούς. Καὶ οὐκ ἔσπασε τὸ παιδάριον αὐτοῦ τὴν μάχαιραν αὐτοῦ·
**21.** ὅτι ἐφοβήθη, ὅτι ἔτι ἦν νεώτερος. Καὶ εἶπε Ζεβεὲ καὶ Σαλμανά· ἀνάστα δὴ σύ, καὶ ἀπάντησον ἡμῖν· ἔτι ὡς ἀνὴρ ἡ δύναμις αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἀνέστη Γεδεών, καὶ ἀνεῖλε τὸν Ζεβεὲ καὶ τὸν Σαλμανά· καὶ ἔλαβε τοὺς μηνίσκους τοὺς ἐν τοῖς τραχήλοις τῶν καμήλων αὐτῶν.
**22.** Καὶ εἶπεν ἀνὴρ Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς Γεδεών· ἄρχε ἐν ἡμῖν σύ, καὶ οἱ υἱοί σου, καὶ ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ υἱοῦ σου, ὅτι σέσωκκας ἡμᾶς ἐκ χειρὸς Μαδιάμ.
**23.** Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτοὺς Γεδεών· οὐχ ἄρξω ἐγὼ ὑμῶν, καὶ οὐκ ἄρξει ὁ υἱός μου ὑμῶν· Κύριος ἄρξει ὑμῶν.
**24.** Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτοὺς Γεδεών· αἰτήσομαι παρ᾿ ὑμῶν αἴτησιν, καὶ δότε μοι ἀνὴρ ἐνώτιον τῶν σκύλων αὐτοῦ· ὅτι ἐνώτια χρυσᾶ πολλὰ ἦν αὐτοῖς, ὅτι Ἰσμαηλῖται ἦσαν.
**25.** Καὶ εἶπαν· δεδόντες δώσομεν. Καὶ ἀνέπτυξε τὸ ἱμάτιον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐξέθηκεν ἐκεῖ ἀνὴρ ἐνώτιον χρυσοῦν τῶν σκύλων αὐτοῦ.
**26.** Καὶ ἐγενήθη ὁ σταθμὸς τῶν ἐνωτίων τῶν χρυσῶν ὧν ᾐτήσατο, σίκλοι χίλιοι καὶ ἑπτακόσιοι χρυσοῦ, πλὴν τῶν σιρώνων καὶ τῶν (ὁρμίσκων) Ἐνφώθ, καὶ τῶν περιβολαίων τῶν πορφυρῶν τῶν ἐπὶ τοῖς βασιλεῦσι Μαδιάμ,

**JUDGES**
**CHAPTER 8.**

**12.** Midian, even Zebah and Zalmunna, and all their host did he utterly destroy.
**13.** And Gideon, the son of Joash, returned from the battle, from the ascent of Heres.
**14.** And he laid hold upon a youth of the men of Succoth, and questioned him; and he wrote down unto him the princes of Succoth and the elders thereof, seventy and seven men.
**15.** And Gideon came unto the princes of Succoth, (yea, and he entered in unto the princes of Succoth,) and said unto them, "Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, concerning whom ye did reproach me, saying, 'Is the hand of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand, that we should give bread unto thy men that are faint?'"
**16.** And he took the princes and the elders of the city, and did tear their flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with the Barkonneim [briers], and with them did he likewise tear the men of Succoth.
**17.** And the tower of Penuel he did demolish, and he slew the men of the city.
**18.** And he said unto Zebah and Zalmunna, "Where are the men that ye slew in Tabor?" And they answered, "(As thou art,) like unto thee, like unto them, each one as the very aspect (yea, the form) of the sons of kings."
**19.** And Gideon said, "My brethren and the sons of my mother are they." And he swore unto them, "As the LORD liveth, if ye had saved their lives, then would I not slay you."
**20.** And he said unto Jether, his firstborn, "Arise now, and slay them." But the youth drew not his sword;
**21.** for he feared, because he was yet young. And Zebah and Zalmunna said, "Rise thou, we pray, and fall upon us; for as a man's strength, so is thine own." And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna; and he took the crescents that were on the necks of their camels.
**22.** Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, "Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy sons, and thy son's son, for thou hast saved us from the hand of Midian."
**23.** And Gideon said unto them, "I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you; the LORD shall rule over you."
**24.** And Gideon said unto them, "A request will I ask of you; give me ye every man the earring of his spoil; for they had many golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites."
**25.** And they answered, "We will surely give." And he spread out his cloak, and every man cast therein a golden earring of his spoil.
**26.** And the weight of the golden earrings which he had requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold, beside the chains and the [necklaces] (Enfoth), and the purple cloaks that were on the kings of Midian,
