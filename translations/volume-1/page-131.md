11 ἀπ᾽ αὐτοῦ ἕως πρωΐ, ἐν πυρὶ κατακαύσετε. Οὕτω δὲ φάγεσθε αὐτὸ· αἱ ὀσφύες ὑμῶν περιεζωσμέναι, καὶ τὰ ὑποδήματα ὑμῶν ἐν τοῖς ποσὶν ὑμῶν, καὶ αἱ βακτηρίαι ὑμῶν ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν ὑμῶν,
12 καὶ ἔδεσθε αὐτὸ μετὰ σπουδῆς· πάσχα ἐστι Κυρίῳ. Καὶ διελεύσομαι ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ ἐν τῇ νυκτὶ ταύτῃ, καὶ πατάξω πᾶν πρωτότοκον ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ ἀπὸ ἀνθρώπου ἕως κτήνους, καὶ ἐν πᾶσι Θεοῖς Αἰγυπτίων ποιήσω τὴν ἐκδίκησιν· ἐγὼ Κύριος.
13 Καὶ ἔσται τὸ αἷμα ὑμῖν ἐν σημείῳ ἐπὶ τῶν οἰκιῶν, ἐν αἷς ὑμεῖς κατοικεῖτε ἐκεῖ· καὶ ὄψομαι τὸ αἷμα, καὶ σκεπάσω ὑμᾶς, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ἐν ὑμῖν πληγὴ τοῦ ἐκτριβῆναι, ὅταν παίω ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ.
14 Καὶ ἔσται ἡ ἡμέρα αὕτη ὑμῖν μνημόσυνον, καὶ ἑορτάσετε αὐτὴν ἑορτὴν Κυρίῳ εἰς τὰς γενεὰς ὑμῶν· νόμιμον αἰώνιον ἑορτάσετε αὐτήν.
15 Ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας ἄζυμα ἔδεσθε, ἀπὸ δὲ τῆς πρώτης ἡμέρας ἀφανιεῖτε ζύμην ἐκ τῶν οἰκιῶν ὑμῶν· πᾶς ὃς ἂν φάγῃ ζύμην, ἐξολοθρευθήσεται ἡ ψυχὴ ἐκείνη ἐξ Ἰσραήλ, ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέρας τῆς πρώτης ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας τῆς ἑβδόμης.
16 Καὶ ἡ ἡμέρα ἡ πρώτη κεκλήσεται ἁγία, καὶ ἡ ἡμέρα ἡ ἑβδόμη κλητὴ ἁγία ἔσται ὑμῖν· πᾶν ἔργον λατρευτὸν οὐ ποιήσετε ἐν αὐταῖς, πλὴν ὅσα ποιήσεται πάσῃ ψυχῇ, τοῦτο μόνον ποιηθήσεται ὑμῖν.
17 Καὶ φυλάξετε τὴν ἐντολὴν ταύτην· ἐν γὰρ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ταύτῃ ἐξάξω τὴν δύναμιν ὑμῶν ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου· καὶ ποιήσετε τὴν ἡμέραν ταύτην εἰς γενεὰς ὑμῶν, νόμιμον αἰώνιον (εἰς τὰς γενεὰς ὑμῶν).
18 Ἐναρχομένη τῇ τεσσαρεσκαιδεκάτῃ ἡμέρᾳ τοῦ μηνὸς τοῦ πρώτου, ἀφ᾽ ἑσπέρας ἔδεσθε ἄζυμα ἕως ἡμέρας μιᾶς καὶ εἰκάδος τοῦ μηνός, ἑσπέρας.
19 Ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας ζύμη οὐχ εὑρεθήσεται ἐν ταῖς οἰκίαις ὑμῶν· πᾶς ὃς ἂν φάγῃ ζυμωτόν, ἐξολοθρευθήσεται ἡ ψυχὴ ἐκείνη ἐκ συναγωγῆς Ἰσραήλ,
20 ἔν τε τοῖς γειώρας, καὶ ἐν τοῖς αὐτόχθοσι τῆς γῆς· πᾶν ζυμωτὸν οὐκ ἔδεσθε, ἐν παντὶ κατοικητηρίῳ ὑμῶν ἔδεσθε ἄζυμα.
21 Ἐκάλεσε δὲ Μωυσῆς πᾶσαν γερουσίαν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτούς· ἀπελθόντες λάβετε ὑμῖν αὐτοῖς πρόβατον κατὰ συγγενείας ὑμῶν, καὶ θύσατε τὸ πάσχα.
22 Λήψεσθε δὲ δέσμην ὑσσώπου, καὶ βάψαντες ἀπὸ τοῦ αἵματος τοῦ παρὰ τὴν θύραν, καθίξετε ἐπὶ τῆς φλιᾶς καὶ ἐπ᾽ ἀμφοτέρων τῶν σταθμῶν ἀπὸ τοῦ αἵματος ὃ ἐστι παρὰ τὴν θύραν· ὑμεῖς δὲ οὐκ ἐξελεύσεσθε ἕκαστος τὴν θύραν τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ ἕως πρωΐ.
23 Καὶ παρελεύσεται Κύριος πατάξαι τοὺς Αἰγυπτίους, καὶ ὄψεται τὸ αἷμα ἐπὶ τῆς φλιᾶς καὶ ἐπ᾽ ἀμφοτέρων τῶν σταθμῶν ἀπὸ τοῦ αἵματος ὃ ἐστι παρὰ τὴν θύραν· ὑμεῖς δὲ οὐκ ἐξελεύσεσθε ἕκαστος τὴν θύραν τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ ἕως πρωΐ.

**EXODUS CHAPTER 12**

11 From it until the morning, ye shall burn [it] with fire. And thus shall ye eat it: with your loins girded, and your sandals upon your feet, and your staves in your hands;
12 and ye shall eat it with haste: for it is the Lord's Passover. For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from man even unto beast; and upon all the gods of the Egyptians will I execute judgment: I am the Lord.
13 And the blood shall be unto you for a sign upon the houses wherein ye dwell: and when I see the blood, I will shelter you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy [you], when I smite the land of Egypt.
14 And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast unto the Lord throughout your generations; ye shall keep it an everlasting ordinance.
15 Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; but from the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leaven, that soul shall be cut off from Israel, from the first day until the seventh day.
16 And the first day shall be called holy, and the seventh day shall be a holy convocation unto you; no servile work shall ye do therein, save that which must be prepared for every soul, that only shall be done by you.
17 And ye shall observe this ordinance; for in this selfsame day will I bring forth your hosts out of the land of Egypt: and ye shall observe this day throughout your generations, [even] an everlasting ordinance (throughout your generations).
18 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the twenty-first day of the month at evening.
19 Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses; for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel,
20 both among the sojourners, and among the natives of the land. Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread.
21 Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Go forth, and take you a lamb according to your families, and slay the Passover.
22 And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip [it] in the blood which is by the door, and apply [it] upon the lintel and on both the doorposts from the blood which is by the door; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning.
23 For the Lord will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when He seeth the blood upon the lintel and on both the doorposts, from the blood which is by the door, ye yourselves shall not go out, each one, from the door of his house until morning.
