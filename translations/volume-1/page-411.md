<sup>39</sup> περικαθίσαντες αὐτήν, ἔλαβον αὐτήν, καὶ τὸν βασιλέα αὐτῆς, καὶ τὰς πάσας κώμας αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐπάταξαν αὐτὴν ἐν στόματι ξίφους, καὶ ἐξωλόθρευσαν αὐτήν, καὶ πᾶν ἔμπνεον ἐν αὐτῇ, καὶ οὐ κατέλιπον οὐδένα διασεσωσμένον· ὃν τρόπον ἐποίησαν τῇ Χεβρὼ, οὕτως ἐποίησαν τῇ Δαβεὶρ καὶ τῷ βασιλεῖ αὐτῆς, καθάπερ ἐποίησαν τῇ Λεβνὰ καὶ τῷ βασιλεῖ αὐτῆς.
<sup>40</sup> Καὶ ἐπάταξεν Ἰησοῦς τὴν πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν τῆς ὀρεινῆς καὶ τὴν Ναγέβ, καὶ τὴν πεδινὴν, καὶ τὴν Ἀσηδὼθ, καὶ πάντας τοὺς βασιλεῖς αὐτῆς· οὐ κατέλιπον ἐν αὐτῇ διασεσωσμένον, καὶ πᾶν ἔμπνεον (ἐξ αὐτῆς) ἐξωλόθρευσαν, ὃν τρόπον ἐνετείλατο Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραήλ.
<sup>41</sup> Καὶ ἀπέκτεινεν αὐτοὺς Ἰησοῦς ἀπὸ Κάδης Βαρνὴ ἕως Γάζης, καὶ τὴν πᾶσαν (τὴν) γῆν Γοσὸμ ἕως τῆς Γαβαὼν·
<sup>42</sup> καὶ πάντας τοὺς βασιλεῖς τούτους, καὶ τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν ἔλαβεν Ἰησοῦς εἰσάπαξ· ἔτι Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραὴλ συνεπολέμει τῷ Ἰσραήλ.
<sup>43</sup> Καὶ ἀνέστρεψεν Ἰησοῦς καὶ πᾶς Ἰσραὴλ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ εἰς τὴν παρεμβολὴν εἰς Γάλγαλα.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΑʹ. XI.

<sup>1</sup> ὩΣ δὲ ἤκουσεν Ἰαβεὶς βασιλεὺς Ἀσὼρ, ἀπέστειλε πρὸς Ἰωζὰβ βασιλέα Μαδὼν, καὶ πρὸς βασιλέα Σομερὼν, καὶ πρὸς βασιλέα Ἀχσὰφ,
<sup>2</sup> καὶ πρὸς τοὺς βασιλεῖς τοὺς κατὰ Σιδῶνα τὴν μεγάλην, εἰς τὴν ὀρεινὴν, καὶ εἰς τὴν Ἄραβα ἀπέναντι Χενερέθ,
<sup>3</sup> καὶ εἰς τὸ πεδίον, καὶ εἰς Ναφεδδὼρ, καὶ εἰς τοὺς παραλίους Χαναναίους ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν, καὶ εἰς τοὺς παραλίους Ἀμοῤῥραίους, καὶ τοὺς Χετταίους, καὶ Φερεζαίους, καὶ Ἰεβουσαίους, τοὺς ἐν τῷ ὄρει, καὶ τοὺς Εὐαίους τοὺς ὑπὸ τὴν Ἀερμὼν εἰς γῆν Μασσηφάθ.
<sup>4</sup> Καὶ ἐξῆλθον αὐτοὶ καὶ οἱ βασιλεῖς αὐτῶν μετ᾿ αὐτῶν λαὸς πολὺς, ὥσπερ ἡ ἄμμος ἡ παρὰ τὸ χεῖλος τῆς θαλάσσης τῷ πλήθει, καὶ ἵπποι καὶ ἅρματα πολλὰ σφόδρα.
<sup>5</sup> Καὶ συνῆλθον πάντες οἱ βασιλεῖς οὗτοι, καὶ παρεγένοντο (πρὸς αὐτὸν,) καὶ παρενέβαλον ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ ἐπὶ τοῦ ὕδατος Μεῤῥὼμ, πολεμῆσαι τὸν Ἰσραήλ.
<sup>6</sup> Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Ἰησοῦν· μὴ φοβηθῇς ἀπὸ προσώπου αὐτῶν, ὅτι αὔριον τὴν ὥραν ταύτην ἐγὼ παραδίδωμι πάντας αὐτοὺς τετρωμένους ἐναντίον υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ· τοὺς ἵππους αὐτῶν νευροκοπήσεις, καὶ τὰ ἅρματα αὐτῶν κατακαύσεις ἐν πυρί.

**Joshua 10**

<sup>39</sup> And having encamped against it, they took it, and the king thereof, and all its villages, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed it, and every living thing therein, and left not one that was saved; after the manner as they had done unto Hebron, so they did unto Debir and unto its king, as they had done unto Libnah and unto its king.
<sup>40</sup> And Joshua smote all the land of the hill country and the Negeb, and the plain, and the Ashdoth, and all the kings thereof; they left not therein any that was saved, and every living thing (from it) they utterly destroyed, according to the manner as the Lord God of Israel had commanded.
<sup>41</sup> And Joshua smote them from Kadesh Barnea even unto Gaza, and all (the) land of Goshen even unto Gibeon;
<sup>42</sup> and all these kings, and their land, did Joshua take at one time; for the Lord God of Israel did yet fight for Israel.

<sup>4</sup> And they went out, both they and their kings with them, a great people, even as the sand that is upon the seashore in multitude, with horses and chariots a great many.
