τοῖς ἔργοις σου ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, εἰς ἣν σὺ εἰσπορεύῃ ἐκεῖ, κληρονο–

22 Θεός σου παρὰ σοῦ, καὶ ἔσται ἐν σοὶ ἁμαρτία· ἐὰν δὲ μὴ θέλῃς
23 εὔξασθαι, οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν σοὶ ἁμαρτία. Τὰ ἐκπορευόμενα διὰ τῶν
   χειλέων σου φυλάξῃ, καὶ ποιήσεις ὃν τρόπον ηὔξω Κυρίῳ τῷ
25 Θεῷ σου δόμα, ὃ ἐλάλησας τῷ στόματί σου. Ἐὰν δὲ εἰσέλθῃς
   εἰς ἀμητὸν τοῦ πλησίον σου, καὶ συνάξεις ἐν ταῖς χερσὶ σου
   στάχυς, καὶ δρέπανον οὐ μὴ ἐπιβάλῃς ἐπὶ τὸν ἀμητὸν τοῦ πλη–
24 σίον σου. Ἐὰν δὲ εἰσέλθῃς εἰς τὸν ἀμπελῶνα τοῦ πλησίον σου,
   φάγῃ σταφυλήν, ὅσον ἂν ψυχήν σου ἐμπλησθῆναι, εἰς δὲ ἄγγος
   οὐκ ἐμβαλεῖς.

1  ΕΑΝ δέ τις λάβῃ γυναῖκα, καὶ συνοικήσῃ αὐτῇ, καὶ ἔσται ἐὰν
   μὴ εὕρῃ χάριν ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ, ὅτι εὕρηκεν ἐν αὐτῇ ἄσχημον
   πρᾶγμα, καὶ γράψει αὐτῇ βιβλίον ἀποστασίου, καὶ δώσει εἰς τὰς
2  χεῖρας αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐξαποστελεῖ αὐτὴν ἐκ τῆς οἰκίας αὐτοῦ· καὶ
   ἐξέλθῃ ἐκ τῆς οἰκίας αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀπελθοῦσα γένηται ἀνδρὶ ἑτέρῳ,
   καὶ μισήσῃ αὐτὴν ὁ ἀνὴρ ὁ ἔσχατος, καὶ γράψῃ αὐτῇ βιβλίον ἀ–
   ποστασίου, καὶ δώσῃ εἰς τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐξαποστείλῃ αὐ–

   μετὰ τὸ μιανθῆναι αὐτήν, ὅτι βδέλυγμά ἐστιν ἔναντι Κυρίου τοῦ
   Θεοῦ σου· καὶ οὐ μιανεῖτε τὴν γῆν, ἣν Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν δί–

**DEUTERONOMY CHAPTER 23**

21 thy works upon the earth, into which thou art entering there, to inherit it. If thou shalt vow a vow unto the Lord thy God, thou shalt not delay to pay it; for the Lord thy God will surely require it of thee, and it shall be sin in thee.
22 But if thou forbearest to vow, it shall not be sin in thee.
23 That which hath gone out of thy lips shalt thou keep and perform, even as thou hast vowed unto the Lord thy God, [that] freewill offering which thou hast spoken with thy mouth.
24 If thou shalt enter into thy neighbour’s harvest, then thou mayest gather the ears [of corn] with thine hands; but thou shalt not lift up a sickle upon thy neighbour’s harvest.
25 If thou shalt enter into thy neighbour’s vineyard, then thou mayest eat grapes until thy soul be satisfied; but thou shalt not put [any] into a vessel.

**CHAPTER 24**

1 Now if a man take a wife, and dwell with her, and it shall come to pass, if she find no favour in his sight, because he hath found in her an unseemly thing, then he shall write her a bill of divorcement, and shall give it into her hands,
2 and shall send her out of his house; and when she is departed out of his house, and gone and become another man’s [wife],
3 and if the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of divorcement, and give it into her hands, and send her out of his house; or if the latter husband die, who had taken her unto himself as wife:
4 The former husband, who had sent her away, shall not be able, having sent her away, to return [and] take her to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is an abomination before the Lord thy God; and ye shall not defile the land, which the Lord your God giveth unto you for an inheritance.
5 If a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war, neither shall anything be imposed upon him [regarding service]; he shall be free in his house for one year, and shall cheer his wife whom he hath taken.
6 Thou shalt not take a millstone as a pledge, neither the upper millstone, for he taketh a man’s life as a pledge.
7 If a man be found stealing a soul from among his brethren of the children of Israel, and having dealt oppressively with him, he selleth him, then that thief shall die; and ye shall purge the evil one from among yourselves.
8 Take heed to thyself in the touch of leprosy; thou shalt diligently observe to do according to all the law, whatsoever
