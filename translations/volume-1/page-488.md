ΡΟΥ͂Θ.

ΚΕΦΑΛΑΙΟΝ Α΄. Ι.

**1.** ΚΑὶ ἐγένετο ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐν τῷ κρίνειν τοὺς κριτάς,
καὶ ἐγένετο λιμὸς ἐν τῇ γῇ· καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἀνὴρ ἀπὸ Βηθλέεμ τῆς
Ἰούδα, τοῦ παροικῆσαι ἐν ἀγρῷ Μωάβ, αὐτὸς καὶ ἡ γυνὴ αὐ-
τοῦ, καὶ οἱ δύο υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ. **2.** Καὶ ὄνομα τῷ ἀνδρί, ᾿Αλιμέλεχ·
καὶ ὄνομα τῇ γυναικὶ αὐτοῦ, Νοεμμείν· καὶ ὄνομα τοῖς δυσὶν υἱ-
οῖς αὐτοῦ, Μααλὼν καὶ Χελεών, ᾿Εφραθαῖοι ἐκ Βηθλέεμ τῆς ᾿Ιού-
δα. Καὶ ἦλθοσαν εἰς ἀγρὸν Μωάβ, καὶ ἦσαν ἐκεῖ. **3.** Καὶ ἀπέθα-
νεν ᾿Αλιμέλεχ ὁ ἀνὴρ τῆς Νοεμμείν, καὶ κατελείφθη αὕτη καὶ
οἱ δύο υἱοὶ αὐτῆς. **4.** Καὶ ἐλάβοσαν ἑαυτοῖς γυναῖκας Μωαβίτιδας·
ὄνομα τῇ μιᾷ, ᾿Ορφά· καὶ ὄνομα τῇ δευτέρᾳ ῾Ρούθ· καὶ κατώκη-
σαν ἐκεῖ ὡς δέκα ἔτη. **5.** Καὶ ἀπέθανον καίγε ἀμφότεροι, Μααλὼν
καὶ Χελεών· καὶ κατελείφθη ἡ γυνὴ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς αὐτῆς, καὶ
ἀπὸ τῶν δύο υἱῶν αὐτῆς. **6.** Καὶ ἀνέστη αὕτη καὶ αἱ δύο νύμφαι
αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν ἐξ ἀγροῦ Μωάβ· ἔτι ἤκουσαν ἐν ἀγρῷ
Μωὰβ ὅτι ἐπέσκεπται Κύριος τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ, δοῦναι αὐτοῖς ἄρ-
τους. **7.** Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ἐκ τοῦ τόπου οὗ ἦν ἐκεῖ, καὶ αἱ δύο νύμφαι
αὐτῆς μετ᾿ αὐτῆς· καὶ ἐπορεύοντο ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ, τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι εἰς
γῆν Ἰούδα. **8.** Καὶ εἶπε Νοεμμείν ταῖς δυσὶ νύμφαις αὐτῆς· πορεύ-
θητε δὴ, ἀποστράφητε δὴ ἑκάστη εἰς τὸν οἶκον μητρὸς αὐτῆς·
ποιήσαι Κύριος μεθ᾿ ὑμῶν ἔλεος, καθὼς ἐποιήσατε μετὰ τῶν τε-
θνηκότων καὶ μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ· **9.** δῴη Κύριος ὑμῖν, καὶ εὕροιτε ἀνάπαυσιν
ἑκάστη ἐν οἴκῳ ἀνδρὸς αὐτῆς. Καὶ κατεφίλησεν αὐτάς· καὶ ἐπῆραν
τὴν φωνὴν αὐτῶν καὶ ἔκλαυσαν. **10.** Καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῇ· οὐχί, μετὰ σοῦ
ἐπιστρέψομεν εἰς τὸν λαόν σου. **11.** Καὶ εἶπε Νοεμμείν· ἐπιστράφητε
δὴ θυγατέρες μου, (πορεύθητε,) καὶ ἱνατί πορεύεσθε μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ;
μὴ ἔτι μοι υἱοὶ ἐν τῇ κοιλίᾳ μου, καὶ ἔσονται ὑμῖν εἰς ἄνδρας;

### The Book of Ruth

### Chapter 1

**1.** And it came to pass in the days when the judges did rule, that there was a famine in the land; and a certain man from Bethlehem of Judah departed to sojourn in the country of Moab, he and his wife, and his two sons.
**2.** And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife was Naomi; and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites from Bethlehem of Judah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.
**3.** And Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died; and she was left, and her two sons.
**4.** And they took unto themselves wives of the women of Moab: the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the second was Ruth; and they dwelt there about ten years.
**5.** And moreover, they both died, Mahlon and Chilion; and the woman was left of her husband and of her two sons.
**6.** Then she arose, and her two daughters-in-law, and they returned from the country of Moab; for they had heard in the country of Moab that the Lord had visited His people, to give them bread.
**7.** And she went forth from the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they journeyed on the way, to return unto the land of Judah.
**8.** And Naomi said unto her two daughters-in-law, "Go ye, turn ye each unto her mother's house; the Lord deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead and with me.
**9.** The Lord grant you, that ye may find rest, each one in the house of her husband." And she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.
**10.** And they said unto her, "Nay, we will return with thee unto thy people."
**11.** And Naomi said, "Turn again, my daughters; (go your way;) for why will ye go with me? Are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?"
