κληρονομήσατε τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐξωλοθρεύσατε αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ προ-
σώπου ὑμῶν. Καὶ ἀνέστη Βαλὰκ ὁ τοῦ Σεπφώρ, βασιλεὺς Μωάβ, 9
καὶ παρετάξατο τῷ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἀποστείλας ἐκάλεσε τὸν Βαλαάμ,
υἱὸν Βεώρ, ἀράσασθαι ὑμῖν· καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησε Κύριος ἀπολέσαι σε, 10
καὶ εὐλογίαν εὐλόγησεν ὑμᾶς, καὶ ἐξείλατο ὑμᾶς ἐκ τῶν χειρῶν
αὐτῶν. Καὶ διέβητε τὸν Ἰορδάνην, καὶ παρεγενήθητε εἰς Ἰεριχώ· 11
καὶ ἐπολέμησαν πρὸς ὑμᾶς οἱ κατοικοῦντες Ἰεριχώ, ὁ Ἀμοῤῥαῖος,
καὶ ὁ Φερεζαῖος, καὶ ὁ Χαναναῖος, καὶ ὁ Χετταῖος, καὶ ὁ Γεργε-
σαῖος, καὶ ὁ Εὐαῖος, καὶ ὁ Ἰεβουσαῖος· καὶ παρέδωκεν αὐτοὺς εἰς
τὰς χεῖρας ὑμῶν. Καὶ ἐξαπέστειλα προτέραν ὑμῶν τὴν σφηκίαν, 12
καὶ ἐξέβαλεν αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ προσώπου ὑμῶν, δώδεκα βασιλεῖς τῶν
Ἀμοῤῥαίων, οὐκ ἐν τῇ ῥομφαίᾳ σου, οὐδὲ ἐν τῷ τόξῳ σου. Καὶ 13
ἔδωκεν ὑμῖν γῆν ἐφ᾿ ἣν οὐκ ἐκοπιάσατε ἐπ᾿ αὐτῇ, καὶ πόλεις ἃς
οὐκ ᾠκοδομήσατε, καὶ κατῳκήθητε ἐν αὐταῖς· καὶ ἀμπελῶνας καὶ
ἐλαιῶνας οὓς οὐ κατεφυτεύσατε, ὑμεῖς ἔδεσθε. Καὶ νῦν φοβήθητε 14
τὸν Κύριον, καὶ λατρεύσατε αὐτῷ ἐν δικαιοσύνῃ καὶ ἐν εὐθύτητι·
καὶ περιέλεσθε τοὺς θεοὺς τοὺς ἀλλοτρίους, οἷς ἐλάτρευσαν οἱ
πατέρες ὑμῶν ἐν τῷ πέραν τοῦ ποταμοῦ καὶ ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ, καὶ
λατρεύσατε τῷ Κυρίῳ. Εἰ δὲ μὴ ἀρέσκει ὑμῖν λατρεύειν τῷ Κυρίῳ, 15
ἕλεσθε ὑμῖν αὐτοῖς σήμερον, τίνι λατρεύσητε, εἴτε τοῖς θεοῖς τῶν
πατέρων ὑμῶν, τοῖς ἐν τῷ πέραν τοῦ ποταμοῦ, εἴτε τοῖς θεοῖς τῶν
Ἀμοῤῥαίων, ἐν οἷς ὑμεῖς κατοικεῖτε ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς αὐτῶν· ἐγὼ δὲ
καὶ ὁ οἰκός μου λατρεύσομεν Κυρίῳ, ὅτι ἅγιός ἐστι. Καὶ ἀποκρι- 16
θεὶς ὁ λαὸς εἶπε· μὴ γένοιτο ἡμῖν καταλείπειν Κύριον, ὥστε
λατρεύειν θεοῖς ἑτέροις. Κύριος γὰρ ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν ἐστιν· αὐτὸς ἀνή- 17
γαγεν ἡμᾶς καὶ τοὺς πατέρας ἡμῶν ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, ἐξ οἴκου
δούλων, καὶ ὃς ἐποίησεν ἡμῖν τὰ σημεῖα τὰ μεγάλα ταῦτα· καὶ
διεφύλαξεν ἡμᾶς ἐν πάσῃ τῇ ὁδῷ ᾗ ἐπορεύθημεν ἐν αὐτῇ, καὶ ἐν
πᾶσι τοῖς ἔθνεσιν οὓς παρήλθομεν δι᾿ αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐξέβαλε Κύριος 18
τὸν Ἀμοῤῥαῖον καὶ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη τὰ κατοικοῦντα τὴν γῆν, ἀπὸ
προσώπου ἡμῶν. Ἀλλὰ καὶ ἡμεῖς λατρεύσομεν Κυρίῳ· οὗτος γὰρ
ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν ἐστι. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἰησοῦς πρὸς τὸν λαόν· οὐ μὴ δύ- 19
νησθε λατρεύειν τῷ Κυρίῳ (τῷ Θεῷ), ὅτι Θεὸς ἅγιός ἐστι, καὶ
Θεὸς ζηλώσας οὗτος· οὐκ ἀνήσει τὰ ἁμαρτήματα ὑμῶν καὶ τὰ
ἀνομήματα ὑμῶν. Ἡνίκα ἂν ἐγκαταλίπητε τὸν Κύριον καὶ λατρεύ- 20

**Joshua 24**
<sup>8</sup> unto you; and He delivered them (the LORD) into your hands, and ye inherited their land, and ye utterly destroyed them from before your face.
<sup>9</sup> And Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and arrayed himself against Israel, and having sent [messengers], he called Balaam, the son of Beor, that he might curse you.
<sup>10</sup> But the LORD would not destroy thee; nay, He blessed you with a blessing, and delivered you out of their hands.
<sup>11</sup> And ye crossed over the Jordan, and ye came unto Jericho; and the inhabitants of Jericho fought against you—the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Girgashite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite; and He delivered them into your hands.
<sup>12</sup> And I sent the hornet before you, and it drove them out from before your face, [even] twelve kings of the Amorites; not by thy sword, nor by thy bow.
<sup>13</sup> And I gave you a land whereupon ye toiled not, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwelt in them; and vineyards and olive groves which ye planted not, ye yourselves shall eat.
<sup>14</sup> Now therefore, fear the LORD, and serve Him in righteousness and in uprightness; and put away the strange gods which your fathers served beyond the River and in Egypt, and serve the LORD.
<sup>15</sup> But if it please you not to serve the LORD, choose you this day for yourselves whom ye will serve; whether the gods of your fathers, which were beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell; but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD, for He is holy.
<sup>16</sup> And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake the LORD, to serve other gods!
<sup>17</sup> For the LORD our God is He; He it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and who did these great signs for us; and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the nations through whom we passed.
<sup>18</sup> And the LORD cast out the Amorite and all the nations that inhabited the land, from before our face. Therefore, we also will serve the LORD; for this is our God.
<sup>19</sup> And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD (God); for He is a holy God, and He is a jealous God; He will not forgive your sins nor your iniquities.
