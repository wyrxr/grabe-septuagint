σάρα πάντα τὰ ἅρματα αὐτοῦ, ὅτι ἐννακόσια ἅρματα σιδηρᾶ ἦν
αὐτῷ, καὶ πάντα τὸν λαὸν τὸν μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ, ἀπὸ Ἀρεισὼθ τῶν
ἐθνῶν εἰς τὸν χειμάῤῥουν Κισῶν. 14. Καὶ εἶπε Δεββῶρα πρὸς Βαράκ· ἀνάστηθι, ὅτι αὕτη ἡ ἡμέρα, ἐν ᾗ παραδώσει Κύριος τὸν Σι-
σάρα ἐν χειρί σου· οὐκ ἰδοὺ Κύριος ἐλεύσεται ἔμπροσθέν σου; Καὶ
κατέβη Βαρὰκ ἀπὸ τοῦ ὄρους Θαβώρ, καὶ δέκα χιλιάδες ἀνδρῶν
ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ. 15. Καὶ ἐξέστησε Κύριος τὸν Σισάρα, καὶ πάντα τὰ
ἅρματα αὐτοῦ, καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν παρεμβολὴν αὐτοῦ ἐν στόματι ῥομ-
φαίας ἐνώπιον Βαράκ· καὶ κατέβη Σισάρα ἀπὸ τοῦ ἅρματος αὐ-
τοῦ, καὶ ἔφυγε τοῖς ποσὶν αὐτοῦ. 16. Καὶ Βαρὰκ διώκων ὀπίσω τῶν
ἀρμάτων, καὶ ὀπίσω τῆς παρεμβολῆς, (καὶ) ἕως δρυμοῦ τῶν ἐθνῶν· καὶ ἔπεσε πᾶσα ἡ παρεμβολὴ Σισάρα ἐν στόματι ῥομ-
φαίας· οὐ κατελείφθη ἕως ἑνός. 17. Καὶ Σισάρα ἀνεχώρησε τοῖς πο-
σὶν αὐτοῦ εἰς σκηνὴν Ἰαήλ, γυναικὸς Χαβὲρ τοῦ Κειναίου· ὅτι
εἰρήνη ἀναμέσον Ἰαβεὶν βασιλέως Ἀσὼρ, καὶ ἀναμέσον οἴκου Χα-
βὲρ τοῦ Κειναίου. 18. Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Ἰαὴλ εἰς ἀπάντησιν Σισάρα, καὶ
εἶπε πρὸς αὐτόν· ἔκνευσον κύριέ μου ἔκνευσον πρός με, μὴ φοβοῦ. Καὶ
ἔκνευσε πρὸς αὐτὴν εἰς τὴν σκηνὴν, καὶ συνεκαλύψεν αὐτὸν ἐν τῇ δέῤῥει
αὐτῆς. 19. Καὶ εἶπε Σισάρα πρὸς αὐτήν· πότισόν με δὴ μικρὸν ὕδωρ, ὅτι ἐδίψησα. Καὶ ἤνοιξε τὸν ἀσκὸν τοῦ γάλακτος, καὶ ἐπότισεν αὐτὸν,
καὶ συνεκαλύψε τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ. 20. Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτήν· στῆθι
ἐν τῇ θύρᾳ τῆς σκηνῆς, καὶ ἔσται ἐὰν τις ἔλθῃ πρός σε, καὶ ἐ-

**CHAPTER 4.**

**13.** ...Sisera all his chariots, for nine hundred chariots of iron had he, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the torrent Kishon.
**14.** And Deborah said unto Barak, "Arise, for this is the day in which the Lord shall deliver Sisera into thine hand; behold, shall not the Lord go out before thee?" And Barak went down from Mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.

**16.** And Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, (and) even unto the wood of the Gentiles; and all the host of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; there was not left so much as one.
**17.** And Sisera fled on his feet unto the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin, king of Hazor, and between the house of Heber the Kenite.
**18.** And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, "Turn aside, my lord, turn aside unto me; fear not." And he turned aside unto her into the tent, and she covered him with her mantle.
**19.** And Sisera said unto her, "Give me now, I pray thee, a little water to drink, for I am thirsty." And she opened a skin of milk, and gave him to drink, and she covered his face.
**20.** And he said unto her, "Stand at the door of the tent, and it shall be, if any man come to thee, and ask thee, and [say, "Is there any man here?"]"
