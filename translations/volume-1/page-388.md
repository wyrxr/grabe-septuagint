ΚΕΦ. ΛΓʹ. ΔΕΥΤΕΡΟΝΟΜΙΟΝ 373
τῶν χειρῶν αὐτοῦ δέξαι· πάταξον ὀσφῦν ἐπανεστηκότων ἐχθρῶν
αὐτοῦ, καὶ οἱ μισοῦντες αὐτὸν μὴ ἀναστήτωσαν. Καὶ τῷ Βενια- 12
μεῖν εἶπεν· ἠγαπημένος ὑπὸ Κυρίου κατασκηνώσει πεποιθώς,
καὶ ὁ Θεὸς σκιάζει ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας, καὶ ἀνα-
μέσον τῶν ὤμων αὐτοῦ κατέπαυσε. Καὶ τῷ Ἰωσὴφ εἶπεν· ἀπ᾿ 13
εὐλογίας Κυρίου ἡ γῆ αὐτοῦ, ἀπὸ ὡρῶν οὐρανοῦ καὶ δρό-
σου, καὶ ἀπὸ ἀβύσσων πηγῶν κάτωθεν, καὶ καθ᾿ ὥραν γεννη- 14
μάτων ἡλίου τροπῶν, καὶ ἀπὸ συνόδων μηνῶν, καὶ ἀπὸ κο- 15
ρυφῆς ὀρέων ἀρχῆς, καὶ ἀπὸ κορυφῆς βουνῶν ἀενάων, καὶ καθ᾿ 16
ὥραν γῆς πληρώσεως· καὶ τὰ δεκτὰ τῷ ὀφθέντι ἐν τῇ βάτῳ ἐλ-
θοῦσαν ἐπὶ κεφαλὴν Ἰωσήφ, καὶ ἐπὶ κορυφῆς δοξασθεὶς ἐν ἀδελφοῖς.
Πρωτότοκος ταύρου τὸ κάλλος αὐτοῦ, καὶ κέρατα μονοκέρωτος 17
τὰ κέρατα αὐτοῦ· ἐν αὐτοῖς ἔθνη κερατιεῖ ἅμα ἕως ἀπ᾿ ἄκρου τῆς
γῆς. Αὗται μυριάδες Ἐφραίμ, καὶ αὗται χιλιάδες Μανασσῆ. Καὶ 18
τῷ Ζαβουλὼν εἶπεν· εὐφράνθητι Ζαβουλὼν ἐν ἐξοδίᾳ σου, καὶ Ἰσ-
σάχαρ ἐν τοῖς σκηνώμασιν αὐτοῦ. Ἔθνη ἐξολοθρεύσουσι· καὶ ἐπι- 19
καλέσεσθε ἐκεῖ, καὶ θύσετε ἐκεῖ θυσίαν δικαιοσύνης· ὅτι πλοῦτος
θαλάσσης θηλάσει σε, καὶ ἐμπόρια παράλιον κατοικούντων. Καὶ 20
τῷ Γὰδ εἶπεν· ηὐλογημένος ἐμπλατύνων Γάδ· ὡς λέων ἀνεπαύ-
σατο, συντρίψας βραχίονα καὶ ἄρχοντα. Καὶ εἶδεν ἀπαρχὴν αὐτοῦ, 21
ὅτι ἐκεῖ ἐμερίσθη γῆ ἀρχόντων συνηγμένων ἅμα ἀρχηγοῖς λαῶν.
Δικαιοσύνην Κύριος ἐποίησε, καὶ κρίσιν αὐτοῦ μετὰ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ 22
τῷ Δὰν εἶπε· Δὰν σκύμνος λέοντος, καὶ ἐκπηδήσει ἐκ τοῦ Βασάν.
Καὶ τῷ Νεφθαλεί εἶπε· Νεφθαλεί πλησμονὴ δεκτῶν, καὶ ἐμπλη- 23
σθήτω εὐλογίας παρὰ Κυρίου· θάλασσαν καὶ λίβα κληρονομήσει.
Καὶ τῷ Ἀσὴρ εἶπεν· ηὐλογημένος ἀπὸ τέκνων Ἀσήρ, καὶ ἔσται 24
δεκτὸς τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς αὐτοῦ· βάψει ἐν ἐλαίῳ τὸν πόδα αὐτοῦ· σί- 25
δηρος καὶ χαλκὸς τὸ ὑπόδημα αὐτοῦ ἔσται, καὶ ὡς αἱ ἡμέραι σου,
ἡ ἰσχύς σου. Οὐχ ἔστιν ὥσπερ ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ ἠγαπημένου· ὁ ἐπι- 26
βαίνων ἐπὶ τὸν οὐρανὸν βοηθός σου, καὶ ὁ μεγαλοπρεπὴς τοῦ
στερεώματος. Καὶ σκέπασις Θεοῦ ἀρχήν, καὶ ὑπὸ ἰσχὺν βραχιό- 27
νων ἀενάων· καὶ ἐκβαλεῖ ἀπὸ προσώπου σου ἐχθρόν, λέγων· ἀπό-
λοιο. Καὶ κατασκηνώσει Ἰσραὴλ μόνος πεποιθώς, πηγὴ Ἰακὼβ 28
ἐπὶ γῆς σίτου καὶ οἴνου· καὶ ὁ οὐρανὸς συννεφὴς αὐτῷ δρόσῳ. Μα- 29
κάριος σὺ Ἰσραήλ· τίς ὅμοιός σου λαός, σωζόμενος ὑπὸ Κυρίου;

**Deuteronomy 33**

11 ...of his hands accept. Smite the loins of them that rise up against him, and let not them that hate him rise again.

12 And to Benjamin he said: "The beloved of the Lord shall dwell in confidence; and God shall overshadow him all his days, and shall cause him to rest between His shoulders."

13 And to Joseph he said: "Blessed of the Lord be his land, with the [choicest] seasons of heaven, and with the dew, and from the deep springs beneath,
14 and with the choicest fruits of the sun's turnings, and from the gatherings of the months,
15 and from the top of the ancient mountains, and from the top of the everlasting hills,
16 and with the choicest fullness of the earth. And let the desirable things of Him that appeared in the bush, having come upon the head of Joseph, even upon the crown of him who was glorified among his brethren, [be his]."

17 The firstborn of the bull, his beauty [is like unto it]; and the horns of a unicorn are his horns; with them shall he gore the nations together, even unto the ends of the earth. These are the myriads of Ephraim, and these are the thousands of Manasseh.

18 And to Zebulun he said: "Rejoice, O Zebulun, in thy going out; and Issachar in his tents."

19 The nations shall they utterly destroy; and ye shall call there, and ye shall offer there a sacrifice of righteousness. For the abundance of the sea shall suckle thee, and the merchandise of them that dwell by the shore.

20 And to Gad he said: "Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad; as a lion he rested, having broken the arm and the ruler."

21 And he saw his first portion, for there was a land of rulers divided; gathered together with the chiefs of the peoples. The Lord hath done righteousness, and His judgment with Israel.

22 And to Dan he said: "Dan is a lion's cub, and he shall leap forth from Bashan."

23 And to Naphtali he said: "Naphtali, full of desirable things, and let him be filled with the blessing from the Lord; he shall inherit the sea and the south wind."

24 And to Asher he said: "Blessed among sons be Asher; and let him be acceptable to his brethren."

25 He shall dip his foot in oil; iron and bronze shall be his shoe; and as thy days, so shall thy strength be.

26 There is none like unto the God of the Beloved One; He that rideth upon the heavens is thy helper, and the Majestic One of the firmament.

27 And the covering of God [is] from the beginning, and underneath are the strength of the everlasting arms; and He shall cast out thine enemy from before thy face, saying, "Perish!"

28 And Israel shall dwell alone securely, the fountain of Jacob in a land of grain and wine; and the heaven shall be cloudy for him with dew.

29 Happy art thou, O Israel! Who is like unto thee, O people saved by the Lord?
