ΕΞΟΔΟΣ 10:7

Λέγουσι δὲ οἱ θεράποντες Φαραὼ πρὸς
αὐτόν· ἕως τίνος ἔσται ἡμῖν τοῦτο σκῶλον; ἐξαπόστειλον τοὺς ἀν-
θρώπους, ὅπως λατρεύσωσι Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ αὐτῶν· ἢ εἰδέναι βού-
λει, ἔτι ἀπόλωλεν Αἴγυπτος; Καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν τόν τε Μωυσῆν
καὶ Ἀαρὼν πρὸς Φαραώ, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς Φαραώ· πορεύεσθε, λα-
τρεύσατε Κυρίῳ τῷ Θεῷ ὑμῶν· τίνες δὲ καὶ τίνες εἰσὶν οἱ πορευό-
μενοι; Λέγει δὲ Μωυσῆς· σὺν τοῖς νεανίσκοις ἡμῶν καὶ τοῖς πρεσ-
βύταις ἡμῶν πορευσόμεθα, σὺν τοῖς υἱοῖς καὶ θυγατράσι, καὶ προβάτοις
καὶ βουσὶν ἡμῶν πορευσόμεθα· ἔστι γὰρ ἑορτὴ Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ
ἡμῖν. Καὶ εἶπε Φαραὼ πρὸς αὐτούς· ἔστω οὕτω. Κύριος μεθ’
ὑμῶν· καθότι ἀποστέλλω ὑμᾶς, μὴ καὶ τὴν ἀποσκευὴν ὑμῶν; ἴδε-
τε ὅτι πονηρία πρόκειται ὑμῖν. Μὴ οὕτως· πορευθέτωσαν δὴ οἱ
ἄνδρες, καὶ λατρεύσατε τῷ Κυρίῳ· τοῦτο γὰρ αὐτοὶ ζητεῖτε. Ἐξέ-
βαλον δὲ αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ προσώπου Φαραώ. Εἶπε δὲ Κύριος πρὸς
Μωυσῆν· ἔκτεινον τὴν χεῖρά σου ἐπὶ γῆν Αἰγύπτου, καὶ ἀναβήτω
ἀκρὶς ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν Αἰγύπτου, καὶ κατέδεται πᾶσαν βοτάνην τῆς
γῆς, καὶ πάντα τὸν καρπὸν τῶν ξύλων, ἃ ὑπελείπετο ἡ χάλαζα.
Καὶ ἐπῆρε Μωυσῆς τὴν ῥάβδον εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν, καὶ Κύριος ἐπή-
γαγεν ἄνεμον νότον ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν ἐκείνην, καὶ
ὅλην τὴν νύκτα· τὸ πρωῒ ἐγενήθη, καὶ ὁ ἄνεμος ὁ νότος ἀνέλα-
βε τὴν ἀκρίδα, καὶ ἀνήγαγεν αὐτὴν ἐπὶ πᾶσαν γῆν Αἰγύπτου, καὶ
κατέπαυσεν ἐπὶ πάντα τὰ ὅρια Αἰγύπτου πολλὴ σφόδρα· προτέρα
αὐτῆς οὐ γέγονε τοιαύτη ἀκρίς, καὶ μετ’ αὐτὴν οὐκ ἔσται οὕτως.
Καὶ ἐκάλυψε τὴν ὄψιν τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἐφθάρη ἡ γῆ· καὶ κατέφαγε
πᾶσαν βοτάνην τῆς γῆς, καὶ πάντα τὸν καρπὸν τῶν ξύλων, ὅς
ὑπελείφθη ἀπὸ τῆς χαλάζης· οὐ κατελείφθη χλωρὸν οὐδὲν ἐν τοῖς
ξύλοις, καὶ ἐν πάσῃ βοτάνῃ τοῦ πεδίου, ἐν πάσῃ γῇ Αἰγύπτου.
Κατέσπευδε δὲ Φαραὼ καλέσαι Μωυσῆν καὶ Ἀαρών, λέγων· ἥ-
μάρτηκα ἐναντίον Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ὑμῶν, καὶ εἰς ὑμᾶς· προσδέ-
ξασθε οὖν μου τὴν ἁμαρτίαν ἔτι νῦν, καὶ προσεύξασθε πρὸς Κύ-
ριον τὸν Θεὸν ὑμῶν, καὶ περιελέτω ἀπ᾿ ἐμοῦ τὸν θάνατον τοῦτον.
Ἐξῆλθε δὲ Μωυσῆς ἀπὸ Φαραώ, καὶ ηὔξατο πρὸς Κύριον·
καὶ μετέβαλε Κύριος ἀπὸ θαλάσσης ἄνεμον σφοδρόν, καὶ ἀνέλαβε
τὴν ἀκρίδα, καὶ ἐνέβαλεν αὐτὴν εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν τὴν ἐρυθράν· καὶ
οὐχ ὑπελείφθη ἀκρὶς μία ἐν πάσῃ γῇ Αἰγύπτου. Καὶ ἐσκλήρυνε
Κύριος τὴν καρδίαν Φαραώ, καὶ οὐκ ἐξαπέστειλε τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ.

### Exodus

#### Chapter 10

7 And the servants of Pharaoh said unto him:
“How long shall this thing be a snare unto us? Send forth the men,
that they may worship the LORD their God. Or dost thou still
desire to know that Egypt is [utterly] destroyed?”

8 And they brought back both Moses
and Aaron unto Pharaoh, and Pharaoh said unto them:
“Go ye, worship the LORD your God. But who, indeed,
are those that shall go?”

9 And Moses answered:
“With our young men and with our elders
shall we go forth; with our sons and with our daughters,
and with our sheep and with our cattle shall we go forth;
for it is a feast of the LORD our God for us.”

10 And Pharaoh said unto them: “So be it.
The LORD be with you! Forasmuch as I send you forth,
[do ye also presume to take] your baggage?
Behold, for evil is set before you.

11 Not so! Let the men go forth,
and worship the LORD; for this alone do ye yourselves seek.”
And they cast them out from the presence of Pharaoh.

12 And the LORD said unto Moses:
“Stretch forth thy hand over the land of Egypt,
and let the locust come up upon the land of Egypt,
and it shall devour every herb of the land,
and all the fruit of the trees, which the hail had left.”

13 And Moses lifted up his rod toward the heaven;
and the LORD did cause a south wind to come upon the land
all that day and all that night.
And when it was morning, the south wind
did bear up the locusts, and brought them upon
all the land of Egypt.

14 And they settled upon all the borders of Egypt,
exceedingly many. Before them there had been no such locusts,
nor after them shall there be such again.

15 And they covered the face of the whole land,
and the land was laid waste. And they devoured
every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees
which was left from the hail. No green thing remained
in the trees, nor in any herb of the field,
throughout all the land of Egypt.

16 And Pharaoh hastened to call Moses and Aaron, saying:
“I have sinned before the LORD your God, and against you.

17 Receive therefore my sin even now,
and pray ye unto the LORD your God,
and let Him remove from me this deadly destruction.”

18 And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and prayed unto the LORD;

19 And the LORD did turn [it to] a strong wind from the sea,
and it bore up the locusts, and cast them
into the Red Sea; and not one locust
was left in all the land of Egypt.

20 But the LORD hardened
the heart of Pharaoh, and he would not send forth the sons of Israel.
