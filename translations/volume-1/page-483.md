εἴκοσι καὶ πέντε χιλιάδες ἀνδρῶν σπωμένων ῥομφαίαν, χωρὶς τῶν
κατοικούντων τὴν Γαβαά· οὗτοι ἐπεσκέπησαν ἑπτακόσιοι ἄνδρες
16 ἐκλεκτοὶ νεανίσκοι, ἐκ παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου ἑπτακόσιοι ἄνδρες
ἐκλεκτοὶ ἀμφοτεροδέξιοι· πάντες οὗτοι σφενδονῆται βάλλοντες λί-
17 θους πρὸς τὴν τρίχα, καὶ οὐ διαμαρτάνοντες. Καὶ πᾶς ἀνὴρ
Ἰσραὴλ ἐπεσκέπησαν χωρὶς τῶν υἱῶν Βενιαμείν, τετρακόσιαι χι-
λιάδες ἀνδρῶν σπωμένων ῥομφαίαν· πάντες οὗτοι ἄνδρες πολεμι-
18 σταί. Καὶ ἀνέστησαν, καὶ ἀνέβησαν εἰς Βαιθήλ, καὶ ἐπηρώτησαν
ἐν τῷ Θεῷ, καὶ εἶπαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ· τίς ἀναβήσεται ἡμῖν ἀρ-
γούμενος πολεμῆσαι μετὰ υἱῶν Βενιαμείν; Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος· Ἰού-
19 δας ἀναβήσεται ἀφηγούμενος. Καὶ ἀνέστησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ τὸ-
20 πρωΐ, καὶ παρενέβαλον ἐπὶ τὴν Γαβαά. Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν (Ἰσραὴλ καὶ)
πᾶς ἀνὴρ Ἰσραὴλ εἰς πόλεμον μετὰ Βενιαμείν, καὶ παρετάξατο
21 μετ᾿ αὐτῶν εἰς πόλεμον ἀνὴρ Ἰσραὴλ πρὸς τὴν Γαβαά. Καὶ ἐξῆλθον οἱ
υἱοὶ Βενιαμεὶν ἐκ τῆς πόλεως, καὶ διέφθειραν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἐν Ἰ-
22 σραὴλ δύο καὶ εἴκοσι χιλιάδας ἀνδρῶν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν. Καὶ ἐνίσχυ-
σεν ὁ λαὸς ἀνὴρ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ προσέθεντο παρατάξαι πόλεμον ἐν
23 τῷ τόπῳ, ᾧ παρετάξαντο ἐκεῖ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ πρώτῃ. Καὶ ἀνέ-
βησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἔκλαυσαν ἐνώπιον Κυρίου ἕως ἑσπέρας·
καὶ ἐπηρώτησαν ἐν Κυρίῳ, λέγοντες· εἰ προσθῶ προσεγγίσαι εἰς
πόλεμον μετὰ υἱῶν Βενιαμεὶν τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ μου; Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ
24 Κύριος· ἀνάβητε πρὸς αὐτόν. Καὶ προσήλθοσαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ
25 πρὸς υἱοὺς Βενιαμεὶν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ δευτέρᾳ. Καὶ ἐξῆλθε Βε-
νιαμεὶν εἰς ἀπάντησιν αὐτῶν ἐκ τῆς Γαβαὰ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ δευ-
τέρᾳ, καὶ διέφθειραν ἔτι ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ ὀκτωκαίδεκα χιλιάδας
26 ἀνδρῶν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν· πάντες οὗτοι ἐσπασμένοι ῥομφαίαν. Καὶ
ἀνέβησαν πάντες οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαός, καὶ ἦλθοσαν
εἰς Βαιθήλ· καὶ ἔκλαυσαν, καὶ ἐκάθισαν ἐκεῖ ἔναντι Κυρίου, καὶ
ἐνήστευσαν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ ἕως ἑσπέρας, καὶ ἀνήνεγκαν ὁλο-
27 καυτώματα σωτηρίου ἔναντι Κυρίου, καὶ ἐπηρώτησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ
ἐν Κυρίῳ, (καὶ ἐκεῖ ἡ κιβωτὸς διαθήκης Κυρίου ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις
28 ἐκείναις, καὶ Φινεὲς υἱὸς Ἐλεάζαρ υἱοῦ Ἀαρὼν παρεστηκὼς ἐνώ-
πιον αὐτῆς ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις) λέγων· εἰ προσθῶ ἔτι ἐξελθεῖν
εἰς πόλεμον μετὰ υἱῶν Βενιαμεὶν τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ μου, ἢ κοπάσω;
Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος· ἀνάβητε, ὅτι αὔριον παραδώσω αὐτὸν ἐν χειρί
29 σου. Καὶ ἔθηκαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἔνεδρα ἐν τῇ Γαβαᾷ κύκλῳ.

### Judges Chapter 20

**15.** ...twenty and five thousand men that drew sword, besides those dwelling in Gibeah; these were mustered, seven hundred men,
**16.** chosen young men, out of all this people, seven hundred chosen men [who were] ambidextrous; all these were slingers, throwing stones at a hair's breadth, and missing not [their mark].
**17.** And all the men of Israel were mustered, save the children of Benjamin, four hundred thousand men that drew sword; all these were mighty men of war.

**18.** And they arose and went up to Bethel, and enquired of God, saying, "Who among us shall go up first to battle against the children of Benjamin?" And the Lord said, "Judah shall go up first, leading [the way]."
**19.** And the children of Israel rose up early in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah.
**20.** And there went forth (Israel, and) all the men of Israel to battle with Benjamin, and arrayed themselves against them in battle, [even] the men of Israel, at Gibeah.
**21.** And the children of Benjamin came forth out of the city, and on that day slew of Israel two and twenty thousand men [who fell] to the ground.
**22.** And the people, [even] the men of Israel, took courage, and again set themselves in array for battle in the place where they had arrayed themselves on the first day.
**23.** And the children of Israel went up and wept before the Lord until the evening; and enquired of the Lord, saying, "Shall I yet again draw nigh to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother?" And the Lord said, "Go up against him."
**24.** And the children of Israel approached the children of Benjamin on the second day.
**25.** And Benjamin came forth to meet them out of Gibeah on the second day, and again slew of the people eighteen thousand men [who fell] to the ground; all these were drawing sword.

**26.** And all the children of Israel, even all the people, went up and came to Bethel, and wept, and sat there before the Lord, and fasted that day until the evening, and offered burnt offerings and sacrifices of deliverance before the Lord;
**27.** And the children of Israel enquired of the Lord, (for the ark of the covenant of the Lord was there in those days,
**28.** and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, "Shall I yet again go forth to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease?" And the Lord said, "Go up; for tomorrow I will deliver him into thy hand."
**29.** And the children of Israel set ambushes against Gibeah round about.
