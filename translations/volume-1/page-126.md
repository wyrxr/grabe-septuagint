ριος τὴν καρδίαν Φαραὼ, καὶ οὐκ εἰσήκουσεν αὐτῶν, καθὰ συνέτα-
ξε Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ. Εἶπε δὲ Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν· ὄρθρισον 13
τὸ πρωΐ, καὶ στῆθι ἐναντίον Φαραὼ, καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτόν· τάδε
λέγει Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τῶν Ἑβραίων· ἐξαπόστειλον τὸν λαόν μου,
ἵνα λατρεύσωσί μοι. Ἐν τῷ γὰρ νῦν καιρῷ ἐγὼ ἐξαποστέλλω πάν- 14
τα τὰ συναντήματά μου εἰς τὴν καρδίαν σου, καὶ τῶν θεραπόν-
των σου, καὶ τοῦ λαοῦ σου· ἵνα εἰδῇς, ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν , ὡς ἐγώ,
ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ. Νῦν γὰρ ἀποστείλας τὴν χεῖρά μου, πατάξω σε 15
καὶ τὸν λαόν σου θανάτῳ, καὶ ἐκτριβήσῃ ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς. Καὶ ἕνε- 16
κεν τούτου διετετρήθης, ἵνα ἐνδείξωμαι ἐν σοὶ τὴν δύναμίν μου, καὶ
ὅπως διαγγελῇ τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ. Ἔτι οὖν σὺ ἐμ- 17
ποιῇ τοῦ λαοῦ μου, τοῦ μὴ ἐξαποστεῖλαι αὐτούς ; Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ὕω
ταύτην τὴν ὥραν αὔριον χάλαζαν πολλὴν σφόδρα, ἥτις τοιαύτη οὐ 18
γέγονεν ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ, ἀφ᾿ ἧς ἡμέρας ἔκτισται, καὶ ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας
ταύτης. Νῦν οὖν κατάσπευσον συναγαγεῖν τὰ κτήνη σου, καὶ ὅσα 19
σοι εἰσὶν ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ· πάντες γὰρ οἱ ἄνθρωποι καὶ τὰ κτήνη ὅσα
ἂν εὑρεθῇ ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ, καὶ μὴ εἰσέλθῃ εἰς οἰκίαν, πέσῃ δὲ ἡ χά-
λαζα ἐπ᾿ αὐτὰ, τελευτήσει. Ὁ φοβούμενος τὸ ῥῆμα Κυρίου τῶν 20
θεραπόντων Φαραὼ, συνήγαγε τοὺς παῖδας αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰ κτήνη αὐ-
τοῦ εἰς τοὺς οἴκους· ὃς δὲ μὴ προσέσχε τῇ διανοίᾳ εἰς τὸ ῥῆ- 21
μα Κυρίου, ἀφῆκε τὰ κτήνη ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ. Εἶπε δὲ Κύριος πρὸς 22
Μωυσῆν· ἔκτεινον τὴν χεῖρά σου εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν, καὶ ἔσται χά-
λαζα ἐπὶ πᾶσαν γῆν Αἰγύπτου, ἐπί τε τοὺς ἀνθρώπους καὶ ἐπὶ
τὰ κτήνη, καὶ ἐπὶ πᾶσαν βοτάνην τὴν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς. Ἐξέτεινε δὲ 23
Μωυσῆς τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν, καὶ Κύριος ἔδωκε φω-
νὰς καὶ χάλαζαν, καὶ διέτρεχε τὸ πῦρ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς· καὶ ἔβρεξε
Κύριος χάλαζαν ἐπὶ πᾶσαν γῆν Αἰγύπτου. Ἦν δὲ ἡ χάλαζα καὶ 24
τὸ πῦρ φλογίζον ἐν τῇ χαλάζῃ· ἡ δὲ χάλαζα πολλὴ σφόδρα σφόδρα,
ἥτις οὐ γέγονε τοιαύτη ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ, ἀφ᾿ οὗ γεγένηται ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς
ἔθνος. Ἐπάταξε δὲ ἡ χάλαζα ἐν πάσῃ γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ πάντα ὅσα ἦν 25
ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ ἀπὸ ἀνθρώπου ἕως κτήνους· καὶ πᾶσαν βοτάνην τὴν
ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ ἐπάταξεν ἡ χάλαζα, καὶ πάντα τὰ ξύλα τὰ ἐν τοῖς
πεδίοις συνέτριψεν (ἡ χάλαζα). Πλὴν ἐν τῇ Γεσὲν, οὐ ἦσαν οἱ 26
υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ, οὐκ ἐγένετο ἡ χάλαζα. Ἀποστείλας δὲ Φαραὼ ἐκά- 27
λεσε Μωυσῆν καὶ Ἀαρὼν, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· ἡμάρτηκα τὸ νῦν· ὁ
Κύριος δίκαιος, ἐγὼ δὲ καὶ ὁ λαός μου ἀσεβεῖς. Εὔξασθε οὖν 28

**EXODUS. CHAPTER IX.**

...the Lord had hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he hearkened not unto them, as the Lord commanded Moses.

13 Then the Lord said unto Moses, “Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, ‘Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews: Send forth My people, that they may serve Me.
14 For at this very hour I shall send forth all My visitations into thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, that thou mayest know that there is none like Me in all the earth.
15 For now, having stretched forth My hand, I will smite thee and thy people with death, and thou shalt be utterly destroyed from the earth.
16 And for this very cause wert thou made to endure, that I might display My power in thee, and that My Name might be proclaimed in all the earth.
17 Wilt thou yet hold back My people, refusing to let them go? Behold, tomorrow at this hour, I shall cause to rain a very great and mighty hail,
18 such as hath not been in Egypt since the day it was founded, even until this present day.
19 Now therefore, make haste to gather thy cattle, and whatsoever thou hast in the field; for every man and all the cattle that shall be found in the field, and not be brought home into the house, when the hail shall fall upon them, they shall die.’”
20 He among the servants of Pharaoh who feared the word of the Lord, gathered his male servants and his cattle into the houses;
21 but he that heeded not the word of the Lord left his cattle in the field.
22 Then the Lord said unto Moses, “Stretch forth thy hand toward heaven, that there may be hail upon all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field that is upon the earth.”
23 And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven, and the Lord sent forth thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the earth; and the Lord rained hail upon all the land of Egypt.
24 And there was hail, and fire flaming within the hail; and the hail was exceedingly, exceedingly great, such as had not been in all Egypt since it became a nation.
25 And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and every herb of the field did the hail smite, and every tree in the fields did it shatter (the hail).
26 Save only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, there was no hail.
27 And Pharaoh sent and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, “I have sinned this time: the Lord is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.
28 Now therefore, pray ye
