34 δὲ παιδίον ἀναβήτω μετὰ τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτοῦ. Πῶς γὰρ ἀναβήσομαι πρὸς τὸν πατέρα, τοῦ παιδίου μὴ ὄντος μεθ᾿ ἡμῶν ; ἵνα μὴ ἴδω τὰ κακά, ἃ εὑρήσει τὸν πατέρα μου.

ΚΕΦ. ΜΕ´. XLV.

1 ΚΑΙ οὐκ ἠδύνατο Ἰωσὴφ ἀνέχεσθαι πάντων τῶν παρεστηκότων αὐτῷ, ἀλλ᾽ εἶπεν· ἐξαποστείλατε πάντας ἀπ᾽ ἐμοῦ. Καὶ οὐ παρειστήκει οὐδεὶς ἔτι τῷ Ἰωσήφ, ἡνίκα ἀνεγνωρίζετο Ἰωσὴφ τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς αὐτοῦ.
2 Καὶ ἀφῆκε φωνὴν μετὰ κλαυθμοῦ· ἤκουσαν δὲ πάντες οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι, καὶ ἀκουστὸν ἐγένετο εἰς τὸν οἶκον Φαραώ.
3 Εἶπε δὲ Ἰωσὴφ πρὸς τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ· ἐγώ εἰμι Ἰωσὴφ (ὁ ἀδελφὸς ὑμῶν, ὃν ἀπέδοσθε εἰς Αἴγυπτον), ἔτι δ᾽ ὁ πατήρ μου ζῇ; Καὶ οὐκ ἠδύναντο οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ ἀποκριθῆναι αὐτῷ· ἐταράχθησαν γάρ.
4 Εἶπε δὲ Ἰωσὴφ πρὸς τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ· ἐγγίσατε πρός με καὶ ἤγγισαν. Καὶ εἶπεν· ἐγώ εἰμι Ἰωσὴφ ὁ ἀδελφὸς ὑμῶν, ὃν ἀπέδοσθε εἰς Αἴγυπτον.
5 Νῦν οὖν μὴ λυπεῖσθε, μηδὲ σκληρὸν ὑμῖν φανήτω, ὅτι ἀπέδοσθέ με ὧδε· εἰς γὰρ ζωὴν ἀπέστειλέ με ὁ Θεὸς ἔμπροσθεν ὑμῶν.
6 Τοῦτο γὰρ δεύτερον ἔτος λιμοῦ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἔτι λοιπὰ πέντε ἔτη, ἐν οἷς οὐκ ἔσται ἀροτρίας, οὐδὲ ἀμητός.
7 Ἀπέστειλε γάρ με ὁ Θεὸς ἔμπροσθεν ὑμῶν, ὑπολείπεσθαι ὑμῶν κατάλειμμα ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἐκθρέψαι ὑμῶν κατάλειψιν μεγάλην.
8 Νῦν οὖν οὐχ ὑμεῖς με ἀπεστάλκατε ὧδε, ἀλλ᾽ ὁ Θεός· καὶ ἐποίησέ με ὡς πατέρα Φαραώ, καὶ κύριον παντὸς τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἄρχοντα πάσης τῆς Αἰγύπτου.
9 Σπεύσαντες οὖν, ἀνάβητε πρὸς τὸν πατέρα μου, καὶ εἴπατε αὐτῷ· τάδε λέγει ὁ υἱός σου Ἰωσήφ· ἐποίησέ με ὁ Θεὸς κύριον πάσης τῆς Αἰγύπτου· κατάβηθι οὖν πρός με, καὶ μὴ μείνῃς·
10 καὶ κατοικήσεις ἐν γῇ Γεσὲν Ἀραβίας, καὶ ἔσῃ ἐγγύς μου σύ, καὶ οἱ υἱοί σου, καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ τῶν υἱῶν σου, καὶ τὰ πρόβατά σου, καὶ οἱ βόες σου, καὶ ὅσα σοι (ἔχει)·
11 καὶ ἐκθρέψω σε ἐκεῖ, (ἔτι γὰρ πέντε ἔτη λιμός), ἵνα μὴ ἐκτριβῇς σύ, καὶ οἱ υἱοί σου, καὶ πάντα τὰ ὑπάρχοντά σου.
12 Ἰδοὺ οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ ὑμῶν βλέπουσι, καὶ οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ Βενιαμὶν τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ μου, ὅτι τὸ στόμα μου τὸ λαλοῦν πρὸς ὑμᾶς.
13 Ἀπαγγείλατε οὖν τῷ πατρί μου πᾶσαν τὴν δόξαν μου τὴν ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ, καὶ ὅσα ἴδετε· καὶ ταχύναντες, καταγάγετε τὸν πατέρα μου

### Genesis Chapter 45

34 but let the child go up with his brethren. For how shall I go up unto my father, the child not being with us? Lest I behold the evils which shall come upon my father.

#### Chapter XLV

1 Now Joseph could not restrain himself before all them that stood by him; but he cried, "Send forth all men from me." And no man stood with Joseph while he made himself known unto his brethren.
2 And he uttered his voice with weeping; and all the Egyptians heard, and it was heard in the house of Pharaoh.
3 Then Joseph said unto his brethren, "I am Joseph (your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt); doth my father yet live?" But his brethren could not answer him, for they were troubled.
4 And Joseph said unto his brethren, "Come near to me." And they came near. Then he said, "I am Joseph, your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.
5 Now therefore be not grieved, nor let it seem grievous unto you, that ye sold me hither; for God did send me before you for the preservation of life.
6 For these two years hath the famine been upon the earth, and there are yet five years remaining, in which there shall be neither plowing nor harvest.
7 And God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant upon the earth, and to nourish for you a great lineage [of survivors].
8 So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God; and He hath made me as a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.
9 Hasten ye therefore, and go up to my father, and say unto him, 'Thus saith thy son Joseph: God hath made me lord of all Egypt; come down unto me, and tarry not;
10 and thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen of Arabia, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy sons, and thy sons' sons, and thy sheep, and thine oxen, and all that thou hast [of possessions];
11 and I will nourish thee there (for yet there are five years of famine), lest thou be utterly destroyed, thou, and thy sons, and all that thou possessest.'
12 Behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.
13 Ye shall therefore tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and all that ye have seen; and hasten ye, and bring down my father"
