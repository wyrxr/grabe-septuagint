τῷ σπέρματι αὐτοῦ μετ’ αὐτὸν διαθήκη ἱερατείας αἰωνίας, ἀνθ’ ὧν
ἐζήλωσε τῷ Θεῷ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐξιλάσατο περὶ τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ.
Τὸ δὲ ὄνομα τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τοῦ Ἰσραηλίτου τοῦ πεπληγότος, ὃς 14
ἐκλήθη μετὰ τῆς Μαδιανίτιδος, Σαμβρί, υἱὸς Σαλῶ, ἄρχων οἴκου
πατριᾶς Συμεῶν· καὶ ὄνομα τῇ γυναικὶ τῇ Μαδιανίτιδι τῇ πεπληγίᾳ, 15
Χασβί, θυγάτηρ Σὺρ, ἄρχοντος ἔθνους Ὀμμὼθ, οἴκου
πατριᾶς ἐστι τῶν Μαδιάμ. Καὶ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, 16
λέγων· λάλησον τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ, λέγων· ἐχθραίνετε τοῖς Μαδιηναίοις, 17
καὶ πατάξατε αὐτοὺς, ὅτι ἐχθραίνουσιν αὐτοὶ ὑμῖν ἐν δολιότητι 18
αὐτῶν, ὅσα δολιοῦσιν ὑμᾶς διὰ Φογὼρ καὶ διὰ Χασβί· θυγατέρα
ἄρχοντος Μαδιὰμ τὴν ἀδελφὴν αὐτῶν, τὴν πεπληγίαν ἐν
τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῆς πληγῆς διὰ Φογώρ.

ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο μετὰ τὴν πληγὴν, καὶ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν 1
(λέγων) καὶ πρὸς Ἐλεάζαρ υἱὸν Ἀαρὼν τὸν ἱερέα, λέγων·
λάβε τὴν ἀρχὴν πάσης τῆς συναγωγῆς υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ ἀπὸ εἰκοσαετοῦς 2
καὶ ἐπάνω κατ’ οἴκους πατριῶν αὐτῶν, πᾶς ὁ ἐκπορευόμενος
παρατάξασθαι ἐν Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἐλάλησε Μωυσῆς καὶ Ἐλεάζαρ 3
ὁ ἱερεὺς μετ’ αὐτῶν ἐν Ἀραβὼθ Μωὰβ ἐπὶ τοῦ Ἰορδάνου κατὰ
Ἱεριχὼ, λέγων· ἀπὸ εἰκοσαετοῦς καὶ ἐπάνω, ὃν τρόπον συνέταξε 4
Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ. Καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ οἱ ἐξελθόντες ἐξ Αἰγύπτου·
Ῥουβὴν πρωτότοκος Ἰσραήλ· υἱοὶ δὲ Ῥουβὴν· Ἑνώχ, καὶ 5
δῆμος τοῦ Ἑνώχ· τῷ Φαλλοῦ, δῆμος τοῦ Φαλλοῦ· τῷ Ἀσρών, 6
δῆμος τοῦ Ἀσρωνί· τῷ Χαρμεῖ, δῆμος τοῦ Χαρμεῖ. Οὗτοι δῆμοι 7
Ῥουβήν· καὶ ἐγένετο ἡ ἐπίσκεψις αὐτῶν, τρεῖς καὶ τεσσαράκοντα
χιλιάδες καὶ ἑπτακόσιοι καὶ τριάκοντα. Καὶ υἱοὶ Φαλλοῦ, Ἑλιάβ 8
καὶ υἱοὶ Ἑλιάβ, Ναμουὴλ, καὶ Δαθὰν, καὶ Ἀβειρών. Καὶ Δαθὰν 9
καὶ Ἀβειρὼν οὗτοι ἐπίκλητοι τῆς συναγωγῆς, οὗτοι εἰσιν οἱ ἐπι-
στάντες ἐπὶ Μωυσῆν καὶ Ἀαρὼν ἐν τῇ συναγωγῇ Κορὲ, ἐν τῇ
ἐπισυστάσει Κυρίου· καὶ ἀνοίξασα ἡ γῆ τὸ στόμα αὐτῆς, κατέπιεν 10
αὐτοὺς καὶ Κορὲ ἐν τῷ θανάτῳ τῆς συναγωγῆς αὐτοῦ, ὅτε κατέφαγε
τὸ πῦρ τοὺς πεντήκοντα καὶ διακοσίους, καὶ ἐγενήθησαν ἐν
σημείῳ· οἱ δὲ υἱοὶ Κορὲ οὐκ ἀπέθανον. 11
Καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Συμεὼν, δῆμος τῶν υἱῶν Συμεὼν· τῷ Ναμουὴλ, δῆμος ὁ Ναμουηλεί· 12

**Chapter 25**

13 ...unto his seed after him, a covenant of an everlasting priesthood, because he was jealous for his God, and made atonement for the children of Israel.

14 Now the name of the man of Israel who was slain, even he who was called with the Midianitess, was Zambri, the son of Salo, a ruler of a house of the tribe of Symeon;
15 and the name of the woman, the Midianitess who was slain, was Chazbi, daughter of Sur, a ruler of the nation of Ommoth, [who was] of a house of the tribe of the Midianites.

16 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying:
17 "Speak unto the children of Israel, saying: 'Be hostile to the Midianites, and smite them,
18 for they are hostile to you in their treachery, in all wherein they deal treacherously with you through Phogor and through Chazbi, the daughter of a ruler of Midian, their sister, who was slain in the day of the plague through Phogor.'"

**Chapter 26**

1 And it came to pass after the plague, that the Lord spake unto Moses (saying), and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying:
2 "Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, by houses of their tribes, every one who goeth forth to array [himself] in Israel."
3 And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in Arboth Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying:
4 "From twenty years old and upward, in the manner that the Lord commanded Moses." And the children of Israel who went forth out of Egypt:

5 Reuben, the firstborn of Israel. Now the sons of Reuben: Enoch, and the clan of Enoch;
6 to Phallou, the clan of Phallou; to Asron, the clan of the Asronites;
7 to Charmei, the clan of Charmei. These are the clans of Reuben; and their muster was forty-three thousand seven hundred and thirty.
8 And the sons of Phallou: Eliab. And the sons of Eliab: Namouel, and Dathan, and Abeiron.
9 Now Dathan and Abeiron, these were called [from] the congregation, these were they who rose up against Moses and Aaron in the congregation of Kore, in their conspiracy against the Lord;
10 and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up and Kore, at the death of his congregation, when the fire devoured the two hundred and fifty, and they became a sign.
11 But the sons of Kore died not.

12 And the sons of Symeon: the clan of the sons of Symeon. To Namouel, the clan of the Namouelites;
