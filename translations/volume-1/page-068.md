### Genesis Chapter 30

**Original Text:**

ΚΕΦ. Λ´.                       ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ               53
ἔάν τί σοι δώσω; Εἶπε δὲ αὐτῷ Ἰακώβ· οὐ δώσεις μοι οὐθέν.
Ἐὰν ποιήσῃς μοι τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο, πάλιν ποιμανῶ τὰ πρόβατά
σου, καὶ φυλάξω· παρελθάτω πάντα τὰ πρόβατά σου σήμερον, 32
καὶ διαχώρισον ἐκεῖθεν πᾶν πρόβατον ποικίλον καὶ περκνόν, καὶ
πᾶν βόσκημα φαιὸν ἐν τοῖς ἄρνασι, καὶ πᾶν ῥαντὸν καὶ διάλευ-
κον ἐν ταῖς αἰξὶ, καὶ ἔσται μοι μισθός. Καὶ ἐπακούσεταί μοι ἡ 33
δικαιοσύνη μου ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ αὔριον, ὅτι ἐστὶν ὁ μισθός μου
ἐνώπιόν σου· πᾶν ὃ ἐὰν μὴ ᾖ ῥαντὸν καὶ διάλευκον ἐν ταῖς αἰξὶ,
καὶ φαιὸν ἐν τοῖς ἄρνασι, κεκλεμμένον ἔσται παρ᾽ ἐμοί. Εἶπε δὲ 34
αὐτῷ Λάβαν· ἔστω κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμά σου. Καὶ διέστειλεν ἐν τῇ ἡ- 35
μέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ τοὺς τράγους τοὺς ῥαντοὺς καὶ τοὺς διαλεύκους, καὶ
πάσας τὰς αἶγας τὰς ῥαντὰς καὶ τὰς διαλεύκους, καὶ πᾶν ὃ ἦν
λευκὸν ἐν αὐτοῖς, καὶ πᾶν ὃ ἦν φαιὸν ἐν τοῖς ἄρνασι· καὶ ἔδωκε
διὰ χειρὸς τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἀπέστησεν ὁδὸν τριῶν ἡμερῶν 36
ἀνὰ μέσον αὐτῶν καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον Ἰακώβ· Ἰακὼβ δὲ ἐποίμαινε τὰ
πρόβατα Λάβαν τὰ ὑπολειφθέντα. Ἔλαβε δὲ αὐτῷ Ἰακὼβ ῥάβδον 37
στυρακίνην χλωρὰν καὶ καρυΐνην καὶ πλατάνου, καὶ ἐλέπισεν αὐ-
τὰς Ἰακὼβ λεπίσματα λευκὰ, περισύρων τὸ χλωρόν· ἐφαίνετο δὲ
ἐπὶ ταῖς ῥάβδοις τὸ λευκὸν, ὃ ἐλέπισε, ποικίλον. Καὶ παρέθηκε τὰς 38
ῥάβδους ἃς ἐλέπισεν, ἐν τοῖς ληνοῖς τῶν ποτιστηρίων τοῦ ὕδατος·
ἵνα, ὡς ἂν ἔλθωσι τὰ πρόβατα πιεῖν ἐνώπιον τῶν ῥάβδων, (καὶ)
ἐλθόντων αὐτῶν εἰς τὸ πιεῖν, ἐγκισσήσωσι τὰ πρόβατα εἰς τὰς
ῥάβδους. Καὶ ἐνεκίσσων τὰ πρόβατα εἰς τὰς ῥάβδους, καὶ ἔτικτον 39
τὰ πρόβατα διάλευκα καὶ ποικίλα καὶ σποδοειδῆ ῥαντά. Τοὺς δὲ 40
ἀμνοὺς διέστειλεν Ἰακὼβ, καὶ ἔστησεν ἐναντίον τῶν προβάτων κρι-
ῶν διαλεύκων, καὶ πᾶν ποικίλον ἐν τοῖς ἀμνοῖς· καὶ διεχώρισεν
ἑαυτῷ ποίμνια καθ᾽ ἑαυτὸν, καὶ οὐκ ἔμιξεν αὐτὰ εἰς τὰ πρόβατα
Λάβαν. Ἐγένετο δὲ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ᾧ ἐνεκίσσων τὰ πρόβατα ἐν 41
γαστρὶ λαμβάνοντα, ἔθηκεν Ἰακὼβ τὰς ῥάβδους ἐναντίον τῶν προ-
βάτων ἐν τοῖς ληνοῖς, τοῦ ἐγκισσῆσαι αὐτὰ κατὰ τὰς ῥάβδους·
ἡνίκα γὰρ ἔτεκον τὰ πρόβατα οὐκ ἐτίθει. Ἐγένετο δὲ τὰ ἄσημα 42
τοῦ Λάβαν, τὰ δὲ ἐπίσημα τοῦ Ἰακώβ. Καὶ ἐπλούτησεν ὁ ἄνθρω- 43
πος σφόδρα σφόδρα· καὶ ἐγένετο αὐτῷ κτήνη πολλὰ, καὶ βόες,
καὶ παῖδες, καὶ παιδίσκαι, καὶ κάμηλοι, καὶ ὄνοι.

**English Translation:**

### GENESIS CHAPTER 30

**31** What shall I give thee? And Jacob said unto him, Thou shalt give me nothing. If thou wilt do this thing for me, I shall again tend thy flock and keep it.
**32** Let all thy flock pass by this day, and do thou separate therefrom every speckled and mottled sheep, and every grey animal amongst the lambs, and every spotted and parti-colored [one] amongst the goats; and of these shall be my hire.
**33** And my righteousness shall answer for me on the morrow, when my hire shall be before thee: every [beast] that is not spotted and parti-colored amongst the goats, and grey amongst the lambs, that shall be counted stolen with me.
**34** And Laban said unto him, Be it according to thy word.
**35** And Laban separated that same day the he-goats that were spotted and parti-colored, and all the she-goats that were spotted and parti-colored, and all that was white among them, and all that was grey amongst the lambs; and he gave them into the hands of his sons.
**36** And he set a journey of three days' distance betwixt them and betwixt Jacob; and Jacob tended the sheep of Laban that were left.
**37** Then Jacob took for himself rods of fresh storax-tree, and of walnut, and of plane-tree; and Jacob peeled white strips on them, exposing the fresh [wood]. And the white, which he had peeled, did appear mottled upon the rods.
**38** And he set the rods, which he had peeled, in the troughs of the watering-places of the water; that when the sheep should come to drink before the rods, [yea], when they had come unto the drinking, the sheep might conceive by the rods.
**39** And the sheep did conceive by the rods, and brought forth sheep that were parti-colored and speckled and ash-colored, spotted.
**40** And Jacob separated the lambs, and he set before the [rest of the] sheep white-speckled rams, and every speckled [one] amongst the lambs. And he put his own flocks apart by themselves, and did not mingle them with Laban's sheep.
**41** And it came to pass that at the season when the sheep were conceiving in their womb, Jacob placed the rods before the sheep in the troughs, to cause them to conceive according to the rods; for when the sheep did bring forth, he did not place [them].
**42** And thus, the unmarked ones became Laban's, but the marked ones were Jacob's.
**43** And the man waxed exceeding rich; and he had many cattle, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.
