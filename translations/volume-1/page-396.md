Διέβησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ῥουβὴν, καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ Γὰδ, καὶ οἱ ἡμίσεις φυλῆς Μανασσῆ διεσκευασμένοι ἔμπροσθεν τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ, καθάπερ ἐνετείλατο αὐτοῖς Μωυσῆς· τετραχισμύριοι εὔζωνοι εἰς μάχην διέβησαν 13 ἐναντίον Κυρίου εἰς πόλεμον πρὸς τὴν Ἱεριχὼ πόλιν. Ἐν ἐκείνῃ 14 τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ηὔξησε Κύριος τὸν Ἰησοῦν ἐναντίον παντὸς τοῦ γένους Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ ἐφοβοῦντο αὐτὸν, ὥσπερ ἐφοβοῦντο Μωυσῆν, ὅσον χρόνον ἔζη. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος τῷ Ἰησοῦ, λέγων· ἔντειλαι 15 τοῖς ἱερεῦσι 16 τοῖς αἴρουσι τὴν κιβωτὸν τῆς διαθήκης τοῦ μαρτυρίου (Κυρίου), ἐκβῆναι ἐκ τοῦ Ἰορδάνου. Καὶ ἐνετείλατο Ἰησοῦς 17 τοῖς ἱερεῦσι, λέγων· ἔκβητε ἐκ τοῦ Ἰορδάνου. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὡς ἐξέβησαν 18 οἱ ἱερεῖς οἱ αἴροντες τὴν κιβωτὸν τῆς διαθήκης Κυρίου ἐκ μέσου τοῦ Ἰορδάνου, καὶ ἔθηκαν τοὺς πόδας αὐτῶν οἱ ἱερεῖς ἐπὶ τῆς ξηρᾶς, καὶ ὥρμησε τὸ ὕδωρ τοῦ Ἰορδάνου κατὰ χώραν, καὶ ἐπορεύετο καθὰ ἐχθὲς καὶ τρίτην ἡμέραν δι᾿ ὅλης τῆς κρηπῖδος αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ὁ λαὸς ἀνέβη ἐκ τοῦ Ἰορδάνου δεκάτῃ τοῦ μηνὸς τοῦ 19 πρώτου· καὶ κατεστρατοπέδευσαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ ἐν Γαλγάλοις κατὰ μέρος τὸ πρὸς ἡλίου ἀνατολὰς ἀπὸ τῆς Ἱεριχώ. Καὶ τοὺς 20 δώδεκα λίθους τούτους, οὓς ἔλαβεν ἐκ τοῦ Ἰορδάνου, ἔστησεν Ἰησοῦς ἐν Γαλγάλοις, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ, λέγων· ὅταν 21 ἐρωτῶσιν οἱ υἱοὶ ὑμῶν αὔριον ὑμᾶς, λέγοντες· τί εἰσιν οἱ λίθοι οὗτοι; ἀναγγεῖλατε τοῖς υἱοῖς ὑμῶν, ὅτι ἐπὶ ξηρᾶς διέβη Ἰσραὴλ 22 τὸν Ἰορδάνην τοῦτον, ἀποξηράναντος Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ὑμῶν τὸ 23 ὕδωρ τοῦ Ἰορδάνου ἐκ τοῦ ἔμπροσθεν αὐτῶν, μέχρις οὗ διέβησαν, καθάπερ ἐποίησε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν τὴν ἐρυθρὰν θάλασσαν, ἣν ἀπεξήρανε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν ἔμπροσθεν ἡμῶν, ἕως παρήλθομεν· ὅπως γνῶσι πάντα τὰ ἔθνη τῆς γῆς, ὅτι ἡ δύναμις 24 τοῦ Κυρίου ἰσχυρά ἐστι, καὶ ἵνα ὑμεῖς σέβησθε τὸν Κύριον Θεὸν ὑμῶν ἐν παντὶ χρόνῳ.

ΚΕΦ. Ε΄. V.

ΚΑΙ ἐγένετο ὡς ἤκουσαν πάντες οἱ βασιλεῖς τῶν Ἀμορραίων 1
οἳ ἦσαν πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου παρὰ τὴν θάλασσαν, καὶ πάντες οἱ βασιλεῖς τῆς Φοινίκης οἳ παρὰ τὴν θάλασσαν, ὅτι ἀπεξήρανε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τὸν Ἰορδάνην ποταμὸν ἐκ τῶν ἔμπροσθεν τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τῷ διαβῆναι αὐτοὺς, καὶ κατετάκησαν αἱ διάνοιαι αὐτῶν καὶ κατεπλάγησαν, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ἐν αὐτοῖς φρόνησις οὐδεμία ἀπὸ προσώπου τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ.

**Joshua 4**

12 And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, passed over, arrayed for battle before the children of Israel, even as Moses had commanded them.
13 And some forty thousand, equipped for war, passed over before the Lord unto battle, toward the city Jericho.
14 On that day the Lord magnified Joshua in the sight of all the lineage of Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.
15 And the Lord spake unto Joshua, saying,
16 "Command thou the priests who bear the ark of the covenant of the testimony (of the Lord) to come up out of Jordan."
17 And Joshua commanded the priests, saying, "Come ye up out of Jordan."
18 And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord were come up out of the midst of Jordan, and the priests had set their feet upon the dry ground, that the waters of Jordan turned back to their place, and flowed as before, even as yesterday and the third day, along all its banks.
19 And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month; and the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, in the portion eastward from Jericho.
20 And these twelve stones, which Joshua took out of Jordan, he set up in Gilgal.
21 And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, "When your children shall ask you tomorrow, saying, 'What mean these stones?'
22 Then ye shall declare unto your children, [that] on dry ground Israel passed over this Jordan;
23 for the Lord your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before them, until they were passed over, even as the Lord your God did to the Red Sea, which the Lord our God dried up before us, until we were passed over:
24 that all the peoples of the earth may know that the power of the Lord is mighty; and that ye may revere the Lord your God forevermore."

**Joshua 5**

1 And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which were beyond Jordan toward the sea, and all the kings of Phoenicia, which were by the sea, heard that the Lord God had dried up the river Jordan from before the children of Israel, when they passed over, that their hearts melted, and they were utterly dismayed, and there was no spirit in them anymore, because of the children of Israel.
