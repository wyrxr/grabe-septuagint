ΚΕΦ. ΙΘ΄. ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ 29
σαν ζητοῦντες τὴν θύραν. Εἶπαν δὲ οἱ ἄνδρες πρὸς Λώτ· ἔστι 12
τίς σοι ὧδε, γαμβροὶ ἢ υἱοὶ ἢ θυγατέρες; ἢ εἴτις σοι ἄλλος ἐστὶν
ἐν τῇ πόλει, ἐξάγαγε ἐκ τοῦ τόπου τούτου. Ὅτι ἀπόλλυμεν ἡ 13
μεῖς τὸν τόπον τοῦτον, ὅτι ὑψώθη ἡ κραυγὴ αὐτῶν ἐναντίον Κυ-
ρίου· καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ἡμᾶς Κύριος, ἐκτρῖψαι αὐτήν. Ἐξῆλθε δὲ 14
Λώτ, καὶ ἐλάλησε πρὸς τοὺς γαμβροὺς αὐτοῦ τοὺς εἰληφότας τὰς
θυγατέρας αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπεν· ἀνάστητε, καὶ ἐξέλθετε ἐκ τοῦ τό-
που τούτου, ὅτι ἐκτρίβει Κύριος τὴν πόλιν. Ἔδοξε δὲ γελοιά-
ζειν ἐναντίον τῶν γαμβρῶν αὐτοῦ. Ἡνίκα δὲ ὄρθρος ἐγένετο, ἐσ- 15
σπούδαζον οἱ ἄγγελοι τὸν Λώτ, λέγοντες· ἀναστὰς λάβε τὴν γυ-
ναῖκά σου καὶ τὰς δύο θυγατέρας σου, ἃς ἔχεις, καὶ ἔξελθε, ἵνα
μὴ συναπόλῃ ταῖς ἀνομίαις τῆς πόλεως. Καὶ ἐταράχθησαν, καὶ 16
ἐκράτησαν οἱ ἄγγελοι τῆς χειρὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ τῆς χειρὸς τῆς γυ-
ναικὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ τῶν χειρῶν τῶν δύο θυγατέρων αὐτοῦ, ἐν τῷ
φείσασθαι Κύριον αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐγένετο ἡνίκα ἐξήγαγον αὐτοὺς ἔξω, 17
καὶ εἶπαν· σώζων σῶζε τὴν σεαυτοῦ ψυχήν· μὴ περιβλέψῃς εἰς
τὰ ὀπίσω, μηδὲ στῇς ἐν πάσῃ τῇ περιχώρῳ· εἰς τὸ ὄρος σώ-
ζου, μήποτε συμπαραληφθῇς. Εἶπε δὲ Λὼτ πρὸς αὐτούς· δέομαι 18
Κύριε, ἐπειδὴ εὗρεν ὁ παῖς σου ἔλεος ἐναντίον σου, καὶ ἐμε- 19
γάλυνας τὴν δικαιοσύνην σου, ὃ ποιεῖς ἐπ’ ἐμέ, τοῦ ζῆν τὴν ψυχήν
μου, ἐγὼ δὲ οὐ δυνήσομαι διασωθῆναι εἰς τὸ ὄρος, μὴ καταλάβῃ
με τὰ κακά, καὶ ἀποθάνω· ἰδοὺ ἡ πόλις αὕτη ἐγγὺς τοῦ κατα- 20
φυγεῖν με ἐκεῖ, ἢ ἔστι μικρά, ἐκεῖ σωθήσομαι· οὐ μικρά ἐστι· καὶ
ζήσεται ἡ ψυχή μου (ἕνεκέν σου). Καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· ἰδοὺ ἐθαύμα- 21
σά σου τὸ πρόσωπον καὶ ἐπὶ τῷ ῥήματι τούτῳ, τοῦ μὴ κατα-
στρέψαι τὴν πόλιν, περὶ ἧς ἐλάλησας. Σπεῦσον οὖν τοῦ σωθῆναι 22
ἐκεῖ· οὐ γὰρ δυνήσομαι ποιῆσαι πρᾶγμα, ἕως τοῦ σε ἐλθεῖν ἐκεῖ·
διὰ τοῦτο ἐπωνόμασε τὸ ὄνομα τῆς πόλεως (ἐκείνης), Σηγώρ.
Ὁ ἥλιος ἐξῆλθεν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, καὶ Λὼτ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς Σηγώρ. 23
Καὶ Κύριος ἔβρεξεν ἐπὶ Σόδομα καὶ Γόμορρα θεῖον καὶ πῦρ παρὰ 24
Κυρίου ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ· καὶ κατέστρεψε τὰς πόλεις ταύτας, (ἐν 25
αἷς κατῴκει ἐν αὐταῖς Λώτ,) καὶ πᾶσαν περίοικον, καὶ πάντας
τοὺς κατοικοῦντας ἐν ταῖς πόλεσι, καὶ πάντα τὰ ἀνατέλλοντα ἐκ
τῆς γῆς. Καὶ ἐπέβλεψεν ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω, καὶ ἐγένετο 26
στήλη ἁλός. Ὄρθρισε δὲ Ἀβραὰμ τὸ πρωὶ εἰς τὸν τόπον, οὗ εἱ- 27
στήκει ἐναντίον Κυρίου· καὶ ἐπέβλεψεν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον Σοδόμων 28

<sup>12</sup>...seeking the door. And the men said unto Lot, “Hast thou any here besides,
sons-in-law or sons or daughters? Or if thou hast any other in the city,
bring them forth from this place.
<sup>13</sup>For we do destroy this place; for the cry of them is grown great
before the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us forth, to destroy it.”
<sup>14</sup>And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons-in-law, who had taken his daughters,
and said, “Arise ye, and go forth from this place, for the Lord doth destroy the city.”
But he seemed to them as one that mocked before his sons-in-law.
<sup>15</sup>And when the morning was come, the angels did urge Lot, saying, “Arise,
take thy wife and thy two daughters, which thou hast, and depart,
lest thou be consumed in the iniquities of the city.”
<sup>16</sup>And they were troubled, and the angels laid hold upon his hand,
and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hands of his two daughters,
because the Lord had compassion on him.
<sup>17</sup>And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad,
that they said, “Save thy soul by saving thyself; look not behind thee,
neither stand thou in all the plain; save thyself unto the mountain,
lest thou be taken away [with them].”
<sup>18</sup>And Lot said unto them, “I pray [thee], Lord;
<sup>19</sup>Forasmuch as thy servant hath found mercy in thy sight,
and thou hast magnified thy righteousness, which thou showest upon me,
to save my life; but I shall not be able to escape to the mountain,
lest the evil overtake me, and I die;
<sup>20</sup>behold, this city is near for me to flee thither, and it is a small one;
there shall I be saved. Is it not a small one? And my soul shall live for thy sake.”
<sup>21</sup>And he said unto him, “Behold, I have regarded thy person even for this matter,
that I will not overthrow the city of which thou hast spoken.
<sup>22</sup>Haste thee then, to save thyself there; for I cannot do any thing,
until thou be come thither.” Therefore was the name of that city called Zoar.
<sup>23</sup>The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.
<sup>24</sup>And the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire
from the Lord out of heaven;
<sup>25</sup>and overthrew those cities, (in which Lot did dwell therein,) and all the plain,
and all that dwelt in the cities, and whatsoever grew upon the ground.
<sup>26</sup>But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
<sup>27</sup>And Abraham rose up early in the morning to the place where he stood
before the Lord;
<sup>28</sup>and he looked toward the face of Sodom
