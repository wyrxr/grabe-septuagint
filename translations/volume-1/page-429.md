8 ἀπὸ τῆς φυλῆς Ζαβουλὼν κληρωτὶ πόλεις δώδεκα. Καὶ ἔδωκαν οἱ
   υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ τοῖς Λευίταις τὰς πόλεις ταύτας καὶ τὰ περισπόρια
9 αὐτῶν ὃν τρόπον ἐνετείλατο Κύριος τῷ Μωσῇ, κληρωτί. Καὶ
   ἔδωκεν ἡ φυλὴ υἱῶν Ἰούδα καὶ ἡ φυλὴ υἱῶν Συμεὼν καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς
10 φυλῆς υἱῶν Βενιαμὶν τὰς πόλεις ταύτας· καὶ ἐπεκλήθησαν ἐν ὀνό-
11 ματι. Καὶ ἐγένοντο τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἀαρὼν ἀπὸ τοῦ δήμου τοῦ Καὰθ τῶν
   υἱῶν Λευί, (ὅτι τούτοις ἐγενήθη ὁ κλῆρος πρῶτος)· καὶ ἔδωκαν
   αὐτοῖς τὴν Καριαθαρβόχ, μητρόπολιν τῶν Ἐνάχ· (αὕτη ἐστὶ Χεβρὼν
   ἐν τῷ ὄρει (τῷ) Ἰούδα·) τὰ δὲ περισπόρια αὐτῆς τὰ κύκλῳ αὐτῆς,
12 καὶ τοὺς ἀγροὺς τῆς πόλεως, καὶ τὰς κώμας αὐτῆς ἔδωκεν Ἰησοῦς
13 τῷ Χαλέβ υἱῷ Ἰεφοννῆ ἐν κατασχέσει αὐτοῦ. Καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἀα-

   αὐτῇ, καὶ τὴν Ἰεττὰ, καὶ τὰ ἀφωρισμένα τὰ πρὸς αὐτῇ, καὶ Βεθ-
17 σαρές, καὶ τὰ ἀφωρισμένα τὰ πρὸς αὐτῇ· πόλεις ἐννέα παρὰ τῶν
   δύο φυλῶν τούτων. Καὶ παρὰ τῆς φυλῆς Βενιαμὶν, τὴν Γαβαὼν καὶ
18 τὰ ἀφωρισμένα τὰ πρὸς αὐτῇ, καὶ Γαβεὲ καὶ τὰ ἀφωρισμένα τὰ πρὸς
19 αὐτῇ, καὶ Ἀναθὼθ καὶ τὰ ἀφωρισμένα τὰ πρὸς αὐτῇ, καὶ τὴν Ἀλ-
