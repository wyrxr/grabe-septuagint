ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ
ΚΕΦ. ΜΔ΄. XLIV.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐνετείλατο Ἰωσὴφ τῷ ὄντι ἐπὶ τῆς οἰκίας αὐτοῦ, λέγων·
πλήσατε τοὺς μαρσίππους τῶν ἀνθρώπων βρωμάτων, ὅσα ἐὰν δύ-
νωνται ἆραι, καὶ ἐμβάλετε ἑκάστου τὸ ἀργύριον ἐπὶ τοῦ στόμα-
2 τος τοῦ μαρσίππου αὐτοῦ· καὶ τὸ κόνδυ μου τὸ ἀργυροῦν ἐμβά-
λετε εἰς τὸν μάρσιππον τοῦ νεωτέρου, καὶ τὴν τιμὴν τοῦ σίτου αὐτοῦ.
3 Ἐγενήθη δὲ κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα Ἰωσήφ, καθὼς εἶπε. Τὸ πρωΐ διέφαυ-
4 σε, καὶ οἱ ἄνθρωποι ἀπεστάλησαν, αὐτοὶ καὶ οἱ ὄνοι αὐτῶν. Ἐξ-
ελθόντων δὲ αὐτῶν τὴν πόλιν, οὐκ ἀπέσχον μακράν· καὶ Ἰωσὴφ εἶ-
πε τῷ ἐπὶ τῆς οἰκίας αὐτοῦ, λέγων· ἀναστὰς ἐπιδίωξον ὀπίσω
τῶν ἀνθρώπων, καὶ καταλήψῃ αὐτούς, καὶ ἐρεῖς αὐτοῖς· τί ὅτι ἀν-
5 ταπεδώκατέ (μοι) πονηρὰ ἀντὶ καλῶν; ἱνατί ἐκλέψατέ μου τὸ κόν-
δυ τὸ ἀργυροῦν; οὐ τοῦτό ἐστιν, ἐν ᾧ πίνει: ὁ κύριός μου; αὐτὸς
δὲ οἰωνισμῷ οἰωνίζεται ἐν αὐτῷ· πονηρὰ συνετελέσασθε ἃ πεποιή-
6 κατε. Εὑρὼν δὲ αὐτούς, εἶπεν αὐτοῖς κατὰ τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα. Οἱ
7 δὲ εἶπον αὐτῷ· ἱνατί λαλεῖ ὁ κύριός μου κατὰ τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα;
8 μὴ γένοιτο τοῖς παισί σου, ποιῆσαι κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο. Εἰ τὸ
μὲν ἀργύριον, ὃ εὕραμεν ἐν τοῖς μαρσίπποις ἡμῶν, ἀπεστρέψα-
μεν πρός σε ἐκ γῆς Χαναάν, πῶς ἂν κλέψαιμεν ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ
9 κυρίου σου ἀργύριον ἢ χρυσίον; Παρ’ ᾧ ἂν εὑρεθῇ τὸ κόνδυ τῶν
παίδων σου, ἀποθνησκέτω· καὶ ἡμεῖς δὲ ἐσόμεθα παῖδες τῷ κυ-
10 ρίῳ ἡμῶν. Ὁ δὲ εἶπε· καὶ νῦν ὡς λέγετε, οὕτως ἔσται· ὁ ἄν-
θρωπος παρ’ ᾧ ἂν εὑρεθῇ τὸ κόνδυ, αὐτὸς ἔσται μου παῖς· ὑμεῖς
11 δὲ ἔσεσθε καθαροί. Καὶ ἔσπευσαν, καὶ καθείλαν ἕκαστος τὸν μάρ-
σιππον αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, καὶ ἤνοιξαν ἕκαστος τὸν μάρσιππον
12 αὐτοῦ. Ἤρευνα δὲ ἀπὸ τοῦ πρεσβυτέρου ἀρξάμενος, ἕως ἦλθεν ἐπὶ
τὸν νεώτερον· καὶ εὗρε τὸ κόνδυ ἐν τῷ μαρσίππῳ τοῦ Βενιαμίν.
13 Καὶ διέρρηξαν τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπέθηκαν ἕκαστος τὸν μάρ-
σιππον αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὸν ὄνον αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐπέστρεψαν εἰς τὴν πόλιν.
14 Εἰσῆλθε δὲ Ἰούδας καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ πρὸς Ἰωσήφ, ἔτι αὐτοῦ
15 ὄντος ἐκεῖ, καὶ ἔπεσον ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν. Εἶπε δὲ αὐ-
τοῖς Ἰωσήφ· τί τὸ πρᾶγμα τοῦτο ὃ ἐποιήσατε; οὐκ οἴδατε ὅτι οἰω-
16 νισμῷ οἰωνίεται ἄνθρωπος, οἷος ἐγώ; Εἶπε δὲ Ἰούδας· τί ἀντε-
ροῦμεν τῷ κυρίῳ, ἢ τί λαλήσωμεν, ἢ τί δικαιωθῶμεν; ὁ δὲ Θεὸς

**Chapter 44**

1 And Joseph commanded him that was over his house, saying, “Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much as they may carry, and put every man’s silver upon the mouth of his sack.
2 And my silver cup, put ye it into the sack of the youngest, and the price of his grain.”

3 And it came to pass according to the word of Joseph, as he had said. When the morning had dawned,
4 the men were sent away, they and their asses. And when they were gone out of the city, they were not yet far off; and Joseph said unto him that was over his house, saying, “Arise, pursue after these men, and thou shalt overtake them, and thou shalt say unto them, ‘Wherefore have ye rendered [me] evil for good?
5 Wherefore have ye stolen my silver cup? Is not this that in which my lord drinketh? And whereby he surely divineth? Ye have wrought evil in that which ye have done.’”

6 And when he found them, he spake unto them these same words.
7 And they said unto him, “Wherefore speaketh my lord such words as these?
8 God forbid that thy servants should do such a thing! Behold, the silver which we found in our sacks, we returned again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal silver or gold out of thy lord’s house?
9 With whomsoever of thy servants the cup shall be found, let him die; and we also will be bondservants unto our lord.”

10 And he said, “Now also, as ye have spoken, so shall it be. The man with whom the cup shall be found, he shall be my bondservant; and ye shall be blameless.”
11 Then they made haste, and every man took down his sack to the ground, and every man opened his sack.
12 And he searched, beginning at the eldest, and leaving off at the youngest; and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.
13 Then they rent their clothes, and every man laded his ass, and returned unto the city.

14 And Judah and his brethren came into Joseph’s [house]; for he was yet there, and they fell before him on the ground.
15 And Joseph said unto them, “What deed is this that ye have done? Know ye not that such a man as I can surely divine?”
16 And Judah said, “What shall we say unto my lord? or what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants.”
