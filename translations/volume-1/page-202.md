ΚΕΦ. Θʹ. ΛΕΥΪΤΙΚΟΝ
ὥς ἐνετείλατο Κύριος (τῷ Μωυσῇ). Καὶ προσῆλθεν Ἀαρὼν πρὸς 8
τὸ θυσιαστήριον, καὶ ἔσφαξε τὸ μοσχάριον τὸ περὶ τῆς ἁμαρτίας
αὑτοῦ· καὶ προσήνεγκαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἀαρὼν τὸ αἷμα πρὸς αὑτόν, 9
ἔβαψε τὸν δάκτυλον αὑτοῦ εἰς τὸ αἷμα, καὶ ἐπέθηκεν ἐπὶ τὰ κέ-
ρατα τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου, καὶ τὸ αἷμα ἐξέχεεν ἐπὶ τὴν βάσιν τοῦ
θυσιαστηρίου· καὶ τὸ στέαρ καὶ τοὺς νεφροὺς καὶ τὸν λοβὸν τοῦ 10
ἥπατος τοῦ περὶ τῆς ἁμαρτίας ἀνήνεγκεν ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον, ὅν
τρόπον ἐνετείλατο Κύριος τῷ Μωυσῇ· καὶ τὰ κρέα καὶ τὴν βῦρ- 11
σσαν κατέκαυσεν αὐτὰ πυρὶ ἔξω τῆς παρεμβολῆς. Καὶ ἔσφαξε τὸ 12
ὁλοκαύτωμα· καὶ προσήνεγκαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἀαρὼν τὸ αἷμα πρὸς αὑ-
τόν, καὶ προσήχεεν ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον κύκλῳ· καὶ τὸ ὁλοκαύ- 13
τωμα προσήνεγκαν αὐτῷ κατὰ μέλη αὑτοῦ, καὶ τὴν κεφαλήν, καὶ
ἐπέθηκεν ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον· καὶ ἔπλυνε τὴν κοιλίαν καὶ τοὺς 14
πόδας ὕδατι, καὶ ἐπέθηκεν ἐπὶ τὸ ὁλοκαύτωμα ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστή-
ριον. Καὶ προσήνεγκε τὸ δῶρον τοῦ λαοῦ, καὶ ἔλαβε τὸν χίμα- 15
ρον τὸν περὶ τῆς ἁμαρτίας τοῦ λαοῦ, καὶ ἔσφαξεν αὑτόν, καὶ
ἐκαθάρισε, καθὸ καὶ τὸ πρῶτον. Καὶ προσήνεγκε τὸ ὁλοκαύτωμα, 16
καὶ ἐποίησεν αὐτὸ ὡς καθήκει. Καὶ προσήνεγκε τὴν θυσίαν, καὶ 17
ἔπλησεν τὰς χεῖρας αὑτοῦ ἀπ᾿ αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐπέθηκεν ἐπὶ τὸ θυσια-
στήριον χωρὶς τοῦ ὁλοκαυτώματος τοῦ πρωϊνοῦ. Καὶ ἔσφαξε τὸν 18
μόσχον, καὶ τὸν κριὸν τῆς θυσίας τοῦ σωτηρίου τῆς τοῦ λαοῦ·
καὶ προσήνεγκαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἀαρὼν τὸ αἷμα πρὸς αὑτόν, (καὶ προσή-
χεεν αὐτὸ πρὸς τὸ θυσιαστήριον κύκλῳ,) καὶ τὸ στέαρ τὸ ἀπὸ 19
τοῦ μόσχου καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ κριοῦ, τὴν ὀσφῦν, καὶ τὸ στέαρ τὸ κα-
τακαλύπτον ἐπὶ τῆς κοιλίας, καὶ τοὺς δύο νεφρούς, καὶ τὸ στέαρ
τὸ ἐπ᾿ αὑτῶν, καὶ τὸν λοβὸν τὸν ἐπὶ τοῦ ἥπατος· καὶ ἐπέθηκε 20
τὰ στέατα ἐπὶ τὰ στηθύνια, καὶ ἀνήνεγκε τὰ στέατα ἐπὶ τὸ θυ-
σιαστήριον. Καὶ τὸ στηθύνιον, καὶ τὸν βραχίονα τὸν δεξιὸν ἀφεῖ- 21
λεν Ἀαρὼν ἀφαίρεμα ἔναντι Κυρίου, ὃν τρόπον συνέταξε Κύριος
τῷ Μωυσῇ. Καὶ ἐξάρας Ἀαρὼν τὰς χεῖρας αὑτοῦ ἐπὶ τὸν λαόν, 22
εὐλόγησεν αὑτοὺς· καὶ κατέβη ποιήσας τὸ περὶ τῆς ἁμαρτίας, καὶ
τὰ ὁλοκαυτώματα, καὶ τὰ τοῦ σωτηρίου. Καὶ εἰσῆλθε Μωυσῆς 23
καὶ Ἀαρὼν εἰς τὴν σκηνὴν τοῦ μαρτυρίου, καὶ ἐξελθόντες, ηὐλό-
γησαν πάντα τὸν λαόν· καὶ ὤφθη ἡ δόξα Κυρίου παντὶ τῷ λαῷ.
Καὶ ἐξῆλθε πῦρ παρὰ Κυρίου, καὶ κατέφαγε τὰ ἐπὶ τοῦ θυσια- 24

CHAPTER 9. LEVITICUS

8 as the Lord commanded (to Moses). And Aaron drew nigh unto the altar, and slew the calf for his sin-offering.
9 And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him, and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood upon the base of the altar.
10 And the fat, and the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver from the sin-offering, he brought up upon the altar, even as the Lord commanded Moses.
11 And the flesh and the hide he burned with fire outside the camp.
12 And he slew the burnt offering; and the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him, and he poured it upon the altar round about.
13 And they brought the burnt offering unto him, according to its parts, and the head, and he laid them upon the altar.
14 And he washed the entrails and the feet with water, and placed them upon the burnt offering upon the altar.
15 And he brought the offering of the people, and took the kid of the goats for the sin-offering of the people, and slew it, and cleansed it, even as the first [one].
16 And he brought the burnt offering, and performed it as was fitting.
17 And he brought the sacrifice, and filled his hands from it, and laid it upon the altar, apart from the morning burnt offering.
18 And he slew the calf, and the ram for the sacrifice of the peace offering of the people.
19 And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him, (and he poured it upon the altar round about,) and the fat from the calf and from the ram, the rump, and the fat that covereth the belly, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the lobe that is upon the liver.
20 And he put the fats upon the breasts, and brought up the fats upon the altar.
21 And Aaron removed the breast and the right shoulder as a heave offering before the Lord, even as the Lord commanded Moses.
22 And Aaron lifted up his hands upon the people, and blessed them; and he came down, having performed the sin-offering, and the burnt offerings, and the peace offerings.
23 And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of testimony, and when they came out, they blessed all the people; and the glory of the Lord appeared unto all the people.
24 And there came out fire from before the Lord, and consumed upon the altar, both the burnt offerings and the fats; and all the people saw, and were amazed, and fell upon their faces.
