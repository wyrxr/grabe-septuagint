ΚΕΦ. ΛΓʹ. ΛΔʹ.                  ΑΡΙΘΜΟΙ             301
καὶ ἐξαιρεῖτε πάσας τὰς σκοπιὰς αὐτῶν, καὶ πάντα τὰ εἴδωλα τὰ
ἐγκορυφωτὰ αὐτῶν ἀπολεῖτε αὐτά, καὶ πάσας τὰς στήλας αὐτῶν ἐξαιρεῖτε· καὶ ἀπολεῖτε τοὺς κατοικοῦντας τὴν γῆν, καὶ κατοικήσετε 53
ἐν αὐτῇ· ὑμῖν γὰρ δέδωκα τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν ἐν κλήρῳ. Καὶ κατα- 54
κληρονομήσετε τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν κληρωτὶ κατὰ φυλὰς ὑμῶν· τοῖς
πλείσσι πληθυνεῖτε τὴν κατάσχεσιν αὐτῶν, καὶ τοῖς ἐλάττοσιν ἐλατ-
τώσετε τὴν κατάσχεσιν αὐτῶν· εἰς ὃ ἂν ἐξέλθῃ τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ,
ἐκεῖ αὐτοῦ ἔσται ὁ κλῆρος· κατὰ φυλὰς πατριῶν ὑμῶν κληρονο-
μήσετε. Ἐὰν δὲ μὴ ἀπολέσητε τοὺς κατοικοῦντας ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς 55
ἀπὸ προσώπου ὑμῶν, καὶ ἔσται ὅσους ἂν καταλείπητε ἐξ αὐτῶν,
σκόλοπες ἐν τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς ὑμῶν, καὶ βολίδες ἐν ταῖς πλευραῖς
ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐχθρεύσουσιν ὑμῖν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, ἐφ᾿ ἣν ὑμεῖς κατοικήσετε·
καὶ ἔσται καθότι διεγνώκειν τοῦ ποιῆσαι αὐτοῖς, ποιήσω ὑμῖν. 56

1 ΚΑΙ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, λέγων· ἐντεῖλαι τοῖς 2
υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐρεῖς πρὸς αὐτούς· ὅτι ὑμεῖς εἰσπορεύεσθε εἰς
τὴν γῆν Χαναάν, αὕτη ἡ γῆ ἔσται ὑμῖν εἰς κληρονομίαν, γῆ Χαναὰν σὺν τοῖς ὁρίοις αὐτῆς. Καὶ ἔσται ὑμῖν τὸ κλίτος τὸ πρὸς 3
λίβα ἀπὸ ἐρήμου Σὶν ἕως ἐχόμενον Ἐδώμ, καὶ ἔσται ὑμῖν τὰ ὅρια
πρὸς λίβα, ἀπὸ μέρους τῆς θαλάσσης τῆς ἁλυκῆς ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν.
Καὶ κυκλώσει ὑμᾶς τὰ ὅρια ἀπὸ λιβὸς πρὸς ἀνάβασιν Ἀκραβείν, 4
καὶ παρελεύσεστε Σεννὰχ, καὶ ἔσται ἡ διέξοδος αὐτοῦ πρὸς λίβα
Κάδης τοῦ Βαρνῆ, καὶ ἐξελεύσεστε εἰς ἔπαυλιν Ἀρὰδ, καὶ παρε-
λεύσεται Ἀσεμωνᾶ. Καὶ κυκλώσει τὰ ὅρια ἀπὸ Ἀσεμωνᾶ χείμαρ- 5
ρον Αἰγύπτου, καὶ ἔσται ἡ διέξοδος αὐτοῦ ἡ θάλασσα. Καὶ τὰ 6
ὅρια τῆς θαλάσσης ἔσται ὑμῖν θάλασσα ἡ μεγάλη δριεῖ, τοῦτο
ἔσται ὑμῖν τὸ ὅριον τῆς θαλάσσης. Καὶ τοῦτο ἔσται ὑμῖν τὰ ὅ- 7
ρια πρὸς βορρᾶν· ἀπὸ τῆς θαλάσσης τῆς μεγάλης καταμετρήσετε
ὑμῖν αὐτοῖς παρὰ τὸ ὄρος τὸ ὄρος· καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ ὄρους τὸ ὄρος 8
καταμετρήσετε αὐτοῖς, εἰσπορευομένων εἰς Αἱμὰθ, καὶ ἔσται ἡ διέ-
ξοδος αὐτοῦ τὰ ὅρια Σαδαδάκ· καὶ ἐξελεύσεται τὰ ὅρια Ζεφρωνὰ, 9
καὶ ἔσται ἡ διέξοδος αὐτοῦ Ἀσερναΐν· τοῦτο ἔσται ὑμῖν ὅρια ἀπὸ
βορρᾶ. Καὶ καταμετρήσετε ὑμῖν ἑαυτοῖς τὰ ὅρια ἀνατολῶν ἀπὸ Ἀ- 10
σερναΐν· Σεφαμά· καὶ καταθήσεται τὰ ὅρια ἀπὸ Σεφαμὰ Ἀρβηλὰ 11

### CHAPTER 33.

52 And ye shall pluck out all their shrines, and all their carved images which are uplifted ye shall destroy them, and all their pillars ye shall pluck out.
53 And ye shall destroy the inhabitants of the land, and ye shall dwell therein; for unto you have I given their land as an inheritance.
54 And ye shall inherit their land by lot according to your tribes; to the many ye shall increase their possession, and to the few ye shall diminish their possession. Wheresoever his name shall go forth, there shall his lot be; according to the tribes of your fathers’ houses shall ye inherit.
55 But if ye fail to destroy the inhabitants of the land from before your face, then it shall be that as many of them as ye leave, they shall be thorns in your eyes, and pricks in your sides; and they shall be enemies unto you in the land wherein ye shall dwell.
56 And it shall come to pass, that as I had purposed to do unto them, so will I do unto you.

### CHAPTER 34.

1 AND the LORD spake unto Moses, saying:
2 “Command the children of Israel, and thou shalt say unto them: When ye enter into the land of Canaan, this shall be the land for you as an inheritance, even the land of Canaan with its borders.
3 And your southern border shall be from the wilderness of Sin unto the side of Edom; and your southern boundary shall be from the side of the Salt Sea, from the east.
4 And the border shall turn for you from the south, toward the ascent of Akrabbein, and ye shall pass on to Sennach, and its outlet shall be southward to Kadesh of Barne; and ye shall go forth to the encampment of Arad, and it shall pass on to Azmona.
5 And the border shall turn from Azmona to the brook of Egypt, and its outlet shall be the sea.
6 And the sea border shall be for you the Great Fierce Sea; this shall be your boundary of the sea.
7 And this shall be for you the border toward the north: from the Great Sea shall ye mark out for yourselves along the mountain, the mountain.
8 And from the mountain, the mountain, shall ye mark it out, [leading] as one enters into Hamath; and its outlet shall be the borders of Sadadak.
9 And the border shall go forth to Zephrona, and its outlet shall be Asernain; this shall be for you the border from the north.
10 And ye shall mark out for yourselves the eastern border from Asernain to Sephama.
11 And the border shall descend from Sephama to Arbel.
