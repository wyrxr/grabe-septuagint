**2.** μετὰ σοῦ, ὥστε μὴ παραδοῦναί με τὴν Μαδιὰμ ἐν χειρὶ αὐτῶν,
μήποτε καυχήσηται Ἰσραὴλ ἐπ᾿ ἐμέ, λέγων· ἡ χείρ μου ἔσωσέ
με. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς αὐτόν· λάλησον δὴ εἰς τὰ ὦτα τοῦ
**3.** λαοῦ, λέγων· τίς δειλὸς καὶ φοβούμενος; ἀποστραφήτω. Καὶ ἐξώρμησεν ἀπὸ τοῦ ὄρους τοῦ Γαλαάδ· καὶ ἀπεστράφησαν ἀπὸ τοῦ λαοῦ
εἴκοσι καὶ δύο χιλιάδες, καὶ δέκα χιλιάδες ὑπελείφθησαν. Καὶ
**4.** εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Γεδεών· ἔτι ὁ λαὸς πολὺς· κατάγαγε αὐτοὺς
εἰς τὸ ὕδωρ, καὶ δοκιμῶ αὐτοὺς σοι ἐκεῖθεν· καὶ ἔσται ὃν ἐὰν
εἴπω πρὸς σε, οὗτος πορεύσεται μετὰ σοῦ, αὐτὸς πορεύσεται μετὰ
σοῦ· καὶ πάντα ὃν ἐὰν εἴπω σοι, ὅτι οὗτος πορεύσεται μετὰ σοῦ,
αὐτὸς οὐ πορεύσεται μετὰ σοῦ. Καὶ κατεβίβασε τὸν λαὸν εἰς τὸ ὕδωρ·
**5.** καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Γεδεών· πᾶς ὃς ἂν λάψῃ τῇ γλώσσῃ αὐτοῦ
ἐκ τοῦ ὕδατος, ὡς ἐὰν λάψῃ ὁ κύων, στήσεις αὐτὸν κατὰ μόνας·
καὶ πᾶς ὃς ἂν κάμψῃ τὰ γόνατα αὐτοῦ τοῦ πιεῖν, μεταστήσεις
αὐτὸν καθ᾿ αὐτόν. Καὶ ἐγένετο πᾶς ὁ ἀριθμὸς τῶν λαψάντων ἐν
**6.** τῇ χειρὶ αὐτῶν ἐν τῇ γλώσσῃ αὐτῶν, τριακόσιοι ἄνδρες· καὶ πᾶς
ὁ ἐπίλοιπος τοῦ λαοῦ ἐκκάμψαντες ἐπὶ τὰ γόνατα αὐτοῦ, τοῦ πιεῖν
ὕδωρ. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Γεδεών· ἐν τοῖς τριακοσίοις ἀνδράσι
**7.** τοῖς λάψασι σώσω ὑμᾶς, καὶ παραδώσω τὴν Μαδιὰμ ἐν χειρί σου·
καὶ πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ἀποτρεχέτω, ἀνὴρ εἰς τὸν τόπον αὐτοῦ. Καὶ
**8.** ἔλαβον τὸν ἐπισιτισμὸν τοῦ λαοῦ ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτῶν, καὶ τὰς
κερατίνας αὐτῶν, καὶ πάντα ἄνδρα Ἰσραὴλ ἐξαπέστειλεν, ἄνδρα
εἰς τὸ σκήνωμα αὐτοῦ· τῶν δὲ τριακοσίων ἀνδρῶν ἐκράτησεν. δὲ παρεμβολὴ Μαδιὰμ ἦν ὑποκάτωθεν αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ κοιλάδι. Καὶ
**9.** ἐγενήθη ἐν τῇ νυκτὶ ἐκείνῃ, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτὸν Κύριος· ἀνάστα,
κατάβηθι τὸ τάχος εἰς τὴν παρεμβολὴν ἐντεῦθεν, ὅτι παρέδωκα
αὐτὴν ἐν τῇ χειρί σου. Εἰ δὲ φοβῇ σὺ καταβῆναι, κατάβηθι σὺ
**10.** καὶ Φαρὰ τὸ παιδάριόν σου εἰς τὴν παρεμβολήν, καὶ ἀκούσῃ τί
**11.** λαλοῦσι· καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα ἰσχύσουσιν αἱ χεῖρές σου, καὶ καταβήσῃ
ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ. Καὶ κατέβη αὐτὸς καὶ Φαρὰ τὸ παιδάριον αὐτοῦ εἰς μέρος τῶν πεντήκοντα τῶν ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ. Καὶ Μαδιὰμ
**12.** καὶ Ἀμαλὴκ καὶ πάντες υἱοὶ ἀνατολῶν παρεμβεβλήκεισαν ἐν τῇ
κοιλάδι ὡς ἀκρις εἰς πλῆθος, καὶ ταῖς καμήλοις οὐκ ἦν ἀριθμός,
ἀλλ᾿ ἦσαν ὥσπερ ἡ ἄμμος ἡ ἐπὶ τὸ χεῖλος τῆς θαλάσσης εἰς
πλῆθος. Καὶ εἰσῆλθε Γεδεών, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἀνὴρ ἐξηγεῖται τῷ πλησίον

**JUDGES**
**CHAPTER 7.**

**1.** ...in the valley.
**2.** And the Lord said unto Gideon, "The people that are with thee are too many, that I should deliver Midian into their hand; lest Israel vaunt themselves against Me, saying, 'My own hand hath saved me.'
**3.** Now therefore, speak thou unto the ears of the people, saying, 'Whosoever is fearful and trembling, let him turn back.' " And [Gideon] caused them to depart from the mount of Gilead; and there returned of the people twenty and two thousand, and there remained ten thousand.
**4.** And the Lord said unto Gideon, "The people are yet many. Bring them down unto the water, and I will test them for thee there; and it shall be that of whomsoever I say unto thee, 'This one shall go with thee,' the same shall go with thee. And of everyone concerning whom I say unto thee, 'This one shall go with thee,' the same shall not go with thee."
**5.** So he brought down the people unto the water; and the Lord said unto Gideon, "Everyone that lappeth the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set apart by himself; and everyone that boweth down upon his knees to drink, him shalt thou likewise set apart by himself."
**6.** And the number of them that lapped with their hand, with their tongue, was three hundred men. And all the rest of the people bent down upon their knees to drink water.
**7.** And the Lord said unto Gideon, "By the three hundred men who lapped, will I save you, and deliver Midian into thy hand; and let all the [other] people go, every man unto his place."
**8.** And they took the provisions of the people in their hands, and their trumpets. And [Gideon] sent away every man of Israel, each man unto his own tent; but the three hundred men he retained. Now the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley.
**9.** And it came to pass on that night, that the Lord said unto him, "Arise, go down quickly into the camp from hence, for I have delivered it into thy hand.
**10.** But if thou fearest to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant into the camp,
**11.** and thou shalt hear what they speak; and afterward shall thy hands be strengthened, and thou shalt go down into the camp." Then went he down, and Phurah his servant, unto a part of the fifty who were in the camp.
**12.** And Midian and Amalek and all the children of the East lay encamped in the valley as locusts in multitude, and their camels were without number, but were as the sand upon the seashore for multitude.
**13.** And when Gideon came, behold, there was a man telling a dream unto his neighbor, and he said, "Behold, the dream which I dreamed..."
