14 Καὶ φυλάξεσθε τὸ σάββατον, ἔτι ἅγιόν ἐστιν ὑμῖν· ὁ βεβηλῶν αὐτό, θανάτῳ θανατωθήσεται· πᾶς ὅστις ποιήσει ἐν αὐτῷ ἔργον,
15 ἐξολοθρευθήσεται ἡ ψυχὴ ἐκείνη ἐκ μέσου τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτῆς. Ἕξ ἡμέρας ποιήσεις ἔργα, τῇ δὲ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ σάββατα, ἀνάπαυσις ἁγία τῷ Κυρίῳ· πᾶς ὅστις ποιήσει ἔργον τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τοῦ σαββάτου, θανάτῳ θανατωθήσεται.
16 Καὶ φυλάξουσιν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ τὰ σάββατα, ποιεῖν αὐτὰ εἰς τὰς γενεὰς αὐτῶν διαθήκη αἰώνιος.
17 Ἐν ἐμοὶ καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραὴλ σημεῖον ἐστιν αἰώνιον· ὅτι ἐν ἓξ ἡμέραις ἐποίησε Κύριος τόν τε οὐρανὸν καὶ τὴν γῆν, καὶ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ ἐπαύσατο, καὶ κατέπαυσε.
18 Καὶ ἔδωκε Μωσῇ, ἡνίκα κατέπαυσε λαλῶν πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐν τῷ ὄρει τῷ Σινᾷ, τὰς δύο πλάκας τοῦ μαρτυρίου, πλάκας λιθίνας, γεγραμμένας τῷ δακτύλῳ τοῦ Θεοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. ΛΒ΄. XXXII.

1 Καὶ ἰδὼν ὁ λαός, ὅτι κεχρόνικε Μωσῆς καταβῆναι ἐκ τοῦ ὄρους, συνέστη ὁ λαὸς ἐπὶ Ἀαρών, καὶ ἔλεγον αὐτῷ· ἀνάστηθι, καὶ ποίησον ἡμῖν θεούς, οἳ προπορεύσονται ἡμῶν· ὁ γὰρ Μωσῆς οὗτος ὁ ἄνθρωπος, ὃς ἐξήγαγεν ἡμᾶς ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, οὐκ οἴδαμεν τί γέγονεν αὐτῷ.
2 Καὶ λέγει αὐτοῖς Ἀαρών· περιέλεσθε τὰ ἐνώτια τὰ χρυσᾶ τὰ ἐν τοῖς ὠσὶ τῶν γυναικῶν ὑμῶν καὶ θυγατέρων, καὶ ἐνέγκατε πρός με.
3 Καὶ περιείλαντο πᾶς ὁ λαὸς τὰ ἐνώτια τὰ χρυσᾶ τὰ ἐν τοῖς ὠσὶ τῶν γυναικῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἤνεγκαν πρὸς Ἀαρών.
4 Καὶ ἐδέξατο ἐκ τῶν χειρῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔπλασεν αὐτὰ ἐν γραφίδι, καὶ ἐποίησεν αὐτὸ μόσχον χωνευτόν. Καὶ εἶπαν· οὗτοι οἱ θεοί σου Ἰσραήλ, οἵ τινες ἀνεβίβασάν σε ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου.
5 Καὶ ἰδὼν Ἀαρὼν ᾠκοδόμησε θυσιαστήριον κατέναντι αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐκήρυξεν Ἀαρών, λέγων· ἑορτὴ Κυρίου αὔριον.
6 Καὶ ὀρθρίσας τῇ ἐπαύριον, ἀνεβίβασεν ὁλοκαυτώματα, καὶ προσήνεγκε θυσίαν σωτηρίου· καὶ ἐκάθισεν ὁ λαὸς φαγεῖν καὶ πιεῖν, καὶ ἀνέστησαν παίζειν.
7 Καὶ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωσῆν, λέγων· βάδιζε, κατάβηθι τὸ τάχος ἐντεῦθεν· ἠνόμησε γὰρ ὁ λαός σου, οὓς ἐξήγαγες ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου·
8 παρέβησαν ταχὺ ἐκ τῆς ὁδοῦ, ἧς ἐνετείλω αὐτοῖς· ἐποίησαν ἑαυτοῖς μόσχον, καὶ προσκεκυνήκασιν αὐτῷ, καὶ τεθύκασιν αὐτῷ, καὶ εἶπαν· οὗτοι οἱ θεοί σου Ἰσραήλ, οἵ τινες ἀνεβίβασάν σε · ἐκ γῆς

**Translation:**

**Exodus 31**
14 Ye shall keep the Sabbath, for it is holy unto you;
Whosoever shall profane it, he shall surely be put to death:
For every one that doeth any work therein,
Shall that soul be cut off from among his people.

15 Six days shall ye do your works,
But the seventh day is the Sabbath, a holy rest unto the Lord;
Whosoever doeth any work on the day of the Sabbath,
He shall surely be put to death.

16 And the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbaths,
To observe them throughout their generations,
[As] an everlasting covenant.

17 Between Me and the children of Israel it is an everlasting sign;
For in six days the Lord made the heaven and the earth,
And on the seventh day He rested, and ceased [from His work].

18 And when He had ceased speaking with him upon Mount Sinai,
He gave unto Moses the two tables of the Testimony,
Tables of stone, written with the finger of God.

**Exodus 32**
1 Now when the people saw that Moses tarried to come down from the mount,
The people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and they said unto him,
"Arise, and make us gods, which shall go before us;
For as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt,
We know not what is become of him."

2 And Aaron said unto them,
"Take off the golden earrings which are in the ears of your wives and your daughters,
And bring them unto me."

3 So all the people took off the golden earrings which were in the ears of their wives,
And brought them unto Aaron.

4 And he received them at their hands, and fashioned them with a graving tool,
And made thereof a molten calf.
And they said, "These be thy gods, O Israel,
Which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt!"

5 And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it;
And Aaron made proclamation, saying, "Tomorrow shall be a feast to the Lord!"

6 And they rose up early on the morrow,
And offered up burnt offerings, and brought sacrifices of peace offerings;
And the people sat down to eat and to drink,
And rose up to revel.

7 Then the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,
"Go, get thee down quickly from hence;
For thy people hath dealt lawlessly,
Whom thou didst bring out of the land of Egypt;

8 They have quickly turned aside from the way which I commanded them.
They have made for themselves a calf,
And have bowed down to it, and have sacrificed unto it,
And have said, 'These be thy gods, O Israel,
Which brought thee up [out] of the land..."
