Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, λέγων· Τοῦτο τὸ δῶρον Ἀαρὼν καὶ τῶν 20
υἱῶν αὐτοῦ, ὃ προσσοίσουσι Κυρίῳ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ, ᾗ ἂν χρίσῃς αὖ-
τὸν· τὸ δέκατον τοῦ οἰφὶ σεμιδάλεως θυσίαν διαπαντὸς, τὸ ἥμισυ
αὐτῆς τὸ πρωὶ, καὶ τὸ ἥμισυ αὐτῆς τὸ δειλινόν· ἐπὶ τηγάνου ἐν 21
ἐλαίῳ ποιηθήσεται πεφυραμένη ὅση αὐτὴν ἐρικτὰ, θυσίαν ἐκ κλασ-
μάτων, θυσίαν εἰς ὀσμὴν εὐωδίας Κυρίῳ. Καὶ ὁ ἱερεὺς ὁ χριστὸς 22
ἀντ’ αὐτοῦ ἐκ τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ ποιήσει αὐτὴν· νόμος αἰώνιος τῷ
Κυρίῳ, ἅπαν ἐπιτελεσθήσεται· καὶ πᾶσα θυσία ἱερέως ὁλόκαυτος 23
ἔσται, καὶ οὐ βρωθήσεται. Καὶ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, 24
λέγων· λάλησον Ἀαρὼν καὶ τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ, λέγων· οὗτος ὁ 25
νόμος τῆς ἁμαρτίας· ἐν τόπῳ ᾧ σφάζουσι τὸ ὁλοκαύτωμα, σφά-
ζουσι τὰς ἁμαρτίας ἔναντι Κυρίου· ἁγία ἁγίων ἐστίν. Ὁ ἱερεὺς 26
ὁ ἀναφέρων αὐτὴν, ἔδεται αὐτὴν ἐν τόπῳ ἁγίῳ βρωθήσεται, ἐν
αὐλῇ τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου. Πᾶς ὁ ἁπτόμενος τῶν κρεῶν αὐ- 27
τῆς, ἁγιασθήσεται· καὶ ᾧ ἐὰν ἐπιδαντισθῇ ἀπὸ τοῦ αἵματος αὐ-
τῆς ἐπὶ τὸ ἱμάτιον, ὃ ἐὰν ραντισθῇ ἐπ’ αὐτὸ, πλυθήσεται ἐν τόπῳ
ἁγίῳ. Καὶ σκεῦος ὀστράκινον, οὗ ἐὰν ἐψηθῇ ἐν αὐτῷ, συντριβή- 28
σεται· ἐὰν δὲ ἐν σκεύει χαλκῷ ἐψηθῇ, ἐκτρίψει αὐτὸ, καὶ ἐκ-
πλύσει ὕδατι. Πᾶς ἄρσην ἐν τοῖς ἱερεῦσι φάγεται αὐτά· ἁγία ἁ- 29
γίων ἐστὶ Κυρίου. Καὶ πάντα τὰ περὶ τῆς ἁμαρτίας, ὧν ἂν εἰσ- 30
ενεχθῇ ἀπὸ τοῦ αἵματος αὐτῶν εἰς τὴν σκηνὴν τοῦ μαρτυρίου
ἐξιλάσασθαι ἐν τῷ ἁγίῳ οὐ βρωθήσεται, ἐν πυρὶ κατακαυθήσεται.

ΚΕΦ. Ζ΄. VII.

ΚΑΙ οὗτος ὁ νόμος τοῦ κριοῦ τοῦ περὶ τῆς πλημμελείας· 1
ἁγία ἁγίων ἐστίν. Ἐν τόπῳ οὗ σφάζουσι τὸ ὁλοκαύτωμα, σφά- 2
ζουσι τὸν κριὸν τῆς πλημμελείας ἔναντι Κυρίου· καὶ τὸ αἷμα αὐ-
τοῦ προσχεεῖ ἐπὶ τὴν βάσιν τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου κύκλῳ· καὶ πᾶν τὸ 3
στέαρ αὐτοῦ προσσοίσει ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὴν ὀσφῦν, καὶ πᾶν τὸ στέαρ
τὸ κατακαλύπτον τὰ ἐνδόσθια, καὶ πᾶν τὸ στέαρ τὸ ἐπὶ τῶν ἐν-
δοσθίων, καὶ τοὺς δύο νεφροὺς, καὶ τὸ στέαρ τὸ ἐπ’ αὐτῶν, τὸ 4
ἐπὶ τῶν μηρίων, καὶ τὸν λοβὸν τὸν ἐπὶ τοῦ ἥπατος σὺν τοῖς νε-
φροῖς περιελεῖ αὐτά· καὶ ἀνοίσει αὐτὰ ὁ ἱερεὺς ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστή- 5
ριον, κάρπωμα τῷ Κυρίῳ· περὶ πλημμελείας ἐστί. Πᾶς ἄρσην ἐκ 6
τῶν ἱερέων ἔδεται αὐτὰ, ἐν τόπῳ ἁγίῳ ἔδονται αὐτά· ἅγια ἁγίων

#### CHAPTER 6

<sup>20</sup>The Lord spake unto Moses, saying: "This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the Lord on the day when thou dost anoint him:
<sup>21</sup>The tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a perpetual sacrifice, half thereof in the morning, and half thereof in the evening. It shall be made in a pan with oil, mixed, as much as it [is in] broken pieces, a sacrifice of broken pieces, a sacrifice for a sweet savor unto the Lord.
<sup>22</sup>And the priest that is anointed, who shall be in his stead from among his sons, he shall make it; [it is] an everlasting statute for the Lord; it shall be wholly offered;
<sup>23</sup>And every sacrifice of a priest shall be a whole burnt offering, and it shall not be eaten.

<sup>24</sup>And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying:
<sup>25</sup>"Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying: This is the law of the sin offering. In the place where they slay the whole burnt offering, they shall slay the sin offerings before the Lord; it is a most holy [thing].
<sup>26</sup>The priest that offereth it shall eat it; in a holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of testimony.
<sup>27</sup>Whosoever toucheth the flesh thereof shall be holy; and upon whatsoever [object] of its blood shall be sprinkled upon the garment, whatsoever [stain] is sprinkled upon it, it shall be washed in a holy place.
<sup>28</sup>And a vessel of earthenware, wherein it is boiled, shall be broken; but if it be boiled in a vessel of bronze, it shall scour it, and wash it with water.
<sup>29</sup>Every male among the priests shall eat thereof; it is a most holy [thing] of the Lord.
<sup>30</sup>And as for every [offering] concerning sin, from whose blood aught shall be brought into the tabernacle of testimony to make atonement in the holy [place], it shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire."

#### CHAPTER 7

<sup>1</sup>Now this is the law of the ram of the trespass offering; it is a most holy [thing].
<sup>2</sup>In the place where they slay the whole burnt offering, they shall slay the ram of the trespass offering before the Lord; and its blood he shall pour out upon the base of the altar round about.
<sup>3</sup>And all its fat he shall offer from it: and the fat tail, and all the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,
<sup>4</sup>And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, that which is on the flanks, and the lobe upon the liver, with the kidneys, he shall remove these.
<sup>5</sup>And the priest shall bring them up upon the altar, as an offering by fire unto the Lord; it is for a trespass offering.
<sup>6</sup>Every male from among the priests shall eat thereof; in a holy place shall they eat them; it is a most holy [thing].
