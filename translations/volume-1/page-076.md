ΚΕΦ. ΛΔ΄.                                                ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ    61
πρὸς Ἑμὼρ τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ, λέγων· λάβε μοι τὴν παιδίσκην
ταύτην εἰς γυναῖκα. Ἰακὼβ δὲ ἤκουσεν, ὅτι ἐμίανεν ὁ υἱὸς Ἑ- 5
μὼρ Δείναν τὴν θυγατέρα αὐτοῦ· οἱ δὲ υἱοὶ αὐτοῦ ἦσαν μετὰ τῶν
κτη̄νῶν αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ· παρεσιώπησε δὲ Ἰακὼβ, ἕως τοῦ ἐλ-
θεῖν αὐτούς. Ἐξῆλθε δὲ Ἑμὼρ ὁ πατὴρ Συχὲμ πρὸς Ἰακὼβ, 6
λαλῆσαι αὐτῷ. Οἱ δὲ υἱοὶ Ἰακὼβ ἦλθον ἐκ τοῦ πεδίου· ὡς δὲ 7
ἤκουσαν, κατενύχθησαν οἱ ἄνδρες, καὶ λυπηρὸν ἦν αὐτοῖς σφό-
δρα, ὅτι ἄσχημον ἐποίησε (Συχὲμ) ἐν Ἰσραήλ, κοιμηθεὶς μετὰ
τῆς θυγατρὸς Ἰακὼβ, καὶ οὐχ οὕτως ἔσται. Καὶ ἐλάλησεν αὐτοῖς 8
Ἑμώρ, λέγων· Συχὲμ ὁ υἱός μου προσεῖλατο τῇ ψυχῇ τὴν θυ-
γατέρα ὑμῶν· δότε οὖν αὐτὴν αὐτῷ γυναῖκα. Καὶ ἐπιγαμβρεύσατε 9
ἡμῖν· τὰς θυγατέρας ὑμῶν δότε ἡμῖν, καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας ἡμῶν
λάβετε τοῖς υἱοῖς ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐν ἡμῖν κατοικεῖτε· καὶ (ἰδοὺ) ἡ γῆ 10
πλατεῖα ἐναντίον ὑμῶν, κατοικεῖτε καὶ ἐμπορεύεσθε ἐπ᾿ αὐτῆς, καὶ
ἐγκτᾶσθε ἐν αὐτῇ. Εἶπε δὲ Συχὲμ πρὸς τὸν πατέρα αὐτῆς, καὶ πρὸς 11
τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτῆς· εὕροιμι χάριν ἐναντίον ὑμῶν, καὶ ἃ ἐὰν εἴ-
πητε ἡμῖν , δώσομεν· πληθύνατε τὴν φερνὴν καὶ δόμα σφόδρα, καὶ 12
δώσω καθότι ἂν εἴπητε μοι , καὶ δώσετε μοι τὴν παῖδα ταύτην εἰς
γυναῖκα. Ἀπεκρίθησαν δὲ οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰακὼβ τῷ Συχὲμ καὶ Ἑμὼρ τῷ 13
πατρὶ αὐτοῦ μετὰ δόλου, καὶ ἐλάλησαν αὐτοῖς, ὅτι ἐμίανε Δείναν
τὴν ἀδελφὴν αὐτῶν. Καὶ εἶπαν αὐτοῖς Συμεὼν καὶ Λευῒ οἱ ἀδελ- 14
φοὶ Δείνας, υἱοὶ δὲ Λείας· οὐ δυνησόμεθα ποιῆσαι τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦ-
το, δοῦναι τὴν ἀδελφὴν ἡμῶν ἀνθρώπῳ, ὃς ἔχει ἀκροβυστίαν·
ἔστι γὰρ ὄνειδος ἡμῖν. Μόνον ἐν τούτῳ ὁμοιωθησόμεθα ὑμῖν, καὶ 15
κατοικήσωμεν ἐν ὑμῖν, ἐὰν γένησθε ὡς ἡμεῖς καὶ ὑμεῖς, ἐν τῷ πε-
ριτμηθῆναι ὑμῶν πᾶν ἀρσενικὸν· καὶ δώσομεν τὰς θυγατέρας ἡμῶν 16
ὑμῖν, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν θυγατέρων ὑμῶν ληψόμεθα ἡμῖν γυναῖκας, καὶ
εἰκήσομεν παρ᾽ ὑμῖν, καὶ ἐσόμεθα ὡς γένος ἕν. Ἐὰν δὲ μὴ εἰσ- 17
ακούσητε ἡμῶν τοῦ περιτέμνεσθαι, λαβόντες τὰς θυγατέρας ἡμῶν
ἀπελευσόμεθα. Καὶ ἤρεσαν οἱ λόγοι ἐναντίον Ἑμὼρ, καὶ ἐναντίον 18
Συχὲμ τοῦ υἱοῦ Ἑμώρ. Καὶ οὐκ ἐχρόνισεν ὁ νεανίσκος τοῦ ποιῆ- 19
σαι τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο· ἐνέκειτο γὰρ τῇ θυγατρὶ Ἰακώβ· αὐτὸς δὲ ἦν
ἐνδοξότατος πάντων τῶν ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ. Ἦλθε 20
δὲ Ἑμὼρ καὶ Συχὲμ ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ πρὸς τὴν πύλην τῆς πόλεως
αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐλάλησαν πρὸς τοὺς ἄνδρας τῆς πόλεως αὐτῶν, λέγοντες·
οἱ ἄνθρωποι οὗτοι εἰρηνικοί εἰσι, μεθ᾽ ἡμῶν οἰκήτωσαν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, 21

**Chapter 34**

4 (cont.) unto Hamor his father, saying, "Take for me this maiden as a wife."

5 Now Jacob heard that the son of Hamor had defiled Dinah his daughter; and his sons were with his livestock in the field. And Jacob held his peace until they came.

6 Then Hamor, the father of Shechem, went out unto Jacob to speak with him.

7 And the sons of Jacob came from the field, and when they heard [it], the men were deeply grieved, and it was very grievous unto them; for (Shechem) had wrought a shameful thing in Israel by lying with the daughter of Jacob, and such ought not to be.

8 And Hamor spoke unto them, saying, "Shechem my son hath set his affection upon your daughter with [his] very soul; therefore, give her unto him for a wife.

9 And intermarry ye with us: give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters for your sons.

10 And dwell ye among us. And (behold) the land is spacious before you; dwell ye and trade therein, and acquire possessions within it."

11 Then Shechem said unto her father and unto her brothers, "May I find favor in your sight; and whatsoever ye shall say unto us, we will give [it].

12 Multiply the dowry and the gift greatly, and I will give whatsoever ye shall say unto me; and ye shall give me this maiden as a wife."

13 And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father with deceit, and spoke unto them because he had defiled Dinah their sister.

14 And Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, the sons of Leah, said unto them, "We cannot do this thing, to give our sister unto a man who hath an uncircumcision; for it is a reproach unto us.

15 Only in this way shall we be made like unto you, and shall dwell among you, if ye become as we are—yea, even yourselves—by having every male among you circumcised.

16 Then shall we give our daughters unto you, and we shall take for us wives from among your daughters, and we shall settle ourselves among you, and we shall be as one people.

17 But if ye hearken not unto us to be circumcised, then shall we take our daughters and depart."

18 And the words pleased Hamor, and Shechem, Hamor's son.

19 And the young man tarried not to do this thing, for he was greatly devoted unto Jacob's daughter; and he was the most honored of all those in his father's house.

20 Then Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and spoke unto the men of their city, saying:

21 "These men are peaceable; let them dwell with us upon the land."
