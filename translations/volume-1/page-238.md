αὐτόν, ἢ ἀπὸ τῶν οἰκείων τῶν σαρκῶν αὐτοῦ ἐκ τῆς φυλῆς (τῆς
σαρκὸς) αὐτοῦ λυτρώσεται αὐτόν· ἐὰν δὲ εὐπορηθεὶς ταῖς χερσὶν
αὐτοῦ, λυτρώσεται ἑαυτόν. Καὶ συλλογιεῖται πρὸς τὸν κεκτημένον 50
αὐτὸν ἀπὸ τοῦ ἔτους οὗ ἀπέδοτο ἑαυτὸν αὐτῷ ἕως τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ
τῆς ἀφέσεως, καὶ ἔσται τὸ ἀργύριον τῆς πράσεως αὐτοῦ ὡς μισθίου·
ἔτος ἐξ ἔτους ἔσται μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ. Ἐὰν δὲ (τινι) πλέον τῶν 51
ἐτῶν ᾖ, πρὸς ταῦτα ἀποδώσει τὰ λύτρα αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀργυρίου
τῆς πράσεως αὐτοῦ· ἐὰν δὲ ὀλίγον καταλειφθῇ ἀπὸ τῶν ἐτῶν εἰς 52
τὸν ἐνιαυτὸν τῆς ἀφέσεως, καὶ συλλογιεῖται αὐτῷ κατὰ τὰ ἔτη
αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀποδώσει τὰ λύτρα αὐτοῦ ὡς μισθωτός· ἐνιαυτὸν ἐξ 53
ἐνιαυτοῦ ἔσται μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ· οὐ κατατενεῖς αὐτὸν ἐν τῷ μόχθῳ ἐνώπιον
σου. Ἐὰν δὲ μὴ λυτρῶται κατὰ ταῦτα, ἐξελεύσεται ἐν τῷ 54
ἐνιαυτῷ τῆς ἀφέσεως αὐτὸς καὶ τὰ παιδία αὐτοῦ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ· ὅτι 55
ἐμοί οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ οἰκέται, παῖδές μου οὗτοι εἰσιν, οὓς ἐξήγαγον
ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου· ἐγὼ Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν.

ΚΕΦ. Κς΄. XXVI.
Οὐ ποιήσετε ὑμῖν (αὐτοῖς) χειροποίητα, οὐδὲ γλυπτόν, οὐδὲ 1
στήλην ἀναστήσετε ὑμῖν, οὐδὲ λίθον σκοπὸν θήσετε ἐν τῇ γῇ ὑμῶν,
προσκυνῆσαι αὐτῷ· ἐγὼ (εἰμι) Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ὑμῶν. Τὰ 2
σάββατά μου φυλάξεσθε, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ἁγίων μου φοβηθήσεσθε·
ἐγὼ (εἰμι) Κύριος. Ἐὰν ἐν τοῖς προστάγμασί μου πορεύσησθε, καὶ 3
τὰς ἐντολάς μου φυλάσσησθε, καὶ ποιήσητε αὐτάς, καὶ δώσω τὸν 4
ὑετὸν ὑμῖν ἐν καιρῷ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἡ γῆ δώσει τὰ γεννήματα αὐτῆς,
καὶ τὰ ξύλα τῶν πεδίων ἀποδώσει τὸν καρπὸν αὐτῶν· καὶ καταλήψεται 5
ὑμῖν ὁ ἀμητὸς τὸν τρυγητόν, καὶ ὁ τρυγητὸς καταλήψεται
τὸν σπόρον, καὶ φάγεσθε τὸν ἄρτον ὑμῶν εἰς πλησμονήν, καὶ
κατοικήσετε μετὰ ἀσφαλείας ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς ὑμῶν, (καὶ πόλεμος οὐ
διελεύσεται διὰ τῆς γῆς ὑμῶν)· καὶ δώσω εἰρήνην 6
ἐν τῇ γῇ ὑμῶν, καὶ κοιμηθήσεσθε, καὶ οὐκ ἔσται ὑμᾶς ὁ ἐκφοβῶν·
καὶ ἀπολῶ θηρία πονηρὰ ἐκ τῆς γῆς ὑμῶν· καὶ πόλεμος 7
οὐ διελεύσεται διὰ τῆς γῆς ὑμῶν· καὶ διώξεσθε τοὺς ἐχθροὺς ὑμῶν,
καὶ πεσοῦνται ἐναντίον ὑμῶν φόνῳ. Καὶ διώξονται ἐξ ὑμῶν 8
πέντε ἑκατόν, καὶ ἑκατὸν ἐξ ὑμῶν διώξονται μυριάδας, καὶ πεσοῦνται
οἱ ἐχθροὶ ὑμῶν ἐναντίον ὑμῶν μαχαίρᾳ. Καὶ ἐπιβλέψω 9

<br/>
<sup>50</sup> And he shall reckon with him that bought him, from the year wherein he sold himself unto him, until the year of release; and the money of his sale shall be as [that of] a hired servant: year by year shall it be with him.
<br/>
<sup>51</sup> If there be yet many years [remaining], then according to these shall he pay his redemption price from the money of his purchase.
<br/>
<sup>52</sup> But if there remain but few years unto the year of release, then shall he reckon with him according to his years, and shall pay the price of his redemption as a hired labourer.
<br/>
<sup>53</sup> Year by year shall it be with him: thou shalt not afflict him with toil before thee.
<br/>
<sup>54</sup> And if he be not redeemed by these means, then shall he go out in the year of release, he and his children with him.
<br/>
<sup>55</sup> For unto Me are the children of Israel bondmen; they are My servants, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.

<sup>1</sup> Ye shall not make for yourselves graven images, nor a carved image, nor shall ye set up for yourselves a pillar, nor shall ye place a marked stone for worship in your land; for I am the LORD your God.
<br/>
<sup>2</sup> Ye shall keep My Sabbaths, and ye shall fear My holy things: I am the LORD.
<br/>
<sup>3</sup> If ye walk in My statutes, and keep My commandments, and do them;
<br/>
<sup>4</sup> then will I give you the rain in its season, and the land shall yield her produce, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.
<br/>
<sup>5</sup> And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing; and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and ye shall dwell safely in your land (and war shall not pass through your land).
<br/>
<sup>6</sup> And I will grant peace in your land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will destroy evil beasts out of your land; and war
<br/>
<sup>7</sup> shall not pass through your land: and ye shall pursue your enemies, and they shall fall before you by slaughter.
<br/>
<sup>8</sup> And five of you shall pursue a hundred, and a hundred of you shall pursue ten thousands; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.
<br/>
<sup>9</sup> And I will look upon you,
