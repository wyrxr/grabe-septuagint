σοδον τῆς πόλεως· καὶ ἐπάταξαν τὴν πόλιν ἐν στόματι ῥομφαίας·
τὸν δὲ ἄνδρα καὶ τὴν συγγένειαν αὐτοῦ ἐξαπέστειλαν. Καὶ 26
ἀπῆλθεν ὁ ἀνὴρ εἰς γῆν Χεττιείμ· καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν ἐκεῖ πόλιν, καὶ
ἐκάλεσε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτῆς, Λουζά· τοῦτο ὄνομα αὐτῆς ἕως τῆς ἡ-
μέρας ταύτης. Καὶ οὐκ ἐκληρονόμησε Μανασσῆς τὴν Βαιθσάν, (ἡ 27
ἐστι Σκυθῶν πόλις,) οὐδὲ τὰς θυγατέρας αὐτῆς, οὐδὲ τὰ περισπό-
δια αὐτῆς, οὐδὲ τὴν Ἐχβαναὰδ καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας αὐτῆς, οὐδὲ
τοὺς κατοικοῦντας Δὼρ καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας αὐτῆς, καὶ τοὺς κατοι-
κοῦντας Βαλαὰμ καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας αὐτῆς, καὶ τοὺς κατοικοῦν-
τας Μαγεδὼν καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας αὐτῆς, οὐδὲ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας Ἰε-
βλαὰμ οὐδὲ τὰς θυγατέρας αὐτῆς· καὶ ἤρξατο ὁ Χαναναῖος κατοικ-
εῖν ἐν τῇ γῇ ταύτῃ. Καὶ ἐγένετο ὅτε ἐνίσχυσεν Ἰσραήλ, καὶ 28
ἔθετο τὸν Χαναναῖον εἰς φόρον καὶ ἐξαίρων οὐκ ἐξῆρεν αὐτόν. Καὶ 29
Ἐφραὶμ οὐκ ἐξῆρε τὸν Χαναναῖον τὸν κατοικοῦντα ἐν Γαζὲρ· καὶ
κατῴκει ὁ Χαναναῖος ἐν μέσω αὐτοῦ ἐν Γαζὲρ, καὶ ἐγένετο εἰς
φόρον. Καὶ Ζαβουλὼν οὐκ ἐξῆρε τοὺς κατοικοῦντας Κετρὼν, καὶ 30
τοὺς κατοικοῦντας Ἐναμμάν· καὶ κατῴκησεν ὁ Χαναναῖος ἐν μέ-
σῳ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐγένετο εἰς φόρον. Καὶ Ἀσὴρ οὐκ ἐξῆρε τοὺς κα- 31
τοικοῦντας Ἀγχὼ, (καὶ ἐγένετο αὐτῷ εἰς φόρον) καὶ τοὺς κα-
τοικοῦντας Δὼρ, καὶ τοὺς κατοικοῦντας Σιδῶνα, καὶ τοὺς κατοι-
κοῦντας Ἀαλὰφ, καὶ τὸν Ἀχαζείβ, καὶ τὴν Χελβὰ, καὶ τὴν Ἀ-
φὲκ, καὶ τὴν Ῥοώβ. Καὶ κατῴκησεν Ἀσὴρ ἐν μέσω τοῦ Χανα- 32
ναίου τοῦ κατοικοῦντος τὴν γῆν, ὅτι οὐκ ἐδυνάσθη ἐξᾶραι αὐτόν.
Καὶ Νεφθαλὶμ οὐκ ἐξῆρε τοὺς κατοικοῦντας Βεθσαμύς, οὐδὲ τοὺς 33
κατοικοῦντας Βαιθενὲθ, καὶ κατῴκησεν Ἰσραὴλ ἐν μέσω τοῦ Χα-
ναναίου τοῦ κατοικοῦντος τὴν γῆν· οἱ δὲ κατοικοῦντες Βεθσαμὺς
καὶ τὴν Βαιθενὲθ, ἐγενήθησαν αὐτοῖς εἰς φόρον. Καὶ ἐξέθλιψεν ὁ 34
Ἀμοῤῥαῖος τοὺς υἱοὺς Δὰν εἰς τὸ ὄρος, ὅτι οὐκ ἀφῆκεν αὐτὸν
καταβῆναι εἰς τὴν κοιλάδα. Καὶ ἤρξατο ὁ Ἀμοῤῥαῖος κατοικεῖν ἐν 35
τῷ ὄρει τοῦ Μυρσινῶνος, οὗ αἱ ἄρκοι καὶ αἱ ἀλώπεκες· καὶ ἐβά-
δυνεν χεὶρ οἴκου Ἰωσὴφ ἐπὶ τὸν Ἀμοῤῥαῖον, καὶ ἐγένετο εἰς φό- 36
ρον. Καὶ τὸ ὄριον τοῦ Ἀμοῤῥαίου ὁ Ἰδουμαῖος ἐπάνω Ἀκραβεὶν
ἀπὸ τῆς πέτρας καὶ ἐπάνω.

**JUDGES**
**CHAPTER 1.**

**25.** ...[and he shewed them] the entrance of the city:
and they smote the city with the edge of the sword;
but the man and his kindred they sent forth.
**26.** And the man went into the land of the Hittites,
and built there a city,
and called the name thereof Luz;
which is the name thereof unto this day.
**27.** And Manasseh did not drive out
the inhabitants of Beth-shean, (which is the city of the Scythians,)
nor her towns, nor her surrounding fields;
nor Achbanad and her towns;
nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns;
nor the inhabitants of Balaam and her towns;
nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns;
nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns:
but the Canaanites began to dwell in that land.
**28.** And it came to pass, when Israel was strong,
that they put the Canaanites to tribute,
but did not utterly expel them.
**29.** Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites
that dwelt in Gezer;
but the Canaanites dwelt among them in Gezer,
and became tributaries.
**30.** Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron,
nor the inhabitants of Enamman;
but the Canaanites dwelt among them,
and became tributaries.
**31.** Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Ancho
(and it became for him a tribute),
nor the inhabitants of Dor,
nor the inhabitants of Sidon,
nor the inhabitants of Ahlab,
nor Achzib,
nor Helbah,
nor Aphik,
nor Rehob.
**32.** But Asher dwelt among the Canaanites,
the inhabitants of the land,
for he was not able to drive them out.
**33.** Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh,
nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath;
but Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land:
and the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath
became unto them tributaries.
**34.** And the Amorites pressed the children of Dan into the mountain [country],
for they suffered them not to come down into the valley.
**35.** And the Amorites began to dwell in the Mount Myrtlenos,
where were the bears and the foxes;
and the hand of the house of Joseph was slow upon the Amorites,
yet they became tributaries.
**36.** And the border of the Amorite, [even] the Edomite,
[stretched] above Akrabbim,
from the rock and upward.
