1 ΚΑΙ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν, λέγων· 2 οὗτος ὁ νόμος
τοῦ λεπροῦ, ᾗ ἂν ἡμέρᾳ καθαρισθῇ· καὶ προσαχθήσεται πρὸς 3
τὸν ἱερέα, καὶ ἐξελεύσεται ὁ ἱερεὺς ἔξω τῆς παρεμβολῆς, καὶ ἐψέται
ὁ ἱερεύς, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἰᾶται ἡ ἀφὴ τῆς λέπρας ἀπὸ τοῦ λεπροῦ· καὶ
προστάξει ὁ ἱερεύς, καὶ λήψονται τῷ κεκαθαρισμένῳ 4 δύο ὀρνίθια
ζῶντα καθαρά, καὶ ξύλον κέδρινον, καὶ κεκλωσμένον κόκκινον, καὶ
ὕσσωπον· καὶ προστάζει ὁ ἱερεύς, καὶ σφάζουσι τὸ 5 ὀρνίθιον τὸ
ἓν εἰς ἀγγεῖον ὀστράκινον ἐφ’ ὕδατι ζῶντι· καὶ τὸ ὀρνίθιον 6 τὸ
ζῶν λήψεται αὐτό, καὶ τὸ ξύλον τὸ κέδρινον, καὶ τὸ κεκλωσμένον
κόκκινον, καὶ τὸν ὕσσωπον, καὶ βάψει αὐτὰ καὶ τὸ ὀρνίθιον τὸ
ζῶν εἰς τὸ αἷμα τοῦ ὀρνιθίου τοῦ σφαγέντος ἐφ’ ὕδατι ζῶντι· καὶ
περιῤῥανεῖ ἐπὶ τὸν καθαρισθέντα ἀπὸ τῆς λέπρας ἑπτάκις, 7 καὶ
καθαρὸς ἔσται· καὶ ἐξαποστελεῖ τὸ ὀρνίθιον τὸ ζῶν εἰς τὸ πεδίον.
Καὶ πλυνεῖ ὁ καθαρισθεὶς τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ. καὶ ξυρηθήσεται 8
αὐτοῦ πᾶσαν τὴν τρίχα, καὶ λούσεται ἐν ὕδατι, καὶ καθαρὸς ἔσται·
καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα εἰσελεύσεται εἰς τὴν παρεμβολήν, καὶ διατρίψει ἔξω
τοῦ οἴκου αὐτοῦ ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας. Καὶ ἔσται τῇ 9 ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ,
ξυρηθήσεται πᾶσαν τὴν τρίχα αὐτοῦ, τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὸν
πώγωνα, καὶ τὰς ὀφρύας, καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν τρίχα αὐτοῦ ξυρηθήσεται·
καὶ πλυνεῖ τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ, καὶ λούσεται τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ ὕδατι,
καὶ καθαρὸς ἔσται. Καὶ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ 10 τῇ ὀγδόῃ λήψεται δύο ἀμνοὺς
ἐνιαυσίους ἀμώμους, καὶ πρόβατον ἓν ἐνιαύσιον ἄμωμον, καὶ τρία
δέκατα σεμιδάλεως εἰς θυσίαν πεφυραμένης ἐν ἐλαίῳ, καὶ κοτύλην
ἐλαίου μίαν· καὶ στήσει ὁ ἱερεὺς 11 καθαρίζων τὸν ἄνθρωπον τὸν
καθαριζόμενον καὶ ταῦτα ἔναντι Κυρίου, ἐπὶ τὴν θύραν τῆς σκηνῆς
τοῦ μαρτυρίου. Καὶ λήψεται ὁ 12 ἱερεὺς τὸν ἀμνὸν τὸν ἕνα, καὶ
προσάξει αὐτὸν τῆς πλημμελείας, καὶ τὴν κοτύλην τοῦ ἐλαίου, καὶ
ἀφοριεῖ αὐτὰ ἀφόρισμα ἔναντι Κυρίου. Καὶ σφάζουσι τὸν ἀμνὸν
ἐν τόπῳ, ᾧ σφάζουσι τὰ ὁλοκαυτώματα, 13 καὶ τὰ περὶ ἁμαρτίας,
ἐν τόπῳ ἁγίῳ· ἔστι γὰρ τὸ περὶ ἁμαρτίας, ὥσπερ τὸ τῆς πλημμελείας
ἐστί· τῷ ἱερεῖ· ἅγια ἁγίων ἐστί. Καὶ λήψεται ὁ ἱερεὺς ἀπὸ τοῦ
αἵματος τοῦ τῆς πλημμελείας, 14 καὶ ἐπιθήσει ὁ ἱερεὺς ἐπὶ τὸν
λοβὸν τοῦ ὠτὸς τοῦ καθαρι-

## LEVITICUS
### CHAPTER XIV.

1.  And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying:
2.  "This is the law of the leper, on whatsoever day he shall be cleansed.
3.  And he shall be brought unto the priest; and the priest shall go forth outside the camp, and the priest shall examine [him]; and behold, the plague of leprosy is healed from the leper.
4.  And the priest shall command, and they shall take for him that is to be cleansed two clean living birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet thread, and hyssop.
5.  And the priest commandeth, and they shall slay the one bird into an earthenware vessel over living water.
6.  And the living bird shall he take, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet thread, and the hyssop; and he shall dip them, and the living bird, into the blood of the bird that was slain over living water.
7.  And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and he shall be clean; and he shall release the living bird into the open field.
8.  And he that is cleansed shall wash his garments; and all his hair shall be shaved from him, and he shall bathe himself in water, and he shall be clean. And after these things, he shall come into the camp, and he shall tarry outside his house seven days.
9.  And it shall be on the seventh day, that all his hair shall be shaved from him: his head, and his beard, and his eyebrows, and all his hair shall be shaved from him. And he shall wash his garments, and he shall bathe his body in water, and he shall be clean.
10. And on the eighth day, he shall take two yearling lambs without blemish, and one yearling ewe-lamb without blemish, and three tenth parts of fine flour for a sacrifice, mingled with oil, and one log of oil.
11. And the priest that maketh clean the man that is to be cleansed shall set him, and these things, before the Lord, at the door of the tabernacle of testimony.
12. And the priest shall take the one lamb, and shall bring it for a trespass offering, and the log of oil; and he shall wave them as a wave offering before the Lord.
13. And they shall slay the lamb in the place where they slay the burnt offerings, and the [sacrifices] for sin, in a holy place. For the [sacrifice] for sin is as the trespass offering; it is the priest's; it is most holy.
14. And the priest shall take of the blood of the trespass offering, and the priest shall put it upon the lobe of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed,
