**10.** ἀγωγὴ δώδεκα χιλιάδας ἀνδρῶν ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν τῆς δυνάμεως, καὶ
ἐνετείλαντο αὐτοῖς, λέγοντες· πορεύθητε καὶ πατάξατε πάντας τοὺς
κατοικοῦντας Ἰαβεὶς Γαλαάδ ἐν στόματι ῥομφαίας, καὶ τὰς γυ-
ναῖκας καὶ τὸν λαόν. Καὶ οὗτος ὁ λόγος ὃν ποιήσετε· πᾶν ἄρσε-

εῖτε. Καὶ εὗρον ἀπὸ τῶν κατοικούντων Ἰαβεὶς Γαλαάδ τετρακο-
**12.** σίας νεάνιδας παρθένους, αἳ οὐκ ἔγνωσαν ἄνδρα εἰς κοίτην ἄρσε-
νος· καὶ ἦγον αὐτὰς εἰς τὴν παρεμβολὴν εἰς Σηλὼμ ἣ ἔστιν ἐν
γῇ Χαναάν. Καὶ ἀπέστειλαν πᾶσα ἡ συναγωγὴ καὶ ἐλάλησαν
**13.** πρὸς τοὺς υἱοὺς Βενιαμεὶν τοὺς ἐν τῇ πέτρᾳ Ῥεμμών, καὶ ἐκάλε-
σαν αὐτοὺς εἰς εἰρήνην. Καὶ ἀπέστρεψε Βενιαμεὶν πρὸς τοὺς υἱ-
**14.** οὺς Ἰσραὴλ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ, καὶ ἔδωκαν αὐτοῖς τὰς γυναῖ-
κας, αἵτινες ἦσαν ἐκ τῶν γυναικῶν Ἰαβεὶς Γαλαάδ· καὶ ἤρεσεν
αὐτοῖς οὕτως. Καὶ ὁ λαὸς παρεκλήθη τῷ Βενιαμείν, ὅτι ἐποί-
**15.** ησε Κύριος διακοπὴν ἐν ταῖς φυλαῖς Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ εἶπαν οἱ πρε-
**16.** σβύτεροι τῆς συναγωγῆς· τί ποιήσωμεν τοῖς ἐπιλοίποις εἰς γυναῖ-
κας? ὅτι ἠφάνισται ἐκ τοῦ Βενιαμεὶν γυνή. Καὶ εἶπαν· κληρονο-
**17.** μία διασεσωσμένη τῷ Βενιαμείν, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἐξαλειφθῇ φυλὴ ἐξ Ἰσ-
ραήλ. Καὶ ἡμεῖς οὐ δυνησόμεθα δοῦναι αὐτοῖς γυναῖκας ἀπὸ τῶν
**18.** θυγατέρων ἡμῶν, ὅτι ὠμόσαμεν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ λέγοντες· ἐπίκα-
τάρατος ὁ διδούς γυναῖκα τῷ Βενιαμείν. Καὶ εἶπαν· Ἰδοὺ ἑορτὴ
**19.** τῷ Κυρίῳ ἐν Σηλὼ ἀφ᾿ ἡμερῶν εἰς ἡμέρας, ἣ ἐστιν ἀπὸ βοῤῥᾶ
τῆς Βαιθήλ, κατ᾿ ἀνατολὰς ἡλίου ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ τῇ ἀναβαινούσῃ ἐκ Βαι-
θὴλ εἰς Σικίμα, καὶ ἀπὸ νότου τοῦ Λιβάνου τῆς Λεβωνᾶ. Καὶ
**20.** ἐνετείλαντο τοῖς υἱοῖς Βενιαμείν, λέγοντες· διέλθατε καὶ ἐνεδρεύσα-
**21.** τε ἐν τοῖς ἀμπελῶσι, καὶ ὄψεσθε, καὶ ἰδοὺ ὡς ἂν ἐξέλθωσιν αἱ
θυγατέρες τῶν κατοικούντων Σηλώ, χορεῦσαι ἐν χοροῖς, καὶ ἐξε-
λεύσεσθε ἀπὸ τῶν ἀμπελώνων, καὶ ἁρπάσετε ἀνὴρ ἑαυτοῖς γυναῖκας
ἀπὸ τῶν θυγατέρων Σηλώ, καὶ ἀπελεύσεσθε εἰς γῆν Βενιαμείν.
**22.** Καὶ ἔσται ὅταν ἔλθωσιν οἱ πατέρες αὐτῶν ἢ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτῶν
κρίνεσθαι πρὸς ἡμᾶς, καὶ ἐροῦμεν πρὸς αὐτούς· ἐλεήσατε αὐτούς,
ὅτι οὐκ ἐλάβομεν ἀνὴρ γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ· οὐ γὰρ
ὑμεῖς ἐδώκατε αὐτοῖς κατὰ τὸν καιρόν, πλημμελήσατε. Καὶ ἐποίη-
**23.** σαν οὕτως οἱ υἱοὶ Βενιαμείν, καὶ ἔλαβον γυναῖκας κατὰ τὸν ἀριθ-
μὸν αὐτῶν ἀπὸ τῶν χορευουσῶν, ἃς διήρπασαν· καὶ ἀπῆλθον καὶ
ἀπέστρεψαν ἐπὶ τὴν κληρονομίαν αὐτῶν, καὶ ᾠκοδόμησαν ἑαυτοῖς

### Judges Chapter 21

**10.** [gregation sent] twelve thousand men from among the valiant, and commanded them, saying, "Go ye and smite all those who dwell in Jabes Galaad with the edge of the sword, both the women and the people.
**11.** And this is the word which ye shall do: every male, and every woman that knoweth the bed of a male, ye shall utterly destroy."
**12.** And they found from among the inhabitants of Jabes Galaad four hundred young virgins, who had not known a man for the bed of a male; and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.
**13.** And all the congregation sent, and spake to the children of Benjamin who were on the rock Remmon, and called them unto peace.
**14.** And Benjamin returned unto the children of Israel at that time, and they gave them the wives, which were from among the women of Jabes Galaad; and this pleased them well.
**15.** And the people were grieved for Benjamin, because the Lord had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.

**17.** And they said, "A heritage is preserved for Benjamin, and a tribe shall not be blotted out from Israel.

**20.** And they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, "Go ye and lie in wait in the vineyards;
**21.** And ye shall see, and behold, when the daughters of them that dwell in Shiloh come forth to dance in dances, then shall ye come out from the vineyards, and every man shall snatch for himself a wife from among the daughters of Shiloh, and ye shall go unto the land of Benjamin.
**22.** And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come to contend with us, that we will say unto them, 'Have pity upon them; for we took not every man his wife in the war. For ye yourselves gave them not to them at the [appointed] time, [lest ye should] transgress.'"
**23.** And the children of Benjamin did so, and took wives according to their number from among them that danced, whom they carried off by force; and they departed and returned unto their inheritance, and built for themselves cities,
