**ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ**

**ΚΕΦ. ΙΑ΄. ΙΒ΄.**

26 καὶ ἐγέννησεν υἱοὺς καὶ θυγατέρας, καὶ ἀπέθανε. Καὶ ἔζησε Θάρα ἑβδομήκοντα ἔτη, καὶ ἐγέννησε τὸν Ἄβραμ, καὶ τὸν Ναχώρ,
27 καὶ τὸν Ἀῤῥάν. Αὗται δὲ αἱ γενέσεις Θάρα· Θάρα δὲ ἐγέννησε τὸν Ἄβραμ, καὶ τὸν Ναχώρ, καὶ τὸν Ἀῤῥάν· καὶ Ἀῤῥὰν ἐγέννησε
28 τὸν Λώτ. Καὶ ἀπέθανεν Ἀῤῥὰν ἐνώπιον Θάρα τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ γῇ ᾗ ἐγεννήθη, ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ τῶν Χαλδαίων.
29 Καὶ ἔλαβεν Ἄβραμ καὶ Ναχὼρ ἑαυτοῖς γυναῖκας· ὄνομα τῇ γυναικὶ Ἄβραμ, Σάρα· καὶ ὄνομα τῇ γυναικὶ Ναχώρ, Μελχά, θυγάτηρ
30 Ἀῤῥάν, καὶ πατὴρ Μελχά, καὶ πατὴρ Ἰεσχά. Καὶ ἦν Σάρα στείρα, καὶ οὐκ ἐτεκνοποίει.
31 Καὶ ἔλαβε Θάρα τὸν Ἄβραμ τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὸν Λὼτ υἱὸν Ἀῤῥάν, υἱὸν τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὴν Σάραν τὴν νύμφην αὐτοῦ, γυναῖκα Ἄβραμ τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐξήγαγεν αὐτοὺς ἐκ τῆς χώρας τῶν Χαλδαίων, πορευθῆναι εἰς τὴν γῆν Χαναάν· καὶ ἦλθον ἕως Χαῤῥάν, καὶ κατώκησαν ἐκεῖ.
32 Καὶ ἐγένοντο αἱ ἡμέραι Θάρα ἐν Χαῤῥάν, διακόσια πέντε ἔτη, καὶ ἀπέθανε Θάρα ἐν Χαῤῥάν.

**ΚΕΦ. ΙΒ΄. ΧΙΙ.**

1 ΚΑὶ εἶπε Κύριος τῷ Ἄβραμ· ἔξελθε ἐκ τῆς γῆς σου, καὶ ἐκ τῆς συγγενείας σου, καὶ ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ πατρός σου εἰς τὴν
2 γῆν, ἣν ἄν σοι δείξω· καὶ ποιήσω σε εἰς ἔθνος μέγα, καὶ εὐλογήσω σε, καὶ μεγαλυνῶ τὸ ὄνομά σου, καὶ ἔσῃ εὐλογητός·
3 καὶ εὐλογήσω τοὺς εὐλογοῦντάς σε, καὶ τοὺς καταρωμένους σε καταράσομαι· καὶ εὐλογηθήσονται ἐν σοὶ πᾶσαι αἱ φυλαὶ τῆς γῆς.
4 Καὶ ἐπορεύθη Ἄβραμ, καθάπερ ἐλάλησεν αὐτῷ Κύριος, καὶ ᾤχετο μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ Λώτ· Ἄβραμ δὲ ἦν ἐτῶν ἑβδομηκονταπέντε, ὅτε
5 ἐξῆλθεν ἐκ Χαῤῥάν. Καὶ ἔλαβεν Ἄβραμ τὴν Σάραν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὸν Λὼτ υἱὸν τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντα τὰ ὑπάρχοντα αὐτῶν ὅσα ἐκτήσαντο, καὶ πᾶσαν ψυχὴν ἣν ἐκτήσαντο ἐκ Χαῤῥάν, καὶ ἐξῆλθοσαν πορευθῆναι εἰς γῆν Χαναάν· καὶ ἦλθον εἰς γῆν Χαναάν.
6 Καὶ διώδευσεν Ἄβραμ εἰς τὸ μῆκος αὐτῆς ἕως τοῦ τόπου Συχέμ, ἐπὶ τὴν δρῦν τὴν ὑψηλήν· οἱ δὲ Χαναναῖοι τότε κατώκουν τὴν γῆν.
7 Καὶ ὤφθη Κύριος τῷ Ἄβραμ, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· τῷ σπέρματί σου δώσω τὴν γῆν ταύτην· καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν ἐκεῖ Ἄβραμ θυσιαστήριον Κυρίῳ τῷ ὀφθέντι αὐτῷ.

**GENESIS**

**CHAPTER 11**

26 and he begat sons and daughters, and he died. And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, and Nahor,
27 and Haran. Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, and Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat
28 Lot. And Haran died before Terah his father in the land where he was born, in the country of the Chaldeans.
29 And Abram and Nahor took wives unto themselves: the name of Abram’s wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor’s wife, Milcah, the daughter of
30 Haran, and the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah. And Sarai was barren, and she bore no children.
31 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, the wife of Abram his son; and he brought them forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.
32 And the days of Terah in Haran were two hundred and five years; and Terah died in Haran.

**CHAPTER 12**

1 Now the Lord said unto Abram:
“Depart from thy land, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house,
2 unto the land that I shall show thee.
And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee,
and make thy name great; and thou shalt be blessed.
3 And I will bless them that bless thee,
and him that curseth thee will I curse:
and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed.”

4 So Abram went, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him. And Abram was seventy-five years old, when
5 he departed from Haran. And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all their possessions which they had acquired, and all the souls they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and they came into the land of Canaan.
6 And Abram passed through the land, even to the place of Shechem, unto the lofty oak; and the Canaanites were then dwelling in the land.
7 And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said unto him:
“Unto thy seed will I give this land.”
And there Abram built an altar unto the Lord, who had appeared unto him.
8 And he removed from thence unto the
