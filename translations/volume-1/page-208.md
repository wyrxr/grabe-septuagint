περιστερῶν, μίαν εἰς ὁλοκαύτωμα, καὶ μίαν περὶ ἁμαρτίας· καὶ
ἐξιλάσεται περὶ αὐτῆς ὁ ἱερεύς, καὶ καθαρισθήσεται.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΓ´. ΧΙΙΙ.

1.  ΚΑὶ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωϋσῆν καὶ Ἀαρών, λέγων·
2.  Ἀνθρώπῳ τινὶ ἐὰν γένηται ἐν δέρματι χρωτὸς αὐτοῦ συλὴ ἢ σημασία ἢ τηλαυγής, καὶ γένηται ἐν δέρματι χρωτὸς αὐτοῦ ἀφὴ λέπρας, καὶ ἀχθήσεται πρὸς Ἀαρὼν τὸν ἱερέα, ἢ ἕνα τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ τῶν ἱερέων.
3.  Καὶ ὄψεται ὁ ἱερεὺς τὴν ἀφὴν ἐν δέρματι τοῦ χρωτὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἡ θρὶξ μεταβάλῃ ἐν τῇ ἀφῇ λευκή, καὶ ἡ ὄψις τῆς ἀφῆς ταπεινὴ ἀπὸ τοῦ δέρματος τοῦ χρωτὸς αὐτοῦ, ἀφὴ λέπρας ἐστί· καὶ ὄψεται αὐτὸν ὁ ἱερεύς, καὶ μιανεῖ αὐτόν.
4.  Ἐὰν δὲ τηλαυγὴς λευκὴ ἢ ἐν τῷ δέρματι τοῦ χρωτὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ταπεινὴ μὴ ᾖ ἡ ὄψις αὐτῆς ἀπὸ τοῦ δέρματος, καὶ ἡ θρὶξ αὐτοῦ οὐ μετέβαλε τρίχα λευκήν, αὕτη δέ ἐστιν ἀμαυρά, καὶ ἀφοριεῖ ὁ ἱερεύς τὴν ἀφὴν ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας·
5.  καὶ ὄψεται ὁ ἱερεὺς τὴν ἀφὴν ἡμέρα τῇ ἑβδόμῃ, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἡ ἀφὴ μένει ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ, οὐ μετέπεσεν ἡ ἀφὴ ἐν τῷ δέρματι, καὶ ἀφοριεῖ αὐτὸν ὁ ἱερεὺς ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας τοδεύτερον·
6.  καὶ ὄψεται αὐτὸν ὁ ἱερεὺς τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ τοδεύτερον, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἀμαυρὰ ἡ ἀφὴ, οὐ μετέπεσεν ἡ ἀφὴ ἐν τῷ δέρματι, καὶ καθαριεῖ αὐτὸν ὁ ἱερεύς· σημασία γάρ ἐστι· καὶ πλυνάμενος τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ, καθαρὸς ἔσται.
7.  Ἐὰν δὲ μεταβαλοῦσα μεταπέσῃ ἡ σημασία ἐν τῷ δέρματι, μετὰ τὸ ἰδεῖν αὐτὸν τὸν ἱερέα τοῦ καθαρίσαι αὐτὸν,
8.  καὶ ὀφθήσεται τοδεύτερον τῷ ἱερεῖ· καὶ ὄψεται (αὐτὸν) ὁ ἱερεύς, καὶ ἰδοὺ μετέπεσεν ἡ σημασία ἐν τῷ δέρματι, καὶ μιανεῖ αὐτὸν ὁ ἱερεύς· λέπρα ἐστί.
9.  Καὶ ἀφὴ λέπρας ἐὰν γένηται ἐν τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ, καὶ ἥξει πρὸς τὸν ἱερέα·
10. καὶ ὄψεται ὁ ἱερεύς, καὶ ἰδοὺ οὐλὴ λευκὴ ἐν τῷ δέρματι, καὶ αὕτη μετέβαλε τρίχα λευκήν, καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ ὑγιοῦς τῆς σαρκὸς τῆς ζώσης ἐν τῇ οὐλῇ,
11. λέπρα παλαιουμένη ἐστὶν ἐν τῷ δέρματι τοῦ χρωτὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ μιανεῖ αὐτὸν ὁ ἱερεύς, καὶ οὐκ ἀφοριεῖ αὐτὸν, ὅτι ἀκάθαρτός ἐστιν.
12. Ἐὰν δὲ ἐξανθοῦσα ἐξανθήσῃ ἡ λέπρα ἐν τῷ δέρματι, καὶ καλύψῃ ἡ λέπρα πᾶν τὸ δέρμα τῆς ἀφῆς ἀπὸ κεφαλῆς ἕως ποδῶν αὐτοῦ καθ᾽ ὅλην τὴν ὅρασιν τοῦ ἱερέως,
13. καὶ ὄψεται ὁ ἱερεὺς, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐκάλυψεν ἡ λέπρα πᾶν τὸ δέρμα τοῦ χρωτὸς αὐ-

### English Translation

### Leviticus 13

1.  And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying,
2.  When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a swelling, or a scab, or a bright spot; and it becometh in the skin of his flesh a plague of leprosy, then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons, the priests.
3.  And the priest shall look upon the plague in the skin of his flesh: and if the hair in the plague be turned white, and the appearance of the plague be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague of leprosy; and the priest shall look upon him and pronounce him unclean.
4.  But if there be a white bright spot in the skin of his flesh, and the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white, then this is dim; and the priest shall shut up the plague for seven days.
5.  And the priest shall look on the plague on the seventh day; and, behold, if the plague remain in his sight, and the plague hath not spread in the skin, then the priest shall shut him up a second time for seven days.
6.  And the priest shall look upon him on the seventh day a second time; and, behold, if the plague be dim, and the plague hath not spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean; for it is but a scab. And he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.
7.  But if the scab, having changed, doth greatly spread abroad in the skin, after the priest hath seen him and pronounced him clean,
8.  then he shall be shown a second time unto the priest. And the priest shall look [upon him], and, behold, if the scab hath spread abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is leprosy.
9.  When a plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest.
10. And the priest shall look, and, behold, if there be a white swelling in the skin, and it hath turned the hair white, and there be quick raw flesh in the swelling,
11. it is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh; and the priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up, for he is unclean.
12. And if the leprosy, breaking out, doth break forth abroad in the skin, and the leprosy doth cover all the skin of the plague from his head even unto his feet, as far as the priest can discern,
13. then the priest shall look; and, behold, if the leprosy hath covered all the skin of his flesh,
