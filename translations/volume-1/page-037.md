22 ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ ΚΕΦ. ΙΔʹ. ΙΕʹ.
17 πάροχοντα αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰς γυναῖκας, καὶ τὸν λαόν. Ἐξῆλθε δὲ
    βασιλεὺς Σοδόμων εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτῷ, μετὰ τὸ ὑποστρέψαι αὐ-
    τὸν ἀπὸ τῆς κοπῆς τοῦ Χοδολλογομὸρ καὶ τῶν βασιλέων τῶν
    μετ’ αὐτοῦ, εἰς τὴν κοιλάδα τὴν Σαυήν· τοῦτο ἦν τὸ πεδίον βα-
18 σιλέως. Καὶ Μελχισεδὲκ βασιλεὺς Σαλὴμ ἐξήνεγκεν ἄρτους καὶ
19 οἶνον· ἦν δὲ ἱερεὺς τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ ὑψίστου. Καὶ ηὐλόγησε τὸν Ἄ-
    βραμ, καὶ εἶπεν· εὐλογημένος Ἄβραμ τῷ Θεῷ τῷ ὑψίστῳ, ὃς
20 ἔκτισε τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ τὴν γῆν. Καὶ εὐλογητὸς ὁ Θεὸς ὁ ὕψι-
    στος, ὃς παρέδωκε τοὺς ἐχθρούς σου ὑποχειρίους σοι· καὶ ἔδωκεν
21 αὐτῷ δεκάτην ἀπὸ πάντων. Εἶπε δὲ βασιλεὺς Σοδόμων πρὸς Ἄ-
22 βραμ· δὸς μοι τοὺς ἄνδρας, τὴν δὲ ἵππον λάβε σεαυτῷ. Εἶπε
    δὲ Ἄβραμ πρὸς βασιλέα Σοδόμων· ἐκτενῶ τὴν χεῖρά μου πρὸς
    Κύριον τὸν Θεὸν τὸν ὕψιστον, ὃς ἔκτισε τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ τὴν γῆν,
23 εἰ ἀπὸ σπαρτίου ἕως σφαιρωτῆρος ὑποδήματος λήψομαι ἀπὸ πάν-
    των τῶν σῶν (ἵνα μὴ εἴπῃς, ὅτι ἐγὼ ἐπλούτισα τὸν Ἄβραμ·)
24 πλὴν ὧν ἔφαγον οἱ νεανίσκοι, καὶ τῆς μερίδος τῶν ἀνδρῶν τῶν
    συμπορευθέντων μετ’ ἐμοῦ, Ἐσχὼλ, Αὐνὰν, Μαμβρῆ· οὗτοι λή-
    ψονται μερίδα.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΕʹ. XV.

1 ΜΕΤΑ δὲ τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα ἐγενήθη ῥῆμα Κυρίου πρὸς Ἄ-
    βραμ ἐν ὁράματι, λέγων· μὴ φοβοῦ Ἄβραμ· ἐγὼ ὑπερασπίζω σου·
2 ὁ μισθός σου πολὺς ἔσται σφόδρα. Λέγει δὲ Ἄβραμ· δέσποτα Κύ-
    ριε, τί μοι δώσεις; ἐγὼ δὲ ἀπολύσομαι ἄτεκνος· ὁ δὲ υἱὸς **Μασὲκ**
    τῆς οἰκογενοῦς μου, οὗτος Δαμασκὸς Ἐλιέζερ.
3 Καὶ εἶπεν· Ἄβραμ· ἐπειδὴ ἐμοὶ οὐκ ἔδωκας σπέρμα, ὁ δὲ οἰκογενής μου
    κληρονομήσει με.
4 Καὶ εὐθὺς φωνὴ Κυρίου ἐγένετο πρὸς αὐτὸν,
    λέγων· οὐ κληρονομήσει σε οὗτος, ἀλλ’ ὃς ἐξελεύσεται ἐκ σοῦ,
5 οὗτος κληρονομήσει σε. Ἐξήγαγε δὲ αὐτὸν ἔξω, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς
    αὐτόν· ἀνάβλεψον δὴ εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν, καὶ ἀρίθμησον τοὺς ἀστέ-
    ρας, εἰ δύνη ἐξαριθμῆσαι αὐτούς. Καὶ εἶπεν· οὕτως ἔσται τὸ
6 σπέρμα σου. Καὶ ἐπίστευσεν Ἄβραμ τῷ Θεῷ, καὶ ἐλογίσθη αὐ-
7 τῷ εἰς δικαιοσύνην. Εἶπε δὲ αὐτῷ· ἐγὼ ὁ Θεὸς ὁ ἐξαγαγὼν σε
    ἐκ χώρας Χαλδαίων, ὥστε δοῦναί σοι τὴν γῆν ταύτην κληρονο-
8 μῆσαι. Εἶπε δέ· δέσποτα Κύριε, κατὰ τί γνώσομαι ὅτι κληρονο-
9 μήσω αὐτήν; Εἶπε δὲ αὐτῷ· λάβε μοι δάμαλιν τριετίζουσαν· καὶ

17 his provisions, and the women, and the people. And the king of Sodom
    went out to meet him, after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer
    and of the kings that were with him, unto the valley of Shaveh,
    which is the king's plain.
18 And Melchizedek, king of Salem, brought forth bread and wine;
    and he was a priest of God Most High.
19 And he blessed Abram, and said, Blessed be Abram by God Most High,
    Who created the heaven and the earth.
20 And blessed be God Most High, Who delivered your enemies into your hands.
    And Abram gave him a tenth of all.
21 And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the men,
    and take the horse for yourself.
22 And Abram said unto the king of Sodom, I will lift up my hand
    unto the LORD, God Most High, Who created the heaven and the earth,
23 that I will not take from a shoelace even unto a sandal-thong of anything that is yours,
    (lest you should say, "I have made Abram rich;")
24 save only that which the young men have eaten,
    and the portion of the men who journeyed with me,
    Eshkol, Aunan, and Mamre; these shall receive their portion.

**Genesis 15**

1 Now after these things, the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying,
    "Fear not, Abram: I am your shield;
2 your reward shall be exceeding great." And Abram said,
    "Lord, O LORD, what will You give me? Seeing I go childless;
    and the son of Massek, of my household, this Eliezer of Damascus."
3 And Abram said, "Since You have given no seed to me,
    a home-born slave of mine shall be my heir."
4 And immediately the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,
    "This one shall not inherit you; but he that shall come forth out of your own body,
    he shall inherit you."
5 And He led him forth abroad, and said unto him,
    "Look up now toward the heaven, and number the stars,
    if you are able to number them." And He said, "So shall your seed be."
6 And Abram believed in God, and it was accounted unto him for righteousness.
7 And He said unto him, "I am the God Who brought you out of the land of the Chaldeans,
    to give you this land to inherit."
8 And he said, "Lord, O LORD, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?"
9 And He said unto him, "Take for Me a three-year-old heifer; and"
