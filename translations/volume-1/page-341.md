ΔΕΥΤΕΡΟΝΟΜΙΟΝ ΚΕΦ. Θʹ.
νας μου εἰσήγαγέ με Κύριος, κληρονομῆσαι τὴν γῆν τὴν ἀγαθὴν
ταύτην· ἀλλὰ διὰ τὴν ἀσέβειαν τῶν ἐθνῶν τούτων, Κύριος ἐξο-
λοθρεύσει αὐτοὺς πρὸ προσώπου σου. Οὐχὶ διὰ τὴν δικαιοσύνην
σου, καὶ διὰ τὴν ὁσιότητα τῆς καρδίας σου σὺ εἰσπορεύῃ κλη-
ρονομῆσαι τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν, ἀλλὰ διὰ τὴν ἀνομίαν τῶν ἐθνῶν τού-
των Κύριος ἐξολοθρεύσει αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ προσώπου σου, καὶ ἵνα στήσῃ
τὴν διαθήκην, ἣν ὤμοσε Κύριος τοῖς πατράσιν ὑμῶν, Ἀβραὰμ
καὶ Ἰσαὰκ καὶ Ἰακώβ· καὶ γνώσῃ σήμερον, ὅτι οὐ διὰ τὰς δικαιο-
σύνας σου Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου δίδωσί σοι τὴν γῆν τὴν ἀγαθὴν
ταύτην κληρονομῆσαι, ὅτι λαὸς σκληροτράχηλός εἰ. Μνήσθητι, μὴ
ἐπιλάθῃ ὅσα παρώξυνας Κύριον τὸν Θεόν σου ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ· ἀφ’
ἧς ἡμέρας ἐξήλθετε ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, ἕως ἤλθετε εἰς τὸν τόπον
τοῦτον, ἀπειθοῦντες διετελεῖτε τὰ πρὸς Κύριον. Καὶ ἐν Χωρὴβ
παρωξύνατε Κύριον, καὶ ἐθυμώθη Κύριος ἐφ’ ὑμῖν ἐξολοθρεῦσαι
ὑμᾶς, ἀναβαίνοντός μου εἰς τὸ ὄρος, λαβεῖν τὰς πλάκας τὰς λι-
θίνας, πλάκας διαθήκης, ἃς διέθετο Κύριος πρὸς ὑμᾶς· καὶ
κατεγενόμην ἐν τῷ ὄρει τεσσαράκοντα ἡμέρας καὶ τεσσαρά-
κοντα νύκτας· ἄρτον οὐκ ἔφαγον, καὶ ὕδωρ οὐκ ἔπιον. Καὶ ἔ-
δωκέ μοι Κύριος τὰς δύο πλάκας τὰς λιθίνας τὰς γεγραμ-
μένας ἐν τῷ δακτύλῳ τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ ἐπ’ αὐταῖς ἐγέγραπτο πάν-
τες οἱ λόγοι, οὓς ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς ὑμᾶς ἐν τῷ ὄρει ἐκ μέ-
σου τοῦ πυρὸς ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ἐκκλησίας· καὶ ἐγένετο διὰ τεσσαράκον-
τα ἡμερῶν καὶ διὰ τεσσαράκοντα νυκτῶν ἔδωκέ μοι Κύριος τὰς δύο
πλάκας τὰς λιθίνας, πλάκας τῆς διαθήκης. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρός
μέ· ἀνάστηθι, (καὶ) κατάβηθι ταχύς ἐντεῦθεν, ὅτι ἠνόμησεν
ὁ λαός σου, οὓς ἐξήγαγες ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου· παρέβησαν τα-
χὺ ἐκ τῆς ὁδοῦ, ἧς ἐνετείλω αὐτοῖς· ἐποίησαν ἑαυτοῖς χώ-
νευμα. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς μέ· λελάληκα πρὸς σὲ ἅπαξ
καὶ δίς, λέγων· ἑώρακα τὸν λαὸν τοῦτον, καὶ ἰδοὺ λαὸς σκληρο-
τράχηλός ἐστιν. Ἔασόν με ἐξολοθρεῦσαι αὐτούς, καὶ ἐξαλείψω τὸ
ὄνομα αὐτῶν ὑποκάτωθεν τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ ποιήσω σε εἰς ἔθνος
(μέγα καὶ) πολὺ καὶ ἰσχυρὸν μᾶλλον ἢ τοῦτο. Καὶ ἐπιστρέψας,
κατέβην ἐκ τοῦ ὄρους, καὶ τὸ ὄρος ἐκαίετο πυρί· καὶ αἱ δύο πλά-
κες τῶν μαρτυρίων ἐπὶ ταῖς δυσὶ χερσί μου. Καὶ ἰδὼν ὅτι ἡμάρ-
τητε ἔναντι Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ὑμῶν, καὶ ἐποιήσατε ὑμῖν αὐτοῖς
μόσχον χωνευτόν, καὶ παρέβητε ταχὺ ἀπὸ τῆς ὁδοῦ ἧς ἐνετεί-

**Deuteronomy Chapter 9**

...the Lord did bring me into this goodly land, to possess it.
But for the wickedness of these nations, the Lord shall utterly destroy them before thy face.
Not by reason of thy righteousness, nor by reason of the piety of thy heart, dost thou go in to possess their land;
but by reason of the iniquity of these nations shall the Lord utterly destroy them from before thy face,
and to the end that He may establish the covenant, which the Lord swore unto your fathers,
Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob.

And thou shalt know this day, that not for thy righteousness doth the Lord thy God give thee this goodly land to inherit;
for thou art a stiff-necked people.
Remember, and forget not, all wherein thou didst provoke the Lord thy God in the wilderness.
From the day that ye departed out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place,
ye were continually rebellious toward the Lord.
And even in Horeb did ye provoke the Lord, and the Lord was wroth against you,
to utterly destroy you,
when I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone,
even the tables of the covenant, which the Lord made with you.
And I abode upon the mount forty days and forty nights;
bread I did not eat, and water I did not drink.
And the Lord gave unto me the two tables of stone, which were written with the finger of God;
and upon them were written all the words which the Lord spake unto you in the mount from out of the midst of the fire
in the day of the assembly.
And it came to pass after forty days and forty nights, that the Lord gave unto me the two tables of stone,
the tables of the covenant.

And the Lord said unto me: Arise, (and) get thee down swiftly from hence;
for thy people, whom thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt, have wrought iniquity.
They have quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them;
they have made unto themselves a molten image.
And the Lord spake unto me, saying:
I have spoken unto thee again and again, saying:
I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked people.
Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and I will blot out their name from under heaven;
and I will make of thee a nation (great and) numerous and mightier than this one.
So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain burned with fire;
and the two tables of the Testimony were in my two hands.
And when I saw that ye had sinned against the Lord your God,
and had made unto yourselves a molten calf,
and had quickly turned aside out of the way which the Lord commanded you—
