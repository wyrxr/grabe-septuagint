ΚΑΙ εἶπε Βαλαὰμ τῷ Βαλάκ· οἰκοδόμησόν μοι ἐνταῦθα ἑπτὰ 1
βωμούς, καὶ ἑτοίμασόν μοι ἐνταῦθα ἑπτὰ μόσχους, καὶ ἑπτὰ κρι-
ούς. Καὶ ἐποίησε Βαλάκ, ὃν τρόπον εἶπεν αὐτῷ Βαλαάμ· καὶ ἀν- 2
ήνεγκε Βαλάκ καὶ Βαλαὰμ μόσχον καὶ κριὸν ἐπὶ τὸν βωμόν. Καὶ 3
εἶπε Βαλαὰμ πρὸς Βαλάκ· παράστηθι ἐπὶ τῆς θυσίας σου, ἐγὼ
δὲ πορεύσομαι, εἴ μοι φανεῖται ὁ Θεὸς ἐν συναντήσει, καὶ ῥῆμα
ὃ ἐάν μοι δείξῃ, ἀναγγελῶ σοι. Καὶ παρέστη Βαλάκ ἐπὶ τῆς θυ-
σίας αὐτοῦ· καὶ Βαλαὰμ ἐπορεύθη ἐπερωτῆσαι τὸν Θεόν, καὶ ἐπο-
ρεύθη εὐθεῖαν. Καὶ ἐφάνη ὁ Θεὸς τῷ Βαλαάμ, καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐ- 4
τὸν Βαλαάμ· τοὺς ἑπτὰ βωμοὺς ἡτοίμασα, καὶ ἀνεβίβασα μόσχον
καὶ κριὸν ἐπὶ τὸν βωμόν. Καὶ ἐνέβαλεν ὁ Θεὸς ῥῆμα εἰς τὸ στό- 5
μα Βαλαάμ, καὶ εἶπεν· ἐπιστραφεὶς πρὸς Βαλάκ, οὕτω λαλήσεις.
Καὶ ἀπεστράφη πρὸς αὐτόν· καὶ ὁ δὲ ἐφειστήκει ἐπὶ τῶν ὁλοκαυ- 6
τωμάτων αὐτοῦ, καὶ πάντες οἱ ἄρχοντες Μωὰβ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ· καὶ
ἐγενήθη πνεῦμα Θεοῦ ἐπ᾿ αὐτῷ. Καὶ ἀναλαβὼν τὴν παραβολὴν 7
αὐτοῦ, εἶπεν· ἐκ Μεσοποταμίας μετεπέμψατό με Βαλάκ βασιλεὺς
Μωάβ, ἐξ ὀρέων ἀπ᾿ ἀνατολῶν, λέγων· δεῦρο ἄρασαί μοι τὸν Ἰσ-
ραήλ, καὶ δεῦρο ἐπικατάρασαί μοι τὸν Ἰσραήλ. Τί ἀράσομαι ὃν μὴ 8
ἀρᾶται ὁ Κύριος; ἢ τί καταράσομαι ὃν μὴ καταρᾶται ὁ Θεός; Ὅτι 9
ἀπὸ κορυφῆς ὀρέων ὄψομαι αὐτόν, καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν βουνῶν προσνοή-
σω αὐτόν· ἰδοὺ λαὸς μόνος κατοικήσει, καὶ ἐν ἔθνεσιν οὐ συλλο-
γισθήσεται. Τίς ἐξηκρίβασατο τὸ σπέρμα Ἰακώβ, καὶ τίς ἐξαριθ- 10
μήσεται δήμους Ἰσραήλ; ἀποθάνοι ἡ ψυχή μου ἐν ψυχαῖς δικαίων,
καὶ γένοιτο τὸ σπέρμα μου ὡς τὸ σπέρμα τοῦτο. Καὶ εἶπε Βα- 11
λάκ πρὸς Βαλαάμ· τί ἐποίησάς μοι; εἰς κατάρασιν ἐχθρῶν μου
κέκληκά σε, καὶ ἰδοὺ εὐλόγησας εὐλογίᾳ. Καὶ εἶπε Βαλαὰμ πρὸς 12
Βαλάκ· οὐχὶ ὅσα ἐμβάλῃ ὁ Θεὸς εἰς τὸ στόμα μου, τοῦτο φυλάξω
λαλῆσαι; Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτὸν Βαλάκ· δεῦρο ἔτι μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ εἰς 13
τόπον ἄλλον, ἐξ οὗ οὐκ ὄψῃ αὐτὸν ἐκεῖθεν, ἀλλ᾿ ἢ μέρος τι αὐ-
τοῦ ὄψῃ, πάντας δὲ οὐ μὴ ἴδῃς, καὶ κατάρασαί μοι αὐτὸν ἐκεῖθεν.
Καὶ παρέλαβεν αὐτὸν εἰς ἀγροῦ σκοπιὰν ἐπὶ κορυφὴν λελαξευμέ- 14
νου, καὶ ᾠκοδόμησεν ἐκεῖ ἑπτὰ βωμούς, καὶ ἀνεβίβασε μόσχον
καὶ κριὸν ἐπὶ τὸν βωμόν. Καὶ εἶπε Βαλαὰμ πρὸς Βαλάκ· παρά- 15.

### Chapter 23

**1** And Balaam said unto Balak, "Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams."
**2** And Balak did even as Balaam had spoken unto him; and Balak and Balaam offered up a bullock and a ram upon the altar.
**3** And Balaam said unto Balak, "Stand thou by thy sacrifice, and I shall go; peradventure the Lord God will appear unto me in an encounter, and whatsoever word He shall show unto me, that will I declare unto thee." And Balak stood by his sacrifice; and Balaam went to enquire of God, and he went [forth] directly.
**4** And God appeared unto Balaam; and Balaam said unto Him, "The seven altars have I prepared, and I have brought up a bullock and a ram upon [each] altar."
**5** And God put a word into the mouth of Balaam, and said, "Turn thou back unto Balak, and thus shalt thou speak."
**6** And he turned back unto him; and, behold, he stood by his burnt offerings, he, and all the princes of Moab with him; and the Spirit of God came upon him.
**7** And he took up his parable, and said:
&emsp;"From Mesopotamia hath Balak the King of Moab sent for me,
&emsp;From the mountains of the East, saying,
&emsp;'Come, curse me Israel, and come, imprecate a curse upon Israel for my sake.'
**8** How shall I curse, whom the Lord hath not cursed?
&emsp;Or how shall I call down evil upon, whom God hath not cursed?
**9** For from the top of the mountains shall I behold him,
&emsp;And from the hills shall I discern him;
&emsp;Behold, a people dwelling alone,
&emsp;And among the nations shall they not be reckoned.
**10** Who hath counted the seed of Jacob with precision,
&emsp;And who shall number the multitudes of Israel?
&emsp;May my soul die among the souls of the righteous,
&emsp;And may my offspring be as this seed!"
**11** And Balak said unto Balaam, "What hast thou done unto me? I called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them with [a] blessing!"
**12** And Balaam said unto Balak, "Shall I not take heed to speak this, whatsoever God doth put into my mouth?"
**13** And Balak said unto him, "Come yet with me unto another place, from whence thou shalt not see them from thence; but only a part of them shalt thou see, yet all of them shalt thou not behold, and curse thou them for me from thence."
**14** And he took him to the field of the watchmen, to the top of a hewn peak; and he built there seven altars, and brought up a bullock and a ram upon [each] altar.
**15** And Balaam said unto Balak, "Stand thou—"
