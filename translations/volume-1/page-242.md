ΚΕΦ. ΚΖ΄. ΛΕΥΙΤΙΚΟΝ 227
αὐτοῦ ἅγιον. ᾽Εὰν δὲ πᾶν κτῆνος ἀκάθαρτον, ἀφ᾽ ὧν οὐ προσφέ- 11
ρεται ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν δῶρον τῷ Κυρίῳ, στήσει τὸ κτῆνος ἐναντίον τοῦ
ἱερέως, καὶ τιμήσει αὐτὸ ὁ ἱερεὺς ἀναμέσον καλοῦ καὶ ἀναμέσον 12
πονηροῦ· καὶ καθότι ἂν τιμήσηται ὁ ἱερεύς, οὕτω στήσεται. ᾽Εὰν 13
δὲ λυτρούμενος λυτρώσηται αὐτό, προσθήσει τὸ ἐπίπεμπτον πρὸς
τὴν τιμὴν αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἄνθρωπος ὃς ἂν ἁγιάσει τὴν οἰκίαν αὐτοῦ 14
ἅγιον τῷ Κυρίῳ, καὶ τιμήσεται αὐτὴν ὁ ἱερεὺς ἀναμέσον καλῆς
καὶ ἀναμέσον πονηρᾶς· ὡς ἂν τιμήσηται αὐτὴν ὁ ἱερεύς, οὕτω
σταθήσεται. ᾽Εὰν δὲ ὁ ἁγιάσας αὐτὴν λυτρώσηται τὴν οἰκίαν αὑ- 15
τοῦ, προσθήσει ἐπ᾿ αὐτὸ τὸ ἐπίπεμπτον τοῦ ἀργυρίου τῆς τιμῆς,
καὶ ἔσται αὐτῷ. ᾽Εὰν δὲ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀγροῦ τῆς κατασχέσεως αὐτοῦ 16
ἁγιάσῃ ἄνθρωπος τῷ Κυρίῳ, καὶ ἔσται ἡ τιμὴ κατὰ τὸν σπόρον
αὐτοῦ, χόρου κριθῶν πεντήκοντα δίδραχμα ἀργυρίου. ᾽Εὰν δὲ ἀπὸ 17
τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ τῆς ἀφέσεως ἁγιάσῃ τὸν ἀγρὸν αὐτοῦ, κατὰ τὴν τι-
μὴν αὐτοῦ στήσεται. ᾽Εὰν δὲ ἔσχατον μετὰ τὴν ἄφεσιν ἁγιάσῃ 18
τὸν ἀγρὸν αὐτοῦ, προσλογιεῖται αὐτῷ ὁ ἱερεὺς τὸ ἀργύριον ἐπὶ τὰ
ἔτη τὰ ἐπίλοιπα ἕως εἰς τὸν ἐνιαυτὸν τῆς ἀφέσεως, καὶ ἀνθυ-
φαιρεθήσεται ἀπὸ τῆς συντιμήσεως αὐτοῦ. ᾽Εὰν δὲ λυτρούμενος 19
λυτρῶται τὸν ἀγρὸν ὁ ἁγιάσας αὐτόν, προσθήσει τὸ ἐπίπεμπτον
τοῦ ἀργυρίου πρὸς τὴν τιμὴν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔσται αὐτῷ. ᾽Εὰν δὲ μὴ 20
λυτρῶται τὸν ἀγρόν, καὶ ἀποδῶται τὸν ἀγρὸν ἀνθρώπῳ ἑτέρῳ,
οὐκέτι μὴ λυτρώσεται αὐτόν· ἀλλ᾿ ἔσται ὁ ἀγρὸς ἐξεληλυθίας 21
τῆς ἀφέσεως ἅγιος τῷ Κυρίῳ, ὥσπερ ἡ γῆ ἀφωρισμένη· τῷ ἱερεῖ
ἔσται κατάσχεσις αὐτοῦ. ᾽Εὰν δὲ ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀγροῦ οὗ κέκτηται, ὃς 22
οὐκ ἔστιν ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀγροῦ τῆς κατασχέσεως αὐτοῦ, ἁγιάσῃ τῷ
Κυρίῳ, λογιεῖται πρὸς αὐτὸν ὁ ἱερεὺς τὸ τέλος τῆς τιμῆς ἐκ τοῦ 23
ἐνιαυτοῦ τῆς ἀφέσεως, καὶ ἀποδώσει τὴν τιμὴν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐ-
κείνη ἅγιον τῷ Κυρίῳ· καὶ ἐν τῷ ἐνιαυτῷ τῆς ἀφέσεως ἀποδο- 24
θήσεται ὁ ἀγρὸς τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ παρ᾿ οὗ κέκτηται αὐτόν, οὗ ἦν ἡ
κατάσχεσις τῆς γῆς. Καὶ πᾶσα τιμὴ ἔσται σταθμίοις ἁγίοις· εἴ- 25
κοσι ὀβολοὶ ἔσται τὸ δίδραχμον. Καὶ πᾶν πρωτότοκον, ὃ ἐὰν 26
γένηται ἐν τοῖς κτήνεσί σου, ἔσται τῷ Κυρίῳ, καὶ οὐ καθαγιάσει
αὐτὸ οὐδεὶς· ἐάν τε μόσχον, ἐάν τε πρόβατον, τῷ Κυρίῳ ἐστίν.
᾽Εὰν δὲ τῶν τετραπόδων τῶν ἀκαθάρτων, ἀλλάξει κατὰ τὴν τι- 27
μὴν αὐτοῦ, καὶ προσθήσει τὸ ἐπίπεμπτον πρὸς αὐτό, καὶ ἔσται
αὐτῷ· ἐὰν δὲ μὴ λυτρῶται, πραθήσεται κατὰ τὸ τίμημα αὐτοῦ.

**English Translation:**

11 His holy [possession]. But if it be any unclean beast, from which no gift is brought from them unto the Lord, then he shall present the beast before the priest,
12 and the priest shall value it between good and between bad; and according as the priest shall value it, so shall its worth be fixed.
13 But if he who redeems shall redeem it, he shall add the fifth part unto its valuation.
14 And if a man shall sanctify his house as holy unto the Lord, then the priest shall value it between good and between bad; as the priest shall value it, so shall its worth be fixed.
15 But if he who sanctified it shall redeem his own house, he shall add unto it the fifth part of the silver of the valuation, and it shall be his.
16 And if a man shall sanctify unto the Lord a field of his possession, then the valuation thereof shall be according to its sowing, even fifty didrachmas of silver for a homer of barley.
17 But if he shall sanctify his field from the year of release, it shall stand according to its valuation.
18 And if he shall sanctify his field last, after the release, the priest shall reckon unto him the silver for the remaining years until the year of release, and it shall be proportionately subtracted from its total valuation.
19 But if he who sanctified it shall truly redeem the field, he shall add the fifth part of the silver unto its valuation, and it shall be his.
20 But if he shall not redeem the field, and shall sell the field to another man, he shall no longer redeem it;
21 but the field, when the release hath gone forth, shall be holy unto the Lord, as a land set apart; its possession shall be for the priest.
22 And if he shall sanctify unto the Lord a field which he hath acquired, which is not from the field of his [ancestral] possession,
23 then the priest shall reckon unto him the full valuation from the year of release, and he shall give the valuation in that day as holy unto the Lord.
24 And in the year of release, the field shall be returned to the man from whom he acquired it, whose was the possession of the land.
25 And every valuation shall be according to the holy standard; twenty obols shall be the didrachma.
26 And every firstborn, whatsoever shall be born among thy cattle, shall be the Lord's; and no man shall sanctify it anew; whether it be an ox, or a sheep, it is the Lord's.
27 But if it be among the unclean four-footed beasts, then he shall exchange it according to its valuation, and shall add the fifth part unto it, and it shall be his; but if he shall not redeem it, then it shall be sold according to its estimated worth.
