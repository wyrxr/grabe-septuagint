ὑμῖν ἐν κλήρῳ· ἐγὼ Κύριος. Ἐλάλησε δὲ Μωυσῆς οὕτω τοῖς 9
υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ· καὶ οὐκ εἰσήκουσαν Μωυσῆ ἀπὸ τῆς ὀλιγοψυχίας,
καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ἔργων τῶν σκληρῶν. Εἶπε δὲ Κύριος πρὸς Μω- 10
σῆν, λέγων· εἴσελθε, λάλησον Φαραὼ βασιλεῖ Αἰγύπτου, ἵνα ἐξα- 11

μου, καὶ πῶς εἰσακούσεταί μου Φαραώ; ἐγὼ δὲ ἄλογός εἰμι.
Εἶπε δὲ Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν καὶ Ἀαρών, καὶ συνέταξεν αὐτοῖς 13

**CHAPTER VI**

...[as] an inheritance unto you: I am the Lord.
9 And Moses spake thus unto the sons of Israel; but they did not hearken unto Moses, by reason of their faintness of spirit, and by reason of their hard works.
10 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
11 Go thou in, and speak unto Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, that he may send forth the sons of Israel out of his land.
12 And Moses spake before the Lord, saying, Behold, the sons of Israel have not hearkened unto me; and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me, for I am uneloquent?
13 And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, to bring forth the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt.

14 And these are the heads of their fathers’ houses: The sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel: Enoch, and Phallous, and Asron, and Charmi. These are the families of Reuben.
15 And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ahod, and Jachin, and Saar, and Shaul, [the son] of the Phoenician woman. These are the families of the sons of Simeon.
16 And these are the names of the sons of Levi, according to their families: Gedson, Kaath, and Merari. And the years of the life of Levi were one hundred thirty and seven.
17 And these are the sons of Gedson: Lobeni, and Semei; these are their fathers’ houses.
18 And the sons of Kaath: Ambram, and Issa-ar, Chebron, and Ozeiel. And the years of the life of Kaath were one hundred thirty and three years.
19 And the sons of Merari: Moolei, and Omousei. These are the houses of the families of Levi, according to their generations.
20 And Ambram took Jochabed, the daughter of his father’s brother, for himself as a wife; and she bore unto him both Aaron, and Moses, and Mariam their sister. And the years of the life of Ambram were one hundred thirty and six years.
21 And the sons of Issa-ar: Kore, and Naphech, and Zechrei.
22 And the sons of Ozeiel: Misael, and Elisaphan, and Segrei.
23 And Aaron took Elisabed, the daughter of Ameinadab, the sister of Naasson, for himself as a wife; and she bore unto him both Nadab, and Abioud, and Eleazar, and Ithamar.
24 And the sons of Kore: Aser, and Elkanah, and Abiasar. These are the generations of Kore.
25 And Eleazar, the son of Aaron, took [one] of the daughters of Poutiel for himself as a wife; and she bore unto him Phinees. These are the heads of the families of the Levites, according to their generations.

26 This is that Aaron and Moses, unto whom God spake to bring forth the sons of Israel out of Egypt with their own host.
27 These are they who spake unto Pharaoh, the king of Egypt; and they brought forth the sons of Israel out of Egypt, even Aaron and Moses themselves.
