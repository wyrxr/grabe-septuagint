ΚΕΦ. Η΄. Θ΄.
28 τρόπον συνέταξε Κύριος τῷ Ἰησοῖ. Καὶ ἐνεπύρισεν Ἰησοῦς τὴν
    πόλιν ἐν πυρί· χῶμα ἀοίκητον εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα ἔθηκεν αὐτὴν ἕως
    τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης. Καὶ τὸν βασιλέα τῆς Γαῒ ἐκρέμασεν ἐπὶ ξύ-
    λου διδύμου, καὶ ἦν ἐπὶ τοῦ ξύλου ἕως καιροῦ τῆς ἑσπέρας· καὶ
    ἐπιδύνοντος τοῦ ἡλίου συνέταξεν Ἰησοῦς, καὶ καθεῖλον τὸ σῶμα
    αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τοῦ ξύλου, καὶ ἐξέῤῥιψαν αὐτὸ εἰς τὸν βόθρον πρὸς τὴν
    πύλην τῆς πόλεως, καὶ ἐπέστησαν αὐτῷ σωρὸν λίθων μέγαν ἕως
30 τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης. Τότε ᾠκοδόμησεν Ἰησοῦς θυσιαστήριον τῷ
31 Κυρίῳ Θεῷ Ἰσραὴλ ἐν ὄρει Γαιβάλ, καθότι ἐνετείλατο Μωυσῆς
    ὁ θεράπων Κυρίου τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ, καθὰ γέγραπται ἐν τῷ νό-
    μῳ Μωυσῇ, θυσιαστήριον λίθων ὁλοκλήρων, ἐφ’ οὗς οὐκ ἐπεβλήθη
    ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς σίδηρος· καὶ ἀνεβίβασεν ἐκεῖ ὁλοκαυτώματα τῷ Κυ-
32 ρίῳ καὶ θυσίας σωτηρίου εἰρηνικάς. Καὶ ἔγραψεν Ἰησοῦς ἐπὶ τῶν
    λίθων τὸ Δευτερονόμιον, νόμον Μωυσῇ, ὃν ἔγραψεν ἐνώπιον τῶν
33 υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ πᾶς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι αὐτῶν, καὶ
    οἱ δικασταὶ αὐτῶν, καὶ γραμματεῖς αὐτῶν παρεπορεύοντο ἔνθεν
    καὶ ἔνθεν τῆς κιβωτοῦ ἀπέναντι, (καὶ οἱ ἱερεῖς οἱ Λευῖται ἦσαν
    τὴν κιβωτὸν τῆς διαθήκης Κυρίου) καὶ ὁ προσήλυτος, καὶ ὁ αὐ-
    τόχθων· ἦσαν οἱ ἡμίσεις πλησίον ὄρους Γαριζείν, καὶ οἱ ἡμίσεις
    αὐτῶν πλησίον ὄρους Γαιβάλ, καθὰ ἐνετείλατο Μωυσῆς ὁ θερά-
34 πων Κυρίου εὐλογῆσαι τὸν λαὸν Ἰσραὴλ ἐν πρώτοις. Καὶ μετὰ
    ταῦτα ἀνέγνω πάντα τὰ ῥήματα τοῦ νόμου τούτου, τὰς εὐλογίας
    καὶ τὰς κατάρας κατὰ πάντα τὰ γεγραμμένα ἐν τῷ νόμῳ Μωυ-
35 σῇ· οὐκ ἦν ῥῆμα ἀπὸ πάντων ὧν ἐνετείλατο Μωυσῆς τῷ Ἰησοῦ,
    ὃ οὐκ ἀνέγνω Ἰησοῦς εἰς τὰ ὦτα πάσης ἐκκλησίας Ἰσραήλ, τοῖς
    ἀνδράσι καὶ ταῖς γυναιξὶ καὶ τοῖς παιδίοις, καὶ τοῖς προσηλύτοις
    τοῖς προσπορευομένοις τῷ Ἰσραήλ.

ΚΕΦ. Θ΄. ΙΧ.

1 ὩΣ δὲ ἤκουσαν πάντες οἱ βασιλεῖς τῶν Ἀμοῤῥαίων οἱ ἐν τῷ
    πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου, οἱ ἐν τῇ ὀρεινῇ, καὶ οἱ ἐν τῇ πεδινῇ, καὶ
    οἱ ἐν πάσῃ τῇ παραλίᾳ τῆς θαλάσσης τῆς μεγάλης, καὶ οἱ πρὸς
    τῷ Ἀντιλιβάνῳ, καὶ οἱ Χετταῖοι, καὶ οἱ Ἀμοῤῥαῖοι, καὶ οἱ Γερ-
2 γεσσαῖοι, καὶ οἱ Χαναναῖοι, καὶ οἱ Φερεζαῖοι, καὶ οἱ Εὐαῖοι, καὶ
    οἱ Ἰεβουσαῖοι, καὶ συνῆλθον ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό, ἐκπολεμῆσαι Ἰησοῦν

**Joshua 8**
28 ...the manner which the Lord had commanded Joshua. And Joshua burned the city with fire; and he made it an uninhabitable heap for ever, even unto this very day. And the king of Ai he hanged upon a double beam, and he remained upon the wood until the time of evening; and when the sun was setting, Joshua commanded, and they took down his body from the wood, and cast it into the pit by the gate of the city; and they set over him a great heap of stones, [which remains] until
30 this very day.
Then did Joshua build an altar unto the Lord God of Israel in Mount Ebal,
31 according as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded the sons of Israel, as it is written in the law of Moses: an altar of whole stones, upon the which no iron tool had been laid; and there he offered up burnt offerings unto the Lord, and sacrifices of saving peace offerings.
32 And Joshua wrote upon the stones the Deuteronomic law, even the law of Moses, which he had written before the sons of Israel.
33 And all Israel, and their elders, and their judges, and their scribes, passed on this side and on that side before the ark, (and the priests, the Levites, [were carrying] the ark of the covenant of the Lord), both the sojourner and the native-born; half of them stood before Mount Gerizim, and the other half of them before Mount Ebal, according as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded to bless the people of Israel in the first instance.
34 And after these things, he read all the words of this law, the blessings and the curses, according to all that is written in the law of Moses.
35 There was not a word of all that Moses commanded Joshua, which Joshua did not read in the hearing of all the congregation of Israel, both to the men, and to the women, and to the children, and to the sojourners who sojourned among Israel.

**Joshua 9**
1 Now when all the kings of the Amorites who were beyond Jordan heard, [even] those in the hill country, and those in the plain, and those in all the coast of the Great Sea, and those toward Anti-Lebanon; the Hittites also, and the Amorites, and the Girgashites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites,
2 they gathered themselves together to fight with Joshua...
