αὐτοῦ τὰς γεγραμμένας ἐν τῷ βιβλίῳ τοῦ νόμου τούτου, ἐὰν ἐπιστραφῇς ἐπὶ Κύριον τὸν Θεόν σου ἐξ ὅλης τῆς καρδίας σου καὶ
11 ἐξ ὅλης τῆς ψυχῆς σου. Ὅτι ἡ ἐντολὴ αὕτη ἣν ἐγὼ ἐντέλλομαί
   σοι σήμερον, οὐχ ὑπέρογκός ἐστιν, οὐδὲ μακρὰν ἀπὸ σοῦ ἐστιν·
12 οὐκ ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ (ἄνω) ἐστί, λέγων· τίς ἀναβήσεται ἡμῖν εἰς
   τὸν οὐρανόν, καὶ λήψεται ἡμῖν αὐτήν, καὶ ἀκούσαντες αὐτήν, ποιή-
13 σομεν αὐτήν ; οὐδὲ πέραν τῆς θαλάσσης ἐστί, λέγων· τίς διαπε-
   ράσει ἡμῖν εἰς τὸ πέραν τῆς θαλάσσης, καὶ λήψεται ἡμῖν αὐτήν,
14 καὶ ἀκούσαντες αὐτήν, ποιήσομεν αὐτήν ; ἐγγύς σου ἐστι τὸ ῥῆ-
   μα σφόδρα ἐν τῷ στόματί σου, καὶ ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ σου, καὶ ἐν
15 ταῖς χερσί σου, ποιεῖν αὐτό. Ἰδοὺ δέδωκα πρὸ προσώπου σου σή-
16 μερον τὴν ζωὴν καὶ τὸν θάνατον, τὸ ἀγαθὸν καὶ τὸ κακόν. Ἐὰν
   δὲ εἰσακούσητε τὰς ἐντολὰς Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ ὑμῶν ὅσας ἐγὼ
   ἐντέλλομαι σοι σήμερον, ἀγαπᾶν Κύριον τὸν Θεόν σου, πορεύεσθαι
   ἐν πάσαις ταῖς ὁδοῖς αὐτοῦ, καὶ φυλάσσειν τὰς ἐντολὰς αὐτοῦ,
   καὶ τὰ δικαιώματα αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὰς κρίσεις αὐτοῦ, καὶ ζήσεσθε,
   καὶ πολλοὶ ἔσεσθε, καὶ εὐλογήσει σε Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου ἐν πάσῃ
17 τῇ γῇ, εἰς ἣν σὺ εἰσπορεύῃ ἐκεῖ, κληρονομῆσαι αὐτήν. Καὶ ἐὰν
   μεταστῇ ἡ καρδία σου, καὶ μὴ εἰσακούσῃς, καὶ πλανηθεὶς προ-
18 σκυνήσῃς θεοῖς ἑτέροις, καὶ λατρεύσῃς αὐτοῖς, ἀναγγέλλω σοι σή-
   μερον, ὅτι ἀπωλείᾳ ἀπολεῖσθε, καὶ οὐ μὴ πολυήμεροι γένησθε ἐπὶ
   τῆς γῆς, ἧς Κύριος ὁ Θεός σου δίδωσί σοι, εἰς ἣν ὑμεῖς δια-
19 βαίνετε τὸν Ἰορδάνην εἰσελθεῖν ἐκεῖ, κληρονομῆσαι αὐτήν. Διαμαρ-
   τύρομαι ὑμῖν σήμερον τόν τε οὐρανὸν καὶ τὴν γῆν· τὴν ζωὴν καὶ
   τὸν θάνατον δέδωκα πρὸ προσώπου ὑμῶν, τὴν εὐλογίαν καὶ τὴν
   κατάραν· καὶ ἔκλεξαι τὴν ζωήν, ἵνα ζῇς σὺ καὶ τὸ σπέρμα σου,
20 ἀγαπᾷν Κύριον τὸν Θεόν σου, εἰσακούειν τῆς φωνῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ
   ἔχεσθαι αὐτοῦ· ὅτι τοῦτο ἡ ζωή σου καὶ ἡ μακρότης τῶν ἡμερῶν
   σου, κατοικεῖν σε ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, ἧς ὤμοσε Κύριος τοῖς πατράσι
   σου, Ἀβραὰμ καὶ Ἰσαὰκ καὶ Ἰακώβ, δοῦναι αὐτοῖς.

**Deuteronomy 30**
10 His judgments, which are written in the book of this law, if thou shalt turn again unto the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul.
11 For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not too grievous for thee, neither is it far from thee.
12 It is not in heaven (above), that thou shouldst say, 'Who shall ascend for us into heaven, and take it for us, and hearing it, we shall do it?'
13 Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldst say, 'Who shall cross over for us to the other side of the sea, and take it for us, and hearing it, we shall do it?'
14 But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, and in thy hands, that thou mayest do it.
15 Behold, I have set before thy face this day life and death, the good and the evil.
16 If ye shall hearken unto the commandments of the Lord your God, which I command thee this day, [namely,] to love the Lord thy God, to walk in all His ways, and to keep His commandments, and His ordinances, and His judgments, then ye shall live, and ye shall be many, and the Lord thy God shall bless thee in all the land, into which thou goest to enter there, to inherit it.
17 But if thy heart turn away, and thou wilt not hearken, and being led astray, thou shalt worship other gods, and serve them,
18 I declare unto thee this day, that ye shall utterly perish, and ye shall not prolong your days upon the land, which the Lord thy God giveth unto thee, whither ye cross over Jordan to enter there, to inherit it.
19 I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day: I have set before your face life and death, the blessing and the curse; therefore choose life, that thou and thy seed may live,
20 [Namely,] to love the Lord thy God, to hearken unto His voice, and to cleave unto Him; for this is thy life and the length of thy days, that thou mayest dwell upon the land which the Lord sware unto thy fathers, Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them.

**Deuteronomy 31**
1 And Moses finished speaking all these words unto all the sons of Israel.
2 And he said unto them: "I am this day one hundred and twenty years old; I can no longer go in or..."
