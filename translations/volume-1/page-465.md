ΚΡΙΤΑΙ ΚΕΦ. ΙΑ´.
παρεγένετο κατ᾿ ἀνατολὰς ἡλίου τῆς γῆς Μωάβ, καὶ παρενέβα-
λον ἐν τῷ πέραν Ἀρνῶν, καὶ οὐκ εἰσῆλθον εἰς τὸ ὅριον Μωάβ,
**19** ὅτι Ἀρνῶν ἦν ὅριον Μωάβ. Καὶ ἀπέστειλεν Ἰσραὴλ ἀγγέλους πρὸς
    Σηὼν βασιλέα Ἑσεβών, βασιλέα τῶν Ἀμοῤῥαίων, καὶ εἶπεν αὐ-
    τῷ Ἰσραήλ· παρελεύσομαι δὴ διὰ τῆς γῆς σου ἕως τοῦ τόπου
**20** μου. Καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησε Σηὼν διελθεῖν τὸν Ἰσραὴλ διὰ τῶν ὁρίων
    αὐτοῦ· καὶ συνήγαγε Σηὼν πάντα τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ, καὶ παρενέ-
**21** βαλεν ἐν Ἰασᾶ, καὶ ἐπολέμησε μετὰ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ παρέδωκε Κύ-
    ριος ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσραὴλ τὸν Σηὼν καὶ πάντα τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ ἐν χει-
    ρὶ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐπάταξεν αὐτούς· καὶ ἐκληρονόμησεν Ἰσραὴλ πᾶσαν
**22** τὴν γῆν τοῦ Ἀμοῤῥαίου τοῦ κατοικοῦντος ἐν τῇ γῇ ἐκείνῃ· καὶ ἐκλη-
    ρονόμησε πᾶν τὸ ὅριον τοῦ Ἀμοῤῥαίου, ἀπὸ Ἀρνῶν καὶ ἕως τοῦ Ἰαβὸκ
    καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς ἐρήμου καὶ ἕως τοῦ Ἰορδάνου.
**23** Καὶ νῦν Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἐξεῖλε τὸν Ἀμοῤῥαῖον ἐκ προσώπου τοῦ λαοῦ
    αὐτοῦ Ἰσραήλ, καὶ σὺ κληρονομήσεις αὐτὸν ἐπὶ σοῦ;
**24** οὐχὶ ὅσα κατεκληρονόμησέ σοι Χαμὼς ὁ Θεός σου, αὐτὰ κληρονομήσεις;
    καὶ πάντα ὅσα κατεκληρονόμησεν ἡμῖν Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν ἀπὸ
    προσώπου ἡμῶν, αὐτὰ κληρονομήμεν.
**25** Καὶ νῦν μὴ κρείσσων εἶ σὺ τοῦ Βαλὰκ υἱοῦ Σεπφώρ, βασι-
    λέως Μωάβ; μὴ μάχῃ ἐμαχέσατο μετὰ Ἰσραήλ, ἢ πολεμῶν ἐπο-
**26** λέμησεν ἐν αὐτοῖς; Ἐν τῷ οἰκῆσαι Ἰσραὴλ ἐν Ἑσεβὼν καὶ ἐν ταῖς
    θυγατράσιν αὐτῆς, καὶ ἐν Ἀροὴρ καὶ ἐν ταῖς θυγατράσιν αὐτῆς, καὶ
    ἐν πάσαις ταῖς πόλεσι ταῖς παρὰ τὸν Ἰορδάνην τριακόσια ἔτη, τί
**27** ὅτι οὐκ ἐρύσαντο αὐτοὺς ἐν τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ; Καὶ ἐγὼ οὐχ ἥμαρτόν
    σοι, καὶ σὺ ποιεῖς μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ πονηρίαν, τοῦ πολεμῆσαι ἐν ἐμοί·
    κρίναι δὲ Κύριος ὁ κρίνων σήμερον ἀναμέσον τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ καὶ
**28** ἀναμέσον τῶν υἱῶν Ἀμμών. Καὶ οὐκ εἰσήκουσε βασιλεὺς υἱῶν
    Ἀμμὼν (καὶ οὐκ εἰσήκουσε) τῶν λόγων Ἰεφθάε, ὧν ἀπέστειλε πρὸς
    αὐτόν.
**29** Καὶ ἐγενήθη ἐπὶ Ἰεφθάε πνεῦμα Κυρίου, καὶ διέβη τὴν γῆν
    Γαλαάδ, καὶ τὸν Μανασσῆ· καὶ διέβη τὴν σκοπιὰν Γαλαάδ, καὶ
    ἀπὸ σκοπιᾶς Γαλαὰδ εἰς τὸ πέραν υἱῶν Ἀμμών.
**30** Καὶ ηὔξατο Ἰεφθάε εὐχὴν τῷ Κυρίῳ, καὶ εἶπεν· ἐὰν παραδώσει
    παραδῷς μοι τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἀμμὼν ἐν χειρί μου,
**31** καὶ ἔσται ὁ ἐκπορευόμενος ὃς ἂν ἐξέλθῃ ἐκ τῶν θυρῶν τοῦ οἴκου μου
    εἰς ἀπάντησίν μου, ἐν τῷ ἐπιστρέψαι με ἐν εἰρήνῃ ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν
    Ἀμμών, καὶ ἔσται τῷ Κυρίῳ καὶ ἀνοίσω, αὐτὸν ὁλοκαύτωμα.
**32** Καὶ διέβη Ἰεφθάε πρὸς τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἀμμών, τοῦ πολεμῆσαι πρὸς αὐτούς·
    καὶ παρέδωκεν αὐτοὺς Κύριος ἐν χειρὶ αὐτοῦ.

### Judges Chapter 11

**18.** he passed along the east side of the land of Moab, and they encamped on the other side of Arnon, and entered not into the border of Moab,
**19.** for Arnon was the border of Moab. And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon, king of Heshbon, king of the Amorites, and Israel said unto him, "Let me pass, I pray thee, through thy land unto my place."
**20.** But Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his borders; and Sihon gathered all his people, and encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.
**21.** And the Lord God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and he smote them; and Israel inherited all
**22.** the land of the Amorite who dwelt in that land; and he inherited all the border of the Amorite, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto the Jordan.
**23.** And now the Lord God hath dispossessed the Amorite from before His people Israel, and wilt thou inherit him for thyself?
**24.** Wilt thou not inherit whatsoever Chemosh thy god hath bequeathed unto thee? And whatsoever the Lord our God hath bequeathed unto us from before us, that will we inherit.
**25.** And now, art thou better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever contend in battle with Israel, or fight against them in war?
**26.** While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and its villages, and in Aroer and its villages, and in all the cities along the Jordan for three hundred years, why did ye not rescue them in that time?
**27.** And I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest evil against me, to fight against me; the Lord, the Judge, judge this day between the children of Israel and between the children of Ammon.
**28.** But the king of the children of Ammon did not hearken (and he did not hearken) unto the words of Jephthah which he sent unto him.
**29.** And the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah, and he passed through the land of Gilead and Manasseh; and he passed over the watchtower of Gilead, and from the watchtower of Gilead unto the other side of the children of Ammon.
**30.** And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the Lord, and said, "If Thou wilt surely deliver the children of Ammon into my hand,
**31.** then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, it shall surely be the Lord's, and I will offer him for a burnt offering."
**32.** So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the Lord delivered them into his hand.
