200 ΛΕΥΙΤΙΚΟΝ ΚΕΦ. ΙΔ´. ΙΕ´.
Ξύλα αὐτῆς, καὶ τοὺς λίθους αὐτῆς, καὶ πάντα τὸν χοῦν τῆς οἰκίας
46 ἐξοίσουσιν ἔξω τῆς πόλεως εἰς τόπον ἀκάθαρτον. Καὶ ὁ εἰσπορευόμενος
εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας, ἃς ἀφωρισμένη
47 ἐστίν, ἀκάθαρτος ἔσται ἕως ἑσπέρας· καὶ ὁ κοιμώμενος ἐν τῇ
οἰκίᾳ, πλυνεῖ τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀκάθαρτος ἔσται ἕως ἑσπέρας·
48 καὶ ὁ ἔσθων ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ, πλυνεῖ τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀκάθαρτος
ἔσται ἕως ἑσπέρας. Ἐὰν δὲ παραγενόμενος εἰσέλθῃ ὁ ἱερεύς, καὶ
ἴδῃ, καὶ ἰδοὺ (οὐ) διαχέεται οὐ διαχέεται ἡ ἁφὴ ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ μετὰ τὸ
ἐξαλειφθῆναι τὴν οἰκίαν, καὶ καθαριεῖ ὁ ἱερεὺς τὴν
49 οἰκίαν, ὅτι ἰάθη ἡ ἁφὴ καὶ λήψεται ἀφαγνίσαι τὴν οἰκίαν δύο
ὀρνίδια ζῶντα καθαρά, καὶ ξύλον κέδρινον, καὶ κεχλωμένον κόκκινον,
50 καὶ ὕσσωπον· καὶ σφάξει τὸ ὀρνίδιον τὸ ἓν εἰς σκεῦος ὀστράκινον
ἐφ᾿ ὕδατι ζῶντι·
51 καὶ λήψεται τὸ ξύλον τὸ κέδρινον, καὶ τὸ κεχλωμένον κόκκινον,
καὶ τὸν ὕσσωπον, καὶ τὸ ὀρνίδιον τὸ ζῶν, καὶ βάψει αὐτὸ εἰς τὸ
αἷμα τοῦ ὀρνιδίου τοῦ ἐσφαγμένου ἐφ᾿ ὕδατι ζῶντι, καὶ περιῤῥανεῖ
ἐν αὐτοῖς ἐπὶ τὴν οἰκίαν ἑπτάκις·
52 καὶ ἀφαγνιεῖ τὴν οἰκίαν ἐν τῷ αἵματι τοῦ ὀρνιδίου, καὶ ἐν τῷ
ὕδατι τῷ ζῶντι, καὶ ἐν τῷ ὀρνιδίῳ τῷ ζῶντι, καὶ ἐν τῷ ξύλῳ
53 τῷ κεδρίνῳ, καὶ ἐν τῷ ὑσσώπῳ, καὶ ἐν τῷ κεχλωμένῳ κοκκίνῳ·
καὶ ἐξαποστελεῖ τὸ ὀρνίδιον τὸ ζῶν ἔξω πόλεως εἰς τὸ πεδίον,
54 καὶ ἐξιλάσεται περὶ τῆς οἰκίας, καὶ καθαρὰ ἔσται. Οὗτος ὁ
55 νόμος κατὰ πᾶσαν ἀφὴν λέπρας, καὶ θραύσματος, καὶ τῆς λέπρας
56 ἱματίου καὶ οἰκίας, καὶ οὐλῆς, καὶ σημασίας, καὶ τοῦ αὐγάζοντος,
57 καὶ τοῦ ἐξηγήσασθαι ἢ ἡμέρα ἀκάθαρτον, καὶ ἢ ἡμέρα καθαρισθήσεται·
οὗτος ὁ νόμος τῆς λέπρας.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΕ´. XV.

1 ΚΑΙ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν καὶ Ἀαρών, λέγων·
2 λάλησον ταῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐρεῖς αὐτοῖς· ἀνδρὶ ἀνδρὶ ᾧ ἐὰν
3 γένηται ῥύσις ἐκ τοῦ σώματος αὐτοῦ, ἀκάθαρτος ἐστι. Καὶ οὗτος
ὁ νόμος τῆς ἀκαθαρσίας αὐτοῦ· ῥέων γόνον ἐκ σώματος αὐτοῦ
ἐκ τῆς ῥύσεως, ἧς συνέστηκε τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ διὰ τῆς ῥύσεως,
αὕτη ἡ ἀκαθαρσία αὐτοῦ ἐν αὐτῷ· πᾶσαι αἱ ἡμέραι ῥύσεως σώματος
αὐτοῦ, ἢ συνέστηκε τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ διὰ τῆς ῥύσεως, ἀκαθαρ-

### LEVITICUS CHAPTER 14

46 Her timbers, and her stones, and all the dust of the house, shall they carry forth outside the city unto an unclean place.
47 And he that entereth into the house all the days that it is set apart, shall be unclean until the evening; and he that lieth down in the house, he shall wash his garments, and shall be unclean until the evening;
48 and he that eateth in the house, he shall wash his garments, and shall be unclean until the evening. But if the priest shall come and enter, and shall see, and behold, (not) does the infection spread, [yea,] it spreads not in the house, after the house has been scraped and replastered,
49 then shall the priest cleanse the house, for the infection has been healed. And he shall take for the cleansing of the house two live clean birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet yarn,
50 and hyssop; and he shall slaughter the one bird into an earthenware vessel over running water.
51 And he shall take the cedar wood, and the scarlet yarn, and the hyssop, and the live bird, and shall dip them into the blood of the slaughtered bird, [which is] over the running water, and he shall sprinkle the house therewith seven times.
52 And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the live bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet yarn.
53 And he shall send forth the live bird outside the city into the open field,
54 and he shall make propitiation for the house, and it shall be clean.
55 This is the law for every infection of leprosy, and for a breaking out, and for the leprosy of a garment and of a house,
56 and for a scar, and for a spot, and for that which shines forth,
57 and for declaring whether [it be] an unclean day, and whether [it be] a day [when it] shall be cleansed. This is the law of leprosy.

### CHAPTER 15

1 AND the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying:
2 "Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: Whosoever among men, [any] man, shall have a discharge from his body, he is unclean.
3 And this is the law of his uncleanness: He that hath a flow of seed from his body, from the discharge, by which his body is constituted through the discharge—this is his uncleanness in him. All the days of the discharge from his body, or [the days wherein] his body is constituted through the discharge, his uncleanness it is.
4 Every bed, whereon he that hath the flux shall lie, shall be unclean;
