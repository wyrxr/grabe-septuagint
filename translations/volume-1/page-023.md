23 Μαθουσάλα, διακόσια ἔτη, καὶ ἐγέννησεν υἱοὺς καὶ θυγατέρας· καὶ
24 ἐγένοντο πᾶσαι αἱ ἡμέραι Ἑνὼχ τριακόσια ἑξηκονταπέντε ἔτη· καὶ
εὐηρέστησεν Ἑνὼχ τῷ Θεῷ, καὶ οὐχ ηὑρίσκετο, διότι μετέθηκεν
25 αὐτὸν ὁ Θεός. Καὶ ἔζησε Μαθουσάλα ἑκατὸν καὶ ὀγδοηκονταεπτά
26 ἔτη, καὶ ἐγέννησε τὸν Λάμεχ· καὶ ἔζησε Μαθουσάλα μετὰ τὸ
γεννῆσαι αὐτὸν τὸν Λάμεχ, ἑπτακόσια καὶ ὀγδοηκονταδύο ἔτη, καὶ
27 ἐγέννησεν υἱοὺς καὶ θυγατέρας· καὶ ἐγένοντο πᾶσαι αἱ ἡμέραι Μαθουσάλα
