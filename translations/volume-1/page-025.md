13 τὴν ὁδὸν αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς. Καὶ εἶπεν ὁ Θεὸς πρὸς Νῶε· καιρὸς
   παντὸς ἀνθρώπου ἥκει ἐναντίον μου, ὅτι ἐπλήσθη ἡ γῆ ἀδικίας
   ἀπ᾿ αὐτῶν· καὶ ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ καταφθείρω αὐτοὺς καὶ τὴν γῆν.
14 Ποίησον οὖν σεαυτῷ κιβωτὸν ἐκ ξύλων τετραγώνων· νοσσιὰς
   ποιήσεις τὴν κιβωτόν, καὶ ἀσφαλτώσεις αὐτὴν ἔσωθεν καὶ ἔξωθεν
   τῇ ἀσφάλτῳ.
15 Καὶ οὕτως ποιήσεις τὴν κιβωτόν· τριακοσίων πήχεων τὸ μῆκος
   τῆς κιβωτοῦ, καὶ πεντήκοντα πήχεων τὸ πλάτος, καὶ τριάκοντα
   πήχεων τὸ ὕψος αὐτῆς.
16 Ἐπισυνάγων ποιήσεις τὴν κιβωτόν, καὶ εἰς πῆχυν συντελέσεις
   αὐτὴν ἄνωθεν, τὴν δὲ θύραν τῆς κιβωτοῦ ποιήσεις ἐκ πλαγίων·
   κατάγαια διώροφα καὶ τριώροφα ποιήσεις αὐτήν.
17 Ἐγὼ δὲ ἰδοὺ ἐπάγω τὸν κατακλυσμόν, ὕδωρ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν,
   καταφθεῖραι πᾶσαν σάρκα, ἐν ᾗ ἐστιν ἐν αὐτῇ πνεῦμα ζωῆς
   ὑποκάτω τοῦ οὐρανοῦ· καὶ ὅσα ἐὰν ᾖ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς τελευτήσει.
18 Καὶ στήσω τὴν διαθήκην μου πρὸς σε· εἰσελεύσῃ δὲ εἰς τὴν
   κιβωτὸν σὺ καὶ οἱ υἱοί σου, καὶ ἡ γυνή σου, καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες
   τῶν υἱῶν σου μετὰ σοῦ.
19 Καὶ ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν κτηνῶν, καὶ ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν ἑρπετῶν,
   καὶ ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν θηρίων, καὶ ἀπὸ πάσης σαρκός, δύο δύο
   ἀπὸ πάντων εἰσάξεις εἰς τὴν κιβωτόν, ἵνα τρέφῃς μετὰ σεαυτοῦ·
20 ἄρσεν καὶ θῆλυ ἔσονται. Ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν ὀρνέων τῶν πετεινῶν
   κατὰ γένος, καὶ ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν κτηνῶν κατὰ γένος, καὶ ἀπὸ
   πάντων τῶν ἑρπετῶν τῶν ἑρπόντων ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς κατὰ γένος αὐτῶν,
   δύο δύο ἀπὸ πάντων εἰσελεύσονται πρὸς σε, τρέφεσθαι μετὰ σοῦ,
   ἄρσεν καὶ θῆλυ.
21 Σὺ δὲ λήψῃ σεαυτῷ ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν βρωμάτων ἃ ἔδεσθε, καὶ
   συνάξεις πρὸς σεαυτόν, καὶ ἔσται σοι καὶ ἐκείνοις φαγεῖν.
22 Καὶ ἐποίησε Νῶε· πάντα ὅσα ἐνετείλατο αὐτῷ Κύριος ὁ Θεός,
   οὕτως ἐποίησε.

ΚΕΦ. Ζ´. VII.

1 ΚΑΙ εἶπε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς πρὸς Νῶε· εἴσελθε σὺ καὶ πᾶς ὁ οἶκός
   σου εἰς τὴν κιβωτόν, ὅτι σὲ ἴδον δίκαιον ἐναντίον μου ἐν τῇ
   γενεᾷ ταύτῃ.
2 Ἀπὸ δὲ τῶν κτηνῶν τῶν καθαρῶν εἰσάγαγε πρὸς σὲ ἑπτὰ ἑπτά,
   ἄρσεν καὶ θῆλυ· ἀπὸ δὲ τῶν κτηνῶν τῶν μὴ καθαρῶν δύο δύο,
   ἄρσεν καὶ θῆλυ.
3 Καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν πετεινῶν τοῦ οὐρανοῦ τῶν καθαρῶν ἑπτὰ ἑπτά,
   ἄρσεν καὶ θῆλυ· καὶ ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν πετεινῶν τῶν μὴ καθαρῶν
   δύο δύο, ἄρσεν καὶ θῆλυ,

**Chapter 6**

13 his way upon the earth. And God said unto Noah, "The time of
   all mankind is come before Me, for the earth is filled with
   unrighteousness by them; and behold, I shall destroy them,
   and the earth.

14 Make thou an ark of squared timbers for thyself; compartments
   shalt thou make for the ark, and thou shalt pitch it within
   and without with pitch.

15 And in this manner shalt thou make the ark: Three hundred cubits
   shall be the length of the ark, and fifty cubits its breadth,
   and thirty cubits its height.

16 Bringing its parts together, thou shalt make the ark, and to a
   cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt
   thou set in its side. With lower, second, and third stories
   shalt thou make it.

17 For I, behold, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to
   destroy all flesh, in which there is within it the breath of life,
   from under heaven; and whatsoever is upon the earth shall perish.

18 But with thee will I establish My covenant; and thou shalt come
   into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons'
   wives with thee.

19 And of all the beasts, and of all the creeping things, and of all
   the wild animals, and of all flesh, two by two of every sort
   shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee.

20 Male and female shall they be. Of all the fowls of the air after
   their kind, and of all the beasts after their kind, and of all
   the creeping things that creep upon the earth after their kind,
   two by two of every sort shall come unto thee, to be kept alive
   with thee, male and female.

21 And thou shalt take unto thyself of all food that is eaten, and
   shalt gather it to thyself; and it shall be for food for thee,
   and for them.

22 Thus did Noah; according to all that the Lord God commanded him,
   so did he.

**Chapter 7**

1 And the Lord God said unto Noah, "Come thou and all thy household
   into the ark, for thee have I found righteous before Me in this
   generation.

2 Of clean beasts shalt thou take unto thee by sevens, the male and
   the female; and of beasts that are not clean, by twos, the male
   and the female.

3 And of the fowls of the air that are clean, by sevens, the male
   and the female; and of all fowls that are not clean, by twos,
   the male and the female,
