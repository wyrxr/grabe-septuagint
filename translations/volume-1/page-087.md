           ΓΕΝΕΣΙΣ ΚΕΦ. ΛΘ΄. Μ.
14 δεῦτε, εἰσήγαγεν ἡμῖν παῖδα Ἑβραῖον, ἐμπαίζειν ἡμῖν. Εἰσῆλθε
15 πρὸς με, λέγων· κοιμήθητι μετ’ ἐμοῦ· καὶ ἐβόησα φωνῇ μεγάλῃ.
    Ἐν δὲ τῷ ἀκοῦσαι αὐτὸν ὅτι ὕψωσα τὴν φωνήν μου καὶ ἐβόησα,
    καταλιπὼν τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ παρ’ ἐμοί, ἔφυγε, καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ἔξω.
16 Καὶ καταλιμπάνει τὰ ἱμάτια παρ’ ἑαυτῇ, ἕως ἦλθεν ὁ κύριος
17 αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐλάλησεν αὐτῷ κατὰ τὰ ῥήματα
    ταῦτα, λέγουσα· εἰσῆλθε πρός με ὁ παῖς Ἑβραῖος, ὃν εἰσήγαγες
    πρὸς ἡμᾶς ἐμπαῖξαί μοι, καὶ εἶπέ μοι· κοιμήθητι μετ’ ἐμοῦ.
18 Ὡς δὲ ἤκουσεν ὅτι ὕψωσα τὴν φωνήν μου καὶ ἐβόησα, κατέλιπε
19 τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ παρ’ ἐμοί, καὶ ἔφυγε, καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ἔξω. Ἐγένετο
    δὲ ὡς ἤκουσεν ὁ κύριος αὐτοῦ τὰ ῥήματα τῆς γυναικὸς αὑτοῦ,
    ὅσα ἐλάλησε πρὸς αὐτόν, λέγουσα· οὕτως ἐποίησέ μοι ὁ παῖς
20 σου, καὶ ἐθυμώθη ὀργῇ· καὶ ἔλαβεν ὁ κύριος Ἰωσήφ, καὶ ἀνέβαλεν
    αὐτὸν εἰς τὸ ὀχύρωμα, εἰς τὸν τόπον ἐν ᾧ οἱ δεσμῶται τοῦ
21 βασιλέως κατέχονται ἐκεῖ ἐν τῷ ὀχυρώματι. Καὶ ἦν Κύριος μετὰ
    Ἰωσήφ, καὶ κατέσχεν αὐτοῦ ἔλεος, καὶ ἔδωκεν [αὐτῷ χάριν
22 ἐναντίον τοῦ ἀρχιδεσμοφύλακος. Καὶ ἔδωκεν ὁ ἀρχιδεσμοφύλαξ τὸ
    δεσμωτήριον διὰ χειρὸς Ἰωσήφ, καὶ πάντας τοὺς ἀπηγμένους ὅσοι
    ἐν τῷ δεσμωτηρίῳ· καὶ πάντα ὅσα ποιοῦσιν ἐκεῖ, αὐτὸς ἦν ποιῶν.
23 Οὐκ ἦν ὁ ἀρχιδεσμοφύλαξ γινώσκων δι’ αὐτὸν οὐδέν· πάντα
    γὰρ ἦν διὰ χειρὸς Ἰωσήφ, διὰ τὸ τὸν Κύριον μετ’ αὐτοῦ εἶναι·
    καὶ ὅσα αὐτὸς ἐποίει, Κύριος εὐόδου ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτοῦ.

                      ΚΕΦ. Μ΄. XL.

 1 Ἐγένετο δὲ μετὰ τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα ἥμαρτον ὁ ἀρχιοινοχόος
    τοῦ βασιλέως Αἰγύπτου, καὶ ὁ ἀρχισιτοποιὸς τῷ κυρίῳ αὑτῶν
 2 τῷ βασιλεῖ Αἰγύπτου. Καὶ ὠργίσθη Φαραὼ ἐπὶ τοῖς δυσὶν
    εὐνούχοις αὐτοῦ, ἐπὶ τῷ ἀρχιοινοχόῳ καὶ ἐπὶ τῷ ἀρχισιτοποιῷ·
 3 καὶ ἔθετο αὐτοὺς ἐν φυλακῇ παρὰ τῷ ἀρχιμαγείρῳ εἰς τὸ
 4 δεσμωτήριον, εἰς τὸν τόπον οὗ Ἰωσὴφ ἀπῆκτο ἐκεῖ. Καὶ συνέστησεν
    ὁ ἀρχιδεσμώτης τῷ Ἰωσὴφ αὐτούς, καὶ παρέστη αὐτοῖς· ἦσαν
 5 δὲ ἡμέρας ἐν τῇ φυλακῇ. Καὶ ἴδον ἀμφότεροι ἐνύπνιον, ἑκάτερος
    ἐνύπνιον ἐν μιᾷ νυκτί· ὅρασις τοῦ ἐνυπνίου αὐτοῦ, ὁ ἀρχιοινοχόος
    καὶ ὁ ἀρχισιτοποιός, οἳ ἦσαν τῷ βασιλεῖ Αἰγύπτου, οἱ ὄντες ἐν
 6 τῷ δεσμωτηρίῳ. Εἰσῆλθε δὲ πρὸς αὐτοὺς τὸ πρωί· Ἰωσήφ, καὶ

**GENESIS CHAPTER 39**

14 saying, "Come, he brought in unto us a Hebrew servant to mock us." And he came in
15 unto me, saying, "Lie with me"; and I cried out with a loud voice. And when he heard that I had lifted up my voice and cried out, he left his garments with me, and fled, and went forth abroad.
16 And she kept the garments by her, until her lord came into his house.
17 And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, "The Hebrew servant, whom thou didst bring unto us, came in unto me to mock me, and said unto me, 'Lie with me.'
18 And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried out, he left his garments with me, and fled, and went forth abroad."
19 And it came to pass, when his lord heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, "Thus hath thy servant done unto me," that his wrath was kindled.
20 And Joseph’s lord took him, and cast him into the prison, into the place wherein the king's prisoners were held there in the prison.
21 But the Lord was with Joseph, and He held mercy upon him, and gave [him favor] in the sight of the chief jailer.
22 And the chief jailer committed the prison into Joseph’s hand, and all the prisoners who were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he himself was the doer.
23 The chief jailer knew nothing concerning him; for all things were in Joseph’s hand, because the Lord was with him; and whatsoever he did, the Lord of prosperity was in his hands.

**CHAPTER 40**

1 And it came to pass after these words, that the chief butler of the king of Egypt and the chief baker sinned against their lord, the king of Egypt.
2 And Pharaoh was wroth against his two eunuchs, against the chief butler and against the chief baker;
3 and he put them in ward with the chief cook, into the prison, into the place where Joseph was confined there.
4 And the chief jailer committed them unto Joseph, and he served them; and they were [there] for days in the ward.
5 And they both dreamed a dream, each man his dream in one night; a vision of his dream, [even for] the chief butler and the chief baker, who were [servants] to the king of Egypt, [even for] those who were in the prison.
6 And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and
