καὶ προκατελάβοντο τὸ ὕδωρ ἕως Βαιθ-θηρὰ καὶ τὸν Ἰορδάνην.
**25.** Καὶ συνέλαβον τοὺς δύο ἄρχοντας Μαδιάμ, τὸν Ὠρὴβ καὶ τὸν Ζήβ·
καὶ ἀπέκτειναν τὸν Ὠρὴβ ἐν Σουρ-ωέβ, καὶ τὸν Ζὴβ ἀπέ-
κτειναν ἐν Ἰακεφ-ζήβ, καὶ κατεδίωξαν Μαδιάμ· καὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν
Ὠρὴβ καὶ Ζὴβ ἤνεγκαν πρὸς Γεδεὼν ἐκ τοῦ πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου.

**1.** ΚΑΙ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτὸν ἀνὴρ Ἐφραίμ· τί τὸ ἔζημα τοῦτο ἐποίησας ἡμῖν, τοῦ μὴ καλέσαι ἡμᾶς, ὅτε ἐξεπορεύου πολεμῆσαι ἐν
τῇ Μαδιάμ; καὶ ἐκρίνοντο μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ κραταιῶς.
**2.** Καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτοὺς· τί ἐποίησα νῦν καθὼς ὑμεῖς; Οὐχὶ κρείττω ἐπιφυλλίδες
Ἐφραὶμ ἢ τρυγητὸς Ἀβιέζερ;
**3.** Ἐν χειρὶ ὑμῶν παρέδωκε Κύριος τοὺς ἄρχοντας Μαδιάμ, τὸν Ὠρὴβ καὶ τὸν Ζήβ· καὶ τί ἠδυνάσθην
ποιῆσαι καθὼς ὑμεῖς; καὶ κατέπαυσαν. Τότε ἀνῆκε τὸ πνεῦμα
αὐτῶν ἀπ᾿ αὐτοῦ, ἐν τῷ λαλῆσαι αὐτὸν τὸν λόγον τοῦτον.
**4.** Καὶ ἦλθε Γεδεὼν ἐπὶ τὸν Ἰορδάνην, καὶ διέβη αὐτός, καὶ τριακόσιοι
ἄνδρες οἱ μετ᾿ αὐτοῦ, ὀλιγοψυχοῦντες καὶ πεινῶντες.
**5.** Καὶ εἶπε τοῖς ἀνδράσι Σοκχώθ· δότε δὴ ἄρτους τῷ λαῷ τῷ μετ᾿ ἐμοῦ, ὅτι πεινῶσιν· ἐγὼ δὲ διώκω ὀπίσω Ζεβεὲ καὶ Σαλμανὰ βασιλέων Μαδιάμ.
**6.** Καὶ εἶπαν οἱ ἄρχοντες Σοκχώθ· μὴ χεὶρ Ζεβεὲ καὶ Σαλμανὰ νῦν ἐν τῇ χειρί σου, ὅτι δώσομεν τῇ στρατείᾳ σου ἄρτους;
**7.** Καὶ εἶπε Γεδεών· οὐχ οὕτως· ἐν τῷ δοῦναι Κύριον τὸν Ζεβεὲ καὶ Σαλμανὰ
ἐν τῇ χειρί μου, καὶ καταξανῶ τὰς σάρκας ὑμῶν ἐν ταῖς ἀκάνθαις
τῆς ἐρήμου καὶ ἐν ταῖς Βαρκοννείμ.
**8.** Καὶ ἀνέβη ἐκεῖθεν εἰς Φανουήλ, καὶ ἐλάλησε πρὸς αὐτοὺς κατὰ ταῦτα. Καὶ ἀπεκρίθησαν αὐτῷ
οἱ ἄνδρες Φανουήλ, ὃν τρόπον ἀπεκρίθησαν αὐτῷ οἱ ἄνδρες Σοκ-
χώθ.
**9.** Καὶ εἶπε τοῖς ἀνδράσι Φανουήλ, λέγων· ἐν τῷ ἐπιστρέφειν
με μετ᾿ εἰρήνης, κατασκάψω τὸν πύργον τοῦτον.
**10.** Καὶ Ζεβεὲ καὶ Σαλμανὰ ἐν Καρκάρ, καὶ ἡ παρεμβολὴ αὐτῶν μετ᾿ αὐτῶν ὡσεὶ
πεντεκαίδεκα χιλιάδες, πάντες καταλειφθέντες υἱοὶ ἀνατολῶν· καὶ οἱ
πεπτωκότες ἦσαν ἑκατὸν καὶ εἴκοσι χιλιάδες ἀνδρῶν ἐσπασμένων
ῥομφαίαν.
**11.** Καὶ ἀνέβη Γεδεὼν ὁδὸν κατοικούντων ἐν σκηναῖς ἀπὸ
ἀνατολῶν τῆς Ναβὲθ ἐξ ἐναντίας Ζεβεέ· καὶ ἐπάταξε τὴν παρεμ-
βολήν, ἡ δὲ παρεμβολὴ ἦν πεποιθυῖα.
**12.** Καὶ ἔφυγε Ζεβεὲ καὶ Σαλμανά, καὶ ἐδίωξεν ὀπίσω αὐτῶν· καὶ ἐκράτησε τοὺς δύο βασιλεῖς

**JUDGES**
**CHAPTER 7.**

**25.** and they seized the waters unto Beth-barah and the Jordan. And they captured the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the Rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they slew by the Winepress of Zeeb; and they pursued Midian; and the head of Oreb and Zeeb they brought unto Gideon from beyond the Jordan.

**CHAPTER 8.**

**1.** And the men of Ephraim said unto him, "What manner of thing is this that thou hast done unto us, in that thou didst not call us, when thou wentest to fight with Midian?" And they did chide with him sharply.
**2.** And he said unto them, "What have I done now in comparison of you? Is not the gleaning of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?"
**3.** Into your hand hath the Lord delivered the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and what was I able to do in comparison of you?" And they were appeased. Then their spirit subsided from him, when he had spoken this word.
**4.** And Gideon came unto the Jordan, and he passed over, and the three hundred men that were with him, weary and hungry.
**5.** And he said unto the men of Succoth, "Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that are with me, for they are hungry; for I do pursue after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian."
**6.** And the princes of Succoth said, "Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thine army?"
**7.** And Gideon said, "Not so; when the Lord hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then will I tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with the Barkonneim [briers]."
**8.** And he went up thence to Penuel, and spoke unto them likewise. And the men of Penuel answered him in the same manner as the men of Succoth had answered him.
**9.** And he said unto the men of Penuel, saying, "When I return in peace, I will demolish this tower."
**10.** Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their host with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of the sons of the east; for those who had fallen were one hundred and twenty thousand men that drew the sword.
**11.** And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents, from the east of Nobah, facing Zebah; and smote the host; for the host was secure.
**12.** And Zebah and Zalmunna fled, and he pursued after them; and he captured the two kings of Midian, even Zebah and Zalmunna.
