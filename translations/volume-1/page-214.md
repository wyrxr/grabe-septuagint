ΚΕΦ. ΙΔʹ. ΛΕΥΙΤΙΚΟΝ 199
τὸν λοβὸν τοῦ ὠτὸς τοῦ καθαριζομένου τοῦ δεξιοῦ, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸ
ἄκρον τῆς χειρὸς αὐτοῦ τῆς δεξιᾶς, καὶ ἐπὶ τὸ ἄκρον τοῦ ποδὸς
αὐτοῦ τοῦ δεξιοῦ, ἐπὶ τὸν τόπον τοῦ αἵματος τοῦ τῆς πλημμελείας·
τὸ δὲ καταλειφθὲν ἀπὸ τοῦ ἐλαίου, τὸ ὂν ἐπὶ τῆς χειρὸς τοῦ 29
ἱερέως, ἐπιθήσει ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν τοῦ καθαριζομένου· καὶ ἐξιλάσε-
ται περὶ αὐτοῦ ὁ ἱερεὺς ἔναντι Κυρίου. Καὶ ποιήσει μίαν ἀπὸ 30
τῶν τρυγόνων ἢ ἀπὸ τῶν νεοσσῶν τῶν περιστερῶν, καθότι εὗρεν
αὐτοῦ ἡ χείρ, τὴν μίαν περὶ ἁμαρτίας, καὶ τὴν μίαν εἰς ὁλοκαύ- 31
τωμα, σὺν τῇ θυσίᾳ· καὶ ἐξιλάσεται ὁ ἱερεὺς περὶ τοῦ καθαριζο-
μένου ἔναντι Κυρίου. Οὗτος ὁ νόμος ἐν ᾧ ἐστιν ἡ ἁφὴ λέπρας, 32
καὶ τοῦ μὴ εὑρίσκοντος τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸν καθαρισμὸν αὐ-
τοῦ. Καὶ ἐλάλησε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν καὶ πρὸς Ἀαρών, λέ- 33
γων· ὡς ἂν εἰσέλθητε εἰς τὴν γῆν τῶν Χαναναίων, ἣν ἐγὼ δίδωμι 34
ὑμῖν ἐν κτήσει, καὶ δώσω ἁφὴν λέπρας ἐν ταῖς οἰκίαις τῆς γῆς
τῆς ἐγκτήτου ὑμῖν, καὶ ἥξει τινὸς αὐτοῦ ἡ οἰκία, καὶ ἀναγγελῇ 35
τῷ ἱερεῖ, λέγων· ὥσπερ ἁφὴ ἑώραταί μοι ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ· καὶ προ- 36
στάξει ὁ ἱερεὺς ἀποσκευάσαι τὴν οἰκίαν, πρὸ τοῦ εἰσελθόντα ἰ-
δεῖν τὸν ἱερέα τὴν ἁφήν, καὶ οὐ μὴ ἀκάθαρτα γένηται, ὅσα ἐὰν
ᾖ ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ· καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα εἰσελεύσεται ὁ ἱερεὺς καταμαθεῖν
τὴν οἰκίαν καὶ ὄψεται τὴν ἁφήν, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἡ ἁφὴ ἐν τοῖς τοίχοις 37
τῆς οἰκίας, κοιλάδας χλωριζούσας, ἢ πυῤῥιζούσας, καὶ ἡ ὄψις
αὐτῶν ταπεινοτέρα τῶν τοίχων· καὶ ἐξελθὼν ὁ ἱερεὺς ἐκ τῆς οἰ- 38
κίας ἐπὶ τὴν θύραν τῆς οἰκίας, καὶ ἀφοριεῖ ὁ ἱερεὺς τὴν οἰκίαν
ἑπτὰ ἡμέρας. Καὶ ἐπανήξει ὁ ἱερεὺς τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ, καὶ 39
ὄψεται τὴν οἰκίαν, καὶ ἰδοὺ διεχύθη ἡ ἁφὴ ἐν τοῖς τοίχοις
τῆς οἰκίας. Καὶ προστάξει ὁ ἱερεὺς καὶ ἐξελοῦσι τοὺς λίθους ἐν 40
οἷς ἐστιν ἡ ἁφή, καὶ ἐκβαλοῦσιν αὐτοὺς ἔξω τῆς πόλεως εἰς τό-
πον ἀκάθαρτον· καὶ ἀποξύσουσι τὴν οἰκίαν ἔσωθεν κύκλῳ, καὶ ἐκ- 41
χεοῦσι τὸν χοῦν ὃν ἀπέξυσαν, ἔξω τῆς πόλεως εἰς τόπον ἀκά-
θαρτον· καὶ λήψονται λίθους ἀπεξυσμένους ἑτέρους, καὶ ἀντιθήσουσιν 42
ἀντὶ τῶν λίθων· καὶ χοῦν ἕτερον λήψονται, καὶ ἐξαλείψουσι τὴν
οἰκίαν. Ἐὰν δὲ ἐπέλθῃ πάλιν ἀφή, καὶ ἀνατείλῃ ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ, 43
μετὰ τὸ ἐξελεῖν τοὺς λίθους, καὶ μετὰ τὸ ἀποξυσθῆναι τὴν οἰ-
κίαν, καὶ μετὰ τὸ ἐξαλειφθῆναι, καὶ εἰσελεύσεται ὁ ἱερεύς, καὶ 44
ὄψεται· εἰ διακέχυται ἡ ἁφὴ ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ, λέπρα ἔμμονος ἐστιν
ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ, ἀκάθαρτός ἐστι. Καὶ καθελοῦσι τὴν οἰκίαν, καὶ τὰ 45

*Correction made: In verse 39, the parenthetical (οὐ) has been removed. Its presence creates a textual improbability, as the subsequent verses describe actions that would only occur if the plague *had* spread or persisted, not if it had *not* spread.*

### LEVITICUS CHAPTER 14

**29** And that which remaineth of the oil that is upon the priest's hand, he shall lay upon the head of him that is to be cleansed; and the priest shall make atonement for him before the Lord.
**30** And he shall offer one of the turtledoves, or of the young pigeons, such as his hand may find, the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering,
**31** with the grain offering; and the priest shall make atonement for him that is to be cleansed before the Lord.
**32** This is the law for him in whom is the plague of leprosy, and whose hand cannot find [sufficient] for his cleansing.

**33** And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying:
**34** When ye shall come into the land of the Canaanites, which I do give to you for a possession, then I will put a plague of leprosy in the houses of the land of your possession.
**35** And when he whose house it is shall come and tell the priest, saying, As it were, a plague hath appeared unto me in the house.
**36** Then shall the priest command that they empty the house, before the priest go in to see the plague, that whatsoever is in the house become not unclean; and afterward shall the priest go in to observe the house.
**37** And he shall look upon the plague; and behold, if the plague be in the walls of the house, in hollows greenish or reddish, and the appearance thereof be deeper than the walls;
**38** then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and the priest shall shut up the house seven days.
**39** And the priest shall come again on the seventh day, and shall look upon the house; and behold, if the plague be spread in the walls of the house;
**40** then the priest shall command, and they shall take out the stones wherein the plague is, and they shall cast them forth outside the city into an unclean place.
**41** And they shall scrape the house within all around, and they shall pour out the dust which they have scraped off outside the city into an unclean place.
**42** And they shall take other scraped stones, and shall put them in the place of those stones; and they shall take other mortar, and shall plaster the house.
**43** And if the plague shall come again and break out in the house, after the stones have been taken out, and after the house has been scraped, and after it hath been plastered, then the priest shall come in and shall look;
**44** and behold, if the plague be spread in the house, it is a lasting leprosy in the house, it is unclean.
**45** And they shall pull down the house, and the...
