ΚΕΦ. ΙΘ΄. ΙΗΣΟΥΣ ΝΑΥΗ 412

**45** θῶθ, καὶ Ἰούθ, καὶ Βαηθεβαράχ, καὶ Γεθρεμμῶν,
**46** καὶ ἀπὸ θαλάσσης
**48** Ἱερακών, καὶ Ἡρακών, ὄριον πλησίον Ἰόππης. Αὕτη ἡ κληρονομία φυλῆς υἱῶν Δὰν κατὰ δήμους αὐτῶν, αἱ πόλεις αὗται καὶ αἱ κῶμαι αὐτῶν. Καὶ οὐκ ἐξέθλιψαν οἱ υἱοὶ Δὰν τὸν Ἀμοῤῥαῖον τὸν θλίβοντα αὐτοὺς ἐν τῷ ὄρει· καὶ οὐκ εἴων αὐτοὺς οἱ Ἀμοῤῥαῖοι καταβαίνειν εἰς τὴν κοιλάδα, καὶ ἔθλιβον ἀπ᾽ αὐτῶν τὸ ὄριον τῆς
**47** μερίδος αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐξῆλθεν τὸ ὄριον υἱῶν Δὰν ἀπ᾽ αὐτῶν· καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν οἱ υἱοὶ Δὰν, καὶ ἐπολέμησαν τὴν Λεσὲμ, καὶ κατελάβοντο αὐτὴν, καὶ ἐπάταξαν αὐτὴν ἐν στόματι μαχαίρας· καὶ κατεπάτησαν αὐτὴν, καὶ ἐκάλεσαν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτῆς Λεσεν-Δὰν κατὰ τὸ ὄνομα Δὰν πατρὸς αὐτῶν. Καὶ δ᾽ Ἀμοῤῥαῖος ὑπέμεινε τοῦ κατοικεῖν ἐν Ἑλὼν, καὶ ἐν Σαλαμείν· καὶ ἐβαρύνθη ἡ χεὶρ τοῦ Ἐφραὶμ ἐπ᾽
**49** αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἐγένοντο αὐτοῖς εἰς φόρον. Καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν ἐμβατεῦσαι τὴν γῆν κατὰ τὸ ὄριον αὐτῶν· καὶ ἔδωκαν οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ κλῆρον
**50** Ἰησοῦ υἱῷ Ναυῆ ἐν αὐτοῖς διὰ προστάγματος Κυρίου, καὶ ἔδωκαν αὐτῷ τὴν πόλιν, ἣν ᾐτήσατο, Θαμναβσαρὰχ, ἢ ἔστιν ἐν τῷ ὄρει
**51** Ἐφραίμ· καὶ ᾠκοδόμησε τὴν πόλιν, καὶ κατώκει ἐν αὐτῇ. Αὗται αἱ διαιρέσεις ἃς κατεκληρονόμησαν Ἐλεάζαρ ὁ ἱερεὺς, καὶ Ἰησοῦς ὁ τοῦ Ναυῆ, καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες πατριῶν ἐν ταῖς φυλαῖς τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ, κατὰ κλήρους ἐν Σιλὼ ἔναντι Κυρίου παρὰ τὰς θύρας τῆς σκηνῆς τοῦ μαρτυρίου· καὶ ἐπορεύθησαν ἐμβατεῦσαι τὴν γῆν.

ΚΕΦ. Κ´. ΧΧ.

**1** ΚΑΙ ἐλάλησε Κύριος τῷ Ἰησοῦ, λέγων·
**2** λάλησον τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραὴλ, λέγων· δότε ὑμῖν τὰς πόλεις τῶν φυγαδευτηρίων, ἃς
**3** εἶπα πρὸς ὑμᾶς διὰ Μωυσῆ· φυγαδευτήριον τῷ φονευτῇ τῷ πατάξαντι ψυχὴν ἀκουσίως ἄνευ προνοίας· καὶ ἔσονται ὑμῖν αἱ πόλεις φυγαδευτήριον, καὶ οὐκ ἀποθανεῖται ὁ φονευτὴς ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀγχιστεύοντος τὸ αἷμα, ἕως ἂν καταστῇ ἐναντίον τῆς συναγωγῆς εἰς κρίσιν.
**4** Καὶ φεύξεται εἰς μίαν τῶν πόλεων τούτων, καὶ στήσεται ἐπὶ τὴν θύραν τῆς πύλης τῆς πόλεως, καὶ λαλήσει ἐν τοῖς ὠσὶ τῶν πρεσβυτέρων τῆς πόλεως ἐκείνης τοὺς λόγους αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐπιστρέψουσιν αὐτὸν ἡ συναγωγὴ πρὸς αὐτοὺς, καὶ δώσουσιν αὐτῷ τόπον, καὶ
**5** κατοικήσει μετ᾽ αὐτῶν. Καὶ ἐὰν διώξεται ὁ ἀγχιστεύων τὸ αἷμα ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐ συγκλείσουσιν τὸν φονεύσαντα ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ·

**Joshua 19**

<sup>45</sup> and Baalath, and Jehud, and Baalath-beer, and Gath-rimmon,
<sup>46</sup> and from the sea [unto]
<sup>48</sup> Herakon, and Herakon, a boundary near Joppa. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities and their unwalled towns. And the children of Dan did not drive out the Amorite who oppressed them in the mountain; and the Amorites did not suffer them to come down into the valley, and they pressed them back from the boundary of their
<sup>47</sup> portion. And the boundary of the children of Dan departed from them; and the children of Dan went forth, and they fought against Leshem, and seized it, and smote it with the edge of the sword; and they trod it down, and called the name thereof Lesen-Dan, after the name of Dan their father. But the Amorite remained to dwell in Elon and in Shaalabbin; and the hand of Ephraim became heavy upon
<sup>49</sup> them, and they became unto them a tribute. And they went forth to take possession of the land according to their boundary; and the children of Israel gave an inheritance to
<sup>50</sup> Joshua the son of Nun among them by the commandment of the Lord, and they gave him the city which he asked for, Timnath-serah, which is in the mountain of
<sup>51</sup> Ephraim; and he built the city, and dwelt therein. These are the divisions which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the chiefs of the fathers in the tribes of Israel did inherit by lot in Shiloh before the Lord at the doors of the Tent of Testimony; and they went forth to take possession of the land.

**Joshua 20**

<sup>1</sup> AND the Lord spake unto Joshua, saying,
<sup>2</sup> Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Appoint for yourselves the cities of refuge, which
<sup>3</sup> I spake unto you by Moses; a refuge for the manslayer who smiteth a soul unwittingly, without forethought. And these cities shall be a refuge for you, and the manslayer shall not die by the avenger of blood, until he stand before the assembly for judgment.
<sup>4</sup> And he shall flee unto one of these cities, and shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city, and shall declare his words in the ears of the elders of that city; and the assembly shall receive him unto them, and they shall give him a place, and
<sup>5</sup> he shall dwell among them. And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not deliver the manslayer into his hand;
