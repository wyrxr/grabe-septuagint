ΕΞΟΔΟΣ ΚΕΦ. ΛΔ΄. ΛΕ΄.
αἷμα θυσιάσματός μου· καὶ οὐ κοιμηθήσεται εἰς τὸ πρωὶ θυμίαμα
26 ἑορτῆς τοῦ πάσχα. Τὰ πρωτογεννήματα τῆς γῆς σου εἰςίσεις
εἰς τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ σου. Οὐχ ἐψήσεις ἄρνα ἐν γά-
27 λακτι μητρὸς αὐτοῦ. Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν· γράφον σεαυ-
τῷ τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα· ἐπὶ γὰρ τῶν λόγων τούτων τέθειμαί σοι
28 διαθήκην, καὶ τῷ Ἰσραήλ. Καὶ ἦν ἐκεῖ Μωυσῆς ἔναντι Κυρίου
τεσσαράκοντα ἡμέρας καὶ τεσσαράκοντα νύκτας· ἄρτον οὐκ ἔφαγε,
καὶ ὕδωρ οὐκ ἔπιε· καὶ ἔγραφεν ἐπὶ τῶν (δύο) πλακῶν τὰ ῥήμα-
29 τα ταῦτα τῆς διαθήκης, τοὺς δέκα λόγους. Ὡς δὲ κατέβαινε Μωυσῆς
ἀπὸ τοῦ ὄρους Σινᾶ, καὶ αἱ δύο πλάκες τῆς διαθήκης ἐπὶ τῶν
χειρῶν Μωυσῆ· καταβαίνοντος δὲ αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τοῦ ὄρους, καὶ Μωυσῆς
οὐκ ᾔδει ὅτι δεδόξασται ἡ ὄψις τοῦ χρωτὸς τοῦ προσώπου
30 αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ λαλεῖν αὐτὸν αὐτῷ. Καὶ ἴδεν Ἀαρὼν καὶ πάντες
οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ τὸν Μωυσῆν, καὶ ἦν δεδοξασμένη ἡ ὄψις τοῦ
31 χρωτὸς τοῦ προσώπου αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν ἐγγίσαι αὐτῷ. Καὶ
ἐκάλεσεν αὐτοὺς Μωυσῆς, καὶ ἐπεστράφησαν πρὸς αὐτὸν Ἀαρὼν
καὶ πάντες οἱ ἄρχοντες τῆς συναγωγῆς· καὶ ἐλάλησε Μωυσῆς
32 πρὸς αὐτούς. Καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα προσῆλθον πρὸς αὐτὸν πάντες οἱ
υἱοὶ Ἰσραήλ· καὶ ἐνετείλατο αὐτοῖς πάντα, ὅσα ἐλάλησε Κύριος
33 πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐν τῷ ὄρει Σινᾶ. Καὶ ἐπειδὴ κατέπαυσε Μωυσῆς λαλῶν
πρὸς αὐτοὺς, ἐπέθηκεν ἐπὶ τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ κάλυμμα.
34 Ἡνίκα δ᾿ ἂν εἰςεπορεύετο Μωυσῆς ἔναντι Κυρίου λαλεῖν αὐτῷ,
περιῃρεῖτο τὸ κάλυμμα ἕως τοῦ ἐκπορεύεσθαι· καὶ ἐξελθὼν ἐλά-
35 λει πᾶσι τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραὴλ ὅσα ἐνετείλατο αὐτῷ Κύριος. Καὶ ἴδον
οἱ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ τὸ πρόσωπον Μωυσῆ, ὅτι δεδόξασται· καὶ περιείθηκε
Μωυσῆς τὸ κάλυμμα ἐπὶ τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ, ἕως ἂν εἰςέλθῃ
συλλαλεῖν αὐτῷ.

ΚΕΦ. ΛΕ΄. XXXV.

**ΚΑΙ** συνήθροισε Μωυσῆς πᾶσαν τὴν συναγωγὴν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ,
καὶ εἶπε πρὸς αὐτούς· οὗτοι οἱ λόγοι, οὓς εἶπε Κύριος ποιῆσαι
2 αὐτούς. Ἕξ ἡμέρας ποιήσεις ἔργα, τῇ δὲ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ κατά-
παυσις, ἅγιον σάββατον, ἀνάπαυσις τῷ Κυρίῳ· πᾶς ὁ ποιῶν ἐν
3 αὐτῇ ἔργον, τελευτάτω. Οὐ καύσετε πῦρ ἐν πάσῃ κατοικίᾳ ὑμῶν
4 ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῶν σαββάτων· ἐγὼ Κύριος. Καὶ εἶπε Μωυσῆς πρὸς

#### Exodus

**Chapter 34**

...the blood of My sacrifice, and the incense of the feast of the Passover
shall not lie overnight until the morning.
**26** Thou shalt cause [the] firstfruits of thy land to enter into the house
of the Lord thy God. Thou shalt not boil a lamb in its mother's milk.
**27** And the Lord said unto Moses: "Write thou for thyself these words;
for upon these words have I made a covenant with thee, and with Israel."
**28** And Moses was there before the Lord forty days and forty nights;
he did eat no bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the (two)
tablets these words of the covenant, the ten words.
**29** And when Moses came down from Mount Sinai, with the two
tablets of the covenant in Moses' hands, as he came down from the
mountain, Moses knew not that the skin of his face was glorified
**30** when he spake with Him. And Aaron and all the sons of Israel
saw Moses, and behold, the skin of his face was glorified;
**31** and they feared to draw nigh unto him. And Moses called them,
and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him;
and Moses spake unto them.
**32** And afterward all the sons of Israel came near unto him; and he
commanded them all things whatsoever the Lord had spoken unto him
in Mount Sinai.
**33** And when Moses had ceased speaking with them, he put a veil
upon his face.
**34** But when Moses went in before the Lord to speak with Him, he
would take off the veil until he came out. And when he had gone out,
he spake unto all the sons of Israel all that the Lord had commanded him.
**35** And the sons of Israel saw the face of Moses, that it was glorified;
and Moses put the veil upon his face again, until he went in to speak with Him.

**Chapter 35**

**1** And Moses gathered all the congregation of the sons of Israel
together, and said unto them: "These are the words which the Lord
hath commanded, that ye should do them.
**2** Six days shall ye do work, but on the seventh day shall be a rest,
a holy Sabbath, a rest unto the Lord; whosoever doeth work therein,
he shall be put to death.
**3** Ye shall kindle no fire throughout all your habitations upon the
day of the Sabbaths;
**4** I am the Lord." And Moses spake unto...
