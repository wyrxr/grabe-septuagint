ἐπελέξε Μωυσῆς ἄνδρας δυνατοὺς ἀπὸ παντὸς Ἰσραήλ, καὶ ἐποίησεν αὐτοὺς ἐπ’ αὐτῶν χιλιάρχους καὶ ἑκατοντάρχους καὶ πεντηκοντάρχους καὶ δεκαδάρχους καὶ γραμματοεισαγωγεῖς, καὶ ἔκρινον 26
τὸν λαὸν πᾶσαν ὥραν· τὸ δὲ ῥῆμα τὸ ὑπέρογκον ἀνέφερον πρὸς Μωυσῆν, πᾶν δὲ ῥῆμα ἐλαφρὸν ἔκρινον αὐτοί. Ἐξαπέστειλε δὲ 27
Μωυσῆς τὸν γαμβρὸν ἑαυτοῦ, καὶ ἀπῆλθεν εἰς τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ.

ΚΕΦ. ΙΘʹ. XIX.

Τοῦ δὲ μηνὸς τοῦ τρίτου τῆς ἐξόδου τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ ἐκ 1
τῆς Αἰγύπτου τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ταύτῃ, ἦλθον εἰς τὴν ἔρημον Σινά· καὶ 2
ἐξῆραν ἐκ Ῥαφιδεῖν, καὶ ἦλθον εἰς τὴν ἔρημον τοῦ Σινᾶ, καὶ παρενέβαλεν ἐκεῖ Ἰσραήλ κατέναντι τοῦ ὄρους. Καὶ Μωυσῆς ἀνέβη 3
εἰς τὸ ὄρος τοῦ Θεοῦ· καὶ ἐκάλεσεν αὐτὸν ὁ Θεὸς ἐκ τοῦ ὄρους, λέγων· τάδε ἐρεῖς τῷ οἴκῳ Ἰακώβ, καὶ ἀναγγελεῖς τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ·
αὐτοὶ ἑωράκατε ὅσα πεποίηκα τοῖς Αἰγυπτίοις, καὶ ἀνέλαβον ὑμᾶς 4
ὡσεὶ ἐπὶ πτερύγων ἀετῶν, καὶ προσηγαγόμην ὑμᾶς πρὸς ἐμαυτόν. Καὶ νῦν ἐὰν ἀκοῇ ἀκούσητε τῆς φωνῆς μου, καὶ 5
φυλάξητε τὴν διαθήκην μου, ἔσεσθέ μοι λαὸς περιούσιος ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν ἐθνῶν· ἐμὴ γάρ ἐστι πᾶσα ἡ γῆ, ὑμεῖς δὲ ἔσεσθέ μοι 6
βασίλειον ἱεράτευμα καὶ ἔθνος ἅγιον· ταῦτα τὰ ῥήματα ἐρεῖς τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ. Ἦλθε δὲ Μωυσῆς, καὶ ἐκάλεσε τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους 7
τοῦ λαοῦ, καὶ παρέθηκεν αὐτοῖς πάντας τοὺς λόγους τούτους, οὓς συνέταξεν αὐτοῖς ὁ Θεός. Καὶ ἀπεκρίθη πᾶς ὁ λαὸς ὁμοθυμαδόν, 8
καὶ εἶπαν· πάντα ὅσα εἶπεν ὁ Θεός, ποιήσομεν, καὶ ἀκουσόμεθα. Ἀνήνεγκε δὲ Μωυσῆς τοὺς λόγους τοῦ λαοῦ πρὸς τὸν 9
Θεόν. Εἶπε δὲ Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν· Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ παραγίνομαι πρὸς σέ ἐν στύλῳ νεφέλης, ἵνα ἀκούσῃ ὁ λαὸς λαλοῦντός μου πρὸς σέ, καὶ σοὶ πιστεύσωσιν εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα. Ἀνήγγειλε δὲ Μωυσῆς τὰ ῥήματα 10
τοῦ λαοῦ πρὸς Κύριον. Εἶπε δὲ Κύριος πρὸς Μωυσῆν· καταβὰς διαμάρτυραι τῷ λαῷ, καὶ ἅγνισον αὐτοὺς σήμερον καὶ αὔριον, καὶ πλυνοῦσι τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτῶν, καὶ ἔστωσαν ἕτοιμοι εἰς τὴν ἡμέραν 11
τὴν τρίτην· τῇ γὰρ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τρίτῃ καταβήσεται Κύριος ἐπὶ τὸ ὄρος Σινά, ἐναντίον παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ. Καὶ ἀφοριεῖς τὸν λαὸν κύκλῳ, 12
λέγων· προσέχετε ἑαυτοῖς τοῦ ἀναβῆναι εἰς τὸ ὄρος, καὶ θίγειν τι αὐτοῦ· πᾶς ὁ ἁψάμενος τοῦ ὄρους, θανάτῳ τελευτήσει. Οὐχ ἅψεται 13

**English Translation:**

**Chapter 18**

25 And Moses chose men of strength from all Israel, and appointed them over them to be captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens, and registrars.
26 And they judged the people at every hour; yet every weighty matter they did bring before Moses, but every light matter they themselves did judge.
27 Then Moses sent away his father-in-law, and he departed unto his own land.

**Chapter 19**

1 Now in the third month, upon the selfsame day of the children of Israel's departure from the land of Egypt, did they come into the wilderness of Sinai.
2 And they journeyed forth from Rephidim, and came into the wilderness of Sinai, and there did Israel encamp over against the mountain.
3 And Moses ascended unto the mountain of God; and God called him from the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto the house of Jacob, and declare unto the sons of Israel:
4 "Ye yourselves have seen all that I did unto the Egyptians, and how I took you up as upon the wings of eagles, and bore you unto Myself.
5 And now, if ye shall hearken indeed unto My voice, and keep My covenant, then shall ye be unto Me a treasured people, chosen from all the nations;
6 for Mine is all the earth, and ye shall be unto Me a royal priesthood and a holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the sons of Israel."
7 Then Moses came, and called the elders of the people, and laid before them all these words, which God had commanded unto them.
8 And all the people answered with one accord, and said, "All that the Lord hath spoken, we will do, and we will hearken."
9 Then Moses brought the words of the people unto the Lord. And the Lord said unto Moses, "Behold, I come unto thee in a pillar of cloud, that the people may hear Me speaking unto thee, and may believe thee unto the age [to come]."
10 Then Moses reported the words of the people unto the Lord. And the Lord said unto Moses, "Go down and solemnly warn the people, and sanctify them this day and on the morrow, and they shall wash their garments.
11 And let them be ready for the third day; for on the third day shall the Lord descend upon Mount Sinai, in the presence of all the people.
12 And thou shalt set apart the people round about, saying, 'Take heed to yourselves, that ye ascend not unto the mountain, nor touch aught thereof; whosoever toucheth the mountain, he shall surely be put to death.
13 No hand shall touch it; for he shall be stoned with stones, or shot through with a dart; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live. [But] when the voices and the trumpets and the cloud shall depart from the mountain, then they shall ascend unto the mountain."
