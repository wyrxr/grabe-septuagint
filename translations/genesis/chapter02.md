Genesis 2:1-25

Καὶ συνετελέσθησαν ὁ οὐρανὸς καὶ ἡ γῆ, καὶ πᾶς ὁ κόσμος αὐτῶν. 2 Καὶ συνετέλεσεν ὁ Θεὸς τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἕκτῃ τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ, ἃ ἐποίησε· καὶ κατέπαυσε τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν ἔργων αὐτοῦ, ὧν ἐποίησε. 3 Καὶ ηὐλόγησεν ὁ Θεὸς τὴν ἡμέραν τὴν ἑβδόμην, καὶ ἡγίασεν αὐτήν· ὅτι ἐν αὐτῇ κατέπαυσεν ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν ἔργων αὐτοῦ, ὧν ἤρξατο ὁ Θεὸς ποιῆσαι. 4 Αὕτη ἡ βίβλος γενέσεως οὐρανοῦ καὶ γῆς, ὅτε ἐγένετο, ᾗ ἡμέρᾳ ἐποίησε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ τὴν γῆν, 5 καὶ πᾶν χλωρὸν ἀγροῦ πρὸ τοῦ γενέσθαι ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, καὶ πάντα χόρτον ἀγροῦ πρὸ τοῦ ἀνατεῖλαι· οὐ γὰρ ἔβρεξε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, καὶ ἄνθρωπος οὐκ ἦν ἐργάζεσθαι τὴν γῆν. 6 Πηγὴ δὲ ἀνέβαινεν ἐκ τῆς γῆς καὶ ἐπότιζε πᾶν τὸ πρόσωπον τῆς γῆς. 7 Καὶ ἔπλασεν ὁ Θεὸς τὸν ἄνθρωπον, χοῦν ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἐνεφύσησεν εἰς τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ πνοὴν ζωῆς· καὶ ἐγένετο ὁ ἄνθρωπος εἰς ψυχὴν ζῶσαν. 8 Καὶ ἐφύτευσε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς παράδεισον ἐν Ἐδὲμ κατὰ ἀνατολάς, καὶ ἔθετο ἐκεῖ τὸν ἄνθρωπον, ὃν ἔπλασε. 9 Καὶ ἐξανέτειλεν ὁ Θεὸς ἔτι ἐκ τῆς γῆς πᾶν ξύλον ὡραῖον εἰς ὅρασιν καὶ καλὸν εἰς βρῶσιν, καὶ τὸ ξύλον τῆς ζωῆς ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ παραδείσου καὶ τὸ ξύλον τοῦ εἰδέναι γνωστὸν καλοῦ καὶ πονηροῦ. 10 Ποταμὸς δὲ ἐκπορεύεται ἐξ Ἐδὲν, ποτίζειν τὸν παράδεισον· ἐκεῖθεν ἀφορίζεται εἰς τέσσαρας ἀρχάς. 11 Ὄνομα τῷ ἑνί, Φεισών· οὗτος ὁ κυκλῶν πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν Εὐειλάτ, ἐκεῖ οὗ ἐστι τὸ χρυσίον· 12 τὸ δὲ χρυσίον τῆς γῆς ἐκείνης καλόν· καὶ ἐκεῖ ἐστιν ὁ ἄνθραξ καὶ ὁ λίθος ὁ πράσινος. 13 Καὶ ὄνομα τῷ ποταμῷ τῷ δευτέρῳ, Γηῶν· οὗτος ὁ κυκλῶν πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν Αἰθιοπίας. 14 Καὶ ὁ ποταμὸς ὁ τρίτος, Τίγρις· οὗτος ὁ πορευόμενος κατέναντι Ἀσσυρίων. Ὁ δὲ ποταμὸς ὁ τέταρτος, οὗτος Εὐφράτης. 15 Καὶ ἔλαβε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τὸν ἄνθρωπον ὃν ἔπλασε, καὶ ἔθετο αὐτὸν ἐν τῷ παραδείσῳ τῆς τρυφῆς, ἐργάζεσθαι αὐτὸν καὶ φυλάσσειν. 16 Καὶ ἐνετείλατο Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τῷ Ἀδάμ, λέγων· ἀπὸ παντὸς ξύλου τοῦ ἐν τῷ παραδείσῳ, βρώσει φάγῃ· 17 ἀπὸ δὲ τοῦ ξύλου τοῦ γινώσκειν καλὸν καὶ πονηρόν, οὐ φάγεσθε ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ· ᾗ δ’ ἂν ἡμέρᾳ φάγησθε ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ, θανάτῳ ἀποθανεῖσθε. 18 Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος ὁ Θεός· οὐ καλόν, εἶναι τὸν ἄνθρωπον μόνον· ποιήσωμεν αὐτῷ βοηθὸν κατ’ αὐτόν. 19 Καὶ ἔπλασεν ὁ Θεὸς ἔτι ἐκ τῆς γῆς πάντα τὰ θηρία τοῦ ἀγροῦ καὶ πάντα τὰ πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ ἤγαγεν αὐτὰ πρὸς τὸν Ἀδάμ, ἰδεῖν τί καλέσει αὐτά· καὶ πᾶν ὃ ἐὰν ἐκάλεσεν αὐτὸ Ἀδὰμ ψυχὴν ζῶσαν, τοῦτο ὄνομα αὐτοῦ. 20 Καὶ ἐκάλεσεν Ἀδὰμ ὀνόματα πᾶσι τοῖς κτήνεσι, καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς πετεινοῖς τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς θηρίοις τοῦ ἀγροῦ· τῷ τε Ἀδὰμ οὐχ εὑρέθη βοηθὸς ὅμοιος αὐτῷ. 21 Καὶ ἐπέβαλε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἔκστασιν ἐπὶ τὸν Ἀδάμ, καὶ ὕπνωσε· καὶ ἔλαβε μίαν τῶν πλευρῶν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀνεπλήρωσε σάρκα ἀντ’ αὐτῆς. 22 Καὶ ᾠκοδόμησε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τὴν πλευράν, ἣν ἔλαβεν ἀπὸ τοῦ Ἀδάμ, εἰς γυναῖκα, καὶ ἤγαγεν αὐτὴν πρὸς τὸν Ἀδάμ. 23 Καὶ εἶπεν Ἀδάμ· τοῦτο νῦν ὀστοῦν ἐκ τῶν ὀστέων μου, καὶ σὰρξ ἐκ τῆς σαρκός μου· αὕτη κληθήσεται γυνή, ὅτι ἐκ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς αὐτῆς ἐλήφθη αὕτη. 24 Ἕνεκεν τούτου καταλείψει ἄνθρωπος τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ καὶ τὴν μητέρα αὐτοῦ, καὶ προσκολληθήσεται τῇ γυναικὶ αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἔσονται οἱ δύο εἰς σάρκα μίαν. 25 Καὶ ἦσαν οἱ δύο γυμνοί, ὅ τε Ἀδὰμ καὶ ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἠσχύνοντο.

1 And so the heavens and the earth were finished, and all their wondrous array. 2 And God finished His works upon the sixth day, the works which He had made, and He ceased on the seventh day from all His works which He had made. 3 And God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it; for on it He ceased from all the works which God began to make.

4 This is the book of the genesis of the heavens and the earth, when they came to be, in the day that the Lord God made the heaven and the earth, 5 and every green shoot of the field before it was upon the earth, and every herb of the field before it sprang forth. For the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was no man to till the ground. 6 But a fountain welled up out of the earth and watered the whole face of the ground.

7 And God fashioned the man, [from] dust of the earth, and He breathed into his face the breath of life; and the man became a living soul. 8 And the Lord God planted a paradise in Eden toward the east, and He set there the man whom He had fashioned. 9 And God caused to grow forth yet out of the earth every tree beautiful for sight and good for food, and the tree of life in the midst of the paradise and the tree to know by a known thing [the] good and the evil.

10 And a river goeth forth from Eden to water the paradise; from there it is separated into four heads. 11 The name of the one, Phison; this is the one that doth encompass the whole land of Evilat, where there is the gold; 12 and the gold of that land is good, and there is the coal and the stone the green one. 13 And the name of the second river, Geon; this is the one that doth encompass all the land of Ethiopia. 14 And the third river, Tigris; this is the one going forth opposite the Assyrians. And the fourth river, this one [is] Euphrates.

15 And the Lord God took the man whom He had fashioned, and He set him in the paradise of delight to work it and to keep it. 16 And the Lord God gave a charge to Adam, saying, Of every tree that is in the paradise, in eating thou shalt eat; 17 but of the tree to know good and evil, ye shall not eat of it; for in whatsoever day ye shall eat of it, ye shall surely die.

18 And the Lord God said, It is not good for the man to be alone; let Us make for him a helper that is like unto him. 19 And God fashioned yet out of the earth all the beasts of the field and all the fowl of the air, and He brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them; and whatsoever Adam called it, a living soul, this was its name. 20 And Adam called names for all the cattle, and for all the fowl of the air, and for all the beasts of the field; but for Adam was not found a helper that was like unto him.

21 And the Lord God cast a trance upon Adam, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs and filled up flesh in its stead. 22 And the Lord God built the rib which He took from Adam into a woman, and He brought her unto Adam. 23 And Adam said, This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. This one shall be called Woman, for out of her man was she taken.

24 For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife; and the two shall be into one flesh. 25 And the two were naked, both Adam and his wife, and they were not ashamed.

The Holy Scripture, according to the Seventy

Genesis 2:1–25

καὶ συνετελέσθησαν ὁ οὐρανὸς καὶ ἡ γῆ, καὶ πᾶς ὁ κόσμος αὐτῶν. Καὶ συνετέλεσεν ὁ Θεὸς ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἕκτῃ τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ, ἃ ἐποίησε· καὶ κατέπαυσε τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν ἔργων αὐτοῦ, ὧν ἐποίησε. Καὶ ηὐλόγησεν ὁ Θεὸς τὴν ἡμέραν τὴν ἑβδόμην, καὶ ἡγίασεν αὐτήν· ὅτι ἐν αὐτῇ κατέπαυσεν ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν ἔργων αὐτοῦ, ὧν ἤρξατο ὁ Θεὸς ποιῆσαι.

Αὕτη ἡ βίβλος γενέσεως οὐρανοῦ καὶ γῆς, ὅτε ἐγένετο, ᾗ ἡμέρᾳ ἐποίησε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τὸν οὐρανὸν καὶ τὴν γῆν, καὶ πᾶν χλωρὸν ἀγροῦ πρὸ τοῦ γενέσθαι ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, καὶ πάντα χόρτον ἀγροῦ πρὸ τοῦ ἀνατεῖλαι· οὐ γὰρ ἔβρεξε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, καὶ ἄνθρωπος οὐκ ἦν ἐργάζεσθαι τὴν γῆν. Πηγὴ δὲ ἀνέβαινεν ἐκ τῆς γῆς καὶ ἐπότιζε πᾶν τὸ πρόσωπον τῆς γῆς. Καὶ ἔπλασεν ὁ Θεὸς τὸν ἄνθρωπον, χοῦν ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἐνεφύσησεν εἰς τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ πνοὴν ζωῆς· καὶ ἐγένετο ὁ ἄνθρωπος εἰς ψυχὴν ζῶσαν.

Καὶ ἐφύτευσε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς παράδεισον ἐν Ἐδὲμ κατὰ ἀνατολάς, καὶ ἔθετο ἐκεῖ τὸν ἄνθρωπον, ὃν ἔπλασε. Καὶ ἐξανέτειλεν ὁ Θεὸς ἔτι ἐκ τῆς γῆς πᾶν ξύλον ὡραῖον εἰς ὅρασιν καὶ καλὸν εἰς βρῶσιν, καὶ τὸ ξύλον τῆς ζωῆς ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ παραδείσου καὶ τὸ ξύλον τοῦ εἰδέναι γνωστὸν καλοῦ καὶ πονηροῦ. Ποταμὸς δὲ ἐκπορεύεται ἐξ Ἐδὲν ποτίζειν τὸν παράδεισον· ἐκεῖθεν ἀφορίζεται εἰς τέσσαρας ἀρχάς. Ὄνομα τῷ ἑνί, Φεισών· οὗτος ὁ κυκλῶν πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν Εὐειλάτ, ἐκεῖ οὗ ἐστι τὸ χρυσίον· τὸ δὲ χρυσίον τῆς γῆς ἐκείνης καλόν· καὶ ἐκεῖ ἐστιν ὁ ἄνθραξ καὶ ὁ λίθος ὁ πράσινος. Καὶ ὄνομα τῷ ποταμῷ τῷ δευτέρῳ, Γηῶν· οὗτος ὁ κυκλῶν πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν Αἰθιοπίας. Καὶ ὁ ποταμὸς ὁ τρίτος, Τίγρις· οὗτος ὁ πορευόμενος κατέναντι Ἀσσυρίων. Ὁ δὲ ποταμὸς ὁ τέταρτος, οὗτος Εὐφράτης.

Καὶ ἔλαβε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τὸν ἄνθρωπον ὃν ἔπλασε, καὶ ἔθετο αὐτὸν ἐν τῷ παραδείσῳ τῆς τρυφῆς, ἐργάζεσθαι αὐτὸν καὶ φυλάσσειν. Καὶ ἐνετείλατο Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τῷ Ἀδάμ, λέγων· ἀπὸ παντὸς ξύλου τοῦ ἐν τῷ παραδείσῳ, βρώσει φάγῃ· ἀπὸ δὲ τοῦ ξύλου τοῦ γινώσκειν καλὸν καὶ πονηρόν, οὐ φάγεσθε ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ· ᾗ δ’ ἂν ἡμέρᾳ φάγησθε ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ, θανάτῳ ἀποθανεῖσθε.

Καὶ εἶπε Κύριος ὁ Θεός· οὐ καλόν, εἶναι τὸν ἄνθρωπον μόνον· ποιήσωμεν αὐτῷ βοηθὸν κατ’ αὐτόν. Καὶ ἔπλασεν ὁ Θεὸς ἔτι ἐκ τῆς γῆς πάντα τὰ θηρία τοῦ ἀγροῦ καὶ πάντα τὰ πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ ἤγαγεν αὐτὰ πρὸς τὸν Ἀδάμ, ἰδεῖν τί καλέσει αὐτά· καὶ πᾶν ὃ ἐὰν ἐκάλεσεν αὐτὸ Ἀδὰμ ψυχὴν ζῶσαν, τοῦτο ὄνομα αὐτοῦ. Καὶ ἐκάλεσεν Ἀδὰμ ὀνόματα πᾶσι τοῖς κτήνεσι, καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς πετεινοῖς τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς θηρίοις τοῦ ἀγροῦ· τῷ δὲ Ἀδὰμ οὐχ εὑρέθη βοηθὸς ὅμοιος αὐτῷ.

Καὶ ἐπέβαλε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἔκστασιν ἐπὶ τὸν Ἀδάμ, καὶ ὕπνωσε· καὶ ἔλαβε μίαν τῶν πλευρῶν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀνεπλήρωσε σάρκα ἀντ’ αὐτῆς. Καὶ ᾠκοδόμησε Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τὴν πλευράν, ἣν ἔλαβεν ἀπὸ τοῦ Ἀδάμ, εἰς γυναῖκα, καὶ ἤγαγεν αὐτὴν πρὸς τὸν Ἀδάμ. Καὶ εἶπεν Ἀδάμ· τοῦτο νῦν ὀστοῦν ἐκ τῶν ὀστέων μου, καὶ σὰρξ ἐκ τῆς σαρκός μου· αὕτη κληθήσεται γυνή, ὅτι ἐκ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς αὐτῆς ἐλήφθη αὕτη. Ἕνεκεν τούτου καταλείψει ἄνθρωπος τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ καὶ τὴν μητέρα αὐτοῦ, καὶ προσκολληθήσεται τῇ γυναικὶ αὐτοῦ· καὶ ἔσονται οἱ δύο εἰς σάρκα μίαν. Καὶ ἦσαν οἱ δύο γυμνοί, ὅ τε Ἀδὰμ καὶ ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἠσχύνοντο.

And so the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the adornment thereof. And on the sixth day God finished His works which He had made, and He rested on the seventh day from all His works which He had made. And God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it, for on it He rested from all His works, which God had begun to make.

This is the book of the generation of heaven and of earth when they came to be, in the day that the Lord God made the heaven and the earth, and every green thing of the field before it was upon the earth, and all the grass of the field before it sprang up; for the Lord God had not sent rain upon the earth, and there was no man to cultivate the ground. But a fountain ascended from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground. And God formed the man of dust from the ground, and He breathed into his face the breath of life, and the man became a living soul.

And the Lord God planted a paradise in Eden, toward the east, and there He placed the man whom He had formed. And God caused to spring forth, yet, from the ground every tree that was beautiful to the sight and good for food, and the tree of life in the midst of the paradise, and the tree of knowing the knowledge of good and of evil. Now a river goeth out of Eden to water the paradise; from thence it is divided and becomes four heads. The name of the one is Pishon; this is it which encompasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold. And the gold of that land is good, and there is the carbuncle and the emerald stone. And the name of the second river is Gihon; this is it which encompasseth the whole land of Ethiopia. And the third river is the Tigris; this is the one which floweth before the Assyrians. And the fourth river, this is the Euphrates.

And the Lord God took the man whom He had formed and placed him in the paradise of delight, to cultivate and to keep it. And the Lord God commanded Adam, saying: Of every tree which is in the paradise, thou mayest freely eat; but of the tree of knowing good and evil, ye shall not eat of it, for in whatsoever day ye eat of it, ye shall surely die.

And the Lord God said: It is not good that the man should be alone; let us make for him a helper, according to his own nature. And God formed yet again from the earth all the beasts of the field and all the birds of the air, and He brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them; and whatsoever Adam called each living soul, that was its name. And Adam gave names to all the cattle, and to all the birds of the air, and to all the beasts of the field; but for Adam there was not found a helper like unto himself.

And the Lord God cast a trance upon Adam, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs and filled up the flesh in its place. And the Lord God fashioned the rib which He took from Adam into a woman, and He brought her unto Adam. And Adam said:

This is now bone of my bones,

and flesh of my very flesh;

She shall be called Woman,

for from her man she was taken.

For this cause a man shall leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife, and the two shall be one flesh. And they were both naked, both Adam and his wife, and they were not ashamed.
