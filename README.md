# grabe-septuagint
My work transcribing and translating the 1707 Grabe Septuagint. The PDFs are scans from the Athens reprint of 1843â€“1850, based on the Moscow edition of of 1821. The Grabe Septuagint is based on Codex Alexandrinus, which makes it unusual as most editions available today are based on Codex Vaticanus. 

Currently, transcription work is being performed using Gemini 2.5 Flash. This provides a very readable but somewhat inaccurate base. Over time I hope to correct any typographical errors in the text and provide a rough translation of the text.
